07:00.420 --> 07:06.677
Captain Walker didn't come home.

07:06.677 --> 07:11.890
His unborn child will never know him

07:11.890 --> 07:17.104
We believe him missing with a number of men,

07:17.104 --> 07:22.317
Don't expect to see him again

07:39.001 --> 07:43.172
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy

07:47.342 --> 07:52.556
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy

07:56.727 --> 08:02.983
A son! A son!

08:11.325 --> 08:17.581
A son!

08:17.581 --> 08:23.837
Hear the joyful celebrations in the street!

08:24.880 --> 08:31.136
It's a boy born on this first day of peace!

08:38.434 --> 08:44.691
We've won! A son! We've won!

10:27.377 --> 10:32.925
I'm your friendly green coat,
And I welcome you to Bernie's Holiday Camp!

10:32.925 --> 10:38.138
G'day, and you'll be happy,

10:38.138 --> 10:42.309
And it's Bernie you will thank.

10:42.309 --> 10:48.565
You must be little Tommy.
Well, call me Uncle Frank.

10:53.987 --> 10:58.867
Welcome you too, Mrs. Walker,
Here you'll always find a helping hand!

11:03.789 --> 11:06.583
The camp with the extras

11:06.583 --> 11:12.840
If you come to Bernie's,
You might think you're in Heaven!

11:59.887 --> 12:04.141
Here we have the winner, folks!
Have you ever seen a lovelier pair?

12:07.603 --> 12:11.440
What a shapely ankle!
What a perfect shin!

12:11.440 --> 12:16.653
If you could feel this silken thigh,
You'd know who has to win!

12:20.199 --> 12:26.455
If you could feel this silken thigh,
You'd know.

12:41.178 --> 12:46.058
You don't know how much I've missed

12:46.058 --> 12:51.271
To feel a man again,
To dance, to kiss.

12:59.613 --> 13:03.700
Your eyes reveal: You're lonely.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.828
This evening must pass slowly.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.957
Until we're one, my heart won't rest.

13:13.293 --> 13:17.339
Will Tommy share our happiness?

13:36.859 --> 13:41.113
I'll be more than an uncle;
I'll be just like a Dad!

13:42.281 --> 13:48.537
I will be a green coat too,
And when I'm big, I'll own a Holiday Camp!

13:48.620 --> 13:54.877
A camp with a difference,
Always be good weather.

13:56.670 --> 14:00.841
When you come to Tommy's,
The holiday's forever!

14:34.625 --> 14:40.881
I'm glad you like your Uncle Frank.
He'll surely love you too, just like a Dad

14:52.142 --> 14:58.398
He's very nice, I think.
Did he fight in the War?

15:33.851 --> 15:38.438
Gotta feeling '51 is gonna be a good year,

15:40.190 --> 15:45.612
Especially if you and me see it out together.

15:47.823 --> 15:51.451
So you think that '51 is gonna be a good year.

15:54.162 --> 15:58.041
We'll marry now and see it out together.

16:00.544 --> 16:05.549
I have no reason to be over-optimistic,

16:07.426 --> 16:13.682
But somehow when you smile
I can brave bad weather.

17:11.949 --> 17:17.579
What about the boy?
What about the boy?

17:18.121 --> 17:22.584
What about the boy, he saw it all!

17:23.210 --> 17:27.381
You didn't hear it, you didn't see it!
You won't say nothin' to no one,

17:27.714 --> 17:31.760
Ever in your life. You never heard it.
How absurd it all seems, without any proof

17:31.885 --> 17:35.931
You didn't hear it, you didn't see it!
You won't say nothin' to no one,

17:36.139 --> 17:39.268
Ever in your life.
You never heard it.

17:40.853 --> 17:45.858
How absurd it all seems, without any proof!

17:52.531 --> 17:57.119
You won't say nothin' to no one,
Never tell a soul what you know is the truth!

18:12.759 --> 18:15.053
Now he is deaf.
Now he is dumb

18:15.470 --> 18:19.308
Now he is blind.
The guilty are safe,

18:21.935 --> 18:25.063
But always accused by his empty eyes.

18:34.323 --> 18:38.493
Nothing to say, Nothing
to hear, And nothing to see

18:38.493 --> 18:43.707
Each sensation makes a note in his symphony.

18:47.669 --> 18:52.799
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go

18:52.799 --> 18:59.056
Come on the amazing journey,
And learn all you should know.

19:04.061 --> 19:09.983
A vague haze of delirium creeps up on him.
Soaring and flying images spin.

19:09.983 --> 19:16.240
He is your leader, he is your guide.
On the amazing journey,

20:04.329 --> 20:09.626
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

20:09.626 --> 20:14.840
Come on the amazing journey,
And learn all you should know

20:20.596 --> 20:26.518
His eyes are the eyes that transmit all he knows,
The truth burns so bright it can melt winter snows.

20:26.518 --> 20:30.689
A towering shadow, so black and so high,.

20:30.689 --> 20:34.860
A white sun burning the earth and the sky.

22:11.123 --> 22:17.379
Did you ever see the faces
Of the children, they get so excited

22:19.965 --> 22:26.013
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited

22:26.013 --> 22:31.977
They believe in dreams and all they mean,
Including Heaven's generosity.

22:33.020 --> 22:39.276
Peeping 'round the door to see what
Parcels are for free in curiosity.

22:48.327 --> 22:54.583
He doesn't know who Jesus was,
Or what praying is.

22:54.583 --> 23:00.839
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

23:22.653 --> 23:27.115
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?

23:57.145 --> 24:03.402
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.

24:31.972 --> 24:36.143
Surrounded by his friends,
He sits so silently and

24:36.143 --> 24:41.356
Unaware of anything.
Playing poxy pinball, picks his nose

24:41.356 --> 24:45.527
He smiles, he cries,
He pokes his tongue at everything

24:45.527 --> 24:46.570
I believe in love,

24:46.570 --> 24:52.826
But how can men who've never seen light
Be enlightened?

24:53.869 --> 25:00.125
Only if he's cured
Will his spirit's future level

25:00.125 --> 25:02.211
Ever heighten.

25:03.378 --> 25:05.964
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.

25:05.964 --> 25:12.221
He doesn't know who Jesus was,
Or what praying is.

25:13.680 --> 25:19.937
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?

26:37.306 --> 26:43.478
You talk about your woman,
I wish you could see mine.

26:54.823 --> 27:00.454
Everytime she starts to lovin',
She brings eyesight to the blind.

27:11.215 --> 27:17.471
You know, her daddy gave her magic.
I can tell by the way she walks.

27:26.021 --> 27:31.235
Everytime she starts to shake,
The dumb begin to talk,

28:15.654 --> 28:21.493
She's got the power to heal you,
Never fear.

28:30.878 --> 28:36.508
Just one word from her lips,
And the deaf can hear.

33:15.954 --> 33:21.460
If your child ain't all he should be now,
This girl will put him right.

33:21.460 --> 33:27.716
I'll show him what he could be now,
Just give me one night!

33:31.386 --> 33:37.643
I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen,
Pay me before I start.

33:37.726 --> 33:43.982
I'm the Gypsy, and I'm guaranteed
To mend his aching heart.

33:55.661 --> 34:01.208
Give us a room, close the door.
Leave us for a while.

34:01.208 --> 34:07.464
Your boy won't be a boy no more;
Young, but not a child!

34:07.464 --> 34:13.719
'Cause I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen,
Pay me before I start.

34:13.719 --> 34:19.976
The Gypsy, and I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.547
Gather your wits and hold on fast,
Your mind must learn to roam.

34:48.547 --> 34:54.803
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do,
You're gonna hit the road!

36:34.570 --> 36:40.117
My work is done, now look at him.
He's never been more alive.

36:40.117 --> 36:46.373
His head it shakes, his fingers clutch.
Watch his body writhe!

41:37.080 --> 41:43.337
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Cousin Kevin?

41:43.754 --> 41:48.967
There's something 'bout him I
Don't really like.

41:54.890 --> 42:00.729
I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright.

42:10.447 --> 42:16.703
We're on our own, cousin.
All alone, cousin.

42:16.703 --> 42:22.960
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away

42:22.960 --> 42:29.216
You won't be much fun,
Being blind, deaf and dumb,

42:29.216 --> 42:35.472
But I've no one to play with today.
Do you know how to play Hide and Seek?

42:35.472 --> 42:40.686
To find me, it would take you a week!

42:40.686 --> 42:45.899
You won't go anywhere.
There's a lot I can do to a freak!

42:45.899 --> 42:52.155
How would you feel if I turned on the bath,
Ducked your head under and started to laugh?

42:55.284 --> 43:01.540
Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Will change your expression to one of alarm.

43:17.264 --> 43:23.520
I'm the school bully,
The classroom cheat,

43:24.146 --> 43:30.402
The nastiest play-friend
You ever could meet.

43:31.445 --> 43:37.701
I'll put glass in your dinner,
and spikes in your seat.

43:42.915 --> 43:49.171
I'll drag you around
By a lock of your hair,

43:49.379 --> 43:55.636
And give you a push
At the top of the stair!

43:55.636 --> 44:01.892
What would you do if I
Shut you outside

44:02.935 --> 44:09.191
To stand in the rain and
Catch cold, so you'd die?

44:12.319 --> 44:18.575
I'm the school bully,
The classroom cheat,

44:18.575 --> 44:24.831
The nastiest play-friend
You ever could meet.

44:25.874 --> 44:32.130
I'll stick pins in your fingers,
And tread on your feet.

44:38.804 --> 44:44.977
We're on our own, cousin.
All alone, cousin.

44:44.977 --> 44:51.233
We've thought of some nice games to play
While the grownups has all gone away.

44:52.276 --> 44:58.532
You weren't too much fun,
'Cause you're blind, deaf and dumb,

44:59.867 --> 45:01.660
But I'd no one to play with today.

45:53.378 --> 45:59.635
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie?

45:59.718 --> 46:05.974
Do you think it's alright?
He's had a few too many tonight

46:10.145 --> 46:15.067
Yes, I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright.

46:39.883 --> 46:44.471
I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie;
I'm glad you won't see or hear me,

46:44.471 --> 46:49.685
As I fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about.

46:49.685 --> 46:55.941
Your mother left me here to mind you,
And I'm doing exactly what I bleedin' well want to,

47:05.200 --> 47:09.997
Down with your bedclothes,
Up with your nightshirt.

47:09.997 --> 47:16.253
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about.

47:17.296 --> 47:23.552
You won't "shite"
As I fiddle "abite. "

49:04.611 --> 49:10.659
Do you think it's alright
Leaving Tommy by the mirror?

49:10.659 --> 49:16.915
You would think he had sight,
Been staring half the night.

49:21.086 --> 49:25.549
Yes, I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright

53:36.341 --> 53:41.763
Extra, extra, pinball bonanza!
Deaf dumb and blind kid makes the big game!

53:41.763 --> 53:46.977
Saturday, the final, he faces the champ!
Extra, extra, extra!

53:46.977 --> 53:53.233
Pinball, the big time, a million in hand!
You can rule the world from a yacht in the bay!

53:53.233 --> 53:57.404
Champagne flowing, you're popular, man!
Pinball, let's play!

53:57.487 --> 54:00.407
Tommy keeps on winning,
He's a millionaire,

54:00.407 --> 54:04.578
Momma's got a brand new Cadillac.
Hurry to the show,

54:04.578 --> 54:07.706
We're nearly on the air!
Extra, extra!

54:42.324 --> 54:45.035
Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.

54:45.035 --> 54:48.163
From SoHo down to Brighton,
I must have played them all.

54:48.163 --> 54:51.291
But I ain't seen nothin' like him
In any amusement hall.

54:51.291 --> 54:56.505
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

55:04.346 --> 55:07.349
He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.

55:07.349 --> 55:10.477
Feelin' all the bumpers,
Always playin' clean.

55:10.477 --> 55:14.648
He plays by intuition.
The digit counters fall.

55:14.648 --> 55:18.819
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

55:26.118 --> 55:29.371
He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.

55:29.371 --> 55:32.499
A pinball wizard,

55:32.499 --> 55:36.670
Got such a supple wrist!

55:37.921 --> 55:39.798
How do you think he does it?

55:39.798 --> 55:40.841
I don't know!

55:40.841 --> 55:42.384
What makes him so good?

55:44.887 --> 55:48.140
Well, he ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.

55:48.140 --> 55:51.268
Don't see lights a-flashing,
He plays by sense of smell.

55:51.268 --> 55:54.396
Always has a replay,
Never tilts at all,

55:54.396 --> 55:59.610
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

56:07.201 --> 56:10.329
He can't beat me now,
I've always been the champ!

56:10.329 --> 56:14.499
I know it's a trick!
No freak's gonna beat my hand!

56:40.275 --> 56:43.695
He can beat my favorite table,
He can beat the best.

56:43.695 --> 56:46.823
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

56:46.823 --> 56:49.952
He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I've never seen them fall.

56:49.952 --> 56:55.165
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

57:10.180 --> 57:13.517
He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist.

57:13.517 --> 57:16.645
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist!

57:24.695 --> 57:28.115
He's a pinball wizard
His score shoots even more

57:28.115 --> 57:33.328
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord!

57:36.999 --> 57:41.170
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more

58:12.451 --> 58:18.707
thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.

01:00:24.041 --> 01:00:30.297
It rains champagne!
A son was born again!

01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:36.845
A genius untamed!
A life of wealth and fame, wealth and fame!

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:51.026
Champagne flowing down just like rain,
Caviar breakfasts every day.

01:00:52.194 --> 01:00:58.450
Merchant banks and yachts and...
Servants and cars and private sand.

01:01:00.536 --> 01:01:06.792
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.

01:01:38.991 --> 01:01:45.247
They flock in, thousands strong.
We'll just play along.

01:01:45.581 --> 01:01:51.837
A million in reserve.
For love, a just deserve, just deserve!

01:01:59.636 --> 01:02:05.893
Birds and flowers and peacock's wings,
Sequined gowns and birds that sing!

01:02:06.727 --> 01:02:12.983
Private planes and fishing lanes.
Bigger crowds and bigger, bigger, bigger takes.

01:02:17.154 --> 01:02:22.367
But what's it all worth?

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:36.548
What's it all worth when my son is blind?
He can't hear the music nor enjoy what I'm buying.

01:02:37.174 --> 01:02:43.430
His life is worthless, affecting mine.
I'd pay any price to drive his plight from my mind!

01:06:21.148 --> 01:06:25.527
There's a man I've found
Could bring us all joy!

01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:30.449
There's a doctor I've found can cure the boy!
A doctor I've found can cure the boy!

01:06:30.449 --> 01:06:35.329
There's a man I've found could remove his sorrow,
He lives in this town, let's see him tomorrow,

01:07:01.813 --> 01:07:08.070
He seems to be completely unreceptive.
The tests I gave him showed no sense at all.

01:07:09.446 --> 01:07:15.702
His eyes react to light; the dials detect it.
He hears but cannot answer to your call.

01:07:57.828 --> 01:08:04.084
There is no chance, no untried operation.
All hope lies with him and none with me.

01:08:05.335 --> 01:08:11.592
Imagine though the shock from isolation,
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see.

01:08:58.095 --> 01:09:02.059
His eyes can see,
His ears can hear, his lips speak.

01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:06.229
All the time the needles flick and rock.

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:12.486
No machine can give the kind of stimulation,
Needed to remove his inner block.

01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:27.709
I often wonder what it is he's feeling.
Has he ever heard a word I've said?

01:09:29.461 --> 01:09:35.716
Look at him, now in the mirror dreaming.
What is happening in his head?

01:09:44.059 --> 01:09:50.314
What is happening in his head?
Oooooh, I wish I knew, I wish I knew.

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:37.237
Tommy, can you see me?
Can I help to cheer you?

01:10:37.237 --> 01:10:42.451
Tommy, can you hear me?
Can you feel me near you?

01:10:42.451 --> 01:10:48.707
Oooh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

01:11:53.897 --> 01:11:58.151
You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a twitch

01:11:58.151 --> 01:12:02.322
But you gaze at your own reflection!

01:12:02.322 --> 01:12:06.493
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself.

01:12:06.493 --> 01:12:11.707
How can the mirror affect you?

01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:17.880
Can you hear me
Or do I surmise

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.050
That you fear me can you feel my temper

01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:28.307
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise,

01:12:37.482 --> 01:12:42.905
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror?

01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:31.286
I'm free - I'm free,

01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:41.505
And freedom tastes of reality!

01:13:43.173 --> 01:13:48.595
I'm free - I'm free,

01:13:50.973 --> 01:13:55.978
And I'm waiting for you to follow me.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:01.316
If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high

01:14:01.316 --> 01:14:05.487
You'd laugh and say "Nothing's that simple. "

01:14:05.487 --> 01:14:07.573
But you've been told many times before

01:14:07.573 --> 01:14:09.658
Messiahs pointed to the door

01:14:09.658 --> 01:14:14.872
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!

01:14:33.015 --> 01:14:38.854
I'm free - I'm free

01:14:40.939 --> 01:14:46.028
And I'm waiting for you to follow me.

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:58.934
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?

01:16:53.572 --> 01:16:59.828
Mother, Father.
Touch me, feel me.

01:17:02.331 --> 01:17:04.708
Who am I, where did I come from?

01:17:04.708 --> 01:17:08.879
Have you known me, have you seen me?

01:17:10.756 --> 01:17:15.469
You're a hero! You are famous!
You're a champion of the young!

01:17:15.469 --> 01:17:20.682
You are rich, but it's so absurd to try
To explain all the things you've done.

01:17:20.682 --> 01:17:26.939
You're a god, and you're loved;
Thousands watch you play

01:17:27.231 --> 01:17:32.778
Pinball! It's a fever!
And you're the master of the game!

01:17:32.861 --> 01:17:39.117
And now that you're whole,
You'll be champion of their very souls.

01:17:44.039 --> 01:17:48.293
Yes, I'm healed!
Delivered from silent darkness.

01:17:48.293 --> 01:17:53.507
No more locked doors
Or stifled screams.

01:17:53.507 --> 01:17:59.763
Pinball! What I see now before me

01:18:01.223 --> 01:18:06.979
Is far beyond the game,
Beyond your wildest dreams!

01:18:12.693 --> 01:18:17.823
Those who love me
Have a higher path to follow now

01:18:18.949 --> 01:18:23.537
And you, dear mother, too
Must be prepared!

01:19:17.049 --> 01:19:22.888
Extra, extra, read all about it!
Pinball Wizard in a miracle cure!

01:19:22.888 --> 01:19:27.059
Extra, extra, read all about it!
Extra, Extra!

01:19:28.727 --> 01:19:33.398
Right now, right now, story and pictures
Pinball bonanza, a mother's joy!

01:19:33.398 --> 01:19:36.527
...to show times, lessons and actors.

01:19:54.878 --> 01:19:59.466
Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting.

01:19:59.466 --> 01:20:04.680
He went on cleaning his black Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping.

01:20:07.516 --> 01:20:12.813
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah.

01:20:13.438 --> 01:20:18.652
She picked up a book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire!

01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:23.782
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart

01:20:23.782 --> 01:20:26.910
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,

01:20:29.705 --> 01:20:34.209
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...

01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:37.337
Is to be what you'll be. "

01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:51.101
The theme of the sermon was come unto me,
Love will find a way,

01:20:51.101 --> 01:20:56.315
So Sally decided to ignore her dad,
And sneak out anyway!

01:20:56.315 --> 01:21:01.528
She spent all afternoon getting ready,
Decided she'd try to touch him,

01:21:01.528 --> 01:21:06.742
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday.

01:21:12.372 --> 01:21:14.750
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:17.878
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,

01:21:21.757 --> 01:21:23.717
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...

01:21:23.717 --> 01:21:25.802
Is to be what you'll be. "

01:21:39.983 --> 01:21:45.113
She arrived at six and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine.

01:21:45.113 --> 01:21:50.327
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying.

01:21:50.327 --> 01:21:55.541
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row

01:21:55.541 --> 01:22:00.754
And then one of the people came on stage
And shouted, "Here we go!"

01:22:03.674 --> 01:22:08.679
The crowd went crazy as Tommy hit the stage!

01:22:08.679 --> 01:22:14.935
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage!

01:22:18.689 --> 01:22:22.317
Your happy welcome is like a favor
I must now return.

01:22:23.902 --> 01:22:28.782
The darkness of my childhood past
And flames of blood now burn.

01:22:28.782 --> 01:22:33.996
The pinball game I play so well
Reflects a way of life.

01:22:34.204 --> 01:22:39.543
This meeting is just another game;
Let's play to win, tonight!

01:22:42.129 --> 01:22:44.423
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart

01:22:44.423 --> 01:22:47.551
That she and Tommy were worlds apart

01:22:51.305 --> 01:22:53.182
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...

01:22:53.182 --> 01:22:55.267
Is to be what you'll be. "

01:23:06.737 --> 01:23:11.867
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down,
Mingling with her tears.

01:23:11.867 --> 01:23:17.080
Try to walk the path I walked,
Never mind the pain and fear.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:22.294
Each one of you has freedom
In your heart without my grace.

01:23:22.294 --> 01:23:28.550
Let me see you raise your hands
See joy upon your face!

01:23:30.636 --> 01:23:35.516
The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage!

01:23:35.516 --> 01:23:40.729
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch

01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:44.900
And a gash across her face,
her pretty face! Ooooh.

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:48.028
Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said,

01:23:48.028 --> 01:23:50.656
"Don't say I didn't warn yer. "

01:23:50.656 --> 01:23:56.912
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California.

01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:05.546
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild!

01:24:05.546 --> 01:24:11.802
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile.

01:25:16.033 --> 01:25:19.369
While Tommy flies, the world is turning.

01:25:19.369 --> 01:25:23.540
Life goes on for you and me

01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:28.754
Our chief concern is money earning,

01:25:28.754 --> 01:25:33.967
Why can't someone set us free?

01:25:39.097 --> 01:25:45.354
Can't you feel him?
Can't you feel him?

01:27:01.263 --> 01:27:07.102
You'll feel me coming
A new vibration

01:27:07.102 --> 01:27:13.358
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:30.876
I overwhelm as I approach you
Make your lungs hold breath inside!

01:27:33.879 --> 01:27:40.135
Lovers break caresses for me
Love enhanced when I've gone by.

01:27:52.147 --> 01:27:58.403
They worship me and all I touch
Hazy eyed they catch my glance,

01:28:01.406 --> 01:28:07.663
Pleasant shudders shake their senses
My warm momentum throws their stance.

01:28:13.001 --> 01:28:18.841
You'll feel me coming
A new vibration

01:28:18.841 --> 01:28:24.054
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.

01:28:29.476 --> 01:28:34.565
Soon you'll see me can't you feel me
I'm coming...

01:28:35.732 --> 01:28:40.737
Send your troubles dancing I know the answer
I'm coming...

01:28:45.951 --> 01:28:48.453
I'm a sensation.

01:29:09.183 --> 01:29:15.439
I leave a trail of rooted people
Mesmerised by just the sight,

01:29:18.275 --> 01:29:24.531
The few I touched now are disciples
Love as One I Am the Light...

01:29:47.888 --> 01:29:54.144
Come to my house,
Be one of the comfortable people.

01:29:57.481 --> 01:30:02.778
Come to this house, We're
drinking all night, Never sleeping.

01:30:07.282 --> 01:30:10.911
Milkman come in!
And you, baker,

01:30:11.245 --> 01:30:15.707
Little old lady, welcome,
And you, shoemaker.

01:30:17.793 --> 01:30:24.049
Come to this house,
Into this house!

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:33.976
Come to this house,
Be one of us.

01:30:37.396 --> 01:30:43.569
Make this your house,
Be one of us.

01:30:47.114 --> 01:30:50.742
You can help
To collect some more in.

01:30:50.742 --> 01:30:54.913
Young and old people,
Let's get them all in.

01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:12.973
Ask along that man with a big red carnation

01:31:12.973 --> 01:31:16.101
Bring every single person
From Victoria Station.

01:31:16.101 --> 01:31:22.357
Go into that hospital,
And bring the nurses and patients.

01:31:22.357 --> 01:31:27.571
Everybody go home and fetch their relations.

01:31:28.405 --> 01:31:33.827
Come to this house,
Be one of the comfortable people.

01:31:37.789 --> 01:31:43.921
Lovely bright home,
We're drinking all night never sleeping.

01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:50.594
Hullo, Tommy, there's more at the door.

01:31:54.056 --> 01:31:58.310
There's more at the door.
There's more at the door.

01:32:09.154 --> 01:32:13.325
We need more room,
Build an extension.

01:32:13.325 --> 01:32:18.539
A colorful palace,
Spare no expense, now!

01:32:28.257 --> 01:32:34.513
Come to me now!
Come to me now!

01:33:10.048 --> 01:33:16.305
To raise your weary spirits high,
My son will teach your silent hearts

01:33:17.973 --> 01:33:21.101
To talk!

01:33:25.397 --> 01:33:31.653
Every home will have his picture.
Pilgrims all will touch his hand.

01:33:34.031 --> 01:33:40.287
Pinball tables, gold and silver,
Altars to the Master's plan!

01:33:44.875 --> 01:33:51.131
Rio, Paris, New York, London.
Moscow, Peking, Tokyo, the world

01:34:00.933 --> 01:34:07.189
A Tommy Camp in every city,
Millions flocking in like sheep.

01:34:07.523 --> 01:34:13.779
What they want ain't cheap, 's a pity.
But who am I to upset their dreams?

01:37:22.301 --> 01:37:27.389
These pricy gips don't teach us!
Your freedom doesn't reach us!

01:37:28.849 --> 01:37:35.022
Enlightenment escapes us!
Awareness doesn't shape us!

01:37:35.731 --> 01:37:41.069
How can all this trvia
Take us to the goal you reached?

01:37:42.946 --> 01:37:48.785
We came here to be like you,
To find the world you've reached

01:37:50.954 --> 01:37:57.211
These pricy gips don't teach us!
Your freedom doesn't reach us!

01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:12.017
How can all this trvia
Take us to the goal you reached?

01:38:12.559 --> 01:38:18.607
We came here to be like you,
To find the world you've reached!

01:38:27.366 --> 01:38:32.996
Welcome to the camp!
I guess you all know why we're here.

01:38:34.122 --> 01:38:39.962
My name is Tommy, and I became aware this year.

01:38:39.962 --> 01:38:46.218
If you want to follow me,
You've got to play pinball.

01:38:46.218 --> 01:38:52.474
So put in your earplugs,
Put on your eyeshades,

01:38:52.474 --> 01:38:57.688
You know where to put the cork!

01:38:59.690 --> 01:39:04.903
Hey you, gettin' drunk,
So sorry, I've got you sussed.

01:39:04.903 --> 01:39:11.159
Hey, you, smokin' mother nature,
You missed the bus.

01:39:11.159 --> 01:39:17.416
Hey, hung up old Mister Normal,
Don't try to gain my trust.

01:39:18.458 --> 01:39:23.672
'Cos you ain't gonna follow me
Any of those ways,

01:39:23.672 --> 01:39:26.800
Although you think you must!

01:39:37.644 --> 01:39:43.275
Now you can't hear me,
Your ears are truly sealed!

01:39:45.027 --> 01:39:50.449
You can't speak either,
'Cos your mouth is filled

01:39:50.449 --> 01:39:56.705
You can't see nothing,
And pinball completes the scene.

01:39:58.081 --> 01:39:59.750
Here come willing helpers

01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:02.878
To guide you to
Your very own machine!

01:40:50.092 --> 01:40:53.971
We're not gonna take it.
We're not gonna take it.

01:41:03.146 --> 01:41:07.818
We're not gonna take it,
Never did and never will,

01:41:09.194 --> 01:41:11.572
We don't have to take it.

01:41:11.905 --> 01:41:15.242
Gonna break it!
Gonna shake it!

01:41:15.242 --> 01:41:17.327
Let's forget it better still!

01:42:01.413 --> 01:42:07.669
Don't want no religion,
As far as we can tell!

01:42:08.086 --> 01:42:13.300
We ain't gonna take you,
Never did and never will!

01:42:19.473 --> 01:42:23.310
We forsake you,
Gonna rape you,

01:42:23.644 --> 01:42:29.900
Let's forget you better still!

01:45:14.857 --> 01:45:21.113
Listening to you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat.

01:45:22.865 --> 01:45:29.121
Following you I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!

01:45:33.208 --> 01:45:39.464
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.

01:45:41.633 --> 01:45:47.890
From you I get opinions.
From you I get the story.

01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:03.655
Listening to you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat.

01:46:04.072 --> 01:46:10.329
Following you I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!

01:46:14.166 --> 01:46:20.422
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.

01:46:23.342 --> 01:46:29.598
From you I get opinions.
From you I get the story.

01:46:55.791 --> 01:47:02.047
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.
