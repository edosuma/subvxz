<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.003 --> 00:05.995
- Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?

00:06.172 --> 00:08.572
Petrova doppelganger,
key to breaking the curse.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.006
- Sun and moon curse?
- Curse placed on Klaus.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.576
What does that make Klaus?

00:12.746 --> 00:14.873
- A werewolf or a vampire?
- He's both.

00:15.048 --> 00:17.915
Your mom used to tell me stories
about vampires.

00:18.084 --> 00:19.915
I never thought that could be true.

00:20.086 --> 00:22.953
- What is Klaus' curse?
- Witches, servants of nature...

00:23.156 --> 00:26.956
...saw to it that my brother's
werewolf side would become dormant.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.788
He wants to trigger that part of him
that's a werewolf.

00:29.963 --> 00:32.022
- Klaus can't be killed?
- Curse must be broken.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.690
When Klaus is in transition, that's when
he'll be at his most vulnerable.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.531
Bonnie will be able to kill Klaus
without hurting herself.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.572
- Elijah knows how to save my life.
- You can all go to hell.

00:56.689 --> 00:58.816
<i>Tonight is a full moon.</i>

00:58.992 --> 01:02.393
<i>We should assume that Klaus</i>
<i>is prepared to break the curse.</i>

01:03.396 --> 01:05.660
Elena said
that the sun and moon curse is fake.

01:05.832 --> 01:08.130
That it's actually just a curse
placed on Klaus.

01:08.301 --> 01:10.428
Klaus is vampire
born of a werewolf bloodline.

01:10.603 --> 01:13.265
The curse has kept his werewolf aspect
from manifesting.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.739
But if he breaks it,
he'll be a true hybrid.

01:19.979 --> 01:22.413
Then why are we letting him
break the curse?

01:23.016 --> 01:24.574
We can kill him today.

01:25.151 --> 01:26.641
- With Bonnie.
- Damon.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.482
No. Bonnie can't use that much power
without dying.

01:29.656 --> 01:32.750
- I'll write her a great eulogy.
- It's not an option, Damon.

01:33.993 --> 01:36.962
All right, how do we break this curse?

01:37.130 --> 01:38.961
The ritual itself is straightforward.

01:39.132 --> 01:42.124
The ingredients, so to speak,
you already know.

01:42.869 --> 01:43.995
The moonstone.

01:44.471 --> 01:48.134
<i>A witch will channel the power</i>
<i>of the full moon...</i>

01:48.308 --> 01:51.038
<i>...to release the spell</i>
<i>that's bound within the stone.</i>

01:51.244 --> 01:54.873
<i>After that, Klaus,</i>
<i>being both werewolf and vampire...</i>

01:55.048 --> 01:57.346
<i>...will sacrifice one of each.</i>

01:57.750 --> 01:59.149
And where do I fit into it?

01:59.319 --> 02:01.787
The final part of the ritual.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.891
Klaus must drink the blood
of the doppelganger...

02:08.161 --> 02:10.526
...to the point of your death.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.262
And that's where you come in.

02:17.570 --> 02:21.563
This is an elixir that I acquired
some 500 years ago for Katerina.

02:21.774 --> 02:26.871
It possesses mystical properties
of resuscitation.

02:27.046 --> 02:29.344
- So I'll be dead?
- And then you won't.

02:30.216 --> 02:31.410
That's your plan?

02:31.584 --> 02:34.712
A magical witch potion
with no expiration date?

02:34.888 --> 02:37.186
You wanna come back to life,
what about John's ring?

02:37.724 --> 02:39.248
Those rings only work on humans.

02:39.425 --> 02:41.518
A doppelganger
is a supernatural occurrence.

02:41.694 --> 02:43.753
Odds are the ring won't work.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.728
I'd take those odds over your elixir.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.058
What if it doesn't work, Elena?

02:50.036 --> 02:51.663
Then I guess I'll just be dead.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.705
Wha...?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.778
Do we know if Klaus
has everything he needs to do this?

03:06.953 --> 03:08.113
Does he have a werewolf?

03:08.321 --> 03:11.882
Klaus has been waiting
to break this curse for over 1000 years.

03:12.058 --> 03:16.017
If he doesn't already have a werewolf,
my guess is by tonight, he will.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.596
Tyler, honey. It's your mother.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.599
I don't know where you are,
but I need you.

03:22.769 --> 03:26.136
I've had an accident
and I'm in the hospital.

03:28.408 --> 03:30.535
Please, Tyler.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.037
Come home.

03:35.348 --> 03:38.875
- Why did I say that?
- Because you had a terrible fall.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.167
Breakfast of champions, huh?

03:59.372 --> 04:01.738
Surrounded by idiots,
need all the help I can get.

04:01.908 --> 04:05.275
- You know, you're not helping.
- Elijah's an Original, Stefan.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.777
One we tried to kill.
You gonna believe this guy?

04:07.947 --> 04:09.608
What do you want me to do, Damon?

04:09.782 --> 04:13.513
Elena made her decision.
She's choosing to trust Elijah.

04:13.686 --> 04:14.846
I put my faith in her.

04:15.021 --> 04:18.149
- Why? She's gonna end up dead.
- Because she put her faith in me.

04:18.324 --> 04:20.349
She chose to trust me
in spite of what I am.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.824
If I bet on somebody's instincts,
it's hers.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.521
Then that makes you the biggest idiot
of them all.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.432
She chose to trust you too.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.399
Then maybe you shouldn't be so sure
about her instincts.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.110
You'd think he'd understand
why I'm willing to do this.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.115
Why are you?

04:47.487 --> 04:50.012
I'm the key to breaking the curse.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.055
Klaus is here because of me.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.819
If I don't stop him,
then he's gonna hurt people.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.621
It's that simple.

04:56.796 --> 05:00.061
You know there is a possibility
this elixir won't work.

05:00.633 --> 05:01.964
I don't want to mislead you.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.434
I know the chance I'm taking.

05:07.006 --> 05:09.133
- Get out.
- Jenna. Jenna.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.936
Get out.

05:12.178 --> 05:13.873
Jenna, put the crossbow down, okay?

05:14.047 --> 05:15.207
- It's me.
- Stay away.

05:15.381 --> 05:17.849
- What's going on?
- It's me, Elena. I swear, okay.

05:18.017 --> 05:20.679
- He let me go. Klaus let me go.
- Prove it.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.813
Okay. Uh, the first night you and I
spent together, Jeremy walked in...

05:24.991 --> 05:26.356
Okay, it's him.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.830
- Why did he let you go?
- He wanted me to deliver a message.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.836
Sacrifice happens tonight.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.682
Tyler.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.288
Mom.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.692
You're back.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.762
I'm back.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.843
- Jeez.
- Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

06:22.014 --> 06:23.982
It's okay. I didn't know you were here.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.448
Wanted to catch you on break,
we can hang out.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.280
- I have lunch in an hour.
- Perfect.

06:28.454 --> 06:32.083
I will go run some errands
and I will be right back.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.254
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.966
- Does she suspect anything?
- No. But I can't do this anymore.

06:50.143 --> 06:54.102
I've been with her the past few days and
I'm putting on the best show of my life.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.805
Either she is too,
or she's still the same Caroline.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.281
She's not the same. She's a vampire.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.113
I don't even know what that means.

07:01.287 --> 07:03.585
Look, I know this is hard
to understand...

07:03.756 --> 07:06.691
...but my family,
we were raised with this.

07:06.859 --> 07:10.590
They're monsters, Matt.
They have no soul, no humanity.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.788
There's nothing
that makes me believe that.

07:12.965 --> 07:16.867
It's an act. I believed Damon Salvatore
was my closest ally in this town.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.366
Instead, he's a killer.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.604
They killed your sister.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.141
What other proof do you need?

07:26.312 --> 07:28.644
I could ask you the same question,
sheriff.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.375
Why haven't you done anything?
Why are you hesitating?

07:31.584 --> 07:33.950
Because I need more information.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.947
And because in spite
of everything I just said...

07:39.125 --> 07:42.993
...I still look at her
and I see my daughter.

07:43.396 --> 07:47.856
Damon is the problem, not Caroline.
We should focus on him.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.592
I shouldn't have involved you.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.706
Thank you for all of your help,
but I'll take it from here.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.638
So you don't remember anything
that happened?

08:00.813 --> 08:04.681
No. It's like I blacked out,
and woke up three days later.

08:05.852 --> 08:06.876
Katherine was there.

08:07.053 --> 08:09.544
She's under compulsion.
Damon snuck her some vervain.

08:09.722 --> 08:11.815
Can't leave till Klaus tells her she can.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.391
- Where is Damon?
- I saw him go upstairs.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.556
So, what else did I do?

08:26.772 --> 08:29.400
- You disappeared.
- Didn't wanna hear any more.

08:29.575 --> 08:32.601
I need you to understand
why I'm doing this.

08:32.778 --> 08:35.905
Why? It clearly doesn't matter
what I think.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.379
I'll be fine, Damon.

08:37.549 --> 08:41.679
I'll drink the elixir,
Bonnie will kill Klaus...

08:41.854 --> 08:44.448
...and then all this will finally be over.

08:44.657 --> 08:46.522
- Lf it works.
- It will work.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.786
You think it will work.
You want it to work.

08:49.962 --> 08:52.260
Why am I the only one
who's convinced it won't?

08:52.431 --> 08:55.559
- There has to be another way.
- There isn't.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.600
- And you're gonna die, Elena.
- And then I'll come back to life.

08:59.772 --> 09:03.572
- That is not a risk I'm willing to take.
- But I am.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.771
It's my life, Damon.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.441
My choice.

09:15.821 --> 09:17.812
I can't lose you.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.387
You won't.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.172
There is another way.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.210
What are you...?

09:42.014 --> 09:44.574
Damon, no. Damon, no...

09:57.697 --> 10:01.531
- What did you do? Huh? What did you do?
- I saved her life.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.530
You're bent on dying,
this way I know you'll come back.

10:05.905 --> 10:07.270
As a vampire.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.170
- She'll come back a vampire.
- It's better than nothing.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.334
How could you take that choice
away from her?

10:15.781 --> 10:18.375
Go ahead,
wish me an eternity of misery.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.212
Believe me, you'll get over it.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.118
Stefan.

10:26.092 --> 10:29.823
Admit it. You just wish you had the balls
to do it yourself.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.268
- Damon, no!
- Unh.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.144
Go, get out of here.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.640
- What the hell is going on?
- Get him out of here.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.342
- Oh, my God.
- Eh...

11:00.826 --> 11:03.317
Okay, Jenna,
in the basement are some blood bags.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.828
Go get them now. Go.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.700
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

11:14.907 --> 11:16.306
Unh, I'm so sorry. Ugh.

11:16.475 --> 11:20.571
- Shh, shh. It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.976
Sounds like
you won't be needing this anymore.

11:26.152 --> 11:29.588
Feeding her vampire blood
rendered it useless.

11:30.222 --> 11:33.487
Tell Elena I'll be back before nightfall.
We'll proceed as planned.

11:33.659 --> 11:36.594
We both know that elixir
wouldn't have worked, anyway.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.961
Your problem, Damon...

11:40.299 --> 11:45.032
...you talk a good game,
but you don't actually know anything.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.232
She'll never forgive you.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.667
And never for a vampire...

11:53.312 --> 11:55.644
...it's a very long time.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.355
Thank you.

12:11.397 --> 12:15.197
- Both of you.
- Yeah. Well, we'll be downstairs.

12:18.437 --> 12:23.932
- I know it's, uh... It's a lot to take in.
- Yeah.

12:24.510 --> 12:28.344
I tried to protect you from all this, but I
should've known you could handle it.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.548
- Can I?
- Well, you just did.

12:33.652 --> 12:37.281
Jenna, I know we have a lot
to talk about.

12:40.659 --> 12:42.058
I'm glad you're okay.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.425
I should have said that already.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.703
How could he do that to me? Why?

13:04.717 --> 13:07.117
We've never talked about this.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.683
What this all means.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.722
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it matters.

13:12.892 --> 13:15.122
Hey, it matters.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.788
I want you to go somewhere with me.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.162
- Stefan, I can't.
- No, no, it's not far, okay?

13:23.335 --> 13:26.896
It's just for the day. I promise.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.293
- What are you doing here?
- I should be asking that.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.586
I told you not to come.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.788
She's my mother. I had to.

13:53.465 --> 13:57.799
Now we have to get out of here.
Lock ourselves up before tonight.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.636
Tyler?

14:06.946 --> 14:08.743
Jules.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.948
- I'll give you a few minutes.
- Thank you.

14:13.118 --> 14:16.315
- Just a few, Tyler.
- I got it.

14:23.162 --> 14:25.062
She's just making sure I'm safe.

14:25.464 --> 14:26.954
So, what are you...?

14:27.132 --> 14:29.066
You two are, like, friends now?

14:29.668 --> 14:30.828
She's been helping me.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.032
How are you?

14:35.174 --> 14:36.402
I heard about your mom.

14:36.575 --> 14:38.406
I just came to check in on her.

14:38.577 --> 14:42.536
She's banged up, but she'll be okay.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.710
And you? Um...

14:46.685 --> 14:48.676
How is everything with you?

14:49.021 --> 14:50.488
I'm hanging in there.

14:52.091 --> 14:55.356
- Good.
- Yeah.

14:59.164 --> 15:02.190
I should get going.
Jules and I need to get on the road.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.199
You're leaving again?

15:06.672 --> 15:08.867
I left for a reason, Caroline.

15:09.041 --> 15:12.010
Your explanation must have got lost
in the mail.

15:12.177 --> 15:13.405
Along with your goodbye.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.012
Well...

15:20.819 --> 15:22.844
Take care of yourself.

15:26.558 --> 15:27.616
Tyler...

15:43.108 --> 15:44.370
Let's go.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.777
Hey, Caroline, it's me.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.382
I thought you were coming back
to meet me.

15:51.850 --> 15:54.045
Look, I need to talk to you.
It's important.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.756
Thanks.

16:03.862 --> 16:05.295
I'll have the same.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.894
I screwed up.

16:11.437 --> 16:14.235
- Yeah. Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.169
Gentlemen.

16:16.942 --> 16:18.000
Why so glum?

16:25.651 --> 16:28.848
- Klaus, I presume.
- In the flesh.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.784
Thanks for the loaner, mate.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.960
Any reason you stopped by to say hi?

16:35.127 --> 16:37.618
I'm told you and your brother
fancy my doppelganger.

16:38.397 --> 16:41.423
Just thought I'd remind you
not to try anything you'll regret.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.498
Thanks for the advice.

16:49.675 --> 16:53.270
I don't suppose I could talk you
into a postponement...

16:53.445 --> 16:55.140
...by any chance, huh?

16:55.848 --> 16:57.679
You are kidding.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.010
He's kidding, right?

16:59.184 --> 17:00.446
No. Not really.

17:00.619 --> 17:03.383
I mean, what's one month
in the grand scheme of things?

17:03.555 --> 17:05.819
Let me be clear.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.355
I have my vampire.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.050
I have my werewolf.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.288
I have everything I need.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.159
The ritual will happen tonight.

17:14.867 --> 17:20.737
So if you want to live to see tomorrow,
don't screw it up.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.246
- That was fun.
- You're gonna screw it up, aren't you?

17:33.452 --> 17:37.320
You think if I took his werewolf out,
she might get over the fact...

17:37.489 --> 17:41.220
...I tried to turn her into a vampire?
- It won't matter because you'll be dead.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.055
But without the werewolf,
he can't perform the ritual...

17:44.229 --> 17:46.390
...means I would have bought her
one month.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.396
And you'll still be dead.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.703
You gonna help me or what?

17:55.607 --> 17:57.666
What do you want me to do?

18:03.715 --> 18:05.615
Where are we?

18:05.784 --> 18:07.217
It's a surprise.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.649
Just a little bit longer.

18:09.822 --> 18:14.623
I'm not a vampire yet, you know.
My legs still get tired.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.057
Ready to talk about how you're feeling
about all of this?

18:17.229 --> 18:19.026
Uh, heh.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.826
This morning I was wondering
if I would live or die.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.525
And now I'm gonna be a vampire.

18:24.703 --> 18:29.640
I don't really know how I'm feeling.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.380
My God. This is beautiful.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.387
I think you do know how you feel.

18:45.524 --> 18:48.823
I just want you to know
that it's okay to tell me.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.525
I can't.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.559
Stefan, I just...

18:54.333 --> 18:56.324
I can't talk about it.

18:56.502 --> 18:59.096
Well, if you don't want to,
it's your choice.

18:59.271 --> 19:00.499
Today is about you.

19:02.274 --> 19:03.832
But...

19:04.543 --> 19:06.602
...it's a long way to the top.

19:06.778 --> 19:10.214
Let's go.
You never know what might come up.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.977
- We're climbing all the way to the top?
- Oh, yeah.

19:14.253 --> 19:19.418
Well, can't you do one of your
super-powered vampire jumpy things?

19:19.591 --> 19:21.923
No, it's your last day as a human.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.028
Why cheat now?

19:46.585 --> 19:50.612
- Look who's dumb enough to come back.
- Well, somebody had to invite him in.

19:53.025 --> 19:57.724
Damon, you like to, uh, come in?

20:03.335 --> 20:05.235
Are you trying to get me killed?

20:06.672 --> 20:09.903
I gave you vervain
and I'm here to collect.

20:10.075 --> 20:12.771
- I got it from here, Ric.
- You sure?

20:12.945 --> 20:14.606
Only one of us needs to get blamed.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.079
Get back to the house.
Keep Elena from handing herself over.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.582
Get blamed for what?

20:20.786 --> 20:23.118
Need to know
where Klaus is keeping his werewolf.

20:23.288 --> 20:27.156
- Why? What are you gonna do?
- A dead werewolf equals no ritual.

20:27.326 --> 20:28.816
No. You can't interfere, Damon.

20:28.994 --> 20:31.326
Klaus will kill you
and everyone you've ever met.

20:31.496 --> 20:34.294
- I just need to delay this thing.
- No. No way.

20:34.466 --> 20:37.594
You should like this. It's gonna buy
another month of your life.

20:37.769 --> 20:42.468
Right. Except that I'm not the vampire
he's planning on sacrificing.

20:42.941 --> 20:45.705
- What?
- Yeah, he's got Caroline Forbes...

20:45.877 --> 20:46.969
...and Tyler Lockwood.

20:47.145 --> 20:49.670
Therefore, I'm in the clear.

20:49.848 --> 20:52.009
- And where did he get that idea from?
- Hey.

20:52.184 --> 20:56.177
Hey, hey, I'm just trying to stay alive
long enough to get myself out of here.

20:59.024 --> 21:02.323
What if I told you
Elena had vampire blood in her system?

21:02.861 --> 21:04.852
- What?
- Imagine how much fun that'll be...

21:05.030 --> 21:09.296
...competing with Elena for Stefan's love
for, I don't know, forever.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.600
The tomb.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.372
He's got them in the tomb.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.471
Thank you.

21:33.158 --> 21:34.989
- Tyler?
- Are you all right?

21:35.160 --> 21:36.559
Yeah.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.787
I think so.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.592
- Unh! Unh.
- I already tried.

21:49.207 --> 21:51.732
- Those witches vervained me.
- Who were they?

21:52.544 --> 21:55.035
- I think they're with Klaus.
- Who the hell is Klaus?

21:57.582 --> 21:58.708
Tyler.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.354
You shouldn't have come back here.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.921
I guess Bonnie will have
to make me a daylight ring.

22:14.099 --> 22:15.191
Yeah, piece of cake.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.892
And I'll never be able
to watch <i>Bambi</i> again.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.903
I definitely
wouldn't recommend doing that.

22:21.073 --> 22:24.236
What's the best part
about being a vampire?

22:24.743 --> 22:26.233
Ugh.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.403
It's...
You feel like you can do anything.

22:29.715 --> 22:31.478
Be anyone.

22:32.217 --> 22:36.153
Beautiful things are more beautiful,
everything is heightened.

22:36.321 --> 22:39.984
And you just live more intensely,
love more powerfully.

22:40.192 --> 22:43.389
- And the worst?
- Ah, you know the worst.

22:43.562 --> 22:44.824
Aside from the blood.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.634
Anger becomes rage.

22:52.904 --> 22:56.738
When you're sad, you're in despair.

22:57.309 --> 23:00.472
Grief, loss...

23:00.746 --> 23:01.906
...can cripple you.

23:05.083 --> 23:08.814
That's why so many of us
turn our emotions off. It just becomes...

23:09.755 --> 23:11.780
...too overwhelming.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.660
You know, for a while, for me...

23:19.331 --> 23:21.424
...the good just wasn't worth the bad.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.793
How long before you learned
to handle both?

23:24.970 --> 23:26.699
I'm still trying.

23:26.872 --> 23:28.100
Every day.

23:32.978 --> 23:34.775
What else?

23:35.947 --> 23:40.111
Let's just keep going.
We're not even halfway to the top.

23:56.668 --> 23:57.794
Everything okay?

24:00.972 --> 24:02.166
What have you been doing?

24:02.808 --> 24:04.332
Making coffee. Do you want some?

24:06.711 --> 24:09.305
Tell me what you've been doing.

24:10.048 --> 24:11.640
Making coffee.

24:21.993 --> 24:23.585
Wait.

24:29.434 --> 24:31.061
Take off your bracelet.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.531
Now...

24:37.909 --> 24:40.070
...I want you...

24:40.245 --> 24:44.341
...to walk over to the window
and stand in the sunlight.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.512
- But I'll burn.
- You don't have a choice.

25:08.406 --> 25:09.703
That's enough.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.509
Hmm.

25:14.713 --> 25:15.941
Guess I was wrong.

25:17.048 --> 25:18.913
All right, then.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.853
I need you to do something for me.

25:31.129 --> 25:33.154
Which one are you trying to save?

25:33.365 --> 25:36.129
The blond or the wolf?

25:39.905 --> 25:42.931
Did you really think Klaus
would leave them unprotected?

25:43.108 --> 25:44.268
Wishful thinking.

26:17.042 --> 26:19.533
- What are you doing here?
- Where's Caroline?

26:19.711 --> 26:21.838
Listen, man.
Not a good time to play hero.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.713
Where is she? What did he do to her?

26:25.917 --> 26:28.545
I'm just here to rescue her. Okay?

26:32.057 --> 26:34.821
You're lucky
I already screwed up once today...

26:35.026 --> 26:37.187
...or you'd be dead.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.240
The whole sun and moon curse
is fake?

26:50.408 --> 26:51.705
That's what Elena learned.

26:52.377 --> 26:56.780
Klaus still needs to do the sacrifice.
But it's just not for that.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.917
And you think that's why
they grabbed us? For the sacrifice?

27:00.085 --> 27:01.712
Yes.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.147
He's going to kill us?

27:03.888 --> 27:05.651
I think so.

27:05.857 --> 27:07.484
Yes.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.962
This whole time I've been gone...

27:13.131 --> 27:16.123
...Jules has been helping me
come to terms with what I am.

27:17.268 --> 27:19.293
How to deal with it.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.065
None of it matters anymore.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.744
Why didn't you say goodbye?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.811
You just left.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.076
You wanna talk about this now?

27:37.155 --> 27:40.682
Well, if we're gonna die,
I might as well know the truth.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.130
Why did you leave me?

27:49.968 --> 27:51.299
I knew you hated me.

27:53.405 --> 27:59.674
I thought you deserved better than
having someone like me in your life.

28:00.278 --> 28:01.939
I was hurt, you know.

28:02.113 --> 28:05.014
You turned your back on me
when I needed you.

28:08.953 --> 28:12.218
But I could never hate you, Tyler.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.329
- Damon?
- Boy's outside with a rifle...

28:22.500 --> 28:24.297
...Ioaded with wooden bullets.

28:24.469 --> 28:25.731
You have explaining to do.

28:25.937 --> 28:28.030
- Matt?
- Matt knows about you?

28:28.206 --> 28:29.298
No, l...

28:29.474 --> 28:32.671
Shh. Tomorrow's problem.
Why don't we get you out of here?

28:34.379 --> 28:35.539
Wait, Damon. No.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.682
- I'm not leaving without him.
- Ugh.

28:40.652 --> 28:41.744
It's getting dark soon.

28:41.953 --> 28:43.580
How fast can you get away
from here?

28:43.755 --> 28:45.746
I need to get to my family's cellar.

28:45.957 --> 28:47.948
- I can lock myself up.
- I'll help.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.463
Don't make me regret this.

28:59.671 --> 29:01.400
We made it. Unh.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.508
That was nothing.
I've climbed Mount Everest.

29:04.676 --> 29:07.201
Nobody likes a bragger, Stefan. Heh.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.680
Oh, wow.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.043
Yeah.

29:20.692 --> 29:21.750
Now you can say it.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.691
- What?
- The thing you've been wanting to say...

29:24.863 --> 29:28.697
...but afraid
of how it'll make me feel.

29:28.867 --> 29:32.200
There's nothing I can say, Stefan.
It's not gonna change anything.

29:33.638 --> 29:35.902
It might make you feel better.

29:40.011 --> 29:43.276
Look, I know this isn't the first time
you've thought about it.

29:44.082 --> 29:46.073
Drinking vampire blood to survive.

29:46.251 --> 29:48.116
I've thought about it a hundred times.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.449
Before all this with Klaus,
did you think about it then?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.420
Of course, I did.

29:54.559 --> 29:55.924
Look.

29:57.328 --> 30:01.560
If it were my choice,
I'd wanna be with you forever.

30:04.169 --> 30:05.796
Why have you never brought it up?

30:05.970 --> 30:08.302
Because I knew if it was an option,
you would've.

30:08.573 --> 30:11.133
It would be selfish of me to ask you.

30:11.342 --> 30:14.539
- It didn't stop Damon.
- He shouldn't have done what he did.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.482
He did it because he loves you.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.288
But he did this to me, Stefan.

30:24.455 --> 30:27.424
Which means he doesn't really know
what love is.

30:28.059 --> 30:29.583
And to be honest...

30:29.961 --> 30:32.623
...I don't know if I do.
I'm 17 years old.

30:32.797 --> 30:34.856
How am I supposed to know
any of this yet?

30:37.502 --> 30:41.131
I know that I love you, Stefan.
I know that.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.368
But my future?

30:43.575 --> 30:45.839
Our lives together?

30:46.377 --> 30:50.336
Those were things I was supposed
to deal with as they came along.

30:51.382 --> 30:53.782
I was supposed to grow up.

30:56.387 --> 31:00.483
Decide if I wanna have kids
and start a family.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.690
Grow old.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.194
I was supposed to have a lifetime
of those choices.

31:07.999 --> 31:10.627
And now, it's all gone.

31:10.802 --> 31:12.667
Elena, say it.

31:14.172 --> 31:15.230
Please.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.968
I don't wanna be a vampire, Stefan.

31:20.111 --> 31:21.806
I never wanted to be one.

31:22.313 --> 31:23.371
I know.

31:25.416 --> 31:26.474
It's okay.

31:39.664 --> 31:42.462
Hey, Matt. Hey.

31:42.634 --> 31:43.692
Did you hit him?

31:43.868 --> 31:46.496
Did you already forget the part
about the gun with the wooden bullets?

31:48.239 --> 31:49.900
Tyler?

31:52.844 --> 31:53.936
It's starting.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.570
Ugh. Grab boy wonder. Let's go.

31:58.182 --> 31:59.740
Come on.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.245
Thanks for today.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.150
You had me all nervous.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.887
I thought maybe you'd done
something stupid.

32:40.525 --> 32:42.254
You ready, my dear?

32:45.964 --> 32:47.795
I'm ready.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.628
No.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.834
I wouldn't.

32:53.171 --> 32:55.537
- No reason for you to die too.
- No.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.776
Stefan, hey. Hey. It's fine. It's fine.

32:59.177 --> 33:00.576
I'll go.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.474
No one needs to get hurt.

33:05.350 --> 33:07.181
There's no reason for you to get hurt.

33:21.632 --> 33:23.566
I love you.

33:32.276 --> 33:34.210
I love you.

33:48.092 --> 33:49.650
Close your eyes.

33:55.833 --> 33:57.323
Close your eyes.

34:27.165 --> 34:30.157
There you are.
I got here, the house was empty.

34:30.868 --> 34:31.994
Where's Damon?

34:32.170 --> 34:34.502
- What's happened? Is he okay?
- He better not wolf out on us.

34:35.873 --> 34:36.931
Bad time, little bro.

34:37.141 --> 34:38.904
- What are you doing?
<i>- Saving the day.</i>

34:39.077 --> 34:41.237
You understand.
Just tell Elena to stay put.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.607
- She's already gone, Damon.
- What?

34:43.781 --> 34:45.510
Klaus came.

34:45.716 --> 34:47.013
He took her.

34:49.954 --> 34:51.888
I'll take care of it.

34:57.562 --> 34:59.427
Tyler.

35:01.566 --> 35:03.932
God!

35:08.306 --> 35:10.774
I don't know if I can hold it off.
Get out of here.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.569
- Tyler, it'll be okay.
- Go!

35:13.277 --> 35:15.245
We've got time. We're almost there.

35:15.413 --> 35:18.348
It's happening faster. Unh!

35:18.516 --> 35:19.915
Tyler, it's okay.

35:32.196 --> 35:33.561
- Damon?
- I'm fine.

35:33.731 --> 35:35.665
Get out of here!

35:35.833 --> 35:39.132
Get to the Lockwood cellar.
If it held him in, it'll keep him out.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.965
If it doesn't, use these.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.301
It'll buy you a couple of seconds.

35:45.243 --> 35:46.801
Go.

35:57.722 --> 36:00.782
Where's Maddox?
He should be back by now.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.084
I don't know.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.860
What are you doing?

36:09.767 --> 36:10.825
Where is Elena?

36:11.002 --> 36:12.435
I sent her off with Greta.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.531
It's almost time.

36:22.980 --> 36:26.006
I wasn't aware
you'd been invited in.

36:27.351 --> 36:29.876
I've come to tell you
to postpone the ritual.

36:30.054 --> 36:31.954
Didn't we have this conversation?

36:32.123 --> 36:34.318
Before I rescued your werewolf
and vampire...

36:34.492 --> 36:36.255
...and killed your witch.

36:36.794 --> 36:38.125
Excuse me.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.797
And you can kill me for it.
I don't care.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.758
It was all me.

36:48.573 --> 36:50.006
Katerina, give us a moment.

37:04.088 --> 37:06.181
I've heard about you.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.848
The crazy, impulsive vampire...

37:10.828 --> 37:12.557
...in love with his brother's girl.

37:18.202 --> 37:21.603
I knew one of you
would try to stop me.

37:21.906 --> 37:25.239
It was just a fifty-fifty guess on who.

37:28.713 --> 37:31.045
- <i>Aah!</i>
- Heh.

37:32.383 --> 37:35.682
The nice thing about werewolves
is they tend to travel in packs.

37:40.124 --> 37:41.921
Need a closer look?

37:48.866 --> 37:50.595
Jules.

37:52.336 --> 37:55.237
When you spend a thousand years...

37:55.406 --> 37:58.102
...trying to break a curse...

38:00.645 --> 38:03.079
...you learn a thing or two.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.077
First rule:

38:08.419 --> 38:11.855
Always have a backup.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.318
Backup werewolf...

38:14.492 --> 38:16.357
...backup witch...

38:17.061 --> 38:19.086
Backup vampire.

38:19.563 --> 38:21.554
I've got that covered too.

38:26.837 --> 38:28.099
Come on.

38:28.272 --> 38:29.864
Down here.

38:38.582 --> 38:39.742
- Is that gonna hold?
- No.

38:44.889 --> 38:46.049
Help me with the gate.

38:46.757 --> 38:48.088
Help me with the gate.

39:05.276 --> 39:06.800
Tyler?

39:07.712 --> 39:09.646
It's me. It's Caroline.

39:11.649 --> 39:13.048
Tyler?

39:18.789 --> 39:20.279
Hey. Damon.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.457
Hey.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.359
- Damon.
- Uh...

39:26.263 --> 39:28.094
What the hell happened?

39:28.833 --> 39:32.291
He's gone. He went to do
the ritual. I'm sorry, I had to.

39:32.470 --> 39:35.496
He would've known
that I was on vervain if I didn't do it.

39:35.673 --> 39:36.765
Do what?

39:36.941 --> 39:38.340
Klaus.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.841
He made me call her to lure her out.
He needed another vampire.

39:42.813 --> 39:43.939
Who did you call?

39:48.352 --> 39:51.048
Who did you call, Katherine?

39:52.089 --> 39:54.250
- Where are we going?
- This way.

39:54.658 --> 39:56.853
You're Luka's sister, aren't you?

39:57.061 --> 39:58.255
I heard about you.

39:58.596 --> 40:01.156
He and your father
were looking for you.

40:01.332 --> 40:03.163
They were wasting their time.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.325
I wasn't lost.

40:10.775 --> 40:13.141
I can't see anything.

40:25.289 --> 40:26.881
Jenna?

40:28.526 --> 40:31.017
Jenna? Jenna? Jenna?

40:31.195 --> 40:33.663
Hey, hey, hey, Jenna. Jenna.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.297
Oh, my God. No.

40:37.468 --> 40:40.130
No, no, Jenna. No.

40:41.372 --> 40:45.138
He killed her? Why?
I did everything that he asked.

40:52.516 --> 40:53.676
She's not dead.

40:56.220 --> 40:57.710
She's in transition.

41:03.994 --> 41:06.019
He should have used me.

41:07.531 --> 41:09.692
- Why didn't he use me?
- He couldn't.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.602
Damon, he said
you were as good as dead.

41:12.770 --> 41:13.862
What's that even mean?

41:14.672 --> 41:16.572
What does it mean?

41:16.774 --> 41:18.241
What is this, Damon?

41:24.248 --> 41:26.580
It's a werewolf bite.

41:27.305 --> 41:33.406
