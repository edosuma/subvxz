01:17.166 --> 01:19.157
I grew up
in Northern Minnesota,

01:19.166 --> 01:21.157
and I remember snowdrifts

01:21.166 --> 01:23.157
that would bury
whole parking lots,

01:23.166 --> 01:25.157
icicles longer
than a hockey stick,

01:25.709 --> 01:27.700
and bein' stuck
with three layers of clothing.

01:27.709 --> 01:29.700
My favorite, though, was when

01:30.166 --> 01:32.703
they announced
exposed flesh warnings

01:33.166 --> 01:35.703
on the radio
to prevent frostbite.

01:35.709 --> 01:37.165
when I came to California,

01:37.709 --> 01:40.155
I found out
it's really a small world.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.157
They had exposed flesh
warnings, too,

01:42.166 --> 01:44.703
called beach parties.

01:47.709 --> 01:50.200
The type of party
that did away with frostbite.

01:50.208 --> 01:53.700
Did away with most
of the clothing, too.

01:56.709 --> 01:59.701
But the beach isn't
the only place for a party.

02:00.709 --> 02:02.199
And I had some friends

02:02.208 --> 02:05.746
who really knew
how to party down.

02:43.792 --> 02:46.249
You know, it took me a while

02:46.250 --> 02:48.241
to perfect the basket trick,
but, uh...

02:49.792 --> 02:51.248
there is absolutely

02:51.250 --> 02:52.786
no defense

02:52.792 --> 02:54.248
I can read your body.

02:54.792 --> 02:55.781
You're telegraphing your moves.

02:55.792 --> 02:56.781
Too much tension.

02:57.250 --> 02:58.239
I think it's the mask.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.241
It's just to help you
forget I'm a woman.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.786
Fat chance.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.783
A mask isn't
gonna do it.

03:05.792 --> 03:06.781
Tent maybe.

03:09.291 --> 03:11.282
Hello.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.282
It's yours.

03:15.792 --> 03:17.282
Lisa Chan. Hello.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.282
Sure I'm still interested.

03:21.291 --> 03:23.828
Um, I could fly up right away.

03:23.834 --> 03:26.280
I'll be there by noon.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.827
Ha!

03:27.834 --> 03:28.823
Bad news?

03:29.291 --> 03:30.827
That was a guy up
in San Francisco

03:31.291 --> 03:33.282
interested in financing
my karate studio.

03:33.291 --> 03:34.827
He wants me
to catch a 10:30 flight.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.290
That's terrific.

03:36.291 --> 03:37.280
You need a ride
to the airport?

03:37.291 --> 03:38.280
No, I'm okay.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.825
But I could use a small favor.

03:41.291 --> 03:42.280
Name it.

03:42.291 --> 03:44.327
Uh, Paul...
he's at a birthday party,

03:44.333 --> 03:45.823
and somebody's got
to pick him up.

03:46.333 --> 03:47.322
No problem.

03:47.333 --> 03:50.325
Mac, he's changed
since last year.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.324
He's a grown man of 14,

03:52.333 --> 03:54.324
and I'm his mean big sister.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.824
well, now that's just
because he's a teenager.

03:57.834 --> 03:59.324
Mac, he's started talking

03:59.333 --> 04:00.823
about our parents' death again,

04:00.834 --> 04:02.825
and that was seven years ago.

04:02.834 --> 04:04.870
I don't know
what he's thinking anymore,

04:04.875 --> 04:06.331
what he's doing,
who his friends are.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.322
All right.
I just can't

04:07.875 --> 04:08.864
get through
to him anymore!

04:08.875 --> 04:10.866
All right, all right, all right.
whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:10.875 --> 04:12.331
Relax a little, will ya?
I'll talk to him.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.869
where is this party?

04:13.875 --> 04:15.866
well, here's the address...

04:15.875 --> 04:18.332
but Paul's changed like crazy
since you last saw him.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.870
Yeah? Does he still have
that patch of white in his hair?

04:20.875 --> 04:22.331
Yeah.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.869
I'll recognize him.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.373
She gave me an address,

04:48.375 --> 04:50.366
but what I really needed
was a road map.

04:50.375 --> 04:51.911
In Chinatown,

04:52.375 --> 04:54.912
it helps to have some guidance
from a local expert.

05:23.959 --> 05:26.416
I first saw
him a month ago,

05:26.417 --> 05:28.408
and I believe he
is the wish Child.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.415
Perhaps.

05:53.458 --> 05:54.948
we are honored,

05:54.959 --> 05:56.950
Dr. Shen.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.449
The legend is 1200 years old,

06:00.458 --> 06:02.449
and I have lived
to see his return!

06:11.458 --> 06:13.995
I sense the spirit
of disbelief.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.994
we have never met.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.457
No.

06:19.001 --> 06:20.457
Yet you are a man of history.

06:20.458 --> 06:23.996
A cultural historian, yes.

06:24.001 --> 06:25.491
And you have brought me a test.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.992
This is the Rock of Shin Tze

06:43.001 --> 06:44.992
from the dynasty
of the wish Child.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.990
The legend states

06:47.500 --> 06:50.992
that the true wish Child
will bring a sign from the rock.

07:23.542 --> 07:24.531
I think

07:24.542 --> 07:27.033
you will know this.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.033
The sign of the wish Child.

07:58.041 --> 08:00.032
Hi. How are ya?

08:00.583 --> 08:02.039
Can't go in there.

08:02.041 --> 08:03.577
Private party.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.572
Yeah, I know.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.073
Um, I'm meetin' one
of the kids here.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.572
Paul Chan?

08:07.583 --> 08:09.073
His sister, Lisa,
can't pick him up.

08:09.083 --> 08:10.573
Neither can you.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.073
No problem.

08:14.583 --> 08:16.574
I remember the age
when it was cool to be bad.

08:18.083 --> 08:20.074
Dumb age.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.573
Somehow I didn't think

08:21.583 --> 08:23.073
they were serving ice cream
and cake

08:23.083 --> 08:24.072
at this birthday party,

08:24.625 --> 08:27.082
but it'd be rude
not to bring a present.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.116
Now, it just needed
some gift wrapping.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.616
Perfect.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.157
Hey!

09:30.166 --> 09:31.155
Oh, look
at this!

09:31.166 --> 09:32.656
Oh!

09:32.667 --> 09:33.656
Yeah, I was right.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.157
where did this come from?

09:35.166 --> 09:37.657
Dumb age.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.157
Oh, between my legs!

09:40.667 --> 09:41.656
Oh!

09:42.166 --> 09:43.155
Oh, there it goes!

09:44.166 --> 09:46.157
whose is it?

09:50.166 --> 09:52.157
Teenage party?

09:52.166 --> 09:54.157
whatever happened
to spin-the-bottle?

10:01.709 --> 10:03.700
Hey, Paul!

10:06.208 --> 10:07.197
what's goin' on?

10:07.208 --> 10:08.197
MacGyver!

10:08.208 --> 10:09.698
who is he?

10:09.709 --> 10:10.698
Name's MacGyver.

10:12.709 --> 10:13.698
Uh-huh.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.741
The sign of the wish Child.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.741
Dr. Shen,
we must go!

10:55.750 --> 10:57.741
A nice quiet neighborhood,

10:58.250 --> 11:02.243
but not as loud
as the ringing in my ears.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.241
I had no idea how I got here...

11:07.792 --> 11:09.248
or even where here was,

11:09.250 --> 11:11.787
but I had definitely
run into some party animals.

11:24.291 --> 11:25.781
It's funny.

11:25.792 --> 11:28.784
Gunpowder smells the same
no matter how you write it.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.282
I was sittin' on a pile
of fireworks,

11:34.291 --> 11:36.782
and some joker's outside
playin' shake, rattle and roll.

11:44.291 --> 11:47.283
I'd had enough of this party.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.825
It was definitely time
to leave.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.324
So I figured

12:19.333 --> 12:22.325
a small directional explosive
would make a door...

12:24.333 --> 12:26.324
hopefully without blowin' up
the whole box.

12:46.875 --> 12:49.867
Anyway, it'd just be a matter
of seconds

12:49.875 --> 12:53.868
before light became a match,
and I'd either blow out...

12:53.875 --> 12:55.866
or up.

13:05.917 --> 13:08.374
No one told me
the party'd moved upstairs.

13:22.917 --> 13:24.407
Uh, excuse me!

13:24.417 --> 13:27.409
Uh... down, please!

13:39.917 --> 13:41.407
That's it!

13:52.959 --> 13:54.950
I changed my mind.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.416
I'm not taking
that cruise.

14:02.959 --> 14:05.951
It'd just take me forever
to get the police to believe

14:05.959 --> 14:09.451
a story about being shanghaied
in Chinatown,

14:09.458 --> 14:11.449
and that was too long to wait

14:11.458 --> 14:14.950
when I had to find a kid
who was in real trouble.

14:23.959 --> 14:27.451
Mr. Lee, Dr. Shen is here.

14:32.458 --> 14:33.994
Have him wait.

14:56.001 --> 14:59.493
Mr. Lee, I have news.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.491
Not here.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.492
Ot-Su, no one is to enter
this area.

16:03.542 --> 16:05.578
Mr. Lee...

16:05.583 --> 16:09.576
your collection brings honor
to our ancestors.

16:09.583 --> 16:12.040
Thank you, Dr. Shen.

16:12.041 --> 16:16.034
I have spent 40 years
and some wealth

16:16.041 --> 16:19.579
to preserve the truth
of the wish Child,

16:19.583 --> 16:21.574
to make the legend reality.

16:21.583 --> 16:24.040
Did you see this
boy, Paul Chan?

16:24.041 --> 16:25.577
Yes, I did.

16:25.583 --> 16:26.572
And?

16:27.083 --> 16:29.574
The boy...

16:30.083 --> 16:31.573
drew this

16:31.583 --> 16:33.574
out of the Rock of Shin Tze.

16:42.583 --> 16:44.073
But how?

16:44.083 --> 16:45.619
You x-rayed the stone.

16:45.625 --> 16:48.082
and found no markings,
nothing inside.

16:48.625 --> 16:51.082
The legend states
that the wish Child shall find

16:51.083 --> 16:53.620
the soul of the stone.

16:53.625 --> 16:56.617
That is correct.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.620
Then perhaps
finally...

16:59.625 --> 17:02.082
finally, he has returned.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.116
Lisa was out of touch.

17:11.125 --> 17:14.117
Paul was out of reach,
and the only place

17:14.125 --> 17:17.117
to start looking for him
was where I'd lost him.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.616
As agreed, Dr. Shen.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.616
I feel...

17:24.125 --> 17:26.662
that I must mention
one thing.

17:26.666 --> 17:29.124
This man, Stone...

17:29.125 --> 17:31.662
Is a petty criminal,

17:31.667 --> 17:34.124
dishonest...
by preference,

17:34.125 --> 17:37.117
a thief and swindler
by trade...

17:37.125 --> 17:39.662
with several murders
to his credit.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.658
Then you knew.

17:41.667 --> 17:45.159
I always know,
Dr. Shen,

17:45.166 --> 17:46.656
and I'm always prepared.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.157
I have found a most useful friend

17:49.166 --> 17:50.656
among Stone's people.

17:53.166 --> 17:56.158
Your research has been
most helpful.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.157
Thank you, Dr. Shen.

18:17.709 --> 18:20.155
Our lives...

18:20.166 --> 18:22.703
shall soon be joined.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.745
Guess the party was over.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.206
Pretty neat.

18:50.208 --> 18:52.199
when the guests went home,

18:52.208 --> 18:54.745
they took the furniture
with 'em.

18:59.208 --> 19:02.746
Sometimes you got to read
between the lines.

19:05.750 --> 19:08.241
whatever Paul was into
had something to do

19:08.250 --> 19:10.741
with the wish Child business.

19:13.250 --> 19:17.243
And this impression in the
floor was the only lead I had.

19:17.250 --> 19:22.745
And, of course,
it was in Chinese...

19:22.750 --> 19:24.786
so I had two choices.

19:24.792 --> 19:27.249
I could bring the interpreter
to the floor

19:27.250 --> 19:29.241
or take the floor
to the interpreter.

19:29.250 --> 19:33.243
The problem is,
how do you move a floor?

19:33.250 --> 19:37.243
First thing you need
is a chisel...

19:37.250 --> 19:40.788
and a chisel's no good
without a hammer.

19:48.792 --> 19:51.784
well... I got the message.

19:59.792 --> 20:02.283
Ah, this I think
you'll really like.

20:02.792 --> 20:04.282
Oh, see
the natural grain there?

20:04.291 --> 20:05.827
Yeah, it's $30.

20:05.834 --> 20:09.827
Oh, an honorable gift all the
way from China.

20:09.834 --> 20:10.823
Brought it
right from the dock.

20:11.291 --> 20:13.282
Uh, a real collector's item.

20:13.291 --> 20:14.280
See you.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.290
Hey, Sam!

20:16.291 --> 20:17.827
Hey, MacGyver!
what do you know?

20:18.291 --> 20:19.280
Good to see you, guy.

20:19.834 --> 20:20.823
So... hey, look.

20:20.834 --> 20:23.280
No more painted parrots, huh?

20:23.291 --> 20:25.327
These are authentic fakes
all the way from Taiwan.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.322
Straight off the boat?

20:26.333 --> 20:27.322
Cheap, too.

20:27.333 --> 20:28.823
Not in the market, Sammy.
Thank you.

20:29.333 --> 20:32.325
I'm looking for anything
you can tell me about this.

20:32.333 --> 20:33.322
Oh, wow!

20:33.834 --> 20:34.823
It's the wish Child.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.823
The what?

20:35.834 --> 20:37.324
A lot of noise on the street

20:37.333 --> 20:38.823
about this kid doing
the wish Child hustle,

20:38.834 --> 20:41.826
so I am currently offering

20:41.834 --> 20:42.823
these real, genuine copies

20:42.834 --> 20:46.873
of a certified replica
in the Golden Era Museum.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.866
Now, you can't get
more honest than that.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.331
Hey, Mac, the museum's doing

20:50.333 --> 20:52.870
a heavy research thing
on the wish Child legend.

20:52.875 --> 20:53.864
Mucho hot item.

20:54.333 --> 20:55.322
Hey, on me.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.331
Thank you.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.325
I'm looking for the kid
who's playing this wish Child.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.869
Right. That's his symbol.

21:01.875 --> 21:03.331
See, a lot of people
are fighting

21:03.333 --> 21:04.869
to put good money down
on the kid.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.365
It's a great gig.

21:06.375 --> 21:07.865
You mean hustle?

21:08.375 --> 21:11.367
well... most people
don't buy it,

21:11.375 --> 21:12.865
but enough do.

21:12.875 --> 21:14.866
we're talking old time
Chinese legends here.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.365
I mean ancient.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.866
A lot of people believe
that 400 years ago,

21:18.875 --> 21:21.867
the wish Child was reborn
as a warlord's son,

21:21.875 --> 21:24.366
and after a battle,
the whole family's knocked off,

21:24.375 --> 21:25.911
while the wish Child's
just wandering around

21:26.375 --> 21:27.911
in the mountains
totally zonked out

21:27.917 --> 21:29.373
with no memory of the attack,

21:29.375 --> 21:31.912
except that a patch of his hair
has turned white.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.911
A white patch?

21:34.917 --> 21:37.909
Yeah, snow white.
And no memory.

21:37.917 --> 21:39.373
Then a bandit nabs him,

21:39.917 --> 21:41.373
recognizes him
as the wish Child,

21:41.375 --> 21:42.911
tries to sell him.

21:42.917 --> 21:44.908
Sell him
because he grants wishes?

21:44.917 --> 21:46.908
Better. Heavier.

21:47.417 --> 21:49.408
The legend says
you link your soul to his,

21:49.417 --> 21:51.908
you got immortality.

21:51.917 --> 21:54.408
Oh, if I could only
bottle it, I'd be rich.

21:54.417 --> 21:57.409
Sammy, I'm talking
about a 14-year-old kid

21:57.417 --> 22:00.909
from Santa Monica,
not the "Mists of Antiquity."

22:00.917 --> 22:02.908
who's bottling him?

22:02.917 --> 22:06.956
Guy named Stone, half-Chinese,
half sewer rat out of Hong Kong.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.415
He tries to play legit.

22:08.959 --> 22:09.414
Owns a restaurant

22:09.959 --> 22:11.950
in the lower district.

22:11.959 --> 22:14.951
This a... hustler type,

22:14.959 --> 22:17.416
about six feet,
real fashion plate?

22:17.417 --> 22:20.955
Yeah, but, MacGyver,
Stone comes on like Mr. Clean,

22:20.959 --> 22:22.415
but he's really
down and dirty.

22:22.959 --> 22:23.948
And there's a lot
of people here

22:23.959 --> 22:25.449
that still believe
the legend,

22:25.458 --> 22:27.949
so Stone'll keep selling
the kid as long as he can.

22:27.959 --> 22:29.449
But when it's over,
so's the kid,

22:29.959 --> 22:30.948
you know what I mean?

22:30.959 --> 22:32.449
Yeah.

22:32.458 --> 22:34.949
The kid's my
responsibility.

22:34.959 --> 22:37.450
He's also my friend.

22:37.458 --> 22:40.450
you know what I mean?

22:40.959 --> 22:42.449
Good luck, pal.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.994
You were quite a pro, kid.

22:53.001 --> 22:54.992
Did a hell of a job
on Shen wei today.

22:55.001 --> 22:56.457
It was easy switching
those rocks.

22:57.458 --> 23:00.450
I wonder if this
rock of his is real.

23:00.458 --> 23:01.447
who knows?

23:01.458 --> 23:02.994
Maybe I really am
the wish Child.

23:03.001 --> 23:05.492
Yeah, maybe you are
at that.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.991
Just got to keep it going
a little while longer.

23:08.001 --> 23:08.990
Sit tight.

23:13.001 --> 23:14.992
How did you hand
le that MacGyver guy?

23:15.500 --> 23:16.990
He shipped out
to New zealand.

23:17.001 --> 23:18.491
Hmm, nice touch.

23:19.001 --> 23:21.492
No body, no
cops, no noise.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.000
Diplomatic.

23:25.000 --> 23:25.989
Make out everything

23:26.000 --> 23:26.989
to Mr. Lee?

23:27.000 --> 23:27.989
No.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.991
Now Dr. Shen will
confirm to us.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.491
Did the old man, Dr. Shen,
buy the scam?

23:32.500 --> 23:34.991
Lock, stock
and phony rock.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.490
Kid was great.

23:37.000 --> 23:37.989
Mr. Lee made contact.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.490
He's interested.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.491
I'll meet him,
set up the deal.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.491
we'll have the money
and be rid of a kid.

23:43.500 --> 23:44.990
How?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.991
He won't be coming back.

23:48.542 --> 23:50.999
Got something special
for you, kid.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.536
whoa!

23:52.542 --> 23:54.533
I told you,
good things are coming.

23:54.542 --> 23:55.531
Rich things.

23:55.542 --> 23:56.531
Yeah!

23:56.542 --> 23:57.998
wait'll Lisa sees
the karate studio.

23:58.000 --> 23:58.989
I'm going to buy her.

23:59.542 --> 24:01.533
She'll stop thinking
I'm some kind of loser.

24:01.542 --> 24:04.534
Hey, everybody's going
to respect you, Paul, everybody.

24:04.542 --> 24:06.032
You are the wish Child.

24:06.041 --> 24:09.533
You know, sometimes I think
maybe what if I was!

24:10.041 --> 24:12.032
we both know
you're special, Paul.

24:12.542 --> 24:14.533
That's why it's going to be
great from now on, right?

24:14.542 --> 24:15.531
Right!

24:15.542 --> 24:17.032
See you a minute?

24:17.041 --> 24:19.032
Now go to the back room
and start rehearsing.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.030
I'll be right there.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.531
Okay.

24:32.583 --> 24:34.039
MacGyver!
Paul,

24:34.041 --> 24:36.032
I need to talk to you
just for a few minutes,

24:36.041 --> 24:37.030
away from here, okay?

24:37.583 --> 24:39.039
Okay.
All right, come on.

24:42.041 --> 24:44.578
what are you sneaking around
like this for?!

24:45.083 --> 24:47.574
So your friends back there don't
cream me again.

24:47.583 --> 24:50.074
Stone?
He wouldn't do that.

24:50.083 --> 24:51.072
He would.

24:51.583 --> 24:53.574
He did, and he will again
if I give him half a chance.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.574
Ji! The kid's missing.

24:56.583 --> 24:59.074
Find him!

24:59.083 --> 25:01.574
Aw, you're just saying that
just to get me to go home.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.073
well, I'm not; you can
just tell Lisa that, too.

25:09.083 --> 25:11.074
I've got a real big appointment
today, MacGyver,

25:11.083 --> 25:13.074
and you're not going
to blow it for me.

25:13.083 --> 25:14.619
Paul, if that appointment
is with Stone,

25:14.625 --> 25:15.614
it's dangerous to you.

25:15.625 --> 25:16.614
He's bad news.

25:18.625 --> 25:20.081
Mac, that man is my friend.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.074
You never spent time with him.

25:22.083 --> 25:23.619
Of course you don't trust him.

25:23.625 --> 25:25.625
Hey, he really
watches out for me.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.616
Look, look,
he gave me this.

25:27.625 --> 25:28.614
Ooh, neat.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.115
Is that
how you measure friendship?

25:30.625 --> 25:33.116
Stone talks to me
about my future.

25:33.125 --> 25:36.117
He understands me
better than Lisa or you.

25:36.125 --> 25:37.615
Your future... as
part of a scam?

25:37.625 --> 25:39.115
Terrific.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.114
we're not hurting
anybody.

25:45.667 --> 25:47.658
People really believe
I'm this wish Child,

25:47.667 --> 25:49.123
and it makes
them happy.

25:49.125 --> 25:50.114
They even
give me money.

25:55.125 --> 25:57.662
It's a rip-off, Paul,
and you know it!

25:58.125 --> 26:00.662
Or do you really believe
you're this wish Child?

26:00.667 --> 26:03.659
Look, that car accident
killed my mom and dad,

26:03.667 --> 26:06.158
and I wasn't even touched,
except for this.

26:06.166 --> 26:09.658
Just like in the legend.

26:09.667 --> 26:11.658
You don't believe it,
do you?

26:18.166 --> 26:19.656
Believe this, Paul.

26:20.166 --> 26:21.656
I care about you.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.658
I consider us friends.

26:23.667 --> 26:25.157
I'm not a kid anymore.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.703
All right... Let's talk,
man to man.

26:29.709 --> 26:33.156
Let's get out of here first, what
do you say, huh?

26:55.208 --> 26:57.699
Mac, what
are you doing?

26:58.208 --> 26:59.698
Paul, they're hunting for us.

26:59.709 --> 27:02.200
The only way out
is over that wall.

27:02.208 --> 27:03.698
with an umbrella?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.199
No, a grappling hook.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.206
Paul, get that rope.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.744
That a boy.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.786
All right, come on!

27:50.792 --> 27:52.248
Paul!

27:54.792 --> 27:56.248
Come on! Paul!

27:58.792 --> 27:59.781
They won't hurt me, Mac.

27:59.792 --> 28:00.781
They work for Stone.

28:01.250 --> 28:01.784
Yeah, right.

28:02.250 --> 28:03.786
Don't worry about it, Mac.

28:03.792 --> 28:05.282
I know what I'm doing.

28:05.291 --> 28:06.280
Paul!

28:06.291 --> 28:07.280
Don't worry.

28:10.291 --> 28:11.781
You heard what he said.

28:11.792 --> 28:13.282
Be nice.

28:55.959 --> 28:59.406
well, there went Paul,
on his way

28:59.959 --> 29:01.950
to that important appointment.

29:01.959 --> 29:03.415
And all I had for a road map

29:03.959 --> 29:05.449
was a postcard
I didn't understand

29:05.458 --> 29:07.449
in a language I couldn't read.

29:07.458 --> 29:09.949
But I remembered one thing.

29:10.458 --> 29:13.950
Sammy had lifted this
from the Golden Era Museum

29:13.959 --> 29:17.451
where I might find something
more about the wish Child.

29:32.001 --> 29:34.447
I used to love museums
when I was a kid.

29:34.458 --> 29:36.449
You never knew
what you'd find inside.

29:40.458 --> 29:42.995
I liked mysteries back then.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.993
Surprising...
to find a Caucasian scholar

30:18.000 --> 30:20.491
of the wish Child legend.

30:20.500 --> 30:24.994
well, the name's MacGyver,
and I was looking for a...

30:25.000 --> 30:27.992
Didn't I see you at a ceremony
with Paul Chan?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.991
The wish Child, yes.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.536
I am Dr. Shen wei.

30:31.542 --> 30:33.999
Yeah. I am here
because of the legend,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.536
and because of Paul.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.999
His family asked me
to look after him.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.991
Look after the wish Child?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.991
Let me show you something,

30:42.000 --> 30:43.536
Mr. MacGyver.
MacGyver.

30:43.542 --> 30:47.034
It was a violent time,
400 years ago.

30:47.041 --> 30:49.532
The Child was attacked,

30:49.542 --> 30:53.535
but while his protectors
were killed...

30:53.542 --> 30:56.033
he survived, miraculously.

30:56.041 --> 30:58.032
And wandered into the mountains.

30:58.041 --> 31:00.032
You know.

31:00.041 --> 31:01.030
I've heard.

31:01.041 --> 31:02.531
And you have doubts.

31:03.041 --> 31:04.531
Understandable,

31:04.542 --> 31:07.579
but we have records
four centuries old.

31:07.583 --> 31:10.040
He was taken by
a bandit chiefta in

31:10.583 --> 31:12.574
and sold for a
fortune in gold.

31:13.041 --> 31:14.030
Paul.

31:14.041 --> 31:15.577
He is the wish Child.

31:15.583 --> 31:18.575
He is a 14-year-old kid
from Santa Monica

31:18.583 --> 31:20.574
who's in a lot of trouble.

31:20.583 --> 31:23.040
Now, what does this Stone
want to do with Paul?

31:25.041 --> 31:26.577
Good to have
you back, kid.

31:26.583 --> 31:29.074
MacGyver just doesn't
understand, that's all.

31:29.583 --> 31:32.575
I mean, we're not really
cheating this Mr. Lee, are we?

31:32.583 --> 31:35.074
Paul, Mr. Lee
asked to meet us.

31:35.083 --> 31:37.074
And he's a very rich man.

31:37.083 --> 31:40.575
If it makes him happy
to see the wish Child,

31:40.583 --> 31:42.073
that's great.

31:42.083 --> 31:44.574
And if it's worth money to him,
that's up to him, isn't it?

31:45.083 --> 31:46.619
we're not really
twisting his arms.

31:47.083 --> 31:48.072
You know, I feel
like it's real.

31:48.625 --> 31:49.614
Paul,

31:49.625 --> 31:51.616
it's $1 millio
n worth of real.

31:51.625 --> 31:53.081
For you and me.

31:53.083 --> 31:54.072
Right.

31:54.625 --> 31:55.080
Mr. Stone.

32:00.625 --> 32:03.082
welcome.

32:09.625 --> 32:11.616
I do not know
Mr. Stone's business.

32:12.125 --> 32:14.116
I'm a scholar,
Mr. MacGyver.

32:14.125 --> 32:15.615
whose?

32:17.625 --> 32:20.617
Come on, Dr. Shen,
who's paying for all this?

32:20.625 --> 32:22.616
who's the money source so hooked

32:22.625 --> 32:25.662
on the wish Child, huh?

32:25.667 --> 32:27.658
His name is
Lee wenying,

32:27.667 --> 32:29.658
but he is only interested

32:29.667 --> 32:31.658
in the wish Child as a
scholar.

32:31.667 --> 32:34.124
As the legend
come alive.

32:34.125 --> 32:36.662
I have always felt... special.

32:40.667 --> 32:43.124
Always?

32:43.125 --> 32:46.162
Or since the day
of your parents' tragic death?

32:50.667 --> 32:52.157
Tell me.

32:52.166 --> 32:54.657
I don't want
to bring back an old pain,

32:54.667 --> 32:56.157
but it is necessary.

33:08.709 --> 33:10.700
we were going to visit Lisa,

33:11.166 --> 33:13.157
my sister, at her college.

33:15.709 --> 33:18.701
It was a mountain road,
real twisty.

33:19.709 --> 33:21.700
There were rocks on the road.

33:21.709 --> 33:24.701
And the car... slipped,

33:26.208 --> 33:28.199
and Dad yelled...

33:29.709 --> 33:31.199
and...

33:31.208 --> 33:33.199
the car hit the fence, and
it went over

33:33.208 --> 33:35.699
and down, and...

33:35.709 --> 33:37.700
and I heard Mom, I heard...

33:37.709 --> 33:39.199
Child!

33:39.208 --> 33:40.698
I don't
remember!

33:42.208 --> 33:45.200
I was crying
and running all night.

33:45.208 --> 33:47.199
I... just don't remember!

33:54.750 --> 33:57.207
That's all right.

33:57.208 --> 33:59.199
Neither did the wish Child.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.741
He wandered into the mountains

34:01.750 --> 34:05.197
becoming what he was to be.

34:21.250 --> 34:24.242
You see, I was paid
to verify a possibility.

34:24.250 --> 34:27.788
That the legend, the wish Child,
had reappeared.

34:27.792 --> 34:31.239
Mr. Lee contacted Stone
so he could talk to Paul.

34:31.250 --> 34:33.241
where do I find him?

34:33.250 --> 34:34.786
I'm sorry.

34:34.792 --> 34:37.784
Dr. Shen, I have been slugged,

34:37.792 --> 34:40.248
dumped, shanghaied

34:40.250 --> 34:41.786
and shot at.

34:41.792 --> 34:43.783
And I think the reason is
because of Paul.

34:43.792 --> 34:45.248
Now why?

34:45.250 --> 34:47.792
what does Mr. Lee want with him?

34:47.792 --> 34:49.282
Some believe

34:49.291 --> 34:51.282
that a man can achieve
immortality

34:51.792 --> 34:54.283
by linking his soul
with that of the Child.

34:54.291 --> 34:57.783
And Mr. Lee wenying is old.

34:57.792 --> 35:00.283
He will cherish the boy,

35:00.291 --> 35:01.781
protect him.

35:01.792 --> 35:04.784
As long as the Child is alive,
Mr. Lee will live.

35:04.792 --> 35:06.828
Protect him?

35:06.834 --> 35:08.825
Don't you mean keep him?

35:10.834 --> 35:12.825
You helped sell
a 14-year-old boy

35:12.834 --> 35:14.825
into slavery for life.

35:14.834 --> 35:16.290
No.

35:16.834 --> 35:18.290
Oh, yeah!

35:18.834 --> 35:21.826
The legend says a bandit sold
the Child for gold.

35:21.834 --> 35:23.825
Now Stone may have done
the selling,

35:23.834 --> 35:25.290
but you okayed the sale.

35:28.834 --> 35:29.823
Nobody but you.

35:32.333 --> 35:33.322
Now where's Paul?

35:37.333 --> 35:38.322
Paul...

35:38.333 --> 35:39.823
Paul is...

35:43.333 --> 35:45.324
Dr. Shen?

35:46.333 --> 35:49.871
Mr. Lee did not believe me.

35:51.333 --> 35:53.324
Dr. Shen,

35:53.333 --> 35:55.870
you must tell me where Paul is.
Please!

35:58.333 --> 36:00.324
In the freighter.

36:00.875 --> 36:04.868
Pier... K-63.

36:06.875 --> 36:09.366
Forward hold.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.366
Steel door.

36:11.375 --> 36:14.867
Child inside that door.

36:20.875 --> 36:22.866
I felt this in the stone.

36:23.375 --> 36:26.367
Proof, Mr. Lee, he is the Child.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.366
Proof?

36:28.375 --> 36:29.364
Come, I will test you.

36:36.917 --> 36:38.373
The handprint of the Child.

36:38.375 --> 36:40.912
400 years ago

36:40.917 --> 36:42.373
in the temple wall.

36:42.375 --> 36:44.366
Place your hand
in the impression.

36:53.417 --> 36:54.907
You are the Child.

36:56.917 --> 36:58.407
You are.

36:59.417 --> 37:00.406
Come!

37:01.417 --> 37:02.907
How did you do that?

37:03.417 --> 37:05.408
I don't know.
It just fit.

37:08.417 --> 37:13.411
This was the Child,
as you are the Child.

37:13.417 --> 37:16.409
It looks just like me.

37:16.959 --> 37:17.414
Of course.

37:17.959 --> 37:19.415
Mr. Stone...

37:19.417 --> 37:21.408
the money is yours,
the Child is mine.

37:21.417 --> 37:23.408
Stone, what's he talking about?

37:23.417 --> 37:24.953
Sorry, kid. Good-bye.

37:24.959 --> 37:26.449
Stone!

37:26.458 --> 37:27.948
Stone!

37:27.959 --> 37:29.449
Hey, let me out!

37:29.458 --> 37:31.449
I'm not this wish Child.
It was a fake.

37:31.458 --> 37:32.447
Stone!

37:32.959 --> 37:34.449
Stone.

37:42.959 --> 37:47.453
Mr. Lee's boat ran
about 50,000 tons.

37:47.458 --> 37:49.449
A little bit smaller
than Fort Knox,

37:50.001 --> 37:51.457
but about as hard to bust into.

37:54.458 --> 37:56.449
I could make
an official complaint,

37:56.458 --> 37:58.995
and something might happen

37:59.001 --> 38:01.993
about six days
after the ship sailed.

38:02.001 --> 38:04.447
So I'll just have to put
something together.

38:05.001 --> 38:06.491
You did a fine job, Mr. Stone.

38:06.500 --> 38:07.990
Thank you.

38:08.001 --> 38:10.492
Now if you leave
over this side of the ship,

38:11.001 --> 38:12.491
no one will see you.

38:12.500 --> 38:13.990
Good.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.992
As agreed, $1 million

38:16.001 --> 38:17.992
...in gold.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.990
Is that satisfactory,

38:25.001 --> 38:25.990
Mr. Stone?

38:26.000 --> 38:27.490
Yes, indeed.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.489
Good.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.990
Teng?

38:51.542 --> 38:54.534
An honorable bargain, Mr. Stone.

38:54.542 --> 38:56.999
The gold is yours forever.

38:59.542 --> 39:01.999
Old Minnesota wisdom:

39:02.000 --> 39:03.991
If you don't
want to be touched,

39:04.542 --> 39:07.534
look downright untouchable.

39:15.542 --> 39:17.533
I will set the course
once we're at sea, Captain.

39:17.542 --> 39:19.032
Yes, sir!

39:19.041 --> 39:21.532
I expect to cast off
in 37 minutes.

39:27.041 --> 39:29.578
Okay! Stand clear, mate.

39:29.583 --> 39:31.039
Just got this fixed.

39:31.041 --> 39:33.032
Steady up!

40:14.625 --> 40:15.614
You, there!

40:16.083 --> 40:17.619
where are you going?

40:17.625 --> 40:18.614
Nobody allowed
in this section.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.081
Oh yeah?

40:20.083 --> 40:22.074
You want to tell Mr. Lee

40:22.083 --> 40:25.075
he's not getting
his auxiliary fixed? Huh?

40:25.083 --> 40:27.119
I didn't think so.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.116
Don't touch that.
It's important.

40:51.125 --> 40:53.116
Hey, what are
you doing here?

40:54.125 --> 40:56.116
This is the forward hold,
isn't it?

40:56.125 --> 40:57.661
Yeah. I got work to do down here.

40:57.667 --> 40:59.123
Hold that,
will ya?

40:59.125 --> 41:00.114
Ow!

41:01.667 --> 41:03.123
Let go of me!

41:03.667 --> 41:04.122
Let go of me!

41:04.125 --> 41:07.663
wait a minute!
what are you doing?

41:07.667 --> 41:08.656
Give me back my gun...

41:08.667 --> 41:10.157
I'll just hold this for ya,
all right?

41:10.166 --> 41:11.656
Get me down!

41:11.667 --> 41:13.157
I said get
me down!

41:13.667 --> 41:16.659
Get me down!
Get me down!

41:16.667 --> 41:18.157
Get back here!

41:18.166 --> 41:19.656
Get me down!

41:19.667 --> 41:21.658
Get me down!

41:25.667 --> 41:27.157
Aah!

41:31.709 --> 41:34.701
Try to shoot the lock
out of a steel door,

41:34.709 --> 41:37.701
and bullets'd just bounce off.

41:37.709 --> 41:40.155
Besides, I hate guns.

41:49.709 --> 41:51.199
Now, Teng, call
me when we cast off.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.698
I'll be below.

42:16.750 --> 42:20.197
Now if you get the gunpowder
inside the lock...

42:23.750 --> 42:26.241
and rig a cartridge
as kind of a fuse...

42:28.250 --> 42:31.242
then use the gun
the right way...

42:31.250 --> 42:32.239
bingo!

42:41.750 --> 42:43.240
Mac!
what?!

42:43.250 --> 42:44.239
Am I glad
to see you!

42:44.250 --> 42:45.239
You were right
about Stone!

42:45.250 --> 42:46.786
They were gonna...
All right, all right.

42:46.792 --> 42:48.783
Tell me along the way. Come on.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.786
what are you doing?

43:16.792 --> 43:18.783
Hold that up.

43:25.291 --> 43:26.827
Mr. Lee?

43:43.834 --> 43:44.823
Child?

43:44.834 --> 43:46.324
what?

43:46.333 --> 43:47.823
Ta-ya!

43:51.333 --> 43:52.823
Is that you?

43:52.834 --> 43:53.823
Paul, let's move!

44:10.333 --> 44:11.869
Child, come back!

44:11.875 --> 44:12.864
Come back, Child!

44:13.333 --> 44:14.322
Come back!

44:18.333 --> 44:19.869
Hold it!

44:19.875 --> 44:21.866
Child!

44:22.333 --> 44:23.322
Let's try this way!

44:29.875 --> 44:32.366
Guard! Guard!

44:32.375 --> 44:33.364
Open the door.

44:33.375 --> 44:35.866
Guard!

44:35.875 --> 44:37.866
Let me out!

44:40.875 --> 44:42.365
The child escaped.

44:42.375 --> 44:44.866
He must not
leave the ship!

44:44.875 --> 44:46.365
Up the ladder.

44:46.375 --> 44:47.364
Come on.

44:55.375 --> 44:56.911
Aah!

44:58.917 --> 44:59.906
Mac!

45:13.917 --> 45:15.908
Come on.

45:43.417 --> 45:44.953
Child!

45:44.959 --> 45:46.449
Come back!

45:50.458 --> 45:52.949
Child! Child!

45:58.458 --> 45:59.447
No!

45:59.458 --> 46:00.948
Come back!

46:00.959 --> 46:01.948
You must
stay with me!

46:02.458 --> 46:03.948
You must stay
with me.

46:03.959 --> 46:05.950
Our lives are one!

46:07.458 --> 46:08.447
Oh!

46:15.001 --> 46:16.457
Somebody help him.

46:16.458 --> 46:18.449
How?

46:19.001 --> 46:19.990
Grab the lifeboat?

46:20.001 --> 46:21.992
Maybe he believed in
the legend too much.

46:24.458 --> 46:26.494
Come on.

46:39.001 --> 46:39.990
Hmm.

46:40.001 --> 46:41.491
Mmm, good.

46:43.001 --> 46:43.990
Come in.

46:44.500 --> 46:45.489
Hi.

46:45.500 --> 46:46.489
Oh, hi, Lisa.

46:46.500 --> 46:48.491
Hey, Lisa,
how was San Francisco?

46:48.500 --> 46:49.489
Oh, don't ask.

46:49.500 --> 46:50.990
Oh, yeah?

46:51.000 --> 46:51.989
well, you're
just in time

46:52.000 --> 46:53.490
for pizza
aa la MacGyver.

46:53.500 --> 46:54.990
I need it.

46:55.000 --> 46:55.989
I had a day like a curse.

46:56.500 --> 46:57.489
That good, huh?

46:57.500 --> 46:59.491
Anyway, I see
you found him.

46:59.500 --> 47:00.489
No problem.

47:00.500 --> 47:01.990
So, was the
birthday party fun?

47:05.000 --> 47:06.536
Outstanding!
