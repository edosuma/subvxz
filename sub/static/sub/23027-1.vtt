May I have your attention, please?

01:06.125 --> 01:09.415
Now, all candidates will move

01:09.416 --> 01:12.832
to the Union Hall for a haircut.

01:12.833 --> 01:17.666
Say farewell to
your family and friends promptly.

01:17.916 --> 01:19.125
Salute!

01:20.208 --> 01:22.249
Listen to your superiors.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.750
Don't skip meals. Stay warm at night.

01:25.916 --> 01:27.832
Stay strong, baby.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.540
Come home if it gets too tough.

01:29.541 --> 01:30.625
Okay?

01:31.958 --> 01:34.707
I'll be fine. Don't you worry a thing.

01:34.708 --> 01:36.458
You stay well and healthy.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.208
Bye.

01:41.375 --> 01:42.250
Bye.

01:44.208 --> 01:45.540
Who are you texting?

01:45.541 --> 01:46.541
Mom.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.958
Should we hug too?

01:52.500 --> 01:55.083
You're right. I thought so.

01:57.791 --> 01:59.583
Bye, Dad.
Hee-yeol.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.291
I'm proud of you.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.250
It's cold today. Zip up before you go.

02:10.208 --> 02:12.125
Company, attention.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.041
Parade, rest.

02:16.208 --> 02:17.333
Flight, attention.

02:18.958 --> 02:21.500
To your parents. Present, arms.

02:23.833 --> 02:25.041
Order, arms.

02:26.166 --> 02:27.500
Left, face.

02:29.875 --> 02:31.625
Forward, march.

02:54.791 --> 02:58.082
Could you not cut it too short?

02:58.083 --> 02:59.957
My sideburns take forever to grow back.

02:59.958 --> 03:02.833
Please. It took me a year to grow my hair.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.041
The sideburns...

03:07.291 --> 03:09.083
Right there. Don't cut it too...

03:22.875 --> 03:24.166
Retard?

03:39.458 --> 03:40.666
Excuse me.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.499
Did you sterilize that hair clipper?

03:44.500 --> 03:45.458
No.

03:45.791 --> 03:48.083
That's what I was afraid of.

03:48.583 --> 03:52.040
Without sterilization,
it can cause bacterial skin infection.

03:52.041 --> 03:54.582
What if one hair clipper
infected everyone here...

03:54.583 --> 03:56.166
Wait, wait.

04:00.750 --> 04:04.250
Bacterial skin infection...

04:07.500 --> 04:12.415
This training is a condensed
2-week military training program.

04:12.416 --> 04:16.040
I hope you all complete the training by
following your drill instructors.

04:16.041 --> 04:21.165
Last year, 4 candidates out
of 96 dropped out of the program.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.499
You must remain alert till the end.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.041
Yes, Sir.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.040
You kids better learn to speak up.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.541
Yes, Sir.

04:29.708 --> 04:30.708
That's it.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.832
My father was
Class of 1985 of Police University.

04:37.833 --> 04:40.124
From early on, my father taught me well

04:40.125 --> 04:42.749
about public order and justice.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.207
You'll eventually learn them here.

04:45.208 --> 04:47.791
Order and justice are important.

04:48.291 --> 04:50.999
I want to become a police officer
just like my father.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.541
What brings you here?

04:53.000 --> 04:53.791
Me?

04:56.250 --> 04:57.375
I...

04:57.875 --> 05:00.375
What? You don't know?

05:01.083 --> 05:02.708
You came here to fool around?

05:05.291 --> 05:06.832
Attention, please.

05:06.833 --> 05:08.290
All candidates report immediately

05:08.291 --> 05:10.832
in full battle uniform
that you received today

05:10.833 --> 05:13.249
to the center field in 3 minutes.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.875
Anyone late will be severely punished.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Move!

05:18.750 --> 05:19.750
What the...

05:20.000 --> 05:22.601
1 min 40 sec left.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.208
Run. Out!

05:24.666 --> 05:27.250
1 min 30 sec left.

05:27.416 --> 05:29.416
Come out!

05:29.791 --> 05:31.208
Run forward.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.333
Jump higher.

05:41.625 --> 05:42.750
Squad, halt.

05:44.333 --> 05:45.582
Get up!

05:45.583 --> 05:47.642
Can't walk as a team?

05:47.666 --> 05:51.082
Go again from 1 to 100.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.625
Start.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.250
One.

06:01.625 --> 06:02.416
Two.

06:02.417 --> 06:03.541
United.

06:04.833 --> 06:06.125
Mind.

06:08.416 --> 06:09.458
Lower.

06:09.666 --> 06:11.166
Who's lying down?

06:11.458 --> 06:12.291
United.

06:12.291 --> 06:13.125
Squad, halt.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.583
Squad, halt.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.267
Cross-country Roll, start.

06:17.291 --> 06:19.208
Cross-country Roll, start.

06:20.708 --> 06:21.666
Roll faster. Go!

06:21.791 --> 06:23.291
Faster, faster, faster!

06:23.791 --> 06:24.892
Roll faster!

06:24.916 --> 06:25.625
Faster, faster!

06:25.626 --> 06:27.625
Wake up. Roll faster.

06:29.166 --> 06:30.666
Roll faster.

06:37.458 --> 06:38.416
One.

06:38.791 --> 06:39.666
Two.

06:40.208 --> 06:41.166
Three.

06:41.666 --> 06:42.583
Four.

06:43.083 --> 06:48.708
One, two, three, four.

06:54.958 --> 06:55.958
Sausages.

06:59.041 --> 07:01.040
Can I get more sausages?

07:01.041 --> 07:03.291
Then some won't get any.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.416
How can I eat all this rice
with just two sausages?

07:09.250 --> 07:11.040
Put some of the rice back.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.124
How can I?

07:12.125 --> 07:14.291
You come and sit down now.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.541
They're feeding us like kindergarteners.

07:34.666 --> 07:36.375
Aren't you gonna eat your sausages?

07:36.875 --> 07:37.750
No.

07:37.750 --> 07:38.708
Why not?

07:40.375 --> 07:44.958
Sausage is made with sodium glutamate
and sodium nitrate, which are carcinogens.

07:45.416 --> 07:47.041
So why won't you eat them?

07:47.666 --> 07:49.499
Why would you eat carcinogens on purpose?

07:49.500 --> 07:50.833
Then I'll take them.

07:51.208 --> 07:52.625
Sodium glutamate...

07:55.333 --> 07:56.458
Eat up.

08:07.375 --> 08:08.750
Lift your arms.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.249
Chest, 36.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.851
Put your arms down.

08:13.875 --> 08:14.666
Hey.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.249
Waist, 30 and 1/2.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.166
Pull this up, please. That's good.

08:18.167 --> 08:19.666
You asshole.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.125
Look front.

08:29.958 --> 08:32.207
Pay attention.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.914
Or you'll be seriously injured.

08:33.916 --> 08:34.916
Yes, Ma'am.

08:39.375 --> 08:39.916
Ma'am.

08:39.917 --> 08:41.541
Call a medic now!

08:42.375 --> 08:44.458
Stay still. Do not move.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.540
Hurry!

08:48.541 --> 08:53.749
As a commissioned officer out in the field,
you could face real danger.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.790
In preparation,
here at the Martial Arts Center,

08:55.791 --> 09:00.374
you'll choose one from Taekwondo,
Judo, Aikido, and Kendo

09:00.375 --> 09:02.958
and train for 4 years.

09:03.291 --> 09:04.458
Got it?

09:04.875 --> 09:06.500
Yes, Sir.

09:07.875 --> 09:09.624
I understand you're upset

09:09.625 --> 09:11.499
because two classmates have dropped out.

09:11.500 --> 09:15.665
But you're almost there. Keep going.

09:15.666 --> 09:16.500
Got it?

09:16.501 --> 09:17.790
Yes, Sir.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.082
Always answer loud and clear.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.208
Yes, Sir.

09:21.625 --> 09:24.207
Today is the final round of the training.

09:24.208 --> 09:26.457
It's the Mt. Buphwa race.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.665
According to our tradition,

09:28.666 --> 09:31.707
candidates who can run up and back down
the mountain in one hour

09:31.708 --> 09:34.457
will be accepted into the university.

09:34.458 --> 09:37.457
But those who fail will be denied entrance
for lack of physical competence.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.124
Those who fail to reach the top
will also be denied entrance.

09:40.125 --> 09:42.665
Run with all your might. Understood?

09:42.666 --> 09:43.750
Yes, Ma'am.

09:50.750 --> 09:51.791
Get set.

10:01.416 --> 10:03.458
Watch your step.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.666
Hey, help me.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.625
I'm sorry, man.

10:35.916 --> 10:37.333
You little shit.

10:39.666 --> 10:40.541
Geez.

10:42.458 --> 10:43.749
What're you doing here?

10:43.750 --> 10:44.291
Hey.

10:44.292 --> 10:46.750
Help me. I can't walk.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.915
Sorry but gotta go.

10:51.916 --> 10:52.750
Hey!

10:53.958 --> 10:55.874
I gave you my sausages.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.000
Sausages.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.499
I ate them because you wouldn't.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.749
You asked first.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.833
If you've eaten them, I wouldn't have.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.291
Shit, dude.

11:08.583 --> 11:11.458
Please help me. I wanna
get into the school.

11:12.625 --> 11:14.875
Damn it.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.208
Hey.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.540
I'll buy you a steak.

11:17.541 --> 11:18.333
Steak?

11:18.334 --> 11:20.708
My Dad is a big-timer
at Majang Meat Market.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.250
Korean beef.

11:22.708 --> 11:23.750
Perfect marbling.

11:23.916 --> 11:24.791
Perfect marbling.

11:25.083 --> 11:26.291
Perfect marbling.

11:27.375 --> 11:30.250
Climb on my back.

11:30.875 --> 11:31.583
Seriously?

11:31.583 --> 11:32.333
Come on.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.125
Let's go.

11:37.583 --> 11:38.666
Holy shit.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.958
What did you eat?

11:42.333 --> 11:43.499
You're freaking heavy.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.666
We don't have time. Hurry up.

11:46.125 --> 11:47.083
Let's go.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.166
Lift your head. Go over there.

11:54.333 --> 11:56.957
Jae-hang, how many is that?

11:56.958 --> 11:58.250
There are two left.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.166
What the...

12:03.166 --> 12:03.958
What?

12:04.333 --> 12:05.749
We passed the hour mark.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.476
Then go faster.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.291
You try, asshole.

12:09.416 --> 12:11.457
Dude, you ruined everything!

12:11.458 --> 12:13.249
You crazy asshole.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.207
I'm gonna throw you over there.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.125
I'm sorry.

12:19.166 --> 12:21.000
Downhill.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.500
Hurry up.

12:27.041 --> 12:27.875
Get down.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.125
What happened?

12:40.041 --> 12:44.416
I fell down running.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.124
And I sprained my ankle.

12:47.125 --> 12:49.790
Gi-jun Park assisted me all the way.

12:49.791 --> 12:54.250
Please accept him into the university.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.665
Plus I don't lack physical
competence either.

13:01.666 --> 13:02.666
Shut up.

13:02.667 --> 13:03.833
Yes, Ma'am.

13:07.375 --> 13:12.333
Raise your hand if you've seen
these two helping each other.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.125
Put your hand down.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.375
Raise your hand if you
haven't seen these two.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.750
Candidates, on the ground.

13:20.958 --> 13:22.208
Now!

13:24.791 --> 13:30.332
It's our job to help people in need.

13:30.333 --> 13:33.332
But you've neglected your classmates
when he was hurt.

13:33.333 --> 13:36.707
How can you call yourselves police
when you only care about yourselves?

13:36.708 --> 13:38.832
Even if you made it back on time,
you've all failed.

13:38.833 --> 13:39.916
Get up.

13:41.333 --> 13:44.708
You'll climb Mt. Buphwa again.

13:45.583 --> 13:46.458
Lead the way.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.750
Squad, move!

13:48.666 --> 13:49.625
Go!

13:55.333 --> 13:57.125
You two go to the infirmary.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.415
Did we pass?

13:59.416 --> 14:00.750
Now!

14:03.833 --> 14:05.666
Yes, Ma'am.

14:14.208 --> 14:15.958
Yes! We're good.

14:17.750 --> 14:18.500
Let's go.

14:18.501 --> 14:19.540
Oh, my foot.

14:19.541 --> 14:21.040
Where'd you go to high school?

14:21.041 --> 14:22.041
Seoul Science High School.

14:22.042 --> 14:25.499
Shouldn't you be at KAIST or something?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.124
(KAIST: Korean equivalent of MIT)
KAIST is dull.

14:27.125 --> 14:28.749
[KAIST: Korean equivalent of MIT]
I wanna do something unique.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.457
I think going to KAIST is pretty unique.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.290
All my friends went to KAIST.

14:32.291 --> 14:34.708
At my high school,
going to Police University is unique.

14:35.125 --> 14:38.041
You mean eccentric?

14:38.250 --> 14:40.082
Why'd you come here?

14:40.083 --> 14:42.999
Tuition is free here. My Mom has no money.

14:43.000 --> 14:43.750
What about your Dad?

14:43.751 --> 14:45.666
I was raised by a single Mom.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.500
That's a bit blunt.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.708
I'm not ashamed of it.

14:52.791 --> 14:53.791
You're right.

14:54.958 --> 14:57.499
So when are we gonna eat a steak?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.040
Whenever you wish.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.207
You wanna know something?

15:00.208 --> 15:01.125
What?

15:01.126 --> 15:03.583
I can eat like a food fighter.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.957
Well, we also own the butcher shop.

15:05.958 --> 15:07.625
Holy cow!

15:08.500 --> 15:09.916
Let's be best friends.

15:10.416 --> 15:11.291
All right.

15:13.875 --> 15:15.665
Are you a pervert?

15:15.666 --> 15:16.375
What do you mean?

15:16.376 --> 15:18.583
Don't rub it. Pound it.

15:19.583 --> 15:20.250
Let's go again.

15:20.251 --> 15:22.791
Don't disappoint me, bro. Come on.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.458
I do swear

15:31.666 --> 15:32.875
I do swear

15:33.291 --> 15:35.332
that I'll abide by
University's regulations.

15:35.333 --> 15:38.874
As a member of the university,
I'll uphold honor and pride

15:38.875 --> 15:42.082
and devote myself to my studies,

15:42.083 --> 15:44.041
fulfilling my duty.

15:44.458 --> 15:45.375
Hand down.

15:45.666 --> 15:48.041
To the University president. Present, arms.

15:48.166 --> 15:49.583
Salute!

15:50.041 --> 15:51.250
Salute!

16:02.166 --> 16:03.833
"2 Years Later"

16:22.041 --> 16:23.375
Man...

16:33.208 --> 16:34.166
Gi-jun.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.041
Yeah?

16:35.833 --> 16:37.750
I wanna wear civilian clothes.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.333
I hate the color green.

16:44.708 --> 16:46.665
Especially this shade of green.

16:46.666 --> 16:48.000
Hey, wait up.

16:49.666 --> 16:50.791
Wait up.

16:54.333 --> 16:59.000
"List 3 sources of investigation
Examine victim, evidence, crime scene."

17:04.083 --> 17:06.583
"Passion, tenacity,"

17:12.000 --> 17:14.267
"Big heart"

17:14.290 --> 17:15.375
Okay.

17:16.040 --> 17:22.499
Most abduction cases target
female adults and children under 13.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.499
Time is the most important factor
in abduction cases.

17:26.500 --> 17:31.332
A missing person's survival rate
falls significantly as the time passes.

17:31.333 --> 17:37.250
What do you call the time period that
a victim's most likely to be killed?

17:38.583 --> 17:39.666
Jae-ho.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.041
It's the golden time.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.125
That's for hospitals.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.041
It's the critical hours.

17:47.291 --> 17:48.458
Bingo.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.708
Listen carefully.

17:57.875 --> 18:04.332
For an adult female,
the critical hours are 7 hours afterwards.

18:04.333 --> 18:09.208
Statistically, 70% of the victims are
killed during that time.

18:09.458 --> 18:16.750
As I've said last week, today I'll teach
you very useful self-defense techniques.

18:16.958 --> 18:18.290
Any volunteers?

18:18.291 --> 18:19.375
I will.

18:26.625 --> 18:29.851
When a suspect attacks with a weapon.

18:29.875 --> 18:30.916
Slowly.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.541
Slowly!

18:35.916 --> 18:38.499
When a perpetrator attacks with a weapon,

18:38.500 --> 18:41.415
you cross your wrists and
trap the suspect's arm.

18:41.416 --> 18:43.166
Jump and boom!

18:45.916 --> 18:46.999
See that?

18:47.000 --> 18:47.750
Yes, Sir.

18:47.751 --> 18:48.874
His arm is stuck in between my wrists.

18:48.875 --> 18:49.458
Yes, Sir.

18:49.459 --> 18:53.458
Then you make a big semicircle
and bend his wrist.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.250
Now the attacker is bound
to drop his knife.

18:58.833 --> 18:59.916
See that?

19:00.208 --> 19:01.291
Yes, Sir.

19:01.416 --> 19:03.958
Now, you'll strike his nose with your palm.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.832
If the attacker's still standing,
play your last secret card.

19:09.833 --> 19:13.166
Strike the attacker's neck. Hi-yah!

19:21.625 --> 19:23.416
That looks truly helpful.

19:25.375 --> 19:26.750
A round of applause.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.458
Applause.

19:37.666 --> 19:38.767
Hee-yeol.

19:38.791 --> 19:40.749
What're you doing for Christmas?

19:40.750 --> 19:42.790
I'm going to an Internet Café with Gi-jun.

19:42.791 --> 19:45.000
I'm gonna hang out with my girlfriend.

19:45.458 --> 19:46.875
You don't have a girlfriend.

19:47.416 --> 19:48.458
I know.

19:51.416 --> 19:54.309
You stupid fools.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.250
What?

19:56.750 --> 19:58.500
What's this?

19:58.750 --> 19:59.874
My girlfriend.

19:59.875 --> 20:00.999
Where'd you meet her?

20:01.000 --> 20:06.625
I don't see why I have to tell you that.

20:07.291 --> 20:10.000
Nope, I don't think so.

20:11.666 --> 20:13.500
Gi-jun, make him talk.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.125
Let me interrogate.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.625
Where'd you meet her?

20:24.208 --> 20:25.041
Where?

20:25.042 --> 20:26.101
At a club.

20:26.125 --> 20:26.958
Which club?

20:26.959 --> 20:29.083
No way. I'm not telling you.

20:29.833 --> 20:30.875
Which club?

20:31.083 --> 20:32.832
Octagon.

20:32.833 --> 20:35.082
It's club Octagon.

20:35.083 --> 20:36.000
He met her at Octagon?

20:36.001 --> 20:37.665
Is it expensive to get in to Octagon?

20:37.666 --> 20:38.625
Octagon?

20:38.626 --> 20:41.249
$30 for a cover.
With drinks, it'll get seriously expensive.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.791
We won't order drinks.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.499
How will you pick up girls
without buying them drinks?

20:44.500 --> 20:48.207
Look. My Mom said that
women fall for men with cute smiles.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.416
Give me a smile.

20:52.833 --> 20:55.040
Wow, you've got lots of teeth.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.291
Shut your trap.

20:56.708 --> 20:59.208
Try showing only up to your cuspids.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.000
A little more.

21:01.958 --> 21:03.665
This is no good either.

21:03.666 --> 21:04.250
Darn you.

21:04.251 --> 21:05.915
But you're better looking than Jae-ho.

21:05.916 --> 21:08.000
Shit, he looks old.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.957
That just looked good.

21:09.958 --> 21:10.708
This?
Yeah.

21:10.709 --> 21:11.790
This looks good?
Yeah.

21:11.791 --> 21:12.957
Say that I'm better looking
than Jae-ho again.

21:12.958 --> 21:15.374
You're better looking than Jae-ho.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.582
Shit, he looks old.

21:16.583 --> 21:17.707
This?

21:17.708 --> 21:19.124
You got it.
Oh yeah?

21:19.125 --> 21:20.083
I got it, I got it.
You got it, you got it.

21:20.084 --> 21:21.666
We're ready to go.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.458
Bang!

21:28.333 --> 21:31.665
Hey, which one looks better?

21:31.666 --> 21:33.708
Shit. They're all crap.

21:34.583 --> 21:35.458
This one's better.

21:35.459 --> 21:36.832
What about me?

21:36.833 --> 21:37.833
Shit.

21:39.458 --> 21:41.500
It's a duffel coat and its twin.

21:42.708 --> 21:44.040
What're you gonna wear?

21:44.041 --> 21:45.583
I know what I'm gonna wear.

21:46.791 --> 21:48.374
Shit, is that from a donation bin?

21:48.375 --> 21:49.874
This is Cambridge Members.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.582
Cambridge or whatever it is.

21:51.583 --> 21:54.540
If you wear that, we won't get in
even with a $30 cover charge.

21:54.541 --> 21:56.583
Then what do I do? This is all I got.

21:59.208 --> 22:01.375
This ain't good. Let's get some help.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.207
No matter how hard you try,
you can't flip Gi-jun over.

22:03.208 --> 22:04.208
I can do it.

22:04.209 --> 22:05.332
Hi.
I can do it.

22:05.333 --> 22:06.041
Choose from here.

22:06.041 --> 22:07.017
Choose what?

22:07.041 --> 22:08.207
What?
Thanks.

22:08.208 --> 22:10.166
No, that's brand new!

22:10.541 --> 22:11.999
What're you looking at?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.874
Wait, I have to focus. Okay, got it.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.040
Let me borrow this for a day.

22:16.041 --> 22:16.791
Why should I?

22:16.791 --> 22:17.750
Because we're friends?

22:17.751 --> 22:19.541
Not good enough.

22:20.250 --> 22:21.374
What do you want?

22:21.375 --> 22:22.291
Me?

22:23.500 --> 22:25.249
During judo class,

22:25.250 --> 22:27.499
let me win by Ippon in front of everyone.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.666
Crazy ass...

22:30.000 --> 22:30.666
Okay.

22:30.666 --> 22:31.250
A shoulder-throw?

22:31.250 --> 22:31.791
Okay.

22:31.792 --> 22:32.916
Yahoo!

22:36.875 --> 22:38.166
You need cologne.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.583

Go. Your bus will leave.

A celebrity? Really?

23:39.751 --> 23:41.207
I think a celebrity is here.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.208
What line of work are you in?

26:26.791 --> 26:28.541
I'm a student.

26:29.375 --> 26:30.499
Are you studying abroad?

26:30.500 --> 26:32.375
No, at Police University.

26:33.458 --> 26:35.665
So you're a police officer?

26:35.666 --> 26:38.666
Yes. No, when I graduate.

26:44.875 --> 26:47.750
Why would you do that?

You really think we should become cops?

27:22.916 --> 27:24.166
What's wrong?

27:25.125 --> 27:26.708
I've been thinking.

27:27.458 --> 27:31.708
At least Jae-ho has a goal. We don't.

27:31.875 --> 27:35.208
I'm here because I'm penniless,
and you came here by accident.

27:38.250 --> 27:39.833
Dang.

27:44.458 --> 27:47.458
After we graduate, we'll be cops for life.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.791
I don't know if this is right.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.809

27:53.833 --> 27:57.332
Hi-yah, my ass. They teach useless stuff.

27:57.333 --> 28:00.000
I put up with it for 2 years already.
I can't drop out now.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.749

How about Italian? I'll buy.

28:07.500 --> 28:08.582
I know. I'm sorry.

Hee-yeol, you saw that?

28:39.583 --> 28:41.040
Yup. The pink one.

28:41.041 --> 28:44.832
I think God has given us one last chance.

28:44.833 --> 28:46.707
If she turns around right now,
it's a sign from God.

28:46.708 --> 28:48.000
Okay. Turn around.

28:48.333 --> 28:50.208
Turn around.

28:50.458 --> 28:53.083
Turn around.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.416
Turn...

28:54.541 --> 28:56.249
Holy.
Wow.

28:56.250 --> 28:58.457
What just happened?

28:58.458 --> 28:59.707
Holy geez.

28:59.708 --> 29:01.832
Jackpot! Sweet!
No way.

29:01.833 --> 29:04.708
She's gone. Let's go!

29:13.083 --> 29:15.415
If we follow her like this,
she might take it the wrong way.

29:15.416 --> 29:16.957
Then what should we do?
Let's just follow her.

29:16.958 --> 29:18.666
Don't hit me, asshole.

29:26.291 --> 29:28.540
It's now or never. Go ask her number.

29:28.541 --> 29:29.707
You do it.

29:29.708 --> 29:31.832
You're better looking than me. Come on.

29:31.833 --> 29:34.582
I agree with you on that,
but let's do rock-paper-scissors.

29:34.583 --> 29:36.415
Rock Paper Scissors! Play or you go.

29:36.416 --> 29:39.375
Rock Paper Scissors! Rock Paper Scissors!

29:40.416 --> 29:42.166
Don't do this now.

29:42.541 --> 29:43.625
Hurry up.

29:43.958 --> 29:45.333
One round only.

29:46.625 --> 29:48.541
Rock Paper Scissors!

29:57.416 --> 29:58.416
Scissors!

29:59.916 --> 30:02.583
Go get her number. Hurry up.

30:06.458 --> 30:08.000
What the...

30:23.041 --> 30:25.208
We almost got them!

30:30.458 --> 30:31.791
Stop!

31:13.166 --> 31:14.749
It's dialing. Pick up!

31:14.750 --> 31:16.583
Come here.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.976
Pick up, pick up!

31:19.000 --> 31:20.165
Please pick up.

31:20.166 --> 31:22.415
911, what's your emergency?
Hello?

31:22.416 --> 31:25.040
I just saw a girl being kidnapped.

31:25.041 --> 31:26.000
Yes.

31:26.458 --> 31:27.999
She looked like a college girl.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.582
Some men knocked her out

31:30.583 --> 31:32.666
and put her in a van.

31:33.541 --> 31:35.875
Yes, I witnessed it myself.

31:36.125 --> 31:37.874
Yes. Excuse me?

31:37.875 --> 31:40.041
No, I don't know her.

31:41.125 --> 31:42.332
The license plate number?

31:42.333 --> 31:43.750
You know it?

31:44.416 --> 31:46.999
37GU8338, a green Starex van.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.500
We got them.
We can do this.

31:51.375 --> 31:52.333
Yes!

31:52.541 --> 31:54.041
Pardon?
What's wrong?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.540
No way. I have a really good memory.

31:57.541 --> 32:00.457
Then what about 8838?

32:00.458 --> 32:01.833
That's right. Hurry!

32:02.625 --> 32:03.500
Pardon?

32:04.500 --> 32:07.125
Then what about 8383?

32:07.291 --> 32:08.250
Shit.

32:08.416 --> 32:10.958
Pardon? Oh, okay.

32:11.666 --> 32:13.207
What did he say?

32:13.208 --> 32:13.833
They can't find it.

32:13.833 --> 32:14.458
What?

32:14.708 --> 32:17.083
They want us to wait
here for the patrol car.

32:17.375 --> 32:18.457
How long will that take?

32:18.458 --> 32:19.166
About 10 minutes?

32:19.166 --> 32:19.958
10 minutes?

32:20.625 --> 32:21.250
Let's go.

32:21.250 --> 32:22.166
Go where?

32:22.167 --> 32:25.790
We'll still need to go to the station
to make a report.

32:25.791 --> 32:26.915
In 10 minutes,

32:26.916 --> 32:29.458
we can go to Gangnam Police Station.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.457
Let's save time. Come on.

32:31.458 --> 32:32.041
Okay!

32:32.042 --> 32:33.416
Taxi!

32:41.375 --> 32:42.583
Salute.

32:43.333 --> 32:44.666
Salute.

32:45.375 --> 32:46.833
Salute.

32:47.541 --> 32:49.166
Thank you.

32:50.166 --> 32:51.415
We're from Police University.

32:51.416 --> 32:52.833
We're here to report a crime.

32:56.291 --> 32:57.559
Good evening.

32:57.583 --> 32:59.124
Which floor is Missing Persons Unit on?

32:59.125 --> 33:00.665
They're getting ready to be dispatched.

33:00.666 --> 33:01.416
Pardon?

33:01.416 --> 33:02.416
There they are.

33:02.417 --> 33:05.375
Sir, they're here for Missing Persons Unit.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.375
What can I do for you?

33:06.376 --> 33:09.165
We're Police University students
and want to report a crime.

33:09.166 --> 33:10.582
What class are you in?

33:10.583 --> 33:11.416
Pardon?

33:11.750 --> 33:13.416
We're Class of 2017.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.416
I was Class of 1999.

33:15.916 --> 33:16.999
Hello, Sir.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.582
So what was the crime?

33:18.583 --> 33:22.374
We saw a woman getting kidnapped
near Nonhyun station, 30 minutes ago.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.582
Are you sure?

33:23.583 --> 33:25.207
Yes, Sir.
You knew her?

33:25.208 --> 33:26.208
No, Sir.

33:26.209 --> 33:29.749
I see. We're on the move on
a Chief's special order.

33:29.750 --> 33:32.082
Some business mogul's
grandson went missing.

33:32.083 --> 33:34.457
I'll lead the initial investigation
and be back asap. Wait here.

33:34.458 --> 33:35.749
Excuse me, Sir.

33:35.750 --> 33:38.207
For adult women, since the critical hours

33:38.208 --> 33:40.415
occur during the first 7 hours of
abduction, - Captain, please hurry.

33:40.416 --> 33:42.082
We were taught to start investigating asap.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.249
That's right. You were taught correctly.

33:43.250 --> 33:45.707
But the Chief's order comes first.

33:45.708 --> 33:47.625
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.416
What do we do now?

33:57.750 --> 34:00.291
It'll be too late when he gets back.

34:01.125 --> 34:03.291
Then what do we do? We can't go looking.

34:04.916 --> 34:05.916
Seriously?

34:05.916 --> 34:06.708
Yeah.

34:07.041 --> 34:08.915
We're the only ones who
know she's kidnapped.

34:08.916 --> 34:10.833
She could die without us.

34:11.333 --> 34:13.958
That's true.

34:14.166 --> 34:16.915
But we can't track her phone
or see the CCTV tapes.

34:16.916 --> 34:17.916
What can we do?

34:17.917 --> 34:20.415
I know you're smart,
especially at a time like this.

34:20.416 --> 34:23.625
Think of something you've
learned from school.

34:28.458 --> 34:29.291
Hey.

34:30.041 --> 34:32.541
Should we use the 3
sources of investigation?

34:35.958 --> 34:37.373
How do we do that?

34:37.375 --> 34:38.623
3 sources of investigation.

34:38.625 --> 34:41.415
Examine victim, evidence, crime scene.

34:41.416 --> 34:42.791
Let's do that.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.708
What's wrong?

34:48.833 --> 34:50.081
Nothing. Keep going.

34:50.083 --> 34:54.706
We can't examine the victim
because we don't know the victim.

34:54.708 --> 34:56.748
We can't examine evidence
because there's no evidence.

34:56.750 --> 34:58.916
So we examine the crime scene.

34:59.166 --> 35:00.207
That's true, but...

35:00.208 --> 35:01.249
Let's go back there.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.415
I don't think we'll find anything.

35:02.416 --> 35:04.416
Even if we don't, we should try.

35:08.458 --> 35:10.375
Okay. Let's go.

35:10.583 --> 35:11.541
Come on.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.375
Here, here.

35:18.458 --> 35:19.916
This is it. Thank you.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.083
Wasn't it this way?

35:22.083 --> 35:22.791
Yeah.

35:27.416 --> 35:29.166
I think we're almost there.

35:32.125 --> 35:33.000
I think it's here.

35:33.001 --> 35:35.958
Hey, the van was here.

35:36.916 --> 35:38.250
Here?
Yeah.

35:41.291 --> 35:44.457
So if the van was waiting here,
it's likely that it was premeditated.

35:44.458 --> 35:47.750
If it was premeditated, it's likely
that they're habitual offenders.

35:48.541 --> 35:50.875
Which lowers the chance
of us catching them.

35:53.041 --> 35:54.583
You're right.

35:57.583 --> 35:58.851
Hey, look.

35:58.875 --> 36:02.666
Wasn't the pink girl carrying that earlier?

36:02.833 --> 36:03.375
Yeah.

36:03.376 --> 36:04.500
Right?

36:09.250 --> 36:10.583
What's wrong?

36:10.791 --> 36:11.958
You open it.

36:16.791 --> 36:18.458
I think it's alive.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.625
What's this? Blood!

36:21.916 --> 36:23.707
It's Topokki.

36:23.708 --> 36:24.666
Is it?

36:24.667 --> 36:26.749
That's a lot of Topokki.
Maybe enough for 4 people.

36:26.750 --> 36:27.958
Who cares?

36:28.250 --> 36:31.874
You know of anyone
who freezes Topokki for later?

36:31.875 --> 36:33.707
I've never done that.

36:33.708 --> 36:36.374
It means she has people to share at home.

36:36.375 --> 36:38.208
Kickass lifestyle inference!

36:40.291 --> 36:43.040
Only if we knew her
address, we'd find more.

36:43.041 --> 36:44.415
There's not even a receipt.

36:44.416 --> 36:49.082
We can't find her house,
but we might find the Topokki stand.

36:49.083 --> 36:51.624
Because Topokki gets mushy easily
so people buy them near homes.

36:51.625 --> 36:53.416
Freaking forensics.

36:55.583 --> 36:56.625
Let's go.

37:05.250 --> 37:10.166
Yes, iPhone 6. Pink.

37:12.583 --> 37:13.916
What do you mean?

37:14.375 --> 37:18.041
Mr. Hwang, how could you do this to me?

37:18.625 --> 37:21.040
You paid $300 last time.

37:21.041 --> 37:24.083
I want $500 for this one
or you won't get the girl.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.375
Is this from your stand?

37:30.916 --> 37:32.749
It's too sweet.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.416
It's not mine.

37:34.875 --> 37:37.207
Are there many Topokki stands around here?

37:37.208 --> 37:40.249
There are a few,
but they're all about to close.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.125
Really?

37:41.583 --> 37:42.291
Let's hurry.

37:42.291 --> 37:43.041
Thank you.

37:43.208 --> 37:44.041
Thank you.

37:46.250 --> 37:48.540
Where do we go? Let's go this way.

37:48.541 --> 37:49.500
Okay.

37:49.666 --> 37:50.707
Excuse me.

37:50.708 --> 37:53.125
Are there any Topokki shops near here?

37:53.333 --> 37:55.624
There's one Kukde Topokki shop over there.

37:55.625 --> 37:56.458
Over there?

37:56.459 --> 37:57.726
Thank you.

37:57.750 --> 37:59.833
Did you sell these Topokki?

38:01.375 --> 38:05.583
Our scallions are rectangular,
but these are stringy.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.416
It's not ours.

38:09.541 --> 38:11.790
I'm sorry, but do you
know where this is from?

38:11.791 --> 38:14.583
How should I know? Try another place.

38:15.208 --> 38:17.059
Okay. Right?

38:17.083 --> 38:17.916
Okay.

38:18.541 --> 38:20.875
Stop interfering with my business
and please leave.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.541
We're sorry.

38:22.833 --> 38:23.875
Let's go.

38:24.416 --> 38:26.207
No, it's not ours.
Okay.

38:26.208 --> 38:27.958
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

38:30.125 --> 38:31.374
Is this a mistake?

38:31.375 --> 38:32.625
Where to?

38:33.083 --> 38:34.249
Sorry.
We're sorry.

38:34.250 --> 38:36.375
Let's go over here.
Come on.

38:37.083 --> 38:38.000
Hello, Ma'am.

38:38.001 --> 38:41.457
Could you please see
if this Topokki is from your stand?

38:41.458 --> 38:42.208
I don't know anything.

38:42.209 --> 38:44.458
Excuse me, Ma'am.

38:50.625 --> 38:52.875
It might be closed already.

38:55.375 --> 38:58.915
Should we call Prof. Yang?
He worked in Serious Crime Unit.

38:58.916 --> 39:02.207
He'll be more upset
if he knows what we're doing.

39:02.208 --> 39:03.958
Gi-jun, listen.

39:04.291 --> 39:06.666
Can we examine evidence right now?

39:07.166 --> 39:08.083
No.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.040
Then can we examine the victim?

39:10.041 --> 39:11.041
No.

39:11.291 --> 39:13.041
So calling Prof. Yang

39:14.375 --> 39:16.250
would be a bad idea, right?

39:16.958 --> 39:18.957
I know this isn't the
right time to say this.

39:18.958 --> 39:21.707
But you know what I wrote
as the 3 sources of investigation?

39:21.708 --> 39:22.375
What?

39:22.376 --> 39:24.625
Passion, tenacity, big heart.

39:28.583 --> 39:29.666
I got it wrong.

39:30.416 --> 39:31.416
Are you a moron?

39:31.417 --> 39:32.500
I think so.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.082
Come on. We can find it.

39:38.083 --> 39:39.083
Okay.

39:39.084 --> 39:40.165
There must be one.

39:40.166 --> 39:41.458
There must be.

39:43.666 --> 39:44.500
Hello.

39:44.501 --> 39:45.708
No one's here.

39:47.625 --> 39:48.583
The scallion!

39:50.000 --> 39:50.833
You're right.

39:50.834 --> 39:52.666
We found it.
This is it.

39:52.875 --> 39:55.374
Hello, handsome boys.

39:55.375 --> 39:57.290
Is this Topokki from your stand?

39:57.291 --> 39:58.208
Yes.

39:58.500 --> 40:01.207
Then do you remember the
girl who bought this?

40:01.208 --> 40:03.832
I have a lot takeout customers.

40:03.833 --> 40:07.790
She was wearing a pink parka and
had a very small face.

40:07.791 --> 40:09.208
Like this big.

40:10.666 --> 40:14.665
She sounds like the girl,
who comes here often at midnight.

40:14.666 --> 40:15.625
Tall.

40:15.626 --> 40:16.790
That's her!

40:16.791 --> 40:17.291
My goodness.

40:17.292 --> 40:19.915
You wouldn't know her house, would you?

40:19.916 --> 40:21.583
No.

40:23.625 --> 40:26.166
Oh, I know where she works.

40:27.708 --> 40:29.790
7-Eleven over there.

40:29.791 --> 40:31.499
I met her there once.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.000
I saw her coming up
from the building's basement in front.

40:34.958 --> 40:37.333
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

40:39.791 --> 40:41.291
Across.

40:41.583 --> 40:42.541
The basement.

40:42.541 --> 40:43.500
This is the place.

40:46.208 --> 40:47.083
Gi-jun.

40:47.083 --> 40:47.833
Yeah?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.040
She must work at the ear-cleaning salon.

40:50.041 --> 40:51.332
What's that?

40:51.333 --> 40:52.915
You rest your head in a girl's lap
while she cleans your ear.

40:52.916 --> 40:54.457
If you work her up to it,
she'd let you touch her boobs.

40:54.458 --> 40:55.375
Holy mother.

40:56.500 --> 40:57.540
How do you know about this?

40:57.541 --> 41:00.125
In high school,
my friends wanted to go so I googled it.

41:00.666 --> 41:01.625
You went.

41:01.958 --> 41:03.499
I didn't go
because they don't sterilize ear picks.

41:03.500 --> 41:04.392
You did go, loser.

41:04.416 --> 41:05.457
I did not, loser.

41:05.458 --> 41:06.208
You so did.

41:06.208 --> 41:06.916
Shush.

41:07.625 --> 41:10.625
If we get caught in this shady place,
we'll be expelled.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.457
But we don't go in, we'll never find her.

41:12.458 --> 41:14.082
But we could get expelled.

41:14.083 --> 41:15.041
Then don't get caught.

41:15.042 --> 41:16.499
One keeps watch while the other goes in.

41:16.500 --> 41:17.291
I'll keep watch.

41:17.291 --> 41:18.083
No.

41:18.084 --> 41:19.916
I don't want to either.

41:20.041 --> 41:20.708
Do rock-paper-scissors.

41:20.709 --> 41:23.684
Is that all you know?
Play or go. Rock Paper Scissors!

41:23.708 --> 41:24.708
Get in there.

41:24.875 --> 41:26.332
Please just this once. Two out of three.

41:26.333 --> 41:27.684
So damn bitter.

41:27.708 --> 41:28.957
Rock Paper Scissors!

41:28.958 --> 41:29.541
Get in there.

41:29.542 --> 41:30.582
You always play rock.

41:30.583 --> 41:33.375
Idiot, it's you who
always play scissors. Go!

41:35.250 --> 41:36.291
Shit.

42:22.708 --> 42:23.875
Come on in.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.458
Okay.

42:34.125 --> 42:35.915
Go to Room 3.

42:35.916 --> 42:37.915
I'm actually here to find someone.

42:37.916 --> 42:39.290
Room 3.

42:39.291 --> 42:40.250
Yes, Sir.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.416
That looks yummy.

43:27.208 --> 43:30.540
It's just ramen noodles. Geez.

43:30.541 --> 43:32.833
Hold back the urge. I can do it.

43:33.208 --> 43:34.291
I must.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.041
Wow, sausage.

43:38.333 --> 43:40.791
That's my favorite.

43:44.666 --> 43:46.000
I can keep watch from inside.

43:54.833 --> 43:56.374
Who are you looking for?

43:56.375 --> 43:57.833
She's got a small face.

43:58.791 --> 44:01.958
I don't know her name.

44:08.208 --> 44:09.541
What about her body?

44:10.625 --> 44:11.833
She's tall.

44:15.625 --> 44:16.791
You know her?

44:18.791 --> 44:19.875
What the...

44:24.583 --> 44:25.916
Oh my god.

44:26.375 --> 44:27.875
It's so good.

44:30.500 --> 44:31.833
I need sausage.

44:39.666 --> 44:42.749
How cute! Are you in the army?

44:42.750 --> 44:43.708
Yes.

44:50.625 --> 44:51.958
What're you doing?

44:53.208 --> 44:54.791
The text...

44:56.416 --> 44:57.333
Sit.

44:58.291 --> 44:59.458
Yes, Ma'am.

45:04.041 --> 45:06.666
I'll start.

45:08.083 --> 45:10.291
Lie down. What's wrong?

45:12.125 --> 45:16.333
Wait, wait. Did you sterilize the ear pick?

45:17.583 --> 45:19.375
No, does it need to be?

45:20.625 --> 45:21.541
No, Ma'am.

45:21.542 --> 45:24.458
Okay then. Relax.

45:31.500 --> 45:34.333
Uh oh. That isn't good.

45:43.416 --> 45:44.666
Oh man.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.541
Hey, pigs!

45:53.166 --> 45:54.958
Sir, just ignore him.

45:55.625 --> 45:57.749
Kids like him end up criminals.

45:57.750 --> 45:58.790
I think he's drunk.

45:58.791 --> 45:59.958
Hello, pigs!

46:00.166 --> 46:00.750
Pigs.

46:00.750 --> 46:01.666
Sir?

46:02.875 --> 46:03.916
Hey, pigs.

46:06.416 --> 46:07.375
Pigs!

46:07.500 --> 46:08.750
You come here.

46:09.250 --> 46:10.166
Stop right there.

46:10.167 --> 46:11.791
Why would I do that?

46:14.125 --> 46:15.041
Hey!

46:15.750 --> 46:17.708
You guys need to work out.

46:19.625 --> 46:21.541
Stop, stop, stop!

46:22.375 --> 46:24.207
I'm gonna go in deeper.

46:24.208 --> 46:25.041
Okay, Ma'am.

46:27.416 --> 46:29.416
That's a big one. Stay still.

46:42.125 --> 46:43.541
Is he Captain America or something?

46:43.916 --> 46:48.333
I think he realized his mistakes.

46:48.583 --> 46:53.000
Justice rains from above. You, pigs.

46:53.541 --> 46:54.458
He realized?

46:54.625 --> 46:55.583
Uh oh.

46:57.833 --> 46:58.750
Stop right there.

46:58.751 --> 46:59.958
Stop, you little punk!

47:03.083 --> 47:07.125
You should come here more often.
Look at all these.

47:07.291 --> 47:08.208
Okay.

47:10.083 --> 47:13.874
You know what?
I'm not here to get my ear cleaned.

47:13.875 --> 47:14.791
What?

47:20.500 --> 47:22.500
Then why're you here?

47:23.916 --> 47:25.500
Should I tell you?

47:27.166 --> 47:28.624
Oh my goodness.

47:28.625 --> 47:30.582
Dear Mama, get well.

47:30.583 --> 47:31.666
What's wrong?

47:35.291 --> 47:38.082
A few hours ago, my friend and I saw

47:38.083 --> 47:41.915
some men knocking out a girl
and kidnapping her.

47:41.916 --> 47:44.207
Then I found out that she works here.

47:44.208 --> 47:45.499
Wait. Who?

47:45.500 --> 47:46.958
She has a small face.

47:47.333 --> 47:49.499
She's about 5'7".

47:49.500 --> 47:51.416
Her hair is about this long.

47:51.875 --> 47:55.291
We got a lot of girls like that.
Anything else?

47:56.333 --> 47:59.750
I think she left work
around midnight tonight.

48:02.333 --> 48:03.832
Is it Yun-Jung?
Yun-Jung.

48:03.833 --> 48:05.499
Her hair color?
Brown.

48:05.500 --> 48:08.790
Oh my. I think it's Yun-Jung.

48:08.791 --> 48:10.749
What should we do?

48:10.750 --> 48:12.166
Please calm down.

48:14.166 --> 48:17.000
You know her address?

48:17.541 --> 48:20.165
No, she ran away from home a long time ago.

48:20.166 --> 48:21.000
She ran away?

48:21.001 --> 48:22.791
Yeah, she's 17.

48:24.083 --> 48:26.582
Isn't it illegal to hire a minor?

48:26.583 --> 48:28.124
I'm working illegally too.

48:28.125 --> 48:30.249
This whole place is illegal.

48:30.250 --> 48:33.791
So you don't know where Yun-Jung lives.

48:34.125 --> 48:38.500
She told me she lives with
her runaway friends nearby.

48:40.166 --> 48:41.415
Should I ask the other girls?

48:41.416 --> 48:42.291
Yes, please.

48:42.291 --> 48:42.833
Okay.

48:45.750 --> 48:46.999
64 Nonhyun-ro 27.

48:47.000 --> 48:47.791
Geez.

48:47.791 --> 48:48.791
What the heck?

48:48.792 --> 48:50.165
Run.

48:50.166 --> 48:51.249
What's wrong?
Run fast!

48:51.250 --> 48:52.000
I got her address.

48:52.000 --> 48:52.958
Run for now.

48:52.959 --> 48:55.166
What's with the patrol car?
Just run.

48:56.291 --> 48:57.375
What's going on?

49:01.750 --> 49:02.833
Is this it?

49:04.250 --> 49:05.625
Watch your head.

49:05.875 --> 49:07.500
I think this is the place.

49:17.875 --> 49:19.041
Hello.

49:20.375 --> 49:21.583
Someone's home.

49:26.666 --> 49:27.666
Who are you?

49:28.708 --> 49:30.541
Hello.

49:30.791 --> 49:33.541
I was told that Yun-Jung lives here.

49:34.750 --> 49:36.291
Who are you?

49:36.416 --> 49:39.082
We're from Police University.

49:39.083 --> 49:42.125
We saw Yun-Jung get kidnapped.

49:45.458 --> 49:47.291
Is someone else in there?

49:49.041 --> 49:50.374
Okay. I'll open the door.

49:50.375 --> 49:51.208
Okay.

49:52.875 --> 49:53.833
Gun-young, is Yun-Jung okay?

49:53.834 --> 49:55.208
Shut the fuck up.

49:59.625 --> 50:00.833
You hear something?

50:02.250 --> 50:03.625
Hey, open up.

50:08.666 --> 50:09.916
Pull it.

50:10.750 --> 50:12.125
He ran away through there.

50:14.291 --> 50:15.333
Go that way.

50:15.791 --> 50:16.875
I'll go outside.

50:22.333 --> 50:23.166
I'll go this way.

50:23.166 --> 50:24.041
I'll go there.

51:19.833 --> 51:21.000
Shit.

51:23.541 --> 51:24.791
Shit.

51:25.958 --> 51:27.208
Did you do that?

51:28.666 --> 51:29.500
Yeah.

51:29.750 --> 51:31.333
Jackpot.

51:32.375 --> 51:34.166
What do we do?

51:36.666 --> 51:38.125
This actually works.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.749
Do as you were taught.

51:40.750 --> 51:42.166
As we were taught?

51:46.875 --> 51:48.500
Come here.

51:52.333 --> 51:53.750
Why'd you run?

51:53.916 --> 51:55.999
Because you were coming after me.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.207
You must've run
because you've done something bad.

51:58.208 --> 51:59.999
I didn't do anything bad.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.416
Please tell me the passcode.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.458
Don't be so polite.

52:05.708 --> 52:07.374
Tell me the passcode, biatch.

52:07.375 --> 52:08.375
Yeah, asshole.

52:08.376 --> 52:09.665
This really hurts.

52:09.666 --> 52:10.958
Tell me now.

52:14.916 --> 52:16.083
Stupid ass.

52:16.333 --> 52:17.540
How do you know Yun-Jung?

52:17.541 --> 52:19.041
This really hurts a lot.

52:19.333 --> 52:20.749
I'll tell you everything
if you let me loose.

52:20.750 --> 52:22.541
I wired $1,000.

52:22.750 --> 52:25.125
You sold off Yun-Jung, didn't you?

52:29.000 --> 52:30.666
I don't know anything.

52:31.416 --> 52:33.750
I just told them her name.

52:34.125 --> 52:36.207
To who? To Gun-ho?

52:36.208 --> 52:38.624
He said he'll pay for runaway kids.

52:38.625 --> 52:40.415
Who is Gun-ho?

52:40.416 --> 52:42.375
He's just a guy I know.

52:42.666 --> 52:44.207
Where's he right now?

52:44.208 --> 52:45.457
Where is he?

52:45.458 --> 52:48.041
Lamb kebabs. In Daerim-dong.

52:48.208 --> 52:50.165
I have his business card in my wallet.

52:50.166 --> 52:51.458
Find his wallet.

52:53.875 --> 52:55.041
Come here, asshole.

52:55.541 --> 52:56.958
He's loaded.

52:57.208 --> 52:58.790
What're they doing to the kids?

52:58.791 --> 52:59.957
I don't know.

52:59.958 --> 53:02.499
You don't know what they'll do,
yet you still sold them off?

53:02.500 --> 53:04.666
I need money.

53:04.958 --> 53:06.708
Asshole.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.332
No matter how poor you are.
Have you no shame?

53:10.333 --> 53:11.250
Gi-jun.

53:12.208 --> 53:13.416
Hegang Lamb Kebab.

53:14.083 --> 53:15.000
Hegang?

53:15.001 --> 53:17.207
Let's go talk to the kids
at Yun-jung's place.

53:17.208 --> 53:18.540
Get statements from acquaintances.

53:18.541 --> 53:21.541
It'll be dangerous for them
to stay there tonight.

53:29.083 --> 53:30.458
I bet you're hungry.

53:30.750 --> 53:35.375
We need to ask some questions
about Yun-Jung. Can we come in?

53:37.083 --> 53:39.166
How did you meet Yun-Jung?

53:40.083 --> 53:41.915
We met at the runaway shelter.

53:41.916 --> 53:42.833
When?

53:44.291 --> 53:45.625
About a year ago.

53:48.083 --> 53:50.041
Why did Yun-Jung run away from home?

53:50.416 --> 53:52.832
She said her stepfather
beat her all the time.

53:52.833 --> 53:54.875
She said sometimes he beat her unconscious.

53:59.333 --> 54:00.791
Where's Yun-Jung?

54:03.583 --> 54:08.958
Some bad men knocked her down
with a bat and kidnapped her.

54:18.041 --> 54:19.958
Oh, Yun-Jung.

54:20.541 --> 54:21.666
Oh no.

54:22.416 --> 54:25.041
How could you tell them that, crazy ass?

54:25.916 --> 54:27.601
I thought they should know.

54:27.625 --> 54:28.915
Is she hurt badly?

54:28.916 --> 54:31.249
What? No.

54:31.250 --> 54:32.707
She wasn't hurt too badly.

54:32.708 --> 54:35.916
We're looking for her so don't worry.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.249
Mister.

54:38.250 --> 54:40.249
I can't live without her.

54:40.250 --> 54:42.374
Could you please find her?

54:42.375 --> 54:43.790
Please?

54:43.791 --> 54:45.708
Please save her.

54:53.458 --> 54:54.375
Girls.

54:56.458 --> 55:01.458
We'll find Yun-Jung no matter what.

55:03.125 --> 55:04.250
So don't cry.

55:18.666 --> 55:20.333
Take this.

55:20.833 --> 55:22.207
And get out of here.

55:22.208 --> 55:24.082
Find some place warm to sleep.

55:24.083 --> 55:26.291
When we find Yun-Jung, we'll call you.

55:31.375 --> 55:32.267
I see a taxi.

55:32.291 --> 55:33.416
Taxi, taxi!

55:34.208 --> 55:35.083
Get in.

55:36.625 --> 55:37.750
Hello.

55:38.125 --> 55:39.415
To Daerim-dong, please.

55:39.416 --> 55:40.208
Where in Daerim-dong?

55:40.209 --> 55:41.791
Here's the address.

55:46.208 --> 55:47.665
For police to work,

55:47.666 --> 55:50.457
someone needs to report a crime,
or police need orders from above.

55:50.458 --> 55:51.458
That's right.

55:51.459 --> 55:54.665
But no one'll report a crime
when a runaway is kidnapped.

55:54.666 --> 55:58.332
Family won't know she's missing
because she's already gone.

55:58.333 --> 56:02.250
Runaway friends are afraid of cops
so they won't call in.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.125
They calculated the target,
place and everything else.

56:06.458 --> 56:07.833
They're smart.

56:09.333 --> 56:13.708
What do you think
they're doing to the kidnap victims?

56:16.750 --> 56:18.166
Human trafficking.

56:23.500 --> 56:25.458
Sir, please hurry.

56:52.958 --> 56:54.374
Fucking bitch.

56:54.375 --> 56:56.041
Get her.
Okay.

57:00.125 --> 57:01.666
Please don't kill me.

57:08.083 --> 57:09.333
Medicine time.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.125
Student ID: Yun-Jung Lee.

57:27.125 --> 57:29.666
Guys, this is Daerim-dong.

57:44.083 --> 57:46.625
I can't believe this is Korea.

57:47.083 --> 57:49.625
Look at the signs. This is China.

57:49.916 --> 57:51.625
I've never seen anything like it.

57:52.958 --> 57:53.875
What the...

57:57.791 --> 57:58.833
You guys.

57:59.041 --> 58:00.957
Only Korean Chinese live here.

58:00.958 --> 58:02.916
Many stabbing incidents happen at night.

58:03.041 --> 58:07.000
There are many ruthless illegals that
cops won't even touch.

58:07.375 --> 58:09.916
You shouldn't walk around if unnecessary.

58:10.666 --> 58:11.875
Thank you.

58:20.166 --> 58:22.333
This is the place. Thank you.

58:22.583 --> 58:23.708
Thank you.

58:27.791 --> 58:28.375
Right?

58:28.375 --> 58:29.166
Yup.

58:30.583 --> 58:31.625
Let's go.

58:48.416 --> 58:51.374
We close at 4 am. Order from 2 servings.

58:51.375 --> 58:52.375
Okay.

58:55.375 --> 58:57.041
He's pretty good.

58:59.541 --> 59:01.290
This game is fixed.
Give me the phone.

59:01.291 --> 59:02.166
What?

59:02.167 --> 59:03.332
The phone.

59:03.333 --> 59:04.541
It's not fixed.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.375
But how come I keep losing?

59:13.375 --> 59:15.250
Stupid moron.

59:16.041 --> 59:18.000
Not yours. The asshole's.

59:28.291 --> 59:29.208
Gun-ho.

59:31.916 --> 59:34.625
If I lose again, this game is fixed.

59:36.500 --> 59:37.874
That's our guy.
That's him.

59:37.875 --> 59:40.165
You sure the game isn't fixed?

59:40.166 --> 59:41.125
What do we do now?

59:42.083 --> 59:43.375
First, let's order.

59:49.416 --> 59:50.625
Stupid ass.

59:59.083 --> 01:00:01.207
This place is expensive. Shall we go?

01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:02.249
Okay, let's go.

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:03.934
Let's go.
Who are you?

01:00:03.958 --> 01:00:06.000
Where's Gun-young?

01:00:06.666 --> 01:00:08.666
Where's Gun-young?

01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:14.250
Why do you have Gun-young's phone?

01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:17.083
Who are you?

01:00:17.458 --> 01:00:19.457
Who the fuck are you?

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:22.333
Who are you?

01:00:34.291 --> 01:00:35.333
Hee-yeol!

01:01:01.333 --> 01:01:02.415
Gi-jun, you okay?

01:01:02.416 --> 01:01:03.083
Yeah.

01:01:03.084 --> 01:01:04.500
We kick ass.

01:01:05.416 --> 01:01:06.625
Let's get him to talk.

01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:10.457
Where's Yun-Jung?

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:11.250
Start talking.

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:12.125
Tell us now.

01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:15.333
I'll never tell you, shithead.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.082
Crazy ass, you think this is a joke?

01:01:18.083 --> 01:01:19.083
Hold him down.

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:19.833
Okay.

01:01:24.041 --> 01:01:25.666
I said, talk.

01:01:29.125 --> 01:01:30.476
Hell yeah.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.332
What're you gonna do with that?

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:33.416
I don't know.

01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:36.833
Start talking now.

01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:39.332
What're you poking me with?

01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:40.915
I won't tell you either, asshole.

01:01:40.916 --> 01:01:42.958
Let's use words.

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:46.499
Words? He's freaking vicious and ignorant.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.874
I'm freaking ignorant.

01:01:47.875 --> 01:01:50.125
I can stick this all the
way up to your mouth.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.249
I won't tell you a thing, shithead.

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:57.625
Crazy ass.

01:01:58.541 --> 01:01:59.875
Then die.

01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:03.416
Hurry up.

01:02:04.333 --> 01:02:06.500
Which way? Talk now.

01:02:07.416 --> 01:02:08.999
Hurry up.
Talk!

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.208
This way.

01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:15.750
We have a situation at Hegang.
We need to go now.

01:02:15.875 --> 01:02:16.458
What?

01:02:16.459 --> 01:02:18.083
Gun-ho was taken.

01:02:19.208 --> 01:02:20.041
Everyone, up!

01:02:20.042 --> 01:02:22.250
Get out now. Hurry up!

01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:32.666
Is this the right place?

01:02:37.583 --> 01:02:38.833
Is this the right key?

01:02:42.833 --> 01:02:43.791
Go up.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.457
I'll go upstairs.

01:02:50.458 --> 01:02:51.333
Okay.

01:03:37.333 --> 01:03:38.250
Mister.

01:03:38.251 --> 01:03:39.500
Please save me.

01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:40.916
Mister.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.101
I'm in here. Please help me.

01:03:44.125 --> 01:03:45.583
Save me.

01:03:45.875 --> 01:03:47.375
Get us out of here.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:59.500
What is this place? What're you up to?

01:03:59.916 --> 01:04:01.500
We're getting eggs.

01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:06.333
We give the girls shots and get their eggs.

01:04:08.666 --> 01:04:09.708
Gi-jun.

01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:12.708
You need to come here now.

01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:13.750
Okay.

01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:18.416
Don't worry.

01:04:18.958 --> 01:04:20.749
Even after we get their eggs out,

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:23.000
you can still screw them.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.541
Fucking asshole.

01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:33.957
This room?

01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:36.374
No, all these rooms.

01:04:36.375 --> 01:04:37.083
What?

01:04:37.084 --> 01:04:38.500
Open this door.

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:56.041
She's burning up.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.124
Isn't this blood?

01:05:00.125 --> 01:05:01.125
Blood?

01:05:04.458 --> 01:05:05.416
Shit.

01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:07.250
What do we do?

01:05:07.541 --> 01:05:08.665
Let's take her to the hospital.

01:05:08.666 --> 01:05:10.249
What about the other girls?

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:11.749
Let's take her to the hospital first.

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:14.166
Let's come back with the police.

01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:16.166
Be careful.

01:05:19.291 --> 01:05:20.250
Let's go.

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:29.500
Hello, shitface.

01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:37.333
Head!

01:05:41.416 --> 01:05:42.583
Gi-jun, go.

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:44.166
Hurry and go.

01:05:44.791 --> 01:05:46.125
I'll hurry back.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:48.291
Don't come near.

01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:49.708
Get back!

01:05:54.833 --> 01:05:55.958
Get back!

01:05:59.583 --> 01:06:00.666
Get back!

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:03.583
What?

01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:05.583
Wait here.

01:06:07.333 --> 01:06:08.291
Oh no.

01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:10.458
Head!

01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:23.458
You stay put.

01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:27.791
Get him.

01:06:30.833 --> 01:06:31.833
Hee-yeol!

01:06:35.541 --> 01:06:37.333
Where are you going, fucker?

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:41.916
Gi-jun!

01:06:42.375 --> 01:06:43.458
Who are you?

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:46.500
The police.

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.791
Can I see your badge?

01:06:57.041 --> 01:06:59.291
You shouldn't play cop.

01:07:01.041 --> 01:07:02.208
Fucker.

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:15.333
This fucker can take it pretty well.

01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:36.250
Get up.

01:07:36.458 --> 01:07:38.125
Get up, bitch.

01:07:48.333 --> 01:07:49.458
Police?

01:07:50.541 --> 01:07:52.125
Motherfucker.

01:08:13.916 --> 01:08:14.916
Gi-jun.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:49.541
Gi-jun.

01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:51.124
Get up.

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:52.082
Gi-jun.

01:08:53.916 --> 01:08:55.250
Hee-yeol.

01:08:59.457 --> 01:09:01.916
Something's dripping down my face.

01:09:02.082 --> 01:09:04.749
Your head's bleeding a lot.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.207
I knew it.

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:08.749
It feels really hot.

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:11.416
I think they extract organs here.

01:09:14.916 --> 01:09:16.207
Do something.

01:09:26.582 --> 01:09:27.666
You go!

01:09:43.166 --> 01:09:44.207
Be quiet.

01:09:44.791 --> 01:09:47.082
It freaking hurts.

01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:53.082
My shoulders hurt.

01:09:59.791 --> 01:10:01.625
Where are our jackets?

01:10:02.125 --> 01:10:05.791
It's all gone. No wallet and no phone.

01:10:07.458 --> 01:10:08.624
Let's get out of here for now.

01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:10.375
Okay. No buttons either.

01:10:41.333 --> 01:10:42.416
Was that you?

01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:09.916
Gi-jun.

01:11:13.041 --> 01:11:14.708
Go!

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:21.458
Run, run!

01:11:22.875 --> 01:11:23.791
Run!

01:11:25.583 --> 01:11:27.500
Get them!

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:37.791
It's a dead end.

01:11:38.833 --> 01:11:40.208
Stop right there.

01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:03.583
Go.

01:12:35.083 --> 01:12:36.750
Shit!

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.540
Police station.

01:12:44.541 --> 01:12:46.208
Police station!
We're almost there.

01:12:56.708 --> 01:12:58.000
We're safe.

01:12:58.125 --> 01:13:00.707
Fuckers. Go get the girls. Now!

01:13:00.708 --> 01:13:01.916
Hurry!

01:13:02.458 --> 01:13:04.540
Where are they going?

01:13:04.541 --> 01:13:06.374
Are they going back to get the girls?

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:08.041
Let's go report them.

01:13:11.375 --> 01:13:12.309
Hello.

01:13:12.333 --> 01:13:13.624
How may I help you?

01:13:13.625 --> 01:13:17.040
There are girls locked up
in an abandoned building.

01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:17.875
An abandoned building?

01:13:17.876 --> 01:13:19.665
I don't know exactly where it is.

01:13:19.666 --> 01:13:21.540
It's within a 5 minute running distance.

01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:23.790
Come with us. We can explain.

01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:24.666
Let's go.

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:26.582
First, let me see your IDs, please.

01:13:26.583 --> 01:13:29.290
Pardon? They took our wallets and phones.

01:13:29.291 --> 01:13:32.415
I have to see your IDs first.
It's part of the process.

01:13:32.416 --> 01:13:35.624
Can't you just look up our resident number?

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:37.250
I need your photo IDs.

01:13:37.416 --> 01:13:40.290
If we don't go now, I don't know
what's gonna happen to the girls.

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:42.499
We must go now.
He's right.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.082
We have to follow the process.

01:13:44.083 --> 01:13:45.957
Is the process more important than
a person's life?

01:13:45.958 --> 01:13:46.791
Look.

01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:49.333
Because of the process, we can save people.

01:13:50.166 --> 01:13:52.499
Fucking police. Fuck you.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.291
Fuck you?

01:13:53.292 --> 01:13:55.332
Gi-jun.
Come on!

01:13:55.333 --> 01:13:57.457
Are you gonna be responsible
if something happens to those girls?

01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:59.124
Huh? Are you?

01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:00.749
You punks.

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:01.541
We're sorry.

01:14:01.541 --> 01:14:02.500
Let's go.

01:14:02.501 --> 01:14:03.790
You two, stop right there.

01:14:03.791 --> 01:14:05.832
Stop and do what?
Gi-jun.

01:14:05.833 --> 01:14:07.374
Stop it.
You're gonna shoot us?

01:14:07.375 --> 01:14:08.000
Yes, I am.

01:14:08.001 --> 01:14:09.290
Shoot me then.

01:14:09.291 --> 01:14:10.708
I will shoot.
Shoot me.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.125
What's this?

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:27.416
"3 Missed Calls"

01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:37.999
Why're they handcuffed?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.832
They didn't have IDs.

01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:42.041
And they made a scene
at the police station.

01:14:44.166 --> 01:14:46.915
They're Police University students.
Please let them go.

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.541
Please show me your ID.

01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:52.208
I'm Prof. Yang Sung-ii
at Police University.

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:57.790
Sir, girls are locked up in
an abandoned building.

01:14:57.791 --> 01:14:58.583
What?

01:14:58.958 --> 01:15:00.958
Someone's retrieving their eggs.

01:15:07.125 --> 01:15:08.541
Where's this abandoned building?

01:15:10.041 --> 01:15:14.415
In 2007, I caught an egg broker and
saw that ovulation drug for the first time.

01:15:14.416 --> 01:15:17.332
A healthy woman normally
produces one egg per month.

01:15:17.333 --> 01:15:20.540
With this drug, she can
produce up to 20 eggs.

01:15:20.541 --> 01:15:25.749
Egg brokers connect infertile couples and
egg donors for a fee.

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:27.040
Listening to your story,

01:15:27.041 --> 01:15:29.665
I think some criminal organization
kidnaps and locks up high school girls

01:15:29.666 --> 01:15:33.000
and periodically retrieves their eggs,
like in an egg farm.

01:15:39.666 --> 01:15:40.875
Sir, this is the place.

01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:49.791
They're gone.

01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:51.833
They were locked up here.

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:55.250
She had severe bleeding and a high fever.

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:09.666
This isn't something that
a patrol division can handle.

01:16:09.875 --> 01:16:13.166
Let me ask someone from RIU,
the Regional Investigation Unit.

01:16:14.958 --> 01:16:17.457
Will they start the investigation today?

01:16:17.458 --> 01:16:19.500
No, not that fast.

01:16:19.666 --> 01:16:20.791
Pardon?

01:16:21.541 --> 01:16:24.082
Then when can they start?

01:16:24.083 --> 01:16:26.915
They have their own schedules.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.874
Internal investigation
alone will take 2 weeks.

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:30.000
2 weeks.

01:16:30.958 --> 01:16:35.749
But you said the most crucial factor
in kidnapping cases is time.

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:40.415
That's correct, but there are
other lives to save also.

01:16:40.416 --> 01:16:43.625
Every life is important.

01:16:44.458 --> 01:16:47.915
Is there any unit that can start sooner?

01:16:47.916 --> 01:16:50.332
There's something called
intelligence-based investigation.

01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:54.165
Special Investigation Unit and RIU
usually handle them.

01:16:54.166 --> 01:16:57.916
But SIU is busier than RIU right now.

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:04.249
Then can we look for them ourselves?

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:05.041
That's right.

01:17:05.042 --> 01:17:07.540
They couldn't have taken
all the girls too far away.

01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:11.332
I understand how you feel
but there's nothing we can do.

01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:12.374
Go back to school.

01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:13.458
Prof. Yang!

01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:20.583
They were younger than us.

01:17:20.791 --> 01:17:23.082
They were kidnapped and locked up.

01:17:23.083 --> 01:17:24.333
You kids.

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:26.958
You're not police officers.

01:17:27.583 --> 01:17:29.040
You're still students.

01:17:29.041 --> 01:17:30.666
Even if we're students,

01:17:30.791 --> 01:17:33.124
we witnessed the crime and have evidence.

01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:35.040
Why can't we do anything?

01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:37.166
Don't get smart with me.

01:17:38.916 --> 01:17:42.083
Let the adults take it from here.

01:17:42.416 --> 01:17:43.583
Got it?

01:17:44.583 --> 01:17:46.333
You punks.
Prof. Yang.

01:17:46.666 --> 01:17:50.125
I know the license plate number
of the kidnapper's van.

01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:55.082
It's an old green Starex. 37GU8338.

01:17:55.083 --> 01:17:57.707
I know you can run a plate number
with one phone call.

01:17:57.708 --> 01:17:59.290
Please, just this once.

01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:00.875
Please, I beg you.

01:18:10.208 --> 01:18:11.500
Hi, Do-chul.

01:18:11.916 --> 01:18:14.041
I know. It's been 10 years.

01:18:14.333 --> 01:18:15.665
I need a favor.

01:18:15.666 --> 01:18:17.541
Will you run a plate number?

01:18:18.958 --> 01:18:20.291
37GU...

01:18:22.958 --> 01:18:24.333
8338.
Let's go.

01:18:24.625 --> 01:18:25.791
Yes, now.

01:18:27.166 --> 01:18:28.208
Is that right?

01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:31.625
Thanks. Bye.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:41.625
It's an unregistered vehicle.

01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:45.625
They have to manually
search the CCTV tapes.

01:18:46.375 --> 01:18:50.165
The case's detective has to file
an official request to the CCTV center.

01:18:50.166 --> 01:18:54.290
RIU will be done with
their case in a month.

01:18:54.291 --> 01:18:55.374
They'll be able to help then.

01:18:55.375 --> 01:18:56.333
One...

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.500
How can we wait a month?

01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:03.665
Then should they throw out everything
and work on our case?

01:19:03.666 --> 01:19:06.041
That's not what I meant.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.666
I'm done talking.

01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:15.790
So you two go back to
school and study hard.

01:19:15.791 --> 01:19:18.457
If you get involved with this again,
you'll be expelled.

01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:19.500
Got it?

01:19:19.958 --> 01:19:21.625
Yes, Sir.

01:19:22.125 --> 01:19:25.415
You kids. Always answer loud and clear!

01:19:25.416 --> 01:19:26.750
Yes, Sir!

01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:04.875
Hee-yeol.

01:20:04.875 --> 01:20:05.708
Yeah.

01:20:06.791 --> 01:20:11.000
Are they gonna be okay?

01:20:18.333 --> 01:20:20.291
The upside is that

01:20:20.833 --> 01:20:22.999
we still have time to save them.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.958
Hey, where's my jacket?

01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:29.499
Geez, what's wrong with you two?

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.957
Something came up.
I'll buy you a jacket. Sorry.

01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:34.291
Well...

01:20:35.208 --> 01:20:36.458
Forget it.

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:38.916
Did you go to the hospital?

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:40.791
We just got back.

01:20:41.625 --> 01:20:45.416
Hey, your father still
works for the force, right?

01:20:45.625 --> 01:20:48.874
You bet. The chief loves my father.

01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:52.333
Then he might have friends
at Gangnam CCTV center, right?

01:20:52.791 --> 01:20:55.124
We know someone there too.

01:20:55.125 --> 01:20:55.767
Who?

01:20:55.791 --> 01:20:57.041
Who?

01:20:57.166 --> 01:20:58.582
I'm too afraid to say it.

01:20:58.583 --> 01:21:00.583
Just spit it out.

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:02.541
No, I can't.

01:21:02.542 --> 01:21:03.791
Just tell us.

01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:05.375
No.

01:21:05.376 --> 01:21:08.041
Why not?
Say it. Come on, loser.

01:21:09.583 --> 01:21:10.832
Medusa.

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:13.457
You were playing phone games
during working hours?

01:21:13.458 --> 01:21:14.874
How dare you?

01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:15.957
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

01:21:15.958 --> 01:21:17.124
I bet you're sorry.

01:21:17.125 --> 01:21:19.125
We're sorry, Ma'am.

01:21:24.041 --> 01:21:25.041
Hello?

01:21:28.208 --> 01:21:31.291
Hello? Good afternoon, Ma'am.

01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:34.749
This is cadet Gi-jun Park, Class of 2017.

01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:35.666
Hi.

01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:38.332
Long time no see.

01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:40.957
How have you been, Ma'am?

01:21:40.958 --> 01:21:42.790
I'm good.

01:21:42.791 --> 01:21:44.124
What do you want?

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:48.374
My friend was the victim in
a hit-and-run in Gangnam.

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:52.332
Police said the driver's
car was unregistered.

01:21:52.333 --> 01:21:55.707
We'll have to manually search
all the CCTV tapes to find that.

01:21:55.708 --> 01:21:56.583
It'll take days.

01:21:56.584 --> 01:22:01.083
Yes, I heard about that.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:05.375
It's really important.
Just this once, please.

01:22:08.250 --> 01:22:09.208
All right.

01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:11.165
License plate number, make and model.

01:22:11.166 --> 01:22:13.874
Time and place of the
crime, last place seen.

01:22:13.875 --> 01:22:15.040
Text me all those.

01:22:15.041 --> 01:22:15.500
Yes, Ma'am.

01:22:15.501 --> 01:22:19.457
I'll find it no matter what.
You catch the driver.

01:22:19.458 --> 01:22:20.291
Yes, Ma'am.

01:22:20.292 --> 01:22:23.040
So there'll be no other victims. Got it?

01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:25.791
Thank you, Ma'am.

01:22:26.833 --> 01:22:29.458
She said okay?
This is great.

01:22:29.708 --> 01:22:32.582
Now, we should prepare.

01:22:32.583 --> 01:22:34.208
So now.

01:22:34.541 --> 01:22:36.458
We get weapons.

01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:43.583
Two police batons.

01:22:44.541 --> 01:22:46.041
Two handcuffs.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.541
Two Taser guns.

01:22:49.083 --> 01:22:50.541
Two protective gear.

01:22:51.375 --> 01:22:52.333
Is this correct?

01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:57.665
Is this everything Prof. Yang asked for?

01:22:57.666 --> 01:22:59.875
I think so.

01:23:00.166 --> 01:23:01.125
Yup.

01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:03.582
Return them by next Wednesday
in original condition.

01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:04.458
Wednesday.

01:23:04.459 --> 01:23:05.833
Yes.
Okay, Wednesday.

01:23:06.625 --> 01:23:07.416
Thank you.

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:08.416
Thank you.

01:23:12.125 --> 01:23:13.083
I'll shoot.

01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:14.458
Be careful.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:17.458
I did it.

01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:18.375
You did?

01:23:18.541 --> 01:23:19.166
Wow!

01:23:19.167 --> 01:23:20.374
We can definitely catch him with this.

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:21.541
Heck ya.

01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:24.250
We gotta get them out.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.625
Nasty.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.833
We can't use this.

01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:41.333
Fuck.

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:44.750
Forget the eggs. Get her organs.

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:47.040
Please don't kill me.

01:23:47.041 --> 01:23:49.666
Where are you taking her?

01:23:51.333 --> 01:23:52.707
Please save her.

01:23:52.708 --> 01:23:53.875
Please I beg you.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.541
Please.

01:24:03.666 --> 01:24:04.583
Hey.

01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:06.791
Are you okay?

01:24:08.916 --> 01:24:10.166
Oh my goodness.

01:24:27.375 --> 01:24:28.624
Asshole.
One more.

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:31.041
Just one more.

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:34.416
Last one.

01:24:46.833 --> 01:24:49.583
Nope, cancel that. 98.

01:24:55.541 --> 01:24:59.957
One, two, three, four five, six, seven.

01:24:59.958 --> 01:25:02.000
Eight, nine, ten.

01:25:03.125 --> 01:25:04.541
They're dead meat.

01:25:05.708 --> 01:25:09.916
Intelligence-based investigation starts
without receiving a crime report.

01:25:10.291 --> 01:25:17.458
Police are first to recognize the crime
and start investigating.

01:26:04.416 --> 01:26:05.708
Let's grill them all.

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.040
It's Medusa.

01:26:37.041 --> 01:26:38.458
I almost shit myself.

01:26:38.583 --> 01:26:39.500
Hello, Ma'am.

01:26:39.501 --> 01:26:41.249
What took you so long to answer?

01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:42.499
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.999
The van you're looking for.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.290
It's 37GU8338, correct?

01:26:46.291 --> 01:26:47.208
Yes, Ma'am.

01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:49.874
On Nov. 13th and 27th at 5 pm,

01:26:49.875 --> 01:26:53.726
I have it turning left on Kyodae junction
toward Seoul Arts Center.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:56.000
I also found something interesting.

01:26:56.583 --> 01:26:59.415
On both times,
there's another Starex behind it.

01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:02.124
With H Fertility Clinic logo on it.

01:27:02.125 --> 01:27:04.332
It might be connected so do your research.

01:27:04.333 --> 01:27:06.750
Yes, Ma'am. Thank you, Ma'am.

01:27:13.958 --> 01:27:15.333
"H Fertility Clinic"

01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:19.517
"Closed 2nd and 4th Sundays"

01:27:19.541 --> 01:27:21.750
I think this is where they retrieve eggs.

01:27:22.666 --> 01:27:24.583
2nd Sunday is...

01:27:25.208 --> 01:27:26.666
Two days from now.

01:27:29.666 --> 01:27:31.625
You think we can do this?

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:36.976
You cracking up?

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.934
You scared, wuss?

01:27:38.958 --> 01:27:40.500
Shut up, idiot.

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:45.000
The girls.

01:27:46.375 --> 01:27:48.041
Let's go save them.

01:27:49.708 --> 01:27:51.333
Stay alive until then.

01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:03.749
Ms. Yun-Jung is a college student,
majoring in English.

01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:07.165
To support herself financially,

01:28:07.166 --> 01:28:09.374
she has donated her eggs.

01:28:09.375 --> 01:28:13.499
I've met her myself.
She's healthy and outgoing.

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:14.915
She's tall too.

01:28:14.916 --> 01:28:16.832
She's beautiful.

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:17.708
Yes, she is.

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:27.416
The cost of IVF with Ms. Lee's eggs
will be about $80,000.

01:28:29.083 --> 01:28:31.000
Anything for our baby.

01:28:31.333 --> 01:28:35.958
I promise you
the most beautiful baby in the world.

01:28:36.458 --> 01:28:37.708
Have faith in me.

01:28:39.666 --> 01:28:40.874
This, this, this, this.

01:28:40.875 --> 01:28:43.208
This, this, this. Get them in the van.

01:28:51.958 --> 01:28:54.583
Young police officers, be ambitious.

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:09.000
There they come, 8338.

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:17.708
Hurry and get off the van. Fucking bitches.

01:29:22.208 --> 01:29:24.458
That's $20,000. I put in a bit more.

01:29:24.791 --> 01:29:25.958
Thank you.

01:30:01.041 --> 01:30:02.791
To the operating room, please.

01:30:15.791 --> 01:30:16.957
When are you gonna play next?

01:30:16.958 --> 01:30:19.375
I don't know. If you got money...

01:30:20.666 --> 01:30:21.958
What's that noise?

01:30:37.791 --> 01:30:39.291
Those fuckers are back.

01:30:53.875 --> 01:30:56.166
That's a lot of thugs.

01:30:58.083 --> 01:30:59.125
Let's go.

01:32:49.875 --> 01:32:51.392
Gi-jun, you okay?

01:32:51.416 --> 01:32:52.875
Geez. You scared me.

01:32:53.250 --> 01:32:54.416
You okay?

01:32:56.041 --> 01:32:57.500
What happened to your hand?

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.374
I'm sorry.

01:32:59.375 --> 01:33:00.916
Bitch.

01:33:01.791 --> 01:33:03.082
I think it's fractured.

01:33:03.083 --> 01:33:04.750
Dumbass.

01:33:05.333 --> 01:33:07.083
What about your Taser guns?

01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:09.082
They're smashed.

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.041
What?

01:33:10.916 --> 01:33:12.166
We're screwed.

01:33:12.666 --> 01:33:14.375
What do we do?

01:33:15.791 --> 01:33:19.000
Before they wake up, let's go up.

01:33:19.958 --> 01:33:21.000
Get up.

01:33:31.833 --> 01:33:33.166
Doors opening.

01:33:35.375 --> 01:33:36.458
What the...

01:33:39.375 --> 01:33:40.583
Excuse me.

01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:44.000
Which floor is the operating room?

01:33:44.208 --> 01:33:45.416
The 8th floor.

01:33:46.291 --> 01:33:47.416
Thank you.

01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:55.333
My nose freaking hurts.

01:33:56.916 --> 01:33:58.166
Shit.

01:34:21.375 --> 01:34:22.416
Gi-jun!

01:34:29.375 --> 01:34:30.708
Lots of eggs.

01:34:31.458 --> 01:34:32.750
I don't know about this.

01:34:59.333 --> 01:35:00.832
Let's cuff him.

01:35:00.833 --> 01:35:01.833
Okay. You go first.

01:35:01.834 --> 01:35:03.124
No, you go first.

01:35:03.125 --> 01:35:04.790
No, you hit him with the baton first.

01:35:04.791 --> 01:35:05.958
Fuckers.

01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:10.625
You're gonna die today, fucking bitches.

01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:26.375
What the heck?

01:36:17.583 --> 01:36:18.851
Let's gang up on him.

01:36:18.875 --> 01:36:20.041
All right!

01:36:42.833 --> 01:36:44.333
Cuff his legs first.

01:36:50.541 --> 01:36:52.083
We're okay now.

01:36:55.083 --> 01:36:56.374
Where's the operating room?

01:36:56.375 --> 01:36:57.499
The operating room?

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:58.624
I think it's that way.

01:36:58.625 --> 01:36:59.666
Let's go.

01:37:08.333 --> 01:37:10.750
We almost made a big mistake.
We gotta return these.

01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:12.666
Come on.

01:37:13.833 --> 01:37:15.833
Enjoy your right to remain silent.

01:37:20.375 --> 01:37:21.624
Stop right there!

01:37:21.625 --> 01:37:22.625
Who the hell are you?

01:37:22.626 --> 01:37:24.250
Don't you know what stop means?

01:37:24.791 --> 01:37:25.791
Good job.

01:37:26.958 --> 01:37:28.165
Is she okay?

01:37:28.166 --> 01:37:30.041
She was put under general anesthesia.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.583
Where are the other girls?

01:37:39.916 --> 01:37:41.041
Hee-yeol?

01:37:41.250 --> 01:37:42.208
Yeah.

01:37:44.041 --> 01:37:45.540
Let's call Prof. Yang.

01:37:45.541 --> 01:37:46.750
Prof. Yang...

01:37:47.708 --> 01:37:49.166
Then we'll get expelled.

01:37:51.041 --> 01:37:52.666
We have no choice.

01:37:53.416 --> 01:37:54.583
Let's call him.

01:37:57.291 --> 01:37:58.458
Okay, let's do it.

01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:23.791
One.

01:38:24.125 --> 01:38:25.083
Two.

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.458
Three.

01:38:26.875 --> 01:38:27.875
Four.

01:38:41.458 --> 01:38:44.250
You two have no regrets even
if you get expelled, correct?

01:38:46.958 --> 01:38:49.458
I believe I've done the right thing, Sir.

01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:52.208
Same here, Sir.

01:38:52.958 --> 01:38:54.166
But Prof. Yang.

01:38:55.083 --> 01:38:56.833
I still want to go to class, Sir.

01:38:57.041 --> 01:38:58.000
Why?

01:38:58.250 --> 01:39:00.916
I thought we learned
useless stuff in school.

01:39:01.458 --> 01:39:02.875
But it wasn't true.

01:39:03.250 --> 01:39:04.875
I want to learn more.

01:39:05.958 --> 01:39:07.207
How about you, Gi-jun?

01:39:07.208 --> 01:39:09.208
I'd like to stay also, Sir.

01:39:11.125 --> 01:39:12.166
I...

01:39:13.833 --> 01:39:15.041
want...

01:39:17.166 --> 01:39:18.583
to be a police officer.

01:39:27.333 --> 01:39:32.915
If we don't take disciplinary action,
it would set a bad precedent.

01:39:32.916 --> 01:39:36.374
But in the end,
our students did the right thing.

01:39:36.375 --> 01:39:38.790
They saved over 20 kidnap victims.

01:39:38.791 --> 01:39:41.374
They should be rewarded not punished.

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:43.124
Are you out of your mind?

01:39:43.125 --> 01:39:46.249
How could you reward someone
who committed violence?

01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:49.332
Strictly speaking, they've
committed a crime.

01:39:49.333 --> 01:39:51.749
Are you crazy calling
our students criminals?

01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:55.124
Then everyone should
go catch criminals instead of studying.

01:39:55.125 --> 01:39:57.874
I think you're out of line.

01:39:57.875 --> 01:40:00.249
They're not just regular students.

01:40:00.250 --> 01:40:02.040
They're the future police officers.

01:40:02.041 --> 01:40:05.541
They're not officers yet.
Expel them.

01:40:11.166 --> 01:40:13.083
Prof. Yang, what do you think?

01:40:17.083 --> 01:40:19.791
Someone talked about
setting a bad precedent.

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.624
If Gi-jun Park and Hee-yeol Kang

01:40:22.625 --> 01:40:25.958
neglected the kidnap victims and
stayed in school,

01:40:26.458 --> 01:40:29.416
I think that would be a worse precedent.

01:40:29.583 --> 01:40:35.915
We taught them to be the first ones
to respond to civilians in danger.

01:40:35.916 --> 01:40:42.416
But if they've neglected victims
so they wouldn't be punished,

01:40:43.208 --> 01:40:47.916
I think that's more dishonorable,
and they should be expelled.

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:52.832
Personally, I was envious of the two.

01:40:52.833 --> 01:40:56.166
We once had that kind of passion.

01:40:57.666 --> 01:41:03.250
We weren't afraid of punishment
when it came to catching bad guys.

01:41:03.666 --> 01:41:07.750
I think we've taught them well.

01:41:08.458 --> 01:41:11.915
They're not like those selfish kids.

01:41:11.916 --> 01:41:15.708
For others, they'd run all night.

01:41:15.958 --> 01:41:19.166
It makes me happy that
we've taught them well.

01:41:21.750 --> 01:41:25.416
So what do you want to do with them?

01:41:35.291 --> 01:41:37.750
You punks should study
with such enthusiasm.

01:41:54.458 --> 01:41:56.750
Gi-jun Park. Hee-yeol Kang.

01:41:58.541 --> 01:42:02.458
You two should've been expelled.

01:42:05.666 --> 01:42:10.000
But President showed mercy,
and you're to be held back a year.

01:42:13.416 --> 01:42:14.458
Don't like it?

01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:18.166
I like it, Sir.

01:42:18.583 --> 01:42:20.166
Thank you, Sir.

01:42:21.125 --> 01:42:24.541
And you have 500 detention hours.

01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:30.375
Since you'll be in school one more year,
you should have enough time.

01:42:31.875 --> 01:42:32.833
Don't like it?

01:42:32.834 --> 01:42:33.957
It's great, Sir.

01:42:33.958 --> 01:42:36.665
You kids don't sound sincere.

01:42:36.666 --> 01:42:38.416
It's really great, Sir.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:39.916
Attention.

01:43:02.666 --> 01:43:03.666
Thank you, Sir.

01:43:03.667 --> 01:43:05.457
This is not the end.

01:43:05.458 --> 01:43:07.583
"Midnight Runners"

Hee-yeol.

01:44:24.208 --> 01:44:25.083
Yeah.

01:44:25.084 --> 01:44:27.165
How many hours of detention
do we have left?

01:44:27.166 --> 01:44:28.666
473 hours

01:44:29.291 --> 01:44:30.458
and 20 minutes.

01:44:33.458 --> 01:44:35.790
Not bad. Let's finish it up and
go to an Internet Café.

01:44:35.791 --> 01:44:37.041
Let's go shoot guns.

01:44:38.583 --> 01:44:39.934
What're you looking at?

01:44:39.958 --> 01:44:40.958
That.

01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:55.750
Hi.

01:45:12.041 --> 01:45:13.541
Thank you.

01:45:15.291 --> 01:45:17.166
Oh, this wind.

01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:19.833
You're welcome.

01:45:34.583 --> 01:45:36.208
You've survived.

01:45:42.583 --> 01:45:43.625
Are you okay?

01:45:44.041 --> 01:45:45.416
Let me see if she's okay.

01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:49.791
Would you like a campus tour?

01:45:50.125 --> 01:45:50.958
Come on.

01:45:50.959 --> 01:45:52.791
You look so good.

01:45:53.083 --> 01:45:54.332
I'm Hee-yeol Kang.
