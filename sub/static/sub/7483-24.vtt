WEBVTT

00:03.704 --> 00:07.472
We use these coins to identify
refugees wanting

00:07.474 --> 00:09.707
to escape from Russia.

00:09.709 --> 00:11.475
Who gave the
refugees the coins?

00:11.477 --> 00:13.276
My father?
Possibly.

00:13.278 --> 00:15.544
You brokered a deal
to supply a supertanker

00:15.546 --> 00:17.579
to break our economic sanctions
with Russia.

00:17.581 --> 00:19.314
I am broker, middle man.

00:19.316 --> 00:22.750
HETTY:
Ivan Karposev is the kind of man
you don't double-cross

00:22.752 --> 00:24.485
and live to tell the tale.

00:24.487 --> 00:25.486
CALLEN:
Her name's Anna.

00:25.488 --> 00:27.054
She is my daughter.

00:27.056 --> 00:29.156
Karposev took
her with him.
Where?

00:29.158 --> 00:30.056
To Russia.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.669
CALLEN:
Karposev's

00:44.671 --> 00:47.371
holding Anna hostage.
We don't want to spook him.

00:47.373 --> 00:49.506
He's got three bodyguards
up here with him.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.107
Anybody got eyes on 'em?

00:51.109 --> 00:53.109
Negative.
It's all quiet back here.

00:53.111 --> 00:55.044
(rapid gunfire)
CALLEN: Gunfire.

00:56.414 --> 00:58.380
(two bursts of rapid gunfire,
bullets ricocheting)

00:59.249 --> 01:02.083
They're firing
on Karposev and Anna.

01:02.085 --> 01:03.417
(engine revving)

01:03.419 --> 01:04.484
(rapid gunfire)

01:09.257 --> 01:10.122
DEEKS: Move!

01:10.124 --> 01:12.057
Moving!

01:31.377 --> 01:32.676
He's down.
Move.

01:32.678 --> 01:33.843
Moving.

01:33.845 --> 01:36.812
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

01:43.653 --> 01:45.552
He's gone.

01:48.757 --> 01:51.390
We'll take the SUV,
go after Karposev and Anna.

01:51.392 --> 01:53.158
DEEKS (over radio):
All right, we got the runner.

02:23.790 --> 02:24.889
(computer blipping)

02:24.891 --> 02:26.557
NELL:
The satellite uplink is secure.

02:26.559 --> 02:28.559
This is what we've got, so far.

02:28.561 --> 02:30.494
When the team arrived
at the cabin

02:30.496 --> 02:32.829
to secure Ivan Karposev
and Anastasia Kolcheck,

02:32.831 --> 02:36.332
they ran into a hit squad that
was there to take out Karposev.

02:36.334 --> 02:39.435
And Anna fled with Karposev?

02:39.437 --> 02:41.203
It was a no-win situation.

02:41.205 --> 02:43.405
She either runs with the
man that kidnapped her,

02:43.407 --> 02:45.173
or stays and
gets gunned down.

02:45.175 --> 02:47.408
Now, Hetty, I don't have
I.D.'s on the shooters,

02:47.410 --> 02:49.676
but the three dead
in front of the house

02:49.678 --> 02:51.644
were Karposev's bodyguards.

02:51.646 --> 02:54.880
NELL: Now, maybe the hit squad
was a group of Karposev's men

02:54.882 --> 02:56.748
that turned on him,
to take the stolen oil

02:56.750 --> 02:58.916
for themselves--
we're not sure.

02:58.918 --> 03:01.251
And where are Callen and Sam?

03:01.253 --> 03:04.921
There are westbound on
Krasnaya Presnya near the zoo.

03:04.923 --> 03:07.590
They don't have a visual
on Karposev or Anna.

03:07.592 --> 03:10.359
And, uh, Ms. Blye and Mr. Deeks?

03:10.361 --> 03:13.328
They're about two
kilometers into the forest,

03:13.330 --> 03:15.496
still tracking the
last hit squad shooter.

03:15.498 --> 03:17.831
The team's encrypted trackers
are working, but I'm blind.

03:17.833 --> 03:19.799
The Kremlin's CCTV system
is on lockdown.

03:19.801 --> 03:21.534
I can hack it, but...

03:21.536 --> 03:22.868
ARKADY:
Henrietta.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.570
This kitchen is bare.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.638
HETTY:
I understand, Mr. Beale.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.206
Keep me posted.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.641
Got it.
Good luck.

03:31.643 --> 03:35.378
No food, just loose teas,
Scotch, vodka.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.713
You must own
this apartment.

03:37.715 --> 03:42.417
You don't let anything
get past you, do you, Arkady?

03:42.419 --> 03:47.188
Can I ask you why
you keep an apartment in Moscow?

03:47.190 --> 03:50.824
I won it in a poker game,
in 1992.

03:50.826 --> 03:52.892
Oh.

03:56.397 --> 03:58.397
It has been remodeled since.

03:58.399 --> 04:02.567
It was purposely rebuilt

04:02.569 --> 04:06.203
and stocked with weapons
for times like this.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.673
Furniture is dated.

04:09.675 --> 04:11.975
You begged to come to Moscow

04:11.977 --> 04:14.444
to look for your daughter Anna.

04:14.446 --> 04:16.779
And now, you're here,

04:16.781 --> 04:19.815
you want
to talk about interior design?

04:19.817 --> 04:22.517
It is conversation.

04:22.519 --> 04:25.520
I don't want conversation
from you.

04:25.522 --> 04:27.655
I want information

04:27.657 --> 04:30.958
about the stolen oil
and the people who stole it.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.861
You were lonely in school.

04:34.863 --> 04:37.730
I was the queen of the prom,

04:37.732 --> 04:39.798
sweetheart.

04:41.868 --> 04:43.868
What you doing?

04:43.870 --> 04:45.870
Same thing I was
doing five minutes ago,

04:45.872 --> 04:47.404
the last time you asked.

04:47.406 --> 04:49.639
I'm trying to figure
out who these guys are

04:49.641 --> 04:50.940
that came after
Karposev and Anna.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.308
(sighs)

04:52.310 --> 04:54.777
(computer beeps)
Whoa. Check it out.

04:54.779 --> 04:56.845
I got a hit from Interpol
on facial rec.

04:56.847 --> 04:58.680
Looks like the guys
who came after them

04:58.682 --> 05:01.382
in Russia were from
Northern Ireland.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.950
They're mercenaries.

05:02.952 --> 05:04.952
Karposev's men didn't
turn on him.

05:04.954 --> 05:06.820
These guys were hired
to take him out.

05:06.822 --> 05:07.921
Yeah, but hired by who?

05:07.923 --> 05:10.556
Yeah.

05:10.558 --> 05:12.391
All right, Beale,
you're up and running.

05:12.393 --> 05:14.626
Full access to the
Kremlin's closed circuit

05:14.628 --> 05:16.928
surveillance system.
You got it for 30 hours.

05:16.930 --> 05:18.329
What?! Really?

05:18.331 --> 05:19.930
Just say "Thank you."

05:19.932 --> 05:22.732
Thank you, and how the heck
were you able to pull this off?

05:22.734 --> 05:24.433
Because I'm me.

05:24.435 --> 05:25.567
Swag.

05:25.569 --> 05:27.035
And no fingerprints, Beale.

05:27.037 --> 05:29.504
You get caught, I'll have
to turn you over to the Russians

05:29.506 --> 05:31.405
to avoid an
international incident.

05:31.407 --> 05:32.672
All right?

05:32.674 --> 05:34.006
(quietly): Ooh.

05:37.444 --> 05:39.577
SAM:<i> Somebody wanted Karposev</i>
<i> out of the way</i>

05:39.579 --> 05:41.812
<i> so they'd have</i>
<i> $80 million in oil</i>

05:41.814 --> 05:43.413
free and clear.

05:43.415 --> 05:46.349
Yeah, exactly.

05:47.785 --> 05:50.352
It's not the Moscow of old.

05:50.354 --> 05:52.554
You good being back here?

05:52.556 --> 05:54.756
Why wouldn't I be?

05:55.725 --> 05:57.024
It's where your family's from.

05:57.026 --> 05:58.291
It's your history.

05:58.293 --> 06:00.059
That's a pretty thin book.

06:00.061 --> 06:02.694
ERIC: Guys, I got a hit
on Karposev's Porsche.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.961
It's in an alley off Ribne.

06:03.963 --> 06:05.662
SAM:
Thanks, Eric.

06:05.664 --> 06:06.796
All right, take this turn.

06:26.984 --> 06:28.516
(gunfire)

06:55.645 --> 06:57.344
Drop it!

06:57.346 --> 07:01.948
Anastasia Kolcheck,
put the weapon down.
Shut up!

07:01.950 --> 07:04.350
I'm a United States
federal agent.

07:04.352 --> 07:06.352
Put the gun down.

07:06.354 --> 07:08.787
You first.

07:08.789 --> 07:10.588
I'm here to help you.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.623
Put it down.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.626
Do you want to die today?

07:15.628 --> 07:17.995
I said put it down.

07:17.997 --> 07:20.030
(Anna grunting)

07:20.032 --> 07:21.798
Hey. Stop.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.033
(panting)
Your father sent us.

07:24.035 --> 07:26.368
I don't have a father.

07:26.370 --> 07:28.069
Arkady Kolcheck?

07:28.071 --> 07:30.104
We're his friends.

07:30.106 --> 07:31.839
I'm more of an acquaintance.

07:36.378 --> 07:38.878
Then take me to him.

08:07.441 --> 08:09.507
You said Arkady
would be here.

08:11.577 --> 08:13.643
My beautiful daughter.

08:20.117 --> 08:21.116
Oh!

08:21.118 --> 08:22.050
(choking):
Oh, eh... hey!

08:22.052 --> 08:24.052
I am here to help.

08:24.054 --> 08:26.054
These men, who saved
you-- I brought them.

08:26.056 --> 08:28.022
They didn't save me.

08:29.025 --> 08:31.091
We didn't save her.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.992
I was kidnapped

08:32.994 --> 08:34.727
by a psychopath,

08:34.729 --> 08:37.429
held hostage, brought to Moscow.

08:37.431 --> 08:39.130
If I didn't kill Karposev,

08:39.132 --> 08:43.134
he was going
to keep me, like a pet.

08:43.136 --> 08:45.736
It was not my fault
that that happened.

08:45.738 --> 08:47.871
Not your fault?
No.

08:47.873 --> 08:50.473
(grunts)

08:50.475 --> 08:53.209
I had nothing
to do with this.

08:53.211 --> 08:56.545
They only took me
because I'm your daughter.

08:56.547 --> 09:01.549
Anna... please... stop.

09:01.551 --> 09:03.083
Pathetic.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.885
(sighs)

09:16.097 --> 09:18.097
Anna...

09:18.099 --> 09:21.600
um, I'm Henrietta Lange.

09:23.103 --> 09:26.838
Would you please have a cup
of tea with me in the kitchen?

09:26.840 --> 09:30.775
I don't think anything's gonna
get resolved here for a while.

09:41.053 --> 09:44.854
That did not work out
how I thought it would.

09:44.856 --> 09:48.123
No, but it was so fun
to watch.

09:48.125 --> 09:51.159
Maybe if you two
had saved her...

09:51.161 --> 09:53.127
We found Anna.

09:53.129 --> 09:55.195
Now it's on you
to lead us to the oil.

09:55.197 --> 09:56.863
I know a guy.

09:56.865 --> 09:58.231
He knows a guy.

09:58.233 --> 10:00.166
That sounds promising.

10:00.168 --> 10:02.234
He worked for me
years ago at KGB.

10:02.236 --> 10:03.568
He owes me his career.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.236
He will help.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.372
Call him.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.873
Set it up.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.208
Trail went cold.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.376
Well, maybe he's
holed up for the day.

10:13.378 --> 10:15.611
He's been moving
for three hours.

10:28.291 --> 10:30.357
He's down.

10:32.794 --> 10:34.860
Go.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.366
(sighs)

10:42.368 --> 10:44.634
Damn it, you killed him.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.335
Uh, you're welcome?

10:47.337 --> 10:51.272
We have to find out
who he was working for, man.

10:51.274 --> 10:53.374
He was shooting
at you repeatedly.

10:53.376 --> 10:55.376
Maybe Eric and Nell can help.

10:55.378 --> 10:57.745
All right, let's roll.

10:57.747 --> 11:01.281
Again, you're welcome.

11:04.986 --> 11:08.988
You seem like a nice enough
person, but, what you need,

11:08.990 --> 11:10.990
the questions you have,

11:10.992 --> 11:13.425
they're not my concern.

11:13.427 --> 11:15.093
All right.

11:15.095 --> 11:18.763
What about the, uh, people
who kidnapped you?

11:18.765 --> 11:21.732
Karposev is dead.

11:21.734 --> 11:25.268
You're looking for the
people Karposev worked with,

11:25.270 --> 11:28.671
people that, again,

11:28.673 --> 11:31.073
do not concern me.

11:31.075 --> 11:32.741
Well,

11:32.743 --> 11:37.345
you were born in Moscow

11:37.347 --> 11:40.214
but hold dual citizenship
with the U.S.

11:40.216 --> 11:43.350
Your mother
is from Champaign, Illinois,

11:43.352 --> 11:45.185
and she met your father...

11:45.187 --> 11:47.187
He's not my father.

11:47.189 --> 11:51.157
He's just a man
that got my mother pregnant.

11:52.326 --> 11:55.293
Where is this... going?

11:55.295 --> 11:59.096
You were a homicide detective
in Chicago.

11:59.098 --> 12:01.031
Maybe I just like
tropical weather.

12:01.033 --> 12:02.399
Then you quit

12:02.401 --> 12:04.401
the Chicago PD

12:04.403 --> 12:06.736
to work for the private sector,

12:06.738 --> 12:08.904
uh, security,

12:08.906 --> 12:10.405
surveillance,

12:10.407 --> 12:11.739
kidnap
and ransom.

12:11.741 --> 12:14.742
Oh. The irony.

12:14.744 --> 12:15.743
Mm-hmm.

12:15.745 --> 12:18.145
So you've worked predominantly

12:18.147 --> 12:20.981
for Russian corporate interests.

12:26.053 --> 12:30.055
That's probably true.

12:30.057 --> 12:33.091
But I believe
two things about you.

12:33.093 --> 12:35.760
At the edge of my seat.

12:35.762 --> 12:37.862
I believe

12:37.864 --> 12:40.197
that you could help me find

12:40.199 --> 12:43.233
the sellers of the stolen oil.

12:45.136 --> 12:48.137
And?
And...

12:48.139 --> 12:51.206
I believe you want to help me.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.274
(chuckles softly)

12:57.246 --> 12:59.479
(indistinct conversations;
light classical music playing)

13:12.426 --> 13:14.225
(woman speaks Russian)

13:20.866 --> 13:21.865
Where is he?

13:21.867 --> 13:23.433
He'll come.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.334
Why'd you choose
this place to meet?

13:25.336 --> 13:26.435
Old haunt.

13:29.406 --> 13:30.872
Pavel.

13:30.874 --> 13:33.107
(speaks Russian)

13:33.109 --> 13:35.509
I cringe at the thought
of anyone viewing me

13:35.511 --> 13:37.043
as your protégé.

13:37.045 --> 13:39.545
These men...

13:39.547 --> 13:41.346
they can be trusted?

13:41.348 --> 13:43.848
They are with me.
You can trust them.

13:43.850 --> 13:48.085
The latter does not bolster
the former.

13:48.087 --> 13:49.086
We're on the same page

13:49.088 --> 13:50.921
regarding Arkady.

13:50.923 --> 13:55.292
I don't like him,
but he's not wrong.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.427
At one time I worked for him,

13:57.429 --> 13:59.962
and as painful as it is
to admit,

13:59.964 --> 14:02.297
he saved my life.

14:02.299 --> 14:05.400
A sacrifice I would make again
in a heartbeat, Pavel.

14:05.402 --> 14:07.402
You were the reason
those men were there

14:07.404 --> 14:09.470
to kill me in the first place.

14:09.472 --> 14:11.472
Look, if you
can help us,

14:11.474 --> 14:14.374
it would be
greatly appreciated.

14:18.413 --> 14:21.414
It's best you don't know
which agency I'm working for,

14:21.416 --> 14:23.482
but trust that

14:23.484 --> 14:25.951
my informants
are reliable.

14:25.953 --> 14:28.019
Hmm?

14:29.422 --> 14:32.356
I don't know who's handling
the sale of the stolen oil,

14:32.358 --> 14:34.825
now that Karposev is dead.

14:34.827 --> 14:38.094
But I recently learned of a
number of international parties

14:38.096 --> 14:39.428
entering Moscow,

14:39.430 --> 14:41.830
parties whose...

14:41.832 --> 14:47.302
affiliations have a history of
buying oil on the black market.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.904
Do these parties have names?

14:58.914 --> 15:01.047
That is all I know.

15:09.957 --> 15:12.157
We will not ever meet again.

15:21.067 --> 15:23.467
Does anyone in Russia like you?

15:23.469 --> 15:25.302
These are anomalies.

15:25.304 --> 15:28.338
You know I'm
good-time guy.

15:28.340 --> 15:31.441
Good-time guy.
Right.

15:32.410 --> 15:35.610
Send these names to Ops.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.313
(door opens)

15:39.315 --> 15:40.447
(door shuts)

15:40.449 --> 15:43.115
I think we are finished here.

15:45.018 --> 15:47.084
Why are we here?

15:48.187 --> 15:49.486
To meet Pavel, of course.

15:49.488 --> 15:50.587
No.

15:50.589 --> 15:53.556
You chose this location
for a reason.

15:55.026 --> 15:57.026
Yes.

15:57.028 --> 15:58.360
And now you're trying
to decide whether or not

15:58.362 --> 15:59.561
you're gonna tell me
that reason.

15:59.563 --> 16:01.563
Yes.

16:01.565 --> 16:03.898
You know more
than you're telling me

16:03.900 --> 16:06.333
about the identity of my father.

16:06.335 --> 16:09.602
I never took you
for sentimental type.

16:09.604 --> 16:12.271
You may not have known
he was my father at the time,

16:12.273 --> 16:13.939
but after Hans Schrieber
was killed,

16:13.941 --> 16:15.941
you started
to piece things together.

16:15.943 --> 16:18.276
My father helped people escape
from Russia.

16:18.278 --> 16:21.178
You helped those same people
set up new lives in America.

16:21.180 --> 16:24.247
You worked together.

16:30.688 --> 16:33.689
Follow me.

16:33.691 --> 16:36.324
(door opens)

16:45.401 --> 16:50.070
This cafe has had four owners
in a little over 100 years.

16:50.072 --> 16:53.706
But let me tell you what is most
interesting about this cafe.

16:53.708 --> 16:57.109
Throughout four owners
and 100 years,

16:57.111 --> 17:01.179
they have managed to keep
the same espresso machine.

17:01.181 --> 17:04.715
They have been serving
exact same cup

17:04.717 --> 17:09.652
of espresso
for over 100 years.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.654
And certain people

17:11.656 --> 17:14.623
are very loyal
to this espresso...

17:14.625 --> 17:16.558
Arkady...

17:16.560 --> 17:20.295
...your father
being one of them.

17:20.297 --> 17:22.630
So my father had espresso here
before he was incarcerated

17:22.632 --> 17:24.431
and sent off to the Gulag.

17:24.433 --> 17:25.698
What is your point?

17:25.700 --> 17:28.701
Your father was sent
to Gulag in 1974.

17:28.703 --> 17:30.402
Correct.

17:30.404 --> 17:32.670
The man I worked with in Russia,

17:32.672 --> 17:37.708
that man continued to help
refugees escape until 1988.

17:40.679 --> 17:42.745
If this is another lie...

17:59.530 --> 18:01.296
My father...

18:01.298 --> 18:03.464
That was taken
eight years

18:03.466 --> 18:06.166
after he was supposedly sent
to Gulag.

18:08.403 --> 18:10.403
How did he escape?

18:10.405 --> 18:11.737
I do not know.

18:11.739 --> 18:13.238
But you met him?
Once.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.672
In this cafe.

18:14.674 --> 18:17.274
He lived somewhere
outside of town.

18:17.276 --> 18:21.177
He used this cafe
as makeshift office.

18:21.179 --> 18:25.080
He took
meetings here.

18:25.082 --> 18:27.248
He wasn't known in Moscow.

18:29.252 --> 18:31.352
At a cafe like this,
he'd be anonymous.

18:31.354 --> 18:35.089
Maybe tradecraft

18:35.091 --> 18:36.223
or...

18:36.225 --> 18:40.093
maybe he just loves
the espresso.

18:58.812 --> 19:00.678
Eric's running the list
of potential buyers

19:00.680 --> 19:02.112
that Pavel gave us.

19:03.682 --> 19:05.114
Didn't
expect

19:05.116 --> 19:06.115
to see you again.

19:07.718 --> 19:10.318
Anna's decided that
she's nothing like Arkady

19:10.320 --> 19:12.787
and that she would like to help.

19:12.789 --> 19:15.523
You know I am standing
right here in the room.

19:15.525 --> 19:20.127
I heard Karposev speaking
about the sale of the oil.

19:20.129 --> 19:23.396
It is going to be done
on a secure satellite link.

19:23.398 --> 19:27.133
All of the buyers are using
anonymous representatives,

19:27.135 --> 19:28.667
who will be put
in separate rooms

19:28.669 --> 19:30.535
of the same
large building.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.103
What building?

19:32.105 --> 19:33.704
I don't know.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.640
But if we find the buyers,

19:36.642 --> 19:39.610
we follow the buyers
to the building.

19:39.612 --> 19:43.213
NELL: Hetty, I just I.D.'d
the man Kensi and Deeks shot.

19:43.215 --> 19:47.217
His name is Eliot Asadi, and
he was recently in Raqqa, Syria.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.851
HETTY:
Don't tell me.

19:48.853 --> 19:52.287
The CIA thinks that he's
been training in Raqqa.

19:52.289 --> 19:54.255
Hetty, he's a member of ISIS.

19:54.257 --> 19:57.491
Whether Karposev
knew it or not,

19:57.493 --> 19:59.926
he was working
for ISIS.

19:59.928 --> 20:02.461
There's no way ISIS was gonna
cut him in on the profits.

20:02.463 --> 20:05.597
Okay, so they send a hit squad
after Karposev

20:05.599 --> 20:07.665
but Anna beats them to it
and kills him.

20:07.667 --> 20:10.734
Look, however it played out,
Ivan is dead.

20:10.736 --> 20:13.336
ISIS has control of that oil.

20:13.338 --> 20:16.339
HETTY:
And they're about to expand
their war chest

20:16.341 --> 20:20.376
by $80 million.

20:20.378 --> 20:21.710
Hey. Check it out.

20:21.712 --> 20:23.712
I was able to configure
the Kremlin's CCTV feed

20:23.714 --> 20:25.980
to run through our
facial rec software.

20:25.982 --> 20:27.348
NELL:
Nice work, Beale.

20:27.350 --> 20:29.316
I've located the first group
of oil buyers

20:29.318 --> 20:31.251
from the list Pavel
gave us-- Chinese.

20:31.253 --> 20:32.252
They're on the move

20:32.254 --> 20:33.553
in the Red Square area.

20:33.554 --> 20:34.853
Hey, what about the group
from Cameroon?

20:34.856 --> 20:36.856
Uh, just arrived
at Sheremetyevo.

20:36.858 --> 20:38.724
All right. Pass the info
to Kensi and Deeks,

20:38.726 --> 20:40.792
and I'll let Hetty know.
Copy that.

20:40.794 --> 20:42.794
Trust her?

20:42.796 --> 20:46.464
No. But we know who
all the buyers are.

20:46.466 --> 20:48.466
If they all show up
at the same spot,

20:48.468 --> 20:50.601
her story starts to check out.

20:50.603 --> 20:53.370
(door opens)

21:01.012 --> 21:03.012
Let me guess.

21:03.014 --> 21:05.014
You don't trust me.

21:05.016 --> 21:07.716
Good instincts.

21:07.718 --> 21:10.685
But you need me.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.888
"Need" is a strong word.

21:14.857 --> 21:17.757
If I play nice, Hetty agreed

21:17.759 --> 21:20.292
to help me find a job
in the States.

21:20.294 --> 21:23.361
What happened to your whole
"army of one" thing?

21:23.363 --> 21:26.030
Just a walkabout.

21:26.032 --> 21:27.898
An experiment.

21:27.900 --> 21:32.002
Maybe we all do better
as part of a tribe.

21:32.004 --> 21:34.337
Tribes operate on trust.

21:36.741 --> 21:39.908
You came here with Arkady.

21:39.910 --> 21:43.811
Ever stop to think that it's me
who doesn't trust you?

21:43.813 --> 21:46.046
HETTY:
Mr. Callen!

21:46.048 --> 21:47.847
Mr. Hanna!

21:50.618 --> 21:52.951
GRANGER: You and Arkady
should go to the hotel,

21:52.953 --> 21:55.019
get Beale hooked
into their surveillance system.

21:55.021 --> 21:56.270
What hotel?

21:56.271 --> 21:57.520
NELL: The buyers from China
just arrived

21:57.523 --> 21:59.289
at the Red Street Hotel.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.690
G and I can hit the hotel.

22:00.692 --> 22:02.958
GRANGER: I need you to meet up
with Kensi and Deeks.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.694
They're gonna divert
the Cameroon buyers

22:05.696 --> 22:07.028
while the three of you
go into the hotel

22:07.030 --> 22:09.030
posing as the party
from Cameroon.

22:09.032 --> 22:10.331
CALLEN:
The three of us?

22:10.333 --> 22:12.633
You, Sam and Anna.

22:12.635 --> 22:15.669
Hey. So, the representative
of the buyer

22:15.671 --> 22:17.837
is Brice Nimbani. He,

22:17.839 --> 22:20.005
along with his girlfriend
and bodyguard,

22:20.007 --> 22:21.740
just arrived
at Sheremetyevo Airport.

22:21.742 --> 22:23.041
SAM:
Really?

22:23.043 --> 22:25.676
CALLEN:
This might be a stretch.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.378
NELL:
We're relying on the intel
that we have.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.847
The buyers' representatives
are not known by the sellers.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.816
I'm not gonna lie to you
and say it's great,

22:33.818 --> 22:36.451
but it's the best
play we have.

22:40.423 --> 22:43.690
And that's
happening today?

22:43.692 --> 22:46.092
Well, that's
very interesting, Eric.

22:46.094 --> 22:48.327
Thank you.

22:48.329 --> 22:49.928
(laughs)

22:49.930 --> 22:51.596
What is funny?

22:51.598 --> 22:53.497
Oh, nothing. Um,

22:53.499 --> 22:55.365
I just figured out
how we're going to get

22:55.367 --> 22:57.333
access to the back.

23:15.452 --> 23:17.552
Deeks and I are in position.

23:28.431 --> 23:30.764
He does this, Arkady.
Pops into my life,

23:30.766 --> 23:33.399
blows it up
and leaves.

23:33.401 --> 23:34.700
It's not our business.

23:34.702 --> 23:36.902
I'm not
a crazy person.

23:36.904 --> 23:38.436
That's good to know.

23:38.438 --> 23:39.904
(phone chimes)

23:40.973 --> 23:43.473
Hey. We should
check out that back room.

23:49.413 --> 23:51.880
It's a closed loop, Eric.
Information flows to me.

23:51.882 --> 23:53.481
Got it.

23:55.585 --> 23:57.084
What?

23:57.086 --> 24:00.153
You're using Eric's access
to the Kremlin's system

24:00.155 --> 24:02.155
to dig up information
about your father?

24:02.157 --> 24:03.689
Look, Sam...

24:03.691 --> 24:05.691
G, I'm not judging.

24:05.693 --> 24:09.428
I get it, but...
if he sets off a red flag,

24:09.430 --> 24:11.763
it'll make our stay in Russia
a little uncomfortable.

24:11.765 --> 24:15.133
He had to have escaped during
transport to the Gulag.

24:15.135 --> 24:17.101
That's why there's
no record of his death.

24:17.103 --> 24:19.970
He escaped, he took a new name,
he was home free.

24:19.972 --> 24:22.472
He could've lived
the rest of his life in peace

24:22.474 --> 24:24.106
on the beach,
in the south of France.

24:24.108 --> 24:25.274
He didn't leave.

24:25.275 --> 24:26.441
Yeah, he made sure
that other people

24:26.443 --> 24:28.176
had a chance to escape also.

24:28.178 --> 24:30.511
He was a good man.

24:30.513 --> 24:34.414
Yeah, well, maybe
he still is a good man.

24:34.416 --> 24:36.916
There's nothing to say
that he's dead.

24:36.918 --> 24:39.919
G...

24:39.921 --> 24:42.788
There's nothing to say
he's still alive, either.

25:00.541 --> 25:03.208
¶ ¶

25:18.558 --> 25:20.224
Hey!

25:29.034 --> 25:32.068
Cameroon buyers are secured.

25:41.979 --> 25:44.179
So Eric designed
a Trojan horse virus to give us

25:44.181 --> 25:46.114
the physical location of the
sellers.

25:46.116 --> 25:48.549
And if they didn't firewall
properly, we could also locate

25:48.551 --> 25:50.050
the three ships
carrying the oil.

25:50.052 --> 25:51.217
Sounds
easy enough.

25:51.219 --> 25:52.918
Eh, anything but.

25:52.920 --> 25:55.220
The buyers' terminals
aren't networked.

25:55.222 --> 25:57.255
Data's sent
via sat phone interface.

25:57.257 --> 25:59.523
And for the virus to work,
it's got to be placed

25:59.525 --> 26:00.690
at all five buyers' terminals

26:00.692 --> 26:02.658
using these... (clears throat)

26:02.660 --> 26:05.127
USB drives.
And each one

26:05.129 --> 26:07.629
of those five terminals
will be in a separate

26:07.631 --> 26:09.163
room of the hotel.
Exactly.

26:09.165 --> 26:10.531
Wow. Cakewalk.

26:10.533 --> 26:12.283
Oh, it gets better.

26:12.284 --> 26:14.034
In order for the virus
to give us the physical location

26:14.036 --> 26:16.936
of the sellers,
it must crash the auction.

26:16.938 --> 26:19.038
And when
that happens...

26:19.040 --> 26:20.506
When that happens,
the sellers run.

26:20.508 --> 26:22.007
We lose them,
we lose the oil.

26:22.009 --> 26:23.975
ISIS will not
resurface for the sale.

26:23.977 --> 26:26.811
They may blow up the oil in
a port city to make a statement.

26:26.813 --> 26:28.679
Well, let's hope that
Hetty can get Eric access

26:28.681 --> 26:30.113
to the hotel's
surveillance cams.

26:30.115 --> 26:32.849
Yeah, we're gonna need
eyes in the sky on this one.

26:48.799 --> 26:50.565
What am I doing here?

26:55.104 --> 26:57.904
No... Singing? I don't sing.

26:57.906 --> 27:01.707
From your diaphragm, Arkady.

27:01.709 --> 27:04.176
<i> Diaphragma.</i>

27:04.178 --> 27:07.245
Huh? (barks softly)

27:23.262 --> 27:25.828
(technicians conversing
indistinctly)

27:28.966 --> 27:30.966
¶ ¶

27:49.286 --> 27:51.819
(whispers):
Are we good, Eric?

27:51.821 --> 27:53.053
I have a signal.
One moment.

27:53.055 --> 27:55.055
All right, I'm in.
I have full access

27:55.057 --> 27:56.956
to the hotel's security cameras.

28:10.871 --> 28:12.871
(French accent):
Mr. Bukin.
Yes.

28:12.873 --> 28:14.772
I was told
to tell you that

28:14.774 --> 28:16.940
your friends
in Cameroon appreciate

28:16.942 --> 28:20.076
any hospitality
that you could show us.

28:21.279 --> 28:23.879
We expected you earlier.

28:23.881 --> 28:25.046
We're here now.

28:25.048 --> 28:27.748
Hm.

28:27.750 --> 28:29.316
Of course you are.

28:29.318 --> 28:33.019
I've taken the liberty
of putting you in Room 201.

28:33.021 --> 28:35.387
<i> Merci.</i>
<i> De rien.</i>

28:38.191 --> 28:39.223
Let's see how many thugs

28:39.225 --> 28:41.024
each buyer sent.
NELL: Good idea.

28:41.026 --> 28:43.292
then I'll track 'em and
see which rooms they went into.

28:44.261 --> 28:46.060
Got 'em.

28:46.062 --> 28:48.095
Keep an eye out
for the next set of buyers.

28:48.097 --> 28:49.162
Yeah.

28:54.135 --> 28:55.868
They're in room 318.

29:07.214 --> 29:09.280
All right...

29:09.282 --> 29:12.283
we've got four minutes until the
computer's live for the auction.

29:12.285 --> 29:14.952
Auction begins,
I insert the USB drive

29:14.954 --> 29:16.386
and download the virus.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.755
Place a bid
and 60 seconds later,

29:18.757 --> 29:19.856
the jig is up.

29:19.858 --> 29:21.057
I walk away.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.992
That's about it.

29:22.994 --> 29:26.061
Trust is based on actions,

29:26.063 --> 29:27.762
not words.

29:27.764 --> 29:30.965
Nothing I can say to make
you think different than you do.

29:38.507 --> 29:41.441
You'll be able to hear and talk
with the rest of the team.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.880
NELL: Okay guys, I've got
the first set of rooms.

29:48.882 --> 29:51.882
Room 318 and 401.

29:53.352 --> 29:54.551
Good luck.

30:01.326 --> 30:03.859
Callen, looks like
the safest way to breach 318

30:03.861 --> 30:06.328
is gonna be through
the balcony, and room 320

30:06.330 --> 30:07.929
is being cleaned,
so you can enter through there.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.230
CALLEN:
Copy.

30:09.232 --> 30:11.498
Okay, Sam, room 401--

30:11.500 --> 30:13.366
it's a suite and it's isolated.

30:13.368 --> 30:16.469
Best bet is shock and awe
straight through the front door.

30:16.471 --> 30:17.803
SAM:
I got it, Nell. Moving now.

30:17.805 --> 30:19.171
Okay, talk to me, Eric.

30:19.173 --> 30:21.506
There it is.
Third room is 120.

30:21.508 --> 30:24.008
Kensi, take 120.
It's a courtyard room

30:24.010 --> 30:25.943
with an exterior door.

30:25.944 --> 30:27.877
KENSI: Copy that.
Fourth room, here we go-- 215.

30:27.880 --> 30:28.945
Deeks, you're up.

30:28.947 --> 30:31.414
Room 215.
It's a corner suite.

30:31.416 --> 30:34.016
You're gonna want to come at it
from the third floor.

30:34.018 --> 30:36.451
There's a window
directly over 215's balcony.

30:36.453 --> 30:39.287
DEEKS:
On my way.

30:39.289 --> 30:42.023
NELL:
All right. The goal for the next
two minutes is to stay

30:42.025 --> 30:45.159
under the radar.
Gunfire is our last resort.

31:08.284 --> 31:09.449
(grunts)

31:09.451 --> 31:12.552
The team is in position.

31:12.554 --> 31:13.486
Go.

31:17.958 --> 31:20.058
(grunting)

31:27.299 --> 31:28.531
Aah!

31:28.533 --> 31:30.366
(man speaks Russian)

31:36.440 --> 31:38.573
Aah!
(grunting)

31:42.445 --> 31:44.645
(groans)

31:44.647 --> 31:46.146
Oh!

31:46.148 --> 31:48.047
(man groans)

31:50.618 --> 31:51.917
(grunting)

31:54.521 --> 31:57.488
(moans)

32:11.002 --> 32:13.268
All the drives are placed.
Virus downloading.

32:13.270 --> 32:15.403
NELL:
Good.

32:15.405 --> 32:17.338
(singing in Russian)

32:19.241 --> 32:21.341
(groaning quietly)

32:22.644 --> 32:24.543
Time to go.

32:24.545 --> 32:26.278
Thank you.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.646
And thank you.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.349
50 seconds until
the sellers know we're here.

32:32.351 --> 32:33.650
Thanks.
Just amp up the pressure.

32:33.652 --> 32:36.619
Sorry.
Just updating the team.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.288
The virus is working,
it's narrowing the field.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.123
The sellers are on
the same block as the hotel.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.624
30 seconds.

32:42.626 --> 32:44.125
Sellers aren't moving.

32:44.127 --> 32:46.293
They're within
100 yards of the hotel.

32:46.295 --> 32:47.627
We need to know
the location of the sellers

32:47.629 --> 32:49.562
before they know their system's
been compromised.

32:49.564 --> 32:50.963
Again-- not helping.

32:50.965 --> 32:52.664
GRANGER: And get the team
out of the hotel.

32:52.666 --> 32:53.931
Standing by
for the location.

32:53.933 --> 32:55.132
ERIC:
No, don't do that.

32:55.134 --> 32:56.233
What?

32:56.235 --> 32:57.667
The sellers
are inside the hotel.

32:57.669 --> 32:58.567
Room 190.

32:58.569 --> 33:00.368
Guys, room 190.

33:09.278 --> 33:11.044
The sellers' signal's
still active.

33:11.046 --> 33:13.613
They're still in the room.
ERIC: Yeah.

33:21.688 --> 33:23.087
KENSI:
Clear!

33:25.524 --> 33:27.590
Eric, the room's empty.

33:38.736 --> 33:40.435
Talk to me. Where are they?

33:40.437 --> 33:42.336
Searching now.
Yeah, we don't have a view

33:42.338 --> 33:44.971
of their door, but no one came
down that hallway to the lobby.

33:44.973 --> 33:46.138
There. Underground garage.

33:47.474 --> 33:50.541
GRANGER: We've got three men
just entered a black van.

33:55.548 --> 33:57.614
Go, go.

33:57.616 --> 34:01.484
(tires screeching
in distance)

34:25.709 --> 34:27.041
KENSI:
Hold your fire!

34:29.345 --> 34:32.279
(grunting)

34:44.426 --> 34:46.225
ARKADY:
Anna!

34:54.235 --> 34:55.200
Clear.

35:02.608 --> 35:04.741
(raspy sigh, quiet groan)

35:04.743 --> 35:06.042
Anna.

35:11.782 --> 35:14.048
HETTY:
How bad?

35:14.050 --> 35:16.583
Took a round in the abdomen.

35:16.585 --> 35:18.484
Two in the right arm.

35:18.486 --> 35:20.785
Losing lots of blood.

35:23.656 --> 35:25.822
The Politsiya are closing in.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.456
I'll carry you. Let's go.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.258
(sirens wailing in distance)
No. They are almost here.

35:30.260 --> 35:31.525
Leave me.

35:31.527 --> 35:32.692
That's not happening.

35:32.694 --> 35:35.561
Leave me... (panting)

35:35.563 --> 35:37.229
If I am here,

35:37.231 --> 35:40.098
I can stall them.

35:40.100 --> 35:42.500
I can... give you some time.

35:42.502 --> 35:44.335
Go.

35:44.337 --> 35:46.303
(sirens approaching)

35:46.305 --> 35:48.238
We need to move.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.139
No. I'll stay.

35:50.141 --> 35:51.473
No. You cannot.

35:51.475 --> 35:54.576
They will have
too many questions for you.

35:54.578 --> 35:56.744
Yeah.

35:56.746 --> 35:59.313
Walk away.

35:59.315 --> 36:01.347
All right. Anna, come on.

36:04.618 --> 36:06.784
Come on. Please.
Let's go.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.766
¶ ¶

36:45.321 --> 36:48.655
We're still looking,
but, uh, Anna's in the wind.

36:48.657 --> 36:52.725
My guess is she's using her own
contacts to try and find Arkady.

36:53.627 --> 36:56.561
Arkady is alive.

36:56.563 --> 36:59.764
But he seems
to be keeping his mouth shut.

36:59.766 --> 37:02.433
Our names haven't been flagged.

37:02.435 --> 37:05.169
Okay.

37:05.171 --> 37:06.703
Sam and I will stay back.

37:06.705 --> 37:08.871
We'll locate him.
We'll get him out.

37:08.873 --> 37:12.207
We've worn out our welcome here,
Mr. Callen.

37:12.209 --> 37:13.575
We're not gonna
just leave him here.

37:13.577 --> 37:17.579
Arkady has many friends here.

37:17.581 --> 37:22.416
Friends that profit more
when he's not in custody.

37:24.353 --> 37:26.653
(sighs)
On a better note...

37:26.655 --> 37:29.656
Eric has the names

37:29.658 --> 37:32.592
of the ships carrying
the stolen oil.

37:32.594 --> 37:35.728
The Navy is en route to
intercept and secure them.

37:40.234 --> 37:41.566
(sighs)

37:44.637 --> 37:46.369
This place is special to you.

37:49.540 --> 37:51.172
I was married here.

37:51.174 --> 37:53.340
What?!

37:55.544 --> 37:59.812
The... ceremony was here.

37:59.814 --> 38:01.747
To who?

38:01.749 --> 38:04.316
It was

38:04.317 --> 38:06.884
all part of a...
an undercover assignment.

38:09.789 --> 38:11.321
(grunts)

38:15.660 --> 38:17.794
And it meant nothing to you.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.364
Nothing.

38:25.869 --> 38:29.871
I know you asked Eric to
look into information

38:29.873 --> 38:31.939
about your father.

38:31.941 --> 38:34.775
If there's any chance
my father's alive then...

38:34.777 --> 38:37.911
But I told
Mr. Beale not to look into it,

38:37.913 --> 38:40.847
because I wanted to do it.

38:40.849 --> 38:44.083
So, the man

38:44.085 --> 38:48.687
whom Arkady dealt with,
in Russia, until 1988,

38:48.689 --> 38:53.657
is named Konstantin Chernoff.

38:53.659 --> 38:56.760
But there are
no records of

38:56.762 --> 39:01.830
any man by that name
before 1974.

39:02.933 --> 39:06.935
The year Nikita Reznikov
was sent to the Gulag.

39:06.937 --> 39:07.869
Yes.

39:07.871 --> 39:09.070
My father escaped,

39:09.072 --> 39:13.940
dropped the name Reznikov.

39:13.942 --> 39:16.075
Took the name Chernoff

39:16.077 --> 39:19.078
and...
Helped many, many people

39:19.080 --> 39:21.947
escape to the West.

39:21.949 --> 39:24.950
He lived in Ruza,

39:24.952 --> 39:28.053
about an hour west of here.

39:28.055 --> 39:29.888
"Lived"?

39:29.890 --> 39:33.491
Mr. Callen,

39:33.493 --> 39:36.827
your father died in 2008.

39:37.896 --> 39:42.965
He's buried in the little
town cemetery at Ruza.

39:50.907 --> 39:54.708
I was here...

39:54.710 --> 39:57.711
in Moscow, for-for years,

39:57.713 --> 40:00.046
when he was still alive.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.416
(grunts, sighs)

40:06.153 --> 40:09.420
I need to, uh...

40:10.156 --> 40:12.422
Hetty, uh...

40:12.424 --> 40:14.424
Yes, go.

40:14.426 --> 40:16.025
We leave tonight.

40:26.771 --> 40:28.837
¶ ¶

40:51.428 --> 40:52.493
(sighs)

41:12.948 --> 41:14.881
G.

41:16.551 --> 41:18.717
Let's go home.

41:18.719 --> 41:20.785
Yeah.

41:30.529 --> 41:32.595
