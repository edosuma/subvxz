Merry Christmas.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.916
Ah! This is what you wear
to  Christmas dinner?

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Don't you even own a dress?

00:46.083 --> 00:47.666
I'm great, Mom. Thanks.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.500
House looks beautiful.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.416
Well, your Aunt Susan
brought at-the-mall-Santa home.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.333
[Susan chuckles]

00:53.416 --> 00:55.541
And your nephew just pooped in the manger.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.375
Ugh. It was a tiny poop,

00:57.458 --> 00:59.416
and he moved the baby Jesus first.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.750
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:00.833 --> 01:02.125
Merry Christmas.

01:02.208 --> 01:03.833
-Gingerbread elf?
-Oh!

01:04.666 --> 01:05.541
-Wow.
-Hey.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.083
Um, Rodney said you didn't call him.

01:08.250 --> 01:10.750
I'm sorry,
but I cannot date a professional clown.

01:10.833 --> 01:11.666
I'd never sleep.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.916
Jesus, Sloane, it's been six months.
You gotta get back out there.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.666
How does she expect to meet anybody

01:16.750 --> 01:19.166
when she sits around the house
wearing pajamas?

01:19.250 --> 01:20.958
It's called working remote, Mother.

01:21.041 --> 01:24.250
My boss doesn't care what I wear
as long as I meet my quota.

01:24.333 --> 01:27.875
He does, however, request that my mother
stop FaceTiming me during business hours.

01:27.958 --> 01:29.916
You're not still smoking, are you?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.416
Uh... No, Mom. I'm not still smoking.

01:32.833 --> 01:34.458
I had a smoky Uber.

01:34.541 --> 01:37.000
Well, I know the holidays
can be stressful,

01:37.083 --> 01:39.750
but no man wants to marry a smoker...

01:41.791 --> 01:42.791
who lies.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.208
Well, no man wants a bitchy mother-in-law.

01:47.291 --> 01:49.041
So, I guess that's three strikes.

01:51.125 --> 01:52.458
Woo-hoo hoo-hoo!

01:52.750 --> 01:55.125
You know it's a holiday
when my sister shows up alone.

01:55.208 --> 01:57.458
-Don't rub it in. She's obviously sad.
-Stop it.

01:57.541 --> 01:58.750
I'm not sad.

01:58.833 --> 02:00.541
Are you sure? You look really sad.

02:00.625 --> 02:01.458
Uh-uh.

02:01.666 --> 02:02.666
I'm not sad.

02:02.750 --> 02:06.291
[man] Boom! One sanitized manger.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.250
[chuckles] Aw, Sloane.

02:09.291 --> 02:10.458
You didn't call Rodney?

02:13.458 --> 02:14.541
[Susan] Isn't he great?

02:14.625 --> 02:16.541
-Hmm.
-I met him at the mall.

02:16.875 --> 02:20.250
You'd be surprised at the quality of men
you can meet at the mall.

02:20.333 --> 02:23.000
[sighs] I don't think I would actually.

02:23.083 --> 02:23.916
Relax.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.333
It's not like I'm going to marry him.

02:26.958 --> 02:28.333
He's just my holidate.

02:28.916 --> 02:29.958
A "holidate"?

02:30.041 --> 02:32.291
You know, a date solely for the holiday.

02:32.625 --> 02:33.458
No commitment.

02:34.708 --> 02:36.416
Want me to see if he has a friend?

02:47.083 --> 02:49.125
[woman] Don't be nervous.
They'll love you.

02:49.208 --> 02:52.125
[in Australian accent] Your parents know
this is only our third date, right?

02:52.208 --> 02:53.583
Oh, my God. It's not a big deal.

02:53.666 --> 02:55.583
Actually,
I don't think they know you're coming.

02:55.666 --> 02:58.958
-Hi! Merry Christmas!
-[both] Merry Christmas!

02:59.041 --> 03:01.041
[all laughing]

03:01.125 --> 03:03.125
Oh, and you must be Jackson.

03:03.541 --> 03:05.875
You're even more handsome
than in the pictures.

03:05.958 --> 03:06.916
[chuckles]

03:07.458 --> 03:08.375
Pictures?

03:10.166 --> 03:13.625
Oh, and her first time on Santa's lap.

03:13.708 --> 03:17.708
She peed right through to Santa's leg.
[laughs]

03:18.125 --> 03:21.625
Ah, first ballet recital and...

03:21.708 --> 03:22.583
Oh!

03:23.000 --> 03:25.333
this is the day she got her first period.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.125
[Jackson] Charming.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.166
Oh, and this one...

03:30.583 --> 03:32.916
was for Little Miss Evanston.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.125
[chuckles]

03:36.833 --> 03:37.916
You should know,

03:40.083 --> 03:42.750
Carly's father and I
are perfectly comfortable

03:42.833 --> 03:44.916
with you two sleeping together in here.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.916
Oh, no. It's fine.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.625
I won't be staying over.

03:49.708 --> 03:51.333
[scoffs] Nonsense.

03:51.416 --> 03:53.125
You're practically family.

04:01.625 --> 04:02.625

-Yeah?

04:11.375 --> 04:13.666
Stop being a baby. We can put the leaf in.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.208
No, thank you.
I prefer the singles table.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.375
[sighs]

04:17.458 --> 04:21.166
All right, kids, let's check on presents.
Come on. Let's go.

04:22.041 --> 04:22.875
So...

04:23.583 --> 04:26.500
Aunt Sloane, why didn't you call Rodney?

04:27.041 --> 04:29.041
Why didn't you call Rodney?

04:29.125 --> 04:30.916
Because I already have a boyfriend.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.458
His name is Levi,

04:32.541 --> 04:35.666
and he shares his juice box with me
every day at recess.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.250
Good for you, Daisy.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.208
You enjoy it while you can,

04:40.541 --> 04:42.791
because one day you are gonna
walk outside,

04:42.875 --> 04:45.416
and you're gonna catch Levi
sharing his juice box

04:45.500 --> 04:47.583
with a Starbucks barista named "Rainbow."

04:48.250 --> 04:50.291
Yeah, it's not a good day, Daisy.

04:50.375 --> 04:51.500
It hurts.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.625
It hardens you.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.750
And the next thing you know,

04:54.833 --> 04:56.083
you're just south of 30,

04:56.166 --> 04:59.083
sitting at the kids table,
numbing the pain with a vodka.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.583
[slurping]

05:00.666 --> 05:02.541
God, my parents love you!

05:02.625 --> 05:04.583
What the hell is wrong with you?
You told them--

05:04.666 --> 05:07.250
-You told your parents we're a couple?
-Oh, come on.

05:07.958 --> 05:09.500
You know you like me.

05:09.583 --> 05:12.083
You wouldn't be here on a major holiday

05:12.166 --> 05:14.416
-if you didn't like me.
-I--

05:14.833 --> 05:16.958
[gasps] A Clapper?

05:17.041 --> 05:18.958

my parents are  in Australia.

-I didn't have any other...

[women] Ooh!

05:29.125 --> 05:31.041
-Hey!
-Ah!

05:31.375 --> 05:32.708
-Pajamas.
-Yes!

05:32.791 --> 05:37.166
I thought they were so cute and cozy
for, like, a girl's night in.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.208
[both chuckle]

05:40.875 --> 05:42.083
Hey!

05:43.791 --> 05:46.000
-Pants.
-They're khakis!

05:46.916 --> 05:49.083
Because golfers love khakis, right?

05:49.166 --> 05:51.958
I didn't know the size so I got three,
but you can exchange them.

05:52.708 --> 05:53.625
Pants...

05:54.083 --> 05:56.041
-and a project.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.916
I'm sorry. I really didn't...

06:07.833 --> 06:09.666
think we're doing the whole present thing.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.666
[scoffs] Why would you think that?

06:13.583 --> 06:16.083
Because you said we're not doing
the whole present thing.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.041
Oh!

06:19.791 --> 06:22.875
I see. So, you know me well enough
to cum in my mouth,

06:22.958 --> 06:25.583
but you don't know me well enough
to get me a Christmas present?

06:25.916 --> 06:27.125
[stutters] I--

06:28.708 --> 06:30.875
I could give you some cash.
I've got, what--

06:31.875 --> 06:33.583
What have I got left? Forty bucks?

06:34.083 --> 06:35.166
Forty bucks?

06:36.375 --> 06:37.750
What am I, a prostitute?

06:38.500 --> 06:39.916
No! God, no!

06:40.041 --> 06:41.625
Absolutely not. What the--

06:42.250 --> 06:43.416
I'll take 80.

06:44.333 --> 06:45.166
[scoffs]

06:45.666 --> 06:47.333
I'm not giving you $80.

06:47.833 --> 06:50.291
But we had sex, Jackson! Twice!

06:50.375 --> 06:54.208
I cannot believe that you didn't
get me a Christmas present!

06:54.291 --> 06:55.583
I can't believe

06:55.666 --> 06:58.500
that you'd ambush me like this
in front of your parents!

06:58.583 --> 07:01.166
Actually, you know what? I can.

07:01.666 --> 07:04.208
'Cause chicks go mental on the holidays.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.500
Lovely evening, guys. Beautiful dinner.
Have a merry Christmas.

-[boy clears throat]

07:21.625 --> 07:23.333
Could I have everyone's attention?

07:24.291 --> 07:26.166
There's something that I need to say.

07:26.250 --> 07:27.500
Who wants dessert?

07:28.500 --> 07:29.708
[chuckles] Oh!

07:30.875 --> 07:31.708
Oh!

07:32.833 --> 07:34.166
Elizabeth Kimberly Chen...

07:35.125 --> 07:36.375
Fuck no.

07:36.833 --> 07:38.833
I know it's been only been three months

07:38.916 --> 07:40.333
and six heavenly days,

07:40.916 --> 07:43.250
but I feel like I've known you
my entire life.

07:43.875 --> 07:46.125
Will you make me
the happiest man in the world

07:46.625 --> 07:47.541
and marry me?

07:47.625 --> 07:49.250
[Liz] Oh, my gosh!
-[gasps]

07:49.708 --> 07:50.541

Yes, I'll marry you!

-Two down, one to go!
-Congratulations.

-Yes!

Wow, this is... awesome.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.708
[all cheering and laughing]

08:06.958 --> 08:08.000
Wow! I just...

08:09.250 --> 08:10.875
love these pajamas.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.083
-[man] What’s the hold up?
-[woman] This is ridiculous.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.958
[Jackson] I've been in line
over half an hour. Please--

08:20.041 --> 08:23.125
I'm sorry, without a gift receipt
I can only offer you a store credit.

08:23.541 --> 08:25.333
I don't want a store credit.

08:25.791 --> 08:28.166
I want to never have to return
to this store.

08:28.250 --> 08:31.833
We have some really cute stuff.
Have you tried our authentic skinny jeans?

08:32.250 --> 08:33.333
[Sloane] Excuse me!

08:33.458 --> 08:34.666
[woman] Come on, dude!

08:34.750 --> 08:35.916
Crocodile Dundee,

08:36.000 --> 08:37.708
some of us have jobs.

08:37.791 --> 08:39.041
Dundee. Original.

08:39.875 --> 08:42.291
Hang on. What makes you think
I don't have a job?

08:43.250 --> 08:45.125
You're at the mall on a Wednesday

08:45.208 --> 08:46.708
returning slacker pants.

08:46.791 --> 08:49.541
Uh... These happen to be khakis.

08:49.625 --> 08:52.500
[with thick Australian accent]
Lots of employed people wear khaki pants.

08:52.583 --> 08:55.250
Hopefully, you mean khakis
and still don't care.

08:55.708 --> 08:57.833
Hi, there. I just have a quick return.

08:57.916 --> 08:58.750
Hey!

08:58.833 --> 09:01.125
-Receipt?
-They didn't come with a receipt.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.666
Just the assumption
that I would be alone forever

09:03.750 --> 09:07.416
and, apparently, gorge myself
into the size of a lumberjack.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.958
Nailed it.

09:09.041 --> 09:09.875
[chuckles]

09:10.500 --> 09:13.375
You know what?
My Christmas already sucked.

09:13.458 --> 09:16.125
So, you can go "nail it" somewhere else.

09:16.208 --> 09:17.833
Uh, I need to go check on these.

09:17.916 --> 09:19.000
[indistinct chatter]

09:21.208 --> 09:24.916
I'll give you 40 bucks for those khakis,
and a Fresh Pretzel, two-for-one.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.666
This is like 80 bucks worth of pants.

09:27.750 --> 09:28.583
No deal.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.750
Hey, if it's any consolation,

09:35.291 --> 09:38.291
I spent my holiday
in an ugly Christmas sweater,

09:38.791 --> 09:42.375
sipping mocktails with a room
full of people who I think were in a cult.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.500
I'll see your ugly Christmas sweater,

09:45.583 --> 09:48.125
and raise you a seat at the kids table,

09:48.208 --> 09:49.958
my little brother getting engaged,

09:50.041 --> 09:52.958
and catching my aunt
getting her cookie licked by a mall Santa.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.625
That's a... festive visual.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.125
Seared into my brain like a bad tattoo.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.541
I got a bad tattoo once.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.208
Is that... Matt Lauer?

10:06.791 --> 10:08.916
I was a really big fan of the Today Show.

10:10.083 --> 10:12.875
Sorry, these are from two seasons ago.

10:12.958 --> 10:15.375
I can offer you a store credit

10:15.458 --> 10:17.333
at the current sales price of...

10:17.916 --> 10:20.000
[gasps] $4.99!

10:20.083 --> 10:22.083
[mouthing]

10:22.291 --> 10:23.375
$4.99?

10:23.875 --> 10:26.333
Four dollars and ninety-nine cents.
[scoffs]

10:26.416 --> 10:28.791
My sister has become so cheap
since having kids.

10:28.875 --> 10:32.083
It'd be really cute if you
cut off the legs, like capri pants.

10:34.458 --> 10:35.875
Fifty bucks for everything.

10:35.958 --> 10:37.708
-Hey!
-Like you're making capri pants.

10:37.791 --> 10:38.958
I might.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.250
I have a crafty side.

10:40.333 --> 10:41.416
Okay.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.333
Forty.

10:42.791 --> 10:43.791
Forty-five!

10:44.375 --> 10:45.875
And the pretzels, two-for-one.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.291
-You don't want any?
-I don't eat that crap.

10:49.375 --> 10:51.833
-Do you know what that does to your body?
-Yeah.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.333
It fills me with warm,
delicious happiness.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.166
Like Christmas used to,
before I realized Santa was a big scam.

10:58.250 --> 10:59.083
[chuckles] Yeah.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.375
Christmas peaked for me at about ten.

11:01.458 --> 11:04.708
I got a surfboard
and my first complete set of golf clubs.

11:04.791 --> 11:05.708
[Sloane] Hmm.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.458
-It was good.
-My best Christmas...

11:08.250 --> 11:10.958
was a Barbie Dream House, preassembled,

11:11.750 --> 11:14.416
and a ventriloquist puppet named Lester.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.791
[Sloane] He looked like Jaleel White.

11:16.875 --> 11:17.708
Hmm?

11:18.208 --> 11:19.875
I sort of had a thing for Urkel.

11:19.958 --> 11:22.250
I spent months learning to throw my voice.

11:22.583 --> 11:24.291
-Well, come on, let's hear it.
-No.

11:24.958 --> 11:26.916
Excuse me. I bought you a free pretzel.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.250
So, you owe me an Urkel.

11:29.666 --> 11:30.500
Come on.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.291
Come on.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.208
[clears throat]

11:34.083 --> 11:35.833
[in monotone voice]
Did I do that?

11:37.375 --> 11:39.125
Did I do that?

11:39.208 --> 11:40.250
Nice.

11:40.958 --> 11:43.875
-What happened to Lester?
-Oh, he sleeps with me every night.

11:43.958 --> 11:44.958
What?

11:45.583 --> 11:47.166
Hey, Sloane!

11:48.125 --> 11:50.291
Oh, God! Oh, God!

11:50.375 --> 11:52.750
Is that an ex-boyfriend of yours
or something?

11:53.250 --> 11:55.958
No! That is the guy my aunt
brought home for Christmas.

11:56.833 --> 11:58.083
That's the cookie licker?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.250
Tell your Aunt Susan to call me!

12:00.333 --> 12:02.000
[Sloane] He was her holidate.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.458
Wait. What's a holidate?

12:03.791 --> 12:06.333
Just some guy she picked up at the mall
to spend Christmas with.

12:07.458 --> 12:09.958
Wait, just Christmas or all holidays?

12:10.041 --> 12:11.416
Easter, New Year's...

12:11.916 --> 12:14.000
She's an equal opportunity holi-dater.

12:14.416 --> 12:16.458
That's what I need for New Year's Eve.

12:16.541 --> 12:19.125
You can try, but this late in the game,
he's probably booked.

12:19.208 --> 12:23.125
No. Seriously, I am done
casually dating on the holidays.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.083
There's way too much pressure.
It's ridiculous.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.750
I always end up being the asshole
at the end of the day, anyway.

12:27.833 --> 12:31.083
Yeah? Well, try being the only
single person left in your family.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.500
Every time I walk into a room,

12:32.583 --> 12:35.583
I'm showered in a sea of pity
and sad glances.

12:35.666 --> 12:38.791
I mean, why is everyone so suspicious
of a happy, single woman?

12:39.250 --> 12:40.750
Because you're obviously not happy.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.625
[chuckles] Yes, I am.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.083
Hmm ... Happy.

12:44.708 --> 12:45.541
No, you're not.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.208
Human beings aren't meant to be alone
on the holidays.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.166
We actually need

12:51.583 --> 12:52.666
warmth,

12:53.208 --> 12:54.333
companionship,

12:55.166 --> 12:57.750
and someone
to drunk-mock strangers with at parties.

12:58.666 --> 13:01.541
I do enjoy
drunk-mocking strangers at parties.

13:02.125 --> 13:05.500
Well, then, this is perfect! We can be
each other's holidate for New Year's Eve.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.333
[chuckles] I don't even know you, so...

13:07.416 --> 13:09.750
Yeah, well, that's what makes it perfect.

13:09.833 --> 13:12.791
'Cause there's no pressure.
There's no expectations.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.000
I mean... I don't even think
I find you that attractive.

13:17.041 --> 13:18.416
Wow! Calm down with the flattery.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.166
Not that you're not attractive.
It's just that maybe...

13:21.583 --> 13:22.916
you're not that attractive to me.

13:24.583 --> 13:25.416
Goodbye!

13:26.833 --> 13:32.208
Okay, wait a second. You just said
that you're tired of all the sad glances

13:32.291 --> 13:34.625
-and looking pathetic.
-"Pity," not "pathetic."

13:34.708 --> 13:36.208
Okay, tomato, tomato.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.958
I've got tickets to the Skyfall party.

13:39.041 --> 13:40.250
-Wait, really?
-Yeah.

13:40.333 --> 13:41.666
That's such a fun party.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.833
-Oh, come on, then say yes.
-Ugh!

13:43.916 --> 13:45.291
I just wanna go.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.625
I wanna relax, have a few drinks.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.416
Not worry about my date

13:49.500 --> 13:52.500
going batshit
if I don't drop a knee at midnight.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.083
What makes you sure I'm not batshit?

13:56.750 --> 13:58.125
You had me at Lester.

14:00.166 --> 14:01.416
I'm Jackson, by the way.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.000
Sloane.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.833
Nice to meet you, Sloane.

14:04.916 --> 14:06.625
Here are my details.

14:07.625 --> 14:08.500
"Golf pro?"

14:09.541 --> 14:10.666
What's your real job?

14:10.750 --> 14:12.375
Just think about it and text me.

14:13.916 --> 14:15.541
Not texting you, Tiger Woods.

14:16.041 --> 14:18.125
-Think about it.
-Not texting you!

14:18.208 --> 14:19.458
Just send me a text.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.958
[Sloane] Uh... I'm almost finished.

14:22.458 --> 14:25.708
We are right on target
for queue three, and--

14:25.791 --> 14:26.750
[computer ringing]

14:27.166 --> 14:28.041
[beeps]

14:28.125 --> 14:31.291
I'll have those numbers
teed up first thing in the morning.

14:31.375 --> 14:32.916
[computer ringing]

14:33.000 --> 14:34.083
I'm sorry. Can I...

14:34.708 --> 14:35.833
call you back?

14:36.333 --> 14:37.166
Yeah.

14:37.958 --> 14:39.375
Mom, I'm working!

14:39.750 --> 14:41.208
That's what you wear to work?

14:41.625 --> 14:43.541
You could at least put on a nice top.

14:44.041 --> 14:46.083
Honey, I want you to meet someone.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.750
This my new neighbor, Faarooq.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.833
-[Faarooq] Hello.
-Faarooq is a doctor,

14:52.916 --> 14:53.833
and he's single.

14:54.958 --> 14:57.083
She's much prettier with makeup.

14:57.166 --> 14:58.333
I'm wearing makeup!

14:58.708 --> 15:01.958
-Faarooq is free on New Year's--
-Goodbye, Mother.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.666
And so, I thought that--

15:04.166 --> 15:05.375
[sighs deeply]

15:17.291 --> 15:19.458
[man chuckles] Almost got me
on that one. No.

15:19.541 --> 15:21.041
Nope! Okay.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.541
Eh... nope.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.333
Maybe!

15:24.416 --> 15:25.416
No.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.041
Uh-uh. Mm.

15:27.541 --> 15:29.291
How do you say "no" in Italian?

15:29.375 --> 15:30.541
"No, grazie."

15:30.625 --> 15:31.666
[both chuckle]

15:32.041 --> 15:34.041
Nah. Oh. Oh!

15:34.125 --> 15:35.916
She is fine!

15:36.000 --> 15:37.708
And she got a little baby goat!

15:37.791 --> 15:40.166
Didn't you hook up with her
last month at the pro-am?

15:41.375 --> 15:42.208
Didn't you?

15:45.666 --> 15:47.958
Oh, I did!

15:48.041 --> 15:49.958
She must've left the goat at home.

15:50.041 --> 15:53.250
-I should give her a call--
-Why are you using my account anyway?

15:53.416 --> 15:54.458
Because I told you,

15:54.541 --> 15:57.708
I have some obsessive exes
that just can't get rid of this.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.166
-Okay?
-Know what the problem is with girls?

16:00.250 --> 16:02.250
They got these crazy eyes, right?

16:02.333 --> 16:05.500
They're real,
and... I don't need a real girl.

16:06.583 --> 16:08.750
-I need a holidate.
-You said a what-a-date?

16:08.833 --> 16:10.041
[phone ringing]

16:11.458 --> 16:12.500
Hello?

16:16.916 --> 16:18.750
I thought I said text me, not call me.

16:18.833 --> 16:20.750
What's "holidate"?

16:20.833 --> 16:22.750
Is that a new app I need to download?

16:23.125 --> 16:24.333
I cannot keep up.

16:24.875 --> 16:28.875
-[all cheering]
-[dance music playing]

16:31.375 --> 16:33.375
I think the leather-vest-mate's up now.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.375
Oh, okay, he's an options trader.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.458
Divorced. Two kids at Northwestern.

16:37.958 --> 16:41.541
She was his decorator on the new condo,

16:41.625 --> 16:44.625
-hoping to be wife number three.
-Very good. Very good.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.083
Ooh, uh, white satin ruffles.

16:48.166 --> 16:49.250
Rented tuxedo.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.500
He's just drenched in sweat.

16:51.583 --> 16:54.041
They are definitely getting engaged
at midnight.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.291
[indistinct chatter]

16:55.791 --> 16:56.875
[Sloane] Wow.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.666
-You're good.
-It's a gift.

17:01.250 --> 17:04.916
By the way, your tits
look exceptional in that dress.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.791
Thanks. That's why I bought it.

17:06.875 --> 17:09.041
[sighs] Love the way it hugs
your ass, too.

17:09.541 --> 17:11.166
That's really sweet of you to notice.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.791
[chuckles] This is great.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.708
I love it. I just can say whatever I want

17:14.791 --> 17:17.000
'cause I don't care
if you think I'm a classy guy or not.

17:17.083 --> 17:20.500
And I can wear a slutty dress
and not worry about being slut-shamed.

17:20.583 --> 17:21.541
What a holidate bonus.

17:21.625 --> 17:22.458
[Sloane] Hmm.

17:24.458 --> 17:25.416
[Jackson] Ooh.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.750
Okay, so he is
a sexually confused art student

17:29.208 --> 17:30.458
with mommy issues.

17:30.541 --> 17:31.833
And she's a wealthy widow

17:31.916 --> 17:34.083
with a taste for bondage.
[mimics whipcrack]

17:34.166 --> 17:35.166
Aunt Susan?

17:35.250 --> 17:36.833
[gasps] Sloane!

17:36.916 --> 17:38.666
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.791
-Oh, baby.
-Wow.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.666
-Your tits look great in that dress.
-[Sloane chuckles]

17:43.750 --> 17:44.916
That's what I said.

17:45.375 --> 17:46.916
This is... Ronnie.

17:47.958 --> 17:48.791
Robert.

17:49.416 --> 17:50.416
-Hello.
-Hi.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.916
We met at the Art Institute.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.041
I was a nude model
for his figure sculpting class.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.875
He made me the most perfect clay clitoris.

17:58.416 --> 18:00.583
Like a butterfly taking flight.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.000
[sighs] You have to see it.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.375
Pass. Thanks. [chuckles]

18:04.458 --> 18:05.833
I'd love to see that.

18:06.291 --> 18:07.416
That can be arranged.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.666
Well, Happy New Year, you kids. Have fun.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.375
Come on, Francois.

18:13.916 --> 18:15.083
Your aunt seems nice.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.458
[sighs] I need a drink.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.791
There's just no way in hell
her character would ever do that.

18:22.875 --> 18:24.125
Who cares? It was funny.

18:24.208 --> 18:26.000
Uh-uh.
It was cockamamie.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.125
I'm sorry,
no one uses that word anymore.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.083
[scoffs] Well, it's the only word I know

18:31.166 --> 18:34.083
that accurately describes
every romantic comedy in history.

18:34.166 --> 18:37.250
There's always some fake reason
the stars can't be together

18:37.333 --> 18:39.833
when you know they're gonna be together
from the poster.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.041
It's like, "Oh, boo-hoo.

18:42.125 --> 18:43.750
I'm so heartbroken.

18:43.833 --> 18:45.541
Even though you're perfect for me,

18:45.625 --> 18:47.791
-I'm taking a break from dating."
-[giggles]

18:47.875 --> 18:49.458
I mean, no one is ever...

18:50.541 --> 18:51.916
taking a break from dating!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.083
And let me tell you,

18:53.166 --> 18:54.875
if Ryan Gosling waltzed in here,

18:54.958 --> 18:58.166
picked me up, floated me around
to the theme of Dirty Dancing,

18:58.250 --> 18:59.416
I'm not gonna be like,

18:59.500 --> 19:03.000
"Oh, hey, Ryan, buddy, bad timing.
I'm taking a break from dating."

19:03.083 --> 19:05.916
[scoffs] I am jumping on that train.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.625
The Ryan Gosling train.

19:07.708 --> 19:09.500
I'd jump on the Ryan Gosling train.

19:10.791 --> 19:14.041
So, who was this dickhead
that ruined romantic comedies for you?

19:14.541 --> 19:17.583
-[chuckles] I'd rather not go there.
-We're already here.

19:17.666 --> 19:18.541
[laughs]

19:18.625 --> 19:20.666
What's his name? Bill?

19:21.333 --> 19:22.166
Fred?

19:22.833 --> 19:23.708
Carlos?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.000
-Juan?
-What?

19:26.083 --> 19:27.791
Bob? What?

19:29.250 --> 19:30.166
Luc.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.083
Luc?

19:32.166 --> 19:33.291
Luc.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.125
Oh, he sounds like a wanker.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.083
No.

19:36.541 --> 19:38.083
He was handsome,

19:38.166 --> 19:39.416
smart,

19:39.791 --> 19:41.375
-French.
-[groans]

19:41.458 --> 19:44.500
He wore these sexy,
little John Lennon glasses.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.750
-Ugh...
-Did triathlons.

19:47.625 --> 19:49.000
Man, he had stamina.

30:28.458 --> 30:30.833
Golf is the least athletic sport
on the planet.

30:30.916 --> 30:34.333
I'll have you know that golf requires
more precise muscle control

30:34.416 --> 30:36.125
and hand-eye coordination

30:36.208 --> 30:38.500
than football and basketball combined.

30:38.958 --> 30:39.875
Maybe.

30:39.958 --> 30:43.291

to take him up and down the court.

Well, if I wasn't such a pussy,

you'd be stuck in a candy store

30:56.291 --> 30:59.458

and his smoking hot new girlfriend.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.541

It sucks running into your boyfriend

32:02.875 --> 32:05.458
on Valentine's Day, in a candy store,
wearing pajamas.

32:05.541 --> 32:07.958
Ex-boyfriend, and these are not pajamas.

32:08.041 --> 32:09.458
They're lounge pants.

the worst Valentine's Day of my life.

Why didn't you just call me?

32:16.666 --> 32:18.041
I don't know.

32:18.125 --> 32:20.166
I guess I was just embarrassed to admit

32:20.250 --> 32:22.375
that nothing had changed since New Year's.

32:22.458 --> 32:24.625
Isn't that the point
of this holidate thing

32:24.708 --> 32:28.125
that we get to avoid
this stupid pressure and all the judgment?

32:28.208 --> 32:30.250
Look, whatever.
At least the biggies are behind us.

32:30.666 --> 32:33.041
I mean, Christmas, New Year's,
Valentine's Day.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.666
Yeah, but I'm telling you,
the small ones are just as risky.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.166
I once spent an Earth Day

32:37.250 --> 32:39.666
chained to a tree
with a chick from Greenpeace.

No, I'm serious.
Friends with benefits never works.

32:57.416 --> 32:59.875
Yeah, but that's only because

-Well, yeah.

33:03.291 --> 33:04.416
It's not your fault.

Women are hardwired
to attach and procreate.

33:07.666 --> 33:09.833
And men are hardwired to panic and flee.

Okay, gang, a little hustle, please.

49:01.833 --> 49:03.541
We gotta find that finger.

49:03.625 --> 49:04.541
[York] Got it! Got it!

49:04.625 --> 49:05.625
-[Liz] Yeah!
-[Sam] Yeah!

49:05.708 --> 49:07.125
-Yes!
-[all cheering]

49:07.208 --> 49:08.500
-[York] Booyah! Good eye!

49:09.708 --> 49:10.750
[Liz] Ew!

49:11.000 --> 49:12.125
Are you sure that's mine?

49:12.208 --> 49:14.250
He's in shock. Get him to the hospital.

49:14.333 --> 49:16.583
-I'll take him.
-No! You're drunk. I'll take him.

49:16.666 --> 49:18.166
Hit a Burger King on the way.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.958
-Are you stoned?
-No. Why, are you?

49:20.041 --> 49:21.916
Okay. Peter's sober. You can drive him.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.333
-We'll watch the kids.
-[Uncle Sam] Cool.

49:24.416 --> 49:26.000
-You kids can tread water?
-[kids] Yeah!

49:26.083 --> 49:26.916
[Peter] Uh...

49:27.000 --> 49:29.375
Nope. No way I'm leaving my children
with these degenerates.

49:29.458 --> 49:30.750
Good call. Oh, God!

49:30.833 --> 49:32.708
-Okay. All right.
-Please, no. Not me.

49:32.791 --> 49:35.541
I'm not good with blood. You know this.
Or cars. Or blood.

49:35.625 --> 49:36.791
Yes. Yes.

49:36.875 --> 49:38.416
-No!
-You got this.

49:38.500 --> 49:40.375
Go, go, go, go! Breathe! Breathe!

49:41.583 --> 49:43.041
You're gonna be okay, buddy.

49:44.291 --> 49:46.666
It's my fuck-you finger!
[panting]

49:46.750 --> 49:49.000
-I can't lose my fuck-you finger.
-Sloane, good luck.

49:49.083 --> 49:51.666
-His fuck-you finger is in your hands.
-Don't say that!

49:53.083 --> 49:54.958
-[car accelerates]
-[Jackson] Oh!

49:55.041 --> 49:56.166
-[tires screech]
-[loud slam]

49:56.250 --> 49:59.833
Oh! Jesus H. Christ!
[whimpering]

49:59.916 --> 50:01.958
I'm sorry. Does it hurt really bad?

50:02.041 --> 50:03.833
-No, it's like a paper cut.
-Really?

50:03.916 --> 50:05.333
[screams] No, not really!

50:05.416 --> 50:06.583
Don't yell at me!

50:06.666 --> 50:09.708
I'm a nervous driver,
technically unlicensed.

50:09.791 --> 50:12.041
-You don't have a license?
-I mean, I had one.

50:12.125 --> 50:14.166
It just expired a while back.

50:14.250 --> 50:17.125
Jesus Christ!
My finger is in a fucking Ziploc bag!

50:17.208 --> 50:20.333
I know, and it's really freaking me out.
Can you put it in the glove box?

50:20.416 --> 50:22.416
We wouldn't want you to be freaked out,
would we?

50:22.500 --> 50:23.958
[tires screeching]

50:24.041 --> 50:26.583
-Your sister smokes weed?
-There's a lighter in my purse.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.125
I-- I don't do drugs.

50:28.208 --> 50:30.166
And you call yourself
a professional athlete?

50:30.250 --> 50:32.083
-[Jackson] Watch out!
-[Sloane screams] Oh, God!

50:32.166 --> 50:34.166
[Jackson] Slow down! Right, right, right!

50:34.708 --> 50:35.708
[Jackson] Shrubbery!

50:36.208 --> 50:38.000
Sloane, seriously!

50:38.083 --> 50:39.208
Car!

50:39.291 --> 50:41.166
-[both screaming]
-[car horn blaring]

50:42.458 --> 50:44.500
[Sloane]
Why couldn't they just call an Uber?

50:44.583 --> 50:45.500
[loud beep over PA]

50:45.583 --> 50:48.166
[woman on PA] Dr. Lambert to the OR, stat.

50:49.041 --> 50:50.583
[reggae music playing]

50:51.083 --> 50:53.291
[both laughing and coughing]

50:54.041 --> 50:55.208
[Sloane] Oh, my God.

50:57.041 --> 50:58.625
-Just relax.
-[coughs]

50:58.708 --> 51:00.958
I've got it all under control.

51:01.458 --> 51:03.625
You don't have to lift a finger.

51:03.708 --> 51:05.083
[both laughing]

51:05.166 --> 51:06.416
[woman] Seriously?

51:11.833 --> 51:13.416
I'm too tired to report you.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
-Thanks, mate.
-I'm sorry.

51:18.333 --> 51:20.916
Honestly, I know you from somewhere.

51:22.583 --> 51:23.458
I just--

51:23.833 --> 51:27.000
[sighs] I just can't put my finger on it.

51:27.083 --> 51:29.208
[both laughing]

51:31.250 --> 51:33.791
The doctor will be with you shortly.
He's reattaching a toe.

51:33.875 --> 51:34.750
Toe?

51:35.250 --> 51:36.208
Hold on a second.

51:36.291 --> 51:38.916
A finger must take priority over a toe.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.333
Sorry.

51:40.416 --> 51:43.250
If only you'd been a jackass
a little earlier in the day.

51:46.333 --> 51:47.166
Wow.

51:47.791 --> 51:49.416
You've really got her

51:49.500 --> 51:51.750
wrapped around your finger.

51:51.833 --> 51:53.083
[both laughing]

51:55.291 --> 51:56.833
[doctor] All right.

51:57.291 --> 51:58.125
Faarooq?

51:59.708 --> 52:00.541
Sloane.

52:00.625 --> 52:01.958
Are you hurt?

52:02.041 --> 52:03.500
-Are you okay?
-Hi.

52:03.583 --> 52:04.416
Hey.

52:05.125 --> 52:08.125
No, I'm fine. I didn't know you worked
all the way out here.

52:08.208 --> 52:10.833
I don't, normally.
They called me to reattach a pinkie toe.

52:10.916 --> 52:11.791
[chuckles]

52:12.041 --> 52:13.416
That's so amazing.

52:14.041 --> 52:16.041
It's a crucial phalange.

52:16.125 --> 52:17.791
Stop.
[laughing]

52:18.625 --> 52:19.458
[laughs]

52:19.541 --> 52:21.833
Wow, you're doing such amazing work.

52:21.916 --> 52:23.250
It's like wow.

52:23.333 --> 52:25.416
[both laugh]

52:25.500 --> 52:26.833
I'm just doing my part.

52:26.916 --> 52:27.916
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

52:28.541 --> 52:29.375
Aw...

52:30.416 --> 52:33.791
[Faarooq] I was a little disappointed
I didn't hear back from you.

52:33.875 --> 52:37.625
And I'm disappointed that
I don't get to see my favorite bunny suit.

52:37.708 --> 52:39.666
Ah! Yes, Jackson.

52:39.750 --> 52:40.750
From Easter.

52:41.333 --> 52:43.083
Sparkler got away from you, did it?

52:43.166 --> 52:45.333
Uh, It was an M-80, actually.

52:46.166 --> 52:47.333
Ah... ooh!

52:47.875 --> 52:48.958
That's gonna hurt.

52:49.708 --> 52:50.833
Skin's a little crispy...

52:51.541 --> 52:52.375
[retching]

52:52.458 --> 52:55.083
but it looks like the bone didn't shatter.

52:55.166 --> 52:56.250
Oh, yes.

52:56.333 --> 52:57.666
All right. Hang tight.

52:58.166 --> 52:59.875
We'll get you prepped for surgery, okay?

52:59.958 --> 53:03.000
-[gasps] You can fix it! He can fix it!
-Well... we'll see.

53:03.666 --> 53:04.625
Fingers crossed.

53:06.791 --> 53:08.000
Tough crowd.

53:10.000 --> 53:10.875
[door opens]

53:10.958 --> 53:12.166
[Sloane] All right.

53:12.250 --> 53:13.375
Here we go.

53:13.458 --> 53:14.291
You good?

53:14.375 --> 53:16.875
Oh, okay. Is this a shoeless apartment?
[chuckles]

53:17.208 --> 53:18.333
All right.

53:18.416 --> 53:20.250
I got your prescriptions right here.

53:20.333 --> 53:21.333
Thank you.

53:21.916 --> 53:24.666
The deli down the block
will be delivering your soup.

53:24.750 --> 53:25.958
Mm-hmm.

53:26.500 --> 53:27.458
And...

53:28.583 --> 53:30.458
-I called your mother.
-Really? What--

53:30.875 --> 53:31.916
What did she say?

53:32.000 --> 53:34.166
She didn't answer.
I just left a message.

53:34.625 --> 53:35.541
Oh, yeah.

53:35.625 --> 53:38.750
Told her you had a little accident
and should probably give you a call.

53:39.291 --> 53:40.250
Thanks.

53:40.958 --> 53:41.791
Uh...

53:42.666 --> 53:45.666
I'm really sorry that I ruined
your Fourth of July.

53:45.750 --> 53:46.583
[laughs]

53:47.041 --> 53:48.500
Holidate rule number three,

53:48.708 --> 53:50.375
"Leave no holidate behind."

53:51.083 --> 53:52.791
Or their appendages.

53:52.875 --> 53:54.583
[both giggle]

54:01.791 --> 54:03.208
[sighs]

54:07.083 --> 54:09.416
You should--
you should probably get some rest.

54:09.500 --> 54:11.625
Yeah. Yeah, I should.

54:13.583 --> 54:14.708
Unless...

54:15.375 --> 54:16.791
you need anything else?

54:19.958 --> 54:21.458
No, I think I'm good.

54:23.333 --> 54:24.708
Look, I-- I think I'm fine.

54:27.750 --> 54:29.041
I'm really tired.

54:30.000 --> 54:30.958
Okay.

54:31.666 --> 54:33.958
I guess I'll just go then.

54:34.041 --> 54:35.000
[both chuckle]

54:35.125 --> 54:36.541
Okay. Yeah, sure.

54:41.833 --> 54:43.166
-See you later.
-[chuckles]

55:02.833 --> 55:03.875
[door closes]

55:10.291 --> 55:11.500
[golf club hits]

55:13.666 --> 55:14.791
Our hands touched.

55:16.458 --> 55:17.458
Holy shit.

55:19.750 --> 55:20.791
You use protection?

55:20.875 --> 55:23.333
[whispers] I'm telling you,
there was a vibe.

55:23.416 --> 55:24.541
Vibes are hot.

55:25.291 --> 55:27.166
God, I miss vibes.

55:27.250 --> 55:28.666
Yeah, but now it's weird.

55:28.750 --> 55:32.583
Weirder than not knowing whether or not
his penis was actually inside of you?

55:32.666 --> 55:36.083
Yes, actually,
because vibes could be real feelings.

55:36.166 --> 55:38.333
I'm trying to tell you
there was a serious shift.

55:38.416 --> 55:40.583
It is... not platonic anymore.

55:40.666 --> 55:43.083
You're in trouble. You gotta get out.

55:43.166 --> 55:45.375
I can't.
It's her brother's wedding on Labor Day.

55:45.458 --> 55:47.333
I'm so confused.

55:47.666 --> 55:50.500
You like him. He likes you.
These are not real problems.

55:50.583 --> 55:51.625
Yes, they are.

55:51.708 --> 55:55.375
I can't "like him" like him until
I know for sure he "likes me" likes me.

55:55.458 --> 55:58.708
You cannot go to a wedding with a girl
who has actual feelings for you.

55:58.791 --> 56:00.375
They start to get ideas and shit.

56:00.458 --> 56:03.041
Listen to me, brother, as a black man,
I'm speaking to this.

56:03.125 --> 56:05.708
Don't do it. No. No.

56:05.791 --> 56:07.750
Labor Day is technically a holiday.

56:07.833 --> 56:09.291
We have the holidate deal.

56:09.375 --> 56:10.791
A wedding trumps a holiday.

56:10.875 --> 56:12.125
You understand that, right?

56:12.791 --> 56:15.958
Men loathe weddings,
even if it's a holiday, right?

56:16.041 --> 56:18.416
So, if he's not trying to get out of it,

56:18.791 --> 56:19.958
there's your answer.

56:20.833 --> 56:22.541
I'm gonna ask him about the wedding.

56:22.625 --> 56:25.708
Tell her to go with someone else.
Someone who has actual potential.

56:26.125 --> 56:27.583
Like you're doing her a favor.

56:28.250 --> 56:30.291
Well, then who do I bring?

56:31.750 --> 56:34.250
Someone who doesn't
give a shit about weddings.

56:34.708 --> 56:36.958
-I'm booked.
-[golf club hits]

56:37.041 --> 56:39.041
[cellphone vibrating]

56:41.083 --> 56:43.250
It's not a holiday.
Why are you calling me?

56:43.333 --> 56:45.333
It's an emergency. If you don't help me,

56:45.416 --> 56:48.000
York and Liz are gonna get
a gift card for their wedding present.

56:48.333 --> 56:49.333
What about this?

56:52.166 --> 56:54.000
Hideous and wrong.

56:54.083 --> 56:56.625
The Pottery Barn pillow sham
are still available--

56:56.708 --> 56:58.791
Guys don't get other guys shams.

56:59.083 --> 57:00.666
It's mostly for Liz.

57:01.291 --> 57:02.458
I suppose you're right.

57:02.958 --> 57:05.708
I-- look, you know, I was thinking, and,

57:05.791 --> 57:08.625
honestly, I was not expecting
to be invited.

57:09.291 --> 57:12.333
So, I don't really know the protocol here.

57:12.416 --> 57:14.208
You know, it's a wedding, but--

57:14.291 --> 57:15.625
But also a holiday.

57:15.708 --> 57:18.041
Yeah, I... had the same thought.

57:18.125 --> 57:19.125
-[sighs]
-Oh!

57:19.541 --> 57:20.375
You did?

57:20.958 --> 57:21.833
That's great.

57:21.916 --> 57:22.875
It is?

57:23.333 --> 57:24.375
Oh, well.

57:24.458 --> 57:25.750
[chuckles] I'm so relieved.

57:25.833 --> 57:27.000
Me too. [chuckles]

57:27.208 --> 57:29.208
-So, we'll just--
-So, we'll bring dates.

57:30.583 --> 57:31.666
Uh, dates?

57:32.375 --> 57:34.000
Well... yeah.

57:34.458 --> 57:35.458
Dates, right?

57:36.750 --> 57:38.458
Yeah. Dates.
[chuckles]

57:39.291 --> 57:40.958
-Other... people.
-Perfect.

57:46.625 --> 57:48.166
[upbeat music playing]

57:49.916 --> 57:51.666
[York]
Attention! Attention! Gather around.

57:51.750 --> 57:53.250
I got something I need to say.

57:53.500 --> 57:54.416
All right?

57:54.500 --> 57:57.500
First off, Liz's parents,
or should I say, "Mom and Dad"?

57:57.583 --> 57:59.791
Thank you for this
freaking awesome wedding.

57:59.875 --> 58:01.041
[guests cheering]

58:01.125 --> 58:03.458
Most importantly, to my beautiful bride,

58:04.000 --> 58:05.166
and lady fate.

58:05.791 --> 58:09.291
If I hadn't taken the wrong L train
that day, we never would've met.

58:10.333 --> 58:11.833
But we met at a party.

58:11.916 --> 58:13.083
I love you, baby!

58:13.166 --> 58:15.041
-Cheers!
-[guests] Cheers!

58:16.666 --> 58:17.791
To us.

58:18.208 --> 58:19.375
We did it.

58:19.458 --> 58:20.958
[Elaine laughs]

58:24.291 --> 58:26.250
I cannot believe he brought her
to the wedding.

58:26.333 --> 58:28.166
I mean, they hardly know each other.

58:28.875 --> 58:30.500
I mean, admit it. It's weird.

58:30.583 --> 58:32.208
-You have to admit it.
-I don't--

58:32.291 --> 58:35.125
But they're both single and sexy.
It's not that weird.

58:35.208 --> 58:37.458
She's family, and he's a friend.

58:38.791 --> 58:39.916
[fake laughing]

1:07:18.583 --> 1:07:21.291
and my ex-boyfriend has impregnated
a teenage girl.

1:07:21.375 --> 1:07:23.208
Sweetie, here have another antacid.

1:07:23.291 --> 1:07:24.791
[Jackson] Are you all right?

1:07:25.083 --> 1:07:25.916
No.

1:07:26.708 --> 1:07:27.958
No! Okay?

1:07:28.041 --> 1:07:31.291
This is what I get for letting you
trap me in this torture device!

1:07:32.958 --> 1:07:35.458
-Do you want me to take you home?
-Yeah.

1:07:36.250 --> 1:07:38.250
-Oh.
-It's all right. I can take her.

1:07:38.333 --> 1:07:41.041
No. I can. I mean, it's just that--

1:07:41.125 --> 1:07:43.083
-If you're volunteering--
-[Jackson] It's fine.

1:07:43.166 --> 1:07:46.083
-[Sloane] You don't have to do this.
-Holidate rule number three:

1:07:46.166 --> 1:07:48.166
Leave no holidate behind. Come on.

1:07:53.875 --> 1:07:55.208
[tires screeching]

1:07:56.833 --> 1:07:57.833
[Jackson] Okay.

1:07:58.666 --> 1:08:02.125
[Jackson] All right. Come on, dear.
Let's go. Let's go.

1:08:02.208 --> 1:08:05.208
[Sloane grunts] You know what,
just leave me. Ouch!

1:08:05.333 --> 1:08:08.125
-Yeah, okay, no. We're gonna go. Ready?
-Leave me, please.

1:08:08.208 --> 1:08:10.208
-One, two, three!
-No, no, no! No!

1:08:10.291 --> 1:08:11.250
[Jackson grunts]

1:08:11.333 --> 1:08:12.333
Okay.

1:08:12.416 --> 1:08:13.500
Come on.

1:08:13.583 --> 1:08:14.750
We're almost there.

1:08:15.833 --> 1:08:17.500
-[Jackson grunts]
-[Sloane moans]

1:08:17.583 --> 1:08:18.583
Oh, my God.

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:21.416
-It's Halloween!
-Yeah, hence the costumes.

1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:24.750
February, March, April, May, June,
July, August, September, October.

1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:26.041
They did it

1:08:26.125 --> 1:08:27.916
on Valentine's Day.

1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:30.375
Everyone did it on Valentine's Day.

1:08:30.458 --> 1:08:33.125
-I didn't do it on Valentine's Day!
-[elevator dings]

1:08:33.208 --> 1:08:34.208
Neither did I!

1:08:34.291 --> 1:08:37.625
They hardly even know each other,
and they’re already procreating.

1:08:37.708 --> 1:08:39.291
It's a mess. Let's go. Come on.

1:08:39.375 --> 1:08:41.708
Oh, my God. This is so embarrassing.

1:08:41.791 --> 1:08:44.708
-Trust me, I've seen much worse.
-How could this get worse?

1:08:44.791 --> 1:08:46.333
-Yeah.
-My tummy hurts.

1:08:46.416 --> 1:08:48.125
-Can I have one more pill?
-Yeah.

1:08:48.208 --> 1:08:50.208
[upbeat music playing]

1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:52.333
[Abby] Oh, shit!

1:08:53.333 --> 1:08:59.416
[stomach growling, gurgling]

1:09:01.041 --> 1:09:02.125
Untie me.

1:09:02.833 --> 1:09:04.791
-What?
-Just-- don't question!

1:09:04.875 --> 1:09:06.000
Just untie me!

1:09:06.083 --> 1:09:07.083
Come on.

1:09:08.041 --> 1:09:11.458
-The laces! Hurry!
-What the hell is all this?

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.458
I'm trying, okay? I'm trying!

1:09:13.541 --> 1:09:15.375
[stomach gurgling]

1:09:15.458 --> 1:09:16.291
Just rip it.

1:09:16.750 --> 1:09:17.750
Okay, just--

1:09:17.833 --> 1:09:20.166
You know what?Just rip it.

1:09:20.250 --> 1:09:22.875
Just rip my fucking pants off!

1:09:22.958 --> 1:09:23.958
[elevator dings]

1:09:25.458 --> 1:09:27.458
[stomach growls]

1:09:30.458 --> 1:09:31.500
[elevator dings]

1:09:31.583 --> 1:09:33.666
[Jackson] You're locked up like
Houdini in this!

1:09:33.750 --> 1:09:35.916
-[Sloane] This is your fault!
-[stomach gurgling loudly]

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.166
Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus!

1:09:38.250 --> 1:09:40.416
Please don't let this happen to me.

1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:41.458
Fuck!

1:09:42.833 --> 1:09:45.375
Don't let me be
the girl who shits her pants.

1:09:45.458 --> 1:09:48.125
[Jackson] Come on, almost there!
I'm almost there.

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.250
[Sloane] Get it off.
[stomach growls]

1:09:51.333 --> 1:09:53.291
-[Jackson] Shit. Come on.
-[Sloane] The door.

1:09:53.375 --> 1:09:55.583
-You got it. Come on. We got it.
-Shit!

1:09:55.666 --> 1:09:56.791
[Sloane grunts]

1:09:56.875 --> 1:09:59.083
-Come on. You're all right. Close!
-[Sloane] Let me go!

1:09:59.166 --> 1:10:01.291
-[Jackson] Wait, wait, wait!
-[Sloane] I can't! I can't!

1:10:01.375 --> 1:10:03.125
[stomach growling]

1:10:03.208 --> 1:10:04.625
Got it!

1:10:04.708 --> 1:10:06.458
[Sloane screaming] Oh, no!

1:10:06.541 --> 1:10:08.583
[Sloane moans and cries]

1:10:08.666 --> 1:10:09.916
Did you make it?

1:10:10.625 --> 1:10:12.250
[Sloane] Go away!

1:10:13.583 --> 1:10:14.500
Go away!

1:10:28.083 --> 1:10:29.125
Don't look at me.

1:10:29.208 --> 1:10:30.541
I'm not looking.

1:10:39.208 --> 1:10:40.083
[sighs]

1:10:59.333 --> 1:11:00.666
Peppermint tea.

1:11:01.250 --> 1:11:02.375
Helps with the nausea.

1:11:03.666 --> 1:11:05.125
I have peppermint tea?

1:11:05.833 --> 1:11:07.000
Uh, sort of.

1:11:07.083 --> 1:11:10.250
I mean, it's just crushed Altoids
in boiling water.

1:11:11.333 --> 1:11:12.166
Hmm.

1:11:13.666 --> 1:11:14.500
[sighs]

1:11:15.875 --> 1:11:16.791
So, I guess...

1:11:17.416 --> 1:11:20.208
I'll be an anecdote
you tell at parties now?

1:11:21.166 --> 1:11:22.416
The girl who...

1:11:24.125 --> 1:11:25.958
[sighs] The girl who...

1:11:27.541 --> 1:11:28.375
[whimpers]

1:11:28.875 --> 1:11:30.958
The girl who shit her pants on Halloween?

1:11:31.458 --> 1:11:32.916
Oh, God.

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:33.875
[moans]

1:11:34.750 --> 1:11:35.583
[whimpers]

1:11:37.083 --> 1:11:38.000
You know,

1:11:38.583 --> 1:11:39.458
technically...

1:11:40.625 --> 1:11:43.333
we've all been shitting our pants
since we were born.

1:11:45.458 --> 1:11:46.333
[chuckles]

1:11:49.458 --> 1:11:51.666
Don't worry, okay?
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

1:11:52.708 --> 1:11:53.666
I promise.

1:12:00.958 --> 1:12:01.791
Thank you.

1:12:18.708 --> 1:12:19.750
[sniffs]

1:12:23.500 --> 1:12:24.458
[sighs]

1:12:26.291 --> 1:12:28.291
[birds chirping]

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000
[dog barking in distance]

1:12:39.625 --> 1:12:41.625
[sirens wailing in distance]

1:12:47.958 --> 1:12:49.208
[both chuckle]

1:12:51.208 --> 1:12:52.250
[both sigh]

1:12:54.333 --> 1:12:55.208
[Sloane chuckles]

1:12:56.500 --> 1:12:58.083
[Jackson exhales]

1:13:11.416 --> 1:13:14.625
[Sloane] I hate, in movies,
when people kiss in the morning.

1:13:15.833 --> 1:13:17.375
I think it's gross.

1:13:17.458 --> 1:13:18.416
[both chuckle]

1:14:47.625 --> 1:14:48.458
[Jackson] Wow.

1:14:49.875 --> 1:14:50.708
[Sloane] Yeah.

1:14:53.125 --> 1:14:54.625
So, I guess we should....

1:14:56.041 --> 1:14:58.041
[sighs] You can go if you want.

1:14:58.708 --> 1:14:59.541
[pants]

1:15:00.375 --> 1:15:01.416
You want me to leave?

1:15:02.708 --> 1:15:03.541
[chuckles]

1:15:05.916 --> 1:15:08.916
I-- I mean, if-- if-- if you want. I--

1:15:09.666 --> 1:15:10.500
Don't feel

1:15:11.250 --> 1:15:12.625
obligated to stay.

1:15:13.708 --> 1:15:14.791
Obligated?

1:15:16.750 --> 1:15:18.958
Halloween's over, right?

1:15:21.458 --> 1:15:22.291
Right.

1:15:23.166 --> 1:15:24.375
Halloween's over.

1:15:28.541 --> 1:15:30.333
[doorbell dings repeatedly]

1:15:30.416 --> 1:15:31.750
[knocking on door repeatedly]

1:15:31.833 --> 1:15:34.000
[doorbell dings repeatedly]

1:15:35.583 --> 1:15:37.583
[knocking continues]

1:15:39.041 --> 1:15:40.083
[knocking continues]

1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.708
[doorbell dings repeatedly]

1:15:42.791 --> 1:15:44.833
[knocking rapidly]

1:15:44.916 --> 1:15:46.666
[Sloane] All right, coming!

1:15:47.250 --> 1:15:49.291
-[Sloane gasps]
-[Abby breathing heavily]

1:15:49.375 --> 1:15:50.916
I kissed the Black Panther.

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.666
-What?
-The Black Panther!

1:15:53.208 --> 1:15:54.291
I kissed him!

1:15:54.375 --> 1:15:56.000
We were standing in line,

1:15:56.375 --> 1:15:59.500
you know, waiting for the bathroom,
and then it suddenly happened.

1:15:59.583 --> 1:16:00.458
We kissed.

1:16:00.541 --> 1:16:02.000
Ew! With tongue?

1:16:02.083 --> 1:16:02.958
[Abby gags]

1:16:03.041 --> 1:16:06.458
Oh, my God. I'm a horrible person.
I'm going to hell a thousand times.

1:16:06.541 --> 1:16:10.208
-You're not a horrible person--
-Oh, my God! Yes, I am! Yes, I am!

1:16:10.291 --> 1:16:12.916
I am a horrible wife and mother,

1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.666
and I am married to a freaking saint.

1:16:15.750 --> 1:16:18.291
Peter is, like,
the best man in the whole world,

1:16:18.375 --> 1:16:20.000
and this is how I treat him?

1:16:20.625 --> 1:16:22.083
I hate myself.

1:16:22.416 --> 1:16:24.500
-No--
-I can't fucking believe

1:16:24.583 --> 1:16:29.041
that I kissed the Black Panther!
[screaming]

1:16:29.125 --> 1:16:30.250
[sobbing]

1:16:30.333 --> 1:16:31.916
[grunts and screams]

1:16:32.541 --> 1:16:33.541
Morning, Abby.

1:16:33.625 --> 1:16:34.625
[sobbing stops abruptly]

1:16:39.791 --> 1:16:40.708
Oh, hi.

1:16:41.208 --> 1:16:42.250
Hey, um...

1:16:43.208 --> 1:16:45.958
I was just telling Sloane
about this dream I had last night.

1:16:46.041 --> 1:16:47.041
[Jackson] Cool.

1:16:48.583 --> 1:16:49.875
Well, I was just leaving.

1:16:52.250 --> 1:16:53.083
Wait.

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:57.625
You guys had sex.

1:16:57.708 --> 1:16:58.833
[scoffs]

1:16:58.916 --> 1:17:00.000
No, we didn't.

1:17:00.416 --> 1:17:01.333
We didn't?

1:17:04.708 --> 1:17:06.000
Oh, I should go. Okay.

1:17:06.083 --> 1:17:07.500
No, no, no! You should stay.

1:17:07.583 --> 1:17:09.791
You seem-- you seem really upset

1:17:09.875 --> 1:17:11.375
about your dream.

1:17:12.375 --> 1:17:14.291
Yeah. You stay. I'll go.

1:17:19.666 --> 1:17:20.583
Okay?

1:17:25.875 --> 1:17:26.708
Okay.

1:17:28.333 --> 1:17:29.208
Bye.

1:17:30.250 --> 1:17:32.333
Okay, bye! See you at Thanksgiving!

1:17:36.333 --> 1:17:37.583
What the hell was that?

1:17:38.666 --> 1:17:39.958
What?

1:17:40.375 --> 1:17:41.500
Nothing.

1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:43.041
I'm gonna make coffee.

1:17:43.125 --> 1:17:45.000
She practically shoved me out the door.

1:17:45.833 --> 1:17:47.875
-She didn't even want to snuggle?
-Uh-uh.

1:17:47.958 --> 1:17:49.583
-Cuddle?
-No.

1:17:49.666 --> 1:17:50.791
Go to brunch?

1:17:52.250 --> 1:17:53.708
I didn't get a cup of coffee.

1:17:54.125 --> 1:17:56.208
[sighs] Damn, man. That hurts.

1:17:56.291 --> 1:17:57.125
Hmm.

1:17:57.458 --> 1:17:59.041
You know, I've never been asked to leave.

1:17:59.125 --> 1:18:00.541
Yeah, bro. I feel you, okay?

1:18:00.666 --> 1:18:03.750
Me and Abby had a real connection,
and she hasn't even called.

1:18:05.125 --> 1:18:07.416
Do you know what the last thing
she said to me was?

1:18:07.875 --> 1:18:09.416
"See you at Thanksgiving."

1:18:09.958 --> 1:18:12.750
Like, it was completely
meaningless to her.

1:18:12.833 --> 1:18:14.541
That is cold, man.

1:18:15.541 --> 1:18:17.625
But you still got your holidate, right?

1:18:18.166 --> 1:18:21.833
-I don't think I can do it anymore.
-This is what I'm thinking, okay?

1:18:22.416 --> 1:18:25.250
You go to Thanksgiving,
and act like nothing has changed.

1:18:25.333 --> 1:18:26.166
Okay.

1:18:26.250 --> 1:18:28.333
If it makes you feel better,
I'll go with you.

1:18:29.166 --> 1:18:30.500
-Why?
-[chuckles] "Why?"

1:18:31.583 --> 1:18:33.750
Me and Abby made a connection, remember?

1:18:35.083 --> 1:18:36.208
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:18:36.666 --> 1:18:38.125
You made a connection

1:18:38.208 --> 1:18:40.333
-with a married mother of four?
-[groans]

1:18:40.833 --> 1:18:43.208
Oh, it sounded bad
when  you said it like that.

1:18:44.083 --> 1:18:46.416
-[sighs] But if she asks about me--
-She won't.

1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:47.625
Yeah. Okay.

1:18:48.041 --> 1:18:49.750
-But if she does--
-She will not.

1:18:49.833 --> 1:18:50.958
Whoa.

1:18:51.041 --> 1:18:51.958
Okay.

1:18:52.458 --> 1:18:54.375
-Let it go.
-I'm trying to let it go.

1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.625
You don't wanna close one door
'cause it'll open another.

1:18:57.708 --> 1:19:00.833
[Jackson] Yes, you do.
Shut it tight. Lock it.

1:19:00.916 --> 1:19:02.333
-If she does--
-She will not.

1:19:02.416 --> 1:19:03.333
I'm here.

1:19:04.750 --> 1:19:06.666
[Susan] Oh, hello!

1:19:06.750 --> 1:19:09.375
Happy Thanksgiving.

1:19:09.458 --> 1:19:11.333
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-Kisses.

1:19:11.583 --> 1:19:13.208
Mwah! Mwah!

1:19:13.333 --> 1:19:15.500
Now, meet my new friend, Warren.

1:19:15.916 --> 1:19:17.583
-Wally.
-That's what I said.

1:19:17.666 --> 1:19:19.083
[chuckles] Hi, I'm Abby.

1:19:19.166 --> 1:19:20.500
-Wally. Yeah.
-Sloane.

1:19:20.583 --> 1:19:21.625
Sloane, pleasure--

1:19:22.416 --> 1:19:26.750
Ooh! Howdy-ho! Something smells great
coming from this kitchen.

1:19:26.833 --> 1:19:28.416
May I take a sample?

1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:29.375
No.

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:30.875
Maybe later.

1:19:31.458 --> 1:19:33.416
I told you, my sister burns everything.

1:19:33.500 --> 1:19:35.541
It's not burnt. It's well-done.

1:19:36.583 --> 1:19:38.166
That's what basting is for.

1:19:38.541 --> 1:19:39.708
It's okay with me.

1:19:39.791 --> 1:19:41.791
Kind of like my meat a little crispy.

1:19:47.875 --> 1:19:49.208
You didn't invite Faarooq?

1:19:49.291 --> 1:19:50.791
Oh, that? Oh, no.

1:19:51.750 --> 1:19:53.083
You know me.

1:19:53.166 --> 1:19:54.833
One holidate per customer.

1:19:54.916 --> 1:19:57.125
But you guys seemed so happy together.

1:19:57.208 --> 1:20:00.083
Short and sweet, honey.
Everything ends eventually.

1:20:00.750 --> 1:20:03.083
So, why sit around
waiting for it to happen?

1:20:08.708 --> 1:20:12.083
Liz, York. Abby, Peter, me,

1:20:12.166 --> 1:20:14.625
Susan, Susan's latest.

1:20:14.708 --> 1:20:16.375
Me and Jackson.

1:20:16.458 --> 1:20:18.333
Are you sure he's coming?

1:20:18.416 --> 1:20:20.083
I don't want to put the leaf in.

1:20:20.166 --> 1:20:21.000
Yes.

1:20:21.083 --> 1:20:21.916
He's coming.

1:20:22.333 --> 1:20:23.875
And he's coming alone, right?

1:20:24.291 --> 1:20:25.333
Okay, all right.

1:20:25.583 --> 1:20:27.875
-Just put the leaf in.
-It's in the basement.

1:20:27.958 --> 1:20:30.208
-[Sloane] Mom.
-We can use the piano bench.

1:20:30.291 --> 1:20:32.208
Just put the goddamn leaf in!

1:20:32.625 --> 1:20:33.666
[fire alarm beeping]

1:20:34.083 --> 1:20:35.208
[Liz] Is everything okay?

1:20:35.291 --> 1:20:37.291
[Elaine] Oh! Oh!

1:20:37.750 --> 1:20:40.208
-[Liz] Is dinner burning?
-[Elaine coughing]

1:20:40.291 --> 1:20:41.500
I'll call 911.

1:20:41.583 --> 1:20:43.208
No. No. It's okay, honey.

1:20:43.291 --> 1:20:45.333
Nana just burnt the turkey and stuffing

1:20:45.416 --> 1:20:47.291
and hopefully a pie.

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.541
-Yams. Not sweet potatoes.
-Yeah, I got it.

1:20:51.625 --> 1:20:52.791
And cranberry sauce.

1:20:52.875 --> 1:20:54.250
Not that hoity-toity crap

1:20:54.333 --> 1:20:56.333
-claiming to be whole cranberries.
-Yes.

1:20:56.416 --> 1:20:57.333
And a pie!

1:21:02.625 --> 1:21:03.500
Hi.

1:21:03.583 --> 1:21:04.416
Hey.

1:21:05.166 --> 1:21:06.083
Hello.

1:21:07.750 --> 1:21:08.791
[Elaine] Oh!

1:21:08.875 --> 1:21:10.375
We're covered for dessert,

1:21:10.458 --> 1:21:12.750
but maybe the neighbors can use it.

1:21:15.625 --> 1:21:17.750
I have to go to the store. So, you can...

1:21:19.041 --> 1:21:19.916
I'll drive.

1:21:20.333 --> 1:21:21.375
[birds chirping]

1:21:21.833 --> 1:21:22.791
Okay.

1:21:26.916 --> 1:21:28.916
[pumping air]

1:21:37.291 --> 1:21:38.208
So...

1:21:39.041 --> 1:21:39.958
how have you been?

1:21:40.750 --> 1:21:41.666
Good.

1:21:42.125 --> 1:21:42.958
Busy.

1:21:43.625 --> 1:21:44.500
You?

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:45.833
Good.

1:21:46.083 --> 1:21:47.000
Busy.

1:21:48.625 --> 1:21:50.791
-Chip?
-You know I don't eat that shit.

1:21:50.875 --> 1:21:52.625
It's not shit. It's organic.

1:21:53.041 --> 1:21:55.750
Are we gonna pretend
like what happened didn't happen?

1:21:55.833 --> 1:21:56.875
Works for me.

1:21:59.875 --> 1:22:02.791
Okay, but for the record, I'm not the one
that wanted to leave that morning.

1:22:02.875 --> 1:22:04.791
Oh, I didn't hear you asking to stay.

1:22:04.875 --> 1:22:06.833
Well, you didn't give me a chance.

1:22:06.916 --> 1:22:08.041
Oh, please.

1:22:08.125 --> 1:22:10.833
You didn't want to have sex with me
in the first place.

1:22:11.291 --> 1:22:12.375
[girl gasps]

1:22:13.166 --> 1:22:16.041
[woman] Hmm. Come on. Let's go.

1:22:16.958 --> 1:22:19.166
You're not even that attracted to me,
right?

1:22:19.666 --> 1:22:21.125
Why can't you let that go?

1:22:22.083 --> 1:22:24.000
Because when a guy basically opens

1:22:24.083 --> 1:22:26.500
with the fact
he doesn't find a girl attractive,

1:22:26.583 --> 1:22:29.041
it kinda sets the tone
for the rest of the relationship.

1:22:31.125 --> 1:22:33.833
I was some random bloke at the mall.

1:22:33.916 --> 1:22:36.250
Honestly, what do you think
would have happened

1:22:36.333 --> 1:22:38.916
if I'd said,
"Hey, I think you're incredibly beautiful!

1:22:40.625 --> 1:22:42.083
With these lips that...

1:22:43.833 --> 1:22:45.208
beg to be kissed.

1:22:47.916 --> 1:22:48.916
These eyes that are--

1:22:50.916 --> 1:22:53.541
Honestly, I don't know what they are.
They make me forget my name.

1:22:57.916 --> 1:23:00.000
There's just no way
you would've gone out with me.

1:23:00.500 --> 1:23:02.375
Especially, not on New Year's Eve.

1:23:05.500 --> 1:23:06.500
So...

1:23:09.291 --> 1:23:10.625
does that change anything?

1:23:14.666 --> 1:23:15.625
No.

1:23:16.125 --> 1:23:17.208
Nothing has changed.

1:23:18.083 --> 1:23:19.833
In fact, you can relax

1:23:19.916 --> 1:23:23.625
and continue to bang all the cocktail
waitresses you want between holidays.

1:23:23.708 --> 1:23:26.625
No one is expecting you
to drop a knee at Thanksgiving.

1:23:31.375 --> 1:23:32.583
Thanks for the update.

1:23:32.666 --> 1:23:34.625
At least I'm not the asshole this time.

1:23:34.708 --> 1:23:37.791
What is that supposed to mean?
You think I'm being an asshole?

1:23:37.875 --> 1:23:38.708
Yeah.

1:23:39.125 --> 1:23:40.666
-Me?
-Yes!

1:23:40.750 --> 1:23:44.166
You're trying so hard
not to feel anything.

1:23:44.250 --> 1:23:47.083
That means you're lying to both of us.
And that makes you an asshole.

1:23:48.125 --> 1:23:50.166
Well, I'd rather be an asshole

1:23:50.250 --> 1:23:53.875
than so desperate for companionship
that I troll the mall for a holidate.

1:23:53.958 --> 1:23:54.958
No.

1:23:55.041 --> 1:23:57.416
You were desperate enough
to take me up on the offer.

1:23:59.708 --> 1:24:01.666
-Where are you going?
-I'm going away.

1:24:01.750 --> 1:24:04.041
[scoffs] Fine. Go.

1:24:04.583 --> 1:24:07.333
I see another ugly Christmas sweater
in your future!

1:24:12.708 --> 1:24:13.875
Maybe there is.

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.291
But at least I won't be alone,

1:24:17.500 --> 1:24:20.958
sitting at the kids table,
blaming everyone else for my problems.

1:24:22.916 --> 1:24:24.166
And you know what?

1:24:25.083 --> 1:24:26.500
I bet you money,

1:24:26.583 --> 1:24:29.083
that if Ryan Gosling
waltzed down this frozen food aisle,

1:24:29.166 --> 1:24:33.458
and offered to take you on the ride
of your life, you would still say no.

1:24:36.708 --> 1:24:39.083
'Cause you'd be too afraid
to get on that train.

1:24:39.916 --> 1:24:41.500
The Ryan Gosling train.

1:24:46.125 --> 1:24:48.000
You are so wrong!

1:24:49.916 --> 1:24:53.083
Ryan Gosling would never
do his own shopping!

1:24:55.666 --> 1:24:57.416
He's way too cool for that.

1:25:01.125 --> 1:25:04.125
Well, I think you should stop
being so cheap and buy a new table.

1:25:04.208 --> 1:25:05.625
This is Mother's table!

1:25:05.708 --> 1:25:08.125
You're just jealous
because she left it to me.

1:25:08.750 --> 1:25:10.208
Because I didn't want it.

1:25:10.291 --> 1:25:12.000
I think it's a beautiful table.

1:25:12.083 --> 1:25:13.583
Oh, shut up, Warren.

1:25:13.666 --> 1:25:14.875
-Wally.
-Wally.

1:25:15.375 --> 1:25:16.625
-[Elaine chuckles]
-[door slams]

1:25:18.125 --> 1:25:19.750
Hey. Where's Jackson?

1:25:19.833 --> 1:25:21.625
Uh... don't know. Don't care.

1:25:21.708 --> 1:25:23.625
I knew it! No leaf!

1:25:23.958 --> 1:25:25.875
[Abby] Jesus, Sloane, what did you do?

1:25:26.333 --> 1:25:28.708
I didn't do anything.
What makes you think it was me?

1:25:29.375 --> 1:25:31.958
Well, honey, you don't have
the best track record.

1:25:32.041 --> 1:25:33.666
Maybe you can still apologize?

1:25:33.750 --> 1:25:36.458
-Yeah, Sloane. Jack's a good guy.
-Whoa. Wait a second.

1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:38.625
What makes you think this was my fault?

1:25:38.708 --> 1:25:42.125
-If you would be honest with him.
-Oh, you want me to be honest?

1:25:42.416 --> 1:25:44.000
Yes. Yes. And then maybe, for once,

1:25:44.083 --> 1:25:47.166
we could get through a holiday
without your personal life ruining dinner.

1:25:47.250 --> 1:25:48.625
My personal life?

1:25:48.708 --> 1:25:49.875
It's a mess!

1:25:49.958 --> 1:25:51.916
It's always a mess!

1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:53.583
Okay, well, my "personal life"

1:25:53.666 --> 1:25:56.916
might be a mess, but at least
I didn't kiss the Black Panther!

1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.041
You bitch.

1:25:58.416 --> 1:26:00.875
-What's the black panther?
-Jackson's friend at Halloween?

1:26:00.958 --> 1:26:02.791
He was dressed as Black Panther.
It was legit.

1:26:02.875 --> 1:26:05.583
[Peter] Wait, what?
You kissed the Black Panther?

1:26:07.750 --> 1:26:09.666
Barely. It was an accident.

1:26:09.750 --> 1:26:12.750
-I didn't see any tongue.
-You saw them kiss and didn't tell me?

1:26:12.833 --> 1:26:14.916
-You can't keep secrets.
-How do you know?

1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.250
-You know nothing about me!
-I was trick-or-treating.

1:26:17.333 --> 1:26:20.541
I trusted you.
I let you go to a party without me!

1:26:20.625 --> 1:26:21.458
[toys squeak]

1:26:21.541 --> 1:26:23.458
I go everywhere without you.

1:26:23.791 --> 1:26:25.833
And you never have time for me.

1:26:25.916 --> 1:26:28.041
-All you care about is the kids!
-One of us has to!

1:26:28.125 --> 1:26:30.291
-[loud bang]
-[Elaine] Wally!

1:26:30.375 --> 1:26:32.291
-Oh, my God! He's choking!
-York, do the Heimlich!

1:26:32.375 --> 1:26:34.208
-I don't know the Heimlich.
-How can you not?

1:26:34.291 --> 1:26:36.041
Step aside! I know the Heimlich!

1:26:36.125 --> 1:26:38.791
Stop it! He's not choking!
He's having a heart attack.

1:26:38.875 --> 1:26:40.166
Somebody call 911.

1:26:40.250 --> 1:26:42.458
-I'm on it!
-[siren wailing]

1:26:47.833 --> 1:26:50.458
-You can ride with us, ma'am.
-What? No. We're not together.

1:26:50.541 --> 1:26:53.416
-Aunt Susan, go!
-You have to come with me.

1:26:53.500 --> 1:26:54.458
-No. No, no.
-Yes.

1:26:54.541 --> 1:26:55.583
You're coming.

1:26:55.666 --> 1:26:56.500
Go! Go!

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:00.083
[siren wails]

1:27:00.166 --> 1:27:01.541
[woman chatting on PA]

1:27:01.625 --> 1:27:04.375
-He's in good hands now. Let's go.
-No.

1:27:04.458 --> 1:27:07.625
We can't go.
Your date just had a heart attack.

1:27:07.708 --> 1:27:08.958
I barely know him.

1:27:09.041 --> 1:27:10.750
I had to write his name on my arm.

1:27:11.166 --> 1:27:12.041
Look.

1:27:12.625 --> 1:27:13.458
[gasps]

1:27:14.333 --> 1:27:15.166
[Susan] Hmm.

1:27:15.916 --> 1:27:17.375
It's all my fault, you know.

1:27:18.583 --> 1:27:21.000
[sighs] I've had so many opportunities.

1:27:21.083 --> 1:27:24.041
I've had so many men that loved me.

1:27:24.291 --> 1:27:25.208
[chuckles]

1:27:26.083 --> 1:27:28.541
Once they got too close, I backed off.

1:27:29.625 --> 1:27:31.041
So, here I am at...

1:27:32.750 --> 1:27:34.916
age 49.

1:27:36.416 --> 1:27:37.541
It's too late now.

1:27:37.625 --> 1:27:38.916
Wallace Lupinski?

1:27:39.333 --> 1:27:41.375
Is anyone here for Mr. Lupinski?

1:27:42.750 --> 1:27:44.000
[woman on PA]

1:27:44.250 --> 1:27:45.125
Faarooq?

1:27:47.666 --> 1:27:48.500
Susan.

1:27:51.041 --> 1:27:52.625
You're working on Thanksgiving.

1:27:55.041 --> 1:27:56.041
Are you here for...

1:27:56.875 --> 1:27:57.833
Wallace Lupinski?

1:27:58.750 --> 1:27:59.583
Uh...

1:28:00.083 --> 1:28:00.916
No.

1:28:02.875 --> 1:28:03.958
You sure, 'cause...

1:28:04.875 --> 1:28:06.375
Oh, he's a family friend.

1:28:06.458 --> 1:28:07.833
How's he doing, by the way?

1:28:09.708 --> 1:28:10.625
Mild heart attack,

1:28:11.125 --> 1:28:12.291
but he's gonna be fine.

1:28:16.041 --> 1:28:17.250
It was nice to see you.

1:28:22.041 --> 1:28:23.833
[mutters nervously]

1:28:27.958 --> 1:28:30.208
-Say something.
-I can't. Let's just go.

1:28:30.916 --> 1:28:33.666
No. You have to say something.
Say anything, just--

1:28:34.416 --> 1:28:35.250
I fucked up!
