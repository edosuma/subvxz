WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.514
Previously on "Awkward"...

00:01.538 --> 00:02.771
I'm transferring to Wycoff.

00:02.774 --> 00:04.272
I don't know if I want you here.

00:04.296 --> 00:05.296
I slept with Luke last night.

00:05.298 --> 00:06.530
You know how this story ends.

00:06.532 --> 00:07.431
I like him.

00:07.432 --> 00:08.898
Can we have this convo later?

00:08.900 --> 00:10.242
Maybe I just had to accept

00:10.266 --> 00:12.246
that we'd both gone in
different directions.

00:12.271 --> 00:14.337
- I think we should try again.
- Me too.

00:15.352 --> 00:17.213
I was worried getting
back together with an ex

00:17.239 --> 00:18.871
would feel very "been
there, dated that,"

00:18.873 --> 00:21.515
but with Luke, everything
felt so exciting

00:21.530 --> 00:22.963
and brand-new.

00:22.966 --> 00:24.599
Maybe because for the first time

00:24.600 --> 00:26.067
I wasn't thinking about Matty.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.359
Okay, time for an intermission.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.370
We're late for work.

00:29.371 --> 00:30.414
Work, right.

00:30.439 --> 00:32.539
I knew there was a reason
we were just standing here.

00:38.078 --> 00:39.122
Hey, hons.

00:39.148 --> 00:41.014
Why are you so 2000-and-late this morning?

00:41.039 --> 00:42.984
We got a little, uh, distracted.

00:42.985 --> 00:45.587
Talking about article
ideas, just spitballing.

00:45.588 --> 00:46.741
Lost track of time.

00:47.045 --> 00:48.957
God bless you nerds.

00:48.959 --> 00:50.091
Spitballing.

00:50.460 --> 00:51.493
What?

00:51.881 --> 00:53.161
Why didn't you just tell him the truth?

00:53.162 --> 00:55.597
What, you don't want him to
find out you're into girls?

00:55.929 --> 00:59.500
Look, Jenna, no one can
know we like each other.

01:01.837 --> 01:04.805
Suddenly my relationship with
Luke was feeling less brand-new

01:04.807 --> 01:08.308
and more like a bad case
of sophomore year dÃ©jÄ‚Â  vu.

Synced and corrected by Chitorafa

01:13.664 --> 01:15.582
What do you mean, no one
can know we like each other?

01:15.585 --> 01:17.218
Are you, like, embarrassed
of me or something?

01:17.219 --> 01:18.286
- Jenna.
- No, you know what.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.390
I have been kept a secret before.

01:19.414 --> 01:21.332
I know how this goes,
and I am not interested.

01:21.358 --> 01:22.623
Whoa, slow down.

01:25.861 --> 01:27.629
I'm not embarrassed of you, okay?

01:27.631 --> 01:29.230
I just want to make sure
you get taken seriously here.

01:29.231 --> 01:30.765
You were the one who
didn't want people to think

01:30.766 --> 01:32.700
you got this job
because of me, remember?

01:32.701 --> 01:34.134
I'm a second year editorial fellow,

01:34.137 --> 01:36.603
which means technically
I'm your superior.

01:36.605 --> 01:37.938
If people see us
dating, they might think

01:37.941 --> 01:39.740
you're getting some kind
of special treatment.

01:39.742 --> 01:41.376
Oh, I guess that makes sense.

01:41.378 --> 01:42.810
You're just starting out here.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.078
You haven't even gotten
anything published yet.

01:44.079 --> 01:45.546
Well, it's not for lack of trying.

01:45.549 --> 01:46.781
I'm constantly submitting pieces,

01:46.783 --> 01:48.182
and they keep getting rejected.

01:48.185 --> 01:50.459
Last year, it took me
nearly the entire summer

01:50.484 --> 01:52.158
to get something published on the site.

01:52.183 --> 01:54.528
Just be patient, and it will happen.

01:54.554 --> 01:57.347
This is gonna be the best
thing for both of us, I promise.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.081
Plus, we'll get to hide from our bosses

02:00.105 --> 02:03.340
and meet up in random
places around the office.

02:04.176 --> 02:05.579
Being a secret is gonna be hot.

02:07.579 --> 02:09.168
Luke's reason for keeping us

02:09.205 --> 02:10.901
in the couple's closet made sense,

02:10.925 --> 02:13.593
but was he really telling
me the complete truth?

02:14.040 --> 02:15.188
Hey.

02:15.878 --> 02:17.131
- 'Sup, Jenna?
- Hey, guys.

02:17.133 --> 02:19.834
- How was everyone's weekend?
- So good.

02:19.836 --> 02:21.602
Ethan and I went paddleboating
around the marina,

02:21.603 --> 02:23.070
and then we flew kites in the park.

02:23.073 --> 02:24.705
It was a little twee overload,

02:24.707 --> 02:26.206
but sometimes you just have to reconnect

02:26.209 --> 02:28.443
with your inner child, you know?

02:28.444 --> 02:29.644
You guys have been spending

02:29.646 --> 02:31.045
a lot more time together recently.

02:31.046 --> 02:32.780
Are you getting him to reconsider

02:32.781 --> 02:34.014
his position on girls?

02:34.016 --> 02:35.849
I decided that I would wait on that

02:35.852 --> 02:37.050
until summer was over.

02:37.052 --> 02:38.319
I mean, he is my coworker,

02:38.320 --> 02:40.754
and even I have some
professional boundaries.

02:40.757 --> 02:42.990
Wow, if the person who talks openly

02:42.991 --> 02:45.158
about being sexually
attracted to her cousin

02:45.161 --> 02:47.550
won't discuss hooking
up with a coworker,

02:47.574 --> 02:50.430
maybe this office romance
stuff really was taboo.

02:50.432 --> 02:51.637
All right, listen up, people.

02:51.662 --> 02:53.473
It's time for morning announcements.

02:53.937 --> 02:55.802
Traffic is on fire right now

02:55.805 --> 02:57.504
thanks to Ophelia's beautiful piece

02:57.507 --> 02:59.439
on how unattractive her breasts are.

03:00.253 --> 03:02.543
Now, we need to keep
momentum going, so this week

03:02.544 --> 03:04.645
when you are pitching your
article ideas to Ethan,

03:04.646 --> 03:06.980
I want you to be thinking big and viral.

03:06.983 --> 03:07.840
Just make sure it's something

03:07.865 --> 03:09.581
that people are gonna be obsessed with.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.085
Oh, Jenna, that reminds me,

03:11.086 --> 03:12.552
I just finished reading your piece

03:12.555 --> 03:14.322
on growing up in the
age of social media.

03:14.324 --> 03:16.257
I felt like you were
trying a little too hard

03:16.259 --> 03:18.425
to sound like a sophisticated know-it-all.

03:18.427 --> 03:21.228
Next time, I want you to just
write in your natural voice,

03:21.230 --> 03:23.371
even if it sounds a little unpolished.

03:24.340 --> 03:25.199
Okay.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.467
Now, moving on to even
more exciting news.

03:27.469 --> 03:28.878
Ever since traffic exploded,

03:28.903 --> 03:31.204
advertisers have been clamoring
to buy space on the site,

03:31.206 --> 03:33.831
which means that we need
an ad sales intern ASAP.

03:33.855 --> 03:37.088
So if you know anyone who
likes working on commission,

03:37.114 --> 03:38.478
is driven, type-A,

03:38.480 --> 03:41.014
and persistent to the
point of being annoying,

03:41.016 --> 03:42.716
please, send them my way.

03:42.718 --> 03:46.454
Hmm, I knew someone who
fit that description to a T.

03:46.456 --> 03:48.656
OMG! I got the job!

03:48.658 --> 03:50.191
Yay! I knew you would.

03:50.192 --> 03:51.759
And we'll get to work
together, which is great

03:51.760 --> 03:53.394
'cause I feel like I
haven't seen you that much.

03:53.396 --> 03:55.962
I know, I'm sorry. I'm
totes going to BFF jail.

03:55.965 --> 03:58.647
But that all changes after today.

03:59.465 --> 04:02.370
Ah, I will see you tomorrow
at our place of employment.

04:02.372 --> 04:03.503
Ahh!

04:03.506 --> 04:04.402
In some ways,

04:04.427 --> 04:05.996
Idea Bin felt less like a workplace

04:06.020 --> 04:08.443
and more like a high school cafeteria.

04:08.444 --> 04:09.895
But now that I had Tamara,

04:09.919 --> 04:11.945
maybe things would all fall into place.

04:11.948 --> 04:13.681
The only question was:

04:13.682 --> 04:16.380
Could I really handle
being a secret again?

04:16.886 --> 04:19.754
I guess there was only
one way to find out.

04:21.745 --> 04:23.995
Oh, yes, Matty, over here.

04:24.019 --> 04:26.153
Can you move? My friend
wants to sit next to me.

04:26.156 --> 04:27.064
Thank you.

04:27.824 --> 04:29.891
Hey, Mrs. Hamilton.

04:29.893 --> 04:32.192
Oh, come on, Matty. Call me Lacey.

04:32.194 --> 04:33.199
What are you doing here?

04:33.225 --> 04:34.656
I didn't know you were in summer school.

04:34.668 --> 04:37.558
Yeah, I, uh... I had a rough semester.

04:37.584 --> 04:40.072
Oh, did you have a baby?

04:40.074 --> 04:41.106
No.

04:41.108 --> 04:43.009
Well, then mine was rougher.

04:43.011 --> 04:44.620
Guten Tag, class.

04:44.887 --> 04:46.913
Welcome to Intro to German.

04:46.915 --> 04:48.413
First thing I want you to do

04:48.415 --> 04:50.730
is look at the person seated next to you

04:50.755 --> 04:52.050
and shake their hand.

04:54.288 --> 04:56.122
This will be your conversation partner

04:56.124 --> 04:57.856
for the next eight weeks.

04:57.858 --> 05:00.526
Oh, boo-ya, everybody!

05:00.528 --> 05:02.798
I got the best partner.

05:03.665 --> 05:05.831
This is gonna be so much fun!

05:05.857 --> 05:08.173
Good. Okay.

05:08.403 --> 05:10.324
You are so freaking hot.

05:10.341 --> 05:11.278
The girls I meet on Flinger

05:11.302 --> 05:12.836
usually turn out to be kinda busted,

05:12.863 --> 05:15.158
but you are even better
than your profile pics.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.502
Duh, you made a great
decision when you swiped right.

05:17.528 --> 05:19.327
Man, I cannot believe
that you chose this place

05:19.329 --> 05:20.223
for our first date.

05:20.247 --> 05:21.997
You are so low-maintenance, I love it.

05:21.999 --> 05:23.398
Next in line. Oh.

05:24.601 --> 05:26.235
What are you doing here, Sadita?

05:26.237 --> 05:29.237
Hey, Sergio. God, I totally
forgot you worked here.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.639
Uh, my name's on the food truck.

05:31.641 --> 05:33.341
Must've slipped my mind.

05:33.343 --> 05:38.134
Anyway, can we have two
chicken tamales, no forks.

05:38.158 --> 05:40.853
He likes to feed it to me.

05:41.862 --> 05:43.552
Two chicken tamales, por favor.

05:43.553 --> 05:45.487
You got it, papi.

05:52.290 --> 05:55.930
Hey, so you want to go to your
place after this for dessert?

05:55.932 --> 05:57.165
I'll feed it to you.

05:57.168 --> 05:58.968
I think I just lost my appetite

05:58.970 --> 06:00.735
for the next 10,000 years.

06:00.737 --> 06:02.237
Whoa, you were just all over me.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.107
Yeah, and now I'm just over you.

06:05.108 --> 06:06.305
Buh-bye!

06:07.944 --> 06:09.478
I'm so nervous, Jenna.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.579
I bought this chic Isabel
Marant blazer yesterday,

06:11.581 --> 06:13.148
and I still feel like
a young unprofessional.

06:13.149 --> 06:14.817
Got any workplace survival tips for me?

06:14.819 --> 06:16.050
I want all the 411.

06:16.052 --> 06:17.620
Actually, there is one thing.

06:17.622 --> 06:18.786
Try not to take it personally

06:18.788 --> 06:20.122
if my coworkers act a little rude.

06:20.124 --> 06:21.557
They're like that with everyone.

06:21.559 --> 06:23.125
I mean, they still
haven't even invited me

06:23.127 --> 06:24.735
out to lunch with them yet.

06:26.048 --> 06:28.940
Babe, I am luh-huving your hair journey.

06:28.966 --> 06:31.867
And your outfit. Very
young professional.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.701
OMG. Thanks, you guys.

06:33.704 --> 06:34.903
Where did you come from?

06:34.906 --> 06:37.305
Well, this is Tamara, my best friend

06:37.307 --> 06:39.408
and the new ad sales intern.

06:39.409 --> 06:42.384
Cute. Hey, do you want to have
lunch with me and Oaf later?

06:42.408 --> 06:44.079
That would be awesome.

06:44.081 --> 06:45.480
God, Jenna was just telling me

06:45.483 --> 06:47.449
how some of her coworkers are so rude,

06:47.451 --> 06:49.555
they haven't even invited her to lunch.

06:49.579 --> 06:52.172
Can you believe it? What A-holes.

06:52.697 --> 06:53.788
Oh, my God, that's so terrible.

06:53.790 --> 06:55.728
Who are these A-holes, Jenna?

06:59.672 --> 07:00.718
The secret was out

07:00.726 --> 07:02.538
that I thought my coworkers were jerks,

07:02.562 --> 07:04.125
but I couldn't let that or the fact

07:04.132 --> 07:06.654
that I was secretly making out
with my boyfriend bother me.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.247
I know, Rhonda,

07:08.249 --> 07:10.949
but we will talk all about
it on Tuesday at drinks.

07:10.951 --> 07:12.317
LYLAS!

07:12.319 --> 07:14.254
OMG, you guys, she just
bought so much ad space,

07:14.255 --> 07:16.834
and all I had to do was make
fake plans to have drinks.

07:17.893 --> 07:20.093
T, I have literal R.L.
Stine goose bumps right now.

07:20.095 --> 07:21.194
That was amazing.

07:21.196 --> 07:22.394
You know, watching you hustle

07:22.396 --> 07:24.096
reminds me of this awesome woman I know.

07:24.098 --> 07:25.038
It's me.

07:25.466 --> 07:28.029
Hey, everyone. Sorry I'm late.

07:28.055 --> 07:31.148
Luke, and I got caught
up with some super serious

07:31.173 --> 07:32.706
and work-related stuff.

07:32.707 --> 07:34.740
Oh, hey, Jenna. Can I
make another phone call?

07:34.742 --> 07:35.875
It's so much fun pretending to care

07:35.899 --> 07:37.156
about other people's lives.

07:37.187 --> 07:39.454
Of course! Live your truth, you know?

07:40.132 --> 07:41.677
Getting ignored by the cool kids,

07:41.702 --> 07:43.288
I was used to that from high school,

07:43.312 --> 07:45.812
but having my best friend
be one of the cool kids

07:45.838 --> 07:47.637
was a cruel new twist.

07:48.819 --> 07:50.610
Excuse me, can I order a drink?

07:50.634 --> 07:51.593
I'm not a bartender.

07:51.619 --> 07:53.899
Do you mind watching little
Jackson? I have a tennis lesson.

07:53.915 --> 07:56.816
- Sorry, not a manny.
- Jake, I need an outlet.

07:56.817 --> 07:58.605
If my phone dies, I die.

07:58.630 --> 08:00.398
Sadie, you've been looking
at that phone all day.

08:00.423 --> 08:01.855
What are you even doing on there?

08:01.858 --> 08:03.156
Setting up dates on Flinger,

08:03.158 --> 08:04.492
and it's real slim pickins today.

08:04.494 --> 08:06.295
Why are you trying to
go on so many dates?

08:07.930 --> 08:09.920
Hey! I'm not the pool boy.

08:09.946 --> 08:11.245
I'm a freakin' manager.

08:11.247 --> 08:12.812
Doesn't anyone respect me around here?

08:12.851 --> 08:15.218
I'm trying to make Sergio jealous, duh!

08:15.221 --> 08:16.987
And I've taken, like,
half the guys from Flinger

08:16.990 --> 08:18.500
to his food truck,
and for whatever reason

08:18.524 --> 08:20.288
he doesn't seem to give a [bleep].

08:20.321 --> 08:21.757
Well, if you really want him to care,

08:21.774 --> 08:23.507
you have to make him think
you're in a relationship.

08:23.509 --> 08:26.576
He's not gonna believe that
about some rando online.

08:26.579 --> 08:27.701
Jake.

08:28.774 --> 08:31.158
You like tamales, right?

08:35.413 --> 08:37.221
Oh, Matty! Hey, Matty!

08:37.222 --> 08:39.956
Oh, it's just heels. Matty, wait.

08:40.586 --> 08:41.552
Hold on one sec.

08:41.577 --> 08:42.793
Hey, sorry, I'm kind of in a hurry.

08:42.794 --> 08:43.875
What's up?

08:43.899 --> 08:46.567
Look, I know why
you've been ignoring me.

08:47.047 --> 08:49.100
If you want a conversation
partner who's your own age,

08:49.101 --> 08:51.335
who you can talk to about yodel or YOLO

08:51.336 --> 08:52.970
or whatever it's called, it's fine.

08:52.971 --> 08:54.850
I... I understand.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.514
What? No, that's not it.

08:56.538 --> 08:58.529
Uh, come on. You're not even that old.

08:58.554 --> 09:01.701
Oh. Thanks. I think.

09:01.726 --> 09:03.826
It's just that I feel
kinda weird around you

09:03.828 --> 09:06.101
because of what happened
with me and Jenna.

09:07.099 --> 09:08.365
Yeah.

09:08.366 --> 09:10.033
Yeah, she told me all about the breakup.

09:10.034 --> 09:11.062
She did?

09:11.087 --> 09:12.836
How she felt like she
was holding you back,

09:12.837 --> 09:15.071
and you were scared to
say anything about it.

09:15.072 --> 09:16.783
Sounds pretty intense.

09:19.143 --> 09:21.043
Okay, guys, before we
dive into your pitches,

09:21.046 --> 09:24.177
I want to give a major
congrats to my babe, Oaf.

09:24.202 --> 09:27.999
Her recent article has over
a million Facebook shares.

09:28.024 --> 09:30.702
So who's got the next
million-shares post for me?

09:30.719 --> 09:32.219
- Huh?
- I've got something.

09:32.221 --> 09:33.620
What about a listicle called

09:33.623 --> 09:35.322
"The Five Books That
Will Change Your Life"?

09:35.325 --> 09:36.724
I could do a little write-up

09:36.725 --> 09:38.558
on "The History of
Sexuality" by Foucault.

09:38.561 --> 09:40.061
Foucault? Fou-no, babe!

09:40.062 --> 09:42.196
Newsflash, Middle America
doesn't even know who that is.

09:42.221 --> 09:43.196
I mean, the only people that read him

09:43.221 --> 09:44.787
are snoozy liberal arts girls, ha.

09:45.312 --> 09:46.701
- No offense.
- A little taken.

09:46.702 --> 09:48.568
- Anyone else?
- Well, I had this idea...

09:48.571 --> 09:50.327
Hey, you guys, don't be mad,

09:50.352 --> 09:52.787
but no one can listen to vinyl anymore.

09:53.109 --> 09:56.114
'Cause I freaking broke
all the sales records.

09:57.461 --> 09:59.980
Um, T, did you check the
weather forecast today?

09:59.982 --> 10:03.183
Because it says to expect
some heavy compliment showers.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.452
Oh, thank G, I'm always
dressed for compliments.

10:05.455 --> 10:06.620
- Go.
- You're amazing.

10:06.623 --> 10:07.508
- Stop.
- My obsession.

10:07.533 --> 10:08.015
No.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.456
Checking into rehab
'cause I'm addicted to you.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.772
- Love.
- I actually have an idea.

10:11.797 --> 10:12.875
Hold that thought.

10:13.062 --> 10:15.831
We all know there's a lot
of talent here at Idea Bin.

10:16.429 --> 10:18.385
I mean, Max of course.

10:18.446 --> 10:22.681
Mia, your recent essay examining
racism in the movie "Clueless"

10:22.682 --> 10:24.850
has got some serious potential.

10:24.851 --> 10:27.552
Luke, your think pieces
always give our site

10:27.554 --> 10:28.530
more street cred.

10:28.556 --> 10:31.667
And, Jenna, you are here every day.

10:31.692 --> 10:33.094
But there is someone in this room

10:33.119 --> 10:34.547
with a singular voice

10:34.572 --> 10:38.615
that I literally cannot get enough of.

10:38.937 --> 10:41.871
Tamara, I am reserving a
spot for you on the home page

10:41.874 --> 10:44.174
for an essay due from
you tomorrow morning.

10:44.177 --> 10:44.985
Ah!

10:45.009 --> 10:46.610
OMG. "Tamara" morning.

10:46.625 --> 10:47.524
- Oh
- Ah!

10:47.527 --> 10:50.494
- Stop! Stop.
- Stop it.

10:50.890 --> 10:52.928
I suddenly felt a strong urge

10:52.953 --> 10:55.548
to call in sick "Tamara" morning.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.294
- Ow.
- Sorry. Are you hurt?

11:01.311 --> 11:03.053
- It's fine.
- Okay.

11:04.313 --> 11:06.714
Okay, you know what, I can't do this.

11:07.783 --> 11:09.754
What's wrong?

11:09.779 --> 11:11.746
What's wrong is that I'm 19 years old

11:11.749 --> 11:13.264
and having a secret
hook-up with the guy I like

11:13.287 --> 11:14.326
in a utility closet.

11:14.350 --> 11:16.192
What's wrong is that everybody hates me,

11:16.216 --> 11:17.302
and the one person who's supposed

11:17.311 --> 11:18.638
to make me feel better about it

11:18.647 --> 11:20.840
is too busy palling around
with the popular kids

11:20.865 --> 11:22.664
and getting published
to even hang out with me.

11:22.668 --> 11:24.500
Jenna, I told you, I'm
not keeping us a secret

11:24.503 --> 11:26.302
because I'm embarrassed by you.

11:26.304 --> 11:28.638
All right, I'm sorry.

11:28.639 --> 11:30.941
Guess I just have a little PTSD.

11:31.216 --> 11:33.009
It's all right. I get it.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.345
And I also get how
you feel about Tamara.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.756
Just talk to her about it, okay?

11:37.020 --> 11:38.315
You'll feel better when
you get some clarity.

11:38.544 --> 11:41.084
Oh, for a secret boyfriend,
you sure are supportive.

11:41.086 --> 11:43.153
Uh, so you're making jokes.

11:43.154 --> 11:45.254
Does that mean everything's
better between us?

11:45.256 --> 11:46.763
- Yeah.
- Good.

11:47.558 --> 11:50.312
And this time, I meant it.

11:51.091 --> 11:54.548
So the deal is 50 bucks
plus unlimited tamales,

11:54.573 --> 11:57.067
and I have to be back at work at 5:30.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.716
Apparently I'm the only
one at the country club

11:58.725 --> 12:00.692
who can refill a canister of napkins.

12:00.693 --> 12:02.059
Whatever, just come on.

12:02.427 --> 12:05.431
Sergio, isn't that your ex girl?

12:06.794 --> 12:08.538
I ain't worried about it, mama.

12:10.302 --> 12:12.567
Long time no see, Sadita.

12:12.591 --> 12:13.837
What can I get you guys?

12:13.840 --> 12:15.139
What are you in the mood for, babe?

12:15.142 --> 12:16.807
I know you usually like cheese tamales,

12:16.809 --> 12:18.243
but what if we went with beef?

12:18.245 --> 12:22.980
Oh, that's a great idea, my sweet rose.

12:22.982 --> 12:26.750
Ten beef tamales with onions.

12:26.753 --> 12:29.534
So you guys are dating now, huh?

12:29.559 --> 12:31.418
Yeah, we've been friends for so long,

12:31.443 --> 12:33.711
and one thing led to another and...

12:34.600 --> 12:36.059
Well, that's awesome.

12:36.084 --> 12:38.418
Step this way. We gotta get
you on the Wall of Lovers.

12:38.419 --> 12:39.477
Come on.

12:40.365 --> 12:41.488
Yeah.

12:41.490 --> 12:44.323
Say "lovers forever and ever."

12:44.326 --> 12:46.365
Mwah!

12:47.086 --> 12:48.380
Oh.

12:53.317 --> 12:54.734
Hey, T, you have a second?

12:54.735 --> 12:56.101
Sure. What's up?

12:56.434 --> 12:57.604
So you're writing an article now.

12:57.605 --> 12:58.904
That's so crazy.

12:58.907 --> 13:00.091
I didn't even know you liked to write.

13:00.116 --> 13:01.528
I don't really, but I like to talk,

13:01.553 --> 13:03.018
and it's sort of the same thing, right?

13:03.583 --> 13:04.474
Not exactly.

13:04.499 --> 13:06.822
Writing is actually way
more difficult than talking.

13:06.847 --> 13:08.313
I'm sure it can't be that hard.

13:08.316 --> 13:10.283
G2G, I'm meeting up
with Ethan and Ophelia

13:10.284 --> 13:11.393
for happy hour.

13:12.099 --> 13:13.441
Happy hour?

13:14.263 --> 13:15.886
- Okay, we need to talk.
- About what?

13:15.912 --> 13:17.856
About how you've been acting
like a total jerk to me

13:17.859 --> 13:19.683
ever since you got back from New York.

13:19.708 --> 13:21.193
You're sharing all these
inside jokes with Sadie.

13:21.196 --> 13:23.163
You dress totally different,
and now you're buddying up

13:23.164 --> 13:24.931
to Ethan and Ophelia and leaving me out?

13:24.932 --> 13:26.666
It's like you think
you're too good for me now.

13:26.668 --> 13:30.495
Ugh, I'm too good for you?

13:30.520 --> 13:33.405
Please, Jenna, you've
turned into a total snob.

13:33.408 --> 13:36.009
I'm sorry that I didn't spend
the first year of college

13:36.010 --> 13:37.710
sitting around reading pretentious books

13:37.711 --> 13:39.345
with my super smart friends.

13:39.346 --> 13:42.315
I like clothes and
going out and having fun.

13:42.317 --> 13:43.548
So sue me.

13:45.123 --> 13:46.119
I guess things have changed,

13:46.120 --> 13:48.128
and we're just different people now.

13:49.481 --> 13:50.806
Guess so.

13:56.129 --> 13:59.164
I can't believe your
pathetic excuse for a kiss.

13:59.167 --> 14:01.267
Me? You weren't exactly
bringing the heat.

14:01.269 --> 14:04.692
Well, who orders ten tamales
with onions on a date?

14:04.716 --> 14:06.730
Now Sergio definitely
knows we're faking.

14:06.755 --> 14:09.255
I don't get why you're trying
so hard to make him jealous.

14:09.740 --> 14:12.298
You never had trouble moving
on with any other guys.

14:13.296 --> 14:16.129
I wanna win the breakup,

14:16.131 --> 14:18.224
and I thought if any of my
friends could make him jealous,

14:18.249 --> 14:19.447
then it'd be you.

14:19.472 --> 14:21.869
- Why me?
- What are you doing, mijo?

14:22.395 --> 14:24.705
I thought you weren't worried
about Sadie and that guero.

14:24.706 --> 14:25.841
I'm not.

14:26.013 --> 14:28.385
I know she's just trying
to make me jealous.

14:29.044 --> 14:31.434
I guess I just miss fighting with her.

14:33.052 --> 14:34.130
Come on, let's hug.

14:34.155 --> 14:35.522
Ew. Really?

14:35.981 --> 14:37.552
I'm gonna do something,
but you gotta promise

14:37.553 --> 14:39.221
not to punch me in the balls.

14:45.591 --> 14:49.197
And I miss the making up even more.

14:51.033 --> 14:52.533
Guten Tag, Matty.

14:52.534 --> 14:57.071
Ich... something, something Lacey.

14:57.474 --> 14:58.875
Guten Tag, Lacey.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.717
"Don-kay"? "Don-key"?

15:01.231 --> 15:03.144
How do you say, "This is
bull[bleep]" in German?

15:03.145 --> 15:05.418
Jenna's not coming home soon, is she?

15:07.662 --> 15:08.809
She might.

15:08.835 --> 15:10.835
Then I should probably get going.

15:11.208 --> 15:12.605
Matty, wait.

15:12.630 --> 15:13.599
I don't know why you and Jenna

15:13.624 --> 15:15.255
are giving each other
the silent treatment.

15:15.258 --> 15:17.491
I mean, I get that
breakups can be terrible,

15:17.494 --> 15:20.604
but yours just seemed, well, sad.

15:21.216 --> 15:25.106
Listen, uh, what Jenna
told you about our breakup,

15:25.645 --> 15:27.768
that's not exactly how it went down.

15:27.769 --> 15:29.370
Oh, my God, did someone cheat?

15:29.371 --> 15:30.677
- No.
- Did Jenna get pregnant?

15:30.701 --> 15:33.662
No, no, it was because I
wanted to transfer to Wycoff,

15:33.687 --> 15:35.153
and Jenna said no.

15:35.177 --> 15:36.677
Wycoff?

15:37.263 --> 15:38.231
Why?

15:38.256 --> 15:39.498
You didn't like Berkeley?

15:39.523 --> 15:41.418
Uh, not at first, no.

15:41.443 --> 15:43.698
I know this might sound kinda lame,

15:43.724 --> 15:46.849
but in high school I felt...

15:47.149 --> 15:49.517
I don't know, like I was important,

15:49.519 --> 15:52.318
and when I went to Berkeley,
I just became this, like,

15:52.321 --> 15:54.621
random dude overnight,
and it kinda sucked.

15:54.624 --> 15:55.855
Yeah, I get it.

15:55.857 --> 15:57.457
Small fish in a big pond.

15:57.460 --> 15:58.856
Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

15:58.881 --> 16:00.356
And I thought running
away and being with Jenna

16:00.381 --> 16:03.926
would fix everything, which
of course that was dumb.

16:03.951 --> 16:06.399
And Jenna was totally right
not to let me transfer,

16:06.402 --> 16:10.365
but at the time, I was
kind of a jerk about it.

16:11.130 --> 16:13.184
And I just figured
that's what she told you.

16:13.210 --> 16:14.177
Nope.

16:15.287 --> 16:16.169
Hmm.

16:17.028 --> 16:19.312
Well, it's nice to know
she's still got my back.

16:21.750 --> 16:25.451
Why don't you stick around
and tell her that yourself?

16:25.475 --> 16:26.875
I don't think we're there yet.

16:27.088 --> 16:28.083
It's better if I just go.

16:28.109 --> 16:29.673
Okay, I'll see you...

16:30.981 --> 16:33.293
God, what is the German
word for "tomorrow"?

16:33.296 --> 16:34.677
I'll see you later.

16:35.998 --> 16:37.498
Morgen.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.074

17:06.559 --> 17:08.520
Things at Idea Bin had gone from bad

17:08.521 --> 17:09.887
to high school hell.

17:09.891 --> 17:11.324
With Tamara and I on the outs

17:11.326 --> 17:13.358
and no sign of ever getting published,

17:13.362 --> 17:15.127
maybe it was finally time to admit

17:15.130 --> 17:16.962
that I'd never belong there.

17:24.786 --> 17:27.957
Jenna, you were right. We are different.

17:27.981 --> 17:30.615
You're a writer, and
I'm not. This is hard.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.567
Help.

17:34.326 --> 17:35.425
Listen, I'm really sorry

17:35.427 --> 17:37.036
about everything I said to you today,

17:37.060 --> 17:39.356
slash everything I've said
to you the entire summer.

17:39.382 --> 17:40.681
I was a total bitch witch,

17:40.682 --> 17:43.519
and I understand if you want
to revoke my BFF privileges.

17:44.025 --> 17:45.040
Come on.

17:45.066 --> 17:46.365
You haven't been that bad.

17:46.391 --> 17:48.387
Yeah, I have, and I'm really sorry.

17:48.596 --> 17:50.068
I don't give a flying F

17:50.094 --> 17:52.561
if you know fancy
designers or nightclubs.

17:52.564 --> 17:55.163
Thanks, and I guess I
don't care if you don't know

17:55.165 --> 17:57.432
about Kathleen Hanna
or read Judith Butler.

17:57.458 --> 17:58.809
Judith Butler. Who's that?

17:58.835 --> 18:00.233
She sounds really boring.

18:00.471 --> 18:02.438
I just want to be best friends again.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.038
I miss you. I miss us.

18:05.469 --> 18:06.403
Me too.

18:09.294 --> 18:11.780
Okay, let's take a look
at this article of yours.

18:11.782 --> 18:13.571
I'm sure it can't be that bad.

18:18.655 --> 18:20.461
Or maybe it can.

18:44.012 --> 18:46.115
It took all night, but Tamara and I

18:46.116 --> 18:48.683
finally fixed her article
and our friendship.

18:48.685 --> 18:50.059
Now it didn't matter if I felt like

18:50.085 --> 18:52.188
I was back in high school at Idea Bin.

18:52.190 --> 18:54.457
As long as I had T, I could be me.

18:54.459 --> 18:56.926
Whoa, someone's feeling brave today.

18:56.951 --> 18:58.384
I can't help myself.

18:58.989 --> 19:00.333
I am so proud of you.

19:00.357 --> 19:01.422
What for?

19:01.446 --> 19:03.122
- Your post.
- _

19:03.458 --> 19:06.057
Don't our names look adorbs together?

19:06.442 --> 19:08.804
Totally adorbs. Thank you.

19:08.806 --> 19:11.140
Hons, I just read your article,

19:11.142 --> 19:12.642
and I loved it.

19:12.644 --> 19:14.343
T, who know you were
such a natural writer?

19:14.345 --> 19:16.679
Oh, spoiler alert,
Jenna wrote most of it.

19:16.681 --> 19:19.691
I just ate 500 chips
and paced back and forth.

19:19.715 --> 19:21.584
See, Jenna, I knew the second
you stopped trying so hard

19:21.586 --> 19:22.861
you'd actually write something great.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.910
I'm V, V, proud of you.

19:25.222 --> 19:26.090
In fact, hey,

19:26.115 --> 19:28.250
you want to go to happy hour
after work and celebrate?

19:28.326 --> 19:30.792
OMG! We would love to!

19:30.958 --> 19:33.095
But Jenna and I are gonna
do our own thing tonight.

20:07.932 --> 20:09.265
So then I said,

20:09.267 --> 20:10.900
"Babe, call me when you gentrify,

20:10.902 --> 20:12.701
"because your body
is a little too unsafe

20:12.703 --> 20:14.903
for me to be walking
around it at night."

20:14.905 --> 20:15.904
I know, right?

20:15.906 --> 20:17.573
Living out loud can cause deafness,

20:17.575 --> 20:19.162
so bring your headphones.

20:20.112 --> 20:22.417
Anyway, tell that story about the camp.

20:23.714 --> 20:24.901
You've reached Jenna Hamilton.

20:24.925 --> 20:27.298
Leave a message.
