03:00.800 --> 03:02.131
Becca?

03:02.435 --> 03:03.561
Becca?

03:06.472 --> 03:09.168
- Hey, Peg.
- It looks so nice back here.

03:09.441 --> 03:12.137
Well, I'm just, you know,
trying to get things back into shape.

03:12.243 --> 03:14.939
Listen, we were wondering
if you and Howie were free tonight.

03:15.046 --> 03:18.345
- We're having a few people over for dinner.
- That's very sweet of you, Peg.

03:18.450 --> 03:21.578
- I know, it's really short notice...
- Actually, we have plans.

03:22.953 --> 03:27.117
But another time, though?
Yeah, I haven't talked to Pete in ages.

03:27.224 --> 03:30.955
You haven't missed much.
He's still the same SOB he always was.

03:31.661 --> 03:34.357
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

03:35.531 --> 03:37.158
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

03:37.266 --> 03:40.292
- No, no, no. No, it's fine.
- These stupid feet.

03:41.571 --> 03:43.869
Well, have a great dinner, Peg.

03:44.706 --> 03:48.005
- We'll do it again next time.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

03:49.645 --> 03:52.614
- Say hi to Howie for me.
- I sure will.

03:53.849 --> 03:56.215
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

04:19.103 --> 04:22.904
- Smells good in there.
- Hey, if Peg asks, we went out tonight.

04:25.744 --> 04:27.712
Where did we go?

04:27.813 --> 04:31.647
- Saw the Stoppard play.
- Really? Did we enjoy it?

04:32.250 --> 04:33.547
Very much.

04:35.586 --> 04:37.747
She asked us to dinner again.

04:39.490 --> 04:43.586
- She's just being nice.
- You're more than welcome to go over there.

04:51.368 --> 04:55.498
- And abandon your risotto?
- Careful, Howie. The pan's hot.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.342
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm gonna hop in the shower.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.546
About 20 minutes.

05:32.305 --> 05:33.431
Hello?

05:37.810 --> 05:39.801
What time is it?

05:42.380 --> 05:43.574
What's going on?

05:47.886 --> 05:49.183
Thank you.

05:58.629 --> 06:02.565
- Have you got nothing to say?
- Thank you?

06:04.101 --> 06:07.628
- You were in a bar fight.
- It wasn't a bar fight.

06:07.737 --> 06:12.299
- You were in a bar fighting.
- It wasn't a fight.

06:12.408 --> 06:15.741
Some drunk girl was screaming in my face,
so I hit her and that was the end of it.

06:15.845 --> 06:18.507
- Well, who was she?
- I don't know.

06:19.314 --> 06:21.407
People don't just scream at you
for no reason.

06:21.517 --> 06:24.611
Sure they do! You should get out more.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.918
- God, Izzy, it's so Jerry Springer.
- What does that mean?

06:29.024 --> 06:30.685
What, do you think I'm trashy?

06:30.892 --> 06:33.417
You can't keep doing this.
You're not a kid anymore.

06:33.528 --> 06:35.018
I didn't know there was a cut-off date.

06:35.129 --> 06:38.895
Yeah, for acting like a jackass,
there's a cut-off date.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.524
I want to stop worrying about you.

06:41.536 --> 06:45.028
Hey, don't worry about me.
She was the one on the floor.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.041
Can I stay with you tonight?

07:04.723 --> 07:07.123
I got you! I got you!

07:07.692 --> 07:09.387
Danny, look at me when you turn back.

07:09.494 --> 07:11.894
- He's getting juice.
- No, he's not.

07:12.964 --> 07:14.761
Danny, look at this.

07:15.433 --> 07:17.264
Now, Danny,
I'm gonna tell you a secret, okay?

07:17.368 --> 07:20.303
When you go back down,
I want you to give Mom a big kiss, okay?

07:20.404 --> 07:24.238
Ready? One, two, three. That was high!

07:28.145 --> 07:30.705
- Danny, look at me when you come back.
- He's getting juice.

07:30.813 --> 07:32.405
- You want any cake?
- Yes.

07:32.515 --> 07:33.641
Do we have cake today?

07:33.749 --> 07:34.773
- Yeah, we do.
- Yes.

07:34.884 --> 07:37.409
- We do?
- No, it's brownies. Come on.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.284
Oh, my gosh. You really want some.

08:05.511 --> 08:07.001
Well, if it isn't Ma Barker.

08:07.113 --> 08:09.172
I'm sure that would be very funny
if I knew who that was.

08:09.716 --> 08:12.583
Rick and I are gonna play squash.
I have my cell if you need me.

08:12.685 --> 08:16.280
- Yeah.
- Squash. You go play squash, Howie.

08:16.389 --> 08:20.018
- You don't even know what squash is.
- I don't care what squash is.

08:20.792 --> 08:21.918
Hello?

08:25.364 --> 08:26.797
Yeah. Yeah!

08:28.967 --> 08:30.264
She's gonna kill me.

08:30.735 --> 08:33.363
Yeah, I know.
I think Auggie must have told her.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.832
Hey, I gotta go. Bye.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.706
Thank you, Becca.

08:42.712 --> 08:44.907
I know what this stuff is now.

08:45.015 --> 08:47.916
- I like the way it cracks.
- Of course you do.

08:49.586 --> 08:51.110
So, did you know that woman?

08:51.221 --> 08:53.689
My God, why are you listening
to my phone conversations?

08:53.789 --> 08:58.522
- You're sleeping with the girl's boyfriend.
- It's been over between them!

08:58.627 --> 09:00.151
They're just living together
because of the rent.

09:00.262 --> 09:04.164
- Then why did she accost you?
- Because she's a lunatic.

09:07.001 --> 09:10.164
And Auggie must have told her
that I'm pregnant.

09:12.507 --> 09:14.202
- You are not.
- You're gonna love him.

09:14.309 --> 09:17.472
He's a really...
He's a great guy. He's a musician.

09:18.145 --> 09:20.443
- Well, that's terrific.
- Yeah, he works.

09:20.547 --> 09:23.209
He gets work as a musician.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.651
- How long have you known?
- A few weeks.

09:27.087 --> 09:28.418
Did you tell Mom?

09:29.522 --> 09:31.752
Come on. You told Mom before me?

09:31.857 --> 09:34.348
- I had to.
- Why didn't you tell me?

09:34.460 --> 09:36.485
Why do you think?

09:41.766 --> 09:43.893
I'm sorry, Becca.
I know the timing really sucks.

09:44.002 --> 09:47.699
What are you gonna do?
I'm just glad you finally told me.

10:11.961 --> 10:15.897
Debbie has been driving me crazy
with these kitchen renovations.

10:15.999 --> 10:18.832
I tell you, the countertop negotiations alone.

10:18.934 --> 10:21.630
I told you not to marry an agent.

10:22.704 --> 10:24.968
She still hasn't called, you know.

10:26.274 --> 10:27.605
No, I know.

10:29.643 --> 10:31.770
I mean, I don't mean to be a pest about it,

10:31.879 --> 10:34.507
but I just know Becca
would love to hear from her.

10:34.615 --> 10:36.913
I know. I tell her, Howie, I do.

10:38.919 --> 10:40.546
But she's still...

10:42.655 --> 10:45.988
I don't know. Freaked out, I guess.

10:46.092 --> 10:49.653
- It's been eight months.
- I know. I'll talk to her.

10:49.763 --> 10:53.995
Thank you. Hey, how are the kids?

10:54.466 --> 10:56.297
They're good.

10:56.635 --> 11:00.127
Emily's doing ballet. Robbie is in T-ball.

11:02.775 --> 11:04.003
T-ball.

11:08.046 --> 11:11.573
Hey, have you guys talked at all
about having another?

11:14.852 --> 11:15.841
No.

11:19.856 --> 11:21.721
No, it's a little soon.

11:24.127 --> 11:28.223
- Just be a little open. That's all I'm asking.
- I'm here, aren't I?

11:36.872 --> 11:38.100
- Hey.
- How's it going?

11:38.207 --> 11:40.539
Good, good. We're hanging in there.

11:41.109 --> 11:43.134
- You sure?
- Yeah.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.712
- Hey, Kevin.
- Hi. Hi.

11:45.814 --> 11:47.975
Yeah, we... We just...

11:50.151 --> 11:53.120
We found out
that Becca's sister is pregnant, so...

11:53.220 --> 11:55.279
- Howie.
- What?

11:55.389 --> 11:59.052
That can be hard.
I remember when my cousin got pregnant.

11:59.159 --> 12:01.957
Yeah, it's not really a big deal.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.086
Okay.

12:05.031 --> 12:07.363
If you want to talk about it, though,
you know, the group's here, so...

12:07.467 --> 12:09.526
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

12:10.436 --> 12:13.599
- "Hey, everybody, fresh meat."
- Becca, be nice.

12:13.706 --> 12:15.435
Doesn't she remind you of Lydia?

12:15.541 --> 12:17.975
There was this woman in our group
a couple of years ago.

12:18.076 --> 12:20.772
It was four. Four years ago.

12:20.879 --> 12:23.347
You know,
it doesn't really matter when she was here.

12:23.448 --> 12:26.246
My point is, is that she reminds me of Lydia.

12:27.285 --> 12:30.550
She really wasn't
into the support-group model at first.

12:30.654 --> 12:34.784
- So, how long have you been in group?
- It'll be eight years in June.

12:38.129 --> 12:42.190
I didn't... I didn't realize it was that long.

12:42.632 --> 12:46.363
You know, we're the veterans.
You know, for us it's...

12:46.469 --> 12:51.031
It's a good way to touch base.
Everyone's on a different schedule.

12:51.474 --> 12:53.567
Of course. Of course.

12:57.446 --> 13:01.212
She... You know,
she visits me sometimes in dreams

13:02.417 --> 13:04.385
and she tells me it's okay,

13:05.620 --> 13:10.853
that she's with God.
And we had some good days,

13:13.361 --> 13:18.196
and you think that when you have enough
good days, it actually is gonna get better.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.790
You know, it does get better and then...

13:21.535 --> 13:25.494
- It was her anniversary last week and...
- A year last Tuesday.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.931
And it just starts all over again.

13:32.778 --> 13:35.679
We just have to remind each other that...

13:36.949 --> 13:38.780
- It's just part of God's plan.
- Yeah.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.751
And we can't know why.

13:45.723 --> 13:47.281
You know, only God can know why.

13:49.861 --> 13:53.729
God had to take her.
He needed another angel.

13:54.932 --> 13:56.399
He needed another angel.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.663
Why didn't he just make one?
Another angel.

13:59.770 --> 14:03.069
I mean, he's God, after all.

14:03.173 --> 14:05.767
Why didn't he just make another angel?

14:14.517 --> 14:15.677
Just...

14:19.020 --> 14:21.011
Just putting it out there.

14:25.193 --> 14:26.683
I'd like to go.

14:29.263 --> 14:32.721
I think we're gonna go.
Is that all right, honey?

14:40.273 --> 14:41.570
Excuse us.

14:43.743 --> 14:47.543
They're talking, it's their time,
and you have to respect that.

14:47.647 --> 14:49.478
- Come on.
- I mean, you sit there for weeks

14:49.582 --> 14:50.674
and you don't say a word...

14:50.783 --> 14:53.547
I'm sorry. I can't stand the God freaks.
You know that.

14:53.652 --> 14:55.779
But they're not all like that.
Kevin and Gaby aren't.

14:55.887 --> 14:58.321
No. Kevin and Gaby
are professional wallowers.

14:58.423 --> 15:01.984
I mean, come on. Eight years, Howie. Eight.

15:02.794 --> 15:04.591
If that's what you want to become, then...

15:04.695 --> 15:07.186
- If you want to take a break...
- No, not a break. I'm done.

15:07.865 --> 15:11.858
- I know that Izzy stuff got under your skin.
- Please don't do that. Please.

15:11.969 --> 15:16.599
One semester of psychology 15 years ago
and suddenly you can analyze...

15:16.706 --> 15:17.764
Jesus, Becca.

15:17.874 --> 15:19.501
I don't like the group.

15:19.609 --> 15:22.737
- I gave it a try. It's not for me.
- Okay.

15:23.647 --> 15:25.239
It's not for you.

15:26.283 --> 15:27.580
Thank you.

15:30.219 --> 15:35.316
Do you mind if we not eat here,
'cause nothing's really jumping out at me.

17:01.036 --> 17:05.233
Taz! Stop, stop. Come here and eat.
Come on. Come on.

17:06.640 --> 17:10.598
Stay. Sorry, he's not really dangerous. Eat.

17:10.711 --> 17:11.905
- Yeah.
- He's just kind of dumb.

17:12.012 --> 17:13.945
No, I know. He's my dog.

17:16.516 --> 17:18.244
You're Becca.

17:18.351 --> 17:21.377
I should have recognized you, of course.
I'm Auggie.

17:23.223 --> 17:24.588
- Hi, Auggie.
- Hi.

17:24.691 --> 17:26.386
Oh, my God!

17:26.492 --> 17:28.791
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming over?

17:28.894 --> 17:31.158
I would have picked up the house.

17:31.263 --> 17:34.494
- That's Auggie.
- Yeah, we met. Is Izzy here?

17:34.600 --> 17:37.330
Yeah, she's here.
She got fired from Applebee's.

17:39.470 --> 17:42.098
I was planning on taking
it all down to Goodwill,

17:42.206 --> 17:46.939
but now I'm glad that I didn't,
because look at these shirts.

17:47.044 --> 17:48.068
Look at them. And these sweaters...

17:48.179 --> 17:50.807
I don't know, Becca.
I mean, they're in baby clothes for so long.

17:50.914 --> 17:53.314
It'll probably be a while
before he can even fit into that stuff.

17:53.417 --> 17:57.376
No. It comes up very quickly, you'll see.
You're gonna be happy that I saved it.

17:58.054 --> 18:01.615
- Is he living here?
- He has to. His girlfriend kicked him out.

18:01.725 --> 18:04.250
- Ex-girlfriend.
- She knows what I meant.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.796
- Did you see this one?
- That's cute. Look at that.

18:08.564 --> 18:10.088
What if it's a girl?

18:10.199 --> 18:12.997
Well, then...
I don't know, I'll give it to someone else.

18:13.102 --> 18:14.330
But you're gonna... You're gonna thank me.

18:14.437 --> 18:16.496
There's a couple of years' worth
of clothes here.

18:16.604 --> 18:18.162
Think of all the money you're gonna save.

18:18.273 --> 18:21.208
- It's not about the money.
- Well, it should be.

18:21.309 --> 18:24.870
Come on, Izzy.
You gotta start thinking about that.

18:24.979 --> 18:29.712
I mean, especially if the dad's a musician.
It costs a lot to raise a child, I'm telling you.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.411
It would just be weird, Becca,

18:32.519 --> 18:35.784
if it was a boy, to see him running around
in Danny's clothes.

18:36.223 --> 18:38.589
I would just feel weird about it.

18:43.930 --> 18:44.897
Yeah.

18:47.233 --> 18:52.000
- I'm sorry. Of course it would be weird.
- It was a nice offer.

18:52.103 --> 18:55.630
You're gonna get a lot of clothes.
Christmas, birthdays.

18:55.740 --> 18:58.300
- You don't have anything to worry about.
- It's probably a girl, anyway.

18:58.410 --> 19:00.537
You know,
I'm a little psychic about these things.

19:00.645 --> 19:05.378
Remember, I said Sheila was having a girl?
And Karin!

19:05.483 --> 19:10.284
- I think there's a girl in there.
- I hope there is. I mean, I want a girl.

19:10.387 --> 19:13.788
I want it to be healthy, obviously,
but I really hope it's a girl.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.085
Me, too.

19:16.259 --> 19:18.591
You want some coffee cake?
I've got some coffee cake for us.

19:18.695 --> 19:20.128
I'm actually gonna take off

19:20.230 --> 19:23.927
because I promised Howie
that I'd pick up some dinner.

19:24.033 --> 19:25.728
Looks good, though.

19:30.272 --> 19:32.672
Here. Eat some cake.

21:39.223 --> 21:43.751
- When did Rick ever beat me at squash?
- Did he mention Debbie at all?

21:45.463 --> 21:48.489
You can call her, you know.
Get the reports directly.

21:48.599 --> 21:51.796
I don't want to call her. She should call me.

21:53.770 --> 21:57.900
I would have been there for her if anything
had ever happened to Robbie or Em.

22:01.844 --> 22:04.369
I wouldn't have vanished the way she did.

22:07.750 --> 22:08.717
I wouldn't.

22:10.419 --> 22:11.545
Howie?

22:13.721 --> 22:15.484
You know what I mean?

22:25.799 --> 22:27.630
Yeah.

22:47.687 --> 22:48.813
Howie.

22:54.359 --> 22:55.724
Turn around.

22:58.129 --> 23:01.394
Come on. You need to relax.

23:15.778 --> 23:19.043
- Your shoulders are all knotted up.
- Yeah.

23:20.083 --> 23:21.141
Yeah.

23:22.685 --> 23:24.414
Forget about Debbie

23:26.254 --> 23:28.518
and whatever else is bothering you.

23:32.260 --> 23:35.787
I know what this is. Dimming the lights...

23:36.765 --> 23:39.359
You're trying to seduce me.

23:39.467 --> 23:43.028
You're plying me with... With liquor.

23:43.137 --> 23:44.570
It worked in college.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.939
That's enough. That's enough.

23:56.382 --> 23:57.679
Where are you going?

23:57.784 --> 24:01.982
No, I just... I'm feeling antsy tonight.
I'm sorry. It just... It was a weird day.

24:04.757 --> 24:07.726
- Right.
- What, now you're gonna pout?

24:08.427 --> 24:10.952
- It's been eight months.
- But who's keeping track?

24:11.063 --> 24:12.587
I am. I'm keeping track.

24:13.731 --> 24:17.167
I'm not ready yet, Howie. All right? I'm just...

24:19.971 --> 24:22.098
I'm sorry if you think that that's abnormal.

24:22.206 --> 24:24.140
I don't.
I don't think it's abnormal at all, but...

24:24.242 --> 24:25.300
So, what's the problem?

24:25.408 --> 24:28.536
We need to at least head in that direction,
which might feel strange at first, but...

24:28.645 --> 24:31.045
- But you want to have sex.
- Don't say it like that.

24:31.148 --> 24:35.141
- You're trying to rope me into having sex.
- I am not. I wasn't roping you into sex.

24:35.252 --> 24:36.879
- AI Green isn't roping?
- No.

24:36.986 --> 24:39.853
- AI Green?
- I thought it was nice. That's all.

24:40.489 --> 24:41.956
I was trying to make things nice.

24:42.057 --> 24:45.993
You can't. You just can't, all right?

24:46.095 --> 24:49.326
I'm sorry. Things aren't nice anymore.

24:56.671 --> 24:58.764
Babe, will you hold him for a second?
Just hold him like that.

24:58.873 --> 25:01.341
- Taz, quit it.
- Yeah, tell Taz to quit it.

25:01.441 --> 25:04.137
- All right. Now...
- 'Cause Taz wants to go on the tire.

25:04.244 --> 25:08.977
- Hold on. Let me see Mama and...
- Okay, you ready? I'm gonna let you go.

25:09.082 --> 25:10.276
- Ready?
- Yes.

25:10.384 --> 25:13.353
Here it goes. There!

25:13.452 --> 25:15.283
- Keep your feet up.
- Danny.

25:15.788 --> 25:17.653
- Look at me on the way back, Danny.
- Keep your feet up, Danny.

25:42.713 --> 25:43.737
Hey.

25:46.817 --> 25:50.480
If you're not gonna go to group,
I need you to see someone.

26:02.064 --> 26:05.124
- Any plans for the day?
- You're looking at them.

26:08.237 --> 26:10.330
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

27:18.968 --> 27:22.062
I'm here to see Scott Baiter
in the Events department.

27:23.839 --> 27:25.966
I don't have a Baiter listed.

27:27.642 --> 27:29.075
That's weird.

27:31.313 --> 27:35.841
- Kate Finn. What about Kate?
- I have a Robert Finn in Dec Arts.

27:37.918 --> 27:40.648
If you have an appointment,
I can just call up there.

27:40.754 --> 27:42.119
Who are you?

27:44.258 --> 27:49.127
I... I don't have an appointment. I...
I'm an old friend. I used to work here.

27:49.228 --> 27:50.456
Becca?

27:53.566 --> 27:56.364
- Gary!
- Hey! What are you doing here?

27:57.370 --> 28:00.237
I had some errands to run in the city and I...

28:00.339 --> 28:03.638
I thought I'd pop in and say hello,
but apparently nobody works here anymore.

28:03.742 --> 28:08.543
Yeah, no, Scott went over to Christie's
back in March. Traitor.

28:08.981 --> 28:11.575
It's good to see
you're still doing the coffee runs, though.

28:11.682 --> 28:15.743
No. No, no, no. I don't usually.
I'm in Scott's old job.

28:18.322 --> 28:22.224
- Hey, how's the family?
- You know what, Gary, I...

28:23.527 --> 28:27.122
I know how busy it gets up there,
so I'm gonna let you get back to it.

28:27.230 --> 28:28.527
Yeah, that hasn't changed.

28:28.631 --> 28:30.622
- It was great to see you, though.
- You, too.

29:23.282 --> 29:25.876
- There are fines, you know?
- No, I know.

29:25.984 --> 29:29.317
The book's quite overdue.
We sent out several notices.

29:29.421 --> 29:32.015
- Yeah, that's why I'm here.
- $7.00.

29:37.194 --> 29:38.491
Thank you.

29:52.775 --> 29:54.675
Can I help you?

29:55.678 --> 29:59.637
Yeah, actually. Would it be possible
for me to check this out?

30:01.083 --> 30:02.380
Certainly.

30:09.858 --> 30:15.194
"'I will become a fish in a trout stream
and I will swim away from you."'

30:15.296 --> 30:18.163
- He's an iguana.
- Yeah, he is.

30:18.365 --> 30:22.734
"'Lf you become a fish in a trout stream,'
said his mother,

30:22.837 --> 30:25.772
"'I will become a fisherman
and I will fish for you..."'

30:25.872 --> 30:26.839
Sorry.

30:27.740 --> 30:29.640
What do you think's gonna happen?

30:29.742 --> 30:31.141
- I don't know.
- Let's see.

30:31.244 --> 30:32.506
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:32.946 --> 30:37.178
I just scored Yankee tickets off of Rowan.
Tonight. You interested?

30:38.684 --> 30:42.085
- I can't. I got group.
- You can't skip one night?

30:43.055 --> 30:45.387
They're right behind home plate.

30:46.458 --> 30:49.518
- Another time.
- If there is one.

30:54.665 --> 30:57.099
- You going stag tonight?
- Yeah.

30:57.201 --> 31:00.500
No. Becca, she's...
She's gonna take a little break.

31:02.139 --> 31:03.629
From the group.

31:05.041 --> 31:06.906
I'm gonna get a coffee.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.575
- Want to sit?
- Yeah.

31:19.622 --> 31:22.147
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom. It's me.

31:22.258 --> 31:24.055
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

31:24.859 --> 31:28.556
I was thinking about making
Izzy's birthday cake. Would that be all right?

31:28.663 --> 31:30.528
Honey, you don't have to do all that.

31:30.632 --> 31:34.033
I was just gonna grab her
one of those Carvel things. She likes those.

31:34.135 --> 31:38.435
I don't mind. I really don't.
I mean, it will give me something to do.

31:38.539 --> 31:39.904
Okay, okay.

31:40.574 --> 31:42.508
No group tonight?

31:42.609 --> 31:46.101
Howie's there. It's too much God talk for me.

31:50.416 --> 31:52.748
- What?
- Nothing. It's just that...

31:53.553 --> 31:55.885
You know,
some people find that comforting.

31:55.988 --> 31:57.751
Yeah, well, it pisses me off.

31:57.857 --> 32:01.725
You know, Becca, when your brother died,
I found the church very helpful.

32:01.826 --> 32:06.160
I know. I know you did, but that's you.
That's not me, and Danny...

32:07.032 --> 32:08.260
Danny isn't Arthur.

32:08.366 --> 32:10.527
You know,
I brought you to church every Sunday.

32:10.634 --> 32:13.262
Let's not start this again, okay, Mom?

32:13.837 --> 32:17.534
I'm just... I'm just calling about the cake.

32:17.641 --> 32:20.041
You're not right about everything,
you know?

32:20.277 --> 32:24.270
- What if there is a God?
- Then I'd say he's a sadistic prick.

32:24.380 --> 32:28.840
- All right, Becca, that's enough.
- "Worship me and I'll treat you like shit."

32:30.653 --> 32:33.019
No wonder you like him.
He sounds just like Dad.

32:38.927 --> 32:40.224
I'm sorry.

32:43.565 --> 32:45.556
You're gonna do the cake, then?

32:46.301 --> 32:47.325
Yeah.

32:50.171 --> 32:52.537
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

32:55.977 --> 32:58.741
Who has a birthday party
in a bowling alley, anyway?

32:58.845 --> 33:01.177
I mean, Izzy thinks she's still 14.

33:01.448 --> 33:03.973
If you're not up for this, we don't have to go.

33:04.084 --> 33:06.575
No, it's just a party. I'm fine.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.751
I wish you'd take that thing out of here.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.826
We're hardly in this car.
What's the difference?

33:17.930 --> 33:20.660
It's weird. It feels weird.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.803
What if we gave it another try?

33:27.005 --> 33:29.132
- What?
- Another baby?

33:29.674 --> 33:30.936
I mean, we're not getting any younger.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.873
Is that what the sex thing
was about the other night?

33:32.977 --> 33:35.309
- No.
- You're trying to get me pregnant.

33:35.412 --> 33:37.209
Becca, no, of course not.

33:38.815 --> 33:41.545
I know it's scary, but maybe it might

33:42.486 --> 33:45.114
- help us get back on track.
- On track?

33:45.222 --> 33:47.383
What, we can't talk about it?

33:49.258 --> 33:50.850
I think we should sell the house.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.190
I've been thinking about it,
and since we're on the topic...

33:53.296 --> 33:55.230
What? What do you mean?
How are we on the topic?

33:55.331 --> 33:57.322
I talked to a realtor,
and she thinks we can pull together...

33:57.433 --> 34:00.527
- What do you mean, talked to a realtor?
...an open house pretty quickly, and then...

34:00.635 --> 34:02.933
Why would you talk to a realtor
without telling me?

34:03.038 --> 34:05.006
I'm telling you now.

34:05.106 --> 34:08.199
You want us to get back on track,
I think it would help if we moved.

34:08.310 --> 34:10.540
- We love that house.
- He's everywhere, Howie.

34:10.643 --> 34:12.578
I can see his fingerprints on the door jams.

34:12.679 --> 34:14.875
- I see puzzles, I see his highchair.
- I like seeing his fingerprints.

34:14.982 --> 34:17.280
Yeah, but that's because you don't have
to sit and stare at it all day.

34:17.384 --> 34:18.873
You get to go to work. You get to escape.

34:18.985 --> 34:20.954
- Yeah, but I don't want to move!
- I don't want another baby!

34:21.822 --> 34:22.846
Jesus!

34:29.161 --> 34:30.629
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

34:30.730 --> 34:33.858
I just had to check the cake. It's fine.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.998
Are you kidding? The Kennedys?

34:41.106 --> 34:42.971
With the assassinations
and the lobotomies?

34:43.074 --> 34:44.167
- Yeah.
- Right here.

34:44.275 --> 34:47.438
Yeah. That's not a curse, though.

34:48.079 --> 34:50.946
- It's just bad luck.
- The plane crashes?

34:51.047 --> 34:53.641
Too much money. That's their curse.

34:54.652 --> 34:58.884
If those Kennedys lived like normal people,
most of them would still be alive.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.716
I think it's sad.

35:00.824 --> 35:04.385
All those good-looking people
falling out of the sky like that.

35:04.761 --> 35:06.422
It's a frigging waste.

35:06.663 --> 35:09.257
- Didn't I say no wine?
- She brought it herself.

35:09.599 --> 35:13.262
Isn't this nice?
Just sitting around talking politics like this?

35:13.369 --> 35:15.428
I never do this. It's a nice change.

35:16.138 --> 35:17.469
- Let's do gifts.
- Yes.

35:17.606 --> 35:19.267
- Yeah, gifts!
- All right!

35:19.742 --> 35:21.073
- Yes!
- Okay.

35:21.809 --> 35:26.542
- It's heavy.
- So pretty. I hate to ruin it, but I will.

35:30.451 --> 35:31.850
It's a bathroom set.

35:33.620 --> 35:35.679
More of a practical gift.

35:35.789 --> 35:40.351
Is this your way of telling me you don't like
my Three Stooges shower curtain?

35:41.061 --> 35:44.462
- I didn't know what to get you, so...
- Seriously, it's great.

35:44.564 --> 35:47.829
- Say thank you.
- Thank you, Becca. Thank you, Howie.

35:47.933 --> 35:51.767
- Don't thank me, Becca picked it out.
- Now me.

35:53.205 --> 35:56.663
- Thank you.
- I know it's a little early, but...

35:57.276 --> 36:00.575
- Oh, my God!
- Lovely.

36:00.945 --> 36:03.641
So sweet. Thank you, Mama.

36:06.751 --> 36:09.515
I thought we weren't doing baby stuff
for the birthday.

36:09.620 --> 36:12.817
I thought we were doing it...
We were waiting for the shower.

36:12.923 --> 36:15.619
No, honey, it's not baby stuff,
it's mommy stuff.

36:15.726 --> 36:18.456
This is perfect, Bec.
I needed a bathroom set.

36:18.562 --> 36:22.157
- Yeah, but you need baby stuff more.
- We can take it back.

36:22.265 --> 36:23.857
- That's right, we should.
- No.

36:23.966 --> 36:25.991
I'm gonna get you a basket
of Mustela lotions.

36:26.102 --> 36:27.831
- They prevent stretch marks.
- No. Becca, let it go.

36:27.937 --> 36:29.632
You can get me the lotion another time.

36:29.739 --> 36:33.402
- No, come on.
- You can get me the lotion another time!

36:33.508 --> 36:36.443
I got it, I got it. It's okay. It's all right.

36:36.645 --> 36:39.239
- I didn't...
- Thank you. Thank you, Becca.

36:45.020 --> 36:46.078
Here.

36:53.961 --> 36:57.522
I just remembered what I was gonna say
about Aristotle Onassis.

36:57.630 --> 37:01.964
It was about the son
who died in a plane crash.

37:02.068 --> 37:03.057
Are you ready to go?

37:03.169 --> 37:04.761
You should have stopped him
from going off

37:04.871 --> 37:08.898
on all that Kennedy stuff,
because my point was Onassis

37:09.008 --> 37:12.375
and how he put up a reward
to anyone who could prove

37:12.478 --> 37:15.572
that someone had sabotaged
his son's plane.

37:15.681 --> 37:19.549
He was so desperate to blame somebody.
Did you read this?

37:22.887 --> 37:26.880
- He needed a reason for losing his son.
- Mom, why are you telling this story?

37:27.792 --> 37:30.989
- I'm just talking. I can't talk?
- You never just talk.

37:31.095 --> 37:34.087
You guys, thanks for coming to my party.
Becca, the cake was so good.

37:34.197 --> 37:36.893
You forget what I went through
when your brother died.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.264
You think I don't know anything,
but I do, Becca.

37:39.369 --> 37:42.736
- Like who to blame?
- Guys, please. It's my birthday party.

37:42.839 --> 37:46.570
- No, let it go. That's their stuff.
- No, I'm not talking about blame.

37:46.675 --> 37:48.836
- I'm talking about comfort.
- Comfort.

37:48.944 --> 37:51.174
- Where are you getting it?
- Comfort? I'm not.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.247
Well, I think you should.

37:52.348 --> 37:55.249
Okay, well, let me get on that
and see what I can dig up on eBay.

37:55.351 --> 37:57.876
I'm just trying to help you, Becca.

37:57.986 --> 38:01.114
You know, I wish somebody had given me
a little advice when Arthur died.

38:01.222 --> 38:02.211
You know what I wish?

38:02.323 --> 38:04.848
I wish you would stop comparing Danny
to Arthur.

38:04.959 --> 38:06.392
- Becca.
- Danny was a 4-year-old boy

38:06.494 --> 38:08.018
who chased his dog into the street,

38:08.162 --> 38:12.064
and Arthur was a 30-year-old heroin addict
who OD'd.

38:12.165 --> 38:15.464
Frankly, I resent
how you keep lumping them together, Mom.

38:15.569 --> 38:17.560
He was still my son.

38:29.048 --> 38:31.949
We're gonna go.
I hope you enjoy the bathroom set, Izzy.

38:32.051 --> 38:33.018
I'm gonna.

38:44.662 --> 38:47.460
When Arthur died
I was just as upset as she was,

38:47.565 --> 38:50.625
but I didn't take it out on other people.

38:51.535 --> 38:54.060
What about Mrs. Bailey?

38:54.939 --> 38:57.635
Nobody's talking about Mrs. Bailey.

39:26.634 --> 39:30.832
- Hey, did you call that guy about the roof?
- No, I couldn't find the number.

39:31.739 --> 39:35.334
Becca, it's in my phone. It's on the mantle.

39:38.445 --> 39:40.003
What's his name?

39:42.415 --> 39:44.542
It's not under his name.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.885
Then how am I supposed to call him if I...

39:47.987 --> 39:50.478
- It's under "roof guy."
- "Roof guy."

39:52.691 --> 39:58.061
- Well, what was I supposed to put it under?
- I don't know how to use this.

40:01.132 --> 40:05.694
- It doesn't...
- No. Okay, now scroll down.

40:05.803 --> 40:09.068
- Now what? You do it.
- Scroll down with your finger.

40:12.876 --> 40:15.436
- Roof guy.
- Thank you.

40:15.545 --> 40:17.035
You're welcome.

40:34.262 --> 40:36.127
Are you waiting for me?

40:38.266 --> 40:42.760
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
I thought that you took the bus.

40:44.405 --> 40:46.396
- I do.
- But not today.

40:47.608 --> 40:49.508
Not today. I skipped school.

40:50.678 --> 40:53.442
Well, you shouldn't be playing hooky,
young man.

40:58.184 --> 41:00.345
Why are you waiting for me?

41:03.022 --> 41:04.956
I thought we could talk.

41:06.392 --> 41:07.916
About what?

41:12.464 --> 41:16.025
- Is this okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

41:17.836 --> 41:19.804
- Not too weird?
- No.

41:22.306 --> 41:23.534
I mean...

41:25.309 --> 41:27.004
No, I know, it's...

41:28.612 --> 41:30.477
It's weird for me, too.

41:33.783 --> 41:37.014
- Don't you like school?
- I like it all right.

41:37.687 --> 41:41.350
I just thought 'cause you...
I don't know, you seem to not be going, so...

41:41.458 --> 41:44.791
I've been accepted to college already, so...

41:45.461 --> 41:49.022
- Not a big deal, then.
- No, it is a big deal,

41:49.131 --> 41:51.565
but only if my mother finds out.

41:52.501 --> 41:56.130
She said she would confiscate my phone
if I did it again.

41:56.237 --> 41:58.569
Not that I use my phone anyway.

41:58.673 --> 42:00.834
- So, where are you headed?
- Connecticut College.

42:00.942 --> 42:04.036
Right. That's a good school. Not far.

42:05.713 --> 42:09.774
I bet your parents are pleased
that you're gonna be close by.

42:09.883 --> 42:13.284
It's just my mom, but, yeah,
she's pretty happy about it.

42:13.386 --> 42:15.217
She keeps saying she's gonna apply
to the grad program

42:15.322 --> 42:17.552
so she can keep an eye on me
while I'm up there.

42:18.058 --> 42:21.494
- She's just joking, though.
- Yeah.

42:21.594 --> 42:24.222
She's not really looking forward to it,
'cause I'm the only one at home now,

42:24.330 --> 42:28.460
but I told her I'd come home
on the weekends and stuff if I could.

42:30.136 --> 42:31.967
Well, that'll be nice.

42:38.943 --> 42:40.001
So...

42:42.947 --> 42:44.244
I'm sorry.

42:46.416 --> 42:47.576
I know.

42:50.020 --> 42:52.011
- You don't have to...
- I know that doesn't help.

42:52.122 --> 42:54.317
No, it does, it really does, but...

42:54.424 --> 42:56.915
- I know I should have tried to get in touch...
- It's fine.

42:59.395 --> 43:03.331
I just really wish I had driven down
a different block that day.

43:05.134 --> 43:06.294
I know.

43:13.074 --> 43:15.065
You know, I should maybe go.

43:16.211 --> 43:17.200
It's all right.

43:17.312 --> 43:21.214
No, I gotta... My mom's gonna start
to wonder where I'm at.

43:21.649 --> 43:24.243
It's okay. You really don't have to. It's...

43:27.555 --> 43:29.989
Can we do this again sometime?

43:33.026 --> 43:34.425
Sure.

43:35.195 --> 43:36.253
Okay.

44:15.632 --> 44:16.997
Jesus Christ.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.692
- Hey, Gaby.
- I can't... I know.

44:18.802 --> 44:20.861
God, I can't believe you just saw me do that.

44:21.670 --> 44:23.160
I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

44:23.272 --> 44:28.505
I thought something was wrong,
but, obviously, everything smells fine.

44:28.611 --> 44:31.978
You can smell it, huh? God.

44:34.716 --> 44:37.014
- Everyone in there's gonna know.
- Nah.

44:37.118 --> 44:40.110
- I swear I never do this.
- Where's Kevin?

44:42.090 --> 44:43.751
He's not coming to group.

44:43.857 --> 44:48.021
And I blame your wife, by the way,
'cause I think she put the idea in his head.

44:48.362 --> 44:50.853
Yeah, well, he didn't really seem
to like group all that much.

44:51.598 --> 44:56.160
God, you know, he's got me so upset.
I mean, like, look at me. I'm... I'm...

44:57.904 --> 45:00.930
I am smoking pot in a parking lot.

45:01.040 --> 45:03.736
It's like I'm in high school. It's...
I'm ridiculous.

45:03.843 --> 45:05.606
You got any more?

45:08.580 --> 45:09.638
Yeah.

45:10.882 --> 45:12.611
Come on in, partner.

45:14.586 --> 45:16.645
Well, if today is rage day,

45:19.957 --> 45:24.724
most of you know that I'm a little bit
more comfortable with rage,

45:24.828 --> 45:26.523
talking about rage.

45:28.465 --> 45:30.797
I deal with rage every single day.

45:31.868 --> 45:35.429
I listen to guys at work going on and on

45:38.708 --> 45:43.805
about paving their driveways or whatever.
Stupid nonsense.

45:44.947 --> 45:50.783
They don't know.
They haven't had their lives ripped apart yet.

45:51.320 --> 45:53.652
- They're not in the club.
- Exactly.

45:54.356 --> 45:56.483
Meanwhile, I'm like,

45:57.024 --> 46:01.154
"Hey, guys, my daughter died of leukemia."

46:04.565 --> 46:06.999
I'm sorry. I have to get some water.

46:14.574 --> 46:18.374
You're one of those bad kids
my mother warned me about.

46:18.477 --> 46:23.278
Yes, yeah, I am corrupting you.
But don't worry, I won't tell Becca.

46:23.849 --> 46:25.578
I'd appreciate that.

46:27.353 --> 46:28.945
- Bye.
- Good night.

46:39.731 --> 46:40.959
Becca?

46:42.166 --> 46:44.794
- Becca? What'd you do here?
- What?

46:45.235 --> 46:47.169
- God damn it.
- What?

46:47.270 --> 46:50.865
- What'd you do to my phone?
- Jesus, Howie, I thought something had...

46:50.974 --> 46:54.034
This morning, when you used it,
what did you do to my phone?

46:54.144 --> 46:55.270
Nothing, I just...

46:55.378 --> 46:57.903
- I just got the number for the roof guy.
- For God's sake.

46:58.014 --> 47:00.778
- What? You told me to call him.
- You deleted Danny's video.

47:02.118 --> 47:03.710
No. No, I didn't. No.

47:03.819 --> 47:06.549
I just... You were right there.
I just got the number.

47:06.654 --> 47:09.088
Yeah, and you kept pressing the screen.

47:09.190 --> 47:11.215
Because I couldn't figure out
how to use your phone.

47:11.326 --> 47:13.794
- I checked already, it's gone.
- We have 100 videos of him.

47:13.895 --> 47:15.328
That's not the point, Becca.

47:15.430 --> 47:17.261
Then... Then you should
have put it on your computer.

47:17.365 --> 47:20.892
- Right, right, it's my fault.
- I didn't say that.

47:21.502 --> 47:24.699
- I said it's gone!
- Jesus, Howie! I didn't do it on purpose!

47:24.805 --> 47:27.365
- Are you sure?
- What does that mean?

47:27.474 --> 47:29.635
What, you think I deliberately
deleted his video?

47:29.743 --> 47:30.937
I don't know.

47:31.811 --> 47:35.144
- You don't know?
- It's like you're trying to get rid of him.

47:35.248 --> 47:38.115
I'm sorry, but that's how it feels.
Every day it's something new.

47:38.217 --> 47:39.377
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:39.485 --> 47:42.454
It's like you're trying to get rid
of any evidence he was ever here.

47:43.522 --> 47:45.683
- What? You took the paintings off the fridge.
- To save them.

47:46.158 --> 47:49.127
- To save them. They are in a box downstairs.
- Okay, his clothes.

47:49.227 --> 47:51.559
We don't need all that stuff, Howie.
We just don't.

47:51.663 --> 47:54.427
You wanting to sell the house.
Your sending Taz to your mother's.

47:54.532 --> 47:56.523
There's a lot going on.
The dog got underfoot.

47:56.634 --> 47:59.569
- Right. And he was a reminder.
- Yes, yes, he is a reminder.

47:59.670 --> 48:03.003
- And since you never wanted the dog...
- I wanted one less reminder. For God's sake.

48:03.107 --> 48:05.667
If I hadn't bought the dog,
Danny would still be alive.

48:05.776 --> 48:09.542
If I hadn't have run back in to get the phone,
if I had latched that gate...

48:09.646 --> 48:10.874
I left the gate unlatched!

48:10.980 --> 48:14.347
Come on, I'm not playing this game again,
Howie, I'm not!

48:14.451 --> 48:17.477
- It's no one's fault, and I'm not...
- Not even the dog's!

48:17.587 --> 48:20.021
Dogs chase squirrels! Boys chase dogs!

48:20.122 --> 48:22.852
- I know that.
- He loved that dog and you got rid of it!

48:22.958 --> 48:24.482
Just like I'm getting rid of the video, huh?

48:24.593 --> 48:27.721
It's not about the video, Becca.
It's not about the video!

48:27.830 --> 48:30.196
It's not just the video,
it's about Taz and the paintings

48:30.298 --> 48:33.563
and his clothes and everything!
There's no pictures of him around!

48:33.668 --> 48:36.466
There's no fingerprints! There's nothing!
God damn it!

48:37.705 --> 48:40.606
You have to stop erasing him!
You have to stop it!

48:40.708 --> 48:45.111
Do you really think that I don't see him
every second of every day?

48:47.114 --> 48:51.016
The video was an accident, Howie,
and believe me,

48:51.118 --> 48:53.484
I will beat myself up about it forever,
I'm sure,

48:53.587 --> 48:55.214
just like everything else
I could have prevented.

48:55.321 --> 48:58.415
- That's not what I want, Becca.
- No? Because it feels like it is.

48:58.524 --> 49:01.618
It feels like maybe
I don't feel badly enough for you.

49:01.727 --> 49:05.163
Maybe I'm not feeling enough.
What do you want from me?

49:09.567 --> 49:13.003
Something's got to change, because this...

49:14.706 --> 49:17.436
I can't do this like this anymore. It's...

49:19.877 --> 49:23.176
It's too hard. It's too hard.

49:26.750 --> 49:28.877
And I want that dog back.

49:29.819 --> 49:32.379
- Your mother's making him fat.
- Howie.

49:34.223 --> 49:39.820
I miss the dog.
I'm sorry, but I miss him. I want him back.

50:10.557 --> 50:12.991
- Did you really make these?
- I did.

50:14.894 --> 50:16.259
That's good.

50:18.931 --> 50:21.832
- They're still warm.
- I'm glad you like them.

50:30.074 --> 50:33.874
I've been reading that book,
the parallel universe book.

50:34.879 --> 50:38.178
Yeah? Did you like it?

50:38.282 --> 50:42.651
Yeah. It's interesting. I don't know if I buy it,

50:43.920 --> 50:47.981
the whole alternate reality thing, I just...
I don't know.

50:49.259 --> 50:50.590
But it's interesting.

50:52.095 --> 50:56.054
- Did you have to do it for a school project?
- No, it's research.

50:58.901 --> 51:00.129
Research?

51:09.110 --> 51:10.737
It's a comic book.

51:13.081 --> 51:14.514
It's impressive.

51:15.250 --> 51:16.683
- Did you do all of this?
- Yeah.

51:18.218 --> 51:20.118
Wow. It's amazing.

51:21.788 --> 51:26.191
- What's it about?
- A scientist, I guess, and his son. The...

51:27.394 --> 51:32.388
The father discovers this network of holes
that leads to other galaxies and...

51:32.498 --> 51:37.993
- Parallel universes.
- Yeah, and, well, the scientist dies,

51:38.104 --> 51:42.438
so the son has to go into this rabbit hole

51:42.540 --> 51:46.840
to try and find him,
but it's not him because he's dead,

51:46.945 --> 51:49.846
so it's, like, another version of him.

51:57.988 --> 51:59.421
It's kind of stupid.

51:59.957 --> 52:01.686
- No.
- No? Okay.

52:02.793 --> 52:05.284
Not at all. I would love to read it.

52:08.331 --> 52:14.395
Yeah, it's... Sorry. It's not...
It's not done yet, but when it is done, I will...

52:15.038 --> 52:16.027
I will let you read it.

52:16.139 --> 52:17.128
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:24.980 --> 52:27.574
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

52:27.983 --> 52:29.450
I... I...

52:29.550 --> 52:31.814
I might have been going too fast

52:33.087 --> 52:34.452
on that day.

52:36.924 --> 52:38.221
I mean, I'm not sure, but I might have been,

52:38.326 --> 52:40.658
so that's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

52:43.863 --> 52:48.232
It's a 30 zone,
and I might have been going 31 or 32.

52:50.136 --> 52:53.264
I usually look down and check,
and if I'm going over

52:53.372 --> 52:54.737
then I would slow down, obviously,

52:54.840 --> 52:57.934
but I don't remember checking
on your block.

52:59.611 --> 53:04.378
So, it's possible
that I was going too fast and...

53:08.786 --> 53:13.314
And... Well, the dog ran out really fast,
you know?

53:13.424 --> 53:16.393
So I swerved. I didn't know.

53:17.894 --> 53:19.361
I didn't know.

53:23.734 --> 53:25.702
I thought you should know,

53:27.070 --> 53:30.096
I might have been going
a little over the limit,

53:31.707 --> 53:32.901
and I can't be positive.

53:36.345 --> 53:37.710
- Okay.
- Okay.

53:38.647 --> 53:39.705
Yeah.

53:41.349 --> 53:42.407
All right.

53:43.651 --> 53:45.312
Okay.

53:47.489 --> 53:48.786
Thank you.

54:20.685 --> 54:22.778
I don't want to go in there.

54:28.759 --> 54:30.226
Yes, yes, yes!

54:39.870 --> 54:42.304
- I'm sorry. It was...
- Be nice.

54:53.916 --> 54:55.474
- My God.
- Come on.

54:55.584 --> 54:57.848
- I'm sorry, you suck.
- I would be doing better,

54:57.953 --> 55:01.855
but your pot messed up
my depth perception.

55:05.359 --> 55:06.792
- All right.
- Yeah.

55:06.894 --> 55:09.385
I'm gonna support that one.
I'm totally gonna support that one.

55:09.497 --> 55:10.794
Thank you.

55:12.767 --> 55:15.099
Hey. You know what?
I have a confession to make.

55:15.203 --> 55:19.606
- Remember when I said Kevin left group?
- Yeah.

55:21.775 --> 55:23.640
What I meant to say was

55:25.979 --> 55:27.310
he left me.

55:30.683 --> 55:32.014
He left me.

55:36.422 --> 55:37.719
Yeah, I...

55:39.758 --> 55:41.589
I came home and he was gone.

55:43.194 --> 55:47.858
- God, no note or...
- No. God, there was a note. Well, not...

55:48.399 --> 55:51.630
Not a note so much as a manifesto

55:53.370 --> 55:57.170
on all the ways
that we were destroying each other.

55:58.909 --> 56:00.376
I'm sorry.

56:01.578 --> 56:04.547
I mean, this is how it generally goes, right?

56:06.249 --> 56:10.413
It changes you. It literally changes people.

56:12.655 --> 56:16.113
You know,
a part of me thinks it was inevitable.

56:21.062 --> 56:22.552
I love my wife.

56:26.034 --> 56:27.626
Of course you do.

56:29.003 --> 56:30.766
I love her very much.

56:33.307 --> 56:34.365
Okay.

56:52.758 --> 56:55.556
I... I think you're right. We should maybe

56:57.563 --> 56:59.656
look into selling the house.

57:01.400 --> 57:03.834
It's probably for the best.

57:04.468 --> 57:05.526
Okay.

57:28.991 --> 57:33.519
Don't do that. Quick as a Band-Aid
or we'll never get through this. Here.

57:38.367 --> 57:41.427
Hi, kids.
Welcome to the light-up alphabet apple.

57:41.536 --> 57:43.663
- Hi, kids...
- I don't know how to turn it off.

57:43.771 --> 57:45.898
Only people without children
give gifts like this.

57:46.007 --> 57:48.771
- Come on. Come on. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

57:48.876 --> 57:51.140
I hope you'll visit again soon.

57:54.448 --> 57:57.508
- So, have you heard from Debbie yet?
- Nope.

57:57.618 --> 57:59.518
That's too bad.

57:59.620 --> 58:04.717
Although, it can be worse the other way.
You know, I remember when Arthur died...

58:04.824 --> 58:06.121
You can say his name.

58:06.559 --> 58:08.493
- Can I?
- Yes.

58:08.594 --> 58:11.392
You know, I don't know your rules.
I don't want to get scolded again.

58:11.497 --> 58:14.694
You can talk about Arthur.
I just don't like the comparisons.

58:18.536 --> 58:19.628
Okay.

58:20.572 --> 58:24.531
- So, how's it worse?
- You remember Maureen Bailey?

58:25.810 --> 58:27.175
Yeah.

58:27.277 --> 58:30.974
Well, I couldn't get rid of her
after your brother passed away.

58:31.081 --> 58:33.481
- She was always at the house.
- Yeah, I remember that.

58:33.584 --> 58:37.748
Yeah, well, you know,
I never had a moment to myself,

58:37.855 --> 58:39.982
so finally,
in the middle of coffee one afternoon,

58:40.089 --> 58:42.683
I said, "Maureen, why are you always here?"

58:42.792 --> 58:44.623
- And what'd she say?
- She said,

58:44.727 --> 58:47.821
"I want to be there, Nat.
I want to share in your grief."

58:47.930 --> 58:50.490
And I said, "Well, it's not working.

58:50.600 --> 58:53.068
"You plant your fat ass in that chair
every fricking day."

58:53.168 --> 58:54.294
You did not say that!

58:54.403 --> 58:55.427
- I did.
- Mom!

58:55.537 --> 58:57.368
- I did say that.
- You said "fat ass"?

58:57.472 --> 58:59.633
She sucks up all my coffee.

58:59.741 --> 59:03.142
"And I don't see you leaving
with any of this alleged grief you're sharing.

59:03.244 --> 59:06.611
"In fact, the only thing you do take out
of here are my cinnamon buns."

59:07.081 --> 59:12.815
- So I never saw her again, obviously.
- Oh, my God, I can't believe you said that.

59:13.220 --> 59:14.619
I feel guilty now.

59:14.722 --> 59:16.883
- You do not.
- I do.

59:17.824 --> 59:21.055
You're right. I... I don't miss her at all.

59:40.144 --> 59:44.012
Okay, moving right along.
That takes care of Taz.

59:47.418 --> 59:48.885
The old apple pie trick, eh?

59:50.488 --> 59:55.084
For the open house.
Warm baked goods make it feel homier.

59:56.560 --> 59:59.256
No, I'm just... I'm just making a pie.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:03.663
I thought you were doing it
for the open house.

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:09.966
- So... Now. Now, you're not going to stay?
- God, no. No, no. You shouldn't either.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:12.741
You shouldn't.

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:16.243
Come on.
Becca, I'm not going to bother anyone.

01:00:16.344 --> 01:00:20.474
So we have the garbage cans in the back,
the sign out front, I mowed the lawn.

01:00:20.582 --> 01:00:24.143
I thought we'd set the sign-in sheet here.
We can move through the living room.

01:00:24.452 --> 01:00:25.646
That's fine.

01:00:25.754 --> 01:00:29.019
Now, my wife's gonna hide out,
but I'll stick around, if that's okay with you.

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:32.317
Sure. However you want to do it.

01:00:33.127 --> 01:00:35.095
- Okay. Perfect.
- Okay.

01:00:35.195 --> 01:00:36.753
- Bye, babe.
- Bye.

01:00:38.831 --> 01:00:40.765
Think that's everything.

01:01:07.558 --> 01:01:08.525
I know, it's just gorgeous...

01:01:08.626 --> 01:01:11.561
Southern-western exposures. Sun all day.

01:01:12.663 --> 01:01:15.393
- Why don't we take a look upstairs?
- That's a great idea. I'll show you.

01:01:15.498 --> 01:01:16.522
- Good. Cool.
- Follow me.

01:01:16.633 --> 01:01:18.760
- Come on, honey.
- It's on 3l4 of an acre,

01:01:18.868 --> 01:01:22.099
which is the largest lot in the neighborhood.

01:01:22.205 --> 01:01:24.537
We can start with the master bedroom
if you want to see that.

01:01:24.641 --> 01:01:26.404
Wait. What's in here?

01:01:29.111 --> 01:01:32.137
Well... This is... This is...

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:35.579
This would be a good room
for the little guy, obviously.

01:01:35.684 --> 01:01:37.652
How about that, buddy? You like this room?

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:41.285
- Careful with that.
- Sweetheart. That's not our stuff.

01:01:41.389 --> 01:01:44.051
- Thank you.
- So, how old's your son?

01:01:45.626 --> 01:01:47.355
This is your son's room, I assume?

01:01:49.864 --> 01:01:51.593
It... It was. It was his room.

01:01:51.698 --> 01:01:56.294
But he died, my son. He died.
There was a car right out front.

01:01:58.305 --> 01:02:00.466
- Oh, my God.
- I'm...

01:02:01.842 --> 01:02:04.140
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

01:02:04.777 --> 01:02:07.769
This must be so difficult for you.

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:11.076
It's... It's pretty weird.

01:02:13.619 --> 01:02:16.986
It's funny because I still...
I forget that he's not here sometimes.

01:02:17.088 --> 01:02:20.023
Like maybe he's just hiding under the bed,
he's gonna pop out like he used to do.

01:02:21.426 --> 01:02:22.723
But...

01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:27.288
I still feel him here.

01:02:33.337 --> 01:02:36.568
- Would you like to see the master bedroom?
- Yeah. Okay, come on.

01:02:37.107 --> 01:02:39.598
Yeah. Sure, I'll be there.

01:02:41.944 --> 01:02:44.811
- Who's that?
- Becca. She wants to hang out.

01:02:48.551 --> 01:02:51.520
- This was a good idea.
- It's nice, right?

01:02:52.954 --> 01:02:54.819
God, you're starting to show so early.

01:02:54.923 --> 01:02:57.551
I know. I feel like a big old balloon.

01:02:57.659 --> 01:03:00.150
I swear, once this kid is born,
I'm going right to the gym.

01:03:00.729 --> 01:03:03.323
While Mom watches the baby.

01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:07.000
What does that mean,
"While Mom watches the baby"?

01:03:07.101 --> 01:03:10.400
While you're at the gym,
Mom can watch the baby. She loves that.

01:03:10.504 --> 01:03:14.133
Auggie could watch the baby.
He works at night, so he'll be home.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.571
Okay. Auggie then.

01:03:15.675 --> 01:03:19.475
I resent the feeling that I get from you
that I don't deserve this baby.

01:03:19.579 --> 01:03:22.047
Or that I'm not mature enough
or smart enough to take care of it.

01:03:22.148 --> 01:03:25.549
I mean, my God, if Mom could do it,
how hard could it be?

01:03:34.426 --> 01:03:37.088
- This all right?
- Yeah. It's fine.

01:03:37.195 --> 01:03:40.460
I've just got to pick up a few things
and then we can do lunch.

01:03:40.564 --> 01:03:43.727
- Okay. Yeah.
- They're made of strawberries.

01:03:44.001 --> 01:03:47.129
Mommy, please,
can I have some Fruit Roll-Ups?

01:03:47.238 --> 01:03:50.366
- No, Sammy. You know the answer.
- Please?

01:03:50.707 --> 01:03:53.676
- Can I have some, please?
- Sammy, no.

01:03:53.777 --> 01:03:55.870
I want the Fruit Roll-Ups.

01:03:55.979 --> 01:03:58.539
- Not happening.
- Please, I'll be good.

01:03:58.648 --> 01:04:00.013
- Stop it.
- Please.

01:04:00.116 --> 01:04:01.879
- No. You're not gonna get them.
- I promise.

01:04:01.984 --> 01:04:05.852
You know what? It's only three bucks.
Why don't you give him the Roll-Ups?

01:04:07.056 --> 01:04:09.616
Not that it's any of your business,

01:04:09.725 --> 01:04:12.819
but we don't allow candy in our house,
and my son knows that.

01:04:12.928 --> 01:04:15.419
Come on, it's just fruit.
Why don't you give him the treat?

01:04:15.763 --> 01:04:16.730
Are you a mom?

01:04:18.566 --> 01:04:20.796
Yeah, I didn't think so. Excuse me.

01:04:24.105 --> 01:04:26.596
Go to the car. Becca, go to the car.

01:04:26.707 --> 01:04:28.299
Sammy, it's okay.

01:04:28.909 --> 01:04:32.709
She just lost her son eight months ago,
and she's not feeling really very well.

01:04:32.813 --> 01:04:34.246
- I'm so sorry...
- I don't care.

01:04:35.682 --> 01:04:37.115
Mommy's okay.

01:04:46.425 --> 01:04:48.256
- Hey-hey.
- Hey.

01:04:49.461 --> 01:04:50.723
Fun day out?

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.889
- How'd it go here?
- Not so good. Not so good.

01:04:57.802 --> 01:05:01.568
I think we need to clean out that room.

01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:05.041
Okay.

01:05:05.142 --> 01:05:08.509
Maybe make it into a guest room
or something.

01:05:08.612 --> 01:05:10.341
Don't get any ideas.

01:05:15.151 --> 01:05:16.277
Jesus.

01:05:18.388 --> 01:05:19.514
Hello.

01:05:21.424 --> 01:05:24.882
The door was wide open, so...

01:05:25.861 --> 01:05:28.955
- And I knocked, but...
- Taz, shut up!

01:05:29.498 --> 01:05:32.763
I saw the sign out front,
so I thought it'd be okay to...

01:05:32.868 --> 01:05:34.699
- Looking to buy a house?
- Howie.

01:05:34.803 --> 01:05:35.792
No.

01:05:37.571 --> 01:05:40.563
No, I just came to give you this.

01:05:40.674 --> 01:05:43.871
I said I'd let you read it
when it was done, so...

01:05:47.648 --> 01:05:48.706
What is this?

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:51.117
Thank you.

01:05:53.353 --> 01:05:57.187
We bumped into each other in the...
In the library.

01:05:58.825 --> 01:06:02.659
And... And we decided to meet.

01:06:05.164 --> 01:06:06.688
You decided to meet?

01:06:07.399 --> 01:06:10.129
Yeah. Couple of times.

01:06:10.235 --> 01:06:11.224
Okay.

01:06:11.336 --> 01:06:13.804
- Sorry. I didn't realize that you...
- It's...

01:06:14.238 --> 01:06:17.537
- Did you meet here?
- No. No. We met in the park.

01:06:20.678 --> 01:06:21.804
You met in the park.

01:06:24.415 --> 01:06:25.439
Yeah.

01:06:26.283 --> 01:06:27.614
So, my wife

01:06:29.186 --> 01:06:32.246
agrees to meet you in a public place,
and you...

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:36.214
And you what? You apologize?

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:39.787
- I guess.
- You guess? Okay.

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:44.521
- Okay. Okay. You apologize and...
- Come on, Howie, that's enough now.

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:45.895
- And then what?
- That's enough.

01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:48.094
- Look at me.
- Howie. That is enough.

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:50.570
- What is that?
- It's a comic book.

01:06:50.672 --> 01:06:54.836
It's a comic book? A comic book.
Did she tell you to bring it here?

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:57.068
- No, she didn't.
- No, she didn't,

01:06:57.178 --> 01:06:59.305
because this is our house!

01:06:59.414 --> 01:07:02.906
And just because there's a sign out front
doesn't mean that you can pop in!

01:07:03.016 --> 01:07:06.452
- Howie, all right. All right.
- And you just don't... No, it's not all right!

01:07:06.553 --> 01:07:08.851
You just don't walk into somebody's home
like that!

01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:12.918
- You should show a little fucking respect!
- I gotta go.

01:07:15.027 --> 01:07:16.722
You're an asshole.

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:20.031
Wait! Wait, Jason! Wait a minute. I'm sorry!

01:07:20.766 --> 01:07:22.256
I'm an asshole.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.841
Taz, stop it.

01:07:49.526 --> 01:07:51.517
Taz! Taz!

01:07:52.862 --> 01:07:54.295
Taz, stop it!

01:07:58.301 --> 01:07:59.290
Buddy.

01:08:34.935 --> 01:08:36.993
Why didn't you tell me?

01:08:39.872 --> 01:08:43.831
Same reason you don't tell me
why you come home reeking of pot.

01:09:24.145 --> 01:09:25.908
Does it ever go away?

01:09:29.718 --> 01:09:31.151
No.

01:09:33.054 --> 01:09:37.184
I don't think it does. Not for me, it hasn't.
It's going on 11 years.

01:09:40.294 --> 01:09:42.524
It changes, though.

01:09:44.798 --> 01:09:46.095
How?

01:09:48.301 --> 01:09:49.734
I don't know.

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:57.574
The weight of it, I guess.
At some point, it becomes bearable.

01:09:58.678 --> 01:10:02.671
It turns into something
that you can crawl out from under

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:05.750
and carry around like a brick in your pocket.

01:10:06.952 --> 01:10:12.322
And you even forget it for a while,
but then you reach in for whatever reason,

01:10:14.191 --> 01:10:15.749
and there it is.

01:10:17.728 --> 01:10:19.195
"Right. That."

01:10:20.865 --> 01:10:22.423
Which can be awful.

01:10:23.667 --> 01:10:25.430
But not all the time.

01:10:26.469 --> 01:10:27.959
It's kind of...

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.342
Not that you like it, exactly,
but it's what you've got instead of your son.

01:10:35.445 --> 01:10:38.676
So, you carry it around.

01:10:44.687 --> 01:10:47.554
And it doesn't go away.

01:10:50.491 --> 01:10:51.822
Which is...

01:10:53.828 --> 01:10:55.295
Which is what?

01:11:00.133 --> 01:11:03.193
Fine. Actually.

01:12:14.268 --> 01:12:15.257
Hello?

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:16.859
Hi.

01:12:18.205 --> 01:12:20.503
Hi, it's Howie.

01:12:23.376 --> 01:12:25.571
Howie Corbett from group.

01:12:27.714 --> 01:12:29.011
Hi, Howie.

01:12:36.355 --> 01:12:37.982
There you go, boy.

01:12:40.726 --> 01:12:42.956
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:12:43.061 --> 01:12:44.255
You going to group?

01:12:44.363 --> 01:12:47.161
- Yeah. You didn't want to go, did you?
- No.

01:13:25.366 --> 01:13:27.834
...the president, essentially, will get up.

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:29.164
What do you think?

01:13:40.647 --> 01:13:43.309
Hi, it's Jason. Please leave a message.

01:14:18.249 --> 01:14:19.841
You find the house okay?

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.246
Howie?

01:16:18.092 --> 01:16:19.389
I'm sorry.

01:16:43.582 --> 01:16:44.708
Becca?

01:16:50.021 --> 01:16:51.147
Becca?

01:16:54.659 --> 01:16:55.785
Becca?

01:17:00.163 --> 01:17:01.289
Becca?

01:18:18.068 --> 01:18:19.092
God!

01:18:21.338 --> 01:18:22.464
Sorry.

01:18:24.474 --> 01:18:27.773
- What time is it?
- Almost 6:00.

01:18:29.078 --> 01:18:31.774
And you're just getting home?

01:18:47.128 --> 01:18:49.926
- So, how was it?
- It was okay.

01:18:52.266 --> 01:18:54.564
- Well, you look nice.
- Thank you.

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:58.631
Is she your girlfriend?

01:18:59.405 --> 01:19:01.965
No, she's just a friend.

01:19:02.075 --> 01:19:04.475
- She's pretty.
- Yeah.

01:19:05.378 --> 01:19:06.845
She is pretty.

01:19:09.915 --> 01:19:11.678
I liked this so much.

01:19:13.385 --> 01:19:18.186
- It's... Well, it's beautiful.
- Thank you. Thanks.

01:19:18.557 --> 01:19:23.187
It reminded me of Eurydice and Orpheus.
Do you know that myth?

01:19:23.294 --> 01:19:24.921
No.

01:19:25.696 --> 01:19:28.756
Eurydice dies,
and Orpheus misses her so much

01:19:28.866 --> 01:19:34.566
that he travels to Hades to retrieve her and...
Well, in the end, it doesn't work out.

01:19:36.573 --> 01:19:38.165
I should read it.

01:19:40.043 --> 01:19:42.375
So, is the scientist your dad?

01:19:43.346 --> 01:19:46.713
- The scientist that the boy's looking for?
- No.

01:19:47.082 --> 01:19:51.018
- Is it based on him?
- No, my dad was an English teacher.

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:53.622
I was curious about that.

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:56.223
It's just a story.

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:58.987
- I know. I was just...
- Reading into it.

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:07.665
- Do you think they're real?
- Parallel universes?

01:20:11.205 --> 01:20:12.934
I think it's basic science.

01:20:15.175 --> 01:20:17.200
You know, if space is infinite,

01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:19.302
then everything's possible.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.516
So, somewhere out there, I'm what?
I'm making pancakes?

01:20:25.551 --> 01:20:27.382
- Or I'm at a water park?
- Sure. Yeah.

01:20:27.486 --> 01:20:30.887
- Yeah?
- Yeah, both. You know, whatever.

01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:33.720
I think, you know,
it's the laws of probability.

01:20:33.825 --> 01:20:38.421
There are tons of you's out there,
and there's tons of me's floating around.

01:20:39.564 --> 01:20:43.056
Yeah. And this is just the sad version of us.

01:20:44.636 --> 01:20:45.762
Yeah, I guess.

01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:49.670
But there's other versions,
and in these other versions,

01:20:49.773 --> 01:20:53.436
- everything goes our way.
- Assuming you believe in science.

01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:59.042
I like that thought. It's nice.

01:21:03.519 --> 01:21:06.317
Somewhere out there
I'm having a good time.

01:22:14.985 --> 01:22:16.748
I thought you'd left.

01:22:20.057 --> 01:22:21.752
No, I didn't leave.

01:22:28.531 --> 01:22:32.729
I was thinking we could invite
Rick and Debbie over for a cookout.

01:22:37.339 --> 01:22:41.105
Well, she's never gonna call me.
She thinks I hate her, so...

01:22:42.477 --> 01:22:44.035
I'll let her off the hook.

01:22:47.781 --> 01:22:51.581
- A cookout?
- Be good to see the kids.

01:22:51.685 --> 01:22:54.176
Have to...
Have to get something for Emily, though.

01:22:54.288 --> 01:22:57.382
It was her birthday.
She turned four last week.

01:22:57.490 --> 01:22:58.616
Right.

01:23:00.159 --> 01:23:01.217
Okay.

01:23:06.099 --> 01:23:09.466
- Danny's is coming up.
- I know.

01:23:11.737 --> 01:23:14.968
- It's gonna be a tough one.
- Yeah.

01:23:19.344 --> 01:23:20.777
So, that kid,

01:23:22.013 --> 01:23:23.139
Jason,

01:23:25.349 --> 01:23:29.012
- did you tell him we didn't blame him?
- We don't blame him.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.681
No, I know, but did you let him know that?

01:23:33.523 --> 01:23:35.115
Yeah, I guess so.

01:23:36.059 --> 01:23:37.424
That's good.

01:23:38.595 --> 01:23:40.790
- You could talk to him if you want.
- I don't want to.

01:23:40.897 --> 01:23:41.955
Okay.

01:23:48.237 --> 01:23:49.704
It's so quiet.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.840
Well, that's 'cause I slipped Taz
a couple of Ambien.

01:23:54.977 --> 01:23:57.502
- Funny.
- You think I'm joking?

01:24:05.219 --> 01:24:07.153
So, what're we gonna do?

01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:12.922
About what?

01:24:14.027 --> 01:24:16.188
I don't know.

01:24:16.296 --> 01:24:19.026
I don't know. Just pick something.

01:24:23.269 --> 01:24:24.327
Well,

01:24:28.274 --> 01:24:32.768
we could go to Village Toys.
Pick up Candy Land for Emily.

01:24:34.245 --> 01:24:36.713
It's probably something she'd like.

01:24:39.317 --> 01:24:40.909
Candy Land. Yeah.

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:47.590
And then what?

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.621
Then we wrap it.

01:24:56.732 --> 01:24:57.790
And then

01:25:00.736 --> 01:25:02.465
we have the cookout.

01:25:05.842 --> 01:25:08.402
And they'll come over.

01:25:09.277 --> 01:25:10.471
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:13.815 --> 01:25:18.309
And we'll have a couple other people over,
so it's not too awkward for anyone.

01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:20.581
Hi! Oh, my gosh. Look at you!

01:25:20.688 --> 01:25:24.454
And then, to make them feel comfortable,

01:25:24.558 --> 01:25:29.825
we'll ask a bunch of questions
about what the kids have been up to,

01:25:31.364 --> 01:25:34.162
and we'll pretend we're really interested.

01:25:35.068 --> 01:25:36.399
And then...

01:25:38.238 --> 01:25:42.299
And then we'll wait for someone
to bring up Danny

01:25:43.742 --> 01:25:45.607
while the kids are playing,

01:25:46.778 --> 01:25:50.839
and maybe that will go on for a little while.

01:25:51.984 --> 01:25:53.474
And after that,

01:25:55.253 --> 01:25:56.811
they'll go home.

01:26:00.324 --> 01:26:01.791
And then what?

01:26:06.464 --> 01:26:07.897
I don't know.

01:26:13.103 --> 01:26:14.730
Something, though.
