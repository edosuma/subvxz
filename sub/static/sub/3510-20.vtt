01:09.183 --> 01:11.133
Oh.

01:21.511 --> 01:23.467
I'm telling you,
something happened,

01:23.468 --> 01:24.549
something changed.

01:24.550 --> 01:27.464
It's been weird
between us lately.

01:27.465 --> 01:28.498
Lately?

01:28.499 --> 01:30.572
Kate, it's been weird
for four years.

01:30.573 --> 01:33.489
No, this is different.

01:33.490 --> 01:35.518
He's different.
It's like he's pulling away.

01:35.519 --> 01:38.493
Well, can you blame him?
He's probably tired of waiting.

01:38.494 --> 01:40.469
Waiting for what?

01:40.469 --> 01:41.532
What do you think?

01:41.533 --> 01:44.531
The guy is crazy about you.

01:44.532 --> 01:48.515
And despite your little act,
you're crazy about him.

01:48.515 --> 01:50.536
Oh, what, was that supposed
to be some big secret?

01:50.537 --> 01:52.473
Yes.

01:54.983 --> 01:56.004
No.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.024
Do you think he knows?

01:59.025 --> 02:01.003
You remember how he used to be,

02:01.004 --> 02:03.012
girl on either arm?

02:03.012 --> 02:05.000
You really don't see
that guy too much anymore.

02:05.001 --> 02:08.979
Why do you think that is?

02:08.979 --> 02:10.983
He's waiting for <i>you.</i>

02:15.801 --> 02:16.891
Yeah, but, Lanie...

02:16.892 --> 02:18.831
I know.
You're dealing with stuff.

02:18.832 --> 02:23.493
But you cannot ask him
to wait forever.

02:23.523 --> 02:25.792
Unless, of course, you're okay
with him pulling away.

02:25.863 --> 02:26.883
What if it doesn't work?

02:26.884 --> 02:28.839
What if it ends up
like you and Javi?

02:28.840 --> 02:30.796
Well, at least
we gave it a shot.

02:30.797 --> 02:32.850
And so it didn't work out.
So what?

02:32.851 --> 02:35.850
Now we can move on, give or take
the occasional booty call.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.875
I just... I don't want to lose
what we have, you know?

02:38.876 --> 02:40.876
Girl, please.

02:40.876 --> 02:43.843
What exactly do you have,
really?

02:44.885 --> 02:46.884
A friendship.

02:46.885 --> 02:50.825
No. What you and I have
is a friendship.

02:50.826 --> 02:53.801
What you and Castle have
is a holding pattern.

02:53.801 --> 02:56.835
How long can you circle
before the fuel runs out?

03:03.167 --> 03:04.187
Beckett.

03:05.864 --> 03:08.801
Don't think you were saved
by the bell, Kate Beckett.

03:08.802 --> 03:10.806
As your friend, I'm not
gonna let this drop.

03:10.806 --> 03:12.785
So what, you think I should
tell him how I feel?

03:12.935 --> 03:13.959
<i>Yes.</i>

03:13.959 --> 03:16.005
You Hunt murderers
for a living. You can do this.

03:16.006 --> 03:17.033
Okay. Okay.

03:17.034 --> 03:19.996
I just... I-I have to find
the right time.

03:19.996 --> 03:21.030
No time like the present.

03:24.034 --> 03:25.942
What the...

03:27.942 --> 03:28.965
On second thought,

03:28.966 --> 03:30.009
maybe you should wait a bit.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.938
What's that? Ryan's calling.
I gotta go.

03:39.017 --> 03:40.975
I'll call you in about an hour.

03:45.046 --> 03:46.961
Hey there.

03:46.962 --> 03:49.950
I feel like I just walked into
a bad episode of "Miami Vice."

03:49.950 --> 03:52.971
Okay, first, there are no
bad episodes of "Miami Vice."

03:53.006 --> 03:54.401
Second, who died?

03:54.577 --> 03:55.618
You from the looks of it.

03:55.619 --> 03:57.638
You look like you just got
run over by a truck.

03:57.639 --> 03:58.660
Yeah,

03:58.660 --> 04:00.596
a truck delivering
a shipment of awesome.

04:00.597 --> 04:02.562
No, I just flew into Vegas
for the weekend.

04:02.563 --> 04:03.612
Just needed
a little change of scenery.

04:03.613 --> 04:05.968
And you won the blonde
in a high-stakes poker match?

04:06.022 --> 04:07.570
No, I met her
on the flight back.

04:07.618 --> 04:09.198
And you just gave her your car?

04:09.253 --> 04:11.500
Jacinda happens to be
a very trustworthy person.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.126
She's a first-class
flight attendant.

04:13.161 --> 04:14.754
It's not like I gave her
my social security number.

04:14.783 --> 04:15.810
Castle...

04:15.811 --> 04:18.719
Is everything okay?

04:18.719 --> 04:19.815
Never better.

04:27.740 --> 04:29.781
Our victim's
Naomi Allen, age 25.

04:29.782 --> 04:32.732
Her green card indicates
that she's a British national.

04:32.732 --> 04:33.994
Ryan is notifying
the consulate.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.802
Her address is in Soho.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.025
What was she doing
all the way down here?

04:37.053 --> 04:39.010
Don't know, but she checked in

04:39.010 --> 04:40.073
two hours
before she was killed.

04:40.074 --> 04:42.051
I hope they prorated the room.

04:42.052 --> 04:44.092
Good news is,
we have a witness.

04:44.093 --> 04:47.010
The maid who discovered the body
saw a guy run out.

04:47.010 --> 04:48.035
Did the maid get a good look?

04:48.036 --> 04:49.489
She's with
the sketch artist now.

04:49.489 --> 04:51.060
Well, whoever he is,
he was looking for something.

04:51.061 --> 04:52.985
This place has been searched.

04:52.985 --> 04:54.587
The one thing we do know
is that she was not robbed.

04:54.608 --> 04:56.005
Her wallet, watch, and cash
were untouched.

04:56.086 --> 04:58.096
Hey, Lanie, how does it look?

04:58.097 --> 05:00.067
Like you waited too long.

05:00.289 --> 05:01.326
The vic.

05:01.327 --> 05:04.259
She was strangled but she
went down with a fight.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.272
Prelim suggests a sign
of a struggle.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.263
She took one to the face.

05:08.264 --> 05:12.252
A well-dressed, attractive
woman in a seedy motel

05:12.252 --> 05:14.231
and a guy who flees
the crime scene...

05:14.232 --> 05:17.213
This might have been
a one-night stand gone wrong.

05:17.214 --> 05:19.255
Are we talking about
the victim or Castle?

05:19.256 --> 05:21.034
Hey, Espo.

05:21.035 --> 05:22.076
Yeah.

05:22.077 --> 05:25.004
Can you contact the next of kin
and canvass the area once
the sketch is done?

05:25.079 --> 05:26.101
Yeah, no problem.

05:26.102 --> 05:27.292
Hey, Beckett.

05:27.340 --> 05:28.372
Found the vic's business card

05:28.444 --> 05:29.775
in the side pocket
of her purse.

05:30.069 --> 05:33.013
Looks like she works
in Manhattan.

05:33.672 --> 05:35.722
"Naomi Allen, Kittman Group."

05:37.676 --> 05:40.634
Yes, I was
her U.S. booking agent.

05:40.635 --> 05:43.671
Naomi was
one of our top models.

05:43.672 --> 05:45.671
So she was in the city
for work?

05:45.672 --> 05:49.622
She split her time
between here and London.

05:49.622 --> 05:52.705
The good ones usually end up
spending at least half the year
in New York.

05:52.870 --> 05:55.682
Now do you have any idea why
she was at the Alexandria
motel last night?

05:55.683 --> 05:58.690
Uh, no.
I've never even heard of it.

05:58.690 --> 06:02.699
It's one of those, um,
pay-by-the-hour places.

06:04.670 --> 06:08.636
Do you recognize this man?

06:12.628 --> 06:14.606
No. No, I don't.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.619
But you do have an idea
of who he might be.

06:17.620 --> 06:18.681
It's just...

06:18.682 --> 06:20.664
lately,

06:20.665 --> 06:23.689
Naomi was making some choices.

06:23.690 --> 06:25.593
What kind of choices?

06:25.594 --> 06:27.593
Well, she seemed to have
lost interest

06:27.594 --> 06:29.598
in standard modeling jobs.

06:29.599 --> 06:31.614
Recently, she had
been booking more, uh,

06:31.615 --> 06:33.698
unconventional gigs.

06:34.237 --> 06:35.849
Like what?

06:35.849 --> 06:38.178
Well, I heard the London office
booked her to attend

06:38.179 --> 06:41.166
the birthday party
of some foreign dignitary

06:41.166 --> 06:42.228
a few months ago.

06:42.229 --> 06:44.227
She was hired to go to a party?

06:44.228 --> 06:47.215
It's common for models to get
hired to pretty-up an event.

06:47.216 --> 06:49.252
Some girls do it
to pick up extra cash.

06:49.309 --> 06:52.325
And other girls do it
as a way of connecting

06:52.326 --> 06:54.309
with wealthy men.

06:54.766 --> 06:55.829
Uh, wait. Are you saying

06:55.830 --> 06:58.771
that Naomi was hiring herself
out as an escort?

06:58.771 --> 07:00.760
You just don't see
girls as good as Naomi

07:00.761 --> 07:01.833
taking these party jobs.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.758
Not unless there's a bigger
payout involved somewhere.

07:04.787 --> 07:05.868
Do you know if she took on

07:05.869 --> 07:07.837
any of these kinds
of gigs recently?

07:07.838 --> 07:09.853
It's not really what we do.

07:09.854 --> 07:10.874
Oh.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.182
She did want me to try to get her
into an event last night, though,

07:13.183 --> 07:16.315
uh, an album launch party
in midtown.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.612
But I didn't have
any connections to it.

07:18.918 --> 07:20.007
Last night?

07:20.008 --> 07:21.634
Yeah.

07:21.686 --> 07:23.014
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

07:23.014 --> 07:24.426
Yeah, that we should
throw a party

07:24.426 --> 07:25.694
and hire a bunch of models.

07:25.714 --> 07:27.150
No.

07:27.208 --> 07:30.145
That maybe Naomi somehow
got into that party last night

07:30.531 --> 07:32.422
and that that's where
she met her killer.

07:32.422 --> 07:33.462
That's what I was thinking.

07:33.509 --> 07:36.482
Weird. We're usually
more in sync than that.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.003
Hey, Ryan.

07:38.003 --> 07:39.243
Did you find anything
at Naomi's apartment?

07:39.300 --> 07:41.622
No, but someone else might have.
It's been tossed.

07:41.622 --> 07:43.175
Not only that,
but a neighbor said

07:43.239 --> 07:45.455
they saw a man leaving the
apartment late last night.

07:45.456 --> 07:47.026
The neighbor I.D.'ed him
off the sketch.

07:47.027 --> 07:48.976
It's the same guy
who fled the murder scene.

07:48.977 --> 07:50.640
He couldn't find
what he was looking for

07:50.685 --> 07:52.610
in the motel
so he searched her place.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.963
Yeah, but this time,
he left a footprint.

07:54.050 --> 07:55.082
Meaning?

07:55.098 --> 07:57.045
Well, UNIS canvassed around
the apartment with the sketch.

07:57.046 --> 08:00.015
He bought a bottle of
single malt with a credit card

08:00.016 --> 08:01.460
a couple of blocks away.

08:01.461 --> 08:03.478
Colin Hunt.
What do we have on him?

08:03.478 --> 08:05.534
Nothing in the system, but I ran
a trace on the credit card.

08:05.535 --> 08:07.511
He checked into
the mondrian Soho this morning.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.520
Here.

08:21.028 --> 08:22.692
NYPD. Show me your hands.

08:22.732 --> 08:24.410
You're making a mistake.

08:24.432 --> 08:25.990
Yeah, like I haven't
heard that before.

08:26.042 --> 08:28.128
Hands in the air <i>now.</i>

08:28.129 --> 08:31.095
If you insist.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.082
Whoa. Dude.

08:34.089 --> 08:35.100
Whoa.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.510
Allow me to introduce myself.

08:36.578 --> 08:40.004
Detective Inspector Colin Hunt,
Scotland Yard.

08:41.419 --> 08:49.372
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru</font>

08:51.098 --> 08:53.613
You're a long way from home,
Detective Inspector Hunt.

08:55.071 --> 08:57.108
How did you end up in that
dead girl's motel room?

08:57.109 --> 09:00.263
I was at a seminar in D.C.
last night when Naomi called me,
panicked.

09:00.311 --> 09:02.335
She said she was in trouble
and needed my help.

09:02.336 --> 09:03.598
So you knew her?

09:03.647 --> 09:05.285
Naomi was like a sister to me.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.302
Her dad Terence was
my first partner on the job.

09:08.303 --> 09:10.318
When he passed away,

09:10.319 --> 09:13.281
I promised her family
that I'd look after her.

09:13.282 --> 09:15.314
After she called me,
I grabbed the next flight,

09:15.315 --> 09:17.339
but by the time I arrived,
it was too late.

09:17.340 --> 09:20.352
And your first instinct
was to flee the crime scene?

09:20.353 --> 09:24.297
I didn't flee. I left.

09:24.298 --> 09:25.339
She was dead.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.365
There was nothing else to do.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.415
Yeah,
except maybe to hang around

09:29.511 --> 09:30.777
and give the police
a statement.

09:30.781 --> 09:32.554
You and I both know
that if I stuck around,

09:32.615 --> 09:34.782
it'd be hours of questioning,
and then you'd send me off

09:34.805 --> 09:36.194
with a "cheers,
we'll keep you posted."

09:36.231 --> 09:38.305
But I suppose you had
something more important to do.

09:38.356 --> 09:39.895
The room had been searched.

09:39.957 --> 09:41.906
Whoever killed her
was looking for something.

09:41.907 --> 09:43.902
I thought they might try
her apartment next.

09:43.903 --> 09:45.885
By the time I got there,
it had already been tossed.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.910
Look, I know I shouldn't
have been investigating,

09:47.911 --> 09:49.893
but if you were
in a foreign country

09:49.894 --> 09:51.949
and someone you loved
was killed, what would you do?

09:53.945 --> 09:55.920
What were they looking for?

09:56.182 --> 09:58.510
When he was on a job,
Naomi's dad used to stash a gun

09:58.526 --> 09:59.804
in the lining of his kevlar.

09:59.839 --> 10:01.566
When Naomi started modeling
as a teenager,

10:01.621 --> 10:03.621
he didn't want her on the
underground without any protection,

10:03.662 --> 10:05.402
so he taught her
to cut a tiny piece

10:05.415 --> 10:07.529
of the lining in her jacket
to stash pepper spray.

10:07.535 --> 10:09.130
That's where I found it.

10:09.198 --> 10:10.214
You found what?

10:10.215 --> 10:12.234
A message to me

10:12.235 --> 10:14.189
about her killer.

10:14.189 --> 10:16.181
What kind of message?

10:18.185 --> 10:21.171
Not until I'm on the case.

10:21.172 --> 10:22.192
Excuse me?

10:22.193 --> 10:24.180
Detective, please,

10:24.181 --> 10:26.177
I owe this to Naomi.

10:26.177 --> 10:27.214
I owe it to her family.

10:27.215 --> 10:29.234
You do realize
that I could arrest you

10:29.235 --> 10:31.252
for withholding evidence?

10:31.252 --> 10:33.191
And since you don't know
what that evidence is,

10:33.192 --> 10:34.231
I could deny it.

10:34.232 --> 10:38.197
And none of that will get us any
closer to catching her killer.

10:38.198 --> 10:40.176
Let me work this case with you,

10:40.177 --> 10:42.192
because if you don't, I swear,

10:42.193 --> 10:46.181
I will go out there and catch
the bastard on my own.

10:46.181 --> 10:47.231
Okay.

10:48.252 --> 10:51.185
But I have to check in
with my captain first.

10:55.198 --> 10:57.481
What's she like, your captain?

10:57.573 --> 10:59.721
You ever see that Youtube video

10:59.721 --> 11:01.720
of the grizzly bear
that decapitates a moose

11:01.249 --> 11:03.213
with one swipe of its paw?

11:03.214 --> 11:05.193
Comforting.

11:05.511 --> 11:06.566
It's nothing personal.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.566
She just doesn't like outsiders
in her precinct.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.560
I don't need her to like it.
I just need her to allow it.

11:11.561 --> 11:14.498
This whole thing with Naomi
doesn't add up.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.499
Turning down
conventional modeling jobs,

11:16.499 --> 11:18.078
booking sleazy gigs
at private parties...

11:18.130 --> 11:20.154
That just doesn't sound like
the Naomi I know.

11:20.202 --> 11:22.106
Yeah, well, sometimes it's
the people we think we know best

11:22.159 --> 11:24.146
that we don't really know
at all.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.170
Well...

11:34.171 --> 11:35.207
You're in.

11:35.208 --> 11:36.849
Thank you.

11:36.889 --> 11:37.905
What?

11:37.906 --> 11:38.943
Seriously?

11:38.943 --> 11:41.901
Yeah, your supervisor at Scotland
Yard said you're one of the best.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.868
Even captain gates
was impressed with your record.

11:44.868 --> 11:46.893
Well, I guess it's not
outsiders she doesn't like.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.372
It's just me.

11:48.373 --> 11:51.368
Look, we had a deal.
What did Naomi give you?

11:51.369 --> 11:53.381
This.

11:53.382 --> 11:55.348
A key?

11:55.348 --> 11:57.618
- You said she left a message.
- This is the message.

11:57.618 --> 11:59.350
She put it in there
for me to find.

11:59.402 --> 12:00.888
I guarantee, it has something
to do with her death.

12:00.935 --> 12:01.953
This looks commercial.

12:01.954 --> 12:03.853
It's an Arco-Rifkin 11-30-R,

12:03.864 --> 12:06.874
mostly used for lockers like those found
at train stations or health clubs.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.612
All right, well, I'll have Ryan
canvass the area

12:08.639 --> 12:10.309
around her apartment
and the motel.

12:10.385 --> 12:12.048
We'll see if any of
the businesses have lockers

12:12.060 --> 12:13.332
that use this kind of key.

12:13.337 --> 12:14.345
Yo, Beckett.

12:14.345 --> 12:15.366
I got something.

12:15.367 --> 12:16.424
Uh, yeah, detective Esposito,

12:16.486 --> 12:18.395
this is Detective Inspector
Colin Hunt.

12:18.455 --> 12:19.479
He's from Scotland Yard.

12:19.536 --> 12:21.052
He's gonna be consulting
on this case.

12:21.111 --> 12:23.097
- He knows our victim.
- Hey. How's it going?

12:23.098 --> 12:24.605
- Pleasure, mate.
- So what do you got?

12:24.610 --> 12:27.279
Well, Naomi did make it to that
album release party last night

12:27.358 --> 12:28.107
at a club in midtown,

12:28.147 --> 12:30.106
but she was kicked out
by security around 10:00.

12:30.107 --> 12:30.910
Why?

12:30.999 --> 12:34.004
She had an altercation
with the host, female rapper

12:34.031 --> 12:36.024
and ex-felon Nicky Jay.

12:36.025 --> 12:39.016
And she wasn't afraid to take
a swing in front of paparazzi.

12:39.108 --> 12:41.125
Wow. What was
the fight about?

12:41.349 --> 12:43.597
Unclear, but uniforms are bringing
her up to interrogation now.

12:43.694 --> 12:45.112
Do you usually
question them solo?

12:45.145 --> 12:47.080
No, Castle and I usually
go in together.

12:47.129 --> 12:49.109
Actually, you know what? Why
don't you guys take this one?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.606
Are you sure?

12:50.606 --> 12:51.625
Yeah, absolutely.

12:51.626 --> 12:52.664
Besides, Colin's got
a personal interest.

12:52.665 --> 12:54.684
- And I really don't now, do I?
- Ah. All right.

12:54.685 --> 12:57.613
- It's settled then.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

12:57.614 --> 12:59.656
Yeah, besides,
my lunch date is here.

12:59.656 --> 13:00.983
I'll be back in a few hours.

13:00.984 --> 13:03.444
You guys call me if you find
anything interesting.

13:03.521 --> 13:04.540
Hey.

13:04.540 --> 13:06.507
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

13:09.936 --> 13:11.935
Hell, yeah, I clocked her.

13:11.936 --> 13:13.968
She was trying
to make a move on my man.

13:13.969 --> 13:15.968
- Your man Biggie Slim?
- That's right.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.952
She had the nerve to say that he told
her to put her digits in his phone.

13:19.114 --> 13:20.135
Did he?

13:20.135 --> 13:21.191
That ain't the point!

13:21.192 --> 13:23.884
That skinny bitch wasn't even
supposed to be there.

13:23.950 --> 13:25.927
When I got up in her face,

13:25.928 --> 13:28.777
she said Biggie Slim's cousin
Drew told her about the party.

13:28.839 --> 13:31.830
But I knew that was B.S. because
Drew wasn't even invited.

13:32.006 --> 13:34.014
It must make you so bloody mad

13:34.014 --> 13:36.001
to know your man
has a wandering eye.

13:36.103 --> 13:37.818
I had a girlfriend like that.

13:37.908 --> 13:39.904
Traveled for business.

13:39.904 --> 13:42.645
She'd ring from the airport
to say her flight was canceled.

13:42.704 --> 13:46.323
I come to find out, she was
seeing some other bloke.

13:46.407 --> 13:48.301
She sound like a ho.

13:48.338 --> 13:50.342
All I'm saying is,
I understand your instinct

13:50.343 --> 13:53.250
to lash out at the person
you believe is responsible.

13:53.345 --> 13:56.623
I protect what's mine.
You should do the same.

13:56.685 --> 13:58.688
Is that why you followed
Naomi to the motel

13:58.689 --> 14:01.481
and strangled her
with your bare hands?

14:01.674 --> 14:02.732
You must be high.

14:02.733 --> 14:06.528
That skank wasn't worth
another second of my time.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.539
I told security
to give her the boot,

14:08.540 --> 14:09.612
and that was that.

14:09.613 --> 14:11.565
Really? Can you prove it?

14:11.566 --> 14:14.590
My driver brought us home.

14:14.591 --> 14:19.152
And I was with Biggie Slim
the rest of the night.

14:19.214 --> 14:21.188
Yeah, I went home
with Nicky Jay.

14:21.189 --> 14:23.227
After the tussle,
she was all worked up.

14:23.227 --> 14:26.250
But I like it when she gets worked
up, when she got something to prove.

14:26.251 --> 14:28.210
She said that the fight
started because you were

14:28.211 --> 14:30.242
spending time with this girl.

14:30.243 --> 14:32.202
Oh, yeah, that girl.

14:32.202 --> 14:33.235
Hey, what can I say?

14:33.236 --> 14:37.184
Women are powerless against
my good looks and charms.

14:37.185 --> 14:39.252
Yes, it's a real curse.

14:39.252 --> 14:41.214
You and Naomi...
What did you talk about?

14:41.215 --> 14:43.255
Ah, a little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

14:43.256 --> 14:45.227
She was a bad chick, you know?

14:45.227 --> 14:47.227
But a little off. You know
what I'm talking about?

14:47.228 --> 14:49.227
No, what are you talkin' about?

14:49.227 --> 14:51.223
I mean, she was acting
paranoid, man,

14:51.224 --> 14:54.110
said somebody had
followed her to the party.

14:54.180 --> 14:55.532
I figured she was just
blowing smoke.

14:55.532 --> 14:57.167
Why is that?

14:57.189 --> 14:59.205
Look, I don't just
produce Nicky Jay, all right?

14:59.206 --> 15:01.084
I'm building my brand.

15:01.183 --> 15:04.215
I got Biggie Slim records,
Biggie Slim clothing.

15:04.216 --> 15:06.232
Hell, I even got
a Biggie Slim energy drink.

15:06.233 --> 15:09.224
So some filly comes up
trying to make her time,

15:09.225 --> 15:12.250
it's just a everyday thing
in my life.

15:12.250 --> 15:14.250
Did she tell you who
she thought was following her?

15:14.251 --> 15:16.211
Sure didn't.

15:16.212 --> 15:19.007
I guess she wasn't lying,
though, huh?

15:19.071 --> 15:21.053
Naomi left that party

15:21.054 --> 15:23.063
and then three hours later,
she was dead.

15:23.063 --> 15:25.056
Based on what she told
Biggie Slim,

15:25.057 --> 15:26.711
Naomi knew somebody
was after her.

15:26.739 --> 15:28.740
All right, let's canvass
the area around the party venue,

15:28.986 --> 15:30.435
see if she was being followed.

15:30.453 --> 15:32.521
And let's track down Nicky Jay
and Biggie Slim's driver.

15:32.521 --> 15:33.864
I want to see
if they went straight home.

15:33.909 --> 15:35.028
On it.

15:35.029 --> 15:37.948
So... that story

15:37.949 --> 15:39.973
that you told Nicky Jay
about your girlfriend...

15:40.388 --> 15:41.404
Total pants.

15:41.405 --> 15:43.413
I just wanted her to think
I sympathized.

15:43.413 --> 15:45.384
And honestly,
after meeting Biggie Slim,

15:45.385 --> 15:46.404
I do.

15:46.405 --> 15:48.375
Well, maybe she's hanging on,

15:48.376 --> 15:50.397
hoping that he'll change.

15:50.397 --> 15:52.405
Guys like him never do.

15:58.363 --> 16:00.372
Our M.E.'s
finished the autopsy.

16:00.372 --> 16:01.434
Her larynx is crushed.

16:01.435 --> 16:03.371
Whoever did it was strong.

16:03.372 --> 16:05.429
Large hands, probably a male.

16:05.430 --> 16:07.088
That's like half the city.

16:07.098 --> 16:09.218
We may be able to narrow it down
a little further than that.

16:09.410 --> 16:12.371
The pressure
from the killer's grip

16:12.372 --> 16:14.288
left a print on her neck.

16:14.344 --> 16:15.577
Were you able to pull a print?

16:15.644 --> 16:16.984
We recovered a partial

16:16.999 --> 16:18.995
thanks to the body lotion
she was wearing.

16:20.895 --> 16:21.962
Is it in the system?

16:21.986 --> 16:23.985
Not enough to run it,
but you bring me a print

16:23.986 --> 16:27.927
off a suspect, I can tell you
if it's a match.

16:27.927 --> 16:29.944
Excuse me.
I have to make a call.

16:34.935 --> 16:37.955
Easy on the eyes.

16:38.355 --> 16:39.375
- Cute accent, too.
- Mm.

16:39.376 --> 16:41.316
I just got one question.

16:41.317 --> 16:42.330
Hmm?

16:42.330 --> 16:43.401
Where's Castle?

16:43.218 --> 16:46.149
He took off...

16:46.150 --> 16:48.932
for a lunch date.

16:48.986 --> 16:51.070
In a Ferrari
full of flight attendant?

16:51.070 --> 16:52.589
Yeah, he's probably trying
to rack up

16:52.746 --> 16:53.759
his frequent flyer miles.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.746
I'm sorry.

16:55.747 --> 16:57.758
But you know she's just
a passing thing.

16:57.759 --> 17:00.750
Do I? I mean, the guy
has been divorced twice,

17:00.751 --> 17:02.791
and he's still chasing bimbos.

17:02.792 --> 17:05.762
Maybe that's just who he is.

17:05.762 --> 17:07.796
Look, maybe it's the wrong time

17:07.797 --> 17:09.751
or maybe he's even
the wrong guy,

17:09.751 --> 17:12.826
but if he is, how long
are you gonna wait to find out?

17:19.780 --> 17:23.746
Ten years, I've been
keeping them company

17:23.747 --> 17:25.747
while they spend
a night or two here

17:25.747 --> 17:28.755
on their way
to where we're all going.

17:29.813 --> 17:32.783
They all had plans, Kate,

17:32.784 --> 17:35.762
things they were gonna do
when they got around to it...

17:35.763 --> 17:40.825
Go on a cruise, lose 10 pounds,
fall in love.

17:40.826 --> 17:43.826
They thought they had
all the time in the world.

17:43.826 --> 17:46.772
But nobody does.

17:54.776 --> 17:57.783
The personal ones are tough.

17:57.784 --> 18:00.754
No call.

18:00.755 --> 18:03.754
What's my tell?

18:03.755 --> 18:06.762
The brooding lean.

18:06.763 --> 18:08.821
Ah, yes.

18:08.822 --> 18:12.763
Rookie move.

18:12.763 --> 18:14.749
You know, even with
a mouth full of braces,

18:14.750 --> 18:16.738
she was the prettiest girl
in her class.

18:17.487 --> 18:20.574
Although having a cop for a dad
didn't do much for her social life.

18:20.575 --> 18:23.507
Terry used to interrogate
her dates

18:23.507 --> 18:24.553
when they'd drop her off.

18:24.554 --> 18:27.486
I could see how that would
weed out the lightweights.

18:27.488 --> 18:28.505
And then when she was 22,

18:28.506 --> 18:31.491
she fell in love with
a young doctor, good guy.

18:31.492 --> 18:34.542
He died last year in Africa
doing God's work.

18:34.542 --> 18:37.542
I don't think she ever really got over
it, because hearing what she was up to,

18:37.543 --> 18:40.530
it's like she was
a different person.

18:42.576 --> 18:45.484
People change
when you're not looking.

18:46.505 --> 18:47.522
Excuse me.

18:50.555 --> 18:51.613
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

18:53.555 --> 18:54.579
Are you sure?

18:54.580 --> 18:56.608
Where?

18:56.609 --> 18:59.149
Okay, great.
Call in a warrant.

18:59.183 --> 19:00.692
They found a gym
near the motel.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.109
Naomi bought a day pass there
the night that she was killed,

19:03.140 --> 19:05.200
and the clerk said she was
in and out in three minutes.

19:06.056 --> 19:08.067
Just enough time to run in
and hide something

19:08.067 --> 19:10.000
in one of the lockers.

19:11.488 --> 19:13.516
She bought the day pass
at 10:24 P.M.

19:13.517 --> 19:15.321
That's 20 minutes
after she called me

19:15.384 --> 19:17.401
to say she was in trouble.

19:26.393 --> 19:29.363
She was leaving me a message.

19:29.363 --> 19:31.368
She did better than leave
a message about the killer.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.359
She left us a picture
of him as well.

19:42.144 --> 19:43.163
Anything on
the number sequence?

19:43.164 --> 19:45.126
We're running it
through every database,

19:45.127 --> 19:47.130
- but nothing so far.
- Naomi wrote it on there for a reason.

19:47.350 --> 19:48.295
What about the photo?

19:48.340 --> 19:50.332
Well, based on the light
and background architecture,

19:50.333 --> 19:52.853
this photo was taken
in midtown New York.

19:52.941 --> 19:53.958
Hey. What did I miss?

19:53.959 --> 19:55.036
Not much.

19:55.037 --> 19:57.962
Oh, we did manage
to find that mystery locker.

19:57.962 --> 19:58.999
And that guy in the photo,

19:59.000 --> 20:00.962
he's probably our killer.

20:01.979 --> 20:02.995
How was your lunch?

20:02.996 --> 20:04.944
Oh, I loved the special.

20:04.945 --> 20:05.961
I'll bet.

20:05.962 --> 20:06.966
Wait a minute.

20:06.966 --> 20:07.995
Can you blow up
this one section?

20:07.996 --> 20:09.958
Yeah, sure.

20:10.979 --> 20:12.962
Rounded and gold?
It's a plaque.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.018
It's the British seal.

20:14.019 --> 20:15.966
This picture was taken right
outside the British consulate.

20:15.967 --> 20:18.945
Pull up a list
of the consulate employees.

20:18.945 --> 20:20.016
Here you go.

20:21.979 --> 20:24.979
Well, he's not on this page.

20:24.979 --> 20:25.999
There he is.

20:27.037 --> 20:29.024
Nigel Wyndham.

20:29.024 --> 20:30.964
Deputy general
of the British consulate.

20:30.965 --> 20:33.687
Which means he's just under
the consulate general in rank,

20:33.705 --> 20:34.912
so he's responsible
for the daily operations

20:34.995 --> 20:36.970
in financial
and logistical matters.

20:36.971 --> 20:39.979
What the hell was Naomi
doing mixed up with this guy?

20:39.982 --> 20:41.936
That was my mate
at Scotland Yard.

20:41.973 --> 20:44.985
He found out some intriguing
details on Nigel Wyndham,

20:44.985 --> 20:47.797
like the fact that a girlfriend in
college died rather mysteriously

20:47.832 --> 20:49.294
while they were on holiday
in Rome.

20:49.430 --> 20:50.476
Well, was he ever charged?

20:50.477 --> 20:53.410
No, and after that, he had
a string of bad investments

20:53.410 --> 20:54.468
until he married
Cynthia wadlow.

20:54.469 --> 20:56.421
It was her prominent family

20:56.422 --> 20:58.422
who pulled strings
that got him a position,

20:58.422 --> 20:59.464
first at the ministry
of culture,

20:59.465 --> 21:01.446
- and then here at the consulate.
- Yo.

21:01.447 --> 21:03.476
So we've been reconstructing
Naomi's movements

21:03.476 --> 21:05.458
since she landed in New York
a couple of weeks ago.

21:05.459 --> 21:06.479
Her financials indicate

21:06.480 --> 21:08.447
that she booked a car service
last week

21:08.448 --> 21:09.605
that dropped her at nob...

21:09.661 --> 21:11.349
Now we showed the host
Nigel's picture,

21:11.421 --> 21:12.999
and he confirmed
that they met for dinner.

21:13.034 --> 21:14.317
Did the host notice anything?

21:14.399 --> 21:16.381
Yeah, he noticed the C-Note
that Nigel dropped

21:16.382 --> 21:18.046
to secure the romantic table
in the back.

21:19.535 --> 21:20.463
Hey.

21:20.517 --> 21:21.532
I just called the consulate.

21:21.533 --> 21:23.517
The day after
the romantic nobu dinner,

21:23.518 --> 21:26.004
security removed Naomi
from Nigel's office.

21:26.061 --> 21:27.358
Well, it sounds like a fight.

21:27.539 --> 21:30.517
Uh, security heard Naomi
yell something about Cynthia

21:30.517 --> 21:31.584
as they escorted her out.

21:31.585 --> 21:33.566
Well, it makes perfect sense.

21:33.567 --> 21:36.516
Stuck in a marriage
of convenience,

21:36.517 --> 21:39.537
Nigel meets the young
and beautiful Naomi,

21:39.620 --> 21:41.656
finds her irresistible.

21:41.657 --> 21:44.644
A chance meeting turns
to dinner, dinner to a tryst,

21:44.645 --> 21:46.635
but then Naomi wants more.

21:46.636 --> 21:50.607
Nigel realizes that his affair
has become a threat

21:50.607 --> 21:52.645
to his position, his reputation,
to the life he built

21:52.646 --> 21:55.665
on the backs of his wife
and her family.

21:55.666 --> 21:58.602
Sir, if Nigel's wife
found out about an affair,

21:58.603 --> 22:01.603
it would kill his marriage
and his career.

22:01.603 --> 22:02.645
Detective Inspector Hunt,

22:02.646 --> 22:05.624
I take your silence to mean
that you don't agree?

22:06.127 --> 22:07.369
Well, the Naomi I knew

22:07.422 --> 22:10.367
would never fall
for someone like Wyndham,

22:10.367 --> 22:12.350
but she wouldn't have left
his picture in that locker

22:12.351 --> 22:14.362
if he weren't connected
to her death somehow.

22:14.362 --> 22:16.662
Nigel Wyndham's position at the
consulate includes diplomatic immunity.

22:16.701 --> 22:19.669
Which would be waived if he was
a suspect in a murder case.

22:19.905 --> 22:21.911
If I pick up the phone
to make that request,

22:21.912 --> 22:24.870
I'm gonna need something more
concrete than just a theory.

22:24.871 --> 22:26.911
Sir, Lanie pulled
our killer's prints

22:26.912 --> 22:28.925
off of our victim's neck.

22:28.925 --> 22:30.860
And given everything
that we know right now,

22:30.861 --> 22:32.891
I am willing to bet that
they're a match to Nigel's.

22:32.892 --> 22:34.849
A bet's not enough.

22:34.850 --> 22:36.854
But if you can get
those prints,

22:36.854 --> 22:38.891
then this is
a whole different conversation.

22:44.850 --> 22:46.146
Here's the problem, bro...

22:46.215 --> 22:47.856
foreign dignitaries don't
register their fingerprints

22:47.938 --> 22:49.279
with local law enforcement.

22:49.279 --> 22:52.278
And if we put in a request to the
consulate, they'll box us out

22:52.279 --> 22:54.304
and alert Nigel
that he's a suspect.

22:54.304 --> 22:56.294
Yeah, I thought Scotland Yard
would be able to get them.

22:56.295 --> 22:58.321
Even with his connections
across the pond, we struck out.

23:00.897 --> 23:02.926
Okay, boys.
Here it is.

23:02.926 --> 23:04.872
Here's what?

23:05.897 --> 23:07.908
My foolproof plan for
getting Nigel's fingerprint.

23:07.909 --> 23:09.897
Nigel lives
in a high-rise apartment

23:09.898 --> 23:11.893
here on Park avenue.

23:11.893 --> 23:12.893
Yeah. High security.

23:12.894 --> 23:14.946
Exactly.
Ryan, you'll be here...

23:14.947 --> 23:17.925
Front door... dressed
as a flower delivery boy.

23:17.926 --> 23:20.863
Esposito, you'll be here
dressed as a hobo.

23:20.864 --> 23:21.902
Question.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.431
Why's the brown man
gotta be a hobo?

23:23.475 --> 23:24.803
You want the flowers?

23:25.043 --> 23:26.068
Hobo it is.

23:26.069 --> 23:28.081
You boys will cause
a distraction here

23:28.081 --> 23:30.060
whilst I rappel
down the side of the building

23:30.061 --> 23:32.088
- with Nicolai.
- Who's Nicolai?

23:32.089 --> 23:34.092
He's a Romanian gymnast
I found on Youtube.

23:34.093 --> 23:37.354
He's extremely flexible and
fits in the duffel bag.

23:37.449 --> 23:38.469
Using a glass cutter...

23:38.470 --> 23:39.507
- Excuse me, gents.
- I can...

23:39.508 --> 23:42.454
Has anyone seen
detective Beckett?

23:51.899 --> 23:52.944
Wow.

23:52.945 --> 23:54.907
Uh, you guys going out?

23:55.056 --> 23:57.039
I pulled some strings
and got us into a party

23:57.040 --> 23:59.076
at the British consulate
tonight.

23:59.077 --> 24:00.339
Nigel will be there.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.087
We'll get his prints,
and he won't even know it.

24:02.756 --> 24:04.763
Cheers, lads.

24:04.763 --> 24:06.713
Cheers.

24:11.793 --> 24:13.726
Or they could do that.

24:15.734 --> 24:17.704
Yeah, sure,

24:17.705 --> 24:20.704
if you want to do it
the easy way.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.697
Thank you.

24:27.765 --> 24:29.303
So who is sir Alfred Heath?

24:29.349 --> 24:31.418
Tonight, I am.

24:31.486 --> 24:33.518
The lads back home said
the real sir Alfred

24:33.519 --> 24:34.969
is down as a no-show.

24:35.020 --> 24:36.064
Gout or some damn thing.

24:36.065 --> 24:38.104
Yeah, but what if Nigel Wyndham
doesn't show either?

24:38.105 --> 24:40.046
He'll be here.

24:40.086 --> 24:41.591
And I expect he'll skip
the champagne

24:41.608 --> 24:43.405
and drink something posh
and pretentious,

24:43.413 --> 24:45.061
leaving his print on the glass.

24:45.087 --> 24:48.007
Well, what if he doesn't drink?

24:47.965 --> 24:48.998
He's British.

24:48.998 --> 24:50.057
Trust me, he drinks.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.671
May I?

24:56.738 --> 24:59.087
I didn't realize that dancing
was a part of the plan.

24:59.104 --> 25:02.069
Oh, well...

25:02.070 --> 25:04.141
It offers
a perfect vantage point.

25:04.141 --> 25:06.108
Huh.

25:08.807 --> 25:10.370
Do you come
to a lot of these events?

25:10.418 --> 25:11.778
No, thank God. Why?

25:11.826 --> 25:13.858
You just seem very confident.

25:13.859 --> 25:15.809
Ah.

25:15.809 --> 25:16.826
Well, that's because
my companion

25:16.827 --> 25:18.834
is the most beautiful woman
in this room.

25:22.472 --> 25:24.514
That's clearly
the champagne talking.

25:24.514 --> 25:27.540
I'm sure you're just comfortable here
because you're amongst your own people.

25:27.605 --> 25:28.656
These aren't my people.

25:28.657 --> 25:31.676
My people are the ones
carrying the trays.

25:31.677 --> 25:33.639
Yeah.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.630
I grew up on the East End.

25:35.631 --> 25:38.618
My mom cleaned flats.
Dad worked in a factory.

25:38.619 --> 25:40.630
They wanted something better,
they just...

25:40.631 --> 25:42.643
They couldn't quite get it.

25:42.904 --> 25:43.940
And then?

25:43.941 --> 25:46.915
I was admitted to Eton
on a scholarship

25:46.916 --> 25:48.857
where I minored in blending in.

25:48.858 --> 25:49.937
- Oh.
- What about you?

25:52.904 --> 25:54.895
I grew up in the city

25:54.896 --> 25:56.941
and, uh, went to college
in California.

25:56.941 --> 25:58.912
Well, you could obviously
do anything

25:58.913 --> 26:00.561
you put your mind to.

26:00.617 --> 26:01.654
Why be a cop?

26:01.655 --> 26:03.641
I guess it was just my calling.

26:03.642 --> 26:05.650
Ah, a crusader.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.642
I know the type.

26:07.642 --> 26:11.621
Doesn't leave a lot of time for
personal life, though, does it?

26:12.655 --> 26:14.696
What about you? Are you
the crusader type as well?

26:14.697 --> 26:16.662
Married to the bit, I'm afraid.

26:16.663 --> 26:18.642
The job comes first.

26:18.642 --> 26:20.638
Though sometimes,
I wish it didn't.

26:20.639 --> 26:22.655
Yeah. I know the feeling.

26:30.663 --> 26:32.642
Wait a minute.
Look over there by the bar.

26:32.643 --> 26:33.675
My 1:00.

26:38.663 --> 26:40.663
Let the games begin.

26:49.675 --> 26:52.646
All right. Take care.

26:57.655 --> 26:58.704
Good evening.

26:58.705 --> 27:02.642
Nigel Wyndham.
Deputy general.

27:02.642 --> 27:03.675
Jean Harrington.

27:03.676 --> 27:05.624
Bored.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.663
Well, we'll have to remedy
that, Ms. Harrington.

27:07.663 --> 27:09.709
Uh, one for the lady, please.

27:12.684 --> 27:15.620
Oh, a ring.
That's discouraging.

27:15.621 --> 27:17.701
Oh, well, it needn't be.

27:17.701 --> 27:20.667
To new friendships.

27:23.705 --> 27:27.679
Now tell me, Ms. Harrington,
are you here alone?

27:27.680 --> 27:30.645
If so, it would be
a grave injustice.

27:30.646 --> 27:33.666
My date's more interested
in networking than he is in me.

27:33.667 --> 27:35.687
In that case, he won't object

27:35.688 --> 27:38.620
if I ask you for a dance.

27:38.621 --> 27:40.683
You know what?

27:40.684 --> 27:43.650
I wouldn't care even if he did.

27:43.651 --> 27:45.705
Shall we?

27:45.705 --> 27:47.642
Mm-hmm.

27:58.705 --> 28:01.704
So... tell me,
Ms. Harrington,

28:01.705 --> 28:04.646
what should I know about you?

28:04.646 --> 28:06.642
Well, there's more to me
than meets the eye.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.674
Well, what meets the eye

28:08.675 --> 28:11.629
is irresistible.

28:11.892 --> 28:14.962
You know, actions
speak louder than words.

28:14.963 --> 28:16.932
Meaning?

28:16.933 --> 28:18.967
Meaning,
if I'm so irresistible,

28:18.967 --> 28:23.908
then why aren't you using
both your hands?

28:35.904 --> 28:37.874
Excuse me, your excellency.

28:37.875 --> 28:39.887
Oh, excuse me. Pardon me.

28:39.887 --> 28:40.963
Coming through. Oh.

28:40.964 --> 28:42.958
- Sorry, sir. As you were.
- Very rude!

28:44.904 --> 28:46.949
- Excuse me. Oh.
- Oh!

28:46.950 --> 28:49.392
Excuse me.

28:49.396 --> 28:50.421
Sir Alfred Heath?

28:51.232 --> 28:52.250
Yes.

28:52.251 --> 28:53.597
Might I have a word, sir?

28:53.686 --> 28:55.749
There seems to be two of you
here this evening.

29:02.678 --> 29:04.740
All right.
Let's try this way.

29:05.757 --> 29:07.719
I-I have to ask,

29:07.720 --> 29:11.695
are you as aggressive
in your other activities

29:11.695 --> 29:13.270
as you are on the dance floor?

29:13.343 --> 29:15.557
Ah, you know, what can I say?

29:15.584 --> 29:18.580
I like to lead...
all the time.

29:18.580 --> 29:19.620
Well, there's obviously
been a serious mistake.

29:19.621 --> 29:20.636
I am the real sir Alfred,

29:20.637 --> 29:22.643
so if there's somebody else,
uh, here as sir Alfred,

29:22.644 --> 29:24.667
then they're obviously, uh,
an imposter.

29:24.668 --> 29:26.608
Uh, you have any I.D.?

29:26.609 --> 29:28.596
- Uh, I-I actually don't have any.
- Are you...

29:28.597 --> 29:31.255
- no, no, I've left my, um...
- Is... is everything all right?

29:31.293 --> 29:33.301
Um, yeah. You know,
I'm suddenly...

29:33.302 --> 29:36.301
I feel very hungry.
Excuse me.

29:36.302 --> 29:39.238
Would you like one of these?
I hear they're great.

29:39.239 --> 29:41.271
I'm not a caviar man myself.

29:41.272 --> 29:43.284
Yeah, but I hear
they're an aphrodisiac.

29:43.285 --> 29:45.242
Mm. Not for me, I'm afraid.

29:45.243 --> 29:47.280
I'm sorry
to intrude, Mr. Wyndham, sir.

29:47.281 --> 29:49.221
Yes, what is it, Bryson?

29:49.222 --> 29:51.259
Uh, the young lady,
I need her to come with me.

29:51.260 --> 29:52.848
Well, for what purpose?

29:52.902 --> 29:53.939
Don't worry, darling.

29:53.940 --> 29:56.914
I know that we'll see
each other again very soon.

30:01.956 --> 30:04.896
I had the waiter,
then I lost him.

30:04.897 --> 30:06.881
I've bollixed up
the whole plan,

30:06.881 --> 30:07.910
and now we've got nothing.

30:07.911 --> 30:09.917
Oh, I wouldn't say nothing.

30:09.918 --> 30:11.881
I swiped Wyndham's card case.

30:11.881 --> 30:12.926
It's got his prints
all over it.

30:12.927 --> 30:15.623
You sneaky little thief.

30:15.668 --> 30:17.304
That's bloody brilliant.

30:17.333 --> 30:21.299
Thank you. Now let's go
get this son of a bitch.

30:23.778 --> 30:24.774
The print's not a match.

30:24.806 --> 30:25.838
What?

30:25.838 --> 30:27.794
C.S.U. ran the fingerprints
off the card case,

30:27.995 --> 30:30.652
compared 'em to the one that
Lanie found on Naomi's body.

30:30.652 --> 30:31.855
It wasn't Nigel Wyndham's.

30:31.917 --> 30:34.058
No, that's not possible.
Run it again.

30:34.058 --> 30:35.432
Ryan already did that
three times.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.337
Wyndham's not our killer.

30:36.338 --> 30:37.358
He's behind this.
I know it.

30:37.359 --> 30:39.202
It's why Naomi left us
his photograph.

30:39.217 --> 30:41.691
Well, maybe he hired someone
to do his dirty work for him.

30:41.691 --> 30:42.889
Like one of his security men.

30:42.929 --> 30:44.688
Can you get Scotland Yard
to run background checks

30:44.748 --> 30:45.556
on the security staff?

30:45.637 --> 30:48.610
<i>Or </i> a better path might be to
look into this mysterious number

30:49.378 --> 30:52.918
that Naomi wrote on the back of that
photo, which is a mystery no longer.

30:53.021 --> 30:54.040
Is this lobster, bro?

30:54.041 --> 30:55.907
Lucky for you,
Jacinda's a light eater.

30:55.929 --> 30:57.924
You heat that up,
little bit of melted butter...

30:57.925 --> 30:59.932
Are you telling us you know
what that number means? How?

30:59.933 --> 31:01.922
Well, as Jacinda and I
were enjoying

31:01.923 --> 31:03.920
our succulent lobsters
from Maine,

31:03.921 --> 31:04.957
paired with an earthy

31:04.958 --> 31:06.942
yet elegant Pinot Noir
from sonoma valley...

31:06.943 --> 31:08.938
Castle, numbers.

31:08.938 --> 31:10.278
Right. Well, we were
going over the file.

31:10.352 --> 31:11.837
Turns out Jacinda's
quite a little crime solver.

31:11.837 --> 31:14.810
You showed the stewardess
the evidence file?

31:14.811 --> 31:16.814
<i>No.</i>

31:16.815 --> 31:18.752
I took a picture of it
with my phone.

31:18.761 --> 31:21.743
And the preferred nomenclature
is "flight attendant."

31:21.744 --> 31:23.797
The point is,
this code refers to

31:23.798 --> 31:25.523
a diplomatic pouch.

31:25.607 --> 31:26.526
How do you know that?

31:26.604 --> 31:28.013
Jacinda recognized the format.

31:28.056 --> 31:29.966
Furthermore, she told me
these last three digits

31:30.026 --> 31:33.018
are a reference code
for royal eastern airlines.

31:33.018 --> 31:35.038
Which means the pouch was
delivered on that airline.

31:35.039 --> 31:37.983
Exactly. The "W4" refers to
the size of the pouch,

31:37.984 --> 31:40.983
the "1949" indicates
exactly which pouch it is

31:40.984 --> 31:42.684
in the consulate sequence.

31:42.754 --> 31:45.119
As the deputy general,
Nigel signs for all the pouches.

31:45.178 --> 31:47.579
So then maybe this wasn't
about an affair gone wrong

31:47.616 --> 31:48.781
between Nigel and Naomi.

31:48.788 --> 31:50.774
- It's about smuggling.
- Well, that makes a lot of sense.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.841
Diplomatic pouches are sealed
and their contents

31:52.842 --> 31:55.571
bypass T.S.A.
and customs inspections.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.628
Naomi must have got on to what
Wyndham was doing somehow.

31:57.706 --> 31:58.859
We need to know
what was in that pouch.

31:58.931 --> 32:00.572
The consulate's never gonna
release that information.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.907
Oh, we don't have to worry
about the consulate.

32:01.924 --> 32:04.877
The airline keeps a copy
of the waybill.

32:04.877 --> 32:07.923
Get ahold of the airline. Let's
get that waybill down here.

32:09.700 --> 32:10.734
Ryan, grab a pen.

32:21.734 --> 32:22.728
What?

32:22.729 --> 32:24.733
Castle, you can't just share

32:24.734 --> 32:27.778
confidential police information
with an outsider.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.750
Even if it solves the case?

32:31.149 --> 32:32.185
I mean, she gave us a lead.

32:32.186 --> 32:34.178
That's more than you got
at the consulate.

32:34.179 --> 32:36.183
And that's supposed to
make this all okay?

32:36.183 --> 32:38.166
Jacinda just wanted to help.
What's the big deal?

32:38.167 --> 32:39.928
You don't get it, do you?

32:39.941 --> 32:40.946
No, I guess I don't.

32:40.947 --> 32:42.912
No, I gu...
I guess you don't.

32:42.912 --> 32:44.937
We found something
you're gonna want to see.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.056
The airline e-mailed over
the waybill.

32:52.124 --> 32:54.098
The pouch
that matches our number

32:54.098 --> 32:55.392
was shipped
from the British consulate

32:55.446 --> 32:56.455
about a year ago.

32:56.456 --> 32:59.425
It flew from J.F.K.

32:59.426 --> 33:01.438
To Kampala, Uganda.

33:01.439 --> 33:03.475
Uganda? That can't be
a coincidence.

33:03.476 --> 33:04.960
What do you mean?

33:04.990 --> 33:07.758
Naomi's boyfriend, the one who
died, he was killed in Uganda.

33:07.913 --> 33:09.941
Any idea of what
was being shipped?

33:09.941 --> 33:11.889
Uh, just that it weighed
200 pounds.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.677
Well, that's awfully heavy
for a pouch.

33:13.727 --> 33:16.028
Well, a diplomatic pouch
can be as small as an envelope

33:16.074 --> 33:17.469
or as big as a cargo container.

33:17.517 --> 33:19.396
Whatever's being
shipped, it's being sent out

33:19.481 --> 33:20.721
about once a month.

33:20.820 --> 33:23.424
I just combed through airline
waybills from the past year.

33:23.513 --> 33:25.350
Ten other pouches,
all the same weight,

33:25.427 --> 33:26.932
were flown from here to Uganda.

33:26.992 --> 33:30.503
In fact, one of them is listed as being
in J.F.K.'s secure baggage area.

33:30.531 --> 33:32.102
You mean to say,
one of those pouches

33:32.199 --> 33:33.788
is at the airport right now?

33:33.865 --> 33:36.807
Finding out what's in that pouch
could tell us who killed Naomi.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.805
Yeah, but we don't have
any jurisdiction here, Castle.

33:38.806 --> 33:41.661
If the NYPD tries to open up
a British diplomatic pouch,

33:41.690 --> 33:43.356
we could risk
an international incident.

33:43.790 --> 33:46.803
Then it's a good thing
I'm not NYPD.

33:54.498 --> 33:55.810
- Hey!
- Oh.

33:55.841 --> 33:56.768
Good evening, sir.

33:56.837 --> 33:58.794
I'm agent Bauer
with Homeland Security.

33:58.795 --> 33:59.809
I'm here for the inspection.

33:59.810 --> 34:02.632
Nobody radioed me
about any inspection.

34:02.722 --> 34:04.564
Well, of course they didn't.

34:04.564 --> 34:06.337
We conduct random checks
to assess security.

34:06.424 --> 34:08.228
Telling you we were coming
kind of defeats the purpose.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.004
Am I right?
We'd be tipping our hand,

34:10.081 --> 34:11.501
showing our play book,
so to speak.

34:11.524 --> 34:12.833
Two years, I've worked
this shift,

34:12.835 --> 34:14.132
and I've never heard
of anything...

34:14.208 --> 34:16.248
Look, Morgan, is it? I'm sure
you run a tight ship here.

34:16.262 --> 34:17.422
So if things inside are secure,

34:17.505 --> 34:19.480
I'll make damn sure
your bosses know about it,

34:19.481 --> 34:21.466
which will reflect well on you.

34:21.467 --> 34:23.525
We're all on the same team
here, pal.

34:23.525 --> 34:26.513
I gotta verify this
with my supervisor.

34:26.513 --> 34:29.509
Yeah, you do that.

34:31.092 --> 34:33.054
I'm getting more adept

34:33.054 --> 34:35.074
at faking my way past people.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.063
Must be all the practice.

34:37.063 --> 34:38.201
You're in the baggage area?

34:38.266 --> 34:40.027
Yeah, but I don't have
much time.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.110
Maybe a minute before the guy
calls his supervisor

34:42.112 --> 34:44.150
- to check my story.
- All right, so based on

34:44.152 --> 34:46.110
the shipping code, the pouch
that you're looking for

34:46.112 --> 34:48.090
is about 5 feet long.

34:48.143 --> 34:49.161
Does the waybill say

34:49.163 --> 34:51.734
if it's a crate, a footlocker,
cardboard box, what?

34:51.741 --> 34:52.775
No, sorry, bro.

34:52.775 --> 34:55.786
But it's 200 pounds, so it's
gotta be something sturdy.

34:55.788 --> 34:58.767
Something sturdy.
Right.

34:58.767 --> 35:00.762
Oh, come on.

35:03.775 --> 35:05.369
Here we go. I found it.
It's a crate.

35:05.429 --> 35:06.424
Agent Bauer!

35:06.425 --> 35:07.959
I need you
to step outta there, please.

35:08.009 --> 35:09.953
Okay, that didn't sound good.

35:09.954 --> 35:11.461
Agent Bauer...
What did he expect?

35:11.559 --> 35:12.630
I heard that.

35:12.630 --> 35:14.592
Uh, I've
just about wrapped up here.

35:14.593 --> 35:16.565
Sir, my supervisor
will be here...

35:16.566 --> 35:18.630
And he will be mighty pleased
with your work, Morgan,

35:18.631 --> 35:20.580
mighty pleased.

35:20.580 --> 35:22.622
It's clear to me that you've
been working harder than a...

35:22.623 --> 35:26.571
One-legged man
in an ass-kicking contest.

35:26.572 --> 35:29.550
Step outta there now, sir.
I will not tell you again.

35:29.551 --> 35:30.587
Hello!

35:30.588 --> 35:33.587
You there? Hello!

35:33.588 --> 35:35.601
Bloody hell.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.572
What's in the crate?

35:41.584 --> 35:43.571
Missiles.

35:48.975 --> 35:51.014
Customs and Homeland Security
have impounded the crate,

35:51.015 --> 35:53.127
and Interpol is on their way
to J.F.K.

35:53.208 --> 35:55.178
How did you explain opening
the diplomatic pouch?

35:55.179 --> 35:57.646
Well, everyone's more interested
in the missiles at the moment,

35:57.647 --> 35:59.459
but I expect I'll be
in hot water at some point.

35:59.494 --> 36:01.452
And where does this
leave Wyndham?

36:01.453 --> 36:03.048
Untouched.

36:03.115 --> 36:04.814
What do you mean untouched?
He was smuggling weapons.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.404
Well, they'll have
an inquiry, of course,

36:06.416 --> 36:07.969
but they can't prove he knew
what was in the crate.

36:08.053 --> 36:09.514
And since we opened
the crate illegally,

36:09.610 --> 36:11.565
we won't be able
to use it as evidence.

36:11.566 --> 36:13.565
At least it all starts
to make sense now.

36:13.566 --> 36:15.627
Naomi was trying to solve
Aiden's murder.

36:15.628 --> 36:18.636
That would be
Naomi's boyfriend... Aiden Miller.

36:18.636 --> 36:21.594
He worked for doctors
without borders in Uganda

36:21.594 --> 36:22.536
until his helicopter
was shot down

36:22.629 --> 36:24.578
by guerilla forces a year ago.

36:24.578 --> 36:25.630
The British government
launched an investigation,

36:25.631 --> 36:27.913
but was never able to determine
how the rebels acquired

36:27.977 --> 36:28.804
a stinger missile.

36:28.881 --> 36:30.837
Which we now know came to them

36:30.838 --> 36:32.821
courtesy of Nigel Wyndham.

36:32.821 --> 36:33.861
Yeah, except Nigel's
not the type

36:33.862 --> 36:35.854
to get his hands dirty
when it comes to missiles

36:35.855 --> 36:37.580
or murder.

36:37.614 --> 36:38.605
He must have had a partner

36:38.606 --> 36:40.067
who had a line
on those stingers.

36:40.098 --> 36:43.060
And if Naomi started looking
into the smuggling operation...

36:43.060 --> 36:45.060
Then perhaps it was
the partner who got rid of her.

36:45.061 --> 36:47.005
So then the question is,
who is this partner?

36:47.049 --> 36:49.053
Everything Naomi did
was about finding out

36:49.053 --> 36:51.018
who supplied the weapon
that killed her boyfriend.

36:51.019 --> 36:52.687
That's why she stopped
taking modeling gigs.

36:52.750 --> 36:56.006
That's why she came to New York.
It's...

36:56.045 --> 36:58.061
Maybe there's someone
on that list of attendees

36:58.061 --> 36:59.995
for that, uh,
foreign dignitary party.

37:00.036 --> 37:02.472
I mean, it all started when she
booked that out of London

37:02.562 --> 37:03.685
a few months ago.

37:03.776 --> 37:04.808
Paulo Makuzi.

37:04.945 --> 37:05.948
And who is he?

37:05.949 --> 37:07.949
A leader of the rebel army
in Uganda.

37:07.949 --> 37:09.884
Naomi must have heard
something at the party.

37:09.885 --> 37:11.872
That's what led her
to the consulate.

37:11.873 --> 37:13.947
And that romantic dinner with
Nigel was just part of her agenda

37:13.948 --> 37:15.907
to get the pouch number
from his office.

37:15.908 --> 37:17.894
So then there's just one piece

37:17.895 --> 37:21.919
that doesn't fit
in her investigation.

37:21.919 --> 37:23.940
What was she doing
with Biggie Slim?

37:25.882 --> 37:27.903
I want you to take a close look
at this photo.

37:27.903 --> 37:28.953
Yeah, I seen this one.

37:28.954 --> 37:30.899
Paparazzi caught me
and Nicky Jay

37:30.967 --> 37:32.321
coming out of the studio
a couple weeks ago.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.948
In fact, that is Nicky Jay's
black S.U.V., isn't it?

37:35.068 --> 37:37.567
- Bought by Biggie Slim himself.
- Mm.

37:37.593 --> 37:40.589
Supply and demand.
She demands, I gotta supply.

37:40.589 --> 37:42.124
You know, the thing
that I find intriguing

37:42.149 --> 37:44.142
is that before you became
Biggie Slim,

37:44.242 --> 37:46.224
you're name was Darius Young,

37:46.224 --> 37:48.256
best known for launching several
failed Internet start-ups.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.174
Just a man ahead of my time.

37:50.258 --> 37:52.809
Well, the S.E.C. thought you were
a man trying to fleece investors.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.459
See, I was never charged
for that.

37:54.487 --> 37:56.485
One of your ventures,

37:56.486 --> 37:58.515
a music sharing web site
based in the U.K.,

37:58.515 --> 38:00.034
caught the attention
of British authorities.

38:00.069 --> 38:02.039
And when they tried
to shut it down,

38:02.106 --> 38:03.471
an aide to
the minister of culture

38:03.472 --> 38:05.034
lobbied on your behalf.

38:05.069 --> 38:06.466
And do you know
who that aide was?

38:06.552 --> 38:09.500
Nigel Wyndham.

38:09.501 --> 38:11.538
In fact, this is Nigel

38:11.538 --> 38:14.526
stepping out of
the very same black S.U.V.

38:16.463 --> 38:17.542
No, I don't think so.

38:17.543 --> 38:20.496
Why don't you take
a closer look?

38:20.497 --> 38:22.538
It's got the same custom
pinstripes on the door.

38:22.538 --> 38:24.553
It's just somebody else's truck
with those stripes on there.

38:24.554 --> 38:28.251
Your driver already admitted that
he drove you to this meeting
outside the consulate.

38:28.314 --> 38:31.189
We also know that your cousin is
in the service... Drew Harris.

38:31.241 --> 38:33.267
A staff sergeant.
He works at an armory.

38:33.341 --> 38:34.373
He supplied the missiles.

38:34.449 --> 38:36.440
You knew that Wyndham
had access

38:36.440 --> 38:38.434
to the diplomatic pouch,
and you saw an opportunity.

38:38.435 --> 38:39.524
Supply and demand.

38:39.525 --> 38:42.511
That's a whole lot
of speculation there, mate.

38:42.511 --> 38:44.497
Well, we weren't the only ones
to put together the pieces.

38:44.498 --> 38:46.478
Naomi wasn't giving you
her phone number.

38:46.479 --> 38:48.465
She was looking for evidence.

38:48.465 --> 38:50.455
Once you realized
that she was the same girl

38:50.456 --> 38:51.515
that Wyndham caught snooping,

38:51.516 --> 38:54.494
you followed her to the motel
and you killed her.

38:56.432 --> 38:58.510
Well, how y'all
gon' prove that?

38:58.511 --> 39:00.528
A partial fingerprint
on Naomi's body...

39:00.528 --> 39:02.486
And it's a match to you.

39:10.457 --> 39:12.431
You know, the thing

39:12.432 --> 39:14.524
that I still can't figure out
is, why Uganda?

39:14.524 --> 39:17.478
Why would you care?

39:19.528 --> 39:23.477
Man, it wasn't about Uganda.

39:23.478 --> 39:26.444
It was just about the money.

39:26.444 --> 39:29.465
I didn't even know where Wyndham
was shipping the stuff to.

39:35.453 --> 39:37.257
Good.
Uh, call my assistant.

39:37.272 --> 39:38.326
I am, uh, wide open all week.

39:38.327 --> 39:39.868
Actually, you're not.

39:39.957 --> 39:41.505
Or the following week,
for that matter.

39:41.510 --> 39:42.767
Told you I'd see you soon.

39:42.768 --> 39:43.789
What is this?

39:43.789 --> 39:46.570
Getting thrown out of here
once already wasn't enough
for you people?

39:46.615 --> 39:47.510
Security.

39:47.573 --> 39:49.514
They can't help you, mate.
Nobody can.

39:49.515 --> 39:51.501
Not even your well-funded
ugandan friends.

39:51.738 --> 39:52.804
Nigel Wyndham...

39:52.805 --> 39:54.814
You're under arrest for
international arms trafficking

39:54.815 --> 39:58.793
and for abetting in the murder
of a British citizen.

40:07.760 --> 40:10.742
Her dad would've been proud...

40:10.743 --> 40:12.826
How brave she was,
taking on these men.

40:12.827 --> 40:15.809
But I so wish
she hadn't done it.

40:15.810 --> 40:18.792
So what happens now?
Do you go back to D.C.?

40:18.793 --> 40:20.826
London, I'm afraid.

40:20.827 --> 40:22.822
Face the music.

40:22.823 --> 40:25.748
You know, they should
give you a commendation.

40:25.748 --> 40:27.743
Well, that is
wildly improbable.

40:28.806 --> 40:30.818
Well, detective Beckett,

40:30.819 --> 40:32.805
it's been a true pleasure.

40:32.806 --> 40:35.809
The pleasure was all mine,
Detective Inspector Hunt.

40:35.810 --> 40:37.819
Please. Colin.

40:37.819 --> 40:39.414
Kate.

40:39.446 --> 40:41.846
You know, I have a few hours
before my flight, Kate.

40:44.744 --> 40:46.827
Could I persuade you
to let me buy you a drink?

40:49.752 --> 40:50.773
Um...

40:55.827 --> 40:59.810
I'm sorry. I have a bit
of paperwork to do.

40:59.810 --> 41:03.769
Another time.

41:08.748 --> 41:09.814
Where's Scotland Yard off to?

41:09.815 --> 41:12.498
Oh, he's going back to London.

41:12.578 --> 41:13.657
Um... Castle,
do you have a second?

41:13.728 --> 41:14.773
Can we talk...

41:14.773 --> 41:17.764
Actually, I don't. Jacinda has the
Ferrari double parked in a loading zone.

41:17.765 --> 41:18.763
Wow.

41:18.764 --> 41:21.727
Four dates in three days.
You like her.

41:21.727 --> 41:23.719
Yeah. Why?

41:26.773 --> 41:30.768
Uh, she just... she doesn't
seem like your type.

41:30.769 --> 41:33.773
Well, she's fun
and uncomplicated.

41:33.773 --> 41:37.719
I think that's what
my life needs right now.

42:01.723 --> 42:04.773
Hi. It's, uh, it's Kate.

42:04.773 --> 42:06.739
Do you still
want to buy me that drink?

42:06.806 --> 42:11.691
