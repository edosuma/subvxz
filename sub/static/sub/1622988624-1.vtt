WEBVTT

01:51.673 --> 01:52.474
- Alexis.

02:03.322 --> 02:06.818
One of the girls said
you were going soon.

02:11.429 --> 02:13.198
Didn't think you'd
still be here.

02:14.597 --> 02:16.498
- Why don't you get comfortable?

02:21.703 --> 02:23.736
- Find yourself a
sugar daddy, did you?

02:25.608 --> 02:26.442
- No.

02:31.317 --> 02:33.416
There's something better.

02:36.454 --> 02:37.255
Keep going.

02:43.791 --> 02:44.823
Mm.

02:46.827 --> 02:47.793
Come closer.

02:54.439 --> 02:55.768
What's wrong?

02:55.803 --> 02:56.802
- Nothing.

02:57.805 --> 02:59.508
I'm just gonna miss this.

03:02.414 --> 03:03.809
- You don't have to go.

03:03.844 --> 03:05.844
I've got a place. It's
small, but we can-

03:05.879 --> 03:09.617
- Shh.

03:12.259 --> 03:14.391
Don't make this harder
than it already is.

03:48.922 --> 03:52.022
- There's no shame in
coming back, you know.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.661
Things change.

03:54.796 --> 03:55.927
And you gotta roll with it.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.964
You thought you
wanted one thing, but,

03:59.999 --> 04:01.768
actually, you wanted
something else.

04:02.969 --> 04:03.803
It happens.

04:05.543 --> 04:07.609
That's not for anyone
else to understand.

04:08.711 --> 04:11.250
You make the change
work for you.

04:13.914 --> 04:14.813
The girls miss you.

04:14.849 --> 04:17.652
You know, Maura, she
can't shut up about you.

04:19.821 --> 04:21.392
See?

04:21.427 --> 04:22.855
You'll be fine.

04:22.890 --> 04:23.757
With the girls.

04:24.925 --> 04:27.860
You could be here if
you wanna be here.

04:29.534 --> 04:30.896
Maybe you shouldn't think
too much about, you know,

04:30.931 --> 04:33.899
why you left, and focus on

04:35.034 --> 04:36.407
why you came back.

04:38.037 --> 04:39.938
He didn't care about you

04:40.875 --> 04:41.907
like I do.

04:44.010 --> 04:44.910
He didn't, did he?

04:46.485 --> 04:47.319
Say it.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.984
- He didn't care
about me like you.

04:54.559 --> 04:56.427
- That's all this is, Carly.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.495
I'm just trying to
get you what you need.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.927
You don't need to
hide around me.

05:02.897 --> 05:03.896
No, I don't give a shit.

05:05.031 --> 05:06.338
Be whoever the
fuck you wanna be,

05:06.373 --> 05:07.966
as long as it doesn't
affect my cut.

05:09.739 --> 05:12.069
That reminds me. It's still
400 a month for the room.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.039
150 for bills, food,
water, the normal shit.

05:16.944 --> 05:19.109
With that being said,
we've gotta take 20 pounds

05:19.144 --> 05:20.913
on whatever you earn,
that's for protection.

05:20.948 --> 05:22.046
No, don't look at me.

05:23.852 --> 05:25.621
We all answer to
someone, you know?

05:28.723 --> 05:31.528
It's for your
benefit, to be honest.

05:31.563 --> 05:33.992
A lot of girls out there
are worse off than you lot.

05:34.896 --> 05:36.401
Some girls don't get a choice.

05:38.603 --> 05:40.438
Unless you want me to sell
you to some fuckin' sheik

05:40.473 --> 05:41.439
with five chins.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.542
Key cutter already thinks
I'm into human trafficking,

05:45.577 --> 05:46.444
for fuck sake.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.006
It's a joke.

05:48.976 --> 05:51.108
Wait, it's a joke. Hey, come on.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.550
Come on. I've
forgotten somethin'-

05:53.585 --> 05:55.519
- Yeah, well it's
not fucking funny.

05:55.554 --> 05:57.015
- I know.

05:57.050 --> 05:59.083
It was dumb. I did like
a ton of coke last night.

05:59.118 --> 06:00.590
It scrambled my
eggs pretty badly.

06:00.625 --> 06:01.888
- We both know that's not it.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.156
- Yeah. Of course.

06:10.932 --> 06:11.964
It was stupid.

06:13.099 --> 06:13.900
I'm an arsehole.

06:19.479 --> 06:20.577
- What did you forget?

06:24.616 --> 06:25.747
- I've already got one.

06:26.816 --> 06:27.617
- It's a trade.

06:29.016 --> 06:30.455
I get it.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.083
He might call, you
might not answer.

06:33.086 --> 06:34.690
It's not about business.

06:35.891 --> 06:36.725
I like you.

06:37.926 --> 06:39.728
You'll do well here.

06:39.763 --> 06:40.993
No one's gonna judge you.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.897
Will you just do us a favor?

06:45.197 --> 06:47.131
Can you try and not
piss off Val, okay?

06:48.134 --> 06:50.739
I'm not a fan of hearing
her whine about someone

06:50.774 --> 06:52.939
turning the heating
off or some petty shit.

06:56.043 --> 06:57.977
This isn't gonna
be like last time.

07:00.619 --> 07:02.685
I'm not gonna tell
you what you can't do.

07:05.052 --> 07:07.459
That's not what this
is. Like you say.

07:33.113 --> 07:35.113
- Oh, Val, just fuck off!

07:35.148 --> 07:36.950
I can see your shadow
through the fucking door!

07:36.985 --> 07:38.985
Val, just fuck off or
I'm calling the police!

07:39.020 --> 07:40.019
- Simone?

07:40.054 --> 07:41.152
It's Carly.

07:42.925 --> 07:43.759
- Carly!

07:44.927 --> 07:46.531
You should've said
something, babe!

07:48.029 --> 07:49.600
Oh, sorry.

07:55.069 --> 07:56.937
Your old room's
free, if you want it.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.107
And Val's fixed the shower, too.

08:04.045 --> 08:05.077
- Nice.

08:26.067 --> 08:28.232
- It's a bit early
for that, init?

08:28.267 --> 08:30.102
At least let me get
the washing done.

08:34.812 --> 08:36.075
Oh, no, no, no.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.210
Cheeky little trollop!

08:44.052 --> 08:45.018
Oh, are you all right?

08:45.053 --> 08:46.316
- Fucking' taste your underwear.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.087
- I said sorry, mate.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.165
You know, I didn't think
you were coming back.

09:01.839 --> 09:04.202
I thought that-
- Shh.

09:04.237 --> 09:05.874
- Don't shush me, Carly. Jesus.

09:06.844 --> 09:08.745
- You don't even want me here.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.142
- Well, does that surprise you?

09:11.112 --> 09:12.947
Why are you even back?

09:12.982 --> 09:15.048
- I'm just doing
what I need to do.

09:16.216 --> 09:18.117
- And what Dean? I
thought you were happy.

09:20.693 --> 09:21.285
- Yeah, well,

09:22.926 --> 09:27.060
not everything works out
the way we think it will.

09:27.095 --> 09:28.996
You've gotta roll
with the changes and

09:30.098 --> 09:31.229
make them work for you.

09:32.837 --> 09:34.199
So you said I can have my room?

09:36.203 --> 09:38.170
- Sound like Jimmy
what you just said.

09:38.205 --> 09:39.303
Is he talking for you now?

09:40.911 --> 09:43.142
Or have you got something
else going on, huh?

09:48.347 --> 09:49.247
- Fuck off.

12:09.290 --> 12:10.322
- Oh.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.292
- Carly.

12:15.131 --> 12:16.328
Jesus, Carly.

12:17.463 --> 12:19.298
Oh, god, I missed ya!

12:21.566 --> 12:23.434
You all right?

12:23.469 --> 12:25.469
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:25.504 --> 12:26.338
- Maura?

12:28.078 --> 12:28.978
- Oh, uh...

12:31.279 --> 12:32.784
- It's all right. You should go.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.346
Sorry,
we'll speak later.

12:40.222 --> 12:41.892
- Fancy taking over?

12:47.295 --> 12:50.032
- As long as you're up for
marginal disappointment.

12:51.332 --> 12:53.068
- Marginal?

12:53.103 --> 12:54.201
- Go on.

12:54.236 --> 12:55.037
- Yeah.

12:56.436 --> 12:58.007
All right, go inside
'cause I'm wearing heels.

13:23.628 --> 13:24.836
- I'm sorry.

13:26.499 --> 13:28.807
I know you only say
shit because you care.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.206
- Look.

13:32.241 --> 13:35.242
If you're in trouble or
if you need anything...

13:37.510 --> 13:40.511
Sorry, I don't... I know
I'm being hypocritical.

13:40.546 --> 13:42.282
I know I can't say shit, but...

13:45.353 --> 13:46.891
I thought you was done.

13:48.554 --> 13:49.388
- Seems not.

13:53.097 --> 13:54.294
I'm okay, though.

13:55.462 --> 13:56.263
I promise.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.298
- Look, I get it.

13:59.532 --> 14:02.368
That feeling of something
gnawing at you inside.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.537
Eatin' at ya, like
it's your fault.

14:09.509 --> 14:11.047
That, that guilt you feel.

14:13.381 --> 14:15.084
You've gotta fight through it.

14:20.619 --> 14:21.992
What happened?

14:28.935 --> 14:30.330
- Tuesday happened.

14:31.232 --> 14:33.399
Then Wednesday and
Thursday and fucking Friday

14:33.434 --> 14:35.335
and shit's gonna
happen every day.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.441
- Oh. New song.

14:43.609 --> 14:44.883
New mood, eh?

14:47.184 --> 14:48.579
You know, Maura missed ya.

14:49.381 --> 14:51.648
She got into some of the
makeup you left behind.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.618
Did that look that you
used to do before you left.

14:54.653 --> 14:56.521
- What, with the glitter?
- Mm-hm.

14:56.556 --> 14:58.193
- Oh, my god.
- Mm-hm.

14:58.228 --> 15:01.328
I looked
like a fucking bath mop.

15:01.363 --> 15:04.661
- Oh, uh-huh, so
did she.

15:04.696 --> 15:08.335
She is like the one-person Carly
fan club. She knows it all.

15:08.370 --> 15:11.437
Like, the clubs you've
been to, restaurants,

15:11.472 --> 15:13.373
the new labels you're wearing.

15:14.409 --> 15:16.376
- How?
- Facebook.

15:16.411 --> 15:19.346
- Yeah, she would spend
hours leafin' at pics of

15:19.381 --> 15:20.578
you and what's his name,

15:20.613 --> 15:22.580
sayin' how she'd get
her shit together.

15:24.089 --> 15:24.923
Like you.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.651
- Is that supposed
to make me feel bad?

15:29.292 --> 15:30.126
- No.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.560
- Good.

15:35.595 --> 15:38.365
Because what I do has nothing
to do with you, or Maura,

15:38.400 --> 15:39.300
or fucking anyone.

15:43.471 --> 15:44.503
- Well...

15:46.012 --> 15:48.408
Dean seemed perfect for ya.

15:48.443 --> 15:51.246
- We're all just faking it.

15:51.281 --> 15:52.577
One day at a time.

15:55.582 --> 15:57.450
- He didn't...

15:57.485 --> 15:58.319
Hit you?

16:03.623 --> 16:05.656
- We all think we've
only got one problem.

16:08.496 --> 16:11.233
And if we solve that,
it'll fix everything.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.635
There's no escape.

16:19.705 --> 16:21.342
And that's the fucking truth.

16:35.160 --> 16:40.163
throw their wind in my city

16:43.564 --> 16:48.468
wrong by light I know

16:48.503 --> 16:53.506
I am, I feel so lost

17:34.747 --> 17:37.847
- No client out of the site.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.123
Your rule.

17:40.522 --> 17:43.589
- Well, I guess I can say
when we can break it, can't I?

17:47.331 --> 17:48.429
He's a friend of mine.

17:49.696 --> 17:51.465
There's nothin' to worry about.

17:53.601 --> 17:58.406
He just has a couple
of peculiarities.

18:01.609 --> 18:02.641
- Oh, yeah?

18:03.875 --> 18:07.646
- My advice is
just to go with it.

18:11.421 --> 18:12.420
- Bet it fucking is.

18:16.690 --> 18:18.690
- You want to look?

18:24.368 --> 18:26.368
That's been ringing ever
since you gave it to me.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.112
What do you reckon?

18:39.944 --> 18:42.252
You need to get your
head in the game.

18:43.651 --> 18:45.387
This is a big one, you hear me?

18:49.360 --> 18:51.327
- Bet he says that
to all the girls.

18:51.362 --> 18:52.196
- That's funny.

18:53.562 --> 18:54.561
That was very funny.

18:57.731 --> 18:58.763
You wanna get out.

19:00.767 --> 19:03.306
And this guy, he
can get you there.

19:05.706 --> 19:06.738
If he likes ya.

19:11.646 --> 19:12.744
All of the juice.

19:13.714 --> 19:14.713
None of the squeeze.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.258
What a life that would be.

19:26.760 --> 19:27.858
Ask for Alexis.

19:35.406 --> 19:36.207
Hey.

19:39.707 --> 19:40.541
Be safe.

19:56.427 --> 19:57.558
- You for Alexis?

19:58.924 --> 20:00.297
- Is that you?

20:03.764 --> 20:05.269
- Can take you to her, though.

20:07.031 --> 20:07.832
If you want.

20:30.824 --> 20:31.889
There she is.

20:35.763 --> 20:36.762
Alexis.

20:38.832 --> 20:40.865
She's beautiful, isn't she?

20:45.938 --> 20:47.311
You want to leave?

20:52.945 --> 20:53.944
- No.

20:56.619 --> 20:57.783
- I used to hate them.

20:59.457 --> 21:00.819
Made my skin crawl, but,

21:02.361 --> 21:03.327
she's special.

21:13.636 --> 21:14.866
Cast a spell on me.

21:18.707 --> 21:22.709
She'll do the same to you
if you're not careful.

21:30.356 --> 21:31.850
- She's beautiful.

21:34.558 --> 21:35.953
You got any more?

21:36.956 --> 21:37.856
- Just her.

21:55.942 --> 21:57.645
Do you like to dance?

22:22.969 --> 22:26.839
you really know

22:26.874 --> 22:30.942
now, feeling now

22:30.977 --> 22:33.846
- What do you think
of instruction?

22:33.881 --> 22:35.485
Is it crass?

22:35.520 --> 22:39.423
up in our feelings

22:42.956 --> 22:45.055
- It depends.
- On what?

22:46.927 --> 22:48.993
Intention.

22:49.028 --> 22:49.961
- What's mine?

22:51.899 --> 22:54.163
Control.

22:54.198 --> 22:54.999
- Freedom.

23:10.115 --> 23:10.949
- Tell me.

23:16.759 --> 23:17.659
How's that?

23:18.728 --> 23:19.562
Tell me.

23:21.995 --> 23:22.994
- Go higher.

23:27.704 --> 23:29.066
- Shows connection.

23:30.674 --> 23:31.508
Trust.

23:33.072 --> 23:37.173
The willingness to find
ecstasy in the moment.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.747
Your partner is like a tool.

23:48.791 --> 23:49.625
Use me.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.090
Use me to get what you want.

23:54.060 --> 23:55.059
Use me.

26:00.120 --> 26:03.022
- Listen, I know you
don't wanna hear it,

26:03.057 --> 26:05.189
but this is what happens
when you trust people.

26:07.094 --> 26:08.126
Right, Simone?

26:09.228 --> 26:10.931
Are you listening?

26:10.966 --> 26:12.196
- It's not worth calling
scum like that people,

26:12.231 --> 26:14.033
if you ask me.

26:14.068 --> 26:15.100
- Oh, morning, Carly.

26:16.103 --> 26:19.005
I was just saying this
is why we have the rules.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.040
So you girls don't
bear the brunt of it.

26:33.791 --> 26:34.625
Carly.

26:50.236 --> 26:52.676
These girls look up to you.

26:57.144 --> 27:00.651
Oh, love.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.246
Go sort yourself out.

27:29.913 --> 27:31.176
Why's she back?

27:32.113 --> 27:33.948
Has she said anything?

27:33.983 --> 27:36.313
- Why does anyone come back?

28:08.281 --> 28:09.313
I'll go.

28:14.386 --> 28:16.760
- She can't bring that
shit here. Not again.

28:31.876 --> 28:32.710
- You okay?

28:38.377 --> 28:39.409
Can I come in?

28:40.313 --> 28:42.214
- No, just give me a sec.

28:46.319 --> 28:49.826
- All right, I'll be
here whenever you need.

29:00.366 --> 29:01.398
Oh, babe.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.781
You can't keep
doing this, Carly.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.277
- No, it's not that.

29:14.050 --> 29:15.181
I just feel sick.

29:24.995 --> 29:27.457
I know I said he hurt
me earlier but...

29:30.066 --> 29:30.900
He didn't.

29:34.301 --> 29:35.399
Dean's a good man.

29:37.304 --> 29:38.138
- Why?

29:41.110 --> 29:43.011
- It's easier than
admitting the truth.

29:44.113 --> 29:45.310
- And what is the truth?

29:49.052 --> 29:50.788
Carly, you need to
talk to someone.

29:54.585 --> 29:56.453
- I've got it under control.

29:56.488 --> 29:57.828
- Yeah, by what definition?

30:00.459 --> 30:02.866
You know, this isn't
your only option.

30:04.034 --> 30:04.967
There are other
places you can go.

30:05.002 --> 30:06.529
- Yeah and how do you know that?

30:12.471 --> 30:14.141
Could you get me
a towel, please?

30:17.982 --> 30:18.816
- Yeah.

32:26.440 --> 32:30.343
you really know

32:30.378 --> 32:33.511
now, feeling now

32:33.546 --> 32:38.549
to say about love

32:40.157 --> 32:42.454
up in our feelings

32:52.532 --> 32:55.170
- Carly, Carly, Carly.

32:55.205 --> 32:56.006
Work?

32:57.570 --> 32:59.471
Carly, we good, yeah?

32:59.506 --> 33:02.738
I wanna introduce
you to someone.

33:02.773 --> 33:03.607
Carly.

33:14.356 --> 33:18.688
to get lost tonight

33:22.364 --> 33:26.762
you love me like

33:30.372 --> 33:34.737
to get lost tonight

33:38.347 --> 33:42.679
you love me like

33:52.592 --> 33:54.130
- Hi.

33:54.165 --> 33:54.757
Um...

33:58.301 --> 34:00.400
Jimmy said you was into that.

34:01.469 --> 34:06.241
You can go to the bathroom to
sort yourself out if you want.

34:06.643 --> 34:07.770
- No, I'm fine.

34:11.347 --> 34:12.610
- Or the light?

34:13.512 --> 34:18.517
If you've got a headache.

34:18.552 --> 34:20.552
Lindsey used to get
headaches all the time.

34:24.723 --> 34:26.690
She used to sit in a dark
room till they passed.

34:30.432 --> 34:31.233
Prick.

34:32.731 --> 34:33.697
He'll tell ya.

34:34.898 --> 34:37.338
I caught her with her boss.

34:38.770 --> 34:39.604
Jesus.

34:42.675 --> 34:43.641
I just need...

34:46.547 --> 34:49.218
I just need to forget, you know?

34:54.192 --> 34:55.290
Are you okay?

34:56.821 --> 34:57.754
- I'm fine.

35:00.693 --> 35:03.199
That was a nice thing you did.

35:04.697 --> 35:06.334
- It's no bother.

35:08.602 --> 35:09.898
- No.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.834
That was really lovely.

35:14.179 --> 35:16.410
- What are friends for, eh?

35:20.548 --> 35:23.153
dance and don't say

35:23.188 --> 35:25.287
- Your boss, Jim, he-

35:25.322 --> 35:26.453
- He's not my boss.

35:29.557 --> 35:31.260
- He said it was

35:32.527 --> 35:33.625
gonna be 100?

35:43.670 --> 35:46.308
- What did you come here for?

35:47.707 --> 35:50.708
Because I'm pretty sure it
wasn't to talk about business.

35:53.878 --> 35:54.712
- No.

35:56.287 --> 35:57.352
You're right.

36:01.358 --> 36:02.522
- Good answer.

36:07.793 --> 36:08.759
- Uh, do we...

36:10.268 --> 36:11.828
How does this work?

36:16.835 --> 36:18.835
- Any way that you want.

36:28.880 --> 36:31.914
You should look
after your body more.

36:33.621 --> 36:35.291
But men, they don't.

36:38.263 --> 36:39.427
- I just don't

36:40.925 --> 36:42.364
think about it.

36:48.537 --> 36:49.371
Oh, I...

36:50.275 --> 36:50.900
I think...

36:53.443 --> 36:54.508
You're right.

36:55.577 --> 36:57.005
Jesus.

37:31.712 --> 37:32.546
Shit.

37:33.945 --> 37:34.779
- Problem?

37:38.356 --> 37:40.521
- No, it was just...

37:40.556 --> 37:41.753
It was just a bit sharp.

37:47.431 --> 37:48.892
What is it?

37:50.995 --> 37:52.269
- Why are you scared?

38:00.708 --> 38:01.608
Look at me.

38:03.975 --> 38:04.809
- I am.

38:19.859 --> 38:21.925
You're, you're beautiful.

38:32.971 --> 38:35.070
- Well, you deserve a
beautiful woman like me.

38:37.448 --> 38:38.612
- I deserve...

38:40.143 --> 38:41.747
A woman like you.

39:14.551 --> 39:15.385
- Carly?

39:36.573 --> 39:37.902
What's going on?

39:42.073 --> 39:45.514
Will somebody talk to me?
What is going on here?

39:49.982 --> 39:52.147
Look, I'm really sorry, mate.

39:58.463 --> 40:01.189
I'll give you your
money back, all right?

40:01.224 --> 40:02.597
That's sorted.

40:04.667 --> 40:07.030
It's all right, it's all right.

41:13.769 --> 41:14.999
What?

41:16.871 --> 41:18.838
You need to check your attitude.

41:20.006 --> 41:22.006
Need to slow down and
listen for a minute.

41:23.581 --> 41:26.549
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you better fucking be.

41:26.584 --> 41:27.979
Nearly scared that
poor guy half to death.

41:28.014 --> 41:29.882
Thought he was
gonna turn you in.

41:31.248 --> 41:32.082
- I'm sorry.

41:37.155 --> 41:39.056
What did he say happened?

41:40.323 --> 41:41.498
That I grabbed him?

41:42.666 --> 41:44.061
- Look, I know
it's been a while,

41:45.636 --> 41:48.065
but we don't play
games here, Carly.

41:48.100 --> 41:48.901
All right, love?

41:54.106 --> 41:57.877
You're a nice girl, but
you're going through some shit

41:57.912 --> 41:59.043
that I can't help you with.

42:00.750 --> 42:02.684
And Jimmy certainly can't.

42:05.953 --> 42:09.119
We're all a bit messed up
here, if you hadn't noticed.

42:11.123 --> 42:14.091
Yeah. You're going
through some tough times.

42:15.798 --> 42:16.830
- I'll fix this, Val.

43:36.714 --> 43:38.274
Hail, Medusa.

43:46.251 --> 43:50.352
- You want her to find
out who she is, don't you?

43:52.323 --> 43:53.322
Yes.

43:56.228 --> 43:57.194
- It's time.

44:09.373 --> 44:11.274
You can feel it.

44:11.309 --> 44:12.341
- Yes.

45:50.342 --> 45:51.374
- Hello?

45:57.217 --> 45:59.085
We need to talk about
the other night.

46:06.897 --> 46:08.193
- He's been expecting you.

46:10.197 --> 46:11.031
- Is he here?

46:12.837 --> 46:13.462
- He was.

46:15.972 --> 46:17.301
- Well, how long's he gonna be?

46:27.918 --> 46:28.818
Where's Alexis?

46:29.513 --> 46:31.183
The snake.

46:31.218 --> 46:33.383
- She's around, I'm sure.

46:34.617 --> 46:36.254
Doin' her thang.

46:48.136 --> 46:50.939
- Are you some kind
of witch or something?

46:54.978 --> 46:56.879
- Some people deserve
a second chance.

46:59.477 --> 47:00.542
Don't you think?

47:08.090 --> 47:09.254
You should drink this.

47:12.424 --> 47:13.522
It's a snake in the grass.

47:15.559 --> 47:16.866
I thought appropriate.

47:21.532 --> 47:23.532
You think he gave you something.

47:27.439 --> 47:28.504
How are you feeling?

47:31.080 --> 47:31.914
- I'm fine.

47:33.951 --> 47:35.885
- But you're
experiencing changes.

47:37.185 --> 47:38.382
Senses.

47:39.286 --> 47:40.120
Movements.

47:41.420 --> 47:42.254
Needs.

47:45.358 --> 47:46.522
My advice?

47:48.526 --> 47:49.459
Go with it.

47:53.664 --> 47:57.500
Not for you, or just don't
like being told what to do?

48:00.109 --> 48:02.604
- Are you and your boyfriend
part of some cult or something?

48:02.639 --> 48:05.376
He's
not my boyfriend.

48:06.544 --> 48:09.347
He was chosen, but for
a different purpose.

48:14.486 --> 48:17.190
Men like him and Jimmy,

48:18.457 --> 48:19.357
they mean nothing.

48:21.328 --> 48:22.932
- Do you know him?
- Jimmy?

48:25.530 --> 48:27.530
Only insofar as his
relation to you.

48:33.439 --> 48:34.944
And how he'll be your first.

48:39.610 --> 48:40.510
- My first?

48:46.320 --> 48:47.352
- You should see it.

49:35.072 --> 49:39.074
He understood the steps
that needed to be taken.

49:40.506 --> 49:42.374
What it took to find

49:43.344 --> 49:44.178
the queen.

49:47.150 --> 49:47.984
He knew.

50:18.544 --> 50:21.215
That's not what I'm looking for.

50:22.218 --> 50:23.679
We're equal, though.

50:28.191 --> 50:29.685
Could be anywhere.

51:12.367 --> 51:13.729
- You don't leave the site.

51:15.370 --> 51:16.204
That's the deal.

51:17.173 --> 51:18.602
- You're the one that
fuckin' brought me here.

51:18.637 --> 51:19.471
- Not now.

51:21.508 --> 51:22.837
Not at bloody lunchtime.

51:24.742 --> 51:27.545
What'd you come here for?
Afternoon fuckin' tea?

51:28.680 --> 51:29.613
- I'll get the bus.

51:31.650 --> 51:33.452
- I'm not fuckin' around, Carly!

51:34.421 --> 51:35.387
I don't know if you can
see the vein throbbing

51:35.422 --> 51:37.324
in my fucking neck, but
I'm not happy right now.

51:37.359 --> 51:38.424
Get in the car.

51:40.923 --> 51:43.264
- You're gonna have to speak
to me with a bit more respect,

51:43.299 --> 51:45.365
if I'm gonna do anything.

51:46.434 --> 51:47.664
Okay, Carly.

51:48.535 --> 51:49.534
I think...

51:51.637 --> 51:54.374
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

51:55.410 --> 51:56.211
It's calm.

52:03.187 --> 52:03.812
- Apologize.

52:05.915 --> 52:06.749
- I'm sorry.

52:08.456 --> 52:10.324
We're friends, I'm...

52:11.492 --> 52:12.788
I shouldn't jump
on you like that.

52:12.823 --> 52:15.395
It's just that you being
here without me, it's,

52:16.761 --> 52:19.729
it's not the sort of
place that a girl like you

52:22.272 --> 52:23.502
should be alone.

52:23.537 --> 52:25.669
- You suddenly give
a shit about me.

52:25.704 --> 52:26.538
- Suddenly?

52:27.673 --> 52:28.738
I care for you.

52:32.414 --> 52:34.414
You were the one who
rang me, remember?

52:34.449 --> 52:35.844
- Yeah, to get my next fix.

52:39.454 --> 52:40.354
- And I was there.

52:42.688 --> 52:43.852
- He was trying to help me.

52:45.592 --> 52:46.426
- Who, him?

52:48.298 --> 52:49.825
Ah.

52:49.860 --> 52:50.661
Him.

52:52.533 --> 52:56.601
In my experience, if
someone wants something,

52:56.636 --> 52:58.834
I mean really craves it,

52:58.869 --> 53:01.441
they're gonna do whatever
they can to get it.

53:01.476 --> 53:03.839
Even if that means putting
themselves in the firing line,

53:03.874 --> 53:04.708
so to speak.

53:05.810 --> 53:06.842
Now, come on.

53:07.878 --> 53:09.680
Let's get you back to the site.

53:09.715 --> 53:10.978
I've spoken to Val.
She's worried about you.

53:11.013 --> 53:14.784
Look, we all are. But it's
okay, no one's judging.

53:14.819 --> 53:16.819
We're here for you.
Whatever you need.

53:18.394 --> 53:20.757
I get why you're feeling

53:21.760 --> 53:22.891
alone and all.

53:27.370 --> 53:28.204
I'm here.

53:29.603 --> 53:30.866
The girls, like I said.

53:33.002 --> 53:34.672
We can figure this thing out.

53:41.549 --> 53:42.515
- Okay.

53:42.550 --> 53:43.945
- Okay?

53:43.980 --> 53:44.814
Okay, good.

53:47.522 --> 53:49.621
Your carriage, madam.

53:58.434 --> 54:01.831
You came to me, remember?

54:01.866 --> 54:02.766
That means you listen.

54:06.035 --> 54:06.869
You obey.

54:09.676 --> 54:10.972
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

54:12.844 --> 54:14.613
You don't wanna wake the birds.

54:17.354 --> 54:18.815
- Jimmy, please.

54:18.850 --> 54:20.751
- "Please."

54:20.786 --> 54:21.620
"Please."

54:22.854 --> 54:24.887
Please yourself, you daft twat.

54:30.829 --> 54:33.368
- You don't have to do this.

54:34.899 --> 54:36.932
You don't have to do this.

54:36.967 --> 54:38.868
- I do.

54:44.513 --> 54:46.876
I bet you're not as tight
as you were last time.

54:49.518 --> 54:51.815
Carly, Carly, Carly,
Carly, my fallen angel.

54:52.752 --> 54:54.356
Let's give you back those wings.

54:55.557 --> 54:57.084
And maybe...

54:57.119 --> 54:59.790
Maybe you'll find your way back
to fuckin' heaven won't you?

54:59.825 --> 55:04.762
You filthy cunt.

55:07.734 --> 55:08.568
Carly.

55:20.450 --> 55:21.075
Carly.

57:47.696 --> 57:49.091
Carly?

57:49.126 --> 57:52.798
Look, I've been trying to get
a hold of you. Where are ya?

57:52.833 --> 57:54.096
Carly, it's me.

57:56.870 --> 57:58.540
- What you avoidin'?

57:59.576 --> 58:00.135
He wants ya.

58:01.611 --> 58:02.709
Wants to support ya.

58:03.646 --> 58:04.975
- I'm not avoiding anything.

58:05.010 --> 58:06.042
- Yeah.

58:06.946 --> 58:07.780
Sure.

58:10.081 --> 58:10.915
Whatever.

58:14.283 --> 58:15.722
You know, I don't get it.

58:17.286 --> 58:19.726
When you left.
- Yeah, I know, I was happy.

58:22.258 --> 58:23.961
I didn't know what that meant.

58:25.195 --> 58:26.029
Clearly.

58:28.066 --> 58:28.900
- So this is it?

58:31.707 --> 58:32.871
This is your life now?

58:37.977 --> 58:38.811
- No.

58:41.178 --> 58:42.650
Now I'm something better.

58:59.966 --> 59:02.197
You know, you can't hide this.

59:05.334 --> 59:06.267
Believe me.

59:15.179 --> 59:16.211
I tried.

59:20.250 --> 59:21.788
You know that shame?

59:24.826 --> 59:26.221
That you're feeling?

59:28.291 --> 59:30.324
It just shows your
willingness to change.

59:36.640 --> 59:39.201
I could introduce
you to someone.

59:41.106 --> 59:44.272
Give you an alternative
to all of this

59:45.374 --> 59:46.208
hiding.

59:54.757 --> 59:56.020
- I'm not like you.

1:00:02.061 --> 1:00:02.895
- Sure.

1:00:45.335 --> 1:00:47.676
Oh! You smell nice.

1:00:47.711 --> 1:00:50.173
- It's Carcon. Ian bought it me.

1:00:53.442 --> 1:00:55.211
- Nah, he buys it all the girls.

1:00:56.214 --> 1:00:57.752
- No, don't say that.

1:00:59.019 --> 1:01:02.724
Probably 'cause he
wanted to impress you.

1:01:02.759 --> 1:01:06.255
You're the type of
girl worth impressing.

1:01:06.290 --> 1:01:07.861
- Carl.

1:01:07.896 --> 1:01:08.895
Sweet of ya.

1:01:11.900 --> 1:01:13.262
- You're so beautiful, Maura.

1:01:15.365 --> 1:01:17.200
Your hair and your,

1:01:18.071 --> 1:01:19.268
your skin and...

1:01:22.174 --> 1:01:23.008
Your smile.

1:01:26.915 --> 1:01:28.211
- What? Am I embarrassing you?

1:01:30.314 --> 1:01:35.317
- No.

1:01:37.354 --> 1:01:38.155
A little bit.

1:01:41.490 --> 1:01:43.391
- Well, you shouldn't
be embarrassed.

1:01:44.999 --> 1:01:46.097
I'm just stating facts.

1:01:58.243 --> 1:02:01.112
We don't deserve
you here, Maura.

1:02:03.853 --> 1:02:05.149
- Are you all right, Carl?

1:02:07.791 --> 1:02:10.121
Since you got here, you've
just been different.

1:02:12.224 --> 1:02:14.125
No, I'm fine.

1:02:18.164 --> 1:02:20.230
- You sound like
Alexis, you know.

1:02:20.265 --> 1:02:23.068
This girl that stayed
here for a bit.

1:02:23.103 --> 1:02:24.498
Only a month, if that.

1:02:28.207 --> 1:02:30.108
Yeah, she actually
stayed in your van.

1:02:37.953 --> 1:02:39.414
It's like she knew ya.

1:02:42.254 --> 1:02:44.793
- About me?
- Well, like she wanted to.

1:02:57.335 --> 1:02:58.136
Look.

1:03:14.319 --> 1:03:15.384
You know her?

1:03:19.929 --> 1:03:20.554
- No.

1:03:25.561 --> 1:03:30.201
- Well, like I said, she
didn't stay very long, so...

1:03:31.336 --> 1:03:33.006
- Why you here, Maura?

1:03:35.175 --> 1:03:37.505
How's it make you feel
when someone hits you?

1:03:41.181 --> 1:03:42.444
- I don't know.

1:03:44.888 --> 1:03:45.513
Not good.

1:03:49.222 --> 1:03:50.221
- Worthless?

1:03:52.423 --> 1:03:56.128
- The fact that someone
could just use me.

1:03:59.199 --> 1:04:00.066
And then...

1:04:08.505 --> 1:04:11.539
- Well, at least we've
learned a lesson.

1:04:15.314 --> 1:04:17.248
You can't trust anyone.

1:04:22.321 --> 1:04:24.618
There are snakes in the grass.

1:04:30.065 --> 1:04:31.328
What would you do

1:04:33.068 --> 1:04:35.464
if you could do anything
to the guy who hurt you?

1:05:22.579 --> 1:05:24.480
you really know

1:05:26.550 --> 1:05:30.222
now, feeling now

1:05:30.257 --> 1:05:31.091
- You may.

1:05:33.557 --> 1:05:36.063
- Where is she? The other one.

1:05:37.495 --> 1:05:38.527
- What?

1:05:40.498 --> 1:05:42.531
- Just, she, uh...

1:05:42.566 --> 1:05:43.697
Owes me, is all.

1:05:45.140 --> 1:05:45.974
- Come on.

1:05:48.275 --> 1:05:51.111
Let me make you comfortable.

1:05:58.615 --> 1:06:02.353
- So, I feel like
you're into instruction.

1:06:04.192 --> 1:06:05.994
Telling things what to do.

1:06:07.690 --> 1:06:11.527
Guess you're into that.

1:06:11.562 --> 1:06:14.563
- Lie down and take
your clothes off.

1:06:14.598 --> 1:06:16.598
- It's a guess.

1:06:16.633 --> 1:06:20.437
Not that I'm doing it.

1:06:20.472 --> 1:06:21.306
Sit.

1:06:31.813 --> 1:06:32.647
- Oh?

1:06:36.554 --> 1:06:38.059
- Maura told me all about you.

1:06:40.789 --> 1:06:41.722
How strong you are.

1:06:43.627 --> 1:06:45.231
How in control.

1:06:46.432 --> 1:06:48.135
- I knew that bitch
was into that.

1:06:50.337 --> 1:06:52.403
- She said she'd
never been so wet.

1:06:53.802 --> 1:06:56.506
- You fucking hoes are
all the same, aren't ya?

1:07:02.085 --> 1:07:04.547
- Oh. Sorry.

1:07:04.582 --> 1:07:06.153
Did I go a bit hard?

1:07:06.188 --> 1:07:07.385
- Yeah, just a bit.

1:07:07.420 --> 1:07:10.685
- Sometimes I just get
carried away.

1:07:11.820 --> 1:07:13.028
It's okay.

1:07:15.362 --> 1:07:16.196
Relax.

1:07:19.597 --> 1:07:20.431
Enjoy it.

1:07:25.702 --> 1:07:28.076
Does that feel good, baby?

1:07:45.689 --> 1:07:47.524
Get off!
- What's that?

1:07:48.857 --> 1:07:49.691
- Fuck!

1:07:54.137 --> 1:07:57.138
Hey, I thought you'd
invite me 'cause you needed it.

1:07:57.173 --> 1:07:58.535
- You don't know what I need.
- Oh, yeah?

1:07:59.472 --> 1:08:01.439
Fucking bitch!

1:08:06.677 --> 1:08:10.580
Oh, fuck.

1:08:10.615 --> 1:08:12.450
- It's funny, isn't it?

1:08:12.485 --> 1:08:15.189
How you become a victim
of your own routine.

1:08:15.224 --> 1:08:16.124
- Fuck you.

1:08:16.885 --> 1:08:18.093
- How eloquent.

1:08:21.197 --> 1:08:23.593
Do you feel strong, baby?

1:08:25.663 --> 1:08:27.696
You feel special, baby?

1:08:31.933 --> 1:08:33.471
Do you feel wet?

1:08:57.926 --> 1:09:00.630
- You still wanna see
strength, little girl?

1:09:12.479 --> 1:09:14.182
Love?

1:09:14.217 --> 1:09:15.546
Can you hear me?

1:09:17.286 --> 1:09:18.879
- Do you think we should
call an ambulance?

1:09:18.914 --> 1:09:19.814
- What?

1:09:19.849 --> 1:09:22.289
No. Don't be so fucking stupid.

1:09:25.723 --> 1:09:26.755
Carl.

1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:31.727
Jesus Christ, Carly.

1:09:32.862 --> 1:09:34.895
What happened to you?

1:09:34.930 --> 1:09:37.700
- Where is he?

1:09:37.735 --> 1:09:40.835
- He left before I realized
anything was wrong.

1:09:40.870 --> 1:09:42.342
- What?

1:09:42.377 --> 1:09:43.211
What?

1:09:45.413 --> 1:09:46.709
I thought this was a break-in.

1:09:49.879 --> 1:09:51.351
You invited him?

1:09:51.386 --> 1:09:52.418
- It was my idea.

1:09:53.850 --> 1:09:55.652
- What do you mean
it was your idea?

1:09:56.853 --> 1:09:59.623
- These scumbags have
to be taught a lesson.

1:09:59.658 --> 1:10:00.789
- Well, it seems the only person

1:10:00.824 --> 1:10:03.198
who's got taught
something tonight was you!

1:10:04.366 --> 1:10:05.992
Now, I need to go
and find Jimmy,

1:10:06.027 --> 1:10:09.270
so he can find that psycho
before he finishes you off!

1:10:11.307 --> 1:10:12.900
- What the fuck did he do to ya?

1:10:18.908 --> 1:10:20.842
I think you took it a
bit far this time, Carl.

1:10:23.715 --> 1:10:27.882
- Well, deal with your own
fucking shit next time.

1:12:05.014 --> 1:12:06.486
- Carl!

1:12:06.521 --> 1:12:07.652
Carly.

1:12:26.607 --> 1:12:28.706
Carly, are you all right?

1:13:00.102 --> 1:13:05.039
Carl, I can't help you if you
don't tell me what's wrong.

1:13:07.582 --> 1:13:08.416
Carl.

1:13:32.475 --> 1:13:33.705
Carl.

1:13:33.740 --> 1:13:34.706
Carl!

1:13:34.741 --> 1:13:37.170
I said
leave it, Maura!

1:14:57.054 --> 1:14:58.086
- Hey, baby.

1:15:00.057 --> 1:15:01.122
You got nowhere to be?

1:15:01.991 --> 1:15:04.257
Hey, hey, where you
goin'? Hey, hey, hey.

1:15:08.637 --> 1:15:10.197
See, I knew you wanted to play.

1:15:16.205 --> 1:15:17.545
Show me your face.

1:15:20.946 --> 1:15:22.682
Oh, you fucking crazy bitch.

1:15:56.311 --> 1:15:57.145
- Carly?

1:15:59.215 --> 1:16:00.918
Carly, what the fuck?

1:16:02.152 --> 1:16:03.921
Carly, where the fuck you been?

1:16:06.288 --> 1:16:09.091
But I, I thought you were hurt.

1:16:13.999 --> 1:16:15.163
Where's Jimmy?

1:16:17.101 --> 1:16:18.969
- I've got something
to show you.

1:16:45.734 --> 1:16:46.700
People like that...

1:16:53.236 --> 1:16:54.268
They're nothing.

1:16:57.174 --> 1:16:58.910
They use you.

1:16:58.945 --> 1:17:00.241
They make money.

1:17:01.277 --> 1:17:02.342
Then that's it.

1:17:07.448 --> 1:17:09.184
They're don't give
a shit about you.

1:17:11.254 --> 1:17:13.188
You're not special or important.

1:17:15.126 --> 1:17:16.323
You're disposable.

1:17:19.295 --> 1:17:21.097
They do whatever
the fuck they want.

1:17:32.946 --> 1:17:34.209
They'll eat you alive, Maura.

1:17:37.247 --> 1:17:38.312
Do you understand?

1:17:40.723 --> 1:17:42.217
- What the fuck have you done?

1:17:43.891 --> 1:17:45.055
- Well, do you wanna be
a part of this world?

1:18:04.241 --> 1:18:05.075
- I can't.

1:18:06.848 --> 1:18:08.012
I've gotta go.

1:18:26.197 --> 1:18:27.328
- They found Jimmy's body.

1:18:33.941 --> 1:18:35.501
What did you do, Carly?

1:18:35.536 --> 1:18:37.811
- Figured my life out, Val.

1:18:37.846 --> 1:18:41.177
It doesn't matter
what he did or didn't do.

1:18:41.212 --> 1:18:43.014
No one deserves that.

1:18:43.049 --> 1:18:44.246
- "Deserves"?

1:18:47.020 --> 1:18:48.349
And you're the judge of that?

1:18:50.221 --> 1:18:52.188
- All the police have
been asking questions.

1:18:52.223 --> 1:18:54.289
They're gonna be
watching this place.

1:18:54.324 --> 1:18:55.158
- Will they?

1:19:02.431 --> 1:19:04.266
I'm just thinking
about us girls.

1:19:06.303 --> 1:19:08.006
All the shit that
you promised us.

1:19:10.340 --> 1:19:13.176
- What you talkin' about, hm?

1:19:17.083 --> 1:19:19.281
- How many old men's
dicks did we have to suck?

1:19:24.585 --> 1:19:25.419
Don't.

1:19:27.357 --> 1:19:28.389
I'll go.

1:19:34.870 --> 1:19:35.495
- Carly!

1:19:36.399 --> 1:19:37.871
Carly!

1:19:37.906 --> 1:19:39.268
Carly, open this...

1:19:39.303 --> 1:19:40.841
Don't be stupid!

1:19:47.080 --> 1:19:47.914
- Carly.

1:19:49.852 --> 1:19:51.214
Carly, what's happening?

1:19:51.249 --> 1:19:52.820
I don't understand.

1:19:54.252 --> 1:19:55.482
No, don't! Don't!

1:19:55.517 --> 1:19:56.351
- Or?

1:19:58.586 --> 1:19:59.420
- Don't.

1:20:01.930 --> 1:20:03.094
Did you do that to him?

1:20:07.133 --> 1:20:08.462
He had it coming.

1:20:09.938 --> 1:20:10.838
- Bullshit.

1:20:12.941 --> 1:20:14.435
- I won't try to convince you.

1:20:15.603 --> 1:20:17.570
You're the one pointing
the knife at me.

1:20:22.478 --> 1:20:23.444
I had a weakness.

1:20:26.251 --> 1:20:27.382
Then I found something new.

1:20:30.057 --> 1:20:31.287
- Please don't make me.

1:20:34.930 --> 1:20:35.555
- Make you?

1:20:37.262 --> 1:20:40.560
- Oh, you are sick in
the fucking head, Carly.

1:20:41.937 --> 1:20:45.433
- Do you remember
when we used to talk?

1:20:45.468 --> 1:20:49.536
About what we'd do when
we found the perfect man?

1:20:54.114 --> 1:20:55.608
Do you remember that?

1:21:00.450 --> 1:21:01.955
Do you believe it?

1:21:03.519 --> 1:21:07.092
'Cause I've finally taken
responsibility over my own life.

1:21:07.127 --> 1:21:09.523
- You have no idea
what that even means.

1:21:15.663 --> 1:21:19.533
- I don't think anyone
knows what they want.

1:21:20.302 --> 1:21:24.373
And sometimes your hand
just has to be forced.

1:21:26.014 --> 1:21:26.639
- No.

1:21:29.512 --> 1:21:31.017
- Carly!

1:21:31.052 --> 1:21:33.987
- I've got venom
inside me, Simone.

1:21:37.454 --> 1:21:39.421
And I want you to feel it.

1:21:43.163 --> 1:21:43.997
- Fuck!

1:22:23.731 --> 1:22:25.368
- I see you've been shedding.

1:22:28.010 --> 1:22:29.636
The power's always
been within you.

1:22:34.214 --> 1:22:35.510
- You came.

1:22:37.250 --> 1:22:39.987
- For my sister,
I'd do anything.

1:22:41.584 --> 1:22:42.484
And so would they.

1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:02.207
- Carly, this is insane.

1:23:09.546 --> 1:23:10.380
- I do.

1:23:13.286 --> 1:23:15.385
- And she knows the
spirit that fuels her?

1:23:16.421 --> 1:23:17.255
- She will.

1:23:18.588 --> 1:23:20.489
Come.

1:23:20.524 --> 1:23:22.656
Your final challenge
is in front of you.

1:23:25.364 --> 1:23:26.198
- Carly.

1:23:27.399 --> 1:23:28.530
Please let us go.

1:23:33.702 --> 1:23:34.569
- You can go.

1:23:48.288 --> 1:23:50.618
I don't know why
you're surprised, Val.

1:23:52.622 --> 1:23:53.786
You made me like this.

1:24:05.503 --> 1:24:09.142
I don't wanna hurt you.

1:24:09.177 --> 1:24:09.802
Trust me.

1:24:47.743 --> 1:24:49.611
- You've returned, sister.

1:24:50.845 --> 1:24:52.449
Our mortal queen.

1:25:14.572 --> 1:25:15.637
Rise, Medusa!

1:25:16.739 --> 1:25:18.442
Our serpent queen.
