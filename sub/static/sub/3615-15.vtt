WEBVTT

00:04.499 --> 00:06.567
Okay, that
should be good.

00:06.667 --> 00:07.901
GRAMS:
I'm thinking more

00:08.000 --> 00:08.984
to the left.

00:09.084 --> 00:12.442
Uh, is this the biggest arch
you could get?

00:12.542 --> 00:12.942
(<i>groans</i>)

00:13.042 --> 00:15.067
Without opening
a fast-food franchise, yeah.

00:15.167 --> 00:18.692
Well, just remember,
if love is the quest,

00:18.792 --> 00:20.859
then marriage is the conquest.

00:20.959 --> 00:22.817
This place
must feel like...

00:22.917 --> 00:23.901
victory.

00:24.001 --> 00:26.901
And here I thought weddings
were supposed to be romantic.

00:27.001 --> 00:28.067
Oh, my dear sweet child.

00:28.167 --> 00:29.192
Better listen to Grams, Phoebe.

00:29.292 --> 00:31.026
I mean, you could always
calculate her age

00:31.126 --> 00:33.109
by the number of rings
on her fingers.

00:33.209 --> 00:34.667
(<i>laughs</i>)

00:35.625 --> 00:39.399
All right,
wedding arch is done.

00:39.499 --> 00:40.609
The next thing to do

00:40.709 --> 00:42.817
(<i>yawning</i>):
on the to-do list is...

00:42.917 --> 00:43.609
PHOEBE:
Sleep.

00:43.709 --> 00:45.442
You've been yawning all day.

00:45.542 --> 00:46.151
PRUE:
Try all week.

00:46.251 --> 00:48.609
It's this reoccurring dream
I keep having;

00:48.709 --> 00:49.775
it's keeping me awake.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.026
Really?
What's in the dream?

00:52.126 --> 00:53.318
PRUE:
Well, uh...

00:53.418 --> 00:54.399
there's this biker guy,

00:54.499 --> 00:57.400
and he's kind of cute
and kind of dangerous.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.775
Sounds kind of yummy.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.692
(<i>footsteps running
 down stairs</i>)

01:00.792 --> 01:03.483
GRAMS:
Piper, sweetie. Well?

01:03.583 --> 01:04.941
What do you think?

01:05.042 --> 01:06.567
PIPER:
It's... it's...

01:06.667 --> 01:07.442
it's beautiful.

01:07.542 --> 01:09.775
PHOEBE:
Yeah, and the best
part about it is...

01:09.875 --> 01:11.192
it's finally happening.

01:11.292 --> 01:12.442
(<i>sighs</i>)

01:12.542 --> 01:16.276
Flowers and bows
and... Grams.

01:16.376 --> 01:17.942
The only thing
missing is...

01:18.042 --> 01:20.859
Mom.

01:20.959 --> 01:23.817
Grams, are you sure
that you can't do...

01:23.917 --> 01:24.483
GRAMS:
No, nothing.

01:24.583 --> 01:27.442
I'm only here because
you need a high priestess.

01:27.542 --> 01:29.734
They want me back
by the witching hour tomorrow.

01:29.834 --> 01:32.209
I thought maybe this could help.

01:35.667 --> 01:36.901
You okay?

01:37.001 --> 01:37.901
Yeah, I just...

01:38.001 --> 01:38.567
I can't believe how

01:38.667 --> 01:41.442
close I came to sabotaging
my own wedding.

01:41.542 --> 01:42.399
What do you mean?

01:42.499 --> 01:45.609
Well, with the demons
and the false starts

01:45.709 --> 01:47.901
and Them, I...
you know, I told myself

01:48.001 --> 01:49.775
if one more thing
went wrong,

01:49.875 --> 01:50.984
then it just maybe
wasn't meant to be.

01:51.084 --> 01:52.276
GRAMS:
Oh, darling,
there's no need

01:52.376 --> 01:54.817
to think that way--
I mean, you made it.

01:54.917 --> 01:56.650
Yeah, and I will
personally butt-kick

01:56.750 --> 02:00.318
(<i>yawns</i>):
any demon who tries
to ruin it for you.

02:00.418 --> 02:02.817
Not if you're asleep you won't.
Come on, I'm tucking you in.

02:02.917 --> 02:04.399
Sweet dreams.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.151
I...
Bye.

02:07.251 --> 02:09.399
GRAMS:
I'll see you tomorrow,

02:09.499 --> 02:12.650
at 4:00, Mrs. Halliwell.

02:12.750 --> 02:17.499
The women <i>keep</i> their names
in this family.

02:43.499 --> 02:44.399
(<i>billiard balls clack</i>)

02:44.499 --> 02:45.859
That's a lucky shot.

02:45.959 --> 02:47.359
MAN:
Ain't no lucky shot.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.709
PRUE:
Uh-huh.

02:50.792 --> 02:52.276
(<i>ball rattles into pocket</i>)

02:52.376 --> 02:56.167
The more I play,
the luckier I get.

02:58.709 --> 03:00.567
All right.

03:00.667 --> 03:01.399
(<i>men whoop</i>)

03:01.499 --> 03:04.318
So that would be, uh...

03:04.418 --> 03:07.400
20 bucks that you owe me.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.359
I never agreed to no bet.

03:09.459 --> 03:11.692
The rules of the house say
loser pays 20 bucks.

03:11.792 --> 03:16.399
Maybe you want me to
take you out front and
teach you those rules?

03:16.499 --> 03:20.817
(<i>laughs</i>):
All right.

03:20.917 --> 03:22.792
Easy.

03:24.542 --> 03:26.399
Thank you.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.399
So, um...

03:28.499 --> 03:29.399
I suppose that you...

03:29.499 --> 03:32.399
want something
for helping me?

03:32.499 --> 03:33.151
You could say that.

03:33.251 --> 03:35.942
Well, you'll have
to win it just like
the rest of 'em.

03:36.042 --> 03:37.318
Maybe I should just take it.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.692
Maybe you should
leave me alone.

03:39.792 --> 03:41.692
You have no idea who
you're dealing with.

03:41.792 --> 03:43.667
Maybe you should show me.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.399
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.

03:48.499 --> 03:51.067
Yeah, well, so am I,
'cause now I have to go.

03:51.167 --> 03:52.399
Well, I want you to stay.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.359
Yeah, I know.

03:54.459 --> 03:56.399
You know that I can't,
right? I have...

03:56.499 --> 03:57.204
Responsibilities. Right.

03:57.214 --> 03:59.109
That's what you say every night,
then you cut out.

03:59.209 --> 04:04.483
TJ, I would love to
leave my responsible
half behind, but...

04:04.583 --> 04:05.984
I can't.

04:06.084 --> 04:06.567
You can.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.901
What are you gonna miss
tomorrow, work?

04:09.001 --> 04:09.400
Blow it off.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.109
There's a freedom that comes
with making your own choices.

04:13.209 --> 04:15.276
I know.

04:15.376 --> 04:16.399
Yeah...

04:16.499 --> 04:20.500
and I want to know what
that's like, but...

04:22.834 --> 04:24.609
(<i>rock music playing</i>)

04:24.709 --> 04:27.499
The least you could do
is tell me your name.

04:37.667 --> 04:38.709
Hey!

04:39.251 --> 04:39.942
You got my money?

04:40.042 --> 04:41.399
Hey, you have a good memory.

04:41.499 --> 04:44.775
(<i>laughs</i>):
Yeah. Yeah.

04:44.875 --> 04:46.901
Maybe I'll just take
it out in trade, huh?

04:47.001 --> 04:48.499
Come here.

04:49.709 --> 04:50.583
(<i>both grunt</i>)

04:58.334 --> 05:01.499
No...
I don't want to go again.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.483
(<i>laughing</i>)

06:23.583 --> 06:26.192
Was that just giggling I heard?

06:26.292 --> 06:28.399
Yes, I am guilty of giggling,
and I am guilty

06:28.499 --> 06:32.318
of being happier than
any previous moment in my life.

06:32.418 --> 06:34.400
Piper, it's your wedding day!

06:34.500 --> 06:35.442
I know.

06:35.542 --> 06:38.276
(<i>giggles</i>):
Here comes the bridesmaid!

06:41.499 --> 06:43.234
Prue! Come play!

06:43.334 --> 06:44.792
Uh-oh.

06:45.251 --> 06:45.942
Hey!

06:46.042 --> 06:48.399
Uh-oh, another
bad dream?

06:48.499 --> 06:48.870
Yeah.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.984
I was still
in that biker bar, but...

06:52.084 --> 06:54.984
this time I was attacked
by a big galoot.

06:55.084 --> 06:56.609
A galoot? What is that?

06:56.709 --> 06:58.067
You-you fought a demon

06:58.167 --> 06:58.620
in your sleep?

06:58.630 --> 07:00.567
If I'm gonna have
to vanquish a demon

07:00.667 --> 07:01.329
in my wedding dress,

07:01.339 --> 07:03.399
just tell me,
because if so, then...

07:03.499 --> 07:04.442
Hey..

07:04.542 --> 07:08.151
All right...
he was not a demon, right?

07:08.251 --> 07:09.400
He was just a big rude guy.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.151
And it was just in her dreams,
honey.

07:11.251 --> 07:12.984
Yeah, and the only thing
I need to vanquish him

07:13.084 --> 07:15.276
is a potion called coffee.

07:15.376 --> 07:16.109
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

07:16.209 --> 07:17.817
Ah, that must be the flowers.

07:17.917 --> 07:21.650
Um, okay, you just relax.
No worrying.

07:21.750 --> 07:22.692
And eat your breakfast,

07:22.792 --> 07:23.609
and then I will have

07:23.709 --> 07:26.499
a hot bubble bath
waiting for you.

07:27.334 --> 07:29.399
Are you sure there's
nothing witchy going on?

07:29.499 --> 07:31.126
I'm positive.

07:34.709 --> 07:36.583

07:49.126 --> 07:50.318
MAN:
Is that her?

07:50.418 --> 07:52.525
Is that the woman
you were with last night?

07:52.625 --> 07:55.859
Yeah. So what?

07:55.959 --> 07:56.609
So what's her name?

07:56.709 --> 07:59.483
(<i>laughs</i>):
I don't know.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.609
Ah, you stick your tongue
down her throat,

08:01.709 --> 08:03.026
but you don't know her name.

08:03.126 --> 08:03.787
Is that against the law?

08:03.797 --> 08:05.984
Look, I can appreciate you
trying to protect

08:06.084 --> 08:08.026
your girlfriend
from murder charges.

08:08.126 --> 08:09.399
She's no murderer.

08:09.499 --> 08:11.067
You sure about that, son?

08:11.167 --> 08:12.775
DETECTIVE:
You know something?

08:12.875 --> 08:15.276
I know what happened;
saw it with my own eyes.

08:15.376 --> 08:16.399
Did you get a look
at the killer?

08:16.499 --> 08:20.499
I'm looking at
her right now.

08:24.376 --> 08:27.901
PHOEBE:
Check out what I found
 in the attic.

08:28.001 --> 08:29.399
I hope it's
something old,

08:29.499 --> 08:31.650
'cause we already
have new, borrowed
and blue covered.

08:31.750 --> 08:35.442
Is Melinda Warren's
blessing cup old enough?

08:35.542 --> 08:37.399
That is very cool.

08:37.499 --> 08:39.399
Yeah, what could be better
than to give Piper

08:39.499 --> 08:42.109
the actual cup that
our favorite ancestor

08:42.208 --> 08:43.399
drank from at her wedding?

08:43.499 --> 08:44.984
Hmm, all right, I can
check that off.

08:45.084 --> 08:49.234
Now all I need is
help moving the,
uh, buffet table.

08:49.334 --> 08:49.859
Um...

08:49.959 --> 08:52.399
maybe we should wait
until Cole gets here.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.525
He should be
here any minute.

08:54.625 --> 08:56.292
You're kidding, right?

08:56.917 --> 08:59.692
No. You knew he was coming
to the wedding.

08:59.792 --> 09:01.399
Yeah, to the wedding, Phoebe,

09:01.499 --> 09:04.692
but the moments leading up to it
belong to family.

09:04.792 --> 09:07.399
And I'm sorry,
but Cole is not

09:07.499 --> 09:08.359
family, okay?

09:08.459 --> 09:10.399
He is still a demon.

09:10.499 --> 09:12.609
And I don't think Piper needs
a demon...

It is bad luck
to see the bride's dress

09:16.499 --> 09:17.775
before the wedding!

09:17.875 --> 09:19.817
But you're not even wearing
your dress.

09:19.917 --> 09:23.399
The same rule applies
to the bride's... curlers!

you're here.

Yeah, I'm just looking
for a place to change.

09:30.418 --> 09:33.192
Uh, what's with the robe?

09:33.292 --> 09:34.734
Oh, it's, uh...

09:34.834 --> 09:36.109
my formal whitelighter wear.

09:36.209 --> 09:39.399
Um, yeah, I-I hope
you don't mind,

09:39.499 --> 09:41.399
but we sort of decided
that you should

09:41.499 --> 09:43.359
be a little bit more
traditional,

09:43.459 --> 09:45.542
so we rented you a tux.

09:46.042 --> 09:47.442
Anybody home?

09:47.542 --> 09:49.609
Daddy!

you two have a lot

to share,

so I'll just take you
down... (<i>gasps</i>)

Uh... just a, uh...

10:09.792 --> 10:11.442
bad dizzy spell.

10:11.542 --> 10:14.109
I've been getting
them ever since
those dreams began.

10:14.209 --> 10:16.026
What dreams?
PRUE:
Oh, you know,

10:16.126 --> 10:19.151
these dreams to...
uh...

10:19.251 --> 10:20.734
you know,
it's uh...

10:20.834 --> 10:22.775
nothing.
PHOEBE:
Yeah, certainly

10:22.875 --> 10:25.192
nothing to worry about.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.775
Okay, you two, follow me.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.399
You just sit
there and relax.

10:29.499 --> 10:31.459
I'll be right back.

10:39.875 --> 10:43.209
PHOEBE:
Get dressed and no fighting.

10:48.334 --> 10:50.276
So, you rented a tux,
huh?

10:50.376 --> 10:54.399
I thought for sure
you'd be wearing one
of those long robes

10:54.499 --> 10:56.984
all you whitelighters
love so much.

10:57.084 --> 11:00.499
No, I decided to go
a little more
traditional.

11:04.792 --> 11:07.234
Prue...

11:07.334 --> 11:09.399
Okay, we've got everyone
convinced

11:09.499 --> 11:11.901
that we have things
under control.

11:12.001 --> 11:15.109
Now you have to convince me.

11:15.209 --> 11:16.942
I can't do that.

11:17.042 --> 11:17.650
I know.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.276
What are you feeling?

11:20.376 --> 11:21.400
Tired. All the time.

11:21.500 --> 11:26.234
I mean, when I fall asleep,
my dreams are so real

11:26.334 --> 11:27.901
that they don't allow
me any rest.

11:28.001 --> 11:31.483
It's like I'm awake
24 hours a day.

11:31.583 --> 11:34.399
Is the Dream Sorcerer back?

11:34.499 --> 11:36.859
I don't think so, but I'm
not ruling anything out.

11:36.959 --> 11:40.399
Well, remember what Piper said--
if one more thing goes wrong,

11:40.499 --> 11:42.400
she was going to call off
this wedding.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.650
No, we can't let that happen.

11:43.750 --> 11:48.359
Okay, why don't you let me
handle this almighty to-do list?

11:48.459 --> 11:50.399
And you go upstairs
and get some rest.

11:50.499 --> 11:52.359
Don't sleep--

11:52.459 --> 11:54.399
just rest.

11:54.499 --> 11:55.400
Okay.

11:55.500 --> 12:00.609
Huh, well, so you're
relinquishing control
to your little sister.

12:00.709 --> 12:03.625
You must really be tired.

12:07.667 --> 12:12.042
Please help us
through this day, Mom.

12:25.499 --> 12:28.084
(<i>sighs</i>)

12:29.418 --> 12:33.234
(<i>rock music playing

12:33.334 --> 12:36.750
(<i>rock music playing</i>)

12:44.542 --> 12:45.525
Hey.

12:45.625 --> 12:46.359
Hey.

12:46.459 --> 12:47.483
You shouldn't
have come back.

12:47.583 --> 12:48.525
What are you talking about?

12:48.625 --> 12:49.692
I spent all morning
with the cops.

12:49.792 --> 12:52.026
They think you killed a guy
and took his money.

12:52.126 --> 12:55.026
No, I-I didn't kill anyone.

12:55.126 --> 12:58.499
Good.
'Cause that's what I told them.

12:58.792 --> 13:01.234
So then why are
you still here?

13:01.334 --> 13:02.567
Waiting for you.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.399
But I didn't have
your phone number.

13:04.499 --> 13:07.959
You never even
gave me your name.

13:08.499 --> 13:10.026
That is the sexiest thing

13:10.126 --> 13:12.376
a man's ever done for me.

13:15.834 --> 13:20.483
Hey, you keep saying you want
to live a life with no rules,

13:20.583 --> 13:22.026
no responsibility?

13:22.126 --> 13:25.151
This is it. Your chance.

13:25.251 --> 13:26.499
Come on.

13:35.042 --> 13:37.109
Whoa!

13:37.209 --> 13:38.499
Take it easy.

13:44.292 --> 13:46.792
Don't do it for me, TJ.

13:48.042 --> 13:50.667
You don't want to be an
accessory to murder.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.399
The name's Prue.

13:56.499 --> 13:59.292
Prue Halliwell.

13:59.583 --> 14:01.567
OFFICER:
Put up your hands.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.151
Come on.

14:03.251 --> 14:06.817
TJ:
Look, I already
told you guys
everything I know...

14:06.917 --> 14:08.026
Yeah.

14:08.126 --> 14:10.292
Let's go.

14:11.126 --> 14:12.109
Prue?

14:12.209 --> 14:14.750
Prue, wake up.

14:18.792 --> 14:19.650
Prue!

14:19.750 --> 14:21.750
Oh... oh, no!

14:31.583 --> 14:34.542
(<i>gasps</i>)

14:37.750 --> 14:39.418
Oh, no.

14:43.084 --> 14:45.609
PRUE:
I was wanted for murder,
 but this...

14:45.709 --> 14:48.318
this guy in my dream,

14:48.418 --> 14:52.400
he... risked
himself to save me.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.399
This sexy guy.

14:53.499 --> 14:56.276
Prue, forget the guy.
What about the arrest?

14:56.376 --> 14:58.399
Right, uh, okay,
a cop handcuffed me

14:58.499 --> 14:59.817
and that's all
that I remember,

14:59.917 --> 15:02.400
except that I didn't
really want to wake up.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.692
It's like my dream was
overpowering me.

15:04.792 --> 15:07.483
Hmm, that's what
my premonitions feel like.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.067
They pull me against my will.

15:09.167 --> 15:11.692
You know, maybe somebody's
trying to pull me

15:11.792 --> 15:14.692
into a parallel world
or a dream dimension.

15:14.792 --> 15:15.734
Well, hopefully that someone

15:15.834 --> 15:18.234
will be in <i>The Book
of Shadows,</i> okay?

15:18.334 --> 15:19.399
Come on.

15:19.499 --> 15:20.650
Wait, should we tell Piper?

15:20.750 --> 15:21.942
No, I won't
let this be

15:22.042 --> 15:23.318
the one thing that
goes wrong today.

15:23.418 --> 15:26.775
I'll be okay as long
as I stay awake,
right? For Piper.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.525
For Piper.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.609
PIPER:
Hold it right there!

15:30.709 --> 15:31.692
What's wrong?

15:31.792 --> 15:33.483
Boy bands.

15:33.583 --> 15:34.942
There's just
far too many

15:35.042 --> 15:36.399
of them,
don't you think?

15:36.499 --> 15:39.359
No. What's wrong with you two?

15:39.459 --> 15:40.151
Uh, nothing's wrong.

15:40.251 --> 15:40.912
I can see it in your faces.

15:40.922 --> 15:42.483
We've been demon-hunting for
three years now.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.609
You're going to the attic,
aren't you?

15:44.709 --> 15:46.276
Yes.

15:46.376 --> 15:47.276
Phoebe!

15:47.376 --> 15:47.901
I knew it.

15:48.001 --> 15:49.692
PHOEBE:
What, Prue? She's
on to us, she knows.

15:49.792 --> 15:54.109
Yes, Piper, we were
heading to the attic...

15:54.209 --> 15:56.399
to find something old,
something new...

15:56.499 --> 15:59.984
Uh... something... something
borrowed and something...
(<i>stammering</i>)

16:00.084 --> 16:01.109
...blue.
...blue. Yes.

16:01.209 --> 16:01.859
PRUE:
Right.

16:01.959 --> 16:05.067
We were going to surprise you,
but now you caught us.

16:05.167 --> 16:05.859
Oh.

16:05.959 --> 16:06.650
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

16:06.750 --> 16:07.364
I mean, look, I told you,

16:07.464 --> 16:09.650
you have nothing to worry
about today, all right.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.483
It's going to be
a demon-free day.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.026
(<i>gasps</i>)

16:13.126 --> 16:13.775
Hey!

16:13.875 --> 16:16.859
Sorry I'm late.

16:16.959 --> 16:18.399
You were saying?

16:18.499 --> 16:21.026
Had a near-miss with Zoltar.

16:21.126 --> 16:23.167
Almost spotted me.

16:23.459 --> 16:26.942
Oh, don't worry,
I lost him... I think.

16:27.042 --> 16:29.525
See? No matter what, a demon
will attack today.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.192
It's just the natural
order of our universe.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.109
Piper, you have
to stay positive.

16:34.209 --> 16:34.901
You know what, I have

16:35.001 --> 16:37.442
<i>Celine Dion:
 Behind The Music
</i> on video cassette.

16:37.542 --> 16:38.567
Would you like
to watch that?

16:38.667 --> 16:39.494
Would you like
to get slapped?

16:39.504 --> 16:41.859
Hey, she's just trying
to relax you.
(<i>growls</i>)

16:41.959 --> 16:42.692
Don't worry.

16:42.792 --> 16:43.494
Leave the demons to me.

16:43.504 --> 16:45.734
I can handle anything
that comes through...

16:45.834 --> 16:46.399
Oh, no, you don't.

16:46.499 --> 16:48.734
You promised you were not
going to use

16:48.834 --> 16:50.734
your demonic powers anymore.

16:50.834 --> 16:51.984
Oh, sorry.

16:52.084 --> 16:53.026
Old habits.

16:53.126 --> 16:54.442
PHOEBE:
Yeah. Think good.

16:54.542 --> 16:55.942
Oh, I am, I am.

16:56.042 --> 16:58.400
Um, I brought a gift.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.042
Hmm.

17:02.084 --> 17:04.398
So you and Piper going
to move out,

17:04.499 --> 17:05.817
get your own place?

17:05.916 --> 17:08.499
Not right away.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.318
Well, just between
you and me,

17:10.417 --> 17:12.608
isn't that a little tough
on the old pride?

17:12.709 --> 17:14.026
Living off the girls
like that?

17:14.126 --> 17:16.983
Look, Victor, I know
you don't like the idea

17:17.084 --> 17:20.192
of your daughter marrying
a whitelighter.

17:20.291 --> 17:21.483
Oh, I never said that.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.692
But now that you mention it,

17:22.791 --> 17:24.608
yeah, I'd prefer Piper
marry a mortal.

17:24.709 --> 17:26.817
Well, Piper's not mortal,
she's a witch.

17:26.916 --> 17:29.775
She was given her gifts
to serve a higher calling.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.399
A calling only people like you
can understand, right?

17:32.499 --> 17:35.192
That's the same crap
my ex-wife's whitelighter

17:35.292 --> 17:37.609
used to steal
her away from me.

17:37.709 --> 17:41.442
You know, I'm sorry that
happened to you.

17:41.542 --> 17:42.399
I really am.

17:42.499 --> 17:44.399
But with all due respect,

17:44.499 --> 17:47.067
this isn't about you and Patty,

17:47.167 --> 17:49.359
this is about me and Piper.

17:49.459 --> 17:50.525
Now, I love her
with all my heart,

17:50.625 --> 17:52.109
and I promise
to keep loving her,

17:52.209 --> 17:54.650
and taking care of her
for the rest of this life,

17:54.750 --> 17:56.817
the afterlife and whatever
comes after that.

17:56.917 --> 17:59.817
Now, you may not support it,
and you may not agree with it,

17:59.917 --> 18:01.399
but it is not going to stop me

18:01.499 --> 18:03.442
from marrying
your daughter today.

18:03.542 --> 18:04.567
Nothing will.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.399
(<i>sighs</i>)

18:06.499 --> 18:09.001
You know...

18:09.667 --> 18:11.399
I could probably get used

18:11.499 --> 18:13.151
to having a whitelighter

18:13.251 --> 18:15.525
for a son-in-law.

18:15.625 --> 18:18.042
(<i>footsteps</i>)

18:19.499 --> 18:21.775
Everybody having fun down here?

18:21.875 --> 18:24.625
Where do you stand on demons?

18:26.126 --> 18:29.234
Hey, did you find anything in
the <i>Book</i> about your dreams?

18:29.334 --> 18:29.901
Nothing.

18:30.001 --> 18:30.775
What are we going to do?

18:30.875 --> 18:31.734
The wedding's
in a half an hour.

18:31.834 --> 18:34.399
Get ready, get set,
get through it, for Piper.

18:34.499 --> 18:36.709
For Piper.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.734
Oh, you're so beautiful.

18:52.834 --> 18:53.859
Mom?

18:53.959 --> 18:56.625
Don't be afraid.

19:00.499 --> 19:01.859
Oh, my God!

19:01.959 --> 19:03.318
But no way.

19:03.418 --> 19:06.650
It can't
because ghosts...

19:06.750 --> 19:08.026
ghosts glow.

19:08.126 --> 19:09.525
And you're not glowing.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.667
Well, I'm not a ghost.

19:12.709 --> 19:13.942
Well, not today.

19:14.042 --> 19:18.399
Today I am...
I am simply your mother.

19:18.499 --> 19:19.567
But, uh...

19:19.667 --> 19:20.400
how?

19:20.500 --> 19:23.399
After all the Elders put
you and Leo through,

19:23.499 --> 19:24.494
they wanted to give you
something back

19:24.504 --> 19:29.251
so... so they sent me down,
just for your wedding day.

19:29.667 --> 19:33.692
You know, I think I wore my hair
like this for my wedding day.

19:33.792 --> 19:34.318
You did.

19:34.418 --> 19:39.376
Uh... I kept your wedding album
after you died and...

19:39.499 --> 19:41.609
And I looked at the pictures

19:41.709 --> 19:44.399
every night
like a bedtime story.

19:44.499 --> 19:47.567
I always thought you'd be
the first to get married.

19:47.667 --> 19:50.792
You're the heart
of this family, Piper.

19:56.209 --> 19:57.775
I'm not dreaming, am I?

19:57.875 --> 20:00.609
No, sweetie, you're not.

20:00.709 --> 20:03.499
Oh, Mom!

20:11.792 --> 20:13.583
Mom.

20:15.376 --> 20:16.359
Oh...!

20:16.459 --> 20:17.859
PIPER:
It's true.

20:17.959 --> 20:18.692
She's real.

20:18.792 --> 20:21.750
They sent her to us for today.

20:23.499 --> 20:24.318
Oh, Prue.

20:24.418 --> 20:28.583
It's been so hard on you.

20:29.499 --> 20:31.334
Unfair.

20:33.542 --> 20:37.775
Yeah... no.

20:37.875 --> 20:38.525
It doesn't matter.

20:38.625 --> 20:40.109
I just wanted to make you proud.

20:40.209 --> 20:43.151
You protected this family
better than I could.

20:43.251 --> 20:45.276
I'm so proud of you.

20:45.376 --> 20:47.499
Thank you.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.026
And you... my baby.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.399
You feel it all, don't you?

20:54.499 --> 20:57.901
I was never there
to comfort you.

20:58.001 --> 20:59.109
I died before

20:59.209 --> 21:00.276
you even knew me.

21:00.376 --> 21:04.499
Some nights, I just
wanted you to hold me.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.817
Your road's been
the longest, Phoebe.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.318
But I was never
worried about you.

21:11.418 --> 21:11.859
You know why?

21:11.959 --> 21:16.067
Because I had a premonition
the day you were born.

21:16.167 --> 21:17.109
You did?

21:17.209 --> 21:18.442
What did you see?

21:18.542 --> 21:20.483
Oh, I saw this.

21:20.583 --> 21:21.399
I saw this moment

21:21.499 --> 21:25.399
right now, my three daughters
standing before me

21:25.499 --> 21:27.234
as beautiful

21:27.334 --> 21:27.775
young women

21:27.875 --> 21:31.318
and I knew that
everything
would be okay.

21:31.418 --> 21:33.151
What did you see next?

21:33.251 --> 21:35.834
I held you.

21:39.542 --> 21:41.209
(<i>sighs</i>)

21:48.167 --> 21:52.042
Places, places everyone.

21:55.459 --> 21:57.276
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

21:57.376 --> 21:58.692
Don't answer that.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.942
PIPER:
Can somebody
answer that?

22:01.042 --> 22:02.901
Ooh! I'll get it.

22:03.001 --> 22:04.542
(<i>stammers</i>)

22:07.167 --> 22:08.734
Hey, you're late.
Where were you?

22:08.834 --> 22:10.276
Trying to save
your ass.

22:10.376 --> 22:10.745
Huh?

22:10.755 --> 22:11.942
The police have
your picture.

22:12.042 --> 22:13.026
You're wanted
for murder.

22:13.126 --> 22:15.399
They said you fled
custody this morning.

22:15.499 --> 22:16.525
Oh, my God, that was your dream.

22:16.625 --> 22:18.026
They don't have
your name yet,

22:18.126 --> 22:19.442
but it's only a matter of time.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.499
GRAMS:
Girls?

22:21.750 --> 22:25.400
All right, let's just stay cool
and, uh, we'll go downtown

22:25.500 --> 22:26.413
and straighten this out later.

22:26.423 --> 22:29.359
But we have to get through the
wedding first, okay, for Piper?

22:29.459 --> 22:30.959
For Piper.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.318
You're supposed
to say "for Piper."

22:33.418 --> 22:36.292
Yeah, I... It better be
a quick wedding.

22:38.959 --> 22:42.026
Everything looks perfect
except Victor.

22:42.126 --> 22:44.901
Could you move
a little to your left?

22:45.001 --> 22:46.359
Sure. Why?

22:46.459 --> 22:49.499
Well, to make room for...

22:51.875 --> 22:52.400
Patty!

22:52.500 --> 22:54.234
Hello, Victor.
How are you?

22:54.334 --> 22:54.984
Good.

22:55.084 --> 22:56.399
I mean, it was good.

22:56.499 --> 22:57.942
All right,
who brought

22:58.042 --> 23:00.399
my ex-wife back
from the dead?

23:00.499 --> 23:02.234
GRAMS:
Not now, Victor.

23:02.334 --> 23:03.775
I know you two have issues,

23:03.875 --> 23:07.251
but that's what
the reception is for.

23:08.292 --> 23:11.499
(<i>Pachelbel's Canon

23:29.834 --> 23:30.984
We did it.

23:31.084 --> 23:32.750
It's really happening.

23:36.001 --> 23:36.959

23:48.750 --> 23:49.609
Prue!

23:49.709 --> 23:51.499
Who in the hell
is that?

23:52.499 --> 23:53.399
Oh-oh-oh, no!

23:53.499 --> 23:55.251
(<i>gasps</i>)

24:02.167 --> 24:02.567
You came.

24:02.667 --> 24:03.483
Had to beat the cops.

24:03.583 --> 24:04.942
I won't let them
take you.

24:05.042 --> 24:05.442
PIPER:
Prue!

24:05.542 --> 24:06.984
What the hell is going on?

24:07.084 --> 24:10.292
Prue, get your astral ass
back here!

24:13.500 --> 24:14.709
(<i>gasps</i>)

24:24.542 --> 24:26.192

(<i>gasps</i>)

24:35.499 --> 24:38.192
All right, that's it.

24:38.292 --> 24:42.459
The wedding is off!

24:43.167 --> 24:45.026
(<i>fabric rips</i>)
Ooh, Phoebe!

24:45.126 --> 24:45.537
Sorry. Sorry.

24:45.547 --> 24:49.875
Piper. Piper, wait!
Think about this.

24:53.209 --> 24:54.984
Piper? Piper?!

24:55.084 --> 24:56.734
You cannot just leave.

24:56.834 --> 24:57.399
Yes, I can.

24:57.499 --> 24:58.859
A demon I could
have handled,

24:58.959 --> 25:01.234
but my big sister
ruining my wedding?

25:01.334 --> 25:02.151
I cannot handle that!

25:02.251 --> 25:04.399
Okay, just listen to me
for one second.

25:04.499 --> 25:05.817
All we have to do
is find a way...

25:05.917 --> 25:08.399
No. No. I don't want
to find a way to get married

25:08.499 --> 25:09.399
on my wedding day.

25:09.499 --> 25:11.399
It's just... it's too hard.

25:11.499 --> 25:13.442
There must be a reason.

25:13.542 --> 25:14.525
Piper...

25:14.625 --> 25:14.942
Leo,

25:15.042 --> 25:19.192
I'm sorry, but this is just
the final straw.

25:19.292 --> 25:21.499
It's just not meant to be.

25:34.042 --> 25:38.126
I've never seen Piper
so defeated.

25:40.376 --> 25:43.399
Prue, come on, wake up!

25:43.499 --> 25:44.609
Prue, come on!

25:44.709 --> 25:46.692
Honey, you won't
get her back that way.

25:46.792 --> 25:48.442
A part of Prue wanted
to escape,

25:48.542 --> 25:51.151
and it used her
astral self to do it.

25:51.251 --> 25:52.400
If the wedding's off,

25:52.500 --> 25:53.692
I have to go.

25:53.792 --> 25:56.399
I'm only here
to conduct the ceremony.

25:56.499 --> 25:58.500
I'm sorry.

26:01.376 --> 26:04.001
(<i>sighs</i>)

26:04.625 --> 26:06.318
Maybe Piper's right.

26:06.418 --> 26:08.692
Maybe the wedding
just wasn't meant to be.

26:08.792 --> 26:09.399
Victor!

26:09.499 --> 26:10.399
All I'm saying
is maybe

26:10.499 --> 26:11.494
the gods
are trying to spare them

26:11.504 --> 26:13.499
the pain that we went through.

26:14.499 --> 26:15.399
No.

26:15.499 --> 26:16.984
All I need

26:17.084 --> 26:17.537
is what's inside me

26:17.547 --> 26:20.542
to know that Piper
and I are meant to be together.

26:21.209 --> 26:23.942
What happened here today...

26:24.042 --> 26:29.084
Piper and Leo's love
has touched us all.

26:29.709 --> 26:31.399
We have to fix this.

26:31.499 --> 26:32.359
(<i>beeping</i>)

26:32.459 --> 26:35.109
I gotta go
fend off the posse.

26:35.209 --> 26:37.084
What posse?

26:38.251 --> 26:40.499
Prue's wanted for murder.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.318
I'll stay in touch
by cell phone.

26:43.418 --> 26:44.775
Murder?

26:44.875 --> 26:45.494
You knew about this?

26:45.504 --> 26:47.400
I just found out
when Morris told Prue.

26:47.500 --> 26:48.775
But it's obviously a mistake.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.109
I mean,
Prue wouldn't murder anybody.

26:51.209 --> 26:52.399
Are you sure?

26:52.499 --> 26:52.984
I mean,

26:53.084 --> 26:54.067
Prue's astral form seems

26:54.167 --> 26:56.109
to have taken on a life
of its own.

26:56.209 --> 26:58.234
How do you know
she didn't do it?

26:58.334 --> 26:59.234
Because I know her.

26:59.334 --> 26:59.984
Oh, yeah.

27:00.084 --> 27:02.499
At least I think I do.

27:03.209 --> 27:04.109
LEO:
All right.

27:04.209 --> 27:06.399
All right, you guys find Piper,

27:06.499 --> 27:07.442
bring her back here somehow.

27:07.542 --> 27:08.442
Phoebe,<i>Book of Shadows.</i>

27:08.542 --> 27:09.525
See if there's a spell

27:09.625 --> 27:10.399
to bring astral Prue back.

27:10.499 --> 27:15.499
Cole, you and me are gonna do a
little investigating of our own.

27:15.875 --> 27:16.817
All right, come on you guys.

27:16.917 --> 27:18.500
We've got a wedding to save.

27:28.209 --> 27:29.151
Hmm.

27:29.251 --> 27:32.026
Interesting place
to dream about.

27:32.126 --> 27:34.292
Especially for Prue.

27:39.042 --> 27:40.567
Based on what
Morris said,

27:40.667 --> 27:43.942
someone must have knifed the
victim after astral Prue left.

27:44.042 --> 27:47.234
And by the looks of this crowd,
it could be anybody.

27:47.334 --> 27:47.704
No, not anybody.

27:47.714 --> 27:50.042
Very few humans have
the heart of a true killer...

27:51.499 --> 27:54.234
...one who kills
without prejudice.

27:54.334 --> 27:55.399
How do you know?

27:55.499 --> 27:56.359
I can always sense it.

27:56.459 --> 27:58.650
Before I suppressed
my demonic side for Phoebe,

27:58.750 --> 28:03.583
I could sense how human
killers felt inside.

28:08.499 --> 28:09.859
He's here.

28:09.959 --> 28:11.399
The murderer?

28:11.499 --> 28:13.192
Are you sure?

28:13.292 --> 28:14.399
That he's our murderer? No.

28:14.499 --> 28:18.399
But he's got fresh blood
on his hands.

28:18.499 --> 28:20.500
Go get Morris.

28:24.042 --> 28:26.400
<i>Just let me do the talking.</i>

28:26.500 --> 28:28.942
You always had a way
of saying the wrong thing

28:29.042 --> 28:29.775
when they were young.

28:29.875 --> 28:30.650
Wrong according
to you.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.399
You were never open
to what I had to say

28:32.499 --> 28:36.542
because you wanted
to raise them as witches.

28:37.625 --> 28:41.459
Instead of
little girls.

28:48.499 --> 28:49.901
We were worried.

28:50.001 --> 28:53.251
I'm sorry.
I let everyone down.

28:53.499 --> 28:56.026
Honey, you have nothing
to apologize for.

28:56.126 --> 28:58.483
It is a tribute
to you and Leo

28:58.583 --> 29:00.942
that you made it
as far as you did, I think.

29:01.042 --> 29:03.234
Yeah, but we didn't make it
all the way.

29:03.334 --> 29:05.234
Not yet maybe, but...

29:05.334 --> 29:06.318
Not ever.

29:06.418 --> 29:08.567
I mean, I think it's
obvious, don't you?

29:08.667 --> 29:11.525
Leo and I are just
clearly not...

29:11.625 --> 29:12.399
...destined to be?

29:12.499 --> 29:13.192
Oh, I don't believe that.

29:13.292 --> 29:16.859
And I don't think that you
really believe that either.

29:16.959 --> 29:17.399
Don't I?

29:17.499 --> 29:21.192
All I have to do
is look at you and Dad

29:21.292 --> 29:25.318
to see where I might end up
if I marry Leo.

29:25.418 --> 29:26.192
I mean,

29:26.292 --> 29:27.400
look at the track record.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.026
As Halliwells,
we are blessed as witches

29:30.126 --> 29:32.318
and we are cursed as women.

29:32.418 --> 29:33.276
Sometimes I think

29:33.376 --> 29:36.942
we're all just destined
to end up alone.

29:37.042 --> 29:39.418
Well, you don't really...

29:39.750 --> 29:43.084
I mean, just because...

29:45.499 --> 29:45.942
Victor...

29:46.042 --> 29:49.192
You think your mother
and I were cursed?

29:49.292 --> 29:50.942
Don't you?

29:51.042 --> 29:56.151
Honestly, I look back on those
days as the best of my life.

29:56.251 --> 29:57.318
I loved your mother.

29:57.418 --> 29:58.400
She was the best thing

29:58.500 --> 29:59.525
that ever happened to me

29:59.625 --> 30:02.399
until the three of you
came along.

30:02.499 --> 30:05.318
But your marriage
still didn't last.

30:05.418 --> 30:08.483
Yeah, and that hurt...
a lot.

30:08.583 --> 30:11.276
But it was our love
that gave

30:11.376 --> 30:13.917
birth to you and your sisters.

30:14.875 --> 30:18.292
Maybe that was my destiny.

30:22.459 --> 30:26.001
I'm sorry.
I just need to be alone.

30:34.292 --> 30:35.109
Not bad for a guy

30:35.209 --> 30:37.483
who always says the wrong thing.

30:37.583 --> 30:40.292
Thanks.

30:40.499 --> 30:43.667
I just wish I knew
that it helped.

30:57.126 --> 30:59.251
Gotcha.

31:01.001 --> 31:01.609
I just gotta know,

31:01.709 --> 31:03.442
how'd you get away
from the cops?

31:03.542 --> 31:06.276
You know, I don't really
want to talk about that.

31:06.376 --> 31:09.359
I mean, I'm here now, that's
all that really matters, right?

31:09.459 --> 31:13.234
Yeah, but for how long?

31:13.334 --> 31:14.109
Do you care?

31:14.209 --> 31:18.901
Well, I did crash
your sister's wedding.

31:19.001 --> 31:21.399
Mm, yes, you did.

31:21.499 --> 31:22.067
And, um...

31:22.167 --> 31:25.734
hey, I'm harboring you
from the cops.

31:25.834 --> 31:27.942
And I appreciate that.

31:28.042 --> 31:28.609
I mean,

31:28.709 --> 31:29.859
we're definitely past

31:29.959 --> 31:31.400
first-date behavior here.

31:31.500 --> 31:34.234
So then why are you
still talking?

31:34.334 --> 31:38.026
Prue, I don't need much.

31:38.126 --> 31:40.959
But I need to know one thing.

31:41.499 --> 31:43.318
Are you gonna take off on me
again tonight?

31:43.418 --> 31:47.525
You know, I hadn't really
thought about it.

31:47.625 --> 31:49.650
I mean, for the first time
in my life I'm free,

31:49.750 --> 31:53.399
so I'm sort of just living
moment to moment.

31:53.499 --> 31:54.399
Is that okay?

31:54.499 --> 31:56.276
I'm cool with that.

31:56.376 --> 31:58.499
Cool with that?

32:04.499 --> 32:05.399
(<i>whoosh</i>)

32:05.499 --> 32:07.026
Mmm... Oh, not now!

32:07.126 --> 32:09.400
What's wrong? Prue!

32:09.500 --> 32:11.525
Prue!
Where are you going?

32:11.625 --> 32:12.901
No.

32:13.001 --> 32:13.734
I am free.

32:13.834 --> 32:16.500
I am not going back,
I won't let...!

32:19.126 --> 32:20.817
No, I will not let you

32:20.917 --> 32:22.499
take me!

32:25.251 --> 32:26.942
Nice spell, huh?

32:27.042 --> 32:28.567
How dare you?

32:28.667 --> 32:29.192
How dare <i>you.</i>

32:29.292 --> 32:32.399
You destroyed Piper's wedding
along with Piper.

32:32.499 --> 32:33.984
Now, Prue,
I don't know what's

32:34.084 --> 32:34.537
going on with you,

32:34.547 --> 32:37.001
but you have got to pull
yourself together.

32:39.042 --> 32:41.292
I am outta here.

32:42.001 --> 32:43.859
(<i>screams</i>)
You know what?

32:43.959 --> 32:45.817
You cannot stop me,
all right?

32:45.917 --> 32:47.318
I am never going back.

32:47.418 --> 32:48.399
I'm not going...

32:48.499 --> 32:49.151
Whoo!

32:49.251 --> 32:50.542
(<i>squeals</i>)

32:51.126 --> 32:53.399
All right, you know what?
I am sick of this.

32:53.499 --> 32:56.734
She is all about duty
and obligation.

32:56.834 --> 32:57.609
Well, not me.

32:57.709 --> 32:58.859
All right, I want to be free.

32:58.959 --> 33:01.359
I want to find love.
I want to have a life.

33:01.459 --> 33:03.067
Well, Prue,
you have responsibilities,

33:03.167 --> 33:03.984
whether you like it or not.

33:04.084 --> 33:07.067
Don't talk to me about being
responsible, Phoebe, all right?

33:07.167 --> 33:08.399
You were not very responsible

33:08.499 --> 33:10.442
when you went and fell in love
with a demon.

33:10.542 --> 33:11.234
Oh, please.

33:11.334 --> 33:14.234
You have got to let this
whole Cole thing go, okay.

33:14.334 --> 33:15.734
You can't stay mad at me
forever.

33:15.834 --> 33:17.817
I'm not mad at you, Phoebe.

33:17.917 --> 33:18.817
I never was.

33:18.917 --> 33:20.359
All right, she was.

33:20.459 --> 33:22.499
I was rooting for you.

33:23.834 --> 33:25.399
Okay, now you're scaring me.

33:25.499 --> 33:29.399
You risked everything for love,
just like Piper and Leo.

33:29.499 --> 33:32.067
I dream of having
that kind of freedom,

33:32.167 --> 33:35.525
but instead I get stuck watching
my sisters live my dream.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.376
Wait a minute.

33:37.834 --> 33:41.400
You astraled out
in a dream

33:41.500 --> 33:44.400
when your subconscious
takes over.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.318
So what?

33:45.418 --> 33:46.400
So I just studied this.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.901
It's Psych 101. Freud.

33:49.001 --> 33:52.399
You are the id,
Prue's inner desires.

33:52.499 --> 33:54.026
Which means that she

33:54.126 --> 33:55.859
is the ego,

33:55.959 --> 33:57.151
the control factor.

33:57.251 --> 33:59.399
Yeah, well, she is
one big remote control,

33:59.499 --> 34:01.359
and she's always got me
on pause.

34:01.459 --> 34:02.399
I think
I understand.

34:02.499 --> 34:06.151
The sacrifices that you've
made for us over the years,

34:06.251 --> 34:10.167
they made you suppress
your inner desires.

34:12.208 --> 34:15.025
Yeah, well,
don't tell me, tell her.

34:15.126 --> 34:16.984
No, I'm telling you

34:17.083 --> 34:18.067
because you are Prue.

34:18.167 --> 34:20.900
I mean, and you are both
two sides of my sister.

34:21.001 --> 34:25.318
Prue, you have to stop
devoting your entire self

34:25.418 --> 34:26.399
to the Charmed Ones.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.542
It'll tear you apart, literally.

34:30.917 --> 34:32.650
Is Piper very mad at me?

34:32.750 --> 34:34.067
(<i>sighs</i>)

34:34.167 --> 34:36.525
She'll get over it.

34:36.625 --> 34:38.150
And you know why?

34:38.251 --> 34:40.318
Because we're okay now.

34:40.418 --> 34:40.745
Piper and me.

34:40.755 --> 34:44.442
We've both got passion
and purpose in our lives.

34:44.542 --> 34:47.109
And you gave us that.

34:47.208 --> 34:48.025
I did?

34:48.126 --> 34:50.001
You took care of us.

34:50.958 --> 34:53.917
And now it's time
to take care of you.

35:05.499 --> 35:07.775
Welcome back.

35:07.875 --> 35:10.399
Thanks.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.292
For everything.

35:13.376 --> 35:17.709
Oh, no.

35:20.499 --> 35:22.209
Oh...!

35:22.792 --> 35:27.067
I cannot believe
I wrecked Piper's wedding.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.609
Only part of you did.

35:28.709 --> 35:31.234
Is it too late
to fix it?

35:31.334 --> 35:33.483
Oh... now what?

35:33.583 --> 35:34.709
Freeze!

35:35.251 --> 35:36.399
Stay where you are,

35:36.499 --> 35:37.499
don't move!

35:39.334 --> 35:40.875
Prue Halliwell...

35:42.001 --> 35:44.625
...you're under arrest
for murder.

35:53.334 --> 35:54.318
All right, sit down.

35:54.418 --> 35:57.084
The inspector will be
with you shortly.

36:00.084 --> 36:01.792
(<i>door closes</i>)

36:07.459 --> 36:09.442
This is all our fault.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.192
(<i>loud rock music playing</i>)

36:11.292 --> 36:13.583
(<i>pool balls clacking</i>)

36:15.042 --> 36:16.734
Prue's been booked
for murder.

36:16.834 --> 36:18.192
We're running out of time.

36:18.292 --> 36:20.542
Leo says you
found the killer.

36:22.209 --> 36:23.525
Found <i>a</i> killer.

36:23.625 --> 36:25.859
Oh, great, you mean
you don't know?

36:25.959 --> 36:28.167
What are you
gonna do, ask him?

36:35.667 --> 36:37.067
That's a good idea.

36:37.167 --> 36:40.167
Why don't you meet me
out front in five?

36:56.126 --> 36:59.984
Is that the spot
where they found the body?

37:00.084 --> 37:01.318
Who are you?

37:01.418 --> 37:03.026
I'm here to find out
what you know about

37:03.126 --> 37:06.483
the murder that took
place here last night.

37:06.583 --> 37:08.734
Why don't you
show me your badge?

37:08.834 --> 37:11.318
Oh, no, I'm not a cop.

37:11.418 --> 37:12.942
I'm a... fortune teller.

37:13.042 --> 37:16.499
And I predict you're gonna
give me a confession.

37:17.875 --> 37:19.276
You're a funny man, huh?

37:19.376 --> 37:22.376
Why don't you
excuse me, huh?

37:32.376 --> 37:34.399
I'll guess that's the knife
you used on the victim

37:34.499 --> 37:35.984
when you found him
unconscious, right?

37:36.084 --> 37:39.625
Yeah, you want a little
closer look at it, huh?

37:45.126 --> 37:46.734
One more chance--

37:46.834 --> 37:49.692
confess to the murder
and talk to the police.

37:49.792 --> 37:51.499
Or what, huh?

37:55.084 --> 37:57.209
(<i>deep voice</i>):
Or deal with me.

38:05.499 --> 38:08.042
I think he's ready
to talk.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.483
I don't get it,
Prue should be back by now.

38:17.583 --> 38:18.525
The police
have the killer.

38:18.625 --> 38:19.399
COLE:
They might have

38:19.499 --> 38:20.650
held her over
for escaping custody.

38:20.750 --> 38:22.859
Can we get some light
while we're waiting?
Yeah.

38:22.959 --> 38:26.500
No, Dad, the police
cut the power line.

38:27.418 --> 38:28.399
I'm sorry, Patty

38:28.499 --> 38:30.399
They sent me to take you back.

38:30.499 --> 38:32.942
PHOEBE:
No, it's... it's
not midnight yet.

38:33.042 --> 38:34.399
We still have
five more minutes.

38:34.499 --> 38:35.318
VICTOR:
I should have said

38:35.418 --> 38:36.567
something more
to convince Piper.

38:36.667 --> 38:38.942
Oh, you said everything,
you were wonderful.

38:39.042 --> 38:41.959
(<i>footsteps</i>)

38:43.084 --> 38:43.734
Sorry we're late.

38:43.834 --> 38:46.917
What, not who you
were expecting?

38:47.500 --> 38:48.399
PIPER:
So...

38:48.499 --> 38:51.292
okay, what are
we waiting for?

38:51.917 --> 38:54.542
Don't look so shocked.

38:55.750 --> 38:59.750
Girls, it's show time.

39:06.126 --> 39:07.399
A little help here.

39:07.499 --> 39:08.192
Shh!
Shh.

39:08.292 --> 39:10.567
I, uh, noticed you
don't have a best man.

39:10.667 --> 39:13.318
If you like, I could...

39:13.418 --> 39:15.499
I'd be honored.

39:16.499 --> 39:18.709
Oh, no, there's
no power for music.

39:20.084 --> 39:20.859
(<i>chimes play</i>)

39:20.959 --> 39:25.499
All right, is that the best
that we can do on the lights?

39:35.499 --> 39:36.399
That's more like it.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.499
(<i>Grams clears throat</i>)

39:38.875 --> 39:42.859
We are gathered here today
to unite two souls as one.

39:42.959 --> 39:46.399
Do you, Leo Wyatt
and Piper Halliwell,

39:46.499 --> 39:48.067
join us here
of your own free will

39:48.167 --> 39:52.067
to acknowledge the eternal bond
shared by both of you?

39:52.167 --> 39:53.483
I do.

39:53.583 --> 39:54.359
I do.

39:54.459 --> 39:58.276
You may face each other.
Join hands.

39:58.376 --> 40:00.609
Leo, you may recite your vows.

40:00.709 --> 40:03.525
Piper...

40:03.625 --> 40:04.859
through all the tears
and struggles,

40:04.959 --> 40:08.026
I always knew in my heart
that we would make it here.

40:08.126 --> 40:08.984
I promise

40:09.084 --> 40:12.984
to love and respect you
from this point forward

40:13.084 --> 40:14.525
as your husband,

40:14.625 --> 40:15.817
as my wife,

40:15.917 --> 40:20.399
my lover, my friend

40:20.499 --> 40:22.334
and my soul mate.

40:22.959 --> 40:25.399
All I am is yours.

40:25.499 --> 40:27.067
Piper.

40:27.167 --> 40:28.399
Leo...

40:28.499 --> 40:29.650
(<i>clears throat</i>)

40:29.750 --> 40:32.817
you are the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

40:32.917 --> 40:34.399
I was afraid that

40:34.499 --> 40:36.109
you were too good to be true--

40:36.209 --> 40:39.318
that maybe I didn't deserve
someone so pure

40:39.418 --> 40:42.442
and beautiful
and loving as you are.

40:42.542 --> 40:43.942
But here we are
surrounded

40:44.042 --> 40:46.399
by the people
that I love the most.

40:46.499 --> 40:49.026
And I feel so proud

40:49.126 --> 40:51.067
and so blessed to be your wife.

40:51.167 --> 40:52.399
Leo, I was born

40:52.499 --> 40:53.942
to love you.

40:54.042 --> 40:57.499
And I always will.

40:58.583 --> 41:00.400
(<i>sighs</i>)

41:00.500 --> 41:01.817
Here before witnesses,

41:01.917 --> 41:04.442
Leo and Piper have sworn
their vows to each other.

41:04.542 --> 41:10.126
With this cord,
I bind them to those vows.

41:11.334 --> 41:14.109
BOTH:
Heart to thee, body to thee,

41:14.209 --> 41:18.359
always and forever,
so mote it be.

41:18.459 --> 41:19.399
So mote it be.

41:19.499 --> 41:22.192
ALL:
Some mote it be.

41:22.292 --> 41:23.442
(<i>chimes</i>)

41:23.542 --> 41:24.859
Kiss her, fast.

41:24.959 --> 41:27.792
(<i>clock chiming</i>)

41:29.499 --> 41:31.459
(<i>cheers, applause</i>)
