01:56.283 --> 01:57.783
You do windows now?

01:57.785 --> 02:01.186
Side effect of the coma.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.422
Doctor didn't mention that
as a possibility.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.757
It's rare.

02:05.759 --> 02:10.362
Seriously, you're not pushing
it, are you, brother?

02:10.364 --> 02:13.198
I think I can manage
a few panes.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.837
Didn't you get an apartment?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.806
The amenities are nicer here.

02:23.776 --> 02:26.879
God, I can't believe
you're upright.

02:26.881 --> 02:30.782
Makes two of us.

02:30.784 --> 02:34.386
I thought
we were gonna lose you.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.522
No crying, sister.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.392
Sorry.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.494
Emotion is for losers.

02:46.766 --> 02:48.834
Will you at least
let me do the windows?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.235
It's driving me crazy.

02:50.237 --> 02:54.273
No, I want to...
do things, you know?

02:54.275 --> 02:58.577
Being up, and it helps...
moving.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.847
Can I at least give you a hug?

03:01.849 --> 03:04.383
Oh, definitely no hugs.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.553
My ribs are still pretty sore.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.354
That's 'cause four of them
were broken

03:09.356 --> 03:11.836
And not a damn thing's
been done about it.

03:15.295 --> 03:17.396
What?

03:17.398 --> 03:19.698
Fritters.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.233
Fritters?

03:21.235 --> 03:22.901
Apple fritters.

03:22.903 --> 03:26.338
Oh, god.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.273
You mean from swint's doughnuts?

03:28.275 --> 03:29.775
Please tell me
they haven't shut down.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.543
Are you kidding me?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.912
Obesity's the only thing
still selling in this economy.

03:33.914 --> 03:37.616
Oh, I dreamed about them.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.618
Well, I am gonna go
get us some, then.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.819
I wasn't fishing.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.487
Sure you weren't.

03:42.489 --> 03:43.622
You don't mind?

03:43.624 --> 03:45.424
Ugh, I so need purpose.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.359
Besides, a fritter a day...

03:48.795 --> 03:50.596
Something to look forward to?

03:50.598 --> 03:53.799
Everybody needs that.

04:14.887 --> 04:17.623
Think you slept good
through the night again,

04:17.625 --> 04:19.391
As far as I can tell.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.726
I'll take that as a positive.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.261
Absolutely.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.929
I couldn't help but peek
my head in his room

04:23.931 --> 04:25.764
A time or two, though.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.633
Part of me wanted to wake him up

04:27.635 --> 04:29.534
To make sure
I could wake him up.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.971
I hear you.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.941
<i>The vast majority of looms</i>
<i>are found in homes.</i>

04:38.445 --> 04:42.447
Ted, I think I finally
want to redo the kitchen.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.784
I think daniel wants
to do it, too.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.719
You know,
when he's feeling up to it.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.921
It'd be fun for us to have
a little project.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.624
Little?
Well, you know what I mean.

04:52.626 --> 04:57.629
I think it's finally just time,
if we hire the right people.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.532
I couldn't believe it was
one of the first things

05:00.534 --> 05:02.467
He mentioned when he woke up.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.705
Hard for me to wrap my head
right now

05:06.707 --> 05:09.007
Around a remodel, janet.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.709
You know the store's
been struggling.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.711
Well, I just thought,
maybe if we were smart...

05:12.713 --> 05:15.414
And it's just not a good time,
you know?

05:20.753 --> 05:24.323
I don't want you to be mad
about this.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.925
I'm just saying it's a bad time.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.660
That's all.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.996
Okay.

05:30.998 --> 05:34.666
Doesn't mean it can't happen
eventually.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.502
Just... Not now.

05:40.406 --> 05:42.407
I think those girls' rugs
are pretty.

05:42.409 --> 05:45.777
<i>...From afghanistan,</i>
<i>they bring to pakistan.</i>

05:45.779 --> 05:47.913
<i>Today,</i>
<i>around 80% of afghan carpets</i>

05:47.915 --> 05:50.849
<i>Are finished in pakistan,</i>
<i>then shipped abroad...</i>

05:50.851 --> 05:52.718
Thank you.
A dozen assorted?

05:52.720 --> 05:53.952
Yes, ma'am.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.987
That's $8.95, dear.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.992
Hi?

06:00.994 --> 06:03.895
I just thought the world
of your daddy.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.131
I remember him bringing you in

06:06.133 --> 06:08.734
When you were just
a little thing.

06:08.736 --> 06:12.371
You and... Your brother.

06:12.373 --> 06:15.006
Daddy was, uh...

06:15.008 --> 06:16.975
A lot of people liked him.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.677
And, dear...

06:18.679 --> 06:22.381
I'm glad they got bobby dean.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.782
What?

06:23.784 --> 06:25.617
They arrested him.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.552
They up and got him.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.788
I live right down the block
from judy and them.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.456
I saw them take him.

06:31.458 --> 06:35.694
And no matter what they say
about your brother,

06:35.696 --> 06:38.096
That shouldn't happen to him
like that.

06:50.878 --> 06:54.513
Did you ever get to sleep
last night?

06:54.515 --> 06:56.548
Little bit.

07:02.990 --> 07:06.024
I got a business
appointment, so...

07:07.994 --> 07:09.961
Teddy...
Yeah.

07:09.963 --> 07:14.633
I was thinking maybe we could do
something together tonight.

07:14.635 --> 07:18.036
Some sort of date-night thing
on purpose.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.738
What do you think?

07:19.740 --> 07:22.507
What specifics
did you have in mind?

07:24.811 --> 07:29.214
Maybe go to that new italian
place on mccauley street.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.616
They serve cheese as dessert.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.587
That's weird.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.490
Think it's european.

07:38.492 --> 07:42.594
I don't think I'm up
for a restaurant tonight.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.962
Well, I could...
I could make

07:43.964 --> 07:45.897
That fancy mac and cheese
you loved that time.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.647
Sure. Date night.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.016
Thank you.

08:05.018 --> 08:09.120
What are you thanking me for?

08:09.122 --> 08:11.923
Just because, I guess.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.203
Doughnuts?
Where's daniel?

08:25.205 --> 08:26.938
Upstairs, I think.
What's wrong?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.707
They arrested bobby dean.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.709
What?

08:29.710 --> 08:31.843
They friggin' arrested him!

08:31.845 --> 08:33.111
I don't even know how...

08:33.113 --> 08:35.981
Oh, my.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.015
It's hard to believe, right?

08:41.621 --> 08:42.988
Hello?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.589
Yes.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.591
It's the sheriff.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.194
Oh, I understand.

08:49.196 --> 08:53.999
Yes, uh,
I'd need to make sure, but...

08:54.001 --> 08:56.268
But, yes, uh...

08:56.270 --> 08:59.104
Thank you, sheriff.
Goodbye.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.173
He's coming by.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.575
He asked.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.176
He asked if he could,

09:05.178 --> 09:06.945
But... He's coming by.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.547
Here?

09:08.549 --> 09:10.815
This afternoon.
He wants to talk to daniel.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.118
What's he want to talk
with daniel about?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.954
Police work, I suppose.
I don't know.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.290
But he was asking, not telling.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.161
I'm getting a doughnut.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.006
We have to tell him.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.708
I know.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.743
We don't want daggett
coming by without...

09:38.745 --> 09:40.612
I know.

09:40.614 --> 09:43.648
But it's good news.

09:43.650 --> 09:46.585
Absolutely.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.965
I'll go.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.777
Hey, daniel.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.714
Here's your fritter.

10:15.716 --> 10:19.818
Something sweet in the morning.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.020
It's everything, isn't it?

10:22.022 --> 10:24.356
It's something.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.367
How you feeling?
You doing okay?

10:35.369 --> 10:38.737
I had a headache setting in,

10:38.739 --> 10:43.775
But I took one of the pain pills
the doctors gave me.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.243
That's good.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.878
Mother...

10:46.880 --> 10:48.413
Yes, daniel.

10:48.415 --> 10:52.384
I'd like to drive.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.953
Oh. Okay.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.788
Of course.
Why wouldn't you?

10:58.024 --> 11:00.225
You don't mean right now,
do you?

11:02.862 --> 11:04.362
Why... why not?

11:04.364 --> 11:06.097
Well...

11:06.099 --> 11:07.732
The thing is, honey,

11:07.734 --> 11:10.402
It might be best if we got you
your license first.

11:12.938 --> 11:17.842
Don't want to test the long arm
of the law now, do we?

11:19.413 --> 11:21.846
I don't think so.

11:23.115 --> 11:24.749
Daniel...

11:24.751 --> 11:28.753
It's mostly...
Buttons and... and knobs now.

11:28.755 --> 11:30.822
There's no...

11:30.824 --> 11:32.991
Everything's rounder.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.093
Hmm.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.128
I never really
thought about it before,

11:37.130 --> 11:38.329
But I think you're right.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.732
More... more curves,
less angles.

11:40.734 --> 11:41.933
Honey?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.802
Plastic, polymers...

11:43.804 --> 11:46.871
Sheriff daggett called
just a minute ago.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.741
He asked
if it might be all right

11:49.743 --> 11:52.744
If he stopped by
in a little while.

11:52.746 --> 11:56.214
Daniel?

11:58.150 --> 12:01.453
That's fine, mother.

12:01.455 --> 12:04.089
He can come whenever.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.431
I think I might...

12:13.433 --> 12:15.266
Play in the car a while longer.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.735
Great.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.503
Have fun.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.408
What?
You want to take these inside?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.977
No. Of course not.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.279
Don't be silly.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.415
Enjoy your fritter.

12:36.823 --> 12:39.124
Thanks, mama.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.101
Considering I have
the brick-and-mortar space

12:50.103 --> 12:51.970
Already available
in the tire store,

12:51.972 --> 12:54.405
I just need the capital
for the rim inventory itself.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.841
You don't have any ownership
stake in paulie tire yourself.

12:56.843 --> 12:58.042
Is that correct?

12:58.044 --> 12:59.477
Not officially, gretchen,

12:59.479 --> 13:02.480
But what I do have is knowledge
of the emerging trends

13:02.482 --> 13:04.382
In the tire and rim business,

13:04.384 --> 13:07.252
Both from my 10 years
on the ground, so to speak,

13:07.254 --> 13:09.287
And because it's right there

13:09.289 --> 13:12.957
In the t.I.A.'s annual figures
from '08 to 2012.

13:17.329 --> 13:19.430
After the economic crash in '08,

13:19.432 --> 13:21.499
You'll notice
a big-time uptick

13:21.501 --> 13:23.434
In customers choosing rental

13:23.436 --> 13:26.137
Or rent-to-own options
in rims...

13:26.139 --> 13:30.108
29% nationally and even more
than that in georgia.

13:30.110 --> 13:33.344
And... and it's not limited
to any, um...

13:33.346 --> 13:37.015
Specific demographic,
if you know what I'm saying.

13:37.017 --> 13:40.985
It's interesting.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.923
It <i> is</i> interesting...

13:44.925 --> 13:47.125
Gretchen.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.529
It's a sound plan, ted,

13:51.531 --> 13:53.431
But, unfortunately,

13:53.433 --> 13:55.834
There's not any business assets
listed here,

13:55.836 --> 13:58.002
Other than your truck,
to qualify as collateral.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.405
I understand,
and that's why what I...

14:00.407 --> 14:02.407
Well, what about your father?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.075
Could he co-sign with you?

14:04.077 --> 14:07.245
Unfortunately, the tire store's
not in his name.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.214
Oh.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.449
It's in my mom's.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.452
M-my stepmom's.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.221
Well, what about her?

14:16.223 --> 14:18.323
Could your dad talk to her?

14:18.325 --> 14:21.059
Oh, yeah.
Of course he could.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.393
Of course.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.597
Well, that sounds like
the best option.

14:25.599 --> 14:29.200
What about my house?

14:31.170 --> 14:32.904
With the equity
I already got in it,

14:32.906 --> 14:34.272
It should be more than enough.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.508
So, now you're saying

14:37.510 --> 14:40.411
That you want to put up
your house as collateral?

14:40.413 --> 14:44.048
I'm saying the business
is a slam dunk, gretchen.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.551
So, yes, my house.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.288
Okay.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.425
Let me take a look
at the numbers here.

14:54.427 --> 14:58.529
I kind of want to do this
on my own, you know?

14:58.531 --> 15:00.365
Mm-hmm.

15:00.367 --> 15:04.335
I see here that your wife
is on the deed, as well.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.104
That's right.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.672
And...

15:09.074 --> 15:12.610
Not a problem.
She's all behind it.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.240
Don't expect me to thank you
for doing your job.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.276
I don't.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.481
You were the victim of a crime,
mr. Holden.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.418
And that crime's
been investigated,

15:53.420 --> 15:56.587
And that investigation's led
to the arrest of a suspect.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.222
Now...

15:58.224 --> 15:59.691
Oh, sorry about the chair.
It's...

15:59.693 --> 16:01.392
Don't worry about the chair.

16:06.231 --> 16:08.466
That who you saw?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.668
May I hold it?

16:09.669 --> 16:10.669
Of course.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.240
Bobby dean.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.209
Yep.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.744
We know others were involved,

16:19.746 --> 16:22.413
But mr. Dean's the one
we identified for certain.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.453
I remember there being
a lot of boots.

16:28.455 --> 16:31.689
It's perfectly okay
if that's all you remember.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.659
I saw his face, though.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.695
Only for one
or two seconds, but...

16:47.272 --> 16:49.507
...It wasn't him.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.412
What's that now?

16:54.414 --> 16:56.547
It wasn't bobby dean.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.282
I saw his face.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.251
You already said that.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.653
It was a guy I'd...

17:02.655 --> 17:05.323
I'd never seen before.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.525
Or since.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.261
A guy I didn't know.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.700
So, what'd the fella
look like, then?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.803
Different.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.405
Different?

17:20.406 --> 17:22.106
Yes.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.041
Wasn't bobby dean?

17:24.044 --> 17:25.443
No.

17:27.445 --> 17:29.580
And if anybody needed me to,

17:29.582 --> 17:33.484
I would... Testify in court
to that fact.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.623
W-why would you need
to testify to that?

17:38.625 --> 17:40.591
It was just an offer.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.427
An offer to who?

17:42.429 --> 17:47.398
Bobby dean, I suppose.

18:04.316 --> 18:07.118
Daggett! Hey!

18:07.120 --> 18:08.586
Sheriff?

18:08.588 --> 18:11.289
That boy sees a pile of shit
on the ground,

18:11.291 --> 18:13.458
He's gonna make every damn
effort to step in it.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.792
If he gets his head
kicked in again...

18:14.794 --> 18:17.095
Excuse me?
What's going on?

18:17.097 --> 18:18.362
Just...
just tell me, please.

18:18.364 --> 18:22.333
He said it wasn't bobby dean.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.669
What?
Flat-out said it wasn't him.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.537
Of course it was bobby dean.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.606
You think I don't know that?

18:28.608 --> 18:31.209
It's always been a mystery to me
what you actually know.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.378
I did what I could.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.347
Daniel?

18:37.649 --> 18:40.118
Daniel?

18:45.290 --> 18:46.491
Not now.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.793
When?

18:48.795 --> 18:51.762
Later.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.532
It's always later.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.643
Looks like you're going
about this the hard way, my man.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.412
Just banging your head
against the wall.

19:08.414 --> 19:11.816
Not metaphorically, either.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.653
The metaphorical way can end up
hurting just as bad, though.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.722
But it would bleed less.

19:19.491 --> 19:23.361
I'm not authorized
to prescribe medication.

19:23.363 --> 19:27.598
Something that might make life
a little easier.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.868
At least easier than picking
fights with cert teams.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.738
But if an inmate makes
the request himself...

19:33.740 --> 19:38.342
Then I'm required to run
their request up the flagpole.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.647
Feel-good drugs?

19:44.550 --> 19:46.884
Feel-less-bad drugs,
maybe.

19:46.886 --> 19:50.955
You get what I'm saying?

19:50.957 --> 19:53.958
I do.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.828
And I will take it
under advisement.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.964
Thank you.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.799
You be easy now.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.768
Guard!

21:16.842 --> 21:19.477
Hash browns, three orders.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.046
Oh, hell, four.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.348
Five.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.550
Five hash browns.

21:26.552 --> 21:27.918
An order of steak and eggs.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.654
Comes with hash browns.

21:29.656 --> 21:30.888
Bonus.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.424
How you want your eggs?

21:33.426 --> 21:35.993
Doesn't say.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.796
Over easy?

21:38.798 --> 21:41.032
I don't think that would travel
too well.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.433
Where you headed?

21:42.435 --> 21:44.368
Death row.

21:45.604 --> 21:47.705
Kidding.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.676
Let's go with scrambled.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.645
Toast? Biscuit?

21:57.983 --> 22:00.618
People like biscuits.

22:00.620 --> 22:01.919
Perfect.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.788
Anything else?

22:03.790 --> 22:04.989
Two waffles.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.891
Want anything on it?

22:06.893 --> 22:08.559
What?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.795
Strawberries, blueberries,
chocolate chips?

22:10.797 --> 22:11.929
Chocolate chips?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.397
Okay.

22:13.399 --> 22:14.799
No, I mean,

22:14.801 --> 22:16.634
People put chocolate chips
on their waffles?

22:16.636 --> 22:18.402
Some people.

22:18.404 --> 22:21.339
Plain.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.374
Syrup.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.745
Thank you.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.920
I don't know, teddy.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.122
You don't know what?

22:38.124 --> 22:41.459
It just seems like we're rushing
into things, doesn't it?

22:41.461 --> 22:44.095
I've been working on this
for a long time, tawney.

22:44.097 --> 22:46.397
I-I know, honey, but...
but if your...

22:46.399 --> 22:48.099
Your daddy doesn't think
it's a good idea...

22:48.101 --> 22:51.869
Dad doesn't know good ideas.
He only knows old ones.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.472
Uh...
Are you siding
with him now?

22:54.474 --> 22:56.440
I'm not siding with anybody.

22:56.442 --> 22:59.510
I-I... it's just that this is
our house, honey.

22:59.512 --> 23:02.646
And that's why
we can leverage it.

23:02.648 --> 23:04.148
Or we could lose it.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.850
Yeah, we could.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.685
Especially if we don't
do something different

23:07.687 --> 23:10.020
Other than sell a few tires
every week to old white people.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.123
I-I-I'm not saying
that I'm not gonna sign it.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.525
I'm just saying that I...

23:14.527 --> 23:18.129
I think I need to know more
about the business plan and all.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.434
Well, I tell you what, tawney.

23:23.436 --> 23:25.136
Why don't you go work
in the tire business

23:25.138 --> 23:26.937
For a decade or so,

23:26.939 --> 23:30.441
Track all the significant
changes over that time period,

23:30.443 --> 23:33.878
And then you get back to me
with that business plan and all?

23:33.880 --> 23:36.680
Teddy, wait.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.940
I saw it fall this morning.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.610
You saw it fall?

25:12.612 --> 25:15.246
I heard it, too,
if you were curious.

25:19.150 --> 25:23.521
I think that the two of us
could drag it onto your grass.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.823
Oh, yeah?

25:25.825 --> 25:28.859
Sure.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.028
That'd be great.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.696
I guess.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.265
I'll get back here.

25:38.136 --> 25:40.905
1, 2, 3.

25:42.542 --> 25:43.941
Good grief!

25:43.943 --> 25:45.843
Thing's a bear.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.012
One more time.

25:49.814 --> 25:53.884
1, 2, 3.

26:02.295 --> 26:03.861
Are you okay?

26:07.300 --> 26:10.801
Should I go get your mother?

26:10.803 --> 26:14.238
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.

26:14.240 --> 26:19.343
To go beyond is as wrong
as falling short.

26:19.345 --> 26:22.079
How's that?

26:22.081 --> 26:26.083
I just need to sit for a while.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.786
Of course. Yeah.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.721
As long as you need.

26:38.863 --> 26:42.766
Why in god's name
would he do that?

26:42.768 --> 26:45.069
You got to be
wondering that, too.

26:45.071 --> 26:48.205
Please don't make me feel like
I'm the only one.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.342
He's got to move back to atlanta
with me, right?

26:51.344 --> 26:53.310
I mean, after he pulls
this stunt.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.079
- What stunt?
- There you are.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.780
Want a doughnut?

26:56.782 --> 26:58.916
What...
what was daniel's stunt?

26:58.918 --> 27:02.119
You don't want to know.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.188
I heard they arrested
bobby dean.

27:10.396 --> 27:13.063
How long have you lived here?

27:13.065 --> 27:16.266
Six years or so.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.836
This is a nice neighborhood.

27:18.838 --> 27:21.739
We got a good deal.

27:21.741 --> 27:24.174
Lots of squirrels.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.310
Eh, they're a nuisance.

27:42.694 --> 27:46.130
Ted.

27:46.132 --> 27:49.033
Teddy!

27:49.035 --> 27:52.136
Hey!

27:52.138 --> 27:54.038
Your, uh...

27:54.040 --> 27:55.773
He needs some assistance.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.308
No, I-I'm fine.
I'm fine!

27:58.310 --> 28:00.630
He got dizzy.
Do you mind?

28:02.047 --> 28:03.914
Sure!

28:03.916 --> 28:06.016
I'm good.
I-I'm good.

28:06.018 --> 28:09.353
He's not good.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.121
Why don't you let me give you
a hand there?

28:11.123 --> 28:14.958
No, I'm... I'm fine,
really.

28:14.960 --> 28:19.196
Come on. Just till we get
across the street.

28:19.198 --> 28:23.167
Sure, ted.
Very kind of you.

28:23.169 --> 28:25.135
No problema.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.404
Thanks for your help.

28:27.406 --> 28:30.307
Good intentions.

28:32.143 --> 28:34.712
I thought I could help.

28:34.714 --> 28:38.015
Sometimes we confuse feeling
better with being well.

28:38.017 --> 28:42.219
That's very observant, ted.

28:45.990 --> 28:50.360
Listen, ted, I don't exactly
know how to broach this.

28:50.362 --> 28:55.332
Yep, I think you just need to
get a little bit of rest, and...

28:55.334 --> 28:58.302
Let these womenfolk
look after you.

29:00.205 --> 29:02.740
That's good advice, ted.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.475
Don't mention it.

29:07.445 --> 29:08.912
People have their reasons

29:08.914 --> 29:10.347
For base jumping
and snake-handling.

29:10.349 --> 29:11.849
That doesn't mean their reasons
aren't stupid as shit!

29:11.851 --> 29:13.083
All right, amantha,
let's just...

29:13.085 --> 29:14.852
Hey. Hey, there.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.153
Hey.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.188
He got a little dizzy.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.823
Goodness.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.525
I thought I could help
a neighbor move a limb.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.793
What?

29:22.795 --> 29:24.128
I'm better now.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.996
Maybe you should sit.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.866
Okay.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.534
Hey, teddy.

29:30.536 --> 29:31.935
What brings you here?

29:31.937 --> 29:33.137
Oh, I, uh...

29:33.139 --> 29:34.938
Could I have a quick word
with you?

29:34.940 --> 29:36.907
Of course.
So...

29:36.909 --> 29:39.109
What were you thinking, daniel?

29:39.111 --> 29:40.778
Everything okay, teddy?

29:40.780 --> 29:42.079
Oh, yeah. It's fine.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.981
I thought I could help.

29:43.983 --> 29:46.350
No. When you said
that it wasn't bobby dean

29:46.352 --> 29:48.352
Who beat you
evidently senseless,

29:48.354 --> 29:49.820
What were you thinking?

29:49.822 --> 29:51.822
- What?
- Exactly, jared.

29:51.824 --> 29:55.425
Anyway, I've got
this great business plan.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.027
Oh.
Yes, ted mentioned it.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.529
Rims or something?

29:58.531 --> 30:00.531
Rim rentals. Yes, ma'am.
And it is...

30:00.533 --> 30:04.301
Make me understand this
on some semi-logical level.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.070
Half logic is...
is not logical.

30:07.072 --> 30:09.239
You want to give bobby dean
a second chance?

30:09.241 --> 30:10.808
Is that it?

30:10.810 --> 30:12.242
Death by boots.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.811
Yes, that's it, amantha.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.813
I'm sorry, teddy.
This isn't a good time.

30:15.815 --> 30:18.081
Of course. I...
if I could just get you...

30:18.083 --> 30:20.584
But whatever you and ted decide
is fine by me.

30:20.586 --> 30:21.885
I trust you.

30:21.887 --> 30:24.021
Why? Daniel, why?

30:24.023 --> 30:26.156
What good would it have done,
amantha?

30:26.158 --> 30:31.094
For one, bobby dean's skeezy ass
would be in jail right now.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.262
To what end?

30:32.264 --> 30:35.299
Do you like these, mother?

30:35.301 --> 30:39.069
Uh... Yes, I've always liked
those wedgewood stoves.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.205
He almost killed you, daniel.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.006
It doesn't matter.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.274
What doesn't?

30:44.276 --> 30:46.443
What would happen next, amantha?

30:46.445 --> 30:48.612
I mean,
bobby would go to prison,

30:48.614 --> 30:50.848
His mother would go to visit,

30:50.850 --> 30:53.884
And then after that,
and... and... and after that.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.586
When would it ever end?

30:55.588 --> 30:59.156
Now, that... I like...
I like this stove.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.425
Do you... do you like
this stove, jared?

31:01.427 --> 31:03.427
It's okay, I guess.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.030
You can't let him get away
with what he did to you.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.565
Who says he's getting away
with it?

31:08.567 --> 31:10.200
I like this tile, mother.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.236
Ted says we can't afford

31:12.238 --> 31:13.971
To have someone
do the kitchen right now.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.573
Oh, well,
there are other ways, mother.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.508
Hello?!

31:18.510 --> 31:20.510
You can't just...
I can, amantha!

31:20.512 --> 31:22.646
Listen to me.
I'm done with it.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.481
And you don't have to be.

31:24.483 --> 31:28.018
Bobby, the sheriff, the town...
you can all keep playing.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.520
I'm done with it.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.457
You think they're done with it?

31:33.459 --> 31:37.194
You think roland foulkes
is done with it?

31:37.196 --> 31:41.565
He is gonna come after you
again and again,

31:41.567 --> 31:44.534
And if you don't end up
in another hospital bed,

31:44.536 --> 31:45.936
You are gonna end up
in a courtroom.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.404
This is not a game, daniel!

31:47.406 --> 31:50.007
Isn't it?

31:50.009 --> 31:52.542
You're too sure about things,
amantha.

31:58.182 --> 32:00.150
This is absolutely insane!

32:00.152 --> 32:02.519
No.
We're the ones insane.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.254
Oh, honey.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.924
Well, this whole damn family...
we're a bunch of freaks.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.160
See what happens?

32:17.502 --> 32:21.405
Honestly, mother,
sometimes I think he...

32:21.407 --> 32:24.074
I don't know.
I don't know.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.342
I'm worried, honey.

32:25.344 --> 32:26.543
Finally.

32:26.545 --> 32:29.212
About you.
Me?

32:29.214 --> 32:32.249
Because I'm willing
to confront him,

32:32.251 --> 32:33.984
To... to ask him why?

32:33.986 --> 32:37.154
No. It's just...

32:37.156 --> 32:39.623
Maybe you should think
about heading back to atlanta

32:39.625 --> 32:41.191
By yourself for a while.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.360
Jobs are hard to find
around here anyway.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.228
What?

32:45.230 --> 32:50.167
Might be best if you got
some time away from all of it.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.736
From daniel, you mean?

32:52.738 --> 32:55.439
From the family?

32:55.441 --> 32:58.041
Just think about it.

33:21.265 --> 33:22.766
Sorry everything's cold.

33:22.768 --> 33:26.103
Uh, it takes a while to get it
through all of the...

33:26.105 --> 33:27.337
Protocol.

33:27.339 --> 33:33.043
Strip-searched
my hash browns, huh?

33:33.045 --> 33:35.712
Bunch of animals.

33:35.714 --> 33:39.516
No small thing,
bringing me this food.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.185
Kindness for a dead man.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.054
Not a problem.

33:44.056 --> 33:46.023
Sure it ain't.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.263
What?

33:53.265 --> 33:55.399
Why, hollis?

33:55.401 --> 33:57.734
You a priest now or something?

33:57.736 --> 34:00.670
Looking for
a deathbed confession?

34:00.672 --> 34:04.408
Why did you keep saying
it wasn't your dna?

34:04.410 --> 34:06.076
I don't know.

34:06.078 --> 34:09.813
Seemed like my only option,
I guess.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.380
But it wasn't an option.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.483
It was your dna,
and you knew it.

34:13.485 --> 34:18.121
Not my best-laid plan, jonny.
I'll give you that.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.556
Do you know how much money
we spent?

34:20.559 --> 34:22.826
How many people believed in you?

34:22.828 --> 34:28.732
Your... your mother,
your sister, us?

34:28.734 --> 34:30.300
Yeah, I feel bad about that now.

34:30.302 --> 34:33.335
Do you?

34:33.338 --> 34:36.406
Not really, to be honest.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.643
That's the first thing you said
that I believe, hollis.

34:42.447 --> 34:47.150
Okay, mr. Stern
a little parting gift...

34:47.152 --> 34:50.387
I'm wired different, jon.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.523
Have been as long
as I can remember.

34:53.525 --> 34:56.092
Who knows why?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.161
Daddy left, mama crazy,

34:58.163 --> 35:01.798
Got dropped on my head...
none of the above.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.101
Doesn't really matter, does it?

35:04.103 --> 35:05.569
Just is.

35:05.571 --> 35:09.106
So it's fun to pretend,
you know?

35:09.108 --> 35:11.741
Pretend I was normal.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.613
Have y'all treat me
like I was human,

35:16.615 --> 35:20.517
Like I was something other
than the monster they say I am.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.853
That shit gets old.

35:25.490 --> 35:29.126
Anyhow, it's fun to pretend.

35:29.128 --> 35:31.428
Simple as that.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.641
You like watching me?

36:17.643 --> 36:19.809
You into that kind of thing?

36:19.811 --> 36:24.447
Pondering things, bobby.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.950
Go ponder somewhere else.

36:26.952 --> 36:31.188
Just one question, though,
before I go.

36:31.190 --> 36:34.357
The thing I was pondering.

36:37.628 --> 36:40.497
What are you gonna do
when you get out?

36:40.499 --> 36:42.632
Get out?

36:42.634 --> 36:44.334
Yeah.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.937
You're bound to get out
sooner or later, right?

36:46.939 --> 36:48.805
Maybe 10 years from now,

36:48.807 --> 36:52.709
7 or 8 if you're lucky,
you play the game.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.412
Good behavior.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.781
So what are you gonna do?

36:59.317 --> 37:01.451
Who the hell knows?

37:03.254 --> 37:04.888
Come on, now.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.890
Surely
you've thought about this.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.392
I don't ponder things, sheriff.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.528
Apparently, that's <i> your</i> job.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.597
You gonna be a firefighter?

37:13.599 --> 37:15.632
Or a schoolteacher?

37:15.634 --> 37:19.569
Maybe a cowboy.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.538
Excuse me?

37:21.540 --> 37:25.809
It's a simple question, bobby.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.811
Are you gonna make something
of your life,

37:27.813 --> 37:30.247
Or are you gonna be
a complete waste of space

37:30.249 --> 37:31.948
Like those assholes
you run with?

37:34.285 --> 37:38.822
You talk awful tough from
behind those bars, sheriff.

37:38.824 --> 37:44.694
I'm asking you if your life
is worth saving, bobby dean.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.896
Are you worth saving?

37:49.800 --> 37:52.335
I don't know, sheriff.

37:56.742 --> 37:59.276
Well, you better figure it out.

38:01.579 --> 38:03.913
'cause you just got saved.

38:05.916 --> 38:07.617
Go on.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.420
I mean it.
Go on. Get processed out.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.956
Daniel holden
said it wasn't you.

38:16.894 --> 38:18.595
I know.

38:18.597 --> 38:22.399
So go on.
I ain't gonna tell you again.

38:26.470 --> 38:30.807
You know, in some cultures,
you'd be obliged to him now.

38:34.578 --> 38:36.546
Not in this one.

39:01.472 --> 39:03.506
Salud, gentlemen.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.715
Open your mouth.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.051
Wider.

39:57.796 --> 40:00.764
Ma'am?

40:00.766 --> 40:05.735
Ma'am?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.704
You got to "ma'am" me tonight?

40:07.706 --> 40:09.472
I wasn't trying to.

40:09.474 --> 40:11.674
We need to go ahead and close
up, if you don't mind.

40:11.676 --> 40:19.676
Why would I?
