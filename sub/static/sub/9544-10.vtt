MONK Season 3 Epi. 10
Mr. Monk and the Red Herring

03:37.896 --> 03:41.650
It's been three months.
How are you holding up?

03:43.021 --> 03:46.143
Well, I've made a decision. - Good.

03:46.856 --> 03:51.283
When she comes back, I'm not gonna
pay her for the weeks she missed.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.166
I have to draw the line.

03:53.201 --> 03:55.945
- I'm docking her pay.
- Adrian...

03:57.124 --> 04:00.224
- Sharona is not coming back.
- She'll be back.

04:01.072 --> 04:02.256
Believe me.

04:02.291 --> 04:06.107
I, I think I know her
a lot better than you do.

04:08.847 --> 04:13.131
Didn't she sell her house? - Yes.

04:13.166 --> 04:18.613
And she moved back
to New Jersey. - Yes.

04:18.648 --> 04:22.725
And she remarried her ex-husband.

04:26.455 --> 04:28.372
I'm not sure I like
where you're going here.

04:28.407 --> 04:30.861
Adrian, Sharona is
moving on with her life,

04:30.896 --> 04:33.947
and if you loved her,
you'd be happy for her.

04:38.226 --> 04:40.806
She wasn't just my assistant.

04:40.841 --> 04:43.306
I know. - When she found me,

04:43.341 --> 04:45.541
I was drowning.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.706
- She saved my life.
- I know.

04:47.741 --> 04:50.304
I know. I was there.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.715
You're a doctor.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.508
Can't you make her come back?

04:55.543 --> 04:56.921
What would you like me to do?

04:56.936 --> 05:00.403
Fly back to New Jersey
and drug her,

05:00.438 --> 05:03.552
bring her back here?

05:05.547 --> 05:07.139
No.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.927
But thank you.

05:12.190 --> 05:14.957
She's pretty smart.
She'd probably escape.

05:14.992 --> 05:18.876
Adrian, you were
lucky to know her.

05:18.911 --> 05:22.493
And I know you'll always be grateful,
but it's time for you to move on.

05:22.528 --> 05:26.265
You've gotta start looking
for your new assistant. - Impossible.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.039
Yeah, well, that's what you said
before you found Sharona.

05:29.074 --> 05:31.217
But, Adrian, you've got
to start looking.

05:31.252 --> 05:33.940
Your new assistant
is out there somewhere.

05:38.492 --> 05:40.448
God help her.

05:40.483 --> 05:42.747
I've been a registered
nurse for 14 years.

05:42.782 --> 05:44.095
These are my references.

05:48.026 --> 05:51.194
Your staple's...
crooked.

05:51.229 --> 05:54.505
I've been voted California nurse of
the year three years in a row.

05:54.540 --> 05:57.201
Mm-hmm, yeah.
What's up with this staple?

05:57.236 --> 06:00.163
You're looking for someone
to start right away? - That's right.

06:00.198 --> 06:03.335
What would my hours be? - 9 A. M...

06:04.395 --> 06:07.206
- until?
- Until one...

06:07.241 --> 06:10.715
- 1 P. M?
- Until one of us dies.

06:16.499 --> 06:17.839
So who was he?

06:17.874 --> 06:20.572
So far he's John Doe.
No wallet, no I. D.

06:20.607 --> 06:22.147
We're running the prints now.

06:23.080 --> 06:26.194
Miss Teeger, I'd like
to go through the story.

06:26.229 --> 06:30.332
Um, you heard a noise,
you came to check it out.

06:30.367 --> 06:32.383
He comes, he grabs you
from behind. - Right.

06:32.418 --> 06:34.995
You struggle. Now, there were some
scissors on that table.

06:35.030 --> 06:36.703
What were they doing there?

06:36.738 --> 06:40.161
Julie, my daughter, was
working on a school project.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.256
- Where's the girl?
- She's with a neighbor.

06:42.291 --> 06:44.573
- Didn't see anything.
- Good.

06:45.385 --> 06:47.299
So you grabbed the scissors
and you stabbed him?

06:47.334 --> 06:49.057
I wasn't trying to kill him.

06:49.756 --> 06:52.014
Maybe I was.
I, I don't know.

06:52.049 --> 06:53.291
Natalie.

06:53.326 --> 06:55.545
You had every right
to defend yourself.

06:56.956 --> 07:00.629
- where's your husband?
- Uh, he died.

07:00.664 --> 07:06.022
Uh, six years ago.
He's a, uh, was a navy pilot.

07:06.691 --> 07:08.760
- I'm sorry.
- Captain, why are they doing this?

07:08.795 --> 07:10.569
- What do they want from me?
- Who's "they"?

07:10.604 --> 07:13.701
There was, uh...
another intruder two days ago.

07:13.736 --> 07:15.590
On Tuesday, a man
came to my house.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.510
He said he was here
to check my water meter.

07:17.545 --> 07:19.380
But he didn't go downstairs.

07:19.415 --> 07:21.641
I, I caught him over there
just looking around.

07:21.676 --> 07:23.684
But when he saw me,
he ran out the back door.

07:23.719 --> 07:26.301
We called water and power,
but there's no record.

07:26.336 --> 07:28.227
And this was a different guy? - Yeah.

07:28.262 --> 07:30.089
You're sure about that? - Yeah.

07:30.124 --> 07:31.971
Sir.

07:32.627 --> 07:34.130
There's gotta be a connection here.

07:34.165 --> 07:35.652
Do you know the odds
against two different men

07:35.687 --> 07:38.514
breaking into the same house
in the same week?

07:39.234 --> 07:41.645
No, I don't. Do you?

07:41.680 --> 07:43.139
No.

07:44.190 --> 07:46.167
Is there anything of value
in your house?

07:46.202 --> 07:48.151
Yeah. My daughter.

07:48.186 --> 07:50.942
Of course. I mean
cash or jewelry?

07:51.469 --> 07:53.616
- Medicine?
- No.

07:53.651 --> 07:55.451
- Drugs?
- No.

07:55.486 --> 07:56.617
And you've never seen
these men before?

07:56.652 --> 07:59.704
Either this guy or
the meter guy? - No.

08:00.483 --> 08:02.831
Huh.

08:03.732 --> 08:08.036
Miss Teeger, there's a person
we sometimes bring in.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.265
He's a former detective.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.748
He sort of specializes
in cases like this.

08:13.783 --> 08:15.499
Great, let's call him.

08:15.945 --> 08:18.937
It's not that easy.
You see, he's, uh,

08:18.972 --> 08:20.230
he's taking some time off.

08:20.265 --> 08:24.518
He's sort of working through
one or two personal issues right now.

08:24.553 --> 08:27.757
But I think if you were to talk
to him and ask him yourself,

08:27.792 --> 08:30.030
he might change his mind.

08:30.065 --> 08:32.878
Mr. Monk, I'm a little
confused. - Me, too.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.539
See, I'm a registered nurse.

08:34.573 --> 08:37.529
And physically, you seem to be fine.

08:37.563 --> 08:39.118
Are you looking for a housekeeper?

08:39.153 --> 08:40.821
No, what? No, no.

08:40.856 --> 08:42.428
I, I, I can clean the house.

08:42.462 --> 08:45.275
Don't worry about that.
That's covered.

08:45.310 --> 08:47.591
She didn't give me any notice.

08:47.626 --> 08:51.919
I guess she was worried that
I'd have a nervous breakdown or...

08:51.954 --> 08:56.169
But, but her son, Benjy, he...
he gave me this letter.

08:56.204 --> 08:58.332
- He left me this.
- It's in a baggie.

08:58.367 --> 09:01.588
It's an evidence bag.
Read the P. S.

09:01.623 --> 09:03.848
- Did you read the P. S.?
- Yeah, it's heartbreaking.

09:03.883 --> 09:06.326
Uh, Mr. Monk, can I be
honest with you?

09:06.361 --> 09:08.900
- I wish you wouldn't.
- I've had tons of patients like you.

09:08.935 --> 09:11.335
There is nothing wrong with you.
It's all up here.

09:11.370 --> 09:13.177
- It's psychological.
- Right, right.

09:13.212 --> 09:15.117
What you really need is a wife.

09:15.152 --> 09:18.157
Oh, whoa. Uh, we just met.
Okay? I don't even know you.

09:18.192 --> 09:21.414
It's not me. I'm not proposing to you.
It's a statement of fact.

09:21.449 --> 09:22.993
- Excuse me.
- you gotta stop whining, you know?

09:23.028 --> 09:26.056
- There, there's no smoking. - Sharona
moved away, wah, wah, wah. You know what?

09:26.091 --> 09:29.465
You have got to get out of the house.
You gotta do something.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.253
Go bowling.
You know, meet some people.

09:31.288 --> 09:34.044
- That is my advice to you.
- You gotta, you gotta put that out!

09:34.079 --> 09:37.304
All right. Don't get
all twisted up.

09:40.763 --> 09:43.642
There. It's out.
And so am I.

09:43.677 --> 09:46.059
Another morning shot to hell.

09:55.580 --> 09:58.086
Hold upright.
Pull away pin.

09:58.121 --> 10:00.437
Stand eight feet from the flame.

10:00.472 --> 10:04.239
One, two, three, four...

10:06.005 --> 10:07.278
Hello?

10:08.449 --> 10:09.579
Mr. Monk?

10:11.096 --> 10:14.266
- Hello? Mr. Monk?
- One, two, three...

10:14.301 --> 10:15.765
Are you okay?

10:15.800 --> 10:17.631
- What are you doing?
- Measuring.

10:17.666 --> 10:19.017
It says eight feet, stay back!

10:19.052 --> 10:21.887
You know, they, they mean
approximately. - No, no.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.563
It doesn't say approximately.

10:23.598 --> 10:26.354
You have to trust the label makers,
professional label makers.

10:26.389 --> 10:29.611
- Just give me that!
- Wait a second, you're too close!

10:34.372 --> 10:36.165
Are you okay?

10:37.374 --> 10:38.823
We did it.

10:40.902 --> 10:43.497
I'm gonna write
these people a letter.

10:43.532 --> 10:45.585
We could've been killed.

10:45.620 --> 10:47.086
They should say "approximately."

10:47.121 --> 10:49.872
- Are you Monk?
- Yeah.

10:49.907 --> 10:52.120
- Adrian Monk?
- Right.

10:52.155 --> 10:53.985
The detective?

10:54.329 --> 10:57.352
The famous, admired,
respected detective?

11:00.554 --> 11:05.343
If you still want the job,
we can go talk in the kitchen.

11:06.483 --> 11:09.072
- What job?
- Aren't you here from the agency?

11:09.107 --> 11:12.180
No. I came here to hire you.

11:12.604 --> 11:14.620
I'm Natalie Teeger.

11:15.951 --> 11:19.608
Captain Stottlemeyer said that
you might be able to help me. - No.

11:19.643 --> 11:22.058
He said you were the best cop
he's ever met.

11:22.629 --> 11:24.661
I guess he's never seen
you put out a fire.

11:24.696 --> 11:29.035
Well, I'm sorry, but, um, I'm not
really taking any work right now.

11:29.070 --> 11:32.323
I recently lost a dear friend.

11:34.582 --> 11:39.129
Oh. I'm so sorry.
Who died?

11:39.164 --> 11:42.445
Nobody died.
My nurse quit.

11:43.973 --> 11:47.903
The captain said you might
change your mind. - Well...

11:47.938 --> 11:49.392
Okay, look, I can pay you.

11:49.427 --> 11:51.771
I'm not rich, but I can
borrow money if I have to.

11:51.806 --> 11:53.353
No. - I can take out a loan.

11:53.388 --> 11:57.233
I can't. Um, I just, I can't.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.032
There was a man
in my house last night. I killed him.

12:04.984 --> 12:07.988
There was another man in
my house a couple of days ago.

12:08.023 --> 12:12.088
They're after something.
I can't figure it out.

12:12.123 --> 12:13.928
Nobody can.

12:13.963 --> 12:16.037
Do you have kids? - No.

12:16.072 --> 12:17.680
I do.

12:17.715 --> 12:19.620
I have an 11-year-old daughter.

12:21.065 --> 12:23.417
Mr. Monk, I don't say
this very often.

12:24.726 --> 12:27.223
- I'm scared.
- Yeah, look.

12:27.258 --> 12:28.740
Please, help me.

12:29.861 --> 12:32.683
Please, help us.

13:08.530 --> 13:09.927
It's okay.

13:38.114 --> 13:41.504
Is there money in the house? - No.

13:41.539 --> 13:44.380
What about the coffee can?
Isn't that where you hide your money?

13:45.050 --> 13:46.804
How did you know that?

13:46.839 --> 13:50.891
There's coffee grounds on the counter
indicating that it's been opened recently,

13:50.926 --> 13:54.523
but you don't have a coffeemaker.

13:55.186 --> 13:57.557
Wow, he's like Velma
from Scooby-doo.

13:57.592 --> 13:59.648
I, I had money in there,

13:59.683 --> 14:02.105
but I spent in on luxury items
like food and rent.

14:08.110 --> 14:10.032
You grew 5/8s of an inch.

14:14.325 --> 14:17.277
- Your husband was in the navy?
- Yeah, he died six years ago.

14:17.312 --> 14:18.523
He was a pilot.

14:24.174 --> 14:26.883
And you recently started dating again.

14:29.885 --> 14:32.097
- How did you know that?
- It's patently obvious.

14:32.132 --> 14:37.114
I happened to notice
these in your coat pocket.

14:38.655 --> 14:40.789
Birth control pills.

14:47.195 --> 14:49.515
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I can't believe you just did that!

14:49.550 --> 14:52.485
Right in front of my daughter?
What is wrong with you?

14:52.520 --> 14:54.287
Do you have, like,
zero social skills?

14:54.322 --> 14:56.299
Mom, it's okay.
I'm not a baby.

14:57.236 --> 14:58.844
Wait a minute!

14:58.879 --> 15:00.832
Wait a minute.
Oh, my mistake.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.505
These are not birth control pills.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.926
These are, these are Tic-tacs.

15:04.961 --> 15:08.565
Just little pink and green
Tic-tac candies.

15:09.091 --> 15:11.055
But don't eat them. They're...

15:11.090 --> 15:15.151
They're special, adult,
you know, Tic-tacs

15:23.204 --> 15:24.533
Detective Monk, what...

15:24.568 --> 15:26.383
What do you think
these guys are after?

15:26.418 --> 15:27.744
I don't know.

15:28.734 --> 15:32.043
Okay, we, we have two intruders?

15:33.055 --> 15:36.418
One last night, one two days ago.
Both in this room?

15:36.453 --> 15:40.537
- Where were they exactly?
- Uh, just around the television,

15:53.428 --> 15:54.584
Is this yours?

15:55.350 --> 15:57.444
Um, no, mine's over there.

16:05.521 --> 16:07.696
It's brand-new.
It's never been used.

16:07.731 --> 16:09.948
I can't believe all those
detectives missed that.

16:09.983 --> 16:15.264
Well, they probably saw it.
They just didn't give it a second thought.

16:15.299 --> 16:18.655
- Do you have a baggie?
- Uh, yes.

16:32.107 --> 16:34.090
Is this light always on?

16:34.660 --> 16:38.245
Actually, it was off last night.
I didn't turn it on. - Me neither.

16:38.624 --> 16:41.846
- Tell me about the fish.
- His name is Mr. Henry.

16:41.881 --> 16:44.061
My father gave him to me.

16:44.096 --> 16:45.608
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:45.643 --> 16:47.873
You think they're after the fish?

16:48.564 --> 16:50.231
Why?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.312
You smell that?
What is that?

17:01.347 --> 17:02.470
It's a pet store.

17:02.505 --> 17:04.964
Haven't you ever been
in a pet store? - No.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.194
What have you been doing?

17:06.229 --> 17:08.782
For one thing, I've been
avoiding pet stores.

17:08.818 --> 17:10.820
- Hey, Carl.
- Hello, Mrs. Teeger.

17:10.856 --> 17:13.128
Hey. I wanna talk to you
about this fish.

17:13.436 --> 17:17.679
Is there anything special? Anything
unusual about him I should know?

17:17.984 --> 17:19.721
Like what? Is he sick?

17:19.756 --> 17:22.195
- He looks okay to me.
- No, no, I mean,

17:22.231 --> 17:25.348
- is he valuable?
- He's just a marble fish, Mrs. Teeger.

17:25.383 --> 17:28.403
We sell them for 99 cents.
We got about a thousand of them.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.730
- If you'd like your money back..
- No, Carl, I'm not returning him.

17:30.765 --> 17:35.813
Is there any reason why someone
might want this particular fish?

17:35.848 --> 17:38.400
I mean, really, really want him?

17:38.915 --> 17:42.402
Uh, well, he's sorta pretty.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.962
And he's got a thin, black
stripe on his dorsal fin...

17:44.997 --> 17:46.832
Mr. Monk, what do you think?

17:47.747 --> 17:49.124
Mr. Monk?

17:49.159 --> 17:50.842
Look at this guy.

17:50.877 --> 17:54.009
He's eating out of two
trays at one time.

17:54.044 --> 17:58.464
He's keeping them even.
They're perfectly even.

17:58.499 --> 18:00.145
Yeah, it's sergeant pepper.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.711
Hey, you want him?
You can have him for free.

18:01.746 --> 18:04.180
We can't get rid of him.
Customers keep bringing him back.

18:04.215 --> 18:05.932
How come?

18:06.390 --> 18:07.867
Mm, he's depressing,
he doesn't talk,

18:07.902 --> 18:11.078
he just mopes around, cleaning himself,
straightening up his cage.

18:11.693 --> 18:14.263
His cage always has to be perfect.

18:14.570 --> 18:17.464
- What's wrong with him?
- His wife died.

18:18.559 --> 18:21.073
Yeah. That's right.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.155
We had a female in there with him.
She died about a year ago.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.471
He hasn't been the same ever since.

18:25.506 --> 18:28.823
Well, why don't you put another
female in there? - It won't work.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.547
He'll never feel the same way
about anybody else.

18:31.582 --> 18:33.290
Yeah, that's right.

18:33.325 --> 18:34.878
We tried it, but...

18:34.913 --> 18:39.512
I'm afraid sergeant pepper's just gonna
grow old and die alone in his little cage.

18:46.591 --> 18:49.146
So what was her name?

18:50.017 --> 18:51.769
Trudy.

18:59.985 --> 19:01.229
It's a goldfish.

19:01.264 --> 19:04.617
Well, technically,
it's a crimson marble fish.

19:04.652 --> 19:06.009
Is it extinct?

19:06.609 --> 19:09.748
If it was extinct, we wouldn't
be looking at it, would we?

19:09.783 --> 19:14.242
Is it rare? Valuable? - Costs about a
dollar. Any pet store has a hundred of them.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.221
I don't know.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.260
He brought a fishing net into the house.

19:18.295 --> 19:20.124
And he turned on the light
over the aquarium.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.672
Well, does anybody have any ideas?

19:21.707 --> 19:24.352
Maybe it swallowed something.
Like, a diamond.

19:24.387 --> 19:27.175
Does anybody besides Randy
have any ideas?

19:27.210 --> 19:28.683
Monk, come here.

19:31.145 --> 19:33.986
Look, how's it going?
I've been worried about you.

19:34.021 --> 19:36.604
No, uh, I've been worried
about me, too.

19:36.639 --> 19:39.236
How are those interviews going?
Did you find anybody?

19:39.271 --> 19:41.145
I've narrowed it down.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.743
To nobody.

19:45.193 --> 19:48.206
Whatever happened with your wife's
niece? The one who's the nurse?

19:48.241 --> 19:50.869
- She never called me.
- Yeah, I know. Um...

19:52.805 --> 19:54.748
here's the thing, Monk.

19:55.255 --> 19:57.512
- I love her.
- I understand.

19:57.547 --> 19:59.012
Captain!

19:59.047 --> 20:02.302
We IDed the intruder that, uh,
miss teeger killed.

20:02.337 --> 20:05.043
Brian Lemmon.
Minor league creep.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.050
- Does that ring a bell?
- Nah, never heard of him.

20:07.085 --> 20:09.140
One, two, three...

20:09.175 --> 20:11.396
five falls.

20:11.431 --> 20:14.046
Couple of B&E's and receiving
stolen property.

20:14.081 --> 20:16.471
Was there an address book
or anything in his wallet?

20:16.506 --> 20:20.039
- No wallet, no keys.
- This is, uh, all we found.

20:20.074 --> 20:23.503
- It was in his back pocket.
- "2:30 Sea of Tranquility."

20:23.538 --> 20:25.964
- What is that? A club?
- No, I don't think so.

20:25.999 --> 20:29.386
Who'd want to go to a club called
the Sea of Tranquility? Besides you.

20:29.421 --> 20:31.712
I think it's some kind
of spa or holistic retreat...

20:31.747 --> 20:34.293
No, it's not a spa?
It's an exhibit at the science museum.

20:34.328 --> 20:36.904
My kid went there last
week on a field trip.

20:46.308 --> 20:49.005
Mitch wanted to be an astronaut.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.977
That was his dream.

20:51.765 --> 20:54.252
Three days after
his plane went down,

20:54.287 --> 20:56.689
he got a registered letter from NASA.

20:57.134 --> 20:59.696
He'd been accepted into
their training program.

21:01.946 --> 21:05.656
- It hurts, I know.
- Life goes on.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.086
Doesn't it?

21:13.544 --> 21:15.783
Hello! I'm a white corpuscle!

21:15.818 --> 21:18.328
I'm an important part of
your body's defense system.

21:18.363 --> 21:22.844
I travel through your bloodstream
and I fight bacteria and diseases.

21:22.879 --> 21:24.881
Would you like to know more about me?

21:24.916 --> 21:27.381
No. I'd like to know less about you.

21:43.364 --> 21:46.072
They weren't big on dental
hygiene, were they?

21:49.490 --> 21:51.238
- Natalie.
- Hm?

21:52.009 --> 21:54.379
This man didn't freeze to death.

21:55.427 --> 21:57.131
He was murdered.

21:57.166 --> 21:59.666
There's a puncture wound
in the side of his skull.

21:59.701 --> 22:01.456
It was over 30,000 years ago.

22:01.491 --> 22:04.297
Well, there's no statute
of limitations on murder.

22:08.548 --> 22:09.939
I think I know what happened.

22:09.974 --> 22:12.615
Detective Monk, why don't
we solve my case first?

22:12.650 --> 22:15.576
Then we'll come back here later
and figure out who killed Og, okay?

22:22.543 --> 22:24.850
Welcome to the Sea of Tranquility,

22:25.751 --> 22:28.858
where, on July 20th, 1969,

22:28.893 --> 22:32.607
commander Neil Armstrong took
one small step for man,

22:32.642 --> 22:35.706
one giant leap for mankind.

22:35.741 --> 22:39.510
Those of us that are old enough
to have seen it will never forget it.

22:39.545 --> 22:42.090
Now, over here is
the highlight of our exhibit.

22:42.125 --> 22:44.446
This is an actual moon rock

22:44.481 --> 22:47.543
that was brought back
by the crew of Apollo 11.

22:47.578 --> 22:51.995
There are only 234 moon rocks
that were brought back to planet Earth.

22:52.030 --> 22:54.632
And we've cut a little hole here
in the side of the exhibit

22:54.667 --> 22:57.601
so that you can reach in with your
fingers and touch it if you want to.

22:58.238 --> 22:59.939
That's the guy.

22:59.974 --> 23:02.560
- Who, the tour guide?
- He's the meter reader.

23:02.595 --> 23:04.867
That's the guy that
was in my house.

23:11.896 --> 23:14.813
This is called a plasma sphere.

23:14.848 --> 23:18.509
And inside the sphere,
there are millions of ions reacting

23:18.544 --> 23:21.865
to the electrical charge to create what?

23:21.900 --> 23:25.686
- You said the meter man had black hair.
- He must've been wearing a wig.

23:25.721 --> 23:28.921
But that's the guy. I work in a bar.
I'm good with faces.

23:29.958 --> 23:32.150
Maybe we should say something.
See how he reacts.

23:32.185 --> 23:34.835
No, if he is the guy,
we don't want him to know we know.

23:34.870 --> 23:37.190
- Okay.
- Let's go.

23:37.225 --> 23:39.569
Welcome to the Miracle of Birth.

23:39.604 --> 23:42.498
Sexual reproduction is
the fertilization of the female egg...

23:42.533 --> 23:44.556
We're gonna step carefully
through this opening into the womb,

23:44.591 --> 23:48.108
and then we're gonna take
a left up the fallopian tubes.

23:49.322 --> 23:51.408
Here we go.

23:51.443 --> 23:53.709
Do it carefully. That's it.
Turn sideways if you have to.

23:53.744 --> 23:55.191
Now you're in the womb.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.944
Go left up the fallopian tubes.

23:58.442 --> 24:00.501
There we go.

24:03.965 --> 24:06.571
Welcome to the Miracle of Birth.

24:06.606 --> 24:08.541
Oh, no.
No, no.

24:08.576 --> 24:10.586
Detective Monk, hurry up.
He's getting away!

24:11.918 --> 24:13.819
You are standing in the uterus...

24:13.854 --> 24:15.677
Hurry!

24:21.723 --> 24:23.120
What are you doing?

24:25.030 --> 24:26.776
Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait.

24:26.811 --> 24:28.279
Wait, listen.

24:28.314 --> 24:30.947
Maybe I should've mentioned
this earlier, but...

24:30.982 --> 24:33.003
I, see, the thing is,

24:33.038 --> 24:34.946
I have a number of phobias.

24:34.981 --> 24:36.646
- You? No.
- Oh, yes.

24:36.681 --> 24:38.323
Yes, and one of them,

24:38.358 --> 24:43.037
near the top of the list, actually,
is the miracle of birth.

24:43.072 --> 24:46.591
You're gonna be okay.
Just take my hand.

24:49.411 --> 24:51.040
Okay, fetus ahead!

24:53.601 --> 24:56.589
Oh, no!
Ooh, I can't go up there.

24:57.306 --> 24:59.193
Ah, I, I don't even know this woman.

24:59.228 --> 25:01.101
Okay, but we're gonna lose him!

25:01.684 --> 25:03.877
- Pretend you're in a funhouse!
- Funhouse, no.

25:03.912 --> 25:06.273
What's fun about fallopian tubes?

25:06.308 --> 25:09.062
I can't, I gotta...
I can't now.

25:09.568 --> 25:10.779
Okay, you know what,
just forget it, okay?

25:10.814 --> 25:14.388
- We're outta here.
- Okay.

25:14.423 --> 25:17.401
No, no, no. We have to go
through the pelvis.

25:17.436 --> 25:19.199
I think this is gonna be a cesarean.

25:26.201 --> 25:27.996
Here he is.
Lyle Peck, tour guide.

25:28.031 --> 25:32.130
Okay, all right. I will have
the captain run a check on him.

25:32.165 --> 25:34.033
I can't believe you
freaked out like that.

25:34.068 --> 25:36.584
Human sexuality is a natural thing.

25:37.010 --> 25:39.880
Well, we disagree about that.

25:59.947 --> 26:02.802
Are you hungry?
Here you go.

26:03.244 --> 26:05.926
You bought this kit in the gift
shop at the museum?

26:05.961 --> 26:06.933
Uh-huh.

26:06.968 --> 26:09.623
Was the box open
when you bought it?

26:09.658 --> 26:11.123
Maybe, I don't know.

26:11.158 --> 26:13.301
You think they're after
something from the kit?

26:13.336 --> 26:16.617
Well, Peck works at the museum.
He might've stashed something in the box,

26:16.652 --> 26:18.091
and now he's trying to get it back.

26:18.126 --> 26:21.183
Honey, when you bought this,
did you give them your name?

26:21.218 --> 26:23.521
I might've signed a mailing list.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.898
What exactly was in the kit?

26:27.933 --> 26:29.800
Um, a rock, a treasure chest,

26:29.835 --> 26:32.939
a deep sea diver, and some gravel.

26:32.974 --> 26:36.784
- Look in the treasure chest.
- Nah, nothing.

26:36.819 --> 26:39.451
- What about the gravel?
- I don't see it.

26:40.433 --> 26:44.031
I'd like to take this whole
aquarium back to the lab. - Okay.

26:44.066 --> 26:45.946
Oh, wait, you know what,
you can't.

26:45.981 --> 26:48.081
Uh, there's a science fair
at Julie's school tonight.

26:48.116 --> 26:51.388
- This is her project.
- Not anymore.

26:51.423 --> 26:54.628
- What do you mean?
- Mr. Franklin disqualified me.

26:54.663 --> 26:56.691
He disqualified you?

27:07.703 --> 27:10.524
Mr. Franklin, I'm Natalie Teeger.
I'm Julie's mother.

27:10.559 --> 27:13.560
Oh, yes.
I remember you from parents' night.

27:13.595 --> 27:15.808
Excuse the mess.
We've been making volcanoes.

27:15.843 --> 27:19.195
Did you tell Julie that she couldn't
bring her fish to the science fair?

27:19.874 --> 27:23.000
Yes. I did.

27:23.035 --> 27:25.276
Mrs. Teeger, sit, please.

27:27.538 --> 27:29.638
Or stand. That's fine.

27:30.421 --> 27:32.282
Mrs. Teeger, you need to understand

27:32.317 --> 27:35.954
I teach science, not science fiction.

27:35.989 --> 27:39.199
I can't approve a project
if a student is just making things up.

27:39.234 --> 27:40.896
Are you saying Julie is lying?

27:40.931 --> 27:44.421
I don't know what to say.
I've seen Julie's fish.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.924
It's an ordinary crimson marble fish.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.226
She said she's had it
since she was five.

27:50.060 --> 27:52.266
- Yeah, that's right.
- That's impossible.

27:52.301 --> 27:55.204
A marble fish lives a year,
year and a half at most.

27:55.239 --> 27:57.854
Either Julie's mistaken, or she's
trying to pull a fast one.

27:57.889 --> 28:01.172
Either way, I have an obligation
to my other students.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.120
What are you doing?

28:12.155 --> 28:15.796
- Well, I was not happy about the way...
- Okay, you know, it doesn't matter.

28:15.831 --> 28:17.421
What do you call
a guy who studies fish?

28:17.456 --> 28:20.339
- An ichthyologist.
- That's what you are.

28:20.374 --> 28:22.472
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

28:22.507 --> 28:25.266
I really don't think I am. - Yeah,
for the next five minutes, you are.

28:25.301 --> 28:26.864
I need you to tell Julie's teacher

28:26.899 --> 28:29.904
that a marble fish can live
longer than two years, okay?

28:29.939 --> 28:31.604
Wait a minute, what?

28:31.639 --> 28:34.938
Wait, Natalie.
Wait a second. Wait.

28:34.973 --> 28:37.312
Here's the thing.
Uh, I can't lie.

28:37.347 --> 28:40.063
Uh, I'm not good at it.
I got lucky with that Tic-tac thing.

28:40.098 --> 28:41.547
- Are you a man?
- Am I...

28:41.582 --> 28:44.091
- Are you a man?
- Yes.

28:44.126 --> 28:46.060
Then you can lie.
That's what men do.

28:48.079 --> 28:49.478
Mr. Franklin?

28:49.513 --> 28:51.582
Uh, when Julie told me about your problem,

28:51.617 --> 28:55.640
I called Berkeley and talked to the
science department, and found my own expert.

28:55.675 --> 28:58.720
This is professor Larry Tilburn.

28:58.755 --> 29:01.162
He was kind enough to
meet me here this morning.

29:01.197 --> 29:04.131
- Hi.
- Hello.

29:08.176 --> 29:11.028
- He's an ick... icky...
- Ichthyologist.

29:11.063 --> 29:13.203
Ichthyologist.
He's world renowned.

29:13.238 --> 29:18.440
Has written just a page-turner
of a book on fresh water fish. - Really?

29:18.475 --> 29:19.934
What's it called?

29:21.739 --> 29:27.588
- Fresh water fish, by Larry Tilburn.
- Great title.

29:27.623 --> 29:30.360
I tried to read it,
and just forget it.

29:35.994 --> 29:37.220
Professor?

29:38.783 --> 29:40.980
Professor Tilburn?

29:41.015 --> 29:42.470
Professor Tilburn.

29:43.552 --> 29:45.959
Mr. Franklin here doesn't
think that Julie's fish...

29:46.377 --> 29:48.126
you know the one
that I showed you,

29:48.161 --> 29:50.193
could live longer
than a year or two.

29:50.949 --> 29:53.424
What do you think?

29:54.633 --> 29:56.934
- I think it can.
- I don't see how.

29:57.265 --> 29:59.633
It's a common variety marble fish.

29:59.668 --> 30:03.357
Has a miniscule genome size
and almost no immune system.

30:05.428 --> 30:08.321
Let's go.
Let's get outta here.

30:09.550 --> 30:11.275
That's true.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.569
That's true about most marble fish.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.427
But this is a completely
different species.

30:17.462 --> 30:22.936
This is the north korean marble fish.

30:22.971 --> 30:24.741
North korean?

30:25.228 --> 30:27.811
It's a very strong fish.

30:27.846 --> 30:30.390
It's a very tough fish.

30:30.425 --> 30:34.238
Would have to be to live
in a country like, uh...

30:34.883 --> 30:37.355
- North korea.
- Right.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.785
This fish could live for...

30:40.820 --> 30:44.142
oh, my god, three or four years.

30:44.177 --> 30:46.817
Four and a half or five.

30:46.852 --> 30:50.841
Or six.
Or six, six, that's it.

30:50.876 --> 30:52.785
- Six years.
- I'd like to read your book.

30:52.820 --> 30:55.353
What did you say your name was?

30:55.388 --> 30:59.463
Tilburn.
Larry...

30:59.498 --> 31:03.414
- T, I, L, B, U, R, N?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!

31:06.007 --> 31:08.510
Truth is,

31:08.545 --> 31:09.909
it's not the same fish.

31:09.944 --> 31:11.793
- Yes, it is. Sure it is.
- Let it go.

31:12.892 --> 31:15.147
I've replaced it every year.

31:15.182 --> 31:17.510
Julie's dad gave it to her
before he died.

31:17.545 --> 31:20.938
I don't have the heart to tell her the
truth. It's all that she has left of him.

31:20.973 --> 31:23.218
So, Mr. Franklin, if you wanna
call that little girl

31:23.253 --> 31:25.665
and tell her that the fish
that she's been talking to

31:25.700 --> 31:29.231
and praying to for the last
six years is dead then,

31:29.266 --> 31:31.439
you know what, go ahead!
I'll dial it for you.

31:31.474 --> 31:33.255
Okay, okay. I didn't know.

31:34.344 --> 31:36.343
She can bring the fish
to the science fair.

31:36.378 --> 31:39.454
If you like, I'll even swing by your
house later and pick up the aquarium.

31:40.213 --> 31:43.377
- Thank you.
- But I can't give her an award.

31:43.412 --> 31:46.137
Mr. Franklin, she doesn't need an award.

31:46.172 --> 31:49.807
She just needs to make it through
middle school without falling apart.

31:49.842 --> 31:51.771
Thank you, sir.

31:51.806 --> 31:53.396
Thank you, sir.

31:55.768 --> 31:57.477
You really are the worst liar
in the whole world.

31:57.512 --> 31:59.616
I tried to tell you that.

32:00.766 --> 32:02.273
An honest man.

32:03.025 --> 32:04.524
Who'd have thunk it?

32:05.409 --> 32:07.399
Come on, Larry.

32:07.434 --> 32:08.858
I'll take you home.

32:34.930 --> 32:36.942
Just be a minute.
I have to pick up my check.

32:36.977 --> 32:38.521
It's a nice place.

32:38.556 --> 32:41.891
It's a toilet. - Uh, wouldn't
exactly call it a toilet.

32:42.050 --> 32:44.680
- Um, have a seat.
- Where?

32:46.448 --> 32:48.621
Well, there's a lot of chairs.
Take your pick.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.925
How about that one?

33:00.300 --> 33:01.915
Or that one?

33:01.950 --> 33:05.172
Natalie, so I've been thinking.

33:05.746 --> 33:10.439
Uh, if you, if you really hate it here.

33:10.474 --> 33:14.681
I mean, if you're really not happy,

33:14.716 --> 33:18.765
if you really hate it here...

33:19.306 --> 33:22.269
I am looking for a new assistant.

33:23.519 --> 33:25.444
Thank you, Adrian.
I appreciate that.

33:25.479 --> 33:27.287
But I'm not the "girl friday" type.

33:27.322 --> 33:30.861
Yeah, I understand.
I couldn't work for me, either.

33:31.282 --> 33:33.293
To tell you the truth,

33:33.328 --> 33:37.419
I don't know how, how Sharona
lasted as long as she did.

33:46.168 --> 33:49.422
Hey, Clem, I need to pick
up my paycheck. - Yeah, right here.

33:50.224 --> 33:52.627
Actually, I was just
about to call you.

33:52.662 --> 33:55.016
Carly just walked.
I need you to fill in tonight.

33:55.051 --> 33:57.529
Yeah, I can't help you. There's
a science fair at my kid's school.

33:57.564 --> 34:00.183
Well, I got a kid, too, but I'm here.

34:00.218 --> 34:03.107
- Your kid's in jail, Clem.
- You think that's funny, huh?

34:03.142 --> 34:06.515
You know, Teeger, I'm getting
pretty tired of your attitude.

34:06.550 --> 34:10.143
All right, the last time I asked you to
help me out here, you bailed on me.

34:10.563 --> 34:13.790
Are you talking about yesterday?
Sorry I couldn't be here, Clem.

34:13.824 --> 34:16.219
I was watching the cops
carry a body out of my house.

34:16.255 --> 34:17.891
Yeah. I heard about that.

34:17.927 --> 34:21.385
Well, I guess you did
what you had to do. - Yeah.

34:21.420 --> 34:23.710
And that's exactly
what I'm doing right now.

34:23.745 --> 34:25.788
I got a business to run, Teeger.

34:25.822 --> 34:29.281
So you wanna see more
of these or not?

34:32.963 --> 34:35.706
- Fine. I'll be here.
- Good.

34:37.822 --> 34:39.246
Where are you?

34:42.444 --> 34:46.103
Ready? - Natalie.
I know what they're after.

34:46.138 --> 34:47.701
- You do?
- Where's Julie?

34:47.735 --> 34:49.444
Where, where's Julie?

34:51.433 --> 34:53.150
This is my fire extinguisher.

34:53.186 --> 34:57.395
I invented it myself using an oxygen tank,
some compressed air,

34:57.430 --> 34:59.250
and an ordinary garden hose.

34:59.795 --> 35:01.876
- Where is she?
- I don't know. I don't know.

35:01.911 --> 35:05.118
- Oh, Stacy. Have you seen Julie?
- I think she's over there.

35:08.537 --> 35:09.961
Captain, thank you for coming.

35:09.996 --> 35:11.877
Okay, fill me in.

35:11.912 --> 35:14.557
I know what they've been after.
Look.

35:16.314 --> 35:19.827
- The moonrock?
- It's the most valuable rock in the world.

35:19.862 --> 35:21.860
It's more valuable than any diamond.

35:21.895 --> 35:25.700
A rock half this size
was sold in Japan for $2 million.

35:25.735 --> 35:29.324
Okay. - Well, I knew that I had seen
that rock before somewhere.

35:29.359 --> 35:31.686
It was in Julie Teeger's aquarium.

35:33.775 --> 35:36.475
It was right in front of us the whole time.
Here's what happened.

35:36.510 --> 35:40.812
There's a tour guide at the museum
named Peck. Lyle Peck.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.440
Last weekend, he stole the moonrock.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.916
It was probably Sunday night
after they closed.

35:47.867 --> 35:51.873
He waited until the guards were
distracted or between shifts.

35:51.908 --> 35:53.753
Peck has worked there for years.

35:53.788 --> 35:55.200
He's practically a fixture,

35:55.235 --> 35:57.795
so he definitely knew the routine.

35:57.830 --> 35:59.771
Why didn't the museum report it?

35:59.806 --> 36:03.048
The museum never missed it.
They didn't know it was stolen.

36:03.083 --> 36:04.495
They still don't.

36:04.530 --> 36:07.764
Peck replaced it with an exact duplicate.

36:08.445 --> 36:10.366
Wait, you mean this
is just a regular rock?

36:10.895 --> 36:14.070
Son of a bitch, I stood in line for half
an hour just to touch this stupid thing.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.438
Right. But Peck had a problem.

36:16.473 --> 36:19.569
He still had to get the moonrock
out of the building.

36:19.604 --> 36:22.293
They were searching everybody.
Even the employees.

36:24.118 --> 36:28.161
So since there was no way
for him to get it through security,

36:28.196 --> 36:30.461
he had to improvise.

36:31.249 --> 36:34.157
He hid the rock in the gift shop.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.684
Inside one of those aquarium kits.

36:39.295 --> 36:42.100
Then he marked the box.

36:42.135 --> 36:44.594
He probably planned to
have his accomplice, Brian Lemmon,

36:44.629 --> 36:46.681
pick it up the next morning.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.463
But the girl got there first.

36:49.498 --> 36:54.326
Exactly, Julie Teeger bought it
that morning and took it home.

36:57.948 --> 37:01.918
The next day Peck tried to steal it,
posing as a meter reader.

37:01.953 --> 37:04.867
When that didn't work,
Brian Lemmon broke in.

37:04.902 --> 37:08.841
But he didn't count on Natalie waking up
or that pair of scissors.

37:09.995 --> 37:13.666
- What?
- You're back.

37:15.418 --> 37:18.000
- Natalie.
- This is Mr. Henry.

37:18.035 --> 37:20.811
- We gotta grab that rock.
- Mr. Henry is a marble fish.

37:20.846 --> 37:24.278
And most marble fish
only live for about a year.

37:24.313 --> 37:28.513
But Mr. Henry is six years old,
and he's still as frisky as ever.

37:28.548 --> 37:31.880
And that is thanks to my special diet

37:31.915 --> 37:36.826
of ground-up vitamins,
rice crispies, and cucumbers.

38:00.384 --> 38:02.663
Fire! It's on fire!

38:06.220 --> 38:07.927
All right, everybody stay calm.

38:08.193 --> 38:09.993
No running.
Stay calm.

38:10.776 --> 38:13.004
Here use this.
It's a fire extinguisher.

38:13.388 --> 38:15.090
Thanks, kid.

38:18.226 --> 38:20.447
- What's in this?
- Turpentine.

38:39.255 --> 38:41.227
He stole my fish!

38:41.262 --> 38:44.313
- Hey!
- Peck!

39:56.701 --> 39:58.316
Oh, god.

40:00.249 --> 40:01.901
I got him.

40:05.811 --> 40:08.725
Peck! Don't move.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.254
On your face.

40:20.197 --> 40:21.937
Look out, I got a fish here!

40:21.972 --> 40:24.027
Coming through, flapping around!

40:24.062 --> 40:25.820
Flapping fish here!

40:27.814 --> 40:29.754
Oh, Monk! Monk.

40:32.657 --> 40:34.789
- Get him.
- Get him. Hurry, hurry.

40:34.824 --> 40:37.081
Look out! Coming through.

40:37.116 --> 40:38.290
Coming through.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.931
You saved him.

41:06.683 --> 41:08.823
Pretty crazy day, huh?

41:08.858 --> 41:10.563
Think you'll be able to sleep?

41:10.598 --> 41:13.576
Yeah, I think so.
How's Mr. Henry?

41:13.611 --> 41:16.999
Oh, he's fine.
He's a very brave fish.

41:18.242 --> 41:20.406
Mr. Monk saved his life.

41:20.441 --> 41:23.788
You know that moonrock is
worth over two million bucks?

41:23.823 --> 41:28.422
But when Mr. Henry was in trouble,
Mr. Monk forgot all about that moonrock.

41:28.963 --> 41:31.816
All he cared about was
saving Mr. Henry.

41:32.670 --> 41:34.868
I could only think of
one other man in the whole

41:34.869 --> 41:36.977
world who would have
done something like that.

41:37.654 --> 41:41.088
- Daddy?
- Daddy.

41:44.445 --> 41:46.811
- I love you, angel.
- Love you, too.

41:47.411 --> 41:49.955
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

41:49.990 --> 41:52.241
Oh, sleep well.

42:12.667 --> 42:14.409
Mr. Monk, it's Natalie Teeger.

42:14.444 --> 42:17.709
Yeah, I was calling to see
if you still needed the assistant.

42:18.679 --> 42:20.500
No, I can't come tonight.

42:21.307 --> 42:23.309
Because I can't leave my daughter.

42:24.147 --> 42:26.212
Okay, okay, okay, just relax.

42:26.899 --> 42:29.075
How big is the spider?

42:30.305 --> 42:36.160
