WEBVTT

00:49.917 --> 00:52.557
I'm sorry, Doreen.

00:53.754 --> 00:59.261
We fought through
seven outbreaks together

00:59.826 --> 01:03.273
<i>and I always thought
I was the one leading you.</i>

01:04.531 --> 01:07.512
<i>It turns out
you were the one pushing me.</i>

01:15.242 --> 01:17.085
Have you located Balleseros?

01:17.277 --> 01:19.621
<i>No. Not yet.</i>

01:21.715 --> 01:23.956
<i>Doreen's murder was no coincidence.</i>

01:25.886 --> 01:29.390
I'm not sure I follow.
Oh, you follow just fine.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.627
But let me spell it out for you
anyway.

01:31.858 --> 01:35.396
<i>Whatever Balleseros is up to
has everything to do with this virus.</i>

01:35.596 --> 01:39.442
Wanna pretend you don't know that,
that's fine. But I want him found.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.778
Who's this?
Dr. Rae Van Eigem.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.679
I found her on Level B
after Level R was sealed off.

02:20.273 --> 02:24.346
She died before the coma could set in.
You found her on Level B?

02:25.445 --> 02:26.924
Why wasn't I notified?

02:27.414 --> 02:28.859
There wasn't time.

02:32.519 --> 02:35.363
I isolated her and tended to her needs
as best I could.

02:35.522 --> 02:38.526
This is Narvik-B.
She should be a vector, not a corpse.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.333
How did she die, Sarah?

02:44.097 --> 02:45.770
Morphine.

02:46.199 --> 02:47.303
Overdose.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.114
Who administered the dose?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.784
I did what I thought was right.

02:57.444 --> 02:59.981
So much for not killing
the infected, right, doc?

03:04.518 --> 03:08.056
I am going down to Level R
and I am bringing back Dr. Walker.

03:08.221 --> 03:09.996
You might wanna inform your boss.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.330
He's dealing
with an emergency situation.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.735
What situation could be
more pressing than this outbreak?

03:15.962 --> 03:18.033
He'll be back
when he's finished,

03:18.231 --> 03:21.405
and no one is going down
to Level R.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.979
No one in, no one out.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.980
That includes Dr. Walker.

03:28.241 --> 03:32.485
Are you gonna shoot me, Daniel?
Is that really your play here?

03:32.679 --> 03:35.683
You need to get back to your lab.
I don't work for you!

03:35.849 --> 03:38.489
You have any idea what this is?
What ifs doing?

03:38.685 --> 03:40.722
I'm aware, yes. People are sick.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.528
Not sick, they're dying.
Your brother is showing improvement.

03:44.725 --> 03:48.002
My brother barely has brain activity,
no thanks to Hatake.

03:48.195 --> 03:50.675
Dr. Hatake and I want
the same thing you do.

03:50.864 --> 03:54.243
That gun in your hand
is telling a different story, son.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.277
Will you two cut it out?

03:57.871 --> 04:00.681
Get back to work.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.282
Now.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.199
I'll take care of her.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.349
Peter.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.686
What are you doing here?

05:16.983 --> 05:18.621
I came to help you.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.761
Help me with what? You...

05:23.523 --> 05:24.593
You're not real.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.467
Feels pretty real.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.511
Go away.

05:43.009 --> 05:47.287
Still here. You must want me
to stay for a reason.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.319
Like what?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.060
Who is she?

06:19.679 --> 06:20.987
Hello?

07:16.303 --> 07:18.647
So, what now?
I'm going down to get Julia.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.545
Wait...
She wrote the book

07:20.707 --> 07:23.085
on viral splicing
and RNA binding proteins.

07:23.243 --> 07:27.419
We need her to fight this thing.
We don't know how sick she is.

07:27.580 --> 07:31.050
We don't know if she can work.
No, we don't. But Doreen is dead.

07:31.217 --> 07:34.096
Balleseros has gone missing,
we are back to square one.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.791
Jules is our best hope. Only hope.
How do we get down to Level R?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.962
Stairwells are sealed shut,
Daniel controls the elevator.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.129
I'll have to improvise.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.974
By the way, these are for you,
for your migraines.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.177
Gabapentin. Where did you...?

07:49.402 --> 07:52.246
Dr. Sulemani used them for OCD.
They should work.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.013
No more morphine.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.416
I need you sharp.
You and I are all we have left.

07:58.578 --> 08:01.491
If we don't have each other,
don't back each other up,

08:01.681 --> 08:03.592
we have nothing.
Absolutely.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.162
And thank you.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.124
<i>Cafeteria is now open.</i>

08:11.324 --> 08:13.930
<i>Cafeteria is now open.</i>

08:14.127 --> 08:15.538
<i>Cafeteria is now...</i>

08:37.650 --> 08:39.186
Damn it.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.161
Oh, my God.

08:48.795 --> 08:49.830
What is it?

08:50.030 --> 08:51.134
Your wound.

08:51.831 --> 08:55.574
Infection?
No, it's healing remarkably fast.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.144
Must have good genes.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.320
Must have.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.683
Are you all right?

09:12.419 --> 09:13.727
Why didn't you tell me?

09:14.587 --> 09:16.760
Tell you what?
That I was hallucinating.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.594
That Jaye wasn't real.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.237
Why did you let me believe
she was here?

09:21.428 --> 09:25.342
Do you enjoy watching people suffer?
I am a doctor first, like you.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.443
My job is to save people.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.738
By lying to them?
I didn't tell you

09:29.936 --> 09:31.916
because I didn't need to.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.709
You were disoriented

09:33.907 --> 09:36.945
and speaking to Jaye
seemed to be helping.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.357
I'm sorry.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.888
You're right.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.201
Help!

09:51.391 --> 09:52.802
Help!

09:54.761 --> 09:56.297
Not everyone can be saved.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.268
Dr. Walker?

10:02.635 --> 10:05.206
Julia? Julia.

10:13.079 --> 10:15.457
Been a long time
since I've made thermite.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.822
It was in high school,
senior prank.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.791
It didn't go very well.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.615
This was no quarantine.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.927
It was a "seal and forget."

10:52.952 --> 10:54.522
Dark in there.

10:54.754 --> 10:57.826
Can't see much.
They're probably huddled in the labs.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.095
We'll never find her like this.

11:00.693 --> 11:01.933
We have to go inside.

11:13.773 --> 11:17.050
I see something
at the end of the hall.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.036
Go!

11:49.309 --> 11:51.915
If there's an abrasion
or a out or anything...

11:52.145 --> 11:53.920
I'm fine.
We have to make sure.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.991
I had no idea
there'd be so many.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.219
I ought to have my head examined
for putting you at risk.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.422
I chose to go down there.
First Doreen, then Jules.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.031
I can't lose you too.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.830
Alan, what are we gonna do
about Julia?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.076
We have to go through those...

12:15.268 --> 12:18.613
Those monsters?
I was going to say "those patients."

12:18.838 --> 12:20.545
Desperately sick patients.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.778
If we wanna get to Jules,
we'll have to treat them first.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.182
What if we can't?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.759
Then they'll bury this base,

12:29.249 --> 12:30.785
with us in it.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.899
What are you doing?

12:45.131 --> 12:46.235
You passed out.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.375
Don't worry, Julia.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.550
We'll have you back on your feet
in no time.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.785
What are you doing to my eyes?
I can't see.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.993
What is that?

13:06.886 --> 13:09.492
I'm giving you a sedative.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.978
You should sleep.

13:30.243 --> 13:33.019
I don't wanna sleep.
Shh.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.158
You are going to be okay.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.843
<i>Access granted.</i>

14:52.558 --> 14:54.231
Oh! What the hell?

15:10.343 --> 15:12.846
Who are you?
I could ask you the same thing.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.219
I'm Anana.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.524
Anana?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.693
Where am I?

15:20.119 --> 15:22.224
You're in my home.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.871
Are these really necessary?
Don't know you from Adam.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.371
In that case,
maybe I should cuff you too.

15:32.732 --> 15:37.044
I'm Sergio. I assume I have you
to thank for punching me in the face?

15:37.737 --> 15:40.445
You kept trying to fight me.
How are you feeling?

15:40.640 --> 15:41.710
Like hell.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.479
Better than expected
for a guy left for dead on the ice.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.418
What is this green shit?
It's a seaweed pack.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.059
We're not exactly near
the Mayo Clinic,

15:50.249 --> 15:51.785
so relax.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.220
You're the law?
Only peace officer

15:54.387 --> 15:56.492
within 400 miles
of Tonrar settlement.

15:58.724 --> 16:01.102
Tonrar?
Means ghost.

16:01.561 --> 16:05.634
Sounds scarier than what it is.
We don't stay in one place very long.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.945
Drink this. It'll warm you up.
Lucky to have all your fingers...

16:14.240 --> 16:15.913
What'd you have to do that for? Huh?

16:16.108 --> 16:18.418
I was trying to be hospitable.
ll hurls.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.114
Good. Let that be our introduction.
Bullshit!

16:21.280 --> 16:23.487
What am I, a hostage?
Depends.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.924
This can be as dirty
as you want it to be.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.120
What do you want?

16:27.286 --> 16:31.462
I want what's in here. Tell me what
you know about Arctic Biosystems.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.102
I don't know anything.

16:33.292 --> 16:37.206
That's how you wanna play it?
Then maybe you are a hostage.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.666
This is ridiculous.

16:40.299 --> 16:44.509
If you wanna talk, great. If not, I can
always bring you back to the base

16:44.704 --> 16:48.117
and let whoever tried to kill you
finish what they started.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.179
Sarah.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.019
Come have a look at this.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.889
Tell me what you see.

17:04.523 --> 17:08.061
The virus is attacking the cell,
multiplying rapidly.

17:09.228 --> 17:10.366
Look again.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.509
Look more closely.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.173
Oh, my God.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.510
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.845
How could you?
We weren't looking for it.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.421
He's using the virus
as a delivery mechanism.

17:25.645 --> 17:29.422
The question is, what's the virus
bringing to the party?

17:30.349 --> 17:32.022
And Why?

17:34.487 --> 17:35.522
Son of a bitch.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.539
<i> Entomology.</i>

17:42.728 --> 17:46.175
<i>Attention. Code 121, Level...</i>

17:46.365 --> 17:49.403
Dr. Farragut.
What's in the virus?

17:49.602 --> 17:51.843
Nothing.
I saw it with my own eyes.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.949
What did you splice
into its genetic code?

17:54.106 --> 17:55.744
Don't know what you mean.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.787
I know you're using the virus
as a delivery mechanism.

17:58.945 --> 18:02.017
Now, what kind of gene therapy
are you messing with?

18:04.016 --> 18:06.792
You used my brother as a lab rat.

18:07.019 --> 18:10.899
You played with his life, with Julia's,
with those poor people on Level R.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.901
You put this place here
so you wouldn't be regulated,

18:14.060 --> 18:16.472
so you could play God
with people's lives!

18:16.629 --> 18:18.199
Look where it's gotten you!

18:18.397 --> 18:21.037
Tell me the truth.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.445
Yes.

18:25.905 --> 18:29.250
Narvik is a delivery system.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.820
But there is no conspiracy,
Dr. Farragut.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.650
That, I'm afraid, is in your head.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.451
As far as your brother...

18:38.417 --> 18:40.055
he was no lab rat.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.287
What then?

18:41.487 --> 18:42.591
What is all this?

18:43.422 --> 18:46.733
A way to treat
what was once untreatable.

18:48.728 --> 18:49.832
Cancer?

18:50.062 --> 18:51.939
All five classifications.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.838
Think of it.

18:54.500 --> 18:58.277
A cure for one of the deadliest
diseases of our time.

18:58.471 --> 19:02.351
Instead of causing harm,
the virus delivers a cure.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.445
It's brilliant.
Unfortunately,

19:05.645 --> 19:08.319
we haven't perfected it yet.

19:08.514 --> 19:09.754
It wasn't the virus.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.485
What's not?

19:12.184 --> 19:13.788
The virus made Peter sick,

19:13.953 --> 19:15.364
but it didn't change him.

19:15.521 --> 19:18.365
It was the gene therapy
inside the virus.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.834
What did you put into
the Narvik-B strain that changed him?

19:22.028 --> 19:23.871
Nothing.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.371
We hadn't introduced
the gene therapy.

19:26.999 --> 19:31.311
There is something
inside this virus.

19:32.204 --> 19:34.309
And I will find it.

19:40.446 --> 19:43.859
I need you to tell me
what's really going on here.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.723
It doesn't concern you.

19:45.951 --> 19:50.195
Your safety and the safety of
this base is my only concern.

19:50.389 --> 19:53.666
I can't protect you
if I'm in the dark.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.571
A lot has happened
while you were away.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.675
Balleseros found Dr. Hvit.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.905
What? How did he...?
It's not a problem. I took care of him.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.674
Took care of him? How?

20:08.874 --> 20:13.345
Introduced him to the business end of
an ice ax. Left him out on the ice.

20:13.979 --> 20:15.549
What have you done?

20:16.015 --> 20:19.861
You said yourself he was
a threat. I eliminated him.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.093
You fool!

20:22.321 --> 20:23.356
Don't you see?

20:25.891 --> 20:29.703
When he fails to check in,
they will come.

20:53.719 --> 20:56.063
You need to eat.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.895
Your body is trying to heal.
Like you care.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.903
Heh, you're no good to me dead.
Fine. I just wanna know why I'm here.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.133
So we're doing this dance again?

21:05.364 --> 21:06.968
I told you why you're here.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.769
Arctic Biosystems.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.744
I already told you,
I don't know anything.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.208
You knew enough that someone
tried to leave you for dead.

21:15.374 --> 21:16.785
That was a personal thing.

21:16.942 --> 21:20.981
Had nothing to do with the base.
What about the research they do?

21:21.213 --> 21:24.092
Tell me about the children.
What children?

21:24.283 --> 21:26.763
What are you talking about?

21:27.253 --> 21:29.460
We can try this again later.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.898
Gonna be the same
whenever you try.

21:32.057 --> 21:34.731
That depends on
how hungry you get.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.700
They are so cute at that age.

22:13.365 --> 22:15.606
What is this place?

22:16.168 --> 22:18.546
Why did you bring me here?

22:19.605 --> 22:22.848
Hey, this is your dance party.
I'm just along for the ride.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.521
Maybe you should ask her.

22:29.548 --> 22:31.357
About what?

22:32.685 --> 22:35.894
Maybe she's trying to get you
to remember something.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.030
Something you've forgotten.

22:40.025 --> 22:43.199
How am I supposed to remember
something I've forgotten?

22:43.395 --> 22:45.568
Nothing's ever really forgotten.

22:45.798 --> 22:48.301
Not if you don't want it to be.

22:50.469 --> 22:52.574
Go ahead, ask her.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.496
Hi.

23:18.497 --> 23:19.840
I'm Julia.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.773
That's my name too.

23:31.176 --> 23:34.851
What is this place, Julia?
This is my house.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.583
You mean you live here?

23:37.783 --> 23:40.127
Only in the summer.

23:40.352 --> 23:42.059
I come here with my mommy.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.868
I used to spend the summer
with my mommy too.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.799
You did?
Mm.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.907
In a place called Montana.
Have you ever heard of it?

23:53.966 --> 23:57.971
Of course I have, silly. Where
do you think we are right now?

24:04.643 --> 24:07.453
Yes. This is where I grew up.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.726
This is Montana,
where I lived with my mother.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.996
I'm home.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.991
Now we wait.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.432
Something like that.

24:58.364 --> 25:00.105
What the hell?

25:08.207 --> 25:09.515
Oh!

25:26.458 --> 25:28.301
Have you ever...?

25:31.063 --> 25:32.633
What's it doing?

25:32.831 --> 25:35.072
Reacting to the cold.

25:39.638 --> 25:43.085
Extreme low temperatures.
Slowing down the effects of the virus.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.746
This might work on humans.
We need to get Peter on ice.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.060
Lift his head. All right.

26:01.894 --> 26:05.432
What was that thing?
Whatever it was, cold slowed it down.

26:06.331 --> 26:10.746
I've never seen anything like that.
No one has seen anything like that.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.718
It's working,
but we have to get him colder.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.550
There was a lab.

26:20.746 --> 26:23.727
Down on Level G,
doing some kind of cryo work.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.520
Who?
Um, Dr. Victor Adrian.

26:25.684 --> 26:28.688
You stay here. Get him colder
and get him prepped to move.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.264
Okay.

26:53.579 --> 26:55.217
Key.
Mm.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.886
Key.

27:00.085 --> 27:01.325
Don't.

27:01.887 --> 27:03.662
Understand?
Mm-hm.

27:06.658 --> 27:08.160
Don't!

27:09.461 --> 27:11.065
Do you understand?

27:13.665 --> 27:16.339
Easy!
You wanna know why you're here?

27:16.768 --> 27:17.803
Take a look.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.580
What am I looking at?
A bunch of kids?

27:20.772 --> 27:23.309
Missing kids,
31 over the past two decades,

27:23.475 --> 27:26.081
all within 200 miles
of Arctic Biosystems

27:26.278 --> 27:28.417
and your precious Dr. Hatake.

27:28.614 --> 27:29.649
I don't understand.

27:29.848 --> 27:32.454
Someone's been stealing
our children.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.927
You have no idea
who you're protecting.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.630
Or maybe you do. Hm?

27:38.090 --> 27:39.330
You tell me.

27:42.027 --> 27:45.531
You try anything again,
I will shoot you.

27:50.135 --> 27:51.773
<i>That's funny.</i>

27:54.640 --> 27:56.176
<i>We'll sneak up on her slow.</i>

27:56.375 --> 27:58.878
<i>I'll be right behind you.
Don't be afraid.</i>

28:00.479 --> 28:01.617
Victor Adrian?

28:04.616 --> 28:07.688
I'm Alan Farragut of the CDC.
Piss off.

28:07.886 --> 28:09.729
<i>Okay. Forward then.</i>
Hey.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.568
I was watching that.
I need your help.

28:13.792 --> 28:17.501
I've been stuck here
for a week like a caged animal.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.040
What do you expect,
a welcome mat?

28:20.232 --> 28:23.406
I know the situation
has been less than ideal.

28:23.569 --> 28:26.914
Ha, ha! Now, that is
the understatement of the year.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.352
What do I get out of it?

28:31.543 --> 28:34.023
Excuse me?
Quid pro quo.

28:34.179 --> 28:37.183
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine.

28:37.349 --> 28:40.228
We understand each other?
What is it you want?

28:40.419 --> 28:44.697
Call off the guards. I haven't taken a
shit without a chaperone for six days.

28:44.890 --> 28:50.203
Second, I want to be first in line out of
this hellhole when the cavalry arrive.

28:50.395 --> 28:54.172
All right. You help me solve this,
and you will be first in line.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.277
I guarantee it.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.040
There.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.740
Dr. Alan Farragut.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.048
How may I be of assistance?

29:07.446 --> 29:10.393
You work with cooling systems?
Mm-hm.

29:10.549 --> 29:11.550
Cryotherapy?

29:11.717 --> 29:14.061
VFC Immersion.
Latest and greatest.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.233
Does it work?

29:17.256 --> 29:21.432
Why don't you say hello
to some of my friends?

29:57.896 --> 29:59.432
Hey.
Ha, ha.

30:23.188 --> 30:24.496
Stop right there!

30:25.524 --> 30:26.969
You both work for Hatake.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.002
Is that it?
Let him go.

30:29.194 --> 30:32.801
He tried to kill me back at the base.
What? When?

30:32.998 --> 30:35.706
You want information about
Hatake? Here's your man.

30:36.134 --> 30:38.205
Go ahead. Ask him.

30:38.437 --> 30:41.111
Are you out of your mind?
That's my brother!

30:41.306 --> 30:42.717
Daniel is your brother?

30:43.775 --> 30:45.015
Who's Daniel?

30:45.510 --> 30:46.853
That's my brother, Tulok!

31:01.126 --> 31:03.504
You wanna tell me
why you attacked my brother?

31:03.662 --> 31:07.132
I was just trying to escape.

31:12.838 --> 31:14.875
This is a picture
of me and my brothers.

31:15.574 --> 31:16.814
Twins.

31:17.843 --> 31:19.584
You met Tulok outside.

31:19.811 --> 31:21.722
This is Miksa.

31:22.214 --> 31:26.526
He disappeared when we were kids.
He was only 4 years old.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.259
Where's Miksa now?

31:29.421 --> 31:31.697
You tell me, you son of a bitch.

31:31.857 --> 31:35.669
Have you seen him?
I need to go back to the base.

31:36.194 --> 31:39.573
We need to go back to the base.

31:49.508 --> 31:53.285
I didn't know we'd be trying this out
on an actual person,

31:53.445 --> 31:56.915
let alone someone
as bad off <i>as</i> he is.

31:58.016 --> 31:59.586
I can't promise anything.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.594
Understood.

32:04.122 --> 32:06.966
VFC Immersion hypothermia.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.529
Human trials...

32:09.961 --> 32:11.304
take one.

32:12.063 --> 32:15.203
How do you slop the body's
defense mechanisms against cold?

32:15.367 --> 32:19.577
It is all in how we cool the body down.
The solution is taken into his lungs,

32:19.738 --> 32:22.082
while it simultaneously
soaks into the skin

32:22.240 --> 32:25.449
and envelops the entire body,
inside and on the out.

32:25.644 --> 32:26.987
So how does he breathe?

32:27.579 --> 32:28.990
He doesn't breathe.

32:30.148 --> 32:32.628
Humans don't breathe
for the first nine months.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.765
It's a matter
of keeping him oxygenated.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.996
Either way,
we still have a deal, right?

32:39.224 --> 32:41.295
No matter how this goes.

32:44.262 --> 32:46.606
Just give me a
little more time, Peter.

32:47.098 --> 32:48.133
Let's do this.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.967
Julia, come on. Time to eat.

33:26.037 --> 33:28.950
Why are you here?
You're the one that made her sick.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.620
This is all your fault.
My fault?

33:32.711 --> 33:35.351
Don't blame me.
We're all trapped here because of her.

33:35.547 --> 33:36.617
That's not fair.

33:36.781 --> 33:38.381
Who said anything about fair?

33:38.517 --> 33:41.020
This is all in your head.
Why are we even here?

33:41.186 --> 33:42.290
I don't know.

33:43.154 --> 33:46.465
Pass the cranberry sauce.
Please.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.065
Thank you.

33:49.294 --> 33:51.797
It's all about you.
It's always been about you.

33:51.997 --> 33:55.137
He's right, you know. He's right.
You got us into this mess.

33:55.333 --> 33:59.577
I'm not... I mean, I didn't... I just...
I didn't mean to get... Oh, come on.

34:01.206 --> 34:05.018
I just want answers.
You don't know the right questions.

34:06.578 --> 34:07.921
Why you, Julia?

34:08.146 --> 34:10.056
Why this virus?

34:10.248 --> 34:11.989
- Why now?
- I'm starved.

34:12.183 --> 34:14.163
Can we do this while we eat?

34:15.587 --> 34:18.500
You have all the answers.
You just don't know it.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.862
I'm trying to remember,
but I can't.

34:21.059 --> 34:24.438
Just figure it out already.
Figure it out so we can eat.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.938
Anyone like sweet potatoes?

34:31.402 --> 34:34.009
Maybe the question
isn't why we're here

34:34.205 --> 34:37.208
as much as why we're here.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.688
This place,
the cabin where you grew up.

34:40.879 --> 34:44.884
Maybe this would be easier
if we all ate something.

34:47.953 --> 34:50.263
Mm.
Will you carve, Jules?

35:04.769 --> 35:06.771
Mmm!

35:11.743 --> 35:14.314
Wait. This isn't
supposed to be happening.

35:15.981 --> 35:17.824
This is not happening!

35:27.158 --> 35:28.933
Are you sure about this?

35:29.127 --> 35:30.333
He'll adapt.

35:41.106 --> 35:42.676
He'll settle. it's normal.

35:42.907 --> 35:44.443
Normal for what?
It's okay.

35:44.609 --> 35:47.590
The monkeys did the exact
same thing. The rats too.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.463
This is killing him.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.368
Alan.

36:04.963 --> 36:05.998
Alan!

36:08.366 --> 36:10.209
He's drowning.
No. No.

36:10.435 --> 36:12.676
If there's any chance
we could save him...

36:12.837 --> 36:14.976
His core temperature's dropping.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.453
It's 95.

36:18.943 --> 36:20.047
Eighty-five.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.020
Seventy-five.

36:22.781 --> 36:23.851
Sixty-five.

36:25.316 --> 36:27.455
Fifty-five degrees.

36:28.319 --> 36:30.026
Alan.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.233
Can he see us?

36:41.399 --> 36:42.844
No.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.071
I don't think so.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.675
But it's something.

36:48.973 --> 36:50.850
Progress.

37:01.753 --> 37:05.667
The CDC seems to have had
a breakthrough.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.859
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.105
Please forgive me, Father...
It's my fault.

37:14.265 --> 37:17.371
I didn't prepare you well enough.

37:18.269 --> 37:19.373
I made a mistake.

37:19.571 --> 37:24.714
There are no mistakes,
only opportunities wasted.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.182
It won't happen again.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.916
Good.

37:31.449 --> 37:34.623
We don't have much time
to prepare.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.124
What do you want me to do?

37:40.458 --> 37:42.233
First...

37:43.628 --> 37:46.302
show me Major Balleseros' body.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.586
It's amazing.

38:04.783 --> 38:09.095
Brain activity isn't 100 percent,
but it's a start.

38:12.590 --> 38:14.968
Alan, are you okay?

39:16.487 --> 39:18.125
This is where I left him.

39:18.323 --> 39:20.200
Right here.

39:21.326 --> 39:24.864
I took his jacket and boots.
He couldn't have gone far.

39:36.341 --> 39:37.752
He's been taken.

39:38.877 --> 39:39.912
I'll go find him.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.192
No.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.157
We'll deal with this later.

39:46.684 --> 39:47.719
They're here.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.952
Are you okay?

40:11.109 --> 40:12.679
Yeah.

40:18.383 --> 40:21.557
<i>Warning, incoming flight.</i>

40:21.886 --> 40:24.059
<i>Warning, incoming flight.</i>

40:24.255 --> 40:27.429
Thank God. The cavalry's here.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.302
How?

40:30.528 --> 40:32.132
I never got the call out.

40:32.363 --> 40:35.367
<i>Warning, incoming flight.</i>

41:26.951 --> 41:29.329
