it's an advanced class.

It's great, you studied hard,
and it paid off.

00:06.423 --> 00:07.879
Thanks, Dad, but I mean,

00:08.008 --> 00:10.044
normal physics
in this school
is hard enough.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.964
Maybe I don't want
to be accelerated.

put myself under
too much pressure.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.055
Well, pressure
can be good for you.

00:18.185 --> 00:21.348
I mean, my mother
used to say that pressure
can make diamonds.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.391
I mean, don't you want
to be a diamond?

00:23.524 --> 00:25.264
Well, can't I just be,
like, a sapphire

to hang outwith her friends?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.689
If you don't have time
to take advantage
of opportunities like this,

00:29.821 --> 00:33.188
then maybe we should
revisit the job thing.
Dad, don't even...

Okay, you know what?
That's fine.
I'll make it work.

the dogs in here?

They're biomimetic.

what breed they are,
it's unsanitary.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.359
It means artificial, Carter.
They're robots.

Oh, that biomimetic.

So, what, the DOD.

01:15.951 --> 01:18.567

doing here, anyway?

giving me one of her
logic diamonds.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.615
They're strictly regulated,
but being science director
does have its privileges.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.834
I just need
a law enforcement signature to
take it out of the building.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.123
All right.
Big experiment,
I'm assuming.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.417
Something
hopefully disfiguring.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.088
Actually, it'sjust
a wedding gift for Allie.

Guess the field's
wide open this year.

10:14.906 --> 10:17.818

There are no earthquakes
in Eureka.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.569

10:22.705 --> 10:25.572
Well, if you want
a second opinion,
you can always ask Dr. Hood.

He's retired,
but he used to be
the top dog in seismology,

10:28.878 --> 10:31.961

pretty much anything dirty
and he was in it.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.376
All right, thanks.
Nice to meet you.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.592

That wild man.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.849
Did he tell you about
the time we were running
those Columbian drugs?

10:41.975 --> 10:42.964
Uh, no.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.136
Yeah.

10:44.269 --> 10:48.137
Columbia med school
wanted to make
mineral-based vaccines.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.013
So Doug and l trekked
all over Alaska

10:50.150 --> 10:52.641
gathering eriochalcite
for those yahoos.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.567
Yeah, crazy times.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.523
So what can I do you for?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.775
Well, l was at a farm
near the lake,

11:01.911 --> 11:06.405
and there was an earthquake,
but nobody felt it but me.
Is that possible?

11:06.541 --> 11:08.497
Depends, how drunk were you?

11:09.377 --> 11:12.835
(LAUGHING) I'm sorry, man.
It's really not very likely.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.205
Yeah, because there aren't
any earthquakes in Eureka.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.081
This place is rock solid.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.334
I'm having trouble
finding someone
who believes me.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.210
I can relate.

11:21.347 --> 11:25.135
I spent the last year
of my career being
the guy no one believes.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.809
Anyway, where are we talking?

11:28.980 --> 11:29.969
Um...

11:34.861 --> 11:36.772
Round here.
All right.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.650
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

11:41.659 --> 11:44.526
Nope. Sorry.
Nothing going on down there.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.823
Dead as Toledo
on a Saturday night.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.871
The next time
I feel the ground shake

11:49.000 --> 11:52.993
and see
the northern lights inside,
I'll just leave the bar.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.215
Never mind.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.708
I got to get back to the case
of the dead fake dog anyway.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.468
Never mind.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.809
Northern lights, huh?

12:12.982 --> 12:15.815
Fifi's owner still
won't release the remains.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.653
She's afraid
we're going to steal
her doggie-building secrets.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.863
Well, that case
gets better and better.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.858
She still thinks Dr. Young
sabotaged her entry.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.906
So you think you wanna
talk to Dr. Young?

12:28.039 --> 12:30.200
No.
You wanna ask around?

12:30.333 --> 12:32.540
See if anybody else's
dogs malfunctioned?

12:32.669 --> 12:35.251
No, because this is stupid.
There isn't a crime.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.338
Those people waste
thousands of dollars...
Millions.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.967
Millions of dollars
making something

12:40.093 --> 12:42.926
they're giving away for free
in every pound in America.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.386
People need hobbies, Carter.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.722
| used to collect handcuffs.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.556
And meanwhile,
there was an earthquake

12:49.686 --> 12:52.553
which no one felt but me,
which is impossible.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.772
Because there are
no earthquakes in Eureka.

12:55.900 --> 12:56.810
(RUMBLING)

12:56.943 --> 12:57.898
(ALARM BLARING)

12:59.237 --> 13:00.522

13:03.533 --> 13:05.740

13:15.920 --> 13:17.296
WOMAN: What is it?

13:26.848 --> 13:27.928
Dr. Hood?

13:28.057 --> 13:30.890
Sheriff! You were right!

13:31.019 --> 13:34.637
There's something
brewing down there
and she's fixing to blow!

13:36.441 --> 13:37.430
(EXCLAIMS)

13:38.234 --> 13:39.394
Yeah.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.022
It's just a hole. Just a hole.
Stay to the left.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.321
Carter!

13:46.451 --> 13:50.194
Now, I already spoke to him.
He understands.
He is really sorry.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.413
Sorry? He could've
killed somebody.
Dr. Hood!

13:53.541 --> 13:55.873
Haven't we talked
about your using the tunneler?

13:56.002 --> 13:59.494
Well, talk to him.
He's the one that told me
about the triboluminescence.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.246
The, the...
The colored lights,
rocks under seismic stress

14:02.383 --> 14:04.840
can sometimes release visible
electromagnetic energy.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.425
So I dove down. You ready?

14:06.554 --> 14:08.636
All my readings indicate
there's a pressurized

14:08.765 --> 14:11.677
komatiite melt
under this town. Somewhere.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.801
Wait. Halt, halt. Stop!
There's something melting
under the town?

14:14.937 --> 14:15.972
Like what, like a volcano?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.892
Not like a volcano,
and it could erupt
at any time,

14:19.025 --> 14:20.731
and it's not linked
to any known fault system.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.851
That's why your quake
was so localized.

14:22.987 --> 14:26.821
A pocket of magma
developed spontaneously?
That's impossible.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.235
Did impossible
cover my friend with mucus?

14:30.036 --> 14:31.151
He's got a point.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.403
Okay. I'll have the geo lab
look into it.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.791
You stay above ground.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.709
So what, should we
start talking evacuation?

14:40.838 --> 14:42.578
Maybe hospitalization.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.253
(SCOFFS) Carter, there
is no magma chamber.
Dr. Hood is unstable.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.593
Not so much.
Seems like a smart guy.

14:48.721 --> 14:52.088
Look, five years ago,
Hood predicted a 9.6
on the Reelfoot Fault.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.681
We evacuated Memphis.

14:53.810 --> 14:54.890
Well, was there
an earthquake in Memphis?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.975
No. Hood cracked
under the pressure.

14:57.105 --> 15:01.644
He left right after that,
because he kept seeing things
that just weren't there.

15:02.026 --> 15:05.063
Carter, please,
I need you to keep
your eye on him.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.107
Don't let him
do any more damage.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.447
MAN 1: That's about
right, now.
HOOD: Okay.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.317
I'll see you later.
Do you want this back?

15:12.453 --> 15:14.785
Yeah, thanks,
appreciate it. Bye.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.825
HENRY: Acoustic physics
is a challenging class, Zoe.

15:16.958 --> 15:21.247
So, don't beat
yourself up about it.
It's very complicated stuff.

15:21.879 --> 15:25.588
Let's go back
to the beginning.
There's two main sections.

15:26.843 --> 15:27.923
CARTER: What are
you guys doing?

15:28.052 --> 15:29.633
Rayl wave dynamics.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.008
(SCREAMING)

15:38.271 --> 15:41.354
Um... Careful, Jack.
It's an acoustic
pressure wave.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.394
She's trying to figure out
the frequency to melt
copper ore.

15:44.735 --> 15:48.398
Wow! So you can really
melt metal with sound.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.271
Yeah, I don't even
understand it well enough

15:50.408 --> 15:52.945
to explain
why I don't understand it.
Do you want coffee?

15:53.077 --> 15:57.821
No, thanks.
I got something
I really don't want to do.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.243
I can relate.
Yeah. As can I.

16:01.752 --> 16:06.212
What are you avoiding?
Just some troubling errand
I can no longer ignore.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.379
Ah.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.543
See you later.
Yeah.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.042
Zoe, could you clear
table number five, please?

16:11.179 --> 16:13.261
Why not?
I'm gonna fail
this class anyway.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.596
But that's how
diamonds are made, right?

16:15.725 --> 16:17.306
Well, not unless you crack
under the pressure.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.595
(WHIRRING)

16:18.728 --> 16:19.968
Whoa! Whoa!

16:21.230 --> 16:22.640
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

16:23.274 --> 16:25.185
Hey! You are going
to have to clean that!

16:25.318 --> 16:27.525
Hey! What are you doing,
Dr. Hood?

16:27.653 --> 16:29.769
l'm dropping
a shear wave probe!

16:29.906 --> 16:31.146
You want a turn? It's a blast!

16:31.282 --> 16:34.445
No! I'm good!
Can you shut it off, please?

16:36.954 --> 16:39.696
Dr. Hood,
you can't drill in here.

16:40.708 --> 16:43.700
I need to measure P-waves
if I'm gonna find
this magma pocket.

16:43.836 --> 16:44.791
(STAMPING FOOT)

16:44.921 --> 16:47.833
This is the best spot
to crack through
the igneous uplift.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.581
Are you sure there's
really anything to find?

16:50.718 --> 16:51.833
Sure, I'm sure.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.927
I can hear the roaring,
| just haven't seen the tiger.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.884
Oh! You've talked to Allison.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.382
Mmm.
Uh-uh.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.602
There's something
happening here, Sheriff.
This isn't like Memphis.

17:02.730 --> 17:06.643
Maybe, but I still want
you to pack it up
and go home. Okay?

17:06.776 --> 17:12.021
Just let Global handle this.
And I need yourtunneling
car thingy off the road.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.117
Do you mind if I tow her home?
All above ground, I promise.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.737
I just want to wash her up
before she gets rusty.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.988
Sure. Sure.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.831
Okay. Thanks.
That's too bad.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.622
It was fun
getting dirty again.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.671
(SIGHING)

17:31.801 --> 17:35.339
This, this map
has got to be, what,
70 years old?

17:35.471 --> 17:36.460
Mmm.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.885
Ha! And what is it you,
you're gonna build here?

17:40.017 --> 17:41.393
A hotel.

17:41.519 --> 17:45.478
Our corporate visitors
are used to a certain
level of service.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.517
This spot is perfect.

17:47.984 --> 17:52.944
But I found records
that showed some traces
of radiation.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.270
Uh-huh.

17:54.615 --> 17:58.073
Well, you know,
radiation is like penny candy.

17:58.202 --> 18:02.536
It comes in all
different kinds of flavors.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.826
You think you can scan
something for me, correct?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.995
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
You know, but

18:07.795 --> 18:13.506
a wide-spectrum survey
is a very complicated process.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.710
You're my man.
Absolutely.

18:17.513 --> 18:21.256
She's a liar!
She actually accused me
of sabotage?

18:21.392 --> 18:23.804
Well, your name came up.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.303
I wouldn't touch
her crappy stuffed animal
with a ten-foot pole.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.477
Bet you're happy
Fifi's out of contention?

18:30.610 --> 18:31.850
Are you joking?

18:31.986 --> 18:35.649
This was my year
to finally crush her
in front of everyone.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.487
My dog is perfect.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.867
Yeah, he's a champ.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.206
You should see him run.
It's like Seabiscuit.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.996
Here, toss him one.

18:50.338 --> 18:54.047
All right. Hey, buddy.
You wanna run? You wanna run?

18:54.759 --> 18:57.466
I'm telling you right now,
he's a winner.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.099
WOMAN: What happened?

19:09.899 --> 19:12.891
What can you say?
He's such a great competitor.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.813
Yeah, and the second
one to blow.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.936
I sent Fifi to G.D.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.522
Take what's left of Thunder
and see what you can find.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.866
Wait. Wait.
I get to look inside?

19:21.994 --> 19:24.781
Yeah. I want
a complete dogtopsy.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.997

Oh, no, just...

19:33.464 --> 19:35.671
Is everything okay in there?

19:38.135 --> 19:40.251

you convinced me
to try this on.

19:40.388 --> 19:43.346
No one wears a big white dress
their second time around.

19:43.474 --> 19:44.964

you don't love it.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.966
lt's fabulous for an Amazon.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.219
Honey, you can't tell anything
without a fitting.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.435
I don't have time
for a fitting.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.600
l have a job,
and it's not planning
a wedding.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.815

Just get me out of this.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.059
lt's... It's not working.

20:31.188 --> 20:35.101

shorted the circuit.
Forget it.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.026
You called?

20:47.955 --> 20:49.786
You have something
to tell me?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.785
I do.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.077
Hood has been
tunneling again.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.825
I told you
to keep an eye on him.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.918
I am. He promised me
he wouldn't do it anymore.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.173
Promised? Promised?

20:58.299 --> 21:01.917
Okay, let me be
perfectly clear here.
I need him to stop.

21:02.511 --> 21:06.095
All right.
Dr. Hood? Hey,
we got to pack it up.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.681
Allison, a little fancy
for the afternoon,
but you pull it off.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.426
Do you know
why I'm in this dress?
Laundry day?

21:12.563 --> 21:15.555
Because you knocked out
half the circuits
on Main Street.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.814
There was a temblor?

21:17.943 --> 21:19.558
I knew one was coming.
When exactly?

21:19.695 --> 21:20.810
Ten minutes ago.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.198
And you knew because
you've been tunneling again?

21:23.324 --> 21:24.985
No. l was here
10 minutes ago.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.324

you want proof?

22:28.764 --> 22:31.927
All right, you,
you go that way
and then move...

22:33.018 --> 22:36.306
I like the neckline,
but not so crazy
about the color.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.140
We're sinking zero-balance
P-wave detectors
all along the ridge.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.984
l re-tasked the geo
satellites to look
for ground deformations.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.104
Sounds good.
What's all that
gonna tell us?

22:46.240 --> 22:48.151
Nothing. We just like
sounding smart.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.866
The fumarole proves that
there's pressurized magma
down there.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.735
Now, we have to find out
exactly where it is

22:52.872 --> 22:54.112
and how big of a problem
we have.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.159
Maybe Hood's our problem.
MAN: All right.

22:56.292 --> 22:59.250
Sure made quite a prediction,
and it seems like
he likes being top dog again.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.875
Really? You think
he could cause this?

23:04.008 --> 23:05.714
Well, that's what
the instruments
are gonna tell us.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.754
Hopefully before
they reach critical mass.

23:07.887 --> 23:08.967
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

23:10.055 --> 23:12.262
Carter. Yeah, look,
Fargo, I...

23:14.768 --> 23:16.019
Fine.

23:17.479 --> 23:21.097
Got to go.
Thorne's doggy dissection.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.525
Let me know if your probing
produces anything.

23:27.156 --> 23:29.442
Fargo, l have
a lava problem right now,

23:29.575 --> 23:31.941
and I don't have time
to worry about fake dogs.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.661
Ooh, well, do you have
time to worry about
national security?

23:35.789 --> 23:38.576
Logic diamonds,
it's how these dogs
always won.

23:38.709 --> 23:42.167
They were juicing,
but the neural nets
couldn't handle the load.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.829
I thought all these diamonds
were supposed to be
locked in a vault.

23:45.966 --> 23:49.458
Exactly, so not only
are they cheaters,
they broke federal law.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.301
Have fun in Gitmo, ladies.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.671
Relax. I'll talk to them.
I already tried that.

23:53.807 --> 23:57.766
They said they have no idea
how the diamonds got
into the dogs. Likely story.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.887
Okay, first, leave
the interrogations to me,

24:01.023 --> 24:06.108
and second,
if they both have diamonds,
we need to go to the source.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.026
It looks like
a logic diamond.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.523
Yes! J'accuse, Fifi!

24:12.660 --> 24:14.776
Well, I thought
all the diamonds were
under your supervision.

24:14.912 --> 24:17.824
These aren't from our lab.
The manufacturing facility
in Pensacola

24:17.957 --> 24:20.699
puts a code
on every diamond they make.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.034
The inventory is
continually checked.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.669
So, someone else
can make these?

24:26.340 --> 24:30.208
There's several countries
with covert programs,
China, North Korea.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.926
I'll check with intelligence,
see if they know of
any missing stones.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.637
All right, let me know
as soon as you get an answer.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.399
(GROANING)

24:45.818 --> 24:48.059
Do it.
Can't find the zipper?

24:49.071 --> 24:52.984
Oh. Yeah, I got MD
and two PhD's,

24:53.117 --> 24:55.153
and I can't get myself
out of this stupid dress.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.492
Thorne wants to see me
five minutes ago.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.610
Can you...
Yeah.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.408
Can you help? Thank you.
Yeah. Yeah.

25:00.541 --> 25:01.621
(SIGHING)

25:02.334 --> 25:04.290
I used to be
pretty good at this.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.251
The micro-lock is damaged.

25:06.797 --> 25:10.335
Yeah, it's like super-Velcro.
(LAUGHS) I know.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.542
(SIGHING) So, I should
have believed you

25:13.679 --> 25:14.919
when you told me
about the earthquake.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.465
No, you didn't feel it.
I know it sounds crazy.

25:16.598 --> 25:17.633
No.
Lean back.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.927
Coming from you,
I should have listened, and

25:20.060 --> 25:20.845
I don't know.
It's just the pressure.

25:20.978 --> 25:23.344
I feel like I've got
a million things
pushing in on me.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.469
Yeah, more.

25:24.606 --> 25:25.857
It's like I can't breathe,
like...

25:25.983 --> 25:28.190
Like you're trapped
in a wedding dress?
Little... Little more.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.024
Okay, it's just...

25:30.362 --> 25:31.442
Yeah. There. Got it.

25:31.572 --> 25:32.937
You got it?
Yeah.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.735
Oh, thank... Thank you.

25:35.868 --> 25:36.857
(LAUGHING)

25:48.672 --> 25:50.537
So is this why you called?

25:52.176 --> 25:53.336
No, I...

25:53.469 --> 25:57.087
We haven't been able to
pinpoint the magma pocket yet,

25:57.222 --> 26:01.306
but the resonance indicates
that it could be manmade.

26:04.897 --> 26:09.812
You're thinking
by a disgraced geologist
looking to fix his reputation?

26:10.569 --> 26:13.311
Well, pressure makes you
do crazy things.

26:16.742 --> 26:17.731
(SIGHS)

26:18.494 --> 26:21.110
There is this remarkable
jumble of radiation.

26:21.246 --> 26:24.909
I mean, here, where you want
to put your hotel,
there's everything

26:25.042 --> 26:27.624
from x-rays all the way
up through gamma.

26:27.753 --> 26:32.292
I mean, I'd love to know
why it's there,
but it's very powerful,

26:32.424 --> 26:34.289
and the source is right here.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.340
Interesting.

26:36.470 --> 26:39.758
And I'll give you
all the specific frequencies
once I've run the samples.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.005
That's not necessary.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.223
You've given me
all the information I need.

26:43.352 --> 26:46.936
It seems that
my hotel project's gonna have
to go back to square one.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.059
Wait.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.983
That's it?
No, that's it.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.820
All this clean-up
is gonna cost billions,

26:56.949 --> 26:59.861
and my intention is
to make money, not waste it,

26:59.993 --> 27:02.905
so I'm just gonna have to
find an alternate site.

27:03.789 --> 27:07.998
And Henry, you know,
property development
can get very contentious.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.834
So could we keep this
between us, for now?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.500
Mmm. Yeah, don't worry.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.087
I'm good at keeping secrets.

27:22.933 --> 27:26.016
How's it going?
HOOD: We could get
some nasty lava bombs.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.062
It'd be easier to predict
if I could find the pocket.

27:30.190 --> 27:33.728
Yeah, unless you already
know where it is.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.573
Allison thinks it's manmade.

27:39.992 --> 27:44.031
By some old volcano man
who wants one last ride
on the Ferris wheel?

27:45.956 --> 27:46.991
I'm just doing myjob.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.080
Some things you
don't mess with.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.667
Well, somebody did.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.128
Take a pretty fancy machine
to liquefy bedrock.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.748
Well, this town loves
its fancy machines.

27:57.885 --> 28:00.092
Yeah, nojoke.
These guys build dogs,

28:00.220 --> 28:02.962
they could probably figure out
how to light a volcano.

28:03.098 --> 28:05.089
Well, they both explode.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.595
I got dogs exploding
all over town and it...

28:11.732 --> 28:13.097
(LAUGHING)

28:16.111 --> 28:18.853
That's a dog show
I could get into.
Yeah.

28:18.989 --> 28:23.358
Hey, have you tried
finding out where
the diamonds were mined?

28:23.493 --> 28:25.199
Yeah. Yeah, no luck so far.

28:25.329 --> 28:28.537
Well, I could shoot yours
through the old
gas-liquid chromatograph.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.457
Only take a second,
might tell you
where they're from.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.201
All right.
All right.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.871
Every mine in the world
produces diamonds

28:38.008 --> 28:39.839
with a unique
molecular structure.

28:39.968 --> 28:43.756
Like a fingerprint?
Yeah, or a really
expensive snowflake.

28:43.889 --> 28:47.507
So it looks like
our little friend here
is all the way from...

28:49.186 --> 28:51.051
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:51.855 --> 28:56.315
Something's messed up here.
It says that the carbon
signature is from Eureka.

28:58.111 --> 29:00.318
Is there a diamond
mine here?

29:00.447 --> 29:01.653
No.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.947
But they used to mine coal.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.704
JO: We've been
down here an hour.
If we're looking for diamonds,

29:10.832 --> 29:13.869
shouldn't we be in a spooky,
old diamond mine?

29:14.002 --> 29:17.119
CARTER: You mean,
instead of a spooky,
old coal mine?

29:18.215 --> 29:21.332
HOOD: Yeah, but the system
told us it came from
this anthracite vein.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.299
It's weird, I know.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.463
(EXCLAIMING)

29:30.227 --> 29:31.342
Wow.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.846
Sheriff, look at this.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.396
That's not coal.

29:40.654 --> 29:41.939
Raw diamonds,

29:44.241 --> 29:46.277
but they're not natural.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.150
Someone's transforming
the anthracite

29:48.287 --> 29:51.120
into isometric-hexoctahedral
carbon 14.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.747
Someone's cooking
logic diamonds.

29:54.876 --> 29:55.911
Look out!

29:56.044 --> 29:57.033
(EXCLAIMING)

29:57.754 --> 29:58.869

30:18.233 --> 30:19.222
(GROANING)

30:23.238 --> 30:24.899
I'm okay. I'm okay.
It's just my arm.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.522
Well, what was that,
a security system?

30:26.658 --> 30:29.115
No, I'm an idiot.
It's an acoustic
wave generator.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.826
They're using
intermittent bursts. We just
happened to get caught.

30:31.955 --> 30:35.038
Somebody's growing
these diamonds
with rayl pressure waves,

30:35.167 --> 30:36.828
and they're doing it
on a massive scale.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.871
Hold on. Rayl waves?

30:39.004 --> 30:41.871
Well, Zoe was studying
with one of those things
today at Cafe Diem,

30:42.007 --> 30:46.125
and it could melt metal.
Could it melt rock?

30:46.678 --> 30:48.214
I'm with you, Sheriff.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.678
I'm not.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.381
The diamond oven
is shooting waves
into the ground.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.224
And rayl pressure waves
can melt iron ore
in the rock strata.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.221
Melted rocks make magma,
and where the magma's
under pressure...

30:58.357 --> 31:00.143
There's a volcano.

31:01.735 --> 31:02.850
Yeah,

31:04.112 --> 31:06.023
but who's cooking diamonds?

31:06.156 --> 31:08.647
I talked to Dr. Zedler
at the Pensacola facility.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.526
There are only six people
in the world who know
how to make logic diamonds,

31:11.661 --> 31:12.992
and they're all on his team.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.907
All right, so they're all
3,000 miles away from here?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.371
Yes. Confirmed
by D.O.D. security.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.957
You think your people
turn up something from
one of the other programs?

31:19.086 --> 31:19.950
What other programs?

31:20.087 --> 31:21.918
You know. I don't know.
North Korea, China.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.129
Carter, no one else
has a logic diamond program,

31:24.257 --> 31:26.122
not even in
the theoretical stages.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.090
We are 30 years
ahead of the world on this.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.131
I got to see
your personnel files.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.216
You spent
three years in Pensacola

31:32.349 --> 31:34.214
while the neural core
was being designed.

31:34.351 --> 31:37.593
Dr. Zedler said you asked
a lot of questions about
how to grow logic diamonds,

31:37.729 --> 31:39.936
said you became
a real expert.

31:43.068 --> 31:46.356
You spend your entire career
creating something amazing,

31:46.488 --> 31:49.230
and when you finally succeed,
they just lock it all away.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.197
Are there
any more diamond farms?

31:51.326 --> 31:53.442
I only grew them
because I didn't want
to steal them.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.445
Don't you see?
These diamonds
could change the world,

31:56.581 --> 31:58.492
but the DOD.
just want to use them
to make better weapons.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.332
G.D. is a science facility,
not a weapons factory.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.122
It's a top-secret lab.

32:03.255 --> 32:06.497
I could never test
my diamonds. That's why
I put them in the dogs.

32:07.134 --> 32:08.465
Wait, wait, to test them?

32:08.593 --> 32:11.505
Those dogs have
the most advanced
neural processors around.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.050
Mimicking a biological
organism is the best way

32:14.182 --> 32:16.639
to test the diamonds
under real-world conditions.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.269
l was helping out
a few of the entrants.

32:18.395 --> 32:20.556
I just built the diamonds
into the circuits.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.975
I had no idea
they would overload.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.482
Or that you'd
caused a volcano?

32:26.736 --> 32:27.987
Pardon?

32:28.113 --> 32:30.069
ALLISON: Even though
we shut down the generator
in the mine,

32:30.198 --> 32:32.359
the seismic activity
is continuing to increase.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.232
That magma's
under incredible pressure.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.576
If it blows, Eureka could be
scattered over four states.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.115
There could be
thousands of casualties.

32:38.248 --> 32:39.658
We should begin evacuation.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.452
No, it could
explode at any time.

32:41.585 --> 32:42.916
I don't want people
out on the street.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.830
It'll be much safer
if they're inside.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.625
Could you drill in
and relieve the pressure?

32:47.757 --> 32:49.793
You know,
just lance the puppy?

32:49.926 --> 32:52.008
Well, we have no idea
where this puppy is.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.629
Thermal energy travels
along the rock strata
until it finds a pocket.

32:55.765 --> 32:57.175
It could be anywhere.
ALLISON: Wait a minute.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.927
What if we cut a tunnel?
Get close to the pocket,
bore straight to the lake,

33:01.062 --> 33:03.849
then use remote explosives
to fracture the containment
rock.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.062
That would divert the magma?

33:05.192 --> 33:06.728
And we still have to find it.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.943
Well, you guys have got
to have a gizmo in
this building that can help.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.686
Right?
Start knocking on doors.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.200
Just put a note
in the elevator...

33:14.326 --> 33:17.284
Yeah, Carter,
there's no gizmo
for sniffing out magma

33:17.412 --> 33:19.368
2,000 feet
below the earth's surface,

33:19.498 --> 33:21.113
but maybe we can get
the director on that.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.786
Well, I'm not talking
about sniffing...

33:26.046 --> 33:29.834
lgotanidea.
Just tell me
if it's incredibly stupid.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.126
Yes.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.260
Is it possible?

33:36.389 --> 33:40.007
This technology can help
soldiers sniff out explosives.

33:40.143 --> 33:41.849
We can fix Fifi to help us.

33:41.978 --> 33:46.312
Similar technology,
but real dogs
can't sniff out magma.

33:46.441 --> 33:49.649
If we reprogrammed her
and jacked up
the sensitivity...

33:49.986 --> 33:51.726
That would take weeks.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.479
Well...

33:57.994 --> 33:59.950
With this.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.698
It's Dr. Mendel's
artificial mucus.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.453
It could supercharge
Fifi's nose.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.046
I think

34:13.843 --> 34:15.049
Fifi

34:15.971 --> 34:19.179
was born to be a hero,

34:21.351 --> 34:24.058
heroine. Don't you?

34:31.403 --> 34:32.984
Smell the lava. Good girl.

34:33.113 --> 34:34.853
Smell the lava.
Oh, good girl!

34:34.990 --> 34:38.778
Smell the lava. right there.
Good girl. Good girl.
Smell the lava. Good girl.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.116
I hate to interrupt
puppy school,

34:40.245 --> 34:41.735
but the seismic
pressure is building.

34:41.871 --> 34:44.203
I think Fifi's almost ready,
although I don't think
she's that thrilled

34:44.332 --> 34:46.118
about carrying live explosives
into a volcano.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.412
I know, but you're gonna need
them to release the magma.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.831
All right. Can't we just
poke a hole in it,
relieve the pressure?

34:50.964 --> 34:52.920
Sure, if you wanna be
a charcoal briquette.

34:53.049 --> 34:55.040
The magma's 3,000 degrees.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.837
It's gonna break through
and fire down the tunnel

34:56.970 --> 34:58.005
to the lake
at 80 feet per second.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.299
You want to be long gone
when that happens.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.717
All right. All right.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.056
Breaking through, bad,
running away, good.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.641
Got it. All right,
Fifi, let's go!

35:06.730 --> 35:07.936
(FIFI BARKING)

35:11.401 --> 35:12.937
In you go!

35:17.949 --> 35:20.156
All right, Fifi,
you ready for this?

35:20.285 --> 35:24.028
Yeah, she's got a new nose.
It's topped off with mucus,

35:24.164 --> 35:27.372
ready to find some lava.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.001
It's not lava.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.000
Which way, girl?

35:38.011 --> 35:39.672
Here goes nothing.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.000
WORKER 1: I don't like
that burns that are
smoldering!

36:16.132 --> 36:17.838
WORKER 2: More, too!
WORKER 3: Let's close it off!

36:17.967 --> 36:18.922
WORKER 1: I'll tw!

36:19.052 --> 36:20.041
Carter.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.885
Nathan, what's the status
down there?

36:23.598 --> 36:24.587
Uh...

36:24.933 --> 36:27.720
I think Carter's dog
has us chasing our tails.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.645
Fifi, don't make me stop
this tunneler, Fifi!

36:32.607 --> 36:35.019
We have methane vents
popping all over town.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.812
Nice big ones!

36:37.070 --> 36:38.230
(LAUGHING)

36:45.412 --> 36:46.572
Still nothing.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.111
(BARKING)

36:48.248 --> 36:50.864
Wait. Wait,
we might have something!

36:54.796 --> 36:56.457
All right, Fifi.

36:57.298 --> 37:00.040
Come on. Come on!
Let's go find some lava.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.467
Magma. It's magma.

37:03.596 --> 37:04.847
(CARTER GROANING)

37:06.891 --> 37:11.134
It's lava
when it's above ground,
magma when it's below.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.891
What, so you think
I'm confusing the dog?

37:14.023 --> 37:15.604
Well, you're exhausting me.

37:15.734 --> 37:16.894
We got heat.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.404
Let's just set
these explosives
right by the melt...

37:28.288 --> 37:31.826
We're not gonna need them.
Come here, Fifi. Come here!

37:31.958 --> 37:34.040
Magma's breaking through. Run!

37:38.548 --> 37:39.708
Fifi!

37:43.303 --> 37:44.839
Didn't you say
we should be long gone
when this happens?

37:44.971 --> 37:46.882
Yes, I did!
Drive, Carter! Drive!

37:47.015 --> 37:48.004
(GROANS)

38:00.779 --> 38:02.895
The pressure's dropping.
Did you find something?

38:03.198 --> 38:05.189
CARTER: Oh, you could
say that!

38:06.326 --> 38:07.736
Hey, where's the lake?

38:07.869 --> 38:10.155
I can't get a bearing.
The instruments are
all over the place.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.994
Smack it.
Seriously?

38:12.123 --> 38:13.329
Smack it.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.578
(BEEPING)

38:16.711 --> 38:18.827
All right!
I got a bearing.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.079
Turn right, 15 degrees.

38:22.342 --> 38:23.422
Should be straight ahead.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.757
Should be?

38:45.865 --> 38:46.854
(GROANING)

38:51.788 --> 38:53.073
(EXHALES)

38:54.833 --> 38:56.869
Next time, Fargo's driving.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.043
(WHINING)

39:03.091 --> 39:04.877
They made it through.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.232
So, what do you want
to do tomorrow?

39:28.157 --> 39:30.944
Vincent,
iced coffee, please?
On the way.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.533
Steamy out there tonight.

39:32.662 --> 39:35.779
Well, get used to it.
That magma's gonna be
venting for days.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.076
I think, technically,
it's lava.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.120
So, you guys
did good work today.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.414
You should team up
more often.

39:44.591 --> 39:46.206
BOTH: Yeah.

39:46.342 --> 39:49.675
I'm thinking this town
should buy you boys
a drink.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.546
Well, you know,
it was kind of fun.

39:53.266 --> 39:55.473
I mean, besides almost dying,
I can see why you miss it.

39:55.602 --> 39:57.888
Honestly, I don't.
I like the quiet life.

39:58.021 --> 40:00.933
Living with
that kind of pressure
isn't for me anymore.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.807
Hey, Carter,
good driving today.

40:04.527 --> 40:05.903
Thanks.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.354
(SPARKY BARKING)
Thanks.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.900
I'm the king of the world!

40:11.034 --> 40:14.367
Hey! Congratulations!
Robot Dog Show champ.

40:14.495 --> 40:15.826
Thank you, thank you.
NATHAN: Fargo!

40:15.955 --> 40:19.163
I'd like to thank everyone
who made this possible,
mostly myself.

40:19.292 --> 40:20.828
Yeah, well, nothing like
a gracious winner.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.703
I got to tell you,
it's absolutely amazing.
Come here, buddy.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.922
Yeah. I mean, it's so real.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.258
(TRICKLING)
Mmm...

40:31.971 --> 40:33.927
I thought fake dogs don't...

40:34.057 --> 40:36.173
Well, yeah, just...
I'll see you later.

40:38.519 --> 40:39.508
That's nice.

40:43.608 --> 40:44.973
Hey.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.690
Interested in a game?

40:46.819 --> 40:51.062
No, I should go home
and change my pants
because Fargo is a cheater.

40:51.199 --> 40:53.656
(LAUGHING) Sparky?

40:54.243 --> 40:57.952
Oh! Well, you know,
pressure can be
a very destructive force.

40:58.790 --> 40:59.779
Oh!

41:00.291 --> 41:04.159
Did you ever finish
that troubling errand?

41:04.295 --> 41:06.206
I certainly did.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.677
How was Thorne?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.714
You're very perceptive, Jack.

41:14.222 --> 41:17.339
I do know the type,
and they don't do good deeds.

41:18.017 --> 41:21.635
She had me run
a radiation survey
outside of town.

41:21.771 --> 41:25.980
Now, have you ever heard
of Baryogenic radiation?

41:27.068 --> 41:27.898
No.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.688
Well, that's because
it doesn't exist.
It's only a theory.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.858
At least I thought so
until today.

41:32.991 --> 41:36.074
You found some?
Just a trace.

41:36.452 --> 41:39.615
Well, great, great.
Is it dangerous?

41:39.747 --> 41:40.998
l have all the data
in my garage.

41:41.124 --> 41:41.954
I'll run you
through it tomorrow.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.948
Great. Thanks.
All right.

41:44.085 --> 41:47.953
Hey, Henry! Thanks for being
on my side with this.

41:48.089 --> 41:51.047
Hey, I do not keep secrets
from my friends.

41:52.677 --> 41:53.883
Anymore.

41:56.889 --> 41:57.878
Hmm.

41:59.058 --> 42:01.970
SARAH: Sheriff Carter,
you planned to do
aerobic exercise tonight

42:02.103 --> 42:04.560
from 8:00 to 9:30,
followed by bill paying.

42:04.689 --> 42:05.804
Yeah, I'm taking
the night off.

42:05.940 --> 42:09.148
SARAH: Good idea.
Stress is America's
number one health problem.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.266
Oh, drop that.

42:10.403 --> 42:12.143
Followed closely by sarcasm.

42:12.280 --> 42:15.522
Hey, you want some chips?
I was just gonna sit down
and watch the game?

42:15.658 --> 42:18.240
No, I had a PowerBar
at the library. I'll see you.

42:18.369 --> 42:21.236
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

42:23.041 --> 42:26.579
To study. There's a physics
quiz tomorrow and

42:26.711 --> 42:29.373
I really, really, really
want to get an A.

42:29.505 --> 42:30.790
Okay.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.462
Just do your best, all right?

42:36.387 --> 42:37.627
Thanks.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.846
You need some help?

42:41.809 --> 42:45.142
Sure. How much
you know about
calculating electron mass?

42:47.231 --> 42:48.482
Nothing.

42:48.608 --> 42:51.645
But I do know that
everything's a little easier

42:51.778 --> 42:56.317
if you're having some pizza.
So sit down.

42:56.449 --> 42:59.111
Crack the books,
and I'll order.

43:01.162 --> 43:02.368
Okay.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.112
I'm proud of you.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.086
Extra mushrooms, right?

43:12.215 --> 43:14.046
You know me so well.

43:14.884 --> 43:15.999
Awesome.
