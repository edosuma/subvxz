WEBVTT

00:26.051 --> 00:29.951
Well, it all started with the big one
professor Ostergaard

00:34.116 --> 00:36.716
The exploration of capabilities
of the human mind

00:46.532 --> 00:50.184
We have discovered that the Paraversum
very much like our own world,

01:00.589 --> 01:03.661
The CIA had been operating since the 1950s
to MK-Ultra.

01:04.650 --> 01:08.366
And the Russians did their research
from psychokinesis in the same period.

01:15.477 --> 01:19.017
More recently, the US Navy had
Department G

01:19.034 --> 01:25.122
and we here at Wytness already have
worked in this field for about 25 years.

01:35.255 --> 01:39.243
It is only now that we are able
are to see behind the curtain.

01:40.665 --> 01:43.532
And with it the emptiness between the worlds.

01:51.941 --> 01:54.408
to a staggering new dimension.

06:39.516 --> 06:40.916
<i> I don't think so. </i>

06:42.433 --> 06:44.700
<i> I think we are safe until ... </i>

07:53.913 --> 07:55.273
I have to get out of here.

08:38.634 --> 08:40.313
There is no way out.

14:26.346 --> 14:28.479
We wanted the subject to be
felt threatened

14:29.217 --> 14:30.657
and in real danger.

16:04.131 --> 16:07.731
<i> ... subject is disabled ...
We have to ask for a reset. </i>

16:08.313 --> 16:11.577
- ... not true.  Wait!  Is she...
- We're going to reset!

22:58.670 --> 23:00.030
Find the keys.

23:51.534 --> 23:52.534
How?

25:19.310 --> 25:20.310
Hello?

25:51.630 --> 25:52.630
Wait!

26:05.014 --> 26:06.014
Hello?

26:35.250 --> 26:36.770
The car does not start.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.478
How did I know?

26:52.558 --> 26:55.558
So weird.
I knew it.

27:13.177 --> 27:20.515
BEACON HALL, 377891
NORTH SECTOR

27:32.490 --> 27:33.490
Hello?

32:10.241 --> 32:11.241
Shit!

32:40.611 --> 32:44.711
<i> ... Ostergaard, I'm head of the
scientific research facility ... </i>

32:55.391 --> 32:57.124
Wytness Research Center

33:39.037 --> 33:40.237
This is not right.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.223
What?

39:17.824 --> 39:19.504
<i> Hi, can you hear me? </i>

39:19.962 --> 39:22.162
Yes Yes!
Oh God...

39:37.520 --> 39:38.753
Just tell me where you are.

39:38.847 --> 39:39.847
<i> They hurt me. </i>

40:17.180 --> 40:18.180
Damn!

40:46.730 --> 40:49.130
Okay, South is down.
No ... Left?

41:23.136 --> 41:24.176
What the fuck?

41:51.234 --> 41:53.234
Damn!

41:56.113 --> 41:59.249
Same-day repeat offers
us the constant,

42:01.640 --> 42:06.248
Be able to reset subjects
as their psychological indicators

42:17.695 --> 42:20.639
And finally
to control reality itself.

43:27.586 --> 43:28.586
Okay...

46:01.431 --> 46:03.111
Hi, is anyone there?

46:44.033 --> 46:45.033
<i> Hello? </i>

46:48.411 --> 46:50.091
Yes, hello, I can hear you.

46:52.934 --> 46:56.514
Hello, are you still there?
<i> - I am here. </i>

46:58.257 --> 46:59.857
<i> Where have you been? </i>

47:02.314 --> 47:05.014
What happened before
where did you go?

47:19.419 --> 47:21.152
I haven't seen anyone yet.

47:25.468 --> 47:30.452
I'm trying to get somewhere.
It's a research center.

47:31.230 --> 47:34.558
I do not know why,
but i think it can help.

47:36.989 --> 47:40.381
Wait, did you just say Wytness?
That is it.  That's the place.

47:42.462 --> 47:44.142
Hello, are you still there?

47:48.528 --> 47:51.984
See if you can hear me
then meet me at Wytness.

47:56.487 --> 47:57.487
Hello?

49:36.119 --> 49:37.986
What do we do when we find her?

49:38.071 --> 49:39.131
Reset again?

49:39.219 --> 49:41.319
No, drop her in the woods.
Watch what she does.

49:41.862 --> 49:44.162
Hmm.  She's pretty smart.
Why the rush?

51:44.387 --> 51:46.067
I'm still here.

51:47.871 --> 51:49.551
I did not go back.

53:42.155 --> 53:44.422
Oh no,
you're kidding me.

53:47.489 --> 53:48.489
Damn!

54:07.130 --> 54:09.930
No, wait a minute.
That can't be right.

54:38.515 --> 54:45.095
<i> Every choice made creates an infinite amount
possibilities and endless worlds, </i>

54:45.181 --> 54:48.081
<i> in which every possible outcome exists. </i>

54:49.440 --> 54:55.873
<i> One person can see those possibilities
and choose the outcome we want. </i>

55:28.105 --> 55:31.705
<i> Every choice made creates an infinite amount
possibilities ... </i>

55:32.211 --> 55:34.711
<i> .. choose the desired outcome. </i>

56:47.352 --> 56:49.219
Endless possibilities.

56:52.592 --> 56:55.592
Endless possibilities.

57:27.674 --> 57:28.674
Come on.

58:22.421 --> 58:23.421
Okay.

58:39.384 --> 58:40.384
Ooow!

58:54.486 --> 58:55.826
Where are we?

59:19.684 --> 59:20.924
<i> Where are you? </i>

59:28.154 --> 59:31.534
<i> I am close.
Maybe two or three miles to Wytness. </i>

01:02:05.318 --> 01:02:06.518
What is that?

01:04:30.459 --> 01:04:34.459
Excuse me, hello?
Hello, hey!

01:04:41.689 --> 01:04:43.369
Hello, can you hear me?

01:20:01.644 --> 01:20:04.311
See?
I told you already.

01:20:27.016 --> 01:20:29.416
You do not believe me.
I know.

01:20:33.516 --> 01:20:36.580
This is not the first time
you repeated it.

01:20:36.644 --> 01:20:38.324
Not the last time either.
