00:01.740 --> 00:02.611
<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty...

00:02.654 --> 00:03.960
The Moldavian oil was tainted

00:04.004 --> 00:05.614
causing an explosion
in the refinery.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.659
Blake lost
half a billion dollars.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.052
And this is
just the beginning.

00:09.096 --> 00:11.141
What do we do now?

00:11.185 --> 00:13.187
I can't do this anymore.
We're not happy.

00:13.230 --> 00:14.840
<i>We barely know
who we are anymore.</i>

00:14.884 --> 00:16.146
-They pulled the
plug on the show.

00:16.190 --> 00:18.061
Fine.
We'll do bigger things now.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.367
<i>I'm getting married.</i>

00:19.410 --> 00:21.064
I think it's best
that we don't go out

00:21.108 --> 00:22.283
or see each other.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.067
<i>Adam's dangerous.</i>

00:24.111 --> 00:25.547
<i>He has a history
of hurting people.</i>

00:25.590 --> 00:26.983
You don't like
that I'm dating Adam,

00:27.027 --> 00:28.506
and you're using lies
to break us up.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.508
So what are you
going to be doing up north?

00:30.552 --> 00:32.641
-Some fly-fishing?
-More like hunting.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.077
Feel free to skip
the wedding, Laura.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.688
I'm sure Liam can find
someone just as cold

00:36.732 --> 00:38.777
and unfeeling to walk him
down the aisle.

Yes, Melinda.

There is a problem.

The cake topper was
supposed to be gold,

not crystal.

01:42.928 --> 01:44.191
I don't see any gold.

Do you think Sven is trying
to sabotage our wedding?

01:55.202 --> 01:56.507
Of course not.

01:56.551 --> 01:57.813
I also don't know who Sven is.

Hey, hey, look.

which cake topper we use.

Ah, this photo shoot
was a fabulous idea.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.813
If you do say so yourself.

02:41.857 --> 02:45.643
We are about to dethrone
Atlanta's mad king.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.863
People need to see us for
the power couple that we are.

02:47.906 --> 02:49.560
Alexis, I told you

02:49.604 --> 02:51.954
I want to take it slow
-on that front, okay?
-I know.

02:51.997 --> 02:55.131
But now that Carrington Atlantic
is essentially worthless,

02:55.175 --> 02:58.090
we are just one move
from crushing Blake for good.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.701
Well, when you put it that way.

02:59.744 --> 03:02.182
-Mm.
-I'm gonna get changed
into my poolside look.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.840
You actually told
Anders about the fire?

03:08.884 --> 03:11.321
-What were you thinking?
-Don't get your
scrubs in a bunch.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.410
He asked about the
accident, but I kept

03:13.454 --> 03:15.412
my mouth shut, which
means he's guessing.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.806
But he's not letting go of it
because I'm dating Kirby.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.504
Well, there's an easy
solution to that.

03:20.548 --> 03:23.420
Stop schtupping
his evil spawn.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.030
He's like this starving dog

03:25.074 --> 03:26.815
looking for a bone,
and he just wants to sink

03:26.858 --> 03:28.512
his teeth into me,
if not for the fire,

03:28.556 --> 03:30.297
-then for something else.
-If he is, in fact,

03:30.340 --> 03:32.560
digging for more bones,
then you better get that old dog

03:32.603 --> 03:35.389
off the scent and make sure
he doesn't find any.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.569
Ms. Devereaux,
your guest has arrived.

03:41.612 --> 03:43.005
Barbara.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.616
My business partner
in crime.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.836
Looking fantastic
as always.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.751
Dominique. A pleasure.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.753
I wanted to check in,
since we begin production

03:51.796 --> 03:53.711
on Doma-sleek in a few days.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.452
I'm glad you called.

03:55.496 --> 03:58.194
We need to discuss <i>House
of Deveraux'scancellation.</i>

03:58.238 --> 04:00.283
Oh, that?

04:00.327 --> 04:01.328
That's good news.

04:01.371 --> 04:02.894
Please, sit.

04:02.938 --> 04:07.072
Now we can rebrand as a
fashion-focused company,

04:07.116 --> 04:09.292
using my name to expand

04:09.336 --> 04:11.990
the sleepwear line
into an empire.

04:12.034 --> 04:14.123
I agreed to fund your line
because I was promised

04:14.166 --> 04:17.518
free advertising
and placement via the show.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.259
Since that's
no longer happening,

04:19.302 --> 04:20.782
neither is
my investment.

04:20.825 --> 04:23.219
It's just too much risk
for minimal reward.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.135
What if I can relieve
some of that up-front risk?

04:26.178 --> 04:29.791
I can probably
scrape together 25%.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.227
Twenty-five.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.750
Double that,
and I'll consider it.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.927
With production starting
in three days?

04:35.971 --> 04:37.538
How do you expect me

04:37.581 --> 04:39.496
to come up with that much cash
that quickly?

04:39.540 --> 04:41.933
You're a Carrington-Colby,
right?

04:43.021 --> 04:44.632
I'm sure you'll find a way.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.852
<i>I just convinced</i>

04:47.896 --> 04:49.593
Eric Fischer with
Skadden Savings and Loan

04:49.637 --> 04:51.639
to hear my short-term
loan proposal.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.728
And if he approves, we can
buy enough oil to cover

04:53.771 --> 04:55.425
what we lost in the
refinery explosion

04:55.469 --> 04:57.340
-and save our asses.
-What's our timeline?

04:57.384 --> 05:00.822
48 hours to secure the loan
and replenish our supply

05:00.865 --> 05:02.911
or we default on
all our current contracts

05:02.954 --> 05:05.479
and completely bankrupt
Carrington Atlantic.

05:05.522 --> 05:08.351
-Oh, so no pressure then.
-Problem is,
Eric can only meet at 1:00.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.701
I'm already meeting Cristal
at La Mirage at noon.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.443
She's finally giving me
a chance to apologize.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.967
So I'm having Eric meet me
at the hotel.

05:16.011 --> 05:18.927
I cannot reschedule Cristal
for business.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.885
Can't Anders meet with Eric
until you're free?

05:20.929 --> 05:22.322
He's out of town.

05:22.365 --> 05:23.627
He went to
the refinery explosion site.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.325
He's been incommunicado since.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.805
That's unusual for Anders.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.677
Listen, the point is,

05:29.720 --> 05:32.027
I need to get this loan
to save CA,

05:32.070 --> 05:34.290
reconcile with Cristal
to save my marriage...

05:35.291 --> 05:37.815
...and ask you
for one small favor.

05:37.859 --> 05:40.731
So I think that does it.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.603
Yeah.

05:42.646 --> 05:45.214
You know, uh, I'm really glad we
were able to do this in person.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.347
Me, too. I can't believe
you were planning

05:47.390 --> 05:48.957
a visit to Atlanta anyway.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.176
It's like our annulment
was meant to be.

05:51.220 --> 05:54.092
Well, you know, now
seemed like a good time as any

05:54.136 --> 05:55.746
to check out
Western Atlanta law school.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.487
I do wish that we had

05:57.531 --> 05:59.924
time for one last drink,
but, uh,

05:59.968 --> 06:01.622
my flight leaves
in two hours.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.406
Well ...ah.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.886
...it was fun while it lasted.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.322
Yeah.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.324
I guess this is goodbye.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.719
Here's looking at you, kid.

06:11.762 --> 06:14.417
Did you just quote <i>Casablanca?</i>

06:14.461 --> 06:16.071
Yeah, I'm sorry, uh,

06:16.114 --> 06:18.116
sometimes I hide
behind movie lines

06:18.160 --> 06:19.640
when I'm nervous.

06:19.683 --> 06:22.294
"Play it again, Sam."

06:23.948 --> 06:26.298
Take care, Ryan.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.126
Yeah.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.438
♪ Here comes
the mother of the bride ♪

06:35.482 --> 06:36.700
♪ All dressed in

06:36.744 --> 06:37.919
♪ Red.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.573
Or is this more of a crimson?

06:39.616 --> 06:40.791
Well, maybe--

06:40.835 --> 06:42.053
Oh, my word.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.012
Is this Liam's head?

06:44.055 --> 06:45.579
Dial it down,
Gloria Swanson.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.276
It was a small accident.

06:47.319 --> 06:48.538
And I heard
your florist backed out.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.192
I told you not to berate her.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.760
I gave her some constructive
criticism about carnations.

06:52.803 --> 06:54.849
Okay, who's ready
for a wedding rehearsal?

06:54.892 --> 06:56.807
Fallon, have you finished
collecting your "somethings"?

06:56.851 --> 06:59.201
You know, "borrowed,
blue, old, new"?

06:59.244 --> 07:03.335
No, because I have something
more important to do.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.642
Like finding Blake
so we can leave for the church.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.731
I'll get him.
-The florist, the decapitation?

07:07.775 --> 07:09.907
Make total sense now. Omens.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.256
You can't ignore tradition,

07:11.300 --> 07:13.171
at least not
in this family.

07:13.215 --> 07:15.043
Great Aunt Maude
dismissed the custom

07:15.086 --> 07:16.697
and broke her hip
on her wedding day.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.046
Is that what you want?

07:18.089 --> 07:20.004
Maude was 98
when she got married.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.876
It would've been a little weird
if she didn't break her hip.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.921
Fine. Ignore the lore
at your own peril.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.706
But don't get upset
when it rains

07:25.749 --> 07:27.229
on your wedding day.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.927
Well, my wedding is indoors,

07:29.971 --> 07:32.408
so... it can't happen.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.844
Hi.

07:33.888 --> 07:37.326
Fallon, hi. So, small setback.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.110
A pipe burst here at the church.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.590
It's completely flooded,

07:40.634 --> 07:42.287
and it won't be fixed
in time for the wedding.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.554
Don't say a word.

08:13.057 --> 08:15.930
Hey, so the church
is officially a wash.

08:15.973 --> 08:18.149
Okay, poor choice there, but
Melinda confirmed that it is

08:18.193 --> 08:20.195
possible to move everything
here to the manor.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.327
Yeah, that's why I suggested it.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.981
Okay, I'm not sure
why you're mad at me.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.940
You're the one that said
nothing's gonna stop us.

08:25.983 --> 08:28.725
You and your cliché
Jefferson Starship lyrics.

08:28.769 --> 08:30.118
I think you're overreacting
a little,

08:30.161 --> 08:31.641
and not just to the lyrics.

08:31.685 --> 08:32.729
Am I, really?

08:32.773 --> 08:34.731
The cake topper, the florist,

08:34.775 --> 08:37.647
the literal rain
on our indoor wedding day,

08:37.691 --> 08:41.085
and now Monica is stuck across
the world until next week.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.174
It's something about
construction delays

08:43.218 --> 08:44.524
on her new school
for girls.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.395
I mean, children can be
so selfish.

08:46.438 --> 08:47.918
What are you doing?

08:47.962 --> 08:49.485
I am looking for
my "somethings."

08:49.529 --> 08:50.921
Okay? And the way
things are trending,

08:50.965 --> 08:52.575
I am gonna end up
like Aunt Maude.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.011
I mean, do you want me
limping down the aisle?

08:54.055 --> 08:55.796
Look, I know
this seems silly,

08:55.839 --> 08:58.320
but if following some outdated
tradition will help things

08:58.363 --> 09:00.104
go smoothly,
then I'm gonna do it.

09:00.148 --> 09:03.673
Plus, I found the perfect
"something new," okay?

09:03.717 --> 09:05.632
I read online that
"something new" should symbolize

09:05.675 --> 09:07.590
the couple's journey together,

09:07.634 --> 09:12.552
so I thought, "What better way
to ride into our new lives

09:12.595 --> 09:14.554
than in a self-driving car?"

09:15.555 --> 09:17.992
I mean, I don't believe in
any of this superstitious stuff,

09:18.035 --> 09:19.950
but I won't say no
to that bad boy.

09:19.994 --> 09:23.432
One down, three to go.

09:29.307 --> 09:30.395
Hi.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.483
Sorry I'm late.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.007
Yeah, no problem.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.138
I'm just happy
to see you.

09:34.182 --> 09:35.618
You ordered for us?

09:35.662 --> 09:36.924
Um...

09:36.967 --> 09:38.795
I know that your clinic schedule

09:38.839 --> 09:41.102
is tight at the hospital,
and I wanted you to be able

09:41.145 --> 09:42.756
to eat during your break.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.758
Well, to be honest,
I'm not really hungry.

09:44.801 --> 09:47.630
Yeah, I haven't had much of
an appetite these days, either.

09:49.980 --> 09:53.201
I know that I prioritized work
over you too many times.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.985
I'm sorry.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.944
Can we fix this?

09:56.987 --> 10:00.600
We'll always have
busy, demanding lives,

10:00.643 --> 10:04.038
but I deserve a husband who
will show up when I need him.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.823
Oh, you deserve that
and so much more.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.570
What are you doing?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.441
Leveling with you.

10:18.269 --> 10:20.010
I love you, Cristal Carrington.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.621
I'm a mess without you.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.057
Please come home.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.799
I'm a mess, too.

10:27.191 --> 10:29.063
But it's gonna take
a lot more than a salad

10:29.106 --> 10:31.065
and an apology
to make things right.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.981
Well, I could fly in
some lobster.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.421
It's Adam.

10:39.464 --> 10:40.901
He's at the clinic, um...

10:40.944 --> 10:42.859
Some issue
with the new contractor.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.382
Oh.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.515
I need to go.

10:46.558 --> 10:50.127
I apologize,
but I imagine you understand.

10:50.171 --> 10:53.304
Well, I was hoping that
we could have more time to talk,

10:53.348 --> 10:55.132
but, um...

10:55.176 --> 10:57.047
Can we continue
this conversation

10:57.091 --> 10:58.440
at Fallon's
rehearsal dinner?

10:58.483 --> 10:59.659
Yeah. I'll see you there.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.580
Excuse me.
I need this, uh,

11:08.624 --> 11:10.234
cleared up
before my next guest arrives.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.497
Which will be any
second now. Thank you.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.587
Don't look so bored.

11:15.631 --> 11:18.155
If you want this Atlantix event
to be a success,

11:18.199 --> 11:20.201
it's the details
that count, okay?

11:20.244 --> 11:24.074
Now, for the seated dinner,
which shade do you prefer?

11:24.118 --> 11:25.728
They look exactly the same.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.470
Straight people are exhausting.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.254
I like Snow Leopard.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.908
Brushed linen always
reminds me of

11:31.952 --> 11:33.518
-church robes.
-Church robes.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.782
What are you doing here?

11:35.825 --> 11:37.566
Well, my flight
got canceled.

11:37.609 --> 11:41.396
Maybe the universe wanted us
to have that drink after all.

11:41.439 --> 11:44.138
Do you think the universe
could help me navigate

11:44.181 --> 11:45.530
these napkins first?

11:47.576 --> 11:50.274
Uh, you know what,
he's right.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.886
I'm sorry. I'm totally swamped
for the rest of the day.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.715
Okay. Well, my flight doesn't
leave until Saturday morning.

11:55.758 --> 11:58.326
You can't be busy all the time.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.893
You're right.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.111
Uh, lunch tomorrow?

12:01.155 --> 12:02.504
Perfect.

12:02.547 --> 12:03.810
Actually,
there's a-a great waffle place

12:03.853 --> 12:04.898
next to where I'm staying.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.334
Okay, first of all, adorable.

12:06.377 --> 12:08.815
Second,
you're staying here now.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.294
I know the owner.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.340
I'll go get my stuff.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.645
Cool.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.782
What?

12:19.826 --> 12:20.957
I thought you were getting
this thing annulled.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.480
I did.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.655
We're just having lunch,
not getting remarried.

12:23.699 --> 12:24.961
Okay.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.355
Just be careful.
You barely know this guy.

12:27.398 --> 12:30.619
Well, from what I gathered
during our marriage,

12:30.662 --> 12:33.753
he's really sweet,
and he has great taste in movies

12:33.796 --> 12:35.276
and in men, obviously.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.060
I just think it's a little weird

12:37.104 --> 12:39.671
that he happens to visit Atlanta
to finalize your annulment.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.412
His flight gets canceled,

12:41.456 --> 12:43.850
then he manages to get
a free room and a date

12:43.893 --> 12:45.025
with a baller businessman.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.200
You think I'm a baller?

12:46.243 --> 12:47.244
That's not the point.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.724
We're just going on a date,

12:48.768 --> 12:50.378
and then he's leaving, okay?

12:50.421 --> 12:51.814
Nothing to worry about.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.642
Mm-hmm.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.644
<i>I have a business proposal
for you.</i>

12:55.687 --> 12:58.516
My sleepwear collection begins
production in three days.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.692
I just need a little help
seeing it through--

13:00.736 --> 13:02.042
an investment.

13:02.085 --> 13:04.305
Even if I wanted to,
which I don't,

13:04.348 --> 13:05.959
my money's tied up right now.

13:06.002 --> 13:08.309
How about I leave
my proposal with you

13:08.352 --> 13:11.007
just in case it gets untied?

13:11.051 --> 13:13.880
Wouldn't want you to miss out
on the next big thing, Brother.

13:13.923 --> 13:17.187
Haven't you milked the
Carrington cow enough already?

13:18.232 --> 13:19.711
That cow is

13:19.755 --> 13:21.757
as much mine to milk
as it is yours.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.150
If not more.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.804
-Meaning what?
-Meaning...

13:24.847 --> 13:26.849
we had the same father,

13:26.893 --> 13:29.591
and you were given all of the
privileges of being a Carrington

13:29.634 --> 13:31.071
that I wasn't.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.681
Years of them.

13:32.724 --> 13:35.249
Even when I came here with
my mom as a little girl,

13:35.292 --> 13:37.381
I wasn't allowed to play
with you and your toys.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.862
Oh, is this about
lost playtime?
No.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.822
It's about, if things were
just a little different,

13:42.865 --> 13:44.824
maybe I would've grown up here,

13:44.867 --> 13:46.738
and you would have been
the bastard child.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.089
Instead, you're just a bastard.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.917
Don't push it, Dom.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.832
I agreed to let you live here
for a year,

13:52.875 --> 13:55.573
but I've been known to change
my mind at a moment's notice.

14:01.362 --> 14:04.365
Since my "something new"
wasn't sentimental,

14:04.408 --> 14:06.802
I think this might
make up for it.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.851
What's all this?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.679
Well...

14:14.723 --> 14:17.204
since your mom won't be
with us for the wedding--

14:17.247 --> 14:19.119
thank you again
for uninviting her--

14:19.162 --> 14:22.252
I figured you might want
your dad there,

14:22.296 --> 14:24.037
in spirit.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.256
And I know your relationship
with him is complicated now,

14:26.300 --> 14:27.910
you know, after the whole

14:27.954 --> 14:31.087
"he got your high school
girlfriend pregnant" revelation,

14:31.131 --> 14:33.829
but I also remember
how much he meant to you.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.919
Yeah, they match
my dad's old pocket square.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.790
-Mm-hmm.
-How did you...?

14:38.834 --> 14:41.532
I stole the photo of him
wearing it from your apartment.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.317
And I had one made for you

14:43.360 --> 14:44.840
and for your groomsmen.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.842
-Fallon, it's perfect.
-Yeah?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.583
Thank you.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.282
Here.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.110
So, your "new" and
"blue" is secured.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.851
Yes, yes.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.027
And I have the perfect idea
for my "something old."

14:58.071 --> 15:01.291
So now all I need
is the "something borrowed,"

15:01.335 --> 15:04.033
which has to be from
a relative's happy marriage

15:04.077 --> 15:06.166
so that their good luck
rubs off on us.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.081
-So, who are you gonna ask?
-That's the issue.

15:08.124 --> 15:11.084
I can't think of anyone
from either of our families

15:11.127 --> 15:12.912
who are happily married,
but, you know,

15:12.955 --> 15:14.609
luckily, we still have time.

15:15.566 --> 15:16.828
Well, now I'm starting
to wonder.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.308
What?

15:18.352 --> 15:20.571
Father Lynch had
an allergic reaction to kiwi.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.443
What kind of a reaction?

15:22.486 --> 15:25.576
Like a blotchy skin
type of reaction

15:25.620 --> 15:27.535
or more of a closed throat deal?

15:27.578 --> 15:30.364
Because I could probably work
-with blotchy skin.
-Fallon.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.018
The man's in the hospital.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.150
Okay, we're just gonna have
to find a new officiant.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.543
Fine,
because I probably couldn't

15:35.586 --> 15:37.675
handle blotchy skin, anyway.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.983
So if Mr. Anders has already
left the refinery,

15:41.027 --> 15:42.550
where is he now?

15:43.768 --> 15:46.119
What do you mean you don't know?
You flew him there, right?

15:46.162 --> 15:48.599
So, did he just get in a car
and leave, or...?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.907
Yeah, well, I don't appreciate <i>
your</i> tone!

15:51.951 --> 15:53.604
Everything okay?

15:53.648 --> 15:55.606
Yeah, everything's fine.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.391
Uh...

15:57.434 --> 15:59.871
well, the tailor seems to have
misplaced my wedding suit.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.569
Ugh, that's so annoying,

16:01.612 --> 16:03.179
and it's probably 'cause
my dad isn't here

16:03.223 --> 16:04.920
organizing everything.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.400
Yeah.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.010
Uh, where is he?

16:08.054 --> 16:09.751
I don't know and
I don't care.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.535
He's been blowing up my phone
all day with messages.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.015
I stopped looking when they
got into the double digits.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.408
Ugh.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.497
That's him again! He's insane!

16:17.585 --> 16:19.717
Why is he acting so crazy?

16:19.761 --> 16:21.632
I bet it's
male menopause.

16:21.676 --> 16:23.069
You know, I heard
a podcast about it.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.592
It's a real thing.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.159
Well, I didn't actually listen
to all the podcast.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.638
I listened to,
like, half of it.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.249
Technically, it was
about a murder in Manitoba,

16:29.292 --> 16:31.164
but I bet you would find it
really interesting, though.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.730
You know, you should
really listen to it.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.080
-It's really interesting.
-Hey.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.560
Hey, um,

16:36.604 --> 16:38.040
I need to make a private call.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.259
Um, could we do this later?

16:39.302 --> 16:40.521
Right now?
Right now.

16:40.564 --> 16:41.957
Aw.
Come on, please.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.177
-Oh, there you go.
-Okay.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.048
Thanks.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.964
Hey.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.183
How soon can you get someone
to Billings, Montana?

16:56.493 --> 16:58.626
Uh, hello, Eric.
It's, um, Blake Carrington.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.454
I was hoping for an update.

17:00.497 --> 17:01.977
Give me a call.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.675
Uh, quick question.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.765
Has anyone in our family
ever had a happy marriage?

17:09.419 --> 17:12.118
Well, not what I was expecting,
but, uh...

17:12.161 --> 17:14.076
My "something borrowed"
needs to be

17:14.120 --> 17:17.253
from a happy,
lasting relationship.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.299
Well, I think
your great-grandfather

17:19.342 --> 17:20.909
and his third wife
were pretty solid--

17:20.952 --> 17:22.606
well, until he met
his fourth wife, I guess.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.086
This is worse than I thought.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.305
Is this that important to you?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.133
I just...

17:27.176 --> 17:30.397
I really want things
to work out with Liam,

17:30.440 --> 17:33.965
so I can't take any chances,
as crazy as that sounds.

17:34.009 --> 17:35.271
Hold on.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.578
You know,
when two people are soul mates,

17:37.621 --> 17:39.362
like you and Liam,

17:39.406 --> 17:42.496
they do whatever it takes
to make it work.

17:43.845 --> 17:47.066
This is from my wedding with
Cristal when I was in prison.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.981
I saved it as a reminder

17:50.025 --> 17:52.375
that we can weather
anything together.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.986
And now you can borrow it,
for lasting good luck.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.771
Didn't Cristal just move out?

17:56.814 --> 17:58.773
Well, marriage isn't always
picture-perfect.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.818
You'll find that out
pretty quickly.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.648
Well, I'm glad we could
make this happen.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.346
I love it when fate
works in our favor.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.478
Fate and
a canceled flight.
Mm.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.741
Did the airline even give you
an explanation for that?

18:10.785 --> 18:12.743
I mean, the skies yesterday
were as clear as

18:12.787 --> 18:14.745
Gwyneth's skin
after a sage facial.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.443
Uh...

18:16.486 --> 18:18.967
Well, uh, technically,
it actually wasn't canceled.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.969
I was bumped
out of my seat, um...

18:21.012 --> 18:22.840
It's what you get
for trying to save money

18:22.884 --> 18:24.451
-and fly standby.
-Wait, they bumped you,

18:24.494 --> 18:26.322
and they didn't even
put you on the next flight?

18:26.366 --> 18:27.889
Weird, right?

18:27.932 --> 18:30.457
I-I had this whole
dramatic speech prepared,

18:30.500 --> 18:32.198
but by the time
I got to the front

18:32.241 --> 18:34.852
of the customer service line,
I just-- I couldn't do it.

18:35.853 --> 18:39.248
My mom worked a ton of customer
service gigs back in Ohio

18:39.292 --> 18:40.858
to support
the two of us.

18:40.902 --> 18:43.948
And I'm talking about my mom.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.690
Smooth, Ryan.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.910
Not smooth.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.825
But pretty sweet.

18:50.868 --> 18:54.307
You know, most of my childhood
was just me and my mom, too.

18:54.350 --> 18:55.743
So...

18:55.786 --> 18:57.701
I don't know who I'd be
without her.

18:59.399 --> 19:02.532
Turns out a Venezuelan
and a Midwesterner

19:02.576 --> 19:05.144
can have more in common
than an appreciation

19:05.187 --> 19:06.884
for classy linens.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.192
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.020
No, no, no, it's my fault.

19:12.063 --> 19:15.023
Uh, you know what, I didn't even
love that drink anyway, so...

19:15.066 --> 19:16.416
You see?

19:16.459 --> 19:17.678
Fate.

19:21.595 --> 19:24.250
There's the blushing bride.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.034
I've been looking
all over for you.

19:26.077 --> 19:29.385
By lurking in the shadows
of a room no one ever goes into?

19:29.429 --> 19:33.650
I know, when planning a wedding,
the bride so often overlooks

19:33.694 --> 19:35.913
what she's wearing
when the dress comes off.

19:35.957 --> 19:38.133
-Mm-hmm.
-So I'm gifting you sleepwear

19:38.177 --> 19:39.569
from my exclusive collection.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.092
Aw.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.182
Maybe just stick
-to the registry.
-Oh, I promise.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.836
One night in Doma-sleek,
and you'll understand.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.491
And as another wedding present,
I'm giving you the chance

19:48.535 --> 19:50.363
to get in on the ground floor
as an investor.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.408
Oh, thank you,
but Fallon Unlimited

19:52.452 --> 19:54.628
isn't exactly
in the pajama game.

19:54.671 --> 19:55.977
Sleepwear.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.457
And I was thinking

19:57.500 --> 20:00.416
this would be
less a business matter

20:00.460 --> 20:01.809
and more of
a family thing.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.551
Well, that's exactly
why I can't help.

20:04.594 --> 20:07.249
I need to focus
on my family.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.555
You mean "our family."

20:09.643 --> 20:12.907
That pricey heirloom
belonged to my Aunt Lilly.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.604
No, that's just
my "something old."

20:14.648 --> 20:15.997
I was talking
about Liam

20:16.040 --> 20:17.433
and our rehearsal dinner,

20:17.477 --> 20:19.000
which actually starts
in a few hours,

20:19.043 --> 20:20.871
so good luck with your nighties.

20:22.656 --> 20:25.572
Is Jeff going to be there
tonight?

20:26.573 --> 20:28.923
Well, unless things
suddenly became normal,

20:28.966 --> 20:31.230
he's still my mother's plus one.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.887
Look, this isn't
about loyalty, Blake.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.541
Carrington Atlantic
simply doesn't have

20:38.585 --> 20:40.717
the necessary collateral
to cover a loan this size.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.371
As a 48-hour bridge loan,

20:42.415 --> 20:44.155
you'll have your money back
before the ink is dry.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.767
I need to cover these contracts,
or else my company's done.

20:46.810 --> 20:49.204
Which is why, as an old friend,

20:49.248 --> 20:50.901
I came up with an
alternative option.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.904
See, Carrington Atlantic may
not have enough collateral,

20:53.948 --> 20:55.906
but Blake Carrington does.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.127
You want me to stake
my personal assets?

20:59.170 --> 21:00.868
If your plan is
as airtight as you say,

21:00.911 --> 21:02.391
it doesn't matter where
the collateral's coming from.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.219
Right? Oh, boy.

21:05.568 --> 21:08.441
Yeah, I appreciate
the offer, Eric,

21:08.484 --> 21:11.182
but I think that I will explore
all my options.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.620
Well, look it over,
but don't think too long,

21:13.663 --> 21:16.144
or you'll miss your window
to fulfill those contracts.

21:29.070 --> 21:31.028
-You're welcome.
-Uh...

21:31.072 --> 21:32.552
For what?

21:32.595 --> 21:34.641
A horse with
an ass full of diamonds?

21:34.684 --> 21:36.425
That is your
"something borrowed."

21:36.469 --> 21:38.209
It is a Dala horse.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.168
It's a Swedish symbol
for good luck.

21:40.211 --> 21:41.996
Jeff bought it for me
on our wedding day.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.780
Uh, that's lovely, thank you,

21:43.824 --> 21:45.304
but I need to
borrow something

21:45.347 --> 21:47.044
from a couple's
happy marriage,

21:47.088 --> 21:48.394
not a duplicitous sham.

21:48.437 --> 21:49.699
Plus, Blake gave me
his boutonniere

21:49.743 --> 21:51.353
from his wedding with Cristal.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.529
The only happy marriage
Blake has is with Scotch.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.009
And yes,
my marriage to Jeff

21:55.052 --> 21:56.663
started off as strategic,

21:56.706 --> 21:59.361
but it's grown into
something more... intimate.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.363
No. I do-- I don't want to know.

22:01.407 --> 22:03.147
I only want what's best
for you and Liam.

22:03.191 --> 22:04.888
Is that so wrong?

22:08.762 --> 22:12.505
When you married my dad,

22:12.548 --> 22:14.333
did you believe
you were gonna be

22:14.376 --> 22:16.291
-together forever?
-Of course.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.598
We were just like
any other newlyweds.

22:18.641 --> 22:21.165
But sometimes
things don't work out.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.080
Oh. That's comforting to know.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.432
But sometimes they do.

22:26.475 --> 22:29.348
I think I have found
my version of a true partner,

22:29.391 --> 22:32.960
and you are about
to marry yours.

22:33.003 --> 22:36.877
So, yes, sometimes
the universe does get it right.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.489
And this, more than some

22:40.533 --> 22:43.100
dead flower
from Blake's incarceration,

22:43.144 --> 22:45.712
will help push it
over the finish line.

22:54.242 --> 22:55.939
Shelly Duncan?

22:55.983 --> 22:57.376
Yes?

22:57.419 --> 22:59.116
I'm an old friend
of the Harrison family.

22:59.160 --> 23:02.468
I believe that you worked as
her caregiver some years ago.

23:02.511 --> 23:05.209
-I can't really talk about that.
-No, no, I understand that.

23:05.253 --> 23:06.689
But, look, I just have
a couple of questions

23:06.733 --> 23:08.038
about her unfortunate overdose.

23:08.082 --> 23:09.866
The police report was unhelpful.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.825
I wasn't there when she died.

23:11.868 --> 23:14.567
Her son Mike-- well,
I guess he goes by Adam now--

23:14.610 --> 23:16.264
he sent me home
early that day.

23:16.307 --> 23:17.831
And I really don't
want any trouble.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.267
Oh, neither do I.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.877
Look, the truth is,

23:20.921 --> 23:22.401
I'm not really a friend
of the Harrisons,

23:22.444 --> 23:23.967
but I do know Adam,

23:24.011 --> 23:26.187
and I'm afraid he
might be dangerous.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.755
I suspect you may share
my concern.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.583
Ms. Duncan, please.

23:30.626 --> 23:33.455
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't an emergency.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.414
He's dating my daughter.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.852
Come inside.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.201
Thanks.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.688
-Good news. Melinda
found a new officiant,

23:48.731 --> 23:50.298
and he just confirmed
for tomorrow.

23:50.341 --> 23:52.909
Oh, thank the folklore gods.

23:52.953 --> 23:54.607
I told her to have him
stop by tonight,

23:54.650 --> 23:56.870
get to know us before he
binds us together for eternity.

23:56.913 --> 23:59.916
Well, you don't have to say it
like it's a prison sentence.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.570
Ooh. Is this our
"something new"?

24:01.614 --> 24:03.224
Yes. Yes.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.922
Sam wouldn't let me drive
the actual car into the lobby.

24:05.966 --> 24:07.924
Liability. Total buzzkill.

24:07.968 --> 24:10.623
Oh, speaking of kill,
Alexis is going to kill me

24:10.666 --> 24:12.625
when she finds out
I chose Blake's boutonniere

24:12.668 --> 24:14.278
over her bedazzled horse.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.063
Yeah, well, I'm sure
she'll be good after a glass

24:16.106 --> 24:17.717
or three of rosé.
Mm.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.197
You ready?

24:20.241 --> 24:21.590
Beyond ready.

24:21.634 --> 24:22.896
Let's get this party started.

24:24.027 --> 24:25.376
Hey, I just need
to go find Blake

24:25.420 --> 24:26.813
and talk to him
-for a minute.
-Okay.

24:26.856 --> 24:27.901
I'll come find you.

24:27.944 --> 24:29.424
Please.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.599
I can't get through
this night on my own.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.386
Aw, you two are so cute.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.997
I don't want to hear it.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.652
I was just gonna say
it's nice to see you happy.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.349
Even if it is with Adam.

24:41.392 --> 24:42.829
Funny. But thank you.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.483
I wish everyone else
felt the same way.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.573
My father's convinced
Adam is pure evil.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.836
I'm sure your dad is just
looking out for you.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.707
By punishing Adam in the present

24:51.751 --> 24:54.144
for things that might or might
not have happened in the past?

24:54.188 --> 24:55.537
It's not fair.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.104
I should know.
I've been dealing with

24:57.147 --> 24:58.540
this exact thing my whole life.

24:58.584 --> 25:01.195
I guess I hadn't thought
about it like that.

25:01.238 --> 25:03.676
Despite my reputation,
you never called me crazy,

25:03.719 --> 25:04.851
and I appreciated that.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.243
You gave me a real chance

25:06.287 --> 25:07.549
and saw me for who I was.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.203
And look where

25:09.246 --> 25:11.248
talking to one ex
about her new boyfriend,

25:11.292 --> 25:13.294
while my other ex is hosting
her rehearsal dinner

25:13.337 --> 25:14.861
across the room.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.558
Yeah, well, maybe
you shouldn't sleep with

25:16.602 --> 25:18.691
anyone else in the manor
for a while. That could help.

25:18.734 --> 25:22.303
But, seriously, thanks for
being one of the good ones

25:22.346 --> 25:23.913
and giving people
the benefit of the doubt.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.747
Yes, yes, I usually do
bank with Skadden,

25:31.791 --> 25:33.793
but now I'm calling you.

25:33.836 --> 25:36.099
It'd be 18 hours.

25:37.884 --> 25:39.625
Fine.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.718
-What's wrong?
-Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

25:45.761 --> 25:47.894
I'm excited to have a night
with just family.

25:47.937 --> 25:49.896
No business,
like we discussed.

25:49.939 --> 25:51.550
You look beautiful.

25:51.593 --> 25:52.942
Thank you.

25:54.074 --> 25:55.597
Is that boutonniere
really from our wedding?

25:55.641 --> 25:57.251
Yes, it is.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.861
Now it's Fallon's "something
borrowed," for good luck.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.037
Oh, I can't believe
it survived prison.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.343
I can't believe
I survived prison.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.214
But I did-- we did.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.173
That's why I wanted her
to have it.

26:06.216 --> 26:07.609
Our love is like
that boutonniere.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.306
It'll survive anything.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.613
It certainly feels like
we've been to hell and back.

26:11.657 --> 26:12.832
But we're back, right?

26:15.182 --> 26:17.488
Hey. Looks like we could both
use a refresh.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.320
The extra case of bubbly
is on its way.

26:23.364 --> 26:24.757
Everything else in order?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.759
Yeah. And we just
got the extra ice.

26:26.802 --> 26:27.977
Okay. So, for
the next few hours,

26:28.021 --> 26:30.327
I'm Sam-the-guest,
not Sam-the-boss.

26:30.371 --> 26:31.938
All questions go to Britt.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.635
So, how was lunch?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.855
It went really well.

26:35.898 --> 26:38.335
I think he might
just be a normal guy

26:38.379 --> 26:40.424
with incredible abs,
stripping his way to law school.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.078
I'm sorry I said anything.

26:42.122 --> 26:44.646
Look, I know you were just
worried for me.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.387
And the situation
started looking

26:46.430 --> 26:48.607
less like <i>Pretty Woman
and more like Parasite.</i>

26:48.650 --> 26:50.739
I even put a call
into the airline

26:50.783 --> 26:52.306
before lunch to check his story.

26:52.349 --> 26:55.091
But Ryan and I are gonna
sneak in breakfast tomorrow,

26:55.135 --> 26:57.137
and, uh, we'll go from there.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.878
Well, I'm
happy for you.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.014
Seriously, Dominique?

27:05.058 --> 27:07.538
Hi, sweetheart.

27:07.582 --> 27:09.628
I'd tell you
I called multiple times,

27:09.671 --> 27:11.891
but I'm pretty sure
you know that already.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.849
Why are you ignoring me?

27:13.893 --> 27:15.459
Because if you call
more than once,

27:15.503 --> 27:16.852
it's usually for a handout.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.941
I was calling to check
on your health.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.508
-Mm.
-That's what mothers do.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.031
Though now that you mention it,

27:22.075 --> 27:24.468
I do have a great
business opportunity for you.

27:24.512 --> 27:25.905
I have other priorities.

27:25.948 --> 27:28.559
I deserve to be a priority, too.

27:28.603 --> 27:30.866
Oh, I think
you've got that covered.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.781
Even as a mother, you
always put yourself first,

27:32.825 --> 27:34.478
and that will
never change.

27:34.522 --> 27:37.394
You are the only family
you've ever needed.

27:53.193 --> 27:55.282
Is the microphone
really necessary?
Yes.

27:55.325 --> 27:56.675
We need to make sure that

27:56.718 --> 27:58.067
our good luck toast is
heard loud and clear.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.155
-Just stick to the plan.
Okay. All right.

27:59.199 --> 28:00.417
-Whoa.
You got it.

28:00.461 --> 28:01.810
All right. Hey there.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.551
Uh, thank you all
for coming tonight

28:03.594 --> 28:04.726
to, uh,
help us celebrate.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.162
Yes, thank you.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.555
And sure,

28:07.598 --> 28:09.600
everything's been
a little crazy lately,

28:09.644 --> 28:11.690
but we wanted to thank you
for reminding us

28:11.733 --> 28:14.257
that true love
has many phases.

28:14.301 --> 28:17.043
Yes. So here is to a new,

28:17.086 --> 28:20.002
drama-free yet
blissful chapter.

28:28.097 --> 28:30.273
Oh, dear.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.319
Sorry I'm late.

28:32.362 --> 28:34.364
Did I miss the first course?

28:47.029 --> 28:48.552
What the hell
are you doing here?

28:48.596 --> 28:50.076
I banned you
from the wedding.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.860
You see, most people
would realize

28:51.904 --> 28:53.819
that includes
-the rehearsal dinner.
-I know,

28:53.862 --> 28:55.821
and I'm very sorry
about ruining your picture,

28:55.864 --> 28:57.561
but that wasn't really

28:57.605 --> 28:58.911
your best look.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.739
Honey, I just needed
to talk to you.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.436
Yeah, no, Mom, see,
you lost that privilege

29:02.479 --> 29:04.177
after lying about
my half-brother,

29:04.220 --> 29:06.092
almost getting us killed
in Moldavia,

29:06.135 --> 29:07.963
and trying to sabotage
my relationship with Fallon.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.791
God ...ltiple times.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.445
Liam, you're just pointing out
every little flaw.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.534
Look, if you refuse
to leave on your own,

29:13.577 --> 29:15.014
I'll just get someone
-to help you go.
-No.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.580
Liam...

29:19.018 --> 29:20.236
I hate to say it...

29:20.280 --> 29:21.672
And yet I'm still pretty sure

29:21.716 --> 29:23.413
you're gonna say
whatever "it" is.

29:23.457 --> 29:25.285
Perhaps you want to rethink
this "something borrowed."

29:25.328 --> 29:27.896
I'm sure somebody could get the
horse sculpture from the manor

29:27.940 --> 29:30.203
before this entire hotel
collapses on everyone.

29:30.246 --> 29:32.596
Well, actually,
your horse is here.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.294
Yeah. It's in
Sam's office.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.035
I brought it as a backup,
just in case.

29:36.078 --> 29:38.515
At least you did
one thing right.

29:38.559 --> 29:40.126
Oh, my God.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.218
Fallon, wait.

29:45.261 --> 29:47.263
I come in peace.

29:47.307 --> 29:49.439
Great. Can you leave in peace?

29:49.483 --> 29:52.138
I've been thinking a lot
about my behavior lately.

29:52.181 --> 29:53.879
And I realize now that,

29:53.922 --> 29:56.925
in trying to keep my son close,
I just pushed him away

29:56.969 --> 29:58.579
and I just hurt the girl
that he loves.

29:58.622 --> 30:01.190
You're just reversing
the plot of <i>The Notebook.</i>

30:01.234 --> 30:02.583
Well, maybe
you won't forgive me.

30:02.626 --> 30:06.239
But I don't want to miss
my son's special day

30:06.282 --> 30:08.328
just because I didn't try
to make things right.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.678
It's time to go, Mother.

30:10.721 --> 30:11.810
Okay.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.988
Hey. Hey. Just...

30:16.031 --> 30:17.641
Don't kill me,

30:17.685 --> 30:19.643
but I think you should
hear your mother out.

30:21.558 --> 30:22.821
Are you serious?
Yes.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.648
If brokering peace

30:24.692 --> 30:27.390
could help avoid
stirring up future drama,

30:27.434 --> 30:29.088
then, yeah,
I think it's worth a shot.

30:29.131 --> 30:31.394
Plus, I-I think
she might,

30:31.438 --> 30:33.135
you know, be
sincere this time.

30:33.179 --> 30:35.834
Although I've been wrong before.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.229
Okay.

30:45.408 --> 30:46.670
Whoa, whoa.

30:48.455 --> 30:49.804
Where you running off to?

30:49.848 --> 30:52.067
Oh, just trying to escape
all of the drama.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.722
Tonight was supposed to be about
family getting along, not...

30:54.765 --> 30:57.986
What is that?

30:58.030 --> 31:00.162
Why is your bag ringing?

31:00.206 --> 31:01.816
I can explain.

31:05.211 --> 31:06.865
You don't get
what you need

31:06.908 --> 31:09.563
from me, so you just take
the first thing you can find?

31:09.606 --> 31:12.218
That clock belongs to me
as much as it belongs to Fallon.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.915
I don't care about
the stupid clock.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.786
I just want to know what
you could possibly be thinking.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.788
What was your plan here?
Sell the clock online

31:17.832 --> 31:19.138
for hundreds
of thousands of dollars

31:19.181 --> 31:20.313
and just hope
no one noticed?

31:20.356 --> 31:22.010
There wasn't a plan.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.359
But after getting knocked down
one too many times,

31:23.403 --> 31:24.360
Dominique fights back.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.145
That clock alone

31:26.188 --> 31:28.843
covers what I need
to keep my life afloat.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.758
They don't deserve it.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.412
No, they don't.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.153
But this is not the way
to save your company.

31:34.196 --> 31:37.286
Though I will help you
save your dignity.

31:37.330 --> 31:38.592
Return the clock.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.598
Did you find him?

31:44.641 --> 31:46.426
I located
and tailed your target.

31:46.469 --> 31:49.081
After visiting Dr. Holtzman
at Saint Mary's hospital,

31:49.124 --> 31:52.127
he visited the home
-of Shelly Duncan.
-The nurse?

31:52.171 --> 31:56.088
Yes. And she must have had
something interesting to say.

31:56.131 --> 31:59.004
Anders was there
for almost two hours.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.485
Is there anything else
you need from me?

32:02.529 --> 32:05.097
No-no, that's-that's fine.
Thank you.

32:10.754 --> 32:13.105
My, you certainly have
an eye for detail.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.107
Uh, detail, yes.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.544
Good luck charms, not so much.

32:17.587 --> 32:18.980
Hopefully,
this one works.

32:19.024 --> 32:21.461
I'm sorry,
what are you doing here?

32:21.504 --> 32:24.855
Honestly?
I don't really know anymore.

32:27.162 --> 32:29.164
Um, whatever you said
must have worked,

32:29.208 --> 32:31.993
because your runaway
groom has returned.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.604
Hmm. Apparently, all it takes
is a little self-restraint

32:34.648 --> 32:36.606
and a tacky
"something borrowed"

32:36.650 --> 32:38.173
to restore balance.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.870
Yeah, everyone does
seem super chill.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.437
And we're still
on schedule.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.309
Oh, yes, and I'd like
to keep it that way.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.267
Okay, bridal party speeches now.
Just stick to the script, okay?

32:45.311 --> 32:46.399
Okay.
Okay.

32:46.442 --> 32:47.748
Liam.

32:50.881 --> 32:53.406
-Uh, what's he doing here?
-Who?

32:53.449 --> 32:56.887
Him.
-Oh, that's our
new officiant.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.672
Well, if you want to keep things
chill and balanced,

32:58.715 --> 33:00.326
I'd rethink that choice.

33:00.369 --> 33:02.110
-Why?
-Because I'm pretty sure
that's the priest

33:02.154 --> 33:04.025
Cristal's been sleeping with.

33:08.203 --> 33:09.988
Is that true?

33:10.031 --> 33:11.380
What are you doing here?

33:11.424 --> 33:12.729
Hmm. I didn't know
you'd be here.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.470
Um, isn't this
the Van Kirk wedding?

33:14.514 --> 33:16.081
Yes. Yes, it is.

33:16.124 --> 33:17.691
Hey, that's the guy
that was at our house.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.214
Can we discuss this
somewhere else?

33:19.258 --> 33:20.259
What, you want
to humiliate me in public

33:20.302 --> 33:21.521
but apologize in private?

33:21.564 --> 33:22.870
I'm not apologizing.

33:22.913 --> 33:24.219
You slept with a priest!

33:24.263 --> 33:25.438
What is it gonna take
to get an "I'm sorry"?

33:25.481 --> 33:26.700
What about you?

33:26.743 --> 33:28.310
Sleeping with Laura Van Kirk?

33:28.354 --> 33:29.877
Oh, come on.
Oh, gross.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.661
Sounds vaguely familiar.

33:31.705 --> 33:33.098
Oh, vaguely familiar?

33:33.141 --> 33:35.535
It's like a train crash

33:35.578 --> 33:37.493
that keeps going

33:37.537 --> 33:40.018
into the ocean
until it hits an iceberg

33:40.061 --> 33:41.367
and then another train.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.455
I slept with my husband.

33:42.498 --> 33:43.673
And then the <i>Titanic.</i>

33:43.717 --> 33:44.935
No one cares, Alexis!

33:44.979 --> 33:46.328
Hey, don't speak
to my wife like that.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.504
You slept with
Liam's mother.

33:48.548 --> 33:49.723
Are you that desperate?

33:49.766 --> 33:51.551
It was just sex. Get over it.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.118
Okay, everybody, please.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.294
If we just calm down,

33:55.337 --> 33:56.947
I'm sure we can
talk through this.

33:56.991 --> 33:58.862
Yeah, I'm done talking.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.168
No, no, no, no.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.084
Enough!

34:03.128 --> 34:04.477
Everyone,

34:04.520 --> 34:07.088
enjoy the party, without me.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.916
Because I'm going home.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.877
-Fallon.
-No.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.362
You slept with a priest?!

34:20.406 --> 34:22.799
You slept with
your daughter's mother-in-law.

34:22.843 --> 34:24.584
It was a one-time mistake
and it meant nothing.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.281
-Can you say the same thing?
-You stepped out of our marriage

34:26.325 --> 34:27.804
and then lied about it.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.458
Isn't that exactly what you did?

34:29.502 --> 34:31.330
Go ahead, answer it.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.897
Forget Laura Van Kirk. That's
your real mistress calling.

34:33.941 --> 34:35.247
Carrington Atlantic.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.337
We both made mistakes.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.425
You need to take
some responsibility.

34:39.468 --> 34:41.209
I know what I did was wrong!

34:42.558 --> 34:44.517
But I never meant to hurt you.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.475
I also thought

34:46.519 --> 34:49.087
I married a man who would
choose to save his marriage

34:49.130 --> 34:50.566
before his company.

34:53.178 --> 34:55.049
I'm sorry I took you
for granted.

35:01.882 --> 35:06.495
But I promise you that we are
my number one priority now.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.280
How am I supposed
to believe you?

35:08.323 --> 35:10.108
Same way that I was
supposed to believe you.

35:11.631 --> 35:13.328
We both need to do the hard work

35:13.372 --> 35:15.896
and commit to rebuilding
our trust in one another.

35:15.939 --> 35:17.550
Come home.

35:18.594 --> 35:21.597
I want to find our way back.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.338
But it's gonna take
more than just living together

35:23.382 --> 35:24.861
to make things right.

35:26.211 --> 35:29.257
We both just need time
to process.

35:29.301 --> 35:32.695
And then, after Fallon's
wedding, we can...

35:32.739 --> 35:34.915
we can figure out
how to move forward.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.438
Okay.

35:37.483 --> 35:38.788
So you're saying the airline

35:38.832 --> 35:40.877
didn't bump my client
from the flight?

35:40.921 --> 35:42.575
He canceled it himself.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.620
Okay, uh, but he's still booked

35:44.664 --> 35:47.232
on the one
tomorrow morning, right?

35:47.275 --> 35:49.669
What?

35:49.712 --> 35:51.714
Are you sure?

35:51.758 --> 35:53.586
There you are.

35:53.629 --> 35:56.415
You missed quite the show
at dinner.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.200
Where you going?

35:59.244 --> 36:00.636
What's happening here?

36:00.680 --> 36:02.377
Hello?

36:02.421 --> 36:04.118
Talk to me.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.513
You want me to talk to you?

36:08.862 --> 36:12.213
What if I said that I did
push Alexis into the fire?

36:13.693 --> 36:16.261
What if I said
that I was responsible

36:16.304 --> 36:18.872
for my mother's death
in Montana?

36:20.526 --> 36:22.745
And what if your father
knows all about this

36:22.789 --> 36:24.921
and he's trying
to make me pay?

36:24.965 --> 36:27.489
So that fire story's true?

36:27.533 --> 36:30.013
And what do you mean
you were responsible

36:30.057 --> 36:31.363
for your other mother's death?

36:31.406 --> 36:33.713
I made her O.D.

36:33.756 --> 36:37.195
And I can blame it
on my abusive childhood

36:37.238 --> 36:38.935
or her addiction, but...

36:38.979 --> 36:41.199
doesn't change
what I did.

36:44.985 --> 36:47.248
I didn't want to tell you
because I didn't want you

36:47.292 --> 36:49.337
to think of me as a monster.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.605
I don't think
you're a monster.

36:57.693 --> 37:00.783
You're not the only one
with secrets in their past.

37:11.054 --> 37:13.796
Thought you lost your key.

37:13.840 --> 37:18.975
I did, but I know how you love
a good gnome hide-a-key, Mom.

37:20.499 --> 37:23.284
How long has it been? A year?

37:23.328 --> 37:26.722
Since I found out
Thomas Carrington was my father?

37:26.766 --> 37:28.158
I think so.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.160
I was talking about
your last visit,

37:30.204 --> 37:32.337
but if you're here
to give me sass, you can just...

37:32.380 --> 37:34.382
I'm here to apologize.

37:34.426 --> 37:36.558
I know I hurt you.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.518
Just like I hurt my kids.

37:39.561 --> 37:42.347
I guess it takes losing
your family before you realize

37:42.390 --> 37:44.349
what they
mean to you.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.176
Although, after finding out
about Thomas,

37:46.220 --> 37:48.744
I'm not sure
who that family is or who I am.

37:48.788 --> 37:51.094
Do you think you're the only one

37:51.138 --> 37:53.575
dealing with
our complicated history?

37:53.619 --> 37:55.838
I loved Thomas.

37:55.882 --> 37:58.972
But I had to protect you
from the Carrington backlash.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.843
So I walked away.

38:02.454 --> 38:05.587
I never thought about
how painful this was for you.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.198
I'm sorry.

38:08.242 --> 38:10.244
You're my mom.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.377
I don't want
to lose you.

38:12.420 --> 38:16.424
I'd like to start over,
if possible.

38:24.432 --> 38:26.826
This opens a safe deposit box.

38:26.869 --> 38:30.220
Thomas's lawyer gave it to me
after he died to give to you.

38:30.264 --> 38:32.484
I tried, but you never
returned my calls.

38:32.527 --> 38:33.963
What is it?

38:34.007 --> 38:36.314
No idea.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.533
Maybe it'll help you heal.

38:39.491 --> 38:42.276
But let me be clear.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.583
Doesn't matter
what prize is in that box.

38:44.626 --> 38:47.673
It's up to you to mend
your relationship

38:47.716 --> 38:50.023
with me and your children.

38:52.939 --> 38:55.202
I just sent
the final signed contract,

38:55.245 --> 38:58.161
putting up my personal assets
as collateral.

38:58.205 --> 39:00.860
I'll process everything now.

39:00.903 --> 39:02.296
Thank you, Eric.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.429
-I appreciate it.
-Anytime, Blake.

39:08.433 --> 39:11.871
Wow. I never thought
he'd actually do it.

39:11.914 --> 39:14.177
Mm, but when it comes
to logic versus ego,

39:14.221 --> 39:16.266
Blake's ego will always win out.

39:16.310 --> 39:21.402
Well, Blake's ego just leveraged
all his personal assets.

39:21.446 --> 39:24.492
And Eric's logic
just sold us the loan.

39:27.669 --> 39:30.455
And I always thought
-banking was boring.
-Hmm.

39:37.723 --> 39:40.029
Hey.

39:41.944 --> 39:43.729
Sorry tonight was such a fail.

39:45.165 --> 39:47.210
I know I probably overreacted.

39:49.561 --> 39:52.128
I think that was a perfectly
reasonable reaction.

39:52.172 --> 39:54.653
Things went sideways.
That's life.

39:54.696 --> 39:56.437
Life is messy sometimes.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.570
Yeah, but it seems like
it's always messy for me.

39:58.613 --> 40:00.920
I mean, I couldn't even
borrow good luck.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.225
Come on.

40:02.269 --> 40:03.488
Fallon, we both know

40:03.531 --> 40:05.968
that folklore
stuff isn't real.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.927
We can still have
the perfect wedding.

40:07.970 --> 40:10.364
Yeah, but it was never about
having the perfect wedding.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.061
It was about having
the perfect life.

40:12.105 --> 40:14.412
And the closer we get
to the wedding,

40:14.455 --> 40:16.849
the more I'm nervous
that I'm incapable of having

40:16.892 --> 40:18.459
a healthy relationship.

40:18.503 --> 40:21.462
Okay, well, I've been
doing some thinking, too.

40:21.506 --> 40:25.292
And after that dinner, I'm
convinced now, more than ever,

40:25.335 --> 40:27.816
that nothing can stop us
from a happy life.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.427
Were we at the same dinner?

40:30.950 --> 40:34.083
Tonight, like every other
crazy moment we had,

40:34.127 --> 40:37.304
it just... just proves
how strong we are.

40:37.347 --> 40:40.786
And in case we ever
need a reminder...

40:48.228 --> 40:50.360
Hmm.

40:50.404 --> 40:53.625
The Holden,
Wolf and Stone Lounge,

40:53.668 --> 40:55.409
Tiny Trouble Bar.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.499
Wait, are these...?

40:58.543 --> 41:00.501
Napkins from every date
we've been on.

41:00.545 --> 41:03.243
-Wait, you kept all these?
-Of course I did.

41:03.286 --> 41:05.027
We don't need
to borrow something from

41:05.071 --> 41:08.291
a lucky couple in love because
we are that lucky couple.

41:08.335 --> 41:11.120
And we are prepared to clean up
any of life's messes.

41:12.513 --> 41:13.949
Literally.

41:17.866 --> 41:20.478
So, you still want
to marry me tomorrow?

41:21.653 --> 41:24.525
Not only do I want to marry you,

41:24.569 --> 41:27.659
but I want to be with you
every day after that.

41:27.702 --> 41:30.792
And I promise you
that no one and nothing

41:30.836 --> 41:32.794
will ever tear us apart.

41:32.838 --> 41:35.971
I'm sorry I couldn't fix the
water damage for that wedding.

41:36.015 --> 41:38.931
Although I heard their officiant
was hospitalized anyway.

41:38.974 --> 41:40.672
Luckily it all worked out.

41:40.715 --> 41:42.195
What do you mean?

41:42.238 --> 41:44.327
The family moved the ceremony
to their estate,

41:44.371 --> 41:47.330
and, you know, anyone can be
an officiant these days.

41:47.374 --> 41:49.594
The wedding is on.

41:49.637 --> 41:51.552
Oh, great.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.162
Glad it worked out.

41:53.206 --> 41:55.034
I'm sure nothing else
will go wrong.
