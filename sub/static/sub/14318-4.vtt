00:01.875 --> 00:03.250
[narrator]
Previously onX-Men...

00:04.833 --> 00:06.875
[Magneto]
The humans must be crushed.

00:13.583 --> 00:15.416
[Beast] Magneto, I presume.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.000
What are you waiting for?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.416
My day in court, actually.

00:19.416 --> 00:21.333
[growling]

00:21.333 --> 00:22.875
You know that lunatic?

00:22.875 --> 00:24.250
[yelling]

00:27.291 --> 00:28.708
Come on!
They're gonna kill him!

00:29.375 --> 00:30.583
Good.

00:30.583 --> 00:31.750
[Cyclops on PA] Emergency!

00:31.750 --> 00:33.125
Prepare infirmary to receive

00:33.125 --> 00:34.083
critically injured mutant!

00:36.083 --> 00:37.875
These things have
armed themselves!

00:43.125 --> 00:45.083
[Cyclops]
She's going to blow up
those missiles herself!

00:45.250 --> 00:47.875
[Jubilee]
Something about him
reminds me of Wolverine.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.208
[Cyclops]
His name's Sabretooth.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.875
Wolverine knows him
and hates him.

00:51.875 --> 00:54.583
-[Xavier] Did he give a reason?
-[Cyclops] Does he ever?

00:55.875 --> 00:59.458
Wolverine!
Back off. Slow and easy.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.833
[theme music playing]

02:01.250 --> 02:03.125
-[screaming]
-[Xavier, telepathically]
Is there no limit

02:03.125 --> 02:05.625
to the torment
in your mind, Sabretooth?

02:05.625 --> 02:10.125
Have you only known
betrayal by your friends
and persecution by humanity?

02:10.750 --> 02:12.875
We must probe deeper.

02:12.875 --> 02:16.291
Your mind is full
of torment, Sabretooth.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.375
Your mutant life
has been difficult.

02:18.375 --> 02:21.833
Your search for acceptance,
a failure.

02:21.833 --> 02:23.583
[people laughing]

02:24.458 --> 02:28.583
Cruelty to creatures we don't
understand seems limitless.

02:28.583 --> 02:29.958
[roaring]

02:30.833 --> 02:33.291
Let me become
one with your pain.

02:34.208 --> 02:37.750
Together, we can find
the cause of your torment.

02:38.708 --> 02:41.583
What are these inner
demons that drive you?

02:44.291 --> 02:46.708
Yes, we can fight
them together.

02:47.708 --> 02:52.125
Are we any closer
to the core of your rages?

02:59.708 --> 03:02.208
Wait! Don't break
our psychic link!

03:03.416 --> 03:05.166
[Sabretooth growling]

03:05.166 --> 03:08.083
What are you hiding
from me, Sabretooth?

03:08.083 --> 03:10.708
Why do you keep
these thoughts from me?

03:10.708 --> 03:12.833
Can they be so painful?

03:12.833 --> 03:15.875
Don't resist me.
I will know it all in time.

03:16.458 --> 03:17.625
[Sabretooth screaming]

03:17.625 --> 03:21.291
Such hurt. Such rage.

03:22.583 --> 03:26.166
No wonder Magneto believes
there is no hope of peace.

03:31.875 --> 03:34.583
But we must
never give up trying.

03:37.875 --> 03:40.083
[Cyclops] Magneto thought
we would join him, Professor.

03:40.083 --> 03:41.708
He wanted us to use
our special powers

03:41.708 --> 03:43.583
in his battle
for mutant liberation.

03:43.583 --> 03:46.291
I don't know what corner
you crawled out of, bub.

03:48.958 --> 03:51.750
[Cyclops] When we refused,
he declared us his enemies.

03:54.166 --> 03:57.833
He believes
we are the next stage
in human evolution,

03:57.833 --> 04:01.083
beyond Homo sapiens
to Homo superior,

04:01.083 --> 04:05.291
and that we
are destined to rule
a mutant-control world

04:05.291 --> 04:07.583
under his domination.

04:07.583 --> 04:12.250
Fighting for human-mutant peace
has just become
more dangerous.

04:12.708 --> 04:16.708
Stuff the philosophy.
Let's go kick his butt.

04:18.416 --> 04:21.333
At any rate,
I have some good news.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.625
We can use some.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.250
[Sabretooth growling]

04:33.625 --> 04:35.625
Get him out of here.

04:36.208 --> 04:39.583
[Xavier]
I've been spending
some time with Sabretooth,

04:39.583 --> 04:44.208
probing his mind, working
to help alleviate his rages,

04:44.208 --> 04:47.291
much as I did for Wolverine.

04:47.291 --> 04:52.416
There are still some recesses
of his mind that I have
failed to penetrate.

04:52.416 --> 04:55.125
But I trust I will,
given enough time.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.333
[Wolverine]
I'll penetrate his recesses.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.375
Wolverine!

04:59.166 --> 05:01.708
What's wrong, Wolverine?

05:01.708 --> 05:04.208
No kiss and make-up?

05:04.208 --> 05:05.875
Kiss this.

05:08.125 --> 05:11.583
We used to be old pals.
Even worked together.

05:11.583 --> 05:16.291
But we had some little
misunderstandings.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.708
Yeah, right.

05:18.750 --> 05:24.583
He wasted some friends
of mine for no reason,
and I misunderstood?

05:24.583 --> 05:27.458
Calm down, all of you.

05:27.458 --> 05:30.458
After conquering
your own rages, Wolverine,

05:30.458 --> 05:34.291
you more than anyone know
what Sabretooth
is going through.

05:34.291 --> 05:37.708
I need your assistance
with the next phase
of his therapy.

05:37.708 --> 05:39.458
You got to be kidding!

05:39.458 --> 05:42.333
Tell you what,
long as he's here,

05:42.333 --> 05:44.250
I'm going to be
somewhere else.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.208
Wolverine! Come back!

05:47.250 --> 05:50.625
Don't worry, sweet pea.
He'll ease on back
when he's ready.

05:50.625 --> 05:53.875
We'll deal with
Wolverine's attitude later.

05:53.875 --> 05:57.875
Right now,
we can't be distracted
from our more urgent problem.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.625
Magneto.

05:59.625 --> 06:03.625
His missile attack failed,
but he'll attack again soon.

06:03.625 --> 06:08.208
And next time
he won't be so merciful.

06:08.958 --> 06:13.000
[Magneto] Well, Xavier,
old friend.
Where shall it be, hmm?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.208
Where will you expect me?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.333
One place is as
good as another.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.708
As long as it is populated
with Homo sapiens,

06:20.708 --> 06:23.708
human lives
can be used as bait.

06:26.708 --> 06:29.583
All those
lovely chemicals.

06:29.583 --> 06:34.458
After all, without them,
life itself
would be impossible.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.291
[screaming]

06:45.875 --> 06:47.500
[people screaming]

06:58.708 --> 07:01.750
[Xavier]
Cerebro is monitoring
all emergency frequencies.

07:01.750 --> 07:04.875
If Magneto strikes anywhere
within the vicinity of...

07:04.875 --> 07:06.833
[alarm blaring]

07:06.833 --> 07:09.833
Your old buddy doesn't let
the grass grow under his feet.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.416
He's challenging me!

07:11.416 --> 07:14.083
He'll hurt those workers
just to get at me.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.500
Jubilee, you stay here
and look after Sabretooth.

07:17.875 --> 07:20.166
My favorite job.

07:20.166 --> 07:24.458
Be careful.
Even though he's shackled,
he could still be dangerous.

07:25.708 --> 07:29.750
Now, we must face
the master of magnetism.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.750
Yes, sir.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.875
[people screaming]

07:52.208 --> 07:56.291
I wonder how you'll look,
Charles, after so long.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.291
Perhaps a toupee?

08:00.333 --> 08:01.583
Over there!

08:01.583 --> 08:03.458
[Magneto] I'm disappointed.

08:03.458 --> 08:06.291
I expected Xavier
to be with you.

08:06.291 --> 08:08.250
Sorry to disappoint you,
Magneto.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.166
You'll have to make do with us!

08:19.833 --> 08:23.875
Have you forgotten
that electricity
and magnetism are related?

08:23.875 --> 08:26.833
Maybe I can steal some
of this old boy's thunder.

08:29.125 --> 08:30.500
[Rogue groans]

08:33.166 --> 08:35.416
You've wasted
enough of my time.

08:35.416 --> 08:40.083
If Xavier refuses to face me,
I'll make him regret
his cowardice.

08:43.708 --> 08:45.333
Cyclops, look out.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.708
[coughing]

08:57.458 --> 08:58.625
[Storm] No!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.000
[loud rumbling]

09:08.458 --> 09:09.708
No!

09:10.416 --> 09:11.833
[screaming]

09:13.958 --> 09:16.416
You just can't get
close to some men.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.125
Storm!

09:20.708 --> 09:23.458
Sorry, gal, I don't know
how long I...

09:23.458 --> 09:25.000
[Storm screaming]

09:25.958 --> 09:29.375
How many must suffer
before you will face me?

09:34.291 --> 09:37.500
[Xavier]
Enough, Magneto!
Stop this carnage now!

09:37.500 --> 09:41.625
It's me you want.
So here I am.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.583
Sorry about that, Storm.
Must be losing my touch.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.250
Oh, no.

10:01.625 --> 10:05.708
Come on, baby, don't do this
to me. Those bricks weren't
that heavy.

10:06.166 --> 10:07.625
[groaning]

10:08.958 --> 10:10.750
Don't scare me or anything.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.166
Not you, too!

10:16.375 --> 10:17.958
[coughing]

10:23.625 --> 10:25.625
You're not
going to like this, but...

10:28.208 --> 10:30.000
it's better
than not breathing.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.291
Come on, pretty boy.
Make a girl feel welcome.

10:35.958 --> 10:37.416
[coughing]

10:38.375 --> 10:40.375
Don't worry, I won't tell Jean.

10:40.375 --> 10:41.458
I just hope...

10:41.458 --> 10:42.458
[Rogue grunts]

10:46.375 --> 10:47.375
[grunts]

10:50.500 --> 10:52.000
[coughing]

10:52.625 --> 10:54.125
What's going on?

10:54.125 --> 10:56.458
Cyclops!
I couldn't help it. I...

10:56.458 --> 10:59.000
I absorbed your power
when I touched you.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I mean, how do I turn
this darn thing off?

11:04.083 --> 11:06.375
Your eyes! Shut your eyes!

11:15.125 --> 11:17.833
Cyclops, where are you?
You OK?

11:20.166 --> 11:22.375
You brought me here, Magneto.

11:22.375 --> 11:24.208
The next move is yours.

11:24.208 --> 11:26.958
The years have been
kind to you, Charles.

11:26.958 --> 11:29.375
A pity they haven't
brought you wisdom.

11:29.375 --> 11:33.708
Your wisdom?
You find wisdom
in this destruction?

11:33.708 --> 11:36.333
We have not
always been enemies.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.625
I will give you a final chance.

11:38.625 --> 11:39.875
Never!

11:39.875 --> 11:41.000
Fool!

11:41.000 --> 11:42.708
You still dream of peace

11:42.708 --> 11:45.458
with those who would
destroy all mutants?

11:45.458 --> 11:48.833
Is this your answer?
This horror?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.458
After all the suffering
we both have seen,

11:51.458 --> 11:54.875
you wish me to wage war
on six billion humans?

11:54.875 --> 11:56.208
[people coughing]

11:56.208 --> 11:58.625
When I was a child,
my people talked

11:58.625 --> 12:00.750
while others
prepared for war.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.833
They used reason
while others used tanks,

12:03.833 --> 12:06.875
and they were destroyed
for their trouble.

12:06.875 --> 12:11.875
I won't stand by and watch
it happen again. I won't!

12:12.458 --> 12:13.708
[Xavier yells]

12:16.375 --> 12:19.375
This is not how
I wanted it to end.

12:19.375 --> 12:24.500
I wish it could
have been otherwise.
You were the best of us.

12:25.375 --> 12:27.000
Farewell, Xavier.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.291
Your blindness
has sealed your fate.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.833
[young Magneto] Mama! Papa!

12:45.125 --> 12:49.250
No! No! Don't make me see.

12:49.250 --> 12:53.250
Xavier, I can't!
Stop it! Stop it!

12:53.250 --> 12:57.083
No, Magneto, you will stop.

12:58.208 --> 13:01.458
No. No more!

13:04.125 --> 13:06.625
[screaming]

13:15.458 --> 13:17.458
[Rogue]
Professor, where are you?

13:18.750 --> 13:20.208
I can't see!

13:20.208 --> 13:22.375
I'm right here, Rogue.
Don't move.

13:23.125 --> 13:26.958
OK, but hurry.
I can't open my eyes.
I got Cyclops' powers.

13:26.958 --> 13:28.458
What about
the plant personnel?

13:28.833 --> 13:30.375
They all high-tailed it.

13:41.208 --> 13:44.083
Sounds like this dump's
going to go up like
the Fourth of July.

13:45.416 --> 13:49.125
Let's go home.
I will mentally be
your eyes. Follow me.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.291
[explosions]

14:02.000 --> 14:07.708
[Kelly] Ladies and gentlemen,
the world tonight is in
the grip of a terrible crisis.

14:07.708 --> 14:12.583
Since the President
recklessly rescinded
the Mutant Registration Act,

14:12.583 --> 14:16.083
those unfortunate mistakes
of nature are running wild.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.208
The recent mutant attacks
at Drake Missile Base

14:19.208 --> 14:21.500
and Metro Chemical
are just the beginning.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.625
Senator, what do you
plan to do about it?

14:26.416 --> 14:30.708
I intend, this very evening,
to declare my candidacy

14:30.708 --> 14:33.250
for President
of the United States.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.458
What?

14:35.333 --> 14:38.416
[Jubilee] Right!
And I'm the Queen of England.

14:38.416 --> 14:42.166
As President, I intend
to relocate every mutant

14:42.166 --> 14:46.166
in this nation to internment
camps that will facilitate
the handling

14:46.166 --> 14:48.583
of these poor,
unfortunate creatures.

14:48.583 --> 14:52.958
Just let me get my claws
on that senator's throat.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.875
[growling]

14:55.958 --> 14:58.875
[Kelly] There, under the proper
military supervision...

14:59.875 --> 15:01.125
[Sabretooth growling]

15:04.250 --> 15:08.458
I'm sorry. I'm still
learning to control that.

15:08.458 --> 15:09.708
[sighs]

15:11.416 --> 15:14.083
Thanks to Professor X's help.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.708
Look at your wrist!

15:16.333 --> 15:18.000
It's not bad.

15:19.458 --> 15:21.625
You going to stay calm
while I fix it up?

15:21.625 --> 15:22.833
Sure.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.208
[sighs]

15:24.208 --> 15:27.000
OK, here,
let me take care of it.

15:29.750 --> 15:32.500
There. That's better.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.333
Much better.

15:36.333 --> 15:37.875
I'll get something
to treat it.

15:37.875 --> 15:40.083
I heal real fast!

15:42.333 --> 15:47.833
Lesson number one, girlie.
Never trust nobody.

15:47.833 --> 15:51.583
Your powers ain't so hot
if you can't use your hands.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.166
[grunting]
But your treatments...

15:54.333 --> 15:58.625
You really think a few
mealy-mouthed words

15:58.625 --> 16:01.208
from that old weakling
could change me?

16:01.208 --> 16:06.000
I've been faking it.
I've been waiting
for the right moment.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.083
[laughing]

16:08.708 --> 16:11.166
So, you want
an Oscar or what?

16:11.166 --> 16:13.333
I want to do what
I was sent here to do,

16:13.333 --> 16:16.875
and if you don't want
the life crushed out
of your little body,

16:16.875 --> 16:18.708
you're going to help.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.500
And what's that, dweeb?

16:22.500 --> 16:23.875
[Sabretooth]
Magneto ordered me

16:23.875 --> 16:26.250
to find this place
and take it over.

16:26.250 --> 16:29.708
He knew your buddies
would be at Beast's trial,

16:29.708 --> 16:32.333
and that wimp professor
would take me in.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.708
He's got the X guy figured.

16:34.708 --> 16:39.625
You know, I'm really going
to enjoy tearing this place up.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.750
Now, you get me out
of this rig before I...

16:43.875 --> 16:45.875
You done nice, girlie.

16:46.166 --> 16:49.833
For a reward,
I'll finish you
off clean and fast.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.000
But you said...

16:51.000 --> 16:53.583
[Jubilee grunting]

16:54.000 --> 16:56.416
Wolverine never
should've let me live.

16:56.416 --> 17:00.166
I wish he was here so I could
take care of his carcass, too.

17:00.166 --> 17:01.333
[sniffing]

17:02.250 --> 17:05.000
Be careful what you
ask for, old buddy.

17:05.583 --> 17:08.416
It just might come true.

17:09.583 --> 17:13.333
Good thing I didn't go
too far away
to cool off, Sabretooth.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.250
This is between you and me.

17:15.250 --> 17:16.416
Let the girl go.

17:17.416 --> 17:20.083
Whatever you say, pal.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.583
[Rogue screaming]

17:23.125 --> 17:27.375
So, you're doing
the dirty work
for Magneto now, eh?

17:28.166 --> 17:31.000
You used to
backstab people for fun.

17:31.416 --> 17:34.125
What turned you
into a rat-for-hire?

17:34.125 --> 17:36.583
I'd heard you'd gone soft.

17:36.583 --> 17:38.291
I was curious.

17:38.583 --> 17:42.333
I think maybe I heard right.

17:42.333 --> 17:45.500
All right, you egg-sucking
piece of gutter trash.

17:45.500 --> 17:48.958
You always liked
pushing around people
smaller than you.

17:48.958 --> 17:52.000
Well, I'm smaller!
Try pushing me!

17:52.000 --> 17:53.375
[Wolverine roaring]

17:56.458 --> 17:57.583
[both grunting]

18:00.083 --> 18:01.125
[yells]

18:03.458 --> 18:04.500
[yells]

18:08.583 --> 18:12.333
How about a little
taste of adamantium

18:13.583 --> 18:15.416
for old time's sake?

18:15.416 --> 18:16.583
[grunting]

18:20.000 --> 18:21.625
It's good to be home again.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.208
Oh, that tastes good.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.833
I'm breathing better,
Professor.

18:32.833 --> 18:34.250
And my powers are back.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.833
We'll have to do it
again sometime.

18:39.833 --> 18:41.083
Yeah, well...

18:41.708 --> 18:43.083
[loud bang]

18:44.333 --> 18:45.458
The war room!

18:48.000 --> 18:51.208
[Wolverine] You always were
second best.

18:51.875 --> 18:53.500
[screaming]

18:55.291 --> 18:56.375
[grunts]

18:59.125 --> 19:04.000
And in this business, bub,
second best don't cut it!

19:04.625 --> 19:08.208
Wolverine!
What did I teach
you about revenge?

19:08.208 --> 19:11.000
How often have I warned
you about letting your
personal feelings

19:11.000 --> 19:13.375
endanger the work
of our team?

19:13.375 --> 19:15.875
But Sabretooth was
about to total me!

19:15.875 --> 19:17.416
Magneto sent him to do it!

19:18.416 --> 19:21.208
You're out of line, Professor.
All I...

19:21.208 --> 19:22.583
[Sabretooth roars]

19:25.583 --> 19:26.708
Wolverine!

19:27.166 --> 19:28.333
[roaring]

19:28.333 --> 19:29.416
No!

19:29.416 --> 19:30.958
[screaming]

19:34.208 --> 19:35.333
[grunting]

19:38.833 --> 19:41.333
Rogue!
Get him to the infirmary. Fast!

19:44.000 --> 19:47.416
[Xavier] He's stabilized.
He's going to be all right.

19:47.416 --> 19:49.958
I was wrong, Wolverine.

19:50.750 --> 19:52.250
I should have
listened to you.

19:53.208 --> 19:58.250
I let my passion for an ideal
that all mutants could be
brothers blind me.

19:58.250 --> 20:00.208
That's twice I've failed.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.833
We failed, Professor.
Together.

20:02.833 --> 20:05.166
We cannot afford
to lose again,

20:05.166 --> 20:08.083
or Magneto and those
like him will prevail.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.416
He's out there,
scheming, planning.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.458
I was able
to trick him today.

20:14.458 --> 20:17.291
But I wonder
when the time comes,

20:17.291 --> 20:19.625
will the X-Men be ready?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.208
[Magneto] All right, Xavier.

20:22.208 --> 20:25.166
You've cast your lot
with humankind.

20:25.166 --> 20:27.458
But the others
will understand.

20:27.458 --> 20:32.958
Mutants will come
to me by the thousands,
and we shall destroy you!

20:37.416 --> 20:38.416
[theme music playing]
