01:15.348 --> 01:17.082
- How am I doing?
- Killing it, man.

01:17.084 --> 01:19.150
Keep working on rebounding
from the hit

01:19.152 --> 01:20.518
and there'll be three
Malloys on varsity.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.388
- Come on, dude! Gimme the puck!
- No, gimme the puck!

01:23.390 --> 01:26.291
- Jack!
- Four if you count your dad.

01:26.293 --> 01:28.293
Jack, "it's not whether
you get knocked down;

01:28.295 --> 01:31.129
it's whether you get
back up." Vince Lombardi.

01:31.131 --> 01:33.398
"But ya gotta get up
quicker." Coach Malloy.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.400
Son or not, if you don't
recover quicker,

01:35.402 --> 01:37.202
you're not making my team.

01:37.204 --> 01:40.305
Understood, coach. Will work on
my post-check rallying, sir.

01:45.378 --> 01:46.878
So, sassy met Aspen

01:46.880 --> 01:48.847
at Fashionista
glam camp this summer.

01:48.849 --> 01:50.315
No big shocker there.

01:50.317 --> 01:52.517
No wonder. I thought
it was weird that Aspen

01:52.519 --> 01:55.487
just transferred in and sassy's
already under her spell.

01:55.489 --> 01:57.589
Fashionista glam camp.
What do they even do there?

01:57.591 --> 01:59.357
Who knows and who cares?

02:00.127 --> 02:02.260
Ok, girls, hustle in!

02:04.865 --> 02:07.398
Ok, we are going
to make a shift.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.901
Claire, I'm gonna be working with you
today, Ellie, you're gonna spot MacKenzie,

02:10.904 --> 02:13.671
and Aspen,
you're gonna spot sassy.

02:14.441 --> 02:17.142
What?! But coach, sassy and I
have been practice partners

02:17.144 --> 02:19.244
- since, like, forever.
- Don't exaggerate, El.

02:19.246 --> 02:21.779
Like, only since kindergarten.

02:21.781 --> 02:23.781
Ok, but Aspen is new to town...

02:23.783 --> 02:25.450
- From New York!
- Buffalo, New York.

02:25.452 --> 02:27.752
- It's still New York.
- It is still New York.

02:27.754 --> 02:30.889
And she and sassy are just a
better physical match, ok?

02:30.891 --> 02:32.824
Ok, moving on!

02:32.826 --> 02:35.260
Ok. Focus zone.
First varsity,

02:35.262 --> 02:37.195
then early acceptance
into Boston college,

02:37.197 --> 02:39.764
- then drafted by the bruins...
- Yeah, I've seen "the list",

02:39.766 --> 02:41.699
- Jackattack.
- Bro,

02:41.701 --> 02:44.435
don't worry about coach.
You're cruising past everyone.

02:44.437 --> 02:47.772
But keep an eye
on dumbledork over there.

02:47.774 --> 02:50.275
Who, Porter? He's been
trying to escape j.V.

02:50.277 --> 02:51.576
Since we were sophomores.

02:51.578 --> 02:53.745
He'd knock his own
grandmother's teeth out

02:53.747 --> 02:56.247
just to keep another Malloy
from getting a spot.

02:59.419 --> 03:01.386
Yo, you got this, bro.

03:02.455 --> 03:05.790
Girls, it is time to put
your big girl leotards on,

03:05.792 --> 03:07.792
because the rumors they're true.

03:07.794 --> 03:10.695
- Trumors. -The school
is making budget cuts

03:10.697 --> 03:13.531
and is eliminating
one of the sports teams,

03:13.533 --> 03:18.803
so it is between the badminton
team -gross, I know, ew- and us.

03:18.805 --> 03:22.674
So if we don't win big on Sunday against
silver leaf high, and I mean big,

03:22.676 --> 03:25.944
they are gonna
demote us to a club.

03:25.946 --> 03:29.681
- A club? -That's what I said.
- Like chess, or thespians?

03:29.683 --> 03:33.384
- For serious? This is tragical!
- Coach, they can't do that!

03:33.386 --> 03:37.522
My dad, uh, people will never drive
halfway across the state to see a club!

03:37.524 --> 03:40.325
I know that, and...
Aw, come on!

03:40.327 --> 03:42.760
Oh, my goodness!
Are you alright, Carol?

03:42.762 --> 03:45.496
That was my mistake.
I was aiming for your neck.

03:45.498 --> 03:49.334
- Aim for your neck next time!
- That doesn't make sense.

03:49.336 --> 03:53.304
I will come over there,
I will break you in half!

03:55.442 --> 03:59.577
Ok, you guys, you're
gonna be fine. I mean,

03:59.579 --> 04:01.613
with Ellie as
your old powerhouse

04:01.615 --> 04:04.449
and Aspen as your new
powerhouse, how can you lose?

04:14.561 --> 04:16.861
Jack, be the puck!
Be the stick!

04:16.863 --> 04:19.529
Be the puck and the stick
and the space in between!

04:20.433 --> 04:22.967
- Are you listening?
- Wha...?

04:22.969 --> 04:25.737
Not looking, listening!

04:34.881 --> 04:37.915
Not so tough for a coach's
kid, are you, Malloy?

04:37.917 --> 04:40.385
You can't even take a hit.

04:46.559 --> 04:50.295
I can take a hit, Porter, and I'll
take that last varsity spot too.

05:00.774 --> 05:03.741
- Yeah!

05:04.911 --> 05:07.979
Listen up, Shmelts!
Bring it in!

05:10.083 --> 05:15.053
Ok, decent job. But whoever's
gonna get that last varsity spot,

05:15.055 --> 05:18.489
I'm gonna need to see your a-game,
and that's not just on the ice,

05:18.491 --> 05:21.025
but off it, too!
No horse playin',

05:21.027 --> 05:24.495
no high jinksin',

05:24.497 --> 05:27.799
and definitely no
unsportsmanlike shenanigangin'!

05:27.801 --> 05:31.002
We've got two more days
of tryouts, boys.

05:31.004 --> 05:33.671
Show me what you're made of!

05:33.673 --> 05:36.641
You wanna rescue this team,
don't you? Yeah.

05:36.643 --> 05:40.411
You do. Everything you need
is inside you right now.

05:40.413 --> 05:43.381
You just have to find it. You're
not little girls anymore!

05:43.383 --> 05:46.417
You're men now! The world's
gonna be your oyster!

05:46.419 --> 05:49.721
You're women, hear you roar!

05:49.723 --> 05:52.623
- Right?

05:52.625 --> 05:55.727
- And all you've gotta do...
- -Is not blow it!

05:58.998 --> 06:02.066
Don't leave me hanging here.
Yes! Don't blow it!

06:02.068 --> 06:04.836
Yeah! Don't blow it, boys!

06:04.838 --> 06:09.407
Don't blow it! Don't
blow it! Don't blow it!

06:12.579 --> 06:15.780
Good job, you guys. But don't leave
me next time that long, right?

06:15.782 --> 06:18.015
'Cause for me,
that's very awkward.

06:18.017 --> 06:20.918
Oh, he's coming down! Oh!

06:20.920 --> 06:23.554
We've got nothing.

06:23.556 --> 06:26.824
Dude, ya gotta chop that salad. You
practically got a man bun going.

06:26.826 --> 06:29.394
- Nobody's touching my hair, dude.
- Come on,

06:29.396 --> 06:32.663
it's a varsity tradition. Plus it might
help you with your "lady troubles".

06:32.665 --> 06:34.732
Shut it.

06:34.734 --> 06:38.736
- Quit bustin' his chops, Sally.
- Who you chirpin' at, Mary?

06:42.675 --> 06:45.576
Aw, you gonna cry, baby butter?

06:45.578 --> 06:47.979
- Man up!
- Not crying.

06:47.981 --> 06:50.648
Champ.

06:52.152 --> 06:55.586
Oh! You might cry
when coach sees that!

06:55.588 --> 06:58.890
- Yeah, thanks, guys. -Oh,
little bro pushing back!

07:44.904 --> 07:47.205
Broskinator. Here.

07:47.207 --> 07:51.876
I know it's pink, but at least
it still has service. Coach said

07:51.878 --> 07:54.245
he didn't shut it off because
he paid the year in advance,

07:54.247 --> 07:57.081
but I think he just couldn't.

07:58.852 --> 08:02.553
Nah, it's ok. I'll just go off
the grid for a little while.

08:02.555 --> 08:04.522
How's he gonna text you
his inspirational quotes?

08:04.524 --> 08:07.892
'Sides, I already
transferred your number.

08:10.129 --> 08:12.630
Mom sure did love her sparkles.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.035
Hey, what soon-to-be varsity athlete doesn't
want a twinkly sequined lady phone?

08:23.843 --> 08:27.545
Mom? What's with the car?

08:27.547 --> 08:30.248
Oh, I Feng shui-ed it, honey, to
give you a stronger life force

08:30.250 --> 08:32.750
for the big weekend coming up!

08:32.751 --> 08:35.686
- I'm excited. Are you so excited?
- Yeah.

08:35.688 --> 08:38.054
Oh, I got that.

08:40.592 --> 08:42.025
Let's go!

08:48.268 --> 08:51.736
Sweetie, won't you let me
get you a new phone?

08:51.738 --> 08:54.205
Your dad left that ancient thing
behind for a reason.

08:54.207 --> 08:56.641
It's not ancient. It's...

08:56.643 --> 08:59.110
Retro-chic.

08:59.112 --> 09:02.780
I just think you're attaching too much
significance to an inanimate object.

09:02.782 --> 09:03.908
"Mystical religions 101."

09:03.933 --> 09:07.151
Early shamans knew investing too much
emotional energy in an object...

09:07.153 --> 09:09.320
Could make it a totem
and give it power over you.

09:09.322 --> 09:12.089
Mom, it's a cell phone,
not Gollum's ring.

09:12.091 --> 09:16.694
Hey, Jacko! You're 30 seconds late for
"one-on-one truck time" with coach.

09:16.696 --> 09:20.965
- He's pulling up now. You know how
he hates to wait. -Come on, buddy.

09:36.182 --> 09:38.816
"Better three hours too soon
than a minute late."

09:40.119 --> 09:42.119
Shakespeare.

09:42.121 --> 09:45.356
Not even an athlete. Not with
those pantaloony things he wore.

09:45.358 --> 09:48.593
Yes, sir. Probably not, sir.

09:50.863 --> 09:54.632
Would it really be so bad
if the team became a club?

09:54.634 --> 09:57.635
I was in Spanish club and
it was "muy divertido"!

09:57.637 --> 09:59.704
And MacKenzie is
in stem club, isn't she?

09:59.706 --> 10:02.073
At least it would be something
new, and "new" is good.

10:02.075 --> 10:05.710
New moons, new experiences,
perhaps a new best friend?

10:05.712 --> 10:09.914
- Sassy's my best friend. -Well, maybe
you could let some new energy in.

10:09.916 --> 10:13.150
I mean, isn't that
what sassy's doing?

10:56.863 --> 11:00.164
Thanks.

11:00.166 --> 11:02.700
Have such a good day,
sweetie! Mommy loves you.

11:02.702 --> 11:06.170
- Bye, mom. -'Sup, dog breath?
- 'Sup, dork chop?

11:06.172 --> 11:08.005
Good to see you, bud.

11:10.243 --> 11:13.044
Hey! 'Sup, hot mama?

11:13.680 --> 11:16.747
News flash?
Skirts don't have legs.

11:18.317 --> 11:21.185
- So embarrassing...
- Amirite?

11:23.956 --> 11:27.725
- There. We good?
- Not really.

11:27.727 --> 11:30.861
Sass, come on, you know we always wear
our tracksuits the Friday before a meet.

11:30.863 --> 11:34.065
- Rg pride, right?
- Yeah! Wish I hadn't caved.

11:34.067 --> 11:37.902
Uh, yeah, we did, like,
make a pact last year...

11:37.904 --> 11:41.305
Well, I wasn't here last year
to lead a fashion rescue,

11:41.307 --> 11:43.974
- now was I?

11:43.976 --> 11:48.179
Ooh, sassy, look! It's your future
first husband, Jack Malloy!

11:49.082 --> 11:52.750
You like Jack?
You didn't tell me.

11:52.752 --> 11:54.452
Does he even know who you are?

11:54.454 --> 11:58.189
Have you never heard of a vision board?
Jack is all over hers.

11:58.191 --> 12:01.125
- Go ahead, do it like we practiced.
- Ok.

12:08.401 --> 12:11.302
- Jack, here comes a girl!
- Say something.

12:11.304 --> 12:13.370
Hey, guys.

12:13.372 --> 12:16.040
Heeeyyyy, Jaaaaack.

12:17.243 --> 12:19.477
Uh...

12:19.479 --> 12:21.345
Uh...

12:21.347 --> 12:23.247
Ha...

12:26.252 --> 12:28.252
Well, at least this time you
opened your mouth, Bromigo.

12:28.254 --> 12:30.821
Yeah. Maybe next time
words will come out.

12:30.823 --> 12:34.391
Ooh, I love the strong
silent type!

12:42.969 --> 12:46.270
Nice phone, Malloy. You use that
to schedule your Mani-pedis?

12:46.272 --> 12:49.173
Hey, I was thinkin'.

12:49.175 --> 12:52.343
Doesn't coach have a rule, if you start
a fight you can't be on varsity?

12:52.345 --> 12:54.750
You oughta know, you've
tried out three times.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.080
Actually, four times.

12:56.082 --> 12:58.783
Did sophomore year twice, idiot.

13:00.987 --> 13:03.387
Go ahead, ladies first!

13:03.389 --> 13:05.610
Then it'll look like you started
it when I show the video to coach.

13:05.634 --> 13:06.490
Or does that even matter?

13:06.492 --> 13:10.094
Don't all Malloys get
a free ride onto varsity?

13:11.931 --> 13:14.832
Ha, worked better than
I expected. Oh, man.

13:14.834 --> 13:17.067
Say goodbye to
your dreams, buddy.

13:31.551 --> 13:35.252
Seriously?! I've had a milk
mustache since lunch?!

13:41.327 --> 13:44.995
You think things with Ellie are tough now?
It's only gonna get worse, babe.

13:44.997 --> 13:48.165
I mean, people like us have to make
legit tough decisions sometimes.

13:48.167 --> 13:52.336
I know, I know. I wish Ellie'd just
get it without me having to be all

13:52.338 --> 13:55.306
- super awk obvious.
- It's kind of sad, actually.

13:55.308 --> 13:58.909
Almost as sad as that ponytail.
I mean, what is she, 12? Oh,

13:58.911 --> 14:01.412
and daddy's heirloom phone? Why
is she so attached to that thing?

14:01.414 --> 14:03.981
- Like, move on already!
- Yeah, I mean,

14:03.983 --> 14:07.952
it was super sad when her dad left,
but, like, life goes on and...

14:07.954 --> 14:10.254
Ooh, is that "paparazzi pucker"?

14:10.256 --> 14:13.991
No, it's called
"lip glossip". Try it!

14:13.993 --> 14:17.294
Maybe I can just tell her she's
being too clingy and she'll, like,

14:17.296 --> 14:19.363
change? I mean,

14:19.365 --> 14:22.066
I don't want to actually
hurt her feelings.

14:22.068 --> 14:26.136
Ok, ok, fine, give her one more chance,
keep her on social life support.

14:26.138 --> 14:30.107
But if she's her typical buzzkill self
at Claire's party, it might be time

14:30.109 --> 14:32.910
to pull the plug. Beep.

14:32.912 --> 14:35.112
Beep. Beep.

14:35.114 --> 14:37.648
Beeeeep.

15:03.943 --> 15:07.478
It's my lucky day. I got a crier
and a kid with a bloody nose.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.447
Here. Wipe off
the tears, kid.

15:10.449 --> 15:13.617
You took quite a hit, didn't
you, hon? You want cry?

15:13.619 --> 15:15.619
We won't tell anybody.

15:15.621 --> 15:18.155
Not crying. Not a girl.

15:19.191 --> 15:20.658
No offense.

15:20.660 --> 15:23.060
None taken.

15:24.463 --> 15:26.964
Oh, that makes it
less offensive?

15:26.966 --> 15:29.400
"Not crying". Yeah,
'cause you've got nothing

15:29.402 --> 15:31.669
to cry about! I mean,
you're a guy, aren't you?

15:31.671 --> 15:34.238
If someone disses you, you don't
have to hide in a bathroom stall.

15:34.240 --> 15:37.308
- Guys have it so easy!
- Ok, pull it back, pit bull!

15:37.310 --> 15:39.343
In what universe
do guys have it easy?

15:39.345 --> 15:42.713
If some ginosaurus tricked you into
a fight, think people'd blame you?!

15:42.715 --> 15:45.516
No, you'd just get all emo then hug
it out with your mom in the kitchen

15:45.518 --> 15:48.218
- while you bake banana bread or...
- Ok, zip it.

15:48.220 --> 15:50.454
You wanna fight
the battle of the sexes?

15:50.456 --> 15:53.490
Why don't you just text,
like every other kid does?

15:53.492 --> 15:55.960
No more yakking in my office.

15:55.962 --> 16:00.698
- This one's hers, mine is the pink one.
- I don't care and I mean it.

16:00.700 --> 16:04.134
Keep those Mac'n'cheese
holes shut.

16:52.084 --> 16:54.418
Fine, you wanna goof off,

16:54.420 --> 16:56.787
I'm gonna go to the snack bar,
get myself some pork rinds.

16:58.124 --> 16:59.423
I love pork rinds.

17:02.428 --> 17:05.162
Why am I on the floor?

17:05.164 --> 17:09.266
Did I forget deodorant?
I smell like a dude.

17:09.268 --> 17:13.270
And why does my thumb taste
like athletic tape and dirt?

17:15.107 --> 17:19.042
What the what? Wait,
who painted my fingernails?

17:29.655 --> 17:31.789
You... you stole my face!

17:31.791 --> 17:35.426
You stole my whole body!
How'd you get inside?

17:35.428 --> 17:37.428
How'd I get inside?

17:37.430 --> 17:40.464
This is like a nightmare!
I feel so grimy!

17:40.466 --> 17:43.133
Dude! Slap me,
and I'll slap you,

17:43.135 --> 17:46.303
and we'll see if we can slap each
other -ourselves-back to reality!

17:46.305 --> 17:47.638
Ok.

17:49.241 --> 17:51.408
- Ow!
- Oh!

17:51.410 --> 17:54.745
Oh, sorry! Boy hands
just hit so hard!

17:55.548 --> 17:58.082
Ew, why am I so sweaty
in weird places?

17:58.084 --> 18:01.318
- What is the purpose of underarm hair?
- Dude, focustrate!

18:01.320 --> 18:04.855
What exactly were we doing right
before this... This thing happened?

18:04.857 --> 18:06.323
Texting. We were texting!

18:07.760 --> 18:11.562
- "I wish I had your life..." - "Take it.
Then I'd get yours."

18:13.866 --> 18:15.632
We did this!

18:15.634 --> 18:18.769
No! No! It's just a stupid text!
I once texted a wish

18:18.771 --> 18:21.605
that I could power fart myself across the
ice and trust me, that didn't happen!

18:21.607 --> 18:24.374
Ok, you're right. I mean, a text
can't have that kind of power.

18:24.376 --> 18:27.845
Investing too much emotional energy in an
object could make it a totem and give it power

18:27.847 --> 18:30.781
- over you.
- But wait! A totem can!

18:32.218 --> 18:35.519
That phone! Is it, like,
special to you in some way?

18:35.521 --> 18:39.256
I guess. Yeah. I mean... it
belonged to somebody special.

18:40.526 --> 18:43.527
I can't believe it. My mom
isn't crazy after all.

18:44.130 --> 18:47.164
She took this class on mystical religions,
and if you put too much emotional energy

18:47.166 --> 18:51.168
into one object, you could turn it into a
totem, and then it could have power over you.

18:51.170 --> 18:53.604
Bro, no way, that is nuts!

18:54.507 --> 18:55.672
We just swapped bodies!

18:55.674 --> 18:57.808
You got a better theory,
Mr. lady?

18:57.810 --> 19:01.545
Ok, we gotta
un-text our wish!

19:08.187 --> 19:11.421
Maybe it's the second part of the text?
We said our lives would be better

19:11.423 --> 19:14.458
if we were each other.
But we didn't mean it!

19:14.460 --> 19:16.318
Your mom must have a
book from that class,

19:16.343 --> 19:18.262
right? So we sneak over
to your house and...

19:18.264 --> 19:22.399
I can't sneak anywhere! My mom's, like, got
her pilot's license in helicopter parenting!

19:22.401 --> 19:24.568
- Ok, ok!

19:24.570 --> 19:26.436
We gotta fake being each other
till we can get there!

19:26.438 --> 19:28.839
Speed coaching,
one on one, let's do this!

19:31.177 --> 19:34.444
- Ew! Don't get your spit all over it!
- Technically it's your spit,

19:34.446 --> 19:36.346
but... oh, who cares? Focus
zone!

19:37.783 --> 19:39.850
Oh, just lemme do it!

19:41.453 --> 19:43.453
Ok, fine, whatever, me first.

19:43.455 --> 19:46.790
Hockey is my life. I live with
my dad and twin brothers.

19:46.792 --> 19:49.927
- You live with all guys?!
- We call my dad coach,

19:49.929 --> 19:53.964
and we exercise a lot,
like, a lot a lot. Ah!

19:53.966 --> 19:58.535
Sorry! Ok, me. I live with my
mom, she's a yoga instructor

19:58.537 --> 20:01.638
and she schedules, like,
her entire life around me.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.741
- I specialize in the ribbon in rhythmic gymnastics.
- Is that what it's called?

20:04.743 --> 20:07.411
I've seen you girls jumping
around or whatever.

20:07.413 --> 20:09.880
It's called practice!

20:09.882 --> 20:12.249
R.G. Is a totally legit sport!

20:12.918 --> 20:16.853
- Ah! Don't yank, twinkle toes!
- What now, highlights?

20:16.855 --> 20:18.622
Get out.

20:27.299 --> 20:29.161
I think you might need
glasses for your eyeballs,

20:29.185 --> 20:30.834
I'm getting vertigo. I
think I'm gonna puke.

20:30.836 --> 20:34.972
No puking in my body! Ugh, how do you
carry yourself around on these feet?

20:37.409 --> 20:41.578
No! She can't see us together! She likes
y... and she can't think I like...

20:41.580 --> 20:44.815
Can't break girl code!
Just get away, get away!

20:44.817 --> 20:48.418
Heeeeeyyyy, Jaaaaaack.

20:49.655 --> 20:53.924
Oh! Uh... hey there,
miss sassy.

20:53.926 --> 20:57.494
Ohh, so you do know my name!

20:57.496 --> 21:00.430
Um, Ellie? What
are you doing here?

21:00.432 --> 21:03.033
Uhh.

21:04.536 --> 21:07.037
Mmmmaaa. Suh... suh...

21:09.675 --> 21:12.509
See? Buzzkiller.

21:13.612 --> 21:15.712
I'm gonna make my mom late
for Bikram belly dancing.

21:15.714 --> 21:18.749
And as we all know, Bikram
is amazeballs. So let's go.

21:18.751 --> 21:21.485
I hope to see you soon,

21:21.487 --> 21:23.954
Mr. Malloy.

21:27.059 --> 21:30.394
What was that?!
"Uhh... maaa... suh-suh"?

21:30.396 --> 21:33.430
I just, I'm not used to being
a girl, ok? I choked!

21:33.432 --> 21:37.301
Where's the "we're gonna have to fake
it" guy? I mean, she's my best friend

21:37.303 --> 21:40.971
and we're... going
through a thing right now

21:40.973 --> 21:43.307
- and you can't make things worse!
- Ok, just don't lose it!

21:43.309 --> 21:45.742
'Cause nothing would make things
worse for me than my father

21:45.744 --> 21:48.412
or anyone else seeing my body
blubbering like that!

21:48.414 --> 21:51.882
- Sorry if I have real emotions, ok?
- Shh! Come on, this way!

21:53.519 --> 21:56.386
Malloy! Guess
where I'm headed?

21:56.388 --> 21:58.655
Over to a viewing party
with coach,

21:58.657 --> 22:01.625
A.K.A.K... a.,

22:01.627 --> 22:04.361
- your daddy.
- What is your problem, dude?

22:04.363 --> 22:06.963
Why can't you just
leave me, her,

22:06.965 --> 22:10.500
him alone? Stop
spreading your misery, man!

22:10.502 --> 22:13.737
A firecracker, aren't ya?
What's your name, tracksuit?

22:13.739 --> 22:16.039
Uh... Ellie?

22:16.041 --> 22:18.742
Ellie. I'm Porter. Hi.

22:18.744 --> 22:21.545
It's a pleasure. Please
tell me you're not with him.

22:21.547 --> 22:24.414
- No way. Not even possible.
- You like donuts, Ellie?

22:24.416 --> 22:27.684
I got a little buy a dozen get
one free coupon for donut diggs.

22:28.887 --> 22:31.822
Maybe I can give you my freebie?
Tomorrow A.M.?

22:32.524 --> 22:34.958
Yes! But, uh...

22:36.028 --> 22:39.062
Heeeeeeyyyy, pooooorrrrty...

22:39.064 --> 22:41.565
- I'm gonna be sick.
- I'd looovvve

22:41.567 --> 22:45.702
to go out for a fried pastry.
You know,

22:45.704 --> 22:48.872
if you do me a solid and don't
show Jack's dad that video thingy.

22:48.874 --> 22:51.541
S'pose it can wait one more day.

22:51.543 --> 22:53.744
Alright then.

22:53.746 --> 22:56.646
10am manana.

22:57.649 --> 23:00.684
"Porty". That's awesome.

23:02.654 --> 23:05.155
Ugh! I need a disinfecting bath.

23:05.157 --> 23:08.125
I am not going out with "Porty",
and neither is my body!

23:08.127 --> 23:12.095
Hey, if I have to be a girl, I'll at least
use it to make things better for the guy-me.

23:12.097 --> 23:14.898
- Alright, but we gotta split up.
- Hey, Jackalope!

23:14.900 --> 23:16.800
Let's go. But call me.

23:21.173 --> 23:24.608
Man, I don't know how you're gonna
make it through tryouts today.

23:24.610 --> 23:27.778
You can't blow this! My whole
future depends on hockey!

23:27.780 --> 23:30.647
Yeah, well, rhythmic is everything
to me, and my dad is driving out

23:30.649 --> 23:33.583
for my meet on Sunday!
So, ditto, like, times 100!

23:33.585 --> 23:35.919
I think I can handle flipping some
ribbons and doing somersaults.

23:35.921 --> 23:39.022
Seriously? That's what
you think we do? Ow!

23:39.024 --> 23:41.758
The rhinestones on this thing
are cutting up my face.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.060
Which could use some serious
exfoliation, by the way.

23:44.062 --> 23:46.163
I told you,
you gotta keep sparkly

23:46.165 --> 23:48.832
and I gotta keep this... Relic
until everything's settled!

23:48.834 --> 23:52.803
If my dad called and I answered with
this chick voice, we'd be toast!

23:54.706 --> 23:57.007
Ok, my brothers Gunner and
Stryker are picking me up.

23:57.009 --> 24:00.811
Gunner, Stryker and Jack? They run out
of cool names at the cool name store?

24:01.213 --> 24:03.980
Coach picked their names,
my mom picked my...

24:03.982 --> 24:06.450
Just look for a blue truck, ok?

24:06.452 --> 24:09.052
Alright, and you look for a yoga
type lady in a red bubble car.

24:09.054 --> 24:12.456
Ok. I'll call you after practice
when I get the totem book.

24:12.458 --> 24:14.624
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

24:26.038 --> 24:28.772
Ellie! What are you doing?
That is so dangerous!

24:28.774 --> 24:30.774
Yes, sir! Sorry, sir!

24:30.776 --> 24:33.844
I mean, lady. Ma'am.

24:33.846 --> 24:35.612
Mom.

24:39.251 --> 24:42.786
Hey, Jacko! Come on! What are
you waiting for, an invitation?

24:42.788 --> 24:45.722
OMG. This is a thing?

24:54.166 --> 24:56.633
'Sup, champ? First day
on the new legs?

24:58.103 --> 25:01.872
You know I can't resist that
little puppy face of yours.

25:01.874 --> 25:04.040
All is forgiven.

25:04.042 --> 25:06.743
This is so weird.

25:10.048 --> 25:12.082
So! How was your day?

25:12.084 --> 25:16.086
Uh... totally unreal.

25:16.088 --> 25:19.589
Awesome! So, who d'you sit with
at lunch? What'd you talk about?

25:19.591 --> 25:23.627
Claire's mom told me all about the party
tomorrow night. Is everybody super excited?

25:23.629 --> 25:26.334
I would be so super excited. She
told me it's a Paris theme.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.821
Ooh la la, that sounds amazing!

25:28.967 --> 25:30.901
We should get you a new dress.

25:35.807 --> 25:38.842
So what do you say, shaggy?
Chop-chop for the fuh-fuh?

25:38.844 --> 25:41.177
You up for it?
Chopping the salad?

25:41.179 --> 25:43.113
Uh... I guess?

25:43.115 --> 25:45.715
Seriously? Sweet!

25:45.717 --> 25:47.951
Stryke is going to flip!

25:49.721 --> 25:51.655
Little buddy.

26:18.817 --> 26:21.117
What? No way am I
putting this thing on.

26:21.119 --> 26:24.354
Over my dead girl body.

26:24.356 --> 26:28.124
Five, six, seven, eight, and
reaching up into the sky. Chin up.

26:28.126 --> 26:30.961
You gotta keep your chin up
in life. And...

26:30.963 --> 26:34.297
Five, six, seven, eight,
and kick, two, three, four,

26:34.299 --> 26:37.701
and point, toes, toes, toes,
like your life depends on it.

26:37.703 --> 26:41.371
And reaching up into the sky,
reach, reach, hold your toes

26:41.373 --> 26:44.307
as much as you can. It's really
hard, it hurts me to watch.

26:44.309 --> 26:48.244
And reaching over,
and hold that hug, hug,

26:48.246 --> 26:51.648
and... huh.

26:55.053 --> 26:57.387
Ellie?

27:00.292 --> 27:03.259
What? I got chilly.

27:03.261 --> 27:05.829
Freak just keeps
getting freakier.

27:05.831 --> 27:08.098
Right. No, it's not appropriate.

27:08.100 --> 27:11.234
No. Here we go:
Five, six, seven, eight,

27:11.236 --> 27:13.970
and reaching up to the sky

27:13.972 --> 27:17.974
like "what have I done with my
life?" And kick, two, three, four.

27:25.884 --> 27:26.884
Whoa!

28:00.752 --> 28:04.287
Oh, what is that? It smells like someone
boiled a cabbage in a sweat sock!

28:06.758 --> 28:08.992
Yeah, Stryke had
the chili at lunch.

28:08.994 --> 28:12.028
Dude! Heard you're gonna
let me mow the flow!

28:13.098 --> 28:14.330
That deserves a bropile!

28:21.406 --> 28:22.472
Alright, alright.

28:24.309 --> 28:25.809
Time to trim the fringe.

28:43.995 --> 28:46.396
What?

28:47.733 --> 28:50.300
Hey, it's Jack. Leave
a message. Or don't.

28:50.302 --> 28:53.503
I would kill you, Jack Malloy,
but I can't live without you.

28:53.505 --> 28:55.839
Hit me back.

29:12.491 --> 29:17.093
I'm sorry, Jack, I just... I
can't get yelled at right now.

29:17.095 --> 29:20.864
Alright, sport, go grab your bucket
and breezers, we'll fire you up

29:20.866 --> 29:23.933
- a protein shake before tryouts.
- Right, my...

29:23.935 --> 29:27.537
Bucket and... breezer..
Breezers.

29:29.007 --> 29:31.341
Ok.

29:32.344 --> 29:34.978
So, can we talk
about the phone again?

29:34.980 --> 29:38.882
Oh yeah! You mean about the totem thing?
Awesome! Let's break it down.

29:38.884 --> 29:41.951
Oh, Ellie! I'm so glad we're on
the same wavelength about this!

29:41.953 --> 29:45.555
So let's say this totem had
some kind of power over you.

29:45.557 --> 29:48.525
What would you need to do
to, like, un-power it?

29:48.527 --> 29:51.494
Funny you should ask!
'Cause I did exactly that!

29:51.496 --> 29:54.397
I deactivated your flip
phone and got you a new one!

29:54.399 --> 29:57.934
- Deactivated?! -Well, the switch
won't be official until Sunday.

29:57.936 --> 30:01.538
- Sunday?! -It seemed
like perfect timing,

30:01.540 --> 30:04.007
because we're on the cusp of a
harvest moon... -Harvest moon?

30:04.009 --> 30:08.011
- And that's when the old data
plan expires. -Expires?!

30:08.013 --> 30:11.848
Sweetheart, your aura
seems to have an echo.

30:29.601 --> 30:33.536
Nooooooo!!!

30:35.273 --> 30:37.907
My hair!

30:39.945 --> 30:43.346
- Bro!
- Babe? Now your aura is yelling.

30:48.854 --> 30:50.920
Whoa.

30:50.922 --> 30:53.056
The bros finally got ya, huh?

30:53.058 --> 30:55.925
Now c'mon, suit up! Your dad
wants you on the ice, man.

30:55.927 --> 30:59.162
My dad? Oh, right.

30:59.164 --> 31:01.297
Let's go, ladies!

31:01.299 --> 31:05.034
"You either hack it, or you
pack it!" The great Santini.

31:06.137 --> 31:10.406
That's Jack's dad? Poor Jack.

31:10.408 --> 31:12.942
Poor me.

31:14.446 --> 31:17.547
Dude. Sorry. I think
I took your mouth guard.

31:18.617 --> 31:21.451
What? I got germs
or something?

31:26.491 --> 31:30.393
It's not my mouth, it's not
my mouth, it's not my mouth...

31:40.672 --> 31:44.240
We're stopping? But there's this
book I really need to read!

31:44.242 --> 31:48.611
I told you last night, honey. Dr.
Baker. For your team physical.

31:48.613 --> 31:51.147
Say what now, lady?

31:51.149 --> 31:53.650
Ok! Drills today,
rest day tomorrow,

31:53.652 --> 31:57.587
and then scrimmage against varsity
for the final tryouts on Sunday.

31:57.589 --> 32:00.089
Show me what you got!

32:26.084 --> 32:27.717
Ah!!

32:38.730 --> 32:41.297
Ow!!

32:41.299 --> 32:44.067
Hockey sticks, that's
a slam shot to the puck!

32:44.069 --> 32:46.469
Ah!!!

32:46.471 --> 32:48.071
Oh, letter b.

32:54.312 --> 32:56.412
Oh my gosh, dude,
that is so cold.

32:56.414 --> 33:00.516
Ok, Ellie, you can
take the mask off now.

33:06.091 --> 33:08.725
I just don't like looking
at needles or other things

33:08.727 --> 33:11.260
that aren't technically
my right to look at.

33:11.262 --> 33:14.097
Ooh! Sorry.

33:18.536 --> 33:21.104
You seem a little off.

33:21.106 --> 33:24.207
Your mom told me about
what's been going on.

33:24.743 --> 33:28.378
I know dad leaving was
rough. Losing a parent

33:28.380 --> 33:30.546
is so hard.

33:33.385 --> 33:35.752
Who exactly was I looking at
on that ice in there?

33:35.754 --> 33:38.721
Uh, just little old me, sir.

33:38.723 --> 33:41.457
Jack Malloy... sir.

33:41.459 --> 33:44.527
It's my own fault.
"Expecting is my greatest crime

33:44.529 --> 33:47.397
and disappointment is always
my punishment." Author unknown.

33:47.399 --> 33:49.799
- But not unwise.
- Look, sir,

33:49.801 --> 33:52.735
I know I totally blew it today,
but I'm really hoping

33:52.737 --> 33:55.705
I'm gonna be back to myself
soon. Like, really soon.

33:55.707 --> 33:58.808
I'm wondering if I should
even tell you this or not,

33:58.810 --> 34:01.110
but I can't tell if putting more
pressure on you is good or bad.

34:01.112 --> 34:03.546
Well, like, 99% of child
psychologists would say "bad".

34:03.548 --> 34:06.549
We're dedicating a bleacher seat
to your mother's memory on Sunday,

34:06.551 --> 34:08.684
since it's the one year
anniversary of...

34:08.686 --> 34:11.054
I would just rather avoid
the irony of her son

34:11.056 --> 34:13.376
blowing his chance for varsity
on the same day. You got me?

34:17.062 --> 34:19.695
You cut your hair.

34:19.697 --> 34:22.098
She always liked it long.

34:25.402 --> 34:29.172
But good choice. Good choice.

34:29.174 --> 34:31.741
It's better for us if
we just keep moving forward.

34:47.324 --> 34:50.827
I put the rejuvenating oils and
the relaxing salts in the bath.

34:50.829 --> 34:54.429
I also added some lavender bubble bath
and some rose petals for tranquillity.

34:54.431 --> 34:58.434
Lucky girl, you're gonna smell like
a bouquet of roses! I am so jelly!

34:58.436 --> 35:01.104
No way this dude's
doin' bubbles.

35:09.814 --> 35:13.816
Yo, Jacko! Your phone kept
ringing so I answered it!

35:13.818 --> 35:16.319
It's a giiiiiiirl.

35:23.261 --> 35:26.496
- Hello? -Kinda afraid to ask, but...
hockey tryouts?

35:26.498 --> 35:28.865
- Kinda afraid to answer.
- Aw, man.

35:28.867 --> 35:30.900
I don't wanna ask
about rhythmic practice,

35:30.902 --> 35:33.302
I'm not supposed to cry
in your body, remember?

35:33.304 --> 35:36.139
Ok, we just need to focus on
solutions here, so listen:

35:36.141 --> 35:38.674
"The ancients believed that
bestowing emotional power

35:38.676 --> 35:40.843
onto an object made it
a totem, with the ability

35:40.845 --> 35:43.312
- to cast spells or Grant
wishes." -Yeah, we get that.

35:43.314 --> 35:44.575
Get to the deciphering part.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.916
- You know, your mom's right.
You are controlling.

35:46.918 --> 35:48.748
You've already had a girl
talk with my mom about me?

35:48.772 --> 35:49.852
Oh, not just with your mom,

35:49.854 --> 35:52.688
but with Dr. Baker, too. Thanks for
the heads-up on that, by the way.

35:52.690 --> 35:55.291
Oh my gosh, my physical!
I completely forgot!

35:55.293 --> 35:57.760
Don't worry. My mother
taught me to be a gentleman.

36:00.765 --> 36:04.367
I'm so sorry
about your mom, Jack.

36:04.369 --> 36:06.836
They're having a dedication
for her on Sunday.

36:06.838 --> 36:09.739
Oh. Cool.

36:10.542 --> 36:13.342
And I'm sorry, too.

36:13.344 --> 36:15.511
About everything
with your dad...

36:15.513 --> 36:19.348
- Leaving.
- Thanks.

36:22.420 --> 36:25.955
- Ok, awkward silence acknowledged.
- And we're moving on.

36:25.957 --> 36:29.792
"They believed the spell was
binding unless a task or quest

36:29.794 --> 36:32.828
was undertaken to reverse it.
Often the quest is inherent

36:32.830 --> 36:34.864
in the original wish."

36:34.866 --> 36:36.933
So it is about our text wish,

36:36.935 --> 36:39.435
but I still don't know what
the heck the quest would be.

36:39.437 --> 36:42.972
- I think our quest's to make our
lives less messed up. -What?

36:42.974 --> 36:45.408
To make them better, I mean.
Because that's what we texted.

36:45.410 --> 36:48.945
That can't be it. I didn't wanna make your
life better, I wanted mine to not reek!

36:48.947 --> 36:52.615
Exactly! We wanted each others'
lives to make our own lives better,

36:52.617 --> 36:55.685
but I think the totems knew that we'd
have to help each other to do that.

36:56.888 --> 36:59.288
Dude. I am just not down
with totem logic.

36:59.290 --> 37:03.359
Oh! I didn't realize you were on the phone.
I'll just put your calming tea

37:03.361 --> 37:05.528
right here.

37:05.530 --> 37:09.732
I'm pretty sure that this is it, so just
tell me what I need to do to help you

37:09.734 --> 37:12.301
before the technology god shuts down
my totem and we're stuck forever.

37:12.303 --> 37:15.771
Ok, if we really need to De-stink
each others' lives, then first thing

37:15.773 --> 37:18.274
I'm doing tomorrow is trying to
get the phone contract extended.

37:18.276 --> 37:21.410
And the first thing you're doing is
getting Porter to delete that video.

37:21.412 --> 37:24.380
Wait, but Porter's expecting
my body, not yours!

37:24.382 --> 37:27.483
- What if he freaks out? -Well, then, run.
My body's way faster than his.

37:27.485 --> 37:30.686
Huh. Never thought I'd go on
my first date with hairy legs.

37:33.424 --> 37:35.925
- Why aren't you doing your pre-bed core?
- Exercise now?

37:36.894 --> 37:39.829
- I'm just gonna finish up
this phone call. -Oh yeah.

37:39.831 --> 37:43.899
Uh, sir? It's super important
that I communiqué right now.

37:43.901 --> 37:47.336
No distractions. You'll get this
back after tryouts on Sunday.

37:47.338 --> 37:51.007
- Sunday?!
- Sunday.

37:53.478 --> 37:55.444
Ok, what's the worst thing
that could happen?

37:55.446 --> 37:59.315
He confiscated the totem and I have
to start shopping for a prom dress?

38:04.389 --> 38:06.789
- Ah! Earthquake! Fire! What?

38:06.791 --> 38:09.759
Whoo! 5am, Jacky boy,
let's go!

38:09.761 --> 38:11.827
Let's get the undead
ready for the day!

38:11.829 --> 38:15.031
Let's go, early birds!
Time to yank some worms!

38:20.004 --> 38:23.039
Ugh. Yeah, still a boy.

38:43.961 --> 38:46.095
- Hit all of them.
- Ok.

38:47.065 --> 38:49.832
Hope you're having fun, Jack.

39:08.653 --> 39:10.853
Bro, no pressure, no diamonds!

39:10.855 --> 39:13.622
Come on, man, I'm not
going without you.

39:13.624 --> 39:16.559
C'mon, Jacko, if you don't
finish, we don't.

39:16.561 --> 39:19.628
You can do this, ok?
What did mom always say?

39:19.630 --> 39:22.131
"A bro is the best friend
you're ever gonna have",

39:22.133 --> 39:24.700
right? So come on!

39:24.702 --> 39:27.837
Alright, let's see
what this body can do.

39:30.975 --> 39:33.109
Woo!

39:33.111 --> 39:35.778
This testosterone stuff
is ridonkulous!

39:43.554 --> 39:46.622
Good warm-up. Three-miler
back home for lower body.

39:46.624 --> 39:49.792
Dead lifts, landmine reverse
lunges, sled pushes.

39:49.794 --> 39:53.062
"Legs feed the wolf."
Herb Brooks.

39:53.064 --> 39:55.931
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

39:55.933 --> 39:59.068
Wait. Warm-up?

40:08.479 --> 40:10.646
Still a girl.

40:21.492 --> 40:24.860
Ellie, I don't even wanna think about why
you're hanging out with Jack Malloy.

40:24.862 --> 40:28.564
Please tell me it's not because
of a backstabby conscience?

40:28.566 --> 40:30.800
Uh...

40:30.802 --> 40:34.003
Aspen has her theories,
but I say

40:34.005 --> 40:36.505
you were just trying
to be my wingwoman, right?

40:36.507 --> 40:40.042
Not swooping down on my fresh
boykill like a lady vulture?

40:40.044 --> 40:42.178
Oh,

40:42.180 --> 40:45.214
wait a minute. Look at you.

40:45.216 --> 40:47.450
What was I even thinking?

40:47.452 --> 40:50.085
Aspen must have just
heard wrong. Phew!

40:50.087 --> 40:54.123
Well, next time people are eavesdropping,
could you please try to speak more clearly?

40:54.125 --> 40:57.226
Oh, one last thing.

40:57.228 --> 41:00.763
And I'm totes saying this
for your own sake, El.

41:00.765 --> 41:04.533
At Claire's tonight, could you
just try to act like...

41:04.535 --> 41:06.602
Just...

41:06.604 --> 41:10.039
Don't be so... Ellie, ok?

41:13.110 --> 41:16.912
Don't be so Ellie.
Ok, that one I can promise.

41:18.883 --> 41:22.518
Whoa. I know that smell.

41:24.989 --> 41:27.590
Hey. Ready for banana bread?

41:27.592 --> 41:31.660
You make banana bread, too? "Two slices
of banana bread with a hug in the middle

41:31.662 --> 41:35.498
- makes a love sandwich." -Aw,
sweetie, that is such a cute saying.

41:35.500 --> 41:39.602
Well, the bread's in the
kitchen, but here's the hug!

41:39.604 --> 41:41.170
Aw...

41:42.940 --> 41:46.909
Uh, I gotta go do some stuff.

41:46.911 --> 41:49.578
You are tense, babe.

41:49.580 --> 41:53.649
Listen... I know that you're counting
on your dad to be at tomorrow's meet,

41:53.651 --> 41:55.885
but I don't want you to be
disappointed if he and...

41:55.887 --> 41:59.655
Felicia can't make it. Hm?

41:59.657 --> 42:02.224
Oh, and I have a surprise!

42:04.061 --> 42:06.295
Mommy-daughter spa day!

42:06.297 --> 42:09.298
- Yay...
- Can't wait.

42:11.035 --> 42:14.270
Hey, guys, I think I'm gonna
skip the workout today.

42:14.272 --> 42:16.772
I'm meeting someone for donuts.

42:16.774 --> 42:19.141
- You're messing with us, right?
- Your final tryout

42:19.143 --> 42:21.744
- is in tomorrow's scrimmage! -Trust me,
this donut is gonna help that cause

42:21.746 --> 42:24.713
way more than
a few dead body lifts.

42:27.184 --> 42:29.084
Bro!

42:29.086 --> 42:31.787
- What are you doing?!
- That's mom's closet!

42:31.789 --> 42:34.790
I totally knew that! I wasn't
trying to go out this door

42:34.792 --> 42:36.892
as if it was a real door.

42:36.894 --> 42:40.829
It's obviously right there.

42:40.831 --> 42:43.799
I was just checking to make
sure everything is still here.

43:00.918 --> 43:04.286
Soon as you made varsity, she'd 'a
had a shirt made for you, too, bro.

43:12.597 --> 43:15.164
Ooh, "queen for a day"!

43:15.166 --> 43:18.067
Or "sweet baby girl deluxe"?

43:18.069 --> 43:21.103
Uh, you choose. They both
sound equally terrifying.

43:21.105 --> 43:22.104
Hm?

43:22.106 --> 43:25.841
Uh, terrifying... Ly
awesome!

43:27.011 --> 43:30.079
Mom? Do I got a sec to run
an errand across the street?

43:30.081 --> 43:34.316
Oh, there'll be time after. Queen for a
day is actually only half a day long!

43:34.819 --> 43:36.952
We'll be queens for the day.

43:52.970 --> 43:56.739
Malloy? I had me a date with
tracksuit, not with you!

43:56.741 --> 43:58.107
Totally showing coach the video!

43:58.109 --> 43:59.708
Wait, wait! I mean...

43:59.710 --> 44:02.411
Can we just talk
things out? Man to...

44:02.413 --> 44:05.648
Me? Just let me try
to make things better.

44:05.650 --> 44:08.751
How? You gonna drop out so
I get the last varsity spot?

44:08.753 --> 44:11.754
Well, I'm open to hearing
your feelings on the subject.

44:11.756 --> 44:15.190
You rode all the way here
on your funky scooter,

44:15.192 --> 44:17.092
you might as well get
your donuts, right?

44:18.396 --> 44:22.031
Well, ok. But I'm not
giving you my freebie.

44:22.033 --> 44:24.967
That's right,
ladies first, Malloy.

44:26.871 --> 44:30.973
Ah! Ha, ha, ha!
Wait! No, no,

44:30.975 --> 44:33.909
stop! Lady, stop it!
Stop it! Ok.

44:33.911 --> 44:36.945
Ok, I'm good. Ah!!

44:36.947 --> 44:40.082
Mercy! Mercy!

44:40.818 --> 44:42.951
Whoaaaa...

44:42.953 --> 44:45.220
So this is relaxation.

44:47.358 --> 44:50.993
Ooh, that tingles.
Is this another treatment?

44:50.995 --> 44:54.730
Honey, you act like you've never
had your legs waxed before.

44:54.732 --> 44:57.733
Huh?

45:01.872 --> 45:03.739
This has been going on
for four years now.

45:03.741 --> 45:05.741
First your stupid brothers,
and now you wanna take my spot?

45:05.743 --> 45:10.179
It's like the Hatfields and
Mccoys except I'm not a Hatfield

45:10.181 --> 45:13.248
and it's Malloy, not McCoy.
But otherwise,

45:13.250 --> 45:15.984
- exactly the same.
- Porter, question:

45:15.986 --> 45:18.420
Do you really like hockey?

45:18.422 --> 45:21.023
Do you really love to play,
or do you just wanna be able

45:21.025 --> 45:24.793
- to say you made the team?
- What's the difference? -Ok,

45:24.795 --> 45:28.931
you could show the video to coach and
maybe get a spot on varsity, but...

45:28.933 --> 45:30.531
How's that gonna
change your life?

45:30.556 --> 45:32.768
You gotta find out what
makes your heart happy,

45:32.770 --> 45:36.772
and stop trying to be something
or someone that you're not.

45:36.774 --> 45:39.508
- But hockey's the only thing I'm good at.
- Well, you have been trying

45:39.510 --> 45:42.377
to make the team
for four years, so...

45:42.379 --> 45:47.282
Oh. Right.
Well, that stinks.

45:47.284 --> 45:49.918
Guess I'm not good
at anything, then.

45:49.920 --> 45:52.454
My whole life is a lie!

45:52.456 --> 45:54.757
Who even am I?

46:01.966 --> 46:06.368
That's a pretty cool contraption. I
want you to check something out.

46:12.977 --> 46:16.178
Ok. I'll check out
this stem club thingy,

46:16.180 --> 46:19.214
but if I don't like it,
I'm taking you down, Malloy,

46:19.216 --> 46:23.185
down town, to video town.

46:23.187 --> 46:25.220
Do you get it?

46:25.222 --> 46:29.324
- 'Cause of the video I took.
- Yep, I got it. Fair enough.

46:37.101 --> 46:41.336
Mack! I totally forgot that
you're a science rock star!

46:41.338 --> 46:44.439
That's so awesome.
- You know me?

46:44.441 --> 46:48.243
- What? Oh! Right.
- You're Jack Malloy, aren't you?

46:48.245 --> 46:52.314
Yes! Yes, I'm Jack Malloy.

46:52.316 --> 46:54.983
All boy ever since I was born.

47:20.511 --> 47:24.279
Not to be rude, mister,
but I'm kinda in a rush.

47:24.281 --> 47:27.149
How can we can extend this
contract, like, right now?

47:27.151 --> 47:30.252
- Ugh!

47:30.254 --> 47:33.255
Oh, don't worry,
that's just algae.

47:33.257 --> 47:36.491
See?

47:36.493 --> 47:39.561
Alright, well, I'm sorry,
I can't extend the plan.

47:39.563 --> 47:43.932
It wasn't your mom who canceled
it; It was your dad. Here, look.

47:48.205 --> 47:51.273
They can't even extend the
service for, like, a day?!

47:51.275 --> 47:53.542
Why did my mom
have to cancel it?!

47:53.544 --> 47:58.046
No, it wasn't, uh,
look, it's complicated,

47:58.048 --> 48:00.549
I'll explain later. You gotta
gimme something else to do

48:00.551 --> 48:04.086
to make your life better. Besides getting
body hair ripped out by the roots.

48:04.088 --> 48:07.155
- Dude, I can't believe I thought you
had it easier. -Hello! I told you!

48:07.157 --> 48:11.593
Look, I really need you to go to Claire's
party tonight and fix stuff with sassy.

48:11.595 --> 48:14.529
She's my best friend and I
cannot lose her right now.

48:14.531 --> 48:17.232
- I need you to be a guy tonight.
- What you talking 'bout?

48:17.234 --> 48:21.370
Jack Malloy's cool and popular.
So just be you being me,

48:21.372 --> 48:24.339
and Sassy'll know that I can
fit in, that I'm not a...

48:24.341 --> 48:28.443
- Buzzkiller of uncoolness.
- Is that what she thinks?

48:28.445 --> 48:30.479
Why do you wanna be friends
with this chick anyway?!

48:30.481 --> 48:34.016
You asked me what would make my
life better, so don't be judge-y.

48:34.018 --> 48:36.084
A girl needs her BFF.

48:37.988 --> 48:40.322
Whoa! Gotta go!

48:44.295 --> 48:47.462
- Thanks, mack. -No problem.
- I had a lot of fun

48:47.464 --> 48:50.065
hanging out with you today.
I honestly don't know

48:50.067 --> 48:52.267
why we didn't do this before.

49:07.518 --> 49:11.420
I want it to be ash blond,
not ashy blond.

49:11.422 --> 49:16.224
- I need to look ultra-cool tonight.
Like, ah-may-zing. -Yes, I understand.

49:16.226 --> 49:20.028
No way, are you French?!
I'm going to a Paris-themed

49:20.030 --> 49:23.131
- party tonight! -I'm sure
it will be very authentic.

49:23.133 --> 49:27.536
Oh, mais oui! It's gonna be
très chic! Well,

49:27.538 --> 49:31.206
except for my Bestie's
tragic ex-BFF. This girl

49:31.208 --> 49:34.509
would wear gym shorts on the red carpet.
She hasn't moved on since 5th grade's

49:34.511 --> 49:39.181
"moving on"! Ellie Dommage! -I'll
get your color. I'll be right back.

49:48.726 --> 49:52.227
- I am right back!
- Oh! That was quick.

49:52.229 --> 49:55.397
So, zis Ellie of tragedy...

49:55.399 --> 49:58.300
She has been ex-bff'ed, you say?

49:58.302 --> 50:01.036
Well, if she doesn't step up her
game by tonight, she will be.

50:01.038 --> 50:03.538
Which, b-t-dubs,
is totally fine with me,

50:03.540 --> 50:06.441
'cause I am from New York
and we don't do

50:06.443 --> 50:09.778
third wheelationships. You know
what I mean, big city sista?

50:09.780 --> 50:12.514
Holla! Ew!

50:16.787 --> 50:20.188
This is very relaxing.

50:22.459 --> 50:25.260
- Hey, honey! Where did you go?
- Mom, after the spa,

50:25.262 --> 50:27.262
can I get, like, a makeover
and some new clothes?

50:27.264 --> 50:30.399
I need to look ah-may-zing
tonight for Claire's party.

50:30.401 --> 50:34.770
Are you kidding me? You want something new?
Let's do it, babe!

50:35.739 --> 50:38.774
Cool.

50:40.644 --> 50:43.045
Must be another leg waxer.

50:48.318 --> 50:50.752
There's the mystery man!

50:50.754 --> 50:53.288
I was worried about you,
bromegranate juice.

50:53.290 --> 50:57.092
You always Nancy out before a big game, but
dude, I've never seen you like this before.

50:57.094 --> 51:01.129
"Nancy out"? Oh, like nervous
Nancy? So I stress out a lot?

51:01.131 --> 51:03.432
Does a Zamboni
have 4-wheel drive?

51:03.434 --> 51:06.768
Yeah, so I should help him

51:06.770 --> 51:09.371
myself relieve the stress.

51:09.373 --> 51:11.359
Maybe relax and goof
around for a little while?

51:11.384 --> 51:12.641
Don't bother convincing us

51:12.643 --> 51:16.311
you need to go to Owen's game night.
Coach'll have you hitting hay by sunset.

51:16.313 --> 51:19.548
- Game night? It's perfect!
- Malloy!

51:21.185 --> 51:25.353
It's alright, guys.
I got this. I think.

51:34.765 --> 51:37.099
You were right.

51:38.302 --> 51:41.103
I found the answer to my heart's
question: I'm an engineer!

51:42.139 --> 51:44.539
Not like on a train.
Like designing stuff.

51:44.541 --> 51:47.342
Oh, that's awesome!

51:47.344 --> 51:50.212
Is your scooter running on soda?

51:50.214 --> 51:53.281
Pretty sick, huh? Hey,

51:53.283 --> 51:57.886
I owe you big time. Seriously.
Call me for whatever.

52:00.424 --> 52:03.859
It's gone, just like my
confusion over life choices.

52:03.861 --> 52:06.128
You did that for me, Malloy.

52:07.564 --> 52:10.398
You did.

52:16.807 --> 52:21.376
Did Porter Gibbs just give you
a double back tap bro hug?

52:22.279 --> 52:26.448
- Yes, he did. -Life's sure getting
better for you, huh, Jacko?

52:27.885 --> 52:30.252
Yes, it is.

54:13.323 --> 54:17.025
Man, chicks know
how to throw it down.

54:20.631 --> 54:23.698
- Hey, Portster.

54:31.475 --> 54:33.608
Ha! Science.

54:49.459 --> 54:51.760
- Thanks, Porter.
- It's the least I can do

54:51.762 --> 54:54.596
for the dude that helped
align me with my infinite self.

54:54.598 --> 54:56.931
Now go, shoot up some zombies

54:56.933 --> 54:59.701
with your... friends.

55:02.005 --> 55:04.806
I got some friends too
I gotta go, you know.

55:04.808 --> 55:08.376
I have this one friend, he's at the
grocery store. We're pretty tight.

55:08.378 --> 55:12.914
He works there, but it's just...
It's still cool, he's cool with it.

55:12.916 --> 55:16.084
I got that going on tonight,

55:16.086 --> 55:20.088
- so I'm pretty busy, but...
- Ok, ok. I get it.

55:23.093 --> 55:27.362
- Follow me, follow me.

55:27.364 --> 55:31.366
Ok, it's probably gonna be
weird for you at first.

55:31.368 --> 55:32.763
Definitely gonna
be weird for me.

55:32.788 --> 55:35.103
The politics of introducing
someone into a friend group

55:35.105 --> 55:38.473
are extremely complicated,
so let me try.

55:38.475 --> 55:41.509
Jackpack, you made it!
Oh, is Porter with you?

55:41.511 --> 55:44.813
- Yes, but let me explain.
- Cool. Pizza?

55:44.815 --> 55:47.382
Yeah, don't mind if I do.

55:58.962 --> 56:02.530
Wow! You look amazeadorable!

56:02.532 --> 56:04.632
Ellie? Is that you?

56:04.634 --> 56:07.902
What's with
the extreme makeover?

56:07.904 --> 56:10.605
I... uh...

56:10.607 --> 56:14.376
Muh... muh... uh...

56:15.112 --> 56:16.611
Um...

56:16.613 --> 56:19.114
See, sass, I told you
it wasn't a rumor.

56:19.116 --> 56:22.884
It was a trumor! You don't think she
un-ponytailed herself for us, do you?

56:23.787 --> 56:26.521
- No, it was for him.
- Ellie?

56:26.523 --> 56:29.557
Deny it if it's not true!

56:29.559 --> 56:31.159
You know how much
he means to me!

56:31.161 --> 56:34.462
Ever since, like, yesterday,
he's been my number one choice

56:34.464 --> 56:36.798
for sophomore boyfriend!
How could you?! -Wait!

56:37.901 --> 56:41.669
Ok, let's let 'em talk.
By the way, nice hat.

56:41.671 --> 56:44.005
- Not cliché at all.
- Oh, Merci!

56:44.007 --> 56:47.108
- So, are you gonna admit it?
- I don't even get it!

56:47.110 --> 56:50.879
Trumors, rumors...
Can we just, like...

56:50.881 --> 56:53.081
Can we just be cool?

56:54.551 --> 56:56.885
So you want things to go back
to the way they were before?

56:56.887 --> 57:01.656
Like, pinball in my garage, sleepovers on
Saturdays, and watching old VHS tapes?

57:01.658 --> 57:06.728
- Yes! That! We good? -El, I'm
just not into that stuff anymore.

57:06.730 --> 57:09.864
We're sophomores now.
You know, Aspen's right.

57:09.866 --> 57:12.901
You're just not
the kind of friend

57:12.903 --> 57:15.103
that's bestie for me anymore.

57:25.449 --> 57:27.715
Hey, El. Let's go dance.

58:04.054 --> 58:06.621
- Yeah, take that!

58:07.724 --> 58:09.190
Pass me another slice,
dung brains?

58:13.163 --> 58:16.598
Dudealude.
You're eating carbs.

58:16.600 --> 58:20.001
And grease. I haven't
seen you like this in...

58:20.003 --> 58:22.103
Well, I've never
seen you like this.

58:22.105 --> 58:25.807
Isn't that just wrong?
Look, discipline is great,

58:25.809 --> 58:29.043
but sometimes a kid's gotta have some pizza
and chips, know what I mean? So tonight

58:29.045 --> 58:31.513
I'll be doing no
kettlebells, no deadlifts,

58:31.515 --> 58:34.148
and the only burpees I'm
gonna be doing are these.

58:34.150 --> 58:37.685
- Nice.

58:37.687 --> 58:39.654
Alright, man.

58:39.656 --> 58:42.857
Gimme this.

58:46.897 --> 58:48.796
Hey look, a perfume bar!

58:48.798 --> 58:53.034
Awesome! Like, seriously?
You get to make your own smell?

58:53.036 --> 58:55.970
Man, this would totally cover
the fart wars at my house.

58:55.972 --> 58:58.640
You have fart wars
at your house?

58:58.642 --> 59:01.743
Yeah, you know,

59:01.745 --> 59:05.113
- me and my mom, fart-warring it up.
- I love it.

59:06.850 --> 59:10.018
I saw you were having some trouble
talking to sassy back there, huh?

59:10.020 --> 59:13.988
Yeah. Not that I get half of what they're
saying. I mean, "Trumors", "girl code"...

59:13.990 --> 59:16.257
Yeah, that. Well,
Aspen started this rumor

59:16.259 --> 59:18.760
that you're trying to steal
Jack Malloy away from sassy.

59:18.762 --> 59:21.596
Seriously? That's what
they've been babbling about?

59:21.598 --> 59:24.232
Well, guess what?
He's not hers to steal!

59:24.234 --> 59:27.569
Oh, good! I mean,
I didn't think so.

59:27.571 --> 59:31.139
Ok, you know what?
I made a promise to... to me,

59:31.141 --> 59:35.043
that I would make things better with sassy.
But what if "better" means without sassy?

59:35.045 --> 59:37.912
I mean, there's more than
one BFF in the sea, right?

59:40.083 --> 59:44.619
So I don't hang out and play
video games, I don't eat pizza.

59:44.621 --> 59:47.855
What else don't I do? You know,
from your perspective as a friend.

59:47.857 --> 59:52.327
Huh. Well, aside from standing up
to the coach, which, let's face it,

59:52.329 --> 59:56.064
is not gonna happen, I guess
the biggest thing would be...

59:56.066 --> 59:59.267
- Well, you know.
- Yeah,

59:59.269 --> 01:00:02.904
of course I know. I don't...

01:00:02.906 --> 01:00:06.841
- I always... I...
- You got no game.

01:00:06.843 --> 01:00:11.679
I got no game! Wait. What? I'm this cool of
a kid and I have trouble talking to girls?

01:00:11.681 --> 01:00:15.316
Do all of you guys know I have
trouble talking to girls?

01:00:15.318 --> 01:00:18.219
- Yeah, bro. -Even I have
better game than you.

01:00:18.221 --> 01:00:20.221
And I got chronic halitosis.

01:00:20.223 --> 01:00:22.757
Well, let's talk about this.

01:00:22.759 --> 01:00:25.793
- What can I do to beat it? -I
think I know how. -Really??

01:00:25.795 --> 01:00:27.795
Well, spill, girl! I mean,

01:00:27.797 --> 01:00:30.798
spill about girls, mister.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.301
Alright, well,

01:00:33.303 --> 01:00:36.871
the only people you ever
have around you are...

01:00:36.873 --> 01:00:41.376
Guys. Maybe you need to have,
like, a girl who's a friend,

01:00:41.378 --> 01:00:46.948
before you ever have
a girl... Friend. Maybe.

01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:51.119
Bro, are your two initials
y and y?

01:00:51.121 --> 01:00:54.856
Because you are too wise,
too wise, my friend.

01:00:56.059 --> 01:00:59.160
- Blowing my mind.
- I like this guy.

01:00:59.162 --> 01:01:01.963
This is so boring.

01:01:05.001 --> 01:01:08.703
"Joie De vivre" at
a party with no boys?

01:01:08.705 --> 01:01:11.039
Please. I'd get some "Joie"

01:01:11.041 --> 01:01:13.408
if we could "leave"
this horror show.

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:15.443
Quick, follow me.

01:01:17.013 --> 01:01:19.747
Ooh! Ooh!

01:01:22.452 --> 01:01:26.387
- Oh, that's a good one.

01:01:27.724 --> 01:01:30.792
I love it!

01:01:30.794 --> 01:01:33.227
Look at that.

01:01:35.098 --> 01:01:38.166
Oh, my god! Genius.

01:01:38.168 --> 01:01:41.235
Hey, sassy, Aspen!

01:01:41.237 --> 01:01:44.138
Take that down!
You're ruining everything!

01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:47.942
Hey, what are you two doing? You
know you're being totally uncool.

01:01:47.944 --> 01:01:50.878
Yeah, well, you would know "totally
uncool", El, that's your specialty.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.716
- Oh, come on, Ellie,
take a joke. It's funny.

01:01:54.718 --> 01:01:59.454
Ok. You know who wouldn't think it's funny?
Jack Malloy.

01:02:00.757 --> 01:02:05.093
That's right. He and I are tight. Like,
so-tight-I-know-his-thoughts, tight!

01:02:05.095 --> 01:02:07.195
Like tighty-whitey tight!

01:02:08.198 --> 01:02:12.233
- Ok, maybe not that. That's weird.
- Yeah.

01:02:12.235 --> 01:02:15.837
Wait. It's one thing for you
to be going after him,

01:02:15.839 --> 01:02:19.207
but you're saying he's into
you, too? This I gotta see.

01:02:19.209 --> 01:02:21.876
I think it's time
for a little excursion.

01:02:24.514 --> 01:02:29.984
There's no way she's a 7, she's a 5 at
most. But that new girl, Aspen? She's a 9

01:02:29.986 --> 01:02:33.121
- verging on a 10. -Come on, it's so
not cool to reduce girls to numbers.

01:02:33.123 --> 01:02:35.523
What about sassy Gayles? She's
a total smoke show now!

01:02:35.525 --> 01:02:39.227
Nah, she wears way too much makeup.
And she's kind of a fake.

01:02:39.229 --> 01:02:42.363
We grew up on the same street and
she won't even talk to me anymore.

01:02:42.365 --> 01:02:44.966
But what do you think about her friend?
The one with the ponytail?

01:02:44.968 --> 01:02:47.335
Tracksuit! Now we're talking.

01:02:47.337 --> 01:02:50.404
Ellie, I think her name is.

01:02:50.406 --> 01:02:54.375
I don't know, guys, there's something
about her. She's real, ya know?

01:02:54.377 --> 01:02:57.145
Plus she's so hot.

01:03:08.525 --> 01:03:12.460
Dude, you been
holding out on us?

01:03:12.462 --> 01:03:16.063
No. Yes. I don't know.

01:03:21.171 --> 01:03:23.271
Whoa! I'm like... kinda pretty.

01:03:23.273 --> 01:03:26.307
Oh right, my hair.

01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:30.378
Uh... looks awesome in the wind!

01:03:32.415 --> 01:03:36.117
- What the heck is going on?
- Kiss me.

01:03:36.119 --> 01:03:39.987
- What?!
- Shh! Oh, Jackie, you flirt!

01:03:39.989 --> 01:03:43.157
Of course I'll walk to the bridge
with you so we can be alone!

01:03:47.597 --> 01:03:50.565
- Oh my gosh!
- What are they doing?

01:03:51.968 --> 01:03:54.135
What is going on with these two?

01:03:56.172 --> 01:03:59.941
Ok, don't freak, but I kinda made
everybody think that you liked me.

01:03:59.943 --> 01:04:02.310
- Well, that I liked you.
- What?! Why?!

01:04:02.312 --> 01:04:05.413
- 'Cause you told me to make you
cool and popular! -Yeah, but only

01:04:05.415 --> 01:04:08.850
so I could get sassy back! Don't you get
it? This is major girl code violation!

01:04:08.852 --> 01:04:12.587
Girl code is just like bro code?
But bros have your back!

01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:15.523
- This girl is stabbing you in the back!
- Ugh, you're such a guy!

01:04:15.525 --> 01:04:19.861
Look, if we don't lock lips,
everyone's gonna think you're a liar.

01:04:19.863 --> 01:04:22.630
And if we do, I'm a traitor.
Great! You had one job,

01:04:22.632 --> 01:04:25.299
to get my BFF back,
and you screwed it up!

01:04:25.301 --> 01:04:26.118
This is hopeless!

01:04:26.143 --> 01:04:28.569
The last day of hockey tryouts are
tomorrow and we're not gonna switch back!

01:04:28.571 --> 01:04:32.006
- My life is over! -Aagh! I can't
even look at my face right now!

01:04:32.008 --> 01:04:35.309
Yeah? Well, I. Make. Me. Sick!

01:04:39.315 --> 01:04:41.949
- Wait! El, you're leaving?
- Yeah.

01:04:41.951 --> 01:04:45.987
She's gotta get home before midnight, otherwise
her dress is gonna turn back into a leotard!

01:04:45.989 --> 01:04:51.158
Ok, normally I wouldn't call a girl out,
but you know what? Come at me, gymnasty!

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.095
Uh-oh, girl fight!
My money's on you, tracksuit.

01:04:54.097 --> 01:04:56.631
- Thanks, Porty.
- Oh, Jack, don't do it.

01:04:56.633 --> 01:05:00.568
- You deal with her, she's your
ex-BFF, not mine! -Ellie,

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:04.305
don't be such a guy
about this, ok?

01:05:04.307 --> 01:05:06.374
You wanna be friends again
like you asked before?

01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:10.311
'K, we're friends. Good?

01:05:10.313 --> 01:05:13.648
Are you kidding?
You don't know anything

01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:17.585
about friendship, sassy. All it took was
for someone shinier to come to town

01:05:17.587 --> 01:05:20.621
and you dropped El... me
like yesterday's garbage.

01:05:23.626 --> 01:05:27.528
You know, I guess
I should thank Aspen.

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:30.164
It's because of her that
you showed your true colors.

01:05:30.166 --> 01:05:33.467
And speaking of true colors...

01:05:33.469 --> 01:05:37.204
- No!

01:05:37.206 --> 01:05:39.607
"Freak just keeps
getting freakier!"

01:05:44.113 --> 01:05:47.415
- No, he's ruining everything!
- Ellie, are you ok?

01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:50.718
I've never seen you do
something like that before.

01:05:56.159 --> 01:05:58.225
Jack!

01:05:58.227 --> 01:06:01.195
Jack Malloy! Where are you?

01:06:03.433 --> 01:06:07.201
"Honesty is the first chapter
in the book of wisdom!"

01:06:07.203 --> 01:06:10.371
- Thomas Jefferson.
- Seriously?

01:06:15.411 --> 01:06:18.980
- Don't do it.

01:06:21.517 --> 01:06:23.217
Don't you do it.

01:06:31.127 --> 01:06:33.694
What are you...
No, no, no.

01:06:33.696 --> 01:06:36.530
Boys don't cry!

01:06:36.532 --> 01:06:40.167
It's allergies.
Sand in my eyes, coach.

01:06:40.169 --> 01:06:43.004
They don't cry.

01:06:53.149 --> 01:06:55.716
You need to take
a long look in the mirror

01:06:55.718 --> 01:06:58.352
and think hard about how you're
gonna redeem yourself tomorrow.

01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:05.493
Oh, you took stuff
out of her closet.

01:07:08.798 --> 01:07:11.232
That's all. Good night.

01:07:18.474 --> 01:07:20.608
Oh hey, El-bell,
how was the party?

01:07:20.610 --> 01:07:23.744
Ok.

01:07:42.331 --> 01:07:46.133
Seriously, Ellie, why sassy?

01:08:03.119 --> 01:08:05.753
Come on, let's go.

01:08:32.814 --> 01:08:36.484
Ah, she can't lose them both.

01:08:40.256 --> 01:08:42.490
I'm such a doofus.

01:08:42.492 --> 01:08:44.825
"Jack's goals.

01:08:44.827 --> 01:08:47.461
Number one, make varsity.

01:08:47.462 --> 01:08:50.831
Number two, play
for Boston college.

01:08:50.832 --> 01:08:54.167
Number three,
get drafted by the NHL.

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:58.171
Number four, thank my mom
when I win the Stanley cup.

01:08:58.174 --> 01:09:01.609
Signed Jack Malloy.

01:09:01.611 --> 01:09:03.911
Witnessed by Linda Malloy".

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:39.712
So, one more time.
You made your phones

01:09:39.715 --> 01:09:41.715
into magic wands

01:09:41.716 --> 01:09:44.585
and shazamed your souls
into each others' bodies?

01:09:45.188 --> 01:09:47.587
Do I gotta burp "the pledge of
allegiance" again to prove it?

01:09:47.756 --> 01:09:49.890
I pledge allegiance.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.727
Ok, ok, I'm convinced. And you're
sure this is the way to get back?

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:57.298
It's the last way we can think of
to make each others' lives better.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.667
Do you really think we can
get our bodies to cooperate?

01:09:59.669 --> 01:10:01.835
It's in our muscles, believe me.

01:10:01.837 --> 01:10:04.438
When I ran this morning I was able
to tap into your body's power.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.975
- You can do the same with mine.
- I don't know. -Here, watch.

01:10:09.679 --> 01:10:11.579
Ok then.

01:10:11.581 --> 01:10:17.218
All I've gotta do is teach you the gymnastics
routine, and you teach me the hockey rules!

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.286
Let's go.

01:11:15.745 --> 01:11:19.747
Yep! I'm here. I got up early and
didn't come from anywhere else!

01:11:19.749 --> 01:11:22.750
Dude! You are nails, Jacko!

01:11:31.994 --> 01:11:35.529
- Oh good, you're up!
- I'm up!

01:11:35.531 --> 01:11:39.767
- I'm definitely up! -Great! Your
spirulina smoothie is almost ready.

01:11:39.769 --> 01:11:42.036
I'll add a little ginseng.

01:12:01.524 --> 01:12:04.491
Uh, have I mentioned
how bizarre all this is?

01:12:04.493 --> 01:12:08.462
Dude, I'm rockin' a leotard and body
glitter. You don't have to tell me.

01:12:08.464 --> 01:12:10.764
Is Ellie's dad here?

01:12:12.034 --> 01:12:14.501
No-show.

01:12:14.503 --> 01:12:16.870
Poor Ellie.

01:12:16.872 --> 01:12:20.774
You know, if you wanna sneak over to
the rink for your mom's ceremony.

01:12:20.776 --> 01:12:24.078
- It's ok. I don't need to.
- You sure? There's enough time.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.047
I don't want to, ok?
I'm sorry,

01:12:27.049 --> 01:12:31.585
I'm just... I just really need to focus.
If we don't fulfill this quest by noon,

01:12:31.587 --> 01:12:34.067
you'll have to ask me
to the homecoming dance.

01:12:34.092 --> 01:12:35.146
Better nail it.

01:12:35.991 --> 01:12:38.425
I will, dork trap.

01:12:39.662 --> 01:12:41.895
Ellie.

01:12:45.868 --> 01:12:50.471
She just really loved the game. And not
just 'cause her kids ruled the ice.

01:12:50.473 --> 01:12:52.740
We miss you, mom.

01:12:52.742 --> 01:12:55.542
And now your spirit
will always be here.

01:13:04.487 --> 01:13:08.622
Alright, ladies.
As individuals we shine,

01:13:08.624 --> 01:13:11.425
but we are a team
first and foremost.

01:13:11.427 --> 01:13:14.528
By the end of the day, if we've
done our job right, there'll be

01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:19.733
some weepy badminton players out there,
alright? So let's kick some birdie!!

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:24.638
'Cause that's the little flying
thing they use in badminton.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.741
Let's kick some birdie! Like...

01:13:27.743 --> 01:13:32.846
This is where you join me. Here we go.
Let's kick some birdie!

01:13:32.848 --> 01:13:35.182
Next, Ellie O'brien.

01:13:48.464 --> 01:13:52.099
Ok, it's scrimmage against
varsity, four on four.

01:13:52.101 --> 01:13:55.869
Your body's got this. You're
gonna get hit. You may go down.

01:13:55.871 --> 01:13:59.706
- But the key is to recover, ok?
- Got it.

01:15:33.068 --> 01:15:34.868
Yeah!!

01:15:35.671 --> 01:15:37.538
Yeah!

01:15:42.077 --> 01:15:44.978
Welcome to varsity, Malloy!

01:15:50.119 --> 01:15:51.818
Amazing, Ellie, you did it!

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:54.288
Your team's still a sport!

01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:56.757
We dominated 'em!
What about me?

01:15:56.759 --> 01:15:59.927
Well, it wasn't pretty, but you can
check number one off your list!

01:15:59.929 --> 01:16:01.828
Varsity!

01:16:03.032 --> 01:16:05.666
Ok... moment of truth...

01:16:05.668 --> 01:16:08.068
It's 11:15, there's
only 45 minutes left.

01:16:16.145 --> 01:16:19.012
No! What happened?
Why didn't it work?!

01:16:19.014 --> 01:16:21.582
I dunno! Maybe we got attached
to each others' totems?

01:16:21.584 --> 01:16:23.650
Switch!

01:16:27.089 --> 01:16:29.323
- There's gotta be something else!
- What else could there be?

01:16:29.325 --> 01:16:33.160
- We've tried everything! -We gotta tell
the truth! We find my mom, tell her

01:16:33.162 --> 01:16:35.103
what's really going on and
she'll extend the contract.

01:16:35.127 --> 01:16:36.196
No, that's not gonna work.

01:16:36.198 --> 01:16:38.732
Owen believed us,
so she will too!

01:16:38.734 --> 01:16:41.868
- We need that extra time!
- Ellie! It wasn't her!

01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:45.706
Your mom didn't pull
the plug on your totem.

01:16:45.708 --> 01:16:49.042
She was just covering
for your dad. It was him.

01:16:49.044 --> 01:16:51.178
He wanted...

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:53.814
A new family plan.

01:16:53.816 --> 01:16:56.850
Why would he want a...

01:16:57.786 --> 01:17:00.020
Oh.

01:17:00.022 --> 01:17:02.356
For his new family.

01:17:04.093 --> 01:17:06.960
Maybe you could try calling your
dad and telling him the truth?

01:17:06.962 --> 01:17:09.607
Then maybe he can call
the phone company and...

01:17:09.632 --> 01:17:10.764
he won't answer.

01:17:10.766 --> 01:17:14.067
That's what he does when he's
embarrassed about not showing up.

01:17:15.404 --> 01:17:17.938
What are you doing here?
Let's go.

01:17:20.409 --> 01:17:24.111
Jack. I don't repeat myself.

01:17:25.347 --> 01:17:28.015
I'm so sorry, Ellie.

01:17:28.017 --> 01:17:30.817
Me too, Jack.

01:17:52.074 --> 01:17:55.042
You happy with how
you played today?

01:17:55.044 --> 01:17:57.978
Uh, I made varsity, sir.

01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:02.282
Yeah. Barely. And only because
everyone else played worse.

01:18:04.219 --> 01:18:06.386
Wow.

01:18:06.388 --> 01:18:10.257
Do you know how that makes
a kid feel, to hear that?

01:18:10.259 --> 01:18:13.960
You see, that's your problem. If
you can't handle the corners,

01:18:13.962 --> 01:18:16.997
if you can't be a man
and be mentally tough,

01:18:16.999 --> 01:18:20.734
you open yourself up to weakness. Your
emotions can step in and knock you

01:18:20.736 --> 01:18:23.370
to the ground.

01:18:28.444 --> 01:18:32.345
That's it.
Enough is enough.

01:18:36.452 --> 01:18:39.820
You were outstanding
today, love.

01:18:41.890 --> 01:18:44.825
So, I think I know
what's going on.

01:18:44.827 --> 01:18:46.760
Doubt it.

01:18:46.762 --> 01:18:49.730
Someone wasn't there today
who should have been.

01:18:49.732 --> 01:18:53.033
When someone who supported you
and was there for you

01:18:53.035 --> 01:18:55.335
all those years
is suddenly just gone.

01:18:55.337 --> 01:18:58.171
- I really don't wanna talk about it.
- You have to deal with the loss.

01:18:58.173 --> 01:19:00.507
- I'm fine!
- You're not fine.

01:19:00.509 --> 01:19:03.110
You've been holding
this inside forever,

01:19:03.112 --> 01:19:07.848
and your dad not showing up today
is a chance for you to let it out.

01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:10.217
Sometimes we miss
people so much,

01:19:10.219 --> 01:19:13.854
we think it's beyond
words, but it's not.

01:19:14.857 --> 01:19:18.125
She always wanted to talk.

01:19:20.162 --> 01:19:23.063
I miss her. I miss my mom.

01:19:23.065 --> 01:19:25.866
- I miss her so much!
- Oh, sweetie!

01:19:25.868 --> 01:19:30.003
It's ok. I am right here.
You never have to miss me.

01:19:30.005 --> 01:19:34.775
I'll always be with you, even
if I'm not right beside you.

01:19:55.931 --> 01:19:58.799
What is wrong with you?!

01:19:58.801 --> 01:20:02.135
Do you even love me at all?

01:20:02.137 --> 01:20:05.372
Because I hate to break it to you, but this
is not the way you treat the people you love!

01:20:05.374 --> 01:20:08.542
Jack. This conversation is over.

01:20:08.544 --> 01:20:12.445
No! No, you don't get
to walk away anymore!

01:20:13.482 --> 01:20:16.149
You hurt me.

01:20:16.151 --> 01:20:20.020
You hurt me a lot, and you're just
gonna have to stand there and deal!

01:20:24.326 --> 01:20:26.960
I counted on my dad
for everything.

01:20:26.962 --> 01:20:29.196
To just be there for me.

01:20:31.166 --> 01:20:33.233
Now I'm moving on,

01:20:33.235 --> 01:20:35.869
with or without a dad
who loves me.

01:20:42.511 --> 01:20:44.578
And boys can too cry!

01:20:46.481 --> 01:20:48.949
They should every
once in a while.

01:21:09.905 --> 01:21:11.872
How do you feel now?

01:21:11.874 --> 01:21:14.341
Better.

01:21:16.011 --> 01:21:18.879
Whoa. I...

01:21:18.881 --> 01:21:23.049
I feel better! Mom,
I gotta run to the can!

01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:28.321
Ok, I'll get the car!

01:21:30.158 --> 01:21:32.525
Jack! Bro!

01:21:32.527 --> 01:21:34.594
That was seriously gritty.

01:21:34.596 --> 01:21:37.297
You got a lot off your brawny
chest. How do you feel?

01:21:37.299 --> 01:21:40.233
Better. I just... I really
needed to say all that.

01:21:43.305 --> 01:21:46.006
Gun! I feel better!

01:21:47.943 --> 01:21:50.911
Awesome, bro.

01:21:53.315 --> 01:21:57.017
Uh, listen, I'm gonna go
for a celebratory run!

01:21:57.019 --> 01:21:58.585
Knock yourself out, kid.

01:22:28.016 --> 01:22:30.517
Just wait here, brah.

01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:37.457
Hurry! Only one minute left!

01:22:39.428 --> 01:22:41.328
Ready? Let's do this!

01:23:22.137 --> 01:23:26.072
Hey, it's me!
Look at you, varsity!

01:23:27.242 --> 01:23:31.778
Oh! I love you, I love you! I promise
I will never leave you again!

01:23:36.551 --> 01:23:39.219
Hey, what am I wearing
under here?

01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:42.188
Uh, couple layers of clothing and
a bathing suit underneath that.

01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:46.192
- Weirdo.
- Come on, let's go!

01:23:53.802 --> 01:23:58.038
- Hey, where you going, tracksuit?
- See you later, Porty!

01:23:59.508 --> 01:24:02.475
So, uh, you good
to take me back, right?

01:24:02.477 --> 01:24:05.812
Yeah, sure. But, dude,
can you loosen your grip

01:24:05.814 --> 01:24:10.517
this time? I mean, we're buds and
all, but a guy needs his space.

01:24:10.519 --> 01:24:12.719
- Got it.
- Ok.

01:24:14.056 --> 01:24:17.457
Mom!

01:24:22.464 --> 01:24:25.698
I really do feel better now.

01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:28.768
I am so glad, babe.

01:24:35.544 --> 01:24:39.679
- I'll buckle that.
- Oh, mom? I got this.

01:24:41.716 --> 01:24:44.184
From now on, you don't have
to watch me so closely.

01:24:44.186 --> 01:24:47.353
You can go out and grab
a little life for yourself.

01:24:47.355 --> 01:24:50.790
- I'm gonna be ok.
- I know you are, honey.

01:25:04.606 --> 01:25:07.340
Ah, home sweet home!

01:25:08.777 --> 01:25:12.312
Hey, you ok, man?
You had us all pretty worried.

01:25:12.314 --> 01:25:15.715
I am so ok! Just happy
to see your big ugly faces!

01:25:15.717 --> 01:25:18.218
Jack?

01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:20.386
Coach?

01:25:20.388 --> 01:25:24.224
Dad. Call me dad, son.

01:25:25.727 --> 01:25:28.128
- After what you said to me.
- Whatever I said, I...

01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:32.298
- It wasn't me.
- Just listen.

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.534
Ever since your mom passed,

01:25:34.536 --> 01:25:37.670
I thought that to be tough
with you was best,

01:25:37.672 --> 01:25:40.573
that any softness that I allowed
in would open you up...

01:25:42.344 --> 01:25:44.144
open all of us up

01:25:44.146 --> 01:25:46.913
to all that pain from the past.

01:25:46.915 --> 01:25:50.884
But... if that made you think,

01:25:50.886 --> 01:25:54.721
made any of you think,

01:25:54.723 --> 01:25:57.257
for even a moment,

01:25:57.259 --> 01:25:59.792
that I don't love you, then,

01:25:59.794 --> 01:26:03.296
I've done this all wrong.

01:26:04.566 --> 01:26:08.468
I love all you boys more
than you'll ever know.

01:26:16.778 --> 01:26:19.712
You're right. Boys can cry.

01:26:19.714 --> 01:26:22.515
C'mere, you guys.

01:26:22.517 --> 01:26:24.651
That's an order.

01:26:54.583 --> 01:26:58.418
Who, Jack? No, he's totally
like a brother to me, honest.

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:02.488
But I think I know someone
he might like like.

01:27:02.490 --> 01:27:04.657
Hey.

01:27:08.396 --> 01:27:10.496
Look, just because
the team's official,

01:27:10.498 --> 01:27:13.933
doesn't mean that she has to
come to the mall with us. Savvy?

01:27:15.637 --> 01:27:18.004
- Anyway.
- Oh, El,

01:27:18.006 --> 01:27:21.474
I'm sorry.
I've been such a jerk.

01:27:21.476 --> 01:27:24.377
We've had a great run as BFFs,

01:27:24.379 --> 01:27:27.480
but I'm cool just keeping
the memories and moving on,

01:27:27.482 --> 01:27:29.882
- if you are.
- Ok.

01:27:29.884 --> 01:27:32.986
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, MacKenzie.

01:27:34.289 --> 01:27:37.323
- 'Sup?
- Want some donuts?

01:27:37.325 --> 01:27:40.827
That one's my favorite.
I had, like, five earlier.

01:27:40.829 --> 01:27:42.695
Learning to share.

01:27:44.733 --> 01:27:48.768
- On me, bud. -Jacko!
- See you later.

01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:50.737
- Varsity boy!

01:27:50.739 --> 01:27:53.806
Aw, I'm really gonna
miss those guys.

01:27:53.808 --> 01:27:56.809
Except for the bropiles
and loogie hocking contests.

01:27:56.811 --> 01:28:00.380
Not as much as I'm gonna miss your mom's
banana bread. Oh, and that calming tea.

01:28:00.382 --> 01:28:03.449
That's serious chillaxation.

01:28:07.989 --> 01:28:10.623
Hey, dad? Do you know
Ms. O'brien here?

01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:12.992
Ellie says that she leads the
best hot yoga class in town.

01:28:12.994 --> 01:28:17.497
And mom, do you know coach Malloy? Jack
says he makes awesome wheatgrass smoothie.

01:28:17.499 --> 01:28:22.001
Well, I guess our reputations
precede us. I'm summer.

01:28:22.003 --> 01:28:25.838
I'm coa... Francis.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.975
- Francis.
- It's nice to meet you.

01:28:28.977 --> 01:28:33.479
Do you usually... I mean,
would you... as a matter

01:28:33.481 --> 01:28:35.815
of course...
I drive a truck.

01:28:43.758 --> 01:28:46.359
Delete, delete,
delete, delete, delete!

01:28:51.333 --> 01:28:53.399
My mom and me are gonna play
checkers tonight.

01:28:53.401 --> 01:28:55.101
It's gonna be a really fun
time, you should come

01:28:55.103 --> 01:28:58.037
one time if you want. I like
to invite people to things,

01:28:58.039 --> 01:29:00.406
but you don't have to.
But if you want to, you can.

01:29:00.408 --> 01:29:03.576
Get... get off my mat!

01:29:05.647 --> 01:29:07.914
Which one of you guys
isn't wearing deodorant?

01:29:07.916 --> 01:29:10.883
- Stryker.
- Dude, really.

01:29:10.885 --> 01:29:13.986
You've seen that in movies.
When a coach does that,

01:29:13.988 --> 01:29:17.090
the people, the team
supports the coach, right?

01:29:17.092 --> 01:29:20.393
I don't hang out and play video
games, I don't eat pizza.

01:29:20.395 --> 01:29:22.095
- Sorry.
- What, did you drop it?

01:29:22.097 --> 01:29:24.497
Dropped the dart.

01:29:27.001 --> 01:29:29.035
Hey, El.
