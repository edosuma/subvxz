met with people numerous times
and nothing's been done is

29:21.166 --> 29:24.166
just so sad.

29:27.533 --> 29:33.100
So, realistically, is there
anything, or is that cycle just

29:33.100 --> 29:35.233
gonna always be there?
Like, what would it take?

29:35.233 --> 29:38.033
>> JAMMAL: It's about, we have
to start choosing people who

29:38.033 --> 29:40.400
represent us and elect them into
office.

some morals?

29:42.367 --> 29:44.400

29:44.400 --> 29:47.100
place in the world with this
raging epidemic.

29:47.100 --> 29:49.633
Clearly, it's preventable.
People in between the ages of 18

29:49.633 --> 29:53.133
and 29, if they all got out
there and voted, they would make

29:53.133 --> 29:55.533
the decision that election.
>> CAMERON: What we're trying to

29:55.533 --> 29:58.533
do is to make voting more
ingrained in pop culture, more

29:58.533 --> 30:01.133
ingrained in its being cool.
>> KIM: I still don't know

30:01.133 --> 30:04.066
(bleep) about voting.
I literally only know the

30:04.066 --> 30:06.333
president election every four
years, and that's it.

30:06.333 --> 30:08.400
>> JAMMAL: Yeah.
>> KIM: So when people say,

30:08.400 --> 30:11.166
like, "Get out and vote," like,
what is there to vote on?

30:11.166 --> 30:13.200
>> CAMERON: Every two years, we
have the opportunity to

30:13.200 --> 30:16.166
completely reshape the House of
Representatives and a lot of

30:16.166 --> 30:19.600
the Senate, and so, this
November 6, there is going to

30:19.600 --> 30:23.667
be an election in America that
can solve gun violence.

30:23.667 --> 30:26.200

wants to have more kids, and I

30:26.200 --> 30:28.567
was like, "I just can't."
Like, there's... our world

30:28.567 --> 30:31.333
is so (bleep) up, and then we
were there, I was like, wait a

30:31.333 --> 30:35.600
minute, I feel like the whole
next generation is so together

30:35.600 --> 30:38.300
and is gonna change the world,
and, like, we can have another

30:38.300 --> 30:40.100
one.
We'll figure it out.

30:40.100 --> 30:42.500

30:42.500 --> 30:46.600

it was so...

30:46.600 --> 30:52.233
just powerful.
Like, it literally gave me hope.

30:52.233 --> 30:57.633
Seeing these kids taking up
their time to talk about issues

30:57.633 --> 31:01.300
that are so important, I think,
is just so selfless and so great

31:01.300 --> 31:04.433
of them.
I honestly feel like there's so

31:04.433 --> 31:07.100
many adults out there that can
learn a thing or two from these

31:07.100 --> 31:09.200
kids.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.200

No, I'm voting this...

31:14.734 --> 31:17.500
