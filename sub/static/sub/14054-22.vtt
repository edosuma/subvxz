<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

00:03.600 --> 00:05.830
- <i>Previously on</i> The Valley <i>:</i>
- <i>Stay in Tarzana.</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:07.598
<i>Previously on</i> The Valley <i>:</i>

00:07.760 --> 00:09.716
<i>I don 't feel like I fit here in Tarzana.</i>

00:09.880 --> 00:11.791
You owe it to yourself.
Get out. Get free.

00:11.960 --> 00:15.316
- Why do I need to leave? You're here.
- Exactly.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.789
- Luke.
- Luke came by to defrag my hard drive.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.552
- You look so hot.
- Now, forgive me...

00:19.720 --> 00:22.792
...this can't possibly be happening, right?
I'm crazy.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.315
I have this whole life to figure out.
And so does Ryan.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.471
Take care of him.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.312
I'll see you.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.677
So then did you take your watch off
during the deed, or what exactly?

00:38.840 --> 00:41.115
Wanna wait in the car?
I can pick this up myself.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.077
No, I got more questions.
I don't understand...

00:43.240 --> 00:44.992
...did you take it
off before foreplay?

00:45.160 --> 00:47.435
- That would seem presumptuous...
- No, seriously...

00:47.600 --> 00:50.956
I like to leave the watch on. I like
to leave it on to know how I'm doing...

00:51.120 --> 00:52.519
...if I'm beating my old time.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.148
It's sort of a sex marathon,
not a sex sprint.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.753
Excuse me. Hi.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.480
I called earlier about the watch
that was left here.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.551
Room 204, right?

01:01.720 --> 01:04.075
Yeah. Such a nice girl
was staying in there.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.993
Beautiful too. Your girlfriend?

01:08.880 --> 01:11.713
- Okay. That's a little awkward.
- No, she's not. But thank you.

01:11.880 --> 01:12.949
A girl like that?

01:13.120 --> 01:15.953
- You'd be a lucky guy if you could...
- Thank you for your time.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.031
Or his time. The timepiece.
Thanks a lot.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.315
One day, we'll look back on that
and we'll laugh.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.675
We'll laugh, laugh some more,
have a good laugh.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.274
Not at my timepiece joke,
but at the situation.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.158
I'm fine.
Theresa's back with Eddie...

01:30.320 --> 01:32.550
...where she should be. Right?
- Yes. Absolutely.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.632
This is a good time for Ryan Atwood.
This is "Clean-Slate Ryan."

01:35.800 --> 01:39.395
Finally, you have no women to protect
from violent, goateed factory workers...

01:39.560 --> 01:41.676
...or pill-popping manic-depressives.
- You're right.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.876
- I really do have a clean slate.
- You do.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.031
Dude, since day one
of you getting here...

01:46.200 --> 01:48.316
...it's been nothing but lady drama
with you.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.313
Marissa, Theresa, Luke, Oliver, Eddie.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.438
- I'm exhausted just thinking about it.
- I am kind of tired.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.990
Should be. But you know what?
You're gonna get a break. You deserve it.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.071
Think I'm gonna declare this month...

02:00.240 --> 02:02.754
...Angst-Free Ryan Month.
- Think it'll last all month?

02:02.920 --> 02:06.959
Angst-Free Ryan Week. With an option
for an additional week, if you like it.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.079
- Okay. Thanks, bud.
- Right on.

02:09.759 --> 02:12.194
Hey. What's Luke doing here?

02:12.360 --> 02:14.510
- Tell him about your watch?
- No. Why would I?

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.920 --> 02:38.319
It didn't even last the night.

03:26.880 --> 03:30.031
I can't believe they were at a motel.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.397
It's just... It's so cheap.
It's so tawdry.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.757
Yeah. That's the real moral
of the story here.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.798
You know we're gonna have to see
Luke at school today, right?

03:42.920 --> 03:44.592
How could he do it?

03:45.440 --> 03:48.079
I mean, I get how he could do it,
it's Mrs. Cooper, but...

03:48.240 --> 03:51.152
What about her?
It's her daughter's ex-boyfriend.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.675
- Lf Marissa found out...
- No. She cannot find out.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.229
- She doesn't handle bad news well.
- It's gotta end...

03:56.400 --> 03:58.834
...before she finds out.
- I agree.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.876
Maybe you should take the reins
on this one.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.873
I would, but I feel like
it's more your speed.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.111
Sandy, Jimmy's here.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.474
Hot, hot, hot. Hey.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.710
- How are you, Jimmy?
- We're screwed.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.678
Oh, good. Nothing like a little
optimism in the morning.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.910
I'm serious.
Opening day is around the corner.

04:18.079 --> 04:19.832
We've got no contractor, no designer.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.912
- When did you last look at the books?
- I don't. That's your job.

04:23.120 --> 04:27.716
Well, we've basically blown through
our entire budget.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.914
You're really not so good at
managing the money, are you?

04:32.080 --> 04:33.877
No. I'm really not.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.435
- How did that happen?
- Construction, labor, permits.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.999
Oh, wow.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.195
A letter from Hailey.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.238
She's an aerobics instructor at Club Med
in Turks and Caicos.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.152
Turks and Caicos? Wow.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.675
- Unbelievable.
- That is unbelievable.

04:55.840 --> 04:56.989
Hailey got a job.

04:57.160 --> 05:00.072
So I'm gonna spend the weekend
interviewing designers.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.872
Not that we can afford any of them.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.837
Julie's gonna take Marissa
so I can work.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.675
I better get to work so I can make
some more money that you and I can lose.

05:07.840 --> 05:11.071
So you want a designer on the cheap?
How cheap? Like, free?

05:11.240 --> 05:12.992
Free is cheap.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.519
Julie.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.636
No. No way.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.033
- She's good.
- Yeah. At manipulating others.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.753
And backstabbing, pot-stirring...

05:23.920 --> 05:26.229
...generally creating an atmosphere
of hate and distrust.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.311
Did a nice job on the
Newport Group offices.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.278
They were elegant and tasteful.
It was shocking, really.

05:31.440 --> 05:35.194
This restaurant is supposed to be
my oasis, my happy place.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.830
A place to rebuild after Julie.
Not a...

05:39.000 --> 05:42.515
She's not doing to The Lighthouse
what she did to my marriage.

05:42.880 --> 05:47.032
Free is cheap, Jimmy.
I mean, what choice do we have?

05:47.680 --> 05:50.990
You asked me, Coop, and I think it's best.
You need some time off.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.435
Ever since I've known you,
you've had a boyfriend.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.669
You're right.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.877
You need to be independent.
How else are you gonna find a new guy?

05:58.040 --> 06:00.554
You can't be with someone
until you can be by yourself.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.551
- I can be by myself.
- And by "yourself"...

06:02.720 --> 06:05.518
...I mean still hanging out with me.
- Okay, good. Thank God.

06:05.680 --> 06:06.874
What's going on over here?

06:07.640 --> 06:09.551
- Can I have a hug?
- Grady had a late night.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.073
I don't know.
I guess they're filming something.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.233
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Coop!
- What? What?

06:17.400 --> 06:18.549
Grady Bridges.

06:18.720 --> 06:21.598
- Who's Grady Bridges?
- Jake Needleman, <i>The Valley</i>.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.475
- He is so cute.
- Really? You think?

06:25.640 --> 06:28.200
Yeah. Not in your traditional way,
but he's hilarious.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.114
He's so funny. I hear he,
like, improvises all of his scenes.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.753
Let's go say hi. Be cool, okay?

06:38.600 --> 06:42.229
Hey, Grady, we're your biggest fans.
<i>The Valley</i> is my favorite show.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.075
- Thank you. Cool. I'm glad you like it.
- I love it. Obsessed. Addicted.

06:46.240 --> 06:51.360
- So, what are you guys doing here?
- We are on what they call "location"...

06:51.520 --> 06:53.192
...which means we're
shooting a scene...

06:53.360 --> 06:56.238
My character starts dating
this girl from Newport.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.470
- No, you'll ruin it!
- Okay. Okay.

06:58.640 --> 07:02.599
- Are you as obsessed as she is?
- Actually, I've never seen your show...

07:02.840 --> 07:03.829
- Coop!
- What?

07:05.720 --> 07:08.314
- See, now that's funny.
- Oh, that was funny.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.710
That was funny. Funny girl.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.313
Maybe they're not having sex.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.755
Maybe they just
spoon and watch <i>Charlie Rose.</i>

07:15.920 --> 07:17.876
You're right. That's probably it.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.429
Oh, my God, you guys.
We have the craziest news ever.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.433
I mean, nothing you could tell us
could top this.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.551
We met Grady Bridges.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.875
Star of <i>The Valley</i>, the best show ever.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.232
Okay. Anyway, he invited us
to his birthday party tomorrow night.

07:34.400 --> 07:38.598
The star of a hit TV show invited you
to his cool Hollywood birthday party?

07:38.760 --> 07:41.149
- That is awesome.
- There's no need for jealousy.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.833
- I'd never date an actor.
- Really?

07:43.000 --> 07:43.989
Yes.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.313
- I got us a couple of plus-ones.
- Great.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.914
I have to show everybody
the pictures of me and Grady.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.559
Thank God I had my camera phone.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.631
They're the autograph of
the 21 st century.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.553
Summer, I'd like to see these photos.
Why don't we share.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.195
- So how's Theresa?
- She's good. She's back with Eddie.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.397
- Have you talked to her since she left?
- Yeah, we have...

08:04.560 --> 08:07.472
...but we're taking some time apart.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.676
- Best thing, I guess.
- Yeah.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.160
- Oh, we should go.
- Yeah.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.871
Good light. Exposed brick, it's a bit '80s,
but these trends are cyclical.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.952
South-facing windows.
These floors could be sanded.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.997
And the beams are rather oppressive.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.074
Some white enamel could
lighten it right up.

08:32.200 --> 08:35.192
- I'll do it.
- Now, you know we can't pay you.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.191
Well, everybody has to start somewhere.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.238
And the value it'll add to my portfolio
alone will be worth it.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.231
It'll be my calling card.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.231
And we should get started right away.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.312
You will have to pay for the floors,
the linens, the silverware.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.472
Unless you want patrons eating
with their hands, like Jimmy does.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.393
Happy place. Happy place. Happy place.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.118
How much, Julie?

08:55.720 --> 08:57.915
What do you think, Kirsten?
Low six?

08:58.080 --> 09:00.958
What? We don't have that money.
Are you skimming off the top?

09:01.120 --> 09:03.156
No, sweetie. That was you.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.711
My oasis is being violated.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.950
My happy place is
very unhappy right now.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.758
Now calm down, Jimbo. Just breathe.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.751
- I could pitch in.
- No. No.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.036
Please. I appreciate it, I do. But don't.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.714
I mean, separation of church and state.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.199
This is my thing.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.716
So, what are you saying?
That this is your happy place?

09:23.640 --> 09:24.914
- No.
- Caleb could help.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.752
No. This is my happy place.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.956
It's my oasis from
the rich and insufferable.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.873
It'd be a good investment for him.
And the best thing for you two.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.110
No. It would be the worst.
It would... No.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.238
- Kirsten, please back me up.
- He could be a silent partner.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.551
A silent assassin.
He would ruin everything.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.199
He'd want goulash on the menu.

09:42.360 --> 09:45.432
I don't think we have a choice.
We can't raise that kind of cash.

09:52.320 --> 09:55.232
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Nothing.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.834
So did you have sex
with Julie Cooper today?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.833
- What...? What...?
- I saw you at the motel.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.958
What are you thinking, man?
Marissa's mom?

10:04.120 --> 10:06.350
I know. I know what that
must have looked like...

10:06.520 --> 10:09.159
...or seemed like,
but it's not like that.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.598
- We've got a connection.
- Yeah, not anymore, you don't.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.031
- Lf Marissa finds out...
- She won't.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.760
Just like she didn't find out
about you in Tijuana?

10:20.920 --> 10:24.833
It's a small town. People find out,
then they talk. It's only a matter of time.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.711
I've never felt this way about a girl,
a woman, before.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.474
Yeah, I don't care.
Tomorrow, Marissa's going to L.A.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.598
You, you're going to Julie's.
It's gonna end.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.398
Got it? It's gonna end.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.512
Hey, man. What are you doing?

10:51.680 --> 10:53.591
Watching <i>The Valley</i>.
I picked it up on DVD.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.955
- Yeah? I talked to Luke.
- Would you just give me...

10:56.120 --> 10:57.997
...till the end of
the episode, please?

10:58.960 --> 11:00.473
- Is that Grady?
- Yeah.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.069
- He's kind of like you.
- What, handsome and charming?

11:03.240 --> 11:05.470
Geeky and sarcastic.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.637
Oh, God. He is like me.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.711
He is like me,
except with his own TV show.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.075
- I was kidding. He's just a character...
- No, no.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.754
He improvises all his lines.
That's totally him.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.114
And he's totally me.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.669
Except on a prime-time soap.
And, Ryan...

11:20.840 --> 11:23.035
...if you could have the real me
or the TV me...

11:23.200 --> 11:25.270
...which would you take?
You'd take the TV me.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.637
We're not going to L.A. I'm gonna
lose Summer to the real-life TV me.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.314
No. We're going to L.A.
We're taking the girls.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.596
Luke's breaking up with Julie
while we're gone.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.988
- You took care of it?
- Yeah.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.914
That's good. I told you you'd be back to
"Angst-Free Ryan" in no time.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.472
I'll get it.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.473
Hey.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.757
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.037
- So I'm not going to L.A.
- What? Why?

11:57.360 --> 12:00.716
You know how you said
sometimes time apart is the best thing?

12:02.920 --> 12:05.639
Well, I think time apart might be
the best thing...

12:06.440 --> 12:08.192
...for us.
- You do?

12:08.360 --> 12:13.388
Since you showed up,
it's been pretty intense.

12:14.120 --> 12:17.669
Good and bad, but intense.

12:19.160 --> 12:22.516
And I don't know, maybe we just need
to be away from each other.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.192
Independent...

12:26.560 --> 12:27.959
...for a little while.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.712
You wanna start this
independent thing today?

12:33.400 --> 12:34.753
We both have clean slates.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.391
This is a good time for us
to be by ourselves.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.191
So you go to L.A., and I'm gonna
spend some time with my mom.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.910
See you.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.354
So that was it?
That's your big plan you had to sleep on?

12:59.520 --> 13:02.114
- Lf I don't go, Marissa will.
- Fine. Except you're going.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.350
- Will your parents let us go?
- I'll handle it.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.511
- You're gonna lie?
- No, that was the old me.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.272
I've evolved. I'm a man of honor.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.829
So I need you to talk to them.
It's your specialty.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.672
Seems like a lot of things
are my specialty.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.229
Yeah, well, great leadership's
all about delegation.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.630
- So now I'm your employee?
- No. We're partners.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.679
- What do you do?
- I'm working on the business plan, okay?

13:20.840 --> 13:22.273
And that's gonna be awesome.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.352
I just need you to convince my parents,
convince Marissa...

13:25.520 --> 13:28.876
...and I'm gonna supervise.
God, it's so easy.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.076
I should go into business for myself.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.237
We crane up through the bushes.
That's perfect.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.552
I'm sorry, Ryan, is it just me, or do my
parents get better-Iooking every day?

13:39.760 --> 13:42.149
- Here we go.
- What?

13:42.960 --> 13:46.032
- What do you want, Seth?
- Can't a child just admire the beauty...

13:46.200 --> 13:49.988
...of his parents in the morning light?
You don't look a day over perfection.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.878
- Also, there's a party in Hollywood.
- No.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.632
- Why?
- I don't have to tell you why.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.234
- I'm just telling you no.
- See what you're doing here?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.277
- I do.
- I'm trying to tell you the truth...

13:58.440 --> 14:00.510
...and establish trust here.
I could've lied.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.592
I could've easily said I was going
to Comicon or an IMAX movie.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.116
- All these devices at my fingertips.
- I knew you never went to that movie.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.435
- Tag. You're tagged in.
- Yeah. Okay.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.716
It's a birthday party.
We'll be home by midnight.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.438
No drinking, drugs or fighting.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.637
- See?
- Now that we've covered the obvious...

14:17.800 --> 14:19.199
- Whose birthday?
- Grady Bridges.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.632
- Oh, the guy from <i>The Valley</i> ?
- Yes.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.678
- I love him. He's so cute.
- Yeah, and, you guys...

14:24.840 --> 14:26.956
...he can get any girl
in the world he wants.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.317
Right now he wants Summer.
Okay? I have to go.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.318
Please. I have to go.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.548
You call when you get there,
and you're home by 11:30.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.757
Don't spend an extra minute in L.A.
The town will steal your soul.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.480
It's about to steal my girlfriend.
I'm the only thing...

14:46.640 --> 14:48.676
...standing between Summer and
a development deal. Thank you.

14:48.840 --> 14:52.276
Can you get me an autograph?
Your cell phone takes pictures, right?

14:52.480 --> 14:55.358
- Now you have to convince Marissa.
- Gonna make me do that too?

14:55.920 --> 14:58.354
We're business partners.
We serve different functions.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.279
I'm the brains, you're the brawn.
I'm in the ivory tower...

15:01.440 --> 15:04.159
...you're down there on the streets,
making it happen.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.399
- Hey.
- Call you back.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.949
So when I said we needed to spend
some time apart...

15:15.120 --> 15:17.270
...I meant more than a couple hours.
- I know.

15:17.440 --> 15:21.479
- What's that?
- Luke's puka shells. I just found them.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.188
Blast from the past, huh?

15:24.400 --> 15:26.550
Okay. Here's the thing.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.632
Not going to L.A. Because I'm not going,
that's not independent.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.872
To be really independent,
we both need to go to L.A. Independently.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.429
- But together at the same time.
- You sound like Seth.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.592
I know, it rubs off. Look, I gotta go.

15:38.760 --> 15:41.797
- Seth, unsupervised in a big city...
- Okay. No, I get that.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.474
Okay. And I don't want you
to miss out because of me.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.830
And, you know, we haven't had fun
in a long time.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.549
- This is gonna be fun.
- Usually you don't think anything's fun.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.678
- It's always me talking you into going.
- People change.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.149
And we're gonna be living
in the same town, right?

15:57.320 --> 16:00.471
You know, going to the same school.
And we're friends, yes?

16:00.640 --> 16:05.475
So, you know, we're gonna have to
do things independently.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.870
- But together.
- You're right.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.513
So you really want me to go?

16:13.800 --> 16:16.473
It's not about what I want.
It's about what you need.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.919
Okay.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.598
Maybe, a little.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.597
- All right. Let me just go get ready.
- All right. Cool.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.997
- So you need me, Sanford?
- Here we go.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.197
- Dad.
- Look, you did me a favor.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.755
- It's my turn to do one for you.
- Don't do me any favors.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.070
Let's hear him out. Okay?

16:50.240 --> 16:53.994
- Your chef. What's he done?
- Nothing, really. TV dinners mostly.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.639
He's terrible.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.710
- Look, I know when I'm not wanted.
- And yet you're always at our house.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.758
Marco was a sous chef at Aubergine.
He's fantastic.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.513
- Aubergine, that's a good spot.
- He could prepare...

17:05.680 --> 17:08.035
...some meals for you tonight.
- Good thinking.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.556
I can't, I'm busy. I'm having dinner
with the board of the philharmonic.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.632
Doesn't that include the editor in chief
of <i>Riviera Magazine</i>...

17:14.800 --> 17:17.872
...the owner of the <i>Daily Pilot</i>,
owner of the Mighty Ducks?

17:18.040 --> 17:20.998
Yeah, well, some of them used to be
Jimmy's clients, before...

17:21.160 --> 17:22.957
- Point being there, Julie?
- They're the tastemakers...

17:23.119 --> 17:26.430
...of Newport Beach. Why don't you
have Marco cook for them.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.396
You can't buy free publicity like that.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.279
If you have a restaurant,
you gotta cook for a lot of people.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.795
"If you have a restaurant,
you gotta cook for a lot of people."

17:33.960 --> 17:36.758
- That's our mission statement.
- We need the money, the press.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.751
- I know.
- Good idea, Jules.

17:38.960 --> 17:42.157
We just gutted the place.
There's dust all over. There's no furniture.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.995
We can do it at our house.
The kids are on their way to L.A.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.354
It's perfect.

17:53.960 --> 17:57.953
Oh, my God. We haven't moved in...
It's been forever now.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.236
How do people live like this?
How do you do it?

18:00.400 --> 18:03.631
I don't know. Times like these I wish
we had a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.597
I always wish we had one.
It's a flying car.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.478
You know, my mom's
never home anymore.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.631
She's always sending Kaitlin
to my grandma's.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.234
Know what it sounds like to me,
as a child of divorce?

18:12.400 --> 18:15.551
- Think she's having an affair?
- When my mom started blowing me off...

18:15.720 --> 18:18.393
Oh, it's a flying car!

18:18.600 --> 18:20.238
No, my bad. Actually, that's a plane.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.358
- She's probably just working a lot.
- She's a professional woman.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.112
- Yeah, busy.
- Getting busy.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.158
- Who you think's gonna be there tonight?
- I hope Orlando Bloom.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.914
- Legolas is so hot.
- Right on. I'm hoping for a little...

18:31.080 --> 18:34.311
...Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley,
maybe Kate Bosworth myself...

18:35.040 --> 18:37.190
What? It's okay for you
to pine over Legolas?

18:37.360 --> 18:39.237
Yeah, he's an Elf.
He saved Middle-earth.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.231
That is a huge part of European history.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.635
Don't worry about it.
Tonight's gonna be fun.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.958
Luke better get it done.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.798
Well, see you soonishly.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.832
What about that date, Juju?

18:56.400 --> 18:59.437
Let's just see how tonight goes, Caleb.
I want you focused.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.069
Bye.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.589
- Hey. We need to talk.
- Luke.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.759
- What if Caleb saw you?
- Yeah, what are you doing with him?

19:14.920 --> 19:17.912
Shouldn't he be washing his dentures?
Are you guys back together?

19:18.080 --> 19:19.752
- Don't start.
- You were just using me...

19:19.920 --> 19:21.956
...until Grandpa came back?

19:27.240 --> 19:30.391
Okay. But I don't have a lot of time.

19:30.560 --> 19:33.438
- Okay, but we'll talk after?
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.349
- Who let that heavy-set girl in?
- That was a guy.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.635
Hey, girls, what's up?

19:58.800 --> 20:00.074
- I'm glad you made it.
- Hey.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.992
I wanna introduce you to some people.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.993
- Wait.
- How does that guy play high-school?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.309
Hollywood, man.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.477
I thought it was a clich Á, young
Hollywood doing coke with strippers.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.198
I didn't even think they
ate bread anymore.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.918
Can I borrow your phone?

20:27.880 --> 20:32.192
Boys, I want you to meet some people.
This is Summer, Marissa and some guy.

20:33.640 --> 20:37.155
- Are they on the show?
- No. This is Team Grady, right?

20:37.320 --> 20:42.030
This is my agent, this is my manager,
this is my lawyer, this is my publicist.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.634
And then this is my producing partner.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.509
- You have a producing partner?
- We control several properties, man.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.513
- Just got the rights to <i>The Golden Girls</i>.
- Oh, my God. No way!

20:51.680 --> 20:55.355
Yeah. We're gonna make it into a movie,
but we're gonna make the Golden Girls...

20:55.520 --> 20:57.909
...you know, young and hot.
- Oh.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.959
Luke, it's me. I wanted to make sure
you took care of it.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.836
Take care of it.

21:07.560 --> 21:08.834
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.679
- So do you want to meet the cast?
- Not really. You?

21:11.840 --> 21:13.592
Yeah. Not really.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.190
- Excuse me.
- Well...

21:21.160 --> 21:23.549
- Oh, my God. What is with you?
- What?

21:23.760 --> 21:27.070
- Relax. All you L.A. Chicks are so lame.
- We're not from L.A.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.389
We're from Orange County.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.437
Orange County?

21:31.600 --> 21:33.955
- She said, "Ew."
- Glad we're not the ones fighting.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.076
Yeah, glad we're not
one of those couples.

21:37.640 --> 21:38.914
Or any kind of couple.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.469
- Right. It's definitely better.
- Yep.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.193
Hey there. Having fun yet?

21:46.920 --> 21:48.512
- Hailey?
- Ryan?

21:52.400 --> 21:54.231
- What are you...?
- What are you...?

21:54.400 --> 21:57.790
Hailey, keep it moving.
Couples pay extra.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.313
Gotta go.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.472
- Is that...?
- Kirsten's sister, Hailey.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.790
- Does Kirsten know she's here?
- I doubt it.

22:04.960 --> 22:08.032
This is Kirsten's worst nightmare.
All she does is worry about her.

22:10.280 --> 22:12.874
I'm late. I thought
we were only gonna do it once.

22:13.040 --> 22:16.396
- Can we talk now? Because I really...
- Can't, gotta go be with the adults.

22:16.560 --> 22:17.993
I'll talk to you later.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.071
Newport used to be a glamorous town.

22:24.240 --> 22:27.755
An escape for Hollywood stars
like John Wayne, Robert Mitchum.

22:27.920 --> 22:31.879
The Lighthouse could be our chance
to bring those people back.

22:32.040 --> 22:35.237
Wait, Cal. I don't think even
The Lighthouse can bring back the Duke.

22:36.800 --> 22:39.598
What I mean is, we think
The Lighthouse is step one...

22:39.760 --> 22:42.479
...in the renaissance of Newport
for destination dining...

22:42.640 --> 22:44.995
...a magnet for glitz and glamour...

22:45.160 --> 22:47.196
...and, well, cash.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.873
Look, Jimmy and I view
The Lighthouse as a chance...

22:53.040 --> 22:55.634
...to restore the restaurant
to its former glory.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.360
It's just something from Newport,
for Newport.

22:58.520 --> 23:02.149
We think it can be a bit of both.
An icon of the past.

23:02.320 --> 23:06.438
- A beacon for the future.
- A bridge from the past to the present.

23:06.600 --> 23:10.070
From Newport to the rest of the world.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.952
- Hello, everybody.
- Hey, Julie.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.393
So sorry I'm late.
I hope I didn't miss anything.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.869
- Hey.
- You are glowing.

23:21.040 --> 23:24.396
Well, I'm just so excited.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.199
<i>You have one new message.</i>

23:37.360 --> 23:41.069
<i>Luke, it's me. I'm just calling</i>
<i>to make sure you took care of it.</i>

23:41.240 --> 23:42.798
<i>Take care of it.</i>

23:58.160 --> 23:59.832
Hey.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.035
Are you happy, Coop?

24:01.200 --> 24:04.556
These the kind of people we want?
Because we're gonna be stuck with them.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.915
I know, Sandy.
It's not what we wanted exactly.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.837
It's exactly not what we wanted at all.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.878
Look, we need the money.
Without Caleb, we've got nothing.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.268
Maybe nothing is better.

24:14.440 --> 24:18.035
That's an easy position to take if you
have another job. This is all I have.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.475
- Hello?
- Sandy, hey, it's me.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.871
- Ryan? Is everything okay?
- Not really.

24:24.040 --> 24:26.838
- We found Hailey.
- What do you mean, you found Hailey?

24:27.040 --> 24:29.190
- Hailey?
- Well, she got a job...

24:29.360 --> 24:30.918
...as a stripper.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.918
- There are strippers at this party?
- Strippers?

24:35.080 --> 24:36.672
I never should've agreed to this.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.513
- What do you want us to do?
- <i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

24:39.680 --> 24:43.355
- Hailey is not your responsibility.
- Where are they? Is she okay?

24:43.520 --> 24:46.717
- What club are you at?
- It's Luna Chicks.

24:46.880 --> 24:50.714
Luna Chicks? Well, that's just great.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.233
- What are you gonna do?
- I will deal with Hailey tomorrow.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.994
Meanwhile, I want you guys home.
Pronto.

24:57.160 --> 24:58.718
All right.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.111
- What's going on?
- They found Hailey.

25:02.280 --> 25:05.078
- Working as a stripper at this party.
- Is she okay?

25:05.240 --> 25:06.878
No, of course not, no.
She's Hailey.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.268
Should we do something?

25:08.760 --> 25:11.558
You know what? We should not let
Hailey ruin another evening.

25:11.720 --> 25:15.235
We got enough to contend with,
and if Kirsten finds out about this...

25:15.400 --> 25:17.470
- I don't know...
- We'll deal with it tomorrow.

25:17.640 --> 25:21.155
- Everything is going so well.
- Everyone seems really excited.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.880
What the hell is that smell?

25:24.720 --> 25:27.837
- What are we cooking here?
- Meat loaf. It's my mother's specialty.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.594
I have the most important people
in the county in there...

25:30.760 --> 25:32.352
...the most sophisticated palates
in Newport...

25:32.520 --> 25:34.590
...and you offer them Nana Cohen's
meat loaf?

25:34.760 --> 25:36.955
- Dad. It's their menu.
- The menu of lunatics.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.192
This is a disaster. I'll have to
call Catherine Zeta-Jones' people.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.237
I was trying to get her for the opening.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.233
How quickly can you get to the
Crab Shack and pick up some fresh tuna?

25:45.400 --> 25:47.709
Whoa. No, Marco. This is our restaurant.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.395
You don't have a restaurant without me
and you don't have me with meat loaf.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.152
Well, then, maybe we're better off.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.709
A man's life comes down to
a few decisive moments...

25:55.880 --> 25:59.509
...and maybe this meat loaf
is one of them.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.280
This restaurant was supposed to be fun.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.557
If you wanna go and ruin everything
that this restaurant is about...

26:05.760 --> 26:08.718
...then go ahead. Fine.
I don't want any part of it.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.953
Good night. Good luck.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.469
That's why the man is bankrupt.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.710
Do what you like. Sink the ship.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.472
But make it quick. I'm starving.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.788
Hey, Marco, there's a lot
riding on this meat loaf.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.595
- Julie, is that a...?
- Curling-iron burn.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.318
Yeah.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.198
I'm gonna go check on Cal.

26:37.640 --> 26:40.518
- This place is too crowded.
- Soon as we find Seth and Summer...

26:40.680 --> 26:42.636
...we're out of here.
- And Hailey.

26:42.800 --> 26:46.873
- I don't know. It's none of my business.
- Yeah, it is. It's your family.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.473
We need to find her and get out of here.

26:51.920 --> 26:55.037
All right, you wait here.
If you see Seth, don't let him move.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.873
- And I'll just go try to find her.
- Not without me.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.634
Come on.

27:01.640 --> 27:05.633
Cheers, cheers.
To me, in all my glory...

27:05.800 --> 27:07.552
...and a second season.

27:12.840 --> 27:17.709
- Hey.
- Hi. Hi. How's it going?

27:17.880 --> 27:19.871
- I'm so exhausted.
- Yeah?

27:20.040 --> 27:22.235
I've been up all night working
on my thesis.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.470
"Magical Realism in
American Literature."

27:24.640 --> 27:26.551
Familiar with the works of
Thomas Pynchon?

27:27.160 --> 27:32.792
- I've only read <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>.
- <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> is his masterpiece.

27:35.560 --> 27:38.438
- Don't tell anyone I'm in grad school.
- Okay.

27:38.640 --> 27:42.269
So I've got a new episode that
hasn't aired yet. You wanna see it?

27:42.440 --> 27:45.716
- No way. You have a new episode?
- Yeah, on tape. Yeah?

27:45.880 --> 27:48.189
Yeah. Hold on, I just have to...

27:48.360 --> 27:52.353
Oh, yeah, no.
I'm not armed or anything.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.196
- Yeah, that's a...
- Camera phone.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.157
It's the autograph of the 21 st century.

28:01.320 --> 28:03.436
Yeah. That's what they say.
That's what they say.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.428
Let's go.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.238
Call me sometime.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.239
I will.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.634
There you are.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.793
- I thought you'd flown the coop as well.
- Just trying to get a little peace and quiet.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.349
Wax philosophical about why
your partner up and quit.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.954
He hasn't quit.
He went after Hailey.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.350
What are you talking about?
Hailey's in Club Med.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.717
Oh, she's in a club, but in Hollywood,
working as a stripper.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.480
Ryan just called. They found her.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.992
Anyway, that's where my partner went.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.232
And that's why he's my partner.

28:56.240 --> 29:00.950
This is so cool. You're here, and here.
It's awesome.

29:01.120 --> 29:04.669
- <i>I'm out of here. "La-tro."</i>
- Oh, my God. I bet that was improvised.

29:06.600 --> 29:10.070
- Listen, I'm really glad that you came...
- No, wait. I wanna watch.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.955
Why? I'm not in this scene.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.315
It's just so good.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.913
I wish I was from the Valley.

29:24.840 --> 29:28.071
- Hey, where's Summer?
- I don't know, off with Grady somewhere.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.879
I talk about Pynchon for two seconds,
suddenly she's gone.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.712
- I got something else for you.
- Dude.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.468
You have a clean slate now,
so if I was you...

29:36.640 --> 29:39.154
...I'd procure a little
private dance time with...

29:47.760 --> 29:50.069
- Oh, my God. That's Hailey.
- Yeah. That's what l...

29:52.640 --> 29:54.631
Hey, hey, what the hell are you doing?

29:54.800 --> 29:58.110
I thought you were an aerobics instructor
in the Caribbean or something.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.191
I figured the truth wouldn't
go over so well.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.998
My mom will freak
when she finds out.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.639
Don't tell her.
Not that she'd care.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.119
She would if she knew
what you're doing.

30:05.280 --> 30:07.874
What's wrong with it?
I make good money, I'm on my own.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.792
You look terrible.
You work here?

30:09.960 --> 30:12.394
Let me just grab my girlfriend,
and we'll go figure it out.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.676
What, tired today?
Didn't do enough coke?

30:14.840 --> 30:16.068
Hey, take it easy, man.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.595
- Get back to work.
- Don't tell her what to do.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.309
- Excuse me? You got a problem?
- Yeah, yeah.

30:21.480 --> 30:22.993
- I do.
- No, he doesn't. I'm sorry.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.435
We're gonna grab my girlfriend
and grab my aunt...

30:25.600 --> 30:28.433
...more gently than you, and we'll leave.
- You're leaving now.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.672
Get them out of my club.
Out, out, out.

30:33.160 --> 30:37.278
Bye. Nice meeting you.
I don't wanna see them in my club again.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.997
- Are we gonna just leave Hailey here?
- I don't think we have a choice.

30:51.160 --> 30:54.391
- We can't leave without her.
- I can't get ahold of Summer.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.676
I think we should split up.
Let's scale a wall.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.274
Find a fire escape.
Climb through a window. The usual.

31:00.720 --> 31:03.996
I was all-camp "Capture the Flag,"
Camp Tuckahoe. I'm very stealth.

31:08.680 --> 31:11.274
That's kind of dewy.
I'm gonna go around.

31:16.160 --> 31:19.391
- We're going to the VIP entrance.
- We're not VIP.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.312
This is Hollywood.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.516
Meet me in a minute. I have an idea.

31:24.080 --> 31:25.638
This meat loaf is fantastic.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.155
This is what we had planned.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.078
Back to basics. Comfort food.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.589
What's old is new again.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.671
I couldn't have said that better myself.

31:33.840 --> 31:36.673
- Even though I already did.
- So glad that you like it.

31:36.840 --> 31:39.149
- I'm going to get more wine. Anyone?
- Oh, terrific.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.158
Juju.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.469
Bring the wine, dear.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.356
This one's empty.
I'm gonna get another.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.518
What the hell are you doing here?

32:32.680 --> 32:34.557
- We need to talk.
- Wait outside my house.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.314
Go hide in the bushes or something.
Go! Go!

32:41.760 --> 32:42.954
Back to work.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.793
I told you, VIPs only.

32:48.480 --> 32:51.358
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

32:52.680 --> 32:56.389
I love you so much!
You are my favorite character.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.034
- Do you watch <i>The Valley</i> ?
- No, I have a job.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.838
It's only, like, the best show ever.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.356
You are actually a little shorter
than I imagined, but still, so hot.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.998
- Thanks.
- You here for the party?

33:08.240 --> 33:10.435
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. Wait, can I come with you?

33:11.640 --> 33:14.916
Seriously, it would mean so much to me.
It really is my favorite show.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.752
Take advantage, kid.
You're only a teen idol once.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.718
- Thanks, buddy.
- Thanks too.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.590
I can't believe we're watching dailies.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.115
But, seriously, which take
did you like better?

33:28.280 --> 33:31.670
Because I kind of like the acting
in that one, you know.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.434
But the lighting wasn't as good
as the one before.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.831
Okay, I don't know. Could we go back
to the party? This is boring.

33:38.080 --> 33:41.390
Well, how about some music?

33:42.000 --> 33:45.197
That'll liven it up. Little party in here.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.157
Party in my Caddy.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.392
- What's this?
- This is my band.

33:50.560 --> 33:53.154
- It's our first CD.
- No kidding.

33:54.040 --> 33:59.114
I like you. I don't know why,
but you just... You've got...

33:59.280 --> 34:04.479
You just got something, you know?
I'm a big fan of yours.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.516
- Oh, my God. What are you doing?
- What...?

34:09.679 --> 34:11.079
- Cohen.
- Summer.

34:11.239 --> 34:13.958
- Hi.
- Hi. I heard really awful music...

34:14.120 --> 34:17.317
...and I knew it could only be
self-indulgent actors with instruments.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.152
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

34:19.320 --> 34:22.039
- Grady, there you are.
- April, hi.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.190
Oh, my God. You're on the show.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.237
- You're the best thing on the show.
- What are you doing with her?

34:27.400 --> 34:31.712
- I...
- Wait. You two are dating? Oh, God.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.472
Don't you think that's a bad idea?

34:33.639 --> 34:36.029
What if things don't work out
and you guys break up?

34:36.199 --> 34:38.395
- Isn't that bad for the show?
- Guess we're about to find out.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.916
Whoa... April! Hey, lock up
the car for me, please.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.513
April, wait.

34:44.520 --> 34:45.748
Hey.

34:50.360 --> 34:54.239
I'm sorry. Let's go home.
Someplace with real people.

34:54.400 --> 34:58.234
Think we'll find that at home? We live in
Newport Beach. Let's just get out of L.A.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.879
<i>I love her, and she loves me.</i>

35:00.040 --> 35:01.871
Is that a new episode?

35:02.040 --> 35:04.679
- Oh, Grady's probably ad-libbing.
- I already saw it.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.071
- What are you guys doing?
- Come with us.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.232
Your whole "save the stripper" campaign
is sweet, but I'm fine.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.435
- Oh, you're fine?
- Yeah.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.556
Get out of here quick,
before he sees you.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.312
No, not without you.
Look, we came...

35:20.480 --> 35:22.630
- What you doing in my club?
- Get your hand off me.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.109
Gonna have a problem now. Out.
You too, Hailey.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.514
Goodbye. Goodbye, Hailey.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.352
What are you gonna do now, big shot?
What are you gonna do now?

35:32.520 --> 35:34.112
What are you gonna do, hit a kid?

35:34.760 --> 35:35.954
Dad?

35:36.360 --> 35:39.875
- What are you, the dad?
- What are you?

35:40.040 --> 35:42.759
The guy who's my age
and still thinks he's 25?

35:46.280 --> 35:48.316
You keep your kids out of my club.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.676
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

35:53.920 --> 35:57.549
- Look, Sandy got held up, so...
- That's okay. Thank you.

35:58.360 --> 36:01.477
Why don't you guys head back.
I'm gonna give Hailey a lift.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.630
Okay, we'll just go find Seth and Summer.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.199
All right.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.392
Drive safe.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.315
I wish you would've called first.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.277
I would've washed my hair.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.149
Are you okay?

36:23.560 --> 36:24.959
I'm fine.

36:25.120 --> 36:29.159
I just was supposed to get a job
managing this other bar...

36:29.320 --> 36:30.469
...and it fell through...

36:30.640 --> 36:32.949
...and I needed money...
- It's okay. It's okay.

36:33.680 --> 36:36.035
It's all right. It doesn't matter.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.508
It doesn't matter.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.553
So you wanna come home?

36:48.520 --> 36:49.669
Yeah.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.510
And could we have parked
any further away?

36:57.680 --> 37:01.434
Hey. We get to look forward to a little
Saturday-night rush hour.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.909
You know, I think we did
pretty good in there, man.

37:04.080 --> 37:07.072
I told you we make a good team.
I'm the brains, you're the brawn.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.674
How come you're the brains?
I talked us back into the club.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.512
I'm sorry. I'm the brains.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.432
- You can be the beauty.
- Okay, thanks.

37:13.680 --> 37:15.989
You're the beauty, he's the brawn,
I'm the brains.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.435
Great. And what am I, Cohen?

37:18.720 --> 37:21.393
- The boobs? The bitch?
- Okay.

37:21.560 --> 37:24.472
- I'll take "the boobs."
- Hey, so will I.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.470
I've never seen so much meat loaf
in my life.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.278
It was a beautiful sight.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.557
Hey. Where were you? It went great.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.792
I have a surprise.

37:44.840 --> 37:45.989
Oh, my God.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.151
Yeah. I just picked her up
from the airport.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.880
- Fresh from Turks and Caicos.
- I hear that's the best Club Med there is.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.871
I can't wait to hear the details.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.031
Thanks, Jimmy.
For bringing her back.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.433
- Why don't I draw you a bath.
- Yeah.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.117
Well, we should wrap this up.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.710
- Do some business.
- And there is my cue.

38:21.880 --> 38:26.158
You boys discuss the money.
Call me when you want to discuss linens.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.393
Okay, fellas, I'm in.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.198
- And we'll do it your way.
- It's the only way we could do it.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.269
You guys were right.
At the end of the day...

38:35.440 --> 38:37.829
...it's good food, good people
coming together.

38:38.840 --> 38:42.594
- Tonight was a good start.
- Apparently.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.039
Thanks.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.113
- Luke, what is so important that...?
- We can't do this anymore.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.508
Excuse me?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.516
You're breaking up with me?

38:58.440 --> 39:01.955
It's just...
It's not a good idea.

39:02.120 --> 39:04.350
And it never could've worked.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.759
You're right.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.638
Well, okay.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.798
Right.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.389
Okay.

39:35.920 --> 39:38.388
Hi, Cal. It's me.

39:38.560 --> 39:41.313
When you're ready for that date,
let me know.

39:42.520 --> 39:45.114
Can't believe they're watching
<i>The Valley</i> after all that.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.396
Hey, Summer says it's addictive.

39:47.560 --> 39:50.393
So is it okay if I hang out in here?
Not watching TV?

39:50.560 --> 39:51.993
Yeah, sure.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.912
So did you have fun tonight?

40:00.080 --> 40:02.833
Watching you get kicked
out of a club? Twice?

40:03.000 --> 40:06.231
- Yeah, actually, I kind of did.
- You were pretty good with the bouncer.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.719
- Impressed?
- I kind of was.

40:07.880 --> 40:10.599
- See, I think I should be the brains.
- No. Seth's the brains.

40:10.760 --> 40:13.752
- Well, you're clearly not the beauty.
- And now someone's the bitch.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.394
- Oh, really? Okay.
- Yeah.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.119
Hey, hey.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.039
- Come on, fight back.
- All right.

40:21.960 --> 40:25.316
- I win.
- Yeah. Yeah, you win.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.391
I'll be right back.

40:31.560 --> 40:35.235
- Hey, Mrs. Cohen. Is Ryan around?
- Yeah. He's in the pool house.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.039
- Luke.
- It's over.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.270
- I'm done having sex with Julie Cooper.
- Okay.

40:47.400 --> 40:48.992
Marissa.

40:55.080 --> 40:59.119
- You...
- Okay. Wait, wait. Just stop.

41:01.280 --> 41:02.429
Marissa.

41:02.840 --> 41:05.991
- So that's why you took me to L.A.?
- I didn't want you to find out.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.718
Not like this.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.831
I've gotta go.

41:14.305 --> 41:20.533
