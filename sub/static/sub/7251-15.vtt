01:24.290 --> 01:25.259
Don't.

01:26.223 --> 01:28.711
- You okay? 
- Well, you hurt my feelings just now.

01:28.792 --> 01:30.681
No, I mean you doing okay with everything?

01:30.844 --> 01:32.944
You're referring to my meltdown in the park.

01:33.058 --> 01:35.166
- It wasn't a meltdown. 
- Oh, it was a meltdown.

01:35.279 --> 01:37.481
They're making it into a movie -- "Meltdown in the Park."

01:37.597 --> 01:39.897
Don't worry, it's just a working title. Baz Luhrmann's directing.

01:39.994 --> 01:42.867
- And the movie Luke wears tights and sings. 
- But you're okay?

01:42.965 --> 01:45.243
- Thanks to my knight in shining armor. 
- Ah, well…

01:45.355 --> 01:48.120
I just hope Alec Baldwin captures your rare essence.

01:48.213 --> 01:51.054
And slims down a little for the role. I should deliver these.

01:51.227 --> 01:53.814
- Can I work on my laptop? 
- Does it make noise?

01:53.968 --> 01:55.635
- No, but I sometimes do. 
- You always do.

02:01.058 --> 02:01.924
- Kirk. 
- Luke.

02:02.047 --> 02:03.338
- What's with the... 
- It's not a purse!

02:03.439 --> 02:05.503
- I wasn't gonna say "purse." 
- Oh… Sorry.

02:05.594 --> 02:07.761
- What's with the gay bag? 
- It's a dog carrier.

02:08.125 --> 02:12.333
My girlfriend's gone out of town with some friends, and I'm watching Buster for her.

02:12.527 --> 02:14.340
And they're girlfriends, not guys.

02:14.559 --> 02:18.062
I called the hotel she booked and verified that it's a girl's name on the register with her.

02:18.728 --> 02:20.494
- Not that I don't trust her. 
- Clearly.

02:20.673 --> 02:22.004
- Over there okay? 
- Sure.

02:22.661 --> 02:26.402
Carol, Danny, Jamie, Sean, Chris?

02:26.500 --> 02:27.233
What's that?

02:27.354 --> 02:29.879
Just a list of guys' names that could be girls. You want coffee?

02:33.721 --> 02:35.444
- What is this? 
- Phone cord.

02:35.521 --> 02:37.298
- I can't have this here. 
- Don't worry.

02:37.486 --> 02:38.972
It's not plugged in to your regular line.

02:39.054 --> 02:41.824
It's the fax line you put in a year ago that you never use.

02:41.902 --> 02:44.666
You mean the fax line you made me put in to get in fax orders,

02:44.777 --> 02:47.917
even though no one has ever wanted to put in a fax order,

02:47.978 --> 02:50.498
and I never got the fax machine, like I told you I would never, ever 

02:50.621 --> 02:54.215
get the fax machine, making the fax line pointless.

02:54.475 --> 02:57.036
Hold on… Let me get on the "Guinness World Records" website.

02:57.930 --> 03:01.618
Yes, that's the most times anyone has ever used the word "fax" in a sentence.

03:01.725 --> 03:04.194
- Just be quick with this. 
- Man, I love e-mail.

03:04.372 --> 03:06.968
Every day Rory and I write each other multiple times. It's great.

03:07.071 --> 03:09.288
You enjoy typing to people more than talking to them?

03:09.384 --> 03:12.411
Wrong perspective. E-mail is a return to the romantic days of letter writing.

03:12.477 --> 03:14.674
- It's pure Dickens. 
- Why Dickens?

03:14.987 --> 03:18.319
It's just when I picture letter writing, I picture Charles Dickens.

03:18.437 --> 03:20.875
Charles Dickens wrote more letters than other people?

03:20.976 --> 03:24.893
No, it's just I can easily picture him in his study with his dog

03:24.956 --> 03:27.981
and his pipe and his fancy feathered pen, writing

03:28.243 --> 03:31.986
"Cheerio, old bean. Have a cup of tea. How's Big Ben?

03:32.093 --> 03:36.251
How's the Tower of London, Sister Suffragette? Tuppence a bag."

03:36.368 --> 03:37.455
Sounds like an idiot.

03:38.022 --> 03:40.977
- Hey, Luke, coffee? 
- Oh, this is embarrassing.

03:41.073 --> 03:43.869
I could unplug, but then I'd just have to start the whole process all over again.

03:43.972 --> 03:46.250
Or you could just eat here and save e-mailing for when you're...

03:49.859 --> 03:50.555
Excuse me.

03:56.073 --> 03:58.389
- You have a dog there? 
- No. Why?

03:58.831 --> 04:00.172
Just putting two and two together.

04:00.464 --> 04:03.336
Well, it's coming out five. Buster is at home, asleep.

04:04.447 --> 04:06.413
Okay. What'll you have?

04:06.792 --> 04:11.293
Oatmeal, extra brown sugar on the side, and a pound of raw hamburger.

04:12.383 --> 04:14.108
Or just the oatmeal will be fine.

04:19.637 --> 04:21.353
- Voila! 
- This does nothing.

04:21.482 --> 04:25.235
- It makes it easier to limbo under. 
- This is my place. I shouldn't have to limbo.

04:25.705 --> 04:27.093
You still sleepy?

04:27.191 --> 04:31.143
- Why is Kirk talking to his man purse? 
- You got sleepy face. You have to tinkle?

04:34.906 --> 04:40.154
Where is that? Just looking for my Lucky magazine, and...

04:42.283 --> 04:43.594
Paper cut.

05:47.938 --> 05:49.393
- What are you doing? 
- Getting a drink.

05:49.479 --> 05:50.902
- You're sick. 
- Hence the fluids.

05:51.071 --> 05:52.783
When you came out of our room, did you use the doorknob?

05:53.025 --> 05:55.798
As opposed to dematerializing, passing vapor-like through the wall,

05:55.870 --> 05:58.024
then rematerializing out here? No, I used the doorknob.

05:58.168 --> 06:00.626
For the love of God, I begged you not to touch anything.

06:00.714 --> 06:02.279
I'm not contagious anymore.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.725
- Paris, stop! 
- I'm not getting sick.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.486
That's your deodorant.

06:07.865 --> 06:09.391
Then what the hell did I spray under my arms?

06:09.635 --> 06:10.312
That's mine.

06:14.379 --> 06:15.740
- Hello. 
- Guess where I'm standing.

06:15.841 --> 06:17.532
I don't know but you sound a little echoey.

06:17.742 --> 06:20.297
I'm standing in the living room of my very own apartment!

06:20.400 --> 06:22.263
- You're kidding. 
- I'm waiting for the gas man.

06:22.350 --> 06:23.686
The gas man! Isn't that great?

06:23.846 --> 06:26.564
I've got gas! Ignore the word. Just focus on the enthusiasm.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.554
- How are you affording this? 
- I'm sharing it with Zack and Brian.

06:29.978 --> 06:32.048
- You're living with the band? 
- It's totally innocent,

06:32.134 --> 06:34.168
I have my own room, and they're gonna sleep in the living room.

06:34.285 --> 06:36.861
That is so cool. When do you move your stuff in?

06:36.948 --> 06:40.695
Tomorrow. That is if my mom hasn't sold it all by now. Hey, you sound a little stuffed.

06:40.783 --> 06:44.536
I've been sick, but it's mostly deodorant stench I'm suffering from at the moment.

06:44.648 --> 06:48.648
Oh, my God! My first mail is here! It's a Chinese menu.

06:48.764 --> 06:51.468
- Frame it or something. 
- I will. I've gotta go, I'll call you later.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.329
- Oh, that's not dangerous. 
- Fire kills germs.

06:55.785 --> 06:58.850
- And I'm sleeping with one of the other girls tonight. 
- How very "The L Word".

07:04.550 --> 07:05.277
You done?

07:05.441 --> 07:08.610
Oh yes, your limboing days are over, my friend. Thanks for putting up with me.

07:08.708 --> 07:10.771
- Well, I only fell once. 
- And gracefully. Bye.

07:10.878 --> 07:12.367
- Wait a minute. Hold on. 
- Why?

07:15.282 --> 07:18.102
- You're making me nervous. 
- Just... here.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.964
- What's this? 
- It's what it is.

07:21.465 --> 07:23.437
- "A monk, a trunk, and a skunk." 
- What are you doing?

07:23.546 --> 07:25.947
Carnak, although I don't have a punch line. Never stopped Johnny.

07:26.034 --> 07:28.005
- Put that down. Hide it. 
- What is it?

07:28.772 --> 07:29.664
Open it later.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.400
A check to me for $30,000.

07:38.420 --> 07:40.272
Luke, this is the money I was gonna ask you for.

07:40.790 --> 07:44.897
- And you did ask, and there it is. 
- But I didn't. Not officially.

07:45.029 --> 07:48.884
I blubbered an amount to you, and we didn't get to talk about a repayment schedule.

07:48.988 --> 07:50.704
- It's okay. 
- Or interest or collateral.

07:50.825 --> 07:54.107
I had charts and projections. I wanted to take you out to a nice dinner.

07:54.226 --> 07:55.572
So send me a Honeybaked Ham.

07:55.638 --> 07:58.296
But this is wrong. This is not how you do these things.

07:58.450 --> 08:01.066
I don't know how to do these things. Will you just take the money?

08:01.291 --> 08:03.569
I'm sorry, we at least have to go over the basics.

08:05.089 --> 08:06.032
I don't want to read that.

08:06.815 --> 08:08.731
Well, I'm not leaving until you read this napkin.

08:11.004 --> 08:14.107
Fine. Okay? That's okay. That's too much.

08:16.129 --> 08:19.498
- That's sufficient. 
- Okay, but what about this?

08:20.005 --> 08:21.976
- Nicole?! 
- Hey! I thought we were writing and sliding.

08:22.084 --> 08:22.913
What about Nicole?

08:23.215 --> 08:25.478
- I need to know her role. 
- There is none.

08:25.647 --> 08:28.283
Luke, if it's joint money, then I should acknowledge that

08:28.351 --> 08:30.266
- and thank her the next time I see her… 
- You're not gonna see her.

08:30.339 --> 08:31.981
Now, can we stop talking about this whole thing?

08:32.134 --> 08:36.817
Okay, but I insist on typing up something legal and binding for this loan.

08:36.885 --> 08:39.989
Okay. I really just don't want to talk about this anymore.

08:40.121 --> 08:45.549
- We'll dot the Is and cross the Ts another day. 
- Yes, we'll cross and dot.

08:45.744 --> 08:48.933
- I just have to write down one more thing. 
- What! What is so important now?

08:53.136 --> 08:53.936
You're welcome.

09:03.095 --> 09:05.579
Gilmore -- Richard and Emily Gilmore.

09:06.050 --> 09:08.897
Look, we single-handedly put your restaurant on the map

09:08.977 --> 09:12.623
by praising your crab puffs at Eunice Pierpont Pennington's granddaughter's christening.

09:12.812 --> 09:13.514
Hi, Mom.

09:14.523 --> 09:17.139
Oh, really? You're new there? Because your deft handling of this phone call

09:17.222 --> 09:19.761
displays all the signs of a seasoned and experienced hand.

09:20.607 --> 09:23.298
Yes, go get Trey. That's a smashing idea.

09:23.846 --> 09:25.420
- Painful hello. 
- What's going on?

09:25.926 --> 09:28.420
You couldn't see the smoke from Stars Hollow? Lettie burned the entrée.

09:28.645 --> 09:30.466
Beyond edibility? 'Cause I'm not picky.

09:30.626 --> 09:32.662
No, I could not expose you to such a loin.

09:32.811 --> 09:34.470
- Oh, if I had a nickel. 
- What?

09:34.599 --> 09:35.705
So you had a burning loin.

09:35.869 --> 09:38.566
And now I'm fighting to squeeze us into somewhere appropriate.

09:38.721 --> 09:40.369
Someone to take pity on the loinless.

09:40.866 --> 09:42.678
- Is that how you're dressed? 
- Is this a trick question?

09:42.862 --> 09:46.001
-  It's really not appropriate to go out in. 
- Well, I did not foresee your burning loin.

09:46.139 --> 09:48.479
- Stop saying that word. 
- When will I get this chance again?

09:48.623 --> 09:51.346
I've seen that on you a dozen times. You really should update your wardrobe.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.811
My wardrobe is fine, Mom.

09:53.057 --> 09:54.977
The summer lines are coming out. You should hit a store.

09:55.126 --> 09:56.820
No need for you to hit any more stores, Emily.

09:56.907 --> 10:00.209
You've done enough shopping for a lifetime. For Methuselah's lifetime.

10:00.368 --> 10:01.895
- Hello, Lorelai. 
- Hi, Dad.

10:02.016 --> 10:06.241
- I didn't say I was going shopping, Richard. 
- It's an instinct that requires no verbalization.

10:06.435 --> 10:09.293
I was suggesting that your daughter update her wardrobe.

10:09.388 --> 10:12.011
- No need to spread your disease either. 
- Richard!

10:12.129 --> 10:15.917
Really Dad, don't read more into this than what it is: just humiliating me.

10:16.296 --> 10:18.623
I should hang up and let you both starve.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.602
What do you mean, starve? What happened to dinner?

10:20.832 --> 10:23.132
I told you not five minutes ago that dinner was ruined.

10:23.233 --> 10:24.254
- Did you? 
- Yes.

10:24.612 --> 10:27.299
I heard the word "loin," but I didn't think you meant dinner.

10:27.463 --> 10:28.851
This is making me very uncomfortable.

10:28.974 --> 10:30.710
That's because you half listen to everything I say.

10:31.329 --> 10:34.099
Yes, I'm still here. Good, check with him.

10:34.339 --> 10:35.932
I think we have a shot at Bastide.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.421
- Isn't that a little drab? 
- We love Bastide.

10:38.559 --> 10:42.131
You love Bastide. Why don't we try that place Jason took me to last week?

10:42.321 --> 10:46.372
A lot of hip clientele. He pointed out Moby to me. He's that bald musician.

10:46.490 --> 10:48.998
- Yep, that's pretty hip, Dad. 
- When did you have dinner with Moby?

10:49.142 --> 10:52.890
Moby was just there. Jason played me some of his music later. I liked it.

10:53.064 --> 10:55.276
We're going to Bastide, but don't fret.

10:55.367 --> 10:57.851
Maybe the Beatles will be there and you can sit in and jam with them.

10:58.369 --> 11:01.271
- Two of the Beatles are dead, Emily. 
- Only one is dead.

11:01.584 --> 11:04.762
No, a second Beatle died just recently. Lorelai?

11:04.906 --> 11:06.821
Could you press the "pause" button on this conversation?

11:06.919 --> 11:08.988
I really want Rory to hear the rest of it.

11:09.089 --> 11:11.357
If we're going to Bastide, you should change your jacket, Richard.

11:11.977 --> 11:12.795
All right.

11:13.262 --> 11:15.629
And please shave that moustache, I beg of you.

11:15.765 --> 11:18.827
I want to see what it looks like fully grown, Emily. That was the agreement.

11:18.961 --> 11:22.477
Well, it looks like a caterpillar now. In two weeks it'll look like a bigger caterpillar.

11:22.586 --> 11:24.798
- Very funny. 
- I'm not trying to be funny.

11:25.079 --> 11:27.014
I will shave it when I shave it.

11:27.163 --> 11:31.643
Yes. Yes, we'll be there. Thank you. Wait! They said they can take us

11:31.735 --> 11:34.413
if we can be there in five minutes and order as quickly as possible.

11:34.504 --> 11:36.703
- Well it'll take longer than that. 
- Not if we move.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.458
- What about my jacket? 
- Doesn't matter.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.460
- They'll be staring at your moustache. 
- Emily.

11:40.546 --> 11:42.395
Come on. Scoot, scoot. And be thinking about what you want.

11:42.482 --> 11:45.002
Whoa, just one little problem here. Rory?

11:45.180 --> 11:46.516
- What about her? 
- She's not here yet.

11:46.655 --> 11:48.011
- She's not coming. 
- She's not coming?

11:48.175 --> 11:50.874
No, she's been sick all week. I told her to stay in her dorm and rest.

11:51.033 --> 11:52.681
- She's been sick? 
- Didn't you know?

11:52.820 --> 11:54.161
Oh, yeah, I knew.

11:54.341 --> 11:55.994
I'm having sea bass. Think, think.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.410
I knew it.

12:10.468 --> 12:12.670
- Hello? 
- We have an e-mail relationship.

12:13.818 --> 12:16.971
- She speaks. She has the ability. 
- What's wrong?

12:17.099 --> 12:18.599
Are you okay? Are you sick?

12:18.753 --> 12:20.212
I'm getting over a cold. You knew that.

12:20.453 --> 12:23.545
No, I didn't, because our once-wonderful relationship,

12:23.653 --> 12:26.863
envy of all the world, more intimate than that of the naked couple

12:26.934 --> 12:30.581
in the "love is..." cartoons, has degenerated into e-mail correspondence.

12:30.677 --> 12:33.039
- I'm sure I wrote that I had a cold. 
- No, you didn't.

12:33.217 --> 12:34.918
In all those e-mails, I didn't mention it?

12:35.061 --> 12:38.431
All those e-mails? I'm sorry, but you write less than the people

12:38.486 --> 12:40.641
offering to enlarge a piece of anatomy I do not possess.

12:40.722 --> 12:41.767
I could have sworn I told you.

12:41.865 --> 12:44.829
I just reread every e-mail you sent in the past ten days. No sickness mention,

12:44.912 --> 12:49.904
but you did share these gems: "Hey, what up? Is it freezing there, too? Ice."

12:50.374 --> 12:54.117
And, "Whew. Pooped." Then you added one of those obnoxious hieroglyphics

12:54.183 --> 12:56.093
that I can never read that are supposed to indicate you're laughing

12:56.185 --> 12:58.213
or smiling or frowning or vomiting. I don't know what.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.296
That's a typo. I don't do cutesy symbols.

13:00.405 --> 13:04.954
You're not even using verbs. That's not a relationship. Relationships need verbs.

13:05.049 --> 13:07.179
- Well yours aren't much better. 
- I'm not saying they are.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.393
- I can never get you on the phone. 
- I can never get you!

13:10.475 --> 13:12.170
- You got me now. 
- Freak of nature.

13:12.267 --> 13:13.614
What do you look like. Do you look the same?

13:13.738 --> 13:15.877
- Hold on. My nose ring is itching. 
- Don't kid.

13:16.020 --> 13:19.958
I'm mad and needy, and I ended up going out to dinner alone with my parents,

13:20.041 --> 13:23.014
who bickered the whole time about which Beatle is alive and which is dead.

13:23.189 --> 13:25.836
- So, where'd they land? 
- John and Keith are dead.

13:25.928 --> 13:29.118
Paul and Bingo are still kicking. Play hooky tomorrow.

13:29.296 --> 13:30.951
- From what? 
- I don't know.

13:31.022 --> 13:34.351
Whatever you got. I know you're always busy, but let's do something.

13:34.473 --> 13:36.793
- What about the inn? 
- They can live without me for a day.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.306
- Tomorrow's actually good. 
- Really?

13:39.409 --> 13:41.407
There's a newspaper thing, but I can skip that.

13:41.534 --> 13:43.459
- Cool! What do we do? 
- I don't know.

13:43.550 --> 13:45.774
Mom said the summer clothing lines are out.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.985
Want to go shopping? We haven't done that in ages.

13:48.099 --> 13:50.422
- But we're both totally skint. 
- Huh? We're what?

13:50.530 --> 13:52.184
We're skint -- broke. It's British.

13:52.312 --> 13:55.230
Oh man, you've learned to speak British. I didn't even know about it.

13:55.363 --> 13:56.264
You know what I mean.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.609
So we won't buy anything. We'll just window-shop.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.236
- That could be fun. 
- It'll be like we're in an old movie, y'know?

14:01.380 --> 14:05.691
Walking around, window-shopping like Roz Russell and Ava Gardner on Fifth Avenue.

14:05.748 --> 14:08.071
- I'm with you. 
- Meet me at the inn, 10:00?

14:08.179 --> 14:10.969
But it's been so long. How will we recognize each other?

14:11.092 --> 14:14.196
- We'll wear a rose in our lapels. 
- Or dangling from my nose ring.

14:14.278 --> 14:16.729
- You're kidding about that, right? 
- I'm leaving you in suspense.

14:16.807 --> 14:19.627
- Tomorrow at 10:00, Roz darling? 
- Till tomorrow, Ava dearest.

14:28.225 --> 14:29.385
Look out. Coming through.

14:30.205 --> 14:31.415
What's with all the dogs, Kirk?

14:31.562 --> 14:33.770
Well, people in town saw how good I was with Lulu's dog

14:33.846 --> 14:36.519
that they asked me to watch theirs -- for a fee, of course.

14:36.975 --> 14:38.377
- What are you looking for? 
- Shh. Come on.

14:39.678 --> 14:42.755
It's a game I'm playing with the dogs -- tracker.

14:42.996 --> 14:46.953
See, I cut one of them loose, and then the rest of us hide until we get tracked down.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.232
- At the moment, we're hiding from Snuggles. 
- We are?

14:49.354 --> 14:53.317
It helps them hone their tracking skills, and the kids love it.

14:53.410 --> 14:55.775
- What kids? 
- The babies. The dogs.

14:56.155 --> 14:59.426
- You ever the one that gets cut loose? 
- I've gone twice. Shh. Snuggles.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.007
Cute, but not the smartest tool in the shed.

15:09.354 --> 15:11.821
He found us! Celebrate!

15:12.446 --> 15:13.762
Come on, Luke. Celebrate!

15:14.259 --> 15:16.608
- I'll have a beer tonight. 
- Beer? Oh, no!

15:17.094 --> 15:20.787
We don't like beer. Beer is bad. Cookies! Cookies!

15:30.040 --> 15:31.749
- Hi, Rory. 
- Hi, Tom. How's it going?

15:31.842 --> 15:33.551
- Not half bad. 
- Then it's half good.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.797
- That makes it sound better than it is. 
- Kinda the point.

15:35.907 --> 15:38.799
- What's with the flower? 
- It's so my Mom and I will recognize each other.

15:38.926 --> 15:39.951
- Girl thing? 
- Yeah.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.933
- I'm not into girl things. 
- You're a contractor.

15:42.041 --> 15:42.891
Yep. Later.

15:45.251 --> 15:46.992
Oh, excuse me. Can I have your autograph?

15:47.692 --> 15:48.262
What?

15:48.471 --> 15:50.524
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were one of the Village People.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.631
- I'm kidding. I'm a kidder. 
- What are you doing here?

15:53.750 --> 15:55.685
I'm meeting my mom here. We're playing hooky.

15:55.767 --> 15:57.878
- The flower's a private joke for her? 
- You know me well.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.686
Yeah, I do. So, you okay and all?

16:01.842 --> 16:04.097
Yeah. Oh, that. I'm fine now.

16:04.364 --> 16:08.255
A little nervous breakdown can really work wonders for a girl.

16:08.391 --> 16:11.353
- I didn't mean to lay all that on you. 
- That's what shoulders are for.

16:11.732 --> 16:13.830
You've got a heck of an understanding shoulder.

16:14.091 --> 16:16.292
- Hey, you want to hammer something? 
- Always.

16:16.565 --> 16:17.804
- Be my guest. 
- Really?

16:17.958 --> 16:20.425
Yeah, Tom went outside. Do it. Go on.

16:20.599 --> 16:23.098
I feel like I should spit or hike up my shorts or something.

16:27.728 --> 16:28.730
You're a natural.

16:28.894 --> 16:30.803
I think I must have been a carpenter in another life,

16:30.941 --> 16:32.678
or just someone who really hated nails.

16:33.189 --> 16:34.965
- Hi, Rory. 
- Oh, hi, Lindsay.

16:37.803 --> 16:39.728
- Are we early? 
- No, not at all.

16:39.913 --> 16:42.190
Mom and I just wanted to get a nice jump on things today.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.084
Did Lindsay tell you we found a new dry cleaner?

16:44.187 --> 16:45.457
- No. 
- Tell him, Lindsay!

16:45.605 --> 16:47.648
They use less solvent, so it's cleaner.

16:47.956 --> 16:51.177
- I'm really into the environment. 
- Oh, me too.

16:51.339 --> 16:54.604
- So, are you working here? 
- No, that was illegal hammering.

16:54.724 --> 16:57.479
Completely nonunion. Come the revolution, I shall be shot.

16:57.612 --> 16:59.374
Let's set up lunch before everything gets cold.

16:59.511 --> 17:02.430
- Lunch? This early? 
- Our Deano's up at 5:00.

17:02.675 --> 17:03.587
Deano?

17:04.237 --> 17:07.048
Don't worry. Mom made lunch today, so it's safe to eat.

17:07.489 --> 17:09.700
Lindsay's mom is teaching her how to cook.

17:10.392 --> 17:13.981
- It's hard. Do you know how? 
- If you count radiator quesadillas.

17:14.108 --> 17:15.958
I should have started teaching you sooner.

17:16.095 --> 17:17.836
Don't make that mistake with your little one.

17:26.763 --> 17:29.700
You're never going to attract a man looking like that.

17:29.801 --> 17:31.650
- Over here, biddy bidster. 
- Oh, bye.

17:32.193 --> 17:35.209
- Hi. Oh, you wore a rose! 
- That was the agreement.

17:35.270 --> 17:37.763
- Hey, Lindsay. Hey, Theresa. 
- Hi.

17:38.194 --> 17:39.197
- You ready? 
- Let's go.

17:39.354 --> 17:41.204
Hey, how often does this happen?

17:41.363 --> 17:45.981
Oh, well, it's a hot lunch every day. Plus they always bring something for the group.

17:46.047 --> 17:48.126
Yesterday it was peanut brittle Lindsay made.

17:48.270 --> 17:51.710
It broke a crown, three teeth, then a HazMat team came and took it away.

17:58.346 --> 18:00.710
They put everything on pretzels nowadays. I love that

18:00.830 --> 18:03.083
- You're our new best friend, Howard. 
- We don't say that to just anybody.

18:03.190 --> 18:04.531
Just anybody holding free food.

18:04.719 --> 18:06.231
- We'll be back. 
- Stock up.

18:07.030 --> 18:09.522
- Okay, here we go. 
- Where should we start?

18:09.702 --> 18:11.910
Well, we're window-shopping, so let's find a window.

18:12.084 --> 18:13.895
I see rows and rows of windows.

18:14.115 --> 18:18.365
Hey, let's walk arm in arm like window-shopping ladies do in movies.

18:18.457 --> 18:19.124
You got it.

18:19.353 --> 18:20.992
I wish I'd brought a xylophone with me.

18:21.196 --> 18:24.252
There's always a bouncy xylophone playing when movie girls window-shop.

18:24.510 --> 18:27.479
- So, left or right? 
- Let's go right.

18:31.617 --> 18:32.456
Oh, cool.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.108
- Oh, that would look great on you. 
- I love blue.

18:35.390 --> 18:38.087
You should make a mental note to get that when you're back in the cash.

18:38.231 --> 18:38.814
Done.

18:39.327 --> 18:40.806
- Shall we? 
- Let's shall.

18:41.758 --> 18:42.424
Oh, sorry.

18:43.244 --> 18:45.047
One of the risks of linked-arm walking.

18:56.822 --> 18:58.455
- Lane. 
- Hello.

18:59.116 --> 19:00.794
- Come in. 
- Thank you.

19:05.362 --> 19:07.026
- Hello, Aunt Jun. 
- Hello.

19:07.471 --> 19:09.836
Your Aunt Jun brought your cousin Christine to help with your move.

19:10.032 --> 19:10.943
Say hello to Christine.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.790
- Hello, Christine. 
- Hello, Lane.

19:13.902 --> 19:17.168
Jun and I will remain down here while you move. You may use whatever boxes you need,

19:17.241 --> 19:20.915
plus bubble wrap and tape. Just write down what you take for inventory purposes.

19:21.050 --> 19:22.509
- I will. Thank you. 
- You're welcome.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.460
Go with Lane, Christine.

19:35.310 --> 19:38.177
I don't believe it! You're moving! What happened? Tell me everything!

19:38.228 --> 19:39.583
Was there a fight? Are you getting married?

19:39.784 --> 19:42.223
No female Kim has ever moved out without getting married.

19:42.294 --> 19:43.486
You're not getting married, right?

19:43.763 --> 19:47.234
I love the floorboard thing! It's so "Hogan's Heroes!"

19:47.332 --> 19:50.291
I wonder if I can pull up the floorboards at my house. Have you heard of the Libertines?

19:50.368 --> 19:52.512
What about the White Stripes? Is it over for them?

19:52.671 --> 19:55.626
What about Zeppelin? I'm getting more retro. What's a good Zeppelin?

19:55.707 --> 19:58.432
"II," "III"? "III"'s got "Stairway to Heaven," right?

19:58.585 --> 20:01.253
Man, it's like a funeral down there. I thought my mom was harsh,

20:01.315 --> 20:04.372
but your mom makes the guy from Joy Division look like one of the Teletubbies.

20:04.443 --> 20:07.585
Are you taking all of this? Is she going through the boxes before you leave?

20:07.719 --> 20:10.345
Where do you buy the CDs with the swear words? Did you buy them in disguise?

20:10.413 --> 20:12.072
Did someone buy them for you? Have you ever...

20:12.173 --> 20:15.901
Hey Kid, do I look green and wrinkly to you? No? That's right. I'm not Yoda.

20:15.994 --> 20:18.226
So if you're looking for a mentor, call the Dalai Lama.

20:18.312 --> 20:22.731
What I'm here to do is get my stuff and split. Now be quiet and start assembling boxes.

20:22.992 --> 20:26.007
And "Stairway to Heaven" is from "Led Zeppelin IV."

20:26.081 --> 20:28.363
If you're going to get into classic rock, know it, don't blow it!

20:33.801 --> 20:36.074
Do you have a car? Are you getting a car? Do you have a license?

20:36.171 --> 20:38.260
Are Kims allowed to drive? I'm dying to drive.

20:40.852 --> 20:42.322
I left the inventory list in the room.

20:42.970 --> 20:44.890
- Very good. 
- I guess I'll be going.

20:47.135 --> 20:49.647
Step away from Lane, Christine.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.991
- Oh, that's nice. 
- Which?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.588
- That. 
- The skirt and the blouse?

21:07.721 --> 21:09.651
- Yeah. More the skirt than the blouse. 
- I like them both.

21:09.758 --> 21:10.563
Good colors

21:11.081 --> 21:13.154
- Oh, they have nice-looking jackets. 
- Where?

21:13.303 --> 21:15.314
- In the back there. 
- Oh, cute.

21:15.572 --> 21:18.299
- Mental note. 
- Absolutely. Next window?

21:19.016 --> 21:19.844
Sure.

21:21.356 --> 21:24.516
- Okay, this sucks. 
- Completely.

21:24.597 --> 21:28.181
This is the least amount of fun I've ever had, barring the time we went to Mummenschanz.

21:28.248 --> 21:31.291
- Oh, this is way less fun. 
- Window-shopping? What was I thinking?

21:31.376 --> 21:33.364
But it sounds fun. It should be fun.

21:33.496 --> 21:36.542
Not if you think about it. I mean, window-shopping is like going to a museum,

21:36.650 --> 21:38.499
but you're actually interested in what you're looking at,

21:38.606 --> 21:40.408
and everyone can buy something except for you.

21:40.540 --> 21:43.444
I've made so many mental notes in my head of things to get

21:43.537 --> 21:45.328
that I think my head has actually gotten bigger.

21:45.707 --> 21:49.296
Look at all these haughty people with their bags,

21:49.439 --> 21:52.994
just rubbing our faces in it. What were Roz Russell and Ava Gardner thinking?

21:53.085 --> 21:55.124
What movie did you see them window-shop in?

21:55.210 --> 21:57.933
I don't know that I did. I just picked two old movie-actress names.

21:58.016 --> 22:00.575
I don't know that I've seen anyone window-shop in a movie ever.

22:00.637 --> 22:03.806
So, this whole outing was a house of sand built on a foundation of straw.

22:04.155 --> 22:07.846
Hey, maybe if we went in the store, it would be better.

22:08.112 --> 22:11.169
Well, it would be way better than just pressing our noses up against the windows.

22:17.776 --> 22:18.751
Nope.

22:19.258 --> 22:20.866
- Worse! 
- Much worse.

22:21.036 --> 22:22.192
Time to pull the plug, hon.

22:22.434 --> 22:24.216
But what do we do? It's still morning.

22:24.313 --> 22:25.813
We could ride the glass elevator up and down.

22:25.951 --> 22:26.958
Oh, God, we're sad.

22:27.272 --> 22:28.716
They've got a merry-go-round.

22:28.988 --> 22:31.500
- It costs money. 
- Right, and we're skint.

22:32.012 --> 22:35.044
Plus dirty diapers have touched those seats.

22:35.208 --> 22:38.592
Well, let's just go somewhere where things are not for sale.

22:38.740 --> 22:40.844
- Let's be rid of temptation. 
- Sounds good.

22:43.313 --> 22:46.087
- Do you see Howard? 
- I see Howard, and he's got a fresh batch.

22:46.267 --> 22:47.567
I'm looking forward to Howard.

22:50.123 --> 22:51.540
- Oh, no. 
- What?

22:51.714 --> 22:53.296
- Emily. 
- Emily who?

22:53.604 --> 22:56.575
"Emily the Strange" with the black cat and the boots made for kicking. Who do you think?

22:56.830 --> 22:58.263
- Grandma's here? Are you sure? 
- Very sure.

22:58.386 --> 23:00.010
- Why are we hiding? 
- Reflex.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.839
- We have to say hello to her. 
- Why? We're two ships. We're passing.

23:02.927 --> 23:04.950
If she sees us hiding, we're going to have to explain.

23:05.057 --> 23:05.774
So hide good.

23:06.148 --> 23:07.198
Lorelai, Rory!

23:07.741 --> 23:09.512
- Mom, hi. 
- Hi, Grandma.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.806
- Meet me up here. 
- Oh, we're going down.

23:11.985 --> 23:13.855
- Meet me up here! 
- Okay.

23:14.663 --> 23:17.853
- Go down, then meet me up here! 
- Right. Coming.

23:18.344 --> 23:19.372
We stink at hiding.

23:27.892 --> 23:31.016
What are you doing here? I thought you were both swamped with work.

23:31.190 --> 23:34.461
Yes, well, Rory got a special...

23:34.575 --> 23:37.729
- The chancellor gave me a... 
- I actually was able to take...

23:37.898 --> 23:41.210
- half a day. 
- a half a day, too. And so we've...

23:41.429 --> 23:43.796
- just to spend some time. 
- We're playing hooky.

23:43.892 --> 23:45.638
Well then, just say that. How long have you been here?

23:45.725 --> 23:46.944
- Hour and a half. 
- Where are your bags?

23:47.101 --> 23:48.993
- We're just window-shopping. 
- Window-shopping?

23:49.106 --> 23:51.348
- Like Roz Russell and Ava Gardner. 
- What's the fun in that?

23:51.491 --> 23:54.199
- There's no fun in that. 
- We're thinking of suing Roz and Ava's estates.

23:54.356 --> 23:56.253
- Well, come on. 
- Oh. Ah. Where?

23:56.427 --> 23:59.047
- Shopping. Come on. Pip-pip. 
- Mom, we were just leaving.

23:59.237 --> 24:00.947
You're not leaving. Now, come on.

24:01.319 --> 24:04.756
- I guess we're following my mother. 
- She's very aggressive today.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.785
I think the passive part of her personality is playing hooky.

24:07.465 --> 24:09.074
- Come on! 
- Coming!

24:15.560 --> 24:19.006
Hey, did you guys bring silverware or drinking glasses or anything for the kitchen?

24:19.212 --> 24:19.886
I didn't.

24:20.327 --> 24:22.473
We've no bowls! We have no cups!

24:23.385 --> 24:25.310
- But we do have a him. 
- Him? Him who?

24:25.469 --> 24:27.993
- There's a him in one of the cupboards? 
- An ex-him, to be exact.

24:28.110 --> 24:30.951
He's belly-up. He was a big boy, too. A big, fat, belly-up big boy.

24:31.714 --> 24:33.507
Hey, watch it. That's my stereo!

24:33.639 --> 24:36.630
We didn't need your stereo, Brian. We've got my stereo.

24:36.799 --> 24:39.394
We've got three stereos and no forks.

24:39.574 --> 24:41.186
We're kind of lacking in shelf space.

24:41.325 --> 24:44.724
Well, maybe you should skip displaying your Futurama action figures.

24:44.822 --> 24:46.347
That might open space up a bit.

24:47.262 --> 24:49.721
There are no curtains on the windows! People can see right in.

24:49.874 --> 24:51.734
- What if we're naked? 
- Please, never be naked.

24:51.857 --> 24:54.042
- I try not to be. 
- And how can there be no refrigerator?

24:54.284 --> 24:56.628
- There's no refrigerator? 
- I just assumed there'd be one!

24:56.736 --> 24:58.692
Great, so it's back to the Middle Ages for us.

24:58.856 --> 25:02.137
- Let's start storing meat in stocks of salt. 
- Is that someone looking in?

25:03.730 --> 25:05.661
- What's that? 
- It's a night light.

25:05.793 --> 25:08.819
Dude, when the Sex Pistols roomed together, no way did they have a night light.

25:08.998 --> 25:11.005
- You don't know that. 
- I read Johnny Rotten's book.

25:11.087 --> 25:14.210
- There's no mention of a night light. 
- Towels! I don't have towels.

25:14.339 --> 25:16.228
I've got this. This is not gonna work.

25:16.372 --> 25:19.576
Hey, when you said you had a bed for me, you didn't say it would be bunk beds.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.670
But they're cool. The bottom one's like a fort.

25:21.779 --> 25:23.883
- We're not playing fort. 
- We've got to start a list.

25:24.149 --> 25:26.244
Anyone have paper or a pen or money?

25:27.284 --> 25:32.377
Dude, look, this is my side of the shelf. Your stuff's encroaching.

25:32.505 --> 25:33.380
It's not encroaching.

25:33.544 --> 25:36.653
Bender and Leela are on my side. Put them back on your side.

25:36.790 --> 25:40.452
That's not Bender. That's Nibbler. Bender's a robot.

25:40.711 --> 25:42.530
Are you remotely aware that you're not twelve?

25:42.652 --> 25:45.111
- They're on my side! 
- They're on my side, dude. Move them.

25:45.202 --> 25:48.792
Guys, stop! Look down. There's a whole empty shelf for you to use,

25:48.889 --> 25:51.162
- so you can stop bickering. 
- But we put that aside for you.

25:51.398 --> 25:54.373
- What? 
- For your CDs and stuff. You need a shelf, Lane.

25:58.444 --> 25:59.963
Jeez. You smeared my glasses.

26:01.050 --> 26:03.665
This is gonna work, one step at a time.

26:03.947 --> 26:06.374
Listen, we set aside a shelf for you in the john, too.

26:06.436 --> 26:07.470
You don't need to hug us for that.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.711
- Mom, where the fire? 
- We have a lot to get through.

26:16.798 --> 26:19.287
- Mrs. Gilmore, did I know you were coming? 
- Not unless you're clairvoyant.

26:19.373 --> 26:21.484
- What are we looking for today? 
- What are we not looking for?

26:21.576 --> 26:23.578
This is my daughter, Lorelai, and my granddaughter, Rory.

26:23.670 --> 26:24.688
- Nice to meet you. 
- Same here.

26:24.812 --> 26:26.363
What's new? I want a full report.

26:26.468 --> 26:30.095
We have a china set that just arrived still in its crate that screams "Emily Gilmore."

26:30.239 --> 26:33.704
- Hand-painted? 
- Designed in 1870 for the Shah of Persia -- the finest.

26:33.788 --> 26:36.178
- Would you like to see it? 
- No need. Give me a set of twelve.

26:36.265 --> 26:38.375
Plus soup tureens, sauce boats, the works. What else?

26:38.442 --> 26:40.473
- Doreen. 
- That's gorgeous.

26:40.571 --> 26:42.274
From Giorgio Baldi's studio in Venice.

26:42.353 --> 26:44.155
- They only made eighteen. 
- Wrap them up.

26:44.251 --> 26:44.996
Right away.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.624
- Lorelai! 
- Your brake lights were out.

26:49.142 --> 26:52.249
You! You've got Richard Gilmore's sizes on file.

26:52.327 --> 26:55.450
Pull the latest Brionis in an assortment of colors and charge them to our account.

26:55.547 --> 26:56.965
- Yes, ma'am. 
- What are Brionis?

26:57.057 --> 26:58.712
Six months of my car payments, plus a car.

26:58.814 --> 27:02.131
Include accessories and three pairs of loafers -- Italian. They should feel like butter.

27:02.285 --> 27:04.379
- Make it four. Hell, make it six. 
- Yes, ma'am.

27:04.542 --> 27:05.460
And jewelry.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.906
Add an assortment of jewelry appropriate for a man with a moustache.

27:09.075 --> 27:11.557
What would that be? Bracelets, pinkie rings?

27:11.711 --> 27:14.541
And a moustache comb -- the most expensive one you've got.

27:14.634 --> 27:15.914
I will look. Excuse me.

27:16.570 --> 27:17.583
- Mom... 
- Keep up.

27:17.926 --> 27:19.370
Does Dad even want any of this stuff?

27:19.421 --> 27:22.105
He doesn't know what he wants, Lorelai, so I choose what he wants.

27:22.397 --> 27:23.548
- Excuse me. 
- Yes?

27:23.702 --> 27:24.394
I want this.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.681
I'm sorry, ma'am, that is just a display. It's not for sale.

27:26.794 --> 27:29.494
- Everything's for sale. 
- I will take care of it.

27:30.118 --> 27:31.684
Mom, Dad does not need another globe.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.516
Then Rory can have it. She goes to college. She can use a globe.

27:34.884 --> 27:36.585
It doesn't even have the right countries on it.

27:36.748 --> 27:37.829
- C'mon. 
- Or California.

27:38.182 --> 27:39.974
- Start picking! 
- Start picking what?

27:40.174 --> 27:42.535
- Everything, anything! 
- Mom, we don't have any money.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.213
- It's on your father. 
- But, Grandma...

27:44.501 --> 27:45.329
Some help, please.

27:46.216 --> 27:48.106
- You like hats? 
- Kind of.

27:48.366 --> 27:49.610
That one. Put it on her.

27:52.452 --> 27:56.226
I like it. These scarves all match, and of course you'll need gloves. We'll take them all.

27:57.071 --> 28:00.798
Hey, see those marbles rolling on the floor? They're Mom's. They spilled out of her head.

28:00.977 --> 28:04.183
- I do like the chapeau. 
- Do not get sucked in! This is craziness!

28:04.280 --> 28:05.882
-  It's just a hat. 
- It's a symbol.

28:05.964 --> 28:07.859
We don't know what it's symbolizing. Resist.

28:07.971 --> 28:08.678
Lorelai!

28:11.135 --> 28:12.850
- You need a watch. 
- I don't wear a watch.

28:12.957 --> 28:13.971
- Do you have a watch? 
- No.

28:14.074 --> 28:14.986
Then you need a watch.

28:15.241 --> 28:17.146
These don't have diamonds. Which ones have diamonds?

28:17.274 --> 28:19.317
- Next display. 
- Mom, I'm not buying a diamond watch.

28:19.429 --> 28:21.822
- You just have to take it. 
- I'm not taking it.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.285
I'm buying you a damn watch!

28:24.099 --> 28:25.160
That one. Wrap it up.

28:27.248 --> 28:28.969
Can I return the damn watch if I don't want it?

28:29.076 --> 28:30.105
- Yes, ma'am. 
- Thank you.

28:35.834 --> 28:37.304
- Are you keeping track? 
- I lost count.

28:37.407 --> 28:39.106
She bought me four cocktail dresses, two evening gowns,

28:39.183 --> 28:40.770
and if I'm not mistaken, eight maids a-milking.

28:40.857 --> 28:43.622
By the way, she bought you a wedding dress when you weren't looking. Vera Wang.

28:43.721 --> 28:44.747
Why didn't you stop her?

28:44.877 --> 28:46.812
Well how do you stop a top from spinning around?

28:46.877 --> 28:47.990
This is too much.

28:48.332 --> 28:50.898
- Girls, come on. Keep up. 
- Mom.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.151
- Stop dawdling and start picking some shoes. 
- Mom...

28:53.221 --> 28:54.968
These Manolo Blahniks would look great on you.

28:56.207 --> 28:58.855
- Oh, me wants them, my precious. 
- You told me to resist.

28:59.013 --> 29:00.780
Yeah, but that's before I saw these.

29:00.862 --> 29:02.382
These are works of art. They should be in the Louvre.

29:02.485 --> 29:05.536
Mrs Gilmore, I'm sorry. We only four of the Venetian apples in.

29:05.612 --> 29:07.327
If you want the rest, we can have them shipped.

29:07.441 --> 29:10.006
Well, give me the four today and ship the rest overnight whatever the cost.

29:10.082 --> 29:10.763
Yes, ma'am.

29:10.926 --> 29:13.513
- Mom, a quick word. 
- Where are your shoes?

29:13.626 --> 29:16.074
Wait. What is the rush on the funny glass apples?

29:16.195 --> 29:18.229
They're not funny, and I want them. That's the rush.

29:18.346 --> 29:20.246
Yes, but you've already put quite a dent in your credit card

29:20.323 --> 29:22.320
for things you don't seem to need.

29:22.438 --> 29:23.957
- So? 
- So it's crazy.

29:24.055 --> 29:26.310
Crazy? You think this is crazy?

29:26.426 --> 29:27.824
- Okay, Mom... 
- This isn't crazy!

29:27.923 --> 29:29.857
- I didn't mean to... 
- That stupid moustache is crazy!

29:29.944 --> 29:33.072
That's what's crazy! Your father's job is crazy! That's what's crazy!

29:33.185 --> 29:36.384
He was supposed to be slowing down, and now he's club-hopping with Jason

29:36.476 --> 29:39.677
and hanging out with Moby and having secret lunches with women and lying about it!

29:39.763 --> 29:41.499
- Mom, Calm down. 
- Why should I calm down?

29:41.606 --> 29:43.342
Are you on his side? Do you like that moustache?

29:43.464 --> 29:44.741
I'm not taking sides.

29:44.852 --> 29:47.463
I should go to bars! I should hang out with Moby! He'd hate that.

29:47.572 --> 29:50.403
Mom, I'm just suggesting that you slow down on the shopping.

29:50.491 --> 29:53.188
- This doesn't have to be a whole big thing. 
- Why do I need to slow down?

29:53.297 --> 29:56.454
This is what I do, according to Richard. And he's not slowing down.

29:56.558 --> 30:00.158
He's got a whole new life. He's got Pennilyn Lott, he's got Digger, he's got a moustache!

30:00.285 --> 30:02.057
He's got all that and what do I have?

30:02.144 --> 30:04.069
Maybe I should get a job so I can have my own life.

30:04.191 --> 30:07.734
I could sell shoes here just as well Eduardo. I should get an application.

30:07.821 --> 30:09.250
Get me an application! Go, go!

30:10.028 --> 30:12.614
- Mom... 
- I hate that moustache, and he refuses to shave it!

30:12.690 --> 30:14.918
- Mom, let's take a break. 
- I don't want to take a break!

30:15.004 --> 30:16.910
Well, we do, and my feet are killing me.

30:17.001 --> 30:18.732
- Well, then get some new shoes! 
- Come on.

30:24.872 --> 30:25.885
Where are we going?

30:26.125 --> 30:27.237
Right around the corner here.

30:27.447 --> 30:28.798
We really should have taken our bags.

30:28.967 --> 30:29.996
They said they'd hold them.

30:30.211 --> 30:32.111
I'm totally turned around. Where are we?

30:32.218 --> 30:33.339
You'll smell in a second.

30:35.777 --> 30:36.816
What is this?

30:37.323 --> 30:39.831
- It's the food court. 
- How long has this been here?

30:39.953 --> 30:41.414
You've never been to the food court, Mom?

30:42.167 --> 30:45.275
- Where do you eat when you shop? 
- I leave and go to a restaurant.

30:45.602 --> 30:49.273
With this Valhalla of international cuisine so close?

30:50.154 --> 30:52.566
- But it's cafeteria-style. 
- That's the fun.

30:52.877 --> 30:54.291
Here. Best table in the house.

30:55.202 --> 30:56.179
It's plastic.

30:56.559 --> 30:59.298
Plastic is a vital part of our bright tomorrow.

30:59.396 --> 31:01.715
- Soon we'll all be living in plastic houses. 
- On the moon.

31:01.941 --> 31:04.014
- What are you talking about? 
- We're pulling your leg, Grandma.

31:04.146 --> 31:05.926
- Well don't do that. 
- So what are you in the mood for?

31:06.098 --> 31:08.494
- I don't know. 
- I want Mexican.

31:08.683 --> 31:10.474
I kind of feel like Moroccan and Chinese.

31:10.593 --> 31:12.159
- So smorgasbord. 
- Yeah. Come on.

31:12.268 --> 31:13.465
Wait. Here.

31:13.629 --> 31:16.645
Oh, no, Mom. Moe's Moroccan Palace does not take credit cards.

31:16.972 --> 31:18.237
- You're kidding. 
- It's on us.

31:19.292 --> 31:21.227
Keep an eye on her. Make sure she doesn't wander off.

31:28.242 --> 31:30.649
The ad cannot run with the color composition the way it is.

31:30.745 --> 31:32.414
The drawing of the inn looks purple.

31:33.284 --> 31:36.312
Yes, I know, but I'm not paying for it looking like that.

31:36.418 --> 31:37.632
I do understand. It looks awful.

31:38.512 --> 31:41.969
Fine. Have him call me. I would love to sort it out. Okay?

31:42.393 --> 31:44.293
Thank you. Bye. Sorry.

31:44.969 --> 31:47.411
- What is all this? 
- It's lunch. Thanks, Lou.

31:48.097 --> 31:49.747
I got a little something from everywhere.

31:50.135 --> 31:51.364
I wouldn't know where to begin.

31:52.030 --> 31:54.401
Well, start at the top and stop when you hit table.

31:55.465 --> 31:58.384
I had no idea so many different kinds of foods came on sticks.

31:58.824 --> 32:00.693
Well, some come on sticks,

32:00.991 --> 32:03.288
like the hot dogs and the fried cheese dipped in batter,

32:03.329 --> 32:05.464
- but others are technically kabobs. 
- What's in the cups?

32:05.639 --> 32:09.872
Well, you got your soda, your iced tea, root beer, lemonade.

32:10.007 --> 32:12.125
- I'll try this. 
- Ah, Orange Julius.

32:12.264 --> 32:12.919
A classic.

32:14.461 --> 32:16.177
Oh, my. That's very good.

32:16.749 --> 32:19.985
Your father and I know a man who owns a couple dozen of these stands

32:20.180 --> 32:23.743
as part of his holdings. Now I can sincerely tell him I like his product.

32:23.861 --> 32:25.853
- Excellent. 
- Oh, we forgot napkins.

32:25.981 --> 32:27.522
Get some more little pepper thingies, please.

32:28.567 --> 32:32.135
So dig in, Mom. You've got sweet-and-sour pork and pizza

32:32.325 --> 32:36.099
and some wrapped thingy. I already forgot what it is, but it's probably not healthy.

32:36.592 --> 32:40.307
Oh, and there's ice cream, too. We can get some after if you want.

32:40.563 --> 32:41.193
All right.

32:44.603 --> 32:46.353
So how loud was I back there?

32:48.252 --> 32:50.601
Well, you were heard.

32:51.730 --> 32:55.022
If I had seen somebody act that way in a store, I would have called security.

32:55.795 --> 32:59.841
It's really okay, Mom. It wasn't that loud. It's totally forgotten.

33:01.415 --> 33:04.259
Oh! Do not disturb. I'm eating.

33:05.661 --> 33:07.310
What was that phone call you got before,

33:07.693 --> 33:09.154
when you were coming over with the trays?

33:09.323 --> 33:12.588
Oh, it's this ad we're doing for the inn. The drawing of the inn came out purple,

33:12.703 --> 33:15.010
like eggplant, like Prince chose the color. It was bad.

33:15.359 --> 33:17.585
- Sounds awful. 
- It was their screw-up.

33:17.725 --> 33:20.351
Just one of the many joyous things I get to deal with on a daily basis.

33:20.555 --> 33:23.167
- You were very forceful. 
- Was I?

33:23.612 --> 33:25.625
Very in command. I like how you handled it.

33:26.075 --> 33:28.952
- Well, I learned from the best. 
- From whom?

33:30.730 --> 33:34.666
From the lady eating her hamburger with a knife and fork. That's whom.

33:34.857 --> 33:38.774
Oh, please. I order maids and salespeople around. That's different.

33:40.048 --> 33:41.286
I've never done anything.

33:42.818 --> 33:45.194
Mom, come on. That's not true.

33:45.500 --> 33:50.129
Richard's right. I buy things. Things I don't even want. It's all I have.

33:50.585 --> 33:55.921
No, Mom, you have friends and family who love being with you.

33:56.180 --> 33:59.637
And you have a house you love. You have a whole life.

33:59.801 --> 34:03.365
You could have a dog if you want. There's a swell pet store here.

34:04.255 --> 34:07.021
You're losing perspective, Mom. You're not seeing clearly.

34:07.224 --> 34:09.735
If he would just shave that moustache.

34:09.806 --> 34:11.690
And that's all it would take? Shaving his moustache?

34:12.478 --> 34:14.281
Mom, you need to talk to him.

34:15.166 --> 34:18.937
- He's always so distracted. 
- No. Make him talk. You need it.

34:19.150 --> 34:23.158
And make it a real talk without bickering, without snipping, without mentioning Moby.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.659
Really clear the air.

34:25.339 --> 34:28.735
I got pepper, I got napkins, I got Lou's phone number. He asked me to give it to you.

34:28.918 --> 34:31.166
- Oh, I'm privileged. 
- What'd I miss?

34:31.598 --> 34:33.399
I was just admiring your mother's life.

34:33.703 --> 34:34.715
Oh, I do that daily.

34:45.297 --> 34:47.139
Oh, God! Oh, God!

34:53.130 --> 34:54.038
- Hey, Joe. 
- Hey, Luke.

34:54.125 --> 34:57.452
- Can I get twenty singles off you? 
- Sure. It's gonna cost you $25.

34:58.814 --> 35:01.538
- It's change humor. 
- I know. You do it every time.

35:01.656 --> 35:02.706
-  I'll get them for you. 
- Thanks.

35:06.449 --> 35:07.237
- Hey, Luke. 
- Hi, Dean.

35:07.401 --> 35:08.250
Wait. Hold on.

35:11.467 --> 35:12.658
No, you did good.

35:13.733 --> 35:16.377
- Short of your record, though, Dean. 
- Yeah, I'll get there.

35:16.899 --> 35:18.855
He's the reigning champ of every game in here.

35:18.931 --> 35:22.716
I'm not here that much. I just come after dinner sometimes, y'know.

35:22.930 --> 35:26.452
Lindsay and her mom kind of like me out of the way when they're cleaning up.

35:26.571 --> 35:29.817
- They kick you out, huh? 
- I just slip out. They don't really notice.

35:29.981 --> 35:33.436
- So how's married life treating you? 
- Good. Real good. Lindsay's great.

35:33.580 --> 35:36.150
- Yeah, she seems great. 
- And her parents are fantastic.

35:36.269 --> 35:38.608
- I mean, they help out so much. 
- Like with the cleaning up.

35:38.700 --> 35:42.959
Her dad's over all the time, fixing things. Lindsay's got this list for him to do.

35:43.175 --> 35:45.564
- Great. 
- They're the most unselfish people I know.

35:45.883 --> 35:48.631
I've seen them around. The dad works for the county, doesn't he?

35:48.732 --> 35:53.817
- He's a surveyor or something? 
- Yeah. Oh. He used to. But I think now he...

35:55.869 --> 35:59.958
I think he's... actually, he manages an apartment,

36:00.077 --> 36:03.916
so he oversees the guys, and he's not really...

36:04.628 --> 36:07.603
- Not surveying much. 
- Yeah, he's not in the field much.

36:07.735 --> 36:09.753
Okay, well, I'll let you get back to your game.

36:10.399 --> 36:12.559
Yeah. Hey, see you later, man.

36:13.301 --> 36:14.070
Thanks.

36:23.045 --> 36:24.673
- What are you doing? 
- Taking inventory.

36:24.776 --> 36:25.820
We should return it all.

36:26.009 --> 36:28.841
Mom's gonna expect to see us with something she bought us.

36:28.943 --> 36:31.370
- We have to keep something. 
- Seven hundred dollar yoga bag?

36:31.534 --> 36:33.239
- Get out of here. 
- Oh, yes, my friend,

36:33.357 --> 36:35.707
rich people like their sweaty mats to have expensive homes.

36:35.820 --> 36:38.450
- We could each keep a little clutch purse. 
- What's that tubey one for?

36:38.650 --> 36:40.161
- Lifesavers. 
- The candy?

36:40.299 --> 36:41.421
- Yep. 
- Get out of here.

36:41.569 --> 36:43.642
- Turquoise leather jacket? 
- Pass.

36:44.140 --> 36:46.792
- Hair clips with diamond Betty Boops? 
- Pass.

36:47.282 --> 36:49.951
- Tropical-print embroidered bikini? 
- Not me.

36:50.237 --> 36:51.916
- Luke? 
- This is sick.

36:52.332 --> 36:53.197
This I'll take.

36:53.355 --> 36:55.260
- Oh, no. I have dibs on that. 
- In your mind.

36:55.348 --> 36:57.278
- I said it in the store. 
- Yeah and I said it, too.

36:57.364 --> 36:59.376
And I clutched it. It still has my clutch marks.

36:59.443 --> 37:01.467
You do realize that the one thing we're fighting over is the free tote bag

37:01.539 --> 37:03.268
- that came with our purchase. 
- It's a nice totebag

37:03.376 --> 37:06.555
-  I'm upset just watching this. 
- This is your window on a whole other world, Luke.

37:06.667 --> 37:08.916
The world of worthless rich-people stuff.

37:09.111 --> 37:12.489
People of means see what they want and simply take it, regardless of others.

37:12.822 --> 37:14.645
- You pour your own coffee? 
- Oh, yeah.

37:14.721 --> 37:16.923
- You're not supposed to do that. 
- Oh yeah, sorry, I won't do it again.

37:27.004 --> 37:29.002
- Does anyone know who this is? 
- No.

37:29.201 --> 37:30.548
Yeah, it's Snuggles.

37:30.870 --> 37:33.277
- You know Snuggles? 
- It's not Snuggles.

37:33.385 --> 37:36.748
It's the dog that looks like Snuggles. Snuggles' owner picked him up.

37:36.856 --> 37:38.837
No one picked this guy up and he has no tag.

37:38.935 --> 37:41.603
- You have a dog left over. 
- You knew Snuggles by name?

37:41.689 --> 37:43.809
I don't have time for chitchat here, people!

37:43.892 --> 37:45.544
I have no idea whose dog it is.

37:45.669 --> 37:46.898
- Me either. 
- Sorry.

37:47.039 --> 37:48.146
I don't even know his name.

37:48.483 --> 37:51.382
I was using random sounds, trying to see if he'd respond.

37:51.765 --> 37:54.080
Paku. Gnocchi.

37:54.751 --> 37:57.393
Nini. Bleeblo.

37:58.607 --> 38:00.132
- Nothing. 
- Sorry.

38:00.521 --> 38:02.023
I've got to put up more flyers.

38:02.410 --> 38:05.974
Sunna. Lipdoo. Funo...

38:06.261 --> 38:11.626
- Thank God. I'm so tired. 
- Me too, and I have to get back to Yale.

38:11.740 --> 38:13.505
- I had a great time today. 
- So did I.

38:13.644 --> 38:16.782
Okay, good. We should make this a regular part of our weekly schedule?

38:16.925 --> 38:18.468
- Sounds good. 
- So next Tuesday?

38:18.820 --> 38:21.744
Tuesday's good. Oh, shoot. I can't. Wednesday?

38:22.197 --> 38:24.099
Sure. I'll have to cancel plans with Jason.

38:24.222 --> 38:25.871
Don't cancel plans with Jason.

38:26.153 --> 38:28.390
Dumb me, I've got class that night anyway.

38:28.532 --> 38:29.624
All right. Skip ahead a week.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.985
I hate that we have to schedule time like this.

38:32.102 --> 38:34.176
- But if we don't, we don't see each other, right? 
- Right.

38:34.263 --> 38:36.745
- So what about the weekend? 
- I'll be at Friday night dinner at Grandma's.

38:36.884 --> 38:39.121
Great. I won't. Not this one. Darn.

38:41.876 --> 38:43.970
- Hey, you want pie? 
- Yeah.

38:44.113 --> 38:47.185
- 'Cause I'm getting my second wind. 
- Me too. Let's have pie.

38:47.528 --> 38:50.186
Hey, Luke, we're having pie.

38:50.443 --> 38:52.403
Okay, just wait for me to serve it.

38:55.007 --> 38:57.123
Should we be worried about Grandma?

38:57.624 --> 38:59.852
Oh, I think she'll be okay.

39:02.690 --> 39:05.453
Was anything resolved? Are she and Grandpa gonna be all right?

39:05.582 --> 39:08.663
Don't worry about it. They're a team. They'll be okay.

39:08.864 --> 39:11.193
- Good. I like them. 
- I know.

39:21.869 --> 39:22.904
Thanks.

39:32.780 --> 39:34.428
Did you deal with that business with the gardeners?

39:35.396 --> 39:36.122
Not yet.

39:39.951 --> 39:42.456
We need to resolve that. Those vines are out of control.

39:43.111 --> 39:43.987
I'll see to it.

39:46.019 --> 39:48.001
Be nice to have that finished by the time I get back.

39:49.113 --> 39:50.366
Get back? From where?

39:50.485 --> 39:52.369
Jason and I are meeting some clients in Manhattan.

39:52.517 --> 39:55.067
It's some new place downtown -- Tribeca, I think.

39:55.891 --> 39:57.175
It's really an up-and-coming area.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.342
I'll probably stay in the city, take the train in the morning.

40:02.614 --> 40:03.531
Is that all right with you?

40:04.370 --> 40:05.123
That's fine.

40:09.589 --> 40:10.637
What do you think of these?

40:11.962 --> 40:12.920
The apples.

40:15.655 --> 40:17.345
I've always liked those.
