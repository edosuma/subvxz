01:31.995 --> 01:36.565
Stokes' theorem is the remarkable statement

01:36.599 --> 01:40.436
that the line integral of F along C

01:40.470 --> 01:42.871
is equal to the flux integral

01:42.906 --> 01:46.108
of the curl of F through the surface S,

01:46.142 --> 01:49.378
which we know is the surface integral

01:49.412 --> 01:54.516
of the normal component of
the curl along the surface S.

01:57.754 --> 01:59.488
Up top! Up top!

01:59.522 --> 02:00.656
Layup!

02:01.758 --> 02:02.791
Pass!

02:02.826 --> 02:04.226
Yo, Ref!

02:04.260 --> 02:06.195
Here I go, here I go!

02:07.263 --> 02:08.564
Got the shot.

02:08.598 --> 02:10.199
Whoo!

02:13.970 --> 02:15.371
I am not doing this.

02:15.438 --> 02:17.373
All right, but it's definitely
gonna be on the test,

02:17.407 --> 02:19.575
so you should look at it at least once.

02:19.609 --> 02:22.211
Nah, man, fuck it. 'Cause I gotta go.

02:22.245 --> 02:25.114
All right, you wanna take the book
home? Look at it over the weekend?

02:25.148 --> 02:26.548
Call me if you get stuck or whatever.

02:26.583 --> 02:27.716
On a weekend?

02:27.751 --> 02:29.618
You gotta be kidding me.

02:29.652 --> 02:31.954
It's just, uh, it's just one chapter.

02:31.988 --> 02:33.122
It's not that hard.

02:33.156 --> 02:35.424
The guy's trying to help
you, man, just take the book.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.159
I'm not taking the book.

02:37.193 --> 02:38.494
You almost done, man?

02:38.528 --> 02:39.895
Uh, yeah, almost.

02:39.929 --> 02:40.996
Yeah.

02:41.031 --> 02:44.500
Hey, man, you wanna party with us tonight?

02:44.534 --> 02:46.301
We're going to my
ex-fiancee's in the city.

02:46.336 --> 02:48.303
Gonna be mad females.

02:48.338 --> 02:50.205
55 Stanton Street.

02:51.274 --> 02:52.574
- My tutor?
- Shut up.

02:52.609 --> 02:54.610
He's the only reason
you're still on the team.

02:54.644 --> 02:57.479
Did he say "ex-fiancee"?

02:59.449 --> 03:01.116
That's game.

03:16.785 --> 03:20.790
_

03:25.655 --> 03:27.976
_

03:28.011 --> 03:29.878
Shouldn't you be helping
the customers, Auntie?

03:31.781 --> 03:34.283
- Hi, Nasir, <i>beta.</i>
- <i>Salaam alaikum,</i> Auntie.

03:35.218 --> 03:36.618
- <i>Salaam alaikum.</i>
- Hi, <i>beta.</i>

03:36.653 --> 03:37.619
Where's your father?

03:37.654 --> 03:38.754
He's outside. You ready?

03:38.788 --> 03:39.655
Yeah. Where's Hasu?

03:39.689 --> 03:41.223
Yeah, both outside. He's double-parked.

03:41.257 --> 03:43.092
- Okay, okay. Almost done. Almost done.
- _

03:43.126 --> 03:45.327
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:45.930 --> 03:49.230
_

03:49.265 --> 03:51.133
That's fine.

03:54.437 --> 03:56.138
Stoudemire has got to stay on the bench.

03:56.172 --> 03:58.073
He can't sit on the bench, man.

03:58.108 --> 04:00.109
You can't build a team around both of them.

04:00.143 --> 04:02.111
You gotta just build a team around Melo.

04:02.145 --> 04:04.346
- He's not the same...
- No one else is gonna put up those points.

04:04.380 --> 04:05.547
Yeah, but Melo will.

04:05.582 --> 04:08.317
Okay, but he's not a beast in
the paint like Stoudemire is.

04:08.351 --> 04:10.419
So, what are you doing
tonight, <i>baba?</i>

04:10.453 --> 04:13.122
Um, I'm meeting... I got a thing to go to.

04:13.156 --> 04:14.256
- Thing?
- Yeah.

04:14.290 --> 04:15.491
Like a team party downtown.

04:15.558 --> 04:17.692
- Team party? What team?
- Mm-hmm.

04:17.726 --> 04:18.927
The Kings.

04:18.962 --> 04:20.629
- The Kings?
- Yeah.

04:23.766 --> 04:26.335
I don't like you going
to something like that.

04:26.369 --> 04:27.603
Like what?

04:27.637 --> 04:29.037
A party like that.

04:29.072 --> 04:30.806
- Downtown.
- Like... like black?

04:30.840 --> 04:33.442
- Hmm?
- Like a black party?

04:33.476 --> 04:34.810
I didn't say that.

04:36.346 --> 04:38.247
Hi, my name's Naz, nice to meet you.

04:38.281 --> 04:39.915
Nice to meet you, my name's Naz.

04:39.949 --> 04:41.049
I'm on the...

04:41.084 --> 04:42.217
I'm kind of on the team.

04:42.252 --> 04:44.353
I'm on the tu... I'm on the
coaching side of the team.

04:46.923 --> 04:48.824
Yo, Amir, where are you, man?

04:51.794 --> 04:53.295
You're kidding me.

04:53.329 --> 04:54.796
Nah, nah, nah, listen...

04:54.831 --> 04:56.398
Listen, just borrow your brother's car.

04:56.432 --> 04:58.400
Just borrow it.

04:58.434 --> 05:00.002
Why not?

05:00.036 --> 05:01.170
He...

05:02.338 --> 05:04.806
Nah, man, listen, there's
not gonna be other parties.

05:04.841 --> 05:05.941
Not like this one, man.

05:05.975 --> 05:08.143
You have any idea the kind
of girls are gonna be there?

05:08.178 --> 05:09.978
We are invited. We...

05:10.013 --> 05:12.381
Please, man.

05:12.415 --> 05:14.583
You could have told me an hour ago.

05:16.886 --> 05:19.354
All right, all right.

05:19.389 --> 05:20.956
All right, see you tomorrow, man.

05:20.990 --> 05:22.157
You're a punk.

05:22.192 --> 05:23.592
All right, bye.

06:27.971 --> 06:32.727
_

07:14.203 --> 07:16.938
Dude, dude, dude, hey,
where's Stanton Street?

07:19.575 --> 07:21.243
Up?

07:25.181 --> 07:27.416
I'm off-duty.

07:35.558 --> 07:39.494
Then turn on your off-duty light, asshole!

07:39.529 --> 07:41.029
Oh, shit.

07:44.701 --> 07:45.767
Oh, fuck.

08:08.658 --> 08:10.726
23rd and 10th, please.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.627
I'm sorry, I can't take you.

08:12.662 --> 08:14.096
- What?
- I can't...

08:14.130 --> 08:15.797
I can't take you. You're
gonna have to get out.

08:15.832 --> 08:17.299
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.234
Yo, what are you talking about, man?

08:19.268 --> 08:20.402
I can't take you, man.

08:20.436 --> 08:21.803
- What do you mean, you can't take us?
- It's not my cab.

08:21.838 --> 08:24.639
- What do you mean, it's not your cab?
- I'm filling in. I'm off...

08:24.674 --> 08:26.975
- We're not getting out of this cab.
- Why aren't we moving?

08:27.009 --> 08:29.945
Sorry?

08:33.249 --> 08:35.082
What's up there, Captain Bubba?

08:35.118 --> 08:37.018
I'm off-duty, but these
guys won't get out.

08:37.053 --> 08:38.053
So turn on your light.

08:38.087 --> 08:39.554
I know, there's a problem with it.

08:40.523 --> 08:41.722
Back up.

08:44.727 --> 08:46.795
All right, gents, subway time.

08:46.829 --> 08:47.863
What?

08:47.897 --> 08:51.466
Either subway time, or
overtime. I could use the money.

08:51.501 --> 08:53.902
- Let's go.
- What? Where are we going?

08:53.936 --> 08:55.470
Thank you.

08:55.505 --> 08:56.872
Fuck you!

08:59.442 --> 09:00.575
Uh, officer,

09:00.610 --> 09:02.177
do you know where
Stanton Street is, please?

09:02.211 --> 09:05.046
You're driving a cab downtown and you
don't know where Stanton Street is?

09:05.081 --> 09:06.648
It's my first week.

09:06.682 --> 09:09.050
Down Second, Houston going east,

09:09.085 --> 09:10.285
make a right wherever you can.

09:10.319 --> 09:11.720
All right. Thank you.

09:19.629 --> 09:21.196
Yo, guys, I'm off-duty!

09:21.230 --> 09:23.265
What?

09:27.737 --> 09:30.305
Um, I'm supposed to be off-duty.

09:31.407 --> 09:33.708
You are? Your light isn't on.

09:33.743 --> 09:36.711
Yeah, I know, it's, uh...

09:36.746 --> 09:39.414
See, I don't know where the light is

09:39.449 --> 09:41.216
'cause it's not my cab.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.852
Are you gonna make me get out?

09:47.657 --> 09:49.524
Where do you wanna go?

09:49.559 --> 09:52.194
What do you mean?

09:52.228 --> 09:56.364
Well, you got in my cab, so, like,
where do you want me to take you?

09:57.834 --> 09:59.734
The beach.

09:59.769 --> 10:01.203
The beach?

10:01.237 --> 10:02.671
Yeah, the beach.

10:04.140 --> 10:05.740
Um...

10:05.775 --> 10:08.610
we're in Manhattan, so...

10:08.644 --> 10:10.479
uh, I could do a river?

10:10.513 --> 10:12.447
A river would be fine.

10:12.482 --> 10:14.850
Not down here, though. Go uptown.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.221
Okay.

10:27.997 --> 10:29.831
I really would like to get going.

10:29.866 --> 10:30.765
Yeah.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.167
Sorry.

10:47.149 --> 10:49.684
Um, how far?

10:49.719 --> 10:51.953
What?

10:51.988 --> 10:53.989
How far uptown?

10:56.092 --> 10:57.659
Far.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.781
I'm thirsty.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.914
These two, please.

11:58.588 --> 12:01.022
And, uh, let me use the
restroom real quick, please?

12:03.559 --> 12:04.826
Thanks.

12:15.805 --> 12:18.440
You wanna be my next passenger?

12:25.915 --> 12:27.349
All right, thanks, man.

12:27.383 --> 12:30.151
Uh, you can keep that. Thanks.

13:03.185 --> 13:04.619
What's up with him?

13:06.422 --> 13:08.056
Who cares?

13:35.551 --> 13:38.019
So, whose is it?

13:38.054 --> 13:39.387
What?

13:39.422 --> 13:40.588
The cab.

13:40.623 --> 13:42.424
You said it wasn't yours when I got in.

13:44.293 --> 13:46.795
I didn't think you heard anything I said.

13:46.829 --> 13:49.698
I don't miss much.

13:49.732 --> 13:51.900
Uh, it's my dad's.

13:53.536 --> 13:55.603
Actually, it's like, one-third my dad's.

13:55.638 --> 13:57.839
He owns it with, like, two other guys.

13:57.873 --> 14:00.909
And you just use it whenever?

14:00.943 --> 14:03.044
Yeah.

14:03.079 --> 14:04.679
Actually, no.

14:04.714 --> 14:06.314
Just tonight.

14:06.348 --> 14:09.417
Why tonight?

14:09.452 --> 14:13.021
There's, like, this party
I didn't want to miss.

14:13.055 --> 14:15.590
Was.

14:15.624 --> 14:17.258
- Is.
- Now.

14:17.293 --> 14:18.226
Yeah.

14:18.260 --> 14:19.661
So, you're missing it.

14:19.695 --> 14:20.962
Yeah.

14:22.031 --> 14:24.532
Because of me.

14:54.630 --> 14:56.331
So, you close to him?

14:56.365 --> 14:57.732
Who, my dad?

14:59.034 --> 15:00.835
Yeah. Pretty much.

15:00.870 --> 15:01.936
He's a good dad?

15:01.971 --> 15:04.405
Yeah.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.174
Yeah, yours?

15:06.208 --> 15:07.809
He was okay.

15:07.843 --> 15:10.011
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:12.615 --> 15:16.050
Friday night. Full moon. The river.

15:16.085 --> 15:18.520
This is pretty wonderful.

15:18.554 --> 15:20.455
Yeah, I feel pretty good.

15:20.489 --> 15:22.924
You don't always?

15:22.958 --> 15:25.627
No, it's just...

15:25.661 --> 15:27.896
Like, a lot of time you
just do what you gotta do,

15:27.930 --> 15:32.200
or you do what everybody
wants you to do, but...

15:32.234 --> 15:33.401
You know?

15:33.435 --> 15:36.437
I don't, actually.

15:41.110 --> 15:44.179
Tonight was different. Feels different.

15:44.213 --> 15:47.182
And you have no idea why.

15:47.216 --> 15:49.017
Heh.

15:56.025 --> 15:57.625
Open your hand.

16:04.834 --> 16:07.135
Uh, no, it's okay.

16:24.453 --> 16:27.956
Do you ever wish you could
just transport yourself?

16:27.990 --> 16:32.660
Something bad happens here,
and suddenly you're over there?

16:40.502 --> 16:43.037
I can't be alone tonight.

17:48.370 --> 17:49.404
You okay?

17:49.438 --> 17:50.738
Yeah.

17:51.907 --> 17:52.974
Yeah.

18:09.124 --> 18:10.158
Huh?

18:12.995 --> 18:14.395
This is nice.

18:14.430 --> 18:16.698
Yeah, it's okay.

18:16.732 --> 18:18.499
It's more than okay, this is nice.

18:18.534 --> 18:20.101
Okay.

18:21.270 --> 18:22.971
I'm just saying.

18:24.540 --> 18:28.042
Ah, look, Mustafa left his bombs
home, 'bout to get him some.

18:29.511 --> 18:30.979
What?

18:33.515 --> 18:34.515
What?

18:34.550 --> 18:36.551
What did you say?

18:37.586 --> 18:39.520
- Me?
- Yeah.

18:40.689 --> 18:44.092
I said, did you leave your
bombs at home, Mustafa?

18:44.126 --> 18:45.293
Give it a rest, okay?

18:45.327 --> 18:48.796
What, I was just talking to
him, I wasn't talking to you.

18:48.831 --> 18:52.200
What happened? You saw
Homeland Security or something?

18:56.105 --> 18:57.305
Funny guy.

18:57.339 --> 18:58.339
Come on.

18:58.374 --> 18:59.407
Anyway, look,

18:59.441 --> 19:01.175
I'm going to Shiranda's, man.

19:01.210 --> 19:02.977
I know that her cousin is there,

19:03.012 --> 19:04.879
And, uh, she got that fat ass.

19:04.913 --> 19:06.514
I know they got some weed over there, too.

19:24.033 --> 19:25.767
This is your place?

19:25.801 --> 19:27.869
Yeah.

19:34.476 --> 19:35.576
Uh-oh.

19:35.611 --> 19:36.744
What?

19:46.021 --> 19:47.555
No, it's fine.

19:50.459 --> 19:52.193
Actually, I'll just...

19:53.929 --> 19:54.962
It's fine now.

19:56.598 --> 20:01.035
Just cats... or dogs.

20:17.453 --> 20:19.220
Can I ask you something?

20:21.857 --> 20:23.191
What's your name?

20:23.225 --> 20:25.793
- I didn't tell you?
- No.

20:29.698 --> 20:31.766
You don't want to know mine?

20:33.469 --> 20:35.169
Does that happen to you a lot?

20:35.204 --> 20:37.205
What?

20:37.239 --> 20:39.140
Those guys out there.

20:40.943 --> 20:42.376
Now and then.

20:55.190 --> 20:56.858
Oh...

20:59.194 --> 21:01.662
Do you have a girlfriend?

21:01.697 --> 21:05.133
No. Do you?

21:07.436 --> 21:09.003
Would that turn you on?

21:17.946 --> 21:20.047
Watch this.

21:23.585 --> 21:25.153
Whoa.

21:28.490 --> 21:30.525
Wow.

21:30.559 --> 21:31.893
Now you.

21:31.927 --> 21:34.896
What? No.

21:37.633 --> 21:39.433
No, not even with that. I don't...

21:39.468 --> 21:41.469
Oh, come on, look, I did it.

21:41.503 --> 21:43.371
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

21:43.405 --> 21:45.573
- No. No way.
- Yes.

21:46.909 --> 21:49.076
Don't you do what everyone tells you to do?

21:51.213 --> 21:52.747
Isn't that what you said?

22:11.366 --> 22:12.500
Oh...

22:12.534 --> 22:14.802
- You did it.
- Whoa.

22:14.836 --> 22:16.170
Whoa.

22:17.539 --> 22:19.840
Am I really here?

22:29.084 --> 22:30.351
What is that?

22:32.287 --> 22:34.288
This is the party you missed.

23:08.423 --> 23:10.157
Now...

23:12.494 --> 23:13.561
What?

23:18.533 --> 23:20.601
That, I won't do.

23:20.636 --> 23:22.169
- Yes.
- That, I will not do.

23:22.204 --> 23:23.371
Yes.

23:23.405 --> 23:25.172
I can't.

23:27.342 --> 23:28.976
- No.
- Yes.

23:33.615 --> 23:34.949
Yes.

23:54.903 --> 23:56.771
Oh, sh...

26:55.116 --> 26:59.119
Hey, I think it's pretty late, so...

26:59.154 --> 27:00.521
I should probably get going.

27:00.555 --> 27:02.857
I gotta get home, so...

27:18.607 --> 27:19.974
Hey.

28:12.260 --> 28:13.894
Fuck!

28:31.479 --> 28:33.781
Aah!

29:46.888 --> 29:48.355
Oh...

31:10.305 --> 31:11.772
Roll your window down.

31:11.806 --> 31:12.740
Huh?

31:12.774 --> 31:15.709
Roll the window down.

31:15.744 --> 31:17.377
Roll it down.

31:20.014 --> 31:23.183
So, let me ask you, in your own
words, what does "no left turn" mean?

31:24.986 --> 31:26.220
Uh...

31:26.254 --> 31:27.755
I must have missed the sign, I...

31:27.789 --> 31:29.623
License, registration, and insurance.

31:35.530 --> 31:36.597
Come on.

31:36.631 --> 31:37.698
Give it to him.

31:37.732 --> 31:38.899
Over here.

31:44.305 --> 31:45.906
How much did you drink tonight?

31:45.940 --> 31:46.874
Huh?

31:46.908 --> 31:47.908
I don't drink.

31:47.942 --> 31:49.143
- No?
- Nothing, I don't drink.

31:49.177 --> 31:52.079
No? 'Cause I'm getting high
just conversating with you.

31:52.113 --> 31:53.680
Step out of the car.

31:56.651 --> 31:57.918
Out.

32:00.488 --> 32:01.755
And I got a song request.

32:01.790 --> 32:05.292
How 'bout you play me, maybe,
two bars of "Little Brown Jug."

32:07.262 --> 32:08.729
Do I have to?

32:08.763 --> 32:10.264
No, see that right there, that's a mistake.

32:10.298 --> 32:13.700
I'm gonna explain this to you since
I can see you're a little confused.

32:13.735 --> 32:15.702
- Yes, you may politely refuse...
- I can't...

32:15.737 --> 32:16.904
I'm not done.

32:16.938 --> 32:18.705
You refuse, it's a separate offense,

32:18.740 --> 32:20.841
which is an automatic
arrest. Is that what you want?

32:20.875 --> 32:22.676
- No.
- Hey, Cass.

32:25.613 --> 32:27.347
Put your hands on the car.

32:32.987 --> 32:35.489
Listen, nothing comes up on this guy.

32:35.523 --> 32:37.624
So why don't we just make
this reckless driving?

32:37.659 --> 32:39.126
- It's a lot less paperwork.
- Ugh.

32:39.160 --> 32:40.727
Come on, it's late.

32:40.762 --> 32:43.564
I don't want to do reckless driving.
I feel like he's done more than that.

32:43.598 --> 32:45.165
Come on. He's like a kid.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.434
Kids do stuff...

32:47.468 --> 32:49.369
65th and Central Park West.

32:49.404 --> 32:52.472
- Copy.
- Come on, what do you say?

32:52.507 --> 32:53.707
Yeah, copy?

32:53.741 --> 32:56.176
Please respond, 1031 at...

32:56.211 --> 32:57.644
You know what tonight is?

32:57.679 --> 32:59.980
- Huh?
- It's your lucky night.

33:00.014 --> 33:01.415
I can go?

33:01.449 --> 33:03.984
Did I say that?

33:04.018 --> 33:06.119
Break-in on 87th, we gotta go.

33:06.154 --> 33:08.589
What about Cheech and Chong, here,
what are we gonna do with him?

33:08.623 --> 33:10.490
I don't know. Cut him loose?

33:11.993 --> 33:13.560
Bring him with us?

33:13.595 --> 33:14.461
I can't.

33:14.495 --> 33:17.030
Is... Excuse me, is
somebody talking to you?

33:17.065 --> 33:18.265
- What...
- Shut up.

33:18.299 --> 33:20.767
I can't leave my father's cab here.

33:20.802 --> 33:22.135
What are you talking about?

33:22.170 --> 33:24.938
It's my dad's cab. I can't just
leave it. He needs it for work.

33:27.308 --> 33:30.711
Well, call him to come get
it. Else it's gonna get towed.

33:30.745 --> 33:31.845
- Let's go, in the back.
- Come on, let's go.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.181
- There's no car for him to come get the car.
- In the back.

33:34.215 --> 33:36.984
That's fine, that's fine. You'll
call him from the precinct.

33:37.018 --> 33:38.552
Hey, cuffs?

33:38.586 --> 33:40.153
No, I don't think so.

33:40.188 --> 33:41.822
He needs it for work,

33:41.856 --> 33:44.758
- and there's no way...
- Yeah, I know. You call him, when you get to the precinct,

33:44.792 --> 33:46.927
you tell him where it is, and
he'll come and get it. Let's go.

33:46.961 --> 33:48.729
Watch your head. There you go. Inside.

33:57.672 --> 33:59.339
What street is this?

34:20.161 --> 34:21.962
- You the gentleman that called?
- Yeah.

34:21.996 --> 34:23.463
Okay, so what's going on?

34:23.498 --> 34:25.532
So, I hear something, you know?

34:25.565 --> 34:26.934
A glass breaking.

34:26.967 --> 34:30.370
And then from my window,
I see an open door.

34:30.405 --> 34:32.906
I see this man go through the door,

34:32.940 --> 34:35.909
and then he comes back
out a few seconds later.

34:35.944 --> 34:38.612
Then I see him running down the street

34:38.646 --> 34:40.313
and get into a cab.

34:40.348 --> 34:42.014
Race?

34:42.050 --> 34:44.318
Could have been light-skinned black,

34:44.385 --> 34:46.386
uh, Latino, I really don't know.

34:46.420 --> 34:47.987
Not Caucasian, though?

34:48.022 --> 34:49.289
Could have been, sure, why not?

34:55.897 --> 34:57.097
Clothes?

34:57.130 --> 34:59.166
He wore clothes.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.201
I'm sorry. Uh, dark, maybe.

35:01.235 --> 35:02.936
Okay, maybe, and he took a cab.

35:02.971 --> 35:04.304
Yeah, a cab.

35:04.339 --> 35:07.174
Okay, sir, can you just wait
right here for us, please?

35:07.208 --> 35:08.475
- Here? Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Thank you.

35:08.509 --> 35:10.010
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

35:33.668 --> 35:35.569
- What do you got?
- We got a break-in.

35:35.603 --> 35:37.270
One eyewit, this gentleman here.

35:37.305 --> 35:39.239
Sees male, undetermined race,

35:39.273 --> 35:41.508
goes in, comes out, runs down the street,

35:41.542 --> 35:42.909
gets into a cab.

35:42.944 --> 35:44.244
Anyone inside?

35:44.278 --> 35:45.545
Waiting on you.

35:45.580 --> 35:46.680
Who's that in the car?

35:46.714 --> 35:49.916
No one. He was with us
when we got the call.

35:49.951 --> 35:53.320
He's not drunk, I can see that. He's
just driving like a fucking idiot.

35:53.354 --> 35:54.921
Fine. Let's go.

35:59.994 --> 36:02.996
Uh, sir, we're off-shift
like, two hours ago.

36:03.031 --> 36:04.698
Can you just take him in?

36:04.732 --> 36:06.833
Let's go inside.

36:06.868 --> 36:08.235
Flashlight.

36:10.638 --> 36:12.305
Hello?

36:12.340 --> 36:15.275
NYPD! Anybody home?

36:25.319 --> 36:26.686
Hello?

36:57.185 --> 36:59.619
Excuse me sir, take a step back.

36:59.654 --> 37:00.821
Sorry.

37:16.671 --> 37:19.239
Hey, Teddy? Yeah, it's Jerry.

37:19.273 --> 37:22.175
I'm at this break-in on 87th.

37:22.210 --> 37:24.177
Gonna need additional units.

37:24.212 --> 37:26.346
EMTs, Night Watch,

37:26.380 --> 37:28.148
CSU, and an ME.

37:29.550 --> 37:30.617
Are you puking?

37:30.651 --> 37:31.985
Tell me you're not puking.

37:32.019 --> 37:34.054
I'm gagging, I'm not puking.

37:34.088 --> 37:36.857
For fuck's sake, you gonna do that,
you can do it in the trunk of your car.

37:36.891 --> 37:38.492
This is a nice neighborhood.

37:38.559 --> 37:40.360
Is this guy still here?

37:40.394 --> 37:42.129
We're still here, where is he gonna go?

37:45.766 --> 37:48.702
Now I'm always respectful of the
fact that this is a great predator

37:50.371 --> 37:53.073
and certainly, if it wanted to,
could take me out very easily.

37:53.107 --> 37:54.374
Night Watch.

37:54.408 --> 37:56.409
Yeah, hey, it's Sergeant Klein at the 2-1.

37:56.444 --> 38:01.281
We got a suspicious DOA
at 144 West 87th Street.

38:01.315 --> 38:04.217
Inside or out?

38:04.252 --> 38:05.852
What's suspicious about it?

38:05.887 --> 38:08.288
What's suspicious about it?

38:11.259 --> 38:13.426
Knife wounds.

38:13.461 --> 38:16.029
Stomach...

38:16.063 --> 38:17.731
Chest...

38:17.765 --> 38:20.333
Hands...

38:20.368 --> 38:22.736
Fatal...

38:22.770 --> 38:27.674
So, there's no way this could
wait for the day tour, huh?

38:27.708 --> 38:30.010
Unresponsive.

38:30.044 --> 38:31.978
Yeah, no vitals at the time of arrival.

38:32.013 --> 38:34.047
That was like, 10 minutes ago.

38:34.081 --> 38:35.815
Let's say, 0220?

38:37.151 --> 38:38.351
All right.

38:43.791 --> 38:45.325
- Who's here?
- What do you mean?

38:45.359 --> 38:46.826
I mean who's here?

38:46.861 --> 38:47.694
You.

38:47.728 --> 38:49.429
Everybody else is up at Harlem Hospital.

38:49.463 --> 38:50.664
Those Agg-Assaults.

38:50.698 --> 38:52.799
Are Paul Mason and Shiyanov there?

38:52.833 --> 38:56.336
And don't give me any shit about
"life is cheap above 96th Street."

38:56.370 --> 38:57.571
We're cool.

39:01.475 --> 39:03.410
You know what?

39:03.444 --> 39:06.046
I'll call him.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.281
- Box?
- Yeah.

39:10.084 --> 39:11.918
I was gonna say.

39:26.100 --> 39:27.534
Box.

39:27.568 --> 39:30.437
Dennis. Danny Lang, Night Watch.

39:30.471 --> 39:31.605
Sorry to wake you.

39:31.639 --> 39:33.907
Just thought you might want to
get in on this from the jump.

39:33.941 --> 39:35.141
What do you got?

39:35.176 --> 39:37.877
Stabbing. Female, early 20s.

39:37.912 --> 39:41.715
144 West 87th Street. Inside.

39:41.749 --> 39:42.816
Brownstone?

39:42.850 --> 39:45.986
Yeah. It's gonna get
pretty photogenic out there.

39:50.825 --> 39:53.221
_

40:19.820 --> 40:22.289
- Where do you think you're going?
- Detective Box, son.

40:22.323 --> 40:23.723
Sorry, boss.

40:25.493 --> 40:28.328
Get the door before 10
more people trample through.

40:39.373 --> 40:40.740
Who made the call?

40:40.775 --> 40:42.976
Neighbor over there.

40:43.010 --> 40:45.578
Anybody else see anything?

40:45.613 --> 40:47.347
- Apparently not.
- Cameras?

40:47.381 --> 40:49.783
There's one up the street.
We're not sure if it's working.

40:49.817 --> 40:51.651
Pulling the film.

40:51.686 --> 40:53.053
Who's that?

40:53.087 --> 40:55.355
- He's ours.
- Reckless driving.

40:55.389 --> 40:57.557
You picked him up and brought
him here? What the fuck for?

40:57.591 --> 40:59.459
Well, we just pulled him
over when the call comes in...

40:59.493 --> 41:00.660
Well, I don't want him here.

41:00.695 --> 41:02.796
Get a unit. Take him back to
the house or cut him loose.

41:02.830 --> 41:06.066
- Uh, we'll take him, sir. We're off-duty...
- Not you. You stay.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.801
Let's get the neighbor
back to the house, too.

41:07.835 --> 41:09.502
He's famous enough out here already.

41:09.537 --> 41:11.905
No smoking on my crime scene.

41:11.939 --> 41:13.306
Go ahead, sir.

41:17.244 --> 41:18.712
All right, let's go.

41:18.746 --> 41:20.814
Where?

41:20.848 --> 41:22.682
Just get out of the car.

41:44.238 --> 41:46.539
Box wants you to take him to the station.

42:01.489 --> 42:03.423
Nice-looking kid.

42:04.592 --> 42:05.625
Yeah.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.635
What'd he do?

42:15.669 --> 42:17.570
- Who?
- Him.

42:18.839 --> 42:21.074
I don't know, he's a witness, isn't he?

42:23.411 --> 42:26.846
Hey, what'd you see?

42:26.881 --> 42:29.849
I didn't see nothing.

42:29.884 --> 42:32.552
Some witness he gon' make.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.627
Is she dead?

42:40.661 --> 42:43.096
I think that's safe to say.

43:06.053 --> 43:07.720
- Cop a squat.
- What?

43:07.755 --> 43:09.088
Sit down.

43:09.123 --> 43:12.258
Hey, did Maldonado
really puke at the scene?

43:12.293 --> 43:14.461
Must have been bad clams.

43:14.495 --> 43:16.262
Were there still a lot of guys there?

43:16.297 --> 43:19.132
I mean, that's a mess.

43:19.166 --> 43:20.400
Just stay still.

43:20.434 --> 43:21.968
West 87th Street.

43:22.002 --> 43:23.169
I mean, it's quiet.

43:23.204 --> 43:26.206
Yeah. All right.

43:26.240 --> 43:29.075
Yeah, Maldonado had us pick up this kid.

43:29.109 --> 43:30.643
Cup of coffee, man?

43:36.754 --> 43:39.644
_

43:41.055 --> 43:42.689
Knock, knock.

43:42.723 --> 43:44.791
- Hey.
- Watch where you step.

44:05.613 --> 44:07.847
Klein.

44:07.882 --> 44:10.583
Well, I was doing all right.
Then I answered the phone.

44:13.854 --> 44:15.588
How much you give me to check?

44:28.235 --> 44:31.037
I got a Pauline Rodriguez, will that do?

44:38.479 --> 44:39.846
Always a pleasure.

44:48.122 --> 44:50.823
Tom, hey, weekend or ED?

44:50.858 --> 44:52.425
Dustin. Blast from the past.

44:52.459 --> 44:54.928
Dust? Where the hell am
I supposed to park him?

44:54.962 --> 44:57.297
Take his ass to St. Luke's, please.

44:57.331 --> 44:58.498
Let's get him up.

44:58.532 --> 45:00.533
Up. Up.

45:33.567 --> 45:35.001
Fuck you lookin' at?

45:43.978 --> 45:46.379
What can you tell me
about the weapon, Harry?

45:46.413 --> 45:48.414
Pretty sure it's one knife.

45:48.449 --> 45:51.050
Approximately one and a half inch wide by,

45:51.085 --> 45:52.518
I'm gonna say,

45:52.553 --> 45:53.653
five inches long.

45:53.687 --> 45:55.421
Till I get her on the table and probe.

45:55.456 --> 45:56.756
Serrated, or no?

45:56.790 --> 45:59.025
Not sure yet. Possibly.

46:09.269 --> 46:10.603
What happened?

46:11.739 --> 46:13.373
What, you can't tell me nothing?

46:13.407 --> 46:15.008
Or you don't know nothing?

46:17.511 --> 46:21.014
Ain't that... That's where
that girl lives, right?

46:21.081 --> 46:23.783
I mean, what happened? What'd he
do? What, he kill her or something?

46:25.586 --> 46:27.487
I'm just playing, I'm just playing.

46:27.521 --> 46:29.489
But for real, what happened?

46:30.724 --> 46:33.359
You can't give out any information?

47:16.170 --> 47:17.403
Have a seat, sir.

47:17.438 --> 47:19.505
Someone will be right with you, all right?

47:20.407 --> 47:21.841
Hi, Sergeant.

47:21.875 --> 47:22.975
Hey, who's this?

47:23.010 --> 47:24.043
One wit.

47:24.078 --> 47:26.546
Sergeant told me to bring him in.

47:29.650 --> 47:31.617
All right, looks good. Any problems?

47:31.652 --> 47:33.086
Nope.

47:53.040 --> 47:55.074
Dad.

47:59.413 --> 48:01.180
You all right?

48:01.215 --> 48:03.316
Where's Naz?

48:03.350 --> 48:05.284
What?

48:06.587 --> 48:10.189
So, who's "he" in the sentence
"he kill her or something"?

48:10.224 --> 48:12.692
Uh, look, man, I was just saying.

48:12.726 --> 48:14.193
You were just saying what?

48:14.228 --> 48:18.131
I mean, you know, some
Arab dude she was with.

48:18.198 --> 48:20.233
Describe him.

48:20.267 --> 48:21.601
You know, an Arab dude.

48:21.635 --> 48:23.035
No, I don't.

48:23.070 --> 48:25.505
Look like he work at a deli or some shit.

48:25.539 --> 48:27.740
Try harder.

48:27.775 --> 48:31.511
Uh, like, little, short, skinny,

48:31.545 --> 48:33.579
Puerto Rican-looking
motherfucker with beanie eyes.

48:33.614 --> 48:36.849
How do you know he wasn't Puerto
Rican? Was he wearing anything Arabic?

48:36.884 --> 48:38.718
Nah, man, he...

48:38.752 --> 48:40.253
He had on his regular, you know,

48:40.287 --> 48:42.054
Friday night, go out and party shit.

48:42.089 --> 48:43.589
I mean, I tried to warn her, too.

48:43.624 --> 48:45.625
Yeah? How'd you go about doing that?

48:45.659 --> 48:48.027
I just told him right to his face.

48:48.061 --> 48:49.529
But you didn't know him.

48:49.563 --> 48:50.930
Nope.

48:50.964 --> 48:52.832
Never saw him before.

48:52.866 --> 48:54.267
Nope, nope.

48:54.301 --> 48:55.802
You know the girl?

48:55.836 --> 48:58.571
I mean, not <i>per se,</i>
you know what I'm saying?

48:58.605 --> 49:00.339
No, I don't.

49:00.374 --> 49:01.974
I mean, I know her type.

49:02.009 --> 49:03.509
What type is that?

49:05.112 --> 49:07.747
You know what, this coming out wrong.

49:07.781 --> 49:09.448
What's your name?

49:09.483 --> 49:11.617
How about you give me
your card or something,

49:11.652 --> 49:13.119
and then I just bang you on this later?

49:13.153 --> 49:14.921
My card.

49:14.955 --> 49:19.292
If I turn you upside down, how
much weed is gonna fall out?

49:20.761 --> 49:22.528
Oh, so that's how you do?

49:27.067 --> 49:28.835
See?

49:28.869 --> 49:30.937
No good deed goes unturned.

49:30.971 --> 49:32.471
Take him in.

49:33.707 --> 49:34.841
Let's go.

49:34.875 --> 49:38.911
Fuck LeBron. He can shit MVPs
out his ass year in, year out.

49:38.946 --> 49:41.180
He's still not gonna be able
to deliver rings like Kobe.

49:41.215 --> 49:43.082
Nah, nigga. Kobe ain't got no heart.

49:43.116 --> 49:44.584
Kobe ain't got no team, man.

49:44.618 --> 49:46.853
- Kobe is the team!
- That's the problem.

49:46.887 --> 49:48.654
81 points in one game, didn't he score?

49:48.689 --> 49:49.822
- He a overachiever.
- That's some...

49:49.857 --> 49:51.991
You got a fucking problem
you ain't passing the ball.

49:52.025 --> 49:53.025
Nigga was triple-teamed.

49:53.060 --> 49:54.794
- Look, why would he want to...
- Triple-teamed and...

49:54.828 --> 49:56.696
Why would he pass the ball if he...

49:56.730 --> 49:59.332
I roll with winners, homeboy.
I don't know about you.

49:59.366 --> 50:01.367
No, man, he good, he good. He great.

50:01.401 --> 50:02.869
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

50:02.903 --> 50:05.104
But LeBron James... LeBron James,

50:05.138 --> 50:08.007
look, he got a good two
inches on Kobe heightwise,

50:08.041 --> 50:09.709
and like three...

50:09.743 --> 50:11.444
- You know... 30 pounds.
- How long was LeBron...

50:11.478 --> 50:13.846
- How long was LeBron with them boys in Cleveland?
- Come on.

50:13.881 --> 50:15.214
What, like six years.

50:15.249 --> 50:18.551
What did he win for them?
What did he win for them?

50:31.064 --> 50:32.598
Who the hell is this?

50:32.633 --> 50:34.934
This is Nasir's father, Amir.

50:36.470 --> 50:37.570
Mr. Khan?

50:37.604 --> 50:38.971
Is he with you?

50:39.006 --> 50:40.172
No, sir.

50:40.207 --> 50:41.607
Do you know where he is?

50:41.642 --> 50:43.442
No. I haven't seen him.

50:43.477 --> 50:47.146
No, but he said you were
going out together tonight.

50:47.180 --> 50:51.350
Yeah, we were supposed to go
to a party, but I didn't go.

50:51.385 --> 50:52.952
So, where was this party?

50:54.621 --> 50:58.224
I have no idea. I don't
have the address on me.

51:28.722 --> 51:31.257
I don't know what you're doing here.

51:31.291 --> 51:34.160
I have witnesses to interview, do you?

51:34.194 --> 51:35.094
Go back out there.

51:35.128 --> 51:37.596
Sarge, we got 10,000
gold shields on the scene.

51:37.631 --> 51:40.066
- What do you need us out there for?
- It's called chain of custody.

51:40.100 --> 51:42.468
Didn't you go to the
academy like the other kids?

51:42.502 --> 51:44.603
And when you log it all, remember,

51:44.638 --> 51:46.439
blood stays with blood, hair with hair,

51:46.473 --> 51:48.975
photos with photos.

51:49.009 --> 51:50.609
Can I ask you guys something?

51:50.644 --> 51:53.779
Who's my friend over there who's been
staring at me like Bambi last two hours?

51:53.814 --> 51:56.215
Ah, shit, he's ours.

51:56.249 --> 51:57.850
You, sir.

51:59.619 --> 52:01.654
What is he, DWI? What'd he blow?

52:01.688 --> 52:03.456
He was supposed to get tested in the house.

52:03.490 --> 52:04.790
He didn't... I mean, you didn't?

52:04.825 --> 52:05.958
What, get the memo?

52:05.993 --> 52:08.194
- Who'd we tell to test?
- We told what's-his-name.

52:08.228 --> 52:09.295
What's-his-name.

52:09.329 --> 52:10.763
What's the matter, you
guys don't like overtime?

52:10.797 --> 52:13.399
- Who doesn't like overtime?
- You want, I'll test him right now.

52:13.433 --> 52:14.400
Now you're gonna test him.

52:14.434 --> 52:16.569
Test what? It's gone, if it was ever there.

52:16.603 --> 52:18.037
Just dodged a bullet here, kid.

52:18.071 --> 52:20.940
Get his pedigree, search him, clear
him of warrants, and kick him free.

52:20.974 --> 52:22.842
Put your hands on the railing for me.

52:22.876 --> 52:25.578
Be careful with the inventory vouchers.

52:25.612 --> 52:28.781
DCPI called, I'm like,
totally in the dark here.

52:28.815 --> 52:31.150
- Can you help me out?
- I'll do my best, Teddy.

52:31.184 --> 52:32.518
Uh, name?

52:32.552 --> 52:34.086
Nasir Khan.

52:34.121 --> 52:35.988
Victim's name is Andrea Cornish.

52:36.023 --> 52:37.356
Spell it.

52:37.391 --> 52:38.824
22 years old.

52:38.859 --> 52:40.426
N-a-s-i-r.

52:40.460 --> 52:42.461
- K-h-a-n.
- Caucasian.

52:42.496 --> 52:43.929
Found in a bedroom,

52:43.964 --> 52:45.464
in bed.

52:45.499 --> 52:47.666
- DOB?
- Stabbing homicide.

52:47.701 --> 52:50.603
- Um, 11/12/90.
- Suspect is a male.

52:50.637 --> 52:53.105
Unknown age, unknown race.

52:53.140 --> 52:54.607
This your current address?

52:54.641 --> 52:56.542
- Yeah.
- Seen leaving at approximately 0200

52:56.576 --> 52:59.111
running down the block hailing a taxi.

52:59.146 --> 53:01.313
I didn't say that he hailed a taxi.

53:01.348 --> 53:03.682
I said that he left in a taxi.

53:03.717 --> 53:04.950
That's what I said.

53:04.985 --> 53:06.786
His taxi.

53:08.989 --> 53:10.056
Fine.

53:10.090 --> 53:12.391
Is this what we do?
Dump our witnesses here?

53:12.426 --> 53:14.693
Somebody escort the
gentleman to the squad room.

53:14.728 --> 53:16.429
Uh, Frank, do you mind?

53:16.463 --> 53:18.564
Come with me, sir.

53:18.598 --> 53:20.433
Race, what are you?

53:20.467 --> 53:21.734
Uh, Pakistani.

53:21.768 --> 53:23.335
Asian Pacific or other.

53:23.370 --> 53:25.671
- Who's the other guy?
- What other guy?

53:25.705 --> 53:27.907
I was talking to who I said bring in.

53:27.941 --> 53:29.075
The one reeking weed.

53:29.109 --> 53:30.843
Who'd we tell?

53:30.877 --> 53:31.844
Bell.

53:31.878 --> 53:33.946
Nope. Brought him in.

53:33.980 --> 53:35.548
How many times stabbed?

53:35.582 --> 53:37.149
I didn't count, Teddy.

53:37.184 --> 53:39.151
- A lot.
- Occupation?

53:39.186 --> 53:40.186
Student.

53:40.220 --> 53:42.555
- Get it from Harry.
- Where?

53:42.589 --> 53:45.324
Please put your hands behind your
head for me, please, lock your fingers.

53:45.358 --> 53:46.926
- Where?
- Hudson College.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.327
Turn around.

53:51.164 --> 53:53.065
Weapon recovered?

53:53.100 --> 53:54.834
Not as yet.

53:54.868 --> 53:57.169
ESU's doing a toss of the house,

53:57.204 --> 53:59.939
street, dumpsters, grates, drains.

53:59.973 --> 54:03.342
What we're looking for is an
approximately five-inch-long,

54:03.376 --> 54:06.312
one-and-a-half-inch-wide,
possibly serrated...

54:09.349 --> 54:11.150
knife.

54:13.453 --> 54:14.920
Turn around.

54:17.157 --> 54:18.991
Do not move.

54:19.025 --> 54:20.593
You picked him up where, again?

54:20.627 --> 54:21.961
65th and Broadway.

54:21.995 --> 54:23.963
- No, wait, wait.
- What time?

54:23.997 --> 54:25.197
About 0200.

54:25.232 --> 54:26.265
I didn't do it.

54:26.299 --> 54:27.766
Didn't do what?

54:29.603 --> 54:31.470
What's your name, son?

54:33.473 --> 54:35.841
Nasir. You don't understand.

54:35.876 --> 54:38.277
That's why we're gonna talk, okay?

54:38.311 --> 54:39.512
So I will understand.

54:39.579 --> 54:41.480
Just you and me.

54:41.515 --> 54:42.715
Come over here.

54:42.749 --> 54:44.316
- Come on. Come on.
- Please, let go of me.

54:44.351 --> 54:45.818
No, no!

54:45.852 --> 54:47.019
I didn't do anything!

54:47.053 --> 54:49.622
- I didn't do anything!
- Put your hands behind your back!

54:49.656 --> 54:51.090
Give me your arm!

54:55.395 --> 54:57.129
Hey, hey, man,

54:57.164 --> 54:59.598
that's the dude I was talking
about. That's him, right there.

54:59.633 --> 55:01.500
Yeah. Hey, that's him.

55:01.535 --> 55:02.835
Aah!

55:02.869 --> 55:04.236
No!

55:04.271 --> 55:06.438
_

55:06.473 --> 55:09.308
Argh! No! No!

55:09.342 --> 55:11.243
I didn't do anything!

55:15.749 --> 55:17.416
Should we call the police?

55:17.450 --> 55:18.717
No.

55:35.869 --> 55:38.103
Remember what he said in the car?

55:40.040 --> 55:41.574
"Is she dead?"

56:07.534 --> 56:11.470
We didn't, uh, formally meet out there.

56:11.504 --> 56:14.139
I'm Detective Sergeant Dennis Box.

56:16.376 --> 56:18.444
So, Nasir.

56:18.478 --> 56:20.613
Is that what you like to be called, or?

56:20.647 --> 56:21.580
Naz.

56:21.615 --> 56:25.284
Naz. Okay. That's easy.

56:26.820 --> 56:29.555
So, Naz, what happened tonight?

56:32.192 --> 56:34.760
Did you know Andrea well, or just meet her?

56:37.097 --> 56:39.231
Just someone who got in your cab?

56:41.001 --> 56:42.568
My dad's cab.

56:42.602 --> 56:44.570
Your dad's cab, all right.

56:45.839 --> 56:48.474
You picked her up in the cab.

56:49.576 --> 56:50.843
Where?

56:53.813 --> 56:55.347
Naz...

56:56.483 --> 56:58.350
I don't know. Downtown somewhere.

56:58.385 --> 56:59.985
I was lost. I don't know.

57:00.020 --> 57:03.455
Okay. Then?

57:05.558 --> 57:07.526
Where did she say she wanted to go?

57:12.399 --> 57:14.300
The beach.

57:14.334 --> 57:16.068
The what?

57:16.102 --> 57:18.037
The beach.

57:18.071 --> 57:19.438
The beach?

57:23.710 --> 57:25.744
She say something, or...

57:25.779 --> 57:28.881
do something or behave
in some way to upset you?

57:30.083 --> 57:31.417
No.

57:31.451 --> 57:32.885
She must have said something.

57:32.919 --> 57:34.553
No.

57:34.587 --> 57:37.423
Naz, you said out there
I didn't understand.

57:37.457 --> 57:38.424
And you're right, I don't.

57:38.458 --> 57:41.493
That's what I'm trying to do here. I'm...

57:41.528 --> 57:44.063
It's why I'm here.

57:44.097 --> 57:46.398
To try to understand. To hear it from you.

57:46.433 --> 57:48.100
I don't have to do that, by the way.

57:48.134 --> 57:50.769
I want to.

57:50.804 --> 57:54.573
What you need to understand is what
you say to me here is very important.

57:54.607 --> 57:56.175
For you, not me.

57:56.209 --> 57:57.576
It can help you.

57:57.610 --> 57:59.812
I'm trying to help you. Help me help you.

58:02.749 --> 58:04.883
I can't breathe.

58:04.918 --> 58:06.018
Okay.

58:06.052 --> 58:08.253
That's okay, not uncommon. Just relax.

58:08.288 --> 58:09.455
No, I mean, I have asthma.

58:09.489 --> 58:12.224
Oh. You got something
to help you with that?

58:12.258 --> 58:14.159
No.

58:14.194 --> 58:15.928
You wanna go to the hospital?

58:17.597 --> 58:19.164
I wanna go home.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.034
You still on hold?

58:22.068 --> 58:23.569
Yes, I am.

58:23.603 --> 58:25.738
Where is this hospital?

58:25.772 --> 58:27.306
It's here, where do you think?

58:27.340 --> 58:29.508
Didn't he say he was going into Manhattan?

58:36.983 --> 58:39.585
"Is she dead?"

58:39.619 --> 58:41.086
What?

58:41.121 --> 58:44.523
That's what you asked the officers
in the car that brought you here.

58:44.557 --> 58:46.792
"Is she dead?"

58:46.826 --> 58:48.827
You don't remember saying that?

58:50.263 --> 58:53.098
They hadn't said anything
about her. Hadn't...

58:53.133 --> 58:55.100
said it was a she or a he,

58:55.135 --> 58:57.302
let alone dead, nobody had.

58:59.906 --> 59:03.475
So, you were at her place.
Can we agree on that?

59:03.510 --> 59:05.377
You have a couple drinks.

59:05.412 --> 59:06.645
Maybe a kiss.

59:06.679 --> 59:08.414
You have a couple more drinks and...

59:09.382 --> 59:11.917
And she's pretty, I know that. I saw her.

59:11.951 --> 59:13.552
What'd she do, say no?

59:13.586 --> 59:14.720
No.

59:14.754 --> 59:17.122
- Fought you?
- No.

59:17.157 --> 59:19.057
Then what happened, Naz?

59:22.495 --> 59:24.296
I don't know. I fell asleep.

59:24.330 --> 59:26.398
When I woke up,

59:26.433 --> 59:28.267
and she was like that...

59:28.301 --> 59:29.768
She was dead.

59:29.803 --> 59:31.770
And you, what did you do?

59:34.207 --> 59:36.074
I ran.

59:36.109 --> 59:38.243
'Cause I was scared.

59:38.278 --> 59:39.578
By what you'd done.

59:39.612 --> 59:41.280
No.

59:45.452 --> 59:48.020
What we're gonna do when we're done here,

59:48.054 --> 59:50.422
just so you know, is run some tests.

59:50.457 --> 59:52.524
You know why?

59:52.559 --> 59:54.460
Because you're a crime scene, Nasir.

59:54.494 --> 59:56.462
Just like the house,
and the cab, and Andrea.

59:56.496 --> 01:00:00.699
And it's our job to collect
everything we can from a crime scene.

01:00:00.733 --> 01:00:03.335
And here's what we're
gonna find, if you ask me.

01:00:03.369 --> 01:00:05.537
Her in the cab, the cab on her,

01:00:05.572 --> 01:00:07.940
you in the house, the house on you,

01:00:07.974 --> 01:00:09.575
you on her, her on you,

01:00:09.609 --> 01:00:11.443
the knife on you, her on the knife.

01:00:11.478 --> 01:00:13.011
I didn't kill her.

01:00:13.046 --> 01:00:15.147
You had sex with her.

01:00:16.683 --> 01:00:19.284
Yes. But it wasn't...

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.254
I didn't force her.

01:00:22.288 --> 01:00:23.489
I didn't say you did.

01:00:23.523 --> 01:00:26.024
She's only the second girl
I've ever slept with in my life.

01:00:26.059 --> 01:00:27.793
I liked her.

01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:32.731
She was nice.

01:00:32.765 --> 01:00:34.633
Look, I'm gonna be straight with you, Naz.

01:00:34.667 --> 01:00:36.502
Because what I'm looking at,

01:00:36.536 --> 01:00:39.805
the evidence already, the
eyewitnesses are so strong...

01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:42.841
you really need to start telling
me the truth for your sake.

01:00:42.876 --> 01:00:44.910
I am.

01:00:46.045 --> 01:00:47.546
You see that, right?

01:00:50.049 --> 01:00:51.583
That's recording us.

01:00:51.618 --> 01:00:53.185
And it will be used in court.

01:00:53.219 --> 01:00:55.087
How you think that's gonna come off?

01:00:55.121 --> 01:00:56.755
"She was nice, I liked her.

01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:58.123
But I killed her anyway."

01:00:58.157 --> 01:01:00.058
I didn't. I already told you, I...

01:01:01.361 --> 01:01:03.161
I can't remember.

01:01:03.196 --> 01:01:06.231
I have to tell you, that's
not gonna play any better.

01:01:06.266 --> 01:01:08.100
Judges and juries...

01:01:08.134 --> 01:01:10.068
they don't like "I can't remember."

01:01:10.103 --> 01:01:12.471
They like honesty. They like remorse.

01:01:12.505 --> 01:01:13.906
They like that a lot.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.074
That counts for something to them.

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:18.510
And even more to you.

01:01:18.545 --> 01:01:20.245
I'm talking about years.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.848
Honesty and remorse can
shave a lot of years off.

01:01:22.882 --> 01:01:25.918
So, you may want to revise that.

01:01:27.387 --> 01:01:29.121
Now's the time.

01:01:36.262 --> 01:01:37.529
All right.

01:01:37.564 --> 01:01:39.031
Let's go do what we have to do.

01:01:39.065 --> 01:01:40.866
We can talk again later.

01:01:48.608 --> 01:01:49.975
Come on.

01:01:56.583 --> 01:01:58.383
Take your clothes off.

01:02:21.074 --> 01:02:23.508
- What's...
- Shut the fuck up and take your shirt off.

01:02:41.327 --> 01:02:43.195
Don't look at me. Take your pants off.

01:03:22.735 --> 01:03:24.569
Sorry about that.

01:03:26.606 --> 01:03:29.808
Here. Put these on.

01:03:35.181 --> 01:03:36.648
Thank you.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.540
Hello?

01:04:01.574 --> 01:04:04.776
How long do I have to be
in here? I got things to do.

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:12.551
No, that's okay.

01:04:14.287 --> 01:04:16.254
Would you hang on a second, please?

01:04:16.289 --> 01:04:19.791
- Gentlemen, how's the scene?
- It's the Battle of Gettysburg.

01:04:19.826 --> 01:04:21.560
We'll be there all day.
Where's the birthday boy?

01:04:21.594 --> 01:04:23.361
- Upstairs.
- Thanks.

01:04:23.396 --> 01:04:26.298
Can you spell your name for me?

01:04:26.332 --> 01:04:27.733
Hey, yo, excuse me, miss?

01:04:27.767 --> 01:04:29.434
Hey, yo, can I call my moms?

01:04:29.469 --> 01:04:30.769
Go, go, come on.

01:04:30.803 --> 01:04:33.405
All right, I'll have one of our
detectives get in touch with you.

01:04:33.439 --> 01:04:35.574
Turn to your left.

01:04:35.608 --> 01:04:36.875
Turn to the other side.

01:04:36.909 --> 01:04:38.176
Take your shirt off.

01:04:38.211 --> 01:04:41.046
Make sure you get some close-ups
on those back scratches.

01:04:42.682 --> 01:04:44.082
Get a shot of that.

01:04:45.651 --> 01:04:47.119
Put your arms up.

01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:51.556
All right, put your hand here.

01:04:53.192 --> 01:04:54.559
Turn it over.

01:04:54.594 --> 01:04:57.429
Let's get a close-up. Thank you.

01:04:59.532 --> 01:05:02.367
I'd like to get a little swab
of the blood on your hands.

01:05:02.401 --> 01:05:04.269
A little swipe under the nails.

01:05:04.303 --> 01:05:05.904
A little bit off the
scratches on your back.

01:05:05.938 --> 01:05:08.907
And inside your cheek. Okay if I do that?

01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:10.742
I don't know. Is it?

01:05:10.777 --> 01:05:12.344
I need your consent, Naz.

01:05:12.378 --> 01:05:14.713
If you don't give it, then
I have to get a court order.

01:05:14.747 --> 01:05:16.481
And that will take about 45 minutes.

01:05:16.516 --> 01:05:18.517
So, it's not a problem.

01:05:18.551 --> 01:05:19.885
Except for you.

01:05:19.919 --> 01:05:21.653
Refusing looks bad to a jury.

01:05:21.687 --> 01:05:23.255
And I really don't want you disadvantaged.

01:05:23.289 --> 01:05:25.357
But it's up to you.

01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:26.792
You can say no.

01:05:28.761 --> 01:05:30.228
I didn't do it.

01:05:30.263 --> 01:05:31.363
Well, there you have it.

01:05:31.397 --> 01:05:33.031
You got nothing to fear, so,

01:05:33.065 --> 01:05:34.432
shall we go ahead and do it then?

01:05:34.467 --> 01:05:36.201
Your call.

01:05:38.571 --> 01:05:40.472
Say the words for me, Naz.

01:05:40.506 --> 01:05:41.807
Yes.

01:05:52.718 --> 01:05:54.219
Open your mouth.

01:06:00.827 --> 01:06:02.494
Oh, one more thing.

01:06:02.528 --> 01:06:04.629
I'm gonna need a penile swab, too.

01:06:04.664 --> 01:06:06.965
Is it okay if we do that next?

01:06:08.501 --> 01:06:09.901
Yes?

01:06:11.103 --> 01:06:12.470
Okay.

01:06:19.745 --> 01:06:20.912
You want me to stay?

01:06:22.415 --> 01:06:23.748
Will it hurt?

01:06:24.984 --> 01:06:26.351
No.

01:06:26.385 --> 01:06:28.019
Stand up.

01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:32.724
Drop your pants.

01:06:49.375 --> 01:06:50.709
That's good, good.

01:06:52.578 --> 01:06:54.546
Just... just relax.

01:07:00.152 --> 01:07:02.053
I think we're about done here?

01:07:02.088 --> 01:07:04.155
Box wanted palms and tips, too.

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:06.958
- I didn't hear him say that.
- Then don't do it.

01:07:06.993 --> 01:07:08.960
All right, try not to shake too much.

01:07:20.273 --> 01:07:22.340
I want a lawyer.

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:24.209
Oh, yeah, why?

01:07:24.243 --> 01:07:26.111
What do you mean, why?

01:07:26.145 --> 01:07:28.246
You know what kind of message that sends?

01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:31.049
Hey, what do we know. We're
just crime scene unit guys.

01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:33.652
So, why don't you wait till
the squad detectives come back,

01:07:33.686 --> 01:07:35.420
and get into all that with them.

01:07:35.454 --> 01:07:38.456
Seriously though, kid, look
before you leap, is what I say.

01:07:38.491 --> 01:07:40.458
Okay. We're done here.

01:07:42.995 --> 01:07:44.296
Wipe up.

01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:51.603
Here's my card.

01:07:51.637 --> 01:07:54.806
250 bucks. I'll meet you there.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.308
You'll be okay.

01:07:56.342 --> 01:07:58.777
Will you take a check?

01:07:58.811 --> 01:08:00.545
- For you, Paul?
- Pauline.

01:08:00.579 --> 01:08:03.248
Pauline, I'm sorry.

01:08:03.282 --> 01:08:05.951
A cashier's check's okay.

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:34.979
Hey, what's with Gunga Din in there?

01:08:35.014 --> 01:08:37.247
- Who?
- The big-eyed kid.

01:08:37.283 --> 01:08:39.684
- The kid?
- Yeah, in the pen.

01:08:39.719 --> 01:08:41.019
Oh, him.

01:08:41.053 --> 01:08:43.020
He cut a girl on 87th Street.

01:08:43.055 --> 01:08:45.490
Who did?

01:08:45.524 --> 01:08:50.060
They're called razors, Jack,
you should invest. Experiment.

01:08:50.095 --> 01:08:52.863
Worse comes to worst, it all grows back.

01:09:19.825 --> 01:09:21.126
All right, my man.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.761
All we need now is the
knife and clothes and shoes.

01:09:23.796 --> 01:09:26.064
I sent all that over before you got here.

01:09:26.098 --> 01:09:27.232
Who did?

01:09:27.265 --> 01:09:28.700
Two of my unis drove it over.

01:09:29.702 --> 01:09:31.403
You always break chain
of evidence like that?

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:34.104
Relax. It's all there, neat and tidy.

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.441
Here's a voucher.

01:09:36.475 --> 01:09:38.910
- They handed it to Mathis?
- He's their dispatcher?

01:09:38.944 --> 01:09:42.147
Apparently with the Battle of Gettysburg
and all, he was the only one there.

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.182
Hey, nobody told me you were coming here.

01:09:44.216 --> 01:09:46.751
Yet here we are.

01:09:46.786 --> 01:09:49.287
Thought I was doing you guys
a favor. The fuck do I know?

01:09:49.321 --> 01:09:51.055
Next time, wait for us.

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:52.924
Next time, call first.

01:09:57.997 --> 01:09:59.297
What are you doing?

01:09:59.331 --> 01:10:01.232
I'm here to see my client.

01:10:01.267 --> 01:10:04.035
- You just did.
- Not him... her.

01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:05.403
Him.

01:10:19.452 --> 01:10:22.620
Your man is here, as it were,

01:10:22.655 --> 01:10:24.255
Johnny the Red.

01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:26.224
Bye now.

01:10:27.793 --> 01:10:30.095
And don't lose that key!

01:10:30.129 --> 01:10:32.831
25 years, the Berlin Wall comes down,

01:10:32.865 --> 01:10:37.235
and this throwback's still
going on about communists.

01:10:37.269 --> 01:10:40.605
So, Nazir... Nasir.

01:10:40.639 --> 01:10:42.874
Is that what I call you or...

01:10:42.908 --> 01:10:44.709
- Naz.
- You're a citizen, Naz?

01:10:44.743 --> 01:10:45.710
What... who are you?

01:10:45.744 --> 01:10:48.012
Your lawyer. You a U.S. citizen?

01:10:48.047 --> 01:10:49.447
- You're like, a public defender?
- No.

01:10:49.482 --> 01:10:50.715
You're a citizen?

01:10:50.749 --> 01:10:51.716
Yeah.

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.351
Guess number one:

01:10:53.385 --> 01:10:55.253
Pakistani by blood?

01:10:55.287 --> 01:10:56.788
- Yeah, my mom.
- What is she?

01:10:56.822 --> 01:10:59.390
Punjabi, Pashtun, Baluch?

01:10:59.425 --> 01:11:01.126
Punjabi.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.061
- You been to Pakistan?
- No.

01:11:03.095 --> 01:11:04.696
Have you?

01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:05.864
No.

01:11:09.001 --> 01:11:10.335
It's eczema.

01:11:10.369 --> 01:11:12.170
Dermatologist says to keep them aerated.

01:11:12.204 --> 01:11:13.905
Like that's gonna cure anything.

01:11:13.939 --> 01:11:16.141
I don't know, maybe it
helps. I really can't tell.

01:11:16.175 --> 01:11:17.709
You ever been arrested?

01:11:17.743 --> 01:11:18.610
No.

01:11:18.644 --> 01:11:21.246
- Pissing in public, littering, anything?
- No.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.449
Well, first time for everything, right?

01:11:25.584 --> 01:11:27.018
Don't worry about my feet.

01:11:27.052 --> 01:11:28.386
It's not contagious.

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:29.587
How's your politics?

01:11:29.622 --> 01:11:30.755
What do you mean, my politics?

01:11:30.789 --> 01:11:32.557
Well, not to sound like a tea-bagger,

01:11:32.591 --> 01:11:34.759
but how do you feel about America?

01:11:34.793 --> 01:11:37.228
Well, I'm American. I was born here.

01:11:37.263 --> 01:11:40.265
Name two Yankees headed
for the Hall of Fame?

01:11:40.299 --> 01:11:41.866
- Why?
- One Mississippi...

01:11:41.901 --> 01:11:43.101
Rivera and Jeter.

01:11:43.135 --> 01:11:45.036
Good.

01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:46.204
Married?

01:11:46.238 --> 01:11:48.039
No.

01:11:48.073 --> 01:11:51.242
So, as a good Muslim boy,
you live with your parents?

01:11:51.277 --> 01:11:52.243
Yeah.

01:11:52.278 --> 01:11:53.478
Talk to them yet?

01:11:53.512 --> 01:11:54.579
They took my phone.

01:11:54.613 --> 01:11:55.647
Talk to anyone?

01:11:55.681 --> 01:11:56.915
N... What do you mean?

01:11:56.949 --> 01:11:58.750
- Here.
- Like, who?

01:11:58.784 --> 01:12:01.553
It's not a tough question.
Like cops, who else is there?

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.221
Uh, I talked to one.

01:12:03.255 --> 01:12:04.889
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

01:12:04.924 --> 01:12:07.659
Tell me he told you you had to?

01:12:07.693 --> 01:12:09.527
He didn't.

01:12:09.562 --> 01:12:11.829
Tell me he didn't read you your rights?

01:12:11.864 --> 01:12:14.232
They did.

01:12:18.704 --> 01:12:20.371
I may need you to come down again.

01:12:20.406 --> 01:12:22.874
So, don't like, run off to
Europe without telling me.

01:12:22.908 --> 01:12:27.212
Do I look like someone running
off to Europe anytime soon?

01:12:27.246 --> 01:12:29.280
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:12:29.315 --> 01:12:31.783
You may go home and get some sleep now.

01:12:38.724 --> 01:12:39.991
Almost done?

01:12:40.025 --> 01:12:41.259
Yeah. You?

01:12:41.293 --> 01:12:42.727
Yeah.

01:12:42.761 --> 01:12:44.896
Let's get out of here before they...

01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:46.264
Don't look up.

01:12:48.634 --> 01:12:50.702
Hit print, let's go.

01:12:50.736 --> 01:12:52.403
You two were first on the scene, right?

01:12:52.438 --> 01:12:54.439
Yeah. Just finished the DD-5s.

01:12:54.473 --> 01:12:56.207
Everything's done. We're going home.

01:12:57.176 --> 01:12:58.509
Upstairs.

01:12:58.544 --> 01:13:01.746
Sir, we were supposed to
be off like five hours ago.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.848
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:13:03.882 --> 01:13:06.050
- So...
- So come upstairs.

01:13:12.925 --> 01:13:14.692
This was when?

01:13:14.727 --> 01:13:17.161
I don't know, what time is it now, 4:00?

01:13:17.196 --> 01:13:18.363
6:00.

01:13:18.397 --> 01:13:20.798
6:00! What time am I getting out of here?

01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:24.068
Never, if you keep answering
questions with questions.

01:13:27.006 --> 01:13:28.573
What was the question again?

01:13:28.607 --> 01:13:30.808
What time it was when you saw them,

01:13:30.843 --> 01:13:33.378
as you put it, rubbing
up against each other?

01:13:33.412 --> 01:13:35.780
I wanna say...

01:13:35.814 --> 01:13:37.615
10:00, 11:00, something like that.

01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:39.083
You were alone?

01:13:40.152 --> 01:13:41.619
Yeah.

01:13:41.654 --> 01:13:42.787
Doing what?

01:13:42.821 --> 01:13:44.055
Just walking.

01:13:44.089 --> 01:13:47.358
On West 87th Street a block from the park?

01:13:47.393 --> 01:13:49.627
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

01:13:54.133 --> 01:13:55.466
Is this her?

01:13:56.969 --> 01:13:58.603
Yeah, that's her.

01:14:00.372 --> 01:14:01.606
Is he on this?

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.375
I just told you that was
him out there on the floor,

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:06.844
like, hours ago. What
more do you want from me?

01:14:06.879 --> 01:14:08.346
I want you to look at it,

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.448
and tell me if he's on it or not.

01:14:17.122 --> 01:14:20.091
This towelhead right here.

01:14:20.125 --> 01:14:22.193
Just the number, not the op-ed.

01:14:22.227 --> 01:14:24.862
Four. Number four.

01:14:24.897 --> 01:14:26.864
Initial it for me.

01:14:35.107 --> 01:14:36.374
Thank you, Trevor.

01:14:40.312 --> 01:14:42.880
Okay, Naz, listen to me,

01:14:42.915 --> 01:14:45.183
don't talk to anybody anymore.

01:14:45.217 --> 01:14:47.318
Anyone asks you anything, how you doing,

01:14:47.353 --> 01:14:48.553
isn't it a nice day?

01:14:48.587 --> 01:14:49.787
You say, "Gee, I don't know.

01:14:49.822 --> 01:14:52.790
Talk to my lawyer." Okay? Say it.

01:14:52.825 --> 01:14:55.059
- Okay.
- No, no, say that to me.

01:14:55.094 --> 01:14:56.160
I don't know...

01:14:56.195 --> 01:14:57.462
- I don't know.
- Talk to...

01:14:57.496 --> 01:14:58.663
Talk to my lawyer.

01:14:58.697 --> 01:15:01.332
Good. I've been an "I
don't know" guy all my life.

01:15:01.367 --> 01:15:03.901
It's never let me down.

01:15:03.936 --> 01:15:05.036
Where are you going?

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:07.572
To see if I can get you
out of here. Short of that,

01:15:07.606 --> 01:15:09.040
get your phone call.

01:15:10.676 --> 01:15:12.110
You know what they're saying I did?

01:15:12.144 --> 01:15:13.911
I don't. And I don't care.

01:15:13.946 --> 01:15:16.414
Until they charge you,
you didn't do anything.

01:15:17.783 --> 01:15:19.283
Guard!

01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:26.591
Don't go anywhere.

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:27.892
Thanks, Wayne.

01:15:30.429 --> 01:15:32.163
You know what I wonder?

01:15:32.197 --> 01:15:33.831
Where'd it all go wrong?

01:15:33.866 --> 01:15:36.501
The cop who first built
one of these counters,

01:15:36.535 --> 01:15:38.403
how tall you think he was?

01:15:41.473 --> 01:15:43.474
I want to take the kid out of here.

01:15:43.509 --> 01:15:44.475
No shit.

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:45.777
Is he being charged?

01:15:45.811 --> 01:15:47.779
- Oh, yeah.
- With?

01:15:47.813 --> 01:15:49.447
Possession of a weapon, for now.

01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:52.250
Misdemeanor desk appearance.
Let's get him to a judge.

01:15:52.284 --> 01:15:55.253
Not gonna happen. They like him
for this 87th Street thing big time.

01:15:55.287 --> 01:15:56.554
Who's they?

01:15:56.588 --> 01:15:57.622
Box.

01:15:57.656 --> 01:15:59.924
The fuck's he got to do with it?

01:15:59.958 --> 01:16:01.225
What do you think?

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.628
Lieberman said he cut a girl.

01:16:03.662 --> 01:16:05.563
"Cut" is right.

01:16:07.332 --> 01:16:10.101
- She's dead?
- Uh-huh.

01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:13.738
And it's Box?

01:16:13.772 --> 01:16:15.640
Uh-huh.

01:16:15.674 --> 01:16:16.974
Fuck.

01:16:29.087 --> 01:16:30.121
Naz?

01:16:31.223 --> 01:16:34.258
Listen, I'm at a police station.

01:16:34.293 --> 01:16:36.661
And it... it's all a mistake.

01:16:36.695 --> 01:16:39.564
They've arrested me. They
think I did something.

01:16:44.603 --> 01:16:46.237
Murder.

01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:53.444
Is he hurt?
