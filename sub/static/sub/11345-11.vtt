IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.209 --> 00:11.779
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.315
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.348 --> 00:16.350
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.384 --> 00:17.718
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.751 --> 00:19.520
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.723
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.756 --> 00:26.227
[calliope music]

00:26.260 --> 00:31.099
[bell ringing]

00:31.132 --> 00:34.602
- NEED A HAND
GETTING 'EM OFF, MA'AM?

00:34.635 --> 00:37.071
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
MISS, YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:37.105 --> 00:39.173
COME ON, GUYS, LET'S GO.
LET'S GO, EVERYBODY.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.674
LET'S GO, KID.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.677
FAKE SLEEPING AIN'T GONNA GET
YOU A FREE RIDE.

00:47.481 --> 00:51.119
OH. OH, CRAP.
SOM--SOMEBODY CALL 911!

00:54.422 --> 00:56.457
- ANY FRANTIC PARENTS
REPORT A MISSING KID?

00:56.490 --> 00:58.126
- NO PARENTS, NO I.D.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.093
ALL WE HAVE ARE THE CLOTHES
ON HIS BACK.

00:59.127 --> 01:01.295
- SOMEBODY HAD TO SEE
WHERE HE CAME FROM.

01:01.329 --> 01:04.432
- UNLESS HE HOPPED THE FENCE.
WE'LL KEEP LOOKING.

01:04.465 --> 01:07.435
- INTERNAL BODY TEMP'S DOWN
A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO DEGREES.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.470
- SO HE'S BEEN DEAD
A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.705
- YOU'RE GETTING GOOD AT THIS.
- I WISH I WEREN'T.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.541
- HE'S GOT CLEAN CLOTHES,
NEW SHOES.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.509
DOESN'T LOOK HOMELESS.
- MIGHT HAVE RUN AWAY.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.178
I WOULD HAVE.

01:17.211 --> 01:20.281
BRUISES--
YELLOW AND HEALING.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.350
- HOW OLD?
- AS LONG AS TWO WEEKS,

01:22.383 --> 01:23.684
COULD BE AS LITTLE
AS 18 HOURS.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.186
- COULD HE DIE
FROM THIS INJURY?

01:25.219 --> 01:26.754
- I WON'T KNOW
TILL I DO THE AUTOPSY.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.223
- WELL, ONE THING WE DO KNOW.

01:29.257 --> 01:32.126
SOMEONE BEAT THE HELL
OUT OF THIS KID.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.582
- SO THIS KID WAS DEAD
ON THE CAROUSEL

02:28.616 --> 02:29.817
FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR
BEFORE THE OPERATOR NOTICED?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.352
- HE SAYS IT WAS CROWDED,

02:31.385 --> 02:33.187
AND HE DIDN'T CHECK
AFTER EACH RIDE.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.522
THE KID MUST HAVE SNUCK ON.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.290
- WE HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE CAME FROM?

02:36.324 --> 02:37.891
- UH, SCHOOL SAFETY HAS CHECKED
EVERY ELEMENTARY

02:37.925 --> 02:39.527
SOUTH OF 96TH STREET.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.362
THERE'S NO REPORTS
OF ANY KIDS GOING AWOL.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.531
- WELL, THERE'S LOTS
OF AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITIES HERE,

02:43.564 --> 02:44.865
PLENTY OF CAMERAS ALL AROUND.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.667
- YEAH, ELLIOT'S GOING
THROUGH THE VIDEO NOW.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.770
- WE NOTIFY MISSING PERSONS?
- [sighs] THERE'S NOTHING.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.605
NOTHING FITTING
JOHNNY DOE'S DESCRIPTION.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.841
I MEAN, BUT IT'S STILL
EARLY, RIGHT?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.809
SO THE PARENTS MAY NOT EVEN KNOW
THAT HE'S GONE.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.878
AH, WHICH IS WHAT
I NEED TO BE.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.614
I'VE GOT TO FIND THE MISSING
WITNESS ON THE MORAN TRIAL.

03:00.648 --> 03:01.882
- ALL RIGHT, GO.
WE'LL GET THIS DONE.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.584
- OKAY.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.819
- I WILL GET PATROL
TO LEND US SOME BODIES.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.355
YOU AND I'LL SPLIT UP
AND CANVASS.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.889
- NO NEED.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.524
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA CAUGHT HIM
GETTING OUT OF A CAB

03:10.558 --> 03:12.560
TWO HOURS AGO--

03:12.593 --> 03:15.929
CAB NUMBER 5Y62.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.534
- JOE GILBERT?

03:20.568 --> 03:22.236
- YEAH.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.239
- TRIP SHEET.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.308
- YOU DRIVING THE CAB
ALL DAY?

03:27.341 --> 03:28.809
- YEAH. YOU GUYS WANT
TO TELL ME WHAT'S UP?

03:28.842 --> 03:30.478
- YOU DIDN'T LIST
ALL YOUR FARES.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.480
WHAT, YOU PLAYING
A LITTLE BEAT THE METER, JOE?

03:32.513 --> 03:33.714
- NO, NOT ME.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.649
I WRITE 'EM ALL DOWN,
AND I REMEMBER THEM.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.485
- DO YOU?
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN TELL US

03:37.518 --> 03:40.754
WHERE HE GOT IN,
2:00 THIS AFTERNOON.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.956
- THAT'S MY NEPHEW ETHAN.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.826
SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HIM?

03:47.861 --> 03:49.730
- TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.832
BROKEN RIB PUNCTURED HIS LUNG.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.567
AIR ESCAPED
INTO THE CHEST CAVITY

03:53.601 --> 03:55.303
UNTIL THE PRESSURE
COLLAPSED BOTH LUNGS.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.837
- OKAY, SO WHOEVER HIT ETHAN

03:56.870 --> 03:58.472
BROKE HIS RIB
AND CAUSED HIS DEATH.

03:58.506 --> 04:01.409
IT'S A HOMICIDE.
- NOT NECESSARILY.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.577
I FOUND SEVERE CONTUSIONS
AND CRUSH INJURIES

04:03.611 --> 04:05.045
TO THE MUSCLES
AND CONNECTIVE TISSUES

04:05.078 --> 04:06.947
OF HIS HIPS AND BUTTOCKS
ABOUT A WEEK OLD.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.816
- WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME?

04:08.849 --> 04:11.519
- ETHAN'S DEATH COULD HAVE
BEEN CAUSED BY AN ACCIDENT.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.886
UNTIL YOU FIND OUT,

04:12.920 --> 04:16.690
I HAVE TO RULE IT
INCONCLUSIVE.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.259
- THE MOTHER'S HERE.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.864
- [sobbing]

04:23.897 --> 04:26.300
THAT'S HIM.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.835
OH, NO.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.671
MY BABY.
- IT'S OKAY.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.873
- [sobbing] MY BABY.
- OKAY.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.675
OKAY.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.477
- WE'RE SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS,
MS. GILBERT.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.312
- DOES ETHAN'S FATHER KNOW?

04:38.346 --> 04:41.515
- UH, MY BROTHER DIED LAST YEAR
BREATHING DUST AT GROUND ZERO.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.584
NOW THIS.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.654
- WE'RE HOPING YOU CAN HELP US
FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.556
DID ETHAN SEEM OKAY

04:48.589 --> 04:51.091
WHEN HE WENT OFF
TO SCHOOL THIS MORNING?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.993
- NO. HE SAID HE HAD
A STOMACHACHE,

04:53.026 --> 04:54.928
SO I KEPT HIM HOME.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.630
- ETHAN STAYED WITH YOU
LAST NIGHT?

04:56.664 --> 04:59.467
- I WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT.
JOE'S BEEN HELPING OUT.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.535
- BOY NEEDS A DAD.

05:01.569 --> 05:02.836
- IF HE WAS SICK, WHY'D YOU
DROP HIM OFF IN CHELSEA?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.972
- I STOPPED HOME FOR LUNCH.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.940
ETHAN SAID
HE WAS FEELING BETTER,

05:06.974 --> 05:09.443
ASKED IF HE COULD GO
TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY...

05:09.477 --> 05:11.044
DOWN AT THE BOWLING ALLEY
BY THE PARK,

05:11.078 --> 05:12.613
SO I JUST
DROPPED HIM OFF EARLY.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.515
- HOW DID MY BOY DIE?

05:14.548 --> 05:16.784
- OUR M.E. SAYS A BROKEN RIB

05:16.817 --> 05:19.720
PUNCTURED HIS LUNG.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.989
- OH, MY GOD.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.957
IT WAS HIM.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.826
- WHO?
- A KID AT SCHOOL.

05:25.859 --> 05:30.498
TWO WEEKS AGO, ETHAN CAME HOME
WITH A BLACK EYE,

05:30.531 --> 05:33.734
AND HE TOLD ME
HE WALKED INTO A DOOR.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.404
[sniffles]
AND I BELIEVED HIM.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.538
- TILL I FOUND OUT
IT WAS REALLY THIS KID,

05:37.571 --> 05:38.906
BLAKE MURPHY.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.008
- SO HE WAS BEING BULLIED.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.876
- YOU KNOW HOW KIDS ARE.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.745
SCHOOL MADE A FEDERAL CASE
OUT OF NOTHING.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.714
BLAKE, GET YOUR HEINIE
OUT HERE.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.616
- WELL, HE DID ASSAULT
A TEACHER.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.883
- AND I GOT TO TAKE A WEEK OFF
FROM WORK WITHOUT PAY

05:49.917 --> 05:51.585
TO STAY HOME WITH HIM.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.621
BLAKE!

05:53.654 --> 05:56.457
DAMN IT! I TOLD YOU,
THIS ISN'T VACATION!

05:56.490 --> 05:57.458
- WHAT THE--

05:59.126 --> 06:01.094
WHO ARE THESE DUDES?
- THE POLICE, DUDE.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.963
- WE'RE HERE
ABOUT ETHAN GILBERT.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.533
HE'S DEAD.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.768
- BLAKE, WHAT DID YOU DO?
- NO, MOM, I SWEAR!

06:07.801 --> 06:10.438
- BLAKE, YOU BEAT UP
ETHAN AT SCHOOL?

06:10.471 --> 06:12.606
- NO, I DIDN'T BEAT HIM UP, BUT
I SHOULD'VE, 'CAUSE HE HIT ME.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.408
- OH, ETHAN WAS HITTING YOU?

06:14.442 --> 06:16.076
- YEAH, THE DAY
BEFORE THEY SUSPENDED ME,

06:16.109 --> 06:17.745
HE TOLD ME HE WAS LEARNING
HOW TO FIGHT

06:17.778 --> 06:18.979
SO HE COULD KICK MY ASS.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.948
- HE SAY WHO WAS TEACHING
HIM HOW TO FIGHT?

06:20.981 --> 06:23.083
- YEAH, HIS--HIS UNCLE JOE.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.689
- CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE JOE GILBERT IS?

06:28.722 --> 06:31.825
- I CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.
I CAN SHOW YOU WHERE HE IS.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.463
- YOU GOT ALL YOUR CABS
ON GPS?

06:35.496 --> 06:37.631
- MM-HMM. SO I KNOW
THEY'RE OUT MAKING MONEY

06:37.665 --> 06:40.634
INSTEAD OF SCREWING AROUND.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.476
- INWOOD HILL PARK?

06:48.509 --> 06:50.644
HE'S NOT PICKING UP
ANY FARES THERE.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.113
- YEAH, AND HE WON'T HAVE A JOB
WHEN HE GETS BACK EITHER.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.181
HE HASN'T MOVED
IN HALF AN HOUR.

07:03.491 --> 07:05.626
- OVER THERE
THROUGH THE TREES.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.561
- I GOT JOE.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.699
- WHAT THE HELL'S
HE PAYING HIM FOR?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.941
[overlapping shouting]

07:34.254 --> 07:37.758
- POLICE!
DON'T MOVE!

07:37.791 --> 07:39.827
- YEAH, NICE!

07:39.860 --> 07:41.595
- HEY, HEY, YOU!
BACK UP, BACK UP!

07:41.629 --> 07:43.230
- GET OVER THERE!
YOU, OVER THERE!

07:43.263 --> 07:45.265
- HEY, YOU, GET ON THE CAR!
- GET UP.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.668
PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE HOOD.
- PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE CAR.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.670
- NOBODY'S BREAKING
ANY LAWS, OFFICER.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.739
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME, DOUCHE BAG?
- HANK ROBERTS.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.741
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.576
- DON'T MOVE.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.277
HIYA, JOE.
HOW YOU DOING?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.846
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

07:58.879 --> 08:00.814
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.550
- UH-HUH.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

08:02.583 --> 08:03.984
- NICKY ROBERTS.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.619
- WHAT WERE YOU TWO
FIGHTING ABOUT?

08:05.653 --> 08:09.723
- NOTHING. WE'RE IN A CLUB.
WE DO IT FOR FUN.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.902
- HOW YOU FEELING, CHAMP?

08:21.935 --> 08:24.838
- I LOST.
- WELL, YOU GOT SUCKERED.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.741
I GUESS THAT WAS
KIND OF MY FAULT.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.943
SO YOU AND THIS ANTHONY KID,
YOU FIGHT A LOT?

08:29.977 --> 08:31.912
- JUST TONIGHT.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.782
- HOW'D YOU MEET HIM?

08:34.815 --> 08:37.117
- POP SET IT UP.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.952
- WHICH ONE'S YOUR DAD?
- THE GUY IN THE HOODIE--

08:38.986 --> 08:40.153
HANK ROBERTS.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.922
IS HE HERE?

08:41.955 --> 08:43.624
- HE'S IN ANOTHER ROOM.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.293
HANK SEEMS A LITTLE YOUNG
TO BE YOUR DAD.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.662
- HE MARRIED MY MOM
FIVE YEARS AGO.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.698
HE ADOPTED ME AND SAYS
HE GAVE ME HIS NAME,

08:50.731 --> 08:53.100
SO I HAVE TO CALL HIM POP.
- UH-HUH.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.235
AND DOES POP
LIKE YOU TO FIGHT?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.037
- SAYS IT'S TOUGHENING ME UP.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.807
- THEY MAKE YOU DO IT?

08:59.840 --> 09:02.042
[door opens]

09:02.075 --> 09:04.177
- MOM.
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.713
- MRS. ROBERTS,
I'M DETECTIVE STABLER.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.848
- SAVE IT.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.650
- EXCUSE--EXCUSE ME.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.685
I'M NOT FINISHED TALKING
WITH YOUR SON.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.220
- OH, YES, YOU ARE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.789
WHERE'S MY HUSBAND?
- HE'S LOCKED UP.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.224
- NOT FOR LONG.
- MRS. ROBERTS,

09:17.257 --> 09:19.059
YOUR SON WAS FIGHTING
ANOTHER BOY.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.861
YOUR HUSBAND
WAS BETTING ON 'EM.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.764
- YOU TOUCH ME AGAIN,
AND I WILL SCREAM.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.676
- LET'S GO.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.878
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE LETTING BARONE WALK?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.681
- NOT ME--HARDWICKE.
SAID NO PRIORS, FIRST OFFENSE.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.082
TOLD ME TO WRITE HIM
A DESK-APPEARANCE TICKET

09:42.115 --> 09:43.717
AND CUT HIM LOOSE.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.919
- HEY. HEY.
A DESK APPEARANCE?

09:45.953 --> 09:47.955
WHAT'S WHAT?

09:47.988 --> 09:49.723
- PROMOTING GAMBLING.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.358
- THOSE DIRTBAGS
ARE FORCING THEIR SONS

09:51.391 --> 09:53.694
INTO BARE-KNUCKLE
FIST FIGHTING.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.029
- NO, NO, WAIT. DID--DID NICKY
SAY HANK FORCED HIM TO FIGHT?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.065
- LOOK, HE WAS SCARED,
BUT WE SAW WHAT WE SAW.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.667
- THESE BOZOS RISK
THEIR KIDS' LIVES

09:59.700 --> 10:01.769
FOR A COUPLE OF BUCKS.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.236
- AND UNLESS IT WAS
AGAINST THE BOYS' WILL,

10:03.270 --> 10:04.738
THE LAW CONSIDERS IT SPORT.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.173
- SO COCKFIGHTING
OR DOG FIGHTING,

10:06.206 --> 10:07.875
THEY SEE JAIL TIME,

10:07.908 --> 10:09.777
BUT IF THERE'S A DEAD KID,
THEY GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.645
- WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DEAD KID?

10:11.679 --> 10:13.180
- ETHAN GILBERT.
HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.415
HE DIED YESTERDAY
ON THE CAROUSEL IN CHELSEA.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.118
AND TONIGHT WE SAW
HIS UNCLE JOE

10:18.151 --> 10:20.854
PAYING OFF
NICKY'S STEPDAD.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.190
- PRESUMABLY BECAUSE ETHAN
LOST A FIGHT AGAINST NICKY.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.958
- YOU'RE SAYING ETHAN
DIED OF INJURIES

10:24.992 --> 10:26.794
FROM THIS PRESUMED FIGHT.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.663
- OH, NO, THERE WAS A FIGHT.
WE JUST HAVE TO PROVE IT.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.735
- I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.970
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WE WERE DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.739
- WELL, PROMOTING GAMBLING
IS ILLEGAL,

10:38.772 --> 10:39.940
SO I'M GONNA ISSUE
YOU A SUMMONS.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.075
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO APPEAR
IN COURT.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.712
- SO ALL THIS DRAMA
FOR A TICKET.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.079
YOU COULD HAVE WRITTEN THAT
TWO HOURS AGO.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.281
- NO. WE HAVE OTHER ISSUES
TO CLEAR UP.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.683
- YEAH, LIKE WHAT?

10:49.717 --> 10:51.051
- WELL, WHY DON'T WE START

10:51.084 --> 10:53.854
WITH JOE GILBERT
AND THAT WAD OF CASH

10:53.887 --> 10:54.988
THAT HE HANDED
OVER TO YOU TONIGHT.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.057
- JOE OWED ME SOME MONEY.
- MM-HMM.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.960
BECAUSE HIS NEPHEW
LOST A FIGHT TO YOUR SON.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.963
- NO, I LOANED JOE SOME CASH
SO HE COULD GET HIS CAR FIXED.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.265
HE CAME BACK OVER TO THE PARK
TO PAY ME BACK,

11:05.298 --> 11:07.334
END OF STORY.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.436
- REALLY?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.872
BECAUSE JOE IS NEXT DOOR
RIGHT NOW

11:11.905 --> 11:13.807
DOING AN AWFUL LOT OF TALKING

11:13.841 --> 11:16.910
SINCE HE FOUND OUT
HE'S FACING A MURDER RAP.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.046
- MURDER?
NO, NOBODY MURDERED ETHAN.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.814
- YOU DID...

11:20.848 --> 11:22.415
TWO NIGHTS AGO WHEN YOU
TOOK HIM TO INWOOD PARK

11:22.449 --> 11:24.818
AND LET HANK ROBERTS' KID
BEAT HIM DOWN!

11:24.852 --> 11:26.219
- I WASN'T EVEN UP THERE
THAT NIGHT.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.088
- YEAH? THEN WHY DOES
THE TRIP SHEET ON YOUR CAR

11:28.121 --> 11:30.123
SHOW 19 MILES UNACCOUNTED FOR
ON THE METER?

11:30.157 --> 11:32.059
- I-I TOOK A FARE
OUT TO BROOKLYN.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.894
I GUESS I FORGOT
TO TURN IT ON.

11:33.927 --> 11:34.928
- YOU CAN'T EVEN LIE
LIKE A REAL MAN.

11:34.962 --> 11:35.863
- ETHAN WAS MY BROTHER'S KID.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.131
I WOULD NEVER LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HIM.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.868
- YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A PIMP THAT
MADE A COUPLE OF LOUSY BUCKS

11:40.901 --> 11:42.435
WATCHING YOUR OWN NEPHEW
GET BEAT TO DEATH!

11:42.469 --> 11:43.904
- PLEASE STOP.
- SCUMBAG LIKE YOU

11:43.937 --> 11:45.138
PROBABLY BET
AGAINST YOUR OWN NEPHEW.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.440
- THAT'S AGAINST THE RULES.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.910
- WHAT RULES?

11:49.943 --> 11:52.379
- THE RULES...
OF YOUR KIDDIE FIGHT CLUB.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.947
ALL YOUR CABBIE BUDDIES

11:53.981 --> 11:56.750
GO UP TO THE PARK
WITH THEIR SONS.

11:56.784 --> 12:00.153
NICKY KICKS THEIR BUTT, AND
YOU POCKET AN EXTRA BIT OF CASH?

12:00.187 --> 12:03.123
- [scoffs]

12:03.156 --> 12:05.993
I GOT THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT, DON'T I?

12:08.028 --> 12:11.865
- DO YOU SAY THAT WHEN
THE COPS COME TO YOUR HOME?

12:11.899 --> 12:14.101
'CAUSE I GOT POLICE REPORTS.

12:14.134 --> 12:17.504
YEAH, THREE 911 CALLS
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

12:17.537 --> 12:20.340
- NEIGHBORS MADE THOSE CALLS--
NEVER BEEN ARRESTED.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.475
- NO, BECAUSE A GUY LIKE YOU
KNOWS WHERE TO PUNCH

12:22.509 --> 12:24.411
SO NO MARKS ARE LEFT,
AND YOUR WIFE--

12:24.444 --> 12:26.880
WELL, SHE'S NOT GONNA PRESS
CHARGES, IS SHE?

12:26.914 --> 12:30.017
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SANDRA'S NOT SCARED OF ME.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.451
OKAY?
WE GET ALONG GREAT--

12:31.484 --> 12:33.854
- HEY, BUFF STUD,
WHAT ARE YOU,

12:33.887 --> 12:35.555
TEN YEARS YOUNGER
THAN SANDRA?

12:35.588 --> 12:37.124
SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT
SHE HIT THE LOTTERY

12:37.157 --> 12:40.160
UNTIL YOU STARTED
SMACKING HER AROUND.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.863
STILL, SHE STICKS UP
FOR YOU...

12:42.896 --> 12:44.898
HUH, WIFE BEATER?

12:44.932 --> 12:47.935
- YOU GOT A BIG MOUTH.
- YEAH, TOUGH GUY?

12:50.170 --> 12:52.272
'CAUSE I KNOW
YOU BEAT UP NICKY, DON'T YOU?

12:52.305 --> 12:54.407
UNLESS YOU'RE WATCHING
SOMEONE ELSE BEAT HIM UP.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.243
- I LOVE MY SON.
- IS THAT WHY

12:56.276 --> 12:59.179
YOU WHORE HIM OUT
AS A PUNCHING BAG?

12:59.212 --> 13:01.081
COME ON.
OH, LOOK AT YOU.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.183
HUH? COME ON, TELL ME.
WHAT KIND OF MAN DOES THAT?

13:03.216 --> 13:05.886
- YOU SHOULD TAKE OFF THAT GUN,
AND I'LL SHOW YOU.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.488
- I'M NOT WEARING MY GUN.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.090
- DETECTIVE STABLER.
- OH, LOOK AT THAT.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.192
- DADDY'S COMING IN
TO SAVE YOUR ASS!

13:12.225 --> 13:14.962
- THE ASS I'M SAVING IS YOURS.
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.097
- REALLY?
YOU'RE JUST GONNA TUNE HIM UP

13:17.130 --> 13:18.431
WHEN I'M STANDING RIGHT THERE?

13:18.465 --> 13:19.432
- YOU'RE FREE TO LEAVE
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.034
- OH, IS THAT HOW YOU DO IT?

13:21.068 --> 13:22.435
YOU JUST BAIT 'EM
AND THEN CHOKE 'EM OUT?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.371
- I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
CUT THIS GUY OFF THE HOOK.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.538
- HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

13:25.572 --> 13:27.040
- HANK DIDN'T TELL ME

13:27.074 --> 13:29.542
HIS KID WAS OLDER
AND BIGGER THAN ETHAN.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.582
NICKY WENT AFTER MY NEPHEW.

13:35.615 --> 13:39.052
I TRIED TO STOP THE FIGHT.

13:39.086 --> 13:42.389
HANK HELD ME BACK.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.993
BY THE TIME I BROKE FREE...

13:46.026 --> 13:49.930
ETHAN WAS ON THE GROUND.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.933
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR HIM
TO GET HURT.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.106
- ARREST HIM FOR CRIMINALLY
NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE

13:59.139 --> 14:01.074
FOR ETHAN'S DEATH.
- AND WHAT ABOUT HANK?

14:01.108 --> 14:03.076
- WE CAN'T CHARGE HIM
SOLELY ON THE SAY-SO

14:03.110 --> 14:04.477
OF A CO-CONSPIRATOR.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.246
FIND ANOTHER WITNESS
WHO SAW THE FIGHT THAT NIGHT,

14:06.279 --> 14:08.381
OR LET HIM GO.
- YOU MIGHT AS WELL

14:08.415 --> 14:11.351
GIVE HIM A LICENSE TO BEAT UP
HIS WIFE AND STEPSON.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.998
- COME ON, BABY,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.399
- NICKY.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.268
HEY.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.370
- I TOLD YOU,
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.373
- NICE MEETING YOU.
I HOPE I DON'T SEE YOU AGAIN.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.109
- DON'T WORRY.
YOU WON'T.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.285
- I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT ONCE.

14:45.318 --> 14:48.188
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.
- I'M GOING HOME, CAPTAIN.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.659
[school bell rings]

15:35.302 --> 15:36.269
- NICKY.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.305
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.007
I JUST WANT TO TALK
TO YOU A MINUTE.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.341
- AH!

15:41.374 --> 15:43.276
- WHAT HAPPENED?

15:43.310 --> 15:45.512
- I FELL LAST NIGHT.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.349
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.084
- JUST--JUST PLEASE
LEAVE ME ALONE.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.220
- NICKY, LOOK...

15:53.253 --> 15:56.356
YOU CAN'T LET HANK
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.591
SOMETIMES WORDS CAN DO
A HELL OF A LOT MORE

15:58.625 --> 16:01.094
THAN ANY PUNCH.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.464
YOU'VE GOT THE POWER
TO STOP THIS.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.366
JUST TALK TO ME.
TELL ME.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.641
- HE PUNCHED ME IN MY CHEST

16:14.674 --> 16:17.010
WHEN HE FOUND
YOUR BUSINESS CARD.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.187
- OKAY. OKAY.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.688
COME ON.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.457
COME ON.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.330
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.499
STAY HERE.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.770
- HEY, HEY!
THERE HE IS!

16:43.803 --> 16:45.338
THAT'S THE GUY.
ARREST HIM.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.374
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

16:47.407 --> 16:48.741
- STABLER, YOU SAVED ME
THE TRIP.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.810
- NICKY, GET OUT OF THE CAR.

16:50.843 --> 16:54.247
I SAW HIM!
HE BEAT MY HUSBAND!

16:56.383 --> 16:57.484
- SHE'S A LIAR.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.486
- FUNNY, I BELIEVE THEM.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.503
- YOU REALLY THINK
I'M STUPID ENOUGH

17:16.536 --> 17:18.105
TO BEAT UP A GUY
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT

17:18.138 --> 17:18.938
IN FRONT OF HIS OWN HOME?

17:18.971 --> 17:20.540
- YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO ANSWER THAT?

17:20.573 --> 17:24.111
- I DIDN'T LAY A FINGER
ON HANK ROBERTS.

17:24.144 --> 17:27.180
- THE CAPTAIN SAYS HE SAW YOU
SLAM THE GUY INTO A WALL.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.615
- YOUR COP'S GOT A SHORT FUSE.

17:28.648 --> 17:32.185
I--YOU SAW WHAT HE DID
TO ME YESTERDAY.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.622
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.190
- WELL, NICKY LEFT FOR SCHOOL,

17:37.224 --> 17:39.726
AND I-I WATCHED HIM WALK
DOWN THE STREET, AS USUAL,

17:39.759 --> 17:42.162
AND, UH, STARTED
BACK TO THE HOUSE.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.864
AND THAT'S WHEN THAT BASTARD
CAME UP FROM BEHIND ME.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.235
- AND YOU'RE SURE
IT WAS DETECTIVE STABLER.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.502
- WELL, HE THREW ME
DOWN TO THE GROUND.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.472
I LOOKED UP.
IT WAS HIM.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.541
- YOUR PARTNER SAID
HE WAS GONNA TEACH HANK A LESSON

17:54.574 --> 17:55.775
FOR DISRESPECTING HIM,

17:55.808 --> 17:57.410
AND THEN HE KICKED HIM
IN THE FACE.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.211
- AND YOU SAW THIS?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.113
- I WAS STANDING
AT THE FRONT DOOR.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.614
WHAT--I DON'T GOT EYES?

18:01.648 --> 18:03.483
- WERE THERE
ANY OTHER NEIGHBORS OUTSIDE?

18:03.516 --> 18:05.718
- OH, HOW THE HELL
DO I KNOW?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.887
I WANT TO SEE MY SON.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.624
- SO YOU'RE STICKING
TO THAT STORY.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.261
- WHAT I TOLD YOU
IS HOW IT WENT DOWN.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.895
- THIS IS ABOUT REVENGE

18:15.928 --> 18:18.198
BECAUSE I BROKE UP
HIS BOYS' FIGHT CLUB.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.300
AND THEN HE BRINGS IN
HIS BATTERED WIFE

18:20.333 --> 18:22.135
TO BACK UP HIS LIE.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.736
- I ASKED WHERE YOU WERE
THIS MORNING.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.505
- PICKING UP HIS STEPSON,

18:25.538 --> 18:28.175
WHO CAN'T EVEN MOVE HIS ARM
BECAUSE HE'S IN SO MUCH PAIN.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.842
- SEEMS LIKE THIS WHOLE FAMILY
STARTS HURTING

18:29.876 --> 18:32.545
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND.
- EL, YOU BETTER COME OUT HERE.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.514
- HE'S NOT AVAILABLE,
DETECTIVE.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.349
- WHY DO YOU KEEP LYING
FOR HIM?

18:36.383 --> 18:38.185
- COME ON, GET BACK HERE.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.819
- STOP TALKING
ABOUT YOUR FATHER THIS WAY.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.521
- HE'S NOT MY FATHER.
- NICKY.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.890
NICKY, WHAT'S GOING ON.
- SHE WANTS ME TO LIE

18:43.923 --> 18:46.426
AND SAY THAT YOU HIT ME
AND THAT I SAW YOU HIT HIM.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.295
- NOT ANOTHER WORD, NICKY.
- NICKY, STOP THIS.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.930
WITHOUT HANK, WE WERE GONNA BE
OUT ON THE STREET.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.266
- MA, BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT THE OTHER GUYS TOO.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.503
I MEAN, AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T
BEAT YOU UP LIKE HANK DOES.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.541
- WHAT? I LOOK LIKE
SOMEONE PUNCHED ME?

19:02.875 --> 19:05.312
- WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE, MOM?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.914
DETECTIVE STABLER
DIDN'T DO THIS TO ME.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.882
HANK DID...

19:09.916 --> 19:13.386
MY LOVING POP.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.290
- BABY, PLEASE,
TELL ME THIS ISN'T TRUE.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.327
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.461
TELL 'EM, NICKY.
- NICKY SAID

19:21.494 --> 19:23.463
THAT YOU HIT HIM LAST NIGHT.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.464
- AND HE MADE MOM HIT HIM

19:24.497 --> 19:26.699
AND SAY THAT YOU DID IT
TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.341
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR ASSAULTING YOUR STEPSON.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.276
- HOW'S THAT FEEL, POP?
- TAKE A LAST LOOK.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.710
HE'S NO LONGER
YOUR MEAL TICKET.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.280
- GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.983
- I NEVER TOLD MY MOM
ABOUT THE FIGHTING.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.319
SHE WORKS A LOT OF HOURS,
AND I DON'T WANT HER TO WORRY.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.987
- MM-HMM.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.691
SO WHEN DID HANK
FIRST GET YOU TO FIGHT?

19:51.724 --> 19:53.693
- LAST YEAR.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.296
PICKED ME UP AT SCHOOL AND SAID
WE WERE GOING FOR A RIDE.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.598
- TO THE PARK?

19:58.631 --> 20:00.900
- THE OTHER KID WAS ALREADY
THERE WITH HIS DAD.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.570
THEY JUST...

20:03.603 --> 20:06.306
TOLD US TO GET OUT ON THE GRASS
AND START FIGHTING.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.708
- NO RULES?

20:08.741 --> 20:10.209
- NO.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.947
- HOW'D YOU DO?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.516
- KNOCKED HIM OUT.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.386
AND THEN--AND THEN
I THOUGHT I KILLED HIM

20:19.419 --> 20:22.755
UNTIL HE MOVED.

20:22.789 --> 20:27.260
AND THEN POP WAS SMILING AND--
AND SAID HE WAS PROUD OF ME.

20:27.294 --> 20:30.563
- WHAT HAPPENED
IF YOU DIDN'T WIN?

20:33.366 --> 20:35.702
- WHEN I LOSE, POP SAYS
THAT IT'S MY FAULT

20:35.735 --> 20:37.570
THAT WE CAN'T PAY OUR BILLS.

20:37.604 --> 20:41.574
THEN HE HITS ME.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.811
AND ONE TIME...

20:44.844 --> 20:48.315
SOME KID MESSED UP MY SHOULDER,
AND I LOST.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.550
AND WHEN WE GOT HOME,

20:50.583 --> 20:53.019
POP KEPT PUNCHING ME
IN THAT SAME SHOULDER

20:53.052 --> 20:55.322
OVER AND OVER.

20:57.324 --> 21:00.493
- [sighs] OKAY.

21:00.527 --> 21:03.696
WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.736
ETHAN GILBERT.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.873
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:17.944 --> 21:20.980
- [voice breaking]
HE WAS JUST A LITTLE KID.

21:21.013 --> 21:24.083
I-I TOLD HANK
THAT IT WASN'T FAIR.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.887
I TOLD HIM.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.324
HE SHOVED ME OUT THERE
AND SAID, "BE A MAN."

21:31.358 --> 21:34.627
SO...

21:34.661 --> 21:38.731
I PUNCHED ETHAN REAL LIGHT
AT FIRST.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.868
HE WENT DOWN
BUT GOT BACK UP.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.504
AND POP SAID THAT
IF I DIDN'T KNOCK THE KID OUT

21:44.537 --> 21:48.375
THAT I'D GET IT EVEN WORSE.

21:48.408 --> 21:51.411
SO I HIT HIM
A LITTLE HARDER,

21:51.444 --> 21:53.546
AND HE GOT BACK UP SLOWER.

21:55.415 --> 21:59.018
AND THEN POP STARTED TO CHEER,
"BREAK HIS NOSE.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.721
GET HIM IN THE EYE."

22:03.523 --> 22:06.826
I MEAN, THE POOR KID
STARTED PUKING.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.729
AND POP SHOUTED,
"KNOCK HIM OUT!"

22:09.762 --> 22:11.931
SO I STARTED POUNDING HIM.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.870
I STARTED POUNDING HIM,
AND IT FELT GOOD,

22:17.904 --> 22:20.573
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHY.

22:20.607 --> 22:23.910
AND I COULDN'T STOP IT.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.846
AND THEN HE WENT DOWN.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.751
HE DIDN'T GET UP.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.427
I'M SORRY.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.066
[sniffles]

22:47.099 --> 22:50.069
[crying]
I'M REALLY SORRY THAT HE DIED.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.604
- I KNOW.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.840
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.885
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO NICKY'S REAL DAD?

23:05.918 --> 23:08.421
- [sniffling]

23:08.455 --> 23:10.890
HE TOOK OFF
WHEN NICKY WAS TWO.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.727
- DID YOU KNOW
HANK WAS ABUSING NICKY?

23:14.761 --> 23:17.530
- HE ALWAYS SAYS HE'S SORRY.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.899
- UNTIL HE HITS HIM AGAIN...

23:19.932 --> 23:21.568
AND YOU.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.738
- HANK GOT LAID OFF

23:25.772 --> 23:27.874
FROM HIS CONSTRUCTION JOB
TWO YEARS AGO,

23:27.907 --> 23:30.943
AND ALL HE COULD FIND
WAS DRIVING A CAB.

23:30.977 --> 23:33.446
AND HE HATES IT SO MUCH.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.081
I FEEL HORRIBLE FOR HIM.

23:35.114 --> 23:38.117
- IT DOESN'T GIVE HIM
THE RIGHT TO BEAT YOU

23:38.150 --> 23:39.986
OR YOUR SON.

23:41.688 --> 23:45.525
- HANK'S A GOOD MAN DEEP DOWN.

23:45.558 --> 23:49.195
HE--HE LEGALLY ADOPTED NICKY
BECAUSE HE LOVES HIM SO MUCH.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.133
AND I KNOW HE LOVES ME,

23:54.166 --> 23:56.002
'CAUSE HE TELLS ME
ALL THE TIME.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.705
- THEY ALL SAY THAT,
EVERY LAST ONE OF 'EM.

23:58.738 --> 24:01.040
YOU PRESS CHARGES AGAINST HANK,

24:01.073 --> 24:04.877
AND WE WILL GET HIM
OUT OF YOUR LIFE AND NICKY'S.

24:04.911 --> 24:08.147
- I AM HAVING HIS BABY.
I NEED HIM!

24:08.180 --> 24:11.918
- YOU NEED TO GET RID OF HIM
BEFORE HE KILLS ONE OF YOU.

24:11.951 --> 24:16.556
- I ALREADY LOST ONE FAMILY
WHEN NICKY'S FATHER LEFT.

24:16.589 --> 24:19.759
I'M NOT GONNA BREAK UP
THIS FAMILY TOO.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.033
- DOCKET ENDING 419,

24:27.066 --> 24:29.502
PEOPLE VERSUS
HENRY SHAW ROBERTS--

24:29.536 --> 24:31.738
ONE COUNT EACH,
ASSAULT IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

24:31.771 --> 24:33.773
CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE,

24:33.806 --> 24:35.742
ENDANGERING
THE WELFARE OF A CHILD.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.710
- BUSY MAN, MR. ROBERTS.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.111
HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

24:39.145 --> 24:41.147
- NOT GUILTY.
- ON ALL COUNTS, YOUR HONOR.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.115
AND THE HOMICIDE CHARGE
IS A STRETCH.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.084
- THE DEFENDANT FORCED
HIS STEPSON

24:45.117 --> 24:47.186
TO FIGHT A TEN-YEAR-OLD
AND BET ON THE WINNER.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.988
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL
THE DEATH OF THAT CHILD?

24:49.021 --> 24:51.190
- I'LL LET
THE GRAND JURY DECIDE.

24:51.223 --> 24:54.026
BAIL, MS. HARDWICKE?
- REMAND, YOUR HONOR.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.562
WHEN HE'S NOT PROMOTING
KIDDIE FIGHTS,

24:55.595 --> 24:56.996
THE DEFENDANT
SPENDS HIS SPARE TIME

24:57.029 --> 24:58.831
BEATING UP HIS WIFE
AND STEPSON.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.800
- MY CLIENT
HAS NEVER BEEN ARRESTED,

25:00.833 --> 25:03.836
HAS A STEADY JOB AND STRONG TIES
TO THE COMMUNITY.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.972
- FIRST OFFENSE,
MS. HARDWICKE.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.174
CAN YOU LIVE WITH $50,000 BAIL?
- IF IT'S CASH ONLY

25:08.207 --> 25:10.643
AND COMES WITH AN ORDER
OF PROTECTION FOR MRS. ROBERTS.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.278
- SO ORDERED.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.781
MR. ROBERTS, YOU ARE NOT TO COME
WITHIN 200 FEET OF YOUR WIFE,

25:14.814 --> 25:17.049
YOUR STEPSON, OR YOUR HOME.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.552
- THEN WHERE THE HELL
AM I GONNA STAY?

25:19.586 --> 25:21.621
- RIKERS ISLAND
IF YOU VIOLATE THE ORDER,

25:21.654 --> 25:23.823
UNLESS YOU'D RATHER GO NOW.
- THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.759
MR. ROBERTS WILL ABIDE
BY YOUR RULING.

25:26.793 --> 25:29.028
- THEN WE'RE DONE,
AREN'T WE?

25:29.061 --> 25:31.731
TEN-MINUTE RECESS.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.902
- WE'LL GET THE MONEY
TOGETHER, BABY.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.804
- IT'S OKAY.
NO BROAD IN A BLACK ROBE

25:37.837 --> 25:39.572
IS GONNA KEEP ME
FROM WHAT'S MINE.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.007
- IF SHE DOESN'T, I WILL.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.178
- WE DON'T NEED
A RESTRAINING ORDER.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.047
- LADY, HE JUST THREATENED YOU
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.949
- HANK WOULD NEVER HURT US.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.217
- WELL, I'M GONNA
DRIVE YOU HOME.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.752
I'M GONNA HAVE A PATROL CAR

25:52.785 --> 25:55.054
SIT OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE ALL NIGHT
JUST IN CASE.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.092
- HOW'D IT GO?

26:00.126 --> 26:02.061
- SANDRA'S THE QUEEN OF DENIAL,

26:02.094 --> 26:04.731
AND HANK IS A HAND GRENADE
WITH A LOOSE PIN.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.298
- IF CRAGEN
HADN'T STEPPED IN YESTERDAY,

26:06.332 --> 26:07.299
HE WOULD HAVE BLOWN--

26:07.333 --> 26:09.268
TOO BAD.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.804
- I GOT A SON TOO, REMEMBER?

26:11.838 --> 26:13.906
- I HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY PLANS.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.274
- YEAH?
YOU BUYING US DRINKS?

26:15.307 --> 26:17.076
- TWO-FOUR IS SHORT-HANDED.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.978
C.O. IS PULLING THE RADIO CAR
OFF THE ROBERTS' PLACE

26:19.011 --> 26:20.279
AS SOON AS WE GET THERE.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.214
- CAPTAIN, I'LL GO WITH ELLIOT.
- NO, I'LL GO.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.251
IF HANK SHOWS, HE'S NOT
SETTING ANYONE UP THIS TIME.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.993
AH, SO MUCH FOR PATROL
WAITING AROUND.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.828
- [sighs]
OKAY, I'M GONNA CHECK,

26:35.862 --> 26:37.396
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.098
[gunshot]

26:39.131 --> 26:42.769
- 10-10, SHOTS FIRED,
502 WEST 139--

26:42.802 --> 26:44.737
SEND BACKUP AND A BUS.

26:47.707 --> 26:51.077
- NICKY?
SANDRA?

27:06.025 --> 27:07.259
- POLICE!

27:07.293 --> 27:08.795
NICKY?

27:08.828 --> 27:12.064
- [moaning]

27:12.098 --> 27:14.066
- SHE'S ALIVE.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.238
- NICKY.

27:19.271 --> 27:22.374
NICKY, DROP THE GUN.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.144
IT'S OKAY.
DROP THE GUN.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.190
[gun thuds]

27:42.261 --> 27:44.897
- MOM LET HIM IN...

27:44.931 --> 27:47.399
AND HE STARTED
BEATING HER UP.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.707
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.053
- I'M SORRY I LET HIM
DO THIS TO YOU.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.354
- IS MY BABY OKAY?

28:08.387 --> 28:10.857
CAN--CAN YOU CHECK TO SEE
IF HE'S MOVING?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.792
- WE HEARD A HEARTBEAT.
- I LOVE YOU, MOM.

28:26.272 --> 28:30.009
- YOU OKAY?
- I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.443
HE DESERVED TO DIE
AFTER WHAT HE DID TO MOM.

28:31.477 --> 28:32.845
- NICKY, DON'T SAY
ANYTHING ELSE.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.180
- I DON'T CARE.
- NICKY.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.216
- I PUT THE GUN TO HIS HEAD--
- STOP! STOP IT.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.051
[indistinct conversation]

28:44.190 --> 28:46.292
UNLESS YOU HAVE
A LAWYER WITH YOU

28:46.325 --> 28:47.927
AND HE SAYS IT'S OKAY,

28:47.960 --> 28:49.962
YOU CANNOT TALK
ABOUT THIS TO ANYONE.

28:49.996 --> 28:52.131
ME INCLUDED.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

28:52.164 --> 28:54.500
- I UNDERSTAND.
- OKAY. GOOD.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.769
OFFICER SMITH...

28:56.803 --> 28:58.470
TAKE THIS YOUNG MAN
DOWN TO THE PRECINCT.

28:58.504 --> 29:01.373
I'LL BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.075
- IT'S PRETTY CUT AND DRY.

29:03.109 --> 29:04.443
THE VICTIM, MR. ROBERTS,

29:04.476 --> 29:06.245
SUSTAINED AN EXIT WOUND
TO THE FOREHEAD.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.881
STIPPLING INDICATES HE WAS
SHOT IN THE BACK OF THE NECK

29:08.915 --> 29:10.216
AT POINT-BLANK RANGE.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.918
I'M RULING IT A HOMICIDE.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.152
- AND WE'RE THINKING
IT WAS JUSTIFIABLE?

29:13.185 --> 29:16.522
- WELL, NICKY SAW HANK BEATING
THE CRAP OUT OF HIS MOTHER.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.324
HE GOT HANK'S GUN

29:18.357 --> 29:19.859
AND MADE SURE THE SON OF A BITCH
DIDN'T KILL HER.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.861
- BUT NOT NECESSARILY
IN THAT ORDER.

29:21.894 --> 29:25.231
- YOU FIND SOMETHING
TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE?

29:25.264 --> 29:27.766
- IN THE BASEMENT.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.805
THE SLUG THAT KILLED
HANK ROBERTS

29:32.839 --> 29:34.907
WAS LODGED IN THE FLOOR
OF THIS CABINET.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.909
- SO HANK'S STANDING THERE,
NICKY SHOOTS.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.510
THE BULLET GOES THROUGH HANK
AND THE DOOR.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.047
- UH, ONLY IF NICKY
WERE THE JOLLY GREEN GIANT.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.089
- TRAJECTORY
IS ALMOST STRAIGHT DOWN.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.259
- AND NICKY'S ABOUT
FIVE INCHES SHORTER THAN HANK.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.161
IF HANK WERE STANDING,

29:55.194 --> 29:57.429
NICKY WOULD HAVE
TO RAISE HIS ARM

29:57.463 --> 29:59.431
AND FIRE DOWNWARDS.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.536
- HANK WAS KNEELING.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.106
- NICKY SHOT THIS GUY
EXECUTION-STYLE.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.041
- OR HANK WAS ALREADY
DOWN THERE,

30:09.075 --> 30:11.010
GETTING SOMETHING
FROM THE CABINET...

30:11.043 --> 30:13.345
LIKE THIS MAYBE.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.314
- WAS ANYTHING ELSE IN THERE,
LIKE A WEAPON?

30:15.347 --> 30:17.249
- MM-MM.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.553
- THEN THERE WAS NO IMMINENT
THREAT TO NICKY'S LIFE.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.356
- DID YOU SEE
HIS MOTHER'S FACE?

30:24.390 --> 30:26.292
- WITH THIS FAMILY,
LET'S SEE WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY

30:26.325 --> 30:28.460
BEFORE WE JUMP
TO ANY CONCLUSIONS.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.263
- HANK SHOWED UP
AT MY BACK DOOR, PLEADING.

30:31.297 --> 30:35.034
I-I COULDN'T JUST LEAVE HIM
OUT IN THE COLD.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.569
BUT ONCE I LET HIM IN,
HE STARTED SLUGGING ME,

30:37.603 --> 30:40.039
SAYING I WAS A NO-GOOD SLUT.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.975
- WHERE WAS NICKY?

30:43.009 --> 30:46.045
- HE CAME RUNNING AS SOON
AS I STARTED SCREAMING.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.580
AND THEN HANK
THREW HIM TO THE FLOOR

30:48.614 --> 30:51.517
AND JUST KEPT...
KICKING ME.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.387
THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER.

30:55.421 --> 30:58.157
- OKAY, SO YOU DIDN'T SEE
NICKY SHOOT HANK.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.461
- NO. WHY?

31:02.494 --> 31:04.897
- THE EVIDENCE
DOESN'T SUGGEST SELF-DEFENSE.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.368
- YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DON'T BELIEVE NICKY?

31:09.401 --> 31:11.037
- WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.676
- HANK ONLY GOT CLOSE
TO MY HOUSE

31:17.709 --> 31:19.411
BECAUSE YOUR COPS TOOK OFF,

31:19.445 --> 31:21.180
AND YOU ACCUSE MY BOY
OF LYING?

31:21.213 --> 31:22.915
- MRS. ROBERTS--

31:22.949 --> 31:25.417
- AND DON'T YOU GO
ANYWHERE NEAR MY SON.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.393
- NICE BEDSIDE MANNER.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.262
- I WANT THE TRUTH.

31:36.295 --> 31:37.964
LOOK, AFTER HANK WENT BY
IN A BODY BAG,

31:37.997 --> 31:39.498
NICKY SAID SOMETHING TO YOU.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.968
- THIS ISN'T
ABOUT WHAT NICKY SAID.

31:42.001 --> 31:45.204
THIS IS ABOUT HANK VIOLATING
THE PROTECTION ORDER.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.139
- HANK WASN'T THREATENING
ANYONE ON HIS KNEES

31:47.173 --> 31:49.275
WHEN NICKY SNUCK UP BEHIND HIM
AND BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.310
- HANK WAS ABUSING HIM.
SANDRA LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.512
THE BOY SNAPPED.
- NICKY'S 13.

31:53.545 --> 31:56.082
THE LAW SAYS I CAN CHARGE
THE BOY AS AN ADULT.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.984
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
PARADE HIM INTO COURT,

31:58.017 --> 31:59.318
WIN YOUR BROWNIE POINTS
WITH THE D.A.?

31:59.351 --> 32:01.988
- JUST DO YOUR JOB.

32:02.021 --> 32:04.223
ARREST NICKY
FOR SECOND-DEGREE MURDER.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.492
- DO IT YOURSELF.

32:13.399 --> 32:16.035
- I SPEND ALL DAY IN COURT,

32:16.068 --> 32:18.237
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
PISSING OFF LAWYERS.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.006
- SO HARDWICKE CALLED YOU.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.640
- SHE THINKS YOU'RE HOLDING
SOMETHING BACK.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.009
- MM-HMM.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.011
- THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT HAVE TOLD ME.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.146
I TOLD HER TO SHOVE IT.

32:27.179 --> 32:30.316
- SHE WANTS TO CHARGE NICKY
WITH MURDER TWO.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.251
- IS SHE WRONG?

32:32.284 --> 32:35.421
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:35.454 --> 32:39.691
HE SAID SOME THINGS TO ME
LAST NIGHT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.161
HE'S GLAD HANK'S DEAD.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.595
- IT'S PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME

32:43.629 --> 32:45.764
HE'S FELT SAFE IN YEARS.
- SAFE?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.333
IF HARDWICKE HAS HER WAY,

32:47.366 --> 32:50.702
THE KID'LL BE LOOKING
AT 25 TO LIFE.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.704
- ELLIOT, YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

32:54.573 --> 32:57.576
- TELL THAT TO ME TOMORROW.

32:57.609 --> 33:00.512
I DON'T WANT TO ARREST NICKY.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.248
- SO FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.

33:04.783 --> 33:08.154
- I AM NOT CHANGING MY MIND.
NICKY IS NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU.

33:08.187 --> 33:09.588
- HE'S A MINOR.
YOU NEED TO BE PRESENT

33:09.621 --> 33:11.157
WHEN I READ HIM
HIS MIRANDA RIGHTS.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.459
- MOM!

33:13.492 --> 33:15.627
- NICHOLAS ROBERTS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

33:15.661 --> 33:17.196
FOR MURDER
IN THE SECOND DEGREE.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.198
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.367
IF YOU GIVE UP THAT RIGHT--
- NO, HE'S NOT.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.634
SORRY I'M LATE.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.037
- WHO ARE YOU?

33:25.071 --> 33:26.038
- DEBBY MARSH.

33:26.072 --> 33:29.408
DETECTIVE STABLER SAYS
THAT YOU NEED A LAWYER.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.810
- OH, W-WELL,
I CAN'T AFFORD YOU.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.745
- THIS IS ON THE HOUSE.
[chuckles]

33:33.779 --> 33:35.714
PROUD OF YOURSELF, HMM,
CHARGING A BATTERED KID

33:35.747 --> 33:38.184
WITH MURDER TWO?

33:38.217 --> 33:39.518
- I'M MORE THAN OPEN
TO A DEAL.

33:39.551 --> 33:42.054
- OH. [chuckles]
WELL, I'M NOT.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.655
NO, NICKY SHOT HIS STEPFATHER
IN SELF-DEFENSE

33:43.689 --> 33:45.824
AFTER YEARS OF ABUSE.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.294
WHEN THEY HEAR WHAT
THAT BASTARD HANK ROBERTS DID,

33:48.327 --> 33:51.029
NO JURY IS EVER GOING
TO CONVICT HIM.

33:52.864 --> 33:56.435
CAN YOU DESCRIBE
NICKY'S STATE OF MIND

33:56.468 --> 33:59.071
WHEN YOU FOUND HIM
THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING?

33:59.105 --> 34:01.340
- HE WAS SCARED TO DEATH.

34:01.373 --> 34:05.111
HE WAS COWERING IN THE CORNER
OF HIS BASEMENT.

34:05.144 --> 34:09.315
THE HAND, UH, THAT WAS HOLDING
THE GUN WAS SHAKING.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.350
I ORDERED HIM TO DROP IT.
HE DID.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.852
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?
- YES, HE SAID

34:13.885 --> 34:15.721
THAT HIS STEPFATHER,
MR. ROBERTS,

34:15.754 --> 34:17.289
WAS, UH, BEATING UP HIS MOTHER,

34:17.323 --> 34:18.790
AND HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

34:18.824 --> 34:22.228
- WHAT DID YOU TAKE THAT
TO MEAN?

34:22.261 --> 34:26.332
- THAT NICKY HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO STOP MR. ROBERTS,

34:26.365 --> 34:28.567
WHO WAS IN VIOLATION
OF HIS ORDER OF PROTECTION,

34:28.600 --> 34:30.836
FROM ASSAULTING OR...

34:30.869 --> 34:32.238
KILLING HIS MOTHER.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.840
- AND YOU BELIEVED HIM.

34:34.873 --> 34:37.476
- THEN AND NOW, YES.
- THANK YOU, DETECTIVE.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.112
NOTHING FURTHER.

34:40.146 --> 34:43.215
- WHAT ELSE
DID NICKY SAY TO YOU

34:43.249 --> 34:45.184
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE,
AFTER THE SHOOTING?

34:45.217 --> 34:47.386
- OBJECTION--
ANYTHING MY CLIENT SAID

34:47.419 --> 34:49.688
IN RESPONSE
TO THE DETECTIVE'S QUESTIONS

34:49.721 --> 34:53.592
IS INADMISSIBLE WITHOUT A PARENT
OR LEGAL GUARDIAN PRESENT.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.594
- I WITNESSED
THAT CONVERSATION, YOUR HONOR.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.263
IF THE DEFENDANT
SAID ANYTHING INCRIMINATING,

34:57.296 --> 34:58.864
IT'S ADMISSIBLE
AS A SPONTANEOUS UTTERANCE.

34:58.897 --> 35:02.168
- HE'S A MINOR
AND HAD NOT BEEN MIRANDIZED.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.503
- OBJECTION OVERRULED.

35:04.536 --> 35:08.240
ANSWER THE QUESTION,
DETECTIVE.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.742
- UH, HE TALKED
ABOUT HIS STEPFATHER.

35:10.776 --> 35:14.713
- BE SPECIFIC,
DETECTIVE STABLER.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.786
- HE SAID,
"I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD.

35:20.819 --> 35:24.690
HE DESERVED TO DIE
FOR WHAT HE DID TO MOM."

35:24.723 --> 35:26.525
- AND THEN HE YELLED
SOMETHING AT YOU.

35:33.399 --> 35:36.235
- "I PUT THE GUN TO HIS HEAD."

35:38.470 --> 35:41.373
- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.
- YOU MAY STEP DOWN.

35:41.407 --> 35:43.509
WE WILL TAKE
A 15-MINUTE RECESS.

35:43.542 --> 35:44.543
[gavel bangs]

35:56.288 --> 35:58.724
- REALLY?
YOU'RE SMOKING.

36:00.959 --> 36:03.562
- YOU EVER STOP BEING A COP?

36:03.595 --> 36:05.564
- WELL, I WILL ONCE YOU
START BEING A MOTHER.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.299
YOU'RE ON THE STAND
IN TEN MINUTES.

36:09.435 --> 36:11.537
- I CAN'T.
I CAN'T DO IT.

36:11.570 --> 36:14.306
- YOU HAVE TO.
NICKY NEEDS YOU.

36:17.409 --> 36:19.578
- YOU KNOW THE NIGHT
THAT HANK WAS HITTING NICKY

36:19.611 --> 36:22.381
IN THE SHOULDER?

36:22.414 --> 36:25.717
I WATCHED HIM DO IT.

36:25.751 --> 36:29.821
I FELT EVERY PUNCH.

36:29.855 --> 36:33.625
I KNEW WHERE HANK HID HIS GUN,
AND I-I WANTED TO GO GET IT...

36:33.659 --> 36:35.827
BUT I DIDN'T.

36:35.861 --> 36:39.398
I DIDN'T DO A DAMN THING
TO PROTECT MY SON.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.267
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO GO
IN THERE NOW,

36:41.300 --> 36:43.502
STAND UP IN FRONT OF THAT JURY,
AND TELL THEM WHAT--

36:43.535 --> 36:44.770
THAT I WAS A BAD MOTHER?

36:44.803 --> 36:46.838
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.308
THIS IS ABOUT NICKY.
- GOD, YOU JUST THINK

36:49.341 --> 36:51.009
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT HIM, DON'T YOU?

36:51.042 --> 36:52.511
- NO, I THINK
YOU'RE A BATTERED WOMAN

36:52.544 --> 36:54.346
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE TO TURN.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.450
- HANK PAID THE BILLS.
HE FIXED THE HOUSE.

36:58.484 --> 36:59.851
HE PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE.

36:59.885 --> 37:02.988
HE KEPT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

37:03.021 --> 37:05.824
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITHOUT HIM NOW?

37:05.857 --> 37:08.594
- WELL, NOW YOU'RE IN CONTROL.

37:08.627 --> 37:11.763
YOU HAVE TO PROTECT NICKY.

37:11.797 --> 37:15.233
THIS MAY BE
YOUR LAST CHANCE.

37:21.039 --> 37:23.875
- HANK SAID
I WASN'T BEING LOYAL,

37:23.909 --> 37:27.613
THAT HE WAS GONNA MAKE ME PAY
FOR RATTING HIM OUT TO THE COPS.

37:27.646 --> 37:30.015
- WHEN WAS THIS,
MRS. ROBERTS?

37:30.048 --> 37:33.985
- WHEN HE WAS BEATING ME
IN THE KITCHEN.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.388
- TELL THE JURY
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.265
MRS. ROBERTS?

37:49.801 --> 37:52.037
- I GOT SOMETHING
I WA--I WANT TO SAY.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.973
- ANSWER THE QUESTION,
MS. ROBERTS.

37:55.006 --> 37:58.444
- I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU WOULD GO AFTER NICKY.

37:58.477 --> 38:02.581
I CAN'T LET HIM GO TO PRISON
FOR SOMETHING THAT I DID.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.885
IT WAS ME.
I KILLED HANK.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.488
- MOM, NO!
- MS. ROBERTS.

38:09.521 --> 38:13.625
- YOU'RE CONFESSING TO MURDER
ON THE RECORD IN OPEN COURT.

38:13.659 --> 38:14.693
I'M REMINDING YOU

38:14.726 --> 38:17.429
YOU HAVE FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

38:17.463 --> 38:19.030
- I DON'T WANT TO REMAIN SILENT!
HANK WAS BEATING ME!

38:19.064 --> 38:21.500
HE WAS GONNA KILL
THE BOTH OF US.

38:21.533 --> 38:24.970
I WENT AND FOUND
HANK'S GUN.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.938
AND WHEN HE WAS
BY THE WORKBENCH,

38:26.972 --> 38:28.874
I SNUCK UP BEHIND HIM,

38:28.907 --> 38:31.677
AND I BLEW
THE BASTARD'S BRAINS OUT.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.445
- DON'T LISTEN TO HER.
SHE'S LYING TO SAVE ME.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.780
I DID IT!
I KILLED HIM!

38:34.813 --> 38:36.014
- NO. I DID IT.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.048
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
[gavel bangs]

38:37.082 --> 38:39.017
THE COURT WILL BE IN RECESS
TILL AFTER LUNCH.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.619
- DON'T SAY ANY MORE.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.320
- MY PARADE
JUST BECAME A CIRCUS.

38:45.524 --> 38:46.958
- SANDRA ROBERTS
MURDERING HER HUSBAND

38:46.992 --> 38:48.727
IS ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.729
- NICKY FINDS HER
ABOUT TO SHOOT HANK.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.799
HE TIRES TO STOP HER,
BUT HE'S A SECOND TOO LATE.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.567
- NICKY GRABS THE GUN
FROM SANDRA

38:55.601 --> 38:57.135
WHO ENDS UP ACROSS THE ROOM.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.837
THAT'S WHY
WE NEVER SUSPECTED HER.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.706
- AND WHY WE NEVER
TESTED HER CLOTHES.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.040
TURNS OUT,
SANDRA'S TURTLENECK

39:02.073 --> 39:03.709
WAS SATURATED
WITH GUNSHOT RESIDUE

39:03.742 --> 39:05.777
AND FINE BLOOD-SPATTER
PARTICULATE.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.713
- SO NICKY DIDN'T KILL HIM.

39:07.746 --> 39:10.081
- I CAN'T TESTIFY TO THAT.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.418
- DIDN'T YOU
JUST PROVE IT TO US?

39:12.451 --> 39:14.386
- I SAID THAT SANDRA BEING
THE SHOOTER WAS PLAUSIBLE,

39:14.420 --> 39:17.088
BUT NICKY ALSO
TESTED POSITIVE FOR GSR

39:17.122 --> 39:19.124
AND HAD THE SAME PATTERN
OF BLOOD SPATTER.

39:19.157 --> 39:21.860
- OKAY, SO EITHER SANDRA
SHOT HIM,

39:21.893 --> 39:23.161
AND NICKY TRIED TO GRAB
THE GUN.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.564
- OR NICKY SNUCK UP
BEHIND HIM,

39:25.597 --> 39:27.766
PUT THE GUN TO HIS HEAD
JUST AS HE TOLD YOU,

39:27.799 --> 39:30.736
AND SANDRA TRIED TO STOP HIM.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.571
- THE ONLY THING
THE EVIDENCE PROVES

39:32.604 --> 39:35.907
IS EITHER ONE OF THEM
COULD HAVE SHOT HANK.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.944
- I'M SCREWED, AREN'T I?

39:38.977 --> 39:40.512
- NOW YOU KNOW
HOW THEY FELT.

39:44.483 --> 39:47.953
YOU BOTH LIED TO US,
YOU AND NICKY.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.955
YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO US
ALL ALONG,

39:49.988 --> 39:52.090
AS WELL AS YOUR OWN LAWYER.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.925
- THEN WHY DOESN'T SHE
HAVE TO BE HERE?

39:53.959 --> 39:56.962
- AH...

39:56.995 --> 39:58.797
[sighs]
BECAUSE NEITHER OF YOU

39:58.830 --> 40:01.467
ARE BEING CHARGED
IN HANK'S DEATH.

40:03.835 --> 40:06.838
- JUST BECAUSE WE CAN'T PROVE
WHICH ONE OF YOU ACTUALLY DID IT

40:06.872 --> 40:09.174
DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T WANT
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

40:09.207 --> 40:11.910
- ONE OF YOU
PULLED THE TRIGGER...

40:11.943 --> 40:13.779
AND ONE OF YOU TRIED
TO KNOCK THE GUN AWAY.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.917
- YOU HAVE MY WORD.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.687
NO ONE WILL PROSECUTE
EITHER OF YOU,

40:21.720 --> 40:23.121
SO JUST TELL US.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.491
WHICH ONE OF YOU SHOT HANK?

40:25.524 --> 40:27.659
- I DID.
- I DID.

40:39.237 --> 40:40.572
- YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

40:43.241 --> 40:46.444
- [chuckles relievedly]

40:56.021 --> 40:59.691
- WE'RE NEVER GONNA KNOW
WHICH ONE OF THEM DID IT.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.560
- DOES IT MATTER?

41:01.593 --> 41:01.660
