00:12.680 --> 00:14.680
[coughing]

00:21.240 --> 00:23.640
[coughs]

00:24.480 --> 00:26.320
[retches]

00:26.400 --> 00:27.800
[spits]

00:41.520 --> 00:42.600
Sydney!

00:43.160 --> 00:45.200
-[footsteps approach]
-Sydney!

00:48.800 --> 00:50.400
[whirs]

01:03.200 --> 01:05.760
[machine whirs]

01:19.080 --> 01:20.000
[gulps]

01:33.160 --> 01:37.320
[in French] Unfortunately, the tests
revealed structural alterations

01:37.400 --> 01:39.720
in the larynx of His Royal Highness...

01:40.680 --> 01:42.920
and that the disease is advanced.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.040
There is no cure,

01:47.480 --> 01:49.200
only palliative care,

01:49.560 --> 01:51.520
and once the morphine starts,

01:51.600 --> 01:55.320
His Royal Highness will be debilitated
much of the time.

01:56.680 --> 02:00.080
My advice would be to make the most
of the precious time that remains.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.800
[in English] We must throw a party.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.200
Our greatest ever party.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.880
Hmm.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.160
-[exhales]
-And concentrate only on happy things.

02:34.920 --> 02:38.120
To that end,
let's cancel the Japanese emperor.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.240
Hirohito? No, we can't do that.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.240
No, too much planning has gone into it.

02:44.200 --> 02:50.080
Besides, it may be my only remaining
opportunity to restore my reputation.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.600
Oh, reputation...

02:53.840 --> 02:57.600
is an idle and most false imposition.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.560
Oft got without merit

03:00.280 --> 03:02.520
and lost without deserving.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.120
Hmm.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.360
No, we don't want it to look like Kabuki.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.640
[chuckles]

03:31.320 --> 03:33.760
-[car approaches]
-Ah.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.480
[David] Only the second time
he's ever left his country.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.640
Last time he was only 20.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.680
A boy. I was 26.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.040
He didn't speak a word of English.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.120
I gather he has a little now.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.600
-[cameras click]
-[reporters shout]

03:53.840 --> 03:56.560
[in Japanese] They promised us no cameras.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.120
I don't want my people
to see me visit a man

04:00.520 --> 04:02.560
who could not hold on to his throne.

04:03.640 --> 04:04.680
[in English] Well...

04:05.800 --> 04:08.400
we didn't agree to this visit
for the conversation.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.720
[in French] One, two, three.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.560
-[camera clicks]
-Perfect.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.640
[continues speaking French]

04:26.280 --> 04:28.920
One, two, three.

04:29.880 --> 04:30.920
[camera clicks]

04:31.760 --> 04:37.240
[in Japanese] Imagine living in exile
from your homeland.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.320
I would sooner die.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.520
[in English] Never leaves Japan.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.000
Imagine being stuck on an island
your whole life.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.200
An island which is home.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.240
And where you reign as sovereign.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.480
I can think of worse things.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.920
[Elizabeth]
"The Emperor and the former king.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.520
Two great statesman reunited." The Times.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.560
"A Royal Reunion." The New York Times.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.200
"Fifty years of strife laid to rest in
triumphant meeting." The Guardian.

05:26.640 --> 05:30.280
I heard this morning that he's requested
to do a television interview with the BBC.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.600
What kind of interview?

05:31.680 --> 05:33.800
An in-depth retrospective.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.120
I can't bear it.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.400
Now they're rehabilitating him.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.200
It's possible, Mummy,
that not everyone is as consumed

05:40.280 --> 05:41.600
by loathing of him as you are.

05:42.560 --> 05:45.440
Charles asked my blessing
to visit him in France.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.600
Whatever for?

05:47.160 --> 05:48.880
He said out of respect.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.600
But I imagine it's curiosity, too.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.120
One doesn't often get the opportunity
to meet a former king.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.440
Former kings are usually dead.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.160
[car door opens]

07:32.600 --> 07:34.600
[overlapping chatter]

07:55.520 --> 07:57.280
[Parker Bowles] That was cutting it fine.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.480
Why the cocktail dress?
Tonight's black tie.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.800
I'm not coming.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.040
What? You can't not come.
It's the amalgamation ball.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.480
I had a clash.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.800
-With what?
-None of your business.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.920
Look, this escalation of hostilities
is neither necessary nor justifiable.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.240
You had your chance for a ceasefire,
and you broke it.

08:20.320 --> 08:24.120
If you're talking about Ginny, it's over.
The whole thing was hideous.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.520
No, hideous was knowing
you were out on maneuvers with her.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.480
So, before we even discuss
the terms of a truce,

08:31.920 --> 08:33.640
you deserve to know how it feels.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.240
[Parker Bowles] Who's that?

08:39.320 --> 08:40.560
Never you mind.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.240
[grumbles]

08:47.840 --> 08:51.040
[jazz music plays]

08:57.040 --> 08:58.480
-Evening.
-Good evening, sir.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.400
-You alone?
-Ah.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.120
Huh?

09:08.200 --> 09:10.480
Where's, uh... where's Memsahib?

09:10.560 --> 09:11.960
She had a better offer.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.240
-Really?
-Hmm.

09:14.880 --> 09:15.880
Oh.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.440
But, as it turns out... Evening.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.320
...that means I'm free to seek
a proposition of my own.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.320
Thank you.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.400
-Well, in that case...
-Yes?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.960
There's, uh...
There's someone you should meet.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.520
Come with me.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.720
[clears throat]

09:45.320 --> 09:46.640
Your Royal Highness?

09:47.040 --> 09:50.320
May I present
Captain Andrew Parker Bowles.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.840
Hello, Andrew.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.080
Your Royal Highness.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.920
What are you staring at?

10:02.520 --> 10:04.160
At you, ma'am.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.760
-And how much you've--
-Choose the next word very carefully.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.920
...flowered.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.400
Oh, you mean the dress.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.840
It's the Queen's. I look like a hydrangea.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.560
No, no. I mean, uh...

10:17.920 --> 10:19.400
...developed. [scoffs]

10:20.160 --> 10:21.160
Grown up.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.840
Evidently,
I've gone from invisible to visible.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.240
-No, you were, you were always visible.
-But somehow you'd never seen me.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.080
Now you're making up for it...

10:31.160 --> 10:32.320
...by gawping.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.480
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't apologize.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.760
I hate it when men apologize.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.440
It isn't honorable or chivalrous.
It's wet.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.920
[sighs]

10:44.000 --> 10:46.200
I didn't say I objected to it, did I?

10:47.720 --> 10:49.440
-No.
-Well, then.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.640
I don't mind admitting I've done my fair
share of gawping at you over the years.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.800
Have you?

10:56.120 --> 10:57.520
On the polo field.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.800
When I should have been watching the
Duke of Edinburgh or the Prince of Wales,

11:01.880 --> 11:04.440
my young, impressionable female eye,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.480
for some reason, was drawn to you.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.840
[Parker Bowles chuckles]

11:17.080 --> 11:18.920
[glass clinks]

11:19.440 --> 11:20.480
[exhales]

11:22.240 --> 11:24.640
-[Parker Bowles] That was fun.
-Yes, it was.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.120
That said, we should probably
make it the last time.

11:30.200 --> 11:33.040
-I don't want you to get hurt.
-What makes you think I would?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.880
Oh, it's what tends to happen to anyone
who gets in the way.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.240
Of what?

11:38.680 --> 11:39.720
Me and her.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.480
You sail, don't you?

11:43.560 --> 11:45.800
Do I need to brace myself
for a nautical metaphor?

11:46.720 --> 11:48.920
At sea, there are, um...

11:50.160 --> 11:53.560
...hidden currents. Deadly.
They can pull one under.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.080
Camilla and I are a bit like that.

12:04.880 --> 12:05.960
What are you doing?

12:06.520 --> 12:07.520
Leaving.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.800
-But I don't want you to.
-You just said you did.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.680
No I didn't.
I said I don't want you to get hurt.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.120
This conversation is going round
and round in circles.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.440
I preferred it when we were going round
and round in circles.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.080
I can see perfectly clearly who you are,

12:23.160 --> 12:26.840
and what this is and I can assure you
I'm not going to get hurt.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.360
Now, what's it going to be?

12:32.280 --> 12:34.520
A resumption or a cessation?

12:35.880 --> 12:36.880
Of what?

12:42.640 --> 12:43.720
A resumption.

12:45.840 --> 12:46.720
Fine.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.120
Where do you get it from at your age?

12:50.360 --> 12:53.320
-What?
-Oh, come on. That confidence.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.600
I'm not confident, dear.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.680
Just tough.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.160
[kisses]

13:00.800 --> 13:03.440
[commentator] Here come Windsor Park,
in the green, on the attack.

13:03.520 --> 13:07.240
Good run up the field, on a glorious day
here at the Guards Polo Club.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.240
Coming straight through,
looking confident,

13:10.320 --> 13:13.120
Prince Charles leading the charge there
with number four.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.920
Leans it forward, but there's
Parker Bowles with a tail shot,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
backs up the ball to his teammate,
and Windsor Park, on the pivot,

13:19.080 --> 13:20.240
to try and recover.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.280
[Mountbatten] Go on, Charles, go on.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.120
Blues and Royals
in the white with the red stripes

13:24.200 --> 13:26.880
on the counter-attack now
with two minutes left in this chukka.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.200
-[Camilla] Come on, sir!
-...a tussle for possession now.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.800
Go on, your Royal Highness, sir!
You can do it!

13:33.640 --> 13:37.280
Yes, it's Windsor Park!
Windsor Park pushing up once more.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.600
[man] Parker!

13:38.880 --> 13:41.840
Oh, Parker Bowles rides off
the Prince of Wales.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.520
He's ridden him off.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.800
Parker Bowles hits the big one.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.720
Windsor Park rushing back now,
they're in trouble.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.640
Parker Bowles striking ahead.
But Prince Charles is still in the race.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.240
Come on, sir! Come on!

13:57.800 --> 13:58.800
He's closing!

13:59.560 --> 14:00.440
Oh, come on.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.680
He's closing!

14:03.560 --> 14:05.000
And Parker Bowles scores!

14:05.760 --> 14:08.000
Parker Bowles for the Blues and Royals!

14:08.080 --> 14:10.480
That makes it two goals to nothing!

14:22.440 --> 14:24.840
-Bad luck out there.
-I might see you afterwards.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.560
Hmm.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.480
You played well today.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.560
You and I both know I didn't.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.400
Andrew Parker Bowles played well today.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.200
You just need a bit more aggression
in your game, that's all.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.040
So you keep telling me.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.320
[chuckles]

14:46.760 --> 14:48.200
How was Paris?

14:48.440 --> 14:50.080
And the Duke of Windsor?

14:50.160 --> 14:52.160
It was all very odd.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.720
He didn't look at all well.

14:55.040 --> 14:56.120
Hmm?

14:56.200 --> 15:00.760
And the house is like some...
bizarre monarchy museum.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.880
Reeked of joss sticks and dogs.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.160
[chuckles]

15:05.800 --> 15:09.800
Was she there?
Flapping around like a demented bat?

15:09.880 --> 15:11.720
-Yes.
-Hmm.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.000
I hear she consumes nothing but whiskey.

15:16.120 --> 15:19.560
And has had so many facelifts
she can barely speak.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.800
-Dickie...
-Oh!

15:22.960 --> 15:24.920
I don't know if I've told you, but...

15:25.640 --> 15:27.600
we've been writing to one another.

15:28.280 --> 15:31.120
I think he sees something
of himself in me.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.040
Don't tell your grandmother that.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.960
He keeps telling me to find a wife.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.760
Oh! It's far too early for that.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.880
Now is the time to sow your oats.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.280
Play the field.

15:46.880 --> 15:47.880
Perhaps.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.160
But as it happens,
there is someone I quite like.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.920
The one cheering you on today, yes?

15:58.360 --> 15:59.920
-Yes.
-Hmm.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.280
Who used to be with Andrew Parker Bowles
until they had a falling out.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.560
Over Anne.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.440
If you please.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.960
-Your sister?
-Don't ask. It's all a bit messy.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.920
But the long and the short of it is,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.200
Camilla is now free,
and I'd like to snap her up.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.280
Hmm.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.080
And that's her name?

16:20.800 --> 16:22.000
-Yes.
-Hmm.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.000
Camilla Shand.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.120
I like her.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.520
[chuckles]

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
So...

16:36.280 --> 16:37.600
Have you voted yet?

16:38.840 --> 16:39.840
[Camilla] Yes.

16:40.720 --> 16:41.640
Who for?

16:42.280 --> 16:44.080
None of your business, sir.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.200
[laughs]

16:47.080 --> 16:49.040
They say it's a formality for Wilson.

16:49.120 --> 16:52.160
Ugh! Not if I've got anything
to do with it. Ah!

16:52.640 --> 16:55.080
I've rather given things away there,
haven't I?

16:55.160 --> 16:56.480
[Charles chuckles]

16:57.520 --> 17:00.800
How am I going to be able to persuade you
to have dinner with me?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.960
-Issue a royal decree?
-I can't do that.

17:04.360 --> 17:05.520
I'm not King.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.360
Yet.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.560
Yet.

17:10.840 --> 17:12.440
Then just say please.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.760
[laughs]

17:15.920 --> 17:18.320
-Please.
-[chuckles]

17:19.040 --> 17:21.600
[man on TV] ...this early general election
has failed to pay off,

17:21.680 --> 17:23.680
then it could be
we find ourselves waking up

17:23.760 --> 17:25.840
to a different prime minister tomorrow.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.040
[door opens]

17:31.360 --> 17:32.920
The leader of the opposition,

17:33.520 --> 17:35.520
Mr. Edward Heath, Your Majesty.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.120
[door closes]

17:46.440 --> 17:47.560
Mr. Heath.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.520
The people have voted
in your party's favor.

17:50.680 --> 17:54.000
As their sovereign, I invite you
to form a government in my name.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.680
Congratulations.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.840
It really is an encouraging set
of circumstances.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.600
Labour took the British people
for granted.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.560
Mr. Wilson behaved like a petty emperor,

18:09.640 --> 18:11.760
and treated this election
like a coronation.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.080
[chuckles]

18:14.240 --> 18:16.120
Nothing wrong with a coronation.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.080
Under the right circumstances.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.000
[exhales]

18:29.880 --> 18:32.640
We then had a brief foray into small talk.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.600
He's taking a grand piano with him
to Downing Street, if you please.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.440
[scoffs]
Some bring a wife, others a grand piano.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.360
I then asked him
what his first priorities were,

18:41.440 --> 18:44.000
he said he'd like me to go to France
at the earliest opportunity.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.400
What for?

18:45.480 --> 18:47.000
To try to charm Pompidou,

18:47.200 --> 18:50.120
so he doesn't block our entry
into the European Economic Community,

18:50.200 --> 18:51.440
like his predecessor.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.080
He's passionately committed to Europe.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.680
[door opens]

18:59.520 --> 19:00.440
Your Majesty.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.160
-Your Royal Highness.
-Martin.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.400
I never see the other one anymore.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.320
-Sir?
-Where's the other one?

19:07.400 --> 19:09.840
The, um... the, the bald one.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.960
The... Oh!
Colonel Adeane. He's retired, sir.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.200
Has he?

19:15.640 --> 19:19.040
-Three months ago. You gave him a clock.
-Did I?

19:22.520 --> 19:23.400
What is it, Martin?

19:23.480 --> 19:27.560
A reminder that the BBC interview with
the Duke of Windsor is coming up soon.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.680
Now, we understand the Duke
is no longer in the best of health.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.960
Might be worth visiting
when you go to Paris.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.600
Certainly not.

19:35.680 --> 19:36.560
Go on, Martin.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.040
There's just a slight concern that
if the BBC interview were to go down well,

19:40.120 --> 19:43.240
following the successful visit
of Emperor Hirohito,

19:43.320 --> 19:45.400
the question might be asked,

19:45.640 --> 19:48.920
if the Japanese make the effort to visit,
why would his own family not?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.680
[Philip] He didn't cause them offense.

19:51.160 --> 19:55.320
He didn't abdicate the Japanese throne,
or kill the Emperor's father.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.240
For the last time, no.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.320
That man, his shame...

20:05.000 --> 20:06.480
like the stench of livestock.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.400
-Sir?
-[clears throat]

20:09.480 --> 20:12.160
It seeps into the woodwork,
and never goes away.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.840

-[Camilla] Living here.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.080
Well, not very grand, as you can see.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.240
This is the apartment
where they keep Anne and me.

22:05.240 --> 22:09.400
Two bedrooms. One small drawing room.
All very normal.

22:10.280 --> 22:12.040
Come on, none of this is normal.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.080
Not just that you live in a palace,
but the fact that you are who you are.

22:18.520 --> 22:19.800
Prince of Wales?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.320
It's not so much an existence as...

22:24.520 --> 22:25.840
a predicament.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.720
I am both free...

22:29.200 --> 22:30.280
and imprisoned.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.840
Utterly superfluous
and quite indispensable.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.480
One can never fully invest in one thing,
or another because at any moment...

22:41.560 --> 22:43.000
it could all change.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.080
And you become king.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.760
Not to mention
what it does to you as a family.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.120
How can one be a good son when...

22:54.160 --> 22:55.760
even though it's the thing you most...

22:56.280 --> 22:57.280
dread.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.000
Her dying?

23:01.320 --> 23:02.680
It's the thing you most...

23:03.400 --> 23:04.680
Not desire.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.800
Well, yes, desire.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.840
Because until she dies
I cannot be fully alive.

23:13.360 --> 23:16.440
Nor can I be the thing
for which I have been born, so...

23:18.400 --> 23:22.440
One is condemned
to this frightful business of waiting.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.880
Like Saul Bellow.

23:25.760 --> 23:28.880
Sorry, I don't know who he is.
Did he wait a lot?

23:29.280 --> 23:30.960
He's an American author.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.360
He wrote a book called Dangling Man.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.760
I sometimes feel like the main character,
whom he describes as...

23:37.280 --> 23:41.400
"Existing in a timeless,
and slightly ridiculous abyss."

23:42.280 --> 23:43.560
Was he a prince?

23:43.760 --> 23:45.160
[scoffs] No.

23:45.240 --> 23:49.360
An unemployed man from Chicago
waiting to be drafted to go to war.

23:51.400 --> 23:55.560
And he actually wants to be drafted,
because it will give his life meaning.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.360
Even though he might be killed?

24:01.400 --> 24:02.360
Yes.

the television interview
with his Royal Highness,

25:07.240 --> 25:09.000
the Duke of Windsor, is about to begin.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.400
Thank you. Thank you.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.320
[both laugh]

25:14.520 --> 25:15.920
[door closes]

25:21.000 --> 25:23.960
[presenter] You join me
in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris

25:24.040 --> 25:26.960
in this magnificent house,
once home to General de Gaulle.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.240
Its occupants today need no introduction.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.400
His Royal Highness, the Duke of Windsor,

25:33.480 --> 25:37.960
Edward VIII, King of England
for a little more than ten months.

25:38.480 --> 25:42.320
And the Duchess of Windsor,
Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson,

25:42.400 --> 25:43.600
when they met.

25:44.440 --> 25:49.720
Ma'am, when you first met the Duke,
what was your first impression?

25:51.080 --> 25:53.440
[Wallis] He struck me
as being rather "with it."

25:54.120 --> 25:55.520
Ahead of his time.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.480
Full of pep. Unlike most Englishmen.

26:01.840 --> 26:05.040
And that meeting occurred
when you were Prince of Wales?

26:05.600 --> 26:09.840
Yes. A role that
I also very much hoped to redefine.

26:09.920 --> 26:13.400
I had my own ideas, my own opinions,

26:14.040 --> 26:16.520
my own... philosophy.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.600
[presenter]
And then finally the day came.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.520
When you acceded to the throne.

26:22.600 --> 26:26.440
Yes, and much to everyone's frustration,

26:26.520 --> 26:28.400
I stayed true to myself...

26:29.400 --> 26:32.120
and the conviction
that monarchy had to change,

26:32.200 --> 26:33.680
to move with the times.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.680
Hmm.

26:35.080 --> 26:39.840
But I soon discovered that any attempt
to make even the most trifling change

26:40.400 --> 26:44.520
was met with hostility and suspicion.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.920
[presenter] By whom?

26:47.560 --> 26:49.320
By the establishment.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.280
The gray men of the court.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.960
And by my family, too.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.880
They saw me as a rebel.

26:56.760 --> 26:57.680
A threat.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.000
-Too...
-Colorful.

27:00.680 --> 27:01.720
Dynamic.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.960
Individualistic.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.640
Christ, they're ghastly.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.800
[David]
In the end, I didn't get to introduce...

27:07.880 --> 27:10.640
Both of them. Monstrous.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.520
[presenter] Because of the pressure
to stand down...

27:13.600 --> 27:15.960
-I'm going to bed.
-...to abdicate had become unbearable?

27:16.680 --> 27:17.560
[David] Yeah.

27:18.760 --> 27:21.920
People always assume
it was because of the Duchess,

27:22.360 --> 27:25.440
because of my obstinate desire to marry.

27:26.080 --> 27:29.480
But the establishment's opposition
to our marriage

27:29.560 --> 27:31.760
was really a symptom of something deeper.

27:33.120 --> 27:37.880
Their fear of the character
and freedom of thought,

27:37.960 --> 27:39.760
which I represented.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.120
[phone ring in the distance]

27:49.840 --> 27:50.760

28:03.760 --> 28:04.880

Come on.
There are no secrets in this place.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.360
Yes.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.200
And you're seeing her ex, Andrew.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.320
Not sure you can call
what we're doing "seeing."

28:29.080 --> 28:31.920
Not sure you can call him an ex, either.

28:32.320 --> 28:35.040
Camilla told me. He's definitely an ex.

28:35.960 --> 28:36.880
Hmm.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.520
Just make sure
things remain the right way round.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.320
Us playing with Camilla and Andrew.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.080
Not them playing with us.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.520
[Charteris] The plan is start in Rouen

31:21.600 --> 31:24.280
to commemorate the Allied
fallen in the Great War.

31:24.360 --> 31:28.120
Then back to Paris for a presentation
of the Diplomatic Corps.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.360
Then the all-important reception

31:30.440 --> 31:33.680
with President and Madame Pompidou
in the Élysée.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.640
Hmm.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.880
Landing in ten minutes, ma'am.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.160
[Elizabeth] It is said

32:07.240 --> 32:10.040
that those who do not learn from history

32:10.120 --> 32:13.040
will be forever condemned to repeat it.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.240
Though we have lived
through times of conflict,

32:17.320 --> 32:21.280
our two countries share
an ancient relationship.

32:22.080 --> 32:25.280
Let us not forget our deeper bonds,

32:25.680 --> 32:28.160
our sense of common purpose

32:28.440 --> 32:31.200
on which can be built a new partnership,

32:31.680 --> 32:33.240
a new entente.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.560
[cameras click]

32:34.640 --> 32:38.520
Joined together,
in this august European enterprise,

32:39.000 --> 32:41.680
a great adventure lies ahead.

32:42.840 --> 32:46.440
Monsieur le President.
L'Union fait la force.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.240
[applause]

32:48.320 --> 32:50.640
Merci. Thank you.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.640
Thank you.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.680
-Excuse me, Your Majesty?
-Excuse me.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.960
[cameras click]

33:03.040 --> 33:06.600
We've had a message concerning
His Royal Highness, the Duke of Windsor.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.280
Uh, I think we're close to the end.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.120
Thank you.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.080
[door opens]

33:34.880 --> 33:37.080
Your Royal Highness. Ma'am.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.560
Her Majesty the Queen, she's coming.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.400
-What, here?
-Yes, ma'am.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.040
She's on her way.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.320
-Get me up!
-[Wallis] You can't be serious.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.680
I-I've never been more serious.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.320
[breathes heavily]

34:21.520 --> 34:22.800
[grunts]

34:22.880 --> 34:24.680
[breathes heavily]

35:10.960 --> 35:11.880
Thank you.

35:43.920 --> 35:44.800
[door opens]

35:44.880 --> 35:46.800
Her Majesty the Queen, sir.

35:47.560 --> 35:48.840
[Elizabeth] Thank you.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.520
-[grunts]
-Oh, no. Please don't.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.480
[grunts]

36:01.880 --> 36:03.160
Your Majesty.

36:10.440 --> 36:12.040
[coughs]

36:19.600 --> 36:21.200
There was no need for that.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.400
If the roles were reversed...

36:26.240 --> 36:28.240
you would do exactly the same.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.840
[coughs]

36:30.920 --> 36:31.800
Yes.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.760
I am sorry you're not well.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.280
We've had our disagreements.

36:41.680 --> 36:44.160
But you've always remained
my favorite uncle.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.040
[coughs]

36:46.720 --> 36:48.640
It's kind of you to say

36:49.400 --> 36:51.200
and kind of you to...

36:51.520 --> 36:52.520
visit.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.080
Dear Lilibet.

36:56.360 --> 36:58.400
-"Shirley Temple."
-Ah...

36:59.400 --> 37:00.400
Yes.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.240
I underestimated you.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.880
[coughs]

37:08.960 --> 37:10.560
We all did.

37:11.920 --> 37:16.080
But the Crown always finds its way
to the right head.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.560
My father, my brother...

37:19.720 --> 37:20.560
you.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.480
And... and one day, God willing, your son.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.360
You don't think he's up to it?

37:35.800 --> 37:37.680
I never said anything of the sort.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.280
But you think it.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.640
I can read you

37:44.320 --> 37:49.120
every bit as well as you can read me...

37:50.160 --> 37:52.280
and I know why you think it.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.080
He can often appear weak.

37:55.720 --> 37:57.240
Indecisive.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.080
But with the right woman by his side,

38:02.560 --> 38:04.720
I say he'll make a good king.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.200
And his...

38:07.280 --> 38:09.000
[gurgles]

38:09.080 --> 38:13.360
...thoughts have already turned
to the matter.

38:14.240 --> 38:17.000
He writes to me, and I to him. He's...

38:17.640 --> 38:20.400
He likes this girl, Camilla.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.440
They barely know one another.

38:24.240 --> 38:25.560
Sometimes...

38:26.440 --> 38:28.520
one knows immediately.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.800
You did.

38:33.680 --> 38:34.880
What does he say?

38:36.440 --> 38:38.680
Take the letters. Read them.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.560
I can't do that.
It's a private correspondence.

38:41.640 --> 38:44.200
They concern the future of the Crown...

38:45.400 --> 38:49.320
and shed light on the soul
not only of a future king...

38:49.400 --> 38:53.160
[coughs] but also your son.

38:54.040 --> 38:57.480
Better they should be in your hands
than anybody else's.

38:59.760 --> 39:02.320
In the bureau. In the... the drawer.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.600
[coughs]

39:33.960 --> 39:35.000
And...

39:36.560 --> 39:37.720
before you go,

39:38.960 --> 39:40.320
one last time...

39:44.560 --> 39:46.000
for all of it...

39:48.560 --> 39:50.320
what I did to you...

39:54.160 --> 39:55.320
forgive me.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.200
Thank you.

40:02.440 --> 40:06.280
What you did, your abdication
of the throne, did change my life.

40:06.560 --> 40:07.440
Forever.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.280
But I want you to know

40:11.320 --> 40:13.080
it's not always a curse.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.960
And I haven't always been cross with you.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.560
That there are days...

40:22.560 --> 40:24.720
in fact, more and more the older I get...

40:26.440 --> 40:29.040
when I consider it to be a blessing.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.160
I've even on occasion found myself...

40:38.240 --> 40:39.640
wanting to thank you.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.600
[Charles] Dear Uncle David,

41:49.920 --> 41:52.160
I want to thank you again, and Wallis,

41:52.240 --> 41:54.800
for having me at your home
in the Bois de Boulogne.

41:55.560 --> 41:57.680
It's a rare thing that fate should allow

41:57.760 --> 42:00.520
a former king
and a king-in-waiting to meet.

42:01.440 --> 42:04.160
To tell the truth,
it opened my eyes to a few things.

42:06.720 --> 42:08.520
To the nature of kingship...

42:10.040 --> 42:11.320
the nature of love

42:12.680 --> 42:15.240
and all the difficulties
that go with both.

42:17.080 --> 42:20.680
I'm sure you know the family would have
preferred me not to visit you.

42:21.400 --> 42:24.160
Afraid, perhaps,
I might recognize myself in you,

42:24.640 --> 42:26.360
sympathize with you.

42:27.480 --> 42:30.920
Well, let me confess
that I do recognize myself in you.

42:32.320 --> 42:35.040
Your progressiveness and flair.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.040
Your individuality and imagination.

42:40.120 --> 42:43.040
What a king you would have made
in a kinder world.

42:43.720 --> 42:45.920
What a king we were denied.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.640
It makes me so sad
to see you living in exile,

42:52.720 --> 42:55.800
when all you did
was take a stand for principle,

42:55.880 --> 42:58.440
and love one woman completely.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.800
You were cruelly denied your right

43:01.880 --> 43:05.080
to reign alongside the woman
that you wanted by your side.

43:08.080 --> 43:08.960
[sighs]

43:09.040 --> 43:10.560
But I give you my word.

43:11.360 --> 43:14.720
I will not be denied
what you have been denied.

43:16.840 --> 43:21.720
The Crown is not a static thing
resting forever on one head.

43:22.320 --> 43:23.560
It is moving.

43:24.240 --> 43:25.320
Alive.

43:25.760 --> 43:26.920
Divine.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.720
The changing face of changing times,

43:31.800 --> 43:35.080
and if, God willing, it has been ordained
that I should wear it...

43:35.920 --> 43:38.360
then I shall do so on my own terms...

43:41.240 --> 43:44.320
and hopefully make you proud.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.280
[whimpers]

43:55.200 --> 43:56.440
[gasps]

44:05.560 --> 44:06.760
[gasps]

44:12.080 --> 44:12.960
[sniffles]

44:19.720 --> 44:20.920
[mutters]
