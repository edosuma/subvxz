00:04.059 --> 00:05.500
In the beginning...

00:05.500 --> 00:07.780
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.

00:07.780 --> 00:09.020
Oh!

00:09.020 --> 00:10.220
..there were 12.

00:11.700 --> 00:13.420
I can't believe that's
just happened to me.

00:13.420 --> 00:16.660
They're not going to allow
me into Yorkshire ever again.

00:21.860 --> 00:25.660
Now...there are three.

00:28.980 --> 00:30.780
Right, calm down now.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.620
(Good luck, guys.)

01:03.620 --> 01:04.660
Good luck, guys.

01:07.940 --> 01:10.580
'Winning Star Baker in the first week...'

01:10.580 --> 01:11.620
No!

01:11.620 --> 01:13.820
'..Jane got off to a flying start.'

01:13.820 --> 01:15.100
Absolutely beautiful, yes.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.300
Thank you.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.700
'Her home-style baking
impressed Mary and Paul.'

01:18.700 --> 01:20.180
That is first-rate.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.820
This is a complete mess.

01:21.820 --> 01:24.460
'Although timing often
wasn't on her side.'

01:24.460 --> 01:25.940
Things didn't go to plan.

01:25.940 --> 01:27.180
No, they didn't.

01:27.180 --> 01:30.300
'The garden designer dug deep
to make it to the final.'

01:30.300 --> 01:32.780
That fleur-de-lis is outstanding.

01:32.780 --> 01:34.140
Thank you.

01:34.140 --> 01:36.820
To be at the final is just amazing.

01:36.820 --> 01:38.660
It feels really unreal, actually.

01:38.660 --> 01:40.940
People say to you, "Oh, how've you been?

01:40.940 --> 01:42.620
"What's happened this week?"

01:42.620 --> 01:44.740
You go, "You know,
nothing, really, same old,"

01:44.740 --> 01:46.740
and you want to go, "I'm in the final

01:46.740 --> 01:48.300
"of The Great British Bake Off!"

01:48.300 --> 01:49.340
And you can't.

01:50.660 --> 01:53.700
Candice has won Star Baker three times.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.100
Well done.

01:55.100 --> 01:56.500
Her elaborate creations...

01:56.500 --> 01:58.100
Wow, exceptional.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.700
..went the extra mile...

01:59.700 --> 02:02.980
It's like you, isn't it? You
like to do things over the top.

02:02.980 --> 02:05.820
..and both impressed and
frustrated the judges.

02:05.820 --> 02:09.500
Rein it in a little bit. Get
your baking absolutely spot-on.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.900
But with bakes inspired by her family...

02:11.900 --> 02:14.580
- The overall effect is beautiful.
- Yes!

02:14.580 --> 02:15.900
..she's made it to the final.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.380
There's been a lot of practice this week.

02:18.380 --> 02:21.620
The other day, I did baking
for 12 hours, and I hurt a lot.

02:21.620 --> 02:24.380
I'd really like to think I'd,
like, got really fit and toned

02:24.380 --> 02:26.180
and everything from baking.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.580
Definitely haven't.

02:27.580 --> 02:30.900
Definitely struggling to
fit in clothes currently.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.940
'Aerospace engineer Andrew...

02:32.940 --> 02:34.860
Where are your schematics for this?

02:34.860 --> 02:36.740
'..has been Mr Precision.'

02:36.740 --> 02:39.300
The overall effect is
absolutely brilliant.

02:39.300 --> 02:41.460
'Despite his meticulous methods...'

02:41.460 --> 02:44.380
Guided rolling pin - gives me
uniform thickness of dough.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.060
'..when it came to Star Baker...'

02:46.060 --> 02:47.300
Well done, Tom.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.300
'..for weeks, he was the bridesmaid...'

02:49.300 --> 02:50.460
Benjamina.

02:50.460 --> 02:51.780
'..never the bride.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.220
'But dessert week onwards...'

02:53.220 --> 02:54.540
They look gorgeous.

02:54.540 --> 02:55.860
'..was a turning point.'

02:55.860 --> 02:58.060
I've never seen a mechanised pie.

02:58.060 --> 02:59.980
'At last he won Star Baker...'

02:59.980 --> 03:01.660
The presentation is stunning.

03:01.660 --> 03:03.980
'..and won it again in the semifinal.'

03:03.980 --> 03:06.020
Coming in, I really
wanted to make the final.

03:06.020 --> 03:09.020
That was my number one objective,
and then if I can win it...

03:09.020 --> 03:10.900
That seemed like a
silly dream at the time,

03:10.900 --> 03:12.700
but now that we're here,

03:12.700 --> 03:15.260
I've got to darn well try.

03:27.980 --> 03:30.580
Bakers, finalists!

03:30.580 --> 03:34.700
Welcome to the tent. And the
final this year is being given...

03:34.700 --> 03:36.380
..the royal treatment.

03:36.380 --> 03:37.820
Between the four of us,

03:37.820 --> 03:40.620
we already have a sponge sceptre
and several jellied orbs,

03:40.620 --> 03:42.580
but Mary and Paul would
like to complete the set

03:42.580 --> 03:46.340
by giving you the challenge of
making a filled meringue crown.

03:46.340 --> 03:50.180
We're not talking some little
nimby-pimby tiny crown.

03:50.180 --> 03:52.980
No, bakers, we want a family-sized crown

03:52.980 --> 03:55.660
big enough for the whole royal family.

03:55.660 --> 03:58.780
It must have three layers
of meringue, at least...

03:59.780 --> 04:01.860
..and it must be dazzlingly decorated.

04:01.860 --> 04:03.540
You've got three hours on this challenge.

04:03.540 --> 04:05.460
- On your marks...
- Get set... - Bake!

04:08.540 --> 04:10.180
Good luck.

04:10.180 --> 04:11.460
Good luck, guys.

04:13.180 --> 04:17.220
The nerves are a bit jangly.
I've dropped a bowl already.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.779
It is the final.

04:18.779 --> 04:20.339
We've been waiting for this,

04:20.339 --> 04:23.100
and I think it's quite right we go royal.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.220
After all, it is the
Queen's 90th birthday year.

04:26.220 --> 04:28.260
This is the last signature chance,

04:28.260 --> 04:29.540
so we've chosen meringue.

04:29.540 --> 04:31.540
Now, they've struggled
with meringue in the past,

04:31.540 --> 04:34.420
so I thought it was a good idea
to go back to the meringue again.

04:34.420 --> 04:35.580
We've asked for a crown.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.780
How they achieve that is up to them,

04:37.780 --> 04:39.820
but what I am looking for -

04:39.820 --> 04:43.540
it's got to taste good, look
good and be spectacular.

04:43.540 --> 04:46.260
Three tiers of meringue can be
quite sweet and overwhelming,

04:46.260 --> 04:48.300
so they've got to add a
little bit of tartness to it.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.300
That can come from the fruit -
whether it's a curd, a compote,

04:51.300 --> 04:53.540
that will balance out the
sweetness of the meringue.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.660
I haven't any idea who's going to win.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.220
It's an open field.

04:57.220 --> 04:59.700
I'm looking forward to it.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.900
Good morning, Jane.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.500
- Good morning.
- Right, tell us all about your meringue crown.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.540
My meringue crown is a red,
white and blue meringue crown

05:06.540 --> 05:08.700
with strawberry and raspberry compote,

05:08.700 --> 05:10.700
and then the next layer
is a blueberry compote,

05:10.700 --> 05:14.420
and then the top is white flesh
nectarines with other fruits.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.420
Jane's red, white and blue pavlova

05:16.420 --> 05:19.020
is her husband Ray's favourite dessert.

05:19.020 --> 05:22.260
She's hoping that sticking with her
tried and tested family favourite

05:22.260 --> 05:24.540
will be a hit with Paul and Mary.

05:24.540 --> 05:27.940
Now, you've kept it fairly
simple for the final.

05:27.940 --> 05:31.260
I have kept it simple, but I want
it to be a good pavlova at the end.

05:31.260 --> 05:33.220
Guys, simple is good, surely?

05:33.220 --> 05:34.700
Well, it comes down to perfection.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.020
When you go simple, we are
looking for the best flavours,

05:37.020 --> 05:38.900
the best look with no failure.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.180
No pressure, then!

05:42.700 --> 05:46.340
All three bakers have opted
for a pavlova-style meringue.

05:46.340 --> 05:50.020
I'm using muscovado
sugar as well as caster.

05:50.020 --> 05:52.620
It gives it a more caramelly
flavour, which I quite like,

05:52.620 --> 05:55.980
but can lead to
easier-collapsing meringues.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.740
Can tend to crack slightly,
but flavour wins, right?

06:00.100 --> 06:01.540
This is just caster sugar.

06:01.540 --> 06:05.380
I want a nice, as white
as possible, meringue.

06:05.380 --> 06:08.140
True to form for this regal signature...

06:08.140 --> 06:12.380
It needs to be just right.
Just like Goldilocks.

06:12.380 --> 06:14.140
..Candice is going a little further.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.700
I am doing two different meringues.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.100
One of them I'm adding
white caster sugar,

06:19.100 --> 06:22.340
and the other one will
have golden caster sugar.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.860
Her two different meringues will
make three tiers of pavlova,

06:25.860 --> 06:27.820
filled with Prosecco-soaked strawberries,

06:27.820 --> 06:30.260
mango curd, gold-dusted Physalis

06:30.260 --> 06:32.260
and glittered pistachios.

06:32.260 --> 06:33.740
Then there's a fourth tier,

06:33.740 --> 06:37.180
inspired by the tiny
crown of Queen Victoria.

06:37.180 --> 06:40.020
You've chosen to do quite a lot
of different things, actually.

06:40.020 --> 06:42.700
- Yep.
- You've got to do it all in the time.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.540
I have got to do it all in the time,

06:44.540 --> 06:46.380
but I think once the meringues are in,

06:46.380 --> 06:48.140
the bits in the middle I can fill.

06:48.140 --> 06:50.740
As long as they've got their
cooking time and their cooling time,

06:50.740 --> 06:51.900
so they're nice and crisp,

06:51.900 --> 06:53.420
then it's just a case of building it up.

06:53.420 --> 06:54.900
- All right, good luck.
- Thank you.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.260
I thought I'd reined it in.

06:57.260 --> 06:59.660
I didn't think I was going
complicated at all this week.

06:59.660 --> 07:03.140
I've got three main
layers, three flavours,

07:03.140 --> 07:05.540
one mini crown, a curd and some fruit.

07:07.380 --> 07:09.020
Nothing.

07:09.020 --> 07:12.020
So, I've increased the speed now
that all the sugar's been added,

07:12.020 --> 07:14.740
and then I'm looking
for really solid peaks.

07:15.780 --> 07:17.940
There's nowhere to hide if
the meringue goes wrong.

07:17.940 --> 07:20.460
There will be no time to remake.

07:20.460 --> 07:23.540
If it isn't beaten until
it's completely stiff...

07:23.540 --> 07:25.260
Still soft.

07:25.260 --> 07:28.020
..when piped, the meringue
will lose its shape...

07:30.700 --> 07:32.940
..and then collapse as it's baked.

07:32.940 --> 07:35.620
Suddenly feeling really nervous.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.900
Oh, how can meringue do this to you, eh?

07:38.980 --> 07:41.420
I'm just going freehand on my circle.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.820
Whoops!

07:48.620 --> 07:50.660
That's going to be my
meringue cross on top.

07:51.860 --> 07:55.180
The next meringue is
going to have colour.

07:56.460 --> 07:59.460
This is going to have pistachio on it.

08:04.140 --> 08:07.620
So my Queen Victoria
crown will go on here.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.300
I wanted to feature that cos I
loved that when I was younger.

08:12.060 --> 08:13.500
You do need steady hands.

08:15.620 --> 08:21.260
Just applying some gold lustre to
give it a nice vibrant royal look.

08:21.260 --> 08:23.020
Good morning, Andrew. How are you?

08:23.020 --> 08:24.700
Good morning, I'm very well, thank you.

08:24.700 --> 08:25.980
Tell us about this meringue.

08:25.980 --> 08:27.380
This is just a classic meringue

08:27.380 --> 08:30.820
and I've used a 50-50 caster
sugar to muscovado composition.

08:30.820 --> 08:32.539
- Yeah.
- I'm just going to pop them in the oven.

08:32.539 --> 08:35.260
And you're confident about getting
it all finished and looking good?

08:35.260 --> 08:37.820
I have had a couple of
slight meringue collapses,

08:37.820 --> 08:40.380
so I'm a little nervous about
the structure at the end.

08:40.380 --> 08:42.900
But hopefully my added
rings in the centre will...

08:42.900 --> 08:44.700
- Give it support.
- Yeah.

08:44.700 --> 08:47.820
Andrew's engineering
expertise will be fully tested

08:47.820 --> 08:50.100
in his re-creation of
the Queen's Jubilee crown

08:50.100 --> 08:52.300
in muscovado meringue.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.660
It will contain a pecan praline centre

08:54.660 --> 08:56.820
and layers of blackberry fool,

08:56.820 --> 08:59.340
topped off with cassis jelly jewels.

08:59.340 --> 09:01.260
Now, you've chosen a difficult meringue.

09:01.260 --> 09:04.140
Muscovado sugar, being very moist,

09:04.140 --> 09:07.500
and I notice that it is quite
runny now... I hope it holds.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.540
My engineering credentials
are going to be tested.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.340
They will be. Severely.

09:11.340 --> 09:15.740
Right, going in. I'm leaving it in
there for an hour and ten minutes.

09:15.740 --> 09:18.260
They're going to go in the oven
for about an hour and 20 minutes.

09:18.260 --> 09:22.380
I'm baking mine for an hour
on a fairly low temperature.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.740
About 130.

09:23.740 --> 09:25.300
Now is the bit I can enjoy a bit more.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.940
They're in the oven. I can't worry
about them, I can't change them.

09:27.940 --> 09:31.500
It's in the hands of
chemistry and the gods.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.460
The finalists need to spend every minute

09:37.460 --> 09:39.420
that the meringues are in the oven

09:39.420 --> 09:42.540
perfecting their fillings and toppings.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.060
Now I get to make the jellied jewels.

09:45.060 --> 09:47.620
I'm adding gelatine, some creme cassis.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.500
I just love blackberries, so
I'm going for gold and purple.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.460
It was inspired by the
Queen's coronation crown.

09:55.020 --> 09:57.780
I have got some blueberries, a bit
of sugar, a bit of lemon juice,

09:57.780 --> 09:58.980
a little bit of water.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.940
I'm going to make a blueberry compote

10:00.940 --> 10:03.260
and then a strawberry and
raspberry compote as well.

10:03.260 --> 10:05.900
Nothing like British
fresh fruit, is there?

10:05.900 --> 10:07.580
This is my pecan praline.

10:07.580 --> 10:09.940
I'm hoping I've put this on
the right side of the paper.

10:11.380 --> 10:14.620
This is mango curd.

10:14.620 --> 10:16.220
As it's a special occasion,

10:16.220 --> 10:19.540
this is Prosecco for my strawberries.

10:22.300 --> 10:23.940
(Aah!)

10:23.940 --> 10:26.300
There's two sides to the baking paper

10:26.300 --> 10:27.820
and I've put it on the wrong one.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.500
As you can see, it...

10:29.500 --> 10:31.700
Facepalm.

10:33.060 --> 10:37.140
45 minutes remain in the
final Signature Challenge.

10:37.140 --> 10:40.300
The oven is turned off, so I'm
just waiting for them to cool down.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.740
They've finished baking.

10:41.740 --> 10:44.740
Technically now it's more
important to let them cool down

10:44.740 --> 10:46.140
really, really slowly.

10:46.140 --> 10:49.580
Sudden changes in temperature
could destroy the meringue...

10:50.620 --> 10:52.420
I'm just on crack watch.

10:52.420 --> 10:55.300
..and will make constructing
a crown impossible.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.580
Two minutes. I'm just going
to hold my nerve. Two minutes.

10:57.580 --> 10:59.060
I'm coming out. I'm going...

10:59.060 --> 11:02.020
If you rush it, you open the
door of the oven and get them out

11:02.020 --> 11:05.780
and you can hear them
going, "Ping! Ping! Ping!"

11:05.780 --> 11:07.660
You can actually hear them cracking.

11:07.660 --> 11:10.100
I might just put them back

11:10.100 --> 11:12.980
in the open oven just to reduce
the temperature shock a bit.

11:12.980 --> 11:15.300
- What are you listening for?
- I don't know.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.140
Jane just said, "Can
you hear it crackling?"

11:17.140 --> 11:18.940
So I thought I'd listen.

11:18.940 --> 11:20.780
Eat me! Eat me!

11:20.780 --> 11:23.420
This one is looking a little stronger.

11:25.140 --> 11:27.580
Oh, gosh! My stomach just turned over.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.180
The bottom one has cracked.

11:35.980 --> 11:39.780
(Oh, look. They are amazing!)

11:39.780 --> 11:41.620
You can't out-Candice Candice.

11:42.860 --> 11:45.140
You've just got to be
happy with what you do.

11:45.140 --> 11:47.620
Perfection is all I've got to hit today.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.900
Bakers, here's the story.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.060
You've got 15 minutes
on your crowning glory.

11:55.060 --> 11:56.380
I'm sorry to be bore-y.

11:58.540 --> 12:01.220
This is where you find out
if the meringues have stuck,

12:01.220 --> 12:03.620
and try and keep smiling
if that's the case.

12:03.620 --> 12:07.340
'The judges are looking for at least
three tiers of crowning glory.'

12:07.340 --> 12:08.380
Oh, hello!

12:09.540 --> 12:11.940
Oh, don't do that.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.780
My cream has whipped up
nice and light, actually.

12:14.780 --> 12:17.340
It is mascarpone, double
cream and vanilla.

12:18.660 --> 12:20.060
OK.

12:20.060 --> 12:22.140
It looks like we might
have got away with it.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.140
I just need to start constructing.

12:31.540 --> 12:34.980
- What's going on, my love?
- So, I'm going to...

12:34.980 --> 12:37.700
try and stick this on
with a bit of caramel.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.780
Carefully, carefully.

12:39.780 --> 12:43.380
Blueberry compote. It
is a little bit runny,

12:43.380 --> 12:46.740
but what I'm going to do is I'm
going to make a blueberry dam.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.020
God, it's a delicate beast.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.700
Praline to go in the middle.

13:01.020 --> 13:04.140
These are my jewelled pistachios.

13:05.620 --> 13:09.220
This is blackberry fool. I
want this to be slightly sharp.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.780
There is a lot of sugar in the meringue,

13:10.780 --> 13:12.660
so I don't want it to be too sweet.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.460
My bottom is cracking. I can see it.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.580
I'll just about have enough cream.

13:25.060 --> 13:26.100
Whoops!

13:27.260 --> 13:31.060
I'm just going to shine up my Physalis.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.660
You want to make sure you get that right.

13:33.660 --> 13:36.100
Five minutes, bakers.
Just five minutes left.

13:41.740 --> 13:43.180
Oh, jelly. Jelly, jelly!

13:48.860 --> 13:50.660
(He's putting it on the Queen.)

14:06.740 --> 14:08.900
OK, bakers, that's it.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.460
Time is up.

14:10.460 --> 14:11.900
Coronation time, gang.

14:24.740 --> 14:28.180
Paul and Mary are expecting
a spectacular meringue crown

14:28.180 --> 14:31.940
with at least three tiers and
full of delicious fillings.

14:40.420 --> 14:43.980
You've chosen a meringue
using muscovado sugar,

14:43.980 --> 14:46.940
which is very difficult
to get definition.

14:46.940 --> 14:48.420
If we look at the top here,

14:48.420 --> 14:52.380
we haven't got a clear
definition of your icing pipe.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.380
I'm going to take a slice.

14:54.380 --> 14:56.820
You've got to keep it
very much on the head.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.060
Yes.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.940
Tell me, what's happening in the middle?

14:59.940 --> 15:01.540
I put the pecan praline in there.

15:05.860 --> 15:08.500
All the flavours go well.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.060
The praline is very, very sweet

15:11.060 --> 15:13.780
and it's slightly
overpowering everything.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.020
Obviously meringue is sweet,

15:16.020 --> 15:19.900
therefore, for me, the rest
needs to be a little bit sharp.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.860
The fool hasn't got much flavour to it.

15:21.860 --> 15:24.380
I think the meringue's gorgeous.
It's nice and soft inside.

15:24.380 --> 15:25.580
You've got a nice chew.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.620
The jelly, I like. It's
got a lot of flavour in it.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.740
It has got more of a kick,
actually, than the fool has.

15:29.740 --> 15:32.660
I don't like the praline in the
middle, but I love the effect.

15:32.660 --> 15:33.820
OK.

15:46.420 --> 15:47.580
I think it looks great.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.820
I love the pipework. There's
a lot going on in there.

15:49.820 --> 15:52.180
- Yeah.
- I was a bit worried about this little crown on the top,

15:52.180 --> 15:53.860
how you were going to
get it off the moulds,

15:53.860 --> 15:55.260
but you've managed to get it off OK.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.340
It looks impressive,

15:56.340 --> 15:58.900
and I love the way you've
got so many flavours there.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.340
I didn't think you'd finish, but you did.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.660
Oooft!

16:03.660 --> 16:07.180
You can actually feel the texture
of the meringues all the way down.

16:07.180 --> 16:10.700
- Oh!
- The way it's holding is quite impressive.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.660
It's actually staying in one piece,

16:12.660 --> 16:14.860
and what a piece of meringue that is!

16:14.860 --> 16:15.900
Wow!

16:21.340 --> 16:23.500
Your curd is lovely.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.340
The meringue, it's got a
lovely softness in the middle.

16:26.340 --> 16:29.660
There's so many textures in there,
and the flavours are quite sharp.

16:29.660 --> 16:33.020
And you've got the nuts in there as
well, which adds something to it.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.740
Yeah, I like that.

16:34.740 --> 16:37.500
A handshake! Hollywood
handshake!

16:37.500 --> 16:38.900
(Handshake!)

16:46.420 --> 16:49.020
You've made, from
appearance point of view,

16:49.020 --> 16:50.820
a first-rate meringue.

16:50.820 --> 16:53.380
It's held all its shape perfectly.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.660
I can't wait to get the texture
of that meringue, you know.

16:55.660 --> 16:57.340
It does look very impressive.

16:57.340 --> 16:58.980
- Yeah, it does.
- Oh, thank you.

16:58.980 --> 17:02.340
Oh, the way that the
knife just falls through!

17:02.340 --> 17:04.339
Look how solid it is at
the bottom there as well.

17:04.339 --> 17:05.460
Perfect, isn't it?

17:10.260 --> 17:12.780
The flavours go very well.

17:12.780 --> 17:17.740
Your coulis is sharp, and do
you know what is really sharp?

17:17.740 --> 17:19.220
The peach on top,

17:19.220 --> 17:22.420
which is just what you
need with a pavlova.

17:22.420 --> 17:24.540
Because it's so tall,

17:24.540 --> 17:27.420
it's very difficult for it
to actually hold together

17:27.420 --> 17:29.100
when you cut it.

17:29.100 --> 17:33.500
Your description of a sort of
pavlova trifle is about right.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.340
I sense... I knew... Oh, hello!

17:35.340 --> 17:36.780
Oh, thank you!

17:36.780 --> 17:38.220
Thank you.

17:38.220 --> 17:39.740
Three layers of heaven.

17:39.740 --> 17:42.260
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you very much indeed.

17:49.620 --> 17:52.300
I'm absolutely delighted.
I got the handshake!

17:52.300 --> 17:54.140
When Candice got her
handshake, I thought,

17:54.140 --> 17:55.660
"I've never seen two handshakes.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.580
"I've never seen two
handshakes. Not a chance."

17:58.580 --> 18:00.180
And I got a handshake!

18:01.180 --> 18:04.260
He's giving out handshakes willy-nilly.

18:04.260 --> 18:07.020
But, no, Jane's did look spectacular.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.460
First bake of final done

18:08.460 --> 18:11.060
and I couldn't really have
got off to a better start,

18:11.060 --> 18:12.540
which is amazing.

18:12.540 --> 18:15.900
It was a bit of a kick in the teeth
to have, like, the double handshake.

18:15.900 --> 18:18.980
I can deal with one.
Two is a bit, like...

18:18.980 --> 18:20.900
Really, I need to come
first in the Technical.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.140
Definitely at the back of
the pack at the moment.

18:36.700 --> 18:41.660
Now, bakers, this is your
last ever Technical Challenge.

18:41.660 --> 18:42.860
Any advice, Mary?

18:42.860 --> 18:45.820
This bake will be very familiar,

18:45.820 --> 18:49.100
but there are one or two
tricky things about it.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.540
Wow, cryptic!

18:50.540 --> 18:53.300
Now, off you both go to
your intimacy workshop.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.700
Catch you later.

18:54.700 --> 18:59.140
OK. Now, Mary would love you to make a...

18:59.140 --> 19:02.580
Victoria sandwich with
jam and buttercream.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.060
But there's a twist.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.940
Lift that up, you'll see boxing gloves.

19:05.940 --> 19:08.620
Put them on, then the Zorro mask,
then just tease the trousers down

19:08.620 --> 19:10.100
and you're ready to go.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.020
You've got an hour and a
half on your challenge.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.020
- On your marks...
- Get set... - Bake!

19:17.220 --> 19:18.260
OK.

19:20.580 --> 19:22.940
We have absolutely no instructions.

19:22.940 --> 19:24.340
Are you ready for this?

19:24.340 --> 19:27.580
"Make a Victoria sandwich
using two 20cm tins

19:27.580 --> 19:29.540
"filled with raspberry
jam and buttercream."

19:29.540 --> 19:30.580
That's it.

19:31.580 --> 19:32.940
Right.

19:32.940 --> 19:36.940
So, Mary, you've chosen a classic
challenge for the last Technical.

19:36.940 --> 19:38.780
Victoria sandwich.

19:38.780 --> 19:41.580
We've given them no recipe, no method,

19:41.580 --> 19:43.500
just two tins and the ingredients.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.460
Now, you've judged quite
a few Victoria sandwiches

19:46.460 --> 19:48.420
- in your time, I'm sure.
- I've never counted.

19:48.420 --> 19:52.260
I mean, I've done village
shows, county shows, schools...

19:52.260 --> 19:54.380
So I know exactly what it should be.

19:54.380 --> 19:56.180
They can do it by the all-in-one method,

19:56.180 --> 19:57.820
they can do it by the creaming method,

19:57.820 --> 20:01.060
but it should look exactly
like that when it's finished.

20:02.340 --> 20:06.380
Beautifully level, a very even rise,

20:06.380 --> 20:08.980
pale golden all the way around,

20:08.980 --> 20:10.620
and a beautiful texture inside.

20:10.620 --> 20:12.980
It's going to be fascinating
to see how they cope with this.

20:12.980 --> 20:15.100
I hope the bakers come up
with something that's good.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.140
I think they will.

20:19.580 --> 20:21.420
Unsalted butter, we've got salted butter.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.180
We've got medium eggs,
we've got large eggs.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.380
We've got... No idea what that is.

20:26.700 --> 20:31.460
My ratios are 225g of self-raising flour,

20:31.460 --> 20:34.060
butter, sugar, four large eggs...

20:34.060 --> 20:36.500
I'm going to go for four large eggs.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.980
Victoria sponge is all about
having exactly the same amount

20:38.980 --> 20:41.300
of every ingredient.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.380
I'm weighing the eggs
because it's the final

20:43.380 --> 20:46.500
and weighing the eggs feels
like the right thing to do.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.700
259g of everything.

20:49.700 --> 20:54.700
So, 227 self-raising, butter and caster.

20:54.700 --> 20:57.460
I always use golden caster sugar at home,

20:57.460 --> 21:00.220
so I'm going to use
golden caster sugar here.

21:00.220 --> 21:03.220
I'm going to go caster. I
don't want it to be too dark.

21:05.060 --> 21:09.020
I'm going to do it exactly how
I do it at home, all in one.

21:10.540 --> 21:12.420
I'm going to do an all-in-one method,

21:12.420 --> 21:14.860
which is a Mary favourite, I think.

21:14.860 --> 21:16.980
I'm going to cream the
butter and sugar first.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.260
I'm going to go for the creamy method.

21:19.260 --> 21:21.580
I don't actually make a
lot of Victoria sponges.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.940
I'm relying on memory.

21:22.940 --> 21:26.420
We should know how to do
it, but if it goes wrong,

21:26.420 --> 21:29.420
we're going to use look pretty daft.

21:29.420 --> 21:32.860
Have I put everything in
that I should have done?

21:32.860 --> 21:34.780
Eggs might help.

21:34.780 --> 21:37.260
How are you, love? How's the final going?

21:37.260 --> 21:39.420
I could use with this one
being a good one, to be honest.

21:39.420 --> 21:42.300
To be out of the handshake
club was a little demoralising.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.420
- Matey!
- I know, the double handshake.

21:44.420 --> 21:46.340
But the handshake
doesn't mean everything.

21:46.340 --> 21:48.940
You have come back from things
before, Andrew, haven't you?

21:48.940 --> 21:50.620
I have, but this isn't about coming back,

21:50.620 --> 21:52.980
this is about ending up on top, isn't it?

21:52.980 --> 21:54.660
(Oh, Andrew, that's fighting talk!)

21:54.660 --> 21:56.900
I mean, you've got to be open
at this stage, haven't you?

21:56.900 --> 21:59.740
- Everyone wants to win.
- Everyone. - Everyone in this tent.

21:59.740 --> 22:00.780
Or die trying!

22:04.020 --> 22:05.700
Just to be extra anorak-like,

22:05.700 --> 22:09.140
I'm going to make sure I weigh
how much batter goes into each.

22:09.140 --> 22:12.980
Slightly larger tins than I
use at home, but that's fine.

22:12.980 --> 22:14.980
Just whack in some more mix.

22:16.220 --> 22:17.860
It is important that it is level.

22:17.860 --> 22:20.460
If it doesn't go right,
then I'm in big trouble.

22:21.660 --> 22:23.460
I'm going in!

22:23.460 --> 22:26.740
I should have 456 in each
if I've done that correctly,

22:26.740 --> 22:28.220
which I hope I have.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.660
There we go. 180 for 15 minutes,

22:32.660 --> 22:34.940
but I think it will be more like 20, 25.

22:34.940 --> 22:38.900
I've put it on 180 for 20
minutes to start off with.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.620
I just really want to
get it in the oven now

22:40.620 --> 22:42.140
cos I'm very behind the other two.

22:43.380 --> 22:45.980
I'm going to go in with that.

22:45.980 --> 22:47.860
Mid-shelf.

22:47.860 --> 22:50.620
Start with 20, and then
I'll keep an eye on them.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.860
I'm nervous about this,

22:51.860 --> 22:54.420
because a tiny imperfection in a cake

22:54.420 --> 22:56.700
could mean last in the Technical.

22:56.700 --> 22:59.500
It's got to be right. Got to be right.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.900
I am just going to get my jam on.

23:03.900 --> 23:07.580
I'm going for half the quantity
of sugar to raspberries.

23:07.580 --> 23:10.140
- Is it?
- I'm using 50-50.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.900
Just the way I make it at home.

23:11.900 --> 23:17.620
I've gone for 350g of
raspberries and 150g of sugar.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.500
I never use buttercream at home.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.060
A drop more milk in there.

23:22.060 --> 23:23.900
You don't want it to be too thick.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.980
In my experience, adding
it a spoonful at a time

23:25.980 --> 23:27.460
gives a smoother buttercream.

23:27.460 --> 23:31.940
I've tried it all-in-one before,
but it tends to go a bit grainy.

23:33.460 --> 23:35.820
It could be the smallest
thing today that clinches it.

23:35.820 --> 23:37.540
I need this.

23:37.540 --> 23:38.940
I really need this.

23:38.940 --> 23:42.180
Bakers, just half an hour till
I have your cake and eat it.

23:44.940 --> 23:48.540
Mary is going to be looking
for a nice golden colour.

23:48.540 --> 23:51.940
Maybe a little rise,
but more or less flat.

23:54.140 --> 23:55.660
A bit dark on top.

24:01.980 --> 24:04.260
(Mine are flatter than
Candice's, though.)

24:06.780 --> 24:10.740
Relatively happy. They're
the right colour, so...

24:10.740 --> 24:13.660
Candice's look good and Andrew's
look really nice over there as well.

24:15.460 --> 24:17.820
(Oh, it's tense, this, isn't it?)

24:17.820 --> 24:21.300
My jam is not as firm
as I'd like it to be.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.580
Another 15 minutes in the
fridge will probably help.

24:24.580 --> 24:27.300
All going for seedless over there.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.340
This is my interpretation.

24:29.340 --> 24:31.620
It's either going to work, or it's not.

24:36.820 --> 24:40.780
You have five minutes left on your
last-ever Technical Challenge.

24:42.820 --> 24:45.860
It is the final, so I'm going
to pipe the buttercream in.

24:46.980 --> 24:49.660
We're going to end up
doing the very same look.

24:49.660 --> 24:51.820
It means there'll be
more direct comparisons.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.940
If I'm honest, being
directly compared to Jane

24:53.940 --> 24:55.340
is quite intimidating.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.140
I think that looks yummy.

25:12.060 --> 25:14.900
Right, you magnificent
spongers, time is up.

25:14.900 --> 25:17.660
Could you bring them up to
the gingham table, please?

25:23.660 --> 25:27.540
Mary and Paul are looking for
a perfect Victoria sandwich

25:27.540 --> 25:31.260
with a light sponge filled with
raspberry jam and buttercream icing.

25:32.860 --> 25:35.540
OK, shall we start with this one, Mary?

25:35.540 --> 25:37.300
This one looks quite dark, actually.

25:37.300 --> 25:40.860
It looks a bit too dark, and this
jam doesn't look as though it's set.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.900
You can see it dripping
down the side there.

25:42.900 --> 25:46.060
It's really a jelly rather than a jam,

25:46.060 --> 25:48.180
because the pips have been taken out.

25:49.700 --> 25:52.620
The actual sandwich -
the structure looks good.

25:52.620 --> 25:55.540
It's a good, even texture throughout.

25:55.540 --> 25:57.420
I think the Victoria
sandwich tastes good,

25:57.420 --> 25:59.140
but that buttercream is quite grainy.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.300
Right, moving on. This has
a nice texture on this one.

26:01.300 --> 26:03.580
It's quite even. I like
the colour on this as well.

26:03.580 --> 26:05.060
I like the buttercream in there.

26:05.060 --> 26:07.860
- It's quite neat.
- Looks a very good jam there.

26:09.580 --> 26:12.100
It's a good thing I like
a Victoria sandwich.

26:12.100 --> 26:15.420
You notice what a big piece
I'm taking of each one!

26:15.420 --> 26:17.380
It's buttery, it's got good flavour.

26:17.380 --> 26:20.220
- That's a good Victoria sandwich, that, it tastes good.
- Mmm.

26:20.220 --> 26:22.100
Moving on to the last one, Mary.

26:22.100 --> 26:24.460
It's a little bit on the dark side

26:24.460 --> 26:28.340
and it has a very large rise to it.

26:28.340 --> 26:30.780
I think it's got a lot
of mixture in there.

26:30.780 --> 26:32.700
- A lot of mixture.
- It's considerably bigger.

26:32.700 --> 26:35.980
The buttercream is a
bit on the soft side.

26:35.980 --> 26:37.860
The jam is quite thick, actually.

26:40.100 --> 26:43.340
They have cooked it through,
and it is a good flavour.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.300
OK. This is going to be tricky.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.700
But which finalist has baked

26:49.700 --> 26:52.260
a technically perfect Victoria sandwich?

26:53.380 --> 26:55.660
This has been a very
difficult task for us.

26:55.660 --> 26:57.180
We've been backwards and forwards.

26:57.180 --> 27:01.380
It was very close between two and
three, I'll tell you that much.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.620
In third place is this one.

27:07.340 --> 27:11.260
There was more mixture in there
than I would have expected,

27:11.260 --> 27:14.820
and the jam itself was
a little bit gluey.

27:14.820 --> 27:18.180
And the buttercream was very soft.

27:18.180 --> 27:20.140
In second place is this one.

27:21.620 --> 27:25.940
The flavour of your jam was
better, marginally, than Jane's.

27:25.940 --> 27:28.220
The buttercream, however,
was a little bit grainy.

27:28.220 --> 27:32.220
But the overall flavour of the
sponge was just a little bit better.

27:32.220 --> 27:33.380
Thank you.

27:33.380 --> 27:35.620
And in first place is this one.

27:35.620 --> 27:36.980
Well done, Andrew.

27:36.980 --> 27:41.380
We have an even bake, a
nice pale, golden colour.

27:41.380 --> 27:45.260
We've got a good jam and a
lovely, smooth buttercream.

27:45.260 --> 27:46.980
Thank you.

27:46.980 --> 27:48.540
Well done, well done.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.860
To stand a chance at all,
I needed to come first.

27:50.860 --> 27:53.540
And, yeah, really pleasantly surprised.

27:53.540 --> 27:56.820
Two is all right. I thought
I was going to be third.

27:56.820 --> 28:00.660
I do think, genuinely, we are
all going into it fairly even,

28:00.660 --> 28:02.180
and that's quite nice.

28:02.180 --> 28:06.380
I think the trophy is still
very much up for grabs.

28:20.900 --> 28:25.300
There's just one challenge remaining
in the 2016 Great British Bake Off.

28:27.460 --> 28:30.380
In just a few hours, at
a very special picnic,

28:30.380 --> 28:35.100
either Candice, Jane or Andrew
will be crowned this year's winner.

28:35.100 --> 28:38.860
They're making an awful lot of
stuff in their Showstopper, Mary.

28:38.860 --> 28:40.460
An unbelievable amount.

28:40.460 --> 28:42.860
I mean, it's one of the
most exciting Showstoppers

28:42.860 --> 28:44.260
we've ever had.

28:44.260 --> 28:46.860
I know it's very difficult
judge between just three of them

28:46.860 --> 28:49.500
being so close. Let's cut to the chase.

28:49.500 --> 28:52.660
Candice and Jane are very,
very close in the Signature.

28:52.660 --> 28:55.100
Candice went really
overboard with the meringue.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.260
I think it worked, as well.

28:56.260 --> 28:58.700
Likewise, Jane did the perfect pavlova.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.020
And then it all changed again.

29:00.020 --> 29:02.020
Andrew didn't have such a good Signature,

29:02.020 --> 29:03.420
but he came top in Technical.

29:03.420 --> 29:05.380
It was a very good Victoria sandwich.

29:05.380 --> 29:08.140
Paul gave the double Hollywood handshake

29:08.140 --> 29:09.580
to the ladies in the tent.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.220
He gave a single handshake.

29:11.220 --> 29:13.540
There was a single handshake to Candice.

29:13.540 --> 29:15.100
And there was a full double for Jane.

29:15.100 --> 29:16.580
- The Roman clasp?
- I've never...

29:16.580 --> 29:19.180
We've never seen the Roman clasp
before, I don't think, from Paul.

29:19.180 --> 29:21.540
Is this telling us something
about where they're standing

29:21.540 --> 29:22.660
in the pecking order?

29:22.660 --> 29:25.260
- No.
- Right. I'm glad we started with that, then! - Just checking!

29:33.660 --> 29:38.620
Bakers, welcome to your
final Showstopper Challenge.

29:38.620 --> 29:41.500
Paul and Mary would very much like you

29:41.500 --> 29:44.260
to make a picnic fit for Her Majesty.

29:44.260 --> 29:47.700
What we would like you to make is
one chocolate celebration cake,

29:47.700 --> 29:49.700
which Her Majesty apparently loves.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.660
12 puff-pastry sausage rolls,

29:52.660 --> 29:54.900
12 mini quiches,

29:54.900 --> 29:57.180
12 savoury scones,

29:57.180 --> 30:00.260
and 12 fruit and custard tarts.

30:00.260 --> 30:03.700
That's 49 things altogether each.

30:03.700 --> 30:05.380
You've got 20 minutes. On your marks...

30:05.380 --> 30:07.820
You've got five hours.

30:07.820 --> 30:09.660
- On your marks...
- Get set...

30:09.660 --> 30:10.780
- Good luck, and bake.
- Bake!

30:12.820 --> 30:16.700
Creating a whole range of bakes
for a picnic fit for the Queen...

30:18.340 --> 30:21.620
..is the biggest-ever final
challenge in Bake Off history.

30:21.620 --> 30:26.060
49 little things, all in five hours.

30:26.060 --> 30:28.100
Easy peasy(!)

30:28.100 --> 30:30.260
Keep it together, Andrew...

30:30.260 --> 30:32.860
Five hours seems an awful lot,

30:32.860 --> 30:35.220
but if they don't get
their planning right,

30:35.220 --> 30:36.820
they won't finish on time.

30:36.820 --> 30:38.900
This is batch baking and then some.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.020
All the elements of a picnic
that you can think of.

30:41.020 --> 30:42.900
Every one of those bakes
should be good enough

30:42.900 --> 30:44.100
to put in front of the Queen.

30:44.100 --> 30:46.620
Each item's got to be consistent.

30:46.620 --> 30:49.220
We want a good finish as
well as good flavours.

30:50.780 --> 30:52.860
I'm expecting perfection.

30:52.860 --> 30:54.300
Pastry...

30:54.300 --> 30:56.420
I'm doing my pastries first
so I can get them chilling.

30:56.420 --> 30:58.180
I've got my spreadsheet, which...

30:58.180 --> 31:01.260
I've got every five minutes planned
so I know exactly where I am.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.900
I haven't worked out
timings properly on this,

31:03.900 --> 31:06.380
but I think it should be...
I think it should be...

31:06.380 --> 31:07.540
I think it should be fine.

31:07.540 --> 31:11.020
I know the order, I
know I can get it done.

31:11.020 --> 31:12.460
Going to do it.

31:12.460 --> 31:14.580
- Hello, Candice.
- Good morning.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.740
Right. What's going in your hamper, then?

31:16.740 --> 31:20.860
I am doing a chocolate orange
and orange cardamom cake,

31:20.860 --> 31:22.540
then I am doing sausage rolls -

31:22.540 --> 31:25.340
bacon, mushroom, black
pudding. Little piggies,

31:25.340 --> 31:28.060
so it'll have a little
nose, peppercorn eyes,

31:28.060 --> 31:29.700
with crackling curly tails.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.340
To complete her picnic,

31:31.340 --> 31:34.340
Candice is also making
Manchego and olive scones,

31:34.340 --> 31:36.260
salmon and asparagus quiches

31:36.260 --> 31:38.260
and rhubarb and custard tarts,

31:38.260 --> 31:42.180
all fit for not just a queen,
but pearly kings and queens.

31:42.180 --> 31:45.020
What makes it special for
pearly kings and queens?

31:45.020 --> 31:48.260
It's just a nod to where me
and my dad are from, really.

31:48.260 --> 31:50.740
- Ah, right.
- Cockney, Mary, Cockney. - Cockney.

31:50.740 --> 31:53.740
Candice's journey to the Bake
Off began when she was four,

31:53.740 --> 31:57.260
when her nan, Margaret,
started teaching her to bake.

31:57.260 --> 31:59.780
You always used to like
to wear Nan's glasses.

31:59.780 --> 32:02.620
- Come to that, you used to put Nan's shoes on as well.
- Yep.

32:02.620 --> 32:06.900
My mum was always baking, so Candice
wanted to be in on the action.

32:06.900 --> 32:10.100
I'm so pleased Candice has
achieved this for herself.

32:10.100 --> 32:12.100
I don't think there's any words

32:12.100 --> 32:14.220
that can express how proud we are

32:14.220 --> 32:15.580
as a family.

32:15.580 --> 32:19.420
Candice will go hell for leather
to get whatever she wants.

32:19.420 --> 32:21.300
I'm extremely proud of Candice.

32:21.300 --> 32:22.660
Regardless if she wins

32:22.660 --> 32:24.020
or whether she loses,

32:24.020 --> 32:27.340
she'll always be a winner in
my eyes and she's my daughter.

32:28.660 --> 32:32.180
This is my puff pastry
for my sausage rolls.

32:32.180 --> 32:34.500
I'm going to do my first turn.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.020
I used to hate making puff,
but I do quite enjoy it now.

32:37.020 --> 32:38.620
It's important to keep it cold

32:38.620 --> 32:40.340
just cos you don't want
the butter to melt.

32:40.340 --> 32:43.260
If it softens up, it means you
won't get those nice, puffy layers.

32:43.260 --> 32:45.460
The sooner the bakers
can prepare the pastry

32:45.460 --> 32:47.900
for their sausage rolls and quiches...

32:47.900 --> 32:49.900
(Right, next - next, next, next...)

32:49.900 --> 32:51.980
Get that in the fridge.

32:51.980 --> 32:53.500
Half an hour gone already.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.460
What am I doing now? I don't know.

32:55.460 --> 32:58.580
..the sooner they can begin their
show-stopping chocolate cake.

32:58.580 --> 33:01.420
I'm just liquefying my coconut oil.

33:01.420 --> 33:04.700
So rather than using
butter, I'm using oil.

33:04.700 --> 33:06.220
It just makes it nice and moist.

33:07.300 --> 33:09.860
I like adding ground almonds. I
like what it does to the texture

33:09.860 --> 33:12.100
and it just keeps it a
little bit more moist.

33:12.100 --> 33:14.940
My chocolate cake is my
gran's chocolate cake.

33:14.940 --> 33:17.300
It's kind of our
definitive family recipe.

33:17.300 --> 33:21.420
There is a lot riding on this cake,
so...hopefully, I'll do it justice.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.500
Andrew's picnic of family favourites

33:24.500 --> 33:27.580
will also include smoked
Cheddar and paprika scones,

33:27.580 --> 33:29.420
sausage and chorizo jam rolls,

33:29.420 --> 33:32.420
sweet potato, goat's cheese
and caramelised onion quiches

33:32.420 --> 33:34.740
and strawberry and pistachio tarts.

33:36.820 --> 33:38.700
- I call you "the precision baker".
- Right, OK.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.180
It's all about timing. You've...

33:40.180 --> 33:42.140
Oh, right, you've got
an Excel spreadsheet

33:42.140 --> 33:43.940
- to tell you exactly what's going on.
- Yes, I do.

33:43.940 --> 33:45.940
Minute by minute. We're
wasting time right now.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.100
I'm five minutes behind.

33:47.100 --> 33:49.780
That's every five minutes is planned
so I'm just dashing to the...

33:49.780 --> 33:51.740
Yeah, it says here, actually, that...

33:51.740 --> 33:54.020
Yeah, 9.05, "dash to
fridge". He's on time.

33:54.020 --> 33:56.140
Always a high-flier,

33:56.140 --> 33:58.700
Andrew first discovered
his love of engineering

33:58.700 --> 34:00.620
through his love of cake.

34:00.620 --> 34:03.100
Andrew's always rather
liked chocolate cake

34:03.100 --> 34:06.460
and things and he wanted
to be able to make them.

34:06.460 --> 34:08.460
Andrew has always been very passionate

34:08.460 --> 34:09.699
about anything he's tackled

34:09.699 --> 34:11.420
and Bake Off is no different.

34:11.420 --> 34:13.179
He's been working full-time

34:13.179 --> 34:16.620
and practising to one
o'clock in the morning.

34:16.620 --> 34:18.620
He didn't actually go
to his own graduation.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.620
We went and saw all his friends graduate.

34:20.620 --> 34:21.940
He was baking.

34:21.940 --> 34:25.179
If Andrew takes on any challenge,
he's always put 100% into it.

34:25.179 --> 34:26.340
He's an achiever,

34:26.340 --> 34:29.620
and the success he's had
so far has blown us away.

34:29.620 --> 34:31.900
I absolutely think
Andrew deserves to win.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.940
He's put so much hard work into it

34:33.940 --> 34:36.540
and I hope he does cos
I love him to bits.

34:36.540 --> 34:38.020
He'll hate me saying that!

34:40.139 --> 34:41.980
I'm happy with the
consistency of the cakes.

34:41.980 --> 34:44.699
They've gone in for 15 minutes at 180.

34:44.699 --> 34:47.820
Just making my orange sponge.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.340
This is cardamom and orange

34:49.340 --> 34:52.900
and then I will cover it in an
orange cardamom syrup as well.

34:55.620 --> 34:57.340
Chocolate cake's in the oven.

34:57.340 --> 34:59.580
I've got my puff pastry in the fridge.

34:59.580 --> 35:03.940
I'm just doing sweet
pastry for my fruit tarts.

35:05.220 --> 35:08.700
I mean for this sweet
pastry to be nice and thin,

35:08.700 --> 35:11.060
so about two millimetres.

35:11.060 --> 35:14.260
I want it to be really crisp.
I want Paul to love it.

35:14.260 --> 35:16.660
I don't want to see a
soggy bottom in sight.

35:16.660 --> 35:18.740
I have no idea whether
I'm on schedule or not.

35:18.740 --> 35:23.420
I just have great belief that
if I just keep going today,

35:23.420 --> 35:24.940
if I keep going, it'll all be fine.

35:24.940 --> 35:27.140
Jane's sweetcrust pastry tarts

35:27.140 --> 35:30.980
will be filled with red fruits
and elderflower creme patissiere.

35:30.980 --> 35:34.420
Her picnic will also feature
more of her family's favourites -

35:34.420 --> 35:37.300
butternut squash and Parmesan scones,

35:37.300 --> 35:39.580
apple and thyme sausage rolls,

35:39.580 --> 35:41.220
salmon and dill quiches

35:41.220 --> 35:43.580
and, for her four-tiered chocolate cake,

35:43.580 --> 35:45.060
she's determined to succeed

35:45.060 --> 35:46.300
with a decorative touch

35:46.300 --> 35:48.820
that let her down during botanical week.

35:48.820 --> 35:52.340
It's going to have a
white-chocolate lacy wrap and...

35:52.340 --> 35:54.300
- A collar? You're putting a collar round it?
- Yeah.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.620
- Another collar?
- I know, but it's going to be good this time.

35:56.620 --> 35:59.660
- Victorian lacy collar.
- It's going to be good this time!

36:01.820 --> 36:04.260
Jane has always worked
hard to create great bakes

36:04.260 --> 36:06.460
for her family and friends.

36:06.460 --> 36:09.580
But since the competition,
she's gone to new extremes.

36:09.580 --> 36:11.860
Mum hasn't slept much

36:11.860 --> 36:13.700
for the last 12 weeks.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.140
I'll come down in the morning,
she's there, furiously baking,

36:16.140 --> 36:18.140
has been awake since five
o'clock in the morning,

36:18.140 --> 36:19.340
there's flour everywhere.

36:19.340 --> 36:22.620
Already, she's made three
different sets of Danish pastries,

36:22.620 --> 36:24.420
a wedding cake, a loaf of bread...

36:24.420 --> 36:26.020
Yeah, she's been a bit obsessed.

36:26.020 --> 36:27.860
Can you believe you're in the final?

36:27.860 --> 36:30.020
I don't actually believe
I'm in that tent.

36:30.020 --> 36:31.980
Mum's amazing at juggling everything.

36:31.980 --> 36:34.980
She's managed to do
everything for Bake Off,

36:34.980 --> 36:36.980
she's running her own business.

36:36.980 --> 36:38.540
I don't know how she's done it all.

36:38.540 --> 36:40.740
She's always put other people first

36:40.740 --> 36:44.100
and this is the first thing
she's done purely for herself.

36:44.100 --> 36:45.900
I really am very proud of you.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.900
I know everybody thinks it, but
I think I've got the best mum.

36:52.780 --> 36:55.660
Right, the moment of
truth. How's this pastry?

36:57.540 --> 36:59.140
These are my sweet ones.

36:59.140 --> 37:01.500
The pastry has caught on the edges.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.620
"12.02, Sue comes in
and asks inane questions

37:03.620 --> 37:05.940
"about what are you doing" -
what are you doing, Andrew?

37:05.940 --> 37:07.860
I can always trust you
to be on schedule, Sue.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.020
It's lovely.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.620
Everything is important
in the Showstopper.

37:13.620 --> 37:14.900
Absolutely everything.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.820
Right, here we go.

37:20.820 --> 37:22.140
Scones, actually.

37:22.140 --> 37:25.060
Have I put everything in?
Squash, salt and pepper.

37:25.060 --> 37:26.380
Pepper? No, no pepper.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.980
This is my mum and gran's scone recipe,

37:29.980 --> 37:32.820
quite traditional Irish thing,
kind of a soda bread method.

37:32.820 --> 37:36.140
So I'm mixing my flour,
bicarb, some paprika,

37:36.140 --> 37:38.340
buttermilk and some smoked Cheddar.

37:38.340 --> 37:42.300
Handling it as little as possible
is the secret to good scones.

37:42.300 --> 37:44.580
The temptation is to roll it out too far.

37:46.820 --> 37:49.740
Quite a wet dough, so
it's sticking a bit.

37:52.660 --> 37:54.660
Two-and-a-half hours remaining.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.500
This is my creme patissiere,

37:58.500 --> 38:00.740
which is going to go in my
fruit and custard tarts.

38:00.740 --> 38:02.380
Not sure what the other bakers are doing.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.180
I think they're making
their sausage rolls,

38:04.180 --> 38:05.460
which is what I SHOULD be doing.

38:05.460 --> 38:08.780
With 49 bakes to complete
and only one oven...

38:08.780 --> 38:11.300
I'm going to assemble my
whole sausage roll in one.

38:11.300 --> 38:13.980
Then I can get exactly
the same size piggies.

38:13.980 --> 38:17.660
..time management has never
been harder or more important.

38:17.660 --> 38:18.940
Puff's looking all right.

38:19.900 --> 38:23.140
Yeah, puff's looking...
Puff's looking OK.

38:23.140 --> 38:26.820
The amount of multitasking
required here is mind-blowing.

38:26.820 --> 38:29.140
If I didn't have a plan
right now, I'd be flapping.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.980
Ah!

38:30.980 --> 38:32.340
I am going faster and faster.

38:32.340 --> 38:33.700
I've got so many timers,

38:33.700 --> 38:36.180
I'm not sure what the
timers are for, now.

38:36.180 --> 38:37.860
We are steaming through.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.620
Some of these poor piggies
might be a little cross-eyed.

38:43.860 --> 38:46.260
Give them another...minute or two.

38:54.780 --> 38:56.900
They really haven't risen at all.

38:58.140 --> 39:00.020
They really haven't risen at all.

39:04.260 --> 39:08.260
Outside the tent, the contestants'
friends and family have arrived,

39:08.260 --> 39:11.060
along with a few familiar faces.

39:11.060 --> 39:12.900
I was quite anxious coming here.

39:12.900 --> 39:15.500
Gingerbread falling down,
that was my last experience.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.660
But no, it's really nice,

39:16.660 --> 39:18.540
it's lovely seeing all the bakers again.

39:18.540 --> 39:20.140
It's been really special.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.820
It's really funny being back.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.940
Of course I'd love to be
in the tent right now.

39:23.940 --> 39:25.980
Great to be here, would
LOVE to be in there.

39:28.180 --> 39:30.500
Oh, my gosh, who's going to
win it? Who's going to win it?

39:30.500 --> 39:32.460
Don't ask me that question.

39:32.460 --> 39:33.540
Candice.

39:33.540 --> 39:38.660
She plans well, she's impeccable,
and she is so focused.

39:38.660 --> 39:40.380
I've been backing Jane since week one.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.180
I want Andrew to win...

39:43.540 --> 39:44.820
..but it'll be a tough call,

39:44.820 --> 39:46.780
cos the girls have
been very, very strong.

39:46.780 --> 39:49.340
You know, Candice has been
Star Baker so many times

39:49.340 --> 39:53.580
and Andrew and Jane have both
been so consistent - oh...!

39:53.580 --> 39:55.100
I think I'm going to have to say Jane.

39:57.540 --> 40:01.700
OK, finalists, you've got an
hour left of your Showstoppers.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.180
One hour left.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.700
Right, calm down, now.

40:07.700 --> 40:11.380
I have got my collar and the
decoration to do on this.

40:11.380 --> 40:13.580
I've got assembly of
the fruit tarts to do.

40:13.580 --> 40:15.500
I've still got to bake my quiches.

40:15.500 --> 40:19.420
So, um...quite a lot to get done, really.

40:19.420 --> 40:25.740
I'm just melting my chocolate
for my chocolate icing

40:25.740 --> 40:28.020
and just waiting for my
sausage rolls to cook.

40:29.340 --> 40:31.860
I'm ashamed of myself for
not measuring out the pastry.

40:31.860 --> 40:34.340
But got to get these
sausage rolls finished,

40:34.340 --> 40:35.780
so...screw the measurements.

40:37.180 --> 40:38.860
Is that pastry too thick?

40:40.140 --> 40:41.380
I don't know.

40:42.580 --> 40:45.220
Asparagus going into the
coffin there, lovely.

40:49.700 --> 40:52.740
Just left it a little
bit too long in the oven.

40:54.980 --> 40:57.620
I'm going to put some foil over the top.

40:57.620 --> 41:00.660
Should hopefully stop
them browning too much.

41:00.660 --> 41:03.140
OK, picnickers, you don't want
to keep a good wasp waiting.

41:03.140 --> 41:05.820
You've got half an hour
to finish, half an hour.

41:05.820 --> 41:08.220
I'm going to have to do
the chocolate collar now.

41:13.780 --> 41:16.820
It's a very simple and easy
chocolate collar this time.

41:16.820 --> 41:18.820
Got to try and chill that somehow.

41:18.820 --> 41:20.700
Are you all right, Jane?

41:20.700 --> 41:22.500
I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine.

41:23.500 --> 41:26.100
OK. I've caught the edges of these.

41:27.580 --> 41:29.620
So this is my sugar glaze.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.980
It just makes it look
shiny and nice, really.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.500
Right. One, two, three...

41:37.500 --> 41:39.180
You can't leave it in there very long,

41:39.180 --> 41:40.900
otherwise it won't be flexible at all.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.140
One, two, three, four...

41:49.540 --> 41:51.020
Those need at least an extra five.

41:52.460 --> 41:54.260
Those are going to come out very hot.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.380
Oh, stick, damn you, stick!

42:01.620 --> 42:04.500
- (That's good.)
- Ooh, look at the rise on those!

42:05.940 --> 42:09.060
OK, ladies and gent, I
have no wish to HAMPER you,

42:09.060 --> 42:14.980
but you have five minutes left
on your final Showstoppers.

42:14.980 --> 42:16.100
Ah...!

42:33.260 --> 42:35.620
It's not doing it! It's not coming off!

42:37.740 --> 42:40.140
I have a minor disaster here.

42:42.220 --> 42:43.740
My chocolate collar,

42:43.740 --> 42:47.420
I over...over-chilled it.

42:47.420 --> 42:50.100
And it doesn't want to come off.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.940
I don't quite know what
I'm going to do about that.

42:52.940 --> 42:55.980
OK, little piggies need to
put things in the hamper,

42:55.980 --> 42:57.740
little piggies need to
stop in two minutes.

42:57.740 --> 42:59.220
These are the sausage rules.

43:03.980 --> 43:06.780
My collar is not to be. What a pity.

43:10.260 --> 43:13.180
Oh, if in doubt, throw some
glitter at it, I always say.

43:31.620 --> 43:34.620
OK, bakers, five hours is up.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.460
You can do no more.

43:38.460 --> 43:40.500
- You've finished!
- Wahey, well done!

43:42.460 --> 43:45.740
Oh, well done, guys, well done!

43:45.740 --> 43:47.220
My God.

43:49.340 --> 43:50.500
That was mad.

43:54.180 --> 43:57.060
I honestly don't know if
I've done enough to win.

43:57.060 --> 44:01.420
It'll all come down to the
quality of the pastry and flavours

44:01.420 --> 44:03.700
and you can't tell that
from looking at them.

44:03.700 --> 44:09.060
I will always see the negatives,
always see the bits I don't like,

44:09.060 --> 44:11.860
always think everybody
else's is better, but...

44:14.020 --> 44:16.420
...I have just...I have given it...

44:16.420 --> 44:17.740
I've given everything.

44:18.820 --> 44:20.660
I think I could cry.

44:20.660 --> 44:25.140
I think it's just the
emotion of finishing

44:25.140 --> 44:26.660
and not doing it again.

44:26.660 --> 44:27.900
I think that's really sad.

44:27.900 --> 44:30.020
I'll really miss it.
I've loved every minute.

44:30.020 --> 44:31.940
I'm going to just wipe my eyes now.

44:32.980 --> 44:35.100
Cos I'm not going to cry.

44:35.100 --> 44:36.500
But it's been great.

45:00.820 --> 45:03.580
Jane, do you want a hand
with your hamper goods?

45:14.820 --> 45:18.500
I'm sure the Queen would love
this colourful selection,

45:18.500 --> 45:20.500
and it does look right royal and regal.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.660
Thank you. Thank you very much.

45:22.660 --> 45:24.620
So let's start with the sausage roll.

45:27.460 --> 45:29.660
You've got some issues with
raw pastry inside here.

45:29.660 --> 45:30.700
Oh, is it?

45:30.700 --> 45:33.060
- You see the layers?
- Oh, yes.

45:33.060 --> 45:34.700
It hasn't baked all the way through.

45:34.700 --> 45:37.100
- But the flavour... Tastes delicious.
- Thank you.

45:37.100 --> 45:39.700
This is the tart.

45:39.700 --> 45:41.060
Pale, but baked.

45:41.060 --> 45:42.340
Nice and crispy.

45:43.380 --> 45:47.860
It looks absolutely cram-jam
full of salmon and prawn.

45:51.140 --> 45:54.020
Mmm. It's very, very good.

45:54.020 --> 45:56.420
Right - scone.

46:01.340 --> 46:02.900
To me, with my eyes shut,

46:02.900 --> 46:05.860
it tastes like a rather
good cheese scone.

46:05.860 --> 46:09.340
I don't actually taste
the butternut squash.

46:09.340 --> 46:11.580
Which is a shame. It
would've been nice to get

46:11.580 --> 46:13.780
something with a little
bit more kick in it.

46:13.780 --> 46:17.940
These tarts - the decoration
on the top is so pretty,

46:17.940 --> 46:20.140
you couldn't resist picking those up.

46:23.740 --> 46:27.660
You've managed to keep that
pastry beautifully crisp.

46:27.660 --> 46:31.740
The creme pat has held and none
of it is dripping down the side.

46:31.740 --> 46:33.140
The flavour's good.

46:33.140 --> 46:35.460
Right. We'll move on to your cake.

46:39.380 --> 46:43.020
It isn't what you planned, your
band, but you didn't panic.

46:43.020 --> 46:44.060
You've done it.

46:45.660 --> 46:48.620
Now, that's a lovely surprise
in the middle, there.

46:52.460 --> 46:54.380
- Great chocolate cake.
- Thank you.

46:54.380 --> 46:57.180
- Tastes beautiful. It's light...
- Thank you. - Soft...

46:57.180 --> 46:58.860
And then with that cream in the middle,

46:58.860 --> 47:00.540
with the kick from the cherries...

47:00.540 --> 47:03.220
That's beautiful. It's a
shame about the collar.

47:09.900 --> 47:11.300
Andrew.

47:20.020 --> 47:21.660
It is beautifully displayed.

47:21.660 --> 47:24.060
Very meticulous, just like you.

47:24.060 --> 47:26.940
Everything we've seen
has been very calculated

47:26.940 --> 47:28.660
and beautifully presented.

47:28.660 --> 47:30.700
Right, we'll start with the sausage roll.

47:31.860 --> 47:33.180
Let's have a quick cut.

47:34.300 --> 47:35.620
It's not done here.

47:36.700 --> 47:37.740
Yeah.

47:38.980 --> 47:40.780
The taste of that sausage is fantastic.

47:40.780 --> 47:42.180
Beautiful sausages,

47:42.180 --> 47:45.020
but it's such a thick layer
of undercooked pastry.

47:45.020 --> 47:46.620
I think I'd be leaving that.

47:48.340 --> 47:49.380
Scone.

47:54.660 --> 47:59.100
I think the colour and the
look of them is most exciting,

47:59.100 --> 48:01.020
but the flavour just isn't there.

48:02.180 --> 48:04.380
I'm trying to find the
cheese. I've got the paprika.

48:05.380 --> 48:06.620
I'm not getting it at all.

48:06.620 --> 48:08.180
Let's try the quiche.

48:09.540 --> 48:11.860
Nice colour. It's nice and neat
all the way round, as well.

48:11.860 --> 48:13.900
Looks like it's been
professionally blocked.

48:15.380 --> 48:18.300
- Crispy.
- That's the right thickness of pastry.

48:22.860 --> 48:24.340
The flavour of that is delicious.

48:24.340 --> 48:25.820
OK.

48:25.820 --> 48:29.220
However, you probably worked that
pastry a little bit too much.

48:29.220 --> 48:31.500
That should just fall apart.

48:31.500 --> 48:33.740
Let's try the strawberry tart.

48:37.580 --> 48:40.580
Now, obviously, straightaway,
there is an issue with this.

48:40.580 --> 48:41.740
- Yeah.
- I daren't even lift it.

48:41.740 --> 48:43.380
I know it's going to be soggy underneath.

48:46.820 --> 48:48.820
Well, it's basically raw underneath

48:48.820 --> 48:51.740
because everything's soaked
in to that blind-baked pastry.

48:53.380 --> 48:54.900
Actually, it tastes good.

48:54.900 --> 48:58.620
I think the problem is, when
you put the sugar syrup on it,

48:58.620 --> 49:00.340
it's soaked into the side of the pastry

49:00.340 --> 49:02.020
and so the whole thing just collapsed.

49:02.020 --> 49:04.700
OK. Let's have a look at this cake.

49:06.060 --> 49:09.540
- Those shards are beautiful on top.
- Cuts great.

49:09.540 --> 49:11.580
You said this was your grandma's recipe?

49:11.580 --> 49:12.620
Yes.

49:16.900 --> 49:18.340
That's a great cake.

49:18.340 --> 49:20.020
That's a really nice cake.

49:20.020 --> 49:21.780
She'll be very pleased to hear that.

49:21.780 --> 49:23.780
The ganache keeps it moist.

49:23.780 --> 49:25.740
It's a very, very good chocolate cake.

49:25.740 --> 49:27.620
I think that's the
star piece in all this.

49:27.620 --> 49:29.900
- I'd have the cake any day.
- OK.

49:29.900 --> 49:31.340
Thank you.

49:44.060 --> 49:47.580
It looks an exciting
hamper. Lots of colour.

49:47.580 --> 49:50.020
I love your little piggies looking at me.

49:50.020 --> 49:51.260
I'm dying to get into them.

49:51.260 --> 49:52.700
- That's its mouth, I take it?
- Yeah.

49:52.700 --> 49:55.060
- Nose, eyes...
- Yeah. - Yeah, OK. - And its little crispy tail.

49:57.660 --> 49:59.460
Love crackling. Right...

50:04.140 --> 50:05.380
Mmm...

50:05.380 --> 50:07.340
That's a good puff pastry.

50:07.340 --> 50:09.220
Nice flaky layers.

50:09.220 --> 50:11.020
Unusual, with the black pudding.

50:11.020 --> 50:13.300
I think they're great. I
think the flavour's fantastic.

50:13.300 --> 50:14.700
And you've got beautiful layers.

50:14.700 --> 50:17.580
- Thank you.
- OK. Shall we move on to the quiche?

50:20.100 --> 50:22.940
Ooh, yeah. Crispy all
the way. Sides, bottom...

50:22.940 --> 50:24.340
It's full, that, Mary, isn't it?

50:24.340 --> 50:27.900
What I like is it's not all
sort of custardy filling.

50:27.900 --> 50:29.900
We've got lots of salmon in here.

50:33.860 --> 50:35.860
That's a good quiche. And it tastes good.

50:35.860 --> 50:37.900
- Thank you.
- And the pastry's in nice layers.

50:37.900 --> 50:39.380
It is. It's well baked.

50:39.380 --> 50:41.100
Right, scone.

50:41.100 --> 50:44.020
Nice colour on the top, nice size.

50:49.380 --> 50:51.220
I can't taste the cheese.

50:51.220 --> 50:52.740
- OK.
- Manchego's strong.

50:52.740 --> 50:55.140
The problem is, olives are SO strong.

50:55.140 --> 50:57.460
- I can taste the olive but I didn't get the cheese.
- OK.

50:57.460 --> 51:01.180
Let's look at these
raspberry and rhubarb tarts.

51:01.180 --> 51:05.220
They look attractive, and nice
to do it in a brioche tin,

51:05.220 --> 51:07.220
rather than the conventional tin.

51:11.220 --> 51:13.100
That's a good custard.

51:13.100 --> 51:16.420
- Thank you.
- Rhubarb, you're very brave to put it in,

51:16.420 --> 51:18.380
because there's so much moisture,

51:18.380 --> 51:20.980
and in no way is that
soaking into the pastry,

51:20.980 --> 51:22.980
the pastry is still crisp.

51:22.980 --> 51:24.660
- It's a little over-baked.
- Yeah.

51:24.660 --> 51:27.860
But the whole flavour is very, very good.

51:27.860 --> 51:29.580
Let's try the chocolate.

51:48.780 --> 51:50.060
That's a lovely cake.

51:51.500 --> 51:52.820
The oil works well in it,

51:52.820 --> 51:55.500
and the flavour of the orange
comes through beautifully as well.

51:55.500 --> 51:56.620
Delicious orange.

51:56.620 --> 51:59.700
You've got the right amount of ganache,

51:59.700 --> 52:01.300
and I like the finish, as well.

52:01.300 --> 52:04.860
I think that would be a great
cake to take on a picnic.

52:04.860 --> 52:07.980
- Thank you very much.
- No, thank you. Thank you very much.

52:13.940 --> 52:15.060
It's you two.

52:15.060 --> 52:17.020
- No, no.
- It is!

52:28.140 --> 52:31.900
As Candice, Andrew and Jane
join their family and friends...

52:34.860 --> 52:37.740
..Mary and Paul have a
huge decision to make.

52:39.300 --> 52:43.420
Well, this was an absolute
humdinger of a Showstopper.

52:43.420 --> 52:45.740
The standard was exceptionally high.

52:45.740 --> 52:49.100
Andrew's chocolate cake
was out of this world.

52:49.100 --> 52:51.780
It had a beautiful texture, flavour.

52:51.780 --> 52:54.100
But the fruit tart -
it was falling apart.

52:54.100 --> 52:56.020
And the scones - no flavour.

52:56.020 --> 52:59.100
Then you have Candice, who
is this very creative baker.

52:59.100 --> 53:00.740
Everything packed with flavour.

53:00.740 --> 53:02.780
Now, when you look at the actual quiche,

53:02.780 --> 53:04.700
she put loads and loads
of salmon in there,

53:04.700 --> 53:06.420
but it did taste extremely good.

53:06.420 --> 53:07.540
Her sausage rolls...

53:07.540 --> 53:09.740
I've had many sausage rolls in my time.

53:09.740 --> 53:11.780
- I bet you have.
- And to make a little pig out of one...

53:11.780 --> 53:14.140
They were different, and
the pastry was good, too.

53:14.140 --> 53:16.820
- It's a sensational cake, isn't it?
- That orange!

53:16.820 --> 53:19.660
And it was so soft inside. Great cake.

53:19.660 --> 53:24.020
I like Jane because she
is a true family cook.

53:24.020 --> 53:27.820
Her prawn quiche was
absolutely delicious.

53:27.820 --> 53:30.260
I thought the fruit tart tasted great.

53:30.260 --> 53:33.100
The sausage roll was slightly underdone.

53:33.100 --> 53:35.380
Paul and Mary, the big
question is...who's won?

53:35.380 --> 53:37.540
I've sort of made up my mind.

53:37.540 --> 53:39.020
I've had a thought myself,

53:39.020 --> 53:40.660
but I want to confirm it with Paul.

53:40.660 --> 53:42.980
That seems reasonable, bearing
in mind you're the judges.

53:42.980 --> 53:44.540
We shall leave now.

53:58.060 --> 54:02.220
Finalists, what
incredible bakers you are!

54:02.220 --> 54:04.540
Would the three of you step up, please?

54:12.060 --> 54:14.020
- MEL:
- Oh, Jane... Jane's gone!

54:16.660 --> 54:18.940
Jane, Andrew, Candice,

54:18.940 --> 54:23.340
Mary and Paul have decided,
after a lot of deliberation,

54:23.340 --> 54:28.900
that the winner of The
Great British Bake Off 2016

54:28.900 --> 54:30.100
is...

54:38.260 --> 54:39.580
..Candice!

54:49.580 --> 54:52.820
- Well done!
- Well done, Candice!

54:58.060 --> 54:59.540
Well done!

54:59.540 --> 55:01.660
Well done, sweetheart.

55:05.900 --> 55:09.100
Never, ever, ever thought
I'd ever even get on this,

55:09.100 --> 55:14.380
and I'm standing here now with
this, and they said my name,

55:14.380 --> 55:16.620
and that means more to me

55:16.620 --> 55:18.660
than I think anyone
will ever, ever realise.

55:18.660 --> 55:20.780
It really, really does.

55:20.780 --> 55:22.420
Well deserved!

55:22.420 --> 55:25.140
Her determination and passion...

55:25.140 --> 55:27.860
She really has excelled.

55:27.860 --> 55:32.180
Had wonderful flavours, and
everything always looked gorgeous.

55:32.180 --> 55:34.500
Candice is very much all or nothing.

55:34.500 --> 55:36.660
When you look back on some of her bakes,

55:36.660 --> 55:38.100
they've been beautiful.

55:38.100 --> 55:40.700
When she nails it, she's one of the best.

55:40.700 --> 55:42.460
Come over!

55:53.020 --> 55:54.700
Oh, my God!

55:54.700 --> 55:56.860
Candice has been fantastic throughout.

55:56.860 --> 55:58.420
'I'm chuffed to bits for her.'

55:58.420 --> 56:01.500
You deserve it, Candice. Well, well done.

56:01.500 --> 56:03.620
Of course I'm a little
disappointed, but actually,

56:03.620 --> 56:06.500
to be able to walk out there at the
end with the hamper, see everyone...

56:06.500 --> 56:08.060
Yeah, it's really special.

56:08.060 --> 56:11.780
Oh, you star! Well done!

56:11.780 --> 56:14.660
'The best baker today won.
I'm really happy for her.

56:14.660 --> 56:17.580
'Week after week, Candice
has got better and better.'

56:17.580 --> 56:18.860
I predicted it!

56:18.860 --> 56:21.820
So my first prediction of
the series has come true...

56:21.820 --> 56:22.860
dammit!

56:30.700 --> 56:37.860
Em... I saw, and I wished,
and I hoped it was OK,

56:37.860 --> 56:39.460
but you just don't know.

56:39.460 --> 56:41.980
Jane and Andrew are so good, so good.

56:43.500 --> 56:47.340
She's done so well. She's
been an absolute star.

56:49.620 --> 56:51.340
I did it! I'm good.

56:51.340 --> 56:53.100
I'm good enough.

56:57.020 --> 56:59.060
I honestly...

56:59.060 --> 57:00.380
I don't know what to say.

57:00.380 --> 57:01.980
Thank you. Like...

57:01.980 --> 57:04.900
Oh, my God! What an opportunity.

57:08.940 --> 57:11.500
Amazing! I don't know what else to say.

57:14.580 --> 57:17.580
- She did smash it.
- She did smash it.
