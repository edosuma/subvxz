01:03.230 --> 01:05.964
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.300 --> 01:08.333
Great!

01:08.335 --> 01:10.002
To start today's adventure,

01:10.004 --> 01:12.771
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.673
Yo-ho-ho!

01:14.675 --> 01:16.675
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.677 --> 01:18.010
One more time.

01:18.012 --> 01:20.079
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.316 --> 01:25.884
<i>[Jake]</i> Peter's Musical Pipes.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.886
[Peter laughing]

01:27.888 --> 01:30.889
- [all snoring]
- [pipes playing]

01:33.093 --> 01:34.693
Huh?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.896
What's that sound?

01:41.201 --> 01:44.703
Look! It's a set of
bamboo musical pipes!

01:44.705 --> 01:46.371
This must be
what we heard.

01:46.373 --> 01:51.243
[playing up-tempo song]

01:51.245 --> 01:54.246
Crackers! That's a catchy tune.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.882
Look!
A note from Peter Pan.

01:57.884 --> 02:00.419
"Take these pipe's
to Great Tree Glade.

02:00.421 --> 02:04.289
A musical treasure appears
when their tune is played!"

02:04.291 --> 02:07.860
Great Tree Glade is on
my map of Never Land!

02:07.862 --> 02:11.964
Mateys, will you join our search
for Peter's musical treasure?

02:13.299 --> 02:16.802
Great! Remember to keep a
look out for gold doubloons.

02:16.804 --> 02:20.105
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

02:20.107 --> 02:23.675
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.844
Is everybody ready?

02:25.846 --> 02:28.347
- I've got my sword.
- I got my map!

02:28.349 --> 02:31.150
And I've got
my pixie dust.

02:31.152 --> 02:34.386
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.688
But only in emergencies.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.158
Yo-ho! Let's go!

02:43.763 --> 02:46.365
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

02:56.777 --> 02:58.810
<i>¶ And me </i>

03:01.014 --> 03:05.751
Mr. Smee! The ship's wheel
came off in me hands again!

03:05.753 --> 03:09.354
Did I not ask Sharky
and Bones to tighten it?

03:09.356 --> 03:12.291
Uh, yes, cap'n,
I... I believe you did.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.726
Sharky! Bones!

03:14.728 --> 03:17.729
At your service, cap'n!
[laughing]

03:17.731 --> 03:19.364
Ready to hear a song?

03:19.366 --> 03:22.234
No! I'm ready to hear why

03:22.236 --> 03:25.270
you haven't done
your pirate chores.

03:25.272 --> 03:28.774
Well, we've been too busy
practicin' a new song

03:28.776 --> 03:30.876
just for you, sir.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.112
I don't need singers,
I need sailors.

03:34.114 --> 03:39.351
I order both of you
scurvy swabs to walk
the plank!

03:39.353 --> 03:41.220
- Aye-aye.
- Aye... aye.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.088
[playing funeral dirge]

03:43.090 --> 03:47.092
We'll just play music
for the fishies... Whoa!

03:48.795 --> 03:51.196
To get to
Great Tree Glade

03:51.198 --> 03:53.966
we need to cross
Cattail Chasm.

03:53.968 --> 03:56.802
How we supposed
to get across that?

03:56.804 --> 03:58.870
[Bones] That's a
really good question.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.573
[all] Sharky and Bones!

04:01.575 --> 04:03.275
[both] Ahoy, popinjays!

04:03.277 --> 04:05.811
Um, where's Captain Hook?

04:05.813 --> 04:08.413
Cap'n Hook made us
walk the plank.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.749
Crackers! Tough break.

04:10.751 --> 04:14.886
We heard your tune and came
to see if you wanted to jam!

04:14.888 --> 04:19.258
Sounds fun, but Peter Pan
left us these musical pipes.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.226
We're taking them
to Great Tree Glade

04:21.228 --> 04:23.495
where the tune will
reveal a treasure.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.765
But Cattail Chasm has
kind of slowed us down.

04:26.767 --> 04:32.204
[Bones] Say, these cattails
are a-swaying to a lovely beat.

04:32.206 --> 04:35.807
One-two, one-two, one-two!

04:35.809 --> 04:38.310
One-two.
Play along, Jake!

04:40.380 --> 04:43.315
Crackers and cheese,
that swings!

04:43.317 --> 04:47.486
And it gives us all a way
to swing across the chasm!

04:47.488 --> 04:49.955
Here I go!

04:49.957 --> 04:53.959
One-two, one-two, one-two.

04:53.961 --> 04:58.297
[all] One-two, one-two, one-two,

04:58.299 --> 05:00.932
one-two, one-two!

05:00.934 --> 05:02.968
Yo-ho, way to go!

05:02.970 --> 05:06.905
We did it! We got
across Cattail Chasm.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.808
And we got three gold doubloons.

05:09.810 --> 05:13.879
Let's grab them and go find
Peter's Musical Treasure.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.548
You know, we could use some
singing and playing help.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.417
Would you like to join us?

05:18.419 --> 05:20.886
Well, blow me down!

05:27.994 --> 05:30.562
You know what would go
nicely right about now?

05:30.564 --> 05:32.230
What's that, sir?

05:32.232 --> 05:35.200
A treasure hunting tune!

05:35.202 --> 05:38.904
But, sir, I thought you said
you needed sailors, not...

05:38.906 --> 05:40.939
At sea, I need sailors.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.576
On a treasure hunt,
I need music.

05:44.578 --> 05:49.247
- [soft music plays]
- Smee, what's that sound?

05:50.983 --> 05:54.086
Look, Smee.
Sharky and Bones.

05:54.088 --> 05:57.956
Those sea dogs have
taken up with Jake
and his puny pirate crew.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.258
Where do you suppose
they're going?

06:00.260 --> 06:04.930
Where else? Hunting treasure.
We must follow them.

06:04.932 --> 06:08.033
Whatever treasure they're
after, will soon be mine.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.503
Jump! [screaming]

06:11.505 --> 06:13.872
Oh, dear me. Oh, my!

06:15.975 --> 06:18.443
- [snoring]
- [Izzy] Shiver me timbers!

06:18.445 --> 06:20.579
It's Tiki Tree nap time!

06:20.581 --> 06:23.648
We'll never get past
their branches.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.251
Hey, Jake.
Maybe the Tiki Trees

06:26.253 --> 06:28.053
would like a
nap time lullaby?

06:28.055 --> 06:31.556
Then maybe they'd sway,
and we could get past them.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.658
Sharky, Bones?

06:33.660 --> 06:36.027
[playing softly]

06:39.232 --> 06:41.133
It's working, mateys!

06:49.976 --> 06:52.144
[whispering]
Yo-ho, way to go.

06:52.146 --> 06:54.546
We got past the
sleepy Tiki Trees,

06:54.548 --> 06:57.048
and got three more
gold doubloons.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.984
Let's grab 'em and go.

07:02.088 --> 07:06.091
Barnacles! We must wake
these trees and get through!

07:06.093 --> 07:07.592
But how?

07:07.594 --> 07:11.329
Uh, Smee, sing...
like Sharky and Bones!

07:11.331 --> 07:12.531
[clearing throat]

07:12.533 --> 07:15.534
¶ Oh, wake up
sleepy trees ¶

07:15.536 --> 07:17.469
¶ And start a
brand-new day... ¶

07:17.471 --> 07:19.171
- Huh?
- [grumbling]

07:19.173 --> 07:21.606
It's working.
The trees are waking up.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.675
¶ Shake your sleepy leaves...

07:23.677 --> 07:25.544
[Tiki Tree]
Get them out of here!

07:25.546 --> 07:29.114
- Move it, Hook!
- [yelling and screaming]

07:31.584 --> 07:33.151
Great Tree Glade!

07:33.153 --> 07:35.387
Where Peter said
the treasure would be.

07:35.389 --> 07:40.025
- Uh, now what?
- Well, Peter said,

07:40.027 --> 07:41.993
"Take these pipe's
to Great Tree Glade.

07:41.995 --> 07:45.030
A musical treasure appears
when their tune is played"!

07:45.032 --> 07:46.531
Hit it, Jake!

07:47.533 --> 07:50.669
I'll take that,
if you please. [cackles]

07:50.671 --> 07:54.506
- [both] Hi, cap'n!
- You two scurvy swabs!

07:54.508 --> 07:57.642
Singing for the puny
pirates now, are you?

07:57.644 --> 08:01.112
[gasping] Whoopsie!
Oh, the pipes!

08:01.114 --> 08:03.248
I've got...

08:03.250 --> 08:05.016
[both] Half of them?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.718
Sorry, Captain Hook.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.720
Now that
the pipes are broken,

08:08.722 --> 08:11.189
you can't play the tune
to reveal the treasure.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.525
And neither can you, Jake.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.994
Looks like you and me
have to work together.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.497
Or should I say,
play together.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.433
Fine. I want to
see the treasure.

08:21.435 --> 08:24.636
I'll play the first half,
and you play the last half.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.071
Ready?

08:27.473 --> 08:31.042
[forcing stifled breaths]

08:31.044 --> 08:33.078
[groaning] Blast!

08:33.080 --> 08:35.313
This thing is
impossible to play.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.382
Too bad you don't
have some mateys

08:37.384 --> 08:40.452
who are good at playing music.
They could play it for you.

08:40.454 --> 08:44.089
Quiet down, popinjay,
I'm getting an idea.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.526
Sharky! Bones!
Would you bilge rats...

08:47.528 --> 08:52.030
...I mean, mateys,
like to re-join me crew?

08:52.032 --> 08:55.333
Well, if you promise

08:55.335 --> 08:58.503
never to make us
walk the plank again.

08:59.805 --> 09:01.773
Oh, very well.
You have my word.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.376
All right, ye swabs.

09:04.378 --> 09:07.212
Play that tune!

09:08.080 --> 09:12.684
[playing tune]

09:12.686 --> 09:17.155
[playing tune back]

09:17.157 --> 09:21.393
[Izzy] The treasure
of Peter Pan's Pipes!

09:21.395 --> 09:24.829
Well, shiver me timbers.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.703
[all exclaiming]

09:31.705 --> 09:34.739
[playing soft tune]

09:36.609 --> 09:39.110
[sighing] It's wondrous.

09:39.112 --> 09:44.616
I must control that
miraculous tree all by meself!

09:44.618 --> 09:46.718
Grab those pipes, boys!

09:47.486 --> 09:51.156
Gotcha!
Here ya go, Jake.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.692
What...
What are you doing?

09:53.694 --> 09:57.195
He's returning 'em
to them who owns 'em.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.464
They don't belong
to us, cap'n.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.633
[stammering]
We're pirates!

10:01.635 --> 10:04.269
Of course we take things
that don't belong to us.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.338
Ooh, that's it!

10:06.340 --> 10:07.872
When we get back to the ship

10:07.874 --> 10:11.276
you two landlubbers
are going to walk the...

10:11.278 --> 10:13.712
Ah-ah-ah, cap'n!

10:13.714 --> 10:16.114
You gave your word.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.249
Blast and barnacles!

10:18.251 --> 10:21.152
[sighing] But I still
want those pipes.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.488
Oh, I'll get 'em meself.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.658
Izzy, it's time
to go, go, go!

10:26.660 --> 10:28.126
Aye-aye, Jake!

10:28.128 --> 10:30.462
Pixie dust away!

10:30.464 --> 10:32.130
[Hook] Give me those pipes!

10:32.132 --> 10:34.466
[grunting] Blast and barnacles.

10:34.468 --> 10:38.470
Yo-ho, we unlocked
Peter's Musical Treasure!

10:38.472 --> 10:42.273
And helped Sharky and Bones
get back on Hook's crew.

10:43.209 --> 10:46.211
And we got four
more gold doubloons!

10:46.213 --> 10:49.247
Let's grab 'em and go
back to Pirate Island!

10:51.417 --> 10:53.284
Now, let's count
our gold doubloons

10:53.286 --> 10:55.920
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.497
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:05.499 --> 11:07.532
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:07.534 --> 11:09.567
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

11:09.569 --> 11:12.470
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

11:12.472 --> 11:14.906
Come on. Count with us.

11:15.608 --> 11:16.741
[all] Yeah!

11:18.277 --> 11:21.279
[Izzy] One, two, three...

11:21.281 --> 11:23.448
[Cubby] Four, five, six...

11:23.450 --> 11:26.785
[Jake] Seven,
eight, nine, ten.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.888
Yo, ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:29.890 --> 11:33.792
we got ten gold doubloons.

11:33.794 --> 11:37.362
Thanks for helping us
find Peter's Musical
Treasure, mateys.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.501
Ah, ship, sweet ship.
[chuckling]

11:43.503 --> 11:46.504
It's good to be home, cap'n!

11:46.506 --> 11:50.508
- Eh. Now back to your chores!
- [both] Aye-aye, cap'n!

11:50.510 --> 11:52.844
Coil that rope!
Fix that wheel!

11:52.846 --> 11:55.714
And sing me a song
while you're at it.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.382
[Sharky and Bones]
Aye-aye, cap'n!

11:59.318 --> 12:01.352
<i>¶ Oh, Captain Hook</i>
<i>is a cranky crook ¶</i>

12:01.354 --> 12:03.655
<i>¶ An odd-fish, cod fish</i>
<i>sneaky snook ¶</i>

12:03.657 --> 12:07.625
[Hook] Ah, Smee,
it's music to me ears.

12:07.627 --> 12:12.564
[Smee] Mine, too,
cap'n, sir. Mine, too.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.837
<i>[Jake]</i> The Never Night Star.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.539
[Cubby] Awesome stars!

12:21.541 --> 12:25.477
Ooh! Those look
like a mermaid!

12:25.479 --> 12:28.546
[Jake] Yeah! And those look
like Captain Hook's hook!

12:28.548 --> 12:31.449
[Skully] Crackers!
I see crackers!

12:31.451 --> 12:34.753
- [item falling]
- Whoa! Check out that glow.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.889
That star is shining way
brighter than all the others.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.558
I've seen that one
on my star map.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.961
It's the Never Night Star!

12:42.963 --> 12:47.966
I heard that it shines down on
the legendary Lost City of Gold.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.335
Yo-ho, let's go!

12:50.337 --> 12:52.537
Um... where is it, Cubby?

12:52.539 --> 12:57.609
Well, it's in Dark-Dark Valley,
but that place is really dark!

12:57.611 --> 13:01.646
I bet if we follow the
light of the Never Night Star,
we could find it.

13:01.648 --> 13:05.316
Say, mateys, will you help us
find the Lost City of Gold?

13:06.986 --> 13:10.822
Great! Remember to keep a
look out for gold doubloons.

13:10.824 --> 13:13.992
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

13:13.994 --> 13:17.595
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

13:17.597 --> 13:21.599
Yo-ho, let's go follow
the Never Night Star!

13:25.571 --> 13:28.573
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

13:28.575 --> 13:31.009
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:31.011 --> 13:32.577
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

13:32.579 --> 13:35.513
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:35.515 --> 13:38.783
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:38.785 --> 13:40.618
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:44.723 --> 13:46.524
Step lively, men!

13:46.526 --> 13:49.093
There must be treasure
around here somewhere!

13:49.095 --> 13:52.797
Um, cap'n, might we have
better luck in the morning?

13:52.799 --> 13:55.533
It is getting a wee bit late.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.835
Yeah, what if we get...

13:56.837 --> 13:58.603
[gasping] ...lost?

13:58.605 --> 14:02.540
Nonsense! I know
exactly where I'm going.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.541
[yelling]

14:03.543 --> 14:05.643
Maybe we can follow that star?

14:05.645 --> 14:07.579
- [Bones] Sparkly.
- [Sharky] Oh, shiny.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.547
What are you babblers
babbling about?

14:09.549 --> 14:11.749
[Jake] Come on, crew!
This way.

14:11.751 --> 14:14.552
[gasping] It's Jake
and his puny pirates.

14:14.554 --> 14:18.122
Come on, mateys!
I can't wait to find
the Lost City of Gold.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.591
[all] Me, too!

14:19.593 --> 14:21.626
All we got to do
is take this trail

14:21.628 --> 14:23.461
through Dark-Dark Valley.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.798
[Cubby] I'm just glad
the Never Night Star
is lighting up the way.

14:26.800 --> 14:32.036
A Lost City of Gold!
Do you know what that means?

14:32.038 --> 14:34.873
Methinks someone
lost a whole city.

14:34.875 --> 14:39.444
I'll do the me-thinking
around here and methinks

14:39.446 --> 14:43.081
we should find this
Lost City of Gold
before those puny pirates!

14:43.083 --> 14:48.419
Follow me, men, toward the
light of that shiny star.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.588
<i>¶ Sparkle star</i>
<i>above so shiny ¶</i>

14:50.590 --> 14:53.424
<i>¶ Great big light</i>
<i>from one so tiny ¶</i>

14:53.426 --> 14:55.760
<i>¶ Please help us</i>
<i>find the City of Gold ¶</i>

14:55.762 --> 14:59.397
<i>¶ Or cap'n won't</i>
<i>let us go home ¶</i>

14:59.399 --> 15:02.533
Quickly, men!
We'll cross the river, and...

15:02.535 --> 15:05.803
[stammering] Uh, but, cap'n,
this isn't just any river,

15:05.805 --> 15:09.407
this is
Slippery Snake River.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.577
Is there snakes?
Did you say "snakes"?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.580
Maybe just this one time,
we let Jake and his crew

15:15.582 --> 15:17.949
have the treasure
and go home. [chuckling]

15:17.951 --> 15:19.450
Never!

15:19.452 --> 15:22.620
I will not lose treasure
to those puny pirates!

15:22.622 --> 15:23.988
Careful, cap'n!

15:23.990 --> 15:26.691
Them snakes can be
mighty dangerous.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.093
- [snakes hissing]
- You're not helping!

15:29.095 --> 15:33.698
[exhales] Now let me
give this bridge the boot.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.937
Ha! Jake will never be able
to cross this river full of...

15:38.939 --> 15:40.571
- [hissing]
- Snakes!

15:40.573 --> 15:42.707
- [all yelling]
- [hissing]

15:42.709 --> 15:44.809
[gasping] Snakes!

15:45.911 --> 15:48.813
Sounds like someone
doesn't like snakes!

15:48.815 --> 15:50.882
[Hook] Blasted snakes!

15:50.884 --> 15:53.584
That someone sounds
like Captain Hook.

15:53.586 --> 15:57.655
I'll bet that sneaky snook
is after the Lost City of Gold.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.558
We can't let Hook
find the Lost City first!

16:00.560 --> 16:04.729
We've got to get across
the river, but how?

16:04.731 --> 16:06.764
I've got an idea!

16:06.766 --> 16:09.500
If we all climb onto
this tall palm tree,

16:09.502 --> 16:11.202
we could weigh it down.

16:11.204 --> 16:15.907
Maybe then, the tree
will bend across the river
to the other side.

16:15.909 --> 16:17.976
Let's try it,
but be careful

16:17.978 --> 16:20.678
and don't get too
close to the snakes.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.654
Yay-hey! We got
across the river

16:29.656 --> 16:31.956
and we got two gold doubloons!

16:31.958 --> 16:33.791
Let's grab them...

16:33.793 --> 16:35.760
And go follow
the Never Night Star

16:35.762 --> 16:37.829
to find the
Lost City of Gold.

16:40.699 --> 16:44.802
Ah-ha! We have finally
reached the Dark-Dark Valley.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.071
Uh, which path do we take?

16:48.774 --> 16:52.176
Huh, I wonder if this is the
way to the Lost City of Gold?

16:52.178 --> 16:54.779
Bust me button
I bet you're right, Bones.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.950
Wait! If even you
two can figure out
which path to take,

16:58.952 --> 17:02.854
then so can
the pint-size
popinjays!

17:02.856 --> 17:05.790
We must make sure that
Jake and his little crew

17:05.792 --> 17:10.728
stay in the dark.
Men, turn that rock!

17:11.563 --> 17:13.731
[grunting]

17:13.733 --> 17:18.970
[laughing] Now Jake
won't know which path to take.

17:18.972 --> 17:24.542
Forward ho!
My City of Gold awaits!

17:24.544 --> 17:27.712
Iffin' Jake be the one
who's supposed to get lost,

17:27.714 --> 17:30.648
then how come we're the ones
who can't see where we're going?

17:31.750 --> 17:35.653
- Blast!
- [all yelling]

17:39.124 --> 17:41.993
Gee, I thought the star
was going to be lighting up

17:41.995 --> 17:46.130
the Lost City of Gold,
not some silly old rock.

17:46.132 --> 17:49.734
Well, maybe one of these paths
will lead us to the city.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.771
If only we had a clue
to help us pick the right path.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.140
Yo-ho, what do you know.

17:56.142 --> 17:59.210
I can see myself
in this side of the rock!

17:59.212 --> 18:02.180
Whoa! That light really shines.

18:02.182 --> 18:05.616
Hey, it looks like
this rock was moved.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.319
Maybe if we move it
back into position

18:08.321 --> 18:10.655
it will shine on the right path.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.324
Come on, let's all
turn the rock!

18:13.326 --> 18:17.595
[grunting]

18:17.597 --> 18:19.030
Woo-hoo!

18:19.032 --> 18:23.067
All right! We turned the rock
and lit up the way to go.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.603
And we got three more
gold doubloons!

18:25.605 --> 18:27.972
Let's grab them and go.

18:29.741 --> 18:33.277
- Yo, whoa!
- Coconuts!

18:33.279 --> 18:36.180
- Wowee!
- [Jake] Follow the light.

18:36.182 --> 18:39.250
We're all about to see
the Lost City of... Huh?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.119
Snakes!

18:41.121 --> 18:43.921
[giggling] Cubby,
those aren't snakes,

18:43.923 --> 18:47.859
- those are just vines.
- Oh, I knew that... Kind of.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.393
Crackers and cheese!

18:49.395 --> 18:51.829
It's all been
a wild goose chase.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.198
[sighing] I guess
the Lost City of Gold

18:54.200 --> 18:57.268
will always be just that, lost!

18:57.270 --> 19:00.838
- We can't give up, Cubby.
- Listen up, crew.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.940
Maybe there's another
one of those shiny rocks

19:02.942 --> 19:04.876
- that can help us.
- Yeah!

19:04.878 --> 19:08.212
Maybe we should look
where the light is shining.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.014
Like under those vines.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.953
[grunting]

19:15.955 --> 19:17.355
Good thinking, crew.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.424
Here's another one
of those shining rocks!

19:20.426 --> 19:21.859
[grunting]

19:23.195 --> 19:25.196
Yo, whoa!

19:25.198 --> 19:28.332
The most
awesome coconuts ever!

19:28.334 --> 19:31.068
Welcome to the
Lost City of Gold!

19:31.070 --> 19:33.404
And what a city it is, too!

19:33.406 --> 19:35.907
A city made of solid gold.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.242
Just the way I like it!

19:38.244 --> 19:41.279
Hey! Who invited
Old Feather Hat?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.014
I don't need an invitation.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.917
I'm Captain Hook,
and I'm here to claim

19:45.919 --> 19:49.754
this golden city all for meself!

19:49.756 --> 19:51.222
Look again, Hook.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.991
I don't think the city
is really made of gold.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.160
It just looks like gold
because it's lit up

19:56.162 --> 19:59.063
by the golden starlight
of the Never Night Star!

19:59.065 --> 20:03.201
- Beautiful isn't it?
- Beautiful, bah.

20:03.203 --> 20:06.837
Your puny pirate tricks
won't work on me this time, lad.

20:06.839 --> 20:11.242
I'm taking that city,
every last golden brick of it!

20:11.244 --> 20:13.010
[Izzy] Yay-hey, no way!

20:13.012 --> 20:15.713
It's not right to
destroy the city, Hook!

20:15.715 --> 20:18.015
I know how to keep Hook
from wrecking it.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.951
See these vines?

20:19.953 --> 20:21.919
What if Hook thought
they were snakes?

20:21.921 --> 20:23.754
He'd run off!

20:23.756 --> 20:24.922
And he wouldn't
stop running

20:24.924 --> 20:27.892
till he was way,
way, way far away!

20:27.894 --> 20:29.193
Oh, Captain Hook?

20:29.195 --> 20:33.731
What is it now?
Can't you see I'm busy?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.099
I've got gold to plunder.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.401
I just wanted to tell you
to watch your step,

20:37.403 --> 20:39.203
there might be
snakes around here.

20:39.205 --> 20:41.138
Snakes!

20:41.140 --> 20:44.809
- Here? Where?
- [all] There!

20:44.811 --> 20:46.177
- Run, boys, run!
- [all yelling]

20:46.179 --> 20:49.847
This place is slitherin'
with slitherin' snakes!

20:49.849 --> 20:52.516
Woo-hoo! Your plan worked, Jake!

20:52.518 --> 20:55.253
Yay-hey, Hook ran away!

20:55.255 --> 20:57.421
We saved the
Lost City of Gold

20:57.423 --> 21:00.091
and we got four more
gold doubloons!

21:00.093 --> 21:02.126
Let's grab them
and go explore

21:02.128 --> 21:03.928
the Lost City of Gold!

21:04.296 --> 21:07.198
Pixie dust away!

21:07.200 --> 21:11.068
- Yo, whoa!
- Coconuts!

21:11.070 --> 21:13.037
Wowee!

21:14.339 --> 21:15.973
This is so cool!

21:15.975 --> 21:17.541
- Woo-hoo!
- Whee!

21:20.979 --> 21:24.115
Thanks for helping us find
the Lost City of Gold, mateys.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.050
Now, let's count
our gold doubloons

21:26.052 --> 21:28.419
and put 'em in
Team Treasure Chest.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.095
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:38.097 --> 21:40.131
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:40.133 --> 21:42.166
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

21:42.168 --> 21:45.102
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

21:45.104 --> 21:47.505
Come on. Count with us.

21:48.573 --> 21:50.041
[all] Yeah!

21:51.176 --> 21:53.044
[Jake] One, two...

21:53.046 --> 21:55.579
[Cubby] Three,
four, five...

21:55.581 --> 21:59.450
[Jake] Six, seven, eight, nine!

21:59.452 --> 22:03.154
[Jake] Yo, ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:03.156 --> 22:05.423
we got nine gold doubloons.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.360
Thank you,
Never Night Star.

22:09.362 --> 22:13.130
You really helped
us out tonight.

22:13.132 --> 22:17.068
<i>¶ Thanks for your light</i>
<i>Never Night Star ¶</i>

22:17.070 --> 22:22.139
<i>¶ Hope you can hear me</i>
<i>up where you are ¶</i>

22:22.141 --> 22:27.078
<i>¶ Thanks for the light</i>
<i>you're sharing tonight ¶</i>

22:27.080 --> 22:30.514
<i>¶ Thank you</i>
<i>Never Night Star ¶</i>

22:34.619 --> 22:39.990
Oh, dear. I was so hoping that
this was the way out of here.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.992
Hmm...
I think it's that way.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.527
Or that way.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.364
Oh, just follow me,
you bumblers.

22:46.366 --> 22:49.400
Captain Hook always
knows where he's going,

22:49.402 --> 22:51.469
and he's going...

22:51.471 --> 22:54.138
...down!

22:54.140 --> 22:55.339
[splashing]

22:57.109 --> 23:00.177
- Cap'n?
- Save me, Smee!

23:03.215 --> 23:05.116
On me way, cap'n!

23:07.052 --> 23:08.285
[upbeat rock music playing]

23:08.287 --> 23:09.420
<i>- ¶ Grab 'em! </i>
<i>- ¶ And go! </i>

23:09.422 --> 23:10.988
