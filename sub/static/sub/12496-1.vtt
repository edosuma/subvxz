07:30.417 --> 07:32.750
We only need

07:30.417 --> 07:32.750
one volunteer.

07:33.208 --> 07:35.041
I'm one volunteer.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.875
Perhaps this young lady

07:36.375 --> 07:38.875
can help us.

07:40.041 --> 07:40.959
Me?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.250
Now, miss,

07:41.000 --> 07:42.250
pick a card.

07:43.917 --> 07:44.792
Any card.

07:45.709 --> 07:47.000
I really got to get to work.

07:47.041 --> 07:48.417
Pick a card.

07:48.458 --> 07:49.166
All right.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.583
[laughs]

07:50.625 --> 07:52.250
And now that she's

07:50.625 --> 07:52.250
chosen her card,

07:52.291 --> 07:53.709
we place the girl

07:53.750 --> 07:57.709
into the magical can of trash.

07:57.750 --> 07:58.792
[Charlotte]

07:57.750 --> 07:58.792
Wait, what are you doing?

08:01.125 --> 08:02.125
Hello? Hello?

08:02.166 --> 08:03.250
Mr. Magician man.

08:03.291 --> 08:05.041
And now we do this.

08:03.291 --> 08:05.041
Then we lock that.

08:05.083 --> 08:05.834
We do that.

08:07.083 --> 08:10.166
And then we go like this.

08:07.083 --> 08:10.166
And do this like this.

08:10.208 --> 08:11.000
[Charlotte]

08:10.208 --> 08:11.000
What's going on?

08:13.375 --> 08:14.291
It smells in here.

08:15.583 --> 08:16.959
And now...

08:17.000 --> 08:18.917
Everyone close your eyes.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.000
[Charlotte]

08:21.709 --> 08:23.000
Hello? Hello?

08:29.959 --> 08:31.458
Is it time to open our eyes?

08:31.500 --> 08:32.792
[laughs]

08:35.542 --> 08:38.083
And here's my

08:35.542 --> 08:38.083
special guacamole.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.083
Yeah, and here's my...

08:40.125 --> 08:42.458
Super duper

08:40.125 --> 08:42.458
special guacamole.

08:43.959 --> 08:46.250
Now, which one's better?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.625
Okay, first I'll try

08:46.917 --> 08:48.625
Schwoz's guacamole.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.166
All right.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.166
Now I'll try yours.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.750
Get in there.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.750
Get in there good.

09:02.083 --> 09:05.333
Okay, now, think about the way

09:02.083 --> 09:05.333
the flavors blend,

09:05.375 --> 09:07.291
and you know,

09:05.375 --> 09:07.291
the mouth feel,

09:07.333 --> 09:09.709
- and the way it hits

09:07.333 --> 09:09.709
the back of the--

09:07.333 --> 09:09.709
- Schwoz wins.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.333
Ha.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.000
What?

09:11.041 --> 09:12.792
I win.

09:12.834 --> 09:15.208
I do better things to avocados

09:12.834 --> 09:15.208
than you do to avocados.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.875
No. I protest.

09:16.917 --> 09:17.917
This whole contest was a...

09:18.417 --> 09:19.834
a guacamockery.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.375
I want a second opinion.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.375
Where's Charlotte?

09:22.417 --> 09:23.583
Well, she's not here.

09:23.625 --> 09:24.875
She's late for work?

09:23.625 --> 09:24.875
Great.

09:25.625 --> 09:27.083
The one time we're doing

09:25.625 --> 09:27.083
something important.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.375
[laughs]

09:37.375 --> 09:38.000
[Charlotte]

09:37.375 --> 09:38.000
Hey!

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Hey!

09:40.041 --> 09:41.834
Yes? You have a question?

09:42.375 --> 09:44.125
I have a lot of questions.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.709
[laughs]

09:45.750 --> 09:47.834
Starting with,

09:45.750 --> 09:47.834
who are you

09:47.875 --> 09:50.625
and why did you stick me

09:47.875 --> 09:50.625
in this big box of fruit punch?

09:50.667 --> 09:51.709
[laughs]

09:51.750 --> 09:52.959
You know who I am.

09:53.834 --> 09:57.250
And I know that you know

09:53.834 --> 09:57.250
that I'm Dr. Minyak

09:57.291 --> 10:00.542
because I know that you know

09:57.291 --> 10:00.542
Captain Man and Kid Danger,

10:00.583 --> 10:02.917
which this image proves.

10:04.583 --> 10:07.083
[Charlotte]

10:04.583 --> 10:07.083
Okay, so, what do you

10:04.583 --> 10:07.083
want from me?

10:07.125 --> 10:10.458
I want you to destroy

10:07.125 --> 10:10.458
Captain Man and Kid Danger.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.000
Uhh, yeah, okay.

10:13.041 --> 10:14.834
Just let me out of this

10:13.041 --> 10:14.834
giant juice box

10:14.875 --> 10:16.750
and I'll destroy them right

10:14.875 --> 10:16.750
after I finish my homework.

10:16.792 --> 10:17.875
[laughs]

10:17.917 --> 10:19.834
Oh, I'll release you soon.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.291
After I take control

10:19.875 --> 10:22.291
of your mind

10:22.333 --> 10:25.000
through the use

10:22.333 --> 10:25.000
of musical brain warping.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.333
Musical brain warping?

10:28.166 --> 10:29.208
That's not a thing.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.291
It is too a thing.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.208
[laughs]

10:32.250 --> 10:35.417
You see, by playing the right

10:32.250 --> 10:35.417
combination of musical chords

10:35.458 --> 10:38.542
combining the keys

10:35.458 --> 10:38.542
of F-minor and D-flat,

10:39.125 --> 10:41.959
backed with the right

10:39.125 --> 10:41.959
funky beat,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.208
the human mind opens up

10:42.000 --> 10:45.208
like a thirsty sponge

10:45.542 --> 10:48.000
into which I can

10:45.542 --> 10:48.000
place instructions

10:48.041 --> 10:51.750
through clever rap lyrics

10:48.041 --> 10:51.750
which I've written myself.

10:53.625 --> 10:57.750
So, you're going to take

10:53.625 --> 10:57.750
control of my brain by rapping?

10:57.792 --> 10:59.583
Oh, I won't be rapping.

10:59.625 --> 11:02.583
For that I've hired unknown

10:59.625 --> 11:02.583
hip-hop artist Lil' Biggie.

11:58.583 --> 12:02.250
control of her mind,

12:02.291 --> 12:04.792
she's going to go destroy

Yeah, see, I mush up

12:42.834 --> 12:44.625

12:44.667 --> 12:48.500
and then I add the onions,

and then my secret juices.
