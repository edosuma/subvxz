<span style="style.default_1">Entire Galra fleets have been mobilized.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Zarkon seems to be out looking for Lotor.</span>

01:11.780 --> 01:14.741
[Shiro] It's only a matter of time
before he gets the empire back in order.

01:14.824 --> 01:18.703
-We need to take advantage of this moment.
-What are you getting at, Shiro?

01:18.787 --> 01:22.499
Now is the time to assemble the coalition
that Voltron has been building.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.084
With intelligence gathered by the Blades
and coalition observers,

01:25.168 --> 01:27.420
combined with Pidge's Galra
tracking software,

01:27.504 --> 01:30.465
we now have a detailed map
of the Galra Empire.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.092
I've identified an intermittent line
of coalition planets

01:33.176 --> 01:34.761
that runs through the territory.

01:34.844 --> 01:38.807
If you look closely, there's only one
Galra-occupied planet left on that line.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.560
-Naxzela.
-Exactly.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.396
If we capture Naxzela
and solidify that line,

01:45.480 --> 01:48.775
we can cut off all the Galra troops
behind it from central command

01:48.858 --> 01:51.069
and use our position to defeat them.

01:51.152 --> 01:55.907
Wow! We could take back a third
of the Galra Empire in one fell swoop.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.408
Do we have a plan?

01:57.492 --> 02:01.704
We attack several locations
across the region, at once.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.998
<span style="style.default_1">First, we'll have</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to cut off communications</span>

02:04.082 --> 02:05.834
<span style="style.default_1">between the region</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and Galra Central Command</span>

02:05.917 --> 02:09.128
<span style="style.default_1">by striking the satellite relay station</span>
<span style="style.default_1">orbiting Vantax Five.</span>

02:09.586 --> 02:11.047
Pidge and I can handle that.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.467
The Blades have informed us of two
Galra defense systems coming online

02:14.551 --> 02:16.344
called Zaiforge cannons.

02:16.427 --> 02:19.889
Now, these cannons can strike any target
within our combat theater.

02:20.598 --> 02:23.309
<span style="style.default_1">The first, in high-orbit</span>
<span style="style.default_1">around the planet Teq,</span>

02:23.393 --> 02:26.521
<span style="style.default_1">will be attacked by coalition air forces</span>
<span style="style.default_1">led by Matt and Captain Olia.</span>

02:27.480 --> 02:31.067
<span style="style.default_1">Kolivan will lead a Marmoran strike team</span>
<span style="style.default_1">against the second cannon,</span>

02:31.151 --> 02:32.694
<span style="style.default_1">located on the surface of Senfama,</span>

02:32.777 --> 02:34.863
<span style="style.default_1">which is vulnerable</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to a covert ground attack.</span>

02:36.239 --> 02:38.366
We intend to take control of these cannons

02:38.449 --> 02:41.619
and use Zarkon's own fire power
against him.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.622
Once the coalition forces and Blades
neutralize these targets,

02:44.706 --> 02:46.416
Galra defenses will be weakened,

02:46.499 --> 02:50.461
allowing us to take down the remaining
Galra-occupied planets in this area.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.714
While our forces
are taking control of the planets,

02:52.797 --> 02:55.049
Naxzela will already be under attack.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.386
-By whom?
-Voltron.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.848
Aw, yeah!
Team Voltron's gonna drop in Naxzela,

03:01.931 --> 03:06.436
form Hunk's giant laser cannon,
and be all like, "Pow! Pow! Pow!"

03:06.519 --> 03:07.812
Easy-peasy.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.734
Unfortunately, not that easy.

03:12.817 --> 03:16.487
<span style="style.default_1">Naxzela will be tough.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It's heavily-fortified with Galra.</span>

03:16.571 --> 03:19.198
<span style="style.default_1">Our attack must be swift enough</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to neutralize the Galra forces</span>

03:19.282 --> 03:21.951
<span style="style.default_1">before they have time</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to contact Galra Headquarters.</span>

03:22.410 --> 03:26.414
<span style="style.default_1">'Cause, if they call for reinforcements,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">we'll be caught in a fight on two fronts.</span>

03:27.832 --> 03:30.668
<span style="style.default_1">If this works,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the Voltron Coalition will possess</span>

03:30.752 --> 03:33.254
<span style="style.default_1">a third of the Galra Empire's territory.</span>

03:33.338 --> 03:35.423
<span style="style.default_1">It will be a massive victory.</span>

03:36.007 --> 03:39.093
And inspire
a whole new wave of rebellions.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.553
There's no time to waste.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.815
Ezor, Acxa, set a course
for the coordinates I'm sending you.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.108
[Ezor]
<span style="style.default_1">Where are we going?</span>

03:54.192 --> 03:55.944
<span style="style.default_1">Just do as I say.</span>

03:59.113 --> 04:00.448
<span style="style.default_1">Ezor, what are you doing?</span>

04:00.531 --> 04:03.451
Securing communications
to make sure Lotor can't hear us.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.663
Zarkon called him a criminal.
Lotor's on the run.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.666
-As his generals, that means we--
<span style="style.default_1">-We must trust Lotor.</span>

04:10.250 --> 04:13.628
<span style="style.default_1">What about Narti? She trusted him.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You saw where that got her.</span>

04:15.171 --> 04:18.257
Enough. Lotor will protect us.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.018
[Shiro] <span style="style.default_1">All right, Paladins,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">it's time to gather the coalition.</span>

04:30.186 --> 04:33.690
<span style="style.default_1">Friends and allies from across</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the universe must come together</span>

04:33.773 --> 04:35.149
<span style="style.default_1">to take on the Galra.</span>

04:35.858 --> 04:39.988
<span style="style.default_1">With their help, we'll have a chance</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to turn the tides of this war.</span>

04:40.071 --> 04:41.698
<span style="style.default_1">We all knew this moment would come,</span>

04:42.240 --> 04:45.159
and we are more prepared now
that we've ever been.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.245
Let's do this.

04:55.086 --> 04:59.007
Sir, we're approaching the coordinates,
but my scanners don't detect anything.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.383
[Lotor]
<span style="style.default_1">They're not supposed to.</span>

05:13.396 --> 05:15.773
Lotor, what is this?

05:16.357 --> 05:18.818
The ruins of planet Daibazaal.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.786
What is that?

05:30.538 --> 05:33.791
[Lotor] <span style="style.default_1">Zarkon believed</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that Alfor's plan to blow up Daibazaal</span>

05:33.875 --> 05:37.795
<span style="style.default_1">and destroy the rift between the realities</span>
<span style="style.default_1">actually worked.</span>

05:37.879 --> 05:39.005
No one comprehended

05:39.088 --> 05:43.384
that the experiments of my mother,
Honerva, could never be undone.

05:44.343 --> 05:47.513
<span style="style.default_1">I had a secret team</span>
<span style="style.default_1">construct this inter-reality gate</span>

05:47.597 --> 05:50.224
<span style="style.default_1">on the rift, where her work began.</span>

05:50.808 --> 05:54.854
Just as Voltron was able to,
I will pilot us through the rift,

05:54.937 --> 05:57.315
and we will harvest
the unlimited quintessence

05:57.398 --> 06:00.860
that exists in the layer
between realities.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.780
I never doubted you, Lotor.

06:03.863 --> 06:07.325
<span style="style.default_1">So, we can just fly right through</span>
<span style="style.default_1">this thing to another reality?</span>

06:07.408 --> 06:09.786
[Lotor] <span style="style.default_1">I've not yet had</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a chance to test the gate.</span>

06:09.869 --> 06:14.624
<span style="style.default_1">My plans have been accelerated</span>
<span style="style.default_1">by our recent... turn of events.</span>

06:14.707 --> 06:17.376
But if my calculations are correct,

06:17.460 --> 06:20.797
by infusing our ships
with concentrated quintessence,

06:20.880 --> 06:24.884
we should be able to pierce
the barrier between realities.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.646
[beeping]

06:36.729 --> 06:39.732
Sir, this is all the concentrated
quintessence we have left.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.694
And I will use it to reap
an untold amount more.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.074
[static]

07:09.428 --> 07:11.639
Uh... did it work?

07:25.778 --> 07:29.031
We heard about the Voltron Coalition
against Zarkon.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.741
Yeah, we heard about you, too.

07:30.825 --> 07:33.202
Matt told us you've been helping
with the coalition forces.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.580
You guys really inspired all of us.

07:35.663 --> 07:36.914
-[electronic buzzing]
-Huh?

07:40.418 --> 07:41.669
[electronic buzzing]

07:43.921 --> 07:45.673
[electronic buzzing]

07:48.259 --> 07:51.429
-Oh, Beezer, I can't stay mad at you!
-[electronic buzzing]

07:52.680 --> 07:55.349
[Coran] All right, Princess,
it's time to begin the broadcast.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.226
Have we secured communications?

07:57.310 --> 08:01.022
Yes, Matt and I used
the rebel's transponder encryption.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.941
Always helps to have a pair
of tech-genius siblings around.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.506
Fellow members of the Voltron Coalition,

08:27.298 --> 08:29.008
<span style="style.default_1">if you are hearing me now,</span>

08:29.091 --> 08:32.511
<span style="style.default_1">it is because you have pledged</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us</span>

08:32.595 --> 08:36.974
<span style="style.default_1">in our fight against Zarkon's enslavement</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of the free peoples of the universe.</span>

08:38.351 --> 08:42.063
<span style="style.default_1">But that enslavement</span>
<span style="style.default_1">is about to be dealt a crushing blow.</span>

08:42.688 --> 08:47.318
<span style="style.default_1">The time for a full-scale attack</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on the Galra Empire is now.</span>

08:48.069 --> 08:50.988
<span style="style.default_1">Far in the future,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">when they speak of this day,</span>

08:51.072 --> 08:55.201
<span style="style.default_1">they will speak of our sacrifice,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">but they will also remember this</span>

08:55.284 --> 08:59.080
<span style="style.default_1">as the day that freedom</span>
<span style="style.default_1">began to overtake tyranny.</span>

08:59.830 --> 09:03.543
You all have your missions.
You know what to do.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.505
Good luck.
We'll see you on the other side.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.730
<span style="style.default_1">When you finish knocking out</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the communications hub,</span>

09:24.814 --> 09:26.274
<span style="style.default_1">meet us at the rendezvous point.</span>

09:26.357 --> 09:27.608
Copy that, Shiro.

09:27.692 --> 09:31.237
According to its trajectory, it passes
through the dark zone in five ticks.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.154
No pressure.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.282
-Four, three...
-Just the entire coalition rests on us

09:34.365 --> 09:36.909
-disabling this Galra comm station.
-...two, one.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.029

10:55.112 --> 10:57.907
Comm station hacked,
ghost signal initiated.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.576
Fully automated
so Galra HQ thinks it's running.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.037
We have about eight hours
before they figure it out.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.539
Until then, no calls get in or out.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.668
<span style="style.default_1">Coran will monitor it from the Castle</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so we know when it's back online.</span>

11:08.751 --> 11:09.877
<span style="style.default_1">Great work, guys.</span>

11:17.218 --> 11:21.180
Commander, we detect an entire fleet
of coalition ships entering the system.

11:21.263 --> 11:25.559
Very good. Arm defense systems
and prepare the main cannon.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.443
[beeping]

11:34.527 --> 11:37.113
[rapid beeping]

11:37.196 --> 11:41.117
-You guys ready for this?
-Ready as we'll ever be.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.745
<span style="style.default_1">All right, then.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">All ships form up and begin attack.</span>

11:53.921 --> 11:55.047
Here they come!

12:16.694 --> 12:19.447
We have to take out
those defensive turrets!

12:19.530 --> 12:21.198
Roger. Ribbit.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.669
Captain, there's no way
we can get through those shields!

12:33.752 --> 12:35.713
All crafts, pull back!

12:37.089 --> 12:41.343
-Commander, the main cannon is ready.
-Fire.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.521
[gasps, screams]

12:56.817 --> 12:59.278
Commander, the attack was successful.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.906
A third of the rebel forces
have been decimated.

13:01.989 --> 13:05.493
Good. Prepare for a second attack.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.997
Blades, we're in trouble!
What's the status of your cannon?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.249
<span style="style.default_1">Blades!</span>

13:12.333 --> 13:14.168
[Keith]
Copy, Olia. We're en route.

13:38.567 --> 13:42.071
Commander, I detect a large mass
entering Planet Naxzela's atmosphere.

13:42.154 --> 13:45.658
-It's not one of ours.
-Contact Galra HQ.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.994
All communications seem to be down.
Our alerts aren't getting through.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.956
-Activate cannon. We must defend--

14:04.093 --> 14:06.011
[rapid beeping]

14:06.095 --> 14:10.516
The Senfama Zaiforge cannon is ours.
Naxzela attack is under way.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.785
All right, Paladins, we've only got
one chance to take Naxzela,

15:11.869 --> 15:13.078
so let's make it count.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.462
We can't take this fire for long!

15:21.545 --> 15:24.381
See if the Blades can use their cannon
to take down the shield.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.426
-Copy that!
-We need to find cover, now!

15:28.886 --> 15:32.640
All ships form up
and get behind that large asteroid!

15:49.657 --> 15:52.076
The remaining rebel forces
are attempting to shield themselves

15:52.159 --> 15:53.994
behind that large asteroid.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.245
It won't work.

15:56.538 --> 16:00.000
Zaiforge cannon is in position.
Awaiting your orders.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.044
Fire.

16:08.550 --> 16:12.638

16:29.738 --> 16:31.448

17:01.395 --> 17:03.856
[grunting]
What's hitting us?

17:05.482 --> 17:07.984
We're in a minefield.
Somehow, the bombs were cloaked.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.528
Shield. Shield!

17:11.530 --> 17:13.615
[Pidge]
<span style="style.default_1">My systems are able to detect the mines,</span>

17:13.699 --> 17:16.452
<span style="style.default_1">but there's just too many</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to safely maneuver through them.</span>

17:16.535 --> 17:19.872
<span style="style.default_1">And, with the cruisers covering</span>
<span style="style.default_1">all possible exits from this minefield,</span>

17:19.954 --> 17:21.707
<span style="style.default_1">we have no way out!</span>

17:25.044 --> 17:28.297
Wait a tick.
Perhaps I can freeze the mines.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.549
Then we could fly out of here
before they explode.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.259
All right, that sounds like a plan.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.261
<span style="style.default_1">Freeze 'em, Allura!</span>

17:52.863 --> 17:53.906
[Shiro]
<span style="style.default_1">Let's move!</span>

17:57.242 --> 17:58.535
<span style="style.default_1">Form Voltron!</span>

18:00.412 --> 18:01.705
[roars]

18:33.862 --> 18:34.696
[roars]

18:50.838 --> 18:53.423
[Shiro]
<span style="style.default_1">Great work, team. Let's secure Naxzela.</span>

19:04.893 --> 19:08.063
Told you so. All Lotor's plans failed.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.108
He's gonna turn on us
as soon as it's in his best interest.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.068
We have to strike first.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.195
If we turn him over
to Galra Headquarters now,

19:15.279 --> 19:16.822
maybe they'll show us mercy.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.325
We gotta take him down.
It's our only chance.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.342
For Narti.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.847
[groaning]

19:41.930 --> 19:44.933
-Did you kill him?
-He's just stunned.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.603
Now, help me secure him.
Let's make this quick.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.985
[grunts]
Come on! Where is it?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.321
-[rapid beeping]
-Found you.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.990
Here goes nothin'.
[grunts]

20:24.348 --> 20:26.516
[all grunting]

20:40.530 --> 20:42.115
Shield's down, Captain!

20:42.199 --> 20:44.493
All right,
let's get control of that cannon!

20:50.415 --> 20:52.542
[rapid beeping]

20:52.626 --> 20:53.794
-Huh?
-[beeping stops]

20:53.877 --> 20:55.837
Zaiforge Cannon Base is ours!

20:56.421 --> 20:58.840
Ready to provide
the Taujeerians with cover.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.802
Cannon acquired.
Ready to provide backup.

21:01.885 --> 21:05.180
Copy that.
Coalition, you are clear to begin.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.659
We've almost taken the entire area!

21:26.535 --> 21:28.495
[groans, gasps]

21:29.204 --> 21:30.289
[sighs]

21:31.206 --> 21:32.374
[groans]

21:33.208 --> 21:36.169
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?

21:36.878 --> 21:40.966
I'm sorry, sir. Nothing personal.
This is our only way out.

21:41.049 --> 21:45.137
<span style="style.default_1">You plan to give me up.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I understand, Zethrid.</span>

21:45.637 --> 21:49.558
You do what you must,
and I'll do what I must.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.893
-[bones cracking]
-[grunting]

21:52.436 --> 21:54.730
-[rapid beeping]
-What the--? [grunts]

22:09.328 --> 22:13.206
Well, there goes our bargaining chip.
We're as dead as Lotor.

22:15.625 --> 22:19.296
-[Ezor] <span style="style.default_1">What do we do now?</span>
-There's still one option left.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.384
-[rapid beeping]
<span style="style.default_1">-Quiznak!</span>

22:24.468 --> 22:26.595
The communications satellite
is back online.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.847
Galra distress calls are going through!

22:28.930 --> 22:31.058
[Shiro] <span style="style.default_1">It doesn't matter, Coran.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">They're too late.</span>

22:31.141 --> 22:33.101
<span style="style.default_1"> We've just about secured Naxzela.</span>

22:37.064 --> 22:38.648
Naxzela is under attack.

22:38.732 --> 22:42.569
Voltron and the coalition just reclaimed
an entire section of the empire.

22:44.529 --> 22:45.489
Good.
