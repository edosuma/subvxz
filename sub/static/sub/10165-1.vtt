MORAL

00:18.760 --> 00:20.398
Do you know what moral is?

00:22.160 --> 00:23.832
Let me tell you.

00:24.520 --> 00:28.832
Moral is for the people
that own it, for the rich.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.433
And who's always right?

00:33.640 --> 00:37.030
The rich. And the poor are screwed.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.839
JUSTICE

00:41.480 --> 00:44.040
Shall I show you my moral?

00:46.720 --> 00:49.553
Won't you be sorry?
- I'm not sure.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.594
I think you'll be afraid.
This is my moral.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.831
There's the moral.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.959
Do you know why I have this?

01:01.440 --> 01:06.560
Because mr moral there in his uniform...

01:07.320 --> 01:11.233
always wins...

01:11.440 --> 01:13.908
Him and his damn moral.

01:14.120 --> 01:18.113
And I...
This is my justice.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.076
Whether you're right...

01:24.720 --> 01:26.631
...or wrong...

01:26.840 --> 01:29.479
it doesn't matter man.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.589
Les Cinemas de la Zone present:

01:38.800 --> 01:42.759
the drama of a butcher alone
in the guts of his land.

01:45.400 --> 01:50.235
Everyone his own life, everyone his moral.
If I would summarize my life...

01:50.440 --> 01:55.116
My life is like that of a loser.
They should write that down.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.675
The story of man
like so many others.

01:57.880 --> 02:01.316
It all started in France,
land of cheese and traitors.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.829
The man was born near Paris
in 1939.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.555
In 1941 his mother abandoned him.
He has never seen her again.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.433
On liberation day the boy
finds out who his father is.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.234
A communist who died
in one of the concentration camps.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.432
He's six years old now.
His mental struggle begins.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.519
His innocence was stolen from him
in the name of Jesus as he was raised.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.554
To be able to survive the boy
becomes a butcher at 14.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.115
The next 10 years he works
for various people...

02:27.320 --> 02:30.630
...saving every cent
for his own business.

02:30.840 --> 02:34.753
Which he gets when he's 30.
It's difficult at first...

02:34.960 --> 02:37.394
...but after two years
the shop is running well.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.672
Well he makes a living out of it.
He meets a young factory worker...

02:40.880 --> 02:44.839
...and takes her virginity from her in
the l'Avenir Hotel across from the factory.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.917
From there on it goes fast.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.636
Nine months later he will be father of
Cynthia, a baby unwanted by the mother.

02:51.840 --> 02:55.310
He is once again abandoned and is
left to bring up his daughter alone.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.034
Years pass by.
The shop is fine.

02:58.240 --> 03:03.109
The butcher buys an apartment
where the daughter grows up to be mute.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.390
Her adolescence starts.
She's becoming a woman.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.309
The father, still single
has to fight his lust.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.956
That's when fate strikes.
The girl has her first period.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.072
In unknown pain
she runs off to the shop.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.033
On the way there a worker tries
to seduce her.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.310
A neighbour sees it happen
and takes her to her father.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.308
The father sees the blood on her skirt
and thinks she's been raped.

03:25.520 --> 03:28.034
He gets a knife
and goes to find the rapist.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.832
The man sees a worker on a dock

03:30.040 --> 03:33.032
The butcher slashes the man's
face with the knife.

03:33.240 --> 03:37.756
The butcher goes to jail for that.
The girl is put in an institution.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.996
The father occasionally writes
his daughter. Months pass.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.556
The butcher has to sell the apartment
and the butcher shop.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.320
Finally the butcher is free again
but without any possessions.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.193
To survive the man
becomes a bartender.

03:49.400 --> 03:53.712
He soon becomes his boss's lover. She
gets pregnant and want to sell the bar...

03:53.920 --> 03:55.751
...to start a new life
in an other town.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.396
She even has enough money
to rent a butcher shop.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.158
The man has no choice.

04:01.360 --> 04:04.033
For the first time he visits
his daughter.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.959
He tells her goodbye.
She sees him leave but says nothing.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.277
The next day the man drives out of
Paris with his wife...

04:10.480 --> 04:14.189
...hoping to escape the dark tunnel
that is his life.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.834
In Lille they move in with
the woman's mother...

04:17.040 --> 04:18.791
...until they find a house and a shop.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.233
Compared to Paris the streets
up North seem abandoned and grey.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.908
For the first time the man
feels like a stranger.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.033
He sees projections of his
dead father.

04:31.240 --> 04:35.074
But the butcher is like everyone else
A being that wants to survive.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.875
He then decides to forget about his past
and betrayal of his daughter.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.834
Just like his love for her. Well,
love is a bit too strong.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.874
Not many people can say
they have truly known love.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.557
So this man is me.
This has been my life so far.

04:51.760 --> 04:56.038
But today starts my new life.
I'm starting all over again.

04:56.240 --> 05:00.836
Yes ladies and gentlemen.
Today I'm erasing my past.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.798
Suburban Lille, Northern France
January 3rd, 1980

05:31.760 --> 05:35.275
Good night children.
- Good night mum.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.711
Excuse me.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.880
That's the side my father used
to sleep on.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.911
Aren't you warm enough already?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.111
She'd better keep calm.
Her and her kid.

06:12.320 --> 06:17.917
If she keeps nagging like this
I'll blow her head off. Well not just her head.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.759
Are we going to have a look
at the shop tomorrow?

06:30.640 --> 06:31.914
Yeah.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.196
Yeah I like it.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.510
But it's a bit expensive.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.991
The transaction has to be
10 percent cheaper.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.398
And so does the rent.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.154
On your account?

07:08.360 --> 07:10.874
No. On mine

07:19.640 --> 07:21.392
It was a bad place.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.114
I'd rather keep my money
until after the pregnancy.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.437
That wasn't what we agreed on.
What will we do until then?

07:27.640 --> 07:30.518
You can take up a temporary job.
Come on.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.833
Thanks.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.879
''Wanted: pork butcher''

07:38.080 --> 07:40.514
Look. They're looking for a butcher.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.870
I'm not a pork butcher.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.474
It'll be easier than having a shop.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.078
Yes, you're right.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.358
What are you doing?

07:56.560 --> 08:01.759
I don't feel like it. It's my money.
I'm pregnant and you can shut up.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.438
Exactly.

08:09.880 --> 08:15.159
Damn sausage. Damn wine.
Damn family in a boring city.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.393
It's all turned out to be very nice.
A new shop.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.591
A nice new life.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.956
But filthy as they are...

08:23.160 --> 08:27.551
...I wouldn't be surprised
when the inspection would drop by.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.151
It's what happens when one gets old.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.909
Lose your sense of smell and sight,
and get dirty.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.553
But that fat cow has
no excuse.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.111
And are your parents still alive.?

08:42.559 --> 08:45.199
I told you he is an orphan.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.277
Oh, sorry.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.235
You should smile.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.837
Do you understand?

09:07.320 --> 09:10.278
To get the customers to buy a lot.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.799
We're in a supermarket,
with music and everything.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.829
Everyone should feel comfortable.
You see?

09:20.800 --> 09:22.791
Just smile for me.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.155
Put some effort in it. Smile.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.588
Forget it. Just go.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.672
Come on.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.399
Fool.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.710
Coming here and beg for a job.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.872
What? You could be a pork butcher?

09:53.120 --> 09:55.588
What did you think? That you could
sit in front of the TV forever?

09:55.800 --> 10:00.476
If you weren't so stingy we'd
already have the store.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.830
So shut up.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.598
To win in Roubaix you'd have to
be in top shape.

10:12.800 --> 10:18.113
And you'd have to know where to
ride.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.517
You shouldn't go along
with the anonymous hurd.

10:23.520 --> 10:27.911
He's here. My son in law.
Doctor Choukroune.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.751
We were just talking
about your problems.

10:30.960 --> 10:35.670
They're looking for a night guard 
at the old people's home where he works.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.513
Your mother-in-law explained
everything to me.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.188
If this can't help you...

10:46.760 --> 10:50.196
I'll give you the number and address
of the home...

10:50.400 --> 10:53.392
...so you can contact them.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.234
Goodbye sir.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.551
Right, the tart thinks I'm the guard
at an old people's home.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.832
Shall I wipe her ass too
while I'm at it?

11:12.600 --> 11:17.310
On the other hand... If I work at night
I won't have to see their ugly mugs.

11:18.120 --> 11:22.033
Have you done night-time work before?
- Not really.

11:22.240 --> 11:26.597
It may seem easy but after a while
it could drive you insane.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.557
Have you worked in a home before?

11:38.760 --> 11:40.352
I took a dump.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.676
Actually it's not that much fun.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.956
It's strange you know, you think it's
going to be over for them soon...

11:50.160 --> 11:53.789
...but the things that
happen behind those doors...

11:54.280 --> 11:57.636
Well, you'll see.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.675
This is your office.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.112
I've been here for 2 weeks now.

12:17.320 --> 12:21.233
I haven't felt this good since
I got out of prison.

12:21.440 --> 12:26.673
This place isn't worse than jail.
On the contrary. Except for the stench.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.637
Old people smell terrible.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.558
- Old people's home Debussy
March 18 1980, 4 AM -

12:32.760 --> 12:37.356
I can't stand those
two old bags in their flat.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.798
They shouldn't think I'm
a wimp.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.673
But the old cow's rich...

12:43.880 --> 12:47.793
...and she thinks because of
that she can do anything.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.798
That's how it is.
Everyone's fighting for their money...

12:51.000 --> 12:54.072
...and their steak.
And no one will do it for you.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.792
Have you been to the doctor's?
- No.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.357
A woman is choking.
Can you help me. Quick.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.791
Yeah, I don't know...

13:21.800 --> 13:23.392
Quick.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.236
Hold her hand.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.793
Daddy...

14:27.720 --> 14:33.431
Don't leave me alone.

14:43.240 --> 14:47.392
Everything's all dark.

15:09.840 --> 15:14.436
Death opens no doors.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.634
In the end death is nothing special.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.510
Everyone makes a big deal out of it.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.951
But from a close view
It's nothing serious.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.958
A lifeless body, that's all.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.077
People are just like animals.

15:32.280 --> 15:35.477
You love them,
you bury them, that's it.

15:36.120 --> 15:39.669
Even thought this is the
first time I see it.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.189
Evidently it's her first time too.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.915
She sure looks devastated.

15:48.040 --> 15:51.350
While it's so damn boring.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.313
Ok, I'll take her home.

15:57.720 --> 16:01.998
She sure looks fragile.
And pretty cute, too.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.674
Let me walk you home.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.394
She reminds me of my daughter.

16:17.440 --> 16:18.953
My Cynthia.

16:19.160 --> 16:21.958
She must be very lonely
wherever she is now.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.358
Come.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.640
But loneliness means nothing.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.873
Living with a guy or a girl
or even with kids...

16:37.320 --> 16:39.550
...but you're still alone.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.071
I'm alone.
And so is she.

16:44.400 --> 16:48.473
We are born alone,
live our lives alone and die alone.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.518
Alone, forever alone.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.915
Even when fucking we're alone.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.190
Alone with our body
Alone with our life...

16:56.400 --> 16:59.312
...which is like a tunnel,
impossible to share.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.956
Over the years it only gets worse...

17:03.200 --> 17:07.159
...only leaving memories of a life
that's slowly deteriorating.

17:10.040 --> 17:13.271
Look, Mrs Fabienne.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.996
What is she doing here?

17:17.680 --> 17:19.875
Damn, we're there already.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.156
Strange... whenever I like a girl,
I mess it up.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.830
Even when they want me.
She definitely does.

17:33.040 --> 17:37.397
But I bet she has a boyfriend.
All girls have boyfriends somewhere.

17:37.720 --> 17:41.508
Life is a tunnel. Everyone has his
own little tunnel.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.359
Only there is no light at the end.

17:44.560 --> 17:48.553
It is a void.
Even memories will be gone.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.236
The old people do know this.
They live a simple life...

17:52.440 --> 17:55.113
...they have small pensions
and a small grave.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.278
And it's all completely useless.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.277
Even having children.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.359
When you're old and poor
they will put you in a home...

18:04.560 --> 18:06.835
...to let you suffer in silence.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.237
They don't care.
They don't love their parents.

18:10.440 --> 18:14.877
It's a myth. You only love your
mother when she feeds you.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.753
And your father when he gives you money.

18:18.280 --> 18:21.352
Once her breasts are all
dried out...

18:21.640 --> 18:26.031
...or when your father's pockets
are empty, better put them away...

18:26.240 --> 18:30.153
...and hope they'll die a
quick and cheap death.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.508
It's the law of life.

18:33.720 --> 18:38.077
Only when there's an inheritance
the children pretend to be nice.

18:38.280 --> 18:42.751
But for a fridge or TV there is,
no need to play nice guy.

18:42.960 --> 18:46.396
Maybe just the bare minimum,
for ease of mind.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.352
Call them every other month...

18:48.560 --> 18:52.235
...a couple of tears at the funeral
and you've done your duty.

18:52.440 --> 18:55.830
Love and friendship. It's all
full of shit

18:56.040 --> 18:58.918
Illusions from your youth...
to cover up the fact...

18:59.120 --> 19:03.477
that all human relationships
are redundant.

19:03.680 --> 19:07.719
Sure friendship and love are useful,
only when they're beneficiary .

19:07.920 --> 19:10.434
Reality is much more corrupted.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.269
You love your mother because she
feeds you so you stay alive.

19:14.480 --> 19:18.871
Your friend because he helps you get
a job so you stay alive.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.152
Your wife because she cooks for you
and relieves you of your sperm...

19:22.400 --> 19:25.756
...and gives you children
to look after you when you're old...

19:25.960 --> 19:27.791
...and afraid to die.

19:29.160 --> 19:33.358
But punish your child once
and it'll retaliate when you're old.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.711
The punishment...

19:35.920 --> 19:38.912
...will be their tool.
When they put you in a home...

19:39.120 --> 19:42.317
...that will be their excuse to
hide their disinterest...

19:42.520 --> 19:46.035
...that we all have
towards our up bringers.

19:47.160 --> 19:51.915
No, I don't like the baby they're
trying to let me have.

19:53.880 --> 19:57.156
And I'm sure the baby
will think the same.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.673
No, fucking is definitely
misunderstood.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.950
It's even damn expensive.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.116
But well, it's a pastime.

20:07.320 --> 20:11.791
When you don't want to fuck no more
that's when you know your time is up.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.834
And that it's all been the
same in this life.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.392
Merely a reproduction code
that's been imprinted on us...

20:20.600 --> 20:23.398
...that we think we should obey.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.879
Thanks.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.997
Being born against your will. Eat.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.636
Wave your dick around.
Make new life. Die.

20:35.040 --> 20:39.079
Life is one big void. It's always been
and it'll always be.

20:39.280 --> 20:43.432
A large void that can do
just fine without me.

20:45.480 --> 20:49.837
I don't want to play that game
anymore. not in this life.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.636
I want to experience something personal,
something intense.

20:54.840 --> 20:59.356
I don't want to be the final replaceable
part of a giant machine.

20:59.640 --> 21:03.519
The day I die I want to
have done more...

21:03.720 --> 21:07.429
...than the shit millions of fuckers
have done together.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.949
Look at it like this...

21:10.160 --> 21:13.835
...every sucker's done the same things
that I did.

21:14.280 --> 21:18.068
I don't know.
I must find a reason...

21:18.320 --> 21:21.835
...an excuse or what ever
to find the motivation...

21:22.040 --> 21:24.679
...to go on another 20 years.
Until I die.

21:25.720 --> 21:31.078
Should I start my life all over
I'd want to make porn movies.

21:31.280 --> 21:35.114
It's all clear.
The people who do that...

21:35.320 --> 21:37.629
...understand the human race.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.638
Either you're born with a cock
which has to be...

21:40.840 --> 21:44.037
...a big hard dick
filling snatches.

21:44.240 --> 21:50.349
Or you're born with a pussy
which has to be filled with cock.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.514
In both scenarios you'll still be alone.

21:53.760 --> 21:57.912
Yeah, I'm a dick.
That's it.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.830
I'm a sad, sad dick...

22:01.120 --> 22:06.399
...and to earn some respect
I must be hard all the time.

22:07.840 --> 22:11.355
But with the fat cow
I can't do it anymore.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.637
I'd rather take
the old tart.

22:14.840 --> 22:19.072
Or a threesome.
Me, Mother, Daughter.

22:19.280 --> 22:23.239
I bet they'd like it too,
those perverted sluts.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.796
Both getting a good fucking
on daddy's bed.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.595
Cow would freak out.

22:31.120 --> 22:36.035
Tower complex Pablo Picasso
That night around 10:30 PM

23:02.360 --> 23:03.952
Where the hell have you been?

23:04.160 --> 23:06.310
So have you fucked her?

23:06.560 --> 23:09.472
Have you fucked her?
- What?

23:09.680 --> 23:11.875
Do I need to spell it out?

23:13.480 --> 23:16.472
What did Fabienne tell me?

23:16.680 --> 23:19.399
She's seen you this morning
together with some slut.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.068
I haven't done anything.
- Oh haven't you?

23:22.320 --> 23:24.436
I didn't feel like returning
to this hell hole.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.837
Well off you go then. Fuck off.
- I certainly will.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.793
Fine. I'll finally have my
child to myself.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.157
Turning him into a queer.
- Like his daddy.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.588
Faggot.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.394
What did you call me?
- Half faggot.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.593
Stupid bitch. Take that.
- You're a stupid bitch yourself.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.360
What?
- You're a stupid bitch yourself.

23:45.560 --> 23:49.678
I'm going to hit you in the fucking
face stupid old bitch.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.434
Piece of shit!

24:08.880 --> 24:11.599
I'm getting the gun.
- What?

24:11.800 --> 24:14.189
The gun.
- What gun?

24:15.960 --> 24:18.110
Where did you get a gun?
- My husband.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.038
Where's that gun?

24:20.520 --> 24:22.636
Where is it?
- Over there.

24:22.840 --> 24:26.594
Where, over there?
- Over there in the closet.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.438
What closet?

24:29.880 --> 24:31.836
The small one?
- Yes.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.116
Bitch.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.758
Mama...

24:40.960 --> 24:42.712
My baby...

24:43.840 --> 24:45.831
My baby, mama.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.158
I don't have it.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.797
He killed my baby.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.996
I'm calling the police.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.429
That bitch. She's sneaky.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.234
Really sneaky.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.558
Keep calm. Calm, calm.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.638
I have to get out of this
damn place.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.156
My baby, mama.

25:21.360 --> 25:26.070
What baby, your baby's nothing
but a meatball. Meat.

25:27.160 --> 25:31.039
At least he should be lucky not
to see your god damn face.

25:31.240 --> 25:35.677
My baby... my baby...

25:44.520 --> 25:47.876
Mama, my baby...

25:51.400 --> 25:54.676
Asshole! Fucker! Son of a bitch!

26:12.760 --> 26:15.957
Those bitches are crazy enough to
call the cops.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.196
Maybe they already have.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.710
After my beating she's probably
shitting out the foetus on the carpet.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.275
That could mean trouble.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.631
I have no idea how many years
they'd give me for that.

26:27.840 --> 26:32.231
She could call it murder,
even when she started it.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.319
Dammit. What should I do now?

26:35.520 --> 26:38.398
Not that I feel sorry.
The kid is better off dead...

26:38.600 --> 26:40.909
...than being stuck with
those two.

26:41.120 --> 26:44.192
I bet the cow's going to be sick.

26:44.960 --> 26:48.191
Yeah. I better not go back.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.799
Not tonight. Never again

26:50.000 --> 26:53.834
It's over.
I'm better off on my own...

26:54.040 --> 26:56.349
...than to have to see those two.

26:56.560 --> 27:00.439
I'm not responsible for
all the misery in the world.

27:00.640 --> 27:04.838
No. I'm starting all over,
alone, in Paris.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.799
If it means I'll have to be an asshole
that's how it is then.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.991
A downright asshole.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.158
I can do it.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.916
It's the only way to win.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.916
I've lost too much damn time.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.029
Besides I have a gun now.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.560
I hope you like good music.

28:50.240 --> 28:53.755
I'll take you along to Northern Paris.
Okay?

29:01.880 --> 29:04.189
Damn Paris can be dull...

29:04.440 --> 29:07.273
...but the rest's even worse.

29:07.560 --> 29:10.950
How can people live in such
a place for their entire lives?

29:11.240 --> 29:14.755
Those peasants are probably
totally different from me.

29:20.720 --> 29:24.599
Okay. Yet another chapter in the
life of our poor man.

29:24.800 --> 29:28.713
How he got out of two
spiders' webs.

29:29.520 --> 29:33.229
I feel better already.
Left all that crap behind now.

29:33.720 --> 29:36.951
I don't know how to survive
on just 300 Francs.

29:37.160 --> 29:40.948
First I need shelter.
Besides, I've got friends.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.037
Well I have to see about that.

29:43.240 --> 29:47.233
At least I'm around
real people again.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.795
Somehow I get the lucky feeling
I should go with my instincts.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.753
Have to be careful not
to run into the police.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.430
I bet the cow's playing
poor old casualty by now.

29:58.640 --> 30:03.077
She might have told some of my
Parisian friends even.

30:03.280 --> 30:06.078
Yeah, I'll have to watch my step.

30:06.280 --> 30:09.556
At least the police will
never find me here.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.879
I was in a nightclub.
There she was. We looked at each other.

30:15.080 --> 30:18.356
Could you give me the room on 2nd floor
the one with a view of the street?

30:18.560 --> 30:22.109
Have you been here before?
- Fifteen years ago.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.678
Room number 26.

30:26.280 --> 30:30.319
60 Francs a night. Paid in advance.

30:30.520 --> 30:34.399
After that you pay me 60 Francs for
each additional night.

30:34.600 --> 30:39.720
...I could eat her up.
I couldn't stop.

30:39.920 --> 30:43.595
She started banging and wanking.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.439
I went at it like a raging bull.

30:46.640 --> 30:51.191
And she screamed. I fucked her to pieces.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.914
An incredible evening.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.712
Your room, Sir.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.675
So I'll pay for tonight...

31:15.880 --> 31:18.189
And we'll see about tomorrow.

31:24.880 --> 31:27.075
Very well.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.718
It's strange to be back
in this room again.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.192
Standing in front of the bed
my daughter was made in.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.948
Her mum sure was a fine shag.

31:49.160 --> 31:52.277
If I'd known that she'd
abandon me and the girl...

31:52.480 --> 31:55.233
...I wouldn't have popped.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.831
But there's no way back. I blew
my load and now I have a daughter.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.758
Even though her mother is dead...

32:01.960 --> 32:06.033
...I still have my memories
of all the afternoons on this bed.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.719
A real woman is beautiful.

32:07.920 --> 32:11.230
But most of them are cranky
because they don't have a cock.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.271
For fuck's sake...

32:13.480 --> 32:16.995
...the woman left me and the kid
for a Portuguese guy.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.078
Women can be so damn pitiful.

32:20.560 --> 32:24.439
Because they don't have a dick
they feel superior to men...

32:24.640 --> 32:29.714
...when betraying him with another
cock. Especially when he's richer.

32:29.920 --> 32:32.718
After having shagged her...

32:32.920 --> 32:36.390
...the prince threw her out
like rotten cheese.

32:37.280 --> 32:41.637
She'd been mean, but clever enough
to realize that she had.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.796
The past always retaliates.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.275
You always pay for what you've done.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.438
And if she threw herself in front of
the subway

32:50.280 --> 32:52.157
...I couldn't help it.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.550
She got what she deserved.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.474
Jesus Christ, being broke isn't easy.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.240
But having no one to rely on
that's what's really harsh.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.795
The less you have,
the more you are ignored.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.596
I can always tell them I'm a father,
that I had my own shop. That I'm a good person.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.678
The hotel owner,
my so-called friend...

33:10.880 --> 33:13.553
...the bartender,
they don't care.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.797
When they see you're broke
they just kick you out.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.753
In the most humiliating way.

33:19.960 --> 33:22.679
Instead of helping a guy out
of his troubles...

33:22.880 --> 33:27.715
...they kiss some rich man's ass
and hope for some money.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.593
That's why they're always
talking bullshit

33:30.800 --> 33:32.916
I'd rather be poor and honest.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.476
Someone please give me a job
so I can buy my steak.

33:36.680 --> 33:42.198
Other than that leave me alone.
Not exactly happiness but it'll do.

33:42.480 --> 33:46.075
How stupid of me to visit
on closing day.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.073
I wonder who I can mooch off next...

33:53.720 --> 33:57.190
No I won't do it.
I won't lower my standards to begging.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.279
Need to have some self respect.

34:00.840 --> 34:03.957
I could always sell the gun tomorrow

34:04.200 --> 34:07.033
Should be good for 200 to 300 Francs.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.958
Morning. A cup of coffee please.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.710
Can I have a cup of coffee please?

34:22.400 --> 34:24.550
For mint tea try across from here.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.989
I didn't ask for mint tea.

34:28.800 --> 34:33.315
Didn't get my supply today.
- You've already served some people.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.831
I just told you I didn't
get my supply today.

34:38.239 --> 34:40.310
How stupid.

34:41.120 --> 34:46.114
You've just told me you didn't get
your delivery but did serve some.

34:46.639 --> 34:52.237
Be polite. You're here at my place.
-I am being polite.

34:52.440 --> 34:56.717
And I'm not at your place, I'm at a bar.
Please serve me.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.593
Listen, I de respect you.
- You have to serve me.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.995
Don't give me trouble.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.794
Get your brown ass out of here.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.717
You should go back and see...

35:10.960 --> 35:13.190
your old butcher shop.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.879
Why?

35:15.080 --> 35:18.470
Well, the Arab's fantastic.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.596
The shop's always full.
Sometimes he can't serve everyone.

35:25.360 --> 35:32.232
To think about how your life changed.
You were pretty good.

35:32.440 --> 35:35.671
How come you ended up like this?

35:36.760 --> 35:38.796
You look terrible.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.629
Yeah.
- Well that's easy: I don't have a job.

35:43.320 --> 35:47.711
Too bad. And it'll only get worse.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.869
Thanks a lot.

35:52.800 --> 35:57.157
Let me tell you what to do.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.395
Go to the employment office.

36:05.840 --> 36:09.469
You look kind of pale to me.

36:09.680 --> 36:15.357
Unless you want to end up
in the gutter...

36:15.840 --> 36:20.868
...you'll have to do something.
Get a grip on life again.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.590
What kind of work would you like?
- I'm a butcher.

36:26.840 --> 36:30.753
We have no butcher work right now.
- What about pork butchers?

36:30.960 --> 36:32.791
Same situation.

36:34.480 --> 36:36.869
Please come back again in a while.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.153
Thanks.

37:02.160 --> 37:05.869
You... I'm sure
you like to have fun.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.514
of course.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.672
well...

37:16.680 --> 37:18.750
wait...

37:21.480 --> 37:23.755
I'll take you somewhere.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.516
What does that guy want?

37:42.080 --> 37:46.232
Is he a fag or just jealous
that she wants my dick?

37:47.120 --> 37:52.274
Why not. She's not my type
but I can't refuse.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.909
She looks young. And hot.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.637
I hope I can get it up.
If not...

38:02.920 --> 38:06.515
...I can always say that it's
because I'm a sentimental guy.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.594
What's going on?

38:15.800 --> 38:19.429
I've beaten up little
sluts before.

38:21.640 --> 38:25.428
It's an exchange, you know?

38:26.600 --> 38:30.878
I mean... I'm going to give you energy.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.350
And warmth.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.672
It's an exchange
of fluids...

38:38.880 --> 38:45.035
Even though our energy
has a different colour...

38:45.360 --> 38:50.354
You're not going to give me money.
Are you?

38:55.040 --> 38:59.955
Am I right? Yeah?
You're going to give me energy.

39:00.160 --> 39:02.993
Because I'll give you energy.

39:09.400 --> 39:12.119
Do you agree?

39:13.200 --> 39:15.350
You do agree, right?

39:15.600 --> 39:17.875
Show me your arm.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.195
You feel nice.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.314
Look, I'm getting hard.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.392
Papa...

39:49.360 --> 39:51.999
You won't hurt me, will you?

39:53.080 --> 39:54.877
Come.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.156
Yes, come.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.071
If she had let me have my way.

40:26.680 --> 40:30.434
But no. Complete misery.

40:32.200 --> 40:33.792
A bitch.

40:34.080 --> 40:35.991
They're all the same.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.276
Same position,
same scene, same stench.

40:40.520 --> 40:43.478
And I've even paid for it.

40:44.280 --> 40:47.272
This is not good, butcher man.
This is not good at all.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.550
Wake up. Quick.

40:49.960 --> 40:53.714
I'm going to look up old Roland.
He's always been my best customer.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.555
I hope he hasn't retired.
He always wanted to.

40:57.760 --> 41:01.355
I bet good old Roland's
saved some money.

41:01.560 --> 41:05.519
I hope that slut hasn't
given me an STD .

41:05.720 --> 41:08.188
That's the only thing missing,
a dick covered in pus.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.392
Last time was in the army
thank god.

41:11.960 --> 41:16.397
No I can't.
It's always this or that.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.034
We can't live like this.

41:19.480 --> 41:22.358
But he's a friend isn't he?

41:22.560 --> 41:26.712
He is. But there are more
friends in the world.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.559
Especially when they ask for favours.

41:30.680 --> 41:33.956
That's life.
- Tell him I dropped by.

41:34.160 --> 41:37.914
I will.
But I don't know if he'll be happy.

41:39.080 --> 41:44.108
You've come at a bad time.
I cannot help you with money.

41:44.320 --> 41:47.869
Not even 200 Francs?
- Want me to empty my pockets?

41:48.080 --> 41:49.354
No, don't.

41:49.560 --> 41:54.680
I can give you some food though.
- No thanks.

41:54.880 --> 41:58.953
I can give you a place to sleep
every now and then.

41:59.960 --> 42:02.918
If you want. One or two days.

42:04.680 --> 42:06.113
I'll be fine.

42:06.320 --> 42:09.471
I'm really broke you know.

42:09.680 --> 42:13.229
I loaned some money from a guy who
was like a son to me.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.795
He hasn't given it back yet.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.356
Worst of all I'm on welfare.

42:20.080 --> 42:23.550
I can't afford to be in a home.

42:25.480 --> 42:29.758
You know what I'm like.
I'd do it if I could.

42:31.120 --> 42:35.113
But feel free to drop by any time.
If you want.

42:35.840 --> 42:38.434
You'll always get some bread.

42:40.280 --> 42:42.589
How's your daughter?

42:45.520 --> 42:47.033
Fine.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.912
Yeah, ok.

42:53.560 --> 42:56.120
You have to fight for her.

42:56.760 --> 43:02.392
I've always lived like this.
I've always struggled.

43:06.480 --> 43:11.031
I don't have much.
Like I said, welfare.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.514
Feel free to drop by any time.

43:19.360 --> 43:22.352
There'll always be a piece of
bread for you.

43:30.880 --> 43:34.350
Life is a battle, each and every day.

43:35.400 --> 43:38.676
You must fight. And show stamina.

43:39.720 --> 43:41.836
Keep this in mind.

43:44.200 --> 43:46.839
It's the same for me. I fight.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.236
Like I've always done.

43:55.240 --> 43:57.071
Try and get your way out of it.

43:57.640 --> 44:01.679
You're like me.
Burn under an unlucky star.

44:01.880 --> 44:05.759
There's rich people and there's poor people.
The poor people have to suffer.

44:06.040 --> 44:08.600
We're part of the poor.

44:09.360 --> 44:12.989
Please visit me again,
I'd like it.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.676
I hope it will be under better
circumstances.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.232
Yeah. Just about enough for a sandwich.
And still.

44:44.480 --> 44:47.836
Ham or cheese. Not both.
And no butter.

44:49.240 --> 44:51.071
It's hot in here.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.956
What am I to do tomorrow?

44:54.240 --> 44:57.755
I can't beg.
Not at my age.

44:58.960 --> 45:01.349
And certainly not in my neighbourhood

45:01.840 --> 45:04.274
Ah I love my country.

45:04.480 --> 45:05.754
France.

45:05.960 --> 45:09.953
Poor France. Struck
by all misery in the world.

45:10.160 --> 45:15.280
No more factories, no more work.
Only ruins and jobless people.

45:16.560 --> 45:20.519
Damn, I'm hungry.
Not a shop in sight.

45:20.840 --> 45:25.118
Not in a mile from here either.
Might as well stay here.

45:25.360 --> 45:27.954
Save me some money
for food tomorrow.

45:28.800 --> 45:32.554
I'd better go to sleep.
When asleep one forgets his hunger.

45:32.760 --> 45:35.558
Maybe I won't even be hungry
tomorrow.

45:36.920 --> 45:39.832
Sorry, I'm having some problems
running the store.

45:40.120 --> 45:43.510
I'm nearly bankrupt.
Try Antoine's.

45:43.720 --> 45:46.473
Maybe he can help.

45:47.200 --> 45:50.749
I can't do anything for you.
All I can do is give you a steak.

45:51.800 --> 45:54.189
I can't hire you.

45:58.400 --> 46:02.188
What if you...
- No, I can't help you.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.948
But you know the abattoir's 
director.

46:06.160 --> 46:09.630
France Chevaline?
- Yes, go ask at the abattoir.

46:12.920 --> 46:17.232
It's terrible.
There's no work to be done.

46:17.480 --> 46:19.072
We hardly sell anything.

46:19.280 --> 46:21.840
I just had to fire someone.

46:22.040 --> 46:25.589
I couldn't afford keeping him.
We're in a crisis.

46:27.320 --> 46:29.072
Listen...

46:30.400 --> 46:33.073
I hate to ask...

46:33.520 --> 46:38.435
but can you loan me some money?
For a couple of days. Until I find work.

46:39.200 --> 46:42.749
I'm a month behind on the pay checks.
A month!

46:44.760 --> 46:47.558
Can you imagine?

46:51.160 --> 46:54.436
The abattoir was looking for people.
Give it a go.

46:54.640 --> 46:57.279
Try it. Go and see them.

47:29.080 --> 47:35.997
Life is so damn selfish.

47:36.800 --> 47:44.150
Surviving is a genetic law.

47:49.200 --> 47:53.591
It's not right to ask my former
supplier for a job.

47:56.080 --> 48:00.198
Especially if I open up a
store myself later.

48:00.400 --> 48:03.278
Well, that's hardly likely.

48:06.040 --> 48:11.637
Ah it's the least they can do for
me after everything I bought from them.

48:12.360 --> 48:15.397
I think the director liked me.

48:19.480 --> 48:23.758
Even though being nice to one's customers
doesn't mean that much.

48:25.800 --> 48:30.396
In case there is work for me they would
prefer a butcher like me.

48:30.760 --> 48:35.231
I hope he won't ask about the
Arab that took over my store.

48:44.480 --> 48:47.950
When will you pay for the room?
- I'm going to get money.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.752
Dammit.

48:49.960 --> 48:53.316
I'll blow his brains out
if he doesn't stop.

48:55.120 --> 48:57.588
What? It's nothing to be ashamed of.

48:57.800 --> 49:00.758
I have nothing to lose.
I'll go all the way.

49:00.960 --> 49:04.111
I'll do it for the money.
Killing horses may not be...

49:04.320 --> 49:08.393
...exactly much fun,
but it relieves me.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.514
Yeah.

49:10.720 --> 49:13.234
A good steak is what I need.

49:17.440 --> 49:21.638
We've met before.
I used to be a customer, remember?

49:22.160 --> 49:24.196
And you went bankrupt.

49:25.280 --> 49:26.918
Yes.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.191
But anyways...

49:30.400 --> 49:34.393
butchering horses is easier
than running a butcher shop.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.990
That's partly true.
Listen.

49:38.200 --> 49:42.671
We might need some butchers later.
Have you filled out the forms?

49:42.880 --> 49:44.359
Yes I have.

49:45.080 --> 49:48.470
I don't see your age.
- Fifty.

49:51.240 --> 49:54.198
Good. Do you have a record?

49:54.720 --> 49:56.597
Yeah.. No I don't.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.830
I've been in prison for
a couple of days.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.270
It was a mistake.

50:03.480 --> 50:07.314
I thought someone had assaulted
my daughter.

50:11.080 --> 50:16.029
I should probably tell you
I've spoken with more candidates.

50:17.120 --> 50:20.032
And this is not just my decision.

50:20.280 --> 50:22.157
Listen, this is what you should do.

50:22.360 --> 50:26.672
Call my secretary...
start next month.

50:30.440 --> 50:33.034
Can't you hire me sooner?

50:33.240 --> 50:36.312
If it were only up to me...

50:36.880 --> 50:39.553
...it would've been done already.

50:48.840 --> 50:50.398
Thank you.

50:51.720 --> 50:55.156
Sorry for keeping you from your work.
- No problem.

51:01.240 --> 51:05.153
What? A queer that treats me like this?
I must be dreaming.

51:05.360 --> 51:07.510
Like I didn't know his wife
ran way from him...

51:07.720 --> 51:10.792
...because one of his employees
was fucking him in the ass.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.357
All horse butchers know
that Blanchat loves cocks.

51:15.560 --> 51:18.791
He sure has a good dose of self-esteem
for a damn faggot.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.275
I bet his father was
just like him.

51:21.480 --> 51:26.873
Why are so many rich people gay?
Must be the lack of physical labour.

51:27.360 --> 51:31.319
They're complete slackers.
That messes up their genes.

51:31.520 --> 51:35.559
Yeah that's it.
French and their France Chevaline.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.991
It's an insult to us that this
asshole is a Frenchman.

51:39.200 --> 51:43.512
If we're being controlled by these people
we must be a nation of rich bastards.

51:43.720 --> 51:46.188
The fancier their clothes the worse they are.

51:46.400 --> 51:50.598
Form my ass. I should've slapped
him in the face right away.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.712
I should've kicked in his brains.
Asking about my record.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.957
Does this fuck think I'm
some kind of leper?

51:57.160 --> 52:00.470
He should go to prison and find out
what the real world's made of.

52:00.680 --> 52:04.639
But rich people never go to jail.
Maybe one or two every ten year.

52:04.840 --> 52:09.231
Jail is for the poor.
And laws are for the rich.

52:09.440 --> 52:14.150
The poor can't steal.
Only be stolen from and fucked over.

52:14.360 --> 52:16.635
Not a problem.
And the white collars...

52:16.840 --> 52:20.355
...can take our money, happiness
and dignity from us.

52:20.560 --> 52:23.996
Each day these frauds
and their sons...

52:24.200 --> 52:28.478
...have their hands in your pockets
and your ass.

52:28.720 --> 52:32.554
Yours, your wife's, your kid's.
And they'll make you smile even.

52:32.760 --> 52:35.797
Ok I'll smile.
But after that: revenge.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.956
That's what I enjoy most.

52:38.160 --> 52:41.391
France needs people like
Robespierre.

52:41.600 --> 52:44.831
Not those wimps that
are our government.

52:45.040 --> 52:48.032
It's been like that in the country
for centuries. That or worse.

52:48.240 --> 52:50.959
Everyone's too gay
for revolution.

52:51.160 --> 52:53.674
Now all that's left is revenge.

52:54.080 --> 52:57.311
Yeah, like me. And I'll make it
better for everyone.

52:57.520 --> 53:00.512
If Robespierre was a national hero
so will I...

53:00.720 --> 53:03.757
...on a small scale,
by killing all those pigs...

53:03.960 --> 53:06.349
...that don't want to give me
a job because I was in jail.

53:06.560 --> 53:12.192
Does he want me to become a lowlife
that sucks his dick for a dime?

53:12.400 --> 53:15.119
I'll show him real violence.

53:15.320 --> 53:17.880
The 50 years of humiliation
that I've had...

53:18.080 --> 53:22.437
...he'll get in six minutes.
Six minutes of pure agony.

53:22.640 --> 53:25.359
Unfortunately he won't be
able to learn from the experience.

53:25.560 --> 53:28.870
His family will pay the price.
And his friends.

53:29.080 --> 53:30.911
Rich people always have friends.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.833
I have no friends.
Only my gun.

53:36.280 --> 53:39.352
Look, a bar.
I'll drink to that fucker...

53:39.560 --> 53:42.028
...that doesn't know he just signed
his own death certificate.

53:42.240 --> 53:45.596
Yeah, I've got some money left.
About eleven Francs.

53:46.160 --> 53:48.594
I know what tomorrow will be like.

53:48.800 --> 53:52.236
I'll wait for him tomorrow night,.
at the gate. And follow him.

53:52.440 --> 53:55.398
The moment he sees me he gets scared.

53:55.600 --> 53:58.876
He speeds up his pace when
I get closer.

54:00.400 --> 54:02.834
How are you? Finished your work for today?

54:03.040 --> 54:05.508
It must be exhausting to refuse
giving people a job all day.

54:05.720 --> 54:09.235
Boy you sure know how to humiliate
people form behind your desk.

54:09.440 --> 54:11.431
You do remember me, right?

54:12.360 --> 54:17.195
You have a house, a car, clothes
and your money in the bank.

54:17.400 --> 54:20.915
Of the 35 years I've worked
I have nothing left.

54:21.120 --> 54:24.192
All that's left of my life
isn't what's on your form...

54:24.400 --> 54:27.790
...it's my gun.
Oh, you're not used to guns.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.355
Well, I'm not used to cash.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.835
I would've wanted a normal
life myself.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.235
After 35 years of work and honesty...

54:35.440 --> 54:39.558
...my supplier treats me like
I'm a criminal.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.878
Ok Mr. Boss, I've lost.

54:46.080 --> 54:48.640
I'm a piece of shit.
But I do have a gun.

54:48.840 --> 54:53.595
I'm not afraid.
I have the last word.

54:53.800 --> 54:58.555
I'll put the gun to his neck
and watch his gay face twitch.

54:58.760 --> 55:01.354
Shitting yourself yet?
Why are you such a wimp?

55:01.560 --> 55:04.632
Because I'm jobless?
Or is it my record?

55:05.720 --> 55:07.676
Do you know what the jobless says?

55:07.880 --> 55:10.758
Fuck you.
Of all races in the world...

55:10.960 --> 55:13.076
...one must go.
Can you guess which?

55:13.280 --> 55:15.669
Yours. Assholes and
traitors.

55:15.880 --> 55:19.759
I'll raise my gun and blow his
brains out. Are you listening now?

55:19.960 --> 55:24.511
And I'll shoot again.
I can hear him scream: No! No!

55:24.760 --> 55:26.637
How's that, Mr. Boss?

55:26.840 --> 55:31.789
Life can be violent.
You didn't expect this, did you?

55:33.120 --> 55:36.112
How much do I owe you?
- 12 Francs.

55:55.440 --> 55:57.590
How about 11.20?

56:03.440 --> 56:05.112
What's wrong with you?

56:08.880 --> 56:10.598
Do you want to suck my dick?

56:13.600 --> 56:15.272
Do you want to suck my dick?

56:18.600 --> 56:20.318
Poor sod.

56:27.600 --> 56:29.750
Nigger fag.

56:35.960 --> 56:38.520
I said: nigger fag.

56:39.560 --> 56:42.950
Get the fuck out.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

56:43.160 --> 56:46.118
Did you hear me? Off you go.
- I didn't do anything.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.788
Fuck of.
- I didn't do anything!

56:49.000 --> 56:51.309
Get the fuck out, asshole.
- Don't piss me off.

56:54.840 --> 56:57.434
Do you see this gun?
Leave my son alone.

56:57.640 --> 57:01.679
I won't shoot you in the ass
but in the head, punk.

57:01.920 --> 57:03.239
Piss off.

57:04.160 --> 57:06.628
Piss off or I'll blow your brains out.

57:17.080 --> 57:18.911
It's ok.

57:19.640 --> 57:21.392
It's ok.

57:21.600 --> 57:22.749
Pussy.

57:25.360 --> 57:28.830
You don't understand shit.
Whose bitch are you?

57:29.040 --> 57:31.952
Piss off asshole.
He's crazy.

57:32.200 --> 57:34.794
This fucker thinks he runs the show.

57:36.160 --> 57:39.232
Where did he come from?
- He's drunk.

57:39.440 --> 57:42.432
The barkeeper was nice enough
just to wave his gun around.

57:43.080 --> 57:45.594
I would've pulled the trigger.

57:45.800 --> 57:48.951
You're a tough one.
- An alcoholic.

57:49.160 --> 57:50.957
Another round, barkeep.

57:52.800 --> 57:55.598
Just one?
- Yeah, for me and my mates.

57:55.800 --> 57:59.076
Assholes. I'm going to get my gun.

57:59.280 --> 58:01.794
They don't know me yet.
Don't know who I am.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.549
Don't be afraid of using violence.
It's a man thing.

58:05.760 --> 58:08.433
I have to handle this
nice and quick.

58:08.640 --> 58:13.316
I'll show them my country's justice.
They'll bow to the gun.

58:13.520 --> 58:17.513
No justice without revenge.
I won't bring in the cops.

58:19.240 --> 58:22.949
I must let justice rule.
Death to those punks.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.718
No mercy.

58:24.920 --> 58:27.229
A bullet in their empty heads...

58:27.440 --> 58:30.432
...and that's two less
parasites in the world.

58:32.240 --> 58:35.038
fuck. I need to check the gun.

58:38.600 --> 58:40.113
Three bullets left.

58:40.720 --> 58:43.359
One for the barkeeper. One for his son.

58:43.560 --> 58:47.951
And one more for the asshole that called
me an alcoholic. Respect I'll get.

58:48.160 --> 58:50.071
I must get my aim straight on the
first two shots.

58:50.280 --> 58:54.353
I don't know what sewer they came out of
but they don't look French.

58:54.560 --> 58:58.633
The father wore a crucifix. Maybe he's
Spanish or a Porto farmer.

58:58.840 --> 59:02.071
Some change their name and religion
just to infiltrate France.

59:02.280 --> 59:06.558
But I'm French and I'll teach
them some dignity.

59:15.360 --> 59:17.078
Come outside.

59:17.640 --> 59:20.154
Are you coming outside old faggot?

59:24.040 --> 59:25.758
Are you coming or what?

59:28.840 --> 59:31.229
Hey, are you coming outside, pussy?

59:35.120 --> 59:36.838
I'm talking to you!

59:40.120 --> 59:42.350
You don't have the guts, do you?

59:42.800 --> 59:45.792
Are you coming, pussy?

59:56.480 --> 59:58.436
I'll show you who I am.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.993
Fuck.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.157
cock lover!

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.951
You'd think the world's civilised
but it's a jungle.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.233
And in the jungle you better be
with the strong animals.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.795
Or you're a prey...

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.560
...that has to constantly
run for its life.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.070
It all depends on luck
when you're born.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.558
Or you're born poor and have to
submit to the force of others.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.469
Standing in the queue, being humiliated.
But sometimes you get violent.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.148
Or you're born rich
and you take care of your money.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.511
Pretending to love your wife,
kids and friends...

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.836
...just like they pretend
to love you.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.919
But as soon as your life or your house
burns down...

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.750
...and have nothing left to give,
your so-called friends...

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:33.509
...will all crush you, in silence.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.836
To "help" you.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.474
Which is exactly what they like to do.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.148
The worse your situation is,
asking for help...

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.830
...the better they'll feel.
And crush you.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.878
I don't think I'll ever
get things straight.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.833
My time has come. I've collapsed.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.318
I'm in deep shit,
complete and utter shit.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.718
But I'm not afraid. On the contrary.
I'm not asking anyone for help.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.508
I'll go on right until the end.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.837
I'll dig a tunnel
right though all this crap.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.799
That's my goal. Go on until the end.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.709
My entire life's been
one giant piece of shit...

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.798
...wanted by my mother
who loved to get laid...

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.833
...whose face I've never even seen

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.073
Say that again, fucking ape.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.231
Say that again if you're a man.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.112
I'm going to fucking shoot you.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.799
The blood's gushing out of this.
fucker's head

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.673
He wants to cry for help
but no one's coming.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.348
Only his damn son.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.550
Fucker.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.197
The third bullet is for my friend
at the abattoir.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.279
I'll go into his office
and give him my form.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.879
You went bankrupt.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.994
After I've finished them,
I have to kill myself.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.959
Nice suicide for the butcher.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.280
Because I'll die anyway
I might as well do whatever I want.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.472
No more punishment, no more crime.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.109
Some fun is forbidden...

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:35.518
...just because assholes in a
priest outfit or a tie say so.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.314
But I don't like them.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.273
They've ruined my life.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.268
In the name of moral they've
betrayed me.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.071
So why shouldn't I
kill myself now?

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.033
Three more bullets.
If I keep one for myself...

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:04.915
...I'd still have two
for the others. Yeah.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.236
No one's going to miss me.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.908
They'd probably feel relieved.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.317
Yeah, I could die
and that's it.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.711
The void, like before I was born.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.399
What about Cynthia? Can I
leave her behind just like that?

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.033
Without saying goodbye?

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.915
Would I get her kicked out
to become a bum...

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:47.558
...to be fucked and beaten up by
the rest of the bums in Paris?

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.229
No.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.638
I'm her father.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:56.277
Even if she'd been a mistake,
it's my responsibility.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.954
Ah yeah. That pig from the abattoir.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.428
I'm going to kill him like no man's
ever been killed before.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:01.077
Make him suffer as much as possible.
So I'll enjoy it as much as possible.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.198
He's going to pay for
all that deserve to die...

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.516
...but who I can't kill.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.518
Even if he's not the worst.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.793
If I had to kill an asshole,
he's the biggest prick I know.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.996
And today I'm going to blow his
queer head to pieces.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.478
It's the only way of getting
my dignity back...

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.592
...and my joy in life.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.589
There is no other solution.
It's clear now.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.550
Every man his moral. Every man
his justice.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.311
And mine is on its way.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.554
So you see I came back.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.834
I'm taking her to the Eiffel Tower.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.349
Have a nice day.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.838
Thank you.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:34.114
She sure has changed these
last months. I hardly recognize her.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.278
Maybe in a couple of years she
will look like her mother.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.519
What will I look like in 10 years?
I bet I'll be long dead.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:46.114
It would be nice to know
what the future brings. Who knows?

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.074
If we're lucky we'll have
world war 3.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.670
And all the assholes around me
will be blown to bits.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:58.639
Why France and not the rest?
We're not worse than the Germans.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.597
Well German should be destroyed.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.190
They're all nazis
or sons of nazis.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:09.073
Nazis killed my father.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.750
1988, the year of total destruction
of Germany by the Russians.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:19.795
Give them a warm hand.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.830
Why am I making this all up?

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.674
Tonight I will not longer
be on this planet.

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:29.475
I'm sure.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.910
But she doesn't know.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.631
It's strange.

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:42.673
How quickly a life passes and
all for nothing. Strange.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.711
She's so still,
like she's afraid of something.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.196
I bet she can feel we're not
going to the Eiffel Tower.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.277
I have to comfort her.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.636
We're going on a long journey.
A very long journey.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.678
Just us two.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.751
You like that, don't you?

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.674
Attention. You have 30 seconds to
leave the projection area.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.117
Only after you've lost everything
you will find your way back.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:14.310
Maybe the hunger is clearing
my thoughts.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.953
The less you eat,
the more you see.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:20.470
Back in the camps some people
saw magnetic waves.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.877
It'll all be ok. I hope.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.515
I have nothing to lose.
I feel stronger than ever.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.314
Life is a constant battle.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:34.957
For success; don't hesitate.
That takes a lot of energy.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.799
Danger

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:43.359
Hotel de l'Avenir
March 23 1980 around noon.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.639
She's lucky to have a father.
I never knew mine.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.513
He was killed by the Krauts

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.958
Why has she changed this much?

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.675
May they did some strange things
with her in the home.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.597
No I don't think so.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.880
There's only women there.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.870
My daughter is pretty good looking.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.796
I'm proud of her.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:30.237
She has a lovely body. much
nicer than her mother's.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.950
I should bathe her.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.879
No.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:40.676
There's only a sink. And besides
I might do something stupid.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.952
The gun?

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.752
Yeah.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.837
I shouldn't be afraid.

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:51.397
When I wait too long I
could change my mind.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.077
Let's be clear about this.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.670
The violence I'd have to use
does serve a purpose...

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:02.032
...of getting us out of this
misery pretty easily.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.109
Being dead must be like sleeping.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.675
But better.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.435
What has to be done, has to be done.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.831
There. Did what I had to do.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.197
But it wasn't as beautiful
as I thought it would be.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.358
Now let's make an end to
all this misery.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.232
I have nothing left to lose.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.115
Yeah, that's it.
I'm doing this for me.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.993
It's my duty to protect you from
years of misery yet to come.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.510
Wait for me on the other side.
I'll be there right away.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.831
It won't take long.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.552
There, we're done.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.073
It's over.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.640
I haven't missed, her have I?

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.077
Come on, die.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.113
What's keeping you?

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.750
A knife would've been better.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.871
I've killed pigs.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.231
My priest taught me.
Stick the knife into the main artery.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.238
She's shaking like a pig.
She's in pain. I hate this.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.079
It seemed easer in the abattoir.
Now what?

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.750
Why am I doing this?
She's dying. Against my will.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.952
A higher force's leading me.
She dies where she was made.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:56.073
It was the force, not me.
She's going back...

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.670
...where she came from. That's what I'll
say in court. What court?

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.916
Back to where I started. I'll kill myself.
I'm getting sick.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:06.511
Don't throw up, not now, next to her.
She's in a lot of pain.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.553
This could take too long.
I need to finish her.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.228
No use crying over spilt milk.
If I shoot one more time...

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.910
...I won't have any bullets left for
myself and the abattoir queer.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.749
Life's always heading in one direction
and way too quickly.

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.112
It's good against evil.
I must decide.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:30.672
Piling up mistake upon mistake
until time erases them.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.917
But death is no mistake,
it's the only way out.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.792
My daughter's gone,
now it's my turn.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.912
Blow your fucking brains out.
Show them your brain.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:42.351
Everyone always forgets we're only,
flesh, fat and bones.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.472
I'm a piece of flesh that thinks too much.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.433
They've killed my daughter.
Let the flesh stop.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.916
Butcher, free the steak of itself.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.951
Someone assaulted my child.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.596
I'm going to kill the bastard.
it's my duty.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.439
The labourer...
My father was a communist.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.713
He wanted what was right.
The Krauts killed him.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.718
Because he was a humanist.
Death sentence, no buts.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.674
Fortunately the Americans and
the Russians killed those nazis...

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.872
...and their fucking wives.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.710
But they left the nazi pest
still around in this country.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.229
All those who sympathized
should've been publicly...

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.079
...raped and castrated.
Let them suffer.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.510
The Americans are much
more developed than we are.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.792
It's almost over. I want to see my father's
face. And my mother's...

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.755
She was evil.
Pull the trigger, man.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.713
She was a slut who betrayed
Jews and commies.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.751
Are you chickening out?
Often evil wins.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:44.635
I'll save the last bullet for the director.
Jesus I'm good.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:49.868
They crucified him and fucking priests
have stolen his image.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.277
Everything good is long dead.
To let evil rule everything.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.074
No. You must fight evil.
I'm good...

01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:00.239
...so he has to die, not me.
A father, a daughter, a gun.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.715
The world is evil,
good must triumph.

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.835
There is no room for the pure.
Maybe she's not dead. I'm coming.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.955
God I love you.
You don't die that quickly.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:14.118
Help me escape from this stinking
cheese.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.517
She's only pretending.
Worms all over.

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.553
The cheese is not enough.
They want my flesh.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.797
Worms in priest clothes.
Too good to be true.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.037
They've come in your name,
but they're lying.

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.279
They're nazis.
Why have I mutilated her like this?

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.790
Evil was inside of them.
No one will ever touch her.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.312
Maybe at the morgue they'll stick a
finger up her pussy.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:42.592
I'll save the bullet to
blast open her body.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.918
She's pure. I'm continuing as planned.
She'll wait for me.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:50.112
Cynthia, you are no longer trapped
in your body.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.277
The first murder is the most
important one

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:56.314
Hang on, I'm coming too. Maybe
my damn mother is waiting for me too.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:59.273
It would be great to die together.
With Cynthia's mother.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.040
We're innocent.
Good must rule.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.756
I'm coming, baby.
Count to ten. Ten... Nine...

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.555
I'll bring our past and our love.
From my brain?

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.433
What will they do with my brains
and my dick?

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.790
At the morgue they slice them up
and put them in a jar.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.036
They have done something to this room.

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:21.869
You have to pay, even for the air
or they will gas you to death.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.834
Death has to be good. I don't have
enough bullets for everyone.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:30.272
It's either them or me,
so I'll go.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.630
Cynthia's waiting for me anyway.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:37.311
Yeah, honey, wait. Seven, six...
But we'll be back.

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.196
And I'll be the president.
And rule over France.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.710
And I'll screw them all.
They won't get away.

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:48.195
The red button. And the void.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.996
All they get is pieces of brain.
The time has come.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.912
It's all over.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.875
No it's me.
It's my head.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.951
No I shouldn't do this.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.354
I'm a good person and
it should stay that way.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.075
Strange how I always seem to fail.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.955
My birth, my youth,
love, the shop.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.319
I never should've been born.
Ever.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.478
Never.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:44.433
My entire life is a mistake.
Everything but my daughter is.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.834
I know what will happen.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.355
This is just a deja vu.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.358
I've been here a thousand times.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.313
Everything seems to repeat over and over.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.597
I love you more than anything.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.069
Don't leave me alone.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.588
Moral

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.677
Mankind has a moral.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.714
I don't know how this
day will end.

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.272
But I'm here with you.

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:09.113
And I'm happy.
Happier than I ever was.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.636
The rest is not important.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.356
Maybe it's our last day,
maybe not.

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.791
Maybe I'll never shoot
myself in the head.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.389
Maybe I'll sleep with you...

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.029
...and go to jail tomorrow.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.595
Four months, a year, two years.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.634
Ah, jail wasn't so bad.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.515
And if it is,
I could always hang myself.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:42.079
Even if I go to jail I'll always have
this moment to give me courage.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:47.110
And the satisfaction of having done
what I wanted and not what someone did.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.279
Maybe I can give my life a meaning
after all. Protecting you...

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:55.871
...and making you happier
than anyone else ever did.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:00.596
You're my daughter.
And I'll make you... a woman.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.157
We shall do it.
And be happy.

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.351
It'll be our little secret.

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.871
Whether we do it or not,
humanity won't change.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:18.510
But to you and me it
means a total change.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.235
People think they're free.
But freedom doesn't exist.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:26.519
Just laws that unknown people
made to protect themselves...

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:29.280
...that lock me and my sadness away.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.314
One of those laws says
I can not love you...

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.193
...because you're my daughter.
And why?

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.154
I bet they don't forbid it because
it's a wrong thing to do...

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.794
...but because it's too strong.

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.557
In our case there is no other solution.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.513
I love you.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.515
And nothing else.
