00:14.988 --> 00:16.297
Where you headed, little lady?

00:16.300 --> 00:18.954
Oh, my god. Thank you so much.

00:18.956 --> 00:20.138
You're so sweet.

00:20.140 --> 00:23.082
I had a flat a mile back,
and my legs are killing me.

00:23.084 --> 00:25.258
But anyway, uh, I'm
looking to get to Laredo.

00:25.356 --> 00:26.891
How far are you headed?

00:26.892 --> 00:27.892
Not that far.

00:29.836 --> 00:30.987
Look, um...

00:30.989 --> 00:32.586
I promise...

00:32.588 --> 00:34.283
I'll show you a good time.

00:34.764 --> 00:37.194
Well, all right, get in.

00:44.140 --> 00:45.140
Hey, wait! No!

00:47.660 --> 00:50.154
* He's doin' all right when
his ear is on the ground *

00:50.156 --> 00:52.938
For everyone who beat
the fog in to work today,

00:52.940 --> 00:56.810
a little tidbit from your
resident yogi, Chavez...

00:56.812 --> 00:59.179
basic warrior pose.

00:59.180 --> 01:02.538
Really? Has to have his shirt off?

01:02.540 --> 01:05.226
I wish I didn't like that so much.

01:05.227 --> 01:07.018
How about a tougher pose, there, yogi?

01:07.020 --> 01:08.522
This seems rather easy.

01:08.524 --> 01:10.474
Sure, how about warrior III?

01:10.476 --> 01:14.538
Bend at the hips, making
your back flat as a table.

01:16.140 --> 01:19.690
Let's see how long you
can hold that one, Mr. MMA.

01:19.692 --> 01:21.162
Let's see how long you can hold these.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.762
Oh, I walked right into this one, didn't I?

01:22.764 --> 01:24.874
Namaste.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.570
Welcome to the night shift, Downward Doc.

01:26.572 --> 01:28.458
Incoming!

01:30.892 --> 01:32.778
12-year-old female caught in a flash flood.

01:32.780 --> 01:33.770
Slammed into a rock.

01:33.772 --> 01:35.370
Neck laceration, abdominal contusions.

01:35.372 --> 01:36.362
B.P. 90/60.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.738
Her name is Abby.

01:37.740 --> 01:38.698
Abby, sweetie?

01:38.700 --> 01:40.170
Sweetie, can you hear me?

01:40.172 --> 01:42.826
Her GCS is 4-4-2. You're
not gonna get much.

01:42.828 --> 01:44.682
Okay, get ready to transfer.

01:44.684 --> 01:47.466
Okay. Buckles off. Get rid of this blanket.

01:47.468 --> 01:50.250
On my count. 1, 2, 3.

01:50.252 --> 01:52.042
All right.

01:52.044 --> 01:53.738
All right.

01:53.740 --> 01:56.874
Guarding. Pelvis is unstable.

01:56.876 --> 01:58.666
Surgical belly on exam.

01:58.668 --> 01:59.882
Checking for cervical vertebrae.

01:59.884 --> 02:01.258
Call X-ray. We need a lateral c-spine.

02:01.260 --> 02:02.954
We have to make sure that
her neck's not broken.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.234
What else we got, Gwen?

02:04.236 --> 02:05.706
The only other incoming we have is

02:05.708 --> 02:06.986
her older brother Blake, 17.

02:06.988 --> 02:08.394
He dove into the water after her.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.418
He's hypothermic.

02:09.419 --> 02:10.858
Yeah, saw the blue lips. He needs oxygen.

02:10.860 --> 02:13.226
80 tympanic. Pop around. Here we go.

02:13.228 --> 02:14.538
Hey. Wow.

02:14.540 --> 02:16.746
His organs are gonna shut down
if we don't warm him up soon.

02:16.748 --> 02:18.122
Kenny, we'll need the bair hugger.

02:18.124 --> 02:19.978
All right, on my count. 1, 2, and 3.

02:21.964 --> 02:23.023
- You got this covered?
- Got it.

02:23.047 --> 02:25.168
Good. Brave kid.

02:25.178 --> 02:25.983
Reckless kid.

02:26.027 --> 02:28.107
Apparently went dirt-biking
right when the flood hit.

02:28.709 --> 02:31.348
Ragosa, we got two minors, both critical.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.569
We need to track down their parents,

02:32.575 --> 02:33.405
and we're getting slammed.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.369
Where's T.C. and Jordan?

02:34.383 --> 02:35.882
Uh, they're still at the
search-and-rescue lecture

02:35.901 --> 02:38.072
with Paul. Okay? They'll be back soon.

02:40.650 --> 02:41.854
Son of a bitch.

02:42.021 --> 02:44.029
Tire's shredded, steering is broken.

02:44.073 --> 02:45.173
We're not going anywhere.

02:45.288 --> 02:46.707
You were driving too fast.

02:46.727 --> 02:47.847
I knew I should have driven.

02:47.874 --> 02:49.270
I wasn't driving too fast.

02:49.286 --> 02:50.152
There's rocks in the road.

02:50.180 --> 02:52.220
- I didn't put the rocks in the road.
- Hey, guys, guys.

02:52.226 --> 02:54.155
We weren't the first to hit them.

02:57.085 --> 02:58.948
Those look like fresh tire tracks.

03:07.982 --> 03:09.039
God.

03:10.645 --> 03:12.672
Paul, you, uh, grab Jordan's med kit.

03:12.787 --> 03:14.878
Yeah.

03:19.664 --> 03:20.927
That was fast.

03:21.299 --> 03:22.682
"Be quick, don't hurry."

03:22.701 --> 03:24.701
John Wooden. Google him.

03:24.964 --> 03:26.452
It's coming from Abby.

03:29.629 --> 03:31.483
God, it... it's her mom from work.

03:31.693 --> 03:34.322
Talk to her. Tell her we
need consent for surgery now.

03:34.365 --> 03:36.713
How do I tell her? I... I
don't even know what to say.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.043
Just break it gently.

03:38.045 --> 03:40.330
No parent wants to hear
their kid's in the E.R.

03:41.453 --> 03:43.058
It looks like they came off the turn

03:43.071 --> 03:45.054
- and came over the embankment.
- Mm-hmm.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.513
And the driver?

03:46.556 --> 03:47.705
Decapitated.

03:47.890 --> 03:48.916
Not pretty.

03:49.031 --> 03:51.746
Not gonna look. Not gonna look.

03:51.861 --> 03:53.297
Well, I guess we should call it in, huh?

03:53.321 --> 03:54.649
Yeah. Yeah.

03:54.764 --> 03:57.317
Hey, you hear that?

03:57.500 --> 03:58.500
Yeah.

04:01.981 --> 04:03.255
- Tee, be careful.
- Uh-huh.

04:12.633 --> 04:14.195
It's okay. We're doctors.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.296
<i>Médicos?</i>

04:18.553 --> 04:20.546
No, no, no, no, no! Wait, wait! No!

04:20.576 --> 04:22.222
No! No, wait! Whoa, whoa! Hey, no!

04:23.835 --> 04:25.128
We can help you. We can help!

04:26.444 --> 04:27.609
All right.

04:28.465 --> 04:29.869
T.C., look.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.435
Carla!

04:33.550 --> 04:34.926
<i>- ¿Hermana?
- Por favor!</i>

04:34.940 --> 04:35.940
It's okay.

04:38.465 --> 04:40.025
Four victims. Two of them are critical.

04:40.140 --> 04:43.750
Okay, no ambulance and no
chance of an airlift in this fog.

04:45.411 --> 04:46.878
Okay, it would be probably
best not to stay here.

04:46.902 --> 04:47.846
All right, it's freezing cold.

04:47.874 --> 04:48.779
- Aah.
- We're on unstable ground.

04:48.792 --> 04:50.152
- Lo siento.
- We need shelter now.

04:50.176 --> 04:52.302
I think there was a store
about a quarter mile back,

04:52.326 --> 04:54.277
- just around the curve.
- Okay, let's go there. All right,

04:54.301 --> 04:55.336
let's do it.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.762
My sister... is she okay?

04:58.048 --> 05:00.650
We don't know yet.
She has been badly injured.

05:00.706 --> 05:01.556
Breathe in for me.

05:01.576 --> 05:02.770
I was supposed to watch her.

05:02.971 --> 05:04.430
God, you can't let anything happen to her.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.810
Listen, we are doing the
very best that we can.

05:06.823 --> 05:08.779
But we got to take care of you, too, okay?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.833
Is this Abby's brother?

05:11.995 --> 05:14.023
- How's he doing?
- Hypothermia, but

05:14.043 --> 05:14.886
he's warming up.

05:14.922 --> 05:16.618
Yeah, his core temp is about 97.

05:16.895 --> 05:17.942
He's looking good.

05:21.417 --> 05:22.417
What's going on?

05:24.742 --> 05:26.616
This kid is drowning. Intubate!

05:26.731 --> 05:28.722
Wait a minute, sats are fine.

05:28.764 --> 05:30.216
Drew! Right now!

05:30.235 --> 05:33.033
Let's go! We don't have
much time. Just do it!

05:35.001 --> 05:36.647
Cricoid pressure.

05:37.123 --> 05:38.514
Pulse ox is down to 87.

05:38.562 --> 05:39.978
Let's go. Get it in.

05:40.093 --> 05:42.053
His cords are slammed
shut. I can't pass the tube.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.133
Toph, he's choking to death.

06:01.726 --> 06:02.763
Okay, sats down to 70.

06:02.791 --> 06:04.626
Airway still closed. What is that?

06:04.665 --> 06:07.360
Laryngeal nerve block. It'll
paralyze the vocal cords.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.747
Hopefully, we can open them up.

06:09.771 --> 06:11.081
What happened to him?

06:11.196 --> 06:12.618
It's called dry drowning.

06:12.913 --> 06:15.185
His vocal cords are seizing
up from being underwater.

06:15.186 --> 06:16.808
Okay, let's go! Intubate.

06:17.841 --> 06:20.105
Come on, Blake. Hang on for your sister.

06:21.855 --> 06:24.456
- Paul, what have we got in the kit?
- Uh, not much.

06:26.912 --> 06:29.072
She's having trouble breathing.

06:29.210 --> 06:31.045
Get me a bait hook, size 5.

06:31.094 --> 06:33.057
Yeah, uh, what's it for?

06:33.100 --> 06:34.530
A little front-line medicine.

06:34.604 --> 06:36.185
Her tongue is blocking her airway,

06:36.245 --> 06:37.808
so we're gonna put the hook
through her tongue and lip.

06:37.832 --> 06:40.368
This should hold the tongue in
place to keep her airway clear.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.984
She may go into shock when
you put the hook through.

06:43.042 --> 06:45.331
Never been in a situation like
this, I mean, not even close.

06:45.355 --> 06:46.952
Have the Ambu bag ready.

06:47.067 --> 06:49.424
No anesthetic. <i>Lo siento.</i>

06:59.591 --> 07:01.327
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey.

07:01.362 --> 07:03.724
- Hey, after the shift, I thought maybe we'd, uh...
- Oh, just n... not here,

07:03.738 --> 07:05.003
okay? I... I got to get Joey.

07:05.026 --> 07:06.344
Blake's sister is getting
prepped for surgery.

07:06.368 --> 07:07.134
Oh, yeah.

07:07.164 --> 07:08.979
Well, how do you like
working with Downward Doc?

07:09.003 --> 07:10.446
I mean, he's actually really humble.

07:10.561 --> 07:12.431
Last night, he spent two hours
stitching kids up in the E.R.

07:12.448 --> 07:13.387
Just because you guys got slammed.

07:13.412 --> 07:14.971
Wait a minute. Us guys?

07:15.627 --> 07:17.253
Anyway, I... I got to run.

07:17.283 --> 07:18.965
Just... just let me know
when the mom gets here, okay?

07:18.989 --> 07:19.989
Yeah.

07:22.818 --> 07:23.818
Joey?

07:25.861 --> 07:27.513
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.

07:27.628 --> 07:29.183
Well, no worries.

07:29.299 --> 07:30.805
What did the C.T. show?

07:30.815 --> 07:32.841
A grade 2 pelvic fracture, I think.

07:32.956 --> 07:34.270
Take a look for yourself.

07:36.267 --> 07:37.888
Oh, no.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.302
No, that's a grade 3.

07:39.337 --> 07:41.230
Look, pelvis is broken from both sides.

07:41.285 --> 07:42.595
That's nasty stuff.

07:42.710 --> 07:43.710
How is she doing?

07:43.802 --> 07:45.664
Just not well. Losing blood.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.359
Just... Her blood pressure's...

07:48.409 --> 07:49.655
Keep talking.

07:49.819 --> 07:51.514
Barely holding a 90 systolic.

07:51.682 --> 07:52.914
And I, uh,

07:53.249 --> 07:54.559
I think she has a ruptured bladder.

07:54.583 --> 07:57.109
Okay, I need you to meet
me in pre-op in 10 minutes.

07:57.949 --> 07:59.130
All right?

07:59.170 --> 08:00.434
- Okay.
- Krista,

08:00.955 --> 08:02.624
you seem nervous.

08:03.752 --> 08:04.617
A little.

08:04.662 --> 08:06.852
I just... I just remember when I was 12

08:06.877 --> 08:08.078
and sneaking out with my older brother.

08:08.102 --> 08:09.234
This just isn't fair.

08:09.284 --> 08:11.710
You need to put that out of your mind.

08:12.482 --> 08:13.159
Okay?

08:13.244 --> 08:15.938
This little girl's life
depends on us being focused...

08:16.146 --> 08:17.751
In the present.

08:18.375 --> 08:19.375
Yeah.

08:19.483 --> 08:21.173
Now, let me see your game face.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.693
Come on, you have a game face, right?

08:27.586 --> 08:30.295
- Okay, we'll... we'll work on the game face.
- Okay.

08:30.333 --> 08:32.797
<i>Dr. Clegg, 9732.</i>

08:32.912 --> 08:34.746
<i>Dr. Clegg, 9732.</i>

08:34.861 --> 08:36.792
Boy is stable for now.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.880
These two are pretty close.

08:39.313 --> 08:40.789
Krista talked to the mother.

08:40.905 --> 08:42.804
She's trying to get
here as fast as she can.

08:42.828 --> 08:44.294
Aw, good luck in this fog.

08:44.409 --> 08:46.169
Oh, and, uh, we're gonna
get slammed tonight.

08:46.194 --> 08:48.451
Paul just called. He, T.C.,
and Jordan are out stranded

08:48.479 --> 08:50.069
- with four crash victims...
- Oh, man.

08:50.121 --> 08:52.058
Which means you are
now my new scut puppy.

08:52.173 --> 08:53.173
Meaning?

08:53.671 --> 08:56.190
Meaning, you do whatever I say.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.591
All right? You're in the trenches now, boy.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.865
All right, now,
lots of patients tonight.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.151
Now, greet them, write
down their pain level

09:03.182 --> 09:05.269
- on a scale from 1 to 10, find...
- Kenny.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.088
I pretty much ran the E.R.

09:07.290 --> 09:08.932
I think I can handle this.

09:09.822 --> 09:10.822
Okay.

09:11.148 --> 09:12.541
There's your first customer.

09:16.363 --> 09:17.474
Good evening, sir.

09:17.589 --> 09:18.549
My name is Michael.

09:18.573 --> 09:20.493
On a scale from 1 to 10, can you...

09:20.695 --> 09:21.695
Oh.

09:22.508 --> 09:24.031
Nice to meet you.

09:24.062 --> 09:26.540
Yeah, well, you definitely handled that.

09:32.327 --> 09:34.443
<i>Hola. Me llamo Jordan.</i>

09:34.498 --> 09:36.796
- Ana.
- Ana.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.704
Breath sounds
aren't good. Keep bagging.

09:38.722 --> 09:39.930
<i>¿Y Carla, mi hermana?</i>

09:39.960 --> 09:40.960
How is she?

09:41.073 --> 09:43.663
She's unconscious from shock,
and we're helping her breathe.

09:44.321 --> 09:46.269
Uh,<i> ella no puede respirar.</i>

09:46.477 --> 09:48.321
But we're going to do
everything that we can.

09:48.592 --> 09:50.842
<i>Vamos hacer todo que podamos.</i>

09:54.795 --> 09:56.003
<i>¿Qué pasa?</i>

09:58.401 --> 10:00.081
Ana, you need to trust me.

10:00.145 --> 10:01.875
<i>Soy tu doctora.</i>

10:02.074 --> 10:03.951
What are you afraid of?

10:04.470 --> 10:06.012
<i>¿De quién tienes miedo?</i>

10:07.060 --> 10:08.800
His name is Hector.

10:09.185 --> 10:10.965
<i>Él es un coyote.</i>

10:11.080 --> 10:13.503
He took us... <i>de nuestra
familia en El Salvador.</i>

10:14.443 --> 10:16.180
He is an evil man.

10:18.109 --> 10:21.918
If Hector lives, he kill us all.

10:24.780 --> 10:27.398
Going to perform an exploratory laparotomy

10:27.399 --> 10:30.771
on Abby Maynor, age 12, to
repair a ruptured bladder.

10:30.820 --> 10:32.256
15 blade, please.

10:32.818 --> 10:34.963
Not to me. Uh, to her.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.210
Y... you want me to open?

10:38.530 --> 10:39.806
You're here to learn.

10:41.122 --> 10:43.331
Pfannenstiel incision, horizontal,

10:43.371 --> 10:44.527
across the pelvis.

10:52.245 --> 10:53.756
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.143
Because you're thinking about the girl,

10:56.425 --> 10:57.582
not the cut.

10:59.204 --> 11:00.791
Breathe, Krista.

11:02.609 --> 11:04.608
Now do what you're trained to do.

11:10.227 --> 11:12.841
Nice and easy.

11:17.181 --> 11:18.229
Good.

11:19.272 --> 11:20.835
Hey, Tee.

11:21.945 --> 11:23.841
What's up? You look
like you've seen a ghost.

11:23.888 --> 11:25.980
- What's wrong?
- These people aren't immigrants.

11:26.095 --> 11:28.634
They're victims of human trafficking...

11:29.025 --> 11:30.881
Except this man.

11:31.265 --> 11:33.482
According to Ana, he's the coyote,

11:33.597 --> 11:36.574
and he was gonna sell
these people for sex, work.

11:36.689 --> 11:39.609
- I think he might be dangerous.
- T.C., it's getting harder to bag.

11:40.698 --> 11:41.810
I don't know what happened.

11:41.848 --> 11:43.801
- She was breathing normally a second ago.
- Carla,

11:43.825 --> 11:44.675
<i>¿qué pasa?</i>

11:44.714 --> 11:46.586
Okay, she has a tension pneumothorax.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.480
We have to relieve the
pressure now, or she will die.

11:48.482 --> 11:49.568
I'll check for a needle.

11:49.714 --> 11:50.976
Don't bother, Paul.

11:51.000 --> 11:51.814
Why?

11:51.882 --> 11:53.362
- What are you doing?
- Shopping.

11:53.751 --> 11:54.765
We need a bigger needle.

11:54.829 --> 11:57.034
A fishing rod?

11:57.071 --> 11:59.391
- What are you doing?
- Paul, get back, shut up, and learn.

12:04.642 --> 12:05.713
Paul, bag her.

12:05.747 --> 12:06.747
All right.

12:09.363 --> 12:11.069
Core temp?

12:11.141 --> 12:13.361
92. He's warming up. Looking good.

12:13.869 --> 12:15.586
So, Krista got ahold of their mom.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.511
She was, uh, she was pretty upset.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.884
- Any word on the sister?
- Not yet.

12:20.535 --> 12:21.310
I gotcha.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.511
I took my little sister
out skateboarding one time.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.493
She fell, cracked three teeth.

12:25.516 --> 12:27.383
Felt like the worst
brother in the entire world.

12:27.407 --> 12:29.942
I could only imagine the
guilt this poor kid's feeling

12:31.244 --> 12:32.053
What's wrong with him?

12:32.080 --> 12:33.600
It's called dry drowning.

12:33.850 --> 12:35.658
Could you let me work?

12:39.313 --> 12:40.699
Okay, he's still not out of the woods.

12:40.723 --> 12:43.038
Let's focus on this, shall we?

12:43.039 --> 12:44.684
And how you missed this, Drew?

12:44.799 --> 12:47.330
This can't happen again!
You need to know the signs!

12:49.944 --> 12:52.037
I was gonna ask you about
it when we were done.

12:52.187 --> 12:54.528
I looked it up. It's
only 2% of all drownings.

12:55.138 --> 12:56.138
I mean, how did you know?

12:56.643 --> 12:57.559
What was your first case like?

12:57.619 --> 12:59.438
Nothing to write home about.

12:59.522 --> 13:01.545
Wasn't much different
from this, unfortunately.

13:03.673 --> 13:04.656
You okay, Topher?

13:04.679 --> 13:05.920
Yeah, I... I'm fine.

13:05.945 --> 13:08.468
I got my two top attendings
stranded in the fog.

13:08.492 --> 13:09.492
My pager's buzzing.

13:09.535 --> 13:11.260
Can someone please see what they want?!

13:14.019 --> 13:16.045
This kid is still not
getting enough oxygen!

13:16.768 --> 13:17.820
What are you doing?

13:19.061 --> 13:21.036
The B.P. is spiking... 190/120.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.174
Damn it. We're too late.

13:22.205 --> 13:24.041
Fluid's in his lungs. He's suffocating.

13:29.444 --> 13:30.844
More suction, more suction.

13:30.889 --> 13:32.039
Okay, nitropaste.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.771
Systolic at 180. He's coming down.

13:33.783 --> 13:34.967
Okay, still not good.

13:34.997 --> 13:36.547
Why don't you guys go
find out what's going on

13:36.555 --> 13:38.343
- with T.C., Jordan, and Paul?
- I'll check again.

13:38.367 --> 13:39.302
Thanks, Kenny.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.340
You bet.

13:44.005 --> 13:46.725
Pupils equal and reactive.
No focal deficits.

13:46.975 --> 13:47.975
Neuro looks okay.

13:48.450 --> 13:49.777
<i>Tenemos que hacer algo.</i>

13:50.961 --> 13:52.043
We are...

13:53.904 --> 13:55.047
<i>Inocentes.</i>

13:55.660 --> 13:57.623
Shh. Shh-shh.

13:58.418 --> 13:59.494
He is afraid.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.589
<i>No cometas ninguna imprudencia.</i>

14:02.560 --> 14:03.953
<i>O el coyote nos matará.</i>

14:04.013 --> 14:06.397
Um, <i>no... no hablo mucho.</i>

14:07.093 --> 14:08.093
- G... guys?
- Paul,

14:08.636 --> 14:09.636
come here.

14:10.005 --> 14:11.005
Take over bagging.

14:12.684 --> 14:14.598
Poor kid is scared out of his mind.

14:16.233 --> 14:17.233
So,

14:17.363 --> 14:18.200
what are you making?

14:18.241 --> 14:19.270
A peritoneal tap.

14:19.977 --> 14:20.934
Hector's losing blood internally,

14:20.945 --> 14:22.690
so I figured if we found the blood...

14:22.723 --> 14:24.004
We can recycle it back into him.

14:24.309 --> 14:24.941
Yeah.

14:24.963 --> 14:26.476
Look at you.

14:27.906 --> 14:29.699
Wow. Stabbed, shot.

14:29.880 --> 14:30.880
Great guy.

14:40.404 --> 14:41.475
No blood.

14:42.099 --> 14:43.336
"A" for effort.

14:44.762 --> 14:46.200
Conjunctiva are pale.

14:46.381 --> 14:47.594
If we don't get his blood volume up,

14:47.618 --> 14:49.034
he's got about 30 minutes to live.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.083
Okay.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.743
H... hey, s... should we be worried?

15:05.762 --> 15:07.042
- Because...
- Everything's fine.

15:07.132 --> 15:08.218
Look, I need you to go to my car.

15:08.242 --> 15:10.823
In the glove box, there's a
bottle of contact-lens solution.

15:10.938 --> 15:12.309
I... I'll explain later.

15:12.590 --> 15:13.590
Go.

15:13.708 --> 15:14.708
Okay.

15:17.241 --> 15:18.481
Excuse me.

15:18.795 --> 15:20.361
Sir!

15:20.363 --> 15:22.471
Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Excuse me.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.394
What are you doing up there?

15:23.509 --> 15:25.077
Can't do that. You can't be up there.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.188
I'm sorry. Can I do this?

15:27.243 --> 15:28.511
- Oh!
- God.

15:29.025 --> 15:30.572
Come on, sir, I need you to get down.

15:30.603 --> 15:31.644
Wow. I can't un-see that.

15:32.506 --> 15:33.963
Uh

15:34.078 --> 15:35.516
Any more word on T.C. and the, uh...

15:35.540 --> 15:37.167
Uh, still stranded, man.

15:37.340 --> 15:39.580
Topher knows, and he ain't happy about it.

15:39.656 --> 15:41.055
They're trying to get state rescue

15:41.138 --> 15:43.283
and police out there, but
the fog is making it slow.

15:43.290 --> 15:46.468
Michael Ragosa? Is there
a Michael Ragosa here?

15:46.510 --> 15:47.704
Uh, yes, yes, that's me.

15:47.819 --> 15:49.026
I'll be right there.

15:49.059 --> 15:50.870
- That's the kids' mother. I better go.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:50.894 --> 15:51.939
You must be Mrs. Maynor.

15:51.947 --> 15:54.455
Yes, I'm... I... I tried to
get here as fast as I could,

15:54.470 --> 15:55.657
but traffic was backed up.

15:55.695 --> 15:56.952
- You want to see your kids.
- Yes.

15:56.959 --> 15:58.208
Believe me, I completely understand.

15:58.220 --> 15:59.483
I'm a father myself.

15:59.903 --> 16:02.547
Blake is with Dr. Zia in Trauma 1.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.954
- Can I see him?
- It's better for Blake

16:03.971 --> 16:05.395
if you just let the doctors work on him.

16:05.419 --> 16:07.151
I did speak to Dr. Chavez,

16:07.266 --> 16:08.546
and you can see Abby in the O.R.

16:08.569 --> 16:09.833
- The O.R.?!
- Yes.

16:09.856 --> 16:11.519
Believe me, she's in good hands. All right?

16:11.543 --> 16:12.623
Follow me.

16:18.725 --> 16:20.892
Gwen, where are we on the
chopper to T.C. and Jordan?

16:20.915 --> 16:22.152
I've been trying every channel,

16:22.176 --> 16:24.366
- starting with the state police.
- Why the police?

16:24.612 --> 16:26.882
Paul said they're out there
with a coyote and his victims.

16:26.893 --> 16:27.893
Sounded really scared.

16:27.998 --> 16:29.624
Yeah, well, it sounds pretty scary.

16:29.647 --> 16:31.278
Worst part is, nothing's
flying right now...

16:31.297 --> 16:32.810
not until conditions improve.

16:33.241 --> 16:34.867
Well, with T.C.'s military experience,

16:34.887 --> 16:35.887
he's the perfect guy.

16:40.763 --> 16:43.055
Dr. Chavez, this is Abby's mother.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.687
Ah. Glad to help ease your mind.

16:45.802 --> 16:46.803
Well, how is she?

16:46.841 --> 16:48.082
Please, just tell me the truth.

16:48.123 --> 16:49.331
She's doing great.

16:49.547 --> 16:50.966
Look, this is Abby right here.

16:51.374 --> 16:52.449
Do you see her?

16:52.498 --> 16:53.530
Oh, my god!

16:53.645 --> 16:55.672
She's peaceful, sedated.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.003
My Abby?

16:57.457 --> 16:58.457
Oh.

16:59.359 --> 17:00.699
I could let you go in

17:00.715 --> 17:03.067
and hold her hand for a moment...

17:04.020 --> 17:06.358
but I don't think you want
to see her get operated on.

17:07.872 --> 17:09.267
No, it's... it's too hard.

17:09.382 --> 17:11.391
Look, why don't you go downstairs,

17:11.659 --> 17:13.675
have a cup of coffee, and try to relax?

17:13.868 --> 17:15.710
In about 45 minutes to an hour,

17:15.723 --> 17:17.515
you'll be sitting in recovery with Abby.

17:17.666 --> 17:18.464
I will?

17:18.579 --> 17:19.579
I'm positive.

17:19.628 --> 17:21.755
I've repaired hundreds of bladders,

17:22.205 --> 17:23.748
and all without a hitch.

17:24.501 --> 17:25.707
We promise,

17:25.987 --> 17:27.664
Abby's gonna come out just fine.

17:28.521 --> 17:29.804
Mrs. Maynor?

17:38.667 --> 17:41.140
You do not act like most surgeons.

17:41.255 --> 17:42.703
What, most surgeons are dicks?

17:44.249 --> 17:45.802
Yeah.

17:45.983 --> 17:48.908
I just think most surgeons
forget what parents go through.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.362
Tee, I don't
think he's gonna make it

17:51.386 --> 17:53.119
- much longer.
- I know. No blood.

17:53.191 --> 17:55.699
We have nothing we can
recycle into Hector's body.

17:56.751 --> 17:57.751
It's a shame.

17:58.477 --> 17:59.477
Hey.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.008
We don't get to pick our patients.

18:01.764 --> 18:02.764
I know.

18:03.569 --> 18:05.393
I know. You're right. I'm sorry.

18:06.187 --> 18:07.512
- But he's a scumbag.
- Okay.

18:07.527 --> 18:09.035
- I...
- No one's out on the road.

18:09.078 --> 18:10.984
Fog's still bad, but I got
the contact-lens solution.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.312
Great, great. That's our saline.

18:12.329 --> 18:13.574
It's not much, but it's all we've got

18:13.589 --> 18:14.789
to help Hector's blood volume.

18:14.822 --> 18:16.180
Gonna mainline it.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.400
Oscar?

18:17.728 --> 18:18.780
Oscar!

18:19.057 --> 18:20.600
<i>¡No está respirando!</i>

18:20.895 --> 18:22.575
He's not breathing.

18:22.734 --> 18:23.720
No pulse.

18:23.722 --> 18:25.021
I... I don't get it. He
was stable when I left.

18:25.045 --> 18:26.205
Okay, Paul, move. I got this.

18:26.245 --> 18:27.371
Paul, Paul, call Kenny back.

18:27.391 --> 18:28.786
Tell him we need that airlift now.

18:28.787 --> 18:30.523
And Ambu bag Carla, okay? Go.

18:30.916 --> 18:32.433
He's not moving air.

18:32.615 --> 18:33.973
Pupils are dilated.

18:37.204 --> 18:39.136
Go ahead, snip.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.160
Good work.

18:40.194 --> 18:41.218
Steady hands.

18:41.297 --> 18:42.841
All right, I'm going to pull the stent.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.044
You start pulling the laps.

18:46.380 --> 18:48.209
I need four units A-negative now.

18:48.247 --> 18:50.369
- Okay.
- Clamps and suction.

18:51.041 --> 18:52.121
I don't understand.

18:52.156 --> 18:54.113
- What's going on?
- She's bleeding out.

18:54.228 --> 18:55.542
God, it must be a burst artery.

18:55.573 --> 18:56.776
It's filling up so fast.

18:56.891 --> 18:58.519
B.P. is down to 80 systolic.

18:58.543 --> 18:59.875
Just get that A-negative, stat.

19:00.049 --> 19:02.542
Suction. Okay, it's definitely an artery.

19:02.763 --> 19:03.713
Yeah, but which one?

19:03.723 --> 19:05.163
I don't know, but we better find it.

19:05.195 --> 19:06.674
We don't have much time.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.583
Ok, pupilas are fixed and dilated.

19:13.606 --> 19:16.045
It's been over 20 minutes.
Jordan, I'm calling it.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.653
Okay? I'm sorry.

19:17.812 --> 19:19.480
Nothing we could have done.

19:19.595 --> 19:21.233
Oscar!

19:21.551 --> 19:22.902
Oscar!

19:25.467 --> 19:26.474
No.

19:27.510 --> 19:28.510
Ana,<i> lo siento.</i>

19:28.535 --> 19:29.889
- No.
- <i>Lo siento.</i>

19:29.894 --> 19:30.894
No.

19:32.312 --> 19:34.672
Come on. Let's mainline
the contact-lens solution.

19:34.843 --> 19:36.102
We need to raise his blood volume.

19:36.126 --> 19:37.126
Did I do something wrong?

19:37.162 --> 19:38.573
Did I miss something on the neuro?

19:38.612 --> 19:39.980
Probably a brain bleed.

19:40.015 --> 19:42.841
Even with surgery, he
wouldn't have made it.

19:43.109 --> 19:43.976
T.C., look.

19:44.047 --> 19:45.281
No capillary refill.

19:45.547 --> 19:47.177
Class 4 shock.

19:47.222 --> 19:49.738
Pushing saline now.

19:51.513 --> 19:52.523
H... how can I help?

19:53.158 --> 19:54.017
We got this, Paul.

19:54.029 --> 19:56.338
Okay, I'm gonna get an
E.T.A. on the chopper.

19:59.849 --> 20:02.066
This isn't good.
There's just too much blood.

20:02.119 --> 20:03.545
This angio was inconclusive.

20:03.584 --> 20:04.688
Now, focus, Krista.

20:04.747 --> 20:05.588
No mistakes.

20:05.615 --> 20:08.112
All I can think about is that
poor mom losing her little girl.

20:08.169 --> 20:10.552
In any other room in the
world, that's called compassion.

20:10.575 --> 20:11.605
Not in the O.R.

20:11.619 --> 20:13.912
It's just bad juju, and it's distracting.

20:13.924 --> 20:14.924
Suction.

20:16.637 --> 20:18.307
There it is. There's our bleeder.

20:18.312 --> 20:18.970
The artery.

20:18.986 --> 20:19.860
- You see it?
- Yeah.

20:19.916 --> 20:21.649
Okay, that's the corona mortis,

20:21.660 --> 20:23.027
or the crown of death.

20:23.208 --> 20:25.531
It's an artery only 15% of patients have.

20:25.611 --> 20:27.473
It must have been severed
by the broken pelvis.

20:27.829 --> 20:29.024
Should have known.

20:29.175 --> 20:30.185
Clamp.

20:30.239 --> 20:32.361
B.P. down to 70/35.

20:32.476 --> 20:34.563
Okay, let's just hope
we can save her in time.

20:34.586 --> 20:35.736
Come on, Abby.

20:41.582 --> 20:42.705
Okay.

20:43.065 --> 20:46.027
Here's the deal. Chopper's not
coming for another 20 minutes,

20:46.110 --> 20:47.105
maybe longer.

20:47.116 --> 20:49.141
All right, well, Hector needs blood.

20:49.194 --> 20:50.712
It has to come from one of us.

20:51.224 --> 20:54.228
A little battlefield medicine
called the white-tile test.

20:54.246 --> 20:56.157
It came in handy in Kandahar once.

20:56.221 --> 20:57.437
Putting a drop of our blood

20:57.452 --> 20:59.453
on top of one of these
four drops of Hector's blood

20:59.477 --> 21:01.594
and find out if any of us are a match.

21:03.604 --> 21:04.754
You help him?

21:04.942 --> 21:06.329
<i>No sabe lo que es capaz de hacer.</i>

21:06.389 --> 21:08.247
<i>Es un demonio. Nunca.</i>

21:08.266 --> 21:09.568
- All right.
- <i>Nunca.</i>

21:09.628 --> 21:11.251
I'm gonna take that as a "no."

21:13.433 --> 21:15.379
We're not really gonna do this?

21:15.480 --> 21:17.006
Do you see any other way to save him?

21:18.415 --> 21:20.000
I want to be the match.

21:20.057 --> 21:22.512
I want to do at least
one thing right today.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.295
I'm not sure this <i> is</i>
the right thing, Paul.

21:25.359 --> 21:26.359
What do you mean?

21:27.966 --> 21:29.296
T.C., wh... what does she mean?

21:29.355 --> 21:32.295
Anyway, Paul, let me tell
you about my first ride-along.

21:32.689 --> 21:34.834
The call was this raging, five-alarm fire.

21:34.872 --> 21:36.401
I'm thinking, "oh my god."

21:36.416 --> 21:39.223
I'm supposed to be a new
intern on a freakin' ride-along,

21:39.242 --> 21:40.100
and then, all of a sudden,

21:40.104 --> 21:42.386
they tell me that I'm the
senior medical officer on scene.

21:43.062 --> 21:43.634
So...

21:43.660 --> 21:45.636
So, he breaks the glass and he walks in.

21:46.816 --> 21:48.275
T.C. doesn't always think ahead.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.225
Sorry, who... who is telling this story?

21:50.281 --> 21:53.649
He actually walked right into a fire.

21:54.902 --> 21:56.960
I mean, really, Paul, how stupid is that?

21:58.576 --> 22:00.117
It sounds like T.C. to me.

22:00.523 --> 22:02.628
Uh, I... I mean, not...
not the stupid part.

22:02.642 --> 22:04.512
- I... I meant the...
- Time is up on the test.

22:11.331 --> 22:12.332
Well?

22:12.389 --> 22:13.681
Would you look at that?

22:14.302 --> 22:16.228
Looks like mine is the only one still wet.

22:16.534 --> 22:17.592
Wet means a match.

22:17.889 --> 22:18.889
I'm a winner.

22:19.002 --> 22:20.190
Paul, let's do this.

22:22.145 --> 22:23.720
So, the fog can't
be helped, but police say

22:23.723 --> 22:25.898
they can get a chopper out to
T.C. and them in 20 minutes.

22:25.922 --> 22:28.014
They're still stuck out there?!
This is getting ridiculous.

22:28.033 --> 22:29.892
But we got good news on the
home front with Blake here.

22:29.906 --> 22:31.183
Pulse ox is up, pressure's down,

22:31.207 --> 22:32.787
so it looks like we're winning the war.

22:37.534 --> 22:38.935
Just tell them what you know, okay?

22:39.233 --> 22:40.636
Tell them. Just tell them.

22:40.803 --> 22:42.973
You got him breathing. Good job.

22:42.975 --> 22:44.762
Just be outside in case we need you.

23:07.016 --> 23:08.515
Topher, I said he's getting better.

23:10.701 --> 23:11.938
And I say he's not.

23:11.976 --> 23:13.395
Anything can still happen...

23:13.444 --> 23:15.477
pneumo, arrhythmia, infection.

23:15.487 --> 23:17.132
I think you'd be more cautious

23:17.149 --> 23:18.689
since you missed this originally.

23:19.283 --> 23:21.156
How many more times am I
gonna have to hear that?

23:21.180 --> 23:22.180
I know I missed it.

23:23.684 --> 23:25.027
I bet you missed your first case, too,

23:25.030 --> 23:26.951
which is probably why you
won't tell me about it.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.091
It seems to be working.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.747
Pulse rate is holding at 120.

23:34.993 --> 23:36.609
You are <i> un héroe, ¿no?</i>

23:37.763 --> 23:40.241
Will you tell her I'm just doing my job.

23:40.789 --> 23:42.007
He's very stubborn.

23:42.123 --> 23:43.272
<i>Como un burro.</i>

23:43.387 --> 23:44.328
Tee, listen to me.

23:44.330 --> 23:45.700
This isn't Kandahar.

23:45.707 --> 23:47.452
You don't have to take the same risks here.

23:47.547 --> 23:49.034
If we just wait, then we can...

23:49.045 --> 23:50.839
Then Hector will bleed out and die.

23:51.198 --> 23:53.344
Look, the oath says, "do no harm."

23:53.635 --> 23:55.478
I didn't write it, but I took it.

23:55.943 --> 23:58.826
The oath also says, "I
must not play at god."

24:00.261 --> 24:01.409
Look, some cases, you fight for.

24:01.433 --> 24:03.574
And some cases, you just have to let go.

24:03.613 --> 24:05.814
Okay, Jordan, the helicopter
will be here in 10 minutes.

24:05.860 --> 24:07.040
They'll have some fresh blood for Hector,

24:07.063 --> 24:08.191
and then I'll let go.

24:13.807 --> 24:15.429
Kenny? Tell me something good.

24:15.807 --> 24:17.998
I wish I had better news.
The fog is still heavy.

24:18.009 --> 24:20.149
They've grounded every
flight for three counties.

24:20.264 --> 24:22.237
Well, what about a medevac from the base?

24:22.267 --> 24:23.566
Right, right, I'm working on it.

24:23.568 --> 24:26.043
But it's gonna take time, and
they're saying about an hour.

24:26.674 --> 24:27.459
Sorry, Jordan.

24:27.523 --> 24:28.885
Okay.

24:28.942 --> 24:30.655
It's not gonna be 10 minutes.
It's gonna be an hour.

24:30.675 --> 24:31.707
- I'm cutting your line.
- No. No.

24:31.731 --> 24:33.567
No one's coming anytime soon.

24:33.589 --> 24:36.033
T.C., if you lose over 2
liters of blood, you'll die.

24:36.097 --> 24:37.842
That's... that's in less than an hour.

24:38.043 --> 24:40.631
Well then, we... we
better think of something else,

24:40.782 --> 24:43.299
'cause I'm... I'm not cutting this line.

24:51.397 --> 24:52.418
Where are they?

24:52.881 --> 24:53.881
Relax.

24:54.288 --> 24:55.856
The chopper will get here in time.

24:55.971 --> 24:56.971
I'll be fine.

24:57.731 --> 25:02.948
Paul, help me
lift my legs up by my head.

25:03.064 --> 25:06.766
Should, uh, keep the
blood closer to my heart.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.920
Buy us some more time.

25:10.154 --> 25:12.144
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

25:12.183 --> 25:13.183
Hey.

25:13.648 --> 25:14.648
I love you.

25:15.018 --> 25:17.069
Okay, I love you so much,

25:17.794 --> 25:19.595
but you are killing yourself.

25:19.628 --> 25:21.358
I'm just trying to save his life.

25:21.764 --> 25:22.765
I know.

25:22.823 --> 25:25.859
Hey, if you were out
here alone with this man,

25:26.453 --> 25:27.914
would you just let him die?

25:28.145 --> 25:29.897
I'd do everything I could.

25:30.533 --> 25:31.747
There you go.

25:38.747 --> 25:40.504
Chopper's out to T.C. and Jordan.

25:42.373 --> 25:43.724
Hey, don't kill the messenger,

25:43.743 --> 25:45.278
but the mom's out in the hallway.

25:45.634 --> 25:46.697
Joey let her see Abby.

25:46.716 --> 25:47.938
She wants to see Blake.

25:48.201 --> 25:49.172
He did that?

25:49.183 --> 25:50.394
He wanted to calm her down.

25:50.557 --> 25:51.604
She just got pretty scared

25:51.635 --> 25:53.516
about her daughter up in the O.R., so...

25:54.378 --> 25:55.279
If you got any good news...

25:55.306 --> 25:57.537
I'm not here to make people feel good.

25:57.610 --> 25:59.152
I'm here to save them.

25:59.880 --> 26:00.880
Topher, I'm...

26:01.990 --> 26:04.280
I'm just trying to help the mom, okay?

26:04.934 --> 26:06.190
Can't just bite my head off.

26:06.224 --> 26:07.518
Okay, you are the P.A.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.146
I am the chief attending.

26:09.186 --> 26:10.525
I can do whatever I want.

26:10.893 --> 26:11.893
Hey...

26:13.166 --> 26:14.577
I don't know what the
hell is wrong with you

26:14.601 --> 26:16.315
or why you're acting so odd tonight,

26:16.430 --> 26:17.992
but you can imagine
what she's going through,

26:18.016 --> 26:19.915
so let her see her son for one damn minute.

26:23.295 --> 26:24.402
I'm sorry. I just...

26:25.237 --> 26:26.336
Of course, send her in.

26:30.936 --> 26:33.925
Rebecca, this is, uh, Dr. Zia.

26:34.224 --> 26:35.469
I'll leave you two alone.

26:41.789 --> 26:43.675
Michael says you've been
working on Blake for hours.

26:43.699 --> 26:44.744
He's not talking yet.

26:45.168 --> 26:46.168
Talking?

26:47.586 --> 26:48.691
Uh, stable.

26:48.724 --> 26:50.104
I meant, stable.

26:54.275 --> 26:55.892
When I left for work, Blake
told me they'd stay home

26:55.910 --> 26:57.563
and watch cartoons.

26:58.273 --> 26:59.548
If I'd stayed for two more minutes,

26:59.557 --> 27:00.938
I would have seen them leave.

27:04.630 --> 27:05.791
You can't control everything.

27:09.335 --> 27:11.078
Sometimes bad things just happen.

27:15.084 --> 27:16.966
Excuse me. S... stay as long as you like.

27:43.933 --> 27:46.945
W... was he Taliban?

27:46.973 --> 27:49.291
Did you get what you needed?

27:49.716 --> 27:51.212
Maybe.

27:51.327 --> 27:52.626
Not sure.

28:02.022 --> 28:03.503
Why save him?

28:03.618 --> 28:05.153
He is <i> un monstro.</i>

28:05.953 --> 28:07.815
<i>Porque el es un doctor.</i>

28:08.545 --> 28:10.106
It's his job.

28:14.189 --> 28:15.372
You're fading.

28:16.304 --> 28:18.374
The second you go out,
I am pulling that line.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.373
Oh, no, no, I'm... I'm good.

28:20.792 --> 28:21.793
I'm good.

28:22.289 --> 28:25.132
Paul, um, the story. Where was I?

28:25.889 --> 28:28.284
Uh, you were... you were at the fire.

28:28.399 --> 28:29.319
- Mm.
- Um,

28:29.348 --> 28:31.388
- you broke the window and... and went in.
- Mm-hmm.

28:31.682 --> 28:32.894
What happened when you got in there?

28:32.918 --> 28:33.918
No idea.

28:34.335 --> 28:35.425
I blacked out.

28:36.379 --> 28:38.846
I was messed up pretty bad.

28:38.961 --> 28:40.439
Smoke. Whew.

28:41.060 --> 28:43.323
So, I came to in a... in a tent,

28:43.752 --> 28:46.554
next to the guy who I tried to save.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.931
And I was worse off than he was.

28:49.290 --> 28:50.290
Um...

28:50.659 --> 28:54.408
The guy I tried to save... he
ended up dragging <i> me</i> out.

28:54.731 --> 28:55.731
No way.

28:55.843 --> 28:57.932
Sad, but true.

28:58.683 --> 28:59.959
Um

29:00.266 --> 29:02.473
That's not the best part.

29:02.588 --> 29:03.710
What was the best part?

29:05.099 --> 29:08.008
In the tent standing above us,

29:08.362 --> 29:10.115
bringing me back to life

29:10.604 --> 29:14.605
was the most beautiful
woman I had ever seen.

29:17.789 --> 29:19.875
I was cold.

29:20.055 --> 29:23.417
Uh, and she had this little pink sweater,

29:23.532 --> 29:25.446
and she gave it to me...

29:25.617 --> 29:29.213
this... this really
nice, small, pink sweater.

29:29.328 --> 29:30.734
I was like...

29:31.567 --> 29:34.273
Do you, uh, still have
that pink sweater, Jordan?

29:36.477 --> 29:37.947
Pulse is up. We're losing him.

29:38.761 --> 29:41.149
Come on, Tee, stay with me.

29:48.105 --> 29:49.106
T.C.?

29:49.667 --> 29:51.355
- Huh?
- Tee, can you hear me?

29:52.401 --> 29:54.127
Your pulse is weak, but
you're gonna be okay.

29:54.151 --> 29:55.438
No, no, don't.

29:55.553 --> 29:57.470
Don't move. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

29:57.472 --> 29:59.006
Hector's crashing!

29:59.482 --> 30:01.132
Okay, I'll start CPR.

30:04.131 --> 30:06.193
Paul, a little help.

30:06.308 --> 30:08.445
Yeah, uh, coming, coming. Uh...

30:09.621 --> 30:10.465
Hey, try this.

30:10.498 --> 30:12.110
Cough medicine... pseudoephedrine,

30:12.130 --> 30:13.595
should work like adrenaline
and start his heart up again.

30:13.619 --> 30:14.868
Let's give it a try.

30:18.628 --> 30:20.484
I need some attending signatures...

30:20.740 --> 30:22.176
Then I'll be on my way.

30:24.444 --> 30:25.508
Yeah, sure.

30:28.005 --> 30:29.281
H... hey, um...

30:30.181 --> 30:31.181
Listen...

30:32.100 --> 30:33.919
I'm... I'm sorry I was a dick.

30:35.304 --> 30:36.606
Sorry you were, too.

30:38.188 --> 30:39.917
Look, if you need to talk,

30:40.219 --> 30:41.579
get something off your chest,

30:42.100 --> 30:43.101
I'm here.

30:47.529 --> 30:49.178
I... I'm a good person.

30:54.218 --> 30:55.218
Yeah.

30:56.798 --> 30:57.799
I know that.

30:59.474 --> 31:01.070
You... you ever do anything

31:01.097 --> 31:03.257
back there that you weren't so proud of?

31:04.743 --> 31:05.744
More than once.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.176
We stayed in our lane,
we did what we were told.

31:08.381 --> 31:09.588
Maybe we shouldn't have.

31:09.765 --> 31:11.179
Too easy to say from here.

31:12.542 --> 31:15.002
It's not so easy over
there. Different rules.

31:19.123 --> 31:21.500
I... I... I just don't know
if I did the right thing.

31:24.409 --> 31:26.381
I...

31:31.761 --> 31:33.550
Did they get what they needed?

31:36.497 --> 31:37.754
Topher?

31:39.013 --> 31:40.770
Did they get what they needed?

31:44.531 --> 31:46.066
I guess I'll never know.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.058
Ah.

31:57.092 --> 31:59.333
It'll be a few months
before she's fully mobile,

31:59.369 --> 32:00.369
but she's fine.

32:00.491 --> 32:03.508
We are so lucky. I can't thank you enough.

32:03.510 --> 32:04.691
It's our pleasure.

32:05.159 --> 32:06.160
Really.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.753
Ooh, that was intense.

32:10.939 --> 32:13.077
Yeah. I'm just glad she's okay.

32:13.942 --> 32:15.408
You really don't sweat it, do you?

32:15.523 --> 32:16.657
It's all in the breathing.

32:16.719 --> 32:17.861
- Oh.
- Hmm?

32:17.914 --> 32:19.023
Look, once upon a time,

32:19.045 --> 32:21.693
I was wound up tighter than
you or anybody else I know.

32:21.701 --> 32:23.031
I am not that uptight.

32:23.033 --> 32:24.152
Yeah.

32:24.154 --> 32:25.792
Okay. Okay, whatever.

32:25.907 --> 32:27.108
So... so, what worked for you?

32:27.259 --> 32:28.835
Zen? Yoga?

32:28.887 --> 32:29.946
Yeah, they helped.

32:30.291 --> 32:31.545
They weren't the catalyst.

32:31.592 --> 32:32.723
So, what?

32:32.838 --> 32:34.645
I mean, like, stop playing coy.

32:35.496 --> 32:36.510
When I know you better.

32:36.551 --> 32:37.425
Oh, come on!

32:37.479 --> 32:38.969
You've been digging into
me this entire shift.

32:38.993 --> 32:40.207
And you can't tell me?

32:42.728 --> 32:44.468
I lost my son to cancer.

32:46.983 --> 32:48.728
Yeah, it was before I went to Iraq.

32:49.348 --> 32:50.554
He was 9.

32:51.417 --> 32:53.747
We did everything... you
know, surgeries, chemo.

32:53.796 --> 32:56.839
I saw the limitations of
Western medicine, of myself,

32:57.191 --> 33:00.028
and I... I started exploring new

33:00.330 --> 33:02.385
ways of thought, new ways of living,

33:02.547 --> 33:04.652
realized that there's so much we can do

33:04.675 --> 33:05.843
before we get sick.

33:06.467 --> 33:08.518
You know, I've... anyway,
I'm... I'm rambling.

33:08.633 --> 33:10.780
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

33:10.895 --> 33:12.444
- I had no idea. I'm...
- I'm sorry.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.661
It's... I shouldn't
have dumped that on you.

33:13.685 --> 33:14.806
No, no.

33:16.012 --> 33:18.450
Um, look, I don't tell very many people,

33:18.565 --> 33:20.045
- so if you could just...
- Of course.

33:20.629 --> 33:21.629
Yeah.

33:23.774 --> 33:25.197
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

33:36.410 --> 33:38.317
Come on. Come on.

33:38.661 --> 33:40.000
I got a pulse.

33:40.398 --> 33:42.239
Paul, your hail mary
might have just saved him.

33:42.525 --> 33:44.463
Now let's get him on that chopper.

33:44.578 --> 33:46.876
Hey. Hey, Carla's awake.

33:47.096 --> 33:48.462
Go.

33:49.176 --> 33:51.462
It's okay. I got you. Hey, I got you, okay?

33:51.526 --> 33:52.672
All right.

33:54.644 --> 33:56.282
What the holy hell?

33:56.331 --> 33:57.245
Long story.

33:57.315 --> 33:58.419
Always is.

33:58.434 --> 34:00.390
All right, three to
transport, all in critical.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.431
- We need hep-lock, saline, oxygen at the ready.
- It's okay.

34:02.455 --> 34:03.887
- Don't touch it.
- Let's get o-neg going on these two.

34:03.905 --> 34:04.915
- Leave the hook alone.
- T.C. first.

34:04.926 --> 34:05.650
Damn it!

34:05.679 --> 34:07.481
- Hook's out. A little help here?
- I'm on it.

34:08.338 --> 34:10.241
Ana is the coyote.

34:10.306 --> 34:11.827
Don't move. We're gonna...

34:11.849 --> 34:13.081
- we're gonna help you breathe, okay?
- Hold on a sec,

34:13.106 --> 34:14.172
hold on a second.

34:14.614 --> 34:15.485
What did you just say?

34:15.527 --> 34:17.552
Ana is the coyote.

34:17.748 --> 34:18.438
She lied.

34:18.491 --> 34:20.395
She's the bad one, not Hector.

34:20.561 --> 34:23.164
She took us, threatened our family.

34:23.279 --> 34:25.563
She was going to sell us.

34:25.587 --> 34:28.482
Ana is very bad. Ana is cartel.

34:28.597 --> 34:29.848
Hey, wait! No!

34:34.116 --> 34:36.951
Police found a guy shot
in the head near the bait shop.

34:36.996 --> 34:39.146
According to the FBI, your
Ana fit the description

34:39.149 --> 34:40.659
of a woman who's a trafficker.

34:41.053 --> 34:42.922
Cops found a track mark on Oscar

34:42.929 --> 34:44.889
and a syringe outside the bait shop.

34:45.005 --> 34:46.536
Tested positive for heroin.

34:46.650 --> 34:48.623
Ana must have injected
him when I went outside.

34:48.782 --> 34:49.783
Wow. I...

34:50.474 --> 34:53.114
Paul, I am so sorry for doubting you.

34:53.398 --> 34:55.505
No problem. I, uh, I doubted myself.

34:55.873 --> 34:57.136
Anyways, we're lucky.

34:57.163 --> 34:58.930
Cops say Ana is wanted in four states.

34:58.945 --> 35:00.925
For human trafficking and murder.

35:01.227 --> 35:02.438
My god.

35:03.342 --> 35:05.552
I think I'm gonna check
on Carla and Hector again.

35:05.667 --> 35:07.478
They're stable, and Unicef is helping

35:07.547 --> 35:08.716
track down their family.

35:08.781 --> 35:10.396
- Um, T.C. doing all right?
- Yeah,

35:10.434 --> 35:11.297
he's gonna be fine.

35:11.354 --> 35:12.247
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:12.314 --> 35:13.506
- Catch you later.
- Yeah.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.555
That's quite a chance T.C. took out there.

35:17.635 --> 35:19.489
So glad he's changed.

35:19.734 --> 35:21.415
Gwen, he <i> has</i> changed.

35:21.430 --> 35:22.891
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe

35:23.119 --> 35:26.134
not 100%, but he's trying.

35:26.179 --> 35:27.301
Trying for what?

35:27.720 --> 35:30.493
Hey, my job is to protect
you, not him, okay?

35:30.549 --> 35:31.627
Got it.

35:49.806 --> 35:56.990
* with a thousand tries,
you'll understand *

35:58.017 --> 36:01.643
* and kick the can *

36:19.623 --> 36:27.532
* fools waste time *

36:27.775 --> 36:35.327
* as moons chased light *

36:35.442 --> 36:38.040
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:38.155 --> 36:46.155
* With a heavy heart,
you know what's next *

36:46.813 --> 36:50.096
- * with steady hands *
- Tee, you really scared me tonight.

36:50.211 --> 36:53.606
Aw. I'm alive.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.055
Look, if we're gonna do this,

36:57.092 --> 36:59.435
there's a hell of a lot
that we need to figure out.

36:59.491 --> 37:00.905
- * In words you've penned *
- Like?

37:01.107 --> 37:03.742
Like how we're gonna work
together now that we're together.

37:04.968 --> 37:07.999
I can't focus on my job
if I'm worried about you.

37:08.406 --> 37:09.999
T.C. and Jordan are not the same

37:10.042 --> 37:11.987
as Dr. Callahan and Dr. Alexander,

37:12.025 --> 37:13.349
so we need to find the line.

37:13.368 --> 37:14.310
We'll find it.

37:14.376 --> 37:16.768
- * Just kick the can *
- We found it before.

37:16.939 --> 37:19.592
We were residents, okay?

37:19.839 --> 37:21.167
Kids.

37:21.219 --> 37:23.913
- We're adults now. It's different.
- Come on, Gwen.

37:24.378 --> 37:26.663
Bring Jordan back, please.

37:27.789 --> 37:29.983
- I'm just saying that you can be...
- And I'm just saying

37:30.007 --> 37:32.264
that I would still do anything for you

37:33.153 --> 37:36.847
And that you are still so gullible.

37:37.745 --> 37:38.929
Oh, yeah?

37:39.044 --> 37:41.000
You're just annoyed because
you bought Ana's story...

37:41.024 --> 37:43.317
- Mm-hmm.
- Hook, line, and sinker.

37:43.361 --> 37:44.931
- How about you shut up?
- Uh-huh.

37:44.973 --> 37:49.898
* You can't pretend *

37:50.508 --> 37:55.744
* wouldn't you like to love? *

37:56.316 --> 37:56.983
Oh!

37:57.154 --> 37:59.093
T... that is so not how
you play bumper pool.

37:59.107 --> 38:00.734
Okay.

38:00.805 --> 38:01.671
Get a room.

38:01.694 --> 38:03.753
So, I heard some idiot
gave away half his blood.

38:04.135 --> 38:06.339
T.C., you ever
read "The Giving Tree"?

38:06.454 --> 38:07.312
Doesn't end well.

38:07.427 --> 38:09.679
- You, uh, you hear anything?
- Not a thing.

38:09.934 --> 38:12.654
- Let's, uh, get a room. Yeah.
- Get a room.

38:12.769 --> 38:14.792
Yeah. Come on. Hyah!

38:14.844 --> 38:16.621
The storage room is open, y'alls.

38:16.645 --> 38:18.935
There's a locker room
that's not always occupied.

38:19.050 --> 38:21.211
- Let's go.
- Let's pretend this table was not touched.
