00:00.750 --> 00:03.915
That man! He has stirred up the mob,
he has set them on a rampage!

00:03.917 --> 00:05.892
Well, what did you expect,
when you closed a working mine?

00:05.894 --> 00:08.838
Have a care.
You may be taken at your word.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.158
This is not London.
Do you suppose there are spies here?

00:11.160 --> 00:13.798
Dear God, the twisted quirk of fate
that gives the girl I love

00:13.800 --> 00:15.758
-to the man I loathe.
-George?

00:15.760 --> 00:16.998
If that is what you desire.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.358
I do not believe
I will feel desire ever again.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.158
Is it really so terrible?
The thought of a child?

00:22.160 --> 00:24.718
No. But the loss is.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.958
Can a mother truly forget
a son she birthed?

00:26.960 --> 00:29.278
I am your mistress no longer, Tess.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.840
Pack your things and go.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.918
I think the time has come
to return Ned to Honduras.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.520
I think 'tis for the best.

01:31.480 --> 01:34.318
We've served our penance
for embarrassing the crown

01:34.320 --> 01:36.880
and the Prime Minister has
signalled his support.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.518
With any luck, those who conspired
against him have now lost interest

01:42.520 --> 01:44.118
and, besides,

01:44.120 --> 01:47.600
the longer he remains in Cornwall,
the more restless he becomes.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.998
In truth, he has made himself
almost as unpopular

01:54.000 --> 01:57.438
with the powers that be here
as he did in London.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.760
He has been that unruly
these last few months.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.318
'Tis the best for Kitty too.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.480
Indeed.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.600
I promise he will
depart with the New year.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.118
Doubtless you'll be reporting him
to Wickham?

02:18.120 --> 02:19.678
At the earliest opportunity!

02:19.680 --> 02:23.198
Then let's hope 'twill pass without
consequence.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.718
Yes.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.438
And it's Cornwall,

02:26.440 --> 02:29.518
and it's Christmas

02:29.520 --> 02:32.518
and folk have better things
to think about.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.158
Here's to our imminent
return to London!

02:35.160 --> 02:36.318
-To London.
-London.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.600
And Honduras.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.718
# Boar's head in hand bear I,

02:43.720 --> 02:45.360
# Bedecked with bay and rosemary

02:46.680 --> 02:48.000
# Caput apri defero,

02:50.320 --> 02:51.560
# Reddens laudes domino

02:53.360 --> 02:54.600
# Caput apri defero... #

02:57.040 --> 02:58.078
Bye!

02:58.080 --> 02:59.440
-Bye, Papa!
-Goodbye, Papa!

03:01.440 --> 03:03.878
Why do you not go to London, Mama?

03:03.880 --> 03:05.318
If I did, who would see to Cornwall?

03:05.320 --> 03:06.878
And us!

03:06.880 --> 03:08.320
Especially you!

03:12.120 --> 03:14.758
I wonder if we'll ever see
Cornwall again.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.240
I sincerely hope not.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.640
He means, with any luck, we should
soon be bound for the West Indies.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.038
If Ross is set on escorting
Ned to London,

03:28.040 --> 03:29.518
I must be there to keep watch.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.838
Of course, Ross would not suspect
me.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.438
I am a vacuous creature,

03:33.440 --> 03:36.158
my inability to survive without
London fashions is well known.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.998
Well, I have no such excuse,

03:38.000 --> 03:41.278
and he will know I come to London
with one purpose only.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.800
Walk on.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.120
I'm sure Kitty will
appreciate the gesture.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.000
More scholars than ever!

04:03.640 --> 04:06.998
Plenty's open, Grace a-thriving.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.758
You know 'tis maybe time
to start asking folk

04:09.760 --> 04:11.358
for a share of their earnings,

04:11.360 --> 04:12.478
help build our school?

04:12.480 --> 04:13.840
Reckon so.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.678
I?

04:18.680 --> 04:20.918
Folk heed Preacher Carne.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.478
When he's about God's work.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.358
Is this not God's work?

04:24.360 --> 04:26.520
'Tis good work, but not holy work.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.278
Besides, the connection teaches
that all men be equal.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.158
How then can
I declare myself the leader?

04:32.160 --> 04:34.598
But someone must take the lead.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.118
And not every man have the wisdom
and the selflessness

04:37.120 --> 04:39.518
to take authority.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.880
But you do.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.358
Our business empire is
built in the colonies,

04:52.360 --> 04:54.840
so these uprisings threaten
its very existence.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.678
The government must continue
to support the slave trade.

04:58.680 --> 05:02.158
And I'm sure Sir George will prove
most able in our cause.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.878
No, if you'd secured his signature
on that contract!

05:04.880 --> 05:06.318
It's time I met him.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.918
Yes, yes, of course.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.320
Of course.

05:13.560 --> 05:17.558
Sir, I believe the Prime Minister
and I are of one mind -

05:17.560 --> 05:21.198
predisposed to justice,
equality, liberty.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.718
Let me, in his name,
return to Honduras

05:24.720 --> 05:28.238
and rid it of the corrupt influences
which have flourished in my absence.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.518
I need hardly say that I seek not
authority for its own sake,

05:32.520 --> 05:35.918
but for the good I can do managing
any rebellion in the service

05:35.920 --> 05:37.278
of the Crown.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.998
And the Prime Minister would thank
you for such service, and might

05:40.000 --> 05:44.478
indeed endorse your reinstatement,
were it not for one thing.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.240
It's no longer in his gift.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.558
Because?

05:49.560 --> 05:51.480
He's no longer Prime Minister.

05:53.760 --> 05:54.798
What?

05:54.800 --> 05:58.998
In protest at His Majesty's refusal
to endorse Catholic emancipation,

05:59.000 --> 06:00.880
he has this very day resigned.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.038
This way, my dear.

06:11.040 --> 06:14.878
I have a matter of some delicacy
to communicate.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.080
A little port?

06:17.120 --> 06:18.280
Will I need it?

06:19.680 --> 06:22.878
The fact is a surprising -

06:22.880 --> 06:28.078
some would say disquieting -
situation has arisen.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.598
Gold being in ever-decreasing
supply,

06:31.600 --> 06:36.878
the Cornish Bank has been obliged to
issue paper instead of coin.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.200
Paper?

06:39.720 --> 06:42.078
I don't rightly understand.

06:42.080 --> 06:47.958
The paper is in effect a promise to
pay the bearer the same value

06:47.960 --> 06:54.078
as writ upon the note, so it is in
effect worth the same as hard coin.

06:54.080 --> 06:59.160
This watermark here guarantees its
value and authenticity.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.958
Well, will folk believe it?

07:02.960 --> 07:06.198
There may be some initial suspicion.

07:06.200 --> 07:10.400
I should add, we're not the only
bank to take this decision.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.758
Even Warleggan's...

07:12.760 --> 07:15.118
Oh, and there was I about to
trot off to George and ask him

07:15.120 --> 07:16.718
to hand over hard guineas!

07:16.720 --> 07:22.040
I'm afraid, while the war continues,
no-one has gold to be giving away.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.198
My sweet boy!

08:19.400 --> 08:21.398
Now the Prime Minister has resigned,

08:21.400 --> 08:22.798
who will be Pitt's successor?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.558
Addington.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.878
A friend of his, but cut from a very
different cloth.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.998
Should we petition him?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.038
At once.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.318
Before he becomes distracted
by grovelling to Napoleon.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.078
Dwight, Caroline, you're in London!

08:35.080 --> 08:36.357
How did we not know this?

08:36.360 --> 08:37.518
My fault entirely.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.518
Necklines are lower,
waistlines are higher,

08:39.520 --> 08:42.398
and my gowns are out of fashion,
so there was no remedy but to make

08:42.400 --> 08:43.919
for London without delay.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.758
So Pitt's resigned.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.958
Yes, it's a bitter blow for Ned,

08:49.960 --> 08:52.998
but I'll pursue his cause
with Addington.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.718
Is that wise?

08:54.720 --> 08:56.678
Rumours of George's injury are
everywhere.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.798
In Cornwall he took every
opportunity to parade his arm,

08:59.800 --> 09:02.718
and to complain how Ned "broke into
his house and threw him downstairs."

09:02.720 --> 09:04.358
We both know he did not.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.838
Do we know that?

09:05.840 --> 09:07.998
Ned assured us.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.798
Surely, you can see that continuing
to champion a man who assaulted

09:10.800 --> 09:13.918
a Member of Parliament could
severely compromise you?

09:13.920 --> 09:16.038
Yes, I can see that.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.280
And it's a chance I'm willing
to take.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.240
Ross...

09:25.160 --> 09:27.040
Would you like a pamphlet, sir?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.998
Uprising in Haiti as well?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.238
Damn plaguey revolution!

09:32.240 --> 09:35.358
Now every slave on Earth will want
their liberty!

09:35.360 --> 09:39.678
And they may get it too, thanks to
meddling idiots like Wilberforce.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.798
And Despard.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.838
Ah!

09:41.840 --> 09:45.038
Not while there are those
in the House ready to muster

09:45.040 --> 09:47.360
a stiff rebuff.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.840
News of the uprising, sir?

09:58.960 --> 09:59.998
Influence?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.718
Yes, sir, with the new
Prime Minister, Addington,

10:02.720 --> 10:08.078
and - as magistrate who presided
over Colonel Despard's hearing -

10:08.080 --> 10:10.998
might you help persuade
the Prime Minister to return Ned

10:11.000 --> 10:12.560
to his post as governor?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.560
Such things do happen.

10:16.720 --> 10:21.238
However, you may overestimate
my power of influence.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.278
Let me see what can be done.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.878
But, erm...

10:24.880 --> 10:27.518
..I recommend you have
an alternative plan,

10:27.520 --> 10:28.880
just in case.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.478
Thank you, sir.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.598
So I'm trapped here
while slavery flourishes,

10:36.600 --> 10:40.200
and in my own country, Catholics
remain equally oppressed.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.958
The King's stubbornness
beggars belief.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.758
And my family are Protestant
landowners,

10:46.760 --> 10:50.038
but why should that allow them
to vote, hold public office,

10:50.040 --> 10:52.720
own property, when their
Catholic neighbours may not?

10:54.240 --> 10:55.998
He should take to the stage.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.960
He certainly knows how to hold
an audience.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.998
Will you not intervene?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.358
These opinions, which he
takes no pains to disguise...

11:05.360 --> 11:06.718
Are sincere!

11:06.720 --> 11:08.118
Why should he not speak them?

11:08.120 --> 11:10.440
Without these rights, they're
no better than slaves.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.678
And slavery is an abomination.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.718
Colonel Despard...

11:14.720 --> 11:16.598
We happen to agree with him
but others do not,

11:16.600 --> 11:18.758
and to be seen in public to be
openly critical of King

11:18.760 --> 11:21.598
-and country...
-I agree - sometimes, his passion get the better of him.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.558
-Ned?
-Is that not unjust...
-Ned!

11:24.560 --> 11:26.038
Have a care.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.638
It takes little to be called
a revolutionary these days.

11:28.640 --> 11:32.318
We must make our voices heard -
and I've little to lose,

11:32.320 --> 11:35.518
so what harm can it do to say what
everyone else is thinking?

11:35.520 --> 11:37.598
The King is mad!

11:48.440 --> 11:51.998
Gentlemen, may I present
my esteemed partner in

11:52.000 --> 11:55.958
the Mosquito Shore Mahogany Company,
Mr Joseph Merceron?

11:55.960 --> 11:58.560
And soon to be your esteemed
partner, gentlemen.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.160
I believe you know Ross Poldark.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.600
Thank you.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.720
Here we are.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.320
What in the 'obs of 'ell
do you call this?

12:32.080 --> 12:34.838
As we did fear,
they'll 'ave none of it.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.398
It isn't real money, they say.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.798
Says who?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.078
Tess Tregidden?

12:39.080 --> 12:40.840
And who's to gainsay 'er?

12:41.760 --> 12:43.318
This isn't your fight, Tess.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.278
This is betwix' the mine
and its workers.

12:45.280 --> 12:48.318
Its workers, who must now make do
with worthless paper,

12:48.320 --> 12:49.758
instead o' hard coin?

12:49.760 --> 12:50.998
The worth is the same!

12:51.000 --> 12:53.558
-If you read what's writ thereon...
-I can't read.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.878
Then perhaps you should learn.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.558
What I know is, if twas me,

12:57.560 --> 13:02.360
I'd not lift another pick or shovel
till I'd real money in my 'and.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.798
They truly believe it isn't real?

13:14.800 --> 13:16.198
Oh, 'tis real enough!

13:16.200 --> 13:18.678
In Truro, all the banks be giving
them out.

13:18.680 --> 13:21.158
So why did thee pretend to
Mistress Poldark?

13:21.160 --> 13:23.120
Why should I make life easy for 'er?

13:26.040 --> 13:28.478
But I could make it harder.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.918
An' better for we.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.318
Hm?

13:31.320 --> 13:35.120
How hard can it be to
make like notes?

13:36.960 --> 13:39.400
Do we not know a man with
the needful skillage?

13:40.840 --> 13:42.118
Mr Trencrom.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.640
Do he not have a man
who can forge documents?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.760
Knows we'd makes it worth his while.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.440
Then let's make it worth 'is while!

13:53.360 --> 13:57.318
Well, they've not downed tools yet
but they'll take some convincing

13:57.320 --> 13:59.038
about the value of their notes.

13:59.040 --> 14:03.438
Ah, especially with Missy Tregidden
spewing poison in their ears!

14:03.440 --> 14:05.998
I dearly wish Ross were here
to advise me.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.238
Beg your pardon,

14:08.240 --> 14:11.198
but I believe you underestimate
yourself.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.318
Do I?

14:12.320 --> 14:15.438
If there's a more capable woman
in these parts,

14:15.440 --> 14:16.880
I've yet to meet her.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.678
I arrived in London last night
and thought I would call to see

14:30.680 --> 14:32.240
how your recovery goes.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.760
As you see.

14:37.800 --> 14:40.198
No thanks to the madman who
pitched me down my own stairs!

14:40.200 --> 14:42.838
Ah, no, I was actually referring
to your other indisposition...

14:42.840 --> 14:43.880
Fully recovered.

14:45.520 --> 14:49.318
A lucky consequence of the fall,
no doubt.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.798
I'm presenting a paper to
the Royal College of Surgeons -

14:51.800 --> 14:54.198
without naming Sir George,
of course -

14:54.200 --> 14:56.878
detailing the various treatments
which enabled his recovery.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.518
Should this paper,

14:59.520 --> 15:04.078
indeed any further mention of
the subject, ever occur,

15:04.080 --> 15:09.118
I will cheerfully sue you and
your charming wife for every

15:09.120 --> 15:10.440
penny you possess.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.720
Good day.

15:21.520 --> 15:26.718
These recent slave uprisings
in the West Indies must be a concern

15:26.720 --> 15:28.878
to all of us at home,

15:28.880 --> 15:31.320
and surely requires our attention.

15:33.160 --> 15:38.118
It is intolerable that human beings
should be sold into slavery.

15:38.120 --> 15:42.318
Yet it still continues, to the
detriment of humanity...

15:42.320 --> 15:43.838
Order, order!

15:43.840 --> 15:48.118
Therefore it is the responsibility
of everyone of us in this House

15:48.120 --> 15:53.478
today to table a motion to discuss
slavery, its long overdue abolition,

15:53.480 --> 15:56.200
and show some compassion
for these slaves!

16:22.720 --> 16:24.160
Who is Jonas Pettigrew?

16:25.480 --> 16:28.600
He is the new assistant overseer
on the North Plantation.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.200
Clearly unsuited for the task,
given his squeamishness.

16:33.600 --> 16:37.360
"Sir, your enterprise here is no
less than a grove of death.

16:38.400 --> 16:43.598
"I counted 57 souls in the most
pitiable state, begging for water in

16:43.600 --> 16:47.280
"their death throes and being denied
it in order to hasten their demise."

16:48.520 --> 16:49.560
And?

16:50.760 --> 16:51.800
Precisely.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.680
Get rid of him.

17:17.240 --> 17:20.958
Jesus tells us 'tis easier for
a camel to pass through the eye of

17:20.960 --> 17:25.000
a needle than 'tis for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.078
Here we be not rich
in worldly goods,

17:29.080 --> 17:32.158
but how if we were rich
in knowledge?

17:32.160 --> 17:35.078
Would that not greatly serve us?

17:35.080 --> 17:39.118
And would it not be worth laying out
a little of our earnings to gain it?

17:39.120 --> 17:42.638
We could build our school,
pay for teachers, books...

17:42.640 --> 17:46.678
And in return, our children
would have the means to rise,

17:46.680 --> 17:49.160
and claim parity
with their richer fellows.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.600
My love, I know where you've been.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.078
Do it not torment 'ee,
being so near the child,

18:08.080 --> 18:09.800
yet not able to bring 'im home?

18:16.760 --> 18:18.120
It breaks my heart.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.758
But how could I expect it?

18:23.760 --> 18:27.000
To ask you to take in another man's
child?

18:29.160 --> 18:30.400
Especially...

18:32.560 --> 18:34.240
..that man.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.958
It would not be his child...

18:40.960 --> 18:42.520
..if he came to us.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.800
Drake...

18:49.760 --> 18:50.958
..forgive me.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.878
For what?

18:52.880 --> 18:55.118
-That I've not been able...
-Morwenna.

18:55.120 --> 18:58.720
-..may never be able...
-My love.
-..to give you a child of our own.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.880
Will 'ee not believe it?

19:05.120 --> 19:09.680
To know that you're my wife
is more than enough.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.958
Good day to you, children.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.198
Good day, Mrs Carne.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.958
Shall we proceed to our lessons?

19:27.960 --> 19:29.760
Yes, Mrs Carne.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.520
Drake Carne...to see her Ladyship.

20:10.400 --> 20:16.198
Your Ladyship, I come
in all humility to ask,

20:16.200 --> 20:21.160
is it right for a mother to be
parted from her son?

20:22.120 --> 20:27.198
I know we can't give him rich food
or fine clothes,

20:27.200 --> 20:31.798
but Morwenna would teach him,
and he'd have a family

20:31.800 --> 20:33.360
and comfort...

20:34.680 --> 20:36.000
..and love.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.078
Are you suggesting he
lacks that here?

20:45.080 --> 20:48.080
Oh, no, not at all.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.920
Only, 'tis surely natural for
a child to be with his mother.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.678
This man forced his way
onto my property.

20:58.680 --> 21:02.838
-No...
-Threatened me with violence...
-Wait, it isn't so. No, I never...

21:02.840 --> 21:04.478
..and attacked my servants.

21:04.480 --> 21:07.718
Lock him in the stables
and call the constables.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.718
Your Ladyship,

21:09.720 --> 21:11.040
I beg of thee...

21:26.080 --> 21:28.320
Shouldn't have done that, Ladyship.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.758
So, the deeds of partnership.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.040
When can we expect your signature?

21:42.160 --> 21:47.278
A venture based on slavery does seem
a risk in the present climate.

21:47.280 --> 21:51.558
All the more reason, then, for you
to speak in the Abolition debate.

21:51.560 --> 21:55.318
-Ah.
-Unlike some persons, I'm not so enamoured with the sound

21:55.320 --> 21:59.318
of my own voice as to be constantly
braying out opinions.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.478
And, yet - forgive me - as a highly
influential member of the House,

22:02.480 --> 22:04.958
your eloquence could be
put to good use.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.758
They'll take little persuading,
and the rewards for us

22:07.760 --> 22:09.558
will be bountiful.

22:09.560 --> 22:13.718
Your intimate knowledge of the
mahogany trade gives you a unique

22:13.720 --> 22:18.198
perspective on the necessity
for its continuance...

22:18.200 --> 22:22.000
..which it could not do
were its workforce liberated.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.800
Gentlemen, you'll excuse me.
A matter requiring my attention.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.280
-It should not take long.
-Hm.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.200
Sir...

22:51.520 --> 22:54.398
..I have the honour to ask for
the hand of your daughter Cecily

22:54.400 --> 22:56.798
in marriage.

22:56.800 --> 23:01.360
Perhaps the time has come for me
to make my maiden speech.

23:02.280 --> 23:06.798
Perhaps my recent elevation
requires me to be more...

23:06.800 --> 23:08.718
Visible?

23:08.720 --> 23:10.998
So that my views carry more...

23:11.000 --> 23:12.600
Sway.

23:14.720 --> 23:18.598
And our name, in every sense,
becomes more...

23:18.600 --> 23:19.960
Prominent.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.758
Valentine shall accompany me.

23:22.760 --> 23:27.718
He will not want to miss such
an auspicious occasion.

23:27.720 --> 23:30.878
And, lastly, may I assure you of
my undying devotion

23:30.880 --> 23:34.558
to your daughter, which I'm assured
she returns in equal measure...

23:35.880 --> 23:38.118
..and hope for your blessing upon
our engagement

23:38.120 --> 23:41.160
-and eventual nuptials.
-Get out of my house, you idiot.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.238
On the matter of my daughter's
hand...

23:50.240 --> 23:52.398
Are we in haste to settle this?

23:52.400 --> 23:57.998
I have received another offer
from one whose...undying affection

23:58.000 --> 24:00.598
is apparently matched
only by her own.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.878
In that case,
perhaps I should withdraw.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.360
Your stepson.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.440
Let us waste no further
time in naming a day.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.958
Poor boy.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.760
Leave your stepson to me.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.840
Sir George is keen to move
matters forward.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.200
Is that really a priority, Papa?

24:40.400 --> 24:42.798
Would not a long engagement
be preferable?

24:42.800 --> 24:44.118
Does one need to wait?

24:44.120 --> 24:46.998
One either means to marry,

24:47.000 --> 24:48.280
or one does not.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.600
Not.

24:56.680 --> 25:00.638
On my honour, I swear I would never
steal from a fellow cadet.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.798
I am a gentleman. An officer!

25:02.800 --> 25:04.440
You cannot expel me.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.640
Is that...?

25:45.960 --> 25:47.000
John Conan, aye.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.238
I'm taking him home to his mother.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.880
You stole him away?

25:53.040 --> 25:56.078
Drake, dear God,
what are you thinking?

25:56.080 --> 26:00.638
I'm thinking Morwenna and I may
never have a child of our own.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.878
And this one already belonged
to her.

26:02.880 --> 26:05.398
No, he do not!

26:05.400 --> 26:08.278
Morwenna left him
with Lady Whitworth.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.760
Margaret?

26:11.360 --> 26:12.880
Where is my grandson?

26:14.280 --> 26:15.838
My grandson, where is he?

26:15.840 --> 26:17.758
I haven't seen him, ma'am.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.198
Morwenna had no choice
but to let him go,

26:20.200 --> 26:22.758
but she has no rights to him that
Lady Whitworth could not

26:22.760 --> 26:23.838
contest in court.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.318
-So we'll take him without her consent.
-And live where?

26:26.320 --> 26:28.078
Not in Sawle.

26:28.080 --> 26:31.518
You'd have to leave all of us
behind, your forge, your home,

26:31.520 --> 26:34.518
and start anew somewhere she could
never find you.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.598
Jeremy!

26:35.600 --> 26:37.278
John Conan?

26:37.280 --> 26:39.478
Where are you? John Conan!

26:39.480 --> 26:40.520
Drake?

26:42.720 --> 26:44.678
You have to take him back.

26:44.680 --> 26:48.718
Now, before Lady Whitworth finds
him gone.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.480
It might even be too late.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.960
Brother, if you do not, I will.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.640
John Conan!

26:59.560 --> 27:01.558
Where are you, boy? John Conan!

27:01.560 --> 27:02.638
Ma'am?

27:02.640 --> 27:04.438
John Conan is missing.

27:04.440 --> 27:07.478
Search the attics, the stables
the cellars.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.838
Well, don't just stand there,
gaping like fools -

27:09.840 --> 27:11.118
search the orchards.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.998
John Conan!

27:13.000 --> 27:14.598
Where are you, boy?

27:14.600 --> 27:16.598
John Conan!

27:16.600 --> 27:18.278
Jo...

27:18.280 --> 27:21.038
John Conan! Where have you been?

27:21.040 --> 27:22.718
Come along.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.478
Come along.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.280
It's too cold to stand out here.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.080
I am innocent and I will
clear my name.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.958
I will assure your father.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.040
My father?

27:43.560 --> 27:45.240
Are you so naive?

27:46.600 --> 27:48.880
Do you think it's an accident
that you were expelled?

27:49.840 --> 27:51.240
What can you mean?

27:52.680 --> 27:55.758
I warned you not to ask for my hand.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.678
I was honour bound.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.158
I am a gentleman.

27:59.160 --> 28:00.640
We have no choice.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.960
We must find a way to drive a wedge
between my father and Sir George.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.398
I have evidence from Honduras.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.360
Will you use it
in your Abolition debate?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.320
Thank you. It is a great help.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.640
May God be with you.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.398
Thank you, brother.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.598
I can only afford half.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.318
Thank you, sir.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.278
-Thank you, brother.
-Keep that all.

28:41.280 --> 28:42.680
-Good luck to you.
-Thank you.

28:52.720 --> 28:56.560
I did a thing today for which
you'll despise me.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.440
I could never despise you.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.440
I stole John Conan.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.158
What?

29:12.160 --> 29:15.358
I seen how your heart do ache
for him,

29:15.360 --> 29:18.638
and I thought to ease that ache
I would steal him away.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.918
But...where is he?

29:20.920 --> 29:22.840
Demelza bid me return him.

29:23.960 --> 29:27.638
She told me I'd be caught and
punished, and thee along of I,

29:27.640 --> 29:28.958
and that I couldn't bear...

29:28.960 --> 29:30.878
You risked...

29:30.880 --> 29:32.758
..everything.

29:32.760 --> 29:35.038
I know I done a terrible thing.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.640
A monstrous thing.

29:37.960 --> 29:42.358
I-I cannot even begin to
tell you how...

29:42.360 --> 29:44.000
Please!

29:45.120 --> 29:46.720
Say nothing.

29:48.680 --> 29:54.880
I know you meant well but, please,
do not even speak to me.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.958
-Oh!
-Oh, Judas!

30:05.960 --> 30:07.480
Sorry, Sam.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.040
Sam...

30:17.040 --> 30:20.760
Mr Pascoe told me that if a note has
no watermark then it's not genuine.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.480
This have no watermark.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.958
Well, be they all like that?

30:27.960 --> 30:29.280
This one is.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.318
This ain't.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.638
Nor this.

30:33.640 --> 30:34.960
But this.

30:36.520 --> 30:39.678
So many forgeries!

30:39.680 --> 30:41.240
They're worthless?

30:42.200 --> 30:44.400
But why would a body do
such a thing?

31:05.280 --> 31:06.800
Valentine, come here!

31:12.120 --> 31:14.680
The honourable member for
St Michael.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.038
Gentlemen.

31:21.040 --> 31:24.440
Let me commend to you
the mahogany trade.

31:25.520 --> 31:28.638
Now, who amongst us does not
benefit from it?

31:28.640 --> 31:32.558
Or is ignorant of its worth to
the nation and the Crown?

31:32.560 --> 31:37.878
How could we fail to applaud the
valiant efforts of those merchants

31:37.880 --> 31:39.280
who bring it to our shores?

31:40.960 --> 31:42.358
This is a real note.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.760
This is a forgery.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.638
You can tell by the watermark - see.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.798
When you hold it up to the light,
there.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.638
So you've paid us with
useless scraps of paper, then, eh?

31:53.640 --> 31:56.438
No, all my notes are genuine - they
come direct from the Cornish Bank.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.718
And now we're meant to
feed our families on fresh air?

32:06.040 --> 32:08.758
The folks are saying if we hadn't
paid notes in the first place,

32:08.760 --> 32:11.720
-this'd never have happened.
-Oh, so now we're to blame?

32:13.440 --> 32:16.718
Such a valued trade would
not be possible

32:16.720 --> 32:18.880
if certain members have their way.

32:20.280 --> 32:24.198
The felling, processing and
transporting of this

32:24.200 --> 32:27.998
precious commodity is filthy,
backbreaking work,

32:28.000 --> 32:31.918
made possible because those
who labour in its forests

32:31.920 --> 32:37.798
are happily more robust, less
sensitive to pain than you or I.

32:37.800 --> 32:41.278
The esteemed professor,
Carl Linnaeus, asserts that your

32:41.280 --> 32:46.798
Africanus Niger is a breed apart,
eminently suitable for hard labour.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.798
His view is endorsed by the worthy
Edward Long,

32:49.800 --> 32:51.478
colonial administrator,

32:51.480 --> 32:54.838
who believes that the entire
Africanus species,

32:54.840 --> 32:59.998
characterised by "bestial
manners, stupidity and vices",

33:00.000 --> 33:04.678
has no redeeming features,
and so the most humane thing to do

33:04.680 --> 33:09.480
is control it and give it useful
activities to engage with.

33:10.840 --> 33:16.758
Let us, then, be cautious of
the sentimental view of slavery

33:16.760 --> 33:18.718
which is sometimes espoused
in this House.

33:18.720 --> 33:23.238
The fact is,
slavery is a necessity -

33:23.240 --> 33:26.718
for our economy, for the
preservation of our colonies...

33:27.960 --> 33:30.758
..and for the supremacy
of our nation in the world.

33:39.280 --> 33:43.478
The honourable member will correct
me if I'm wrong, but he appears to

33:43.480 --> 33:47.198
be saying that slaves are actually
quite fortunate, because they

33:47.200 --> 33:52.278
have food on the table, a roof over
their heads and a purpose in life.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.558
That is correct.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.558
Except when they die.

33:55.560 --> 33:59.198
Which they do, with alarming
frequency,

33:59.200 --> 34:02.678
in the most inhuman conditions -
as detailed, for example,

34:02.680 --> 34:06.918
in this recent report by
a Mr Jonas Pettigrew,

34:06.920 --> 34:10.638
assistant overseer in the mahogany
forests of Honduras,

34:10.639 --> 34:15.040
which he refers to as
a "grove of death".

34:16.000 --> 34:22.757
He details the abject suffering
of slaves, dying of malaria,

34:22.760 --> 34:27.717
deliberately deprived of medical
assistance - or even water -

34:27.719 --> 34:34.518
so that they may "die sooner and no
longer inconvenience their owner",

34:34.520 --> 34:36.760
in this case a Mr Ralph Hanson.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.639
Should this concern us?

34:42.280 --> 34:48.280
Is this not a small price to pay for
our gleaming new tables and chairs?

34:49.880 --> 34:55.757
Or should we instead endorse
other values -

34:55.760 --> 35:01.238
humanity, compassion,
care for our fellow men -

35:01.240 --> 35:07.438
and nip...nip this canker in the
bud by returning to Honduras the man

35:07.440 --> 35:11.078
who was falsely accused - doubtless
by Hanson himself, because

35:11.080 --> 35:15.800
he tried to stamp out such greed and
brutality - Colonel Edward Despard?

35:31.280 --> 35:34.198
Despard and his supporters
are proving costly.

35:34.200 --> 35:37.678
Sir, I realise you've already laid
out considerable funds.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.598
To induce your fellow planters
to denounce him,

35:40.600 --> 35:44.038
to have him recalled to London,
to persuade my fellow magistrates

35:44.040 --> 35:46.278
to incarcerate him without trial.

35:46.280 --> 35:48.598
And now we must lay out more
to be rid of him?

35:48.600 --> 35:52.280
Yes, I realise it's not ideal,
but something needs to be done.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.118
The trouble with leaving
someone to do one's dirty work -

35:56.120 --> 35:58.760
one often has to clean up
after them.

37:00.840 --> 37:05.760
You know that my visits to see you
have given me great joy.

37:06.680 --> 37:09.718
I thank you for keeping them secret.

37:09.720 --> 37:12.158
I think you have enjoyed them too.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.400
Yes.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.478
So...

37:16.480 --> 37:18.840
..what I have to tell you now
might make you sad.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.800
It makes me very sad.

37:25.320 --> 37:29.118
Your Ladyship! Your Ladyship,
I beg of thee, hear me out.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.598
'Twas mine idea alone that
John Conan should leave thee,

37:31.600 --> 37:33.758
and when I tell'd Morwenna
she was furious.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.478
She's come now to make amends,
to put an end to it

37:36.480 --> 37:37.838
once and for all.

37:37.840 --> 37:40.278
Nay, please, don't disturb her.

37:40.280 --> 37:42.358
So I come now to take my leave,

37:42.360 --> 37:45.718
and I'll cherish the time
we had together.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.920
But I have to go away now.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.800
And I am leaving you with the
kindest, most loving grandmother...

37:56.040 --> 37:59.520
..who will love you and give you
the most wonderful life.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.040
Goodbye, my beloved boy.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.600
I have news.

38:56.640 --> 39:00.598
They forgeries, Sally Chill-Off
had one in the Kiddley last night.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.278
Does she recollect who tendered it?

39:02.280 --> 39:03.318
She do.

39:03.320 --> 39:06.678
The same person as was seen
the other night with Mr Trencrom.

39:06.680 --> 39:08.160
Tess Tregidden.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.360
I said farewell to my son today.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.680
For good?

39:43.320 --> 39:45.198
Yes.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.480
I will never go back.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.760
I love him.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.080
I will always love him.

39:59.040 --> 40:03.080
I've have tried to lock away
the pain of losing him.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.040
But in doing so, I've locked away
other love.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.600
Love for my husband.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.438
Love I would give my husband,

40:19.440 --> 40:22.800
but could not give whilst I would
not grieve the loss of my child.

40:26.200 --> 40:29.198
Today I did grieve

40:29.200 --> 40:31.040
and let him go.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.760
Tonight my heart is sore.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.438
But it is free...

40:44.440 --> 40:45.880
..to love you.

41:05.840 --> 41:08.238
Mr Hanson and Mr Merceron.

41:08.240 --> 41:11.478
I take it you've rallied after
the, uh, unfortunate events.

41:11.480 --> 41:12.998
"Unfortunate"?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.798
I've been denounced.

41:14.800 --> 41:17.038
My reputation within the House...

41:17.040 --> 41:18.478
And out of it.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.518
..has been utterly ruined.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.998
Thanks to Ross, I am viewed as
a friend of heartless slave-owners,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.758
apologist for a corrupt
and brutal system.

41:26.760 --> 41:29.918
He is the hero. I am the villain.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.000
So what's the solution?

41:34.600 --> 41:36.240
Make him the villain.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.518
How, exactly?

41:43.520 --> 41:45.360
Well, what exactly would you seek?

41:47.840 --> 41:50.760
Reparation of my reputation.

41:53.280 --> 41:54.720
Revenge.

41:57.240 --> 42:00.118
On Ross, for that debacle
in the House.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.080
On Despard, for my injury
at Trenwith.

42:03.680 --> 42:04.920
And in return?

42:07.040 --> 42:09.958
I will be most generous
in my gratitude,

42:09.960 --> 42:13.440
and see no further impediment to
making our venture official.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.238
Revenge is easy,

42:17.240 --> 42:19.840
reputation more dearly bought.

42:21.480 --> 42:24.558
But I think there's a way to achieve
one by way of the other

42:24.560 --> 42:28.398
by reminding the world that Mad Ned
has a relish for settling matters

42:28.400 --> 42:29.520
with his fists.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.918
You need to put an end to this
forging business, sister.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.518
Tess will surely deny it, Sam.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.080
So what more can I do?

42:42.560 --> 42:44.520
You know fine well what you can do.

42:45.640 --> 42:46.680
No.

42:49.120 --> 42:52.280
Who was it lectured me
about leadership? Authority?

42:53.440 --> 42:55.840
'Tis maybe time to take a leaf out
your own book.

43:04.880 --> 43:06.160
Hand me that one...

43:07.440 --> 43:08.760
Friends...

43:10.600 --> 43:12.240
Friends!

43:14.000 --> 43:16.558
I regret that I must ask you to give
ear to my sister.

43:16.560 --> 43:19.398
Not as much as we regret it!

43:19.400 --> 43:21.960
What I regret is the need
to speak at all.

43:23.240 --> 43:26.998
But I can't, in all conscience,
allow this forgery business

43:27.000 --> 43:28.598
to go further.

43:28.600 --> 43:31.958
You've all been told how
to tell them apart.

43:31.960 --> 43:34.678
Hold them up to the light and
the forgery is plain,

43:34.680 --> 43:38.478
but what is not plain is why
anyone'd wish to do this

43:38.480 --> 43:39.718
in the first place.

43:39.720 --> 43:41.278
Oh, let me think.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.438
Cos 'tis one in the eye
for the rich.

43:43.440 --> 43:45.158
How?

43:45.160 --> 43:48.038
Surely it's one in the eye for
any poor soul who's paid

43:48.040 --> 43:50.838
a worthless piece of paper?

43:50.840 --> 43:54.880
Tommy Breward, Sally Chill-Off,
Mabel Bolitho.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.920
How do it feel to know that your
hard work is worth nought?

44:00.600 --> 44:03.238
This is no blow against the rich.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.998
This is punishment of your own
friends and neighbours,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.878
and whoever is behind it -

44:08.880 --> 44:12.760
to you I say enough.

44:15.960 --> 44:17.638
Do thee know who is behind it?

44:17.640 --> 44:20.318
What if we all
empty our pockets now

44:20.320 --> 44:22.360
and see who have the most forgeries?

44:24.080 --> 44:27.718
I do know, Jacka, since you ask.

44:27.720 --> 44:29.318
Name him, then.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.318
I say we've a right to be told.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.200
We should be told.

44:34.880 --> 44:38.318
I'd like to think the persons
responsible had not

44:38.320 --> 44:40.360
understood the damage they'd cause.

44:42.960 --> 44:44.680
So I'll give them another chance.

44:46.080 --> 44:51.798
Destroy all forged notes,
swear there'll be no more

44:51.800 --> 44:53.640
and let that be the end of it.

44:56.360 --> 44:59.320
But if I find another note...

45:02.640 --> 45:04.998
..I'll be forced to name
those persons,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.040
and turn them over to
the authorities.

45:08.640 --> 45:11.160
And lest there be any doubt...

45:13.400 --> 45:15.600
..forgery is a hanging offence.

45:31.600 --> 45:37.278
The first step in Mr Merceron's plan
to defame Ross and Despard,

45:37.280 --> 45:39.560
a treasonous oath of loyalty.

45:41.720 --> 45:46.478
"The bearer will endeavour to the
utmost of his power to obtain

45:46.480 --> 45:49.798
"the objects stated in this oath."

45:49.800 --> 45:53.838
Overturn the King's veto
and grant Catholic emancipation,

45:53.840 --> 45:55.158
at whatever cost.

45:55.160 --> 45:57.918
And to think, merely having such
a document in one's possession

45:57.920 --> 46:02.278
would ensure immediate
arrest on charges of treason.

46:02.280 --> 46:05.478
-And will these oaths be signed?
-Oh, yes.

46:05.480 --> 46:08.238
Like oaths are now being prepared
for signature.

46:08.240 --> 46:10.000
I think we can guess the names.

46:10.920 --> 46:14.838
So I am vindicated, yet
the Catholics remain enslaved.

46:14.840 --> 46:18.638
The King I say is mad!

46:18.640 --> 46:20.998
Ned, not so loud.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.918
Mad, call I it -
for to define true madness,

46:23.920 --> 46:26.878
what is it but to be nothing else
but mad?

46:26.880 --> 46:29.038
Please, my love, refrain.

46:29.040 --> 46:31.638
-People will think you're serious.
-I am serious!

46:31.640 --> 46:34.518
The nation is being held to
ransom by a madman,

46:34.520 --> 46:36.878
and we should stay
silent in the face of it?

46:36.880 --> 46:40.078
Get him away from here.
If his own wife cannot restrain him,

46:40.080 --> 46:43.038
I, for one, will not allow my wife
to be endangered by his ranting!

46:43.040 --> 46:45.038
-I think you overestimate...
-Do I?

46:45.040 --> 46:47.798
This is a man whose peaceful march
on Trenwith became

46:47.800 --> 46:50.758
a full-scale riot.
Weapons were used.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.838
Where did they come from?

46:52.840 --> 46:54.838
Who sent the men who brought them?

46:54.840 --> 46:57.998
Do you not see that Ned was set up,
barely escaped arrest,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.198
and now he's setting himself up
without anyone's aid,

47:00.200 --> 47:03.198
-and will take down all who stand by him?
-I will stand by him.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.358
Of course, as you have always done,
and blindly so.

47:05.360 --> 47:09.318
And I say this as one who
shares his opinions, admires him.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.918
Do you?

47:10.920 --> 47:13.078
Why do I think you resent him?

47:13.080 --> 47:15.958
As far back as James River,
I sensed a cooling...

47:15.960 --> 47:18.438
What you sensed is a lack of
adoration,

47:18.440 --> 47:21.198
a refusal to follow him blindly
into whatever reckless adventure

47:21.200 --> 47:23.358
he chose to plunge himself,
taking you with him.

47:23.360 --> 47:25.798
Do you do recollect he saved
my life?

47:25.800 --> 47:28.078
I recollect that he dragged
you from the battlefield

47:28.080 --> 47:29.998
and dumped you on a surgeon's table.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.600
The life-saving portion fell
to someone else.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.960
How tiresome are the idle rich.

47:46.920 --> 47:51.640
Shall we retire to the Oakley Arms
for some intelligent conversation?

47:53.600 --> 47:57.838
A man named Stone frequents
the Oakley Arms -

47:57.840 --> 48:02.598
a nest of known radicals, but
assumed by them to be a safe house.

48:02.600 --> 48:06.478
Merceron's agents tell him that
Despard drinks there,

48:06.480 --> 48:09.920
and in his cups is known to
be most unguarded.

48:14.040 --> 48:16.438
Now, them Frenchies,
they had the right idea!

48:16.440 --> 48:19.358
Liberte, egalite, fraternite!

48:19.360 --> 48:21.078
Madame la Guillotine!

48:21.080 --> 48:22.600
Death to the monarchy!

48:23.920 --> 48:26.238
This Stone is Joseph's man?

48:26.240 --> 48:28.518
And hitherto his task has been
to observe,

48:28.520 --> 48:30.238
whilst posing as a fellow radical.

48:30.240 --> 48:34.398
Now he will assist in planting our
signed oath about Despard's person

48:34.400 --> 48:37.038
and then inform the authorities.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.238
-Excellent.
-There is a further plan.

48:39.240 --> 48:43.560
More hazardous, but could yield
spectacular results.

48:47.640 --> 48:50.558
Joseph Merceron's men should be
visiting Ross's lodgings

48:50.560 --> 48:52.598
as we speak.

48:52.600 --> 48:57.478
Freedom of speech is the only power
we have within our fraternity.

48:57.480 --> 49:01.358
These days, I doubt that words
alone have any effect.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.198
In my case, they have none.

49:03.200 --> 49:05.160
And that, my friend, is a disgrace.

49:07.760 --> 49:10.478
I'm saddened, Horace, that Dr Enys
seems so ready to flout

49:10.480 --> 49:12.518
the Hippocratic Oath.

49:12.520 --> 49:14.118
In what particular?

49:14.120 --> 49:15.958
"First, do no harm."

49:15.960 --> 49:17.238
How is that pertinent?

49:17.240 --> 49:18.518
It is pertinent to Ross.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.598
At a time when his dearest
friend should be his most loyal.

49:21.600 --> 49:24.358
-You think I was wrong to challenge him?
-Not at all.

49:24.360 --> 49:25.918
But you were wrong to step away.

49:25.920 --> 49:29.400
What possible use could you be in
a carriage with your wife and a pug?

49:33.920 --> 49:36.878
Number 6 George Street,
just off the Strand.

49:36.880 --> 49:40.958
Were I so used, I'd want vengeance!

49:40.960 --> 49:42.678
Justice is all I seek.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.078
Yeah, but how's it to be got?

49:44.080 --> 49:45.358
Look at France.

49:45.360 --> 49:48.478
Only when commons rise up
do the rich take heed.

49:48.480 --> 49:52.118
True. Can anything be done
by peaceful means?

49:52.120 --> 49:54.720
Perhaps someone should
remove the King.

49:55.960 --> 49:57.118
Perhaps they should.

49:57.120 --> 49:58.360
Ned...

50:02.560 --> 50:03.840
Come away.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.320
Should we not challenge them?

50:10.440 --> 50:12.680
Not if I'm correct in my surmise.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.558
Do I hear you're an expert
with explosives?

50:15.560 --> 50:16.998
-Ned...
-Yes.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.280
How about exploding His Majesty?

50:23.120 --> 50:25.318
Well, that would certainly
solve the problem!

50:25.320 --> 50:26.558
Ned, enough.

50:26.560 --> 50:28.678
This is ridiculous talk.
If it were reported...

50:28.680 --> 50:30.318
By whom?

50:30.320 --> 50:31.840
This is a safe house.

50:32.880 --> 50:35.838
These men are comrades and friends.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.078
-We surely are!
-Can you doubt it?

50:38.080 --> 50:39.958
Wise to doubt most people
these days.

50:39.960 --> 50:42.078
Particularly those who encourage
seditious talk.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.320
Shall we go?

50:44.960 --> 50:46.798
-Suit yourself.
-Ned...

50:46.800 --> 50:48.118
Kitty, can you help me, please?

50:48.120 --> 50:50.438
-Kitty, you stay where you are.
-Ned, it's time to leave.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.918
-We're going.
-Get off!

50:52.920 --> 50:54.680
Ah...

50:56.400 --> 50:58.398
Apologies, my friend.

50:58.400 --> 51:01.680
You should know by now -
I leave when I'm ready.

51:23.480 --> 51:24.678
Good day to you, Mary.

51:24.680 --> 51:25.878
Shall I take you home?

51:25.880 --> 51:27.878
No, thank you. I must stay.

51:27.880 --> 51:31.240
Please go. There's nothing you can
do until he's sober again.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.838
He'll be fine.

51:36.840 --> 51:39.238
He's a Cornish miner -
he'll survive.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.718
What do you think they were
looking for?

52:03.720 --> 52:05.240
Nothing seems disturbed.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.358
Unless the man was not looking...

52:08.360 --> 52:10.078
..but leaving something.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.118
But why?

52:11.120 --> 52:12.360
What would it be?

52:27.560 --> 52:28.960
Search the whole building.

52:39.720 --> 52:40.760
What is it?

52:42.760 --> 52:46.398
An oath of allegiance for
the liberation of Irish Catholics.

52:47.840 --> 52:49.040
Open up!

52:57.000 --> 52:58.398
Stay where you are!

52:58.400 --> 53:01.238
Anyone found with an oath
about their person will be arrested!

53:01.240 --> 53:03.278
One and all, follow me!

53:03.280 --> 53:06.238
Where's your warrant?
Show me your warrant.

53:06.240 --> 53:08.758
-Take your...
-Let go of my wife!

53:08.760 --> 53:10.200
Come here, you!

53:12.520 --> 53:14.438
Search him!

53:14.440 --> 53:16.998
Search all you like -
you'll find nothing on me.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
He has nothing.
My husband is innocent.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.398
Nothing. There's nothing.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.798
I told you there was nothing.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.518
My husband is not a traitor.

53:25.520 --> 53:26.878
He's a servant of the Crown!

53:26.880 --> 53:28.800
-Madam, please...
-Take your hands off me!

53:44.960 --> 53:47.278
Check all drawers and cupboards.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.880
Check under there.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.238
-Shh, shh...
-What's going on?
-Make yourself scarce.

53:52.240 --> 53:54.760
-Nothing?
-There's nothing here.
-Double check.

53:57.160 --> 53:59.478
I trust your men will remake
that bed once they've

53:59.480 --> 54:00.918
finished dismantling it?

54:00.920 --> 54:03.960
Captain Poldark is most
fastidious about his linens.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.440
Are you done?

54:08.840 --> 54:10.078
It would appear so, ma'am.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.918
Then be so good as to read
this document.

54:11.920 --> 54:14.638
It affirms that you and your men
conducted a thorough search of

54:14.640 --> 54:17.520
these chambers in the presence
of witnesses, and found nothing.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.040
Correct?

54:22.520 --> 54:23.798
I suppose.

54:23.800 --> 54:24.880
Kindly sign.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.040
Right.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.400
You were magnificent.

54:46.480 --> 54:47.518
Yes.

54:47.520 --> 54:48.560
I was.

55:14.840 --> 55:16.160
The day is named.

55:18.080 --> 55:21.078
I've considered our situation
and believe there's now

55:21.080 --> 55:22.440
only one solution.

55:32.440 --> 55:33.518
Success?

55:33.520 --> 55:34.718
Mixed.

55:34.720 --> 55:35.998
Poldark eluded us.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.398
Someone must have tipped him off.

55:37.400 --> 55:40.118
Damn, blast and set fire to him!

55:40.120 --> 55:41.478
And Despard?

55:41.480 --> 55:44.160
They failed to plant the oath
but he was arrested anyway.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.118
So what will happen now?

55:47.120 --> 55:49.400
Well, that we are working on.

55:50.480 --> 55:53.558
The fault was all mine.
I was blinkered.

55:53.560 --> 55:58.718
But that man is one of the bravest,
most principled I've ever met...

55:58.720 --> 56:01.198
-And I.
-But his recklessness, his stubbornness

56:01.200 --> 56:03.678
-will be his undoing...
-And could be yours.

56:03.680 --> 56:05.998
And that I cannot stand and watch.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.640
We must get him away from here.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.798
With or without the sanction
of the Crown.

56:10.800 --> 56:13.198
The first vessel for Jamaica.

56:13.200 --> 56:14.958
I'll see to it tomorrow.

56:14.960 --> 56:16.998
Kitty will be relieved.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.678
They're very late.

56:18.680 --> 56:21.280
I hope she's not had trouble
persuading him home.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.158
Kitty...

56:26.800 --> 56:31.800
# I'd hold a finger to my tongue

56:33.000 --> 56:38.680
# I'd hold a finger waiting... #

56:40.680 --> 56:42.240
I wish Papa were here.

56:44.760 --> 56:46.200
So do I, my love.

56:48.600 --> 56:51.480
But Papa must see to important
matters in London.

57:05.280 --> 57:06.520
You can't go in.

57:13.480 --> 57:16.600
Well, Ross, here we are again.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.240
Back where it started.

57:27.840 --> 57:31.198
Only this time the charge is
seriously impressive.

57:31.200 --> 57:32.518
What is it?

57:32.520 --> 57:33.680
High treason.

57:35.360 --> 57:37.878
I warned you what would happen
if you failed to keep him

57:37.880 --> 57:42.480
out of trouble. Now if he falls,
he takes you with him.

57:52.560 --> 57:54.278
Someone's stealing our ore.

57:54.280 --> 57:56.478
Must it not be someone with
a knowledge of the mine?

57:56.480 --> 57:57.518
One of our own.

57:57.520 --> 57:58.998
The Crown should honour him,

57:59.000 --> 58:01.758
instead of attempting to cover
up its mistreatment of him

58:01.760 --> 58:03.798
by inventing crimes he did
not commit.

58:03.800 --> 58:06.958
You will thank me for providing
you with a mate that

58:06.960 --> 58:08.958
matches your station.

58:08.960 --> 58:10.718
I'll get you out of here, Colonel.

58:10.720 --> 58:12.718
Break him from the jail?
You're insane.

58:12.720 --> 58:14.360
Shall we?
