- It's gonna be great!
- I'm gonna get so fat.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.323
Mostly great.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.362
Oh, gross.
They're at it again.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.408
If you don't like it,
don't look.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.165
She looks great, doesn't she?
Yeah.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.641
Not really gaining weight the
way I would've expected.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.883
I finally understand why people
say pregnant women glow.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.928
Phil, I've had three children.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.287
Hey, Dad, Gloria,
open our present.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.210
Uy! I hope
it's something fancy.

19:35.280 --> 19:38.807
[ Gasps ] it's for the baby.
I love it!

19:38.880 --> 19:42.123
We got it at a shop at
Heathrow, duty-free.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.163
[ Chuckles ] Not for long.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.129
[ English Accent]
isn't it absolutely brilliant?

19:46.200 --> 19:48.560
Okay, we were in London two weeks.
Lose the accent, Madonna.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.490
Why is your face all scratched up?
[Scoffs ] Stupid Larry.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.046
This feels so weird.
It suits you.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.964
Don't even joke about it.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.407
That's it. He is moving out
of the house tomorrow.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.251
Really? Mm-hmm. Oh, and
that beard is going.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.051
Fine. But it's gonna
kill Shorty.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.930
[Clapping 1 Okay, everybody,
let's gather together.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.321
Manny is gonna read us
a little something...

20:10.400 --> 20:12.641
that he prepare
in his poetry camp.

20:12.720 --> 20:16.281
Thank you, Mom. This is for my
new baby brother or sister.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.209
“Welcome, little one.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.243
Open your eyes
and take your place.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.049
This is where
you're meant to be,

20:23.120 --> 20:24.884
nestled in the bosom
of your mother.”

20:25.000 --> 20:26.525
Lucky baby.
What?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.489
Love you, baby.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.042
“This is where you're meant to
be, in the arms of your father.

20:32.120 --> 20:35.408
His long, long journey
has readied him for this day.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.245
Though his skin may be loose,
his hair but a wisp...

20:38.320 --> 20:40.243
and his eyes milky with age”-

20:40.320 --> 20:42.607
All right. We're done here.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.848
Get a drink.
[ Clears Throat]

20:47.920 --> 20:50.400
Don't feel bad about making
me move out, Mrs. D.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.084
I knew this day would
come eventually,

20:52.160 --> 20:53.650
and I'm totally covered.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.210
Great.
So we'll see you around.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.009
I got a place with
an old friend of mine.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.607
Well, not so much of a place
as a storage pod.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.251
Not so much of
a friend as a raccoon.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.084
Good to know
you'll have company.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.806
I call him Bubbles because
his mouth is all foamy.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.850
Dylan, I am onto your little game.
I know none of this is true.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.843
You're just trying to guilt me
into letting you stay.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.571
You're right. I'm sorry.
Mm-hmm.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.290
I'll just live in my car.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.964
Think I can borrow
a coat hanger...

21:19.040 --> 21:21.202
in case I get
locked in there again?

21:21.320 --> 21:23.288
[ Sighs ] God. What's going on?

21:23.360 --> 21:25.886
No, no, no. No, no. All of it.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.122
Sure you don't want to dance
with the devil before I get rid-

21:28.200 --> 21:29.486
Go.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.045
Fine.
