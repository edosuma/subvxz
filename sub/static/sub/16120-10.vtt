00:00.830 --> 00:03.993
( upbeat pop music plays )

00:23.690 --> 00:24.839

00:24.890 --> 00:25.948

00:32.460 --> 00:33.757
Hey.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.593
You clone started
rumors now.

00:37.630 --> 00:39.097
What?

00:39.140 --> 00:40.835
Micah West taking time
out of his busy day

00:40.870 --> 00:43.338
to watch me do what I do?

00:43.370 --> 00:45.201
Yeah, they gonna
be talking.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.707
Is that a problem?

00:46.740 --> 00:48.503
You tell me.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.542
That's not a problem
for me.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.818
Plus,
I'm not that busy
anymore, so...

00:54.850 --> 00:58.308
Well, you should
work on that.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.454
Get yourself
in somebody's school,

01:00.490 --> 01:03.789
because I see your
SAT scores dropping
by the day.

01:03.830 --> 01:06.549
I start Gardini Prep
next week.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.556
Yeah, well, let me know
how that goes.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.694
If you ain't clapping
for somebody else.

01:17.770 --> 01:20.238
I'm going to let you go.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.373
I guess I'll see you soon?

01:22.410 --> 01:24.446
Why guess
when you can know?

01:24.480 --> 01:26.846
Micah, you are long overdue
for some company.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.711
Yeah.

01:28.750 --> 01:31.184
I'm going to stop by
Miss Violet's house
after school.

01:31.220 --> 01:32.858
- Cool.
- But this ain't going to be

01:32.890 --> 01:34.551
no "Netflix and chill"
kind of situation.

01:34.590 --> 01:37.559
No, no, no, no,
of course not.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.296
( both laugh )

01:43.230 --> 01:44.822
( clears throat )

01:46.370 --> 01:49.703
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.401
( sizzling )

01:51.440 --> 01:53.829
( blues music plays
over radio )

01:53.880 --> 01:55.677
( chuckles )

01:55.710 --> 01:56.904
This is going to be good.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.214
Better than this morning?

01:59.250 --> 02:01.571
( both laugh )

02:02.720 --> 02:04.244
So, my queen,

02:04.290 --> 02:06.781
where shall we dine?

02:06.820 --> 02:08.458
In the bed
or at the table?

02:08.490 --> 02:10.583
Table's fine.
Just needs setting,
though.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.722
All right.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.262
"NOLA NOW:
A Televised Discussion

02:19.300 --> 02:21.234
"on Police Violence
in the Ninth Ward.

02:21.270 --> 02:23.363
"With Melissa Harris-Perry

02:23.410 --> 02:25.799
"and celebrated
NOLA journalist

02:27.880 --> 02:29.745
( laughs )

02:29.780 --> 02:31.645
Well, excuse me,

02:31.680 --> 02:34.945
celebrated
NOLA journalist
Nova Bordelon.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.517
Why aren't we
celebrating this?

02:37.550 --> 02:41.259
Finally,
somebody who deserves
the props is getting it.

02:41.290 --> 02:42.621
It's just a Q&A.

02:42.660 --> 02:43.922
No, no, no, no.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.621
- You're not doing that.
- Doing what?

02:45.660 --> 02:48.652
You're not going to deny
the praise that I'm giving you.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.895
Listen, obviously
the articles you're doing

02:50.930 --> 02:53.660
on Too Sweet and the migrant
workers, they're working.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.258
They're turning
the right heads.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.665
Melissa Harris-Perry?

02:56.710 --> 02:58.701
Well, I'm honored
to be her guest.

02:58.740 --> 03:00.935
Here, taste this.

03:00.980 --> 03:03.540
Get in there.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.672
Mm.

03:04.710 --> 03:07.417
That's so delicious.
Oh, my God.

03:07.450 --> 03:09.589
And, finally,

03:09.620 --> 03:11.838
this will give us
a platform.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.478
You cannot deny

03:14.520 --> 03:16.522
when you put
pen to paper,

03:16.560 --> 03:19.597
our BLM actions,
they have more traction.

03:19.630 --> 03:21.825
Well, it's been a while
since we've had a dialogue

03:21.860 --> 03:24.658
of talking to somebody
from the community instead
of just at the community.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.567
Well, MHP and you,

03:27.600 --> 03:29.306
that's worth
a front-row seat to see.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.535
You know, anybody
who's anybody in NOLA,

03:31.570 --> 03:33.834
they're going
to be watching this.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.768
So, you have your
talking points together?

03:38.010 --> 03:40.319
Still haven't
worked that out.

03:40.350 --> 03:43.717
But I imagine she's going
to start by asking me
about my two articles.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.843
No, no, no, no.
You got to be prepared.

03:45.890 --> 03:49.621
Look, don't worry.
I'll help you, all right?

03:49.660 --> 03:51.855
This is an incredible
opportunity.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.321
I think we should
eat this

03:57.370 --> 03:59.429
while it's still hot.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.778
( phone beeps )

04:11.810 --> 04:14.540
( phone line ringing )

04:17.390 --> 04:18.641
( phone beeps off)

04:21.090 --> 04:24.355
( phone chiming )

04:24.390 --> 04:25.459
Ralph Angel?

04:25.490 --> 04:27.651
Ralph over phone:
Hey, Charley. You almost here?

04:27.700 --> 04:29.759
I'm on my way.
What's up?

04:29.800 --> 04:32.894
We got a problem.
We need to put our
heads into it.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.433
Blue!

04:36.470 --> 04:38.768
Come on, you're going
to be late!

04:38.810 --> 04:42.473
Darla:
Oh, my God, is this
how he is every morning?

04:42.510 --> 04:44.307
He's just excited because
you're picking him up.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.669
( laughs )

04:45.710 --> 04:48.440
- Blue: Mommy, come back!
- Darla: Okay.

04:48.480 --> 04:51.745
Well, if you ask me,
if they ain't shown by now,
they ain't gonna.

04:53.690 --> 04:55.510
We had two workers
murdered on our land.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.778
I wouldn't
come back neither.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.458
The storm already threw off
the harvest schedule.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.889
We got to get someone
in here quick.

05:02.930 --> 05:05.023
This ain't no
one-man job, y'all.

05:07.770 --> 05:08.964
Okay...

05:09.000 --> 05:10.331
Blue!

05:10.370 --> 05:11.928
Come on, get ready!

05:14.040 --> 05:15.507
Morning, y'all.

05:17.910 --> 05:20.049
What's wrong?

05:20.080 --> 05:22.685
Y'all looking like somebody
stole your Halloween candy.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.711
- We ain't got no workers.
- But we will.

05:24.750 --> 05:27.116
I'll round up
some new men somehow.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.720
But you get back
to that mill deal.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.888
Don't make sense
to harvest cane_|f
you can't ngnd It.

05:32.930 --> 05:34.693
I know, I know, I know.

05:36.430 --> 05:38.921
Been missing
that face, Prosper.

05:40.470 --> 05:41.960
I don't know why
you say that now.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.002
You're the one quit
the High Yellow.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.598
Now it's closed down.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.709
- Closed?
- Yeah.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.037
What you talking about?

05:48.080 --> 05:50.640
Blue it's almost time
to leave for school.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.649
Darla, you done
wasted your gas.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.875
He rides with me.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.956
Um, Ralph Angel told me
to pick him up at 7:00.

06:00.990 --> 06:05.086
I'm taking him on Mondays
and Wednesdays now.

06:05.130 --> 06:07.724
Aunt Vi, this is all on me.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.060
I forgot to tell you
that Darla was taking
Blue to school today.

06:12.100 --> 06:14.933
Hi, Aunt Vi!

06:14.970 --> 06:16.562
Violet:
Hey,you!

06:16.610 --> 06:17.963
( Violet laughs )

06:18.010 --> 06:19.875
Oh, you looking good.

06:19.910 --> 06:21.673
Boy, come on,
you're gonna be late.

06:23.510 --> 06:25.068
- Yup.
- All right.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.158
( music plays )

06:39.190 --> 06:40.794
* Dreams never die

06:40.830 --> 06:43.025
* Take flight
as the world turns *

06:43.070 --> 06:44.594

06:44.630 --> 06:46.894

06:46.940 --> 06:48.669
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

06:48.700 --> 06:51.032
* Take flight

06:51.070 --> 06:53.038
* Dreams never die

06:58.610 --> 07:01.909
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

07:01.950 --> 07:05.181
* Keep the colors in the lines,
take flight *

07:16.830 --> 07:18.695
Hollywood:
Hey, now.

07:25.740 --> 07:26.604
What's that?

07:26.640 --> 07:27.607
I know you're doing
some replanting.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.006
I figured I'd bring you
some African violets.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.178
Well, you can take those
right on back to Africa.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.710
Come on, Vi.

07:34.750 --> 07:37.810
No, I'm doing
something new.

07:37.850 --> 07:40.853
Moving on from the same old,
same old.

07:40.890 --> 07:43.085
Look, baby, I ain't
asking you to forget

07:43.130 --> 07:45.052
about what happened
between us.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.650
But you know I had
a good reason for doing
what I had to do.

07:47.700 --> 07:48.951
You know that.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.867
So why can't you
just let things go?

07:51.900 --> 07:54.039
Baby, we wasting our days.

07:54.070 --> 07:56.129
I'd rather be
spending mine with you.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.146
* It's gonna take
a bit of work *

08:06.880 --> 08:09.610

08:52.630 --> 08:55.326
You got to sign

08:55.360 --> 08:57.021
Oh, man,

Thank you.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.211
Blue's a luclq young man,

09:16.920 --> 09:20.014
Just trying to do
what my dad did for me.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.914
That's all.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.325
Come on, man.

09:24.390 --> 09:25.652
Bye, Miss Velez.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.793
Reyna :
Bye!

09:26.830 --> 09:28.991
- Bye, Miss Velez.
- See you.

09:29.030 --> 09:30.566
Okay, you got
all that information?

09:30.600 --> 09:32.795
- Our talking points
have to be tight.
- Woman: Okay, I got it.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.195
Chantal?

09:35.240 --> 09:38.061
Zina's water heater broke
and flooded her living room.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.805
Sorry, I thought we were
going to be done by now.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.671
What's going on?

09:43.210 --> 09:47.010
Well, folks are starting
to fall back to sleep.

09:47.050 --> 09:49.245
You planning on doing
something at my interview?

09:49.280 --> 09:51.248
No, just working
on your talking points.

09:51.290 --> 09:54.350
Thanks, but I got this.
I don't need you
to do that.

09:54.390 --> 09:57.689
Nova, this is a great stage,
and I'm just trying to help.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.824
And we got to get the word
out about police violence
in the Ninth.

10:00.860 --> 10:03.021
Look, I know you mean well,

10:03.070 --> 10:05.925
but this is a big
platform for me.

10:05.970 --> 10:07.835
I don't want anybody
putting words in my mouth.

10:07.870 --> 10:09.735
I don't want
the conversation to end

10:09.770 --> 10:11.738
before it even starts.

10:11.770 --> 10:15.376
Nova, the work we're
doing is about more
than any one person.

10:15.410 --> 10:18.106
Now is the time
to get folks woke.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.947
By any means necessary.

10:19.980 --> 10:21.914
Yeah. I agree.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.645
But I mean to do that
my way.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.019
Not yours.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.257
( sighs )

10:29.290 --> 10:31.155
All right, y'all,
let's call it for the day.

10:31.190 --> 10:33.294
Okay?
Go ahead and pack it up.

10:34.930 --> 10:38.764
We'll be bringing in roughly
300 acres this harvest.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.798
Yes, my father
was Ernest Bordelon.

10:45.370 --> 10:46.928
Thank you.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.379
I appreciate that.

10:48.410 --> 10:50.878
Yeah, yeah, tomorrow
at 3:00 sounds good.

10:50.910 --> 10:52.138
Okay. Uh-huh.

10:52.180 --> 10:53.647
( phone beeps off)

10:57.420 --> 10:59.081
Woman over phone:
Good afternoon, Mrs. West,

10:59.120 --> 11:01.714
Jill Whitaker

11:01.760 --> 11:04.957
This is regarding Micah
and his application
for admission.

11:04.990 --> 11:07.026
We would like
to schedule a meeting

11:07.060 --> 11:08.425
with you and your husband

11:08.460 --> 11:10.724
to discuss an incident
that's been brought

11:10.770 --> 11:13.295
_to our attention
by Micah's preVIous school.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.433
I just reached out
to Mr. Davis...

11:15.470 --> 11:16.732
(call ends)

11:16.770 --> 11:18.169
That don't sound good.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.428
- Hey!
- Hey, baby.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.308
I thought I'd handled it
when we were back home.

11:26.350 --> 11:29.717
Why do they have
to contact Davis?

11:29.750 --> 11:31.149
Because he's the boy's
daddy, Charley.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.181
Well, Micah's down here
with me now,

11:33.220 --> 11:35.313
while Davis is doing
whatever he's doing.

11:35.360 --> 11:38.784
Honey, you know Davis
ain't my favorite person,

11:38.830 --> 11:42.766
but he still has a right
to be in his son's life.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.869
Hey, you.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.390
( laughs )

11:51.770 --> 11:53.237
Nova:
I can help you get everybody
back to Zina's place.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.508
Uh, no, we got it.

11:54.540 --> 11:57.941
_ - I don't want to
Inconvenience you.
- You're not.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.039
- Nova: Hey, Rid.
- What's up, Nova?

12:00.080 --> 12:01.843
- You got company?
- No, no, it's okay.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.848
Look, I ain't going
to keep you,

12:03.890 --> 12:06.211
but you heard about Too Sweet
and his family getting evicted?

12:06.250 --> 12:08.514
Well, they got him
a spot at the shelter.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.482
But they say when Too Sweet
went up in there,

12:10.530 --> 12:12.919
wardy flipped the hell out.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.394
He-- He said
it's too much like jail.

12:15.430 --> 12:18.399
- That man mind still
locked up, you hear me?
- Shit. Where he at?

12:18.430 --> 12:20.330
I don't know.
Nobody don't know.

12:20.370 --> 12:22.133
I mean, I'm just trying
to spread the word.

12:22.170 --> 12:24.502
But everybody need to keep their
eyes open for real, though.

12:24.540 --> 12:27.031
Yeah. I got it.
Good looking out, Rid.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.172
Rid:
No problem.

12:35.150 --> 12:36.469
Good morning.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.886
Overslept a little bit.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.480
I'm going to be a little late
to Gardini Prep.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.249
I know it's just
the new student thing,

12:43.290 --> 12:45.850
but I am pretty excited.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.394
We're not going
to be late.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.489
Why aren't you dressed?

12:50.530 --> 12:53.294
I have an appointment
at a mill.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.366
And I got a call
from Gardini.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.061
They want to discuss
the incident

12:58.110 --> 12:59.839
at your previous school.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.375
I thought you said that picture
wouldn't follow me.

13:09.420 --> 13:10.887
And it shouldn't have,

13:10.920 --> 13:13.081
but private schools talk.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.985
Don't worry,
I have reached out
to our lawyer--

13:15.020 --> 13:17.955
Why does everybody want
to believe the worst about me?

13:17.990 --> 13:19.389
You know why.

13:19.430 --> 13:21.853
Not everything
is because I'm black.

13:21.900 --> 13:26.428
No, but you're black and
you're the son of a superstar.

13:26.470 --> 13:28.165
And that was great
when Davis was seen

13:28.200 --> 13:29.599
as one of the good ones.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.108
But between your father,
and that picture,

13:32.140 --> 13:36.873
and the paparazzi showing up,
everything changed.

13:36.910 --> 13:39.003
Baby, Gardini's just scared

13:39.050 --> 13:40.415
we'll bring a circus
to their campus.

13:40.450 --> 13:42.611
But I'll work it out.
Promise.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.618
I'll just go
to public school then.

13:44.650 --> 13:46.618
You're not giving up
that easily, Micah.

13:46.650 --> 13:49.414
We worked hard for you to have
certain choices in life.

13:49.460 --> 13:52.520
Well, now, St. Jo High
is a very good choice.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.027
I mean, it's a blue ribbon
schooL

13:54.060 --> 13:56.051
Look at Nova.
She went to Tulane.

13:56.100 --> 13:59.263
I know, but we have
slightly different
expectations of Micah.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.861
Violet:
You mean you want him to be
one of them privileged kids.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.868
It's not a dirty word,
Aunt Vi.

14:05.910 --> 14:08.299
White folks pass down
privilege to their kids
every day.

14:08.340 --> 14:11.639
The same system that
pushes some folks down
lifts others up.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.910
Aren't I supposed
to help my son?

14:13.950 --> 14:15.178
Of_ course:
I was just saying--

14:15.220 --> 14:17.108
Well, staying in the private
school system here

14:17.150 --> 14:18.947
will only help us
when we get back to LA.

14:18.990 --> 14:21.481
and reapply
for schools there.
It will look like

14:21.520 --> 14:23.283
we came down here
for personal reasons

14:23.330 --> 14:24.649
_and he's still
In the system,

14:24.690 --> 14:26.351
not like he got
kicked out of it.

14:26.390 --> 14:28.449
But I was kicked out
of the system.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.364
I promise you.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.197
Violet:
I don't understand

14:33.240 --> 14:35.663
why you want to spend
$10,000 to go to a school

14:35.700 --> 14:37.167
that don't want you there.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.974
Try $36,000.

14:40.010 --> 14:41.534
Thirty-six thousand dollars?

14:41.580 --> 14:44.504
That's how you spend
your money?

14:44.550 --> 14:47.212
Folks don't make
that in a year.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.047
Lord knows I don't.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.617
And that's why we send Micah
to private school.

14:51.650 --> 14:53.379
We don't want him
to be like...

14:55.120 --> 14:58.021
Aunt Vi,
I didn't mean it like that.

15:02.030 --> 15:03.497
Don't bother, baby.
I understand.

15:03.530 --> 15:05.623
You got perfectly good money
to throw away.

15:05.670 --> 15:07.331
None of my business.

15:21.350 --> 15:23.215
- Jacob: Have a seat.
- Charley: Thank you.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.413
The basic deal--
the farmer and the mill

15:26.450 --> 15:27.678
split what we get
from the refinery.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.029
We're the middleman
in all this,

15:30.060 --> 15:33.427
but we don't grind
if the refinery's
not paying us.

15:33.460 --> 15:34.688
And what's your cut?

15:34.730 --> 15:39.064
40/60 split, in favor
of the farmer.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.466
Forty percent
is pretty steep.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.628
I mean, I'm a sports manager,
and we only take five percent.

15:44.670 --> 15:47.605
I know all about you.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.310
You're quite the celebrity
around here,

15:55.350 --> 15:57.318
you and your husband.

15:57.350 --> 15:59.181
I've been a fan.

15:59.220 --> 16:02.383
Forty percent is high,
was my point.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.150
Any mill in any parish
going to give you the same deal.

16:05.190 --> 16:07.158
Just grow good cane.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.395
You'll see plenty of profit
from that 60 percent.

16:09.430 --> 16:10.692
Yeah, that's good.

16:10.730 --> 16:13.631
I mean, all this is just
to sell the land.

16:13.670 --> 16:15.194
We're just trying
to prove it's good land

16:15.240 --> 16:17.333
by bringing in
a good harvest or two.

16:17.370 --> 16:20.703
Well, it sounds like
you got it all figured out.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.471
Charley:
This place is amazing.

16:24.510 --> 16:25.670
Sure is.

16:25.710 --> 16:27.712
Me and my family,
we live and breathe sugar.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.513
Always have,
always will.

16:29.550 --> 16:32.610
So, this is what it takes
to get a 5-pound bag
of sweetness

16:32.650 --> 16:34.481
on the grocery store
shelf, huh?

16:34.520 --> 16:36.112
Most folks think
sugar comes

16:36.160 --> 16:37.582
from the sugar fairy
or something.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.155
( both laugh )

16:40.200 --> 16:43.226
Charley:
How old is this mill?

16:43.270 --> 16:44.623
Jacob:
Well, let's just say,

16:44.670 --> 16:46.228
at least from
the look of things,

16:46.270 --> 16:48.067
longer than you and me
been on God's green Earth.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.692
Charley:
Well, thank you.

16:49.740 --> 16:52.561
Which is a good thing,
because we'll all be pulling
some hefty hours

16:52.610 --> 16:54.100
come grinding season.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.370
You'll be on the phone
with me and my brother Paul

16:56.410 --> 16:57.809
more than you talk
to your mama.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.341
That won't be hard.

17:00.380 --> 17:02.439
I'll ask about that
when I know you better.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.783
So, why so many calls?

17:06.820 --> 17:08.617
Well, we don't want you
cutting your cane

17:08.660 --> 17:10.252
unless we can grind it
right away.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.726
Every hour that cane sits,
you lose more sugar.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.250
And the purer the sugar,

17:15.300 --> 17:16.756
the bigger you bump
you get from the refinery.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.724
- Bump?
- Clean, pure sugar.

17:19.770 --> 17:22.295
The refineries
give the farmer
a direct bonus.

17:22.340 --> 17:23.807
Not to us, to you.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.501
And how much would that be?

17:25.540 --> 17:28.634
You say you got 300 acres
this year, 800 when
up and going?

17:28.680 --> 17:30.272
- Yeah.
- If it's a good harvest,

17:30.310 --> 17:34.314
you're looking at around
$400,000 bonus this year alone.

17:35.650 --> 17:37.140
You ready to go in
and talk business?

17:37.190 --> 17:38.748
- Lead the way.
- Come on.

17:47.260 --> 17:49.319
( voices speaking
indistinctly )

17:53.470 --> 17:55.165
What's going on here,
Clive?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.838
It's bad, Vi.
Real bad.

17:56.870 --> 17:58.565
Why are you whispering?

17:58.610 --> 18:01.773
Health inspector's here.
He's asking all these questions.

18:01.810 --> 18:03.573
When the smoke detector
batteries got replaced?

18:03.610 --> 18:05.578
When new hoses
and filters come In?

18:05.610 --> 18:07.214
Don't nobody
know all that.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.569
Oh, so you
calling me a nobody.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.212
Because I know all that.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.810
The hoses and filters
were replaced In January.

18:12.850 --> 18:14.852
You sure? _
Can't get caught lying.

18:14.890 --> 18:17.586
Lying? I do it
every three months.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.586
On the 15th,
to be exact.

18:19.630 --> 18:20.858
What else do they
want to know?

18:20.900 --> 18:23.368
When we replaced the exhaust
fans over the stoves?

18:23.400 --> 18:25.561
Last July. They good
for another two years.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.296
Where the paperwork?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.729
I don't work here anymore,
or have you forgotten that?

18:30.770 --> 18:32.328
Come on, Vi.

18:32.370 --> 18:34.429
I looked through
the filing cabinets.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.232
Why won't you help me?

18:36.280 --> 18:38.840
You can have
your old job back.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.768
I don't want
my old job back.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.243
Been there.
Done all that.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.752
Hire me as manager.

18:47.790 --> 18:51.157
A manager with a salary,
benefits and year-end--

18:51.190 --> 18:53.249
- I don't--
- Year-end bonus.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.256
I don't give
my own kin benefits.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.928
Well, that's between you
and the Lord on Judgment Day.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.393
Have a good day, Clive.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.465
Okay, deal.

19:04.970 --> 19:06.858
How are you today,
Mister...?

19:06.910 --> 19:09.378
Lafayette.
I'm good, ma'am.

19:09.410 --> 19:11.844
So I am the new manager,
Violet Bordelon.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.576
And I've got that paperwork
you've asked for

19:14.620 --> 19:15.769
back in my office.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.287
I can get it for you.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.184
Okay.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.757
Now, I can tell
you from around here,

19:20.790 --> 19:23.281
so you know that after
a Louisiana storm,

19:23.330 --> 19:25.457
anything that don't swim
comes right on in.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.651
So, we might find
some guests back there,

19:27.700 --> 19:28.849
but not normally.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.595
Not under my watch.

19:35.570 --> 19:36.594
Afternoon.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.274
Is Blue ready?

19:40.310 --> 19:42.574
Actually, I sent him
outside for a bit.

19:42.610 --> 19:44.305
Is everything all right?

19:44.350 --> 19:46.705
He's real excited
about that 200 trip.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.877
Ralph Angel,

19:48.920 --> 19:51.718
the front office wants
your aunt, Violet Bordelon,

19:51.750 --> 19:54.548
to sign Blue's permission slip
for the field trip.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.355
- But I'm his daddy--
- I know. I know.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.721
But she's listed
as his legal guardian,

20:02.760 --> 20:05.263
and the school's saying
that they can't accept
the liability.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.892
Liability?

20:08.670 --> 20:10.831
If I say it's okay
then it's okay for him
to go.

20:10.870 --> 20:14.203
I agree, but we don't
make the rules here.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.307
I'm so sorry.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.875
No, it's...
it's no problem.

20:19.910 --> 20:21.343
All right?

20:21.380 --> 20:24.918
I'm going to work it out,
all right?

20:30.730 --> 20:31.822
( knocks )

20:31.860 --> 20:32.986
Which one?

20:33.030 --> 20:36.329
This one, or this one?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.964
Well, I think the one
you have on

20:38.000 --> 20:39.820
really shows off your legs.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.963
Mm-hmm.
What's the occasion?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.605
Well, you are looking at
the new manager

20:44.640 --> 20:46.665
of the High Yellow.

20:46.710 --> 20:47.870
( gasps)

20:47.910 --> 20:51.448
All right, Aunt Vi!
Congratulations!

20:51.480 --> 20:52.742
( both laughing )

20:52.780 --> 20:54.611
Oh!

20:54.650 --> 20:56.277
And if you hadn't
said what you said,

20:56.320 --> 20:57.719
I wouldn't have done it.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.479
You know I didn't
mean that.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.351
Yeah, you did.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.551
And it's good that you
got dreams for Micah.

21:03.590 --> 21:06.354
And it just reminded me
that I still got a few
of my own.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.755
So, there.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.791
What's all this?

21:10.830 --> 21:13.628
Oh, mill stuff.

21:13.670 --> 21:15.991
Let me ask you something.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.463
How long have the mills
been gouging

21:18.510 --> 21:20.375
at this 40/60 split?

21:20.410 --> 21:21.229
( chuckles )

21:21.280 --> 21:23.578
For as long as anyone
can remember.

21:23.610 --> 21:26.670
For years, your daddy
and every farmer
in this parish

21:26.710 --> 21:28.371
come into
the High Yellow

21:28.420 --> 21:31.082
complaining about how
the mills got them
by the balls.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.783
Because ain't nobody
got that kind of clout.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.458
Not even together.

21:38.490 --> 21:39.923
Nobody around here
but Landry,

21:39.960 --> 21:41.496
and Landry got his own.

21:41.530 --> 21:42.724
His own what?

21:43.930 --> 21:45.397
Wait, Landry has a mill?

21:45.430 --> 21:47.534
He got all the mills, baby.

21:47.570 --> 21:50.095
Landry and the Boudreauxs
are part owners

21:50.140 --> 21:51.960
of every mill
in this parish.

21:52.010 --> 21:54.808
Huh. That's who
I met with today.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.034
Jacob Boudreaux.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.799
The Boudreaux brothers
are Landrys.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.408
Married in
generations ago.

22:00.450 --> 22:03.044
And between them,
they own 15,000 acres

22:03.080 --> 22:05.014
and control all the mills.

22:05.050 --> 22:07.814
So, the Landrys
are the ones

22:07.860 --> 22:09.589
who have everyone
by the balls.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.826
Mm-hmm.

22:10.860 --> 22:12.748
And your daddy spent
his last years

22:12.790 --> 22:14.894
trying to figure out a way
to get out from under them,

22:14.930 --> 22:16.921
just the way
you're doing right now.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.428
I can see _
the wheels turning.

22:19.470 --> 22:23.702
But when you consider that
they control all the mills

22:23.740 --> 22:26.868
and the refineries
and own all the best land,

22:26.910 --> 22:29.936
it's clear it's their world,

22:29.980 --> 22:32.039
and we just surviving in it.

22:48.730 --> 22:49.992
Mommy!

22:50.030 --> 22:52.419
Blue! Mwah!

22:52.470 --> 22:54.461
Kenya wants
a morning kiss, too.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.037
Blue, get your backpack
so your mama can take you
to school.

22:57.070 --> 22:58.867
Okay.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.604
Blue's going to the zoo?

23:03.650 --> 23:05.572
If Aunt Vi sees fit.

23:05.610 --> 23:06.872
What do you mean?

23:06.910 --> 23:09.743
She's still Blue's
legal guardian.

23:12.450 --> 23:14.953
I was locked up.
You was...

23:17.530 --> 23:19.020
in your situation.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.523
I don't even want to
think about what would
have happened to him

23:25.570 --> 23:26.969
if it wasn't for her.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.030
But things are changed now.

23:32.070 --> 23:34.630
I take care of Blue.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.807
I give him
everything he needs.

23:36.840 --> 23:40.105
He's all I got,
all I care about.

23:42.480 --> 23:46.484
B_ut_I still need
permi55ion for my son
to go to a damn zoo.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.488
A zoo.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.078
I'm sorry.

23:52.590 --> 23:54.820
I know how you feel.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.964
( footsteps rushing )

24:00.130 --> 24:03.065
- I'm ready.
- Darla: Okay. Give him a kiss.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.601
Have a good day, buddy.

24:04.640 --> 24:05.834
Come on.

24:13.010 --> 24:14.716
( door opens )

24:15.880 --> 24:16.915
Darla.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.814
You have a good day too,
okay?

24:24.960 --> 24:26.222
Thank you.

24:28.730 --> 24:30.049
( door closes )

24:32.200 --> 24:33.758
( laughs )

24:33.800 --> 24:35.836
Hell no, Vi ain't gonna
start seeing nobody.

24:35.870 --> 24:37.633
She know I got
a little crazy in me.

24:37.670 --> 24:39.706
Can't nobody
control Aunt Vi.

24:39.740 --> 24:41.071
She stay doing
whatever she wants.

24:41.110 --> 24:43.135
She still ain't signed
over Blue, has she?

24:43.180 --> 24:44.841
No.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.144
I don't know how much more
I can take of this, Wood.

24:47.180 --> 24:50.513
Hey, look, she love you,
she love that boy.

24:50.550 --> 24:52.586
She just can't stand Darla.

24:52.620 --> 24:54.952
Really can't
blame her either.

24:54.990 --> 24:57.720
And Darla ain't even
like that no more.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.524
And after all
we've been through?

25:00.560 --> 25:02.050
We ain't ever going
back to that.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.226
I hear you, man.

25:03.260 --> 25:05.524
I filed papers.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.959
About to divorce Leanne.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.092
For real?

25:09.140 --> 25:10.539
Yeah. Got to.

25:10.570 --> 25:12.709
I got to show Vi
I'm serious.

25:12.740 --> 25:15.834
- Think that'll work?
- I don't know.

25:15.880 --> 25:19.998
Just got to show her
that I'm all in, man.

25:20.050 --> 25:21.642
She worth it.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.011
( clicks electric razor off)

25:23.050 --> 25:24.085
( blows )

25:26.950 --> 25:28.611
( music plays
over headphones )

25:28.660 --> 25:30.252
( laughs )
You always dancing.

25:30.290 --> 25:31.518
( laughs )

25:36.030 --> 25:38.089
Oh, that's cool.
I like that.

25:38.130 --> 25:41.167
Everybody was talking
about you today.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.907
Like, "Micah's so cute.
Do y'all go together?"

25:43.940 --> 25:45.805
What'd you tell them?

25:45.840 --> 25:47.102
To mind their business.

25:47.140 --> 25:48.630
( laughs )

25:48.680 --> 25:50.307
- So, what you do today?
- Nothing.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.570
I was supposed to go to this
new student orientation thing

25:52.610 --> 25:53.838
at Gardini Prep,

25:53.880 --> 25:55.643
but I might not
be going there anymore.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.648
What happened?
They found out you was black?

25:57.690 --> 25:59.612
( both laugh )

25:59.650 --> 26:01.584
No.

26:01.620 --> 26:04.828
It's this stupid thing
that happened at my
old school.

26:06.830 --> 26:08.229
I got expelled.

26:08.260 --> 26:09.989
For what?

26:11.800 --> 26:13.791
Okay, so...

26:13.840 --> 26:15.694
my ex had these pictures
in her phone,

26:15.740 --> 26:18.709
and her mom told
the head of the school

26:18.740 --> 26:20.207
I sent them to her.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.198
So she had some dude's—-

26:23.240 --> 26:24.878
Yeah.

26:24.910 --> 26:27.242
On her phone.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.214
It wasn't mine.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.081
Was she white?

26:31.120 --> 26:32.940
Yes.

26:32.990 --> 26:34.218
Hm...

26:34.260 --> 26:35.318
( laughs )
Shut up!

26:35.360 --> 26:37.681
( both laugh )

26:37.730 --> 26:40.085
Why you want to go
to Gardini Prep anyway?

26:40.130 --> 26:42.325
Well, I never had
much of a choice.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.918
And you're cool
with that?

26:45.270 --> 26:47.261
I guess.

26:47.300 --> 26:50.394
Well... the Micah
that I'm trying
to get to know

26:50.440 --> 26:54.103
seems like the type of dude
that makes his own decisions.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.246
If you're gonna do it,
just do it.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.987
( laughs )

27:04.020 --> 27:06.284
Life's short,
and I got to get home.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.747
Seems like the 40/60 split

27:34.780 --> 27:36.008
with the Landry mills

27:36.050 --> 27:37.915
is the only option
on the table.

27:37.950 --> 27:40.384
So I'd be open to bringing
my cane here.

27:45.060 --> 27:48.052
You ever seen
one of these before?

27:49.800 --> 27:51.028
Can't say that I have.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.368
It's a parish assessor's map.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.391
Shows the division
of farmland in St. Josephine.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.737
Right.

27:56.770 --> 27:59.034
I see my farm right there.

27:59.070 --> 28:01.038
My brother Paul and I just
bought a parcel of land

28:01.080 --> 28:04.777
that borders your farm there.

28:04.810 --> 28:07.404
Congratulations.

28:07.450 --> 28:09.315
As you can see,

28:09.350 --> 28:12.717
your land is now
completely surrounded

28:12.750 --> 28:14.411
by our family's land.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.348
Hmm.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.382
The thing is, Mrs. West,

28:20.430 --> 28:23.149
we're happy to have you
grind your cane here,

28:23.200 --> 28:26.727
but we'd like to offer you
an alternative scenario.

28:26.770 --> 28:29.261
An alternative scenario?

28:29.300 --> 28:31.234
I didn't realize
there was one.

28:31.270 --> 28:32.237
There is.

28:32.270 --> 28:36.377
Think of it as an offer
you can't refuse.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.379
I'm listening.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.081
Aunt Vi?

28:48.390 --> 28:50.210
Aunt Vi?

28:54.030 --> 28:55.429
You all right?

28:55.460 --> 28:57.496
How's Blue?

28:57.530 --> 28:59.327
Blue fine.

28:59.370 --> 29:02.999
He just wants to go
to the zoo with his class.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.268
I signed it.

29:06.310 --> 29:07.038
Oh.

29:07.070 --> 29:09.072
But you still
his legal guardian,

29:09.110 --> 29:11.442
so I need you to sign it.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.412
Well, of course.

29:15.450 --> 29:19.011
He loves animals.
He gang to have
a great time.

29:24.990 --> 29:26.787
- Thank you.
- All right.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.233
How you think
I feel right now, Aunt Vi?

29:44.310 --> 29:46.073
I got to ask you
if it's okay

29:46.110 --> 29:49.876
for my son to go on
a school trip?

29:49.920 --> 29:52.343
Baby, he's a child.

29:52.390 --> 29:54.858
They put me in charge
to make sure

29:54.890 --> 29:57.017
somebody is thinking
about him first.

29:57.060 --> 29:58.152
Blue comes first--

29:58.190 --> 30:00.329
He come first to me.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.453
Always.

30:02.500 --> 30:06.891
As long as you fooling around
with that Darla, he don't.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.397
Look, I ain't some
no-count layabout

30:08.440 --> 30:11.068
who only come to see Blue
on Father's Day.

30:11.110 --> 30:14.034
He ain't no game to me.

30:14.080 --> 30:18.073
I've been here all day
every day since I got out.

30:18.110 --> 30:21.011
She is a bad influence
on you, baby.

30:21.050 --> 30:23.416
You don't see it,
but everybody else--

30:23.450 --> 30:24.587
What about Davis?

30:26.090 --> 30:27.318
What about Davis?

30:27.350 --> 30:31.923
You said he got a right
to be a father to Micah,

30:36.060 --> 30:38.392
But I ain't got
the same rights?

30:42.140 --> 30:46.201
When do I get out, Aunt Vi?

30:49.410 --> 30:51.901
I did my time.

30:54.050 --> 30:56.371
When am I done?

31:42.030 --> 31:43.429
I'm here...

31:45.000 --> 31:46.490
whenever you need me.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.408
And there ain't no shame

31:57.440 --> 32:00.307
in needing help sometimes,
you hear?

32:02.080 --> 32:03.445
Yeah.

32:24.470 --> 32:26.199
( oldies music plays
over radio )

32:26.240 --> 32:28.299
( indistinct chatter )

32:35.450 --> 32:38.112
Roberta,
stop swishing
that mop around

32:38.150 --> 32:39.708
like you making iced tea.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.059
Put some elbow grease in it.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.455
And clean up your face.

32:43.490 --> 32:45.651
Don't nobody want
to look at all that.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.634
Hey.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.470
Hey.

33:06.510 --> 33:09.411
Going to be out pushing off
to the rigs tomorrow.

33:09.450 --> 33:12.283
Just wanted to stop by
and congratulate you
on making manager.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.981
You deserve it.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.416
Thank you.

33:16.460 --> 33:19.987
You deserve a lot
of good things, Vi.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.495
Yeah. I do.

33:32.670 --> 33:36.106
I can rustle you up
a cup of coffee.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.607
You want some?

33:57.260 --> 33:59.023
( sugar packet rattles )

34:03.300 --> 34:05.439
( spoon clacks )

34:31.870 --> 34:33.599
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.632
Thanks for telling me
you had my stuff.

34:35.670 --> 34:36.830
I appreciate it.

34:36.870 --> 34:38.337
You're welcome.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.235
Well, thanks.

34:40.270 --> 34:42.204
So we're not going
to talk about this?

34:42.240 --> 34:43.832
Look, there's nothing
to talk about, really.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.542
I mean, it is what it is.

34:46.580 --> 34:50.346
You know, I do things my way
and you do things your way.

34:50.380 --> 34:53.440
What is this really about,
Chantal?

34:53.490 --> 34:56.709
This_isn't about _
your talking p0ints, is it?

34:56.760 --> 34:58.853
The white boy in the framed
pictures in the drawer

34:58.890 --> 35:00.721
on your nightstand table?

35:00.760 --> 35:04.218
His look. His haircut.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.897
That's your ex, Calvin, right?

35:05.930 --> 35:07.761
He's a cop.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.894
How you say you rep us,
but you're running around--?

35:10.940 --> 35:13.534
If I'm with somebody
it's because of who they are,

35:13.570 --> 35:15.276
not because of their job.

35:15.310 --> 35:16.607
And that goes
for you, too.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.143
Educated, conscious people
profess who they are

35:19.180 --> 35:20.704
through their
profession.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.877
What we do says
what we believe in.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.445
Nah, most people just work
to feed themselves
and their families.

35:25.490 --> 35:26.787
They're not trying
to be political.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.549
Everything is not always
so black and white.

35:28.590 --> 35:30.512
Says the sister sleeping
with a white cop

35:30.560 --> 35:32.152
on a racist police force.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.563
Look, I didn't say that
to hurt you.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.727
I'm just telling the truth.

35:49.810 --> 35:51.175
I like his look.

35:52.810 --> 35:54.846
Calvin.

35:57.450 --> 35:58.849
But I like yours, too.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.224
Is that a problem for you?

36:04.260 --> 36:05.557
No, Nova,
it's not a problem.

36:05.590 --> 36:08.491
It's just,
you're all over the place.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.569
I don't know.
Maybe we're just
too different.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.562
Sorry.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.448
( car engine starts )

36:41.700 --> 36:42.894
Thanks for coming,
everybody.

36:45.830 --> 36:48.469
Oh, if this a family meeting,
I should be going home.

36:48.500 --> 36:49.967
You were one of Daddy's
closest friends

36:50.000 --> 36:51.467
and it's about the farm.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.466
So, you need to stay.

36:54.940 --> 36:56.498
Please.

37:01.650 --> 37:04.642
We received a cash offer
to buy our farm.

37:04.690 --> 37:08.581
Four million dollars
from Jacob and Paul Boudreaux.

37:08.620 --> 37:11.623
It's six times
what Sam Landry offered.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.389
That's what
I'm talking about.

37:13.430 --> 37:15.648
Except now I know
the Boudreauxs

37:15.700 --> 37:17.793
and the Landrys
are the same family.

37:17.830 --> 37:20.697
So, why didn't they
tell me that up front?

37:23.300 --> 37:25.939
Wolves in sheep's clothing.

37:25.970 --> 37:31.749
This is the land that belonged
to the Landry's in 1889.

37:31.780 --> 37:34.442
Twenty-six years
after emancipation.

37:34.480 --> 37:37.677
And this is that same land
in 1939.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.347
Still belongs to the Landrys,

37:39.390 --> 37:41.381
except for this part
in the middle.

37:41.420 --> 37:42.751
It belongs to us now.

37:42.790 --> 37:45.520
What you getting at,
Charley?

37:45.560 --> 37:47.653
Something happened here
we haven't been told.

37:47.690 --> 37:51.865
Our farm belonged to the Landry
and Boudreaux families.

37:51.900 --> 37:55.893
So they don't just want
our land, they want it back.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.760
Why?

38:04.850 --> 38:08.968
Y'all know that Ernest
loved this land,

38:09.020 --> 38:11.989
but he wanted y'all
to come to it on your own.

38:13.690 --> 38:15.419
Made us promise
not to tell you.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.813
Unless you ask.

38:18.690 --> 38:23.650
Violet:
Our people worked on Landry
land as sharecroppers.

38:23.700 --> 38:28.797
But during slavery,
they owned us.

38:31.440 --> 38:32.998
Nova: What?

38:33.040 --> 38:34.678
You can trace that?

38:34.710 --> 38:38.498
It was that particular
family for sure?

38:38.550 --> 38:42.077
Yes, we know that
for sure.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.338
My daddy,
Charles Bordelon,

38:44.390 --> 38:46.813
went north during
the migration.

38:46.850 --> 38:50.388
Then more family joined
him in Chicago.

38:50.420 --> 38:51.921
They worked hard,
they made money,

38:51.960 --> 38:54.394
they sent some of that money
back home.

38:54.430 --> 38:56.694
Same as Arturo and Ignacio.

38:56.730 --> 39:00.359
Different faces, same story.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.890
That money came in handy

39:01.940 --> 39:04.500
when the Landrys
fell on hard times

39:04.540 --> 39:06.030
during the Great Depression.

39:07.610 --> 39:10.431
And your
great-great-granddaddy

39:10.480 --> 39:12.107
bought some of their land.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.812
Prosper:
And the way I hear it,

39:14.850 --> 39:16.715
after the Landrys recovered,

39:16.750 --> 39:19.048
they said they'd never
sold it to the Bordelons.

39:19.090 --> 39:23.709
And suddenly nobody
at the bank could
find the deed.

39:25.090 --> 39:26.728
And one night,

39:26.760 --> 39:31.026
the Landrys came
to take the land back.

39:33.170 --> 39:34.831
Oh, God.

39:34.870 --> 39:38.966
Strung up Charles'
eldest brother.

39:39.010 --> 39:43.834
Hung three more Bordelons
over time...

39:45.780 --> 39:48.874
including Granddaddy Angel.

39:48.920 --> 39:54.017
His aunties Millie,
Queenie, and Sara Joe

39:54.050 --> 39:57.451
cut him down
in the dead of night.

39:57.490 --> 40:00.550
Prayed over his body
and soul,

40:00.590 --> 40:02.854
and then buried him right.

40:06.070 --> 40:10.461
Ernest said eventually somebody
came forward with a title.

40:10.500 --> 40:13.901
So, the Landrys and Boudreauxs

40:13.940 --> 40:17.000
started doing everything
they could to make it hard.

40:18.510 --> 40:20.068
Became a sport to them.

40:20.110 --> 40:23.773
Violet:
When your daddy got this farm,

40:23.820 --> 40:27.984
he did everything he could
to make it work.

40:30.660 --> 40:32.787
But they made it so...

40:32.830 --> 40:35.492
They made it so hard.

40:35.530 --> 40:37.919
Yes, they did.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.001
I'm sorry, y'all.

40:51.910 --> 40:54.049
Your daddy didn't
just up and die.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.047
They killed him.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.939
Slow.

41:02.690 --> 41:05.022
Every time he took
a good step,

41:05.060 --> 41:08.826
they found some way
to strike him down.

41:08.860 --> 41:13.468
But hell or high water,
he wouldn't give up.

41:18.770 --> 41:23.935
Not when he knew
what it cost to get it.

41:45.330 --> 41:47.161
( door opens )

42:04.050 --> 42:06.712
This land's been
paid for.

42:06.750 --> 42:09.218
Over and over again.

42:12.090 --> 42:14.797
No more running.

42:14.830 --> 42:16.889
No more taking
the easy way out.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.938
I don't have any answers.

42:23.600 --> 42:24.908
All I know is...

42:24.940 --> 42:27.534
we ain't going nowhere.

42:36.180 --> 42:39.047
( music playing )
