00:07.107 --> 00:09.141
- Previously on <i>the affair...</i>

00:09.143 --> 00:12.745
- I had no idea she was married
when I first met her.

00:12.747 --> 00:15.748
She seemed like
the loneliest girl in the world.

00:15.750 --> 00:20.352
- I was wondering if you--
you still needed a hand.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.221
- I'm noah.
- Cole.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.489
- Which dress?
- That one.

00:23.491 --> 00:24.656
- I think I'm gonna wear
this one.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.425
- This is harry, my agent.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.093
- So bruce tells me
that you're working on something

00:28.095 --> 00:29.495
New this summer?

00:29.497 --> 00:31.230
- Well, I haven't really gotten
too far with it.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.232
- Excuse me, sir.
You ordered whiskey?

00:33.234 --> 00:34.633
- Was she flirting with you?

00:34.635 --> 00:36.502
- You know, you really shouldn't
smoke that here.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.370
- Okay.
Where should we go?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.239
- How is any of this relevant
to what happened?

00:40.241 --> 00:41.774
- Trying to figure out if anyone
might have had a motive

00:41.776 --> 00:42.775
To kill this fellow.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.243
- I thought it was an accident.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.511
- How much longer
is this gonna take?

00:45.513 --> 00:47.112
- I just have
a few more questions.

00:47.114 --> 00:48.447
- I was sure
I'd never see him again.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.249
I remember you.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.117
- I was wondering when
we'd run into each other again.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.819
I'd like to keep talking
with you.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.722
- Got a call about a catering
job tonight if anyone wants it.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.391
- You're that poor little girl
who lost her baby, aren't you?

00:59.393 --> 01:00.826
- Do you wanna get out of here?

01:00.828 --> 01:03.062
There's this hypothesis in
theoretical physics.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.264
Your true life continues as is,
unchanged.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.732
But at the moment of decision,

01:06.734 --> 01:09.535
A new life splits off
into a parallel universe.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.837
- I really doubt it was anyone
at the party that ran him down.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.739
- So you think I'm barking up
the wrong tree?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.841
- I'll do anything to find out
what happened to him.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.109
I can't believe he's gone.

- Noah, is that you?

03:36.316 --> 03:37.883
Come on in for a second.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.793
Sit down.
Relax.

03:53.833 --> 03:58.337
So.
How's the writing coming?

03:58.339 --> 03:59.938
- It's fine.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.241
- It's a nice place to work,
isn't it?

04:02.243 --> 04:07.779
So quiet, so much peace.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.249
I noticed you out there
swimming.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.484
And it reminded me of something
I used to do when I wanted

04:12.486 --> 04:15.454
To avoid the page.

04:15.456 --> 04:19.324
I didn't swim,
but I'd go play tennis.

04:19.326 --> 04:22.594
Four hours a day.
I had a tennis partner,

04:22.596 --> 04:25.597
A little jewish fellow
named arnold.

04:25.599 --> 04:29.668
And I'd beat him roundly
every set.

04:29.670 --> 04:34.740
And I'd come home feeling
so good about myself.

04:34.742 --> 04:38.043
And too tired to write a word.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.946
Finally, margaret said to me,
"bruce, why don't you write

04:40.948 --> 04:44.650
Ten pages and then go play
tennis?"

04:44.652 --> 04:48.353
Well, I took her up on it.

04:48.355 --> 04:49.955
And the next time I saw arnold,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.757
It was a year later.

04:51.759 --> 04:55.060
He whooped my ass.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.829
But I had a <i>new york times</i>
<i> bestseller.</i>

05:08.041 --> 05:12.377
- Well, bruce, I'm gonna go
and--gonna get some clothes on.

05:12.379 --> 05:13.779
- Good.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.751
Noah?

05:22.555 --> 05:25.057
I'm glad we talked.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.914
- Don't wake up.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.794
- Good morning.

06:44.871 --> 06:49.508
What do you think of this one?

06:49.510 --> 06:54.780
- I like it.
- Better than...This one?

06:54.782 --> 06:57.149
- What's the difference?
- The first one's from kenya.

06:57.151 --> 07:00.185
This one's from brazil.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.821
And the kenyan one is made
by a woman's collective,

07:02.823 --> 07:05.624
And the proceeds go to
their daughters' education.

07:05.626 --> 07:09.761
But the brazilian one is made
from recycled cardboard pulp,

07:09.763 --> 07:13.031
Which is kind of amazing.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.099
- Price differential?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.967
- Negligible.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.970
Um, I have to skype this morning
with leslie,

07:18.972 --> 07:21.072
So we can do inventory.
Can you take the kids?

07:21.074 --> 07:23.041
- Well, I'm supposed to have
a breakfast meeting with harry.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.709
- Oh, good, he called you.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.077
- Actually, I called him.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.513
- I told him to call you.
- He didn't.

07:28.515 --> 07:31.183
- Whitney, can you watch trevor
and stacey for a couple hours?

07:31.185 --> 07:35.187
- I can't, grandma got me
an interview to be an au pair.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.956
- What?
- I'll call you right back.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.925
Yes, it's a woman on the board.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.793
Her grandchildren
are visiting from london,

07:41.795 --> 07:43.562
And it's just too much
for her to handle.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.663
- So you thought whitney could
handle it?

07:44.665 --> 07:46.198
- What's that supposed to mean?

07:46.200 --> 07:48.467
- Well, you realize this is
a real responsibility?

07:48.469 --> 07:51.236
You're gonna have to
go there every day

07:51.238 --> 07:53.205
And these people
will be relying on you.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.706
- Mom, can you not talk to me

07:54.708 --> 07:55.707
Like I'm some sort
of delinquent?

07:55.709 --> 07:57.542
- Honestly, helen?

07:57.544 --> 07:59.578
I thought you wanted her to have
something to do this summer

07:59.580 --> 08:03.682
So she didn't get into trouble
having s-e-x.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.585
- They can spell, mom.
They can all spell.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.220
- I'll reschedule the meeting
with harry.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.222
- No, don't, it's important.
I want you to go.

08:10.224 --> 08:14.059
Dad, you're on childcare
this morning.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.138
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.140
Sorry I'm late.
There was a bit of chaos

08:29.142 --> 08:30.642
In the house this morning.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.110
- No, please.
It's not a problem.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.246
Four kids--how do you find
time to do anything?

08:34.248 --> 08:38.583
Never mind write.
- Yeah, I tend to get up early.

08:38.585 --> 08:42.153
- How early do you get up?
- Uh, 5:00, sometimes 4:00.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.922
Write for a few hours before
the kids get up.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.291
- Is that a little tip you
learned from your father-in-law?

08:46.293 --> 08:51.029
- Right, yeah, I guess--
I guess he does that too.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.298
Hey, can I get some coffee?

08:53.300 --> 08:56.067
So thanks for meeting with me.
- Oh, oh, no, it's my pleasure.

08:56.069 --> 08:59.538
I never get the chance to meet
serious young writers anymore.

08:59.540 --> 09:03.742
These days, it's all fantasy or
memoir or cheap detective shit.

09:03.744 --> 09:08.280
Or everyone is self publishing
online and wasting their talent.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.315
Every year I tell myself, you
know what, I'm gonna finally--

09:10.317 --> 09:11.950
I'm gonna get out of
this business

09:11.952 --> 09:15.654
And then, somehow, I don't.
God knows why.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.022
It's not the money.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.825
It might be inertia
or...Fear.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.193
My wife just went back
to get her master's

09:22.195 --> 09:25.297
And we got two kids
in private schools.

09:25.299 --> 09:27.632
I'm sorry, I have no idea why
I'm telling you this.

09:27.634 --> 09:31.770
- That's okay.
I-I'm interested.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.338
- You got an honest face.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.708
Anyone ever tell you that?

09:36.710 --> 09:40.045
- Uh, yeah.
I guess I heard it before.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.646
- Well, you know what?
We can save my life story

09:41.648 --> 09:43.181
For another time.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.350
Why don't you tell me about
this book of yours?

09:45.352 --> 09:48.920
- Well, uh...I'm not sure
there's much to tell yet.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.222
It's kinda why I wanted
to meet with you.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.191
- So you, okay, you said
it was set out here?

09:53.193 --> 09:58.063
- Right.
- So what is it about?

09:58.065 --> 10:03.935
- Well, I think it's about the
death of the american pastoral.

10:03.937 --> 10:08.340
How, uh, the authenticity
of a small tourist town

10:08.342 --> 10:10.075
Gets co-opted
and commercialized

10:10.077 --> 10:13.144
Until it becomes
a parody of itself.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.881
- And...?

10:16.883 --> 10:19.150
- Uh, that's all I got so far.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.852
- Are there any characters?

10:20.854 --> 10:23.688
- Sure, sure, yeah.
No, um...There's a--yeah.

10:23.690 --> 10:27.359
Small town girl, city guy.
They meet, fall in love.

10:27.361 --> 10:30.829
- But...?
- But he's already married.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.863
- And...?
- And so is she.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.632
- Oh.

10:36.702 --> 10:41.139
Well, I've read it before.
- Right.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.341
- So how is it different?

10:46.979 --> 10:49.748
- He kills her.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.117
In the end.

10:52.119 --> 10:55.253
- Okay.
Now I'm interested.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.389
How does he do it?

10:57.391 --> 10:59.391
- I don't know.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.292
- Why does he do it?

11:01.294 --> 11:03.895
- I don't know that either.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.265
- To save himself and protect
the life that he's got?

11:07.267 --> 11:09.401
- Right.

11:09.403 --> 11:13.071
- So this publishing house
that you're with.

11:13.073 --> 11:16.441
- Wind chime press.
- You sign a contract?

11:16.443 --> 11:18.176
- No, no.
Handshake deal.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.011
- Good.
Well, I tell you what.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.681
When you got some pages, I want
you to show them to me first.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.783
- Okay, great.
I'll do that.

11:24.785 --> 11:28.219
- Good.
- Thanks.

11:48.974 --> 11:52.477
- I remember you.
Four kids, right?

11:52.479 --> 11:55.180
- Uh, yeah, yeah, that's me.
- Left them at home today?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.815
Table for one?
- Oh, no, no, no.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.184
No, actually, no,
I'm just here to, um...

11:59.186 --> 12:02.787
I-I gotta...Buy a couple
t-shirts for my kids.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.322
- Oh, great.
Come with me.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.925
- Thanks.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.327
- So I've got a child's small,
child's medium,

12:09.329 --> 12:11.830
And two adult smalls.

12:11.832 --> 12:15.200
That'll be an even 100.
- Dollars?

12:15.202 --> 12:20.338
- Yeah, sorry.
They are not cheap.

12:20.340 --> 12:24.342
- So, um, there was this girl
working here last time we came.

12:24.344 --> 12:28.379
- What's she look like?
- She had long brown hair.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.281
She--pretty.
- Alison?

12:30.283 --> 12:33.251
Yeah, she's not in right now.
- Okay.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.153
- Were you looking for her?
- No, no, no.

12:35.155 --> 12:39.257
She's just, um--I just wanted
to thank her for something.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.293
- Oh, I'll let her know
you stopped by.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.763
- Great, thanks, man.
- You got it.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.502
- Say, is there a library
in town?

13:43.088 --> 13:45.190
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.091
- I heard you were looking
for me.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.894
- Yeah, I'm just, uh, I'm doing
some research for my book.

13:49.896 --> 13:54.432
- Oh, how about a tour
of the island?

13:54.434 --> 13:55.900
- Uh, actually, can we talk
for a second?

13:55.902 --> 13:57.402
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

14:00.906 --> 14:06.444
So, uh...

14:06.446 --> 14:08.913
Look, how do I...

14:08.915 --> 14:14.452
I really like you.
But...

14:14.454 --> 14:18.089
- You're married.
- Right.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.625
- And you have a family.
- I do.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.061
- And you love them.
- Of course.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.331
- And you don't want to do
anything to jeopardize that.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.499
- You just made that
pretty easy for me.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.201
- I get it.
Of course I do.

14:30.203 --> 14:34.272
- [relieved sigh]
thank you.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.075
- Let's just be friends.
How does that sound?

14:37.077 --> 14:39.611
- That sounds great.
- Okay.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.079
So if you need help
with your book

14:41.081 --> 14:42.347
Or you need someone to talk to,

14:42.349 --> 14:45.016
Feel free to call me.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.054
But I promise,
I won't call you.

15:03.502 --> 15:07.171
- Hey, where ya headed, friend?

15:14.980 --> 15:18.249
- Hey, will.
- Hey, alison.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.919
This is my friend, noah.
He wants to buy some fish.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.287
- Hi.
- Great.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.322
We hit a round of porgies
last night, man.

15:24.324 --> 15:27.258
Does that interest you?
- Sure.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.660
Uh, well, I don't know
what they are exactly.

15:28.662 --> 15:30.261
But--
- they're good.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.997
And rare for these parts.
Buy 'em.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.133
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

15:35.135 --> 15:38.569
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:38.571 --> 15:42.040
- Mr. Solloway.
It's good to see you again.

15:42.042 --> 15:45.043
Scotty lockhart.
- Hi, scotty.

15:45.045 --> 15:48.413
- I see you discovered
the best kept secret in montauk.

15:48.415 --> 15:51.349
Will is like
the pied piper of fish.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.185
We keep him on something of
a monthly retainer at the ranch.

15:54.187 --> 15:58.222
Isn't that right, alison?
- That's right, scotty.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.625
- Well, it was good to
bump into you both.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.227
Don't let my sister-in-law
monopolize too much

16:03.229 --> 16:06.030
Of your time, mr. Solloway.
She's a talker.

16:06.032 --> 16:09.701
- [forced chuckle]

16:09.703 --> 16:12.303
- Oh, I invited myself over
for dinner tonight

16:12.305 --> 16:15.206
After the town hall.
So I hope that's okay.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.742
Cole says he's making ribs.
- Great.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.978
See you then.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.187
- You okay?
- Yeah.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.556
Fine.

16:33.058 --> 16:34.625
- You still want those fish,
man?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.995
- Oh, uh, uh...
No, thanks.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.663
Maybe next time.

16:43.068 --> 16:47.205
So there's a town hall tonight.
- Yep.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.341
- What's on the agenda?
- Mostly bullshit.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.377
- Can I come see it?

16:52.379 --> 16:55.546
I mean, is it open
to the public?

16:55.548 --> 16:57.615
- Yeah, I think so.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.759
- No, stop.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

17:07.761 --> 17:10.762
Stop.
Didn't we talk about this?

17:10.764 --> 17:13.364
Come on.
Remember what I said.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.300
- You didn't say it, I did.
- Sure, whatever.

17:16.302 --> 17:18.703
Point is, I--

17:18.705 --> 17:21.539
- Okay.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.409
I get it.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.378
See you around.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.825
[silverware clinks]
- that was delicious, miranda.

17:40.827 --> 17:46.431
Thank you, I want to get
the recipe before we go.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.800
- Trevor?
- Yes, grandma?

17:48.802 --> 17:51.135
- Those peas are dead.
- I know.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.738
- Well, it's not necessary
to stab them with the cutlery.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.573
Why don't you try
using your knife

17:55.575 --> 17:58.409
To encourage them
upon the fork

17:58.411 --> 18:00.611
And then lift them all
gracefully to your mouth?

18:00.613 --> 18:02.313
- Mom?
- You can ignore her.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.681
It's okay.
Just finish your soup, honey.

18:03.683 --> 18:04.849
- So how'd it go today, whit?

18:04.851 --> 18:06.684
- Awful.
The kids are spoiled brats.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.686
- Really?
What's that like?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.354
- They don't do anything
I ask them to,

18:10.356 --> 18:12.156
And the mother
doesn't trust me anyway.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.592
She was hovering the whole time,
correcting everything I did.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.693
Oh, and the father's a lech.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.295
- A lech?
- Yeah.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.097
I caught him staring at my butt,
like, five times.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.364
- Okay, that's it.
She's not going back there.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.100
- Well, let's talk
about it later.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.468
- What's to talk about?
You heard what she said.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.336
- Yeah, I heard.
- And?

18:25.338 --> 18:28.106
- And I think whitney has
a tendency to exaggerate

18:28.108 --> 18:29.874
When she wants
to be persuasive.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.609
- Oh, great,
so you're calling me a liar now?

18:31.611 --> 18:34.178
- Sounds to me like the fellow
has taste.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.847
You can't fault him for that.
- Grandpa!

18:35.849 --> 18:37.615
- Yeah, dad,
stay out of this, please.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.183
- May I be excused?
- No.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.586
- May I be excused?
- Children, please.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.354
How do you think it makes
miranda feel when you ask

18:43.356 --> 18:45.490
To leave the table in the middle
of the second course

18:45.492 --> 18:46.591
After all the work she's done?

18:46.593 --> 18:48.226
- Miranda doesn't give a shit

18:48.228 --> 18:49.594
'cause she's getting paid
either way.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.596
- Excuse me?
- I heard, I heard what he said.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.598
He said miranda
doesn't give a--ow!

18:53.600 --> 18:56.734
- Just because daddy curses
doesn't mean you can.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.904
Daddy's a grown-up.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.406
- Quite right.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.774
[chuckles]

19:03.776 --> 19:05.543
- When your mother and father
got engaged,

19:05.545 --> 19:07.612
I was mildly alarmed.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.381
- Trevor, open your eyes.
The obvious move is the bishop.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.417
- I never thought they'd
actually go through with it.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.486
- She was thinking
I'd come to my senses

19:15.488 --> 19:16.821
And marry alex jamison.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.656
- I was lighting candles
day and night.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.225
- Like that?
- No, not like that.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.828
That's check, or I could take
your queen like that.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.930
- Alex jamison was gay.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.899
Everybody knew it except you.

19:27.901 --> 19:31.302
- No, I knew it, I just didn't
think it was a deal breaker.

19:31.304 --> 19:34.939
Anyway, the day of the wedding,
I broke out in hives.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.241
- That's so not true.
- I did.

19:37.243 --> 19:38.276
Dr. Laemmle
had to come to the church

19:38.278 --> 19:39.710
To give me a steroid shot.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.245
- It's true.
He did.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.548
- Why'd you break into hives,
grandma?

19:43.550 --> 19:44.949
- I was stressed, my love.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.785
I thought, my darling daughter,
21 years old,

19:47.787 --> 19:49.520
Knows nothing about life,

19:49.522 --> 19:54.792
About to wed her fate
to this--this idealist.

19:54.794 --> 19:58.429
- Oh, no, that does sound like
a nightmare--idealist?

19:58.431 --> 20:01.465
- Idealism is fine
when you're young.

20:01.467 --> 20:05.203
Just don't forget the need
to find a man who can evolve.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.606
- Evolve to what?
- To pragmatism.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.342
- Which looks like
exactly what, margaret?

20:11.344 --> 20:13.711
- Please don't take the bait.
- No, no, no.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.880
Pragmatism equals money,
doesn't it?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.815
- That's the way the world
works, noah, like it or not.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.684
- I know this doesn't make a lot
of sense to you,

20:19.686 --> 20:21.285
But helen and I are trying

20:21.287 --> 20:24.488
To raise decent human beings,
good citizens,

20:24.490 --> 20:27.825
Not just happy idiots
with nothing in their heads

20:27.827 --> 20:31.229
But how to get more, spend more,
make more.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.731
- Is that what you really think
about us, noah?

20:33.733 --> 20:35.433
As you accept our money

20:35.435 --> 20:37.568
For private school tuitions,
the down payment on--

20:37.570 --> 20:39.003
- Oh, we're very grateful
for everything you've given us.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.638
- You have an odd way
of showing it.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.875
- Mom, stop trying to pick
a fight with my husband.

20:44.877 --> 20:48.246
- We'll talk about it later,
just the two of us.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.254
- Can't change her.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.024
- [clears throat]

21:00.026 --> 21:01.325
I'm gonna go out
for a little bit.

21:01.327 --> 21:02.627
- Now?

21:02.629 --> 21:04.362
- Yeah,
there's a town hall meeting.

21:04.364 --> 21:08.799
I just want to, uh, get
a little background for my book.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.468
- Okay.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.869
- See you later.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.938
- Bye.

21:40.832 --> 21:42.700
- Hey, man.
What are you doing here?

21:42.702 --> 21:45.803
- Oh, hey. I don't know, I
thought it might be interesting.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.071
Missed it, I guess.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.939
- You didn't miss anything,
really.

21:48.941 --> 21:52.643
Lockharts fucking pissed
all over everything, as usual.

21:52.645 --> 21:56.547
Then everyone else got drunk.
Now we're all going home.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.316
Oh, your girl's here,
by the way.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.051
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:00.053 --> 22:01.686
- My girl?

22:01.688 --> 22:03.387
- Yeah, weren't you looking
for alison earlier?

22:03.389 --> 22:05.389
- No.
- No?

22:05.391 --> 22:08.326
- No, no, I think
you must have misunderstood.

22:13.932 --> 22:15.933
- I'm sure I did.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.568
[chuckles]

22:17.570 --> 22:19.870
Nice to see you again, buddy.
Have a good night.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.872
- Night.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.913
- You made it.

22:30.949 --> 22:33.484
Are you all right?

22:33.486 --> 22:36.420
Hey, what's going on?

22:36.422 --> 22:39.490
- Can we go somewhere and talk?
Alone?

22:39.492 --> 22:43.828
Is there anywhere private
on this whole fucking island?

22:43.830 --> 22:46.430
- Yes, of course.

22:46.432 --> 22:49.900
Hey, follow me.

22:56.108 --> 22:57.975
- Won't your husband
wonder where you are?

22:57.977 --> 23:01.779
- Probably not.
We're pretty independent.

23:04.983 --> 23:06.117
[sighs]

23:06.119 --> 23:09.120
Are you okay?
- No.

23:09.122 --> 23:11.589
- You want to talk about it?

23:16.628 --> 23:19.029
- I can't stop thinking
about you.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.531
- That's sweet.
- It's not sweet.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.133
It's--it's a fucking problem.

23:22.135 --> 23:24.135
- Okay.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.606
- I can't sleep.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.642
If I do, when I wake up,
I'm thinking about you.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.411
I'm talking to my kids,
I'm thinking about you.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.946
I'm fucking my wife,

23:35.948 --> 23:38.649
I'm thinking about you.

23:38.651 --> 23:39.917
- If it makes you feel
any better,

23:39.919 --> 23:43.821
I think about you
all the time too.

23:43.823 --> 23:47.425
- It doesn't make me feel
any better, no.

23:47.427 --> 23:50.194
- Okay.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.430
- Oh, my god.

23:54.833 --> 23:57.168
What am I gonna do?

24:04.209 --> 24:07.678
- You could just fuck me.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.915
Get it out of your system.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.818
- No.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.487
- Just a thought.

24:22.961 --> 24:26.464
- Stop.
Stop, stop it.

24:26.466 --> 24:30.468
I said stop it.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.069
- Okay.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.872
I thought you wanted this.

24:34.874 --> 24:37.675
- Listen.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.044
You can't rush me.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.186
[belt clinking]

24:51.223 --> 24:53.023
We have to do this at my speed,
okay?

24:53.025 --> 24:55.493
- Okay.

24:58.263 --> 25:01.265
- I know
I sound like an asshole.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.701
But I want to be in charge,
okay?

25:03.703 --> 25:07.004
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.739
Kiss me.

25:12.844 --> 25:15.846
- [moaning]

25:39.137 --> 25:43.741
[thudding on tv]
- I am so sick of this shit.

25:43.743 --> 25:47.144
I can't stand him,
and I hate this goddamn car.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.079
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

25:49.081 --> 25:51.015
You love a car.

25:51.017 --> 25:55.986
You son of a bitch.
[thudding on tv continues]

26:02.027 --> 26:04.094
Good.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.766
My father will come home.
He'll see what I did.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.734
I can't hide this.

26:13.638 --> 26:14.772
He'll come home.
He'll see what I did.

26:14.774 --> 26:18.576
He'll have to deal with me.

26:18.578 --> 26:21.712
I don't care,
I really don't.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.982
I'm just tired
of being afraid.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.350
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:26.352 --> 26:29.320
- How'd it go?
- It was okay.

26:29.322 --> 26:31.655
- You get good stuff?
- Yeah.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.357
- Mom, you're missing
the best part.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.626
- I can't wait to see the look
on the bastard's face.

26:37.128 --> 26:39.330
[tires screech on tv]

26:43.935 --> 26:46.270
[laughter]

26:50.942 --> 26:52.142
What'd I do?

26:52.144 --> 26:54.812
[laughter continues]

27:00.819 --> 27:02.853
- If I were you,
I'd be talking to oscar hodges.

27:02.855 --> 27:06.690

41:29.087 --> 41:30.553
These commercial fishing boats
came in

41:30.555 --> 41:32.121
With huge nets,
these dragger nets.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.990
And they dragged them
along the floor of the ocean

41:33.992 --> 41:35.592
And took everything with it.

41:35.594 --> 41:38.962
The fish, yes,
but also the coral, the kelp.

41:38.964 --> 41:39.963
All of it.

41:39.965 --> 41:43.099
It was rape.

41:43.101 --> 41:44.868
If you're gonna write
about a fisherman,

41:44.870 --> 41:47.971
You should probably spend as
much time down here as possible.

41:47.973 --> 41:51.708
You know, I could introduce you
to some real guys.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.877
They might take you out on a run
with them.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.778
- That would be amazing.
- It's hard, though, you know.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.280
It's not like charter fishing.

41:57.282 --> 41:58.715
You go out in the evening.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.250
You're not back
till the morning.

42:00.252 --> 42:01.751
You sleep on the boat
in shifts.

42:01.753 --> 42:05.154
It's cold.
It's wet.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.524
The ocean is mean.

42:07.526 --> 42:10.059
- You don't think
I could handle it?

42:10.061 --> 42:11.728
- I think
you're a summer person.

42:11.730 --> 42:14.264
- [chuckles]
what's that mean?

42:14.266 --> 42:15.298
- Well, I think
you have a fantasy

42:15.300 --> 42:17.600
Of what life is out here.

42:17.602 --> 42:20.303
It's a small town.
It's idyllic.

42:20.305 --> 42:24.007
We're simple, humble people
who love the sea, right?

42:26.810 --> 42:28.945
- So what's it really like?

42:39.189 --> 42:40.189
[footsteps approaching]

42:40.191 --> 42:42.225
- Wait, stop.

42:48.065 --> 42:52.101

- No.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.237
[sighs]
I can't--

42:54.239 --> 42:55.972
I don't know what I'm doing.
We can't do this.

42:55.974 --> 42:58.575
- You're right, you're right.
- I live here.

42:58.577 --> 42:59.709
You can leave
whenever you want to,

42:59.711 --> 43:01.177
But this is my home, and--

43:01.179 --> 43:03.913
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.182
But it's just, something about
you drives me fucking insane.

43:06.184 --> 43:09.919
- I don't think we should see
each other anymore, okay?

43:09.921 --> 43:12.355
I just--

43:12.357 --> 43:15.358
- Oh, come on.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.793
Look, I need your help
with the book.

43:16.795 --> 43:19.662
You're my insider.

43:19.664 --> 43:21.130
Okay, from now on,

43:21.132 --> 43:24.734
This is just a strictly
professional relationship, okay?

43:24.736 --> 43:27.070
Okay?

43:27.072 --> 43:29.706
- Okay.

43:29.708 --> 43:33.343
- If your hand just happens
to find its way into my pants,

43:33.345 --> 43:34.811
Then I will remove it promptly

43:34.813 --> 43:39.816
And admonish you
for your vulgarity.

43:39.818 --> 43:42.118
You don't believe me?
- No.

43:42.120 --> 43:45.355
- Well, go ahead, try it.
See what happens.

43:48.158 --> 43:50.293
[laughs]

43:55.265 --> 43:59.202
Well, good-bye, friend.

44:01.705 --> 44:04.807
Thanks for the tour.

44:12.783 --> 44:14.884
- There's a town board meeting
tonight,

44:14.886 --> 44:20.189
If you want to get a sense
of the local politics.

44:20.191 --> 44:21.190
- What time?

44:21.192 --> 44:24.927
- 6:30 at the firehouse.

44:24.929 --> 44:27.997
- I may stop by for a bit
before dinner.

44:27.999 --> 44:30.400
- My husband will be there.

44:30.402 --> 44:32.135
- Got it.

44:32.137 --> 44:35.004
I'll keep my distance.

44:38.142 --> 44:40.443
- What did I miss?
- Well, let's see.

44:40.445 --> 44:42.879
Well, the deer are eating
mrs. Ruhl's vegetable garden.

44:42.881 --> 44:45.448
Sunflowers will not work, and if
we don't do anything about it,

44:45.450 --> 44:47.016
She's just gonna shoot them,

44:47.018 --> 44:48.284
And we'll all have
to get used to it.

44:48.286 --> 44:49.819
Oh, and you missed alec baldwin.

44:49.821 --> 44:51.187
He was here defending his right
to privacy.

44:51.189 --> 44:53.022
- Oh, again?
- Mm-hmm.

44:53.024 --> 44:54.757
And richard dunne drafted
a gathering law.

44:54.759 --> 44:55.758
- Saying what?
- You can't, basically.

44:55.760 --> 44:56.959
- Right.

44:56.961 --> 44:58.027
- And then
the shellfish hatchery

44:58.029 --> 45:00.296
Gave their annual report.

45:00.298 --> 45:01.831
And judy burke wants the board

45:01.833 --> 45:02.899
To repair her stairs
down at point beach.

45:02.901 --> 45:04.167
- Hey, all.

45:04.169 --> 45:05.435
- Great.
- I think that's it.

45:05.437 --> 45:07.036
- Oh, wow,
so, as some of you know...

45:07.038 --> 45:08.237
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

45:08.239 --> 45:09.439
- My blueprints
have been finalized,

45:09.441 --> 45:12.942
And my financing
is in place.

45:12.944 --> 45:15.111
All we need are the permits,
and we can break ground on it

45:15.113 --> 45:17.346
At the end of the summer.

45:17.348 --> 45:19.449
I laid out my business plan,
my vision,

45:19.451 --> 45:22.485
And the economic benefit to
our town in packets by the door.

45:22.487 --> 45:24.187
But I came here tonight

45:24.189 --> 45:27.123
To answer any additional
questions you may have.

45:27.125 --> 45:29.325
I really think this is a win-win
for the community.

45:29.327 --> 45:30.827
- Thank you, oscar.

45:30.829 --> 45:33.129
As all of the relevant agencies
have weighed in,

45:33.131 --> 45:36.733
We are now ready to hear
public comment on this project.

45:36.735 --> 45:39.402
- I just want to voice
my support.

45:39.404 --> 45:41.471
I've been going to the lobster
roll for my whole life.

45:41.473 --> 45:43.806
It's an institution.

45:43.808 --> 45:45.742
And if this is
what oscar feels

45:45.744 --> 45:48.144
He needs to do to grow
his business, I support that.

45:48.146 --> 45:49.278
100%.
[applause]

45:49.280 --> 45:52.115
- Thanks, man.
- Anyone else?

45:52.117 --> 45:54.217
- When are you
hoping to start?

45:54.219 --> 45:57.286
- Uh, right after labor day,
soon as the season's over.

45:57.288 --> 45:59.889
- 'cause traffic's bad enough
at that intersection

45:59.891 --> 46:02.225
Without trucks
and heavy equipment and such.

46:02.227 --> 46:03.960
- Mm-hmm, we're taking that
into account, virginia.

46:03.962 --> 46:05.995
- Are you?

46:05.997 --> 46:08.898
Is it true this new bar of yours
is gonna have a bowling alley?

46:08.900 --> 46:11.000
- It's not a bar.
It's an entertainment center.

46:11.002 --> 46:14.303
If you bothered to check
the packet, you'd see that.

46:18.242 --> 46:20.109
- Look, those of you
who know me

46:20.111 --> 46:22.545
Know that I derive no joy
from speaking publicly.

46:22.547 --> 46:26.249
I'd far rather let scotty talk
at these meetings.

46:26.251 --> 46:27.850
He'd sell tea to the chinese.

46:27.852 --> 46:29.452
[scattered chuckles]

46:29.454 --> 46:31.854
When I was a child,

46:31.856 --> 46:34.390
My father would take me riding
right down montauk highway,

46:34.392 --> 46:37.393
Back in the days when we
used to know everybody in town,

46:37.395 --> 46:39.395
Including the summer people,

46:39.397 --> 46:42.999
'cause they used to come back
year after year after year.

46:43.001 --> 46:46.402
And there were surfers,

46:46.404 --> 46:50.072
Families with small children,
artists.

46:50.074 --> 46:52.942
And they came out here looking
for a quiet, tranquil community

46:52.944 --> 46:54.911
Where they could escape the
pressures of their city life,

46:54.913 --> 46:57.446
And that's what we gave them.

46:57.448 --> 46:59.282
We lived in a kind of harmony
with them,

46:59.284 --> 47:01.450
And they respected
the services that we provided,

47:01.452 --> 47:03.152
And when they left
at the end of August,

47:03.154 --> 47:06.289
We wished them a good year,
and we meant it.

47:06.291 --> 47:08.157
Nowadays, when I drive
around this town in the summer,

47:08.159 --> 47:10.026
I don't even know where I am.

47:10.028 --> 47:11.294
I mean, the people
who come out here,

47:11.296 --> 47:13.162
They think
they're in east hampton,

47:13.164 --> 47:15.565
And that's because of places
like the end and navy beach

47:15.567 --> 47:17.300
And this fiasco
that oscar is proposing.

47:17.302 --> 47:18.835
- I'm creating jobs.

47:18.837 --> 47:20.102
Who the hell
have you hired lately?

47:20.104 --> 47:22.171
- I grew up here.
- So did I.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.339
- So then, I'm asking you,

47:23.341 --> 47:25.341
As a local,
as a fellow native son,

47:25.343 --> 47:27.109
Don't turn this place
into the jersey shore.

47:27.111 --> 47:29.045
People want to bowl,
let them go to riverhead.

47:29.047 --> 47:31.214
- Cole, what's hap--
what's happening out here

47:31.216 --> 47:32.448
Is called progress.

47:32.450 --> 47:35.051
- No, it's called greed.

47:35.053 --> 47:36.619
It's the pursuit
of the almighty dollar,

47:36.621 --> 47:38.588
And it's gonna be
the downfall of all of us.

47:38.590 --> 47:41.257
My family's been in montauk
for seven generations.

47:41.259 --> 47:44.327
My wife was born here,

47:44.329 --> 47:48.130
And my son is buried here.

47:48.132 --> 47:49.632
This is sacred ground to me,

47:49.634 --> 47:51.200
And I don't want too much
from life,

47:51.202 --> 47:54.604
But I want my wife,
and I want my family,

47:54.606 --> 47:57.073
And I want this land.

47:57.075 --> 47:58.941
And I know I'm not the only one

47:58.943 --> 48:02.111
Because this is our town,
these are our schools,

48:02.113 --> 48:05.214
Our churches, our beaches,
our docks, our sunrise,

48:05.216 --> 48:08.217
Our little piece of heaven
under god.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.986
And I am never leaving
this place,

48:09.988 --> 48:14.156
Because I am gonna be buried
right there next to my boy,

48:14.158 --> 48:16.359
And I will fight like hell
to my last breath

48:16.361 --> 48:18.294
To keep montauk local.

48:18.296 --> 48:20.563
[cheers and applause]

48:20.565 --> 48:25.034
- People. People!
All right.

48:25.036 --> 48:27.970
Perhaps we ought to entertain
a motion for further study

48:27.972 --> 48:31.374
Before a vote on whether to
issue permits for this project.

You were amazing.

would be very proud.

48:37.115 --> 48:38.514

- Very proud, cole.

48:38.516 --> 48:39.682

- Good job, bro.

48:39.684 --> 48:43.552

in this ground"?

48:53.665 --> 48:55.932
- He is.
- You can't do that.

48:55.934 --> 48:59.936
You can't use his memory to make
some kind of statement.

Hey!

for the community?

center or a walk-in clinic.

king of the community, huh?

upset right now,

But we just want
what's best for this town.

49:26.597 --> 49:30.700
- And there was no love lost
between him and the lockharts?

49:30.702 --> 49:35.104
- That's an understatement.

49:35.106 --> 49:37.707

to the wedding?

we may hurt each other,

no matter what.

why you were there.

you need me for, detective?
