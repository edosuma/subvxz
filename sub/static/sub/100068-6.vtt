WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:04.605
ANNOUNCER:
An FX original series.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.174
Mr. InBetween.

00:07.275 --> 00:10.744
All new,
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.348
ANNOUNCER: FXX presents...

00:14.382 --> 00:16.784
It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.092
CHARLIE:
I suppose I should
start at the end.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.926
My end, that is.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.299
That poor sap doing
the two-step to nowhere is me.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.634
Bet you're wondering
how I got into this mess.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.903
Well, like most stories,
it started with a white lie

00:36.003 --> 00:37.438
and ended with the dark truth.

00:37.471 --> 00:40.108
I needed a hospital,
I needed a day off,

00:40.141 --> 00:43.411
I needed a pretty girl with
soft lips and a nursing degree.

00:43.511 --> 00:47.047
What I had was a mop, a bucket,
and a bellyful of regret.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.616
(grunts)

00:51.152 --> 00:53.321
So, how does an honest man
end up spilling his guts

00:53.421 --> 00:54.988
on a dive bar floor?

00:55.089 --> 00:59.059
Don't ask me, pal.
I'm just the janitor.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.819
CHARLIE: Let's go back
to when it all began.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.921
It was a wet Tuesday night,
half past closing time,

01:28.021 --> 01:29.657
when the drunks wobble home
to their beds

01:29.690 --> 01:32.660
and punch their tickets to
an all-night ceiling-go-round.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.795
I had already finished
my shift,

01:34.828 --> 01:36.430
or maybe it had finished me.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.499
See, that morning I got called
to a crime scene

01:38.532 --> 01:39.767
in the men's bathroom.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.770
The victim?
A handicap stall.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.505
The murderer? A butt.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.474
But whose butt?

01:46.507 --> 01:49.143
That, my friends, was
the hundred-dollar question.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.345
Ah, the hell with it.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.880
(exhales)

01:52.980 --> 01:56.650
And that's when trouble walked
in like it always does,

01:56.684 --> 01:59.820
on a great set of legs.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.655
I got a job for you.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.492
-Not interested.
-Well, I ain't asking.

02:04.525 --> 02:07.161
Somebody spilled,
and I don't mean to the Feds.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.497
So? You know where
we keep the mop.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.832
-I'm knocking off.
-Knocking off?

02:11.865 --> 02:13.467
-Or knocking back?
-Beat it, Stretch.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.237
-I said I'm off the clock.
-Oh. Want it the hard way, huh?

02:16.337 --> 02:18.406
(whistles)

02:18.506 --> 02:20.007
Says he won't do it.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.042
Ah, we got a tough guy, eh?

02:22.142 --> 02:25.479
Hey, Charlie, don't make me
mop the floor with you, huh?

02:25.513 --> 02:26.814
(knuckles crack)

02:26.847 --> 02:29.049
Boy, has he got you trained.
All that for a whistle?

02:29.082 --> 02:31.519
I wonder what you'd do
for a biscuit.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.121
Biscuit? Why, you little...

02:34.154 --> 02:36.690
(muffled grunting)

02:36.790 --> 02:38.692
(exhales)

02:38.792 --> 02:40.394
Don't worry. In five minutes,

02:40.494 --> 02:42.696
he'll be up
and chasing his tail again.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.499
You're gonna mop that floor,
Charlie, or else.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.000
You see, the bar's been
rented out tomorrow

02:47.100 --> 02:48.502
for a private party.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.137
Bigwig. Deep pockets.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.305
You know the type.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.806
If those floors
aren't up to snuff,

02:52.840 --> 02:54.141
who do you think he'll blame?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.143
The handsome bartender?

02:56.176 --> 02:59.713
Or the mop jockey
in the coveralls?

02:59.813 --> 03:01.949
See you around, Charlie.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.720
CHARLIE:
Mop the floor.
That's easy enough.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.889
Only it never stays mopped.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.425
That's the thing about messes.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.827
They never go away,

03:13.861 --> 03:15.863
only spread around.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.301
(door creaks)

03:21.402 --> 03:23.170
Well, hello, sweetheart.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.205
You know,
they say any port in a storm,

03:25.306 --> 03:27.941
and this port just--
ah, shit, it's you.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.611
Charlie, come quick. Something
awful, just awful's happened.

03:30.644 --> 03:34.114
It's Frank.
He's been diarrhea-poisoned.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.216
(thunder crashes)

03:36.317 --> 03:38.552
-Diarrhea-poisoned?
-Mm-hmm.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.721
His words, not mine.
He's stuck at my place.

03:40.821 --> 03:44.658
He's absolutely carpet-bombed
my bathroom. And my carpet.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.060
-Huh. Lot of that going around.
-Hmm.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.097
Well, why didn't Frank
call me himself?

03:50.130 --> 03:51.465
Why send one of his goons?

03:51.499 --> 03:52.966
What? I'm no goon.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.135
-No?
-No. I... (sighs)

03:55.168 --> 03:56.637
I'm a knockout blonde
with a body

03:56.737 --> 03:58.639
that would make a statue blush.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.140
I get more of a goon vibe
from you.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.475
All right, go...
(groans)

04:01.509 --> 04:04.144
Can you just come
and get him, please?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.780
And also clean my apartment?

04:06.814 --> 04:08.782
I'll make it worth your while.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.117
Ah, sure, I catch.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.752
Either I take the job,
or you and the other goons

04:11.852 --> 04:13.787
-play patty-cake
with my kidneys.
-Goddamn it!

04:13.821 --> 04:15.789
I'm not a...
(groans)

04:15.823 --> 04:17.658
I'll buy you a new set of rags.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.927
Hey, that's all you had to say.
Let me get my hat.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.795
(groans)

04:28.469 --> 04:31.372
He's in the bedroom.
Here, take a smoke.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.040
It smells like shit in there.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.775
All right.
I'll also take a drink.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.777
Make it stiff enough
to stand on its head

04:36.810 --> 04:39.947
and sing "Oh! Susanna."

04:39.980 --> 04:42.149
You can have tap.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.056
(grunts)
Boy.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.692
Charlie. What are you doing
here? Who sent you?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.661
Well, you're in the hot seat,
so I'll ask the questions.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.295
-Who poisoned you?
-Nobody.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.531
-Bad shrimp.
-What? No.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.700
No, this morning you barged
in here saying, "They got me.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.034
"I've been diarrhea-poisoned.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.670
The rat bastard liquefied
my guts."

05:02.770 --> 05:04.004
That sounds like you.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.073
-Quit flapping your gums, goon!
-(stomach grumbles)

05:06.173 --> 05:07.841
-Yeah.
-All right, you know what?

05:07.875 --> 05:09.176
-Just, whatever. Here.
-You're giving off

05:09.209 --> 05:10.544
-big goon vibes, Dee.
-All right. Uh...

05:10.644 --> 05:11.745
-Very goonish.
-DEE: Just don't ruin my chair.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.647
Goddamn it.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.449
CHARLIE:
All right, Frank,
you don't want to talk names?

05:15.483 --> 05:16.984
Let's talk about
the weather instead.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.619
Where were you
when the brown lightning hit?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.821
I was on my way to work.
I bumped into a dope fiend.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.990
He must have stuck me
with a needle.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.059
Don't be a liar, Frankie-Boy, or
your pants will catch on fire.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.463
Or they would,
if you were wearing any pants.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.632
No, my guess is,
it started some time last night

05:31.665 --> 05:33.233
when you were
locking up Paddy's.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.168
You waited out the shit storm
in the handicap stall.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.004
When I came in in the morning,
you fled the scene,

05:37.037 --> 05:38.672
hightailed it to the nearest
apartment-- Dee's--

05:38.706 --> 05:40.173
only your pants
didn't make the trip.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.341
How am I doing?

05:41.375 --> 05:42.510
-(grunts)
-So that means

05:42.610 --> 05:44.512
whoever got to you
got to you last night.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.079
So who was it, Frank?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.248
Lay off it, gum-scraper.
I'm warning you.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.017
Sorry, chum.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.019
You mess with the toilet,
you get the janitor.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.521
You won't help me? Then, fine.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.556
I'll catch
the rat bastard myself.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.127
CHARLIE:
The next day,
I hit the pavement

06:00.227 --> 06:02.430
looking for anybody
who had a problem with Frank.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.469
And, buddy, I found enough beef
to open a hamburger store.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.507
Trouble is, none of 'em
had seen Frank in days.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.209
So it all meant diddly.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.249
When it got dark,
I swung by Paddy's.

06:22.349 --> 06:26.253
Maybe the bad guy was hiding
at the bottom of a beer bottle.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.556
I should've swung my head
into a beehive.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.390
It would've been safer
than turning that corner.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.159
Leave me alone!

06:32.259 --> 06:34.161
You're making a big mistake.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.229
Hey! What's the matter, Joe?

06:36.263 --> 06:38.466
They don't teach you manners
at the School for Big Palookas?

06:38.566 --> 06:39.933
The lady said scram.

06:39.967 --> 06:43.003
You think you can clean up
this mess? Be my guest.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.673
I'm a janitor.
Cleaning up messes is what I do.

06:45.773 --> 06:49.309
Now dust, before I beat you
like an old rug.

06:49.342 --> 06:53.481
He sized me up.
But he didn't like the fit.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.982
Suit yourself.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.918
But you'll be back.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.821
They all come back.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.756
CHARLIE:
There, there, sweetheart.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.926
No use crying over smashed pie.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.363
Now, there was a dame
worth the cover charge.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.832
Her eyes glistened
in the moonlight

07:11.932 --> 07:13.667
like fresh gasoline puddles.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.036
They were the kind of eyes
you could fall in...

07:16.136 --> 07:18.038
and summer in.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.474
-And winter in, too.
-Sorry about that.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.975
My boyfriend looks
like a bad apple,

07:22.009 --> 07:25.979
but once you get to know Vince,
you'd like him even less.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.281
You're too nice a girl to be
playing with rotten apples.

07:28.315 --> 07:32.620
Well, my pies haven't
always been so sweet.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.488
But I'm trying
to turn that all around,

07:34.522 --> 07:36.223
make an honest living
selling home-baked goods.

07:36.323 --> 07:39.459
But he won't stand for it.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.195
Oh, gee,
there goes my rent money.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.732
Well, if you need
a place to stay...

07:44.832 --> 07:47.901
(chuckles)
You're a good man.

07:48.001 --> 07:51.505
I wouldn't want to drag you
into my troubles.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.841
I ain't the type that drags.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.375
I can see that.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.877
Find someplace safe.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.546
If he shows up again, call me.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.213
I'll straighten him out.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.182
Funny.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.852
You don't seem like
the straightening type.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.320
Maybe 'cause you got me
all twisted.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.498
(big band music playing)

08:18.532 --> 08:21.034
Say, fellas. What's the score?

08:21.134 --> 08:24.371
Frank hosed us. Turns out
this party's not for the bigwig.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.906
-It's for his daughter.
-He hosed us.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.642
Yeah, there's no booze,
no legal cooze.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.243
-Sounds like a snooze.
-(Dennis chuckles)

08:30.343 --> 08:31.579
-And there's barely any dudes.
-Don't add on.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.647
-There's a rhythm.
-Come on.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.515
Well, you must be pretty mad
at Frank.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.719
Oh, yeah. I hate his guts.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.220
Funny you should
mention his guts,

08:40.253 --> 08:42.489
considering Frank
got diarrhea-poisoned.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.823
In his guts.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.293
You two wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

08:46.393 --> 08:48.829
Can I get a Red 40?

08:48.862 --> 08:50.664
Yeah. Here's your Red 40, kid.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.566
DENNIS:
Look, uh,

08:52.666 --> 08:54.602
Charlie, I don't know what
"diarrhea-poisoned" means,

08:54.635 --> 08:57.037
but, uh, I certainly
didn't do it to Frank.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.874
Goddamn. Is that Dee?

09:00.974 --> 09:03.243
I told her to stay home
and watch Frank.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.645
What is she doing?

09:06.413 --> 09:07.748
CHARLIE:
Hang on, Dee.

09:07.848 --> 09:08.916
(grunting)

09:09.016 --> 09:11.084
(both shout)

09:11.184 --> 09:13.153
Cricket?
What are you doing here?

09:13.253 --> 09:15.623
Dee paid me to cover her shift,
hence the getup.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.857
Why were you in the basement?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.158
No reason.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.793
No reason, huh?

09:19.827 --> 09:20.894
I'll give you no reason.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.796
(shouts)
Yeah.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.164
More. Oh, yes. Do it.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.232
Harder. Yes.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.466
-(grunts)
-I'm a slut.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.301
-(both panting)
-All right.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.637
Frank let me stay.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.505
Frank let me sleep down there.
(gasps)

09:32.606 --> 09:33.774
I've been working for him.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.643
Doing what?

09:35.743 --> 09:37.410
He's running a cherry racket.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.746
A cherry racket?

09:38.846 --> 09:40.681
You telling me Frank's
running underage girls?

09:40.781 --> 09:41.949
I wouldn't put it past him,
but, no,

09:41.982 --> 09:43.751
that's not
what I'm talking about.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.585
I'm talking actual cherries.

09:45.686 --> 09:48.188
As in maraschino.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.090
Frank hired me to go down
to the local bars

09:50.190 --> 09:52.993
and stick my fingers
in the garnish stations.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.163
CHARLIE:
Why?

09:56.196 --> 09:57.497
Why, to contaminate
the cherries with feces,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.166
so people get sick, of course.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.501
-My God, that's disgusting.
-It's an honest living.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.703
Not really.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.604
Now, why is Frank trying
to contaminate cherries?

10:04.638 --> 10:06.106
Oh, I don't know.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.609
He flashed a roll of nickels,
and I didn't ask questions.

10:09.643 --> 10:12.145
When someone flashes a roll
of nickels at you,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.481
you don't ask questions,
you just do.

10:14.581 --> 10:17.450
No matter what they want
or where they want you to put it

10:17.484 --> 10:20.053
or where they want
to put into you...

10:20.153 --> 10:21.822
I'm gonna turn around now.

10:21.855 --> 10:25.158
I'd been looking at this
all wrong.

10:25.192 --> 10:28.061
It wasn't a poisoning.
It was a payback.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.562
All right, street rat,
I want to know

10:29.663 --> 10:31.665
which bars you hit
and when. Spill.

10:31.699 --> 10:35.335
Go kiss a duck.
You'll never make me talk.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.738
-I'm not slapping you
around again.
-(sighs)

10:37.838 --> 10:40.507
All right, fine, just get me
a pen and I'll write 'em down.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.747
(exhales)

10:49.049 --> 10:51.852
CHARLIE:
So Cricket had contaminated
the wrong guy's cherries

10:51.952 --> 10:55.522
and now Frank was dancing
the porcelain rumba.

10:55.622 --> 10:58.658
And I was still in the dark.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.161
And there's only two things
you can do in the dark:

11:01.194 --> 11:02.963
you can drink...

11:02.996 --> 11:05.198
and you can hide.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.503
If you came to shoot me,

11:10.537 --> 11:12.873
at least let me finish
my drink first.

11:12.973 --> 11:16.910
I'm not gonna shoot you.
What if I missed?

11:17.010 --> 11:20.547
Well, then you'd have to say
you missed me.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.515
Maybe I did.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.517
Maybe I missed you, too.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.419
Well, you'd better work
on your aim.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.521
Sure, I could do that,

11:28.621 --> 11:32.492
-but I'm better at close range.
-Yes, you are.

11:32.525 --> 11:36.196
-Can I fix you a drink?
-No, thanks. I'm sober.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.065
Plus, I saw you
put cat food in it.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.667
(chuckles)
Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.903
-You did, Charlie, I saw you
scoop it out of the can...
-I put a little bit in.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.572
...and it smells so bad.
You're so close to me with that.

11:45.672 --> 11:48.408
-All right, I'll put it down.
-God.

11:48.508 --> 11:49.777
So what you doing here, doll?

11:49.810 --> 11:51.478
I told you to find
someplace safe.

11:51.578 --> 11:54.848
The only safe place for me...

11:54.882 --> 11:57.217
is in your arms.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.352
Oh, sure, my arms are safe.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.289
It's my lips
you have to watch out for.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.657
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.193
Unless, wait,
a-are you telling me

12:06.226 --> 12:07.594
you have a cold sore
or something?

12:07.627 --> 12:09.229
-'Cause I'm not good with that.
-Oh, no, we're good.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.463
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.498
Okay.

12:23.676 --> 12:24.644
(grunts softly)

12:24.677 --> 12:26.613
Morning, dollface.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.148
-(shouts)
-(camera clicks)

12:28.248 --> 12:30.317
Goddamn it.
Why are you smiling?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.852
Well, I'm trying to look sexy.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.822
-You're supposed to be dead.
-I know. I can be dead and sexy.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.990
You're not supposed to be sexy.
You're supposed to be the goon.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.992
No, I'm not the goon.
I don't want to be the goon.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.994
-I want to be something better.
-But you are the goon.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.963
-I'm not the goddamn goon.
-You're the goon, Dee.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.264
Who else is the goon?
You're the goon.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.033
How could I be a goon?
I'm wearing a nightie.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.035
-You're a goon in a nightie.
-Maybe that's
your murder weapon.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.470
-Take it off and you strangle...
-Goddamn it. All right,
I'm out of here.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.940
All right. Goodbye, goon.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.774
So what's the big idea
here, fellas?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.476
Ah, Frank sent us here
to blackmail you,

12:56.576 --> 12:58.778
so you stop sticking your nose
in where it don't belong.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.613
Ah, so you're in on
Frank's cherry scheme?

13:00.647 --> 13:01.949
Yeah, it's easy money.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.650
After Cricket
fondles the cherries,

13:03.750 --> 13:05.152
the bars trash
their whole supply

13:05.252 --> 13:07.020
thinking they're
all contaminated.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.690
Mac and I rescue
the perfectly good cherries,

13:10.790 --> 13:15.495
and Frank resells them to the
bars for a neat little markup.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.498
He gives us 30%,
only Mac thinks it's ten.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.167
-What?
-Shut up!

13:20.267 --> 13:21.869
Come on.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.536
Say, you two fellas
know anything

13:23.636 --> 13:25.038
about a guy named Vince?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.640
Hangs around The Waitress
like a bad cheese burp?

13:27.674 --> 13:29.709
Yeah, we know him.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.579
Runs with a crew out of a church
on South Street,

13:32.679 --> 13:34.882
only he ain't the praying type.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.216
Tell him I want to meet.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.318
Yeah.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.390
You talking to me?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.325
Yeah.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.295
Well, I can't tell
'cause I'm not looking at you.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.497
We ain't looking at you either.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.001
Are you still here?

13:54.101 --> 13:56.036
-No, we're gonna go now.
-We're leaving now, though.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.505
That's for the best.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.341
MAC:
Hey, is it, is it ten percent
or is it really 30%?

14:01.441 --> 14:02.842
DENNIS:
It's whatever I say it is.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.477
CHARLIE:
Well, that about sewed it up.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.014
Too bad I have a habit
of pulling at loose threads.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.549
The doc says that's why
my sutures don't heal good.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.850
So I called up Frank.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.485
He told me to meet him
at Paddy's

14:12.519 --> 14:13.987
and he would explain
everything.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.723
Yeah, like a brick would
explain gravity to my head.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.061
-Frank?
-(Frank grunting)

14:21.161 --> 14:23.263
Cricket?

14:23.296 --> 14:25.432
No johns in the basement, pal.

14:27.834 --> 14:28.936
Frank!

14:30.938 --> 14:32.405
(groaning)

14:32.505 --> 14:34.474
My guts are cut to ribbons.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.409
-What? Who did this to you?
-I did.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.645
I was carrying a jar
of cherries, I fell on them,

14:38.745 --> 14:42.015
they bust, they sliced
my stomach to bits.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.051
I'm no matador, Frank,
so you can cut the bull.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.652
I know all about
your cherry scam.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.987
My cherry scam?

14:47.087 --> 14:50.890
Oh, Charlie,
you sweet innocent dope.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.993
I'm not the top of this sundae.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.162
This goes all the way
to city hall.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.997
It all started
when I bribed some bigwig

14:57.097 --> 14:58.898
from the Board of Health
to ban Red 40,

14:58.999 --> 15:03.136
the dye used
in maraschino cherries.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.905
-CHARLIE: Red 40?
-FRANK: I used the guys

15:06.006 --> 15:08.475
to round up all the cherries,
and then I sat on them

15:08.575 --> 15:11.979
for a couple of months, and then
resold them back to the same bar

15:12.012 --> 15:14.314
for jacked-up
black market prices,

15:14.347 --> 15:17.317
but there was a snag
in the plan.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.785
The bars wouldn't bite.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.653
Turns out, their customers
didn't give a shit

15:20.753 --> 15:23.156
about the cherries,
so we had to find other buyers

15:23.256 --> 15:26.526
who'd pay through the nose
for their maraschino fix.

15:26.626 --> 15:30.697
Old folks homes for
pineapple upside-down cake,

15:30.797 --> 15:33.366
teenage birthday parties,

15:33.466 --> 15:35.168
and teetotalers

15:35.202 --> 15:38.638
who only drink Shirley Temples.

15:38.738 --> 15:39.973
-(coughs)
-All right, enough talk, Franky.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.674
Save your story for St. Peter.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.376
All I want to know
is who poisoned you?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.478
I tried to protect you, Charlie,

15:45.512 --> 15:48.181
but this mess is too big
for your mop.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.650
-I'm not the bad guy here.
It's...
-Who is it?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.452
Who is it?

16:05.232 --> 16:06.733
Where is she?

16:06.833 --> 16:10.337
(groans) Man.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.805
-Where is who?
-The girl.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.407
She belongs with me.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.976
Well, she's a jewel.
She belongs in a crown.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.678
You belong in bracelets.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.813
You're trying to provoke me.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.519
But I know how
to control myself.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.323
Red 40.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.160
Okay, Vince,
I'll take you to the girl.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.796
But first, let me fix a drink.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.066
VINCE:
You seem like a smart cookie.
I think you'd do well

16:39.166 --> 16:41.468
in our organization.
You should join us.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.002
And if I refuse?

16:43.036 --> 16:45.505
Well...

16:45.538 --> 16:48.007
that could be bad
for your health.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.177
Well, how about
I drop by a meeting?

16:50.210 --> 16:51.344
Sounds like a gas.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.680
VINCE:
What is...?

16:53.713 --> 16:55.748
(coughing):
What-what is that?

16:55.848 --> 16:59.052
Ammonia-bleach cocktail,
aka the Janitor's Helper.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.453
Luckily, I'm immune.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.456
I've built up a healthy
tolerance over the years,

17:03.556 --> 17:06.559
or unhealthy, depending
on how you look at it.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.597
(exhales)

17:14.800 --> 17:15.935
Huh.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.142
(door opens)

17:22.242 --> 17:23.976
-THE WAITRESS: (gasps) Charlie!
-(door closes)

17:24.077 --> 17:26.246
Thank God you're all right.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.248
I am, but Vince isn't.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.117
He's gonna wake up with his head
pounding harder

17:30.150 --> 17:32.485
than a Chinese crossword puzzle.

17:32.585 --> 17:33.720
Huh?

17:33.820 --> 17:36.323
Was that--
That one wasn't clear?

17:36.423 --> 17:38.491
-No.
-All right, I'm running out
of them, you know, it's...

17:38.591 --> 17:40.393
But the point is
I took care of him.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.895
-My hero.
-Yeah.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.997
I guess my pies
are finally safe.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.799
Well, not from me.
Hand me a spoon.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.000
(chuckles)

17:49.836 --> 17:51.304
Say,

17:51.404 --> 17:53.506
why didn't you tell me
about Frank's cherry racket?

17:53.606 --> 17:55.475
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.077
Yes, you do. You were helping
him sell the illegal cherries.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.980
-You connected him with Vince.
-Well, I...

18:01.080 --> 18:03.350
I guess I didn't want you to
think of me as a petty criminal.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.852
There's nothing petty
about you, is there, baby?

18:05.952 --> 18:08.355
-(The Waitress chuckles)
-(stomach gurgling)
-Ooh.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.659
-Oh.
-(laughs)

18:14.527 --> 18:15.995
You idiot.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.299
I didn't tell you
because it's my cherry racket.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.034
Frank didn't know what he had.
I'm the one

18:22.135 --> 18:24.137
who figured out those cherries
had fermented from sitting

18:24.237 --> 18:26.539
in those vats for months. Yeah.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.942
They had turned into a
slam-bang booze for the ages,

18:29.976 --> 18:31.544
and we could
charge triple in places

18:31.644 --> 18:33.813
where hooch was badly wanted
but not allowed.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.050
Old folks homes,

18:38.151 --> 18:40.953
Sweet 16 parties,

18:40.987 --> 18:43.156
court-ordered rehab centers.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.360
It was like
shooting fish in a...

18:47.460 --> 18:49.696
Charlie, are you still
eating that pie? I poisoned it.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.564
-You did?
-Yeah, that's what
I'm telling you.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.500
Oh, yeah. (clears throat)
You know what?

18:53.533 --> 18:55.568
There's a lot of threads
going around; I'm losing track.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.004
-Okay, I poisoned the pie.
-Yeah.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.972
-So you should stop eating it.
-Right.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.874
-There you go.
-It's good.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.043
-Thanks. Appreciate that.
-Last bite.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.213
-Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.
-And carry on.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.116
-What about Frank?
-I poisoned Frank, too.

19:10.149 --> 19:14.153
He figured out what I was up to
and he wanted out,

19:14.187 --> 19:16.055
but we were making
too much money,

19:16.155 --> 19:18.991
so I diarrhea poisoned him
to shut him up.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.994
Aah!
(groaning loudly)

19:22.094 --> 19:24.964
THE WAITRESS:
He got the message in the end.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.999
(burps)
And Vince?

19:27.033 --> 19:29.836
Oh, Vince caught me smuggling
boozy pies into A.A.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.205
and threatened to rat me out
to my parole officer.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.040
You see, he wasn't actually
my boyfriend.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.708
He was my sponsor,

19:35.808 --> 19:38.711
and he was a real buzzkill,
literally.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.079
But why poison me?

19:40.179 --> 19:43.015
Well, you were getting
too close.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.752
Or maybe I was.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.988
Either way,
I'm leaving town tonight and,

19:49.021 --> 19:51.157
well, I can't have you
following me.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.960
Well, you're not gonna
get away with it.

19:54.060 --> 19:57.163
Oh, yeah?
And who's gonna stop me?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.898
I am.

19:58.998 --> 20:02.769
See, I knew you were lying
when I found Vince's A.A. chip.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.671
-(gasps)
-You used me.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.506
You used me like you used Frank.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.841
And I knew
it was only a matter of time

20:08.875 --> 20:10.443
before you tried
to poison me, too.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.313
So that's why
that shot I took wasn't vodka.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.147
-It was bleach.
-What?

20:15.248 --> 20:17.317
-The universal poison antidote.
-No, it's not.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.820
-It's not?
-I mean, if anything,
you've ingested more poison.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.190
No, you put bleach on poison, it
cancels it out, I'm pretty sure.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.658
-No, it makes the poison
more poisoning.
-No.

20:25.758 --> 20:26.793
The two things cancel--

20:26.893 --> 20:27.960
No, you're right.
Here come the cherries.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.429
-(groans)
-(screams)

20:29.462 --> 20:30.763
Oh, God!

20:30.797 --> 20:31.964
-Jesus Christ, Charlie!
-(coughs)

20:31.998 --> 20:34.133
Either way, you're done,
baby doll.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.603
I called the cops
to take you downtown.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.104
-Oh.
-Ha ha!

20:38.137 --> 20:40.106
The gig's up, you ugly dame.

20:40.139 --> 20:41.574
You're under arrest.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.443
-You come with me.
-What the hell?

20:43.476 --> 20:45.011
I was undercover the whole time.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.646
I mean,
what are you talking about?

20:46.679 --> 20:48.848
-That doesn't even make sense.
-Yeah, I switched things up.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.517
Got tired of being called
a goon. Let's go!

20:50.617 --> 20:51.984
-Ow!
-You're out of here!

20:52.018 --> 20:53.320
-You're really hurting my arm.
-Yeah, that's okay with me.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.821
-This is so stupid!
Let go of me!
-All right.

20:54.854 --> 20:55.988
-No, I'm not gonna
let go of you.
-(mutters)

20:56.088 --> 20:57.189
I got one job to do,
I'm gonna finish it.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.358
-Let's go. Yeah.
-Ow!

20:58.458 --> 20:59.659
-Yeah, well...
-Ow! That hurts!

20:59.692 --> 21:01.828
Yeah, that's all right.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.196
CHARLIE:
Well, this is where
you came in.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.766
Only now, you know
the whole sticky situation.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.369
It's not every day that
a janitor makes his own mess,

21:09.469 --> 21:11.704
but when he does-- ooh, boy.

21:11.804 --> 21:15.308
Now I'm about to shit my brains
all over this floor.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.976
But don't worry.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.646
I'll mop twice.
I always do.

22:41.394 --> 22:45.064
But the one time I tried it,
I looked so much like my mom,
it scared me.

22:45.097 --> 22:46.733
And I was sexy as hell.
