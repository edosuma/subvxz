Uh, when the crime rate
goes down,

uh, that basically means
we'’re-- we're doin'’ a good job

01:03.482 --> 01:06.931

-We rammed him

04:25.275 --> 04:26.965
We hit him
on the driver'’s side rear.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.275
He spun out a little bit,
but kept goin'’.
-That'’s what caused the bumper?

a flat tire, that'’s
about it, though.

were gonna lose it

come up, '’cause we could just

04:37.000 --> 04:38.827
feel the rear end,
just givin'’ out, you know
what I mean?

04:38.862 --> 04:40.862
-Givin'’ out? Yeah. Yeah.
He couldn'’t get around this,

uh, couldn'’t get around
this semi right here?

04:43.137 --> 04:44.758
-So you hit him?
-So what I did was,

04:44.793 --> 04:47.103
he-- he slowed down
just a little bit, and I
found a chance to pit him out,

04:47.137 --> 04:49.310
and I pitted him out.
-Good for you, man.
Good job. You okay?

Why are you drivin'’ it?
-All right, I'’m drivin' it,

05:01.689 --> 05:03.517
'’cause, uh, we had got in
an argument, so I was just,

05:03.551 --> 05:05.482
like, oh, I'’m takin' the car,
I'’m gonna go for a drive.

05:05.517 --> 05:07.241
Well, what'’s the argument about?
-One of the reasons

05:07.275 --> 05:09.275
we got in an argument
'’cause, it's, like, we didn'’t--

05:09.310 --> 05:11.172
we didn'’t agree on things.
Like, certain things, like,

05:11.206 --> 05:15.241
her, like, takin'’ away my son.
Like, it was just-- it just
got into-- it just, like,

05:15.275 --> 05:17.379
real personal.
-Was there anyone
in the car

05:17.413 --> 05:19.517
when you drove off in it?
-No, sir.

05:19.551 --> 05:22.241
I didn'’t-- like, I didn't make--
I didn'’t try, like, to make
a big scene, '’cause

05:22.275 --> 05:24.724
I was like-- you know?
-Okay, did you know
this is her car?

-I freaked out, I just panicked,
you know?

05:30.448 --> 05:33.655
I thought I was-- like--
I'’m-- when-- when I get--

05:33.689 --> 05:35.551
like, when I make--
when I'’m, like, in a panic,

05:35.586 --> 05:37.137
I'’m known
to make bad decisions.

05:37.172 --> 05:39.862
I panicked, you know,
it'’s just, like, [bleep],
what am I gonna do?

05:39.896 --> 05:42.551
Like, I shoulda stopped.
I shoulda stopped,
but I didn'’t stop.

05:42.586 --> 05:45.275
-Did you feel us hit you,
way back in the city?

05:45.310 --> 05:47.931

-No, I was-- I was just--
the adrenaline was goin'’,

05:47.965 --> 05:50.344
I didn'’t feel nothin'.
I was just panicked.
-Okay. And then--

05:50.379 --> 05:52.103
what were you thinkin'’
right here when you got hit?

05:52.137 --> 05:55.413
-Here I thought I was gonna
flip over, '’cause I see
my whole back end go over,

05:55.448 --> 05:58.241
uh, go-- went over
the truck, I said,
oh, [bleep], man, [bleep].

05:58.275 --> 05:59.724
-And then,
did you run on foot?

05:59.758 --> 06:01.413
-And then, when I got
out the car, I said--

06:01.448 --> 06:03.103
I got out the car,
ran around the car, like,

06:03.137 --> 06:05.413
a lot, '’cause, you know, I mean,
I was stuck, and my ears
were ringin'’,

06:05.448 --> 06:07.000
and I see him with the gun--
I see--

06:07.034 --> 06:09.000
-He'’s not here anymore,
I know who you'’re talkin' about.

06:09.034 --> 06:11.620
-Yeah-- Yeah-- Yeah, he came
with the gun, he pointed it
at me, I said,

06:11.655 --> 06:13.896
oh, [bleep], like, don'’t shoot.
I mean, I don'’t want no harm
no more.

06:13.931 --> 06:15.413
You feel me?
Like, I'’m good, you feel me?

06:15.448 --> 06:16.931
I just gave up, I'’m, like,
I can'’t do nothin'.

06:16.965 --> 06:18.827
-You know how many stop signs
you ran?

06:18.862 --> 06:20.103
How many red lights
you ran?

06:20.137 --> 06:22.965
-Okay, honestly, I--
-How many people
you endangered?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.620
-I know, I endangered
a lot of people.
-Okay.

06:24.655 --> 06:27.413
-I know I ran, uh, a lot more
stop signs than I did lights,
though. [laughs]

06:27.448 --> 06:28.896
-I'’ll give it to you,
I mean, you can drive.

06:28.931 --> 06:32.724
-I mean-- I mean, I-- I'’m--
that'’s not the--

06:32.758 --> 06:35.413
I was hoping it would help me
get away, but hell no, man.

06:35.448 --> 06:37.379
-You asked if baby mama
can get the car?

06:37.413 --> 06:38.620
Did you see the car?

06:38.655 --> 06:40.655
-Yeah.
-Your front wheel'’s

-That'’s another thing,
like, now she can'’t get home.

06:45.068 --> 06:48.586
-Okay, so right now
the charges are gonna be
carjacking, evading arrest,

06:48.620 --> 06:51.137
which is gonna be a felony
because of the reckless driving,

06:51.172 --> 06:54.482
and then resisting arrest
for running when you got
out of the car, okay?

06:56.655 --> 06:59.275

Police Department since '’08.

09:06.034 --> 09:08.551
You-- You weren'’t over there?
'’Cause you're lyin'’ to me.

09:08.586 --> 09:10.344
-I stopped right here.

09:10.379 --> 09:12.172
-You dropped somethin'’, then,
if that'’s the case.

09:12.206 --> 09:14.310
-[indistinct] drop [bleep].
-Okay. We'’ll see.

09:14.344 --> 09:16.000
-Didn'’t drop nothin'.
-All right.

09:17.655 --> 09:20.586
-Wipe my face for me.
-No.

09:20.620 --> 09:23.000
You did that to yourself, man.

09:23.034 --> 09:25.275
All right,
so why did you run?

09:25.310 --> 09:27.137
-I don'’t know.
-You don'’t know?

09:27.172 --> 09:28.413
All right.

09:30.068 --> 09:31.137
-What'’s up, guy?

09:31.172 --> 09:32.758
-[indistinct]

09:34.275 --> 09:35.758
-[laughs]

09:35.793 --> 09:37.931
-[indistinct]
-[indistinct]

09:37.965 --> 09:40.034
-All right, I'’m gonna
go help, uh, Dustin

09:40.068 --> 09:41.724
track, uh, where he ran.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.206
-I don'’t know if they're--
if they'’re anything,
two little pills.

09:46.241 --> 09:48.931
-Okay.
-He left '’em in there
if you wanna find out

09:48.965 --> 09:52.379
what they are.
Didn'’t take 'em out.

09:52.413 --> 09:55.862
-I just hope it wasn'’t a duck,
but a passenger.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.172
-[radio chatter]

10:00.517 --> 10:02.586
-See if they have
any scorings, okay.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.862
200 and a capsule.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.862
R-40... okay.

10:06.896 --> 10:09.517
-[radio chatter]

10:12.000 --> 10:15.344
-Went ahead and identified
one of the two pills that were
in the cup holder.

10:15.379 --> 10:17.965
Looks like it might be,
uh, Ritalin.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.413
So, uh... very least,
the driver, who ran from us,

10:21.448 --> 10:25.655
is gonna go ahead
and get charged
with a Schedule II narcotic.

10:25.689 --> 10:27.620
You can stand up, my man.

10:27.655 --> 10:29.206
Corporal Ryder with Lafayette
Police Department.

10:29.241 --> 10:31.034
I'’m-- I'm the one
who conducted
the traffic stop.

10:31.068 --> 10:32.862
I saw you were
the front passenger, okay?
-Okay.

10:32.896 --> 10:35.793
As far as you know,
is that his vehicle?
-Yes, sir.

10:35.827 --> 10:40.310
-Okay.
Is there any reason why
you, uh, believe he ran

10:40.344 --> 10:42.862
from the police officers?
-No, sir.
Not at all.

10:42.896 --> 10:46.620
-But one of the pills I found
identified as a Schedule II.

10:46.655 --> 10:48.965
I'’m gonna put you
in the report, but at this time,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.344
I'’m not gonna charge you
with it.

10:50.379 --> 10:52.689
Uh, I'’m just gonna put
that you got picked up
on that.

10:52.724 --> 10:55.379
Uh, if the stories do change,
and we go to court on this,

10:55.413 --> 10:58.103
you'’ll be goin' to court.
Do you have any questions
for me?

10:58.137 --> 11:00.344
-No, sir.
-All right, man.
Be careful.

11:00.379 --> 11:02.413
-Okay.
-All right.
You'’re free to go.

11:06.034 --> 11:10.275
All right, Dennis?
I pulled you over
in who'’s vehicle?

11:10.310 --> 11:12.172
-In my girl.
-Your girl'’s vehicle?

11:12.206 --> 11:14.448
Okay. So...
why did you run from me?

11:14.482 --> 11:16.275
Are you high right now?
-I don'’t even know why I ran.

11:16.310 --> 11:21.103
I guess... no driver'’s license.
-Mm-hm. Okay.

11:21.137 --> 11:23.931
So, so you never had
a driver'’s license
or it'’s suspended?

11:23.965 --> 11:26.482
Uh, I never had
a driver'’s license.

11:26.517 --> 11:28.137
Okay, I appreciate your honesty.

11:28.172 --> 11:32.034
Okay, so, um, any other reason
why you ran from me?

11:32.068 --> 11:34.206
And there'’s a reason
why I'’m askin' you.

11:34.241 --> 11:39.206
No, sir.
Oh... I did have, like,
two medi-- like, medicines

11:39.241 --> 11:43.482
for my pet
that I was gonna give,
that was in the, uh...

11:43.517 --> 11:45.862
in the cup holder in--
-Okay.

11:45.896 --> 11:48.000
And I-- And I found '’em,
and I appreciate that.

11:48.034 --> 11:51.896
-I know, uh...
it'’s not nothin' like--
-What is it?

11:51.931 --> 11:54.586
-It'’s just my pet likes speed.
-Speed?

11:54.620 --> 11:56.310
-And one of '’em is,
like, to focus.

11:56.344 --> 11:57.413
-To focus?
-Yes, sir.

11:57.448 --> 11:59.413
-Okay.
-Just usin'’ it for our pets.

11:59.448 --> 12:01.241
-Pets?
You feed it to your pets?

12:01.275 --> 12:02.793
So you don'’t take it?
You feed it to your pets?

12:02.827 --> 12:04.482
-No, no, man,
I don'’t take that.

12:04.517 --> 12:08.586
-You know what one of those
are for? One of those
is speed, Schedule II.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.103
-Well, I don'’t know
what that [bleep] is.

12:10.137 --> 12:12.931
-Okay.
So... you'’re gonna
get those two traffic tickets,

12:12.965 --> 12:15.344
a failure to signal turn,
and failure to, uh,

12:15.379 --> 12:16.620
secure a driver'’s license.

12:16.655 --> 12:20.758
Okay?
And the resisting.
And the Schedule II, okay?

12:20.793 --> 12:22.862
-Them pills are,
whatever, you know?
-Yeah.

12:22.896 --> 12:25.620
-That'’s, like, all--
they got their own
little thing for it,

12:25.655 --> 12:28.413
I ain'’t-- I don't--
-I understand, but you'’re
telling me

12:28.448 --> 12:30.620
what I should put
in my report is you-- you
feed it to the chickens

12:30.655 --> 12:32.241
to hype '’em up?
-Yeah, that'’s the--

12:32.275 --> 12:33.517
-You do-- Ya'’ll do
some cockfightin'’?

12:33.551 --> 12:35.827
-No. We'’re raisin'.
-Oh, you raise '’em.

12:35.862 --> 12:37.241
-Yeah.
So when they come out pretty,

12:37.275 --> 12:38.758
make sure they'’re healthy,
you know?

12:38.793 --> 12:40.689
-Okay.
-They'’re game chickens.

12:40.724 --> 12:43.379
-So-- So, some good eatin'’?
-Yeah, some of '’em.

12:43.413 --> 12:45.034
-Oh, okay.
So do you fight '’em?

12:45.068 --> 12:47.896
-The ones that don'’t
come out too, you know,
too pretty, no, they--

12:47.931 --> 12:49.620
Might put '’em in a gumbo.
-So do you fight '’em?

12:49.655 --> 12:52.758
-No, I raise chicks.
-Rx chicken?

12:52.793 --> 12:55.896
-I just make '’em look pretty,
and get rid of--
-[laughs]

12:55.931 --> 12:57.620
-I like the pretty-- that'’s me.
-And then sell '’em?

12:57.655 --> 12:59.206
-Like the white ones
and stuff?
-Okay.

12:59.241 --> 13:00.931
Let me just
get all your information down,

13:00.965 --> 13:03.206
and then, uh,
we'’re gonna go ahead
and book you in.

13:05.689 --> 13:09.103
-Out in this job
you have to be able
to communicate effectively

13:09.137 --> 13:11.862
with all sorts
of different types
of individuals.

13:11.896 --> 13:14.034
I have a background
in customer service

13:14.068 --> 13:16.000
working concierge
up on the Strip.

13:16.034 --> 13:17.793
I'’m able to apply that
out here on the street,

13:17.827 --> 13:20.000
and treat everyone
with that respect,

13:20.034 --> 13:21.448
but also show them
that, yeah,

13:21.482 --> 13:23.241
we are trained
law enforcement officers,

13:23.275 --> 13:25.000
but at the same time,
police officers

13:25.034 --> 13:28.896
are normal people
and have a normal life.

13:28.931 --> 13:31.172
-[radio chatter]

13:31.206 --> 13:33.758
-Just got dispatched
to a domestic disturbance.

13:33.793 --> 13:38.310
Detail said that a, uh,
white male pointed a gun
at a female.

13:38.344 --> 13:40.724
We'’re gonna attempt
to locate this male
inside the neighborhood

13:40.758 --> 13:43.310
that he was last seen at.

13:43.344 --> 13:47.586
-[radio chatter]
-The, uh, blue vehicle
from earlier, he'’s back

13:47.620 --> 13:51.310
at his residence,
uh, just saw us,
and is shutting the garage.

13:51.344 --> 13:54.379
Could we get another unit
to go meet with the victim,

13:54.413 --> 13:58.206
and see if this is actually
gonna be the suspect?

13:58.241 --> 13:59.793
And control, I'’ll need
another unit with me,

13:59.827 --> 14:02.034
'’cause, uh, he saw us
and shut the garage.

14:02.068 --> 14:04.517
And this one'’s good
for AWDW.

14:08.137 --> 14:09.862
-[radio chatter]
-You live at this house?

14:09.896 --> 14:12.344
-Yes, and I wanna know
what was said.

14:12.379 --> 14:14.793
-Okay.
Go stand over at my patrol car.

14:14.827 --> 14:16.862
-No, because you'’re not
gonna come in with guns blazing

14:16.896 --> 14:19.241
on my boyfriend for no reason.
He didn'’t do anything wrong.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.724
-Okay. Will you, uh, will you
step over here, please?

14:21.758 --> 14:23.689
-For what?
-'’Cause if he comes out
with his gun--

14:23.724 --> 14:26.000
-He'’s not, though!
Let me go in and I will
bring him out,

14:26.034 --> 14:28.724
I just told him you were here.
-Shhh! Shhh! Stop.

14:28.758 --> 14:31.206
Come here.
You'’re not gonna
call anybody, okay?

14:31.241 --> 14:32.793
-Exactly.
Holster your gun.

14:32.827 --> 14:35.275
You [bleep] cops
wanna shoot everybody.

14:35.310 --> 14:37.758
That'’s fine.
I'’m not under arrest,

14:37.793 --> 14:40.172
I don'’t know why you think
you need to handcuff me.

14:40.206 --> 14:42.586
-'’Cause you're not
being cooperative.
-I am! You'’re sitting here

14:42.620 --> 14:45.034
with your gun blazing
-Because I'’m by my--

14:45.068 --> 14:46.448
-and you won'’t tell me
what happened.
-Stop.

14:46.482 --> 14:47.827
Here'’s the deal, okay, Miss?

14:47.862 --> 14:49.379
Your boyfriend'’s involved
in a scuffle earlier.

14:49.413 --> 14:51.241
The neighbor, uh, she had
a gun pointed at her,

14:51.275 --> 14:54.586
and it'’s
your boyfriend who'’s...
-He has a license for it.

14:54.620 --> 14:58.000
-Just because you have
a license for a gun--
-She-- He told her to get back,

14:58.034 --> 15:00.034
she-- she came running at her.
-Just because you have-- stop.

15:00.068 --> 15:01.862
Do you have your phone
on you, so we can call him out,

15:01.896 --> 15:04.000
so we don'’t have to send
a K-9 dog?

15:04.034 --> 15:05.413
Where'’s it at?
Where'’s your phone at?

15:05.448 --> 15:06.586
I'’m not gonna
unhandcuff you.

15:06.620 --> 15:07.965
-...and I have a lock on it.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.344
-Okay, well, where'’s
your phone at?

15:09.379 --> 15:11.103
-My phone'’s
in my back pocket.
-Can I grab it?

15:11.137 --> 15:12.482
-That'’s fine.

15:14.827 --> 15:15.862
-Is that him?
-Yes.

15:15.896 --> 15:17.241
-Andrew?
-Yes, push the call button.

15:17.275 --> 15:20.068
-[phone beeps and rings]

15:20.103 --> 15:23.275
-Hello?
-Hey, Andrew,
how are you, man?

15:23.310 --> 15:26.482
-Good, how are you?
-Hey, I'’m doin' fine.
It'’s Officer Pascoe at Metro.

15:26.517 --> 15:28.379
Um, I'’d like you
to come outside of your house

15:28.413 --> 15:30.137
so we can get this story
figured out.

15:30.172 --> 15:32.241
-Yeah, I was just in here
tryin'’ to calm down my daughter.

15:32.275 --> 15:34.068
Very cool.
You have a weapon, right?

15:34.103 --> 15:37.103
-That I do, yes.
-If you can do me a favor,
go to the back bedroom,

15:37.137 --> 15:39.517
unload that gun,
and then leave it back there.

15:39.551 --> 15:41.655
And then come outside
and just show us
your hands?

15:41.689 --> 15:44.758
We'’ll give you some
verbal commands, and then
we'’ll talk to you, okay?

15:44.793 --> 15:47.758
-Yeah, yeah, no problem.
-Okay. Thank you.

15:47.793 --> 15:49.275
See? It'’s as easy
as that, right?

15:49.310 --> 15:51.241
-Yeah, but you'’re listening
to some [bleep]...
-It'’s the unknown,

15:51.275 --> 15:53.034
and I have to.
I have to, '’cause guess what,

15:53.068 --> 15:56.103
I'’m goin' home at night, okay?
And I'’m takin' zero--
zero chances.

15:58.275 --> 15:59.965
-Yeah, but who cares
who else goes home, right?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.793
-Turn around!
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!

16:01.827 --> 16:03.379
-[indistinct]

16:03.413 --> 16:06.034
-Put your hands
on top of your head for me.

16:06.068 --> 16:07.655
-Didn'’t I tell you
to put it in the back bedroom

16:07.689 --> 16:09.448
and remove the source
of ammunition?

16:09.482 --> 16:11.275
-Oh, I'’m sorry, I thought
you meant put the ammunition

16:11.310 --> 16:12.896
and the clip and everything
in the back room...

16:12.931 --> 16:15.551
-No no no no, and I said
leave it back there.

16:15.586 --> 16:17.344
-I-- I apologize.

16:17.379 --> 16:19.103
-Tell me what happened
earlier today.

16:19.137 --> 16:23.137
-I had started arguing
with my girlfriend-- I mean
my ex-girlfriend,

16:23.172 --> 16:24.379
in front of the house.
-With Nicole?

16:24.413 --> 16:25.689
-With Nicole.
-Okay.

16:25.724 --> 16:27.448
-And then one of her friends
had came out from upstairs,

16:27.482 --> 16:31.103
and she starts yelling at me,
and she tells us
to shut the F up.

16:31.137 --> 16:33.689
So then I yelled at her,
and I told her mind
your own business.

16:33.724 --> 16:35.862
She said, mind my own business,
she starts coming
down the stairs,

16:35.896 --> 16:38.448
she balls her fist up.
So I'’m like, what are you
gonna do, have your boyfriend

16:38.482 --> 16:39.758
come out here
and do something?

16:39.793 --> 16:42.034
She said, yeah, I-- I'’m on
the phone with him right now.

16:42.068 --> 16:45.137
So I walked over
to my car, I pulled-- I did
pull my gun out,

16:45.172 --> 16:47.344
-Okay.
-And I-- I-- I held it
in my hand, and I said,

16:47.379 --> 16:50.793
don'’t come near me.
I was like, stay away from me,
I don'’t-- you know what I mean,

16:50.827 --> 16:54.448
don'’t come near me.
And then she backed away,
she went upstairs,

16:54.482 --> 16:56.551
um, I got back in my car,
and I left.

16:56.586 --> 17:00.103
-Did she have a weapon?
-Well, no, I just felt like
my life was threatened--

17:00.137 --> 17:01.482
-Okay.
-I-- I didn'’t want any problems.

17:01.517 --> 17:04.034
-When you took your CCW course,
what did they tell you

17:04.068 --> 17:06.103
that was for?
Your firearm?

17:06.137 --> 17:07.862
-I haven'’t taken a--
I don'’t have the--
I don'’t have

17:07.896 --> 17:10.344
the concealed weapons permit.
-Okay. Well, I-- I know

17:10.379 --> 17:12.586
that'’s not what a firearm
is used for.

17:12.620 --> 17:14.379
It'’s not for an argument.

17:14.413 --> 17:17.482
At any point,
did you ever think, okay,
maybe I could get in my car

17:17.517 --> 17:20.896
and just drive away?
-Well, that'’s basically
what I did.

17:20.931 --> 17:22.172
-Let me talk with, uh,
with Candace.

17:22.206 --> 17:24.586
Just go stand
at this second vehicle
over here, okay?

17:24.620 --> 17:27.275
-[dog barking]
-Hey, Candace?

17:27.310 --> 17:30.000
-Yeah?
-Can you come here, real quick?

17:30.034 --> 17:31.827
-Sorry, I just
got outta the shower.
-Hey, that'’s okay.

17:31.862 --> 17:34.206
Hey, uh, do you wanna--
do you have some flipflops or--

17:34.241 --> 17:36.068
you know, it'’s okay.
Anybody else inside the house
or no?

17:36.103 --> 17:37.310
-No.
It'’s me and my baby.

17:37.344 --> 17:39.137
-Okay.
Um, real quick, I just
need you to go back

17:39.172 --> 17:41.448
through the details,
what exactly happened.

17:41.482 --> 17:44.724
-Oh, I was-- I was laying
in this room, and I just
hear a lot of arguing,

17:44.758 --> 17:47.862
so I came outside,
and I see it'’s Andrew
and Nicole--

17:47.896 --> 17:50.068
-And they'’re back here
in the parking lot?
-No, they'’re right here.

17:50.103 --> 17:53.000
-They'’re right here?
-And I asked them can they--
can they keep it down?

17:53.034 --> 17:57.448
And Andrew starts yelling
at Nicole and saying, like,
I guess, her personal business,

17:57.482 --> 18:00.068
and I was like, hey, you know,
like, come on now, keep it down.

18:00.103 --> 18:04.620
So Andrew starts going--
talking about me, saying how
I'’m like [bleep], or whatever

18:04.655 --> 18:08.896
it was.
And um... and we just start
going back and forth,

18:08.931 --> 18:11.965
and he goes to his car,
and he gets the gun,
and he points it--

18:12.000 --> 18:14.206
-Where are you at
when he grabs the gun?
-I'’m-- I'm still right here.

18:14.241 --> 18:15.448
Well, I think I'’m maybe--
-Down here?

18:15.482 --> 18:16.965
-Yeah.
-On the second flight? Okay.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.896
-And then, um-- uh, I say,
really, Andrew?
He goes, yeah,

18:19.931 --> 18:21.793
for real,
he cocks it back at me.

18:21.827 --> 18:26.862
And then, he'’s-- he's
callin'’ me, like, all types
of black beyotches... and...

18:26.896 --> 18:28.862
-Okay, what does he do
with the firearm?

18:28.896 --> 18:31.896
-He'’s pointing it at me
like this, and he'’s like,
I'’ll kill the [bleep]

18:31.931 --> 18:34.689
outta you, like--
and then-- I think--
I was still talking crap,

18:34.724 --> 18:36.655
I was like, you know what,
Andrew, blah blah blah,

18:36.689 --> 18:38.103
and he cocked it back
at me.

18:38.137 --> 18:39.758
And then I was like,
oh, [bleep].

18:39.793 --> 18:42.310
-So, when he had it,
he'’s-- so he grabs the gun
out of the car--

18:42.344 --> 18:43.931
-Yeah, and he...
-He points it at you?

18:43.965 --> 18:45.724
Then he starts
talkin'’ mess to you?
-Yeah.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.758
-And then he... loads a round
into the chamber?

18:47.793 --> 18:50.482
-Yeah, and that'’s when
I was like-- okay, he really
might kill me.

18:50.517 --> 18:52.758
-All right.
These guys have to talk to you
real quick, and then

18:52.793 --> 18:55.137
we'’ll get outta here, okay?

18:55.172 --> 18:57.068
Okay, Andrew?
Here'’s the deal, man.

18:57.103 --> 19:00.482
Senior officer over here
spoke to some other detectives.

19:00.517 --> 19:01.965
We'’re talkin'
with another witness.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.551
It'’s gonna be assault
with deadly weapon.

19:03.586 --> 19:05.586
Because
of the circumstances, okay?

19:05.620 --> 19:07.310
Because, here, Andrew,
listen, okay?

19:07.344 --> 19:08.620
Hold on, I want you
to listen, okay?

19:08.655 --> 19:10.758
-I'’m just up
for a supervisor position
at my job.

19:10.793 --> 19:14.000
-Okay.
Listen... she feels
threatened for her life.

19:14.034 --> 19:15.586
You loaded a round
into the gun.

19:15.620 --> 19:18.793
-I really, like, meant
no harm to anybody,
I'’m harmless.

19:18.827 --> 19:21.758
You know?
Like, I'’m-- I'm a good,
hard-working guy.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.137
-Okay.
-That'’s all I do, I go to work,

19:23.172 --> 19:24.931
I come home,
I take care of my kid.

19:24.965 --> 19:26.827
Look, like, take my gun,
take everything from me,

19:26.862 --> 19:29.655
that'’s fine, but I haven't
been to jail, I'’ve never
had a speeding ticket,

19:29.689 --> 19:32.793
I-- I love the law enforcement.
I'’ll do whatever I need to do.

19:32.827 --> 19:35.862
I'’ll do the-- the classes
before I get to court...

19:35.896 --> 19:37.137
-I get it. I get it.
-anything I need.

19:37.172 --> 19:40.827
-And-- And listen...
suck it up. Andrew...

19:40.862 --> 19:41.965
-[tearful]
This is the worst thing

19:42.000 --> 19:43.068
that could ever happen
to me...

19:43.103 --> 19:44.310
-Of course.
But guess what?
How do you--

19:44.344 --> 19:45.758
-I just wanna
make dinner with my daughter.

19:45.793 --> 19:49.344
-Listen... everybody
makes mistakes. Okay?

19:49.379 --> 19:51.931
-132 and Bush,
I'’ve got him at gunpoint.

19:51.965 --> 19:53.482
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.517 --> 19:54.689
Cover is code three.

19:54.724 --> 19:57.655
-[overlapping
police radio chatter]

20:03.931 --> 20:06.172
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'’ll still send
a code three.

20:06.206 --> 20:11.551
