WEBVTT

00:01.198 --> 00:03.866
Kind of a crazy night.

00:03.917 --> 00:05.868
One more patient, and I am on my way.

00:05.919 --> 00:08.420
So, what seems to be the problem?

00:13.210 --> 00:15.511
<i>Well, let's have a look at you.</i>

00:17.964 --> 00:19.298
Where am I?

00:20.350 --> 00:21.717
Who are you?

00:21.768 --> 00:23.152
My name is sydney.

00:23.219 --> 00:24.820
And...

00:31.494 --> 00:34.029
Here's where you are.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.969
Now... I trust we're feeling all right?

00:40.036 --> 00:41.770
Not too many bumps and bruises?

00:41.838 --> 00:43.505
After all, we're going to need you

00:43.573 --> 00:44.907
In tip-top shape.

00:44.975 --> 00:46.592
Need me for what?

00:46.676 --> 00:47.877
Nothing too difficult.

00:47.928 --> 00:50.613
At least not for one of the cia's best.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.715
No, no, no, you got me
mixed up with someone else.

00:52.766 --> 00:53.949
I'm just a doctor.

00:54.017 --> 00:56.251
We know exactly who you are, devon.

00:58.388 --> 00:59.939
So, please,

01:00.023 --> 01:02.308
Tell me...

01:06.363 --> 01:08.113
...What's it like being a world-class spy?

01:09.482 --> 01:10.900
Chuck, stop freaking out.

01:10.951 --> 01:12.151
Oh, I'm not freaking out.

01:12.235 --> 01:13.802
I'll tell you why I'm not freaking out.

01:13.870 --> 01:15.454
That would require me overreacting,

01:15.538 --> 01:16.956
And I don't think it's technically possible

01:17.040 --> 01:19.291
For me to overreact to my brothe
r-in-law being kidnapped!

01:19.376 --> 01:20.743
We're doing the best we can, chuck.

01:20.794 --> 01:22.378
Why don't you go upstairs, go to work.

01:22.445 --> 01:25.214
We'll call you as soon as we have any news.

01:25.282 --> 01:26.815
Look at that-- ellie is making

01:26.883 --> 01:28.450
Her 50th call to awesome within the hour,

01:28.501 --> 01:30.386
In addition to the 20 that she's

01:30.453 --> 01:31.520
Made to me already today.

01:31.588 --> 01:32.554
She's-she's losing it.

01:32.622 --> 01:34.456
What-what am I supposed to tell her?

01:34.507 --> 01:36.592
Honestly, chuck,
I think the best thing you can do

01:36.643 --> 01:38.126
Is to just calm down.

01:38.178 --> 01:39.228
Here's a little tip: If you really

01:39.295 --> 01:40.229
Want someone to calm down,

01:40.296 --> 01:41.730
Never tell them to calm down,

01:41.798 --> 01:43.499
Because it doesn't work!
They don't calm down!

01:43.566 --> 01:44.850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

01:44.935 --> 01:46.485
I'm sorry. I'm calming down.

01:47.737 --> 01:48.837
Here comes the calm.

01:48.905 --> 01:50.305
I will soon...

01:50.357 --> 01:52.491
Be calm.

01:52.575 --> 01:54.142
Not working. I'm not calming down.

01:54.194 --> 01:55.778
I tell you what-- I got an idea.

01:55.845 --> 01:57.012
I'm going to go to work,

01:57.080 --> 01:58.364
And then you guys call me

01:58.448 --> 01:59.648
<i>The absolute second that you hear</i>

01:59.699 --> 02:01.984
<i>Anything about devon.</i>

02:05.989 --> 02:07.323
<i>Big mike: Calm down, morgan.</i>

02:07.390 --> 02:08.857
You got nothing to worry about, son.

02:08.925 --> 02:11.360
So, you can wipe that
concerned look off that...

02:11.428 --> 02:12.861
Hairy face.

02:12.929 --> 02:14.430
Yeah, well, it's just...
It's a little unusual

02:14.497 --> 02:15.631
That you would call me in

02:15.699 --> 02:17.433
Before I even have time
to screw anything up.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.434
You're right.

02:18.501 --> 02:20.369
Usually, mornings are big mike time.

02:20.437 --> 02:22.504
Time for reflection and-and pastry.

02:22.572 --> 02:24.273
But I'll tell you something, son.

02:24.340 --> 02:25.941
You've become like family to me.

02:26.009 --> 02:27.876
Oh. Thank you, sir. No.

02:27.944 --> 02:29.378
Thank your mama.

02:29.446 --> 02:32.281
Woman makes me feel good.

02:32.348 --> 02:33.682
Real good.

02:33.733 --> 02:35.050
Like a man should.

02:35.118 --> 02:37.286
But credit where it's due.

02:37.353 --> 02:39.021
I've noticed a change in you lately.

02:39.072 --> 02:41.407
You're commanding more
respect from your coworkers.

02:41.491 --> 02:43.625
You're walking a little taller around here.

02:43.693 --> 02:45.294
Seems to me...

02:45.362 --> 02:47.129
You're ready to run with the big dogs.

02:47.196 --> 02:48.363
Of course.

02:48.415 --> 02:50.065
Wait, what?

02:50.133 --> 02:52.200
Morgan, are you ready to
be my assistant manager?

02:52.252 --> 02:53.635
Me, sir?

02:53.703 --> 02:54.937
I believe in you, son.

02:57.273 --> 02:58.774
Well?

02:58.842 --> 03:00.509
Yes.

03:05.015 --> 03:06.882
Yeah, this will be good.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.484
One of the big dogs.

03:09.719 --> 03:12.387
No. Don't do that.

03:12.439 --> 03:14.223
That's a little dog- schnauzer or something.

03:14.290 --> 03:15.407
big dog.

03:15.492 --> 03:16.558
<i>Hey, sarah-- chuck.</i>

03:16.609 --> 03:17.776
I had an idea-- delta force.

03:17.861 --> 03:18.994
Have you called them yet?

03:19.062 --> 03:20.496
If not, call me back
with their number, okay?

03:20.563 --> 03:21.580
Ah. Just in time.

03:21.664 --> 03:22.898
Need that big brain of yours, charles.

03:22.949 --> 03:24.266
Jeff is dead wrong about something.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.234
Well, that's kind of his
default setting, is it not?

03:26.286 --> 03:27.252
Excuse me, sir.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.620
Can you help me?

03:28.705 --> 03:31.290
I understand you're having
a big sale on hdtvs.

03:31.374 --> 03:32.407
Uh, yes, we are.

03:32.459 --> 03:34.376
Lester or jeff here could actually...

03:36.296 --> 03:37.379
Sarah.

03:38.515 --> 03:39.581
Seriously, charles,

03:39.632 --> 03:40.799
It's an emergency here.

03:40.884 --> 03:43.102
Young man, you even listening?

03:45.000 --> 03:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:02.872 --> 04:04.323
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

04:04.407 --> 04:06.041
I went... That's not what I meant to say.

04:07.276 --> 04:08.577
Impressive.

04:08.628 --> 04:09.828
Now, if jean-claude van damme

04:09.913 --> 04:11.279
And steven seagal got into a fight,

04:11.331 --> 04:12.498
Who do you think would win?

04:12.582 --> 04:13.632
This is your big question?

04:13.716 --> 04:15.450
Bear in mind that master seagal's

04:15.502 --> 04:17.168
Fighting style choice is aikido-- like so...

04:17.253 --> 04:18.286
"I'm just a cook.

04:18.338 --> 04:19.887
I'm a lowly cook."

04:19.956 --> 04:21.723
Come on, buddy!

04:21.791 --> 04:23.559
<i>Come on, buddy. Come on.</i>

04:23.626 --> 04:24.560
I'm not going to hurt you.

04:24.627 --> 04:25.928
What you got? What you got?

04:29.015 --> 04:30.933
Boom, boom, pow!

04:30.984 --> 04:32.901
Okay. I think he'll live,

04:32.969 --> 04:34.436
But we need to get you out of here.

04:34.487 --> 04:36.071
Listen, we think we know who has awesome.

04:36.139 --> 04:37.940
The last patient that he saw at the hospital

04:37.991 --> 04:39.158
Was a ring operative.

04:39.242 --> 04:40.475
What? What, sarah?

04:40.527 --> 04:41.610
The ring? Oh, my god.

04:41.661 --> 04:42.811
This is all my fault.

04:42.862 --> 04:44.646
I'm the one who got him
involved in all this.

04:44.697 --> 04:46.248
They're probably torturing him as we speak.

04:46.315 --> 04:47.916
No, there is no reason to think that.
Yeah, you're right.

04:47.984 --> 04:49.351
There are hundreds of
other nightmare scenarios

04:49.419 --> 04:51.003
Far worse. Uh, chuck...

04:51.087 --> 04:52.204
No, don't you understand?

04:52.288 --> 04:53.205
I'm responsible for this.

04:53.289 --> 04:55.090
I killed captain awesome.

04:55.158 --> 04:56.675
Oh, my god.

04:56.759 --> 04:57.826
You're back.

04:57.877 --> 04:59.161
Thank god.

04:59.212 --> 05:00.662
Oh, my god, you're back. You're back.

05:00.713 --> 05:02.264
This is... This is great news.

05:02.331 --> 05:03.699
This is very good news. Are you okay?

05:03.766 --> 05:05.267
Tell me you're okay.

05:05.334 --> 05:07.569
Chuck, they think I'm a spy.

05:08.671 --> 05:10.556
I'm in trouble here, man.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.057
They think I'm you.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.623
From what he has told us,
we can conclude that the woman

05:57.707 --> 05:59.541
Devon was with is sydney prince,

05:59.608 --> 06:01.676
The head of a ring cell in los angeles.

06:01.744 --> 06:04.146
She has tried to recruit
several of our agents.

06:04.213 --> 06:05.330
She knows everything about me, chuck.

06:05.715 --> 06:07.115
Ellie, too.

06:07.183 --> 06:10.018
Everything except who the
real spy in the family is.

06:10.086 --> 06:11.436
That's an understandable mistake.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.221
One of them looks like a spy,

06:13.272 --> 06:15.156
And the other one looks... Like chuck.

06:15.224 --> 06:16.808
True. She gave me this.

06:16.892 --> 06:19.127
She told me she'd contact
me with instructions.

06:19.195 --> 06:20.662
It's a ring communication device, general.

06:20.730 --> 06:22.630
Exactly. It works off a closed network,

06:22.698 --> 06:24.699
But the nsa has recently developed

06:24.767 --> 06:26.267
New technology to crack it.

06:26.318 --> 06:27.869
Now we can put it into use.

06:27.936 --> 06:28.987
All right. Fantastic news.

06:29.071 --> 06:30.038
Sounds like a plan.

06:30.105 --> 06:31.156
I'm going to get awesome back

06:31.240 --> 06:32.440
To my sister before she has an aneurysm.

06:32.491 --> 06:34.709
You can't take him home quite yet, chuck.

06:34.777 --> 06:36.995
We still need to talk about
how we're going to use devon.

06:37.079 --> 06:38.329
Excuse me-- what? Oh, no, no.

06:38.414 --> 06:39.631
No one's using devon.

06:39.715 --> 06:42.484
There will be no using of him anymore.

06:42.551 --> 06:44.669
Okay, no more fun spy
games for him, forever.

06:44.754 --> 06:46.721
Using devon is our best option.

06:46.789 --> 06:50.358
Sydney won't go to her
superiors with his identity

06:50.426 --> 06:51.476
Until she definitively knows

06:51.560 --> 06:53.161
Whether she has turned him or burned him.

06:53.229 --> 06:54.496
When sydney contacts him,

06:54.563 --> 06:56.398
He'll do what she says
just long enough for us

06:56.465 --> 06:57.866
To track her, find her and bring her in.

06:57.933 --> 06:59.334
You mean I have to do what she says?

06:59.402 --> 07:00.735
No, you don't. No, he doesn't.

07:00.803 --> 07:03.204
This is my family we're talking about here.

07:03.272 --> 07:05.607
Come on. It's the only way to keep him safe.

07:07.026 --> 07:09.411
Devon, we'll be with you
every step of the way.

07:09.478 --> 07:12.781
If you tell me you can get
me through this, I trust you.

07:16.085 --> 07:18.119
I will, devon.

07:19.822 --> 07:21.856
I promise.

07:21.924 --> 07:23.425
<i>Um, excuse me.</i>

07:23.492 --> 07:24.526
Stop right there.

07:24.593 --> 07:26.344
Are you leaving early again, bartowski?

07:26.429 --> 07:27.762
Are you serious?

07:27.830 --> 07:29.597
No, of course not, man. I'm kidding.

07:29.665 --> 07:31.032
No, I mean, are you being serious?

07:31.100 --> 07:32.667
Are you seriously wearing
that vest right now?

07:32.718 --> 07:33.935
Ah.

07:34.002 --> 07:36.604
Big mike made me...

07:36.672 --> 07:37.872
Assistant manager.

07:37.940 --> 07:39.057
And I accepted it.

07:39.141 --> 07:40.725
Boom.

07:40.810 --> 07:41.943
Well, congratulations, buddy.

07:42.011 --> 07:43.061
I'm proud of you.

07:43.145 --> 07:44.612
Charles.

07:44.680 --> 07:45.680
Oh!

07:45.731 --> 07:47.198
Oh, wow.

07:47.283 --> 07:48.900
Lester, I'm really sorry

07:48.984 --> 07:50.285
About the...

07:50.352 --> 07:52.220
That was a completely kne
e-jerk reaction. You know what?

07:52.288 --> 07:54.072
I'm just going to switch
to decaf from now on.

07:54.156 --> 07:55.089
It's not a problem.

07:55.157 --> 07:56.891
In fact, I want to thank you.

07:56.959 --> 07:58.877
You helped me feel something

07:58.961 --> 08:00.879
I have not felt in a long time.

08:00.963 --> 08:02.597
Another human's foot on your body?

08:03.632 --> 08:05.032
The thrill of being alive.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.751
What? The electrifying sensation

08:06.836 --> 08:08.570
Of pain coursing through my face

08:08.637 --> 08:11.306
Was like an adrenaline shot to my soul.

08:11.373 --> 08:13.541
It made me feel like a man,

08:13.592 --> 08:15.276
Maybe for the first time
since my bar mitzvah.

08:15.344 --> 08:16.578
I've never had a bar mitzvah.

08:16.645 --> 08:17.979
Chuck, please.

08:18.046 --> 08:20.047
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.600
I... I think

08:22.685 --> 08:25.019
That you two are certifiably disturbed.

08:25.070 --> 08:26.187
I'm going to go home.

08:26.238 --> 08:27.405
So... Hey.

08:27.490 --> 08:28.656
Uh, you want a ride home?

08:28.724 --> 08:30.725
Yeah, I got access to the company car.

08:30.776 --> 08:32.277
Oh, big man on campus. All right.

08:32.361 --> 08:33.912
Well, actually, uh,
awesome's at the mall today,

08:33.996 --> 08:35.780
And we got to talk about a few things,

08:35.865 --> 08:37.030
So I'll see you at home.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.950
Oh. All right.

08:41.253 --> 08:42.253
You okay, man?

08:42.337 --> 08:43.705
No, no, it's ellie.

08:43.756 --> 08:44.923
God, chuck.

08:45.007 --> 08:47.208
What am I going to tell
her about where I've been?

08:47.259 --> 08:48.676
I'm a terrible liar, man.

08:49.745 --> 08:51.112
Devon, is that you?

08:51.180 --> 08:52.714
Remember to keep it simple.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.132
Simple.

08:54.216 --> 08:55.266
Oh, thank god.

08:55.351 --> 08:57.218
I was so worried.

08:57.269 --> 08:59.971
Yeah, babe, I'm... I'm fine.

09:00.055 --> 09:01.189
Why didn't you call?

09:01.256 --> 09:02.974
Um, uh...

09:03.058 --> 09:05.226
After I got off the overnight,

09:05.277 --> 09:08.363
I decided I needed to clear my head.

09:08.430 --> 09:11.282
So, I went for a run...

09:11.367 --> 09:13.818
In griffith park.

09:13.903 --> 09:15.904
No cell phones there.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.789
Uh-uh. So, I'm running,

09:17.873 --> 09:19.340
And I just... I heard something

09:19.408 --> 09:20.708
In a tree.

09:20.776 --> 09:21.876
It was a...

09:22.962 --> 09:24.128
It's a cat.

09:24.213 --> 09:25.847
A hurt cat.

09:25.915 --> 09:27.749
I had to see if it needed medical attention.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.084
Then, I realized...

09:35.758 --> 09:36.925
It's a bear.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.893
What's a bear? The cat's a bear?

09:38.961 --> 09:40.311
Yeah, yeah, the cat's a bear.

09:40.396 --> 09:41.813
It's a... It's a bear, and it...

09:41.897 --> 09:43.097
Jumps out at me,

09:43.148 --> 09:44.265
And it attacks, and it's like...

09:44.316 --> 09:45.767
It's angry at me

09:45.818 --> 09:47.852
For some reason, this bear.

09:47.937 --> 09:48.903
Oh, my god!

09:48.971 --> 09:50.488
You were attacked by a bear?

09:50.573 --> 09:52.690
Yeah, and I... I...

09:52.775 --> 09:54.075
Cut off its head.

09:55.578 --> 09:58.947
Yeah, babe, I... I decapitated the bear.

09:58.998 --> 10:02.250
In self-defense, in order to survive.

10:02.318 --> 10:04.285
I'm just glad you weren't there to see it.

10:04.336 --> 10:05.553
It was really grisly.

10:07.756 --> 10:10.174
Do you honestly expect me to believe this?

10:10.259 --> 10:12.377
Because you two think I'm an idiot.

10:12.461 --> 10:13.628
Is that what you think?

10:13.679 --> 10:14.629
No, no, no.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.847
That is not what we think.

10:15.931 --> 10:17.715
That is not what we think.

10:17.800 --> 10:22.353
I think that it's time that
we tell ellie the truth.

10:22.438 --> 10:23.972
Oh, yeah. Thank god, chuck.

10:24.023 --> 10:25.473
The truth.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.275
I'm terrible at this.
I'm a terrible liar, honey.

10:27.342 --> 10:28.743
You know that.

10:28.811 --> 10:30.211
Clearly.

10:30.279 --> 10:32.113
Casey was arrested

10:32.180 --> 10:33.881
Early this morning in griffith park.

10:33.949 --> 10:35.650
He was drunk, super drunk.

10:35.701 --> 10:36.701
Really blotto.

10:36.785 --> 10:38.086
Cop's words, not mine.

10:38.153 --> 10:39.754
He was in bad shape, wasn't he, devon?

10:39.822 --> 10:41.406
Yeah.

10:42.491 --> 10:43.491
Yeah, it was bad, hon.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.411
He wet himself.

10:46.495 --> 10:47.996
Also exposed himself.

10:48.047 --> 10:50.999
Anyhow, devon... Spent most of the day,

10:51.050 --> 10:53.334
Pretty much all day down at the station

10:53.385 --> 10:55.036
Talking to a buddy of his on the force

10:55.087 --> 10:56.604
Trying to get the charges dropped, so...

10:56.672 --> 10:57.755
Oh, my god.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.806
Really?

10:58.874 --> 11:00.842
Really. Really.

11:02.394 --> 11:03.978
Hey, guys.

11:04.046 --> 11:05.480
Ugh.

11:08.183 --> 11:10.518
Uh, let's go inside, devon.

11:13.522 --> 11:15.523
What?

11:17.559 --> 11:18.693
Nothing.

11:39.515 --> 11:40.798
Jeff?

11:40.883 --> 11:41.849
You got a second?

11:41.917 --> 11:43.551
What's going on here, man?

11:44.937 --> 11:45.970
I noticed everybody's a little beat up.

11:46.055 --> 11:46.938
The first rule of fight...

11:47.022 --> 11:48.556
Easy.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.108
Our friend, morgan, here is

11:50.192 --> 11:51.693
The assistant manager now.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.860
Oh, guys.

11:52.928 --> 11:54.529
We've worked together for a long time.

11:54.596 --> 11:56.447
You know, we're... We're chums.

11:56.532 --> 11:57.699
Whatever you say.

11:58.784 --> 11:59.901
Ass man.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.620
Don't you mean, mr. Ass man?

12:02.705 --> 12:04.822
I do not.

12:11.547 --> 12:13.214
<i>I can't believe the ring thinks awesome's a
spy.</i>

12:13.281 --> 12:15.133
This is crazy. This-this is crazy.

12:15.217 --> 12:16.551
When do you think she's gonna call?

12:16.618 --> 12:17.802
What do you think she's gonna say?

12:17.886 --> 12:19.887
What do you think we do when she does call?

12:19.955 --> 12:21.389
Chuck, the important thing is

12:21.456 --> 12:23.391
That devon will be looking
to you as his handler.

12:23.458 --> 12:25.059
And you need to remember what it felt like

12:25.127 --> 12:27.061
To be scared and new to this.

12:27.129 --> 12:28.896
Yeah, like he'll ever forget that.

12:28.964 --> 12:30.565
Think of it this way: On this mission,

12:30.632 --> 12:31.799
Devon is you and you're her.

12:31.850 --> 12:34.135
So, be her, chuck, huh?

12:34.186 --> 12:36.637
Well, maybe sydney will never call?

12:36.688 --> 12:37.989
captain: Guys.

12:38.073 --> 12:39.157
Guys, it's me.

12:39.241 --> 12:40.358
You in there?

12:40.442 --> 12:41.659
She called.

12:41.744 --> 12:42.777
What's that?

12:42.828 --> 12:43.778
Found it on my front step.

12:43.829 --> 12:44.779
It's from sydney.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.280
I gotta open it right away.

12:46.331 --> 12:48.616
She's gonna call in about
five minutes. Come on.

12:55.090 --> 12:56.374
What do you think is in there?

13:02.698 --> 13:05.550
It's okay, answer it.

13:07.352 --> 13:08.669
Hello?

13:09.688 --> 13:11.305
From now on, devon,

13:11.356 --> 13:13.024
I will speak to you through the earpiece

13:13.108 --> 13:14.342
Included in the package.

13:14.409 --> 13:16.978
And you will speak to me
through the watch we sent.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.180
Now, put in the earpiece,
and put on the watch.

13:21.483 --> 13:22.733
Par for the course.

13:22.818 --> 13:24.285
Just do what she says.

13:24.352 --> 13:27.738
Okay, putting on the earpiece now.

13:27.823 --> 13:31.659
Now we can track you on our own gps network.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.544
It's fine.

13:33.629 --> 13:35.596
Standard operating procedure.

13:35.664 --> 13:38.082
Be at the crystal towers
downtown in one hour.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.767
Come alone.

13:39.835 --> 13:43.671
Oh, and, devon, the earpiece
is also an explosive device.

13:43.722 --> 13:46.240
Remove it, or deviate from
my instructions in any way,

13:46.308 --> 13:48.976
And I will detonate it,

13:49.044 --> 13:52.880
Ruining that lovely face of yours.

13:53.982 --> 13:56.150
No.

13:56.218 --> 13:59.520
Okay, well, that is not standard... At all.

14:06.017 --> 14:07.634
<i>Chuck?</i>

14:07.702 --> 14:09.403
Chuck, it's me. Can you hear me?

14:09.471 --> 14:11.672
Yes, yes, buddy, yes. I'm-I'm right here.

14:11.739 --> 14:13.907
And you're sure they can't
hear me talking to you?

14:13.975 --> 14:16.743
They can only hear you if you
press the button on their watch.

14:16.811 --> 14:19.079
An open bug would be far too easy to trace.

14:19.147 --> 14:21.999
I've labeled the watches
so you don't get confused.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.700
Devon, this is sarah.

14:23.785 --> 14:24.985
As soon as sydney calls,

14:25.036 --> 14:26.520
Casey's going to start tracking the signal.

14:26.588 --> 14:27.955
As soon as we've tracked her location,

14:28.006 --> 14:29.990
We're going to bring her
in and then you're done.

14:30.058 --> 14:31.658
Whew.

14:31.709 --> 14:32.676
Okay, good.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.128
Chuck, this gonna work, right, buddy?

14:34.179 --> 14:35.328
Remember,

14:35.380 --> 14:37.047
If you freak out, he's going to freak out.

14:37.132 --> 14:40.000
This is absolutely going to work.

14:40.051 --> 14:42.219
Everything is fine.

14:42.303 --> 14:44.938
I am very confident.

14:45.006 --> 14:46.190
sydney: Devon?

14:46.274 --> 14:47.441
Are you ready to begin?

14:50.562 --> 14:52.863
Ready.

14:52.947 --> 14:54.231
There is a penthouse on the 12th floor.

14:54.315 --> 14:55.365
Go there.

14:55.450 --> 14:56.617
The building has extensive security,

14:56.684 --> 14:58.585
But it's nothing that you can't handle.

14:58.653 --> 15:00.787
We'll talk again once you're there.

15:00.855 --> 15:02.789
She's close.

15:02.857 --> 15:05.042
Wasn't on the line long enough
to get an exact location.

15:05.126 --> 15:06.360
Need another call. Another call?!

15:06.427 --> 15:07.794
No, we can't wait.

15:07.862 --> 15:09.796
The guy's got an explosive
earpiece stuck in his head!

15:09.864 --> 15:11.364
Chuck, our target is sydney.

15:11.416 --> 15:13.200
We need to get her to save him.

15:13.251 --> 15:14.701
Okay, fine, then you get her,

15:14.752 --> 15:16.203
And I'll get awesome up to the 12th floor.

15:16.254 --> 15:18.138
Buddy, head inside the building and wait.

15:18.206 --> 15:19.806
Wait? Wait for what?

15:22.777 --> 15:24.561
Wait for me.

15:28.716 --> 15:31.068
Good luck.

15:34.555 --> 15:36.323
Chuck?

15:36.390 --> 15:37.557
Chuck, where are you?

15:37.609 --> 15:38.742
I'm on my way, buddy.

15:42.330 --> 15:43.947
Here to see someone in the building?

15:49.037 --> 15:50.204
Well...

15:50.255 --> 15:51.238
Yeah.

15:51.289 --> 15:53.440
Yeah, kinda.

15:53.508 --> 15:55.876
I'm here to meet... Meet my friend.

15:55.927 --> 15:57.277
Chuck.

16:02.133 --> 16:03.517
Does this chuck work here?

16:03.584 --> 16:05.469
He could work here.

16:05.553 --> 16:07.137
He might. Okay, pal.

16:07.222 --> 16:08.689
Take it easy.

16:08.756 --> 16:09.973
I'm building security.

16:11.592 --> 16:13.026
My name's julius.

16:13.094 --> 16:14.228
What's the problem?

16:16.531 --> 16:18.148
You can tell me.

16:20.652 --> 16:22.636
I'm involved in something
really messed up, man.

16:22.704 --> 16:24.154
Been lying to my wife.

16:24.239 --> 16:25.639
Been lying to everybody.

16:26.674 --> 16:28.442
I can't take it anymore.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.294
Because of this chuck guy?

16:30.378 --> 16:32.045
Yeah. Yeah, chuck.

16:32.113 --> 16:34.648
I think I understand.

16:34.716 --> 16:36.216
Look, pal,

16:36.284 --> 16:38.252
If you really love this chuck,

16:38.303 --> 16:39.286
You have to tell your wife.

16:39.337 --> 16:41.138
You can't live a lie.

16:41.222 --> 16:44.141
Trust me, I've been there.

16:44.225 --> 16:46.226
That's not really what I mean.

16:46.294 --> 16:47.394
Sure, it isn't.

16:48.479 --> 16:49.346
Oh!

16:51.482 --> 16:52.349
Chuck!

16:52.433 --> 16:53.567
You killed julius!

16:53.634 --> 16:55.402
What? Kill?! I would never do that.

16:55.469 --> 16:56.853
It's a tranq gun.

16:58.156 --> 16:59.773
That's preposterous.

16:59.824 --> 17:01.742
Killing someone.

17:01.809 --> 17:04.361
Come on. Bingo.

17:04.444 --> 17:05.612
All right,

17:05.663 --> 17:07.079
He's going to be fine. Come on.

17:07.147 --> 17:09.165
¶ ¶

17:15.923 --> 17:18.090
So, what do you think is up there?

17:18.159 --> 17:19.425
Something pretty gnarly, huh?

17:19.492 --> 17:20.761
It's best not to speculate.

17:20.828 --> 17:22.429
I mean, nine times out of ten--

17:22.496 --> 17:23.663
Well, seven--

17:23.714 --> 17:25.848
You get yourself all worked up over nothing.

17:30.438 --> 17:32.439
See? Nothing to worry about.

17:39.314 --> 17:40.564
Hey, you're not allowed up here!

17:49.540 --> 17:50.824
Look out.

17:56.497 --> 17:58.715
Dude, you're incredible!

17:58.800 --> 18:00.267
Was that your spy training?

18:00.335 --> 18:02.336
Duck hunt. Nintendo.

18:05.673 --> 18:06.757
Devon?

18:06.841 --> 18:07.808
Yes, sydney.

18:07.875 --> 18:09.509
Good, you're alive.

18:09.577 --> 18:12.262
Down the hall to your
left is an unmarked door.

18:12.347 --> 18:14.264
The lock works via retina scan.

18:14.349 --> 18:15.732
Cut out one of the guards' eyes

18:15.817 --> 18:17.918
And use it to open the door.

18:17.985 --> 18:19.936
What?

18:20.021 --> 18:21.988
We got to cut out one of these
guys' eyes for the scan!

18:22.056 --> 18:23.573
I took an oath, bro.

18:23.658 --> 18:25.125
I can't cut out a man's eye.

18:25.193 --> 18:27.327
I got a better idea.

18:27.395 --> 18:28.745
Captain : Jeez, this guy's heavy.

18:28.830 --> 18:30.197
Yeah.

18:30.248 --> 18:32.466
Well, bad guys don't count carbs, buddy.

18:42.710 --> 18:44.644
Sarah, we have reached the 12th floor,

18:44.712 --> 18:46.012
But what the heck is going on?

18:46.080 --> 18:48.014
This is a cia facility.

18:48.082 --> 18:50.016
Sarah? Hello?

18:50.084 --> 18:51.451
Chuck? Hello?

18:51.519 --> 18:52.686
I lost him.

18:53.971 --> 18:55.755
Tracked her. She's...

18:56.774 --> 18:58.475
She's right here.

19:00.728 --> 19:02.229
That's her.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.730
let's go!

19:03.781 --> 19:05.565
What the hell?!

19:07.601 --> 19:09.152
Casey, walker. Stand down.

19:09.237 --> 19:10.320
General, we have a visual on sydney.

19:10.405 --> 19:11.571
She just walked past us.

19:11.622 --> 19:14.374
<i>She's heading inside the building.</i>

19:18.779 --> 19:21.131
I've just received new
mission information, colonel.

19:21.215 --> 19:23.183
Your new directive is to stand down.

19:23.251 --> 19:24.617
General, chuck has reached the 12th floor,

19:24.669 --> 19:26.386
And he says it's some kind of cia base.

19:26.454 --> 19:28.138
If that's true, then this
is some kind of a setup.

19:28.222 --> 19:32.092
Yes, that's exactly what this is.

19:34.896 --> 19:36.730
Excellent work, devon.

19:36.797 --> 19:38.064
You're almost finished.

19:38.132 --> 19:40.517
There's a man in the office
at the end of the hall.

19:40.601 --> 19:42.152
Chuck, sydney says there's
a man in the office

19:42.236 --> 19:43.186
At the end of the hall.

19:43.271 --> 19:45.071
Find him.

19:45.139 --> 19:47.107
And kill him.

19:47.158 --> 19:50.177
Chuck, she wants us to
find him and kill him.

19:50.244 --> 19:52.746
Nobody's going to kill anybody, okay?

19:52.814 --> 19:56.283
Just calm down and stay close.

20:04.709 --> 20:06.676
Excuse me, sir?

20:06.761 --> 20:08.762
Excuse me, I know this is a little awkward,

20:08.829 --> 20:09.996
But don't move.

20:10.064 --> 20:11.998
But also don't be afraid.

20:12.049 --> 20:13.350
My name is... Chuck.

20:14.402 --> 20:16.002
Chuck bartowski.

20:16.053 --> 20:18.004
I know.

20:18.072 --> 20:19.723
How... How do you... How do you know that?

20:19.808 --> 20:23.027
I know things, lots of things,
about you, about them.

20:23.111 --> 20:24.228
What-what do you know about the ring?

20:24.312 --> 20:25.145
What are they doing here? What do they want?

20:25.213 --> 20:26.179
Why do they need devon?

20:26.231 --> 20:27.180
They don't need anything.

20:27.232 --> 20:28.181
They already have everything.

20:28.233 --> 20:29.233
Simple as that.

20:29.317 --> 20:30.651
Now, sydney will be here any minute.

20:30.702 --> 20:31.685
We've got to do this.

20:31.753 --> 20:32.853
Syd-sydney's coming here?

20:32.904 --> 20:34.204
You know she wants me to kill you, right?

20:34.289 --> 20:35.372
But don't worry, I'm-I'm not gonna do that.

20:35.457 --> 20:37.541
However, we do need a plan. I've got one.

20:37.625 --> 20:40.361
You're going to kill me, chuck.

20:40.428 --> 20:43.030
What? No.

20:43.081 --> 20:44.898
No, no, no, no. I don't kill people.

20:44.966 --> 20:47.584
Okay? I have rules against such things.

20:47.669 --> 20:49.136
Shoot me. Here.

20:49.203 --> 20:50.537
Try to be precise.

20:50.588 --> 20:51.972
Are you listening to anything
I'm saying right now?

20:52.040 --> 20:53.090
I don't kill people.

20:53.174 --> 20:54.374
Therefore, I don't shoot them.

20:54.426 --> 20:55.876
Maybe with a tranq gun.
I'll tranq anybody you want.

20:55.927 --> 20:57.428
But a gun-gun. I hate gun-guns.

20:58.563 --> 21:00.397
Listen, if you don't kill me now,

21:00.482 --> 21:01.765
You and devon are as good as dead.

21:01.850 --> 21:02.733
Well, I'm not gonna do it!

21:02.817 --> 21:04.435
Chuck.

21:04.519 --> 21:06.053
I have to die. Now.

21:06.104 --> 21:07.220
The ring knows too much.

21:07.272 --> 21:08.822
There's no other way.

21:08.890 --> 21:10.390
So, just do it.

21:10.442 --> 21:11.408
Shoot me.

21:17.999 --> 21:19.783
I-I-I can't do it.

21:19.868 --> 21:21.251
I can't do it.

21:21.336 --> 21:23.754
Afterward, put the gun in
devon's hands, then hide.

21:23.838 --> 21:26.440
When she's leaves, open this.

21:32.464 --> 21:35.432
Truth is, I hate guns, too.

21:35.517 --> 21:37.935
Who are you?

21:43.091 --> 21:44.458
Chuck!

21:44.526 --> 21:46.226
Huh? What?

21:46.277 --> 21:47.728
What, no, I didn't-- no!

21:47.779 --> 21:49.646
That's not me, I didn't shoot him, I swear!

21:52.567 --> 21:55.268
He's dead.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.288
Chuck, this is not a tranq gun.

22:03.411 --> 22:04.711
Okay, listen to me.

22:04.779 --> 22:06.296
<i>Remember, you shot him.</i>

22:30.972 --> 22:33.023
Gun?

22:35.977 --> 22:38.412
Take off the watch.

22:51.259 --> 22:54.327
Well done.

22:54.379 --> 22:57.047
<i>Cute and talented.</i>

22:58.967 --> 23:00.517
What a catch.

23:03.972 --> 23:07.191
Lose the body, keep the phone.

23:07.275 --> 23:08.692
We'll be in touch.

23:08.776 --> 23:11.228
Welcome to the ring.

23:16.818 --> 23:19.486
Chuck, chuck, what the
hell is going on right now?

23:24.525 --> 23:27.794
"med kit in desk. The pill was amiodarone.

23:27.862 --> 23:29.196
Save me"?

23:29.247 --> 23:30.363
Amiodarone.

23:30.415 --> 23:32.549
Amiodarone stops your heart,

23:32.634 --> 23:34.168
Only momentarily though.

23:34.219 --> 23:36.170
If it's a clean shot I think I can save him.

23:37.422 --> 23:39.139
Here.

23:57.108 --> 24:00.327
To answer your question,

24:00.394 --> 24:01.862
My name is shaw.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.250
I would like to introduce you all

24:11.302 --> 24:13.353
To cia special agent daniel shaw.

24:13.420 --> 24:15.989
For the last five years,
he has worked on nothing

24:16.056 --> 24:17.557
But taking out the ring.

24:17.608 --> 24:20.226
From this point on, agent shaw
has total command authority

24:20.277 --> 24:23.396
On any mission having
anything to do with the ring.

24:23.464 --> 24:25.482
Really? This guy? I have back issues

24:25.566 --> 24:27.500
<i>Of guns & ammo older than he is.</i>

24:27.568 --> 24:29.903
Be that as it may, you should all know

24:29.954 --> 24:32.372
That I've been fully briefed on
the details of the intersect.

24:34.708 --> 24:37.243
That's right. I know everything.

24:40.464 --> 24:41.714
Thank you very much, general.

24:41.782 --> 24:43.049
I'll take it from here.

24:43.116 --> 24:45.885
Colonel, walker, chuck,
you're in good hands.

24:45.953 --> 24:48.221
Good luck.

24:48.288 --> 24:50.924
Here's an overview of current ring intel.

24:50.975 --> 24:52.291
Great, welcome to the team.

24:52.343 --> 24:53.643
But sydney is still out there,

24:53.727 --> 24:55.127
Which means my brothe
r-in-law's still in danger.

24:55.179 --> 24:56.229
Not for long.

24:56.296 --> 24:57.564
As you've seen, the ring operates

24:57.631 --> 24:59.499
Through a network of decentralized cells.

24:59.567 --> 25:01.234
If we catch sydney, there's a good chance

25:01.301 --> 25:02.902
We can contain devon's identity.

25:02.970 --> 25:05.605
He's a bona fide mole in their operation.

25:05.656 --> 25:08.658
In order to save him, we have to use him.

25:08.742 --> 25:10.276
What? No! No way!

25:10.344 --> 25:11.377
I've already been over this.

25:11.445 --> 25:12.862
Devon is out of the spy business

25:12.947 --> 25:14.113
For good. Chuck,

25:14.165 --> 25:15.331
As long as sydney is alive,

25:15.416 --> 25:16.449
Devon is a marked man.

25:16.500 --> 25:17.450
She's right, chuck.

25:17.501 --> 25:18.868
Casey, sarah, please!

25:18.953 --> 25:20.286
Explain the risks to him.

25:20.337 --> 25:22.705
The risks are greater for
devon if we don't use him.

25:22.790 --> 25:24.057
Sydney would sooner kill him

25:24.124 --> 25:25.959
Than let him go. Well, I don't care.

25:26.010 --> 25:27.126
He's not a spy.

25:27.178 --> 25:31.097
Well, chuck, then I guess the question is:

25:31.164 --> 25:32.665
Do you have a better plan?

25:43.878 --> 25:46.479
<i>Where in the hell is everyone?</i>

25:52.686 --> 25:54.954
What is that?

25:55.022 --> 25:58.374
¶ ¶

26:04.298 --> 26:06.216
A fight club?

26:06.300 --> 26:07.967
No, no!

26:08.035 --> 26:10.202
No! We cannot have this, guys!

26:10.254 --> 26:12.505
Come on, there's, you know,
insurance issues.

26:19.980 --> 26:21.481
Who's next?!

26:23.267 --> 26:24.684
Who wants to regain their manhood?

26:24.735 --> 26:25.902
Lester, come on, man,

26:25.986 --> 26:27.487
We talked about this.
We can't have this anymore.

26:27.554 --> 26:29.072
You have to cut this out!

26:29.156 --> 26:30.240
You can.

26:31.659 --> 26:33.059
It's like I'm talking to a wall.

26:36.497 --> 26:39.231
Lester, a little help, please.

26:39.283 --> 26:40.500
No, no!

26:40.567 --> 26:42.735
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

26:42.786 --> 26:44.403
No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

26:44.455 --> 26:45.955
Don't...

26:46.040 --> 26:47.257
Don't... Do not hook that up.

26:47.341 --> 26:49.792
I'm trying to help them.

26:53.514 --> 26:54.847
Okay, no, no!

26:54.915 --> 26:56.266
Hey, listen to me, back to work!

26:56.350 --> 26:58.417
All right, fight club is over!

26:58.469 --> 27:00.303
Over?

27:00.387 --> 27:02.438
Nothing's over till we say it's over.

27:02.523 --> 27:04.757
You may have shut this down,
but you will never

27:04.825 --> 27:06.609
Shut us down.

27:08.812 --> 27:10.396
Ass man.

27:15.152 --> 27:17.487
Yeah. Oh.

27:19.873 --> 27:21.991
nice.

27:22.076 --> 27:23.876
You could at least unplug the battery!

27:23.944 --> 27:25.628
hey.

27:25.713 --> 27:27.613
What's up? Everything okay?

27:27.665 --> 27:29.632
Please don't say another mission, chuck.

27:29.717 --> 27:31.450
I can't take this anymore.

27:31.502 --> 27:32.669
I'm kind of freaking out.

27:32.753 --> 27:33.886
Don't worry, no. No more missions.

27:33.954 --> 27:35.755
I'm sorry that I put you through all this

27:35.806 --> 27:38.508
But I promised you that I would
take care of it, and I am.

27:38.592 --> 27:40.510
Give me the phone.

27:42.846 --> 27:43.896
Thanks.

27:59.830 --> 28:01.497
Chuck, you in there?

28:01.582 --> 28:02.498
Oh, there you are.

28:02.583 --> 28:03.750
Been looking all over for you.

28:03.817 --> 28:05.585
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

28:05.652 --> 28:07.587
'cause I'm in a crisis.

28:07.654 --> 28:09.839
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so am I.

28:09.923 --> 28:11.040
Yeah, of course you are.

28:11.125 --> 28:12.208
My man, still working.

28:12.292 --> 28:14.711
An assistant manager's dream.

28:14.795 --> 28:16.629
On to my nightmare.

28:16.680 --> 28:18.831
Uh, lester turned the cage into a fight club

28:18.882 --> 28:21.334
And attached a battery to the
fence so he can shock people.

28:22.736 --> 28:23.836
You smell that?

28:23.904 --> 28:25.638
That's burnt human hair, dude.

28:25.706 --> 28:28.558
I told them to stop and
no one will listen to me.

28:28.642 --> 28:30.843
Okay, no one will listen to
anything that I have to say.

28:30.911 --> 28:33.396
My job is on the line here.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.199
Yeah, well, it sounds like
you need a plan, buddy.

28:36.283 --> 28:38.067
Exactly. That's exactly what I need.

28:38.152 --> 28:39.619
Dude, I was thinking, I was, like,

28:39.686 --> 28:43.039
You know, I probably need
a plan here but what plan?

28:43.123 --> 28:44.574
You know?

28:50.247 --> 28:51.798
You know-you know sometimes

28:51.865 --> 28:54.250
What I like to do is-is,
uh, open up a problem

28:54.334 --> 28:55.735
And really examine it.

28:55.803 --> 28:57.203
Find its weak points.

28:57.271 --> 29:01.507
And then not be afraid to
just attack it head-on.

29:01.575 --> 29:03.710
Wow.

29:03.777 --> 29:05.812
Wow.

29:05.879 --> 29:07.013
That's some powerful stuff.

29:07.064 --> 29:08.264
Yeah, I think that'll work.

29:08.348 --> 29:10.716
Thanks, man. Yeah, buddy.

29:20.411 --> 29:22.462
How did you activate this phone?

29:22.529 --> 29:24.697
Who is this?

29:24.748 --> 29:26.732
I'm the spy who killed agent shaw.

29:26.784 --> 29:28.868
This is not devon woodcomb.

29:28.936 --> 29:30.737
Yeah, well, you've been
dealing with the wrong man.

29:30.804 --> 29:32.121
Devon was a decoy.

29:32.206 --> 29:34.040
I'm the one who put that bullet

29:34.091 --> 29:36.592
Through agent shaw's chest last night.

29:36.677 --> 29:38.577
I'm the spy that you're looking for.

29:38.629 --> 29:40.963
And I am in charge of this mission now.

29:46.241 --> 29:48.859
Hey, hey, sarah, uh, it's chuck.

29:48.910 --> 29:51.729
Don't be mad at me, but I may
or may not have called sydney

29:51.796 --> 29:54.031
On the ringphone so she would
track me here to the buy more.

29:54.099 --> 29:55.232
It's a trap, my trap.

29:55.283 --> 29:57.001
You told sydney to go to the buy more?

29:59.788 --> 30:01.605
Oh, my god, it worked. They're here.

30:01.673 --> 30:02.956
Okay, grab casey

30:03.041 --> 30:04.708
And get up here so we can take them out.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.110
No, chuck, what are you, crazy?

30:07.629 --> 30:09.213
Not very smart, chuck.

30:09.264 --> 30:11.248
This is not how I do business.

30:11.316 --> 30:13.083
You start things on your own,

30:13.134 --> 30:14.952
You better be prepared to finish them...

30:15.020 --> 30:16.487
On your own.

30:16.554 --> 30:18.555
Good luck.

30:20.325 --> 30:21.591
He hung up on me.

30:21.643 --> 30:22.776
What are you doing?

30:22.861 --> 30:24.261
Without us, he doesn't have a chance.

30:24.329 --> 30:25.646
He's gonna start to panic

30:25.730 --> 30:27.264
And then he's not gonna be
able to perform properly.

30:27.315 --> 30:28.999
Yeah, happens to lots of guys.

30:29.067 --> 30:30.651
Or so I hear.

30:30.735 --> 30:33.804
Besides, I'm kinda curious
about what his plan is.

30:33.872 --> 30:36.457
This isn't part of the plan.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.376
Oh, this is very, very bad.

30:53.258 --> 30:54.975
Chuck : Hello, sydney.

30:55.060 --> 30:58.462
Welcome to the burbank buy more.

30:58.513 --> 31:03.133
Please proceed directly
to the home theater room.

31:03.184 --> 31:04.134
Find him.

31:04.185 --> 31:06.103
I would suggest the best way

31:06.154 --> 31:07.654
Of getting to the home theater room

31:07.739 --> 31:10.407
Is through the mp3/... Aisle,

31:10.475 --> 31:12.309
But beware...

31:12.360 --> 31:14.862
You break it, you buy it.

31:17.365 --> 31:19.116
Hello, sir.

31:19.167 --> 31:20.617
Store's closed at the moment

31:20.668 --> 31:22.669
But if you want to come back in the morning,

31:22.754 --> 31:24.705
We'll be open around 10:00...

31:28.126 --> 31:29.493
You're signing his death warrant,

31:29.544 --> 31:30.677
You know that, don't you?

31:30.762 --> 31:32.729
Ye of little faith.

31:32.797 --> 31:34.014
This is crazy.

31:34.099 --> 31:36.500
I'm going in. So am I.

31:36.551 --> 31:39.186
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you two to stand down.

31:40.305 --> 31:41.522
I don't like guns much,

31:41.606 --> 31:43.240
But when necessary, I will use them.

31:46.778 --> 31:48.278
Finally, we meet.

31:48.346 --> 31:50.013
In an electronics store.

31:50.081 --> 31:53.550
Which is different.

31:53.618 --> 31:55.519
No matter.

31:55.587 --> 31:58.572
When we last chatted,
you mentioned a certain agent shaw.

31:58.656 --> 31:59.990
That's right.

32:00.041 --> 32:01.858
Because I'm the one who ended shaw's life,

32:01.910 --> 32:04.495
Not devon woodcomb. He was just a patsy.

32:04.562 --> 32:06.914
<i>You took out shaw?</i>

32:08.750 --> 32:12.136
Mr. Buy more?

32:12.203 --> 32:13.670
In a nutshell.

32:13.721 --> 32:15.105
I mean, that's kind of what happened.

32:15.173 --> 32:16.974
Well, then, if that's true,

32:17.041 --> 32:19.276
You won't have any problem
with glen and ian here.

32:20.395 --> 32:21.595
<i>Glen and ian?</i>

32:21.679 --> 32:23.213
Sure.

32:23.264 --> 32:25.582
Well, you should know,
glen and ian, ian and glen,

32:25.650 --> 32:28.352
That if you take one more step,
I will drop you.

32:30.822 --> 32:33.073
Oh, come on, flash. Flash!

32:36.027 --> 32:39.112
Okay. Okay, now I'm angry.

32:39.197 --> 32:42.332
I'm angry and in a great deal of pain.

32:44.469 --> 32:47.838
Oh. Oh.

32:47.905 --> 32:49.339
Oh...

32:56.631 --> 32:58.599
Get him.

32:59.551 --> 33:01.251
That was his plan?

33:01.302 --> 33:03.437
You know what? I'm going in.
Shoot me if you have to.

33:03.521 --> 33:05.322
casey: Hey!

33:09.444 --> 33:11.094
You're fast.

33:11.145 --> 33:14.464
Something else you should
know about me-- I love guns.

33:17.368 --> 33:19.152
Good boy.

33:19.237 --> 33:21.271
¶ ¶

33:29.447 --> 33:32.165
Go! I got these guys.

33:40.892 --> 33:43.727
Check the cage.

33:50.768 --> 33:51.568
Oh!

34:38.949 --> 34:40.567
Stop! Do not move!

34:46.407 --> 34:48.725
Or what? Hmm?

34:48.793 --> 34:51.911
Please, just do what I say.

34:53.214 --> 34:54.748
Spies don't say please.

34:54.831 --> 34:57.367
Now, devon--

34:57.418 --> 34:59.920
He would have had a bullet
between my eyes by now.

35:00.004 --> 35:03.273
All right, fine, your choice-- live or die.

35:04.542 --> 35:06.593
That's better.

35:06.678 --> 35:08.095
What are you doing? Do not do that.

35:08.179 --> 35:09.379
<i>Do not do that!</i>

35:09.430 --> 35:11.014
It's just the phone.

35:13.184 --> 35:14.735
You do want it, don't you?

35:14.819 --> 35:17.554
Or if you can't think of a use for it,

35:17.605 --> 35:19.823
I'm sure I can.

35:19.890 --> 35:22.392
I can make a phone call and have

35:22.443 --> 35:23.910
50 operatives here.

35:24.962 --> 35:26.663
Don't make me shoot you.

35:28.199 --> 35:29.766
I don't think you can.

35:29.834 --> 35:31.251
Chuck!

35:46.851 --> 35:48.769
Like I said,

35:48.853 --> 35:50.787
I hate guns,

35:50.855 --> 35:53.156
But it pays to know how to use one.

36:04.911 --> 36:06.645
<i>I suppose congratulations
are in order, chuck. </i>

36:06.913 --> 36:08.130
Devon's identity has been contained.

36:08.215 --> 36:10.516
We got lucky this time, shaw.

36:11.034 --> 36:14.002
Yeah, and risked my family doing it.

36:15.505 --> 36:17.305
There's something you need
to know about me, shaw.

36:17.373 --> 36:19.408
There's nothing in my life

36:19.475 --> 36:22.310
That I care about more than
my friends and my family.

36:22.378 --> 36:25.230
Of course, I don't expect
you to understand that.

36:25.314 --> 36:26.548
Being the spy that you are,

36:26.599 --> 36:28.150
I'm sure that you don't care about anybody.

36:28.217 --> 36:29.985
Families and friends make us vulnerable.

36:30.052 --> 36:32.954
Make us unable to pull the trigger.

36:33.022 --> 36:36.525
And that puts everyone
in even greater danger.

36:36.592 --> 36:38.577
Just ask your partner here.

36:40.630 --> 36:43.532
She'll tell you the same thing.

36:45.251 --> 36:47.836
Sometimes it helps to know that
you've got something to lose.

37:17.483 --> 37:18.767
¶ morgan! ¶

37:18.835 --> 37:23.905
¶ come out and play-ay! ¶

37:23.973 --> 37:25.791
¶ morgan! ¶

37:26.876 --> 37:29.995
¶ come out and play-ay! ¶

37:32.248 --> 37:34.166
Big mike: Grimes!

37:34.250 --> 37:36.117
Get over here!

37:38.588 --> 37:41.389
You have got to get your
house in order, son.

37:41.457 --> 37:42.891
I know. I know I do.

37:42.959 --> 37:44.826
I-I just... I don't... I don't get it.

37:44.894 --> 37:46.511
I thought we were all friends here.

37:46.596 --> 37:48.063
You ain't.

37:48.130 --> 37:49.931
First rule of big mike management:

37:49.999 --> 37:51.733
You can't be afraid

37:51.801 --> 37:53.635
To pull the trigger.

37:53.686 --> 37:56.188
Right?

37:56.272 --> 37:57.823
Pull the trigger.

37:57.907 --> 37:59.524
Right.

38:02.612 --> 38:04.830
Lester,

38:04.914 --> 38:06.998
You know,

38:07.083 --> 38:10.035
A wise man once told me that
you need to assess a problem

38:10.119 --> 38:11.152
And then attack it head-on.

38:11.204 --> 38:12.838
Hmm.

38:12.922 --> 38:15.373
You... Are a problem.

38:15.458 --> 38:16.675
Oh.

38:16.759 --> 38:18.376
Your behavior will no longer be tolerated.

38:18.461 --> 38:20.495
So, here are the first, second

38:20.546 --> 38:22.497
And third rules of the buy more.

38:22.548 --> 38:24.166
Do what you're told,

38:24.233 --> 38:26.518
Do it with respect, or...

38:26.602 --> 38:27.719
Or what?

38:27.804 --> 38:29.337
Hmm?

38:29.388 --> 38:31.056
You'll fight me?

38:34.510 --> 38:35.727
No, I'll fire you.

38:35.812 --> 38:37.229
You don't have the cojones.

38:37.313 --> 38:40.215
Yeah.

38:40.283 --> 38:41.015
No, you're fired.

38:41.067 --> 38:42.400
Pack your hard drives

38:42.485 --> 38:43.618
And get out of here.

38:43.686 --> 38:45.320
The rest of you, back to work.

38:45.371 --> 38:47.155
Morgan, morgan, morgan,
morgan, come on, man.

38:47.206 --> 38:48.790
Okay, look, hey.

38:48.858 --> 38:50.292
We're just having a little fun.

38:50.359 --> 38:51.459
Okay? I take it back.

38:51.527 --> 38:53.245
I take it back. Good-bye, lester.

38:53.329 --> 38:55.363
Dude, don't do this. Don't do this, okay?

38:55.431 --> 38:58.917
You know I need this job.
I got to get out of my mom's place.

38:59.001 --> 39:00.385
Hmm.

39:00.469 --> 39:02.203
For god's sake, man,
I've got nowhere else to go!

39:02.255 --> 39:03.438
I've got nowhere else to go!

39:06.642 --> 39:07.642
Yeah, okay, you're rehired.

39:09.011 --> 39:09.978
But you're on probation.

39:10.045 --> 39:11.062
Okay.

39:11.147 --> 39:12.731
Double-secret.

39:12.815 --> 39:14.149
Double-secret?!

39:16.102 --> 39:18.353
¶ ¶

39:20.239 --> 39:22.357
Strong.

39:22.408 --> 39:24.242
Real strong.

39:25.995 --> 39:27.445
Was that...?

39:27.530 --> 39:29.564
A bigger dog, a medium-sized dog.

39:29.615 --> 39:31.082
Bigger?

39:32.335 --> 39:35.003
¶ ¶

39:47.216 --> 39:48.967
Hey, chuck, can you grab that, dude?

39:49.051 --> 39:51.052
I'm-I'm wokin' and rollin' over here.

39:53.105 --> 39:55.724
Hi-dilly-ho, neighbors.

39:55.775 --> 39:57.091
Hi.

39:57.143 --> 39:58.860
Yeah, hey, guys.

39:58.928 --> 40:01.396
Welcome to our-- formerly-your-- home.

40:01.447 --> 40:02.697
I hope everybody is hungry,

40:02.765 --> 40:04.282
Because I made my teriyaki surprise.

40:04.367 --> 40:07.285
The surprise is the teriyaki.

40:07.370 --> 40:09.871
Think I've had enough surprises lately.

40:09.939 --> 40:11.156
Oh, devon, stop it.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.458
I'm sure we'll love it, morgan.

40:13.542 --> 40:15.543
Mostly sure.

40:15.611 --> 40:17.612
Hey, uh, buddy,

40:17.663 --> 40:20.332
That thing that we were dealing with?

40:21.651 --> 40:22.751
It's been taken care of.

40:22.802 --> 40:23.885
We caught her.

40:23.953 --> 40:25.971
Everything's gonna be just fine.

40:27.456 --> 40:28.890
Oh.

40:28.958 --> 40:31.092
There... There it is. That's enough of that.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.727
Hey, what-what am I,
chopped scallions over here?

40:32.795 --> 40:35.680
There's no love for buy more's
new assistant manager, or...?

40:35.765 --> 40:37.399
What? That's great.

40:37.466 --> 40:38.650
Congratulations.

40:38.734 --> 40:41.152
Assistant manager?

40:41.237 --> 40:42.904
Congratulations, buddy.

40:42.972 --> 40:44.572
Honey, you're hurting him. Put him down.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.658
Oh.

40:46.742 --> 40:49.110
Oh, uh, el, I hope you don't mind,
but I-I invited sarah,

40:49.161 --> 40:50.278
As well.

40:50.329 --> 40:51.746
Oh, really? I'll get the door.

40:53.582 --> 40:54.833
oh, casey, too.

40:54.917 --> 40:56.284
What?!

40:56.335 --> 40:57.953
Hi, ellie. Hi, sarah.

40:58.004 --> 40:59.487
Good to see you.

41:01.156 --> 41:02.323
Hello, ellie. Casey.

41:02.375 --> 41:04.209
You've had enough of that.

41:06.829 --> 41:08.263
What's with her?

41:08.330 --> 41:09.931
No idea.

41:09.999 --> 41:12.017
Hi.

41:12.101 --> 41:13.518
Hi.

41:13.602 --> 41:16.888
It wouldn't have been the
same without you, so,

41:16.973 --> 41:18.640
I'm really glad you made it.

41:18.691 --> 41:20.725
Me, too.
