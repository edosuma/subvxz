Ladies and gentlemen,
within this household,

00:36.050 --> 00:39.116
we find a normal,
everyday secret lab

00:39.150 --> 00:42.150
of a normal, everyday
boy genius.

00:42.183 --> 00:47.283
But we have taken
great pains to bring you
a sneak peek into...

Narrator:
In the lab of tomorrow,

00:56.200 --> 00:59.316
each member of the family
will have a secret lab,

00:59.350 --> 01:03.050
each equipped with its own
secret entrance.

01:03.083 --> 01:05.266
For dad...

01:05.300 --> 01:09.250
What kinds
of wondrous inventions
could dear old dad

01:09.283 --> 01:13.416
be conjuring up
in his lab of tomorrow?

01:14.233 --> 01:16.433
Some things never change.

01:16.466 --> 01:18.383
After a hard day's work,

01:18.416 --> 01:22.450
mom can sneak down into
the depths of her own
secret lab,

01:22.483 --> 01:26.350
where she'll most likely
work twice as hard.

01:26.383 --> 01:28.400
[Whirring]

01:39.250 --> 01:44.050
And to keep
that pesky sister out
of your own secret lab,

01:44.083 --> 01:48.333
we've devised a secret
lab entrance all her own.

01:48.366 --> 01:51.066
Ooh!

Narrator:
Tired of all that arduous
and laborsome wrenching?

02:15.183 --> 02:20.466
Well, in the future, it will all
be automated for you.

02:25.166 --> 02:30.350
Of course, it may require
a small amount of maintenance.

02:35.283 --> 02:36.316
[Dexter snoring]

02:36.350 --> 02:38.483
The scientist of tomorrow
can't be bothered

02:39.016 --> 02:41.266
wasting time with
the menial, mundane tasks

02:41.300 --> 02:44.166
of getting ready for work
in the morning.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.466
In the lab of the future,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.166
all of these tasks will be

03:44.416 --> 03:48.266
Moving on, telescope
technology
will have advanced to a level

03:48.300 --> 03:50.333
where we will finally
be able to see

03:50.366 --> 03:53.333
if there truly is life
on other planets.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.133
Wait. Focus.

Put out that light!

04:06.183 --> 04:09.383
Narrator: The function of using
your computer's mouse

04:09.416 --> 04:11.333
will be totally automated

04:11.366 --> 04:15.116
with the simple push
of a button.

04:16.016 --> 04:19.333
Uh, could you move it
to the left, please?

04:20.150 --> 04:23.333
A little bit more,
please?

04:24.283 --> 04:27.100
Not that far.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.033
And double-click.

04:36.283 --> 04:40.283
Narrator: Now, this truly is
the lab of tomorrow,

04:40.316 --> 04:43.166
modern in every way.

04:44.483 --> 04:46.266
In the lab of tomorrow,

04:46.300 --> 04:49.233
the modern problem
of arch rivals sneaking

04:49.266 --> 04:52.050
into your lab to wreak havoc
will be solved,

04:52.083 --> 04:57.316

to perform advanced
scientific experiments

05:52.400 --> 05:55.200
by themselves.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.150
Success.

06:00.333 --> 06:05.100
Tired of hot, sweaty armpits
from working?

06:05.200 --> 06:07.400
We tried crossing
a screen door and a lab coat

06:07.433 --> 06:10.283
to bring you the lab coat
of tomorrow.

06:10.316 --> 06:14.133

Bottles and beakers.

06:24.283 --> 06:25.250
Wait!

06:25.283 --> 06:27.166
That is not even funny!

06:27.200 --> 06:29.250
Narrator: Of course,
it's funny.

06:29.283 --> 06:31.116
I should know.

07:15.483 --> 07:17.266
Aaah!

07:17.300 --> 07:22.100
What are these strange
protrusions?

07:22.133 --> 07:24.266
I must investigate
immediately.

Dee Dee:
â™ª la la la la...

07:26.233 --> 07:28.050

Ok, Dee Dee,
way too much has
happened this morning,

07:42.333 --> 07:46.400
so please get out
of my laboratory!

07:46.433 --> 07:49.283
I have no time for
her foolishness today.

07:49.316 --> 07:53.333
But, Dexter,
I'm not in your labor--

08:01.016 --> 08:03.333
You've got chickenpox!

08:03.366 --> 08:05.100
Chickenpox?

08:05.133 --> 08:08.116
W-What is this pox
of a chicken?

08:08.150 --> 08:09.450
Poor Dexter.

08:09.483 --> 08:12.133
So knowledgeable
in science,

08:12.166 --> 08:15.000
but doesn't have
enough common sense

08:15.033 --> 08:18.233
to know what
chickenpox is.

08:19.033 --> 08:21.466
Well, a long time ago...

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
A group of evil,
contaminated chickens
escaped from jail...

08:28.233 --> 08:29.266
[Alarm blaring]

08:29.300 --> 08:33.216
And started to break
into children's houses,

08:33.250 --> 08:37.350
where they pecked away,
leaving huge, itchy pimples.

08:37.383 --> 08:39.416
And if you scratch them,

08:39.450 --> 08:44.350
you'll turn into an evil,
contaminated chicken.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.183
Are you crazy, wom--

08:51.033 --> 08:53.066
[clucks]

08:53.466 --> 08:55.100
Aaah!

08:55.133 --> 08:59.416
I do not want
to be an evil,
contaminated chicken.

08:59.450 --> 09:02.300
Then don't scratch!

09:04.183 --> 09:07.333
That seems simple enough.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.283
I better keep myself busy,
so as not to think
about the itching.

09:16.466 --> 09:18.016
Perfect.

09:18.050 --> 09:21.466
Now, how much dioxide petroleum
should I add?

09:22.000 --> 09:22.433
Hmm.

09:22.466 --> 09:26.383
What is the correct amount?

09:27.316 --> 09:29.050
Ha ha ha ha!

09:29.083 --> 09:30.316
Silly me!

09:30.350 --> 09:34.366

this whole time?

Aaah!

09:37.333 --> 09:39.033
Robot!

09:39.066 --> 09:41.383
More drastic measures
must be taken.

09:41.416 --> 09:43.016
Yes, Dexter?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.450
Robot, if you see me
scratch any part
of my body,

09:45.483 --> 09:50.016
I want you to zap me
with 100 watts of electrons.

09:50.050 --> 09:52.116
Yes, Dexter.

09:53.216 --> 09:56.050
I wasn't ready, robot.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.116
Yes, Dexter.

09:59.466 --> 10:02.283
I said I wasn't ready.

10:02.316 --> 10:04.383
Yes, Dexter.

10:05.283 --> 10:07.450
No, robot, wait!

10:08.316 --> 10:10.450
This is not working.

10:10.483 --> 10:13.383

Now, what the heck is it?

13:40.033 --> 13:44.300
It seems I have been working
so long I do not remember
what it does.

13:44.333 --> 13:48.133
Well, no doubt
something fantastic.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.433
I shall have to test it.

13:49.466 --> 13:52.383
Now, which one of you
would like to volunteer

13:52.416 --> 13:54.333
for today's experiment?

Wow, it is
a good thing
I missed.

14:34.133 --> 14:35.250
But if it did that

14:35.283 --> 14:37.450
to a piece
of lab equipment,

14:37.483 --> 14:39.000
yeesh!

14:39.033 --> 14:41.333
Ooh, and that smell!
Yuck!

14:41.366 --> 14:44.433
What hideous thing
have I created?

14:44.466 --> 14:48.000
If this were to fall
into the wrong hands,

14:48.033 --> 14:50.183
the effects could be
catastrophic!

14:50.216 --> 14:55.183
I must hide it somewhere,
safe from evil hands.

14:55.216 --> 14:58.033
Nope. Too obvious.

14:58.066 --> 14:59.000
Nope.

Nah, too tempting.

15:08.416 --> 15:10.050
There!

15:10.083 --> 15:13.116
No evildoer would think to look
in my little old room--

15:13.150 --> 15:16.050
let alone in a pile
of old toys.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.183
Whew!

15:17.216 --> 15:21.416
I feel a lot better now that
that's in a safe place.

No, but look
at how much money
I made.

And I am not for sale!

17:37.200 --> 17:38.450
Um, whatever, dude.

17:38.483 --> 17:41.450

to know if you had
the time.

[Sniffing]

18:02.350 --> 18:04.100
What's that smell?

18:04.133 --> 18:09.066
Well, whatever it is,
it's mine and I'm not
selling! You hear me?

18:15.416 --> 18:17.366
No!

18:17.400 --> 18:20.033
Nooooo...

18:28.200 --> 18:29.400
[Groans]

18:29.433 --> 18:30.266
Dex!

18:30.300 --> 18:32.166
Hey! Give it back!

18:32.200 --> 18:35.116
Must keep away
from mandark!

18:35.150 --> 18:36.116
Ha!

18:36.150 --> 18:39.433
I will not let you
use this for evil!

18:39.466 --> 18:42.216
Dexter, what has
gotten into you?

18:42.250 --> 18:45.233
This toy belongs
to mandark now.

18:45.266 --> 18:47.083
[Raspberry]

18:47.116 --> 18:50.150
But, mom,
it is not a toy!

18:50.183 --> 18:54.100
No buts!
Now, apologize!

18:55.366 --> 18:57.316
Nice hat.

18:58.266 --> 19:00.100
Dexter?

19:00.133 --> 19:02.200
Ok. All right.
Sorry.

19:02.233 --> 19:03.350
Apology accepted.

19:03.383 --> 19:05.200
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

19:05.233 --> 19:09.300
I'm going
to go home and play
with my new toy.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.250
[Laughing]

19:15.216 --> 19:19.266
Now, doesn't it feel good
to work out your problems?

19:19.300 --> 19:22.116
Yes, mom.

19:22.300 --> 19:27.366
Robo, prepare
for operation interception.

19:47.083 --> 19:50.033
Dexter: There's no use
hiding, mandark.

19:50.066 --> 19:52.333
I know you're here...

19:52.366 --> 19:54.416
Somewhere.

19:54.450 --> 19:56.416
Hmm.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.216
Heh heh heh heh!

20:00.250 --> 20:02.300
Aha!

20:16.483 --> 20:18.183
Where could he be?

20:18.216 --> 20:21.083
[Distant voice, indistinct]

20:24.166 --> 20:26.166
Mandark: ...Floating
like a sitting duck,

20:26.200 --> 20:28.266
unaware that just below
the surface lies

20:28.300 --> 20:30.383
captain mandark's sinister sub.

20:30.416 --> 20:33.016
[Mandark, indistinct]

20:33.050 --> 20:34.266
Prepare to suffer
a terrible fate,

20:34.300 --> 20:38.116
for, I mandark,
will soon unleash a plot
so diabolical,

20:38.150 --> 20:41.216
so despicable,
no one will escape
my wrath!

20:41.250 --> 20:43.350
[Laughing]

20:43.383 --> 20:45.150
That's it!

20:45.183 --> 20:46.216
Ha!

20:46.250 --> 20:49.033
Huh? Aaah!

20:52.166 --> 20:53.050
Mandark!

20:53.083 --> 20:54.116
Hand it over!

20:54.150 --> 20:57.283
Give it!
I bought that
fair and square!

20:57.316 --> 20:59.366
Well, I am
taking it back!

20:59.400 --> 21:02.400
[Both grunting]

21:02.433 --> 21:04.050
Fine!

21:04.083 --> 21:06.266
Take your stupid toy!

21:07.316 --> 21:09.233
Toy?

Dex?

21:31.200 --> 21:32.450
You look hideous!

21:32.483 --> 21:34.233
Well, at least
I do not have to worry

21:34.266 --> 21:37.483
about that mutation ray
getting into the wrong
hands anymore.

21:38.016 --> 21:42.166
Maybe not, but you're
in no condition to stop me
from destroying your lab.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.000
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

21:44.033 --> 21:47.183
By the way,
maybe you ought
to be taking a bath.

21:47.216 --> 21:49.200
You smell.
Mandark!

21:49.233 --> 21:54.016
Come back here!
I'm right behind you!

21:57.483 --> 21:58.466
Enter at your own peril,

21:59.000 --> 22:00.483
past the vaulted door,

22:01.016 --> 22:02.433
where impossible things

22:02.466 --> 22:04.266
