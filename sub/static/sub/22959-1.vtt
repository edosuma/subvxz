09:58.029 --> 09:59.362
- Is that right?
- Mm-hm.

09:59.364 --> 10:00.698
- Okay.
- So, what's up?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.031
You ain't gonna
order me nothin' to drink?

10:02.033 --> 10:03.269
Oh, I'm sorry love.

10:03.568 --> 10:06.538
- Yo, my man.
- Can I have a vodka and orange?

10:06.871 --> 10:08.372
Actually, make that a double.

10:08.573 --> 10:10.041
- You got it.
- Thank you.

10:10.542 --> 10:13.042
- So, what's good?
- Man, you tell me.

10:13.044 --> 10:14.111
Okay, don't tell me that.

10:14.346 --> 10:15.912
Hey, you used to hit
that right?

10:15.914 --> 10:18.549
She community property.
That jawn spread like butter.

10:19.017 --> 10:21.653
Yeah, I see. Nigga, look.
She over there dick riding

10:21.852 --> 10:23.387

from Quadir's crew.

10:24.557 --> 10:25.922
Everybody and their mama
from Philly

10:25.924 --> 10:28.226
up in this piece tonight,
even Fat Winston.

10:29.394 --> 10:30.826
You know his fat ass
always lookin'

10:30.828 --> 10:33.131
- for a new connect.
- And Quadir got that pure shit.

10:37.235 --> 10:38.669
Nigga, I know
Quadir ain't puttin'

10:38.671 --> 10:39.971
that fat ass nigga down.

10:40.304 --> 10:42.506
- Nigga, we bigger than Winston.
- Damn right.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.525
How ya doin', queen?

11:00.325 --> 11:01.660
You tell me, king.

11:01.993 --> 11:03.161
This queen got a name?

11:03.595 --> 11:05.594
Oh, so, we just... we gon' play
this game all night?

11:05.596 --> 11:07.430
- I mean, I can go all night.
- I bet you could.

11:07.432 --> 11:08.699
All night.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.802
See look at this, look at that.
See that?

11:11.102 --> 11:13.103
All these distractions,
pretty distraction,

11:13.105 --> 11:14.671
pretty distraction,
pretty distraction.

11:14.673 --> 11:17.775
All I seem to be able
to focus on is you.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.576
- Really?
- Yes. So, let's make a deal.

11:20.578 --> 11:21.978
I guess your name right,

11:21.980 --> 11:23.479
you leave with me right now.

11:23.481 --> 11:24.781
- No questions asked.
- That's not gonna happen.

11:24.783 --> 11:26.619
Gena, how you doin'?

11:27.586 --> 11:28.954
- How do you know my name?
- Rollins, right?

11:30.288 --> 11:31.289
Philly, right?

11:32.024 --> 11:33.522
Okay, this is too weird
for words.

11:33.524 --> 11:34.991
How do you know my name
and where I'm from?

11:34.993 --> 11:36.459
So, you're saying I won?
Did I get it?

11:36.461 --> 11:37.763
- I mean...
- Where I'm from,

11:38.029 --> 11:39.429
- you make a deal...
- Gena!

11:39.431 --> 11:41.330
- ...you stick to your deal.
- Really? Does it?

11:41.332 --> 11:42.531
- Gena!
- We should be out...

11:42.533 --> 11:43.701
Yo, what's up, Quadir?

11:44.202 --> 11:46.036
What's up, big homey?
What you doin' up this way?

11:46.038 --> 11:47.906
Hey, brother,
I don't know you.

11:48.306 --> 11:50.776
Let me make the introduction.
This Jerrell Jackson,

11:51.143 --> 11:53.142
this Rich Green,
and they homegirl...

11:53.144 --> 11:54.078
Aubrey.

11:54.679 --> 11:56.345
They makin' a few moves
in the streets.

11:56.347 --> 11:58.248
A few moves?
I don't know who you talkin' to.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.581
- No, no, no.
- I'm talkin' to you.

11:59.583 --> 12:00.983
- Like I said, a few.
- No, it's all respect.

12:00.985 --> 12:02.584
I don't understand
what this conversation's about.

12:02.586 --> 12:04.020
We respect what you're doin'
in the streets. We just wanted

12:04.022 --> 12:05.357
- to say what's up.
- I'm sorry, I don't know...

12:06.325 --> 12:07.459
what it is you think I do,

12:07.893 --> 12:09.961
but, ay, it was a pleasure
to meet you. <i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>

12:10.562 --> 12:11.830
All right? Turn up.

12:12.062 --> 12:13.064
Easy.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.467
I'm so over it.

12:17.201 --> 12:19.270
You rushed me to come here,
now you rushin' me to leave.

12:19.504 --> 12:21.905
- Chill, we not leavin'.
- Then why are we outside?

12:21.907 --> 12:23.776
We waitin' on Rasun
and Quadir to come out.

12:24.009 --> 12:25.076
But you could've seen them
inside.

12:25.344 --> 12:27.213
Mm-mm, then Rich Green
would've seen me.

12:28.413 --> 12:30.012
- Who is Rich Green?
- Did you see

12:30.014 --> 12:31.081
the scary lookin' guy
with the beard?

12:31.383 --> 12:33.018
Girl, every guy in Philly
got a beard.

12:33.217 --> 12:35.752
True.
Well, I used to fuck Rich Green

12:35.754 --> 12:37.288
and I don't want Rasun to know.

12:37.755 --> 12:39.290
Rasun and Quadir are friends.

12:39.490 --> 12:40.725
That's why you gave him my shit.

12:41.759 --> 12:44.594
Now, I told him your name.
I can't help he texted Quadir.

12:44.596 --> 12:46.499
Come on, here they come.

12:48.566 --> 12:50.099
- Just let them take us.
- I gotta go to church

12:50.101 --> 12:51.401
in the morning, why you...

12:51.403 --> 12:52.469
Hey, so they about to bring
the car around.

12:52.471 --> 12:53.902
What y'all tryin' to get into?

12:53.904 --> 12:55.139
Ay, man, you know
what they tryin' to get into.

12:55.572 --> 12:57.406
- I say we ride home with y'all.
- I like that.

12:57.408 --> 12:59.108
Because it's too late
to get on the train, right?

12:59.110 --> 13:00.377
It's too late, it's too late.

13:00.379 --> 13:01.846
You famous, motherfucker!

13:06.317 --> 13:08.853
Yeah.
Teach yo' ass, nigga.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.466
Oh my God,
this is so good.

13:23.201 --> 13:25.504
Yeah, nothing works up
an appetite like being shot at.

13:27.739 --> 13:29.774
You know,
Gena really loves lobster.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.641
- Is that right?
- Mm-hm.

13:31.643 --> 13:33.545
Well, you should, uh,
come down to...

13:34.044 --> 13:35.680
to the restaurant.
My chef makes a...

13:36.980 --> 13:38.283
wonderful lobster.

13:38.883 --> 13:41.217
- You've got your own restaurant?
- Who, my man Qua?

13:41.219 --> 13:42.786
He got the hottest restaurant
in the city.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.355
Oh, we already in there.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.725
- Ain't that right, Gena?
- Yeah, maybe.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.796
Mm. I gotta go
to the ladies' room, like, now.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.498
- Gena?
- I'm good.

13:53.697 --> 13:54.667
I gotta go, too.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.467
Okay.

14:22.594 --> 14:24.427
Why does it gotta to be
so much killin' out there?

14:24.429 --> 14:25.896
Why you talking to me
like I'm responsible?

14:26.096 --> 14:27.131
I'm just sayin'.

14:27.932 --> 14:28.901
Sorry.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.869
- It's crazy to me.
- It is.

14:31.101 --> 14:32.502
What are you gonna do about it?

14:32.504 --> 14:33.869
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

14:33.871 --> 14:35.271
I don't know,
that's up to the politicians.

14:35.273 --> 14:37.272
- I'm still in school.
- Oh, you in school?

14:37.274 --> 14:38.910
- What you majorin' in?
- English literature.

14:39.311 --> 14:41.611
- You tryin' to be a writer?
- I am a writer.

14:41.613 --> 14:43.046
- Let me read some of your work.
- I'm sorry,

14:43.048 --> 14:44.513
I don't let strangers
read my work.

14:44.515 --> 14:46.016
You do know
that when you sit down

14:46.018 --> 14:47.349
and break bread with somebody,

14:47.351 --> 14:48.651
technically you're not
a stranger anymore?

14:48.653 --> 14:50.554
Listen, Quadir, you seem
like a really nice guy.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.321
I appreciate dinner.
You taking us home

14:52.323 --> 14:53.757
is really nice,
but I know what you do.

14:53.759 --> 14:54.925
- Oh, do you?
- Yes,

14:54.927 --> 14:56.358
- and I've been there before.
- Mm.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.993
And I know most girls
would just take the money.

14:57.995 --> 14:59.594
So, you think...
you think... you think

14:59.596 --> 15:02.199
that I care more about what's
in between your legs than...

15:02.500 --> 15:04.499
Come on, we both know
you're not interested

15:04.501 --> 15:06.036
in reading my work.
All you wanna do

15:06.038 --> 15:08.740
is hit and that's good for you.
But, that's not who I am.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.475
Okay?

15:10.674 --> 15:12.377
Thank you for keeping it 100.
I appreciate that.

15:15.113 --> 15:18.784
I don't hide what I do.
It was a conscious decision.

15:19.551 --> 15:22.754
I'm a young, black,
successful criminal.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.389
Yeah, that's what I do.

15:25.756 --> 15:27.025
That's not who I am.

15:28.091 --> 15:30.193
I love reading.
I love music.

15:30.195 --> 15:31.530
I love art, anything that'll...

15:32.998 --> 15:36.936
stimulate my intellect.
So, I... I... apologize.

15:38.168 --> 15:39.737
I assumed you being a writer...

15:41.373 --> 15:43.208
possibly written something
that could do that.

15:53.418 --> 15:54.753
What's up, y'all good?

15:56.721 --> 15:57.689
We good?

16:14.239 --> 16:15.738
All right, y'all,
I love you girl.

16:15.740 --> 16:17.175
- I'll call you later.
- All right, love you.

16:19.910 --> 16:21.012
Hey, Quadir.

16:22.246 --> 16:23.813
You make sure
you get her home safe,

16:23.815 --> 16:25.781
you hear me?

16:25.783 --> 16:27.449
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

16:27.451 --> 16:28.651
- Be good to her.
- All right.

16:28.653 --> 16:30.122
Please.

16:54.178 --> 16:55.813
- Are you Muslim?
- Yeah,

16:56.014 --> 16:58.750
I don't practice the tenants
like you supposed to,

16:58.950 --> 17:00.319
but I'm Muslim.

17:00.552 --> 17:03.388
I wrote about Malcolm X's
haj to Mecca in my blog.

17:03.654 --> 17:05.022
Very courageous man.

17:07.659 --> 17:10.358
That's crazy,
because I'm a huge fan

17:10.361 --> 17:11.760
of Malcolm X

17:11.762 --> 17:13.996
and his philosophies
on economic independence.

17:13.998 --> 17:15.933
Actually, let me... let me...
let me... see your phone.

17:16.468 --> 17:17.435
Okay.

17:19.237 --> 17:20.571
I'ma put my number...

17:21.640 --> 17:23.873
in here and you can call me
and we can talk about it.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.540
That was smooth

17:25.541 --> 17:27.044
how you did that.
You accidentally on purpose

17:27.278 --> 17:28.844
called your phone
so you can get my number?

17:32.784 --> 17:34.686
Can you drop me off
at this store over here?

17:42.161 --> 17:43.595
I forgot to get something
for Gah-Git.

17:43.795 --> 17:44.930
What the hell is a Gah-Git?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.462
- Gah-Git.
- Gah-Git.

17:46.464 --> 17:48.163
- My grandmother.
- Oh.

17:48.165 --> 17:49.699
So, when we were younger
she would say,

17:49.701 --> 17:51.102
"Gah git" this, "Gah git" that,

17:51.635 --> 17:53.738
and so we've been callin' her
that ever since.

17:54.071 --> 17:56.807
I can wait, make sure
you get home safe.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.743
That was sweet, but I'm okay.

17:59.178 --> 18:00.545
Gah-Git sees me
come home with you?

18:01.512 --> 18:02.845
She'll send
the whole praise team

18:02.847 --> 18:04.648
to lay hands on me.

18:04.915 --> 18:06.117
We don't need that.

18:07.719 --> 18:08.754
Thank you.

18:09.386 --> 18:10.254
You're welcome.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.609
What's up, Cherelle?

18:32.042 --> 18:33.778
It's damn near morning.
What happened?

18:34.078 --> 18:35.212
Nah, I was knocked out.

18:35.547 --> 18:36.980
I been waitin' all night
for you.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.216
I had a long day.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.418
Let me call you tomorrow.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.989
Oh, wow.

18:48.692 --> 18:49.894
You famous, motherfucker.

18:51.362 --> 18:53.432
Get your ass uptown, nigga.

18:54.165 --> 18:56.634
You owe us money,
you pay the consequences.

18:58.469 --> 18:59.804
You fucking bitch.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.042
You better run, hoe.

19:05.509 --> 19:07.045
Faster!

19:15.988 --> 19:18.321
<i>This call
may be monitored or recorded.</i>

19:19.691 --> 19:21.457
Now, now, now,
don't start that Spanish shit.

19:21.459 --> 19:23.293
I wanna talk to somebody
that speaks English.

19:23.295 --> 19:24.362
English!

19:24.796 --> 19:26.328
<i>You may respond

Two, one, five...

19:45.148 --> 19:46.817
<i>I think you said,
"I don't know."</i>

19:47.018 --> 19:48.185
- <i>Is that right?</i>
- No!

19:48.519 --> 19:52.289
I said two, one, five.

19:52.523 --> 19:53.891
<i>Let's continue.</i>

19:54.125 --> 19:56.092
<i>In a few words, tell me
what you're calling about.</i>

19:56.094 --> 19:58.126
I'm callin'
about your fucked-up ass

19:58.128 --> 20:00.231
customer service,
bitch ass machine.

20:02.733 --> 20:04.502
Pitchin' for the Phillies now?
The hell is wrong with you?

20:06.003 --> 20:07.271
I was tryin' to pay my bills,

20:07.605 --> 20:09.638
but now they always want you
to talk to some damn machine.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.173
Gettin' on my nerves.
What you doin' here?

20:12.175 --> 20:14.477
I was in the neighborhood,
so I thought I'd stop by.

20:14.479 --> 20:15.547
What's wrong?

20:16.147 --> 20:18.750
I got a get-the-fuck-out
eviction notice.

20:19.183 --> 20:22.551
Been payin' my damn mortgage
for 27 years on time.

20:22.553 --> 20:23.885
Three years to go,

20:23.887 --> 20:25.189
how they gon' send me
a notice like that?

20:26.824 --> 20:28.357
Shoog, you had me worried
over here. I got you,

20:28.359 --> 20:29.557
- don't worry. Calm down.
- No, no, no, no.

20:29.559 --> 20:30.826
I ain't like that.

20:30.828 --> 20:32.294
Everybody always come in
with some stories,

20:32.296 --> 20:33.461
askin' for moneys.

20:33.463 --> 20:34.497
- Shoog. Shoog.
- I got mine.

20:34.499 --> 20:35.567
- Shoog,
- You know I can hold it.

20:35.866 --> 20:37.001
Sit down.

20:37.602 --> 20:38.570
First of all...

20:39.570 --> 20:41.872
you're not everybody,
you're family.

20:42.473 --> 20:44.108
If I have a dollar,
you have a dollar.

20:44.476 --> 20:45.777
- These all your bills?
- Yeah, why?

20:45.977 --> 20:47.242
- All of 'em?
- Yeah.

20:47.244 --> 20:48.344
I'm gonna take 'em
to my accountant.

20:48.346 --> 20:49.577
Make sure he take care
of 'em.

20:49.579 --> 20:50.548
You don't have to
call nobody ever.

20:51.048 --> 20:52.248
Word?

20:52.250 --> 20:53.584
Here's some
walkin' around money.

20:54.085 --> 20:56.555
Go get yourself somethin' nice,
get somethin' for the kids.

20:57.989 --> 21:00.123
- Gimme some sugar.
- Aww, here ya go.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.724
I don't know what I would do
without you.

21:01.726 --> 21:03.426
I hear what you be
out here doing without me.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.963
Man, I hear
about your little hot pocket.

21:05.196 --> 21:07.764
You better clean that shit up.

21:08.199 --> 21:10.134
Hey, you know
this lady named Gah-Git?

21:10.433 --> 21:11.970
Gah-Git?

21:12.770 --> 21:14.770
Shoot, when I was a baby,
she was the one

21:14.772 --> 21:16.374
that introduced me
into these streets.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.744
That was before she found God
and got saved.

21:20.711 --> 21:22.346
What you asking
about Gah-Git for?

21:22.579 --> 21:24.212
She a little long
in the tooth for you.

21:24.214 --> 21:25.748
Nah, it's her granddaughter.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.982
You know, light-skin,
short hair, Gena Rollins.

21:27.984 --> 21:29.853
- Ah, little Gena?
- Yeah.

21:30.454 --> 21:31.722
She got you feeling
some kinda way?

21:31.923 --> 21:33.756
I mean I met her.
I read her blog.

21:33.758 --> 21:35.056
She's a writer.

21:35.058 --> 21:36.758
Yeah, well, you can write
that one off.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.026
Whoa, now you talkin',
now you gotta

21:38.028 --> 21:39.130
say somethin' that makes sense.

21:39.329 --> 21:40.798
You in the wrong line
of business, baby.

21:41.097 --> 21:43.667
She used to date this dealer
when she was a teenager.

21:44.035 --> 21:46.471
What was that boy's name?
Uh, Jamal.

21:46.771 --> 21:49.573
Yeah, they did the whole baller,
<i>Pretty Woman</i> thing.

21:50.307 --> 21:52.074
So, is she still with him?
What happened?

21:52.076 --> 21:55.277
Nope, he also did, Ike Turner

21:55.279 --> 21:57.014
beat the shit
outta yo ass thing, too.

21:57.214 --> 21:58.881
She already been
to the magic show,

21:58.883 --> 22:00.083
seen all the tricks.

22:00.085 --> 22:01.620
Her mama died
of a drug overdose.

22:03.421 --> 22:05.587
- You want some breakfast?
- No, I'm good, I'm all right.

22:05.589 --> 22:08.059
- I gotta get out of here.
- You always runnin'.

22:09.626 --> 22:11.695
- Time is money, Shoog.
- Mm-hm.

22:11.962 --> 22:13.065
Love you boy.

22:13.765 --> 22:15.831
<i>Bria, you been playin'
on my computer again?</i>

22:15.833 --> 22:18.500
Uh-uh, but this salad
about to be good. Gah-Git,

22:18.502 --> 22:19.834
you know there's other stuff
you could use

22:19.836 --> 22:22.007
besides pork
to make collard greens, right?

22:22.339 --> 22:23.441
Like what, Bria?

22:23.875 --> 22:25.843
Well, they got this stuff
called smoked black pepper.

22:26.044 --> 22:27.477
- Gena, tell her.
- Mm-mm,

22:27.479 --> 22:28.811
I'm over here
tryin' to get ahead

22:28.813 --> 22:30.848
on my homework, so I can
relax on Spring Break.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.783
Well, there's nothing that can
replace meat perfectly,

22:33.785 --> 22:35.651
but the smoked black pepper
is good.

22:35.653 --> 22:37.187
- Smoked black pepper, huh?
- Yup.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.455
- Did you get some?
- No,

22:38.457 --> 22:39.855
but they got it
at the health food store.

22:39.857 --> 22:41.190
Oh,
and you didn't bring none home?

22:41.192 --> 22:42.658
Now, you know I ain't got
no job, Gah-Git.

22:42.660 --> 22:44.093
Well, then, how you gon'
tell me how to cook

22:44.095 --> 22:45.628
if you ain't prepared to buy it?

22:45.630 --> 22:47.962
- Because, I'm just sayin'.
- Say it when you get a job.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.069
What you smirkin' for?

22:51.303 --> 22:52.470
- What?
- I saw you comin' in here

22:52.836 --> 22:53.971
- early this mornin'.
- Gah-Git,

22:54.172 --> 22:55.638
I was going to get you...

22:55.640 --> 22:58.207
I ain't said nothin',
'cause I saw you strugglin'

22:58.209 --> 23:00.912
to stay awake when Rev
was preaching his sermon.

23:01.112 --> 23:02.814
Figured that was
punishment enough.

23:03.748 --> 23:06.683
Now, don't let it happen
no more, you understand me?

23:07.085 --> 23:08.952
- Yes, ma'am.
- 'Cause the only place

23:09.153 --> 23:10.755
that's open after midnight...

23:11.255 --> 23:14.222
A man wants to go
is between a woman's legs.

23:14.224 --> 23:15.394
Don't y'all ever forget it.

23:24.902 --> 23:26.270
Well, Hello.

23:27.705 --> 23:30.474
Oh, child what is that smell?

23:30.775 --> 23:32.040
Hey, y'all!

23:32.042 --> 23:34.009
- Hey, Sahirah.
- Hey, baby.

23:34.011 --> 23:35.012
Girl.

23:37.381 --> 23:38.583
Mm-hm.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.585
So, how'd it go with Quadir?

23:40.852 --> 23:42.383
It was cool.
He dropped me off.

23:42.385 --> 23:43.753
- That's it?
- Girl,

23:43.755 --> 23:45.457
Gah-Git know
I was out last night.

23:46.257 --> 23:47.625
Oh, shit, my bad.

23:47.858 --> 23:50.760
It was worth it, though, G.
Quadir is paid.

23:51.061 --> 23:53.161
Not only is he makin'
money in the streets,

23:53.163 --> 23:54.662
but he's got a bunch
of businesses.

23:54.664 --> 23:56.065
- He's a millionaire.
- Girl,

23:56.067 --> 23:58.068
I had my share
of drug deal millionaires.

23:58.568 --> 24:02.473
Please! Jamal
wasn't nobody's millionaire.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.408
Anyway.

24:04.608 --> 24:06.910
So, Quadir is supposed
to be seeing some girl

24:06.912 --> 24:08.846
named Cherelle
who lives up in Germantown.

24:09.047 --> 24:10.546
Well, Good for her.
She can have him.

24:10.548 --> 24:11.615
I feel you.

24:12.416 --> 24:14.251
Besides, you gon' be
a boss ass bitch

24:14.484 --> 24:16.520
with your writin' and shit.

24:17.288 --> 24:18.756
That's why I got you this.

24:19.057 --> 24:22.660
- Aww, really?
- Yeah.

24:22.926 --> 24:24.128
Let me see what this is.

24:25.762 --> 24:26.932
I love you.

24:29.134 --> 24:32.804
Look, G, on the real, none of us
had it easy comin' up.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.307
I mean, between your momma
and my daddy,

24:36.207 --> 24:37.774
you still got your dreams, G,

24:37.776 --> 24:39.442
and that's more
than most of us got.

24:39.943 --> 24:42.379
But, trust and believe
you always got me.

24:43.413 --> 24:45.482
And don't be spending
your money on me either.

24:45.950 --> 24:48.450
I got a couple coin from Rasun

24:48.452 --> 24:50.788
and I couldn't help
but buy it for you.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.990
Rasun know he contributed
to this?

24:53.824 --> 24:55.657
Not unless he saw me
go through his wallet

24:55.659 --> 24:59.431
- while he was sleep.
- Girl, you are a mess.

25:00.632 --> 25:01.799
Gena.

25:02.534 --> 25:03.701
Baby, it's dinner time.

25:04.134 --> 25:06.002
Why don't you set
a place for Sahirah.

25:06.237 --> 25:08.638
Thank you, Gah-Git.
I appreciate you.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.338
Sugar, you show up
every Sunday for dinner.

25:10.340 --> 25:12.076
Why would this Sunday
be any different?

25:12.611 --> 25:14.376
I just wish you
would show up early

25:14.378 --> 25:16.346
so you can go
to the services with us.

25:17.115 --> 25:18.480
You know, I'm workin' on that?

25:18.482 --> 25:21.752
- Hmm, yeah.
- I promise, I am.

25:28.558 --> 25:30.459
See right there?
I don't like that.

25:55.185 --> 25:57.655
Excuse me, miss.
Are you Gena Rollins?

25:58.522 --> 25:59.788
Yes,

25:59.790 --> 26:01.391
but I'm kind of runnin' late
for class.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.661
Is there somethin'
I can help you with?

26:15.707 --> 26:18.543
Tell Quadir I said thank you,
but I'm okay.

26:39.763 --> 26:40.898
Yeah.

26:42.932 --> 26:44.935
What the fuck you mean
she didn't get in the car?

26:47.337 --> 26:48.873
All right, all right.

26:49.574 --> 26:50.574
Listen...

26:51.174 --> 26:52.943
text me as soon
as she leaves class, all right?

26:53.676 --> 26:54.778
As soon as.

26:55.212 --> 26:56.146
All right.

26:57.948 --> 26:58.950
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>

26:59.182 --> 27:00.518
<i>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

27:01.352 --> 27:02.683
We good down in Chestnut Hill?

27:02.685 --> 27:06.054
Washington Crossing,
Villanova, Moorestown,

27:06.056 --> 27:07.788
- and Penn Valley are all good.
- Good, good, good.

27:07.790 --> 27:08.792
Ra, what we got?

27:09.426 --> 27:11.059
Yo, man, I got some chicks
up in Easttown

27:11.061 --> 27:12.862
that's ready to get down
and ready for that candy.

27:13.096 --> 27:14.663
All right, that sounds good.
Let Rasun handle that.

27:14.665 --> 27:16.065
- Take this to my mother's.
- She gon' ask me

27:16.067 --> 27:17.234
how come
you ain't bring it, man.

27:17.634 --> 27:19.235
She knows the answer, that's why
she won't ask no questions.

27:19.237 --> 27:20.704
Why the fuck
you asking questions?

27:21.571 --> 27:22.906
Man, I know y'all niggas think
I'm young

27:23.141 --> 27:25.276
and only do... runnin' errands,
but let me run. I'm ready!

27:26.509 --> 27:27.979
Yo, what's up, Mr. Richards?

27:28.913 --> 27:30.312
We're closed, gentlemen.

27:30.314 --> 27:31.449
Don't look that way to me.

27:31.749 --> 27:33.282
Y'all need some more security
up in this thang, man.

27:33.284 --> 27:34.583
Anybody can get up in this jawn.

27:34.585 --> 27:37.055
Trust and believe,
we're secure my nigga.

27:39.856 --> 27:40.857
Somethin' funny?

27:41.459 --> 27:42.958
Nah, I mean that's cute.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.028
My little niece
got the same one.

27:44.295 --> 27:46.131
Hilarious. What's your name?
Is it Gerald?

27:46.431 --> 27:48.132
Gerald, right?
Let me holla at ya, man.

27:48.432 --> 27:49.467
Come have a seat.

27:58.509 --> 27:59.477
You...

28:00.411 --> 28:02.212
and I have yet to be...

28:03.080 --> 28:04.214
properly introduced.

28:04.448 --> 28:05.650
- You thirsty?
- Nah, I'm good.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.285
But you sure are
actin' thirsty.

28:12.256 --> 28:13.788
I'm not trying to act all joe
and shit,

28:13.790 --> 28:15.524
but everybody knows
that you're big time

28:15.526 --> 28:16.826
and I wanna work with big time.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.227
You've got the connects
to quality,

28:18.229 --> 28:19.396
so that makes you big time.

28:19.663 --> 28:22.066
I'ma keep it 1,000
with you, James.

28:22.666 --> 28:24.868
I do not like when people
try to impress me.

28:25.236 --> 28:26.501
A lot of people talk that talk,

28:26.503 --> 28:27.902
but me and my crew,
we're showin' you

28:27.904 --> 28:29.471
that we're the hottest thing
in these streets.

28:29.473 --> 28:31.907
I don't work in the streets.
Does this look like the streets?

28:31.909 --> 28:33.843
You think we can't move
how you move?

28:33.845 --> 28:36.045
I don't know, you famous.
Like your man said, you famous.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.082
You wanna be a star?
I don't wanna be a star.

28:38.415 --> 28:39.451
Huh?

28:42.385 --> 28:45.022
That move your man Rich pulled
at the club the other night?

28:45.655 --> 28:46.825
Noisy.

28:48.224 --> 28:49.557
I don't do noisy.

28:49.559 --> 28:51.495
Nah, man, Rich is young.

28:53.196 --> 28:54.998
- We respect you.
- It's not a no...

28:56.032 --> 28:57.167
but it's not a yes.

28:58.368 --> 29:00.504
Let's give it a couple months,
let things smooth out.

29:03.574 --> 29:04.776
I see you, Jerrell.

29:07.244 --> 29:08.378
We'll work somethin' out.

29:11.915 --> 29:13.250
- That's fair.
- Fair is fair.

29:13.683 --> 29:16.754
- And you're the boss, I get it.
- You're tryin' to be a boss.

29:17.387 --> 29:18.490
I get it.

29:21.925 --> 29:23.660
And we have been
introduced before.

29:36.807 --> 29:40.478
<i>I stare in your eyes
and the world disappears.</i>

29:41.244 --> 29:44.481
<i>Leaving us together,
so no one can see.</i>

29:45.482 --> 29:48.318
<i>Your body moves closer
so you're next to me.</i>

29:49.220 --> 29:52.155
<i>Your fingers unbutton
and take off my clothes.</i>

29:52.890 --> 29:56.794
<i>Your hands moving all over
from my head to my toes.</i>

29:57.428 --> 30:00.331
<i>Without delay,
you start to play.</i>

30:04.734 --> 30:06.002
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>

30:07.037 --> 30:09.705
- You just don't quit do you?
- Man, what would the fun

30:09.707 --> 30:11.440
- be in that?
- Oh. So, what? You just thought

30:11.442 --> 30:12.741
you would send a car,
I'd skip class

30:12.743 --> 30:13.742
get in, and, what, we'd go...

30:13.744 --> 30:14.811
- to Atlantic City?
- I did.

30:15.179 --> 30:16.510
Spend some money, have some fun,
and I'd throw my panties

30:16.512 --> 30:17.813
- in the air in gratitude?
- I actually like

30:17.815 --> 30:19.146
- the panties in the air part.
- I bet you do.

30:19.148 --> 30:20.649
I bet you could write
a book on it.

30:20.651 --> 30:22.485
- I've had my experiences.
- I'm sorry to disappoint,

30:22.487 --> 30:24.286
but I'm not interested
in being your experiment.

30:24.288 --> 30:25.688
I don't know,
I know it's loud in here,

30:25.690 --> 30:27.989
- but I said, experiences.
- I know what you said.

30:27.991 --> 30:29.458
You don't have to talk to me
like I'm a child.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.594
Take it easy.

30:31.761 --> 30:34.529
Relax, I'm not talking
to you like you're a child.

30:34.531 --> 30:37.401
I just like you and I think
you like me, too.

30:38.201 --> 30:39.236
How you know I like you?

30:39.936 --> 30:41.970
Well, you haven't slapped me
in the face,

30:41.972 --> 30:43.807
got up and left,
or asked me to leave.

30:45.308 --> 30:46.676
- I like you.
- Okay.

30:46.977 --> 30:49.013
- But this isn't gonna happen.
- Why?

30:49.279 --> 30:51.747
- I have been with guys like you.
- You have been with boys.

30:51.749 --> 30:52.980
You have never been with a man.

30:52.982 --> 30:54.283
I would never put my hands
on you.

30:54.285 --> 30:55.616
Oh, you did a credit check
on me?

30:55.618 --> 30:57.152
- Of course I did.
- I'm doing everything

30:57.154 --> 30:58.990
in my power
to get out of this life.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.728
- I don't trust myself with you.
- I don't trust myself with me.

31:04.095 --> 31:05.363
Welcome to the club.

31:06.530 --> 31:08.028
- You gotta meet my family.
- Of course.

31:08.030 --> 31:09.765
- They're everything to me.
- Family is everything.

31:09.767 --> 31:10.701
Okay, so dinner.

31:11.102 --> 31:12.767
- Dinner, at my restaurant.
- No, no, no.

31:12.769 --> 31:14.001
- Lobster.
- You gotta have dinner

31:14.003 --> 31:15.671
at my Gah-Git's house,
at her table,

31:15.673 --> 31:17.139
and you can bring some
of your friends

31:17.141 --> 31:18.109
- if you like.
- All right.

31:18.776 --> 31:20.009
Now get off my bus.

31:52.409 --> 31:53.611
I'll see you
in a little bit.

31:56.012 --> 31:58.081
- Who that?
- Aubrey.

31:58.548 --> 31:59.615
Yeah, I fucks with Aubrey.

31:59.817 --> 32:01.118
She always down for whatever,

32:01.586 --> 32:03.220
but she always gettin'
into it with somebody.

32:03.586 --> 32:04.821
She's gettin' us
that money, though.

32:05.255 --> 32:06.488
True.

32:06.490 --> 32:07.890
She remind me
of a white boy rapper,

32:07.892 --> 32:09.091
then when he get
to the nigga part,

32:09.093 --> 32:10.394
he always throw
a little extra on it.

32:10.661 --> 32:11.927
She cool, I got her.

32:11.929 --> 32:13.130
But niggas
be getting mad, though.

32:13.530 --> 32:15.432
And then she get mad
and wanna pop a motherfucker.

32:15.700 --> 32:16.801
How this money lookin'?

32:17.901 --> 32:19.003
We lookin' real good, Rich.

32:19.403 --> 32:21.239
We'd be lookin' better
if we had Winston's territory.

32:21.439 --> 32:22.506
Woo!

32:23.707 --> 32:26.276
Man, Jerrell, don't nobody
do it like you, bruh.

32:26.977 --> 32:28.477
Just make sure
you keep them bottles poppin'

32:28.479 --> 32:30.782
- when we get to the club.
- I got you.

32:31.949 --> 32:33.785
You gon' be up there
with Quadir, Rich.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.451
Watch.

32:35.719 --> 32:38.120
You know my manager,
he move Heaven and Earth

32:38.122 --> 32:40.423
every time Qua call
and make a reservation.

32:41.258 --> 32:42.924
It's like
he the black Bill Gates

32:42.926 --> 32:45.663
or some shit.
That nigga famous.

32:45.930 --> 32:47.532
And what about me?

32:48.665 --> 32:50.632
You? What you mean?

32:50.634 --> 32:52.036
The fuck your manager say
about me?

32:55.405 --> 32:58.241
Hey, look, man, you know Qua
on some next level shit, bruh.

32:58.575 --> 33:01.577
The boy come in,
buy the joint out, every time.

33:01.778 --> 33:03.347
Rich nigga problems.

33:22.732 --> 33:24.701
Come here, baby.
Come here.

33:26.336 --> 33:27.739
Go hook the boy up
with a nice cut.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.715
Over here.

33:38.615 --> 33:39.948
The real power is knowin'
when to leave

33:39.950 --> 33:41.182
a little somethin' on the table.

33:41.184 --> 33:42.752
I thought the real power
ran the table.

33:43.221 --> 33:45.353
Quadir is strong,
but we're stronger.

33:45.355 --> 33:47.557
There's nothin'
that he has that we can't take.

33:48.792 --> 33:50.959
Man, clean this shit up
and get these

33:50.961 --> 33:52.395
corny motherfuckers
up outta here.

33:52.963 --> 33:54.932
Y'all heard my man,
get the fuck out.

33:55.231 --> 33:57.132
<i>I went
to three different outlets</i>

33:57.134 --> 33:58.336
to find the chairs
that I wanted.

33:58.603 --> 34:00.304
All of them had pictures
on their websites,

34:00.537 --> 34:01.904
but none of them had them
in their warehouses.

34:02.471 --> 34:03.971
Then, when you get there,
they try to pawn

34:03.973 --> 34:05.075
something else off on you.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.709
I hate when people play
with my time like that.

34:07.711 --> 34:09.811
I wanted to beat the shit
out of them with a hammer.

34:09.813 --> 34:12.045
No, I feel you though,
because the right chairs

34:12.047 --> 34:14.349
are important if you openin' up
a hair salon.

34:14.351 --> 34:16.050
Out of all the...
I wouldn't think chairs.

34:16.052 --> 34:17.619
Why are chairs important?

34:17.621 --> 34:20.054
Have you ever sat
in the same spot for six hours

34:20.056 --> 34:21.722
while someone puts
a weave in your scalp?

34:21.724 --> 34:24.494
- No, I haven't.
- Trust me, chairs are important.

34:24.695 --> 34:26.494
Yeah, because of my charm,
she got the chairs

34:26.496 --> 34:29.429
she wanted and she didn't have
to kneecap a motherfucker.

34:31.034 --> 34:32.469
That's because the clerk
was a woman.

34:33.036 --> 34:34.501
Aww,
how long y'all been together?

34:34.503 --> 34:35.706
Six years.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.108
Yeah.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.210
All the girls were chasin'
after Tyrik,

34:39.577 --> 34:40.944
including this one singer.

34:41.177 --> 34:43.210
She even had
a recording contract.

34:43.213 --> 34:44.244
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:44.246 --> 34:45.545
Who is she?

34:45.547 --> 34:47.614
Doesn't matter,
'cause I'm the one who got him.

34:47.617 --> 34:49.516
- Yes, you did, baby.
- Sweet Lord, Jesus.

34:49.518 --> 34:52.089
I'm so happy everybody
is enjoyin' themselves.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.257
Oh, and Gah-Git,
this wine is so good.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.829
I can see that, baby.
You need to slow your roll.

34:59.128 --> 35:01.063
I appreciate you, uh,

35:01.898 --> 35:04.032
allowing me and my brother
into your home.

35:04.034 --> 35:06.066
- It means a lot.
- It's my pleasure.

35:06.068 --> 35:09.706
Gena spoke so highly of you,
I couldn't resist meeting you.

35:09.907 --> 35:11.108
Yeah, me... same here.

35:11.375 --> 35:15.211
Being our guest,
would you bless the food?

35:15.778 --> 35:18.280
Uh, with all due respect, uh,
in my religion,

35:18.282 --> 35:21.749
we don't... we just stay silent
before we eat.

35:21.751 --> 35:23.820
- What kind of religion is that?
- Muslim.

35:24.088 --> 35:25.589
Don't y'all pray,
like, five times a day?

35:25.922 --> 35:27.555
- Yeah.
- Well, that's nice,

35:27.557 --> 35:30.326
but in this house
we say our blessings

35:30.527 --> 35:32.996
- out loud before we eat.
- I am a guest in your home.

35:33.396 --> 35:34.664
Thank you. Bria?

35:41.103 --> 35:43.304
Heavenly Father,
we thank you for the gifts

35:43.306 --> 35:45.175
of your bounty
which we enjoy at this table.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.144
As you have provided
for us in the past,

35:47.411 --> 35:49.146
may you sustain us
throughout our lives.

35:49.346 --> 35:51.481
We also thank you
for blessing us with the friends

35:51.748 --> 35:54.518
and family that have gathered
to take part in your gifts.

35:54.818 --> 35:56.854
May we never forget the needy
and those in want.

35:57.353 --> 35:59.221
Jesus's name we pray, amen.

35:59.456 --> 36:00.688
Amen.

36:00.690 --> 36:02.058
- Let's eat.
- Ready.

36:03.393 --> 36:04.661
Strange.

36:04.961 --> 36:06.360
<i>I know you've
never been with a big man</i>

36:06.362 --> 36:08.796
<i>like me. Tell you the truth,
you want lies,</i>

36:08.798 --> 36:09.965
<i>I'm not here for your lies.</i>

36:10.166 --> 36:11.999
<i>All night, all night long.</i>

36:12.001 --> 36:13.336
<i>I promise you. Come right now</i>

36:13.637 --> 36:16.774
and I'll show you.
Dick stay hard like Rottweiler,

36:16.974 --> 36:18.475
Yes, I'm foreign, I'm blunt.

36:18.842 --> 36:21.644
I's a grown man and I will
tell you everything right now.

36:22.179 --> 36:23.912
Come on, spontaneous, that's me.

36:23.914 --> 36:24.781
Hey, yo!

36:25.782 --> 36:29.353
Who the fuck pushin'
this fly ass Benz up front?

36:29.920 --> 36:30.954
Oh, that's mine, man.

36:31.188 --> 36:33.155
You like that?
We call her midnight pussy.

36:33.489 --> 36:35.492
The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice, huh?

36:35.860 --> 36:37.825
Nigga, do you know I push
the same bitch?

36:37.827 --> 36:38.996
Same color and everything.

36:39.195 --> 36:40.730
Oh yeah, who are you?

36:40.963 --> 36:42.666
You somethin' special, my nigga?

36:45.534 --> 36:47.068
Hey yo, brother,
you mind if I holla

36:47.070 --> 36:48.271
at my man, Winston,
for a second?

36:48.639 --> 36:50.304
- Give me a minute.
- You wanna come, right,

36:50.306 --> 36:52.074
yeah? You spend a lot
of time on your phone.

36:52.309 --> 36:53.710
This nigga gon'
learn today.

36:54.077 --> 36:55.880
Huh? You know him?

36:56.746 --> 36:59.182
Huh? Oh, piss and tell girl.

37:03.686 --> 37:05.389
My nigga, that's who I am.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.158
A'ight, fuck it.
I'll get straight to the chase.

37:08.891 --> 37:10.594
See, I'm startin'
a little self-help organization

37:10.793 --> 37:11.894
of the strongest brothers
in Philly.

37:12.628 --> 37:14.229
You know, just tryin'
to bring a little wealth

37:14.231 --> 37:15.599
and dignity back
to our own communities.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.233
You do it for the youth, then?

37:17.567 --> 37:19.070
I want you to get down with us,
Winston.

37:19.335 --> 37:21.338
A brother like you on the team,
man, I know we can win.

37:22.172 --> 37:23.239
Nah, man,

37:23.474 --> 37:24.773
that's not for me, man.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.541
You must find someone
else, man, not me.

37:26.543 --> 37:28.377
- That wasn't really a request.
- Got it!

37:28.744 --> 37:30.512
I'll call you
when I wanna meet with you.

37:30.514 --> 37:31.916
Just make yourself available,
man.

37:35.085 --> 37:38.054
Oh, get yourself
a new piece of pussy.

37:38.688 --> 37:40.824
We don't want niggas confusin'
us in these streets out here.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.729
Let's head up north
real quick.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.599
Baby, I put my foot in it,
didn't I?

37:52.601 --> 37:54.770
Mm-hm.
- I like Quadir.

37:55.038 --> 37:57.271
He don't say much,
but I like him.

37:57.273 --> 37:58.608
I think he says a lot.

38:00.978 --> 38:02.445
You like him, Gena, don't you?

38:03.213 --> 38:05.983
- I do.
- Why, because he has money?

38:06.715 --> 38:07.652
Honestly?

38:08.518 --> 38:09.786
Because he got on my bus.

38:11.755 --> 38:12.956
Guys will give you money,

38:13.423 --> 38:15.057
but they won't give you
their time.

38:15.059 --> 38:17.561
- That's true.
- He gave me his time.

38:18.394 --> 38:20.664
Man that gives you his time,
that's somethin'.

38:22.733 --> 38:26.070
And he asked me... he asked me
to go with him to L.A.

38:26.369 --> 38:28.572
L.A.!
Girl you goin', right?

38:29.572 --> 38:30.771
Now, he got on a bus,

38:30.773 --> 38:32.308
and now he wants
to put you on a plane?

38:32.643 --> 38:33.976
I mean, if it's okay with you.

38:34.643 --> 38:36.780
Spring break,
you're a grown woman.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.216
You have to decide
what you wanna do.

38:41.952 --> 38:44.121
Plus, if you don't go,
I'm goin'.

38:44.422 --> 38:45.990
And he does seem
like a nice guy, too.

38:46.923 --> 38:47.958
Yes.

38:48.692 --> 38:50.860
He does seem
like a very nice young man.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.663
You'd never know
he was a drug dealer.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.456
As you can see, our suites
feature vaulted ceilings,

39:22.458 --> 39:25.495
floor-to-ceiling window walls walls on
three sides, a wraparound city view.

39:25.829 --> 39:26.864
Not to mention...

39:28.164 --> 39:29.400
Thank you, sir.

39:41.710 --> 39:42.612
You like it?

39:44.380 --> 39:45.782
I mean, how can I not?

39:48.885 --> 39:50.821
It's like real
Stanley Kubrick, right?

39:51.922 --> 39:53.456
What you know
about that <i>Clockwork?</i>

39:53.690 --> 39:54.958
I know it's orange.

39:55.992 --> 39:57.128
That's what I do know.

39:58.195 --> 40:00.797
- You got two bedrooms.
- Mm, yeah.

40:01.030 --> 40:02.930
You know what I'm sayin'?
I didn't want to be out here

40:02.932 --> 40:04.266
jumping to conclusions,

40:04.501 --> 40:07.571
looking like a clown, so,
yeah, I got two rooms.

40:08.271 --> 40:09.440
I appreciate that.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.742
I appreciate you
appreciating that.

40:30.726 --> 40:32.226
Listen to some music in here,
man.

40:32.228 --> 40:34.229
Keep your hands off
the goddamn radio, man.

40:34.231 --> 40:35.366
Stay focused.

40:36.532 --> 40:37.967
How many more pick-ups we got?

40:38.168 --> 40:39.499
Um, just two.

40:39.501 --> 40:41.237
We got one downtown,
one on the west side.

40:44.106 --> 40:45.608
You tryin' to go
to that titty bar after this?

40:46.041 --> 40:47.543
- Titty bar?
- Yeah.

40:47.545 --> 40:49.209
Man, I don't be fuckin'
with no titty bar.

40:49.211 --> 40:51.014
That's for little young
boys like yourself, man.

40:51.248 --> 40:52.682
A'ight, more titties
for me then.

40:52.983 --> 40:54.417
'Bout to make it rain
in that bitch.

40:55.318 --> 40:56.784
Yeah, you make it rain,
all right.

40:56.786 --> 40:58.521
Your pockets gon' be dryer
than a motherfucker.

40:58.789 --> 40:59.924
Negative.

41:06.096 --> 41:07.164
Winston?

41:09.666 --> 41:10.834
Damn.

41:11.335 --> 41:13.670
Man, fuck that trick, man.

41:14.137 --> 41:16.137
Every nigga go to his grave,
hatin' on some bitch.

41:16.139 --> 41:17.374
But why that nigga, though?

41:17.940 --> 41:20.074
She don't even know, I'm the reason
that that nigga is on right now.

41:20.076 --> 41:21.844
Man, don't let that get
in the way of this business.

41:22.112 --> 41:23.744
Man,
Winston's just a flashy nigga.

41:23.746 --> 41:26.081
You know, dumb hoes,
they love shiny shit

41:26.083 --> 41:27.184
even when it's fake gold.

41:54.311 --> 41:56.413
You know I've never been
horseback riding before.

41:56.612 --> 41:58.581
I wouldn't be able to tell that.
You're a natural.

41:58.882 --> 41:59.916
You're a natural.

42:00.483 --> 42:02.251
Man, Sahirah would go crazy

42:02.452 --> 42:03.587
- out here.
- Yo.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.354
Sahirah does not need to be here
to go crazy. Trust me.

42:06.356 --> 42:07.889
You better stop talkin'
about my friend.

42:07.891 --> 42:09.025
- I'm just sayin'.
- You know,

42:09.224 --> 42:10.557
if it wasn't for Sahirah
we wouldn't have met.

42:10.559 --> 42:12.894
I mean, okay, granted,
but I just don't get it,

42:12.896 --> 42:14.528
you know, you guys are
nothin' alike, nothin' alike.

42:14.530 --> 42:16.197
What do you mean?
She's my best friend.

42:16.199 --> 42:18.034
We been best friends
since second grade.

42:18.268 --> 42:21.003
- All right.
- Man, it feels good to be outta Philly.

42:21.204 --> 42:24.208
I'm tellin' you, sometimes
that place, it just...

42:25.009 --> 42:27.610
just sucks the life out of you.
You know, what I'm sayin'?

42:28.210 --> 42:29.812
Why don't you
live somewhere else?

42:30.146 --> 42:31.880
Seem like you could live
anywhere you want.

42:31.882 --> 42:34.985
Because as much as I hate
the city, hate it...

42:37.353 --> 42:39.889
I still love it, it's the same.
It's crazy.

42:40.190 --> 42:41.655
- Yeah.
- It's crazy.

42:41.657 --> 42:43.891
Hey, what would you do
if you weren't doin'

42:43.893 --> 42:44.994
what you're doin' now?

42:45.295 --> 42:47.061
All I do know
is I'm not gonna be doin' this

42:47.063 --> 42:48.197
for the rest of my life.

42:48.864 --> 42:50.530
You hear me?
You can't be a father,

42:50.532 --> 42:52.566
a husband with a life like this.

42:52.568 --> 42:53.737
You just can't, you can't.

42:54.070 --> 42:56.037
You wanna be a father
and a husband?

42:56.039 --> 42:57.537
Yes, of course I do.
I want it all.

42:57.539 --> 42:59.074
I want barbecue, baseball games.

42:59.076 --> 43:03.177
I want swim meets, track meets,
Christmas, birthdays.

43:03.179 --> 43:04.713
I want that all.
I didn't grow up with that.

43:04.715 --> 43:06.283
- I didn't have that.
- Yeah, me neither.

43:06.750 --> 43:08.451
I mean, I dream about it, but...

43:09.351 --> 43:11.254
So, you dreamed
about it, so you want it, too.

43:11.788 --> 43:13.222
Yeah, I do.

43:13.789 --> 43:15.125
Well, I'ma have
to give you that.

43:35.579 --> 43:36.845
Man, I think
that fat motherfucker

43:36.847 --> 43:37.981
dodgin' our phone calls.

43:38.414 --> 43:39.914
- Yo, Aubrey.
- Hmm?

43:39.916 --> 43:41.250
Call Winston from the burner.

43:52.762 --> 43:54.595
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Winston.

43:54.597 --> 43:56.164
- <i>Now, who's this?</i>
- Jerrell wants to...

43:56.166 --> 43:57.468
<i>Eh, fuck Jerrell.</i>

43:58.735 --> 43:59.769
He hung up.

44:04.340 --> 44:06.809
I see I gotta remind
this fat motherfucker who I am.

44:29.164 --> 44:30.534
<i>I got some business
to take care of.</i>

44:30.733 --> 44:31.900
<i>I'll be back in a few hours.</i>

44:31.902 --> 44:33.133
<i>Enjoy your breakfast.</i>

44:33.135 --> 44:34.637
<i>Go buy yourself somethin' nice.</i>

45:21.751 --> 45:22.853
- Quadir.
- Carlos.

45:23.152 --> 45:24.385
How you doin', man.
It's been too long.

45:24.387 --> 45:25.989
- He's back.
- Been too long.

45:29.326 --> 45:31.427
- Javier take good care of you?
- Yeah, it was a nice ride.

45:31.628 --> 45:33.230
The 405 traffic is nuts.

45:33.496 --> 45:36.697
Ah, but the sunshine makes up
for the inconvenience.

45:36.699 --> 45:38.402
Yeah, I gotta get out here
more often.

45:39.068 --> 45:41.003
- You would benefit from that.
- I would.

45:41.371 --> 45:43.507
Look, the...
the business has changed a lot

45:43.907 --> 45:46.074
since my dad put in all
the work back in the '90s.

45:46.076 --> 45:47.244
Yeah, it was crazy times.

45:47.911 --> 45:49.012
It was.

45:49.413 --> 45:50.614
Come on. Get inside.

46:01.358 --> 46:05.062
Nowadays, the police see it
as just another vice.

46:05.262 --> 46:07.597
- Yeah.
- As long as there's no violence.

46:07.931 --> 46:09.197
Absolutely. Listen,

46:09.199 --> 46:10.532
a lot has changed for me,
Carlos.

46:10.733 --> 46:13.170
I don't get my hands dirty
anymore. I'm a businessman.

46:13.570 --> 46:15.738
Violence is bad for business
and I assure you

46:16.072 --> 46:18.206
anyone I employ
will only resort to violence

46:18.208 --> 46:20.276
unless it is
absolutely necessary.

46:20.909 --> 46:23.579
If you can guarantee that,
we can proceed as planned

46:23.913 --> 46:26.380
and immediately a pipeline
will be opened up to you.

46:27.617 --> 46:29.016
- You have my word.
- Let's do it.

46:29.018 --> 46:30.751
Let's do it.

46:30.753 --> 46:33.323
So, what is the shipping method?

46:35.891 --> 46:36.960
We're sitting in it.

46:43.199 --> 46:44.932
I love it, I love it.

47:09.293 --> 47:10.794
Is there something
I can help you with?

47:11.193 --> 47:12.628
Yes, how much is this?

47:13.329 --> 47:14.662
Eleven.

47:14.664 --> 47:16.233
Seriously? Eleven dollars?

47:16.532 --> 47:19.068
No, 1100.

47:22.137 --> 47:23.973
I'll take it.

47:28.512 --> 47:29.880
You know, I'll take this, too.

47:32.114 --> 47:33.449
Yeah, Sahirah will like that.

47:35.251 --> 47:36.820
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

47:56.639 --> 47:58.338
The easiest way
to get over one chick

47:58.340 --> 47:59.476
is to get another one.

47:59.742 --> 48:01.508
I don't see
that happenin' right now.

48:01.510 --> 48:03.179
- Why not?
- Because she right over there.

48:03.380 --> 48:05.347
- Oh, there she is.
- Hey y'all.

48:05.681 --> 48:07.215
What's goin' on?

48:07.483 --> 48:08.552
How's it goin'?

48:09.918 --> 48:11.219
Girl, you shinin'.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.487
- What's up, Tyrik?
- How are you?

48:12.489 --> 48:13.456
What's up?

48:14.257 --> 48:16.358
Eh, eh, eh, man,
cut that out, man.

48:16.860 --> 48:18.260
Huggin' on my lady like that.

48:19.096 --> 48:20.927
Look, I had a lot
of fun with you, Rasun,

48:20.929 --> 48:24.063
but I'm not really
the relationship type girl.

48:24.065 --> 48:26.902
- Winston playin' you out.
- Aww, come on, Rasun.

48:27.503 --> 48:29.605
Most of the brothers out here
got a woman at home.

48:30.106 --> 48:31.838
I don't care
who Winston hooks up with

48:31.840 --> 48:33.242
as long as he takin' care of me.

48:33.677 --> 48:36.911
Look, I am not interested
in bein' nobody's girlfriend.

48:36.913 --> 48:40.680
I say who, I say when,
I control this.

48:40.682 --> 48:42.749
Naw, money control everything
around you.

48:46.590 --> 48:49.092
Look, I like you, Rasun.
We had fun, but...

48:50.059 --> 48:51.193
I ain't the one for you.

48:55.697 --> 48:56.799
Take care, okay?

49:01.771 --> 49:03.940
Where your shorty goin', my nig?

49:04.407 --> 49:05.909
You lookin' real lonely.

50:43.706 --> 50:45.174
The bags in the car.

50:55.217 --> 50:56.983
- You had a good time?
- Had a great time.

50:56.985 --> 50:58.219
You already in high heels.

51:00.822 --> 51:03.225
Big things poppin' out here.

51:03.525 --> 51:06.026
I'm glad that you had
a good time.

51:06.028 --> 51:08.729
- I did.
- You lookin' fly, you feel fly.

51:08.731 --> 51:10.530
- Thank you.
- Huh, you feel fly?

51:10.532 --> 51:12.398
- Uh-huh, I do.
- Okay good.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.069
- I'm glad you had a good time.
- Thank you.

51:14.670 --> 51:16.138
It was the best time
I've ever had.

51:16.438 --> 51:19.442
Well, many more to come, I hope.

51:20.208 --> 51:21.708
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

51:21.710 --> 51:23.111
- We'll see.
- We'll see, indeed.

51:23.579 --> 51:25.378
- All right, you be good.
- You, too.

51:25.380 --> 51:26.482
All right.

51:33.255 --> 51:34.324
Hey, y'all!

51:35.423 --> 51:36.626
You miss me?

51:42.431 --> 51:43.567
Bria, what's wrong?

51:46.668 --> 51:47.770
Gah-Git, what's the matter?

51:51.041 --> 51:53.910
Baby, I didn't wanna call
or text you this,

51:54.376 --> 51:58.914
but Sahirah got caught up
in a shootout last night.

51:59.416 --> 52:00.617
Sahirah what?

52:01.884 --> 52:03.052
Is she... is she okay?

52:07.791 --> 52:09.025
I'll just call her.

52:09.625 --> 52:10.594
Gena.

52:11.494 --> 52:13.296
She didn't make it, baby.

52:14.797 --> 52:17.132
Enough.
That's not funny, Gah-Git.

52:17.766 --> 52:21.971
I'm sorry, I know how hard
this must be for you.

52:22.804 --> 52:24.838
I know it's hard for you,
precious.

52:24.840 --> 52:26.507
Come on, come on.

52:26.509 --> 52:29.510
<i>I'm not available
to take your call right now.</i>

52:51.766 --> 52:53.936
What happened?

52:57.340 --> 53:00.776
- What the fuck happened?
- They hit Winston first.

53:01.242 --> 53:03.612
Sahirah was there
when it happened, so she gone.

53:04.146 --> 53:06.615
- That's what happened.
- Sorry, Ra.

53:08.617 --> 53:09.950
So, we popped their corner boys.

53:09.952 --> 53:11.487
- You did what?
- We did.

53:12.454 --> 53:14.423
What the fuck
did you do that for?

53:14.623 --> 53:15.923
Fuck you mean?

53:15.925 --> 53:17.224
You expect us to sit
on our hands all day

53:17.226 --> 53:18.724
while these niggas
just take a shit on us?

53:18.726 --> 53:20.394
I expect you to be
a motherfuckin' professional,

53:20.396 --> 53:21.664
that's what I expect you to do.

53:21.864 --> 53:23.165
- It was professional.
- That was not professional.

53:23.365 --> 53:25.768
- It was emotional and weak.
- Emotional?

53:26.534 --> 53:28.202
I apologize that
that happened to Sahirah,

53:28.204 --> 53:30.173
but you know what it is.
She was a casualty.

53:31.740 --> 53:35.911
We cannot afford
to go to war right now.

53:36.644 --> 53:37.913
Not during this transition.

53:40.416 --> 53:42.648
- Man, so what we gon' do?
- Let Jerrell know

53:42.650 --> 53:45.019
that you can't make money
tradin' bullets.

53:45.021 --> 53:46.188
Go see
the little rich white bitch.

53:46.454 --> 53:47.422
Ashley, Aubrey.

53:47.623 --> 53:48.924
We'll send a message
through her.

53:49.559 --> 53:51.260
And if we fall back,
they fall back, it's over.

53:51.527 --> 53:52.929
I'll be back.

53:53.530 --> 53:55.365
- Drop the prices.
- Drop 'em?

53:56.231 --> 53:57.233
Drop 'em.

53:57.833 --> 53:59.400
We hit 'em in the pockets,
hit 'em where it hurts,

53:59.402 --> 54:00.503
make 'em reasonable.

54:07.309 --> 54:08.612
Dropped.

54:16.085 --> 54:17.119
I'm sorry.

54:53.456 --> 54:54.988
<i>Hi, this is Sahirah.</i>

54:54.990 --> 54:57.291
<i>I'm not available
to take your call right now,</i>

54:57.293 --> 54:59.929
<i>but leave a message at the beep
and I'll get back to you.</i>

55:00.128 --> 55:01.229
<i>Holla.</i>

55:08.471 --> 55:09.639
Oh, baby.

55:11.039 --> 55:13.206
Gah-Git, I just wanna
be by myself.

55:13.208 --> 55:14.510
Oh, come here.

55:18.246 --> 55:19.382
All right.

55:22.818 --> 55:24.485
Quadir stopped by again.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.019
Did you tell him I wasn't here?

55:26.021 --> 55:28.856
Yeah, but you know
he don't believe that.

55:28.858 --> 55:31.227
I don't care what he believes.
He never liked Sahirah.

55:31.427 --> 55:34.396
I'm not sayin' what you're doin'
isn't right, it is.

55:34.963 --> 55:37.032
And you know I don't
want that life for you...

55:38.000 --> 55:39.369
but I also think

55:39.668 --> 55:41.538
there's a right way
to do things.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.142
I don't wanna see him.

55:46.876 --> 55:48.775
I just wanna be left alone.

55:48.777 --> 55:51.380
And you have every right
to feel that way,

55:52.148 --> 55:54.483
but you need to look
that man in his eyes

55:54.851 --> 55:56.184
and tell him it's over.

55:57.085 --> 55:59.188
Now, I done said
what I have to say...

56:00.856 --> 56:02.958
but I'm not gonna be lyin'
for you

56:03.358 --> 56:04.827
if that boy
comes over here again.

56:18.039 --> 56:19.208
Peace be Allah.

57:37.987 --> 57:40.456
<i>Hi, this is Gena.
Sorry I'm not available.</i>

57:40.655 --> 57:42.621
<i>Leave a message
and have a blessed day.</i>

57:42.623 --> 57:44.526
<i>Thanks.</i>

58:32.807 --> 58:33.809
Gena.

58:40.815 --> 58:41.850
Gena...

58:43.018 --> 58:44.019
are you awake?

59:03.137 --> 59:04.540
I know you're not asleep, Gena.

59:09.445 --> 59:10.479
Damn, Bria.

59:11.045 --> 59:12.347
Fuck you do that for?

59:14.016 --> 59:15.217
Quadir stopped by again.

59:15.784 --> 59:17.153
Do I have to listen to this?

59:17.619 --> 59:19.385
He said he's sorry
about what happened to Sahirah.

59:19.387 --> 59:20.255
Stop.

59:21.123 --> 59:22.258
He never liked Sahirah.

59:22.824 --> 59:24.657
He ran her down
any chance he got.

59:24.659 --> 59:26.159
Look,
I'm not the smartest person

59:26.161 --> 59:27.494
in the world. Shit,

59:27.496 --> 59:29.097
I'm not the smartest person
anywhere, but,

59:29.731 --> 59:31.867
I do know what happened
to her, happened to her.

59:32.099 --> 59:34.034
It don't got nothing' to do
with you or Quadir.

59:34.036 --> 59:35.901
You don't have to tell me
what he said.

59:35.903 --> 59:37.938
I got all his texts
about how much he loves me.

59:37.940 --> 59:40.742
How he wants me to come live
with him, yadda yadda, whatever.

59:41.009 --> 59:42.110
Yeah, well, do you love him?

59:44.847 --> 59:46.449
He sure does act
like he loves you.

59:48.583 --> 59:50.185
Yes, I love him...

59:51.186 --> 59:52.621
but that ain't got
nothing to do with it.

59:52.855 --> 59:55.054
I ain't trying to be
no save-a-ho type of bitch.

59:55.056 --> 59:57.358
Maybe you're not the one
that needs saving, maybe he is.

01:02:17.398 --> 01:02:18.666
Pap!

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:19.833
She didn't even know
she was president

01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:22.568
of the ignorant side piece club.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:23.605
That was awesome.

01:02:24.172 --> 01:02:25.273
- Thank you.
- This is the most

01:02:25.474 --> 01:02:27.539
incredible drink I ever had.

01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:29.175
- Mm.
- But you don't drink, Gah-Git.

01:02:29.177 --> 01:02:31.012
Oh, she gets tipsy
after communion.

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:33.048
Shoog made me this drink.

01:02:33.681 --> 01:02:35.083
I couldn't turn her down.

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:36.751
Shoog,
what's the name of this drink?

01:02:37.018 --> 01:02:38.184
It's called Linwood.

01:02:38.186 --> 01:02:39.889
It's got grapefruit juice,
vodka,

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.258
- and a splash of Midori Sour.
- Whoo!

01:02:44.059 --> 01:02:45.960
Make me feel like I'm sittin'
on the beach.

01:02:46.728 --> 01:02:49.297
And she also told me
that Quadir...

01:02:49.965 --> 01:02:52.066
- why y'all together.
- Really?

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:53.402
Shoog, what you tell Gah-Git?

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.802
Well, she said
that both of y'all

01:02:55.804 --> 01:02:56.971
raised by your grandmothers...

01:02:58.039 --> 01:03:00.442
and that he don't even speak
to his mom.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.611
- She a devil.
- Preach.

01:03:02.978 --> 01:03:04.411
All right, you cut off, Gah-Git.

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.412
- Bria, you drivin'.
- I already know.

01:03:06.414 --> 01:03:09.750
Ah, well good, then you got
a designated driver. Drink up.

01:03:10.217 --> 01:03:11.418
- Cheers.
- You grown.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.621
I'm grown, let me play.

01:03:13.521 --> 01:03:14.887
- I don't even know her.
- You want one?

01:03:14.889 --> 01:03:16.523
But I know
if he don't like her.

01:03:16.525 --> 01:03:17.626
- Thank you.
- You want one?

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:19.860
Man, that food was good,
but this house, though, man.

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:22.461
This is... I need one
just like this, man.

01:03:22.463 --> 01:03:23.563
This shit is nice, ain't it?

01:03:23.565 --> 01:03:24.831
You can get one,
you can get one.

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:27.066
Speaking of that,
I think it's a good time

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:29.403
for some talk about my exit.

01:03:29.804 --> 01:03:30.806
- Hmm?
- Exit?

01:03:31.206 --> 01:03:32.375
You goin' somewhere, man?

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:34.277
I mean, now that things
are goin' well with Carlos...

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:36.846
it's a good time
to step outta the game.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.282
We getting money
in every direction, Qua.

01:03:40.815 --> 01:03:43.985
Philly, New York,
D.C. Chi Town, ATL.

01:03:44.753 --> 01:03:46.086
Man, we getting 40 cent

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:47.220
out of every dollar
earned to the east...

01:03:47.222 --> 01:03:48.257
- Black...
- ...of the Mississippi.

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:49.490
- How you gon' give that up?
- ...Black.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.059
Y'all both was talkin' about,

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:51.727
y'all wanting to step up,

01:03:52.327 --> 01:03:53.996
more responsibility.
Well, here we are.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.028
Tyrik's in L.A.
dealin' with Carlos.

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:57.132
When he comes back...

01:03:58.166 --> 01:04:00.001
- the game is y'all's.
- So, are you happy now?

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:01.304
One hundred percent.

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:04.040
- All right, then.
- All right.

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.876
What's up with all
this clandestine shit?

01:04:43.878 --> 01:04:45.413
Jerrell wanted us
to holla at you.

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:47.849
I know Winston's your man
and all, but he's gone.

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:49.916
You can get in the car
and roll with us

01:04:49.918 --> 01:04:52.251
and be a king,
or get ran over by us.

01:04:52.253 --> 01:04:54.956
Look, man,
I just wanna make my money,

01:04:55.356 --> 01:04:57.423
smoke my smoke,
and fuck bitches.

01:04:57.425 --> 01:04:58.626
Everybody wanna be a king.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.795
King's don't live
long in Philly.

01:05:15.643 --> 01:05:17.712
Text Jerrell and let him know
we got Blair on lock.

01:05:19.681 --> 01:05:21.616
If not, I'll make him famous.

01:05:26.355 --> 01:05:28.224
<i>Yo, I'm like...
I'm like, worn out.</i>

01:05:28.423 --> 01:05:30.059
Yeah, me, too.

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:31.760
But today was a good day.

01:05:32.193 --> 01:05:33.360
Yeah, it was.

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:34.729
It looked like everybody
had a good time.

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:38.767
Shoog and Gah-Git was like
old drinkin' buddies, literally.

01:05:39.467 --> 01:05:40.768
You know like regular people.

01:05:41.202 --> 01:05:43.369
What does that... What does
that mean, regular people?

01:05:43.371 --> 01:05:44.905
We're regular people, baby.

01:05:45.206 --> 01:05:46.307
We are regular, look at this.

01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:48.477
This is... Those apples,
those are just regular apples.

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.479
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean? Huh?

01:05:51.079 --> 01:05:53.481
Wait! Wait, wait, wait,
before I forget.

01:05:53.882 --> 01:05:55.150
Uh, here we go.

01:05:55.617 --> 01:05:57.550
Gena, you know
I don't like surprises...

01:05:57.552 --> 01:05:58.918
- Okay, close your eyes.
- ...like that.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.755
Nope, ab...
absolutely not.

01:06:01.056 --> 01:06:02.924
- Okay, don't close your eyes.
- Okay.

01:06:05.827 --> 01:06:06.829
What's this?

01:06:08.463 --> 01:06:10.166
You always askin'
to read my work.

01:06:12.099 --> 01:06:14.467
Oh, I made it to the,
"I can read your work phase."

01:06:14.469 --> 01:06:16.436
Look at me breakin' you on down.

01:06:16.438 --> 01:06:17.740
- Check it out.
- Yeah, just read it.

01:06:20.275 --> 01:06:22.610
I'm lying still
and I sense you there,

01:06:23.077 --> 01:06:26.248
in fingers all over,
touching me everywhere.

01:06:26.815 --> 01:06:29.485
I feel your strength,
I feel you inside.

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:32.754
You're taking me someplace,
insanities hide.

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:36.088
And now you're on top,
you're big and strong.

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:39.293
You're makin' me open
and you're taking control.

01:06:40.295 --> 01:06:42.162
The deeper you're able,
the deeper you'll go

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:45.835
because you have
the power and I can't say no.

01:06:47.302 --> 01:06:48.738
Okay, okay, wait. This...

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:51.838
- This is about us, huh?
- Yeah.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.307
I wrote it when we were in L.A.

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:57.913
Well, nobody's ever,
like, this is a first.

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:00.483
Some of my best work
is about you.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:02.981
I'm like, I'm your muse.

01:07:02.983 --> 01:07:04.186
That's what they call it, right?

01:07:04.418 --> 01:07:06.153
I'm gonna submit it
for my writing competition.

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:10.224
I think... I think, uh,
this is good material,

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:12.492
but I think you maybe need
a little bit more.

01:07:12.494 --> 01:07:13.762
- Oh, do we?
- Yeah. Just a little...

01:07:13.961 --> 01:07:15.262
- Oh, yeah, just a little bit?
- Just a little bit.

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:16.298
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

01:07:17.364 --> 01:07:18.867
- You're great.
- Hmm.

01:07:24.972 --> 01:07:27.009
Yo, Qua, man, I wanna say
I appreciate you

01:07:27.442 --> 01:07:29.476
givin' me a shot to step up
and do some things, all right.

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.311
- That's enough of that.
- For real.

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.547
I have faith in you.

01:07:32.746 --> 01:07:34.716
You remind me of myself out here
when I was a young boy.

01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:38.153
Listen, you slow down
and watch the road.

01:07:39.153 --> 01:07:41.322
- I'm goin' the speed limit.
- Not that road.

01:07:41.989 --> 01:07:43.192
The game, Black.

01:07:45.092 --> 01:07:46.861
Be anxious for nothin' out here.

01:07:48.496 --> 01:07:51.067
Know the players, let the game
come to you, hmm?

01:07:52.266 --> 01:07:53.333
Yeah.

01:07:59.173 --> 01:08:00.876
- Yeah?
- What you doin'?

01:08:01.175 --> 01:08:02.277
<i>I'm busy, Cherelle.</i>

01:08:03.244 --> 01:08:04.145
You tryin' to come over?

01:08:04.545 --> 01:08:06.947
I'm not being mean.
I told you, we're done.

01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:09.081
What type of fake ass Muslim
are you?

01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:10.751
Ain't you allowed
to have multiple wives?

01:08:11.286 --> 01:08:12.721
<i>Besides, I know
how to play my role</i>

01:08:13.221 --> 01:08:14.556
and I just want
some dick anyway.

01:08:16.224 --> 01:08:17.693
The problem is I care.

01:08:20.028 --> 01:08:21.130
Well, fuck you.

01:08:23.363 --> 01:08:25.331
You know what,
I always thought of Cleopatra

01:08:25.332 --> 01:08:27.135
and Mark Antony
as such a forbidden love.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:30.435
All the crazy paparazzi,
everybody goin' crazy

01:08:30.438 --> 01:08:32.939
about them hookin' up,
but you know, it worked.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.577
That's an interesting point.

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:37.076
Now, people, we have to remember
that Cleopatra

01:08:37.078 --> 01:08:38.712
was the last pharaoh
of ancient Egypt

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:41.046
and her
and Mark Antony's relationship

01:08:41.048 --> 01:08:43.383
was considered to be
one of the greatest

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:44.719
love affairs of history.

01:08:46.587 --> 01:08:49.356
Okay, people, chapters nine
and ten next time.

01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:51.991
And for those of you submitting
for the writer's internship,

01:08:51.993 --> 01:08:53.795
please make sure
all your contact information

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.162
is on your submission.

01:08:57.131 --> 01:08:58.533
Thanks so much.

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:04.538
Thank you.

01:09:20.287 --> 01:09:22.023
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>

01:09:23.925 --> 01:09:26.925
Whoa, snowflake,
I didn't see you back there.

01:09:26.926 --> 01:09:28.095
Your mother and father
know where you at?

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.031
I guess you saw us
following you, huh?

01:09:31.599 --> 01:09:33.533
I heard you like to meet
in empty barber shops.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.336
You still gettin'
the wrong idea about...

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:36.969
No, I think I pretty much got

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:38.974
the exact right idea about you.

01:09:39.573 --> 01:09:41.441
You do know I'm just trying
to help you out, right?

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:43.612
Ah, that's what the Nazis told
the Jews, right?

01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:46.778
Yeah, I mean, you wanna know
how a motherfucker

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:48.682
do what he does,
you study how he does it.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:49.883
Mm.

01:09:49.885 --> 01:09:51.353
It's no secret
you loading the city up.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.054
Now, I ain't even mad at you.

01:09:53.287 --> 01:09:54.389
I mean, get that paper.

01:09:55.056 --> 01:09:56.925
But to stay strong
you need a strong army

01:09:57.391 --> 01:09:58.594
or you get overthrown.

01:09:58.993 --> 01:10:01.162
That's what you did to Winston
and Sahirah, you overthrew them?

01:10:02.163 --> 01:10:03.331
Nah.

01:10:03.798 --> 01:10:06.702
I mean, your man disrespected
and underestimated my ability.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.134
And Sariah or whatever
the fuck her name is,

01:10:09.136 --> 01:10:11.372
I mean, she was cool,
I ain't want that,

01:10:11.573 --> 01:10:13.040
but you needed
to see my strength.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.708
- I seen it.
- Look, man, I'm not here

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:15.844
for a pissin' match.

01:10:16.711 --> 01:10:19.114
Your squad
with my soldiers together?

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:21.582
We could run this city
like a Fortune 500 company.

01:10:21.949 --> 01:10:23.684
Fortune 500, huh?

01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:26.384
- With y'all three.
- Wall Street, my nigga.

01:10:26.386 --> 01:10:27.488
Wall Street.

01:10:28.489 --> 01:10:29.523
Hmm.

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:32.827
- You up for that task?
- My hand to God I am,

01:10:33.161 --> 01:10:35.197
or whoever you pray to.
No disrespect.

01:10:41.536 --> 01:10:42.404
You're in.

01:10:46.708 --> 01:10:48.242
What about your man,
Rasun and Tyrik?

01:10:48.476 --> 01:10:51.078
Oh, oh, oh,
Rasun and Tyrik, let's see.

01:10:52.046 --> 01:10:54.214
No need for us to be crabs
in a barrel.

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.083
See, that's the problem
with black people.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.552
No, no, that's the problem
with niggas.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.087
This what we gon' do.

01:10:59.753 --> 01:11:03.123
Meet me at, uh, Cafe Breezers
on the parkway Friday night.

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:04.827
I'm gonna talk
to the guys and smooth it out.

01:11:05.426 --> 01:11:07.960
But this little dance
gonna cost you, brother.

01:11:07.962 --> 01:11:09.463
- How much we talkin'?
- A meal ticket.

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.500
- We'll be there.
- My dude.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:16.137
Read page 69,
wonderful write up.

01:11:17.805 --> 01:11:19.305
Bitch ass nigga.

01:11:19.307 --> 01:11:20.743
Told y'all he was soft.

01:11:21.442 --> 01:11:22.644
Just like that.

01:11:23.511 --> 01:11:25.111
If you wanna be king,
you gotta be willing

01:11:25.113 --> 01:11:27.216
to step to the throne
and take that jawn.

01:11:39.394 --> 01:11:40.462
So...

01:11:41.729 --> 01:11:42.898
what'd ya think?

01:11:44.699 --> 01:11:46.300
I think that you should, um...

01:11:47.234 --> 01:11:49.604
kill that intern competition
and just publish.

01:11:49.971 --> 01:11:51.403
What do you mean?
I already submitted

01:11:51.405 --> 01:11:52.772
for the writing internship.

01:11:52.774 --> 01:11:54.610
You know how expensive
it is to publish a novel?

01:11:55.243 --> 01:11:58.311
Gena, I don't see
anybody turning you down.

01:11:58.313 --> 01:11:59.980
If they don't see that,
fuck 'em.

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:01.817
We'll self-publish.

01:12:02.783 --> 01:12:04.051
- Hmm.
- You'd do that?

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:06.355
Of course I would.
It's 'cause you're cute...

01:12:07.255 --> 01:12:08.556
and kind of a good writer.

01:12:11.092 --> 01:12:12.692
I ain't playin',
you're a wonderful writer.

01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:17.965
Jerrell and Aubrey on the way.

01:12:20.702 --> 01:12:21.837
What's up, mama?

01:12:23.971 --> 01:12:25.206
Yo, we lookin' for the lounge.

01:12:25.472 --> 01:12:26.839
Uh, yeah, man,
it's right through there,

01:12:26.841 --> 01:12:28.609
- but it's closed right now.
- We good.

01:12:29.176 --> 01:12:30.442
Let's make sure
these pussy ass niggas

01:12:30.444 --> 01:12:31.479
is here, man.

01:13:06.247 --> 01:13:07.882
Surprise!

01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:11.686
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

01:13:20.595 --> 01:13:21.695
We got 'em.

01:13:22.096 --> 01:13:23.064
Jerrell ain't here.

01:13:30.037 --> 01:13:31.672
Bria, excuse me for a moment.

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:34.509
Uh.

01:13:34.842 --> 01:13:37.043
I think it's time
that we do a real toast.

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:40.715
On your special day we all know
how special this queen is.

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:42.684
I'm just gonna say I love you.

01:13:43.417 --> 01:13:44.452
I love you, too.

01:13:44.752 --> 01:13:45.887
So, let's raise our glass.

01:13:50.057 --> 01:13:51.126
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

01:13:51.725 --> 01:13:53.360
Everybody is real serious
right now.

01:13:54.762 --> 01:13:56.465
Hey yo,
it was a serious toast.

01:14:00.033 --> 01:14:01.268
It's incredible.

01:14:01.868 --> 01:14:03.505
Most incredible day of my life.

01:14:04.738 --> 01:14:05.773
Thank you.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:10.543
This incredible day
is just getting started.

01:14:13.414 --> 01:14:14.347
Oh my God.

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.318
Oh my God.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.588
- Oh my God.
- Really?

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.158
Really? Are you serious?

01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:25.828
Look at you.

01:14:26.661 --> 01:14:27.729
Oh my gosh.

01:14:28.796 --> 01:14:30.595
- GENA Thank you, baby!
- You're welcome, baby.

01:14:30.597 --> 01:14:31.966
You in love.

01:14:34.802 --> 01:14:36.671
- Shit.
- What?

01:14:37.405 --> 01:14:39.341
- Cherelle's here.
- Where she at?

01:14:39.574 --> 01:14:42.677
She's in another parking lot
but she walkin' over here.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:44.779
- I'll take care of it.
- All right.

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:53.520
- Whoa.
- Get...

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.323
- Get off of me!
- Calm down.

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:58.527
- This ain't right, Tyrik.
- You know what...

01:14:59.993 --> 01:15:01.260
it was real good
while it lasted,

01:15:01.262 --> 01:15:02.495
but he has moved on

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:05.867
and I suggest
you do the same thing.

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:09.268
Nigga, get your hands off of me.
If Quadir thinks

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:11.004
he's about to pass me
down to you

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.374
like some hand me
down clothes,

01:15:13.173 --> 01:15:14.208
I don't date down.

01:15:14.809 --> 01:15:16.175
Down, bitch?

01:15:16.177 --> 01:15:17.612
You ain't nothin'
but a side fuckin' piece.

01:15:18.179 --> 01:15:19.812
Now, be a lady
and walk your ass away

01:15:19.814 --> 01:15:23.050
before I gut you and throw you
in the fucking garbage.

01:15:23.784 --> 01:15:25.552
Fuck you and that nigger Quadir.

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.655
Oh, yeah, you know
how to do that well.

01:15:33.094 --> 01:15:34.162
Bitch.

01:15:34.929 --> 01:15:36.030
Excuse me.

01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:41.299
- That new leather.
- What are these numbers for?

01:15:41.301 --> 01:15:44.171
Seven, twenty-eight, eighty-six,
those are security codes

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.807
in case you ever have
a problem you won't forget 'em.

01:15:47.475 --> 01:15:48.911
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:15:50.177 --> 01:15:51.579
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:53.582
Hold up.

01:16:00.621 --> 01:16:02.190
They shot Black.

01:16:03.858 --> 01:16:04.860
Just now.

01:16:10.230 --> 01:16:11.465
Thank you, thank you.

01:16:12.399 --> 01:16:14.032
- What's... what's wrong?
- Oh, nothin', baby.

01:16:14.034 --> 01:16:16.268
There's a... there's a fire
at the restaurant, so...

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:17.371
- Fire?
- Yeah.

01:16:17.771 --> 01:16:18.937
- Is everybody okay?
- Everybody's fine.

01:16:18.939 --> 01:16:20.140
Everybody's a'ight.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.975
I'ma take Tyrik and we gon'
check it out, all right?

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.376
- Enjoy your friends.
- You go with Gena.

01:16:24.378 --> 01:16:25.447
Make sure she's good.

01:16:25.713 --> 01:16:27.148
All right? Love you.

01:16:27.381 --> 01:16:29.016
Love you, too.
All right, you ready?

01:16:29.250 --> 01:16:30.351
Come on, let's go!

01:16:36.323 --> 01:16:38.092
It was exactly how you said
it would be.

01:16:38.592 --> 01:16:41.195
We did our thing,
he was grabbin' the money...

01:16:42.096 --> 01:16:43.764
and that's when I saw
Jerrell wasn't there.

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:45.367
How'd they get Black?

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:49.070
Put a shitload of bullets
into him, Qua.

01:16:51.538 --> 01:16:53.140
I didn't know
Rich was still alive.

01:16:54.108 --> 01:16:55.210
They shot Black,

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.578
so I popped
his motherfuckin' ass.

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:00.983
I tried to get Black
to the hospital...

01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:05.287
- died in the car.
- Where'd you leave him at?

01:17:07.087 --> 01:17:08.623
Bus stop on the parkway?

01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:12.494
Well,
that's a hell of a funeral.

01:17:16.597 --> 01:17:18.365
Make sure his mother
gets whatever she needs.

01:17:18.599 --> 01:17:20.433
Qua, I think we should
put everything on pause

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:21.770
- just for a minute.
- No...

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:25.806
if we freeze now we risk
losin' our connect, Carlos.

01:17:26.474 --> 01:17:27.609
So, no fuckin' way.

01:17:34.515 --> 01:17:35.683
Tyrik's right.

01:17:36.751 --> 01:17:38.020
We gotta end Jerrell.

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:40.856
Get everybody on it.

01:17:57.771 --> 01:17:59.541
This car is so nice.

01:17:59.807 --> 01:18:01.742
It drives so smooth.

01:18:02.542 --> 01:18:04.478
Now I have to get Tyrik
to buy me one.

01:18:05.012 --> 01:18:06.713
Yeah, it's too bad Tyrik
and Quadir

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:08.449
had to handle
that fire situation.

01:18:08.815 --> 01:18:10.051
Mm-hm.

01:18:11.351 --> 01:18:12.886
You don't think
there was a fire?

01:18:13.587 --> 01:18:16.123
I'm married to a gangster
and you're dating one.

01:18:16.657 --> 01:18:17.659
You tell me.

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:28.970
What the fuck? Oh my God!

01:18:30.171 --> 01:18:32.170
- Get outta the fuckin' car.
- Gena!

01:18:32.172 --> 01:18:33.839
Gena!

01:18:33.841 --> 01:18:35.676
Don't you fucking move, bitch.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.862
Tell Quadir to put together
two million dollars

01:18:55.328 --> 01:18:56.497
and wait for my call.

01:19:01.668 --> 01:19:03.335
What you're gonna do
is you're gon' let Ray drive you

01:19:03.337 --> 01:19:05.370
to your mama house,
stay there with the boys

01:19:05.372 --> 01:19:06.574
until you hear from me.

01:19:07.475 --> 01:19:08.877
- All right?
- Okay.

01:19:12.279 --> 01:19:13.380
Be careful.

01:19:50.251 --> 01:19:51.584
All right, I got some people
findin' out

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:52.951
where that bitch
Aubrey's parents live.

01:19:52.953 --> 01:19:53.921
Fuck her.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.757
What about Jerrell?

01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:58.859
She been bankrollin' Jerrell.
We find her, we find him.

01:20:15.909 --> 01:20:16.943
- Yeah.
- <i>Huntington Park,</i>

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.210
- <i>one hour.</i>
- One hour,

01:20:18.212 --> 01:20:19.181
Huntington Park.

01:20:27.154 --> 01:20:29.957
Can I just say
what we all thinkin'?

01:20:30.490 --> 01:20:31.626
She's not dead.

01:20:32.225 --> 01:20:34.293
Well, then, it's a setup
to get at you, Qua.

01:20:34.295 --> 01:20:35.593
What would you do
if it was Lita?

01:20:35.595 --> 01:20:36.864
I don't give a fuck
if it was the pope.

01:20:38.666 --> 01:20:40.598
Lita know the game. I told her
when we first hooked up

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.967
if she go high signin'
that motherfucker

01:20:41.969 --> 01:20:44.337
snatch her ass up,
she on her own.

01:20:44.805 --> 01:20:46.608
You know, Tyrik, you right.

01:20:47.074 --> 01:20:49.510
Everybody wanna preach about
how they true to the game...

01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:52.213
until the game go against them.

01:20:52.479 --> 01:20:54.881
Listen,

01:20:55.449 --> 01:20:57.853
I'll roll with you. But this?

01:21:01.087 --> 01:21:02.122
I cannot do it.

01:21:26.314 --> 01:21:27.615
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>I bet you know</i>

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:29.348
<i>who the fuck Jerrell Jackson

01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:30.648

01:21:30.650 --> 01:21:32.354
<i>and listen and pull in this lot.</i>

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.462
<i>Now stop the car, Quinton.</i>

01:21:43.264 --> 01:21:44.199
<i>Get out slow.</i>

01:21:52.939 --> 01:21:54.775
<i>Have fat boy

01:22:05.786 --> 01:22:06.988
<i>Yeah, that's far enough.</i>

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:10.792
<i>Now walk back slowly.</i>

01:22:12.426 --> 01:22:14.128
<i>Aww, what's wrong, Quincy?</i>

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:15.829
<i>Why you lookin' so sad, bruh?</i>

01:22:23.537 --> 01:22:25.039
<i>Old washed up ass nigga.</i>

01:22:25.439 --> 01:22:26.705
<i>The fuck you try to play me</i>

01:22:26.707 --> 01:22:27.975
<i>and I stay two steps

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:34.082
<i>Yeah, you lookin'

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:39.087
<i>Yeah, nigga.</i>

<i>Bad ass Quadir Richards.</i>

01:22:44.725 --> 01:22:46.560
<i>The nigga

01:22:48.895 --> 01:22:50.564

01:22:51.966 --> 01:22:53.001

<i>I think you need

01:22:56.637 --> 01:22:58.105
<i>You gettin' old

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.478
<i>Now go get your bitch, nigga.</i>

01:23:09.484 --> 01:23:11.353
You okay?

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.488
Okay.

01:23:14.788 --> 01:23:16.358
You okay?

01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:18.827
Oh my God.

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.964
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:23:26.367 --> 01:23:28.135
Hey, it's over, it's over.

01:23:28.769 --> 01:23:29.871
It's over, it's over.

01:25:20.247 --> 01:25:23.549
I must say
that this is truly first class.

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:24.985
It's really nice,
it's beautiful.

01:25:25.485 --> 01:25:27.121
The suede, the stitching.

01:25:27.787 --> 01:25:29.022
You got good taste, Aubrey.

01:25:29.289 --> 01:25:30.158
I'm impressed.

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:34.362
What is your fascination
with niggas?

01:25:36.396 --> 01:25:37.532
See, it blows my mind.

01:25:38.399 --> 01:25:39.432
Here I am

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:42.268
doin' everything I can do
to get out of this life

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:44.939
and this privileged white girl,
all you wanna do is get in.

01:25:45.171 --> 01:25:46.338
If you're gonna kill me, just...

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:48.510
Nobody's gonna kill you, Aubrey.

01:25:50.109 --> 01:25:51.145
Where's Jerrell?

01:25:54.114 --> 01:25:55.215
- I don't know.
- Don't.

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:56.951
Don't do that.

01:25:58.185 --> 01:25:59.552
Thought we were
building a rapport,

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:01.655
thought we were...
we were gettin' somewhere.

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:04.492
This is a beautiful property,
beautiful.

01:26:05.458 --> 01:26:06.592
This your parents' place?

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.126
Don't bring my parents
into this.

01:26:08.128 --> 01:26:09.730
You brought your parents
into this, huh?

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:14.536
- Where's Jerrell?
- He's in L.A.

01:26:16.036 --> 01:26:18.137
I'm supposed to meet him
at the Standard Hotel

01:26:18.139 --> 01:26:19.574
on Sunset in three days.

01:26:23.645 --> 01:26:25.980
Good thing you stopped by
to say goodbye to your parents.

01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:33.053
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

01:26:33.319 --> 01:26:34.421
<i>Carlos.</i>

01:26:34.988 --> 01:26:37.421
<i>I know it's early in L.A.
I apologize, but it's importan.</i>

01:26:37.423 --> 01:26:39.090
It's not a problem,
just getting in.

01:26:39.092 --> 01:26:39.993
How can I help you?

01:26:40.527 --> 01:26:42.126
You remember that friend of mine
I was telling you about?

01:26:42.128 --> 01:26:45.030
He's gonna be in L.A.
the Sunset Standard Hotel

01:26:45.032 --> 01:26:47.702
in three days.
You just make sure he's good.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:51.072
<i>Si.</i> We'll make sure
he sleeps well, my friend.

01:26:51.338 --> 01:26:52.407
My man.

01:26:52.672 --> 01:26:53.840
Always a pleasure.

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.002
I woke up...

01:27:22.869 --> 01:27:24.037
and you were gone.

01:27:26.073 --> 01:27:27.842
- I had to go handle business.
- Where'd you go?

01:27:30.743 --> 01:27:32.443
I had to handle my business.

01:27:32.445 --> 01:27:33.314
What did you do?

01:27:35.181 --> 01:27:37.417
I had to handle my business.

01:27:38.752 --> 01:27:39.954
You killed him.

01:27:41.588 --> 01:27:42.623
I'm out.

01:27:44.591 --> 01:27:45.726
It's over.

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:52.097
I'm tryin' to get us
the fuck outta here.

01:27:52.099 --> 01:27:53.299
Okay, all right.

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:54.469
What do you mean
"All right"?

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:56.938
What do you... I don't understand
what your problem is?

01:27:57.971 --> 01:27:59.072
- What are you doin'?
- Nothin'.

01:27:59.372 --> 01:28:00.571
What are you doin'?
Don't walk away from me...

01:28:00.573 --> 01:28:01.773
Listen, if we gon' be
in the hood

01:28:01.775 --> 01:28:03.075
we might as well live
in the hood,

01:28:03.077 --> 01:28:04.910
not some fake fantasy land.
I'm goin' home.

01:28:04.912 --> 01:28:06.447
You sound ridiculous,
you are home.

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:08.780
I can't believe
I actually convinced myself

01:28:08.782 --> 01:28:09.982
that you would get out
of this game.

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:12.686
I'm out of the game, Gena.

01:28:13.252 --> 01:28:14.553
If you outta the game,

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:15.823
then tell me
where you were this morning.

01:28:16.923 --> 01:28:19.724
- Where were you?
- I was busy makin' plans.

01:28:19.726 --> 01:28:21.194
- What plans?
- Marry me.

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.699
- Don't fuck with me, Quadir.
- I'm not fuckin' with you.

01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:29.537
I'm not about this life anymore.

01:28:31.471 --> 01:28:32.673
So, when I say it's over...

01:28:34.574 --> 01:28:35.609
it's over.

01:28:37.243 --> 01:28:38.378
For real?

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:39.980
I swear to you

01:28:40.447 --> 01:28:41.815
on my grandmother's grave...

01:28:42.983 --> 01:28:44.085
I'm out.

01:28:45.085 --> 01:28:46.621
But I'm not goin' by myself.

01:28:48.588 --> 01:28:49.590
Marry me.

01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:52.527
All you gotta do is say yes.

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:54.826
- Yes.
- All right?

01:28:54.828 --> 01:28:55.827
- Yes.
- That's it.

01:28:55.829 --> 01:28:57.064
Yes.

01:29:48.849 --> 01:29:49.951
Yo!

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:51.719
You wanna be famous, bitch?

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:54.422
Get down, get down!

01:30:02.828 --> 01:30:04.864
No! Please!

01:30:05.532 --> 01:30:07.902
Please help!

01:30:09.369 --> 01:30:10.903
Talk to me, come on,
talk to me.

01:30:11.238 --> 01:30:13.106
Help, please!

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:20.314
Help!

01:30:22.515 --> 01:30:23.550
Help!

01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:26.284
Hold on, baby, hold on.

01:30:27.753 --> 01:30:28.789
I love you.

01:30:31.358 --> 01:30:32.793
No, no!

01:32:23.636 --> 01:32:24.835
Viola?

01:32:24.837 --> 01:32:25.939
Hope you don't mind
if I come in.

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.039
Of course not,
come in, come in.

01:32:28.041 --> 01:32:29.110
How are you?

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:30.844
I'm doin' well.

01:32:31.211 --> 01:32:32.710
- Movin' forward.
- Yeah?

01:32:32.712 --> 01:32:33.747
And you?

01:32:34.381 --> 01:32:35.516
You know.

01:32:35.815 --> 01:32:37.148
- You look good.
- Thank you,

01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:38.417
- so do you.
- It's good to see you.

01:32:39.051 --> 01:32:40.086
Thanks for havin' me.

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.989
You know, my attorney sent you
several notices in the mail.

01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:45.657
You didn't get them?

01:32:45.659 --> 01:32:47.724
I haven't checked
the mail lately, sorry.

01:32:47.726 --> 01:32:49.063
Oh, no worries.

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:55.235
But nonetheless,
I have power of attorney

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:56.737
over Quadir's estate.

01:32:58.972 --> 01:33:00.673
- What does that mean?
- That means

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:02.909
that this house is goin' up
for sale.

01:33:03.644 --> 01:33:05.512
Now, I can give you
a week to move,

01:33:05.912 --> 01:33:07.213
but that's all I can do for you.

01:33:10.016 --> 01:33:11.750
Your son hasn't even been dead
two weeks

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:13.585
and you're
already selling his belongings?

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:15.422
Quadir's at peace now, Gena.

01:33:16.021 --> 01:33:17.656
The rest of us must move on.

01:33:17.658 --> 01:33:19.359
Quadir bought this place
for me and him,

01:33:19.693 --> 01:33:21.992
- so we share it. It's mine.
- If you look

01:33:21.994 --> 01:33:25.198
at the deed,
you'll see my name is on it.

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:27.934
The same for his cars,
his businesses.

01:33:28.201 --> 01:33:29.500
Just because you slept here

01:33:29.502 --> 01:33:31.202
doesn't make it your house,
honey.

01:33:31.204 --> 01:33:32.870
You haven't stepped foot
in this house

01:33:32.872 --> 01:33:34.073
before 30 seconds ago.

01:33:34.341 --> 01:33:36.811
Not even one visit to see
how me and Quadir were.

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:38.375
Now you wanna come in here

01:33:38.377 --> 01:33:39.613
and try and take it away
from me?

01:33:40.447 --> 01:33:41.782
That's not gonna happen.

01:33:42.416 --> 01:33:43.484
We'll see about that.

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:46.884
You know what,
you can have all this shit.

01:33:46.886 --> 01:33:48.754
I'll be out in a week,
'cause I got something

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:51.292
you'll never have,
Quadir's love.

01:33:52.826 --> 01:33:53.994
Bitch.

01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:20.154
Oh, you going to bed
without eating again?

01:34:20.987 --> 01:34:22.021
I'm not hungry.

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:23.824
I just wanna go to sleep.

01:34:24.824 --> 01:34:27.060
Well, what ya need to do
is go to church

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:28.826
with me and Bria tomorrow.

01:34:28.828 --> 01:34:31.731
I'm good.
Tell God I said what's up.

01:35:21.347 --> 01:35:22.850
- Rasun?
- Gena, you okay?

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:25.717
I've been callin' you.

01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:27.085
I'm sorry, Rasun.

01:35:27.087 --> 01:35:29.890
You know, it's just...
you know, with Qua...

01:35:31.958 --> 01:35:33.661
I just needed some time to...

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:35.628
just deal.

01:35:36.162 --> 01:35:38.364
I know. I feel you.

01:35:39.298 --> 01:35:43.036
I didn't really say anything
when Sahirah got killed but...

01:35:43.837 --> 01:35:45.506
it made me feel
some kinda way.

01:35:45.905 --> 01:35:46.940
Me, too.

01:35:47.673 --> 01:35:48.809
And now Qua's gone.

01:35:50.610 --> 01:35:52.113
I haven't felt like
goin' anywhere.

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:55.316
I feel like I'm in a bad dream.

01:35:55.914 --> 01:35:56.917
I feel you.

01:35:57.449 --> 01:35:59.750
Do you know Quadir's parents
didn't even tell me

01:35:59.752 --> 01:36:01.453
- where the funeral was?
- What?

01:36:01.921 --> 01:36:04.421
I didn't even get a chance
to say a proper goodbye to him.

01:36:04.423 --> 01:36:05.458
Damn.

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:09.163
You talked to Tyrik?

01:36:09.762 --> 01:36:10.730
Nah.

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.567
Everything's just about business
for him.

01:36:14.367 --> 01:36:17.070
Lita died and he's still
on the streets makin' moves.

01:36:17.302 --> 01:36:19.340
Yeah, I'm not like him.
I just can't do it anymore.

01:36:21.573 --> 01:36:24.108
- You goin' back to school?
- I have enough credits

01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:25.912
where I don't have
to go this semester

01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:28.780
- and I can still graduate.
- But how you doin' financially?

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:31.415
His mama took everything.
We only had

01:36:31.417 --> 01:36:33.284
a few thousand dollars
in our bank account.

01:36:33.286 --> 01:36:35.419
But you can't hide
that kind of money in the bank.

01:36:35.421 --> 01:36:36.923
Well, he never said anything
to me about it.

01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:41.695
This'll hold you
for a little bit.

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:43.096
You don't have to do that.

01:36:43.496 --> 01:36:44.597
Look, I'm good.

01:36:44.797 --> 01:36:46.198
If you ever need somethin',

01:36:46.399 --> 01:36:47.668
all you gotta do
is holla, a'ight?

01:36:48.935 --> 01:36:49.937
Thank you.

01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:51.905
So, I gotta go.

01:37:05.418 --> 01:37:07.253
Thank you for checkin' on me.

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:08.922
You're welcome, Gena.

01:37:10.789 --> 01:37:12.827
You think that maybe you wanna
come stay with me?

01:37:13.894 --> 01:37:15.462
You should probably go, Rasun.

01:37:16.496 --> 01:37:17.664
Okay.

01:37:39.085 --> 01:37:41.188
I see you ain't moved
since we left here.

01:37:42.855 --> 01:37:43.990
How was church?

01:37:45.257 --> 01:37:47.192
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:49.196
- You tell him I said what's up?
- Yes,

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:52.266
and he told me to tell you
to get yo' shit together.

01:37:58.805 --> 01:37:59.873
Gena, you are trippin'.

01:38:01.841 --> 01:38:04.577
- What is this?
- It came from your old house.

01:38:06.712 --> 01:38:09.347
- When did this come?
- I don't know, who's it from?

01:38:09.349 --> 01:38:10.851
My college professor.

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:27.901
That's it, times up, people.
Pens down.

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.403
Make sure all your information
is on your sheet,

01:38:30.837 --> 01:38:31.805
and I'll see you tomorrow.

01:38:38.011 --> 01:38:39.146
Professor Busby.

01:38:40.881 --> 01:38:42.914
Gena, we've been tryin'
to reach you.

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:45.583
I know, I'm sorry.
I've had family issues,

01:38:45.585 --> 01:38:47.087
but I just got the letter.

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.654
It's not too late is it?

01:38:48.854 --> 01:38:49.789
Well, you placed second.

01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:51.391
I could probably place
a phone call.

01:38:51.791 --> 01:38:54.060
Could you, please?
I would really appreciate it.

01:38:54.493 --> 01:38:55.628
Should I?

01:38:59.666 --> 01:39:00.701
Listen, Gena...

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:03.637
in light
of your recent disappearances,

01:39:03.837 --> 01:39:06.103
your absences,
I wouldn't be comfortable

01:39:06.105 --> 01:39:07.974
making that call
unless I was absolutely sure

01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:11.175
- that you were serious.
- I am, I'm serious.

01:39:11.177 --> 01:39:13.445
You do understand
this is an unpaid internship

01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:15.280
and you'd have
to support yourself

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:16.615
in New York for a year?

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:18.918
I understand. I can do it.

01:39:23.088 --> 01:39:24.158
Okay.

01:43:40.345 --> 01:43:43.349
Oh, baby!

01:43:44.216 --> 01:43:45.551
Oh, precious.

01:43:47.653 --> 01:43:48.721
Mm, mm, mm.

01:43:49.154 --> 01:43:51.724
- Why don't you come with me?
- And give up all this?

01:43:53.626 --> 01:43:56.293
My heart and soul is in Philly.

01:43:56.295 --> 01:43:59.496
But you been takin' care of
everybody else your whole life.

01:43:59.498 --> 01:44:02.568
Why don't you come let me
take care of you for a while.

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:04.738
You worried
about bein' on your own?

01:44:06.338 --> 01:44:08.641
I don't know,
I ain't never done it.

01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:10.744
Gena, I raised a...

01:44:11.577 --> 01:44:12.546

01:44:14.113 --> 01:44:15.414
You gon' be just fine.

01:44:19.552 --> 01:44:20.621
You're right.

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.822

01:44:24.222 --> 01:44:26.326

01:44:26.759 --> 01:44:28.960

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:30.831

01:44:31.863 --> 01:44:33.099

01:44:34.533 --> 01:44:35.636

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:37.604

01:44:44.476 --> 01:44:46.613
Precious.

01:44:47.913 --> 01:44:49.248
Okay, go on now.

01:44:59.826 --> 01:45:01.328
Philly girls.

01:45:10.403 --> 01:45:13.405
<i>The streets can make you
and the streets can break you.</i>

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:16.776
<i>To those caught in the trap
of temporary pleasures,</i>

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:18.310
<i>let me tell you this.</i>

01:45:18.911 --> 01:45:21.780
<i>Whatever you do,
make it worth something.</i>

01:45:22.414 --> 01:45:24.147
<i>All of your consequences in life</i>

01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:25.784
<i>are dependent
upon your behavior,</i>

01:45:26.418 --> 01:45:28.854
<i>so stay true to the game.</i>
