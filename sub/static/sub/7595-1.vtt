00:01.053 --> 00:02.418
Bye, Alvin.

00:04.089 --> 00:05.954
I'll be a-coming back.

00:12.064 --> 00:13.088
Ma.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.593
What are they a-fighting for?

00:17.236 --> 00:19.363
I don't rightly know, child.

00:21.507 --> 00:23.600
I don't rightly know.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

00:33.882 --> 00:36.544
Come on, you guys.
Hit the dirt and hit it hard.

00:36.618 --> 00:38.017
Okay, Sarge.

00:40.622 --> 00:44.524
Now look, Ross. That's not a teaspoon
you got there, it's a shovel.

00:44.592 --> 00:46.753
- Lay into it.
- Okay, General.

00:46.895 --> 00:48.362
Dig, soldiers, dig.

00:48.596 --> 00:50.188
Dig your way straight down to China.

00:50.265 --> 00:51.994
- Okay, Sarge.
- China?

00:52.367 --> 00:56.497
What's the idea of going to China?
I thought this war was in Europe.

01:00.508 --> 01:02.476
Parsons, Sergeant Early.

01:03.678 --> 01:04.940
Yes, sir.

01:05.212 --> 01:07.147
Which one of your men is York?

01:07.215 --> 01:09.740
He is the big, lanky fellow,
fourth from the end, sir.

01:09.818 --> 01:12.412
- Having any trouble with him?
- No, sir. Why?

01:12.754 --> 01:15.484
He's down here
as a conscientious objector.

01:15.557 --> 01:17.752
Keep your eye on him.
I want a weekly report.

01:17.826 --> 01:19.088
Yes, sir.

01:24.799 --> 01:26.664
That'll be a big help.

01:27.335 --> 01:28.825
Dig. Dig. Dig.

01:30.171 --> 01:34.608
I've been working in a subway all my life,
never thought about the guys that dug it.

01:34.676 --> 01:37.907
But since I'm in the army,
I sure take my hat off to them.

01:37.979 --> 01:39.879
- Subway you say?
- Yeah.

01:40.014 --> 01:41.879
What's this here subway
you're talking about?

01:41.950 --> 01:44.612
You mean to say you don't know
what a subway is? That guy kidding?

01:44.686 --> 01:46.779
No, they don't have subways
where he comes from, I guess.

01:46.855 --> 01:49.415
They haven't? Ain't they civilized?
Where you from?

01:49.491 --> 01:52.517
Pall Mall.
Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf.

01:52.694 --> 01:54.685
- Where is that?
- Tennessee.

01:54.929 --> 01:56.658
Ain't you ever even seen a subway?

01:56.731 --> 01:59.996
- Ain't never even heard of one.
- You never... What? Heard?

02:00.068 --> 02:01.968
Heard? What kind of talk is that?

02:02.036 --> 02:04.334
Do they all talk that kind of English
where you come from?

02:04.406 --> 02:08.467
Well, there ain't any English people
down our way, just Americans.

02:08.643 --> 02:11.840
Well, look, a subway is a big hole
in the ground, see?

02:11.946 --> 02:13.607
It goes for miles.

02:13.681 --> 02:16.013
- Straight down?
- Yeah... No.

02:16.518 --> 02:18.452
It doesn't go straight down,
it goes this way.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.112
- Oh, this a-way?
- Yeah.

02:20.221 --> 02:22.382
- Under the ground?
- Under the ground.

02:22.457 --> 02:25.221
- And trains run through it.
- They run through it?

02:25.293 --> 02:27.193
- Yeah.
- Steam cars?

02:27.262 --> 02:29.594
Steam... No. Steam cars.

02:29.664 --> 02:32.599
- They're electric, Alvin.
- I sure would like to see one of 'em.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.999
You see, they have to run trains
under the ground in New York,

02:35.069 --> 02:37.333
- because it's so crowded.
- Crowded? I'll say.

02:37.405 --> 02:39.896
Look, it's the rush hour,
the Bronx Express is just pulling in.

02:39.974 --> 02:41.965
I'm standing on the platform,
holding back the mob.

02:42.043 --> 02:44.876
The doors open up and I...
You know what I'm talking about?

02:44.946 --> 02:46.709
Just a word now and then.

02:46.781 --> 02:49.909
Well, you see, the people are just coming
from work and they wanna get home, see,

02:49.984 --> 02:51.542
and they wanna get into the cars
all together.

02:51.619 --> 02:53.348
They start pushing,
I'm trying to hold 'em back.

02:53.421 --> 02:57.187
Well, anyway, the doors open up and
now, buddy, this is where the fun begins.

02:57.258 --> 02:58.782
"Move back in the cars," I yell.

02:58.860 --> 03:01.761
Ain't no room in there, but I yell,
"Move back in the cars."

03:01.830 --> 03:05.231
Boy, how I used to push 'em in. I used
to pack them in like sardines in a can.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.528
That's why they call me "Pusher."

03:06.601 --> 03:08.466
All right, Pusher, that's mess call.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.504
- Get a move on.
- Yes, sir.

03:11.005 --> 03:14.304
This is the one bugle call
I ain't got no arguments with.

03:14.509 --> 03:17.444
- 2-4-1-8-0-0.
- Zaranopolis Nick.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.581
2-4-1-8-0-1.

03:21.649 --> 03:24.413
- 2-4-1-8-0-1.
- Ross, Michael T.

03:24.486 --> 03:26.579
Hey, this one's full of grease.
Ain't you got a clean one?

03:26.654 --> 03:29.418
- Clean it, buddy. And keep it clean.
- Sure.

03:29.491 --> 03:34.224
- 2-1-8-1-0-2.
- 2-1-8-1-0-2.

03:36.030 --> 03:37.520
York, Alvin C.

03:37.932 --> 03:39.832
Anything wrong with it?

03:40.568 --> 03:42.695
Well, it sure is a fine rifle gun.

03:42.804 --> 03:46.934
I thought maybe you might have
some conscientious objections to it.

03:47.141 --> 03:48.768
No, sir, I ain't.

03:48.877 --> 03:52.438
Careful you don't kill anybody with it
till we get to France.

03:52.514 --> 03:54.539
- Next man.
- There you are, York.

03:54.616 --> 03:59.144
- 2-1-4-8-0-3.
- 2-1-4-8-0-3.

03:59.220 --> 04:00.744
Thomas, Bert E.

04:08.963 --> 04:11.022
Boy, look at that shine,
is that clean or is that clean?

04:11.099 --> 04:13.192
Look, Sarge, you can eat
right off the trigger.

04:13.268 --> 04:14.428
Not bad.

04:17.572 --> 04:18.766
You call that clean?

04:18.839 --> 04:21.274
- What's the matter with it?
- Look.

04:22.010 --> 04:24.706
- I don't see nothing.
- It's full of grease.

04:24.779 --> 04:26.440
Won't that make the bullet
come out faster?

04:26.514 --> 04:27.742
Clean it.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.718
That's a good job, York.

04:30.919 --> 04:32.887
Did you ever clean a rifle before?

04:32.954 --> 04:36.617
Ain't never cleaned one like that before.
I done clean my own, though.

04:36.691 --> 04:38.352
So you've got a gun of your own,
have you?

04:38.426 --> 04:41.361
- Yes, sir.
- I wouldn't think you'd have one.

04:52.106 --> 04:54.836
Well, the next time get your sling
a little higher on your arm.

04:54.909 --> 04:56.035
Okay.

04:56.210 --> 04:58.906
Pull in your necks, soldiers.
Those rookies are gonna start shooting.

04:58.980 --> 05:02.643
Now, remember, you guys,
you're using real, live ammunition.

05:02.717 --> 05:06.710
A bullet hasn't got any brains.
It'll hit whatever you aim it at.

05:06.888 --> 05:08.879
So don't start murdering each other.

05:08.957 --> 05:11.687
All right, let's go. Ready on number 30.

05:11.759 --> 05:13.386
Ready, number 30.

05:14.596 --> 05:16.723
Not yet, we'll try it first.

05:18.166 --> 05:21.067
Relax, Ross, loosen up. Yeah, that's better.

05:21.169 --> 05:22.602
Take a deep breath.

05:23.137 --> 05:25.002
Blow, let a little of it out.

05:25.707 --> 05:26.935
Hold it.

05:27.008 --> 05:29.408
Remember, keep your sights
on the center of the bull's-eye.

05:29.477 --> 05:31.445
Take up the slack in the trigger gradually.

05:31.512 --> 05:34.948
Don't pull it. Squeeze it slowly.
Just like you were squeezing a lemon.

05:35.016 --> 05:37.484
Ready? Aim.

05:39.954 --> 05:41.512
I can't hold it no more.

05:41.589 --> 05:43.989
All right, Ross, take another one.

05:44.459 --> 05:45.551
Aim.

05:46.928 --> 05:47.986
Fire.

05:48.062 --> 05:51.031
Look, Ross, you had your thumb
sticking straight up in the air.

05:51.099 --> 05:52.259
Just like that.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.732
Oh, yeah. That gives me balance.

05:53.801 --> 05:56.099
Oh, it does? It gives you balance, does it?

05:56.170 --> 05:57.535
- Yeah.
- Here.

05:58.573 --> 05:59.631
Load.

06:01.643 --> 06:02.667
Aim.

06:04.112 --> 06:06.979
- Fire.
- Oh, my eye.

06:07.482 --> 06:09.507
Maybe that will teach you
to keep your thumb down.

06:09.584 --> 06:12.951
That's something
for the rest of you men to remember.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.684
- A miss.
- Miss.

06:21.195 --> 06:22.890
Ready on number 29.

06:23.464 --> 06:24.863
Ready on 29.

06:24.932 --> 06:26.263
Ready, 29.

06:28.469 --> 06:31.370
All right, York. Let's see what you can do.

06:31.472 --> 06:33.463
Aim. Fire.

06:35.543 --> 06:38.137
I ain't much good at this here practicing,
Sergeant.

06:38.212 --> 06:40.737
All right, next time get that sling
a little higher on your arm.

06:40.815 --> 06:42.305
Press your cheek
a little closer to the stock.

06:42.383 --> 06:43.407
Yes, sir.

06:43.484 --> 06:46.385
Make sure that front sight
divides the rear sight in half.

06:46.454 --> 06:48.615
I reckon I know about that, Sergeant.

06:48.690 --> 06:50.783
You reckon you know about that, do you?

06:50.858 --> 06:52.485
We'll see. Here.

06:54.829 --> 06:56.729
Load. Aim.

07:01.436 --> 07:02.460
Fire.

07:06.174 --> 07:07.903
- A miss!
- Miss.

07:09.744 --> 07:12.235
So you know about sighting, do you?

07:12.447 --> 07:14.881
I sure thought I cut plumb center
that time.

07:14.949 --> 07:16.382
You did, huh?

07:16.451 --> 07:20.114
I can't no ways see how I can miss
that whole great big target.

07:20.188 --> 07:22.782
Sharpshooter York requests a re-mark.

07:23.491 --> 07:25.015
Re-mark for 29.

07:25.093 --> 07:26.822
Re-mark, 29.

07:27.261 --> 07:29.320
Oh, I didn't see that one.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.992
- A bull's-eye, 4:00.
- Bull's-eye.

07:36.370 --> 07:39.737
I can't figure out how I got
way down there on the edge.

07:39.807 --> 07:43.174
Well, I reckon I can do a little better
when I get used to this here rifle gun.

07:43.244 --> 07:45.644
Here's five chances to do better.

07:50.952 --> 07:52.510
Fire when ready.

07:54.789 --> 07:57.849
Hey, what are you wetting
that front sight for?

07:58.392 --> 08:00.656
Why, it kind of cuts down the haze.

08:00.728 --> 08:04.391
I always wet my sights
when I'm fixing to do some shooting.

08:04.966 --> 08:06.991
Okay, do some shooting.

08:15.810 --> 08:18.938
- Bull's-eye, dead center.
- Bull's-eye.

08:19.046 --> 08:21.310
Okay, York. You're on your own.

08:27.655 --> 08:30.146
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

08:35.563 --> 08:37.793
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

08:42.669 --> 08:45.195
- Bull's-eye.
- Bull's-eye.

08:49.777 --> 08:51.836
Hey, look at this.
Right through the marker.

08:51.913 --> 08:53.904
That ain't no rookie, that's Buffalo Bill.

08:53.981 --> 08:56.006
Let's see that target, Sergeant.

08:56.984 --> 08:59.111
Bring 29 to the firing line.

09:04.592 --> 09:07.720
There's the first shot,
and here's the other five here.

09:07.795 --> 09:10.696
I reckon that there gun
shoots a might to the right.

09:10.765 --> 09:13.256
Where did you learn to shoot, York?

09:13.367 --> 09:16.063
Well, I ain't never learnt, Sergeant.

09:16.137 --> 09:19.868
Folks back home used to say
I could shoot a rifle before I was weaned.

09:19.941 --> 09:22.273
But they was exaggerating some.

09:24.445 --> 09:28.438
Now, supposing these here cartridges
is a flock of wild turkeys,

09:28.515 --> 09:31.507
a-flying across the ridge
coming this a-way, see, right at me.

09:31.585 --> 09:33.212
Now, which one of them
would you shoot first?

09:33.287 --> 09:35.585
I'd take a crack at all of 'em
and trust to luck.

09:35.656 --> 09:37.624
Well, you wouldn't have no luck
that way, Pusher.

09:37.691 --> 09:40.524
No? Well, then I'd pick the motorman.

09:41.128 --> 09:44.154
- The what?
- The motorman. The guy out in front.

09:44.665 --> 09:47.429
Well, that ain't right either,
if you wanna get more than one turkey.

09:47.501 --> 09:49.230
Now, which one of them's
got the most meat on him?

09:49.303 --> 09:50.895
Yeah, what's the answer?

09:50.971 --> 09:53.201
Well, now, if you shoot this one here,
the leader,

09:53.274 --> 09:55.572
the rest of 'em will see him drop
and fly off, see?

09:55.643 --> 09:58.840
So, you draw down
on the last turkey here,

09:59.513 --> 10:01.606
and then the next one, see?

10:01.882 --> 10:04.316
Kind of coming from back to front.

10:04.752 --> 10:07.243
Then the rest of 'em won't know
they're being hit.

10:07.321 --> 10:08.413
And, if...

10:08.489 --> 10:11.390
Of course, they might flare off some
when the shooting starts,

10:11.458 --> 10:13.756
but if a fellow's got himself
a repeating rifle,

10:13.827 --> 10:15.818
he's got a good chance
of getting the whole flock.

10:15.896 --> 10:18.558
- Sounds all right.
- Turkeys sure is dumb animals.

10:18.632 --> 10:21.567
Seems you picked up a good bit
down in the hills, Alvin.

10:21.635 --> 10:24.103
Oh, anybody that's done any hunting
knows that.

10:24.171 --> 10:27.368
Alvin C. York!
Report to Major Buxton immediately.

10:27.441 --> 10:30.103
- Yes, sir.
- What have you been up to now?

10:30.177 --> 10:33.442
I don't know.
I've been aiming not to make no trouble.

10:33.514 --> 10:34.572
It's your move.

10:37.685 --> 10:40.882
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Yes, York. At ease.

10:41.689 --> 10:46.058
York, Captain Danforth has just
handed me a report concerning you,

10:46.126 --> 10:48.026
made by your company sergeant.

10:48.095 --> 10:49.357
Yes, sir?

10:49.496 --> 10:52.090
You have a very excellent camp record.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.368
Well, I'm mighty glad to hear that, sir.

10:55.436 --> 10:59.099
You applied for exemption, I believe,
as a conscientious objector.

10:59.173 --> 11:00.435
Yes, sir.

11:00.641 --> 11:03.166
Well, I think we can disregard that.

11:03.977 --> 11:07.242
York, Sergeant Parsons
recommends your promotion

11:07.314 --> 11:09.373
to the rank of corporal with special detail

11:09.450 --> 11:12.078
as instructor in target practice.

11:12.653 --> 11:15.121
Captain Danforth and I heartily approve.

11:15.189 --> 11:17.157
I congratulate you, York.

11:18.325 --> 11:22.318
Well, I'm much obliged to you,
Major Buxton and Captain Danforth.

11:23.197 --> 11:26.291
Well, I'll learn 'em fellows to shoot
the best I can,

11:26.367 --> 11:28.699
like I already done Pusher and Bert.

11:28.769 --> 11:33.365
I mean, Privates Ross and Thomas, sir,
but,

11:34.641 --> 11:37.508
well, I don't want to be no corporal.

11:37.578 --> 11:40.672
- What's that?
- I said I don't want to be no corporal.

11:40.848 --> 11:43.908
- Why not?
- Wait a minute, Captain. Let him talk.

11:44.084 --> 11:45.745
Well, you see, I...

11:45.819 --> 11:48.549
Is it because of your
religious convictions, York?

11:48.622 --> 11:50.351
Yes, sir. That's it.

11:50.858 --> 11:53.190
You see, I believe in the Bible,

11:53.460 --> 11:58.124
and I'm a-believing
that this here life we're living

11:58.198 --> 12:00.632
is something the Lord done give us.

12:00.701 --> 12:03.499
And we got to be a-living it
the best we can.

12:03.570 --> 12:07.563
And I'm figuring that a-killing other folks

12:07.641 --> 12:11.975
ain't no part of what he was intending
for us to be a-doing here.

12:13.714 --> 12:16.012
Well, yes. In a way I agree with you.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.051
York, with your permission, Major?

12:18.118 --> 12:20.609
Certainly, Captain. Sit down, York.

12:21.221 --> 12:23.951
You... You say you believe in the Bible?

12:24.358 --> 12:25.620
Yes, sir.

12:25.759 --> 12:27.351
Well, I do, too.

12:27.761 --> 12:30.992
But do you believe that the Bible means
that a man shouldn't fight

12:31.064 --> 12:33.430
for what he believes to be right?

12:33.734 --> 12:35.463
Well, it done said,

12:36.103 --> 12:37.968
"Blessed are the peacemakers."

12:38.038 --> 12:39.733
Yes, I know, but...

12:40.774 --> 12:43.766
You remember that verse,
I think it's in Luke,

12:44.178 --> 12:48.877
where he says, "He that hath no sword,
let him sell his garment, and buy one"?

12:48.949 --> 12:50.780
He said that to Peter.

12:51.285 --> 12:53.276
But he doesn't stop Peter
from using his sword.

12:53.353 --> 12:57.483
He said, "Them that lives by the sword
will be a-perishing by the sword."

12:57.558 --> 12:59.185
That were further on.

12:59.326 --> 13:02.523
- Yes, I remember, but...
- No, go ahead, Captain, go ahead.

13:02.796 --> 13:04.787
But according to St. John,

13:05.065 --> 13:08.364
he said, "My kingdom is not of this world.

13:08.769 --> 13:12.068
"If my kingdom were of this world,
then would my servant fight."

13:12.139 --> 13:13.970
Well, that's just the point, Captain.

13:14.041 --> 13:17.135
He done said
his kingdom were not of this world.

13:17.444 --> 13:19.537
And that... That is different.

13:19.613 --> 13:22.138
- Yes, but...
- Just a moment, Captain.

13:22.349 --> 13:25.011
York, have you ever read this?

13:25.352 --> 13:27.650
<i>"History of the United States."</i>

13:30.824 --> 13:32.951
It sure is a lot of writing.

13:37.931 --> 13:39.694
- Daniel Boone?
- Yeah.

13:40.434 --> 13:41.765
You know about him?

13:41.835 --> 13:44.235
Well, everybody down our way
knows about Daniel Boone.

13:44.304 --> 13:46.465
First man into
the Valley of the Three Forks.

13:46.540 --> 13:49.737
Yes, he was quite a man,
one of the greatest.

13:50.878 --> 13:53.346
And that book's full of great men.

13:54.448 --> 13:59.147
York, what do you suppose that
Boone was looking for

13:59.219 --> 14:01.517
when he went out alone
into the wilderness?

14:01.588 --> 14:03.988
Well, I never thought much on it.

14:04.391 --> 14:06.586
Was he looking for new lands?

14:06.727 --> 14:08.490
- Might be.
- Maybe.

14:09.429 --> 14:11.397
Maybe for something more.

14:11.698 --> 14:16.431
Something that a man just can't see
with his eyes or hold in his hands.

14:17.704 --> 14:21.140
Something that some men don't even
know they have until they've lost it.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.540
- Yes, sir.
- To be free.

14:25.178 --> 14:27.578
Now, that's quite a word, freedom.

14:28.382 --> 14:30.509
I think that's what he wanted.

14:30.584 --> 14:34.315
I think that's what sent Boone
into your Tennessee country.

14:34.621 --> 14:37.089
Is that what...
That what this here book's about?

14:37.157 --> 14:38.283
Yep.

14:38.926 --> 14:42.487
That's the story of a whole people's
struggle for freedom

14:42.563 --> 14:45.031
from the very beginning until now.

14:45.098 --> 14:47.191
For we're still struggling.

14:47.868 --> 14:49.893
It's quite a story, York.

14:50.437 --> 14:53.634
How they all got together
and set up a government,

14:54.841 --> 14:58.504
whereby all men were pledged
to defend the rights of each man,

14:58.579 --> 15:01.548
and each man
to defend the rights of all men.

15:02.215 --> 15:05.616
We call it a government of the people,

15:06.453 --> 15:09.286
by the people and for the people.

15:11.491 --> 15:14.392
Why, I never knowed
it was all written down.

15:14.728 --> 15:17.492
- You're a religious man, York.
- Yes, sir.

15:18.799 --> 15:20.960
You want to worship God
in your own way.

15:21.034 --> 15:22.194
Yes, sir.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.362
- You're a farmer?
- Yes, sir.

15:24.471 --> 15:26.701
You want to plow your fields
as you see fit,

15:26.773 --> 15:29.936
and raise your family
according to your own likes?

15:30.010 --> 15:33.878
And that's your heritage and mine,
every American's.

15:34.314 --> 15:36.111
But the cost of that heritage is high.

15:36.183 --> 15:40.085
Sometimes it takes all we have
to preserve it, even our lives.

15:41.088 --> 15:43.420
How you gonna answer that, York?

15:44.825 --> 15:46.019
Well...

15:46.793 --> 15:50.285
You done given me a powerful lot
to be a-thinking about.

15:52.332 --> 15:54.129
Well, take your time.

15:54.635 --> 15:59.766
Well, if I could only get home,
back in 'em there hills, I...

15:59.840 --> 16:02.365
- What would you do?
- Well, I could...

16:03.677 --> 16:05.907
I could figure something out.

16:07.014 --> 16:09.414
I've done a heap of thinking
up yonder there once.

16:09.483 --> 16:11.917
All right, take 10 days' furlough.

16:12.419 --> 16:13.716
You mean I can go home?

16:14.054 --> 16:15.954
And when you get back,
if you still can't see it our way,

16:16.023 --> 16:17.115
I'll recommend your exemption.

16:17.190 --> 16:19.488
- You will?
- Report to me as soon as you get back.

16:19.559 --> 16:21.686
I'll arrange your furlough, York,
starting tomorrow.

16:21.762 --> 16:23.627
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

16:24.197 --> 16:26.461
I sure would like to read this here book.

16:26.533 --> 16:29.263
Go ahead. Take it with you if you want to.
You can borrow it.

16:29.336 --> 16:32.703
Thank you, Major Buxton.
Thank you, Captain Danforth.

16:48.555 --> 16:50.022
Come on, boy.

17:45.312 --> 17:48.770
Want me to be a-setting four places, Ma,
or just three?

17:49.483 --> 17:51.110
Can't say, child.

17:52.352 --> 17:55.014
Ma, ain't Alvin ever gonna eat again?

17:56.189 --> 18:00.489
The Book says
man don't live by bread alone.

18:01.194 --> 18:04.254
Well, what about that there hound dog
he's got with him?

18:04.331 --> 18:06.162
He can't read the Book.

18:07.234 --> 18:08.861
Get the table set.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.975
He's up at the point. Been up there all day.

18:17.711 --> 18:19.906
Want George to go get him, Ma?

18:22.816 --> 18:24.215
Let him be.

18:41.635 --> 18:43.500
<i>Put your trust in the Book, Alvin.</i>

18:43.570 --> 18:46.164
<i>But here's another book, York.
The History of the United States.</i>

18:46.239 --> 18:48.833
<i>Them that lived by the sword,
will be a-perishing by the sword.</i>

18:48.909 --> 18:51.377
<i>The government of all men
to defend the rights of each man.</i>

18:51.444 --> 18:53.469
<i>And each man
to defend the rights of all men.</i>

18:53.547 --> 18:56.277
<i>Remember, the Lord done said,
"Thou shalt not kill."</i>

18:56.349 --> 18:58.374
<i>But the cost of that heritage is high.</i>

18:58.451 --> 19:00.749
<i>Sometimes all we have to preserve it,
even our lives.</i>

19:00.821 --> 19:03.312
<i>- Obey your God.
- Defend your country.</i>

19:03.390 --> 19:05.087
<i>- Your God.
- Your country.</i>

19:05.258 --> 19:06.589
<i>- Your God.
- Your country.</i>

19:06.660 --> 19:07.549
<i>- God.
- Country.</i>

19:07.727 --> 19:08.751
<i>- God.
- Country.</i>

19:08.829 --> 19:10.194
<i>- God.
- Country...</i>

19:22.309 --> 19:24.903
"Render therefore unto Caesar

19:25.278 --> 19:27.610
"the things which were Caesar's,

19:28.181 --> 19:32.948
"and unto God
the things that were God's."

19:35.622 --> 19:38.420
Caesar... The things which were Caesar's.

19:41.194 --> 19:44.459
And unto God, God's.

20:01.548 --> 20:04.073
- Private York reporting, sir.
- Have him come in.

20:04.150 --> 20:06.209
Yes, sir. Go in, Sergeant.

20:10.423 --> 20:13.984
I'm a-bringing your book back, Major.
And I'm a-thanking you.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.994
Well, you're welcome, York.

20:16.062 --> 20:18.724
I done what you told me,
I thought things over.

20:18.798 --> 20:21.665
- Well?
- I'd like to stay in this here army.

20:22.302 --> 20:24.167
I rather hoped that you would, York.

20:24.237 --> 20:27.832
But there's just one thing, sir,
that I ought to tell you.

20:28.608 --> 20:29.802
There's lots of things...

20:29.876 --> 20:32.003
There's lots of things
I ain't figured out yet.

20:32.078 --> 20:34.979
Lots of things still a-going on in my mind.

20:35.081 --> 20:38.710
But it's...
Well, it's just like Pastor Pile done told me.

20:38.985 --> 20:43.684
I reckon I can just be a-trusting in
something that's a heap bigger than I be.

20:46.126 --> 20:51.063
York, as your superior officer, I don't feel
called upon to look into your conscience.

20:51.898 --> 20:54.423
It's enough for me that I trust you.

20:54.901 --> 20:58.564
And I believe that when the time comes,
you'll conduct yourself as a soldier should.

20:58.638 --> 20:59.900
Thank you, sir.

20:59.973 --> 21:03.807
And I'm going to approve your promotion
to the rank of corporal.

21:03.877 --> 21:07.677
Well, I'll sure take care of my men
the best I can, sir.

21:07.781 --> 21:09.612
I know you will, York.

21:10.216 --> 21:12.411
- That's all.
- Thank you, Major.

21:15.889 --> 21:19.689
Aren't you...
Aren't you taking quite a chance, Major?

21:20.193 --> 21:23.060
You mean as to whether he'll fight or not?

21:23.897 --> 21:26.127
No, I don't think so, Captain.

21:26.833 --> 21:29.768
I don't think I'm taking any chances at all.

21:38.144 --> 21:39.475
"Dear Mom,

21:39.813 --> 21:44.045
"am feeling just fine
and have taken in all the sights.

21:44.117 --> 21:48.611
"And Bert took me to a church
called Notre Dame Cathedral.

21:49.556 --> 21:54.016
"It's big enough inside for a fellow
to plant a crop of corn.

21:56.363 --> 21:58.092
"Pusher just come in.

21:58.164 --> 22:02.260
"He's saying our outfit is moving up
to front pretty soon.

22:02.869 --> 22:07.169
"I reckon that's so
'cause we got all our training

22:07.240 --> 22:11.108
"and they ain't brought us here
for no sight-seeing tour..."

22:11.177 --> 22:13.168
"Tour, nohow.

22:14.481 --> 22:17.848
"Gracie wrote in her letter
she was a-worrying.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.346
"Tell her, don't."

22:21.921 --> 22:24.947
I was feared. I'm a-feared for Alvin.

22:25.725 --> 22:28.717
It ain't right for us to be a-feared, Gracie.

22:30.096 --> 22:31.961
Alvin's in good hands.

22:33.366 --> 22:36.824
The Lord takes care of 'em
that's a-believing in Him.

23:07.333 --> 23:10.131
- Any of you blokes got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

23:10.437 --> 23:12.337
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

23:12.572 --> 23:15.336
You know, you Yanks just got here
in the nick of time.

23:15.408 --> 23:17.467
We're running shy of these.

23:17.877 --> 23:19.902
Besides, we can do with some help.

23:19.979 --> 23:21.241
Look out.

23:28.922 --> 23:32.858
It takes a while, but you'll learn
when to flop and when not to.

23:33.093 --> 23:35.687
They say you never hear
the one that's hit you.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.923
That's only half the truth.

23:37.997 --> 23:41.797
No, the whole truth is,
if you hears it, you've got a chance.

23:42.769 --> 23:43.861
Duck.

23:48.341 --> 23:49.706
See what I mean?

23:49.943 --> 23:54.175
- Heinie's got the range good.
- Yeah. A guy can get killed around here.

23:54.781 --> 23:58.239
- Look out.
- Don't be afraid. This one'll pass over.

24:00.420 --> 24:01.478
See?

24:04.591 --> 24:07.754
Takes time, it do.
But you'll get the hang of it.

24:08.728 --> 24:09.888
Duck again.

24:19.205 --> 24:22.732
If that was shrapnel, now,
we wouldn't be flopping at all.

24:22.809 --> 24:25.209
You know, you only flop for...

24:26.813 --> 24:29.441
Okay, Bert. The Express has gone through.

24:29.516 --> 24:30.847
Hey, Bert!

24:45.899 --> 24:49.596
If one's got your name on it,
there's nothing you can do.

25:02.749 --> 25:06.583
So you see, gentlemen,
the grave responsibility rests upon us.

25:07.453 --> 25:10.513
This entire German salient,
holding up the Argonne advance

25:10.590 --> 25:13.650
depends for ammunition and supplies
on the Decauville Railroad,

25:13.726 --> 25:16.422
which as you know,
lies just beyond these hills.

25:16.529 --> 25:17.826
It must be taken.

25:17.897 --> 25:19.330
This is all open country ahead,

25:19.399 --> 25:22.232
but you can expect heavy machinegun fire
from these wooded ridges

25:22.302 --> 25:26.204
on the right and the left flanks.
But we've got to get through.

25:26.806 --> 25:28.774
Synchronize your watches.

25:30.009 --> 25:32.944
Use as a mark, 4:32.

25:34.013 --> 25:37.449
It is now minus 10, eight, six,

25:37.951 --> 25:40.613
four, two, mark.

25:40.687 --> 25:41.745
Any questions?

25:41.821 --> 25:43.948
What about artillery support,
Captain Tillman?

25:44.023 --> 25:46.651
Artillery will lay down a rolling barrage
at 6:00.

25:46.726 --> 25:48.853
Zero hour will be 6:10.

25:53.933 --> 25:57.096
I'd like to know where that barrage is
that we're supposed to have.

25:57.170 --> 26:01.869
Runners, notify the platoon commanders
that we go over, barrage or no barrage.

26:01.941 --> 26:03.533
First platoon at 6:10,

26:03.610 --> 26:06.078
second and third platoons to follow
in waves of 100 meters.

26:06.145 --> 26:07.407
Yes, sir.

26:21.261 --> 26:23.161
- 6:10.
- 6:10. All right.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.416
Come on, men!

28:59.085 --> 29:00.575
Halt and take cover!

29:13.499 --> 29:15.057
We'll never get through.

29:17.203 --> 29:18.966
We gotta wipe out those nests.

29:19.038 --> 29:22.769
Early, take what's left of your section
and work your way back around that hill.

29:22.842 --> 29:24.469
Maybe you can jump 'em from behind.

29:24.544 --> 29:28.480
All right. Savage, York, Cutting.
Bring your men. Come with me.

29:59.011 --> 30:00.342
Take cover.

30:02.615 --> 30:03.775
Listen.

30:25.304 --> 30:26.498
Heinie!

30:27.673 --> 30:28.799
Listen.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.544
We're not far enough back.

30:34.614 --> 30:35.638
Savage, keep the men quiet.

30:35.715 --> 30:37.774
Cutting, come up here with that bayonet.

31:03.109 --> 31:07.409
We're right behind their lines.
We'll skirt this ridge and flank 'em.

31:08.281 --> 31:09.771
Look! Heinies!

31:10.550 --> 31:12.142
Come on, get 'em.

31:32.271 --> 31:33.431
Hold your fire!

31:33.506 --> 31:36.998
Fall on down and keep 'em covered.
Spread out, men! Spread out!

31:37.710 --> 31:39.337
Line 'em up and disarm 'em!

31:40.713 --> 31:42.340
- Get back there.
- Get 'em up there.

31:42.415 --> 31:43.643
Go on.

32:22.054 --> 32:24.352
- I'm hit bad, Cutting.
- Me, too.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.451
Savage.

32:27.426 --> 32:28.484
Savage?

32:29.095 --> 32:30.392
Where's Savage?

32:30.796 --> 32:33.594
I seen him go down.
They like to cut him in two.

32:33.666 --> 32:35.827
You're the only noncom left.

32:38.170 --> 32:40.570
York, take over.

32:41.107 --> 32:43.803
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you.

32:45.277 --> 32:46.938
Watch this fellow.

32:47.747 --> 32:50.113
The rest of you keep under cover.

32:51.984 --> 32:53.508
Come back here.

32:53.619 --> 32:56.645
- Where are you going?
- You done give me command.

33:41.767 --> 33:43.064
Hey, Alvin!

33:51.377 --> 33:53.538
Well, he cleaned out
that machine gun nest.

34:21.005 --> 34:23.235
Zeekenny, Donahue! The rest of you guys,

34:23.309 --> 34:25.777
keep your eye on them Heinies
so they don't try any rough stuff.

34:25.844 --> 34:27.540
Don't try anything funny.

34:27.612 --> 34:29.581
Belly to the ground, you babies.

34:29.648 --> 34:30.672
We better get up there.

34:30.750 --> 34:32.911
No, we better keep an eye
on these prisoners.

34:45.097 --> 34:48.089
Five will get you 10 that guy knocks off
your whole sauerkraut army.

34:48.167 --> 34:50.635
There are 25 machine guns on that ridge.

34:50.703 --> 34:53.034
- Tell him it's useless.
- What did you say?

34:53.105 --> 34:54.663
I said tell him it's useless.

34:54.739 --> 34:58.039
You tell him.
You talk better English than I do.

35:19.198 --> 35:21.393
Just like a flock of turkeys.

35:46.192 --> 35:49.127
All right. Come on out of there! All of you!

35:50.729 --> 35:52.219
Come this a-way.

35:57.303 --> 36:00.636
Tell the rest of them fellows
to quit shooting and come on out of there.

36:04.977 --> 36:08.504
Keep 'em hands up
and start a-going down the hill there.

36:11.550 --> 36:12.915
Keep a-coming.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.582
Go on. Move out of there, down the hill.

36:19.792 --> 36:21.760
All right. Keep a-coming.

36:22.962 --> 36:25.453
Hey, down there. Don't do no shooting.

36:25.564 --> 36:27.088
All right, get on down!

36:29.568 --> 36:31.832
Come on out and keep your hands up.

36:31.904 --> 36:33.462
Boy, I told you.

36:38.944 --> 36:40.002
Look at that mob.

36:40.079 --> 36:41.740
Hey, we can't handle all that gang.

36:41.814 --> 36:43.441
Sure we can. That's my mate.

36:43.515 --> 36:45.779
Come on, step lively. Move forward.

36:45.851 --> 36:47.216
Get going.

36:47.686 --> 36:49.779
- Move forward.
- Move it, now.

36:51.290 --> 36:52.518
Move forward, there.

36:52.591 --> 36:55.116
Come on, step up. Step lively there.
Come on.

36:59.131 --> 37:01.497
- All right.
- Get those hands up. Get in there.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.762
- Come on.
- Come on, get going.

37:03.836 --> 37:05.167
Nice going, York.

37:05.237 --> 37:08.331
- Come on there. Come on.
- Come on, get in there.

37:08.607 --> 37:11.633
Get those hands up.
Come on, move fast. Move.

37:11.710 --> 37:13.769
- Hiya, Pusher.
- That was a good job, pal.

37:13.846 --> 37:17.111
- Where's the Sergeant?
- Over there. Hurt pretty bad.

37:17.750 --> 37:20.514
- How many men we got left?
- Eight, besides you.

37:23.622 --> 37:24.884
Watch them fellows.

37:24.957 --> 37:26.925
Get in there, you guys.
Move forward. Move...

37:35.067 --> 37:36.193
Pusher.

37:36.869 --> 37:38.097
Pusher.

37:38.671 --> 37:41.196
This is where we change cars, Alvin.

37:43.442 --> 37:45.205
The end of the line.

37:53.218 --> 37:55.880
Who done that?
Who throwed that grenade?

38:01.126 --> 38:04.220
Come on, you, put your hands up
and keep 'em up.

38:05.564 --> 38:07.191
You know what I'm a-saying?

38:07.266 --> 38:08.858
- You understand?
- Yeah.

38:08.934 --> 38:11.164
Tell 'em men of yours
if any more of that happens

38:11.236 --> 38:14.467
you and a lot more of 'em's
going to be mighty sorry.

38:14.540 --> 38:15.768
Go ahead.

38:18.444 --> 38:20.139
Tell 'em to drop their belts.

38:26.752 --> 38:28.845
Look them fellows over good.

38:32.191 --> 38:34.318
- You ready back there?
- Okay here.

38:34.393 --> 38:36.884
- Okay. Ready here.
- Watch 'em.

38:40.799 --> 38:42.198
Now, get going.

38:59.018 --> 39:00.713
Tell 'em to halt.

39:03.589 --> 39:05.489
If you wanted to get back
to the American lines,

39:05.557 --> 39:07.855
which way would you be a-going?

39:07.926 --> 39:09.188
Up there.

39:10.129 --> 39:12.256
We'll go this a-way. Go on.

39:22.908 --> 39:24.773
Hey, tell 'em to halt.

39:26.912 --> 39:27.970
What's up?

39:28.047 --> 39:30.811
Sounds like them Heinies
is making a heap of trouble.

39:33.052 --> 39:35.885
- What are we gonna do about it?
- Get 'em.

39:36.121 --> 39:37.952
We got enough to take care of already.

39:38.023 --> 39:39.718
And a few more won't make no difference.

39:39.792 --> 39:41.020
Hey, you.

39:41.293 --> 39:43.727
Signal up there
and tell 'em they're surrounded.

39:43.796 --> 39:47.732
Tell 'em to drop their guns
and come down with their hands up.

39:49.368 --> 39:52.303
Hey, this gun touches off kind of easy.

40:40.452 --> 40:42.784
They sure are trained good, Major.

40:44.890 --> 40:46.619
Hey, Sarge, look.

40:47.159 --> 40:49.320
- Looks like Heinies.
- Stand ready.

40:51.396 --> 40:52.886
Hello, there!

40:53.065 --> 40:55.329
- A Yank.
- It may be some kind of a trick.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.664
- There's something funny here.
- Let 'em get a little closer.

40:57.736 --> 40:59.670
- Hello there!
- Who are you?

40:59.738 --> 41:03.105
Detail of the 328th.
We got some prisoners.

41:04.109 --> 41:06.134
- Halt where you are.
- Halt!

41:07.112 --> 41:08.545
That's a Yank, all right.

41:08.614 --> 41:11.811
- Come out, let's have a look at you.
- Watch 'em, fellows!

41:17.789 --> 41:19.416
Keep 'em covered.

41:22.194 --> 41:23.525
Where you going?

41:23.595 --> 41:26.223
Can you tell me where the 328th be?

41:26.298 --> 41:27.890
It's up that way someplace.

41:27.966 --> 41:31.424
- Where did you pick up all this bunch?
- Back up the line a ways.

41:31.503 --> 41:33.733
You couldn't be taking 'em off our hands,
could you?

41:33.805 --> 41:35.602
What would we do with them?

41:35.841 --> 41:37.604
Well, I don't rightly know.

41:37.676 --> 41:39.644
- Can we be going?
- Sure. Go ahead.

41:39.711 --> 41:40.973
Thank you.

41:42.047 --> 41:43.071
Come on.

41:43.148 --> 41:44.376
Forward!

42:03.869 --> 42:05.200
All right. Halt!

42:05.270 --> 42:07.067
Prisoners, hold right there!

42:08.140 --> 42:09.971
Be a-watching 'em, Joe.

42:17.349 --> 42:19.078
Beg your pardon, sir.

42:19.351 --> 42:20.409
Yeah?

42:20.485 --> 42:23.886
We all got some prisoners,
can we be a-leaving 'em here?

42:24.556 --> 42:26.547
Put 'em right over there.

42:28.060 --> 42:29.493
Wait a minute.

42:30.495 --> 42:31.587
How many have you got?

42:31.663 --> 42:34.063
Well, I done counted 132 heads, sir.

42:34.132 --> 42:37.295
We haven't room for that many here.
Take them back up the line.

42:37.369 --> 42:39.462
- Yes, sir, but...
- But what?

42:39.638 --> 42:44.007
Well, sir, we can't find our outfit and we
tried to drop 'em off two other places.

42:44.076 --> 42:46.135
And they ain't but only eight of us
to handle them.

42:46.211 --> 42:50.511
- You should've brought more men.
- But that's all there were of us, sir.

42:51.183 --> 42:54.050
You mean to say that you
and seven others captured all that bunch?

42:54.119 --> 42:57.316
Yes, sir.
And we'd kind of like to get rid of 'em.

42:57.823 --> 42:59.814
Well, good Lord.

43:00.759 --> 43:02.556
I guess we can give you some help.

43:02.628 --> 43:04.562
- Come on, Sergeant.
- Thank you.

43:11.169 --> 43:14.605
Hey, Sarge! York by himself
captured 132 Germans.

43:14.673 --> 43:18.404
Guy named York got 132 Heinies
all by his lonesome.

43:18.477 --> 43:20.672
- How did he do it?
- Must have surrounded him.

43:20.746 --> 43:23.112
- Guy named York.
- That's what they say.

43:23.181 --> 43:25.979
Gee, he captured
hundreds of Boche and machine guns.

43:26.051 --> 43:29.020
Guy named York! All by his lonesome!

43:29.087 --> 43:30.884
Hey, what's that? How many?

43:30.956 --> 43:33.151
A whole division and a lot of high officers.

43:33.225 --> 43:35.625
- I'm telling you, York?
- Who's they?

43:35.694 --> 43:37.685
Yeah, about half the German army
and a general.

43:37.763 --> 43:39.128
- I don't know.
- One guy.

43:39.197 --> 43:40.425
How could one guy...

43:40.499 --> 43:42.729
- Guy named York.
- What's that?

43:42.801 --> 43:45.133
They say he captured Hindenburg.
And the Crown Prince.

43:45.203 --> 43:47.637
And brought them all back. They say...

43:53.779 --> 43:57.044
Say, Sarge, did you hear?
York captured the Kaiser.

44:00.485 --> 44:03.352
Now, as I understand it, York,
your detail came over that ridge there

44:03.422 --> 44:05.390
and captured about 30 men,
right down in here.

44:05.457 --> 44:06.481
Yes, sir.

44:06.558 --> 44:08.389
Then you were forced to cover
by a machine gun

44:08.460 --> 44:10.621
that was right up on this other ridge.

44:10.696 --> 44:12.687
Yes, sir. Right up there.

44:13.498 --> 44:14.624
Where were you?

44:14.700 --> 44:17.999
Well, I was...
I was a-laying behind that log there.

44:18.570 --> 44:22.700
They was machine-gunning us
pretty heavy, so I worked my way across

44:23.141 --> 44:25.871
up behind that log there under the hill.

44:27.579 --> 44:29.376
Rather incredible, wasn't it, York,

44:29.448 --> 44:32.349
your being able to cross so much
open ground without being hit?

44:32.417 --> 44:35.443
I reckon the good Lord
was a-protecting me, sir.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.545
What did you wanna go over there for?

44:37.622 --> 44:39.385
Well, I figured that was a good place to be

44:39.458 --> 44:42.154
because they had to rear up
and show themselves

44:42.227 --> 44:44.752
in order to shoot at me
and the rest of the boys back here.

44:44.830 --> 44:46.695
And whenever they did,
I could touch 'em off.

44:46.765 --> 44:47.789
I see.

44:47.866 --> 44:51.632
So, I went up the hill,
up around that a-way,

44:52.003 --> 44:55.700
then worked my way down the ridge
to a place where they was flanked

44:55.774 --> 44:58.470
and couldn't show themselves
without being hit.

44:58.577 --> 45:01.137
So, they... Well, they finally gave up.

45:01.213 --> 45:03.078
How many did you kill?

45:04.282 --> 45:06.182
I don't rightly know, sir.

45:06.251 --> 45:08.481
I think Captain Danforth
is familiar with that, sir.

45:08.553 --> 45:11.989
We counted about 20 bodies altogether
up around there.

45:12.991 --> 45:15.186
What were your men doing
all this time, Corporal?

45:15.260 --> 45:16.784
Well, I couldn't just answer that, sir.

45:16.862 --> 45:19.763
I was pretty busy
and I reckon they was, too.

45:19.965 --> 45:23.332
According to the statements of the others,
they were guarding the prisoners

45:23.402 --> 45:26.894
and couldn't expose themselves
to the fire from the ridge.

45:26.972 --> 45:29.873
All right, gentlemen. That's all, Corporal.

45:34.646 --> 45:35.908
Corporal.

45:37.549 --> 45:40.848
- There's something that I'd like to know.
- Yes, sir?

45:41.052 --> 45:43.714
That night that you reported back to me
at Camp Gordon,

45:43.789 --> 45:47.054
you as much as told me that you were
quite prepared to die for your country,

45:47.125 --> 45:48.717
but not to kill.

45:49.961 --> 45:52.725
What made you
decide to change your mind?

45:53.131 --> 45:54.564
Well, sir...

45:54.666 --> 45:57.794
Of course, if you'd rather not tell me,
why, it's quite all right.

45:57.869 --> 46:00.565
Well, I'm as much against killing as ever,
sir.

46:00.705 --> 46:02.639
But it was this way, Colonel.

46:03.041 --> 46:05.737
When I started out I felt just like you said.

46:05.811 --> 46:07.904
But when I hear them
machine guns a-going

46:07.979 --> 46:10.470
and all them fellows
are dropping around me,

46:10.582 --> 46:14.643
I figured that them guns
was killing hundreds, maybe thousands,

46:14.719 --> 46:17.916
and there weren't nothing anybody
could do, but to stop them guns.

46:17.989 --> 46:19.854
And that's what I done.

46:20.492 --> 46:23.120
You mean to tell me
that you did it to save lives?

46:23.195 --> 46:25.663
Yes, sir. That was why.

46:28.567 --> 46:33.197
Well, York, what you've just told me
is the most extraordinary thing of all.

46:35.574 --> 46:37.064
<i>Sergeant York!</i>

47:05.737 --> 47:07.261
Thank you, sir.

47:08.440 --> 47:11.500
And for conspicuous gallantry
beyond the call of duty,

47:11.576 --> 47:14.977
you have been awarded
the Distinguished Service Cross.

47:20.252 --> 47:23.744
Sergeant York, I am proud that
you are of the All-American Division.

47:23.822 --> 47:26.689
It's a privilege to command
such men as you.

47:30.695 --> 47:32.162
Sergeant York,

47:32.230 --> 47:35.996
as Commander-in-Chief
of the American Expeditionary Forces,

47:36.067 --> 47:38.695
it is my pleasure to confer upon you

47:38.770 --> 47:41.261
the United States
Congressional Medal of Honor

47:41.339 --> 47:43.830
for heroism beyond the call of duty.

47:46.077 --> 47:47.601
Thank you, sir.

48:14.506 --> 48:16.303
I'm Cordell Hull, Sergeant York,

48:16.374 --> 48:18.274
representative from
your district of Tennessee.

48:18.343 --> 48:20.470
I'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Hull.

48:20.545 --> 48:22.979
And this is Mr. Harrison
from the Tennessee Society.

48:23.048 --> 48:24.982
Tennessee is indeed proud, Sergeant.

48:25.050 --> 48:27.075
- Thank you.
- This way, Sergeant.

48:39.030 --> 48:41.624
Well, Sergeant, what do you think of it?

48:41.700 --> 48:44.965
Appears like everybody's
having a mighty good time.

48:45.236 --> 48:47.796
So, Sergeant,
in the name of the people of New York,

48:47.872 --> 48:50.340
may I present you with this key to our city

48:50.408 --> 48:52.933
as a token of our very great esteem.

48:53.078 --> 48:54.943
And may God bless you.

48:57.282 --> 48:58.544
Thank you for what you said,

48:58.617 --> 49:01.381
and I'm sure grateful to you
for this here key.

49:01.453 --> 49:03.944
Well, thank you. And thank you all.

49:05.757 --> 49:09.193
Now, Sergeant, the people of New York
would like to show their appreciation.

49:09.260 --> 49:11.023
Is there anything we can do for you?

49:11.096 --> 49:13.121
Well, there's just one thing
I'd like to ask you.

49:13.198 --> 49:14.324
And that is?

49:14.399 --> 49:15.923
Well, if it's all the same to everybody,

49:16.001 --> 49:19.835
I sure would like to ride on the subway
on the Bronx Express.

49:20.305 --> 49:21.533
I think we can arrange that.

49:25.910 --> 49:27.537
Well, here we are.

49:32.117 --> 49:34.915
I hope you will be comfortable here,
Sergeant York.

49:34.986 --> 49:36.851
Well, if it ain't, I'd be pretty hard to please.

49:36.921 --> 49:39.754
If there's anything you require,
all you will have to do is ask for it.

49:39.824 --> 49:41.724
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

49:42.794 --> 49:45.786
An awful lot of room
for just one fellow here.

50:01.346 --> 50:04.247
This here is mighty thoughtful of you,
gentlemen.

50:04.315 --> 50:07.113
I reckon you know I ain't seen my ma
for quite a spell.

50:07.185 --> 50:09.312
So we understand.

50:15.493 --> 50:17.256
Representative Hull.

50:18.363 --> 50:20.558
Oh, yes, yes. Are they ready?

50:21.332 --> 50:22.731
Put them on.

50:22.967 --> 50:25.333
- Somebody for you, Sergeant.
- Me?

50:28.573 --> 50:29.938
Thank you.

50:33.211 --> 50:35.270
Hello. Hello there.

50:38.483 --> 50:39.575
What?

50:41.453 --> 50:42.784
Who is it?

50:45.557 --> 50:47.422
I... I can't hear you.

50:48.460 --> 50:51.088
- Who is it?
- What's that you're saying?

50:51.429 --> 50:52.760
I can't hear you.

50:52.831 --> 50:54.799
Put it up to your ear, Mother York.

50:54.866 --> 50:56.299
Stand closer, Ma.

50:56.367 --> 50:58.699
When are you coming home, Alvin?

50:59.370 --> 51:03.101
I said, when are you coming home?

51:06.344 --> 51:08.005
Oh, I'm glad, Son.

51:09.748 --> 51:11.238
I'll tell her.

51:11.649 --> 51:13.310
She's right here.

51:14.219 --> 51:16.585
He wants to talk to you, Gracie.

51:18.556 --> 51:21.081
It's me, Alvin. It's me, Gracie!

51:21.526 --> 51:24.051
We're all in here in Pastor Pile's store.

51:24.129 --> 51:26.620
He's got this here phone in here now.

51:26.698 --> 51:29.531
Oh, I just can't wait to see you again,
Alvin.

51:29.701 --> 51:31.692
I can't wait to see you.

51:31.770 --> 51:35.069
Yeah, yeah. I'll be coming home, Gracie,
right away.

51:35.573 --> 51:36.665
Yeah.

51:37.509 --> 51:40.876
- Goodbye. Goodbye, Gracie.
- Goodbye, Alvin.

51:42.413 --> 51:43.471
Bye.

51:52.090 --> 51:54.320
Sure was nice to talk to the folks.

51:54.392 --> 51:56.792
- I'm a-thanking you.
- You're welcome, Sergeant.

52:21.853 --> 52:24.788
Just like the electric signs
down the street.

52:27.659 --> 52:31.493
How do you like New York, Alvin,
as much as you've seen of it?

52:32.130 --> 52:33.995
- Mr. Hull?
- Yes, Alvin?

52:35.099 --> 52:37.067
I wanna be a-going home.

52:37.602 --> 52:39.069
When do you think I can go?

52:39.137 --> 52:41.970
- You're pretty anxious, I reckon.
- Yes, sir, I am.

52:42.841 --> 52:44.399
I've got to get to work.

52:44.475 --> 52:47.808
Well, as far as that goes,
there's plenty to do right here, Alvin.

52:47.879 --> 52:48.868
What do you mean?

52:48.947 --> 52:51.347
I've been wanting
to talk to you about this.

52:51.416 --> 52:53.407
You're a pretty famous man now.

52:53.484 --> 52:56.112
And judging by all these offers
you've been getting,

52:56.187 --> 52:58.417
it seems a lot of people realize it.

52:58.489 --> 52:59.956
For instance,

53:00.425 --> 53:03.258
two companies want you
in motion pictures,

53:03.328 --> 53:06.024
<i>Ziegfeld wants you in an act
in his new Follies.</i>

53:06.097 --> 53:09.294
And here's an offer to appear
at the Winter Garden, that's a theater.

53:09.367 --> 53:13.394
And here's a breakfast food manufacturer
who wants you to endorse his product.

53:13.471 --> 53:15.234
What does that mean?

53:15.940 --> 53:20.468
Well, you've to tell him how much
you like it, how much good it's done you.

53:21.112 --> 53:24.138
I ain't never ate
any of that there breakfast food.

53:24.215 --> 53:26.012
Doesn't seem to make any difference.

53:26.084 --> 53:28.575
Anyway, I've totaled the offers so far

53:28.653 --> 53:31.622
and they amount to around
a quarter of million dollars.

53:31.689 --> 53:33.748
They're offering me all that money?

53:33.825 --> 53:36.521
It's just a plain business proposition.

53:37.195 --> 53:40.323
I sure could do a powerful sight
with that money.

53:40.498 --> 53:42.989
There was a piece of bottomland
I was a-trying to get...

53:43.067 --> 53:45.297
Here's your chance to get it.

53:47.105 --> 53:50.666
Are they offering that money
because of what happened over there?

53:50.742 --> 53:53.176
- Well...
- That's it, ain't it?

53:54.512 --> 53:55.843
That's it.

53:57.248 --> 53:59.773
What... What would you do, Mr. Hull?

54:01.452 --> 54:03.818
Well, I think that's up to you, Alvin.

54:04.188 --> 54:05.712
I reckon it is.

54:05.890 --> 54:08.825
Take all the time you want to think it over.

54:09.127 --> 54:11.459
I've done thought it over, Mr. Hull.

54:11.529 --> 54:14.362
I ain't proud of what happened over there.

54:14.499 --> 54:17.696
What we done in France
was something we had to do.

54:17.802 --> 54:20.600
Some fellows done it ain't a-coming back.

54:21.572 --> 54:25.736
So, the way I figure,
things like that ain't for buying and selling.

54:25.843 --> 54:27.504
So I reckon I'll have to refuse 'em.

54:27.578 --> 54:30.672
Would you be a-telling them that
for me, please?

54:30.848 --> 54:33.146
And tell 'em I'm a-going home?

54:36.487 --> 54:40.014
- I'll be more than glad to, Alvin.
- Thank you, Mr. Hull.

54:46.464 --> 54:48.989
Here she comes, Zeke. Right on time.

55:00.745 --> 55:02.337
Oh, there he is!

55:18.463 --> 55:19.657
Alvin!

55:19.731 --> 55:21.289
Oh, Alvin!

55:21.866 --> 55:23.060
How are you?

55:44.722 --> 55:46.189
Ma, I'm back.

55:47.191 --> 55:49.421
I'm right glad, Son.

55:52.497 --> 55:54.931
Hey, Alvin. How about your medals?

55:55.199 --> 55:58.293
- What about 'em, George?
- I thought you'd be wearing 'em.

55:58.369 --> 55:59.597
You'll be a-seeing 'em.

55:59.670 --> 56:02.104
They better be a-something big.

56:02.340 --> 56:03.671
As I was saying, Alvin,

56:03.741 --> 56:07.177
of course, I always figured
on marrying you and Gracie myself,

56:07.245 --> 56:10.180
but I ain't one to take the job away
from the Governor of the State.

56:10.248 --> 56:12.910
Why, you're the dang-swangest hero
raised in these parts

56:12.984 --> 56:14.747
since Daniel Boone and Andy Jackson.

56:14.819 --> 56:16.184
Sure are, Alvin.

56:16.854 --> 56:18.378
Hang on, Rosie.

56:20.691 --> 56:21.715
Hey,

56:22.260 --> 56:25.787
what about that there piece of land
I was aiming to get in Tomkins holler?

56:25.863 --> 56:28.354
- It's still there, I reckon?
- Yep, it's still there.

56:28.433 --> 56:30.993
Somebody else has got it by now,
I suppose.

56:31.069 --> 56:35.130
Well, I couldn't rightly expect Zeb
to hold it for me all this time.

56:35.206 --> 56:37.572
I sure would like to see that there
piece of land, though.

56:37.642 --> 56:39.872
I reckon ain't no harm you seeing it, Alvin.

56:39.944 --> 56:42.037
I'd like to be a-seeing it, too.

56:42.613 --> 56:46.071
I'll let you off at the fork and
you and Gracie can walk over to the holler.

56:47.485 --> 56:49.146
Hang on, everyone.

56:52.757 --> 56:54.281
Hey, look here.

56:56.094 --> 56:59.825
- Somebody's done fixed up this old bridge.
- Yeah, they have.

57:00.665 --> 57:03.099
Gracie, I... I gotta talk to you.

57:03.668 --> 57:05.533
It wasn't just the land
I was a-wanting to see.

57:05.603 --> 57:08.265
There's something we got to talk about.

57:08.406 --> 57:11.569
- Miss Gracie, I'm plumb worried.
- What about, Alvin?

57:11.642 --> 57:13.507
Well, what with the governor fixing
to marry us

57:13.578 --> 57:15.273
and all them people coming here
from all over...

57:15.346 --> 57:18.804
Sure takes a body's breath away,
but I reckon we'll get through it all right.

57:18.883 --> 57:22.250
- Well, it ain't just that I'm worried about.
- Well, what then?

57:22.320 --> 57:26.518
Well, it sure looks like I ain't got nothing
to offer you excepting a big wedding.

57:26.591 --> 57:28.855
Why, some girls don't even get that.

57:29.360 --> 57:32.454
Well, I reckon you'd like a place to sleep,
wouldn't you?

57:32.530 --> 57:33.997
Oh, I don't know.

57:34.065 --> 57:36.329
I done a heap of sleeping
while you was away.

57:36.400 --> 57:39.460
You sure ain't expecting
too much of a husband.

57:39.704 --> 57:41.797
I'm expecting my husband to love me.

57:41.873 --> 57:44.398
I reckon the good Lord
will take care of the rest.

57:44.475 --> 57:46.966
Well, looks like he's done a heap already,

57:47.044 --> 57:49.035
just a-having you. But...

57:49.280 --> 57:52.909
Well, I was expecting to take over
from here myself.

57:52.984 --> 57:55.578
I reckon you'll get to do your share.

57:56.187 --> 57:58.951
No, Gracie, it can't be that a-way.

57:59.490 --> 58:00.479
We got to wait.

58:00.558 --> 58:03.857
Maybe in another two or three years,
if you're willing to wait...

58:03.928 --> 58:05.793
Oh, but I ain't, that's the point.

58:05.863 --> 58:09.492
- You mean you won't wait?
- There ain't no need of waiting.

58:09.934 --> 58:13.563
Now, Alvin, you keep looking down
and don't you be looking up till I tell you.

58:14.572 --> 58:15.800
Come on.

58:21.779 --> 58:23.770
There! Now you can look.

58:24.415 --> 58:26.747
What do you see, Alvin? Tell me.

58:27.018 --> 58:29.987
It's yours, Alvin. It's all yours.
They give it to you.

58:30.054 --> 58:32.887
The people of the state of Tennessee
for what you done.

58:32.957 --> 58:34.891
- You mean...
- Only, it's 200 acres

58:34.959 --> 58:39.020
and the house is bigger, with more
windows, and the kitchen's got a pump.

58:39.697 --> 58:41.289
And it's for us.

58:46.871 --> 58:49.704
The Lord sure does move
in mysterious ways.

58:51.042 --> 58:52.270
Come on.
