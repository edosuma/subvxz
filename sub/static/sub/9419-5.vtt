02:53.107 --> 02:54.740
<i>Kind of set off your alarm?</i>

02:54.742 --> 02:56.909
<i>>> so last year, I was working</i>

02:56.911 --> 02:59.845
<i>On a film called</i> <i>raze,</i> and when

02:59.847 --> 03:01.446
You're doing independent movies,

03:01.448 --> 03:03.549
You really depend on your fan

03:03.551 --> 03:04.216
Base.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.417
And she was just awesome.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.485
She was smart.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.920
She was funny.

03:07.922 --> 03:08.787
She was a really, really clever

03:08.789 --> 03:09.454
Girl.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.390
Her videos were funny, and she

03:11.392 --> 03:12.357
Cooked me.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.859
I was gonna hire this girl.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.627
I got that close to her.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.895
And then she introduced me to

03:16.897 --> 03:20.032
Her friend, reese.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.401
And reese was, like, quieter.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.002
She was very devoted, and she

03:24.004 --> 03:25.504
And sammie became, like, this

03:25.506 --> 03:26.972
Dynamic duo for us and our

03:26.974 --> 03:27.873
Movie.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.508
Then reese said something like,

03:29.510 --> 03:30.876
"I hope I get to meet tracie

03:30.878 --> 03:33.445
Before it's too late."

03:33.447 --> 03:34.279
I d.M.'d reese, I'm like,

03:34.281 --> 03:34.947
"what's happening?

03:34.949 --> 03:35.614
What's going on?"

03:35.616 --> 03:36.682
And then she's like,

03:36.684 --> 03:37.549
"oh, I'm sorry.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.517
I didn't mean for you to see

03:38.519 --> 03:39.184
That.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.753
But, okay, I have cancer."

03:41.755 --> 03:43.388
Then suddenly, things turned for

03:43.390 --> 03:44.890
The worse, and then sammie

03:44.892 --> 03:46.758
D.M.'d me, like, "reese passed

03:46.760 --> 03:49.494
Away."

03:49.496 --> 03:50.963
Oh, my god, really?

03:50.965 --> 03:52.798
That was fast.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.901
But that's really upsetting.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.202
And then, maybe a half an hour

03:57.204 --> 03:58.870
Later, sammie's like,

03:58.872 --> 03:59.538
"are you okay?

03:59.540 --> 04:01.306
How are you doing?"

04:01.308 --> 04:03.275
I'm like, "how are <i>you</i> doing?

04:03.277 --> 04:04.643
That's your best friend.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.510
Why are you asking me

04:05.512 --> 04:06.178
How I'm doing?"

04:06.180 --> 04:06.845
>> wow.

04:06.847 --> 04:07.846
>> just something there.

04:07.848 --> 04:08.747
And I was like, "something's not

04:08.749 --> 04:09.414
Right.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.749
I don't know what it is.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.451
And then, dead reese just

04:12.453 --> 04:15.587
Favorited her own r.I.P. Tweet.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.322
>> so someone signed into

04:17.324 --> 04:19.690
Reese's profile after she

04:19.692 --> 04:20.591
"died."

04:20.594 --> 04:21.360
>> right.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.427
Then an hour later,

04:22.429 --> 04:23.528
Unfavorited it.

04:23.530 --> 04:24.796
And turns out, through all of

04:24.798 --> 04:26.498
Our digging, reese doesn't

04:26.500 --> 04:27.165
Exist.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.901
There was no reese.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.304
Sammie made her up and gave her

04:32.306 --> 04:36.174
Cancer and killed her for

04:36.176 --> 04:37.776
Attention.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.910
>> jesus.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.512
>> you know, part of me is

04:40.514 --> 04:41.780
Worried about her.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.982
We were very, very good friends.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.217
It just got really dark

04:45.219 --> 04:49.121
And--and, like, twisted.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.923
I need to know.

04:51.925 --> 04:55.327
Is she still lurking around?

04:55.329 --> 04:57.496
Is she stalking other people?

04:57.498 --> 04:59.564
Is she stalking me?

04:59.566 --> 05:01.366
>> the good news is we live in

05:01.368 --> 05:02.434
Los angeles.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.736
We would love to fly back there

05:04.738 --> 05:06.338
And talk about this, and you can

05:06.340 --> 05:07.205
Really show us everything that

05:07.207 --> 05:08.840
You have and we can sort of

05:08.842 --> 05:10.442
Come up with a strategy, figure

05:10.444 --> 05:11.510

05:11.512 --> 05:12.411
It's definitely gonna be an

05:12.413 --> 05:13.078
Adventure.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.561
You have some exchanges,

06:07.735 --> 06:09.901
Sammie started being a super fan

06:09.903 --> 06:11.737
For our film <i>raze.</i>

06:11.739 --> 06:13.805
<i>And I had, like, kind of a soft</i>

06:13.807 --> 06:15.374
<i>Spot in my heart for sammie</i>

06:15.376 --> 06:17.576
<i>Because she was very sweet, very</i>

06:17.578 --> 06:18.310
<i>Talented.</i>

06:18.312 --> 06:19.244
<i>She made little movies, little</i>

06:19.246 --> 06:20.045
<i>Shorts, and they were always</i>

06:20.047 --> 06:20.712
<i>Really good.</i>

06:20.714 --> 06:21.513
<i>And we had this really kind of</i>

06:21.515 --> 06:22.280
<i>Cool friendship.</i>

06:22.282 --> 06:23.482
<i>>> and it was through sammie</i>

<i>That you met reese.</i>

06:24.551 --> 06:25.217
<i>>> yes.</i>

06:25.219 --> 06:26.618
<i>>> and then reese came at you</i>

06:29.723 --> 06:31.223
<i>It was very strange because</i>

06:31.225 --> 06:33.291
<i>I got more emotionally invested</i>

06:33.293 --> 06:35.727
<i>In reese than I had been in--in</i>

06:35.729 --> 06:36.762
<i>Sammie's personal life.</i>

06:36.764 --> 06:38.497

<i>Is that I wasn't the only one</i>

06:43.670 --> 06:45.804
<i>Talking to my friend, lotti.</i>

06:45.806 --> 06:47.139
<i>And she's producing a film</i>

06:47.141 --> 06:49.141
<i>Called</i> <i>chastity bites.</i>

06:49.143 --> 06:51.643
<i>Lotti got very, very close to</i>

06:51.645 --> 06:52.677
<i>Sammie and reese.</i>

06:52.679 --> 06:54.179
<i>'cause as a producer, these are</i>

06:54.181 --> 06:56.348
<i>The golden superstars,</i>

06:56.350 --> 06:57.516
<i>The people that go out into the</i>

06:57.518 --> 06:58.784
<i>World and talk about it and</i>

06:58.786 --> 06:59.451
<i>Tweet about it.</i>

06:59.453 --> 07:01.286
<i>So just look at this top part</i>

07:01.288 --> 07:02.053
<i>Right here.</i>

07:02.055 --> 07:02.921
<i>"have you talked to reese</i>

07:02.923 --> 07:03.622
<i>Today?"</i>

07:03.624 --> 07:04.489
<i>I didn't answer.</i>

07:04.491 --> 07:05.824
<i>Then the next day,</i>

07:05.826 --> 07:07.259
<i>"she died this morning."</i>

07:07.261 --> 07:08.927
<i>"oh, my god, I'm so sorry.</i>

07:08.929 --> 07:11.463
<i>Why did it happen that fast?"</i>

07:11.465 --> 07:13.532
<i>So a couple days later, she sent</i>

07:13.534 --> 07:15.133
<i>Us this.</i>

07:15.135 --> 07:16.768
<i>"here's a little video."</i>

07:16.770 --> 07:18.170
<i>And this used to play.</i>

07:18.172 --> 07:19.771
<i>So first of all, she's taking</i>

07:19.773 --> 07:21.807
<i>Video at her best friend's</i>

07:21.809 --> 07:24.176
<i>Funeral, which is already weird.</i>

07:24.178 --> 07:25.410
<i>And you start to see the casket</i>

07:25.412 --> 07:27.245
<i>Coming out, and then it cuts.</i>

07:27.247 --> 07:29.981
<i>She's outside behind a car.</i>

07:29.983 --> 07:32.284
<i>Then sammie tweets this funeral</i>

07:32.286 --> 07:33.552
<i>Banner.</i>

07:33.554 --> 07:34.519
<i>And she's like, "today's the</i>

07:34.521 --> 07:35.687
<i>Day."</i>

07:35.689 --> 07:36.755
<i>>> that goes on the car</i>

07:36.757 --> 07:37.422
<i>Rearview--</i>

07:37.424 --> 07:38.156
<i>>> it goes on a car.</i>

07:38.158 --> 07:39.324
<i>I zoomed in.</i>

07:39.326 --> 07:41.560
<i>Then I was like, "I know how I'm</i>

07:41.562 --> 07:42.694
<i>Gonna get you."</i>

07:42.696 --> 07:45.330
<i>You can get right in there.</i>

07:45.332 --> 07:46.798
<i>Emmett golden hunt memorial</i>

07:46.800 --> 07:48.033
<i>Chapel.</i>

07:48.035 --> 07:49.100
<i>And there's, like, the phone</i>

07:49.102 --> 07:50.068
<i>Number.</i>

07:50.070 --> 07:51.536
<i>And they say,</i>

07:51.538 --> 07:54.239
<i>"no reese."</i>

07:54.241 --> 07:56.107
<i>>> could that be her nickname?</i>

07:56.109 --> 07:58.643
<i>>> yeah, so then I say to her,</i>

07:58.645 --> 08:01.079
<i>"god, I've gotten so invested in</i>

08:01.081 --> 08:01.847
<i>Reese.</i>

08:01.849 --> 08:03.248
<i>I feel like I know so little</i>

08:03.250 --> 08:04.015
<i>About her.</i>

08:04.017 --> 08:06.284
<i>Do you have an obituary?"</i>

08:06.286 --> 08:07.619
<i>And then she said, "I can't</i>

08:07.621 --> 08:09.554
<i>Really get it right now.</i>

08:09.556 --> 08:13.291
<i>Give me your address, and I'll</i>

08:13.293 --> 08:15.527
<i>Send it to you."</i>

08:15.529 --> 08:17.262
<i>So then I said, "no, it's fine.</i>

08:17.264 --> 08:17.929
<i>Just twitpic it."</i>

08:17.931 --> 08:18.597
<i>>> yeah.</i>

08:18.599 --> 08:20.131
<i>>> and then nothing.</i>

08:20.133 --> 08:21.433
<i>She got tipped off.</i>

08:21.435 --> 08:23.235
<i>And then, I remembered this</i>

08:23.237 --> 08:23.935
<i>Other thing.</i>

08:23.937 --> 08:25.470
<i>Sammie had a death scare of her</i>

08:25.472 --> 08:27.939
<i>Own a few months ago, with some</i>

08:27.941 --> 08:29.341
<i>Other girl tweeting me that</i>

08:29.343 --> 08:30.275
<i>Sammie was dead.</i>

08:30.277 --> 08:34.212
<i>It was from @marissacampaign.</i>

08:34.214 --> 08:35.847
<i>Then sammie resurfaced saying</i>

08:35.849 --> 08:36.515
<i>She was fine.</i>

08:36.517 --> 08:37.349
<i>She just fainted and went to</i>

08:37.351 --> 08:38.482
<i>The hospital or something.</i>

08:38.485 --> 08:40.150
<i>Then I saw this.</i>

08:40.153 --> 08:42.320
<i>Turns out, @marissacampaign was</i>

08:42.322 --> 08:44.489
<i>The account that was reese</i>

08:44.491 --> 08:45.724
<i>Before her name became</i>

08:45.726 --> 08:46.992
<i>@tntsheart.</i>

08:46.994 --> 08:48.460
<i>>> wait, I'm--wait, hold on.</i>

08:48.462 --> 08:50.128
<i>So @marissacampaign is--you--</i>

08:50.130 --> 08:51.730
<i>>> yeah, became reese</i>

08:51.732 --> 08:54.299
<i>@tntsheart.</i>

08:54.301 --> 08:55.567
<i>The next morning, I went to</i>

08:55.569 --> 08:56.234
<i>Reese's account.</i>

08:56.236 --> 09:00.105
<i>It said, "user doesn't exist."</i>

09:00.107 --> 09:00.772
<i>I was like, "oh, no."</i>

09:00.774 --> 09:02.374
<i>So I went to my d.M.S from</i>

09:02.376 --> 09:03.275
<i>Sammie.</i>

09:03.277 --> 09:04.809
<i>I started trying to find things</i>

09:04.811 --> 09:06.044
<i>That she had done and</i>

09:06.046 --> 09:07.045
<i>Screenshot them.</i>

09:07.047 --> 09:08.580
<i>Things were disappearing as I</i>

09:08.582 --> 09:09.447
<i>Had them up.</i>

09:09.449 --> 09:11.049
<i>They would blink out.</i>

09:11.051 --> 09:11.716
<i>Like, she was deleting</i>

09:11.718 --> 09:12.484
<i>Everything.</i>

09:12.486 --> 09:13.952
<i>She deleted all her own tweets</i>

09:13.954 --> 09:14.853
<i>About reese.</i>

09:14.855 --> 09:16.321
<i>She did that quickly because</i>

09:16.323 --> 09:17.822
<i>She got tipped off.</i>

09:17.824 --> 09:18.924
<i>The last thing I ever said to</i>

09:18.926 --> 09:20.926
<i>Her was, "just twitpic it."</i>

09:20.928 --> 09:21.893
<i>>> wow.</i>

09:21.895 --> 09:23.962
<i>What is your goal or hope that</i>

20:14.981 --> 20:15.947
>> she can express herself

20:15.949 --> 20:16.847
Pretty well.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.115
I mean, she's good at it.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.784
But, like, she said she loves

20:19.786 --> 20:21.986
Hard, and she doesn't let go.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.688
>> of course, that's what my big

20:23.690 --> 20:24.355
Fear was.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.090
>> right.

20:26.092 --> 20:26.958
>> so then we found her

20:26.960 --> 20:27.725
Facebook page.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.860
We went through her photos.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.729
She's got a kid.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.630
>> wow.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.098
>> when we go to her about page.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.867
Bam, websites and a twitter

20:36.869 --> 20:38.936
Page.

20:38.938 --> 20:42.740
>> "twisted_lizbian."

20:42.742 --> 20:45.176
>> it's a liz [bleep]

20:45.178 --> 20:47.578
Fan page.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.447
So it looks like she's sort of

20:49.449 --> 20:51.782
Moved on to this girl.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.484
>> I wonder if she follows me.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.585
>> it wouldn't shock me if she

20:54.587 --> 20:55.253
Does.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.254
Let's go to her page and see

20:56.256 --> 20:58.322
Who she follows.

20:58.324 --> 21:04.061
Oh, boy.

21:04.063 --> 21:04.729
There it is.

21:04.731 --> 21:08.032
>> she does follow you.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.301
She's been watching you.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.470
>> probably tweeted at you.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.138
>> she probably has, and knowing

21:14.140 --> 21:15.406
Me, I probably responded.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.474
>> the really scary thing is

21:16.476 --> 21:18.776
That this girl, who knows how

21:18.778 --> 21:20.244
Much she hurt you and how upset

21:20.246 --> 21:22.913
You were, has deliberately gone

21:22.915 --> 21:25.082
Out of her way to trick you into

21:25.084 --> 21:27.418
Continuing to be in touch with

21:27.420 --> 21:30.855
Her and hasn't stopped.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.123
>> it's frightening because,

21:32.125 --> 21:33.224
Like, what is this person

21:33.226 --> 21:34.191
Capable of?

21:34.193 --> 21:35.226
That's one place where I have

21:35.228 --> 21:37.295
Pause on even moving forward.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.163
We're dealing with someone who

21:39.165 --> 21:42.533
Is, you know, obsessed, and--and

21:42.535 --> 21:44.935
Therefore, may be perhaps

21:44.937 --> 21:47.004
Dangerous.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.073
>> so what do you want to do?

21:49.075 --> 21:51.876
>> I feel like I kind of

21:51.878 --> 21:54.679
Probably need to get it out.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.914
That make sense?

21:56.916 --> 21:57.615
>> so we're going?

21:57.617 --> 21:59.450
>> so I think we should go.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.752
So I say we send her a facebook

22:01.754 --> 22:02.553
Message.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.321
>> yes.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.188
>> cool?

22:04.190 --> 22:04.855
>> yeah.

22:04.857 --> 22:05.523
>> okay.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.223
"hey, sammie.

22:06.225 --> 22:07.992

Episode now and would love to

22:10.096 --> 22:10.761
Talk to you.

22:10.763 --> 22:11.562
We've spent the last few days

22:11.564 --> 22:12.730
With tracie thoms.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.098
Tracie had a lot of questions.

22:14.100 --> 22:14.932
We just want to hear your side

22:14.934 --> 22:15.766
Of the story.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.469
Please give me a call, a.S.A.P."

22:18.471 --> 22:19.670
I have a feeling she'll probably

22:19.672 --> 22:22.840
See that soon and be curious.

22:22.842 --> 22:23.507
>> okay.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.275
>> as soon as I hear from her,

22:24.277 --> 22:25.042
I'll let you guys know.

22:25.044 --> 22:25.976
Let's just be ready, in case

22:25.978 --> 22:27.111
Sh--I speak to her, and she

22:27.113 --> 22:28.813
Agrees, so we can get on a plane

22:28.815 --> 22:29.980
Tomorrow morning.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.449
>> okay.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.517
God, I'm a little worried.

22:33.519 --> 22:40.725
>> let's check facebook and see

22:40.727 --> 22:42.393
If we got anything.

22:42.395 --> 22:46.197
Messages.

22:46.199 --> 22:47.932
No.

22:47.934 --> 22:48.599

22:48.601 --> 22:50.568

22:50.570 --> 22:51.235

Oh, we do have a message.

22:51.904 --> 22:52.570

22:52.572 --> 22:54.538
We do have a message.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.431
<i>>> okay.</i>

29:27.433 --> 29:38.842
<i>>> so why don't you start</i>

29:38.844 --> 29:42.746
<i>With, who are you?</i>

29:42.748 --> 29:43.714
<i>>> sammie.</i>

29:43.716 --> 29:45.516
<i>I was born and raised here in</i>

29:45.518 --> 29:47.985
<i>This small town, in ardmore.</i>

29:47.987 --> 29:50.788
<i>And then I'm an only child, so I</i>

29:50.790 --> 29:52.189
<i>Was a loner in school.</i>

29:52.191 --> 29:54.725
<i>And so I got really involved in</i>

29:54.727 --> 29:55.959
<i>The internet.</i>

29:55.961 --> 29:57.227
<i>You know, I made a lot of, like,</i>

29:57.229 --> 29:59.196
<i>Internet friends and odd stuff.</i>

29:59.198 --> 30:01.732
<i>So it was pretty, pretty</i>

30:01.734 --> 30:04.101
<i>Comfortable online, whereas</i>

30:04.103 --> 30:06.537
<i>Opposed to real life.</i>

30:06.539 --> 30:09.573
<i>>> you've expressed from the</i>

30:09.575 --> 30:10.774
<i>Information that you've posted</i>

30:10.776 --> 30:12.676
<i>Online that your sexuality is</i>

30:12.678 --> 30:14.745
<i>Something that you're figuring</i>

30:14.747 --> 30:15.412
<i>Out.</i>

30:15.414 --> 30:16.180
<i>>> when I found out that I was</i>

30:16.182 --> 30:16.847
<i>Gay?</i>

30:16.849 --> 30:17.514
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:17.516 --> 30:18.182
<i>>> yeah.</i>

30:18.184 --> 30:18.916
<i>>> I've always known.</i>

30:18.918 --> 30:20.617
<i>And I kept that under wraps.</i>

30:20.619 --> 30:23.353
<i>That's why I got a boyfriend.</i>

30:23.355 --> 30:25.155
<i>I'm just happy that after my</i>

30:25.157 --> 30:26.857
<i>Son was born that I could end</i>

30:26.859 --> 30:28.492
<i>It 'cause I was just not happy</i>

30:28.494 --> 30:29.626
<i>At all.</i>

30:29.628 --> 30:31.762
<i>>> so when did you discover</i>

30:31.764 --> 30:33.130
<i>Marissa?</i>

30:33.132 --> 30:34.431
<i>>> when she got voted off</i>

30:34.433 --> 30:36.433
<i>The glee project,</i> I decided to

30:36.435 --> 30:38.168
Start @marissacampaign, you

30:38.170 --> 30:39.803
Know, like, let's get her on

30:39.805 --> 30:40.571
<i>Glee.</i>

30:40.573 --> 30:41.572
<i>>> then at some point, your</i>

30:41.574 --> 30:44.107
<i>Attention starts to shift.</i>

30:44.109 --> 30:45.242
<i>>> I was more of a tracie fan</i>

30:45.244 --> 30:46.877
<i>Then than, you know, anybody</i>

30:46.879 --> 30:47.878
<i>Else.</i>

30:47.880 --> 30:50.247
<i>>> was there any attraction?</i>

30:50.249 --> 30:51.849
<i>>> not in a weird way.</i>

30:51.851 --> 30:53.550
<i>Any interaction on twitter from</i>

30:53.552 --> 30:54.585
<i>Your favorite celebrity is,</i>

30:54.587 --> 30:56.954
<i>Like, the best thing ever.</i>

30:56.956 --> 30:58.222
<i>Makes you feel special, in a</i>

30:58.224 --> 30:59.623
<i>Way.</i>

30:59.625 --> 31:01.825
<i>That's when the idea popped in</i>

31:01.827 --> 31:03.093
<i>My head.</i>

31:03.095 --> 31:04.862
<i>>> what idea?</i>

31:04.864 --> 31:08.165
<i>>> to create another person</i>

31:08.167 --> 31:09.566
<i>Under that account.</i>

31:09.568 --> 31:12.936
<i>I just thought that if I did</i>

31:12.938 --> 31:14.304
<i>That, I would just get double</i>

31:14.306 --> 31:17.608
<i>Interactions.</i>

31:17.610 --> 31:19.209
<i>But killing off reese was</i>

31:19.211 --> 31:22.546
<i>Already going to be, like, the</i>

31:22.548 --> 31:24.615
<i>Actual ending.</i>

31:24.617 --> 31:30.354
<i>>> but that's a pretty extreme</i>

31:30.356 --> 31:32.222
<i>Attention grabber to--to say</i>

31:32.224 --> 31:36.927
<i>That someone is dead.</i>

31:36.929 --> 31:39.529
<i>Was there any sense in your head</i>

31:39.531 --> 31:42.232
<i>That, like, this was wrong?</i>

31:42.234 --> 31:43.400
<i>>> that--that didn't pop in my</i>

31:43.402 --> 31:44.434
<i>Head.</i>

31:44.436 --> 31:46.303
<i>>> what about just feeling bad?</i>

31:46.305 --> 31:47.905
<i>>> I felt really, really bad</i>

31:47.907 --> 31:48.805
<i>After.</i>

31:48.807 --> 31:49.473
<i>>> after what?</i>

31:49.475 --> 31:50.140
<i>>> after you got caught?</i>

31:50.142 --> 31:52.442
<i>>> after I got caught.</i>

31:52.444 --> 31:55.045
<i>>> this thing that you created</i>

31:55.047 --> 31:59.416
<i>Was extremely upsetting,</i>

31:59.418 --> 32:01.218
<i>Painful.</i>

32:01.220 --> 32:03.287
<i>All the energy I gave you,</i>

32:03.289 --> 32:04.421
<i>It just wasn't enough for you.</i>

32:04.423 --> 32:05.756
<i>Like, nothing--what was gonna be</i>

32:05.758 --> 32:06.556
<i>Enough?</i>

32:06.558 --> 32:07.724
<i>If we kept talking to you,</i>

32:07.726 --> 32:09.760
<i>We would still to this day be</i>

32:09.762 --> 32:10.727
<i>Referring to your dead friend,</i>

32:10.729 --> 32:12.296
<i>Reese.</i>

32:12.298 --> 32:14.698
<i>Like, forever.</i>

32:14.700 --> 32:15.399
<i>>> yeah.</i>

32:15.401 --> 32:16.199
<i>>> you'd have kept that going</i>

32:16.201 --> 32:18.735
<i>Forever.</i>

32:18.737 --> 32:21.672
<i>>> probably, yeah.</i>

32:21.674 --> 32:22.839
<i>>> the weird thing is that you</i>

32:22.841 --> 32:26.944
<i>Even got some genuine earned</i>

32:26.946 --> 32:29.513
<i>Attention from your efforts to</i>

32:29.515 --> 32:31.148
<i>Sort of help tracie.</i>

32:31.150 --> 32:32.816
<i>You got their attention in many</i>

32:32.818 --> 32:34.351
<i>Ways because of the person that</i>

32:34.353 --> 32:35.352
<i>You are, and--and your</i>

32:35.354 --> 32:36.320
<i>Creativity.</i>

32:36.322 --> 32:37.554
<i>It comes down to sort of just</i>

32:37.556 --> 32:39.289
<i>How you value yourself, your</i>

32:39.291 --> 32:41.758
<i>Self-worth.</i>

32:41.760 --> 32:43.093
<i>>> that makes sense.</i>

32:43.095 --> 32:44.194
<i>>> once you had a chance to</i>

32:44.196 --> 32:46.096
<i>Think about it, even just a</i>

32:46.098 --> 32:47.831
<i>Little bit tonight, tomorrow we</i>

32:47.833 --> 32:51.635
<i>Can maybe pick back up and try</i>

32:51.637 --> 32:55.172
<i>To make some steps forward.</i>

32:55.174 --> 32:57.240
<i>Okay.</i>

32:57.242 --> 33:02.179
<i>Goodnight.</i>

33:02.181 --> 33:04.247
<i>>> bye.</i>

33:04.249 --> 33:11.722
<i>>> that was weird.</i>

33:11.724 --> 33:14.024
<i>I think she was so guarded.</i>

33:14.026 --> 33:15.425
<i>>> she seems pretty</i>

33:15.427 --> 33:17.094
<i>Out of touch.</i>

33:17.096 --> 33:19.629
<i>I think that she specifically</i>

33:19.631 --> 33:22.299
<i>Doesn't really get when she's</i>

33:22.301 --> 33:23.166
<i>Doing these things that she's</i>

33:23.168 --> 33:24.167
<i>Doing something wrong until</i>

33:24.169 --> 33:25.035
<i>She's told that they're wrong.</i>

33:25.037 --> 33:25.802
<i>>> till she's told they're</i>

33:25.804 --> 33:26.470
<i>Wrong.</i>

33:26.472 --> 33:27.237
<i>It's weird, right?</i>

33:27.239 --> 33:27.971
<i>>> both: Yeah.</i>

33:27.973 --> 33:29.039
<i>>> totally weird.</i>

33:29.041 --> 33:30.407
<i>>> we can help this girl change</i>

33:30.409 --> 33:31.608
<i>Her life tomorrow.</i>

33:31.610 --> 33:33.410
<i>And you, of all people, have the</i>

33:33.412 --> 33:34.878
<i>Key.</i>

33:34.880 --> 33:36.947
<i>>> I hope so.</i>

33:36.949 --> 33:44.354
<i>>> this episode of</i> <i>catfish: The</i>

33:44.356 --> 33:47.257
<i>Tv show</i> continues now.

33:47.259 --> 33:51.428
>> oh, boy.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.195
>> what, you got something?

33:52.197 --> 33:53.230
>> lots of texts.

33:53.232 --> 33:53.897
>> really?

33:53.899 --> 33:54.564
>> yeah.

33:54.566 --> 33:55.232
>> from who?

33:55.234 --> 33:55.966
>> from sammie.

33:55.968 --> 33:57.234
"I'm sorry that I wasn't much

33:57.236 --> 33:57.901
Help.

33:57.903 --> 33:59.336
I just didn't know how to react.

33:59.338 --> 34:00.537
My emotions really have gotten

34:00.539 --> 34:01.304
The best of me.

34:01.306 --> 34:02.739
I'm seriously sitting down and

34:02.741 --> 34:03.640
Taking everything in.

34:03.642 --> 34:06.009
Will you come to my house?"

34:06.011 --> 34:10.547
>> I wonder what conclusion she

34:10.549 --> 34:13.417
Came to.

34:13.418 --> 34:16.152
I just want to listen.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.221
Today I want to listen.

34:18.223 --> 34:22.726
>> we're supposed to go in over

34:22.728 --> 34:26.463
Here.

34:26.465 --> 34:27.164
>> hi.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.231
>> hi.

34:28.233 --> 34:28.899
>> okay.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.301
>> thanks for having us over.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.235
>> sure.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.404
>> yeah.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.907
>> so we left yesterday on a

34:36.909 --> 34:38.875
Pretty strange note.

34:38.877 --> 34:42.012
Did you think about maybe why

34:42.014 --> 34:43.447
You chose to create reese and

34:43.449 --> 34:45.581
Kill her off and go through

34:45.583 --> 34:47.217
That whole charade?

34:47.219 --> 34:49.485
>> I did try to think about why.

34:49.487 --> 34:53.824
But I think what popped in my

34:53.826 --> 34:58.261
Head more was why I chose you.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.796
Because of the attention that I

34:59.798 --> 35:01.331
Was getting from you, I saw you

35:01.333 --> 35:02.132
More like a big sister.

35:02.134 --> 35:02.799
>> mm-hmm.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.901
>> and I don't have a sister,

35:04.903 --> 35:05.702
I don't have a brother, stuff

35:05.704 --> 35:06.570
Like that.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.438
And because my friends in the

35:08.440 --> 35:09.706
Real world weren't really

35:09.708 --> 35:12.142
Supportive of me, and, like, the

35:12.144 --> 35:13.510
Things I enjoy in my life.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.277
>> mm-hmm.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.313
>> so I guess creating reese,

35:16.315 --> 35:20.016
Somebody that could "fangirl"

35:20.018 --> 35:22.486
With me and all that stuff.

35:22.488 --> 35:23.286
>> uh-huh.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.188
>> and I think that's the point

35:25.190 --> 35:26.823
Where I went overboard.

35:26.825 --> 35:31.061
And I got attached

35:31.063 --> 35:34.731
To that caring and sympathy.

35:34.733 --> 35:35.866
>> because you didn't have it in

35:35.868 --> 35:37.634
Your life?

35:37.636 --> 35:39.703
>> yeah.

35:39.705 --> 35:43.406
>> it's a interesting thought

35:43.408 --> 35:44.908
That I hadn't thought of before.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.343
You created this relationship

35:46.345 --> 35:47.711
Online with a best friend for

35:47.713 --> 35:48.678
Yourself because that was

35:48.680 --> 35:49.880
Something you were craving.

35:49.882 --> 35:50.680
And that is something that I

35:50.682 --> 35:53.216
Never considered.

35:53.218 --> 35:54.151
>> historically, have you been

35:54.153 --> 35:56.052
Able to go to your parents with

35:56.054 --> 35:57.787
Your problems?

35:57.789 --> 35:58.522
>> no.

35:58.524 --> 35:59.523
I never did.

35:59.525 --> 36:00.857
Just 'cause I--they wouldn't

36:00.859 --> 36:02.526
Understand.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.427
>> and there's a reason why all

36:04.429 --> 36:05.962
These people that you admire

36:05.964 --> 36:08.465
Online respond to you.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.467
Because of you.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.235
We identified with you.

36:12.237 --> 36:13.470
We liked you.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.938
You were enough.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.506
Like, you are enough.

36:16.508 --> 36:20.343
You're always gonna be enough.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.645
You're talented.

36:21.647 --> 36:24.047
You have a mind that's lovely

36:24.049 --> 36:26.550
And amazing.

36:26.552 --> 36:27.717
>> thank you.

36:27.719 --> 36:28.552
>> and if you take all of that

36:28.554 --> 36:30.620
Energy, write something, shoot

36:30.622 --> 36:32.422
It, cut it, make something, and

36:32.424 --> 36:33.590
Then you'll get attention for

36:33.592 --> 36:36.026
Your talent and your ability.

36:36.028 --> 36:36.960
>> I don't think that that's

36:36.962 --> 36:39.029
News to you 'cause you were

36:39.031 --> 36:41.131
Earning people's respect and

36:41.133 --> 36:43.500
Love by doing a good job for

36:43.502 --> 36:44.434
Them.

36:44.436 --> 36:45.869
And you're clearly a writer.

36:45.871 --> 36:46.536
>> right.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.304
>> like, someone who writes

36:47.306 --> 36:49.806
Without assignment, just

36:49.808 --> 36:51.675
Automatically, because they need

36:51.677 --> 36:52.676
To.

36:52.678 --> 36:53.376
>> I also think there's

36:53.378 --> 36:54.277
Something really interesting

36:54.279 --> 36:57.814
About you and your story and

36:57.816 --> 37:00.817
Growing up with deaf parents

37:00.819 --> 37:03.453
And being gay and having a

37:03.455 --> 37:05.922
Boyfriend and a child, and--I

37:05.924 --> 37:07.824
Mean, that's really interesting

37:07.826 --> 37:11.361
And certainly a good start for a

37:11.363 --> 37:13.563
Story about someone a lot like

37:13.565 --> 37:15.398
You.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.133
>> I like that.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.034
Like, one day, I can probably,

37:18.036 --> 37:21.037
Like, put my creativity and my

37:21.039 --> 37:22.205
Feelings into one thing and

37:22.207 --> 37:24.975
Create something.

37:24.977 --> 37:27.544
I never would've identified my

37:27.546 --> 37:28.912
Feelings in the way that you

37:28.914 --> 37:30.547
Guys did for me.

37:30.549 --> 37:31.615
I see the way you're putting it.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.617
Like, it's definitely, like, a

37:33.619 --> 37:36.319
Wakeup, kind of expanding my

37:36.321 --> 37:38.088
Mind kind of thing.

37:38.090 --> 37:39.823
And I'm gonna take that with me

Forever.

37:41.893 --> 37:48.465
It's really brutal what I did.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.467
I do know the effect that I had

37:50.469 --> 37:52.569
On you guys, and I really am

37:52.571 --> 37:54.104
Truly am sorry.

I'm glad I actually got to

>> how do you feel about the

39:19.191 --> 39:20.490
Whole thing?

39:20.492 --> 39:22.459
>> I think the biggest learning

39:22.461 --> 39:24.527
Moment from that whole thing was

39:24.529 --> 39:25.895
Probably on her end.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.163
She really is such a talented

39:27.165 --> 39:29.766
Girl and such a creative being,

39:29.768 --> 39:31.701
And I-I just really hope that--

39:31.703 --> 39:33.069
That, you know, she can go

39:33.071 --> 39:35.238
Forward, and--and I'll be buying

39:35.240 --> 39:36.272
Her books one day.

39:36.274 --> 39:37.474
>> awesome, tracie.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.075
It was good to talk to you.

39:39.077 --> 39:39.743

>> how you doing?

39:50.355 --> 39:51.488
>> pretty good.

39:51.490 --> 39:52.288
Pretty good.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.189

39:53.191 --> 39:54.224
Little baby boy?

39:54.226 --> 39:55.191
>> he's doing good.

39:55.193 --> 39:56.126
The weather's nice, so we're,

39:56.128 --> 39:57.360
Like, going out every single

39:57.362 --> 39:58.228
Day.

39:58.230 --> 39:59.095
So it's fun.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.464
>> have you been active at all

40:01.466 --> 40:04.200
In any accounts with tracie or

40:04.202 --> 40:05.268
Lotti?

40:05.270 --> 40:07.170
>> no.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.005
Not following lotti or tracie.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.340
>> how do you feel about the

40:10.342 --> 40:11.007
Whole thing?

40:11.009 --> 40:11.975
I mean, that was a pretty

40:11.977 --> 40:14.110
Intense couple days.

40:14.112 --> 40:17.180
>> it was a very good learning

40:17.182 --> 40:17.847
Experience.

40:17.849 --> 40:18.548
I mean, it taught me about

40:18.550 --> 40:19.215
Myself.

40:19.217 --> 40:20.517
>> I feel like we're seeing a

40:20.519 --> 40:21.785
Different side of you right now

40:21.787 --> 40:23.520
Than we saw when we were at your

40:23.522 --> 40:24.687
House.

40:24.689 --> 40:25.922
>> yeah, I've been writing,

40:25.924 --> 40:26.990
Like, a lot, so--

40:26.992 --> 40:27.824
>> great, what kind of--what

40:27.826 --> 40:28.525
Kind of writing?

40:28.527 --> 40:30.560
>> kind of like a drama-comedy

40:30.562 --> 40:31.494
Kind of thing.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.196
'cause I have so many ideas.

40:33.198 --> 40:34.464
>> we're excited to hear things

40:34.466 --> 40:35.598
Are going well, so hopefully

40:35.600 --> 40:36.766
We'll see you soon.

40:36.768 --> 40:37.801
>> okay.

40:37.803 --> 40:39.002
I will see you guys later.

40:39.004 --> 40:39.669
>> all right.

40:39.671 --> 40:40.336

40:41.006 --> 40:42.639

40:42.641 --> 40:46.009
>> hey, it's john.

40:46.011 --> 40:46.776
>> look at this guy.

40:46.778 --> 40:47.744
>> he fell in love with her

40:47.746 --> 40:49.045
Voice, and he only got to hear

40:49.047 --> 40:49.779
It once.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.147
>> would you be heartbroken if

40:51.149 --> 40:52.248
This didn't work out?

40:52.250 --> 40:53.450
>> I think I would.

40:53.452 --> 40:54.884
>> where are the faroe islands?

40:54.886 --> 40:56.786
>> are you kidding me?

40:56.788 --> 40:57.687
>> did we get it wrong?

40:57.689 --> 40:59.756
>> this is the right spot.

40:59.758 --> 41:00.657
Is she looking through the fence

41:00.659 --> 41:01.324
Or something?

41:01.326 --> 41:02.025
>> feeling anything now?

41:02.027 --> 41:03.793
>> oh, I'm feeling a lot.
