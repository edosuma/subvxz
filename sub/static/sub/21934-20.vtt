WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:05.744
TOBY: This memo
is an insult!

00:05.788 --> 00:07.398
You've been offered equity

00:07.442 --> 00:09.879
in a company
with great upside potential.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.185
So how is that an insult?

00:11.228 --> 00:14.057
I invented a winch, State
of New Mexico orders

00:14.101 --> 00:16.451
15 grand worth of it,
you take the money.

00:16.494 --> 00:17.669
[laughing]:
Okay.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.280
All right, well, let's see.

00:19.323 --> 00:21.369
I start a company
with my own savings,

00:21.412 --> 00:23.936
I pluck you guys out of
obscurity, I give you jobs,

00:23.980 --> 00:26.591
and then, you throw
my generosity

00:26.635 --> 00:27.766
in my face.

00:27.810 --> 00:28.854
Generosity?

00:28.898 --> 00:30.378
Well, let's look
at these numbers,

00:30.421 --> 00:31.466
shall we?

00:31.509 --> 00:32.293
You scanned my memo?

00:32.336 --> 00:33.511
Oh, I scanned it, baby.

00:33.555 --> 00:37.080
And Happy and I
really appreciate

00:37.124 --> 00:39.778
the .75% share of her invention.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.911
Corporations routinely
take the lion's share

00:41.954 --> 00:43.434
of an employee's invention.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.610
And you two are married,
so you're really getting 1.5%.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.177
SYLVESTER:
How do you explain

00:47.221 --> 00:48.483
my .7%?

00:48.526 --> 00:49.527
How do I rate less
than these guys?

00:49.571 --> 00:51.181
Simple, you're a
human calculator.

00:51.225 --> 00:54.097
Artificial intelligence makes
you superfluous in seven years.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.403
[gasps]
But I still

00:55.446 --> 00:57.579
gave you a piece of the pie.
Is that not nice?

00:57.622 --> 00:58.797
What about Paige?

00:58.841 --> 01:00.060
Interesting that she has
a full one percent;

01:00.103 --> 01:01.104
more than all of us.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.150
She's not even a genius.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.194
Hmm, so strange.How peculiar.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.978
What are you guys insinuating?

01:06.022 --> 01:08.111
Nothing. Just that the only
person in the office

01:08.155 --> 01:10.679
to play Nude Olympics with
Walter goes home with the gold.

01:10.722 --> 01:12.681
Before I came along, you dorks

01:12.724 --> 01:14.596
were setting up
home office computers.

01:14.639 --> 01:17.033
Yeah, and for what it's worth,
Paige's share is really .25%.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.730
Ralph gets .75%

01:18.774 --> 01:20.515
for all the times
he helped us out.

01:20.558 --> 01:23.344
But due to labor laws, I had
to put it under Paige's name.

01:23.387 --> 01:24.997
Hold on.

01:25.041 --> 01:28.784
You... you value my son three
times more than you value me?

01:28.827 --> 01:30.742
Well, only on
a work contribution level.

01:30.786 --> 01:33.528
Dingus, our fertility treatment
hasn't worked.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.920
We need more funds.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.618
It's not like
I'm keeping the funds!

01:36.661 --> 01:38.446
I'm reinvesting it in Scorpion.

01:38.489 --> 01:40.317
I-Isn't more tomorrow

01:40.361 --> 01:41.536
better than a little today?

01:41.579 --> 01:43.364
Nope.Oh, fine!

01:43.407 --> 01:45.148
Suppose I can give you
a few extra bucks,

01:45.192 --> 01:46.758
seeing as it's your invention.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.543
Wow, thanks
for the extra shillings

01:48.586 --> 01:50.022
to throw into my account.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.198
Your account?

01:51.241 --> 01:52.938
What do you got,
a separate bank account?

01:52.982 --> 01:54.505
Maybe.

01:54.549 --> 01:57.334
[sighs] What is Easter Island's
point of view on all this?

01:57.378 --> 01:58.640
I'm just trying to figure out

01:58.683 --> 02:00.642
where I can buy just
one right shoe...

02:00.685 --> 02:01.860
Wait for it, this
is gonna be good.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.079
...because I'm gonna lose mine

02:03.123 --> 02:04.428
somewhere up Walter's ass.

02:04.472 --> 02:05.516
Bam! There it is.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.604
Wait, why are you mad at me?

02:06.648 --> 02:08.563
I don't see my name
on that list.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.521
You work for Homeland,
you're not a Scorpion employee.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.175
So I'm not a real part
of the team?

02:12.219 --> 02:14.351
I risk my life
just like everybody else.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.179
More so, 'cause he is so old.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.573
Troublemaker.Penny-pincher.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.923
You should've known what
problems this memo would cause.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.491
[sighs] We need guidance
getting through this conflict.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.449
And I know exactly who to call.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.930
Walter, if you're calling who
I think you're calling, don't.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.540
He's helped us before.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.455
His diploma came with a maze
and a word search on the back.

02:31.499 --> 02:34.328
Yes, hello,
this is Walter O'Brien.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.460
Uh, not good,
actually.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.810
And we need your counseling
right away; money is no object.

02:39.855 --> 02:40.725
Okay, see you soon.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.205
Okay, see you soon.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.467
That's Homeland Director Carson.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.077
He's gonna be here
in five minutes.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.601
Carson? What does
that turd want?

02:46.644 --> 02:48.385
CARSON:
Four-person CIA team imbedded

02:48.429 --> 02:49.952
in Kazakhstan.

02:49.995 --> 02:52.476
Found out they were
kidnapped just hours ago.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.652
Okay, if Homeland can give us
their satellite imagery,

02:54.696 --> 02:56.524
we can provide
an extraction plan

02:56.567 --> 02:57.612
for the military.

02:57.655 --> 02:59.222
Extraction? No.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.093
We got six of their guys, we're
gonna do a swap next week.

03:01.137 --> 03:03.270
This stuff goes down
all the time.

03:03.313 --> 03:04.662
Then why are you here?

03:04.706 --> 03:06.621
Those agents are
the starting infield

03:06.664 --> 03:08.231
for the CIA softball team,

03:08.275 --> 03:11.365
and we were supposed to play
for the FGSL championship today.

03:11.408 --> 03:12.409
FGSL?

03:12.453 --> 03:14.672
Federal Government
Softball League.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.196
Replacement team
would be the FBI,

03:16.239 --> 03:18.198
but they're busting
a drug ring in Colorado;

03:18.241 --> 03:19.373
ATF's intercepting

03:19.416 --> 03:22.202
a firearms shipment
in the Gulf.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.768
Oh, even the Department
of Agriculture's dealing

03:23.812 --> 03:27.511
with a boll weevil problem
in Texas, so it's down to you.

03:27.555 --> 03:28.904
Down to us for what?

03:28.947 --> 03:31.254
As independent contractors
with federal clearance,

03:31.298 --> 03:34.214
Scorpion qualifies
to play in the league.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.519
Right here in
the rule book.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.738
I refuse

03:36.781 --> 03:38.696
to allow Homeland's
undefeated season

03:38.740 --> 03:41.090
to be tarnished
with an asterisk.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.831
I won't accept
a forfeit.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.485
So you're going to play us.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.269
And why should we help you?
You tried to put

03:46.313 --> 03:48.271
my roomie in prison.You two were roommates?

03:48.315 --> 03:50.839
Yeah, while him and I
were engaged.While she was married to him.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.754
Before I dated her.

03:52.797 --> 03:53.972
Damn freak show in here.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.844
Look, you're gonna play,

03:55.887 --> 03:58.455
'cause if you don't, let's just
say Scorpion might not get

03:58.499 --> 04:00.544
any government jobs
coming its way.

04:00.588 --> 04:05.201
If you're trying to get back
at me by humiliating these guys,

04:05.245 --> 04:08.509
perhaps you and I should figure
out another way to settle this.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.815
Threatening a superior?

04:10.859 --> 04:13.470
I'd hate to have
to bring you up on charges.

04:13.514 --> 04:14.863
Again.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.604
I-I don't expect
you to play, Pops.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.040
But come, support your team.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.824
You could be...

04:19.868 --> 04:21.522
the mascot.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.132
Let's make it interesting.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.656
If we win, Homeland doubles
the rate that they pay Scorpion.

04:25.700 --> 04:30.313
Fine. But if we win, I'm yanking
Scorpion's government clearance.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.663
I am sick of
your antics,

04:32.707 --> 04:35.753
comments, and
unprofessionalism.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.320
Um, Cabe, I do the books.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.757
We lose government work,
Scorpion's toast.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.193
What's the matter?

04:41.237 --> 04:42.586
Mommy won't let you
play ball today?

04:42.630 --> 04:45.197
Shake it.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.549
See you at the field
in Sherman Oaks

04:48.592 --> 04:50.594
in 30 minutes.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.471
What the hell were you thinking?

04:57.514 --> 04:58.646
He called us out.

04:58.689 --> 05:01.649
[moaning]

05:01.692 --> 05:02.563
You bet our company.

05:02.606 --> 05:03.607
We can't beat them.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.566
You heard how
Carson talked to us.

05:05.609 --> 05:06.697
TOBY:
You see, geniuses,

05:06.741 --> 05:08.177
Paige and Cabe grew up
playing sports.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.527
They don't know what it's like
to be bullied by a jock.

05:10.571 --> 05:13.878
They don't know that you're just
supposed to take it and move on.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.619
We'll coach you guys up.

05:15.663 --> 05:17.621
People like us
don't win at sports.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.797
In gym,
Coach Baclavella

05:19.841 --> 05:21.146
would give grade bumps
to the kids

05:21.190 --> 05:23.192
who would give me
the worst wedgies.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.368
One year, everybody got A's.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.761
Little League sucks
for nerds growing up.

05:26.804 --> 05:27.979
You watch kids do things

05:28.023 --> 05:30.155
you can't,
having all the fun,

05:30.199 --> 05:31.635
and at the end
of the season,

05:31.679 --> 05:35.247
the winners get to go to a party
at Big Ernesto's Taco Hut,

05:35.291 --> 05:37.075
something you know you're
never gonna be able to do.

05:37.119 --> 05:40.078
And Ernesto would let all those
kids choose their trophies

05:40.122 --> 05:41.776
out of the trophy case.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.168
Stupid trophies.

05:43.212 --> 05:44.648
I always wanted
one of those trophies.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.389
We don't have any equipment,
or any funds to buy any,

05:46.433 --> 05:47.999
so, guess we can't play.

05:48.043 --> 05:50.393
I've got a fast and cheap way
to get everything that we need.

05:50.437 --> 05:51.568
Just meet meet me
at the field.

05:51.612 --> 05:54.354
No, I-I...
I can go with you.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.399
And-and help you carry things.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.879
Okay, I got here
as quick as I could.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.576
Let the healing begin.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.579
What I miss?

06:02.623 --> 06:04.668
Called me
on the right day, Gallo.

06:04.712 --> 06:08.629
We busted a frat house for
bookmaking-- civil forfeiture--

06:08.672 --> 06:11.588
seized everything, including
tons of sporting equipment.

06:11.632 --> 06:15.070
Now, I feel a cold coming on,

06:15.113 --> 06:19.727
so I'm just gonna...
put the key down here,

06:19.770 --> 06:20.815
and head home sick.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.077
Just make sure
everything's back

06:22.120 --> 06:24.253
by 6:00, before the next guy
clocks in, huh?

06:24.296 --> 06:25.733
Appreciate it, pal.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.299
Appreciate what?

06:27.343 --> 06:29.606
I never saw you.
[chuckles]

06:29.650 --> 06:33.131
So this is unsavory.

06:33.175 --> 06:37.832
Wouldn't be necessary if any of
you dorks had baseball gloves.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.834
FLORENCE: ♪ Way down South
in the cemetery ♪

06:39.877 --> 06:42.445
RALPH: ♪ Way down South
in the cemetery ♪

06:42.489 --> 06:45.056
♪ That's where your team
is gonna be buried ♪

06:45.100 --> 06:47.494
RALPH: ♪ That's where your team
is gonna be buried... ♪

06:47.537 --> 06:48.843
Yeah, that's right, Homeland!

06:48.886 --> 06:51.193
We're gonna roll
right over you little punks!

06:51.236 --> 06:53.456
I regret asking her to play.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.805
What did she do
to my son?

06:54.849 --> 06:56.198
Florence, you seem

06:56.241 --> 06:57.808
very motivated.

06:57.852 --> 07:00.115
Yeah, well, you remember I told
you that jocks used to throw

07:00.158 --> 07:02.770
the ball at the science
lab wall to bother me?

07:02.813 --> 07:05.381
I really hate jocks.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.296
Speaking of jocks, uh,
Ralph, in this bag

07:07.339 --> 07:08.645
is a protective cup
I bought.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.691
Go to the port-o-john
and put it on.

07:10.734 --> 07:11.822
Do I have to?

07:11.866 --> 07:13.476
I want grandchildren
someday. Go.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.304
Okay,

07:15.347 --> 07:16.479
positions.
Whoa.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.959
Who made you manager?

07:18.002 --> 07:19.090
Anyone who earned two varsity
letters in high school,

07:19.134 --> 07:20.265
raise your hand.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.486
That's what I thought.
Sly, you'll catch;

07:23.530 --> 07:25.706
Cecil, you're tall,
so center field;

07:25.749 --> 07:28.143
Happy's short, so she'll play
short; and Toby, first base.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.667
Are you sure Walter won't want
Toby and I to share a position,

07:30.711 --> 07:32.582
like he had us share
equity in Scorpion?

07:32.626 --> 07:34.279
You guys are the worst.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.281
This game is
the perfect opportunity

07:36.325 --> 07:40.024
for you to come together
as a "literal team,"

07:40.068 --> 07:42.592
in the midst
of falling apart completely.

07:42.636 --> 07:43.637
Get lost, quack.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.638
I'm gonna go stretch.

07:44.681 --> 07:45.943
RALPH:
Mom,

07:45.987 --> 07:47.510
I can't figure out
how to put this thing on!

07:47.554 --> 07:48.642
[banging on door]

07:48.685 --> 07:49.947
I'm never
having grandkids.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.601
CARSON:

Corrections surplus.

I have filmed every pitch

08:11.926 --> 08:14.450
and every at bat
of our undefeated season,

08:14.494 --> 08:17.192
but this game
is going to be my Citizen Kane.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.585
Now where's Gallo
and O'Brien?

08:18.628 --> 08:20.630
Tried them a little bit ago,
couldn't get through.

08:20.674 --> 08:21.805
But don't worry,
they'll show.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.807

Else, it's a forfeit.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.940
Then, bye-bye,

is keeping those jackasses.

gussied up.

Flo dressed up fancy, and you're
just telling me this right now?

by a thread as it is

this morning.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.167
You know, if Walt and Paige
implode, so does the team.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.778
We can't have that;
we are wholly unemployable.I didn't tell you

09:21.822 --> 09:24.215
because you hold onto a secret
like a wet bar of soap.

09:24.259 --> 09:26.043

09:26.087 --> 09:27.218

We got to get
to the bottom of this.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.616
I found a few more bats. How
you doing with those gloves?

09:33.660 --> 09:35.183
Yep, finished.All right, we're running late.

give it to me.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.898

on "paper view" TV?

09:54.942 --> 09:56.900

together sometimes,

09:56.944 --> 09:59.468

no equipment,

25:02.283 --> 25:05.373
See?If you're so worried about this,

25:05.416 --> 25:07.767
why are you not asking Walter
these questions?

25:07.810 --> 25:09.246
SYLVESTER: Hey, guys.
What questions?

25:09.290 --> 25:10.987
HAPPY: About what's going on
between her and Walt.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.598
Something's going on
between you and Walt?

25:12.641 --> 25:15.775
No! We went to a lecture and
then he lied to Paige about it,

25:15.818 --> 25:16.993
and I'm not sure why.

25:17.037 --> 25:19.692
All right, well,
most important thing

25:19.735 --> 25:21.563
is that you don't have
any feelings for Walter,

25:21.607 --> 25:23.130
so everything's okay.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.871
Not if Walter
has butterflies for her.

25:24.914 --> 25:26.394
Then all hell breaks loose.

25:26.437 --> 25:27.961
All hell's gonna
break loose if Sly

25:28.004 --> 25:29.266
doesn't get
in the on-deck circle.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.616
When did you get here?

25:30.659 --> 25:32.443
Been here awhile.
You should confront Walter.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.184
TOBY: Why's everybody
under the bleachers?

25:36.056 --> 25:38.537
Oh, cat's out of the bag, huh?

25:38.580 --> 25:41.148
PAIGE: Ooh, good swing, Dyfrost.
You're right on it.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.585
Guys, how 'bout some chatter?

25:43.629 --> 25:45.413
Where the hell is everyone?

25:45.456 --> 25:47.328
[grunts]

25:49.199 --> 25:51.158
You're gonna separate
your shoulder.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.029
Suddenly, you give
a crap about me?

25:53.073 --> 25:54.640
You're gonna get hurt.Get off me. Get off me!

25:54.683 --> 25:55.684
[key drops]

25:57.730 --> 26:00.515
You had the key the whole time?

26:00.559 --> 26:02.299
What the hell, Walter?

26:12.135 --> 26:15.530
You want to explain
this to me?

26:15.574 --> 26:16.923
WALTER:
Uh...

26:16.966 --> 26:19.099
I must've, uh, forgotten.

26:19.142 --> 26:21.623
Forgot? You're a genius.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.583
You don't forget.Didn't know it was there.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.759
Damn it, Walter,

26:26.802 --> 26:29.152
why the hell don't you want us
to go to this game?!

26:29.196 --> 26:32.634
'Cause I didn't want you
to see me play!

26:34.288 --> 26:38.074
I don't want you to see!

26:38.118 --> 26:41.556
Son, it's just a game.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.428
Oh, please, in the history
of fathers and sons,

26:44.472 --> 26:45.952
it's never just a game.

26:52.915 --> 26:56.789
My father never came
to a science fair.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.184
But one year
I signed up for soccer,

27:01.228 --> 27:03.143
and he got so excited.

27:03.186 --> 27:06.799
So I studied the rules,
I watched the pros on TV,

27:06.842 --> 27:08.278
but in my first game,

27:08.322 --> 27:11.455
an attacker came at me and, uh,
there was a collision

27:11.499 --> 27:15.242
so I got disoriented and, um,
I tried to clear the ball,

27:15.285 --> 27:18.637
and I kicked it
into my own goal.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.509
Then as I was

27:21.552 --> 27:24.338
running to the sideline, I-I...

27:24.381 --> 27:28.821
locked eyes with my father
just as the coach yelled at me.

27:28.864 --> 27:33.042
He said, "O'Brien, you play
for the green team."

27:33.086 --> 27:35.044
And, um...

27:38.352 --> 27:39.962
And Dad looked away.

27:45.185 --> 27:47.840
You were willing
to possibly lose Scorpion

27:47.883 --> 27:50.973
to save face in front of me?

27:51.017 --> 27:53.236
I embarrassed him.

27:57.371 --> 27:59.547
I'm not strong enough
to withstand

27:59.590 --> 28:03.072
embarrassing two fathers
in one lifetime.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.339
ANNOUNCER:
A nightmare sixth for Homeland

28:09.383 --> 28:12.995
as Scorpion had more runs
than Aunt Tilly's stockings.

28:13.039 --> 28:17.347
Closing the gap to 16-15,
the ball jumping off their bats.

28:17.391 --> 28:19.001
PAIGE: Toby's hot balls
have really caused some damage.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.524
Word choice.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.570
Wait, hold on. I'm serious,
you guys. We can win this.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.267
We hold them here,
then come back and score,

28:24.311 --> 28:25.747
which isn't an issue
for us anymore.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.183
CARSON: Hey, these balls
have been tampered with.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.924
You were saying?

28:28.968 --> 28:31.318
Right here.
It's got loose stitching.

28:31.361 --> 28:32.841
Yeah, that's
made in China.

28:32.885 --> 28:34.060
CATCHER: All their balls
are coming apart.

28:34.103 --> 28:36.932
[sniffs] And they smell
like pepperoni.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.326
They may or may not have been
in an oven at some point.

28:39.369 --> 28:40.588
Cheaters!

28:40.631 --> 28:42.546
Technically not.
I checked, repeatedly.

28:42.590 --> 28:43.939
Okay, moving forward.

28:43.983 --> 28:47.551
From now on, everyone's
using Homeland's balls.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.815
Understood?

28:49.858 --> 28:51.555
MAN: Come on, two
innings left. Let's go!

28:51.599 --> 28:53.993
Okay, so we can't hit
with steamy balls,

28:54.036 --> 28:55.646
so we're finished.I can get help.

28:55.690 --> 28:58.214
I'll be right back, but you'll
have to play with one man down.

28:58.258 --> 29:00.434
No, you won't.PAIGE: Took you long enough.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.566
Excuse me,
I have to go pitch now.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.568
I lost the key.
It's my fault.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.832
We're taking
the field now,

29:06.875 --> 29:07.963
but as soon as
the half-inning's over,

29:08.007 --> 29:08.877
you and Toby
are gonna have a talk.

29:08.921 --> 29:10.183
Okay.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.011
You don't need to
sit this out, son.

29:12.054 --> 29:14.013
Running from your fears
only exhausts you.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.449
You can sub for Dyjob.

29:15.492 --> 29:16.798
Actually, it's Dyfrost.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.017
Shut up.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.019
Scorpion's only down
one run without me.

29:20.062 --> 29:22.282
It would be illogical
to shake up the team chemistry

29:22.325 --> 29:24.458
at this point.

29:28.114 --> 29:29.289
Here you go.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.464
Thanks for supporting
our charity.

29:30.507 --> 29:32.466
Hey.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.555
How long you been a Dodgers fan?

29:34.598 --> 29:36.252
Uh, not a baseball fan.
A physics fan.

29:36.296 --> 29:38.777
Your home runs are perfect
parabolic manifestations

29:38.820 --> 29:40.387
of Newton's third law.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.171
Um, who should
I make this out to?

29:42.215 --> 29:43.782
I don't want your autograph.

29:43.825 --> 29:46.001
I saw online that you were here
today, and I came for help.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.307
I'm on a team
of geniuses

29:47.350 --> 29:48.569
and I need you to play
on our softball team.

29:48.612 --> 29:51.572
The outcome could
impact world safety.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.617
Security.

29:53.661 --> 29:56.011
Just wanted to talk to him!

29:59.972 --> 30:01.495
Okay, Kyle Dirk,

30:01.538 --> 30:05.716
let's find your limo driver's
number in your calendar.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.893
We want a hitter!

30:07.936 --> 30:09.895
Not a babysitter!

30:09.938 --> 30:12.723
We want a batter!
Not an old man's bladder!

30:12.767 --> 30:15.639
RINGTONE:
Attaboy. Attaboy.

30:15.683 --> 30:16.902
Hap, I'm a little
busy right now.

30:16.945 --> 30:18.381
Okay, I need you to use that

30:18.425 --> 30:19.556
manipulative shrink brain
of yours

30:19.600 --> 30:20.862
and call Kyle Dirk's
limo driver.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.212
Pretend to be his manager,

30:23.256 --> 30:25.432
and tell him to run down
the street to get Dirk

30:25.475 --> 30:28.000
a sandwich for the ride home.
And hurry.

30:28.043 --> 30:30.176
The event's winding down
and Dirk will be out any second.

30:30.219 --> 30:32.569
[bat clinks]Okay, but I'm a little concerned
'cause it sounds like

30:32.613 --> 30:34.833
you're gonna kidnap baseball
star Kyle Dirk.PAIGE: Toby! Toby! Toby!

30:34.876 --> 30:36.356
Toby!Paige, I'm a little
busy right now.

30:36.399 --> 30:39.141
I'll get right on it.

30:46.714 --> 30:48.542
[engine starts]

30:48.585 --> 30:50.109
Crap.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.201
Okay, let's hit it.

30:55.244 --> 30:58.334
ANNOUNCER: Bottom of the
seventh, Scorpion's down by one.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.075
Will they score?

31:00.119 --> 31:03.078
An ironic question considering,
from the look of the fellas,

31:03.122 --> 31:04.950
these guys spent
their high school years

31:04.993 --> 31:06.125
wondering if they'd ever score.

31:06.168 --> 31:09.041
That's it. I am kicking his ass.

31:13.088 --> 31:15.438
Okay, uh, Walt, uh,
it's time for our talk.

31:15.482 --> 31:17.179
Flo, you, too.

31:19.399 --> 31:21.183
Hey, I am tired
of you razzing my guys.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.098
You want to know
the one thing lamer

31:23.142 --> 31:25.361
than a bunch of nerds
playing sports?

31:25.405 --> 31:28.060
The guy who makes fun
of those nerds.

31:28.103 --> 31:30.714
And I'm not a nerd.
I'm a jock.

31:30.758 --> 31:33.630
One more word out of you,
and my foot and your gooty

31:33.674 --> 31:37.069
are gonna have an
unpleasant meeting. Got it?

31:37.112 --> 31:40.072
By "gooty," do you mean wiener?

31:41.725 --> 31:44.859
Then I got you
loud and clear, sister.

31:49.472 --> 31:52.649
That is one hell of a woman.

31:52.693 --> 31:54.477
[bat clinks]It was a white lie.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.001
Paige taught me
all about white lies.

31:56.044 --> 31:58.003
I did it because
I knew she'd feel bad

31:58.046 --> 32:00.266
that I overheard her
mocking the lecture.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.050
I told you, it was all benign.

32:02.094 --> 32:04.183
It's a white lie
if you brought me.

32:04.226 --> 32:05.924
Bringing a woman,
that's a tan lie.

32:05.967 --> 32:07.621
Bringing a woman
that you dreamt about,

32:07.664 --> 32:08.970
that's a brown lie.

32:09.014 --> 32:11.016
Bringing a woman that
you dreamt about kissing?

32:11.059 --> 32:13.192
That's a blacklie.Preposterous.

32:13.235 --> 32:15.324
If it's a white lie,
go tell her.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.196
Okay, maybe it was beige.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.719
But the important thing is,

32:18.762 --> 32:21.156
that I have no feelings
for Florence.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.246
Yes, that's the important thing,
that you guys have no

32:24.290 --> 32:26.031
romantic feelings for each other
whatsoever...

32:26.074 --> 32:28.163
for Scorpion's sake.

32:28.207 --> 32:29.948
PATTY: Great.
So, everything's settled?

32:29.991 --> 32:30.992
When did you get here?

32:31.036 --> 32:32.341
Been here awhile.
I'm up to speed.

32:32.385 --> 32:36.824
Hey... what the hell
are you guys doing?

32:36.867 --> 32:38.260
Get back in the dugout.

32:41.611 --> 32:44.875
Hey, what are we doing here?

32:46.181 --> 32:48.618
Oh, God!Relax. I've got
the doors locked,

32:48.662 --> 32:51.099
but I'm not a psycho. Here.

32:51.143 --> 32:52.927
Scroll the files.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.407
Baseball's a game
of statistics.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.409
Look at my team's numbers.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.063
We've stopped a tsunami, nukes,

32:58.106 --> 32:59.673
saved over seven billion people,

32:59.716 --> 33:01.283
and one puppy on a slow day.

33:01.327 --> 33:03.851
DIRK:
I saw this dog on the news.

33:03.894 --> 33:05.940
Had one just like it
when I was a kid.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.246
It's a long story,

33:07.289 --> 33:10.118
but we can't help people
and pups in the future

33:10.162 --> 33:12.599
if we lose this game.

33:12.642 --> 33:13.643
Please.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.123
[sighs]

33:15.167 --> 33:17.430
After a strikeout by a wizard,

33:17.473 --> 33:20.476
and a pop-up by
the enchanting Ms. Dineen,

33:20.520 --> 33:24.132
it all falls on the shoulders
of Inmate Number 58432--

33:24.176 --> 33:28.397
my future stepson Ralph.

33:28.441 --> 33:31.313
I know you're scared,
but I believe in you 100%.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.098
Guys, we got Kyle Dirk,
he's gonna give us one at bat.

33:33.141 --> 33:35.143
Ralph, go hit the bench.

33:35.187 --> 33:36.840
Whoa. I don't know
what the hell

33:36.884 --> 33:39.147
Kyle Dirk is doing here,
but he can't play.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.280
He's not a part
of Scorpion.Yes, he is.

33:41.323 --> 33:44.413
Read it and weep, chump.Let me see that.

33:44.457 --> 33:47.373
[sighs]
"One-day contract.

33:47.416 --> 33:50.854
Hired to get stuff
off of high shelves."

33:50.898 --> 33:53.422
I guess a contract's
a contract,

33:53.466 --> 33:56.338
so let's play ball and
end this madness already.

33:56.382 --> 33:59.167
One at bat.

34:00.516 --> 34:02.649
CARSON:
Ridiculous.

34:02.692 --> 34:05.434
You want technicalities?
All right.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.088
I'll give you technicalities.

34:07.132 --> 34:08.350
HAPPY: All right,
come on, Kyle, let's go.

34:08.394 --> 34:09.438
[all cheering]

34:15.314 --> 34:18.360
Hit batsman, take your base.[catcher chuckles]

34:18.404 --> 34:20.014
ANNOUNCER: Holy smoke![drops bat]

34:20.058 --> 34:21.798
Carson out-thunk the geniuses.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.235
Come on.CABE: Come on!

34:23.278 --> 34:25.933
Well, I kidnapped someone
for nothing.

34:29.328 --> 34:30.894
These people are nuts.

34:30.938 --> 34:33.810
HAPPY:
Hey, where are you going?

34:33.854 --> 34:36.857
Well, looks like
Kyle's going home.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.598
Guess it's up to me.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.295
So much on the line,

34:40.339 --> 34:42.471
and your nose is
buried in a book?

34:42.515 --> 34:44.517
Strange.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.259
It's... interesting.

34:47.302 --> 34:50.436
[chuckles]
I see.

34:50.479 --> 34:51.698
Ow, ow, ow!

34:51.741 --> 34:53.352
Ow, my leg, ow!

34:53.395 --> 34:54.744
That's your hamstring.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.224
See, I'm a real doctor.

34:56.268 --> 34:57.791
PAIGE: Ralph, go
pinch-run for Kyle.

Walter, you're the
last one on the bench.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.361
You'll have to hit.

35:08.932 --> 35:12.197
ANNOUNCER:
Team Scorpion's replaced
Kyle Dirk with an eighth grader.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.590
Not since the Red Sox
traded Babe Ruth

35:14.634 --> 35:17.637
for completion funds
for musical No, No, Nanette

35:17.680 --> 35:20.074
has there been
such a fiasco trade.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.294
Hey, you want me
to come back up there?

35:22.337 --> 35:23.643
Kinda.

35:23.686 --> 35:25.993
Cecil, may I have a moment?

35:26.036 --> 35:27.821
You got to put the tape on
and play.

35:27.864 --> 35:31.477
My leg is fine.
You need this, Walter,

35:31.520 --> 35:34.654
more than Cabe needs help with
you carrying sports equipment.

35:34.697 --> 35:37.135
When I found out that was your
reason for not being here,

35:37.178 --> 35:39.615
I surmised you were
ducking the fight.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.531
What was it that
traumatized you, huh?

35:42.575 --> 35:43.793
A dropped pop-up
in grade school?

35:43.837 --> 35:45.752
A ball between your
legs in Little League?

35:45.795 --> 35:48.146
[quietly]: I can't perform
sports in front of others.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.235
Especially Cabe.

35:50.278 --> 35:51.410
Childhood events
affecting us

35:51.453 --> 35:52.889
for the rest of
our lives is tragic.

35:52.933 --> 35:55.196
I'm not gonna let that
happen to you, Walter.

35:55.240 --> 35:59.026
The way to peace
is through the fire.

36:07.991 --> 36:09.079
Walter...

36:09.123 --> 36:11.691
I can see you're
going through something,

36:11.734 --> 36:14.215
but I have faith in you.

36:28.142 --> 36:29.709
[sighs]

36:29.752 --> 36:32.015
It's almost certain
I'll make an out.

36:32.059 --> 36:34.279
If you're going for a pep talk,
not the best way to start.

36:34.322 --> 36:35.932
And we'll lose our
government contract,

36:35.976 --> 36:37.673
be back where we were
four years ago,

36:37.717 --> 36:39.458
installing routers in diners.

36:39.501 --> 36:41.155
Not getting any better.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.854
I'm glad we're all
wearing the same shirts.

36:44.898 --> 36:47.770
It shows we're a team.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.511
And you all
pulled together

36:49.555 --> 36:52.253
as a team to get us
within one run.

36:52.297 --> 36:55.387
And that's to save Scorpion.

36:55.430 --> 36:58.781
We're all giving 100.75%.
Except for Sly.

36:58.825 --> 37:01.306
He's giving 100.70.

37:01.349 --> 37:04.222
I was wrong about the shares.
I'm sorry. I'll rectify it.

37:04.265 --> 37:07.877
Because... we're
Team Scorpion.

37:07.921 --> 37:10.053
I don't want our last day
to be one where

37:10.097 --> 37:12.708
we were at each other's throats.

37:12.752 --> 37:14.275
I know we're about
to lose everything,

37:14.319 --> 37:18.714
but I want to say thank you
for being my teammates.

37:18.758 --> 37:21.500
CATCHER:
Save the speeches for later.

37:21.543 --> 37:22.675

39:28.366 --> 39:29.889
There's fear markers
all over this guy.

39:29.932 --> 39:31.412
He's scared to pitch to you,

39:31.456 --> 39:33.109
but intentional walks
are illegal.

39:33.153 --> 39:34.894
He's just trying to make
your free pass

39:34.937 --> 39:36.417
look like an accident
so he can pitch to Patty,

39:36.461 --> 39:38.027
who's a great kid,
but only thing she ever hit

39:38.071 --> 39:39.202
was a "shift" key.

Well, your ego got us
into this mess.

How 'bout Carson's ego
gets us out of it?
