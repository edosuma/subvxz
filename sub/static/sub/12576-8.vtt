from the psychological approach.

12:34.418 --> 12:37.012
You heard him, Hank.
We have no legal responsibility.

12:37.087 --> 12:38.349
The caves?

12:38.422 --> 12:40.049
Oh, my God!

12:41.258 --> 12:44.056
KAHN: Wait! What's the problem?
That's good news, right?

12:44.128 --> 12:45.652
Now we know where they are.

12:45.729 --> 12:48.425
DALE: No, Kahn. Heap bad news.

12:48.799 --> 12:52.030
The caves are where
Arlen teenagers go to make...

12:52.102 --> 12:54.070
well, whoopee.

12:55.139 --> 12:56.163
[Joseph giggling]

12:56.240 --> 12:57.468
Check it out!

12:57.541 --> 13:00.203
BOBBY: It must have fallen off
some woman.

13:00.444 --> 13:03.277
JOSEPH: Here, Connie, you could use this.
CONNIE: Thanks.

13:05.382 --> 13:08.818
Hey, Connie! I found you this.

13:09.820 --> 13:11.344
Skoal. Yuck!

13:11.622 --> 13:13.487
And I wrote you a song.

13:16.093 --> 13:17.754
[Humming]

13:17.828 --> 13:20.353
[Unenthusiastically] Yeah, that's great.

13:21.398 --> 13:22.592
BOBBY: Dang!

13:23.667 --> 13:25.532
CONNIE: That was our last candle.

13:26.637 --> 13:29.037
CONNIE: I'm scared.
JOSEPH: Me, too.

13:29.106 --> 13:31.267
BOBBY: Me, three. Wait.

13:32.342 --> 13:34.537
We've got glow wands.

13:35.846 --> 13:37.814
[Dejected instrumental music]

13:40.751 --> 13:41.843
[Car approaching]

13:42.786 --> 13:43.810
[Dale panting]

13:43.887 --> 13:46.947
DALE: Those are their bikes.
They're inside, all right.

13:49.693 --> 13:52.218
Oh, God. I can't see.

13:52.329 --> 13:53.819
I can't see!

13:53.897 --> 13:55.694
We're all gonna die!

13:55.766 --> 13:58.462
Dale, you have your sunglasses on.

14:00.103 --> 14:01.263
Gotcha.

14:01.438 --> 14:02.632
Tell you what, Dale.

14:02.706 --> 14:06.403
Why don't you go tell Peggy and Minh
we're here, so they don't worry?

14:08.412 --> 14:12.075
I notice my wife's name was not
among those mentioned.

14:12.149 --> 14:15.516
Am I to assume Nancy
should continue worrying?

14:15.586 --> 14:17.076
You go now!

14:19.089 --> 14:20.989
DALE: Mayday!

14:22.359 --> 14:24.190
[Dale yelling]

14:26.196 --> 14:28.187
The kids are in the caves.

14:28.265 --> 14:32.258
My goodness! That is where half of Arlen's
unplanned pregnancies begin.

14:33.604 --> 14:36.437
Hank and Kahn have gone in
to pry them apart.

14:36.640 --> 14:40.269
Dear Lord, let them find those kids
before I am in-laws with Minh.

14:40.477 --> 14:41.466
[Spraying]

14:42.679 --> 14:44.271
Maybe we should get back now.

14:44.348 --> 14:46.179
Yeah, I guess.

14:47.084 --> 14:50.056
No, it's this way, isn't it?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.158
JOSEPH: No, we came in that way.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.349
I think.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.327
Oh, no.

14:56.797 --> 14:58.697
Yeah, we're lost.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.733
Take me to Boneyard.

15:07.808 --> 15:10.709
HANK: Hold on a second.
I don't remember which way to go.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.708
It's been a while.
I need to get my bearings, here.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.873
While you get your "bearings"...

15:15.949 --> 15:18.349
my child bearing your child's child.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.407
[Groans]

15:19.486 --> 15:20.510
[Stammering]

15:20.587 --> 15:22.452
I think it's this way.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.756
[Bobby munching]

15:27.327 --> 15:30.626
I can't stop. It's out of my control.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.064
Way to go! We're out of food!

15:34.201 --> 15:37.568
BOBBY: I'm sorry.
When I'm upset, I get hungry.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.733
We're all upset, Bobby.

15:39.806 --> 15:44.334
BOBBY: But you're upset together,
and I'm upset all by myself.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.203
I see things clearly now.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.441
I'm gonna grow up
without anyone to love...

15:49.516 --> 15:53.316
and die friendless and alone
like Weird Al Yankovich.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.112
I won't stand in your way.
When the time comes...

15:57.290 --> 15:59.053
I want you to eat me.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.289
You'd do that for us?

16:01.394 --> 16:04.227
Of course, I would. You're my best friends.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.929
My body is my gift to you.

16:07.267 --> 16:11.795
But it wouldn't have to be,
if you'd left us some of those chips.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.996
Bobby, that is so kind...

16:15.775 --> 16:18.266
and brave. Thank you.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.905
I'm doing it for your children, too.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.043
We have to think of them.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.576
NANCY: I'm starting to worry.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.779
Hank and Kahn
should've found them by now.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.379
Don't worry, Nancy. I'm sure they're safe...

16:30.457 --> 16:34.018
and not exploring each other's bodies.

16:34.261 --> 16:37.128
DALE: Even if they are,
there's nothing that lovers do...

16:37.197 --> 16:39.427
that could possibly take this long.

16:39.933 --> 16:40.991
Am I right?

16:41.067 --> 16:43.797
JOHN REDCORN: Yes, if you only consider
your own needs.

16:43.904 --> 16:47.101
Oh, gosh! I think I need a beer.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.073
Honey, you want a beer?

16:49.643 --> 16:51.668
DALE: Yes.
JOHN REDCORN: Yes.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.680
How did he know I wanted a beer?

16:57.851 --> 16:59.341
[Both grunting]

16:59.419 --> 17:01.353
Too narrow. Must go back.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.720
We've gotta go forward.
Come on! Shove me, dammit!

17:05.090 --> 17:06.217
[Kahn grunting]

17:06.292 --> 17:08.193
[Both shrieking]

17:08.828 --> 17:09.920
[Kahn exclaiming]

17:09.996 --> 17:11.896
Now I sticky with beer.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.123
This the worst birthday I ever had.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.097
I didn't know it was your birthday.

17:18.672 --> 17:19.934
I'm 41.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.611
You know, I think we're lost.

17:25.679 --> 17:27.407
You think so?

17:27.681 --> 17:30.411
Dale will bring the fire department.
They'll find us.

17:30.483 --> 17:35.318
That's great! All hopes for survival
pinned on Dale Gribble.

17:36.122 --> 17:39.148
I'm gonna die like a
English Patient girlfriend.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.725
Long, painful, boring death!

17:41.861 --> 17:44.921
Well, if we're lost,
the kids are probably lost, too.

17:44.998 --> 17:47.626
You make me nervous.
That Joseph with Kahn Jr.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.928
His whole family
like a Tennessee Williams play.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.062
Well, Joseph's a good boy.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.831
Say, why aren't you nervous
about my Bobby?

17:55.942 --> 17:58.843
Until puberty, he do no worse
than a hickey.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.812
Besides, I know he a good boy.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.278
I appreciate that, Kahn, but I tell you what.

18:04.351 --> 18:07.445
Many a good boy's gone bad
in the Boneyard.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.714
I shouldn't be telling you this...

18:09.789 --> 18:13.281
but it's where a lot of us
got to second base for the first time.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.089
What you call second base?

18:15.695 --> 18:17.060
[Laughing nervously]

18:17.197 --> 18:19.995
Well, where I come from...

18:20.300 --> 18:21.324
[Hank clears throat]

18:21.401 --> 18:22.891
It means...

18:23.003 --> 18:23.992
Well...

18:24.304 --> 18:25.430
[Voice cracking]

18:26.506 --> 18:30.840
Meaning that... You see, when two people
are attracted to each other...

18:31.077 --> 18:32.806
well, your hand...

18:32.879 --> 18:35.575
Don't explain a home run,
you'll have a heart attack.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.980
In Laos we call it pa son pate.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.909
"Pa son pate."

18:40.453 --> 18:42.887
I like it. It sounds clean.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.781
We need more good euphemisms like that
in this country.

18:46.860 --> 18:51.194
So, tell me,
where did you hit your first pa son pate?

18:51.398 --> 18:54.731
Louangphrabang City. Wild town, man.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.598
Spring break,
and two out of three guys are monks.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.638
Try not get some pa son pate.

19:00.173 --> 19:02.664
[Both laughing]

19:03.810 --> 19:06.438
[Laughing continues]

19:08.381 --> 19:11.145
Hey, Bobby! That sounds like your dad.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.246
And that sounds like your dad, Connie.

19:15.088 --> 19:18.023
It can't be.
They're not yelling at each other.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.553

19:36.209 --> 19:37.836
Hello, Joseph.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.310
Hey, Mr. Hill.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.607
KAHN: Well, now we all together.

19:41.681 --> 19:45.048
Sit back and relax.
Wait for Dale Gribble to save us.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.921
Son, stop that.
This is a desperate situation.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.855
Besides, it's littering.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.731
It's already littered, Dad.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.396
Somebody else dropped it before us...

20:05.472 --> 20:06.769
from up there.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.531
Hey, there is a hole up there. Look.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.736
That could be our way out!

20:12.112 --> 20:14.307
Hey, hold your fire up there!

20:14.380 --> 20:16.905
BOOMHAUER: What're you doing
in the old... Hank...

20:16.983 --> 20:18.575
...doing down there in the Boneyard?

20:18.651 --> 20:22.212
...get down in there, don't wander around,
what's wrong with you, man?

20:22.288 --> 20:26.190
Boomhauer, I can't understand a word
you're saying!

20:26.326 --> 20:30.194
Must be the echo! Just get
the fire department to lower a rope!

20:30.263 --> 20:33.130
BOOMHAUER: Hey, Hank, ten-four to go
to lower that rope.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.093
[All exclaiming]

20:37.504 --> 20:39.369
My little golden child!

20:40.640 --> 20:42.039
[Both sighing]

20:47.213 --> 20:49.374
Okay, Hank, put Bobby's bike in the trunk...

20:49.449 --> 20:52.907
and buckle him into the back seat,
facing us, so we both can watch him.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.477
Now, Peggy, he's not a baby anymore.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.683
He's a preteen.
He and Joseph rode their bikes here.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.123
They can ride them home.

21:00.193 --> 21:01.490
Thanks, Dad.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.090
Connie, you need a lift?

21:05.165 --> 21:07.190
Yeah, Connie. You want a lift?

21:09.068 --> 21:11.161
Kahn Jr., you come with me.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.133
We go get ice cream and tetanus shot.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.944
I think Connie likes you.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.343
[Joseph mutters]

21:20.647 --> 21:22.205
She likes you.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.645
The minute you said we could eat you,
she was yours.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.050
Well, maybe she likes both of us.

21:28.488 --> 21:32.481
Yeah, women have trouble
choosing between guys sometimes.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.885
They like to have their cake, and eat it, too.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.494
I hear you.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.426
BOBBY: Hey, Joseph.
JOSEPH: Yeah?

21:39.933 --> 21:42.026
What were you eating under there?

21:42.101 --> 21:43.625
Under where?

21:44.537 --> 21:46.937
BOBBY: You were eating underwear!

21:47.006 --> 21:49.108
JOSEPH: Shut up!
BOBBY: Boxers or briefs?

21:49.108 --> 21:50.315
JOSEPH: You are such a goof!
