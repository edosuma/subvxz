WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:03.201
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.296 --> 00:05.412
Chiana:
What's he doing here?
What does he want?

00:05.506 --> 00:06.461
He wants asylum.

00:06.549 --> 00:09.416
A relationship is
based on trust.

00:09.510 --> 00:13.128
ldidn't wanna tell you about
the pregnancy until I was sure.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.304
Noranti:
Distillate of Laka.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.632
One whiff and the pain is gone.

00:17.727 --> 00:19.388
It's to help him move on.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.220
Surmount his feelings
and forget.

00:23.566 --> 00:27.309
And now on Farscape.

00:27.403 --> 00:31.237
Scorpius:
Pilot, why is that trading
vessel still aboard?

00:31.324 --> 00:34.282
The negotiation is
proving difficult.

00:34.368 --> 00:38.281
These traders are asking
exorbitant prices
for their maps,

00:38.372 --> 00:43.457
yet we dare not traverse
Tormented Space, without
reliable star charts.

00:43.544 --> 00:48.379
For 5,000 crindars I want maps
that are current and authentic.

00:48.466 --> 00:49.922
I said ten.

00:50.009 --> 00:52.250
And she said five.

00:52.345 --> 00:55.382
Buy your maps elsewhere.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.924
Are you so sure another buyer
will come along?

01:07.360 --> 01:08.520
What?

01:09.946 --> 01:12.528
Nothing's bothering me.

01:12.615 --> 01:14.196
Something I said?

01:17.286 --> 01:19.322
Must have been something
I said.

01:20.873 --> 01:24.206
Trader:
9,000. No more talk.

01:24.293 --> 01:27.035
Except to say goodbye.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.957
Seven.

01:30.049 --> 01:32.210
Final offer.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.222
The Dominar will pay you.

01:41.978 --> 01:44.310
Scorpius:
You look unusually smug.

01:44.397 --> 01:46.479
Your deal. It was successful?

01:46.565 --> 01:49.693
You have no idea.
(giggles )

01:49.777 --> 01:51.733
One more trade.

01:51.821 --> 01:53.903
No tricks.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.528
We enjoyed her.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.159
Plenty of good pleasure left.

02:04.250 --> 02:07.037
No value to an old woman, but...

02:07.128 --> 02:09.835
but to men...
( lecherous chuckle )

02:11.007 --> 02:13.589
Touch her again, you fekik,
and you die!

02:14.927 --> 02:16.167
Calm down.

02:16.262 --> 02:20.255
D'Argo:
Chiana, this is not
our problem.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.965
Well have you forgotten what
it's like to be a prisoner?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.891
800 crindars.

02:25.438 --> 02:27.429
Bargain.

02:28.399 --> 02:30.390
She's yours.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.227
Chiana:
We can't just leave her.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.323
Okay.

02:40.411 --> 02:41.821
I'll buy her myself
if I have to.

02:41.912 --> 02:45.404
You brought that Vorc onto
Moya, remember?

02:45.499 --> 02:47.239
What's your name?

02:48.252 --> 02:50.334
Talika.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.207
Talika.

02:56.552 --> 02:59.134
Okay, here's the deal.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.963
We take her, or I take
her head off.

03:02.058 --> 03:04.299
Rygel:
Shoot her. She's nothing to me.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.349
Rygel...

03:06.437 --> 03:07.597
pay them.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.394
But, uh...
-Pay them!

03:09.482 --> 03:11.438
Chrichton:
Sparky, cough it up.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.025
Trader:
A smart purchase.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.363
You'll have fun with her.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.903
(shrieks)

03:17.990 --> 03:19.776
D'Argo:
This is a bad idea.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.277
Nine times out of ten.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.860
First nice planet we find,
we'll drop her off.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.871
This isn't... no, no,
I'm a friend.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.415
A friend.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.716
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.509
Chiana, grab her!
-Whoa.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.837
Chrichton:
Take it easy.
We're not gonna hurt you.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.140
Oh!

03:47.228 --> 03:49.093
Okay, hold her! Grab her!

03:55.903 --> 03:58.519
Okay, take her to your room.

03:58.614 --> 04:01.572
She is your responsibility.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.076
Hey.

04:06.622 --> 04:09.034
Talika, come on.

04:09.125 --> 04:11.741
I'll get you some food,
some better clothes.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.915
( low growl )

04:16.006 --> 04:19.169
Pilot:
The trading vessel is
now leaving Moya.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.875
D'Argo:
Good.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.182
So you're angry with me?

04:33.315 --> 04:34.145
Let's talk.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.564
I don't want to talk.

04:35.651 --> 04:36.857
Aeryn.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.289
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:52.376 --> 04:55.868
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.749
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

04:57.840 --> 05:01.048
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

05:01.135 --> 05:02.796
my friends.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.674
I've made enemies.

05:05.764 --> 05:09.006
Powerful, dangerous.

05:09.101 --> 05:12.593
Now all I want is to
find a way home

05:12.688 --> 05:15.395
to warn Earth.

05:15.483 --> 05:20.568
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

05:50.559 --> 05:51.765
Aeryn:
There's nothing to say.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.763
The hell there's not!
You hit me!

05:53.854 --> 05:55.719
You lied to me.
-Hey, you lied to me.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.941
You said nothing was
bothering you.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.232
Okay, so I did not tell you
about the poppers.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.559
You did not tell me
about the baby.

06:01.654 --> 06:03.770
Does that mean I get to
hit you now?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.479
I would not advise that.

06:05.574 --> 06:06.905
Oh?

06:06.992 --> 06:10.610
You do not scare me, missy.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.115
Okay.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.246
You scare me a little.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.797
You want the truth?

06:23.884 --> 06:27.126
l was taking that crap
from Noranti...

06:29.014 --> 06:31.005
to forget you.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.683
But you gotta admit...

06:37.314 --> 06:39.225
...it's kind of romantic.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.397
I'm just crazy about you.

06:45.114 --> 06:47.070
So, it's my fault?

06:47.157 --> 06:48.363
No.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.324
What?

06:51.412 --> 06:52.948
You should have been stronger.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.245
Oh, God, Aeryn, please!

06:55.332 --> 06:57.994
Get... honey, give me a break!
l'm weak.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.792
l'm human. I'm a guy.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.333
What is the matter?

07:03.424 --> 07:05.335
Aeryn, I'm fine.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.045
We're gonna be fine.

07:12.641 --> 07:16.350
No. We're not.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.302
Aeryn, do not walk away.

07:18.397 --> 07:22.015
Much as I love it when you
walk away. Aeryn!

07:25.404 --> 07:27.611
We're gonna be fine.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.273
She likes me.

07:31.327 --> 07:36.242
Wow! That's much better.

07:36.332 --> 07:38.539
(giggles )
Fits great.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.332
It looks nice.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.000
Mmm.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.703
It looks, uh...

07:44.798 --> 07:46.584
sexy.

07:47.343 --> 07:49.834
What is "sexy"?

07:49.928 --> 07:52.670
Oh, a girl as beautiful
as you shouldn't...

07:52.765 --> 07:55.723
shouldn't have to ask that.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.427
Sexy is, um...

08:04.902 --> 08:06.688
Sexy.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.442
You like sexy?

08:13.869 --> 08:15.655
Yeah.

08:18.207 --> 08:21.165
It's my, uh...

08:21.251 --> 08:23.583
It's my favorite color.

08:25.047 --> 08:30.383
Makes you feel good
knowing men want you.

08:33.138 --> 08:37.256
Oh, sorry I...

08:37.351 --> 08:39.592
M-Most men aren't...

08:39.687 --> 08:42.224
aren't like those traders.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.350
Most men are, uh...

08:44.441 --> 08:46.432
are pretty drad.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.273
You like men for sex?

08:50.364 --> 08:53.026
They're, uh...

08:53.117 --> 08:55.028
they're good for other things.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.657
But they're great for sex.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.120
Just men?

09:09.508 --> 09:11.715
You like this?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.426
Is this sex?

09:21.645 --> 09:23.510
It's...

09:23.605 --> 09:25.891
it's getting pretty close.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.458
Chiana.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.207
Okay, what is your problem?

09:53.302 --> 09:55.338
That the only reason why you
brought her aboard?

09:55.429 --> 09:58.136
So you can make her
your toy now?

09:58.807 --> 10:00.798
Uh...

10:00.893 --> 10:03.305
We were just talking.

10:03.854 --> 10:06.095
Girl stuff.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.347
Oh, come on.

10:08.442 --> 10:11.275
| get feisty.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.319
I'm not like you.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.146
You don't need it. I do.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.742
It's not a crime.

10:17.826 --> 10:22.115
This is excessive, even
for you, Chiana.

10:22.206 --> 10:26.245
Well, if you're not into it,
I could always ask Crichton.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.247
You mind?

10:31.340 --> 10:33.296
Do what you want.

10:38.889 --> 10:42.177
( Crichton whistling )

10:43.727 --> 10:47.015
Hey! Hey, how you doin'?
Come on in.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.187
Uh, sorry about the mess.

10:50.234 --> 10:54.102
Chocolate?
It's fresh from Earth.

10:54.196 --> 10:56.903
Don't be afraid. Come on in.
We're friends.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.784
Forsex?

10:59.868 --> 11:01.028
( chuckles )

11:01.119 --> 11:04.077
No. That's a different
kind of friend.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.449
That's a special friend.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.782
( laughs )

11:07.876 --> 11:10.253
A special friend.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.202
Like you and Aeryn.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.455
How did you...

11:15.425 --> 11:18.383
Oh. Chiana, right?

11:18.470 --> 11:21.712
Chiana, yes.

11:21.807 --> 11:24.219
But I can see it for myself.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.265
Anyone can.

11:26.353 --> 11:31.438
You are hers and she is yours.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.063
Or am I wrong?

11:35.153 --> 11:37.815
No, you're right.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.526
You're absolutely right.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.279
(both laugh)

11:47.374 --> 11:50.286
These maps look legitimate.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.959
Information about the dangerous
sectors is accurate.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.957
It should be easy for us
to evade them.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.127
Looks like the old witch
actually did a good job.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.958
Don't I get any credit?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.008
What for?

12:01.096 --> 12:02.302
( chuckles )

12:02.389 --> 12:05.222
Look closely at that.
Read me the amount.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.140
100 crindars.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.058
It's really only a
twelfth of that.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.761
I added the extra digit.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.721
Fine handiwork,
don't you think?

12:12.816 --> 12:14.226
You cheated the Traders?

12:14.318 --> 12:16.309
That's right. More for me.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.439
Do you know what you've done,
you selfish little trot?!

12:18.530 --> 12:21.317
The traders control this part
of Tormented Space!

12:21.408 --> 12:23.273
The greebols won't even notice.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.859
They will notice, you lying,
cheating, little...

12:25.954 --> 12:27.819
Fellas, knock it...
knock it off!

12:27.915 --> 12:29.701
Break! Break!

12:31.251 --> 12:33.082
Neutral corners.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.831
What is the problem?

12:34.922 --> 12:39.165
This little piece of dren
gave the traders
counterfeit crindars.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.170
Not counterfeit, just altered.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.252
Sparky, what do you wanna
do that for?

12:43.347 --> 12:46.134
These are not the guys
we wanna piss off.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.715
We have to be out here for a
while and we need to be
able to do business.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.517
And now he's ruined that
for us. When they find out
they've been cheated...

12:51.605 --> 12:53.186
I'm telling you they won't.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.138
Those forgeries would
fool anyone.

12:55.233 --> 12:58.771
Ryg, you can't do stuff like
this. You're jamming us up.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.319
Crichton, can't you see
the damage he has done us?

13:01.406 --> 13:03.317
When they come for us,
I'm gonna give them you!

13:03.408 --> 13:05.319
They can enjoy you as much
as they like!

13:05.410 --> 13:07.526
D, it's not gonna solve
the problem.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.158
Relax. Have a seat.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.034
Have a bite to eat.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.332
Get away from those!
They're mine!

13:14.419 --> 13:16.330
You selfish little dren!

13:16.421 --> 13:17.536
( snarling )

13:17.631 --> 13:19.292
Chill! Chill, huh?

13:19.383 --> 13:22.125
It's under control. All right?

13:22.219 --> 13:24.551
We're gonna make it right.
We're gonna phone these guys,

13:24.638 --> 13:27.380
we're gonna tell them we made
a mistake and we're gonna
make it right.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.884
Are you fahrbot?

13:28.976 --> 13:31.388
I'm the captain here.
I'll deal with it.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.979
And then I'll deal with you!

13:33.063 --> 13:35.930
Just keep your hands
off my property.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.231
D, let him... let him go. D!

13:40.445 --> 13:42.231
(grunts)

13:45.033 --> 13:48.400
Pilot, can you get that trading
ship on the phone?
-|'|| try, Commander.

13:48.495 --> 13:53.990
But this area of Tormented
Space is making transmissions
very unreliable.

13:54.084 --> 13:57.451
You can do it, man. You're smart
enough, you're good enough,

13:57.546 --> 14:00.208
and doggone it, people like you.

14:00.298 --> 14:04.337
Are you all right, Crichton?

14:04.428 --> 14:07.010
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in
Chiana's quarters.

14:07.097 --> 14:10.339
I don't have to listen to you.
No one else does.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.220
Nobody listens to you.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.767
They listen to Crichton,
but not to you.

14:14.855 --> 14:19.690
Get back to those quarters or
I will throw you off
this ship myself!

14:19.776 --> 14:21.607
( hisses )
(gasps )

14:27.325 --> 14:32.991
Noranti seems to think that
everyone's acting very
strangely.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.281
(sighs)

14:36.376 --> 14:38.207
And what do you think?

14:38.295 --> 14:39.751
They are agitated.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.753
Unusually emotional.
Everyone except Aeryn.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.301
She's colder than usual.

14:53.018 --> 14:57.227
She wills herself
against emotions.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.313
Like any good soldier.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.311
Chiana:
You.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.520
On the table.

15:06.615 --> 15:07.855
Right now.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.109
Yeah. W-What's gotten into you?

15:09.201 --> 15:11.192
Nothing... yet!

15:11.286 --> 15:13.823
( laughter)

15:13.914 --> 15:15.324
Oh... oh... oh... okay.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.748
I just figured out what you
need. You need a cold shower.

15:18.835 --> 15:22.248
It's okay. I asked Aeryn.
-Whoo!

15:22.339 --> 15:24.455
She said she didn't care
about ya anyway.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.664
( mischievous chuckle)

15:25.759 --> 15:27.465
Yes, she does.
-No, she doesn't.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.008
We're happy. She loves me.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.678
Chiana:
Oh, come on.
You know you want it.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.550
John!

15:33.642 --> 15:36.304
Oh, hey, Scorp!

15:36.770 --> 15:38.431
Hey, Scorpy!

15:39.689 --> 15:41.896
You wanna watch?

15:41.983 --> 15:43.689
Crichton:
Ah, there ain't nothin'
here to see.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.392
We're done.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.269
You're leaving.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.730
Hezmana to you.

15:49.825 --> 15:52.692
What she do? Cut 'em off?

15:58.917 --> 16:01.374
(growling)

16:03.880 --> 16:05.416
Crichton:
Whoa!

16:05.507 --> 16:06.713
How about that? Kids.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.462
( laughing ):
Man, she's in overdrive today.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.509
She's not alone.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.304
How are you feeling?

16:15.392 --> 16:17.758
Good. Never better.

16:17.853 --> 16:22.267
We got a little, uh, thing
going on with the traders but,
uh, that's not a problem.

16:22.357 --> 16:25.099
We do have a problem.

16:25.193 --> 16:28.856
Your crewmates are behaving
very oddly.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.814
Ah, that's par for the course
around here, grasshopper.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.899
Don't worry about it.
-Noranti does not think so.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.952
Well, Noranti imagines things.
We're fine.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.120
But you are not fine, John.

16:39.207 --> 16:43.450
Nor is Chiana, Aeryn,
Rygel, D'Argo.

16:43.545 --> 16:48.505
Your behavior has changed since
that girl came onboard.

16:49.801 --> 16:53.134
You think Talika is doing
a T'raltixx?

16:53.221 --> 16:55.507
A mind frell? Right.

16:55.599 --> 16:58.306
Let's go talk to her. Come on.
She's in Chiana's quarters.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.135
No, she isn't.

17:01.229 --> 17:04.892
She's disappeared and we
can not find her.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.738
Aeryn:
There she is.

17:10.822 --> 17:13.108
Talika! It's all right.
It's all right.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.191
Everything's gonna be all right.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.697
We're not gonna hurt you.
Don't be afraid.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.161
We got her. Tier Three
Maintenance Bay.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.747
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.008
Talika.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.219
Talika...

17:42.520 --> 17:43.930
(whispering ):
It's all right.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.263
We know she's here.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.730
( loud screech )

18:11.633 --> 18:14.796
(soft gasps and sighs)

18:14.886 --> 18:17.218
What the frell happened?

18:17.305 --> 18:19.591
I heard a scream.

18:21.434 --> 18:25.302
Yeah, me too.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.183
Then the lights went out.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.810
What is that?

18:28.900 --> 18:29.855
What?

18:29.943 --> 18:31.433
That.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.393
Ow.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.194
I don't...

18:35.282 --> 18:38.900
You got something. Right there.

18:38.994 --> 18:40.234
( groans )

18:40.328 --> 18:42.159
This is all your fault.
You brought her onto the ship.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.239
I should have let you shoot
her. In fact, I should have
shot her myself.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.664
You're not gonna hurt her.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.366
You both owe me currency.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.419
Everybody on this ship owes me,
and I've been far too patient.

18:51.506 --> 18:52.871
I want it now.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.126
Rygel, shut up.

18:54.217 --> 18:57.175
Crichton:
D'Argo? Hey, listen up, man.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.548
Talika's a lot more dangerous
than she looks.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.175
Big surprise.

19:01.266 --> 19:04.975
Yeah, she's... she's got
some kind of scream that
knocked us flat.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.393
We followed her to the
Tier Three Bay,

19:07.480 --> 19:12.190
but... I don't know.
She could be anywhere by now.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.408
( screeching )

19:24.581 --> 19:26.321
D'Argo?

19:45.101 --> 19:47.683
( soft gasps )

19:49.522 --> 19:52.480
(soft whirling)

20:01.868 --> 20:04.450
( clicking )

20:06.373 --> 20:10.707
(screeching and screaming )

20:16.966 --> 20:18.422
( growls )

20:28.061 --> 20:30.427
( growls softly )

20:37.904 --> 20:40.566
I will kill your attacker.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.826
I promise.

20:43.910 --> 20:47.573
Noranti:
Save her first! Get her limbs!

20:47.664 --> 20:50.030
Aeryn:
I don't understand why
she's doing this.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.537
I actually felt sorry for her,
but she's going to kill us all.

20:52.627 --> 20:53.912
We have to do something.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.130
Just... just give me
a minute, will ya?

20:56.214 --> 20:58.830
I feel like crap.
Whatever she did...

20:58.925 --> 21:01.086
knocked the wind
out of my sails.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.257
Listen, we won't have
much time.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.256
She could be anywhere,
and we have to find her.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.303
Damn, woman.
Would you give it a rest?

21:06.391 --> 21:10.259
No. Look, please don't be
useless. Don't be... useless.

21:10.353 --> 21:11.183
John...

21:11.271 --> 21:13.102
Oh, she got you too?

21:13.189 --> 21:14.645
Yeah, I'm, uh...

21:14.732 --> 21:16.268
I'm not exactly sure how.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.850
She must have snuck up
from behind us.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.022
I don't feel so right.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.400
(slurring ):
Neither do |. So weak...

21:23.491 --> 21:27.029
No, we can't be weak. We have
to pull ourselves together and
we have to fight back.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.362
With what? She kicked our
asses. Just give it up.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.413
No, we can't.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.745
We can't!

21:35.670 --> 21:37.410
What? What's with Aeryn?

21:37.505 --> 21:40.417
D'Argo:
We just have to talk to Talika,
find outwhy she attacked us.

21:40.508 --> 21:41.918
Pilot, do you know
where she is?

21:42.010 --> 21:45.298
The DRDs are searching,
but no luck so far.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.720
Crichton:
She can probably turn invisible.
We're never gonna find her.

21:47.807 --> 21:52.301
Additionally, the trading
vessel has changed course and
is now heading toward Moya.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.602
We cannot establish
communication.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.725
Well, their intentions
could be hostile.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.352
Crichton:
Of course they're hostile.

21:58.443 --> 22:02.277
Rygel screwed them. They're
coming back to screw us.

22:02.363 --> 22:04.228
Then let the traders come.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.315
We'll... we'll give them
everything they want.

22:06.409 --> 22:11.073
All the currency we have.
It's only brought us
conflict anyway.

22:11.623 --> 22:12.783
Okay.

22:12.874 --> 22:15.456
Something very... very weird
is going on.

22:15.543 --> 22:19.331
Aeryn... is falling apart.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.215
Rygel is...

22:21.299 --> 22:23.290
is not greedy at all and...

22:23.384 --> 22:25.215
and you're giving up.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.793
And you're not even angry.

22:26.888 --> 22:29.550
Well, I have no reason
to be angry.

22:29.641 --> 22:31.506
I believe with dialogue
and compromise...

22:31.601 --> 22:32.306
(yells)

22:32.393 --> 22:33.382
(gasps )

22:34.646 --> 22:37.137
There is a reason to be angry.

22:37.232 --> 22:40.895
I really don't see how that
is gonna help...

22:40.985 --> 22:41.940
(gasps )

22:43.655 --> 22:46.146
Okay. How 'bout that?

22:46.241 --> 22:47.356
(sighs)

22:48.910 --> 22:50.275
(yells)

22:52.121 --> 22:53.952
Still not angry?

22:54.040 --> 22:55.450
No, I'm not.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.908
I should be...

22:58.002 --> 22:59.378
but I'm not.

22:59.462 --> 23:02.875
It's... it's like she's taken
our strongest trait away.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.753
She didn't take anything
away from you.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.965
Okay.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.220
What?

23:15.311 --> 23:17.518
Just... just put them right...

23:17.605 --> 23:19.846
right here.
( sighs )

23:19.941 --> 23:21.431
Okay, now just... just do it.

23:21.526 --> 23:23.983
I... I really don't want...
-D'Argo, come on.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.276
I can't in front of them.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.274
Just do it.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.822
(sighs)

23:40.003 --> 23:43.166
No. No tingle?

23:45.800 --> 23:48.291
No... no nothing.

23:49.637 --> 23:53.471
That tralk has... has taken
away my sex drive.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.605
Apply pressure...

24:01.941 --> 24:04.182
and her limbs should reattach.

24:04.277 --> 24:07.394
Crichton:
Pilot, has that trader
ship responded?

24:07.488 --> 24:10.150
No. Our signal still isn't
getting through.

24:10.241 --> 24:15.406
And the trader's vessel now
appears to be... drifting.

24:15.496 --> 24:18.829
D'Argo:
Well, with our Comms out the
trader ship's probably powered down

24:18.916 --> 24:20.781
to signal they mean no harm.

24:20.877 --> 24:23.289
Pilot, prepare the docking web
to bring them aboard.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.121
Pilot, why haven't you found
that frelling Talika?

24:26.215 --> 24:28.422
Her movements are
extraordinary.

24:28.509 --> 24:33.424
The moment the DRD locates her,
she's gone again.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.723
You. This is all your fault.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.926
Aeryn! Whoa, no, no,
that's not helping.

24:40.021 --> 24:44.185
All right.
-Ooh, ooh. Settle.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.307
Sorry.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.274
(softly gasping )

25:03.294 --> 25:06.036
(softly gasping )

25:09.300 --> 25:11.882
Now we know how it ends.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.765
( sniffs )

25:40.248 --> 25:43.240
This is what we gotta look
forward to?

25:46.921 --> 25:50.584
Rygel:
By my reckoning, we won't
have to wait that long.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.415
Don't...

25:52.510 --> 25:54.626
say that.

25:54.721 --> 25:57.053
We're gonna be fine.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.425
We're gonna be fine.

25:58.516 --> 26:02.225
We're gonna find something,
we're gonna figure it all out

26:02.311 --> 26:05.098
and we are going to be fine.

26:11.404 --> 26:12.735
(gasps )

26:16.617 --> 26:18.198
What happened?

26:19.287 --> 26:22.950
(choking and gasping)

26:26.753 --> 26:30.416
Diagnosan:
I now have information on the
symptoms you've described.

26:30.506 --> 26:33.122
They're caused by the
Wolaxian arachnid.

26:33.217 --> 26:38.302
This creature's touch infects
its victims and stimulates
exaggerated neural functioning.

26:38.389 --> 26:41.131
That sounds like us.

26:41.225 --> 26:45.935
The creature then transforms,
harvests that energy
from its host,

26:46.022 --> 26:49.765
stores it in membrane orbs
and hides those orbs

26:49.859 --> 26:52.100
in an external nest for
later consumption.

26:52.195 --> 26:56.484
Finding that nest and opening
the orbs in proximity
to the victims

26:56.574 --> 27:01.193
will allow reassimilation of the
energy and complete recovery.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.160
What?

27:03.247 --> 27:05.238
We... we have to get it back.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.823
We have to know how to
kill the creature.

27:06.918 --> 27:07.907
Get him back!

27:08.002 --> 27:10.084
Killing Talika isn't
the problem.

27:10.171 --> 27:12.002
Finding the energy orb is.

27:12.089 --> 27:15.252
Really? You think she's not
gonna try and defend her nest?

27:15.343 --> 27:16.423
(sighs)

27:16.511 --> 27:17.421
What?

27:17.512 --> 27:19.343
Relax.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.720
Noranti:
Sikozu...

27:29.524 --> 27:30.684
( soft gasps )

27:30.775 --> 27:33.187
No. No. No.
-Hold her still.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.188
( screams )

27:35.279 --> 27:36.610
I was... I was attacked.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.824
I was attacked.
-We know. D'Argo commed.

27:38.908 --> 27:42.116
It was a Wolaxian arachnid.
Lie still. You're safe now.

27:42.203 --> 27:43.409
My arm and my leg.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.454
Focus your mind on
healing yourself.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.702
Your limbs may still be saved.

27:48.793 --> 27:51.125
The arachnid seeks to
harvest neural energy.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.328
Why did it attack you?

27:53.422 --> 27:55.834
Are you immune to its touch?

27:56.676 --> 27:57.586
Yes.

27:57.677 --> 27:59.042
(gagS)

27:59.136 --> 28:00.467
Yes. I must be immune.

28:00.555 --> 28:02.295
(gagS)

28:02.390 --> 28:03.425
Scorpius.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.472
Yes, he's infected but
not harvested.

28:05.560 --> 28:10.395
She's doing well, Scorpius.
You may leave her now.

28:10.481 --> 28:13.063
The Scarran in him is
growing stronger.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.607
Overcoming his Sebacean
personality.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.151
I must stop him.

28:17.238 --> 28:18.569
Keep him from harming us.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.988
No, he will not harm us.
I know him.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.815
(growling)

28:24.412 --> 28:26.198
You know only his
Sebacean side.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.287
(Scorpius grunting )

28:29.375 --> 28:31.161
Kill it now!

28:31.252 --> 28:33.288
First, we must find its orbs.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.960
Kill it now!

28:35.047 --> 28:37.254
Forgive me, Scorpius.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.296
(grunts)

28:42.847 --> 28:44.257
(mumbling)

28:44.348 --> 28:45.463
No!

28:50.313 --> 28:54.101
Pilot:
The DRDs last saw Talika
in the Neural Cluster,

28:54.191 --> 28:57.558
but they are unable to locate
her nest of energy orbs.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.939
So, we're screwed.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.110
Would ya stop talking
like that?

29:03.200 --> 29:07.193
Aeryn:
Well, we can't be like this.
We have... we have to focus.

29:07.288 --> 29:08.994
All right, I say we team up.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.244
We start in the Neural Cluster,
and we search every
tier ourselves.

29:12.335 --> 29:15.919
Chiana:
And we'll either find the orbs
or we'll find the chak that took 'em.

29:16.005 --> 29:19.964
Or perhaps we could persuade
Talika to return the
energy orbs.

29:20.051 --> 29:23.885
Rygel:
Let's "persuade" her with
a Pulse Rifle.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.257
Come on.

29:26.349 --> 29:28.886
Whoa. Hang on a second.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.183
I'm just...

29:31.270 --> 29:33.056
dizzy.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.981
You know what the worst
part of this is?

29:40.237 --> 29:42.228
You and me.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.902
We never could get it together.

29:54.418 --> 29:56.704
Now we never will.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.830
Don't you ever talk like that.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.757
Come on.

30:27.827 --> 30:31.160
(engines revving )

30:36.002 --> 30:39.620
Rygel:
Captain D'Argo, the trading
ship's engines are powering up.

30:39.714 --> 30:41.250
It must be Talika.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.422
I can't seal the outer
doors in time.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.669
You've gotta stop her.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.422
It's too late.
The vessel has left Moya.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.721
Crichton, Aeryn, Rygel, Chiana,
get aboard Lo'La, and fast!

30:50.808 --> 30:54.266
Aeryn, l-l can't... I can't
keep up. Go without me.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.390
What?

31:01.318 --> 31:02.933
No.

31:04.697 --> 31:07.279
Forget about me and go.

31:20.046 --> 31:22.788
(loud rumbling)

31:25.968 --> 31:29.836
I don't know about the rest of
you, but we should probably get
this done quite quickly.

31:29.930 --> 31:33.422
(flatulence)

31:38.272 --> 31:41.184
Damn it, boy.
Make yourself useful.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.558
Come on.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.277
We're almost within range.

31:51.368 --> 31:54.610
Their weapons aren't charged
up. They're not taking any
evasive action.

31:54.705 --> 31:56.081
Should be easy to board.

31:56.165 --> 31:59.578
We might be walking
into a trap.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.659
Agreed.

32:01.754 --> 32:03.119
Okay,

32:03.214 --> 32:05.580
Rygel, you stay here and
watch that scanner.

32:05.674 --> 32:08.416
If it senses any movement,
comm us.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.087
This is all my fault.

32:12.181 --> 32:14.547
I'm sorry about this.

32:14.642 --> 32:17.384
I'll kill that tralk myself.

32:28.155 --> 32:31.272
Rygel. Any movement?

32:31.367 --> 32:34.450
No. Just you three.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.592
Chiana:
Nothing here but corpses.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.468
Oh, this is klempt.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.263
She's gotta be here.

33:01.355 --> 33:03.687
Oh... frell.

33:03.774 --> 33:05.355
(electronic beeps )

33:05.442 --> 33:08.149
The guidance system's
been activated.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.148
This ship is set to fly itself.

33:10.239 --> 33:12.525
She never left Moya.

33:13.909 --> 33:16.901
D'Argo:
John, the trader ship is empty.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.203
Talika used it as a decoy.

33:19.290 --> 33:20.700
So, she wasn't there?

33:20.791 --> 33:22.873
No. She must still be
aboard Moya.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.621
We're heading back now, but...

33:24.712 --> 33:26.202
but we're very weak.

33:26.297 --> 33:29.334
You have to find those
energy orbs.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.416
We're all dead without them.

33:35.598 --> 33:37.054
Noranti:
Get up!

33:37.141 --> 33:39.427
(grunts and groans)

33:41.478 --> 33:43.434
Now, are you ready to die?

33:43.522 --> 33:46.059
Are you ready to watch
Aeryn die?

33:46.150 --> 33:47.731
Now Crichton, without
those orbs...

33:47.818 --> 33:52.107
She could have hid them
anywhere. Moya's huge.
We'll never find 'em.

33:53.407 --> 33:56.399
That's it!

33:56.493 --> 33:59.951
Talika is the only one who
knows where they are.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.781
Yeah, so we're dead.
She's never gonna tell us.

34:02.875 --> 34:07.244
No, no. But maybe we can get
her to show us where they are.

34:07.338 --> 34:12.048
Now, Scorpius is infected
but not yet harvested.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.177
Why not?

34:14.261 --> 34:16.252
Well, I made him unconscious.

34:16.347 --> 34:18.679
Now, perhaps she can't
sense him,

34:18.766 --> 34:22.304
even though he is ripe
and ready for her.

34:25.064 --> 34:31.230
So, we... wake him up, use
him as bait, let her
harvest his mojo.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.608
And then we follow her,
and we find all the orbs.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.659
What about Sikozu?

34:37.743 --> 34:40.280
Well, she's strong enough
to help, I'm sure.

34:45.084 --> 34:47.245
Crichton:
We may not be dead.

34:47.962 --> 34:49.247
( softly ):
Yet.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.954
Well, sounds like you're almost
back to your old self.

34:52.049 --> 34:56.258
We should, uh... we should be
back to you within an em.

34:56.345 --> 34:59.257
Sikozu:
Here, swallow this.

35:01.892 --> 35:05.384
Wake up. Scorpius.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.728
We need you.

35:08.816 --> 35:12.149
( snarls )
(gasps )

35:12.236 --> 35:14.147
( snarling )
(Sikozu gasping)

35:14.238 --> 35:17.355
You don't want to hurt me,
Scorpius.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.485
I'm an ally.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.652
Sikozu?

35:22.746 --> 35:25.738
Yes. Scorpius.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.327
( growls )

35:28.419 --> 35:30.080
(whimpering)

35:30.170 --> 35:32.252
Arachnid.

35:32.339 --> 35:34.079
Kill it?

35:35.301 --> 35:37.417
Yes. Scorpius.

35:37.511 --> 35:39.718
It's time to kill it.

35:40.681 --> 35:42.637
(Sikozu shrieks)

35:43.726 --> 35:45.307
Help.

36:02.536 --> 36:04.151
(gasps )

36:04.246 --> 36:06.737
What's your hurry, old one?

36:06.832 --> 36:08.333
Keep away from me.

36:08.417 --> 36:09.873
I don't want you.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.201
You're old and bitter.

36:12.296 --> 36:13.832
You know who I do want.
Where is he?

36:13.922 --> 36:15.048
I don't know anything.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.544
Liar! You know where he is.

36:17.634 --> 36:20.341
Scorpius.

36:20.429 --> 36:23.136
Tell me or you die.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.885
If I don't tell you, you die.

36:25.976 --> 36:29.218
You need his energy when
you're starving, and you
can't find him.

36:29.313 --> 36:30.723
Come!

36:37.363 --> 36:39.399
I sense him.

36:39.948 --> 36:42.234
Close.

36:42.326 --> 36:45.363
(Scorpius growling )

36:48.207 --> 36:50.698
(growling)

36:52.252 --> 36:53.867
( guttural growl )

36:53.962 --> 36:55.338
( snarling )

36:56.382 --> 36:57.246
( snarling )

36:57.341 --> 36:59.753
( screaming )

37:04.306 --> 37:05.512
Crichton...

37:05.599 --> 37:09.217
The arachnid is harvesting
Scorpius.

37:09.311 --> 37:11.393
Stay with 'em if you can.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.324
(gasping)

37:39.216 --> 37:40.456
Foundit

37:40.551 --> 37:43.634
Tier Seven, in Cargo Bay.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.006
I'm never gonna make it.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.635
(grunting)

38:23.051 --> 38:25.212
I know you can see me.

38:26.305 --> 38:28.591
Bad guys always see me.

38:28.682 --> 38:31.264
'Cause my plans suck.

38:31.894 --> 38:34.010
People die.

38:34.104 --> 38:36.186
It's always a mess.

38:36.273 --> 38:38.480
Talika:
Crichton.

38:40.569 --> 38:43.185
Yeah, that's me.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.191
Dumb ass.

38:45.282 --> 38:47.739
I help someone and
they screw me.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.317
I have no remorse.

38:50.412 --> 38:52.494
You are food, and | eat.

38:52.581 --> 38:55.789
There's always an excuse, lady.

38:55.876 --> 38:59.334
Are the others coming to...
attack?

39:00.714 --> 39:03.672
Oh, I don't...
ldon't think so.

39:03.759 --> 39:07.217
It's just... you and me.

39:08.472 --> 39:11.555
l was planning on...

39:11.642 --> 39:16.136
grabbing those 'nads there, but
I guess you're not gonna let
me do that, are you?

39:19.274 --> 39:22.983
I'm tired of this.

39:23.070 --> 39:25.026
Why don't we just...

39:25.113 --> 39:26.148
end it?

39:26.240 --> 39:28.196
(sighing ):
Come on. I'm...

39:28.283 --> 39:30.535
I'm tired. I'm tired
of worrying.

39:30.619 --> 39:33.406
I'm tired of fighting. Just...

39:34.248 --> 39:37.115
bring it on. End it now.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.871
Do you want me to kill you?

39:39.962 --> 39:41.793
Yes, please.

39:42.422 --> 39:44.708
Fast. Slow.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.086
Lady's choice.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.963
I like it slow.

39:52.099 --> 39:55.057
Oh, God, I was afraid you
were gonna say that.

39:55.143 --> 39:56.553
Bring it on.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.101
I already have.

40:01.358 --> 40:03.474
Crichton, don't let her!

40:05.404 --> 40:07.440
( screaming )

40:09.324 --> 40:11.064
( screeching )

40:11.159 --> 40:12.695
(hissing)

40:12.786 --> 40:14.367
Whoa. Freaky.

40:14.454 --> 40:16.410
(hissing)

40:17.332 --> 40:18.788
Get the orbs!

40:20.502 --> 40:22.242
(hissing)

40:25.173 --> 40:26.333
Crichton:
Hurry it up!

40:26.425 --> 40:28.381
Can't hold her off
much longer...

40:28.468 --> 40:29.844
(grunts)

40:33.265 --> 40:34.380
(grunts)

40:47.362 --> 40:49.444
(panting)

40:50.907 --> 40:54.195
Along came a spider.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.527
Exploded beside her.

41:03.837 --> 41:06.249
Rygel:
Oh, excellent, Noranti.

41:06.340 --> 41:09.002
Best roasted spider soup
I ever ate.

41:09.092 --> 41:12.129
It's the only spider soup I
ever ate, but it's really
quite good.

41:12.220 --> 41:14.836
Are you feeling like your
old selves again?

41:14.931 --> 41:16.387
Hey!

41:17.726 --> 41:20.308
Rygel obviously is.

41:20.395 --> 41:23.387
How about you? Still affected?

41:23.482 --> 41:25.473
You don't seem very angry.

41:25.567 --> 41:26.852
( chuckles )

41:26.943 --> 41:30.652
Would you like me to show you
how angry I am?

41:32.449 --> 41:34.155
Sikozu:
What is worse?

41:34.242 --> 41:40.203
Having us see that you are
half-Scarran, or remembering
it yourself?

41:41.333 --> 41:43.289
(sighs)

41:43.377 --> 41:47.120
I know what I am, Sikozu.

41:47.214 --> 41:52.254
This incident was simply
a fortuitous, though
troubling, reminder.

41:54.137 --> 42:01.600
If you want my help, the price
is inclusion and honesty.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.870
Do you have any idea what
you've done?

42:25.085 --> 42:26.621
You won the coin toss.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.668
But we lost, didn't we?

42:28.755 --> 42:31.337
Aeryn, it's over.

42:31.425 --> 42:35.509
So your mind is now so full of
this dren that you can't even
see straight. Is that it?

42:35.595 --> 42:37.256
Move on, Aeryn.

42:37.347 --> 42:39.178
You see, I did everything...

42:39.266 --> 42:41.222
everything I could to
keep us together.

42:41.309 --> 42:44.267
I did exactly what you told me
to do and the whole time,
you have been cheating.

42:44.354 --> 42:47.187
Yeah, I'm a coward. Move on.
It's over.

42:47.274 --> 42:49.060
No, I'm gonna tell you how
this gonna go from now.

42:49.151 --> 42:51.062
You are gonna stop
sniffing this dren.

42:51.153 --> 42:52.859
Shut up!
-Don't you tell me to shut up.

42:52.946 --> 42:56.063
Pilot! My Comms are a bit
buggy. Can you test the
system, please?

42:56.158 --> 43:00.492
Yes, Commander, but that will
take all Comms off-line for
about 30 microts.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.740
I thought so. That'll be fine.
Thank you.

43:02.831 --> 43:04.492
Shut up and listen to me.

43:04.583 --> 43:10.374
Scorpius is here, looking
for the key to what is
inside my head.

43:10.464 --> 43:13.797
The neural chips, Aurora Chair,
threatening Earth.

43:13.884 --> 43:16.170
None of it works because he
does not understand me.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.547
Stop using him as an excuse...
-Please!

43:22.601 --> 43:24.762
You're the key.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.560
My Achilles.

43:27.647 --> 43:29.262
You.

43:29.357 --> 43:34.021
If he figures that out, the
world and all that's
in it is nothing.

43:34.112 --> 43:39.732
He will use you and the baby
and I will not be able
to stop him.

43:41.328 --> 43:44.115
So you think he's been
using the Comms?

43:45.832 --> 43:48.073
Look what it's done to you.

43:48.168 --> 43:50.409
You're completely paranoid.

43:52.380 --> 43:55.463
Scorpius (over Comms ):
Pilot, are we having a problem
with the Comms?

43:55.550 --> 43:57.632
Pilot:
l was just checking them.

43:57.719 --> 44:02.634
Some slight irregularities,
but they appear to be
functioning normally.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.056
So, it's over?

44:15.320 --> 44:17.857
It's over.

44:19.616 --> 44:22.574
There's nothing more
between us?

44:27.040 --> 44:28.780
Nothing.
