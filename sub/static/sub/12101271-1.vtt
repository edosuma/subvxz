00:29.029 --> 00:30.726
BTC, Your pole is go?

00:30.769 --> 00:32.075
Is that affirmative?

00:32.119 --> 00:33.076
It is affirmative.

00:33.120 --> 00:33.990
BTC, is a go.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.731
Copy that, OPS?

00:35.774 --> 00:36.645
We're a go.

00:36.688 --> 00:37.515
Electrical?

00:37.559 --> 00:38.255
Go.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.822
SRO?

00:39.865 --> 00:41.606
SRO is go, we
are clear to launch.

00:41.650 --> 00:42.520
Guidance?

00:42.564 --> 00:43.304
Go flight.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.522
Tito?

00:44.566 --> 00:45.567
Kingfisher
is ready to launch.

00:45.610 --> 00:46.437
And CDR?

00:46.481 --> 00:47.612
CDR is go.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.092
Okay, Commander Barnett,

00:49.136 --> 00:50.833
on behalf of the Hyperion team

00:50.876 --> 00:52.052
and the millions of people
watching around the world,

00:52.095 --> 00:53.792
good luck, God speed,

00:53.836 --> 00:56.839
and we'll see you back
here in two years.

00:56.882 --> 00:57.970
- Thank you, Jim.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.537
Our thanks to the launch team

00:59.581 --> 01:00.886
and everyone at the MTS program.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.106
The crew is go for launch.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.412
Copy that.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.762
We have a go for
auto-sequence start.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.198
T-minus 15 seconds.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.635
Stand by for terminal count.

01:12.898 --> 01:13.899
Ten,

01:13.943 --> 01:14.683
nine,

01:14.726 --> 01:15.466
eight,

01:15.510 --> 01:16.250
seven,

01:16.293 --> 01:17.294
six.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.905
We have main engine start.

01:19.949 --> 01:20.689
Three,

01:20.732 --> 01:21.472
two,

01:21.516 --> 01:22.212
one,

01:22.256 --> 01:23.387
zero.

01:39.664 --> 01:43.059
First-stage separation
in three, two, one.

01:45.235 --> 01:46.106
Good break.

01:57.595 --> 01:58.727
Roger roll MTS.

02:12.915 --> 02:15.265
We should have a good
forward link now, MTS.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.746
- Copy that, I'm seeing
the same thing here.

02:21.663 --> 02:22.707
We're coming up

02:22.751 --> 02:23.795
on second-stage separation.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.536
- Copy, second-stage separation.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.938
Altitude
is 70 kilometers.

02:35.981 --> 02:38.114
170 kilometers downrange.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.038
- Hyperion, the main engines
are underperforming slightly.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.345
Copy, main
engines underperforming.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.911
- Good read.

02:52.955 --> 02:53.869
Stand by,
we're consulting flight.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.962
- Flip your visors down.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.667
We're past return to landing.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.843
Abort complete reaching
the end of Oceanic, abort?

03:21.070 --> 03:21.853
Hyperion?

03:24.465 --> 03:26.031
That's a
negative abort, MTS.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.946
There's enough fuel to
handle the discrepancy.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.687
Negative abort.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.907
- Copy, negative abort.

03:36.912 --> 03:37.782
MTS, you're leaving

03:37.826 --> 03:38.957
for Mars Transfer Orbit.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.872
Final systems nominal check.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.963
- Are we a go?

03:45.007 --> 03:46.443
- Go.

03:46.487 --> 03:47.270
- Go.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.405
- Roger, Hyperion, we're ready.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.145
Go for MTO burn.

03:53.189 --> 03:55.017
Roger that,
enjoy the ride, everyone.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.497
MTO in three,

03:56.540 --> 03:57.541
two,

03:57.585 --> 03:58.977
one.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.212
That's negative return, MTS.

04:25.613 --> 04:26.483
Past max Q.

04:35.187 --> 04:38.190
Main engine cut-off
three, two, one.

04:39.931 --> 04:40.715
- We go.

05:55.659 --> 05:56.747
There she is.

06:13.634 --> 06:14.678
MTS,
we're approaching

06:14.722 --> 06:16.071
Kingfisher separation.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.681
- Copy, Kingfisher separation.

06:25.472 --> 06:28.388
Separation is nominal.

06:43.272 --> 06:44.665
The
Kingfisher is auto-docked

06:44.708 --> 06:45.709
to the MTS.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.537
I'm moving to taxi in now.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.452
Copy that.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.122
must
occur in closure rate.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.210
Closure rate is nominal,

07:08.253 --> 07:09.951
five centimeters per minute.

07:17.393 --> 07:18.960
MTS in free-drift.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.225
Hang tight a bit.

07:26.315 --> 07:27.751
Tethered gravity is starting.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.710
You're a go, Hyperion.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.506
Artificial gravity is climbing.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.774
Looks like we'll hit
close to five Gs.

07:56.867 --> 08:00.175
Tether's unspooling.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.469
Solar array separation.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.397
TDS nominal and at full speed.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.663
All right, plugs out.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.186
Impeccable
work as usual.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.319
- Thank you for the Launch, Jim.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.712
See you again at
the first check.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.496
- Are you kidding me?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.107
That was incredible, that
was incredible!

09:06.067 --> 09:07.198
How are you feeling?

09:07.242 --> 09:09.113
- I'm Good, good.

09:36.053 --> 09:36.967
- Let's go.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.594
- Got it.

09:54.637 --> 09:55.420
- Thanks.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.550
- All right, okay Zoe,
you take this one.

10:38.594 --> 10:39.987
David, you start
working in the back.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.553
- This one?
- Yeah.

11:19.374 --> 11:20.505
- I'll be in the last wing.

11:20.549 --> 11:21.332
- Copy that.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.263
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.091
- How are you feeling?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.965
You need anything?

11:45.008 --> 11:45.748
- I'll be all right.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.184
- A beer?

11:47.228 --> 11:48.359
- So thoughtful.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.202
- This will help.

13:32.246 --> 13:33.464
- Thanks, Zo.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.879
Come on, Zo.
- What?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.620
- Really?
- What are you?

13:58.663 --> 14:00.361
I'm not.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.189
- Commander, how did she
get Payloads to allow this?

14:02.232 --> 14:04.669
- I don't even know anybody
at Payloads so how will I--

14:04.713 --> 14:07.672
- You wasted what?

14:07.716 --> 14:12.025
800 grams of your allowable,
personal effects on these?

14:12.068 --> 14:13.635
You don't even care
about the rival.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.812
- No, but you do
David.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.509
I don't know, it's so easy.

14:19.771 --> 14:20.860
- Okay,

14:22.426 --> 14:23.558
five hours down

14:24.646 --> 14:26.213
two years ago.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.217
- As your doctor, I'm
telling you to drink that.

14:41.010 --> 14:41.837
Applicable?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.708
Applicable?

14:43.752 --> 14:44.579
- Applicable is British.

14:44.622 --> 14:45.580
- Is it?

14:45.623 --> 14:46.755
- How do I look?

14:46.798 --> 14:48.235
- Stunning.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.932
- Look, I'm serious,
this is a big deal.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.194
- You look good.

14:51.238 --> 14:55.590
You look fine,
seriously, you're good.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.636
- Yes we do, we read
you loud and clear.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.595
Welcome to MTS-42.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.645
Oh yeah, we did.

15:07.689 --> 15:10.126
It's not uncommon to experience
a few hiccups during launch,

15:10.170 --> 15:14.130
but due to the preparation
and thanks to our ground team,

15:14.174 --> 15:17.481
we had a smooth rendezvous
with the MTS Cycler.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.140
That's true.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.056
It's bittersweet.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.624
I've had the honor
of participating in
two missions to date

15:29.667 --> 15:32.322
and I couldn't be working
with a more talented crew

15:32.366 --> 15:34.934
on this, my final
and third mission.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.548
- Well it's only
been a few hours,

15:40.591 --> 15:42.898
but it's already a
life-changing experience.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.639
I'm thrilled to be here.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.776
To be honest, this isn't where
I thought I would end up.

15:51.820 --> 15:55.084
To me, my career was gonna
be researched on Earth.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.739
I guess you never know
where life's gonna take you.

15:59.523 --> 16:01.090
Yes, I applied to
the HARP program

16:01.134 --> 16:02.613
because I thought it
would be a funny story

16:02.657 --> 16:05.007
to be rejected by Hyperion.

16:05.051 --> 16:09.011
But now I realized this is one
of those rare opportunities

16:09.055 --> 16:12.058
that could truly give my
life meaning beyond anything

16:12.101 --> 16:13.581
I could imagine.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.673
Well, space exploration
has always led

16:18.716 --> 16:20.196
to amazing medical discoveries

16:20.240 --> 16:22.590
that are applicable to
the people on Earth.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.727
- The launch was incredible.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.903
It does take a little while

16:31.947 --> 16:34.167
to get adjusted to the
artificial gravity.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.827
Two years is a long time
to be away from my wife,

16:42.871 --> 16:45.700
but this is a once-in-a
lifetime opportunity.

16:45.743 --> 16:48.094
I'm so grateful to
have her support.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.315
My research is
integral to maintaining

16:52.359 --> 16:54.317
and sustaining life
on Mars long term.

16:54.361 --> 16:58.408
We are taking the first steps
to being able to call Mars

16:58.452 --> 16:59.714
a second home.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.197
- No, no, not at all.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.243
Out of the thousands
of proposals submitted

17:07.287 --> 17:09.985
from university
students and professors

17:10.029 --> 17:13.032
all around the world, these
two definitely rose to the top.

17:13.075 --> 17:16.861
I'm more than confident in their
ability and their training.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.734
I know they can handle
anything that comes their way.

18:23.058 --> 18:23.841
Oh shit!

18:30.979 --> 18:31.632
Oh Shit!

18:43.948 --> 18:45.080
- Commander!

18:45.124 --> 18:47.213
- Holy shot?
- Are you okay?

18:47.256 --> 18:49.302
- Get him off, get him off.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.130
Get him off.
- Are you okay.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.044
- Is he alive?
- Just pull him off.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.438
- Get him off, get him off.

18:55.482 --> 18:58.789
- Stop, let's get
him to the infirmary.

18:58.833 --> 19:03.794
- I got him!
- Ready? One, two, three!

19:19.375 --> 19:21.856
- Who the hell is this?
- Come on.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.835
David, put some gloves on.

19:44.879 --> 19:45.662
- Copy.

19:58.936 --> 20:01.112
- Hold that closed, just
hold it as closed as you can.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.158
- Wow.
- That's great.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.336
- The damage is contained
to the functional module,

20:07.380 --> 20:09.991
a significant amount
of atmospheric O-2

20:10.034 --> 20:11.819
has entered from the MTS.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.299
There's a breach in the hole.

20:13.342 --> 20:14.604
You're getting all this?

20:15.431 --> 20:16.867
Good.

20:16.911 --> 20:20.001
Hey, Jim, who the
fuck is on my ship?

20:22.351 --> 20:26.050
Yeah, he's still unconscious
but I mean, is he a threat?

20:26.094 --> 20:29.924
Do we need to, I don't know,
find a way to restrain him or,

20:41.762 --> 20:43.024
- Any idea if he'll wake up?

20:44.286 --> 20:46.245
- Honestly, I'm
surprise yourself alive.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.301
- His name is Michael Adams.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.651
All they know for now is
that he's launch support.

21:02.957 --> 21:04.393
- How the hell was he missed?

21:04.437 --> 21:06.265
- They looking into it.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.962
- We don't make
mistakes like this.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.616
- Did he stow away on purpose?

21:09.659 --> 21:11.052
- Hyperion doesn't
know that yet.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.928
- How are you not screaming
in pain right now?

21:19.234 --> 21:21.976
- It hurts.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.152
- This is pretty serious.

21:25.371 --> 21:26.372
- How long?

21:27.416 --> 21:29.549
- To be safe, six
weeks at least.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.429
- CO-2 is up 3%.

21:40.473 --> 21:41.778
- How?

21:41.822 --> 21:43.432
- The CDR array is turned off.

21:43.476 --> 21:45.216
We shut down the entire
functional module,

21:45.260 --> 21:46.957
including life support.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.133
Let's get started on the
lithium hydroxide canisters.

21:49.177 --> 21:50.004
- Roger.

22:02.233 --> 22:03.800
- The breathing masks
in the exercise room

22:03.844 --> 22:05.846
are attached to
the CDRA as well.

22:05.889 --> 22:09.937
So let's just hold
off on exercise till
we sorted this out.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.939
- Copy.
- Copy that, Commander.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.078
- We're good to go.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.106
- Oh fuck.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.643
- Hey, sit down.
- Did we take off?

24:30.686 --> 24:32.166
- No, hey sit down.
- Did we take off?

24:32.209 --> 24:33.820
Sit down or you're
gonna pass out.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.518
Hey, you're okay,
just listen to me.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.302
You're fine, you're safe.

24:38.346 --> 24:41.262
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- You're safe, Commander!

24:41.305 --> 24:42.306
- Did we take off?
- Commander.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.960
- Did we take off?

24:46.572 --> 24:47.529
- Okay, let's take
some deep breaths,

24:47.573 --> 24:49.096
take some deep breaths.

24:49.139 --> 24:50.837
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.186
Just like I'm doing.

24:52.229 --> 24:53.317
Great, Michael,
it's Michael, right?

24:53.361 --> 24:55.015
Micheal, I'm Zoe, I'm a doctor.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.973
I want you to focus on
slowing down your breathing.

24:57.017 --> 24:58.714
Just nice and slow, okay?

24:58.758 --> 25:00.237
I'm gonna check your stitches.

25:00.281 --> 25:02.065
Is that okay?
- Stitches?

25:02.109 --> 25:03.371
- Just nice and slow, you got
injured during the launch,

25:03.414 --> 25:04.677
just on your side here.

25:04.720 --> 25:05.895
Is that okay?

25:05.939 --> 25:06.722
Let's take a look.

25:06.766 --> 25:07.549
Ready?

25:07.593 --> 25:10.683
Okay, okay.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.162
That's great.

25:13.381 --> 25:15.557
Okay, you're good, you're good.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.562
Nice and slow, slow your
heart rate down, okay?

25:20.606 --> 25:21.737
- Yeah, okay.

25:24.174 --> 25:25.611
Sorry.
- No, you're okay.

25:25.654 --> 25:27.569
- Hi Michael, I'm
Marina Barnett.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.310
I'm the commander of the ship.

25:29.353 --> 25:31.399
Do you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

25:32.618 --> 25:34.228
- No, I don't mind.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.579
- Do you work for Hyperion?

25:37.623 --> 25:38.928
- Yes.

25:38.972 --> 25:42.366
I'm a launch support
engineer, ma'am.

25:42.410 --> 25:46.283
- Okay, and do you remember
what happened on the pad?

25:55.031 --> 25:56.903
- Yes I was, arming the

25:56.946 --> 25:59.601
second stage firing pins and

25:59.645 --> 26:04.650
I thought I was
buckled in and no--

26:05.651 --> 26:07.087
- You've had a concussion,
this is normal, this is fine.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.089
- I thought I was
clipped in, yeah okay.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.395
- It's okay if you
don't remember.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.269
- How long was I?

26:15.312 --> 26:16.313
How long was I out?

26:19.012 --> 26:20.579
- We took off
about 12 hours ago.

26:23.364 --> 26:24.191
- 12 hours?

26:27.673 --> 26:29.239
- I need to get
back to my sister.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.589
I need to get back
to my sister, please.

26:30.632 --> 26:31.894
My sister, she is alone, please.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.722
I gotta get back, please.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.289
- Micheal I hear you, Micheal.
But we're not going back.

26:35.332 --> 26:36.725
- What do you mean we
are not going back?

26:36.769 --> 26:38.553
This is a two-year
mission, please, please.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.207
- I understand, I understand--

26:40.250 --> 26:42.339
- Micheal.
- We're moving too fast.

26:42.383 --> 26:44.428
We don't have enough
fuel to turn around.

26:44.472 --> 26:45.647
- I gotta get back home.

26:45.691 --> 26:46.953
- I understand, I do.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.694
Let me go and relay
this Hyperion.

26:48.737 --> 26:49.782
I'm just gonna be a
few minutes, okay?

26:49.825 --> 26:51.784
I'll be right back, okay?

26:51.827 --> 26:53.873
- Stay here.
-  Yes, Commander.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.875
- We're gonna figure
this out, okay?

26:55.918 --> 26:58.529
I just need you to
keep breathing while
we figure it out.

26:58.573 --> 26:59.705
Can you just do that?

26:59.748 --> 27:01.358
Slow everything back down.

27:13.022 --> 27:15.372
He's stable, he just needs
some time alone to rest

27:15.416 --> 27:16.983
and process everything.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.159
- Copy.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.379
- Do you need a hand.

27:22.423 --> 27:23.206
- No, I'm fine.

28:11.559 --> 28:12.299
- Michael.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.517
Hey.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.128
- Let me give you a hand.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.956
I'm good.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.348
- You okay?

28:18.392 --> 28:19.436
- Sit here.

28:21.612 --> 28:22.744
- Good?
- Yeah.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.050
I'm good thanks.

28:24.093 --> 28:25.225
- Yeah.
- Yes.

28:27.227 --> 28:29.359
- So Michael, Hyperion
talked to your sister,

28:29.403 --> 28:30.883
she's she's okay.

28:30.926 --> 28:33.233
We're gonna be hiring
her a full-time guardian

28:33.276 --> 28:35.061
and covering every expense.

28:37.411 --> 28:38.151
- Thank you.

28:39.021 --> 28:40.806
- These are yours.

28:40.849 --> 28:43.069
The mission director wants
to give you some more details

28:43.112 --> 28:45.158
when we're up for live
comm tomorrow, so.

28:48.204 --> 28:48.988
- Okay.

28:50.511 --> 28:51.642
Thank you.

28:53.383 --> 28:55.646
I actually came down here
cause I had a couple of things

28:55.690 --> 28:56.822
that I wanted to say.

28:59.085 --> 28:59.912
Do you mind?

28:59.955 --> 29:01.478
- No, please.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.092
- First off, I just
want to apologize

29:06.135 --> 29:08.790
for that freak-out
I had back there,

29:08.834 --> 29:13.795
it was just kind of a
shock to wake up here.

29:17.843 --> 29:20.367
Thank you.
- Of course.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.110
- Also, I'm not gonna
just sit around.

29:25.459 --> 29:26.895
I know the ship is small

29:26.939 --> 29:28.592
and it's a lot smaller
now that I'm here

29:28.636 --> 29:30.594
and I'm sure there's some
grunt work to be done

29:30.638 --> 29:31.813
and I can learn fast.

29:31.857 --> 29:36.209
I can do whatever it takes.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.298
- Thank you, Michael,
I appreciate that.

29:39.647 --> 29:41.736
We're waiting on Hyperion
to tell us what to do next,

29:41.780 --> 29:45.827
but, in the meantime
if you're up to it,

29:45.871 --> 29:48.787
perhaps, Zoe we can run you
through the safety procedures.

29:48.830 --> 29:49.657
- Yeah.

29:54.227 --> 29:57.621
We're sorry that you
missed the filet mignon,

29:57.665 --> 30:00.842
but, this is the
next best thing.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.583
We think it's spaghetti.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.107
- I should warn you now that

30:05.151 --> 30:07.588
Zoe thinks she's the
in-flight entertainment.

30:07.631 --> 30:08.632
- Understood.

30:08.676 --> 30:11.505
- You're David Kim, right?

30:11.548 --> 30:13.072
- Just David's fine.

30:13.115 --> 30:15.857
- Got it, so you're in school?

30:15.901 --> 30:18.860
- Yeah, working on my masters
in instructional engineering.

30:18.904 --> 30:21.689
- Were you working
on proposal for HARP?

30:21.732 --> 30:23.256
- I actually planned on
putting something together

30:23.299 --> 30:24.344
for the next mission.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.565
- I'm not sure you
need to apply anymore.

30:31.046 --> 30:33.135
- Yeah, I guess not.

30:36.225 --> 30:38.488
- Cheers, welcome to MTS-42.

30:38.532 --> 30:39.968
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.840
- Cheers.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.587
I don't know, it
really doesn't feel like

30:50.631 --> 30:51.980
he's here on purpose.

30:52.024 --> 30:56.332
Agreed,
so what do we do?

30:56.376 --> 30:57.812
- I think you should keep busy.

30:59.683 --> 31:01.468
- I don't think I
have anything for you.

31:05.385 --> 31:08.127
- Maybe I could have him
do some data entry for me.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.086
Actually, that should be
nice to have some company.

31:13.088 --> 31:13.959
- Yeah, that works.

31:20.530 --> 31:21.314
- What?

31:23.925 --> 31:26.580
- You're gonna have to share
credit on whatever you publish.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.931
- It's not about
the credits, Zo.

31:29.975 --> 31:33.239
- Okay, well, you're a better
person than I am, David Kim.

31:33.282 --> 31:34.501
- That's for sure.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.461
- Okay, that's the plan then?

31:38.505 --> 31:40.072
- It's a plan.
- All right.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.427
- Try not to snore
too loud tonight

31:48.645 --> 31:49.777
- For the night, when
the lights are dimmed,

31:49.820 --> 31:50.996
they have to stay dimmed.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.911
It's a par consumption thing.

31:52.954 --> 31:55.261
And if there's a catastrophic
failure in a single module,

31:55.304 --> 31:57.741
like fire or rapid,
depressurization,
watch your head,

31:57.785 --> 31:59.961
you have to close this hatch.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.310
So bye-bye David.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.140
This is the magnetic
radiation proofing.

32:05.184 --> 32:07.926
In case there's a solar
storm, come in here.

32:09.753 --> 32:11.668
I realize your first visit
was a little intense,

32:11.712 --> 32:15.194
but this happens to be my
favorite spot on the ship.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.300
- Wow, pictures
don't do it justice.

32:34.343 --> 32:35.475
- No, not at all.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.403
What's your sister's name?

32:52.231 --> 32:53.014
- Ava.

33:00.761 --> 33:03.894
- And it's just the two of you?

33:03.938 --> 33:04.721
- Yeah.

34:08.176 --> 34:11.397
- Okay, well, this is batch 62.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.659
- Batch 62.

34:12.702 --> 34:14.878
- And we'll start with row four.

34:14.922 --> 34:18.534
- Row four.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.710
- Row four A will be

34:22.669 --> 34:24.279
10.23.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.155
Section B.

34:34.942 --> 34:35.725
What?

34:36.944 --> 34:38.424
- I'm sorry.

34:38.467 --> 34:39.773
I've gotta ask?

34:41.818 --> 34:43.342
What is this?

34:43.385 --> 34:44.952
What are we listening to?

34:44.995 --> 34:46.867
- Like you don't
listen to jazz at all?

34:46.910 --> 34:49.087
- No, I mean not really.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.437
- Actually my wife is the
one that got me into jazz,

34:51.480 --> 34:53.526
but now I love it.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.097
Section B is 2.16.

35:02.187 --> 35:02.970
- 2.16.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.104
- Yeah, research can get a
little bit monotonous at times.

35:06.147 --> 35:09.455
Especially phycology,
but these guys,

35:09.498 --> 35:11.457
they keep me on my toes.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.937
Sanders, Coltrane, Bird.

35:16.244 --> 35:17.985
- They're like
basketball players or--

35:18.028 --> 35:19.291
- Yeah, the basketball players.

35:19.334 --> 35:20.814
No, they're not
basketball players.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.468
These guys are the jazz
legends of the 60s.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.034
- Right, I knew that.

35:24.078 --> 35:27.908
- There, you hear how
it's unpredictable?

35:27.951 --> 35:29.692
But it still has rules.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.868
That generally playing
together, but once in a while,

35:31.912 --> 35:34.610
a player or two will drift off
into their own little groove.

35:36.090 --> 35:41.095
There, you hear.

35:42.183 --> 35:43.532
- No, I don't.

35:43.576 --> 35:46.100
It sounds like a hot mess.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.885
- Well that's what I like
about it, it's not obvious.

35:50.757 --> 35:54.195
And sometimes, it can be
a little bit unpleasant,

35:55.675 --> 35:56.937
but it's pure expression,

35:58.634 --> 36:00.070
and it usually finds a balance.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.203
- Nice, I can dig that.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.120
- Good.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.079
Section C 9.86.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.075
How's it looking in there?

36:48.118 --> 36:50.164
- The whole left
side came loose.

36:51.731 --> 36:53.950
- There, remove the cover.

36:53.994 --> 36:54.603
Roger.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.179
- Carefully.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.006
- Copy.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.405
Oh, shit.
-  What?

37:13.448 --> 37:16.190
- There must have been a short.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.324
Is it looking bad?

37:19.367 --> 37:23.676
- Yeah, the whole
thing is charred.

37:23.719 --> 37:25.243
- Take another picture.

37:49.179 --> 37:50.398
- Are we all set?

37:55.055 --> 37:56.752
- Hyperion, this
is MTS, come in.

38:03.629 --> 38:06.109
Yes, we have a damaged
life support assembly.

38:06.153 --> 38:09.069
I need to inspect the
incoming images of the CDRA.

38:12.681 --> 38:15.554
It's critical that this gets
fixed, Jim, mission critical.

38:17.686 --> 38:19.079
Yep, going off COMM.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.967
- David, can I speak to you?

38:38.011 --> 38:39.578
- Of course.

38:39.621 --> 38:41.144
- And Michael, can you
please put on David's suit?

38:41.188 --> 38:42.668
Zoe will explain what
she needs you to do.

38:42.711 --> 38:43.973
- Yeah, sure, of course.

39:16.223 --> 39:17.529
- Yes Commander?

39:20.619 --> 39:23.926
- How much O2 does
your rack produce?

39:23.970 --> 39:27.713
- I mean, 90 liters a day,
just a negligible amount.

39:27.756 --> 39:30.019
- Is there any way you
can get it up to 950?

39:30.063 --> 39:31.151
- 950?
- Yeah.

39:31.194 --> 39:33.849
- No, not with microgreens.

39:33.893 --> 39:35.938
We're testing fluid production
here, non scrubbing CO2.

39:35.982 --> 39:38.027
- Yeah, I thought that's
what your research was about.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.420
- Yeah, nut that's with algae

39:39.464 --> 39:41.422
and that can only
be opened on Mars.

39:41.466 --> 39:44.033
- Well, how much oxygen
would your algae produce?

39:46.645 --> 39:47.646
- Approximately...

39:49.691 --> 39:51.301
I could come close to
what you're looking for

39:51.345 --> 39:53.042
under the right conditions.

39:53.086 --> 39:54.783
But all the gear I'd need
was already flown to Mars

39:54.827 --> 39:56.176
on the last unmanned.

39:57.569 --> 40:00.528
What are we up against here?

40:01.616 --> 40:02.965
Did we lose the CDRA?

40:04.010 --> 40:06.969
- We don't know for sure yet.

40:08.928 --> 40:13.323
- Okay, what about
the backup canisters?

40:13.367 --> 40:14.281
- We don't have enough.

40:16.805 --> 40:19.460
Shit, is there anything
else you can try?

40:19.504 --> 40:21.419
- I could try growing them here,

40:21.462 --> 40:25.553
but we would risk ruining
the entire culture.

40:25.597 --> 40:27.250
All right.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.473
Okay, if I use half of the algae

40:32.517 --> 40:33.909
it could probably
still leave me enough

40:33.953 --> 40:35.345
for a first starter
culture on Mars.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.521
- Okay, good, well, just
put everything else aside

40:36.564 --> 40:38.218
and focus on that.

40:38.261 --> 40:39.785
- Yes Commander.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.830
I need a little bit to
figure everything out.

40:41.874 --> 40:46.008
- Oka, copy.

40:46.052 --> 40:49.447
- Oh, David, Zoe and Michael
are removing the CDRA.

40:49.490 --> 40:51.274
They don't need
to know this yet.

40:58.673 --> 40:59.544
- COMM check.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.459
- Yeah, I can hear you.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.636
No, when I say COMM check
you say, good check.

41:04.679 --> 41:06.202
- Okay.

41:06.246 --> 41:07.421
- COMM check.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.947
- I'm gonna depressurize
the antechamber.

41:17.692 --> 41:19.651
When we get in there,
everything's normal.

41:19.694 --> 41:21.304
There's gonna be no air,

41:21.348 --> 41:23.350
but everything's gonna be
normal other than that.

41:23.393 --> 41:25.134
No floating around just...

41:26.048 --> 41:27.528
- Yeah, yeah I'm good--

41:27.572 --> 41:28.311
- You're just reading
instructions, okay?

41:28.355 --> 41:32.620
- No worry.

41:58.211 --> 42:00.561
- What's first?

42:00.605 --> 42:03.869
- You've got to unscrew
the absorbent bed.

42:03.912 --> 42:06.480
It's those screws
on the other side.

42:37.163 --> 42:40.122
So what does this thing do?

42:40.166 --> 42:42.472
- It scrubs the carbon
dioxide out of the air.

42:42.516 --> 42:43.691
You take that.

42:57.923 --> 43:00.447
Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

43:00.490 --> 43:01.579
- Here we go.

43:03.885 --> 43:07.019
Be careful with that,
very very careful.

43:07.062 --> 43:07.802
Okay

43:19.553 --> 43:21.903
I will never get used
to how little materials

43:21.947 --> 43:24.645
is between us and space.

43:24.689 --> 43:26.516
- That I know.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.040
When they started adding
a third passenger,

43:28.083 --> 43:29.824
to make up for the weight,

43:29.868 --> 43:31.609
they made the functional
module almost half the size

43:31.652 --> 43:34.002
and removed a protective
layer of shielding.

43:35.134 --> 43:36.875
- Hey, that's not helpful.

43:36.918 --> 43:38.224
- Just facts.

43:38.267 --> 43:39.573
- That's not a
helpful thing to say.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.487
- Just facts.

43:44.665 --> 43:46.232
- Oh I'll take that.

43:47.494 --> 43:50.453
- You guys okay?
-  Yeah.

43:58.810 --> 43:59.593
- Micheal?

44:00.725 --> 44:01.856
- Oh

44:04.032 --> 44:04.946
- Ah, shit.

44:12.432 --> 44:13.302
You got it?

44:15.740 --> 44:16.610
Yeah, that's great.

44:22.616 --> 44:24.792
Okay, a little pinch here.

44:31.581 --> 44:32.452
- Thanks.

44:33.496 --> 44:34.759
- It's literally my job.

44:34.802 --> 44:36.238
- Not just for
this, I mean like,

44:36.282 --> 44:37.675
you've just kinda
gone out of your way

44:37.718 --> 44:38.980
to make me feel welcome.

44:39.024 --> 44:40.025
- Of course.

44:43.637 --> 44:44.986
Can you take this off?

44:45.987 --> 44:47.467
- My shirt?
- Yeah.

45:00.610 --> 45:01.916
- Can you put your arm up?

45:01.960 --> 45:02.961
- Thank you.

45:36.385 --> 45:37.909
How's it coming?

45:37.952 --> 45:40.172
- We're still wrapping
up, but I'm worried.

45:41.521 --> 45:43.044
I'm worried we're only going
to be able to get to 500,

45:43.088 --> 45:45.394
maybe 550 liters a day.

45:45.438 --> 45:46.831
- Oh, no, that's good.

45:46.874 --> 45:48.702
That's literally
half of what we need.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.530
So let's go ahead and thaw
out the second batch of algae.

45:50.573 --> 45:52.793
- No, I need to rip up
the microgreens for that.

45:52.837 --> 45:54.577
- Then let's do it.

45:54.621 --> 45:55.665
- Hold on, hold on.

45:55.709 --> 45:58.581
The algae is far from thriving.

45:58.625 --> 46:01.149
It's scrubbing only a
fraction of what I could get,

46:01.193 --> 46:02.629
if I had the right equipment.

46:02.672 --> 46:04.370
Using the second
half of the batch,

46:04.413 --> 46:06.851
doesn't necessarily mean
it'll double the output.

46:09.114 --> 46:10.942
- It's imperative that we try.

46:10.985 --> 46:13.683
- Commander, this can't
be something we rely on.

46:13.727 --> 46:15.816
These batches can
die at any moment

46:15.860 --> 46:17.992
and I could lose
everything I need for Mars.

46:23.868 --> 46:28.089
Commander, this research
is years of my life.

46:28.133 --> 46:30.265
We both know how
important it is.

46:31.527 --> 46:33.660
Are we sure we want
to throw it all away

46:33.703 --> 46:36.271
while we still have a
chance to fix the CDRA.

46:45.541 --> 46:47.717
- There is no chance, David.

46:49.850 --> 46:50.633
It's gone.

46:55.551 --> 46:56.639
- Understood.

48:15.153 --> 48:17.764
- Ava, hey,

48:17.807 --> 48:19.897
I hope you're treating
at Hyperion really nicely

48:19.940 --> 48:23.683
'cause I heard that they are
putting closer the school,

48:23.726 --> 48:25.206
which is nice.

48:25.250 --> 48:26.991
Really nice.

48:27.034 --> 48:29.297
Make sure you send me some
selfies when you can, okay?

48:31.952 --> 48:33.606
I'm really getting
my groove here.

48:34.781 --> 48:36.174
You know I thought at first
I was probably gonna be

48:36.217 --> 48:39.786
a burden to crew
and everyone here,

48:39.829 --> 48:42.615
but they're actually
putting me to work.

48:44.399 --> 48:46.880
I hate that it
happened this way,

48:46.924 --> 48:50.840
but I'm thinking that this
might actually turn out

48:50.884 --> 48:54.801
to be best for me and
for us in the long run.

49:21.045 --> 49:24.439
- Correct, unfortunately, none
of the second batch survived.

49:31.707 --> 49:32.970
That was my fear.

49:38.627 --> 49:39.715
Are you sure?

49:50.683 --> 49:52.815
And why is the climb
up not an option again?

50:05.480 --> 50:07.439
Okay, you've got to
level with me, Jim.

50:12.966 --> 50:16.839
Is there any way I
can take his place?

50:16.883 --> 50:19.842
Because Hyperion can orbit
the capsule around Mars

50:19.886 --> 50:21.540
and send up a pilot
from the colony,

50:23.585 --> 50:25.239
but how do you expect me to...

50:36.598 --> 50:37.686
Okay well, I..

50:42.952 --> 50:45.477
I need you to walk me
through every option.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.305
Every single possibility.

51:11.590 --> 51:13.070
There's no easy way to say this.

51:14.854 --> 51:19.337
The carbon dioxide scrubber
is damaged permanently.

51:19.380 --> 51:22.122
The lithium hydroxide canisters
were only ever meant to be

51:22.166 --> 51:23.558
a temporary solution.

51:26.039 --> 51:28.737
We only have enough oxygen
on board for two people.

51:33.394 --> 51:35.701
I've asked David to
accelerate his research

51:35.744 --> 51:37.181
and he's managed
to get his algae

51:37.224 --> 51:38.965
produce enough for one more.

51:45.319 --> 51:46.668
- What are you saying.

51:49.932 --> 51:52.239
- We can't make it to Mar
on with Michael on board.

51:53.849 --> 51:55.547
We'll end up asphyxiating
on carbon dioxide

51:55.590 --> 51:57.984
a few weeks before we land.

51:58.854 --> 51:59.638
I mean,

52:02.206 --> 52:04.425
this ship was ever
built for two,

52:04.469 --> 52:06.166
and Hyperion started to
take a chance pushing

52:06.210 --> 52:10.214
and push it to three, but
it just can't handle four.

52:11.519 --> 52:13.565
- Okay, I've been
thinking about this

52:13.608 --> 52:16.350
and all we gotta do is get
to the colony on Mars, right?

52:16.394 --> 52:18.222
Then CO2 isn't the issue.

52:18.265 --> 52:19.658
We could just vent it out

52:19.701 --> 52:21.181
and lower the
atmospheric pressure.

52:23.096 --> 52:24.880
What we need is oxygen.

52:24.924 --> 52:29.189
We could use a pre-breathing
oxygen cylinders or water.

52:29.233 --> 52:31.670
We could just split
oxygen out of that.

52:31.713 --> 52:34.716
- We don't have enough, that
would buy him days, not months.

52:35.804 --> 52:37.893
- Maybe a resupply mission.

52:37.937 --> 52:39.373
If it was unmanned...

52:39.417 --> 52:42.202
- We're moving too
fast where we supply.

52:42.246 --> 52:45.640
The Kingfisher is the biggest
rocket they can build.

52:45.684 --> 52:47.860
- Okay, but, there's
a giant tank up there

52:47.903 --> 52:49.644
that was full of liquid
oxygen for the launch.

52:49.688 --> 52:51.342
There must be something left.

52:51.385 --> 52:52.995
- Oh there's no way
to tell from here,

52:53.039 --> 52:54.475
we can't just reel
in the tethers

52:54.519 --> 52:55.563
with the Kingfisher attached.

52:55.607 --> 52:57.696
- So we climb up and check.

52:57.739 --> 52:58.914
- Climb the tether?

52:58.958 --> 53:00.046
All the way, that's 450 meters.

53:00.089 --> 53:01.482
- It wouldn't be full gravity.

53:01.526 --> 53:03.223
- Look, Michael was on
board when we launched,

53:03.267 --> 53:05.225
so he used our extra
oxygen and fuel.

53:05.269 --> 53:07.836
We barely had enough
to make it to here.

53:09.186 --> 53:12.232
Climbing up would mean risking
damaging the solar panels,

53:12.276 --> 53:14.930
severing the power cables,
even falling off the ship.

53:14.974 --> 53:16.671
Hyperion looked into it.

53:16.715 --> 53:19.718
I can't risk both of your
lives for the possibility

53:19.761 --> 53:21.415
that you could save him.

53:24.766 --> 53:26.246
- There must be something
we can do, anything.

53:26.290 --> 53:29.162
- Guys, this is not a
call for a solution.

53:30.294 --> 53:32.078
The entirety of
Hyperion is down there

53:32.121 --> 53:33.122
trying to figure this out.

53:33.166 --> 53:34.646
I'm only telling you this

53:34.689 --> 53:35.560
because I need you to
be mentally prepared

53:35.603 --> 53:36.474
for what's gonna happen.

53:42.567 --> 53:45.657
- So how much time
does he have left?

53:49.226 --> 53:50.139
- I'll talk to him today.

53:52.098 --> 53:54.231
Give him a few days.
- No, hold on.

53:54.274 --> 53:57.277
You gonna talk to him today?

53:57.321 --> 54:00.106
What are we gonna do, ask him
to walk out of the airlock.

54:02.369 --> 54:04.632
Okay, exactly.

54:04.676 --> 54:07.069
How much time do we have
before it's too late.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.290
- Technically, 20 days.

54:10.334 --> 54:12.466
- Okay, then we
should take that time.

54:12.510 --> 54:15.121
- No, we need as much of that
margin of error as possible

54:15.164 --> 54:16.122
in case of anything
else happens.

54:16.165 --> 54:17.558
- Margin of error?

54:17.602 --> 54:18.646
What hypothetical
situation could be worse

54:18.690 --> 54:20.169
than the one we're in right now?

54:20.213 --> 54:21.910
- Worse case scenario
is he still dies,

54:21.954 --> 54:23.564
but we die along with him.

54:23.608 --> 54:24.609
- How?

54:24.652 --> 54:25.914
- What's left of the algae

54:25.958 --> 54:27.481
is hanging on by
a thread as it is.

54:27.525 --> 54:29.309
- So you're fine, just
giving up on a person

54:29.353 --> 54:30.963
because the risk--

54:31.006 --> 54:32.312
- Zoe, realistically
every day he's still here

54:32.356 --> 54:34.271
it's a danger to all of us.

54:34.314 --> 54:37.839
I am telling you, Hyperion has
anyone with a PhD down there

54:37.883 --> 54:38.927
and they're trying
to work this out.

54:38.971 --> 54:40.712
- And they're not here.

54:40.755 --> 54:42.409
And maybe we can think of
something that they haven't.

54:42.453 --> 54:44.063
- They built the ship.

54:44.106 --> 54:46.195
They have one-to-one
replicas of the MTS.

54:46.239 --> 54:47.632
They know every
inch of this place.

54:47.675 --> 54:49.198
- They didn't know
Michael was in here.

54:49.242 --> 54:50.591
- Come on Zoe, that's
not the same thing.

54:51.462 --> 54:53.159
- 20 days, Commander.

54:54.465 --> 54:57.294
If there's really
nothing we can do,

54:57.337 --> 55:00.862
we have to take someone's life.

55:08.130 --> 55:10.350
Is it unreasonable to
just take that time

55:10.394 --> 55:12.309
and make sure we've
gone over everything

55:20.491 --> 55:21.927
- 10 days, that's it.

55:23.624 --> 55:24.669
- Commander, with all--

55:24.712 --> 55:25.539
- No, we can spare 10 days.

55:25.583 --> 55:27.324
- Okay, okay.

55:27.367 --> 55:29.804
And what are we tell
Michael in the meantime?

55:31.328 --> 55:33.330
- Look, we were
chosen to be here.

55:33.373 --> 55:36.463
We've been trained
psychologically and
otherwise he hasn't.

55:36.507 --> 55:39.771
He can't contribute to any of
this in any meaningful way.

55:39.814 --> 55:41.468
So I think the best
course of action

55:41.512 --> 55:44.384
is to just keep this
between us, understood?

55:44.428 --> 55:45.298
- Yes Commander

55:46.255 --> 55:47.213
- David.

55:49.433 --> 55:51.217
- Yes, understood.

56:23.510 --> 56:28.385
- So how is your new
assignment coming.

56:31.910 --> 56:32.954
- It's fine.

56:39.961 --> 56:40.745
- Okay.

56:43.400 --> 56:48.187
- Jim, for their sanity,
they need to try this.

56:51.103 --> 56:52.278
What are you talking about?

56:52.321 --> 56:53.671
The mission is shot.

56:55.281 --> 56:57.849
We have a...

56:57.892 --> 56:59.764
We have a five-month trip there.

56:59.807 --> 57:01.592
Plus the trip back.

57:01.635 --> 57:04.464
I still need this crew to be
able to perform critical tasks.

57:06.031 --> 57:08.425
No, they cannot do that if
they are devastated by guilt.

57:15.649 --> 57:18.260
Well, I'm taking the 10 days.

57:50.554 --> 57:53.295
- Commander it's
been three days.

57:53.339 --> 57:55.689
Is Hyperion still trying
to figure something out?

57:57.169 --> 57:57.952
- Yep.

58:06.091 --> 58:07.048
Go ahead.

58:13.272 --> 58:15.143
- Wouldn't they already know

58:15.187 --> 58:17.494
if there was some
way to save him.

58:20.888 --> 58:22.194
- I know how you feel,

58:22.237 --> 58:24.805
but it's not the
directive at the moment.

58:31.551 --> 58:33.292
- We're endangering ourselves.

58:34.685 --> 58:37.165
The longer we take
the harder it will be

58:37.209 --> 58:39.298
when we're forced to
take the final step.

58:55.836 --> 58:56.881
- Put your arms up.

58:56.924 --> 58:57.708
- Sure.

59:29.522 --> 59:31.306
I was an apartment fire.

59:37.574 --> 59:39.227
I was nine years old.

59:41.752 --> 59:44.363
I guess it had happened
in the place below us.

59:45.582 --> 59:47.584
And I was sharing
a room with Ava.

59:47.627 --> 59:48.367
She was

59:49.586 --> 59:51.152
just a baby.

59:55.853 --> 59:57.289
It got pretty bad in there,

59:59.291 --> 1:00:03.121
just before our dad
managed to get us out.

1:00:06.254 --> 1:00:06.994
- That's brave.

1:00:10.041 --> 1:00:10.824
- Yeah.

1:00:15.655 --> 1:00:16.830
- He didn't make it?

1:00:19.398 --> 1:00:20.051
- No.

1:00:22.531 --> 1:00:27.536
Ava and I, we bounced
around a lot after that.

1:00:29.713 --> 1:00:31.410
But we always stuck together.

1:00:31.453 --> 1:00:34.500
She gave me this bracelet.

1:00:34.543 --> 1:00:35.501
- Sweet.

1:00:36.502 --> 1:00:39.157
- That's me and that's her.

1:00:40.245 --> 1:00:41.463
- That's cute.

1:00:42.726 --> 1:00:45.380
- You know I actually
became a legal guardian.

1:00:48.035 --> 1:00:52.692
That's why it's like so hard

1:00:52.736 --> 1:00:55.434
for me to not be there for her.

1:02:59.950 --> 1:03:00.951
- Can we talk?

1:03:00.994 --> 1:03:01.778
- Hey.

1:03:03.301 --> 1:03:04.128
Yeah, sure man.

1:03:09.655 --> 1:03:11.744
- I have something very
difficult to tell you.

1:03:13.006 --> 1:03:13.790
- Okay.

1:03:15.356 --> 1:03:17.358
- The CDRA is
destroyed beyond repair

1:03:19.970 --> 1:03:21.710
and even with every
safety measure we have,

1:03:21.754 --> 1:03:24.626
there's no way for
all of us to survive.

1:03:27.891 --> 1:03:29.544
We've known for three days now.

1:03:30.937 --> 1:03:32.896
Hyperion is that people
working around the clock

1:03:32.939 --> 1:03:34.332
on the problem since then.

1:03:36.203 --> 1:03:39.728
Zoe, the Commander and I,

1:03:41.861 --> 1:03:44.255
we tried everything we
could to figure out a way

1:03:47.127 --> 1:03:48.085
but mathematically,

1:03:51.044 --> 1:03:54.439
because you here everyone
on board with suffocate

1:03:54.482 --> 1:03:56.528
before we ever made it to Mars.

1:04:01.185 --> 1:04:04.884
Every day you're with us
presents a danger to the crew

1:04:06.930 --> 1:04:08.018
and to the entire mission.

1:04:09.889 --> 1:04:12.849
I have to be honest.

1:04:16.243 --> 1:04:18.767
I was explicitly forbidden
to tell you any of this.

1:04:21.945 --> 1:04:22.771
- Why?

1:04:24.904 --> 1:04:28.734
- Zoe convinced Barnett to
exhaust our safety margins,

1:04:28.777 --> 1:04:30.257
to try and save you.

1:04:33.043 --> 1:04:35.784
To try and figure something out.

1:04:37.830 --> 1:04:39.788
- Isn't there anything
we can figure out?

1:04:43.923 --> 1:04:44.706
Is there?
- No.

1:04:49.929 --> 1:04:52.845
Hyperion would
already know by now.

1:05:02.159 --> 1:05:03.638
This would be painless?

1:05:09.862 --> 1:05:12.604
And you would just fall asleep.

1:05:20.786 --> 1:05:22.135
I'm sorry Micheal.

1:06:50.484 --> 1:06:51.355
- Hey, Ava.

1:06:55.794 --> 1:06:59.058
I know this transition hasn't
been the easiest for you.

1:07:01.017 --> 1:07:03.323
And it's harder for
me to know that.

1:07:03.367 --> 1:07:05.108
I gotta face the fact that

1:07:05.151 --> 1:07:08.198
I'm not gonna be there with
you every step of the way,

1:07:10.548 --> 1:07:11.984
But you're tough.

1:07:13.333 --> 1:07:14.987
Tougher than I'll ever be.

1:07:18.773 --> 1:07:22.168
You know, I met some really
incredible people here.

1:07:22.212 --> 1:07:23.865
I mean, they're smart,

1:07:23.909 --> 1:07:24.997
caring,

1:07:26.129 --> 1:07:27.739
driven.

1:07:27.782 --> 1:07:30.133
They're the best
at what they do.

1:07:30.176 --> 1:07:32.048
And I see so much
of you in them.

1:07:39.707 --> 1:07:41.057
I gotta go, but...

1:07:43.798 --> 1:07:44.712
I love you.

1:07:58.944 --> 1:07:59.727
- Michael?

1:08:01.381 --> 1:08:02.339
Are you okay?

1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:21.184
Michael?

1:08:36.242 --> 1:08:38.462
You don't have to do this?

1:08:40.203 --> 1:08:42.944
- There's nothing else to do.

1:08:42.988 --> 1:08:44.772
- We don't know that.

1:08:48.733 --> 1:08:52.954
- Look, I know you
fought for me, okay?

1:08:52.998 --> 1:08:54.739
But this is different.

1:08:57.568 --> 1:08:59.918
This is hopeless, you know?

1:09:06.272 --> 1:09:07.186
- It isn't.

1:09:24.638 --> 1:09:27.250
Can I tell you something?

1:09:27.293 --> 1:09:30.557
This happened like 12 years ago.

1:09:30.601 --> 1:09:32.864
I had this summer job.

1:09:32.907 --> 1:09:36.128
I was supposed to be just
keeping an eye on this beach.

1:09:36.172 --> 1:09:39.218
I wasn't a lifeguard,
just a watch.

1:09:39.262 --> 1:09:40.785
'Cause there were signs all
over this sand that said,

1:09:40.828 --> 1:09:41.916
"No Swimming."

1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:43.701
I mean, "Danger, no swimming."

1:09:47.008 --> 1:09:49.097
So I just thought I
was gonna read all day.

1:09:50.316 --> 1:09:51.099
And

1:09:53.276 --> 1:09:55.103
there were these drunk guys

1:09:55.147 --> 1:09:57.454
that would always hang
out by the bonfire nearby.

1:10:01.284 --> 1:10:03.155
And I see a guy in the water

1:10:04.287 --> 1:10:05.636
and his buddies won't wake up

1:10:05.679 --> 1:10:07.768
and they're passed
out on the sand.

1:10:07.812 --> 1:10:08.900
He's just

1:10:11.294 --> 1:10:12.164
quietly drowning

1:10:13.470 --> 1:10:15.472
by himself out there.

1:10:17.213 --> 1:10:20.390
And I immediately, I call it
in and I don't get a response.

1:10:20.433 --> 1:10:21.217
And...

1:10:25.569 --> 1:10:28.006
I mean the tides are strong.

1:10:33.925 --> 1:10:37.363
I jump in and when I get to
him, I'm already exhausted.

1:10:37.407 --> 1:10:40.714
And I try and to keep
his head above the water

1:10:40.758 --> 1:10:44.892
and I'm there for five
minutes longer and longer.

1:10:49.375 --> 1:10:50.811
Then I start to lose him.

1:10:52.639 --> 1:10:57.296
And suddenly I felt
myself being picked up

1:10:57.340 --> 1:11:02.301
and somebody grabbed both of
us before we slipped away.

1:11:02.345 --> 1:11:05.652
And they just row us to
the beach and that's it.

1:11:11.484 --> 1:11:14.574
- How did you know
someone was coming?

1:11:16.402 --> 1:11:17.185
- I didn't.

1:11:23.235 --> 1:11:24.192
I didn't.

1:11:36.944 --> 1:11:40.731
- We got some time and
that's a last resort.

1:11:43.734 --> 1:11:45.301
I'm not giving up on you.

1:11:49.174 --> 1:11:49.957
Yeah.

1:11:55.920 --> 1:11:57.269
- Yeah

1:11:57.313 --> 1:11:58.314
- Okay.

1:12:26.994 --> 1:12:28.344
What did you do, David?

1:12:28.387 --> 1:12:29.910
- Zoe.

1:12:29.954 --> 1:12:31.085
- What the hell did you do?

1:12:31.129 --> 1:12:32.565
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, to Michael?

1:12:32.609 --> 1:12:34.393
- No, he didn't fuckin'
kill himself, David.

1:12:34.437 --> 1:12:36.439
That's what you
wanted, isn't it?

1:12:36.482 --> 1:12:38.092
You had no right to
disclose anything.

1:12:38.136 --> 1:12:39.572
And you especially had no
right to go into my lab

1:12:39.616 --> 1:12:41.661
and steal my medication
for something like this.

1:12:41.705 --> 1:12:42.880
- I was trying to protect us.

1:12:42.923 --> 1:12:44.664
- Barnett gave us 10 days.

1:12:44.708 --> 1:12:48.451
- Yes, and using all that
time is putting us at risk.

1:12:48.494 --> 1:12:50.366
What don't we get
about this, Zoe?

1:12:51.932 --> 1:12:54.413
We are already doing everything
we can to try and save him.

1:12:54.457 --> 1:12:56.241
There's nothing else.

1:12:56.284 --> 1:12:58.286
I'm just trying to salvage
what's left of this mission

1:12:58.330 --> 1:12:59.636
and that includes you.

1:13:00.898 --> 1:13:04.771
Michael, Michael died
the moment we took off.

1:13:06.382 --> 1:13:07.818
- You wanted to get rid
of him three days ago.

1:13:07.861 --> 1:13:09.428
You weren't even trying
to figure this out.

1:13:09.472 --> 1:13:11.474
- Not even trying.

1:13:11.517 --> 1:13:13.824
I destroyed all of my research.

1:13:13.867 --> 1:13:15.434
This, this right here.

1:13:15.478 --> 1:13:18.568
This is the only thing
keeping us alive right now.

1:13:18.611 --> 1:13:21.832
My last three years of
training are now meaningless.

1:13:21.875 --> 1:13:25.009
My next two years of
experimentation are gone.

1:13:25.052 --> 1:13:26.489
You of all people should know

1:13:26.532 --> 1:13:28.012
how much this work means to me,

1:13:28.055 --> 1:13:30.275
and I gave it all up
to try and save him.

1:13:31.711 --> 1:13:33.365
What the hell have
you done, Zoe?

1:13:35.062 --> 1:13:36.368
What have you done?

1:14:04.091 --> 1:14:06.833
- How do we know if there's
enough oxygen up there?

1:14:06.877 --> 1:14:10.010
- We don't, but
we're out of options.

1:14:15.451 --> 1:14:18.497
So these are what we used
to climb the tethers.

1:14:18.541 --> 1:14:22.501
Clamp it on, get some leverage.

1:14:24.547 --> 1:14:25.852
You have to keep pressure

1:14:27.637 --> 1:14:28.855
on the handle as
you're pulling up

1:14:28.899 --> 1:14:30.335
otherwise it'll just slide down.

1:14:32.555 --> 1:14:34.470
You wanna try it?

1:14:34.513 --> 1:14:35.949
I know it's I know
it's counterintuitive

1:14:35.993 --> 1:14:38.604
but you have to lift
this leg with this arm.

1:14:38.648 --> 1:14:42.608
Right side, then, yeah.

1:14:42.652 --> 1:14:44.654
You're gonna be feeling
less and less gravity

1:14:44.697 --> 1:14:46.046
the closer you get
to the solar panels.

1:14:46.090 --> 1:14:47.657
So when you climb the tethers,

1:14:47.700 --> 1:14:50.355
it'll get easier the
higher you go, okay?

1:14:50.398 --> 1:14:51.356
- Okay.

1:14:52.531 --> 1:14:54.315
- It's okay, it' okay,
it's okay, you're okay.

1:14:54.359 --> 1:14:55.839
Just start over, let's reset,
let's start over, we got it?

1:14:55.882 --> 1:14:58.015
- I got it, I got.

1:14:58.058 --> 1:15:00.539
- Yeah, do you
want to just reset?

1:15:00.583 --> 1:15:03.368
- No.

1:15:03.411 --> 1:15:04.543
Fuck.
- are you okay?

1:15:04.587 --> 1:15:05.805
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

1:15:35.661 --> 1:15:36.488
- Commander,

1:15:46.716 --> 1:15:49.153
I understand that your duty
is to protect your crew

1:15:49.196 --> 1:15:52.199
and the risks that you've taken
by giving Micheal more time.

1:15:58.249 --> 1:16:00.512
We were all put
in this situation.

1:16:00.556 --> 1:16:04.385
We have to be willing to expand
more than just resources.

1:16:05.865 --> 1:16:09.173
I know that climbing the
tether puts us at risk but,

1:16:09.216 --> 1:16:11.218
I think we should put
ourselves at risk.

1:16:15.135 --> 1:16:16.833
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

1:16:16.876 --> 1:16:18.617
if I didn't try everything
I could to save his life,

1:16:18.661 --> 1:16:19.705
and David,

1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:24.188
I need you to help me.

1:16:24.231 --> 1:16:26.538
Michael, can't be the one that
called me tether, he tried.

1:16:27.670 --> 1:16:29.541
- What do you mean?
- Michael knows.

1:16:35.503 --> 1:16:37.549
David, I'm--
- I'll do it.

1:16:43.729 --> 1:16:46.297
- What you'll do
it just like that?

1:16:57.700 --> 1:16:59.571
- We need enough oxygen for two.

1:17:04.881 --> 1:17:07.318
- Once you're out there,
you'll need to tap the LOX tank

1:17:07.361 --> 1:17:09.146
and transfer as much as
you can into the canister.

1:17:09.189 --> 1:17:11.104
You're not gonna know
how much is in there

1:17:11.148 --> 1:17:12.889
until you connect the gauge.

1:17:12.932 --> 1:17:15.239
Each of the canisters holds
enough for one person,

1:17:15.282 --> 1:17:18.416
so obviously the hope is that
there'll be enough for two.

1:17:19.852 --> 1:17:21.593
Now when you pierce the tank,

1:17:21.637 --> 1:17:23.160
the connection's not
gonna be perfect.

1:17:23.203 --> 1:17:24.640
So make sure any oxygen
that's leaking out

1:17:24.683 --> 1:17:26.163
is pointed towards the back.

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:31.864
Guys, listen.

1:17:33.518 --> 1:17:34.998
You two, never
trained for anything

1:17:35.041 --> 1:17:36.652
with this much complexity.

1:17:38.392 --> 1:17:42.701
So keep your cool,
over-communicate
and take your time.

1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:44.877
Do not rush.

1:17:48.838 --> 1:17:49.665
- Michael.

1:17:51.623 --> 1:17:52.668
- I want you to know that I...

1:17:52.711 --> 1:17:53.669
- It's okay.

1:17:56.846 --> 1:17:57.716
We're good.

1:19:25.978 --> 1:19:27.588
EV1, comm check.

1:19:27.632 --> 1:19:28.938
- Comm check.

1:19:28.981 --> 1:19:30.243
EV2 comm check.

1:19:30.287 --> 1:19:31.331
- Good check.

1:19:31.375 --> 1:19:32.768
Good.

1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:36.249
You're gonna be feeling
full gravity on the roof.

1:19:37.294 --> 1:19:39.470
A little over 200
meters to the of panels,

1:19:39.513 --> 1:19:43.039
but the higher you go, the
less gravity you'll feel.

1:19:43.082 --> 1:19:44.083
- Roger.

1:19:45.041 --> 1:19:46.477
- Do not touch the tether

1:19:46.520 --> 1:19:47.521
with the clamps is
carrying the power down

1:19:47.565 --> 1:19:48.784
from the solar panels.

1:19:48.827 --> 1:19:50.916
Loud and clear.

1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:52.352
Don't climb the power tethers.

1:20:16.072 --> 1:20:19.815
- Wow, the spinning is
so much worse out here.

1:20:19.858 --> 1:20:21.294
- You gonna be okay?

1:20:21.338 --> 1:20:25.821
- Yeah, yeah, I'll just
focus on the tether.

1:20:58.157 --> 1:20:59.071
Hold on, Zo.

1:20:59.115 --> 1:21:00.768
I need a break.

1:21:09.125 --> 1:21:10.996
Status check.

1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:12.563
- We're good.

1:21:12.606 --> 1:21:15.871
It's starting to get
easier, theoretically.

1:21:17.655 --> 1:21:18.874
- Speak for yourself.

1:21:22.051 --> 1:21:25.445
- Try not to use your
upper body so much, okay?

1:21:25.489 --> 1:21:26.272
- Okay.

1:22:24.026 --> 1:22:25.462
MTS.

1:22:25.505 --> 1:22:27.377
We have reached
the half way point.

1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:31.033
Copy
EV2, you're coming into view.

1:22:38.344 --> 1:22:39.955
Just take your time.

1:22:41.086 --> 1:22:42.914
Take it really easy.

1:22:42.958 --> 1:22:46.700
It's critical to stay away
from the photovoltaic panels.

1:22:46.744 --> 1:22:51.662
We could lose power to the
entire ship, permanently.

1:22:51.705 --> 1:22:52.489
- Roger.

1:23:22.519 --> 1:23:25.696
I'm good, David are you ready?

1:23:25.739 --> 1:23:26.523
- Ready.

1:23:29.917 --> 1:23:32.790
Just let go,
I'll pull you in.

1:24:01.862 --> 1:24:02.950
You all good.

1:24:03.951 --> 1:24:04.865
- I'm good.

1:24:10.088 --> 1:24:13.439
MTS, we're headed down
to the Kingfisher now.

1:24:13.483 --> 1:24:14.310
- Copy that.

1:24:42.164 --> 1:24:44.340
Okay,
hook yourselves back in,

1:24:44.383 --> 1:24:45.950
before you're moving too fast.

1:25:25.598 --> 1:25:28.166
- MTS, we're on the Kingfisher.

1:25:28.210 --> 1:25:31.952
Great,
great to hear it, EV1.

1:26:15.866 --> 1:26:17.172
- One, two, three.

1:26:19.043 --> 1:26:21.785
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're good.

1:26:21.828 --> 1:26:24.614
- Okay, I'm heading down
to the Kingfisher now.

1:26:24.657 --> 1:26:26.181
- You got this, Zo.

1:27:14.011 --> 1:27:15.142
You all right, Zo?

1:27:17.580 --> 1:27:19.277
- Fine.

1:27:19.321 --> 1:27:20.757
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1:27:22.149 --> 1:27:22.933
- Okay

1:27:24.978 --> 1:27:26.589
- All right, I'm inside.

1:27:26.632 --> 1:27:28.243
You're looking for

1:27:28.286 --> 1:27:30.854
the liquid oxygen pipe
towards the back.

1:27:30.897 --> 1:27:32.682
- I see it.

1:27:32.725 --> 1:27:34.814
Great,
I will lead you every step.

1:27:44.781 --> 1:27:46.304
- Tapping into the line now.

1:27:46.348 --> 1:27:48.785
Copy.

1:27:51.091 --> 1:27:53.050
- Okay, connection's in.

1:27:53.093 --> 1:27:55.357
Okay, how good is the seal?

1:27:57.402 --> 1:27:59.404
- It's definitely not 100%.

1:27:59.448 --> 1:28:01.493
It's hard to tell how much
we're losing by sight.

1:28:03.060 --> 1:28:05.410
Let's
just lose as little as possible.

1:28:05.454 --> 1:28:09.458
- Roger, I'm ready to
check how much oxygen

1:28:09.501 --> 1:28:10.285
we've got up here.

1:28:30.566 --> 1:28:32.263
We're at 250.

1:28:32.307 --> 1:28:34.831
We have enough to fill
up at least one cylinder.

1:28:34.874 --> 1:28:38.574
Copy that, good so far.

1:28:54.416 --> 1:28:55.155
- Come on.

1:29:05.383 --> 1:29:08.995
we've more that
enough oxygen up here.

1:29:09.039 --> 1:29:10.388
It's climbing.

1:29:10.432 --> 1:29:11.694
Oh, fuck an A

1:29:11.737 --> 1:29:12.651
- Yes.
-  Still climbing.

1:29:12.695 --> 1:29:14.174
- Okay, stay focused,

1:29:14.218 --> 1:29:15.567
we've gotta get these
cylinders filled.

1:29:15.611 --> 1:29:17.439
David, send the first one down.

1:29:17.482 --> 1:29:18.918
- Copy, coming down.

1:29:27.492 --> 1:29:28.363
On the way.

1:30:09.404 --> 1:30:12.058
You enjoying the
view up there, David?

1:30:12.102 --> 1:30:14.104
- Not funny, Zoe.

1:30:14.147 --> 1:30:18.282
First
cylinder's full.

1:30:18.325 --> 1:30:19.152
I'm uncoupling it now.

1:30:20.545 --> 1:30:23.330
Still plenty of oxygen
left in the big tank.

1:30:23.374 --> 1:30:24.419
- Ready when you're.

1:30:26.682 --> 1:30:27.987
Coming out.

1:30:28.031 --> 1:30:28.771
- Okay.

1:30:43.350 --> 1:30:46.179
MTS, we have the first cylinder.

1:30:46.223 --> 1:30:47.790
Great, copy that.

1:30:49.269 --> 1:30:51.358
Second
cylinder is on its way.

1:31:03.588 --> 1:31:05.590
- How's going in there Zoe?

1:31:05.634 --> 1:31:08.201
- The tank's still
leaking, but it's all good.

1:31:08.245 --> 1:31:10.682
Second canister filling up.

1:31:13.598 --> 1:31:14.730
what's going on?

1:31:17.733 --> 1:31:20.387
- We're getting a solar
storm warning, abort, EV1.

1:31:20.431 --> 1:31:21.171
Abort EV2.

1:31:23.565 --> 1:31:24.653
- Oh God.

1:31:27.569 --> 1:31:28.874
How much time do we have?

1:31:28.918 --> 1:31:31.573
20 ius.

1:31:35.315 --> 1:31:37.361
- Zoe, come on let's go.

1:31:37.404 --> 1:31:39.015
- No, we can't just
leave this here.

1:31:39.058 --> 1:31:40.886
This is the oxygen for Micheal.

1:31:40.930 --> 1:31:42.453
- We don't have much time,

1:31:42.497 --> 1:31:44.368
you're gonna have to leave it.

1:31:44.411 --> 1:31:45.935
It's
a coronal mass ejection.

1:31:45.978 --> 1:31:47.632
The radiation is
just gonna be deadly.

1:31:47.676 --> 1:31:49.373
You need to head back in now.

1:31:50.722 --> 1:31:52.376
Zoe, come on.

1:31:54.509 --> 1:31:56.336
Zoe.
- I'm coming.

1:32:06.085 --> 1:32:09.001
- Come on, Zoe we gotta go.

1:32:09.045 --> 1:32:10.525
- I'm out, I'm climbing.

1:32:14.050 --> 1:32:14.790
- Oh Jesus.

1:32:28.325 --> 1:32:29.892
Let me clip you in.
- All right.

1:32:34.505 --> 1:32:36.115
Thank you.
- Okay, I'm headed up.

1:33:05.014 --> 1:33:07.669
- Zoe, David, status check.

1:33:10.323 --> 1:33:12.935
- We're about a quarter of
the way back to the MTS.

1:33:20.595 --> 1:33:22.118
- I'm dying here, Zo.

1:33:22.161 --> 1:33:24.729
- It's gonna start
getting easier, come one.

1:33:24.773 --> 1:33:28.167
Eight minutes to go.

1:33:37.133 --> 1:33:38.438
- Micheal.
- Yeah.

1:33:38.482 --> 1:33:39.657
- Close the shutters.
- Got it.

1:33:48.884 --> 1:33:50.102
- Stay back there.

1:33:56.152 --> 1:33:57.806
How far are you two.

1:33:57.849 --> 1:33:59.634
- About to cross
the solar array.

1:34:10.383 --> 1:34:11.384
- Go ahead.

1:34:11.428 --> 1:34:12.908
I'll be right behind you.

1:34:45.027 --> 1:34:46.681
- Oh shit.

1:34:46.724 --> 1:34:47.507
Zoe,

1:34:49.205 --> 1:34:50.641
Zoe, can you hear me?

1:34:52.991 --> 1:34:54.689
- I can't slow down.

1:34:57.039 --> 1:34:58.736
Clip back into the tether.

1:34:58.780 --> 1:35:00.738
Zoe, you're moving too fast.

1:35:00.782 --> 1:35:03.436
Clip back in.
- I can't, I can't.

1:35:05.569 --> 1:35:06.352
- Zoe.

1:35:49.613 --> 1:35:50.614
- Zoe.

1:35:50.657 --> 1:35:53.225
- David, David, it's gone.

1:35:53.269 --> 1:35:54.749
David, it's gone.

1:36:09.024 --> 1:36:11.374
- Come one, let's go,
let's go, I got you.

1:36:11.417 --> 1:36:12.941
Try get up.

1:36:12.984 --> 1:36:13.637
Okay.

1:36:16.988 --> 1:36:17.772
Let's go.

1:37:02.729 --> 1:37:03.513
Look,

1:37:05.471 --> 1:37:09.519
we've still got a full
tank leaking up there.

1:37:09.562 --> 1:37:11.260
We're gonna lose it.

1:37:13.610 --> 1:37:15.264
If we can get to it

1:37:20.878 --> 1:37:23.838
the three of us
can still make it.

1:37:25.056 --> 1:37:27.929
Right now the storm
is lethal out there.

1:37:27.972 --> 1:37:31.367
Maybe we can wait it out.

1:37:31.410 --> 1:37:33.499
How long is the
storm gonna last?

1:37:42.726 --> 1:37:43.509
- Hours.

1:37:58.568 --> 1:37:59.351
- I can go.

1:38:01.049 --> 1:38:01.876
- Micheal.

1:38:04.182 --> 1:38:05.270
Why do you wanna mate?

1:38:05.314 --> 1:38:07.185
You don't have the trainings.

1:38:07.229 --> 1:38:09.796
- If you don't make it
back, one of us dies too.

1:38:55.016 --> 1:38:57.148
- I'm willing.
- I'll go.

1:38:59.063 --> 1:38:59.977
I can do it.

1:39:04.939 --> 1:39:05.983
I can do it.

1:39:14.035 --> 1:39:15.036
Yeah,

1:39:15.862 --> 1:39:17.038
I can do this.

1:39:17.081 --> 1:39:18.387
- Wait.
- David,

1:39:20.128 --> 1:39:21.607
I can't let you do this.

1:39:23.044 --> 1:39:25.046
So make it back home.

1:39:26.612 --> 1:39:30.834
Go have a kid and send
them to Yale, okay?

1:39:36.883 --> 1:39:38.102
- Wait Zoe, I...

1:39:47.416 --> 1:39:49.026
- No, Zoe, I'm sorry.

1:39:50.375 --> 1:39:51.942
- I know, I know.

1:40:02.257 --> 1:40:05.086
- I wish I could do it.
- I know.

1:40:05.129 --> 1:40:06.043
I know.

1:46:42.961 --> 1:46:44.833
I
applied to the HARP program

1:46:44.876 --> 1:46:46.443
because I thought it
would be a funny story

1:46:46.487 --> 1:46:48.663
to get rejected by Hyperion.

1:46:50.142 --> 1:46:53.450
But now I realize that this
one of those rare opportunities

1:46:53.494 --> 1:46:55.887
that could truly
give my life meaning

1:46:55.931 --> 1:46:58.890
beyond anything I could imagine.
