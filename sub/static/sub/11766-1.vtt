WEBVTT

00:01.232 --> 00:03.304
I LOVED OUR L.A. TRIP, TOO, DAD.

00:03.304 --> 00:05.676
OH, YEAH. LOTTA FAKE BOOBS.
(chuckles)

00:05.676 --> 00:08.239
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT
"TA-TA LAND."

00:08.239 --> 00:11.212
"LA-LA LAND"? WELL,
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.645
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, I LOVE YOU, TOO. BYE.

00:14.645 --> 00:16.217
OH, GUYS.
(beep)

00:16.217 --> 00:18.389
DAD HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME.

00:18.389 --> 00:19.750
GUYS?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.294
THIS IS...

00:23.294 --> 00:24.555
A LITTLE...

00:24.555 --> 00:26.397
(Tom) CAN'T QUITE...

00:26.397 --> 00:28.529
E-TRAIN, HELP US OUT HERE.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.461
WHAT ARE WE FEELING
RIGHT NOW?

00:30.461 --> 00:32.263
IT'S A COMPLEX RANGE OF EMOTIONS

00:32.263 --> 00:34.265
THAT CANNOT BE EXPRESSED
BY MERE WORDS.

00:34.265 --> 00:37.568
I INVENTED A SOUND
TO CAPTURE IT.

00:37.568 --> 00:39.240
AW...

00:39.240 --> 00:40.571
BLECH!

00:40.571 --> 00:42.143
MM-HMM. YEAH.
THAT'S PERFECT.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.514
(Andy speaks indistinctly)
(Jules) OH, GROW UP.

00:43.514 --> 00:45.146
A YOUNG COUPLE
IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP

00:45.146 --> 00:46.617
IS A BEAUTIFUL THING.

00:46.617 --> 00:49.080
THEN WHY ARE YOU HIDING BEHIND
A WALL OF DVDs?

00:49.080 --> 00:52.183
I'M NOT HIDING.
I BOUGHT THESE TO WATCH.

00:52.183 --> 00:53.654
SINCE WHEN
DO YOU LIKE MOVIES?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.326
SINCE L.A.

00:55.326 --> 00:56.627
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE
WE GOT BACK FROM HOLLYWOOD,

00:56.627 --> 00:58.089
I THINK I'VE TURNED INTO
A REAL MOVIE SLUT.

00:58.089 --> 00:59.630
I THINK YOU MEAN "MOVIE BUFF."

00:59.630 --> 01:02.093
NO, NO, SHE'S RIGHT.
THE EXPRESSION IS "MOVIE SLUT."

01:02.093 --> 01:03.534
(whispers) CHANGE APPROVED.

01:03.534 --> 01:06.097
SO, JULES, WHAT ARE SOME OF
YOUR FAVORITE FILMS?

01:06.097 --> 01:08.139
OBVIOUSLY THE CLASSICS,
LIKE, UM...

01:08.139 --> 01:09.740
HITCHCOCK? OH!

01:09.740 --> 01:11.442
(laughs) THAT'S A DIRTY NAME.

01:11.442 --> 01:14.575
UM, THAT'S WHAT THE SCHOLARS
HAVE NOTED ABOUT IT.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.178
UH, ALSO OF INTEREST...
THIS.

01:18.449 --> 01:21.582
MM. OKAY. OOH, I THINK I SHOULD
DO SOME, UM, PUSH-UPS.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.813
(thud)

01:22.813 --> 01:25.756
(Andy, Grayson, Tom,
and Ellie) AW.

01:25.756 --> 01:27.358
(gags) HOLY...
BLECH!

01:27.358 --> 01:32.393
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:32.393 --> 01:35.766
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF
TRAV AND LAURIE DATING.

01:35.766 --> 01:37.568
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY WEIRD
SEEING THEM TOGETHER.
MM-HMM.

01:37.568 --> 01:40.100
BUT THEN AGAIN,
AFTER SUCH A LONG BUILDUP,

01:40.100 --> 01:42.833
I GUESS WE GOTTA LET 'EM
PLAY IT OUT FOR A WHILE.
YEAH.

01:42.833 --> 01:45.436
HEY, BOBBY. GOT SOME MORE MAIL
AT MY HOUSE AGAIN.

01:45.436 --> 01:47.178
OOH.
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GET
YOUR OWN MAILBOX?

01:47.178 --> 01:50.481
WELL, I PUT OUT A COOLER
THAT SAID "BOBBY'S MAIL" ON IT,

01:50.481 --> 01:52.283
BUT AS YOU PROBABLY GUESSED,

01:52.283 --> 01:55.486
A BACHELOR RACCOON TOOK IT OVER
FOR HIS PERSONAL HUMP SHACK.

01:55.486 --> 01:58.219
A CHECK FOR $14,000?

01:58.219 --> 01:59.520
(Grayson) WHAT?

01:59.520 --> 02:02.893
(panting) 14 GRAND? OH.

02:02.893 --> 02:04.525
OH, UH, YOU GUYS ALL START
AT JULES' HOUSE,

02:04.525 --> 02:06.557
AND THEN YOU BRANCH OUT
ON DIFFERENT ADVENTURES,

02:06.557 --> 02:09.700
AND I'M TIRED OF MISSING OUT,
SO... NEW KICKS.

02:09.700 --> 02:11.262
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

02:11.262 --> 02:12.563
WHEN YOU AND ANDY
SOLD PENNY CAN TO ROGER,

02:12.563 --> 02:14.134
THERE WAS A CLAUSE
IN YOUR CONTRACT

02:14.134 --> 02:16.707
THAT GAVE YOU POINTS
ON ALL OVERSEAS REVENUE.

02:16.707 --> 02:18.369
WOW! A CLAUSE!

02:18.369 --> 02:19.710
THAT IS INTERESTING.

02:19.710 --> 02:21.372
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD?
NOT ONE.

02:21.372 --> 02:22.813
RIGHT ON BY.

02:22.813 --> 02:25.246
WELL, IT APPEARS THAT PENNY CAN
HAS GONE GLOBAL.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.917
(laughs) WELL, THAT WOULD
EXPLAIN ALL THIS WEIRD STUFF

02:26.917 --> 02:28.619
THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING.

02:28.619 --> 02:29.820
(man) GUTEN TAG!

02:29.820 --> 02:31.682
DOSEN PFENNIG!

02:31.682 --> 02:33.884
DOSEN PFENNIG!

02:33.884 --> 02:36.887
HEY, ELLIE, I TRIED WARM MILK,

02:36.887 --> 02:39.190
READING STORIES,

02:39.190 --> 02:40.491
BEGGING.

02:40.491 --> 02:41.792
STAN STILL WON'T NAP.

02:41.792 --> 02:43.194
ELLIE?

02:43.194 --> 02:44.435
HEY, ELLIE, WHERE--AY!

02:44.435 --> 02:46.267
AAH! I ALWAYS KNEW
THIS DAY WOULD COME!

02:46.267 --> 02:48.369
RIGHT? 'CAUSE IT SUCKS
TO BE SCARED.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.471
THAT'S WHY STAN WON'T SLEEP.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.243
'CAUSE HIS
BAR-SOAP-FOR-BRAINS FATHER

02:52.243 --> 02:55.576
LET HIM WATCH "NIGHTMARE
ON ELM STREET," YOU DUMMY.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.548
I THOUGHT HE WAS MATURE ENOUGH
TO HANDLE IT.

02:57.548 --> 03:00.611
HE'S ALREADY GOT
A RESPECTABLE LATIN MUSTACHE.
NO, HE DOESN'T.

03:00.611 --> 03:03.414
STAN THE MAN, ROCKIN' THE FUZZ!

03:05.456 --> 03:07.187
(click, clatters)

03:07.187 --> 03:08.459
GOOD SHOT.

03:08.459 --> 03:09.820
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING,

03:09.820 --> 03:11.662
BUT STAN IS STILL TERRIFIED
OF FREDDY KRUEGER.

03:11.662 --> 03:12.893
(Stan) AAH!

03:12.893 --> 03:15.296
I MEAN,
EDDY-FRAY UEGER-KRAY.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.498
(Stan) AAH!
WOW. SMART KID.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.270
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

03:19.270 --> 03:20.831
YOU BROKE IT, YOU FIX IT.

03:22.573 --> 03:24.435
HERE YOU GO, LADIES.
THANK YOU.

03:24.435 --> 03:25.936
THANK YOU.
BUT I'M STILL ANNOYED AT YOU

03:25.936 --> 03:27.808
FOR LEAVING THE SHOWER RUNNING
AGAIN THIS MORNING.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.380
HE'S TRYING TO MAKE
A HOME STEAM ROOM

03:29.380 --> 03:31.382
BECAUSE HIS GYM MEMBERSHIP
GOT REVOKED.

03:31.382 --> 03:33.614
TOO MUCH NUDE FLEXING
IN THE LOCKER ROOM?

03:33.614 --> 03:36.287
IT'S NOT MY FAULT THEY CAN'T
HANDLE "THE TRUTH."

03:36.287 --> 03:38.289
HE GOT CAUGHT TAKING SELFIES.

03:38.289 --> 03:41.322
YOU'LL BE HAPPY WHEN YOU SEE
OUR NEW COFFEE-TABLE BOOK.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.593
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT
A FULL PLATE

03:42.593 --> 03:44.355
WITH YOUR CREEPY VAIN HUSBAND

03:44.355 --> 03:46.557
AND ALL THE WORK YOU'RE DOING
TO PRETEND YOU'RE COOL

03:46.557 --> 03:47.798
WITH TRAV AND LAURIE'S
RECENT OPERATION

03:47.798 --> 03:49.600
TO HAVE THEIR LIPS
SEWN TOGETHER.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.732
TRAV AND LAURIE--YES, IT WAS
TOUGH FOR ME AT THE BEGINNING.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.904
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE INITIAL SHOCK
HAS WORN OFF.

03:53.904 --> 03:55.336
I'M COOL WITH IT.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.837
COOL AS ICE.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.340
YOU KNOW, UM, A HIGH FIVE IS
ONE OF YOUR TELLS

03:59.340 --> 04:00.911
THAT YOU'RE NOT COOL,

04:00.911 --> 04:02.373
ALONG WITH THE INABILITY
TO CONTROL

04:02.373 --> 04:03.874
THE VOLUME OF YOUR VOICE.

04:03.874 --> 04:05.616
PLEASE. I'M NOT THAT BAD.

04:05.616 --> 04:07.418
(laughs) HI!
HEY, GUYS.

04:07.418 --> 04:08.679
(loudly) HEY, LOVEBIRDS!
SAID THE LOUDEST WOMAN
ON EARTH.

04:08.679 --> 04:10.721
LET'S TURN IT DOWN.
YOU'RE NOT A STEREO.

04:10.721 --> 04:14.024
OH! MY FOSTER BROTHER TECHNOTRON
WAS PART STEREO.

04:14.024 --> 04:16.327
HE WAS BORN DURING
AN ELECTRICAL STORM

04:16.327 --> 04:18.929
THAT GAVE HIM
EXTRAORDINARY BEATBOX ABILITIES.

04:18.929 --> 04:20.361
HE CLAIMED THAT
BY TURNING HIS NURPS

04:20.361 --> 04:22.563
YOU COULD ADJUST
HIS TREBLE AND BASS.

04:22.563 --> 04:25.736
THAT'S LITERALLY THE MOST ABSURD
THING THAT I'VE EVER HEARD.

04:25.736 --> 04:28.799
LUCKILY, YOU ARE SO CUTE.
MMM!

04:28.799 --> 04:30.441
UH, SCISSORS FOR HANDS?

04:30.441 --> 04:32.843
(laughs) GOOD LUCK WITH THAT,
EDWARD.

04:32.843 --> 04:34.545
OH, MOVIE SLUT.

04:34.545 --> 04:35.846
WE'RE GONNA GRAB A TABLE.
YEAH.

04:35.846 --> 04:37.047
(loudly) HAVE FUN!

04:37.047 --> 04:38.449
(whispers indistinctly)

04:38.449 --> 04:40.010
OKAY, FINE.
THE SHOCK HASN'T WORN OFF.

04:40.010 --> 04:42.513
BUT... I'M ALL RIGHT.

04:42.513 --> 04:45.656
SO THE PLAN IS, YOU'RE GONNA GET
THROUGH THEIR RELATIONSHIP

04:45.656 --> 04:48.619
AS A HIGH-FIVING,
LOUD-TALKING WEIRDO?

04:48.619 --> 04:50.391
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

04:50.391 --> 04:51.822
I ASSUME NOTHING.

04:51.822 --> 04:53.724
(panting)

04:53.724 --> 04:56.897
WHOA, TRAV! GET SOME.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.800
OW.
(clatters)

04:59.800 --> 05:02.473
LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS IS THE FACE
OF DOMESTIC PENNY CAN,

05:02.473 --> 05:05.336
BUT I INSISTED YOU BE ON
EVERY CAN SOLD INTERNATIONALLY.

05:05.336 --> 05:06.707
BUT STILL,

05:06.707 --> 05:08.609
I NEVER EXPECTED THIS.
(taps key)

05:08.609 --> 05:11.542
(animal chittering)

05:11.542 --> 05:12.883
YEAH!

05:12.883 --> 05:14.645
(bell tolling)

05:14.645 --> 05:16.617
HA!
HEY!

05:16.617 --> 05:19.450
(laughing)

05:19.450 --> 05:20.951
HEY, EVERYONE,
NEXT ROUND'S ON ME!

05:20.951 --> 05:23.554
(cheering)
SWEET! HEY, I'LL TAKE A, UM...

05:23.554 --> 05:25.926
(squeak, thud)
(man) WHOA!

05:27.898 --> 05:29.630
BEER.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.602
THIS FEELS WEIRD,
HANDING MONEY OVER FOR BEER.

05:31.602 --> 05:33.404
DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
DONE THAT BEFORE.

05:33.404 --> 05:35.466
(chuckles) YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY
YOU SHOULD BRING THAT UP.

05:35.466 --> 05:38.539
BOBBY, I WANNA
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.471
YOU SEE, LAST WEEK,

05:40.471 --> 05:42.713
YOUR BAR TAB SPILLED OVER
INTO A SECOND NOTEBOOK

05:42.713 --> 05:47.017
BECAUSE YOUR FIRST NOTEBOOK WAS
COMPLETELY FULL.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.780
I FINISHED A BOOK?

05:49.780 --> 05:51.782
SO MANY SLASHES!

05:51.782 --> 05:53.584
EACH ONE OF THEM REPRESENTING

05:53.584 --> 05:56.587
THE THOUSANDS OF DRINKS
I'VE GIVEN YOU OVER THE YEARS.

05:56.587 --> 05:59.390
AND NOW YOU SUDDENLY HAVE
ALL THIS MONEY.

05:59.390 --> 06:01.892
(laughs) I SURE DO!

06:01.892 --> 06:03.464
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:03.464 --> 06:05.035
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE THIS WITH YOU?

06:05.035 --> 06:08.999
THUMB THROUGH
ALL THOSE PAGES OF SLASHES,

06:08.999 --> 06:10.901
AND SEE IF ANYTHING
SPARKS TO YOU.

06:10.901 --> 06:14.605
OH, THANKS, G-MAN. THIS IS LIKE
A BOOK OF TREASURED MEMORIES.

06:14.605 --> 06:17.648
I LOVE IT.

06:17.648 --> 06:19.810
HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE
THE CONNECTION, IS HE?

06:19.810 --> 06:21.452
(mouths word)

06:23.854 --> 06:26.857
(shower running)
(scoffs) AGAIN?

06:26.857 --> 06:28.719
DAMN IT, TRUTH!

06:31.422 --> 06:33.424
OH, BOY.

06:35.926 --> 06:39.169
(suspenseful music playing)

06:39.169 --> 06:40.601
JULES!
MOM!

06:40.601 --> 06:41.902
AAH!
(Laurie) OH, MY GOD!

06:41.902 --> 06:43.173
OH!

06:43.173 --> 06:44.605
(thud)
EE! AAH! OW!

06:46.507 --> 06:48.809
SO MUCH SKIN.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.682
A PALE AND TAN SWIRL.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.615
JULES.
(shivers)

06:54.615 --> 06:57.818
HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

06:57.818 --> 06:59.650
MM.

06:59.650 --> 07:01.021
OH.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.754
LET ME SEE.
GOT HERSELF A BROKEN, UM...

07:03.754 --> 07:05.756
HMM.
OKAY, I-I'LL BE HONEST.

07:05.756 --> 07:09.460
I-I PRETTY MUCH PARTIED
MY ASS OFF IN MED SCHOOL, SO...

07:09.460 --> 07:10.831
I DOUBT THAT.
NO.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.863
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT
IN MY SHOWER?

07:12.863 --> 07:15.966
I'M SO SORRY.
I DIDN'T PLAN THIS.

07:15.966 --> 07:18.539
OKAY? WE WERE JUST MEETING UP
TO GO GET DINNER.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.010
I GOT HERE EARLY,
DECIDED TO RINSE OFF,

07:20.010 --> 07:21.912
AND LAURIE CAME IN AND SAID,
"WHERE ARE YOU?"

07:21.912 --> 07:25.075
I SAID, "IN HERE," WHICH WAS NOT
MEANT AS AN INVITE TO JOIN ME.

07:25.075 --> 07:26.917
ALTHOUGH WHEN SHE MISREAD IT
AND DID JUST THAT,

07:26.917 --> 07:29.019
I'LL ADMIT
TO NOT COMPLAINING.

07:29.019 --> 07:30.721
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SO AMAZING?

07:30.721 --> 07:32.953
THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
ONE OF US HAS WALKED IN

07:32.953 --> 07:36.026
ON JELLYBEAN GETTING
JELLY ROLLED.

07:36.026 --> 07:37.528
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

07:37.528 --> 07:39.560
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
STRONGLY DISAGREE.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.091
THERE WAS NOTHING FOR YOU TO
GRAB ONTO AS YOU WERE FALLING?

07:41.091 --> 07:43.534
WELL, SHE REACHED OUT
AND GRABBED ONTO MY HONKS,

07:43.534 --> 07:44.895
BUT THEY WERE JUST SO SUDSY

07:44.895 --> 07:46.867
FROM TRAV WASHING THEM
FOR 20 MINUTES.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.739
THEY WERE VERY DIRTY.

07:48.739 --> 07:50.641
I SLIPPED RIGHT OFF THE HONKS.

07:50.641 --> 07:52.673
I MEAN, IT WAS ALL I COULD DO
TO MAKE MY LAST, DESPERATE GRAB

07:52.673 --> 07:54.174
FOR SOMETHING TO HOLD ME UP.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.646
THE TOWEL BAR?

07:55.646 --> 07:58.048
(mug clatters)
NO.

07:58.048 --> 07:59.680
(whines and cries)

07:59.680 --> 08:01.481
(laughs) OHH.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.953
OKAY, MOM, I'M SORRY.
ALL RIGHT?

08:02.953 --> 08:04.885
YOU ARE NEVER GONNA HAVE TO SEE
ME AND LAURIE

08:04.885 --> 08:06.657
ANYWHERE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER
EVER AGAIN.

08:06.657 --> 08:09.259
TOTALLY. WE'RE GONNA PUT
A TON OF DISTANCE BETWEEN US.

08:09.259 --> 08:11.261
LIKE, ELLIE AND ANDY DISTANCE.

08:11.261 --> 08:12.723
(mouths words)
OH, HONEY.

08:12.723 --> 08:13.994
(whispers) I'M SORRY.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.827
NOPE!
OH.

08:16.827 --> 08:20.270
ON CAMPUS, THEY CALLED ME
"DR. DRINKENSTEIN." (groans)

08:20.270 --> 08:22.973
THEY DID NOT, DR. NERD.

08:22.973 --> 08:24.705
(Grayson) NERDSVILLE.
(Ellie) NERD!

08:24.705 --> 08:27.007
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

08:27.007 --> 08:29.279
IT'S MY BRAND-NEW
USED HOT TUB.

08:29.279 --> 08:30.811
GRAB A FRO-YO AND HOP IN.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.212
AW!

08:32.212 --> 08:35.015
DANG IT, MAN.
THAT'S THE THIRD TIME TODAY.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.087
THAT'S IT. I CAN'T HOLD
MY TONGUE ANY LONGER.

08:37.087 --> 08:38.719
WHAT, YOU BURN IT ON A PIZZA?

08:38.719 --> 08:41.051
NO. BOBBY, LOOK, I'M TALKING
ABOUT YOUR BAR TAB.

08:41.051 --> 08:42.823
AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
CONSTANTLY JUST LEANING OVER

08:42.823 --> 08:44.955
AND HELPING YOURSELF
TO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

08:44.955 --> 08:47.798
SO WHAT? JULES DOES THAT
ALL THE TIME.

08:47.798 --> 08:48.999
SHE'S MARRIED TO ME.

08:48.999 --> 08:51.161
AND I WAS MARRIED TO HER.

08:51.161 --> 08:53.804
BOBBY, A LONG TIME AGO,
I ACCEPTED THE FACT

08:53.804 --> 08:55.566
THAT YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE
TO PAY YOUR BAR TAB.

08:55.566 --> 08:58.268
WELL, BECAUSE I BELIEVED...
BOГ®TE Г  SOUS!

08:58.268 --> 09:00.070
(Bobby and Grayson)
BOГ®TE Г  SOUS!

09:00.070 --> 09:01.572
THAT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE
ANY MONEY.

09:01.572 --> 09:03.013
BUT NOW YOU HAVE
ALL THIS MONEY,

09:03.013 --> 09:04.274
AND YOU'RE JUST THROWING IT
AROUND LIKE--

09:04.274 --> 09:05.976
PARTY CONFETTI!

09:05.976 --> 09:09.620
(laughs) I GOT FIVE BAGS!
YEAH, HELP YOURSELF.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.281
BOBBY, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT
IF I CAME OVER HERE ALL THE TIME

09:11.281 --> 09:13.323
AND JUST HELPED MYSELF
TO ALL YOUR BEER?

09:13.323 --> 09:14.785
I'D LOVE IT.

09:14.785 --> 09:17.057
MI CASA, SU CASA, BUDDY.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.059
HERE YOU GO. (grunts)

09:20.891 --> 09:24.134
BOBBY LOGIC.

09:24.134 --> 09:25.696
STAN. BEDTIME.
NO!

09:25.696 --> 09:27.237
I DON'T WANNA GO TO BED.

09:27.237 --> 09:29.339
(yawns) I AM SO SLEEPY.

09:29.339 --> 09:30.841
(yawns loudly) I KNOW, RIGHT?

09:30.841 --> 09:32.673
SO SLEEPY.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.044
(groans)

09:34.044 --> 09:35.606
GOOD STRATEGY.

09:35.606 --> 09:37.007
WHAT STRATEGY?

09:37.007 --> 09:39.579
OH, I-I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TRYING TO HELP ME OUT.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.011
YEAH, THAT'S NOT REALLY
MY STYLE.

09:41.011 --> 09:43.954
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, SWEET BOY.

09:43.954 --> 09:45.315
COME ON, BUDDY.

09:45.315 --> 09:47.317
IT'S LATE. LET'S GO.

09:47.317 --> 09:49.960
NO. FREDDY KRUEGER'S
GONNA GET ME.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.321
STAN, YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS.

09:51.321 --> 09:54.094
THERE'S NO CREEPY SCARY MAN
LURKING OUTSIDE.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.166
(suspenseful music playing)
HEY, I BROUGHT BACK
YOUR KITCHEN KNIFE.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.597
AAH!
AAH!

09:57.597 --> 09:59.770
AAH!

09:59.770 --> 10:03.173
THIS WAS A BAD WAY TO RETURN IT.
I SEE THAT NOW.

10:03.173 --> 10:06.106
I CAN'T BELIEVE I OVERREACTED
LIKE THAT TO TRAV AND LAURIE.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.108
I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
TO OVERREACT

10:08.108 --> 10:12.042
TO ACCIDENTALLY GRABBING
YOUR SON'S ERECT PENIS.

10:12.042 --> 10:15.185
I ACTED LIKE SUCH A LUNATIC.

10:15.185 --> 10:17.788
I MEAN, HOW CAN THEY EVER FEEL
COMFORTABLE AROUND ME AGAIN?

10:17.788 --> 10:19.119
HOW LONG BEFORE
THEY STOP COMING OVER

10:19.119 --> 10:21.621
FOR MORNING COFFEE
OR SUNDAY DINNER?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.353
OR JUST STOP COMING AROUND
ALTOGETHER?

10:23.353 --> 10:25.756
OH.
OOH. COULD THAT REALLY HAPPEN?

10:25.756 --> 10:28.258
I HAVE TO FIX THIS.
I HAVE TO SHOW THEM THAT

10:28.258 --> 10:29.830
I CAN BE COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE
WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP,

10:29.830 --> 10:31.061
EVEN THE...

10:31.061 --> 10:33.103
NAKED-SEXY-TOUCHY-GRABBY?

10:33.103 --> 10:34.835
YES.

10:34.835 --> 10:38.338
WAIT. IS IT ME OR COULD THAT BE
A GREAT DANCE SONG?

10:38.338 --> 10:40.270
в™Є NAKED SEXY в™Є

10:40.270 --> 10:41.742
в™Є TOUCHY GRABBY в™Є

10:41.742 --> 10:43.744
в™Є NAKED SEXY
TOUCHY GRABBY в™Є

10:43.744 --> 10:45.816
в™Є NAKED SEXY TOUCHY GRABBY в™Є

10:45.816 --> 10:47.918
(Jules and Grayson)
в™Є NAKED SEXY TOUCHY GRABBY в™Є

10:47.918 --> 10:50.250
в™Є NAKED SEXY TOUCHY GRABBY в™Є

10:50.250 --> 10:52.082
в™Є KEEP YOUR ASS MOVING

в™Є NAKED SEXY TOUCHY GRABBY в™Є

10:52.082 --> 10:53.353

10:53.353 --> 10:55.155
в™Є NAKED SEXY... в™Є

10:55.155 --> 10:57.988
STAN WAS UP AGAIN ALL NIGHT.

10:57.988 --> 11:01.061
I CAN'T CONVINCE HIM THAT
FREDDY KRUEGER ISN'T REAL.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.662
OOH, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.334
THAT FREDDY K. IS
A SCARY SON OF A BITCH.

11:04.334 --> 11:06.837
I TRIED TELLING HIM THAT
SUPERMAN IS ALSO REAL

11:06.837 --> 11:08.268
AND ON THE HUNT
FOR FREDDY KRUEGER,

11:08.268 --> 11:09.840
BUT HE DIDN'T BUY THAT.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.271
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, THOUGH,
YOU KNOW.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.905
WE JUST NEED STAN TO THINK
FREDDY K. IS DEAD.

11:14.905 --> 11:16.907
OOH. WHAT IF I BOUGHT
A FREDDY KRUEGER MASK...

11:16.907 --> 11:18.308
YI FEN QIГЎN!

11:18.308 --> 11:20.080
(Andy and Bobby) YI FEN QIГЎN!

11:20.080 --> 11:21.351
ALL RIGHT, I PUT IT ON,

11:21.351 --> 11:22.783
AND I LET YOU
VIOLENTLY MURDER ME

11:22.783 --> 11:24.214
IN FRONT OF
YOUR YOUNG CHILD?

11:24.214 --> 11:25.956
THIS MAY BE THE SEVERE LACK
OF SLEEP TALKING,

11:25.956 --> 11:28.688
BUT THAT IS THE BEST IDEA
I'VE EVER HEARD!

11:28.688 --> 11:30.190
YOU'RE SO AMAZING!
(laughs)

11:30.190 --> 11:32.022
WAIT TILL YOU CHECK OUT
THE NEW WHEELS I BOUGHT YOU.

11:32.022 --> 11:33.363
THEY'RE BY THE BOATYARD.
COME ON.

11:33.363 --> 11:35.225
OOH! YI!

11:36.997 --> 11:39.900
WHOA, HO HO! BEERAMID!

11:39.900 --> 11:41.171
BOBBY COBB!

11:41.171 --> 11:43.273
SEE, I REALIZE THAT YOU'RE
A VISUAL GUY,

11:43.273 --> 11:45.405
SO I NEEDED A VISUAL AID.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.307
I GET THE FEELING YOU'RE
TRYING TO MAKE A POINT,

11:47.307 --> 11:48.979
AND YET ALL I WANNA DO IS

11:48.979 --> 11:51.812
BUST THROUGH THAT THING
LIKE KOOL-AID MAN!

11:51.812 --> 11:53.283
NO. NO, NO, NO! NO, NO!
OH! NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:53.283 --> 11:54.745
NO, DON'T YOU DARE,
BUDDY. OKAY?

11:54.745 --> 11:56.987
THIS TOOK ME SIX HOURS
TO STACK THIS.

11:56.987 --> 11:59.049
THIS REPRESENTS...
(engine starts)

11:59.049 --> 12:01.421
ALL THE BEER
YOU HAVE TAKEN FROM MY BAR.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.823
(Andy) OH, NO!
WHERE ARE THE BRAKES?!

12:02.823 --> 12:05.896
OHH! WHOA!

12:05.896 --> 12:08.358
(deep voice) OH, YEAH!
(cans clattering)

12:08.358 --> 12:11.101
THAT'S WHAT
THE KOOL-AID GUY SAYS.

12:11.101 --> 12:13.363
(high-pitched voice) SHOTGUN!

12:13.363 --> 12:15.766
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WAS LIKE
JUMPING IN THE OCEAN FOR ME.

12:15.766 --> 12:18.268
BUT NOW THE WATER'S FINE,
AND I'M USED TO IT.

12:18.268 --> 12:19.770
MM.

12:19.770 --> 12:21.011
OH, NO.

12:21.011 --> 12:22.512
OH, COME ON.
LOVERS SHOULD BE CLOSE.

12:22.512 --> 12:24.174
YEAH, SUPER CLOSE.
MM.

12:24.174 --> 12:26.817
I THINK A COUPLE THAT
SHOWERS TOGETHER IS HOT.

12:26.817 --> 12:30.080
I GAVE GRAYSON THE OLD LATHER,
RINSE, REPEAT THIS MORNING.

12:31.381 --> 12:32.983
MNH.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

12:32.983 --> 12:35.125
YEAH, JULES, YOU'RE KIND OF
FREAKING US OUT.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.957
OH!

12:36.957 --> 12:39.259
JULES TOLD ME SHE WAS GONNA
SHOW YOU TWO HOW COOL SHE IS,

12:39.259 --> 12:40.991
SO I RAN HERE
AS FAST AS I COULD.
(door opens and closes)

12:40.991 --> 12:43.533
I MAY HAVE TEXTED HIM.
(door opens)

12:43.533 --> 12:45.896
(door closes)

12:45.896 --> 12:47.938
THAT ONE'S NOT ON ME.
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON,

12:47.938 --> 12:49.769
BUT THIS FEELS
A LITTLE AMBUSHY--

12:49.769 --> 12:51.101
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE NICKNAME

12:51.101 --> 12:52.973
THAT MY FRIEND AMBER NAMED
HER LADY-POOF.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.076
RELAX, LAURIE. I'M NOT
TRYING--OH! AMBUSHY.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.178
I GET IT. (laughs)
THAT'S CUTE.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.549
LOOK, I JUST WANTED YOU
TO COME OVER

12:59.549 --> 13:01.081
'CAUSE I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
THAT I COULD BE COOL

13:01.081 --> 13:02.953
WITH YOU GUYS BEING YOURSELVES.

13:02.953 --> 13:04.314
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WOMAN
WHO FREAKED OUT

13:04.314 --> 13:06.356
AND CRASHED INTO THE SHOWER?

13:06.356 --> 13:08.819
THAT WAS SO YESTERDAY.
I MEAN, I'M COOL NOW.

13:08.819 --> 13:11.391
WE'RE ALL ADULTS HERE. WE
COULD--WE COULD TALK ABOUT SEX.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.293
SEX THINGS WE LIKE TO DO

13:13.293 --> 13:15.265
OR SEX THINGS WE LIKE DONE
TO US.

13:15.265 --> 13:17.167
AM I RIGHT? (laughs)
NOT REMOTELY.

13:17.167 --> 13:18.498
THIS SEEMS HEALTHY AND FUN.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.500
I WILL GET THE BALL ROLLING.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.833
I LIKE TO BE
THE DOMINANT ONE.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.935
I LIKE TO WATCH MYSELF
IN THE MIRROR.

13:24.935 --> 13:28.208
THERE'S AN INUIT POSITION CALLED
THE BEAR CLAW.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.580
I LIKE TO GET MY HAIR PULLED.
HARD.

13:30.580 --> 13:33.113
I THINK I'M READY TO DIE.
EVEN I'M UNCOMFORTABLE.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.015
I ONCE HAD SEX
IN A CEMETERY.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.117
I HAD "FRIDA ROGERS,
LOVING WIFE AND MOTHER"

13:37.117 --> 13:39.289
IMPRINTED ON MY BACK
FOR, LIKE, TWO WEEKS.

13:39.289 --> 13:42.492
NEVER STOP BEING YOU,
JELLYBEAN.

13:42.492 --> 13:44.024
COME HERE, YOU!

13:44.024 --> 13:47.297
OOH. GOSH. YEAH. MMM.

13:47.297 --> 13:48.558
MMM.

13:48.558 --> 13:50.430
MMM.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.502
I MEAN...
(kisses)

13:52.502 --> 13:55.405
YEAH. SEE? THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH A LITTLE TONGUE WRESTLING.

13:55.405 --> 13:58.008
(whispers) DUDE,
HOW HOT IS THIS?

13:58.008 --> 14:00.470
OKAY. I GOTTA GO. (sighs)
WAIT. WHERE YOU GOING?

14:00.470 --> 14:02.112
WE'RE HAVING FUN!

14:02.112 --> 14:04.244
NO, THIS IS ACTUALLY
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF FUN.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.545
YEP. TOO WEIRD.

14:07.217 --> 14:08.518
(whispers) I DON'T KNOW.

14:08.518 --> 14:11.081
OH, HONEY, IT'S OKAY.
(door opens)

14:11.081 --> 14:13.253
DUDE, THAT WAS JUST
FOR SHOW.
(door closes)

14:13.253 --> 14:16.086
THAT'S NOT COOL.

14:17.888 --> 14:19.259
BIG TIPPI WILL FIX THIS.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.630
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

14:20.630 --> 14:23.894
I'LL POUR UNTIL
YOU TELL ME TO STOP.

14:23.894 --> 14:26.366
SAY WHEN.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.398
(mouths word)

14:28.398 --> 14:30.540
WELL, I SHOULD'VE
SEEN THAT COMING.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.903
ELLIE, I JUST BLEW IT.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.645
MM.

14:35.645 --> 14:37.377
I DON'T WANNA BE
THE INSANE MOM

14:37.377 --> 14:39.980
WHOSE SON REFUSES TO COME VISIT
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.952
I CAN'T WAIT TO BE THAT MOM.

14:41.952 --> 14:43.383
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY SUCKS?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.655
LAURIE AND TRAVIS COULD
MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY.

14:45.655 --> 14:47.317
WELL, THEN THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.

14:47.317 --> 14:49.359
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:49.359 --> 14:51.521
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,
DO YOU?

14:51.521 --> 14:53.193
I DO NOT.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.225
YOU HAVE TO MEET THIS THING
HEAD-ON. TALK IT OUT.

14:55.225 --> 14:58.298
YOU CAN'T SHY AWAY FROM ISSUES
WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.629
REMEMBER WHEN ANDY STARTED
WEARING TANK TOPS?

14:59.629 --> 15:01.331
DID I IGNORE IT?

15:01.331 --> 15:02.902
NO. YOU CONFRONTED HIM...

15:02.902 --> 15:05.936
AT THE Q&A OF
HIS FIRST SPEECH AS MAYOR.

15:05.936 --> 15:07.437
MM-HMM.
ELLIE, THERE WERE
REPORTERS THERE.

15:07.437 --> 15:10.280
I RAISED MY HAND. HIS FAULT
FOR GIVING ME THE FLOOR.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.642
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
THANK YOU, ELLIE.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.647
I'M LIKIN' WHERE THIS IS GOIN'.

15:17.647 --> 15:20.020
I WILL COME OUT
AND KILL YOU!

15:21.921 --> 15:23.923
HEY.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.056
AHH. I'M REAL SORRY ABOUT
YOUR PYRAMID, G-MAN.

15:26.056 --> 15:28.198
I KNOW YOU WORKED REAL HARD
ON IT.

15:28.198 --> 15:30.230
AND EVEN THOUGH
I STILL DON'T GET

15:30.230 --> 15:32.632
WHY I CAN'T TREAT YOUR CASA
LIKE MY CASA--

15:32.632 --> 15:35.305
EVEN THOUGH
MY CASA IS SU CASA--

15:35.305 --> 15:37.407
I DECIDED TO STOP
TAKING YOU BEER.

15:37.407 --> 15:39.069
SO...

15:39.069 --> 15:41.111
BROUGHT MY OWN.

15:41.111 --> 15:42.672
THAT BEER'S FROM MY PYRAMID.

15:42.672 --> 15:44.374
SHOOT.

15:44.374 --> 15:45.675
(sighs)

15:45.675 --> 15:48.518
HERE.

15:48.518 --> 15:51.151
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
MAD AT ME.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.482
YOU SPIT IN THIS?

15:52.482 --> 15:54.084
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU,
BOBBY, OKAY?

15:54.084 --> 15:55.485
THE REASON I LET YOU TAKE
ALL THAT BEER FROM ME

15:55.485 --> 15:56.987
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS

15:56.987 --> 15:58.358
WAS BECAUSE I KNEW
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.689
I GUESS I WAS JUST
LOOKING FOR A SIGN

15:59.689 --> 16:02.332
THAT YOU REALIZED THAT
AND APPRECIATED IT.

16:02.332 --> 16:04.034
THAT'S ALL.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.568
(sniffles)

16:10.000 --> 16:11.271
THANKS AGAIN FOR DOING THIS.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.443
OH, ANYTHING FOR KIDS.

16:16.646 --> 16:18.208
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

16:18.208 --> 16:20.350
I AM GOING TO SAVAGELY MURDER
FREDDY KRUEGER

16:20.350 --> 16:21.751
IN FRONT OF STAN.

16:21.751 --> 16:24.414
(muffled voice) THE SAUSAGES
ARE INTESTINES.

16:24.414 --> 16:26.516
SO... MUCH... STUPID.

16:28.018 --> 16:29.759
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.463
SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO MOVE?

16:33.463 --> 16:35.525
FLORIDA IS SO EXPENSIVE.

16:35.525 --> 16:37.727
PLUS, I'VE HAD TROUBLE
FINDING WORK.

16:37.727 --> 16:42.372
WELL, WE HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT
FOR YOU IN FARAWAY CANADA.

16:42.372 --> 16:44.104
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS
GULFHAVEN--

16:44.104 --> 16:46.636
THE SUNSHINE, THE PEOPLE.

16:46.636 --> 16:49.008
YEAH, SO FRIENDLY.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.681
REALLY MILKING
THE MOMENT HERE.

16:51.681 --> 16:53.513
RIGHT. UH, WELL...

16:53.513 --> 16:56.146
THANK YOU FOR THE COFFEE.

16:56.146 --> 16:57.617
ADIEU.

16:59.289 --> 17:02.292
DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO LEAVE,
MR. KRUEGER?

17:02.292 --> 17:03.623
AW!

17:03.623 --> 17:06.596
NO, MR. KRUEGER
WAS MY FATHER.

17:06.596 --> 17:10.260
YOU CAN CALL ME FREDDY.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.761
GOOD-BYE, FREDDY.

17:11.761 --> 17:14.334
HEY, KID. CATCH!

17:14.334 --> 17:15.635
AAH!
(suspenseful music plays)

17:15.635 --> 17:17.067
(Andy) OW! OW!

17:17.067 --> 17:20.039
SO MUCH STUPID!

17:23.473 --> 17:26.146
WHAT IS ALL THIS?
I GET IT NOW.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.577
YOU KNOW, YOU BEEN
HOOKING ME UP ALL THIS TIME

17:27.577 --> 17:29.319
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SUCH A GREAT GUY,

17:29.319 --> 17:32.422
AND I'VE BEEN DOING SUCH
A CRAP JOB OF LETTING YOU KNOW.

17:32.422 --> 17:33.823
SO TO APOLOGIZE,

17:33.823 --> 17:36.156
I PRESENT TO YOU...

17:36.156 --> 17:39.759
MY PRIZED USED HOT TUB.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.661
BOBBY, I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.163
YOU YOU DON'T WANT
MY USED HOT TUB?

17:43.163 --> 17:45.735
WHY DO YOU KEEP MENTIONING
THE "USED" PART?

17:45.735 --> 17:47.597
LOOK, I APPRECIATE
YOU ALWAYS HAVING MY BACK.

17:47.597 --> 17:49.539
AND I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER TOLD YOU THIS,

17:49.539 --> 17:51.541
BUT... (sighs)

17:51.541 --> 17:53.773
I LOVE YOU LIKE A BROTHER,
G-MAN.

17:53.773 --> 17:57.707
MAN, I'VE NEVER REALLY HAD
THAT MANY CLOSE GUY FRIENDS.

17:57.707 --> 18:00.850
I ASSUME IT'S 'CAUSE MOST GUYS
ARE INTIMIDATED BY MY ABS.

18:00.850 --> 18:02.382
YEAH, WELL, MOST DUDES
CAN'T HANDLE

18:02.382 --> 18:03.853
THE... (makes whoosh sound)
TRUTH.

18:03.853 --> 18:06.586
BUT I LOVE YOU LIKE A BROTHER,
TOO, MAN.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.658
AND A GESTURE LIKE THIS
COMING FROM YOU

18:08.658 --> 18:11.391
MEANS A WHOLE HECK
OF A LOT MORE THAN MONEY.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.823
WELL, I'M STILL GONNA PAY OFF
MY TAB. ALL RIGHT?

18:13.823 --> 18:15.865
EVERY LAST CENT. I INSIST.

18:15.865 --> 18:17.327
AND I REFUSE.

18:17.327 --> 18:19.529
I'M RELIEVED.
THAT MONEY'S GONE.

18:19.529 --> 18:22.272
YOU KNOW, I THINK I MAY HAVE
A MONEY MANAGEMENT ISSUE.

18:22.272 --> 18:24.204
YOU KNOW, IT'S A SHAME THAT
I ROLLED THIS USED HOT TUB

18:24.204 --> 18:27.177
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE,
AND WE MAY NOT EVEN USE IT.

18:27.177 --> 18:29.139
I DON'T RECALL SAYING THAT.

18:29.139 --> 18:31.141
HOO-HOO!
WHOA! UHH!

18:31.141 --> 18:33.313
(whispers) AH-CHA-CHA!
YEAH.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.286
HERE YOU GO.

18:36.286 --> 18:39.118
WOW. YOU KNOW, HOW'D YOU GET
THIS THING IN HERE, ANYWAY?

18:39.118 --> 18:40.420
NEVER YOU MIND, BUDDY.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.222
NEVER YOU MIND.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.794
YOU SEVERELY DAMAGED
PART OF THE HOUSE, DIDN'T YOU?

18:44.794 --> 18:47.797
JULES IS GONNA BE FURIOUS.
MM-HMM.

18:47.797 --> 18:50.630
в™Єв™Єв™Є

18:50.630 --> 18:52.662
WHOO! THAT'S GOOD.
THAT IS GOOD.

18:52.662 --> 18:55.565
HOT BEER--
THERE'S NOTHIN' LIKE IT.

18:55.565 --> 18:57.567
OKAY, THE THREE OF US HAVE TO--
WHOA!

18:57.567 --> 18:58.908
(Travis) SERIOUSLY?!

18:58.908 --> 19:00.470
(Laurie) COME ON, JULES!

19:00.470 --> 19:02.542
UH, I'M SORRY.
UH, THIS--THIS WAS MY BAD.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.875
WELL, LET'S JUST PRETEND
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.548
TRAVIS, YOU REALLY ARE
AN ATTENTIVE LOVER.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.580
AH!
(gasps) I'M SORRY!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY!

19:10.580 --> 19:12.922
NOTHING IS A GOOD OPTION.

19:12.922 --> 19:15.585
(exhales deeply)

19:15.585 --> 19:19.329
HE REALLY IS SUPER ATTENTIVE.
AND ALSO, SUCH A HARD WORKER.

19:19.329 --> 19:20.860
OH.
(laughs) I'M SORRY!

19:20.860 --> 19:23.833
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY EITHER!
THIS IS JUST SO WEIRD.

19:23.833 --> 19:26.896
IT IS WEIRD, AND IT'S PROBABLY
GONNA BE WEIRD FOR A LONG TIME.

19:26.896 --> 19:28.738
BUT I LOVE YOU BOTH SO MUCH.

19:28.738 --> 19:30.500
AND I SUPPORT THIS RELATIONSHIP,

19:30.500 --> 19:32.642
EVEN IF THAT MEANS OCCASIONALLY
SWINGING THE DOOR OPEN

19:32.642 --> 19:34.874
AND SEEING YOU TWO...
(inhales deeply)

19:36.606 --> 19:38.548
SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO?

19:38.548 --> 19:40.450
WELL...
WE'LL JUST DEAL WITH IT.

19:40.450 --> 19:42.782
WE TALK ABOUT IT
AND WE POWER THROUGH.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.714
THE ONLY OTHER OPTION IS
TO PULL AWAY FROM EACH OTHER,

19:44.714 --> 19:47.257
AND I REFUSE TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

19:47.257 --> 19:49.459
I COULD NEVER PULL AWAY
FROM YOU, JULES.

19:49.459 --> 19:52.592
I KNOW IF I TRIED, YOU'D HUNT ME
DOWN LIKE THE TERMINATOR.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.295
(imitates Arnold Schwarzenegger)
WHERE IS TRAVIS COBB?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.896
OH, SWEETIE,
ARE YOU GETTING A COLD?

19:56.896 --> 19:58.668
(sighs) SUCH A BAD
MOVIE SLUT.

19:58.668 --> 20:01.200
I GUESS THIS IS JUST GONNA
TAKE SOME TIME GETTING USED TO.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.702
AND I'M WILLING
TO PUT IN THE TIME,

20:02.702 --> 20:04.974
'CAUSE YOU GUYS ARE
SO HAPPY TOGETHER.

20:04.974 --> 20:07.937
I REALLY THINK THIS RELATIONSHIP
COULD BE SPECIAL.

20:07.937 --> 20:10.640
в™Єв™Єв™Є

20:10.640 --> 20:11.911
WAIT. DO YOU MEAN
THIS RELATIONSHIP

20:11.911 --> 20:15.445
OR THIS RELATIONSHIP?

20:15.445 --> 20:16.816
IT'S THE SAME THING.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.688
WE'RE ALL IN A RELATIONSHIP
TOGETHER.

20:18.688 --> 20:20.950
MNH, DON'T SAY THAT.
WE'RE NOT.
BUT WE TOTALLY ARE!

20:20.950 --> 20:22.852
WE'RE ALL IN LOVE
WITH EACH OTHER.

20:22.852 --> 20:25.425
MM. WEIRD, JULES.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.327
IT'S GETTING WEIRD.

20:28.898 --> 20:30.730
OHH!
(laughs)

20:30.730 --> 20:32.602
CAN I GET BACK IN, PLEASE?

20:32.602 --> 20:33.833
(all) NO!

20:33.833 --> 20:35.665
YOU'RE BEING PUNISHED
FOR GROPING.

20:35.665 --> 20:37.407
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOUR LEG.

20:37.407 --> 20:40.610
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION,
WHOSE LEG DID YOU THINK IT WAS?

20:40.610 --> 20:41.911
(Bobby laughs)

20:41.911 --> 20:43.913
UH, BUBBLES STOPPED AGAIN.

20:43.913 --> 20:46.676
AW, MAN. THE PUMP MUST
BE CLOGGED WITH SPRINKLES.

20:46.676 --> 20:49.819
NO BUBBLES? WELL, NOW WE'RE JUST
ALL TAKING A BATH TOGETHER.

20:49.819 --> 20:51.481
OHH.
BUT IT'S A BATH

20:51.481 --> 20:53.523
WITH... WINE.

20:53.523 --> 20:54.784
OH, YEAH.
MMM.

20:54.784 --> 20:57.557
YEAH. CHEERS.
CHEERS.
