to get my own room.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.172

02:30.050 --> 02:33.018
and the girls wanted to have
a brother in the family.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.253
So, because of that,

02:34.288 --> 02:37.256
we decided to look into
the adoption process.

02:37.291 --> 02:40.359
- Big enough
for your new brother?

02:40.394 --> 02:42.361
- He'll love it.
- When's he coming?

02:42.396 --> 02:43.829
I want him to see it now.

everything ready first.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.735
<i>- We were gonna need</i>

<i>and the first thing</i>

04:04.511 --> 04:06.245
<i>that we noticed was the smell.</i>

04:06.280 --> 04:07.813
It was disgusting.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.716
[flies buzzing]

04:10.751 --> 04:12.784
<i>- The instant I walked</i>
<i>in the door,</i>

<i>it didn't feel right.</i>

04:14.588 --> 04:15.654

04:15.689 --> 04:19.491
It smelled like rotten wood

It was weird
and it was freaky...

04:42.783 --> 04:45.651
<i>¶ ¶</i>

04:45.686 --> 04:48.654
<i>It seemed like no matter</i>
<i>where you went in the barn,</i>

the animal heads
were watching you.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.467

I left.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.710
- I wanted to leave,
but I felt like

05:11.745 --> 05:14.179
I was a piece of metal
being pulled by a magnet.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.514
I needed to be there.

"God, that was weird.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.464
I didn't know
what I was looking for.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.739
<i>- Mama. Mama...</i>

06:13.774 --> 06:15.907
[clattering]

06:15.943 --> 06:17.509
<i>- I heard it again.</i>

06:17.544 --> 06:19.010
A little girl's voice

06:33.360 --> 06:34.659
- Is Rylee with you?

06:34.695 --> 06:37.496
- No, honey.
She's back in the house.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.332
<i>- I thought, you know,</i>
<i>"Maybe I'm just freaking out.</i>

06:40.367 --> 06:42.334
Maybe I'm tired.
I just need to sleep."

06:42.369 --> 06:44.569
And I just ignored it.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.738
- Wow.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.740
Would you look at this?

06:48.776 --> 06:50.542
It's beautiful.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.046
<i>- There was this china hutch.</i>

06:55.082 --> 06:59.785
<i>Once we had my grandmother's</i>
<i>dinnerware in there,</i>

06:59.820 --> 07:02.788

07:26.213 --> 07:28.513
<i>- How was your day today,</i>

07:28.549 --> 07:31.483

07:31.518 --> 07:32.818
[knife chopping]

07:32.853 --> 07:35.287

<i>kind of teasing her.</i>

07:56.877 --> 07:59.110

teasing her
about stuff like that.

Go see?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.667
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:55.702 --> 08:58.303

<i>a kid running around</i>

08:58.338 --> 08:59.738
outside of our bedroom door.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.873
We heard some giggling,
laughing.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.577
- [sighs]

09:10.083 --> 09:12.384
<i>- So I looked down the hallway,</i>

09:12.419 --> 09:14.352
didn't see no kids or nothing.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.188

09:20.694 --> 09:22.827
<i>¶ ¶</i>

09:22.863 --> 09:25.363
<i>It sounded like</i>

09:38.245 --> 09:39.544
I'm gonna be late for school."

24:13.988 --> 24:15.954
that they were nervous

24:15.990 --> 24:20.025

for a while.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.097

24:50.891 --> 24:52.524
You know,

25:30.297 --> 25:31.563
That's normal.

25:33.834 --> 25:36.101

We couldn't find anything

27:32.419 --> 27:34.886

That vertigo feeling.

30:18.251 --> 30:19.684

30:24.758 --> 30:25.690
<i>- [muffled] Richard.</i>

30:29.963 --> 30:32.931
<i>- I honestly thought</i>

30:37.337 --> 30:39.037
<i>- Why do you go</i>

30:42.509 --> 30:44.509
<i>Do you realize</i>
<i>that it scares her?</i>

30:48.048 --> 30:49.781
<i>Did you mean to scare</i>
<i>the little girl?</i>

30:51.017 --> 30:52.817

31:02.295 --> 31:04.729

31:12.973 --> 31:15.907
I was excited as a researcher,
as an investigator,

31:15.942 --> 31:19.610
because you don't get
a whole sentence often.

31:19.646 --> 31:21.746
<i>That's extremely rare,</i>

31:21.781 --> 31:23.848

it was very threatening.

<i>I regret what I've done.</i>

37:37.022 --> 37:39.990
<i>I've never been happier</i>

37:40.025 --> 37:42.493

37:42.528 --> 37:45.062

he was hung
for his dreadful crimes.

[rope straining]

37:50.736 --> 37:55.706
<i>¶ ¶</i>

37:55.741 --> 37:57.708
- I was absolutely livid

37:57.743 --> 38:02.045
that this...complete monster

38:02.081 --> 38:04.515
was terrorizing my children.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.484
- [crying]

38:11.857 --> 38:14.158
What do we do now?

38:14.193 --> 38:16.326
How do I stop him?

38:16.362 --> 38:19.263
- We need to do
a cleansing ceremony.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.932
- Because of the severity
of the activity there,

38:21.967 --> 38:25.435
we felt like we should do
a cleansing of the land.

38:25.471 --> 38:28.472
- I'll get everything ready,
and we can do it tomorrow.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.796

It felt like these two humongous
hands just went...whoosh.

40:02.635 --> 40:05.102
- [gagging]

40:05.137 --> 40:06.737
- But it was, like, right here.

40:10.609 --> 40:13.410
<i>- I was fast asleep,</i>
<i>and something woke me up.</i>

40:13.445 --> 40:17.080
I then noticed some flashing
lights underneath the window.

40:17.116 --> 40:21.084
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:21.120 --> 40:22.252
It's like, "Oh, crap.

40:22.288 --> 40:23.921
Get the kids up.
Get 'em ready."

40:23.956 --> 40:25.789
- Danielle, call 911!

40:25.824 --> 40:27.624
- We need to get them
out of the house,

40:27.660 --> 40:29.393
'cause we don't want to take
any chances.

40:29.428 --> 40:31.061
- Get the kids!
Get 'em ready! Come on!

40:31.096 --> 40:33.363
<i>- I woke up right away</i>
<i>because I was so startled.</i>

40:33.399 --> 40:37.067
His tone of voice was
so not Randy.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.403
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:39.438 --> 40:41.238
<i>And I looked</i>
<i>into the backyard...</i>

40:41.273 --> 40:43.307
<i>[dramatic music,</i>
<i>eerie whispering]</i>

40:43.342 --> 40:46.643
The entire barn

41:08.801 --> 41:11.802

41:11.838 --> 41:14.105
- I was being choked.
I couldn't breathe.

41:19.112 --> 41:21.912
<i>- Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama.</i>

41:21.948 --> 41:24.582

41:29.122 --> 41:31.689

We got to get out of here.

41:44.404 --> 41:46.771
<i>exactly what caused the barn</i>
<i>to burn down.</i>

41:46.806 --> 41:48.773
I think Stephen Richards
was sending us a message

41:48.808 --> 41:50.474
not to be messing with him.

42:05.558 --> 42:08.292
<i>- When we were</i>

I can't even put it into words.

42:24.444 --> 42:27.578
It was miraculous.

42:27.613 --> 42:29.914

42:29.949 --> 42:32.883
- We were one big happy
family at last.

42:35.288 --> 42:37.888
<i>- Everything seemed to go</i>
<i>back to normal, you know?</i>

42:37.924 --> 42:39.824
<i>Everyone was happy.</i>

42:39.859 --> 42:42.660
It was like,
"Wow. We're free.

42:42.695 --> 42:44.462
There's nothing here
to hurt us anymore."

42:50.103 --> 42:51.368
- Get it.
