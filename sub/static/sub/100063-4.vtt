the Rams are playing
a preseason game

What do you think, Higgy?

00:26.359 --> 00:29.112
You know, as much as I...

00:29.195 --> 00:31.072
appreciate the complex
strategy of American football,

00:31.156 --> 00:32.448
I still think it lacks
the artistry and grace

00:32.531 --> 00:33.908
of English football.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.118
Soccer.
Soccer.
Soccer.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.745
Right. Agree
to disagree.

00:36.828 --> 00:37.787
Totally wasted a field pass
on this one.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.582
Mm-hmm.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.417
Hey, which one of these guys
is your buddy, anyway?

00:42.500 --> 00:44.169
That's him right there.
Coach Dawson.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.628
Brains behind
the defensive line.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
We go way back.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.673
Well, you got to thank him
for hooking us up.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.341
It's pretty cool.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.259
You can thank him yourself.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.470
He's headed
this way.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.096
You know you got
to give that back, right?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.806
What? It's mine. It's mine.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.141
Oh!
(laughs)
Coach Dawson.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.309
(chuckles):
Yeah.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.103
Man, what's up?
Hey, this is Aaron Donald.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.938
This man needs
no introduction.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.482
Best defensive player
in the league.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.733
Welcome to Hawaii.

01:06.816 --> 01:07.567
This is Juliet,

01:07.650 --> 01:08.777
Rick,

01:08.860 --> 01:10.153
Thomas.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.196
How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

01:11.279 --> 01:14.365
Hey. Hey, Coach, did you...

01:14.449 --> 01:16.659
Yeah, I was about to. Hey,
um, Aaron needs a favor.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.161
What, you guys want
a private chopper tour?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.996
Want to check out the volcano?

01:20.079 --> 01:21.164
DAWSON:
Actually, you
said your friend

01:21.247 --> 01:22.791
was a private eye, right?

01:22.874 --> 01:23.792
Private investigator. Yeah.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.001
This is my partner,
Higgins.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.170
Is there a problem?

01:27.253 --> 01:28.171
Well, I was in a coffee place

01:28.254 --> 01:29.631
in our hotel this morning.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.508
I forgot my tablet.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.343
I went back to get it--
it was gone.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.803
Even went to go look
in lost and found.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.346
Nobody turned it in.

01:36.429 --> 01:37.680
Sounds like somebody stole it.

01:37.764 --> 01:38.848
I really wouldn't care
that much,

01:38.932 --> 01:39.849
but our playbook's
on that thing.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.684
If that get out...

01:41.768 --> 01:43.186
Mm, say no more.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.021
These guys will find it.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.649
Right?
MAGNUM:
Not a problem.

01:47.732 --> 01:49.234
We will not rest till we get
that tablet back in your hands.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.946
Promise.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.409
(character grunting)

01:58.493 --> 02:02.330
Mr. Donald's tablet is offline.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.584
So I am having a little trouble
tracking it.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.588
(character grunting on phone)

02:10.672 --> 02:12.048
(beeping)

02:12.131 --> 02:13.049
Magnum.

02:13.132 --> 02:14.259
Yes.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.094
Me agreeing
to be your partner

02:16.177 --> 02:19.264
does not mean
that I do all the work

02:19.347 --> 02:20.265
whilst you live a charmed life
of indulgence and "me time."

02:20.348 --> 02:21.558
Come on.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.268
Our different skill sets

02:23.351 --> 02:26.062
is actually what makes us
a great team.

02:26.145 --> 02:28.273
That remains to be seen.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.608
Hacking, computer searches--

02:30.692 --> 02:32.569
all of that
is totally your thing.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.946
Well, now it appears
that accounting

02:35.029 --> 02:36.489
is also going to have
to be my thing.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.325
I had a look at your books
last night.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.080
They are... a joke.

02:44.163 --> 02:47.584
What's wrong with my books?

02:47.667 --> 02:50.211
They consist of barely legible
notes written on scratch paper.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.630
Also, you have two accounts
receivable, by the way.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.132
A Mr. Kama and a Mrs. Pukui.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.466
Mr. Kama lost his job.

02:55.550 --> 02:56.467
He's got kids.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.219
Okay.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.220
What about Mrs. Pukui?

02:59.304 --> 03:00.263
Ugly divorce.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.764
Husband took everything,

03:01.848 --> 03:02.974
including the toilet paper.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.143
Who does that?

03:05.226 --> 03:07.770
When you do something for free,

03:07.854 --> 03:08.771
it's generally designated
as a hobby.

03:08.855 --> 03:09.939
Or charity.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.317
This is a business,
Magnum.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.943
We need actual
cash flow.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.111
I was exercising compassion.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.779
You should try it sometimes.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.948
It feels really good.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.867
Okay, so,

03:20.950 --> 03:23.953
we should track
Aaron Donald's tablet

03:24.996 --> 03:26.831
from the time it was stolen to
when and where it was shut off.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.458
Brilliant.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.667
You already did that.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.502
Mm-hmm.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.050
(phone rings)

03:37.133 --> 03:38.468
What's Katsumoto doing here?

03:38.551 --> 03:41.012
Oh.

03:41.095 --> 03:44.098
Uh, I sent him some dark
chocolate sea salt caramels.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.976
I think I may have figured out
a way to woo him back.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.228
Seriously?

03:49.312 --> 03:50.355
You came all this way
to return a box of caramels?

03:50.438 --> 03:53.232
No.

03:54.233 --> 03:55.652
And what we're about to discuss
has to stay between us.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.947
Cone of silence.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.365
Where does that phrase
actually originate from?

04:00.448 --> 04:01.950
Seriously?

04:03.409 --> 04:05.828
Maxwell Smart.

04:05.912 --> 04:06.829
Get Smart,
the TV show.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.331
Haven't seen it.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.540
How is that even possible?

04:09.624 --> 04:12.835
Well, because,
unlike some people,

04:12.919 --> 04:13.878
I didn't get my education
from watching the television.

04:13.962 --> 04:14.879
Well, it's
a really good TV show.

04:14.963 --> 04:15.880
Tell her, Gordie.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.507
I've never seen it either.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.176
Really?

04:20.259 --> 04:22.053
Anyway, uh,

04:26.766 --> 04:28.017
cone of silence.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.061
Who is that?

04:31.729 --> 04:32.689
Detective I work with.
Richard Johnson.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.066
I think he's dirty.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.238

05:26.492 --> 05:29.245
I'm not a fan of Johnson,

05:29.328 --> 05:31.914
but I never had a reason to
think he was dirty until today.

05:31.998 --> 05:32.915
Now, case of mine was
supposed to go to trial.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.917
Homicide.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.753
The victim, Carly Kaiwi.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.296
She was out shopping
when the defendant,

05:38.379 --> 05:40.089
Sean Akina, tried to rob her.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.716
Carly fought back.

05:41.799 --> 05:42.925
Akina stabbed her to death.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.218
Seven times.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.928

If you don't want to cure
yourself, you never will.

06:02.695 --> 06:03.780
And you'll destroy
everyone around you.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.119
Hitting close to home, huh?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.121
So, how'd you find Akina?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.957
He blew a light.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.292
Pulled him over half mile
from the crime scene.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.710
The knife was in his car.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.961
His prints on the handle,

06:19.045 --> 06:20.505
her blood on the blade.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.590
Well, it sounds like
an open-and-shut case,

06:23.716 --> 06:24.634
but what does this have to do
with Detective Johnson?

06:24.717 --> 06:25.927
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

06:26.010 --> 06:27.136
KATSUMOTO:
Before court,

06:28.513 --> 06:30.807
I went to pick up
the murder weapon.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.058
And it was gone.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.019
Iosua!

06:35.103 --> 06:36.020
Where's my evidence?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.438
I don't know.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.481
Maybe you misplaced it?

06:38.564 --> 06:40.441
I took it to court yesterday.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.152
Trial was delayed
because the defendant was ill.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.154
I returned the evidence last
night at 6:00 p.m. to this box.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.156
I, um...

06:47.240 --> 06:48.658
I need to know who's been in
here since then. Get me the log.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.827
Now.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.204
Now, the only reasons
to go in there are

06:53.287 --> 06:54.914
to pick up and drop off evidence
and prep for trial.

06:54.997 --> 06:55.998
So every officer
has access.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.458
Yeah. But you have to sign a log

06:57.542 --> 06:59.001
and reference
a case number.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.171
Now, when I examined
the log book,

07:02.255 --> 07:04.132
four of the five cops who went
in there had valid reasons.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.258
And the fifth officer,
Detective Johnson,

07:05.341 --> 07:08.010
did not.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.804
The case he referenced won't go
to trial for six months.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.181
He had no reason
to be there today.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.307
Is it possible that anyone else
went into the evidence room

07:13.391 --> 07:17.270
without signing in?

07:18.437 --> 07:20.815
No. No, the property clerk said
he never left his post.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.442
I can't dig anymore
without raising suspicion.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.944
Well, we'll take the case.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.660
you finally forgive me.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.375
I'd rather pay.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.419
Detective, if we do discover
that Johnson is dirty,

07:41.502 --> 07:42.295
the repercussions will be...

07:42.378 --> 07:44.046
Massive.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.091
All of his cases
will come under review,

07:47.175 --> 07:48.843
and the trust we've built
with the community will be gone.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.261
Well, you guys
should get started.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.637

Of course you do.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.746
I need you to take
the Aaron Donald case.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.331
Yeah, 'cause it's not like
you're the private investigator.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.250

Okay, but location tracking

09:21.894 --> 09:23.479

right after it was jacked.

09:23.562 --> 09:24.814
So we're gonna have to find it
another way.

09:24.897 --> 09:25.856

is he has a $750-an-hour

11:40.199 --> 11:41.992
Well, 'cause Rick's got

the visitor logs.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.956
Does Akina have any family?

11:47.039 --> 11:48.624
His father died 12 years ago,
car accident.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.418
He did live with his mother,

11:54.839 --> 11:56.799
Hmm-mm.
How about
Detective Johnson?

11:56.882 --> 11:58.509
No. I-I hacked the HPD database,

all of Johnson's cases

12:00.719 --> 12:03.639

and the lawyer. Nothing.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.808
Why would a pricey attorney
rep a lowlife like Akina?

12:05.891 --> 12:07.977
And why would Detective Johnson

12:08.060 --> 12:10.980
steal evidence to help him out?

12:11.063 --> 12:12.982
No idea, but I did
turn up something

12:13.065 --> 12:14.775
that backs up
Gordon's suspicions.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.818
Two years ago,
some biological evidence

12:15.901 --> 12:17.695
in one of Johnson's cases

12:17.778 --> 12:18.988
became degraded because
it wasn't stored properly,

12:19.071 --> 12:20.114
and they couldn't use it
in the trial

12:20.197 --> 12:23.492
and the case was thrown out.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.994
So it's possible he's messed
with evidence before.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.496
So what do you suggest we do?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.540

18:05.542 --> 18:07.711
HIGGINS:
Look, to be fair,

18:07.795 --> 18:09.838
I mean, you knew Magnum's
methods when you hired us.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.715
RICK: Yeah,
and one could say

18:11.799 --> 18:13.467
that's probably why you
hired him in the first place,

18:13.550 --> 18:14.676
but I'll go ahead and
mind my own business.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.178
You know it's only
a matter of time

18:16.261 --> 18:17.513
before Johnson traces this
back to me.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.972
Why is that?

18:19.056 --> 18:20.182
It's not like we're friends.
Hey!

18:20.265 --> 18:22.226
Do you get that I'm screwed now?

18:24.269 --> 18:25.813
They did find Johnson's yacht.

18:25.896 --> 18:26.855
What happened to the cone?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.525
We are his cone.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.860
The yacht's not enough.

18:31.944 --> 18:32.861
And now, if there's
anything else to find,

18:32.945 --> 18:35.531
we won't be able to find it.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.659
I never should have hired you.

18:38.742 --> 18:39.993
I think he just fired you, TM.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.537
MAGNUM: You know, it's
probably a good thing.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.247
If he thinks we're
not working the case,

18:43.330 --> 18:45.207
he can't micromanage.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.167
So we're still on the case?

18:47.251 --> 18:49.586
Yeah.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.754
I screwed this up,
I'm gonna fix it.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.589
Yeah, but do you have a plan?

18:52.673 --> 18:54.466
Yes.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.720
Please let it not be
another felony.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.056
This is the stupidest plan
I've ever heard.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.891
I disagree.
Well, you would.
It's your plan.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.101
I mean, Sean Akina's mother
is never gonna

19:04.184 --> 19:05.853
give information
about her son.

19:05.936 --> 19:06.937
Why, because parents
protect their children?

19:07.020 --> 19:07.938
Yes, generally.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.189
Because they love them.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.065
Well, yes.
What's your point?

19:10.148 --> 19:11.567
My point is,

19:11.650 --> 19:12.860
is he's been in
jail for six months

19:12.943 --> 19:13.861
and hasn't had
a single visitor,

19:13.944 --> 19:15.737
including his mother.

19:15.821 --> 19:19.157
I find that strange.

19:19.241 --> 19:22.119
Sometimes you surprise me,
Magnum.

19:23.954 --> 19:27.583
Usually, God divides,
but I've got it all.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.501
He's blessed me with,
uh, brains, good looks,

19:35.841 --> 19:36.842
charm...
Calm down.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.304
(knock on door)

19:40.387 --> 19:41.471
Can I help you?
Hi. Yes.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.433
We're private investigators.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.935
My name is Thomas Magnum,
and this is Juliet Higgins.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.854
I was wondering if we can talk
to you about your son Sean.

19:50.314 --> 19:53.775
I've got nothing
to say to you.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.111
Sean is my son,
but he ruined his life.

19:56.194 --> 19:57.946
What's worse, he took away
someone else's.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.072
I'm through helping him.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.241
We're not here to help him.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.952
We're here to get justice
for the life that he took.

20:04.036 --> 20:04.995
I love Sean, and I always will.

20:05.078 --> 20:06.788
HIGGINS:
Of course.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.875
We understand that.
Then you must also understand

20:09.958 --> 20:11.793
that not helping him,
and actively hurting him

20:11.877 --> 20:13.295
are two very different things.
MAGNUM.
That's fair.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.423
And I couldn't begin to imagine

20:16.506 --> 20:19.259
the pain that you're
going through, but...

20:20.928 --> 20:21.929
a woman was brutally
murdered by your son.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.931
Don't you think
Sean ought

20:30.896 --> 20:33.315
to take responsibility for that?

20:33.398 --> 20:35.984
Sean was always
a good kid.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.819
Never gave me
much trouble growing up.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.238
When did he change?

20:40.322 --> 20:42.199
It was after his father died.

20:42.282 --> 20:44.993
He just fell in
with the wrong crowd,

20:45.077 --> 20:47.788
and the drugs.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.831
Soon, I didn't even
recognize my own boy.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.752
It's hard to raise
a kid on your own.

20:56.880 --> 20:57.714
My mother had to
do the same thing.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.384
Well, I had a little help.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.679
My husband's best friend
from high school,

21:05.055 --> 21:08.350
Sean's godfather,
kept an eye on him.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.687
Even offered to pay
for college.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.980
Sean spent it on meth.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.731
That's your husband's
best friend?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.984
Yes.
What's his name?

21:17.067 --> 21:19.194
Macario Palakiko.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.446
You know him?
By reputation.

21:24.282 --> 21:27.703
He's a drug lord.

21:27.786 --> 21:31.498
I just felt like Sean should
have a man in his life.

21:39.506 --> 21:40.716
I didn't know what he did
till it was too late.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.967
Investigating another cop?

21:42.050 --> 21:44.011
Really?

21:44.094 --> 21:46.722
Look...
Oh, before you deny it,
I know you've been in touch

21:46.805 --> 21:48.557
with Thomas Magnum today
'cause I got his LUDS.
That's illegal.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.809
What, like,
breaking-into-my house illegal?

21:50.892 --> 21:53.395
Look, the only reason
I didn't arrest your P.I. yet

21:53.478 --> 21:54.730
is because I wanted to know
who hired him first,

21:54.813 --> 21:55.856
and now I do.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.024
What do you want from me?

21:57.107 --> 21:58.400
You know, it's no secret

21:58.483 --> 22:00.861
we don't like each other,

22:00.944 --> 22:02.946
but I at least thought
you'd have the stones

22:03.030 --> 22:04.156
to ask me directly
whatever the hell it is

22:04.239 --> 22:07.075
you're suspecting me of.

22:11.830 --> 22:15.083
Okay. What were you doing in
evidence lockup this morning?

22:15.167 --> 22:16.877
Two years ago, some idiot
misplaced my evidence.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.087
Case got thrown out.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.797
After that,
I check my evidence

22:20.881 --> 22:22.966
every week before trial

22:24.384 --> 22:26.136
to make sure
no one screws it up again.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.263
Let me guess.

22:28.346 --> 22:30.766
The next question's
gonna be about my yacht.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.768
It's not in your name.
'Cause people jump
to conclusions.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.770
My ex had money.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.147
I loved the boat,
she didn't.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.274
When we got divorced--
amicably--

22:39.357 --> 22:41.943
she gave it to me.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.865
Now tell me,
what the hell is going on, man?

22:47.866 --> 22:48.784
Kaiwi case.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.285
Murder weapon was missing

22:50.368 --> 22:51.787
when I went to take it
to court this morning.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.956
What? You think I took it?

22:58.668 --> 23:01.630
I did... but it's becoming clear
I had it wrong.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.841
I didn't see anyone
going in or out of lockup.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.593
But when I left,
the clerk--

23:06.676 --> 23:08.929
Iosua--

23:10.722 --> 23:12.766
he wasn't sitting up front
like he's supposed to.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.311
(scoffs)

23:19.064 --> 23:21.483
(phone ringing)

23:21.566 --> 23:24.694
I told you, Magnum.
I'm dealing with this myself.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.822
Well, yeah, you did tell me,
but as usual, I ignored you,

23:27.906 --> 23:31.034
and... found something.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.747
Ah, come on. You don't want
to know what it is?

23:35.831 --> 23:38.125
What is it?

23:38.208 --> 23:40.669
Uh, does the name
Macario Palakiko ring a bell?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.379
HPD's been after him for years.
What's he got to do with this?

23:42.462 --> 23:44.047
Palakiko
is Sean Akina's godfather.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.841
We think he's footing the bill
for the attorney.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.008
We also think he might be
responsible

23:47.092 --> 23:47.926
for the loss of your evidence.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.719
MAGNUM:
Yeah, we're just not sure

23:49.803 --> 23:50.679
how Detective Johnson's
connected to this.

23:50.762 --> 23:51.721
He isn't.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.181
I had the wrong cop.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.641
But I got another lead.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.393
Property clerk, Iosua.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.978
He lied about being at his post.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.565
Gonna brace him now.
Do you need help?

24:01.648 --> 24:03.650
I appreciate the lead, but no.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.652
Unless you want to piss off
everyone at HPD,

24:11.449 --> 24:13.410
I think you should
let us take this one.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.169
There he is.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.880
Didn't Katsumoto forbid you
from using phony badges?

24:24.963 --> 24:27.215
I guess if he finds out,
he won't be my friend.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.216
Oh! Wait.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.844
(chuckles)

24:33.180 --> 24:36.600
Don't forget to drop
the accent, by the way.

24:36.683 --> 24:37.767
Iosua.
Detectives Grant and Howard.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.186
We have some questions

24:39.269 --> 24:40.896
about a missing
murder weapon.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.397
I didn't do it.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.565
(American accent):
Very defensive for someone

24:43.648 --> 24:44.691
with nothing to hide.

24:44.774 --> 24:45.692
I didn't take
the missing evidence.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.944
We didn't say you did,

24:48.028 --> 24:49.905
but we know for a fact
that you left your post.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.948
MAGNUM:
Big no-no, by the way.

24:52.032 --> 24:55.785
Let somebody sneak in
undetected.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.079
That wasn't why.
No-- I never leave my post.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.332
All right? It was
the damn cookies.
I'm sorry?

25:00.415 --> 25:02.584
One of the detectives
brought chocolate chip cookies.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.294
His wife made them. He
said it didn't have nuts,

25:04.377 --> 25:06.922
but my throat
starting closing up.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.715
You have an allergy?
Yeah. So I ran
to get my EpiPen,

25:08.798 --> 25:10.759
and was only gone ten minutes.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.804
Which detective?

25:14.888 --> 25:16.223
KATSUMOTO:
Dugan? Are you sure?

25:16.306 --> 25:18.683
He knew Iosua was allergic.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.562
Gave him nuts so he would have
to leave his post.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.107
I can't believe Jim would...

25:26.191 --> 25:28.109
You know, last year, he was shot
saving two other officers.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.945
He's a hell of a cop,
and a good man.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.113
What do you think could've
made him turn dirty?

25:32.197 --> 25:33.406
I don't know.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.492
Nothing in your search?

25:35.575 --> 25:37.827
(regular accent): We couldn't
find anything connecting Dugan

25:37.911 --> 25:40.872
to either Palakiko or Akina.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.749
And Dugan didn't receive
any unusual phone calls today.

25:42.832 --> 25:44.876
No, if Dugan's talking to
Palakiko, he's using a burner.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.462
Maybe we should check
Palakiko's call history.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.464
Surely a major drug kingpin
like Palakiko

25:49.548 --> 25:51.800
is also going to be
using a burner.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.718
Mmm, sometimes guys
that high up, they get cocky,

25:54.719 --> 25:56.304
think they're untouchable.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.139
We can't brace Dugan yet.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.308
I need proof that Palakiko
had him steal the evidence

26:00.392 --> 26:02.811
on behalf of Akina.
It would also help to know why.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.813
Well, maybe Johnson can help.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.941
(exhales)

26:08.024 --> 26:09.776
He's not my biggest fan
right now.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.778
But I guess
there's no other way.

26:11.861 --> 26:14.781
You okay?

26:14.864 --> 26:17.659
It was hard enough going
after somebody I don't like.

26:33.466 --> 26:35.427
Now I'm investigating a friend.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.431
Thanks for meeting me.
Why are we here?

26:39.514 --> 26:42.642
Dugan.

26:42.726 --> 26:43.852
Oh, first you go after me, now
you're going after my partner?

26:43.935 --> 26:46.062
I don't want to jam anyone up.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.315
But Sean Akina killed
Carly Kaiwi,

26:48.398 --> 26:50.817
and he could be out tomorrow
because of a dirty cop.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.777
Hey, hey, hey.
Dugan is a great cop.

26:54.904 --> 26:56.823
Believe me, I was much happier
going after you.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.199
Dugan gave Iosua cookies
he was allergic to

26:58.283 --> 27:00.660
so he'd leave his post.

27:00.744 --> 27:04.164
Oh, come on, man.
That's all you got? Cookies?

27:04.247 --> 27:06.916
I also know who's been working
to get Akina out of jail.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.713
It's his godfather,
Macario Palakiko.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.006
But no clue why Dugan
would want to help him.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.383
(sighs)

27:15.467 --> 27:19.888
What?

27:19.971 --> 27:21.723
I might be wrong, man,
but after Dugan got shot,

27:21.806 --> 27:24.267
he needed four surgeries.

27:24.351 --> 27:27.062
You know, he was
in a lot of pain.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.606
I think he's hooked on pills.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.524
He can't get them
legally anymore,

27:31.608 --> 27:35.403
so he has to use
Palakiko's guys.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.614
Palakiko blackmails him to get
his godson off for murder.

27:37.697 --> 27:41.534
I never noticed
he was on anything.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.912
Uh, hell, I'm his partner,
and I wasn't even sure.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.914
I mean, I suspected it
a few times, but...

27:45.997 --> 27:47.916
he hid it well.

27:47.999 --> 27:51.378
Never let it
affect his work.

27:51.461 --> 27:52.921
Or maybe I just didn't want
to see it.

definitely saw the kid, right?

28:09.354 --> 28:11.940
Yeah. She said her
and her dad just got back.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.066
You know, I cannot believe
that you were in the NFL.

28:13.149 --> 28:16.945
How long did you play?

28:17.028 --> 28:20.949
Burned out after one season.
Never even got on the field.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.909
But you still made pro. How come
you didn't tell me that, huh?

28:22.992 --> 28:24.953
(sighs)

28:25.036 --> 28:27.580
'Cause I was the very last pick
in the draft.

28:27.664 --> 28:28.998
Wait, you were that guy-- they
got a name for that guy, right?

28:29.082 --> 28:30.125
No, let's just change
the subject.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.294
Mr. Irrelevant.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.130

I didn't want to tell you, man.

come true.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.470
For that,
you'll always be my MVP.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.639
Leave me alone.
Come on, man.

28:44.722 --> 28:46.474
(chuckles)
There she is.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.684
Excuse me.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.936
Can I help you?

28:50.019 --> 28:51.980
No, but, uh,
maybe your daughter can.

28:52.063 --> 28:55.066
I'm sorry? What's this about?

28:55.150 --> 28:57.277
A tablet's been stolen.
Belonged to one of the Rams.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.696
Aaron Donald.

28:59.779 --> 29:01.114
Do you want to tell
him, or should we?

29:03.116 --> 29:05.034
RICK: Time to do the
right thing, kid.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.036
I'm sorry, Dad.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.955
I shouldn't have done it.

29:09.038 --> 29:09.831
I didn't raise you to steal.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.875
I know.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.334
But you told me we
couldn't afford one.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.004
Uh, come on.

29:16.087 --> 29:19.466
You guys staying in
a pretty nice place right now.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.843
Times have been tough. Uh,
our church sponsored the trip.

29:21.926 --> 29:25.430
It's still no excuse.

29:25.513 --> 29:28.057
I know. But the tablet
was just sitting there.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.017
And your birthday's next
week and I wanted to get you

29:29.100 --> 29:32.020
something really cool.

29:32.103 --> 29:34.731
I was gonna download
all your favorite music.

29:45.783 --> 29:47.869
I'm really sorry.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.829
HIGGINS:
And again,

29:49.913 --> 29:51.831
I work whilst you play.

29:51.915 --> 29:56.002
I'm just waiting for you
to tell me what you found

29:56.085 --> 29:58.880
on Palakiko's call history
so I can spring into action.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.549
There's nothing unusual on
his business or his home phones,

30:01.633 --> 30:03.218
but Palakiko did make a call
to an unlisted cell phone

30:03.301 --> 30:05.261
about 45 minutes ago.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.596
Can you ping its location?

30:09.098 --> 30:11.392
(computer beeping)

30:11.476 --> 30:12.810
(phone ringing)

30:12.894 --> 30:15.563
What's going on?

30:15.647 --> 30:18.024
Palakiko made a call to a burner
about 45 minutes ago.

30:18.107 --> 30:19.067
The location's inside HPD.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.694
Palakiko called a burner.

30:25.823 --> 30:28.201
It's here. Can you guys call it?

30:28.284 --> 30:30.411
(phone ringing)

30:30.495 --> 30:31.871
Hello?

30:31.955 --> 30:33.206
Hello?

30:33.289 --> 30:35.166
HIGGINS:
He just answered.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.960
You can hang up, Higgins.

30:37.043 --> 30:38.419
Dugan.

30:39.462 --> 30:40.630
Dugan!

30:40.713 --> 30:41.923
Whoa, hey!

30:42.006 --> 30:43.424
Hey!

30:43.508 --> 30:44.926
Watch out, watch out!

30:45.009 --> 30:46.928
Katsumoto, what's going on?

30:47.011 --> 30:48.304
He ran.
But you're going
after him, right?

30:49.847 --> 30:51.599
Now who's micromanaging?

30:51.683 --> 30:53.309
Hey, check the stairs.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.980
Hey, you see Dugan?
No, man.

30:57.063 --> 30:57.939
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.148
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:59.232 --> 31:00.191
Put the gun down!

31:00.275 --> 31:01.943
Don't come any closer!

31:02.026 --> 31:03.945
Dugan, listen to me.

31:04.028 --> 31:06.072
Don't do it.
If he dies...

31:06.155 --> 31:09.284
Akina goes free.
Stay back!

31:09.367 --> 31:13.121
Please. It's not too late.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.123
It is. They blackmailed me.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.292
And I...

31:17.375 --> 31:19.752
I crossed the line.
I can't come back.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.754
You can. You can fix it.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.381
Help me put
Akina away.

31:23.464 --> 31:24.465
What did you do
with the evidence?

31:24.549 --> 31:25.633
(Dugan panting over phone)

31:25.717 --> 31:27.510
Dugan:
I just...

31:27.594 --> 31:28.886
turned it over.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.763
That's why Palakiko
made the call

31:30.847 --> 31:31.806
to the burner 45 minutes ago.

31:31.889 --> 31:33.766
To arrange a handoff.

31:33.850 --> 31:37.770
You gave it to Palakiko?

31:37.854 --> 31:38.938
No, it, uh, it was a dead drop.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.316
Where?

31:41.399 --> 31:44.444
Um...

31:45.403 --> 31:47.030
Locker, Ala Moana Beach.

31:53.369 --> 31:54.871
We got to get over there fast.

31:54.954 --> 31:56.789
Can't you go any faster?

31:56.873 --> 31:58.499
You can walk.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.126
KATSUMOTO (over phone):
Dugan, listen to me.

32:00.209 --> 32:02.045
Only you can save this case,

32:02.128 --> 32:04.005
and that's how you start
saving yourself.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.465
There's no reason to.

32:05.548 --> 32:07.800
My life is over.
No.

32:07.884 --> 32:11.471
The good stuff doesn't go away.

32:11.554 --> 32:14.140
You put a lot of bad guys
inside, helped a lot of people.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.225
I'm not that guy anymore.

32:17.977 --> 32:20.104
I'm out of control.

32:21.105 --> 32:24.692
I can't stop.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.989
Who you are inside
hasn't changed.

32:31.407 --> 32:32.909
You're a victim of the drugs.

32:32.992 --> 32:36.829
DUGAN:
How do you know?

32:36.913 --> 32:40.124
Maybe the drugs just show
who I really am.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.171
I know because of my sister Kim.

32:46.172 --> 32:48.049
My hero.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.677
When the bullies
down the block

32:50.760 --> 32:53.429
went after me, my big sister
kicked their asses.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.890
But as she got older
and started using,

32:55.973 --> 32:58.226
the drugs took ahold
of her life,

32:58.309 --> 33:02.063
and Kim would disappear
for months.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.898
Come back, promise
to get clean, use again.

33:03.981 --> 33:07.068
Same thing over and over.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.986
She stole from my parents,
broke their hearts.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.616
And mine.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.579
HIGGINS:
Detective, we're at the beach.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.873
What did Dugan wrap
the evidence in?

33:20.957 --> 33:22.125
Jim.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.877
What did you wrap the knife in?

33:26.379 --> 33:28.423
Uh... paper bag.

33:28.506 --> 33:29.632
MAGNUM:
Who wears that to the beach?

33:29.716 --> 33:31.592
HIGGINS:
That's got to be

33:43.312 --> 33:46.023
one of Palakiko's men.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.192

Move.

33:52.321 --> 33:55.032
Come on, move.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.285
You saying it
won't make it so.

33:58.327 --> 33:59.245
Magnum, the call's cut out.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.288
Katsumoto's got Dugan.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.790
We got to get Palakiko.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.834
KATSUMOTO:
Few years ago,

34:04.917 --> 34:06.919
she came to me
out of her mind.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.130
I had tried everything
to help her

34:09.213 --> 34:11.299
but tough love, so I...

34:13.426 --> 34:16.262
cut her off.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.179
That was the last time
I saw her.

34:17.263 --> 34:20.141
Not a day goes by

34:20.224 --> 34:23.143
that I don't wish
I handled it differently.

34:23.226 --> 34:26.981
This time I will.

getting another chance here.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.326
Everyone's given up on me.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.755

39:43.005 --> 39:45.466
Are they gonna
lock the kid up?

39:45.549 --> 39:49.136
Nah. She
felt awful.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.846
She won't do it again.
Especially not now.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.348
What's happening?

39:52.431 --> 39:53.849
Aw, he gave the dad
a new tablet,

39:53.933 --> 39:55.935
plus two tickets
to the game.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.145
That's one hell
of a thing to do.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.106
He said to thank you.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.024
Oh, it was nothing.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.943
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.
You didn't do anything.

40:04.026 --> 40:05.569
He also offered
to pay you.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.947
I said no.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.615
You did?

40:09.698 --> 40:10.908
I was just gonna ask him
for another ticket.

40:10.991 --> 40:13.327
By the way,

40:15.746 --> 40:17.623
do you think maybe you can hook
me up with just one more ticket?

40:22.878 --> 40:24.463
(cheering)

40:26.715 --> 40:28.968
Oh!

40:29.051 --> 40:33.514
Hey, pal, give me a piece
of that pretzel, will you?

40:33.597 --> 40:35.891
Ha! I cannot believe that you
were Mr. Irrelevant. Thank you.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.726
Hey.
Forget I told you that
or go hungry.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.353
Your choice.
Go hungry.

40:39.436 --> 40:41.355
Okay.

40:41.438 --> 40:44.358
Come on.
Admit it.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.528
How much do you love
being my partner?

40:47.611 --> 40:49.989
Love is a very
strong word, Magnum.
(chuckles)

40:50.072 --> 40:52.533
But, uh, I don't hate it.

40:52.616 --> 40:55.536
Oh. By the way,

40:55.619 --> 40:58.080
I decided to, um,
take your advice,

40:58.164 --> 41:01.000
and exercise
a little compassion.

41:01.083 --> 41:04.753
Really?
What'd you do?
Mm-hmm.

41:04.837 --> 41:07.006
Gordon's done us so many favors,
and our fees are really high

41:07.089 --> 41:09.717
for someone on
a cop's salary.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.093
Smart. You gave
him a discount?

41:12.094 --> 41:14.388
I waived our fee.

41:14.471 --> 41:16.056
You could've
waived your half.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.391
Mm.

41:17.474 --> 41:19.101
Scoot over.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.606
Come on.

41:23.689 --> 41:25.065
Hey, buddy.
Hey, pal.

41:25.149 --> 41:28.068
Swap seats?

41:28.152 --> 41:29.361
It's gonna cost you.
What? What do you need?

41:29.445 --> 41:31.030
I think you know
what I need, buddy.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.783
Get it.
There we go.

41:34.867 --> 41:35.910
TC, my man.
Oh.

41:35.993 --> 41:38.037
How's the view
right there?

41:45.294 --> 41:47.630
Great.
Mind if I check it out?

41:47.713 --> 41:50.382
Katsumoto.

41:50.466 --> 41:53.135
Spent 400 bucks.
Macadamia nuts.

41:53.219 --> 41:57.056
Chocolate sea salt-
covered caramels.

41:57.139 --> 41:58.307
I solved your case.
Apparently for free.

41:58.390 --> 42:01.602
And I got you these
amazing seats.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.187
Come on. What-what is it gonna
take to be your friend again?

42:03.270 --> 42:06.065
We were never friends, Magnum.

42:06.148 --> 42:07.608
You see, I don't buy that,
because if we weren't.

42:07.691 --> 42:11.070
you wouldn't be
so mad at me.

42:11.153 --> 42:12.029
So just tell me.
How-how do I say...

42:12.112 --> 42:14.406
"I'm sorry"?

42:17.159 --> 42:18.410
Well, you can start
by actually saying it.

42:18.494 --> 42:20.246
Wait, I never
said I'm sorry?

42:23.707 --> 42:24.833
Nope.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.842
Well, I'm sorry.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.308
(chuckles)
Give me some of those.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.143
Oh!
(all cheering)

42:43.227 --> 42:44.436
About time!
