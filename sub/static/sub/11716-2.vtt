WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:05.380
Hey.
BOTH: Hey.

00:05.422 --> 00:06.590
Where's Adam?

00:06.632 --> 00:08.216
Or, uh, as he's
also known as,

00:08.258 --> 00:10.093
that guy you're
settling for?

00:11.637 --> 00:13.514
He's back at the apartment
doing some research.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.933
(LAUGHS) Doing research?

00:15.975 --> 00:16.809
That's hilari...

00:17.810 --> 00:19.353
'Cause it's true.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.940
Uh, what's he researching?

00:22.982 --> 00:24.566
New leads on
Waldo's whereabouts?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.570
No, bicycles.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.280
We're buying a couple
so we can cruise around
the park.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.282
Aw, that's sweet.

00:32.324 --> 00:33.325
Remember when we
used to do...
No.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.493
No? Yeah.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.205
Although something exciting
did happen last night.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.582
Audrey, I'm a grown man.

00:40.624 --> 00:42.334
Second base is nothing
to brag about.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.796
Not that, Jeff.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.631
You know how
we've been arguing about
what to name our baby?

00:47.673 --> 00:50.342
Yeah...you guys
have been fighting like,
well, you guys.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.304
She wants to honor
her grandmother Stella...

00:55.263 --> 00:56.431
Like the mustache
hall of fame

00:56.473 --> 00:59.142
didn't honor her enough.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.353
Oh, and you're
contributions
have been strong.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.104
"Olivia Newton Bingham."

01:04.439 --> 01:06.066
We agreed on a name.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.735
Ooh!
Do I get to hear it?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.319
I'm dying to tell you,
but we're gonna
keep it secret.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.362
I totally get it.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.113
Ah.

01:12.155 --> 01:15.450
Hmm...one, two,
three, four, five boobs.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.410
Interesting.

01:18.328 --> 01:23.667
Ah, look, it's the love child
of Diane Sawyer and a goat.
(SNORTS)

01:23.709 --> 01:25.878
Prize-winning journalist,
petting zoo favorite.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.880
Ah, that's not too bad.
I'll take it.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.590
Who wants to hear
about my night?

01:29.631 --> 01:30.799
God, no.
Please, no.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.260
Inconclusive.
So, I go out.

01:33.301 --> 01:36.221
I haunt, I stalk, I bag,
and I get home,

01:36.263 --> 01:38.348
and this girl Madison,
she's a go-er.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.934
You know the type?
Wait, what was her name?

01:39.975 --> 01:41.226
Her name's Madison.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.853
Now, my camera phone
was on the fritz,

01:42.895 --> 01:44.646
but I did manage
to get some audio

01:44.688 --> 01:46.023
for your listening
pleasure.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.483
Oh, yeah, Madison.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.277
Aw, that's crazy, Madison.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.654
Aw...oh, Madison,
good God...

01:52.696 --> 01:53.864
What won't you
let me do?

01:53.906 --> 01:55.240
Oh, enough! Enough!
Turn it off!

01:55.282 --> 01:57.117
You ruined Madison!

01:57.158 --> 01:59.703
Well, I think her dad
not paying attention to her

01:59.745 --> 02:01.580
had to factor in
a little bit, but...

02:02.915 --> 02:04.917
We were gonna name
our baby Madison.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.919
Aw, I love that name.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.337
Yeah, it really
rolls off the tongue.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.090
You know, it's funny
I bring that up, because...

02:11.131 --> 02:13.258
Don't.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.260
Come on, you're
seriously not gonna
use "Madison" now?

02:15.302 --> 02:16.595
Are you kidding me?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.346
I'm not gonna use
Madison Avenue.

02:20.348 --> 02:23.143
Now we gotta find
a name that hasn't
been sullied by Russell.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.395
That's gonna be
a tough needle to thread.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.273
All right, I am gonna
need a list of the names

02:28.315 --> 02:30.191
of every girl
you've ever been with.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.526
Well, I'm sure
that's on file

02:31.568 --> 02:32.778
at the center for
disease control.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.197
That's a good
jumping-off point,

02:36.239 --> 02:39.284
but I don't think
it gives you
the whole story.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.495
Okay, seriously,
I need names ASAP.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.413
(CHUCKLES)
All right, fine,

02:43.455 --> 02:44.915
but here's a heads-up.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.750
You probably also
don't want to name
your kid

02:46.792 --> 02:48.627
"Madison's hot, vaguely
Asian roommate" either.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.795
What? Yeah, I did.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.302
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

03:00.179 --> 03:03.142
♪ How many ways
to say that I'm not scared?

03:04.643 --> 03:09.648
♪ With you by my side
There is no denying

03:09.690 --> 03:12.275
♪ I can't wait
for me and you ♪

03:22.536 --> 03:24.121
Hey, can I help you?

03:24.163 --> 03:25.539
I'm meeting my
fiance here.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.414
We're gonna look
at some bikes.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.299
What happened?
I was five minutes late.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.510
Seems you answered
your own question.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.890
Jen, I told my man
Javier here

03:42.931 --> 03:45.308
that I got the need
for speed, brah.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.519
He did. He said it
exactly that way.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.691
We were just gonna buy
a couple of cheap cruisers.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.069
(EXHALES) You sound like me
five minutes ago.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.820
Hey, check it out.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.321
Javier said
this bike right here...

03:58.363 --> 04:01.491
Newest technology,
top of the line.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.202
You know how they make
this thing so light?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.620
Hmm? No?
Carbon feathers.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.081
Fibers.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.040
Let's not have
this argument again.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.209
How much is that thing?

04:11.501 --> 04:13.712
Um, honey,
it's kind of rude

04:13.754 --> 04:15.214
to ask someone
what they paid
for something.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.049
You bought it?

04:17.091 --> 04:18.842
In 23 more payments,
I will have.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.265
I even picked out
a steel horse for you.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.268
Adam, we can't afford these.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.728
Again,
me five minutes ago.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.897
Ugh!

04:37.236 --> 04:38.904
Hey, Timmy.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.781
There's a new deli
opening downstairs.

04:40.822 --> 04:41.949
I figured you'd be
all over it.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.577
Sir, might we have
just one day

04:45.619 --> 04:46.745
without you belittling
my ancestry?

04:48.122 --> 04:49.664
You got it, buddy.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.125
Now, listen, I need you
to put on your
thinking turban, okay?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.754
You know how you're
always wanting to do
things around here

04:55.796 --> 04:57.798
that are more related
to actual real estate?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.299
Yes.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.009
I want you
to make a list
of all the chicks

05:01.051 --> 05:03.428
that I, a real estate guy,
have taken to pound town.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.975
Why, sir?

05:08.016 --> 05:09.268
Nosy.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.980
Well, if you must know,
Jeff and Audrey

05:13.021 --> 05:15.482
don't want their baby
to share a name
with any of the, uh,

05:15.523 --> 05:16.942
delightful ladies
I've jack hammered.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.694
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

05:19.736 --> 05:21.655
Ladies, indeed.
Yeah.

05:21.696 --> 05:22.906
And I'm thinking
it shouldn't just be a list.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.908
We should take
this opportunity

05:24.950 --> 05:28.287
to create a rich,
detailed account of
all my conquests.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.038
A sexual tapestry,
if you will.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.168
I will not.
Okay, great.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.544
Here's some stuff
to get you started.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.131
Photos, journals,
black books.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.966
And do a good job, Tim,
all right?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.968
'Cause one day,
when I'm old...
Today.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.681
When I'm older,
this will be my legacy.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.728
Or, sir, perhaps
you'll change your
lecherous ways.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.523
Settle down,
maybe have a son,

05:56.564 --> 05:58.525
and that will be
your legacy.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.027
Yeah, but that kid
deserves to know

06:00.068 --> 06:01.486
what a tail wrangler
his dad was.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.571
Get to work.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.125
All right.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.502
I'm gonna take a bus
up to the Hudson Valley
and get my ride on.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.630
Have fun delivering
that package

06:20.672 --> 06:22.007
that everyone
can clearly see.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.096
Hey, a real cyclist

06:28.138 --> 06:29.890
is happy to trade modesty
for aerodynamics.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.019
Still think
you should've
gotten a bike.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.436
Well, as much
as I'd like to force

06:35.478 --> 06:37.231
doll clothes
over my genitalia,

06:39.149 --> 06:41.068
you already spent
too much on yours.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.694
Once you owe money
to a credit card company,

06:42.736 --> 06:43.862
does it really matter
how much?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.741
Yes.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.202
The more you owe,
the more interest
you accrue each month.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.578
Well, I'm certainly
not accruing

06:51.619 --> 06:53.080
any interest
in this conversation.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.541
What's that dumb thing
on your helmet?

06:56.583 --> 06:58.793
HD camera.
Best thing money can buy.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.628
You know why?

07:00.670 --> 07:01.922
There's 10 pixies in here.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.842
Pixels?

07:05.884 --> 07:08.095
That's the exact argument
I was having with Javi.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.265
Anyway, bottom line is,

07:11.306 --> 07:13.350
recording your rides
can only make you better,

07:13.392 --> 07:15.476
and maybe,
when you watch it back,

07:15.518 --> 07:16.728
it'll inspire you.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.480
To marry someone else?
Maybe.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.069
Yes, hello.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.904
Um, I'm seeking the name
of one of your employees

07:25.946 --> 07:27.572
with the initials L.P.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.575
Ms. Lolly Pops.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.539
Sounds about right.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.250
Oh, she's on the
main stage right now,
is she?

07:40.043 --> 07:42.170
Smashing. Thank you.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.504
(SIGHS)
All right, Tim,

07:43.546 --> 07:46.425
I got a lotta
more names here
for my sex-clopedia.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.845
Some of these, uh, chicks,
I can't remember their name,

07:50.887 --> 07:52.264
but I'm sure
I yelled them out
at some point.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.434
VHS tapes?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.186
Yeah, can you be a lamb,
and convert them to digital,

07:58.228 --> 08:01.064
or DVD, or whatever
the latest nerd thing is?

08:02.649 --> 08:03.650
But you know what?
Your call.

08:03.691 --> 08:04.859
I don't wanna micromanage.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.571
Oh, Audrey, hey!

08:08.613 --> 08:09.739
Wanna be in a book?

08:11.908 --> 08:13.118
No, I've come up with
some more baby names,

08:13.160 --> 08:14.577
and I wanna make sure
you haven't defiled them.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.371
Oh, well,
I'm out of the loop now.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.665
That's Timmy's department.
He's my sexual biographer.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.877
Yes, and in my spare time,

08:22.919 --> 08:24.296
I'm also working
on a suicide note.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.634
All right, Zoe?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.012
Sorry, Zoe's been used.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.975
And by "used,"
he means a-used.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.810
(CHUCKLES)
Write that down.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.229
Uh, Jenna?
Nope.

08:41.271 --> 08:42.814
Annie? Taylor?
No. Sorry.

08:42.856 --> 08:43.982
McKenna?
Nyet.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.525
Lauren? Sarah?
Uh-uh. I wish.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.567
Avery?
Swing and a miss.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.028
Damn it, Russell!

08:49.988 --> 08:52.491
Looks like it's back
to the drawing board.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.535
Oh, that reminds me.
You can't use "Claire"
either.

08:55.576 --> 08:56.953
Why does that remind you?

08:56.995 --> 08:59.456
Because that's
a cartoonist I dated,

08:59.498 --> 09:01.249
and I nailed her
with her back

09:01.291 --> 09:02.459
to the drawing board.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.563
Oh, my God,
what happened to you?
Nothing.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.690
I just rode hard.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.026
(EXHALES)
You know, no pain...

09:30.111 --> 09:31.112
I forget the rest of it.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.324
Where is your bike?

09:34.366 --> 09:37.494
Oh, um,
it's at the shop.
Why?

09:37.536 --> 09:39.954
Geez, honey, can't
a guy have a completely
uneventful bike ride

09:39.996 --> 09:41.164
without getting
the third degree?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.792
Where are your shoes?

09:44.834 --> 09:46.711
You know, how'd you
like it if I asked you
that question, huh?

09:46.753 --> 09:47.628
Where are your shoes?

09:48.213 --> 09:49.256
They're on my feet.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.465
There you go.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.218
There you go.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.386
I'm just gonna go shower.

those SpongeBob-sicles.

My foot is stuck?

10:43.726 --> 10:44.603
What are the odds?

10:49.732 --> 10:51.610
All right, Timmy,
how about Emily?

10:53.236 --> 10:55.196
Ugh, how does he do it?

10:58.450 --> 11:01.702
Ew, no, I didn't really
wanna know how he did it.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.581
Well, what'd Timmy say?
Emily's out.

11:04.623 --> 11:05.873
No, I mean,
how'd Russell do it?

11:08.709 --> 11:10.878
He did offer up a list
of usable names,

11:10.920 --> 11:13.381
Gladys, Agnes, and Beatrice,

11:13.423 --> 11:16.009
so we're covered
if our baby's born
an old nun.

Hey, what about Sky?

11:19.554 --> 11:21.139
Or Jameson?

11:22.056 --> 11:23.266
Or Bailey?

11:24.767 --> 11:26.685
We're not naming her
after bottles of liquor.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.773
Fine, how about Charlie?
Or Joe?

11:30.815 --> 11:33.234
Okay, we don't
want her to know you
were hoping for a boy.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.030
Look, I'm happy either way,
just as long as he's healthy.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.948
"She."

11:38.990 --> 11:40.617
What'd I say?
Okay, Jeff.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.245
You make a lot of jokes
about wanting a boy.

11:44.287 --> 11:45.955
Is that still
really a joke,

11:45.997 --> 11:47.123
or is this,
like, a serious thing?

11:47.165 --> 11:48.458
No, it's just...

11:48.500 --> 11:52.379
I, I always pictured
having a boy.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.172
Well, you gotta change
your picture, babe.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.896

hairy female relative names,

'cause my fiancee thinks
I'm out on a bike ride,

and I can't let her know
that I lost my bike,

15:01.860 --> 15:03.820

costs a lot more
than I told her it did.

Okay, fine.
Go ahead.

you're enjoying your bike
so much.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.638
Oh, yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.723
Even though it cost
what it did...

15:31.765 --> 15:35.476
And not a penny more.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.979
It's worth it, you know,
for the many years
of enjoyment you'll get.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.608
Mmm, yeah.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.652
Although, honey,
to be honest,
you know, that ride...

15:44.694 --> 15:46.780
That ride was so great

15:46.821 --> 15:48.489
that it alone was
worth the cost,

15:48.531 --> 15:52.076
so if I were to,
hypothetically, like,
never have to ride

15:52.118 --> 15:53.578
that bike again,
I feel that...

15:53.620 --> 15:54.704
Adam,

15:56.748 --> 15:58.750
I just watched the video
from your helmet cam.

Oh, I already ate.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.222
I know. That's why
I just got the one.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.727
So you wanna take
another stab at coming up
with a baby name?

16:18.436 --> 16:20.271
Why?

16:20.313 --> 16:21.940
Did you go by
a liquor store and
do some research?

16:23.858 --> 16:25.485
No, and here's the thing.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.695
I did some thinking,
on my own.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.032
Wow, is there more?

16:32.074 --> 16:33.952
'Cause I'm already impressed.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.538
There's more,
and I figured out

16:37.580 --> 16:39.290
why I'm worried
about having a girl.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.168
It's not because
I'm disappointed.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.754
It's because I'm not sure
that I have faith in myself.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.631
I don't have
the greatest history

16:46.673 --> 16:47.966
at understanding female...

16:49.175 --> 16:50.343
Girls.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.013
You did once say
a uterus reminded you

16:54.054 --> 16:55.890
of those cow skulls
you see in the desert.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.644
Put them side by side,
I'm right.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.480
Anyway, I'm just worried
that I'm not going

17:02.522 --> 17:03.898
to be able to
understand our daughter.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.525
I mean, I can
barely understand you,

17:05.566 --> 17:08.444
and you can talk
and explain yourself.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.241
I'll interpret
for you, babe.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.661
I speak female girl.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.830
I know. Sometimes,
you never stop.

See, right there...

17:20.957 --> 17:22.542
That is...

17:22.583 --> 17:26.086
I don't want
to accidentally, uh,
say stuff like that

17:26.128 --> 17:27.547
to our little girl.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.173
Look, honey, you'll learn.

You've gotten
way better with me.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.720

When we first
started dating,

17:33.761 --> 17:37.015
you took me
to Shea stadium to see
four Met games in a row.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.224
Yeah, I know.
In the fourth game,

17:38.265 --> 17:39.475
in the bottom of the 13th,
you made us leave.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.228

17:42.269 --> 17:44.146
and I had a job interview
the next morning.

And the Mets won
in the 16th,
and we missed it...

17:45.523 --> 17:47.149
Okay, can we just
not argue about this
right now?

17:47.191 --> 17:48.943
Fine.
We'll hit that later.

17:48.985 --> 17:52.030

you got way better
at that kind of stuff.

I should sign up for it.
