00:03.159 --> 00:05.147
911. What's your emergency?

00:05.227 --> 00:09.085
Yes, hello.
I think there's someone in our house.

00:09.165 --> 00:12.521
Okay, ma'am, I need you to stay calm.
What's your address?

00:12.601 --> 00:15.825
Um, 3242 Milton Avenue.

00:15.905 --> 00:18.393
Police are on their way.
I need you to stay on the phone with me.

00:18.473 --> 00:20.762
Yes, please, please hurry. You have to hurry.

00:20.842 --> 00:23.032
Ma'am, did you say there's someone
in your house right now?

00:23.112 --> 00:24.800
Yes, yes, yes.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.069
Are you able to get out of the house?

00:27.149 --> 00:30.573
No, no, no. We're locked in, I think.

00:32.921 --> 00:35.110
My husband... My husband is gone.

00:35.190 --> 00:37.479
Ma'am, ma'am, slow down.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.182
Ma'am, slow down, gone where?

00:39.262 --> 00:41.116
Oh, God!

00:41.196 --> 00:42.818
Oh, God! Michael!

00:42.898 --> 00:44.186
Ma'am, can you hear me?

00:45.166 --> 00:46.455
Get off!

00:47.102 --> 00:49.192
Ma'am.

00:49.272 --> 00:52.494
Ma'am, can you hear me?

00:52.574 --> 00:54.095
Ma'am?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:36.745 --> 02:38.781
Tell me you love me.

02:42.017 --> 02:44.053
Tell me you love me.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.598
- I'm kind of surprised.
- You got the tickets?

03:09.678 --> 03:11.667
- Yes.
- Okay.

03:11.747 --> 03:15.751
Oh, really, Marley, are you kidding me?

03:17.153 --> 03:20.842
I think it's okay. Stay out of school today.

03:20.922 --> 03:22.745
Okay.

03:22.825 --> 03:25.014
Okay, it's ready. Got everything else?

03:25.094 --> 03:28.832
Good, you have the tickets? Grab that bag.

03:30.031 --> 03:31.968
All right, come on, guys. Get the bags.

03:34.003 --> 03:36.806
Or they don't...
They don't let us on the plane.

03:38.074 --> 03:41.163
Just screwing around.
This is called traveling.

03:41.243 --> 03:43.680
Okay, Marley? I don't know what that is.

07:32.675 --> 07:34.229
I got it. It's filming.

07:34.309 --> 07:36.565
So, Dad...

07:36.645 --> 07:38.832
Where are we going?

07:40.249 --> 07:42.104
That's a really good answer,
Dad. Thanks for...

07:42.184 --> 07:45.188
- Are you filming?
- Yes, I told you!

07:49.725 --> 07:53.549
I guess this new leopard print top

07:53.629 --> 07:57.133
and this bright blue watch is...

08:03.988 --> 08:06.444
Looks like a red carpet.

08:06.524 --> 08:09.431
Who... What are you wearing?

08:09.511 --> 08:11.332
- It's his fault.
- Whose fault is that?

08:11.412 --> 08:15.570
Dad, look. Look at this.

08:36.270 --> 08:37.339
Your mom!

09:54.849 --> 09:57.152
Home sweet home, right?

10:03.425 --> 10:07.181
I don't know about you, but I need
a vacation after that vacation.

10:07.261 --> 10:09.651
Marley, can you please
get off your phone for 10 minutes?

10:09.731 --> 10:10.686
I challenge you.

10:10.766 --> 10:13.421
Stop nagging me.

10:13.501 --> 10:14.422
What the hell?

10:14.502 --> 10:16.024
Back home.

10:16.104 --> 10:17.692
What is there to text about now?

10:17.772 --> 10:19.628
No, Mom!

10:19.708 --> 10:21.243
What?

10:24.246 --> 10:26.502
Oh, my God!

10:26.582 --> 10:27.769
Aaron!

10:27.849 --> 10:29.037
- What?
- Shit.

10:29.117 --> 10:31.253
Max, don't touch anything.

10:33.588 --> 10:35.491
Are you kidding me?

10:36.525 --> 10:39.127
Marley, Marley, please.

10:40.561 --> 10:43.218
- You guys wait outside.
- I'll call the police.

10:43.298 --> 10:45.653
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm just gonna check.

10:45.733 --> 10:47.321
- Be careful, okay?
- Keep 'em outside, all right?

10:47.401 --> 10:48.322
Okay.

10:48.402 --> 10:52.127
Um, hello?

10:52.207 --> 10:54.363
Uh, we've been broken into.

10:54.443 --> 11:00.402
It's 4161 Oak Tree Avenue.

11:00.482 --> 11:02.104
They came in through the kitchen window.

11:02.184 --> 11:03.839
They came in through the kitchen window.

11:03.919 --> 11:06.108
Baby, can you go outside for me, please?

11:06.188 --> 11:07.508
Someone's been in my room, I swear to God.

11:07.588 --> 11:09.610
- Okay.
- What's that noise?

11:09.690 --> 11:11.379
It's all right.

11:11.459 --> 11:12.513
Ha... Um, so...

11:12.593 --> 11:13.715
Hello?

11:13.795 --> 11:15.283
Hang on one second, please.

11:15.363 --> 11:18.353
What if someone's still up there? Shit.

11:18.433 --> 11:23.459
Um, how long before someone gets here?

11:23.539 --> 11:25.694
Okay. Okay, thank you.

11:25.774 --> 11:27.428
They're on their way!

11:27.508 --> 11:30.498
They said they'd be here in like two minutes.

11:39.854 --> 11:42.344
Did they go in my room?

11:42.424 --> 11:45.361
It's all right, it's just the TV.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.532
Unbelievable.

11:55.203 --> 11:57.173
You okay?

12:09.382 --> 12:11.572
What's it like up there?

12:11.652 --> 12:12.622
Uh...

12:14.223 --> 12:15.511
Dad!

12:15.591 --> 12:17.460
Yeah, it's fine!

12:23.232 --> 12:24.900
Stay outside!

12:51.727 --> 12:53.295
Hello?

12:56.732 --> 12:58.668
I've got a gun.

13:28.697 --> 13:29.665
Aaron?

13:31.833 --> 13:33.921
Police are here!

13:34.001 --> 13:35.737
Yeah, coming!

13:57.659 --> 14:00.315
- Well, the house is clear.
- You're sure?

14:00.395 --> 14:03.619
Oh, yeah. Ketchup is what he used
to draw that thing in the shower.

14:03.699 --> 14:05.753
- And you checked the attic?
- Yeah, it's all clear.

14:05.833 --> 14:07.589
We're starting to get that more and more.

14:07.669 --> 14:10.691
Yeah, what they do is they break into your
vehicle and then they hit "home" on your GPS.

14:10.771 --> 14:13.527
And now they know you're out of town,
they know where you live.

14:13.607 --> 14:15.397
Uh, look, it's probably just a vagrant

14:15.477 --> 14:18.800
looking for a place to sleep for a few
nights or a bunch of kids looking to party.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.283
Right. That's what is seems.

14:21.949 --> 14:23.451
- Ninja!
- Stop.

14:27.021 --> 14:28.476
Ninja!

14:28.556 --> 14:30.745
- Okay?
- Great, thank you, guys.

14:30.825 --> 14:32.761
Thank you very much.

14:34.529 --> 14:35.917
Um, one more thing.

14:35.997 --> 14:38.987
I didn't want to say anything
in front of my wife.

14:39.067 --> 14:42.291
But, uh, you know, I get the break-in part,

14:42.371 --> 14:43.792
but the mannequin?

14:43.872 --> 14:46.728
- I mean, somebody rigged that.
- I don't know.

14:46.808 --> 14:49.665
You know anybody who's looking
to scare you or anything?

14:49.745 --> 14:50.766
No, no.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.969
It's probably just somebody doing a joke.

14:54.049 --> 14:55.936
That's a sick sense of humor.

14:56.016 --> 14:58.306
- Well, you have a good day, sir.
- Yeah, okay, you too.

14:58.386 --> 15:00.723
- Take care.
- Thanks, officers.

15:05.093 --> 15:09.564
Uh, yeah, I'm calling about, uh,
to get an alarm system inst...

15:12.767 --> 15:15.523
Well, that's just completely torn.

15:15.603 --> 15:17.559
I don't want to keep that.

15:17.639 --> 15:18.560
Shut up.

15:37.825 --> 15:39.114
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi.

15:39.194 --> 15:42.484
- How you doing?
- Good.

15:42.564 --> 15:45.454
- Escaping the world?
- Yeah.

15:45.534 --> 15:48.022
Mm, you know what's going on?

15:48.102 --> 15:49.590
Yeah.

15:49.670 --> 15:51.926
Could you put that on pause for a second?

15:52.006 --> 15:53.729
Thank you.

15:53.809 --> 15:54.995
What's going on?

15:55.075 --> 15:56.565
Someone broke in?

15:56.645 --> 16:00.869
Yeah, somebody broke in, but, uh...

16:00.949 --> 16:06.141
You know, they're gone now
and... everything's safe.

16:06.221 --> 16:09.543
- Get that?
- Mm-hmm.

16:09.623 --> 16:10.512
You okay?

16:10.592 --> 16:13.882
No problem. Are you okay?

16:15.229 --> 16:18.099
Yeah, I'm okay. Play your video game.

16:23.604 --> 16:25.560
- Dad.
- Yeah, baby. What's up?

16:25.640 --> 16:26.894
- Um...
- You okay?

16:26.974 --> 16:30.031
Yeah. Did you go in my room?

16:30.111 --> 16:31.666
Uh, yeah, I had to shut off the TV.

16:31.746 --> 16:32.901
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:32.981 --> 16:35.170
But you didn't, you didn't like see anything?

16:35.250 --> 16:38.606
No. No, I just... No, I was
in there for like a half-second.

16:38.686 --> 16:41.856
I just has to shut off the TV,
and then I came out.

16:43.891 --> 16:44.926
You okay?

16:56.872 --> 16:59.860
No, yeah, he didn't take anything.

16:59.940 --> 17:01.562
Yeah. It's just like...

17:01.642 --> 17:04.065
someone's been living here or something.

17:04.145 --> 17:06.468
It's super creepy.

17:06.548 --> 17:09.503
Oh, my God, she's freaking out.

17:09.584 --> 17:12.507
I know, it's ridiculous.

17:12.587 --> 17:14.075
She's such a drama queen.

17:14.155 --> 17:16.478
I'm going to take our little
friend here down to the trash.

17:16.558 --> 17:18.646
You want me to put this stuff in the wash?

17:18.726 --> 17:22.049
No. You know what? We need to burn them.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.219
Sounds like a good idea.

17:24.299 --> 17:26.054
Yeah, I'm going to wash this bed set.

17:26.134 --> 17:30.905
It doesn't look like they've
been touched, but even so.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.829
You all right?

17:34.909 --> 17:38.232
He slept in our bed.

17:38.312 --> 17:41.670
He ate our food and...

17:41.750 --> 17:43.853
he went through everything.

17:45.119 --> 17:47.843
It's all right.

17:47.923 --> 17:51.011
It's all right. Just a crappy day.

17:51.091 --> 17:54.850
We just need to clean up.
I already talked to Miguel.

17:54.930 --> 17:56.518
He's going to come tomorrow morning.

17:56.598 --> 18:00.989
- He's going to fix the window.
- Oh, good.

18:01.069 --> 18:05.974
Do you think maybe,
maybe we should stay in a hotel?

18:07.876 --> 18:11.165
No, I don't think that. We can't afford it.

18:11.245 --> 18:13.000
We just spent two weeks in a hotel.

18:13.080 --> 18:17.638
Sweetheart, this is our home.
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

18:18.219 --> 18:20.741
This is our home, okay?

18:20.821 --> 18:22.277
It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

18:22.357 --> 18:25.113
You have to think about it like...

18:25.193 --> 18:30.050
You know, we just had some,
some really inconsiderate houseguests.

18:30.130 --> 18:31.252
Okay?

18:31.332 --> 18:32.988
My hands, Dad.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.089
Suddenly you don't know where the forks are?

18:35.169 --> 18:36.624
Yummy.

18:36.704 --> 18:38.773
Now I'm definitely not going
to get you a fork.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.864
Baby, you're just freaking yourself out.

18:43.944 --> 18:46.214
Would you stop reading that stuff?

18:49.717 --> 18:52.007
Did you know your daughter has a vibrator?

18:52.087 --> 18:53.708
No. What?

18:53.788 --> 18:58.279
Yeah, I saw it when I was in her room,
shutting off her TV.

18:58.359 --> 18:59.780
Oh, my God.

18:59.860 --> 19:02.017
- I know.
- Does she know you know?

19:02.097 --> 19:04.152
' Cause she'll be really embarrassed.

19:04.232 --> 19:06.887
I don't know. She asked me
if I saw anything, and I said no.

19:06.967 --> 19:08.656
But...

19:10.004 --> 19:12.661
I kind of feel like she wanted
to talk to me, which is fine.

19:12.741 --> 19:14.629
I mean, I'm happy to talk to her.

19:14.709 --> 19:16.765
She doesn't want to talk to you about that.

19:16.845 --> 19:20.249
Okay, well, fine,
I won't talk to her about it either.

21:13.494 --> 21:15.150
Mom!

21:15.230 --> 21:16.799
Yeah?

21:18.299 --> 21:20.154
Coming!

21:20.234 --> 21:23.038
- You want me to go or...
- It's okay.

21:29.144 --> 21:30.998
Hey, sweetheart.

21:31.078 --> 21:33.667
Oh, my God, what's the matter?

21:34.515 --> 21:39.908
What's happening? Did you have a bad dream?

21:39.988 --> 21:42.610
I have bad dreams sometimes too.

21:44.259 --> 21:47.281
Shh, shh.

21:47.361 --> 21:49.497
Okay, you have some water.

21:52.032 --> 21:56.191
You're all right.
I hate bad dreams, don't you?

21:56.271 --> 21:58.206
Yeah, me too.

22:01.341 --> 22:03.444
Ah, see?

22:31.071 --> 22:33.094
Baby, you know where my black bag is?

22:33.174 --> 22:35.997
No. Did you get up in the night?

22:36.077 --> 22:38.814
- What's that?
- Did you get up in the night?

22:40.315 --> 22:43.337
Oh, found it.

22:43.417 --> 22:45.105
- Did I get up in the night?
- Yeah.

22:45.185 --> 22:47.107
What, are you monitoring
my toilet habits now?

22:47.187 --> 22:48.843
Did you come down here?

22:48.923 --> 22:52.514
Uh, I don't know. I don't think so. No. Why?

22:52.594 --> 22:56.017
Because the juice was out on the counter.

22:56.097 --> 22:58.886
Okay, well, maybe somebody
left it out last night.

22:58.966 --> 23:00.921
No, because I cleaned the place,
top to bottom.

23:01.001 --> 23:05.460
Baby, nobody broke into our house
to drink our orange juice.

23:05.540 --> 23:07.528
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

23:07.608 --> 23:09.364
Do you have to go to work today?

23:09.444 --> 23:12.499
After a two-week vacation?
Yes, I do, unfortunately. Why?

23:12.579 --> 23:15.435
The kids have got school,
and my class got moved 'till tomorrow,

23:15.515 --> 23:17.505
I thought maybe we could hang out.

23:17.585 --> 23:20.107
Aw, that sounds fun.

23:20.187 --> 23:23.545
I'm still a bit freaked out here on my own.

23:23.625 --> 23:25.880
Oh, yeah. Well, Miguel's coming.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.982
He'll be here in like an hour.
You love Miguel.

23:29.062 --> 23:31.219
- Hey, buddy, how'd you sleep?
- Good.

23:31.299 --> 23:32.867
Good.

23:38.973 --> 23:41.863
What time are you back tonight?

23:41.943 --> 23:45.900
Um, I'm going to try to get back as early
as I can, but I got so much to catch up on.

23:45.980 --> 23:48.036
Aha-ha!

23:48.116 --> 23:51.520
Guess we can close the case
of the orange juice mystery.

23:53.620 --> 23:55.857
- Love you.
- Have a good day.

26:25.173 --> 26:26.326
Hola, it's Miguel!

26:29.409 --> 26:31.231
Miguel, Jesus, that gave me a fright!

26:31.311 --> 26:33.334
Oh, I'm so sorry! Mr. Mellor
said you wanted window locks.

26:33.414 --> 26:34.669
I was just checking the fittings.

26:34.749 --> 26:36.571
- Ah, yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

26:36.651 --> 26:38.206
- Thanks.
- No problem.

26:38.286 --> 26:40.173
Sorry about the break-in.
I heard about the break-in.

26:40.253 --> 26:41.689
Oh, I know. It's a nightmare.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.781
I don't know. All right.

26:47.861 --> 26:50.450
I don't even want to think about it.

26:51.866 --> 26:53.755
- Beth?
- Hang on a second, Melissa.

26:53.835 --> 26:55.189
Yeah, sorry!

26:55.269 --> 26:57.357
The doors and windows are all done.

26:57.437 --> 26:59.460
- Right.
- And if it's okay with you,

26:59.540 --> 27:02.063
I'd like to finish up tomorrow,
the patio doors.

27:02.143 --> 27:03.530
Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:03.610 --> 27:06.034
Um, would you take a look
at the upstairs toilet?

27:06.114 --> 27:08.236
- It's flushing by itself.
- No problem.

27:08.316 --> 27:10.604
Brilliant. Um, and can you
take one of the keys?

27:10.684 --> 27:13.221
Because I've got class tomorrow.
You have to let yourself...

28:29.262 --> 28:30.817
Are you okay?

28:30.897 --> 28:33.901
I just need a glass of water.

30:04.791 --> 30:06.493
Jesus!

30:10.298 --> 30:12.519
We have a serial offender.

30:12.599 --> 30:13.587
What's that? Oh.

30:13.667 --> 30:16.370
No, you know what?
Actually this may have been me.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.013
Mrs. Mellor?

30:53.040 --> 30:55.609
What the heck is this thing?

33:26.126 --> 33:28.114
Hey, this is the Mellors.

33:28.194 --> 33:31.184
Please leave a message, and we'll
get back to you as soon as we can.

33:31.264 --> 33:32.853
Thanks so much.

33:32.933 --> 33:34.989
Hey, Beth. Melissa.

33:35.069 --> 33:38.124
Just seeing if you were around
to grab a coffee today.

33:38.204 --> 33:40.428
Hey. This is me.

33:40.508 --> 33:42.997
I just got in the door.

33:43.077 --> 33:44.765
Uh, they're, uh...

33:44.845 --> 33:46.901
they're a mixed bag.

33:46.981 --> 33:49.470
Yeah, some of them are, well...

33:49.550 --> 33:51.572
Yeah, got more problems than others.

33:51.652 --> 33:56.143
Uh, oh, I can't right now 'cause
the kids are going to be home soon.

33:56.223 --> 34:00.480
I'm free tomorrow though. Want to meet then?

34:00.560 --> 34:02.783
Okay, cool. I'll call you.

34:02.863 --> 34:05.052
I'll call you in the morning. Okay, thanks.

34:05.132 --> 34:06.835
Take care, bye.

36:05.785 --> 36:07.140
Jesus Christ, Marley!

36:07.220 --> 36:08.808
- Holy shit, Mom!
- Oh, my God!

36:08.888 --> 36:11.345
- You really frightened me.
- Uh, yeah.

36:11.425 --> 36:13.047
What are you... What were you doing up there?

36:13.127 --> 36:15.015
And why do you have stockings?

36:15.095 --> 36:17.183
Nothing, I just thought
I heard something, but...

36:17.263 --> 36:18.785
- Yeah.
- It doesn't matter.

36:18.865 --> 36:21.020
It wasn't anything. How was school?

36:21.100 --> 36:23.056
- Fine.
- Where's your brother?

36:23.136 --> 36:25.158
Uh, raiding the cereal, I think.

36:25.238 --> 36:26.292
Oh, my God.

36:26.372 --> 36:28.062
- You okay?
- Yeah.

36:28.142 --> 36:30.997
I don't know what the matter with me is.

36:31.077 --> 36:33.133
I'm really jumpy.

36:36.249 --> 36:38.305
Wow. It sounds like
you were really freaked out.

36:38.385 --> 36:40.808
- Yeah, I was.
- Yeah, I would have been...

36:40.888 --> 36:43.243
I would have been freaked out too.

36:43.323 --> 36:45.044
That's scary, babe.

36:45.124 --> 36:47.214
And then Marley came.

36:47.294 --> 36:49.748
I screamed at her!

36:54.401 --> 36:56.022
Do you know what I was thinking though?

36:56.102 --> 36:59.941
- What's that?
- I think we should get a gun.

37:01.307 --> 37:05.064
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:05.144 --> 37:08.167
Wow.

37:08.247 --> 37:11.939
Can't get a gun every time a lightbulb blows.

37:12.019 --> 37:15.022
You know how I feel about guns, right?

37:16.890 --> 37:20.180
I just don't feel safe here anymore.

37:20.260 --> 37:22.816
Yeah, uh...

37:22.896 --> 37:24.218
You think I'm being silly, don't you?

37:24.298 --> 37:25.652
No, of course... No,

37:25.732 --> 37:29.156
I just, you know, I just worry.

37:29.236 --> 37:30.938
With the kids and...

37:32.039 --> 37:33.893
- It's all right.
- You know what?

37:33.973 --> 37:37.230
No. I that's what you need to feel safe,

37:37.310 --> 37:39.767
we will get a gun.

37:39.847 --> 37:41.134
Thank you.

37:41.214 --> 37:44.171
I'll get one tomorrow. Want to watch some TV?

37:44.251 --> 37:46.053
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:21.287 --> 38:24.124
Max, Marley, time to go!

38:27.861 --> 38:29.183
I got the mail for you, Dad.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.984
Really? What, are you vying
for a higher allowance?

38:32.064 --> 38:34.888
Just trying to be a good daughter.

38:34.968 --> 38:36.489
What did you do with the vase?

38:36.569 --> 38:39.259
What's that?

38:39.339 --> 38:41.442
What did you do with the vase?

38:42.975 --> 38:45.979
Report card successfully intercepted.

38:50.050 --> 38:52.439
- Come on, Marley!
- I'm coming!

38:52.819 --> 38:55.042
Move on with my life.

38:56.122 --> 38:58.946
Yeah. Okay, I got to go.
I'll see you at school.

38:59.026 --> 39:01.948
- Did you move the vase?
- No.

39:02.028 --> 39:04.017
Maybe Miguel took it. He was here.

39:04.097 --> 39:05.118
Why would he take it?

39:05.198 --> 39:07.855
You guys are so racist.

39:07.935 --> 39:10.991
No, I... I'm not racist.

39:11.071 --> 39:13.026
- Come on, Max.
- Go.

39:13.106 --> 39:15.877
You don't think I'm racist, do you?

39:25.484 --> 39:28.075
Well, hurry up. We are so late now.

39:28.155 --> 39:30.490
Mom, it's fine!

39:41.435 --> 39:43.524
I'm gonna wait in the car!
The key's in the door!

39:43.604 --> 39:45.906
Oh, my God!

40:03.122 --> 40:04.210
So here it is.

40:04.290 --> 40:07.848
I set the code for two...

40:07.928 --> 40:09.149
two, four, six, right?

40:09.229 --> 40:12.185
- Two, four, six.
- Two, four, six.

40:12.265 --> 40:14.087
Right.

40:14.167 --> 40:17.256
There it is. You want to hold it or...

40:17.336 --> 40:18.859
No, no, no.

40:18.939 --> 40:22.095
- Okay, well, it is loaded.
- Okay.

40:22.175 --> 40:24.198
Extra ammunition there.

40:25.611 --> 40:29.002
- Okay.
- Okay? So let's...

40:29.082 --> 40:31.853
hide it somewhere and never look at it again.

42:57.363 --> 42:59.685
Okay, I'll see you later.

42:59.765 --> 43:01.221
Make sure you're back by 10:30.

43:01.301 --> 43:02.254
Yeah, Mom, I know.

43:02.334 --> 43:04.991
- Say hi to Colin.
- Okay, Mom.

43:05.071 --> 43:07.207
- Okay.
- Yeah.

43:15.414 --> 43:18.705
Jesus fucking Christ.
I told you not to go up here.

43:18.785 --> 43:21.055
If my dad's here...

43:25.124 --> 43:26.393
Hey...

43:57.490 --> 44:02.681
So my parents are going out
of town this weekend.

44:02.761 --> 44:06.520
I'm going to have the house all to myself.

44:06.600 --> 44:09.156
So if you want to sleep over...

44:09.236 --> 44:11.424
My curfew's at 10:30.

44:11.504 --> 44:15.495
Just tell them you're going to Carly's house.

44:15.575 --> 44:17.444
Okay.

44:27.486 --> 44:28.607
- Stop!
- What?

44:28.687 --> 44:30.276
I think...

44:30.356 --> 44:33.359
I think there's someone filming us.

44:38.231 --> 44:41.120
Hey, just...
Let's just get out of here, okay?

44:41.200 --> 44:43.355
- No, I'm going to talk to him.
- No, stop. What?

44:43.435 --> 44:46.803
- No, I just wanna talk to him.
- Come on!

44:51.343 --> 44:53.732
Hey, buddy.

44:53.812 --> 44:57.035
Sir, we can see you. Um...

44:59.218 --> 45:02.555
Hey, you're really freaking out
my girlfriend, so...

45:04.290 --> 45:07.346
Cops patrol this area all the time.

45:15.368 --> 45:18.506
All right, babe, let's...
No, let's get out of here.

45:21.908 --> 45:24.663
I'm calling the cops!

46:26.305 --> 46:28.194
- Hello, come in!
- Hey.

46:28.274 --> 46:31.297
Hi, guys! How are you?

46:31.377 --> 46:34.433
- Good. What's up, buddy?
- Very good, thank you.

46:34.513 --> 46:36.502
Ooh, thank you very much.

46:39.452 --> 46:41.941
- Ohh!
- Nice little color.

46:44.857 --> 46:47.547
- You like that?
- Ah, I love it.

46:47.627 --> 46:51.750
Vanilla fragrance from, uh...
from work, you know?

46:51.830 --> 46:53.620
Cheers!

46:53.700 --> 46:57.524
- How's work, Meliss?
- Mmm, it's great actually.

46:57.604 --> 46:59.491
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I, uh...

46:59.571 --> 47:01.828
I think I'm gonna get a promotion soon.

47:01.908 --> 47:04.497
She has her boss in her pocket.

47:04.577 --> 47:06.765
He kind of likes her, you know.

47:06.845 --> 47:09.803
- I gotta play the game.
- She's good at it.

47:09.883 --> 47:12.872
Yeah. Do what you got to do.

47:24.798 --> 47:26.986
They're like literally the best of friends.

47:27.066 --> 47:29.823
They could not be closer at this point and...

47:29.903 --> 47:31.457
But it was cute. It was...

47:31.537 --> 47:35.328
It was, uh, encouraging. She was confident.

47:35.408 --> 47:38.297
Yeah, she's like, she's a cool girl.

47:38.377 --> 47:41.033
She doesn't like me, but...

47:41.113 --> 47:43.937
Or her, but she's a cool girl.

47:44.017 --> 47:45.805
You have to let her go.

47:45.885 --> 47:47.873
- No!
- Not yet!

47:47.953 --> 47:49.875
She's still young, but...

47:49.955 --> 47:51.544
It makes me just hold onto Max.

47:51.624 --> 47:53.013
She's womanly.

47:53.093 --> 47:55.281
- What?
- It's that time.

47:55.361 --> 47:57.850
Please don't call my daughter "womanly."

47:57.930 --> 48:00.553
What do you want me to call her, "baby girl"?

48:00.633 --> 48:02.756
Call her "baby girl." That's what I prefer.

48:02.836 --> 48:04.758
She's your baby girl!

48:04.838 --> 48:06.526
We were that way.

48:06.606 --> 48:10.363
I have this... I gotta show you
this picture. It's...

48:10.443 --> 48:15.067
First of all, I got to tell you my wife
here looked so beautiful on this day.

48:15.147 --> 48:17.569
I think she was...
I got to show you this picture.

48:17.649 --> 48:20.339
There was this, you know,
it's very difficult to get.

48:20.419 --> 48:21.875
She looks beautiful now, by the way.

48:21.955 --> 48:23.442
Yes, indeed, yes, indeed.

48:23.522 --> 48:25.745
It's very difficult to get her off.

48:25.825 --> 48:27.913
It's very difficult
to get Marley off the phone,

48:27.993 --> 48:31.618
so every picture is... Here it is.

48:31.698 --> 48:33.319
Let me see.

48:33.399 --> 48:36.455
Every picture she's just
in between the texts.

48:36.535 --> 48:38.991
Oh, yep.

48:39.071 --> 48:41.941
Yeah. "Dad, do we have to?"

48:53.819 --> 48:54.973
They listen to me that much.

48:55.053 --> 48:56.875
- Mom?
- She listens to you more.

48:56.955 --> 49:00.379
Mom! Mom!

49:00.459 --> 49:01.915
Mom!

49:01.995 --> 49:03.616
Coming!

49:05.899 --> 49:06.986
You okay, sweetheart?

49:07.066 --> 49:08.922
Can you stop banging on the roof?

49:09.002 --> 49:12.926
We're not banging on the roof.
Are we making too much noise?

49:13.006 --> 49:15.060
Did you have a...

49:15.140 --> 49:17.964
Oh, what's that?

49:18.044 --> 49:19.431
I don't know.

49:19.511 --> 49:22.569
Did you spill something? It's all wet.

49:22.649 --> 49:25.672
- Did you have an accident?
- No.

49:25.752 --> 49:28.040
Okay, sweetheart, let me
just get you back into bed.

49:28.120 --> 49:33.011
So you think it's like a "daddy-like" thing
that she's trying to... Yeah, I know.

49:33.091 --> 49:35.547
Max just peed in the hall.

49:35.627 --> 49:37.884
- Where?
- Just outside his room.

49:37.964 --> 49:41.488
Max just peed on the floor
just outside his room.

49:41.568 --> 49:44.504
Yeah, I'm just gonna clear it up.
It won't be a minute.

50:03.122 --> 50:05.011
- Baby.
- Mm-hmm?

50:05.091 --> 50:07.113
Come to bed.

50:07.193 --> 50:09.047
You look so pretty.

50:19.606 --> 50:22.095
What's got into you?

50:22.175 --> 50:24.897
About five or six glasses of wine.

50:30.015 --> 50:31.937
What's that?

50:32.017 --> 50:33.753
I don't know.

50:38.191 --> 50:40.814
It's Marley's report card.

50:40.894 --> 50:43.216
Yeah?

50:43.296 --> 50:46.553
She's failing math.

50:46.633 --> 50:48.555
Really?

50:48.635 --> 50:52.459
Huh.

50:52.539 --> 50:54.928
How'd it get into our bed?

50:55.008 --> 50:56.830
- You little shit!
- Marley...

50:56.910 --> 50:58.163
We're not speak... Marley!

50:58.243 --> 51:00.232
We're not finished talking to you!

51:00.312 --> 51:04.002
Don't ever, never touch my stuff!

51:04.082 --> 51:05.171
You little shit!

51:05.251 --> 51:07.140
Hey, hey, easy, easy, easy.

51:07.220 --> 51:09.209
What? You're raising a pervert!

51:09.289 --> 51:13.526
Stop it. It's not okay, Marley.

51:15.060 --> 51:17.649
Max? Are you... Are you okay?

51:17.729 --> 51:19.785
Now, you can't take things that aren't yours,

51:19.865 --> 51:21.221
and you cannot forge
other people's signatures.

51:21.301 --> 51:22.855
I didn't forge any signatures.

51:22.935 --> 51:25.558
- No, but you were going to.
- How do you know that?

51:25.638 --> 51:27.493
Now I'm being punished
for something I didn't even do?

51:27.573 --> 51:30.096
What is this, Minority Report?

51:30.176 --> 51:31.897
This is so unfair!

51:31.977 --> 51:35.033
Well, you know what?
Sometimes being a kid sucks.

51:35.113 --> 51:37.904
I'm not a kid!

51:37.984 --> 51:38.937
Okay.

51:39.017 --> 51:41.120
I hate you!

51:44.022 --> 51:45.745
Marley!

51:45.825 --> 51:48.662
Let her cool off. She'll be fine.

51:50.263 --> 51:53.018
- I didn't go into her stupid room!
- Max, you're not in trouble.

51:53.098 --> 51:55.288
I'm just saying, you know,
you can't go in there again.

51:55.368 --> 51:57.189
- Dad?
- Yeah.

51:57.269 --> 51:59.572
What's a pervert?

52:01.908 --> 52:03.143
Um, it's...

52:20.392 --> 52:21.980
Hi. How was your day?

52:22.060 --> 52:24.149
It was fine. I have to go pack for Carly's.

52:24.229 --> 52:26.185
- Uh, Max, sweetheart.
- Yeah?

52:26.265 --> 52:27.754
Can I have a quick word with you?

52:27.834 --> 52:29.022
Yeah.

52:29.102 --> 52:31.290
- Um, how was your day?
- Good.

52:31.370 --> 52:33.892
- You have a good day at school?
- Yeah. Am I in trouble?

52:33.972 --> 52:35.861
No, no, you're not in trouble at all.

52:35.941 --> 52:38.297
I just wanted to ask you something.

52:38.377 --> 52:42.234
I was cleaning your room earlier,
and I found this picture.

52:42.314 --> 52:43.937
It's really cool.

52:44.017 --> 52:45.238
Oh, that's Jimmy.

52:45.318 --> 52:46.939
Who's Jimmy?

52:47.019 --> 52:48.975
He was in my dream.

52:49.055 --> 52:50.676
Uh-huh. Do you want some water?

52:50.756 --> 52:51.710
Sure.

52:51.790 --> 52:53.245
And what did he do in your dream?

52:53.325 --> 52:54.980
We just talked.

52:55.060 --> 52:56.783
What'd you talk about?

52:56.863 --> 52:58.116
I don't know.

52:58.196 --> 53:01.087
Oh, he said that he doesn't
think that Melissa

53:01.167 --> 53:05.290
is as nice as you think she is.

53:05.370 --> 53:06.792
What, my friend Melissa?

53:06.872 --> 53:07.974
Yeah.

53:11.343 --> 53:14.600
Did he say anything else?

53:14.680 --> 53:15.816
Mm-mm.

53:17.816 --> 53:21.687
That's really strange.
I wonder why he spoke about Melissa.

53:23.055 --> 53:25.277
Um, remember,
you were going to Sam's tonight,

53:25.357 --> 53:28.680
so don't eat too much.

53:28.760 --> 53:30.183
Do you want to go get your stuff together?

53:30.263 --> 53:32.732
- Yeah.
- Good boy.

53:35.001 --> 53:39.292
So Max is heaving dreams about strange men

53:39.372 --> 53:41.660
talking to him about Melissa.

53:41.740 --> 53:43.830
Baby, that kid's gonna need so much therapy,

53:43.910 --> 53:45.931
You think you're gonna be able
to hook him up with a discount?

53:46.011 --> 53:47.933
There's a pretty good chance
he saw his sister's vibrator

53:48.013 --> 53:50.803
when he was on his little
fact-finding mission.

53:50.883 --> 53:53.438
I thought you were gonna
stop thinking about that.

53:53.818 --> 53:56.542
The vibrator? I would love to, believe me.

53:57.390 --> 53:59.979
Oh, beautiful. Baby, you look so good.

54:00.059 --> 54:01.214
Oh, thank you.

54:01.294 --> 54:02.714
- You ready?
- Yeah.

54:02.794 --> 54:05.183
All right. You made reservations, right?

54:05.263 --> 54:08.888
I did, yeah. You sure you want to go?

54:08.968 --> 54:10.736
Yes, I want to go.

55:32.517 --> 55:35.789
But it was definitely...

55:40.493 --> 55:42.381
You hear that?

55:42.461 --> 55:43.997
What?

55:45.298 --> 55:47.419
Silence.

55:48.533 --> 55:51.790
Why did we have kids?

55:51.870 --> 55:54.774
It's such a beautiful sound.

56:01.847 --> 56:04.470
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna get some wine.

56:04.550 --> 56:06.471
Uh, uh, ah, that wine is for me.

56:06.551 --> 56:08.373
I can't have the wine?

56:08.453 --> 56:12.078
That's for when you're at work late,
and I'm at home on my own.

56:12.158 --> 56:13.279
You don't want any wine?

56:13.359 --> 56:16.062
Mm-mm. We don't need wine.

56:17.162 --> 56:18.850
No, we don't. Fuck wine.

57:34.206 --> 57:37.062
A new Italian restaurant?

57:38.209 --> 57:41.000
Stop it.

57:41.080 --> 57:42.549
You know, I'm blushing now.

57:44.617 --> 57:47.873
Um, well, he had a sleepover last night,

57:47.953 --> 57:50.375
so he went out like a light.

57:50.455 --> 57:53.011
Yeah, they were up late.

57:53.091 --> 57:57.350
And she's gone to the cinema.

57:57.430 --> 57:59.933
He's working late again.

01:00:01.252 --> 01:00:02.788
Baby?

01:00:10.428 --> 01:00:12.097
Baby?

01:00:20.238 --> 01:00:21.640
Sweetheart?

01:01:22.167 --> 01:01:24.169
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:01:26.171 --> 01:01:28.694
Wow.

01:01:28.774 --> 01:01:30.229
What time is it?

01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:32.330
- It's almost 9:30.
- Oh, my God.

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:35.167
Yeah, you were out like a light.

01:01:35.247 --> 01:01:38.203
I swear to God I wasn't drunk.

01:01:38.283 --> 01:01:41.239
Maybe you're coming down with something.

01:01:41.319 --> 01:01:42.774
I feel fine.

01:01:42.854 --> 01:01:46.645
Maybe I was just really tired.
Thanks for this.

01:01:46.725 --> 01:01:49.114
Maybe you're pregnant.

01:01:49.194 --> 01:01:53.118
- See?
- Don't even joke.

01:01:53.198 --> 01:01:55.587
- Is anything good?
- Just junk.

01:01:55.667 --> 01:01:59.125
I've been waiting for an invoice from Miguel.

01:01:59.205 --> 01:02:00.593
Yeah, I still haven't gotten that.

01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:02.861
Just fine by me.

01:02:02.941 --> 01:02:04.430
Let's do something fun today.

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:06.332
Okay.

01:02:06.412 --> 01:02:08.734
- Let's go, guys!
- Come on, kids, let's go!

01:02:08.814 --> 01:02:11.570
The harbor's not gonna wait all day!

01:02:13.385 --> 01:02:15.441
I'm hungry for one of them
hot dogs wrapped in...

01:02:15.521 --> 01:02:17.243
Marley, your shoelace is undone.

01:02:17.323 --> 01:02:18.477
I'll get it later.

01:02:18.557 --> 01:02:21.247
- What are you wearing?
- It's tasty.

01:02:21.327 --> 01:02:24.482
My harbor hat! Give me my harbor hat back.

01:02:24.562 --> 01:02:27.285
- You're such a loser.
- You're a loser.

01:02:27.365 --> 01:02:30.522
This hat has been with me
through good and bad times.

01:02:30.602 --> 01:02:33.173
This predates all of you!

01:04:11.802 --> 01:04:13.692
- Remember that swing set?
- Yeah.

01:04:13.772 --> 01:04:16.294
Some kid like broke his face.

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:17.895
- Broke his face?
- Yeah.

01:04:17.975 --> 01:04:20.299
Okay, I don't care. Can we just eat?

01:04:20.379 --> 01:04:22.533
- Can we just eat, Dad?
- Why do we ever go on vacation?

01:04:22.613 --> 01:04:25.638
Is this not better than any vacation?

01:04:25.718 --> 01:04:27.006
England was so nice.

01:04:27.086 --> 01:04:29.441
Oh, England! He wants to see Grandma.

01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:31.709
Why would you want to see Grandma?

01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:32.910
- Hey!
- She's like...

01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:34.779
Well, they both smell.

01:04:36.259 --> 01:04:38.115
Marley!

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:40.518
Don't! I'm gonna call 911!

01:04:40.598 --> 01:04:43.689
That is not okay. That is not okay.

01:05:40.691 --> 01:05:43.614
- Are you serious?
- Of course I'm serious.

01:05:43.694 --> 01:05:45.917
What do you mean, of course you're serious?

01:05:45.997 --> 01:05:48.553
You want to be safe too, right?

01:05:48.633 --> 01:05:52.104
Well, sure, but who says
I want to do it at all?

01:05:54.205 --> 01:05:57.495
It was kind of implied when you said
you wanted to sleep over.

01:05:57.575 --> 01:05:59.430
I never said I wanted to sleep over.

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:01.466
You asked if I would sleep over,
and I said sure.

01:06:01.546 --> 01:06:03.067
Babe, it's not that big of a deal.

01:06:03.147 --> 01:06:06.605
It kind of is a big deal as we've
never had this conversation before,

01:06:06.685 --> 01:06:08.140
and now you're just kind of bringing it up.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.875
And you're just assuming like...
Do you ever think?

01:06:10.955 --> 01:06:14.446
- What do you want me to say?
- Well, I don't know.

01:06:14.526 --> 01:06:17.850
Like ask me if I'm ready to do that
before you just assume.

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:19.432
God damn!

01:06:22.167 --> 01:06:24.703
You're taking this the wrong way.

01:06:26.104 --> 01:06:28.526
I don't want to make you upset.

01:06:28.606 --> 01:06:30.162
Just go.

01:06:30.242 --> 01:06:32.577
Jesus Christ, just go.

01:07:12.283 --> 01:07:15.473
Hey, man, I don't know what...

01:07:15.553 --> 01:07:16.655
Look...

01:07:33.972 --> 01:07:36.508
Colin, are you in here?

01:07:39.644 --> 01:07:41.146
Fine.

01:07:47.919 --> 01:07:50.490
I wanted to apologize.

01:09:31.256 --> 01:09:33.310
Hey, it's me. Um...

01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:37.149
Give me a call when you get this, okay?

01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:38.863
Bye.

01:10:58.976 --> 01:11:02.234
Hey, sweetheart.

01:11:02.314 --> 01:11:04.816
Are you okay?

01:11:06.752 --> 01:11:08.954
What's the matter?

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.363
You still thinking about your dream?

01:11:20.998 --> 01:11:24.035
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

01:11:27.038 --> 01:11:29.241
Who said that?

01:11:32.043 --> 01:11:34.399
You can tell me anything.

01:11:34.479 --> 01:11:36.981
I can't say anything.

01:11:38.883 --> 01:11:40.852
It's okay.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.297
Jimmy saw Daddy kissing Melissa.

01:12:24.995 --> 01:12:26.498
Baby?

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.502
Beth?

01:12:32.137 --> 01:12:33.859
Hey, I've been trying to get ahold of you.

01:12:33.939 --> 01:12:35.494
You don't have your phone on you?

01:12:35.574 --> 01:12:37.963
I got your message. What's up?
The kids all right?

01:12:38.043 --> 01:12:41.199
Yeah, they're with their friends.

01:12:41.279 --> 01:12:44.802
Okay, what's going on? You're scaring me.

01:12:44.882 --> 01:12:47.485
I found that in your shirt.

01:12:48.619 --> 01:12:52.910
We haven't used condoms for years.

01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:54.378
Baby, really?

01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:57.149
I swear that's not my cond...
I've never seen that before.

01:12:57.229 --> 01:13:01.052
Maybe, maybe some of the kids
or Timmy at work.

01:13:01.132 --> 01:13:03.120
- I really want to believe you.
- Baby, believe me.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.156
Are you kidding me?
Why would I... You think I...

01:13:05.236 --> 01:13:06.357
I love you.

01:13:06.437 --> 01:13:09.026
- Hey!
- What about that?

01:13:09.106 --> 01:13:12.511
What about... It's my shirt. What...

01:13:13.611 --> 01:13:15.199
Are you kidding me? What is this?

01:13:15.279 --> 01:13:17.201
It's her lipstick and perfume.

01:13:17.281 --> 01:13:20.204
I really spent all afternoon
just sitting here thinking,

01:13:20.284 --> 01:13:23.842
"How could you do this?
We have such a nice life."

01:13:23.922 --> 01:13:27.012
- I would not do this.
- What have I done wrong?

01:13:27.092 --> 01:13:29.079
You have not done nothing wrong.
I love you so much.

01:13:29.159 --> 01:13:31.482
Would you stop it and look at me, please?

01:13:31.562 --> 01:13:34.052
Would you look at me
into my eyes before you...

01:13:34.132 --> 01:13:35.986
Hey, hey!

01:13:36.066 --> 01:13:38.056
I promise you I am not cheating.

01:13:38.136 --> 01:13:41.293
I swear to you, I am not cheating on you.

01:13:41.373 --> 01:13:42.593
I prom... Why would I do that, baby?

01:13:42.673 --> 01:13:45.931
- I love you so much.
- I don't know.

01:13:46.011 --> 01:13:47.097
I'm not!

01:13:47.177 --> 01:13:49.133
Max saw you.

01:13:49.213 --> 01:13:52.169
Max saw me what?

01:13:52.249 --> 01:13:54.271
You told him not to say anything to me.

01:13:54.351 --> 01:13:55.841
How could you do that?

01:13:55.921 --> 01:13:58.375
I didn't say... What are you talking about?

01:13:58.455 --> 01:14:02.180
Max saw you kissing Melissa!

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:04.249
You think I'm having an affair with Melissa?

01:14:04.329 --> 01:14:06.484
- Baby, are you serious?
- What did you do to the door?

01:14:06.564 --> 01:14:09.620
Stop it for a second.
Just look at me. Baby, look at me.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:13.225
I swear to you,
I am not having an affair, okay?

01:14:13.305 --> 01:14:15.226
Where's the door handle?

01:14:15.306 --> 01:14:18.363
I don't kno... I don't know.

01:14:20.678 --> 01:14:22.967
What's that?

01:14:23.047 --> 01:14:24.636
- Hello?
- The kids aren't home?

01:14:24.716 --> 01:14:25.904
No.

01:14:25.984 --> 01:14:29.053
Hello? Who's up there?

01:14:33.591 --> 01:14:35.526
Call the police.

01:14:36.727 --> 01:14:39.183
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

01:14:39.263 --> 01:14:40.185
Call the police, baby.

01:14:40.265 --> 01:14:42.453
I'm coming with you.

01:14:53.011 --> 01:14:56.133
There's someone in our attic.
Call the police.

01:14:56.213 --> 01:14:57.615
Oh, my God.

01:14:58.749 --> 01:15:00.618
What are you doing?

01:15:01.753 --> 01:15:02.908
What are you doing?

01:15:02.988 --> 01:15:05.409
I'm gonna take care of this.

01:15:05.489 --> 01:15:06.824
Um, shit.

01:15:10.695 --> 01:15:12.049
- I don't think you should...
- Stay here.

01:15:12.129 --> 01:15:13.517
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:15:13.597 --> 01:15:16.253
Um... yeah.

01:15:16.333 --> 01:15:17.655
I've got a gun!

01:15:17.735 --> 01:15:19.223
There's an intruder in our house.

01:15:19.303 --> 01:15:23.328
It's, um, it's 4161 Oak Tree Avenue.

01:15:23.408 --> 01:15:25.262
I have a gun! I'm coming up there!

01:15:25.342 --> 01:15:28.232
Come as quick as you can!

01:15:28.312 --> 01:15:31.335
Do you see anyone up there?

01:15:31.415 --> 01:15:34.004
Aaron?

01:15:34.084 --> 01:15:37.441
No, it doesn't look like
there's anybody up here.

01:15:37.521 --> 01:15:39.710
Hello?

01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:43.080
No, we're, we're good.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.085
Oh, my God! Aaron! Aaron, what's going on?

01:16:10.454 --> 01:16:12.276
Aaron?

01:16:27.771 --> 01:16:29.648
Stay away from me!

01:16:34.479 --> 01:16:35.713
I'm gonna shoot!

01:17:14.452 --> 01:17:17.655
I promise you I'm not cheating.

01:17:19.524 --> 01:17:21.546
No, please, no!

01:17:21.626 --> 01:17:26.116
I swear to you, I'm not cheating on you.

01:17:26.196 --> 01:17:29.721
Why would I do that, baby?
I love you so much.

01:17:36.607 --> 01:17:38.744
Look at me.

01:17:42.346 --> 01:17:44.182
Tell me you love me.

01:17:48.552 --> 01:17:50.855
Tell me you love me.

01:17:52.623 --> 01:17:54.193
I love you.

01:18:20.351 --> 01:18:21.939
I love you.

01:18:27.257 --> 01:18:28.359
I love you.

01:18:34.298 --> 01:18:36.019
I love you.
