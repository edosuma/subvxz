I'VE SEEN PANTS
BUNCH UP BEFORE.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.433
THIS IS LIKE A FIVE INCH
BUNCH-UP I GOT HERE.

00:44.467 --> 00:45.800
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO PLAY WITH IT.

00:45.833 --> 00:46.900
IS IT A BAD THING ?

00:46.933 --> 00:48.933
MAYBE IT'S NOT
SUCH A BAD THING,
YOU KNOW ?

00:48.967 --> 00:50.333
BECAUSE YOU WANT
PEOPLE TO THINK

00:50.367 --> 00:51.633
THAT YOU CONSTANTLY
HAVE AN ERECTION ?

00:51.667 --> 00:54.400
IS IT A BAD THING FOR ME
TO WALK AROUND LIKE THAT ?

00:54.433 --> 00:55.400
YEAH, IT IS.

00:55.433 --> 00:56.400
I GOT A TENT.

00:56.433 --> 00:57.400
IT'S A BIG ONE.

DO IT EVERY MONDAY.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.800
YES, I DO.

01:11.833 --> 01:13.733
I DON'T HAVE
ANYBODY TO GO WITH.

01:13.767 --> 01:16.500
GO BY YOURSELF.

01:16.533 --> 01:18.067

02:06.400 --> 02:07.800
HE COULD'VE INVITED ME
TO GO ALONG WITH HIM.

02:07.833 --> 02:09.233
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

02:09.267 --> 02:10.567

05:01.367 --> 05:03.767
SHE'S SITTING ON THE AISLE,

05:03.800 --> 05:06.267

A LEISURELY DINNER,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.767
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ?
LEISURELY ?

06:45.800 --> 06:47.633
WELL, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
TWO AND 20 HOURS.

06:47.667 --> 06:48.767
I DON'T KNOW.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.167
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, LEISURELY.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.500
I LOVE YOU,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.500

07:09.967 --> 07:11.700
HEY !
HEY !

07:11.733 --> 07:12.800
HOW WAS
THE MOVIE ?

07:12.833 --> 07:15.233
OH, NOT BAD.

07:15.267 --> 07:18.167
SO, NOT QUITE SURE
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS,

07:18.200 --> 07:22.600
BUT I THINK
YOUR FRIEND NANCY

07:22.633 --> 07:24.867
THINKS SHE GOT ME AROUSED
IN THE MOVIE.

07:24.900 --> 07:28.067
WHY WOULD
SHE THINK THAT ?

07:28.100 --> 07:31.067
BECAUSE OF
THE TENT IN THE PANTS,
AND SHE LOOKED DOWN.

07:31.067 --> 07:32.067
NO.

07:32.067 --> 07:33.067
YEAH.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.067
NO.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.133
YEAH.

07:35.167 --> 07:37.567
SHE THOUGHT THAT
THERE WAS SOME GARBAGE THERE.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.533
SHE LOOKED OVER

07:39.567 --> 07:40.600
AND SHE LOOKED
AT YOUR CROTCH ?

07:40.633 --> 07:41.600
SHE LOOKED AT IT.

07:41.633 --> 07:42.600
SHE LOOKED AT IT.

07:42.633 --> 07:43.600
SHE LOOKED DOWN.

07:43.633 --> 07:44.733
WHAT WAS
HER REACTION ?

07:47.567 --> 07:48.600
LIKE IT
WAS AWKWARD.

07:48.633 --> 07:50.267
THERE WAS
A LITTLE TWINKLE, YEAH.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.267
YOU'RE SURE
THAT SHE LOOKED OVER

07:52.300 --> 07:54.200
AND THOUGHT
THAT YOU WERE EXCITED ?

07:54.233 --> 07:55.233
90% SURE.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.467
CAN'T BE 100% SURE,
I'M 90% SURE.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.767
THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.067
IT'S VERY CREEPY.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.500
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THESE PANTS !

08:04.533 --> 08:05.867
I KNOW,
IT'S JUST MATERIAL.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.667
IT'S OBVIOUS--

08:07.700 --> 08:09.100
IT'S NOT OBVIOUS !

08:09.133 --> 08:11.767
LOOK, LOOK !

08:11.800 --> 08:14.100
SO, SHE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT IT ?

08:14.133 --> 08:15.100
YOU DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING--

08:15.133 --> 08:17.567
NO, THERE WAS NO TIME,
THE MOVIE STARTED.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.067
AND YOU WEREN'T.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.233
WHAT ?

08:20.267 --> 08:22.767
YOU WEREN AROUSED.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.800
NO, LOOK AT THIS !

08:23.833 --> 08:24.800
I'M JUST
MAKING SURE.

08:24.833 --> 08:25.900
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THESE PANTS !

08:25.933 --> 08:28.200
BUT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME,
YOU SCOFFED.

08:28.233 --> 08:30.867
BECAUSE ANY IDIOT COULD TELL
THAT WAS JUST MATERIAL.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.400
SHE'S YOUR FRIEND.

08:32.433 --> 08:35.533
WELL...

08:35.567 --> 08:38.300
MAYBE I'LL CALL HER.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.067
NO, NO, NO.

08:40.067 --> 08:42.333
NO, DON'T DO THAT,
THAT'S CRAZY.

08:42.367 --> 08:45.833
OH, BY THE WAY, I'VE GOT
SOME MORE NEWS, TOO.

08:45.867 --> 08:48.067
YOU KNOW, IN CASE THIS
WASN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU.

08:48.067 --> 08:49.833
WE'RE NOT GOING OUT TO DINNER
WITH RICHARD LEWIS

08:49.867 --> 08:51.333
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND
ON SATURDAY NIGHT.

08:51.367 --> 08:52.333
THAT'S OUT.

08:52.367 --> 08:54.267
WHY ?

08:54.300 --> 08:57.433
UM, I GOT IN A FIGHT
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND...

08:57.467 --> 09:00.567
BEFORE THE MOVIE
STARTED.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.400
LARRY, WHY ?

09:02.433 --> 09:04.100
HOW IN THE WORLD
COULD YOU GET IN A FIGHT
WITH RICHARD'S--

09:04.133 --> 09:05.400
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

09:05.433 --> 09:07.767
I WAS TRYING TO GET TO MY SEAT
AND SHE WOULDN'T LET ME GO,

09:07.800 --> 09:10.533
AND, WE GOT--
HE WASN'T THERE.

09:10.567 --> 09:13.133
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT,
I JUST HAVE TO
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

09:13.167 --> 09:16.700
OH, UM, JEFF CALLED AND
LEFT A MESSAGE ON THE MACHINE.

09:16.733 --> 09:19.233
AND HE SAID
THAT HE'S SORRY.

09:21.567 --> 09:22.933
WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN ?

09:22.967 --> 09:24.200
I DON'T KNOW.

09:24.233 --> 09:26.100
IF HE LEAVES A MESSAGE
SAYING HE'S SORRY,

09:26.133 --> 09:27.100
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS ?

09:27.133 --> 09:29.067
HE'S SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ?

09:29.067 --> 09:31.733
YEAH, LIKE YOU KNEW,
YOU WOULD KNOW
WHAT THAT MESSAGE MEANT.

09:31.767 --> 09:33.167
WHAT HAPPENED ?

09:33.200 --> 09:34.567
THAT'S WEIRD,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.767
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED ?

09:35.800 --> 09:36.767
NO.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.067
HE WOULD JUST
LEAVE A MESSAGE SAYING--

09:38.100 --> 09:39.100
I'M THINKING
ABOUT IT.

09:39.133 --> 09:40.800
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.200
I'LL TALK TO HIM
TOMORROW.

09:44.567 --> 09:45.700
STRANGE NIGHT, HUH ?

09:45.733 --> 09:46.967
YEAH,
VERY STRANGE.

09:51.400 --> 09:54.867
* OH DE OH

09:54.900 --> 09:59.067
* OH DE OH...

09:59.067 --> 10:01.967
HELLO ?
YEAH.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.700
UM, DO YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH LONGER HE'S GONNA BE ?

10:05.733 --> 10:07.333
OKAY.

10:08.367 --> 10:11.167
SO, IT WAS
REALLY UNCOOL

10:11.200 --> 10:12.733
TO JUST LEAVE THAT MESSAGE,
"I'M SORRY", ON MY MACHINE,

10:12.767 --> 10:13.900
'CAUSE MY WIFE...

10:13.933 --> 10:16.367
YOU KNOW, SHE ASKED ME,
"WHAT IS HE SORRY ABOUT ?"

10:16.400 --> 10:17.800
AND I HAD
NO ANSWER.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.300
OH, I'M SORRY.

10:19.333 --> 10:20.900
I'M NOT GONNA SAY
THAT I CALLED HER "HITLER",

10:20.933 --> 10:23.200
AND YOUR PARENTS
HEARD IT IN THE CAR.

10:23.233 --> 10:24.200
NO.

10:24.233 --> 10:25.933
HELLO ?

10:25.967 --> 10:27.567
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I'M JUST GONNA CALL BACK.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.833
OKAY ?

10:28.867 --> 10:32.100
AND THE THING IS,
SHE'S GONNA ASK ME AGAIN.

10:32.133 --> 10:35.333
WELL, WE'LL
THINK OF SOMETHING.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN',
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING ?

10:37.500 --> 10:40.200
I'M WRITING KATHY GRIFFIN
A LETTER OF APOLOGY.

10:40.233 --> 10:42.133
WHY ?
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

10:42.167 --> 10:43.567
WE DID NOTHING
TO EACH OTHER,

10:43.600 --> 10:46.067
BUT JUST EVERY WEEK I END UP
WRITING HER AN APOLOGY LETTER.

10:46.100 --> 10:49.000
WHAT A JOB
YOU HAVE.

10:49.033 --> 10:50.167
YOU HAVE TO
WRITE PEOPLE LETTERS ?

10:50.200 --> 10:51.167
I KNOW.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.167
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.500
IT'S CRAZY.

10:53.533 --> 10:54.500
KATHY GRIFFIN'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

10:54.533 --> 10:57.067
WHAT IF KATHY GRIFFIN
CALLED YOU UP

10:57.100 --> 10:59.467
AND SAID THAT SHE WANTED ME
TO WRITE A PILOT FOR HER,

10:59.500 --> 11:01.433
AND YOU SAID,

11:01.467 --> 11:03.167
NO, I WASN'T AVAILABLE,
WITHOUT CONSULTING ME.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.400
MM-HMM.

11:04.433 --> 11:07.267
IF MY WIFE EVER ASKS ME AGAIN,
WHICH I'M SURE SHE WILL,

11:07.300 --> 11:08.567
THAT'S WHAT
I COULD TELL HER.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.700
THAT'S WHY YOU SAID
YOU WERE SORRY.

11:10.733 --> 11:12.167
GREAT, GREAT,
WONDERFUL.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.167
YOU LIKE THAT ?

11:13.200 --> 11:14.300
YES,
VERY MUCH.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.367
YEAH, IT'S QUITE GOOD,
ISN'T IT ?

11:15.400 --> 11:16.367
SO, WE'RE
LYING TOGETHER.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.600
YEAH.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.733
SO THAT'S OUR STORY, IN CASE
MY WIFE EVER TALKS TO YOU,

11:19.767 --> 11:21.133
KATHY GRIFFIN...

11:21.167 --> 11:22.600
"YEAH, KATHY GRIFFIN
CALLED HIM UP,

11:22.633 --> 11:27.100
"AND, UH, HE SAID I COULDN'T
WRITE THE PILOT FOR HER.

11:27.133 --> 11:28.167
"WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.567
HE'S AN IDIOT,
HE'S AN IDIOT."

11:29.600 --> 11:30.767
WHO IS ?

11:30.800 --> 11:31.767
YOU ARE,
I'M TALKING TO MY WIFE NOW.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.500
"HE'S A BIG,
FAT IDIOT."

11:34.533 --> 11:36.067
BIG, FAT IDIOT ?

11:36.067 --> 11:37.967
TELL YOUR WIFE
I'M AN IDIOT.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.267
DON'T SAY
I'M A FAT IDIOT.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.800
I'M KIDDING.

11:40.833 --> 11:41.800
COULD YOU
DO ME A FAVOR ?

11:41.833 --> 11:42.967
WRITE ME
A LETTER OF APOLOGY.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.433
I WILL.

11:44.467 --> 11:46.400
FOR CALLING ME
A FAT IDIOT, LISTEN.

11:46.433 --> 11:48.067
THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN
YOU CALLED YOUR WIFE "HITLER" ?

11:48.067 --> 11:49.333
MY PARENTS, YOU KNOW,
WERE IN THE BACK ?

11:49.367 --> 11:52.433
WE HAD A GAY COUSIN
THAT ESCAPED NAZI GERMANY,

11:52.467 --> 11:54.733
SO MY PARENTS ARE
VERY SENSITIVE TO IT.

11:54.767 --> 11:56.567
TALK ABOUT
BEING OSTRACIZED.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.567
WELL, YEAH.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.267
GAY JEW
IN NAZI GERMANY ?

11:59.300 --> 12:00.600
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

12:00.633 --> 12:02.300
HE MUST HAVE
HAD A HARD TIME.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.300
YEP.

12:03.333 --> 12:04.767
WHAT A COMBO.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.933
LISTEN, CAN YOU
DO ME A FAVOR ?

12:05.967 --> 12:07.900
PLEASE, THIS AFTERNOON,
COME BY THE HOUSE

12:07.933 --> 12:10.200
AND, APOLOGIZE
TO MY PARENTS.

12:10.233 --> 12:12.067
IT'S FOR ME,
THEY'RE HERE FOR ANOTHER WEEK.

12:12.067 --> 12:14.167
MY FATHER WANTS ME
TO DROP YOU AS A CLIENT !

12:14.200 --> 12:15.400
HE KEEPS ON
TELLING ME EVERYDAY.

12:15.433 --> 12:16.867
"DROP HIM,
DROP HIM AS A CLIENT !"

12:16.900 --> 12:19.833
BECAUSE OF ONE STUPID,
LITTLE JOKE I MADE IN THE CAR ?

12:19.867 --> 12:21.167
ONE STUPID,
LITTLE THING.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.500
BECAUSE OF
THE GAY JEW COUSIN ?

12:23.533 --> 12:25.100
THEY'RE VERY
SENSITIVE ABOUT IT...

12:25.133 --> 12:27.067
OF THE GAY JEW COUSIN.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.467
I GOTTA GO
MEET THEM FOR LUNCH.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.500
I'LL BE HOME THIS AFTERNOON,
PLEASE, PLEASE COME BY.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.067
DON'T EVER PUT ME ON THAT
SPEAKER PHONE AGAIN

12:34.067 --> 12:35.167
IN YOUR CAR
IF ANYBODY'S SITTING THERE,

12:35.200 --> 12:36.167
EVER AGAIN !

12:36.200 --> 12:37.167
IF I'M BY MYSELF
IT'S OKAY.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.333
YEAH !

12:38.367 --> 12:39.800
OKAY, BUT CAN YOU
DO ME A FAVOR, PLEASE ?

12:39.833 --> 12:42.067
TELL MY PARENTS
YOU'RE SORRY.

12:42.067 --> 12:45.167
QUICKLY ZIP IN, ZIP OUT,
AND TELL THEM, ALRIGHT ?

12:49.800 --> 12:51.167
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THIS NEW RESTAURANT

12:51.200 --> 12:52.200
CALLED
"MAMA'S BOY" ?

12:52.233 --> 12:53.233
YEAH, I HEARD
IT'S GREAT.

12:53.267 --> 12:54.233
OH, YEAH ?

12:54.267 --> 12:55.533
YEAH.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.800
OH, GOOD, CHERYL AND I ARE
GOING ON SATURDAY NIGHT.

12:56.833 --> 12:57.900
WE HAVE
RESERVATIONS.

12:57.933 --> 12:59.533
WITH LEWIS
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND ?

12:59.567 --> 13:02.233
NO, WE WERE SUPPOSED TO,
BUT THAT FELL THROUGH.

13:02.267 --> 13:03.567
I SHOULD TAKE
MY PARENTS THERE.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.300
YOU SHOULD.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.433
"MAMA'S BOY."

13:11.900 --> 13:13.733
( whistling )

13:13.767 --> 13:16.667
NOBODY IS GONNA WANNA SEE
HER ON ANOTHER AWARDS SHOW.

13:16.700 --> 13:19.067
NO, OKAY,
I GOTTA GO.

13:19.067 --> 13:20.067
ALRIGHT, BYE.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.500
HI.

13:21.533 --> 13:22.500
DID RICHARD LEWIS CALL ?

13:22.533 --> 13:23.900
YES, AND
HE'S COMING OVER.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.133
OH.

13:25.167 --> 13:28.167
SO, IT'LL PROBABLY BE
A FEW MINUTES FROM NOW.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.500
UM, BOB SHAW
CALLED.

13:30.533 --> 13:32.633
HE JUST WANTED
TO SAY HI.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.067
AND YOUR WIFE
CALLED TWICE.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.967
OKAY, I DON'T
NEED THAT.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.233
Q-TIPS ?
OKAY.

13:38.267 --> 13:40.300
YEAH, I'M WRITING
IT DOWN.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.200
A COLOR WRAP.

13:42.233 --> 13:44.700
IS THAT TIN FOIL
OR PLASTIC ?

13:44.733 --> 13:47.067
IS THAT
SARAN WRAP ?

13:47.067 --> 13:49.067
NO, I DON'T KNOW.

13:49.067 --> 13:51.800
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT, OKAY.

13:51.833 --> 13:54.467
UH, YES, AS A MATTER
OF FACT I DID.

13:54.500 --> 13:59.567
UM, WHAT HAPPENED WAS
KATHY GRIFFIN HAD CALLED HIM

13:59.600 --> 14:03.867
( knocking )
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY
OF ME WRITING A PILOT FOR HER.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.067
SHE WAS INTERESTED IN ME
WRITING A PILOT FOR HER,

14:06.067 --> 14:07.133
AND HE NEVER
TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

14:07.167 --> 14:08.833
HE JUST SAID NO
WITHOUT TELLING ME.

14:08.867 --> 14:11.700
SO, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID
HE WAS SORRY ABOUT.

14:11.733 --> 14:14.133
( banging )

14:14.167 --> 14:16.533
OKAY, YEAH,
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.333
OKAY, BYE.

14:21.167 --> 14:23.067
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT FOR ?

14:23.067 --> 14:25.633
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN MARRIED,
AND I THINK I'M IN LOVE,

14:25.667 --> 14:27.200
AND I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
RUINED THIS FOR ME.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.200
COME ON,
"RUINED IT."

14:28.233 --> 14:31.367
IF I DID, I DID YOU A FAVOR,
BY THE WAY.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.900
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST
INSENSITIVE THINGS
YOU HAVE EVER SAID.

14:33.933 --> 14:36.100
I DON'T THINK IT'S INSENSITIVE,
I THINK IT'S SENSITIVE.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.233
I THINK IT'S SENSITIVE,
I DON'T, I DO.

14:38.267 --> 14:39.600
LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

14:39.633 --> 14:41.933
NOW THIS IS A WOMAN
WHO KNOWS SEVEN LANGUAGES.

14:41.967 --> 14:43.167
SHE'S VERY SWEET.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.067
I'M TAKING A LEAK,
THE MOVIE'S ABOUT TO START.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.067
LOOK AT ME,
CAN YOU RESPECT-- ?

14:47.067 --> 14:49.600
I DROVE DOWN
IN RUSH HOUR.

14:49.633 --> 14:51.300
AND THOSE SEATS
ARE LIKE THIS.

14:51.333 --> 14:53.233
SHE TRIED.
SHE DIDN'T TRY.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.667
"DO YOU MIND ?!

14:54.700 --> 14:56.467
CAN'T YOU MOVE ?!"

14:56.500 --> 14:58.200
AND THEN,
HERE'S THE COUP DE GRAS,

14:58.233 --> 15:00.667
YOU LOOK
AT HER BREASTS !

15:00.700 --> 15:03.067
YOU'RE LOOKING AT
MY GIRLFRIEND'S BREASTS !

15:03.067 --> 15:04.367
THEY'RE NOT BREASTS,

15:04.400 --> 15:07.067
THEY'RE JUST BIG
CHEMICAL BALLS, OKAY ?

15:07.067 --> 15:08.067
THEY'RE NOT BREASTS.

15:08.067 --> 15:09.067
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THEY'RE FAKE ?

15:09.067 --> 15:10.500
I COULD
TAKE A GUESS.

15:10.533 --> 15:12.700
SO, MAYBE THEY ARE FAKE,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ?

15:12.733 --> 15:14.200
NOTHING,
DON'T CALL THEM BREASTS,
THEY'RE NOT BREASTS.

15:14.233 --> 15:15.867
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M GETTING--

15:15.900 --> 15:18.533
I HAVE THAT
IRREGULAR HEART THING,
AND THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.367
I'M A RECOVERING
ALCOHOLIC.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.800
THIS IS
ALL VERY BAD FOR ME.

15:21.833 --> 15:22.800
WE'RE DOING
THE LITANY NOW ?

15:22.833 --> 15:23.800
WHAT ELSE ?

15:23.833 --> 15:25.367
I CAN GIVE YOU
THE LITANY.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.733
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT MY CHOLESTEROL WAS ?

15:27.767 --> 15:29.267
272, ALRIGHT ?

15:29.300 --> 15:30.933
SO, I DON'T
NEED THIS SHIT, MAN.

15:30.967 --> 15:32.400
I'VE KNOWN HER
FOR SIX WEEKS.

15:32.433 --> 15:34.067
WE'VE ALREADY
HAD INTERCOURSE.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.200
SHE'S LOVING,
SHE SPEAKS SEVEN LANGUAGES.

15:36.233 --> 15:38.067
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE INTERCOURSE.

15:38.067 --> 15:41.067
AND I HAPPEN TO BE A LITTLE BIT
IN LOVE WITH HER, OKAY ?

15:41.067 --> 15:43.767
WELL, A LITTLE BIT SHOULD BE
THE OPERATIVE WORD HERE.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.067
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET--

15:45.100 --> 15:46.600
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NONE
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.

15:46.633 --> 15:47.600
'CAUSE YOU'RE
THE MOST INSENSITIVE--

15:47.633 --> 15:48.833
DOES SHE ASK YOU
TO GO OVER

15:48.867 --> 15:51.200
SOME OF THE NEIL SIMON
SCRIPTS AT NIGHT ?

15:51.233 --> 15:52.500
THE ACTRESS ?

15:52.533 --> 15:55.200
MAKE YOU DO SOME READINGS
AT NIGHT WITH HER IN BED ?

15:55.233 --> 15:57.067
DOES SHE
GIVE YOU A SCRIPT

15:57.067 --> 15:59.400
AND GO OVER THE LINES
WITH YOU ON THE SIDES ?

15:59.433 --> 16:00.667
DO YOU READ
THE SIDES WITH HER ?

16:00.700 --> 16:02.900
SHE READS WYZELL,
SHE READS A LOT OF THINGS.

16:02.933 --> 16:03.933
SHE READS WYZELL ?

16:03.967 --> 16:05.067
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.633
NOT EVERYONE'S A MORON
I GO OUT WITH.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.067
YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE SHOULD BE READING ?

16:08.100 --> 16:09.767
EMILY FUCKING POST !

16:09.800 --> 16:11.333
THAT'S WHAT
SHE SHOULD BE READING !

16:11.367 --> 16:12.367
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, LARRY.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.267
LISTEN, SATURDAY NIGHT,
DO ME A FAVOR.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.067
I LOVE YOU,
ALRIGHT ?

16:16.067 --> 16:19.067
WE HAVE ENOUGH GOOD STUFF
IN THE BANK TO GET OVER THIS.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.367
BUT SATURDAY NIGHT AT DINNER,
COULD WE MAYBE,

16:21.400 --> 16:23.367
MAYBE TRY TO HAVE
AN APOLOGY FOR THIS ?

16:23.400 --> 16:25.833
FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN HAVE DINNER WITH YOU
ON SATURDAY NIGHT.

16:25.867 --> 16:26.833
THAT'S OUT.

16:26.867 --> 16:27.933
AM I HEARING THIS ?

16:27.967 --> 16:29.200
I'M NOT HAVING
DINNER.

16:29.233 --> 16:30.533
OUR RELATIONSHIP'S
AT STAKE RIGHT NOW.

16:30.567 --> 16:31.633
OUR RELATIONSHIP'S
AT STAKE.

16:31.667 --> 16:32.633
GET OUT OF HERE !

16:32.667 --> 16:34.133

BY SUNDOWN ?

16:38.067 --> 16:39.067
WHAT'S-- ?

16:39.067 --> 16:40.333
THAT'S FUNNY.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.567
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING NOT
TO LAUGH, BUT THAT'S FUNNY.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.067
YOU'D BETTER
CALL ME BY SUNDOWN.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.267
BY SUNDOWN ?

16:45.300 --> 16:47.200
AND IS A POSSE GONNA
COME GET ME ?

16:47.233 --> 16:48.667
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.833
( chattering )

16:52.867 --> 16:55.567
( female )
OH, THERE HE IS,
HI, 'LAR.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.633
SO, THESE ARE
MY FRIENDS,

16:57.667 --> 16:59.067
CONNIE AND ROBIN,
FROM "THE MOMMY
AND ME CLASS".

16:59.100 --> 17:00.133
OH, OKAY.

17:00.167 --> 17:01.333
( female )
I'M ONE OF
THE MOMMIES.

17:01.367 --> 17:04.700
HI, MOMMY, HI.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.900
( female )
ACTUALLY, LET'S GO UP
AND SEE THE KIDS.

17:06.933 --> 17:09.733
( Jeff )
MOM, DAD,
LARRY'S HERE.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.333
OH, REALLY ?

17:12.267 --> 17:14.433
HI, UM...

17:14.467 --> 17:17.300
I'VE COME TO
TELL YOU THAT,

17:17.333 --> 17:19.733
UM, I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

17:19.767 --> 17:20.867
AND I KNOW YOU
WERE IN THE CAR,

17:20.900 --> 17:22.967
AND YOU OVERHEARD ME
SAY SOMETHING ABOUT MY WIFE.

17:23.067 --> 17:25.200
WE WERE
IN THE CAR.

17:25.233 --> 17:26.800
I'M SORRY
IF I OFFENDED YOU,

17:26.833 --> 17:28.500
IT WAS MEANT
AS A JOKE,

17:28.533 --> 17:29.500
IT WASN'T VERY FUNNY,
OBVIOUSLY.

17:29.533 --> 17:30.500
IT WASN'T FUNNY.

17:30.533 --> 17:31.967
NO !

17:32.067 --> 17:34.467
I THOUGHT I WAS JUST
TALKING TO JEFF...

17:34.500 --> 17:36.133
YOU MEAN YOU CAN
SAY THAT KIND OF
THING TO JEFF,

17:36.167 --> 17:38.300
AND HE THINKS
IT'S FUNNY,

17:38.333 --> 17:39.867
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAY ?

17:39.900 --> 17:40.867
I'M NOT TRYING
TO SAY THAT.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.433
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S FUNNY.

17:42.467 --> 17:44.500
( Jeff )
I WOULD'VE TOLD HIM
IT WAS THE WRONG THING TO SAY.

17:44.533 --> 17:47.433
I THINK SO.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.267
I DON'T THINK MY WIFE
IS HITLER,

17:49.300 --> 17:50.833
I LOVE MY WIFE
VERY MUCH.

17:50.867 --> 17:52.100
SHE'S GIVEN UP
HER CAREER

17:52.133 --> 17:54.833
TO WORK FULL-TIME
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.267
SO, IT WAS AN ERROR
ON YOUR PART ?

17:57.300 --> 17:59.833
IT WAS CRUEL
AND NOT NICE.

17:59.867 --> 18:01.067
IT WAS ROTTEN,
IF I MAY SAY SO.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.067
IT WAS ROTTEN !

18:02.067 --> 18:05.167
IT WAS ROTTEN.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.400
I'M SORRY, I AGREE,
IT WAS ROTTEN.

18:07.433 --> 18:09.367
ALRIGHT,
IT'S OVER NOW.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.367
IT'S OVER,
WHAT YOU DID.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.700
YOU HAVE TO PULL
YOURSELF TOGETHER.

18:12.733 --> 18:16.300
I DO, I'M TRYING
TO PULL MYSELF TOGETHER.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.367
YOU HAVE TO GET
AHOLD OF YOURSELF.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.067
SO, YOU DID
WHAT YOU DID,

18:20.100 --> 18:21.533
AND, IT WASN'T
VERY NICE,

18:21.567 --> 18:24.400
BUT, I TRY TO BE
A NICE HUMAN BEING.

18:24.433 --> 18:26.067
FORGET ABOUT IT.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.333
AS LONG AS YOU
UNDERSTAND.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.267
( Jeff )
HE UNDERSTANDS,
HE'S GREAT.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.067
I'M DONE WITH
THE HITLER STUFF.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.067
YOU'RE
ALRIGHT.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.067
THANK YOU.

18:33.067 --> 18:34.300
YOU'VE COME IN
AND YOU SAID IT.

18:34.333 --> 18:36.133
AH, AH, AH,
EASY.

18:36.167 --> 18:37.433
( female )
MOM, DAD !

18:37.467 --> 18:39.300
SAMMY IS ASLEEP,
ON THE FLOOR,

18:39.333 --> 18:41.067
HE'S GOT HIS
ARM AROUND SARAH.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.067
IT'S THE CUTEST THING,
YOU GOTTA COME UP,

18:43.067 --> 18:44.067
RIGHT NOW.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.733
LARRY, COME,
IT'S SO CUTE.

18:45.767 --> 18:47.067
JEFFREY, GET
THE POLAROID, OKAY ?

18:47.067 --> 18:48.067
THE POLAROID...

18:48.067 --> 18:50.100
AND YOU CAN SEE
THE NEW WALLPAPER.

18:50.133 --> 18:52.333
( chattering )

18:52.367 --> 18:55.733
( Jeff )
THE POLAROID,
I'LL GET THE POLAROID.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.533
I'M NOT GONNA
GO UPSTAIRS.

18:57.567 --> 18:59.600
WHATEVER, YOU KNOW,
IT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

18:59.633 --> 19:01.133
YOU WANNA, YOU WANNA,
YOU DON'T, YOU DON'T.

19:01.167 --> 19:02.133
I CAN'T MAKE YOU.

19:02.167 --> 19:03.267
I GOTTA
GET MOVING.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.467
THANK YOU, THAT WAS
REALLY NICE OF YOU.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.133
I REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

19:06.167 --> 19:07.433
I GOTTA GO UP
THERE NOW.

19:18.433 --> 19:20.267
( Cheryl )
LARRY, LARRY,
COME HERE FOR A SECOND.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.433
UM, LOOK
WHO'S HERE.

19:22.467 --> 19:23.900
I JUST WANTED TO JUST
GET THIS OUT IN THE OPEN.

19:23.933 --> 19:24.900
WHAT THE HELL ?

19:24.933 --> 19:26.067
IT'S NANCY.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.067
AND, I JUST WANTED YOU
TO COME OVER HERE...

19:28.100 --> 19:29.233
COME OVER HERE
FOR ONE SECOND.

19:29.267 --> 19:31.833
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
JUST TALK ABOUT THIS.

19:31.867 --> 19:33.400
TELL HER WHAT YOU WERE
TELLING ME THE OTHER NIGHT.

19:33.433 --> 19:37.400
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS ?
THIS IS SILLY !

19:37.433 --> 19:39.767
TELL HER WHAT YOU
TOLD ME THE OTHER NIGHT.

19:42.133 --> 19:44.700
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT

19:44.733 --> 19:46.267
SHE'S TALKING TO YOU
ABOUT THIS !

19:46.300 --> 19:47.833
THIS IS INSANE !

19:47.867 --> 19:48.833
WAIT A SECOND,
WAIT A SECOND,

19:48.867 --> 19:49.967
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.067
CAN I JUST SAY
SOMETHING HERE ?

19:51.100 --> 19:53.533
OKAY...

19:53.567 --> 19:55.433
NOW, I CAME HOME,
AND I THOUGHT

19:55.467 --> 19:57.667
IT WAS REALLY FUNNY,

19:57.700 --> 20:00.700
IT WAS KIND OF
A JOKE TO ME THAT,

20:00.733 --> 20:04.133
YOU KNOW, THAT YOU
STARED DOWN, OVER HERE...

20:04.167 --> 20:05.600
BECAUSE YOU
HAD AN ERECTION.

20:05.633 --> 20:06.933
NANCY, THIS IS,

20:06.967 --> 20:09.100
THIS IS WHY
IT'S FUNNY,

20:09.133 --> 20:10.933
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
THAT I HAD AN ERECTION.

20:10.967 --> 20:12.267
I THOUGHT ?

20:12.300 --> 20:15.533
BUT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE "THOUGHT" PART.

20:15.567 --> 20:17.100
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE SAYING.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.600
EVEN BEFORE
THE MOVIE,

20:18.633 --> 20:20.400
LARRY SAID,
"LOOK AT THESE PANTS".

20:20.433 --> 20:21.800
I POINTED OUT
THE PANTS TO HER

20:21.833 --> 20:24.233
RIGHT BEFORE
THE MOVIE.

20:24.267 --> 20:26.833
LARRY, YOU SAT DOWN,
AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

20:26.867 --> 20:28.100
AND THEN I STARTED
RUBBING YOUR ARM,

20:28.133 --> 20:29.100
AND, YOU GOT
A HARD-ON.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.067
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL,
I DON'T CARE.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.567
NO, IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.067
AND I WOULDN'T MIND IT,
IF, IN FACT, I DID.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.067
WAIT A SECOND,
WAIT A SECOND.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.667
SHE WAS RUBBING
YOUR ARM ?

20:37.700 --> 20:39.500
WHY WERE YOU
RUBBING HIS ARM ?

20:39.533 --> 20:41.533
I WAS UPSET ABOUT
THE WOMAN...

20:41.567 --> 20:42.533
WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL ME

20:42.567 --> 20:43.533
THAT SHE WAS
RUBBING YOUR ARM ?

20:43.567 --> 20:44.533
I WAS UPSET
ABOUT THE WOMAN

20:44.567 --> 20:46.100
WHO WOULDN'T LET ME
INTO THE AISLE !

20:46.133 --> 20:47.433
WHY WOULDN'T
YOU TELL ME THAT

20:47.467 --> 20:49.233
WHEN YOU TOLD ME
THE STORY ?

20:49.267 --> 20:51.467
IT'S SO INSIGNIFICANT TO ME,
THE WHOLE THING !

20:51.500 --> 20:52.633
( Cheryl )
I'M TAKING IN
ALL THE FACTS.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.200
LISTEN, IT
HAPPENED, OKAY ?

20:54.233 --> 20:56.467
HE GOT AN ERECTION,
IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.300
NANCY, IT DIDN'T
HAPPEN, OKAY ?

20:59.333 --> 21:01.067
IF IT HAPPENED, I WOULD
GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR IT !

21:01.067 --> 21:02.200
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

21:02.233 --> 21:04.867
I KNOW, WHEN I GET THESE
THINGS AND HOW THEY HAPPEN.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.467
THESE THINGS,
THESE ERECTION THINGS ?!

21:07.500 --> 21:09.067
I KNOW
THE SOURCE.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.333
I KNOW THE SOURCE, TOO.

21:10.367 --> 21:11.333
YEAH, I CAN
NAME SOURCES !

21:11.367 --> 21:13.067
SOPHIA LOREN
WAS ONCE A SOURCE !

21:13.067 --> 21:14.433
I KNOW MY SOURCES !

21:14.467 --> 21:16.267
SOMETIMES THEY'RE
MYSTERIOUS SOURCES,

21:16.300 --> 21:17.833
AND, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE IT COMES FROM !

21:17.867 --> 21:19.233
OTHER TIMES,
I CAN PINPOINT IT !

21:19.267 --> 21:20.433
WHAT ABOUT ME ?

21:20.467 --> 21:22.167
AM I NOT EVEN
INVOLVED IN
A SOURCE ?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.067
YEAH, YOU'RE A SOURCE,
SHE'S A SOURCE.

21:24.067 --> 21:25.267
OH, MY GOD !

21:25.300 --> 21:26.800
LISTEN, YOU
GOT A HARD-ON.

21:26.833 --> 21:27.800
NO, I DIDN'T !

21:27.833 --> 21:28.967
YOU GOT
A HARD-ON !

21:29.067 --> 21:30.400
LOOK, LOOK,
LOOK AT THESE PANTS.

21:30.433 --> 21:31.833
THAT'S NOT WHAT
IT LOOKED LIKE.

21:31.867 --> 21:33.400
THAT WAS FLOPPING,
THIS WAS NOT FLOPPING.

21:33.433 --> 21:34.600
THERE WAS SOMETHING
HARD IN THERE,

21:34.633 --> 21:36.367
AND IT WAS YOUR
FUCKING DICK !

21:36.400 --> 21:38.067
ARE YOU CRAZY ?

21:38.067 --> 21:39.200
DON'T WALK OUT !

21:39.233 --> 21:41.267
( Larry )
LET ME SHOW YOU,
I'LL GET THE PANTS !

21:41.300 --> 21:42.967
( door slamming )

21:43.067 --> 21:44.067
WHAT DID YOU HAVE
TO TELL HER THAT FOR ?!

21:44.100 --> 21:45.800
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
THE WHOLE STORY,

21:45.833 --> 21:47.367
THANK YOU !

21:47.400 --> 21:48.367
JESUS.

21:52.733 --> 21:54.767
( chattering )

21:54.800 --> 21:56.900
LOOK WHAT'S
DOING HERE.

21:56.933 --> 22:00.367
THIS IS REALLY
CROWDED.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.133
HI, UH, RESERVATION
FOR 8:00,

22:02.167 --> 22:03.133
FOR DAVID.

22:03.167 --> 22:05.400
UH, YES.

22:05.433 --> 22:08.233
I HAVE YOU FOR
A PARTY OF FOUR.

22:08.267 --> 22:11.333
YEAH, BUT THERE ARE ONLY
GONNA BE TWO OF US.

22:11.367 --> 22:13.100
LARRY, HEY,
HEY, COME HERE !

22:13.133 --> 22:14.833
HEY !

22:14.867 --> 22:16.867

22:16.900 --> 22:17.867
( Jeff )
HEY, CHERYL !

22:17.900 --> 22:19.767
HI !

22:19.800 --> 22:21.733
OOH, I HAVEN'T SEEN
YOU IN SO LONG,

22:21.767 --> 22:22.733
OOH, 'LOOKIT.

22:22.767 --> 22:23.733
HI, MR. AND
MRS. GREENE.

22:23.767 --> 22:25.533
THIS IS CHERYL,
LARRY'S WIFE,

22:25.567 --> 22:26.533
THIS IS
JEFF'S PARENTS.

22:26.567 --> 22:27.900
HI.

22:27.933 --> 22:30.267
( Mrs. Greene )
HOW DO YOU DO,
CHERYL, IS IT ?

22:30.300 --> 22:31.700
YES.

22:31.733 --> 22:33.533
HOW ARE YOU, CHERYL ?
NICE TO SEE YOU.

22:33.567 --> 22:35.067
PRETTY LADY,
PRETTY LADY.

22:35.067 --> 22:36.433
HOW'S
EVERYTHING ?

22:36.467 --> 22:38.100
( silence )

22:40.133 --> 22:41.133
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND ?

22:41.167 --> 22:42.100
( Larry )
YEAH.

22:43.633 --> 22:45.167
SHE'S NOT GONNA TELL HER
ABOUT THE HITLER THING ?

22:45.200 --> 22:46.800
NO, NO, NO,
NO WAY.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.500
I PROMISE YOU,
I PROMISE YOU, NO WAY.

22:49.533 --> 22:50.767
LISTEN, THERE IS
A LITTLE BIT OF
A PROBLEM, THOUGH.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.400
REMEMBER THE OTHER DAY
WHEN YOU WERE LEAVING,

22:53.433 --> 22:54.400
AND WE WANTED YOU
TO COME UPSTAIRS

22:54.433 --> 22:55.400
AND LOOK
AT THE KID ?

22:55.433 --> 22:56.967
SUSIE ASKED YOU
TO COME UPSTAIRS ?

22:57.067 --> 22:58.733
MY PARENTS ARE MAD
YOU DIDN'T.

22:58.767 --> 23:00.133
WHAT ?

23:00.167 --> 23:01.500
MY PARENTS ARE UPSET
YOU DIDN'T COME UP,

23:01.533 --> 23:03.200
THEY THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD COME UP.

23:03.233 --> 23:04.667
UP THE STAIRS ?
TO SEE THE KIDS ?

23:04.700 --> 23:06.200
THEY'RE MAD AT ME ?

23:06.233 --> 23:07.733
THEY'RE MAD AT YOU.

23:07.767 --> 23:08.733
THAT'S INSANE.

23:08.767 --> 23:09.733
I'VE ALREADY TOLD
THEM THEY'RE CRAZY.

23:09.767 --> 23:11.100
AND, WHAT DID
THEY SAY ?

23:11.133 --> 23:12.967
THEY SAID, IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE
IF HE WOULD'VE CAME UPSTAIRS,

23:13.067 --> 23:13.967
WHAT KIND OF MAN
DOESN'T COME UPSTAIRS

23:14.067 --> 23:15.700
TO LOOK AT
ANOTHER MAN'S KID ?

23:15.733 --> 23:18.100
THEY DIDN'T EVEN
SAY HELLO TO ME.

23:18.133 --> 23:20.767
I KNOW, THEY'RE
UPSET WITH YOU.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.800
HOLD ON, SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.067
( hostess )
EXCUSE ME.

23:23.067 --> 23:26.067
I'M TRYING TO FIND
A PLACE FOR A TABLE OF TWO,

23:26.067 --> 23:28.967
AND I JUST
DON'T HAVE ONE.

23:29.067 --> 23:30.267
WAIT A SECOND...

23:30.300 --> 23:32.067
( Cheryl )
WHAT'S HAPPENING ?

23:32.067 --> 23:36.067
WE CAN'T SIT TWO PEOPLE
AT A TABLE OF FOUR...

23:36.067 --> 23:37.700
WE'LL TAKE A TABLE
FOR TWO, THEN.

23:37.733 --> 23:39.933
RIGHT, THERE IS NO
TABLE FOR TWO AVAILABLE

23:39.967 --> 23:41.300
FOR ANOTHER
HOUR AND A HALF.

23:41.333 --> 23:42.300
WELL, THEN, WE'LL TAKE
THE TABLE FOR FOUR,

23:42.333 --> 23:43.367
AND THERE'LL
JUST BE TWO OF US.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.167
RIGHT, WE CAN'T
SIT A TWO IN A FOUR,

23:45.200 --> 23:46.433
WE CAN ONLY SIT
A FOUR IN A FOUR.

23:46.467 --> 23:47.733
OTHERWISE, WE'RE
WASTING SPACE.

23:47.767 --> 23:48.733
I KNOW, BUT WE HAD
A RESERVATION
FOR FOUR,

23:48.767 --> 23:50.400
AND THE TWO PEOPLE
COULDN'T COME.

23:50.433 --> 23:51.667
I CAN'T DO IT,
IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD,

23:51.700 --> 23:53.467
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.867
THANK YOU,
THAT'S FINE.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.100
YOU KNOW WHAT,
LARRY ?

24:01.133 --> 24:02.700
YOU SHOULD
JUST TELL HER
WHO YOU ARE.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.567
YEAH, WHO AM I ?

24:04.600 --> 24:05.867
I'M A GUY WITHOUT A TABLE,
THAT'S WHO I AM.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.967
TRY THE "SEINFELD" THING
AND SEE IF SHE REACTS.

24:08.067 --> 24:10.933
FORGET IT, I'M NOT
GONNA SAY THAT.

24:10.967 --> 24:11.933
IT WILL HELP.

24:11.967 --> 24:15.400
MA'AM, CAN YOU COME
FOR ONE SECOND ?

24:15.433 --> 24:17.700
TELL HER
WHO YOU ARE.

24:17.733 --> 24:19.067
HE WAS ONE OF THE
CREATORS OF "SEINFELD".

24:19.067 --> 24:21.200
( Larry )
SO WHAT, RIGHT ?
OKAY, BIG DEAL, FINE.

24:21.233 --> 24:23.167
WHAT I'M
SAYING IS...

24:23.200 --> 24:24.900
SHE CAN FIND
A TABLE FOR YOU.

24:24.933 --> 24:26.500
I WISH I COULD
HELP YOU, BUT...

24:26.533 --> 24:28.633
YOU'VE SEEN IT.

24:28.667 --> 24:29.700
I SAW IT ONCE,
IT WAS GOOD.

24:29.733 --> 24:31.067
( Larry )
DID YOU, REALLY ?
WHICH ONE ?

24:31.067 --> 24:32.067
I CAN'T
REMEMBER.

24:32.067 --> 24:33.167
OKAY, GREAT, SEE ?

24:33.200 --> 24:34.867
SHE NEVER EVEN SAW
THE SHOW, GOOD GOING.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.733
BUT WE CAN'T
GIVE PREFERENTIAL
TREATMENT HERE.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.533
( Jeff )
CHERYL, LARRY, JOIN US,
WE GOT THE CORNER TABLE.

24:40.567 --> 24:43.200

24:43.233 --> 24:44.600
PLEASE DO,

HIM AND HIS FAMILY ?

25:00.400 --> 25:01.800
I'M STARVING.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.900
I'M GONNA GET
THE VEAL PARMESAN.

25:08.933 --> 25:11.067
( Mrs. Greene )
OH, HONEY, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GET THAT.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.333

SHRIMP WITH IT...

25:23.200 --> 25:24.433
WELL, I'M NOT
