00:21.271 --> 00:25.316
Andy, look! King of Camp.
You used to win this every year, remember?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.444
Yeah, eight years in a row.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.154
- You ruled!
- Ah, whatever.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.656
Probably still a record.
Who cares? I certainly don't.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.743
Holy shit! Look, it's the kid
from the softball game.

00:38.079 --> 00:41.791
I'm sorry, mister. I was aiming
at the trash can next to you.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.140
Maybe you should get your eyes checked.
Sounds like they're broken.

00:46.546 --> 00:50.216
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know. Somethin'.

00:51.843 --> 00:54.554
Hey! So you think you're King of Camp?

00:56.181 --> 01:01.853
Well, in my book,
Charlie ain't nothing at all. No chance.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.522
Okay. How about this?

01:07.484 --> 01:08.985
Fuck off, old man.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.236
Ooh!

01:10.320 --> 01:11.321
Suck my balls.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.083
I was King of Camp
for eight years in a row.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.961
And now you're just a pile of old bones
with a shitty haircut

01:27.045 --> 01:29.380
and dumb-looking goat hoof
stuck to your chin.

01:30.715 --> 01:35.220
Well, I guess there's really only one way
to settle this once and for all.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.889
King of Camp challenge duel.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.977
What the hell is that?

01:43.061 --> 01:48.316
There's a... rarely used clause
in the camp by-laws,

01:48.399 --> 01:54.447
section six, sub-section B,
paragraph four, sub-paragraph D2.

01:54.531 --> 01:59.410
It allows a former King of Camp
to challenge the current King of Camp

01:59.494 --> 02:04.207
to a series of competitions,
thereby deciding anew...

02:09.211 --> 02:10.547
the King of Camp.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.675
- I'm in.
- I'm in, too, as well.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.260
Sounds like we're both in then.

02:15.343 --> 02:18.138
Sound the drums!

02:48.543 --> 02:51.963
King of Camp. Here... we... Let's go!

03:02.307 --> 03:04.893
We are a civilized people.

03:04.976 --> 03:09.397
But there is a time for civility
and a time for combat.

03:10.648 --> 03:14.986
Ten minutes ago,
a King of Camp challenge was invoked.

03:15.820 --> 03:20.575
And now our mighty warriors
will compete in a series of events

03:20.658 --> 03:24.162
using all the elements
of the native spirits.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.373
Air, water, wind, fire,

03:27.457 --> 03:32.795
light, snow, magma, vapor, plant and dirt.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.589
The challenger,

03:34.672 --> 03:40.261
King of Camp from 1974 to 1981,
Andy Fleckner.

03:41.763 --> 03:48.269
And our current King of Camp
crown holder, Jeremy Deegenstein!

03:51.189 --> 03:55.693
And the winner
will be crowned King of Camp!

03:55.777 --> 04:00.323
And the spirit of Camp Firewood
will pay him back tenfold

04:00.406 --> 04:05.995
in fabric and spices and beads and glory!

04:06.913 --> 04:08.081
Gentlemen.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.458
Let's have a fair fight.

04:10.541 --> 04:11.960
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.253
Walla-walla-hoo!

04:13.336 --> 04:14.754
Walla-walla-hey!

04:14.837 --> 04:16.798
Kim-chu-ay!

04:16.880 --> 04:17.923
Chu-ay!

04:19.341 --> 04:21.302
Begin!

04:24.639 --> 04:26.015
Run, run, run!

04:40.863 --> 04:45.618
What are you even doing? Why are you here?
Lunch ended, like, yesterday.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.414
Iâ€™m waiting for Garth, my boyfriend.
He had an important phone call.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.834
Wait, I'm sorry. Your boyfriend?

04:55.003 --> 04:56.254
What's that supposed to mean?

04:56.337 --> 04:58.548
- What's what supposed to mean?
- You chortled.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.550
Just surprised you have a boyfriend,
that's all.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.135
You seem fairly unlovable to me.

05:02.218 --> 05:05.722
- Fuck you, Logan!
- Fuck yourself, Suze! It's cheaper.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.225
- Not if I charge myself!
- Can't hear you!

05:26.200 --> 05:27.785
- Victor, how are you?
- Ow!

05:27.869 --> 05:29.829
- So, Victor, are you ready for it?
- What?

05:29.912 --> 05:32.457
- Are you ready to do it?
- I'm... What?

05:32.540 --> 05:34.709
He's asking if you think
you're ready to do it?

05:35.501 --> 05:38.629
I donâ€™t know! Why is everybody
putting so much pressure on me?

05:38.713 --> 05:42.341
I'm gonna be in the infirmary
later tonight, waiting for you, if you...

05:42.425 --> 05:46.971
Victor, no pressure.
It's not for to be nervous, and then...

05:47.055 --> 05:50.016
See you in the infirmary at 7:45.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.352
- Was it something I said?
- What?

05:53.436 --> 05:56.314
- Was it something I said?
- What is that?

05:56.397 --> 05:59.358
- I say, was it something I said?
- I don't...

06:03.780 --> 06:05.239
Jeez, how long was I out?

06:08.326 --> 06:11.037
Ooh! That nap was incredible.
I really went for it.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.082
Iâ€™m soaking wet.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.126
Vic, what's wrong?

06:18.169 --> 06:20.254
Yaron and Donna want me to...

06:21.380 --> 06:23.633
shove a baby into her with my penis.

06:24.926 --> 06:28.805
I think Yaron's got dry balls
or something. I don't know.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.099
- Whoa!
- But they don't know...

06:32.266 --> 06:33.601
that I have never...

06:35.853 --> 06:37.230
- Spit it out!
- They don't know

06:37.313 --> 06:40.441
that I haven't had sex,
or whatever you call it, Neil.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.861
Vic, this is it.
This is the moment.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.697
This is a great opportunity
for you to finally lose your V-card!

06:46.781 --> 06:49.992
- No, Neil. Don't you get it?
- What?

06:50.076 --> 06:52.537
My dick is all thumbs!
It's got two left feet!

06:52.620 --> 06:54.420
It canâ€™t walk and chew gum
at the same time!

06:54.455 --> 06:57.208
- Dicks aren't supposed to chew gum!
- You don't know that!

06:57.291 --> 06:58.851
- I do, Vic!
- You don't know my dick...

06:59.710 --> 07:01.003
Listen to me.

07:01.921 --> 07:05.675
If you really want to learn
how to use your dick...

07:06.509 --> 07:07.677
I will teach you.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.054
Yeah?

07:11.180 --> 07:13.474
Uh... yeah.

07:20.356 --> 07:26.571
The score is tied.
King of Camp event number five, dizzy bat.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.715
- Come on.
- You got this.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.164
Egg on a spoon.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.999
Go! Race carefully.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.461
- You got this. Yeah!
- Come on, Andy. Come on!

07:41.544 --> 07:42.604
- This is so fun.
- Come on, Andy!

07:42.628 --> 07:45.590
- God, isn't this like old times?
- Yeah.

07:45.673 --> 07:46.966
- Hey, Coop.
- Yeah...

07:47.049 --> 07:49.510
- Can we talk for a sec? Privately?
- Sure, Ginny, sure.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.636
Okay.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.014
So, Coop...

07:53.097 --> 07:57.268
You know Iâ€™m the kind of girl
who would never give her man an ultimatum.

07:57.351 --> 07:58.603
I know, and that's what's so...

07:58.686 --> 08:01.898
Until now. I don't want you hanging out
with Katie anymore, okay?

08:01.981 --> 08:04.317
Um, and if you do...

08:05.151 --> 08:07.862
Iâ€™m going to have to seriously reconsider
this relationship.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.365
Okay?

08:12.575 --> 08:13.743
Come on, Andy!

08:14.702 --> 08:16.822
Come in here.
I have to show you something.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.796
You've gotta see this knife
that Renata bought.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.960
It looks like it was made
for gutting deer.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.295
This is her bag.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.275
I donâ€™t like the idea of
rifling through someone else's stuff.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.594
Claire, I need you.
Remember our deal, fifty-fifty.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.846
- I never agreed to that.
- Fifty-fifty, Claire!

08:34.429 --> 08:35.681
I never...

08:36.974 --> 08:38.183
Oh, my God.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.062
She cut you
out of all the photos.

08:42.145 --> 08:44.273
Sheâ€™s trying to cut
me out of my own life.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.734
We've gotta warn Ben.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.823
Okay, the first thing
you need to do is just relax.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.618
Where's the confident Victor Pulak
that I've known my whole life?

08:55.701 --> 08:59.205
That man is a fraud, Neil.
A fake, freaking fraud.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.040
You know what would boost your confidence?

09:02.166 --> 09:05.127
A new look. Why donâ€™t you
let me give you a makeover?

09:05.211 --> 09:07.797
A makeover? Do you know how to do that?

09:07.880 --> 09:10.192
What do you think I've been taking
night classes at Barbizon for?

09:10.216 --> 09:11.216
To pass the time?

09:11.259 --> 09:12.802
So what do you say?

09:12.885 --> 09:15.012
- What do I say?
- Yeah.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.431
I say, let's do it.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.434
Here we go!

09:20.518 --> 09:23.604
- And we're done. How do you feel?
- Amazing.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.328
If you think that's good, check this out.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.902
Whoa! Those people at Barbizon
don't fool around.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.781
Whoo!

09:33.864 --> 09:35.199
Yeah!

09:38.828 --> 09:40.079
Okay, here's the plan.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.682
We'll find Ben, get the baby,
and then get the hell out of here.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.041
- Got it?
- Yes, yes!

09:44.125 --> 09:47.587
Listen to me, you screw-up.
We only have one shot at this, okay?

09:47.670 --> 09:53.217
So when I say kill the baby at 2:00 p.m.,
I mean kill the baby at 2:00 p.m.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.053
Oh!

09:57.221 --> 10:00.641
Hi!
Didn't see you guys standing there.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.310
What did you hear me say?

10:02.393 --> 10:04.437
Nothing. I didn't hear...

10:04.520 --> 10:05.956
- Ear.
- We didn't hear anything.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.649
- Had a fever, and...
- She had a fever, I have swimmer's ear.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.403
Run!

10:12.486 --> 10:16.324
Okay, we gotta find Ben.
Split up. We'll cover more ground.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.369
Ben? Ben!

10:21.746 --> 10:22.746
Hello?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.127
Why's Mark's bag open?

10:35.092 --> 10:36.969
"Fuck book"?

10:43.559 --> 10:47.480
Mandy, gulp! Didn't miss a drop.
Sandy, right in the eye. Ha!

10:47.563 --> 10:50.483
How do I love thee?
Connie, what a body on that little minx.

10:50.566 --> 10:54.028
I swear, I'm like a one-man bukkake show.
Sandra, anal, check.

10:54.111 --> 10:57.657
Chandra, fucked her so hard,
her nose ring fell out and came...

10:58.908 --> 11:01.619
Oh, hey. What are you doing in here?

11:01.702 --> 11:03.037
What is this, Mark?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.580
Uh...

11:04.664 --> 11:07.249
- A book.
- What's it doing in your luggage?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.960
I don't know, okay?
Why are you grilling me all of a sudden?

11:10.044 --> 11:13.881
How could I be so stupid?
God, I should've known.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.926
And to think I was actually considering
moving in with you.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.608
You were never moving in with me, Claire.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.349
All you care about
is your stupid independence.

11:24.016 --> 11:27.561
Well, did you ever think about what
all that "independence" was doing to me?

11:27.645 --> 11:30.523
- Christ!
- Ah, fuck!

11:31.732 --> 11:33.234
Claire!

11:34.860 --> 11:37.822
Go to this address.
All your questions will be answered.

11:48.958 --> 11:49.958
- Hi!
- Hey.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.502
How are ya? Sorry to bother you.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.672
Listen, whatever youâ€™re selling,
weâ€™re not interested.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.317
- Iâ€™m a journalist, please.
- Like I said, we're not interested.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.342
Can we talk? I just...

12:01.011 --> 12:03.597
The thing is, I just need
ten minutes of your time.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.559
- Seven.
- Okay.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.984
Let's go!

12:15.067 --> 12:19.530
Okay! Each of you
must make up a song about...

12:20.990 --> 12:22.032
dinosaurs! Go!

12:22.616 --> 12:26.078
- ♪ Brontosaurus ♪
- ♪ Where did you go ♪

12:26.871 --> 12:29.999
- ♪ Stegosaurus ♪
- ♪ My friends, dinosaurs ♪

12:30.082 --> 12:31.435
♪ Don't forget the pterodactyl ♪

12:31.459 --> 12:34.462
♪ Why did you leave me
On the verge of extinction ♪

12:34.545 --> 12:37.524
- ♪ Everybody's doinâ€™ the Dinosaur Stomp
♪ - ♪ I shed a tear for you ♪

12:37.548 --> 12:39.091
♪ Dinosaur Stomp ♪

12:39.175 --> 12:43.888
- ♪ Dino ♪ - ♪ Ooh ♪

12:44.722 --> 12:45.973
Point, Deegs!

12:46.056 --> 12:47.433
- Go!
- Let's go!

12:47.516 --> 12:48.726
Come on, Andy!

12:48.809 --> 12:51.312
Um, I'm gonna run back to the cabin
to grab my sunblock.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.898
- Okay.
- So...

12:53.981 --> 12:59.653
Oh. Listen, Ginny, I heard you,
and I totally respect what you had to say.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.907
- I won't talk to Katie.
- Thanks, Coop.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.325
Boop.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.036
- Hey, Coop.
- Hey, Katie!

13:07.119 --> 13:08.704
I was wondering if we could talk.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.873
Oh! Um...

13:10.956 --> 13:15.085
See, Ginny feels really weird about us,
and I'm not supposed to talk to you.

13:15.169 --> 13:18.005
- I'm sure you can understand.
- Oh, I see.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.258
Okay, so we won't talk.

13:22.927 --> 13:23.761
Okay.

13:23.844 --> 13:27.348
And I won't be at the goat barn
in exactly one hour.

13:27.431 --> 13:31.227
Just to be clear.
Does "I won't" mean "I will"?

13:31.310 --> 13:34.230
No, it doesn't.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.942
Just purely for logistical purposes,

13:38.025 --> 13:40.861
you're just saying,
"Meet me in an hour at the goat barn,"

13:40.945 --> 13:42.404
and you're saying it in a weird way

13:42.488 --> 13:46.200
'cause you don't want me
to have to say to Ginny that we talked.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.952
No, I'm "not."

13:49.912 --> 13:52.122
- Please.
- Thank you.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.085
Hello.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.634
- I think I know why you're here.
- Why am I here?

14:03.717 --> 14:06.428
- It's about him, isn't it?
- Him who?

14:08.389 --> 14:09.265
Hello?

14:09.348 --> 14:11.183
- Hi, hon.
- Who's this?

14:11.267 --> 14:12.643
Who are you?

14:12.726 --> 14:14.436
- I'm a journalist...
- She's a journalist

14:14.520 --> 14:17.106
- from the media.
- News.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.568
Um, would you excuse us for just a second?

14:20.651 --> 14:21.902
- Thanks.
- Of course.

14:22.778 --> 14:23.938
I'm sorry.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.702
What did I tell you
right before I left? I said...

14:31.287 --> 14:32.830
Would you like a wafer?

14:33.414 --> 14:34.874
Bathroom.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.102
Oh, God. Do you have to go
to the bathroom?

14:37.126 --> 14:38.627
You do.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.550
I do.

14:44.633 --> 14:48.220
- We've got to tell somebody.
- He will kill us. He will kill her, too.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.230
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to ask you to leave.

14:56.687 --> 15:00.399
- Could I use the bathroom before I go?
- No.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.737
But I really have to, uh...

15:05.321 --> 15:06.488
Take a bath.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.200
All right. Make it quick.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.571
Camp Firewood?

15:59.917 --> 16:03.921
Oh, my God.

16:04.630 --> 16:09.343
Ronald Reagan went to Camp Firewood?
You need to tell me everything.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.984
- Garth?
- Darling! There you are!

16:25.067 --> 16:27.907
I thought you were coming back
to the dining hall after your phone call.

16:27.987 --> 16:32.116
I was just about to come and find you.
I've just had the most amazing news.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.744
Billy Baldwin has dropped out of
The Neptune Effect.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.747
- They want me to jump in!
- What?

16:38.831 --> 16:40.874
$35 million budget. Top-line talent.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.960
It's going to win technical awards
for sure.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.504
Yeah, my people think
this could put me into the next tier.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.673
- Wow! Iâ€™m so happy for you.
- Mmm.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.092
- For us.
- Yeah, well, that's the thing, Suze.

16:50.175 --> 16:54.513
It's shooting in Budapest, of all places,
for eight months, and I've got to go now.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.599
But what about you and me?

16:58.183 --> 16:59.863
You know I think youâ€™re fantastic, Suze.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.438
But you want me to turn this down?
It's a massive opportunity.

17:04.897 --> 17:07.776
- Let me come with you.
- Theyâ€™ve already bought the ticket,

17:07.859 --> 17:10.029
so we wouldnâ€™t even get seats together
at this point.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.906
I can sneak in your suitcase.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.951
- You're simply too big, darling.
- Garth...

17:18.162 --> 17:19.788
Are you breaking up with me?

17:20.455 --> 17:22.540
Susie... Susie!

17:22.624 --> 17:26.545
But what about our movie? What about
By the Grace of God and Ever After?

17:26.627 --> 17:29.506
Oh, you funny little thing,
I thought you understood.

17:29.590 --> 17:33.677
Iâ€™m an action movie star now.
I'm done with the festival fare.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.780
I'm sure you'll get someone good.
It's a great role.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.307
You said I'm your muse.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.769
Oh, darling, you were.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.690
Come on, donâ€™t let me leave like this.
Give us a smile.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.526
There she is.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.571
All right, cheerio, love.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.289
Go, Deegy!

18:03.373 --> 18:05.959
Hot pepper chow down! Go!

18:06.043 --> 18:08.670
Peppers! Peppers! Peppers!

18:23.769 --> 18:27.648
Okay, we're gonna pretend
that this mattress is a woman.

18:27.731 --> 18:28.731
Okay.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.275
- Get in there.
- Is this her front?

18:30.359 --> 18:32.820
Yup, her head's at this end.
Just like normal sex.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.572
- Good to know that that's normal sex.
- Just jump right in there.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.869
You're not...

18:42.371 --> 18:43.747
Let me show you a couple things.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.707
First, see how I'm entering her.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.501
Scoop-a-doop. Scoop-a-doop.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.961
- Yup.
- I'm gonna put it in.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.713
All right. All right... Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Slower. Slower!

18:51.797 --> 18:53.841
Vic! I didn't mean to scare you.

18:53.924 --> 18:56.385
- That's it, good. Look into her eyes.
- Hi.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.970
- Don't say hi.
- Goodbye, goodbye.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.139
- Don't say hello or goodbye.
- Forget what I said.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.117
Okay, don't...
You look like you're gonna throw up.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.809
Try smiling. Okay, don't do that.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.912
Pretend like you're in line
at the bank or something.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.020
All right, you got it.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.626
You're doing it! You're doing it, Vic!
You're really doing it!

19:11.650 --> 19:13.235
- Hi.
- Stop saying hi.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.838
- Good! Way to go, buddy.
- I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

19:17.281 --> 19:19.700
- Yeah!
- Donna's not gonna know what hit her.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.955
- McKinley! McKinley!
- Ben.

19:25.038 --> 19:28.709
- I'm at the horse stable.
- The horse stable. The horse stable.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.669
McKinley.

19:30.752 --> 19:34.923
Ben, thank God. There you are.
I was right. Renata's a lying bitch.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.385
- No. McKinley, calm down.
- No, don't fucking tell me to calm down!

19:38.468 --> 19:41.555
She's a fucking bloodthirsty,
murderous, bitch-ass psycho!

19:42.556 --> 19:43.682
What?

19:44.725 --> 19:45.767
Surprise.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.896
- Surprise.
- Surprise.

19:50.564 --> 19:51.565
Surprise.

19:51.648 --> 19:55.861
Renata organized a surprise
wedding anniversary for you. For us.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.322
No, no, Ben. She's got a knife.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.658
For this cake I made you.
Carrot cake. Your favorite.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.870
No, no. You cut me out of the photos.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.455
For the memory collage.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.707
I had enough of Ben.
I needed a few more of you.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.627
No, Ben, listen to me.
I heard you on the phone.

20:11.710 --> 20:15.088
She said, "Kill the baby at 2:00 p.m."

20:15.172 --> 20:18.717
Kill the Baby is a popular swing band
from Asheville, North Carolina.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.510
Ben told me you loved swing music.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.805
Hey everyone, we're Kill the Baby.
This is our hit song, "Jumpin' Jambalaya."

20:23.889 --> 20:25.474
I do love swing music.

Each of our combatants will be lit on fire
and they will walk as fast as they can

21:23.073 --> 21:25.200
before being overcome by flames.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.828
As the score is tied,

21:27.911 --> 21:33.000
whoever wins this
will be crowned King of Camp.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.626

Let's go!

22:13.248 --> 22:16.668
- Suck it, old man! Let's go!
- On fire like a big D.

22:23.925 --> 22:27.721
I wish there was something I could do,
but there's literally nothing.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.266
You know what happens now.

22:37.314 --> 22:41.068
- Loser! Loser! Loser!
- Ow!

22:52.746 --> 22:55.290
This is total bull jizz!
I should've won.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.667
Yeah, why don't you go cry
in your bunk about it?

22:57.751 --> 22:59.336
Whoa!

23:07.552 --> 23:08.552
Idiot.

23:10.347 --> 23:14.309
So, Beth, we just need you to put
your John Hancock here and here.

23:15.018 --> 23:18.480
Oh, you know what? I've been meaning
to give you something for ten years.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.359
Remember these? From that night
you came to destroy the camp?

23:24.027 --> 23:26.363
But you didn't.
Instead, you saved us from Ronald Reagan.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.907
'Cause love triumphs over evil every time.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.747
- Anywhozzle, I'm just gonna sign...
- Actually, before you sign...

23:36.498 --> 23:39.060
I'd like to have our lawyer
take a look at the eminent domain clause.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.085
What?

23:40.168 --> 23:41.848
We need to make sure
this is done properly.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.733
I have a plan.
Just bring Reagan to the bunker.

23:45.757 --> 23:46.925
What the hell is he doing?

23:55.559 --> 23:57.727
- Hi.
- Renata...

23:58.395 --> 24:01.731
I... I donâ€™t know what to say.
I am so sorry I misjudged you.

24:01.815 --> 24:04.818
It's hard being a new parent.
I get it.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.946
- Will you accept my apology?
- Of course I will, yeah.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.866
- Thank you.
- Come here, you.

24:10.949 --> 24:11.949
Oh!

24:13.034 --> 24:14.119
Mmm!

24:14.828 --> 24:17.539
- I have a secret to tell you.
- What's that?

24:17.622 --> 24:19.166
You were right about me.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.752
You fell right into my trap.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.088
I made you look insane.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.341
And now, no matter what I do,
no one will believe you.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.763
What do you want from me?

24:34.973 --> 24:36.558
Everything.

24:36.641 --> 24:41.313
- Oh, Renata, Ashley's waking up.
- Be right there, Ben.
