WEBVTT

00:38.360 --> 00:41.400
I am so sorry, Michael. Why didn't
you call me?

00:45.520 --> 00:47.920
I thought you said it was just a
chest infection.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.240
We did everything we could,
Mr Robson.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.560
Do you want to see him?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.200
Say goodbye?

01:19.120 --> 01:20.800
Do you want any of this junk?

01:21.800 --> 01:22.920
Don't you?

01:25.840 --> 01:28.800
We're deeply sorry for your loss,
Mr Robson.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.760
For the loss of income, more like.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.560
What's this, a refund?

01:37.560 --> 01:38.800
Consent forms.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.600
There's one for you.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.120
We have to take him now.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.760
Come on, Derek. I'm trying to tell
you.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.400
Yes, yes, all right. Please.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.880
Careful now. Careful.

02:06.880 --> 02:11.200
Someone was in there.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.080
In Robbo's room.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.360
All right, all right.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.320
What have you given him?

02:18.320 --> 02:20.200
Only what you've prescribed.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.000
Every night...

02:22.000 --> 02:23.960
..talking.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.760
Shouting.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.640
Best up the dosage, then.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.400
It makes him sick.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.680
When I want your medical opinion
Miss Naidu, I will ask for it.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.600
I'm trying to do my job. I'm just...
I'm reporting to you how it...

02:36.600 --> 02:40.280
Yes, and I am trying to do mine!

02:40.280 --> 02:42.280
What are you doing?

02:42.280 --> 02:44.400
Was it you?

02:44.400 --> 02:45.760
Did you kill him?

02:56.560 --> 02:58.360
God bless you, Robbo.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.000
Hang on, hang on!

03:03.000 --> 03:04.320
Mr Robson.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.800
Those forms I signed...say that I
consent to not having a funeral.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.880
He didn't know his father's donating
his body to medical training.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.840
It's what your father wanted,
Michael.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.280
So why didn't he tell me that?

03:15.280 --> 03:16.680
I don't know.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.480
I'm not going to let him do this to
me.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.400
Can we discuss this at the main
house? Come on.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.600
Safe journey, old friend.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.200
Derek?

03:43.200 --> 03:45.240
What's the matter? Robbo.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.560
Robbo. He's going now.

03:49.560 --> 03:53.320
Last night, every bloody one!

03:53.320 --> 03:55.280
All of it!

03:55.280 --> 03:56.600
Say goodbye, now.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.920
Someone came for him.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.640
He was killed.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.920
I'm telling you...

04:11.920 --> 04:13.280
..it isn't right!

04:14.440 --> 04:19.240
# Testator silens

04:24.160 --> 04:31.040
# Contestes e spiritu

04:31.040 --> 04:35.560
# Silencium

04:45.600 --> 04:51.360
# Testator silens. #

05:05.680 --> 05:08.360
Today, we begin the practical stage
of the course.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.400
I didn't get to dissect a real
cadaver at med school.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.120
Our bodies were on a digital anatomy
tables.

05:16.120 --> 05:18.000
Well, thanks to these kind people,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.120
they've generously donated their
bodies

05:20.120 --> 05:23.120
to give you the opportunity to do it
for real.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.520
Now, as you know, pathologists start
their postmortems

05:26.520 --> 05:28.320
in a variety of different ways.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.600
Would someone like to tell me what
their first incision would be?

05:33.920 --> 05:36.560
So, I would start from the sternal
notch,

05:36.560 --> 05:39.240
then down the centre of the sternum
itself,

05:39.240 --> 05:41.000
and then I'd extend the incision

05:41.000 --> 05:43.720
down the midline of the abdominal
wall to the pubis.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.880
Good.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.400
As a forensic pathologist,

05:46.400 --> 05:49.520
I would start with an incision from
behind each ear

05:49.520 --> 05:51.400
that comes to the sternal notch

05:51.400 --> 05:53.640
before proceeding down the sternum,

05:53.640 --> 05:56.960
to give a closer look at the
anterior aspect of the neck.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.920
But I think you're right.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.120
I know some of you may have seen
PMs,

06:01.120 --> 06:04.560
but, given this is the first time
you're actually doing it yourselves,

06:04.560 --> 06:07.280
I would start with the midline
incision.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.000
Does anyone want to demonstrate?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.880
I'll give it a go. Great.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.600
Anyone from over here? Sure.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.360
How deep do I cut?

06:22.640 --> 06:24.360
Well, if you start with the thorax,

06:24.360 --> 06:26.360
the breastbone is so close to the
skin

06:26.360 --> 06:27.920
that no matter how hard you try,

06:27.920 --> 06:30.080
there's very little you can do
wrong.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.120
Famous last words.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.520
It's cold and wet...

06:35.520 --> 06:37.240
..like leather.

06:37.240 --> 06:40.720
Yeah, you have to be careful of
the subcutaneous fat,

06:40.720 --> 06:43.360
it will make your hands very
slippery.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.320
I'll just change my gloves.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.480
Would someone else like to take over
for the next stage?

06:48.480 --> 06:50.920
I think I've cut further down than I
should have.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.040
Ah, yes, you have.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.400
What is that?

06:59.840 --> 07:02.960
Ana, can you pass a petri dish
and some forceps? Thanks.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.120
Here.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.440
Thanks.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.440
It looks like an opiate patch.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.960
There's another piece.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.600
How did it get in his stomach?

07:26.600 --> 07:28.400
He must've swallowed it.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.920
Was it a suicide?

07:29.920 --> 07:32.520
Maybe someone fed it to this
guy...to kill him.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.280
That's all speculation.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.000
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.000
6367.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.080
I'm just going to check the
paperwork.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.880
Don't do anything more for now.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.480
Dr Alexander, my body's bleeding.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.080
Henry, embalmed bodies don't bleed.
You know that.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.040
You've cut your own finger.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.520
Where are you living now?

08:05.520 --> 08:07.400
I'm still at my grandmother's...

08:07.400 --> 08:09.080
..until I find somewhere.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.800
How's that working out?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.560
I've got my dad living with me.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.400
I think I'm cramping her style.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.920
This morning, she told me she wanted
another tattoo for her birthday.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.040
What's this? That is tea.

08:22.840 --> 08:26.360
Now I know why you're still single.
Oh, ouch.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.680
You and Nikki...

08:28.680 --> 08:30.320
..you never...?

08:30.320 --> 08:32.280
What?

08:32.280 --> 08:35.080
Two gorgeous people like you...

08:35.080 --> 08:39.320
No, she's with Matt. Has been for
ages, all very happy. Thank you.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.560
1A - Bronchopneumonia,
1B - Emphysema.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.920
Would that explain the fentanyl
patches?

08:54.920 --> 08:57.960
No, he'd been complaining of feeling
unwell -

08:57.960 --> 08:59.800
sore throat and shortness of breath.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.240
He was prescribed antibiotics but
was later found dead.

09:14.040 --> 09:18.280
There's some discolouration on the
inner aspect of the upper lip...

09:18.280 --> 09:22.320
..with a torn fraenum and what looks
like bruising and abrasions

09:22.320 --> 09:24.000
on the labial mucosa.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.800
Difficult to be certain

09:31.800 --> 09:34.720
with postmortem changes and
embalming but...

09:34.720 --> 09:37.320
..there may be a few petechial
haemorrhages here.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.680
Has somebody punched him?

09:38.680 --> 09:40.160
Maybe he was suffocated?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.240
What are you going to do?

09:43.240 --> 09:44.800
Let the police and coroner know.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.640
So you think this death is
suspicious?

09:46.640 --> 09:48.600
It's unexplained, certainly.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.880
Either way, it won't be easy finding
answers,

09:50.880 --> 09:52.800
given he's been dead for nearly two
months

09:52.800 --> 09:55.080
and his body has been through the
embalming process.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.000
But nothing's impossible, right?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.920
If the coroner asks to have a
postmortem,

09:58.920 --> 10:01.040
do you think we could come along and
observe?

10:01.040 --> 10:04.600
Can we? I can ask, but it's not for
me to say.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.000
Listen, I think we'll have to stop
for today,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.840
but I'll let you know what's
happening as soon as I can.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.560
Cheers. Thank you.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.240
I love watching you work.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.040
Oh, thanks.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.080
I really do.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.560
I'm serious.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.800
Ollie.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.400
What's wrong with that? It's true.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.680
Stop it.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.240
You're being watched.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.480
Ah!

10:51.480 --> 10:53.120
He fancies you, too.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.480
What is that?

11:02.160 --> 11:06.440
Coprolites - preserved faeces from
Bronze Age wetland sites,

11:06.440 --> 11:10.520
specifically looking at residual
vegetation and parasite traces.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.440
All right.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.600
How about...

11:19.600 --> 11:20.960
..a blind date?

11:20.960 --> 11:22.920
I don't do blind dates.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.080
I've got the perfect woman for
you.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.560
Simone, you barely know me.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.600
So maybe we should ask someone who
does.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.600
Was he alone when he died?

11:44.600 --> 11:46.760
We have a policy here at Watercress

11:46.760 --> 11:50.720
not to leave anyone in their final
moments on their own.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.800
Good morning, Kate. How's Bob today?

11:53.800 --> 11:55.760
Still not eating.

11:55.760 --> 12:00.280
I'm going to take him out, see if it
perks him up.

12:00.280 --> 12:04.240
You could talk to Amrita, who was
your father's main carer...

12:04.240 --> 12:06.760
..or Dr Young.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.680
Dr Young was your father's
doctor during his time here with us.

12:10.680 --> 12:14.280
Good morning. This is Hannah Robson,
Nigel Robson's daughter.

12:14.280 --> 12:17.200
Ah, yes, Robbo.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.000
We're so very sorry for your loss.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.560
Was he in pain?

12:22.560 --> 12:26.640
Well, your father complained of
a sore throat,

12:26.640 --> 12:29.040
difficulty in breathing.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.600
He had a history of emphysema.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.840
We tested for Covid but that was
negative,

12:34.840 --> 12:40.320
so I prescribed some antibiotics,
but unfortunately...

12:40.320 --> 12:43.600
..the following day, he was found
dead.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.560
I thought you said he wasn't alone.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.640
He died in his sleep.

12:47.640 --> 12:51.360
Amrita was with him in the lodge,
before he slept.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.280
Looking for Derek. Um...

12:55.280 --> 12:57.280
Outside with Amrita.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.920
Do you need a hand?

12:58.920 --> 13:00.720
No, no, no. I'm fine.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.800
Have you talked to your brother?

13:04.800 --> 13:06.600
Not for an age.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.000
Same with my father.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.680
My aunt sent me a message last
summer,

13:11.680 --> 13:14.280
saying that he was here...

13:14.280 --> 13:16.440
..and that I should come home and
make peace

13:16.440 --> 13:18.400
and I left it and I left it...

13:18.400 --> 13:19.960
..and now it's...

13:24.960 --> 13:26.680
Perfect.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.200
What does she do?

13:28.200 --> 13:30.160
I'm not going to say anything more.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.000
Don't want to ruin the surprise.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.240
She's going to get the surprise,
when I don't turn up.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.480
When was the last proper
relationship you had?

13:38.480 --> 13:39.640
Define relationship.

13:41.160 --> 13:44.240
Someone you see more than once and
you know their second name.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.240
Why not? Take a risk.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.200
Yeah. It's just Dad, he's...

13:53.200 --> 13:55.240
..he's all over the place at the
minute.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.600
He's got worse? There's no getting
better.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.720
And after what happened with Ryan...

14:02.720 --> 14:06.000
Well, if it isn't Detective Sergeant
Galloway!

14:07.360 --> 14:09.600
All right? Hello, all right?

14:20.480 --> 14:22.360
Because of the embalming,

14:22.360 --> 14:25.440
any residual blood will be hard and
brittle.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.760
Now, I'll be taking samples of his
liver for toxicology

14:28.760 --> 14:31.800
to see if the fentanyl had actually
been absorbed

14:31.800 --> 14:35.200
and for any other drugs and
medications that might be present.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.040
But first I'm going to remove
Mr Robson's toenail.

14:42.480 --> 14:46.160
With tissues that grow slowly,
like hair and nails,

14:46.160 --> 14:49.840
we can test sections to look
at possible drug administration

14:49.840 --> 14:51.520
over a period of time.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.680
This is why I'm not a pathologist.

15:02.800 --> 15:07.280
We know Mr Robson was complaining
of difficulties with his breathing,

15:07.280 --> 15:10.760
so now we'll focus our attention
on his internal organs.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.360
As you know, fresh lungs

15:16.360 --> 15:18.440
are normally reddy-pink in colour

15:18.440 --> 15:21.520
and aerated, sponge-like
and floppy...

15:21.520 --> 15:23.320
I'll call you back
as soon as possible.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.360
..whereas these are much firmer
and more solid

15:25.360 --> 15:27.600
as a result of the embalming.
I'll call you as soon as...

15:27.600 --> 15:29.440
No, that's the pathologist.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.480
Yes, she's a woman.

15:32.480 --> 15:37.080
Now, lungs with pneumonia usually
have areas of consolidation.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.200
But apart from some changes
in the airspaces,

15:40.200 --> 15:42.760
consistent with emphysema...
 I'm at work!

15:42.760 --> 15:45.640
..the parenchyma appears
homogenous... I've got...

15:45.640 --> 15:47.560
..with no obvious consolidation.
I've got to go.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.000
I've got to go.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.240
Oh. Um... Sorry.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.960
Sorry. His lungs. I'm totally
with you.

15:54.960 --> 15:58.640
So, if it's not pneumonia,
could his breathing difficulties

15:58.640 --> 16:01.360
have been complications with
the fentanyl patches?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.080
It's the right question to ask.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.040
Let's hope that the body provides
an answer. But what do you think?

16:06.040 --> 16:09.400
Well...opiates can
depress respiration,

16:09.400 --> 16:12.240
so wait for toxicology?

16:12.240 --> 16:14.360
And we'll have to wait on histology

16:14.360 --> 16:16.960
to confirm whether there's any
microscopic evidence

16:16.960 --> 16:19.000
that he did actually have pneumonia.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.000
Sorry. Sorry.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.920
Hello?

16:25.920 --> 16:27.160
I...

16:27.160 --> 16:28.720
..didn't hang up on you.

16:30.640 --> 16:34.040
Sergeant Galloway? OK, yeah,
indeed. Sorry.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.160
Sorry. Sorry again. Sorry.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.720
Next I'll be looking at the larynx,

16:39.720 --> 16:41.840
which I've removed
for further dissection.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.800
I'm looking at
the thyroid cartilage.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.960
And the hyoid bone,
in particular the horns.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.160
The horns are compressed...

17:00.320 --> 17:03.440
..and the hyoid bone is fractured.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.080
Does that suggest he was murdered?

17:21.800 --> 17:24.960
Are you meant to be here?
The other students have all gone.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.240
I'm just waiting for Dr Alexander.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.600
She said she'd help me
with my research paper, so...

17:29.600 --> 17:31.480
Well, she might be a while, so...

17:35.160 --> 17:37.560
That's fine.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.120
I'll come back later. Right.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.080
No. Look, it's OK. It's all going
to get sorted. It's...

17:51.800 --> 17:54.080
His wedding's been cancelled
three times.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.920
Sorry again about earlier.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.760
It's just...first it was
the lockdown,

18:04.760 --> 18:07.040
then the second lockdown,
then the venue went bust and, um...

18:08.320 --> 18:10.600
..now she's having second
thoughts. Great.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.000
About getting married? What?!

18:14.000 --> 18:15.640
You married at all?

18:15.640 --> 18:18.560
Not even a bit. Great.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.640
OK. So, my first instincts
with this old boy

18:21.640 --> 18:24.200
is that he was going through
all sorts of pain,

18:24.200 --> 18:27.400
so he thought he'd nick
a few fentanyl patches off the old
sweetie trolley.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.960
How would he have got hold of them?
I mean, surely they would have been
locked away.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.960
Someone also cut the patches up

18:32.960 --> 18:35.280
so the fentanyl was more
rapidly absorbed.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.040
OK. So the care home's
got some questions to answer.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.560
And there's the fractured hyoid.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.840
Yeah, OK. Look, look, I can see
where you're going with this.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.080
There is evidence to suggest that
our guy was drugged

18:44.080 --> 18:46.280
and possibly that he was suffocated
or strangled

18:46.280 --> 18:49.640
because of the bruising on the lips
and the fractures, but how do we
prove that?

18:49.640 --> 18:52.600
I mean, he could as easily
have swallowed the fentanyl
patches himself,

18:52.600 --> 18:55.960
and the fractured hyoid could have
been a result of an injury from
the postmortem.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.680
I mean, come on, you and I both know
what that body's gone through,

18:58.680 --> 19:02.400
some junior technician
fumbling around trying to embalm
the poor sod.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.800
I mean, he probably injected the
formaldehyde in the neck

19:04.800 --> 19:06.160
instead of the groin.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.040
You're right, Detective Sergeant,

19:08.040 --> 19:10.240
the technician did use
the carotid artery.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.880
I'm a genius. I am a genius.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.640
So how do you explain the bleeding
around the fractured hyoid bone?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.440
There's bleeding?

19:23.440 --> 19:26.080
It suggests that there was pressure
on Mr Robson's neck

19:26.080 --> 19:28.120
while he was still alive.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.480
Um...

19:41.200 --> 19:43.160
This is what I love about
you people.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.240
I've just had the police
on the phone.

19:54.240 --> 19:57.800
They want to ask some questions
about the recent death.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.600
What kind of questions?

19:59.600 --> 20:01.280
I don't know.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.480
They wouldn't tell me very much.

20:04.480 --> 20:05.880
About Robbo?

20:05.880 --> 20:08.040
There's no need to worry about that.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.440
Mr Robson died in his sleep.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.320
You and I both know that.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.120
But what... Why would they...? Oh...

20:15.120 --> 20:19.480
Why would they want to come here
if it's not suspicious?

20:19.480 --> 20:22.640
It's just routine questions.
It'll be fine.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.680
It'll be fine.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.960
Any results yet?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.880
Still waiting.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.240
That student's back
in reception again.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.920
You know, the good-looking one.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.320
What, Ollie?

20:59.320 --> 21:00.880
They're post grads, right?

21:01.960 --> 21:04.680
Yeah. They're all doing really well.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.200
You with Jack tomorrow?

21:06.200 --> 21:08.320
Yeah, at the care home.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.920
I was asking him about crime scene
management and he said,

21:10.920 --> 21:14.360
"Why don't you come along?"
I'm looking forward to it. I think.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.840
You'll be fine.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.960
Night. Night. Have a
good one, yeah? You too. OK.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.480
Hi.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.840
I wanted to invite you to our
Halloween party.

21:42.840 --> 21:46.080
Er...that's kind...
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

21:46.080 --> 21:50.120
This department have to go in the
goriest, most disgusting costumes.

21:50.120 --> 21:53.120
And the tradition is that someone
from the faculty

21:53.120 --> 21:55.400
comes and judges them.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.400
With your strong stomach,
you'll be...

21:57.400 --> 21:58.880
You'll be perfect.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.760
Any news on Mr Robson?

22:07.760 --> 22:11.080
Mm. The police and two of my
colleagues are going out to the care
home tomorrow.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.160
Will they find out who did it?

22:13.160 --> 22:14.720
We'll have to wait and see.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.320
At least think about it.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.200
Hello?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.560
You called me?

22:48.560 --> 22:50.960
The, um... The police...

22:52.280 --> 22:54.400
They're looking
into your father's death.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.600
What do you mean?
Why would they do that?

22:56.600 --> 22:58.360
I-I, um...

22:58.360 --> 22:59.560
I don't know.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.640
I'm...

23:03.920 --> 23:05.480
I'm really sorry.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.120
I still can't believe you didn't
tell me

23:07.120 --> 23:09.960
what he was planning to do.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.200
Your sister was here.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.400
What the hell does she want?! Um...
Sorry.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.200
Are you meeting someone?

24:03.200 --> 24:04.880
Oh, I'm in the wrong place.
Don't worry.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.320
Simone was right. Huh?

24:07.320 --> 24:08.880
Simone.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.080
Are you Liz?

24:11.520 --> 24:14.360
Hey, I'm only here because Simone
told me I'd be missing out

24:14.360 --> 24:18.240
if I didn't come...and she'd never
talk to me again.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.960
Ah, well, that might have be
a blessing. She can really talk.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.080
Are they your dancing shoes? Um...

24:26.400 --> 24:27.480
Right.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.360
Tip, tip, toe!

24:32.360 --> 24:34.240
Tippety-toe!

24:34.240 --> 24:36.640
Tip, tip, tip and toe!
You're good.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.280
It's all coming back to me.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.640
Woo! Oh!

24:41.640 --> 24:43.320
Whoa, whoa! You all right?

24:43.320 --> 24:44.920
Is that part of the dance?

24:44.920 --> 24:46.880
One, two, three, four.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.760
One, two, three, four. Ready?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.280
Here we go!

24:56.560 --> 24:58.760
Jack?

24:58.760 --> 25:01.280
What? Wait? Hold on, Dad.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.840
They say there's going
to be a flood...

25:03.840 --> 25:05.120
Oh.

25:08.320 --> 25:10.320
Liz, this is my Dad, Conor.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.720
Hi. Do you want some tea?

25:14.720 --> 25:17.360
Um... That would be great.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.120
Milk? Sugar?

25:19.120 --> 25:20.760
Just milk, thanks.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.680
Oh, I'm sorry!

25:29.680 --> 25:31.760
Simone warned me about your tea.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.280
Uh...I make a wonderful cup
of tea, actually!

25:40.160 --> 25:43.000
Has anyone explained that when
a body is embalmed,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.200
the skin changes colour?

25:45.200 --> 25:48.560
The, um, family liaison officer
warned me.

25:50.160 --> 25:53.640
It's sometimes better to remember
someone as they were.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.000
I... I don't remember him.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.240
OK.

26:03.240 --> 26:06.600
I thought he'd given his body
to the university.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.560
That's right. He did.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.840
So why is he here?

26:11.840 --> 26:14.200
The doctor said it was
natural causes.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.960
What are all these
investigations about?

26:16.960 --> 26:20.120
Well, there have been a few issues
that have come up since,

26:20.120 --> 26:21.800
that do need to be explained.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.680
You think he was murdered?

26:25.680 --> 26:28.280
I'm not able to answer that
at present.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.280
The coroner has asked the police
to investigate.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.520
OK.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.680
Hello, Dad.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.120
Long time, no see.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.360
God, what happened to you?

27:18.800 --> 27:20.160
When my mum died...

27:22.600 --> 27:24.800
..I found myself on top of
a railway bridge

27:24.800 --> 27:27.320
ready to end it all,
just like she did.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.840
I was so convinced it was
all my fault.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.200
I was 15 on the last train
to London.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.400
That's why I'm here.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.320
Hi. Where is she?

27:57.320 --> 27:59.240
My sister. I was told she was here.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.440
Michael Robson?

28:00.440 --> 28:03.600
She has no right to be here!

28:03.600 --> 28:04.760
Michael?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.520
You shouldn't be here!

28:06.520 --> 28:07.960
Um, Mr Robson...

28:07.960 --> 28:09.240
Neither should Dad.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.520
Should we take this
conversation elsewhere?

28:11.520 --> 28:13.440
They think that Dad's death
is unexplained.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.880
Like most of his life.
Why are you here?

28:16.880 --> 28:18.280
He was my Dad too.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.520
And where were you when
I was wiping his arse?

28:20.520 --> 28:22.960
Mopping up his sick?

28:22.960 --> 28:24.520
Have you paid for any of his care?

28:24.520 --> 28:26.520
I wasn't here.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.920
No, you weren't.
No-one was except me.

28:30.880 --> 28:33.960
You know, he kept going on
and on about you,

28:33.960 --> 28:36.280
saying you'd come back.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.760
Well, you're too late.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.840
It's all over now. You hear me?

28:53.400 --> 28:54.800
I'm sorry.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.600
It's fine.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.880
It's fine. He's, um...

28:58.880 --> 29:00.520
He's just upset.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.760
Why do you think he doesn't want
my father donating his body?

29:17.160 --> 29:20.800
I'm sure these questions will be
asked as part of the investigation.

29:22.480 --> 29:23.880
OK, thanks.

29:56.960 --> 29:59.160
Simone, you all right?

29:59.160 --> 30:03.000
Yeah. Just calling,
see how you are.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.080
What's happened?

30:05.120 --> 30:06.320
Nothing.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.560
Shall I cook tonight?

30:09.560 --> 30:13.440
Oh, that'd be lovely.
Great. See you later.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.600
All right, bubs. Bye.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.440
Storm Freddie is due

30:49.440 --> 30:51.760
to hit the west coast
later this evening.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.200
It follows quickly on the heels
of Storm Emily,

30:54.200 --> 30:56.760
that caused extensive flooding
around the country,

30:56.760 --> 30:59.160
with damage to properties
and infrastructure

30:59.160 --> 31:02.440
estimated to be
in the tens of millions of pounds.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.560
Oh!

31:03.560 --> 31:06.680
People in the effected area
are being advised not to travel

31:06.680 --> 31:08.920
unless absolutely necessary,

31:08.920 --> 31:12.640
and, if possible, to move furniture
and treasured possessions upstairs.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.880
What the hell's happening to me?

31:30.280 --> 31:33.320
All right, Jacky Boy?
All right, pal? See you inside? Aye.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.560
Liz had a great night. Ah.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.560
Irish dancing. Really?

31:53.560 --> 31:55.640
Yeah, just sort of came to me.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.760
Got a list of tasks for you today.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.200
Ah. Changing the subject. Nice.

32:04.200 --> 32:07.280
I will be mentoring you
during this investigation.

32:07.280 --> 32:11.080
Your competency will need to be
checked and double-checked.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.840
Is that what Liz said
to you last night?

32:12.840 --> 32:14.600
Wow.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.520
Is the DS here?

32:17.520 --> 32:20.840
Yeah. He's inside, talking
to the manager, Mary Thorpe.

32:20.840 --> 32:24.720
He's going to speak to the doctor
and a few key members of staff also.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.760
We take his lead on this.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.480
What are you implying,
that I might use my initiative? Hm.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.880
Mr Robson's room is in the lodge -
down the way, there.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.040
Still empty, I believe. Heads up.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.080
Thanks.

32:44.400 --> 32:45.760
What?

32:45.760 --> 32:49.440
Er, I've been looking at
a few places for my dad.

32:49.440 --> 32:52.320
Not here, but it's, um...

32:52.320 --> 32:54.840
It's like looking for
a plot in a cemetery.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.360
It doesn't have to be.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.920
There's many people
live in care homes happily.

32:58.920 --> 33:03.080
You know, there's 24-hour care,
they're safe, they're warm... Yeah.

33:03.080 --> 33:06.000
Hello. Hello.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.200
Hi. Who's this, then?

33:09.360 --> 33:12.800
Bob. Bob. He's a bit poorly.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.440
Aw. How old is he?

33:14.440 --> 33:16.120
16.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.240
16? Wow, that's a good age.

33:18.240 --> 33:23.960
My daughter gave him to me when
my husband died. Absolute Godsend.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.040
Nice to meet you, Bob.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.360
Bye, Bob. See ya.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.320
It's coming, Bobby.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.680
It's coming to wash us all clean.

33:42.840 --> 33:45.960
Door handles - don't touch them
unless you absolutely have to,

33:45.960 --> 33:49.320
and, when you do, try to touch
where normal users wouldn't.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.560
"Normal users"? Yeah.

33:51.560 --> 33:54.080
Think about the perpetrator.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.840
Walk in their shoes.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.480
Imagine their actions.

33:57.480 --> 34:01.440
Learn to spot the things
others might not see.

34:01.440 --> 34:05.080
Look at your crime scene
from all perspectives.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.760
Take in all possibilities.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.280
Don't turn the light on
without checking the switch first,

34:10.280 --> 34:14.280
for blood and prints,
and remember to look up.

34:14.280 --> 34:17.640
The best clues are often above
or behind you.

34:17.640 --> 34:21.760
I'll talk about walking up steps
and setting up a work space later.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.600
Check that with the CSM, obviously.
Obviously.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.080
Rule number one -

34:26.080 --> 34:29.200
always go to the loo
before you go out to a scene.

34:29.200 --> 34:32.400
Now you tell me.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.480
Can I help you?

34:33.480 --> 34:35.920
Hello. I'm Jack Hodgson
and this is Simone Tyler.

34:35.920 --> 34:39.120
Ah, from The Lyell? That's right.
I'm Dr Young.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.720
Who's there?

34:40.720 --> 34:43.440
Don't worry yourself, Derek.

34:43.440 --> 34:46.240
We do not want to overly concern
the residents.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.880
You seem a little young
to be joining us, but... Derek!

34:50.880 --> 34:52.720
..there's room for a littl'un.

34:52.720 --> 34:54.760
Derek, behave yourself.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.120
Getting jealous, my dear heart?
He used to be an actor.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.560
"Used to be"?!

34:59.560 --> 35:02.160
Actors never die,
they simply change agents.

35:02.160 --> 35:05.680
I didn't order a bouncy castle.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.320
Sorry.

35:09.320 --> 35:11.720
Word of advice - never get married.
OK.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.280
I told the manager, Mrs Thorpe,

35:13.280 --> 35:15.960
that you're going be opening
the controlled medicine cabinet.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.440
Right. There's this one

35:17.440 --> 35:20.600
and there's one on the first floor
landing of the main building.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.920
Who else has keys to this?

35:21.920 --> 35:26.600
Myself and Mrs Thorpe and Amrita,
the senior care assistant.

35:26.600 --> 35:29.800
OK. Mrs Thorpe is going to find
the drugs books

35:29.800 --> 35:32.120
and the visitor book -
which you both need to sign -

35:32.120 --> 35:34.120
but we're also going to need
the incident book.

35:34.120 --> 35:38.040
Want to take a look? Yeah. Sure.

35:38.040 --> 35:39.400
She's up at the main house.

35:40.720 --> 35:42.600
Sorry.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.920
Hello.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.920
Hello, love.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.400
What's a pinata?

35:47.400 --> 35:48.440
Robbo?

35:50.160 --> 35:53.240
Who are you? Where's Robbo?

35:53.240 --> 35:54.680
My name's Jack Hodgson.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.000
Come along, Derek.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.840
I heard him. Yes, of course you did,
my darling.

35:58.840 --> 36:02.680
Sounded like someone
was choking him to death.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.680
Was it you?

36:06.680 --> 36:08.040
Come along, Derek.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.640
Early onset dementia.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.960
And he's taking those painkillers
that make you go a bit doolally.

36:34.560 --> 36:38.760
He's been gone for two months.
You won't find anything.

36:38.760 --> 36:41.200
When you leave here,
you leave without a trace.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.080
I'm Beattie Elletson.
My husband was a copper.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.600
I'm not police.

36:48.600 --> 36:49.800
I didn't say you were.

36:51.320 --> 36:52.480
Follow me.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.360
Derek seemed to think
he was strangled.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.680
Robbo's wife was haunting him.

37:04.680 --> 37:08.360
From what I could gather,
it wasn't a very happy marriage.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.440
Did you know she killed herself?

37:11.560 --> 37:13.800
Some 20 years ago.

37:13.800 --> 37:18.880
I think that both his children
were deeply affected

37:18.880 --> 37:22.080
by the things that happened
all those years ago,

37:22.080 --> 37:24.440
mainly because Robbo
refused to talk about it.

37:26.560 --> 37:28.880
His dead wife talked to him, though.

37:31.360 --> 37:35.480
I could hear him shouting at her
to leave him alone.

37:39.440 --> 37:42.320
It's sad, really.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.680
Still, I suppose
we all have our ghosts.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.080
How long have you been here?

37:47.080 --> 37:49.040
Longer than expected.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.400
Much of the time, I'm fine.
But then...

37:52.400 --> 37:54.400
..suddenly, I can't breathe

37:54.400 --> 37:58.160
and then it's all blues and twos
and everybody's in a panic.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.360
I'm a bloody miracle. Hm!

38:05.520 --> 38:07.720
I, er...had better get back to work.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.640
Robbo's been dead some two months.

38:12.640 --> 38:17.720
We do still have his details,
but we've taken it off the database.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.360
I'll have to find them.

38:19.360 --> 38:24.280
Great. And the incident and
the visitors book would be great.

38:24.280 --> 38:27.600
Can't you see how understaffed
we are?

38:27.600 --> 38:30.240
I understand,
but I'm just doing my job.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.320
You can look through
the visitors book,

38:34.320 --> 38:36.240
but you can't take it with you.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.760
Oh. I don't...I don't see why not.

38:39.760 --> 38:42.280
Well, you wouldn't, would you?

38:42.280 --> 38:45.360
You haven't been here
these past 18 months,

38:45.360 --> 38:48.920
going through what we've
been forced to go through.

38:48.920 --> 38:53.360
I'm sorry about Robbo,
he was a much-loved resident,

38:53.360 --> 38:56.000
but you'll have to
give me more time.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.280
Oh, Mrs Thorpe? Coming, Dot.

38:59.480 --> 39:02.960
Those records would be so useful.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.640
Mrs Thorpe!

39:04.640 --> 39:06.000
Yes, coming.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.320
I'll get someone to bring over
the incident book

39:10.320 --> 39:12.400
from the lodge for you. Thank you.

39:29.720 --> 39:32.640
The incident book. Thank you.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.120
Can I ask what it is
you're looking for, exactly?

39:35.120 --> 39:38.000
Well, we believe Mr Robson swallowed
a fentanyl patch.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.080
Fentanyl? Mm.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.360
That's a Schedule 2 medicine.

39:41.360 --> 39:44.480
If we had any, it would have
been under lock and key.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.160
Yeah. Well,
the night Mr Robson died,

39:47.160 --> 39:49.640
the night
you prescribed him antibiotics,

39:49.640 --> 39:52.000
you weren't actually here.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.240
No. I was informed of the symptoms
and prescribed accordingly.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.960
Is that usual practice?

39:59.520 --> 40:00.800
In the last year or so,

40:00.800 --> 40:03.920
it's become harder
and harder to be everywhere at once.

40:03.920 --> 40:06.320
I called in the next morning.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.680
When Mr Robson was already dead.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.200
Come to arrest me?

40:39.200 --> 40:41.040
For medicinal purposes only, is it?

40:45.400 --> 40:48.760
Get a smoke in
before the storm comes.

40:48.760 --> 40:51.040
You know
you could cause an explosion

40:51.040 --> 40:53.360
using a naked flame around oxygen?

40:53.360 --> 40:57.120
Next you'll be telling me smoking
40 a day is bad for my health.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.520
Found anything?

41:03.520 --> 41:04.560
Very much doubt it.

41:06.080 --> 41:08.080
Want my DNA?

41:09.200 --> 41:11.720
Not sure we have reasonable grounds
for that, do we?

41:13.480 --> 41:19.520
My husband, bless him,
used to think DNA was...cheating.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.960
Did he?

41:24.040 --> 41:28.000
You think Robbo
was unlawfully killed?

41:28.000 --> 41:29.200
I don't know.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.560
If he was,
we're going to have a hard time

41:32.560 --> 41:34.400
proving who was responsible for it.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.320
Robbo liked his puzzles.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.000
His little games.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.360
He'd have been laughing at us now.

42:28.840 --> 42:32.360
Mr Robson was prescribed 20mg
morphine capsules three times a day

42:32.360 --> 42:35.720
that could be topped up with
Oramorph for breakthrough pain.

42:35.720 --> 42:38.720
Dr Young prescribed according to
the pain management ladder -

42:38.720 --> 42:41.160
paracetamol to co-codamol
to morphine -

42:41.160 --> 42:44.360
but there's no indication that he
went as far as prescribing fentanyl.

42:44.360 --> 42:47.120
So how did it get
into Mr Robson's gut?

42:47.120 --> 42:50.320
If these records are correct,
and they are from the pharmacy,

42:50.320 --> 42:53.800
the care home haven't had fentanyl
since before Mr Robson arrived.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.880
The man in the room next to Robson

42:55.880 --> 42:58.600
said he heard him being strangled
or suffocated.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.440
Yeah, I spoke with him. Derek.
Uh-huh.

43:00.440 --> 43:03.000
Come on. You and I both know
that a resident with dementia,

43:03.000 --> 43:05.040
their evidence isn't
going to carry much weight.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.440
And yet we know
that the fractured hyoid bone

43:07.440 --> 43:10.520
points to Mr Robson being strangled.
Yeah. All right.

43:10.520 --> 43:13.840
Dr Young wasn't there
the night before Robson died.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.200
Who administered
the antibiotics he prescribed?

43:16.200 --> 43:19.560
Well, according to the rota,
senior care assistant Amrita Naidu.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.800
It was her day off today.
I'll speak to her tomorrow.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.680
The room was clean as a whistle.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.880
I accept that
it would have had a deep clean

43:26.880 --> 43:30.200
soon after the body was removed,
but there was barely a speck of dust

43:30.200 --> 43:33.000
and the smell of cleaning products?
Like napalm.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.880
There's a presence of
morphine metabolites in his toenail

43:35.880 --> 43:38.080
dating back
to around eight months ago.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.520
And there's no previous indication
of fentanyl,

43:40.520 --> 43:43.680
suggesting that this is the first
time he was exposed to the patches.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.400
Did the fentanyl kill him?

43:53.400 --> 43:56.280
It would have been enough
to render him unconscious.

43:56.280 --> 43:58.600
And then he was strangled
or suffocated?

44:14.600 --> 44:16.200
Michael?

44:20.640 --> 44:21.680
Michael?

44:25.640 --> 44:27.280
Michael!

44:52.840 --> 44:56.080
Michael, it's me, Amrita.

44:56.080 --> 45:00.880
I...I helped you
when you needed help.

45:00.880 --> 45:04.880
I risked my job helping you
with your father.

45:04.880 --> 45:10.240
I need you to help me,
please, Michael. Please.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.920
Guys?

45:28.800 --> 45:31.280
"I know who killed Robbo"?
Who sent you this?

45:31.280 --> 45:33.600
Must be someone from the care home.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.320
You gave them your number?

45:35.320 --> 45:36.560
Is that unethical?

45:36.560 --> 45:38.800
Who did you give your number to?

45:38.800 --> 45:42.200
Well, I put it in the visitors book.

45:48.040 --> 45:49.440
Yeah, they're not answering.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.400
OK, send me a screen
grab of that number,

45:51.400 --> 45:53.040
I'll get in touch with
the phone company.

45:53.040 --> 45:55.160
And we need to get back
to the care home now.

45:59.760 --> 46:04.280
I sense I haven't passed my
assessment with flying colours.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.800
Where have you been?

46:24.800 --> 46:26.320
I saw you.

46:26.320 --> 46:30.960
If you leave now, they WILL get
suspicious and come after you.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.800
I can't protect you.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.320
They're going to blame me.

46:35.320 --> 46:36.600
No.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.360
No, I will not let that happen.

46:41.960 --> 46:44.560
We've got to get the residents
out of the lodge

46:44.560 --> 46:46.240
and up to the main house.

46:46.240 --> 46:47.280
Please.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.120
We are doing everything
we can to restore power

47:03.120 --> 47:05.960
but I would urge people
to stay where they are,

47:05.960 --> 47:07.680
upstairs if they have one.

47:07.680 --> 47:10.200
Our teams are rescuing
as many people as possible.

47:10.200 --> 47:11.560
Just hold tight,

47:11.560 --> 47:13.800
cos whilst the rain is
beginning to subside,

47:13.800 --> 47:16.480
water volume continues to grow.

47:16.480 --> 47:19.200
The flood defences
to the west have been breached,

47:19.200 --> 47:22.280
which means a large volume
of water is heading our way

47:22.280 --> 47:25.280
and will almost certainly have
a devastating impact.

47:49.920 --> 47:54.080
Oh! You scared me to death.
Who is it?

47:54.080 --> 47:58.320
Oh, it's you. You look incredible.

47:58.320 --> 48:00.960
Your outfit's, er...

48:00.960 --> 48:03.760
I mean, wow. Respect.

48:03.760 --> 48:08.560
You know you're here to judge the
competition, not to win it?

48:08.560 --> 48:11.000
Whoa!
Come on, let's get you a drink.

48:26.440 --> 48:30.320
..storm force winds are still
pushing across England and Wales.

48:30.320 --> 48:32.800
What are you going to do?

48:32.800 --> 48:34.880
It's clearly too deep.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.240
What's the worst that can happen?

48:38.240 --> 48:40.760
Irreparable damage to
the electrical system,

48:40.760 --> 48:43.000
water getting into
the engine and it seizing,

48:43.000 --> 48:44.640
or we just get swept away.

48:46.480 --> 48:47.680
Same number.

48:49.640 --> 48:52.520
"I think they're going
to kill again." Drive.

49:07.880 --> 49:09.280
Thank you.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.600
You haven't judged our costumes yet.

49:15.760 --> 49:18.280
Come on, judge. Take a seat.

49:19.880 --> 49:21.400
How am I supposed to judge them

49:21.400 --> 49:23.640
when I don't even know
who Henry is meant to be?

49:23.640 --> 49:26.320
You have to guess.
Wrong answer gets a shot.

49:26.320 --> 49:29.680
Um... Psycho?

49:29.680 --> 49:31.680
Jessica Fletcher, who else?

49:31.680 --> 49:34.480
I thought this was supposed
to be a Halloween party.

49:34.480 --> 49:38.280
There's going to be a very bloody
murder and I'm here to solve it.

49:41.440 --> 49:45.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's your night off. Stop working.

49:46.440 --> 49:50.320
Drink, drink, drink, drink...

49:57.160 --> 49:59.480
OK, give it back. Nope.

49:59.480 --> 50:01.560
Come on. It could be important.

50:01.560 --> 50:04.440
I'm not finished yet. Please.

50:04.440 --> 50:05.840
Next question.

50:08.600 --> 50:09.800
Are you single?

50:14.480 --> 50:15.560
Give it.

50:15.560 --> 50:18.040
The main house
is on higher ground.

50:18.040 --> 50:21.640
Let go of me. Come on, Derek,
we're just trying to save you.

50:21.640 --> 50:25.480
Save me from what?
The flood, darling.

50:25.480 --> 50:31.760
We need to get you all out
of the lodge. Let it take me.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.880
Take us all... This is my home!

50:36.080 --> 50:37.720
 Hey, Derek.

50:38.720 --> 50:40.120
Hi.

50:40.120 --> 50:44.560
They're trying to hurt me
like they hurt Robbo.

50:44.560 --> 50:47.680
Derek, there's a storm.
What shall we take?

50:47.680 --> 50:51.800
What's the most precious
thing you have?

50:57.200 --> 50:58.960
What's happening?

51:02.960 --> 51:06.440
 We have to go now.
I'm scared.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.880
 Come on, Derek. This way.

51:10.880 --> 51:14.520
Me too, but I think
we can do it together.

51:20.160 --> 51:26.680
 Every inch a king.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.200
 My poor Bobby's not well.

51:31.200 --> 51:34.720
 Let me take him.
No, no, he's in pain.

52:16.240 --> 52:21.640
 Blow, winds,
and crack your cheeks.

52:21.640 --> 52:23.840
Rage!

52:23.840 --> 52:29.080
Blow, you cataracts and
hurricanoes...

52:29.080 --> 52:31.240
 Brilliant,
brilliant, my liege,

52:31.240 --> 52:33.280
but we really need
to get inside now.

52:35.200 --> 52:42.640
I am a very foolish fond old man.

52:44.080 --> 52:46.840
Four score and upward,
not an hour, more or less,

52:46.840 --> 52:50.760
and, to deal plainly,

52:50.760 --> 52:53.320
I...fear

52:53.320 --> 52:57.160
I am not in my perfect mind.

52:57.160 --> 53:00.960
All right, well, let's get you in.
Come on, Derek. Up you get. Please.

53:03.120 --> 53:09.600
They told me I was everything!

53:11.000 --> 53:16.720
Tis a lie! I am not ague-proof.

53:18.200 --> 53:21.880
Jack, it's Steve.
Hope you're able to pick this up.

53:21.880 --> 53:24.200
We traced the fingerprints that
you took at the care home.

53:24.200 --> 53:28.200
One set has a problem.
It belongs to an Amrita Naidu.

53:28.200 --> 53:30.320
She works at the care home

53:30.320 --> 53:32.880
but that's not her real name.

53:34.720 --> 53:38.520
She could be the killer mentioned
in the message sent to Simone.

53:53.560 --> 53:54.600
Ja...

54:10.040 --> 54:12.440
I think his hip

54:12.440 --> 54:14.640
has broken or something.

54:14.640 --> 54:17.320
He had an operation last year.

54:18.480 --> 54:21.480
You're right, he's not doing well.

54:21.480 --> 54:24.200
The vet said it was
only a matter of time.

54:24.200 --> 54:26.920
How are you with a syringe, Jack?

54:26.920 --> 54:28.760
We need to get everyone upstairs.

54:28.760 --> 54:31.760
There's warm clothes
up there as well.

54:31.760 --> 54:34.200
Will you get her back
in her room, please?

54:40.720 --> 54:44.120
It's for the dog. Beattie's asked.

54:44.120 --> 54:47.360
In my early life I was a vet.
I would do it myself but...

54:47.360 --> 54:50.240
You can't kill the dog.

54:51.600 --> 54:53.600
Poor fool is hanged.

54:53.600 --> 54:55.040
My poor Bobby.

54:55.040 --> 54:58.600
He's feeling so bad,

54:58.600 --> 55:01.640
in such pain.

55:01.640 --> 55:04.640
It's for the best. I know it.

55:04.640 --> 55:06.840
Come on, everyone.

55:06.840 --> 55:08.720
Please be careful.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.840
It's OK.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.440
It's been estimated

55:52.440 --> 55:56.040
that a month's worth of rain has
fallen in the last 48 hours...

55:58.520 --> 56:00.000
Is that you, Jack?

56:10.120 --> 56:11.880
Well done.

56:11.880 --> 56:13.280
Not easy.

56:21.760 --> 56:24.240
Pop him down there.
Mary will take care of it.

56:31.680 --> 56:34.960
You're freezing. Come on.
We need to get you upstairs.

56:51.520 --> 56:56.120
You know, I don't think
I can manage this on my own.

57:08.120 --> 57:10.920
Then I'm going to have to carry you.

57:10.920 --> 57:12.320
I thought you'd never ask.

57:19.920 --> 57:21.200
There we go.

57:26.160 --> 57:28.280
Jack?

57:31.440 --> 57:33.840
If the town has been hit
as badly as we have,

57:33.840 --> 57:35.680
we could be trapped
out here for days.

57:38.440 --> 57:40.320
We need to get you warm.

57:40.320 --> 57:43.720
How are you going to do that, Jack,
with no electricity?

57:47.960 --> 57:51.040
Oh, thank you. OK?

58:12.720 --> 58:20.200
# Testator silens

58:21.760 --> 58:28.800
# Costestes e spiritu

58:28.800 --> 58:36.800
# Silencium. #
