"So,

00:03.883 --> 00:06.973
on behalf of the Denver Campsite Girls,

00:06.975 --> 00:09.312
please accept these cookies,

00:09.314 --> 00:12.719
along with our endorsement
for State Assembly".

00:12.721 --> 00:14.777
Well, that is so nice.

00:14.779 --> 00:15.893
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:15.895 --> 00:17.020
Hi.

00:17.022 --> 00:18.855
- Oh, wow, that's a lot of cookies.
- Yeah.

00:18.857 --> 00:21.764
Good thing I brought home a diary cow.

00:21.766 --> 00:24.849
The, uh, the Campsite Girls endorsed me.

00:24.851 --> 00:27.092
Congratulations. Uh, well,
speaking of endorsements,

00:27.094 --> 00:29.645
- what about the teachers union?
- Should be any day now.

00:29.647 --> 00:31.463
Yeah. So, uh, so how was bowling?

00:31.465 --> 00:33.131
- Oh, it was super awesome.
- Mm-hmm.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.734
I think we might win the
church tournament this year.

00:34.736 --> 00:37.386
Oh, babe, you always have so
much fun when we go bowling.

00:37.388 --> 00:38.944
You know who didn't
have any fun? The pins.

00:38.946 --> 00:41.282
They just stood there.

00:41.284 --> 00:43.150
Okay, excuse me.

00:43.152 --> 00:44.702
I bowled a 150.

00:44.704 --> 00:46.913
Wow, that's the best you've ever done.

00:46.915 --> 00:48.080
Over three games.

00:50.067 --> 00:52.460
Wow, that's the best you've ever done.

00:53.619 --> 00:55.175
All right, well, we got to go.

00:55.177 --> 00:56.655
Thank you for the ride, Dad.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.824
Oh, you mind if we, um... ?

00:57.826 --> 00:59.301
Yeah, help yourself, go ahead.

00:59.303 --> 01:01.220
Not the Ginger Bunnies!

01:02.706 --> 01:05.123
Well, looks like it's gonna be

01:05.125 --> 01:07.324
another embarrassing
year for Team Baxter.

01:07.326 --> 01:08.335
Oh, yeah, who cares?

01:08.337 --> 01:09.920
It's a church fundraiser.
Why do you have

01:09.922 --> 01:11.180
to make everything so competitive?

01:11.182 --> 01:14.007
Because losing is like death.

01:15.311 --> 01:17.247
You know, when the girls were little,

01:17.249 --> 01:19.179
we did these tournaments just for fun.

01:19.181 --> 01:21.440
But then once they got
good and started winning,

01:21.442 --> 01:24.017
you forgot about fun.

01:24.019 --> 01:25.852
Are you saying Mandy's a good bowler?

01:25.854 --> 01:27.687
Hell yeah.

01:27.689 --> 01:29.815
She's got the wingspan of a pterodactyl.

01:29.817 --> 01:32.818
Literally, when she lets that ball go,

01:32.820 --> 01:35.755
she's already at the pins.

01:35.757 --> 01:37.413
I'll have to challenge her

01:37.415 --> 01:38.970
- to a game sometime.
- Yep.

01:38.972 --> 01:40.244
You bowl?

01:40.246 --> 01:41.871
Oh, yeah.

01:43.163 --> 01:45.539
And I'm really, really good.

01:45.541 --> 01:48.124
I love the sound when I get a strike.

01:48.126 --> 01:50.770
It's like an explosion.

01:50.772 --> 01:53.180
Yeah.

01:53.182 --> 01:56.942
How many times during a match
do you get that explosion?

01:56.944 --> 01:59.094
Hmm, eight or nine.

01:59.096 --> 02:00.971
- God, I miss it.
- Yeah.

02:02.140 --> 02:03.223
No, Mike.

02:03.225 --> 02:04.499
Yes, Vanessa.

02:04.501 --> 02:06.586
You already have Kyle on the team.

02:06.588 --> 02:08.562
There's a mechanical horse
out front of the bowling alley.

02:08.564 --> 02:10.271
I'll give him some
quarters. He'll be happy.

02:10.274 --> 02:12.449
No!

02:19.283 --> 02:21.700
Hey, Paul, got a minute to talk?

02:21.702 --> 02:23.618
Well, I was praying, but you're here,

02:23.620 --> 02:24.980
so that didn't work.

02:26.498 --> 02:28.665
Listen, that was a great service today.

02:28.667 --> 02:31.710
You know, I missed Alice, though,
on the organ, you know?

02:31.712 --> 02:34.179
She really jams on "Amazing Grace", huh?

02:34.181 --> 02:36.065
Yeah.

02:36.067 --> 02:37.983
Poor thing had to have
carpal tunnel surgery.

02:37.985 --> 02:39.926
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

02:39.928 --> 02:42.053
And with the bowling
tournament coming up,

02:42.055 --> 02:43.513
she won't be able to bowl.

02:43.515 --> 02:45.199
Heck, heck, heck.

02:45.201 --> 02:47.392
And she's your top scorer.

02:47.394 --> 02:49.745
Heckity-heck, heck.

02:51.356 --> 02:54.733
That was a fun skit,
Mike. What do you want?

02:54.735 --> 02:56.544
I don't want anything.
I-I'm here to help.

02:56.546 --> 02:58.764
Listen, if you need an extra player,

02:58.766 --> 03:00.422
I'm willing to let Kyle go.

03:00.424 --> 03:03.158
Well, I've seen Kyle
bowl, and as a pastor,

03:03.160 --> 03:05.076
I know I'm not supposed
to pass judgement,

03:05.078 --> 03:06.929
but he sucks.

03:06.931 --> 03:09.748
Wasn't the sermon today

03:09.750 --> 03:13.385
about how the congregation
is just one big family?

03:13.387 --> 03:14.895
I thought you were napping.

03:14.897 --> 03:16.272
I dip in and out.

03:17.569 --> 03:19.259
But since he's joining the ministry,

03:19.261 --> 03:21.885
he's actually part of the church family.

03:21.887 --> 03:24.262
You know, Mike, Jesus
hung out with the lepers

03:24.264 --> 03:28.016
and the prostitutes, but
nobody likes a bad bowler.

03:28.018 --> 03:31.144
Yeah, but Jesus never
got a chance to bowl.

03:31.146 --> 03:32.729
I mean, they won't rent you shoes

03:32.731 --> 03:34.248
if you're not wearing socks.

03:35.839 --> 03:37.745
- Oh, hey, Mr. B.
- Hey.

03:37.747 --> 03:38.985
- Rev P.
- Hey, Kyle.

03:38.987 --> 03:40.570
I'm just returning the
Sunday school books.

03:40.572 --> 03:42.423
You know, Kyle, we were
just talking about you,

03:42.425 --> 03:45.325
and how important you've
become to the church family.

03:45.327 --> 03:46.885
And you are.

03:46.887 --> 03:49.597
But not near as important as
you are to the Baxter family.

03:49.599 --> 03:51.498
No, no, no, no, no. I'm
just saying that, you know,

03:51.500 --> 03:54.101
with the bowling tournament
coming up, if... if the reverend

03:54.103 --> 03:56.878
needs you on the church team,
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.340
Oh, I can't let you do that, Mike.

04:00.342 --> 04:02.008
How would it look if you're more

04:02.010 --> 04:03.760
self-sacrificing than your pastor?

04:03.762 --> 04:06.429
It would look like the pastor's sermons

04:06.431 --> 04:09.274
have hit their mark.

04:09.276 --> 04:11.393
That's something to pray on.

04:11.395 --> 04:14.020
Yeah, but, uh...

04:15.491 --> 04:17.607
Would you look at that.

04:17.608 --> 04:20.819
Mike and I fighting over
who gets you on their team.

04:20.821 --> 04:23.397
Yeah, sounds like the loser gets Kyle.

04:25.117 --> 04:27.200
Okay, I'm gonna tell you the truth.

04:27.202 --> 04:28.510
As a bowler, you're terrible.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.540
Yeah, you know, it's not news to me...

04:33.542 --> 04:35.959
but it still hurts to hear.

04:35.961 --> 04:38.211
But as a person,

04:38.213 --> 04:40.922
I can't think of anybody
I'd rather have on my team.

04:40.924 --> 04:42.516
Oh, thanks.

04:42.518 --> 04:44.092
Hey, I won't let you down, Reverend.

04:44.094 --> 04:45.986
Oh, it's not me.

04:45.988 --> 04:48.355
God's the captain of our team.

04:48.357 --> 04:49.698
No pressure.

04:54.357 --> 04:56.564
Hey, did you guys see this?

04:56.566 --> 04:59.357
Uh, there's a prison
break in Cañon City.

04:59.359 --> 05:01.651
"Prison Break in Cañon City"?

05:01.653 --> 05:06.093
That's my favorite song by Johnny Cash.

05:06.095 --> 05:08.127
Yeah, I guess the guy was from Denver.

05:08.129 --> 05:09.868
They think he might be headed this way.

05:09.870 --> 05:12.669
Oh. I don't think we have
anything to worry about.

05:12.671 --> 05:16.648
It says here this guy
is nonviolent and 85.

05:17.919 --> 05:19.794
- Ooh. 85?
- Huh.

05:19.796 --> 05:23.223
Maybe it wasn't an escape.
Maybe he just wandered away.

05:23.225 --> 05:24.841
Yeah.

05:24.843 --> 05:26.986
He's not on the run.
He's more on the shuffle.

05:28.897 --> 05:32.265
They had to call out
the FBI and the AARP.

05:34.019 --> 05:36.519
You know... you two are hilarious.

05:36.521 --> 05:38.914
You should get a podcast
that no one listens to.

05:40.659 --> 05:42.584
What was that? Is he mad?

05:42.586 --> 05:45.004
No, no. When he's mad,
he slams the door.

05:45.006 --> 05:47.047
Okay.

05:51.286 --> 05:52.331
- Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.816
Uh, I was told Kyle was up here.

05:53.818 --> 05:54.988
I wanted to give him his bowling shirt.

05:54.990 --> 05:57.016
He told me you put him on the team.

05:57.018 --> 05:58.458
You're a better man than I.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.677
Well, what can I say?

06:00.679 --> 06:02.629
It was a low bar.

06:02.631 --> 06:04.839
Why, uh... why do you have two shirts?

06:04.841 --> 06:07.412
Oh, well, with Alice
recovering from her surgery,

06:07.414 --> 06:09.159
her husband decided he didn't
want to bowl without her.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.303
You know, they're one of those couples

06:10.305 --> 06:11.513
likes to do everything together.

06:11.515 --> 06:14.071
Gross.

06:14.073 --> 06:17.672
Yeah, so a second spot on
the church team opened up,

06:17.674 --> 06:19.729
and luckily I know another couple

06:19.731 --> 06:22.199
who insists on doing
everything together.

06:22.201 --> 06:24.201
Oh, no, you didn't.

06:24.203 --> 06:26.578
Oh, yes, I did.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.622
You took my pterodactyl?

06:29.917 --> 06:32.009
Hey, Dad. You hear I got drafted?

06:33.495 --> 06:36.296
You-you can't. Y-You're on Team Baxter.

06:36.298 --> 06:39.104
You know, the people that didn't
leave you at the Grand Canyon

06:39.106 --> 06:41.709
that year you were being
such a pain in the ass?

06:41.711 --> 06:43.391
Yeah, I know, I know,

06:43.393 --> 06:45.939
but when Kyle joined the
church team, I had to join.

06:45.941 --> 06:48.517
A wife can't be compelled
to bowl against her husband.

06:48.519 --> 06:49.777
It is the law.

06:51.238 --> 06:52.571
I'm a Holy Bowler.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.934
- I picked the name.
- Yeah.

06:57.936 --> 07:00.904
It's gonna look good on a trophy.

07:00.906 --> 07:02.981
I'll see you, Mike.

07:02.983 --> 07:04.732
So, all this time

07:04.734 --> 07:07.944
I've been trying to make
friends with the wrong guy.

07:07.946 --> 07:09.755
Hey there.

07:11.586 --> 07:14.562
You remember, me, Mike
Baxter, from the '80s, right?

07:20.879 --> 07:24.355
"And I promise to uphold
the standards and ideals

07:24.357 --> 07:26.563
of this august body".

07:26.565 --> 07:29.215
I'm preparing a statement for when

07:29.217 --> 07:31.885
the teachers union gives me
their endorsement tomorrow.

07:31.887 --> 07:33.845
Well, aren't we the confident one?

07:33.847 --> 07:35.989
Well, you know, Mike, I'm
a single-issue candidate.

07:35.991 --> 07:38.951
If I can't get the teachers,
my other speech is, "Buh-bye".

07:40.687 --> 07:44.063
Well, I got you something
all the teachers I know love:

07:44.065 --> 07:45.916
booze.

07:46.919 --> 07:48.693
- Fancy.
- Yeah.

07:48.695 --> 07:50.236
Wow, what's the occasion?

07:50.238 --> 07:51.755
Well, a husband doesn't
need any occasion

07:51.757 --> 07:53.823
to give his wife a
little treasure like that.

07:53.825 --> 07:55.723
I'm sorry.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.252
I didn't mean "occasion".
I meant, "What do you want?"

07:59.254 --> 08:01.420
Why does everybody
think I want something

08:01.422 --> 08:02.790
just because I'm being nice?

08:02.792 --> 08:05.710
Because you need a reason.

08:05.712 --> 08:07.921
So this doesn't have anything to do

08:07.923 --> 08:11.424
with Mandy switching from
Team Baxter to Team Jesus?

08:11.426 --> 08:14.361
Uh, y-you heard about that, huh?

08:14.363 --> 08:16.271
Uh, yeah, yeah. You know,
thanks for the wine,

08:16.273 --> 08:18.256
but I am not bowling for your team.

08:18.258 --> 08:19.724
Give me one good reason.

08:19.726 --> 08:22.602
You're a crazy person when
it comes to competition.

08:22.604 --> 08:24.187
All you care about is winning.

08:24.189 --> 08:25.897
There's no fun in it.

08:25.899 --> 08:28.008
Wow. You really had
those ready, didn't you?

08:29.527 --> 08:31.194
Well, there's nothing
wrong with winning.

08:31.196 --> 08:33.413
You wanted to win the
state assembly, right?

08:33.414 --> 08:35.923
Yeah, which is why I don't
need another thing on my plate

08:35.924 --> 08:37.676
- that feels like life and death, okay?
- This isn't gonna be

08:37.678 --> 08:40.804
life and death. This is
gonna be fun, fun, fun.

08:42.164 --> 08:44.057
- Really?
- Yes.

08:44.058 --> 08:47.603
I mean, it could be
fun, fun, fun... fun.

08:49.923 --> 08:53.058
Ah, what do I have to
do to get you to do this?

08:53.060 --> 08:56.334
You could say, "It doesn't matter..."

08:56.336 --> 08:58.137
- Uh-huh.
- "... if we win or lose".

08:58.139 --> 08:59.948
Okay. Okay.

09:02.811 --> 09:04.477
You have to say it.

09:04.479 --> 09:06.246
Oh. It doesn't...

09:06.248 --> 09:08.022
It doesn't matter...

09:08.024 --> 09:09.583
blah... if we...

09:10.494 --> 09:12.402
What?!

09:12.404 --> 09:14.904
Eh, it doesn't matter if we... l-l-lose,

09:14.906 --> 09:16.572
lo...

09:16.574 --> 09:19.103
Lose, lose, lose. You happy?

09:19.105 --> 09:21.887
Yeah. Now, that was fun, fun, fun.

09:21.889 --> 09:24.339
Hey, you guys. So, uh, Mike,

09:24.341 --> 09:26.132
Kris tells me you need some bowlers.

09:26.134 --> 09:28.510
Reporting for duty.

09:28.512 --> 09:30.053
I didn't know you bowled.

09:30.055 --> 09:31.327
Yeah, growing up in Canada,

09:31.329 --> 09:33.065
I was on the high school curling team.

09:33.067 --> 09:35.383
Pretty sure it's the same skill set.

09:35.385 --> 09:38.386
No, Mr. Maple Leaf, it's not.

09:38.388 --> 09:40.680
Sliding a teakettle filled with concrete

09:40.682 --> 09:44.533
across a frozen lake is not
even in the same ballpark.

09:44.535 --> 09:46.182
You need bowlers for Team Baxter.

09:46.184 --> 09:48.185
- Yeah.
- It's a family tournament. I'm family.

09:48.187 --> 09:49.737
- What's the problem?
- I don't want to take a chance

09:49.739 --> 09:50.982
on somebody who's never bowled before.

09:50.984 --> 09:53.234
Oh, really? And why is that?

09:53.236 --> 09:56.195
Uh, because winning is the
only thing that matters?

09:56.197 --> 09:58.509
No. No, it has nothing
to do with winning.

09:58.511 --> 10:00.199
It's not winning. This is more...

10:00.201 --> 10:02.511
more of a... a-a safety issue.

10:04.164 --> 10:05.663
Okay, how about this?

10:05.665 --> 10:07.307
A bowl-off between Jen and me.

10:07.309 --> 10:09.226
Winner joins Team Baxter.

10:14.266 --> 10:17.008
Jen, Jen, are you really a good bowler?

10:17.010 --> 10:19.260
I'm a great bowler.

10:19.262 --> 10:20.487
Yeah.

10:21.639 --> 10:23.481
Okay.

10:23.483 --> 10:25.910
All right, little bowl-off.

10:25.912 --> 10:27.542
Winner on Team Baxter.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.205
Not that winning is everything.
The important thing...

10:30.207 --> 10:32.291
that we only have...

10:36.963 --> 10:38.786
I can't believe they still haven't found

10:38.788 --> 10:40.382
that old guy who escaped.

10:40.384 --> 10:41.880
They should set up a roadblock

10:41.882 --> 10:43.868
around every early bird special in town.

10:46.807 --> 10:49.632
Hey, what's the matter?
You looking for Ed?

10:49.634 --> 10:51.283
No, I'm just afraid we hurt his feelings

10:51.285 --> 10:52.802
because of all the old jokes.

10:52.804 --> 10:54.888
No, no, no, no. Ed's got a thick skin.

10:54.890 --> 10:56.690
And a dancer's body.

10:58.218 --> 11:00.810
I think about Ed too much.

11:00.812 --> 11:02.992
He's got to see the humor
in the situation, right?

11:02.994 --> 11:04.570
- Mm.
- I mean, they're gonna have to

11:04.572 --> 11:07.600
chase this guy down on his walker.

11:07.602 --> 11:11.896
They might have to shoot out
one of his tennis balls.

11:11.898 --> 11:14.750
- Maybe we should start a podcast.
- Yeah.

11:15.786 --> 11:17.360
Morning, Ed.

11:19.322 --> 11:21.406
Morning there, Ed.

11:21.408 --> 11:24.217
I can't hear you because I'm old.

11:24.219 --> 11:27.724
Hardy-har-har-har.

11:27.726 --> 11:30.274
Ed, none of that stuff was personal.

11:30.276 --> 11:31.791
We weren't talking about you.

11:31.793 --> 11:35.228
I get it. Jokes are jokes,
and old men are funny.

11:35.230 --> 11:37.564
Well, not as funny as old ladies.

11:38.758 --> 11:40.744
Rapping old ladies are really funny.

11:40.746 --> 11:42.569
Yeah, yeah. Hey, give me a beat.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.846
Oh, yeah, okay.

11:44.848 --> 11:47.390
♪ My name is Gladys
and I'm here to say ♪

11:47.392 --> 11:50.852
♪ I'm the rapping-est
grandma in the U.S.A. ♪

11:50.854 --> 11:52.937
I'm married to your grandmother.

11:52.939 --> 11:54.647
I'm sure she'd find

11:54.649 --> 11:57.334
your insulting little ditty hilarious.

11:59.487 --> 12:01.746
His name is Ed, and I'm sad to say

12:01.748 --> 12:03.816
he's really pissed at us today.

12:10.457 --> 12:12.820
Okay, one game. That's ten frames.

12:12.822 --> 12:14.667
Winner joins Team Baxter.

12:14.669 --> 12:17.512
Loser is gonna be Ryan.

12:17.514 --> 12:20.673
So, you guys have bowling shoes?

12:20.675 --> 12:22.675
Thanks, but I, uh,
brought my curling flats.

12:22.677 --> 12:24.760
- Hmm.
- Teflon sole,

12:24.762 --> 12:26.762
detachable grip slider, Velcro laces.

12:26.764 --> 12:30.099
So, uh, yeah, I think I'm good.

12:30.101 --> 12:31.559
All right. Wipe the floor with him.

12:31.561 --> 12:32.810
You got it.

12:32.812 --> 12:35.062
I feel very confident in my ability.

12:35.064 --> 12:38.208
Although, the lanes seem a
lot longer than I expected.

12:39.491 --> 12:41.222
Kind of an odd thing to say

12:41.224 --> 12:42.704
for somebody who's a great bowler.

12:42.706 --> 12:46.157
Actually, an odd thing
to say for any bowler.

12:46.159 --> 12:48.951
Oh, no, no, no. I've bowled a ton.

12:48.953 --> 12:51.972
This is just my first time in
a non-virtual bowling alley.

12:55.167 --> 12:58.608
So, you've only played bowling online?

12:58.610 --> 13:00.004
You've never played real
bowling? I mean, I...

13:00.006 --> 13:01.523
- Mm-hmm.
- I play Madden football.

13:01.525 --> 13:03.928
Doesn't mean I could quarterback
for the New York Jets.

13:05.020 --> 13:07.643
Actually, I probably
could quarterback for...

13:07.645 --> 13:10.561
Fighter pilots learn to
fly on flight simulators.

13:10.563 --> 13:11.950
It's the same thing.

13:12.977 --> 13:15.686
Holy... ball!

13:15.688 --> 13:17.939
Why is it so heavy?

13:17.941 --> 13:20.116
Listen, Ryan, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

13:20.118 --> 13:22.715
but I'm relying on you.

13:22.717 --> 13:24.698
All right, you want me to go first?

13:24.700 --> 13:26.956
Show everybody how it's done?

13:26.958 --> 13:30.034
Yeah, you go first. I'm not ready.

13:30.036 --> 13:33.287
They're all heavy?

13:33.289 --> 13:36.892
For the love of God, somebody bowl.

13:44.559 --> 13:46.926
What are you doing?

13:46.928 --> 13:49.387
I don't know. The environment's off.

13:49.389 --> 13:51.239
I mean, can they make it colder in here?

13:52.517 --> 13:53.808
It's physics.

13:53.810 --> 13:56.977
I just need to pivot far enough back

13:56.979 --> 13:59.355
so that gravity is...

13:59.357 --> 14:01.440
I've never been happier
seeing you in my life.

14:01.442 --> 14:03.118
Please show these guys how to bowl.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.705
Restore my faith in humanity.

14:04.707 --> 14:06.829
No, I think I'm just
gonna watch tonight.

14:06.831 --> 14:08.871
You definitely don't want to watch this.

14:11.286 --> 14:13.411
I don't really feel
like bowling right now.

14:13.413 --> 14:14.796
What's the matter?

14:14.798 --> 14:17.557
I heard from the teachers union.

14:17.559 --> 14:20.626
Um, didn't get the endorsement.

14:20.628 --> 14:23.170
Damn it. Damn it.

14:23.172 --> 14:25.357
Well, uh, you know,
it's-it's not a big deal.

14:25.359 --> 14:27.633
- Yeah, it is.
- Um...

14:27.635 --> 14:30.144
Campaign's over, honey.

14:30.146 --> 14:32.555
I-I'll see you at home.

14:32.557 --> 14:34.309
Honey, listen, listen. Wait
a minute. Wait a minute.

14:34.311 --> 14:37.226
- Wait a minute.
- I hit a pin!

14:37.228 --> 14:40.372
That's good. Except
it's in the wrong lane.

14:47.706 --> 14:49.780
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

14:49.782 --> 14:51.160
How you doing?

14:51.162 --> 14:52.893
Fine. Fine. I am, uh...

14:52.895 --> 14:55.086
I'm just writing my concession speech,

14:55.088 --> 14:59.488
but autocorrect keeps changing
everything into "duck".

14:59.490 --> 15:01.904
You know, I thought I was
gonna get the sad Vanessa.

15:01.906 --> 15:03.336
I got the mad Vanessa.

15:03.338 --> 15:06.014
Look, I-I just can't believe
they picked Theresa Osgood.

15:06.016 --> 15:08.725
I mean, she stole my ideas.
She wasn't even talking

15:08.727 --> 15:10.718
- about education until I came along.
- Right.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.231
- You have every reason to be mad at Theresa.
- No. You know what?

15:13.233 --> 15:15.077
No. No, I'm not mad at her.

15:15.079 --> 15:17.211
I am... I am mad at myself.

15:17.213 --> 15:20.102
Look, I-I didn't get
into this thing to win.

15:20.104 --> 15:22.396
It-it was supposed to be about my ideas,

15:22.398 --> 15:25.208
and now suddenly I turned into you.

15:26.235 --> 15:28.244
Let's try to remember

15:28.246 --> 15:29.921
we're mad at Theresa.

15:30.948 --> 15:33.491
Look, I accomplished my goal.

15:33.493 --> 15:36.619
Education is being talked
about by the front-runner.

15:36.621 --> 15:39.213
Why isn't that enough?

15:39.215 --> 15:42.458
Because we all want to
win. It's in our nature.

15:42.460 --> 15:45.544
You know, I-I ran three yellow lights

15:45.546 --> 15:48.690
and cut through a gas station
to see if I could beat you home.

15:50.690 --> 15:52.438
You know what? It's-it's just amazing

15:52.440 --> 15:54.345
how easy it is to be seduced by winning,

15:54.347 --> 15:57.815
and you-you lose sight of
what's really important.

15:57.817 --> 15:59.809
You know what? I...

15:59.811 --> 16:03.020
I'm gonna call Theresa Osgood
and offer her my support.

16:03.022 --> 16:04.480
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:04.482 --> 16:06.791
Yeah, I mean, I support the teachers,

16:06.793 --> 16:09.074
and-and they support her.

16:09.076 --> 16:11.028
Yeah, just 'cause you're
out of the race doesn't mean

16:11.030 --> 16:12.327
- your ideas have to be.
- Yeah.

16:12.329 --> 16:14.198
I mean, I'm doing the right thing.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.534
So why don't I feel better?

16:16.536 --> 16:18.419
Honey, honey.

16:18.421 --> 16:20.287
If it helps, I'm proud of you.

16:20.289 --> 16:22.932
You're doing something I would never do.

16:24.919 --> 16:26.469
Oh, God.

16:26.471 --> 16:28.546
It's a lot of work to be good.

16:28.548 --> 16:32.216
Why so easy being bad?

16:32.218 --> 16:34.969
That's probably a good
question for the reverend.

16:34.971 --> 16:37.179
Mm.

16:37.181 --> 16:39.974
He's a bad person.

16:43.812 --> 16:46.127
We're sorry if we offended
you the other day.

16:46.129 --> 16:48.694
You know, we didn't think that
making fun of some old convict

16:48.696 --> 16:49.900
would hurt your feelings.

16:49.902 --> 16:52.751
Oh, really? You didn't think
mocking an older gentleman

16:52.753 --> 16:54.872
would ruffle my feathers, huh?

16:54.874 --> 16:57.742
No, because we don't
think of you as old.

16:57.744 --> 17:00.619
Or a lot.

17:00.621 --> 17:02.847
I personally think of you
an appropriate amount.

17:04.685 --> 17:06.968
Well, the truth of
the matter is I am old,

17:06.970 --> 17:08.711
and it's no picnic.

17:08.713 --> 17:11.297
We're the last group that
it's safe to make fun of.

17:11.299 --> 17:13.641
Y-You have no idea how hard it is

17:13.643 --> 17:15.259
to be old in America, do you?

17:15.261 --> 17:16.778
You have my condolences.

17:18.513 --> 17:21.523
- Anyway, uh, we did a little research.
- Mm-hmm.

17:21.526 --> 17:25.500
Turns out Bill Connelly...
uh, th-that's the convict...

17:25.502 --> 17:27.605
turns out he's a pretty impressive guy.

17:27.607 --> 17:29.099
Yeah, this is his third escape.

17:29.101 --> 17:31.325
His first one was when he was 72.

17:31.327 --> 17:33.087
He didn't even start a life of crime

17:33.089 --> 17:35.797
until he was 65.

17:35.799 --> 17:39.366
What we're trying to say is that
you can be a badass at any age.

17:39.368 --> 17:41.035
I know he's a criminal,

17:41.037 --> 17:43.537
but I can't help but admire the guy.

17:43.539 --> 17:44.997
I wish him well.

17:44.999 --> 17:47.208
And actually, his crimes
aren't all that bad.

17:47.210 --> 17:49.352
He's more of a... a Robin Hood type.

17:49.354 --> 17:50.961
Uh-huh, meaning what? What, what?

17:50.963 --> 17:53.773
Um, he only stole from the very rich.

17:56.853 --> 17:58.478
Pardon me?

17:58.480 --> 18:00.521
It turns out he didn't
even need the money.

18:00.523 --> 18:02.759
- He was just doing it for fun.
- Yeah.

18:02.761 --> 18:05.428
It's fun to steal from the rich?

18:06.773 --> 18:08.087
Well, in that case,

18:08.089 --> 18:09.855
I hope the old geezer breaks a hip,

18:09.857 --> 18:12.542
chokes on a butterscotch
and goes straight to hell.

18:15.613 --> 18:17.696
Hey, hey.

18:17.698 --> 18:19.281
Saw your team warming up.

18:19.283 --> 18:21.129
Listen, you don't need
to go to church tomorrow,

18:21.131 --> 18:24.504
'cause tonight, my team's
gonna bowl the sin out of you.

18:24.506 --> 18:26.882
You can use substitutes for curse words,

18:26.884 --> 18:29.480
but I know what you mean,
and bless your little heart.

18:29.482 --> 18:31.376
Uh, Reverend.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.596
Hey, uh, don't split,

18:33.598 --> 18:36.173
because I am not going to spare you.

18:37.685 --> 18:38.918
Those are pretty good puns, actually.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.219
You know, you must be feeling better

18:40.221 --> 18:42.054
or you finished that wine I gave you.

18:42.056 --> 18:44.473
No, no, I called Theresa Osgood,

18:44.475 --> 18:46.826
and she admitted that
she stole my ideas.

18:46.828 --> 18:48.978
Well, bless her little heart.

18:48.980 --> 18:50.716
Yeah. When I talked to her,

18:50.718 --> 18:52.565
she said that since I know them better,

18:52.567 --> 18:53.995
you know, because they're mine,

18:53.997 --> 18:56.282
uh, that if she wins,

18:56.284 --> 18:59.363
- uh, she will make me her education liaison.
- All right.

18:59.365 --> 19:00.739
- So, just... Let's be clear here.
- Yeah.

19:00.741 --> 19:01.858
She stole your ideas,

19:01.860 --> 19:03.709
but we still get to keep the cookies.

19:03.711 --> 19:05.545
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

19:05.547 --> 19:08.014
Now I'm ready for some fun.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.509
Well, I hope you don't mean bowling,

19:10.511 --> 19:12.695
'cause Team Baxter
already has four players.

19:14.304 --> 19:17.143
"Kristin, Jen, Ryan, Vanessa".

19:17.145 --> 19:18.318
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.639
There's no Mike Baxter on Team Baxter?

19:20.641 --> 19:22.052
Well, you know, this
bowling used to be fun,

19:22.054 --> 19:23.613
and I think it should be fun again.

19:23.615 --> 19:26.307
- Huh?
- Mike.

19:26.309 --> 19:28.442
Oh.

19:28.444 --> 19:30.394
Wow.

19:30.396 --> 19:32.771
Hey. Ryan, wow. Love your shoes.

19:32.773 --> 19:34.457
Oh, thanks. They're curling flats.

19:36.014 --> 19:39.987
Yeah, I brought the broom, too,
but probably not gonna use it.

19:39.989 --> 19:41.589
Hey, Mr. B?

19:41.591 --> 19:43.324
Can I have another quarter?

19:43.326 --> 19:45.075
All right.

19:45.077 --> 19:47.136
Why don't you take the whole roll.

19:55.379 --> 19:57.321
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man,

19:57.323 --> 19:59.465
talking about winners and losers...

19:59.467 --> 20:02.009
not to be confused with right and wrong.

20:02.011 --> 20:04.967
Now, would it be nice
if doing the right thing

20:04.969 --> 20:07.315
and winning was always...
went hand in hand?

20:07.317 --> 20:09.358
It would also be nice if
ice cream got you ripped.

20:11.523 --> 20:13.513
But I know you're winners.
You know how I know?

20:13.515 --> 20:15.856
Because you're listening to me.

20:15.858 --> 20:18.389
Sometimes, we can spot
a winner pretty quickly,

20:18.391 --> 20:20.694
like in 40 seconds
if it's Conor McGregor

20:20.696 --> 20:23.072
coming at you across The Octagon.

20:23.074 --> 20:25.046
Look out, Cowboy.

20:25.048 --> 20:26.529
Or sometimes,

20:26.531 --> 20:28.410
we might need overtime to crown a champ.

20:28.412 --> 20:30.746
And sometimes, we'll
never find out who won.

20:30.748 --> 20:34.124
Welcome to Iowa caucus.

20:34.126 --> 20:36.844
"Uh, I forgot how to count".

20:38.473 --> 20:41.507
You know, they say history
is written by the winners,

20:41.509 --> 20:44.068
but it's really written by historians.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.842
And before we call them winners,

20:45.844 --> 20:48.889
one of them should have to
go out and get a girlfriend.

20:48.891 --> 20:50.516
Speaking of history,

20:50.518 --> 20:52.410
Roman philosopher Seneca once said,

20:52.412 --> 20:54.606
"Admire those who attempt great things

20:54.608 --> 20:55.729
even though they fail".

20:55.731 --> 20:57.606
Another philosopher,

20:57.608 --> 21:00.985
Green Bay Packer Vince Lombardi,
said, "Show me a good loser,

21:00.987 --> 21:03.904
and I'll show you a loser".

21:05.050 --> 21:07.241
Hmm. Seneca won more debates,

21:07.243 --> 21:09.040
but Lombardi won more championships.

21:09.042 --> 21:10.648
Now, sometimes, as Americans,

21:10.650 --> 21:12.162
our obsession with winning and losing

21:12.164 --> 21:14.715
can make us lose sight
of what's right and wrong.

21:14.717 --> 21:17.185
I'm talking to you, Houston Astros.

21:25.678 --> 21:27.534
As Marcus Aurelius said,

21:27.536 --> 21:30.231
"If it's not right, don't do it.

21:30.233 --> 21:32.894
If it's not true, don't say it".

21:32.896 --> 21:35.002
And that, my friends, is the truth.

21:35.004 --> 21:37.397
Just saying. Baxter out.

21:40.484 --> 21:43.477
