WEBVTT

00:06.365 --> 00:10.354
Oh no don't get up, I'm
just right here anyway.

00:11.074 --> 00:12.942
I'll help you Mrs. Forman.

00:13.012 --> 00:15.478
Oh no, don't you
worry Samantha.

00:15.499 --> 00:19.726
It's just a little unbalanced because our
appropriate sized clothes are on one side

00:19.761 --> 00:22.884
and your little teeny-tiny
strippers clothes are on the other.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.228
I'm sorry,

00:27.697 --> 00:29.893
I'm sorry I'm so grumpy.

00:30.445 --> 00:34.551
I got a manicure yesterday and
Red still hasn't said a darn word.

00:35.009 --> 00:36.759
You know, if you really
want him to notice you,

00:36.787 --> 00:39.621
you should get drunk and do
some doughnuts on his lawn.

00:41.042 --> 00:43.478
Mrs. Forman, you
should change your hair.

00:43.498 --> 00:45.964
When I went blond,
Eric went nuts.

00:46.238 --> 00:48.268
And then Fez went nuts

00:49.446 --> 00:52.213
and then I started
wearing a lot of hats.

00:52.997 --> 00:56.302
No, I can't change
my hair. Red loves it.

00:56.328 --> 00:57.833
It's my trademark.

00:59.565 --> 01:03.250
It'd be like telling
Fonzie not to say "hey".

01:05.838 --> 01:09.590
Mrs. Forman, a great way to get a man's
attention is to show him how smart you are.

01:09.628 --> 01:12.091
But a faster way is to
take your clothes off.

01:13.726 --> 01:15.881
I can help you
work on some moves.

01:15.906 --> 01:18.172
Oooooh nooo, I don't
need to see that.

01:18.708 --> 01:20.933
It'll be like
watching my Mom strip.

01:21.596 --> 01:24.581
Which unfortunately I saw at
"Take your son to work day".

01:25.378 --> 01:27.532
No you know what,
I'll just uhm

01:27.568 --> 01:30.752
I'll just spray on some of
my special occasion perfume.

01:30.777 --> 01:35.422
It's very expensive but you put a little
water in there, you can really make it last.

01:37.557 --> 01:40.152
Hey Sam. Can I
ask you something ?

01:40.566 --> 01:43.620
Uhm I wanted to send
Eric some..you know,

01:43.716 --> 01:45.623
like sexy pictures.

01:45.666 --> 01:48.102
Sure, I have some
eight by tens in my car.

01:48.997 --> 01:50.062
Of me.

01:52.257 --> 01:53.913
Anyway uhm,

01:55.385 --> 01:56.892
would you mind taking them ?

01:56.927 --> 02:00.851
I'd love too ! I have a great pair
of thigh high boots you can use.

02:00.886 --> 02:02.533
Oh I don't think
we're the same size.

02:02.568 --> 02:05.703
Oh you're not gonna wear them
silly. You're gonna lick 'm !

02:12.977 --> 02:14.301
Oh hi Jackie.

02:16.235 --> 02:17.700
Hang in there baby.

02:19.215 --> 02:21.031
And the kid is hanging.

02:22.795 --> 02:23.670
Funny.

02:25.297 --> 02:27.991
So, what the hell are you
doing in my apartment ?

02:28.545 --> 02:31.681
Oh well, since Michael moved to
Chicago, he let me have his room.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.100
We're gonna be roommates !

02:33.146 --> 02:34.202
Roommates ?!

02:34.327 --> 02:35.760
Hot diggity !

02:38.436 --> 02:41.181
Think of the whacky
adventures we will have.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.841
Fez, that is the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

03:46.055 --> 03:47.452
Catchy tune though.

03:50.127 --> 03:53.910

04:26.796 --> 04:28.542
Okay, Jackie,
I'm off to work.

04:28.577 --> 04:31.953
Wait, but we're roomies ! What am I
supposed to do while you are gone ?

04:32.055 --> 04:32.990
Listen,

04:33.028 --> 04:35.382
when I get home, it's you and
me, we'll do whatever you want.

04:35.848 --> 04:38.342
OH ! The Wizard of
Oz is on TV tonight !

04:38.376 --> 04:40.972
We can watch it and
make fun of Kansas !

04:41.618 --> 04:44.562
It's a date ! I love
these little munchkins.

04:45.505 --> 04:47.941
I wish I could represent
a lollypop-guild.

04:49.196 --> 04:50.912
Boy, there'd be
some changes !

04:54.156 --> 04:57.650
I can't believe I let you
take naked pictures of me

04:58.556 --> 05:02.170
I don't really get that one with
the GI-Joe between your boobs ?

05:03.556 --> 05:06.423
But hey, you know
Eric better than me !

05:08.177 --> 05:11.763
Hi sweetie. Whoo, a letter for
Eric. Want me to mail it for ya ?

05:11.836 --> 05:13.553
No no no, I got it.

05:13.598 --> 05:15.073
But I love going
to the postoffice !

05:15.108 --> 05:18.220
I have these funny things I ay
when a line is moving slow, like:

05:18.258 --> 05:20.491
Hey, were did I
park my dinosaur ?

05:22.008 --> 05:23.021
Uhm

05:23.516 --> 05:26.703
okay. But you know it's illegal
to tamper with mail right ?

05:26.736 --> 05:29.561
Yeah but is not illegal to
complain about a slow moving line !

05:29.606 --> 05:32.663
Hey can we speed it up, my
pet snail is getting away !

05:33.196 --> 05:34.792
That's good stuff Dad.

05:49.846 --> 05:51.571
Have a browny Red

05:55.836 --> 05:58.722
Something smells terrific !

05:58.767 --> 06:00.510
You noticed !

06:00.566 --> 06:01.952
Sure did !

06:02.125 --> 06:04.763
You put peanutbutter
in the brownies !

06:10.007 --> 06:10.912
Samantha !

06:11.777 --> 06:14.671
Okay, stripping is all
about the art of seduction.

06:14.697 --> 06:19.302
So the first thing you wanna do is set
the mood. Like with music, or candles.

06:19.335 --> 06:23.342
Oh..oh. All I have are those trick
candles, the ones you can't blow out.

06:24.288 --> 06:26.461
They make Red furious,
it's very funny !

06:28.235 --> 06:33.251
I always start my routine
by slowly removing my gloves.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.773
I have gloves !

06:41.277 --> 06:43.302
Feel sexy already !

06:44.305 --> 06:45.591
You know what ?

06:45.925 --> 06:47.610
Let's skip ahead.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.740
Look your husband in the eye

06:50.786 --> 06:54.481
and go step,
dip, hair, flip.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.791
You try it !

06:57.786 --> 06:58.571
Okay.

06:59.595 --> 07:03.382
Step, dip, hair, flip.

07:04.947 --> 07:06.301
That's great.

07:06.345 --> 07:10.641
For our next lesson I'll teach you how to
pick up money using everything but your hands.

07:16.997 --> 07:18.183
Hey Kitty !

07:18.855 --> 07:21.521
Taking Donna's letter for
Eric over the postoffice.

07:21.556 --> 07:22.873
Got anything to eat...

07:23.076 --> 07:24.220
I mean mail.

07:24.965 --> 07:28.562
Oh you know what ? Why don't you leave
this with me, I have to add some things.

07:28.608 --> 07:32.370
Like, todays Marmaduke,
it's a stitch !

07:34.097 --> 07:35.011
Okay...

07:37.717 --> 07:39.323
Have a brownie Bob.

07:39.985 --> 07:41.953
That's what I
was waiting for !

07:46.708 --> 07:50.320
Oh Marmaduke, when
will you ever learn ?

07:59.475 --> 08:00.401
Donna... ?

08:04.825 --> 08:06.371
Oh my !

08:11.227 --> 08:12.750
GI Joe ?!

08:17.235 --> 08:19.841
Mrs. Forman, the washer
is acting up again !

08:19.885 --> 08:21.461
Umh, okay okay !

08:21.817 --> 08:22.890
Coming !

08:29.168 --> 08:31.332
Where are those
damn car keys ?

08:43.986 --> 08:45.811
Good lord !

08:47.148 --> 08:49.541
Steven, you could
have fixed that !

09:00.028 --> 09:01.680
Well, I'm off to work.

09:02.097 --> 09:04.320
So if you need me,
I'll be at the Hub.

09:15.038 --> 09:16.020
Oh no !

09:17.878 --> 09:19.143
Oh nooo !

09:20.716 --> 09:22.701
Oh please noooooo !

09:24.188 --> 09:27.961
All right, Kitty, Kitty, don't
panic. You know what to do.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.063
Holy crap, it's Caroline !

09:43.565 --> 09:44.762
Who is Caroline ?

09:45.306 --> 09:48.771
She went out with Fez. But he broke
up with her, because she's crazy.

09:49.645 --> 09:52.570
Which is ironic, 'cause that's probably why
she went out with him in the first place.

09:53.567 --> 09:55.872
Guys, I can't let
her see me. Hide me !

09:57.436 --> 09:59.613
Where should we
hide you Fez ?!

10:01.168 --> 10:02.212
Fez ?!

10:02.735 --> 10:04.641
Well played, you
son of a bitch.

10:06.055 --> 10:07.911
- Hi !
- Hi !

10:08.758 --> 10:11.002
Caroline, you look good.

10:11.957 --> 10:14.453
Not quite so... nuts.

10:15.937 --> 10:19.432
Yeah, I'm doing much better
thanks to my therapist.

10:19.468 --> 10:24.343
And my meds. And some good
old-fashioned bzzzzz electricity !

10:24.828 --> 10:27.933
But there is one thing
about me that hasn't changed.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.203
Is it that you can still spin
your head all the way around ?

10:31.805 --> 10:32.662
NO !

10:35.795 --> 10:39.572
It's that I still have a
thirst for hot chocolate...

10:39.638 --> 10:40.822
you know what I mean.

10:42.477 --> 10:45.092
I do. I used to
have a thirst for...

10:46.137 --> 10:48.270
crazy medicated white women.

10:49.617 --> 10:52.273
So uhm, maybe I could
come over tonight ?

10:52.316 --> 10:55.493
I mean, if there are no other women in
your life cause I couldn't handle that.

10:55.542 --> 10:58.638
No, the only other women in
Fez's life are in his head.

10:59.788 --> 11:01.534
But you must
know about that ?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.858
You've got a cast of
thousands up there.

11:06.068 --> 11:07.520
Shut up !

11:14.126 --> 11:17.932
So, you just invited me over for some
brownies in the middle of the day ?

11:19.258 --> 11:20.093
Yes...

11:22.847 --> 11:27.041
Oh, and I opened your mail and I saw your
nudy pictures. Would you like some milk ?

11:27.568 --> 11:28.373
What ?!?!

11:30.306 --> 11:31.993
Oh my God !

11:33.207 --> 11:36.372
Your father gave me the letter,
I just wanted to add some things.

11:36.407 --> 11:38.430
Well, did you
mail the pictures ?

11:38.476 --> 11:40.523
No, but I will as
soon as I find them !

11:40.566 --> 11:41.440
Whaaaaatt ?!?!?!?!?!

11:42.586 --> 11:45.550
Well don't worry I'm
sure nobody else saw them.

11:46.316 --> 11:49.072
Hey Kitty, have you seen
the car keys ? Oh, Donna

11:54.248 --> 11:56.670
Oh my God, you too ?!

11:57.346 --> 11:59.921
I was looking for
the damn car keys !

12:01.036 --> 12:03.930
This drawer is
for car keys and

12:04.385 --> 12:06.313
and magnets, that's it.

12:07.175 --> 12:09.562
Well, where are they now ?

12:13.605 --> 12:14.482
Whoooow !

12:15.698 --> 12:17.211
Holy hell !

12:18.507 --> 12:20.110
I know man.

12:20.546 --> 12:22.063
Where's Marmaduke ?!

12:28.227 --> 12:28.933
Hey.

12:29.976 --> 12:30.973
Heyyy Donna

12:38.356 --> 12:39.640
What's so funny ?

12:42.375 --> 12:44.262
Guess I'm just a happy guy.

12:46.048 --> 12:49.291
Hey, it's the naked
lady from the newspaper !

12:50.518 --> 12:52.420
Okay, here it comes.

12:52.798 --> 12:54.843
Err, I have just
one question for you.

12:54.897 --> 12:57.532
Does my wife know you
were licking her boots ?

12:58.398 --> 13:01.571
Donna, I'm writing a letter to the
newspaper. About your photo-essay.

13:01.608 --> 13:04.172
Here is what I have
so far: Yeeesss !

13:05.615 --> 13:08.181
Okay, just tell me
where the pictures are.

13:08.225 --> 13:11.542
Hey not to worry. I hid
'm in a Barry White album.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.863
Great. Where's that ?!

13:15.048 --> 13:18.010
You'll have to ask the
guy who bought it. Duhh !

13:19.678 --> 13:21.602
Knock, knock, who's there ?

13:23.358 --> 13:24.282
Fez !

13:24.727 --> 13:26.223
And Barry White.

13:27.688 --> 13:30.892
Hey Fez. It is almost
Wizard of Oz time.

13:30.935 --> 13:34.930
And I did my hair like Dorothy, but
since there are no foreigners in Oz,

13:34.958 --> 13:36.843
I created a new
charater for you.

13:37.065 --> 13:38.073
The Butler.

13:39.756 --> 13:42.342
Oh. Bad news racist Dorothy.

13:43.446 --> 13:46.752
Something has come up. Someone
unexpected doiiing iiit.

13:47.857 --> 13:49.261
You remember Caroline ?

13:49.286 --> 13:52.631
What with the crazy nut-job who said
she was gonna scratch my eyes out ?

13:52.657 --> 13:54.632
Yes. Sweet girl.

13:56.678 --> 13:59.560
Look she is coming over tonight and
she gets very jealous of other women.

13:59.628 --> 14:01.320
So, you're gonna
have to leave.

14:01.355 --> 14:03.102
Where am I supposed to go ?!

14:03.147 --> 14:06.001
I don't know, just click your heels
three times and get the hell out.

14:07.257 --> 14:09.290
Fez, I am not gonna
leave my own apartment !

14:09.325 --> 14:11.772
Okay, you know you're right.
I'm being unreasonable.

14:11.817 --> 14:14.212
Just go into your room and
don't come out untill morning.

14:14.727 --> 14:16.993
And eat quiet foods only.

14:17.026 --> 14:20.010
Yoghurt, marshmellows,
maybe cotton candy.

14:20.055 --> 14:22.270
But save me some,
because I just love it.

14:23.097 --> 14:26.260
I can't believe this, I mean we made
a plan to watch the Wizard of Oz.

14:26.297 --> 14:29.363
Yes and then I was offered sex,
so ding-dong the plan is dead !

14:37.448 --> 14:40.623
Oh crap, did we
blow a fuse again ?!

14:41.678 --> 14:43.951
Kitty ? What are you doing ?

14:44.388 --> 14:47.150
Making your day sailor !

14:52.128 --> 14:53.621
And step,

14:55.108 --> 14:55.972
dip,

14:56.937 --> 14:58.671
hair flip.

14:58.727 --> 15:02.190
Kitty watch the candles ! Oh
my God your hair is on fire !

15:02.326 --> 15:03.242
What ?!

15:05.086 --> 15:06.422
Am I out ?

15:11.377 --> 15:13.912
Wow. This is really nice.

15:13.958 --> 15:18.081
Oh it's been so long since
I've sat and talked to a man and

15:18.117 --> 15:20.653
been able to move
my own arms freely.

15:27.705 --> 15:31.400
Whose mascara is that ?! Fez,
is there another woman here ?!

15:31.446 --> 15:34.801
What ? No, no !
It's a... it's mine.

15:35.105 --> 15:38.322
Yeah, lashes like this
don't come naturally baby.

15:41.015 --> 15:45.622
Uhm, why don't you go to the kitchen
and uhm open us a bottle of wine ?

15:45.647 --> 15:49.941
Well my doctor says I'm not supposed to drink
while I take my meds. But what he doesn't know is,

15:49.987 --> 15:52.053
I didn't take my meds !

15:55.138 --> 15:56.741
What are you doing ?!

15:56.768 --> 15:58.493
I have to go to
the bathroom !

15:58.516 --> 16:01.103
Well you should have thought of that
before I locked you in your room !

16:01.517 --> 16:03.081
Fez, where is
the corkscrew ?

16:03.108 --> 16:05.621
Uhm, it's under
the sink my dear !

16:05.798 --> 16:09.263
You are supposed to stay in your
room ! I even gave you quiet foods !

16:10.027 --> 16:14.203
Yeah ok, the yoghurt you gave me expired two
months ago and it's smells like vomit and peach.

16:14.487 --> 16:16.070
Honey ?

16:16.896 --> 16:18.163
Yes baby ?

16:18.208 --> 16:19.710
I can't find...

16:20.335 --> 16:22.042
where did you
get that yoghurt ?

16:22.795 --> 16:24.100
Oh uhhh,

16:24.586 --> 16:27.581
I keep yoghurt all
over my apartment.

16:28.886 --> 16:30.102
I love it.

16:31.088 --> 16:31.812
See.

16:43.075 --> 16:44.152
Yummmm.

16:46.265 --> 16:47.971
That's the stuff.

16:48.668 --> 16:52.403
So uhm, did you find
that corkscrew honey-pie.

16:52.448 --> 16:53.693
Not yet

17:00.098 --> 17:01.631
Fez, I'm not like you.

17:01.677 --> 17:04.371
I don't know how to
entertain myself in the dark.

17:05.846 --> 17:07.102
Oh here it is !

17:07.137 --> 17:08.910
I want to watch
the Wizard of Oz !

17:08.935 --> 17:10.012
Okay,

17:10.047 --> 17:13.383
Okay, a scarecrow gets a brain, a lion gets
some courage and the robot gets a heart.

17:21.617 --> 17:22.923
You know,

17:23.047 --> 17:27.752
when I was in the kitchen, I wanted
to carve our initials into my arm.

17:30.047 --> 17:33.032
But that's what the old
crazy me would have done.

17:33.066 --> 17:36.273
So I carved them into
your counter top instead.

17:37.816 --> 17:40.061
Well...look who's
all better...

17:43.196 --> 17:44.272
Please Leo,

17:44.718 --> 17:48.383
you have to remember who
you sold that record to.

17:49.897 --> 17:50.631
Think.

17:51.617 --> 17:53.821
Who have you seen today ?

17:56.005 --> 17:59.463
Well I remember a guy with
scraggly hair and a beard.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.360
And he was
brushing his teeth.

18:03.787 --> 18:05.683
That was you in a mirror.

18:06.685 --> 18:10.240
And then there's this
other guy, with big lips

18:10.286 --> 18:13.263
and another guy
with long hair

18:13.727 --> 18:16.722
and another guy with a
thumbtack in his head.

18:17.748 --> 18:20.271
That would be the
Aerosmith poster.

18:23.415 --> 18:26.420
You know, I have been
trapped in this vortex before.

18:28.495 --> 18:30.461
There is a way we
can jog his memory.

18:34.835 --> 18:37.013
It was Fez man !

18:45.058 --> 18:46.371
Okay Red.

18:49.257 --> 18:51.480
You're not gonna be happy.

18:52.765 --> 18:57.651
My stylist said there wasn't enough left
up there to salvage my old hairdo. So,

18:57.725 --> 18:59.320
I'm sorry, but.

19:04.587 --> 19:05.663
Wooooooww !

19:08.085 --> 19:09.803
Look at you !

19:10.708 --> 19:12.240
Do you like it ?

19:12.278 --> 19:13.653
Hubba hubba !

19:16.386 --> 19:17.560
Really ?

19:18.716 --> 19:24.153
I have been trying so hard to get you to notice
me and all I had to do was set my hair on fire.

19:25.268 --> 19:29.032
How do you like to go upstairs
and let me see it in the dark ?

19:30.826 --> 19:33.561
Or...we could leave
the lights on...

19:40.178 --> 19:44.801
Well that was a nice appetizer, but I believe
the main course will be served in the bedroom...

19:45.405 --> 19:47.613
Yes. I am going
to brush my teeth.

19:48.118 --> 19:49.201
Yoghurt-breath.

19:50.346 --> 19:53.143
Why don't you go in and
put on some Barry White.

19:57.997 --> 20:00.012
Where are they,
you pervert ?!

20:00.036 --> 20:01.103
Look Donna, you
have to leave !

20:01.137 --> 20:03.080
I'm not going anywhere
without my pictures !

20:03.128 --> 20:04.743
Shhhh ! What pictures ?

20:06.155 --> 20:10.470
The naked ones of me, the ones in
the Barry White record you bought.

20:11.536 --> 20:12.803
Ahhh crap !

20:16.985 --> 20:20.753
What the hell are these ?
And what is she doing here ?!

20:20.798 --> 20:22.851
Will you give me those ?!

20:22.877 --> 20:24.922
Fez, I thought you
said you lived alone !

20:24.948 --> 20:28.532
I do ! She's just visiting I swear !
There is no-one else that lives here.

20:29.365 --> 20:34.301
Screw this, you know I'm not gonna sit
locked up in my room with stale marshmellows.

20:34.326 --> 20:35.962
I live here too !

20:37.058 --> 20:39.330
Oh that's incredibly
bad timing.

20:40.365 --> 20:41.880
Two women ?!

20:41.918 --> 20:45.020
Okay. Caroline, I have
to be honest with you.

20:45.325 --> 20:47.403
Juanita and Mary-Jose
are my maids.

20:50.215 --> 20:53.981
Well then. They can clean
up all of your blood !

21:05.495 --> 21:08.200
Okay, here's how
you make fruit salad.

21:08.986 --> 21:11.412
First, let me
squeeze those melons.

21:11.837 --> 21:14.193
Oh, aren't they
nice and firm ?

21:15.268 --> 21:16.070
Yes..

21:16.737 --> 21:18.241
Now grab my banana !

21:20.435 --> 21:22.873
Oh, it's huge !

21:23.836 --> 21:27.273
All right you perverts,
stop it right now...

21:27.945 --> 21:29.772
Another fruit salad ?

21:29.995 --> 21:32.530
Why can't they
ever be having sex ?

21:33.305 --> 21:39.732
