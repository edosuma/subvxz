10:04.646 --> 10:06.420
Hey, babe.
How are things in the boondocks?

10:06.481 --> 10:07.997
God, you must be miserable.

10:08.058 --> 10:11.501
Oh, yeah, I'm surrounded
by a bunch of backwoods,

10:11.561 --> 10:13.519
lotto-scratching,
monster-truck-driving,

10:13.672 --> 10:15.338
Big-Gulp-guzzling bumpkins.

10:15.398 --> 10:17.690
I can't wait
to go back to the city.

10:17.843 --> 10:20.526
Well, it'll all be worth it when
you get your big promotion--

10:20.621 --> 10:22.954
movie executive
for a greeting card company.

10:23.147 --> 10:25.081
See? I listen.

10:29.855 --> 10:31.421
-♪ ♪
-Ah.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.341
Mm.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.212
Okay, there's nowhere else
to sleep.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.348

11:14.991 --> 11:16.991
Most people think
the capital is New York,

11:17.052 --> 11:18.367
but it's Albany.

11:18.387 --> 11:19.752

no room at the inn.

11:36.053 --> 11:37.754
That's it!

11:37.856 --> 11:39.989

11:43.686 --> 11:45.428
-Tough day?
-Aah!

11:45.488 --> 11:47.096
Would you like some tea?

11:47.157 --> 11:49.190

11:54.214 --> 11:57.106
Wine? Why, yes. Yes, I do.

11:57.167 --> 12:00.944

"quirky best friend" territory.

12:01.004 --> 12:02.612
So, we were supposed to shoot

12:02.672 --> 12:04.556

scene tomorrow,

12:04.725 --> 12:06.449

12:06.551 --> 12:08.727
a very aggressive
beaver population.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.562
(beavers grunting)

12:10.755 --> 12:14.140
So no more
big town-wide celebration.

12:14.292 --> 12:15.734
But you need that!

12:15.927 --> 12:18.311

Heartmark Christmas movie

12:18.405 --> 12:20.221
where everybody comes together,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.800
and the jaded outsider
is finally won over.

12:23.902 --> 12:26.894
Well, we don't have the time
or money or creativity

12:26.955 --> 12:29.305
to come up with something new.

12:29.324 --> 12:32.751
So unless Springfield already
has some big event tomorrow,

12:32.902 --> 12:36.254
that's already decorated
in Christmas colors...

12:51.438 --> 12:52.753

12:52.814 --> 12:54.773

just might be good enough

12:54.966 --> 12:56.349
to fold laundry to.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.501
How are you gonna explain
all the produce

12:58.561 --> 13:00.503

13:00.563 --> 13:02.263
Eh, so long
as the attractive white people

13:02.324 --> 13:05.283

smooches, nobody's complaining.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.937

I leave to pick up
my I-heart-Bibb bibs,

13:12.167 --> 13:16.202
and you turn my summer festival
into a-a-a holiday set piece!

13:16.296 --> 13:18.421
I thought we had a deal.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.376

everyone's having a great time.

the Lettice and Tomato Festival

13:25.972 --> 13:28.548
could get any better--
but Christmas!

13:28.642 --> 13:32.727
Yeah. Makes Okratoberfest
seem ridiculous in comparison.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.723
All I gotta do
is ruin this movie.

13:37.818 --> 13:39.892

Aw, no, this is the worst thing
to happen to this movie

13:56.527 --> 13:57.985
since someone wrote it.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.672
Okay, that's a wrap for today.

14:00.865 --> 14:03.824
-SKINNER (muffled): Help. Help!
-MARY (muffled): Help!
Help, help!

14:03.885 --> 14:05.510
We're trapped.

14:06.905 --> 14:09.389
(sighs)
It had to be a Christmas movie.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.354
(sighs)
Zero bars.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.006
Well, we'll just have to dig
our way out.

14:20.184 --> 14:22.843
Aah! What the hell
is this fake snow made of?

14:22.863 --> 14:24.420
I have no idea.

14:24.522 --> 14:26.513
We paid some local lunatic
to grind it for us.

14:26.575 --> 14:28.274
Well, I hope you're happy.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.610
First you ruin my festival,
and now this.

14:30.762 --> 14:32.186
People loved it!

Oh, Lenny and Carl
like everything.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.192
That's their affect.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.286
Is it getting hotter in here?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.622
It would appear
our heated verbal sparring

14:42.774 --> 14:44.457
is upping the temperature
in this confined space.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.551
Well, I guess
we should agree not to talk.

14:46.744 --> 14:48.344
-Fine.
-Fine.

14:59.182 --> 15:01.733
Um, maybe this'll cool you down.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.985
Thanks.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.818
Look, I'm sorry
I ruined your festival.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.229
No, you made it better.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.399
People seemed to actually be
showing up on purpose this year.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.643
Springfield's lucky
to have someone like you

15:20.703 --> 15:22.979

about small-town values.

15:22.997 --> 15:24.589
(yawns)

15:26.301 --> 15:27.817
Sure is hot in here.

15:27.877 --> 15:29.819
Perhaps we should huddle closer.

15:29.879 --> 15:31.137
For coolness.

15:40.631 --> 15:41.755
Good morning.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.149
How did you get out?

15:43.300 --> 15:44.943
Well, luckily,
the fake snow hardened,

15:45.136 --> 15:46.927
and I was able to dig my way out

15:46.988 --> 15:49.614
with this shoehorn
I always carry on my person.

15:49.807 --> 15:51.324
God, you're handy.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.786
One extra-tall, nonfat,
triple-vegan espresso mocha,

15:54.979 --> 15:56.788
clean white,
two-pump, half-barley water,

15:56.981 --> 15:59.606
half-macadamia milk
with room for air.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.627
-You remembered.
-Who could forget it?

16:07.133 --> 16:08.708
SURGEON FIANCE:
Mary?

16:08.860 --> 16:11.043
So this is why
you didn't answer my calls.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.712
No! It's not what it looks like!

16:12.806 --> 16:15.139
He's just the gazebo builder.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.370
You took my room from me,
movie lady.

16:21.431 --> 16:23.982
And now it's payback time.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.985
Hey, everybody! Want to see
what this Heartmark phony

16:27.153 --> 16:28.861
really thinks of you?

I let myself be whimsical
in front of you!

Wait! I didn't mean it!

And we know all about your plans
to sell the town

17:09.029 --> 17:12.179
to that big developer who wants
to turn it into condos.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.774
No, I'm not.
How would I sell the town?

17:14.868 --> 17:16.259
Yeah, all right.
Forget I said anything.

17:16.319 --> 17:17.777
I took a shot.
I whiffed it.

17:17.929 --> 17:19.019
Let's just... move on.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.538
Mary, you got to do something.

17:20.731 --> 17:23.207
Without these Big Gulp-guzzling
bumpkins as extras,

17:23.400 --> 17:25.101
we can't finish the movie.

17:25.161 --> 17:26.769
Come back, everyone!

17:26.829 --> 17:28.337
Come back.

17:30.866 --> 17:34.052
I love it
when a shoot falls apart.

17:41.177 --> 17:43.394
I was sent here
to put<i> out</i> fires.

17:45.223 --> 17:48.808
How could you say those hurtful
things about Springfield?

17:48.902 --> 17:52.386
I'm sorry, but working
on this movie's been so painful.

17:52.489 --> 17:55.648
For me, Christmas is the least
wonderful time of the year.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.300
But the song says "the most."

17:57.360 --> 17:59.285
I know what the song says!

18:01.289 --> 18:04.248
There's a reason
I hate Christmas movies.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.253
It all started one winter,

18:09.446 --> 18:11.330
when a movie production
came to town.

18:11.482 --> 18:13.925
My dad thought
it'd be fun to be an extra.

18:14.118 --> 18:16.152
They cast him
as a store employee

18:16.254 --> 18:18.412
in a scene where crazed parents
stormed in

18:18.473 --> 18:20.247
to get the hottest toy.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.915
He was trampled to death.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.917
You can still see
his last moments on Earth

18:23.978 --> 18:26.086

18:32.803 --> 18:34.612
my fiancé, my dream job

18:34.805 --> 18:35.947
and, worst of all,

18:36.098 --> 18:38.190
the respect of a small town.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.860
Then you<i> do</i> like Springfield.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.361
I've come to love this place,

18:42.455 --> 18:44.180
with its homespun ways,

18:44.198 --> 18:45.790
its earnest, hardworking folk

18:45.983 --> 18:48.534
and its wonderful
airbed-and-breakfasts.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.035
I guess what I'm saying is,

18:50.130 --> 18:52.255
I'm really gonna miss you all.

18:56.919 --> 18:58.136
Airport, please.

18:58.287 --> 18:59.378

this piece of crap after all.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.210
(laughing)

19:14.270 --> 19:16.261
You. But how?

19:16.322 --> 19:19.490
I gave a rousing speech
about how our Gulps might be big

19:19.683 --> 19:21.384
and our trucks might be monster

19:21.444 --> 19:23.903
but our hearts
are enlarged as well.

19:23.997 --> 19:27.406
And I secretly filmed you saying
nice things to my mom.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.001
And I showed the whole town.

19:30.194 --> 19:33.171
Yeah, and we saw that was
the real youse. (chuckles)

19:33.364 --> 19:34.988

19:35.049 --> 19:37.341

that small towns

19:37.493 --> 19:39.177
are the best-sized towns of all

19:39.370 --> 19:41.846

are the best movies,

always works out,

19:43.874 --> 19:45.683
