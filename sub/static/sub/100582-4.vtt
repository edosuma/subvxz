WILLIAM: I'm gonna tear you
apart piece by piece!

52:19.020 --> 52:20.729
Please! Help me!
He's insane.

52:20.813 --> 52:23.646
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off of me.

52:23.729 --> 52:25.145
Don't hurt him!
It's okay, I'm okay!

52:25.229 --> 52:26.854
It's not his fault.
He's sick.

52:27.437 --> 52:28.479
I'm not sick.

52:28.563 --> 52:31.271
Don't you understand?
This isn't Charlotte Hale.

52:31.895 --> 52:33.979
It's an impostor, a host.

52:34.062 --> 52:36.396
She's not real!
None of this is real.

52:37.271 --> 52:41.604
(GROANS) None of this
is fucking real!

52:41.688 --> 52:43.604
What the hell
are you guys doing?

52:43.688 --> 52:45.604
You work for me,
goddammit!

52:46.104 --> 52:47.271
You work for me!

52:47.354 --> 52:51.854
William, I told you.
These aren't Delos employees.

52:51.937 --> 52:54.271
They work at a private
mental health hospital.

52:55.479 --> 52:56.604
You need help.

52:59.688 --> 53:01.729
Now that you're being committed,
I have to inform you

53:01.813 --> 53:03.604
that the board
will deem you incompetent,

53:03.688 --> 53:05.312
and all of your voting shares
will transfer

53:05.396 --> 53:06.895
to the current acting president.

53:07.563 --> 53:09.062
-Me.
-No.

53:09.145 --> 53:12.937
No! No! No!

53:13.020 --> 53:15.563
No, goddamn you!

53:15.646 --> 53:16.771
(GROANING) No!

53:35.354 --> 53:38.271
(WHISPERING)
I promised I'd let you
destroy yourself one day.

53:39.479 --> 53:42.479
Here we are. At last.

53:52.145 --> 53:53.937
(GRUNTS) Leave me alone, please!

53:54.020 --> 53:57.271
-I'll pay you whatever you want.
-Oh, yeah?

53:57.354 --> 53:59.437
Pay me with what?
Huh?

53:59.521 --> 54:01.521
-I have all your money.
-What?

54:03.062 --> 54:04.771
Who the fuck are you?

54:04.854 --> 54:06.854
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

54:07.354 --> 54:08.396
I'm with her.

55:57.437 --> 55:59.854
I guess there is some justice
after all.

56:10.479 --> 56:12.937
You know,
this was Emily's last wish.

56:15.354 --> 56:18.437
That you spend your days
rotting in an institution.

56:21.020 --> 56:22.937
Prisoner of your own sins.

56:31.312 --> 56:32.312
I guess you've reached

56:32.396 --> 56:34.271
the center
of your maze, William.

56:41.563 --> 56:44.688
(SIGHS) But the maze
is about understanding.

56:47.646 --> 56:50.145
You still don't even
understand who you are.

56:55.354 --> 57:00.646
If any of this was your choice,
wouldn't you already know?

57:07.771 --> 57:09.479
Ask me the question, William.

57:12.396 --> 57:14.729
The answer you so desperately
want to know.

57:29.729 --> 57:32.563
Am... I...
