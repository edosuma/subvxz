00:01.753 --> 00:05.518
(Marnie) Two years ago.
Before I even knew I was a witch.

00:05.589 --> 00:08.955
That was the last time
I was in halloweentown.

00:13.261 --> 00:17.720
My mom Gwen.
My grandma aggie. My sister Sophie

00:17.798 --> 00:20.631
and my brother Dylan and I
all had to join together

00:20.701 --> 00:24.864
and use the power of the cromwell
witch family to defeat kalabar.

00:24.938 --> 00:28.498
An evil warlock who's had a thing
for my mother since they were teenagers.

00:31.876 --> 00:35.038
Halloweentown
was always a happy place

00:35.113 --> 00:40.379
where creatures of different sizes
and shapes and species -

00:40.450 --> 00:42.679
some of them downright weird -

00:42.752 --> 00:46.482
could live apart from the real world
in peace and harmony.

00:48.390 --> 00:51.620
So. After we saved halloweentown.

00:51.692 --> 00:54.684
Grandma decided
to leave her comfy house there

00:54.761 --> 00:57.423
and live with our family
in the mortal world.

00:59.431 --> 01:02.264
Now it's Halloween night again.

01:02.334 --> 01:07.032
The only night we can pass freely
between halloweentown and our world.

01:07.338 --> 01:10.704
I'm thinking about halloweentown.

01:10.774 --> 01:12.799
I wonder how it's changed.

01:18.180 --> 01:23.013
Grandma says things in halloweentown
are always changing.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.543
I know nothing has changed at our house.

01:31.724 --> 01:34.419
Mom and grandma are fighting again.

01:34.492 --> 01:37.120
(Female computer voice)
What's going on at your party?

01:37.194 --> 01:39.856
Ehh... I'm avoiding it.

01:53.007 --> 01:55.498
Why?
What's the matter?

01:55.576 --> 01:58.635
(Sophie) Marnie,
grandma wants you to come down.

01:58.711 --> 02:01.679
([Music] Rock)

02:01.747 --> 02:04.545
One per customer, please.

02:07.718 --> 02:11.847
Yes, we have hats for everybody.
Everybody, now, don't...

02:11.922 --> 02:14.618
Don't fight. No fighting.
Witches don't fight.

02:14.691 --> 02:18.182
Oh, now, if you're going to be
real witches and warlocks,

02:18.260 --> 02:22.059
we need brooms, too, right?
Here we go.

02:30.403 --> 02:33.803
Ooh! Magic, magic, brooms, brooms.
There you are, dear.

02:33.872 --> 02:36.739
You got here just at the right time, marnie.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.901
Now, perhaps you'd like
to take our little partygoers

02:39.977 --> 02:43.377
for a little spin around the house.

02:43.446 --> 02:46.176
Grandma, I don't think
this is a very good idea.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.546
What? Oh, fiddle.

02:48.617 --> 02:52.848
I can't let your mother
spoil my fun every day of the year.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.047
- Mother.
- Oh, hello, dear.

02:55.122 --> 02:57.090
I spend all of my time trying to keep you

02:57.158 --> 02:58.749
from turning my own daughters
against me.

02:58.825 --> 03:00.986
Now you're gonna corrupt
all the children in the neighborhood.

03:01.061 --> 03:03.324
Mom, we're not turning against you.

03:03.395 --> 03:07.558
My dear, if you want to reject your heritage,
that's your business,

03:07.632 --> 03:12.659
but someone has to take my place
as head of the cromwell line,

03:12.736 --> 03:16.194
and I know marnie is just the stuff.

03:16.272 --> 03:18.467
Or me.
I'd be good, too.

03:18.541 --> 03:20.839
- That's right. That's right.
- All right, dress-up's over.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.673
We've got bobbing for apples
right over there.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.542
- (Children groaning)
- Oh, yes, it's fun. It's fun. Go play.

03:26.614 --> 03:28.605
Well, I hope you're happy.

03:28.682 --> 03:31.582
Oh, ecstatic.

03:35.787 --> 03:37.846
I'll take grandma.

03:43.127 --> 03:46.425
(Woman) Hey. Gort. Are you home?

03:46.496 --> 03:48.862
- (Gruff voice) What do you want?
- Hi. Gort.

03:48.932 --> 03:53.300
I'm asking everyone for a small donation
for the halloweentown school.

03:53.369 --> 03:54.995
Forget it. Astrid.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.128
I don't give to charity.

03:57.205 --> 04:00.901
Astrid, you're forever the optimist.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.965
That's gort, right?

04:03.043 --> 04:05.408
He's the one who steals the socks?

04:05.478 --> 04:08.571
Oh, he doesn't steal them.

04:08.647 --> 04:11.582
He's more like a junk magnet.

04:11.650 --> 04:14.709
Everything in the universe that gets lost -

04:14.785 --> 04:19.016
that other sock,
the last piece of the Jigsaw puzzle,

04:19.088 --> 04:22.648
the earring you put down for just a second -

04:22.724 --> 04:26.717
they all end up in gort's front yard.

04:26.795 --> 04:30.821
Not that he's willing to part with any of it.

04:30.898 --> 04:33.559
(Jingling sound)

04:33.633 --> 04:36.193
(Sophie) Oh, look, there's Benny.

04:36.269 --> 04:40.329
Why don't you go back to halloweentown
tonight while the portal's open?

04:40.406 --> 04:44.000
I know you miss Astrid and Benny
and all your friends there.

04:44.075 --> 04:46.065
(Chuckles)

04:47.477 --> 04:52.880
After a year away,
going back for just a few hours...

04:52.949 --> 04:56.111
Is harder than not going back at all.

04:56.184 --> 04:59.381
No, I'll just wait till next Halloween,

04:59.454 --> 05:01.944
and then I can take marnie for the year.

05:02.022 --> 05:06.048
But won't a year in halloweentown
feel like 100 years to her?

05:06.125 --> 05:12.222
Oh, becoming the head of the cromwell
witches takes commitment, Sophie.

05:12.297 --> 05:14.196
She can't live in both worlds.

05:14.265 --> 05:16.233
She has to choose.

05:16.300 --> 05:19.234
Ohh, look, look, look.
There's Luke.

05:19.302 --> 05:22.396
Oh, he's becoming a fine young goblin,
hasn't he?

05:22.472 --> 05:24.962
Look, look. H...

05:27.309 --> 05:30.471
- What's the matter, dear?
- Somebody's coming.

05:31.779 --> 05:34.008
Who?

05:34.081 --> 05:36.379
I don't know.

05:36.450 --> 05:39.441
- Come on.
- Well, I... I...

05:39.518 --> 05:42.782
Do you think it could be someone...
I didn't invite anyo...

05:42.854 --> 05:44.981
Come on, grandma. Hide.

05:47.058 --> 05:48.490
And do the thingy with your door.

05:48.559 --> 05:51.027
It's not supposed to be there
when we have guests.

05:51.095 --> 05:53.392
Ohh, your mother's rules.

05:56.765 --> 05:59.325
- Mom.
- What?

06:00.836 --> 06:03.565
I... I'm not turning against you.

06:04.905 --> 06:06.599
I love you.

06:06.673 --> 06:10.938
But I'm a witch.
I can't just not be.

06:11.010 --> 06:13.205
I'm sorry that I got mad at you.

06:13.278 --> 06:16.178
It's just so frustrating.

06:16.247 --> 06:18.579
I want you to learn what I know, too.

06:18.650 --> 06:21.243
Magic can give you whatever you wish for,

06:21.318 --> 06:25.083
but nothing's worth anything
if you can get it just by wishing.

06:25.154 --> 06:29.352
- That's what your dad taught me.
- But I don't use magic for everything.

06:30.325 --> 06:32.657
I don't use it on tests.

06:32.727 --> 06:35.957
All right.
There was that one algebra test...

06:36.030 --> 06:37.793
Marnie, you can't pick and choose.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.389
If you go to halloweentown for a year,
that's gonna become your life.

06:40.466 --> 06:43.901
You're a stranger
in this world after that.

06:43.969 --> 06:46.301
Knock, knock.

06:48.106 --> 06:50.198
The bomb.

06:50.274 --> 06:53.765
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

06:53.843 --> 06:55.640
Dad, I found 'em.

07:00.015 --> 07:02.449
Hi, I'm Alex.
This is my son Cal.

07:02.518 --> 07:05.748
We just moved in down the street,
and we heard about your party.

07:05.820 --> 07:10.449
Oh, well, welcome to the neighborhood.
I'm Gwen, and this is my daughter marnie.

07:10.524 --> 07:11.923
Hi.

07:13.292 --> 07:17.057
If all witches were as pretty as you,
they'd have a better reputation.

07:18.430 --> 07:20.762
Oh. Thanks.

07:20.832 --> 07:23.231
Can I put those in the freezer for you?

07:23.300 --> 07:26.700
Whatever you want.
They're for you. Uh, for the party.

07:26.769 --> 07:29.602
I hope you like lime.
Green's my favorite color.

07:29.672 --> 07:31.002
Ok.

07:32.941 --> 07:34.670
Is the rest of your family coming, too?

07:34.743 --> 07:37.006
Oh, it's just me and Cal.

07:37.578 --> 07:40.740
Oh. Well, lime is good.

07:41.214 --> 07:44.012
- Good.
- I've got some scoops over here.

07:44.084 --> 07:46.210
(Alex) Let me help you.

07:46.285 --> 07:48.378
(Whispers) Rrarr!

07:49.421 --> 07:51.547
That's Cindy.

07:51.622 --> 07:53.419
Yeah.

07:53.491 --> 07:57.984
Well, it's a little crowded in here.
You wanna give me a tour?

07:58.061 --> 08:00.585
Sure.
Let's go this way.

08:04.966 --> 08:07.127
This is it.

08:07.202 --> 08:11.467
- So, um, when did you move in?
- Just tonight, actually.

08:11.538 --> 08:16.236
Really? And your dad let you come
to our party? Don't you have to unpack?

08:16.309 --> 08:18.708
No. My dad doesn't waste his breath
on stuff like that.

08:18.777 --> 08:21.610
He lets me figure it out myself.

08:26.951 --> 08:29.077
Uh, so has anyone
asked you to go with them

08:29.152 --> 08:31.780
to the costume party at the high school?

08:33.388 --> 08:36.721
Why?
Did you want to ask me?

08:36.792 --> 08:39.885
Well, that depends on whether or not
that would be ridiculous.

08:39.961 --> 08:42.861
Dylan, you're not even wearing a costume.

08:42.929 --> 08:46.694
Oh. Well, I'm not really into
the whole Halloween thing.

08:46.766 --> 08:50.031
But that's the whole point of the party.

08:50.102 --> 08:53.264
Most disgusting costume wins a prize
after the unmasking at midnight.

08:53.338 --> 08:56.704
- Might that prize be a kiss?
- That's disgusting.

08:57.808 --> 09:00.503
(Laughs)

09:00.576 --> 09:05.036
(Marnie) When we moved in last year,
I finally got my own room.

09:05.114 --> 09:07.673
- Huh.
- What?

09:07.749 --> 09:11.445
Oh, I don't know. It's just,
usually people's rooms look like 'em.

09:11.519 --> 09:14.147
Yours doesn't.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.120
What do you mean?

09:16.189 --> 09:20.022
Well, you strike me as unconventional,
but in a good way.

09:21.193 --> 09:25.856
Yeah, well, my room is kind of ordinary.

09:25.930 --> 09:29.365
My mom likes ordinary, I guess.

09:29.432 --> 09:31.423
Oh, she's the boss, huh?

09:33.602 --> 09:37.038
Well, there is my grandma's room.

09:37.106 --> 09:39.665
Why?
What's hers like?

09:41.643 --> 09:42.735
I'll show you.

09:48.047 --> 09:50.242
Was that there before?

09:51.984 --> 09:53.382
Shh.

09:53.451 --> 09:56.716
This is a secret.

10:03.827 --> 10:05.727
Wow.

10:05.795 --> 10:07.523
This is so cool.

10:07.596 --> 10:10.156
Does she do it like this every Halloween?

10:10.232 --> 10:13.064
She's very into the whole witch thing.

10:13.134 --> 10:16.625
Um, stories, I mean, about witches.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.103
(Cal) Yeah, I guess so.

10:19.172 --> 10:22.436
"Hair of werewolf."

10:22.508 --> 10:25.601
- This must not be easy to get.
- It wasn't, believe m...

10:25.677 --> 10:30.170
Um, I mean, in the old days of fairy tales.

10:31.415 --> 10:34.441
Oh. So you know about this witch stuff, too.

10:34.518 --> 10:37.179
- A little.
- Do you know any magic spells?

10:37.253 --> 10:40.688
Well, sure,
but they're pretend ones, of course.

10:40.755 --> 10:44.088
See, there are common spells
that every witch knows -

10:44.159 --> 10:46.786
I mean, supposedly -

10:46.861 --> 10:49.226
and then there are the really secret ones

10:49.295 --> 10:52.093
that are only known
to the witch who made them up.

10:52.165 --> 10:54.632
Or warlock.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.760
That's what male witches
are called, right? Warlocks?

10:57.836 --> 11:00.463
So you've been doing some reading, too.

11:00.538 --> 11:03.904
Just movies and stuff,
but they're not really that educational.

11:03.974 --> 11:07.501
Well, grandma feels like
witches are misunderstood,

11:07.577 --> 11:11.012
so she likes to teach us about them.

11:11.447 --> 11:14.006
Whoa. Is that supposed
to be a book of spells?

11:14.082 --> 11:15.811
No.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.779
I mean...

11:18.852 --> 11:24.653
Yes, that's what it's supposed to be.
But you can't touch it.

11:24.724 --> 11:27.123
Oh, come on.
It's just pretend, right?

11:27.192 --> 11:30.684
Well, sure, but it's still my grandma's stuff,

11:30.762 --> 11:35.061
and we really shouldn't be in here
when she's not here, so I...

11:35.132 --> 11:36.792
Ok.

11:39.035 --> 11:42.197
- So, you like ice cream?
- Sure.

11:42.271 --> 11:45.434
All right.

12:06.857 --> 12:08.791
- Oh, thanks.
- Do you want some, son?

12:08.859 --> 12:10.689
Actually,
I think I'm gonna head home, dad.

12:10.760 --> 12:14.786
I think I'll stay around here
and help out... if that's ok.

12:14.863 --> 12:16.956
Oh, I never turn down help.

12:17.032 --> 12:20.523
Hey, marnie, I'm not enrolled yet,

12:20.601 --> 12:23.763
but I hear there's this really big costume
party at the high school.

12:23.836 --> 12:28.397
I figured if my costume's good enough,
maybe I could crash it.

12:28.473 --> 12:31.909
Well, let's see.
If you went with a student who is enrolled,

12:31.977 --> 12:34.809
then maybe you wouldn't have to crash it.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.972
Pick you up in an hour?

12:37.048 --> 12:39.515
Yeah, sure.

12:39.582 --> 12:41.209
(Whispers) Yes!

12:43.052 --> 12:45.350
Meeting you is everything
I hoped it would be.

12:57.663 --> 12:59.722
I don't see anyone.

13:07.371 --> 13:10.397
(Reciting spell)

13:24.617 --> 13:26.949
- And one for you.
- Ooh.

13:27.020 --> 13:29.351
And one for you, and...

13:31.924 --> 13:33.357
Where's mine?

13:36.794 --> 13:38.625
It's empty.

13:38.696 --> 13:40.424
Well, dear, it's always empty.

13:40.497 --> 13:43.159
That's why it's magic
when we pull things out of it.

13:43.233 --> 13:46.531
Grandma, there's nothing in there,
not even by magic.

13:46.602 --> 13:48.694
Well, that's impossible.

13:52.140 --> 13:54.471
Oh. Oh, well, I'm sorry, kids.

13:54.541 --> 13:58.476
I guess... I guess that is all there is.

13:58.544 --> 14:01.411
Just my luck.

14:01.948 --> 14:06.680
Well, I can't...
I've had this for centuries.

14:06.752 --> 14:09.743
It's never been empty before.

14:09.820 --> 14:12.310
- Empty?
- Well, it's no wonder.

14:12.389 --> 14:16.223
Every day for two years,
pulling out bat games, dancing skeletons,

14:16.292 --> 14:19.158
enchanted toads,
back issues of magic monthly...

14:19.228 --> 14:22.253
And, hey, let's not forget the ogre
with the flatulence problem.

14:22.330 --> 14:25.060
Stinky.
I miss him.

14:25.932 --> 14:30.698
It just can't run out. It's connected
to my house back in halloweentown

14:30.770 --> 14:34.206
with all my charms and all my spells.

14:34.273 --> 14:38.504
Oh, perhaps I should just
pop back up to halloweentown,

14:38.576 --> 14:40.736
just... just to look at my house.

14:40.811 --> 14:42.210
Can I go?
Can I go?

14:42.279 --> 14:44.406
Oh, forget it, Sophie.

14:44.481 --> 14:46.448
Mom already put the big foot down.

14:46.516 --> 14:47.915
None of us can go.

14:47.984 --> 14:53.512
Well, perhaps if I said that I need your help
with a technical problem.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.714
I'll get my coat.

14:56.957 --> 14:58.481
This'll never work.

14:58.559 --> 15:00.753
Oh, no, let me do the talking, dear.

15:00.827 --> 15:04.023
I'll use my utmost powers of persuasion.

15:04.096 --> 15:06.462
(Chuckles)

15:06.532 --> 15:08.658
It'll work.

15:08.733 --> 15:11.793
And here I thought we were going
to avoid the annual family meltdown.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.358
Ha.

15:15.172 --> 15:17.106
What we're made of,
do you know what I mean?

15:17.174 --> 15:18.367
I do. Just the other day...

15:18.441 --> 15:22.138
Honey, I'm taking the girls out
for a little while. Is that all right?

15:22.211 --> 15:24.144
Sure, mom.
Just make sure...

15:24.212 --> 15:26.976
Wait.
Out where?

15:27.048 --> 15:29.277
Oh, just home.
We'll be back in a jiffy.

15:32.452 --> 15:35.421
Oh, how do you do?
I'm aggie, Gwen's mother.

15:35.488 --> 15:36.647
Nice to meet you.

15:36.721 --> 15:38.086
- I'm Alex.
- Mother...

15:38.156 --> 15:41.488
Marnie's going to be staying with me
for a whole year

15:41.559 --> 15:43.789
after she gets out of high school.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.522
Isn't that fabulous?

15:45.596 --> 15:46.926
How lucky for her.

15:46.996 --> 15:50.727
Yes, and Sophie is going to stay with me.

15:50.799 --> 15:52.027
Mom!

15:52.101 --> 15:58.369
Sweetheart, it's your bedtime. Why don't
you go upstairs and start getting ready?

16:03.410 --> 16:05.104
We'll be back soon, mom.

16:05.177 --> 16:06.735
Don't worry.

16:06.812 --> 16:08.074
Ok?

16:09.881 --> 16:14.113
You see?
Your mother can be reasonable.

16:14.185 --> 16:17.779
We should have a stranger there
for all our family discussions.

16:17.855 --> 16:23.383
If she wants to check on us,
you tell her to call me on my head phone.

16:23.459 --> 16:25.551
You mean cell phone.

16:25.627 --> 16:27.492
- Head phone.
- Ew!

16:27.562 --> 16:29.028
What good are those things?

16:29.096 --> 16:31.656
Well, they're a little bit
like your walkie-talkies...

16:31.732 --> 16:33.756
(Whispers) Except they work like magic.

16:33.833 --> 16:35.494
(Aggie's voice)
Except they work like magic.

16:35.568 --> 16:36.830
Ohh!

16:36.903 --> 16:39.234
They can even be used to communicate

16:39.304 --> 16:41.397
between the mortal world
and halloweentown.

16:41.473 --> 16:43.633
I invented them myself.

16:43.708 --> 16:46.939
Aren't they cute?
Anyway, it probably won't be a problem,

16:47.011 --> 16:49.808
because you know we're gonna
be home before midnight.

16:49.880 --> 16:53.144
We'll be back in an hour,
because I have a date.

16:55.818 --> 16:59.651
And I've never understood
why you bother with that Internet thing

16:59.721 --> 17:04.123
when my witch's glass can show you
anything you want to know.

17:06.358 --> 17:10.954
Wait. Isn't this where
the bus stop's supposed to be?

17:11.029 --> 17:15.227
Oh, yes. Oh, Arnold must have forgot
to put the thing out again.

17:15.300 --> 17:20.792
I swear, that man would lose his head
if his wife didn't put it in his lunchbox.

17:20.869 --> 17:25.238
(Laughs) Well... I'll summon the bus.

17:25.307 --> 17:27.298
- Good.
- Ahem.

17:28.277 --> 17:30.836
Gestum ex alius mundus

17:30.912 --> 17:35.814
nos te appello ut adduco domus!

17:37.651 --> 17:41.746
- Didn't I say it right?
- Try it again with more feeling.

17:41.820 --> 17:44.515
Ok. Ahem.

17:44.589 --> 17:47.183
Gestum ex alius mundus

17:47.258 --> 17:51.125
nos te appello ut adduco domus!

17:52.729 --> 17:57.688
Well, I guess we'll just have to
call up the portal ourselves.

18:00.335 --> 18:03.098
(Both) From the mortal world
depart we now,

18:03.170 --> 18:05.968
on this, the night, all hallow's Eve,

18:06.040 --> 18:07.631
back into halloweentown.

18:07.707 --> 18:11.234
Through the portal we take our leave.

18:13.712 --> 18:15.612
Four hours till midnight.

18:15.681 --> 18:18.706
We'll be back in plenty of time.

18:32.860 --> 18:36.158
Has anyone ever told you
you have the most beautiful green eyes?

18:37.564 --> 18:41.795
They're like two lily pads
floating on a crystal-clear lake.

18:43.970 --> 18:46.062
Look, I don't want to be too forward,

18:46.137 --> 18:48.799
but would you consider being my date
for the costume party?

18:48.873 --> 18:51.306
- At the high school?
- Yeah.

18:51.375 --> 18:53.366
That's just for the students.

18:53.444 --> 18:56.537
Oh, I'm sure they can
always use more chaperones.

18:56.613 --> 19:00.446
Hey, it'll give me an excuse
to see you again.

19:00.515 --> 19:02.847
Well, I don't even have a costume.

19:02.918 --> 19:05.511
Oh, that's all right.
Cal's got loads of stuff back at the house.

19:05.586 --> 19:08.282
I'm sure we can find you something.

19:09.456 --> 19:12.892
All right. Sure.
I'd like that.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.585
Great.

19:14.660 --> 19:17.356
Well... till then.

19:17.830 --> 19:19.729
Till then.

19:24.735 --> 19:28.363
I was just curious.

19:28.437 --> 19:30.962
- Thanks for stopping by.
- (Croaks)

19:32.074 --> 19:34.041
(Croaking)

19:34.109 --> 19:36.407
Same to you.

19:36.478 --> 19:39.878
(Croaking)

19:49.054 --> 19:52.113
Oh, it feels so good to be back.

19:52.189 --> 19:54.453
Sophie was right.

19:54.525 --> 19:58.654
I needed to come home.
I've been missing my friends terribly.

20:02.464 --> 20:04.364
Where's the big Jack-o'-lantern?

20:06.601 --> 20:09.434
Is this some kind of joke?

20:09.504 --> 20:13.837
(Aggie) As goes the Jack-o'-lantern,
so goes halloweentown.

20:16.876 --> 20:20.106
Grandma, what's happened?

20:21.446 --> 20:25.176
Everything's kind of gray and boring.

20:25.249 --> 20:28.685
Not just everything.
Everybody.

20:28.752 --> 20:30.446
Wait, please.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.420
Could you tell me what's happening here?

20:32.488 --> 20:34.614
I would just like...

20:34.690 --> 20:37.818
Astrid, is that you?

20:37.893 --> 20:40.292
I'm Astrid.

20:40.361 --> 20:43.454
Astrid, what's happened to you?

20:43.530 --> 20:45.395
What do you mean?

20:45.465 --> 20:50.367
Well, I mean, you're turning gray
and your bell-bottoms are gone.

20:50.903 --> 20:53.666
And your shoes. Ooh!

20:55.406 --> 20:57.896
These are very comfortable.

20:57.974 --> 21:00.408
Sensible shoes are important.

21:00.477 --> 21:02.410
I think I'll buy some more.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.844
Ohh, Astrid.

21:04.914 --> 21:06.972
Oh, excuse me.

21:07.615 --> 21:09.014
I was talking.

21:09.084 --> 21:10.381
Whatever.

21:10.452 --> 21:13.113
Oh, I hate that word.

21:13.187 --> 21:15.348
Wait a minute.

21:15.422 --> 21:16.979
Dear...

21:18.191 --> 21:19.681
Do I know you?

21:20.126 --> 21:21.717
Duh.

21:21.793 --> 21:24.921
It can't be. Luke?

21:25.696 --> 21:27.960
Yeah.

21:28.032 --> 21:31.262
But you look just like you did
when kalabar put that spell on you

21:31.334 --> 21:33.734
and turned you human.

21:33.803 --> 21:35.565
Whatever.

21:37.172 --> 21:39.163
Would you stop that?

21:39.241 --> 21:41.401
Look, what is going on?

21:41.476 --> 21:45.343
- Why are you turning gray?
- Everybody's doing it.

21:45.412 --> 21:49.109
- That's not what I mean.
- It's the spell, dear.

21:49.182 --> 21:53.914
A spell? You think someone
put a spell on all of halloweentown?

21:53.985 --> 21:57.921
- How could they do that?
- I'm not sure.

21:57.989 --> 22:04.222
But the spell seems to be turning
the creatures not only gray,

22:04.293 --> 22:08.490
but once it progresses far enough,
into humans.

22:08.563 --> 22:11.760
Come on, grandma.
Humans aren't this boring.

22:11.833 --> 22:14.460
No.

22:14.535 --> 22:19.801
I should say this is the caricature
of humans in halloweentown,

22:19.873 --> 22:24.809
just as humans make fun of us
from the mortal world at Halloween.

22:25.611 --> 22:28.408
But who would cast a spell like this?

22:28.479 --> 22:33.006
I don't know,
but someone is destroying my home.

22:33.083 --> 22:36.984
Ok, let's not get upset.

22:37.052 --> 22:39.782
Undoing spells isn't that hard, right?

22:39.855 --> 22:41.754
You just say 'em backwards.

22:41.823 --> 22:46.191
I remember... I remember something
from my spell book. It was a spell...

22:46.260 --> 22:49.855
Well, I haven't looked at it in years,

22:49.930 --> 22:51.692
but it was similar to this.

22:51.764 --> 22:55.097
Well, great. Then maybe
the spell in your book can cure it.

22:55.168 --> 22:56.794
It's worth a try.

22:58.637 --> 23:01.104
Dylan? Dylan?
Oh, Dylan.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.299
Are you there?
Can you hear me?

23:03.374 --> 23:06.240
Dylan, will you please answer this?

23:06.309 --> 23:08.436
Dylan. Can you hear me?

23:08.511 --> 23:10.637
Dylan. Are you there?

23:10.712 --> 23:13.306
Dylan. Will you please answer me?

23:13.382 --> 23:14.871
All right, I hear you.
What do you want?

23:14.949 --> 23:19.715
I want you to go into my room
and read me a spell out of my book.

23:19.786 --> 23:21.083
Grandma, I'm busy.

23:21.154 --> 23:23.145
Oh! Oh...

23:23.223 --> 23:25.349
Just do it, Dylan,

23:25.424 --> 23:27.790
or I'll spam your diary all over the net.

23:27.860 --> 23:29.224
You don't know my password.

23:29.294 --> 23:32.024
Wanna bet, iron buns?

23:32.096 --> 23:33.460
Shh. Ok, I'll do it.

23:35.232 --> 23:38.632
(Chuckles) Iron buns.

23:40.403 --> 23:42.700
I should have been allowed to go, too.

23:42.771 --> 23:45.331
Yeah.
Just open the door.

23:47.842 --> 23:49.139
We're in.

23:49.810 --> 23:51.277
Oh!

23:51.345 --> 23:53.312
Gotcha.

23:53.379 --> 23:57.872
- Look, just find the spell book, all right?
- It's not here.

23:57.950 --> 24:00.783
What do you mean. It's not there?
It should be on the table.

24:00.853 --> 24:03.047
- Well, it's not.
- It has to be.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.553
Maybe grandma misplaced it.

24:04.622 --> 24:08.921
Dylan, it's huge.
How's she gonna "misplace" it?

24:08.992 --> 24:13.553
- She misplaced the ogre.
- Stinky liked playing hide and seek.

24:14.029 --> 24:16.053
Someone must have taken it.

24:16.130 --> 24:19.657
Did any of you go to my room
since I came down to the party?

24:19.734 --> 24:21.826
- Not me.
- Not me.

24:24.638 --> 24:28.971
Um, well, I was, for a few minutes.

24:29.408 --> 24:32.069
Well, did someone go in with you?

24:32.143 --> 24:34.610
Just this boy I met - Cal -

24:34.678 --> 24:37.647
but he couldn't have taken it,
'cause I was with him the whole time.

24:37.715 --> 24:39.648
He must be the one I felt coming.

24:39.716 --> 24:41.308
He stole it, grandma.

24:41.384 --> 24:45.479
It could have been somebody else. I mean,
we've been gone for almost an hour.

24:45.554 --> 24:48.318
Well, only you, grandma and Sophie
know the spell to get in.

24:49.056 --> 24:51.286
Children, you seal my room.

24:51.359 --> 24:55.590
I'm going to go back and have a talk
with marnie's new friend.

25:04.502 --> 25:08.733
He wouldn't steal anything, grandma.
He's really sweet.

25:08.805 --> 25:12.900
Perhaps, but for the moment,
he's our only suspect.

25:12.975 --> 25:15.034
Mm.

25:16.712 --> 25:20.306
(Both)
From halloweentown depart we now,

25:20.382 --> 25:23.748
on this, the night, all hallow's Eve,

25:23.817 --> 25:26.284
back into the mortal world.

25:26.352 --> 25:28.547
Through the portal we take our leave.

25:32.357 --> 25:34.985
The... the portal won't open.

25:35.060 --> 25:36.822
Oh, it's just as I feared.

25:36.894 --> 25:40.454
Whoever cast this gray spell
knew it would affect my suitcase

25:40.530 --> 25:43.397
and knew we'd come to investigate.
It was a trap.

25:43.466 --> 25:47.902
(Cal) Very good, aggie.
You're keeping up nicely.

25:47.970 --> 25:49.437
Cal?

25:49.505 --> 25:51.301
Over here.

25:54.142 --> 25:58.134
Cal?
You cast the spell on halloweentown?

25:58.211 --> 26:04.148
Just the way it was written in aggie's
little spell book. You naughty girl.

26:04.215 --> 26:07.184
I knew it seemed familiar.

26:07.252 --> 26:09.719
But... but then you'd have to be a w...

26:09.787 --> 26:12.620
A warlock?
Sweet, huh?

26:12.690 --> 26:15.385
So then that whole thing -

26:15.458 --> 26:17.426
your so-called dad,

26:17.493 --> 26:21.929
the tour of the house -
it was just to get the book.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.863
No, I could have stolen the book anytime.

26:24.932 --> 26:30.335
See, I wanted you to show it to me
because you felt something between us,

26:30.403 --> 26:33.132
and you did.

26:33.205 --> 26:37.265
- You tricked me.
- Ha. You'll get over it.

26:37.342 --> 26:40.402
And, hey, I still need a date
to the costume party.

26:40.478 --> 26:42.342
Forget the party.

26:42.412 --> 26:44.676
I wanna know why...

26:48.250 --> 26:50.650
- Kalabar.
- What did you say, dear?

26:50.720 --> 26:53.119
The rose.

26:58.993 --> 27:02.052
You always did let
your magic do the talking.

27:02.128 --> 27:05.029
I should have known
when he gave me the rose.

27:07.733 --> 27:10.166
Cal.

27:10.234 --> 27:11.997
You're kalabar's son.

27:12.069 --> 27:16.801
And I guess I inherited my father's
attraction to cromwell witches.

27:16.873 --> 27:19.397
I didn't know kalabar had a child.

27:19.475 --> 27:22.273
He didn't want people to know.

27:22.344 --> 27:26.746
Dad and I didn't always agree, but he was
the only one that stood in the way

27:26.814 --> 27:30.044
of the cromwells' domination
of halloweentown.

27:30.117 --> 27:34.018
Oh, that's absurd.
The cromwells dominate no one.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.987
Then why'd you let the mortals
take charge of the earth

27:37.056 --> 27:40.218
while we had to hide like rats
in another dimension?

27:40.291 --> 27:46.092
Oh, we all voted to create our own world
so everyone could live in peace.

27:46.163 --> 27:49.461
And when my father tried to bring
the creatures of halloweentown

27:49.532 --> 27:52.500
back as rulers of the human race,

27:52.567 --> 27:55.559
you cromwells
brought everyone against him,

27:55.637 --> 27:57.661
and then you destroyed him!

27:57.738 --> 28:01.367
So that's what this is about - revenge.

28:01.442 --> 28:05.275
Just say the word,
and I'll open up the portal.

28:05.345 --> 28:07.209
Say what word?

28:07.279 --> 28:10.715
Stop doing everything
your mama tells you,

28:10.783 --> 28:16.378
and I can show you things that aggie
could not teach you in a million years.

28:16.453 --> 28:17.977
Ha!

28:18.055 --> 28:21.717
I'm not interested in your kind of magic.

28:21.791 --> 28:23.486
All you do is destroy.

28:23.559 --> 28:27.892
Oh, the gray spell
is just the first act, marnie.

28:27.962 --> 28:31.920
The finale will come at midnight
in the mortal world.

28:31.999 --> 28:35.832
- What finale?
- Join me and find out.

28:35.902 --> 28:37.893
No way.

28:37.970 --> 28:41.598
Well, you think about it, and, uh...

28:42.507 --> 28:44.497
Catch ya later.

28:50.547 --> 28:53.015
I'm sorry, grandma.

28:53.083 --> 28:55.073
I really blew it.

28:55.150 --> 28:58.313
We all make mistakes, dear,
but don't worry about it.

28:58.387 --> 29:02.755
We'll show Cal the cromwells
are not so easily beaten.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.222
But how?

29:04.291 --> 29:07.851
I mean, we're trapped here,
and... he's got your spell book.

29:07.927 --> 29:12.364
Well, I still have a few tricks up my sleeve.

29:12.431 --> 29:15.831
(Whistles)
First we have to get back to my house.

29:15.900 --> 29:20.199
Oh, thank goodness.
The taxicab is still working.

29:20.270 --> 29:25.297
Oh, now, on the way, you can call
your brother and give him an update

29:25.374 --> 29:30.333
while we find a way
to break this accursed spell.

29:30.412 --> 29:32.345
- Hmm?
- Ok.

29:38.852 --> 29:41.843
- Benny?
- Wow! Ahh...

29:41.920 --> 29:43.911
Need a ride?

29:43.989 --> 29:47.355
Uh, grandma, I think it's Benny.

29:49.861 --> 29:51.851
(Marnie) Can you drive any faster, Benny?

29:51.928 --> 29:54.624
(Aggie) Relax, marnie.
We've arrived.

29:54.698 --> 29:58.963
Wow. Turning gray sure has made you
a careful driver, Benny.

29:59.701 --> 30:01.464
- Have we met?
- Ohh...

30:01.536 --> 30:04.130
Well, yeah, but the last time,

30:04.205 --> 30:08.140
you were just skin and bones,
except for the skin.

30:08.208 --> 30:11.472
Thank you for the ride, dear.
We're in something of a hurry.

30:12.178 --> 30:15.578
Come on, children, let's get inside.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.480
What do you think
Cal's going to do to the mortal world?

30:18.550 --> 30:22.007
Well, he clearly shares
his father's hatred of humans,

30:22.086 --> 30:24.645
but if he's willing
to break the code of Merlin,

30:24.721 --> 30:28.656
which forbids stealing the spells of another,

30:28.724 --> 30:31.887
then I think that we can safely assume
that he's capable of anything.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.484
Now no more talk until we're inside,

30:34.562 --> 30:39.396
and even if he's still eavesdropping,
he won't be able to hear us in my house.

30:40.066 --> 30:41.761
I hope the gray spell hasn't changed an...

30:41.835 --> 30:45.600
(Gasp)... anything. Ohh.

30:50.341 --> 30:53.207
I like what you've done with the place.

30:53.277 --> 30:57.576
I can't believe Cal did this
with a spell out of your book.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.239
We'll never undo it.

30:59.315 --> 31:01.111
Oh, I'd agree with you, dear,

31:01.183 --> 31:04.380
if there was only one copy
of my spell book.

31:04.452 --> 31:07.682
But what he doesn't know is there are two.

31:08.622 --> 31:09.646
Two?

31:09.723 --> 31:12.555
They're matched sets,
two complete copies.

31:12.625 --> 31:15.752
I took the one I usually use
to the mortal world with me,

31:15.828 --> 31:18.695
and the other one is still here.

31:20.131 --> 31:21.428
Someplace.

31:21.499 --> 31:25.127
- Well, then, let's look for it.
- Oh, let's. Let's.

31:25.202 --> 31:26.863
- (High-pitched voice) Ok, yes.
- (High-pitched voice) Is it in there?

31:26.937 --> 31:28.734
No. Excuse me. Excu...

31:28.805 --> 31:30.567
Ok. Uh, no...

31:32.141 --> 31:34.574
Ok, maybe...
Oh, this is it. No. Aah!

31:37.178 --> 31:39.270
(Normal voice)
You can help out, you know.

31:39.346 --> 31:41.576
- I'm kinda hungry.
- Ohh!

31:41.648 --> 31:44.138
I wonder if there's anything
to eat around here.

31:44.217 --> 31:45.650
(Both. High-pitched voices) Oh!

31:45.718 --> 31:47.948
Maybe it's in here.
Maybe it's in here.

31:48.020 --> 31:50.351
It's gotta be here.
I know it is.

31:50.422 --> 31:53.515
(Normal voice) It's not here.

31:53.591 --> 31:54.717
(Sighs)

31:54.792 --> 31:58.727
- How about that one?
- No, that's not it. That's too small.

31:58.795 --> 32:01.263
- How about this? This?
- It's just a big... it's a big book.

32:01.331 --> 32:03.321
- No. Ok.
- Oh, my goodness.

32:03.398 --> 32:06.265
Then some of these.
Here, here. I know. Here. This is it.

32:06.335 --> 32:08.632
We can't find it.

32:08.703 --> 32:10.603
Grandma, we can't just give up.

32:10.671 --> 32:12.604
There's gotta be something
we haven't thought of, right?

32:12.672 --> 32:16.573
I mean, something
to get us out of this trap, a spell or...

32:16.642 --> 32:20.271
(Whooshing sound)

32:20.346 --> 32:23.906
- Luke!
- Yeah.

32:23.982 --> 32:25.972
Look!
You're a goblin again.

32:26.049 --> 32:27.880
Something broke the spell.

32:27.951 --> 32:29.680
I guess so.

32:29.753 --> 32:33.347
Well, what happened, grandma?
Did you say something?

32:33.422 --> 32:36.982
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Then how come I'm not gray anymore?

32:37.058 --> 32:40.754
Hmm. I suppose the spell
could be temporary.

32:40.828 --> 32:45.059
Then maybe the spell
on the house will wear off,

32:45.131 --> 32:46.564
and we can find your spell book.

32:46.633 --> 32:49.567
But if takes too long,
midnight will pass, and the mortal world...

32:49.635 --> 32:53.435
Grandma, you already said the spell book
isn't here. What else can we do?

32:53.505 --> 32:56.735
Well, I haven't seen
that other spell book for decades.

32:58.910 --> 33:02.470
Perhaps it's lost.

33:02.545 --> 33:06.036
Grandma, why are you smiling?
That's terrible.

33:06.115 --> 33:10.073
No, no, dear, not at all,
because, you see, if it's lost,

33:10.151 --> 33:13.483
I know just where it is.

33:13.553 --> 33:16.044
- Wait. Gimme that again?
- (Chuckles)

33:16.123 --> 33:21.025
Everything that's lost in both worlds
always ends up at gort's house.

33:21.093 --> 33:23.117
He's the junk man of the universe.

33:23.194 --> 33:24.855
Ohh! Excuse me.

33:24.930 --> 33:26.864
(Engine running)

33:31.368 --> 33:33.767
- Your receipt.
- Mail it, dear.

33:34.470 --> 33:38.200
Great, Benny.
Ok, now to gort's house, and step on it.

33:48.214 --> 33:51.080
You should see him
when he's not in a hurry.

33:54.653 --> 33:58.884
Good night.
Thank you so much for coming. Bye.

33:59.490 --> 34:01.252
- (Woman) Thanks very much.
- (Girl) Bye.

34:01.325 --> 34:04.294
Did grandma ever consider that
she might have misplaced the book?

34:04.361 --> 34:06.055
I tried that.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.119
Your grandmother thinks
everything's about magic.

34:08.197 --> 34:11.688
If she keeps this up, you kids are never
gonna grow up to be normal people.

34:11.766 --> 34:14.529
Grandma says being normal
is vastly overrated.

34:14.601 --> 34:16.466
And you should already be in bed.

34:16.536 --> 34:19.562
Marnie swears this kid Cal
is a warlock and that he stole it,

34:19.639 --> 34:22.870
- and about his dad...
- All right, that's enough.

34:22.942 --> 34:26.809
Ok, I think that it would be
a good idea if everyone around here

34:26.878 --> 34:29.641
started coming up with
simple explanations for things

34:29.714 --> 34:32.877
before they summoned up
the powers of darkness

34:32.949 --> 34:35.417
every time they're trying
to find their car keys.

34:35.485 --> 34:38.681
Now, Cal seems like a very
sweet and charming young man

34:38.754 --> 34:40.516
and his father seems li...

34:40.589 --> 34:43.351
(Gasp) Alex.

34:43.424 --> 34:47.018
Hey, Gwen.
Great costume, huh?

34:47.094 --> 34:50.188
- Hope I didn't scare you.
- Well, it is Halloween.

34:50.263 --> 34:54.358
And, to celebrate,
Cal and I found a terrific mask for you.

34:54.433 --> 34:56.594
Woo-ooo.

34:56.668 --> 34:58.363
Ew.

34:58.436 --> 35:00.904
Oh, it's...

35:01.506 --> 35:03.496
You don't like it.

35:03.574 --> 35:05.940
Oh, no.
It's... it's great.

35:06.010 --> 35:09.035
We are gonna be the hit
of the costume party.

35:09.112 --> 35:12.080
Oh, wait.
You're going to the Halloween party?

35:12.147 --> 35:15.707
Yes. Alex invited me, and...

35:15.783 --> 35:17.842
Oh, Sophie.

35:17.918 --> 35:19.408
I get to go, too?

35:19.487 --> 35:21.351
Oh, no, sweetie.
You should already be in bed.

35:21.421 --> 35:23.548
Oh, Alex, I'm so sorry.
I wasn't even thinking.

35:23.623 --> 35:27.456
Oh. Well, that's ok.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.687
It's no big deal.

35:31.496 --> 35:33.987
You guys go.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.827
I'll baby-sit Sophie.

35:35.899 --> 35:38.390
Dylan, no. You've been
looking forward to this for weeks.

35:38.468 --> 35:40.992
Let's face it, mom.
I'm just not that into Halloween.

35:41.070 --> 35:43.368
I mean, I was hoping
for a little social interaction,

35:43.439 --> 35:46.339
- but you're the one that's got the date.
- Did you ask Tiffany?

35:46.408 --> 35:47.966
- She was busy.
- Samantha?

35:48.043 --> 35:49.669
- Boyfriend.
- Julia?

35:49.743 --> 35:54.008
She laughed so hard
that milk came out of her nose.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.071
You guys go.
You can make it up to me later.

35:56.149 --> 35:59.276
- Are you sure?
- That is wonderful.

35:59.351 --> 36:01.717
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

36:01.787 --> 36:06.917
- You're not gonna give me warts, are you?
- That is a complete myth.

36:06.991 --> 36:11.154
- Bed.
- Don't make me laugh.

36:14.797 --> 36:16.355
Where'd all the junk go?

36:16.432 --> 36:19.525
Looks like gort's been straightening up
ever since the gray spell hit.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.090
Oh, you'd still better
prepare yourself, my dear.

36:22.169 --> 36:25.263
Spell or no spell, gort the rancorous

36:25.338 --> 36:29.501
is still the foulest, meanest, smelliest
inhabitant of halloweentown.

36:32.077 --> 36:34.671
Yes?

36:34.746 --> 36:38.943
Hello, gort.
You're looking... clean.

36:39.016 --> 36:41.609
Um, do you need something?

36:41.684 --> 36:45.881
I'm busy, you see, sorting my socks.

36:45.954 --> 36:49.048
Uh, yes, Mr. gort, sir.

36:49.124 --> 36:51.023
We were looking for a book.

36:51.092 --> 36:53.617
Oh, I see.

36:53.694 --> 36:55.524
Well, come right in.

36:55.595 --> 36:58.996
I have several books.

36:59.065 --> 37:00.622
Yes.

37:09.306 --> 37:11.900
(Gort) Well, here they are.

37:11.975 --> 37:16.206
Oh, thank you, gort.
"Proper toenail cutting."

37:16.278 --> 37:19.269
"Dusting for fun and profit"?

37:19.347 --> 37:22.339
"100 recipes for tapioca."

37:22.417 --> 37:25.351
You know, I don't think
whoever lost these is missing 'em much.

37:25.419 --> 37:27.818
Gort, these can't be
all the books you've got.

37:27.887 --> 37:33.188
Well, I sold the rest at the yard sale.

37:33.258 --> 37:34.418
Yard sale?

37:34.493 --> 37:37.893
Oh, yes.
This place was very messy.

37:37.962 --> 37:40.760
I only kept the useful books.

37:40.831 --> 37:45.767
I'll sell these socks, too,
as soon as I match them up.

37:45.835 --> 37:50.897
Gort, there was a particular book,
an extra copy of my spell book.

37:50.973 --> 37:53.236
Do you remember who you sold it to?

38:00.980 --> 38:03.312
Do you think these two match?

38:06.050 --> 38:09.247
No, I suppose not.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.810
Well, we've hit a dead end.

38:11.889 --> 38:14.722
You know, that book could be anywhere.

38:14.791 --> 38:18.191
Ok, I say we head back to the mortal world.

38:18.261 --> 38:22.026
- The spell - it's coming back.
- Ohh.

38:22.097 --> 38:25.190
Grandma, wh... what's happening?

38:25.266 --> 38:27.257
It's the gray spell.

38:27.334 --> 38:30.791
It's affecting me
now that we're in halloweentown.

38:30.870 --> 38:33.065
It's probably gonna go after you, too, dear.

38:33.139 --> 38:35.572
We've gotta get out of here.

38:42.780 --> 38:44.804
The door - it won't open.

38:44.881 --> 38:47.475
(Marnie) What?
There are no windows, either.

38:47.917 --> 38:50.112
Grandma, you gotta do something.

38:50.186 --> 38:53.313
Oh, dear.
Oh, I can't.

38:53.388 --> 38:56.949
The gray spell must be
draining our powers.

38:57.025 --> 38:58.924
(Cal) Right again, Agatha.

39:00.160 --> 39:04.755
(Laughs) You see, at this point, I could
keep you people in here with a toothpick.

39:04.830 --> 39:06.627
Grandma was right.

39:06.699 --> 39:09.292
You've been spying on us this whole time.

39:09.367 --> 39:13.564
Oh, I didn't need to. You see, I already
knew about aggie's little spell book.

39:13.637 --> 39:15.400
That's why I knew you'd end up at gort's.

39:15.472 --> 39:17.871
How could you?

39:17.941 --> 39:21.205
I lost that book before you were born.

39:21.276 --> 39:24.803
So, marnie, have you thought any more
about going to the party?

39:24.880 --> 39:28.645
I mean, everyone's gonna be there,
even your mom.

39:28.716 --> 39:32.310
My mom?
You're lying.

39:32.385 --> 39:34.410
My mom hates Halloween.

39:34.487 --> 39:37.011
Oh, I think my dad got her into the spirit.

39:37.089 --> 39:39.455
He's not really my dad, actually.
He's more of a science experiment.

39:39.525 --> 39:42.960
But he got her into a really ugly mask.
It's a scream.

39:43.027 --> 39:46.393
You know, this is not the way
to talk me into a date.

39:46.463 --> 39:50.228
This is more than a date.
This is our future together.

39:50.299 --> 39:55.531
I'm in control of my own future,
and it doesn't include you.

39:58.806 --> 40:00.501
Creature spell.

40:00.574 --> 40:03.872
- What?
- That's a spell in my book.

40:03.943 --> 40:08.276
It's a spell that was banned
after the dark times.

40:08.347 --> 40:15.013
It was used on humans who mocked us
by dressing up like creatures.

40:15.086 --> 40:21.957
It was used on them to turn them into
the very creatures they were mocking.

40:22.558 --> 40:25.391
He turned the creatures into humans,

40:25.461 --> 40:27.928
and now he's gonna
turn the humans into creatures.

40:27.996 --> 40:31.261
That's why Cal put your mother in a mask.

40:31.332 --> 40:36.734
I think he plans to use the creature spell
on the mortal world at midnight.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.436
Dylan.

40:52.682 --> 40:54.650
Do you want me
to read you a bedtime story?

40:54.717 --> 40:57.014
No. Listen.

40:57.085 --> 40:58.882
"Golems are very pleasant creatures

40:58.954 --> 41:02.184
"built entirely from mud
or other natural elements.

41:02.256 --> 41:06.123
They have no will of their own
and do whatever their creators tell them."

41:06.192 --> 41:08.683
Good. Be a golem.
Go to bed.

41:08.762 --> 41:12.162
You said you saw a frog on the floor
just after Cal's dad left.

41:12.231 --> 41:14.926
And then, later, he shows up
in a giant frog costume?

41:14.999 --> 41:18.696
What is this,
some sort of biblical plague thing?

41:18.770 --> 41:22.136
Sophie, mom hasn't gone out
with anyone in two years.

41:22.205 --> 41:25.662
I'm not going to that party just to tell her
that you think her date is a reptile.

41:25.741 --> 41:27.766
Frogs are amphibians.

41:27.843 --> 41:29.207
I'm not going.

41:29.277 --> 41:32.940
Somebody's gotta be here to water
the plants when they take you all away.

41:33.013 --> 41:35.607
Dylan, I can't do this by myself.

41:35.683 --> 41:38.378
Whether you like it or not,
you're a cromwell, too,

41:38.451 --> 41:41.011
and that means
you feel things just like we do.

41:41.087 --> 41:43.418
Tell me you don't feel
like something's wrong.

41:46.925 --> 41:48.619
Ok, maybe we'll go for a minute,

41:48.693 --> 41:50.991
but just to prove to you
that nothing is wrong.

41:51.062 --> 41:53.529
You'll need a costume.

42:01.136 --> 42:02.466
No way.

42:03.438 --> 42:07.669
Ok... he's keeping us in here with a spell,

42:07.741 --> 42:11.699
so maybe we can come up
with a stronger one.

42:11.777 --> 42:16.679
Oh, our powers are draining, dear.
I'm afraid we're trapped.

42:17.248 --> 42:22.082
But, grandma, saying a spell backwards
can't be the only way to undo it.

42:22.152 --> 42:24.643
Oh, rules are rules.

42:26.656 --> 42:29.420
But rules... rules have exceptions, right?

42:29.492 --> 42:31.686
I mean...

42:31.760 --> 42:35.820
Like... like how hackers
get into computer programs.

42:35.896 --> 42:38.956
They just look for the back door.

42:39.032 --> 42:40.761
Computers have back doors?

42:40.834 --> 42:45.031
Well, back doors are ways of getting
into a program if there's a problem.

42:46.905 --> 42:50.567
I wonder if spells have back doors.

42:50.641 --> 42:55.703
So you mean a way to weasel out of
the spell without actually breaking it.

42:55.779 --> 42:58.212
Right.
Like this spell.

42:58.280 --> 43:01.215
It's supposed to keep us
from getting outside, right?

43:01.283 --> 43:03.876
Yeah. So?

43:03.952 --> 43:08.411
So what if we tried to go somewhere else
other than outside?

43:08.489 --> 43:11.014
There is nowhere else.
There's only outside and inside,

43:11.091 --> 43:13.786
and right now, we're inside.

43:13.860 --> 43:17.386
Time travel. Oh, grandma,
you have a spell for that, right?

43:17.462 --> 43:19.692
Grandma,
do you have a spell for time travel?

43:19.765 --> 43:22.460
- Time-travel spell.
- Yeah.

43:22.533 --> 43:25.559
Oh, I believe I do.

43:25.636 --> 43:27.762
A lovely little poem.

43:27.837 --> 43:32.034
Gort... gort...
That sock doesn't match the other one.

43:32.107 --> 43:35.803
Grandma, grandma,
none of them match. Focus.

43:35.877 --> 43:39.472
Come on. Ooh, I know. Here, here.
You write it down, write, write.

43:39.547 --> 43:42.743
- What is it? What...? Just a minute.
- Give me that.

43:42.816 --> 43:46.342
- Write it down before you forget it.
- Spell, spell. Oh...

43:46.419 --> 43:47.750
Hurry, grandma.

43:47.820 --> 43:49.753
There.

43:49.821 --> 43:52.984
It's a little fuzzy... fuzzy there, but...

43:53.057 --> 43:56.116
There, that's it.
That's it, that's it.

43:57.127 --> 43:58.594
Grandma!

43:59.896 --> 44:02.160
- Can you read that?
- I don't know, but here, let's help her up.

44:02.231 --> 44:04.164
Oh...

44:07.636 --> 44:11.628
Gort, there are no matching socks here.

44:12.106 --> 44:16.371
Yes, well, uh,
I have some more in the cupboard.

44:17.010 --> 44:19.443
Well, go get them.

44:19.511 --> 44:22.275
No. Grandma, read this spell with me.

44:22.347 --> 44:24.644
No, go away.
We're busy.

44:24.715 --> 44:27.547
- She's gone.
- But, grandma, it's me - marnie.

44:27.617 --> 44:30.586
- Here we go.
- Grandma...

44:30.654 --> 44:34.180
Oh, finally we can
get something accomplished.

44:34.256 --> 44:36.656
Matching, matching.
You want the long one?

44:36.725 --> 44:38.555
Look, we have to get out of here.

44:38.626 --> 44:41.651
We can come back for her later.

44:41.728 --> 44:42.854
Ok.

44:46.699 --> 44:49.361
(Reading spell)

45:01.044 --> 45:04.172
Ok, I say we head back to the mortal world.

45:04.247 --> 45:06.908
The spell, it's coming back.

45:06.982 --> 45:09.348
Grandma, what's happening?

45:09.418 --> 45:13.080
It's the gray spell.
It's affecting me...

45:13.154 --> 45:15.747
This is only five minutes ago.

45:15.822 --> 45:18.313
Must not have said it right.

45:20.359 --> 45:22.987
(Reading spell)

45:29.433 --> 45:30.764
- Aah.
- Whoa.

45:30.834 --> 45:33.029
(Grunts)

45:33.103 --> 45:35.900
Ok, I overshot just a little bit.

45:35.972 --> 45:37.803
(Reading spell)

45:43.210 --> 45:45.735
(Marnie screams)

45:56.522 --> 45:59.581
Luke?
Grandma?

45:59.657 --> 46:02.523
Nice job of escaping my spell.

46:02.592 --> 46:04.685
You have real potential, marnie.

46:05.662 --> 46:09.597
Where's Luke and grandma?
And what time is it?

46:09.665 --> 46:14.533
They're... well, I guess you could say
I took 'em offline for the moment.

46:14.602 --> 46:16.831
It's a simple limbo spell.
I could teach it to you later.

46:16.904 --> 46:20.169
You better stop
breaking in on my spells, Cal.

46:20.240 --> 46:23.697
It's against the code of Merlin.

46:23.776 --> 46:26.573
Nobody cares about
the code of Merlin anymore, marnie.

46:26.645 --> 46:29.671
You need an update. And besides,
what do you wanna hang around

46:29.748 --> 46:32.614
a bunch of moldy
old creatures for, anyway?

46:32.683 --> 46:35.344
These creatures are my friends.

46:35.418 --> 46:37.818
Your mom's about to become
a really moldy old creature.

46:37.887 --> 46:39.751
Leave my mother alone.

46:39.821 --> 46:42.016
Oh, yeah, that reminds me... bye.

46:49.362 --> 46:51.922
(Reading spell)

47:12.081 --> 47:14.048
Luke?

47:15.050 --> 47:18.143
Luke? Luke, where...?

47:18.218 --> 47:23.086
You know, I think I liked this place
better when it was gray.

47:23.156 --> 47:24.885
Where is gort?

47:24.958 --> 47:28.859
It's almost 11:00 in the mortal world.
We've got to find him.

47:28.927 --> 47:30.588
(Door closes)

47:30.662 --> 47:33.721
Oh, yeah, I think you found him.

47:34.198 --> 47:36.290
What are you doing in my house?

47:36.366 --> 47:39.802
Um, it's ok.
Aggie sent us.

47:46.874 --> 47:49.274
Well, that doesn't make you welcome here.

47:49.344 --> 47:51.811
I hate aggie!

47:51.878 --> 47:54.506
Don't feel bad.
He hates everyone.

47:54.581 --> 47:55.945
Um...

47:56.015 --> 48:00.246
Well, aggie has
the greatest respect for you.

48:03.421 --> 48:06.287
She does?
Yeah.

48:06.357 --> 48:12.261
She said that you were
the smelliest, foulest,

48:12.328 --> 48:15.490
meanest inhabitant
in all of halloweentown.

48:15.564 --> 48:17.429
Marnie, ixnay.

48:17.499 --> 48:19.159
She said that?

48:21.168 --> 48:22.362
Ehh...

48:22.436 --> 48:24.528
She's just trying to butter me up.

48:24.604 --> 48:27.903
No, no, no.
She meant it, really.

48:27.974 --> 48:31.773
That's very sweet of her,
and I hate it when people are sweet!

48:31.844 --> 48:35.870
Now get out!
I have messing up to do.

48:35.947 --> 48:38.346
No. No, but there's
something that we need.

48:38.415 --> 48:43.351
Oh. Well, in that case, take a number.

48:43.419 --> 48:48.549
- I'm now serving nobody!
- Uh, but...

48:48.623 --> 48:53.491
Little girl, you stink like a cromwell,

48:53.560 --> 48:57.256
and I want you out of my cottage!

48:57.330 --> 49:00.959
Ok, ok.
Nice gort.

49:02.034 --> 49:03.865
(Growls)

49:06.537 --> 49:13.237
Well, um, it was nice seeing your place
while it was still messy.

49:13.309 --> 49:16.277
Wait.

49:16.345 --> 49:21.008
What do you mean, "still messy"?

49:21.082 --> 49:25.074
There's this thing called the gray spell,
you see, and in a few years,

49:25.152 --> 49:29.588
kalabar's son is gonna make
your whole house neat.

49:29.655 --> 49:31.782
What?!

49:35.126 --> 49:37.151
Aah!

49:37.228 --> 49:38.922
(Screaming)

49:41.165 --> 49:43.292
Slow down.

49:43.367 --> 49:46.130
Watch out. Aah!

49:46.202 --> 49:48.761
Are you sure mom said this was ok?

49:48.837 --> 49:51.863
No. Grandma hasn't
taught me how to fly yet.

49:51.940 --> 49:54.908
- What?
- It's ok.

49:54.975 --> 49:56.567
(Laughs)

49:56.644 --> 49:59.441
Yeow!

49:59.512 --> 50:01.980
(Screaming and moaning)

50:14.091 --> 50:18.584
- (Luke) What does it look like?
- (Marnie) It's a big leather book.

50:25.100 --> 50:28.000
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

50:28.068 --> 50:30.559
I can't let this happen.

50:30.636 --> 50:33.901
My beautiful dirt cleaned?

50:33.973 --> 50:39.467
My wonderful junk
sold in a yard sale? Oh...

50:39.544 --> 50:43.411
Don't you have some sort of,
I don't know, a filing system?

50:43.481 --> 50:45.277
Of course I do.

50:45.348 --> 50:48.647
I keep all my scabs under the porch.

50:49.352 --> 50:52.115
- Ew!
- Ugh, I'm sorry I asked.

50:52.187 --> 50:54.416
Aah!

50:54.489 --> 50:56.684
Hey, spike.

50:56.758 --> 50:58.851
My boy, my boy.

50:58.925 --> 51:00.756
Come to papa.

51:00.827 --> 51:02.089
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

51:04.230 --> 51:06.323
Yes.

51:08.366 --> 51:10.231
Ok.

51:10.301 --> 51:12.132
Go play, but you play nice.

51:12.203 --> 51:13.829
Ohh.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.304
I don't think the spell book is here.

51:16.373 --> 51:18.431
We've looked everywhere.

51:18.508 --> 51:24.241
Maybe we came too far back in time,
maybe before she even lost the spell book.

51:24.312 --> 51:26.746
Well, grandma said
she hasn't seen it for decades.

51:26.815 --> 51:28.543
We couldn't have come back that far.

51:28.616 --> 51:33.075
Hey, is this book you're looking for leather?

51:33.153 --> 51:34.177
Yes.

51:34.254 --> 51:37.654
With some kind of
fancy writing on the front?

51:37.723 --> 51:39.588
Biblio magica.
Yeah.

51:39.658 --> 51:42.285
- I remember it.
- That's really good.

51:42.360 --> 51:47.456
Kalabar bought it from me
about 50 years ago.

51:47.531 --> 51:50.329
That's really bad.

51:50.400 --> 51:55.734
Kalabar must've been working on
this world-domination thing for decades.

51:55.804 --> 52:00.240
Well, then that means Cal must've had
grandma's other spell book all along

52:00.307 --> 52:03.208
with the gray spell in it.

52:03.277 --> 52:06.006
And the only reason
he took it out of our house...

52:06.078 --> 52:08.911
Was to stop you from undoing the spell.

52:08.981 --> 52:11.175
Ugh.

52:11.349 --> 52:14.011
I can't believe it.

52:14.085 --> 52:16.644
We came all this way for nothing.

52:16.720 --> 52:18.551
Ohh...

52:23.660 --> 52:26.127
([Music] Dance)

52:34.067 --> 52:37.901
- Nice landing, Sophie.
- Like you could do better.

52:46.044 --> 52:47.977
I don't see mom.

52:48.612 --> 52:51.911
Oh, Cindy,
I found a great costume for the dance.

52:51.982 --> 52:56.315
Yeah? Who are you
supposed to be - El geeko?

53:06.693 --> 53:08.957
There she is.

53:09.028 --> 53:11.461
Mom. Hey, mom.

53:11.530 --> 53:13.088
Mommy.

53:13.165 --> 53:15.690
Sophie? Dylan?

53:15.766 --> 53:17.961
- What are you guys doing here?
- Um...

53:18.035 --> 53:21.162
Well, we're just rocking to the beat.

53:30.011 --> 53:31.410
We had to talk to you.

53:31.479 --> 53:35.437
Talk to me? About what?
How did you get here?

53:38.952 --> 53:42.682
Alex, would you excuse us
for just a minute?

53:42.755 --> 53:46.451
- Sure. I'll get some punch.
- Great.

53:46.524 --> 53:49.253
- You flew here?
- Not very well.

53:49.326 --> 53:51.453
Why would you do something like that?

53:51.528 --> 53:55.293
- Sophie wants to talk to you about Alex.
- Alex?

53:55.365 --> 53:57.356
He's not really Cal's dad, mom.

53:57.433 --> 54:00.868
Oh, I see.
He's not. And who is?

54:00.936 --> 54:04.268
Well, we kind of left that part out before
because we didn't think you'd like it.

54:04.338 --> 54:06.101
It's kalabar, mom.

54:07.674 --> 54:11.337
- Aggie told you that.
- Marnie, but grandma thinks so, too.

54:11.411 --> 54:17.370
Oh, I see, and so Alex is what,
an actor that Cal hired?

54:17.448 --> 54:19.609
Sophie has a theory.

54:19.684 --> 54:22.015
I think he's a golem.

54:22.085 --> 54:24.485
- A golem.
- Made of frogs.

54:30.726 --> 54:35.889
You know, you did undo Cal's spell once.

54:35.963 --> 54:39.558
- What do you mean?
- With me - the gray spell.

54:39.633 --> 54:42.123
No, it just wore off.

54:42.201 --> 54:44.169
It didn't wear off of Benny or gort.

54:44.237 --> 54:47.899
It had to have been
something you did or said.

54:47.973 --> 54:49.907
Like what?

54:49.975 --> 54:54.240
Well, uh, all right, you were searching
through aggie's house...

54:54.312 --> 54:57.508
Right, and you were picking your nose.

54:57.580 --> 54:59.945
And you couldn't find
the second spell book.

55:00.015 --> 55:04.042
Right, so I was trying to get
grandma to think of something else,

55:04.119 --> 55:06.586
some other way to break the spell.

55:06.654 --> 55:09.816
No, but you didn't say spell.
You said something else.

55:09.890 --> 55:11.255
So?

55:11.325 --> 55:14.521
So maybe whatever you said
undid the spell.

55:14.593 --> 55:18.029
I would've had to be talking backwards
to undo the spell.

55:18.097 --> 55:20.929
Maybe it was in there
backwards somehow.

55:22.300 --> 55:24.597
Ok. Um...

55:24.668 --> 55:27.535
I think I called it a trap. Uh...

55:27.604 --> 55:29.901
Something to get us out of this trap.

55:33.608 --> 55:35.803
All right, why don't you just say it all again?

55:35.877 --> 55:41.872
Ok, it was something like,
something to get us out of this trap.

55:41.948 --> 55:44.815
A spell or a charm.

55:44.884 --> 55:47.511
This trap.

55:48.554 --> 55:54.856
A spell... or a...

55:54.926 --> 55:57.519
You didn't say "charm," I know that.

55:57.594 --> 56:00.620
Something backwards. Uh...

56:00.697 --> 56:03.358
Trap, no.

56:03.432 --> 56:06.958
Spell or a... no.

56:07.035 --> 56:10.936
Wait, wait.
Here, trapa.

56:11.005 --> 56:13.906
- Trapa?
- Yeah, it's "apart" backwards.

56:13.974 --> 56:15.406
So?

56:15.475 --> 56:18.308
So, does every spell have to be long?

56:18.378 --> 56:20.743
No. Some spells are short.

56:20.812 --> 56:24.145
- Then say this like a spell.
- But it's one word.

56:24.216 --> 56:27.616
- Will you just try it?
- Fine.

56:34.490 --> 56:36.355
Apart.

56:38.360 --> 56:40.350
Oh, my.

56:40.428 --> 56:43.056
Oh, my.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

56:43.131 --> 56:47.897
This place is very, very messy.

56:47.967 --> 56:49.992
All right, now say it backwards.

56:50.069 --> 56:51.468
Uh...

56:51.537 --> 56:53.436
Trapa?

56:59.309 --> 57:02.835
That was awful.

57:02.912 --> 57:06.370
I wanted to... clean.

57:06.449 --> 57:08.882
- Try it again.
- Ok.

57:08.950 --> 57:10.713
Apart.

57:12.253 --> 57:15.711
- Oh, my. Oh, my.
- (Both chuckle)

57:15.790 --> 57:20.852
Does anyone have a, uh...
A dustpan perhaps?

57:20.927 --> 57:22.621
Trapa.

57:28.533 --> 57:31.399
Will you stop doing that?

57:31.468 --> 57:34.562
You were right. We figured out
how to break the gray spell,

57:34.638 --> 57:36.332
and now we can get our full powers back.

57:36.405 --> 57:38.737
How much time do we have left
before the portal closes?

57:38.808 --> 57:40.707
15 minutes.

57:40.775 --> 57:43.539
Oh, my gosh, mom doesn't
know about the creature spell.

57:43.611 --> 57:45.339
What if she's still wearing that mask?

57:45.412 --> 57:47.642
We have to get back to the present
before we can warn her.

57:47.714 --> 57:51.171
Right. Uh...

57:51.250 --> 57:54.707
Where's the time-travel spell?

57:54.786 --> 57:57.152
What do you mean?
You had it.

57:57.222 --> 58:00.588
Right, well, I put it over there on that table

58:00.658 --> 58:02.888
when I had to dig through the garbage.

58:02.960 --> 58:06.156
Oh...

58:06.229 --> 58:11.666
You shouldn't have done that.

58:11.733 --> 58:13.495
Uh...

58:13.568 --> 58:16.264
Why not?
What happened to it?

58:16.337 --> 58:19.100
It's lost.

58:19.172 --> 58:24.803
Well, that's ok, right,
because things that get lost end up here.

58:24.877 --> 58:28.539
Everything that's lost
other places ends up here.

58:28.613 --> 58:32.878
But things that are lost here go poof.

58:34.284 --> 58:36.649
- Poof?
- Poof.

58:36.719 --> 58:39.279
Gone... forever.

58:39.355 --> 58:41.720
Poof.

58:41.790 --> 58:44.816
Please tell me that you remember the spell.

58:44.893 --> 58:48.589
It was welsh.
I could barely read it.

58:48.662 --> 58:52.153
So we're stuck here?
We can't be stuck here.

58:52.232 --> 58:54.723
Ok, ok, all right.
Let me think.

58:59.471 --> 59:02.462
(Reciting spell)

59:13.749 --> 59:16.410
(Growls)

59:17.785 --> 59:18.842
Uh...

59:18.919 --> 59:20.648
No, that's not it.

59:21.221 --> 59:22.381
Excuse me.

59:22.456 --> 59:26.255
And as for you, Dylan,
I would've expected you to be more...

59:26.325 --> 59:28.918
Hey, I brought you guys some cookies.

59:29.928 --> 59:33.260
- Everything all right?
- Um, yeah, just peachy.

59:33.330 --> 59:35.821
- Where's Cal?
- Sophie?

59:35.900 --> 59:38.834
Oh, he's around here somewhere.

59:38.902 --> 59:42.837
Your daughter stood him up. I'm afraid
he's a little bit hurt, poor fella.

59:42.905 --> 59:44.532
Why did you pick that costume?

59:44.606 --> 59:47.870
Ok, guys, I think it's time
that you were running.

59:49.377 --> 59:54.006
'Cause the funny thing is, I just saw
this seventh grader dressed up as a big fly.

59:54.080 --> 59:57.446
- A fly.
- Dylan.

59:57.516 --> 01:00:00.451
A big black one with feelers and fuzzy legs.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.913
Mm.

01:00:04.989 --> 01:00:06.979
I can even show you what he looked like.

01:00:07.057 --> 01:00:09.184
Sweetheart, not here.

01:00:09.259 --> 01:00:10.692
(Buzzing)

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.492
Sophie, you know that you're not allowed
to do magic around strangers.

01:00:15.564 --> 01:00:17.031
Mommy, look.

01:00:19.634 --> 01:00:21.624
Alex?

01:00:21.702 --> 01:00:23.397
Are you all right?

01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:27.964
Oh, that's not normal.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.197
(Gulps)

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:34.671
Oh, that was very good.

01:00:35.346 --> 01:00:37.007
You're not human.

01:00:38.749 --> 01:00:40.181
Ha.

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:42.411
Nobody's perfect.

01:00:42.485 --> 01:00:48.081
You... you... you... you golem.

01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:51.115
(Recites spell)

01:00:57.997 --> 01:01:00.557
Does anybody know
where we can find a swamp?

01:01:00.633 --> 01:01:03.192
Ohh, he was so perfect.

01:01:03.268 --> 01:01:06.533
Except for the being-made-of-frogs part.

01:01:06.605 --> 01:01:11.337
I'm really sorry, you guys.
You came here to warn me, but marnie...

01:01:11.408 --> 01:01:13.375
Marnie... where is she?

01:01:13.443 --> 01:01:15.570
She was in halloweentown
last time she called.

01:01:15.645 --> 01:01:16.872
She and grandma were having trouble

01:01:16.945 --> 01:01:18.810
getting through the portal
because of Cal's spell.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.745
It's almost midnight.
How did you talk to her?

01:01:20.816 --> 01:01:22.373
The head phone.

01:01:24.652 --> 01:01:26.119
Marnie?

01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:29.883
Marnie, can you hear me?

01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:33.481
The party you are trying to reach
is currently out of this dimension.

01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:35.992
If you'd like to leave a message.
Your party will receive it

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:39.996
in approximately 400 years.

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:42.224
400 years?

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:45.699
Pooh bear thenatos 23 skidoo.

01:01:50.372 --> 01:01:52.840
Will you just stop saying that one?

01:01:52.907 --> 01:01:56.069
- I can't remember the spell.
- You have to.

01:01:56.143 --> 01:01:59.703
This is stupid.

01:01:59.779 --> 01:02:02.270
Why don't we just use my timeline?

01:02:02.348 --> 01:02:05.441
- Your what?
- My timeline.

01:02:05.517 --> 01:02:07.815
Some wizard must've lost it.

01:02:07.886 --> 01:02:11.412
- Come on, I keep it in the closet.
- Timeline?

01:02:14.557 --> 01:02:16.821
Wow, how does it work?

01:02:16.893 --> 01:02:20.384
The timelines tell us what year it is
in the mortal world.

01:02:20.462 --> 01:02:24.420
The past is one direction,
future is the other.

01:02:28.335 --> 01:02:31.202
You know, that looks just like
a Stephen Hawking description

01:02:31.271 --> 01:02:33.204
- of a non-stellar black hole.
- And your point is?

01:02:34.807 --> 01:02:38.503
Theoretically,
black holes can accelerate time.

01:02:38.576 --> 01:02:40.043
And that would help us how?

01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:45.173
Just follow the fastest-moving timeline.
Now get out of here.

01:02:45.249 --> 01:02:50.276
Gort, I'm a goblin.
Theoretically, I can't fly.

01:02:50.353 --> 01:02:53.412
Oh, yes, you can.

01:02:56.991 --> 01:02:59.926
- What's that?
- This...

01:02:59.994 --> 01:03:03.520
Is my new-and-improved broom.

01:03:03.596 --> 01:03:05.961
- Grandma gave it to me.
- Wow.

01:03:09.967 --> 01:03:12.026
Cool, huh?

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.241
Come on, get on.

01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:21.503
Could you lower it a little?

01:03:22.812 --> 01:03:25.336
Well, come on, just swing your leg over.

01:03:25.413 --> 01:03:27.404
I'm a little afraid of flying.

01:03:27.482 --> 01:03:31.508
- Oh, do you wanna stay here?
- No.

01:03:31.585 --> 01:03:33.609
Thought so.

01:03:34.787 --> 01:03:37.347
Whoa, whoa.
Just hold on a minute.

01:03:37.423 --> 01:03:39.856
Thanks, gort.
We are out of here!

01:03:39.925 --> 01:03:42.553
(Gort) Goodbye and good riddance.

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:47.459
Watch out, watch out.

01:03:49.599 --> 01:03:51.464
(Sophie) We've looked everywhere, mom.

01:03:51.534 --> 01:03:56.630
(Dylan) I didn't see that Cal guy anywhere.
Do you think he's wearing a mask?

01:03:56.705 --> 01:04:00.538
(Gwen) I don't know. You guys go
hang out over by the refreshment table.

01:04:00.608 --> 01:04:04.338
Now, if you see him, don't do anything.
Just come and get me.

01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:08.369
And whatever he's planning,
it is up to us to stop him.

01:04:08.447 --> 01:04:11.506
I'm gonna wear my mask.
He knows me.

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:48.335
"The creature spell."

01:04:49.479 --> 01:04:52.039
And so the fun begins.

01:04:54.984 --> 01:04:56.508
- Any luck?
- No.

01:04:56.585 --> 01:04:59.519
- He's here somewhere. I can feel it.
- So can I.

01:04:59.587 --> 01:05:03.420
We've gotta find him
and get the portal open before midnigh...

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:06.752
The witchin' hour.

01:05:06.827 --> 01:05:10.125
Everyone, count down with me.
Here we go. 60...

01:05:10.196 --> 01:05:11.493
Find him.

01:05:15.534 --> 01:05:17.433
We're never gonna make it.

01:05:17.501 --> 01:05:23.666
The portal closes in just a few minutes,
and we're only in the 1600s.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:27.800
Hey, I think we should try to go
into that black hole over there.

01:05:27.876 --> 01:05:29.901
57, 56...

01:05:29.978 --> 01:05:32.445
This magic spell will transform
any human you choose

01:05:32.513 --> 01:05:35.380
into the creature they pretend to be,

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:38.612
and I choose all of you.

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:41.881
47, 46, 45,

01:05:41.954 --> 01:05:44.980
44, 43, 42,

01:05:45.057 --> 01:05:47.422
41, 40, 39...

01:05:47.492 --> 01:05:51.154
(Recites spell)

01:05:51.228 --> 01:05:54.197
35, 34, 33,

01:05:54.264 --> 01:05:57.596
32, 31, 30,

01:05:57.667 --> 01:06:01.227
29, 28, 27, 26...

01:06:01.303 --> 01:06:04.931
Now... where was I?

01:06:08.409 --> 01:06:11.900
Oh, oh, oh...

01:06:13.613 --> 01:06:15.307
(Partygoers counting down)

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.871
- What is that?
- The portal.

01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:22.909
- Mommy.
- Sophie, honey, my mask won't come off.

01:06:22.987 --> 01:06:24.112
Try and pull it.

01:06:24.187 --> 01:06:27.623
By wind, by rain,
by fire, by earth,

01:06:27.691 --> 01:06:31.353
with this spell, I will avenge
their cruel jokes at our expense.

01:06:35.763 --> 01:06:40.825
And what if this black-hole theory,
let's say, doesn't work?

01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:42.925
Whoa.

01:06:43.002 --> 01:06:45.596
- (Marnie) Whoa!
- Aah!

01:06:51.976 --> 01:06:54.171
Hurry.
It's almost midnight.

01:06:56.247 --> 01:06:58.510
Grandma...

01:06:58.581 --> 01:06:59.741
You can do it.

01:07:03.485 --> 01:07:05.578
Trapa.

01:07:07.555 --> 01:07:08.579
Oh.

01:07:08.656 --> 01:07:10.589
Oh, yes.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.160
Grandma, we have to
go back to the mortal world.

01:07:17.229 --> 01:07:19.527
Yes... yes.

01:07:21.866 --> 01:07:23.766
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:07:25.536 --> 01:07:28.562
(Both) From halloweentown
depart we now,

01:07:28.639 --> 01:07:31.732
on this, the night, all hallow's Eve,

01:07:31.807 --> 01:07:34.104
back into the mortal world.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.769
Through the portal, we take our leave!

01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:40.241
No!

01:07:42.216 --> 01:07:44.115
It's closing.

01:07:44.183 --> 01:07:47.152
It can't close now, it can't!

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.710
Mama. No!

01:07:49.788 --> 01:07:52.256
- Pull from the top.
- I'm trying.

01:07:53.124 --> 01:07:54.591
Mom!

01:07:54.725 --> 01:07:59.058
3, 2, 1!

01:08:06.302 --> 01:08:08.360
- Oh.
- (Luke) It's too late.

01:08:08.436 --> 01:08:11.836
Oh, yeah.
Ok, ok, everyone.

01:08:11.905 --> 01:08:14.806
Now, before we tell the winners
of the costume contest,

01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:16.808
it's time for the great unmasking...

01:08:16.876 --> 01:08:19.674
Change them into the creature
whose disguise they have taken.

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:24.175
(Yells spell)

01:08:28.085 --> 01:08:30.314
(Screams)

01:08:32.889 --> 01:08:35.084
(Girl) I can't breathe!

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:38.587
What's going on?

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.126
Where's my other eye?

01:08:44.165 --> 01:08:46.256
Mom...

01:08:52.738 --> 01:08:54.636
Marnie, where are you?

01:08:54.706 --> 01:08:56.298
(Screams)

01:09:01.111 --> 01:09:02.669
This can't be happening.

01:09:04.145 --> 01:09:06.671
That's weird.
My teeth won't come out.

01:09:08.383 --> 01:09:11.408
- I'm really thirsty.
- Cindy.

01:09:11.486 --> 01:09:13.680
Uh... uh...

01:09:13.754 --> 01:09:16.689
Cindy, stop it.

01:09:16.756 --> 01:09:18.587
Help me.

01:09:30.134 --> 01:09:32.124
I can't believe it.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:34.033
The portal's closed.

01:09:34.104 --> 01:09:38.631
We're gonna be stuck here
for a year of mortal-world time.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:43.939
I suppose it'll give us time to train you,
as we planned to do.

01:09:44.011 --> 01:09:49.210
And then, when the portal opens again,
we'll be ready to fight Cal.

01:09:50.517 --> 01:09:54.452
Just wait for a year of mortal time?

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.147
It's gonna feel like a century here.

01:09:57.922 --> 01:10:01.652
- Whatever.
- No, not whatever.

01:10:04.361 --> 01:10:06.851
It's all my fault.

01:10:06.929 --> 01:10:11.763
It's all my fault mom's been
turned into this horrible creature.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:15.268
There's gotta be something we can do.

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:21.171
Marnie, I love them, too,
but I can't change the rules.

01:10:23.076 --> 01:10:26.670
Then maybe we can.

01:10:26.745 --> 01:10:29.713
What... what are you doing?

01:10:29.781 --> 01:10:31.578
Calling Sophie.

01:10:31.649 --> 01:10:34.446
Sophie.
Soph, are you there?

01:10:34.518 --> 01:10:36.509
(Monsters yelling and growling)

01:10:38.654 --> 01:10:40.519
Marnie, is that you?

01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:45.687
Sophie, listen to me.
We're gonna open the portal.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.250
We can't.
It's after midnight.

01:10:48.328 --> 01:10:51.786
I don't care.
That's not gonna stop me.

01:10:52.799 --> 01:10:55.165
The portal hasn't always been there.

01:10:55.234 --> 01:11:00.170
It was created by magic, and nobody's
magic is stronger than ours, right?

01:11:01.073 --> 01:11:05.566
- I guess so.
- No. You've got to believe it.

01:11:05.643 --> 01:11:08.042
And Dylan has to, too.

01:11:09.446 --> 01:11:12.812
Come on.
What do you say?

01:11:12.881 --> 01:11:16.782
Ok, but how do we do it?
There's no spell for this.

01:11:16.851 --> 01:11:19.319
We'll just have to make up our own.

01:11:20.554 --> 01:11:23.216
- Are you ready?
- What am I supposed to do?

01:11:24.391 --> 01:11:27.416
Stop thinking about it, Dylan.
Just feel it.

01:11:36.567 --> 01:11:39.364
Hey, I'm no warlock.

01:11:40.203 --> 01:11:45.162
I need somebody who believes that
anything is possible. Do you believe that?

01:11:49.543 --> 01:11:52.637
If you're there, yeah.

01:11:55.215 --> 01:11:56.739
Grandma.

01:11:58.118 --> 01:12:03.816
I'm not sure how this'll work out,
but I've always believed in you.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.526
We call on the dreams
of creature and mortal,

01:12:13.596 --> 01:12:16.724
to heal the wound that worlds divide.

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:23.361
From now on, we each can create a portal,
and each of us our own path decide.

01:12:24.304 --> 01:12:27.932
We call on the dreams
of creature and mortal,

01:12:28.007 --> 01:12:31.033
to heal the wound that worlds divide.

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:37.809
From now on, we each can create a portal,
and each of us our own path decide.

01:12:40.484 --> 01:12:44.715
- What is that?
- Something's happening.

01:12:49.658 --> 01:12:53.388
I can't believe it.
She's trying to open the portal.

01:12:59.498 --> 01:13:03.229
We call on the dreams
of creature and mortal,

01:13:03.302 --> 01:13:06.065
to heal the wound that worlds divide.

01:13:06.137 --> 01:13:09.628
From now on, we each can create a portal,

01:13:09.706 --> 01:13:13.574
and each of us our own path decide.

01:13:27.655 --> 01:13:29.588
- Yes.
- Marnie!

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.592
- We did it.
- Oh, look, there's Sophie.

01:13:34.993 --> 01:13:37.984
No. It's impossible!

01:13:40.765 --> 01:13:43.858
- Yes. Good job.
- That's him.

01:13:44.634 --> 01:13:45.658
(Gasps)

01:13:55.543 --> 01:14:00.741
I don't care how strong you think you are,
but you could never beat me.

01:14:01.514 --> 01:14:05.450
Your only power
was the power to keep us apart, Cal.

01:14:05.517 --> 01:14:08.281
And now you don't have
that power anymore.

01:14:11.388 --> 01:14:14.050
We don't have to hate each other.

01:14:15.024 --> 01:14:18.221
Just give me back aggie's spell books.

01:14:19.995 --> 01:14:23.522
Dad was right.
You're the enemy, and you always will be.

01:14:24.099 --> 01:14:26.566
You told me you make your own decisions.

01:14:26.634 --> 01:14:29.329
Don't let your father's hate
decide for you now.

01:14:29.402 --> 01:14:30.391
Go ahead.

01:14:34.306 --> 01:14:37.833
Take the books.
I'd like to watch.

01:14:41.145 --> 01:14:44.739
Is good stronger than evil?
Let's find out.

01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:53.611
I'm not afraid of you.
I may feel sorry for you,

01:14:53.688 --> 01:14:58.784
and I'd like to help you,
but I'm not afraid of you.

01:15:07.266 --> 01:15:09.393
Marnie, be careful.

01:15:42.494 --> 01:15:44.485
Aah!

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.771
He'll be back.

01:16:00.841 --> 01:16:03.638
And we'll be waiting... together.

01:16:06.279 --> 01:16:10.339
- Grandma, will you do the honors?
- Of course, dear.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.909
Oh, Luke.

01:16:17.121 --> 01:16:20.385
(Reading spell backwards)

01:16:38.805 --> 01:16:44.333
Wow, I just had the weirdest dream.
Was I asleep?

01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:51.305
Well, I don't know who put this all together,

01:16:51.381 --> 01:16:56.147
but let's have a big hand
for the best Halloween party ever, huh?!

01:16:56.218 --> 01:16:58.846
Huh? Yeah.

01:17:00.388 --> 01:17:01.980
Whoo.

01:17:05.258 --> 01:17:06.589
Yeah.

01:17:10.896 --> 01:17:11.988
Mom.

01:17:12.631 --> 01:17:14.894
You're ok.

01:17:17.936 --> 01:17:18.924
Mother.

01:17:20.738 --> 01:17:23.934
I don't know if I'll ever
stop you guys from fighting,

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:28.034
but at least you won't have to
fight over me anymore.

01:17:28.111 --> 01:17:32.774
I know you both have things to teach me,
and now I don't have to choose.

01:17:33.247 --> 01:17:35.875
I'm not sure what I'm going to teach you.

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:38.816
It seems marnie already
knows more than I do.

01:17:38.885 --> 01:17:42.116
We better go back to halloweentown
and get rid of the gray spell.

01:17:42.188 --> 01:17:47.351
- Quite right. You coming?
- I don't think so, mom.

01:17:47.425 --> 01:17:49.416
This is my world.

01:17:49.494 --> 01:17:52.428
But I guess the kids can come and visit
you any time they want

01:17:52.496 --> 01:17:54.987
now that they've figured out
their way around the rules.

01:17:55.065 --> 01:17:57.931
Then you can expect me for dinner
next Halloween.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.060
- You be good, sweetheart.
- Oh, you too, mom.

01:18:01.137 --> 01:18:03.161
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:18:05.273 --> 01:18:06.534
All right, come on.
Let's get you out of here

01:18:06.607 --> 01:18:08.598
before somebody gives you
the prize for best mask.

01:18:08.675 --> 01:18:10.869
- Ya think?
- Yeah. You, too.

01:18:18.583 --> 01:18:20.277
Trapa.

01:18:21.886 --> 01:18:23.410
Trapa.

01:18:28.558 --> 01:18:30.252
Trapa.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.458
Trapa. Trapa.

01:18:33.529 --> 01:18:34.859
Trapa.

01:18:34.929 --> 01:18:36.829
- Just try it.
- He's busy.

01:18:36.898 --> 01:18:40.697
I've got your receipt... right here.

01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:43.367
Trapa.

01:18:45.037 --> 01:18:49.132
Wow, talk about going on
a crash diet. Ha-ha.

01:18:58.781 --> 01:19:00.976
(Cheers and applause)

01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:03.108
- Yay!
- Yes.

01:19:07.721 --> 01:19:10.417
What's everybody so happy about?

01:19:11.959 --> 01:19:15.257
- Hey, she did it. She changed it back.
- Yeah, check it out.

01:19:15.328 --> 01:19:22.095
So this world wide web I've heard about -
does it involve spiders?

01:19:22.834 --> 01:19:26.894
Grandma... I think it's time
maybe we started your training.

01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:29.871
- Ooh, I'd like that.
- Yeah.

01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:31.930
I'd like that.

01:19:46.018 --> 01:19:50.317
[Music] Under a cloak of black
and a pointed witch's hat

01:19:50.388 --> 01:19:54.381
[music] I saw a face that made
a chill run down my spine

01:19:54.459 --> 01:20:01.021
[music] When she looked me in the eye.
She must have hypnotized me

01:20:01.097 --> 01:20:06.728
[music] 'Cause the next thing I remember
I was there. Standing in her lair

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:08.792
[music] Watching as she stirred

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:12.465
[music] And then she looked at me.
And she said these words

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.370
[music] Eye of newt and wing of bat

01:20:14.441 --> 01:20:16.739
[music] And a long black whisker
from a big black cat

01:20:16.810 --> 01:20:21.109
[music] Spider legs and wolfhound fur.
Bring it to a boil and begin to stir

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:23.204
[music] Add poison Ivy with a hemlock root

01:20:23.281 --> 01:20:25.613
[music] And a thread from
the collar of a vampire suit

01:20:25.683 --> 01:20:27.707
[music] Guaranteed with your money back. Too

01:20:27.784 --> 01:20:31.481
[music] But be careful when
you mess with witch's brew
