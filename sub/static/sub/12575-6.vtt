<i>How did the big shampooing final go?</i>

00:42.107 --> 00:44.735
Well, I passed Lather, but I failed Rinse.

00:45.043 --> 00:48.604
And then I failed Repeat, too,
because it includes Rinse...

00:48.914 --> 00:51.405
which I don't think is very fair.

00:52.217 --> 00:53.514
HANK: [Muttering] Damn.

00:54.319 --> 00:56.947
Hank, you forgot to flush.

00:57.222 --> 00:59.486
Didn't have to. Didn't do anything.

00:59.891 --> 01:00.880
Oh.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.422
I see.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.391
How long has this been going on?

01:05.464 --> 01:07.864
There's nothing going on, Peg.

01:08.266 --> 01:11.429
- That's the problem.
- How long have you had this problem?

01:11.503 --> 01:13.403
HANK: There is no problem! Please!

01:13.538 --> 01:16.439
This is not something

- Here.
- What's this?

01:41.299 --> 01:43.824
It's Megamucil.
I take 10 heaping teaspoons...

01:43.902 --> 01:46.132
and a glass of water daily to stay regular...

01:46.204 --> 01:47.637

This is my own private,

01:56.882 --> 01:59.544
At least drink the water.
If you drink enough water...

01:59.618 --> 02:01.950

That looks good.
Peggy, where's my breakfast?

02:12.130 --> 02:15.293
- What are these?
- I baked muffins.

02:15.734 --> 02:18.225
<i>So? Good for you. Where's my sausage?</i>

02:18.303 --> 02:20.362
Well, we're out of sausage.

That's ridiculous!

Anyway, that's not something
you should ever know about your father.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.286
It's pretty obvious.

02:45.363 --> 02:47.729
You were in the bathroom

02:47.799 --> 02:49.027
No, I wasn't!

Nancy, I'm worried about Hank.

03:11.389 --> 03:15.052
He hasn't "done his business" in four days.

03:15.961 --> 03:18.361
Good Lord! Poor Hank.

03:18.930 --> 03:20.693
<i>He looks so healthy.</i>

But then, you know, so did Elvis Presley.

03:23.502 --> 03:26.266
Nancy, you don't think
it's something serious?

03:26.338 --> 03:29.899
Well, I'm a meteorologist, not a doctor.

03:30.075 --> 03:32.771
But if I had to make an educated guess...

03:33.311 --> 03:35.176
I'd say he's got polio.

03:35.747 --> 03:39.376
All right, I'm not a meteorologist.
I'm a weather girl.

03:39.518 --> 03:42.851
<i>So, Hank, what's this I hear
about you being backed up?</i>

03:43.021 --> 03:44.386
Nothing! What?

03:44.456 --> 03:48.324
Who are you thinking about talking to?
It's not me. I'm fine!

03:48.460 --> 03:50.189
Well, that's not what I heard.

03:50.262 --> 03:52.127
- Heard from who?
- Dale.

03:52.197 --> 03:54.290
- How does Dale know?
- Nancy.

03:54.366 --> 03:56.231
Nancy knows, too?

03:57.202 --> 03:58.499
That Peggy.

03:58.570 --> 04:02.131
Why not just take the door off
the bathroom and put it out on the lawn?

04:02.207 --> 04:05.267
Hank, it happens to everyone
now and then.

04:05.343 --> 04:07.743
There's no reason to be embarrassed.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.440
Maybe I'm not the one
who should be embarrassed.

04:10.515 --> 04:12.039
Did you ever think of that?

04:12.117 --> 04:14.608
Maybe you're going a little too much.

04:14.686 --> 04:18.452
Once every four or five days
gives me more free time.

04:18.890 --> 04:22.451
You want to spend all your time
on the toilet, be my guest.

04:22.527 --> 04:24.154
DALE: Have you tried squatting?

04:24.362 --> 04:26.830
It takes pressure off the lower body.

I find a ride on the lawnmower helps.

04:30.802 --> 04:33.669
Would you please stop talking about this?

04:34.539 --> 04:36.734
[Muttering] I've been thinking about y'all...

Y'all ought to jog,
swim, or water something.

you pooping just like before.

It's better to talk things out.

Five days, and Hank's usual schedule

Of course when we were first married,
he'd go every day.

Mr. Hill?

12:13.531 --> 12:16.125
<i>Mr. Hill, this is Tasha.
She's a medical student.</i>

12:16.267 --> 12:19.327
Would it be all right with you
if she observes the examination?

12:19.737 --> 12:21.227
Well, I guess.

12:39.657 --> 12:42.683
Mr. Hill, this is a special camera...

12:42.760 --> 12:45.854
that we use to get
an inside view of your colon.

12:46.197 --> 12:47.824
HANK: Just kill me now.

12:48.032 --> 12:50.227
Mr. Hill, do you wish a bite plate?

12:50.301 --> 12:51.893
Mom, I'm hungry.

12:52.036 --> 12:53.025

12:55.406 --> 12:57.033
Bobby, get out of here!

12:57.141 --> 13:01.475
No, Mr. Hill, when a family faces
an illness, all members should be involved.

13:01.546 --> 13:04.140
Remember, they're your get-well team.

13:04.248 --> 13:07.149
- Hey there, ace. Do you like video games?
- Yeah!

13:07.218 --> 13:09.982
Well, this joystick
is just like a video game joystick.

13:10.054 --> 13:12.386
<i>Only my red button fires a real laser.</i>

13:12.457 --> 13:13.549

<i>Say, you're good.
Maybe you could help us out a little later.</i>

13:21.833 --> 13:23.698
Just kidding, Mr. Hill.

13:23.768 --> 13:26.202
Mr. Hill, it doesn't hurt to smile.

13:26.571 --> 13:28.198
It might actually help.

13:28.806 --> 13:30.603
Tasha, you can begin.

13:34.412 --> 13:36.039
<i>DOCTOR: So far this looks normal.</i>

13:36.114 --> 13:37.513
Normal?

13:37.782 --> 13:39.113
That's good, right?

13:39.183 --> 13:40.514
Now, this is exciting.

13:40.585 --> 13:42.450
There are so many twists and turns.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.750
I can't wait to see
what's around the next bend.

13:44.822 --> 13:48.087
The colon has to twist and turn
because it's surprisingly long.

13:48.159 --> 13:51.651
You know, Bobby, if I were
to take your grandfather's intestine...

13:51.729 --> 13:52.821
I'm his father.

13:52.897 --> 13:55.798
Your father's intestine
and lay it out in a straight line...

13:55.867 --> 13:58.529
it would go all the way around the earth.

13:58.603 --> 14:00.195
Wow! Really?

14:00.972 --> 14:04.635
Well, that is amazing, Doctor.
You know, I did not know that.

14:04.709 --> 14:06.108
Now, how could that be?

14:06.177 --> 14:09.408
The Earth is 25,000 miles around.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.506
A piece of steak would have
to shoot through your system...

14:12.583 --> 14:15.575
faster than the speed of sound.
That's impossible.

14:15.653 --> 14:20.522
Well, Mr. Hill, there's certainly nothing
going through your intestines that fast.

14:20.858 --> 14:23.618
Hey, I like this.
Can I be a proctologist when I grow up?

14:23.628 --> 14:24.617
Hey, I like this.
Can I be a proctologist when I grow up?

[Machine buzzing]

14:26.063 --> 14:30.466

14:37.908 --> 14:40.536
- How are you holding up, Mrs. Hill?
- I'm okay.

14:40.811 --> 14:44.247
I'm just a little uncomfortable
from sitting here for so long.

14:45.316 --> 14:46.340
[Doctor sighing]

14:46.417 --> 14:48.817
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take
a five-minute break.

14:54.025 --> 14:57.859
Well, Mr. Hill, we're not exactly sure
what's causing your problem.

14:57.928 --> 15:01.921
<i>So at this point, the best option might be
to remove something surgically.</i>

15:02.099 --> 15:05.626
I'm sorry. But apparently your low-fat,
high-fiber diet is not working.

15:05.703 --> 15:08.194
Well, maybe Hank just needs
to give his low-fat...

15:08.272 --> 15:10.206
high-fiber diet a little more time.

15:10.274 --> 15:13.437
- Isn't that right, Hank?
- Yes. All right.

15:13.944 --> 15:17.243
Just to be safe, I'll book an operating
room for the end of the week.

15:17.314 --> 15:18.713
Oh, God!

15:18.816 --> 15:22.183
DOCTOR: Don't worry. You know,
it's possible to live a long, healthy...

15:22.253 --> 15:24.813
slightly less active life without a colon.

15:33.330 --> 15:36.163
"Not Dogs." Now what are these?
Hot dogs?

15:36.233 --> 15:38.326
No. They're Not Dogs.

15:38.769 --> 15:40.100
They're made of tofu.

15:40.171 --> 15:42.105
Tofu? I can't eat that crap.

15:42.173 --> 15:44.107
Then try this Faux Fu.

15:44.175 --> 15:46.973
<i>It's a tofu substitute
for the tofu-intolerant.</i>

15:47.478 --> 15:49.969
Now would that be good
for a man who's constipated?

15:50.047 --> 15:52.072
- Peggy!
- Well, I didn't say it was you.

15:52.149 --> 15:53.673
Is this for your husband?

15:53.751 --> 15:56.982
Yes, and we will also take a quart
of your brown rice broth.

15:57.054 --> 15:59.545
Do you have anything that tastes good?

PEGGY: Oh, I'm sorry, Dale.

I thought it would help cheer Hank up
to have all of his friends here.

I think he's making a lot of progress.

17:36.220 --> 17:39.087
PEGGY: Where are you going, Hank?
HANK: To the bathroom.

17:39.190 --> 17:43.024
Now just try to relax, Hank.
And concentrate. This could be it.

That's not Hank. That's me.

Now, as an actor, I only do nudity
