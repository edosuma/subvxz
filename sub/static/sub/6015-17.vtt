WEBVTT

00:02.369 --> 00:03.687
I never really understood...

00:05.169 --> 00:06.841
...the importance of the conductor.

00:07.009 --> 00:10.604
Between you and me,
what the hell is this guy doing?

00:10.769 --> 00:14.557
Do you really need somebody
waving a stick in your face...

00:14.729 --> 00:17.766
...to play the violin?
Does that really help you out?

00:18.249 --> 00:21.047
I could see how we need him
at the beginning, okay?

00:21.249 --> 00:22.648
Tap, tap, tap.

00:22.929 --> 00:25.807
"Start." Okay.
I could see how you need that.

00:25.969 --> 00:29.166
But once we're going, okay.
Once it's all happening...

00:29.329 --> 00:30.967
...what do we need him for then?

00:31.129 --> 00:35.998
I don't see the cellist looking up,
"I'm confused. I don't know what to do."

00:36.169 --> 00:39.047
And the conductor goes,
"Do this. Like this..."

00:39.209 --> 00:41.803
"Oh, okay, thank you.
Thank you very much."

00:46.929 --> 00:48.840
Why try anymore?
There's no sense to it.

00:49.009 --> 00:50.965
I'll never meet anybody.
I should accept it.

00:51.129 --> 00:53.245
- Oh, yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

00:53.489 --> 00:55.719
Yeah, maybe you won't.

00:56.049 --> 00:59.837
It's hard enough to meet a woman
you dislike, much less like.

01:01.889 --> 01:03.845
- Are my nostrils getting bigger?
- No.

01:04.009 --> 01:07.922
See, why must it be so difficult?
Why all this tension and hostility?

01:08.089 --> 01:12.048
Why can't I just walk up to a woman
and say, " Hi, I'm George.

01:12.209 --> 01:14.120
How are you?" Is that so terrible?

01:14.489 --> 01:16.241
H... H... Hi.

01:16.769 --> 01:18.600
Hi. Hi.

01:21.889 --> 01:23.720
- There's no men out there.
- I know.

01:23.889 --> 01:27.598
The problem is that the good ones
know they're good.

01:27.769 --> 01:29.043
They know they're in demand.

01:29.209 --> 01:32.326
They're not interested in confining
themselves to one person.

01:32.489 --> 01:34.719
I hate the good ones.

01:34.889 --> 01:36.038
Is Jerry a good one?

01:36.209 --> 01:39.121
That's a good question.
I think he thinks he is.

01:40.689 --> 01:42.361
The mediocre ones are available...

01:42.529 --> 01:44.406
...but so insecure
about not being a good one...

01:44.569 --> 01:46.605
...that they always go,
"I'm not good enough for you.

01:46.769 --> 01:51.240
What are you doing with me?"
Eventually I just go, "You're right."

01:53.249 --> 01:55.717
Maybe you need somebody
between good and mediocre.

01:55.889 --> 01:57.686
No, maybe I need somebody
who has nothing.

01:57.849 --> 02:01.762
Somebody who just appreciates being
with me because he's so desperate.

02:05.449 --> 02:08.600
It's gotten to the point where I'm
flirting with operators on the phone.

02:10.249 --> 02:12.444
I almost made a date with one.

02:12.609 --> 02:14.042
Oh, so there's still hope.

02:14.289 --> 02:17.520
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me.

02:18.129 --> 02:20.563
My dream is to become hopeless.

02:20.729 --> 02:21.923
The hopeless don't care.

02:22.089 --> 02:24.762
When you don't care,
that indifference makes you attractive.

02:25.489 --> 02:28.686
- So hopelessness is the key.
- It's my only hope.

02:29.169 --> 02:31.524
You see, I wouldn't really mind
so much...

02:31.689 --> 02:33.247
...but I feel badly for my mother.

02:33.409 --> 02:35.843
If my mother weren't around,
it wouldn't be so bad.

02:36.009 --> 02:39.922
But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married
by the time I'm 40, I'll have to kill her.

02:40.129 --> 02:43.201
Because it's the only fair thing to do.

02:43.929 --> 02:45.726
I just couldn't put her through that.

02:47.089 --> 02:48.727
At least you're not bitter.

02:49.969 --> 02:51.368
Who says I'm not bitter?

02:51.529 --> 02:54.601
- Aren't you too young to be bitter?
- No, you can be young and bitter.

02:55.369 --> 02:58.805
Just maybe not as bitter as I'll be
10 years from now.

02:59.249 --> 03:01.001
But I'm bitter.

03:01.409 --> 03:04.048
Anyway, don't tell anyone.

03:05.209 --> 03:08.121
Don't worry. Your bitterness
is safe with me.

03:08.649 --> 03:11.561
Okay. Order me a piece of cake.

03:11.929 --> 03:13.601
I'm gonna go throw up.

03:20.209 --> 03:21.403
Look at my hands.

03:21.649 --> 03:22.968
Look.

03:23.809 --> 03:25.162
Filthy from the paper.

03:25.569 --> 03:29.323
They should give you a Wet-Nap when
you buy one, like at those rib joints.

03:30.609 --> 03:33.123
- What did you do last night?
- Went out with George. You?

03:33.289 --> 03:34.927
Went out with Cynthia.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.443
What did you talk about?

03:36.649 --> 03:40.642
Oh, you know, the usual.
The Federal Reserve, the rain forest.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.280
Cynthia felt we should nuke
the rain forest.

03:45.449 --> 03:48.441
Get rid of it in one fell swoop
so we could eliminate it...

03:48.609 --> 03:50.486
...as a subject of conversation.

03:51.569 --> 03:54.163
- What about you?
- We brushed on that.

03:56.449 --> 03:59.088
Actually, George was in rare form.

03:59.249 --> 04:01.558
He just can't find anybody.

04:01.729 --> 04:03.242
I know. Cynthia too.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.798
- She's really given up.
- George too.

04:11.049 --> 04:13.358
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.

04:15.969 --> 04:18.721
- I've never fixed anybody up.
- Me neither.

04:18.889 --> 04:22.279
And I am not about to
start with George.

04:24.729 --> 04:27.243
Well, why wouldn't you start
with George?

04:27.409 --> 04:28.967
You think she's too good for George?

04:29.249 --> 04:31.001
I didn't say "too good," did I?

04:31.169 --> 04:33.319
- You implied it.
- I didn't say it.

04:33.489 --> 04:35.241
If you think she's too good
for George...

04:35.409 --> 04:38.287
...you are dead wrong. Dead wrong.

04:39.569 --> 04:41.082
Who is she?

04:41.329 --> 04:43.559
- Who is he?
- He's George.

04:44.049 --> 04:46.279
- She's Cynthia.
- So what?

04:47.369 --> 04:49.519
What, you don't think
she's beautiful?

04:50.089 --> 04:51.841
What's with the eyebrows?

04:54.089 --> 04:56.842
You know what your problem is?
Your standards are too high.

04:57.049 --> 04:58.562
I went out with you.

05:03.089 --> 05:06.047
That's because my standards
are too low.

05:08.849 --> 05:12.319
And by the way,
women kill for eyebrows like that.

05:12.489 --> 05:16.368
Do you know that?
Women pluck their real eyebrows...

05:16.529 --> 05:19.407
...out of their head one by one...

05:19.569 --> 05:22.925
...until they're bald, Jerry,
bald above the eyes.

05:23.089 --> 05:26.286
And then they paint in these eyebrows
to look like that.

05:26.449 --> 05:28.644
Well, let me tell you something
about George.

05:28.809 --> 05:30.765
He is fast.

05:31.049 --> 05:33.279
He can run like the wind.

05:33.529 --> 05:34.757
And he's strong.

05:34.929 --> 05:37.887
I've seen him lift 100 pounds over
his head without even knowing it.

05:38.329 --> 05:41.321
You wouldn't know it to look at him,
but George can bait a hook.

05:41.649 --> 05:43.799
- He can really do that?
- Come on, let's do it.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.561
I think they'll really get along.

05:45.729 --> 05:49.404
- What, are you into this?
- Yeah, come on, it's a good match.

05:49.569 --> 05:52.322
Wait. They'll be telling us how
their dates went.

05:52.489 --> 05:54.047
Are we gonna share
that information?

05:54.209 --> 05:55.562
Naturally.

05:57.169 --> 06:00.718
We're going to tell each other
everything? Every secret?

06:01.009 --> 06:02.203
Everything.

06:03.009 --> 06:05.603
- What if it worked out?
- Yeah, right

06:08.609 --> 06:10.361
Out of the question.

06:10.609 --> 06:12.042
Out of the question.

06:12.329 --> 06:15.401
- Why?
- No. I'm not going to do that.

06:15.649 --> 06:18.243
It's one step away from personal ads.

06:18.929 --> 06:20.362
Then prostitutes.

06:20.529 --> 06:23.885
No! No! I am not going
down that road.

06:29.209 --> 06:31.086
What does she look like?

06:32.369 --> 06:33.961
- She's good-looking.
- How good-looking?

06:34.129 --> 06:35.881
- Very good-looking.
- Really good-looking?

06:36.049 --> 06:38.404
- Really very good-looking.
- Would you take her out?

06:38.809 --> 06:40.367
- Yes, I would.
- You hesitated.

06:40.529 --> 06:44.124
- What hesitate? I didn't hesitate.
- Something's up. You hesitated.

06:44.289 --> 06:46.439
I'm telling you, she's good-looking.

06:47.289 --> 06:49.519
- What about the body?
- Good body. Nice body.

06:49.689 --> 06:51.645
- How nice?
- Nice. Pretty nice.

06:51.849 --> 06:55.080
- Really good?
- Really very nice and good.

07:00.569 --> 07:03.037
- What about personality?
- Good personality.

07:05.329 --> 07:07.081
Funny. Bright.

07:07.249 --> 07:09.126
I don't want anyone smarter than me.

07:09.289 --> 07:12.122
How could she be smarter than you?

07:15.089 --> 07:18.081
All right, let's see. Let's see.
What else? What else?

07:18.369 --> 07:20.087
What does she do?

07:20.489 --> 07:22.241
First of all, what does he do?

07:22.409 --> 07:24.047
He was in real estate.

07:24.209 --> 07:26.439
He's not working right now.

07:26.609 --> 07:29.123
Oh! He's not working?
No. No. No.

07:29.289 --> 07:31.041
How come he's not working?

07:31.209 --> 07:33.962
Well, I mean, he got fired.

07:34.129 --> 07:35.323
Why did he get fired?

07:39.609 --> 07:43.238
Oh, right. Well...

07:43.409 --> 07:46.446
He tried to... poison his boss.

07:46.609 --> 07:48.281
Excuse me?

07:48.849 --> 07:53.559
It's such a long story. Seriously,
he just had some problems at work.

07:53.729 --> 07:55.685
- Is he nuts?
- No, no, no.

07:55.849 --> 07:59.000
He's a really, really funny guy.

07:59.249 --> 08:00.523
What does he look like?

08:01.049 --> 08:03.722
- Pardon?
- What does he look like?

08:05.009 --> 08:07.477
Well, he's got a lot of character
in his face.

08:07.649 --> 08:11.085
He's short. He's stocky.

08:11.249 --> 08:12.443
He's fat.

08:12.609 --> 08:14.327
Is that what you're saying,
that he's fat?

08:14.609 --> 08:15.758
Powerful.

08:15.929 --> 08:21.606
He is so powerful. He can lift
100 pounds right up over his head.

08:21.849 --> 08:24.204
And, what else? What else?

08:24.369 --> 08:26.758
Oh, right, well...

08:26.929 --> 08:31.207
He's, he's kind of...
Just kind of... Losing his hair.

08:31.449 --> 08:34.168
- He's bald?
- No.

08:34.409 --> 08:37.321
No, no, no. He's not bald.

08:37.489 --> 08:39.241
He's balding.

08:39.529 --> 08:42.441
- So he will be bald?
- Yeah.

08:42.849 --> 08:45.966
- What kind of hair?
- You know, long, dark hair.

08:46.129 --> 08:47.528
Flowing?

08:48.729 --> 08:49.923
Flowing?

08:50.329 --> 08:54.208
Is it flowing? I like flowing,
cascading hair.

08:54.449 --> 08:57.680
Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me.

09:03.569 --> 09:05.321
"Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me."

09:05.489 --> 09:06.842
- Is that what you said?
- Right.

09:07.009 --> 09:08.567
Just clarifying.

09:09.729 --> 09:11.765
Let me ask you this.

09:16.049 --> 09:20.088
If you stick your hand in the hair,
is it easy to get it out?

09:23.569 --> 09:24.888
Do you want to get it out?

09:25.049 --> 09:27.404
Or do you want to not be able
to get it out?

09:28.169 --> 09:30.922
- I'd like to be able to get it out.
- I think you'll get it out.

09:31.849 --> 09:33.202
What about the skin?

09:33.369 --> 09:35.485
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.

09:36.249 --> 09:38.001
She's got a fine cheek.

09:38.249 --> 09:39.728
Is there a pinkish hue?

09:42.609 --> 09:46.648
- A pinkish hue?
- Yes, a rosy glow.

09:47.209 --> 09:49.120
There's a hue.

09:49.929 --> 09:53.319
She's got great eyebrows.
Women kill to have her eyebrows.

09:55.209 --> 09:56.927
Who cares about eyebrows?

09:59.809 --> 10:02.118
Is she sweet? I like sweet.

10:02.529 --> 10:05.123
But not too sweet.
You could throw up from that.

10:08.409 --> 10:10.445
I don't think you'll throw up.

10:11.729 --> 10:13.924
She likes to throw up.

10:20.209 --> 10:22.518
- Has he ever been married?
- No.

10:23.329 --> 10:24.967
Has he been close?

10:25.489 --> 10:28.367
He once spent a weekend
with a woman.

10:31.729 --> 10:34.197
He didn't really try
to poison his boss.

10:34.489 --> 10:36.127
Yeah, he did.

10:40.489 --> 10:42.525
We had an incredible
phone conversation.

10:42.689 --> 10:44.327
We talked for, like, 20 minutes.

10:44.489 --> 10:47.242
I threw away my notes
in the middle of the call.

10:49.809 --> 10:51.959
I thought she had
a great voice timbre.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.482
Is it "timbre" or "tambre"?

10:53.649 --> 10:56.607
- I think it's tambre.
- Why'd I think timbre?

10:56.769 --> 10:58.202
She could do voice-overs.

10:58.369 --> 10:59.882
You didn't tell me about her voice?

11:00.049 --> 11:02.927
- I didn't notice the voice.
- It's mellifluous.

11:04.049 --> 11:05.562
So, Saturday night.

11:05.729 --> 11:07.879
She had to be impressed
by that conversation.

11:08.049 --> 11:10.802
It was a great performance.
I am unbelievable on the phone.

11:10.969 --> 11:15.485
On the date, they should just have two
phones on the table at the restaurant.

11:16.369 --> 11:18.007
- Hi.
- Hi!

11:18.929 --> 11:22.046
- Out we go Saturday night.
- I know.

11:22.209 --> 11:26.248
- So, what did she say?
- You're getting together Saturday night.

11:27.809 --> 11:29.800
- That's it?
- Yeah.

11:30.089 --> 11:33.286
- She didn't mention the conversation?
- No.

11:35.209 --> 11:37.120
See? I don't get that.

11:37.889 --> 11:41.040
We had a relaxed, stimulating, great
conversation. She doesn't mention it?

11:41.209 --> 11:42.403
- Why not mention it?
- What?

11:42.569 --> 11:44.082
She could have mentioned it.

11:44.249 --> 11:47.400
All right. All right. I'll go on the date,
but that's that.

11:52.689 --> 11:54.600
You know my friend Bob Sacamano?

11:54.769 --> 11:58.921
- The guy from Jersey.
- He just got a job at a condom factory.

12:00.049 --> 12:02.005
Look at this. He gave me a gross.

12:05.409 --> 12:08.481
- What will you do with all of them?
- Oh, well...

12:13.929 --> 12:15.408
Take some, Jerry. Grab them.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.288
No, thanks. They look like
they came out of a cereal box.

12:18.449 --> 12:21.566
Come on, Elaine, here.
Take half a bag.

12:22.489 --> 12:24.605
Half a bag?

12:24.849 --> 12:27.079
What am I, a hooker?

12:28.689 --> 12:30.839
Anyway, they look kind of cheap.

12:32.009 --> 12:34.000
I'll take one.

12:37.809 --> 12:39.288
It's possible.

12:40.569 --> 12:44.118
The problem with the condom
is still buying them.

12:44.289 --> 12:48.521
I think we should have, like,
a secret signal with the druggist.

12:48.689 --> 12:51.283
You walk into the store,
go to the counter. He looks at you.

12:51.449 --> 12:53.167
And if you go like this:

12:55.089 --> 12:57.444
He puts them in the bag
for you. That's it.

12:57.809 --> 13:01.040
Show up there with your little
shaving cream, your little toothpaste.

13:01.209 --> 13:02.642
"How are you today?"

13:05.969 --> 13:08.358
"Have a nice day." "You too."

13:10.689 --> 13:13.408
So where are they? It's 11:45.
They should be back by now.

13:13.569 --> 13:16.129
- What did they do?
- I think they went out to dinner.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.479
Oh, wait. I got another call.
That must be him.

13:18.649 --> 13:20.287
- Hello.
- It's me. I just got home.

13:20.449 --> 13:21.802
Hold on.

13:22.249 --> 13:25.002
- It's George. He just got home.
- Yeah. I got Cynthia on the line.

13:25.169 --> 13:28.923
- I'll call you back when I'm done.
- Remember our pact: full disclosure.

13:29.089 --> 13:30.681
Of course.

13:31.249 --> 13:32.523
Yeah, go ahead.

13:33.249 --> 13:35.683
I'm gonna tell you,
but I made a pact with Cynthia.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.805
We swore we wouldn't tell
you and Elaine.

13:37.969 --> 13:40.039
- You can tell. I'll vault it.
- It's in the vault?

13:40.209 --> 13:43.167
I'm locking the vault. What? Come on.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.088
- We had sex.
- Oh, my God, you had sex?

13:47.249 --> 13:48.967
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.721
I closed my eyes and made a move.

13:50.889 --> 13:52.163
- At your apartment?
- Yeah.

13:52.329 --> 13:54.206
- She didn't stay over?
- No. She left.

13:54.369 --> 13:56.929
Listen, you can't mention
any of this to Elaine.

13:57.089 --> 13:59.683
Cynthia will kill me. We made a deal.

14:00.129 --> 14:01.323
Oh, my God.

14:01.489 --> 14:03.639
He was uncomfortable
because it was our first time.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.881
So he felt he'd perform better
if we did it in the kitchen.

14:07.049 --> 14:08.721
- What?
- He says the kitchen...

14:08.889 --> 14:10.641
...is the most sociable room
in the house.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.037
And he was serious.

14:12.569 --> 14:15.208
- So how was it?
- How good could it be?

14:15.369 --> 14:17.519
My head was on a hot plate.

14:18.289 --> 14:19.881
I got another call. Must be Jerry.

14:20.049 --> 14:23.359
- Oh, don't you tell him any of this.
- Yeah, okay.

14:24.689 --> 14:27.157
- Hello?
- So, what did she say?

14:27.329 --> 14:30.127
- What did he have to say?
- He said he had a good time.

14:30.529 --> 14:32.599
- Her too.
- Oh, good.

14:32.849 --> 14:34.282
- Anything else?
- No.

14:34.729 --> 14:36.799
- You?
- No.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.439
- You sure?
- Yeah.

14:40.049 --> 14:42.609
- You?
- Yeah.

14:44.249 --> 14:46.888
All right, well...

14:47.569 --> 14:49.639
I guess everything is under control.

14:49.809 --> 14:52.004
Yeah. Okay then.

14:52.169 --> 14:53.443
Alrighty.

14:53.729 --> 14:55.128
- Good night.
- Good night.

14:58.769 --> 15:01.920
I left three messages.
I can't believe this woman.

15:02.089 --> 15:05.479
We have sex, she leaves 10 minutes
later, then I never hear from her again.

15:05.649 --> 15:07.287
What kind of a person does this?

15:07.529 --> 15:11.602
She used me. I feel cheap and violated.

15:15.969 --> 15:18.483
- I'm gonna do something about this.
- What are you gonna do?

15:18.649 --> 15:20.560
Never mind. Disgraceful.

15:20.729 --> 15:25.484
Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen
floor like some kind of roach trap.

15:25.929 --> 15:27.965
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

15:28.129 --> 15:30.245
Sir. Whatever.

15:30.809 --> 15:32.606
She's not gonna get away with this.

15:32.849 --> 15:36.239
I keep racking my brain
to try to figure out what I did.

15:36.409 --> 15:38.161
I was smart. I was funny.

15:38.329 --> 15:40.240
I made great small talk
with the waitress...

15:40.409 --> 15:42.877
...so she could see I could relate
to the commoners.

15:43.049 --> 15:44.721
I'm a man of the people.

15:45.009 --> 15:46.442
- I'm gonna call her.
- Don't call.

15:46.609 --> 15:49.362
- No, I'm calling her.
- No, Jerry, I don't want you to.

15:49.529 --> 15:51.565
- Get away from me.
- Give me the phone.

15:51.729 --> 15:54.687
- You wanna fight me?
- Jerry, I'm gonna kill you.

15:54.849 --> 15:56.680
Hey, hey, hey!

15:56.849 --> 15:58.567
Hey, come on, Jerry, George.
Stop it.

15:58.769 --> 16:00.282
I'll just call her when you leave.

16:00.449 --> 16:01.643
It's none of your business!

16:01.809 --> 16:03.959
- It is so my business.
- Give me that!

16:04.129 --> 16:05.881
Stop it, boys!

16:08.969 --> 16:10.687
I don't want another word
from either of you.

16:10.849 --> 16:12.965
- Tell him...
- Hey, hey, hey!

16:15.089 --> 16:18.877
The next one of you that opens your
mouth, you'll have to deal with me.

16:20.849 --> 16:23.522
I bet I know what this is about.
It's about a woman, isn't it?

16:23.849 --> 16:25.328
- Yeah, but...
- You see!

16:25.489 --> 16:27.320
This is exactly what they want
to do to you.

16:27.489 --> 16:29.241
They play one against the other.

16:29.449 --> 16:31.326
You can't let them
manipulate you like that.

16:31.489 --> 16:32.842
- But, Kramer...
- No, no, no!

16:33.009 --> 16:34.727
I want you guys to shake hands.

16:34.969 --> 16:37.563
Come on, there are plenty women
out there for all of us.

16:37.809 --> 16:38.958
Shake.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.001
Yes! You see?

16:41.169 --> 16:43.842
Isn't that better than fighting?
Animosity?

16:44.009 --> 16:46.887
You wanna fight with somebody,
you fight with me.

16:48.409 --> 16:52.288
By the way, those condoms I gave you?
They're defective. Don't use them.

16:58.769 --> 16:59.918
- What?
- Yeah.

17:00.089 --> 17:01.920
- Defective?
- Defective.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.397
How could you give me
a defective condom?

17:05.729 --> 17:07.560
I didn't even know
they were defective.

17:07.729 --> 17:09.799
- Didn't think you'd use them.
- What do you mean...?!

17:11.009 --> 17:12.157
Take it easy.

17:12.329 --> 17:14.205
Just spread out!

17:22.569 --> 17:25.402
Don't worry. If anything was wrong,
she'd have called you.

17:27.128 --> 17:28.642
I missed my period.

17:29.489 --> 17:30.842
Oh, my God!

17:31.089 --> 17:34.684
I am very worried. I am never late.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.681
But he used a condom, right?

17:36.849 --> 17:39.602
I know, but these things
aren't always foolproof.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.765
Oh, no.

17:44.449 --> 17:45.723
What?

17:45.889 --> 17:47.242
Was it blue?

17:49.009 --> 17:51.079
Yeah. How'd you know?

17:52.369 --> 17:54.087
Just a hunch.

17:58.769 --> 18:02.967
It says "twist-off."
Twist off! Twist! Off!

18:04.689 --> 18:06.725
Oh, hi. Soda?

18:07.449 --> 18:08.962
No, thanks.

18:09.969 --> 18:11.527
So tell me.

18:11.689 --> 18:15.318
What's the problem with your little
flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?

18:16.249 --> 18:18.126
Who are you to talk
about her like that?

18:18.289 --> 18:20.166
She'll call him when she's
good and ready.

18:20.369 --> 18:22.280
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, I know her.

18:22.529 --> 18:23.757
I know her type.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.439
Her type? What type?

18:26.609 --> 18:28.088
The type that doesn't return calls.

18:28.249 --> 18:31.400
I knew we shouldn't have done it.
It was a bad idea. I told you.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.402
You told me? You pushed
this whole thing on me.

18:34.569 --> 18:35.843
It was your idea.

18:36.009 --> 18:38.239
I was just helping your bitter,
twisted friend.

18:38.689 --> 18:39.963
She's not bitter.

18:40.129 --> 18:41.881
Bitter's a judgment call.
She's twisted.

18:42.049 --> 18:45.325
Twisted? God, I did you a favour!

18:45.489 --> 18:48.287
You said they had a good time.
What else are you keeping from me?

18:48.449 --> 18:51.088
- Are you calling me a liar?
- I'm calling you one if you are.

18:51.249 --> 18:53.080
- Are you?
- Get your finger out of my face.

18:53.249 --> 18:55.285
- Get yours out.
- I don't care.

18:55.449 --> 18:57.804
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

18:57.969 --> 19:00.563
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, stop it!

19:00.729 --> 19:02.640
Come on. Break it up!

19:03.409 --> 19:04.637
Hey, hey!

19:05.209 --> 19:07.086
What's the matter with you?

19:08.169 --> 19:12.685
Now, don't you two see
that you're in love with each other?

19:15.049 --> 19:17.165
I mean, why can't you
face that already?

19:17.329 --> 19:20.048
You're running around looking
for something not even there...

19:20.209 --> 19:23.281
...when everything you dream of
is right here in front of you.

19:23.449 --> 19:25.246
Now why can't you admit that?

19:25.929 --> 19:28.762
By the way, when you see George,
give him these. These'll work.

19:30.689 --> 19:33.726
I knew those condoms
were defective!

19:34.209 --> 19:36.928
How did you know
they were defective?!

19:37.209 --> 19:41.361
Because! Because she missed
her period!

19:41.889 --> 19:43.959
She missed her period?

19:47.249 --> 19:49.001
Oh, my God!

19:49.409 --> 19:51.127
I can't believe it.

19:51.569 --> 19:54.003
I'm a father! I did it!

19:54.169 --> 19:55.682
My boys can swim!

19:55.849 --> 19:59.808
I can do it! I can do it!
I'm a father!

20:04.689 --> 20:07.487
So he shows up. He's all out of breath.
He's dishevelled.

20:07.649 --> 20:11.847
And tells me that whatever happens,
whatever I decide is fine with him...

20:12.449 --> 20:13.848
...and I could depend on him...

20:14.009 --> 20:17.126
...and that he'd support me
in whatever way I need.

20:17.449 --> 20:20.009
Elaine, I was speechless.

20:20.489 --> 20:23.640
Wow. Wow. You see?
You think you know somebody.

20:23.809 --> 20:27.358
I said to him, " I really appreciate this,
but I just got my period."

20:27.529 --> 20:29.121
- Yeah.
- So I asked him to come in...

20:29.289 --> 20:30.608
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

20:30.769 --> 20:34.842
Sorry we're late. We got so
hung up in traffic. I'm sorry.

20:35.689 --> 20:37.645
- What happened?
- Acting.

20:40.409 --> 20:42.764
- Very mature.
- Thank you.

20:43.649 --> 20:45.082
- Hi, Cynthia.
- Hi.

20:45.249 --> 20:47.524
This is a great place to sit
you got here.

20:47.769 --> 20:49.919
Best seat in the house.
Right next to the kitchen.

20:50.089 --> 20:52.000
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

20:54.569 --> 20:57.402
- So, what are these?
- We ordered appetizers. Start eating.

20:57.969 --> 20:59.402
Oh, fabulous.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.520
This is good. Oh, this is good.

21:05.409 --> 21:07.479
Is that salt on this?

21:08.049 --> 21:09.767
Is there salt on this?

21:10.009 --> 21:11.806
But have you ever fixed anybody up?

21:11.969 --> 21:13.800
Why do we do it? Why?

21:14.289 --> 21:15.881
You thought
they'd have a good time...

21:16.049 --> 21:18.005
...and a little power trip
for you, isn't it?

21:18.729 --> 21:19.957
Now you're playing God.

21:20.129 --> 21:23.087
Of course, God was
the first person to fix people up.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.080
He fixed up Adam and Eve.

21:25.249 --> 21:27.046
I'm sure he said to Adam,
"No, she's nice.

21:27.209 --> 21:32.522
She's... Yes, she's very free
about her body.

21:32.689 --> 21:34.759
Doesn't really wear much.

21:34.929 --> 21:38.080
She was going out with a snake.
I think that's over, though."

22:25.009 --> 22:27.000
