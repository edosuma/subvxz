WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.434
Previously, on Chesapeake Shores...

00:01.440 --> 00:02.832
What happened between you and Bree?

00:02.867 --> 00:04.767
Bree isn't very good at keeping secrets.

00:04.773 --> 00:06.215
I saw Danielle come out of a restaurant

00:06.221 --> 00:08.047
with some guy. They seemed close.

00:08.053 --> 00:09.309
I don't want to see you get hurt.

00:09.315 --> 00:11.240
You assume she's cheating on me,

00:11.275 --> 00:12.570
and you don't want me to be hurt?

00:12.576 --> 00:14.410
David's inviting us to
Maine to meet his parents!

00:14.445 --> 00:16.122
Do you ever think about what would've

00:16.128 --> 00:17.689
happened if I had come
back from New York?

00:17.695 --> 00:19.595
Something tells me I'd
still be here with you.

00:19.601 --> 00:21.695
Robin! What brings you back here?

00:21.701 --> 00:23.402
They're gonna renew their vows.

00:23.408 --> 00:26.053
Just seems that after 30
years of trying harder...

00:26.059 --> 00:28.126
Thanks for the support, Mick.

00:34.347 --> 00:35.380
Whoo!

00:35.415 --> 00:36.714
Grapevine to the right...

00:36.750 --> 00:38.515
Heel! Grapevine to the left...

00:38.521 --> 00:40.351
Heel! And heel! And... kick.

00:40.689 --> 00:41.955
Ta-dah!

00:41.961 --> 00:43.087
Whoo!

00:43.123 --> 00:44.639
We end on the right foot.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.516
Oops! My other right foot. Heh.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.356
Maybe Mom wants to try.

00:48.362 --> 00:49.494
Yeah! Come on!

00:49.529 --> 00:51.329
Uh, girls, actually,
we need to get going,

00:51.364 --> 00:52.697
or you're going to be
late for gymnastics.

00:52.732 --> 00:53.943
Boo!

00:53.949 --> 00:55.600
Okay.

00:55.635 --> 00:57.101
You know, one of these days,

00:57.137 --> 00:59.504
you're gonna run out of excuses,

00:59.539 --> 01:01.172
and I'm gonna teach you
how to line dance.

01:01.207 --> 01:04.342
Uh, no, but, see, I
have years of excuses

01:04.376 --> 01:05.543
all stocked up.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.881
So, Bree's manuscript
getting any easier to read?

01:09.916 --> 01:12.250
Uh, it's not so bad for me,

01:12.285 --> 01:15.170
but I think it's going to be
hard for some of the family.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.421
Anything about me?

01:16.456 --> 01:17.789
There is a part

01:17.824 --> 01:19.724
about a dashing country line dancer.

01:19.759 --> 01:21.559
Who can't tell his left
foot from his right?

01:21.594 --> 01:24.312
But his girlfriend's
daughters love him anyways.

01:25.328 --> 01:27.465
I can't believe your
break is over already.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.532
Well, this time, I won't
be gone for so long.

01:29.538 --> 01:31.636
Three weeks, and I'll be
touring the mid-Atlantic,

01:31.671 --> 01:33.237
so I'll be close to home for a month.

01:33.273 --> 01:35.740
Mm. It's gonna be tough sharing you.

01:35.775 --> 01:37.275
You could always come with me.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.611
Ah, Trace, I told you, I'm no groupie.

01:40.647 --> 01:43.147
Groupie? I was thinking roadie.

01:43.183 --> 01:44.549
How are you at heavy lifting?

01:44.584 --> 01:45.717
I'm very strong.

01:45.752 --> 01:47.752
Let me see. You are strong.

01:47.787 --> 01:50.588
Actually, I already have a second job.

01:50.623 --> 01:53.791
I am now the new night
manager over at Jess's B&B

01:53.827 --> 01:54.992
while she's out of town with Bree.

01:55.028 --> 01:56.461
That should be fun for the girls,

01:56.496 --> 01:58.496
- kind of like a sleepover.
- Yeah, you should come by.

01:58.531 --> 02:00.941
Say goodnight to the
girls, read them a story.

02:02.410 --> 02:04.644
I mean, if you... if you...
if you want to do that.

02:04.650 --> 02:07.071
- You don't have to.
- No, no. No. It sounds like fun.

02:07.216 --> 02:09.354
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:09.691 --> 02:11.491
I mean, it's a lot of work.

02:11.497 --> 02:12.596
Abby...

02:12.602 --> 02:14.512
I only have three more days at home,

02:14.518 --> 02:16.223
and I want to spend every minute of it

02:16.258 --> 02:18.449
with you, Carrie, and Caitlyn.

02:20.013 --> 02:21.210
Come on.

02:21.216 --> 02:22.920
What? No, no, no!

02:22.956 --> 02:25.123
I have a headache!
And I need to go to work,

02:25.158 --> 02:26.459
and I have to wash my hair...

02:26.465 --> 02:28.259
Abby, just dance with us, okay?

02:30.063 --> 02:31.362
Let's show her how it's done.

02:31.397 --> 02:33.698
Ready? One, two, three!

02:33.733 --> 02:34.966
Heel, heel,

02:35.001 --> 02:37.335
toe, toe, toe-toe-toe...

02:37.370 --> 02:40.104
Slap, slap, grapevine to the right...

02:41.574 --> 02:42.840
Grapevine to the left...

02:42.876 --> 02:45.109
Heel... and heel... and kick!

03:54.694 --> 03:57.195
- Hello.
- Don't even think about it.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.241
These belong to our beloved mayor.

04:00.276 --> 04:02.610
Ooh. What, you gonna throw them at him?

04:02.645 --> 04:05.487
Well, only if "killing with
kindness" doesn't work.

04:05.493 --> 04:07.095
Gran, I thought you already
tried the muffins.

04:07.101 --> 04:08.182
I did.

04:08.218 --> 04:09.817
I baked 'em, he ate 'em,

04:09.853 --> 04:12.386
but this time, it'll cost him.

04:12.422 --> 04:14.507
Has anyone seen my sparkly heels?

04:14.513 --> 04:16.072
The ones you can't walk in?

04:16.077 --> 04:18.411
Caitlyn was using them for a spaceship.

04:18.581 --> 04:19.990
Check my closet.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.845
So, when are you two
leaving for David's?

04:24.851 --> 04:26.183
Um, five minutes?

04:26.189 --> 04:27.455
Cab's coming to take us to the airport.

04:27.490 --> 04:28.695
- Oh.
- Ooh!

04:28.701 --> 04:30.258
They're for the beloved mayor.

04:30.293 --> 04:31.415
Isn't that a bribe?

04:31.421 --> 04:33.294
Well, only if I get caught.

04:33.329 --> 04:34.395
Ha.

04:34.430 --> 04:35.630
Cherry red or Kelly green?

04:35.665 --> 04:37.431
- Cherry red.
- Kelly green.

04:37.467 --> 04:38.933
Right. I'll take both.

04:38.968 --> 04:40.070
Are you packed?

04:40.076 --> 04:41.936
Yeah. It's just... it's out...

04:41.971 --> 04:43.137
Never mind,

04:43.172 --> 04:44.805
Connor...

04:44.841 --> 04:46.842
I really appreciate you
helping me out with Wordplay,

04:46.848 --> 04:48.509
but you don't have to, like, dress up.

04:48.544 --> 04:50.739
Actually, I have, no, I have
a date with Danielle after.

04:50.745 --> 04:52.146
Hey, how's that going, by the way?

04:52.181 --> 04:54.482
Danielle and I are great.
We're totally great.

04:55.770 --> 04:57.318
Hey, why do they get muffins?

04:57.353 --> 04:59.253
Well, Nana plays favorites.

04:59.289 --> 05:00.773
What?

05:03.059 --> 05:04.859
Farewell, Mother...

05:04.894 --> 05:07.528
Grandmother, siblings,
and the princesses.

05:07.563 --> 05:09.497
I shall be traveling to Maine today

05:09.532 --> 05:11.265
to visit the Boston Pecks.

05:11.301 --> 05:12.833
Shouldn't that be "the Maine Pecks"?

05:12.869 --> 05:14.769
Ah! Very amusing.

05:14.804 --> 05:17.772
I shall wait outside for moi carriage.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.183
Bree, try and keep Jess relaxed

05:21.189 --> 05:22.431
when she meets David's parents.

05:22.437 --> 05:24.478
Well, considering she's
not talking to me,

05:24.514 --> 05:26.113
I can't guarantee anything.

05:26.149 --> 05:27.515
"Farewell."

05:27.550 --> 05:28.697
- Tah-tah.
- Bye!

05:28.703 --> 05:30.644
And I have got to open Wordplay.

05:30.650 --> 05:32.320
- Goodbye.
- See you later.

05:32.355 --> 05:33.582
Ha! Uh...

05:34.590 --> 05:37.124
Oh, I love you, Gran.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.526
We're gonna say goodbye, too.

05:38.561 --> 05:40.061
You guys, have fun!

05:40.096 --> 05:42.196
- Bye!
- My sweet sugar.

05:42.231 --> 05:43.698
- Mm! I love you.
- Love you, too.

05:43.733 --> 05:45.232
Have fun today!

05:45.268 --> 05:47.234
You're taking a bottle
of wine to Jess's B&B?

05:47.270 --> 05:49.070
Uh, yes. Trace is coming by later

05:49.105 --> 05:50.671
to hang out with me and the girls.

05:50.707 --> 05:52.078
They're gonna love that.

05:52.084 --> 05:53.884
Yes, bedtime stories. It's gonna be fun.

05:53.890 --> 05:54.976
His first time?

05:55.011 --> 05:56.077
- Mm-hmm.
- Aww!

05:56.112 --> 05:58.145
Bedtime is the last stop

05:58.181 --> 06:01.382
before we free our souls to dream.

06:01.417 --> 06:02.750
Wait a second, Gran.

06:02.785 --> 06:04.185
You read Ms. Marvel's blog?

06:04.220 --> 06:05.792
She is a very wise woman.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.331
Well, she's simply marvelous.

06:07.585 --> 06:09.554
You know what else was marvelous?

06:09.560 --> 06:10.925
Having Connor swing by today.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.593
Oh, well, that's because

06:12.628 --> 06:14.753
Dad is at the B&B with Kevin.

06:14.759 --> 06:16.764
They're running the B&B right now?

06:16.799 --> 06:18.265
That can't be going well.

06:18.301 --> 06:20.059
Oh, yes, but Dad said it's okay,

06:20.065 --> 06:23.600
because between his experience
and Kevin's education,

06:23.773 --> 06:25.439
running the B&B will be a piece of cake.

06:25.475 --> 06:26.573
Ah.

06:29.946 --> 06:32.179
I'm not cleaning up.

06:36.219 --> 06:38.552
So, you and Connor are
still not speaking?

06:38.588 --> 06:40.988
Ah, not really. Ever since he moved out,

06:41.024 --> 06:43.024
we just haven't seen each
other all that much.

06:43.059 --> 06:44.429
Hey, how many teaspoons are in an ounce?

06:44.435 --> 06:46.861
Six. Kevin, you had to tell Connor

06:46.896 --> 06:48.696
that you saw Danielle with another guy.

06:48.731 --> 06:50.765
And you better hurry
up with those quiches,

06:50.800 --> 06:52.266
or that family from Aberdeen's

06:52.301 --> 06:54.201
gonna be telling you all
about their vacation again.

06:54.237 --> 06:55.269
Don't worry, okay?

06:55.304 --> 06:57.038
I've got this. And I know
I had to say something,

06:57.073 --> 06:58.906
but that doesn't always
make it any easier.

06:58.941 --> 07:01.609
Well, nobody wants to hear
what they don't want to hear.

07:01.644 --> 07:03.811
And the Bennetts need more scones.

07:03.846 --> 07:05.880
Seriously? How many scones
can one family eat?

07:05.915 --> 07:08.115
Even if it's good for them to hear it.

07:08.151 --> 07:10.251
Oh, yeah. Hey, uh...

07:10.286 --> 07:11.585
Cilantro and coriander...

07:11.621 --> 07:12.787
They're the same thing, right?

07:12.822 --> 07:15.719
Well, it's the same plant, but
coriander comes from the seeds.

07:15.725 --> 07:17.191
You were just looking
out for your brother.

07:17.226 --> 07:19.460
I know, but with Connor,
it's impossible to know

07:19.495 --> 07:20.928
if doing the right thing is helping him

07:20.963 --> 07:22.730
- more than hurting him.
- You're only doing for him

07:22.765 --> 07:24.432
what you'd want him to do for you.

07:24.467 --> 07:25.566
Yeah.

07:25.601 --> 07:27.268
Oh! God.

07:28.938 --> 07:31.972
You know, I just really
need to talk this out

07:32.008 --> 07:33.431
with him and clear the air.

07:33.437 --> 07:34.842
I hate having this between us.

07:34.877 --> 07:36.477
Hey, how do you know the difference

07:36.512 --> 07:38.224
between coriander and cilantro?

07:38.230 --> 07:40.114
Social media.

07:41.784 --> 07:44.085
_

07:59.402 --> 08:00.661
Hello.

08:01.364 --> 08:04.171
Are summer homes bigger or
smaller than winter homes?

08:04.683 --> 08:05.848
I don't know.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.678
I wasn't talking to you.

08:09.245 --> 08:11.779
- Who was the question for, then?
- It was rhetorical.

08:11.814 --> 08:14.177
Okay, Jess, I cannot keep apologizing.

08:14.183 --> 08:15.516
Eventually, we have to make up.

08:15.551 --> 08:16.951
I'm fully aware of eventually,

08:16.986 --> 08:19.739
but due to the sheer
intensity of this situation,

08:19.745 --> 08:21.155
which is very intense,

08:21.190 --> 08:23.491
I simply need you as my wing woman.

08:26.526 --> 08:28.295
You know, they're just
like any other family.

08:28.331 --> 08:29.463
No, they're not.

08:29.499 --> 08:31.365
They're the Boston Pecks.

08:31.547 --> 08:33.648
- They own a little of...
- Everything.

08:35.037 --> 08:36.169
Okay.

08:36.205 --> 08:38.371
Uh-oh. Are you freaking out?

08:38.407 --> 08:40.474
T... Totally.

08:40.626 --> 08:42.025
What if David doesn't feel anything?

08:42.332 --> 08:44.466
What if we only have the B&B in common?

08:44.472 --> 08:46.172
What if, without the inn, we...

08:57.266 --> 08:58.559
David.

08:59.862 --> 09:01.729
Um... Mom.

09:01.764 --> 09:04.231
Dad, Alex, I'd like you to
meet my girlfriend, Jess.

09:06.373 --> 09:08.440
And her sister, Bree.

09:08.446 --> 09:10.004
Welcome to our summer home.

09:10.039 --> 09:11.372
Thank you.

09:11.407 --> 09:13.143
- Please. Come on in.
- Okay.

09:14.310 --> 09:15.676
Hi!

09:22.427 --> 09:24.294
- Hello!
- There you are.

09:24.329 --> 09:25.628
Uh, just so you know,

09:25.664 --> 09:27.904
- we are sold out of Simon Atwater.
- Good.

09:27.910 --> 09:29.228
Gave people a 5% discount if they

09:29.234 --> 09:30.471
bought both "Caroline" books.

09:30.502 --> 09:32.390
- Worked like a charm.
- Brilliant.

09:32.396 --> 09:33.970
Oh! I am late.

09:34.005 --> 09:35.038
See ya.

09:35.073 --> 09:36.172
- Bye.
- Mwah!

09:36.178 --> 09:37.803
Off to go see Danielle?

09:37.955 --> 09:40.376
Oh, come on. Kevin told you, too?

09:41.196 --> 09:42.345
Told me what?

09:42.380 --> 09:43.746
Danielle?

09:43.782 --> 09:45.148
Dinner with another guy?

09:45.363 --> 09:48.397
Oh, no... Conn, I didn't know.

09:49.235 --> 09:50.468
Oh.

09:50.722 --> 09:52.000
Then disregard.

09:52.969 --> 09:55.236
Danielle and I are great.
We're totally great.

09:55.503 --> 09:56.836
I'll see you later.

09:56.871 --> 09:58.437
Bye.

10:05.647 --> 10:06.913
Robin!

10:06.948 --> 10:08.614
- Hey.
- Hey!

10:08.650 --> 10:10.516
I was just out, picking up a few things,

10:10.551 --> 10:12.084
before we head to Bali next week,

10:12.120 --> 10:14.256
and thought I'd swing
by and say hi to Bree.

10:14.262 --> 10:15.811
Oh, you missed her.

10:15.817 --> 10:17.225
I'm filling in for a couple days

10:17.231 --> 10:18.631
while she and Jess are out of town.

10:18.637 --> 10:20.819
Aww! Too bad.

10:21.289 --> 10:23.296
- Look at this!
- I know!

10:23.664 --> 10:26.127
She's really done a great job

10:26.133 --> 10:27.432
with this new place, huh?

10:27.438 --> 10:29.037
Mm-hmm.

10:32.025 --> 10:33.866
I talked to Nell.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.401
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

10:35.436 --> 10:36.888
Does she still think that Thomas

10:36.894 --> 10:38.209
made a mistake marrying me?

10:38.239 --> 10:39.299
Mm-hmm.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.437
Great.

10:40.443 --> 10:42.836
How's it been for you,
since you've been back here?

10:43.602 --> 10:44.744
The truth?

10:46.114 --> 10:48.381
Sometimes confusing.

10:49.517 --> 10:51.951
Guess I'm still trying to
figure out how I fit in.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.774
Well, then I guess things
really haven't changed

10:54.780 --> 10:56.756
all that much for either
one of us, have they?

10:56.791 --> 10:57.957
Nope.

10:57.992 --> 10:59.725
You become part of this family,

10:59.761 --> 11:02.728
you spend your life trying
to crack that O'Brien code.

11:02.764 --> 11:04.063
For better or worse.

11:04.069 --> 11:05.151
Oh, yes.

11:05.157 --> 11:07.166
Ohh... I love this.

11:07.201 --> 11:09.001
So do I, but look at this.

11:14.681 --> 11:16.614
How lucky am I?

11:16.978 --> 11:20.246
On a double date with my beloved Mayor.

11:21.616 --> 11:23.149
Muffin?

11:23.348 --> 11:24.814
You have three minutes.

11:26.017 --> 11:27.619
I suppose you're here to

11:27.625 --> 11:29.293
extend an olive branch?

11:29.323 --> 11:31.157
Well, actually...

11:31.192 --> 11:33.701
I was hoping to declare a victory.

11:35.630 --> 11:38.531
As much as I appreciate your
passion for our town...

11:38.566 --> 11:40.366
You know, Mayor, have I ever told you

11:40.401 --> 11:42.668
how our beloved fountain came to be?

11:42.703 --> 11:45.538
When Charles took me on a long drive

11:45.573 --> 11:47.210
to a really, very special spot...

11:47.216 --> 11:48.941
You have told me this story

11:48.976 --> 11:50.948
- about 20 times, Nell.
- Oh...

11:50.954 --> 11:53.234
But the fountain's going to be
torn down for the city hall

11:53.240 --> 11:55.519
expansion, whether you like it or not.

11:55.550 --> 11:56.849
The decision's been made.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.518
Well, minds can be changed,

11:59.554 --> 12:02.847
and I'm not stopping
until I change yours.

12:03.131 --> 12:05.164
Or until the wish fountain's gone.

12:15.036 --> 12:16.202
Five. Chute!

12:16.237 --> 12:18.971
One, two, three, four... Oh!

12:20.408 --> 12:22.439
Ladder! I'm at 99.

12:22.445 --> 12:24.412
You guys are killing me.

12:24.418 --> 12:26.514
All right, girls. It is bedtime.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.965
But we haven't finished the game yet.

12:27.971 --> 12:30.082
Well, we will put it up on the counter,

12:30.117 --> 12:31.409
and we can finish it tomorrow night.

12:31.415 --> 12:33.524
All right. Teeth, and
then bedtime story.

12:33.530 --> 12:34.753
Will you read to us, Trace?

12:34.789 --> 12:35.897
Of course.

12:35.903 --> 12:37.263
Come on.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.553
There is no way anyone could hit

12:38.559 --> 12:39.952
so many ladders without cheating.

12:39.983 --> 12:41.347
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

12:41.353 --> 12:43.496
- they've never lost a game.
- It doesn't.

12:44.273 --> 12:46.096
But, besides that, this is going well.

12:46.102 --> 12:48.303
Yeah. How are you doing?

12:48.338 --> 12:49.504
Abby, this is great.

12:49.539 --> 12:50.838
We're ready!

12:50.874 --> 12:51.906
I got this.

12:51.941 --> 12:53.841
Come on.

12:54.158 --> 12:57.192
Mom makes silly faces,
Dad makes funny voices.

12:57.198 --> 12:58.655
And Grandpa does both.

13:02.483 --> 13:04.485
We're on chapter three.

13:04.521 --> 13:06.254
Okay...

13:06.289 --> 13:08.523
Now, I could read this book to you,

13:08.558 --> 13:09.991
or...

13:10.026 --> 13:12.727
I could tell you all about... snipes.

13:13.391 --> 13:14.696
What are those?

13:14.731 --> 13:18.666
A snipe is a mythical and
mischievous little creature

13:18.702 --> 13:20.313
who lives in the woods

13:20.319 --> 13:23.037
and shimmers and sparkles in the light.

13:23.073 --> 13:24.439
Have you ever seen one?

13:24.474 --> 13:25.940
As a matter of fact, I have,

13:25.975 --> 13:29.330
but only once, when I was
just about your age.

13:29.808 --> 13:31.290
So do you wanna hear the story?

13:31.296 --> 13:32.323
Yeah!

13:35.151 --> 13:36.751
Okay.

13:36.786 --> 13:38.619
Well, one late afternoon,

13:38.655 --> 13:40.621
I believe it was a Wednesday,

13:40.657 --> 13:42.423
I was walking through the woods,

13:42.459 --> 13:46.861
and there was a really eerie
fog kinda rolling through,

13:46.896 --> 13:48.996
and I could... I could hear something...

13:54.579 --> 13:56.746
Make a wish.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.485
But it already came true.

14:07.362 --> 14:09.028
I missed you.

14:09.034 --> 14:10.500
Really?

14:10.506 --> 14:11.738
Yeah.

14:12.037 --> 14:13.470
When we didn't talk for three days,

14:13.476 --> 14:15.225
I thought you forgot about me.

14:15.977 --> 14:17.311
Me, too.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.360
So what's up with you and Bree?

14:21.397 --> 14:23.898
That's just it.

14:24.402 --> 14:27.804
The book wasn't about me, exactly...

14:28.723 --> 14:30.056
But, some parts

14:30.091 --> 14:32.081
were just like looking in the mirror,

14:32.471 --> 14:33.822
and I just...

14:34.388 --> 14:36.488
I didn't like what I saw.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.979
Well, I'm looking at you...

14:42.215 --> 14:43.981
And you look beautiful.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.606
Everything you do

14:47.566 --> 14:49.909
just makes every day an adventure.

14:52.188 --> 14:54.668
But without you, it's not
as much fun anymore.

14:55.282 --> 14:58.343
There's no one to make
birthday cakes for no reason.

15:02.161 --> 15:03.861
I snuck off between calls

15:03.867 --> 15:05.208
to Miami and New York.

15:05.214 --> 15:06.282
I should...

15:07.624 --> 15:09.090
One more time.

15:09.510 --> 15:11.143
Seriously?

15:11.149 --> 15:12.681
Seriously.

15:12.717 --> 15:14.150
Ahem.

15:14.185 --> 15:15.803
Okay. Ahem.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.286
Make a wish.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.923
It already came true.

15:37.782 --> 15:40.149
All right, let's reconvene in an hour.

15:40.155 --> 15:41.684
Thank you very much.

15:43.247 --> 15:45.892
Is this the Leiter-Norse
pharmaceutical merger?

15:45.898 --> 15:47.363
Uh, it is, hi.

15:47.369 --> 15:50.185
From what I read, those guys
really hate each other.

15:50.191 --> 15:52.591
Well, you are reading the
same things that I am.

15:53.689 --> 15:56.657
You came to Baltimore
to bring me breakfast?

15:56.692 --> 15:58.625
No, no, I have three
meetings in my office,

15:58.661 --> 16:01.246
and I thought I'd kill two
birds with one scone.

16:01.371 --> 16:02.496
It's a Dad joke.

16:02.531 --> 16:04.162
Actually, it's quiche.

16:04.569 --> 16:06.736
- And who made this?
- Oh, Kevin did.

16:06.742 --> 16:08.709
I draw the line at making quiche.

16:08.715 --> 16:10.982
Carrie told me they're
learning about Snipes.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.572
Yes!

16:12.608 --> 16:14.541
And Trace put them to bed last night,

16:14.576 --> 16:15.909
and they fell asleep

16:15.944 --> 16:18.011
to him singing a lullaby.

16:18.047 --> 16:20.190
Oh, I used to love doing
that with you guys.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.548
I remember.

16:23.018 --> 16:25.319
Dad, you know you can call Connor.

16:25.706 --> 16:28.674
Oh, I think we're a little bit
past lullabies now, honey.

16:29.525 --> 16:30.949
Well?

16:31.393 --> 16:32.926
I actually have to eat it?

16:32.961 --> 16:34.194
Oh, yeah.

16:40.035 --> 16:42.005
Oh! That's...

16:42.011 --> 16:44.104
That's worse than his
macaroni and meatballs.

16:44.139 --> 16:45.845
I know! Right? That's what I thought.

16:45.851 --> 16:47.392
- He's really awful.
- He's a terrible cook!

16:47.398 --> 16:49.333
Why did you bring this to me?

16:50.045 --> 16:51.178
So...

16:51.534 --> 16:53.734
David tells us that you run an inn?

16:56.803 --> 16:59.390
Yes. I do... an inn.

17:00.422 --> 17:03.041
Although I prefer to call it an auberge.

17:05.627 --> 17:07.694
C'est très exclusif.

17:07.730 --> 17:08.962
C'est magnifique!

17:08.997 --> 17:10.130
Vous parlez français?

17:10.165 --> 17:11.304
Mm-hmm.

17:13.234 --> 17:15.902
Nous préférons parler
français seulement en France,

17:15.938 --> 17:17.645
la pays de sa naissance.

17:19.174 --> 17:21.875
You prefer to speak
French only in France,

17:21.910 --> 17:23.263
the country of its birth?

17:23.270 --> 17:24.978
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:25.012 --> 17:26.646
Je comprends parfaitement.

17:26.682 --> 17:28.548
We'll just speak English then.

17:28.974 --> 17:30.240
Delightful.

17:31.587 --> 17:33.653
I'm glad you're feeling better, Mr.Peck.

17:33.689 --> 17:35.956
Oh, please, call me
Dennis, and thank you.

17:35.991 --> 17:37.508
I'm uh, I'm very glad that the

17:37.514 --> 17:39.231
two of you were able to make it.

17:39.261 --> 17:41.284
David, your mother and
I are off to the club,

17:41.290 --> 17:43.257
and you, you have your London call.

17:45.072 --> 17:46.438
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

17:47.655 --> 17:49.455
I have to go to play adult.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.071
Play adult?

17:51.106 --> 17:52.973
My family has board seats

17:53.008 --> 17:54.608
on five high-tech companies,

17:54.643 --> 17:57.277
so it's a lot of overseas calls,

17:57.312 --> 17:59.318
but we'll talk later?

18:00.048 --> 18:01.857
It's going really well, right?

18:02.651 --> 18:04.347
It's going amazing.

18:04.353 --> 18:05.552
Okay.

18:07.338 --> 18:09.806
Nell, I've never seen anybody

18:09.841 --> 18:11.908
work so hard at a marriage.

18:11.943 --> 18:14.977
30 years, they've been trying.

18:15.013 --> 18:16.506
And now they've finally

18:16.512 --> 18:18.545
decided to spend more time together,

18:18.551 --> 18:20.260
in the same city.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.784
Well, it's their life,

18:21.820 --> 18:23.086
and all I want

18:23.121 --> 18:26.022
is for my son and his wife to be happy.

18:27.183 --> 18:28.510
I know you do.

18:29.731 --> 18:31.494
They're not giving up...

18:31.529 --> 18:33.329
Reminds me of someone else I know.

18:33.364 --> 18:35.431
Oh, ho. Thank you, darling.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.208
Uh, I'll take

18:38.214 --> 18:40.498
three lunch specials with fries,

18:40.504 --> 18:41.970
extra ketchup,

18:42.107 --> 18:43.439
and three brownies.

18:43.475 --> 18:45.074
Thanks.

18:45.110 --> 18:46.556
Hungry?

18:47.112 --> 18:49.145
Nah, it's for Carrie and Caitlyn.

18:49.180 --> 18:50.258
I'm watching them this afternoon.

18:50.264 --> 18:51.844
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

18:51.850 --> 18:53.149
I can imagine it must be hard

18:53.184 --> 18:54.617
going back out on the road?

18:54.652 --> 18:56.586
You have no idea.

18:56.621 --> 18:58.361
Actually, I do.

18:58.367 --> 18:59.898
It was always the day before

18:59.904 --> 19:01.618
deployment that was the hardest.

19:01.624 --> 19:03.659
I would just spend every
second soaking it in.

19:03.694 --> 19:05.961
And the longer you're away,
the more you miss it.

19:05.997 --> 19:08.498
Yeah. It's funny, because, at first,

19:08.533 --> 19:10.500
I just couldn't wait to
get away from everything,

19:10.535 --> 19:12.034
but now that school's done,

19:12.070 --> 19:14.036
I'm just hoping I can find
a job somewhere close.

19:14.072 --> 19:15.204
Yeah...

19:15.240 --> 19:16.506
it's hard to leave Sally's.

19:16.541 --> 19:18.775
The pastrami Reuben! Yeah.

19:18.810 --> 19:20.176
Thanks.

19:20.211 --> 19:21.811
Here you go. Keep the change.

19:21.846 --> 19:23.450
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

19:23.456 --> 19:25.898
I will have every
pie that you have left.

19:26.184 --> 19:27.682
Hungry?

19:27.956 --> 19:30.086
Yeah!

19:31.356 --> 19:32.702
Have a good day.

19:37.695 --> 19:38.928
Hey.

19:39.509 --> 19:40.976
Heard you were here.

19:41.151 --> 19:42.799
You're spying on me now?

19:44.321 --> 19:45.720
What do you want?

19:46.004 --> 19:47.537
I don't know.

19:47.572 --> 19:50.416
I just thought that maybe
I should come apologize.

19:51.376 --> 19:53.676
I never should've gotten
involved in your life.

19:55.475 --> 19:57.013
Thank you.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.444
You know, it's just sometimes,

19:59.450 --> 20:00.817
as your brother, I have to...

20:00.852 --> 20:02.485
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Don't do that.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.220
You're not planning on apologizing,

20:04.255 --> 20:06.154
then letting me know you'd
do it again, are you?

20:06.160 --> 20:08.273
I was just explaining why I did it.

20:08.279 --> 20:10.225
Well, it sounds like you're
about to justify it,

20:10.231 --> 20:12.202
which really doesn't make
this an apology, does it?

20:12.208 --> 20:14.263
Connor, I was just looking out for you!

20:14.299 --> 20:15.808
Oh, right.

20:16.088 --> 20:17.368
Kevin, "my brother's keeper,"

20:17.787 --> 20:19.092
making sure I know

20:19.098 --> 20:21.233
what my girlfriend's doing
at all hours of the day.

20:23.274 --> 20:25.041
That is completely unfair.

20:25.448 --> 20:27.109
And you know that.

20:27.145 --> 20:29.545
What I know is that you're
wrong about Danielle,

20:29.775 --> 20:32.313
and you obviously have no
idea how to apologize.

20:32.319 --> 20:34.383
Yeah, at least I came
down here and I tried.

20:34.419 --> 20:36.118
What, is that supposed
to make it all better?

20:36.154 --> 20:37.220
Well, it certainly doesn't
make things worse!

20:37.255 --> 20:38.521
Is that what you think?

20:38.556 --> 20:40.723
You pull me aside in a public place,

20:40.758 --> 20:42.391
assume that my girlfriend's
cheating on me,

20:42.427 --> 20:44.088
and, what, you want me to thank you?

20:44.094 --> 20:46.629
- That's not even remotely what I want.
- Good!

20:46.664 --> 20:48.564
The next time you come to apologize,

20:48.600 --> 20:50.974
prepare an apology. It might help.

20:50.980 --> 20:52.970
Because I don't need
your justifications,

20:52.976 --> 20:55.309
and I certainly don't
need your sympathy!

21:07.179 --> 21:09.320
Come on, let's go find a Snipe.

21:09.326 --> 21:11.882
 Caitlyn, you can
only find Snipes in the woods.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.524
Then let's go to the forest.

21:13.530 --> 21:15.285
Why don't we play around here instead?

21:15.320 --> 21:17.721
You know, we could collect
some seashells or something.

21:17.756 --> 21:19.823
- Or we could have a race!
- The last one in the water...

21:19.858 --> 21:21.998
- Wait for me!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down!

21:22.004 --> 21:23.326
Hey, wait for me.

21:23.362 --> 21:24.653
Stop!

21:26.206 --> 21:28.573
Why don't we stay a little
further up on the beach, okay?

21:28.579 --> 21:30.967
But Dad lets us play in the
water whenever we want.

21:31.003 --> 21:32.369
I'm sure he does,

21:32.404 --> 21:33.959
but the waves are really big today,

21:33.965 --> 21:35.205
and the undertow's really strong.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.973
But we always go by ourselves.

21:37.009 --> 21:38.471
Sorry, not today.

21:38.477 --> 21:39.843
That's not fair.

21:40.078 --> 21:42.479
I know, but it's not safe, either.

21:42.514 --> 21:44.314
Let's just do something else.

21:44.349 --> 21:46.449
Fine, but it's not like you're our dad.

21:47.256 --> 21:49.653
Come on, let's go eat some brownies.

22:12.338 --> 22:13.404
Oh.

22:13.410 --> 22:14.831
Working on your book?

22:15.721 --> 22:17.721
David mentioned you're a novelist.

22:17.727 --> 22:18.954
Uh, well, does it count

22:18.960 --> 22:20.393
if it hasn't officially
been published yet?

22:20.428 --> 22:21.828
Uh, I'm so sorry...

22:21.863 --> 22:22.912
I didn't mean to interrupt.

22:22.918 --> 22:24.427
I didn't realize anyone was in here.

22:24.433 --> 22:25.665
What's it about?

22:25.907 --> 22:28.007
Uh, it's about a river trip

22:28.043 --> 22:30.510
and a ranch in Colorado
and woman in New York,

22:30.909 --> 22:33.902
but, really, it's more
about a messed-up family

22:33.908 --> 22:35.655
and a woman trying to
make sense of it all.

22:36.377 --> 22:38.844
It draws some parallels
to my own family.

22:39.919 --> 22:42.388
Well, no family is more
messed up than mine.

22:42.424 --> 22:43.723
My parents wrote the book

22:43.758 --> 22:45.391
on being disappointed by your children,

22:45.427 --> 22:47.293
which is why I hide in here.

22:47.329 --> 22:48.946
Ah, it's a nice place to hide.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.653
It was my safe place when my
parents would yell at David.

22:51.659 --> 22:52.992
I used to run

22:52.998 --> 22:54.665
to a bookstore near my house.

22:54.903 --> 22:58.071
It seems like they're pretty
happy with him now, though?

22:58.106 --> 23:00.506
"Seems like" is what my parents do best.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.877
The one thing you need
to know about my parents

23:03.912 --> 23:06.922
is the truth is almost
always the exact opposite.

23:08.692 --> 23:09.858
What do you mean?

23:10.082 --> 23:11.619
This weekend has nothing to

23:11.625 --> 23:13.388
do with getting to know Jess.

23:17.768 --> 23:20.568
Yeah, so my brother, Craig, called me

23:20.604 --> 23:23.571
because my dad got a
ticket for jaywalking,

23:23.607 --> 23:25.473
and he wanted to fight it.

23:25.509 --> 23:26.674
Was he guilty?

23:26.710 --> 23:28.959
Well, yeah! Totally!

23:28.965 --> 23:30.378
I mean, his argument

23:30.414 --> 23:32.380
was that he crossed the same street,

23:32.416 --> 23:33.848
the same way,

23:33.884 --> 23:35.183
every day for the last 40 years.

23:35.218 --> 23:37.819
That's smart! Establishing a precedent?

23:37.854 --> 23:40.221
Exactly, there's nothing
like admitting to a judge

23:40.257 --> 23:42.023
that you're a repeat offender.

23:42.059 --> 23:43.525
Hey, Danielle.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.993
I gotta ask you something.

23:45.028 --> 23:46.475
Um...

23:46.897 --> 23:49.130
You're not seeing someone else, are you?

23:51.064 --> 23:54.135
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't
have asked you that.

23:56.528 --> 23:58.973
Or maybe I should have.

24:01.462 --> 24:02.965
Connor...

24:03.213 --> 24:05.580
Do you remember Davis?

24:05.615 --> 24:07.849
That guy from undergrad?

24:07.884 --> 24:09.500
Yeah...

24:09.553 --> 24:12.267
Your... your ex-boyfriend.

24:14.185 --> 24:16.118
Last week,

24:16.200 --> 24:17.799
we had dinner.

24:20.764 --> 24:23.431
Okay, so you had dinner.

24:23.882 --> 24:25.567
Are you seeing him?

24:26.670 --> 24:28.203
Connor,

24:28.238 --> 24:30.438
if you want me to apologize
for having dinner...

24:30.474 --> 24:31.751
No, no. Hey, Danielle.

24:31.757 --> 24:32.899
Come on, you saying you had dinner

24:32.905 --> 24:34.147
with an old boyfriend is one thing,

24:34.177 --> 24:35.577
but you're not answering my question.

24:35.612 --> 24:38.046
- At least I deserve that.
- It's just... It's complicated.

24:38.081 --> 24:39.963
What's complicated?
My question's complicated,

24:39.969 --> 24:41.316
or what you're about to
tell me is complicated?

24:41.351 --> 24:42.717
Please don't lawyer me, okay?

24:42.752 --> 24:44.452
I really don't like
being cross-examined.

24:44.488 --> 24:45.568
I'm not, I just...

24:45.574 --> 24:47.222
I want to figure out what's going on.

24:47.257 --> 24:48.723
That's just it. I...

24:48.758 --> 24:50.725
I don't know. I...

24:51.345 --> 24:53.212
I don't know how I feel.

24:55.265 --> 24:56.798
About me?

24:59.301 --> 25:01.368
Yeah, about you...

25:01.771 --> 25:03.938
And about him,

25:03.974 --> 25:06.152
and mostly about me.

25:08.678 --> 25:10.111
Connor, I really like you,

25:10.147 --> 25:11.540
it's just that...

25:12.819 --> 25:14.115
I don't know.

25:14.151 --> 25:15.350
There's something...

25:15.385 --> 25:16.687
Not right?

25:18.655 --> 25:19.921
Yeah.

25:23.860 --> 25:25.360
Why didn't you tell me?

25:25.395 --> 25:27.295
You could've told me.

25:27.330 --> 25:29.164
I know.

25:31.134 --> 25:35.154
I think I just have to
figure it out on my own.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.161
I'm really sorry, Connor.

25:43.623 --> 25:46.347
Hey! Sally's only had six pies left...

25:46.383 --> 25:49.017
They had three apple, a peach, rhubarb,

25:49.052 --> 25:50.561
and banana cream,

25:50.567 --> 25:52.654
so we should be all good
for wine-and-cheese hour.

25:52.689 --> 25:54.055
Great!

25:54.090 --> 25:56.633
- You were right, by the way.
- About what?

25:56.639 --> 25:58.656
Oh, just about talking when
there's no reason to talk.

25:58.662 --> 25:59.950
There's no point.

25:59.956 --> 26:01.162
You and Connor?

26:01.198 --> 26:03.198
Yeah, so much for taking the high road.

26:03.233 --> 26:04.732
Ahh... I'm sorry, Kevin.

26:04.768 --> 26:06.334
You know, I apologized to him,

26:06.369 --> 26:08.432
and he literally just
threw it in my face.

26:08.438 --> 26:11.306
Yeah, I always have found
that apologies don't work

26:11.341 --> 26:13.551
unless a person wants to accept it.

26:13.557 --> 26:15.533
Yeah, well, I'm done saying sorry.

26:15.539 --> 26:16.644
So if this is the way things are

26:16.680 --> 26:18.913
between me and Connor, then fine.

26:18.949 --> 26:20.634
When did you learn how to bake?

26:20.640 --> 26:22.931
I told you. I'm a contractor.

26:27.379 --> 26:29.245
Hey! Jess, wait up.

26:29.251 --> 26:31.651
Um, hey, has David talked
about coming back with you?

26:31.657 --> 26:33.394
Yes, he's just looking
for the right time

26:33.430 --> 26:35.296
- to tell his parents.
- Okay, but does he think

26:35.332 --> 26:36.731
that his parents are
gonna be okay with it?

26:36.766 --> 26:37.903
Why wouldn't they be?

26:37.909 --> 26:39.100
It's why they invited me here,

26:39.135 --> 26:40.835
they wanted to meet
me before David left.

26:40.870 --> 26:43.204
Seriously, how cute is this outfit?

26:43.240 --> 26:44.606
Okay, never mind the outfit.

26:44.641 --> 26:45.940
I just talked to Alexandra,

26:45.976 --> 26:47.375
who is super-lovely, by the way, um,

26:47.410 --> 26:49.377
and she said that it is not an accident,

26:49.412 --> 26:51.913
that you're here, that you're
not here just to meet them...

26:51.948 --> 26:53.348
That they are planning something.

26:53.383 --> 26:55.450
I know... a party.

26:55.485 --> 26:58.219
Jess, you're not listening.

26:58.255 --> 26:59.554
Because I don't need to!

26:59.589 --> 27:02.290
They wouldn't be inviting me to
play a few "chukkas" of croquet

27:02.325 --> 27:03.858
if they were planning
to do anything to me.

27:03.893 --> 27:07.061
Bree, not everything in
life is like your novel.

27:07.097 --> 27:09.230
Not everyone is capable
of backstabbing betrayal.

27:09.266 --> 27:12.867
Okay, Jess. In my novel,
Kacie, who you are not,

27:12.902 --> 27:14.602
has one tragic flaw...

27:14.638 --> 27:16.037
Because she's been hurt

27:16.072 --> 27:17.405
by the people she loves the most.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.440
When people hurt her,
she shuts them out.

27:19.476 --> 27:21.182
Okay, I'm not shutting you out.

27:21.188 --> 27:22.587
Because you're not Kacie!

27:22.746 --> 27:23.986
I am!

27:25.115 --> 27:26.748
Jessica, there you are.

27:26.783 --> 27:28.902
Meet us at the east stables.

27:28.908 --> 27:30.952
Is David coming?

27:30.987 --> 27:33.712
He'll be on a call. It'll be just us.

27:34.294 --> 27:36.157
Sounds delightful.

27:36.192 --> 27:37.892
And Jess, "chukkas" is polo.

27:37.927 --> 27:39.502
What?

27:41.656 --> 27:42.743
Oh...

27:42.749 --> 27:43.814
Hi!

27:47.604 --> 27:49.137
So I heard you told Carrie and Caitlyn

27:49.172 --> 27:51.072
about snipe hunting?

27:51.107 --> 27:52.974
How do you know about snipes?

27:53.009 --> 27:55.033
And don't tell me it's
because you're a contractor.

27:55.039 --> 27:57.527
Oh, no. Snipes, 1840s,

27:57.533 --> 28:00.019
created by a Dr. Steven McLean.

28:00.050 --> 28:02.019
He had a summer camp in the Adirondacks.

28:02.025 --> 28:04.485
I took Kevin snipe-hunting
once, when he was a kid.

28:04.521 --> 28:06.187
He was out there for three hours

28:06.222 --> 28:08.191
searching for mythical creatures.

28:08.197 --> 28:09.991
- Well-played.
- Thank you.

28:10.026 --> 28:11.459
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

28:15.674 --> 28:18.675
Mick, don't take this the wrong way,

28:18.835 --> 28:21.969
but you've really mellowed out
since I was in high school.

28:22.005 --> 28:23.838
Maybe.

28:23.844 --> 28:25.606
Or maybe it's just that
the kids got older,

28:25.642 --> 28:27.404
and things got a little easier.

28:27.475 --> 28:30.011
And when it wasn't... easier?

28:30.046 --> 28:31.766
Well, you just...

28:31.772 --> 28:35.149
You just keep moving
forward, keep trying,

28:35.185 --> 28:37.919
and hope that the next
day's gonna be better.

28:39.189 --> 28:40.241
Thanks, Mick.

28:40.247 --> 28:41.513
For what?

28:41.519 --> 28:42.818
For the beer.

28:42.886 --> 28:44.886
Trace, don't take this the wrong way,

28:44.892 --> 28:46.890
but, um, you've actually

28:46.896 --> 28:48.329
mellowed out since high school, too.

28:49.833 --> 28:52.500
You're definitely right about that.

28:55.004 --> 28:57.238
We couldn't go on a snipe hunt

28:57.273 --> 28:59.387
since there's no such
thing as swimming snipes.

28:59.393 --> 29:01.644
- Oh...
- And there was an undertow.

29:01.650 --> 29:03.177
And Trace said we couldn't play.

29:03.213 --> 29:04.512
But Dad lets us.

29:04.547 --> 29:06.481
Well, it was probably a
good thing you didn't.

29:06.516 --> 29:08.015
But we can swim.

29:08.051 --> 29:09.650
And Trace isn't our dad.

29:10.079 --> 29:12.487
Well, yeah, I know that, but...

29:12.522 --> 29:14.961
But I guess undertows are bad.

29:15.592 --> 29:17.258
Yeah, did you... Did you talk to Trace

29:17.293 --> 29:18.826
about not being your dad?

29:18.862 --> 29:20.528
Yeah, but then we went inside

29:20.563 --> 29:21.763
and had our brownies.

29:21.798 --> 29:23.712
And they were really good.

29:36.446 --> 29:37.888
You're late.

29:38.224 --> 29:40.560
Oh, yeah, sorry. I had
to blow off some steam.

29:40.566 --> 29:43.010
Hey, do you mind taking my shift?
I've got to go see Danielle.

29:44.333 --> 29:45.866
Is everything all right?

29:45.901 --> 29:48.235
Yeah, Danielle and I are great.
We're totally great.

29:48.524 --> 29:49.655
Are you okay?

29:49.661 --> 29:52.873
Because you keep saying
those exact same words.

29:55.113 --> 29:56.585
Well, I have to convince Danielle

29:56.620 --> 29:57.949
that we're great.

29:58.390 --> 29:59.520
Ah.

30:00.562 --> 30:02.629
Tsk. Conn...

30:03.661 --> 30:04.993
Ever since you were little,

30:05.029 --> 30:06.561
you've had this great gift...

30:06.597 --> 30:09.498
You could convince anyone of anything.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.164
Your Dad and I used to laugh, because

30:12.170 --> 30:13.907
every time you got in trouble in school,

30:13.937 --> 30:16.271
you always managed to find a way out.

30:16.307 --> 30:17.939
Remember third grade?

30:17.975 --> 30:20.175
You managed to convince
your entire class

30:20.210 --> 30:21.687
that your teacher was an alien.

30:21.693 --> 30:24.413
Mrs. Spelling? She was
definitely an alien.

30:26.956 --> 30:28.583
Honey...

30:28.619 --> 30:32.521
Just because you can
convince others of something

30:32.556 --> 30:34.523
doesn't mean you have to work so hard

30:34.558 --> 30:36.182
trying to convince yourself.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.827
If it's not right with
you and Danielle...

30:38.862 --> 30:40.229
Trust me...

30:40.422 --> 30:42.609
Don't pretend it is.

30:44.168 --> 30:46.435
You deserve amazing.

30:48.472 --> 30:49.771
Thanks, Mom.

30:49.807 --> 30:51.157
Mm.

30:58.315 --> 31:01.183
I hope you're having a
good time, Jessica.

31:01.218 --> 31:04.152
Oh, yes. Just delightful.

31:04.507 --> 31:07.675
I didn't know that horses were so...

31:07.923 --> 31:09.324
Big.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.692
And fast.

31:10.728 --> 31:12.160
They're deceiving.

31:12.196 --> 31:13.295
Mm-hmm.

31:13.330 --> 31:14.863
I'm sorry that you haven't been able

31:14.898 --> 31:17.199
to see much of David, considering.

31:17.234 --> 31:19.134
No, that's okay.

31:19.169 --> 31:20.836
So, I thought I would
take you to see him now.

31:20.871 --> 31:22.371
He's working in the office.

31:22.406 --> 31:24.172
Oh, I'd like that.

31:24.505 --> 31:27.744
So, what does David actually
do at your auberge?

31:28.033 --> 31:30.145
Well, a lot of everything, actually.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.414
He, um, he helps out with the gardening

31:32.449 --> 31:35.050
and housekeeping and cooking, of course.

31:35.085 --> 31:36.718
Sounds like he does it all.

31:36.754 --> 31:39.054
He can, and he does.

31:39.461 --> 31:41.575
I don't really know how...

31:42.259 --> 31:43.992
He's taught me a lot.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.094
Well, he did go to Lawrenceville

31:46.100 --> 31:47.399
and Harvard.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.997
Mm. Don't forget le Cordon Bleu.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.166
Well, yes, there's that.

31:51.201 --> 31:53.778
So, what is his
speciality for breakfast?

31:53.784 --> 31:55.871
Oh, David makes

31:55.906 --> 31:58.273
the best quiche in the whole world.

31:58.308 --> 31:59.541
Quiche?

31:59.576 --> 32:00.742
That's quite impressive.

32:00.778 --> 32:02.621
... The singularity comes
with two implications,

32:02.627 --> 32:04.613
both based on exponential progressions,

32:04.648 --> 32:06.014
not linear.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.216
I'm proposing a four-fold increase

32:08.252 --> 32:09.551
in capital expenditure

32:09.586 --> 32:12.099
based on biological and
hardware advances.

32:12.589 --> 32:15.857
So tell me a little bit
more about this quiche.

32:18.295 --> 32:20.829
Jessica, are you okay?

32:30.887 --> 32:33.141
Mr. Mayor...

32:33.177 --> 32:35.911
I'm not going to tell you again

32:35.946 --> 32:38.547
how important this fountain is to me.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.499
Good, because it didn't work.

32:40.505 --> 32:43.506
But let me explain

32:43.954 --> 32:45.954
why the fountain

32:45.989 --> 32:47.789
is so important to you.

32:47.825 --> 32:49.825
Nell... what's your point?

32:49.860 --> 32:51.493
The wish fountain isn't about my past,

32:51.528 --> 32:52.961
it's not about your past.

32:53.487 --> 32:56.631
It's for all the people who
come here and toss in a coin,

32:56.667 --> 32:59.028
to make a wish for a better future.

32:59.034 --> 33:01.169
It's about hopes, it's about dreams.

33:01.175 --> 33:04.139
It's a place of wishes, possibilities,

33:04.174 --> 33:05.640
and if we take it away from them,

33:05.676 --> 33:07.044
then what do they have left?

33:07.050 --> 33:09.110
I still don't know what
this has to do with me.

33:09.146 --> 33:10.358
Well...

33:11.014 --> 33:12.647
My husband, Charles,

33:12.683 --> 33:14.601
and my son, Mick,

33:14.607 --> 33:16.518
they played a big, important role

33:16.553 --> 33:19.254
in developing Chesapeake Shores.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.156
Now, I know you don't
want to talk to me,

33:21.191 --> 33:25.360
but do you really want to battle

33:25.605 --> 33:28.689
all the people in this town

33:28.695 --> 33:31.252
who were involved in building it?

33:32.669 --> 33:36.374
You know, maybe, especially
in an election year,

33:36.380 --> 33:38.254
this might really be a good

33:38.260 --> 33:40.549
time to make a wish, Mr. Mayor.

33:50.196 --> 33:52.230
What did you wish for?

33:52.584 --> 33:54.322
Well...

33:54.358 --> 33:56.130
That the fountain would always

33:56.136 --> 33:58.085
be a part of Chesapeake Shores.

34:11.275 --> 34:12.732
Yes!

34:14.635 --> 34:17.574
So I basically spent the
entire day trying to convince

34:17.580 --> 34:19.297
these two C.E.O.s who hate each other

34:19.304 --> 34:20.916
that they should merge their companies

34:20.951 --> 34:22.417
and spend the next 20 years

34:22.452 --> 34:23.685
being profitable together.

34:23.719 --> 34:24.873
How'd that go?

34:24.880 --> 34:27.188
Well, they can agree on one thing.

34:27.224 --> 34:28.924
They hate each other equally.

34:28.958 --> 34:30.992
Sounds like progress.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.386
Mm-hmm.

34:34.569 --> 34:36.231
Hey, Trace?

34:36.266 --> 34:37.831
Um, I know what

34:37.868 --> 34:39.234
the girls said to you last night.

34:39.433 --> 34:40.768
What do you mean?

34:40.860 --> 34:42.822
About you not being their dad.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.456
Abby, it wasn't a big deal.

34:48.277 --> 34:49.645
I feel like it was,

34:49.650 --> 34:51.754
and I'm sorry that
they said that to you.

34:51.760 --> 34:52.914
It's fine.

34:52.949 --> 34:54.382
It's what they were feeling.

34:54.418 --> 34:56.284
And considering everything...

34:56.802 --> 34:58.186
I get it.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.688
It's got to be confusing for them.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.211
Yeah.

35:02.259 --> 35:05.585
I think we're all just trying
to figure out how this works.

35:25.482 --> 35:28.228
Quiche is so beneath him.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.453
What?

35:30.459 --> 35:32.921
I can't believe he would
ever choose quiche.

35:35.521 --> 35:37.221
Okay, so we're talking again?

35:38.192 --> 35:40.142
Okay, I'm not saying I forgive you,

35:40.148 --> 35:42.027
but this house is full of Pecks

35:42.033 --> 35:43.828
and I need an O'Brien right now,

35:43.834 --> 35:45.400
and you're the best one to talk to...

35:45.846 --> 35:47.769
Well, at least in the top two,

35:48.088 --> 35:49.187
most of the time.

35:49.193 --> 35:50.403
It's all a mess.

35:50.409 --> 35:53.675
And your book, which, clearly,
I didn't understand...

35:53.710 --> 35:55.310
No, I think you understood it perfectly.

35:55.345 --> 35:56.778
But Kacie's you,

35:56.813 --> 35:59.450
and I thought she was me, because...

35:59.943 --> 36:02.817
- She kind of is.
- Because, Jess...

36:02.853 --> 36:05.120
We both had somebody leave us.

36:06.223 --> 36:07.822
So we're both Kacie.

36:07.858 --> 36:09.024
We can share Kacie.

36:09.059 --> 36:10.992
Yeah, or maybe neither of us are.

36:11.826 --> 36:13.671
We've both grown so much.

36:13.677 --> 36:15.348
I mean, Jess, look at you.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.134
I'm sorry I got so mad at you.

36:19.854 --> 36:21.954
I think I'm just more mad at myself

36:21.960 --> 36:24.005
because I didn't even think
about what you lost.

36:24.954 --> 36:26.242
Thank you.

36:27.484 --> 36:28.736
Do you know what, though?

36:30.294 --> 36:32.761
Kacie isn't nearly as
amazing as Jess O'Brien.

36:33.945 --> 36:35.245
Just ask David Peck.

36:35.490 --> 36:37.657
You know what?

36:37.793 --> 36:40.369
Kacie isn't nearly as
amazing as Bree O'Brien.

36:40.619 --> 36:42.719
Just ask Simon Atwater.

36:42.725 --> 36:45.791
Oh! Come on. I don't even
know where that's at.

36:46.563 --> 36:47.767
Do you know what, though?

36:48.497 --> 36:50.398
We shouldn't be giving anybody the power

36:50.434 --> 36:51.900
to tell us how amazing we are.

36:51.935 --> 36:54.569
We are amazing because we're amazing!

36:54.604 --> 36:56.170
No matter what anybody says! Right?

36:56.176 --> 36:58.239
- Right.
- Yeah. Amazing?

36:58.275 --> 36:59.640
- Quiche.
- What? No. No, no.

36:59.646 --> 37:00.742
The quiche!

37:00.777 --> 37:03.144
No, David. David runs
million-dollar companies.

37:03.180 --> 37:05.413
He uses words like "singularity"

37:05.449 --> 37:08.192
and "exponential" and "conglomerates,"

37:08.198 --> 37:10.051
and he talks to Paris and Berlin...

37:10.087 --> 37:12.120
And he loves... you.

37:19.896 --> 37:20.929
One more thing.

37:20.964 --> 37:22.464
All right.

37:28.819 --> 37:30.152
Olive oil?

37:30.402 --> 37:32.540
I couldn't find a branch.

37:41.863 --> 37:43.683
Are you going to make a wish?

37:43.689 --> 37:45.856
As a matter of fact, I am.

37:45.862 --> 37:46.974
Well, here.

37:46.980 --> 37:48.448
Thank you.

37:54.753 --> 37:56.385
What did you wish for?

37:56.955 --> 37:58.417
Understanding.

37:58.994 --> 38:00.890
Nell, I don't have a problem...

38:00.926 --> 38:02.091
Well, now, honestly,

38:02.127 --> 38:03.993
this wish isn't for you, it's for me.

38:05.030 --> 38:06.313
Robin...

38:06.319 --> 38:07.757
I, uh...

38:09.801 --> 38:12.702
I really want to say that I'm sorry.

38:13.305 --> 38:14.916
All my life,

38:15.026 --> 38:17.660
I've been fighting for
what I believe in,

38:17.906 --> 38:20.127
I've been fighting to save my family,

38:20.133 --> 38:21.602
to keep 'em together,

38:21.608 --> 38:23.534
and, sometimes, I forget

38:23.570 --> 38:24.869
to ask myself

38:24.904 --> 38:27.105
what is best for other people.

38:27.351 --> 38:29.087
So, you don't think that we're

38:29.093 --> 38:31.286
making a mistake, renewing our vows?

38:31.292 --> 38:34.412
Well... people have to
find their own way.

38:34.447 --> 38:35.476
All of us.

38:35.482 --> 38:37.727
I'm still trying to find mine!

38:37.897 --> 38:40.251
And I think that you and Thomas,

38:40.286 --> 38:42.573
you have to find your own path.

38:42.916 --> 38:44.022
But...

38:44.752 --> 38:48.661
I do have one little, bitty request...

38:49.625 --> 38:52.659
Weddings are all about family,

38:53.500 --> 38:55.829
and I think that you and Thomas

38:56.124 --> 38:57.926
should be with yours.

39:01.608 --> 39:04.743
We would love to renew
our vows here, Nell.

39:04.749 --> 39:07.570
Oh, Robin! Oh, bless you.

39:07.576 --> 39:09.769
Oh, bless you, child.

39:09.775 --> 39:11.732
- Bless you.
- Yes.

39:12.732 --> 39:15.053
_

39:20.510 --> 39:22.010
Hey, Danielle?

39:22.045 --> 39:23.245
Do you have a second?

39:23.493 --> 39:25.870
Connor, what are you doing here?

39:25.876 --> 39:27.115
I was in the neighborhood.

39:27.652 --> 39:29.619
Okay, I wasn't remotely
in the neighborhood,

39:29.654 --> 39:31.654
but I wanted to talk
to you one more time.

39:32.066 --> 39:35.024
And the truth is, I had
this entire speech planned

39:35.060 --> 39:36.626
to convince you that
we're great together,

39:36.661 --> 39:37.961
that you should give us another shot.

39:37.996 --> 39:39.596
But, hey, Danielle...

39:40.799 --> 39:41.961
Look.

39:42.367 --> 39:44.820
You've been a good friend...

39:45.335 --> 39:47.702
You've been a great friend.

39:49.074 --> 39:50.540
But I realized, you know,

39:50.575 --> 39:52.142
with everything that's been going on,

39:52.177 --> 39:54.218
you know, my dad and Uncle Thomas...

39:55.380 --> 39:56.875
I think I just...

39:57.849 --> 39:59.382
Wanted something stable,

40:00.042 --> 40:02.175
and maybe I pushed too hard,

40:02.181 --> 40:03.953
too fast, and that wasn't fair.

40:05.114 --> 40:06.656
It's fine, Connor.

40:06.691 --> 40:08.191
The truth is...

40:09.428 --> 40:11.861
I don't even know where we are,

40:12.665 --> 40:14.667
but what I do know

40:14.766 --> 40:16.366
is that I want you to be happy.

40:16.401 --> 40:19.302
Well, yeah, I mean, I want
you to be happy, too.

40:19.337 --> 40:22.196
And I get what we need to do,

40:22.664 --> 40:24.798
and whatever happens after...

40:24.804 --> 40:26.541
I just want you to know,

40:27.613 --> 40:29.112
I'm okay with that.

40:30.035 --> 40:32.035
Thank you.

40:39.057 --> 40:40.757
Who knows, right?

40:40.792 --> 40:42.025
Yeah.

40:43.528 --> 40:45.562
So I guess I'll see you around?

40:46.535 --> 40:47.868
I hope so.

40:49.183 --> 40:51.083
See you.

41:03.915 --> 41:06.936
Bree, I, uh, talked to
Steve Kennedy today.

41:06.942 --> 41:08.084
From Harper Day?

41:08.119 --> 41:10.335
Yes, the, uh, the Editor-in-Chief.

41:10.341 --> 41:11.955
We've known each other forever.

41:11.990 --> 41:13.756
He asked me to wish you well,

41:13.792 --> 41:15.892
he's very excited about your novel.

41:15.927 --> 41:17.227
Oh.

41:17.262 --> 41:18.761
That is exciting.

41:18.797 --> 41:21.030
You must be very proud, Jessica.

41:21.503 --> 41:24.871
My sister is a very talented writer.

41:25.604 --> 41:27.495
Alexandra? David?

41:27.501 --> 41:29.606
I would like to thank both of you

41:29.641 --> 41:32.242
for helping me with the company
these past few months.

41:32.277 --> 41:35.683
Your-Your work has been
a tremendous asset to me

41:35.689 --> 41:38.314
and to Peck Enterprises while I was ill.

41:38.350 --> 41:39.716
Thank you.

41:40.435 --> 41:41.918
So...

41:41.953 --> 41:43.920
I think the time feels right,

41:43.955 --> 41:46.222
amongst family and friends,

41:46.258 --> 41:48.791
to finally do the right
thing for the company

41:48.827 --> 41:50.248
and this family.

41:51.429 --> 41:53.429
Good luck running the company.

41:53.465 --> 41:54.993
Well deserved, sis.

41:56.101 --> 41:57.619
David,

41:57.625 --> 42:00.370
you are the new C.E.O.
of Peck Enterprises.

42:01.172 --> 42:02.572
You're kidding me.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.886
Not in front of the guests.

42:05.892 --> 42:07.914
Dad, we talked about this.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.679
No need to discuss it now.

42:09.714 --> 42:11.623
You should discuss is with Jessica.

42:11.629 --> 42:14.672
I know you'll do what's best
for you and the family.

42:17.581 --> 42:19.355
Ahem. You know,

42:19.391 --> 42:20.857
I read Bree's first play,

42:20.892 --> 42:22.625
Meditations From the Second Floor...

42:22.661 --> 42:24.527
The ending is so poetic.

42:24.837 --> 42:27.096
Oh, well, thank you so much.

42:27.132 --> 42:29.299
Not very many people understand it.

42:29.334 --> 42:31.834
Yeah, that's what makes it so great...

42:31.870 --> 42:33.970
The lack of pretension and calculation.

42:37.816 --> 42:39.082
Well...

42:39.088 --> 42:40.977
I can't wait to eat.

42:41.012 --> 42:43.513
Jessica and I were
bonding this afternoon

42:43.548 --> 42:45.648
while David was at work,

42:45.887 --> 42:48.320
and it inspired tonight's dinner menu.

42:54.691 --> 42:55.950
Quiche.

43:05.103 --> 43:06.790
So, what are we doing?

43:06.796 --> 43:09.639
We are waiting for the
rest of our hunting party.

43:09.674 --> 43:10.873
And there they are!

43:10.909 --> 43:13.042
So, what are we doing?

43:13.078 --> 43:14.978
Carrie already asked that.

43:15.013 --> 43:17.213
Oh. Did you get an answer?

43:17.248 --> 43:18.982
No. Grandpa?

43:19.017 --> 43:20.183
Don't look at me.

43:20.218 --> 43:21.851
I just own the joint. No idea.

43:21.886 --> 43:24.153
Well, since this is my last day in town

43:24.189 --> 43:25.321
before I head back to tour...

43:25.357 --> 43:26.682
And since you girls are about to

43:26.688 --> 43:28.096
go spend the week with your dad,

43:28.126 --> 43:29.892
we wanted to do something very special.

43:29.928 --> 43:32.876
So... we consulted the Creature Almanac.

43:32.882 --> 43:34.430
And it turns out

43:34.466 --> 43:36.399
this is the perfect afternoon...

43:36.434 --> 43:38.201
For snipe-hunting!

43:39.343 --> 43:40.675
- Not again.
- Yes, again.

43:40.681 --> 43:43.003
- Throw me a snipe caller!
- Ta-dah!

43:43.009 --> 43:44.304
Nice throw, Mom.

43:44.320 --> 43:46.135
Mick? You want to do the honors?

43:46.141 --> 43:47.373
Oh, I do, I do!

43:47.379 --> 43:50.932
Let the snipe hunt... begin!

43:51.997 --> 43:53.121
Come on, girls!

43:53.156 --> 43:54.422
Okay, now, listen,

43:54.457 --> 43:55.790
let's stick together this time.

43:55.825 --> 43:57.406
Yeah, but that's what you said

43:57.412 --> 43:59.045
last time, Dad, and then I...

44:00.564 --> 44:03.264
Come on, snipes! Yoo-hoo!

44:03.300 --> 44:04.966
Snipes! Yoo-hoo!

44:05.001 --> 44:07.602
So... girls are going
to Wes's for the week?

44:07.637 --> 44:08.836
Yeah.

44:09.858 --> 44:11.606
And...

44:11.641 --> 44:14.505
My two C.E.O.s who hate each other

44:14.511 --> 44:16.140
are suddenly best friends.

44:16.146 --> 44:18.464
Seems like you might have
some extra time, then.

44:18.470 --> 44:20.779
Yes. Seems so.

44:21.246 --> 44:22.846
I'm not ready to say goodbye yet.

44:22.852 --> 44:25.119
Well, maybe we don't have to.

44:25.488 --> 44:27.322
Come on!
