WEBVTT

00:05.089 --> 00:07.421
[panting]

00:32.241 --> 00:35.199
[man] And now, dancing on stage three,

00:35.286 --> 00:39.199
the pride of St. Paul, Corvette!

00:39.290 --> 00:41.372
[J‘ Wreckx-N-Effect: Rump Shaker]

00:41.459 --> 00:44.121
[cheering and whistling]

01:15.910 --> 01:17.992
[song continues, muffled]

01:20.831 --> 01:24.415
No! That's the money for the orphanage!

01:24.502 --> 01:27.665
That means, Mr. LaShade,
you're The Cobra.

01:28.339 --> 01:30.876
Sorry, baby. It's just business.

01:30.967 --> 01:34.425
- All this time, it was you.
- Pretty and smart.

01:34.512 --> 01:36.048
What a shame.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.347
Razzle Dazzle! Hyah!

01:52.029 --> 01:54.941
Autumn, Crystal, bad news.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.865
Corvette was working for the Cobra.

01:59.370 --> 02:02.737
But fear not, he will pay.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.282
[man] And, cut!

02:05.376 --> 02:06.365
[bell rings]

02:06.460 --> 02:08.621
- [man 2] Check the gate.
- [man 3] Checking.

02:08.713 --> 02:11.204
- Let me give you a hand.
- Oh, thank you.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.631
Billy Dee, it was so great
working with you.

02:13.718 --> 02:15.458
No, no, the pleasure was all mine.

02:15.553 --> 02:17.009
- You're sweet.
- Take care.

02:17.096 --> 02:18.461
You too.

02:18.556 --> 02:21.423
All right, that's a series wrap
for Corvette!

02:21.976 --> 02:24.638
- Let's hear it for Nikki!
- [man 1] Well done, lass.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.310
- Well done, Nikki.
- Thank you.

02:26.397 --> 02:27.978
- [woman] On ya, Nikki!
- Thanks.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.896
Brilliant, Nikki, as always.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.479
You know, you don't need to die.

02:35.573 --> 02:39.441
Well, we could say that, uh, Corvette
was wearing a bulletproof vest.

02:42.747 --> 02:44.533
Bulletproof breast?

02:45.333 --> 02:49.042
Look, I'm just a guest star.
We all know what happens to guest stars.

02:49.128 --> 02:51.084
Now that your work's done here,

02:51.172 --> 02:54.505
I suppose you'll be leaving Sydney
and heading back to LA?

02:54.592 --> 02:56.958
No, I'm not leaving Sydney.

02:57.053 --> 02:58.463
I love you.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.094
I love you, too.

03:07.355 --> 03:08.765
[chuckles]

03:10.107 --> 03:13.599
Son of a bitch!
All right, come on, let's go, one more.

03:13.694 --> 03:17.312
- You said best out of five.
- Well, now we're going best of seven.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.406
[Nikki panting]

03:23.287 --> 03:24.527
[groans]

03:25.331 --> 03:27.117
Uh... Are you OK?

03:33.631 --> 03:35.872
- What happened?
- [strained] Pa... lyz...

03:36.592 --> 03:38.799
- What'd the hell she say?
- I don't know.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.127
Let's get her some water!
Get help!

03:52.650 --> 03:54.891
What are you doing?
Get moving!

03:55.903 --> 03:57.313
Dude...

03:58.823 --> 04:00.484
...Nikki's dead.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.484
Who the hell's Nikki?

04:23.347 --> 04:25.338
[classical music playing]

04:27.351 --> 04:31.344
Mmm. Howie, the frittata is amazing.

04:32.565 --> 04:35.398
It's my new chef.
He's fantastic.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.442
- Paulo, come in here.
- Yes, sir?

04:38.529 --> 04:41.271
Paulo, my boy, you have a new fan.

04:41.365 --> 04:44.402
- I'd like you to meet Nikki.
- The food is amazing.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.358
You're too kind.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.321
The secret is the, urn, shaved truffles.

04:50.207 --> 04:54.075
- Luckily for you they're in season.
- You know, you should ask for a raise.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.330
[chuckles]

04:58.007 --> 04:59.622
Excuse me.

04:59.717 --> 05:02.379
He just came to Sydney.
Heard l was hiring

05:02.470 --> 05:05.758
and showed up at my office every day
until I gave him the job.

05:06.891 --> 05:08.472
Apparently, back home,

05:09.018 --> 05:13.728
- he's the Wolfgang Puck of Brazil.
- Wow.

05:15.524 --> 05:19.062
Here. Try one of these homemade rolls.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.064
Please. Please, do.

05:28.037 --> 05:32.622
Oh, it's beautiful.
Howie, you shouldn't have.

05:33.417 --> 05:36.375
I realize, of course, it's not a ring.
Not yet.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.036
But, uh, when my wife...

05:40.341 --> 05:42.332
[gasping]

05:43.385 --> 05:45.546
Paulo. Paulo!

05:46.805 --> 05:48.796
[grunting]

05:59.318 --> 06:01.058
He is gone.

06:16.418 --> 06:19.160
I would have loved if you could have
figured out a way

06:19.255 --> 06:21.712
where I didn't have to eat
the same food as him.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.049
Nobody else knows about this thing?

06:26.136 --> 06:28.468
Everything in here is way off the books.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.643
- What?
- Ashes are evidence, Paulo.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.642
We poisoned him.
Let's not poison ourselves.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.157
[sighs]

06:54.873 --> 06:57.034
Razzle frickin' dazzle.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.919
- [Charlie] What happened?
- We don't know.

07:02.506 --> 07:06.374
She's got no gunshot wound, knife wound,
no polar bear bite, nothing.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.596
- Maybe it was something she ate.
- Maybe she was poisoned.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.592
[Sun] We should check the food
to see if anyone else is sick.

07:12.683 --> 07:15.550
She's got gunk under her fingernails.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.432
- Where did you find her?
- Right here.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.935
She stumbled out of the jungle,
face planted,

07:22.026 --> 07:26.269
said something like "plywood,"
and then, sayonara.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.570
Actually, I think
she said "power lines."

07:28.657 --> 07:31.945
Who the hell knows what she said?
She was five seconds from dying.

07:32.036 --> 07:35.403
- Seeing light at the end of the tunnel.
- "Paulo lies."

07:35.497 --> 07:38.284
That's what she said, not "power lines."
"Paulo lies."

07:38.375 --> 07:42.084
- Who the hell's Paulo?
- Paulo's her... husband.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.708
Or her boyfriend. Or whatever.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.335
- They live down the beach.
- Where the hell is he?

07:47.426 --> 07:50.338
'Cause if he lies,
that might be a good place to start.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.257
"English expat Howard L. Zuckerman,

07:56.352 --> 07:58.718
the creative force behind such hit shows

07:58.812 --> 08:03.727
as Expose, Strike Team Alpha,
and Dr. Kincaid, Esquire,

08:03.817 --> 08:07.480
was found dead in his palatial
Sydney estate from heart failure."

08:16.038 --> 08:17.403
Are you chewing gum?

08:22.628 --> 08:24.084
Nicotine gum.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.333
I quit.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.260
A toast.
To our new life together.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.928
Cheers.

08:35.265 --> 08:40.510
There's nowhere to sit.
No tables, no chairs, nothing.

08:40.604 --> 08:41.764
Good call, Boone.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.856
- You want a chair from the restaurant?
- Forget it. Let's leave.

08:45.943 --> 08:49.902
You screwed up seats in first class.
Why would you be able to find them here?

08:49.988 --> 08:52.479
- Can I have this chair, please?
- Yeah.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.410
- Be my guest.
- Boone, let's just go!

08:56.787 --> 08:59.199
- Thanks, anyway.
- Boone!

08:59.289 --> 09:00.574
I'm coming, Shannon.

09:00.666 --> 09:04.284
If you quit flirting with random guys
maybe we could get on the plane.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.499
Promise me we'll never end up like them.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.213
I promise.

09:14.304 --> 09:18.798
[woman] Paging Captain Stewart,
please pick up a courtesy call.

09:20.144 --> 09:22.726
[screaming]

09:30.362 --> 09:32.148
Boone!

09:32.990 --> 09:34.400
Boone!

09:35.576 --> 09:39.364
Boone!
Please! I need help!

09:39.455 --> 09:41.616
Help me!

10:00.851 --> 10:03.092
Hey, hey!
Get away from there!

10:03.187 --> 10:05.018
Hey, get back! Get down!

10:05.105 --> 10:07.346
- Get away from there!
- [jet engine revving]

10:18.869 --> 10:20.951
[indistinct screaming]

10:24.082 --> 10:26.118
[sobbing]

10:26.210 --> 10:29.122
- Paulo!
- Are we alive?

10:29.213 --> 10:32.046
Did we survive?
Look at me. Am | OK?

10:32.132 --> 10:35.465
- Am I OK?
- Hey, do you have a pen?

10:35.552 --> 10:37.588
- Do you have a pen?
- A pen?

10:37.679 --> 10:39.965
Hey, does anybody have a pen?

10:48.398 --> 10:50.309
[electrical crackling]

10:50.400 --> 10:52.812
Paulo? Paulo!

10:52.903 --> 10:55.269
- Are you OK?
- [panting] Yeah.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.989
- I think so.
- Baby, look at me.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.282
Look at me.

11:01.537 --> 11:04.950
- Where's the bag?
- What?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.201
The bag! Paulo, where is it?

11:12.548 --> 11:15.005
[Sawyer] I'm telling you,
this is the trail.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.083
[Hurley] What do you
know about tracking?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.964
- [Sawyer] I know what a footprint is.
- [Jin] Over here.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.346
Whoa.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.392
[sighs] I'm guessing that's Paulo.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.651
He's just like Nikki.
No wound, nothing.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.403
[speaking in Korean]

11:42.494 --> 11:46.112
Yeah, I know.
Why are his pants undone?

11:47.457 --> 11:50.995
- And why is his shoe in that tree?
- Maybe he stepped on something.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.377
[Hurley] You see something?

11:58.468 --> 12:00.004
Sawyer?

12:00.637 --> 12:02.138
Nothing.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.797
No!

12:06.143 --> 12:07.633
Don't.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.062
Dude, what are you doing?

12:13.150 --> 12:15.482
You ever think
they might have been poisoned?

12:15.569 --> 12:18.732
That's evidence.
u i u i .
Yo 're mess n the cr me scene

12:18.822 --> 12:20.403
"Crime scene?"

12:20.490 --> 12:23.106
- Is there a forensics hatch?
- Stop!

12:25.203 --> 12:26.283
Monster.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.661
How many times do l have to tell you,
there's no such thing as monsters.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.336
Maybe it was a dinosaur.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.507
It's not Jurassic Park, Paulo.
It's the South Pacific.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.085
Then what was it?
You saw the trees move.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.758
Would you start focusing?

12:45.849 --> 12:49.558
We've been here for six days.
The Coast Guard will be here any second.

12:49.645 --> 12:53.604
And I don't think they're gonna take,
"I'm looking for my script bag"

12:53.690 --> 12:56.523
as an excuse
for not getting on the rescue boat.

12:56.610 --> 13:01.445
Hey! Did you guys lose your luggage?
Yeah, I lost mine, too.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.396
I found some other stuff, though.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.359
So if you need anything...
pants, or a sweatshirt...

13:07.371 --> 13:09.657
...I can help you find some that fit.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.615
l'm Ethan, by the way.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.827
Hi, I'm Nikki
and this is Paulo.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.584
- Hi.
- And you're so sweet, Ethan.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.587
But, actually,
we're not looking for clothes.

13:22.678 --> 13:25.511
Yeah, see, Paulo here
lost his nicotine gum.

13:25.597 --> 13:29.385
- Ouch. Might have luck looking inland.
- In the jungle?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.558
The plane split apart over the island,

13:31.645 --> 13:34.637
so some of the stuff
might have rained down in there.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.108
Boone! Boone took the water.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.979
- [Boone] No one would have understood.
- What is going on?

13:40.070 --> 13:43.437
Someone had to take responsibility.
40 would have never lasted!

13:43.532 --> 13:45.113
[Jack] Leave him alone!

13:49.162 --> 13:50.777
It's been six days.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.243
We're all still waiting
for someone to come.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.617
We have to stop waiting.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.959
We need to start figuring things out.

14:03.093 --> 14:06.051
Now, I found water, fresh water,
up in the valley.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.724
I'll take in a group at first light.

14:10.225 --> 14:13.809
If you don't want to come,
then find another way to contribute.

14:15.105 --> 14:18.347
Because every man for himself
is not gonna work.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.775
But if we can't live together,

14:26.116 --> 14:28.027
we're gonna die alone.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.034
[Hurley] I'm with Jin. It's the monster.

14:35.125 --> 14:38.162
- Because that makes the most sense.
- It does.

14:38.253 --> 14:41.745
Locke said when Eko died,
his last words were "you're next."

14:41.840 --> 14:43.831
And Nikki and Paulo were with them.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.341
He was talking about them.

14:46.428 --> 14:49.215
He wasn't saying "you're next"
about them.

14:49.306 --> 14:52.719
He was sayin' "you're next"
as in, you're all next.

14:52.809 --> 14:58.054
- Yeah, that's not really better.
- All right. So here's how I see it.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.729
We want to know what happened,

14:59.816 --> 15:02.728
we gotta find out whatever we can
about these jabonies.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.151
- "Jabonies?"
- Nina and Pablo.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.739
Dude, show some respect.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.155
You know their names.
lt's Nikki and Paulo.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.275
Whatever, Hugo.
Where's their tent?

15:13.288 --> 15:15.529
And we better get some shovels.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.509
Hey, Dr. Arzt.

15:27.344 --> 15:30.051
- Oh, hi.
- You're a scientist, right?

15:30.889 --> 15:32.925
And an educator, yes.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.352
What are you doing with all this stuff?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.768
Since we got here
I discovered 20 new species.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.561
I'll be the next Charles Danivin.

15:41.316 --> 15:45.559
[stammering] That is Latrodectus regina.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.736
Very dangerous.

15:47.823 --> 15:51.611
They call her the Medusa spider.
Her pheromones are very strong.

15:51.701 --> 15:55.535
One whiff and every male of the species
would be here in seconds.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.954
Not unlike you, I guess.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.951
So, you're probably too busy
to help me, then?

16:02.045 --> 16:05.208
No, no, not at all. I'm fine.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.913
I can help.
What can I do you for?

16:07.008 --> 16:09.340
Well, I'm trying to find my luggage,

16:09.427 --> 16:12.635
and since the plane broke apart
over the jungle,

16:12.722 --> 16:16.590
l was wondering if you knew about
trajectories and stuff?

16:16.685 --> 16:20.724
[chuckling]
Do I know about trajectories?

16:21.439 --> 16:23.896
Allow me to draw you a map, Madame.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.063
Are you sure we should listen
to a high school teacher?

16:31.158 --> 16:33.524
Junior high, and yes.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.659
What's your problem with Leslie, anyway?

16:36.746 --> 16:39.783
- Leslie?
- [chuckles] You're jealous.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.911
Of him? [scoffs] Never.

16:42.002 --> 16:46.496
Yeah, his spiders turn me on so much
I had to sleep with him to get the map.

16:46.590 --> 16:49.457
I wouldn't be surprised.
You slept with Zuckerman.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.756
I did that for us.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.466
OK. I'm sorry, ljust...

16:59.561 --> 17:01.517
I don't trust that guy.

17:01.605 --> 17:04.312
We should have gone to Ethan.
He would have helped.

17:04.399 --> 17:05.764
Paulo, look.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.064
[Paulo] Another plane.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.648
- It's been here awhile.
- Go up there.

17:14.743 --> 17:17.280
- Maybe there's a radio.
- Are you insane?

17:17.370 --> 17:20.282
If I go up there
that thing's gonna fall.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.659
- You're not gonna fall.
- What?

17:22.751 --> 17:24.537
You want me to die?

17:24.628 --> 17:26.914
Come on. Let's keep going.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.792
What is that?

17:45.982 --> 17:47.518
- [creaking]
- [gaSping]

17:52.781 --> 17:54.271
OK, let's do it.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.325
- Let's check it out.
- [Nikki] Whoa.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.867
So, our carry-on bag
fell from the sky,

18:06.962 --> 18:10.705
opened a manhole, crawled inside
and closed the doors behind itself?

18:10.799 --> 18:14.917
You don't want to climb up to a plane,
but now you want to climb down a ladder

18:15.011 --> 18:16.717
into a dark tunnel.

18:17.472 --> 18:18.973
I don't think so.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.602
Hey, man, be careful.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.355
Why? They don't live here anymore.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.273
[Charlie] So, Sun checked the food.

18:31.361 --> 18:34.148
They're eating the same as us
and no one else is sick.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.481
- Could be a virus.
- Dude.

18:37.993 --> 18:39.824
Monster.

18:41.579 --> 18:46.289
- Creepy. They collected bugs?
- I think these were Arzt's.

18:46.376 --> 18:49.709
He collected all kinds
of creepy crawlies before he...

18:50.380 --> 18:52.996
- ...exploded.
- They must have been friends.

18:53.717 --> 18:55.253
"Expose. "

18:55.885 --> 18:58.217
- Did you just say Expose?
- Yeah.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.715
What the hell is Expose?

18:59.806 --> 19:02.422
Only the most awesome hour
of television ever.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.633
It's like Baywatch, only better.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.434
It's about Autumn and Crystal,

19:06.521 --> 19:08.261
two strippers that solve crimes

19:08.356 --> 19:11.894
with the help of their suave,
smooth-talking club owner, Mr. LaShade.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.146
- How'd I miss that?
- Check it out.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.478
Look at the cast list.
Nikki Fernandez.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.655
That's gotta be
why she was in Australia.

19:18.742 --> 19:22.326
- This must've been her big break.
- [Charlie] Certainly sounds like it.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.572
No way.

19:24.748 --> 19:26.488
Mr. LaShade was The Cobra?

19:26.583 --> 19:28.699
[Charlie] That supposed to
mean something?

19:28.793 --> 19:31.000
[Hurley] Dude,
the Cobra's this big bad guy.

19:31.087 --> 19:34.204
His identity's been shrouded in mystery
for four seasons.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.379
[static]

19:36.926 --> 19:38.507
They had a walkie-talkie?

19:38.595 --> 19:41.553
Every one of those bastards
on the other side of the island

19:41.639 --> 19:43.766
had one like this
hanging from their belts.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.806
So how did Nikki and Paulo get one?

19:46.644 --> 19:48.020
I'll tell you how.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.067
They were working with The Others.

19:57.697 --> 20:01.235
- What gives you the right?
- We thought it was best for everybody.

20:01.326 --> 20:04.033
Are you my mother?
She knows what's best for me.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.452
- Other than that, I decide.
- What's going on?

20:07.665 --> 20:10.873
Kate and her two boyfriends
found a case of guns from the plane.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.700
They decided not to tell the camp.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.286
[Kate] The case is locked.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.214
The key is around Jack's neck.
I promise they're safe.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.801
You're all out of control.

20:20.136 --> 20:23.879
The pigs are walking. Huh?
The pigs are walking!

20:29.104 --> 20:32.767
So, where did you say
you found that case?

20:36.903 --> 20:38.814
It's just water, Paulo.

20:38.905 --> 20:42.318
- Stop being such a wuss and dive in.
- Why me?

20:42.409 --> 20:45.242
Well, as you had no trouble
reminding me,

20:45.328 --> 20:46.989
I slept with Howie Zuckerman.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.993
The least you could do is go for a swim.
They found the case on the bottom.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.075
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

20:53.169 --> 20:56.582
If you didn't need me to find that bag
would we still be together?

20:56.673 --> 20:58.880
That bag is worth eight million dollars.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.633
Just dive in, Paulo.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.699
Well?

21:36.045 --> 21:38.878
- Nothing.
- There's nothing down there?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.708
Just dead bodies.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.144
[Hurley] OK,
so they had a walkie-talkie.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.813
You think they were working
with The Others? How?

21:57.901 --> 21:59.311
Like Michael.

21:59.402 --> 22:02.485
If that's the case, then why
did they kill Nikki and Paulo?

22:02.572 --> 22:04.654
Who knows why
those people do anything?

22:04.741 --> 22:08.074
What matters is, they could be
out there now, waiting to get us.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.617
I don't know, dude.

22:09.704 --> 22:13.492
l was with The Others two weeks ago.
They're on the other side of the island.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.949
Then who dragged me into the jungle?

22:18.254 --> 22:19.915
The Others came into our camp.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.588
They grabbed me, put a bag over my head.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.667
And if I hadn't gotten away,
they would have killed me.

22:27.430 --> 22:31.139
Look, y'all stay here. Let me see
if I can see any sign of them.

22:31.226 --> 22:34.013
- I'll do a perimeter sweep.
- Where'd you get the gun?

22:34.103 --> 22:37.061
- Got it off one of them.
- When were you gonna let us know?

22:37.982 --> 22:39.893
I guess right now.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.820
What, exactly, is a perimeter sweep?

22:48.451 --> 22:50.157
Shouldn't we cover them up?

22:50.245 --> 22:51.576
Yes, of course.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.856
[Locke] Nice night.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.688
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.940
It looks like you're digging a hole.

23:34.664 --> 23:38.828
Every man's entitled to his secrets,
but can I give you a piece of advice?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.078
Please, John.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.581
Put the shovel away
and save yourself trouble.

23:42.672 --> 23:44.037
Why is that?

23:45.216 --> 23:47.457
Things don't stay buried on this island.

23:50.179 --> 23:53.922
The beach is eroding.
Winter's coming. High tide.

23:54.017 --> 23:57.805
Whatever it is you're hiding,
pick a spot that won't wash away.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.689
See you back at camp.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.664
[white noise]

24:52.158 --> 24:53.443
[Ben] Who left this open?

24:53.534 --> 24:55.820
[Juliet] Tom was down here
a couple of days ago.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.652
[Ben] Have him cover it with a plank.

25:06.255 --> 25:09.793
- Is that him? Shephard?
- Yes.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.543
He's cute.

25:15.932 --> 25:17.513
Why are we doing this?

25:17.600 --> 25:20.262
Shephard will never agree
to do the surgery.

25:20.353 --> 25:23.186
- No, I can convince him to do it.
- How?

25:23.272 --> 25:26.014
The same way
I get anybody to do anything.

25:27.443 --> 25:30.185
| find out what he's
emotionally invested in,

25:30.279 --> 25:32.895
and l exploit it.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.652
So, what?

25:35.743 --> 25:38.701
We just grab all three of them?
Ford and Austen too?

25:38.788 --> 25:41.871
- No. They need to come to us.
- How do we make that happen?

25:41.958 --> 25:43.448
Michael, of course.

25:46.295 --> 25:49.662
Are we done here?
This place gives me the creeps.

25:51.551 --> 25:52.961
[clicking]

26:15.658 --> 26:16.898
[static]

26:20.830 --> 26:22.912
Hey, Desmond.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.323
You hear about Nikki and Paulo?

26:25.418 --> 26:29.161
- Aye. Tragic.
- So, do you know anything?

26:31.132 --> 26:33.373
- How do you mean?
- Can you...

26:34.510 --> 26:38.594
- ...you know, use your psychic powers?
- It doesn't work like that.

26:38.681 --> 26:42.515
- | only see flashes.
- No offense, dude, but...

26:42.602 --> 26:46.971
...as far as superpowers go,
yours is kind of lame.

26:48.399 --> 26:49.855
Thanks, anyway.

26:50.985 --> 26:53.476
I do know she was
with your mate this morning.

26:54.447 --> 26:55.687
My mate?

26:56.365 --> 26:58.447
I saw her with your boy Sawyer.

27:01.704 --> 27:02.989
The dead girl, Nikki.

27:03.831 --> 27:05.571
He said he didn't know her.

27:05.666 --> 27:09.079
- Then why was she yelling at him?
- Yelling?

27:09.879 --> 27:12.495
- Aye.
- At Sawyer? This morning?

27:16.260 --> 27:17.796
Right before she died.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.390
[panting]

27:25.478 --> 27:28.311
[growling]

27:31.192 --> 27:32.728
Vincent, dude!

27:34.237 --> 27:37.195
He saw Sawyer and Nikki fighting.
That doesn't prove anything.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.397
Look at the facts and ask yourself,

27:39.492 --> 27:42.108
why is Sawyer gung-ho
about investigating this?

27:42.203 --> 27:45.661
What's in it for him?
He pretended he didn't know their names.

27:45.748 --> 27:49.161
- Then he was fighting with Nikki.
- Sawyer's not a murderer.

27:49.252 --> 27:52.210
He went all the way across the island
to help Michael.

27:52.296 --> 27:55.163
It is The Others.
I know what they can do.

27:55.258 --> 27:57.499
OK, you know what?
I'll go get Desmond.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.754
He'll tell you exactly what he saw.

28:03.808 --> 28:05.014
Sun?

28:09.438 --> 28:12.896
- It was me.
- What?

28:15.403 --> 28:18.861
It was me who took you.
Not The Others.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.118
I wasn't myself,

28:26.956 --> 28:30.448
after Locke hit me.
After he humiliated me.

28:32.587 --> 28:35.579
Sawyer told me I could get even
by helping steal the guns.

28:35.673 --> 28:39.882
We just made it look like The Others.

28:43.306 --> 28:45.467
I didn't mean to hurt you.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.139
I'm sorry.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.606
Everybody, we're heading
to the Pearl Station.

28:59.697 --> 29:03.064
There's a computer that might help us.
Anybody want to come?

29:03.159 --> 29:04.899
- I'll go.
- Great.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.859
- What?
- Anybody else want to come?

29:06.954 --> 29:09.787
Meet us at the tree line in ten minutes
and bring water.

29:09.874 --> 29:12.832
- You're not serious?
- What?

29:12.919 --> 29:15.456
You always whine
about not being included.

29:15.546 --> 29:17.252
Now's our chance.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.003
Hey, guys?

29:25.890 --> 29:27.505
What are these other TVs for?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.674
Sorry?

29:29.769 --> 29:31.509
[Nikki] All these TVs.

29:32.188 --> 29:34.895
This guy says that
there are six stations.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.938
Wait, here, check it out.

29:37.026 --> 29:39.438
[man] Hi, I’m Dr. Mark Wickmund.

29:42.031 --> 29:46.991
There’s a monitoring station where
the activities of participants in Dharma

29:47.078 --> 29:50.866
in our initiative projects
can be observed and recorded.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.450
[Nikki] "Projects."
More than one.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.411
Maybe some of these TVs
are connected to other hatches.

29:58.506 --> 30:00.667
[Locke] I'm certainly feeling
very stupid.

30:00.758 --> 30:03.420
[Sayid] Perhaps I could patch in
one of the other feeds,

30:03.511 --> 30:05.217
see if we can get another picture.

30:08.349 --> 30:10.431
[water flushing]

30:12.937 --> 30:14.347
[sighs]

30:16.399 --> 30:18.355
The toilet still works.

30:35.584 --> 30:38.667
- Gimme the gun.
- What the hell are you talking about?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.832
Give it to me.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.040
It ain't even loaded.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.298
Then how are you
"sweeping the perimeter?"

30:48.389 --> 30:51.847
Quit lying, dude. Desmond saw you
fighting with Nikki this morning.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.346
Oh, I see what this is.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.440
Villagers got themselves some torches.

31:02.236 --> 31:04.522
- Did you kill them?
- No.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.030
No, I didn't kill them.

31:10.453 --> 31:13.320
Yeah, me and Nikki went at it
this morning,

31:14.415 --> 31:17.657
- because she wanted a gun.
- Why didn't you tell us this before?

31:22.423 --> 31:24.459
Because of the dirt under her nails.

31:25.134 --> 31:26.624
- What?
- She was digging.

31:27.678 --> 31:30.385
And when we found him,
I saw a fresh mound of dirt.

31:30.473 --> 31:32.304
She was burying something.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.599
And if you take the time
to dig a hole right before you die,

31:36.270 --> 31:39.182
then what you're hiding's
probably pretty damn good.

31:39.273 --> 31:42.140
So what was it?
What did she hide?

31:55.247 --> 31:56.908
Go ahead, take 'em.

31:58.167 --> 32:01.625
Because whatever happened to those two,
I had nothing to do with it.

32:27.196 --> 32:30.108
Did you know Thanksgiving
was two weeks ago?

32:32.576 --> 32:36.114
We missed it, Paulo.
Just like we're gonna miss everything.

32:36.205 --> 32:38.571
They're going to find us.

32:38.666 --> 32:40.907
We'll get rescued. You'll see.

32:42.002 --> 32:46.245
OK, where did this sudden
burst of optimism come from?

32:47.633 --> 32:51.000
I don't know.
I guess it's how you look at things.

32:53.389 --> 32:54.754
Like the bag.

32:54.849 --> 32:58.967
I mean, maybe not finding it
was good for us.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.136
- How do you figure that?
- Look what it did.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.982
lt might've torn us apart.

33:09.780 --> 33:11.065
Yeah.

33:17.121 --> 33:18.611
Wait here.

33:18.706 --> 33:22.073
- I'm gonna get us some breakfast.
- OK.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.440
OK, I know you have them.

33:53.032 --> 33:56.365
- Give me a gun!
- I don't have the guns.

33:56.452 --> 33:58.192
- The A-Team took 'em all.
- Right.

33:58.287 --> 34:00.744
Except for the ones
you kept for yourself.

34:00.831 --> 34:03.618
Even if I had a gun,
I wouldn't give it to you.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.825
Judging by the fire you're breathin',

34:05.920 --> 34:08.002
I got a feelin'
no good would come of it.

34:08.088 --> 34:12.502
- Sawyer, give me a gun.
- I got a better idea, sister.

34:12.593 --> 34:16.131
How about you go stick your head
in the ocean and cool yourself off.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.713
Thanks for nothing.

34:22.144 --> 34:23.975
And who the hell are you?

34:32.988 --> 34:34.649
Thanks for nothing.

34:50.923 --> 34:53.585
Charlie told me it was your idea...

34:55.010 --> 34:56.511
...to kidnap me.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.381
[sighs]

35:05.062 --> 35:07.348
- You gonna tell Jin?
- No.

35:15.990 --> 35:17.105
Why not?

35:17.199 --> 35:20.157
Because then
we'd have to dig another grave.

35:28.794 --> 35:32.787
- Why are you giving me these?
- Because they're worthless here.

35:34.258 --> 35:38.046
And I thought I was gonna get out
of this without a lecture... [grunts]

35:47.563 --> 35:49.303
Nikki and Paulo...

35:50.024 --> 35:52.390
I guess we didn't
really know you very well.

35:54.695 --> 35:58.062
And it appears
you killed each other for diamonds.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.990
But I know
there were good parts to you, too.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.817
You were always nice to me.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.655
And you were a member of the camp.

36:09.710 --> 36:14.204
And... I really loved Expose.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.708
OK, then.

36:19.803 --> 36:21.543
- Good-bye.
- Wait.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.105
Rest in peace, Nikki and Paulo.

36:44.203 --> 36:47.286
- Come on, Nikki. Just tell me.
- Nuh-uh. It's a surprise.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.457
We're almost there.

36:51.126 --> 36:52.832
OK, ready?

36:54.213 --> 36:57.421
- Yeah.
- I found the diamonds, Paulo.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.629
What? Where?

37:02.721 --> 37:04.427
Right here.

37:07.184 --> 37:09.175
Give them to me.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.854
What's this? Your nicotine gum?

37:18.487 --> 37:22.275
You wanted to stop looking for the bag
because you'd already found it!

37:22.908 --> 37:25.069
I know you have them.
Where are they?

37:25.160 --> 37:27.116
Calm down, OK?

37:28.622 --> 37:30.237
What the hell is that?

37:30.332 --> 37:32.243
[groans]

37:33.252 --> 37:36.710
- Are you out of your mind?
- You remember Dr. Arzt's friend?

37:36.797 --> 37:39.083
Did it bite you?

37:40.175 --> 37:42.006
Does it hurt?

37:42.094 --> 37:44.551
He told me why they call it
the Medusa spider.

37:44.638 --> 37:46.344
Wanna know why?

37:48.851 --> 37:50.716
What did you do? [panting]

37:54.523 --> 37:57.606
Because one look from Medusa
would turn anyone to stone.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.901
Just like one bite from this spider
will paralyze you.

38:00.988 --> 38:03.070
For, uh, about eight hours.

38:04.199 --> 38:07.566
It won't kill you.
lt'll just slow your heart rate down

38:07.661 --> 38:12.030
to the point where even a doctor
would have a hard time hearing it beat.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.950
You won't be able to move a muscle,

38:16.044 --> 38:20.037
so I'll be able to do all sorts
of nasty things to you.

38:21.216 --> 38:26.176
And since it bit you on your neck,
I'd say paralysis will happen fast.

38:32.144 --> 38:35.056
I'm guessing that
you have the diamonds on you.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.138
- Huh?
- [groans]

38:43.530 --> 38:45.066
In a shoe, maybe?

38:53.665 --> 38:55.576
I think I know where.

39:05.511 --> 39:07.297
Son of a bitch.

39:10.224 --> 39:13.341
- I'm sorry.
- You're only sorry you got caught.

39:17.105 --> 39:21.439
l was afraid of losing you.

39:23.403 --> 39:25.655
[panting]

39:25.739 --> 39:29.948
If you found the diamonds,
you wouldn't need me anymore.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.525
[gasping] Ow!

40:09.616 --> 40:10.731
Damn it!

40:12.995 --> 40:14.826
No! No! No!

40:18.083 --> 40:19.948
[panting]

40:35.851 --> 40:37.842
Uh... You OK?

40:40.522 --> 40:41.853
[thudding]

40:45.652 --> 40:49.190
- Hey! Hey, what happened?
- Paralyzed.
