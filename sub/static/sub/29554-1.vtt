01:38.765 --> 01:42.758
This morning, the search for the fugitives
known as the Devil's Rejects

01:42.869 --> 01:45.360
resulted in a violent clash
with the police.

01:45.439 --> 01:49.375
The three suspects connected to
the House of 1,000 Corpses murders,

01:49.443 --> 01:51.468
were stopped dead in their tracks today.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.308
All three suspects
remain in intensive care

01:54.414 --> 01:56.075
at Mercy of Christ Memorial.

01:56.149 --> 02:00.711
Doctors say chances for survival
are less than a million-to-one.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.948
May 23rd, 1978.

02:06.059 --> 02:09.586
This is the day three of the most
infamous outlaws

02:09.663 --> 02:11.756
in the history of American crime,

02:11.832 --> 02:14.926
seemingly met their final fate.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.596
Twenty bullet wounds a piece.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.765
No one would have thought it possible
that a single body

02:20.841 --> 02:25.403
could survive such
a devastating onslaught of destruction,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.106
but they did.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.809
Over the next year,
the critically injured outlaws of mayhem

02:30.917 --> 02:34.011
found their way back
to the land of the living.

02:34.821 --> 02:38.587
The ensuing trial
would be the longest murder trial

02:38.659 --> 02:40.024
in American history.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.595
Perhaps because of
the massive press coverage

02:42.663 --> 02:47.430
the Rejects received,
they became martyrs to the youth.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.266
They're cool, man.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.498
I think it's all a big conspiracy.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.540
They know that
Captain Spaulding is the man

02:54.641 --> 02:57.667
and they know that he knows
what this country needs, you dig?

02:57.778 --> 03:01.942
Spaulding says, "Fuck you and your system."

03:02.516 --> 03:03.778
I'm in control."

03:03.850 --> 03:05.328
I don't believe she did it.

03:05.352 --> 03:09.186
It is obvious to me that she is
not capable of those things.

03:09.289 --> 03:10.347
No way.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.481
Peace and love.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.287
Baby. Oh, man!

03:13.360 --> 03:15.487
Heard she's got it going on, you know?

03:15.562 --> 03:17.894
I mean, I like the way that she moves.

03:17.998 --> 03:22.128
It's like she's floating on a cloud
or something. She's amazing.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.968
Am I gonna be on the TV? Hi!

03:26.039 --> 03:27.550
I mean, I think Otis is sexy.

03:27.574 --> 03:30.668
I mean, he's a bad man
and he's done some bad things,

03:30.744 --> 03:32.405
but, like, I'd date him.

03:32.512 --> 03:36.972
You wanted the goddamn Boogeyman
in your silly little lives.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.415
Well, you've got him.

03:38.518 --> 03:41.646
There's no tucking justice in this world.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.980
I am justice!

03:43.056 --> 03:46.025
They're trying to blame us,
but we didn't do it.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.526
Free the three!

03:47.594 --> 03:48.594
Free the three!

03:48.695 --> 03:52.096
Free the three!
Free the three! Free the three!

04:09.216 --> 04:11.707
Bain County Correctional.

04:11.785 --> 04:16.279
For the last 10 years,
Warden Virgil Dallas Harper

04:16.389 --> 04:20.382
had been responsible
for housing the two most famous killers

04:20.459 --> 04:21.757
since Burke and Hare.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.523
For the past decade,

04:23.597 --> 04:26.088
you have kept Spaulding and Otis
isolated from each other.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.929
Now, do you see the duo as a threat?

04:29.035 --> 04:31.435
I don't find them a threat.
No threat at all.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.031
Especially Spaulding.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.372
He's a geriatric corpse
with one boot in the grave

04:37.444 --> 04:39.537
and the other dancing around the edge.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.776
I don't see him as a menace
to anyone except himself,

04:44.584 --> 04:46.484
Today, guys, Anytime.

04:48.588 --> 04:51.250
Which one of your geniuses
is doing the interviewing?

04:51.324 --> 04:52.621
Yeah, I am.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.956
Thank you for taking the time to do this.

04:55.061 --> 04:58.292
- You ready?
- I ain't getting any younger.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.888
You dressed as a clown,

04:59.966 --> 05:04.801
but behind that colorful facade of joy
lurks something much darker.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.567
Who is the real Captain Spaulding?

05:09.009 --> 05:12.001
Goddamn, boy, Could you get more dramatic?

05:12.112 --> 05:16.845
Well, what I ain't is the fantasy created
by the injustice system

05:16.950 --> 05:18.508
and all them apes.

05:18.618 --> 05:19.915
That's all on them.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.746
- So you're saying...
- I'm saying

05:22.823 --> 05:26.623
I'm just a clown
dancing for the fucking man.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.594
A dancing clown that's been
convicted of 38 murders.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.824
I ought to slap the shit out of you.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.600
Let me put it to you this way.

05:34.668 --> 05:39.105
What's the difference
between a dead squirrel laying in the road

05:39.172 --> 05:42.005
and a dead clown laying in the road?

05:42.976 --> 05:45.035
Yeah, I don't understand the question.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.112
Do I stutter?

05:48.815 --> 05:49.815
I don't know.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.818
There are skid marks
in front of the squirrel.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.982
You roll that around in your coconut
for a while, big shot.

05:57.624 --> 06:01.116
So, you think you were railroaded by
the system because you're a clown?

06:01.194 --> 06:03.788
I am what they make me.

06:03.864 --> 06:09.063
I'm your bozo Jesus hung out to dry
for the sins of mankind!

06:09.502 --> 06:10.901
Oh, fuck.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.802
All hail the man behind the grease paint.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.409
Early this morning, Captain Spaulding,

06:27.520 --> 06:30.421
the killer clown,
was executed by lethal injection.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.150
It was carried out quietly.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.865
He did not resist. There was no violence.

06:33.927 --> 06:37.886
His last words were just, "Give my
love to my family and to my friends."

06:37.998 --> 06:40.660
Those who saw him die have no remorse.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.861
You see all these maniacs,

06:42.936 --> 06:44.267
that they're running around

06:44.371 --> 06:46.566
thinking that this nutjob, this killer,

06:46.673 --> 06:48.265
is some kind of great person?

06:48.375 --> 06:51.105
Well, he's not.
You know what he is? He's the Devil!

06:51.244 --> 06:54.611
Spaulding was pronounced dead at 5:54 am.

06:54.714 --> 06:58.616
You know what they say,
all the world loves a clown.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.359
Is Otis the most
dangerous man alive?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.223
He's nothing.

07:08.295 --> 07:11.958
He's like the rest of the liters
rotting in the cages here.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.532
Bunch of nothings.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.864
Yeah.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.030
I think I know what you're looking for.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.369
We're just looking
for the truth.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.376
You wouldn't know the truth
if I crammed it down your fucking throat.

07:27.614 --> 07:28.808
Boy, you're marked.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.747
Christ, you're already dead.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.080
You just don't know it.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.144
The truth is the truth.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.450
The truth is a fucking knife.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.755
Cuts deep and it cuts both ways.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.120
Which end of the buck knife
are you holding?

07:45.231 --> 07:46.630
The handle or the blade?

07:49.669 --> 07:50.966
You don't even know.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.806
So, what do you want?
Shall I break down in tears

07:55.909 --> 07:59.777
and confess my sins
to the holy fucking pussy of the virgin?

08:06.086 --> 08:07.485
I'm not a bad man.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.348
I'm just another lost soul,

08:11.458 --> 08:15.588
searching for forgiveness
in this wicked, wicked world.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.470
Hello, America.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.635
Did you miss me?

08:34.614 --> 08:36.878
I am Satan's destroyer.

08:36.982 --> 08:39.451
I am the eternal flame of salvation,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.145
burning through your life,

08:41.221 --> 08:44.349
your liberty and your pursuit
of fucking happiness.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.188
I suggest you get ready to burn,
motherfucker,

08:55.402 --> 08:57.302
The footage you are about to see

08:57.370 --> 09:02.137
was shot on the morning
of October 2nd, 1988.

09:02.208 --> 09:07.578
The filmmakers who've documented this
did not survive the experience.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.554
I remember you.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.228
I don't remember you.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.196
You will, motherfucker.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.263
Work detail, toes on the line.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.833
Move up. Let's go!

09:44.184 --> 09:45.378
Start digging.

09:55.228 --> 09:59.289
The following piece of film
is the only clue that police have

09:59.399 --> 10:02.630
concerning the escape of Otis Driftwood.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.768
Viewer discretion is advised.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.317
Who are you?

10:20.420 --> 10:22.251
Payback's a bitch, motherfucker.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.327
Public enemy number one, motherfucker.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.130
Number one!

10:38.905 --> 10:42.170
This man is
Winslow Foxworth Coltrane,

10:42.275 --> 10:44.766
aka. The Midnight Wolfman,

10:44.844 --> 10:49.747
and the half-brother
of Otis Driftwood and Baby Firefly.

10:49.816 --> 10:55.015
The Driftwood escape left a horrifying
crime scene of death in its wake.

10:55.121 --> 11:00.753
As of the airing of this program,
Otis Driftwood is still at large.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.295
Incredible savings
up to half off and more

11:03.363 --> 11:05.263
on living rooms,
bedrooms and dining rooms.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.822
Layaway free for up to a year.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.164
I look like a fucking stooge!

11:11.037 --> 11:13.005
Bam! He escapes on camera

11:13.106 --> 11:14.801
with a massacre to rub in my face.

11:14.874 --> 11:17.468
Christ, Virgil, it wasn't your fault.
I know that.

11:17.544 --> 11:20.342
Of course, it ain't.
I know that and you know that,

11:20.446 --> 11:22.380
but the illiterate public doesn't.

11:22.482 --> 11:26.316
You think Ma and Pa Kettle reading about
those dead fucking prison guards

11:26.386 --> 11:28.445
is gonna pin the blame on them?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.455
No, They're fucking heroes!

11:37.130 --> 11:40.497
Is it just me, or are these
the greatest fucking beans on Earth?

11:41.167 --> 11:42.828
It's just you.

11:42.902 --> 11:46.235
Takes a while to get that prison slop
out of your taste buds.

11:46.739 --> 11:47.899
You got that right.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.067
So, how do you figure
we go about doing this?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.676
Well,

11:57.750 --> 12:01.186
I've been stewing about it 24/7
for about an eight ball.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.353
I got some thoughts.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.686
Whitey, man.

12:05.758 --> 12:08.659
We've been creeping around
this fucking place for a month.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.822
- It's suicide.
- Patience, brother, patience.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.477
You know, I've been running that movie,
The Desperate Hours,

12:15.501 --> 12:17.366
through my head over and over again.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.530
- Remember that shit?
- Not really.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.506
It's a fucking Bogart movie.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.042
I always liked Cagney better.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.374
He's a tough fucking little shit.

12:27.714 --> 12:30.092
"Come on and take it,
you dirty, yellow-bellied rat",

12:30.116 --> 12:31.916
or I'm gonna give it to you
through the door!"

12:34.287 --> 12:35.567
So, lay it on me.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.921
I can only assume in this scenario
I'm Bogart.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.755
"Listen, sweetheart, here's the plan."

12:43.396 --> 12:46.194
You know,
enough of these lousy impressions.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.756
Lousy impressions?

12:47.900 --> 12:51.700
How can you be fucking Bogart
when you don't even know the fucking plan?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.865
I'm a lot more fucking Bogart
than you are,

12:56.476 --> 12:58.103
Well, fuck you.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.809
You are as delusional as fucking ever.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.279
Fine! Fuck. Whatever, man.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.086
Fuck, you can be Bogart.
Just what are we going to do?

13:14.894 --> 13:16.759
I say we make a house call.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.931
Tomorrow marks the first time

13:22.001 --> 13:25.493
that one of the members
of the notorious Devil's Rejects cult

13:25.605 --> 13:27.903
has been eligible for parole.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.772
Vera Ellen Firefly, a.k.a. Baby,

13:30.843 --> 13:34.904
has spent the last 10 years incarcerated
right here behind me at Tucker Farms.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.417
This is a maximum security
correctional institution.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.754
23-20, you have a visit.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.823
23-20.

15:00.199 --> 15:02.690
So, we're just going to,
you know, justjump right to something

15:02.769 --> 15:04.396
that gave us grave concern.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.268
Since your time of incarceration,
you've had

15:08.040 --> 15:12.170
157 violations.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.110
158. 158.

15:14.614 --> 15:18.041
Okay. Yeah, 158,
the most recent being,

15:18.117 --> 15:22.349
you know, you were found in possession of
an inmate manufactured weapon.

15:22.688 --> 15:23.688
One second.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.214
Do you understand that these statistics

15:27.293 --> 15:30.057
do not reflect positively
on these proceedings?

15:30.129 --> 15:34.031
Look, suit, I got to do what I got to do.

15:34.100 --> 15:38.036
It's my rules or the Grim Reaper
comes a rolling through

15:38.104 --> 15:40.129
in a big black Cadillac.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.139
Hey, bitch. Hop in!

15:42.241 --> 15:44.141
You dig?

15:45.411 --> 15:48.380
Yes, I, um... I believe I do.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.811
Uh, take a look at these.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.377
Ah, a little closer, please.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.947
Oh! Yeah.

16:01.494 --> 16:05.260
Do you have anything to say
regarding these photographs?

16:05.331 --> 16:10.098
Yeah. You can't bring the past back up

16:10.169 --> 16:13.263
and prostitute that mock-up

16:13.339 --> 16:17.776
as a picture of something that
happened a hundred years ago!

16:17.844 --> 16:22.577
You think this happened
a hundred years ago?

16:22.915 --> 16:25.315
We can only live in the now.

16:26.919 --> 16:29.820
Now is the now.

16:31.924 --> 16:37.419
Do, um, you believe you're,
uh, suitable for parole?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.525
I mean, look at me.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.166
Really fucking look at me.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.703
I'm fine.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.172
I'm fine.

16:49.275 --> 16:53.371
Do you think that you are, um,
ready to walk out that door,

16:54.180 --> 16:56.444
walk onto the street

16:56.516 --> 16:58.313
and live a productive life?

17:07.226 --> 17:08.659
Yes.

17:08.728 --> 17:13.563
If down the line, the opportunity,
for parole presented itself,

17:13.665 --> 17:16.134
and you were given a parole date,

17:16.202 --> 17:18.136
what would your plans be?

17:22.141 --> 17:24.132
Whoopie!

17:24.210 --> 17:29.204
I'd be Snow White in the forest,
playing with all the animals,

17:29.315 --> 17:31.010
I'd play with the bunnies,

17:31.717 --> 17:33.548
whistle while I work.

17:36.355 --> 17:40.917
I I'M A STAR, MOTHERFUCKER:

17:41.561 --> 17:44.029
J' Stars always shine J'

17:44.897 --> 17:46.364
I' Sparkle J'

17:47.533 --> 17:50.866
Prisoner is denied parole for five years,

17:51.837 --> 17:54.271
at which time the case will be reviewed.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.768
That's cool.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.382
Bye.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.627
Fucking bitch!

18:25.104 --> 18:26.298
Good morning.

18:28.307 --> 18:31.105
Every day our search widens.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.940
We 're desperately looking
for these individuals

18:34.046 --> 18:38.710
who, Ibelieve,
to still be in the general area.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.945
What is your biggest worry?

18:41.053 --> 18:44.147
My biggest worry is that they
might kill somebody.

18:44.824 --> 18:49.090
I know we've got some locals
who want to play hero here.

18:49.161 --> 18:52.790
But do not try to apprehend
these suspects.

18:52.898 --> 18:55.628
They are armed and extremely dangerous.

18:56.836 --> 18:57.894
Wake up, asshole.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.605
Get those clams up where I can see them.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.944
Get up. Come on!

19:07.413 --> 19:08.573
Easy, baby, huh?

19:09.815 --> 19:10.941
Easy, man.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.585
Oh, man.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.985
It's all fucking cool.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.579
Tony, that's him, all right.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.086
That's the brother.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.288
That's the one they call
The Midnight Wolfman.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.364
You folks are mistaking me
for someone else.

19:28.334 --> 19:33.772
Oh, I know a convict
spewing convict bullshit when I see one.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.437
I bet you're worth something dead.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.978
Oh, no. He's worth more alive.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.308
You need to just sit

19:42.014 --> 19:43.606
and think for a second.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.651
There ain't nothing to think about.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.949
I was thinking you could think about
a nice big pair ofjuicy titties.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.388
- What?
- Like your sister wife's titties.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.186
They're a good fucking pair.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.722
What are you getting at?

19:56.829 --> 20:00.162
So, imagine her titties sitting there
and a group of men sitting around,

20:00.232 --> 20:02.644
jacking off over them,
jizz going everywhere. Maybe one of them

20:02.668 --> 20:04.346
- sits down and shits on her.
- Tony, do something.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.339
Now I ain't into shitting on people,
but maybe he's into shitting on her

20:07.406 --> 20:09.618
and he shits all over her.
Another couple of guys are pissing on her,

20:09.642 --> 20:11.219
'cause that's the kind of thing
people are into.

20:11.243 --> 20:12.540
No. Shoot him. Shoot him now!

20:12.645 --> 20:16.046
It's what people normally do
when they got a pair of titties like that.

20:24.223 --> 20:28.057
Okay, lady,
put the gun down nice and slow.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.491
Shit, man.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.156
I mention a pair of titties
and every fucking asshole

20:32.231 --> 20:33.425
forgets what he's doing, huh?

20:36.435 --> 20:38.335
Are you fucking crying?

20:38.404 --> 20:42.170
I ain't crying. I got a piece of
fucking skull in my eye. That shit hurts.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.074
Man, you sure can bitch
a song about nothing.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.904
See? Fucking skull.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.415
Please. I beg you. Please.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.247
Just let me go.

20:54.353 --> 20:57.345
Let me go and I won't...
I didn't see anything,

20:57.423 --> 20:59.584
I didn't see... Help me!

20:59.692 --> 21:01.592
That's a nice knife.

21:02.795 --> 21:03.955
Ah.

21:05.397 --> 21:06.864
Is it sharp?

21:06.932 --> 21:09.230
- W hy?
- Trust me.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.632
You really don't wanna know.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.891
23-20, you have a visit.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.227
23-20, you have a visit.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.577
Oh!

21:56.315 --> 21:58.408
Sorry about the broken nose.

21:59.418 --> 22:01.147
Oh, you will be, bitch.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.948
Trust me, you will be.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.487
So, now what, huh?

22:13.098 --> 22:15.623
You gonna try and get it on
with me or something?

22:17.703 --> 22:19.330
Oh, you'll find out.

22:22.608 --> 22:26.476
Come on. I know how you
dyke guards are always dreaming about me.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.113
Yeah, I've been dreaming
about this for a longtime.

22:37.323 --> 22:38.483
Greta.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.288
I thought we were going to be friends.

22:42.328 --> 22:45.024
You just turned out to be
too much of an asshole.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.291
Have fun, bitch.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.846
Come on, cutie!

23:05.918 --> 23:07.977
Oh, yeah, fresh meat.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.022
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.251
Oh, come on, kitty, kitty.

23:13.859 --> 23:15.588
Come on, fresh meat.

23:18.330 --> 23:22.096
Look what we have here.
Little Miss Hot Shit.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.567
Hey, Poker.

23:25.671 --> 23:28.834
How long have we been waiting
to get our hands on this creep?

23:28.908 --> 23:32.173
A long fucking time, sister.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.838
A long fucking time!

23:34.914 --> 23:38.008
Yeah, Little Miss Hot Shit
ain't never gonna walk straight

23:38.083 --> 23:39.914
once we get a hold of her

23:40.019 --> 23:42.715
and squeeze all the cream out of her.

23:42.788 --> 23:45.552
It's cripple time.

23:45.624 --> 23:46.921
It's cripple time!

24:08.280 --> 24:09.440
Come on!

24:25.898 --> 24:27.991
Yeah, that should be enough time.

24:29.935 --> 24:32.927
Ding dong, the bitch is dead.

24:41.347 --> 24:44.316
I take it you took care of the situation.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.820
Yeah, I took care
of the situation all right.

25:15.781 --> 25:21.048
You are something fucking else, bitch!

25:43.142 --> 25:44.182
Please excuse us.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.841
- I need to finish this.
- Finish when I'm finished.

25:47.913 --> 25:50.347
I can't leave an open wound.

25:50.849 --> 25:51.907
I bet you can.

25:55.654 --> 25:56.746
Yes, sir.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.589
Bye.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.025
Look.

26:08.534 --> 26:12.493
Let's cut the usual psycho
bullshit you're about to spew

26:12.571 --> 26:13.833
and get down to it.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.399
That must hurt.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.542
You know...

26:24.116 --> 26:25.208
and I know...

26:27.619 --> 26:30.679
how miserable I can make your life.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.350
So why don't you just tell me
what I want to know...

26:34.526 --> 26:36.619
and we can call it a day.

26:37.563 --> 26:38.689
G Comprende?

26:39.731 --> 26:41.289
I, Que'?

26:41.900 --> 26:43.265
Who let you out of solitary?

26:44.703 --> 26:45.727
Hmm.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.873
Who let me out of solitary?

26:51.043 --> 26:54.274
What makes you think I just
didn't walk out on my own?

26:58.050 --> 26:59.950
Who are you protecting?

27:02.554 --> 27:04.283
One day,

27:04.923 --> 27:07.483
I was out having a stroll...

27:08.560 --> 27:12.052
and I saw a little kitty stuck in a hole.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.927
She was struggling to get out.

27:16.001 --> 27:20.062
So I reached in to get her,
but she scratched me.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.099
Is there a point to the story?

27:23.242 --> 27:24.334
Hmm.

27:26.678 --> 27:30.011
Along comes the big old warden.

27:32.084 --> 27:36.077
He stops and he watches me...

27:37.156 --> 27:39.681
and then he screams,

27:40.592 --> 27:44.926
"Stop trying to help that stupid cat.

27:44.997 --> 27:49.127
She's gonna get herself out of
there one way or another."

27:49.434 --> 27:50.924
Huh?

27:51.670 --> 27:54.468
But I didn't listen
to that dumb old warden.

27:55.541 --> 27:59.841
I kept helping until I got that kitty out.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.337
Are you done?

28:03.215 --> 28:05.342
So what was the point to this story/?

28:25.370 --> 28:29.466
After hearing
from the ambassadors directly involved...

28:47.359 --> 28:49.987
Judy says he barks as soon
as I come down the street.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.223
I don't know whether
he likes me or hates me.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.856
You talked to the owner about it?

28:54.933 --> 28:57.367
I don't even know
what language she speaks.

28:59.771 --> 29:01.238
Judy?

29:06.545 --> 29:08.035
Where is everybody?

29:08.880 --> 29:11.007
What the hell is going on?

29:12.251 --> 29:13.912
Judy?

29:20.092 --> 29:22.754
Help me.

29:22.861 --> 29:25.091
What the hell is this?
Some kind of a sick joke?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.425
This has been a long day. It ain't funny.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.701
I don't know.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.640
Pretty goddamn funny to me.

29:37.743 --> 29:40.303
Guess who's coming down, bitches?

29:40.412 --> 29:43.939
The dynamic-fucking-duo, Batman and Robin.

29:44.049 --> 29:48.110
Chief, we need to jaw,
so I suggest you two sit your asses down.

29:49.554 --> 29:51.647
Hi, sweetie, What's your name?

29:51.757 --> 29:53.952
Look, you don't have to do this.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.322
Please.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.292
Or what?

29:57.429 --> 30:00.557
You gonna throw me in the hole
and make me sleep in my own piss and shit?

30:00.632 --> 30:03.100
No,
you could just walk out that door.

30:03.168 --> 30:06.433
Keep walking and never look back.

30:06.505 --> 30:10.498
Oh, brother, what a sweet little man.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.975
We should let the lovebirds go.

30:15.847 --> 30:17.610
- Hey! Open your mouth.
- Nol.

30:17.683 --> 30:18.980
- Open your mouth!
- No!

30:19.084 --> 30:22.076
Open your mouth. Open your fucking mouth.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.248
- Look, look...
- Practice sucking on that for a while.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.926
I'll get around to the real deal later.

30:32.998 --> 30:37.958
And remember, I feel any teeth,
it's gonna be a bad day at Black Rock.

30:38.036 --> 30:39.298
Look! Look! Get...

30:41.440 --> 30:42.964
Don't.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.303
Just stop.

30:44.810 --> 30:46.778
You can't fix this.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.278
0h!

30:48.347 --> 30:50.542
You know,
she's not a bad little cocksucker.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.947
She could be better, but don't worry,

30:53.352 --> 30:54.683
I'll teach her.

30:56.955 --> 30:58.980
Let's go.

30:59.725 --> 31:01.454
She's got nothing to do with us.

31:06.998 --> 31:09.023
Shut the fuck up!

31:10.302 --> 31:11.496
My finger slipped.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.130
Jesus Christ! He fucking shot me.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.731
"Jesus Christ,
he fucking shot me."

31:16.842 --> 31:19.208
- What is happening?
- Let me go over and help him, please.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.311
Sit down.

31:20.645 --> 31:21.907
Sit down.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.086
I heard you kept your mouth shut.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.092
That's good.

31:42.267 --> 31:43.825
I trained you well.

31:45.003 --> 31:47.403
Remember, snitches get stitches.

31:49.107 --> 31:52.076
Oh, but I see
you already got your stitches.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.109
"Snitches get stitches,."

31:58.917 --> 32:00.544
That's cute.

32:03.622 --> 32:07.058
You think I don't know what you do?

32:09.027 --> 32:15.523
Every night you told me up
and put me into your pocket.

32:17.269 --> 32:20.102
You take me home.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.301
I watch you...

32:24.376 --> 32:26.776
sitting all alone,

32:27.612 --> 32:31.309
getting all wetjust thinking of me.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.053
I live inside your head.

32:38.490 --> 32:41.084
I live inside your head.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.155
I do, I live in your head.

32:57.409 --> 33:00.401
You can't trick me, you bitch.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.349
I shot out of my mama hustling.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.748
You can't hustle the hustler.

33:37.983 --> 33:41.146
What exactly do you expect
to gain by doing this?

33:41.219 --> 33:43.779
I don't expect anything.

33:43.855 --> 33:48.019
I demand that you spring
my sister from the clink

33:48.126 --> 33:50.390
and deliver her to me ASAP.

33:50.495 --> 33:54.124
What? That's impossible. I can't walk out
the front door with a prisoner.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.793
What you're asking my husband
is completely insane.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.358
I'm completely insane!

33:58.470 --> 34:00.301
He ain't asking, he's telling.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.863
Big difference, bitch.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.306
Don't call me "bitch."

34:06.545 --> 34:08.409
I can call you whatever I want...

34:09.547 --> 34:11.311
and you're gonna love it,

34:12.083 --> 34:13.482
bitch.

34:14.753 --> 34:15.811
I ain't afraid of you.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.047
0h!

34:19.324 --> 34:20.985
There must be something else I can do.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.719
Just give them whatever they want.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.851
You can't reason with these maniacs.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.192
He's bleeding to death.

34:26.264 --> 34:29.391
Oh, Jesus Christ. It's a flesh wound.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.731
Show him the safe.

34:31.835 --> 34:34.498
For God's sake, you cheap asshole,
give him some money!

34:34.572 --> 34:39.442
Whoa! Stop the fucking press.
Asshole has a safe? What safe?

34:39.543 --> 34:41.842
No, no. Just... That's not it.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.404
Just put that back up on the shelf.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.594
There's nothing in there for you.
It's my mother's ashes.

34:46.618 --> 34:47.915
Just put it back.

34:48.018 --> 34:52.284
No! Do not stick your nasty,
filthy fucking hands...

34:52.389 --> 34:54.880
Oh, my God, you fucking asshole!

34:54.960 --> 34:56.928
Oh, my God!

34:57.027 --> 34:58.791
Oh, my God!

34:58.897 --> 35:01.263
Oh, my God!

35:01.366 --> 35:02.924
Fly away, Mama.

35:03.034 --> 35:04.626
Fly away, Mama.

35:04.736 --> 35:08.729
Fly! Fly! Run away, Mama.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.539
Money/I.

35:11.876 --> 35:13.571
What am I gonna buy?

35:13.645 --> 35:15.306
Look at me.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.711
Look at me!

35:18.116 --> 35:20.380
I got everything I need.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.477
I ain't no fucking slave to the system.

35:26.324 --> 35:27.586
Who the fuck is that?

35:29.227 --> 35:30.319
No one.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.963
We're not expecting anyone, I swear.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.966
Watch these assholes. I'll handle this.

35:51.282 --> 35:52.681
A fucking clown?

35:52.784 --> 35:54.251
Well, hello.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.446
You must be the lady of the household.

35:57.188 --> 35:59.679
Oh, I almost forgot.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.691
This is for you.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.019
A balloon sculpture?

36:04.129 --> 36:06.529
They call me the Picasso of inflatables.

36:06.631 --> 36:08.292
Well, I can see that.

36:08.366 --> 36:10.197
So, where's the party?

36:13.271 --> 36:14.636
Oh, fuck.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.105
After you, Bozo.

36:25.450 --> 36:29.386
Attention, everybody.
The evening's entertainment has arrived.

36:30.321 --> 36:32.653
What the fuck are we gonna do
with that kiddy tickler?

36:32.724 --> 36:35.989
Well, if he makes us laugh,
we'll let him go.

36:36.394 --> 36:39.653
Uh... What if I don't?

36:39.731 --> 36:43.565
Well, grease paint,
that most likely won't be so funny.

36:47.172 --> 36:49.538
It looks like we're gonna have
a laugh party here.

36:49.641 --> 36:54.305
And if you have a laugh party,
you got to have funny music.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.040
There you go.

36:57.682 --> 36:59.309
Let's see what 1 have in here.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.215
Oh, oh, oh!

37:01.820 --> 37:03.720
Oh, well, that's not fun.

37:04.155 --> 37:07.181
Okay. 0h, card tricks. Card tricks.

37:07.258 --> 37:10.989
Who loves good card tricks, huh?
I sure love good card tricks.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.154
Let's see now.

37:13.431 --> 37:16.764
Well, that seems to be malfunctioning.

37:17.368 --> 37:19.233
Uh... Oh!

37:19.337 --> 37:20.736
M a' am?

37:21.506 --> 37:24.168
Here. Dry those tears.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.767
I'm funnier than you think.

37:28.012 --> 37:31.846
You know, I got these pants
from a fella who was on a diet.

37:32.383 --> 37:34.442
It was a seafood diet.

37:34.552 --> 37:36.179
He saw food and he ate it!

37:41.626 --> 37:43.787
My mom told me that joke.

37:44.395 --> 37:45.885
Oh.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.695
Ow! Ooh!

37:48.767 --> 37:50.758
Baggy Pants hurt his head.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.097
Ooh.

37:52.203 --> 37:53.602
Party!

37:53.705 --> 37:56.139
J' We throw a party! I.

38:27.772 --> 38:30.332
Bravo, Bozo, bravo.

38:39.417 --> 38:42.147
The little fucker pissed himself.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.657
Ah, fuck, he made me laugh.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.188
Oh.

38:49.294 --> 38:51.785
- So I'm free to go?
- Yeah.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.660
Straight to clown heaven.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.100
I hate clowns.

39:29.467 --> 39:31.298
Hi.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.483
Hi. I'm here.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.606
Hi.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.181
Wait.

40:24.622 --> 40:26.055
Come back.

40:29.894 --> 40:31.418
No.

40:33.798 --> 40:35.595
Kitty.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.198
No.

40:45.910 --> 40:49.710
This fucking guy really loves himself.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.272
Except he's got a face
you just want to punch.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.617
Okay, Mr. Mustache.

41:01.225 --> 41:02.920
Here's the plan.

41:03.394 --> 41:06.727
Tomorrow, we wake up,

41:06.798 --> 41:12.259
put on some of that nice cologne
that your wife loves so much,

41:12.337 --> 41:15.306
maybe one of these,
uh, faggy flowered shirts...

41:18.242 --> 41:19.937
Those strange glasses,

41:20.011 --> 41:23.640
and drive to work, go into the office,

41:23.748 --> 41:25.306
pick up the phone,

41:25.416 --> 41:30.945
and spin some bullshit story up
to get Baby brought to your office.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.855
And she changes into some
prison-guard duds,

41:33.958 --> 41:36.358
you sneak her out and you bring her here.

41:36.461 --> 41:38.258
It's simple.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.028
Can't happen, it's impossible.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.532
Don't tell me what's impossible,
motherfucker!

41:43.634 --> 41:45.363
I am the impossible!

41:45.470 --> 41:47.597
She's insane.

41:47.672 --> 41:50.664
I take the shackles off,
she's gonna try to kill me.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.202
Well, yeah, that is true.

41:56.781 --> 41:59.113
Okay, I will write you a note,

41:59.717 --> 42:01.514
give it to her first

42:01.619 --> 42:04.611
or else she will make tomorrow
your last day on Earth.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.124
So, we have a deal!

42:42.994 --> 42:46.521
Private island, 23-20.
23-20. You have a visit.

42:46.597 --> 42:48.827
23-20, you have a visit.

43:10.721 --> 43:12.188
You motherfuckers!

43:13.091 --> 43:14.683
It's fucking alpha time.

43:14.759 --> 43:16.624
This is my house!

43:19.263 --> 43:21.390
I need a guard uniform

43:21.466 --> 43:24.697
brought over to my office, ASAP.

43:31.142 --> 43:33.804
- Put me through to 24 Wing.
- 24 Wing.

43:33.911 --> 43:39.975
I need prisoner 133378-1
brought to my office immediately.

43:40.084 --> 43:41.312
I need prior authorization.

43:41.419 --> 43:44.980
Don't tell me the rules.
I make the goddamn rules!

43:47.058 --> 43:48.150
Hold on, now.

43:53.231 --> 43:54.596
Come in.

43:54.932 --> 43:56.991
Good morning, sir.

43:57.101 --> 43:58.898
Here's the uniform you requested.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.801
Yeah, leave it on the couch.

44:00.905 --> 44:02.736
Open four.

44:05.910 --> 44:06.910
That's all, Sergeant.

44:06.978 --> 44:08.912
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.971
What? You forgot my name?

44:11.816 --> 44:13.841
You certainly knew my name last week

44:13.951 --> 44:16.146
when you had your fucking hands
down my pants.

44:19.824 --> 44:21.621
Get out! Get out!

44:21.692 --> 44:23.604
You want me to tell your damn wife?
Is that what you want?

44:23.628 --> 44:26.119
- Please leave.
- Don't fucking call me again.

44:26.197 --> 44:28.028
Get out!

44:40.645 --> 44:42.476
Come on in.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.379
Okay, that's fine.

44:53.624 --> 44:55.558
I'll call you when I'm finished.

44:55.660 --> 44:57.685
I think we should stay.

44:57.795 --> 45:00.229
Trust me on this, she ain't like the rest.

45:00.331 --> 45:02.390
- No, I ain't.
- Shut up, bitch.

45:03.334 --> 45:05.962
That's fine. Give me the keys.

45:06.804 --> 45:08.965
- The keys?
- Yes.

45:10.141 --> 45:12.871
Give me the goddamn keys, Greta.

45:16.914 --> 45:20.645
I don't appreciate your tone, sir.

45:23.254 --> 45:24.414
Bad dog.

45:27.658 --> 45:31.389
I'm gonna stay here. Play it safe.

45:31.495 --> 45:34.555
I'll buzz you when it's time
to transport her back.

45:34.999 --> 45:38.901
You should try
the meditation program they offer here.

45:39.503 --> 45:40.731
I love it.

45:41.172 --> 45:42.867
Om.

45:43.274 --> 45:45.105
Om.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.772
Om.

45:47.878 --> 45:49.539
Om.

45:49.614 --> 45:50.876
Like that.

45:50.948 --> 45:52.779
I have something I need you to read.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.683
Read this. I assume you can read.

46:02.059 --> 46:05.961
You got yourself
good and fucked this time.

46:07.531 --> 46:09.226
Do we have a deal?

46:10.635 --> 46:12.102
Well, do we?

46:12.203 --> 46:14.194
Yeah, yeah. Cool, man.

46:14.472 --> 46:15.939
I got it.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.474
No funny stuff. I'll be good.

46:19.076 --> 46:21.306
Cool, cool. I'll keep it cool.

46:23.814 --> 46:25.406
No funny stuff.

46:29.920 --> 46:33.481
Cool beans.

46:36.060 --> 46:38.051
Cool.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.430
Almost. There it goes.

46:42.566 --> 46:44.761
Christ! Calm down, man.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.237
Put this on.

46:52.109 --> 46:53.337
Hmm.

46:53.444 --> 46:55.071
Does it come in any other colors?

46:55.146 --> 46:57.171
Jesus! This is serious.

46:57.515 --> 46:59.745
Man, you are really high-strung.

47:00.685 --> 47:02.482
Got to do something about that.

47:02.987 --> 47:04.352
Right?

47:07.625 --> 47:11.823
Okay, don't peek. Don't peek.
I want it to be a surprise.

47:12.430 --> 47:15.922
No looking. Don't you dare.

47:18.035 --> 47:19.195
Hey.

47:20.705 --> 47:22.536
Everything okay in there?

47:22.640 --> 47:23.868
We're fine.

47:27.111 --> 47:28.840
Where the fuck is she?

47:35.519 --> 47:37.714
What a difference a day makes, huh?

47:54.972 --> 47:56.837
Don't fuck with a scorpion, bitch.

48:04.181 --> 48:05.375
What?

48:06.317 --> 48:07.750
Nothing.

48:08.419 --> 48:10.478
Hey, man, she had it coming.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.852
She had it coming.

48:14.425 --> 48:16.689
She had it coming.

48:20.064 --> 48:21.088
Aw.

48:23.234 --> 48:24.758
We're musicians.

48:24.869 --> 48:27.189
We were tearing up some hot swing music
in the York Esther.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.729
Gail over there was swinging the fans.

48:29.840 --> 48:33.571
Her sweetie, Kirk Robin,
was inhaling a bottle of hooch at a table.

48:45.022 --> 48:47.388
You're in a court.
Class is full. Sit down.

48:47.458 --> 48:49.187
I'm a victim of circumstance.

48:53.764 --> 48:56.028
Wait a minute.
Hold still. I'll get it.

48:56.100 --> 48:58.796
Oh, my nose.

49:08.646 --> 49:11.137
Hey, you're in a court,
not the woods, Tarzan.

49:11.248 --> 49:12.545
Cut it out. Come on.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.835
What a gentleman.

49:38.409 --> 49:40.502
Thank you.

49:40.611 --> 49:42.977
Looks like Virgil
was a good little tin soldier.

49:43.080 --> 49:44.809
Did exactly what he was told.

49:44.915 --> 49:47.281
- Is she with him?
- Fuck, yeah.

50:06.203 --> 50:08.137
Get the fuck in here!

50:08.205 --> 50:10.469
Get down, motherfucker! Get down!

50:10.541 --> 50:12.532
All right, I can fucking get with this!

50:12.643 --> 50:14.474
Foxy!

50:18.716 --> 50:22.152
Baby's back, motherfuckers!

50:22.219 --> 50:25.154
Enough of this sentimental bullshit!
Here, watch him.

50:25.222 --> 50:27.452
- Let's get to it.
- Whoo-hoo.

50:28.359 --> 50:30.554
Oh, Warden.

50:37.468 --> 50:39.060
Turn around, bitch!

50:39.169 --> 50:41.069
Turn the fuck around.

50:59.557 --> 51:00.888
I got her.

51:11.168 --> 51:13.602
Oh, you want to do knives. Okay.

51:17.207 --> 51:18.401
Judy!

51:21.545 --> 51:24.412
Come on. Yeah, this is fun.

51:25.115 --> 51:26.548
Please!

51:49.206 --> 51:52.573
There you go. There you go, bitch!

51:53.944 --> 51:55.639
Time to go back to Mama.

52:48.265 --> 52:49.527
No!

53:12.990 --> 53:14.685
Hey, Granny.

53:16.493 --> 53:17.619
Hi.

53:31.842 --> 53:35.334
Do you remember the first words
you ever spoke to me, Virg?

53:37.347 --> 53:38.347
No.

53:38.415 --> 53:41.179
No? The big man doesn't remember?

53:53.263 --> 53:55.231
Well, guess what, motherfucker?

53:55.332 --> 53:59.564
This is my death factory
and you are the product.

54:12.182 --> 54:15.276
J' And pop, pop
Little party hats and J'

54:15.385 --> 54:17.580
J' Pop, Pop
Little party hats and J'

54:17.688 --> 54:20.020
I Pop, pop Little... r.

54:20.090 --> 54:21.090
Hey!

54:22.726 --> 54:24.216
Oh, I want this.

54:25.562 --> 54:26.562
Um...

54:27.865 --> 54:30.766
some old broad next door
saw me gut that bitch.

54:30.868 --> 54:33.769
Um, think we should think about
rolling out of here soon.

54:33.871 --> 54:35.429
- Okay, get the shit.
- Let's go.

54:35.539 --> 54:36.716
- Let's fucking go.
- Okay.

54:36.740 --> 54:39.470
- Shitl.
- Let's go. Fucking pigs.

54:39.576 --> 54:41.476
Hold on. I want that.

54:45.716 --> 54:47.206
Fuzz, man. Come on.

54:47.284 --> 54:49.411
God, you think this shit is real?

54:49.486 --> 54:51.477
Who gives a fuck, let's go. Come on!

54:52.156 --> 54:54.647
- Come on.
- What's up with the dead clown?

54:54.758 --> 54:57.090
I'll tell you in the car.
Come on, let's go. We got to go!

54:57.161 --> 55:00.392
Jesus Christ.

55:00.464 --> 55:04.298
J' And went through the pool
And the cupcakes J'

55:18.148 --> 55:20.446
Yeah, this place is perfect.

55:20.517 --> 55:22.508
I think we should keep on moving.

55:22.619 --> 55:25.952
Put as many miles between us
and that posse of pigs as possible.

55:26.023 --> 55:29.754
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
I'm doing all the fucking driving.

55:30.360 --> 55:32.954
I can hardly keep
my fucking eyeballs open.

55:33.030 --> 55:35.999
Well, excuse me
for having night blindness.

55:36.099 --> 55:38.090
Them fucked up retinas is no picnic.

55:41.104 --> 55:42.969
Let me drive.

55:47.177 --> 55:49.270
Let me drive.

55:50.614 --> 55:52.673
- What?
- Shit, man! What am I speaking?

55:52.783 --> 55:54.614
Fucking Chinese? Let me fucking drive.

55:54.685 --> 55:56.175
No fucking way.

55:56.286 --> 55:58.631
- What's the fucking problem?
- Yeah, what's the fucking problem?

55:58.655 --> 56:01.624
The fucking problem is she will get us
pulled over within five minutes

56:01.692 --> 56:04.024
of her sliding her ass behind this wheel.

56:04.127 --> 56:05.560
Fuck you.

56:06.530 --> 56:08.657
I drive just fine.

56:11.034 --> 56:12.467
So, what now?

56:12.536 --> 56:15.334
So, go get us a motel room, motherfucker.

56:15.405 --> 56:18.033
Me? I'm the most
recognizable of the bunch.

56:18.141 --> 56:20.701
I'm the goddamn Midnight Wolfman,
motherfucker.

56:20.811 --> 56:25.680
Seriously? No one knows who you are.
I'm public enemy number one.

56:25.749 --> 56:27.307
This mug is world-famous.

56:27.384 --> 56:29.648
You're insane.

56:29.720 --> 56:32.348
For those two-bit crimes?

56:33.223 --> 56:35.350
Fuck.

56:35.425 --> 56:37.586
Give me some bread, I'll do it.

56:49.940 --> 56:51.339
Even though,

56:51.775 --> 56:53.242
remember...

56:54.011 --> 56:55.774
I'm the fucking star here.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.746
You two got that?

57:04.922 --> 57:06.685
Man, she has gotten wacky.

57:06.757 --> 57:09.191
You are a grouchy motherfucker.

57:09.259 --> 57:11.227
She's just happy to be out.

57:11.295 --> 57:13.695
You don't know her
like I know her, man.

57:14.197 --> 57:15.721
She's changed.

57:18.702 --> 57:21.296
Another step in my experiment, my dear.

57:21.405 --> 57:23.373
Ramona is now a gorilla.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.237
Ramona? This is Ramona?

57:25.309 --> 57:26.901
Go fish.

57:28.779 --> 57:30.576
Man, I'm bored.

57:30.647 --> 57:33.207
- Fours.
- Fours.

57:33.283 --> 57:36.480
I said I'm fucking bored.

57:36.586 --> 57:38.952
Christ, we just sprang you from the joint.

57:39.056 --> 57:41.889
Ain't that enough excitement
for one fucking day?

57:41.959 --> 57:46.896
First off, I've been sitting around
for 10 fucking years doing fuck all.

57:47.631 --> 57:49.929
Fuck, see, I need some action.

57:50.334 --> 57:52.564
Secondly, nobody asked you.

57:52.970 --> 57:55.097
Last thing we need
is you getting some action.

57:55.172 --> 57:56.799
Oh, man.

57:56.907 --> 57:58.772
- Come on.
- Drop it.

57:58.842 --> 58:00.002
"Drop it."

58:00.911 --> 58:04.779
Here, take it. Now calm the fuck down.

58:05.949 --> 58:08.281
I can't believe
you were holding out on me.

58:09.186 --> 58:10.778
Uh, you got any fours?

58:11.688 --> 58:13.087
Fuck, what, are you cheating?

58:13.156 --> 58:15.317
All right.

58:15.425 --> 58:17.620
What are you laughing at?

58:17.694 --> 58:19.753
I just wiped your ass out.

58:19.830 --> 58:21.923
I'm the one who should be laughing now.

58:21.999 --> 58:23.330
That's good, that's good shit.

58:23.433 --> 58:24.764
Fours.

58:27.604 --> 58:29.265
Yes.

58:30.107 --> 58:31.165
Queens.

58:31.274 --> 58:35.210
- So good, I'm gonna have so much fun.
- Nines.

58:37.948 --> 58:38.948
Yeah, good.

58:39.016 --> 58:40.483
Tens.

58:42.319 --> 58:43.980
Threes.

58:45.455 --> 58:46.683
Go fish.

58:49.626 --> 58:51.025
Hey.

58:51.128 --> 58:53.392
Whoa. Where do you think you're going?

58:54.664 --> 58:56.996
Uh, I'm just going to the soda machine.

58:57.534 --> 58:59.161
Is that okay with you?

59:00.170 --> 59:02.468
This shit, it's gonna make me parched.

59:03.373 --> 59:07.139
Okay, you got ten minutes,
and I'm counting.

59:08.412 --> 59:10.903
- Shit, man.
- One-1,000.

59:11.014 --> 59:14.814
If it's gonna be like this,
just take me back to the fucking cage.

59:14.885 --> 59:16.011
Two-1,000.

59:17.020 --> 59:18.248
Three-1,000.

59:18.355 --> 59:20.016
- Go fish.
- Hey.

59:44.281 --> 59:45.748
Hey, sexy.

59:46.416 --> 59:48.077
Are you eyeballing me?

59:48.185 --> 59:51.416
No, I'm just walking.

59:51.521 --> 59:53.455
Okay, just walking.

59:54.257 --> 59:56.623
Tell me the truth.

59:58.895 --> 01:00:02.262
My buddy and I
are having a Halloween party

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:03.855
with those ladies over there,

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:07.097
and maybe, uh,
wondering if you'd like to join us?

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:08.796
How about this?

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:11.237
Ditch those losers and come with me.

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:13.402
I got what you need.

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:16.436
How much?

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:18.980
Don't worry about money, honey.

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.947
This party's free.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:22.444
Come on.

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:25.715
We'll have so much fun.

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:28.485
I ain't looking
to rain on this reunion parade...

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:31.417
but what exactly is our next move?

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:35.161
Uh, I have no idea.

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:38.757
Truthfully, I never thought
we'd make it this far.

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:42.938
I was thinking maybe
we get into the movies.

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:45.634
Huh.

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:49.007
Movies? Yeah, that's a new one.

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:53.276
You know, like, XXX movies, right?
That's where the money's at

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:56.808
'cause people love watching
other people fucking.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.321
- That's true.
- So, our first movie, right?

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:03.149
The Salami Man.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.855
This guy goes around
house to house selling salami.

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:10.421
Every time he rings the bell,
ding-dong, opens it up.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.263
Woman says,

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:14.803
"Show me your salami, motherfucker."

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:16.168
That'll be the catch phrase.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:21.609
Every one of them,
"Show me your salami, motherfucker."

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:22.872
Hal.

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:23.979
Yeah.

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:26.174
- Bends her ass over, fucks her up the ass.
- Right.

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:29.684
Dog's watching, whole time,
dog's in there...

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:32.949
Right? No fucking the dog,
but we bring the dog in.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:34.285
Why not?

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:37.793
- I'm not into dog fucking.
- Maybe in the sequel.

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.852
Maybe in the sequel.

01:01:39.963 --> 01:01:41.021
That's where it's at.

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:42.792
Yeah, man, I like it.

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:47.030
We're gonna call our company
Dirty Filthy Sluts Incorporated.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:48.229
Okay.

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:50.169
Yeah, I dig the name.

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:53.498
So, what kind of party do you wanna have?

01:01:53.577 --> 01:01:58.708
Like a Christmas party or birthday party?

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:01.807
Oh, you wanted to still have
a Halloween party?

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:07.520
No, the one the girls were gonna have.

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.052
A love party.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.526
Let's have a soda party first.

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:14.154
Can you buy me one?

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.498
Sure.

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:21.565
What flavor?

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:24.333
The one that's gonna give me
the most buzz.

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:29.872
Uh... Orange.

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:32.037
Cola.

01:02:33.016 --> 01:02:34.449
Root beer.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:38.277
- It's probably grape.
- Yum.

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:51.133
It's funny, you, uh,
look like the girl that's on TV.

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:52.701
Oh, really?

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.803
Well, it couldn't be.

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.701
It's the one that escaped from prison.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.263
No, that's me.

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:01.373
It's me.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.222
- Well, enjoy your soda.
- Thanks.

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:18.158
I should get back to my friends.

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:19.819
Uh-uh-uh.

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:21.760
I still wanna party.

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:24.059
I don't.

01:03:29.572 --> 01:03:32.268
Five innocent people
were butchered last night

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:36.142
by escaped convicts
Otis Driftwood, Baby Firefly

01:03:36.246 --> 01:03:38.942
and a third assailant, W.F. Coltrane.

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:41.779
Fuck, I hate that picture.

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.785
I'm George Glass reporting.

01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:50.751
Fuck, we're on the tube
every fucking five minutes.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:51.953
We better go find her.

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:55.759
By now she's probably
hitched a ride to fuck knows where.

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:59.325
Hold.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:07.467
I have the answer to all of Our problems.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:13.043
I know exactly what we should do.

01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:15.182
Yeah, but that's impossible.

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:20.050
Why is that impossible?

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:23.182
J' Because the problem is you I.

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:25.818
Fuck you, and dig this idea.

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:29.124
Mexico.

01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:31.664
That's not a bad idea.

01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:34.898
- No one's looking for us there.
- No, they ain't.

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:37.131
Yeah, but none of us speak Mexican.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.573
Fuck, man, how hard can it be?
Fucking little kids speak it.

01:04:39.676 --> 01:04:41.701
I vote south of the border, man.

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:43.335
South of the border.

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:47.412
- Mexico.
- Si, si, si.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.314
Man.

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.849
Is that fucking blood?

01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:58.986
Yeah, um, I had a little trouble
at the soda machine.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:03.328
Oh, fuck. Okay, come on, into the car.
Let's get out of here, come on.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.664
- Mexico.
- Grab something.

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:10.206
Grab the guns, get your shit together,
let's get the fuck out of here.

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:11.570
Goddamn it.

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:16.679
- Ten fucking minutes.
- That's all I need.

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:46.870
Well,

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:51.437
if we were looking to hide out
in the armpit of "La Cucaracha"

01:05:51.548 --> 01:05:54.073
next to the cunt end of nowhere,

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:55.947
I'd say mission accomplished.

01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:00.715
Does look like there's a party
going on down there.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.588
Hey, man,
let me get an eyeball on this situation.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.060
I could use a party.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.163
Fuck.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.965
Yep.

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:15.060
Looks like this party
crawled up its own ass and died.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.765
Shit, man.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.331
I expected a little more out of Mexico.

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:23.412
Mmm.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.505
Goddamn, this girl needs a shower.

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:28.145
Smell me.

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:31.584
- No, no.
- Party pooper.

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:34.848
- Okay.
- Party pooper.

01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:37.518
There's some kind of hotel down there.

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:40.027
I guess we could hole up there
for a couple of days.

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.289
Let's do it.

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:43.855
Yeah.

01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:48.002
Come on, is that your best shot?

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.769
Oh, fuck, man.

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:53.936
You run this joint?

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:57.166
Run this joint? I own this joint.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.867
I am Carlos.

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:00.068
I'm king of Durango.

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:03.043
I am a councilman, alderman,
fireman, policeman,

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:06.081
and sometimes, when necessary,
I am the undertaker.

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:08.680
Who died and made you king of Mexico?

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:09.945
Huh?

01:08:10.053 --> 01:08:11.281
What do you mean by that?

01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:14.285
Hey, can we get down to business?

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.755
Yeah, we need a room.

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.621
Ah, well, you have come
to the right place.

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:19.904
I got the best motherfucking room
in all Durango for you.

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.122
Sebastian.

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:23.595
Sebastian.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.295
Get your lazy ass out here
and help the lady with her bag.

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:29.737
Man, don't...

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:32.536
- Do I pay you to sleep?
- Carlos, I was painting.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:35.600
Painting, no wonder
our establishment is in the toilet.

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:38.305
Help the lady.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.085
Yeah, don't worry about him.

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:46.814
I know he looks like a monster
but he's gentle as a baby rattlesnake.

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:50.323
Yeah, well, there's one thing
I ain't afraid of, It's monsters.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.756
Senorita.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:54.229
- The bow and arrow?
- Yeah.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.925
- Okay.
- All right now, follow me.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.968
Presidential suite awaits.

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:04.667
And, well, here it is, Durango's finest.

01:09:04.774 --> 01:09:06.604
Everything you'll need is right here.

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:09.941
There is your entertainment center,
there is your library

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:11.604
and your very own commode.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.582
- Commode?
- That's right. Your very own.

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:19.312
I take it pissing in the streets is the
only excitement you have around here.

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:20.616
Huh?

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:23.991
Ramon, what the hell
are you doing down there?

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:25.526
Take it to the alley.

01:09:25.627 --> 01:09:27.118
Beautiful.

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:29.426
Anyway, I'll let you guys settle in,

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:32.524
and once you're done settling in,
why don't you come down to the saloon,

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:36.332
Lobo Blanco,
I will hook you motherfuckers up.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.372
And you, I know you like the ladies.

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:40.999
Yeah, depends on the ladies.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:43.305
Well, if you like them
with the big ol' sloppyjugs

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:46.006
and the big ol' swampy ass,
then I got three for you.

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:49.345
Bella, Princesa and Juanita.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:52.319
Names aren't that important.

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:54.287
Well, enough of my yakking.

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:56.481
Come on, Sebastian.

01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:02.628
What do you think?

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.690
Any one of them recognize us?

01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:06.200
Those creeps?

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:09.328
Nah, they didn't recognize shit.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.336
Man, Mexico sucks.

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:53.415
Yeah.

01:10:53.516 --> 01:10:57.543
Aquarius, I got something
I know you're gonna wanna know all about.

01:10:57.887 --> 01:10:58.887
Who is this?

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:00.851
This is Carlos.

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.891
I know a lot of motherfuckers
named Carlos.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:04.639
Well, this is
the motherfucker named Carlos

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:07.219
that hooked you up
with 15 kilos of pure snow.

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:09.856
And you got paid. What do you want?

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:13.368
Well, how about a pot of gold
at the end Of the rainbow?

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:15.131
How about you go fuck yourself?

01:11:15.238 --> 01:11:17.934
Hey, hey, brother, brother, hold on.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:21.100
'Cause I got something
that you've been looking high and low for.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:23.945
I'm listening.

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:25.877
Those fuckers that killed your daddy,

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:29.406
they just rolled into town
without a motherfucking care in the world.

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:31.385
And I know exactly where they are,

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:34.480
and I know exactly how to keep them
safe and sound till you get here.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:38.056
What exactly is it gonna take
to keep them safe?

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:42.154
I need enough dough to get my ass out of
Mexico permanently, so how about...

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.260
$10,000 American.

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:46.601
Done.

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:49.001
That was easy, how about 20,000?

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:50.305
Don't fuck with me.

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:53.739
Oh, I'm not fucking with you,
so 10,000 it is.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.142
- One more thing.
- Yeah, what's that?

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:58.303
Have three coffins waiting.

01:11:58.748 --> 01:12:00.739
You got that, no problem.

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:11.350
Revenge is coming, Papa.

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:14.524
Revenge is coming.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.449
Otis.

01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:45.961
Otis.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:50.627
Otis.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.204
Yeah?

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.804
You ever think maybe it's not worth it?

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.400
What?

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:03.378
I don't know, anything.

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:08.809
Thinking about Cutter?

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:10.986
Yeah.

01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:15.680
The old bastard
had a pretty good run.

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.426
Did more living than most fuckers.

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:24.762
Besides, we all get fucked in the end.

01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:29.895
I mean, what else is there?

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:34.868
Nothing, I guess.

01:13:36.379 --> 01:13:37.869
It's just weird.

01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:39.675
What?

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:44.508
Everybody's gone. It's just the two of us.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:47.579
Yeah, that's the past.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:50.090
Hey, I'm here and down for anything.

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:51.625
I mean, the two of us?

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:54.355
That's the future.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:58.366
Come on, man, shit, what am I,
fucking invisible or what?

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:00.861
The three of us.

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:02.537
Yeah.

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:04.766
I mean, we can still do
a lot Of destruction

01:14:04.874 --> 01:14:06.808
in this fucked up, crazy world.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:08.610
You think?

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:10.402
Fuck, yeah.

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:12.140
Goddamn right.

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:15.106
Well, okay.

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:22.584
Let's go get fucked up.

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:24.717
And do some fucked up shit?

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:27.319
Sis, what other kind is there?

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.690
Friends, how are you?

01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:40.462
Come on in, join the party.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.232
I see that the glamour
of my fine establishment

01:15:43.339 --> 01:15:44.670
has pulled you right in.

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.970
- Hey, where's the drinks?
- Tequila.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:50.012
First one's on the house,
then you pay for the rest.

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:53.139
Carlos here got to make a living.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:56.810
- All right, to Mexico.
- Mexico.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.551
All right.

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:02.818
Princesa, Juanita, ven aca', pronto.

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:05.357
Hola, baby.

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:07.089
Baby, come on in.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:09.087
I'm happy.

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:12.258
You're not a lady that happens
to like the ladies, are you?

01:16:12.368 --> 01:16:14.598
We'll see how the evening goes.

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:16.364
You don't like me, mami?

01:16:16.439 --> 01:16:19.203
You're all right, kid,
but I wanna know what's going on outside.

01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:23.605
Oh, them? The gentlemen of this town

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:26.237
are having their annual
knife throwing contest.

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:29.283
They like to show off their machismo.

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:32.548
Mmm, I'm gonna get in on that
and show them some of mine.

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:34.179
Well, you go ahead.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.587
Yo, give me the knife.

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:46.224
Come here. You look just fine to me,
my little hot taco.

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.361
- Yeah.
- No, I no work with her.

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.632
- Well, fuck you.
- You like her?

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:52.070
Yes, she's nice.

01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:53.904
Well, problem solved.

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:57.935
You can ride all night with us
until your dick falls off.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:00.639
Well, that's what I'm afraid of.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.615
I'll take that, motherfucker.

01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:06.483
And you're gonna pay for that, too,
motherfucker.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:24.303
This gringa bitch thinks it's funny.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.771
How about we cut you?

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:28.332
Not much laughing then, huh?

01:17:28.444 --> 01:17:31.140
Now, hold on, gentlemen.
Hold on, just calm down.

01:17:31.247 --> 01:17:33.738
Little lady wants to play.

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.477
What are we working with?

01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:37.650
This much.

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:40.813
Gentlemen, put up or shut up.

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:44.491
Okay, I can work with that.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:46.518
Me too.

01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:49.097
I'll hold these for safekeeping.

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:52.760
Keep the game on the up and up,
no hanky-panky double-dealing here.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.200
I run a clean game.

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:56.294
I go first, I am best.

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:09.446
That way Goldilocks can see that
Diego is master of the blade.

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.152
Well, now...

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:24.564
I should call that
seven-and-a-quarter inches.

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:27.158
That's pretty good if you're measuring
your ding-a-ling.

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:32.872
There's too much noise. Too much noise.

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:37.002
Step aside.
Let me show you how to kill the demon.

01:18:38.514 --> 01:18:39.640
Watch and learn.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.515
Whoo-y, now.

01:18:48.691 --> 01:18:52.422
That one cold went two inches.
That's gonna be a tough one to beat.

01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:55.019
I think you have wasted your money.

01:18:55.898 --> 01:19:00.062
Maybe you'll pay me another way, huh?

01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:03.434
Show me your real Goldilocks.

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:05.097
Hold there, come on,

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:08.074
don't be counting your peckers
before they hatch there.

01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:10.042
Little lady's got to give it a go.

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:13.677
Such a big knife.

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:17.013
What? You think I can't handle this?

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.350
I've got something for you to handle.

01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:24.354
You better be careful,
I might miss and cut it off.

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:27.958
Enough talk. Throw.

01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:30.429
Don't forget the tequila.

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.261
Rules are the rules.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:37.129
Look, she's afraid to drink.

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:46.403
It's called a dramatic pause.

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:48.780
Helps to create a little suspense.

01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:52.712
You never know what might happen.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.112
Will I miss?

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:57.656
Or will I...

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:03.263
Goddamn!

01:20:03.332 --> 01:20:04.629
How about a missionary/2.

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:06.564
Pay up, suckers!

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:10.736
Here you go, here you go, here you go.

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:13.136
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:14.607
Hey, all righty.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:08.283
That's it.

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:11.120
Oh, yeah.

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:14.957
Bella, Bella, Bella.

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:17.931
Where have you been all my life?

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:21.060
Boy.

01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:23.798
Right here, papi.

01:22:23.906 --> 01:22:27.205
Waiting for you to take me away from here.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:32.077
Well, ass cakes, the wait is over.

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:33.580
Si.

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:36.584
I'm gonna whip you away
from this little shithole...

01:22:37.753 --> 01:22:39.983
and put you into the movies.

01:22:41.824 --> 01:22:43.758
- Yeah.
- You're gonna take me to Hollywood?

01:22:43.826 --> 01:22:45.259
Uh-huh.

01:22:46.395 --> 01:22:48.056
Something like that, yeah.

01:22:55.838 --> 01:22:57.430
Fuck.

01:22:58.407 --> 01:22:59.635
Hold on.

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:23.363
Hi, I bring breakfast. Mayl come in?

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:26.624
Right on. Yeah, I'm starving.

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:28.101
- Come on in.
- All right.

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:31.503
These are arroz con frijoles.

01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:32.699
What's that?

01:23:32.808 --> 01:23:34.708
Rice and beans.

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:36.937
Drop on table, man.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.310
No, hey, man, have a seat.

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:41.679
- I'm sick of eating alone.
- Okay.

01:23:44.553 --> 01:23:48.045
Besides, I don't know
where my fucking brothers are at.

01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:52.387
They were just with
the town bicycle chicas.

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:53.861
Huh?

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:58.228
The bicycle girls,
everyone in town has had a ride.

01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:00.368
Nah, ljoke.

01:24:00.469 --> 01:24:02.232
That's funny.

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:03.966
That's good.

01:24:04.072 --> 01:24:08.304
There's gonna be some weird looking babies
popping out in nine months then.

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:09.867
Yeah, maybe with two heads.

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:17.150
- That's scary.
- You're so funny.

01:24:18.687 --> 01:24:21.417
Thank you. Gracias.

01:24:21.857 --> 01:24:23.222
You know...

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:27.654
you kind of remind me of my brother Tiny.

01:24:28.664 --> 01:24:31.861
- Tiny.
- I mean, he was really huge

01:24:31.934 --> 01:24:34.198
and you're pretty small,

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:38.171
but you guys have the same vibe.

01:24:38.707 --> 01:24:42.768
No, no, no, I'm horrible.

01:24:42.878 --> 01:24:45.210
He was horrible too.

01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:51.115
I thought he was beautiful
in this weird kind of way though.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:58.188
My daddy always said,

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.718
"Anything one of a kind
is pretty special."

01:25:01.797 --> 01:25:05.426
Well, your papa is a very wise man.

01:25:06.368 --> 01:25:09.030
And he... I bet he was very, very handsome

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:12.232
to have such
a beautiful, beautiful daughter.

01:25:13.742 --> 01:25:15.232
Yeah, I guess so.

01:25:40.569 --> 01:25:41.831
Senor Otis.

01:25:43.772 --> 01:25:45.797
Yeah. NO speak the Spanish.

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:48.976
Fucking loco.

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:51.068
Yeah, I love you too.

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:03.114
Ah!

01:26:07.596 --> 01:26:10.258
Is this what you eat for breakfast here?

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:13.199
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:15.927
- I can dig.
- That's good.

01:26:19.608 --> 01:26:22.975
Okay, this is enough for me.
I'm starting to feel funny.

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:26.307
- That just means it's working.
- Okay.

01:26:39.061 --> 01:26:41.495
That's it. Leave it on that one.

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:43.892
I love this movie.

01:26:45.801 --> 01:26:49.066
What is this? I don't like it.

01:26:49.171 --> 01:26:53.699
That's Lon Chaney as Quasimodo, baby.
It don't get any better than that.

01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:56.573
Although Charles Laughton
was pretty fucking great too.

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:59.711
But he's so ugly.

01:27:03.585 --> 01:27:06.019
"I never realized till now..."

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:09.916
how ugly I am...

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:15.155
"and that's because you're so beautiful."

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:23.836
You're so, so crazy.

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:26.703
- Loco.
- Loco.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:33.339
Oh, my God, she does look like you.
He's eating her pussy.

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:35.508
Look at that. He's loving it.
It's a cactus!

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:38.280
I find some more tequila.

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:44.715
I wanna get the taste of you two
out of my fucking mouth.

01:27:44.793 --> 01:27:47.728
- IAy!
- Fuck you. We taste good.

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:54.186
Hey, check it out.

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.023
That's weird.

01:28:59.134 --> 01:29:01.694
It's so trippy, man. What's going on?

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:06.971
Mucho, mucho trouble.

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:08.704
Why? Who are they?

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:11.643
They call themselves the Black Satans.
They're killers.

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:14.978
If they're here, it's a very,
very bad day for someone.

01:29:20.989 --> 01:29:23.184
Fuck them. Why's that fucker
pointing up here at me?

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:24.669
I... I think they're hereto kill you.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:26.160
Fuck, man. I got to warn Otis.

01:29:26.228 --> 01:29:27.695
No, no, no. You hide. I tell him.

01:29:27.796 --> 01:29:30.162
- I don't fucking hide.
- Pleasel Just hide.

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.386
I love this bit.

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:19.775
This...

01:30:21.116 --> 01:30:22.583
I'll get it.

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:33.955
What the fuck?

01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:36.119
What are you talking about?

01:30:38.233 --> 01:30:40.064
He says Satan is coming to kill you.

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:42.593
How can Satan kill me? I am fucking Satan!

01:30:42.704 --> 01:30:43.944
You have to hide, papi.

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:47.805
No, no. I get it. [Get it. I get it. Shh!

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:10.449
You dumb bitch, you got me
in the fucking neck! Kill you.

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:53.256
Who the fuck do you think you are,
kicking in my fucking door?

01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:58.395
Hey, asshole, I'm talking to you.

01:33:59.267 --> 01:34:00.427
Yeah, you.

01:34:01.836 --> 01:34:02.894
Oh.

01:34:03.505 --> 01:34:04.836
You want some of this?

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:09.235
I'm sorry, you're too late.

01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:11.344
I have a boyfriend now.

01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:13.743
Yeah? Where is he?

01:34:13.815 --> 01:34:15.146
Who?

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:18.777
Mira, cabrona,
you tired-ass, filthy fucking puta.

01:34:19.287 --> 01:34:21.687
You better think about it a little harder.

01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:26.521
Wait a second, I know that voice.

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:31.922
Francisco Mendoza Chavez.

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:35.796
You got me.

01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:43.475
You don't scare me.

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:45.809
Get the fuck out of here.

01:35:00.995 --> 01:35:02.792
How many bullets do you have left?

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:07.131
- Uno.
- Fuck.

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:08.294
Make it count.

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:10.796
Make it the magic bullet.

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:14.899
Hey, you have three seconds,
then we kill you.

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:17.808
Uno.

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:20.313
Dos.

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:23.406
Three, motherfucker!

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:50.104
What took you so long, motherfucker?

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:53.180
Cavalry comes when it comes, big brother.

01:35:56.184 --> 01:35:57.378
What the fuck!

01:36:01.723 --> 01:36:04.214
Next time, make sure
they're all the way dead.

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:11.123
Where the fuck's the lollipop kid going?

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:13.126
Back to Oz.

01:36:18.706 --> 01:36:20.799
Look at this skull fucker.

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:24.868
Still clinging
to his worthless little life.

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:26.277
Time's up.

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:36.723
Fuck you!

01:36:48.236 --> 01:36:50.500
Now we can have a real Day of the Dead.

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:16.425
Should be down this way.

01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:18.990
Just don't shoot me in the ass, man.

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.261
This time, get out of my fucking way then.

01:37:21.336 --> 01:37:22.530
Okay, motherfucker.

01:37:47.729 --> 01:37:52.029
Hola, muchacho. I suggest
you drop that boom-boom stick

01:37:52.133 --> 01:37:54.465
or your mug is gonna be
decorating that wall.

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:56.867
- Fuck me.
- You got that right.

01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:18.183
Going somewhere, motherfucker?

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:21.990
Yeah, matter of fact, I was thinking of
going on a little vacation.

01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:24.361
- Well, think again.
- No, man, you think again!

01:38:24.432 --> 01:38:25.660
You can't beat this.

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:28.861
Once the Black Satans arrive,
man, it's already over.

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:30.927
Man, you're messing with the wrong dudes.

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:32.883
Man, you brought this down
on yourself and everybody else.

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:35.552
Man, I'm just the middle man stuck in
the middle of the middle Of the middle!

01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:37.703
The rat sure can squeak.

01:38:37.779 --> 01:38:39.178
Squeak me a story, rat.

01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:42.614
Man, I'm telling you, man,
you should just go and die easy.

01:38:42.717 --> 01:38:45.584
You can't beat them.
Now get this through your thick skull.

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:48.018
It's over. It's over, man. You can't win.

01:38:48.089 --> 01:38:51.581
Maybe not,
but I got something to tell you, rat.

01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:54.254
- W hat?
- You sure can fucking lose.

01:38:54.362 --> 01:38:56.956
Whoa, hold on, man. Just hold on.

01:38:57.064 --> 01:38:59.726
I'm just a guy trying to survive
from hustle to hustle, man.

01:38:59.801 --> 01:39:02.599
I got nothing against you.
I got nothing against nobody.

01:39:02.703 --> 01:39:05.638
- I mean, I'm a nice guy.
- Go on.

01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:10.439
How about this? We...
We split the money, 50-50?

01:39:11.813 --> 01:39:15.112
60-40? Uh, 70-30?

01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:17.547
How about that? We cool?

01:39:18.586 --> 01:39:21.817
- Yeah, we're cool.
- Oh, man, I knew you'd see it my way.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:31.830
Fucking rat.

01:39:47.615 --> 01:39:49.606
Turn around and see God.

01:39:55.356 --> 01:39:56.789
I've heard a lot about you.

01:39:57.792 --> 01:39:59.157
But now that I see you...

01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:01.492
I know it's all bullshit.

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:04.290
Because you're nothing.

01:40:08.102 --> 01:40:10.161
You motherfuck...

01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:38.229
I don't understand.

01:40:43.304 --> 01:40:46.398
Looks like our little Indian's warpath
has come to a sudden end.

01:40:54.582 --> 01:40:56.413
You're not even worth a bullet.

01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:05.223
I think your brother
has left you to rot.

01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:08.192
I'm not surprised.

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:15.198
Come on out!

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:18.330
It's time to fill these boxes!

01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:26.007
One bullet...

01:41:27.548 --> 01:41:29.379
for every second you make me wait.

01:41:31.953 --> 01:41:33.045
Jesus!

01:41:43.965 --> 01:41:45.227
Look at that.

01:41:46.601 --> 01:41:48.694
The last member
of our funeral party has arrived.

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.403
You should have stayed in prison.

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:57.308
Being a free man has been
hazardous to your health.

01:41:58.546 --> 01:42:02.812
At this point,
life seems hazardous to my health.

01:42:02.917 --> 01:42:05.579
Yes, but that problem will soon be solved.

01:42:06.587 --> 01:42:09.556
Let her go.
She's got nothing to do with this shit.

01:42:09.624 --> 01:42:12.115
- Yes, I do!
- Shut the fuck up, Baby.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.257
Get these ropes off me and I'll kill
every fucker here with my bare hands.

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:18.321
Goddamn it,
I'm trying to save your fucking life!

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:19.922
Fuck!

01:42:20.668 --> 01:42:22.829
- It's all me.
- True.

01:42:22.937 --> 01:42:27.306
But you, above anyone else,
should understand that family is family.

01:42:27.408 --> 01:42:30.309
So she'll pay for your sins,
just as hard as you do.

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.469
But since I'm a nice guy...

01:42:35.116 --> 01:42:37.516
I'm gonna let you pick who dies first.

01:42:48.963 --> 01:42:50.157
You want me?

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.199
How about you and me?

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:58.031
No guns.

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:01.705
Just two machetes.

01:43:03.144 --> 01:43:04.702
Makes no difference to me.

01:43:05.312 --> 01:43:06.506
Drop your weapon.

01:43:06.614 --> 01:43:09.139
See if you got what it takes
to keep blondie alive.

01:43:10.718 --> 01:43:12.049
What do you think, Foxy?

01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:14.481
I think we're fucked, man.

01:43:15.156 --> 01:43:16.817
No way! Fucking kill him!

01:43:17.525 --> 01:43:20.824
Kill him! Kill him! Kill them all!

01:43:24.065 --> 01:43:25.532
What's it gonna be?

01:43:26.734 --> 01:43:29.362
You see, without a gun...

01:43:31.906 --> 01:43:33.339
he's nothing.

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:44.008
Okay.

01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:45.981
No fucking rules.

01:43:46.921 --> 01:43:48.548
Last man alive wins.

01:43:56.564 --> 01:43:57.826
Get him!

01:44:16.383 --> 01:44:18.578
Is that your blood already/2 Yeah.

01:44:18.686 --> 01:44:20.085
Come on, Otis!

01:44:24.225 --> 01:44:26.352
- Kill him!
- Get up!

01:44:28.362 --> 01:44:29.761
Nice!

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:43.303
Kill him!

01:44:44.979 --> 01:44:46.071
Good one!

01:45:00.895 --> 01:45:02.829
- I bring you a present.
- Thank you.

01:45:07.001 --> 01:45:08.298
I come to save you.

01:45:16.844 --> 01:45:18.141
Get him!

01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:23.474
Hal.

01:45:37.131 --> 01:45:38.689
Fuck, no! Where is she?

01:45:39.033 --> 01:45:40.830
Sanctuary!

01:45:40.935 --> 01:45:42.527
Sanctuary!

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:44.501
I've had enough of your shit,
motherfucker!

01:46:23.911 --> 01:46:25.242
Nice gun.

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.004
I'll take that.

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:32.143
So you got me. Now what?

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:35.321
Now I guess she'll just slit
your fucking throat.

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.490
I got a better idea.

01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:44.520
What are you waiting for?

01:46:45.432 --> 01:46:46.558
Nothing.

01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:51.060
Waiting for him to break.

01:46:52.439 --> 01:46:55.272
Something in the eyes snaps.

01:46:58.445 --> 01:47:01.573
- Was that it?
- No. Keep watching.

01:47:04.852 --> 01:47:07.616
He looks pretty goddamn broken to me.

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:15.960
- I'm betting that was it.
- That was it.

01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:22.929
Make sure he's covered.
I want him good and crispy.

01:47:23.771 --> 01:47:26.035
I know how to cook a fucking corpse.

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:27.971
Any last words?

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:30.233
Yeah.

01:47:31.779 --> 01:47:33.041
Fuck you.

01:47:33.948 --> 01:47:35.779
Fuck you!

01:47:35.883 --> 01:47:37.282
They always say that.

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:38.749
Fuck you!

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:42.947
Adi6s, motherfucker!

01:47:55.436 --> 01:47:56.436
Don't, man.
