00:34.952 --> 00:37.034
We passed the middle of nowhere
about an hour ago.

00:37.121 --> 00:40.329
That’s not a legitimate

00:57.058 --> 00:58.719
So where are the clothes?
There’s no clothes.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.765
Well, when you wanna
get rid of a body,

01:00.853 --> 01:02.844
you don’t want nothing between
the teeth and the meat.

Yeah, we get that.

Mm-hmm.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.698

Ah. The serial number...

Great. That’s all I need.

Well—
Pretty much.

01:50.236 --> 01:51.772
Yeah, I’d say pretty much.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.604
So, Nozik— he worked here
as a security guard?

Yes. I’m the museum’s

Body dump.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.204
Murder?

02:05.876 --> 02:08.583
Who would murder Sam?
Traditionally
that is the question we ask.

02:08.671 --> 02:11.879
Did he have any problems, issues—
you know, things like that?

02:11.966 --> 02:14.252
[Clicks Tongue]
There’s something
you should see.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.460
That’s Sam Nozik?

02:17.555 --> 02:19.511
Yes. He failed to report
for work 10 days ago.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.135
Seventy-two hours later,
we reported him missing.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.512
That’s the last footage
we have of Sam.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.559
What is he doing?

02:26.647 --> 02:29.855
Something sneaky.
That’s for sure.
I mean, look at him.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.401
He stole an 18th-century
nautical chart fragment.

02:35.406 --> 02:36.896
Our most recent acquisition.

02:37.033 --> 02:39.319
What’s it worth?
Well, that depends
who you talk to.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.526
Well, we’re talking to you.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.327
It’s worthless until
it’s authenticated.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.451
Authenticated as what?

02:46.542 --> 02:48.282
The final resting place...

Santa Esperanza.

02:51.714 --> 02:55.878
She sank during a storm
in the spring of 1774.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.504
Treasure ship?

02:57.595 --> 03:00.928
So when you say “worthless,”
what you actually mean
is the exact opposite.

03:01.015 --> 03:03.006
No.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.011
Yes. | get your point.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.764
But there have literally
been dozens of these
things over the years,

03:07.855 --> 03:10.767
and none has turned out
to be authentic.

03:10.858 --> 03:14.851
When it comes to such things,
it’s realistic to be a pessimist.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.187
Well, it looks like your
security guard was an optimist.

03:20.493 --> 03:22.825

who use a forked stick...

03:22.953 --> 03:25.365

No. Bones, I’m not trying
to have a conversation
with you here.

What I’m saying to you is...

03:35.841 --> 03:38.253
I actually know
somebody I can put
on the case.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.130
To find the treasure?

03:40.221 --> 03:42.553
Treasure maps
have gotten people killed
for hundreds of years.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.928
It’s a chart, Booth.
Charts reference water.
Maps reference land.

to resolve.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.675
I think you mean
“philosophical,”

04:21.762 --> 04:25.095

to “ninja versus samurai.”

04:25.224 --> 04:27.306

He’s right.

between those two statements?

33:08.737 --> 33:10.443
that joins everything.

33:10.531 --> 33:13.489
Everything is connected
to everything else.

33:13.576 --> 33:15.817
I mean, this fact is nearly
impossible for us to grasp...

33:15.911 --> 33:18.163
because we are just mollusks—

33:18.247 --> 33:21.455
shut up tight at the bottom
of a dark, cold ocean,

33:21.542 --> 33:24.875
trying to make sense of stars
that we cannot even see.

33:24.962 --> 33:27.374
I challenge everything
because when I do,

33:27.464 --> 33:29.796
a quick bolt of electricity
jolts between two elements...

33:29.884 --> 33:32.000

appeared unconnected.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.961
You call it paranoia.
I call it epiphany.

If you want me to give that up
so I can enjoy a cup
of decaf coffee—

33:40.352 --> 33:42.092
I’m sorry.
I can’t do that.

of this dull world,

Booth, Dr. Hodgins
has something very
important to tell you.

34:39.286 --> 34:41.402
What?
There are three nails
on the chart.

34:41.497 --> 34:44.239
Here. See? Clear as day.
So?

34:44.333 --> 34:48.417
The three nails were
purposely rendered
in a kind of invisible ink.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.836
It reacts to blood,
semen, breast milk.

34:50.923 --> 34:53.835
Let’s just get to the important
part and then we’ll go back
to the boring stuff.

34:53.926 --> 34:57.168
If you want, we can figure out
where to find that treasure.

[Ange/a ]
Since the dawn of na wgation,
latitude has he I/er changed

35:07.731 --> 35:09.016
Everyone was always
in agreement.

35:09.108 --> 35:13.192
The equator is zero degrees.
No question, no debate.

35:13.279 --> 35:15.144
But not longitude.

35:15.239 --> 35:19.778
Now we all agree that
the Greenwich Observatory
is zero degrees longitude.

35:19.868 --> 35:23.156
But back in the olden days,
there were hundreds
of prime meridians,

35:23.247 --> 35:24.612
all of them completely arbitrary.

35:24.707 --> 35:26.698
Where did the ship go down?

35:26.792 --> 35:30.205
The navigator
of the Santa Esperanza...

35:30.296 --> 35:32.753
didn’t base his calculations
on St. Peter’s Basilica?

35:32.840 --> 35:34.751
[Angela ]
No. Because if he had,

35:34.842 --> 35:38.050
the treasure would be exactly
where Walter Sherman
found that girl’s body.

35:39.388 --> 35:42.926
Now, the navigator of the
Santa Esperanza was a Jesuit.

35:43.017 --> 35:45.759
Since this is where
Fidalgo studied,

35:45.853 --> 35:47.809
I’d put my money
on the Copernican Observatory.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.761
[ Booth ]
Look at that.

pretty close together.

But at the bottom of the ocean,

35:54.320 --> 35:56.436
you might as well be
a hundred miles apart.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.985
Do you think that
Walter found this out?

36:01.076 --> 36:03.158
[Angela Scoffs ]
I don’t know how he could have.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.987
[ Booth ]
He did. He’s got the finder power.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.412
Is that real?

36:07.499 --> 36:09.364
Yes. It’s real.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.917
God, I hate that son of a bitch.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.442
The Santa Esperanza
went down right here.

Those are
the exact coordinates.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.703
Have you verified
the location of the wreck?

36:48.791 --> 36:52.283
Once we realized
the navigator was Jesuit,
it was child’s play.

36:57.091 --> 36:58.547
Oh.

36:58.634 --> 37:00.340
Oh, my God.

I apologize.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.025
The navigator
was a secret Jesuit.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.860
What led you
to that conclusion?

37:27.955 --> 37:29.946
Blood on the chart
revealed a secret sign.

37:30.040 --> 37:30.950
Blood?

Your blood, to be precise.

37:35.671 --> 37:37.127
The injured hand
in and of itself...

37:37.214 --> 37:39.580
does not satisfy
the requirements
of reasonable doubt.

37:39.675 --> 37:42.462
I saw a 300-year-old
sextant on Brittany’s boat.

37:42.594 --> 37:46.132
Where else could that
have come from but this place?
Circumstantial at best.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.035
Discussing murder not only
makes it conspiracy,

after me to find me.

have to look the other way.

while under contract to the
