00:17.120 --> 00:18.440
Clear!

00:24.600 --> 00:26.920
- Good son, you came!
- Yes, we got your message.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.640
- She took the boy. They took him.
- The boy?

00:29.760 --> 00:32.240
The son of my daughter.
She took the boy.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.400
Daniel, we gotta go.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.120
- You said she took him.
- There!

00:38.880 --> 00:42.040
Keep your people together.
Go with the people of the Tauri.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.440
Fall back! Fall back!

00:45.600 --> 00:46.720
Daniel!

00:49.480 --> 00:51.400
Sha're.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.840
Teal'c!

02:37.320 --> 02:39.240
Don't move.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.840
Where's the boy?

02:49.560 --> 02:53.520
(distorted) Where you and
the System Lords will never find him.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.160
Don't!

03:02.120 --> 03:03.960
Don't!

03:13.040 --> 03:17.360
- No, Sha're. Fight it!
- (distorted) My host cannot help you.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.680
Sha're...

05:08.040 --> 05:10.320
What happened?

05:10.480 --> 05:12.720
You don't remember?

05:16.760 --> 05:19.000
I'm not sure.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.880
We were on P8X-873.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.960
We were freeing the Abydonians
whom the Goa'uld had taken as slaves.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.600
Kasuf sent for us.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.360
Sha're was there.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.200
Yeah.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.720
She's dead, Daniel.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.200
Sorry.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.840
How?

05:51.600 --> 05:53.800
It is I who am responsible.

06:00.280 --> 06:03.920
I was forced to fire upon
and terminate the life of Sha're.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.480
However, I assure you
it was done only to save your life.

06:11.840 --> 06:12.840
No.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.800
- No?
- No.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.560
They have a sarcophagus.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.840
Her guards put her in the sarcophagus.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.280
She's still out there somewhere alive.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.120
What?

06:33.400 --> 06:36.720
Doctor, can he be taken
out of the infirmary?

06:36.880 --> 06:40.200
We'll have to keep his drip in.
I'll arrange for a wheelchair.

06:40.360 --> 06:44.000
- I'll take him, sir.
- I will accompany you also.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.080
- Kasuf.
- My son.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.640
- It's a sad day for us all.
- No.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.960
This is hard for you
to understand, Kasuf, but...

07:03.120 --> 07:07.360
..the demon inside your daughter
will help her rise again.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.760
Is this true?

07:09.920 --> 07:12.040
Not this time.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.800
I'm sorry.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.760
Why didn't you leave her there?

08:03.080 --> 08:06.880
- They would have saved her.
- There were no "they" Ieft.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.600
We were victorious, Daniel Jackson.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.240
There was no one remaining
to take Sha're to a sarcophagus.

08:15.440 --> 08:20.200
We brought Kasuf to prepare her body
according to Abydonian tradition.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.440
The good news is we managed
to save most of the Abydonians.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.800
And for that... we are eternally grateful.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.960
You should have waited longer.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.720
I would have gotten through to her.

08:49.880 --> 08:54.840
- (O'Neill) She was trying to kill you.
- No, she wasn't trying to kill me.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.920
Amaunet was trying to kill me.

08:57.080 --> 09:00.240
I have seen many humans killed
by Goa'uld ribbon devices.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.480
You would have been dead
in mere seconds had I not acted.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.360
Teal'c did the right thing, Daniel.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.400
I am sorry Sha're is dead.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.680
However, you are my friend.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.320
If I had to do it again,
I would do the same.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.640
Hi.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.120
Hi.

09:58.720 --> 10:02.080
I brought you some of these
chocolate walnut cookies.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.160
Thank you.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.480
You ever really study one of these?

10:10.040 --> 10:11.960
A pen?

10:15.320 --> 10:18.200
I spent years studying
the history of the written word,...

10:18.360 --> 10:21.440
..how cultures recorded things
through the ages,...

10:21.600 --> 10:24.680
..from hammers and chisels
to quills and ink.

10:26.280 --> 10:29.760
But I never stopped once
to recognise the ingenuity...

10:29.920 --> 10:33.320
..of this simple little piece
of technology that we use.

10:35.600 --> 10:40.480
After the first team left me on Abydos,
Sha're saw me writing in my journal...

10:40.640 --> 10:44.240
..and thought the ballpoint
I was using was magic.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.320
A little device like this pen
was such a wonder to her.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.960
The simplest things were a wonder to her.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.880
Daniel, it's healthy
to hold on to those memories.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.840
I couldn't save her.

11:09.080 --> 11:13.160
All those wonders we have at our disposal
and I couldn't save her.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.560
I'm just gonna get some sleep
if you don't mind.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.000
OK.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.640
Let me know if you need anything.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.960
Thank you.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.440
OK.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.120
(Sha're) Hear me, Daniel.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.360
Daniel, you're awake.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.440
He's awake!

12:23.840 --> 12:25.120
Hey...

12:26.480 --> 12:28.720
How do you feel?

12:31.720 --> 12:33.800
- Confused.
- I bet.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.200
- Can you tell me your name?
- Daniel Jackson.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.080
- And what's your birthday?
- July 8th.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.200
- Sha're.
- Yes, husband.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.560
- You're alive.
- I am.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.280
As are most of our people,
thanks be to you.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.760
And thanks be to all of you.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.440
- What happened?
- Amaunet had you in her ribbon device.

12:57.600 --> 13:01.240
- I had no recourse but to fire upon her.
- We took her to the Tok'ra.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.280
They had a captured sarcophagus
and a way to remove the Goa'uld.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.360
Then I was dreaming before.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.960
What?

13:18.040 --> 13:19.960
Nothing.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.600
Uh, maybe we should...

13:27.360 --> 13:29.520
Glad to see you're OK, Daniel.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.920
- He is gonna be OK?
- Oh, it looks that way, yeah.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.560
There are so many things
I wanna say to you...

13:40.720 --> 13:42.640
Daniel.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.520
I only came to tell you about the boy.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.280
What about him?

14:05.120 --> 14:07.040
Daniel?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.800
Are you OK?

14:11.680 --> 14:13.600
No.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.760
- Is Sha're here?
- No.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.040
Do you mean...?

14:24.520 --> 14:27.240
We haven't taken
her body back to Abydos.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.480
Is that what you meant?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.880
Come in.

14:54.040 --> 14:57.360
Dr Jackson!
Good to see you back on your feet.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.080
Yes. Uh... Dr Fraiser just released me.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.720
Is there something I can
help you with, Dr Jackson?

15:05.880 --> 15:07.280
Yes, sir.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.320
- I've come to tender my resignation.
- I won't accept it.

15:11.480 --> 15:17.320
I'm not military, sir, and it's
a free country. Last I checked, anyway.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.520
You're obviously
in an emotional state right now.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.800
You're making rash decisions.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.720
Take some personal time.
Then see how you feel.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.160
That's not necessary, sir.

15:29.640 --> 15:33.160
I joined this programme so that
I could find my wife. I found her.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.320
End of story.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.040
Hey!

15:49.200 --> 15:52.560
You should meet the whiz kid we've got
while you're out of commission.

15:52.720 --> 15:57.200
Robert Rothman. He was my research
assistant when I did my dissertation.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.120
Smart guy.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.320
Uh... Had a good teacher.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.800
- Geek.
- Yes. You used to call me that.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.480
I was talkin' about you.

16:10.640 --> 16:13.800
So... how long are we gonna
be stuck with this guy?

16:14.960 --> 16:16.920
What do you mean?

16:17.080 --> 16:19.400
How long are you gonna be gone?

16:20.320 --> 16:22.720
Didn't General Hammond tell you?

16:22.880 --> 16:25.000
What? That you quit?

16:25.600 --> 16:27.520
Yeah, he told me that.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.800
But, uh... Come on...

16:30.560 --> 16:33.000
We both know you can't stay away.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.920
Then I guess we're both wrong,
cos... I'm gone.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.920
Give it a week. You'll miss me.

16:40.080 --> 16:44.680
Yes, all the salty, bad-tempered insults,
all the illogical arguments...

16:44.840 --> 16:47.120
OK. You'll miss Carter and Teal'c.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.400
I'll miss Carter.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.880
And you'll miss the excitement.

16:57.040 --> 17:01.280
All the new cultures you get to explore,
the living history.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.440
It's the kind of stuff
you can't walk away from.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.280
Jack...

17:06.440 --> 17:11.119
Up until now, every time I set foot through
that gate I was thinking about my wife.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.760
Maybe I'll see her this time.
Maybe this is the one.

17:14.920 --> 17:19.400
Now every time I go through,
it'd just be some... place...

17:20.920 --> 17:23.400
..where that hope used to be.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.320
That's why I can't do it any more.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.880
I hope you understand that.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.960
"The SGC may be the single
most important human endeavour...

17:45.120 --> 17:47.800
..for the future of mankind."

17:47.960 --> 17:49.920
Not bad, huh?

17:50.520 --> 17:52.200
You said that.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.320
The SGC will go on without me.

18:09.080 --> 18:14.000
- Please get out of my way, Teal'c.
- I will. But you must hear me first.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.280
I have a pretty good idea
what you wanna say.

18:17.440 --> 18:22.920
Is there not some form of human ritual
in which I may ask your forgiveness?

18:24.320 --> 18:26.240
No.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.600
Thank you.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.880
You're welcome.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.560
- So.
- So...

18:58.440 --> 19:00.360
So...

19:02.480 --> 19:04.480
Now what?

19:04.640 --> 19:06.640
Now I get on with my life.

19:07.520 --> 19:11.520
- What are you gonna do?
- Hopefully I'll go somewhere... far away.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.160
The most remote dig I can find.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.800
We gonna see you again?

19:18.840 --> 19:21.160
At the funeral.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.240
Now if you'll excuse me...

19:30.760 --> 19:33.040
I seem to have a lot to do.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.120
OK.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.400
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.920
Dr Jackson.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.960
Hear me, Daniel.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.600
Are you ill, my husband?

21:08.480 --> 21:09.720
Apparently.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.440
Go back to sleep.

21:13.600 --> 21:18.240
Tomorrow you will rise and return
to your travels through the Chaapa-ai.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.160
No, I won't.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.080
I don't need to any more.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.920
I've already found you.

21:30.240 --> 21:34.680
You must continue
so you can find the boy.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.600
- Where is he?
- To continue your travels,...

21:40.160 --> 21:42.760
..you must first forgive Teal'c.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.240
He did what is right.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.160
When he killed you?

21:51.120 --> 21:52.720
Yes.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.240
- But you're here.
- Yes.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.560
Now go back to sleep.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.760
Sh...

22:49.600 --> 22:51.520
(prayer chant)

23:15.560 --> 23:19.120
I speak for Sha're,
who can no longer speak for herself.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.680
(speaks ancient Egyptian)

23:27.240 --> 23:30.240
I have spoken no lies,
nor acted with deceit.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.840
(ancient Egyptian)

23:40.120 --> 23:44.240
I was once possessed by a demon
who did these things against my will.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.280
(ancient Egyptian)

23:51.880 --> 23:54.720
The demon is gone
and now I am without sin.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.440
(ancient Egyptian)

24:01.840 --> 24:04.720
Grant me a place
in your blessed dwelling.

24:16.920 --> 24:20.760
If my heart weighs more than a feather,
my soul still contains sin.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.880
If not, may my soul join the god.

24:41.560 --> 24:45.240
By the trial of the great scales,
thy heart is light.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.960
Thy soul has been found true.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.600
Good son.

25:13.760 --> 25:17.280
- It was a beautiful ceremony, good father.
- It was.

25:18.120 --> 25:21.920
- My heart is still burdened.
- Why? Your daughter is with the god.

25:22.920 --> 25:26.560
Yes. But you still have not heard her.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.720
I don't understand.

25:28.880 --> 25:33.400
What she has to say is important
to all of our future.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.280
Go to her.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.840
(speaks ancient Egyptian)

25:52.600 --> 25:54.520
Daniel.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.640
You must forgive Teal'c.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.600
- Yes, you already told me that.
- And together you must find the boy.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.440
Why?

26:09.600 --> 26:13.560
For he is Harsesis.
The one who holds the secrets.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.920
The boy is the son of two Goa'uld hosts.

26:18.400 --> 26:23.600
He contains all the secrets of the Goa'uld.
You must find him.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.600
How?

26:33.400 --> 26:35.320
Hear me, Daniel.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.160
This is Dr Jackson.
I need to speak to Major Carter.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.120
Daniel.

27:12.280 --> 27:15.600
Well, old Doc Jackson!
What are you doin' here?

27:16.000 --> 27:18.680
I need to talk to Sam... alone.

27:20.280 --> 27:24.960
General, I need to... talk to you...

27:25.480 --> 27:27.400
..alone.

27:28.360 --> 27:31.080
- How are they treating you, Robert?
- Oh... Well...

27:31.240 --> 27:34.880
I think they'd rather have you.
Especially Colonel O'Neill.

27:35.240 --> 27:38.600
Well, don't let Jack get to you.
He's just intimidated by you...

27:38.760 --> 27:42.920
..because you're, uh...
you're way smarter than he is.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.800
It is good to see you well, Daniel Jackson.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.760
Teal'c.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.280
You did the right thing.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.560
So... what's up?

28:16.760 --> 28:20.200
How well do you understand
the Goa'uld hand device, how it works?

28:20.360 --> 28:25.160
Well, it uses a modified version of
the power source for the staff weapons...

28:25.320 --> 28:28.320
..which it channels
through amplification crystals...

28:28.480 --> 28:30.600
No. I meant...

28:31.280 --> 28:35.480
- It works by thought control, right?
- Uh, yeah, that's one way to put it.

28:35.640 --> 28:39.600
More like, uh... thought control
amplified with emotion.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.960
- So there is a connection with the mind.
- Yeah, definitely.

28:43.360 --> 28:46.480
So it's possible
to send a thought through it...

28:46.640 --> 28:50.760
..if you had someone in one of those grips
like Sha're had me in?

28:52.520 --> 28:55.640
As far as I know, Daniel,
it's designed to kill.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.560
OK, but it could do both.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.880
Yeah, I suppose it could. Why?

29:02.720 --> 29:05.200
I'm not sure.

29:05.360 --> 29:08.200
I know this may sound
like wishful thinking, but...

29:08.360 --> 29:12.640
..l think Sha're was trying to send a
message to me through the hand device.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.000
What message?

29:20.440 --> 29:22.360
I'm not sure.

29:43.720 --> 29:45.960
Hey, Daniel.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.040
Hi.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.880
How'd you get in here?

29:52.040 --> 29:56.160
You left the base before we could
catch you. We thought we'd see you here.

30:00.360 --> 30:04.520
- How'd you get in here?
- Got sick of waitin', so I let us in.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.160
You... need a new lock, by the way.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.800
Good son,
it is important I speak with you.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.040
What is it, good father?

30:14.200 --> 30:16.600
Colonel O'Neill says
you are leaving his tribe.

30:16.760 --> 30:20.760
That you no longer intend
to go through the Chaapa-ai. Is this so?

30:20.920 --> 30:24.080
- It is.
- This disturbs me greatly.

30:24.520 --> 30:28.520
It gives the people of Abydos security
knowing that you are among the gods,...

30:28.680 --> 30:30.920
..protecting us.

30:31.080 --> 30:35.200
I'm sorry, good father. I joined the SGC
in the hopes of finding Sha're.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.560
That goal is no longer attainable.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.360
So I cannot be among the gods
any more. I hope you understand.

30:41.520 --> 30:45.240
But, Daniel, my daughter wishes you
to travel among the gods.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.320
- She does?
- Yes. So that you can find the boy.

30:54.160 --> 30:57.080
Forgive me, good father.
How do you know that?

30:57.240 --> 31:01.320
Sha're told me. Go! Ask her yourself.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.160
Sha're.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.080
Come to me, Daniel.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.280
(door opens)

33:05.520 --> 33:09.000
- Am I interrupting?
- It is good to see you, Daniel Jackson.

33:22.520 --> 33:23.440
Teal'c...

33:24.320 --> 33:28.880
What happens
if two Goa'ulded hosts have a child?

33:29.040 --> 33:32.320
It is strictly forbidden.
Punishable by death.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.000
Really. Why?

33:36.920 --> 33:39.480
If two hosts were to mate
and produce a child,...

33:39.600 --> 33:42.760
..that child would contain
all the knowledge of the Goa'uld.

33:42.920 --> 33:46.400
So the genetic memory
that Goa'uld have in their DNA...

33:46.560 --> 33:48.760
..is passed on to the human offspring?

33:48.920 --> 33:52.560
That is correct.
Such children are called Harsesis.

33:52.720 --> 33:57.400
These children are hunted down and
destroyed by the Goa'uld with impunity.

33:57.560 --> 34:02.760
So the offspring - the Harsesis -
would contain all the knowledge,...

34:02.920 --> 34:06.560
- ..all the secrets of the Goa'uld that...
- Yes, Daniel.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.679
Daniel Jackson.

34:21.480 --> 34:25.960
It pleases me greatly that
once again you value my knowledge.

34:39.520 --> 34:44.400
General, the guy's got two left feet.
I'm tellin' ya, he slows down the unit.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.920
- Deja vu?
- Deja vu?

34:49.040 --> 34:50.760
Deja vu?

34:52.880 --> 34:57.720
You know, Rothman was a two-time
decathlon champion in college.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.760
- Rothman?
- Two left feet, huh?

35:03.280 --> 35:05.920
Trying to get Robert out of your unit?

35:06.080 --> 35:07.680
Well, yeah.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.320
Any chance of that happening, sir?

35:11.480 --> 35:14.240
Only chance would be
if you reconsider.

35:15.680 --> 35:16.880
OK.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.400
Good! So Rothman's gone...

35:19.560 --> 35:21.800
- What?
- OK.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.880
Are you kidding?

35:25.840 --> 35:29.080
No. I've thought about it
and I've decided I'd like to come back.

35:29.240 --> 35:32.760
May I ask what changed your mind?
You were fairly adamant.

35:33.840 --> 35:37.600
I don't know. Let's just say
there's something through the Stargate...

35:37.760 --> 35:39.920
..that I still have to be the one to find.

35:40.080 --> 35:43.520
See, I miss that. I have no idea
what it means, but I buy it.

35:44.320 --> 35:48.480
- What do you say, General?
- Haven't put through his resignation yet.

35:48.920 --> 35:50.960
Good! So he's in.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.480
So, Bruce Jenner...

35:56.640 --> 35:59.600
- Sit this one out, huh?
- Uh, me?

36:00.720 --> 36:02.640
Why?

36:03.200 --> 36:05.960
You've been reassigned to another unit.

36:06.120 --> 36:08.040
Why?

36:10.760 --> 36:13.160
OK, you're being replaced.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.920
Why?

36:15.080 --> 36:19.680
Because I'm intimidated by your
intelligence. Where's the confusion here?

36:22.600 --> 36:24.520
Daniel.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.200
Daniel Jackson, you're rejoining SG-1 .

36:38.640 --> 36:40.720
Yeah.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.560
Thank you.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.800
Chevron one, engaged.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.760
Carter, grab your samples.

37:07.920 --> 37:11.440
Teal'c, stay with her.
I'm gonna check out that tree line.

37:12.640 --> 37:18.600
Daniel, the UAV showed no big signs of
civilisation - human, Goa'uld or otherwise.

37:18.760 --> 37:21.680
So you want me to look for
little signs of civilisation.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.120
Itsy-bitsy artefacts and...

37:24.280 --> 37:26.720
It's good to have you back.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.560
Hey!

37:43.960 --> 37:47.320
- Where'd he go?
- The address cleared before I got here.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.400
You are finally here.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.840
Yes.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.840
You are the only one
who can save the boy, Daniel.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.600
He's a Harsesis.
He contains all their knowledge.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.360
Amaunet took the Abydonians
as a show,...

38:36.520 --> 38:39.760
..so that Heru-Ur
would not know her true goal.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.840
To take the boy.

38:42.640 --> 38:45.880
She has sent him into hiding
with her closest aide.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.200
Where?

38:56.640 --> 38:58.400
Kheb.

38:58.560 --> 39:01.120
I know a Kheb.
There's a reference in Budge.

39:02.320 --> 39:05.360
It's the mythical place
where Osiris hid from Set.

39:07.160 --> 39:10.520
- Kheb is a myth.
- No.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.360
Where is it?

39:15.320 --> 39:17.800
Promise me you will save the child.

39:20.480 --> 39:22.000
I promise.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.640
I love you, Daniel.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.360
I am sorry, Daniel Jackson.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.840
You did the right thing, Teal'c.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.480
Oh, God.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.640
Teal'c?

40:45.800 --> 40:47.760
Daniel Jackson will be fine.

40:59.320 --> 41:01.240
I love you, too.
