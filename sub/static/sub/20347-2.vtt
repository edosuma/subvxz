00:28.834 --> 00:31.125
I think every kid grows up

00:31.126 --> 00:32.290
wanting to be a superhero.

00:34.166 --> 00:37.083
You put the towel
around your neck

00:37.084 --> 00:38.166
and you run around
the living room.

00:38.167 --> 00:41.041
I think every kid
wanted to swoop in

00:41.042 --> 00:42.333
and help people
once in a while.

00:44.959 --> 00:46.750
And at least for me,
what's happened is I became

00:46.751 --> 00:49.000
addicted to the idea.

00:53.166 --> 00:56.250
An FBI car came
flying up the sidewalk,

00:56.251 --> 00:58.542
and they all converged
on me at once.

01:00.041 --> 01:04.041
They handcuffed me
and seized my computers.

01:04.042 --> 01:06.041
They had all the evidence
they needed,

01:06.042 --> 01:08.625
but I never harmed a soul.

01:08.626 --> 01:10.041
I've never done anything

01:10.042 --> 01:12.125
besides touch my fingers
to my computer

01:12.126 --> 01:13.333
and seek freedom and justice.

01:15.834 --> 01:18.000
In a perfect world,

01:18.001 --> 01:20.458
heroes protect us
from bad guys.

01:20.459 --> 01:24.208
Laws protect us
from criminals.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.625
But this is not
a perfect world.

01:27.626 --> 01:30.667
Today's crusaders and
vigilantes

01:30.668 --> 01:32.583
hide behind user names,

01:32.584 --> 01:35.375
and search for clues
in the digital trails

01:35.376 --> 01:37.083
we all leave behind.

01:39.917 --> 01:42.083
Who's to judge?

01:48.458 --> 01:53.792
Is there justice?
Can there be justice?

01:53.793 --> 01:55.291
I suppose it's possible

01:55.292 --> 01:58.542
if people stopped letting
their emotions rule.

01:59.834 --> 02:01.542
But people don't know
how to do that.

02:03.125 --> 02:04.625
I don't know, maybe it's
the hunters in us,

02:04.626 --> 02:07.125
smelling the fear
in the prey or something,

02:07.126 --> 02:08.291
looking for blood.

02:11.458 --> 02:12.625
54-year-old Myra

02:12.626 --> 02:16.208
is a mother of five
and a grandmother of six.

02:17.458 --> 02:18.458
She's also kind of a badass.

02:20.291 --> 02:22.083
I am a bouncer
at a night club,

02:22.084 --> 02:26.417
and I also teach self-defense.

02:26.418 --> 02:28.875
I don't like seeing people
being picked on.

02:28.876 --> 02:32.500
I don't like seeing people
being abused.

02:32.501 --> 02:35.333
It really bothers me,
and I'll step in every time.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.083
My father was an investigator

02:40.084 --> 02:43.166
for the Public Defender's
office in Sacramento,

02:43.167 --> 02:45.959
and he'd tell me
his latest stories,

02:45.960 --> 02:48.625
his latest investigations.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.583
My father discovered

02:49.584 --> 02:51.333
that the system
isn't quite as perfect

02:51.334 --> 02:54.166
as people want
to believe it is.

02:54.167 --> 02:56.500
There's a lot of
innocent people in jail,

02:56.501 --> 02:59.583
and probably a lot of guilty
people out of jail, as well.

02:59.584 --> 03:02.708
So his cases
were fascinating to me.

03:02.709 --> 03:05.417
There was that little tickle
in the back of my brain saying,

03:05.418 --> 03:07.333
"I want answers."

03:11.500 --> 03:14.500
Piecing together
the clues, seeking justice.

03:15.542 --> 03:18.542
It's an impulse that's
brought Myra to Websleuths,

03:18.543 --> 03:20.834
the biggest
true-crime forum online.

03:22.500 --> 03:25.667
Here, more than
100,000 active users

03:25.668 --> 03:27.667
become amateur detectives,

03:27.668 --> 03:30.542
sifting through 250,000
plus threads

03:30.543 --> 03:35.333
on cold-case murders
and kidnapped children.

03:35.334 --> 03:38.959
You get sucked in,
and sometimes you find things

03:38.960 --> 03:40.542
that you never
would have imagined.

03:42.542 --> 03:45.333
One day, a story came up,
and it was about

03:45.334 --> 03:50.500
this 20-year-old girl
named Morgan Ingram.

03:50.501 --> 03:52.375
She was young,
she was pretty,

03:52.376 --> 03:55.500
and her parents believed
she was being stalked.

03:57.291 --> 03:59.792
They had wildlife cameras
posted around their house,

03:59.793 --> 04:02.792
and they caught an image
of this person

04:02.793 --> 04:05.083
standing in the driveway.

04:05.084 --> 04:08.166
There were lights tripping,
rocks hitting the window.

04:08.167 --> 04:10.834
At one point, they claimed

04:10.835 --> 04:15.291
that shoeprints were found
underneath the bathroom window.

04:15.292 --> 04:17.875
The stalking supposedly
went on for months,

04:17.875 --> 04:19.208
and the police
tried their hardest

04:19.209 --> 04:21.500
to figure out
what was going on,

04:21.500 --> 04:23.625
but they never
did catch anybody.

04:24.542 --> 04:28.750
And then one morning,
they woke up,

04:28.751 --> 04:30.083
and Morgan had died.

04:31.250 --> 04:33.375
They had found her dead
in her room,

04:33.376 --> 04:35.375
and it just absolutely
breaks your heart.

04:36.625 --> 04:40.458
The people who knew her talked
about how she was funny,

04:40.459 --> 04:43.834
how she was intelligent
and artistic.

04:43.835 --> 04:45.875
Now her art, her pictures,

04:45.876 --> 04:48.959
her friendships, her loves...

04:48.960 --> 04:51.083
gone, wiped out.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.959
Her mother had come
on Websleuths asking for help

04:54.960 --> 04:57.625
in solving this crime,

04:57.626 --> 05:00.583
and a lot of us are moms
on that board.

05:00.584 --> 05:03.750
And we felt like Morgan
could have been our daughter.

05:04.792 --> 05:06.667
So we all dove in.

05:06.668 --> 05:08.625
We were gonna get this guy.

05:10.959 --> 05:13.250
The Internet has unleashed

05:13.251 --> 05:14.792
legions of DIY detectives,

05:14.793 --> 05:17.250
and they're casing
the network for suspects.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.417
Stand accused online,

05:20.418 --> 05:22.750
and it's your innocence
that you have to prove.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.125
There were so many accusations

05:26.126 --> 05:27.917
that I can't even
remember all of them.

05:30.291 --> 05:32.959
Basically that I just had
to pick this girl out,

05:32.960 --> 05:34.208
and that I got some kind
of sick kick

05:34.209 --> 05:35.542
out of ruining her life.

05:38.291 --> 05:40.542
And I don't even know
this girl.

05:42.458 --> 05:46.166
In 2011,
Keenan was 18 years old,

05:46.167 --> 05:48.500
a night-shift manager
at a local grocery store,

05:48.501 --> 05:51.250
when he moved in
with his girlfriend

05:51.251 --> 05:53.375
down the street
from Morgan Ingram

05:53.376 --> 05:55.875
and her parents,
Toni and Steve.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.417
I honestly have no idea
why they picked me out.

06:01.418 --> 06:03.000
I'm assuming it's 'cause
I work nights

06:03.001 --> 06:04.083
and they were seeing a car drive

06:04.084 --> 06:06.500
through the neighborhood
at random times.

06:06.501 --> 06:11.166
The police would pull me over
or just follow me.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.166
A couple times,
cops actually held, like,

06:13.167 --> 06:16.208
interrogations with me.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.000
And that's when they told me,

06:19.001 --> 06:19.875
"There's a case going on
at that house,

06:19.876 --> 06:22.417
and you're one
of our top suspects."

06:25.583 --> 06:28.375
It's like, "What am I going
to have to do to prove

06:28.376 --> 06:30.166
there's no possible way
I could have done this?"

06:32.500 --> 06:35.000
Online, there may
be no escaping judgment.

06:36.583 --> 06:40.834
Sometimes, your only hope
is to try to stay anonymous.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.208
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:47.209 --> 06:48.708
in preparation for landing,

06:48.709 --> 06:50.750
please make sure your seatbelt
is securely fastened.

06:52.875 --> 06:53.834
Once they find out

06:53.835 --> 06:55.708
that this meeting
is taking place,

06:55.709 --> 07:00.417
you will come on the radar
of U.S. law enforcement

07:00.418 --> 07:02.542
and quite possibly
U.S. intelligence.

07:07.166 --> 07:08.667
They will try to find out

07:08.668 --> 07:11.041
where you went by tracing
your electronic footprint.

07:13.417 --> 07:14.708
And so we can't talk
about the details of how

07:14.709 --> 07:18.708
we come to be together
in this motel room,

07:18.709 --> 07:20.583
because that would
be information

07:20.584 --> 07:21.917
that they would use
against us.

07:24.750 --> 07:25.917
Where we're sitting right now,

07:25.918 --> 07:27.750
we're in a foreign country,
you know.

07:27.751 --> 07:28.792
The United States
has no writ here,

07:28.793 --> 07:30.667
and that's just tough shit
for them, isn't it?

07:34.750 --> 07:37.750
In a room
booked under another name,

07:37.751 --> 07:40.208
in a city that can't be
identified,

07:40.209 --> 07:41.625
Commander X is hiding out.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.667
If I'm standing up for you,

07:45.668 --> 07:46.792
then I'm certainly
not scary at all.

07:50.041 --> 07:52.917
If you're the target,
however,

07:52.918 --> 07:54.750
then I guess
I'm a cyber terrorist.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.708
It really is a matter
of perspective.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.708
Greetings,
people of the world.

08:02.709 --> 08:04.750
Allow me to introduce myself
as Anonymous.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.959
X is in league
with Anonymous,

08:06.960 --> 08:11.458
the Internet collective
notorious for cyber anarchy,

08:11.459 --> 08:14.208
for trolling and pranking
the establishment,

08:14.209 --> 08:15.625
and defacing their websites.

08:18.250 --> 08:19.917
But X is another breed
of Anon...

08:19.918 --> 08:24.125
A hacktivist, leaking data
and breaching networks

08:24.126 --> 08:26.291
for a higher purpose.

08:26.292 --> 08:27.333
I've been
a protestor for 35 years,

08:27.334 --> 08:31.250
an activist for 35 years.

08:31.251 --> 08:33.375
When I see tyrants
crushing people

08:33.376 --> 08:36.000
and messing with people
and destroying their lives...

08:36.001 --> 08:39.000
that's a motherfucking problem.

08:39.001 --> 08:43.082
Okay, that's a big problem
for somebody like me.

08:43.083 --> 08:46.458
We always had the power
as hackers

08:46.459 --> 08:48.625
to affect change.

08:48.626 --> 08:51.083
So when I deal
with activists in Egypt

08:51.084 --> 08:53.333
and Tunisia
and Black Lives Matter,

08:53.334 --> 08:57.375
I'm able to bring them
technological expertise.

08:57.376 --> 08:59.625
I can tell them
how to live stream

08:59.626 --> 09:01.750
their protests to the world.

09:01.751 --> 09:04.625
If you ask those people
who they feel safer about...

09:04.626 --> 09:06.083
Their government,

09:06.084 --> 09:09.542
their police or us,
those people will tell you,

09:09.543 --> 09:11.375
this is what makes
them feel safe.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.917
This is what makes them
feel empowered.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.875
X's intentions might be noble,

09:16.876 --> 09:18.875
but going after governments
and corporations

09:18.876 --> 09:22.041
online can bring down
real-world consequences.

09:22.042 --> 09:24.834
There's a major takedown in
the war against computer crime.

09:24.835 --> 09:25.750
Authorities in the United States
and Europe

09:25.751 --> 09:28.708
just rounded up
some alleged hackers.

09:28.709 --> 09:32.000
14 people across
the country now under arrest,

09:32.001 --> 09:34.125
accused of being members
of a hacking group

09:34.126 --> 09:35.542
called Anonymous.

09:35.543 --> 09:36.583
These arrests should
send a clear message,

09:36.584 --> 09:39.792
that we're not playing
around anymore.

09:39.793 --> 09:42.708
When a hacker's in trouble,

09:42.709 --> 09:44.291
who helps him make his case?

09:50.542 --> 09:52.250
There was
a rebel streak in my soul

09:52.251 --> 09:54.208
from day one.

09:54.209 --> 09:57.917
I saw the Grateful Dead
164 times.

09:57.918 --> 09:59.917
Not only did I always want
to be a lawyer,

09:59.918 --> 10:02.792
but I always wanted to be
a criminal defense lawyer.

10:02.793 --> 10:05.750
That's the essence, to me,

10:05.751 --> 10:08.375
of freedom of liberty...

10:08.376 --> 10:12.041
Making sure that the state
doesn't crush the individual.

10:13.375 --> 10:16.583
Attorneys are
supposed to defend the law.

10:16.584 --> 10:18.959
Jay Leiderman wants
to give it an upgrade.

10:23.917 --> 10:26.875
My private
practice started in 2006.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.959
You know, good old
garden-variety drugs,

10:31.960 --> 10:35.625
theft, violence,
what have you.

10:38.041 --> 10:42.166
When I first learned about
hacktivism, it spoke to me.

10:42.167 --> 10:45.583
These guys are protesting
state-sponsored censorship,

10:45.584 --> 10:47.208
government oppression.

10:47.209 --> 10:49.166
Things that I care about.

10:49.167 --> 10:52.625
The least I can do
is give them some backing.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.750
Jay is known
as "the hacker's attorney."

10:57.500 --> 11:00.125
In his office and on his phone,

11:00.126 --> 11:02.792
he keeps an encrypted
chat line open,

11:02.793 --> 11:05.834
dispensing pro bono legal
advice to hackers in need.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.708
A lot of times, I don't know
who I'm talking to.

11:10.709 --> 11:11.959
I don't know where they are.

11:11.960 --> 11:15.625
All of a sudden,
someone direct messages me.

11:15.626 --> 11:16.917
And they were like, "Hey.

11:16.918 --> 11:19.417
I've just hacked
the whole country of Sweden.

11:19.418 --> 11:23.125
What do I do?"

11:23.126 --> 11:26.959
You can make the argument
that taking websites offline

11:26.960 --> 11:29.041
for weeks on end,

11:29.042 --> 11:33.291
or leaving a website
a smoking crater in cyberspace

11:33.292 --> 11:35.000
that's evil hacking.

11:35.001 --> 11:36.667
But, you know,
a lot of the time,

11:36.668 --> 11:39.458
small-scale defaces of websites,

11:39.459 --> 11:41.291
blocking web traffic

11:41.292 --> 11:45.667
those should be considered
a legitimate form of protest,

11:45.668 --> 11:48.667
and a legitimate form
of free speech.

11:48.668 --> 11:51.792
But if you're the government,
it just doesn't work that way.

12:01.542 --> 12:04.125
I thought I'd just
have a normal life for life.

12:06.166 --> 12:09.625
Working all the time,
getting a family.

12:09.626 --> 12:11.625
Doing the same thing
everybody else does.

12:12.917 --> 12:15.708
I've had some run-in
with law enforcement...

12:15.709 --> 12:19.875
A marijuana charge
when I was younger.

12:19.876 --> 12:23.125
Speeding tickets,
couple of those.

12:23.126 --> 12:24.917
And that's pretty much it.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.166
That changed
in August of 2011,

12:28.167 --> 12:32.000
when Keenan was accused
of stalking Morgan Ingram

12:32.001 --> 12:35.792
three months before
she was found dead.

12:35.793 --> 12:38.250
The police scrutinized
his every move,

12:38.251 --> 12:40.708
but the data was
on Keenan's side.

12:42.458 --> 12:43.583
At the grocery store,

12:43.584 --> 12:44.708
we had
the fingerprint scanner...

12:44.709 --> 12:46.250
Your own private number
you had to punch in,

12:46.251 --> 12:47.792
with fingerprint recognition.

12:47.793 --> 12:50.208
Otherwise, it wouldn't
let you clock in.

12:50.209 --> 12:54.375
The store has 54 cameras,
good cameras.

12:54.376 --> 12:56.917
And the Ingrams would
call the cops and say,

12:56.918 --> 12:58.917
"He's outside my house,"
or whatever,

12:58.918 --> 13:02.583
while they had me on video
stocking the shelves.

13:02.584 --> 13:03.750
The night that Morgan died,
that's one of the nights

13:03.751 --> 13:06.208
that the police
really looked into,

13:06.209 --> 13:07.708
at the cameras
and all that stuff.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.583
And they... they realized

13:09.584 --> 13:14.458
that I wasn't behind any of it.

13:17.041 --> 13:20.208
The coroner ruled
Morgan's death a suicide

13:20.209 --> 13:22.834
by overdose of
the painkiller amitriptyline,

13:22.835 --> 13:25.125
and the police
closed the case.

13:25.126 --> 13:30.333
But online, the trial
was just getting started.

13:30.334 --> 13:31.250
Toni Ingram believed

13:31.251 --> 13:32.959
that her daughter
had been murdered.

13:32.960 --> 13:37.500
So she started this blog,
almost like a diary,

13:37.501 --> 13:40.959
day by day
following the stalking

13:40.960 --> 13:42.917
and the eventual death
of her daughter.

13:42.918 --> 13:46.959
It was a major hit.
It almost went viral.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.083
And as Toni's
producing this blog,

13:49.084 --> 13:50.875
her beliefs about
what happened started

13:50.876 --> 13:54.291
getting more
and more outlandish.

13:54.292 --> 13:57.834
Whoever had killed Morgan,
according to Toni,

13:57.835 --> 13:59.250
broke into the house,

13:59.251 --> 14:02.750
made her drink
liquid amitriptyline,

14:02.751 --> 14:06.667
waited several hours
for it to kill her,

14:06.668 --> 14:10.583
at some point raped her,
redressed her,

14:10.584 --> 14:12.125
and then crept
out of the house.

14:14.417 --> 14:17.667
I realized that
Toni was grieving

14:17.668 --> 14:20.125
and that this was her way
of grieving,

14:20.126 --> 14:21.917
that she had to tell her story.

14:21.918 --> 14:24.333
But when she started
naming Keenan,

14:24.334 --> 14:27.667
saying he was responsible
for the murder of her daughter,

14:27.668 --> 14:30.583
we're like, ""

14:30.584 --> 14:32.500
I mean, freedom of speech
does not allow you

14:32.501 --> 14:35.667
to blame people for something
that they didn't do.

14:37.542 --> 14:38.667
Online,

14:38.668 --> 14:41.166
anyone can play judge,
jury, and executioner.

14:42.208 --> 14:45.000
But isn't that what we love
about the Internet,

14:45.001 --> 14:48.542
that everyone can
speak their mind?

14:48.543 --> 14:50.500
After all,

14:50.501 --> 14:53.208
it's a free country... right?

14:53.209 --> 14:56.041
One of the issues
for people who call me

14:56.042 --> 14:59.875
is that the penalties
for computer crimes

14:59.876 --> 15:01.000
are so out of whack

15:01.001 --> 15:06.625
with penalties
for regular crimes.

15:06.626 --> 15:08.792
And that involves
congress itself.

15:08.793 --> 15:11.500
Your average congressperson

15:11.501 --> 15:14.083
is like a 60-, 70-,

15:14.084 --> 15:16.542
110-year-old white man,

15:16.543 --> 15:20.500
and they are scared
to death of hackers

15:20.501 --> 15:21.625
because they don't understand.

15:21.626 --> 15:23.708
And what we don't
understand, we fear.

15:25.333 --> 15:26.959
Faced with a threat,

15:26.960 --> 15:28.417
the government passes a law...

15:28.418 --> 15:32.542
The Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act, or CFAA,

15:32.543 --> 15:34.750
prohibiting unauthorized access

15:34.751 --> 15:37.750
to a computer or server.

15:37.751 --> 15:39.917
The law tries to go after

15:39.918 --> 15:43.041
people who are hacking things
involving national security,

15:43.042 --> 15:45.083
banks, things like that,

15:45.084 --> 15:46.166
but as the years roll by,

15:46.167 --> 15:49.625
the courts have
expanded the definitions

15:49.626 --> 15:51.208
to the point where

15:51.209 --> 15:54.917
anything now constitutes
unauthorized access.

15:54.918 --> 15:57.500
This is
a peaceful protest!

15:57.501 --> 15:58.959
Think of this analogy...

15:58.960 --> 16:01.625
Let's say 60 people
go into Bank of America

16:01.626 --> 16:03.792
and just sit down.

16:03.793 --> 16:05.375
What are they going to get,

16:05.376 --> 16:09.208
$250 fine, 5 days in jail?

16:09.209 --> 16:11.291
If you do a DDoS,

16:11.292 --> 16:16.417
which is a digital sit-in,
it's a federal crime.

16:16.418 --> 16:18.000
It's a federal felony.

16:18.001 --> 16:20.834
It's a, you know,
it's a big deal.

16:20.835 --> 16:24.375
DDoS...
Distributed Denial of Service.

16:24.376 --> 16:27.917
A group gathers online,
and in a coordinated strike,

16:27.918 --> 16:30.625
sends data packets
to a specific website,

16:30.626 --> 16:32.333
temporarily crashing it

16:32.334 --> 16:35.041
with an overload
of information.

16:35.042 --> 16:37.166
A series of cyber attacks

16:37.167 --> 16:40.708
made dozens of popular websites
inaccessible today.

16:40.709 --> 16:41.667
Tens of millions

16:41.668 --> 16:42.708
couldn't check
their banking accounts

16:42.709 --> 16:45.333
or log on to local news.

16:46.959 --> 16:50.500
Recently,
hackers made headlines

16:50.501 --> 16:52.667
by cutting off access
to Twitter,

16:52.668 --> 16:55.458
Amazon, Reddit, Spotify,

16:55.459 --> 16:58.166
and banking sites.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.667
But six years ago,

16:59.668 --> 17:03.166
Commander X and over
200 fellow hacktivists

17:03.167 --> 17:06.250
repurposed DDoS for protests.

17:06.251 --> 17:08.333
Their target
was the main page

17:08.334 --> 17:11.583
of the Santa Cruz
county government.

17:11.584 --> 17:12.875
Santa Cruz county

17:12.876 --> 17:16.834
has a history
of militant gentrification

17:16.835 --> 17:19.000
to rid themselves
of homeless people.

17:19.001 --> 17:20.290
It's actually against the law

17:20.291 --> 17:23.458
to sit on a park bench
for more than one hour,

17:23.459 --> 17:25.416
and you can't cover yourself
with a blanket

17:25.417 --> 17:29.250
during certain hours of
the night anywhere in public.

17:29.251 --> 17:32.917
And so, that was
the motivation of the attack.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.875
We met in the chat room,

17:35.876 --> 17:40.041
and each of us pulled out
whatever choice of DDoS weapon.

17:40.042 --> 17:43.667
And at exactly noon, we fired,
and the site crashed.

17:45.708 --> 17:48.208
At the 30-minute mark,
I asked everybody to stop.

17:48.209 --> 17:51.583
It took less than
2 minutes for the website

17:51.584 --> 17:55.125
to return to normal function,
and that was it.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.375
No servers were breached,
no data was stolen.

17:58.376 --> 18:02.417
It's a small, crowdsourced act
of civil disobedience.

18:03.375 --> 18:06.583
So none of us took
any kind of precautions

18:06.584 --> 18:10.417
to hide our traffic,
to encrypt our chats.

18:10.418 --> 18:14.125
We were honestly as naive
as you could possibly get.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.834
Nine months later,
X was cornered

18:17.835 --> 18:20.166
by FBI agents
outside a coffee shop.

18:20.959 --> 18:22.708
He and another hacktivist

18:22.709 --> 18:25.250
were the only ones
arrested in the DDoS.

18:25.251 --> 18:28.417
The indictment
listed X's charges...

18:28.418 --> 18:32.583
Conspiracy and unauthorized
access of a computer.

18:32.584 --> 18:34.291
Because of the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,

18:34.292 --> 18:38.583
X would be facing
a total of 15 years,

18:38.584 --> 18:40.125
plus, just for good measure,

18:40.126 --> 18:42.375
a $500,000 fine
on top of that.

18:44.792 --> 18:46.250
Sounds reasonable, right?

18:46.251 --> 18:50.458
It's unjust to take
that many years

18:50.459 --> 18:53.583
of my life
away from me for protest.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.792
I was out on federal bail,

18:57.793 --> 18:59.583
and I had to think very quickly.

19:01.333 --> 19:04.208
I hiked up into
the Santa Cruz mountains.

19:04.209 --> 19:08.125
After that, it was a series of
safe houses and transportation.

19:08.126 --> 19:10.542
I crossed over from Washington
state into British Columbia,

19:10.543 --> 19:13.208
and then I was in Canada.

19:13.209 --> 19:15.959
So from my perspective,
I'm a political exile.

19:17.792 --> 19:20.959
But according to the U.S.
Department of Justice,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.125
I'm a fugitive.

19:25.166 --> 19:27.625
It makes you feel like

19:27.626 --> 19:29.500
there's two different kinds
of justice.

19:30.500 --> 19:35.000
There's the cops and the courts
that closed the case,

19:35.001 --> 19:37.959
but then on the Internet,
the facts don't always matter.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.500
When the story started
spreading online,

19:41.501 --> 19:43.834
I started getting
hundreds of messages

19:43.835 --> 19:46.625
through Facebook,
like, per day.

19:46.626 --> 19:50.500
From Canada, Europe,
Africa, South America.

19:52.083 --> 19:55.291
Just from people
telling me their opinion.

19:55.292 --> 19:57.417
They started coming in worse
and worse and worse.

19:59.834 --> 20:02.500
Makes you feel helpless,
feel bad about yourself.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.291
The worst part
was hurting my family.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.792
When I read
some of the things, I said,

20:11.793 --> 20:14.208
"This isn't my son.
This isn't him.

20:14.209 --> 20:15.875
This isn't the kind
of person he is."

20:17.041 --> 20:19.792
And I did try to make
some comments to that effect,

20:19.793 --> 20:21.291
to help him.

20:21.292 --> 20:25.291
But on Toni's blog
or website,

20:25.292 --> 20:27.166
all comments are filtered.

20:27.167 --> 20:30.750
So if she doesn't like it,
it never shows up.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.250
It's just gone.

20:32.251 --> 20:35.417
And it's not just one website
accusing him, there's many.

20:35.418 --> 20:38.917
The one blog rapidly
escalated into multiple blogs.

20:38.918 --> 20:40.291
They seem to just pop up.

20:40.292 --> 20:42.625
We don't even know
who's behind them.

20:44.583 --> 20:47.125
We talked to law
enforcement and lawyers,

20:47.126 --> 20:49.417
even FBI, stuff like that.

20:49.418 --> 20:51.375
And without tens
of thousands of dollars,

20:51.376 --> 20:53.083
there's nothing you can do.

20:53.084 --> 20:54.542
People can say
whatever they want.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.917
I'll have
the mushroom Swiss burger.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.291
-All right.
-Thank you.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.917
As a parent,
you're wondering, worrying.

21:06.918 --> 21:08.083
You know, what's in his mind?

21:08.084 --> 21:10.250
How is he handling this?
Because you don't know...

21:10.251 --> 21:13.458
You want to fix it.
And you can't.

21:13.459 --> 21:16.041
That's the frustration.
There's just nothing...

21:16.042 --> 21:18.250
There's nothing you can do.

21:23.417 --> 21:26.583
There was nights
that I would cry,

21:26.584 --> 21:30.125
just not knowing
what to do at all, ever.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.667
Giving up has crossed my mind.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.166
Just dying, going away.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.291
Didn't really seem like
such a bad option.

21:44.625 --> 21:47.000
To be hounded
by anonymous accusers

21:47.001 --> 21:49.208
brandishing digital pitchforks,

21:49.209 --> 21:53.875
exposing your name,
your face, your family...

21:53.876 --> 21:55.834
it's happened before.

21:59.125 --> 22:03.708
April 2013, three days after
the Boston Marathon bombing,

22:03.709 --> 22:07.000
the FBI released surveillance
footage from the scene,

22:07.001 --> 22:09.000
inspiring millions of users
on Reddit

22:09.001 --> 22:11.959
and Twitter to launch
a crowdsourced manhunt.

22:13.125 --> 22:16.625
One user I.D.'d the perpetrator
as former classmate

22:16.626 --> 22:19.083
Sunil Tripathi,
who'd gone missing

22:19.084 --> 22:20.166
in Rhode Island
a month earlier.

22:20.167 --> 22:23.875
And the hunch set off a frenzy.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.875
Sleuths harassed and
threatened Sunil's family,

22:26.876 --> 22:27.750
until it was discovered

22:27.751 --> 22:30.291
that Sunil had
committed suicide

22:30.292 --> 22:32.500
before the bombing had
even taken place.

22:35.792 --> 22:39.250
I think online,
people become so detached

22:39.251 --> 22:42.417
from the realities of the lives
that they're touching

22:42.418 --> 22:45.500
that they don't... it's like
a TV show, maybe, to them?

22:45.501 --> 22:47.542
So, let's say Keenan decided
to go to college,

22:47.543 --> 22:51.375
or maybe he met a woman
that he really loved.

22:51.376 --> 22:54.834
And people do background
searches now.

22:54.835 --> 22:56.834
I mean, what was going
to pop up?

22:56.835 --> 22:59.375
He's a rapist, he's a murderer.

22:59.376 --> 23:02.792
We knew that this man's life
was basically gonna be ruined

23:02.793 --> 23:04.500
if we didn't do anything.

23:04.501 --> 23:07.208
So a group of us left Websleuths

23:07.209 --> 23:08.834
and started our own board

23:08.835 --> 23:11.834
where we could discuss
Morgan's death in private.

23:11.835 --> 23:14.250
We got ahold
of the police reports,

23:14.251 --> 23:16.750
the toxicology screens,
the forensics, everything.

23:17.792 --> 23:22.208
There were pill fragments found
in the stomach contents,

23:22.209 --> 23:24.041
and there were large amounts.

23:24.042 --> 23:25.333
There was no struggle,

23:25.334 --> 23:26.542
there were no bruises
that indicated

23:26.543 --> 23:29.375
that somebody
was holding her down.

23:29.376 --> 23:32.542
It was very clear
that she wasn't raped,

23:32.543 --> 23:35.417
and there was no evidence
that she was killed.

23:35.418 --> 23:37.166
It was clearly suicide.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.708
Myra and her team of sleuths

23:40.709 --> 23:41.959
took their investigation live

23:41.960 --> 23:43.583
with a blog called
Truth for Morgan.

23:45.375 --> 23:47.041
With every new hit,

23:47.042 --> 23:49.166
the page moves closer
and closer to the top

23:49.167 --> 23:52.417
of the search results
for Keenan's name,

23:52.418 --> 23:56.291
displacing the rumors
with cold, hard facts.

23:56.292 --> 23:59.458
We weren't trying to say
that Toni was a bad person.

23:59.459 --> 24:02.041
We weren't trying
to smear Morgan's name.

24:02.042 --> 24:04.542
We just wanted to make sure
that everybody

24:04.543 --> 24:07.750
who was gonna form
an opinion about this,

24:07.751 --> 24:10.834
and especially about Keenan,
had all the facts.

24:12.041 --> 24:15.375
People said, you know,
"How can you protect a killer?"

24:16.625 --> 24:18.083
I'm not protecting a killer.

24:18.084 --> 24:19.834
I'm protecting an innocent man.

24:23.208 --> 24:24.458
I've never harmed a soul.

24:24.459 --> 24:28.792
I mean, who was hurt
by what I did?

24:28.793 --> 24:29.667
I'll never see my family again,

24:29.668 --> 24:32.125
I'll never see
my friends again.

24:32.126 --> 24:34.375
I'll never return
to my home country again.

24:34.376 --> 24:36.917
This is a one-way trip.

24:39.375 --> 24:41.000
Five years into his exile,

24:41.001 --> 24:43.291
Commander X is 52 and homeless,

24:43.292 --> 24:45.875
panhandling to pay for food.

24:47.208 --> 24:50.333
His DDoS against Santa Cruz
didn't change the law,

24:50.334 --> 24:52.125
but he's still fighting,

24:52.126 --> 24:56.458
helping launch hacktivist ops
in Ferguson, South America,

24:56.459 --> 24:58.417
and the Middle East.

24:58.418 --> 25:02.000
I don't like fuckin' bullies,
and I don't think I ever will.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.333
I'm taking advantage
of every moment of liberty

25:03.334 --> 25:05.667
that I stole from them,

25:05.668 --> 25:07.959
to try to do what I set out
to do in the first place,

25:07.960 --> 25:09.542
which is bring change
to the world.

25:11.166 --> 25:14.708
Any time we chat,
Commander X and myself,

25:14.709 --> 25:15.875
I have to explain to him...

25:15.876 --> 25:19.625
Listen, you have to return
to the jurisdiction,

25:19.626 --> 25:22.208
and you have to face
these charges.

25:22.209 --> 25:24.959
To which his reply is,

25:24.960 --> 25:26.708
"Yeah, lawyer boy,
you do my time."

25:28.959 --> 25:31.625
Even if you don't know who he is
or what he does

25:31.626 --> 25:35.166
or even agree
with him as a person,

25:35.167 --> 25:39.166
Commander X is trying
to make your life better.

25:40.333 --> 25:43.750
When one person fights
for personal freedom

25:43.751 --> 25:46.166
against government oppression,

25:46.167 --> 25:47.417
that benefits us all.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.375
The irony is
that we started off

25:51.376 --> 25:54.708
looking for justice for Morgan,

25:54.709 --> 25:58.250
and found injustice instead.

25:58.251 --> 26:01.041
Our mission was just
to lay out the facts,

26:01.042 --> 26:05.166
and to hopefully help clear
this boy's name.

26:06.291 --> 26:07.667
I've never spoken to Keenan,

26:07.668 --> 26:11.125
but I hope we succeeded
in what we attempted to do.

26:13.417 --> 26:15.375
Having somebody on the outside

26:15.376 --> 26:17.291
that doesn't know you

26:17.292 --> 26:20.625
standing up for you
really helped me feel

26:20.626 --> 26:21.875
that not everybody
in the world hates you.

26:25.667 --> 26:29.208
In the real world,
the exonerated might walk free,

26:29.209 --> 26:32.458
but online, old links die hard.

26:32.459 --> 26:35.625
You're sentenced to your
search results for life.

26:36.625 --> 26:38.500
I've thought about
moving away quite a few times,

26:38.501 --> 26:41.875
to a different state where there
won't be anybody that knows me.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.500
But really, you can't run away.

26:45.501 --> 26:47.542
They still have
Internet in Oregon.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.583
It matters to me
what people think about me.

26:54.667 --> 26:58.708
I want people to know
that I'm not some monster.

27:00.667 --> 27:02.125
Good cast.

27:02.126 --> 27:05.750
But it is a free world, you can
believe whatever you want.
