HURRY IT UP.

EASY.

00:25.634 --> 00:26.896
COME ON.

00:59.407 --> 01:02.932
YOU LASTED 3 PATHETIC DAYS
BEHIND BARS

01:02.975 --> 01:06.153
BEFORE YOU BROKE
AND TRIED TO BRING ME DOWN.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.068
I SWEAR I DIDN'T
SELL YOU OUT.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.852
IF YOU'D TAKEN A FALL
AS I ASKED,

01:09.895 --> 01:12.942
DID YOU REALLY THINK
I WAS GONNA LET YOU
ROT IN PRISON?

01:12.985 --> 01:17.164
I NEEDED YOU TO BE
MY MICHELIN STAR CHEF.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.821
EVER SINCE OCEAN'S
DISAPPEARANCE,

01:22.865 --> 01:26.042
WE'VE HAD ISSUES
WITH QUALITY CONTROL.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.175
HE ALWAYS SAID
THE SNAKEBITE FORMULA

01:28.218 --> 01:33.049
WAS TOXIC IF IT
WASN'T COOKED USING
HIS "SECRET METHOD."

01:33.093 --> 01:36.226
AAH! AAH! OHH, OHH!

01:38.576 --> 01:40.143
I CAN HELP YOU.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.102

01:42.145 --> 01:44.016
AAH! HSS!

01:44.060 --> 01:45.757
OHH! OHH!

01:45.801 --> 01:48.804
WELL, THE FINAL
INGREDIENT WILL BE
DELIVERED SOON,

01:48.847 --> 01:51.154
AND IF I'VE
GONE THROUGH
ALL THIS TROUBLE

01:51.198 --> 01:55.637
JUST TO FIND OUT
YOU CAN'T COOK
AFTER ALL, WELL...

01:55.680 --> 02:00.163
AT LEAST I HAVE
WHAT I NEED TO
DISSOLVE YOUR BODY.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.905
UNH! AAH! AAH!

02:16.788 --> 02:18.529
HEY.
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH,

02:18.573 --> 02:20.183
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS
I THINK SHE'S ALIVE.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.446
-YOU DIDN'T FIND A BODY?
-IT WAS AN AMBUSH.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.318
WE FOUND THE BODIES
OF THE AGENTS
TRANSPORTING HER,

02:24.361 --> 02:25.928
BUT ANGELIQUE WAS GONE.

02:25.971 --> 02:28.452
OK, OK. SO
FALSE FACE GOT HER.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.193
WELL, WHERE DID
IT HAPPEN?

02:30.237 --> 02:31.629
DESCRIPTIONS, PLATES!

02:31.673 --> 02:33.196
RYAN, LEAVE THIS ALONE.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.503
FALSE FACE IS DROPPING
BODIES ALL OVER GOTHAM.

02:35.546 --> 02:37.635
WILL YOU LET ME
HELP YOU?

02:37.679 --> 02:40.551
HOW? HOW CAN YOU
HELP US?

02:45.252 --> 02:47.428
I KNOW ANGELIQUE
THE BEST.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.386
STAND DOWN AND LET ME
DO MY JOB.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.388
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I HAVE NEWS.

02:55.392 --> 02:58.526
CROWPHIE SAYS ANG WAS
KIDNAPPED BY FALSE FACE.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.354
DAMN IT. IF ANG HAD
JUST LET ME HELP HER.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.747
ANG SAID FALSE FACE
WANTED HER TO COOK
SNAKEBITE, YEAH?

03:02.791 --> 03:04.445
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S WHY SHE TRIED
TO GET OUT.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.316
SHE DIDN'T WANT
THAT LIFE.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.578
WELL, THEY STILL
WANT IT FOR HER.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.145
EYEWITNESSES REPORTED
THAT TWO CARS

03:09.189 --> 03:10.799
AMBUSHED THE SUV THAT
ANG WAS INSIDE.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.583
A COUPLE HOURS LATER,
THOSE SAME CARS

03:12.627 --> 03:14.846
WERE INVOLVED IN A HEIST
AT GOTHAM PHARMACEUTICAL.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.587
THEY'RE STOCKING UP
ON SUPPLIES.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.244
DO THEY NEED
ANYTHING ELSE?

03:21.288 --> 03:23.246
THE ONE INGREDIENT
THAT WOULDN'T BE
AT THAT WAREHOUSE

03:23.290 --> 03:24.247
IS FEAR TOXIN.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.596
SO THEY'LL HIT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.250
CAN YOU PUT A TRACE
ON THOSE CARS?

03:27.294 --> 03:29.165
WELL, I FLAGGED THEM
BOTH IN THE CITY GRID,

03:29.209 --> 03:30.819
SO AS SOON AS EITHER ONE
MAKES AN APPEARANCE
ON TRAFFIC CAMS,

03:30.862 --> 03:32.690
-YOU'RE UP, BATWOMAN.
-GOOD. I'LL BE READY.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.301
YOU GONNA LOOP IN
SOPHIE?

03:34.344 --> 03:37.042
SO ANG CAN SLIP
THROUGH HER FINGERS AGAIN?

03:39.393 --> 03:41.221
NOT A CHANCE.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.711
DR. RHYME?

03:56.410 --> 03:57.802

OF THINGS.

03:57.846 --> 04:00.544
I'M JACKSON,
YOUR NEW PATIENT. YEAH.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.982
AHH. YES. MY 5:30.

04:21.652 --> 04:25.134
I CAN READ
BETWEEN THE LINES,
YOU SICK PUPPY.

04:28.355 --> 04:31.358
WHO HURT YOU?

04:31.401 --> 04:34.404
I'M SO SORRY
I'M RUNNING LATE.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.233
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

04:40.976 --> 04:46.024
MMM. LOST CAUSE.
I SAVED YOU THE HEADACHE...

04:46.068 --> 04:47.722
ENIGMA.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.553
YOU WERE WORKING
WITH JULIA PENNYWORTH.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.337
AND I APPRECIATE YOU
SENDING HER

04:54.381 --> 04:56.644
ON A LONG VACATION

04:56.687 --> 05:00.604
BECAUSE I NEED SOME
ALONE TIME WITH YOU.

THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.051
FROM WHAT I RECALL,
YOU WERE IN LOVE,

05:13.095 --> 05:15.184
I MADE YOU FORGET
YOUR FEELINGS

05:15.227 --> 05:18.970
AND CONSEQUENTLY
HELPED TURN YOU INTO...

05:19.014 --> 05:20.320
YOU.

05:22.017 --> 05:26.413
KEEP THEM. I DON'T
NEED THE HASSLE.

05:26.456 --> 05:29.590
THEN WHY DID YOU
TRACK ME DOWN?

05:29.633 --> 05:32.244
I HAVE SOMEONE ELSE
I NEED TO FORGET.

TO BRING ANOTHER AGENT
UP TO SPEED, SIR.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.593

ACTUALLY ABOUT?

RYAN, I DON'T WANT TO
FREAK YOU OUT,

12:43.893 --> 12:46.417
BUT THE NEW GUY
WHO'S TAKEN THE LEAD,

12:46.461 --> 12:52.032
HE IS GOING TO SCORCH
THE EARTH TO TAKE
DOWN FALSE FACE,

12:52.075 --> 12:55.035

12:55.078 --> 12:58.255
OK. DOES THIS GUY KNOW
WHERE ANGELIQUE IS?

12:58.299 --> 12:59.779
IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.956
OK. WELL, WE NEED
TO FIND HER FIRST.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.610
WHAT I NEED IS
AN UNDERCOVER ASSET

13:05.654 --> 13:09.440
WHO CAN DRIVE A CAR
LIKE SHE JUST QUALIFIED
FOR THE INDY 500.

13:09.484 --> 13:10.746
WHY IS THAT?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.357
FALSE FACE IS PLANNING
ANOTHER FEAR TOXIN HEIST

13:13.401 --> 13:15.795
JUST AS SOON AS HE FINDS
A NEW DRIVER.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.844
OH, NO. HA HA! NO WAY.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.151
COME ON. I AM GOOD.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.500
I CAN PROVE IT
TO YOU.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.458
GIRL, IT IS
WAY TOO DANGEROUS.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.547
OK. SO IS SITTING
HERE FEELING SORRY
FOR OURSELVES

13:29.591 --> 13:32.028
WHEN A HOMICIDAL
DRUG LORD IS USING

13:32.072 --> 13:34.335
MY EX TO COOK
HIS DOPE.

13:36.728 --> 13:41.342
LOOK. YOU AND I GOT
ANG INTO THIS MESS.

13:41.385 --> 13:45.781
WE NEED TO FIND HER
BEFORE YOUR CROWS DO.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.044
WHAT OTHER OPTIONS
HAVE YOU GOT?

14:03.625 --> 14:05.583
TAKE A DEEP
BREATH, ALICE.

14:17.552 --> 14:20.642
WHAT IS THAT?

14:20.685 --> 14:23.079
WHAT DO YOU FEEL?

14:23.123 --> 14:25.821
DON'T BE A SMARTASS.
JUST ANSWER QUICKLY.

14:31.131 --> 14:33.046
A WARM HAND.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.050
GOOD.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.022
GO FIGURE.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.937
SO YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE?

14:56.373 --> 14:58.810
TURNS OUT YOU'RE
A PARADOX.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.552
YOU GAVE ME THE IDEA
TO ERASE KATE IN MY MIND--

15:01.596 --> 15:04.991
KUDOS FOR THAT--
BUT YOU ALSO HAPPEN TO BE KATE,

15:05.034 --> 15:07.689
SO, UH, THERE'S THE DOOR.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.958
WHAT AM I MISSING?

15:16.002 --> 15:17.612
STOP THAT.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.657
MAKE ME!

15:19.701 --> 15:23.357
YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU KNEW ME BETTER
THAN I KNEW MYSELF.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.968
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
SO SCARED OF ME.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.057
I CAN SEE YOU HAVE
SO MUCH LOVE TO GIVE.

15:28.101 --> 15:33.802
YOU WOULD SEE IT, TOO,
IF YOU JUST LOOK
AT YOURSELF.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.543
YOU CONDESCENDING,
LITTLE KNOW-IT-ALL.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.980
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO I REALLY AM?

15:38.024 --> 15:40.591
A MANIPULATOR.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.376
I WANTED YOU TO THINK
I LOVED YOU

15:42.419 --> 15:45.118
AS MUCH AS YOU LOVED ME
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SISTERS DO,

15:45.161 --> 15:47.990
BUT I FELT NOTHING
FOR YOU!

15:49.818 --> 15:52.081
FOR ANYONE.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.604
YOU'RE NOT
REMEMBERING RIGHT.

15:53.648 --> 15:56.172
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
THE TRUTH.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.131
I WAS BORN
WITH THIS BAD BRAIN,

15:58.174 --> 16:02.831
AND IT IS ONLY CAPABLE
OF HATE AND JEALOUSY
AND BITTERNESS.

16:02.874 --> 16:04.311
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

16:06.443 --> 16:11.231
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
SO MANY BULLETS TO SAVE ME.

16:11.274 --> 16:14.756
BETH...I'M
YOUR SISTER,

16:14.799 --> 16:18.499
AND I'LL ALWAYS
BELIEVE IN YOU.

16:18.542 --> 16:22.764
THANKS, SIS.
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.986
EXCEPT IT DOESN'T
BECAUSE YOU'RE DEAD.

16:30.641 --> 16:34.732
A MASTER MANIPULATOR
WITH NO FEELINGS.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.256
GIVE ME A BREAK.

16:36.299 --> 16:39.607
ISN'T SHE
SO SILLY?

16:39.650 --> 16:44.003
NO, NO, NO.
I JUST GOT RID OF YOU!

16:56.841 --> 16:58.974
DOCTOR...

17:02.151 --> 17:05.981
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
YOU'RE TOYING WITH ME.

17:10.899 --> 17:14.163
OOH! WHOO! NICE!

17:14.207 --> 17:16.339
OK, OK. LET ME SEE.

17:16.383 --> 17:19.038
MARY WAS SWEET
ENOUGH TO LEND US
HER CAR,

17:19.081 --> 17:21.301
BUT IF THERE IS
SO MUCH AS A BUG
ON THE WINDSHIELD

17:21.344 --> 17:22.954
AFTER THIS, SHE MADE
IT CLEAR

17:22.998 --> 17:25.261
WE'LL BOTH END UP
IN THE TRUNK.

17:25.305 --> 17:29.700
LOOK AT ALL THESE...
CYLINDERS.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.051
CAN I TAKE IT
FOR A SPIN?

17:32.094 --> 17:35.054
I GOT SOME INFO
FROM THE LAST DRIVER
ON HOW HE WAS HIRED.

17:35.097 --> 17:38.144
YOU'LL HAVE TO RUN
THROUGH A SERIES
OF STREET RACING MOVES.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.581
NO WAY OF KNOWING
WHAT THEY'LL BE.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.887
-PIECE OF CAKE.
-THEY'RE GONNA INTERVIEW YOU.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.325
YOU'LL HAVE TO
KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THIS CAR

17:45.368 --> 17:46.239
AND HOW TO MANEUVER IT.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.067
OK, OK. WELL, UH...

17:49.633 --> 17:52.767
WE GOT THE GAS PEDAL.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.769
I'M KIDDING, OK?

17:54.812 --> 17:57.163
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
RED-LINING IS,

17:57.206 --> 17:58.642
WHAT BACKPEDALING MEANS,

17:58.686 --> 18:02.124
HOW TO MEASURE YOUR CAMBER
AND AIRFLOW?

18:02.168 --> 18:03.952
ARE YOU HELPING ME,

18:03.995 --> 18:06.389
OR ARE YOU JUST
LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE
TO CALL THIS OFF?

18:12.308 --> 18:15.355
I JUST WANT THIS TO WORK.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.314
WE ARE GOING TO GET
ANG BACK, OK?

18:18.358 --> 18:20.316
I'LL DO MY PART.
I'LL STUDY.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.927
WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER THEY HIRE ME?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.281
YOU'LL WAIT
FOR THE COORDINATES
OF THE PICKUP,

18:28.324 --> 18:30.370
THEY'LL PUT THE PAYLOAD
IN YOUR CAR,

18:30.413 --> 18:32.067
AND ON YOUR WAY
TO THE DROP-OFF,

18:32.111 --> 18:34.200
YOU PULL OVER AND PLACE
THE TRACKING DEVICE

18:34.243 --> 18:36.289
INSIDE THE FEAR TOXIN
CANISTER.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.291
THAT WILL LEAD US
TO WHERE THEY HAVE ANGELIQUE.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.336
OK. WHEN'S
THE INTERVIEW?

18:40.380 --> 18:43.513
WITHOUT THE CROWS,
I HAD TO REACH OUT TO SOMEONE

18:43.557 --> 18:45.428
FOR HELP SETTING IT UP,

18:45.472 --> 18:47.169
BUT DON'T WORRY.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.692
HE'S TRUSTWORTHY.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.262
RYAN...IS IT?

18:53.306 --> 18:54.611
LOOK HERE.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.964
NO PROB, LARRY.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.401
LUKE.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.359
-LUKE. SORRY, SORRY.
-NO WORRIES.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.231
YOU'RE MARY'S
ROOMMATE, YEAH?

19:05.274 --> 19:06.493
MM-HMM. YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:06.536 --> 19:08.364
I ACTUALLY THINK I SERVED
YOU HERE ONCE.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.801
-OH.
-SHIRLEY TEMPLE, RIGHT?

19:10.845 --> 19:12.673
I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS ME.

19:12.716 --> 19:15.241
CAN WE SAVE THE GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER PART
FOR LATER?

19:15.284 --> 19:19.114
-COME ON.
-YEAH.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.463
ALL RIGHT.

19:20.507 --> 19:24.250
I JUST DEPLOYED
YOUR FALSE IDENTITY.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.860
ROBYN WILDE?

19:25.903 --> 19:27.731
YEAH. IT'S
HARDER TO SCREW UP

19:27.775 --> 19:30.821
IF IT'S CLOSER
TO YOUR REAL NAME.

19:30.865 --> 19:33.389
SO YOU ARE
A FAST AND FURIOUS
GETAWAY DRIVER

19:33.433 --> 19:35.391
WITH A RAP SHEET
10 MILES LONG,

19:35.435 --> 19:37.437
AND I'M GONNA SPOOF
A TEXT MESSAGE

19:37.480 --> 19:39.395
FROM A KNOWN FALSE FACE
ASSOCIATE

19:39.439 --> 19:41.397
RECOMMENDING YOU
FOR THE JOB.

19:43.051 --> 19:44.705
AND...

19:44.748 --> 19:46.750
DONE.

19:46.794 --> 19:50.232
LUKE, I OWE YOU ONE.
THANKS.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.320
NO PROBLEM.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.061
I'M GONNA GO GAS UP
THE CAR.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.112
-WHAT'S THIS?
-COMMS FOR US

20:01.156 --> 20:03.027
TO COMMUNICATE
WITHOUT SOPHIE KNOWING,

20:03.071 --> 20:05.465
A TRACKER TO PLACE
ON THE FEAR TOXIN,

20:05.508 --> 20:08.250
AND A PORTABLE VERSION
OF THE BATMOBILE'S AI.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.296
AI? WHAT AI?

20:10.339 --> 20:13.821
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
I INSTALLED IT
WITH THE NEW PAINT JOB?

20:13.864 --> 20:15.344
WHAT?!

20:15.388 --> 20:17.999
I THOUGHT MY DRIVING SKILLS
WERE GETTING BETTER.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.479
YEAH, NO.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.089
HOOK IT UP
TO MARY'S RIDE

20:21.132 --> 20:23.309
SO YOU DON'T BOUNCE
OFF TOO MANY WALLS.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.311
FINE.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.573
HEY.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.881
I'M JUST GONNA
SAY IT.

20:30.925 --> 20:33.319
I REALIZE ANG IS
IN TROUBLE,

20:33.362 --> 20:37.366
BUT YOU TEAMING UP
WITH SOPHIE LIKE THIS,
THESE LIES,

20:37.410 --> 20:39.238
IT'S A BAD IDEA, OK?

20:39.281 --> 20:41.022
SHE'S GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHO YOU ARE.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.285
SHE'S SMART.

20:43.329 --> 20:46.375
SHE STILL THINKS I'M LUCKY
NOT TO BE IN JAIL.

20:46.419 --> 20:48.072
I'LL BE FINE.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.730
YOU SAID
CONFRONT KATE,

20:53.774 --> 20:56.472
SO I DESTROYED
THAT LITTLE SNOT-NOSED TWERP,

20:56.516 --> 20:59.388
AND THEN OCEAN COMES IN
AND RUINS IT!

20:59.432 --> 21:01.695
I WASN'T EVEN THINKING
ABOUT HIM!

21:01.738 --> 21:03.697
WHEN SAFIYAH ORDERED
ME TO ERASE

21:03.740 --> 21:05.351
YOUR MEMORIES OF OCEAN,

21:05.394 --> 21:06.613
YOU BEGGED ME
NOT TO DO IT.

21:06.656 --> 21:08.397
HA HA HA! BEGGED?

21:08.441 --> 21:10.660
EITHER YOU'RE BEING DRAMATIC,
OR I WAS.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.488
OCEAN CAME BACK
INTO YOUR LIFE

21:12.532 --> 21:14.229
AND UNLOCKED A PIECE
OF YOUR MEMORY,

21:14.273 --> 21:15.317
WHICH IS PROOF THAT KATE,

21:15.361 --> 21:18.755
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS,
WAS CORRECT.

21:18.799 --> 21:22.237
YOU ARE CAPABLE
OF EMOTION AND ATTACHMENT.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.334
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU'RE WRONG?

21:34.380 --> 21:38.122
BECAUSE I KILLED OCEAN,

21:38.166 --> 21:41.865
AND I FELT...NOTHING.

21:43.998 --> 21:49.003
SO RIP THESE HIDEOUS GHOSTS

WE GOT TO CALL

27:19.681 --> 27:23.990
SOPHIE, COME BOW DOWN
TO YOUR GIRL!

27:24.033 --> 27:27.210
-RYAN.
-HEY! WHERE'S SOPHIE?

27:27.254 --> 27:28.777
SHE ASKED FOR
THE TRACKER DATA

27:28.821 --> 27:30.649
AND TOLD ME TO MEET
YOU GUYS HERE.

27:32.520 --> 27:36.002
OH. SHE DITCHED US
FOR THE CROWS?

27:36.045 --> 27:38.744
NO. NO, NO, NO. SHE--

27:38.787 --> 27:43.357
SHE WAS TOO WORRIED
THEY'D STORM THE PLACE
AND KILL ANG.

27:48.536 --> 27:51.191
SHE'S TAKING ON
FALSE FACE HERSELF.

27:53.889 --> 27:56.631
CUT DEEPER THIS TIME.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.894
I WANT OCEAN GONE.

28:05.988 --> 28:07.816
SHUT YOUR EYES.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.736
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

28:19.654 --> 28:24.528
FOCUS ON WHAT YOUR
SENSES ARE TELLING YOU,

28:24.572 --> 28:26.705
WHAT YOU HEAR...

28:27.793 --> 28:30.012
WHAT YOU FEEL.

28:48.901 --> 28:50.685
WHOA. THAT HAPPENED FAST.

28:50.729 --> 28:54.210
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU'D
RATHER BE HERE WITH ME.

28:54.254 --> 28:57.039
ARE WE SURE WE'RE
IN MY SUBCONSCIOUS?

28:57.083 --> 28:59.825
WHAT AM I DOING
IN OCEAN'S SEX DREAM?

28:59.868 --> 29:03.785
I'M GUESSING YOU
BROUGHT ME HERE

29:03.829 --> 29:05.874
TO APOLOGIZE.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.528
UGH!

29:10.836 --> 29:12.620
WHY'D YOU KILL ME?

29:14.056 --> 29:16.102
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO KNOW?

29:16.145 --> 29:19.235
YOU KILLED ME
FOR NOTHING.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.674
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME TO ME.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.851
NO. NO CHANCE IN HELL.

29:25.894 --> 29:29.202
THERE'S SCREWED UP,
AND THEN THERE'S YOU.

29:43.303 --> 29:46.132
IS THIS REAL?
THIS FEELS REAL.

29:46.175 --> 29:50.092
YOU TELL ME. I THOUGHT
YOU SAID YOU KILLED HIM.

29:50.136 --> 29:53.574
I'M ALIVE
AND VERY PISSED OFF.

30:03.627 --> 30:08.067
I--STABBED YOU.
I WATCHED YOU DIE.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.416
LET'S ROLL
THE REPLAY.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.635
SAFIYAH WANTED
ME DEAD.

30:11.679 --> 30:14.421
SHE ENLISTED A WOMAN
WHO COULD TWIRL
A BALISONG IN HER SLEEP

30:14.464 --> 30:20.993
BUT INSISTED YOU USE
ONE OF HER KNIVES INSTEAD.

30:21.036 --> 30:22.472
SHE DIPPED THE BLADE
IN DESERT ROSE.

30:22.516 --> 30:28.391
HMM. DIDN'T I SAY
YOU'RE A CRAPPY ASSASSIN?

30:28.435 --> 30:31.133
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE
WORKING FOR SAFIYAH.

30:31.177 --> 30:34.876
HER FANCY, OUT-OF-NETWORK
LOBOTOMIST STOLE OUR MEMORIES.

30:34.920 --> 30:38.097
WE DESERVED WORSE.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.925
I BETRAYED MY SISTER.

30:39.968 --> 30:44.103
I JEOPARDIZED
MY ENTIRE ISLAND'S
SAFETY BECAUSE OF YOU,

30:44.146 --> 30:46.627
AN OUTSIDER.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.803
I'M IN GOTHAM
ON OTHER BUSINESS,

30:48.847 --> 30:52.024
BUT I THOUGHT I'D
TRACK YOU DOWN,
LOOK YOU IN THE EYE,

30:52.067 --> 30:54.330
AND ASK YOU MYSELF...

30:56.028 --> 30:58.117
WHY'D YOU DO IT?

31:00.162 --> 31:02.861
I'M RELIEVED MY OTHER
VICTIMS CAN'T ASK ME
THE SAME.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.210
ALICE!

31:07.735 --> 31:09.693
I NEED TO KNOW.

31:13.175 --> 31:16.787
IF I REGRET IT?

31:16.831 --> 31:24.230
IF I'VE THOUGHT OF YOU
EVERY DAY SINCE CORYANA?

31:27.755 --> 31:31.933
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
I COULD GET MY SISTER BACK.

31:38.157 --> 31:39.941
UNH!

31:39.985 --> 31:42.248
SEE? MANIPULATOR.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.780
MOCKINGBIRD ANEW.

31:58.307 --> 31:59.918
WHAT DID YOU DO?

31:59.961 --> 32:05.401
THE ONE THING I PROMISED
SAFIYAH I WOULD NEVER DO.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.708
YOU'LL BE FINE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

32:09.884 --> 32:11.233
CIAO.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.804
YOU'LL FORGET
ALL ABOUT OCEAN

32:16.847 --> 32:19.024
AND YOUR LOVE
FOR EACH OTHER!

32:19.067 --> 32:20.416
SAFIYAH, NO.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.984
YOU--YOU CAN'T
DO THIS.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.725
I REMEMBER US.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.989
HI.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.951
EVERYTHING.

32:41.176 --> 32:43.744
SHE'S UNLOCKING
OUR MEMORIES.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.408
UGH!

33:12.599 --> 33:16.646
♪ YOU
SHOULDN'T BE HERE ♪

33:16.690 --> 33:18.735
-WHERE'S ANGELIQUE?
-NO, NO, NO.

33:18.779 --> 33:22.522
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
ASKING THE QUESTIONS.

33:22.565 --> 33:25.046
HOW DID YOU FIND
THIS PLACE?

33:26.656 --> 33:30.660
WHY DID YOU COME
HERE ALONE?

33:30.704 --> 33:32.010
UNH!

33:38.146 --> 33:41.976
IF I ONLY KILL
ONE CROW TODAY,

33:42.020 --> 33:44.457
I'LL FALL ASLEEP
DEPRESSED.

33:47.721 --> 33:48.983
UGH!

33:56.034 --> 33:59.298
I HAVE EYES
ON CROWS HEADQUARTERS.

33:59.341 --> 34:03.824
THERE'S NO ACTIVITY,
THERE'S NO STRIKE TEAM
BEING MOBILIZED.

34:03.867 --> 34:07.393
YOU DID COME HERE
ALONE, DIDN'T YOU?

34:07.436 --> 34:09.134
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.787
IT'S FUNNY.
WHEN I TOLD THE BAT

34:10.831 --> 34:13.007
HOW PERSONAL
THIS WAS TO ME,

34:13.051 --> 34:15.923
I THOUGHT THE CROWS
WOULD TAKE ME
MORE SERIOUSLY,

34:15.966 --> 34:17.490
NOT LESS.

34:18.795 --> 34:22.103
OH, SHE DIDN'T
TELL YOU.

34:22.147 --> 34:25.324
WELL, THAT'S
AN EMBARRASSING
LACK OF COORDINATION.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.978
-WE'LL WORK ON IT.
-NO, YOU WON'T.

34:28.022 --> 34:30.242
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
FOUND THIS FACILITY,

34:30.285 --> 34:33.636
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT
TO ME THAT YOU'RE
NOT FOLLOWED.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.248
DON'T WORRY, THOUGH.

34:36.291 --> 34:38.206
I'LL MAKE SURE
WE DUMP YOUR BODY

34:38.250 --> 34:39.599
SOMEWHERE THEY'LL FIND IT.

35:04.232 --> 35:05.886
COME ON.

35:11.761 --> 35:14.373
SO THIS IS
HOW IT GOES, HUH?

35:14.416 --> 35:17.289
SHE SAVES YOU,
YOU SAVE HER. SWEET,

35:17.332 --> 35:20.074
BUT NOW WHO'S LEFT
TO SAVE YOU BOTH?

35:20.118 --> 35:21.206
HUH!

35:21.249 --> 35:22.859
UNH!

35:27.299 --> 35:28.517
WE'RE TIRED
OF YOUR CRAP.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.258
WE DON'T NEED ANYONE ELSE
SAVING US.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.956
ANGELIQUE.
WHERE IS SHE?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.133
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO SHOW YOU.

35:39.615 --> 35:43.053
WAVE HELLO TO YOUR
FANS, ANGELIQUE.

35:45.317 --> 35:48.102
HEY. I NEED YOU
TO WATCH

35:48.146 --> 35:50.365
AS THESE TWO
LET ME GO,

35:50.409 --> 35:52.802
AND IF THEY DON'T,

35:52.846 --> 35:55.022
I NEED YOU TO
SHOOT HER.

36:14.259 --> 36:18.785
OHH. NOW THAT IS SOME
TERRIFIC BRANDING,

36:18.828 --> 36:22.136
BUT YOU SHOULD REALLY
CONSIDER BRINGING A GUN

36:22.180 --> 36:24.182
TO A GUN FIGHT.

36:35.454 --> 36:38.283
SORRY FOR THE DELAY
GETTING THESE DELIVERED.

36:38.326 --> 36:41.068
MINOR CATASTROPHE
AT MY WAREHOUSE.

36:41.111 --> 36:43.462
MONDAYS, YOU KNOW.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.333
THINGS BETTER HERE?

36:45.377 --> 36:47.379
JUST FINISHED
THE FIRST COOK,

36:47.422 --> 36:49.250
BUT THIS IS ALL-NEW
EQUIPMENT,

36:49.294 --> 36:51.470
AND I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT HOW WE
SHOULD ROLL IT OUT.

36:51.513 --> 36:54.386
WELL, I THOUGHT WE MIGHT
ALLOW YOU TO BE

36:54.429 --> 36:56.301
THE CEREMONIAL
FIRST RECIPIENT.

36:56.344 --> 36:59.173
ACTUALLY, I'M SOBER.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.262
YOU DON'T WANT ME
LOSE MY TIME, DO YOU?

37:01.306 --> 37:03.395
COULDN'T CARE LESS,
MY DEAR.

37:03.438 --> 37:06.311
WAIT!

37:06.354 --> 37:09.662
I WAS OCEAN'S ASSISTANT,
BUT HE NEVER GAVE ME
THE FULL TECHNIQUE.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.620
I HAD TO GUESS.

37:11.664 --> 37:14.319
AND THIS FORMULA
COULD BE DEADLY?

37:14.362 --> 37:18.584
OHH. YOU ARE AN ENDLESS
DISAPPOINTMENT.

37:18.627 --> 37:21.282
OH! I'LL HELP YOU
FIND OCEAN.

37:31.336 --> 37:34.034
HOW'D YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND ME?

37:34.077 --> 37:37.167
GOT LUCKY. SAFIYAH
GAVE ME ENIGMA'S INFO

37:37.211 --> 37:39.779
AND TOLD ME TO USE IT
IF I NEEDED HELP
ON MY MISSION,

37:39.822 --> 37:42.172
SO WHEN I CALLED
THE DOC YESTERDAY,

37:42.216 --> 37:45.393
SHE SAID SOMEONE
WAS TRACKING HER,

37:45.437 --> 37:48.091
THAT HER IDENTITY
MIGHT BE BLOWN.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.876
FIGURED IT WAS YOU.

37:49.919 --> 37:53.445
AND THIS SUPERSECRET
MISSION SAFIYAH
SENT YOU ON?

37:53.488 --> 37:56.317
YOU DESTROYED ALL
OF THE DESERT ROSE
ON CORYANA.

37:56.361 --> 37:59.581
SHE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE,
LIKE, A SEED BUNKER
OR SOMETHING?

37:59.625 --> 38:01.279
NEVER THOUGHT
WE NEEDED ONE.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.411
THAT ISLAND HAD BEEN
SAFE FOR HUNDREDS
OF YEARS

38:03.455 --> 38:05.239
UNTIL YOU CAME AROUND.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.936
PUT THAT UP
ON MY WALL.

38:06.980 --> 38:08.938
SAFIYAH THOUGHT
OUR FAMILY'S LEGACY
WAS DESTROYED

38:08.982 --> 38:12.464
UNTIL I TOLD HER
THERE WAS ONE PLANT LEFT.

38:12.507 --> 38:14.379
THE ONE YOU STOLE.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.774
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE IT IS?

38:18.818 --> 38:21.299
SAFIYAH THINKS
BATWOMAN HAS IT.

38:23.388 --> 38:26.434
THAT'S WHY SHE'S NOT DEAD
FROM KRYPTONITE POISONING.

38:26.478 --> 38:29.568
LOOK. I MADE MY FEELINGS

38:29.611 --> 38:33.789
VERY CLEAR ON CORYANA
BOTH TIMES.

38:33.833 --> 38:38.228
YOU'VE BEEN...HARDER
TO READ,

38:38.272 --> 38:40.883
WHAT WITH THE STABBING
AND ALL.

38:45.497 --> 38:47.629
DO YOU REGRET IT?

38:49.718 --> 38:51.111
DOES IT MATTER?

38:51.154 --> 38:53.679
ANSWER THE DAMN
QUESTION.

38:55.420 --> 38:59.989
I HAD A WORLD-CLASS SHRINK
TELL ME THAT I WAS
A MONSTER TODAY, SO...

39:00.033 --> 39:05.734
DO...YOU...
REGRET IT?

39:05.778 --> 39:08.171
ARE YOU NOT HEARING ME?

39:08.215 --> 39:09.912
I LITERALLY HAD IT IN ME

39:09.956 --> 39:13.220
TO STAB A KNIFE
THROUGH YOUR HEART.

39:15.222 --> 39:16.484
SO?

39:21.010 --> 39:22.272
SO...

39:25.101 --> 39:26.799
JUST IN CASE
I GET THE URGE AGAIN,

39:26.842 --> 39:31.064
WE SHOULD, UM, PROBABLY
GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE WAY.

39:38.767 --> 40:00.441
♪ BURN IT DOWN

40:05.968 --> 40:07.405
DAMN.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.033
AGENT TAVAROFF.

40:27.076 --> 40:29.122
THINK WE'VE GOT
EVERYHTING WE NEED HERE.

40:29.165 --> 40:30.776
WE'LL MEET YOU BACK
AT THE LAB.

40:30.819 --> 40:34.475
THANK YOU. I'LL BE
A FEW MINUTES BEHIND YOU.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.624
YOU'LL BE FINE.

41:36.668 --> 41:38.974
IT WORKS IN REMOTE JUST
LIKE YOUR BATMOBILE.

41:42.587 --> 41:46.025
OHH. I'M REALLY
MISSING MY BATSUIT RIGHT NOW.

41:47.592 --> 41:49.158
OH, MY GOD.

42:20.059 --> 42:22.278
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
