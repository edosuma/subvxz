WEBVTT

00:01.930 --> 00:03.090
PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'ITLE LIARS...

00:03.130 --> 00:04.199
MRS. GRUNWALD?

00:04.230 --> 00:05.492
IT WAS THREE SUMMERS AGO.

00:05.530 --> 00:07.236
SHE THOUGHT THAT
SOMEBODY WAS AFTER HER,

00:07.270 --> 00:09.568
SO MAYBE SHE WAS ASKING
FOR HELP OR A PLACE TO STAY.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.066
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

00:11.110 --> 00:11.906
I THOUGHT WE'D DONE
A GOOD JOB

00:11.940 --> 00:13.430
OF ESTABLISHING
A SENSE OF TRUST.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.732
THAT WAS BEFORE I REALIZED
WHERE YOUR LOYALTIES WERE.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.172
( both gasp )

00:20.220 --> 00:21.312
WHO ELSE KNOWS
ABOUT MY MOTHER?

00:21.350 --> 00:23.238
KEEPING THIS A SECRET HAS MEANT
THAT I'VE HAD TO CHOOSE

00:23.290 --> 00:24.439
BETWEEN YOU AND THEM.

00:24.490 --> 00:25.479
AND YOU CHOSE THEM.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.408
JAKE. WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

00:27.460 --> 00:28.688
YOU GOTTA LET
HER MOVE ON.

00:28.720 --> 00:29.755
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO EZRA?

00:29.790 --> 00:31.382
I CAN'T, EMILY.
I TOLD YOU.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.250
THIS ISN'T ABOUT JAKE.
HE'S LOSING MALCOLM.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.188
REALLY RATHER NOT
DRAG YOU INTO IT.

00:35.230 --> 00:36.492
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING, EZRA.

00:36.530 --> 00:38.066
I KNOW YOU'RE
MOM'S INNOCENT.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.397
WAIT. YOU WERE
AT THE LAKE THAT NIGHT?

00:39.440 --> 00:42.409
YOU HEARD THE GUNSHOTS
AFTER MRS. MARIN DROVE OFF?

00:42.440 --> 00:44.101
SHE WASN'T THERE
WHEN HE WAS KILLED.

00:44.140 --> 00:45.107
THAT'S JENNA'S CAR.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.199
( tires screech )
WHO IS JENNA SO AFRAID OF?

00:47.240 --> 00:49.344
CeCe DRAKE.

00:50.650 --> 00:51.878
Reporter:
AN EYE WITNESS
HAS STEPPED FORWARD

00:51.910 --> 00:54.617
AND UNCONFIRMED INSIDE
SOURCES SAY THIS WITNESS
( doorbell )

00:54.650 --> 00:56.538
HAS DETAILED INFORMATION
ABOUT THE CRIME

00:56.590 --> 00:57.682
AND THE PARTIES INVOLVED.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.119
SO FAR,
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS...

00:59.160 --> 01:00.559
( shuts TV off)

01:00.590 --> 01:01.659
I DON'T GET IT.

01:01.690 --> 01:04.124
WHY WOULD THE COPS WANT MY
MOM TO COME IN FOR A LINE UP

01:04.160 --> 01:05.752
IF TRAVIS TOLD THE TRUTH?

01:05.790 --> 01:08.588
DO YOU THINK THAT "A" FOUND
A WAY TO SHUT HIM UP AGAIN?

01:08.630 --> 01:10.166
HANNA, DON'T GO THERE.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.168
TRAVIS MADE YOU A PROMISE,

01:12.200 --> 01:13.531
AND HE SEEMS LIKE
A STAND-UP GUY.

01:13.570 --> 01:16.107
PLUS HE'S REALLY CUTE.
AND HE'S QUITE THE DANCER.

01:16.140 --> 01:17.767
IT'S ADDRESSED
TO ALL OF US.

01:38.230 --> 01:41.290
"IF SHE GOES FREE,"

01:41.330 --> 01:42.422
"YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME."

01:42.470 --> 01:44.426
"KISSES"

01:44.470 --> 01:46.597
IIAII

01:46.640 --> 01:48.198
SO IF MY MOM GETS OFF...

01:48.240 --> 01:50.265
CeCe IS COMING FOR US.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.663
I SAY, BRING IT.

01:51.710 --> 01:53.473
MAYBE THEN, SHE'LL LEAVE
OUR PARENTS ALONE.

01:54.910 --> 01:58.300
OR DID SHE JUST DECLARE
WORD WAR "A"?

02:01.220 --> 02:02.346
* GOT A SECRET

02:02.390 --> 02:03.789
* CAN YOU KEEP IT?

02:03.820 --> 02:05.742
* SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE

02:05.790 --> 02:08.350
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

02:08.390 --> 02:10.881
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

02:10.930 --> 02:13.296
* IF I SHOW YOU
THEN I KNOW YOU *

02:13.330 --> 02:15.696
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

02:15.730 --> 02:18.528
* 'CAUSE TWO
CAN KEEP A SECRET *

02:18.570 --> 02:20.834
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

02:23.870 --> 02:25.064
OKAY, TRAVIS.

02:25.110 --> 02:28.500
WE NEED A POSITIVE ID
OF THE WOMAN YOU SAW
LEAVING THE SCENE

02:28.540 --> 02:29.802
BEFORE THE SHOTS WERE FIRED.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.908
OKAY.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.747
TAKE YOUR TIME.

02:32.780 --> 02:34.475
Guard:
NUMBER ONE, STEP FORWARD.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.449
Guard:
STEP BACK.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.219
NUMBER TWO, STEP FORWARD.

02:48.660 --> 02:51.629
STEP BACK.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.869
I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO THIS.

03:00.510 --> 03:04.401
NOW, I'M SURE YOU ALL REMEMBER
THE WITCHES FROM MACBETH

03:04.450 --> 03:06.645
AND THE FAIRIES AND FORESTS
OF A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,

03:06.680 --> 03:10.241
BUT BEYOND HAVING A SORCERER
AS A PROTAGONIST,

03:10.290 --> 03:13.418
THE TEMPEST CONSIDERS
THE MAGICAL QUALITY
OF LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.850
THE LOVE BETWEEN MIRANDA
AND FERDINAND

03:16.890 --> 03:19.723
IS A FORCE OF NATURE.

03:19.760 --> 03:22.490
A LOVE THAT REUNITES
TORN COUNTRIES

03:22.530 --> 03:25.397
AND SETS CAPTIVE
SPIRITS FREE.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.364
( bell rings )

03:27.400 --> 03:30.631
MAKE SURE TO READ THE
FIRST ACT FOR NEXT WEEK.

03:33.310 --> 03:35.528
MISS MONTGOMERY,
CAN I HAVE A MINUTE
OF YOUR TIME?

03:43.850 --> 03:46.318
THANKS FOR COMING
OVER LAST NIGHT.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.329
I REALLY NEEDED YOU,
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO ASK.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.521
YEAH, OF COURSE.
I'M GLAD THAT I COULD
BE THERE FOR YOU.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.388
AS A FRIEND.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.438
( cell phone rings )

04:07.380 --> 04:10.474
HEY. ARE WE STILL
ON FOR TONIGHT?

04:10.510 --> 04:12.819
COOL. THERE'S THIS POETRY
READING AT THE BREW.

04:12.850 --> 04:15.876
THEY'RE CALLING HIM A
CONTEMPORARY POE.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.445
OH. SURE.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.811
NO. NO, NO, NO.
IT'S, UM...

04:20.860 --> 04:24.557
IT'S COOL. WE CAN DO DINNER
AND A MOVIE OR SOMETHING.

04:24.590 --> 04:25.818
MM-HMM.

04:25.860 --> 04:28.294
ALL RIGHT, BYE.
( phone beeps )

04:41.440 --> 04:43.044
THANK YOU.

04:43.080 --> 04:43.842
NO. DON'T THANK ME YET.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.007
THEY PROBABLY MADE
IT YESTERDAY.

04:46.050 --> 04:48.575
NOT FOR THE COFFEE.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.542
FOR THE WAY YOU'VE
TAKEN CARE OF HANNA.

04:52.090 --> 04:54.650
I DON'T WORRY ABOUT HER
AS MUCH WHEN SHE'S WITH YOU.

05:00.530 --> 05:02.020
( sighs )

05:02.060 --> 05:06.019
MRS. MARIN, YOU DIDN'T
DESERVE ANY OF THIS.

05:06.070 --> 05:10.666
BUT I'VE WATCHED THE WAY
THAT YOU'VE HANDLED IT.

05:14.710 --> 05:16.075
HANNA NEVER SETTLES.

05:16.110 --> 05:18.943
WHEN SHE GOES AFTER
SOMETHING, SHE'S FEARLESS.

05:18.980 --> 05:22.541
NOW I KNOW WHERE
SHE GETS THAT.

05:22.590 --> 05:26.959
WELL, I'VE HAD MY MOMENTS,
I PROMISE YOU.

05:26.990 --> 05:29.879
YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T BREAK.

05:31.730 --> 05:34.949
CALEB, AFTER ALL
THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.093
YOU CAN CALL ME ASHLEY.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.961
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
HELL IS TAKING SO LONG.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.968
I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.661
HERE THEY COME.

05:44.770 --> 05:47.705
MRS. MARIN, I'M SIDNEY BARNES,
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.742
I JUST WANTED TO TELL
YOU THIS MYSELF.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.101
WE'RE DROPPING THE CHARGES
AGAINST YOU.

05:52.150 --> 05:53.845
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.040
( light gasp )

06:06.030 --> 06:08.157
I'M THRILLED FOR
HANNA AND HER MOM,

06:08.200 --> 06:09.758
BUT I'M WORRIED FOR YOU.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.119
IF "A" MAKES GOOD
ON HER THREAT--

06:11.170 --> 06:13.434
"A" IS A TERRORIST.
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.

06:13.470 --> 06:16.166
TO MAKE US WORRY.
AND WE CAN'T GIVE INTO HER.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.407
I'D FEEL BETTER IF WE
KNEW WHERE CeCe WAS.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.601
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, IT FEELS
LIKE SHE'S EVERWVHERE.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.971
WELL, WE KNOW WHO
TO LOOK OUT FOR NOW.

06:22.010 --> 06:25.605
WE'RE SO CLOSE TO PUTTING
AND END TO THIS GAME, PAIGE.
I CAN FEEL IT.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.010
HOW ABOUT UNTIL WE DO,

06:30.050 --> 06:31.642
YOU SPEND THE NIGHTS
AT MY HOUSE.

06:31.690 --> 06:35.558
I'LL KNOW YOU'RE SAFE
AND WE'LL GET TO BE TOGETHER.

06:38.730 --> 06:41.153
I NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

06:41.200 --> 06:45.694
SO, PLEASE JUST CALL
EMILY OR CALEB.

06:45.730 --> 06:47.630
JUST CHECK IN.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.934
PLEASE.

07:13.060 --> 07:15.790
MRS. MARIN,
YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.195
PASTOR TED'S JAW
IS GONNA HIT THE FLOOR

07:17.230 --> 07:19.061
WHEN HE SEES YOU
IN THAT DRESS.
IT'S NOT TOO MUCH?

07:19.100 --> 07:21.591
All girls: NO!
Hanna: MOM, YOU LOOK PERFECT.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.767
AND TED MAY HAVE
THE PATIENCE OF A SAINT,

07:23.810 --> 07:25.004
BUT HE'S STILL A MAN.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.029
HE'S BEEN WAITING A WHILE.

07:26.070 --> 07:29.073
SO GO OUT AND HAVE FUN.

07:29.110 --> 07:31.908
I LOVE YOU, HONEY.
LOVE YOU, TOO, MOM.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.679
BYE, GIRLS.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.211
All: BYE!

07:36.250 --> 07:37.683
( door closes )

07:39.590 --> 07:41.558
WHERE DO WE START?

07:41.590 --> 07:44.479
LET'S START AT THE ENDS,
AND I WILL MEET YOU IN THE
MIDDLE FOR DESSERT.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.521
( doorbell rings )

07:46.560 --> 07:47.891
SHE FORGOT HER KEYS.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.804
IT'S FOR ALL OF US.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.249
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE
JUST DON'T OPEN IT?

08:04.280 --> 08:06.646
WE CAN'T WIN THE GAME
IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

08:18.860 --> 08:20.748
IT'S A KID'S COFFIN, RIGHT?

08:26.570 --> 08:30.563
( gasps ) IT'S MONA.

08:33.340 --> 08:36.002
( all phones chime )

08:37.250 --> 08:39.070
"HANNA WINS, SO MONA LOSES.

08:39.110 --> 08:41.613
"FIND HER BEFORE THE COPS,
OR--

08:53.630 --> 08:54.619
Reporter:
BREAKING NEWS IN
THE MURDER INVESTIGATION

08:55.260 --> 08:56.966
OF DETECTIVE DARREN WILDEN.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.729
HAN NA.

08:58.770 --> 08:59.930
SHE'S ON THE
PHONE WITH RADLEY.

08:59.970 --> 09:02.837
RELEASED A SKETCH OF A
POSSIBLE SUSPECT IN THE CASE.

09:02.870 --> 09:03.962
IF YOU HAVE ANY...

09:04.010 --> 09:06.604
THAT'S CeCe.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.609
OH, MY GOD.
SHE REALLY DID DO IT.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.641
THEY HAVEN'T ID'd HER YET,
BUT SOMEBODY'S
GONNA RECOGNIZE HER.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.819
WELL THEN, WE BETTER
FIND MONA FAST.

09:13.850 --> 09:15.670
OKAY. THAN KS.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.848
MONA IS NO LONGER
A PATIENT AT BRADLEY.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.209
WHAT?

09:20.260 --> 09:21.852
RELEASED OR SENT
TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL?

09:21.890 --> 09:23.755
IT'S PRIVILEGED
INFORMATION.

09:23.790 --> 09:25.951
I'LL GO MAKE A HOUSE CALL
TO DR. WREN. HE'S PRIVILEGED.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.924
EMILY, CAN YOU CIRCLE
BACK TO SCHOOL?

09:27.960 --> 09:30.019
IT'S FRENCH CLUB FRIDAY,
SO MAYBE SOMEBODY'S
HEARD FROM HER?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.367
YEAH, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO MEET UP WITH PAIGE,

09:31.400 --> 09:32.799
BUT I'LL JUST TAKE
HER WITH ME.

09:33.940 --> 09:35.168
I WAS SUPPOSED TO
COOK DINNER FOR JAKE,

09:35.200 --> 09:36.929
BUT I'LL JUST CANCEL.
NO!

09:36.970 --> 09:38.608
YOU KNOW WHAT CeCe'S
CAPABLE OF.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.607
KEEP JET LI
AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN.

09:41.640 --> 09:42.777
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:42.810 --> 09:43.777
TO FIND MONA.

09:43.810 --> 09:45.346
HAN NA, SLOW DOWN.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.348
THIS COULD BE YOUR EX-BFF
MESSING WITH US.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.143
SHE'S PROBABLY
EATING POPCORN,

09:49.180 --> 09:50.989
WATCHING US PLAY
DESPERATELY SEEKING MONA.

09:51.020 --> 09:53.386
IF CeCe DOES HAVE HER,
THE COPS KNOW SHE
KILLED WILDEN.

09:53.420 --> 09:54.978
SHE HAS NOTHING TO LOSE.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.194
COME ON, WREN. BE HOME.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.172
( French chatter)

10:57.990 --> 10:59.241
YOU'RE JACKIE, RIGHT?

11:01.990 --> 11:03.685
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM MONA, HAVE YOU?

11:05.160 --> 11:06.752
SERIOUSLY?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.324
DOWNLOADED A FRENCH APP
WHEN I WAS IN HAITI.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.329
WOW, LOOK AT YOU.
GO AHEAD. PARLEZ VOUS.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.962
CROISSANT?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.433
NO, THAN KS.

11:14.470 --> 11:15.767

11:15.800 --> 11:19.304
"VOUS FAITES AVOIR

11:19.340 --> 11:22.309
DES NOUVELLES DE MONA?"

11:22.340 --> 11:25.070
ELLE A APPEL CE MATIN.
ELLE APPORTAIT LE CASSOULET.

11:27.450 --> 11:31.443
I THINK THAT MEANS
MONA WAS BRINGING A CASSEROLE.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.411
OKAY, CUT THE CRAP, JACKIE.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

11:35.460 --> 11:36.779
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HER OR NOT?

11:36.830 --> 11:39.048
SHE CALLED ME THIS MORNING.

11:39.090 --> 11:43.322
SHE WAS ON HER WAY HOME FROM
HER COURT-APPOINTED TIMEOUT.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.861
SHE TOLD ME
SHE WAS COMING TONIGHT.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.436
AND SHE JUST DIDN'T SHOW UP?

11:47.470 --> 11:50.030
NO, AND I'M REALLY SURPRISED
BECAUSE THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

11:50.070 --> 11:51.765
HER WELCOME BACK PARTY.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.406
* WATCHED TONIGHT

11:59.450 --> 12:02.886
* FOR AN HOUR

12:02.920 --> 12:05.718
* CARRY ON AND SETTLE LOW

12:08.290 --> 12:09.257
* TIME FLEW

12:09.290 --> 12:12.157
* AND I NEVER KNEW

12:14.030 --> 12:17.124
* WHERE IT ALL COULD GO

12:18.330 --> 12:21.891
* ONCE IN A WHILE

12:21.940 --> 12:25.364

BRINGS YOU BACK *

12:25.410 --> 12:26.399
( phone rings )

12:28.840 --> 12:31.104
* ONCE IN A WHILE

12:31.150 --> 12:33.812
* THE SMALLEST THING

12:33.850 --> 12:37.786
* BRINGS YOU BACK

12:37.820 --> 12:39.913
*TO ME

12:39.960 --> 12:43.282
* YES, IT DO

12:43.330 --> 12:44.922

* YES, IT DO

13:18.190 --> 13:19.179
( phone beeps )

13:22.330 --> 13:24.298
HEY, SPENCE, IT'S ME.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.890
WE HAVE TO TALK.

13:31.510 --> 13:32.408
Reporter on TV:
POLICE HAVE IDENTIFIED CeCe...

13:33.210 --> 13:34.507
I WANTED TO BELIEVE
THAT MY SISTER

13:34.540 --> 13:35.507
PULLED HERSELF
OUT OF THIS MESS

13:35.540 --> 13:36.905
WHEN SHE LEFT TOWN.

13:36.950 --> 13:40.340
WHAT IS SHANA'S
CONNECTION TO WREN?

13:40.380 --> 13:44.282
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND IS
MOVING IN WITH HIS EX-FIANCe.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.345
WHY WOULD THEY
KEEP THAT A SECRET?

13:46.390 --> 13:49.518
BECAUSE HE'S YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.994
Reporter on TV: TONIGHT,
THERE WILL BE SHOWERS...

13:56.030 --> 13:57.167
( shuts TV off)

13:59.630 --> 14:01.962
I WAN NA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.639
BUT IF I DO, ARE YOU
JUST GONNA TAKE OFF AGAIN?

14:04.670 --> 14:07.400
I HAD SOME THINKING TO DO.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.874
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.104
OKAY, YOU COULD'VE CALLED.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.913
YOU COULD'VE JUST
SENT ME A TEXT.

14:12.950 --> 14:14.474
"GIVE ME SPACE."
I KNOW.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.442
THREE WORDS
AND I WOULD'VE BEEN FINE.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.243
I KNOW, OKAY? AND I'M SORRY.

14:19.620 --> 14:21.087
YOU...

14:22.590 --> 14:24.581
YOU CAN'T JUST
DISAPPEAR LIKE THAT.

14:26.330 --> 14:27.888
NOT ANYMORE.

14:27.930 --> 14:30.421
NOT AFTER
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.429
WHEN I WORRY ABOUT "A"
GETTING A HOLD OF YOU OR--

14:34.470 --> 14:36.665
OR HURTING YOU, OR WORSE,

14:36.700 --> 14:41.034
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
A VERY REAL PICTURE OF WHAT
THAT LOOKS LIKE IN MY MIND.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.344
I WAS IN TOWN, SPENCER, OKAY?
I WAS RIGHT HERE.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.245
WELL, NOT FOR ME, YOU WEREN'T.

14:45.280 --> 14:48.943
WHEN I USED TO FEEL LIKE
THE WALLS WERE CLOSING IN,

14:48.980 --> 14:51.210
I'D TAKE OFF.

14:51.250 --> 14:54.083
BUT THIS TIME, I STAYED.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.348
FOR YOU.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.355
YOU WERE RIGHT.

14:58.390 --> 15:00.221
LAST NIGHT...

15:00.260 --> 15:03.297
TRYING TO BREAK IN
TO DR. PALMER'S CAR...

15:05.630 --> 15:08.428
THAT'S AS CLOSE
AS I WANNA GET TO "A."

15:15.440 --> 15:17.408
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO STOP LOOKING.

15:17.450 --> 15:22.376
YOU DESERVE TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR MOM.

15:22.420 --> 15:26.186
I DON'T WANT
"A's" VERSION OF THE TRUTH.

15:26.220 --> 15:28.415
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.192
( sighs )

15:39.700 --> 15:42.669
I'D LIKE A MORE DETAILED
DESCRIPTION OF THIS GIRL LUCY.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.008
YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.407
TAKE THIS. I'M HOGGING
THE KETTLE CORN.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.977
NO, SERIOUSLY,
I NEED AN INTERVENTION.

15:54.350 --> 15:55.476
( sighs )

15:55.520 --> 15:57.317
( screams )

16:01.020 --> 16:02.009
( chuckles )

16:04.490 --> 16:06.185
LONG DAY AND A GOOD MEAL.

16:06.230 --> 16:07.197
( yawns )

16:07.230 --> 16:09.596
IT GETS ME EVERY TIME.

16:09.630 --> 16:12.463
WELL, I COULD
MAKE US SOME COFFEE.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.489
NO.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.606
HONESTLY,
I COULD USE THE REST.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.507
WE'LL WATCH THE REST LATER?

16:21.540 --> 16:24.509
YEAH, SURE.

16:24.550 --> 16:25.539
THAN KS.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.078
I'LL CALL YOU.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.119
OKAY.

16:42.130 --> 16:43.097
BYE.

16:43.130 --> 16:44.119
BYE.

16:55.540 --> 16:59.146
HANNA, I SWEAR I SAW SOMEONE
IN THAT UPSTAIRS WINDOW.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.171
SO YOU THINK MONA'S JUST SITTING
IN HER HOUSE, IN THE DARK?

17:01.220 --> 17:02.619
( scoffs )
AS TWISTED AS SHE IS,

17:02.650 --> 17:04.618
I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HER.

17:04.650 --> 17:07.357
LOOK, SHE STUCK
HER NECK OUT FOR MY MOM.

17:07.390 --> 17:09.381
I KNOW AFTER
EVERYTHING SHE'S DONE,

17:09.420 --> 17:11.229
IT MAY SEEM LIKE
ANOTHER ONE OF HER TRICKS,

17:11.260 --> 17:13.228
BUT MONA WOULD'VE NEVER
CONFESSED TO KILLING WILDEN

17:13.260 --> 17:16.491
IF I DIDN'T PUT THAT IDEA
IN HER HEAD IN THE FIRST PLACE.

17:16.530 --> 17:18.521
HANNA, IF MONA
IS REALLY IN TROUBLE,

17:18.570 --> 17:20.162
IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.565
YOU'RE SAFE HERE, EM.

17:26.610 --> 17:29.306
IT'S NOT ME I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.546
IT'S MONA.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.047
Man: DOOR!

17:38.590 --> 17:40.285
SORRY.
DON'T BE.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.118
YOUR PARENTS WOULD HAVE
THE SAME RULE IF I WERE A GUY.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.721
IF YOU WERE A GUY,
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

17:50.400 --> 17:54.166
MAYBE WE SHOULD WATCH A MOVIE
TO TAKE YOUR MIND OFF THINGS.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.431
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD
SIT STILL FOR THAT LONG.

17:57.470 --> 17:58.698
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

17:58.740 --> 18:01.504
I GET WORRYING ABOUT CeCe,
BUT NOT MONA.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.144
SHE TRIED TO KILL YOU.

18:03.180 --> 18:05.341
I KNOW,
BUT WE CREATED THE BEAST.

18:05.380 --> 18:06.870
NO, ALI DID THAT.

18:06.910 --> 18:09.117
YEAH, AND WE LET HER.

18:09.150 --> 18:10.811
( sighs )

18:16.760 --> 18:18.751
( indistinct chatter )

18:26.800 --> 18:28.233
HOW WAS THE READING?

18:28.270 --> 18:30.158
INTENSE.

18:31.870 --> 18:34.577
ONE OF HIS POEMS
REMINDED ME OF THE STORY

18:34.610 --> 18:37.499
YOU WROTE ABOUT THE CAT,
"FOUND BUT LOST."

18:39.450 --> 18:41.441
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU REMEMBER THAT.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.184
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS ABOUT ALI.

18:46.220 --> 18:51.453
WELL, IT WAS,
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT
WHEN I WAS WRITING IT.

18:51.490 --> 18:55.529
PROBABLY WHY IT WAS SO HONEST.

18:59.800 --> 19:04.567
HI. UM, CAN I GET
A CAPPUCCINO?

19:04.610 --> 19:07.932
COULD I ACTUALLY
GET A REFILL, TOO?

19:11.810 --> 19:16.372
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN
WHAT'S TOUGH FOR ME,

19:16.420 --> 19:19.241
WRITING A GOOD STORY BEFORE
I CAN THINK MY WAY OUT OF IT.

19:19.290 --> 19:20.484
I GET IT.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.353
IT'S LIKE
YOU WANNA KNOW THE ENDING,

19:23.390 --> 19:26.518
BUT YOU STILL
WANNA BE SURPRISED.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.528
YEAH. I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

19:28.560 --> 19:31.267
I'D ALWAYS READ
THE LAST PAGE BEFORE...

19:31.300 --> 19:33.291
**

19:47.850 --> 19:49.511
* WHAT WAS A SPELL

19:49.550 --> 19:51.814
* NOW FEELS LIKE A CURSE

19:51.850 --> 19:56.583
* WONDER IF YOU
COULD LEAD FIRST *

20:02.830 --> 20:04.798
* CURIOUS SCHOOLS

20:04.830 --> 20:07.697
* WE BECOME FOOLS

20:11.710 --> 20:15.703
* THIS ISN'T CONTROL
THIS ISN'T CONTROL *

20:15.740 --> 20:19.449
* THIS ISN'T CONTROL
THIS ISN'T CONTROL *

20:19.480 --> 20:23.314
* THIS ISN'T CONTROL
THIS ISN'T CONTROL *

20:23.350 --> 20:27.719
* THIS ISN'T CONTROL
THIS ISN'T CONTROL *

20:27.760 --> 20:29.785
* LEFT BEHIND

20:29.820 --> 20:31.924
* THE PERFECT CRIME

20:31.960 --> 20:33.655
* LIKE A SWELL

20:33.700 --> 20:39.263
* HENCE SUBSIDE

20:50.810 --> 20:51.447
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT MONA.

20:53.780 --> 20:55.475
WE KNOW "A"
LIKES TO PLAY WITH US...

20:55.520 --> 20:57.909
BUT THIS TIME,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE GAME IS.

20:57.950 --> 21:01.613
IT'S, "I'M GOING DOWN
AND I'M DRAGGING YOU WITH ME."

21:01.660 --> 21:02.888
( doorbell rings )

21:05.330 --> 21:06.957
THEY KNOW WHO
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR NOW.

21:06.990 --> 21:08.958
THEY'RE GONNA FIND CeCe.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.867
( sighs )
"A" CAN'T EVEN GIVE US ONE DAY.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.767
I MEAN, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
AT HOME WITH MY MOM CELEBRATING,

21:14.800 --> 21:18.509
AND ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS POOR MONA.

21:18.540 --> 21:22.499
I NEVER, EVER THOUGHT THAT
WE'D BE SAYING "POOR MONA."

21:22.540 --> 21:24.644
GUYS, ANOTHER ONE.

21:44.830 --> 21:48.061
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.
IT'S JUST AN EMPTY BOX.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.536
OR MAYBE NOT.

21:52.910 --> 21:54.832
FOR ONCE, I'M RIGHT
AND YOU'RE WRONG, SPENCER.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.847
HOW DID YOU JUST DO THAT?

22:03.890 --> 22:05.983
TOOK HOME FIRST PRIZE
FOR MY MAGIC ACT
AT PERFORMING ARTS CAMP.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.556
OF COURSE YOU DID.

22:07.590 --> 22:11.321
"WATCH ME MAKE
A GIRL DISAPPEAR. KISSES, A"

22:12.460 --> 22:13.927
IT'S MAGIC.

22:13.960 --> 22:15.052
WHAT?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.795
"WATCH ME MAKE
A GIRL DISAPPEAR."

22:16.830 --> 22:19.424
"A" IS NOT PLAYING A GAME,
SHE'S PUTTING ON A MAGIC SHOW.

22:19.470 --> 22:20.835
WHY WOULD CeCe DO THAT?

22:20.870 --> 22:22.963
PEOPLE WANNA GO TO MAGIC SHOWS
TO BE DECEIVED.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.106
THEY WANNA BELIEVE IN SOMETHING
THEY KNOW CAN'T BE TRUE.

22:26.140 --> 22:30.372
WAIT, SO IF "A"
IS PUTTING ON A MAGIC SHOW
AND WE'RE THE AUDIENCE...

22:30.410 --> 22:31.900
NO, WE'RE NOT THE AUDIENCE.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.918
I THINK WE'RE
A PART OF HER ACT.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.947
AND SHE'S GONNA MAKE
MONA DISAPPEAR FOREVER.

22:47.160 --> 22:50.425
WAS IT ALL QUIET HERE
LAST NIGHT?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.665
YEAH, A LITTLE TOO QUIET.

22:52.700 --> 22:55.066
HANNA'S CONVINCED
THIS IS "A,"

22:55.100 --> 22:58.604
BUT IT SMELLS LIKE MONA TO ME.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.699
IF SHE WAS MISSING,
DON'T YOU THINK THAT HER PARENTS
WOULD CALL THE POLICE?

23:00.740 --> 23:03.743
OR MAYBE THEY DON'T KNOW.
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
OUT OF TOWN.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.874
I SWEAR, IF I FIND OUT THAT
THIS IS HER JERKING US AROUND,
I'M GONNA KILL HER MYSELF.

23:06.910 --> 23:08.468
DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.738
DOZED OFF FOR A FEW MINUTES
AFTER HANNA LEFT.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.679
WELL, GO HOME.
I'LL CALL YOU IF SHE SHOWS UP.

23:13.720 --> 23:16.450
OKAY. THAN KS.

23:24.130 --> 23:28.169
I GET THE MAGIC EIGHT BALL
CONNECTION, BUT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE SAW.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.907
WELL, IT'S DEBATABLE,
BUT MOST PEOPLE GIVE CREDIT

23:30.940 --> 23:34.171
TO TORRINI FOR BEING
THE FIRST ILLUSIONIST
TO SAW A WOMAN IN TWO.

23:34.210 --> 23:37.873
AND WHEN I SAW CHRISS ANGEL
DO IT, THE TOP HALF OF THE WOMAN
CRAWLED AWAY.

23:37.910 --> 23:40.913
IT WAS TOTALLY TWISTED,
BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT
HE JUST USED THIS WOMAN

23:40.950 --> 23:42.872
WITH SACRAL AGENESIS,
WHICH IS THIS CONGENITAL--

23:42.920 --> 23:45.445
OKAY, CAN YOU JUST
STOP TALKING, PLEASE?

23:48.120 --> 23:49.155
YEAH.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.157
OKAY.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.052
( chuckles ) NOPE. TRY AGAIN.

23:58.830 --> 24:02.732
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
IS THERE A MAGIC SHOP IN TOWN
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

24:02.770 --> 24:04.635
NOTHING.

24:04.670 --> 24:06.137
NO, NO, NO, CLICK HERE.

24:06.170 --> 24:08.934
"THE GREAT CHARLEMAGNE."

24:08.980 --> 24:12.643
HE'S PUTTING ON A SHOW
IN RAVENSWOOD THIS AFTERNOON.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.615
RAVENSWOOD?
THAT CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.785
SPENCE, YOU'RE DRIVING.

24:32.670 --> 24:33.864
( tires screech )

24:41.680 --> 24:42.999
WE'RE STILL HEADING EAST.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.945
Toby: I'LL STAY ON HER TAIL.

24:45.980 --> 24:47.675
JUST BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

24:47.720 --> 24:48.914
I LOVE YOU.

24:48.950 --> 24:50.178
( phone beeps )

24:50.220 --> 24:52.518
TOBY SAYS THAT SHANA'S
DRIVING JENNA'S CAR.

24:52.550 --> 24:55.053
IS MONA WITH HER?
NO, NOBODY'S WITH HER.

24:55.090 --> 24:56.284
SO WHERE'S SHE GOING?

24:56.320 --> 24:57.753
HE THOUGHT THAT
THEY WERE COMING HERE,

24:57.790 --> 24:59.257
BUT THEY
JUST PASSED THE EXIT.

24:59.290 --> 25:02.259
GUYS...

25:02.300 --> 25:03.722
IT'S THIS WAY. OVER HERE.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.590
**

25:08.770 --> 25:11.238
( cheering and applause )

25:32.330 --> 25:36.596
WELL, IF "A" WANTED US TO
WATCH HIM MAKE A GIRL DISAPPEAR,
WE'RE RIGHT ON TIME.

25:44.270 --> 25:45.567
( sighs )

25:45.610 --> 25:47.032
I THINK WE'RE BEING WATCHED.

25:47.070 --> 25:48.628
LET'S ALL STICK TOGETHER.

25:53.650 --> 25:56.972
WH-- ME? NO WAY.

25:59.120 --> 26:04.183
( crowd laughs )

26:05.390 --> 26:07.654
Woman: YOU HAVE TO.
Man: YOU CAN'T RESIST.

26:09.260 --> 26:10.796
Crowd: AW.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.127
REALLY, I JUST DON'T DO BOXES.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.788
HERE, TAKE HER.
SHE LOVES MAGIC.
WHAT?

26:15.840 --> 26:19.731
( crowd laughs )

26:19.770 --> 26:24.070
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING AWAY.
I KNOW THIS TRICK.
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

26:24.110 --> 26:29.070
( cheering and applause )

26:29.120 --> 26:32.647
Woman: GOOD JOB! WHOO!

26:39.830 --> 26:42.719
Woman: BYE.
Man: LATER.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.358
WAIT, WHERE'D SHE GO?

26:50.400 --> 26:51.936
JUST WAIT A SECOND.

26:51.970 --> 26:54.973
( cheering and applause )

27:02.420 --> 27:07.687
( cheering and applause )

27:11.090 --> 27:12.648
( crowd laughs )

27:17.160 --> 27:21.130
( cheering and applause )

27:21.170 --> 27:22.398
Man: THAT WAS GREAT!

27:22.440 --> 27:26.103
( cheering and applause )

27:28.040 --> 27:29.302
WHERE'S EMILY?

27:31.450 --> 27:36.376
( all phones chime )

27:39.920 --> 27:41.148
"LAGER DEE MAIN"?

27:41.190 --> 27:43.249
LAGER DEE MAIN.
"SLIGHT OF HAND."

27:55.870 --> 27:56.199
( phone rings )

27:58.470 --> 28:01.303
( gasps )

28:01.340 --> 28:02.375
EMILY, ARE YOU THERE?

28:02.410 --> 28:03.377
ARIA?

28:03.410 --> 28:04.741
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:04.780 --> 28:06.998
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM!

28:07.050 --> 28:08.779
LOOK AROUND YOU.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

28:08.820 --> 28:10.071
NOTHING! IT'S DARK!

28:10.120 --> 28:11.439
WE'RE GONNA FIND YOU,
I PROMISE.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.311
YOU JUST HAVE
TO HELP US OUT.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.249
I THINK I'M LOCKED IN A COFFIN!

28:19.890 --> 28:22.393
( saw buzzing )

28:22.430 --> 28:24.898
IT'S A SAW! I HEAR A SAW!

28:24.930 --> 28:26.397
LIKE A CHAINSAW?

28:26.430 --> 28:28.898
NO! IT'S BIG AND LOUD!
IT'S CUTTING WOOD!

28:28.940 --> 28:31.033
LIKE A SAW MILL?

28:31.070 --> 28:33.038
IT'S GETTING LOUDER! CLOSER!

28:33.070 --> 28:35.868
GRUNWALD LIVED ON
SAW MILL ROAD.

28:35.910 --> 28:37.207
( phone beeping )

28:37.240 --> 28:39.470
OH, MY GOD. IT'S RIGHT HERE.

28:39.510 --> 28:40.875
WE'RE PRACTICALLY ON TOP OF IT.

28:52.460 --> 28:54.428
( saw buzzing )

28:54.460 --> 28:57.156
EMILY? EMILY!

28:57.200 --> 28:59.896
I'M HERE! I'M HERE!

28:59.930 --> 29:01.192
OH, MY GOD!

29:01.240 --> 29:02.366
GUYS, I'M IN HERE!
EMILY!

29:05.010 --> 29:08.878
IT'S LOCKED! IT'S LOCKED!
GO! GO GET SOMETHING! HURRY!

29:10.510 --> 29:11.772
OH, MY GOD!

29:12.950 --> 29:14.315
HOLD ON!
GET ME OUT!

29:15.550 --> 29:19.008
HURRY! HURRY! HOLD ON, EM!

29:20.020 --> 29:21.282
GUYS, GET ME OUT!

29:21.320 --> 29:24.084
COME ON, HURRY!
OH, MY GOD!

29:25.090 --> 29:27.058
(crying )

29:29.160 --> 29:31.822
OH, MY GOD! HURRY UP!

29:34.900 --> 29:35.969
THERE WE GO!

29:37.270 --> 29:39.033
( exhales deeply )

29:44.180 --> 29:46.045
THERE ARE TWO OF THEM?

29:50.920 --> 29:53.013
Emily: NO! JUST LET ME OUT!

29:53.050 --> 29:56.451
EMILY, IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE SAFE.
I'M GETTING YOU OUT.

29:56.490 --> 29:59.425
( gasping ) OH, GOD!

30:14.540 --> 30:17.976
( panting )

30:19.080 --> 30:23.073
( grunting )

30:29.990 --> 30:31.355
( groans )

30:31.390 --> 30:32.982
GIVE IT UP, CeCe!

30:33.030 --> 30:35.851
( grunting )

30:41.170 --> 30:44.207
( gasping )

30:44.240 --> 30:46.060
( screams )

30:46.110 --> 30:48.203
HELP ME! HELP ME!
HOLD ON!

30:48.240 --> 30:49.935
HOLD ON, CeCe! HOLD ON!
ARIA!

30:49.980 --> 30:51.470
HOLD ON!

30:51.510 --> 30:52.477
( grunting )

30:52.510 --> 30:55.070
ARIA, HELP!

30:55.120 --> 30:56.109
( cloth ripping )

30:58.350 --> 30:59.612
( screams )

30:59.650 --> 31:01.117
(thud )

31:01.160 --> 31:03.014
( gasping )

31:19.010 --> 31:20.932
( sighs )

31:20.980 --> 31:23.403
IS SHE...?

31:25.150 --> 31:28.608
SHE FELL.

31:28.650 --> 31:31.346
YOU TRIED TO SAVE HER.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.449
LOOK, ARIA,
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

31:33.490 --> 31:37.950
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY, ARIA?
DID SHE HURT YOU?

31:37.990 --> 31:40.129
WE SHOULD JUST CALL THE POLICE.

31:44.300 --> 31:45.665
SHE'S GONE.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.601
GOD, THAT BITCH HAS NINE LIVES.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.074
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE. NOW.

31:57.110 --> 31:59.078
I HAVE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
COME ON.

31:59.110 --> 32:00.372
COME ON!

32:03.620 --> 32:07.078
I THINK THAT THE RED COAT
THAT I WAS CHASING
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALI.

32:07.120 --> 32:11.250
SHE WAITED FOR ME AT THE DOOR,
AT THE CORNER. SHE WANTED ME
TO FOLLOW HER.

32:13.160 --> 32:16.152
AND THIS IS WHAT
ALI WANTED US TO SEE.

32:23.770 --> 32:25.101
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

32:25.140 --> 32:27.563
I THINK IT'S "A's" LAIR.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.583
Spencer: THERE'S A TIMELINE
FOR EACH OF US.

32:43.620 --> 32:46.589
ALL OUR SECRETS,
PRIVATE MOMENTS--

32:46.630 --> 32:48.951
HE'S DOCUMENTING EVERYTHING.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.508
WHAT IS THAT?

33:05.550 --> 33:08.644
Spencer: THAT'S HOW "A"
HAS BEEN WATCHING US.

33:08.680 --> 33:14.152
"A" IS MONITORING THE POLICE,
WATCHING THE STREETS,
OUR ALARM SYSTEMS.

33:18.390 --> 33:21.496
Spencer:
THAT'S HOW "A" IS EVERYWHERE.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.370
YOU SURE
SHE'S OKAY WITH THIS?

33:41.420 --> 33:43.274
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.246
HAVE A SEAT.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.390
( typing )

33:54.430 --> 33:55.397
( beeps )

33:55.430 --> 33:56.658
( typing )

33:56.700 --> 33:58.122
( beeps )

33:58.170 --> 34:00.627
( typing )

34:00.670 --> 34:01.659
( beeps )

34:01.700 --> 34:02.928
CALEB, IT'S NOT WORKING.

34:02.970 --> 34:04.562
DID YOU HIT SHIFT-COMMAND
WHEN YOU ENTERED THE NUMBERS?

34:04.610 --> 34:06.498
I DID EXACTLY WHAT
YOU TOLD ME TO DO.

34:06.540 --> 34:09.100
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF YOU GUYS BEING THERE ALONE.

34:09.140 --> 34:11.279
AND I CAN'T GET INTO
THAT COMPUTER FROM HERE.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.107
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA SAY
DON'T COME.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.368
I'M NOT WAITING FOR TOBY.
HE'S STILL AT THE HOTEL.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.741
MONA MIGHT BE SAFE,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
SHE'S NOT IN ON THIS.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.213
SO WHEN WILL I SEE YOU?

34:21.520 --> 34:23.215
I'LL GET ON THE NEXT BUS.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.251
I THINK I JUST FOUND
"A's" BANK ACCOUNT.

34:25.290 --> 34:28.293
ALL RIGHT, WELL, JUST CALL ME
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE ROAD, OKAY?

34:28.330 --> 34:29.399
OKAY.
BYE.

34:29.430 --> 34:31.398
IT LOOKS LIKE "A"
FORMED A CORPORATION.

34:31.430 --> 34:34.536
DIDN'T CeCe
STUDY BUSINESS AT UPENN?

34:34.570 --> 34:37.334
YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK
THIS IS HERS.

34:37.370 --> 34:39.565
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S
JUST ON THE PAYROLL.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.532
THERE ARE TWO PAYMENTS
MADE TO CeCe DRAKE LAST WEEK.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.536
MAYBE "A" PAID HER
TO DRESS UP AS RED COAT.

34:43.580 --> 34:45.275
YEAH, TO LEAD US AWAY
FROM ALI.

34:49.850 --> 34:51.215
I THINK "A" IS A GUY.

35:00.230 --> 35:01.595
HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THESE?

35:06.670 --> 35:09.594
WAIT, I WAS WITH ALI
WHEN SHE BOUGHT THAT SHIRT.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.733
SHE SAID SHE NEEDED IT
FOR A DATE THAT NIGHT
WITH AN OLDER GUY.

35:11.770 --> 35:12.702
MAYBE IAN?

35:12.740 --> 35:15.231
OR WREN. HE'S BEEN
HANGING OUT WITH SHANA,

35:15.280 --> 35:17.737
AND HE'S BACK WITH MELISSA.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.643
NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT WREN'S "A."

35:22.380 --> 35:24.348
'CAUSE "A" HAS BEEN
WATCHING HIM. LOOK.

35:24.390 --> 35:27.143
WELL, I STILL THINK
THAT ALL ROADS LEAD BACK
TO BOARD SHORTS.

35:27.190 --> 35:28.680
I MEAN, THE NAME
OF THE COMPANY IS HIGBEE,

35:28.720 --> 35:30.813
AND THAT WAS ALI'S
FAVORITE BEACH IN CAPE MAY.

35:30.860 --> 35:33.829
DO YOU THINK THAT
BOARD SHORTS IS THE ONE
WHO'S TAKING THESE PICTURES?

35:33.860 --> 35:35.498
IS THAT WHO CeCe'S WORKING FOR?

35:43.800 --> 35:46.906
Emily: LOOK, THIS IS
A LETTER FROM ALI.

35:46.940 --> 35:49.374
SHE MET THIS BOY IN ROSEWOOD.

35:49.410 --> 35:52.379
AND SHE LIED ABOUT HER AGE.
HE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS 18.

35:52.410 --> 35:55.777
THAT TRIP TO THE SHORE
MRS. D. TOLD HANNA ABOUT...

35:55.820 --> 35:59.688
ALI NEVER
PLANNED ON INVITING US.
SHE WAS TAKING HIM THERE.

36:00.690 --> 36:01.759
GUYS...

36:03.220 --> 36:04.721
"A" HASN'T JUST
BEEN WATCHING US.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.558
I THINK THAT HE'S
BEEN FOLLOWING ALI, TOO.

36:10.660 --> 36:12.628
HE HAS HER AT THE LODGE
THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE.

36:12.670 --> 36:17.164
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S
BEEN FOLLOWING HER TRAIL
TO RAVENSWOOD.

36:19.810 --> 36:21.505
IF ALI'S BEEN ALIVE
THIS WHOLE TIME,

36:21.540 --> 36:23.303
THEN WHOSE FUNERAL
DID WE GO TO?

36:27.310 --> 36:28.709
OKAY, THAT'S CREEPY.

36:31.250 --> 36:33.343
HANNA: THEY'RE HAVING
A CELEBRATION TONIGHT.

36:33.390 --> 36:35.779
YEAH, AND BOARD SHORTS THINKS
THAT ALI IS GONNA BE THERE.

36:40.630 --> 36:42.791
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE
TO FIND HER FIRST.

36:51.970 --> 36:56.600
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT
FOR A PARTY, BUT IT'S
FOR INVITED GUESTS ONLY.

36:57.980 --> 36:59.470
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT
WE WERE GOING TO--

36:59.510 --> 37:01.319
I'M MRS. GRUNWALD.

37:01.350 --> 37:02.772
WE HAVE SOMEWHERE
WE NEED TO BE.

37:02.820 --> 37:03.809
I KNOW.

37:03.850 --> 37:07.308
BUT IT'S DANGEROUS FOR YOU
TO GO CHASING AFTER HER.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.287
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ALISON?

37:14.900 --> 37:16.322
THE GIRL YOU SAID
YOU NEVER MET.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.863
I'M SORRY I LIED TO YOU.

37:18.900 --> 37:20.868
BUT I DID IT TO PROTECT HER.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.367
FROM WHO?

37:25.340 --> 37:27.638
SHE WAS CALLING ME
THAT SUMMER TO FIND OUT.

37:27.670 --> 37:29.501
IN THE SORORITY HOUSE.

37:29.540 --> 37:30.632
IT WAS YOU.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.568
SHE WAS AFRAID.

37:33.910 --> 37:35.639
AND SHE WAS RIGHT TO BE.

37:37.350 --> 37:39.580
WHAT KIND OF HELP
COULD YOU GIVE HER?

37:41.820 --> 37:45.779
I HAVE A GIFT OF INSIGHT.

37:45.830 --> 37:51.894
I WAS USING IT TO HELP ALISON
SEE WHO WAS THREATENING HER.

37:51.930 --> 37:54.797
THE NIGHT SHE WENT MISSING...

37:56.800 --> 37:59.030
I FELT SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.503
( thunder crashes )

38:00.540 --> 38:02.804
Mrs. Grunwald:
I DROVE TO ROSEWOOD....

38:02.840 --> 38:04.740
AND I WALKED
INTO HER BACKYARD.

38:13.420 --> 38:16.082
AND SHE WAS REACHING FOR LIFE.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.951
( thunder crashes )

38:27.830 --> 38:29.832
HER HEAD WAS BLOODY.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.829
SHE WAS VERY CONFUSED.
SHE WAS IN SHOCK.

38:38.010 --> 38:39.705
I PUT HER IN THE CAR
AND I DROVE HER TO THE HOSPITAL.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.594
I RAN IN TO GET HELP.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.398
WHEN I RETURNED,
SHE WAS GONE.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.464
( sighs )

39:08.810 --> 39:12.701
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT
ALI'S STILL ALIVE?

39:12.750 --> 39:15.116
HAVEN'T YOU ALL FELT IT?

39:16.880 --> 39:20.043
SHE WAS NEVER REALLY GONE.

39:21.590 --> 39:22.852
HAVE YOU SEEN HER AGAIN?

39:22.890 --> 39:26.382
SEEN HER? NOT SINCE THAT NIGHT.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.851
UNTIL SHE FINDS
WHO SHE CAN TRUST--

39:29.900 --> 39:30.992
SHE CAN TRUST US.

39:31.030 --> 39:32.725
SHE KNOWS THAT.

39:32.770 --> 39:34.897
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

39:38.470 --> 39:39.835
( sighs )

39:39.870 --> 39:42.668
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST GO TO THE POLICE?

39:42.710 --> 39:44.507
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE FOUND.

39:45.850 --> 39:48.068
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING US THIS NOW?

39:48.110 --> 39:51.682
BECAUSE YOU NEED
TO LEAVE RAVENSWOOD.

39:52.990 --> 39:55.151
WHY?

39:55.190 --> 39:57.158
YOU'RE BEING WATCHED.

39:57.190 --> 39:59.886
HE'S HOPING YOU'LL
LEAD HIM TO ALISON.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.497
( laughter )

40:05.930 --> 40:07.522
HE'S HERE.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.866
MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE.

40:43.900 --> 40:47.609
SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PACK IT IN
JUST BECAUSE A SOOTHSAYER
TELLS US TO?

40:47.640 --> 40:50.734
I MEAN, FOR ALL WE KNOW,
SHE COULD BE ON "A's" PAYROLL.

40:50.780 --> 40:53.977
SHE CAN'T PROVE THAT
ANY OF THAT STORY WAS TRUE.

40:54.010 --> 40:57.138
ALI WAS CALLING GRUNWALD
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED
THAT SHE COULD HELP HER.

40:57.180 --> 40:59.648
YEAH, I BELIEVE HER, TOO.

40:59.690 --> 41:02.079
SHE WAS TELLING US
WHAT WE'RE THINKING, RIGHT?

41:02.120 --> 41:03.849
THAT ALI'S STILL ALIVE.

41:03.890 --> 41:04.982
NO, THAT'S WHAT
A GOOD CHARLATAN DOES.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.588
SHE TELLS YOU
WHAT YOU WANNA BELIEVE.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.120
MAYBE GRUNWALD
DOESN'T WANT US TO COME TONIGHT

41:08.160 --> 41:09.855
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
THAT ALI WILL BE THERE.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.221
AND "A" IS GONNA BE
LOOKING FOR HER.

41:12.270 --> 41:13.794
( footsteps approaching )

41:20.010 --> 41:21.705
WE'RE CRASHING A PARTY.

42:03.180 --> 42:06.183
( panting )

42:10.290 --> 42:12.281
**

42:21.100 --> 42:23.091
( breathing loudly)
