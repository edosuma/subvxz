Yo, hurry the fuck up.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.106
Boy, it's a half way house, ain't no jail.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.024

01:20.455 --> 01:22.707

01:22.707 --> 01:24.334
- I mean don't ask me.

01:25.376 --> 01:28.213
Besides, better that dad than no dad.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.339
(chuckling)

01:29.339 --> 01:31.049
- I would take no dad.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.011

01:36.054 --> 01:36.888
- I know.

01:41.976 --> 01:42.811

01:42.811 --> 01:43.728
Go ahead and try,

01:43.728 --> 01:45.897
you wouldn't last a day, you little brat.

01:45.897 --> 01:46.689
- Shut up!

01:46.689 --> 01:47.690
Let's go, let's go!

01:48.650 --> 01:51.736
(garbage can thuds)
(girls laughing)

01:51.736 --> 01:54.239
(tense music)

01:58.368 --> 02:01.246
- Hey, ain't it past your bedtime?

02:01.246 --> 02:02.831
What the fuck, there's another one.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.332
- [Boy] Hey, Sarah.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.792
- Danny.

02:05.792 --> 02:06.626
Hi.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.631
- You girls having a good night?

02:11.631 --> 02:13.216
- Ah, Danny?

02:14.134 --> 02:14.968
(Sarah giggles)

02:14.968 --> 02:15.802
Stop it.

02:15.802 --> 02:16.761
- How do you know Sarah?

02:16.761 --> 02:20.473
- Oh, we share breakfast
together most mornings.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.517
- Huh?

02:22.851 --> 02:25.019
- We live together and work together.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.563
- At that Korean grocery store?

02:26.604 --> 02:27.981
- Chinese.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.858
We're spent.
- Yeah (giggles).

02:29.858 --> 02:31.609
Our boss is a dodgy slob

02:31.609 --> 02:33.695
so he gave us this bottle to drink.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.280
- Yeah?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.322
Looks like it worked.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.076
- [Sarah] What do you know?

02:40.160 --> 02:40.994
- Smooth.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.624
(low key music)

02:47.000 --> 02:47.917
I'm just joking.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.754
- Well it's nice to see you.

02:53.006 --> 02:53.840
- Same.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.550
- So how was it?

02:57.844 --> 02:58.720
- I mean, it was all right.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.182
(clears throat)

03:02.599 --> 03:05.602
- Nick, what's up?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.145
- Lin, whatever.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.939
So, who is this?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.987
- [Nick] This is my brother Marko.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.530
- Is he really?

03:17.614 --> 03:19.073
(Marko chuckles)

03:20.033 --> 03:20.867
- Half brother.

03:20.909 --> 03:21.743
- There you go.

03:21.743 --> 03:22.577
- Yeah.

03:23.578 --> 03:27.290
- Anyways, that's my main homie Ryker.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.291
- Hey.

03:29.125 --> 03:29.959
- Poindexter.

03:32.128 --> 03:32.962
- Chris.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.298
- Very saintly.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.552
- Mine is too.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.055
- Yeah I wasn't talking about the name.

03:43.806 --> 03:44.641
- Hmm.

03:45.725 --> 03:46.559
- Hmm.

03:47.685 --> 03:52.690
So Chris, do you wanna come join us?

03:55.777 --> 03:56.611
- Yeah.
- You can invite your friend

03:56.694 --> 03:58.613
but I mean, not really.

04:07.538 --> 04:10.208
(clears throat)

04:23.304 --> 04:25.974
- Whoah whoah, easy there, tiger.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.017
Man, didn't they teach
you anything in juvie?

04:29.686 --> 04:30.937
Actually, where were you?

04:33.147 --> 04:34.065
- I was around.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.651
- I ain't seen you.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.027
- Who'd you room with?

04:40.321 --> 04:42.240
- [Nick] You have a room
to yourself or something?

04:42.532 --> 04:44.158
- I guess so.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.618
- Ain't no I guess so.

04:45.618 --> 04:49.205
Look, you either heard
somebody shit, piss, fart,

04:49.330 --> 04:51.791
I mean fucking beat
one out, or you didn't.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.296
- I did some IT stuff,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.548
so it was like a tradeoff.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.050
- You hear that?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.928
Got the prisons going
all high tech and shit.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.972
Must be in the wrong business.

05:06.556 --> 05:11.519
- All right, anyway, so
this is Marko, Ryker, Chris,

05:11.519 --> 05:14.230
and I already forgot your name.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.315
- Oh my god, you talk a lot.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.234
- I don't mind.
(Lin mumbling)

05:18.234 --> 05:20.194
- You ever drink before, big guy?

05:20.278 --> 05:21.571
- Yeah, all the time.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.739
- Get to it, don't babysit it.

05:28.578 --> 05:29.579
(coughing)

05:29.620 --> 05:30.830
What the fuck, man?

05:30.872 --> 05:33.124
Fuck!
(laughing)

05:33.124 --> 05:34.167
- Okay.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.918
- All right, you know, I think we should

05:36.002 --> 05:37.712
start this one on the kiddy rides.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.546
Come on, man.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.177
- I guess we're going to the playground.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.928
Back in a sec.

05:45.970 --> 05:49.599
- Hey, boys and alcohol
are not a good idea.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.516
We should split.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.310
- Look at him with those idiots.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.937
- Yeah, we don't need them, let's go.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.231
- You're right, we don't, let's go.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.194
- Hey Danny, I think your girl's leaving.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.695
- Hey!

06:03.446 --> 06:04.697
What are you doing?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.700
- We're gonna go throw rocks at a house.

06:08.284 --> 06:09.702
- What, why?

06:11.871 --> 06:12.955
- Why not?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.792
- Wait, we'll come with.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.877
Can a fella get a drink first?

06:19.128 --> 06:20.671
- Okay, fine.

06:20.671 --> 06:23.800
Whatever, but you have until we finish

06:23.841 --> 06:25.426
a quick game of Poor Me.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.972
And since no one's had
a shittier life than me,

06:29.972 --> 06:31.808
I guess I'll be judge.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.060
- Well how do we know that?

06:34.644 --> 06:37.814
- Oh, I would trust her if I were you.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.607
- We need a judge.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.026
- [Sarah] Yeah, so who's gonna go first?

06:42.276 --> 06:43.486
- I'll go first.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.113
Computer crimes, right?

06:45.113 --> 06:45.988
Next!

06:47.740 --> 06:49.826
Actually, you probably
like learn how to cheat

06:49.909 --> 06:52.203
on that like, Forkknife shit huh?

06:52.286 --> 06:53.871
- Something like that.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.457
- Like yo, we don't care.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.668
Look, we was raised in the proper shit.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.212
Y'all thought juvie was bad,

07:01.212 --> 07:03.005
y'all should have been to St. Pauls.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.466
Religion had been left that place.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.260
Cockroaches and rats all on your bed.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.594
- Don't touch me.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.387
(chuckling)

07:09.429 --> 07:10.847
- Don't nobody wanna touch you.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.223
- [Lin] Right.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.142
-Seriously folks,

07:14.183 --> 07:16.352
two half cast brothers like us,

07:16.352 --> 07:18.729
Older boys had a field
day with me and Marko.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.860
Sometimes, feel like I
was in a hospital bed

07:23.860 --> 07:25.069
more than my own.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.237
(somber music)

07:26.237 --> 07:29.699
- Yeah, till everything
shifted and it all changed.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.618
- What shifted?

07:33.119 --> 07:33.953
- You blind?

07:34.370 --> 07:37.248
About a hundred pounds
of pure muscle over here.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.666
(scoffing)

07:38.749 --> 07:40.251
- How did you end up in juvie?

07:40.835 --> 07:41.836
- oh that?

07:43.921 --> 07:46.507
We don't really gotta get into that.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.176
All I could say is,

07:48.176 --> 07:50.219
we was framed for that shit.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.053
(laughing)

07:51.053 --> 07:51.888
- Right.

07:51.888 --> 07:52.722
- Everyone is.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.848
- Okay, what about you?

07:53.848 --> 07:55.725
What were you in for?

07:55.725 --> 07:57.852
- Shit, I got locked up for ice cream.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.813
- Sure, then lock me in for life.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.441
For real, what are you not guilty of?

08:03.441 --> 08:04.775
- Oh, I am guilty.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.527
See the last thing my dad did

08:06.527 --> 08:08.905
before being killed by a
bunch of fucking cowards

08:08.905 --> 08:10.531
was buy me ice cream.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.493
- Shit, I'm sorry.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.994
- Shit, I'm sorry too

08:14.994 --> 08:16.913
specially for the motherfuckers who did it

08:16.913 --> 08:19.248
'cause when I find them,
I'm returning the favor.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.584
- What, dude, no.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.544
- Who else is gonna do it?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.630
Cops aren't interested.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.715
The useless pigs even tried to lock me up

08:27.715 --> 08:29.091
for not leaving the station.

08:31.219 --> 08:32.970
- So what did you do?

08:34.347 --> 08:37.141
- So, just stole a cop car.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.769
- Well what'd you do with it?

08:40.269 --> 08:42.063
- Just gave it back to them.

08:43.064 --> 08:43.898
- What?

08:45.024 --> 08:48.402
- 40 miles per hour straight
through the front doors.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.487
- Fuck.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.821
- Oh my god.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.156
- I don't know if y'all ever seen

08:52.156 --> 08:54.116
a cop car go through the cop station.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.952
But judging by the reaction of
everybody at the front desk,

08:55.952 --> 08:57.995
I say it's not a common occurrence.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.623
(laughs)

09:01.290 --> 09:02.291
Over to you, love.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.919
- Yeah, girls don't tell,

09:04.961 --> 09:07.255
specially on the first date.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.048
- [Ryker] Pssh, Nick wack.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.300
- Right, manners, gentlemen.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.220
We still have yet to hear from Danny boy.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.846
I mean we've all heard it, right?

09:15.846 --> 09:17.265
My mom's a movie star.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.058
I've lived everywhere.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.393
Boo hoo.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.188
- Yeah, I for sure heard that shit.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.316
Ah, my mom does porn
and I was the fluffer.

09:27.441 --> 09:29.485
(laughing)

09:29.569 --> 09:31.821
- All right, my mom never worked porn

09:32.029 --> 09:34.282
and never fluffed anybody but myself,

09:34.407 --> 09:36.450
so fuck you guys.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.786
(laughing)

09:39.579 --> 09:41.414
But she was in movies though.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.541
Mostly crap ones.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.837
So I spent a lot of time on
or traveling to shitty sets.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.505
I never had a real dad.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.010
Just a lot of guys
pretending to be nice to me

09:54.343 --> 09:56.137
so they could get in my mom's pants.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.932
Or not so nice to me so
they could get rid of me

10:00.349 --> 10:02.226
to get in my mom's pants.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.437
Either way, things never lasted.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.397
The end.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.651
- Boo!

10:10.735 --> 10:12.945
Man, why you gotta make
that shit depressing?

10:12.945 --> 10:15.489
- Yeah, poor effort.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.743
Uh, winner, because something tells me

10:18.743 --> 10:20.494
the story we didn't get to hear

10:20.494 --> 10:22.246
was the one we weren't supposed to.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.624
- [Nick] No, no, no,
no, no, man, fuck this.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.209
We just went over this.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.336
- Ah.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.421
- Fuck y'all sitting for, come on!

10:30.421 --> 10:31.505
-Ok, let's do it, you ready?

10:31.505 --> 10:32.965
- Yeah.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.926
(electronic music)

10:38.763 --> 10:40.139
(Marko clears throat)

10:40.139 --> 10:43.434
- One quart of vodka.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.397
Ooh.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.900
- Jesus Christ.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.401
When are we gonna get there?

10:52.443 --> 10:53.027
I gotta take a shit.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.278
- Shut up

11:03.996 --> 11:06.832
- This is it.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.793
- Okay you guys, let's grab some rocks.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.129
- [Nick] Black rock.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.966
I wish there was more leaves.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.430
(tense music)

11:51.168 --> 11:53.337
(slamming)

11:53.671 --> 11:54.505
- What the fuck just happened, guys?

11:54.672 --> 11:55.423
- He's got her!

11:55.423 --> 11:56.841
- [Marko] Fuck yeah, let's go!

11:56.841 --> 11:59.260
(shattering)

12:00.761 --> 12:02.930
- Go, around the side, around the side!

12:04.265 --> 12:05.933
- Oh, so I see you brought
your friends with you

12:05.933 --> 12:07.351
you stupid idiot!

12:16.318 --> 12:22.158
Shit.

12:26.287 --> 12:31.459
Come on!

12:33.169 --> 12:36.297
All right, get out or I'll kill her!

12:36.297 --> 12:38.507
You get the fuck out of here or she dies.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.802
- We're not going anywhere.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.388
-[Nick] shit

12:44.889 --> 12:46.182
- [Old Man] I'm
not joking with you kids.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.894
- God dammit!

12:50.019 --> 12:53.355
- Look.

12:53.355 --> 12:56.066
I swear, come any closer.

12:58.235 --> 13:00.154
(loud clattering)

13:00.154 --> 13:01.113
(Sarah screams)

13:02.323 --> 13:04.366
If you don't stop squirming,
I'm gonna stick you

13:04.366 --> 13:04.950
like a pig!

13:04.950 --> 13:06.410
- You fucking touch her again,

13:06.410 --> 13:09.121
this ends very badly for you.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.790
- I swear to god, I'll kill her.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.125
- She dies, you die.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.503
(Sarah whimpers)

13:16.545 --> 13:20.466
-All right,
all right, tell you what.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.385
You let me get to my car,
let me get to my car.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.137
Let me get to my car.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.263
- No, no you guys, come on.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.097
- And i'll let her go.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.433
- Guys just fucking kill him,
come on you guys, come on.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.101
Don't leave me with him,
don't leave me with him, okay?

13:31.101 --> 13:32.812
- Look, we're only interested in Sarah.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.563
- What do you think I'm and idiot?

13:34.563 --> 13:36.690
- Come on. Don't leave me with him.
Come on you guys.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.943
(groaning)

13:38.943 --> 13:40.569
(sighing)

13:49.203 --> 13:51.997
- (sighs) Oh. Oh no.

13:53.040 --> 13:53.958
What'd you do?

13:54.041 --> 13:54.875
- Calm down.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.502
- No, no, no, we don't owe her shit!

13:56.502 --> 13:57.503
-Shut-

13:57.878 --> 14:00.297
- It's gonna be okay, man, calm down.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.509
- What'd you do to us?

14:04.593 --> 14:05.970
- What did I do?

14:05.970 --> 14:07.179
What did he do?

14:10.099 --> 14:11.183
- [Nick] Holy shit, computer boy.

14:14.311 --> 14:16.814
(tense music)

14:27.366 --> 14:28.868
- [Ryker] Hey, come on guys.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.452
Let's go.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.830
[Nick] Come on. Come on

14:32.830 --> 14:34.248
[Nick] Yo yo. Come on, come on.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.082
Come on, come on.

14:35.124 --> 14:35.958
- Let me!

14:36.709 --> 14:38.043
- [Danny] Guys, stop.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.170
We need to work this out.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.089
- [Nick] Oh since when
are you the leader, huh?

14:43.007 --> 14:44.216
- [Danny] We need a plan.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.384
- Oh we already got one.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.594
One foot in front of the other, fast.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.304
- [Danny] No, it has
to be better than that.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.180
- The police are gonna think
we broke in this man's house

14:50.222 --> 14:51.265
and killed him!

14:51.307 --> 14:52.057
(coughing)

14:52.057 --> 14:52.892
Ah, fuck!

14:53.267 --> 14:55.019
- [Danny] He's not dead yet.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.812
- [Ryker] We're going to jail for life!

14:56.812 --> 14:58.272
- [Marko] Don't look at me,
   

14:58.272 --> 14:58.689
- [Chris] What did I do?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.024
- Yo, your fucking computer
is not gonna get us

15:00.024 --> 15:01.066
out of this one now, is it?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.109
- Yes, so we gotta go now.
- Oh my god, no.

15:02.109 --> 15:05.112
(shouting over each other)

15:05.112 --> 15:06.363
There's a dead body there.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.489
We need to go!

15:07.781 --> 15:09.408
(shouting over each other)

15:09.867 --> 15:10.409
-No!

15:10.409 --> 15:11.035
We have to go.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.036
-No we can't

15:12.077 --> 15:13.037
Thats my best friend you're talking about

15:14.413 --> 15:15.831
[Nick] Fucking, stay with her than!

15:18.000 --> 15:18.834
(old man shouting)

15:18.834 --> 15:19.919
-Fuck?

15:20.169 --> 15:21.003
Wait, wait, wait.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.087
That means he was alive.

15:22.087 --> 15:22.922
Marko, you're in the clear.

15:22.922 --> 15:23.756
Come on, we're fucking going.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.674
- You guys get out of here.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.680
- Yeah, look, the police are
gonna believe her, all right?

15:31.680 --> 15:34.725
She just shishkebabbed
that asshole, let's go!

15:35.100 --> 15:36.560
- This shit's out of control!

15:48.989 --> 15:50.449
- [Danny] Why, Sarah?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.201
- He was about to rape me.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.331
- But we stopped him?

15:58.082 --> 15:59.458
- Did you?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.044
Did you, because I don't
remember you being here

16:02.127 --> 16:04.296
when I was passed around by pedophiles.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.177
I can't have kids because
of what this sick bastard

16:10.177 --> 16:12.012
and his perverted friends did to me.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.560
(gasping)

16:25.317 --> 16:26.652
- I'll take care of you.

16:27.987 --> 16:28.946
I promise.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.911
(somber music)

16:39.039 --> 16:41.917
If we leave, he dies.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.253
None of us can escape the blame.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.006
- My bad, I don't know if I heard you.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.298
Uh, us?

16:48.298 --> 16:49.633
What are you talking about, boy?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.135
I didn't even touch him.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.430
- If he dies, you're
an accessory to murder.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.931
No question.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.975
- Are you suggesting
that we leave Sarah here?

16:58.225 --> 16:59.309
- Yeah, fuck her!

16:59.309 --> 17:00.602
- [Lin] You can't do that.

17:00.602 --> 17:01.437
- We won't.

17:02.438 --> 17:06.775
But we came in here to
attack and we've got priors.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.403
- I only came to attack the house.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.031
- Well that's not how it
worked out, is it now,

17:12.031 --> 17:13.282
Edward goddamn scissorhands!

17:13.282 --> 17:14.575
- Look!

17:14.616 --> 17:15.826
If we call it in,

17:15.826 --> 17:17.870
then it's a dying man's word against ours.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.121
And we're fucked.

17:19.121 --> 17:23.167
If we don't, he's as good
as dead and we're fucked.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.961
- We should cut, all right?

17:25.961 --> 17:27.838
- We can't just run forever.

17:27.838 --> 17:31.050
I mean people are gonna
notice seven kids missing.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.094
- Those dumb motherfuckers won't catch me.

17:34.511 --> 17:39.141
- No job, no bank account, no future.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.270
- Look.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.105
We don't leave right now,
we're going down regardless

17:45.147 --> 17:46.774
so you getting to a point or not?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.365
- We shouldn't just leave
them out in the open.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.408
- Fuck them!

17:56.408 --> 17:58.327
- And him, and him.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.120
- Oh my god.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.915
All right, what you getting up at?

18:08.504 --> 18:09.338
- One in.

18:12.549 --> 18:13.383
All in.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.218
- [Nick] No, no, no, no, look.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.385
That's your fucking plan, all right?

18:15.385 --> 18:17.096
We are leaving.

18:17.096 --> 18:17.846
Come on.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.937
So we all just stab him?

18:24.937 --> 18:25.771
- Man, I already did.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.859
- Look, I'm not going down for you,

18:30.859 --> 18:31.610
your fucking girlfriend,

18:31.693 --> 18:33.570
or Mr. Arts and Crafts
over here, all right?

18:33.570 --> 18:35.322
- What about me, huh?

18:35.322 --> 18:36.573
- Look, there's no way
that little butter knife

18:36.615 --> 18:37.449
did that much damage.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.784
Look at the shit in him now!

18:46.500 --> 18:47.334
Fucking shit.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.002
Alright, stab the fucking pedophile.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.254
- You've lost your damn mind!

18:50.254 --> 18:51.672
- What are you doing?

18:51.672 --> 18:55.008
This is crazy, I'm not stabbing anyone.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.136
- It's okay, you don't have to.

18:57.678 --> 19:01.807
- Lin, if you don't,
you have to stay away.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.561
- But I don't have anyone else.

19:14.736 --> 19:15.863
This isn't fair.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.158
This is not my fault.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.243
I'm not stabbing anyone.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.661
I can't--
- [Sarah] Lin, I'm sorry!

19:22.703 --> 19:23.662
I'm sorry, Lin.

19:27.499 --> 19:31.086
- Hey look, man, you got
your shit, I got mine.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.379
- [Nick] Yeah, it's all good.

19:38.886 --> 19:42.890
(sighing) Batter up, Danny boy.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.440
(hands being washed)

20:00.032 --> 20:00.866
- Hey.

20:02.034 --> 20:02.868
Come with me.

20:10.125 --> 20:10.959
- Danny.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.379
You don't have to do this.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.799
You don't have to do this.

20:17.799 --> 20:19.968
You don't have to do this.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.099
(knife enters body)

20:32.189 --> 20:33.690
- All right.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.525
That was fun.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.610
Um.So can we go now?

20:38.946 --> 20:40.614
- So what are we gonna do about this?

20:42.991 --> 20:44.117
- It's not gonna clean.

20:46.536 --> 20:47.371
Nothing is.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.875
We've only got one shot.

20:51.875 --> 20:52.668
- What?

20:54.711 --> 20:56.672
- Let's burn this motherfucker down.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.465
- Yeah, yeah.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.634
- And this kiddie fucker with it.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.887
- I know where the matches are.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.056
Whoah, shit.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.440
(ripping)

21:33.208 --> 21:35.961
I thought we were just stabbing him.

21:35.961 --> 21:36.795
- Fuck you.

21:42.009 --> 21:42.843
- Oh shit.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.929
- It's Molly, it's Molly, it's Molly.

21:45.929 --> 21:46.847
Let me talk to her.

21:46.847 --> 21:47.764
- What, no!

21:49.808 --> 21:50.642
Sarah!

21:50.642 --> 21:53.395
- Please tell him don't hurt her.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.191
(muffled scream )

21:58.942 --> 22:00.569
- It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.862
-Fraaank!

22:01.862 --> 22:03.780
-We have to, we have to.

22:04.531 --> 22:07.826
You'll be uncomfortable but you're safe.

22:07.909 --> 22:08.618
-why? (muffled)

22:08.869 --> 22:09.911
-You're not in danger.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.748
- I'm sorry, Molly.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.008
- What are we gonna do with the old lady?

22:23.091 --> 22:24.343
- Got it.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.469
I say we go two for two
and we could kill her too.

22:25.552 --> 22:26.595
What do you guys think--

22:26.595 --> 22:27.721
- What, no!

22:27.721 --> 22:30.015
(laughing)

22:30.015 --> 22:32.017
- Who are we, the Manson family?

22:32.017 --> 22:33.810
No more killing!

22:33.810 --> 22:35.604
End of story.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.772
- She knows Sarah, all right?

22:37.105 --> 22:38.982
And you know she knows her too!

22:38.982 --> 22:40.233
- Yeah, you up for it?

22:41.985 --> 22:44.696
- I already did my part.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.782
- [Marko] Come on.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.748
- This has gone real bad.

22:57.042 --> 23:00.504
Did Molly play any part in the abuse?

23:00.504 --> 23:01.463
- What, no.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.214
- Was she ever in the room?

23:02.214 --> 23:03.590
- No, no.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.550
She only ever loved me.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.304
(Molly whimpering)

23:10.847 --> 23:13.016
- Hey, I'm sorry to break up this whole

23:13.016 --> 23:14.601
romantic tension you guys got going on

23:14.601 --> 23:16.520
but somebody better go check up on her.

23:18.146 --> 23:19.564
(sobbing)

23:19.564 --> 23:22.317
- I didn't know, I didn't know.

23:22.317 --> 23:23.902
- He can't hurt us anymore.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.573
- How can you ever forgive me?

23:28.573 --> 23:30.075
- It's okay, I'm okay.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.662
- But I failed you.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.791
-Did you know your husband was having sex

23:37.791 --> 23:38.667
with little girls?

23:39.376 --> 23:40.585
- Never!

23:40.585 --> 23:42.170
I would have killed him.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.422
I would have...

23:45.507 --> 23:46.842
-Do you know why we're here?

23:50.095 --> 23:51.555
Frank is dead.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.477
(somber music)

24:00.021 --> 24:00.856
- Oh.

24:01.773 --> 24:02.607
Oh god.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.568
Frank did this?

24:05.277 --> 24:06.111
Oh god.

24:08.155 --> 24:08.989
Oh my god.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.078
Oh honey.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.455
I've ruined your life.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.583
- No, you didn't ruin
anything, you didn't.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.042
- I'm sorry.
- No.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.092
- So what do you need?

24:30.886 --> 24:31.845
- We're in trouble.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.600
Get something to cut her free with.

24:38.852 --> 24:39.769
- [Nick] SIghs. Look at what you're sitting on genius.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.063
- Wait, so we're just gonna let her go?

24:48.695 --> 24:50.197
- Molly's gonna take the blame

24:51.156 --> 24:53.283
for accidentally murdering Frank.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.869
- What, no, no, no,
she didn't do anything,

24:55.869 --> 24:56.703
this isn't her fault!

24:56.870 --> 24:57.704
- [Nick] Sarah.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.623
It's you or her.

24:59.748 --> 25:00.790
-No

25:01.166 --> 25:02.000
- Hey.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.001
It's me.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.134
- All right.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.553
Everybody get washed and changed.

25:13.553 --> 25:16.139
Anything with blood,
just make a pile, okay?

25:17.557 --> 25:20.685
Nick, try to find us some new
clothes or something to wear.

25:21.645 --> 25:22.854
- I'm not your fucking servant.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.317
- Fine, I'll do it.

25:31.404 --> 25:32.656
- Are you ready for this?

25:53.051 --> 25:54.219
Hey, hey, hey.

25:56.096 --> 25:56.888
It's all right.

25:56.888 --> 25:57.722
You okay?

26:03.728 --> 26:05.146
- What do you need me to do?

26:06.565 --> 26:09.985
- You have to pretend
that Frank's beating you.

26:11.444 --> 26:13.029
- But how am I gonna do that?

26:15.198 --> 26:16.032
Please.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.369
- However he normally does.

26:22.122 --> 26:27.127
Scream, break windows,
break bones if need be.

26:28.545 --> 26:32.382
The police have to believe
that you murdered your husband.

26:33.633 --> 26:35.135
in self-defense.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.475
We don't have a backup plan, Molly.

26:47.397 --> 26:48.231
You're it.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.320
- You tell Sarah that I love her.

back to St. Paul's.

34:18.931 --> 34:22.685
We got a special orphanage
for the likes of you.

- Then why do you care?

34:41.245 --> 34:43.498
(slamming)

Shit, oh my god.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.052

an angel outside the church?

34:56.052 --> 34:56.886
That's so good.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.096
- [Ryker] Nick, come on!

34:58.096 --> 35:02.975
- Next time gorgeous

35:13.986 --> 35:15.655
- Looks like you had a breakout.

35:16.531 --> 35:17.365
- Was it yours?

35:18.241 --> 35:19.826
- No.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.160
Ooh, this one's mine!

35:22.954 --> 35:23.788
Oh.

35:27.583 --> 35:28.417
Okay.

35:37.426 --> 35:39.679
- Nice to finally see you again?

35:39.679 --> 35:41.514
- We've been over this already.

35:41.514 --> 35:44.517
You know the paparazzi are
always stalking out these places.

35:47.895 --> 35:49.397
- Sweet ride.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.524
- And its owner treats me very well.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.484
- You got married again?

35:53.484 --> 35:55.069
- No, not yet anyways.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.489
You know, it's no picnic
out there, you know?

35:58.489 --> 36:00.032
Specially of ladies of a certain age

36:00.032 --> 36:01.159
with extra baggage.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.869
- Oh, thanks mom.

36:02.869 --> 36:03.995
- You know what I mean.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.247
- Little bit better than
your six by eight cell.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.170
No fraternizing with ex-cons.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.755
Be clean, find a job and
we'll get along just fine.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.301
Well we'd love to stay and chat

36:18.301 --> 36:19.969
but we have an engagement to attend.

36:19.969 --> 36:23.222
Food's in the fridge,
here's a little play money.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.807
- Oh gee, thanks.

36:24.807 --> 36:25.766
- [Man] Do you ski?

36:27.101 --> 36:28.895
- Never really tried it.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.606
- Perfect, the mountain's
too dangerous for rookies.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.025
- Well, you don't like the cold, do you?

36:34.025 --> 36:35.610
- Does anyone?

36:35.610 --> 36:39.030
- No, I just remember you
crying when you were younger.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.156
- Yeah, thanks.

36:40.156 --> 36:40.990
- No, it's okay.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.742
I just wanted you to understand
why we didn't book you

36:42.742 --> 36:44.785
on the Aspen trip.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.120
- Hot tub holds only two.

36:47.580 --> 36:48.915
But besides, you'll be fine.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.625
Pete'll take care of you.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.584
- The doorman?

36:51.584 --> 36:53.461
- [Man] Yeah, he's like family.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.721
(phone ringing)

37:03.721 --> 37:04.764
- I'll get it.

37:04.931 --> 37:05.765
- I'll get it.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.063
- Hi.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.565
This is Danny, is Chris in?

37:14.565 --> 37:16.525
- How do you know Chris?

37:16.525 --> 37:17.860
- From chess club.

37:18.819 --> 37:21.197
- Oh great, I'll get him for you then.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.951
Chris, it's Danny.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.285
- I can take it from here.

37:29.455 --> 37:30.915
Hey, Danny.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.083
- Hey, Chris.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.835
- I would love you to,
but let me just check.

37:36.754 --> 37:40.341
Mom, can Danny come over
for a game of chess?

37:40.341 --> 37:42.468
- I can't play chess,
you know that, right?

37:42.468 --> 37:43.761
- That's fine.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.388
I look forward to meeting him.

37:45.388 --> 37:46.555
- Perfect.

37:46.555 --> 37:47.765
See you at one.

37:47.765 --> 37:48.599
- What?

37:57.525 --> 37:58.442
(knocking)

37:58.442 --> 37:59.277
- I'll get it.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.987
- Relax, Chris, it's my house.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.029
I'll answer the door.

38:05.658 --> 38:06.659
Danny?

38:06.659 --> 38:07.576
- Yes, ma'am.

38:07.576 --> 38:08.494
- [Mom] Do come in.

38:08.494 --> 38:09.912
- Oh no please, after you.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.919
- So you're Chris's new friend.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.672
- Oh, actually, Miss Hamilton,

38:19.964 --> 38:22.300
I've known Chris in the chess circles

38:22.300 --> 38:24.218
for quite a while now.

38:24.218 --> 38:26.178
- Oh chess, yes, I remember, I remember.

38:26.178 --> 38:29.181
- Yeah but I haven't seen him in ages.

38:29.181 --> 38:30.891
I really miss our heated battles

38:30.891 --> 38:34.103
over the 64 square pantheon.

38:36.272 --> 38:38.149
Knight to King four, buddy.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.025
Where you been?

38:39.025 --> 38:41.527
- We had to move for
Chris's father's work.

38:41.527 --> 38:42.611
But we're back.

38:42.611 --> 38:45.114
And please, please, call me Diarn.

38:46.365 --> 38:51.370
- I've got the pantheon
all ready upstairs.

38:51.537 --> 38:52.580
After you, man.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.180
That was great.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.389
- Yeah, you like that?

39:10.514 --> 39:11.515
- You turned her from interrogator

39:11.515 --> 39:14.393
into liar liar pants
on fire in two seconds.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.523
Have any trouble finding the place?

39:19.523 --> 39:20.358
- Nah.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.526
Except it took me over
an hour to get here.

39:23.652 --> 39:25.237
- Sorry.

39:25.279 --> 39:27.490
- Don't ever apologize for where you live.

39:27.782 --> 39:28.991
Especially not to me.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.162
What's this?

39:33.204 --> 39:35.164
- This is Amish HQ.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.168
The remains of my computer.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.922
My remote control car.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.385
They've even taken the
batteries out of the remote.

39:48.886 --> 39:52.098
You've gotta get out of
the chair to change the TV.

39:52.139 --> 39:53.015
Crazy shit!

39:55.017 --> 39:58.312
I need an internet fix, something bad.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.315
But I'm under house arrest.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.192
- Mm, brutal.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.528
- You keep that little
prince charming show going

40:05.528 --> 40:08.030
and I'll be allowed out soon enough.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.782
(chuckling)

40:09.782 --> 40:11.826
- Right, now you better explain this shit.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.125
What the hell is he doing here?

40:19.125 --> 40:20.876
- [Sarah] I'm sure there's a good reason.

40:21.001 --> 40:22.002
-Wait a second I gotta go hang a piss

40:23.546 --> 40:24.380
- Wait here.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.019
- Hey.

40:39.019 --> 40:40.020
- Deal's off.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.398
Every man for themselves.

40:42.398 --> 40:43.232
- Whoah, whoah, let me explain.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.733
- [Danny] You got two seconds.

40:44.733 --> 40:45.568
- Here?

40:45.568 --> 40:46.652
- One second.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.781
- Look, we almost Frankied another man.

40:50.781 --> 40:51.615
Ryker included.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.912
- What, you boys mercenaries now?

40:56.912 --> 40:58.414
- Hardly.

40:58.414 --> 41:01.208
We're in hiding at Ryker's uncle's place.

41:01.208 --> 41:03.961
You leave me alone with those
two, I'm gonna kill 'em.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.045
- You're responsible.

41:08.382 --> 41:09.216
- Okay.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.679
- Wash your hands.

41:13.679 --> 41:15.097
- Why, it's my cock.

41:16.765 --> 41:18.559
- You get more germs from this door,

41:20.227 --> 41:21.145
- Than my cock.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.323
[Marko] Yo hey!

41:34.783 --> 41:36.327
You guys look cute and all but

41:36.327 --> 41:38.037
what are you wandering around for?

41:38.037 --> 41:39.371
- He wanted to see the ducks.

41:42.541 --> 41:43.375
- Okay.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.086
- Where's Poindexter?

41:46.086 --> 41:47.922
- That's our first order of business.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.467
- Better have a good excuse.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.968
- Find somewhere else to talk.

42:02.478 --> 42:05.064
- So, I think we'd all like
to know what happened

42:05.064 --> 42:06.273
to our little IT friend.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.193
- Right.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.779
I thought it'd be best
if we talked about stuff

42:11.779 --> 42:14.156
concerning Chris while he's not here.

42:14.156 --> 42:16.367
- What kind of stuff?

42:16.367 --> 42:17.952
- We should leave him out.

42:17.952 --> 42:18.786
- I disagree.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.747
- Didn't see that coming.

42:21.747 --> 42:22.581
- Look, when are you gonna get it,

42:22.581 --> 42:25.125
you're not making the
fucking calls, all right?

42:25.125 --> 42:27.836
- Okay, stop.

42:27.836 --> 42:29.505
Why don't you explain?

42:30.047 --> 42:33.133
- Who here seems out of place?

42:33.133 --> 42:35.052
- Um, I do?

42:35.177 --> 42:37.137
I'm a little too cute for all of y'all.

42:37.763 --> 42:39.056
- All right, yeah maybe,

42:39.056 --> 42:41.725
but if Chris was here,
I wouldn't even ask.

42:41.725 --> 42:44.436
- It's true, Nick, he's the weak link.

42:44.436 --> 42:46.605
- I agree, if I have a vote,

42:46.605 --> 42:48.065
women's right and everything.

42:49.358 --> 42:50.192
- Aw everybody's included.

42:50.192 --> 42:51.569
- Look you guys,

42:51.569 --> 42:53.654
I think that if someone can make it

42:53.654 --> 42:54.822
it's better than none of us.

42:56.323 --> 42:57.950
(breathing out heavily)

42:58.284 --> 42:59.493
So what's the plan then?

43:00.619 --> 43:02.663
- We've agreed not to snoop around.

43:02.663 --> 43:03.622
- Oh.

43:03.622 --> 43:04.957
Oh we did?

43:04.957 --> 43:06.250
Oh man, that's crazy.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.710
What else did we agree on?

43:07.710 --> 43:08.544
- Look, nothing.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.546
I just think it's best if we just go back

43:10.546 --> 43:13.299
to our normal lives and
just hope things blow over.

43:13.299 --> 43:14.133
- Right.

43:15.384 --> 43:18.012
So how do we go back
to normal lives though?

43:18.012 --> 43:18.846
- What then?

43:21.974 --> 43:25.436
- I say we cause a little chaos.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.270
- What?

43:27.521 --> 43:28.522
- [Danny] Come here.

43:33.193 --> 43:35.154
- This is never gonna work.

43:35.154 --> 43:35.988
- I know.

43:37.948 --> 43:39.783
- Well, it was nice knowing you.

43:43.203 --> 43:44.747
- You too.

43:44.747 --> 43:47.249
Shame and all but, thanks I guess.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.252
- I'm just so sick of being
shot as the messenger.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.214
- I got it.

43:56.383 --> 43:57.593
-Deal? oh yeh.

43:59.011 --> 44:00.095
[Marko] Yo listen up.

44:01.347 --> 44:02.723
We've got something we gotta talk about.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.850
- Oh that's crazy, so do we.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.143
- [Marko] Doesn't matter.

44:06.143 --> 44:08.228
- Ooh, sounds serious.

44:08.228 --> 44:09.813
Okay go ahead.

44:09.813 --> 44:13.776
- Look, this isn't working out.

44:13.776 --> 44:17.905
So we think we should split up.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.657
- What the fuck, no.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.616
- I just came back.

44:22.034 --> 44:24.411
- Look, king of kings, that's
not how it's gonna happen.

44:24.411 --> 44:26.830
Come here, sit down,
look, listen, come on.

44:26.830 --> 44:27.665
- Why?

44:28.332 --> 44:30.250
-We're the majority

44:30.250 --> 44:31.794
so we're staying together regardless.

44:31.794 --> 44:34.338
- We decided not to have a connection.

44:34.338 --> 44:35.798
- No we didn't.

44:35.798 --> 44:39.551
Also, we have some unfinished business.

44:39.551 --> 44:40.552
- What are you talking about?

44:40.552 --> 44:41.887
- Sarah saw one of those sick fucks

44:41.887 --> 44:43.681
that Frankie used to share her with.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.307
- What?

44:45.307 --> 44:46.684
That can't be.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.561
- Look, I wasn't gonna say anything but,

44:49.561 --> 44:51.397
Lin convinced me.

44:51.397 --> 44:52.940
And then Nick volunteered.

44:53.899 --> 44:55.609
- Volunteered for what?

44:55.609 --> 44:56.568
- To kick his ass.

44:56.568 --> 44:57.695
- No.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.238
- What are you talking about?

44:59.238 --> 45:00.072
- Don't worry.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.074
We got this.

45:05.035 --> 45:06.245
- Look, are you sure?

45:07.287 --> 45:08.205
- [Nick] She's sure.

45:08.205 --> 45:09.164
- She might not be.

45:09.164 --> 45:13.127
- If somebody did to you
what this man did to me,

45:13.127 --> 45:16.171
you wouldn't forget his face, Danny.

45:16.171 --> 45:17.506
- [Danny] Sarah.

45:17.506 --> 45:18.966
- Leave her alone, Danny.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.259
- Look, this is a mistake.

45:21.135 --> 45:21.969
- I guess it's a good thing

45:21.969 --> 45:24.138
we don't need your permission, huh?

45:24.138 --> 45:24.972
Come on.

45:30.144 --> 45:31.186
- Look.

45:31.186 --> 45:33.981
I'm better off, I'm going with them.

45:34.106 --> 45:35.190
(electronic music)

45:42.448 --> 45:43.907
- All right, thanks, man.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.576
- Have a good day.

45:45.576 --> 45:46.535
(bashing)

45:46.535 --> 45:47.953
- [Vendor] Jesus!

45:52.833 --> 45:53.667
- Stop, stop!

45:53.667 --> 45:54.960
- Stop, that's his daughter!

45:54.960 --> 45:55.794
- Stop!

46:00.048 --> 46:01.383
- Everybody go!
- Help, please!

46:01.383 --> 46:02.968
- Come on, come on.

46:06.305 --> 46:09.391
(light violin music)

46:16.190 --> 46:18.525
- Stop, stop, wait for Lin.

46:26.366 --> 46:27.367
- What's up?

46:27.367 --> 46:28.744
- Not fucking cool.

46:30.037 --> 46:30.871
- Hey we lost you guys.

46:30.871 --> 46:32.164
- Lost us, you fucking left us behind.

46:32.164 --> 46:33.540
- Yeah you fucking coward!

46:33.540 --> 46:35.584
- [Nick] Whoah, whoah.
-[Lin] What the hell, man?

46:35.584 --> 46:37.753
- Dale Jackson of Idaho?

46:37.753 --> 46:39.379
This is one of Frankie's
perverted friends?

46:39.379 --> 46:40.714
What were they, pen pals?

46:40.714 --> 46:42.549
- I would never forget that face.

46:42.549 --> 46:44.760
- So why was he caught
carrying all this cash

46:44.760 --> 46:46.428
and tourist shit?

46:46.428 --> 46:47.596
- What?

46:47.596 --> 46:48.889
- Don't fucking what me, Sarah .

46:48.889 --> 46:50.057
This isn't a game.

46:50.057 --> 46:50.891
- Yeah, hmm.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.352
Yeah, think you'd been to the zoo lately?

46:57.105 --> 46:57.981
- Take a good look.

47:00.943 --> 47:01.777
- Sarah.

47:04.279 --> 47:05.989
So that wasn't him?

47:05.989 --> 47:06.824
I can't be here.

47:06.824 --> 47:08.116
- You can't go anywhere.

47:10.661 --> 47:11.745
- Whoah, whoah whoah.

47:11.745 --> 47:12.996
You can't take all of it.

47:12.996 --> 47:14.456
- I'm not gonna keep any of this.

47:14.456 --> 47:16.792
- What are you gonna do with it right now?

47:16.792 --> 47:18.085
- Me, nothing.

47:18.085 --> 47:20.003
You will need this to find out.

47:22.548 --> 47:24.174
- [Lin] Really, 23d floor?

47:26.593 --> 47:29.346
- Damn.
(Lin laughing)

47:30.722 --> 47:32.599
Look at the view, guys.
- What the?

47:32.599 --> 47:33.433
- This is what having
parents is like, huh?

47:33.433 --> 47:34.643
- What does your mom do again?

47:36.061 --> 47:37.521
- [Nick] Smells like privilege.

47:37.521 --> 47:38.438
- [Lin] Oh yeah.

47:39.815 --> 47:41.024
- Hey man, this is a nice place.

47:41.024 --> 47:42.442
How many questions they gonna ask me

47:42.442 --> 47:43.694
before they let me upstairs?

47:43.694 --> 47:44.611
- I know.

47:44.611 --> 47:46.655
The doormen here are out of control.

47:46.655 --> 47:47.865
Was it Pete?

47:47.865 --> 47:48.699
- Pete.

47:50.158 --> 47:52.327
- Here, take this.

47:52.327 --> 47:54.371
Not that you seem to need it or anything.

47:55.956 --> 47:56.790
It's two grand.

47:58.208 --> 47:59.418
We'll send the money back plus more

47:59.418 --> 48:01.295
if we can ever afford it.

48:01.295 --> 48:03.839
- Okay, I'll make it work.

48:03.839 --> 48:05.591
I'm just glad he's not dead.

48:05.591 --> 48:06.425
- Too soon.

48:09.469 --> 48:11.430
- Look, I'm not really great
with this type of shit, right,

48:11.430 --> 48:15.559
but I realize we got
off onto a rocky start.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.855
I think we could still rebuild it

48:21.315 --> 48:22.691
if you want to.

48:23.775 --> 48:25.777
- I've always wanted to.

48:25.777 --> 48:27.738
- Why do you wanna give this up?

48:27.738 --> 48:29.740
- Oh, these places are never mine.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.074
We go like living in a place like this

48:31.074 --> 48:34.453
to out in the boondocks
after some afternoon fight.

48:34.453 --> 48:36.622
These rich guys will never marry my mom.

48:36.622 --> 48:38.206
Specially while I'm still here.

48:38.206 --> 48:39.833
- I'm sorry it's like that.

48:39.833 --> 48:41.418
- Don't be.

48:41.418 --> 48:43.837
I need to take control of my own life

48:43.837 --> 48:45.631
and a few others by the looks of it.

48:46.506 --> 48:47.633
- So what we gonna do?

48:49.176 --> 48:51.386
- We need to find a way
to offset our fuckups.

48:52.262 --> 48:53.180
- What you want us to do,

48:53.180 --> 48:55.140
help out ladies cross the street and shit?

48:56.141 --> 48:58.060
- I'm thinking we need to do a
hell of a lot more than that.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.645
- I agree.

48:59.645 --> 49:01.271
- The way I see it,

49:01.271 --> 49:03.106
a bunch of juvenile delinquents

49:03.106 --> 49:05.484
aren't gonna be given a second chance.

49:05.484 --> 49:07.527
We're gonna have to
make one for ourselves.

49:08.570 --> 49:09.404
- How?

49:10.614 --> 49:12.532
- By fighting back for those who can't.

49:13.951 --> 49:17.120
- So, what you want us
to chase after scumbags?

49:20.207 --> 49:21.708
- What have we got to lose?

49:21.708 --> 49:23.001
- Ooh, that's what I'm talking about.

49:23.001 --> 49:25.003
Look, we go outside, we
protect the streets and shit

49:25.003 --> 49:26.797
like those crazy
motherfuckers on TV, right?

49:26.797 --> 49:28.548
Lets go and let's fucking, just take--

49:28.548 --> 49:29.383
- No.

49:30.425 --> 49:32.761
We meet in private and remain anonymous.

49:33.845 --> 49:35.097
You want to go dress up in underpants,

49:35.097 --> 49:35.973
do it without me.

49:37.516 --> 49:38.934
- Maybe I will.

49:38.934 --> 49:40.602
- Hey man, we'll get famous.

49:40.602 --> 49:42.145
- What, get arrested, you mean?

49:43.355 --> 49:45.857
Evil as he was, we killed that man.

49:47.192 --> 49:49.361
- Okay, so what's your plan?

49:50.529 --> 49:52.572
- We can't stop bad things from happening

49:53.865 --> 49:57.202
but we might be able to do
something about it if they do.

49:57.202 --> 49:59.121
- Well if we're helping people, I'm in.

49:59.121 --> 49:59.955
- Nobody's in.

50:00.914 --> 50:02.332
You can't undo or unsee things.

50:02.332 --> 50:04.251
So please take your decision seriously.

50:05.794 --> 50:08.255
If you're in, show up
here tomorrow at four p.m.

50:09.214 --> 50:11.133
Come on, everybody out.

50:11.133 --> 50:11.967
- Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah,

50:11.967 --> 50:13.218
wait, wait, what's the rush?

50:13.218 --> 50:15.679
- Yeah I spent more time
talking to Pete's bitch ass.

50:15.679 --> 50:18.056
- Odds are this is gonna
lead to a life in jail.

50:20.726 --> 50:22.477
It's not a group decision.

50:22.477 --> 50:24.187
Come on, go sleep on it.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.105
Everybody out.

50:25.105 --> 50:26.982
Four p.m. tomorrow, people.

50:26.982 --> 50:27.816
- Well.

50:29.443 --> 50:30.610
It's all good, I'm in.

50:32.112 --> 50:33.196
- No more alliances.

50:36.742 --> 50:37.576
- I'm in too.

50:39.077 --> 50:40.537
- I'm in.

50:40.537 --> 50:41.830
I feel you, you see?

50:41.830 --> 50:43.540
You never leave the family behind.

50:45.834 --> 50:47.044
You know, the movie.

50:48.003 --> 50:49.921
Common knowledge, Danny.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.133
- I'm in too, Mr. President.

50:53.133 --> 50:55.761
- I'll know you're in tomorrow, four p.m.

50:55.761 --> 50:57.554
- Four p.m.?

50:57.554 --> 50:58.972
That's your birthday.

50:58.972 --> 51:00.557
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

51:01.808 --> 51:03.143
- Well I'll think about it.

51:04.394 --> 51:05.228
- Thanks.

51:07.064 --> 51:08.190
- I'm in, Danny, but,

51:09.149 --> 51:12.069
you need to remember what you promised me.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.820
I'm not gonna turn a blind eye anymore

51:13.820 --> 51:15.197
so you better have my back.

51:19.117 --> 51:20.869
(door shuts)

51:24.331 --> 51:26.166
- How come we always gotta
go meet up with Danny?

51:26.166 --> 51:28.210
How come he can't bring his ass down here?

51:29.169 --> 51:30.462
- Would you rather have
a meeting on his couch

51:30.587 --> 51:31.588
or in the penthouse?

51:32.923 --> 51:34.841
- How about no more meetings or beatings?

51:36.343 --> 51:37.135
- On the couch?

51:40.097 --> 51:42.390
- [ Lin] So I'm thinking,
not for my personal business

51:42.390 --> 51:45.852
but my landlord, and I tell
you, he was peeking looking--

51:45.852 --> 51:46.686
- [Danny] Okay, okay.

51:46.686 --> 51:47.854
Guys, just come out here for a sec.

51:47.854 --> 51:49.314
- [Lin] What the hell is that?

51:52.692 --> 51:56.446
- Membership requires both
a pledge and an initiation.

51:57.322 --> 51:59.407
- Yeah I'm not playing
your silly boy's game.

51:59.407 --> 52:01.076
- Well, it's not optional.

52:01.076 --> 52:03.328
And information is for members only.

52:04.996 --> 52:08.041
- Wait, is that the
knife from Frank's house?

52:08.041 --> 52:09.167
- Hey, hold on man, you got no right.

52:09.167 --> 52:12.546
- The same type of knife
that brought us together

52:12.546 --> 52:13.839
will bond us.

52:13.839 --> 52:14.923
- [Sarah] All right, give it to me.

52:14.923 --> 52:15.799
- Hold on.

52:17.092 --> 52:17.968
Danny first.

52:26.643 --> 52:28.228
- [Danny] (gasping) Shit.

52:29.771 --> 52:32.149
(cackling)

52:32.149 --> 52:33.650
- Check on him.

52:33.650 --> 52:36.862
- Yeah, check on the badass. (chuckling)

52:41.366 --> 52:42.200
- Relax, man.

52:43.743 --> 52:44.744
Chicks love scars.

52:45.954 --> 52:46.997
- Yeah, I'm sure.

52:49.291 --> 52:50.584
- Look.

52:50.584 --> 52:54.796
I like where this is going.

52:54.796 --> 52:56.047
- It was stupid.

52:56.047 --> 52:59.009
- Ain't nothing stupid about
asking people to commit.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.178
It's not like we're putting
together the school band.

53:03.388 --> 53:04.222
- Should we be doing this?

53:04.222 --> 53:05.849
- Don't you dare lose faith now.

53:06.933 --> 53:08.393
- I can't even do this right.

53:08.393 --> 53:09.561
- [Marko] Man, forget about the finger.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.188
Look.

53:11.188 --> 53:14.399
Without this, we've got nothing.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.152
Everybody wants in.

53:17.694 --> 53:18.528
I want in.

53:21.823 --> 53:22.908
- What if we fuck it up?

53:23.867 --> 53:25.118
- Then we fuck it up.

53:25.118 --> 53:26.912
- It could get nasty.

53:26.912 --> 53:28.079
- I'm counting on that.

53:29.331 --> 53:31.166
- What about those rabbits out there?

53:33.793 --> 53:34.711
- Look where I am.

53:38.215 --> 53:39.299
Come on, man.

53:46.264 --> 53:48.600
- Looks like a vampire buffet.

53:52.646 --> 53:53.521
- It's the only way in.

54:05.492 --> 54:06.493
- Be gentle.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.962
Okay that didn't hurt that much.

54:29.057 --> 54:30.225
- Come on man.

54:32.978 --> 54:34.813
I'm in all the way, Danny.

54:34.854 --> 54:36.815
Your wounds will be my wounds.

54:36.815 --> 54:38.358
- Yeah whatever he said.

54:38.400 --> 54:39.484
Whatever, just give me this

54:42.487 --> 54:44.656
Ooh, son of a tit.

54:44.656 --> 54:46.658
- Oh come on, now I'm the only dude

54:46.658 --> 54:47.659
with a little prick.

54:48.326 --> 54:49.786
- Don't even trip, dog.

54:49.786 --> 54:50.954
Some boy's pricks are bigger than others,

54:50.954 --> 54:51.788
you know what I mean?

54:51.788 --> 54:52.622
- Give me that.

54:56.209 --> 54:57.544
Ain't no way I'm gonna
let y'all give me shit

54:57.544 --> 54:58.378
about this too.

54:58.461 --> 55:00.880
- So was the cock measuring competition

55:00.880 --> 55:03.258
supposed to be before or
after the pledge, guys?

55:03.300 --> 55:06.052
- Honestly, it would have
been easier to whip them out.

55:08.013 --> 55:09.597
- Wish you told me that before.

55:12.100 --> 55:14.144
- It gets real from here.

55:14.144 --> 55:15.603
Don't say you weren't warned.

55:19.649 --> 55:23.320
- Of my own free will, I have
decided to join this group.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.738
- Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah.

55:24.738 --> 55:26.072
What's all this group shit?

55:26.072 --> 55:27.782
You should throw our real name up in there.

55:28.742 --> 55:29.576
- What name?

55:31.202 --> 55:33.246
- Fucking juvenile delinquents.

55:33.246 --> 55:34.080
The JDs.

55:35.373 --> 55:36.875
Look, you said it the other day, right?

55:36.875 --> 55:38.835
I think all of us were feeling it.

55:38.835 --> 55:40.545
We all like it, right?

55:40.545 --> 55:42.464
- Yeah, we all like it.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.092
- Juvenile Delinquents.

55:47.218 --> 55:48.053
One sec.

55:53.933 --> 55:55.852
Of my own free will,

55:56.186 --> 55:59.272
I've decided to join the
Juvenile Delinquents.

55:59.397 --> 56:03.151
To my fellow JDs, I make this pledge.

56:03.151 --> 56:05.153
- I will never reveal your identities

56:05.195 --> 56:07.113
regardless to any danger to myself.

56:07.113 --> 56:09.824
- I will protect my fellow JDs always.

56:09.866 --> 56:11.910
- I will obey the rules
and do what is asked

56:11.993 --> 56:13.328
for the greater good.

56:13.453 --> 56:15.413
- I need not worry about my former life

56:15.538 --> 56:16.956
'cause this is my life now.

56:16.956 --> 56:19.292
- With my blood which I mix with yours,

56:19.292 --> 56:20.919
I am bonded forever.

56:20.919 --> 56:23.880
- [All] Your wounds will be my wounds.

56:28.176 --> 56:29.469
- You with us?

56:29.469 --> 56:30.970
- Yeah.

56:30.970 --> 56:32.514
- What you thinking about?

56:33.390 --> 56:34.516
- I don't know.

56:34.516 --> 56:38.937
It's just nice to belong
to something for once.

56:38.937 --> 56:39.771
- Yeah.

56:41.064 --> 56:42.690
- Hey, you gonna throw this away?

56:43.983 --> 56:45.443
- Yeah I was, why?

56:46.152 --> 56:49.656
Um, no I think it's best if we, okay.

56:54.661 --> 56:56.996
So, any ideas?

56:58.623 --> 57:00.583
Okay, keep them up if you think

57:00.583 --> 57:02.669
we can do what's needed
with what we've got.

57:06.589 --> 57:10.176
- Do you think we can kidnap executives

57:10.176 --> 57:12.262
from a pharmaceutical company?

57:13.263 --> 57:15.056
- And keep them where, stupid?

57:15.056 --> 57:17.142
- Hey, no idea is stupid.

57:18.017 --> 57:19.018
- Thank you.

57:19.894 --> 57:22.063
- You know, just baby steps first.

57:23.356 --> 57:26.109
- Good, 'cause we could do mine right now.

57:26.109 --> 57:27.652
- JDs can't start like this.

57:29.320 --> 57:31.948
- So what happened to all that
your wound is my wound shit?

57:31.948 --> 57:33.450
- You'll be the prime suspect.

57:37.370 --> 57:39.581
Does anyone have a problem
helping a friend out

57:39.581 --> 57:40.832
down the track?

57:40.832 --> 57:41.666
- No.

57:41.666 --> 57:42.500
- Not at all.

57:43.543 --> 57:45.128
- Hey, it's good bro.

57:45.128 --> 57:46.337
I'll kill one of those
motherfuckers if I need to.

57:46.337 --> 57:47.172
shit.

57:47.172 --> 57:49.632
- JDs won't be asking anyone to kill.

57:49.632 --> 57:51.342
- [Ryker] What the fuck?

57:51.801 --> 57:54.053
- This isn't Murderers Incorporated.

57:54.053 --> 57:55.638
- No more deaths for me, sorry.

57:56.764 --> 57:58.016
- Me neither.

57:58.057 --> 58:00.185
- Why give them an easy way out?

58:00.393 --> 58:02.228
I mean Frank got lucky if you ask me.

58:02.812 --> 58:03.897
- 'Cause I want them dead.

58:03.897 --> 58:04.814
- Yeah, then what?

58:06.816 --> 58:08.026
What if I gave you a jar

58:08.276 --> 58:09.903
with two Achilles tendons in it?

58:10.445 --> 58:12.530
A reminder, they won't be sneaking up

58:12.530 --> 58:14.782
on anyone ever again.

58:14.782 --> 58:16.868
- They won't be able to sneak?

58:16.868 --> 58:17.785
- They can't walk.

58:20.079 --> 58:20.914
Make them pay?

58:25.126 --> 58:26.085
- Make them pay.

58:26.085 --> 58:28.546
- Okay, boys, how will
the JDs be starting?

58:31.758 --> 58:32.592
- I got one.

58:35.136 --> 58:37.931
I got a guy who murdered
his fiancee in cold blood.

58:39.641 --> 58:43.770
His claim was she was in a
coked out rage, self-defense.

58:49.609 --> 58:50.902
- Okay.

58:50.902 --> 58:51.736
Research then.

58:53.196 --> 58:54.989
- [Nick] Oh, good idea Sarah.

58:54.989 --> 58:56.533
See what sites Danny visits.

58:56.533 --> 58:59.244
I'm sure it's not all
just research, right?

58:59.244 --> 59:00.745
- Hey man, I'm not confirming anything

59:00.745 --> 59:02.539
but if the internet
didn't have porn on it,

59:02.539 --> 59:05.166
there'd be three billion less users.

59:05.166 --> 59:06.626
- That's a fact.

59:08.127 --> 59:11.714
- Girls, why don't you
be in charge of the HQ,

59:11.714 --> 59:13.383
see if you can find us a place.

59:14.551 --> 59:15.385
- You got it.

59:15.385 --> 59:18.054
- Boys, you be in charge of recon.

59:18.054 --> 59:21.182
I mean all of us need to
be thinking about finances.

59:21.182 --> 59:22.517
- Shit, you guys.

59:22.517 --> 59:23.351
This is her.

59:27.313 --> 59:28.982
- Ugh, is that her dad?

59:28.982 --> 59:29.899
- Yeah.

59:29.899 --> 59:31.067
Yeah we gotta help him.

59:32.902 --> 59:34.195
- What do you think those keys are for?

59:35.989 --> 59:37.907
- Probably for like her
first car or some shit.

59:37.907 --> 59:39.158
- Or her first apartment.

59:41.452 --> 59:42.370
- They look happy.

59:45.498 --> 59:49.002
- Look at all these beautiful
comments that people left.

59:50.628 --> 59:52.255
- This feels a little weird, guys.

59:53.840 --> 59:55.341
- I think it's okay.

59:55.341 --> 59:58.636
Let's just try to see if
we can track down the dad.

59:58.636 --> 59:59.470
- Okay.

1:00:00.888 --> 1:00:03.308
[Sarah] Yeah I really don't think
we're gonna find anything.

1:00:03.308 --> 1:00:04.267
- No shit.

1:00:05.476 --> 1:00:09.147
I mean, that was the fucking hardest job.

1:00:09.147 --> 1:00:10.607
Like can you tell your little boyfriend

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:12.066
to give us like a car?

1:00:12.066 --> 1:00:13.568
- Okay, you know he's not gonna do that.

1:00:13.568 --> 1:00:15.069
- Atleast a metro card.

1:00:16.279 --> 1:00:17.322
Well, oh, oh.

1:00:18.364 --> 1:00:19.699
- I'll talk to him.

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:22.285
- Mhmm so you admit he's your boyfriend.

1:00:23.828 --> 1:00:24.662
Hmm.

1:00:25.955 --> 1:00:27.206
- God, all right, okay.

1:00:27.206 --> 1:00:31.085
Let's just look for
another hour, head back.

1:00:32.712 --> 1:00:33.546
Come on.

1:00:38.384 --> 1:00:40.219
- What happens if I push you?

1:00:40.219 --> 1:00:41.596
I mean, we made a pledge.

1:00:41.596 --> 1:00:43.973
- Bitch. (laughing)

1:00:43.973 --> 1:00:46.017
[Lin] Hello ladies.

1:00:46.017 --> 1:00:46.976
- Any luck on HQ?

1:00:48.561 --> 1:00:50.980
- Big fat zero on that one.

1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:52.607
What about you guys?

1:00:52.607 --> 1:00:53.816
- He throws hail Mary.

1:00:53.816 --> 1:00:55.526
Two seconds left on the clock.

1:00:55.526 --> 1:00:56.819
- Oh, touchdown!

1:00:58.696 --> 1:01:00.031
- Sounds promising.

1:01:00.031 --> 1:01:01.908
- Not only did we find Mr. Thomas Griffin,

1:01:01.908 --> 1:01:03.242
we found where he works.

1:01:03.242 --> 1:01:04.786
- Wait, how?

1:01:04.786 --> 1:01:06.454
- Super secret agent stuff, girl.

1:01:06.454 --> 1:01:08.414
I'll tell you but then I'd
have to kill you. (clicking)

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:10.291
- The boys followed Thomas on the bus.

1:01:10.291 --> 1:01:13.503
- Undetected on a bus.

1:01:13.503 --> 1:01:15.380
- For the moment we're
taking their word for it.

1:01:15.380 --> 1:01:17.215
- So you got the dud?

1:01:17.215 --> 1:01:19.050
- Yup.

1:01:19.050 --> 1:01:21.010
And without being able to
contact dumb and dumber over here

1:01:21.010 --> 1:01:23.388
I spent all day on lookout
while they caught Zs.

1:01:24.389 --> 1:01:25.556
- It's called victory sleep.

1:01:25.556 --> 1:01:26.432
You wouldn't understand.

1:01:26.432 --> 1:01:27.642
- Slept like a baby.

1:01:27.642 --> 1:01:28.851
- Okay, enough.

1:01:28.851 --> 1:01:30.436
Girls, come have a look at this.

1:01:31.979 --> 1:01:33.523
We're gonna give Thomas a note.

1:01:38.695 --> 1:01:39.570
Hey, hey man.

1:01:40.446 --> 1:01:41.698
Hey, sorry.

1:01:43.616 --> 1:01:45.368
You wanna earn 20 bucks real quick?

1:01:48.371 --> 1:01:49.872
- 20 bucks for what?

1:01:51.290 --> 1:01:54.043
(light music)

1:02:36.502 --> 1:02:37.336
- Flying solo?

1:02:40.381 --> 1:02:41.591
Well she's gonna miss out.

1:02:42.508 --> 1:02:43.718
- Hey boys.

1:02:43.718 --> 1:02:44.761
- Don't interrupt.

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:45.887
- What's up, Red?

1:02:45.887 --> 1:02:46.929
Goddamit.

1:02:46.929 --> 1:02:47.805
- Woah Bitch! Get off

1:02:47.805 --> 1:02:48.765
- We're on the same team!

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:50.308
- [Marko] Kiss my ass.

1:02:50.308 --> 1:02:51.434
- They all look busy.

1:02:51.434 --> 1:02:53.936
- Yeah, they've been at it for hours.

1:02:53.936 --> 1:02:55.688
- So how'd it go?

1:02:55.688 --> 1:02:57.273
- It was unbelievable.

1:02:57.273 --> 1:02:58.524
Thomas almost fainted.

1:02:59.358 --> 1:03:00.193
I was across the street,

1:03:00.193 --> 1:03:01.736
I felt like I was gonna cry.

1:03:01.736 --> 1:03:02.570
It was amazing.

1:03:03.988 --> 1:03:05.823
I found what I wanna do with my life.

1:03:06.949 --> 1:03:08.451
We're planning the meet now.

1:03:08.451 --> 1:03:10.328
- Okay but tell me more about Thomas.

1:03:16.667 --> 1:03:17.668
(laughing)

1:03:17.668 --> 1:03:20.046
- Oh man, I didn't know
it was fancy dress.

1:03:21.422 --> 1:03:23.007
- Don't want them to think I'm a kid.

1:03:23.007 --> 1:03:23.841
- Maybe you should have chose somebody

1:03:23.841 --> 1:03:25.426
whose balls dropped.

1:03:25.426 --> 1:03:26.552
- Cut me some slack.

1:03:26.552 --> 1:03:27.804
Remember the signal?

1:03:27.804 --> 1:03:28.763
- Yeah.

1:03:28.763 --> 1:03:29.972
Thomas is a good guy, okay?

1:03:29.972 --> 1:03:31.599
We wanna help him out.

1:03:31.599 --> 1:03:34.101
Besides, if anything goes
wrong, I'll be right here.

1:03:37.313 --> 1:03:38.940
Put the Delinquents on the map, man.

1:03:40.608 --> 1:03:41.609
Show time, come on.

1:03:55.414 --> 1:03:57.917
(tense music)

1:03:59.293 --> 1:04:00.545
- I hope you're for real.

1:04:02.547 --> 1:04:03.381
- We are.

1:04:07.009 --> 1:04:08.845
- Everything you need is in this bag.

1:04:10.513 --> 1:04:11.514
- Don't turn around.

1:04:17.311 --> 1:04:18.354
Are you armed?

1:04:18.354 --> 1:04:20.106
- I want you to kill him with that.

1:04:21.148 --> 1:04:22.817
- We're not assassins.

1:04:22.817 --> 1:04:24.443
- He deserves to die.

1:04:27.530 --> 1:04:29.073
No, no please, don't leave.

1:04:30.950 --> 1:04:33.202
He murdered her and I did nothing.

1:04:35.413 --> 1:04:36.831
- I'm sorry for your loss.

1:04:42.128 --> 1:04:43.129
But you should know.

1:04:45.298 --> 1:04:46.340
People do care.

1:04:48.301 --> 1:04:49.135
- What people?

1:04:50.177 --> 1:04:51.053
Nobody cared.

1:04:52.763 --> 1:04:53.598
- We care.

1:05:00.396 --> 1:05:01.230
- Thank you.

1:05:02.648 --> 1:05:04.317
We think Jess was gonna leave him.

1:05:05.318 --> 1:05:06.527
That's what set him off.

1:05:07.403 --> 1:05:09.530
- Is there enough in here to prove this?

1:05:09.530 --> 1:05:11.073
- I think so.

1:05:11.073 --> 1:05:12.408
If not, I can get more.

1:05:13.451 --> 1:05:15.620
I'll do anything, just
don't give up on us.

1:05:18.456 --> 1:05:19.749
- We can't work like that.

1:05:22.877 --> 1:05:24.921
- Then let me ask you just one thing.

1:05:26.881 --> 1:05:28.466
- Go on.

1:05:28.466 --> 1:05:32.303
- If you ever find yourself
hurting that bastard,

1:05:32.303 --> 1:05:35.014
I'd like you to erase my
daughter's name from his arm.

1:05:35.973 --> 1:05:39.810
He got a tattoo of her
after he murdered her

1:05:39.810 --> 1:05:42.229
just so he could sway the jury.

1:05:42.229 --> 1:05:43.814
He refuses to take it off.

1:05:45.232 --> 1:05:46.734
He mocked me with it in court.

1:05:48.361 --> 1:05:49.737
He's an evil bastard.

1:05:50.988 --> 1:05:52.239
- I'll see what I can do.

1:05:54.533 --> 1:05:55.493
How will I know?

1:05:55.493 --> 1:05:56.452
- [Danny] You won't.

1:05:56.452 --> 1:05:57.411
- Huh?

1:05:57.411 --> 1:05:58.704
- You're out from here on.

1:05:59.664 --> 1:06:02.291
This way nothing can trace back to you.

1:06:04.418 --> 1:06:05.378
But one day you'll know.

1:06:06.963 --> 1:06:07.797
Trust me.

1:06:09.256 --> 1:06:11.801
Nobody will ever be able
to take that away from you.

1:06:33.239 --> 1:06:35.241
- Yo, what's in the bag?

1:06:39.745 --> 1:06:41.914
Shit dude, God Bless America.

1:06:41.914 --> 1:06:43.124
- Hey, put that away.

1:06:45.251 --> 1:06:46.085
Are you crazy?
- Yeah.

1:06:46.085 --> 1:06:46.919
Sorry, my bad.

1:06:48.838 --> 1:06:50.965
There's gotta be thousands in here.

1:06:50.965 --> 1:06:52.008
- Yeah could be.

1:06:52.008 --> 1:06:53.592
- That'll seriously help us out.

1:06:58.222 --> 1:07:00.099
- Whoah, whoah, whoah.

1:07:00.099 --> 1:07:01.392
- They caught you at
the penthouse with this,

1:07:01.392 --> 1:07:03.310
you'd be out on your ass.

1:07:03.310 --> 1:07:04.562
- Yeah, no doubt.

1:07:05.813 --> 1:07:06.814
- Let me keep it, man.

1:07:06.814 --> 1:07:07.815
It'll be our secret.

1:07:10.776 --> 1:07:11.610
- You swear?

1:07:13.738 --> 1:07:14.989
- Yeah.

1:07:14.989 --> 1:07:16.574
I wouldn't be a very good sergeant-at-arms

1:07:16.574 --> 1:07:17.783
if I was a blabbermouth.

1:07:18.743 --> 1:07:19.577
I'm not my brother.

1:07:22.747 --> 1:07:24.749
(siren sounding in distance)

1:07:24.749 --> 1:07:25.583
You ready?

1:07:27.168 --> 1:07:28.002
- Yeah.

1:07:31.672 --> 1:07:34.008
(chuckling)

1:07:35.968 --> 1:07:38.054
- Danny, we're home honey.

1:07:38.095 --> 1:07:38.929
- Shit.

1:07:46.270 --> 1:07:49.523
(gasping and giggling)

1:07:52.318 --> 1:07:53.152
- Hey.

1:07:54.278 --> 1:07:57.531
This is a penthouse, not a clubhouse.

1:07:57.531 --> 1:07:58.699
You're gonna have to find somewhere else

1:07:58.699 --> 1:08:00.910
for your little gang to hide out.

1:08:00.910 --> 1:08:01.744
- What gang?

1:08:03.204 --> 1:08:04.955
- Pete works for me.

1:08:06.332 --> 1:08:09.251
And if you want things
to work out for your mom,

1:08:09.251 --> 1:08:10.836
you need to consider moving on.

1:08:12.588 --> 1:08:13.839
- Oh hi, Danny.

1:08:14.256 --> 1:08:16.133
- You don't wanna hang
around for this now, do you?

1:08:16.133 --> 1:08:17.885
- No, I don't,

1:08:17.885 --> 1:08:19.053
but what am I supposed to do?

1:08:19.053 --> 1:08:20.096
Go live in a tent?

1:08:21.388 --> 1:08:22.932
Jesus, fricking disgusting.

1:08:23.808 --> 1:08:25.017
Shit's worse than juvie.

1:08:28.771 --> 1:08:29.605
Ugh.

1:08:29.605 --> 1:08:31.190
- [Lin] He's here.

1:08:38.072 --> 1:08:39.198
- How much is in the bag?

1:08:40.324 --> 1:08:42.201
- Eight thousand exactly.

1:08:43.661 --> 1:08:46.330
- How much is eight thousand
divided by six exactly?

1:08:47.957 --> 1:08:49.083
- It's not spending money.

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:50.209
- You can't hog it all.

1:08:51.127 --> 1:08:53.671
- I can give out some
but we all need jobs.

1:08:53.671 --> 1:08:55.840
Respectable cover lives, remember?

1:08:55.840 --> 1:08:57.675
- [Girls] We got jobs.

1:08:59.009 --> 1:09:00.386
- We just got out of the cell.

1:09:00.386 --> 1:09:02.179
We need some money for necessities.

1:09:03.764 --> 1:09:05.516
- What, girls and booze?

1:09:05.516 --> 1:09:07.101
- Like I said, necessities.

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:10.729
- Fine, 200 each.

1:09:10.729 --> 1:09:13.482
There's still the matter of Mr. Jackson.

1:09:13.482 --> 1:09:15.484
- No, that pedo's not
getting any of my money.

1:09:15.484 --> 1:09:17.695
- You put a guy taking
his kids on vacation

1:09:17.695 --> 1:09:18.779
in the hospital.

1:09:18.779 --> 1:09:19.697
- Fuck you I did.

1:09:20.906 --> 1:09:21.699
- You did.

1:09:23.534 --> 1:09:26.954
- Look, there's no way he's
making a profit out of this.

1:09:26.954 --> 1:09:28.497
- He didn't ask to be beaten.

1:09:28.497 --> 1:09:30.040
- Well he can have all of mine.

1:09:32.126 --> 1:09:32.960
- Yeah why not?

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:35.129
I mean she's the one
that caused all of it.

1:09:35.129 --> 1:09:36.547
- Well he can have mine too.

1:09:37.923 --> 1:09:39.925
- Well that's easy for
you to say, we got jobs.

1:09:42.970 --> 1:09:43.929
- You part of this?

1:09:45.764 --> 1:09:47.099
- There's no shallow end in this pool.

1:09:50.060 --> 1:09:52.229
- Look, I'm giving him everything, okay?

1:09:54.231 --> 1:09:56.609
- Sarah, everyone's in.

1:09:57.484 --> 1:09:58.319
Or should be.

1:10:02.031 --> 1:10:04.825
The money's gonna help
Dale and his family, okay?

1:10:05.784 --> 1:10:08.037
Just tell us about you
guys' hunt for our HQ.

1:10:11.582 --> 1:10:12.666
- Nothing good yet.

1:10:12.666 --> 1:10:14.168
I mean it's not easy finding a place

1:10:14.168 --> 1:10:15.544
without people around.

1:10:15.544 --> 1:10:16.629
- Keep it up.

1:10:16.629 --> 1:10:17.546
The penthouse is a bust

1:10:17.546 --> 1:10:18.672
and if Pete has his way,

1:10:18.672 --> 1:10:20.007
I'll be looking for a new place.

1:10:20.007 --> 1:10:21.133
- Need help with that?

1:10:23.844 --> 1:10:24.678
I got you.

1:10:25.846 --> 1:10:27.848
- I'll be treasurer.

1:10:27.848 --> 1:10:29.892
- I was gonna keep the money at my place.

1:10:30.935 --> 1:10:32.519
- You just said that
you don't know how long

1:10:32.519 --> 1:10:33.729
you'll be there for.

1:10:33.729 --> 1:10:35.773
Plus, I'm good with numbers.

1:10:35.773 --> 1:10:36.982
- I second that.

1:10:36.982 --> 1:10:38.108
- Sounds good to me.

1:10:38.108 --> 1:10:41.612
- Yay yay, motion passed.

1:10:41.612 --> 1:10:43.155
- And what about your 200?

1:10:48.202 --> 1:10:49.828
(sighing)

1:10:49.828 --> 1:10:50.663
Thank you.

1:10:54.041 --> 1:10:56.585
- Okay, we need to start
going over this stuff.

1:11:09.890 --> 1:11:11.392
- Was this from Chris?

1:11:12.851 --> 1:11:14.019
- Yeah.

1:11:14.019 --> 1:11:16.105
- Well then he should be a JD.

1:11:16.105 --> 1:11:17.439
- Yeah.

1:11:17.439 --> 1:11:18.357
- Hundred percent.

1:11:19.608 --> 1:11:21.026
- No, we agreed.

1:11:22.695 --> 1:11:24.113
- We should at least ask him.

1:11:26.907 --> 1:11:28.826
- What did he think he was doing?

1:11:30.119 --> 1:11:31.704
- Helping me look for my father.

1:11:33.706 --> 1:11:34.999
- You lied to him?

1:11:34.999 --> 1:11:35.833
- [Danny] I had to.

1:11:35.833 --> 1:11:37.668
- Well shit, are you lying to us?

1:11:39.712 --> 1:11:40.629
- I'll talk to him.

1:11:40.629 --> 1:11:42.464
- No you won't.

1:11:42.464 --> 1:11:44.341
You lost your chance.

1:11:44.341 --> 1:11:45.801
We all wanna talk to him.

1:11:47.303 --> 1:11:49.138
- I'm not the bad guy here, remember?

1:11:51.307 --> 1:11:52.558
There's still a few important issues

1:11:52.558 --> 1:11:54.310
we need to go over.

1:11:54.310 --> 1:11:56.353
Like what the hell are
we gonna do with Toby.

1:11:57.980 --> 1:11:58.814
- Sorry.

1:12:00.858 --> 1:12:03.110
(knocking)

1:12:04.278 --> 1:12:05.112
- Go away, mom.

1:12:05.988 --> 1:12:06.822
I'm sleeping.

1:12:11.035 --> 1:12:12.119
- I'm not your mom.

1:12:12.995 --> 1:12:14.121
- Look, Oliver.

1:12:14.121 --> 1:12:15.205
- No, you look.

1:12:16.749 --> 1:12:18.542
I don't want you here.

1:12:18.542 --> 1:12:20.669
And neither does your mother.

1:12:20.669 --> 1:12:21.962
You're not a kid anymore.

1:12:21.962 --> 1:12:23.964
Anyone who served time in jail is a man

1:12:23.964 --> 1:12:25.341
whether he likes it or not.

1:12:27.092 --> 1:12:28.761
- Juvie's a jail for kids.

1:12:30.763 --> 1:12:33.307
- I know exactly where you were.

1:12:33.307 --> 1:12:35.809
Look, I'm a man of means.

1:12:36.643 --> 1:12:38.479
Women find me attractive.

1:12:38.479 --> 1:12:41.398
And that lends itself
to certain encounters.

1:12:42.274 --> 1:12:44.943
Sure you learned about
that stuff in school

1:12:44.943 --> 1:12:46.528
or the hard way in prison.

1:12:49.573 --> 1:12:52.743
I've no use for my beach
house since I met Vicky.

1:12:52.743 --> 1:12:54.870
And with the promise of good behavior,

1:12:57.039 --> 1:12:57.873
- I promise.

1:12:59.708 --> 1:13:00.542
- Now.

1:13:03.087 --> 1:13:05.631
You tell your mother you asked me for this

1:13:05.631 --> 1:13:07.257
and nothing about the ladies.

1:13:08.217 --> 1:13:09.551
That's between you and me.

1:13:21.939 --> 1:13:23.232
- Oh god.

1:13:23.941 --> 1:13:26.402
- You've seriously never
had a coffee before?

1:13:26.402 --> 1:13:28.445
- No, they don't usually
have cappuccino machines

1:13:28.445 --> 1:13:30.239
inside of orphanages Genius.

1:13:30.239 --> 1:13:32.699
- Just saying, all the stuff
that's happened so far,

1:13:32.699 --> 1:13:34.284
it's probably the craziest.

1:13:34.576 --> 1:13:35.619
Is this the spot?

1:13:35.619 --> 1:13:37.162
- [Marko] I hope so.

1:13:37.162 --> 1:13:38.956
- This is money.

1:13:38.956 --> 1:13:41.166
- [Marko] Seedy old
shagger to the rescue.

1:13:42.084 --> 1:13:44.169
It's right on the beach, it's so sick.

1:13:44.169 --> 1:13:45.421
- Can we go see it?

1:13:45.421 --> 1:13:48.132
- Secret lairs aren't any
good if they're not a secret.

1:13:48.132 --> 1:13:48.966
- Oh, pff.

1:13:50.008 --> 1:13:53.053
- Well, while you two are
supposed to be at the concierge,

1:13:53.053 --> 1:13:54.388
look what I got?

1:13:55.305 --> 1:13:56.515
- It's a black pouch.

1:13:56.515 --> 1:13:58.225
- Ain't nothing special.

1:13:58.225 --> 1:13:59.685
I got one too.

1:13:59.685 --> 1:14:01.103
(laughing)

1:14:01.228 --> 1:14:02.062
- Okay.

1:14:03.063 --> 1:14:06.400
- Well this one is gonna help
the JDs become a democracy.

1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:07.484
- And how's that?

1:14:13.198 --> 1:14:14.241
- [Nick] Blue for no.

1:14:16.243 --> 1:14:17.911
White for yes.

1:14:18.829 --> 1:14:20.998
- Hey, that's actually a good idea.

1:14:20.998 --> 1:14:23.167
- Yeah, brilliant.

1:14:24.168 --> 1:14:25.419
- Don't need to wait on my vote.

1:14:26.670 --> 1:14:30.466
That motherfucker's guilty and
I'm getting him regardless so

1:14:30.466 --> 1:14:31.300
- [Marko]Goddamit, Nick!

1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:33.719
And our votes don't count, I guess, huh?

1:14:33.719 --> 1:14:34.887
This has gotta stop.

1:14:34.887 --> 1:14:36.847
Otherwise the next vote's gonna be you.

1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:39.516
(sighing)

1:14:39.516 --> 1:14:40.350
- I'm sorry.

1:14:40.350 --> 1:14:41.435
- Don't apologize to me, man.

1:14:41.435 --> 1:14:42.811
I grew up with this shit.

1:14:45.522 --> 1:14:46.815
- Danny, I'm sorry.

1:14:46.815 --> 1:14:47.816
- Not him either, man.

1:14:47.816 --> 1:14:50.027
You're putting all of our lives at risk!

1:14:51.570 --> 1:14:52.613
- I'm sorry everyone.

1:15:02.664 --> 1:15:03.999
- Looks like we just greenlighted

1:15:03.999 --> 1:15:05.292
the JD's first mission.

1:15:07.211 --> 1:15:08.045
Extraction?

1:15:09.296 --> 1:15:12.883
- Oh, we have a rental
inspection every few months.

1:15:12.883 --> 1:15:13.717
- Sure.

1:15:15.052 --> 1:15:16.512
- We could fake up a real estate letter.

1:15:16.512 --> 1:15:18.722
- And we actually have
one so we can copy it.

1:15:18.722 --> 1:15:19.556
- That's good.

1:15:21.683 --> 1:15:23.101
- Where are we taking him to?

1:15:24.394 --> 1:15:25.229
- Beach house?

1:15:28.732 --> 1:15:29.608
- Come on Danny.

1:15:29.608 --> 1:15:30.442
The house across the street's empty

1:15:30.442 --> 1:15:31.652
and there's no one around.

1:15:36.907 --> 1:15:39.284
(laughing)

1:15:39.284 --> 1:15:40.118
- Yes!

1:15:41.745 --> 1:15:43.038
-[Lin] get my bikini

1:15:43.038 --> 1:15:44.206
- [Danny] Fine.

1:15:44.206 --> 1:15:46.208
(Lin laughing)

1:15:50.295 --> 1:15:51.380
- Thank god, hey.

1:15:51.380 --> 1:15:52.381
- What's up?
- Hey.

1:15:55.300 --> 1:15:56.885
- Huh, what's this?

1:15:58.929 --> 1:16:01.390
(chill music)

1:16:02.015 --> 1:16:02.975
What the fuck is this?

1:16:04.977 --> 1:16:05.811
- What?

1:16:06.853 --> 1:16:08.146
- See I knew you were involved.

1:16:08.146 --> 1:16:09.773
- Look, Marko is taking care of that.

1:16:09.773 --> 1:16:11.858
Well he was supposed to anyhow.

1:16:11.858 --> 1:16:13.026
- Yeah but you gave it to him.

1:16:13.110 --> 1:16:14.695
- As the sergeant-at-arms.

1:16:14.695 --> 1:16:15.946
He wanted it.

1:16:15.946 --> 1:16:17.281
- Sergeant, I ain't vote
no sergeant at arms!

1:16:17.322 --> 1:16:18.782
- Not everything's gonna be decided

1:16:18.824 --> 1:16:19.950
by your little pouch.

1:16:20.993 --> 1:16:22.286
- Look, that's not acceptable to me.

1:16:22.286 --> 1:16:23.745
- [Danny] Doesn't have to be.

1:16:23.745 --> 1:16:25.122
- [Nick] I should have been told.

1:16:25.122 --> 1:16:26.748
- All right.

1:16:26.748 --> 1:16:29.585
Who here wants Nick in charge of the gun?

1:16:30.043 --> 1:16:30.877
Raise your hands.

1:16:34.047 --> 1:16:36.466
- Hahahaha, very funny.

1:16:36.466 --> 1:16:37.593
Look, everybody else got a role.

1:16:37.593 --> 1:16:38.635
What do I do?

1:16:39.011 --> 1:16:41.263
- Roles are gonna pop up as we go along.

1:16:44.766 --> 1:16:46.310
- All right, what about planning?

1:16:46.893 --> 1:16:49.438
- We ain't planning any killing sprees.

1:16:50.105 --> 1:16:51.690
- What if your plans don't work?

1:16:52.649 --> 1:16:54.318
- I mean that is a fair point.

1:16:54.526 --> 1:16:57.029
- You know what, you've
second-guessed everything,

1:16:57.029 --> 1:16:59.656
so I'm happy to make it official,

1:16:59.656 --> 1:17:01.408
I mean if you really want it.

1:17:01.408 --> 1:17:02.492
- Oh I want it.

1:17:02.492 --> 1:17:03.952
What is it, what's it called?

1:17:05.495 --> 1:17:06.997
- Nag.

1:17:06.997 --> 1:17:08.832
(laughing)

1:17:08.832 --> 1:17:10.083
- Very funny.

1:17:10.334 --> 1:17:11.460
- Know-it-all.

1:17:12.628 --> 1:17:13.462
- Scrutinizer?

1:17:13.462 --> 1:17:14.296
- Ooh.

1:17:14.755 --> 1:17:15.839
- Gettin better.

1:17:15.839 --> 1:17:17.049
What about final say?

1:17:17.049 --> 1:17:18.634
- Not on your life.

1:17:18.634 --> 1:17:20.010
- Scrutinizer it is.

1:17:21.011 --> 1:17:22.304
- I won't be much help when things

1:17:22.304 --> 1:17:23.680
start to get nasty, so,

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:25.223
- Yeah but it's my role.

1:17:25.515 --> 1:17:26.433
- Oh.

1:17:26.850 --> 1:17:28.852
I would love to work under you.

1:17:28.852 --> 1:17:30.896
I love me a man in charge.

1:17:32.272 --> 1:17:33.106
- Look, I ain't got no doubt you work well

1:17:33.106 --> 1:17:36.026
under me, sweet cheeks. (clicking)

1:17:36.652 --> 1:17:37.486
All right you're hired

1:17:40.822 --> 1:17:41.990
So when do we get to the boy?

1:17:48.997 --> 1:17:49.831
- Heads up!

1:17:49.831 --> 1:17:52.000
(laughing)

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.377
- Hey, guys.

1:17:53.377 --> 1:17:54.836
Oh what's been going on?

1:17:54.836 --> 1:17:56.171
- Ain't shit.

1:17:56.171 --> 1:17:57.297
- Nothing?

1:17:57.297 --> 1:17:58.215
- Nothing.

1:17:58.215 --> 1:18:00.384
- Danny said you guys
have been catching up.

1:18:00.384 --> 1:18:01.301
- Oh, did he?

1:18:01.301 --> 1:18:02.844
What else did Danny tell you?

1:18:02.844 --> 1:18:05.722
- Just, it's better not to ask.

1:18:05.722 --> 1:18:06.556
- It is better.

1:18:07.974 --> 1:18:11.645
- The group here just
wanted to hear it firsthand.

1:18:12.688 --> 1:18:15.524
- Do I have to be
excluded from everything?

1:18:15.524 --> 1:18:16.608
We have history.

1:18:17.067 --> 1:18:19.861
- Look, if you're out, you're out, okay?

1:18:21.154 --> 1:18:21.988
- You happy?

1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:29.871
- [Chris] She's going to be charged.

1:18:30.622 --> 1:18:31.790
- Wait, what?

1:18:31.790 --> 1:18:33.375
- [Chris] Yeah, they're tapping her cell.

1:18:33.375 --> 1:18:34.710
The cops are sure Molly did it.

1:18:34.710 --> 1:18:35.877
- Oh my god.

1:18:35.877 --> 1:18:37.254
- How you know all this?

1:18:37.254 --> 1:18:39.339
- I'm addicted to the net.

1:18:39.339 --> 1:18:41.425
- Yo, dog, we could use you on this team.

1:18:41.425 --> 1:18:43.051
- [Chris] So it is a team?

1:18:43.051 --> 1:18:44.428
- You weren't supposed to make a link.

1:18:44.428 --> 1:18:45.887
- I was using a public computer.

1:18:45.887 --> 1:18:47.973
Besides, I routed it through 10 countries.

1:18:48.223 --> 1:18:49.725
- It doesn't matter, there
could have been cameras.

1:18:49.725 --> 1:18:51.309
You have no right.

1:18:51.309 --> 1:18:53.770
- That's what I came here to talk about.

1:18:53.770 --> 1:18:56.022
I've been doing a lot of
thinking since we last spoke.

1:18:56.022 --> 1:18:57.774
- Oh yeah, really, since yesterday?

1:18:59.359 --> 1:19:00.193
- Let me run that back.

1:19:00.444 --> 1:19:01.903
Um, you saw Chris yesterday?

1:19:03.071 --> 1:19:05.198
- [Danny] He's not
allowed out of the house

1:19:05.198 --> 1:19:07.284
unless it's with someone
his parents trust.

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:09.661
- Okay so then, you're in skeet machine.

1:19:09.661 --> 1:19:11.371
- Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah.

1:19:11.371 --> 1:19:12.205
No, not so fast.

1:19:12.205 --> 1:19:14.040
- Let me in, Danny.

1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:15.083
Now what do I have to do?

1:19:15.083 --> 1:19:16.710
- Not much.

1:19:16.710 --> 1:19:18.336
Just gotta stick you like a pig.

1:19:18.336 --> 1:19:20.672
- It doesn't matter, just show me, please.

1:19:20.672 --> 1:19:21.923
- Yeah, okay.

1:19:21.923 --> 1:19:22.758
So there--

1:19:22.758 --> 1:19:24.217
- Guys.

1:19:24.217 --> 1:19:26.678
This is official JD business.

1:19:26.678 --> 1:19:27.846
We cannot do this here.

1:19:29.014 --> 1:19:30.056
Let's get back to HQ.

1:19:30.807 --> 1:19:32.100
- HQ?

1:19:32.100 --> 1:19:32.934
- Come on.

1:19:42.861 --> 1:19:44.237
- Stop playing with it.

1:19:44.237 --> 1:19:45.739
- Why did you let Marko do it?

1:19:46.698 --> 1:19:48.909
- So this is definitely
Toby's new address?

1:19:48.909 --> 1:19:50.410
- 100 percent.

1:19:50.410 --> 1:19:51.369
It was easy.

1:19:51.369 --> 1:19:53.330
- I'm sure it was easy, big mouth.

1:19:54.623 --> 1:19:56.875
- Sorry, but she asked

1:19:56.875 --> 1:19:58.293
and nobody told me not to.

1:19:58.293 --> 1:20:00.003
How was I supposed to know that?

1:20:00.003 --> 1:20:00.629
- So?

1:20:02.088 --> 1:20:04.216
- Approved and slightly improved.

1:20:08.637 --> 1:20:09.513
- I don't like it.

1:20:09.513 --> 1:20:10.972
- But Chris said that the other patient

1:20:10.972 --> 1:20:13.016
is cleared to leave at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

1:20:13.016 --> 1:20:14.142
- I know what he said.

1:20:15.811 --> 1:20:18.939
- Hmm, it's a good thing
scrutinizer says yes, huh?

1:20:18.939 --> 1:20:20.106
- Yes, thank you.

1:20:21.149 --> 1:20:22.901
So, are we gonna do it?

1:20:28.615 --> 1:20:30.784
(sighing)

1:20:32.410 --> 1:20:35.163
(birds chirping)

1:20:37.999 --> 1:20:39.125
- This is stupid.

1:20:39.125 --> 1:20:40.961
Why do we have to do all this?

1:20:40.961 --> 1:20:42.712
- Every hospital has CCTV.

1:20:42.712 --> 1:20:44.339
There's cameras in there.

1:20:44.339 --> 1:20:45.757
You wanna show your face?

1:20:48.593 --> 1:20:50.554
- Fine, okay.

1:20:50.554 --> 1:20:52.097
Let's do it.

1:21:01.106 --> 1:21:03.108
- You shouldn't be here.

1:21:05.068 --> 1:21:07.404
It's too dangerous.

1:21:07.404 --> 1:21:09.239
I need you to be free.

1:21:09.239 --> 1:21:11.283
- But I had to see you, Molly.

1:21:11.283 --> 1:21:12.993
I feel horrible for what I've done to you.

1:21:12.993 --> 1:21:15.078
- No, it's what I wanted.

1:21:15.787 --> 1:21:17.247
- What's your take on things?

1:21:20.041 --> 1:21:21.126
- Not good.

1:21:21.126 --> 1:21:23.295
- Molly, you can't go to jail.

1:21:23.295 --> 1:21:24.713
It's not fair.

1:21:24.713 --> 1:21:26.715
It's my fault, okay?

1:21:26.715 --> 1:21:28.049
I need you in my life, okay?

1:21:28.049 --> 1:21:31.845
- No, what happened to
you girls is not fair.

1:21:31.845 --> 1:21:32.929
I'd take jail

1:21:32.929 --> 1:21:34.431
over that house of horrors.

1:21:35.223 --> 1:21:36.725
- Molly, what girls?

1:21:36.725 --> 1:21:37.559
- Oh no.

1:21:39.185 --> 1:21:40.604
I can't, I can't.

1:21:42.397 --> 1:21:44.357
- Then we're staying.

1:21:44.357 --> 1:21:46.151
- Please, Sarah.

1:21:46.151 --> 1:21:47.569
You have to go.

1:21:51.156 --> 1:21:54.117
I found Penelope on the internet

1:21:54.117 --> 1:21:55.285
and she's with God now.

1:21:57.203 --> 1:21:59.205
And I don't know anything else about it.

1:22:00.582 --> 1:22:01.875
- [Sarah] And what about the others?

1:22:04.210 --> 1:22:05.462
- There's only one other.

1:22:07.005 --> 1:22:07.839
- Go on.

1:22:09.674 --> 1:22:13.845
- Well, she may be the
reason I'm not in jail.

1:22:15.764 --> 1:22:17.599
- She's your lawyer?

1:22:17.599 --> 1:22:18.433
- Not quite.

1:22:20.393 --> 1:22:22.270
She's prosecuting the case.

1:22:24.522 --> 1:22:25.732
- [Danny] We need to go.

1:22:26.733 --> 1:22:28.026
- I didn't tell her anything.

1:22:28.026 --> 1:22:29.778
She's a victim too.
- She can't know.

1:22:29.778 --> 1:22:31.279
- I understand.
- They'll put us in jail.

1:22:31.279 --> 1:22:32.113
- [Danny] Sarah.

1:22:32.113 --> 1:22:33.490
- I'll never let that happen.

1:22:33.490 --> 1:22:34.449
- Sarah, now.

1:22:35.492 --> 1:22:36.660
- [Woman] Hey!

1:22:38.036 --> 1:22:40.705
(pensive music)

1:22:58.181 --> 1:22:59.224
- Sarah, stop.

1:22:59.224 --> 1:23:00.725
Sarah, just walk normally.

1:23:02.477 --> 1:23:04.437
She seems rock solid.

1:23:04.437 --> 1:23:06.731
- There were other girls, Danny.

1:23:06.731 --> 1:23:09.693
There were other girls and now
one of them is fucking dead!

1:23:12.278 --> 1:23:14.114
You have no idea what he did to them.

1:23:15.198 --> 1:23:16.282
How he made them feel.

1:23:18.535 --> 1:23:20.286
How he damaged those poor little girls

1:23:20.286 --> 1:23:22.789
with no fathers to protect them.

1:23:24.332 --> 1:23:28.586
It's not fair, it's not
fucking fair, it's not fair!

1:23:29.629 --> 1:23:31.798
(sobbing)

1:23:43.018 --> 1:23:44.519
- I'm sorry, Sarah.

1:23:49.774 --> 1:23:51.317
I wish I could have been there.

1:23:54.487 --> 1:23:55.613
I wish I could do more.

1:23:59.284 --> 1:24:01.202
- I think we did all we could to Frank.

1:24:04.914 --> 1:24:08.418
Can you believe she's a cop, our cop?

1:24:09.753 --> 1:24:10.754
- It's unbelievable.

1:24:14.924 --> 1:24:17.510
- I hope Penelope died peacefully.

1:24:18.887 --> 1:24:21.014
- Yeah, I'm sure she did.

1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:24.434
- It's okay, Danny.

1:24:25.018 --> 1:24:26.853
You can tell me what you really think.

1:24:29.522 --> 1:24:30.356
I'm not a baby.

1:24:31.441 --> 1:24:33.610
I know how this world
works more than most.

1:24:40.700 --> 1:24:43.453
You know not every scar is visible.

1:24:48.208 --> 1:24:50.460
- Ugh, how fitting.

1:24:51.336 --> 1:24:53.421
that scumbag definitely lives in there

1:24:57.258 --> 1:25:00.053
- I don't know about all
this voting stuff, guys.

1:25:00.053 --> 1:25:02.180
We should not be here during the daylight.

1:25:03.098 --> 1:25:04.641
- Look, everyone's at work.

1:25:04.641 --> 1:25:07.018
Besides, real estate
operates during the day.

1:25:07.018 --> 1:25:08.561
No one's gonna expect anything.

1:25:13.691 --> 1:25:15.110
- I don't like it.

1:25:15.110 --> 1:25:17.070
But stick to the plan.

1:25:17.070 --> 1:25:19.155
- 60 seconds, then I'm in.

1:25:23.827 --> 1:25:24.786
Need a push?

1:25:29.332 --> 1:25:30.542
- No.

1:25:30.542 --> 1:25:31.376
- Go on.

1:25:34.963 --> 1:25:36.464
(tense music)

1:25:36.464 --> 1:25:38.424
(knocking)

1:25:38.967 --> 1:25:39.884
- Yeah, it's open.

1:25:43.138 --> 1:25:45.974
Hey, when are they gonna
fix that fucking front door?

1:25:45.974 --> 1:25:47.517
Anyone could just walk in here.

1:25:49.519 --> 1:25:50.770
- I'll make a note of it.

1:25:51.688 --> 1:25:54.607
I'm Anthony from the agency.

1:25:54.607 --> 1:25:55.692
- Yeah, get on with it.

1:25:55.692 --> 1:25:57.068
Haven't got all fucking day.

1:26:01.114 --> 1:26:02.740
- You're the registered tenant?

1:26:04.033 --> 1:26:05.869
- Yeah, what of it?

1:26:07.495 --> 1:26:09.622
- I.I.Just need to take a quick look around.

1:26:11.624 --> 1:26:13.585
- No fucking chance, pal.

1:26:13.585 --> 1:26:15.086
Not without a warrant.

1:26:16.087 --> 1:26:18.673
- [Danny] This is just
a rental inspection.

1:26:18.673 --> 1:26:20.008
- What is this, kindergarten cops?

1:26:20.008 --> 1:26:21.634
Get the fuck out of here!

1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:28.391
- That's a fair few tough
guy stickers you got there.

1:26:28.391 --> 1:26:29.309
You a tough guy?

1:26:31.394 --> 1:26:33.396
- Yeah I'm a tough guy.

1:26:33.396 --> 1:26:35.148
You want some of this, kid?

1:26:35.148 --> 1:26:36.274
- Nah.

1:26:36.274 --> 1:26:37.650
We got one of those as well.

1:26:39.485 --> 1:26:40.403
- What the?

1:26:41.654 --> 1:26:42.447
Ugh!

1:26:48.369 --> 1:26:50.788
- Not exactly to the plan, but nice touch.

1:26:53.875 --> 1:26:54.709
Hey.

1:26:55.627 --> 1:26:56.461
- Hey.

1:26:56.461 --> 1:26:57.754
- [Danny] I was just coming to get you.

1:26:57.754 --> 1:27:00.548
- Yeah, me and Lin were
gonna go to the beach.

1:27:00.548 --> 1:27:01.549
- Good idea.

1:27:03.635 --> 1:27:04.469
You okay?

1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:08.640
- You know demons in dungeons
don't scare me anymore.

1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:10.934
Now that the ones from
my nightmares are gone.

1:27:13.019 --> 1:27:14.520
- We're the good guys here, right?

1:27:16.314 --> 1:27:17.106
- I think so.

1:27:19.609 --> 1:27:23.613
Danny, stop trying to look
for perfection in everything.

1:27:31.287 --> 1:27:32.330
Including me.

1:27:34.624 --> 1:27:35.625
-[Nick] My lady

1:27:35.875 --> 1:27:37.710
- [Lin] I'm not your fucking maid.

1:27:37.710 --> 1:27:39.212
- Well not with that attitude.

1:27:40.421 --> 1:27:41.589
What the fuck?

1:27:43.341 --> 1:27:44.592
Hey, over here.

1:27:44.592 --> 1:27:46.511
I just want to let you
know that I'm super hyped,

1:27:46.511 --> 1:27:47.929
that we're gonna make him
chop out his own tattoo,

1:27:47.929 --> 1:27:50.348
like oh my god, what, that's lit.

1:27:50.348 --> 1:27:53.059
- It's kind of horrific, but yeah.

1:27:53.059 --> 1:27:55.228
It's a fitting tribute to a good father.

1:27:55.228 --> 1:27:57.730
And it's a message to
those who prey on others

1:27:57.730 --> 1:27:58.564
that we're here now

1:27:58.564 --> 1:28:01.150
and we're not weak.

1:28:01.150 --> 1:28:01.985
- (mumbled) Oh my God.

1:28:01.985 --> 1:28:03.361
Look, we're not weak, all right?

1:28:03.361 --> 1:28:04.487
We're the motherfucking JDs.

1:28:04.487 --> 1:28:05.613
Look, look, look at that shit.

1:28:05.613 --> 1:28:06.447
Wanna see it, wanna kiss it?

1:28:06.447 --> 1:28:07.991
Kiss it, just on the tongue.

1:28:07.991 --> 1:28:08.825
Right here, right, come on

1:28:08.825 --> 1:28:09.993
you wanna tongue me down?

1:28:09.993 --> 1:28:11.035
Muscle?

1:28:11.035 --> 1:28:11.869
Look, look.

1:28:13.329 --> 1:28:14.330
Look, here, you get in the shit too,

1:28:14.330 --> 1:28:15.456
JDs for fucking ever then.

1:28:15.456 --> 1:28:17.375
- Yeah, sharp edge
of the sword, brother.

1:28:17.375 --> 1:28:19.043
JDs forever.

1:28:19.043 --> 1:28:19.877
- Forever.

1:28:19.877 --> 1:28:23.089
- Well, I'm not weak either, forever.

1:28:23.089 --> 1:28:24.132
- Ooh.

1:28:24.132 --> 1:28:25.466
(laughing)

1:28:25.466 --> 1:28:26.342
- JDs forever.

1:28:26.342 --> 1:28:29.012
- Oh man, look at those bad boys.

1:28:30.138 --> 1:28:31.514
-Allright

1:28:31.514 --> 1:28:34.392
- Oh, shut up. (laughing)

1:28:34.392 --> 1:28:35.893
- Go clean your bowl.

1:28:35.893 --> 1:28:38.187
- You better go clean
your bowl, princess.

1:28:38.187 --> 1:28:39.147
- Why are you always ruining the moment?

1:28:40.690 --> 1:28:43.192
- Don't you feel a little weird being here

1:28:43.192 --> 1:28:44.986
and them inside?

1:28:46.821 --> 1:28:48.573
- I mean it's either here or there.

1:28:50.908 --> 1:28:51.743
- Yeah.

1:28:55.913 --> 1:28:58.416
(tense music)

1:29:06.716 --> 1:29:08.301
- Why are you doing this?

1:29:08.301 --> 1:29:10.595
- [Nick] Shh, no, no,
no, no, shut up, listen.

1:29:11.679 --> 1:29:12.513
- See that clock?

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:18.227
What we're about to do
will be repeated every day,

1:29:18.227 --> 1:29:20.271
twice a day.

1:29:20.271 --> 1:29:23.316
First shift at 10, second at five

1:29:23.316 --> 1:29:25.485
till you give us what we want.

1:29:25.485 --> 1:29:26.319
- I don't have anything.

1:29:26.319 --> 1:29:28.321
Whatever you want, it's yours.

1:29:28.321 --> 1:29:29.947
- That's good.

1:29:29.947 --> 1:29:30.782
Covers about half.

1:29:31.115 --> 1:29:31.949
- Take it.

1:29:33.701 --> 1:29:35.536
- I wouldn't be so quick to offer up.

1:29:37.246 --> 1:29:38.790
- What's the other half?

1:29:38.790 --> 1:29:42.168
- A confession for the
murder of your ex, Jess.

1:29:42.168 --> 1:29:43.378
- Fuck you.

1:29:43.378 --> 1:29:45.713
I didn't kill that crazy chink ass nigger.

1:29:45.713 --> 1:29:47.548
(bashing)

1:29:47.548 --> 1:29:48.549
(groaning)

1:29:48.549 --> 1:29:50.343
- Ooh, oh man!

1:29:50.343 --> 1:29:52.678
Somebody's showing their
true colors, aren't they?

1:29:54.806 --> 1:29:56.099
Hey you peep this,

1:29:56.099 --> 1:29:59.102
looks like we got ourselves a believer.

1:29:59.102 --> 1:30:00.103
- Excellent.

1:30:02.772 --> 1:30:05.733
- So, just for a better
understanding for me,

1:30:05.733 --> 1:30:09.153
was she only allowed in for
the fucking, is that it huh?

1:30:09.153 --> 1:30:10.446
Was that it, 'cause I mean,

1:30:10.446 --> 1:30:12.240
me and him, two guys like us,

1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:14.617
we understand how the system works.

1:30:14.617 --> 1:30:16.494
- Why are you doing this?

1:30:16.494 --> 1:30:18.996
She was a fucking crack whore.

1:30:19.872 --> 1:30:21.040
- [Nick] Oh, she was.

1:30:22.708 --> 1:30:25.670
(groaning)

1:30:25.670 --> 1:30:26.754
Motherfucker!

1:30:27.964 --> 1:30:29.173
Ooh, goddamit.

1:30:29.173 --> 1:30:30.550
Look, look, look, look what you did.

1:30:30.550 --> 1:30:33.094
Look, you made me hurt my hand.

1:30:33.094 --> 1:30:34.720
Shit, ugh!

1:30:36.472 --> 1:30:38.516
(groaning)

1:30:38.516 --> 1:30:40.017
- Take it, whatever you want.

1:30:41.436 --> 1:30:44.272
- We don't want your crusty
ass recliner douchebag.

1:30:44.272 --> 1:30:45.231
- What do you want?

1:30:50.278 --> 1:30:54.115
- Say, quarter inch of
skin around that tattoo.

1:30:57.410 --> 1:30:58.244
See this knife?

1:31:00.288 --> 1:31:02.165
Goes right there.

1:31:02.165 --> 1:31:05.460
Unless, using it for that.

1:31:05.460 --> 1:31:07.044
Anything else, okay,

1:31:09.964 --> 1:31:11.799
you'll regret that, I'll make sure of it.

1:31:12.842 --> 1:31:14.552
- I can't confess.

1:31:14.552 --> 1:31:16.095
I won't confess.

1:31:16.095 --> 1:31:18.639
I didn't do anything wrong to confess.

1:31:18.639 --> 1:31:20.641
- Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay.

1:31:20.641 --> 1:31:21.851
Calm down, shh.

1:31:25.313 --> 1:31:26.147
We wouldn't let you confess

1:31:26.147 --> 1:31:27.482
on the first go-round anyways right?

1:31:29.400 --> 1:31:31.068
- [Marko] Who's first?

1:31:31.068 --> 1:31:32.111
I'll flip you for it.

1:31:34.447 --> 1:31:35.573
- [Nick] Heads.

1:31:35.573 --> 1:31:37.825
(groaning)

1:31:41.913 --> 1:31:44.081
(bashing)

1:31:49.754 --> 1:31:54.175
(bashing)
(groaning)

1:31:57.303 --> 1:31:58.804
- You really wanna uncuff him?

1:32:01.599 --> 1:32:03.601
- [Marko] Do the other arm.

1:32:03.601 --> 1:32:04.560
- That's even stupider.

1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:05.603
- [Marko] Just do it.

1:32:22.828 --> 1:32:23.663
(Toby screaming)

1:32:23.663 --> 1:32:24.956
- Oh fuck!

1:32:27.583 --> 1:32:31.003
You just ninja'd his arm in fucking half!

1:32:32.755 --> 1:32:35.007
- [Marko] Give me that arm.

1:32:39.387 --> 1:32:40.221
- Good talk.

1:32:42.765 --> 1:32:44.600
How's he supposed to cut
himself out now, huh?

1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:46.644
- He's the master race, he'll figure it out.

1:32:48.688 --> 1:32:49.897
- [Danny] Lot of noise down there, boys.

1:32:49.897 --> 1:32:52.024
- [Marko] Yeah, everything's as requested.

1:32:53.734 --> 1:32:57.113
- Scrutinized and improvised.

1:32:58.114 --> 1:32:58.948
Check it.

1:32:58.948 --> 1:32:59.907
(inaudible whisper)

1:33:03.327 --> 1:33:04.161
- I heard you.

1:33:10.501 --> 1:33:12.295
- Just find something we can use.

1:33:12.295 --> 1:33:13.879
- [Ryker] No doubt.

1:33:20.344 --> 1:33:21.596
- Nah, That's too much.

1:33:22.638 --> 1:33:23.598
- [Ryker] Says you.

1:33:36.068 --> 1:33:40.573
- All right, drop the knife
and we won't use the pole.

1:33:41.490 --> 1:33:42.408
Look, we're gonna whack that arm

1:33:42.408 --> 1:33:44.994
and the knife's gonna be
returned to us nonetheless.

1:33:47.288 --> 1:33:49.624
(screaming)

1:33:53.919 --> 1:33:55.379
Nowhere else but here.

1:33:57.006 --> 1:33:59.342
- [Toby] Why are you doing this to me?

1:33:59.383 --> 1:34:00.343
- You know why.

1:34:01.302 --> 1:34:03.429
How many days, well that's up to you.

1:34:04.639 --> 1:34:05.973
- [Toby] Fuck you!

1:34:06.015 --> 1:34:08.809
- No, fuck you, Toby.

1:34:10.978 --> 1:34:11.812
(bashing)

1:34:11.812 --> 1:34:14.148
(screaming)

1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:18.736
(sighing)

1:34:18.736 --> 1:34:20.946
- Sounds pretty bad, guys.

1:34:20.946 --> 1:34:22.698
- I know, I'm sorry.

1:34:25.534 --> 1:34:27.995
I just feel like it could
be over sooner than later.

1:34:27.995 --> 1:34:29.538
- What, what?

1:34:29.538 --> 1:34:31.499
It means it's me in the
betting pool tomorrow.

1:34:34.919 --> 1:34:35.753
If we had one

1:34:37.672 --> 1:34:38.506
which we don't.

1:34:40.883 --> 1:34:42.551
- We'll work on the noise.

1:34:42.551 --> 1:34:43.552
- Thank you.

1:34:44.679 --> 1:34:46.764
- [Nick] Ring ring, Toby.

1:34:51.894 --> 1:34:54.313
- Nah nah nah nah, I was
just trying to cut it out.

1:34:55.272 --> 1:34:57.066
- All right, well let's see what you got.

1:34:59.485 --> 1:35:00.569
Oh yeah I see.

1:35:02.154 --> 1:35:03.322
So this is good, right.

1:35:04.615 --> 1:35:06.617
But the thing is we
didn't bring you down here

1:35:06.617 --> 1:35:09.328
just so you can scribble
across this poor girl's name.

1:35:11.163 --> 1:35:11.997
See down here,

1:35:15.543 --> 1:35:16.669
you pay in flesh.

1:35:16.669 --> 1:35:18.963
(screaming)

1:35:20.381 --> 1:35:21.382
- [Marko] What the fuck, Nick!

1:35:21.424 --> 1:35:21.841
Stick to the script

1:35:21.841 --> 1:35:22.425
- Fucking gross.

1:35:23.259 --> 1:35:25.636
Did you just say my fucking name?

1:35:25.636 --> 1:35:26.554
- He's passed out, fuckwit.

1:35:26.554 --> 1:35:29.598
If you don't fix this shit,
he's probably gonna die.

1:35:29.598 --> 1:35:31.183
Get something to put his arm up.

1:35:35.229 --> 1:35:36.272
Hurry up,

1:35:38.649 --> 1:35:39.483
- [Nick] You said my fucking name

1:35:39.483 --> 1:35:42.236
- Shut up, fucking just get it done.

1:35:47.032 --> 1:35:48.159
Come on, get upstairs.

1:35:51.996 --> 1:35:53.205
Go, come on.

1:35:53.205 --> 1:35:55.583
- [Lin] Stop. (laughing)

1:35:55.583 --> 1:35:57.084
I'm slapping you.

1:35:57.084 --> 1:35:58.836
- Shut up.
- Oh, Sarah.

1:36:00.838 --> 1:36:01.672
- Yo.

1:36:01.672 --> 1:36:02.715
- Don't touch me again, you big ass ape!

1:36:02.715 --> 1:36:04.175
- You are out of control.

1:36:04.175 --> 1:36:05.509
- What's going on with y'all?

1:36:05.509 --> 1:36:07.636
- Your butt buddy here just
sliced open Toby's arm.

1:36:07.636 --> 1:36:09.305
- Yeah well this silverback
bitch just said my name

1:36:09.305 --> 1:36:10.139
in front of him!

1:36:10.139 --> 1:36:11.015
- Dude!

1:36:11.015 --> 1:36:12.141
- He was passed out.

1:36:12.141 --> 1:36:13.601
Besides, I had to tie his arm up,

1:36:13.601 --> 1:36:15.352
otherwise he would have bled to death.

1:36:19.982 --> 1:36:21.942
- What y'all looking at, huh?

1:36:21.942 --> 1:36:24.069
No, look, it's the rules
of war out here, all right?

1:36:26.030 --> 1:36:26.864
I don't know what the fuck y'all think

1:36:26.864 --> 1:36:27.698
we're doing here!

1:36:34.914 --> 1:36:37.291
- I'm gonna go after him, let me.

1:36:42.963 --> 1:36:44.340
- It's not right, guys.

1:36:45.591 --> 1:36:47.051
There's always gonna be blood.

1:36:49.637 --> 1:36:50.429
We need a medic.

1:36:51.514 --> 1:36:52.515
- Don't look at me.

1:36:52.515 --> 1:36:54.183
Your nurse just ran out the door.

1:36:57.394 --> 1:36:58.354
- Anyone opposed?

1:37:01.232 --> 1:37:02.691
I'm gonna go check the damage.

1:37:03.734 --> 1:37:04.568
- His arm?

1:37:08.572 --> 1:37:11.283
(birds chirping)

1:37:19.291 --> 1:37:20.960
- Hey man, when we gonna
see your mom again?

1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:23.045
- Yeah I'm not going to lie, your mom is pretty hot.

1:37:23.045 --> 1:37:24.046
- Oh my god.

1:37:26.298 --> 1:37:27.508
- What up, assholes?

1:37:28.801 --> 1:37:29.635
- Where's Lin?

1:37:30.553 --> 1:37:32.054
- I don't know, she ain't come with me.

1:37:37.768 --> 1:37:39.395
- You take my shift.

1:37:39.395 --> 1:37:40.521
- Yeah, okay.

1:37:40.563 --> 1:37:41.397
- Let's go.

1:37:42.231 --> 1:37:43.899
- Hey wait, does that mean I got dinner?

1:37:45.943 --> 1:37:46.777
Switch?

1:37:46.777 --> 1:37:48.404
(laughing)

1:37:50.406 --> 1:37:53.325
(mumbling singing)

1:37:54.994 --> 1:37:55.828
- Lin!

1:37:57.830 --> 1:37:58.664
Hey, hey.

1:38:00.207 --> 1:38:01.041
Hey.

1:38:01.917 --> 1:38:03.836
Are you okay?

1:38:03.836 --> 1:38:05.588
- [Danny] What are you doing to us?

1:38:06.422 --> 1:38:08.716
- I'll take care of her, okay?

1:38:09.633 --> 1:38:12.303
- I can't do this shit again.

1:38:12.303 --> 1:38:13.596
I grew up with this.

1:38:13.596 --> 1:38:14.722
- Well you can't just discard her

1:38:14.722 --> 1:38:16.724
because she's having a hard time.

1:38:16.724 --> 1:38:19.768
We're not all barbarians
like Nick, you know.

1:38:19.768 --> 1:38:20.936
I'll fix this.

1:38:20.936 --> 1:38:22.313
I'll fix it.

1:38:22.313 --> 1:38:23.147
- It's on you.

1:38:24.899 --> 1:38:26.442
You gotta get yourself together.

1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:30.821
- Hey, you take care of your troops

1:38:30.821 --> 1:38:32.156
and I'll take care of mine.

1:38:36.327 --> 1:38:37.912
Hey, okay.

1:38:39.955 --> 1:38:41.206
- Sorry.

1:38:41.206 --> 1:38:42.166
- It's okay.

1:38:43.334 --> 1:38:44.543
It's all right, it's just us now.

1:38:44.543 --> 1:38:47.129
- [Lin] I meant to tell you, I promise.

1:38:47.129 --> 1:38:48.672
- I know.

1:38:48.672 --> 1:38:50.174
I know you did.

1:38:50.174 --> 1:38:52.134
- [Lin] I can't go back there, I can't,

1:38:52.134 --> 1:38:53.636
I'm sorry, I'm sorry Sarah.

1:38:53.636 --> 1:38:55.304
- Yes you can.

1:38:55.304 --> 1:38:56.472
- No I can't, I'm not fit for this stuff.

1:38:56.472 --> 1:38:58.098
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:38:58.098 --> 1:38:59.475
- You don't have to, okay?

1:38:59.475 --> 1:39:00.601
You don't have to, Lin.

1:39:00.601 --> 1:39:01.936
I have some good news.

1:39:01.936 --> 1:39:04.063
- What?

1:39:04.063 --> 1:39:06.440
- Well we all decided
on making you the medic.

1:39:08.275 --> 1:39:09.276
-Why?

1:39:10.319 --> 1:39:11.820
-Because we love you

1:39:12.780 --> 1:39:15.407
and we all think that you're
the brave and smart one.

1:39:20.204 --> 1:39:22.998
- I mean I am the brave and smart one.

1:39:22.998 --> 1:39:24.333
- Yeah.

1:39:37.972 --> 1:39:39.306
Eggs?

1:39:39.306 --> 1:39:40.349
- Chef Nick.

1:39:41.767 --> 1:39:43.894
- Oh, after dinner,

1:39:43.894 --> 1:39:46.480
I need you to teach me
how to use the camera.

1:39:46.480 --> 1:39:48.565
- [Sarah] No, that's my gig.

1:39:49.733 --> 1:39:50.734
- Not anymore.

1:39:51.860 --> 1:39:53.570
Look, if you go down there

1:39:53.570 --> 1:39:54.989
and he can smell the fear on you

1:39:54.989 --> 1:39:56.156
then the whole confession just goes

1:39:56.156 --> 1:39:57.324
out the window, all right?

1:39:57.324 --> 1:39:59.868
- He's ready for
a confession already?

1:39:59.868 --> 1:40:01.787
- [Ryker] Marko convinced him.

1:40:01.787 --> 1:40:02.913
- How you do that?

1:40:02.913 --> 1:40:04.456
- I said remove Jess's name

1:40:04.456 --> 1:40:05.624
or I'm gonna fillet each one of those

1:40:05.624 --> 1:40:06.750
tattoos from your body.

1:40:07.251 --> 1:40:08.335
- You could do that?

1:40:08.502 --> 1:40:10.629
- [Marko] Fuck'd if I know but
he definitely thought I could.

1:40:10.671 --> 1:40:13.007
(chuckling)

1:40:14.758 --> 1:40:16.844
- Look, you're not ready.

1:40:18.137 --> 1:40:19.388
- I'm not teaching you.

1:40:19.388 --> 1:40:20.556
- Give it a break, man.

1:40:21.807 --> 1:40:24.685
- Sending the girls down there
is a bad idea, all right?

1:40:24.685 --> 1:40:26.395
- Well it's her job to give away,

1:40:26.395 --> 1:40:28.063
not the other way around.

1:40:29.314 --> 1:40:30.983
- Scrutinizer says no.

1:40:30.983 --> 1:40:32.568
Anything goes wrong, that's on you.

1:40:32.568 --> 1:40:33.402
- Fine.

1:40:34.486 --> 1:40:37.156
(ominous music)

1:40:57.301 --> 1:40:59.136
Nobody should see this.

1:40:59.136 --> 1:41:00.596
- Yeah, the shit looks like oysters.

1:41:02.014 --> 1:41:03.515
- Just make sure it's all off.

1:41:14.068 --> 1:41:15.110
- It's gone.

1:41:16.236 --> 1:41:17.071
It's gone.

1:41:22.326 --> 1:41:23.952
(knocking)

1:41:26.163 --> 1:41:27.623
- [Danny] Comes with the job.

1:41:28.832 --> 1:41:30.959
All right, you need to
wash all that perfume off

1:41:30.959 --> 1:41:33.212
and all of this goes.

1:41:33.921 --> 1:41:35.380
- Okay.

1:41:35.798 --> 1:41:37.966
- [Danny] Hide those with this.

1:41:40.052 --> 1:41:40.886
And put these on.

1:41:44.515 --> 1:41:46.308
It's best for the JDs.

1:41:46.308 --> 1:41:48.435
Not a single word from your mouth

1:41:48.435 --> 1:41:49.686
no matter what.

1:41:49.686 --> 1:41:50.521
Promise?

1:41:50.562 --> 1:41:51.438
- I promise.

1:41:52.940 --> 1:41:54.066
- [Danny] Starting now.

1:41:57.945 --> 1:41:59.780
We need to do some repair work first.

1:42:32.229 --> 1:42:33.272
Make him talk.

1:42:34.690 --> 1:42:35.524
- No.

1:42:35.524 --> 1:42:36.900
- [Danny] Hey, wait.

1:42:38.402 --> 1:42:39.361
Not the face.

1:42:40.737 --> 1:42:42.531
Take the jacket off.

1:42:42.573 --> 1:42:43.991
Squeeze his arm.

1:42:44.032 --> 1:42:44.867
- No, no.

1:42:45.242 --> 1:42:46.827
No, no, no, no, no.

1:42:49.037 --> 1:42:51.123
No, please don't do that.

1:42:52.541 --> 1:42:57.546
No, (screaming)

1:42:57.546 --> 1:42:59.965
(whimpering)

1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:06.388
- This continues till the end.

1:43:08.724 --> 1:43:09.766
Stop crying!

1:43:13.228 --> 1:43:14.229
The choice is yours.

1:43:15.564 --> 1:43:18.650
Medical attention or your
next scheduled appointment.

1:43:26.116 --> 1:43:27.492
- Turn the camera on.

1:43:33.165 --> 1:43:35.292
I killed my fiancee Jess

1:43:37.878 --> 1:43:40.881
'cause she was gonna leave me.

1:43:47.512 --> 1:43:50.682
I punched her in the stomach.

1:43:50.682 --> 1:43:54.436
She tried to scream but, she couldn't.

1:43:57.022 --> 1:43:58.190
She couldn't breathe.

1:44:01.151 --> 1:44:02.444
That's when I stabbed her.

1:44:05.197 --> 1:44:06.114
I freaked.

1:44:08.992 --> 1:44:09.868
I was high.

1:44:12.079 --> 1:44:13.247
I was smoking all day.

1:44:16.250 --> 1:44:18.293
I even blew smoke down her lungs

1:44:18.293 --> 1:44:19.795
as she lay there gasping.

1:44:25.717 --> 1:44:26.760
I got away with it.

1:44:27.970 --> 1:44:31.139
Think the cops wanna
solve something like this?

1:44:31.139 --> 1:44:32.808
Think they give a fuck about some

1:44:34.851 --> 1:44:36.770
crackhead in the neighborhood?

1:44:39.982 --> 1:44:40.816
I'm sorry.

1:44:42.192 --> 1:44:43.026
I'm sorry.

1:45:05.048 --> 1:45:06.675
- What's wrong?

1:45:06.675 --> 1:45:08.051
- Did that just happen?

1:45:08.051 --> 1:45:09.011
- I think so.

1:45:09.011 --> 1:45:10.554
- I was not expecting that.

1:45:10.554 --> 1:45:11.972
- He sung like a bird you guys.

1:45:11.972 --> 1:45:13.307
We fucking got him.

1:45:13.307 --> 1:45:15.100
- Oh my god.

1:45:15.100 --> 1:45:16.643
- The shit he went into.

1:45:18.770 --> 1:45:20.439
- Thanks for evening the score.

1:45:22.316 --> 1:45:23.275
- Holy shit.

1:45:23.984 --> 1:45:26.653
The fucking cops couldn't
do anything but we did, huh?

1:45:26.737 --> 1:45:28.071
- Yeah.

1:45:28.238 --> 1:45:29.448
We got 'em, dickhead.

1:45:36.997 --> 1:45:38.540
- One day.

1:45:38.665 --> 1:45:40.167
- Thanks, dickhead.

1:45:40.167 --> 1:45:42.419
(laughing)

1:45:45.172 --> 1:45:47.382
- Yo, what the fuck?

1:45:47.507 --> 1:45:48.342
Who did it?

1:45:50.052 --> 1:45:51.053
(mumbling) I'll kill one of you mother...

1:45:51.136 --> 1:45:54.097
- Yeah no, we don't handle
internal jobs, sorry.

1:45:55.098 --> 1:45:57.184
- And you gotta follow the rules.

1:45:57.601 --> 1:45:59.394
- I only promised to keep my mouth shut.

1:45:59.478 --> 1:46:01.730
- Yeah, but now he knows
there's a girl in the group.

1:46:01.730 --> 1:46:02.814
- You wanna bet?

1:46:02.814 --> 1:46:04.149
- I wouldn't do that.

1:46:05.359 --> 1:46:06.568
- All right, Lin.

1:46:06.568 --> 1:46:07.986
This is where you come in.

1:46:07.986 --> 1:46:08.820
- You need me already?

1:46:08.820 --> 1:46:10.739
I've only read five pages.

1:46:10.739 --> 1:46:14.076
- Yeah well, that's five
more than any of us.

1:46:14.076 --> 1:46:16.995
Don't worry, Ryker and Nick
will be there for security.

1:46:16.995 --> 1:46:18.330
- I'm not scared, Danny,

1:46:18.330 --> 1:46:20.415
I just, I don't know what I'm doing.

1:46:20.415 --> 1:46:22.042
- Well how much time do you need?

1:46:22.042 --> 1:46:24.169
- About six years is the usual?

1:46:24.169 --> 1:46:26.713
I mean look at the size of this book.

1:46:26.713 --> 1:46:28.006
- Right.

1:46:28.006 --> 1:46:29.383
You've got 60 minutes.

1:46:29.383 --> 1:46:30.926
Look, just do what you can

1:46:30.926 --> 1:46:33.345
and start by learning about broken arms.

1:46:33.345 --> 1:46:35.680
- You gotta be fucking
kidding me, broken arms?

1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:38.016
- I believe in you, all right?

1:46:38.016 --> 1:46:39.851
Just write down the list
of everything you need.

1:46:41.895 --> 1:46:42.729
- Okay.

1:46:43.772 --> 1:46:46.525
(birds chirping)

1:46:51.238 --> 1:46:52.072
- Hmph.

1:46:52.447 --> 1:46:53.323
Great security.

1:47:11.967 --> 1:47:12.801
You ready?

1:47:12.801 --> 1:47:13.969
- Not really.

1:47:19.599 --> 1:47:20.392
- You're ready.

1:47:25.188 --> 1:47:31.278
(Toby whimpering)

1:47:41.872 --> 1:47:44.541
(Toby groaning)

1:47:55.635 --> 1:47:58.263
- [Lin] And my favorite.

1:47:58.263 --> 1:48:02.017
- Wow, Lin.

1:48:02.017 --> 1:48:02.893
- You're welcome.

1:48:03.935 --> 1:48:05.770
- We're finally a family, you guys.

1:48:05.770 --> 1:48:07.314
- Yeah, a real family.

1:48:08.315 --> 1:48:10.609
Not born, but forged.

1:48:11.776 --> 1:48:13.069
- Familia.

1:48:13.069 --> 1:48:15.030
- [All] Familia.

1:48:15.030 --> 1:48:16.615
- [Lin] Okay.

1:48:16.615 --> 1:48:18.116
- From my side we say kin folk.

1:48:19.534 --> 1:48:20.869
- [All] Kin folk.

1:48:23.121 --> 1:48:24.623
- Oh wait, I got one.

1:48:24.623 --> 1:48:26.500
It's uh, what,

1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:28.126
- Still Asian.
- Yeah whatever.

1:48:29.461 --> 1:48:32.797
Ah, Suyya, that's what it's called.

1:48:32.797 --> 1:48:34.799
- [All] Suyyaa!

1:48:34.799 --> 1:48:37.427
- Okay Danny, your turn.

1:48:39.346 --> 1:48:42.265
- I mean, we just call it family.

1:48:43.266 --> 1:48:44.434
- Exotic.
- No shit.

1:48:44.434 --> 1:48:45.936
- So much thought on that one.

1:48:47.979 --> 1:48:49.481
So I guess we're like brothers now, huh?

1:48:49.481 --> 1:48:50.398
- Oh what?

1:48:50.398 --> 1:48:52.400
So I'm like the third half-cast now?

1:48:53.276 --> 1:48:54.361
- Fourth.

1:48:54.361 --> 1:48:55.445
- Settle down you two.

1:48:56.363 --> 1:48:57.697
Specially you, SPF5000.

1:48:58.573 --> 1:48:59.950
- Oh!

1:48:59.950 --> 1:49:01.576
- I'm third.

1:49:01.576 --> 1:49:03.578
She's fourth.

1:49:03.578 --> 1:49:04.412
You're fifth.

1:49:04.412 --> 1:49:07.541
- No, I'm fifth, you're sixth.

1:49:07.541 --> 1:49:09.251
- All right.

1:49:09.251 --> 1:49:11.378
Can't wait to tell brother Chris.

1:49:11.378 --> 1:49:12.712
- Brother Chris!

1:49:12.712 --> 1:49:13.547
(laughing)

1:49:13.547 --> 1:49:16.466
- And we take care of
our brothers, right boys?

1:49:16.466 --> 1:49:17.551
- Put the knife down, Sarah.

1:49:17.551 --> 1:49:18.385
- Please.

1:49:20.220 --> 1:49:21.096
- Okay.

1:49:21.096 --> 1:49:23.390
Then let's eat, come on.

1:49:23.390 --> 1:49:25.392
- Ooh, this looks so good.

1:49:35.694 --> 1:49:37.946
- You've got two weeks to be in jail.

1:49:39.030 --> 1:49:39.864
Not a day more.

1:49:43.451 --> 1:49:45.036
Got it?

1:49:45.036 --> 1:49:45.870
Yeah?

1:49:46.788 --> 1:49:48.415
We have to know you're on board.

1:49:50.208 --> 1:49:51.543
Now, you may wonder

1:49:52.419 --> 1:49:53.795
can the police use the tape?

1:49:54.713 --> 1:49:55.547
Who knows?

1:49:57.090 --> 1:50:00.051
What really matters is we
know who Toby Miller is

1:50:01.928 --> 1:50:03.430
and we know how to get to him.

1:50:03.430 --> 1:50:06.975
(Toby screaming)

1:50:07.475 --> 1:50:09.686
Tell anyone what happened here

1:50:09.686 --> 1:50:10.854
and we will find you.

1:50:12.772 --> 1:50:15.400
If you're ever in this chair again,

1:50:17.652 --> 1:50:19.154
we're just gonna have to pretend

1:50:19.154 --> 1:50:21.948
you have a tattoo on
your back, your belly,

1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:26.578
(bashing)
(screaming)

1:50:26.578 --> 1:50:27.829
and your balls!

1:50:31.916 --> 1:50:33.877
You only get to check out of here once.

1:50:36.004 --> 1:50:36.838
Company policy.

1:50:47.140 --> 1:50:48.350
(birds chirping)

1:50:49.434 --> 1:50:50.560
- What's going on, guys?

1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:51.603
- What's up, what's up?

1:50:51.603 --> 1:50:52.437
- What up?

1:50:52.437 --> 1:50:53.813
Ooh, planning our next adventure?

1:50:53.813 --> 1:50:55.440
- Nah.

1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:56.733
All quiet on the western front.

1:50:56.733 --> 1:50:58.610
The girls are just giving me grief.

1:50:58.610 --> 1:50:59.736
- [Marko] What about?

1:50:59.736 --> 1:51:00.737
- We wanna see Thomas.

1:51:00.737 --> 1:51:02.113
- Why?
- [Danny] Exactly.

1:51:02.113 --> 1:51:03.531
- Can't explain it, really.

1:51:03.531 --> 1:51:06.326
- And it's just from
a distance, that's it.

1:51:08.078 --> 1:51:09.829
What is that on your arm?

1:51:09.829 --> 1:51:11.414
- Please don't encourage him.

1:51:11.414 --> 1:51:12.666
- [Danny] What is it?

1:51:12.666 --> 1:51:13.541
- I'm glad you asked, Danny boy.

1:51:13.541 --> 1:51:16.419
Check it.

1:51:16.419 --> 1:51:17.253
Mmm.

1:51:17.253 --> 1:51:18.088
- JD?

1:51:18.088 --> 1:51:19.214
- Yep, bet your ass.

1:51:19.214 --> 1:51:20.340
100 percent stamped.

1:51:21.549 --> 1:51:22.801
- Branded, you mean.

1:51:22.801 --> 1:51:24.678
Might as well be a gang tattoo.

1:51:24.678 --> 1:51:27.597
- Relax, Danny, I think it looks good.

1:51:27.597 --> 1:51:28.682
Might get one myself.

1:51:29.933 --> 1:51:31.601
You're not my daddy.

1:51:31.601 --> 1:51:33.186
- Ink gets recorded.

1:51:33.186 --> 1:51:34.771
It goes on a database, and wham

1:51:34.771 --> 1:51:36.106
the police have their connection.

1:51:36.106 --> 1:51:37.315
Besides, look at the color.

1:51:37.315 --> 1:51:38.149
- What?

1:51:38.149 --> 1:51:40.026
It's supposed to be a symbol for kids

1:51:40.026 --> 1:51:42.821
who've gone through
child abuse, you douche.

1:51:42.821 --> 1:51:44.823
- I didn't know.

1:51:44.823 --> 1:51:46.866
- Well damn, you probably should.

1:51:46.866 --> 1:51:48.785
So, what's it gonna be?

1:51:48.785 --> 1:51:50.537
The ink or Thomas?

1:51:50.537 --> 1:51:52.038
- That's blackmail.

1:51:52.038 --> 1:51:53.123
- Yeah it is.

1:51:53.123 --> 1:51:55.083
Blackmail, kidnapping, torture.

1:51:55.083 --> 1:51:57.419
Isn't that what we do?

1:51:57.419 --> 1:51:58.545
I'm thinking about getting one of those

1:51:58.545 --> 1:51:59.546
right around here.

1:52:01.005 --> 1:52:02.257
- [Danny] See what you've done?

1:52:03.633 --> 1:52:05.385
- You ain't my daddy.

1:52:05.385 --> 1:52:06.803
- [Danny] Yeah, thank fuck for that.

1:52:06.803 --> 1:52:07.637
- Hey.

1:52:07.637 --> 1:52:08.471
- What?

1:52:08.471 --> 1:52:10.682
You don't even have the same dad.

1:52:10.682 --> 1:52:11.766
What's the other one?

1:52:12.767 --> 1:52:15.145
- (laughing) Glad you
asked about that one too.

1:52:16.688 --> 1:52:17.522
Look, check it.

1:52:17.522 --> 1:52:19.149
This is Sarah.

1:52:19.149 --> 1:52:20.775
- Oh, hell no.

1:52:20.775 --> 1:52:22.360
- And this is Lin.

1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:23.945
That's you right there.
- [Lin] Fuck you.

1:52:25.989 --> 1:52:27.657
You're disgusting.

1:52:27.657 --> 1:52:29.325
- You got serious issues.

1:52:29.325 --> 1:52:31.327
- No, Danny boy, I got a belief.

1:52:32.287 --> 1:52:33.329
You see, I believ-

1:52:33.496 --> 1:52:35.749
- Out of the way, dickhead.

1:52:36.499 --> 1:52:38.042
- [Nick] What the fuck did he just say?

1:52:38.752 --> 1:52:40.253
-[Marko] I think he just called
you a dickhead, dickhead.

1:52:40.253 --> 1:52:42.213
- Yeah, got a little family, dickhead.

1:52:42.213 --> 1:52:43.339
- Guys, we did it.

1:52:43.339 --> 1:52:45.467
We actually did it.

1:52:45.467 --> 1:52:47.385
- Oh shit, it actually worked.

1:52:47.385 --> 1:52:48.219
Wait.

1:52:50.305 --> 1:52:52.182
How long is 72 months?

1:52:52.182 --> 1:52:54.058
- Six years, he got six years.

1:52:55.226 --> 1:52:56.102
- Look familiar?

1:52:57.103 --> 1:52:58.021
- Good job, little man.

1:52:58.021 --> 1:53:00.273
So we finally did something good for once.

1:53:00.273 --> 1:53:01.941
- And this is just the beginning.

1:53:04.194 --> 1:53:07.197
- Did you really know that
what 72 divided by 12 was?

1:53:07.197 --> 1:53:08.406
-We're not all half Asian.

1:53:08.406 --> 1:53:09.282
- It's basic math.

1:53:09.282 --> 1:53:10.200
- You're basic math.

1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:12.786
- That doesn't even make sense.

1:53:13.244 --> 1:53:15.246
- Oh my god, you guys.

1:53:16.915 --> 1:53:19.125
(somber music)

1:53:28.259 --> 1:53:29.886
-There he is

1:53:31.429 --> 1:53:32.722
- He looks happy

1:53:37.101 --> 1:53:39.646
- Okay, you've seen him.

1:53:39.646 --> 1:53:40.480
- Wait.

1:53:42.106 --> 1:53:43.358
Just one moment.

1:53:49.197 --> 1:53:50.865
- Come on, let's go.
