02:01.999 --> 02:03.083
Wow.

02:04.167 --> 02:07.212
I can't believe
we're already saying goodbye.

02:07.295 --> 02:11.591
It's been great getting to know you,
Pee-wee Herman.

02:12.634 --> 02:15.178
Earth sure is a great planet.

02:16.096 --> 02:19.432
Your art, music, pizza.

02:20.726 --> 02:23.395
You sure took to our customs fast.

02:23.478 --> 02:25.731
Thanks for showing them to me.

02:26.815 --> 02:29.651
I've loved these last two weeks.

02:29.735 --> 02:32.571
- I wish I didn't have to go.
- [Pee-wee sniffles]

02:33.864 --> 02:34.990
Me, too.

02:35.699 --> 02:38.952
Come with me, back to my planet.

02:39.036 --> 02:41.038
Meet my family and friends.

02:41.538 --> 02:43.874
Live with me.

02:43.957 --> 02:45.291
I can't.

02:45.375 --> 02:48.545
I need to stay here
with the people of Earth.

02:48.628 --> 02:51.840
I'm going to miss my new best friend.

02:51.924 --> 02:56.261
I'll never forget you, Pee-wee.

02:56.344 --> 02:59.389
I'll always remember you, too, Yul.

03:00.057 --> 03:01.767
Look.

03:01.850 --> 03:04.019
I made us both friendship bracelets.

03:04.103 --> 03:05.395
[gasps]

03:06.605 --> 03:09.566
Pee-wee, they're beautiful.

03:09.649 --> 03:11.484
Let's put them on.

03:19.409 --> 03:20.619
[sniffles]

03:22.871 --> 03:24.748
I guess this is...

03:24.831 --> 03:27.626
<i>arrivederci</i> then, right?

03:28.251 --> 03:29.252
Right.

03:30.003 --> 03:33.214
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Pee-wee Herman.

03:34.049 --> 03:36.051
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Yul.

03:36.135 --> 03:37.970
- [spaceship whirring]
- [both gasping]

03:56.279 --> 03:59.074
I want to go, but I can't leave home!

03:59.158 --> 04:02.577
I can't leave home!
I can't leave home!

04:03.912 --> 04:05.831
I want to go, but I can't leave home!

04:05.914 --> 04:08.291
- I can't leave home! I can't leave home!
- [alarm ringing]

04:08.374 --> 04:09.626
- I can't leave home.
- [ringing continues]

04:09.709 --> 04:13.338
I can't leave home!
I can't leave home!

04:14.422 --> 04:16.716
[chuckles] Morning!

04:19.052 --> 04:20.137
[yelling]

04:20.220 --> 04:21.221
[laughing]

04:25.934 --> 04:27.602
[chuckles] Ooh!

04:38.905 --> 04:40.365
[hissing]

04:45.996 --> 04:47.622
- [deflating]
- [gasps]

04:50.625 --> 04:51.835
[yelling]

04:54.337 --> 04:57.132
[screaming and laughing]

05:01.053 --> 05:02.512
[laughs]

05:12.480 --> 05:13.565
Ooh!

05:13.648 --> 05:14.983
Apple-y! [chuckles]

05:15.067 --> 05:18.361
- Good morning, Pee-wee!
- Morning, Mr. Murgatroyd!

05:20.864 --> 05:21.948
[chuckles]

05:22.032 --> 05:24.243
- [all] Pee-wee!
- Hi, kids! [grunts]

05:34.169 --> 05:36.171
Ooh! Ooh! [chuckles]

05:41.551 --> 05:42.635
[cat meowing]

05:46.472 --> 05:48.016
[barking]

05:54.856 --> 05:56.108
Hello! [chuckles]

05:57.442 --> 05:58.651
[chuckles]

05:58.735 --> 05:59.945
Breakfast bar!

06:00.028 --> 06:02.447
Scone, French toast, American toast...

06:02.530 --> 06:03.698
[sneezes]

06:03.782 --> 06:08.078
Green grapes, sausages,
bacon, cinnamon toast!

06:10.538 --> 06:11.831
Buh-bye!

06:15.210 --> 06:16.377
[screaming]

06:24.510 --> 06:26.221
Good morning, Pee-wee!

06:28.974 --> 06:30.100
[Pee-wee grunts]

06:31.226 --> 06:32.852
Good morning, Mrs. Rose!

06:32.936 --> 06:34.938
[chuckles] Oh, look at you.

06:35.063 --> 06:37.523
You're cute as a peanut!

06:37.607 --> 06:39.484
- Ow!
- [both laughing]

06:41.320 --> 06:43.071
Have you heard about
those new corduroy pillows?

06:43.155 --> 06:45.615
- Corduroy pillows? No.
- [chuckles]

06:45.698 --> 06:48.201
I'm surprised,
'cause they're making head lines!

06:48.285 --> 06:49.452
[laughs]

06:49.535 --> 06:51.371
Get it? "Head lines!"

06:51.454 --> 06:52.872
Oh! [laughs]

06:53.790 --> 06:56.001
- Hold on. Hey, Ruby!
- Morning, Pee-wee.

06:56.084 --> 06:58.962
- Last stop, Nana's Yarn Barn!
- Oh!

07:00.588 --> 07:02.215
[both exclaim]

07:03.258 --> 07:04.634
[both laughing]

07:05.218 --> 07:08.554
You're the sweetest boy in Fairville,
Pee-wee.

07:08.638 --> 07:12.184
- Me?
- Is there anything sweeter than you?

07:12.267 --> 07:15.145
Uh... a Root Beer Barrel?

07:15.228 --> 07:18.273
- That's right!
- [chuckles]

07:18.357 --> 07:21.193
I know they're in here somewhere.

07:23.111 --> 07:24.904
There it is. [gasps]

07:24.988 --> 07:27.157
No.
What was I looking for?

07:27.240 --> 07:29.826
[gasps] Oh...

07:30.827 --> 07:32.871
[laughs]

07:32.954 --> 07:34.664
Root Beer Barrels are my favorite!

07:36.666 --> 07:37.917
Boop! [chuckles]

07:44.590 --> 07:46.009
Ah! [chuckles]

07:46.676 --> 07:49.929
Well, listen, you seem really busy.
Let me let you let me run.

07:50.013 --> 07:52.432
- Bye, Mrs. Rose!
- Bye-bye, Pee-wee.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.059
[laughing]

07:54.142 --> 07:55.185
[horn honking]

07:55.268 --> 07:57.812
- Pee-wee!
- Yo, Billy!

07:59.064 --> 08:01.524
- Hey, Pee-wee!
- Hey, Ben!

08:02.234 --> 08:05.486
- Morning, Pee-wee!
- Kevin!

08:05.570 --> 08:07.947
- [chuckles]
- Pee-wee!

08:08.031 --> 08:09.574
I'm so glad I bumped into you.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.910
I've got an amazing deal
I want to tell you about.

08:11.993 --> 08:13.578
You're gonna have to tell me later, Marvin.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.996
I'm on my way to work. [chuckles]

08:15.080 --> 08:18.333
Just a moment of your time.
Come on, Pee-wee.

08:19.334 --> 08:23.129
Tell me, Pee-wee, where do you
picture yourself on vacation?

08:23.213 --> 08:24.714
Mexico?

08:24.797 --> 08:26.132
Or Morocco?

08:26.216 --> 08:27.800
Mexico?

08:27.884 --> 08:29.677
Morocco?

08:29.761 --> 08:32.804
What is this?
A travel agency or a millinery?

08:32.889 --> 08:36.142
Sorry, Marvin, I'm not interested.

08:36.226 --> 08:37.352
[stutters] Come on, Pee-wee.

08:37.436 --> 08:38.852
Don't you ever wonder

08:38.937 --> 08:41.647
- what life is like outside Fairville?
- Nope!

08:42.774 --> 08:46.319
Marvin, you know I don't want
to go anywhere or try anything new.

08:46.403 --> 08:47.487
Bye! [chuckles]

08:59.874 --> 09:01.209
[chuckles]

09:05.422 --> 09:06.881
[chuckles] Phew!

09:06.965 --> 09:08.925
[screams]

09:09.008 --> 09:12.095
Emily, you scared me there for a moment.

09:12.929 --> 09:14.597
I know I have overdue books.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.557
I'm gonna return them soon, I promise.

09:16.641 --> 09:19.144
- I don't care about silly overdue books.
- Oh?

09:19.227 --> 09:22.230
But I do have something special
I wanted to give to you.

09:22.314 --> 09:23.648
[chuckles]

09:23.731 --> 09:25.066
Hmm.

09:26.859 --> 09:29.321
[Pee-wee gasps] The new <i>Scuba Cop?</i>

09:29.404 --> 09:30.863
<i>The Emerald Sharks?</i>

09:30.947 --> 09:33.616
And the sharks are hammerheads?

09:33.699 --> 09:36.619
These are the exact type of sharks
that Scuba Cop hates the most!

09:36.702 --> 09:40.332
I haven't received your RSVP
for the Book Club tomorrow night.

09:40.415 --> 09:42.375
I was thinking that, maybe afterwards,
you and I might...

09:42.459 --> 09:45.295
Whoa, whoa!
Emily, let me stop you right there.

09:45.378 --> 09:47.005
The fact is...

09:47.088 --> 09:49.424
I neglected to RSVP my regrets.

09:49.508 --> 09:51.801
I have rehearsal that night. NA.

09:51.884 --> 09:54.471
- NA?
- Not available.

09:54.554 --> 09:55.555
- Sorry.
- [chuckles]

09:55.638 --> 09:57.390
Well, what time is your rehearsal?

09:57.474 --> 09:59.100
Oh, uh, TBD.

09:59.184 --> 10:01.727
- TBD?
- To be decided.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.940
LATT, Em. IHTBG.

10:06.024 --> 10:09.944
- [chuckles] What?
- LATT, IHTBG.

10:10.028 --> 10:11.488
- IHT...
- "Look at the time."

10:11.571 --> 10:13.573
"I have to be going."

10:13.656 --> 10:15.616
You understand.

10:17.952 --> 10:18.953
[horn honking]

10:20.163 --> 10:22.081
Yay! Work time!

10:22.165 --> 10:24.000
[chuckles]

10:24.083 --> 10:25.751
[indistinct chatter]

10:28.254 --> 10:32.509
Two eggs, fried, extra hash browns,
side of sausage. Enjoy!

10:32.592 --> 10:35.387
Looks fantastic as always, Beverly.

10:35.470 --> 10:36.596
[phone ringing]

10:36.679 --> 10:39.474
Dan's Diner.
Dan speaking.

10:39.558 --> 10:41.351
[humming]

10:42.435 --> 10:43.811
[chuckles]

10:49.568 --> 10:51.611
- French toast is up, Bev!
- [bell dings]

10:52.820 --> 10:54.739
Denver omelet.
Easy on the cheese.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.534
Easy on the cheese-y, coming right up-y!

11:00.161 --> 11:01.829
Boop. [chuckles]

11:03.873 --> 11:07.293
Dudley! Sylvester! Clovis!
What are you guys doing here?

11:07.377 --> 11:10.088
Pee-wee, we need to talk to you
about band rehearsal.

11:10.171 --> 11:13.758
Well, it is unusual to be discussing
Renegades business at my workplace,

11:13.841 --> 11:15.009
but, sure, what's up?

11:15.093 --> 11:18.638
My promotion at the grocery store means
I'm gonna be working a lot more hours.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.139
Nights.

11:20.223 --> 11:23.851
Yeah, and my girlfriend's making me take
ballroom dancing with her

11:23.935 --> 11:25.562
four times a week.

11:25.645 --> 11:26.729
Nights.

11:26.812 --> 11:30.275
My office just pressured me into joining
their nighttime bowling league.

11:30.358 --> 11:31.401
Nights.

11:31.484 --> 11:33.986
But the Renegades rehearse at night.

11:34.070 --> 11:37.156
Hello? How's that gonna work
if all you guys are so busy at night?

11:37.240 --> 11:38.408
It's not.

11:38.491 --> 11:40.452
The Renegades are breaking up.

11:41.411 --> 11:42.495
What?

11:43.996 --> 11:45.831
- No!
- Things are changing.

11:45.915 --> 11:48.460
None of us have enough time
to be in a band anymore.

11:48.543 --> 11:49.544
I do!

11:49.628 --> 11:51.421
That's because you're stuck in a rut,
Pee-wee.

11:51.504 --> 11:53.047
We want to move on to other things.

11:53.131 --> 11:55.007
What am I supposed to move on to?

11:55.091 --> 11:57.009
What am I supposed to do
with my flutophone?

11:57.093 --> 11:58.928
Why don't you think about a solo career?

11:59.011 --> 12:00.721
Why don't you?

12:11.190 --> 12:12.400
[Pee-wee] Good luck, you guys.

12:13.192 --> 12:17.280
Good luck with all your stupid, important
reasons for breaking up the Renegades!

12:17.363 --> 12:18.698
[all sighing]

12:21.618 --> 12:22.952
[grunting]

12:28.458 --> 12:30.042
[clattering]

12:39.927 --> 12:41.304
- [door opening]
- [Dan chuckles]

12:41.387 --> 12:43.598
- Nice seeing you, Dan.
- Bye, Dan!

12:44.724 --> 12:48.102
Pee-wee, I gotta say,
your French toast is perfection!

12:48.186 --> 12:49.312
Thanks.

12:49.395 --> 12:53.232
Same with your pancakes, Herman.
They drive me crazy!

12:53.316 --> 12:55.443
Not that long a drive, Ernie, but thanks.

12:55.527 --> 12:57.945
I'm taking this biscuit with me.

12:58.029 --> 12:59.030
I love it.

12:59.113 --> 13:00.699
- Why don't you marry it?
- [all laugh]

13:00.781 --> 13:04.327
Listen, you guys, you seem really busy.
Let me let you let me run, okay?

13:04.410 --> 13:05.828
All right? Buh-bye!

13:05.911 --> 13:06.996
- Thanks for coming.
- Later!

13:07.079 --> 13:08.540
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

13:08.623 --> 13:12.001
Hey, sport, can you watch over the diner?

13:12.084 --> 13:14.295
I gotta go meet a couple pals at the lodge.

13:14.379 --> 13:17.632
Sure, Dan. I'll be right here.
Where else would I go?

13:17.716 --> 13:20.259
Gonna be right here.
Just like always.

13:21.469 --> 13:22.762
Have fun with your pals!

13:22.845 --> 13:24.889
[laughs] Attaboy!

13:34.566 --> 13:36.150
[clattering]

13:44.743 --> 13:46.411
[crying]

13:48.663 --> 13:51.207
[tears sizzling]

13:59.257 --> 14:01.426
Sharks pulling off a jewel heist?
[chuckles]

14:01.509 --> 14:02.802
It could happen,

14:02.885 --> 14:06.097
but not if Scuba Cop happens to be
swimming around! [laughs]

14:06.180 --> 14:07.682
[motorcycle engine revving]

14:22.029 --> 14:24.574
[soul music playing]

14:24.657 --> 14:26.200
Cool.

14:26.826 --> 14:28.035
[rock music playing]

14:29.412 --> 14:30.871
Double cool.

14:31.956 --> 14:34.459
[songs mash up]

14:35.293 --> 14:36.628
Triple cool.

14:40.423 --> 14:42.341
Uh, hi! What can I get you?

14:42.425 --> 14:44.761
- Milkshake, please.
- Flavor?

14:46.387 --> 14:47.555
Let's say chocolate.

14:47.639 --> 14:49.265
Sure. Three, two, one.

14:49.348 --> 14:51.851
- [both] Chocolate.
- [chuckles]

15:01.193 --> 15:02.695
[Pee-wee humming]

15:05.698 --> 15:07.492
Boop! [chuckles]

15:07.575 --> 15:09.744
[humming]

15:09.828 --> 15:11.245
Ooh! [chuckles]

15:16.668 --> 15:19.211
Ooh! [chuckles]

15:19.295 --> 15:21.255
[continues humming]

15:23.382 --> 15:26.302
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

15:26.385 --> 15:28.220
La! [chuckles]

15:36.187 --> 15:38.397
- [mixer whirring]
- [exclaiming]

15:49.408 --> 15:50.869
[mimics retching]

15:50.951 --> 15:51.952
[chuckles]

16:05.591 --> 16:07.426
Boop! Think fast!

16:17.520 --> 16:18.979
Wow!

16:19.063 --> 16:21.023
Thanks, appreciate that.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.483
[grunts]

16:24.151 --> 16:25.194
Mmm.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.115
Mmm!

16:31.116 --> 16:32.159
Mmm!

16:33.953 --> 16:36.497
[exclaiming]

16:36.581 --> 16:38.791
Wow, man!

16:38.875 --> 16:40.877
This milkshake is outrageous.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.879
I really mean it.
Probably... [inhales]

16:42.962 --> 16:44.296
top five, all-time.

16:44.380 --> 16:46.841
[chuckles] Thanks, my specialty.

16:46.925 --> 16:48.968
You know what would go great
with a milkshake of this caliber?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.261
[both] A Root Beer Barrel!

16:51.888 --> 16:54.599
[both] Only the best candy in the world!

16:54.682 --> 16:55.725
[both] It really is!

16:55.808 --> 16:57.184
[both] Distant second?

16:57.268 --> 16:59.854
[both] Charleston Chew. Third?

16:59.979 --> 17:01.564
[both] Tie between two candies.

17:01.647 --> 17:02.690
[both] Rolos and Skittles!

17:02.774 --> 17:03.900
[both] Shut up!

17:03.983 --> 17:05.483
[both] Shut up!

17:05.568 --> 17:07.027
[both] Shut up.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.742
Well, all right,
Mr. Master Milkshake Maker,

17:12.825 --> 17:14.743
what do you say you show me around
this little burg of yours?

17:14.827 --> 17:18.204
Me? A tour of Fairville?
I'd love to!

17:18.289 --> 17:20.959
Oh, I can't.
I gotta watch over the diner.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.252
- I promised Dan and Beverly...
- "Promised Dan and Beverly"?

17:23.335 --> 17:26.005
Will you listen to yourself?
You sound like a little baby.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.048
We'll only be gone ten minutes.

17:28.132 --> 17:30.676
Chillax, man.
Live a little.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.261
What?

17:34.513 --> 17:35.514
Live a little.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.601
[whispers] Live a little.

17:42.814 --> 17:44.356
[chuckles]

17:44.440 --> 17:45.817
[motorcycle engine idling]

17:50.404 --> 17:52.865
I have kind of limited experience
on a motorcycle.

17:52.949 --> 17:54.241
Shh!

17:55.159 --> 17:57.912
- You hear that?
- What?

17:57.996 --> 18:01.332
It's the old highway callin'.
Get on.

18:01.415 --> 18:03.542
[chuckles]

18:06.545 --> 18:08.172
[engine revving]

18:12.635 --> 18:14.512
[Pee-wee laughing]

18:22.186 --> 18:24.063
- Wicked-awesome view, dude!
- [chuckles]

18:24.146 --> 18:27.358
- And it's right in your backyard.
- I'm glad you like it.

18:27.441 --> 18:31.195
It roughly corresponds
to the model scale HO-187.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.155
Wow, this is a whole new world for me.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.074
A miniature world!

18:35.157 --> 18:36.283
[both laughing]

18:36.367 --> 18:38.661
A miniature world.

18:38.744 --> 18:41.998
I mean, look at the detail.
It's breathtaking.

18:42.081 --> 18:43.875
You got a real gift, man.

18:43.958 --> 18:45.001
Thank you.

18:45.084 --> 18:47.712
Hey, how about that tour of Fairville?

18:48.796 --> 18:52.257
Right over there, that's Dan's Diner,
where we met.

18:52.341 --> 18:55.427
And there, Fairville Public Library.

18:55.511 --> 18:57.096
Fairville High.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.098
Tire Repair of Fairville.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.892
Fairville Fire Department.

19:00.975 --> 19:02.309
Barber of Fairville.

19:02.393 --> 19:03.644
And this right here,

19:03.728 --> 19:07.523
this little building is where Fairville's
premier music group, the Renega...

19:08.566 --> 19:11.485
- What's wrong? What's that building?
- Nothing.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.821
It's just some stupid building

19:13.905 --> 19:17.282
where my stupid band used to rehearse
before we broke up!

19:17.366 --> 19:18.951
Let me get that right out of there.

19:20.119 --> 19:22.788
[Pee-wee grunts]
Stupid! Stupid!

19:24.373 --> 19:25.457
[yelling]

19:25.541 --> 19:27.459
[yelling continues]

19:29.670 --> 19:30.671
You okay?

19:30.755 --> 19:33.091
Yeah, sure. I'm fine. [chuckles]

19:34.800 --> 19:35.843
Hey! What's that?

19:36.761 --> 19:38.888
[chuckles] Is that your house?

19:39.680 --> 19:41.640
I didn't notice you had a tree house.

19:41.724 --> 19:42.725
Oh, I don't.

19:42.808 --> 19:45.853
That's the only detail
of this entire model that doesn't exist...

19:45.937 --> 19:46.896
yet.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.522
- [both laugh]
- That's funny.

19:48.606 --> 19:50.524
You know, I always wanted
a tree house, too.

19:50.608 --> 19:52.317
That is funny!

19:52.401 --> 19:53.903
[both laughing]

19:55.113 --> 19:56.114
Say...

19:57.364 --> 19:59.742
What do you say you and me
get a picture of us

19:59.825 --> 20:01.619
at the site of your future tree house?

20:01.702 --> 20:05.039
You ready?
Three, two, one.

20:05.123 --> 20:06.791
- [both] Root Beer Barrels!
- [shutter clicking]

20:09.585 --> 20:11.211
You know, I never caught your name.

20:11.295 --> 20:14.673
Oh, it's Pee-wee. Pee-wee Herman.
And you are?

20:14.757 --> 20:16.759
[laughs] Good one.

20:17.468 --> 20:18.886
Uh... what?

20:20.345 --> 20:21.973
Wait...

20:22.056 --> 20:23.182
you don't know who I am?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.309
How could I?
Why would I?

20:25.392 --> 20:27.145
I'm Joe...

20:27.227 --> 20:28.312
Manganiello.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.898
Well, pleasure to meet you,
Joe Man... [mumbling]

20:30.982 --> 20:32.650
Manganiello.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.276
Sorry, trick ear.
One more time.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.569
Manganiello.

20:37.613 --> 20:38.781
I'm an actor.

20:38.864 --> 20:41.533
I'm told show business
can be very competitive,

20:41.617 --> 20:44.536
so hang on to your dreams
and who knows? [chuckles]

20:44.620 --> 20:46.413
I wish you luck, Joe Man... [mumbling]

20:46.497 --> 20:49.458
- Certainly you've heard of <i>True Blood?</i>
- Uh-uh.

20:50.209 --> 20:52.962
<i>- Magic Mike?</i>
- Hmm, you'd think so, but no.

20:53.545 --> 20:54.964
Man, you're so real.

20:55.047 --> 20:56.924
That's what I like about you, Pee-wee.
You're normal.

20:57.008 --> 20:58.342
- [chuckles]
- [laughs]

20:58.425 --> 21:00.845
[exclaims]
Your miniature world is awesome.

21:03.222 --> 21:05.516
Hey, what's on the other side
of those railroad tracks?

21:05.599 --> 21:06.976
Beyond Fairville?

21:07.059 --> 21:09.145
I don't know, I've never been there.

21:09.228 --> 21:10.188
Never?

21:11.856 --> 21:13.983
May I tell you something
I've never told anyone?

21:15.442 --> 21:16.527
Sure.

21:16.610 --> 21:17.653
What is it?

21:18.362 --> 21:20.280
Once upon a time, I won a contest.

21:20.364 --> 21:23.075
A trip to Salt Lake City, Utah.

21:23.159 --> 21:24.785
- [fanfare]
- [kids exclaiming]

21:24.869 --> 21:27.412
- But I never made it to Salt Lake City.
- [tires squealing]

21:27.496 --> 21:29.456
- Or Utah.
- [car crashing]

21:29.540 --> 21:32.126
- Long story short...
- [faint sirens wailing and gunfire]

21:32.210 --> 21:34.628
I came back with a metal plate in my head.

21:34.712 --> 21:35.921
- [metal clinking]
- [EKG flatlining]

21:37.006 --> 21:39.967
That explains why you don't travel.
[sighs] Hmm...

21:40.885 --> 21:43.387
[stutters] Do you ever get worried
that life's just passing you by?

21:43.470 --> 21:44.763
Ha!

21:44.847 --> 21:48.350
What could possibly be going on out there
that I haven't tried already in Fairville?

21:48.433 --> 21:50.728
- You ever been in a fight?
- No.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.605
- You ever broken a rule?
- No!

21:53.689 --> 21:55.107
You ever had two women fight over you?

21:55.191 --> 21:56.358
Uh...

21:56.441 --> 21:57.902
Have I? No.

21:58.819 --> 22:02.489
Breaking rules and breaking hearts,
that's what life's all about.

22:02.573 --> 22:04.075
I believe in fate.

22:04.158 --> 22:05.784
And I think I know why you and I met.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.455
You're gonna leave Fairville...

22:10.539 --> 22:12.875
and you're gonna take a holiday.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.877
I got your reason right here.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.171
What is it? What?

22:22.009 --> 22:23.886
I want you to be at my birthday party.

22:25.554 --> 22:27.056
New York City! [chuckles]

22:27.139 --> 22:28.348
How would I ever...

22:28.432 --> 22:31.102
[stammering] I couldn't possibly...

22:31.185 --> 22:33.187
This is all happening so fast.

22:33.312 --> 22:34.980
See you in five days, brother.

22:35.106 --> 22:37.524
"Five days"?
"Brother"?

22:37.608 --> 22:40.194
- I've never even been on an airplane.
- No!

22:40.278 --> 22:42.362
The only thing you're gonna
learn about yourself on a plane

22:42.446 --> 22:46.117
is that you like the honey-roasted peanuts
better than the plain-salted.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.535
If you're really hungry,

22:48.619 --> 22:51.289
the open road is a smorgasbord
of life experience.

22:51.872 --> 22:56.294
A few days on the open road
is worth a lifetime in Fairville.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.962
The way I see it, Pee-wee Herman,

22:58.045 --> 23:00.672
you got a choice to make.

23:00.756 --> 23:02.424
Stick around here...

23:04.009 --> 23:05.177
[engine starting]

23:05.261 --> 23:07.346
...or live a little.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.680
[tires squealing]

23:14.061 --> 23:16.021
Stick around here...

23:16.105 --> 23:17.564
or live a little.

23:18.774 --> 23:19.942
What should I do?

23:20.985 --> 23:22.903
I wish I had some kind of sign.

23:25.739 --> 23:28.200
Whoa, that's a big apple.

23:29.285 --> 23:30.577
Big Apple!

23:30.661 --> 23:32.454
That's it! Bingo!

23:33.705 --> 23:35.916
- Can I get anybody more water?
- Where's my order?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.417
Where's the food?

23:37.501 --> 23:38.669
I'm starving!

23:38.752 --> 23:41.339
Bev, my lunch break is practically over!

23:41.421 --> 23:43.799
- Me hungry!
- [thudding]

23:44.758 --> 23:47.594
Shoot! Heck! Darn!

23:50.722 --> 23:52.391
Pee-wee, where have you been?

23:53.351 --> 23:54.352
I'm leaving town.

23:55.686 --> 23:59.190
I won't be at work tomorrow
or the next day or the day after that.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.776
I'm taking a holiday.

24:04.362 --> 24:06.197

[chuckles]

24:17.166 --> 24:18.417

Come on, Little Connie.
We're going to New York City!

is off to a perfect start!

Oh, my gosh!

We just fed you.

Listen, ladies, it's been real
and it's been fun.

27:33.320 --> 27:36.240
But has it been real fun? Mmm-mmm.

27:36.323 --> 27:37.449
Nope.

27:38.283 --> 27:39.868
Come on, let me go.

27:39.951 --> 27:42.746
I gotta get to New York City,
to my friend's birthday party.

27:42.829 --> 27:47.251
I don't care if your friend
is the Queen of England

27:47.334 --> 27:50.212
and she's throwing her
100th birthday party

27:50.295 --> 27:53.173
in the Statue of Liberty's underpants!

Hey, Pepper.

He seems okay.

28:03.642 --> 28:05.352
Maybe we can trust him.

28:05.436 --> 28:07.729
No way!
He'll go and squeal to the cops.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.524
- But I...
- Pipe down, squirrel!

28:10.608 --> 28:13.527
My name's not Squirrel.
It's Pee-wee.

28:13.611 --> 28:15.320
[both laughing]

28:21.452 --> 28:22.786
What's so funny?

28:24.622 --> 28:27.499
We never introduced ourselves.

28:28.750 --> 28:29.960
I'm Pepper.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.005
Freckles.

28:36.925 --> 28:39.886
My name's Bella. Nickname...

Pee-wee.

28:45.267 --> 28:46.560
Your name's Pee-wee?

28:47.102 --> 28:48.979
Yeah, Pee-wee.

28:50.689 --> 28:52.399
I've never met another one.

28:53.150 --> 28:54.734
Me neither.

28:56.320 --> 28:59.364
Uh... Pee-wee and Pee-wee.

28:59.448 --> 29:00.782
Touching.

29:00.865 --> 29:02.534
Gets me right here.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.745

29:05.829 --> 29:07.414
[knocking at door]

29:07.498 --> 29:10.250
Police! We have you surrounded!
Open up!

29:16.298 --> 29:17.633
Oh, thank goodness you're here, officers!

29:17.716 --> 29:18.967
Ladies, you're under arrest.

29:19.050 --> 29:20.385
Mmm-hmm.

29:20.885 --> 29:22.471
For being too hot!

29:24.473 --> 29:25.724
Fooled ya, girls!

29:25.807 --> 29:29.019
I got these hunks out of the yellow pages.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.479

30:16.400 --> 30:18.068
Great, Little Connie's gone.

30:18.569 --> 30:19.695
Perfect!

30:19.778 --> 30:22.239
It's all good.
No worries.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.157
- Same difference!
- Pardon me.

30:24.241 --> 30:25.325
Sir?

30:26.577 --> 30:27.911
Everything okay?

30:27.994 --> 30:30.205
My car's been stolen.

30:30.288 --> 30:32.374
[exhales] That's terrible.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.042
Well...

30:34.876 --> 30:37.462
I'm heading east.
Need a lift?

You are a life-saver!

30:39.964 --> 30:41.341
[both laughing]

30:41.425 --> 30:45.303
I'm no hero.
Just a traveling salesman. [chuckles]

30:45.845 --> 30:48.515
- Hey, don't forget your coffee.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:48.599 --> 30:49.600
I...

30:49.683 --> 30:51.309
I thought you might say that.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.437
- Ah!

30:53.520 --> 30:54.730
Magnet!

30:54.813 --> 30:56.314
Good one! You got me!

30:56.398 --> 30:58.233
One of my top sellers.

30:58.316 --> 30:59.401
Oh!

30:59.484 --> 31:00.652
And...

31:01.779 --> 31:04.030

Ew! Snake farm, yuck.

31:35.979 --> 31:38.106
Ugh, I hate snakes.

31:38.189 --> 31:41.401
One of the area's
most popular attractions!

31:41.485 --> 31:44.112
And, it just so happens, our next stop.

31:44.738 --> 31:47.574
I supply their gift shop. [chuckles]

31:48.617 --> 31:49.618
These...

31:50.577 --> 31:52.579

31:52.663 --> 31:54.665
- The big-sellers.

32:58.937 --> 33:01.231

Yuck. Ugh!

33:10.741 --> 33:12.450

By the time we leave this place,
I bet you'll be a snake lover, Pee-wee.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.612
Bet me!

34:31.696 --> 34:32.947
Come on.

34:34.699 --> 34:40.413
Baby rattlers are the most dangerous,
because their venom is the strongest.

34:49.464 --> 34:51.591
- That's stupid.
- [laughs]

34:51.675 --> 34:55.178
Come on, I can't wait
for you to see this place.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.181
They got a snake in here
as big as that bus.

35:00.017 --> 35:04.270
Clay and Jimmy, behold the Cuatro Fuego.

Yawn.

35:38.429 --> 35:39.472
Stupid.

35:39.556 --> 35:42.934
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, as always.

35:43.894 --> 35:46.063
How you liking the Snake Farm, Pee-wee?

35:46.145 --> 35:47.898
I thought it would be a little scarier.

35:47.981 --> 35:49.649
You want scary, huh?

35:50.650 --> 35:53.486
If you're really looking to see
something scary...

35:53.570 --> 35:55.655
who's he gotta see, Jimmy?

35:55.739 --> 35:57.240
The Monster.

35:58.575 --> 36:00.702
That is, if you're brave enough.

36:00.785 --> 36:02.662
I think I could handle it.

36:02.746 --> 36:04.288
Well, let's go.

38:51.789 --> 38:53.541
Trespass? [chuckles]

38:53.624 --> 38:56.753
No such thing in the heartland, stranger.

38:56.836 --> 38:59.422
They call me Farmer Brown.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.799
They call me Pee-wee Herman.
Pleased to meet you.

49:29.009 --> 49:30.511
I'm not gonna make it.

49:30.594 --> 49:32.596
The party's in two days.

49:32.680 --> 49:34.640
Look where I am.

49:34.724 --> 49:36.684
Look where I need to be.

49:37.351 --> 49:38.561
I won't get there in time.

49:38.644 --> 49:40.979
What's wrong, baby?

49:41.063 --> 49:43.691
I might as well give up
and go back to Fairville.

49:45.609 --> 49:48.487
My friend won't even notice
I'm not at his party.

49:48.571 --> 49:50.030
Oh, I bet he will.

49:50.113 --> 49:52.991
I would notice if Brook or Lane or Wanda
didn't show up to my party.

49:53.075 --> 49:54.535

I'm in the prime of my life here.

I say live a lot.

53:32.128 --> 53:33.378
Live it up.

doesn't collapse on him.

01:19:36.398 --> 01:19:37.650
Collapse on him?

01:19:37.733 --> 01:19:39.860
Darn it, Captain, how could
something like this even happen?

01:19:39.943 --> 01:19:42.070
Why wasn't there something
covering the well?

01:19:42.154 --> 01:19:44.448
You're right, Mr. Manganiello.
That's the problem.

01:19:44.532 --> 01:19:47.368
This metal plate should've
been covering the well.

01:19:49.537 --> 01:19:50.954
Metal plate?

01:19:52.581 --> 01:19:53.790
Wait...

01:19:54.916 --> 01:19:55.917
I've got it.

01:19:58.295 --> 01:20:00.255
- Heads up, Pee-wee!
- [gasps]

01:20:06.428 --> 01:20:07.429
- [metal clinking]
- Ow!

01:20:07.513 --> 01:20:08.930
[grunting]

01:20:10.349 --> 01:20:11.726
[straining]

01:20:17.981 --> 01:20:19.066
[Joe] Hold on, Pee-wee.

01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:20.651
My God!

01:20:20.735 --> 01:20:22.236
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:20:22.319 --> 01:20:24.446
- Just a little further!
- [Pee-wee] My brain!

01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:26.865
[groaning]

01:20:33.581 --> 01:20:34.790
I gotcha!

01:20:34.873 --> 01:20:36.584
[all gasping]

01:20:36.667 --> 01:20:37.834
[whispers] Pee-wee!

01:20:37.918 --> 01:20:38.919
[straining] Come on!

01:20:40.295 --> 01:20:42.130
- Joe!
- Pee-wee!

01:20:42.214 --> 01:20:43.507
Happy birthday!

01:20:44.841 --> 01:20:47.386
<i>The boy in the well is free!</i>

01:20:47.469 --> 01:20:50.806
[all cheering]

01:20:56.812 --> 01:20:58.564
What do you say we get to my party?

01:20:58.647 --> 01:20:59.898
What party?

01:20:59.981 --> 01:21:01.483
[both laughing]

01:21:13.078 --> 01:21:15.790
Wait, I thought you lived
in the penthouse.

01:21:15.872 --> 01:21:17.416
Oh, I do.

01:21:17.499 --> 01:21:19.334
Aren't we going to your party?

01:21:19.418 --> 01:21:21.378
Pee-wee, we are the party.

01:21:21.462 --> 01:21:22.546
[elevator bell dings]

01:21:28.844 --> 01:21:31.346
[gasps] Holy fudge!

01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:34.683
- A giant miniature world!
- [Joe] Yep!

01:21:34.767 --> 01:21:36.852
A giant miniature world.

01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:40.230
I made it all myself.
From my imagination.

01:21:41.273 --> 01:21:43.400
[Pee-wee] Dinosaur world!

01:21:43.484 --> 01:21:46.069
- Cool volcano!
- [Joe] That lava's cotton candy.

01:21:47.112 --> 01:21:50.324
Hey, you and I hit it off
the minute we met, remember?

01:21:50.407 --> 01:21:52.075
[chuckles]

01:21:52.159 --> 01:21:53.285
You inspired me.

01:21:54.578 --> 01:21:57.665
This is Glitter Mountain. Look!
I covered it with pixies.

01:21:58.582 --> 01:22:00.083
[train horn tooting]

01:22:01.084 --> 01:22:03.003
- [gasps]
- Oh, hey, looky here.

01:22:04.254 --> 01:22:07.215
Wow! You even have Fairville!

01:22:07.299 --> 01:22:09.677
Dan's Diner.
The town square.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.595
[gasps] My house!

01:22:11.679 --> 01:22:16.933
[gasps] Look, a miniature of my miniature!

01:22:17.017 --> 01:22:19.102
I knew you'd notice that. [chuckles]

01:22:19.186 --> 01:22:21.563
And... the best part.

01:22:23.482 --> 01:22:24.608
[gasps]

01:22:34.326 --> 01:22:35.828
My tree house!

01:22:39.373 --> 01:22:41.249
Look, Joe.

01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:43.502
I made this present for you.

01:22:45.796 --> 01:22:47.339
Happy birthday.

01:22:47.422 --> 01:22:49.633
A friendship bracelet.

01:22:49.717 --> 01:22:50.843
Right.

01:22:57.558 --> 01:22:58.684
And look.

01:23:00.143 --> 01:23:01.353
[chuckles] It's just like mine!

01:23:01.436 --> 01:23:03.438
- Yeah!
- [both laughing]

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.903
- You know what would make this perfect?
- Yep.

01:23:16.117 --> 01:23:17.118
Boop!

01:23:18.286 --> 01:23:19.287
Boop!

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.584
- [both] To friendship.
- [clinks]

01:23:30.048 --> 01:23:31.425
[both] Ah!

01:23:31.508 --> 01:23:33.343
[both laughing]

01:23:47.566 --> 01:23:48.776
Here you go, fellas.

01:23:48.859 --> 01:23:50.527
- Thanks, Bev. Yum!
- Thanks, Bev.

01:23:51.528 --> 01:23:53.113
What's this stuff on my plate?

01:23:53.196 --> 01:23:54.907
Look, it's on my plate, too.

01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:57.952
Let's ask the chef.
Hey, Pee-wee!

01:23:58.034 --> 01:23:59.202
Yes, Beverly?

01:23:59.286 --> 01:24:01.872
What is this on these gentlemen's plates?

01:24:01.956 --> 01:24:03.999
- Fish sticks.
- No, there.

01:24:04.082 --> 01:24:06.042
- Oh. You mean the garnish.
- Garnish?

01:24:06.126 --> 01:24:08.128
Yes, garnish.

01:24:08.211 --> 01:24:13.008
A decoration or embellishment
of a prepared food-plate or drink

01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:15.260
to augment the visual impact on the plate.

01:24:15.343 --> 01:24:16.386
Can you eat it?

01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:18.138
My garnish tastes like an orange.

01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:19.306
It is an orange.

01:24:19.389 --> 01:24:21.057
[Beverly] Yes, your meal
will come with garnish.

01:24:21.141 --> 01:24:22.434
Welcome back, Pee-wee!

01:24:22.517 --> 01:24:25.312
I can't put my finger on it, but there's
something different about you.

01:24:25.395 --> 01:24:27.522
[Emily] He's worldly now.
Right, Pee-wee?

01:24:27.606 --> 01:24:28.983
[Renegades] Pee-wee!

01:24:29.065 --> 01:24:31.693
Pee-wee, why don't you stop by
and jam with us tonight?

01:24:31.777 --> 01:24:33.487
Why don't you?

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:35.823
- This adding machine... hmm?
- Dan, check this out.

01:24:35.906 --> 01:24:37.866
Solar-powered calculator.

01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:38.951
Solar?

01:24:39.034 --> 01:24:40.911
Yep, from the Latin, <i>solaris,</i>

01:24:40.995 --> 01:24:44.498
meaning, "Derives its power
from the sun or <i>sol."</i>

01:24:44.581 --> 01:24:45.582
Hmm?

01:24:46.583 --> 01:24:49.044
[chuckles] It works!

01:24:49.127 --> 01:24:52.006
And this thing is just the size
of a business card!

01:24:52.088 --> 01:24:53.548
Ain't that a miracle?

01:24:53.632 --> 01:24:54.591
[chuckles]

01:25:01.682 --> 01:25:03.350
[motorcycle engine revving]

01:25:26.498 --> 01:25:27.875
[Pee-wee exclaims]

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.669
[Pee-wee laughs]

01:25:33.755 --> 01:25:34.756
[Pee-wee chuckles]
