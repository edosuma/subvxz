time, so we can get right to it.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.137
- I have a couple
of properties in mind

13:09.137 --> 13:10.896
that I'd like to look at.

13:10.896 --> 13:16.448
Not right now, but soon...
I wanna open another nightclub.

13:16.448 --> 13:19.413
- You're selling Eden?
- No. No.

13:19.413 --> 13:21.896
It's actually
the perfect time to expand.

13:21.896 --> 13:23.862
- Ah, your queendom.

13:23.862 --> 13:27.000
- Exactly.
- All hail.

13:31.241 --> 13:34.241
- It will be twice
the size of Eden.

13:37.172 --> 13:39.655
- How does Allen feel
about this new venture?

13:39.655 --> 13:43.827
- Oh, he won't be partnering
with me on this one.

13:43.827 --> 13:48.034
Just me.
- I see.

13:48.034 --> 13:51.689
- Everything that I do
from here on out,

13:51.689 --> 13:54.275
I do on my own.

13:58.724 --> 14:02.172
- I do need to make sure
that everything is in place.

14:02.172 --> 14:06.034
Every "i" dotted,
every "t" crossed.

14:06.034 --> 14:11.000
And that, Marcus,
that's where you come in.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.931
- Well!

14:13.931 --> 14:16.000
- As my attorney.

14:19.241 --> 14:21.241
We're gonna need to have
the same kind of documentation

14:21.241 --> 14:23.172
we had in place for Eden.
- Mm-hmm.

14:23.172 --> 14:24.586
- Liquor license,

14:24.586 --> 14:27.448
building and remodeling
permits from the city.

14:27.448 --> 14:30.689
And you realize a bigger club
means a larger insurance policy

14:30.689 --> 14:33.896
for the building
and for the employees.

14:33.896 --> 14:35.241
- Understood.

14:38.448 --> 14:42.000
- I'm happy for you, Madam.
- Thank you.

14:45.517 --> 14:50.586
- And as always, I
appreciate your discretion...

14:50.586 --> 14:52.827
and attention to detail.

14:52.827 --> 14:56.827
- Now, you know that
is the only way I work.

14:56.827 --> 14:58.344
And there are some other details

14:58.344 --> 15:00.310
I would really like
to pay attention to

15:00.310 --> 15:02.068
sometime soon, Madam.

15:04.241 --> 15:07.241
- Well, then, I'll be in touch.
- Talk soon.

15:30.965 --> 15:33.000
- Hello, sir.

16:21.965 --> 16:24.103
- Nobody's home.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.206
- Who the fuck are you?

16:33.448 --> 16:37.275
- I'm sorry.
The door was open.

16:37.275 --> 16:40.758
- No, it wasn't.
Now, who the fuck are you?

16:40.758 --> 16:44.827
- I'm a friend of
your sister, Marilyn.

16:44.827 --> 16:46.655
- So what, you here to serve me?

16:46.655 --> 16:51.620
- Ma'am?
- Or what, beat my ass?

16:51.620 --> 16:54.724
You tell that bitch that
she is not taking my father

16:54.724 --> 16:58.379
up out this house, you got that?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:58.379 --> 17:00.206
-Well, you
let her know it.

17:00.206 --> 17:02.586
She might have enough money to
bribe everybody else out there,

17:02.586 --> 17:05.137
but she ain't got
enough money for me.

17:05.137 --> 17:08.827
'Cuz I know shit.
I know plenty shit.

17:08.827 --> 17:11.344
- I'm sure, ma'am.
- Yeah, yeah, shit.

17:11.344 --> 17:13.344
Now, this my daddy too.

17:13.344 --> 17:14.689
She always wanting
to put him in a home,

17:14.689 --> 17:17.310
but he got a goddamn
home right here with me!

17:17.310 --> 17:20.379
And you let her know that.
- I see.

17:20.379 --> 17:22.241
- She want to send you
up in here in my house,

17:22.241 --> 17:24.517
I'm not gonna keep playing
these games with that bitch.

17:24.517 --> 17:27.000
She wanna go gutter,
she gonna end up in one.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.620
She got the right bitch.
Now, you tell her that!

17:30.620 --> 17:32.068
- I'll have to explain
that to your sis--

17:32.068 --> 17:33.241
- No, no, no, no, no.

17:33.241 --> 17:35.206
Now, you get your
ass out of my house.

17:35.206 --> 17:38.827
You got the message.
Go deliver it.

17:38.827 --> 17:40.482
You all right, Daddy?

17:43.137 --> 17:44.517
- Of course, ma'am.

17:59.793 --> 18:01.344
- This bitch is crazy.

18:09.689 --> 18:13.137
- Quick update. I've been
keeping an eye on Roman.

18:13.137 --> 18:16.586
I know he still hasn't paid
you that money he owe you.

18:16.586 --> 18:18.344
- Is he still in
town or did he skip?

18:18.344 --> 18:19.586
- He's still here.

18:19.586 --> 18:21.724
He's either at
home, at the casino,

18:21.724 --> 18:25.344
or some private poker
game out in Buckhead.

18:25.344 --> 18:27.517
- All right. Stay on him.

18:27.517 --> 18:29.551
Do you want me to, uh,
take one of the guys over there

18:29.551 --> 18:32.000
and send him a reminder?
Or worse?

18:32.000 --> 18:37.931
- Ooh, I would love
that, but...not right now.

18:37.931 --> 18:39.793
Not with the heat
I'm starting to get.

18:39.793 --> 18:42.586
- Heat?
- I'm not worried, okay?

18:42.586 --> 18:47.655
They have nothing.
But for now...Roman can wait.

18:47.655 --> 18:50.827
- Okay. I'll sit tight.

18:50.827 --> 18:52.551
I'mma keep an eye
on him, though.

18:52.551 --> 18:54.758
But, won't move
unless you say so.

18:54.758 --> 18:58.068
- Good. We will tend
to Roman, all right?

18:58.068 --> 19:00.448
Just not right now.

19:03.310 --> 19:07.344
- Yeah, I was just
looking at her.

19:07.344 --> 19:09.620
Keep an eye on her
from a distance.

19:09.620 --> 19:12.724
Let you know when I
think it's time to move.

19:12.724 --> 19:15.793
- Gotcha, Boss.
Standing by for Daddy duty.

19:29.310 --> 19:32.689
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:32.689 --> 19:37.620
- Well, you will be happy to
know that my nephew said yes.

19:37.620 --> 19:40.689
- Nephew?
- Are we still acting

19:40.689 --> 19:42.482
like you don't know
who I'm talking about?

19:42.482 --> 19:45.896
We doing that?
- Hm, . Him.

19:45.896 --> 19:49.931
- Yeah, him.
Him will be here tomorrow.

19:49.931 --> 19:52.379
And I want you to
show him the ropes.

19:52.379 --> 19:56.310
- Really?
- Yes.

19:56.310 --> 19:59.206
What, do you not want to?

19:59.206 --> 20:04.068
- Fine, ah, I am just not
interested like you think.

20:04.068 --> 20:07.689
- Okay.
- I'm not.

20:07.689 --> 20:10.689
- All right.
- Oh, okay.

20:10.689 --> 20:13.206
Whatever, girl.

20:13.206 --> 20:17.206
He's a good guy, all right?
- Okay, if you say so.

20:17.206 --> 20:19.931
- I know so.

20:19.931 --> 20:21.448
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:23.517 --> 20:28.275
I'll be in my office.
Thank you.

20:37.551 --> 20:39.655
- It's gonna be 500.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.206
I told her, "You want
me to pick you up?

20:41.206 --> 20:43.034
Guess what, it's gonna be fine."

20:48.482 --> 20:50.482
- What the--

20:55.137 --> 20:56.517
- I know that ain't no
motherfucking junior dancer

20:56.517 --> 20:58.275
walking to the back.

20:58.275 --> 20:59.862
- Is this nigga pissing?

21:08.793 --> 21:10.379
- Yo bitch ass
do know junior dancers

21:10.379 --> 21:12.241
go on the other side, right?

21:12.241 --> 21:14.034
- Nigga, you can't hear?

21:15.862 --> 21:17.689
- What's going on?

21:19.827 --> 21:22.379
- He walked his
bitch ass up in here.

21:22.379 --> 21:24.482
- Hey, uh uh, stop.

21:24.482 --> 21:26.344
When you start making
this kind of money,

21:26.344 --> 21:28.241
then you can come on this side.

21:28.241 --> 21:31.758
Until then, take your
ass on the other side.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.310
Thank you.

21:33.310 --> 21:35.310
-Do that shit
again and I'mma fuck you up.

21:35.310 --> 21:36.586
- Face, calm down.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.344
It's not even that
serious, okay?

21:38.344 --> 21:40.655
It's a mistake.

21:40.655 --> 21:44.275
You all ready for roll call?
-Yes, ma'am.

21:44.275 --> 21:45.620
- Move, Fuego. I know your ass

21:45.620 --> 21:47.241
didn't bring
those fucking donuts in here.

21:47.241 --> 21:48.827
That shit ain't money, okay?

21:48.827 --> 21:50.931
We here to make
money, eat later.

21:50.931 --> 21:52.413
- I know.
-Thank you.

21:52.413 --> 21:53.689
- I'm sorry.

21:53.689 --> 21:55.827
And you know we
still need to talk.

21:55.827 --> 21:58.586
- Yes, Madam.

21:58.586 --> 22:01.517
- Why you ain't dressed?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

22:01.517 --> 22:02.862
- I'm good.

22:02.862 --> 22:06.862
- What the fuck is wrong?
- Nothin'.

22:06.862 --> 22:09.103
- All right.
You'll tell me.

22:13.482 --> 22:14.965
Where is Doc?

22:18.103 --> 22:20.758
Look, get y'all's
shit together, okay?

22:20.758 --> 22:22.758
Let's get out here
and get this money.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.586
- Yes--
- Yes, Madam.

22:36.275 --> 22:37.655
- Madam?
- Hm?

22:37.655 --> 22:41.344
- Little fat man is here.
He wants to talk.

22:41.344 --> 22:43.000
- Let him in.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.689
-Piece?

22:49.862 --> 22:51.655
You'll get it back
when you leave.

22:56.275 --> 23:00.310
- Gene...
- Madam.

23:00.310 --> 23:02.137
Good to see you.

23:03.896 --> 23:06.103
Think we can talk
alone for a minute?

23:06.103 --> 23:09.103
- I think you should get to
the reason why you're here.

23:09.103 --> 23:11.206
Time is money.

23:11.206 --> 23:15.034
- Okay, I'll cut straight to it.

23:15.034 --> 23:19.586
I wanted to give you an
opportunity to reconsider.

23:19.586 --> 23:21.137
- Why would I do that?

23:21.137 --> 23:24.275
- I've been working on this
huge multi-property deal.

23:24.275 --> 23:26.689
I want you to be a part of it.

23:26.689 --> 23:30.448
You gotta admit,
we were a good team.

23:30.448 --> 23:33.896
And this place is
the final piece.

23:37.517 --> 23:38.862
- I need you.

23:41.241 --> 23:44.931
I need you to get on board.

23:44.931 --> 23:46.896
- This is a fuckin' joke, right?

23:46.896 --> 23:49.344
You have
to be kidding me.

23:49.344 --> 23:52.517
- Look, I know you all up
in your feelings about

23:52.517 --> 23:56.034
what happened before.

23:56.034 --> 23:58.551
We don't need to
go down this road.

23:58.551 --> 24:02.620
We got history.
We can make this work.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.344
Look, I'll go through the books,

24:06.344 --> 24:08.000
figure out what I owe you
from before, and we can--

24:08.000 --> 24:10.655
- No, you won't. You won't.

24:10.655 --> 24:12.758
And you don't even
believe that shit.

24:12.758 --> 24:15.689
That's the same lame-ass
line you gave me before.

24:15.689 --> 24:19.172
The only difference is
now, Gene, I'm the boss.

24:19.172 --> 24:21.827
And what I say goes.

24:21.827 --> 24:25.896
And I say no. Period.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.758
- See, this?

24:30.758 --> 24:33.724
This is exactly what
I'm talking about.

24:33.724 --> 24:37.965
That old angry
Black woman syndrome.

24:37.965 --> 24:40.137
Maybe Allen can talk
some sense into you.

24:40.137 --> 24:43.379
Sometimes you women get
all caught up emotionally

24:43.379 --> 24:45.517
over business matters.

24:45.517 --> 24:48.724
That's why you usually don't
make good business partners.

24:48.724 --> 24:50.517
It's all that estrogen.

24:51.827 --> 24:55.103
- And there he goes.

24:55.103 --> 24:57.448
Same old Gene.

24:57.448 --> 25:00.241
Little fat male chauvinist.

25:00.241 --> 25:05.931
- Madam...you don't wanna
start this war with me.

25:05.931 --> 25:11.413
- I'm not starting it.
I'm winning.

25:11.413 --> 25:15.896
Now, I think it's time
for you to get the fuck out.

25:18.344 --> 25:20.137
Stop wasting my time, Gene.

25:28.724 --> 25:32.827
- I'm not done talking.

25:32.827 --> 25:35.655
- You heard her.
It's time to go.

25:38.724 --> 25:40.655
- What? I'm supposed to be
afraid of

25:40.655 --> 25:42.206
your little lesbian muscle
over here?

25:43.448 --> 25:46.482
- Oh, don't be afraid,
Gene, be smart.

25:46.482 --> 25:50.931
- You know, I really don't feel
like breaking a sweat tonight.

25:50.931 --> 25:55.586
She said what she said. Leave.

25:59.448 --> 26:01.931
You been asked multiple
times to leave the premises.

26:01.931 --> 26:03.482
You are now trespassing.

26:03.482 --> 26:05.793
You have 30 seconds
to leave the building,

26:05.793 --> 26:08.448
or you'll be treated
as a burglar.

26:08.448 --> 26:12.655
See? I gotta make sure
that there's a record of you

26:12.655 --> 26:15.344
being asked to leave.

26:15.344 --> 26:20.448
That way, in case I
have to shoot you, Gene--

26:20.448 --> 26:24.206
which I would enjoy--
I won't go to jail.

26:32.965 --> 26:34.965
- This ain't over.

26:34.965 --> 26:37.137
- For your sake, it better be.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.413
Don't get buried out back.

26:40.413 --> 26:43.310
Now get the fuck out
of my club, Gene.

26:56.241 --> 27:00.103
-I see why you can't
stand that motherfucker. Shit!

27:00.103 --> 27:02.310
You know he hates it when you
call him that little fat man.

27:02.310 --> 27:03.310
- I do.

27:03.310 --> 27:04.758
Why do you think
I keep doing it?

27:04.758 --> 27:08.137
Fuck him.
- I am here for it.

27:16.517 --> 27:19.000
Motherfucking girl boss.

27:23.034 --> 27:24.758
- All hail the queen.

27:28.517 --> 27:33.000
-It's about to get
hot up in here tonight, okay?

27:36.034 --> 27:38.620
And the fellas
are gonna be on the floor

27:38.620 --> 27:40.689
dancing for your pleasure.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.517
- Come to sugar mama,
baby, down here.

28:15.517 --> 28:20.137
Yes. Mm.

28:27.068 --> 28:31.586
- Ooh, yes! Ooh!

28:31.586 --> 28:34.413
You know how I like it.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.620
Come one, put some umph into
this, baby.

28:36.620 --> 28:38.137
What you doing?

28:46.793 --> 28:49.620
- Good evening, Ms. Patty.
- Hey!

28:49.620 --> 28:52.758
- Do you mind if I borrow
Babyface for just a second?

28:52.758 --> 28:53.827
He'll be back.

28:53.827 --> 28:56.000
- Okay.
- Come here.

29:09.517 --> 29:11.724
- What the fuck is going
on with that, Face, huh?

29:11.724 --> 29:15.862
Your ass would've been there all
night if I didn't rescue you.

29:15.862 --> 29:17.931
- I mean, I give her extra
attention here and there,

29:17.931 --> 29:20.586
and she is extra
generous financially.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.413
- Don't bullshit me.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.275
What the fuck is going on?

29:27.275 --> 29:30.931
- All right, she pays
for my car, my apartment.

29:30.931 --> 29:34.137
Shit, extra cash when I need it.

29:34.137 --> 29:36.413
- Do you have to jump
when she says jump?

29:38.620 --> 29:44.413
Look, now, you can continue
being miserable as a kept man,

29:44.413 --> 29:46.689
or you can start to
pay your own way.

29:46.689 --> 29:50.206
You are too old for this shit.

29:50.206 --> 29:55.034
- I know. I don't really know
how to do anything else.

29:55.034 --> 29:56.310
- I can throw you
in the private parties

29:56.310 --> 29:58.000
with the rest of the guys.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.551
You will make more than enough
money to take care of yourself.

30:03.103 --> 30:05.206
- All right.

30:05.206 --> 30:08.068
I'll end things
with her tomorrow.

30:08.068 --> 30:12.137
- Why wait?
- Honestly?

30:12.137 --> 30:13.586
I have clothes and
stuff at her place,

30:13.586 --> 30:16.034
and I don't want her to
bleach or burn my things.

30:16.034 --> 30:18.758
You know that bitch crazy.

30:18.758 --> 30:21.793
- I know. All right.

30:21.793 --> 30:23.965
I'm glad that that's settled.

30:23.965 --> 30:26.310
Go out there and
make us some money.

30:26.310 --> 30:29.931
Hey, let her down easy, okay?

30:29.931 --> 30:34.482
She is one of my regulars
and I do want her coming back.

30:34.482 --> 30:36.862
- Gotcha.
- Go make some money.

30:53.241 --> 30:56.448
- You know that
shit ain't allowed.

30:56.448 --> 30:57.413
- Sorry, Madam.

31:00.103 --> 31:04.344
- You good?
- Yeah. I'm good.

31:06.965 --> 31:11.275
- Have you seen her?
- No.

31:11.275 --> 31:13.137
I ain't no weak-ass nigga.

31:15.034 --> 31:16.379
Just watching that shit

31:16.379 --> 31:21.482
splattered all over
the damn wall...

31:21.482 --> 31:23.586
That was his fucking
brains getting blasted

31:23.586 --> 31:27.034
out the back of his head.

31:27.034 --> 31:29.689
Look, I done been
through some shit.

31:33.137 --> 31:37.793
I'm a street kid.
I ain't got no daddy.

31:37.793 --> 31:41.758
My mother was on drugs and shit.

31:41.758 --> 31:45.413
Straight-up stereotype
of a Black man in America.

31:48.103 --> 31:50.137
But his fucking brains?

31:53.103 --> 31:58.758
- Was that your first time?
- First time?

31:58.758 --> 32:03.724
- Doc...my grandmother was
the ultimate queen, okay?

32:03.724 --> 32:08.758
She ran everything.
Taught me everything I know.

32:08.758 --> 32:10.413
My daddy was a gangster.

32:10.413 --> 32:14.655
- Yeah. I know.
- Okay.

32:14.655 --> 32:18.862
Well, what you
don't know is my daddy

32:18.862 --> 32:23.068
went to prison when I was 14.

32:23.068 --> 32:26.344
My grandmother got very sick.

32:26.344 --> 32:32.344
So...I started
pimpin' hoes at 14.

32:32.344 --> 32:36.758
- Wow.
- The shit that I've done...

32:36.758 --> 32:40.758
the shit that I have seen...

32:40.758 --> 32:43.517
me shooting that motherfucker
in the back of his head was me

32:43.517 --> 32:46.862
doing that nigga a favor, okay?

32:46.862 --> 32:49.517
Motherfucker lucky I wasn't
in a torture kind of a mood.

32:53.517 --> 32:56.241
That motherfucker came
after what's mine.

32:56.241 --> 33:01.206
That shit sends me.
You are mine, okay?

33:01.206 --> 33:04.689
- Thanks, Madam.
- No, all y'all niggas are mine.

33:04.689 --> 33:07.724
The kind of money we make, the
way we look out for each other?

33:07.724 --> 33:10.793
- That's right.
I mean, I'm a real-ass nigga.

33:10.793 --> 33:12.689
- I know.
- I'd ride and die for you.

33:12.689 --> 33:14.241
- I know that.

33:14.241 --> 33:17.034
- Me, all the guys in the
damn locker room, like,

33:17.034 --> 33:21.586
for real--Midnight,
Face, me, Fuego.

33:21.586 --> 33:24.103
Just don't hold that
shit against me. Like--

33:24.103 --> 33:28.793
- Look, it is over, okay?

33:28.793 --> 33:30.379
It's over.

33:30.379 --> 33:34.344
- Look, if it come down to it...

33:34.344 --> 33:36.344
I'll take care of her myself.

33:36.344 --> 33:39.206
Just to show you
where I stand at.

33:39.206 --> 33:43.793
- That's good to know.
But I got her.

33:43.793 --> 33:45.206
Let's get back inside.

33:45.206 --> 33:47.689
Show these motherfuckers
why we are number one.

33:47.689 --> 33:49.137
Put this shit out.

33:51.068 --> 33:53.172
That's some whack-ass weed.

34:13.103 --> 34:16.586
- Midnight, what are you doing?

34:16.586 --> 34:18.793
- I can't do it, Madam.
- What do you mean?

34:20.413 --> 34:22.413
- Look, I went to the doctor.

34:22.413 --> 34:25.931
And they gon' tell me
I gotta stop beefing.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.793
- Why?

34:27.793 --> 34:30.068
- I guess my shit's
starting to die.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.689
- Let me see.

34:39.103 --> 34:40.758
- Madam, I don't
know what to do.

34:40.758 --> 34:42.482
This is my money.
This is my life.

34:42.482 --> 34:44.931
- I know, but Night,
think about it.

34:44.931 --> 34:50.862
You could lose your dick, okay?
Stop tying it off.

34:50.862 --> 34:52.827
- What am I supposed to do?
Just not get paid?

34:52.827 --> 34:54.517
- Night!

34:54.517 --> 34:56.137
- Nah, it's too much
money out there.

34:58.586 --> 35:00.517
I'm getting this money.

35:00.517 --> 35:04.172
- Okay, um, try this.

35:04.172 --> 35:07.551
Just don't keep it tied
off for as long, okay?

35:07.551 --> 35:09.137
Look, I've seen
this shit happen.

35:09.137 --> 35:12.241
And you can
actually lose your dick.

35:12.241 --> 35:15.172
- Okay.
-I mean it.

35:15.172 --> 35:17.172
- I got you.
Now, can I finish?

35:19.413 --> 35:20.827
- Look, if this shit gets
worse--

35:20.827 --> 35:23.551
- Madam, I got you.
Now, can I finish?

35:25.068 --> 35:26.551
- All right.

35:35.793 --> 35:39.172
- My god.

35:45.551 --> 35:47.862
- Get them cash cannons ready.

35:47.862 --> 35:49.448
And give it up!

35:49.448 --> 35:53.793
Give it up for these
blazing hot brothers, them.

35:55.931 --> 35:57.379
Bambaclat!

37:46.758 --> 37:49.310
- You got a VIP.
- Damn.

38:06.655 --> 38:10.827
- What the fuck is that?
- I'm sorry.

38:10.827 --> 38:12.000
- You were back
there for two hours.

38:12.000 --> 38:17.068
Did this bitch not pay you?
- No.

38:17.068 --> 38:19.655
- Tell me why and tell
me right the fuck now.

38:21.482 --> 38:23.172
- She's a judge.

38:23.172 --> 38:26.827
She's handling a case
with my baby mother.

38:26.827 --> 38:28.896
- Nigga, you not paying
your child support?

38:28.896 --> 38:30.379
- I'm trying.

38:30.379 --> 38:33.068
- I don't like the
IRS in my shit.

38:33.068 --> 38:36.034
Pay that bitch and get
her off your fucking back.

38:36.034 --> 38:38.517
- But she spends the money
on red bottoms and shit.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.655
- That is the small
fucking picture.

38:40.655 --> 38:41.965
Who gives a fuck
about red bottoms?

38:41.965 --> 38:43.793
This is the big picture.
You see this shit?

38:43.793 --> 38:46.862
This is the big fucking picture.

38:46.862 --> 38:49.655
So you brought a
judge into my shit.

38:49.655 --> 38:53.275
And you fucking her
upstairs in my VIP room?

38:53.275 --> 38:55.068
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

38:55.068 --> 38:56.724
- Nigga, it's not
a fucking question.

38:56.724 --> 39:00.068
I know that you're doing it
and I'm asking you why.

39:00.068 --> 39:02.517
Why?

39:02.517 --> 39:05.137
- I don't wanna go to jail.

39:05.137 --> 39:07.793
- Jail? What is she doing,
blackmailing you?

39:10.103 --> 39:15.517
- Yes.
- Really?

39:15.517 --> 39:20.586
Oh. Okay. Okay.

39:20.586 --> 39:23.103
It's cool. Go home.

39:23.103 --> 39:26.551
And pay that bitch.
- Yes, Madam.

39:37.758 --> 39:41.517
- I can handle it.
I just won't let her back in.

39:41.517 --> 39:44.793
- No. Let her in.

39:44.793 --> 39:47.000
- Okay.
- Did she valet?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.275
-Yes.

39:49.275 --> 39:53.206
- Okay. Okay.

39:53.206 --> 39:56.965
I could use this shit.
I swear to fuck I can use this.

39:56.965 --> 39:58.896
- Now, you know I love it
when you talk like this.

39:58.896 --> 40:03.275
-All right, take care.

40:03.275 --> 40:06.137
- Mm-hmm. You know me.

40:30.379 --> 40:32.000
- Daddy?

40:34.379 --> 40:36.000
Daddy?

40:38.896 --> 40:40.551
Daddy?

40:41.758 --> 40:44.103
Fuck is he. Daddy?

40:51.827 --> 40:53.000
Keep on doing this shit.

40:58.724 --> 41:02.310
- Hello, Marilyn?

41:02.310 --> 41:04.413
I know you got Daddy.

41:04.413 --> 41:07.413
I'mma give you 24 hours to get
him back over into this house

41:07.413 --> 41:11.206
before I call the police and
tell them exactly what you did.

41:23.620 --> 41:25.827
- Have you ever been swimming?

41:32.827 --> 41:34.344
- Do you know how?
