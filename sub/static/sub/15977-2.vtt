WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:07.671
Point of origin is 186 centimeters
from the wall.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.923
After consulting the surgeon,
it was determined that

00:09.968 --> 00:12.801
the bullet struck Kyle Stansbury's
head at a negative 17-degree angle,

00:12.930 --> 00:15.046
and exited with a negative
28-degree trajectory.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.426
Based on the position
of the victim's body,

00:17.518 --> 00:19.975
our ballistics test indicate
that the point of impact

00:20.020 --> 00:23.433
between the bullet and the victim
was 106 centimeters from the ground.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.855
About three and a half feet.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.190
So Kyle was on his
knees when he got shot?

00:27.194 --> 00:29.105
Very likely.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.400
- Execution style.
- Or he was on his knees

00:32.491 --> 00:35.608
because he was sorry about what he
did and was about to off himself.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.534
There were two guns.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.950
The army of one could've
ditched the other Nina

00:39.998 --> 00:41.784
before he came to his senses.

00:42.501 --> 00:47.495
The SID report said that there were no
GSR traces on either hand of the victim.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.840
Um... Uh...

00:53.011 --> 00:57.095
Is that, um, consistent with other
suicides you've dealt with before?

00:57.182 --> 00:58.718
It's not uncommon.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.512
The hand closest to the
9-millimeter was in a pool of blood.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.845
Any gunshot residue could
have been contaminated.

01:05.023 --> 01:08.641
Scientifically speaking, Doc, did he
off himself or did someone else do it?

01:08.735 --> 01:12.193
Our ballistics tests were not able
to positively determine the distance

01:12.281 --> 01:17.571
from which the gun was fired, so it
could be either a homicide or a suicide.

01:17.661 --> 01:18.821
For real?

01:18.870 --> 01:22.112
You got all this fancy-ass sci-fi
shit and that's all you can tell me?

01:25.043 --> 01:28.956
We're dealing with a very scientifically
unique situation here, Detective.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.178
Jesus Christ, Linden.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.844
You gotta keep it together.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.728
At least in public.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.812
Bethany showed up at my house
last night looking for her dad.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.520
I told her I didn't know where
he was, but she didn't believe me.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.443
So what?

01:57.534 --> 02:00.321
She's just some stupid kid
whose parents have got problems.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.820
- Nobody's gonna believe her.
- She knows I'm lying.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.246
She's not gonna give up.

02:07.336 --> 02:08.576
Calm down.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.912
Calm down.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.217
We're good. Okay? Trust me.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.389
Linden. Linden.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.970
S04E02
Unraveling

03:32.212 --> 03:34.294
Ten-hut!

03:46.059 --> 03:48.391
At ease, cadets. Have a seat.

03:52.858 --> 03:57.192
By now, you're all well
aware that a tragic event

03:57.279 --> 04:01.067
has befallen your fellow
cadet, Kyle Stansbury,

04:01.158 --> 04:02.523
and his family.

04:03.034 --> 04:08.279
Today, Cadet Stansbury will be
rejoining us here at St. George's.

04:09.249 --> 04:13.492
On this campus, we are a family.

04:13.837 --> 04:17.295
What happens to one of
us happens to all of us.

04:17.674 --> 04:21.508
And as a family,
we will all move forward.

04:21.595 --> 04:25.338
I expect all of you to help your
brother reacclimate to life here,

04:25.807 --> 04:30.346
and grant him the respect he
deserves in the wake of this tragedy.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.852
Yes, cadet?

04:33.690 --> 04:36.602
Ma'am, didn't he do it, ma'am?

04:39.488 --> 04:42.025
Let me make this clear

04:42.115 --> 04:45.152
because I will not repeat myself.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.827
Any stories or rumors you've heard

04:48.955 --> 04:55.451
about cadet Stansbury's involvement
in this incident have no merit.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.163
Civilians outside these walls

04:59.257 --> 05:03.341
ground their lives in
presumption and supposition,

05:04.054 --> 05:06.921
instead of discipline and purpose.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.222
But at St. George's,

05:09.768 --> 05:12.601
we hold ourselves to a higher standard.

05:13.021 --> 05:18.766
We live our lives according
to a code of truth,

05:18.860 --> 05:23.194
duty, honor and integrity.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.815
Make no mistake, cadets.

05:27.285 --> 05:33.451
Anyone who defies my orders will be
dealt with in the most severe fashion.

05:33.542 --> 05:38.502
There is now a new
zero-tolerance policy in effect

05:38.588 --> 05:40.294
at St. George's.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.080
Is my message clear?

05:42.175 --> 05:44.040
Ma'am, yes, ma'am!

05:45.470 --> 05:47.847
Battalion, all rise for vespers.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.593
Ten-hut.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.609
Jesus Christ, man.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.653
You're even more of a fucking freak now.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.816
You seriously don't remember
shit from that night?

06:12.581 --> 06:14.321
It's okay, buddy.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.415
Amnesia's a bitch.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.332
Heard your little sis took
it right in the face, though.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.921
Too bad.

06:24.009 --> 06:27.342
She was gonna be one fine
piece of pussy one day.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.484
911, what's your emergency?

06:48.575 --> 06:51.237
I heard gunshots, six or seven of them.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.160
They're coming from the Stansbury house.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.784
- Sir, do you have an address?
- Yes, I do.

06:56.917 --> 07:00.375
They reside at 8327 Ferndell Lane.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.286
Emmet Deschler, neighbor.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.714
He sounds so calm, like he's ordering
takeout instead of calling in a...

07:06.718 --> 07:09.255
shooUng.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.551
Those ballistics reports
are inconclusive. Let it go.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.842
We can't charge Kyle, and you know it.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.269
Religion's inconclusive.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.439
Don't stop five billion people
believing what they believe.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.265
God is not the DA.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.314
So let's just do our job
and go talk to this neighbor.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.782
Right now, he is the only lead we have.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.824
What the hell are you guys doing
in here, playing Deer Hunter?

07:33.954 --> 07:37.037
Case of Rolling Rock says
Linden blows her head off first.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.784
Let's go.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.033
One shot, Linden. One shot.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.618
Yo, Holder, do me a solid, will you?

07:43.713 --> 07:46.375
Take these Pied Piper case
files home to your girlfriend.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.416
I don't wanna schlep my ass all
the way over to city hall again.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.842
Yeah.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.761
Sure.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.809
- Oh, I got my hands full.
- Oh, that's funny.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.769
- Shit.
- Asshole.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.727
That's premium roast,
you prick. You owe me.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.025
Yeah, it is. It is.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.818
Fucker.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.415
Jesus Christ.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.119
Ah...

08:44.649 --> 08:48.688
How long have you been neighbors
with the Stansburys, Mr. Deschler?

08:48.778 --> 08:53.488
I moved back about 10 years ago
to look after my ailing mother.

08:53.491 --> 08:57.530
She passed a few years later
and I inherited the house.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.123
You can see the Stansbury house from
here. Do you know the family well?

09:03.126 --> 09:05.708
I was introduced to them
years ago by my mother.

09:05.795 --> 09:10.209
But other than seeing them at the market
on occasion, no, I didn't know them.

09:11.009 --> 09:15.252
I generally eschew formal
engagements and social gatherings.

09:15.972 --> 09:19.305
Yeah, you look like you haven't
flown the coop in a while.

09:20.477 --> 09:24.811
By nature,
artists are sometimes invalids.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.390
My home is my camera obscura.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.393
So I'm not gonna find a Velvet
Elvis hanging anywhere around here?

09:31.404 --> 09:35.192
No. I believe that pain
and suffering is true art.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.533
A physical replication,
regardless of medium.

09:38.828 --> 09:39.943
Is that right?

09:40.038 --> 09:43.496
Happiness creates a laziness
which allows us to forget.

09:43.541 --> 09:48.410
But pain teaches us a lesson
which forces us to grow.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.463
On the night of the murders

09:52.550 --> 09:56.668
can you describe to me what you were
doing immediately before you dialed 911?

09:56.763 --> 09:58.549
I already spoke to the other officers.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.714
They appeared to be
writing down my words.

10:00.725 --> 10:04.092
They did. I'd like to hear it from
you in case they missed something.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.225
I was sitting right here,
looking out the window.

10:08.274 --> 10:12.108
And I was startled by half
a dozen or so loud bangs.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.235
Like someone was hunting.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.647
For someone who was startled, you
sounded very calm on the phone.

10:17.700 --> 10:23.536
Do that a lot? Just sit there and stare
out at nothing at 5:00 in the morning?

10:23.832 --> 10:25.618
It's not nothing.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.499
It's beautiful.

10:29.003 --> 10:32.086
She said so herself.
I assume you meant it.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.048
That's still a long way
to hear a 9-millimeter.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.797
It's not exactly a hand cannon.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.760
It's very quiet around here.

10:39.806 --> 10:43.390
Any kind of loud noise echoes
and carries across the water,

10:43.434 --> 10:45.425
especially at night.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.267
You told the 911 operator that the shots
were coming from the Stansbury house.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.685
How could you be so sure?

10:51.734 --> 10:53.816
Theirs was the only light on.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.571
In your statement, you never mentioned
the lights were on in the house.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.992
They never asked.

10:59.993 --> 11:04.282
And the lights weren't on in the
house. They were on in the beach house.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.117
That's where I assumed
the shots were coming from.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.376
I never come out here.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.546
Mr. Stansbury is very specific.
I don't clean the beach house.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.965
- Did he say why?
- No.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.212
And I don't ask.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.885
You afraid of him?

11:20.972 --> 11:22.178
No.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.551
They always paid me on time.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.974
There's just nothing for me to do.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.926
The house is always clean.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.262
Top to bottom.

11:30.356 --> 11:34.599
With three kids you always
see a mess. Not the Stansburys.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.526
Nothing was out of place, ever.

11:37.614 --> 11:40.196
It's like nobody lived here.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.025
- Only ghosts.
- Thank you.

11:47.582 --> 11:52.076
- Unis did a sweep?
- Cursory. Nothing to write home about.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.004
What do you think?

12:05.099 --> 12:06.680
I think Boo Radley over there

12:06.726 --> 12:09.718
is one sunny day away
from cutting his ear off.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.728
No forced entry, locked from the inside.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.686
If somebody was here, they had a key.

12:21.783 --> 12:25.446
That guy's a fucking weirdo.
Let's run a check on him.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.364
We'll call SID to have
them dust for prints.

12:30.458 --> 12:34.451
Maybe there was a motion sensor
that went off or something.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.611
Boom, boom.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.033
- Welcome back, cadet.
- Thank you, ma'am.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.494
There were no complications
with your release from the hospital?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.962
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

13:20.216 --> 13:24.300
Now that you're back on campus,
focus could be on the future.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.722
As your legal guardian, I'm
prepared to take the necessary steps

13:29.767 --> 13:32.429
to ensure your full recovery.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.144
Your class schedule
will remain the same.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.768
You will be excused from any kind of PT.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.934
And your new living quarters
will be located in the infirmary

13:41.029 --> 13:42.769
where a nurse will be on duty.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.983
You will be meeting with
a psychologist once a week.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.531
With all due respect, ma'am, I
prefer to return to the barracks.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.199
I don't need to speak to a psychologist.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.994
That stuff's 90 percent bullshit,
anyways.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.825
Excuse me, cadet?

13:58.796 --> 14:01.333
I'm not a victim. I don't
wanna be treated like one.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.791
I don't know how much you remember
about your time here, cadet.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.877
But you didn't fit in.

14:06.971 --> 14:11.214
Boys can be the cruelest animals
and they will cut you no slack now.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.431
I recall what it was like

14:12.518 --> 14:15.806
but it will be worse for me if you
turn me into a charity case, ma'am.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.436
Do you remember the
night of the murders?

14:28.409 --> 14:29.819
No.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.111
I spent every moment in
the hospital trying to.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.450
They say it's better ifI don't.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.162
You could be right.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.088
Ahem. The academy has made arrangements

14:44.175 --> 14:46.382
for funeral services to
take place on Wednesday.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.926
I'd like to see them before
then, ma'am, say my goodbyes.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.504
I'm sorry, that's not possible.

14:51.599 --> 14:55.683
They were shot at close range.
It's a closed casket service.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.970
I'm sorry. I thought
you were aware of that.

15:06.572 --> 15:10.656
Then like you said, ma'am, it's even
more critical that I focus on my future,

15:10.743 --> 15:13.701
and be treated the same
as any other cadet.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.533
You'll return to the barracks.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.459
Don't make me regret my decision.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.458
I won't, ma'am.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.040
Dismissed.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.771
Maybe Little Miss Perfect
was sneaking out at night.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.022
Hitting the clubs

15:47.029 --> 15:49.566
and then she stashed her party clothes
down at the beach house

15:49.615 --> 15:50.866
so papa wouldn't find them.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.282
That doesn't seem like her style.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.532
What the hell do you
know about style, Linden?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.451
Thought you shopped at
Ross Dress for Less?

15:59.542 --> 16:02.079
At least I don't get my
clothes at the Goodwill.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.333
Hey, you find anything you like
in there, you take it for a spin.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.256
Extreme Makeover, Linden Edition.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.633
These styles don't match.

16:18.186 --> 16:19.551
Not the sizes, either.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.057
One's a little country,
one's a little rock 'n' roll.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.513
- You?
- No.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.225
Phoebe's a four, these are an eight.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.569
What about the mom's?

16:31.365 --> 16:33.777
No, she's the same size as her daughter.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.568
These clothes belong to somebody else.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.328
I'm gonna run these down to SID.

16:43.419 --> 16:46.582
Have them run a print
on the bag and the belt.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.560
Hey, take a look at these.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.725
What the fuck?

17:11.697 --> 17:14.985
Miss Model Citizen ain't all discipline.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.747
Yeah, she's posing for these.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.103
Did you find anything at
the Stansbury's beach house?

17:49.193 --> 17:51.775
No, but we found these in
Phoebe Stansbury's room.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.697
She kept them.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.905
I knew she loved them. I knew it.

18:07.545 --> 18:11.163
Is someone in the house, Mr.
Deschler? You need to come with us.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.997
You don't understand. Phoebe and I,
we had a special relationship.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.216
- Down on your knees.
- Down on your knees!

18:15.303 --> 18:17.760
Put your hands behind your neck.
Behind your neck.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.384
You don't understand.
Those photos, they were special.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.339
- Shut the fuck up.
- Keep him down here!

18:22.435 --> 18:25.017
- Can't go up there!
- Shut up!

18:26.314 --> 18:27.804
Shut your mouth.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.977
Shut up!

18:30.067 --> 18:34.026
- I know my rights, and you can't...
- Shut the fuck up.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.063
You don't understand.
Phoebe and I, we had a connection.

18:37.158 --> 18:40.070
You don't understand.
She wanted to be seen...

18:40.161 --> 18:42.277
Shut the fuck up!

19:02.725 --> 19:04.135
Holder!

19:04.268 --> 19:06.384
No, no.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.554
No, she's mine, not yours! She's mine!

19:29.126 --> 19:30.662
Holy shit.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.362
What the fuck you two
faggots laughing at?

20:46.454 --> 20:49.821
Tommy finger-blasted Jenny Becker
in the Sonic bathroom Saturday night.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.198
No fucking way.

20:52.293 --> 20:56.411
Whoa! Little Tommy getting
to be quite the man.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.417
Way to get your name in the
box score, bud. Good job.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.218
Oh, shit. Everyone, look.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.803
Carrie got her period.

21:10.561 --> 21:14.145
- Oh, shit.
- Look, Stansbury's he's bleeding.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.022
What a pussy.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.772
Need a tampon to plug up
your slash, little girl?

21:20.821 --> 21:23.358
- The bitch is on heavy flow this month.
- Get him a maxi pad.

21:23.532 --> 21:26.774
- The little baby's gonna cry.
- That's enough!

21:28.412 --> 21:30.949
What, you think that's funny, huh?

21:32.833 --> 21:35.370
Finish up your business
and get out of here.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.257
Maintain the pressure, all right?

21:47.306 --> 21:50.469
Clean yourself up. I'll let the
infirmary know you're on your way.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.810
As I said, I'm more than happy
to assist in your investigation.

21:57.858 --> 22:01.100
But I need to be present for any
conversations you have with my students.

22:01.195 --> 22:04.278
Fine. As long as you understand
that in the event we go to court,

22:04.281 --> 22:06.397
I may need to subpoena you as a witness.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.481
Understood.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.117
Enter.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.748
Cadet Stansbury reporting
as ordered, ma'am.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.702
The detectives would like to
ask you some further questions.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.081
Ma'am.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.121
Sir, ma'am.

22:22.383 --> 22:24.214
Take a seat, cadet.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.253
How are you feeling, Kyle?

22:29.306 --> 22:31.137
Much better, thank you, ma'am.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.305
Good.

22:33.435 --> 22:36.222
Do you know if anyone was
staying in the beach house?

22:36.313 --> 22:39.646
Friend, or guest of the family, maybe?

22:39.733 --> 22:41.394
No, ma'am, I do not.

22:41.485 --> 22:45.273
So you never had some sweet,
little thing over for some

22:45.322 --> 22:47.608
late night Marco Polo?

22:48.993 --> 22:53.111
- No, I did not, sir.
- You've had a traumatic experience.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.742
Memories get buried
and need to be dug out.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.782
So just try to think, Kyle.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.500
I do not know if anyone was
staying in that beach house.

23:00.671 --> 23:03.413
You got your answer. Is there
more you need, Detectives?

23:03.507 --> 23:06.044
What was your relationship
like with your sister?

23:06.844 --> 23:10.428
- Nadine?
- No. Your other sister, Phoebe.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.507
She was fine. We were fine. Why?

23:22.818 --> 23:26.185
- What are you doing?
- This is part of our investigation.

23:30.326 --> 23:34.035
We found these pictures
in your sister's bedroom.

23:34.830 --> 23:38.823
Do you know the man who lives across the
lake from your house, Emmett Deschler?

23:38.959 --> 23:41.746
- No.
- I think that's enough, Detectives.

23:41.795 --> 23:43.126
We're just getting answers.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.163
You've got them, so we're done here.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.710
- You knew about this?
- Cadet, you're dismissed.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.177
No, please.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.218
We're trying to help. If you know
anything about Emmett Deschler,

23:52.222 --> 23:54.087
- anything at all...
- Cadet.

23:54.141 --> 23:57.008
I didn't know there were pictures.
Um...

23:57.728 --> 24:00.970
I saw Phoebe one night, she was standing
in front of her window like that,

24:01.065 --> 24:03.977
and I told her that anybody
could see inside her room

24:04.068 --> 24:06.229
but it was like she wanted to be seen.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.776
Did you tell anyone?

24:08.280 --> 24:11.363
Heh. My parents. They didn't believe me.

24:12.409 --> 24:17.324
Phoebe was their favorite. You
know, she couldn't do anything wrong.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.288
Not like me.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.917
After I told on her,
she cut the piano wires.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.416
They didn't even get
mad at her for that.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.585
Piano was yours?

24:30.260 --> 24:34.344
Yeah. I should've just shut up.
I should've... I should've known.

24:34.431 --> 24:38.720
My parents didn't believe anything I
said. They didn't care about me, so...

24:42.773 --> 24:45.515
Did Emmett have a
relationship with your sister?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.602
I don't know.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.063
I'm feeling a little sick.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.695
Cadet Stansbury needs to get
some rest. We're done here.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.279
Cadet, you're dismissed.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.165
He didn't do it.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.037
Do you believe that now?

25:30.195 --> 25:33.107
I don't care. I'm his daughter.
I need to talk to him.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.654
There must be something you can do.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.983
I'm sorry. Lieutenant Skinner
isn't here.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.823
- I can't help you.
- I got this, Mike.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.613
Bethany, how's it going? You okay?

25:42.708 --> 25:45.575
Detective Reddick, I
can't find my dad anywhere.

25:45.669 --> 25:49.002
I keep texting and calling, but he
hasn't texted me back in two weeks.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.501
- Doesn't make sense.
- Have you talked to your mom?

25:51.925 --> 25:55.383
She doesn't care. She's
basically glad he's gone.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.428
How long has it been
since you've seen your dad?

25:58.432 --> 26:00.218
Like, two weeks.

26:01.101 --> 26:04.184
He's with that bitch, his old partner.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.807
- Linden?
- She's lying,

26:05.814 --> 26:07.645
she knows where my dad is.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.431
I'm sure he's fine, sweetie.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.517
Nothing to worry about.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.027
But tell you what...

26:14.114 --> 26:17.481
I'll make a couple of
calls, see what I can do.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.070
Come on.

26:22.039 --> 26:25.247
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.844
Linden.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.800
Yeah.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.229
That's it?

26:48.941 --> 26:52.479
All right, just put a copy
of his statement on my desk.

26:53.779 --> 26:57.692
Deschler lawyered up and provided an
alibi for the night of the murders.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.149
He's got time-stamped photos
he took of the Stansbury house

27:00.244 --> 27:02.326
right up until he dialed 911.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.540
Guess he was looking for
Phoebe in her window, and then

27:05.582 --> 27:08.665
called it in when he realized
the flashes of light were gunfire.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.244
Maybe those photos are
something we can go on.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.629
No. They said there's a
couple muzzle flashes visible,

27:14.675 --> 27:17.417
but otherwise the house was
too dark to see anything.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.464
The kid's still our best suspect.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.805
He could be playing us.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.511
I'm just saying.

27:29.273 --> 27:32.106
Convenient that he didn't tell
us about his fucked-up family.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.400
No one talks about family
secrets and you know it.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.273
They just stay screwed up.

27:37.948 --> 27:39.779
Not everyone messes up their kids.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.316
You know, it's a choice how you act.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.368
A uni said Emmett had a couple
of years' worth of photos.

27:52.462 --> 27:55.295
Let's go through them and see
if there's anything we can pull.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.585
Have to do it manana.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.965
They'll still be dead tomorrow, Linden.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.595
What's the matter?

28:09.646 --> 28:12.058
You afraid to be alone or something?

30:01.717 --> 30:03.332
We got a problem.

30:03.427 --> 30:06.385
You know how I love breasts and thighs.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.257
Just pick whichever one is smallest.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.963
They're both way more than enough.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.969
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.104
They need some dietary restrictions.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.810
My sis and her kid, they only eat
foods that got the word "fried",

30:23.947 --> 30:27.485
"finger," "strip" or "stick" in it.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.987
Need some probiotics to clean them out.

30:30.078 --> 30:33.036
Staying up late, watching
the Oxygen Network again?

30:33.123 --> 30:34.829
Yes.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.828
The baby needs some building blocks.

30:37.961 --> 30:42.125
From now on, it's just
raw milk, fresh greens.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.001
You're gonna start craving
things that are white.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.878
Mm. Like you?

30:45.969 --> 30:47.379
Hell, yeah.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.757
Better fucking believe it.

30:50.766 --> 30:56.227
No, but seriously, like potatoes,
cottage cheese, tapioca, cocktail onions.

30:56.313 --> 31:00.431
Babe, why don't you get some
of the Cap'n Crunch you like?

31:00.525 --> 31:02.311
No.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.563
No. I'm only eating what you're eating.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.519
I'm pregnant too.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.780
Okay, you're really cute.

31:10.744 --> 31:13.736
But it's still super early and
I know you love your cereal.

31:14.164 --> 31:17.201
Well, he is the captain and
everything. You know, he can pull rank.

31:17.292 --> 31:22.628
So he knows crunch berries
make me a better crime fighter.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.655
Help me.

32:41.168 --> 32:43.159
Help me.

32:49.217 --> 32:52.209
Kyle, help me.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.840
Please.

32:55.056 --> 32:57.468
Kyle.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.440
Help me.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.315
Nadine?

33:16.620 --> 33:19.737
Please, help me.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.967
Kyle.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.971
Nadine?

33:43.730 --> 33:45.846
- Kyle.
- Nadine.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.359
Kyle, please, help me.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.105
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.231
Oh, man.

33:55.575 --> 33:58.157
Oh, Kyle.

33:58.495 --> 34:01.703
I'm sorry.
We're just having a little fun.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.076
You understand, right?

34:04.167 --> 34:05.703
Hey.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.583
How's your dead sister, by the way?

34:09.631 --> 34:11.792
- What are you doing?
- Whoa.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.420
We're just messing around, AJ.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.006
- Why don't you chill the fuck out?
- Don't move.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.510
Apologize to Cadet Stansbury.

34:22.018 --> 34:27.854
Why don't you get the
fuck out of my face, sir?

34:29.317 --> 34:30.773
- Wait, no!
- Strike him, cadet.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.566
- What the fuck...?
- Strike him, now.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.645
- Get the fuck off me!
- Hit him, goddammit!

34:34.739 --> 34:37.025
- Hit him, that's an order!
- Get the fuck off me!

34:37.117 --> 34:38.323
Again!

34:38.994 --> 34:40.074
- Again!
- Run!

34:40.620 --> 34:43.453
Again! Again!

34:43.540 --> 34:45.280
Let him go! He's had enough!

34:45.959 --> 34:49.292
That's enough, that's enough.
Easy, easy.

34:49.379 --> 34:51.165
Easy.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.783
Your gun.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.990
You didn't think we'd
forget, did you, Sarah?

35:25.081 --> 35:29.245
Your request for a new sidearm.
After your last one was stolen.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.671
Try and be more careful next
time, will you, Detective?

35:35.675 --> 35:37.540
- Yeah, thanks.
- Thanks.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.354
Hot off the press.

35:49.439 --> 35:50.975
Lab pulled a print from my bag.

35:51.024 --> 35:54.357
Our mystery lady is one Katrina Nelson.

35:58.031 --> 35:59.771
She was at the hospital.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.815
Not the only place she was at.

36:02.494 --> 36:06.032
Got latents not only in the beach
house but all over the main house.

36:06.122 --> 36:10.456
Living room, dining room,
kitchen, master bed, master bath.

36:10.543 --> 36:12.329
She got around.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.583
Unis are following up on
her last known address,

36:16.257 --> 36:18.748
but the landlady said
she took off last October.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.129
Getting ESD to check in
on her last employment,

36:21.221 --> 36:22.586
but so far, it's nothing.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.721
She's got priors last three years.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.555
Petty theft, robbery, vandalism.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.683
Keep reading. It gets better.

36:29.479 --> 36:33.063
Aggravated assault charges filed
against her on October 9th of last year.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.848
"DA dropped charges shortly thereafter

36:34.984 --> 36:39.227
citing lack of cooperation from
the victim, Philip Stansbury."

36:41.199 --> 36:42.405
She assaulted him,

36:42.492 --> 36:44.949
and he let her off scot-free.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.030
Wonder why.

37:10.437 --> 37:12.268
Keep icing it.

37:14.441 --> 37:18.309
If anybody asks, you got cracked
by your rifle during drills.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.109
Why are you being cool to me now?

37:20.155 --> 37:22.191
You never were before.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.195
Because that psycho Lincoln deserves it.

37:27.954 --> 37:29.910
I thought you lost all
your memory, cadet.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.200
No. Just from that night.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.161
You were a pussy before.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.622
Maybe you're growing a pair now.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.674
Ten-hut.

38:00.361 --> 38:07.233
At assembly, I said that
certain practices would cease.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.949
Was I unclear, cadet?

38:16.961 --> 38:18.792
N0, ma'am.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.469
What happened to your face, cadet?

38:28.556 --> 38:30.672
I fell in the shower, ma'am.

38:33.394 --> 38:36.101
You need to be more
careful next time, cadet.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.559
Yes, ma'am.

38:40.610 --> 38:43.397
In any battalion, you are one.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.692
You all have the same strengths.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.281
You all have the same weaknesses.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.992
What happens to one of
you happens to all of you.

38:52.038 --> 38:58.159
One of you disobeys my orders,
all of you disobey my orders.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.848
You didn't have those bruises on
your hand yesterday morning, cadet.

39:19.232 --> 39:22.565
I lost control of my
rifle during drills, ma'am.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.279
I gave you your chance.

39:28.741 --> 39:31.483
And you've chosen to make
an example of yourself.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.735
And of everyone else.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.083
Cadet Fielding, have your
battalion assembled in full ACUs

39:40.128 --> 39:42.585
on the north field at 0700.

39:42.589 --> 39:44.329
Yes, ma'am.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.841
You heard the colonel, let's go!

39:54.601 --> 39:56.341
Right wheel!

39:56.519 --> 39:58.475
Right wheel!

39:58.688 --> 40:00.770
Tighten the formation!

40:02.525 --> 40:05.016
Battalion, halt!

40:08.114 --> 40:10.070
Rifles down!

40:10.366 --> 40:12.357
What the hell is that, cadets?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.196
You call that a formation?

40:14.287 --> 40:17.575
That was an embarrassment. Get
it together, you pieces of shit.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.412
We're gonna do it until we get it right.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.753
Adopt the push-up position.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.838
Now!

40:28.301 --> 40:29.711
Down!

40:29.761 --> 40:31.342
Half way!

40:31.387 --> 40:34.220
Down! Up!

40:34.515 --> 40:36.380
Half way!

40:36.434 --> 40:38.049
Up!

40:38.686 --> 40:40.142
Down!

40:40.146 --> 40:41.511
What is your problem?

40:41.564 --> 40:43.600
You have a problem with me, cadet?

40:43.650 --> 40:46.813
Get down! Up!

40:48.071 --> 40:49.561
Half way!

40:49.614 --> 40:51.070
Down!

40:51.074 --> 40:54.237
Up! Half way!

40:54.827 --> 40:56.408
Down!

40:56.996 --> 40:58.702
Up!

40:58.790 --> 41:00.405
Down!

41:18.393 --> 41:20.554
Got something for me, homes?

41:20.645 --> 41:22.385
I don't gotta talk to you, pig.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.429
You do now. Probable cause.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.310
Decriminalized, bitch.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.312
No, not that.

41:29.445 --> 41:30.821
- That.
- What?

41:32.615 --> 41:34.776
This, dumbass.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.236
You got papers for this?

41:36.327 --> 41:38.909
Yo, what you hassling me for, man?

41:40.665 --> 41:41.996
You Logic?

41:42.083 --> 41:43.698
No, that ain't me.

41:43.793 --> 41:45.624
I heard that dude won the mega millions.

41:45.712 --> 41:47.293
Moved to Minneapolis or something.

41:47.296 --> 41:52.416
Asshole. You're on the
SPD payroll as a CI, right?

41:52.468 --> 41:55.301
Keep it down, all right? Jesus.

41:55.555 --> 42:00.675
You talk to some cops, male-female duo,
a couple weeks ago about a missing kid?

42:01.019 --> 42:03.351
No, I ain't snitched to
5-0 in, like, forever.

42:03.396 --> 42:05.728
That's a long time, be specific.

42:06.441 --> 42:09.183
I don't know, maybe four,
five months at least.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.483
You didn't talk to anybody?

42:10.570 --> 42:12.356
Lady cop.

42:12.780 --> 42:13.815
Redhead.

42:15.908 --> 42:18.945
Sure you weren't just tweaked
out of your mind and forgot?

42:19.203 --> 42:21.694
No, I quit that poison way back when.

42:22.832 --> 42:25.494
This? I need this for my
pain management.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.784
- No shit.
- Shit.

42:28.963 --> 42:31.625
This is like Flintstones chewables.

42:34.719 --> 42:38.007
I'm only keeping this. You're welcome.

42:42.101 --> 42:43.602
Yo.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.519
You guys still handing
out scratch to snitches?

42:48.232 --> 42:49.768
Possible.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.065
Gotta get me something good.

43:09.337 --> 43:10.918
Kyle.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.338
In case you don't remember,
stay away from the beans.

43:21.390 --> 43:23.802
They'll give you the runs.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.810
You did real good today.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.561
I'm proud of you.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.566
Really? I thought, I don't know,

43:33.569 --> 43:36.231
I kind of thought I messed
up. Everybody's pissed at me.

43:36.239 --> 43:39.197
You showed loyalty to the
unit, that's all that matters.

43:39.242 --> 43:42.279
Colonel Rayne would have punished
us way more if you'd ratted.

43:44.038 --> 43:45.824
Thanks, sir.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.951
You can call me by my name.

43:49.085 --> 43:50.245
Okay.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.372
They have a cop car outside the gates.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.249
Saw it today during drills.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.126
What's up with that?

43:57.927 --> 44:02.421
They think whoever did that to my
family is gonna come back for me.

44:02.431 --> 44:05.594
Some doughnut-eating cop
isn't gonna stop anybody.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.216
We will.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.602
No one's hurting one
of our own. Understand?

44:09.689 --> 44:12.055
Yes, sir, AJ.

44:16.571 --> 44:19.187
Close ranks, boys, we got
some unfriendlies approaching.

44:25.079 --> 44:26.410
Kyle, we need to talk to you.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.613
- I'm eating dinner.
- It can't wait.

44:28.958 --> 44:31.074
I already told you everything
I know. Get off my back.

44:31.085 --> 44:34.373
Ma'am, regulations state you're not
permitted in here without an escort.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.162
Slow your roll there, Captain America.

44:36.215 --> 44:39.457
You don't wanna take any
friendly fire now, do you?

44:41.470 --> 44:43.131
You wanna talk here?

44:45.600 --> 44:47.966
It's fine. You got those photos?

44:48.060 --> 44:50.642
We'll make a whole collage
of Phoebe here on the table.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.224
Is that what you want?

44:52.273 --> 44:54.138
Or we can go talk in the hall.

44:54.192 --> 44:56.057
It's your call, Kyle.

45:01.115 --> 45:02.571
You know this girl?

45:04.118 --> 45:06.359
- You sure? Take another look.
- I don't know who that is.

45:06.412 --> 45:10.451
I insist you follow regulations or
I'll be obligated to call security.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.582
Ten-hut.

45:15.087 --> 45:17.373
That'll be enough, Cadet Fielding.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.791
- What are you doing here?
- You weren't in your office.

45:21.802 --> 45:25.420
I don't have time to conduct my
investigation around your schedule.

45:25.473 --> 45:27.179
That badge may work outside these walls,

45:27.225 --> 45:29.090
but in here, we have a
different set of rules.

45:29.101 --> 45:30.807
That's clear.

45:31.354 --> 45:33.436
I know women like you.

45:33.481 --> 45:36.689
You think by defying authority,
you can get the respect you crave

45:36.692 --> 45:38.068
from your male colleagues.

45:38.069 --> 45:41.937
That's not the way it works,
Detective. Not in here, and not with me.

45:41.989 --> 45:44.480
You don't know anything about me.

45:44.784 --> 45:46.149
And I'm not defying your authority.

45:46.244 --> 45:47.950
- I'm doing my job.
- So am I.

45:48.329 --> 45:51.787
I have already repeated myself once,
which is once more than I ever do.

45:51.832 --> 45:53.493
You come here again,

45:53.542 --> 45:55.954
and you talk with any of my
students without my permission,

45:55.962 --> 46:00.626
and I will go to the deputy commissioner
and file a formal complaint.

46:01.467 --> 46:04.083
All right, let's go, Linden. Come on.

46:05.888 --> 46:07.298
Let's go.

46:18.693 --> 46:20.433
As you were.

46:32.748 --> 46:34.739
Kid's lying.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.412
He knows something.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.994
He probably knows Kat.
They could've done it together.

46:40.047 --> 46:41.958
Don't ever do that again.

46:43.092 --> 46:45.424
I was helping you out, Linden.

46:45.678 --> 46:48.511
You can't always be going at 11.

46:48.889 --> 46:51.596
Now we got her right where we want her.

46:52.268 --> 46:54.384
It's like with lions.

46:54.395 --> 46:58.058
Now, when you tame them, you
gotta put them on a pedestal.

46:58.649 --> 47:02.767
Let them think they're dominant,
that they got the upper hand.

47:02.778 --> 47:07.772
Now, they feel safe up there,
feared, like, the alpha dog.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.991
You make them believe that
they're looking down on you,

47:11.037 --> 47:12.652
when all eyes are actually on them,

47:12.663 --> 47:15.496
and you're the one
who's really in control.

47:16.083 --> 47:19.075
Trust me, Linden. It went good.

47:28.804 --> 47:31.136
Stop worrying about Bethany.

47:56.916 --> 47:58.122
Linden.

48:00.961 --> 48:03.247
Have you talked to Skinner lately?

48:03.923 --> 48:05.163
No. Why?

48:06.842 --> 48:08.503
His daughter's worried.

48:08.511 --> 48:10.547
She thinks something happened to him.

48:11.764 --> 48:15.052
She's real broke up
over Daddy going AWOL.

48:15.684 --> 48:17.220
Figured I'd ask you.

48:17.269 --> 48:18.884
Yeah, I don't know.

48:18.938 --> 48:20.974
You know how kids can be though.

48:21.023 --> 48:23.355
I do, I do. I have a daughter of my own.

48:23.401 --> 48:26.108
But I wanted to help Bethany out, so I

48:27.196 --> 48:29.938
I checked Skinner's phone records.

48:30.825 --> 48:34.409
He hasn't made a call since
that night Adrian went missing.

48:36.372 --> 48:38.363
His last call was to you.

48:39.917 --> 48:42.374
Thought your phone was dead that night.

48:46.048 --> 48:49.006
You said you and Skinner were
shaking down CIs near Adrian's school.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.882
I checked around.

48:51.220 --> 48:55.964
Funny thing, nobody
remembers speaking with you.

49:04.400 --> 49:07.016
We were having an affair.

49:07.862 --> 49:13.448
I ended his marriage, wrecked his
family, he moved out on his child.

49:14.577 --> 49:18.161
You wanna know more than
that, then talk to him.

49:20.875 --> 49:25.414
Otherwise stay the fuck out of my face.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.452
I needed to see you.

49:57.495 --> 50:00.328
I tried at the hospital,
but there were cops around.

50:08.797 --> 50:11.504
No, don't.

50:18.307 --> 50:20.548
Do you remember what happened?

50:23.521 --> 50:26.228
The last thing I remember
I was here in my room.

50:26.273 --> 50:28.730
Then I was in the hospital.

50:33.572 --> 50:36.439
Oh, okay.

50:36.992 --> 50:38.732
You're okay.

50:38.744 --> 50:40.985
That's all that matters.

50:41.997 --> 50:44.830
The police came asking about you.

50:46.335 --> 50:48.917
I didn't tell them anything.

51:03.852 --> 51:06.389
They got what they deserved.
