***

00:01.522 --> 00:03.178
***

00:03.178 --> 00:04.778
Do us a favor.

00:05.131 --> 00:07.247
Don't try this at home! Whoa!

00:08.610 --> 00:10.911
On this episode of "
Mythbusters"...

00:10.911 --> 00:14.800
The fans take command in "
Mythssion control."

00:15.909 --> 00:19.169
First up, it's the
Hyneman versus Newton

00:19.679 --> 00:23.747
As Adam and Jamie cause a
cacophony of car carnage...

00:23.747 --> 00:26.481
One car into one wall
at 50 miles an hour.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.638
100-miles-per-hour crash.

00:28.739 --> 00:30.838
Bring on the head-on collision!

00:30.839 --> 00:35.425
...Testing Jamie's notion on
Newton's third law of motion.

00:35.426 --> 00:38.054
So are you ready for some
more wanton destruction?

00:38.055 --> 00:39.873
Meanwhile... Aah!

00:39.874 --> 00:41.016
...Kari, Grant, and Tory

00:41.017 --> 00:43.369
Are back in the
school of hard knocks

00:43.370 --> 00:46.686
As they retest "
Knock your socks off."

00:49.354 --> 00:50.979
hold on to your socks, Buster!

00:50.979 --> 00:55.175
And this time, they're
cruising for maximum bruising.

00:59.231 --> 01:01.104
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:01.728 --> 01:03.917
Adam savage... That is science.

01:03.917 --> 01:05.259
...And Jamie Hyneman.

01:05.259 --> 01:06.418
We're gonna have an adventure.

01:06.798 --> 01:07.748
Between them,

01:07.748 --> 01:11.080
more than 30 years of
special-effect experience.

01:11.081 --> 01:12.486
Fun for the whole family.

01:13.568 --> 01:15.258
Joining them...

01:15.258 --> 01:16.730
Grant imahara...

01:16.731 --> 01:17.939
Formidable projectile.

01:17.940 --> 01:18.945
...Kari Byron...

01:18.946 --> 01:20.117
let's do it.

01:20.118 --> 01:21.522
...And Tory Belleci.

01:21.523 --> 01:22.898
it's alive!

01:22.899 --> 01:24.929
They don't just tell the myths.

01:24.929 --> 01:27.953
They put them to the test.

01:39.757 --> 01:40.894
So, what's up?

01:40.895 --> 01:43.436
"What's up" Is that the
fans are in control.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.382
It is effectively "
Mythssion control."

01:46.383 --> 01:47.695
So how does that work?

01:47.695 --> 01:49.933
Cast your mind back to "
Compact compact."

01:49.933 --> 01:51.623
Remember we smashed two semis

01:51.623 --> 01:53.312
Into each other at
50 miles per hour,

01:53.313 --> 01:55.736
Which you said on
camera was equivalent

01:55.736 --> 01:58.601
To one of them hitting a
wall at 100 miles an hour.

01:58.601 --> 02:01.915
And the fans went nuts.
They are revolting.

02:01.916 --> 02:03.820
They rose up, and they said, "No!"

02:03.821 --> 02:05.526
2 cars hitting each other
at 50 miles an hour

02:05.527 --> 02:07.505
Is not equivalent to one hitting
a wall at 100 miles an hour.

02:07.505 --> 02:10.937
It is equivalent to one hitting
a wall at 50 miles an hour.

02:10.939 --> 02:12.507
They say that you were wrong.

02:13.274 --> 02:14.328
Let's test it.

02:14.328 --> 02:15.782
That's what I thought.

02:15.783 --> 02:19.094
It was the episode that
had it all -- crashes...

02:20.934 --> 02:23.373
Wow!Smashes...

02:23.821 --> 02:25.604
...And according to the fans,

02:25.604 --> 02:28.028
A subtle physics faux pas.

02:28.028 --> 02:30.867
Both trucks were traveling
at about 50 miles an hour

02:30.867 --> 02:32.236
When the impact occurred.

02:32.237 --> 02:34.978
Now, that's equivalent
to a single impact

02:34.979 --> 02:38.386
Going into a solid wall
at 100 miles an hour.

02:38.387 --> 02:40.559
Uh, stop right there.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.398
This innocent remark...

02:42.399 --> 02:45.173
Now, that's equivalent
to a single impact

02:45.174 --> 02:48.615
Going into a solid wall
at 100 miles an hour.

02:49.073 --> 02:52.125
...Sparked a fan frenzy.

02:52.126 --> 02:54.900
They reckon that because
of Newton's third law --

02:54.901 --> 02:57.706
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction --

02:57.707 --> 03:00.883
2 Ats Thar ccrashing
at 50 miles per hour

03:00.884 --> 03:04.091
Is the same as one car
crashing into a wall

03:04.092 --> 03:08.904
At just 50 miles per
hour and not 100.

03:08.905 --> 03:13.114
But can this counterintuitive
argument really be right?

03:14.718 --> 03:17.792
Well, the fans are in control.
How do they want us to do it?

03:17.793 --> 03:19.211
Obviously they want us to smash

03:19.211 --> 03:20.852
Some full-size cars
into each other.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.110
But I think we may
be able to illuminate

03:23.110 --> 03:25.975
Somef the physics here
with a scale experiment.

03:25.975 --> 03:27.543
Under more controlled
circumstances.

03:27.544 --> 03:28.981
Exactly!

03:28.982 --> 03:31.020
And then we get to smash
some full-size cars.

03:31.021 --> 03:32.825
Yes, we do!

03:33.852 --> 03:36.145
But first up,
Adam is rigging a rig

03:36.145 --> 03:39.050
That will replicate the
crash in miniature.

03:39.454 --> 03:40.574
The part of the car

03:40.574 --> 03:43.378
Will be played by two
weights on a pendulum.

03:44.023 --> 03:45.424
It's gonna be loud.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.759
And the wall...

03:46.760 --> 03:49.766
Bring in the immovable object!

03:49.767 --> 03:51.938
Bring in the immovable object!

03:51.939 --> 03:54.510
It's time for the
immovable object.

03:54.511 --> 03:56.726
...Will be played by
this hunk of steel.

03:57.255 --> 03:58.462
Allow me to demonstrate
the rig here.

03:58.462 --> 04:01.573
This is our "Car.
" It's basically a swinging hammer.

04:01.573 --> 04:03.142
This is our "Wall."

04:03.143 --> 04:07.215
It's an unmovable piece of 1,
200 pounds of steel.

04:07.216 --> 04:09.916
I will be swinging this
"Car" Into the "Wall"

04:09.917 --> 04:12.518
At speed "X" And speed 2x,

04:12.519 --> 04:14.686
Which is basically
double speed "X."

04:14.687 --> 04:16.454
That's our 50-mile-per-hour hit.

04:16.454 --> 04:18.454
That's our 100-mile-per-hour hit.

04:18.456 --> 04:22.058
Our measurement will be done
simply with a piece of Clay

04:22.059 --> 04:23.992
That sits right
behind the main hammer

04:23.993 --> 04:26.993
And between it and
a secondary hammer.

04:26.994 --> 04:29.449
Obviously, when I swing
this car into the wall,

04:29.449 --> 04:30.639
That Clay will compress,

04:30.639 --> 04:32.901
And it will likely
compress a different amount

04:32.901 --> 04:35.418
At speed "X" Than at speed 2x,

04:35.418 --> 04:38.321
And this gives me a
beautiful comparison point

04:38.322 --> 04:41.579
When I smack two cars into
each other a little bit later.

04:42.154 --> 04:44.216
Okay, so the swing from 1x

04:44.216 --> 04:47.070
Wi ll imita 50pea
e-ilr-hour wall crash,

04:47.070 --> 04:49.791
And the 2x swing
will double the speed

04:49.791 --> 04:53.758
Ca rli cep a itesha
rao 1esat h mer

04:55.374 --> 04:57.628
R g cainlltt waa at speed 1x

04:57.628 --> 05:00.909
in 3, 2, 1.

05:02.925 --> 05:05.193
satisfying ding, isn't it? Yeah.

05:05.194 --> 05:06.661
Tisfying, maybe.

05:06.662 --> 05:10.798
But more importantly...
Their first data point.

05:10.799 --> 05:15.569
Post compression length... 1.5.

05:16.328 --> 05:17.972
For a comprehensive result,

05:17.972 --> 05:19.939
The guys get into
the swing of things

05:19.940 --> 05:22.817
And repeat the test
five more times.

05:24.430 --> 05:28.733
Next, it'sime to double the
speed to 2for a full sng.

05:28.734 --> 05:32.101
Uncompressed length, 2.6.

05:32.102 --> 05:34.695
Car hitting a wall at speed 2x

05:34.695 --> 05:37.374
in 3, 2, 1.

05:41.868 --> 05:42.868
I think that's more.

05:42.869 --> 05:44.469
I think that's a lot more.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.671
Yep, and the measurements
hammer that home.

05:47.672 --> 05:49.739
.777.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.507
It's a little bit less
than twice as compressed

05:52.508 --> 05:54.242
As the speed-1x hit.

05:54.243 --> 05:56.610
-That makes sense, doesn't it?
- Does.

05:56.611 --> 05:58.596
Almost double the compression.

05:58.596 --> 06:00.740
But for a larger sample size,

06:00.740 --> 06:05.343
They swing into action and
repeat the 2x test five times.

06:07.293 --> 06:10.255
And now that their cla
collection is complete...

06:10.255 --> 06:11.217
What's next?

06:11.217 --> 06:13.885
Well, we've got our metric
of speed "X" And speed 2x.

06:13.885 --> 06:15.917
Now it's time to smack
two cars into each otr.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.558
So we're gonna remove the wall

06:18.558 --> 06:20.782
And bring in a second car.

06:20.782 --> 06:24.102
Physicists and fs, stand by...

06:24.102 --> 06:26.063
They're identical. Let's do it.

06:26.063 --> 06:28.531
...Because this is
the moment of trh.

06:28.532 --> 06:31.834
W, that's equivalent
to a single impact

06:31.835 --> 06:34.937
Going into a sol wall
at 100 miles an hour.

06:34.938 --> 06:37.739
Will the Clay clear
up thcontrovey,

06:37.740 --> 06:40.375
Or wl it be as clear as mud?

06:49.917 --> 06:53.104
Okay, "Mythssi control.
" What do the fans havfor us?

06:54.234 --> 06:55.506
Guess.

06:55.506 --> 06:57.540
-"Knock your socks off."
-Yep.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.507
Man, we totly busted that one.

06:59.508 --> 07:01.241
Apparently not.
According to the fans...

07:01.726 --> 07:04.027
you can knock someone's socks off

07:04.028 --> 07:06.036
If you have a hard enough punch.

07:06.036 --> 07:08.537
so apparently we messed it up.

07:08.538 --> 07:10.105
Really? What did they
say we got wrong?

07:10.106 --> 07:11.406
Take your pick.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.179
You used the wrong punch.

07:14.179 --> 07:16.235
Your socks had to
much elastic in it.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.536
Buster was not supporting
his own weight.

07:18.537 --> 07:20.437
Well, looks like we got
to pull our socks up

07:20.438 --> 07:21.638
And give this one another go.

07:21.639 --> 07:22.638
Cool.

07:22.639 --> 07:24.005
cool.

07:24.006 --> 07:25.940
cool.

07:25.941 --> 07:28.208
The last time the
team test the myth

07:28.209 --> 07:31.147
That one punch could lift
Buster out of his leg wear...

07:31.147 --> 07:34.267
500 p.S.I. Was really intense!

07:34.267 --> 07:37.369
...Nothing they tried
could knock his socks off.

07:37.369 --> 07:40.046
And the myth was
down for the count.

07:40.046 --> 07:42.614
Or was it? Well, apparently not.

07:42.615 --> 07:44.684
The fanslooded our in-box,

07:44.685 --> 07:47.387
Telling us exactly
what we got wrong.

07:47.388 --> 07:50.423
Now armed with a list
of mythical mistakes,

07:50.424 --> 07:53.191
The team is ready for a rematch.

07:53.192 --> 07:55.761
so, geven re huns fanpoese,
where do we start?

07:55.762 --> 07:57.596
Well, the most prevalent criticism

07:57.597 --> 07:59.397
Is that we used the wrong sock.

07:59.397 --> 08:02.233
We used elasticized,
long sport socks,

08:02.234 --> 08:04.469
The "Worst-case scenario"
For the experiment.

08:04.470 --> 08:06.471
Meaning they were too
difficult to pull off.

08:06.472 --> 08:07.571
Exactly.

08:07.572 --> 08:08.831
All right, well,
why don't we start out

08:08.831 --> 08:10.607
With the best-case-scenario sock,

08:10.608 --> 08:12.975
The one that requires the least
amount of effort to pull off?

08:12.976 --> 08:14.377
Once we find that,

08:14.378 --> 08:16.546
Then we can unleash some
heavyweight punches on it.

08:16.547 --> 08:19.055
All right, well, since we need
to be meticulous about this,

08:19.055 --> 08:22.239
We should also test hairy
leg versus hairless leg,

08:22.239 --> 08:25.272
So that way we get the
best leg/sock combination.

08:25.273 --> 08:27.292
Are you volunteering
your bare legs?

08:27.292 --> 08:29.076
I don't wax my legs.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.366
Not yet you don't.

08:30.367 --> 08:31.434
Ooh, hey!

08:31.435 --> 08:33.169
round 1.

08:33.169 --> 08:34.669
Right.

08:34.671 --> 08:36.631
First into the ring is the sock,

08:36.631 --> 08:38.822
And to measure just how much force

08:38.822 --> 08:41.618
It takes to pull a sock
off a human foot...

08:41.618 --> 08:45.787
I hope this is the sock puller
annot the knee dislocator.

08:46.222 --> 08:49.591
...Grant has designed
this sock stripper.

08:49.591 --> 08:51.115
Let me introduce you to the

08:51.115 --> 08:53.726
dual Sock-pulling-and-measurement
machine.

08:53.727 --> 08:55.577
Here I have a giant
pneumatic cylinder

08:55.577 --> 08:59.059
Capable of generating over 2,
400 pounds of force,

08:59.059 --> 09:00.202
Which would be equivalent to, say,

09:00.202 --> 09:01.694
hanging a car on your sock

09:01.695 --> 09:03.061
And letting it drop.

09:03.062 --> 09:04.635
Connected to the clevis is a bar

09:04.635 --> 09:06.801
With dual high-precision
force meters.

09:06.801 --> 09:07.967
Now, why two meters?

09:07.968 --> 09:11.386
Because we want to compare
Side-by-side,simultaneously,

09:11.386 --> 09:14.811
the difference between a
hairy leg and a waxed leg.

09:14.811 --> 09:19.046
And, finally, here in the seat
will sit our test subject, Tory.

09:19.047 --> 09:23.081
Unfortunately for Tory,
he is destined for the hot seat,

09:23.081 --> 09:27.522
So Kari is wielding
the spatula of doom.

09:27.522 --> 09:28.446
How's that feel?

09:28.446 --> 09:29.810
It actually feels kind of good.

09:29.810 --> 09:31.846
What's so bad about waxing?

09:31.847 --> 09:33.925
So, ready? 1, 2, 3.

09:40.317 --> 09:42.926
With Tory's legs now
covering both bases --

09:42.926 --> 09:47.716
Smooth and hairy -
it's time to select the sock.

09:47.716 --> 09:49.549
what's with all the socks?

09:49.549 --> 09:51.099
well, for this test,

09:51.099 --> 09:52.966
We are going to leave
no sock untested.

09:52.967 --> 09:56.180
Look at this -- we have
long socks, short socks,

09:56.180 --> 10:00.706
Cotton socks, nylon, wool, silk,

10:00.707 --> 10:05.310
And, finally, genuine
19th-century boxing socks.

10:05.311 --> 10:08.205
We're going to pull all of
these socks off of Tory's feet

10:08.205 --> 10:10.812
And find the socks
of least resistance.

10:10.812 --> 10:13.947
ew. Tory's feet? Disgusting.

10:13.948 --> 10:15.248
shut up.

10:15.249 --> 10:17.167
Yep, the sock stripper is set.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.440
So the team starts at the top.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.508
Okay, this is sock number one --

10:21.509 --> 10:24.244
Cotton, long socks, loose elastic.

10:24.245 --> 10:27.114
3, 2, 1.

10:29.617 --> 10:31.050
Kari notes the numbers,

10:31.051 --> 10:34.623
And then it's just apply,
strip, and repeat.

10:35.555 --> 10:39.357
Good, I need you to
take off my socks.

10:39.358 --> 10:41.904
Long sock, acrylic, nylon.
Push the button.

10:45.657 --> 10:47.501
Didn't even come off my foot.

10:47.501 --> 10:51.500
They both peaked out at 35.38.

10:51.500 --> 10:56.003
Tory gets his socks off
over and over and over

10:56.004 --> 10:59.406
As the team tries socks of
every material and length

10:59.407 --> 11:03.518
To leave no sock untested,
just as you demanded.

11:03.518 --> 11:07.712
These ones are the lovely socks
knit with love from a fan.

11:07.712 --> 11:08.736
All right.

11:10.018 --> 11:11.669
Whoo! Those looked good.

11:11.669 --> 11:14.036
5.64 pounds!

11:14.037 --> 11:17.506
Finally, after testing
over 50 types of socks,

11:17.507 --> 11:19.741
They've got the data they need.

11:20.227 --> 11:21.337
So here's something crazy.

11:21.337 --> 11:22.720
Out of our top four contenders,

11:23.108 --> 11:24.365
two of them were long socks

11:24.365 --> 11:25.858
Anofd o mtw the were short socks.

11:25.858 --> 11:28.759
So it's looking rikeab f
tisc mue ch morisimportant t.

11:28.760 --> 11:29.860
Who would have thunk?

11:29.861 --> 11:32.763
Now, what we also found
was that leg hair

11:32.764 --> 11:35.677
Was a fairly big factor
In making it harder

11:35.677 --> 11:36.723
to pull the sock off.

11:36.723 --> 11:40.669
In most cases, the smoother
leg had less resistance.

11:40.670 --> 11:42.188
But, most importantly,

11:42.188 --> 11:45.706
the wool knit sock Is the
sock of least resistance,

11:45.707 --> 11:48.952
Requiring only 5.6 pounds of force

11:48.952 --> 11:51.109
to rip it om a bare leg.

11:51.110 --> 11:54.446
So the combination of variables
that makes for the best sock

11:54.447 --> 11:58.326
Are smooth leg and nonelastic,

11:58.326 --> 12:00.085
woven, woolen sock.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.187
That's gonna be your best sock

12:02.188 --> 12:04.189
For trying to knock
your socks off.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.523
Coming up next...

12:05.524 --> 12:07.058
This is the moment of truth.

12:07.467 --> 12:09.027
...Were the fans right?

12:16.503 --> 12:18.047
In "Compact compact,"

12:18.047 --> 12:21.315
The fans detected a
disturbance in the force.

12:21.848 --> 12:23.850
the air bag went off!

12:24.348 --> 12:28.351
So now it's Mythbusters
versus sir Isaac Newton.

12:28.352 --> 12:30.619
But for whom does the bell toll?

12:32.555 --> 12:35.268
These two pieces of
Clay tell the tale.

12:35.268 --> 12:37.569
This is the Clay
compressed at speed 1x.

12:37.570 --> 12:39.970
This is the Clay
compressed at speed 2x.

12:39.971 --> 12:40.958
Now, if Jamie's right

12:40.959 --> 12:43.073
that two cars hitting
each other at speed "X"

12:43.074 --> 12:45.575
Is equivalent to one car
hitting a wall at speed 2x,

12:45.576 --> 12:47.716
Then this is what the
Clay is gonna look like

12:47.716 --> 12:50.613
When we smash two cars into
each other at speed "X."

12:50.613 --> 12:51.914
If the myth is true,

12:51.915 --> 12:54.682
This is what the Clay in those
cars is gonna look like.

12:54.683 --> 12:57.697
Which is it? I quite
honestly have no idea.

12:57.697 --> 13:01.001
This is the moment of truth.
Are you ready to go?

13:01.371 --> 13:03.138
What are you doing back there?

13:03.138 --> 13:03.949
I'm ready.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.882
I'm gonna cut from top dead center

13:05.883 --> 13:08.484
So that the amount of
force on both is the same.

13:08.485 --> 13:10.319
Okay. Here we go.

13:10.320 --> 13:14.180
Two cars smashing into
each other at speed 1x

13:14.559 --> 13:17.072
in 3, 2, 1.

13:18.592 --> 13:21.828
The Clay catastrophe
goes under the hammer.

13:21.829 --> 13:24.497
And judging by first impressions,

13:24.960 --> 13:28.001
It looks like the fans
may be on to something.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.400
Well, I'll tell you right now,

13:29.400 --> 13:30.797
The compression I
can see from here

13:30.797 --> 13:33.860
Does not look like
no 2x-speed hit.

13:34.405 --> 13:36.129
It looks like a 1x-speed hit.

13:36.129 --> 13:37.868
It looks a lot closer
to a 1x than a 2x,

13:37.868 --> 13:39.435
But let's do the measurements.

13:39.436 --> 13:42.605
1.54.

13:42.606 --> 13:45.508
1.28.

13:45.997 --> 13:47.138
The results are in.

13:47.138 --> 13:50.307
The two-car test Clay
is almost identical

13:50.308 --> 13:52.643
To the Clay from the 1x tests

13:52.644 --> 13:55.305
And nothing like the 2x tests.

13:55.305 --> 13:57.014
With all the variants
in all of our tests,

13:57.015 --> 13:58.882
One thing was really consistent,

13:58.883 --> 14:02.018
Was that the 2x-speed hits
looked a lot like this,

14:02.019 --> 14:04.465
And the 1x-speed hits
look a lot like this.

14:04.465 --> 14:07.290
In our head-on collision,
it looks like this.

14:11.228 --> 14:12.581
So, where are we with the story?

14:12.581 --> 14:14.640
Well, the hammers and
Clay seem to be saying

14:14.640 --> 14:16.375
That it's looking pretty
good for the myth,

14:16.376 --> 14:19.038
That 2 cars hitting each
other at 50 miles an hour

14:19.038 --> 14:20.796
Might actually be
equivalent To one car

14:20.796 --> 14:22.114
hitting a wall at 50 miles an hour

14:22.115 --> 14:25.421
And not at 100,
as you previously stated.

14:25.421 --> 14:26.809
What do you want to do next?

14:26.809 --> 14:30.487
Next, I want to smash some cars.

14:30.487 --> 14:32.351
All right, then.

14:32.483 --> 14:36.581
Yep, although the impressionable
Clay Supports the fan theory,

14:36.581 --> 14:37.850
will that be true

14:37.850 --> 14:40.319
when they test the mettle
of actual automobiles...

14:40.319 --> 14:41.355
Here we are.

14:41.355 --> 14:42.985
...At a very special location?

14:44.380 --> 14:49.288
It's a platform 120 feet
tall just for dropping stuff!

14:49.289 --> 14:53.192
Thiss a motorized steel barrel
just for strapping down a car

14:53.193 --> 14:55.260
And turning it upside down!

14:56.269 --> 14:58.333
I'm not sure what this one's for,

14:58.333 --> 15:00.088
But I'm pretty sure
I could come up

15:00.088 --> 15:01.908
with something cool To do with it.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.389
Where am I?

15:04.389 --> 15:09.159
I'm in Arizona in the middle
of 150 acres of pure awesome.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.123
This is pretty much what I would
design as my ideal playground.

15:12.123 --> 15:14.891
It's a test facility
designed to break things,

15:14.892 --> 15:19.244
Smash things, make them fail,
and analyze the aftermath.

15:19.244 --> 15:22.759
This is one of the test facilities
Owned by exponent systems,

15:23.048 --> 15:26.149
And today they're gonna
help us smash some cars.

15:28.018 --> 15:32.489
And first up to feel the
crash force is this.

15:32.490 --> 15:33.923
So, this is our car.

15:33.924 --> 15:35.156
This is our car.

15:35.157 --> 15:38.690
We're gonna smash it at 50
miles an hour into a wall.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.322
well, let's get started.

15:41.323 --> 15:42.390
All right.

15:42.391 --> 15:44.358
How's all this gonna go down?

15:44.359 --> 15:47.627
This is a 1,
280-foot-long crash rail.

15:47.628 --> 15:51.163
It has a track embedded
in it and a cable

15:51.164 --> 15:55.167
That pulls the car along that
track towards the impact spot.

15:55.168 --> 15:57.536
These two v8 engines,

15:57.537 --> 16:00.840
Which have about 800
horsepower between them,

16:00.841 --> 16:02.176
Pull this cable,

16:02.176 --> 16:06.044
which pulls the car up
to the desired speed.

16:06.045 --> 16:07.568
When the car gets to about here,

16:07.568 --> 16:08.882
The cable's gonna release it

16:08.882 --> 16:12.050
So it's traveling only
under its own momentum

16:12.051 --> 16:14.586
Right into this big steel thing.

16:14.587 --> 16:17.589
It's at this point that we'll
have a complete picture

16:17.590 --> 16:20.669
Of what happens to a car when
it's going 50 miles an hour

16:20.669 --> 16:24.539
And comes to a dead stop
by crashing into a wall.

16:24.539 --> 16:27.199
It's not just a picture
they'll be getting.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.897
Jamie has also added
some high-tech trickery

16:29.897 --> 16:32.440
To capture the force facts.

16:32.838 --> 16:34.638
There we go.

16:34.639 --> 16:36.671
Inside the car,
underneath the back seat

16:36.671 --> 16:38.783
Is mounted a block
of accelerometers

16:38.783 --> 16:41.445
That measure deceleration
of the impact

16:41.445 --> 16:43.737
In three separate
axes of movement.

16:43.737 --> 16:47.573
That information is sent
back to a data logger

16:47.574 --> 16:49.475
That's mounted in
the back of the car.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.083
It records all that information.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.256
It's kind of like a black box.

16:53.578 --> 16:56.306
This crash, it's
basically a data point,

16:56.306 --> 16:59.633
One of two that we will obtain
In order to correctly analyze

16:59.633 --> 17:00.836
our head-on collision.

17:00.836 --> 17:03.212
Careful viewers will note
that in the full-scale,

17:03.213 --> 17:06.156
We're following the same
experimental procedure As we did

17:06.156 --> 17:07.916
with our hammers and Clay.

17:07.917 --> 17:09.455
We think it has a nice symmetry.

17:09.455 --> 17:11.242
Shall we l the precrash length?

17:11.242 --> 17:13.278
Sure.

17:13.971 --> 17:15.779
15 feet.

17:15.780 --> 17:16.945
All right, then.

17:19.796 --> 17:21.228
All right, the cable's ready.

17:21.228 --> 17:22.172
Come on in.

17:22.536 --> 17:25.470
With the length logged and
the black box engaged,

17:25.471 --> 17:27.743
The car is ready to meet its fate,

17:27.743 --> 17:32.365
Slamming into a solid steel
wall at 50 miles per hour.

17:33.178 --> 17:37.562
All right, this is one car
into one wall at 50 miles ahour

17:37.562 --> 17:39.147
to Take it away.

17:39.148 --> 17:41.450
Okay, Bob,
we're ready for roll-out.

17:41.450 --> 17:45.052
The v8 engines roar as
they spin the cable.

17:45.699 --> 17:47.487
And the car gains speed

17:47.488 --> 17:50.322
Till it's holding at precisely
50 miles per hour...

17:52.000 --> 17:56.802
...And then plows headlong
into a wall of steel.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.281
I hope they're insured.

18:14.784 --> 18:16.727
Yep, it's a car crash, I think.

18:16.727 --> 18:17.560
Yeah.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.227
I'd say what happened here

18:19.228 --> 18:22.862
Was this car here
hit this wall there.

18:23.664 --> 18:26.098
It's a spectacular smash.

18:26.099 --> 18:27.267
The force of the impact

18:27.267 --> 18:29.578
Crunched the front of
the car like a, uh --

18:29.578 --> 18:34.250
Like a car hitting a steel
wall at 50 miles per hour,

18:34.251 --> 18:36.918
Leaving it 3 1/2 feet shorter.

18:36.918 --> 18:38.686
11 feet, 7 inches.

18:38.686 --> 18:41.993
But, of course, that's
not the only impact stat.

18:41.994 --> 18:44.265
What say we find out
what the "G" Load was?

18:44.835 --> 18:48.221
These guys are downloading the
data about the crash right now.

18:50.609 --> 18:52.507
Okay, here's the
stats on that crash.

18:52.507 --> 18:56.923
This car hit that wall at 50.
7 miles per hour

18:56.923 --> 18:59.739
And took an average of 58 g's

18:59.739 --> 19:01.954
in the longitudinal direction.

19:01.954 --> 19:03.300
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say

19:03.300 --> 19:05.956
That when we smash a car into
this wall at 100 miles an hour,

19:05.957 --> 19:09.058
The "G" Load is going to
be significantly higher.

19:09.599 --> 19:11.242
Well, luckily for us,

19:11.242 --> 19:15.483
the only way to confirm
that Is more car carnage.

19:18.484 --> 19:20.085
There was no way I
was gonna do it.

19:20.086 --> 19:21.911
And you did it
without complaining.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.511
If you want to see
what Buster did,

19:23.512 --> 19:27.115
Go to discovery.
Com/mythbusters and check it out.

19:29.283 --> 19:31.835
Could a punch ever be so powerful

19:31.835 --> 19:33.874
It knocks your socks off?

19:33.874 --> 19:37.707
The fans say yes,
as long as it's the right sock

19:37.707 --> 19:40.583
On the right leg
with the right punch.

19:40.584 --> 19:42.914
Oh! Got him in the

19:43.420 --> 19:47.455
The Mythbusters have the sock
of least resistance sewn up.

19:47.456 --> 19:48.619
Those slipped right off.

19:48.619 --> 19:52.241
So next they're finding
Buster some real legs.

19:52.241 --> 19:54.923
The last time we did this experiment,
we used these feet.

19:54.923 --> 19:57.707
Now, you felt like they didn't
have the same kind of resistance

19:57.707 --> 19:58.846
Than human skin would have.

19:58.846 --> 20:01.507
So I've casted up my foot,

20:01.507 --> 20:03.623
And now I'm gonna try
different materials To see

20:03.623 --> 20:06.712
what kind of material is
as close to human skin.

20:06.712 --> 20:09.346
Tory's used plastic,
ballistics medium,

20:09.347 --> 20:11.914
Foam, and lambskin leather

20:11.915 --> 20:15.116
To find something that
simulates a skin-like surface.

20:15.117 --> 20:16.984
Ah! What is that?!

20:17.961 --> 20:20.161
This feels like
somebody uses lotion.

20:20.161 --> 20:22.058
Kari likes the lambskin.

20:22.058 --> 20:24.092
I really think this is
gonna be the winner.

20:24.093 --> 20:26.827
Because it really just
feels the most like skin,

20:26.828 --> 20:29.268
Which is probably
because it is skin.

20:29.268 --> 20:32.132
And after a quick run of tug
tests on the sock puller...

20:32.968 --> 20:35.570
...It turns out her
instincts were flawless.

20:35.571 --> 20:37.772
Yes! 6.25!

20:37.773 --> 20:39.609
This is the most like human skin.

20:40.020 --> 20:43.059
The leather leg,
complete with articulated ankles,

20:43.060 --> 20:46.929
Has an identical sock
resistance to Tory's waxed leg,

20:46.930 --> 20:49.130
Making it perfect for testing.

20:49.559 --> 20:50.910
I've been working on my yoga.

20:50.910 --> 20:52.466
I think I'm getting pretty good.

20:56.859 --> 20:58.627
And now that Buster
has two left feet,

20:58.628 --> 21:01.128
He's cruising for a bruising.

21:01.129 --> 21:03.096
Looks like the bionic man.

21:03.452 --> 21:06.503
The team have a whole
range of punches to throw.

21:06.503 --> 21:09.504
It's like assembling
an old friend.

21:09.505 --> 21:12.856
But first, they're starting
with a familiar enemy --

21:12.856 --> 21:14.474
Nitro punch.

21:14.475 --> 21:16.662
Now, I originally built
this nitrogen cannon

21:16.662 --> 21:19.364
To fire a grappling
hook from a moving car.

21:19.364 --> 21:20.935
The first time we tested it,

21:20.936 --> 21:23.104
It flew off the
table like a rocket.

21:23.105 --> 21:24.817
The second time we tested it,

21:24.817 --> 21:26.707
it punched a hole in the wall.

21:26.708 --> 21:29.976
That is the power of
the nitrogen cannon.

21:30.308 --> 21:32.400
But before nitro is unleashed,

21:32.400 --> 21:35.833
Grant's devising a system
to get the drop on Buster.

21:36.169 --> 21:39.168
So this, my friends,
is the laser trigger.

21:39.168 --> 21:41.138
It's got a beam right
here and a sensor up here.

21:41.139 --> 21:43.140
when I break the beam...

21:43.497 --> 21:46.365
...Fires a solenoid that drops
Buster on his own weight.

21:52.789 --> 21:54.930
Buster's full weight
will be on his feet

21:54.930 --> 21:56.825
Each time he's clobbered.

21:56.826 --> 22:00.861
So seconds out, it's round 1,
the uppercut.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.488
We're about to knock you out.

22:02.901 --> 22:04.661
Last time we pulled
out nitro punch

22:04.661 --> 22:06.766
And gave Buster a
really good uppercut,

22:06.766 --> 22:08.466
We almost knocked his socks off,

22:08.467 --> 22:10.229
And that was with a
tight sports sock.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.597
Now we're using this
woolen hand-knit sock.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.499
I think this might actually work.

22:14.978 --> 22:17.802
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

22:18.139 --> 22:19.939
500 p.S.I. We're good to go.

22:19.940 --> 22:20.588
All right.

22:20.588 --> 22:24.206
Okay, this is uppercut
with proper socks and legs.

22:24.206 --> 22:24.954
all rit.

22:24.954 --> 22:27.557
Fight! All right, here we go.

22:27.558 --> 22:31.493
In 3, 2, 1!

22:32.338 --> 22:33.738
What happened?!

22:33.739 --> 22:36.006
Wow. We knocked him out.

22:36.007 --> 22:37.626
I can't tell if his
socks came off or not.

22:38.013 --> 22:42.813
That punch just landed a massive 6,
000-neeronpp Ucut

22:42.813 --> 22:44.390
Straight to Buster's chin.

22:44.390 --> 22:47.630
That's twice the force
of a heavyweight boxer.

22:47.630 --> 22:50.196
We stone-cold knocked him out,

22:50.197 --> 22:52.566
But his socks are still on.

22:53.238 --> 22:54.705
They're not coming off.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.681
No matter how much
force is hitting him,

22:56.681 --> 22:58.415
The socks are staying on.

22:58.416 --> 23:00.517
Looks like this is not the punch.

23:02.510 --> 23:05.321
Despite all the
fan-inspired changes,

23:05.322 --> 23:07.490
The uppercut didn't cut it.

23:07.491 --> 23:11.026
But there's more
bare-knuckle action to come.

23:11.027 --> 23:13.094
Fight!

23:13.758 --> 23:15.470
Coming up next on "Mythbusters,"

23:15.470 --> 23:18.317
Find out what kind of force it
takes to knock your socks off.

23:25.076 --> 23:28.053
Duking it out in thein g can
be a dangerous business.

23:28.053 --> 23:32.774
But could a prize-fighting punch
knock your socks clean off?

23:33.221 --> 23:35.089
So far, no.

23:35.090 --> 23:37.824
It didn't work before.
It didn't work this time.

23:37.825 --> 23:41.358
But the Mythbusters aren't
throwing in the towel yet.

23:41.359 --> 23:42.530
And that's because the fans think

23:42.530 --> 23:44.294
we have two other kinds
of punches to try --

23:44.295 --> 23:46.495
The right hook and the body blow.

23:46.495 --> 23:48.863
We'll be testing both of
these punches with robots

23:48.864 --> 23:50.292
Because they have
superhuman strength,

23:50.292 --> 23:52.192
And if they can't
knock the socks off,

23:52.193 --> 23:53.760
They'll never get punched off.

23:53.761 --> 23:55.995
But we're gonna start
out by getting hooked.

23:57.564 --> 23:59.898
In the sweet science of bruising,

23:59.899 --> 24:02.314
A right hook packs
a powerful punch.

24:02.314 --> 24:04.259
By pivoting as he swings,

24:04.259 --> 24:08.294
A boxer drives the force of the
blow across his opponent's body.

24:08.294 --> 24:10.910
It's this transverse momentum

24:10.910 --> 24:15.647
That could focus the friction to
force the feet from the socks.

24:16.449 --> 24:20.784
For round 2 of punching,
it's Buster versus the right hook.

24:20.785 --> 24:24.153
So, gentle viewers, to address
your very important concerns,

24:24.154 --> 24:26.911
I've built this
incredible punching robot

24:26.911 --> 24:28.757
That simulates a right hook!

24:29.156 --> 24:31.223
And these are the
hand-knit wool socks

24:31.223 --> 24:32.772
That had the least resistance,

24:32.772 --> 24:35.073
And they are over
our human-like feet.

24:35.529 --> 24:38.130
And this is our quick-release
and laser trigger,

24:38.131 --> 24:40.407
So just before impact,
it'll release Buster

24:40.407 --> 24:43.434
So he's standing on his own weight,
just as you requested.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.602
We're ready to go.

24:50.144 --> 24:51.201
fight!

24:51.201 --> 24:54.503
All right, here we go, in 3, 2, 1!

24:57.873 --> 25:00.078
We knocked him over, but look --

25:00.078 --> 25:02.777
His socks are still on.

25:02.778 --> 25:05.513
One massive right
hook to the head,

25:05.514 --> 25:08.449
And the force is enough
to knock Buster sideways,

25:08.450 --> 25:11.251
But not his socks.

25:11.252 --> 25:14.055
That punch was incredible.
I mean, the power, bang!

25:14.056 --> 25:16.335
And Buster actually
did a somersault.

25:16.335 --> 25:19.983
However, did not
knock his socks off.

25:19.983 --> 25:22.084
Buster has one heck of a chin.

25:22.085 --> 25:25.286
Looks like he wants to
go for another round.

25:25.287 --> 25:26.756
And for the last round,

25:26.756 --> 25:31.179
The team have the most powerful
punch yet -- the body blow.

25:31.927 --> 25:35.129
Now, our body-blow machine is
the most powerful one we have,

25:35.130 --> 25:37.864
And that clocked in at 52,
000 Newtons,

25:37.865 --> 25:40.867
Or 15 times your average boxer.

25:42.064 --> 25:43.777
That massive momentum

25:43.777 --> 25:47.001
Will be delivered right
into Buster's breadbasket.

25:47.194 --> 25:49.862
This is oc sk uryoocks off
straightforward body blow.

25:49.863 --> 25:52.097
We have knit socks, leather legs,

25:52.098 --> 25:54.933
And Buster on his own weight -
180 pounds.

25:55.801 --> 25:56.582
fight!

25:56.582 --> 26:00.868
All right, here we go, in 3, 2, 1!

26:03.421 --> 26:07.656
We knocked him out,
but still his socks remain on.

26:09.458 --> 26:12.438
Although there was some
encouraging sock movement,

26:12.438 --> 26:16.341
Even a punch 15 times that
of a heavyweight boxer

26:16.341 --> 26:20.261
Couldn't separate Buster's
legs from his socks.

26:22.233 --> 26:23.882
So, the myth that you can punch

26:23.882 --> 26:25.895
someone out of their
socks Is busted.

26:25.895 --> 26:27.031
The uppercut couldn't do it.

26:27.031 --> 26:28.169
The right hook couldn't do it.

26:28.169 --> 26:31.112
Even the super body
blow could not do it.

26:31.112 --> 26:33.446
They all failed,
even using the socks

26:33.447 --> 26:35.314
That were the easiest to come off.

26:35.315 --> 26:36.775
But don't worry.
We're not gonna give up.

26:36.775 --> 26:38.604
We're gonna keep trying.

26:41.311 --> 26:42.344
After the break...

26:42.345 --> 26:43.812
Let's go twice as fast.

26:43.813 --> 26:47.081
...Adam and Jamie drive
another car up the wall.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.997
Please do not try what we
do on this show at home.

26:51.997 --> 26:53.697
We're what you call experts.

26:53.698 --> 26:55.699
It's safer that way.

26:59.137 --> 27:01.837
Adam and Jamie are
having a smashing time...

27:03.338 --> 27:05.238
...All in the name of physics.

27:06.341 --> 27:07.639
How did we get here?

27:07.640 --> 27:10.273
Well, it all started
when Jamie said this.

27:10.274 --> 27:13.152
Both trucks were traveling
at about 50 miles an hour.

27:13.152 --> 27:15.457
That's equivalent
to a single impact

27:15.457 --> 27:19.380
Going into a solid wall
at 100 miles an hour.

27:19.381 --> 27:22.112
That's pretty sound
reasoning for my money.

27:22.112 --> 27:23.913
But, no, the fans cried.

27:23.914 --> 27:26.182
2 cars hitting each other
at 50 miles per hour

27:26.183 --> 27:28.652
Do not equal one car hitting
a wall at 100 miles per hour.

27:28.652 --> 27:30.954
Because their mass is the same,
they cancel each other out,

27:30.955 --> 27:31.675
And it's no different

27:31.675 --> 27:34.395
than one car hitting a
wall At 50 miles an hour.

27:34.396 --> 27:36.491
I find this surprising and
hard to wrap my head around,

27:36.491 --> 27:38.843
But our scale experiment
seemed to bear it out.

27:40.152 --> 27:42.060
But, of course,
we're not gonna leave it there.

27:42.060 --> 27:42.979
This is what happens

27:42.979 --> 27:45.923
when you crash a car
into a wall S an hour.

27:45.963 --> 27:48.397
Next up, we're gonna be
crashin caa into a wall

27:48.397 --> 27:49.966
At 100 miles an hour.

27:49.966 --> 27:51.799
How bad will it be?

27:51.800 --> 27:54.830
We're just gonna have
to crash it to find out.

27:54.831 --> 27:56.984
So an identical car,

27:56.984 --> 27:59.248
Well, except for the
fact it's lemon yellow...

27:59.248 --> 28:01.799
That's good. Bring it straight in.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.434
...Is hooked up to the track.

28:03.435 --> 28:04.735
All right.

28:04.736 --> 28:06.903
Now, the 50-mile-per-hour impact

28:06.904 --> 28:09.409
Clocked an impressive 58 g's.

28:09.409 --> 28:13.777
But will doubling the speed
double the damage to this car?

28:13.777 --> 28:14.810
It's good.

28:14.811 --> 28:16.264
I got to say that after watching

28:16.264 --> 28:18.182
That 50-mile-an-hour
crash into the wall,

28:19.320 --> 28:20.887
I have a really
hard time imagining

28:20.888 --> 28:22.389
That the 100-mile-per-hour crash

28:22.390 --> 28:24.991
Is gonna compress the
car that much more.

28:25.425 --> 28:26.369
I don't know.

28:27.861 --> 28:30.563
So are you ready for some
more wanton destruction?

28:30.564 --> 28:33.032
I am! Let's go twice as fast!

28:33.033 --> 28:34.100
All right.

28:35.969 --> 28:37.670
Wanton destruction it is,

28:37.671 --> 28:40.669
As the Mythbusters
retire to a safe distance

28:40.670 --> 28:43.435
And the countdown begins.

28:43.436 --> 28:44.813
You ready to make this happen?

28:44.813 --> 28:45.758
I can't wait.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.605
I haven't seen a
100-mile-an-hour crash before.

28:48.605 --> 28:49.239
No.

28:49.239 --> 28:52.807
All right, commence with the
100-mile-per-hour crash.

28:53.350 --> 28:56.657
On Adam's command,
the engines whir into life,

28:56.657 --> 29:01.460
Straining to get the car up
to exactly 100 miles per hour.

29:03.022 --> 29:04.656
It hurtles down the track.

29:04.657 --> 29:07.224
It's going flat-out. Wow.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.513
The cable uncouples,

29:09.514 --> 29:12.911
And the car plows into
its final destination.

29:22.435 --> 29:26.069
The guys are
understandably speechless.

29:27.007 --> 29:30.740
That impact crushed the
lemon car with such force,

29:30.741 --> 29:34.551
It should be in a glass with
ice and a cocktail umbrella.

29:38.846 --> 29:40.679
It's in a very different state

29:40.680 --> 29:42.680
Than it was at 50 miles per hour.

29:43.190 --> 29:44.685
Yeah, it's a little shorter.

29:44.685 --> 29:47.853
I mean, we got a clear difference
between the two crashes.

29:47.854 --> 29:49.254
Uh-huh.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.554
I can't wait to see
what the data set says

29:51.555 --> 29:52.342
About the "G" Load.

29:52.342 --> 29:54.676
If the data's still intact.

29:54.677 --> 29:57.012
If anything's still intact.

29:58.585 --> 30:00.900
Well, thanks to its
position in the trunk,

30:00.900 --> 30:03.601
The black box survived.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.621
So did we successfully
retrieve anything?

30:05.621 --> 30:07.388
We got good data. Really?!

30:07.389 --> 30:10.409
Yeah, we got a peak on
the left side of 140

30:10.409 --> 30:12.313
And a peak on the
right side of 230.

30:12.313 --> 30:15.300
And we'd normally just average
those to get a result in there.

30:15.300 --> 30:17.700
So the midpoint's
somewhere around 185?

30:17.701 --> 30:19.883
185. That's nice.

30:19.883 --> 30:21.072
That's significantly more than --

30:21.073 --> 30:23.207
What was the last one, 58? 58.

30:25.143 --> 30:26.410
Data!

30:27.581 --> 30:30.953
3 times the g's of the
50-mile-per-hour test

30:30.953 --> 30:32.858
Is certainly significant.

30:32.859 --> 30:37.630
But that's not the only
data set they're collecting.

30:37.631 --> 30:40.667
Before, it was 15 feet.

30:42.136 --> 30:44.103
Now it's 8 feet.

30:44.321 --> 30:46.421
So not only did the
"G" Load triple,

30:46.422 --> 30:49.892
The crash compacted
almost half of the car.

30:49.893 --> 30:53.361
And remember --
these two cars were identical.

30:55.913 --> 30:58.171
This may just seem like
some gratuitous violence,

30:58.171 --> 31:00.832
But there's actually some really
interesting science going on

31:00.832 --> 31:02.884
When you compare
these two impacts.

31:02.884 --> 31:05.519
You would think that
doubling the speed

31:05.520 --> 31:08.624
Would give you twice the
severity of the impact,

31:08.625 --> 31:11.127
But the physics says
you're actually looking at

31:11.128 --> 31:13.866
More like four times the
severity of the impact.

31:13.866 --> 31:17.635
Our sensors are showing
three times the g's

31:17.635 --> 31:21.209
And our wreckage is showing
about twice the damage.

31:21.209 --> 31:23.176
So what's going on here?

31:23.177 --> 31:25.822
Well, just like this can...

31:26.528 --> 31:29.220
The more I crush it,
the more it resists crushing.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.454
There's some complex
physics going on here,

31:31.455 --> 31:34.822
But you don't have to be a rocket
scientist to understand it.

31:34.823 --> 31:37.200
The cars speak for themselves.

31:38.199 --> 31:39.265
They certainly do.

31:39.266 --> 31:41.934
And after two spectacular crashes,

31:41.935 --> 31:46.404
They have their benchmarks
for car carnage.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.597
Well, we've got our data points.

31:48.597 --> 31:49.763
And they are lovely.

31:49.764 --> 31:52.267
I guess it's time to move
on to the main event.

31:52.268 --> 31:53.372
Yep.

31:55.343 --> 31:56.343
Next up...

31:56.344 --> 31:58.344
Hold on to your socks, Buster!

31:58.344 --> 32:01.798
...The Mythbusters think
outside the boxing ring.

32:06.877 --> 32:09.045
All right, look,
we've tried everything,

32:09.046 --> 32:10.913
But even with superhuman strength

32:10.914 --> 32:12.747
And the best-case-scenario sock,

32:12.748 --> 32:15.650
You still can't knock someone's
socks off with a punch.

32:15.651 --> 32:18.785
No, but I think if we take
this outside the boxing ring,

32:18.786 --> 32:20.220
We're gonna see some results.

32:20.221 --> 32:21.688
Yeah, but last time
we ramped this up,

32:21.689 --> 32:23.089
We used that frightening,
huge pendulum,

32:23.090 --> 32:24.244
And we still got nowhere.

32:26.659 --> 32:28.026
You know what?
That's another fan complaint.

32:28.027 --> 32:29.194
Here, listen.

32:29.195 --> 32:32.596
"Your pendulum hit
Buster at a lower speed

32:32.597 --> 32:33.616
"Than your punching rig,

32:33.616 --> 32:36.799
So this test was actually a
ramp down rather than up."

32:36.800 --> 32:38.867
Yeah, but it did weigh a lot more.

32:38.868 --> 32:40.335
True. But you know what?

32:40.336 --> 32:42.203
To directly address that concern,

32:42.204 --> 32:45.505
Why don't we increase both
the mass and the speed?

32:45.506 --> 32:47.206
Okay, okay. How about this?

32:47.750 --> 32:49.875
Big steel girder.
We weld it to a truck.

32:49.875 --> 32:52.711
We drive straight at Buster,
and bam!

32:54.279 --> 32:57.248
For the final knockout round,

32:57.249 --> 32:58.649
They're heading to alameda

32:58.650 --> 33:02.852
To definitively ramp this
myth up once and for all.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.063
Brian, thank you so much for
bringing your truck out.

33:06.063 --> 33:07.615
Now, tell me what
this thing can do.

33:07.615 --> 33:10.536
This truck is about 20,
000-pounds-plus loaded.

33:10.536 --> 33:13.338
It's turbo diesel, can reach
speeds of 80 miles an hour,

33:13.339 --> 33:14.805
And it's ready to
take down Buster.

33:15.203 --> 33:17.388
I think this is the right truck.

33:18.309 --> 33:20.928
So you guys felt like the
pendulum wasn't good enough.

33:20.928 --> 33:22.259
Well, this is what I have for you.

33:22.259 --> 33:25.433
What I have here is a
600-pound steel beam

33:25.433 --> 33:28.502
That I'm about to weld to this 13,
000-pound truck.

33:28.503 --> 33:30.037
It's a simple build --

33:30.038 --> 33:33.973
One giant girder welded
to one turbocharged truck.

33:34.557 --> 33:36.572
All right, time to fight.

33:36.572 --> 33:37.952
And voilÃ .

33:37.952 --> 33:42.591
Mass plus speed equals the
behemoth of all battering rams,

33:42.591 --> 33:44.325
While further down the range,

33:44.326 --> 33:46.760
Grant sets up his
laser quick release

33:46.761 --> 33:51.197
And Kari erects the structure
for Buster's last stand.

33:51.198 --> 33:54.100
Now, I've built a nice
little balanced structure

33:54.101 --> 33:55.835
So that Buster can hang,

33:55.836 --> 33:58.375
And then I'm painting
the entire thing yellow,

33:58.375 --> 33:59.542
Maybe a little bit of pink,

33:59.543 --> 34:01.011
So that you can see
it from far, far away,

34:01.012 --> 34:03.045
Because it's gonna be
a really long run-up.

34:03.489 --> 34:06.491
Once Kari's hangman
harness is complete,

34:06.492 --> 34:08.011
It's time to guide that girder

34:08.011 --> 34:10.561
Right into Buster's
reinforced guts.

34:10.562 --> 34:12.129
And they're going to start

34:12.130 --> 34:16.065
At a bone-crunching
40 miles per hour.

34:16.065 --> 34:17.822
We are about to hit Buster

34:17.822 --> 34:21.764
With 4,000 times the
power as any boxer

34:21.764 --> 34:24.350
To see whether or not we
can knock his socks off.

34:24.350 --> 34:26.551
I have a feeling we're
gonna knock his legs off

34:26.552 --> 34:29.053
Before his socks come off,
but let's see what happens.

34:29.054 --> 34:32.351
Remember, Buster is wearing
the socks of least resistance

34:32.351 --> 34:34.132
On his human-like legs.

34:34.132 --> 34:37.634
He'll be standing on all 180
pounds of his own weight,

34:37.635 --> 34:41.203
And at impact, he'll be hit with 4,
000 times the force

34:41.204 --> 34:43.538
Of a heavyweight-boxing punch.

34:43.539 --> 34:46.324
Will that be enough
for the socks to fly?

34:46.324 --> 34:47.985
All right, getting into position.

34:47.985 --> 34:50.886
This is human-like surface

34:50.886 --> 34:53.219
With the socks of
least resistance,

34:53.221 --> 34:55.554
Buster on his own weight.

34:55.556 --> 34:57.357
Go at 40 miles an hour.

34:57.358 --> 34:59.925
Here we go in 3, 2, 1.

34:59.926 --> 35:01.559
Coming at you.

35:02.212 --> 35:05.992
The truck speeds down the
track at 40 miles per hour...

35:07.059 --> 35:09.093
Come on. Do it.

35:09.094 --> 35:11.228
...Triggers the quick release.

35:11.229 --> 35:14.331
Yeah!

35:14.332 --> 35:15.499
Contact.

35:22.139 --> 35:25.308
Ow. Didn't knock his socks off,
but it knocked his hand off.

35:27.544 --> 35:29.312
His hand flew off.

35:29.313 --> 35:32.115
Buhis socks are still on.

35:32.116 --> 35:33.616
We nailed him.

35:34.246 --> 35:36.721
The giant girder made contact,

35:36.721 --> 35:39.769
But it still wasn't
a socks-off knock.

35:40.929 --> 35:43.520
However, there is good news.

35:44.657 --> 35:45.857
Look at that.

35:45.858 --> 35:48.259
They almost came off at the heel!

35:48.260 --> 35:50.526
It almost lifted him
out of his socks.

35:50.526 --> 35:52.934
Well, you know what that means.
We have to ramp it up.

35:52.934 --> 35:54.834
Yeah. You know what?
This will go 65.

35:54.835 --> 35:57.069
With all this weight,
65 miles an hour

35:57.070 --> 35:58.470
Might be enough to
knock his socks off.

35:58.471 --> 35:59.677
Let's do it. Let's do it.

36:00.181 --> 36:02.935
We're going to hit him
at 65 miles an hour

36:02.935 --> 36:04.268
With this steel beam.

36:04.269 --> 36:07.505
And it's gonna be not two
or three times more powerful

36:07.506 --> 36:09.339
Than a human boxer.

36:09.340 --> 36:13.910
It's gonna be 10,000 times
more powerful than that boxer.

36:14.719 --> 36:17.226
Surely this has got
to be the thing

36:17.226 --> 36:19.127
That knocks him out of his socks.

36:19.128 --> 36:20.661
"Surely" Is right.

36:20.662 --> 36:23.506
If 10,000 times the
force of a boxer

36:23.506 --> 36:27.642
Can't knock the socks off Buster,
then it can't be done.

36:27.643 --> 36:29.443
I think we've really
got a chance here.

36:29.444 --> 36:31.245
We got all the elements.

36:31.246 --> 36:33.014
All right, let's do it.

36:33.015 --> 36:37.803
All right, let's him
at 65 miles an hour.

36:38.219 --> 36:41.888
Here we go.
This is the main event!

36:41.889 --> 36:44.718
Let's see if we can knock
Buster's socks off!

36:44.718 --> 36:46.510
The truck takes its position.

36:46.510 --> 36:48.811
Then it's pedal to the metal...

36:48.812 --> 36:51.213
50 miles an hour!

36:51.214 --> 36:53.415
...As it thunders down the track.

36:53.416 --> 36:55.549
Ho on toour socks, Buster!

36:55.550 --> 36:57.417
65 miles an hour.

37:01.655 --> 37:04.991
Houston, we have lift-off.

37:04.992 --> 37:08.394
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
We knocked his socks off!

37:08.395 --> 37:09.367
Dude!

37:10.029 --> 37:13.031
Oh, my God!
We knocked his socks off!

37:13.032 --> 37:15.666
I turned around, all I could
see was like an explosion,

37:15.667 --> 37:19.203
And I saw twsocks floating
down to the ground.

37:19.204 --> 37:20.570
There you have it.

37:20.571 --> 37:25.074
One 30-million-newton knock,
one desocked Buster,

37:25.075 --> 37:28.610
And three ecstatic Mythbusters.

37:28.611 --> 37:31.078
But one question remains.

37:31.079 --> 37:34.848
My big question is -- what came
off first, socks or the feet?

37:36.817 --> 37:38.384
! Oh! Oh! Oh! Look!

37:38.385 --> 37:40.386
Yes! The socks came off!

37:40.387 --> 37:41.887
Look at that! That's great!

37:41.888 --> 37:43.722
They didn't get dragged off.

37:43.723 --> 37:46.391
They got knoed off.

37:46.829 --> 37:48.793
After the first time I
heard this boxing myth,

37:48.794 --> 37:51.795
I thought to myself,
"Who knows? Maybe it's possible."

37:51.796 --> 37:54.415
But after we first tested it,
I thought there is no way

37:54.415 --> 37:56.850
You can knock somebody's
socks off until now.

37:56.851 --> 38:00.098
After seeing what I just saw,
we hit Buster,

38:00.098 --> 38:03.334
Knocked him out of his socks,
it's possible.

38:03.335 --> 38:06.637
I mean, a boxer couldn't do it,
but we could.

38:06.638 --> 38:09.806
So after 20-some-odd sock tests,
multiple punches,

38:09.807 --> 38:13.977
Does the phrase "Knock your
socks off" Still hold true?

38:13.978 --> 38:18.236
Yes, as a matter of fact,
you can knock someone's socks off.

38:18.236 --> 38:20.648
The caveat ishat it's gonna take

38:20.649 --> 38:24.050
10,000 times what
a boxer could do.

38:24.051 --> 38:28.720
So, yes, you can use the phrase,
but use it lightly.

38:31.924 --> 38:35.292
Up next, the Mythbusters
head headlong...

38:36.761 --> 38:38.629
...Into a head-on collision.

38:45.089 --> 38:49.058
This car right here hit a
wall at 50 miles an hour.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.367
This car hit a wall
at 100 miles an hour.

38:54.368 --> 38:56.469
I think the difference
is pretty clear.

38:56.470 --> 38:57.459
The question is,

38:57.459 --> 39:00.205
When we smack two cars
together at 50 miles an hour,

39:00.206 --> 39:01.839
Are they gonna look like that,

39:01.840 --> 39:03.674
Or are they gonna look like this?

39:03.675 --> 39:06.442
We're gonna smasretwmoo
cars just to find out!

39:06.443 --> 39:09.978
It's the final act
of carmageddon --

39:09.979 --> 39:13.848
2 cars in a 50-mile-per-hour
head-on collision.

39:15.083 --> 39:16.717
Here's how this breaks down.

39:16.718 --> 39:19.820
At this end of the track,
the yellow car.

39:19.821 --> 39:22.323
And at this end
sits the orange car.

39:22.324 --> 39:25.293
And here in the middle,
these two cars will meet

39:25.294 --> 39:28.162
In a 50-mile-per-hour
handshake of destruction

39:28.163 --> 39:31.234
That will hopefully answer
all of the questions we have

39:31.234 --> 39:33.901
About the crash forces involved.

39:33.902 --> 39:36.069
Adam's predicting those answers

39:36.070 --> 39:37.938
Will give the thumbs-up to Newton.

39:37.939 --> 39:40.373
This one has really
been a brain bender,

39:40.374 --> 39:42.442
But I have a prediction
for this final experiment.

39:42.443 --> 39:44.144
I think that when all
is said and done,

39:44.145 --> 39:46.180
It's gonna prove
that Jamie was wrong

39:46.180 --> 39:47.380
And that the fans
were actually right,

39:47.381 --> 39:48.948
That when these 2 cars hit at 50,

39:48.949 --> 39:51.217
They're gonna look like the
car that hit the wall at 50,

39:51.218 --> 39:53.719
Not the one that hit
the wall at 100.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.688
And Jamie agrees.

39:55.689 --> 39:58.157
Based on our small-scale testing,

39:58.158 --> 40:00.659
What we should see at the end
of this head-on collision

40:00.660 --> 40:02.528
Should look pretty much Like

40:02.528 --> 40:05.467
the 50-mile-an-hour
crash against a wall.

40:07.567 --> 40:10.450
It's crunch time for force impact.

40:10.450 --> 40:13.617
Will the full-scale test
prove the fans right?

40:14.828 --> 40:15.927
That's it.

40:18.229 --> 40:20.462
Well, I think it's time
to do the final test.

40:20.462 --> 40:21.469
They're all set out there.

40:21.469 --> 40:23.567
It would seem so. I'm goa call it.

40:24.067 --> 40:26.500
Bring on the head-on collision!

40:29.661 --> 40:32.095
From each end of the 1,
280-foot track,

40:32.096 --> 40:35.898
The identical 1.
5-ton cars take off.

40:39.035 --> 40:42.670
Both cars gain speed as they
head headlong down the track

40:42.671 --> 40:44.846
Towards their head-on collision.

40:47.175 --> 40:50.577
Then as both cars reach
50 miles per hour...

40:50.578 --> 40:51.978
It about to happen.

40:52.544 --> 40:54.345
...Theables unuple.

41:01.818 --> 41:04.119
That was spectacular.

41:05.446 --> 41:07.180
What can you say?

41:07.181 --> 41:08.781
nothing.

41:08.782 --> 41:10.349
What can you say?

41:11.049 --> 41:13.149
Th breathtakinfinale

41:13.150 --> 41:17.028
Is the final piece of
tir physics puzzle.

41:18.820 --> 41:22.050
And as the Mythbusters
survey the wreck Of a 2-car,

41:22.050 --> 41:24.523
50-mile-per-hour pileup,

41:24.523 --> 41:27.523
They're playing spot the differee.

41:27.524 --> 41:30.257
There's a windshield between them.

41:30.258 --> 41:32.386
It's pretty evident, isn't it?

41:32.386 --> 41:34.053
It really is.

41:34.053 --> 41:37.688
It looks just like the
50-mile-an-hour against-a-wa crash.

41:37.689 --> 41:40.124
And nothing likehe 100. Nope.

41:40.125 --> 41:43.160
Amazing.

41:46.264 --> 41:48.298
This tells me the whole story.

41:48.299 --> 41:51.333
I don't needo see the
accelerometer data or ything.

41:51.334 --> 41:54.369
These 2 carswhich hit each
other at 50 miles an hour,

41:54.370 --> 41:57.173
Lookxactly like the car
we smacked into the wall

41:57.174 --> 41:58.641
At 50 les an hour.

41:58.642 --> 42:01.844
That tells me everything
I need to know.

42:01.845 --> 42:03.812
Well, the figures are in.

42:03.813 --> 42:06.281
The orange car got 52 g's.

42:06.282 --> 42:08.750
The yellow car got 58 g's,

42:08.751 --> 42:11.123
Which, give or take a few g's,

42:11.123 --> 42:13.690
Is the same as what
we got against a wall

42:13.691 --> 42:15.191
At 50 miles an hour.

42:15.192 --> 42:17.426
Gee whiz.

42:17.427 --> 42:19.929
And the dama data backs
up those numbers.

42:19.930 --> 42:22.600
Both of the cars are
virtually the same length

42:22.601 --> 42:27.484
As the 50-mile-per-hour
wall test, at 11.5 feet.

42:29.007 --> 42:33.447
And after a spectacular
spe of automive mayhem,

42:33.447 --> 42:35.346
There is irrefutable proof

42:35.347 --> 42:39.282
That those physicist
fans had it right.

42:39.834 --> 42:41.367
Wton's third law --

42:41.368 --> 42:44.837
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction --

42:44.838 --> 42:46.138
Holds true.

42:46.139 --> 42:49.174
Although the 2-car crash
at 50 miles per hour

42:49.175 --> 42:50.709
Doubles the speed,

42:50.710 --> 42:52.210
The energy of the crash

42:52.211 --> 42:55.079
Is transferred to twice the mass,
halving it,

42:55.080 --> 42:59.283
Resulting in a crash that looks
like just oncar into a wall

42:59.284 --> 43:01.418
At 50 miles per hour.

43:01.419 --> 43:03.854
I made a statement th two
cars hitting each other

43:03.855 --> 43:05.188
At 50 miles an hour

43:05.189 --> 43:09.125
Was the same as one car
hitting a soliwall at 100.

43:09.126 --> 43:10.627
That was a mistake.

43:10.628 --> 43:12.896
But you know what?
I'm okay with it.

43:12.897 --> 43:15.198
That's how you learn stuff.

43:15.199 --> 43:17.698
Love smashing stuff for science!

43:17.699 --> 43:20.734
One way or another,
it's all just shrapnel.

43:20.934 --> 43:31.134
