01:50.770 --> 01:52.570
Melanie
Lauzon, is that correct?

01:52.572 --> 01:54.639
Yes, that's me.

01:54.641 --> 01:56.140
You are here to
report a sexual assault,

01:56.142 --> 01:57.375
is that correct?

01:57.377 --> 01:59.243
Yes.

01:59.245 --> 02:00.545
You can give
a written statement

02:00.547 --> 02:04.181
or an oral one, we have
a recording device here.

02:04.183 --> 02:07.184
I don't think
I can write right now.

02:07.186 --> 02:10.322
Whenever you're ready.

02:10.324 --> 02:12.690
What do
you want me to say?

02:12.692 --> 02:15.192
Just
say what happened.

02:15.194 --> 02:17.329
I don't remember
what happened exactly,

02:17.331 --> 02:19.065
a lot of it's a blur.

02:20.534 --> 02:22.033
I don't remember much.

02:22.035 --> 02:23.701
Just tell me
what you can remember.

02:23.703 --> 02:27.038
What is the last thing you
remember before it happened?

02:27.040 --> 02:31.543
Um, my friends
and I were leaving the college

02:31.545 --> 02:33.146
to go out drinking.

02:34.047 --> 02:35.382
We took the bus.

02:37.216 --> 02:39.216
Route 7, I believe?

02:39.218 --> 02:41.453
Where do
you attend school?

02:41.455 --> 02:43.254
Windsor.

02:43.256 --> 02:44.856
What are you studying?

02:44.858 --> 02:46.526
Biology.

02:48.061 --> 02:49.727
Did you
drink, or take any drugs

02:49.729 --> 02:51.963
before you arrived?

02:51.965 --> 02:55.032
To be honest,
I did smoke some weed.

02:55.034 --> 02:58.670
And we had a few
drinks before I left.

02:58.672 --> 02:59.971
Do you
think that could have

02:59.973 --> 03:01.439
affected your judgment?

03:01.441 --> 03:03.541
What is
that supposed to mean?

03:03.543 --> 03:04.776
That smoking weed

03:04.778 --> 03:07.345
could have affected
your judgment.

03:07.347 --> 03:09.113
I mean, I
guess it could have,

03:09.115 --> 03:11.749
but I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

03:11.751 --> 03:14.952
Did you have
anything to drink at the club?

03:14.954 --> 03:16.220
Yes.

03:16.222 --> 03:17.855
How much?

03:17.857 --> 03:20.392
Um, a lot.

03:20.394 --> 03:23.628
After about four or five
I got really drowsy,

03:23.630 --> 03:26.163
and don't remember much else.

03:26.165 --> 03:29.367
Do you
remember leaving?

03:29.369 --> 03:32.103
No, not
really, I blacked out.

03:32.105 --> 03:35.473
It was scary, it was confusing.

03:35.475 --> 03:37.609
Anything else?

03:37.611 --> 03:41.781
I
remember an intense pounding.

03:43.116 --> 03:47.018
I remember beautiful
things, like flowers,

03:47.020 --> 03:49.020
and other things.

03:49.022 --> 03:51.756
And I also remember
really horrible things,

03:51.758 --> 03:53.660
like blood, and skulls.

03:57.296 --> 04:01.234
He had a birthmark, it
was shaped like a flower.

04:02.602 --> 04:07.104
They were large, I'd never
seen anything like them before.

04:07.106 --> 04:10.908
And I woke up somewhere
I'd never been before.

04:10.910 --> 04:13.611
At a
different location.

04:13.613 --> 04:16.113
I don't
know, I blacked out, I,

04:16.115 --> 04:18.882
I vaguely remember
being at a bus shelter

04:18.885 --> 04:21.887
a few kilometers
away from the club.

04:24.123 --> 04:27.459
When I woke up, I
was in intense pain.

04:27.461 --> 04:32.063
I'd been badly beaten,
I was covered in blood.

04:32.065 --> 04:33.431
Were you
sexually active

04:33.433 --> 04:35.032
in the days before the incident?

04:35.034 --> 04:37.401
No, I'm a virgin!

04:37.403 --> 04:38.636
Do you
think anyone you know

04:38.638 --> 04:40.605
could have done this to you?

04:40.607 --> 04:43.475
No,
not that I can think of.

04:43.477 --> 04:45.810
I asked Sarah,
she's the one who,

04:45.812 --> 04:47.244
I woke up in her apartment,

04:47.246 --> 04:50.682
she found me in the bus
shelter, passed out.

04:50.684 --> 04:52.686
She thought I was drunk.

04:54.087 --> 04:55.953
Since it's taken
you more than 96 hours

04:55.955 --> 04:59.290
to report this, we
can't get his DNA.

04:59.292 --> 05:01.292
Are you sure you don't
know who did this to you?

05:01.294 --> 05:02.529
No!

05:04.030 --> 05:07.298
OK, I'll
be right back.

06:07.561 --> 06:09.829
Don't ever do that again.

06:29.482 --> 06:30.984
Hello?

06:32.118 --> 06:32.952
Hello?

06:34.554 --> 06:35.887
Melanie?

06:35.889 --> 06:37.188
Oh, hi.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.623
Hi, Mom.

06:38.625 --> 06:41.693
Just one second, I'm
gonna put you on speaker.

06:41.695 --> 06:42.528
Hey.

06:43.897 --> 06:44.996
Yeah, I'm
just returning your call,

06:44.998 --> 06:46.831
why were you calling?

06:46.833 --> 06:50.067
This is actually
really hard of me to ask,

06:50.069 --> 06:53.971
but um, with Joseph's
birthday coming up,

06:53.973 --> 06:56.073
and rent, and the groceries,

06:56.075 --> 06:59.811
I really need to
borrow from you again.

06:59.813 --> 07:01.278
I can't
keep doing this.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.480
It seems to be every
two months now.

07:03.482 --> 07:05.116
Joseph have a job yet?

07:05.118 --> 07:06.584
Yeah, he went to work today.

07:06.586 --> 07:09.989
I promise this is the
last time, I swear.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.324
Are you
still gambling?

07:13.326 --> 07:15.929
No, I haven't been in months.

07:17.196 --> 07:20.464
I don't even play
the lottery anymore.

07:20.466 --> 07:21.599
We think
you should come home,

07:21.601 --> 07:23.500
Joseph's really bad for you.

07:23.502 --> 07:26.403
You were supposed
to go to school.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.205
I know, I
know, but things happened

07:28.207 --> 07:30.007
that I didn't plan, you know,

07:30.009 --> 07:32.376
and I'm just trying
to deal with it.

07:32.378 --> 07:34.511
You know, if I had the
resources, I'd go to school,

07:34.513 --> 07:35.613
but I don't.

07:35.615 --> 07:36.683
Can you help?

07:38.117 --> 07:39.984
OK, I
guess we can put some money

07:39.986 --> 07:41.585
into your account.

07:41.587 --> 07:46.023
Your father and I talked about
this, and this needs to stop.

07:46.025 --> 07:49.293
Yeah, I know, I
know, thank you so much, Mom.

07:49.295 --> 07:50.962
I love you so much.

07:50.964 --> 07:53.130
Joe, do you have anything
you want to say to Grandma?

07:53.132 --> 07:54.932
Hi, Grandma.

07:54.934 --> 07:57.969
Hi honey, I
hope to see you soon.

07:57.971 --> 08:00.872
Yeah, we'll come
by for a visit real soon.

08:00.874 --> 08:03.708
Thank you, have a good night.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.544
Good night.

13:34.807 --> 13:37.041
These scandals,
plus many instances

13:37.043 --> 13:40.044
of actual sexual assault,
have prompted debates

13:40.046 --> 13:43.347
about rape culture on
campuses across the country.

13:43.349 --> 13:45.849
Jokes about
rape, comments about rape,

13:45.851 --> 13:48.819
songs about rape,
depictions about rape,

13:48.821 --> 13:52.992
are trivialized or made to
seem commonplace and everyday.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.227
Universities,
including U of O,

13:56.229 --> 13:59.530
have promised change, and
focus on the need for consent.

13:59.532 --> 14:00.797
We have work to do.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.266
That was last year.

14:02.268 --> 14:04.235
This was this week.

14:04.237 --> 14:06.470
We begin tonight
with a disturbing story

14:06.472 --> 14:09.206
from the University of Ottawa.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.974
The Science
Students' Association

14:10.976 --> 14:13.877
organized that pub
crawl with a contest.

14:13.879 --> 14:15.346
The student newspaper article

14:15.348 --> 14:17.881
says students were
encouraged to strip,

14:17.883 --> 14:21.052
and have oral and
once at least anal sex

14:21.054 --> 14:23.354
with the event judges, all male.

14:23.356 --> 14:26.523
And that if they
did they won points.

14:26.525 --> 14:27.858
There are
reports of sexual harassment

14:27.860 --> 14:29.593
out of that event
every single year.

14:29.595 --> 14:31.428
There are reports of
coercion out of that event,

14:31.430 --> 14:34.331
and of assault, like almost
every year that it's happened.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.899
But some
pub-crawl participants

14:35.901 --> 14:39.236
are pushing back, saying
everything was consensual.

14:39.238 --> 14:43.342
And that it was a sexually
liberating experience.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.043
I'm joined by our panelists.

14:46.045 --> 14:49.080
Supriya Dwivedi is a columnist
with the Toronto Sun.

14:49.082 --> 14:51.582
Elamin Abdelmahmoud
is social media editor

14:51.584 --> 14:53.217
at Buzzfeed Canada.

14:53.219 --> 14:57.054
And Jonathan Kay is editor-in-chief
of Walrus magazine.

14:57.056 --> 14:59.390
So, Elamin I'm gonna start
with you on this one.

14:59.392 --> 15:01.492
The details are
a little sketchy,

15:01.494 --> 15:03.527
and the report of exactly
what happened this year,

15:03.529 --> 15:06.230
or in previous years, a lot of
it, most of it's secondhand.

15:06.232 --> 15:10.501
But if it's true that older,
male students, judges,

15:10.503 --> 15:12.736
were setting up this
list and encouraging

15:12.738 --> 15:16.107
these younger students to
participate for points,

15:16.109 --> 15:19.176
how problematic is that,
is that rape culture,

15:19.178 --> 15:21.745
or is that just a wild night?

15:21.747 --> 15:23.247
To me, I
look at these details,

15:23.249 --> 15:26.016
and look and see a perfect
example of rape culture.

15:26.018 --> 15:29.153
It's a perfect example because
these students were going

15:29.155 --> 15:31.322
and they didn't really know
what they were consenting to.

15:31.324 --> 15:34.057
They knew that this event was
going to be particularly wild,

15:34.059 --> 15:37.161
but the fact that consent
was implied in this event

15:37.163 --> 15:39.263
indicates that it is
rape culture, right?

15:39.265 --> 15:41.932
So like we don't have a
situation where you can

15:41.934 --> 15:44.168
consent to something you
don't know beforehand.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.936
I think that creates
an environment

15:45.938 --> 15:47.371
where rape culture
really thrives.

15:47.373 --> 15:49.005
What do you think?

15:49.007 --> 15:51.575
Look, rape culture,
we know that it's real

15:51.577 --> 15:53.877
in some instances, but I'm
not sure this is rape culture.

15:53.879 --> 15:57.047
This seems like the new Puritanism
coming from the left...

15:57.049 --> 15:58.217
Let's see...

16:07.193 --> 16:10.161
It's very unsettling,
you've got women and men,

16:10.163 --> 16:13.164
acting this extremely
unwholesome way,

16:13.166 --> 16:14.865
but does it sound like rape,

16:14.867 --> 16:16.700
does it sound like there's
no consent involved?

16:16.702 --> 16:18.369
You actually had
two letter writers

16:18.371 --> 16:20.137
writing to the student
newspaper saying,

16:20.139 --> 16:24.341
look, you know, butt out, we
did this of our own volition,

16:24.343 --> 16:26.943
there was consent, we found
it sexually liberating,

16:26.945 --> 16:28.479
we are proud of what we did.

16:28.481 --> 16:31.014
And what's ironic is when I
was younger this was coming

16:31.016 --> 16:32.949
from the right side of
the political spectrum.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.018
You had socially
conservative Christians

16:35.020 --> 16:37.921
who were complaining that
campus life had been too sexual.

16:37.923 --> 16:39.790
Now it's from the left side
of the political spectrum

16:39.792 --> 16:41.792
you have people calling
out rape culture

16:41.794 --> 16:43.794
whenever people are doing stuff

16:43.796 --> 16:46.163
that they happen
not to approve of,

16:46.165 --> 16:47.698
so it's a new Puritan outlook

16:47.700 --> 16:49.433
but it's coming from the
left side of the spectrum.

16:49.435 --> 16:50.967
Where are
you on this, Supriya?

16:50.969 --> 16:54.871
I gotta say, I think I sort
of agree with John for once,

16:54.873 --> 16:57.374
and I would have to
say whereas I do think

16:57.376 --> 16:59.543
there's definitely a gradation
here that we're seeing,

16:59.545 --> 17:01.111
and the consent thing
is absolutely valid,

17:01.113 --> 17:03.314
to me rape culture has
always meant any culture

17:03.316 --> 17:05.816
wherein the dominant
attitudes towards rape

17:05.818 --> 17:09.386
either facilitate,
excuse, tolerate rapists,

17:09.387 --> 17:11.321
while at the same
time placing the blame

17:11.324 --> 17:13.824
and the onus of rape
prevention onto the victims.

17:13.826 --> 17:16.593
Because there are actual no
allegations of sexual assault

17:16.595 --> 17:20.096
or rape in the situation,
and we're not talking about

17:20.098 --> 17:23.233
victim-blaming here, I think
that consent is absolutely

17:23.236 --> 17:26.770
an issue, I just don't know if
I would call it rape culture.

17:26.771 --> 17:29.773
But I realize we're kind of
getting into the semantics of,

17:29.775 --> 17:31.842
you know, really
the definitions.

17:31.844 --> 17:33.477
I think that
part of the problem here is,

17:33.479 --> 17:35.779
one of the students
said, I mean like listen,

17:35.781 --> 17:36.947
we don't know a lot
about this report.

17:36.949 --> 17:38.181
Right.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.416
But in the
report one student said,

17:39.418 --> 17:41.218
I tried to say no,
but the judges said

17:41.220 --> 17:42.853
that they were not OK with that.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.988
And so when we have an
environment like this,

17:44.990 --> 17:46.490
I think they are going in
and they're creating an event

17:46.492 --> 17:49.926
where consent is implied
and that becomes a problem

17:49.928 --> 17:53.029
because if you look at it as
an event where these students

17:53.031 --> 17:53.964
are just trying to do something

17:53.966 --> 17:55.966
that's sexually fun for them,

17:55.968 --> 17:57.601
totally I can see where
you're coming from,

17:57.603 --> 17:59.169
but to me this wasn't that.

17:59.171 --> 18:00.571
There are lots of kink parties

18:00.573 --> 18:02.239
where people participate
in these things

18:02.241 --> 18:05.442
but they do it with an
understanding and full consent

18:05.444 --> 18:07.177
that what they're going
to participate in,

18:07.179 --> 18:08.445
but this wasn't that.

18:08.447 --> 18:09.980
If I could just
jump in, because I think

18:09.982 --> 18:13.149
we read the same report and I
think if I remember correctly

18:13.151 --> 18:17.354
it was actually the teammates
of one of the women said,

18:17.356 --> 18:19.055
you know, I'm not OK with
this, and the teammates

18:19.057 --> 18:21.091
were actually
encouraging her to do it.

18:21.093 --> 18:23.126
But I mean,
either way it's consent,

18:23.128 --> 18:24.995
it's like being blindsided
when you get in there.

18:24.997 --> 18:27.331
It's unsettling
but there's no allegation

18:27.333 --> 18:28.765
that she couldn't
have just walked out,

18:28.767 --> 18:30.767
what we're talking
about is peer pressure.

18:30.769 --> 18:32.035
But that's
what rape culture is...

18:32.037 --> 18:33.205
No...

18:43.849 --> 18:46.783
Hi Joseph, I'm
surprised to see you.

18:46.785 --> 18:48.454
Your dinner's ready.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.691
I'll get dinner on the table.

18:53.626 --> 18:54.893
Dinner's ready!

18:57.630 --> 18:59.430
So how was your day?

18:59.432 --> 19:01.800
Good, it went well I think.

19:05.904 --> 19:07.304
Would you like some more?

19:07.306 --> 19:09.139
Is that enough for you?

19:09.141 --> 19:10.909
Some more.

19:27.493 --> 19:30.394
I don't think we're
fragile and need protection.

19:30.396 --> 19:31.964
So, how was work?

19:37.836 --> 19:40.771
Fine, I'll talk
about my day then.

19:40.773 --> 19:43.974
You know, I lifted
heavy shit all day,

19:43.976 --> 19:47.813
and now I have to deal
with assholes like you.

19:50.182 --> 19:52.115
What is going on?

19:52.117 --> 19:52.983
What is it?

19:52.985 --> 19:55.185
Nothing.

19:55.187 --> 19:58.121
We don't have to
do this again, do we?

19:58.123 --> 20:02.325
I'm just trying to
enjoy my dinner, OK?

20:02.327 --> 20:05.063
You didn't
fucking go, did you!

20:07.533 --> 20:09.199
Joe, go to your room.

20:09.201 --> 20:10.469
Close the door.

20:11.437 --> 20:12.969
That's how it is, huh?

20:12.971 --> 20:15.772
Couldn't you at least try to
be a good example for my son?

20:15.774 --> 20:17.808
That's right, he's your son.

20:17.810 --> 20:21.313
Yeah, well I hope
he's nothing like you!

20:22.715 --> 20:24.848
Fuck off, you can really
be a bitch sometimes.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.252
Don't talk to me like that!

20:30.656 --> 20:33.492
So what is it now
for us, welfare?

20:46.104 --> 20:47.904
I'm trying my best.

20:47.906 --> 20:50.407
I really wanted that job.

20:50.409 --> 20:54.012
I show up there

20:56.314 --> 20:58.381
I was just too
embarrassed to tell you.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.216
I need you to work.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.685
I know.

21:01.687 --> 21:03.353
He needs new shoes, what
are we supposed to do,

21:03.355 --> 21:05.458
we're barely scraping by.

21:07.493 --> 21:10.763
I can't keep borrowing
from my parents.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.363
We can't live like this anymore,

21:13.365 --> 21:16.099
I can't deal with
this shit anymore.

21:16.101 --> 21:19.605
And don't ever talk
to me that way again.

21:30.616 --> 21:33.650
And I should note that it
appears to be just a PR move

21:33.652 --> 21:35.652
because this is a university
that's spent a lot of money

21:35.654 --> 21:38.589
trying to combat sexual
violence on campus, and this...

22:01.547 --> 22:04.180
I mean,
I do kind of feel myself

22:04.182 --> 22:07.551
blushing a bit 'cause it's a
bit embarrassing to admit that

22:07.553 --> 22:09.886
but it's a conversation that...

22:30.876 --> 22:32.709
Continue
on Finch Avenue West

22:32.711 --> 22:35.213
for one-and-a-half kilometers.

22:38.050 --> 22:39.616
Use the right two
lanes to turn right

22:39.618 --> 22:41.554
onto Finch Avenue West.

22:44.790 --> 22:48.460
In 200 meters, merge
onto Ontario 427 North.

25:24.049 --> 25:26.049
Later on tonight,
it is Blues-Blackhawks,

25:26.051 --> 25:28.819
game four, that one the
St. Louis leads two to one.

25:28.821 --> 25:29.922
9:30 start...

26:45.097 --> 26:46.763
Of the 10
horses that were stranded,

26:46.765 --> 26:48.999
they were able to
save seven of them...

29:35.133 --> 29:36.599
Melanie, can you
help me with this?

29:36.601 --> 29:38.134
What's that?

29:38.136 --> 29:40.303
Can you move these calla
lilies to this cart here.

29:40.305 --> 29:43.839
Move them to the front, I
have a big order to fill.

29:43.841 --> 29:45.708
Yeah, I'll
be there in a sec.

29:45.710 --> 29:47.377
Thanks Melanie, I can
always count on you.

29:52.684 --> 29:53.984
Fuck you.

29:53.986 --> 29:55.487
Fuck you, asshole.

30:38.063 --> 30:41.764
I wondered if you wanted
to join us for a drink after.

30:41.766 --> 30:43.066
I'm really flattered,

30:43.068 --> 30:45.501
but I have to pick up
my son from school.

30:45.503 --> 30:46.504
OK, sorry.

30:47.405 --> 30:48.638
Have yourself a good night.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.240
Yeah, thanks, you too.

31:33.285 --> 31:37.455
37-year-old
Steve Stevens is considered...

35:28.286 --> 35:31.687
My gosh Melanie, hurry up,
we have a big order to fill.

35:31.689 --> 35:33.856
There's no time to
be on your phone.

35:33.858 --> 35:35.425
It's off.

35:35.427 --> 35:37.261
Put it away, please.

35:42.199 --> 35:44.536
Fucking asshole, fuck you.

36:29.414 --> 36:31.080
A $50,000
reward is being offered

36:31.082 --> 36:33.849
for anyone who has information
that leads the arrest of...

36:37.221 --> 36:41.225
Turn left
onto Woodbine Boulevard.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.294
Back in this
country, the remote First Nation

36:45.296 --> 36:48.731
of Kashechewan in northern
Ontario is being evacuated.

37:21.766 --> 37:23.132
What's going on?

37:23.134 --> 37:25.034
It's a small
fire, mostly smoke.

37:25.036 --> 37:26.469
We're just taking
every precaution we can

37:26.471 --> 37:27.570
with the students here.

37:27.572 --> 37:28.838
Where's my son at?

37:28.840 --> 37:31.909
On the west side,
he's still there.

38:10.548 --> 38:12.582
The Opposition
says it is challenging

38:12.584 --> 38:16.351
more than 2 million ballots,
some because their envelopes

38:16.353 --> 38:19.755
inexplicably did not
bear an official seal.

39:37.635 --> 39:39.134
For those stories,

39:39.136 --> 39:42.674
and all the other news of
the day, stay tuned to CBC.

39:46.978 --> 39:48.544
He patrols
the perimeter,

39:48.546 --> 39:51.380
looking for females
ready to mate.

39:51.382 --> 39:53.916
In the distance, a
young bull takes note

39:53.918 --> 39:56.018
of the old bull's
age and posture.

39:56.020 --> 39:58.053
What's going on
here, where's Joey?

39:58.055 --> 39:59.822
You're home?

39:59.824 --> 40:02.257
Yeah, I'm home, where's Joey?

40:02.259 --> 40:03.893
In his room.

40:03.895 --> 40:05.730
I'll look.

40:11.235 --> 40:13.805
Must have snuck out.

40:15.272 --> 40:17.239
What's going on, I mean
I'm away at work all day,

40:17.241 --> 40:19.642
you do nothing, you
could at least watch him.

40:19.644 --> 40:21.476
What, excuse me?

40:21.478 --> 40:22.578
You heard me.

40:22.580 --> 40:23.813
- You do nothing.
- Do nothing?

40:23.815 --> 40:25.180
I do a lot.

40:25.182 --> 40:28.984
You know no one wants
to hire me, so, please.

40:28.986 --> 40:30.653
Give me a break.

40:30.655 --> 40:32.287
I do nothing?

40:32.289 --> 40:35.490
I mean come on, I am working
all day, I come home,

40:35.492 --> 40:37.492
look at this place,
it's a pig sty.

40:37.494 --> 40:39.428
Everything is misplaced.

40:39.430 --> 40:41.897
I mean, I don't even
know where my son is.

40:41.899 --> 40:43.666
Has he even eaten, I don't know.

40:43.668 --> 40:46.035
This is all I do anymore.

40:46.037 --> 40:48.403
I don't have any
friends anymore.

40:48.405 --> 40:49.639
Whatever.

40:49.641 --> 40:52.875
Get a job, whatever.

40:52.877 --> 40:54.409
Can you please
shut the fuck up now?

40:54.411 --> 40:55.945
No.

40:55.947 --> 40:58.714
Can you please shut the
fuck up, you fucking bitch?

40:58.716 --> 41:00.716
Or what, what
are you gonna do?

41:00.718 --> 41:03.585
Can you shut the
fuck up now, OK?

41:03.587 --> 41:05.054
You can understand?

41:05.056 --> 41:08.157
Don't hit me
again you bastard!

41:08.159 --> 41:09.925
How dare you!

41:09.927 --> 41:11.360
Shut the fuck up.

41:11.362 --> 41:12.695
Let me go!

41:13.597 --> 41:15.264
Let me go!

41:28.079 --> 41:29.647
Fuck you, fuck off!

41:37.755 --> 41:39.454
I can't take this anymore.

42:04.315 --> 42:05.547
We don't judge

42:05.549 --> 42:07.082
when people come
through the door.

42:07.084 --> 42:09.752
It is a true sense of community.

42:09.754 --> 42:11.320
The
problem has been compounded

42:11.322 --> 42:12.755
in recent months.

42:12.757 --> 42:16.759
Manitoba has seen an influx
of refugee families...

42:27.304 --> 42:28.738
We just
rely on the fact that

42:28.740 --> 42:30.172
people will give.

44:18.182 --> 44:20.482
Customer
appreciation sale is on now.

44:20.484 --> 44:22.419
Visit erinwoodford.com.

45:07.764 --> 45:10.933
Where have
you been tonight?

45:10.935 --> 45:13.504
Just at the casino.

45:15.239 --> 45:17.907
Come here

45:17.909 --> 45:18.910
It's fine.

45:20.544 --> 45:22.146
Melanie,

45:24.415 --> 45:27.484
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

45:32.123 --> 45:35.626
I didn't mean to go
that far, it's just...

45:39.163 --> 45:42.331
It's been so hard since
I got out of jail, and...

45:42.333 --> 45:45.269
Everything, I fucked
up, I know it.

45:46.837 --> 45:48.637
I know, I know.

45:48.639 --> 45:51.773
Is everything OK between us?

45:51.775 --> 45:53.610
Yeah, yeah I'm cool.

45:54.611 --> 45:56.645
Sure, Melanie?

45:56.647 --> 45:57.980
I love you.

45:57.982 --> 46:01.018
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

46:04.621 --> 46:06.922
OK, want to just go to bed?

46:06.924 --> 46:07.758
Sure.

46:10.394 --> 46:12.463
I'll be there in a sec.

47:21.898 --> 47:22.733
No.

47:24.201 --> 47:25.036
No!

47:25.869 --> 47:26.703
Stop it!

47:28.205 --> 47:29.540
Joseph, stop it!

47:31.775 --> 47:32.609
No!

47:33.444 --> 47:34.278
No!

47:36.213 --> 47:37.846
Stop it!

47:44.655 --> 47:45.489
No.

47:46.623 --> 47:47.458
No!

47:48.459 --> 47:49.293
No!

47:50.561 --> 47:51.395
Stop!

48:33.937 --> 48:37.672
Hey Melanie, can I
have a word with you?

48:37.674 --> 48:39.341
Yeah, just give me a sec.

50:30.854 --> 50:32.689
Take a seat, please.

50:36.193 --> 50:37.326
What's up?

50:37.328 --> 50:40.897
I'll get to it

50:52.443 --> 50:56.478
But, um, we're gonna
have to lay you off.

50:56.480 --> 50:59.180
We've been really slow
for the last few months.

50:59.182 --> 51:01.983
If you don't mind, just
sign these right here.

51:01.985 --> 51:03.487
Are you serious?

51:06.089 --> 51:08.290
I'm not signing this.

51:08.292 --> 51:11.960
Even if you don't, you
still can't work here anymore.

51:11.962 --> 51:13.962
I'm not signing this!

51:28.245 --> 51:31.813
I will have Mark
escort you out now.

51:31.815 --> 51:33.149
Thank you, Mark.

52:30.273 --> 52:31.540
There's
some breaking news,

52:31.542 --> 52:33.642
reports are coming
in of an attack,

52:33.644 --> 52:37.211
or quite possibly several
attacks, in Paris.

52:37.213 --> 52:40.815
Reports are talking
of a burst of gunfire

52:40.817 --> 52:44.252
at a restaurant in the
10th arrondissement.

52:44.254 --> 52:46.721
Details are still sketchy.

52:46.723 --> 52:51.693
Liberation, the paper, on
Twitter, is talking about

52:51.695 --> 52:54.629
reports of a shooting
at a restaurant.

52:54.631 --> 52:57.832
A journalist from Liberation
who's at the scene,

52:57.834 --> 53:01.770
reporting that several
people have been killed.

53:01.772 --> 53:04.272
He called it a nightmare.

53:04.274 --> 53:07.476
We have no confirmation
at this point.

53:07.478 --> 53:10.979
Police are reported to
be rushing to the scene

53:10.981 --> 53:15.116
near the Place de la Republique
in the 10th arrondissement.

53:15.118 --> 53:17.185
We are trying to get
through to eyewitnesses,

53:17.187 --> 53:20.722
but social media beginning
to report a shooting

53:20.724 --> 53:23.558
at a restaurant in the
10th arrondissement.

53:23.560 --> 53:27.396
Close to the canal, near
the Place de la Republique.

53:27.398 --> 53:31.132
Some reports saying several
people have been killed.

53:31.134 --> 53:34.068
A journalist with
Liberation newspaper

53:34.070 --> 53:37.772
tweeted that the
scene is a nightmare.

53:37.774 --> 53:39.007
We will try and get more on that

53:39.009 --> 53:41.476
with our correspondent in Paris

53:41.478 --> 53:45.248
and indeed on social
media as soon as we can.

53:53.390 --> 53:56.024
Pretty sure that they
have killed Jihadi John,

53:56.026 --> 54:00.094
the man behind the beheading
videos for Islamic State.

54:00.096 --> 54:03.932
Now this happened
in Raqqa, in Syria.

54:03.934 --> 54:08.637
It comes after shootings
in Paris and in France,

54:08.639 --> 54:13.508
actually, in August, and the
shootings of those cartoonists

54:13.510 --> 54:16.545
at the Charlie Hebdo magazine...

54:21.918 --> 54:25.620
Also a shootout in a supermarket,
a Jewish supermarket,

54:25.622 --> 54:27.055
the following day.

54:27.057 --> 54:31.292
We can speak to Gregory Domine,
who joins us on the phone

54:31.294 --> 54:32.395
from Paris...

56:34.417 --> 56:35.919
What time is it?

56:37.120 --> 56:39.153
What time is it?

56:39.155 --> 56:41.022
Shit, I have to go!

56:41.024 --> 56:42.593
My son from school.

56:44.060 --> 56:46.194
I'll call you or text
you or something.

56:46.196 --> 56:47.996
Oh yeah, do that.

58:10.313 --> 58:11.545
A
little later on tonight,

58:11.547 --> 58:13.481
Edmonton is hosting San Jose.

58:13.483 --> 58:17.218
The Habs and the Oilers
in their series...

58:23.293 --> 58:26.094
That is Toronto's tenth
loss against two wins

58:26.096 --> 58:27.696
so far this season.

58:27.698 --> 58:29.664
After the Raptors
dropped the opening game

58:29.666 --> 58:32.600
of their NBA playoff series,
they play the Bucks again

58:32.602 --> 58:34.535
Tuesday night in Toronto.

58:34.537 --> 58:37.438
Atlanta beat Washington today,
Portland topped Golden State,

58:37.440 --> 58:39.808
and Chicago beat Boston tonight.

58:39.810 --> 58:42.643
Sebastian Vettel held off a
late charge from Lewis Hamilton

58:42.645 --> 58:46.149
to win Formula One's
Bahrain Grand Prix...

59:18.849 --> 59:20.982
Hello Ms. Lauzon,
where have you been?

59:20.984 --> 59:23.517
I'm so sorry, I got
caught in traffic.

59:23.519 --> 59:24.753
We were very worried.

59:24.755 --> 59:27.756
We tried to call all
of the numbers on file.

59:27.758 --> 59:29.991
What numbers do
you have on file?

59:29.993 --> 59:32.927
You need to update this
information more frequently.

59:32.929 --> 59:36.064
We also need to talk about
your son's behavior at school.

59:36.066 --> 59:37.531
OK.

59:37.533 --> 59:39.433
We really need to get
going to hockey practice,

59:39.435 --> 59:41.502
or some other sort of sport.

01:00:54.811 --> 01:00:56.344
So a lot of
people don't see the links

01:00:56.346 --> 01:00:59.647
between public transit and
violence against women,

01:00:59.649 --> 01:01:01.682
but they're actually
quite clear.

01:01:01.684 --> 01:01:05.219
Well, I think
because our population is small,

01:01:05.221 --> 01:01:09.023
and even though we're spread
over a large landmass.

01:01:09.025 --> 01:01:13.227
Many people are aware
of their neighbors,

01:01:13.229 --> 01:01:16.831
and they're also very
connected to them through work,

01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:18.532
or they're related to them.

01:01:18.534 --> 01:01:23.237
So everyone potentially ends
up knowing everyone else.

01:01:23.239 --> 01:01:25.273
Why're
you home so late?

01:01:25.275 --> 01:01:27.976
I've had a rough day,
just leave me alone, OK?

01:01:27.978 --> 01:01:29.343
What happened?

01:01:29.345 --> 01:01:31.012
Leave me alone.

01:01:31.014 --> 01:01:33.116
What happened?

01:01:35.818 --> 01:01:37.852
Daddy, can you play now?

01:01:37.854 --> 01:01:41.791
Not now, I'm
talking to your mother.

01:01:43.126 --> 01:01:45.459
Give me my phone.

01:01:45.461 --> 01:01:46.727
Who is this?

01:01:46.729 --> 01:01:48.029
Just
give me my phone.

01:01:48.031 --> 01:01:48.863
Who is this
now, tell who is this.

01:01:48.865 --> 01:01:50.131
No, give it to me.

01:01:50.133 --> 01:01:52.700
Fucking tell me
who is this now!

01:01:52.702 --> 01:01:54.368
Nothing, it's
nothing, it's nobody.

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:56.070
It's nobody, it's nobody?

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.272
You fucking tell me.

01:01:58.274 --> 01:01:59.540
He's nobody, I'll
show you who's nobody.

01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:01.575
No, stop it!

01:02:01.577 --> 01:02:02.977
Stop it!

01:02:02.979 --> 01:02:04.478
Stop!

01:02:10.921 --> 01:02:11.754
Stop it!

01:02:16.026 --> 01:02:17.458
Back off!

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.292
Are you serious now?

01:02:18.294 --> 01:02:19.393
Back the fuck off!

01:02:19.395 --> 01:02:20.897
Are you serious?

01:02:27.203 --> 01:02:30.972
Get out, get
out, get the fuck out.

01:02:30.974 --> 01:02:34.810
I don't care how you go,
just get out of here.

01:02:59.369 --> 01:03:00.136
Mom?

01:03:01.637 --> 01:03:03.171
Can you come?

01:03:03.173 --> 01:03:06.442
Something really
terrible has happened.

01:03:09.179 --> 01:03:13.514
I've been beat up pretty
bad, can you come?

01:03:13.516 --> 01:03:14.350
Thank you.

01:03:30.366 --> 01:03:32.702
We should call the police.

01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:37.273
I can't do that.

01:03:38.408 --> 01:03:41.944
If I find him, I'm
gonna fucking kill him.

01:03:43.246 --> 01:03:45.748
It's not fair, it's not right.

01:03:47.917 --> 01:03:50.518
We're a tight family, I thought.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.852
We know what's going on.

01:03:51.854 --> 01:03:55.089
Your brother's doing
wonderfully well.

01:03:55.091 --> 01:03:59.160
What would make you be
attracted to scum like that?

01:03:59.162 --> 01:04:01.595
Who'd treat you that way?

01:04:01.597 --> 01:04:05.533
What did
we do wrong, Melanie?

01:04:05.535 --> 01:04:09.103
You didn't do anything
wrong, it's not your fault.

01:04:09.105 --> 01:04:12.673
Well we're here
now, let's talk.

01:04:12.675 --> 01:04:14.744
It's too late for that.

01:04:16.646 --> 01:04:19.013
Listen, I'm gonna go
to the hospital, OK?

01:04:19.015 --> 01:04:20.481
We'll take you.

01:04:20.483 --> 01:04:22.316
I've already talked
to you guys about this, OK?

01:04:22.318 --> 01:04:23.784
You just weren't
prepared to listen.

01:04:23.786 --> 01:04:25.119
We've been
listening the whole time.

01:04:25.121 --> 01:04:26.620
Just listen to your heart.

01:04:26.622 --> 01:04:30.624
Everything is there, all of
the answers are in your heart.

01:04:30.626 --> 01:04:32.160
And at some point

01:04:32.162 --> 01:04:36.132
the reaction always seems
to be, just do something.

01:07:29.505 --> 01:07:31.006
Fucking bastard.

01:07:46.989 --> 01:07:48.722
Now here are
the top stories this hour.

01:07:48.724 --> 01:07:50.658
Police investigating
a suspicious package

01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:53.427
found near Broadview and
Gerrard believe it contains...

01:09:35.865 --> 01:09:39.099
I, uh, fell down the steps,
walking into my son's school.

01:09:41.504 --> 01:09:42.772
I brought wine.

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:54.149
Oh, I can do it.

01:10:01.624 --> 01:10:03.559
Yeah, it's my favorite.

01:10:10.032 --> 01:10:13.734
Well, you know, I had to wait
for my parents to come by

01:10:13.736 --> 01:10:15.302
and watch the kid.

01:10:15.304 --> 01:10:17.640
I would have been by sooner.

01:10:26.749 --> 01:10:28.418
You did, didn't you?

01:10:34.023 --> 01:10:34.857
Fuck you!

01:10:57.613 --> 01:11:01.649
Think about what you've done
to me, every fucking day!

01:11:01.651 --> 01:11:03.316
You knew I was a virgin!

01:11:03.318 --> 01:11:06.587
And you took everything anyway!

01:11:06.589 --> 01:11:09.356
I could have made a real
difference in my life.

01:11:09.358 --> 01:11:12.426
But you took it
all fucking away!

01:11:12.428 --> 01:11:13.262
Fuck you!

01:11:14.363 --> 01:11:15.197
Fuck you!

01:11:26.976 --> 01:11:28.310
You took it all.

01:11:30.145 --> 01:11:32.680
You don't fucking care!

01:11:32.682 --> 01:11:33.516
Fuck you!

01:11:40.222 --> 01:11:43.023
You disgust me, you
filthy fucking pig!

01:11:43.025 --> 01:11:43.859
Fucking...

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:01.675
If there is a Hell, I'm gonna
fucking send you there now!

01:12:01.677 --> 01:12:02.678
You hear me!

01:12:03.779 --> 01:12:05.280
Right fucking now!

01:14:54.383 --> 01:14:56.616
Oh, Melanie, you're back.

01:14:56.618 --> 01:14:57.951
Yeah.

01:14:57.953 --> 01:14:59.586
All night?

01:14:59.588 --> 01:15:01.822
You know what
hospitals are like.

01:15:01.824 --> 01:15:02.658
Yeah.

01:15:03.793 --> 01:15:05.092
Where's Dad?

01:15:05.094 --> 01:15:07.194
He had to go to work.

01:15:07.196 --> 01:15:08.130
Are you OK?

01:15:09.098 --> 01:15:12.265
I'm alive, right?

01:15:12.267 --> 01:15:14.902
We did call
the police last night.

01:15:14.904 --> 01:15:16.403
Yeah?

01:15:16.405 --> 01:15:19.072
Yeah and they found him
a couple of blocks away.

01:15:19.074 --> 01:15:20.407
He's in custody?

01:15:20.409 --> 01:15:21.641
Yeah.

01:15:21.643 --> 01:15:24.947
I'm sure he's never
gonna hurt you again.

01:15:25.848 --> 01:15:27.282
Yeah.

01:15:28.483 --> 01:15:30.517
I really hope this is
a wake-up call for you,

01:15:30.519 --> 01:15:32.853
please don't let him
into your home again.

01:15:32.855 --> 01:15:33.689
I won't.

01:15:35.725 --> 01:15:37.657
I made some
coffee, do you want some?

01:15:37.659 --> 01:15:39.161
Yeah, thank you.

01:15:43.966 --> 01:15:46.233
Are we still going
to school today?

01:15:46.235 --> 01:15:47.069
Yeah.

01:15:49.138 --> 01:15:51.206
I want you to bring me.

01:15:52.107 --> 01:15:53.807
Of course.

01:15:53.809 --> 01:15:55.375
But Mommy's in a lot
of pain right now,

01:15:55.377 --> 01:15:57.410
she can't bring you.

01:15:57.412 --> 01:15:59.646
Will a kiss make it better?

01:15:59.648 --> 01:16:02.384
Yeah, that would
help me a lot.

01:16:04.286 --> 01:16:07.022
I promise I'm
gonna be happy too.

01:16:19.735 --> 01:16:20.569
Thank you.

01:16:23.338 --> 01:16:25.238
We better get going to school.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.840
Oh, I can take him.

01:16:26.842 --> 01:16:28.041
Are you sure?

01:16:28.043 --> 01:16:29.144
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:30.045 --> 01:16:30.880
OK.

01:16:33.715 --> 01:16:36.817
I'll wait here till
you get back, OK?

01:16:36.819 --> 01:16:38.518
All right, grab your bag.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.354
OK.

01:16:42.257 --> 01:16:43.492
OK, let's go.
