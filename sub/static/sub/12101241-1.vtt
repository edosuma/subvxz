- We're gonna get him baptized.
- That's cool, man.

when you call him, alright?

02:13.959 --> 02:15.918

02:28.931 --> 02:32.064
and we're still fighting
this war.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.328
Don't know what you want me
to say about that, brother.

02:35.503 --> 02:36.808
Wanna drink this?

02:39.811 --> 02:42.205
Nothing you can say.
It is what it is.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.688
But I appreciate it if you pray
with me tonight, though,

02:46.862 --> 02:48.472
before I go outside the wire.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.605
No, now, we done went down
this rabbit hole

02:50.779 --> 02:52.259

02:52.433 --> 02:53.521
You know I don't subscribe
to the lies

02:53.695 --> 02:55.436
in that book, alright?

02:55.610 --> 02:58.221
Plus, if God did exist,
He don't give a crap about me.

03:03.008 --> 03:07.622
This is, what, your eighth tour
in the last ten years?

03:07.796 --> 03:10.233
You received three purple
hearts, survived two IED attacks

03:10.407 --> 03:13.062
and you still don't believe
that not only does God exist,

03:13.236 --> 03:14.890
but He's got something bigger
in store for your life.

03:15.064 --> 03:17.022
War is my life, brother.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.417
That's what I do.

03:20.591 --> 03:21.810
That's all I know.

I'll really appreciate
the extra coverage tonight.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.260
You know, this, this Bible
belonged to my grandfather.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.090
He gave it to my father
and my father gave it to me

03:41.264 --> 03:42.396
when I was about TJ's age.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.746
And just stop right there.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.704
If I was you, I'd make sure
the lies in that book

03:46.878 --> 03:49.316
don't get spread
throughout my family no more.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.496
You've lost your way, Travis.

03:55.670 --> 03:56.671
And worst part about that
is that

03:56.845 --> 03:59.630
you've lost your faith in God.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.980
Yeah, well...

04:02.154 --> 04:04.244
Did you ever think maybe
your God lost his faith in me?

04:04.418 --> 04:08.248
No! I don't, because He hasn't
and He never will.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.295
Preach, look, man.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.689
My parents spent
their whole lives chasing after

04:14.863 --> 04:18.083
the lies in that book, man,
and look where it got them.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.607
You need to go home, brother.

04:21.304 --> 04:22.827
You need to look
into your parents' accident.

04:23.001 --> 04:26.091
I know it's not gonna be easy,
but you need to move on.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.747
So what, Preach, is that what
your God telling me I should do?

04:29.921 --> 04:30.879
[gunfire]

04:31.053 --> 04:33.185
Your soul is lost, brother.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.145
You're lost.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.408
But it's never too late
to find your way back to God.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.759
The question is,
do you wanna find your way back?

04:42.673 --> 04:45.154
Man...

04:45.328 --> 04:47.635
Don't lose your life
without having your soul ready.

when we're faced with trials?

our trials and our problems

are too big for us to handle
when we have God?

07:03.814 --> 07:05.860

"Behold, I am the Lord,

07:06.034 --> 07:07.165

for Me?"

God tells us to not fear,

In Psalms 55 and 22,

07:20.091 --> 07:23.181
He tells us
to cast our burdens upon Him,

07:23.355 --> 07:26.402
and He will sustain us.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.187
Just because we think
our trials and our problems

07:29.361 --> 07:32.103
are too big for us,
that does not make them

He is our El Shaddai,
our Lord God Almighty!

08:02.220 --> 08:04.701
He is Yahweh.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.487
He is El Olam,
our most high God!

He is Jehovah-Jireh,

08:11.795 --> 08:14.929
He is Jehovah-Rapha,
the Lord that heals.

And I say that if you don't
know Him by any other name,

08:21.457 --> 08:23.851
you can take comfort
in knowing that He is

08:24.025 --> 08:26.810

- It's good to be back.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.836
Just let me know
if you need anything.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.359
- Absolutely.
- Alright.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.187
Pops, Pops, Pops.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.450
- Rangers lead the way, Pops.
- Hoo-ah!

14:02.624 --> 14:04.931
Rangers lead the way! Yes, sir!

14:05.105 --> 14:06.019
[Travis chuckling]

14:11.459 --> 14:15.376
- War hero!
- Oh, man. Sweat Suit Donnie.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.204
- What's up, boy?
- How's it going, brother?

14:17.378 --> 14:18.596
- I'm good.
- When did you get back?

14:18.770 --> 14:20.033
Oh, I just got back yesterday,
man.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.773
Yeah.
How long are you in town for?

14:21.948 --> 14:23.688
- Two, maybe three weeks.
- Alright, listen. Listen.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
I'm late, but you already know
that, alright, but I'mma

14:26.039 --> 14:27.388
pick you up later, we're gonna
go shoot some pool together.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.259
Oh, man,
I can't do it tonight, man.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.435
I'm still tired from this trip,
man. Been in plane all day.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.089
Yeah, alright. Sure. Listen,
why don't you just come back?

14:33.263 --> 14:35.135
Inside for a coffee,
we can have doughnut--

14:35.309 --> 14:37.528
Maybe tomorrow, man, I got
something I gotta look into...

14:37.702 --> 14:39.443
You need some help?
I mean, I can tell Pops to--

14:39.617 --> 14:41.750
Bro! I promise you, I'll catch
up with you, alright?

14:41.924 --> 14:43.230
You late, you need to get in
there, I got something

14:43.404 --> 14:45.058
I gotta do, but we'll hang, man,
for sure.

14:45.232 --> 14:46.146
Alright.

14:48.496 --> 14:51.107
Possum's on the stump
with this one, pastor.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.804
Can it even be repaired?

14:52.979 --> 14:56.286
It can, but not by the boys
in this house.

14:56.460 --> 14:59.202
They about as useful
as a steering wheel on a mule.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.990
Alright, Pedie, just do
what you can to keep it running

15:04.164 --> 15:05.513
until I get something
figured out, alright?

15:05.687 --> 15:08.168
I'll do my best, pastor.
I'll do my best.

15:08.342 --> 15:09.473
I know you will.

15:12.172 --> 15:15.044
[siren blaring]

15:16.437 --> 15:19.092
[instrumental music]

15:20.876 --> 15:24.097
Woman on PA: Paging Dr. Benzer.
Paging Dr. Benzer.

15:28.318 --> 15:31.321
- Travis.
- Hey, Dr. Cunningham.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.280
- Welcome home.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

15:33.454 --> 15:34.542
Thanks for taking the time
to see me.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.239
- What can I do for you?
- Look.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.415
I wanna talk to you
about my parents' accident.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.765
Yes. That's very unfortunate.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.159
I was going through their
belongings and I couldn't find

15:43.333 --> 15:45.205
this necklace
that I made for my mother.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.294
Are you sure she was wearing it
the night of the accident?

15:47.468 --> 15:51.037
Yeah, absolutely.
This is it right here.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.647
I'm just hoping
maybe somebody saw something.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.518
I'm-- I'm sorry.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.607
But I would have definitely
remembered that necklace.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.348
Are you sure?
I mean, you know...

15:58.522 --> 16:00.742
Maybe somebody from the staff,
maybe missed it or--

16:00.916 --> 16:03.701
Travis, all the belongings
that were on your parents

16:03.875 --> 16:06.966
when the paramedics brought them
in were carefully collected

16:07.140 --> 16:09.969
and cataloged and turned over
to the detectives.

16:10.143 --> 16:14.451
I-- I'm sorry, but that necklace
was not one of them.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.977
Woman on PA:
Dr. Cunningham to pharmacy.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.848
Dr. Cunningham to pharmacy.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.850
I've got to run.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.853
- It's good to see you.
- You, too. Thanks again.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.943

[metal clanking]

16:57.929 --> 16:58.887
Pull the gun!

17:01.324 --> 17:02.151
I'm gonna get my team,
we're gonna

17:02.325 --> 17:03.326
come around west, alright?

17:05.111 --> 17:08.027

[gunfire]

17:18.733 --> 17:20.213
[screaming]

17:22.128 --> 17:23.955
Coming down the road
two sniper fire.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.957

Ah!

17:52.636 --> 17:54.856
[indistinct chatter]

17:56.423 --> 17:57.815
Not as good as you could,
you know?

17:57.989 --> 17:59.730
[indistinct chatter]

18:02.646 --> 18:03.995
Who's there?

18:04.170 --> 18:06.650
Good evening, Pops.

18:06.824 --> 18:07.869
What do you want?

18:10.785 --> 18:12.091
It's a nice night.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.571
Pops: Who sent you?

18:14.745 --> 18:17.487
Damon: That's a real nice dress,
Ms. Wanda.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.621
- Go inside, lock the door.
- I will call the police.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.322
[door unlocking]

18:26.496 --> 18:27.802
I don't know what you want,
young man,

18:27.976 --> 18:31.022
but you, you making
a big mistake.

18:34.591 --> 18:38.117
Have a nice night... Pops.

18:47.213 --> 18:51.478
It was good to get that
off my chest. It felt strong.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.393
S-- strong?

18:53.567 --> 18:56.004
You air-force type don't know
anything about strong.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.224
This is army strong right here.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.748
You call that a gun?
This is a real gun.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.880
Courtesy,
United States Marine Corps.

19:03.054 --> 19:06.101
- You're all welcome.
- Here we go.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.930
We gotta listen to this
Marine Corps garbage again.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.324
Well, okay, on that note,

19:11.498 --> 19:14.849
I think that
that is all for now.

19:15.023 --> 19:18.548
You all have
a wonderful evening. Goodnight.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.550
All: Goodnight!

19:20.724 --> 19:23.597
[indistinct chatter]

19:27.340 --> 19:28.950
[sighing]

19:29.124 --> 19:32.258
- Did Pastor Hood stop by?
- He sure did.

19:32.432 --> 19:35.391
Roof's still leaking.
Temperature's still rising.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.001
AC is still broken.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.831
[sighing]
I will talk to him again.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.572
You do that, Ms. Tiffany,

19:42.746 --> 19:44.966
'cause if we don't get somebody
out here that can fix

19:45.140 --> 19:48.361
all these repairs,
especially that AC soon,

19:48.535 --> 19:50.319
it's going to get hotter
than two hamsters

19:50.493 --> 19:53.496
fighting in a wool sack.
Goodnight, doc.

19:57.152 --> 19:59.110
[dramatic music]

20:00.851 --> 20:03.811
[panting] Preach,
I'm taking the platoon now.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.291
I'm taking the platoon now.

20:05.465 --> 20:07.075
Sniper!

20:07.249 --> 20:09.382
Preach, no! No!

20:23.265 --> 20:26.181
[engine revving]

20:40.891 --> 20:43.851
He sent that man to our house.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.766
Poor mother is scared to death.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.638
I'll talk to him.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.162
You need to do
more than just talk.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.602
[sighs] Listen,
you got to fix this

20:55.776 --> 20:58.169
even if it means
telling him everything.

21:13.794 --> 21:16.187
[birds chirping]

21:17.450 --> 21:20.322
[instrumental music]

21:22.759 --> 21:25.632
[machine whirring]

21:29.113 --> 21:32.160
Don't even act like
you don't know what time it is!

21:32.334 --> 21:34.249
[laughing] Look at you, man,
come on.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.382
My brother, man. [laughing]

21:36.556 --> 21:37.426
[Travis laughing]

21:37.600 --> 21:40.951
Oh, man. Hm. Hm.

21:41.125 --> 21:44.085
Remember when we were little,
we used to make my parents stop

21:44.259 --> 21:45.565
every time
we saw a doughnut shop?

21:45.739 --> 21:46.914
I remember
you used to make them stop,

21:47.088 --> 21:48.481
I didn't used to make them stop.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.700
- Oh! So you complaining?
- No, you don't.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.398
[Donnie laughing]

21:52.572 --> 21:54.225
I still see you trying to be
of service

21:54.400 --> 21:56.750
and act like
you know how to fix stuff.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.491
I could use some help.
You wanna pick up a tool?

21:58.665 --> 22:02.712
Nope. No. I'll leave the manual
labor to you and dad.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.498
All that Rangers lead the way
and hoo-ah stuff,

22:05.672 --> 22:09.328
I'm like, "Rangers lead the way,
to where? Wh-- what's a hoo-ah?"

22:09.502 --> 22:11.547
I'mma have to school you
about that, man.

22:11.721 --> 22:14.681
- Man, good old times, man.
Travis: Yes, sir.

22:14.855 --> 22:17.336
I still remember your parents,
man.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.425
They didn't deserve to go
the way they did.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.557
Don't be sorry about it, man.

22:21.731 --> 22:24.908
Accidents happen
to good people, too.

22:25.082 --> 22:27.650
Speaking of good people,

22:27.824 --> 22:29.304
Pops looked a little rattled
yesterday, man.

22:29.478 --> 22:31.828
Everything alright in the shop?

22:32.002 --> 22:33.264
Cool as can be.

22:35.266 --> 22:37.225
Everything's cool, man.
I promise.

22:37.399 --> 22:38.400
Alright.

22:41.055 --> 22:43.362
I went to talk to Dr. Cunningham
yesterday.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.451
Donnie: And what's up?

22:45.625 --> 22:47.757
Man, it's this accident,

22:47.931 --> 22:50.804
look, none of them makes sense
to me, man. Never has.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.936
What do you mean?

22:53.110 --> 22:54.764
Donnie, my father would not have
just accelerated

22:54.938 --> 22:56.679
into a parked truck, man,

22:56.853 --> 23:00.030
unless somebody or someone or
something made him do that, man,

23:00.204 --> 23:01.902
caused him to react that way.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.078
Look, man, it was a ugly night
that night, Travis. Okay?

23:04.252 --> 23:06.863
There was a bad storm,
roads was wet, slick.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.387
Look, but you know my old man.

23:08.561 --> 23:09.823
I mean, that would have made him
more alert, man.

23:09.997 --> 23:11.302
He would have been sharp.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.087
I'm telling you,
all these slick roads

23:13.261 --> 23:17.526
and bad-night stuff people
keep saying, I ain't buying it.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.529
I think something else
was the cause.

23:20.703 --> 23:21.965
What do you think happened?

23:23.227 --> 23:25.534
You know what? I don't know.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.667
But I promise you,
I'm gonna find out.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.626
And when I do...

23:35.892 --> 23:37.024
Come on, man.

23:38.155 --> 23:41.071
[engine revving]

23:48.470 --> 23:51.386
[instrumental music]

24:15.192 --> 24:17.804
We've identified
three more homeless vets,

24:17.978 --> 24:19.414
but we can't bring them
into the center

24:19.588 --> 24:21.111
until the repairs are done.

24:21.285 --> 24:23.287
[sighs] We only have half
of what we need

24:23.462 --> 24:25.072
for all the repairs,

24:25.246 --> 24:28.379
and that's not even enough
to fix or replace the AC.

24:28.554 --> 24:31.470
- We have to do something.
- I know.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.040
Hood: Hey.
- Huh?

24:37.214 --> 24:40.479
What if we are supposed to get
another soldier to help us?

24:40.653 --> 24:42.872
I heard that Matthew Fox's son
is in town.

24:43.046 --> 24:46.180
And if I remember correctly, he
could fix just about anything.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.487
Well, do you think
he will help us?

24:48.661 --> 24:51.664
There's only one way
to find out. Let's go.

24:51.838 --> 24:52.752
Okay.

24:56.712 --> 24:59.193
[hammering]

24:59.367 --> 25:01.238
Hood: What did I tell you?
Tiffany: Heh-heh.

25:01.412 --> 25:02.762
Hood: Travis!

25:04.024 --> 25:04.938
Hello!

25:06.766 --> 25:08.637
- How you doing, pastor?
Hood: Doing good.

25:08.811 --> 25:11.161
It's good to see you here safe
and in good health.

25:11.335 --> 25:12.815
To God be all the glory.

25:14.774 --> 25:16.602
Let me tell you something,
I really,

25:16.776 --> 25:18.865
really miss your mom and dad.

25:19.039 --> 25:20.780
They were fine, fine people.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.610
Travis,
this is Tiffany Robinson.

25:24.784 --> 25:27.047
She heads up our new
Veterans Center Ministry.

25:27.221 --> 25:29.049
Hi.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.225
What can I do for you, pastor?

25:31.399 --> 25:34.315
Well, it's the veteran's center
building.

25:34.489 --> 25:37.797
- It's in pretty bad shape.
- It's in horrible shape.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.712
[laughing]

25:39.886 --> 25:41.278
She's right.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.324
Travis, we need someone
with your skills

25:43.498 --> 25:45.108
who can come in and help us
renovate this place,

25:45.282 --> 25:47.502
so that we can open our doors
for veterans like you

25:47.676 --> 25:49.939
who need our help.

25:50.113 --> 25:51.767
Do I look like I need your help?

25:55.118 --> 25:56.293
I didn't quite mean it
like that--

25:56.467 --> 25:58.687
Can't do it, alright?

25:58.861 --> 26:00.341
I got a lot of work
to get done here.

26:00.515 --> 26:01.429
Plus, there's something
I need to check into

26:01.603 --> 26:03.518
before I report back, so...

26:03.692 --> 26:06.129
[sighing] I'm sorry, alright?

26:06.303 --> 26:08.044
I'm sorry you had to come all
the way out here for nothing.

26:08.218 --> 26:10.264
So, so that's it?

26:10.438 --> 26:12.701
You're gonna turn your back
on us just like that?

26:12.875 --> 26:13.833
Yeah.

26:14.007 --> 26:14.877
Is it that easy for you

26:15.051 --> 26:16.618
to turn your back on God?

26:19.273 --> 26:20.535
[intense music]

26:20.709 --> 26:23.103
Turn my back on God?

26:23.277 --> 26:26.106
You cannot be serious right now,
'cause the way I see it,

26:26.280 --> 26:27.977
God turned his back on me
a long time ago!

26:28.151 --> 26:29.849
That is not true, Travis.
God loves you.

26:30.023 --> 26:32.808
He loves me? Just what exactly
has God done for me?

26:32.982 --> 26:36.116
More than any of us can even
imagine, not the least of which

26:36.290 --> 26:38.118
was dying for your sins
and answering your prayers.

26:38.292 --> 26:41.077
My prayers. Y'all always talking
about prayers.

26:41.251 --> 26:44.385
You know who else pray?
Enemy soldiers.

26:44.559 --> 26:48.128
Enemy soldiers pray
all the time, 10-20 times a day.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.565
But do you know what they do
when they finish praying?

26:50.739 --> 26:52.698
Do you?

26:52.872 --> 26:56.266
They strap on explosives
and they kill Americans!

26:56.440 --> 26:57.572
My friends!

26:57.746 --> 26:58.617
And for what?

26:58.791 --> 27:00.793
Some stupid religion?

27:00.967 --> 27:03.143
But that's,
that's not God's work.

27:03.317 --> 27:05.885
No? It ain't God's work,
then whose is it?

27:06.059 --> 27:07.800
What? Satan's?

27:07.974 --> 27:09.410
Oh, so what, God's taken
a coffee break now, alright?

27:09.584 --> 27:11.325
- He ain't calling the shots?
- Travis.

27:11.499 --> 27:15.024
Regardless of the circumstances,
God still loves you.

27:15.198 --> 27:16.809
- He loves me.
- He loves us all.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.985
"He loves us all?
He loves me. He loves us all!"

27:19.159 --> 27:20.987
What about
Staff Sergeant Pearson, huh?

27:21.161 --> 27:22.728
An IED ripped through
his vehicle

27:22.902 --> 27:24.730
and ripped him into pieces!

27:24.904 --> 27:27.863
Or what about Corporal Wilson?
Must've really loved him.

27:28.037 --> 27:31.258
Sniper bullet nearly took
half his head off.

27:31.432 --> 27:33.652
And I guess God really loved
Preach, He got a funny way

27:33.826 --> 27:35.697
of showing love to Preach
'cause He let a 500-pound

27:35.871 --> 27:38.569
roadside bomb
tear him to pieces,

27:38.744 --> 27:40.441
cut his whole platoon down!

27:42.051 --> 27:43.705
Or what about my mom
and my daddy?

27:46.665 --> 27:49.624
God can help you, Travis.

27:49.798 --> 27:52.322
I don't need your help,
I don't need your help,

27:52.496 --> 27:54.890
and I definitely don't need His.

27:55.064 --> 27:58.807
What I need is for you and you
to get off my property, now.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.113
Just go.

28:05.466 --> 28:06.510
You're gonna find
your way back to God.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.730
I said, get off!

28:08.904 --> 28:11.341
Pastor, it's time for us to go.
It's time to go.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.128
Come on, pastor.

28:20.437 --> 28:23.136
[gunfire]

28:23.310 --> 28:25.007
- What we got?
- Coming down the road!

28:25.181 --> 28:27.270
Two sniper fire
and then a guy down over there!

28:27.444 --> 28:28.924
Alright, copy that, copy that!

28:29.098 --> 28:31.448
I'mma grab my team!
We're gonna go on rounds!

28:31.622 --> 28:33.276
- Hey, come with us, okay?
- Okay.

28:44.897 --> 28:46.159
Really appreciate it if you
pray with me tonight, though,

28:46.333 --> 28:47.856
before I go outside the wire.

28:48.030 --> 28:49.597
I could really use
your extra coverage tonight.

28:49.771 --> 28:50.685
Ain't gonna happen, Preach.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.291
God don't love me, Preach.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.643
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

29:35.817 --> 29:37.384
'Cause I could have done
something.

29:39.299 --> 29:40.866
I should have talked to Ranger 6
into letting your platoon

29:41.040 --> 29:42.693
out that night.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.783
And you would be dead now
instead of me.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.005
I don't know what to do, Preach.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.572
You can always go to God.

29:53.443 --> 29:55.358
God can't save me, man.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.318
God is our rescuer, Travis.

29:58.492 --> 30:01.712
He's granted us eternal life.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.453
But we can't allow our sins
to keep us from Him,

30:03.627 --> 30:05.891
'cause if we do,
it causes Him to reject us

30:06.065 --> 30:07.893
and not listen to our prayers.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.764
But I shouldn't even
be here, man.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.593
I should be over there.

30:12.767 --> 30:15.422
I should be helping
our brothers.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.685
In fact, why am I still alive
and you're not?

30:19.905 --> 30:22.385
You're still alive
because God has a plan for you.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.433
There's something important
you still have to do.

30:28.043 --> 30:31.133
Preach, what's that even mean,
man? Uh...

30:31.307 --> 30:33.048
[sobbing]

30:33.222 --> 30:34.745
Preach: Stay alert, Travis.

30:40.577 --> 30:41.796
Stay alive.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.321
Stay alive.

30:47.193 --> 30:49.238

30:59.901 --> 31:01.468
Just got a little winded,
alright?

31:01.642 --> 31:06.212
- Sir, can we see some ID?
- I was jogging, alright?

31:06.386 --> 31:08.518
I ain't got no ID. I ain't doing
nothing, I'm just--

31:08.692 --> 31:12.566
Sir, get your hands out of your
pocket and get on the ground.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.960
I was just jogging.
Why are you all on me?

31:15.134 --> 31:16.744
Sir, get your hands
out of your pocket

31:16.918 --> 31:18.746
and get on the ground now!

31:18.920 --> 31:21.575
We don't need all of that, man.
I ain't getting on no ground!

31:21.749 --> 31:24.447
Man 2: I told you to get on--
- I ain't getting on no ground!

the first time, alright?

32:15.846 --> 32:18.023
I don't need your help.

32:18.197 --> 32:20.373
Pastor Hood felt bad
about what happened yesterday.

32:20.547 --> 32:22.288
He feels like we may have
blindsided you,

32:22.462 --> 32:23.767
whatever that means.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.378
So when he found out
you were arrested,

32:25.552 --> 32:27.554
he took the money
that the church had raised to--

32:27.728 --> 32:29.817
Tell him I'll pay him back,
alright?

32:29.991 --> 32:31.862
But I'm not working
on your center.

you have going on, okay?

32:41.785 --> 32:44.005
Here, you need it.

32:44.179 --> 32:46.268

I wanna show you.

tough as nails,

33:18.692 --> 33:20.476
they served their country.

33:21.912 --> 33:25.351
And now they're homeless
and troubled.

33:25.525 --> 33:27.266
That's not the military's fault,
Tiffany.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.050
And I never said that it was.

33:29.224 --> 33:31.792
But it doesn't change the fact
that these men

33:31.966 --> 33:35.056
fought for their country,
and now look at them,

33:35.230 --> 33:37.363
sitting over there, hungry,

33:37.537 --> 33:40.061
having no clue where
their next meal will come from.

at the time of the accident
either,

the same time as the accident,

37:46.481 --> 37:48.266

in some of those buildings.

over some of the shops,

38:38.794 --> 38:41.014
Second Timothy 2 and 1 tells us

38:41.188 --> 38:43.756
that we must be strong
in the grace

38:43.930 --> 38:46.802
that is in Christ Jesus.

38:46.976 --> 38:49.675
Not be strong in His grace
in the worst of times.

38:52.112 --> 38:54.244
If we claim to be strong
in faith

38:54.419 --> 38:57.770
and know that we are stronger
than others,

38:57.944 --> 38:59.989
I ask you, what should we do?

39:00.163 --> 39:02.949
Should we bear
with the failings of the weak?

39:03.123 --> 39:06.692
Should we bear with those
who are troubled and alone?

39:09.303 --> 39:12.132
Do you, who are strong
in your walk with God,

39:12.306 --> 39:16.179
know that He wants us to work
endlessly, exhaustively,

39:16.354 --> 39:19.400
to help those that are in need
of finding their way to Him?

39:19.574 --> 39:22.185
Carry each other's burdens,

39:22.360 --> 39:25.319
and in this way we will fulfill
the law of Christ.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.497
The Bible says
that no one can come to me

39:29.671 --> 39:32.935
unless the one who sent me
brings you and leads you.

39:33.109 --> 39:36.374
He says, "All that seeks Him
will find Him."

39:38.506 --> 39:42.336
But we that seek Him must seek
Him for the right reasons.

39:44.077 --> 39:46.340
Right?

39:46.514 --> 39:49.996
We must not seek Him just
for forgiveness of our sins.

39:50.170 --> 39:53.216
We must seek Him
by seeking His presence.

39:53.391 --> 39:56.437
For whoever conceals
his transgressions

39:56.611 --> 39:59.397
will not prosper.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.529
But he who walks away from them

40:01.703 --> 40:04.576
will obtain
His grace and mercy.

40:05.925 --> 40:07.666
Amen.

40:07.840 --> 40:08.928
Thank you, Jesus.

40:10.582 --> 40:12.235
[chuckling]

40:12.410 --> 40:16.370
It is time for a break.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.851
Oh, it's cool. Thank you.

40:19.025 --> 40:22.028
- You are very, very welcome.
- Appreciate it.

40:23.246 --> 40:24.683
Mm...

40:26.032 --> 40:27.599
So what's your story?

40:28.600 --> 40:30.819
What do you mean?

40:30.993 --> 40:34.867
You know, how does a doctor
go to selling insurance?

40:35.041 --> 40:37.130
Um, I'm still a doctor

40:37.304 --> 40:41.961
and I do a lot more
than just sell insurance.

40:42.135 --> 40:44.442
But that's another story
for another day.

40:44.616 --> 40:47.140
- How are the repairs coming?
- It's good. It's good.

40:47.314 --> 40:49.142
The parts for the AC came in.

40:49.316 --> 40:51.057
- I'll put 'em on later and...
Tiffany: Okay.

40:51.231 --> 40:52.667
That's pretty much
all I can do until

40:52.841 --> 40:54.495
the church can get
the rest of the supplies.

40:54.669 --> 40:57.629
Great, so I can tell Pastor Hood
that the three homeless vets

40:57.803 --> 40:59.413
can move in
at the end of the week?

40:59.587 --> 41:01.807
- Yeah.
- Good.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.896
What about the money
for the other repairs?

41:04.070 --> 41:07.334
Oh, I'm working on a plan.
[chuckles]

41:09.554 --> 41:11.469
You know, um,

41:11.643 --> 41:15.124
the guys are really gonna miss
having you around here.

41:16.256 --> 41:17.475
They have you.

41:19.955 --> 41:22.610
[sighs] You know,

41:22.784 --> 41:27.093
I heard that army men
really like coffee.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.965
Really? That line again?

41:30.139 --> 41:32.794
I mean, it worked
the first time, didn't it?

41:32.968 --> 41:35.710
So are you gonna join me
for a cup of coffee later?

41:37.886 --> 41:39.975
Yeah, sure. Why not?

41:40.149 --> 41:41.890
But this time
I get to pick the place.

41:42.064 --> 41:43.022
Done.

41:46.547 --> 41:47.417
[Tiffany laughing]

41:47.592 --> 41:49.202
[Travis laughing]

41:49.376 --> 41:52.466
Well, no one told me the
beautiful Dr. Tiffany was here.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.337
Oh. Hey, Pops.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.948
Well, you never told me
you knew Pops.

41:56.122 --> 41:58.385
Um, everybody knows Pops
in this town.

41:58.559 --> 42:01.127
Plus, he comes down
to the center and brings coffee

42:01.301 --> 42:04.304
and pastries for the veterans
every Wednesday.

42:04.478 --> 42:08.047
Hm. It's fine work you're doing
with those boys, Dr. Tiffany.

42:08.221 --> 42:10.745
- Godly work.
Tiffany: Thank you.

42:10.919 --> 42:14.444
I ran into Dr. Cunningham,
she said you paid her a visit.

42:14.619 --> 42:17.056
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

42:17.230 --> 42:20.929
I was just checking on something
that belonged to my mother.

42:21.103 --> 42:23.715
What's up, man? I've been
looking all over for you.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.499
You don't answer your phone.
How's it going, Pops?

42:25.673 --> 42:27.022
- Hey.
- Hey, Donnie.

42:27.196 --> 42:29.198
- How are you, Tiff?
- Uh-uh, no, you don't.

42:29.372 --> 42:31.592
We have to get ready
to close up for the night.

42:31.766 --> 42:33.638
Doctor, I'll see you Wednesday,
Travis, I'll see you

42:33.812 --> 42:35.509
when I see you. Donnie, come on.

42:35.683 --> 42:37.729
I wanna get home
at a reasonable hour.

42:37.903 --> 42:39.295
Later, Pops.

42:39.469 --> 42:41.341
Hey, man.
I wanna shoot some pool.

42:41.515 --> 42:43.604
You feel like losing some of
that piggy bank money of yours?

42:43.778 --> 42:48.043
Oh, man. I'm tired, brother.
I don't know about tonight, man.

42:48.217 --> 42:50.480
Donnie: Come on, man. You know
a little fun never crush you.

42:50.655 --> 42:52.700
That's what I've been trying
to tell him.

42:52.874 --> 42:54.223
Donnie: Come on!

42:56.095 --> 42:58.271
Alright, brother, I'll meet you
down there at 1900.

42:58.445 --> 43:01.448
Alright. Okay, wait, 1900,
that's 12, 7 p.m.!

43:01.622 --> 43:02.884
Got it. Alright, alright.

43:03.058 --> 43:05.017
- Hey, Donnie.
Donnie: Hey.

43:05.191 --> 43:06.279
Hey, did you ever help
Pops take care of my

43:06.453 --> 43:07.454
parents' place while I was gone?

43:07.628 --> 43:09.195
Yeah. A few times. Why?

43:09.369 --> 43:10.979
Did you ever see this necklace,

43:11.153 --> 43:13.460
this burgundy surrounded
by white gold on all sides?

43:13.634 --> 43:16.506
Ah, nope.
Never seen any necklaces.

43:16.681 --> 43:19.031
- Sorry.
Travis: Alright, man.

43:19.205 --> 43:21.250
Why are you looking
for your mom's necklace?

43:21.424 --> 43:23.470
I gave it to her
right before the accident.

43:23.644 --> 43:25.211
She said she'd never
take it off until

43:25.385 --> 43:27.735
either the war was over
or I never had to go back

43:27.909 --> 43:31.260
and fight no more.
But I can't find it anywhere.

43:31.434 --> 43:35.090
Uh-huh! That's why you were
at the coroner's office.

43:35.264 --> 43:37.745
And the police department,
the fire department,

43:37.919 --> 43:40.618
the ambulance drivers, both of
them, I talked to them, nothing.

43:40.792 --> 43:43.142
Go back to the street,
the apartments, the folks

43:43.316 --> 43:45.971
who live in them above, like
the shops over there, nothing.

43:46.145 --> 43:47.973
Nobody knows anything about it.

43:48.147 --> 43:50.149
Well,
maybe she wasn't wearing it.

43:50.323 --> 43:54.153
Then it would be at the house
somewhere, or her room.

43:54.327 --> 43:57.373
No, I'm pretty sure
she was wearing it.

43:57.547 --> 44:00.028
So, like, you're answering
my question or what?

44:00.202 --> 44:03.118
Okay, okay, so I got my PhD
in clinical psychology

44:03.292 --> 44:05.773
and I had my own practice
for three years,

44:05.947 --> 44:07.862
then, you know,
it just wasn't enough.

44:08.036 --> 44:10.299
So I moved in
to financial planning,

44:10.473 --> 44:11.692
and I never looked back.

44:11.866 --> 44:13.041
And what about the stuff you do

44:13.215 --> 44:14.695
at the center
and at the church?

44:14.869 --> 44:17.132
Well, God has always been
a huge part of my life.

44:17.306 --> 44:18.830
That's how I've made it
this far,

44:19.004 --> 44:22.616
through prayer and His mercy
and His grace, you know?

44:22.790 --> 44:26.489
And the PhD allows me to do
what I love with the guys

44:26.664 --> 44:31.277
at the center, so I have
the best of both worlds.

44:31.451 --> 44:32.626
Okay.

44:34.454 --> 44:35.673
You know...

44:37.326 --> 44:38.937
this is my first date

44:39.111 --> 44:41.287
since moving to town.

44:41.461 --> 44:42.941
This was a date?

44:44.682 --> 44:46.771
- Ha-ha-ha...
- Okay.

44:46.945 --> 44:48.337
Do you remember when I said

44:48.511 --> 44:51.514
the guys at the center
are gonna miss you?

44:51.689 --> 44:54.169
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna miss you, too.

44:56.084 --> 44:58.608
So I have to go grocery shopping
tomorrow.

44:58.783 --> 45:02.395
We need a few things for the
center. Do you wanna come with?

45:05.180 --> 45:07.095
Why not?

45:07.269 --> 45:08.618
- That's another date, huh?
- Yeah.

45:08.793 --> 45:10.708
[both laughing]

45:13.580 --> 45:15.582
See you tomorrow?

45:15.756 --> 45:16.844
- Okay.
- Yup.

45:18.106 --> 45:19.629
[chuckling]

45:19.804 --> 45:21.283
[indistinct chatter]

45:21.457 --> 45:23.155
Boom. Hoo-ah.

45:23.329 --> 45:24.809
If I didn't know any better,
I think you hustled me.

45:24.983 --> 45:26.898
Hoo-ah. [laughing]

45:27.072 --> 45:28.290
Remember, you asked for this,
boy.

45:28.464 --> 45:29.422
Listen, we'll rack them again,
man.

45:29.596 --> 45:32.338
I'm not gonna lose six in a row.

45:32.512 --> 45:34.079
Well, you lost that one.
You rack.

45:34.253 --> 45:36.037
I gotta take a head call.

45:36.211 --> 45:38.953
Lose your rack,
you lose your rack.

45:44.916 --> 45:47.483
- This clown, man.
- Right.

45:49.529 --> 45:51.400
[intense music]

45:51.574 --> 45:52.706
Get the money.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.664
- Let me go check him.
- Yup.

45:56.188 --> 45:57.493
You know what it is.

45:59.321 --> 46:02.281
Suit, Suit, Suit.

46:04.283 --> 46:08.243
It must be a recess time
or something.

46:08.417 --> 46:11.159
- What's going on, Big Six?
- My money, Donnie.

46:11.333 --> 46:13.858
That's what's up.
Where that, though?

46:14.032 --> 46:16.034
I mean, you here playing games,
so that means you must have it.

46:16.208 --> 46:17.992
- Right?
- Look, believe what you want.

46:18.166 --> 46:20.255
Okay, I'll get your money.
I said I will, okay?

46:20.429 --> 46:22.301
First off,
watch how you talk to me.

46:22.475 --> 46:24.782
Secondly, I know you gonna
get it, because if you don't...

46:24.956 --> 46:27.393
- You already know what's gon--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:27.567 --> 46:29.612
Everything good in here, man?

46:29.787 --> 46:31.005
Who is you?

46:31.963 --> 46:33.181
Who are you?

46:35.314 --> 46:36.750
Is this your man?

46:37.882 --> 46:40.362
[laughing] Oh, okay.

46:42.538 --> 46:45.324
War hero, in the flesh.

46:47.456 --> 46:48.893
Do you know who I am?

46:50.242 --> 46:51.460
Should I care?

46:52.984 --> 46:54.855
Okay.

46:55.029 --> 46:58.250
Heard a lot of things
about you, army boy.

46:58.424 --> 47:00.078
Heard you got skills.

47:00.252 --> 47:02.558
You capable of handling yourself
real well.

47:04.647 --> 47:06.258
Put your quarter
on the table, man.

47:06.432 --> 47:08.303
I'll show you how capable I am.

47:10.044 --> 47:11.916
Do I look like I play games,
son?

47:13.395 --> 47:15.310
Look right here, man.

47:15.484 --> 47:17.747
I'm the big dawg
in this town now.

47:17.922 --> 47:19.097
You might need to know that
for the future

47:19.271 --> 47:21.882
and for your personal safety,

47:22.056 --> 47:23.666
if you know what I mean.

47:23.841 --> 47:26.408
- The big dawg.
- Yeah.

47:26.582 --> 47:28.715
Yeah. Alright, ladies,
the door is that way.

47:28.889 --> 47:31.022
- Come on, man.
- Ha-ha-ha...

47:31.196 --> 47:35.069
Army boy got a set on him.
I like that.

47:35.243 --> 47:36.375
Respect.

47:37.289 --> 47:39.160
I'm impressed.

47:39.334 --> 47:41.684
Takes a lot to impress me,
Donnie, I'll tell you that.

47:44.122 --> 47:45.775
Look, man,
maybe we can use somebody

47:45.950 --> 47:49.040
with your special skill set,
uh, down in my organization.

47:49.214 --> 47:52.043
- Not interested.
- You need to be.

47:53.914 --> 47:55.742
Okay. Well, well, what's that?

47:55.916 --> 47:58.310
Oh, you tough now, huh?

47:58.484 --> 48:00.138
See, that's the problem
nowadays.

48:00.312 --> 48:02.140
Any idiot,
no matter how stupid they are,

48:02.314 --> 48:04.359
can get their hands on a gun.

48:04.533 --> 48:05.839
You wanna walk around
like you the tough guy

48:06.013 --> 48:08.102
on the block.

48:08.276 --> 48:10.496
But you wanna impress me,

48:10.670 --> 48:13.064
raise your right hand,
say I do,

48:13.238 --> 48:15.066
strap on the uniform,

48:15.240 --> 48:16.676
then head down range
to face the enemy

48:16.850 --> 48:19.200
that lives to only kill
or capture you

48:19.374 --> 48:21.811
and parades your final moments
on camera...

48:23.117 --> 48:24.945
for the whole world to see.

48:27.295 --> 48:30.603
Look, I've been living dead
for the last 12 years.

48:30.777 --> 48:32.431
No reason to live another day
if you think your boy here

48:32.605 --> 48:34.302
can end my misery.

48:34.476 --> 48:37.262
You think you can do that,
big guy?

48:37.436 --> 48:40.743
I'mma give you a try.
You got one time.

48:40.918 --> 48:43.485
If you think you can get that
gun before I take it from you

48:43.659 --> 48:44.791
and shove it down your throat--

48:44.965 --> 48:47.489
Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on, D.

48:47.663 --> 48:50.101
We don't wanna smoke while
all these people are here, man.

48:50.275 --> 48:52.799
That's what I thought.

48:52.973 --> 48:57.717
Now, if you girls will excuse
us, we gonna finish our game.

48:57.891 --> 48:58.936
[laughing]

49:00.763 --> 49:02.243
Okay.

49:02.417 --> 49:04.985
Alright, I like that.
I like that, army boy.

49:05.159 --> 49:08.206
Look at here,
you have a change of heart,

49:08.380 --> 49:09.903
you wanna put those skills
of yours to use,

49:10.077 --> 49:13.689
earn some real money,
you come hollering at me.

49:13.863 --> 49:17.476
I ain't hard to find.
I eat lunches here every day.

49:17.650 --> 49:20.000
I know they don't open at 4:00,
but they do a special

49:20.174 --> 49:21.915
private lunch for me.

49:22.089 --> 49:24.439
And it's all free.

49:24.613 --> 49:25.745
You know what I'm saying?

49:25.919 --> 49:27.138
So you come see me
just to show you

49:27.312 --> 49:30.619
there ain't no... love lost,
alright?

49:30.793 --> 49:32.143
Are we done?

49:33.057 --> 49:34.797
Yeah, for now.

49:36.799 --> 49:38.410
Have my money, Donnie.

49:40.020 --> 49:41.674
See you later, army boy.

49:48.811 --> 49:53.164
You got yourself into something
we need to talk about, Donnie?

49:53.338 --> 49:56.297
No, not at all, man.
Let's just, uh, let's just play.

50:00.127 --> 50:01.172
Travis: Why is it so hot
out here, man?

50:01.346 --> 50:03.652
Tiffany: I know.
Oh, my goodness.

50:03.826 --> 50:05.263
Travis: Ah, you picked
the hottest day of the year

50:05.437 --> 50:08.527
to go shopping.
Sweating through my shirt.

50:11.182 --> 50:13.706
Oh. Hoo!

50:13.880 --> 50:15.708
Okay, I hope
I didn't forget anything.

50:15.882 --> 50:17.666
Seriously?
You bought the whole store.

50:17.840 --> 50:19.320
I don't think
you forgot nothing.

50:19.494 --> 50:21.148
Oh, did I get
Marine Corp Bob's peanuts?

50:21.322 --> 50:22.845
Because he loves it.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.196
Peanuts! Oh.
And then what about the--

50:25.370 --> 50:26.371
[dramatic music]

50:26.545 --> 50:27.589
Oh, oh.

50:28.895 --> 50:30.984
Travis?

50:31.158 --> 50:32.029
[baby bawling]

50:32.203 --> 50:33.639
Shut that baby up!

50:35.162 --> 50:36.381
Somebody shut that baby up,

50:36.555 --> 50:37.512
it's gonna give away
our position!

50:37.686 --> 50:38.557
Okay, listen, Travis. Travis.

50:38.731 --> 50:39.688
Travis, listen to me.

50:39.862 --> 50:41.386
There is no, there's no baby.

50:41.560 --> 50:43.040
- There's no baby.
- Get away from me!

50:43.214 --> 50:45.390
Okay, listen, let me help you.

50:45.564 --> 50:47.087
- I don't need nobody's help!
- Okay, listen.

50:47.261 --> 50:49.698
At least, if you won't let me
help you, Travis,

50:49.872 --> 50:51.787
please, let God help you!

50:51.961 --> 50:54.964
Go talk to Pastor Hood because
you cannot do this by yourself.

50:55.139 --> 50:56.488
And if you try,
you are gonna die,

50:56.662 --> 50:57.967
and I cannot let that happen.

50:58.142 --> 50:59.012
Just stay away from me, alright?

50:59.186 --> 51:00.448
Just stay away from me.

51:00.622 --> 51:02.320
- Travis?
- Just stay away from me.

51:04.539 --> 51:07.368
Preach: Travis.
Travis, help me.

51:09.153 --> 51:11.068
Please help me. Travis!

51:11.242 --> 51:14.114
[ominous music]

51:17.944 --> 51:18.901
This is all your fault.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.468
Oh, no!

51:26.257 --> 51:27.736
Come on, man.

51:29.260 --> 51:32.132
[sobbing]

51:36.789 --> 51:38.834
[rain pattering]

51:39.008 --> 51:41.924
[thunder rumbling]

51:48.496 --> 51:51.151
[thunder rumbling]

51:53.762 --> 51:56.635
[instrumental music]

51:58.245 --> 51:59.638
Who's there?

52:03.337 --> 52:05.122
Who's... Travis?

52:07.211 --> 52:08.734
Travis, is that you?

52:12.172 --> 52:14.043
[thunder rumbling]

52:14.218 --> 52:15.915
Here you go, bud.

52:16.089 --> 52:18.613
[sniffles] Thank you.

52:26.926 --> 52:28.797
So what were you doing
out there?

52:32.714 --> 52:34.673
Just considering my options.

52:37.589 --> 52:38.894
What does that mean?

52:40.940 --> 52:42.376
I came here tonight...

52:44.117 --> 52:46.163
'cause I can't live with myself
anymore.

52:48.687 --> 52:50.297
Of what I've become.

52:52.343 --> 52:54.823
- Travis, I know it seems--
- No, pastor, please.

52:55.868 --> 52:57.217
Let me finish.

53:01.569 --> 53:03.789
You know, people think
we keep going back

53:03.963 --> 53:07.967
because we need the adrenaline
and we like killing.

53:10.056 --> 53:11.492
None of that's true.

53:14.060 --> 53:15.931
You know why we keep going back?

53:17.585 --> 53:19.065
Tell me, son.

53:21.415 --> 53:24.418
We go back so we can keep
our brothers and sisters alive.

53:25.724 --> 53:27.726
That's why.

53:27.900 --> 53:31.164
Just the thought
that they are over there

53:31.338 --> 53:33.210
in the, in the fight
without you...

53:34.820 --> 53:36.691
that eats at your soul.

53:39.607 --> 53:41.130
Travis: Now, you start
believing you're the only ones

53:41.305 --> 53:43.132
that can keep them alive.

53:43.307 --> 53:44.830
But then you find out
that that's not true either

53:45.004 --> 53:47.485
because they still die,

53:47.659 --> 53:49.356
just like my friend Preach.

53:50.966 --> 53:52.490
His last mission...

53:57.495 --> 53:59.018
It was hot outside the wire
that night.

53:59.192 --> 54:00.802
[gunfire]

54:00.976 --> 54:02.848
Preach was scared, man.

54:05.546 --> 54:07.548
I've never seen him so afraid.

54:10.421 --> 54:12.336
So he asked me to pray with him.

54:14.076 --> 54:16.122
That's all he wanted.

54:16.296 --> 54:19.343
But I didn't. I didn't do it.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.172
I wouldn't.

54:23.347 --> 54:26.567
That's all that man wanted
was for me to pray with him.

54:26.741 --> 54:30.005
That's all I had to do,
is pray with the man,

54:30.179 --> 54:32.443
but I said no.

54:32.617 --> 54:34.749
Why didn't I just pray
with the man, pastor?

54:37.230 --> 54:39.232
Travis, I'm sure that

54:39.406 --> 54:41.060
your friend understands
why you didn't pray.

54:41.234 --> 54:42.670
He died!

54:45.282 --> 54:47.284
[sniffles] That's what
I understand, pastor, he died,

54:47.458 --> 54:51.853
all of 'em, 35 men, ambushed.

54:55.944 --> 54:58.512
Travis, I have never served
in the military...

55:01.776 --> 55:05.345
so I'm not going to sit here
and pretend

55:05.519 --> 55:09.784
to even... possibly relate

55:09.958 --> 55:11.917
to the hell
that you've been through.

55:14.180 --> 55:17.183
But I can tell you this, son.

55:17.357 --> 55:22.275
I have seen God
turn tragedies into miracles.

55:22.449 --> 55:25.104
As a Christian,

55:25.278 --> 55:28.281
I believe
we should all believe

55:28.455 --> 55:31.676
that God's ways
are higher than our ways.

55:31.850 --> 55:33.242
We might not understand
what He's doing,

55:33.417 --> 55:36.028
but He always has a plan.

55:38.726 --> 55:42.382
Hood: I believe God heard
your friend's prayers.

55:42.556 --> 55:46.517
I believe God answered
your friend's prayers.

55:46.691 --> 55:50.695
His prayers for himself
and his prayers for you.

55:52.610 --> 55:55.352
And I also believe, Travis,

55:55.526 --> 55:59.356
that God has a much greater plan
for your life than war.

56:03.490 --> 56:06.014
[sniffles] Man, that's the same
thing he said that night.

56:10.889 --> 56:13.370
I'm not saying any of this
to make you feel better.

56:14.980 --> 56:17.112
I'm saying it
because I believe it.

56:18.766 --> 56:21.421
Preach used to always say,

56:21.595 --> 56:23.031
he said, "Travis...

56:29.124 --> 56:30.648
don't leave this Earth...

56:34.391 --> 56:36.871
without making sure
your soul is ready."

56:41.267 --> 56:43.138
But I don't know
when I'm leaving this Earth.

56:45.184 --> 56:47.055
But I know my soul ain't ready.

56:49.623 --> 56:50.537
No.

56:54.715 --> 56:56.761
I'm gonna read you something
out of this book...

56:58.893 --> 57:00.765
that you've probably
heard before.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.732
"Who is it
that overcomes the world?"

57:14.169 --> 57:17.172
"Only he who believes
that Jesus is the Son of God."

57:24.615 --> 57:29.489
Travis, I know you were baptized
as a child,

57:29.663 --> 57:32.100
but the Bible says,
"He who believes

57:32.274 --> 57:35.452
and is baptized will be saved."

57:44.025 --> 57:46.158
I don't know if I'm ready
for all that yet.

57:47.289 --> 57:48.943
I get it.

57:49.117 --> 57:52.730
I'm not asking you
to make that decision tonight,

57:52.904 --> 57:56.864
but I do want you to know
that your faith is gonna grow...

57:58.649 --> 58:01.216
and your trust in the Lord
is gonna grow,

58:01.390 --> 58:04.916
and that trust and that faith is
gonna lead you to that pool...

58:08.441 --> 58:09.747
or one like it.

58:15.753 --> 58:17.450
Well, first
I'd like to say welcome.

58:17.624 --> 58:20.366
I'm so happy that all of you
decided to join us here today.

58:20.540 --> 58:22.977
I wanna remind everyone
that this is a safe space.

58:23.151 --> 58:26.981
This is a space that we share,
that we respect one another

58:27.155 --> 58:29.897
and one another's feelings...

58:31.856 --> 58:33.510
Come on in and join us.

58:34.728 --> 58:36.338
You're right on time.

58:42.562 --> 58:45.217
[sighs] Well,
tonight we're gonna start

58:45.391 --> 58:46.697
with a very simple exercise,

58:46.871 --> 58:49.003
one that many of you
have done before.

58:49.177 --> 58:52.224
I'm really happy
that you, um, you came tonight.

58:53.617 --> 58:56.837
Yeah, me, too. It was different.

58:57.011 --> 58:59.797
[sighs] Pastor Hood told me

58:59.971 --> 59:01.668
about what happened
the other day.

59:03.583 --> 59:05.193
That was different, too.

59:05.367 --> 59:09.154
No. That was God, Travis.

59:09.328 --> 59:11.548
God working His miracles.

59:12.592 --> 59:14.507
- Tiff.
- Yeah?

59:15.856 --> 59:17.554
Talk to you for a second?

59:20.078 --> 59:22.123
- I had a friend.
- Mm-hmm.

59:23.211 --> 59:24.517
Named Preach.

59:25.518 --> 59:27.346
This was his.

59:27.520 --> 59:30.218
He used to say stuff like
what you said all the time.

59:32.438 --> 59:35.049
- You wanna hear about them?
- Of course.

59:35.223 --> 59:36.703
Hood: When the disciples
heard this,

59:36.877 --> 59:39.663
they were greatly astonished
and asked,

59:39.837 --> 59:42.753
"Who then can be saved?"

59:42.927 --> 59:45.233
Jesus answered them and said,

59:45.407 --> 59:48.149
"With man, this is impossible,

59:48.323 --> 59:51.544
but with God,
all things are possible."

59:51.718 --> 59:53.372
Man: Praise God.
All: Amen.

59:53.546 --> 59:57.115
Hood: Praise Jesus. Thank you,
Lord. Thank you, Lord.

59:58.420 --> 59:59.770
Thank you.

59:59.944 --> 1:00:02.468
- God bless you, sir.
- God bless you.

1:00:02.642 --> 1:00:05.297
Well, Deacon Tiffany.

1:00:05.471 --> 1:00:07.734
- Great sermon, pastor.
- Thank you.

1:00:07.908 --> 1:00:10.737
- Travis, it's good to have you.
- It's good to be here.

1:00:10.911 --> 1:00:13.958
It felt really good
to be here today. Enjoyed it.

1:00:14.132 --> 1:00:15.568
I know you've got to report back
for duty soon,

1:00:15.742 --> 1:00:18.963
but I've got a little favor
I wanna ask you.

1:00:19.137 --> 1:00:20.529
What's that, pastor?

1:00:20.704 --> 1:00:22.053
I was wondering
if you might be willing

1:00:22.227 --> 1:00:23.532
to share your testimony

1:00:23.707 --> 1:00:25.360
at Bible study Wednesday night.

1:00:25.534 --> 1:00:26.710
Now, I know it might be
a little soon--

1:00:26.884 --> 1:00:27.972
Nah, I'll do it.

1:00:28.146 --> 1:00:29.713
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

1:00:29.887 --> 1:00:32.803
Yeah, I mean, it'd be different,

1:00:32.977 --> 1:00:35.632
but my therapist suggested
that I start talking more,

1:00:35.806 --> 1:00:37.503
you know,
share my feelings, so...

1:00:37.677 --> 1:00:39.374
She's a smart lady.

1:00:39.548 --> 1:00:42.160
Tell you what, maybe that
therapist, whoever she may be,

1:00:42.334 --> 1:00:44.728
might help you find the reason
to come back home

1:00:44.902 --> 1:00:46.338
before another three years
goes by.

1:00:46.512 --> 1:00:49.167
Tiffany: Hm.
- It's just a thought.

1:00:49.341 --> 1:00:51.038
Yeah, maybe.

1:00:53.084 --> 1:00:53.998
Wow.

1:00:55.956 --> 1:00:59.220
You know, I think Preach
would be proud of me right now.

1:00:59.394 --> 1:01:02.223
I think he is very proud of you
right now.

1:01:04.182 --> 1:01:07.402
[chuckles] Let's go.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:12.581
[cell phone ringing]

1:01:16.237 --> 1:01:17.456
- Hey, Pops.
Pops: Hello, son.

1:01:17.630 --> 1:01:19.719
Have you seen
Donnie at all today?

1:01:19.893 --> 1:01:22.504
No, actually, I haven't seen
or heard from him all day.

1:01:22.679 --> 1:01:25.029
Pops: Okay.
Uh, can you do me a favor?

1:01:25.203 --> 1:01:27.640
- Sure, yeah, okay.
- Will you check Parkers and--

1:01:27.814 --> 1:01:28.859
I'll talk to the Parkers,
no problem.

1:01:29.033 --> 1:01:30.948
- And give me a call?
- Okay.

1:01:31.122 --> 1:01:32.819
Pops: His poor mother's
worried to death.

1:01:32.993 --> 1:01:33.951
Alright.

1:01:37.737 --> 1:01:39.957
[laughing]

1:01:44.875 --> 1:01:47.747
[chuckles] Well,
you can practice all you want,

1:01:47.921 --> 1:01:49.923
you know,
you'll never be able to...

1:01:51.272 --> 1:01:53.492
Who did that to your face, man?

1:01:53.666 --> 1:01:54.754
- It's not your business.
- Okay, well...

1:01:54.928 --> 1:01:56.800
I'm making it my business.

1:01:59.324 --> 1:02:01.326
Look, I screwed up, man.

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:04.416
I screwed up real bad
and cost my dad his shop.

1:02:04.590 --> 1:02:06.679
So, what, this Big Six guy,
he taking Pops' money

1:02:06.853 --> 1:02:08.899
'cause of something you did?

1:02:09.073 --> 1:02:10.596
And now there's only one way
out of this.

1:02:10.770 --> 1:02:12.685
How, Donnie?

1:02:12.859 --> 1:02:15.122
Big Six has some cross-town
rival named Suarez,

1:02:15.296 --> 1:02:17.211
who runs the Latino Vice Lords.

1:02:17.385 --> 1:02:18.778
So what does that have to do
with you?

1:02:18.952 --> 1:02:20.737
I don't know,
Suarez has a major drug shipment

1:02:20.911 --> 1:02:23.000
coming in this weekend,
and Big Six found out

1:02:23.174 --> 1:02:24.566
where he's keeping the cash
to pay for the score,

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:26.177
at his girl's crib
on Station Ave.

1:02:26.351 --> 1:02:29.267
And he wants you
to lift the cash for him?

1:02:29.441 --> 1:02:30.398
Donnie, you can't do that, man.

1:02:30.572 --> 1:02:31.878
Yeah, I told him that last night

1:02:32.052 --> 1:02:34.794
and his goon Damon
wasn't having it.

1:02:34.968 --> 1:02:37.623
Look, listen to me,
you go down to Pops' shop,

1:02:37.797 --> 1:02:40.234
have them close up early today.

1:02:40.408 --> 1:02:41.627
- What?
- Look, Donnie, we both know.

1:02:41.801 --> 1:02:43.455
How this game is played,
alright?

1:02:43.629 --> 1:02:45.239
Go have Pops close early

1:02:45.413 --> 1:02:48.590
and then you go home
and stay there, alright?

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:50.288
- I'll call you later.
- Well, Travis, wait!

1:02:50.462 --> 1:02:52.551
Go, Donnie!

1:02:52.725 --> 1:02:54.292
I'll take care of it, man.

1:02:55.510 --> 1:02:56.424
- Travis!
Travis: Go!

1:02:56.598 --> 1:02:57.861
Travis!

1:03:03.867 --> 1:03:05.738
Hey, you know we didn't get
a chance to go by that last spot

1:03:05.912 --> 1:03:07.914
and get that money.

1:03:08.088 --> 1:03:10.699
Big Six: We can't take
no more errors, alright?

1:03:10.874 --> 1:03:12.745
Hey, Six, I'll be right back.

1:03:13.702 --> 1:03:16.270
[line ringing]

1:03:16.444 --> 1:03:19.404
Hey, let me get some steaks off.

1:03:19.578 --> 1:03:21.885
- Okay.
- Hey. Yeah.

1:03:22.059 --> 1:03:25.018
No, no, no, I'mma-- I'mma have
the money. I promise.

1:03:25.192 --> 1:03:29.631
You know I'm good for it, man.
Yeah.

1:03:29.806 --> 1:03:32.156
No, no, no, look,
I just, I just got to be...

1:03:37.639 --> 1:03:39.250
Let me call you back.

1:03:42.993 --> 1:03:44.908
He lost his appetite.

1:03:45.952 --> 1:03:47.040
[sniffles]

1:03:47.911 --> 1:03:49.608
[claps]

1:03:49.782 --> 1:03:54.265
Well played, army boy.
Well played.

1:03:54.439 --> 1:03:56.136
Guess he won't be needing this.

1:03:57.921 --> 1:03:59.487
You mind passing me the sugar?

1:03:59.661 --> 1:04:01.663
Well, Donnie won't be lifting
that money for you.

1:04:01.838 --> 1:04:03.970
Well, that little fool
just can't keep

1:04:04.144 --> 1:04:05.580
his mouth shut, now, can he?

1:04:05.754 --> 1:04:08.409
And Pops ain't giving you
no more money.

1:04:08.583 --> 1:04:11.456
Wait, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
look at here now.

1:04:11.630 --> 1:04:13.719
Same thing I told Donnie.

1:04:13.893 --> 1:04:17.114
Everybody pays, alright?

1:04:17.288 --> 1:04:20.073
You go near Donnie again,
you touch Donnie,

1:04:20.247 --> 1:04:23.424
you go near Pops' shop,
I'm coming back.

1:04:23.598 --> 1:04:25.078
And the next time
it won't be your boy out there

1:04:25.252 --> 1:04:27.994
laying in his own blood,
you understand that?

1:04:33.913 --> 1:04:36.437
Hey, army boy.

1:04:36.611 --> 1:04:39.701
Heard you've been asking
a lot of questions around town

1:04:39.876 --> 1:04:43.749
about your parents and their,
um, untimely accident.

1:04:43.923 --> 1:04:45.838
Look, you better be real careful
with the next few words

1:04:46.012 --> 1:04:47.709
that come up out of your mouth.

1:04:47.884 --> 1:04:50.234
Ain't nobody got nothing
to tell you, man.

1:04:51.583 --> 1:04:53.063
But maybe I do.

1:04:53.933 --> 1:04:55.848
[laughs]

1:04:57.154 --> 1:04:58.459
Talk, man.

1:05:00.374 --> 1:05:04.161
No. I'm done talking.

1:05:04.335 --> 1:05:06.206
You wanna hear
what I got to say?

1:05:06.380 --> 1:05:10.080
You already know what you got
to do for me. Alright?

1:05:10.254 --> 1:05:12.125
How do I know you're not lying?

1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:14.998
You don't.

1:05:15.172 --> 1:05:17.130
But what you do wanna know is...

1:05:18.349 --> 1:05:20.090
what really happened that night.

1:05:20.264 --> 1:05:23.136
Ah. [laughs]

1:05:26.357 --> 1:05:28.446
Oh, oh, okay.

1:05:28.620 --> 1:05:30.491
So what, you gonna cut me now?

1:05:30.665 --> 1:05:34.017
Go ahead, army boy,
poke me full of holes.

1:05:34.191 --> 1:05:35.801
But you know what,
everything that I know

1:05:35.975 --> 1:05:37.716
about what really happened
that night

1:05:37.890 --> 1:05:40.414
is gonna bleed out
all over this table.

1:05:45.332 --> 1:05:46.290
Yeah.

1:05:48.379 --> 1:05:50.990
[chuckles] Hey, come on, man.

1:05:51.164 --> 1:05:53.384
Now, that's just disrespectful.

1:05:53.558 --> 1:05:57.040
[chuckles] You're just gonna
ruin my brunch, huh?

1:05:57.214 --> 1:05:58.302
Alright.

1:05:58.476 --> 1:06:00.173
Hey, army boy,

1:06:00.347 --> 1:06:03.481
you wanna know what really
happened, you get me my money.

1:06:04.525 --> 1:06:06.005
[door shuts]

1:06:14.535 --> 1:06:16.537
Travis on phone:
Donnie, it's me.

1:06:16.711 --> 1:06:19.149
Where are you? You okay?
What'd you do?

1:06:19.323 --> 1:06:21.064
He said he knows something
about my parents' accident.

1:06:21.238 --> 1:06:22.891
What? Who, Big Six?

1:06:23.066 --> 1:06:24.676
Yeah, so I'mma have to lift
his money for him.

1:06:24.850 --> 1:06:27.418
Travis, you can't do that!
He's lying, man!

1:06:27.592 --> 1:06:29.028
Look, I done talked to everybody
who knows anything

1:06:29.202 --> 1:06:30.899
about my parents' accident.

1:06:31.074 --> 1:06:33.206
- Ain't got no choice, Donnie.
- He doesn't know nothing!

1:06:33.380 --> 1:06:35.513
Listen, Travis,
stay out of this, okay?

1:06:35.687 --> 1:06:37.602
Big Six is not playing around,
if you steal that money,

1:06:37.776 --> 1:06:39.169
you know exactly
what he's gonna do to you.

1:06:39.343 --> 1:06:41.127
Don't matter,
I ain't got no choice. Look.

1:06:41.301 --> 1:06:42.868
I got something else
I got to do at the church.

1:06:43.042 --> 1:06:45.175
You just stay home
like I told you, alright?

1:06:47.003 --> 1:06:48.743
Travis. Travis!

1:06:53.096 --> 1:06:56.012
[cell phone vibrating]

1:07:05.064 --> 1:07:08.763
Tonight we're gonna
shake things up a little bit.

1:07:08.937 --> 1:07:10.722
Sometimes it's easy for us
to forget

1:07:10.896 --> 1:07:12.898
that real life

1:07:13.072 --> 1:07:16.162
can be really complicated
sometimes.

1:07:17.990 --> 1:07:21.994
So tonight
we are going to be blessed

1:07:22.168 --> 1:07:24.953
by a very powerful testimony.

1:07:25.128 --> 1:07:27.173
So if I have your permission,

1:07:27.347 --> 1:07:29.871
I'm gonna trade places
with Travis,

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:33.266
and he's gonna come up here
and share his story.

1:07:34.354 --> 1:07:37.227
[applauding]

1:07:40.404 --> 1:07:42.928
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

1:07:43.102 --> 1:07:44.060
[clears throat]

1:07:47.367 --> 1:07:51.676
[sighs] Well, uh, good evening,
everybody.

1:07:51.850 --> 1:07:56.072
Um, my name is Sergeant
First Class Travis Fox.

1:07:56.246 --> 1:07:57.203
Wanda on phone: Did Donnie
show up at all?

1:07:57.377 --> 1:07:59.075
Well, no, he never showed up.

1:07:59.249 --> 1:08:02.034
Uh, Travis went looking for him,
but he didn't call me back.

1:08:02.208 --> 1:08:04.515
Wanda: I'm worried, Joe.
- I'm sure he's fine.

1:08:04.689 --> 1:08:06.952
Wanda: Will you be home soon?
- Yeah, I'm locking up now.

1:08:07.126 --> 1:08:09.172
Wanda: I love you.
- Alright, love you, too.

1:08:10.216 --> 1:08:11.565
[gunshots]

1:08:12.784 --> 1:08:14.655
Wanda on phone: Joe?

1:08:14.829 --> 1:08:18.659
Joe? What was that? Joe!

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:22.489
Look, for a long time
I was using my parents' death

1:08:22.663 --> 1:08:24.361
as a reason to hate God.

1:08:27.015 --> 1:08:30.454
But I realized that's not true.

1:08:30.628 --> 1:08:33.805
I started hating God
a long time ago.

1:08:33.979 --> 1:08:36.764
You see, over the years,

1:08:36.938 --> 1:08:40.203
I've lost a lot of friends
in this war.

1:08:40.377 --> 1:08:41.856
And I don't blame
the government,

1:08:42.030 --> 1:08:44.511
I don't blame the military.

1:08:44.685 --> 1:08:47.732
I mean, we-- we-- we knew
what we were doing.

1:08:47.906 --> 1:08:50.213
We knew where we were going.

1:08:50.387 --> 1:08:52.345
We knew what we was
getting ourselves into.

1:08:54.826 --> 1:08:57.481
We just didn't know...

1:08:57.655 --> 1:09:00.136
what will happen to us
when we came back.

1:09:00.310 --> 1:09:02.268
After all the violence ends...

1:09:03.704 --> 1:09:06.185
certain things stay with you.

1:09:06.359 --> 1:09:10.146
Then you start seeing
the faces of the dead.

1:09:11.625 --> 1:09:13.671
You want it to stop,
but it don't.

1:09:15.107 --> 1:09:17.196
And it happens all the time,

1:09:17.370 --> 1:09:21.766
while you eating,
when you're sleeping.

1:09:21.940 --> 1:09:26.684
Travis: And then you start
thinking about other options...

1:09:28.512 --> 1:09:30.514
'cause you want the pain
to stop.

1:09:32.516 --> 1:09:34.605
And that's when you start
convincing yourself...

1:09:38.261 --> 1:09:41.916
maybe dying is a far better
option than living.

1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:51.535
I was facing that option
last week...

1:09:53.450 --> 1:09:56.496
out there in your parking lot.

1:09:59.020 --> 1:10:00.326
Travis: Live or die.

1:10:04.765 --> 1:10:06.941
And I put my gun on my head.

1:10:16.081 --> 1:10:17.996
[sobbing]

1:10:21.304 --> 1:10:23.131
I put my gun to my head...

1:10:25.133 --> 1:10:27.005
and I said some things to God.

1:10:28.963 --> 1:10:30.356
I thought these would be
the last words

1:10:30.530 --> 1:10:32.750
that I would ever speak
in this lifetime.

1:10:36.014 --> 1:10:37.407
I told him...

1:10:39.626 --> 1:10:43.543
"If you love me
the way Preach said you do,

1:10:43.717 --> 1:10:45.415
you always love me,

1:10:45.589 --> 1:10:49.201
you always good all the time...

1:10:52.204 --> 1:10:53.945
you got to show me."

1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:58.906
"You got to show me
right here, right now."

1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:04.956
"You're gonna show me...

1:11:06.479 --> 1:11:08.568
that I belong to you
and you love me."

1:11:10.353 --> 1:11:12.616
"That I belong to you,
I'm one of yours."

1:11:14.661 --> 1:11:16.228
And I hear nothing.

1:11:18.099 --> 1:11:19.492
I ain't feel nothing.

1:11:22.626 --> 1:11:24.367
So I was about
to pull the trigger.

1:11:27.979 --> 1:11:30.286
That's when the doors
of this church opened...

1:11:32.636 --> 1:11:34.377
and your pastor walked out.

1:11:34.551 --> 1:11:37.423
[instrumental music]

1:11:39.643 --> 1:11:40.731
Look...

1:11:42.907 --> 1:11:45.910
I didn't come here tonight to
tell you all that I'm healed...

1:11:47.390 --> 1:11:48.739
'cause I'm not.

1:11:50.610 --> 1:11:52.525
I have PTSD.

1:11:55.267 --> 1:11:57.835
And there's a long road ahead
for me.

1:11:59.663 --> 1:12:00.925
I know that.

1:12:02.796 --> 1:12:04.798
Well, I'm seeking
medical attention...

1:12:07.627 --> 1:12:09.325
to heal my mind.

1:12:12.719 --> 1:12:14.330
And I'm seeking God...

1:12:16.636 --> 1:12:20.118
to heal my soul, my heart.

1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:23.643
And I'm determined...

1:12:25.776 --> 1:12:27.908
to find my way back to God.

1:12:29.693 --> 1:12:32.565
[applauding]

1:12:40.704 --> 1:12:42.314
- Is this the gunshot victim?
- Yes.

1:12:42.488 --> 1:12:43.489
Room four.

1:12:43.663 --> 1:12:46.536
[siren blaring]

1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:51.976
Hood: Come in here,
all of you who fear God,

1:12:52.150 --> 1:12:55.675
and I will share
what He has done for my soul.

1:12:55.849 --> 1:12:58.374
Son, your words
really moved the house tonight.

1:12:59.331 --> 1:13:00.724
Thank you, pastor.

1:13:00.898 --> 1:13:02.116
Appreciate you
letting me talk to 'em.

1:13:02.290 --> 1:13:04.771
I appreciate you coming.

1:13:04.945 --> 1:13:06.643
Wish I could stay longer,

1:13:06.817 --> 1:13:09.950
but, um, I have something else
I need to do.

1:13:12.257 --> 1:13:14.172
It's Pops.

1:13:14.346 --> 1:13:16.043
Damon: He should be here by now.

1:13:17.654 --> 1:13:19.525
Check it.

1:13:19.699 --> 1:13:22.354
After we handle the war hero,
man,

1:13:22.528 --> 1:13:26.619
I want you to put a call
into them out-of-town guys, man.

1:13:26.793 --> 1:13:30.884
Tell them I wanna take out
Donnie and his mama, too.

1:13:32.886 --> 1:13:34.018
Got it.

1:13:36.847 --> 1:13:39.676
- What happened?
- He was closing the shop.

1:13:39.850 --> 1:13:44.202
We were on the phone together,
then I heard gunshots. [sobbing]

1:13:44.376 --> 1:13:46.465
- Was Donnie there?
- No.

1:13:46.639 --> 1:13:48.598
He didn't show up for work
today.

1:13:48.772 --> 1:13:50.034
Okay.
So what did the doctor say?

1:13:50.208 --> 1:13:52.428
He said the next couple of days

1:13:52.602 --> 1:13:54.386
will determine
if he will make it.

1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:56.344
Don't worry about that,
Ms. Wanda.

1:13:56.519 --> 1:13:59.043
Pops a ranger. He'll make it.

1:14:00.131 --> 1:14:02.220
[intense music]

1:14:02.394 --> 1:14:05.092
- Where did you get that?
- What? What?

1:14:05.266 --> 1:14:07.617
That necklace!
Where did you get that necklace?

1:14:07.791 --> 1:14:09.009

necklace, alright?

1:14:21.935 --> 1:14:23.676

my mother's necklace?

1:14:23.850 --> 1:14:26.505

1:15:07.590 --> 1:15:11.419
Yeah, but we out here exposed
on Suarez's turf.

1:15:11.594 --> 1:15:13.987
The longer we sit here,

1:15:14.161 --> 1:15:16.860
We alright.
No, no, trust me, we alright.

1:15:17.034 --> 1:15:18.296
All I'm saying is--

1:15:18.470 --> 1:15:21.081
Look, I just said
we alright, okay?

1:15:21.255 --> 1:15:22.909
We gotta get this money, man,

1:15:23.083 --> 1:15:24.476
'cause if we don't get
this money,

1:15:24.650 --> 1:15:26.565
we gonna have to deal
with the connect.

1:15:26.739 --> 1:15:27.958
And you already know
what they gonna do.

my mother's necklace on!

1:15:54.158 --> 1:15:55.463
- How did you get it?
- I tried to tell you.

1:15:55.638 --> 1:15:56.813
So many times, okay, man,

1:15:56.987 --> 1:15:57.857
but I couldn't tell you that.

1:15:58.031 --> 1:15:59.250
I couldn't. I'm sorry!

1:15:59.424 --> 1:16:01.339
- I'm sorry!
- What happened, man?

1:16:01.513 --> 1:16:02.906
How did you get the necklace,
Donnie?

1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:05.604
Uh, Denzel, okay!

1:16:05.778 --> 1:16:07.824
He wanted to be the Big Six,

1:16:07.998 --> 1:16:10.087
so he made his move
to take over the turf.

1:16:10.261 --> 1:16:11.567
Donnie: He had a secret meet
with the previous Big

1:16:11.741 --> 1:16:13.481
and his two captains.

1:16:13.656 --> 1:16:16.528

1:16:25.145 --> 1:16:26.799

right at them, man.

1:16:26.973 --> 1:16:29.497
And they were already gone,
man.

1:16:29.672 --> 1:16:31.630
There was nothing I could do.

1:16:31.804 --> 1:16:34.372

I couldn't believe it.

man!

1:16:36.374 --> 1:16:38.811
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth, man?

1:16:38.985 --> 1:16:41.422
You're supposed to be
my best friend, Donnie.

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:43.511
You could have came to me!

1:16:51.432 --> 1:16:52.782
I couldn't, man. I couldn't.

1:16:52.956 --> 1:16:54.697

1:16:55.785 --> 1:16:58.222

in that house--

1:17:00.093 --> 1:17:01.747
- You ain't going in the house.
- And get that money...

1:17:01.921 --> 1:17:03.140
- You ain't going over there.
- They're gonna kill him.

1:17:03.314 --> 1:17:04.184

- Donnie.

1:17:04.358 --> 1:17:05.621

- Man, they shot Pops, man.
- What?

1:17:28.034 --> 1:17:29.732
They tried to kill him!

1:17:29.906 --> 1:17:31.124
And if the game
is still the same,

1:17:31.298 --> 1:17:32.169
you and your mother are next!

1:17:32.343 --> 1:17:33.997
They killed my dad?

You know the answer to that.

1:17:52.885 --> 1:17:55.627
So what happened? How did Donnie
get your mother's necklace?

1:17:55.801 --> 1:17:58.543
- It's not your concern.
- Travis, please.

- Ain't no buts.

you or nobody else can tell me

1:18:26.963 --> 1:18:29.356
that God cares about me
when all He's ever done

1:18:29.530 --> 1:18:31.141
is take away anybody
who's ever loved

1:18:31.315 --> 1:18:33.709

so I'm through.

1:18:33.883 --> 1:18:35.580

Hood: I'm here to tell you,
he does.

1:19:53.484 --> 1:19:55.268

1:19:59.490 --> 1:20:01.187

of every sparrow

1:20:03.537 --> 1:20:06.976

about each and every one of us

1:20:07.150 --> 1:20:09.805
whom He has created
in His own image?

1:20:13.199 --> 1:20:15.419
Today we are going to baptize
these believers

1:20:15.593 --> 1:20:19.989
in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1:20:20.163 --> 1:20:24.428
