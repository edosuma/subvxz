00:02.760 --> 00:05.160
# Well, you came and you gave... #

00:05.160 --> 00:09.480
"In 20 words or less, say why
you deserve a holiday with McVitie's

00:09.480 --> 00:11.840
"Jammie Faces."

00:09.480 --> 00:11.840
DOOR OPENS

00:11.840 --> 00:13.840
Ah, Mandy.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.400
Why do I deserve a holiday?

00:15.400 --> 00:18.240
McVitie's are having a competition
to win a cruise.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.920
You have to collect a lot
of coupons, but luckily I eat

00:20.920 --> 00:23.040
lots of biscuits for the vitamins.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.560
I have to say in 20 words or less
why I deserve a holiday. Right.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.320
You need to pull at the heartstrings
here,

00:29.320 --> 00:30.640
get them feeling sorry for you.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.000
OK. I deserve a holiday

00:34.000 --> 00:39.360
with McVitie's Jammie Faces

00:39.360 --> 00:41.880
because... All your family
have just died

00:41.880 --> 00:43.840
in an industrial explosion.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.280
That's ten words, I need ten more.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.640
And you have only three months left
to live yourself.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.080
20.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.440
Pop it in the post.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.440
Mandy! # I won the competition. #

01:03.440 --> 01:05.640
Oh, my God! Fantastic!

01:05.640 --> 01:07.720
Can I come with you?

01:07.720 --> 01:09.400
Mandy, I'm so sorry.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.400
The holiday is for one person only.
That can't be right.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.200
Who gives a holiday for one?

01:14.200 --> 01:16.440
McVitie's. I'm sorry.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.840
Oh, God.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.160
It's fine, you go.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.360
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.440
Don't give me a moment's thought.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.320
You just enjoy yourself.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.720
HORN BLOWS

01:51.680 --> 01:54.840
Mandy, what are you doing
in there? Coming with you, Lo!

01:54.840 --> 01:57.520
Holiday for one? What do
McVitie's think they're playing at?

01:57.520 --> 01:59.400
But where will you sleep? If you get
found out,

01:59.400 --> 02:01.080
we will both be thrown
off. It's fine.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.040
There's hundreds of fuckers
on this ship.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.640
They can't keep track of everyone.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.400
And how are they going to throw us
off?

02:06.400 --> 02:08.760
We're at sea. It's not like they can
throw us overboard.

02:08.760 --> 02:11.120
KNOCK ON DOOR

02:08.760 --> 02:11.120
Oh, shit, zip me back in.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.400
Hello. What is your name, please?
Lola Okinado Akimbo.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.480
Ah, yes, here you are -
the competition winner.

02:25.480 --> 02:28.400
Sorry to hear about your family.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.360
You are travelling alone,
aren't you?

02:30.360 --> 02:34.360
Erm, yes. It's just that we've had
trouble with McVitie's winners

02:34.360 --> 02:37.280
before who seem to think
that eating their own body weight

02:37.280 --> 02:40.400
in Happy Crunch entitles them to
bring stowaways.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.000
Well, I'm all alone.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.480
I'm glad to hear it.
That's a big case.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.200
Well, I've never
been on a cruise before.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.440
I didn't know what to pack,
so I packed everything!

02:52.760 --> 02:53.800
Right.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.760
Well...enjoy your holiday.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.720
SHE SIGHS

03:05.400 --> 03:06.720
What a misery.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.000
He's probably been at sea
too long.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.280
MANDY, MUFFLED: He doesn't even know
McVitie's

03:11.280 --> 03:12.920
don't make Happy Crunch
any more.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.480
I'm not sure they ever did,
actually.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.880
I think it may have been another

03:15.880 --> 03:18.000
of Britain's leading biscuit
manufacturers.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.720
Hello.
Now I know you have someone in here.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.080
I just heard them.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.080
No! You must be mistaken.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.440
I'm here all alone.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.200
I'm going to have to ask
to look in your case.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.680
No, you don't have any right
to do that.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.440
Oh, you should know, madam,
that as ship's purser

03:35.440 --> 03:38.520
I have the authority to investigate
possible stowaways

03:38.520 --> 03:39.920
under the Piracy Act 1793.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.040
It's maritime law, the rule
of the sea.

03:44.200 --> 03:49.160
Now what have we...

03:49.160 --> 03:50.200
..here?!

03:54.640 --> 03:56.720
I'll be watching you,

03:56.720 --> 03:59.440
Lola Okinado Akimbo.

04:02.520 --> 04:06.000
What a prick. Oh, Mandy, you are
going to have to keep

04:06.000 --> 04:07.800
a very low profile
on this trip.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.240
Don't worry about me.
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.760
You won't even know I'm here.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.080
You cannot sleep here, Mandy.
There's no room.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.920
And that purser will be looking for
you.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.400
I don't want to get
you into trouble, Lola.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.520
I'll find somewhere else to sleep.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.040
HORN BLOWS

05:42.280 --> 05:43.800
HORN BLOWS

05:43.800 --> 05:46.040
..kin' hell, is this all free?

05:46.040 --> 05:49.400
Yes, it's all included,
except the continental cheeses.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.480
All right. They are extra. OK.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.920
Hey, I'm having a go at that.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.160
That's brilliant, that.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.720
Oh, very entertaining, indeed.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.040
Thank you, Margaret.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.080
GLASS SINGS

06:08.040 --> 06:10.080
Margaret, thank you so much.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.080
That's a lovely, that is. Brilliant.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.520
Now it's time for our next
contestant.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.680
Who have we got? let's have a look.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.920
OK, and what is your name,
my darling?

06:19.920 --> 06:21.640
Mandy Carter.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.000
Mandy. What a lovely name.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.120
And what are you going to do
for us tonight, my love?

06:25.120 --> 06:27.960
I'm going to swallow a tangerine
whole. You're going to what?

06:27.960 --> 06:30.280
RAISES VOICE: I'm going to swallow a
tangerine whole.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.000
Oh, is that dangerous?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.600
Yeah, it can be.
I nearly died last time I did it,

06:34.600 --> 06:36.600
but luckily my neck muscles crushed

06:36.600 --> 06:38.840
it and pushed it down at the last
minute.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.800
Oh! Well, let's just hope there's
a doctor on board.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.840
OK, well, Mandy, in your own time,
take it away.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.880
DRUM ROLL

07:18.440 --> 07:20.680
How about that, everyone?

07:18.440 --> 07:20.680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

07:20.680 --> 07:23.080
Wow, that were tense, Mandy.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.840
What an extraordinary talent.
Isn't it?

07:25.840 --> 07:28.600
You've seen now
all of our super talented

07:28.600 --> 07:31.840
contestants, but it's now time
for you to choose a winner.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.680
So in front of you, you'll see
a piece of paper and a pen.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.720
And if you would like to write
down the number of the contestant

07:37.720 --> 07:39.400
that you enjoyed the most.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.560
So once all the results are in,
we will announce the winners.

07:42.560 --> 07:46.120
But in the meantime, here's a song
about losers.

07:47.120 --> 07:52.000
# Every loser wins

07:52.000 --> 07:54.120
# Once the day begins... #

07:54.120 --> 07:56.520
Well done, Mandy! Oh, thanks, Lo!

07:56.520 --> 07:58.480
Hey, you don't know where the bogs
are, do you?

07:58.480 --> 08:01.080
I think I had too much to eat
in that all-you-can-eat buffet.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.760
Down the corridor, on your left.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.560
# Every loser wins... #

08:21.560 --> 08:23.320
Go on, down you go.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.520
OK, well,
we're just counting the votes.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.960
I think we do have a winner, do we?

08:27.960 --> 08:30.880
The winner will have the honour

08:30.880 --> 08:34.880
of winning a ticket to sit
and dine with the captain.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.560
Oh, that's posh.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.680
FLUSHING

08:39.200 --> 08:41.320
Oh, don't... Oh, God.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.640
We do have a winner.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.240
OK, well, the winner is number ten,
Mandy Carter.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

08:57.920 --> 08:59.400
Thank you. Thank you.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.960
Are you pleased? Yeah.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.320
I'm really pleased.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.840
It's not about the winning, is it?

09:04.840 --> 09:06.480
It's just nice to be entered.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.400
Captain, have I introduced
you to Mandy Carter?

09:14.400 --> 09:16.600
She's the winner of the talent
competition,

09:16.600 --> 09:19.240
and her lovely friend, Lola.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.880
Ah, Lola, the McVitie's
competition winner.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.120
I was sorry to hear about
the industrial explosion.

09:26.120 --> 09:30.200
I don't believe I've seen
you on the ship before, Mandy.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.960
Oh, well, I've been trying to blend
in.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.600
Mandy Carter.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.000
Carter, Mandy.

09:39.680 --> 09:44.320
So what is your talent,
Mandy Carter?

09:44.320 --> 09:47.080
Well, I can swallow
a tangerine whole.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.120
HOST LAUGHS

09:50.240 --> 09:53.120
That's a very fetching dress
you have on.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.840
Oh, thanks.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.840
It's just something I threw on.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.600
I served on HMS Invincible

09:59.600 --> 10:02.120
in the Falklands, by the way.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.480
I don't know what any of that means.

10:04.480 --> 10:08.440
Would you show me this trick you do
with the tangerine, Mandy?

10:08.440 --> 10:10.360
Yeah, yeah. Have you got one?

10:10.360 --> 10:11.640
I'm the captain.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.520
I can get whatever I want.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.560
Steward.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.280
Tangerine, now.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.320
Would you care for another potato?

10:23.320 --> 10:24.360
Oh, ta!

10:28.360 --> 10:29.560
Take two.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.840
So what do I do? Like this?

10:35.840 --> 10:38.280
No, no, you have to peel it first!

10:46.440 --> 10:47.720
CAPTAIN MOANS

10:53.120 --> 10:54.440
Stand back, stand back!

10:54.440 --> 10:56.440
Don't panic, I am trained
in first aid.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.960
It's fine.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.480
It's going to be fine.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.920
I know the Heimalich manoeuvre.

11:00.920 --> 11:05.320
It's the Heimlich manoeuvre -
get it right.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.360
Come on!

11:10.440 --> 11:12.080
Cough it up.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.960
Remember the Falklands! Captain?

11:14.960 --> 11:16.440
Come on, get him up.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.680
THEY GASP

11:20.680 --> 11:22.920
Stand back, stand back, stand back.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.280
The Captain is dead.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.320
Oh!

12:02.280 --> 12:07.520
# Near, far, wherever you are

12:07.520 --> 12:13.440
# I believe that the heart
does go on

12:13.440 --> 12:17.800
# Once more, you open the door

12:17.800 --> 12:20.600
# And you're here in my heart

12:20.600 --> 12:24.360
# And my heart will go on

12:24.360 --> 12:27.480
# And on. #

12:27.480 --> 12:31.560
Yes, thank you. That was
very...moving.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.880
It is maritime tradition,

12:34.880 --> 12:39.920
the captain of a ship is buried
at sea. Since he served

12:39.920 --> 12:44.560
in the Falklands, it has been
the captain's wish to have his body

12:44.560 --> 12:46.600
fired from a cannon.

12:46.600 --> 12:51.120
But we have not had time to do
the proper risk assessment for that,

12:51.120 --> 12:55.720
and so we are just going to
slide him over the railings.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.720
You! Mandy Carter!

12:59.880 --> 13:03.480
I don't know how you have the nerve
to show your face here.

13:03.480 --> 13:07.240
First, you board this ship without a
ticket, then your so-called

13:07.240 --> 13:12.400
talent with a tangerine causes
the death of our beloved captain.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.440
I know when I'm not wanted.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.280
Stop...right...there.

13:17.280 --> 13:22.600
What now? Do you really think it is
appropriate to come to the funeral

13:22.600 --> 13:25.400
of a man who served in the Falklands

13:25.400 --> 13:28.240
wearing an Argentina football top?

13:30.120 --> 13:33.480
That's it!
Get this woman off my ship!

13:33.480 --> 13:35.240
HORN BLOWS

13:37.920 --> 13:42.680
I spy with my little eye,
something beginning with...

13:44.080 --> 13:45.360
..S.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.600
Sea.

13:46.600 --> 13:47.640
No. S.

13:48.880 --> 13:52.880
Sharks. Sky. Stowaway.

13:52.880 --> 13:55.040
No. Sinking ship.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.080
Look. Oh, my God.

13:58.280 --> 13:59.320
HORN BLOWS

14:01.120 --> 14:03.640
I knew there was something
wrong with that toilet.
