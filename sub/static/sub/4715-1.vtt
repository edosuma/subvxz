00:43.252 --> 00:51.591
<i>Seize upon that moment long ago</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:58.305
<i>One breath away
and there you will be</i>

00:58.475 --> 01:01.683
<i>So young and carefree</i>

01:01.853 --> 01:05.311
<i>Again you will see</i>

01:05.482 --> 01:08.599
<i>That place in time</i>

01:08.777 --> 01:13.020
<i>So gold</i>

01:13.198 --> 01:21.947
<i>Still away into that way back when</i>

01:24.167 --> 01:28.831
<i>You thought that all
would last for ever</i>

01:29.006 --> 01:32.248
<i>But like the weather</i>

01:32.426 --> 01:39.264
<i>Nothing can ever and be in time</i>

01:39.433 --> 01:43.426
<i>Stay gold</i>

01:44.605 --> 01:50.475
<i>But can it be when we can see</i>

01:50.652 --> 01:56.397
<i>So vividly a memory</i>

01:57.826 --> 01:59.817
<i>And "yes" you say</i>

01:59.995 --> 02:06.537
<i>So must the day too fade away</i>

02:06.710 --> 02:12.205
<i>And leave a ray of sun</i>

02:12.382 --> 02:17.422
<i>So gold</i>

02:18.138 --> 02:26.603
<i>Life is but a twinkling of an eye</i>

02:28.774 --> 02:33.768
<i>Yet filled with sorrow and compassion</i>

02:33.945 --> 02:40.612
<i>Though not imagined
all things that happen</i>

02:40.786 --> 02:44.370
<i>Will age too old</i>

02:44.539 --> 02:49.078
<i>Though gold</i>

02:49.252 --> 02:56.499
<i>Gold, though gold</i>

03:26.206 --> 03:28.367
<i>When I stepped out...</i>

03:30.293 --> 03:34.878
<i>into the bright sunlight</i>

03:35.048 --> 03:38.165
<i>from the darkness of the movie house,</i>

03:38.343 --> 03:42.052
<i>I had only two things on my mind.</i>

03:42.222 --> 03:44.508
<i>Paul Newman and a ride home.</i>

03:44.683 --> 03:46.548
"This is Ames, mister."

03:46.727 --> 03:49.218
Hey, look! Greaser!

03:53.567 --> 03:56.900
Wash all that grease
out of your hair, Greaser!

03:57.070 --> 03:58.230
Take a shower!

03:59.990 --> 04:01.480
<i>Don't you cramp my style
I'm a real wild child</i>

04:01.658 --> 04:04.491
<i>Come on, baby,
shake all night long...</i>

04:12.252 --> 04:13.788
<i>I'm gonna keep on movin', baby</i>

04:13.962 --> 04:16.668
<i>Don't you cramp my style
I'm a real wild child</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:20.290
<i>Yeah...</i>

04:30.520 --> 04:33.011
<i>Well, I'm gonna pick you up in my 88</i>

04:33.190 --> 04:35.772
<i>Get ready, sugar,
but don't be late</i>

04:35.942 --> 04:38.058
<i>We're gonna move it all night long</i>

04:38.236 --> 04:40.352
<i>Until a whole lot of shakin'
gonna be done</i>

04:40.530 --> 04:44.694
<i>I'm a wild one
Oh, yeah, I'm a wild one</i>

04:44.868 --> 04:47.200
<i>I'm gonna keep on shakin'
I'm gonna keep on movin', baby</i>

04:47.370 --> 04:50.157
<i>Don't you cramp my style
I'm a real wild child...</i>

04:50.332 --> 04:53.950
Hey, Greaser! Yeah!
We're gonna give him a haircut! Get him, guys!

04:57.547 --> 04:58.832
Get him down!

05:04.721 --> 05:07.337
<i>Don't you cramp my style
I'm a real wild child...</i>

05:11.186 --> 05:14.599
Stick it! Stick it in!
Go on! Do it!

05:14.773 --> 05:18.061
Maybe over here.
Or maybe how about there?

05:20.570 --> 05:22.526
Shut him up!

05:26.076 --> 05:29.113
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on! Let's go!

05:34.167 --> 05:36.499
- Hey!
- Get off!

05:38.421 --> 05:41.083
Them over there!

05:43.969 --> 05:45.425
Son of a bitch!

05:52.602 --> 05:54.183
We'll get you later, Greaser!

05:55.897 --> 05:58.889
Greaser! Greaser!

05:59.067 --> 06:00.773
<i>Watch out!</i>

06:01.945 --> 06:03.936
They didn't hurt you too bad, did they?

06:04.114 --> 06:05.854
- No.
- Hey, Pony.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.279
- Did they pull a blade on you?
- Yeah.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.451
Hey, they ain't gonna hurt you no more.
Come on.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.707
Walking by yourself!
You don't ever think!

06:17.878 --> 06:21.041
All's I did was walk home
from the movies.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.922
Movies and books. Movies and books!

06:25.093 --> 06:28.335
You know, I-I wish that you could
concentrate on something else

06:28.513 --> 06:30.128
just once in a while.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.891
Why don't you concentrate on girls and cars?
It works for me!

06:35.395 --> 06:39.229
Look, if you had to go by yourself,
you should have carried a blade.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.685
Oh, yeah, that would have been
a great excuse

06:40.860 --> 06:44.397
for the Socs to cut his neck
a little more there!

06:44.571 --> 06:47.084
If I want my kid brother to tell me
what to do with my other kid brother,

06:47.158 --> 06:50.740
I'll ask you, all right,
kid brother!

06:51.745 --> 06:55.954
Geez, Soda.
Why's he always gotta be like that?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.365
He's just got more worries
than he used to.

06:58.543 --> 07:01.034
- How's it, kid?
- I'm fine.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.123
What are you doing
out of the cooler, Dal?

07:03.298 --> 07:06.916
Yeah? And what are you doing walking
by your lonesome on the street, huh?

07:07.093 --> 07:11.177
- It's none of your business, Marty.
- It is my business! Look at my nose!

07:11.806 --> 07:13.387
It's huge!

07:13.558 --> 07:16.391
Smartass. He is a smartass kid.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.353
- Hey, Dally. How you doing?
- I'm doing all right, man.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.605
Thought you were in
for about 90 days, Dal.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.438
Yeah, I got out early, man.
Good behaviour, you know.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.655
Hey, Johnny, man.
How you doing, bro?

07:31.993 --> 07:33.199
Things would go a lot better,

07:33.370 --> 07:35.486
if the Socs stayed
on the southside of town, man.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.280
Don't worry. We're gonna have it out
with them sooner or later.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.995
We sure as hell are.
They keep coming over to our side of town.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.534
Damn right.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.583
Those the same guys that got you?

07:47.801 --> 07:50.338
No. They were other guys.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.924
Now that I'm out,
I'm gonna make it my business

07:53.098 --> 07:55.305
to get the guy
who did that to your face.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.057
What about me becoming
your personal body guard, huh, Ponyboy?

07:58.895 --> 08:01.932
I don't think
it's too hot of an idea.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.517
How about you and Sylvia coming over
to game with us tomorrow night?

08:06.695 --> 08:09.528
- I wanna go.
- Oh, we're taking Evie and Sandy.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.189
- Which means no kids allowed.
- Big deal!

08:12.367 --> 08:14.904
Nah, nah, nah.
I'm gonna go hunt some action.

08:15.078 --> 08:19.037
- If little kids are allowed.
- We'll go with you, won't we, Pony?

08:19.207 --> 08:22.699
I don't know, Dal.
I can't get in no trouble with the cops.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.789
Darry says the court
will split us up for sure if I do.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.670
Who's looking for police trouble, man?

08:27.841 --> 08:30.583
I wanna see a movie like
the good old days, right, Johnny?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.172
All right. Six o'clock.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.587
I was planning on putting down
a couple of six packs of Bud,

08:35.765 --> 08:37.676
but if I don't get too drunk,
I'll join y'all.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.549
Check this out, buddy!

08:46.943 --> 08:48.808
You guys wanna give me a push-start?

08:50.488 --> 08:52.524
Not really, but we will.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.489
All right! Let's go!

08:58.955 --> 09:00.286
See you guys later!

09:05.420 --> 09:07.456
I see you got your Christopher back, Dal.

09:11.968 --> 09:15.005
Little broad was two-timing me again
when I was in jail, man.

09:16.306 --> 09:19.264
It's cool. I'll see you guys later.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.841
- All right.
- See you later, Dal.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.887
Hey, Ponyboy, you got homework.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.273
You going home, Johnny Cade?

09:31.321 --> 09:33.357
I don't know.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.772
- See you around.
- All right.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.682
Turn off these lights
and get to bed.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.763
I got work in the morning.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.517
We leave them alone.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.225
I don't know.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.564
Who can figure it?

10:17.325 --> 10:20.408
- Are you cold, Pony?
- A little.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.167
Hey, listen, kiddo.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.501
Darry yells at you like that.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.925
He don't mean nothing.

10:39.139 --> 10:44.054
It's just that he got hit
with a lot of responsibilities

10:44.227 --> 10:47.560
after Mum and Dad died
he ain't used to.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.355
He loves you a lot.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.897
Sure.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.028
- Soda?
- Hm?

10:59.242 --> 11:02.655
- How come you dropped out of school?
- Cos I'm dumb.

11:03.580 --> 11:08.074
The only things I was passing
was automechanics and gym.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.367
- You're not dumb.
- Yeah, I am.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.795
Hey, you shut up,
and I'll tell you something, though.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.338
You gotta promise me
that you're not gonna tell Darry.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.922
All right.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.472
I think I'm gonna marry Sandy.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.928
I'll probably wait till
you're out of school, though,

11:30.106 --> 11:32.939
so I can help Darry
with the bills and stuff.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.901
Soda?

11:38.531 --> 11:41.864
- Soda, are you in love with Sandy?
- Mm-hm.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.656
What's it like?

11:48.625 --> 11:50.286
What's the time?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.585
It's real nice.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.510
<i>At just about midnight</i>

12:07.977 --> 12:10.218
<i>She makes me feel so good</i>

12:11.731 --> 12:13.517
<i>She makes me feel all right...</i>

12:16.110 --> 12:18.271
Hey, what's going on, Dal?
What's up?

12:19.948 --> 12:23.315
- We're early.
- What do you wanna do?

12:25.119 --> 12:26.780
Nothing legal, man. Let's get out.

12:26.955 --> 12:33.451
<i>G-L-O-R-l-A, Gloria</i>

12:33.628 --> 12:37.120
<i>I'm gonna shout loud it all night Gloria</i>

12:37.298 --> 12:40.210
<i>I'm gonna shout it every day Gloria</i>

12:40.385 --> 12:42.546
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...</i>

12:45.932 --> 12:47.672
How you doing, Joe?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.475
<i>Gloria</i>

12:59.654 --> 13:03.112
<i>G-L-O-R-l-A, Gloria</i>

13:03.283 --> 13:05.365
<i>I'm gonna shout it loud all night</i>

13:05.535 --> 13:06.820
<i>Gloria</i>

13:06.995 --> 13:08.531
<i>I'm gonna shout it every day</i>

13:08.705 --> 13:10.036
<i>Gloria</i>

13:10.206 --> 13:12.367
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah...</i>

13:17.463 --> 13:19.670
Hey, Soda, here come the hobos.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.923
Hey, Sodapop, I ain't got no cash.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.129
Anyone want to buy a windshield wiper?

13:24.304 --> 13:28.047
- Come on, Dally!
- Give them the money.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.135
So, what's the movie about?

13:31.152 --> 13:33.093
Dallas! Huh?

13:33.271 --> 13:36.013
I don't know, Johnny.
One of those beach movies.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.306
You know, they put out
a whole bunch of 'em.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.275
<i>At just about midnight</i>

13:43.239 --> 13:44.729
<i>She makes me feel so good...</i>

13:44.907 --> 13:47.444
Hey, did I say you guys
could play on my grass, huh?

13:47.618 --> 13:50.200
- No.
- Well, what are you doing here?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.237
Give me those cards, will you?

13:54.667 --> 13:57.909
<i>When she comes to my house...</i>

13:58.087 --> 14:00.019
You guys ever played 52 pick-up?

14:00.590 --> 14:02.376
What?

14:02.550 --> 14:04.336
Hey, don't get, don't get wise.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.754
I don't like little kids.
I don't like 'em. I just...

14:09.932 --> 14:13.675
<i>G-L-O-R-l-A, Gloria...</i>

14:13.853 --> 14:16.720
Get out of here,
or I'll kill you!

14:16.898 --> 14:19.264
<i>I'm gonna shout loud it all night Gloria...</i>

14:19.442 --> 14:20.898
Go!

14:21.069 --> 14:23.355
Get out of here, you little brats!

14:23.529 --> 14:27.192
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

14:27.367 --> 14:31.326
- The sky's getting dark. Let's go.
- Let's go, man.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.913
<i>Do you think Fanny
might have been right?</i>

14:36.084 --> 14:39.247
<i>Why are you always worried?
Any reason she should be?</i>

14:39.420 --> 14:41.832
<i>No reason at all.
For you either.</i>

14:42.006 --> 14:43.871
<i>Hey, Stella! Come here!</i>

14:49.472 --> 14:52.930
- What do you think you're doing?
- Cherry, just relax!

14:53.101 --> 14:56.013
I mean, just try.
You're supposed to be my girlfriend.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.644
Don't ever pull
anything like that again!

14:58.815 --> 15:03.058
Are you serious?
Don't do this to me, Cherry!

15:04.487 --> 15:06.102
I'm not going back there.

15:06.280 --> 15:10.364
- I don't understand! I mean...
- They wanna make things complicated.

15:19.627 --> 15:23.085
- Hey, Wayne, bring me a Coke!
- I don't have enough money!

15:25.174 --> 15:29.292
- Baby, you wanna see what's hanging?
- I'm gonna hang you, Two-Bit!

15:30.513 --> 15:32.549
Are you sure you wanna do this?

15:32.723 --> 15:35.055
I came here to see a movie,
and I'm gonna see a movie!

15:35.226 --> 15:36.386
I'm freezing, man!

15:36.561 --> 15:38.472
Why didn't you bring a coat, stupid?

15:38.646 --> 15:40.136
I forgot.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.108
Some cute redhead, huh?

15:56.706 --> 15:59.914
Are you a real redhead, huh?

16:00.084 --> 16:01.540
Come on, Dal.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.043
Are you real?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.639
How can I find out if this is your,
your, your real red hair?

16:19.812 --> 16:24.101
If this is the same red hair
that you have on your, your...

16:24.275 --> 16:27.233
These eyebrows here. Is it..?

16:31.740 --> 16:32.856
Cut it out, Dal.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.532
Get your feet off my chair,
and shut your trap!

16:42.710 --> 16:45.372
- Who's gonna make me, huh?
- I'm gonna get a Coke.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.958
- Who? Your boyfriend?
- Leave her alone, Dal.

16:48.132 --> 16:51.716
That's the Greaser who just got out
of some jail or something.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.672
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say, honey.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.677
Leave us alone,
or I'll call the cops.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.681
Oh, my, my!
You got me scared to death!

16:58.851 --> 17:01.934
What am I,
what am I gonna do now, Pony, huh?

17:02.104 --> 17:04.060
This girl’s making me shake!

17:05.107 --> 17:08.598
Why don't you leave us alone?
Be nice and leave us alone!

17:08.778 --> 17:10.268
I'm never nice.

17:11.446 --> 17:15.031
Can I interest you
in a Coca-Cola or a 7UP?

17:15.201 --> 17:16.781
Get lost, hood!

17:18.079 --> 17:19.694
Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't...

17:21.172 --> 17:22.784
I didn't know...

17:22.959 --> 17:26.917
I didn't know you had this problem with...
yelling in my face.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.547
OK. All right. I'll go.
I know when I'm not wanted.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.220
God! Your filthy Greaser!

17:51.779 --> 17:54.065
Are you gonna start on us now, too?

17:55.283 --> 17:56.523
No.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.534
You don't look the type, anyway.
What's your name?

17:59.704 --> 18:01.194
Ponyboy Curtis.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.910
That's an original name.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.580
Yeah, my dad, he was an original person.

18:08.754 --> 18:12.292
I got a brother named Sodapop.
It says so on his birth certificate.

18:14.719 --> 18:18.507
My name's Sherry, but my friends
call me Cherry cos of my hair.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.138
I know. We go to the same school.
You're a cheerleader.

18:21.309 --> 18:22.594
Yeah.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.259
You don't look old enough
to be going to high school.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.475
What's a nice boy like you
doing hanging around with that trash?

18:29.817 --> 18:32.559
Dally's my buddy.
I'm a Greaser, too.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.570
- We're all friends.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.

18:38.534 --> 18:42.368
Your brother, Sodapop, he works at
the gasoline station, right? At DX.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.778
Yeah, that's him.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.446
Yeah, Soda's the cute one!

18:45.625 --> 18:47.741
I should have known
you were brothers!

18:50.171 --> 18:53.334
Hey, how come we don't see
your brother at school any more?

18:54.425 --> 18:58.009
Has he been working full time
since your parents died?

18:58.179 --> 19:01.671
- He's a dropout.
- Oh, that's too bad.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.181
Here. I thought this might
cool you off.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.889
Maybe that will cool you off, Greaser!

19:11.067 --> 19:13.854
When you learn to talk and act decent,
I might cool off, too!

19:14.028 --> 19:15.609
Fiery, huh?
Just the way I like 'em!

19:15.780 --> 19:17.896
- Get off of me!
- Come on.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.281
Look, leave her alone, Dal.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.318
What did you say?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.488
Come on. You heard me.
Leave her alone.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.000
What did you say, you little shit?
What did you say?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.252
- Come on.
- You wise ass.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.173
Hey, wise guy, cool it, will you?

19:46.769 --> 19:48.305
Sit down, punk!

19:53.150 --> 19:54.686
Now you blew it.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.816
Thank you.
He had me scared to death.

19:56.987 --> 20:00.104
You sure didn't show it.
Nobody talks to Dal like that.

20:01.075 --> 20:03.361
From what I saw, you do.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.824
Why don't y'all come sit here with us
so you can protect us?

20:07.915 --> 20:10.873
- What do you think, man? Come on.
- Might as well.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.417
How old are y'all?

20:17.591 --> 20:19.297
- 14.
- 16.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.083
I thought you were both 14!

20:23.597 --> 20:26.839
How come y'all ain't scared of us
like you was of Dally?

20:27.017 --> 20:30.305
Oh, you two are too sweet-looking
to scare anyone.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.141
Besides, I know about Dallas Winston.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.981
You two don't look mean.

20:36.152 --> 20:39.986
Yeah, right.
We're young and innocent.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.989
No. You're just not dirty.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.445
Come on, Dal's OK.
I mean, he's tough and all.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.486
But he's a cool old guy,
if you get to know him.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.700
He'd leave you alone
if he knew who you were.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.834
- Well, I'm glad he doesn't know us.
- I kind of admire him.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.084
Oi, Greaser! You're dead!

20:59.258 --> 21:01.044
What's he doing?
Get out of my hair!

21:01.218 --> 21:03.675
Hey, what have you done?

21:03.846 --> 21:06.212
Here, kid, have a beer.
It'll settle your nerves.

21:06.390 --> 21:11.305
Well, now, who we got here?
Your great-grandmothers, huh?

21:11.479 --> 21:14.687
What are you two young ladies
hanging out with these Greasers?

21:14.857 --> 21:16.813
Dal was bothering them.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.099
- He was, huh?
- Yeah.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.268
Where is old Dal now anyway?

21:21.906 --> 21:23.271
Yeah, where is old Dally?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.570
He left, Tim.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.700
Hey, I know he slashed my tyres!

21:32.792 --> 21:35.158
Look, Tim, he left.
He's not here. Really.

21:35.336 --> 21:37.998
- You guys seen Dally?
- No, no.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.710
Yeah, well, I'll be looking for him.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.838
- Dally got a blade?
- I don't think so.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.723
Good deal. Tim will fight fair
as long as he don't.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.728
You guys don't believe in playing rough,
do you?

21:56.899 --> 22:00.357
- Well, a fair fight ain't rough.
- Yeah, boy. Real simple!

22:00.528 --> 22:04.612
Yeah! If he gets killed or something,
you just bury him. No sweat!

22:06.325 --> 22:10.409
- You dig, OK, baby. You want a chew?
- Come on, Two-Bit.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.570
Help yourself.
Put hair on your chest!

22:14.208 --> 22:16.915
Ponyboy, come with me
and get some Cokes and popcorn.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.496
Sure.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.161
- Y'all want some?
- I do.

22:20.339 --> 22:24.048
Yeah, me, too.
Get Johnny some, too. I'm buying.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.458
Here you go.

22:27.888 --> 22:31.096
Your friend, the one with the sideburns,
is he OK?

22:31.267 --> 22:33.974
Yeah, he ain't dangerous,
if that's what you mean.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.224
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hey, man!

22:38.899 --> 22:40.685
He sure scared Johnny.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.227
Johnny's a nervous wreck anyway.

22:44.405 --> 22:47.693
He got beat up a few months ago
by some Soc.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.442
Is that how he got his scar?

22:51.620 --> 22:53.702
Yeah, the guy was wearing a few rings.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.665
- Not all of us are like that.
- Sure.

22:58.836 --> 23:02.294
That's like saying all you Greasers
are like Dallas Winston.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.830
- Leave him, will you?
- What you gonna do about it?

23:05.009 --> 23:07.546
Let's take it outside.
That's what I'll do.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.212
All right, you two.
Why don't you both take it outside?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.802
Well, he's jumped a few people.

23:14.727 --> 23:18.515
Anyway, you think the Socs
have it made.

23:18.689 --> 23:22.432
The rich kids. The southside Soc.

23:22.610 --> 23:25.067
Well, I'll tell you something, Ponyboy,

23:25.237 --> 23:29.150
and it might come as a surprise,
but things are rough all over.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.276
Come on. Let's get out of here.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.661
Or Two-Bit will think
we eloped to Mexico!

23:37.458 --> 23:40.416
- So, you're from the southside, huh?
- Yes.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.419
- It must be a nice neighbourhood.
- It is. I like it.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.125
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

23:45.299 --> 23:48.257
Yeah, I'm...
I'm from the other side of town.

24:10.157 --> 24:14.196
Tell me about your oldest brother.
You never seem to talk about him.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.782
What's to tell?

24:16.956 --> 24:19.117
He's big and roofs houses.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.373
No, really. I mean, what's he like?

24:21.543 --> 24:24.034
I feel like I know Soda
for as much as you talk about him.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.704
Tell me about Darry.
Is he wild and reckless like Soda?

24:26.882 --> 24:28.873
Or dreamy like you?

24:31.261 --> 24:34.173
He ain't like Soda,
and he sure ain't like me!

24:34.348 --> 24:36.179
He can't stand me!

24:37.476 --> 24:41.264
I bet he wishes he could stick me
in some boys' home. Soda won't let him.

24:41.438 --> 24:44.680
- What are you talking about?
- Come on. You all get along fine.

24:44.858 --> 24:48.316
No, we don't! You shut your trap,
cos you ain't wanted at home either!

24:48.487 --> 24:49.977
You shut your mouth, kid!

24:51.323 --> 24:53.279
I'm sorry. I got a little mad.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.281
Don't worry about it.

24:55.452 --> 24:58.740
- We couldn't get along without you.
- Marcia!

24:58.914 --> 25:01.621
- Look who's coming!
- What are we gonna do?

25:01.792 --> 25:04.659
- Just act normal. Just keep calm.
- Who are these clowns?

25:06.839 --> 25:08.545
Cherry, what's going on?

25:08.716 --> 25:10.331
What are you doing?

25:12.594 --> 25:14.630
Just because we got a little drunk...

25:14.805 --> 25:17.968
You call reeling and passing out
on the streets "a little"?

25:18.142 --> 25:19.427
Bob, I've told you before,

25:19.601 --> 25:22.343
I'm never going out with you
when you're drinking!

25:22.521 --> 25:25.354
That's no reason to go walking the streets
with these bums!

25:25.524 --> 25:27.480
- Who are you calling bums, pal?
- You!

25:27.651 --> 25:30.484
- Randy!
- We got two more in the back seat.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.862
- Pity the back seat!
- If you're looking for a fight...

25:34.033 --> 25:37.116
I am looking for a fight!
Let's go! Come on! Right not!

25:37.286 --> 25:38.776
Come on!

25:38.954 --> 25:41.115
All right! We'll go with you!
Just wait a minute!

25:41.290 --> 25:45.374
- We ain't scared of these bastards!
- I hate fights! I hate 'em!

25:46.336 --> 25:47.951
Come here, Ponyboy.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.166
I'm sorry.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.426
Look, I couldn't use this.
I could never cut no one.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.053
Cherry! Come on!

25:58.223 --> 26:00.179
We'd better go with 'em.

26:05.731 --> 26:09.349
If I see you in school and I don't say hi,
don't take it personal, OK?

26:09.526 --> 26:11.062
Yeah, I know.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.818
Really. You're a nice boy and everything.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.525
It's OK.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.404
I hope I never see Dallas Winston again.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.119
If I do,
I'll probably fall in love with him.

26:26.293 --> 26:28.079
- Come on, baby.
- Don't touch me!

26:29.922 --> 26:31.753
<i>Blue moon</i>

26:31.924 --> 26:36.338
<i>You saw me standing alone</i>

26:37.554 --> 26:39.010
<i>Without a dream in my heart...</i>

26:39.181 --> 26:43.140
- Just watch it, greaseball.
- Says who?

26:43.310 --> 26:45.141
<i>Without a love of my own...</i>

26:45.312 --> 26:47.849
Boy, those are two of the
best-looking girls I've ever seen.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.973
Yeah.

26:55.823 --> 26:58.235
- What was that?
- Marcia's number.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.864
Probably a phoney one, too.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.321
I must have been out of my mind
to ask for it.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.703
Girl like that would never
go out with me, anyway.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.363
Where are y'all going?

27:06.542 --> 27:07.907
- Home.
- Whoa!

27:09.211 --> 27:10.951
Here! I got me a new hat!

27:13.882 --> 27:15.588
You're crazy!

27:15.759 --> 27:19.422
I don't why I handed you that busted bottle.
You never would have used it.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.507
I might have. Where you headed?

27:21.682 --> 27:24.424
I don't know.
Maybe I'll go play snooker or get drunk.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.432
- I'll see you later!
- OK!

27:28.147 --> 27:31.184
I hate when my folks are fighting.
Let's go to the lot.

27:36.738 --> 27:40.401
<i>Blue moon</i>

27:40.576 --> 27:43.033
<i>You saw me standing alone...</i>

27:43.203 --> 27:45.285
It was because we're Greasers, Pone.

27:47.749 --> 27:50.741
Might have hurt her reputation
or something, that's all.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.830
Don't worry about it.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.791
Yeah, I guess so.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.099
Man, that was a tough car, huh?

28:10.522 --> 28:13.559
Mustangs, they're tough.

28:14.735 --> 28:16.851
Big-time Socs, all right.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.857
It's always the same.

28:22.034 --> 28:26.403
<i>Blue moon</i>

28:31.460 --> 28:35.624
<i>You saw me standing alone...</i>

28:35.797 --> 28:38.539
I can't take much more of this, Ponyboy!

28:38.717 --> 28:41.925
I'll... I'll kill myself or something!
I don't know!

28:43.764 --> 28:47.348
Don't talk like that, Johnny.
Come on. You can't kill yourself.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.726
I've gotta do something.

28:52.981 --> 28:56.348
Oh, God. It seems...

29:03.158 --> 29:08.243
It seems like there's gotta be someplace
without Greasers and Socs.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.947
There must be someplace...

29:14.127 --> 29:18.120
with just plain ordinary people.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.004
People.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.509
It's like that out in the country.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.176
Away from all the big towns.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.177
Out in the country.

29:35.607 --> 29:42.445
<i>If today was not an endless highway</i>

29:44.533 --> 29:50.995
<i>If tonight was not an endless trail...</i>

30:00.048 --> 30:01.754
<i>Ponyboy!</i>

30:01.925 --> 30:03.756
Pony, wake up!

30:03.927 --> 30:05.292
Come on!

30:06.054 --> 30:07.669
God! What time is it?

30:07.848 --> 30:10.089
I don't know.
I went to sleep, too.

30:12.686 --> 30:14.642
You better get home, all right?

30:14.813 --> 30:18.397
I'm gonna stay all night out here.
Who'll care anyway?

30:19.401 --> 30:21.608
All right.
If you get cold, come on to my house.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.643
Yeah, all right.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.938
What is Darry gonna say?

30:38.086 --> 30:41.078
Yeah, it's Darry.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.212
Yeah. Bye.

30:48.138 --> 30:50.880
Where the hell have you been?
Do you know what time it is?

30:51.058 --> 30:53.140
It's two o'clock in the morning, kiddo.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.471
- Where have you been?
- I feel asleep in the lot.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.385
- You what?!
- I was talking to Johnny.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.101
And I fell asleep in the lot.
I didn't mean to.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.891
And I can't even call the cops

31:03.070 --> 31:05.561
because you two would be thrown
in boys' home so fast,

31:05.739 --> 31:07.104
it would make your head spin!

31:07.282 --> 31:10.490
- Come on, Pony. Let's go to bed now.
- Look, I said I didn't mean to!

31:10.660 --> 31:13.493
"I didn't mean to!" "I forgot."
That's all I ever hear from you.

31:13.663 --> 31:16.700
- Come on, Darry...
- Tired of you sticking up for him!

31:16.875 --> 31:19.912
Don't you yell at him!

31:20.087 --> 31:22.874
Ponyboy! I didn't mean to!

31:37.813 --> 31:40.429
Come on, Johnny!
Move out of the way!

31:52.953 --> 31:56.821
Take it easy, Pony. It will be all right.
You just have to cool it, man.

31:56.998 --> 31:59.865
Got a cigarette, Johnny?
I'm scared to death.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.876
Well, don't be, man.
You're scaring me.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.833
- What happened?
- Darry hit me!

32:06.007 --> 32:08.623
I swear we used to get along fine
until Mum and Dad died.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.758
Now he can't stand me!

32:10.929 --> 32:13.466
I think I like it better
when the old man's hitting me.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.551
At least he knows I'm there.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.472
Let's walk to the park and back.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.978
Maybe I'll cool off enough to go home.

32:22.149 --> 32:25.892
Yeah, all right.
Ain't you about to freeze to death?

32:27.362 --> 32:29.023
You're ain't a' woofin'.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.633
Pony!

33:04.191 --> 33:06.022
Pony, got a light?

33:07.027 --> 33:09.063
Found this butt, man.

33:09.237 --> 33:11.569
Yeah, here you go, Johnny.

33:13.966 --> 33:15.402
Look what's coming.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.076
This is our territory.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.237
I bet they're looking for us.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.041
- Wanna split?
- Stay cool.

33:27.047 --> 33:31.882
Well, well, well.
What do you guys know?

33:32.052 --> 33:33.508
They're drunk.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.512
It's that guy with the rings, man.

33:38.683 --> 33:43.768
Aren't these the Greasers
who tried to pick up our women?

33:44.606 --> 33:47.313
You guys are out of your territory.
You better watch it.

33:47.484 --> 33:48.974
No, pal. You better watch it.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.871
You guys know what Greasers are?

34:03.041 --> 34:05.783
White trash with long greasy hair.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.793
- You know what a Soc is?
- What?

34:17.973 --> 34:20.965
White trash with Mustangs and madras.

34:21.141 --> 34:22.348
Get 'em!

34:29.234 --> 34:30.313
Johnny!

34:32.828 --> 34:34.313
Stay down, pal!

34:34.489 --> 34:35.603
Chuck him!

34:48.878 --> 34:51.369
Grab his arms! Right down!

34:55.217 --> 34:58.631
Did somebody get a drink
for this Greaser, huh?

34:58.805 --> 35:01.638
Come on! Have a drink, pal!

35:57.364 --> 36:00.731
I... I... I killed him.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.737
I killed that boy.

36:09.334 --> 36:10.744
I killed him.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.714
Johnny, I think I'm gonna be sick!

36:25.266 --> 36:27.973
Go ahead, man.
I ain't... I ain't gonna look at you.

36:28.144 --> 36:29.850
Ain't gonna look at you.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.064
Pony, are you all right?

36:46.413 --> 36:48.654
You really did kill 'em, huh, Johnny?

36:51.459 --> 36:53.040
Yeah.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.499
I had to.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.209
They, they were drowning you,
and they might have killed you!

37:06.683 --> 37:08.344
They were gonna beat me up!

37:10.145 --> 37:12.978
- What happened to the other guys?
- Huh?

37:16.109 --> 37:18.725
They... they all ran.
They all ran off.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.110
When I stabbed him, they all ran.

37:54.563 --> 37:55.554
What do you boys want?

37:55.732 --> 38:00.442
- Dally. W-w-w-we gotta see Dally.
- He's busy.

38:00.612 --> 38:04.070
Just tell him it's Ponyboy and Johnny, man!
He'll come!

38:05.909 --> 38:07.399
Come on!

38:25.553 --> 38:27.635
What do you guys want?

38:27.806 --> 38:30.513
- Johnny killed the Socs.
- What?

38:31.976 --> 38:34.433
All right. Good for you.
Let's go.

38:34.604 --> 38:37.141
We figured you could get us out,
if anyone could, Dal.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.899
I... I'm sorry I got you away
from this party and all,

38:41.069 --> 38:43.151
but I just don't know
what to do, man.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.027
I was just trying to get some sleep.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.154
I got into a fight with Shepard tonight.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.067
Let's see what we can do about this mess.
Get in.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.577
- Ponyboy, are you wet?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.412
Hey, hey! Pony, come on, man.

38:59.629 --> 39:02.462
You'll die of pneumonia
before the cops ever get to you!

39:07.554 --> 39:09.465
Come on.

39:09.639 --> 39:12.756
Hey, stupid, take the sweatshirt off,
will you, man?

39:12.934 --> 39:14.515
You'll freeze to death.

39:16.729 --> 39:18.685
Man, I wish I had a weed now.

39:22.902 --> 39:26.019
Here. Don't point the thing at me,
will you?

39:26.197 --> 39:27.812
It's loaded. Come on.

39:34.747 --> 39:36.453
Here you go. That's 50 bucks.

39:36.624 --> 39:40.037
Look, I'm not gonna tell your brother
and get my head kicked in, man.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.917
Then don't tell him!

39:42.839 --> 39:45.831
Here. It's Buck's. It's big on you,
but it's dry. Come here.

39:50.805 --> 39:54.013
Get the 3.15 train to Windrixville.
It's a freight.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.972
There's an abandoned church
on top of Jay Mountain.

39:59.314 --> 40:02.772
There's a pump in the back,
so you don't have to worry about water.

40:06.195 --> 40:08.902
Get a week's supply of food,
as soon as you get there,

40:09.073 --> 40:11.530
before the story gets out.

40:15.622 --> 40:19.080
And then don't so much as stick your noses
out the door. Am I clear?

40:19.250 --> 40:20.786
Yeah.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.576
I'll be up there
as soon as I think everything's cool.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.542
Hey, relax, buddy.
Come on, man. It'll work out.

40:28.343 --> 40:29.753
All right.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.800
Man, I thought New York
was the only place

40:34.974 --> 40:36.259
I'd end up in a murder wrap.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.299
Jesus Christ!

40:49.906 --> 40:52.022
OK, you take care, kid.
Good luck.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.913
<i>Train arrive</i>

41:05.088 --> 41:07.420
<i>16 coaches long...</i>

41:07.590 --> 41:10.206
- Let's check the other car.
- Yeah.

41:11.052 --> 41:14.510
<i>Train arrive</i>

41:15.139 --> 41:18.472
<i>16 coaches long</i>

41:20.395 --> 41:22.977
<i>Well, that long black train</i>

41:23.147 --> 41:25.980
<i>Got my baby and gone</i>

41:29.070 --> 41:32.187
<i>Train, train</i>

41:33.157 --> 41:35.990
<i>Coming round the bend...</i>

41:39.122 --> 41:41.955
<i>Train, train</i>

41:43.126 --> 41:45.913
<i>Coming round the bend</i>

41:48.214 --> 41:51.001
<i>Well, it took my baby</i>

41:51.175 --> 41:53.882
<i>But it never will again</i>

41:57.098 --> 41:59.635
<i>Train, train</i>

42:01.185 --> 42:03.597
<i>Coming down, down the line</i>

42:07.171 --> 42:09.186
<i>Train, train...</i>

42:11.738 --> 42:13.729
Wait up, man! Wait up!

42:23.082 --> 42:26.040
- Well?
- Well, what?

42:26.210 --> 42:28.246
Well, go and ask 'em.
Ask 'em where we are.

42:28.421 --> 42:30.662
The story won't be in the paper yet.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.831
Why don't you go ask 'em?

42:33.009 --> 42:35.375
My ankles hurt,
and I don't wanna walk on 'em.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.086
What am I gonna say?

42:38.264 --> 42:41.677
Just act like a farm boy taking a walk.
They'll never know.

42:43.686 --> 42:46.018
Do I look like a farm boy to you?

42:46.189 --> 42:47.599
Just ask 'em...

42:47.774 --> 42:51.813
Ask 'em where... Jay Mountain is.
Don't worry about it.

42:51.986 --> 42:54.568
They're gonna know who I am
as soon as they look at me.

42:54.739 --> 42:57.446
They're not gonna know! Come on!

43:05.124 --> 43:08.833
Excuse me. Can you tell me
the way to Jay Mountain?

43:09.003 --> 43:11.244
- Huh?
- How could I get to Jay Mountain?

43:11.422 --> 43:15.381
Follow this road up to that hill.
That's it.

43:15.551 --> 43:17.667
- Thank you.
- Taking a walk?

43:19.680 --> 43:23.719
Y-y-yeah. We're playing Army.
I was supposed to report to headquarters.

43:27.355 --> 43:29.311
Boys will be boys!

43:34.862 --> 43:37.103
Check it out, man.

43:37.281 --> 43:38.691
The church.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.652
<i>Well, there's a leak
in this old building</i>

43:44.372 --> 43:48.866
<i>Yeah, there's a leak
in this old building</i>

43:49.043 --> 43:53.537
<i>Well, there's a leak
in this old building</i>

43:53.714 --> 43:58.253
<i>We're gonna move to a better home</i>

43:58.427 --> 44:02.466
<i>We got no pane
in this old window</i>

44:03.057 --> 44:04.593
<i>We got no pane
in this old window</i>

44:07.812 --> 44:12.306
<i>We got no pane
in this old window</i>

44:12.483 --> 44:16.897
<i>We're gonna move to a better home</i>

44:17.071 --> 44:22.316
<i>Well, there's a hole in the roof
where the rain pours in</i>

44:22.493 --> 44:26.111
<i>A hole in the floor
where it drops right out again</i>

44:26.289 --> 44:30.123
<i>Well, there's a leak
in this old building</i>

44:31.002 --> 44:34.165
<i>Well, there's a leak
in this old building</i>

44:35.631 --> 44:39.590
<i>Well, there's a leak
in this old building</i>

44:40.428 --> 44:43.420
<i>We're gonna move to a better</i>

44:43.598 --> 44:48.137
<i>Move to a better</i>

44:48.978 --> 44:50.514
<i>Home</i>

44:52.231 --> 44:54.813
- What was that?
- Just an owl.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.381
Johnny?

45:21.552 --> 45:23.042
Yeah?

45:24.680 --> 45:26.420
You all right?

45:36.943 --> 45:38.979
Man, this floor sure is hard.

45:41.155 --> 45:47.151
<i>I can't see my reflection
in the water...</i>

45:47.328 --> 45:49.410
School day! Rise and shine!

45:49.580 --> 45:54.870
<i>I can't speak the sounds
that show no pain...</i>

45:55.044 --> 45:57.376
Come on, kiddo!
Wake up! Wake up!

45:58.923 --> 46:02.131
<i>I can't hear the echo
of my footsteps...</i>

46:02.301 --> 46:04.007
It's time to get up!

46:07.723 --> 46:09.338
Johnny?

46:55.646 --> 46:59.059
Hey, Johnny!
Fancy... Fancy meeting you here!

46:59.233 --> 47:01.565
You're acting more like Two-Bit
every day, huh?

47:01.736 --> 47:03.943
Who's acting? What did you get?

47:04.113 --> 47:07.025
Let's go inside, man.
Dally told us to stay inside.

47:10.453 --> 47:13.411
Right, I got a loaf of bread,

47:13.581 --> 47:16.288
and a week's supply of baloney here.

47:17.585 --> 47:18.870
Peanut butter.

47:20.087 --> 47:21.748
"Gone With The Wind"?

47:21.922 --> 47:24.504
How did you know I always wanted
"Gone With The Wind"

47:24.675 --> 47:27.041
I remember you saying something
about it once.

47:27.219 --> 47:29.460
Me and you went to see that movie, remember?

47:29.638 --> 47:32.425
I thought maybe you could read it out loud.
Help kill time.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.340
Thanks a lot, Johnny.

47:36.896 --> 47:38.557
- Cigarettes.
- A deck of cards.

47:42.943 --> 47:44.524
Peroxide?

47:49.825 --> 47:52.441
- You ain't thinking...
- We're gonna cut our hair, Ponyboy.

47:52.620 --> 47:53.860
You're gonna bleach yours.

47:54.038 --> 47:56.074
We can't fit descriptions
in the newspaper.

47:56.248 --> 47:58.489
No, sir.
You ain't gonna touch my hair.

47:58.667 --> 48:00.373
You have to anyway, if we got caught.

48:00.544 --> 48:03.160
The first thing the judge does
is make you get a haircut.

48:03.339 --> 48:05.330
- I don't see why.
- I don't either.

48:05.508 --> 48:07.544
It's just the way
they're trying to break us.

48:07.718 --> 48:10.505
I'm gonna cut mine off, too,
and wash all the grease out.

48:10.679 --> 48:14.092
- No, you ain't touching my hair.
- Ponyboy, it's gonna grow back, man.

48:14.266 --> 48:15.847
It's not that it won't.

48:17.228 --> 48:18.889
Go ahead.

48:29.490 --> 48:30.479
Sorry, man.

48:32.535 --> 48:33.775
<i>Gotta confess</i>

48:33.953 --> 48:35.989
<i>My hair is a mess...</i>

48:39.250 --> 48:40.740
Damn knife.

48:41.836 --> 48:44.543
- Don't pull so hard.
- Quit gabbing!

48:47.090 --> 48:48.331
Sorry, man.

48:48.509 --> 48:51.876
- Can I see now?
- No. You gotta bleach it first.

48:52.054 --> 48:54.340
Well, then bleach it.
Quit cutting.

48:54.515 --> 48:57.257
Hey, Pony, this'll do it.

49:01.021 --> 49:02.477
Here.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.975
Jesus!
This really makes me look tough!

49:13.075 --> 49:16.192
All right, go ahead.
Get your jollies.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.782
- My pleasure!
- Yeah, I know it is.

49:20.166 --> 49:23.875
<i>Lend me your comb,
it's time to go home...</i>

49:24.044 --> 49:25.705
Nice.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.087
<i>Gotta confess</i>

49:28.257 --> 49:29.372
<i>My hair is a mess</i>

49:29.550 --> 49:31.757
- Hurts, don't it?
- Yeah, yeah.

49:31.927 --> 49:34.339
Come on, man!
I didn't cut that much off of you!

49:34.513 --> 49:36.300
It was your bright idea, smarty.

49:46.275 --> 49:48.186
I'm still tired.

49:50.905 --> 49:53.772
Look, I'm sorry
I cut your hair off, Ponyboy.

49:53.949 --> 49:55.564
Well, it ain't that.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.533
It's just...

49:59.663 --> 50:01.824
I don't know. I'm all mixed up!

50:03.375 --> 50:04.911
Yeah, I know.

50:05.794 --> 50:07.910
Things have been happening so fast, huh?

50:13.010 --> 50:15.672
Man, you know that
one-horse store this morning?

50:15.846 --> 50:19.088
Two-Bit, he could have walked out
with half of that thing.

50:20.643 --> 50:22.179
Old Two-Bit, huh?

50:26.148 --> 50:28.685
Remember how he was wisecracking
last night?

50:31.737 --> 50:35.400
Just last night we was walking Cherry
and Marcia home from the movies.

50:37.701 --> 50:40.943
Just last night we was laying up
in the lot looking at the stars.

50:41.121 --> 50:43.578
Stop it, man!
Will you shut up about last night?

50:45.501 --> 50:48.993
- Johnny!
- I killed a kid last night.

50:49.171 --> 50:53.164
He couldn't have been more than 17,
maybe 18 years old, and I killed him!

50:53.342 --> 50:55.549
How would you like
to live with that, huh?

50:57.137 --> 50:58.968
I didn't mean to.

50:59.139 --> 51:02.051
They was drowning you,
and I didn't know what to do.

51:09.525 --> 51:12.232
There sure is a lot of blood
inside of people.

51:18.909 --> 51:20.649
What are we gonna do?

51:21.662 --> 51:26.201
Oh, man! It's all my fault,
bringing a 13-year-old kid along!

51:26.375 --> 51:27.740
You ought to go home, Ponyboy!

51:27.918 --> 51:30.455
You can't get into any trouble.
You didn't go kill him!

51:30.629 --> 51:34.167
No! I'm 14 and I've been 14 for a month!

51:34.341 --> 51:36.423
And I'm in this
just as much as you are!

51:36.594 --> 51:39.381
I'll stop crying in a minute.
I can't help it.

51:39.555 --> 51:41.420
I didn't mean it like that, Ponyboy.

51:43.225 --> 51:44.840
Hey, don't cry.

51:45.686 --> 51:47.347
Don't cry, man.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.429
It'll be all right.

51:51.525 --> 51:53.265
It'll be fine.

51:57.698 --> 51:59.939
Let's just...
Let's go by the fire, all right?

52:44.745 --> 52:47.612
- Johnny, are you awake?
- Yeah.

52:50.209 --> 52:52.165
There's a monster outside.

52:53.253 --> 52:54.538
What?

52:57.132 --> 52:59.168
We're gonna be OK, Ponyboy.

53:02.930 --> 53:06.798
<i>Yes, I'm gonna walk
on that milky white way...</i>

53:06.975 --> 53:10.217
"Lying in the pit of the sun,
shoulder to shoulder, head to feet,

53:10.396 --> 53:13.513
"were hundreds of wounded men
lying in the tracks, the sidewalks,

53:13.691 --> 53:17.309
"stretched out in endless rows,
under the car shed.

53:18.821 --> 53:22.985
"Some lay stiff and still,
but many withered in the hot sun.

53:24.952 --> 53:27.364
"Everywhere swarms of flies
hovered over the men

53:27.538 --> 53:29.699
"crawling and buzzing in their faces."

53:29.873 --> 53:31.079
Man, that's gross!

53:31.250 --> 53:34.208
"Everywhere was blood,
dirty bandages, groans,

53:34.378 --> 53:36.289
"screamed curses of pain.

53:40.759 --> 53:42.499
"But for four years,
she had seen others

53:42.678 --> 53:44.669
"who had refused to recognise defeat.

53:44.847 --> 53:47.088
"Men who rode gaily into sure disaster,

53:47.266 --> 53:49.131
"because they were gallant."

53:50.686 --> 53:52.176
Pretty cool, huh?

53:54.314 --> 53:55.770
Gallant.

53:57.151 --> 53:58.982
The cool old guys
remind me of Dally.

53:59.153 --> 54:02.896
Dally? Shoot, he ain't got
no more manners than I do.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.864
Soda's more like them southern boys.

54:07.286 --> 54:09.072
Yeah, the manners bit.

54:09.830 --> 54:11.570
Charm, too, I guess, but...

54:13.375 --> 54:17.835
- Dallas...
- Dallas so really scares me.

54:19.381 --> 54:20.837
Come on. Read on.

54:25.888 --> 54:27.924
Watch your smoke, Johnny.

54:36.190 --> 54:39.148
<i>One morning,
I woke up earlier than usual.</i>

54:39.318 --> 54:41.775
<i>The church was colder than ever.</i>

54:54.416 --> 54:57.123
Golly. That was sure pretty, huh?

54:57.294 --> 54:58.955
Yeah.

55:00.380 --> 55:02.666
It's like the mist is what's pretty,
you know.

55:02.841 --> 55:04.581
All gold and silver.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.625
Mm-hm.

55:07.888 --> 55:10.675
Too bad it can't stay like that
all the time.

55:12.518 --> 55:14.383
"Nothing Gold Can Stay".

55:14.937 --> 55:16.802
Huh?

55:16.980 --> 55:19.346
"Nature's first green is gold

55:19.900 --> 55:21.982
"Her hardest hue to hold

55:24.655 --> 55:27.237
"Her early leaf's a flower

55:28.700 --> 55:30.861
"But only so an hour

55:32.538 --> 55:34.904
"Then leaf subsides to leaf

55:36.166 --> 55:38.657
"So Eden sank to grief

55:40.754 --> 55:43.245
"So dawn goes down today

55:44.925 --> 55:47.667
"Nothing gold can stay."

55:50.264 --> 55:53.347
Where did you learn that?
That's what I meant.

55:54.601 --> 55:56.808
Robert Frost wrote it.

55:56.979 --> 55:59.891
I remembered it, cos I never
quite knew what he meant by it.

56:00.065 --> 56:01.305
Hm.

56:03.193 --> 56:06.276
You know, I never noticed colours,
clouds and stuff

56:06.446 --> 56:08.186
until you kept reminding me about them.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.572
It's kind of like
they were never there before.

56:11.743 --> 56:13.279
Yeah.

56:14.371 --> 56:17.909
I don't think I could ever
tell Steve or Two-Bit or even Darry

56:18.083 --> 56:20.290
about the clouds and sunset.

56:21.753 --> 56:23.709
Just you and Sodapop.

56:25.048 --> 56:26.333
Maybe Cherry Valance.

56:26.508 --> 56:28.999
I guess we're different, huh?

56:29.177 --> 56:32.340
Shoot, kid. Maybe they are.

56:32.514 --> 56:33.924
Maybe you're right.

57:23.023 --> 57:24.105
Hey, blondie!

57:25.275 --> 57:27.231
- Hey, Dal.
- Wake up.

57:28.070 --> 57:30.777
- How you been?
- Hey, Johnny, rise and shine, man!

57:30.948 --> 57:33.109
- How's Soda doing?
- Hey, Dallas! How are you?

57:33.283 --> 57:35.319
- Is he upset?
- Are the fuzz after us?

57:35.494 --> 57:39.362
Wait. One thing at a time.
Are you guys hungry? I'm starving, man.

57:39.539 --> 57:41.746
You're starving?
Try baloney for four days!

57:43.377 --> 57:46.084
- You got a cancer stick, Johnny?
- Yeah.

57:49.675 --> 57:54.135
I got a special delivery for...
a Ponyboy Curtis.

57:54.304 --> 57:56.545
- For you, man.
- Who's this from?

57:57.432 --> 57:59.798
The president of the United States of America.

57:59.977 --> 58:02.434
- Yeah, right!
- I'm serious, man.

58:02.604 --> 58:04.890
From your brother, Sodapop.

58:05.065 --> 58:06.896
How did he know I was here?

58:08.777 --> 58:11.484
I told him where you were,
but he didn't believe me.

58:11.655 --> 58:13.941
He really wanted me
to give that to you, man.

58:14.116 --> 58:16.448
<i>I guess you got into some trouble, huh?</i>

58:16.618 --> 58:20.452
<i>Darry's awfully sorry he hit you.
You know he didn't mean it.</i>

58:20.622 --> 58:23.989
<i>Dallas got hauled into the station,
and scared us something awful.</i>

58:24.167 --> 58:27.580
<i>And I wish you'd come back
and turn yourselves in.</i>

58:27.754 --> 58:28.960
<i>We miss you.</i>

58:29.131 --> 58:32.965
<i>Say hi to Johnny for us.
Sodapop Curtis.</i>

58:35.846 --> 58:38.383
Dal, what's going on with the cops?
Did you hear anything?

58:38.557 --> 58:40.138
How come you got hauled in?

58:40.308 --> 58:42.765
Those boys down at the station
know me by now.

58:44.855 --> 58:48.689
While I was there,
they beat it out of me that you guys were...

58:48.859 --> 58:51.726
Get this one.
That you guys were headed for Texas, man.

58:51.903 --> 58:53.393
They think you guys are in Texas.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.692
Texas, man! God!

58:58.827 --> 59:01.739
Look at this guy with his hair, man.
I can't believe that.

59:05.459 --> 59:06.744
Blondie, man.

59:06.918 --> 59:09.955
I know I look lousy,
but don't rub it in.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.122
You guys wanna get something to eat?

59:14.301 --> 59:17.384
Hey, you better believe it!
Let's get out of here.

59:17.554 --> 59:20.762
Where did you get this car? Huh?

59:20.932 --> 59:23.048
- It's Buck's.
- Dal, don't!

59:23.226 --> 59:24.807
- Watch it!
- I got it.

59:25.771 --> 59:28.478
- What are you doing?
- Don't, Dal! Watch it!

59:29.274 --> 59:31.811
I hope you guys are in the mood
for barbecue, man.

59:31.985 --> 59:33.941
- Jerk!
- Trying to kill us?

59:34.112 --> 59:38.947
Can we have three barbecue sandwiches,
three Cokes and a...?

59:44.748 --> 59:46.704
You guys really are hungry, huh?

59:47.834 --> 59:50.621
That kid you killed
had plenty of friends.

59:50.796 --> 59:53.208
It's all over town -
Soc against Grease.

59:54.007 --> 59:57.716
- Look, I started carrying a heater.
- Dal, you kill people with heaters.

59:57.886 --> 59:59.877
Don't worry. It ain't loaded.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:03.343
Hey, mister, do you have 15 cents?

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.724
Nah, I don't have any money, man.

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:08.431
- Are you sure?
- Could you go away? We're busy here.

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:11.062
- Do you have a dime?
- Could you go away?

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:13.815
- Do you have a dime?
- Go away! Get out of here!

01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:17.436
That was a close call.

01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:24.027
Tim Shepard's gang and our outfit
are gonna have it out with the Socs

01:00:24.104 --> 01:00:26.195
in a vacant lot tomorrow night.

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:29.410
Hey, I didn't tell you we got a spy.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:30.824
A spy? Who?

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:33.744
Remember that good-looking broad
I tried to pick up

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:36.129
the night you wasted that kid?

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:40.542
What's her name?
Uh, Cherry something... The redhead?

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.883
- Cherry Valance!
- Cherry, the Soc. Yeah.

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:46.298
Yeah, we were hanging out
down at a vacant lot,

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.683
and she pulls up
in a little old Stinger, right?

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:51.971
- I thought that took a lot of nerve.
- Yeah.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:56.233
She said that she'd testify
that the Socs were drunk,

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.644
and they were the ones
looking for the fight.

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:01.689
And you guys just fought back
strictly on self-defence.

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:03.107
So, it's cool.

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:07.076
Man, that little broad
sure does hate me.

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:10.489
I offered to take her for a Coke,
and she told me to go to hell.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:11.952
I don't know.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:14.284
Yeah.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:17.371
So you think she might
like me a little bit?

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:20.507
Huh? I think she's kinda cute.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:24.002
- No?
- Right.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:27.048
What do they do for kicks around here?
Play checkers?

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:28.840
This place is out of it.

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:35.604
I've never been to the country before.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.515
We're gonna turn ourselves in.

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:39.768
What? What?

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:41.811
I got a good chance
of being let off easy.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.528
It was self-defence. You just said.
Pony and Cherry could testify.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:46.942
We won't say you helped us.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.283
I'll give you back that gun.
You won't get into any trouble, Dal.

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:52.368
- Are you sure this is what you want?
- Yeah.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:55.909
It ain't fair for Darry and Soda
to worry about Ponyboy all the time.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:01.207
- I guess my folks aren't worrying.
- Hey, man, the boys are worried!

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.796
Two-Bit wanted to go to Texas
to hunt for you!

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.507
Dallas, I asked if my parents
asked about me.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:08.137
No, they didn't! So what?

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:10.094
Do you think my old man gives a hang

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:13.681
if I'm dead in a car wreck
or drunk or in jail or something?

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:17.222
He doesn't care!
But that doesn't bother me none!

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:22.690
Come on.
You're not going anywhere.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:32.492
I get you this hideout.
I get you a hangout, man, a hideout.

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:37.542
And look at this. You wanna split.
This is just terrific.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:42.039
Johnny, you don't know what
a few months in jail can do to you.

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:43.252
You get mean in jail.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.589
I just don't want to see it happen to you
like it happened to me.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:57.058
- What's going on?
- I wonder how that started?

01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:58.972
Jesus Christ!

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:10.734
Pony, where are you going?

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:12.823
Get over here, man!

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:17.116
- Gerry, some children are missing!
- No, they're not, Theresa.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.831
I'm sure of it.
Some have been gone for half an hour!

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.460
Get a hold of yourself!

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:27.546
Come back! Come back!
Don't go in there! You'll get hurt.

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.133
Come here, man! Get over here!

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:35.012
You're gonna get him?

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.303
Pony!

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:40.935
Go back before you get hurt.

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:49.739
Whoa!

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:00.534
What was that?

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:03.044
- Is that guy coming?
- No.

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:06.627
- How come? Too scared?
- No. He's too fat.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.138
Come on, man! In here!

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:26.018
Hey, Dal! Take this kid, man!
Take him!

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.433
Are you OK?

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:33.024
Pony, give them to Dallas!

01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:36.324
Get 'em and get out!

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.288
- Johnny!
- Come on, Johnny! Move!

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:45.666
Johnny! Come on!
Are you crazy?

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:50.084
- You're burning!
- Come on, Johnny!

01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:54.053
- No!
- Johnny!

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:01.971
Jesus Christ! Stupid kid!

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:07.855
I'm coming, Johnny!

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:22.198
- Johnny, Dallas...
- They're all right.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.915
They're behind us.
They're in another ambulance.

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:30.002
Anyway, you guys are the bravest kids
I've seen in a long time.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.296
What, are you guys
professional heroes or something?

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:35.302
We're Greasers.

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:38.848
- Are... are you kidding me?
- No, I ain't kidding you.

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:43.140
Take me to town.
You'll find out pretty fast.

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:53.195
You know, you shouldn't be smoking, son.

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:55.322
Why not?

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:59.736
Cos you're a young man, that's why.
It's a bad habit to get into.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:02.364
You're smoking.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:05.659
I'm older than you.
I've been smoking for a long time, too.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:17.470
Pull another stunt like that again,
I'm gonna kill you.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:29.307
Ponyboy!

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:34.688
Oh, look at your tough hair.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:37.489
Pony.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.571
Darry, I'm sorry!

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:44.159
I thought we lost you,
like we did Mum and Dad.

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:54.582
You sure look fine!

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:09.514
Let's go, little brother.
We're home.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:13.355
- Whoa!
- Getting pretty big to be carried.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:45.092
Hi, Tim.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:47.010
Hi, kid.

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:51.139
Can I get you some breakfast or something?

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:52.477
No.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.530
Thanks for letting me use your couch.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:02.238
Sure. Any time.

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:16.832
- Anybody home?
- Yeah, in here. Don't slam the door.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:24.298
Ponyboy, hey!

01:08:25.475 --> 01:08:28.434
- What you doing? Look what you did!
- Whoa!

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.845
You made me ruin my eggs,
drop my spoon.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:32.854
Look at the blond-headed monkey!

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:36.109
I wouldn't have believed it,
if I hadn't seen it in the paper.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.442
Tell me, Ponyboy,
what's it like being a hero, huh?

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:40.776
A what?

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.362
A hero, man.
You know, like a, like a big-shotie.

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:44.992
Beer for breakfast, Two-Bit?

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:48.537
What I like is the "turn hero" bit.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:51.073
They're charging Johnny with manslaughter?

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:54.081
What do they mean, "if he recovers"?

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:58.497
Them kids, they'd have burned to death,
if it hadn't been for you.

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:00.337
Dallas will be mad when he hears

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.671
they didn't mention his police record.

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:05.593
It's all about us.

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:09.220
Darry, me and Soda.

01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:14.096
Not a thing about putting me and Soda
in a boys' home?

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:15.606
No way!

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:18.109
No, they ain't putting me
in a boys' home!

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.611
Oh, hell, Ponyboy,
they don't do that to heroes.

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.898
Where is Soda and Super-Dope, anyhow?

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.951
- Whoa! Morning!
- Shut the door!

01:09:28.121 --> 01:09:29.487
The what?

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.497
All brawn and no brains.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.328
Darry, have you seen my DX shirt?

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.540
You gotta wear pants, too, buddy.
I think there's a law about that.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:39.626
- How about my jeans?
- I ironed 'em. They're in my closet.

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:42.133
- Darry...
- Hurry up! You're gonna be late.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:46.421
Darry, did you... did you hear
about that juvenile court thing?

01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:50.724
Yeah, the cops told me last night.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.807
Hey, after we stomp the Socs real good,

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:57.724
me and Steve are gonna throw a party
and everyone's gonna get ripped!

01:09:57.902 --> 01:10:01.019
- Where you gonna get the dough?
- I'll think of something.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:07.283
Hey, Two-Bit, Mickey's on TV.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.287
Pony? Pony?

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:23.083
You know, I hate to leave you
here by yourself.

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:24.922
Maybe I ought to take the day off.

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:27.838
I'll be OK.
I've stayed by myself plenty of times.

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:30.006
Besides, we can't afford it.

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:33.847
- Yeah, but I really ought to stay.
- Don't worry. I'll baby-sit him.

01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:37.479
Hey, why don't you get a job?
Ever think of getting a job, Two-Bit?

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:40.016
Hey, Soda, come on!
We gotta get to work!

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.108
I gotta quit smoking,
or I won't make track next year.

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:46.113
Hey, y'all, do up the dishes.

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:48.400
- I'm gonna cut off your hair.
- Lay off!

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.365
- Yeah, Two-Bit, lay off.
- He ain't looking so good.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.363
Lazy bum!

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.708
Pony...

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:04.458
You smoke more than a pack today,
and I'll skin you. You understand?

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.045
Yeah.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:09.553
If you carry more than one bundle of roofing
at a time today,

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:11.931
me and Soda here will skin you, understand?

01:11:14.562 --> 01:11:16.928
- Hey, say hi to Johnny.
- All right.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:21.607
- See you later, Pony.
- OK.

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:27.654
We gotta clean up the house.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:30.111
The cops and reporters
are gonna come by.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:33.949
And besides it's time for the people
from the state to check on us.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:37.490
Shoot, this house ain't messy.
You ought to see my house.

01:11:37.668 --> 01:11:39.750
I have, and if you had the sense
of a billy goat,

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:42.754
you'd clean your house up,
instead of bumming around ours.

01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:46.633
Shoot, kid! If I ever did that,
my mum would die of shock.

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:02.686
<i>You know what it takes,
you got it, baby...</i>

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.522
I would drive,
but the brakes went out on my car.

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:07.937
Almost killed me and Kathy the other night.

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:11.949
You ought to meet her brother.
Now, there's a hood.

01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:14.735
Boy, he's so greasy,
he glides when he walks.

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:19.282
He goes to the barber shop
for an oil change, not a haircut!

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:25.956
<i>About my troubles, troubles, troubles</i>

01:12:27.969 --> 01:12:30.881
<i>When it rains, it really pours...</i>

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:32.761
- Stay close.
- What do they want?

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:35.014
- I don't know.
- How many guys were in the car?

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:38.142
There were five.
Come on. Let's hurry up inside.

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:41.729
Let's see what they want.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:44.891
Why do you want to see
what they want?

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:46.354
Just stay here.

01:12:55.746 --> 01:12:58.362
No jabs before the rumble.
You know the rules, ape face.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:01.203
We know. I wanna talk to you.

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:06.542
- Go ahead. I'll keep my eye on him.
- Come on.

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:10.841
Speaking of the rumble, pal...

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:17.341
I read about you in the paper.
How come?

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:21.969
I don't know.
I felt like playing the superhero.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:25.185
- I wouldn't have.
- You wouldn't have what?

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:27.645
I would have let those kids
burn to death.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.062
You might not have.
You might have done the same thing.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.525
I don't know.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.659
I just don't know
anything any more, I guess.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:40.071
I never would have believed a Greaser
could pull something like that.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.911
A Greaser didn't have
nothing to do with it.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.701
Check out their pants!

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:48.629
Do you wanna talk inside?

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:51.048
Are you boys waiting for a flood?

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:57.722
I hear they stamp your face
into gorilla cookies.

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.346
- You're funny!
- Oh, yeah?

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:04.186
I couldn't tell this to anyone else.

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.689
My friends, they'd think
I was off my rocker.

01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:12.903
That friend of yours,
the one that got burned, he might die.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:15.614
Yeah.

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:20.532
And tonight, people will get hurt
at the rumble. Maybe killed, right?

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:27.618
You can't win.
You know that, don't you?

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:29.920
It doesn't matter if you whip us,

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:32.582
you'll still be where you were before -
at the bottom.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.173
We'll still be the lucky ones
at the top with all the breaks.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:38.963
It doesn't matter.

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:42.474
The Greasers will still be Greasers,
and the Socs will still be Socs.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:44.101
It doesn't matter.

01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:49.478
Anyway, thanks, Greaser.

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:54.604
Hey, I didn't mean that.
I meant, thanks, kid.

01:14:57.034 --> 01:15:00.618
It's been nice talking to you, Randy.
My name's Ponyboy.

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:12.955
You're real funny, Two-Bit!
Come on, Let's go.

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:17.050
- Now get the hell out of here.
- See you at the rumble.

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:20.088
We're gonna kick some ass tonight.

01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:24.050
So what did Mr. Super Soc have to say?

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:26.560
He ain't a Soc.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.722
Just a guy that wanted to talk, that's all.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:35.444
- Take care.
- See you later. Take it easy.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:36.724
Take it easy!

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:42.360
Well, I wanna see this doctor!

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:46.656
Nurse, Nurse, it's all right.
You can go in, boys.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:50.122
He's been asking for you.
It can't hurt.

01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:53.788
The doctor said you can go in.
There's the room.

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:03.968
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey, y'all.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.137
How are they treating you, kid?

01:16:14.862 --> 01:16:19.731
Loo, got your picture in the paper here
for... being a hero.

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.319
Look at that.

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:24.736
Yeah, that's tough enough, huh?

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.410
Guess you can look at it later.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.040
Do you want anything?

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:36.046
A book, man.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:39.175
Can y'all get me another one?

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.677
I think he wants a copy
of "Gone With The Wind",

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:44.213
so I can read it to him.

01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:46.973
Would you mind going downstairs
and getting one?

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:51.346
They got a gift shop downstairs.
I'll go get it.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.075
So...

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.331
I guess Dal's gonna be OK.

01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:16.420
Me and Darry,
we're getting along real good now.

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:20.624
Johnny, are you OK?

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:24.261
Oh, yeah. It just hurts sometimes.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:29.675
Usually, it don't,
cos I can't feel anything

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:31.560
below the middle of my back.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.517
Pretty bad off, ain't I, Ponyboy?

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:36.853
No. You're gonna be all right, kid.

01:17:38.696 --> 01:17:40.277
You gotta be.

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.196
Couldn't get along without you.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:46.575
- I won't be able to walk again.
- Huh?

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:49.782
Not even on crutches.
Doc says I busted my back.

01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:52.164
You're gonna be fine.

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:56.418
I know you are.

01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:59.588
You wanna know something, Ponyboy?

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:01.999
I used to talk about killing myself
all the time.

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:04.419
Man, I don't wanna die now.

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:08.761
It ain't long enough.
16 years ain't gonna be long enough.

01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:12.100
Hell, I wouldn't have minded so much,

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:14.637
if there wasn't so much stuff
I ain't done yet.

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:17.807
So many, so many damn things
I ain't seen or nothing.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.312
That time we were up in Windrixville...

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:28.029
Was the only time I've ever been away
from our neighbourhood.

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:32.746
Knock it off.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:36.909
If you get too juiced up,
the doc won't let us see you no more.

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:45.134
Johnny, your mother's here
to see you.

01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:47.386
I don't wanna see her.

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:49.638
It's your mother.
She's here to see you.

01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:51.389
I said I don't wanna see her.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.973
She probably just wants to tell me
how much trouble I'm causing.

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:56.978
Why don't you tell her
to leave me al...

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:02.484
- What's the matter?
- You can't see him now.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:05.317
- Pony, is he OK?
- I don't know.

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:06.697
He's all right.

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:10.109
- Make sure he gets this, all right?
- OK.

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.906
I've got a right to see him!
He's my son!

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:21.212
He'd rather see these no-good punks
than his own mother! You scum!

01:19:21.382 --> 01:19:22.792
No wonder he hates your guts!

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:26.551
You don't even care about him,
you damn drunk!

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.211
You go straight to hell!
You go right to hell!

01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:32.006
- You just...
- Come on!

01:19:36.814 --> 01:19:39.430
- What's happened to your gown?
- I threw it away.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:43.021
Get out! Just get out!
You make my stomach sick!

01:19:45.572 --> 01:19:48.109
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing, man?

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:50.650
Swiped you a gift, man.

01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:54.412
It's good to see you guys, man.
This place gives me the creeps.

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:55.741
I want out.

01:19:57.501 --> 01:19:59.583
Tim Shepard dropped by.

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:03.537
Saw my picture in the paper
and couldn't believe

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:07.459
it didn't have "wanted dead or alive"
written underneath it.

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:10.218
He started rubbing it in
about the rumble, man.

01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:12.676
I hate missing it.

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:16.592
You got a cigarette, Pone?

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:19.394
Thanks.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:29.230
How is he?
How's Johnny doing, man?

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:32.449
Look, Dal,
I don't know about stuff like this,

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:36.783
but... but he didn't look too good.

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.749
He passed out cold before we left.

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:53.970
You still got that knife on you?

01:20:54.141 --> 01:20:56.598
- What?
- The knife.

01:20:58.228 --> 01:20:59.764
Give me it, will you?

01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:07.601
Thank you.

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.693
You know, we gotta win that fight tonight.

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:17.532
We gotta get EVEN with those Socs!

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:26.082
Let's do it for Johnny, man.
We'll do it for Johnny!

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:36.797
Are you OK, Pony?

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:41.848
Well, you feel kinda hot.

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:44.896
I'm OK.

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:47.524
Be a pal and don't tell Darry,
OK, Two-Bit?

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:51.687
I'll take a bunch of aspirins
when I get home.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.197
All right.

01:21:54.368 --> 01:21:57.986
Darry will kill me if he finds out
you're sick, and you fight anyway.

01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:01.697
Keep your trap shut,
he won't find nothing out.

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:07.916
You know the only thing that keeps Darry
from being a Soc is us?

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:10.497
Yeah, I know.

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:12.833
Come on, man.

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:18.384
Tonight...
I don't like it one bit.

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:22.718
Something awful is gonna happen.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.951
We're gonna stomp ass
on those Socs tonight.

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:43.114
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Yeah.

01:22:49.423 --> 01:22:53.257
- Tough little kids, huh?
- Yeah. Future Greasers.

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:55.167
Yeah!

01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:56.881
Ponyboy!

01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:59.426
Hey, Two-Bit!

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.261
What's up with the big times?

01:23:08.032 --> 01:23:09.063
No weapons.

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:12.062
They play your way.
It's a fair deal.

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:14.353
Are you sure about that?

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:16.613
Well, Randy told me.
He knows for sure.

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.363
Good deal. Thanks, Cherry.

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:24.537
Ponyboy, wait a minute.

01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:26.414
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:31.704
How's Johnny doing?

01:23:31.882 --> 01:23:35.374
Not so good.
Would you come up and see him?

01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:38.760
- No, I couldn't.
- Why not?

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:40.971
I couldn't.

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:45.805
He killed Bob!

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.684
Maybe Bob asked for it.

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:52.099
I know he did.

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:57.571
But you didn't know his other side.
He could be real sweet.

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:01.608
He wasn't just any boy.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:05.199
Bob had something
that made him different.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:09.992
Made people follow him.
Maybe better than the crowd. You know what I mean?

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:12.707
That's OK.
I don't want you to go see him.

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:14.712
We don't need your damn charity!

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:18.125
Ponyboy!

01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:21.712
I wasn't trying to give you charity!

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.684
I only wanted to help.

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:31.434
I liked you from the start.

01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:33.314
The way we talked.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:37.652
Wouldn't you try to help me
if you thought you could?

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:43.321
Can you see the sunset
from the southside very good?

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:45.611
Yeah, real good.

01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:49.159
You can see it
from the northside, too.

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:54.420
Thanks, Ponyboy. You dig OK.

01:24:55.632 --> 01:24:57.293
See you around.

01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:15.441
- Soda, when did you start shaving?
- When I was 15.

01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:21.025
- When did, when did Darry?
- When he was 13.

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:24.532
Why? Figuring on growing a beard
for the rumble?

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:26.239
Oh, you're funny!

01:25:26.413 --> 01:25:28.779
Maybe I'll send you
into the Reader's Digest.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:31.039
They pay a lot of money
for funny things.

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:33.370
- Let's go, then.
- Forget it.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:36.412
- Come on. Come on, Soda.
- You like fights, huh, Soda?

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:39.582
- Yeah, I like fights, man.
- You like fights, huh?

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.671
- How come?
- It's a contest.

01:25:41.845 --> 01:25:43.836
It's like a drag race,
or a dance or something.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:46.881
We're gonna beat them Socs'
heads in, ain't we?

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:49.721
When I get into a fight, I wanna stomp!
I like it, too.

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:55.180
Why do you like fights, Darry?

01:25:55.359 --> 01:25:57.566
He likes to show off his muscles!

01:25:57.736 --> 01:26:00.978
Hey, I'm gonna show 'em off on you,
if you get any mouthier!

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:05.865
Hey, Pony...

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:09.611
I don't know if you ought to be
in this rumble.

01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:12.748
How come?
I've always come through before, ain't I?

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:17.169
Yeah, but, you know,
you was in shape before, and...

01:26:18.382 --> 01:26:21.715
You know, you ain't looking so good.
You're tensed up all the time.

01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:25.719
Let him fight, man.
Everyone's tensed up before a rumble.

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:28.801
It's skin against skin.
He ain't gonna get hurt, is he?

01:26:30.477 --> 01:26:33.014
Come on.
I'll grab hold of little one.

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:36.396
We will need every man we can get,
but... I don't know.

01:26:36.566 --> 01:26:39.433
If it was with knives or chains,
it'd be different.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:42.151
I'll be OK.

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:46.737
- All right, but you be careful, OK?
- I will be.

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:49.151
How come you never worry
about him so much?

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:52.617
Man, that's one kid brother
I ain't gotta worry about.

01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:56.375
This kid can use his head.
At least for one thing, to grow hair on!

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:57.955
Get out!

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:13.426
All right! Yeah!
Go, go, go!

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:17.429
Come on, come on, come on!
What do you think?

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.067
Come on! Come on!

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:25.900
You and Ponyboy, if the fuzz show,
beat it out of there.

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.816
We'll get jailed,
but you two will get the boys' home.

01:27:28.994 --> 01:27:30.404
Know what I'm saying?

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:33.616
Ain't nobody gonna call the fuzz
in this neighbourhood!

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:35.246
Hey!

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:38.454
All the same, you two beat it
out of there. Do you hear me?

01:27:38.628 --> 01:27:39.993
Yeah, bro.

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:57.097
How are you doing, Tim?

01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:59.437
Pretty good.

01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:05.231
You and the quiet kid were the ones
who killed the Soc, right?

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:08.738
- Yeah.
- Good going, kid.

01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:11.116
Curly always said
you were a good kid.

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:15.363
Curly's in the reformatory
for the next six months.

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:37.027
The odds are as even as we can get.
You stay close to me, kid.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:30:00.384
Hello, Darrel.
Long time no see.

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:02.222
Hello, Paul.

01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:03.762
What's up?

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.477
They used to buddy around together,
play football.

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:08.270
I'll take you.

01:30:08.445 --> 01:30:11.152
You know, a rumble ain't a rumble
without me!

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:24.426
Ponyboy!

01:31:43.623 --> 01:31:44.908
Ponyboy!

01:31:57.846 --> 01:32:00.007
What are you guys doing?

01:32:00.807 --> 01:32:02.923
Let's get out of here!

01:32:11.151 --> 01:32:13.267
Ponyboy, are you OK?

01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:34.041
Are you OK? Come on.

01:32:37.751 --> 01:32:38.667
Yeah!

01:33:02.744 --> 01:33:06.987
W-w-wait. Act sick. I'll pretend
like I'm taking you to the hospital.

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:11.332
You've got to have a good reason
for driving like that.

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:14.870
Uh, the kid fell off his motorcycle.
I'm taking him to the hospital.

01:33:22.514 --> 01:33:25.096
- How bad is he?
- I don't know, man.

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:27.973
Do I look like a doctor?
He looks pretty bad to me.

01:33:28.144 --> 01:33:29.805
- Follow me.
- All right.

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:34.059
Sucker!

01:33:51.376 --> 01:33:52.912
Man.

01:33:59.759 --> 01:34:01.499
I was crazy. You know that, kid?

01:34:01.678 --> 01:34:04.966
I was crazy about wanting Johnny
to stay out of trouble, man.

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:08.132
If he was smart like me,
he wouldn't have been in this mess.

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:11.472
If he was smart like me,
he wouldn't have ran in that church!

01:34:13.356 --> 01:34:17.725
You better wise up, Pony, man.
You just better wise up, man.

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:20.314
You get tough like me,
and you don't get hurt!

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:26.449
Watch out for yourself,
and nothing can touch you, man!

01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:42.795
Hey.

01:34:42.969 --> 01:34:44.550
Hey, Johnny.

01:34:45.305 --> 01:34:46.715
We beat the Socs, man.

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:49.597
We chased them right out
of our neighbourhood.

01:34:49.767 --> 01:34:52.679
- Go on.
- It's useless.

01:34:53.563 --> 01:34:56.930
- Huh?
- Fighting ain't no good.

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:03.941
You know, they're still writing editorials
about you in the papers,

01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:05.571
about you being a hero.

01:35:06.993 --> 01:35:10.110
We're all proud of you, buddy.
It's gonna be all right.

01:35:10.663 --> 01:35:12.528
Ponyboy...

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:15.915
Ponyboy...

01:35:20.298 --> 01:35:22.004
S-s-s...

01:35:22.175 --> 01:35:25.383
Stay gold, Ponyboy.

01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:28.544
Stay gold.

01:35:39.776 --> 01:35:41.687
Johnny, come on.

01:35:46.366 --> 01:35:48.106
S-so, this is what you get, huh?

01:35:48.284 --> 01:35:50.491
This is what you get
for helping people?

01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:54.411
You punk!

01:35:55.291 --> 01:35:57.407
Come on, Johnny! Don't die!

01:35:59.128 --> 01:36:00.584
Come on.

01:36:01.839 --> 01:36:04.581
Come on, Johnny.
Don't die on me now.

01:36:06.052 --> 01:36:07.588
Please.

01:36:14.227 --> 01:36:15.717
Bastards!

01:36:47.135 --> 01:36:49.091
Hey, you, you're not allowed here.

01:36:52.557 --> 01:36:54.673
I'm allowed anywhere I want.

01:36:58.021 --> 01:36:59.431
You're out of your mind.

01:36:59.605 --> 01:37:03.644
Why do you bother helping people?
It doesn't do any good!

01:37:06.946 --> 01:37:11.155
Well, it makes me look
kinda... kinda tough.

01:37:11.326 --> 01:37:14.443
What do you think, Soda?
Do you think it makes me look tough?

01:37:16.247 --> 01:37:18.954
I think it makes you look different.

01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:21.241
That guy had sharp teeth.

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:24.035
What do you mean by "different"?

01:37:24.213 --> 01:37:26.169
You got a hole in your mouth.

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.714
Hey, where you been?

01:37:38.644 --> 01:37:42.182
Hey, Pony, what..?
What's wrong?

01:37:44.984 --> 01:37:46.599
Johnny's dead.

01:37:53.576 --> 01:37:55.487
I told him about beating the Socs.

01:37:56.496 --> 01:38:00.239
I don't know... He just died.
Told me to "stay gold."

01:38:02.085 --> 01:38:03.541
Hey, Pony.

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.497
Dally's gone.

01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:09.164
He couldn't take it.
He's gonna blow.

01:38:34.325 --> 01:38:36.281
Do you wanna buy one of those, son?

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:46.117
You tear those up, you have
to pay for 'em. Don't do that.

01:38:54.011 --> 01:38:56.127
You know, you gotta pay
for that magazine.

01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:02.633
Oh, God. Don't shoot.

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:06.558
Give me the money.
Give me the money!

01:39:06.732 --> 01:39:08.347
I'm so sick of you punks.

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:10.357
Take it and get out of here!

01:39:38.139 --> 01:39:40.346
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Hello, Darrel?

01:39:40.516 --> 01:39:41.926
<i>No, it's Steve. Dally?</i>

01:39:42.101 --> 01:39:45.013
- Steve, I want to talk to Darry.
- <i>Yeah, sure.</i>

01:39:46.564 --> 01:39:49.351
- Hello?
- <i>All right, Darry, listen.</i>

01:39:49.525 --> 01:39:50.605
Yeah?

01:39:50.776 --> 01:39:54.143
<i>I robbed a store.
The cops are looking for me.</i>

01:39:54.322 --> 01:39:57.155
- Can you meet me in the park?
- <i>Sure, Dal. Are you all right?</i>

01:39:57.325 --> 01:39:59.190
- Yeah. Johnny's dead.
- <i>We know.</i>

01:39:59.368 --> 01:40:00.824
<i>Johnny...</i>

01:40:00.995 --> 01:40:04.237
- Meet me in the park, will you?
- <i>Hang on. We'll be right there.</i>

01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:09.701
That was Dally. The cops are after him.
We gotta hide him.

01:40:27.522 --> 01:40:29.934
- You're never gonna get me alive!
- Drop it!

01:40:31.150 --> 01:40:34.313
- It's not loaded! Don't!
- Stop!

01:40:34.487 --> 01:40:35.897
It's not loaded!

01:40:38.074 --> 01:40:39.439
No! No!

01:40:39.617 --> 01:40:41.528
He's just a kid!

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:50.165
- No!
- Pony?

01:40:54.966 --> 01:40:57.799
You stupid idiot!

01:40:57.969 --> 01:41:00.005
You stupid freak!

01:41:00.179 --> 01:41:03.012
Johnny and Dallas both...

01:41:08.104 --> 01:41:11.221
- Soda?
- Yeah?

01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:15.142
- Is somebody sick?
- Yeah, somebody's sick.

01:41:17.363 --> 01:41:18.694
Quiet.

01:41:19.448 --> 01:41:22.315
<i>He tried to drown me.</i>

01:41:23.869 --> 01:41:25.530
<i>I could have made it simpler</i>

01:41:25.705 --> 01:41:28.162
<i>for the fight not to have happened
in the first place.</i>

01:41:28.332 --> 01:41:32.120
Sure. Your name is Sherry?
But your nickname is Cherry?

01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:33.535
Yes.

01:41:33.713 --> 01:41:35.749
<i>You know, to teach 'em a lesson.</i>

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:40.587
Yes, there was an argument
because my boyfriend showed up,

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:45.004
and... well, he was upset
that we were with the other boys.

01:41:45.182 --> 01:41:47.047
They chased us and caught us.

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:49.721
It was Bob and I.

01:41:49.895 --> 01:41:52.637
They threw me in the fountain
and tried to drown me.

01:41:52.815 --> 01:41:55.648
- Just to go looking for 'em.
- Gonna beat up Johnny Cade.

01:41:55.818 --> 01:41:57.399
You know, teach 'em a lesson.

01:41:57.570 --> 01:41:58.776
I could have made it simpler

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:01.608
for the fight not to have happened
in the first place.

01:42:04.535 --> 01:42:06.150
<i>I could have made it simpler</i>

01:42:06.329 --> 01:42:08.911
<i>for the fight not to have happened
in the first place.</i>

01:42:18.341 --> 01:42:20.252
Defendant not guilty.

01:42:20.426 --> 01:42:24.760
At this time, I will place him in the custody
of his older brother, Darrel.

01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:26.511
This court is adjourned.

01:43:19.652 --> 01:43:21.313
Hey, Ponyboy?

01:43:22.571 --> 01:43:24.061
Oh, hi, Mr. Simms.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:26.322
I gotta talk to you about your grade.

01:43:26.492 --> 01:43:28.357
Yeah, I know I'm doing lousy.

01:43:28.536 --> 01:43:30.151
Frankly, you're flunking.

01:43:30.329 --> 01:43:34.072
But, I'll tell you what,
taking into consideration the circumstances,

01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:36.582
you come up with a good semester theme,

01:43:36.752 --> 01:43:38.242
I'll pass you with a C.

01:43:39.547 --> 01:43:41.708
Should it be some kind
of research paper?

01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:44.211
Personal experience will do it.

01:43:46.887 --> 01:43:50.300
Great! My first trip to the zoo!

01:43:59.817 --> 01:44:03.105
With your brains and grades, man,
you could get a scholarship.

01:44:03.279 --> 01:44:06.237
And we could put you through college.
Isn't that right, Soda?

01:44:08.033 --> 01:44:11.275
You live in a vacuum, Pony,
and you're gonna have to cut it out.

01:44:11.454 --> 01:44:13.786
There's no stop living,
cos you lose somebody.

01:44:13.956 --> 01:44:15.446
I thought you knew that.

01:44:17.543 --> 01:44:21.661
You don't like the way I'm running things,
you can get out, all right?

01:44:21.839 --> 01:44:25.331
You'd like me to just get out!
But it's not that easy, is it, Soda?

01:44:25.509 --> 01:44:27.750
Goddamn, you guys!
Leave me out of it!

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:29.418
What's wrong with you?

01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:44.108
Run on!
I'll be right behind you.

01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:45.688
OK!

01:44:53.037 --> 01:44:54.447
Goddamn it, Ponyboy.

01:44:54.622 --> 01:44:57.955
You should have gone out for football
instead of track.

01:44:58.125 --> 01:45:00.832
- Where you think you're going?
- I don't know, man!

01:45:05.049 --> 01:45:07.165
Just, like, sometimes
I have to get out.

01:45:09.386 --> 01:45:13.595
It's like I'm a middleman
in a tug-of-war between you guys.

01:45:16.602 --> 01:45:18.718
I don't know. I can't take sides.

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:27.643
Ponyboy...

01:45:28.823 --> 01:45:31.155
Darry could have put you
in a boys' home.

01:45:31.325 --> 01:45:33.407
Worked his way through college.

01:45:36.163 --> 01:45:37.699
I'm telling you true, Pony.

01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:42.662
You don't wanna be like me, anyway.

01:45:42.837 --> 01:45:45.544
Cos I'm happy working in a gas station.

01:45:47.925 --> 01:45:50.462
You'd never be happy
doing something like that.

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:54.469
Darry...

01:45:55.432 --> 01:45:59.266
You guys stop yelling at him
for every little thing that he does, man.

01:46:00.396 --> 01:46:03.308
He feels things different than you.

01:46:04.525 --> 01:46:07.642
It's bad enough having to listen to you.

01:46:11.615 --> 01:46:14.482
But when you start
trying to get me to take sides...

01:46:15.494 --> 01:46:17.860
We're all we got left now.

01:46:20.833 --> 01:46:26.078
If we don't have each other...
you end up like Dallas.

01:46:27.256 --> 01:46:30.248
And I don't mean dead either.
I mean, how he was before.

01:46:33.762 --> 01:46:35.878
So, please.

01:46:36.557 --> 01:46:38.388
Don't fight any more.

01:46:38.559 --> 01:46:40.015
Please.

01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:45.395
Sure. Sure, little buddy.
We ain't gonna fight no more.

01:46:52.781 --> 01:46:54.442
Ponyboy...

01:46:55.159 --> 01:46:56.444
Pone.

01:47:00.915 --> 01:47:03.372
Now, don't you start bawling, too, Pony.

01:47:03.542 --> 01:47:05.749
One bawling baby in this family is enough.

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:07.376
I ain't crying.

01:47:09.715 --> 01:47:12.172
Let's go home. I'm cold.

01:48:05.771 --> 01:48:08.808
Ponyboy, I asked the nurse
to give you this book,

01:48:08.983 --> 01:48:11.269
so you could finish it.

01:48:11.443 --> 01:48:15.061
It was worth saving those kids.
Their lives are worth more than mine.

01:48:15.239 --> 01:48:17.651
They have more to live for.

01:48:17.825 --> 01:48:19.816
Tell Dally I think it's worth it.

01:48:21.662 --> 01:48:23.072
I'm gonna miss you guys.

01:48:23.247 --> 01:48:27.786
I've been thinking about it,
and that poem, that guy that wrote it.

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.171
He meant you're gold
when you're a kid. Like green.

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:35.376
When you're a kid everything's new.

01:48:36.343 --> 01:48:37.799
Dawn.

01:48:38.512 --> 01:48:41.629
Like the way you dig sunsets, Pony.
That's gold.

01:48:42.516 --> 01:48:45.178
Keep it that way.
It's a good way to be.

01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:48.635
I want you to ask Dally
to look at one.

01:48:48.814 --> 01:48:51.021
I don't think he's ever seen a sunset.

01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:55.066
There's still lots of good in the world.

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:58.570
Tell Dally. I don't think he knows.

01:49:00.159 --> 01:49:02.195
Your buddy, Johnny.

01:49:32.232 --> 01:49:37.647
<i>When I stepped out
into the bright sunlight</i>

01:49:37.821 --> 01:49:40.904
<i>from the darkness of the movie house,</i>

01:49:41.075 --> 01:49:43.441
<i>I had only two things on my mind.</i>

01:49:44.536 --> 01:49:46.993
<i>Paul Newman and a ride home.</i>

01:49:55.172 --> 01:50:03.420
<i>Seize upon that moment long ago</i>

01:50:06.183 --> 01:50:10.768
<i>One breath away
and there you will be</i>

01:50:10.938 --> 01:50:14.522
<i>So young and carefree</i>

01:50:14.691 --> 01:50:17.979
<i>Again you will see</i>

01:50:18.153 --> 01:50:21.395
<i>That place in time</i>

01:50:21.573 --> 01:50:24.861
<i>So gold</i>

01:50:25.953 --> 01:50:34.622
<i>Still away into that way back when</i>

01:50:36.755 --> 01:50:41.749
<i>You thought that all
would last for ever</i>

01:50:41.927 --> 01:50:45.215
<i>But like the weather</i>

01:50:45.389 --> 01:50:52.261
<i>Nothing can ever and be in time</i>

01:50:52.437 --> 01:50:55.725
<i>Stay gold</i>

01:50:57.609 --> 01:51:04.026
<i>But can it be when we can see</i>

01:51:04.199 --> 01:51:11.196
<i>So vividly a memory</i>

01:51:11.373 --> 01:51:13.705
<i>And "yes" you say</i>

01:51:13.876 --> 01:51:20.338
<i>So must the day too fade away</i>

01:51:20.507 --> 01:51:26.218
<i>And leave a ray of sun</i>

01:51:26.388 --> 01:51:30.882
<i>So gold</i>

01:51:33.061 --> 01:51:41.730
<i>Life is but a twinkling of an eye</i>

01:51:44.198 --> 01:51:49.363
<i>Yet filled with sorrow and compassion</i>

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:52.243
<i>Though not imagined</i>

01:51:52.414 --> 01:51:56.373
<i>All things that happen</i>

01:51:56.543 --> 01:52:00.127
<i>Will age too old</i>

01:52:00.297 --> 01:52:04.540
<i>Though gold</i>

01:52:04.718 --> 01:52:11.055
<i>Gold, gold, though gold</i>

01:52:12.305 --> 01:52:18.547
