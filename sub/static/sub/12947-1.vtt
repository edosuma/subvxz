WEBVTT

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
I love you, Mommy.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
MAN: This is our target --
the nuclear power plant.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
If we capture the plane
at precisely the right moment,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
they will not have time
to shoot down the aircraft.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
MAN:
If they hit that power plant

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
with that aircraft,

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
the casualties could be
in the hundreds of thousands.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
God help us all.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
ANNOUNCER:  ...except...

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
What? What is this CPT?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
WOMAN:
That means the plane is gonna

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
get here when it gets here.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
ANNOUNCER: They picked the wrong airline.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
And don't come up here
complaining and shit.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
You motherfuckers wanna
come on here

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
and act a goddamn fool?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm about to go on break.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
You motherfucking terrorists
kill me.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
ANNOUNCER:  Come see why black incompetence...

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Hey, hey, shorty!

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Whoo, whoo!

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Goddamn, that bitch
phat as a motherfucker.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
...is our funniest weapon in the war on terror.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
We can't let you through,
homey.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Hey, this is Osama bin Laden
nephew, nigga.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, I-- I'm --
I'm once removed. I-I--

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
No --
I just fucking with you, dawg.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Go ahead, nigga.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
ANNOUNCER: Starring Gary Anthony Williams.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
But you know what they say --
when it's your time to go,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
it's your time to go. John Witherspoon.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
What if it's the motherfucker
next to me time to go? Huh?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Mo'Nique.
It's very important

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
this plane leave on time.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Damn. Now, are you yelling
at me or shitting at me?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Snoop Dogg.
Hijacked?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Them niggas ain't getting
my wizzie fo' shizzle, nigga.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
You know what I'm saying? And 50 Cent

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
as Air Marshal 50 Cent.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'll stop
those terrorists...

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
or die trying.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Get ready. This time, it's going down.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
This is a hijacking.
Remain in your seats --

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
No, this nigga
didn't.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
We have a bomb on the aircraft.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Everyone remain --

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm about to go
get dressed.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
We gonna fly on the
Soul Plane!

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
GRANDDAD:
Riley, hurry up.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
We gonna fly on
the  Soul Plane!

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
And make sure you pee
before we leave.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
I ain't gonna miss my movie

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
going to the bathroom
with you.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm gonna let you go in there
by yourself

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
and get molested
by a nasty white man.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
What's wrong with you?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I don't wanna go to the movie.
Why not?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't ever wanna go
to the movies with you again.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Not after
what happened last time.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
What happened last time?

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
We got arrested. And  shot at.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Ah. Racism.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Daddy said I can go
to the movies,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
but he said I'm not allowed
to see  Soul Plane.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Good. You don't wanna go
to the movies with him.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
He's crazy.
Hush.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Can't see  Soul Plane?
Why, little baby?

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Because of the types
of stereos or something.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Types of stereos?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh. No, no, no,
little baby doll.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
This is a good theater.
They have THX.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
She means stereotypes.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Stereotypes? In  Soul Plane?
That's nonsense.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Say, how about we tell
your daddy

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
we saw something else, hm?

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
You mean...lie?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
That really doesn't seem to be
a good idea.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Hush, boy.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
You know,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
it's okay to break
the rules

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
every once
in a while.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I won't tell
if you won't.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Okay. Hee-hee.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
HUEY:  Sometimes I think Granddad may be a bad influence.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Hey, Riley. Don't forget
the camcorder.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, the first  Soul Plane
was funny.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Pfft. About as funny
as a lynching.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Oh, hush, boy.
You ain't even see it.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I never seen
a lynching, either,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
but I know
they not funny.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
See? Shows what you know.
I've seen funny lynchings.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
No, you haven't.
I have so.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Roscoe Patterson's lynching
was funny.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, so them
niggas was like,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
"Roscoe, you better
leaves town

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
"before Mr. Charlie
and them crackers

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
gonna come for you."

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm like, "Man,
fuck them crackers, man.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
This is Roscoe Patterson."
Nigga, I don't give a fuck.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I just don't
give a fuck.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Know what I'm saying?
White man can eat a dick.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Eat my balls,
nigga.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
MAN: There he is!
Get that nigger.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Uh-oh.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Come on,
let's go!

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
MAN: Oh, shoot, he's fast!
Watch out!

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It, uh, wasn't really
funny after that.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Mm-mm.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
This is gonna be so much fun.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
This  is going to be...

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
...the worst day
of your life.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm bringing nunchucks.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Huh?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Here, put these coats on.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Huh?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
GRANDDAD:
Here you go.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
What is it?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
It's pinto beans
and neck bones.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Now put this meat loaf
and gravy under your shirt.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Why don't we just get treats
from the concession stand?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
You think I'm paying $20
for some popcorn?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
You must be out
of your damn mind.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Are we allowed
to bring in food?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Of course we're allowed to.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
It's my food, isn't it?
I paid for it.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
That means I can eat it
when and where I want.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Boy, put this pot roast in
your pants or you ain't eating.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, this is nothing.
He's just getting started.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
HUEY: Robert Jebediah Freeman

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
had sworn a lifetime intifada

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
against the movie theater industry

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
for exorbitant prices and poor customer service,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
which, interestingly enough,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
did not stop him from going to see movies.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Okay, gang.
Keep your eyes open.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Open for what?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We're sneaking in.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
That's not true,
little baby.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I bought my tickets online.
Scout's honor.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Look. Granddad.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I got some money saved.
The movie will be on me.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Now, you put that away,
boy.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
These movie devils
ain't getting

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
any more of our money.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Mm-mm.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Uh...Mr. Freeman?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It says, "No outside food,"
little girl.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That's why we keep it
inside our clothes.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Are you sure
this is legal?

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Okay, everybody, look alive now.
Here's our chance.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I understand
you need your job,

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
but you're still
a human being with dignity.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah, I mean,
look at this uniform, man.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I look like
a fucking dork.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Why would they make me dress
like this?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
What did I do
to them, huh?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
You should take action.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Ah. What can  I  do?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Have you ever thought about
forming a union?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
What's a "union"?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I paid.
I got my ticket.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah, yeah. I got
a ticket for you.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
A one-way ticket
to "Get the hell

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
out of here, negro"
land.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Go on! Move it!

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Nigga, you gay.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
How about that?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Another victory
of the common man

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
over corporate greed.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You're not advancing
any struggle

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
by being cheap,
Granddad.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I'll advance my belt
on your behind

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
if you don't shut
your ass.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Oh, my God.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I didn't pay
to get in the movie.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Uh, yes, we did. I --
I ordered my tickets online.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Who got the neck bones?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
No, you didn't.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
We snuck in.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
We stole a movie.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Now, who makes the rules?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Grownups, right?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And I'm grown up,
and I say it's okay.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
We're gonna
get caught.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
We're gonna
get caught.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I should call my daddy
and turn myself in.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, yeah?
You gonna tell him

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
what you came to see,  huh?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I bet he'd like
to know that.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Maybe  I  should make
a phone call.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
No. Please, no.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Good. Now just
calm down.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Try some mashed potatoes.
Who got the popcorn?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I do, Granddad.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Ow! Hey.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
What the hell is wrong
with you?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
What am I gonna do
with raw popcorn?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
You're gonna ruin my dentures.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Whew. Damn, can't watch
a movie without popcorn.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Now I gotta spend
all my damn money

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
on a bucket
of popcorn.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Told you.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh. Help me.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I'll give you anything. Ah!

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
ANNOUNCER: Don't steal movies.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
GRANDDAD: Damn.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Large freshly popped popcorn,
please. And lots of butter.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Anything else?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I asked
for butter on it.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Butter's over there.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I don't wanna put the butter
on it. Why can't you do it?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
You're supposed to
put the butter on it.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I don't wanna
put the butter on it.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm already paying $20
for this bullshit popcorn.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I will not demean myself

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
by putting butter
on popcorn.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Why? It's really easy.
Why?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Because I don't work at
the movie theater, that's why.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
You're supposed to put
the butter on it.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
If I go to Burger King
and order a cheeseburger,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
they don't make me put
the cheese on it, do

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
they, Goddamn it!

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
I see, I see. Just 'cause
your skin is light, bright,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
and two shades
from being white,

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
you think you too good
to butter your own popcorn.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, you wrong,
Lando Calrissian.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Damn it, Ruckus. Y'all gonna
put some butter on this popcorn.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
We put our lives on the line
every day to make movies,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
and then people come along
and steal all that hard work.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Who would do something
like that?

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
A terrible, awful human being
that no one will ever love.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
That's who.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I'm so sorry, Mr. Stuntman.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Hey. Get to the flick.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
What happened
to the movies?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Y'all should be
ashamed.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Why is it
when I order a soda pop,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I get a empty cup?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I didn't order
a empty cup.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I ordered a soda pop.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And what asshole started putting
commercials in movies?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I can see commercials
at home on TV.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And the bathroom stink.
Clean the fucking bathroom!

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm not gonna
take it anymore!

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
I pay too much damn money
for these movie tickets

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
to butter my own
motherfucking popcorn!

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
It's only popcorn.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
When did you
get here?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Huh?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Well, I been at
the ticket window all day long,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
and I don't remember you
buying no ticket,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Robert Freeman.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Uh, I-I-I got my tickets
online.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Aha! A damn lie.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I ain't never
met a nigga

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
smart enough to use
a personal computer.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Not even a Macintosh.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Uh...

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
You'll never take me alive,
you punk-asses.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
RUCKUS:
Stop him!

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Come on, come on.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
He went this-a way.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Mm-hmm.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Whew.
Did I miss anything?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Mr. Freeman...

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I don't wanna steal the movie.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I wanna go home!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Shh!

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
What's wrong with you?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I wanna go home.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
You wasn't saying that
back at the house, was you?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Was you? Because you wanted
to see  Soul Plane 2.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Well, this is how
we see  Soul Plane 2.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
I repeat, the terrorist said
his name is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
and he's demanding
that we --

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Hell, no, I ain't fitting to ask him

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
for his motherfucking autograph.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
HUEY: An hour into the movie,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I wasn't sure how much more I could take.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
MAN: We out of food, but we got

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
one bag of 'tato chips.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yo. Look out.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Pass this bag of potato chips around.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Please take one. Pass it...

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
He's in here.
I know Robert.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
He don't miss a coon flick.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
What is it?
What's happening?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Shh. Don't make a sound.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
:  Ooh.
Damn.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Let's go check Madea's Bat Mitzvah.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
MAN:  Attention, please, passengers.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
If you left the toilet seat up in the restroom...

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Officer,
I'm sorry.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I didn't mean to steal
from the stuntman.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
What were you about to do?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
You were about to rat on us,
weren't you?

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
This is what the movie theater
industry wants, Jazmine.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Us fighting against
each other.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh-ho-ho-ho, no.
There's no turning back now.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You're in it
all the way.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Now you're gonna get your little
narrow, high-yellow ass

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
back into the theater
and enjoy  Soul Plane 2.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I...wanna...go...home!

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Shut up.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
You're ruining
my innocence!

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Shut up.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
MAN: I expected to fly first-class.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I wanna go home.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
MAN 2: Well, you ain't in first class.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Look at this.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Granddad. What's wrong
with Jazmine?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
She's fine.
Watch the movie.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Oh, that's crazy.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Look at this.
I...wanna...go...home.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
HUEY: Granddad had to be stopped.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm gonna put an end
to this...

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
or die trying.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
HUEY: And so did this movie.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Fortunately, I thought of a way to do both.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Move, nigga.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Where you going?
They're looking for us.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Huey, come back.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh, this is crazy.
Colored folks are something.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
HUEY:  My plan was to get to the projector room

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
and destroy the print of  Soul Plane.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
First, I had to go to the bathroom.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Jazmine, you're missing
all the best parts.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm not watching
a stolen movie.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Oh, well.
If you don't wanna laugh.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Oh, that's crazy.
What's so funny?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Oh, nothing. Hilarity
just ensued, that's all.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
It did?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Oh. Oh. Oh!

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
That was funny.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Hm? Ah.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
RUCKUS:
It's about impossible

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
to find his black ass

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
in this dark theater.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Yo. I think we need
to shake the spizzot.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Huh? What?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Forget Jazmine. Let's go.
But we couldn't.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
She the weak link.
She'll slow us down.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I mean, how could we?
Look, she a little girl.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
They're not gonna give her
no real time.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
She do what?
A couple months, tops.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
But we both got priors.
We gots to go.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Come on, Granddad.
We running out of time.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Sometimes,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
in order to save the day,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
people have to sacrifice
themselves,

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
you know what
I'm saying?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Oh, Air Marshal 50 Cent.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
You're so brave

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
to sacrifice yourself
to save us.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Not me, bitch. You.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh! Wait! Oh. Oh.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Hey. Hold this.
We be right back.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Okay.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Exactly. See,
what Marx is saying

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
is that the oppression
of the proletariat

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
is an essential facet
of the exploitation

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
inherent in the system.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
So therefore,
due to the class --

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
You little
half-and-half.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
HUEY: Oh, man.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
He's in there.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
What--? What happened
to my--?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Damn.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
He's right there!

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Hey!

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
GUARD: Yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
RUCKUS: Ah...

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I been waiting
on this day

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
since your little uppity ass
came into town.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
You won't kill me, Air Marshal 50 Cent.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
You'll only die trying.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Or, uh, I'm, uh--

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Or...

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Or I'm gonna die...

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
trying.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
What? What?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
You thought you was the only one

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
who mastered the ancient
and deadly art of the nunchaku?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Here's 50.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Ah...

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Come,  negro-san.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That was great, Granddad.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Boy, I wish we could've seen
the end of that movie.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I don't know.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I feel bad for leaving Huey
and what's-her-name.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
They knew the risks.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So they might do
a little time.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
We see 'em when they get out.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Uh...it doesn't seem right.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm going back
and turning myself in.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Turn yourself--?
Man--

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Granddad, look, come on.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I mean, I love Huey.
Almost like a brother.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
But what's done is done.
We got to let go of the past.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
If he don't come back,
can I have his side of the room?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Ah, come on, Granddad.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You supposed to be setting
a better example.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
You just wait till
the manager gets here.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
He gonna throw the book
at both of y'all.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
This  is
the worst day...

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
of my entire life.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Told you.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Here's the guardian
for the kids.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
That's right,
Ruckus.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
We snuck
into the movie, too.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
We?  You said you was gonna
turn  yourself  in.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Please. Let the kids go.
I'll take responsibility.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Look like y'all
all going down.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
The manager's
not coming.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Cinema's closed
indefinitely.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Looks like everyone walked out.
Something about a union.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
What?
The manager ain't coming?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, call the police.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
The FBI.
Homeland Security.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
You mean,
we gonna let

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
this African hooliganism
go unpunished?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
You have problems, Mr. Freeman,
and you need help.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Thanks for coming back...

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
eventually.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Yo, you need to stop
snitching, Granddad.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Ah. Ow. Hey.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Why don't you call
social services

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
and turn yourself in
for child abuse?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Hey, man.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
You guys unionized and staged
a walkout that quickly?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
That's amazing.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh, yeah.
We unionized.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Then someone called
the corporate headquarters,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
and they shut down
the whole place.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Fired everybody.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Oh.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Well, um...

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
power to the people?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Fuck you.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Well, that's that.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I think we all learned
a valuable lesson today

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
about stealing movies.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Buy the bootleg.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Or just download it
from the Internet

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
like everybody else.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Hey. Can you guys wait
here a sec?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
There's something
I need to take care of.
