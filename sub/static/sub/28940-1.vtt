01:03:57.206 --> 01:03:58.344
or the spirits won't talk to us.

01:03:58.344 --> 01:03:59.413
- Yeah, she's right.

01:04:01.724 --> 01:04:03.793
- [Brunette Woman] Is
 there a spirit with--

01:04:03.793 --> 01:04:05.034
[group gasps]

01:04:05.034 --> 01:04:05.896
- Oh, my god, oh, my god.

01:04:05.896 --> 01:04:06.724
Oh, my god, oh, my god.

01:04:06.724 --> 01:04:07.551
- I.

01:04:09.965 --> 01:04:10.965
- [Group] M.

01:04:12.586 --> 01:04:13.482
H.

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.310
E.

01:04:15.206 --> 01:04:16.724
A.

01:04:16.724 --> 01:04:17.758
R.

01:04:17.758 --> 01:04:18.655
E.

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:19.862
- I am--

01:04:19.862 --> 01:04:20.689
- Here?

01:04:20.689 --> 01:04:21.620
- I am here?

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:22.862
- [Brunette Woman] I am here?

01:04:22.862 --> 01:04:26.206
- Spirit, did you mean
I am here like H-E-R-E?

01:04:30.896 --> 01:04:31.724
- Yes.

01:04:31.724 --> 01:04:32.586
- Oh, okay.

01:04:33.655 --> 01:04:34.896
- What do you want?

01:04:39.551 --> 01:04:40.551
- [Group] F.

01:04:43.344 --> 01:04:44.172
For.

01:04:47.344 --> 01:04:48.172
You.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.206
- For you to.

01:04:51.206 --> 01:04:52.000
- [Group] D.

01:04:53.034 --> 01:04:54.655
Y.

01:04:54.655 --> 01:04:55.517
E.

01:04:55.517 --> 01:04:57.482
For you to dye.

01:04:57.482 --> 01:04:58.310
- Dye?

01:04:58.310 --> 01:04:59.137
- Dye?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.206
- I'm sorry.

01:05:02.206 --> 01:05:06.862
Spirit, do you mean
for us to dye our hair?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Because if not,
 it's spelled D-I-E.

01:05:22.275 --> 01:05:23.103
- Oh!

01:05:25.275 --> 01:05:26.586
- Your doomed?

01:05:26.586 --> 01:05:27.965
My doomed what?

01:05:27.965 --> 01:05:29.310
My doomed what?

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:33.827
- I think it meant
 you're, like you are.

01:05:33.827 --> 01:05:35.068
- No.

01:05:35.068 --> 01:05:36.344
No, I hate it when
 your gets confused

01:05:36.344 --> 01:05:38.413
with Y-O-U apostrophe R-E.

01:05:38.413 --> 01:05:41.068
[group screams]

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.965
- There, you're doomed.

01:05:54.586 --> 01:05:55.413
- What?

01:05:55.413 --> 01:05:56.241
- What?

01:05:57.379 --> 01:06:00.379
- Stop embarrassing me?

01:06:00.379 --> 01:06:03.482
Oh, god, it's so painful!

01:06:03.482 --> 01:06:04.827
- We'll take you
to the hospital.

01:06:04.827 --> 01:06:07.689
- No, no, the misspelling
 is so painful.

01:06:14.965 --> 01:06:15.793
- Oh!

01:06:22.482 --> 01:06:24.000
- Man, you're
 embarrassing yourself!

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.310
- Yeah, we'll stop correcting
 you when you learn to spell.

01:06:32.241 --> 01:06:34.310
- [Group] Than.

01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:35.551
- Than, you will pay.

01:06:35.551 --> 01:06:38.137
No, spirit, it's T-H-E-N.

01:06:38.137 --> 01:06:39.793
E!

01:06:39.793 --> 01:06:42.137
- Yeah, then is a conjunction.

01:06:42.137 --> 01:06:45.517
You would use then in
this situation because,

01:06:49.413 --> 01:06:53.310
because you're not connecting
 two sentences together.

01:06:54.724 --> 01:06:59.482
- I'm not someone
 who you should mock.

01:07:03.413 --> 01:07:05.206
- It's whom.

01:07:05.206 --> 01:07:06.310
- [Spirit] What?

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:08.482
- It's actually whom.

01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:10.793
- I'm not someone you
 whom you should mock!

01:07:13.482 --> 01:07:15.724
- Who is a subject pronoun!

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:27.448
- You chose the wrong
 demon to mess with.

01:07:27.448 --> 01:07:30.965
- Never end a sentence
 with a preposition.

01:07:43.137 --> 01:07:46.034
- Can you believe this?

01:07:48.689 --> 01:07:49.517
- Horrifying.

01:07:55.103 --> 01:07:57.000
Apostrophe shouldn't be there.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.724
[spirit screams]

01:08:17.103 --> 01:08:22.103
[flies buzzing]
 [creature groaning]

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:17.862
- How was that?

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:21.412
Was that like too
 much gurgling or?

01:09:23.136 --> 01:09:25.000
- No, no, no, it was fine.

01:09:26.103 --> 01:09:26.965
- Okay.

01:09:30.379 --> 01:09:34.412
Oh, hey, any chance I could
 get my SAG card after this?

01:09:34.412 --> 01:09:36.136
- Yeah, and I'll be getting
 my acceptance letter

01:09:36.136 --> 01:09:37.895
to the Directors
 Guild any day now.

01:09:41.482 --> 01:09:43.000
Hey, look on the bright side.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.241
You get to work with the
 world-famous Father Lance.

01:09:45.241 --> 01:09:46.965
You'll be saved from
 the forces of darkness

01:09:46.965 --> 01:09:48.551
in front of millions of viewers.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.000
- Where do you want the
rest of these cables?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.033
- They're fine where they are.

01:09:54.033 --> 01:09:55.344
Just make sure you're wired up.

01:09:55.344 --> 01:09:57.862
And don't forget to mic
up our starlet here.

01:10:06.896 --> 01:10:09.000
- Do you want me to moan more?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.827
I can, like no problem.

01:10:11.827 --> 01:10:13.620
- You're doing fine, Hailey.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:15.034
- Okay, it's Heather.

01:10:24.172 --> 01:10:26.103
- [Woman] Morons,
 keep it classy, okay?

01:10:29.068 --> 01:10:31.724
We'll only go for
 the table service.

01:10:31.724 --> 01:10:33.862
- Hey, freshie, get ready.

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:35.448
We're hitting Landa in 30.

01:10:35.448 --> 01:10:36.379
- You guys go without me.

01:10:36.379 --> 01:10:38.482
I'll meet you there.

01:10:38.482 --> 01:10:40.379
- You're gonna miss free game.

01:10:40.379 --> 01:10:41.172
- Children.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.379
- [Woman] What is
 she even watching?

01:10:44.379 --> 01:10:45.517
- [Woman] Some spirit shit?

01:10:45.517 --> 01:10:50.482
- [Woman] Drink up.

01:11:23.689 --> 01:11:26.000
- Bryce, you want
 me to take it away?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
- But dad, The Cleansing
Hour's almost on.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.206
- First, you finish your dinner.

01:11:30.206 --> 01:11:31.482
Vegetables too, come on.

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:41.103
- Goddammit, Lance.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.551
- [Lance] Somebody
 call for an exorcist?

01:11:49.758 --> 01:11:51.000
Well, hey, sugar.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:51.827
- [Drew] Where the hell
have you been, man?

01:11:51.827 --> 01:11:53.034
We're live in four.

01:11:53.034 --> 01:11:55.551
- I was counseling?

01:11:55.551 --> 01:11:57.103
- Is that fucking lipstick?

01:11:57.103 --> 01:11:58.689
- Oh.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:00.827
Oh, you know, you can't
resist a man in uniform.

01:12:00.827 --> 01:12:02.724
- Tell me again why I
 put up with your shit.

01:12:02.724 --> 01:12:04.689
- I'll give you five million
 reasons and climbing.

01:12:04.689 --> 01:12:06.068
- Yeah, and if one
 of those reasons

01:12:06.068 --> 01:12:08.103
happens to snap a pic of
Father Lance with his hand down

01:12:08.103 --> 01:12:10.103
some IHOP waitress's
 skirt, we're done.

01:12:10.103 --> 01:12:11.103
It's over.

01:12:11.103 --> 01:12:13.137
- Drew, that's offensive.

01:12:13.137 --> 01:12:14.103
I'm a Denny's man.

01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:16.724
- Would you watch it?

01:12:16.724 --> 01:12:17.758
That's our lifeline.

01:12:17.758 --> 01:12:19.482
- What is your deal today?

01:12:19.482 --> 01:12:20.758
- I think he's
 just trying to say

01:12:20.758 --> 01:12:22.965
you should show more
respect for technology.

01:12:26.034 --> 01:12:27.517
- Who the fuck is that guy?

01:12:27.517 --> 01:12:29.793
- Braden, sound.

01:12:31.379 --> 01:12:33.000
- What happened to Chris?

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.103
- He's under the weather,
 asked me to fill in.

01:12:35.103 --> 01:12:37.482
- Okay, well, just don't
 get your boom in my shot,

01:12:37.482 --> 01:12:39.344
and make sure you
 sign an NDA form.

01:12:39.344 --> 01:12:40.413
Wow!

01:12:40.413 --> 01:12:42.551
Forgive me, Lord, I have sinned.

01:12:42.551 --> 01:12:43.689
It's been 90 seconds.

01:12:43.689 --> 01:12:45.000
I haven't introduced myself.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:45.862
I'm Lance.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:48.931
- Heather. [giggles]

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:49.862
Nice to meet you.

01:12:49.862 --> 01:12:51.655
- Heather is a beautiful name.

01:12:51.655 --> 01:12:53.413
He's gonna shove
 these up your nose.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.172
- I'm gonna place
 these in your nose.

01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:58.689
They'll dissolve after five
 minutes, instant nosebleed.

01:12:58.689 --> 01:12:59.827
- Drew will direct you.

01:13:01.034 --> 01:13:02.000
- [Heather] Thank you.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.172
- I'm just gonna move your hair

01:13:03.172 --> 01:13:04.206
so I can put this in your hair.

01:13:04.206 --> 01:13:05.034
- Okay.

01:13:09.275 --> 01:13:10.724
Ooh.

01:13:10.724 --> 01:13:13.103
- Sorry, it's always
 the most awkward part.

01:13:13.103 --> 01:13:13.965
- No problem.

01:13:17.827 --> 01:13:19.310
- [Lance] This looks legit.

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:20.310
Where did it come from?

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:21.586
- I found it at a garage sale.

01:13:21.586 --> 01:13:22.413
30 seconds.

01:13:22.413 --> 01:13:24.034
Take your mark, padre.

01:13:24.034 --> 01:13:25.620
- Alright, guys, let's
 make it a quick one.

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.000
I've got a date with
 Destiny tonight,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:28.931
probably not her real name.

01:13:28.931 --> 01:13:30.137
- Oh, Jesus.

01:13:30.137 --> 01:13:31.793
- Drew, don't take the
 Lord's name in vain.

01:13:31.793 --> 01:13:33.034
- Okay, 10 seconds.

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:33.896
Ready, Heather?

01:13:37.034 --> 01:13:39.103
Okay, in three, two, one.

01:13:45.586 --> 01:13:46.827
- [Lance Voiceover]
 I cast you out

01:13:46.827 --> 01:13:48.310
in the name of the
 Lord, Jesus Christ.

01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:53.344
You are at the mercy
 of the creator.

01:13:56.413 --> 01:13:59.068
[woman screams]

01:14:03.413 --> 01:14:05.310
Welcome to The Cleansing Hour.

01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:08.862
I am Father Lance, your guide
 through these troubling times.

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:13.862
Tonight, we bring you
 Sabrina, an innocent soul

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.482
tortured by the only
family she'd ever known.

01:14:17.482 --> 01:14:20.448
Molested by her father,
beaten by her mother,

01:14:20.448 --> 01:14:23.344
Sabrina sought escape
 from her unimaginable pain

01:14:23.344 --> 01:14:28.206
in the form of drugs, alcohol,
 and ultimately, prostitution.

01:14:29.172 --> 01:14:31.172
- [Woman] I will not [mumbles]

01:14:31.172 --> 01:14:32.000
- Shh!

01:14:32.862 --> 01:14:34.034
- Wow.

01:14:34.034 --> 01:14:36.482
Well, anyway, so
 it's Josh and Kyle.

01:14:36.482 --> 01:14:38.862
- The enemy of God
 exploited her frailty

01:14:38.862 --> 01:14:40.413
and took control of her body.

01:14:40.413 --> 01:14:44.448
But tonight, by the grace
 of God, with my help

01:14:44.448 --> 01:14:48.931
and your prayers, Sabrina
 will be rid of this evil.

01:14:51.379 --> 01:14:52.310
- Okay, that's great, Heather.

01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:53.551
Just keep your head down.

01:14:53.551 --> 01:14:56.275
Whatever they can't
 see will terrify them.

01:14:56.275 --> 01:15:00.793
- In nomine Patris et
 Filii et Spiritus Sancti.

01:15:01.827 --> 01:15:02.655
- [Drew] Right, great, Heather.

01:15:02.655 --> 01:15:04.413
Now try and bite him.

01:15:06.344 --> 01:15:09.724
- Sabrina is exhibiting
incredible strength
and aggression.

01:15:09.724 --> 01:15:12.103
This could be a stage
 four possession.

01:15:14.448 --> 01:15:18.172
I command you, unclean
spirit, by the mysteries

01:15:18.172 --> 01:15:21.137
of the incarnation,
 passion, the resurrection,

01:15:21.137 --> 01:15:23.827
and the ascension of
our Lord, Jesus Christ,

01:15:23.827 --> 01:15:27.310
that you tell me our name
 and obey me to the letter.

01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:28.827
Speak your name, demon.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.896
- Okay, Heather, your
 demon name is Slubgob.

01:15:35.896 --> 01:15:37.137
Repeat, Slubgob.

01:15:41.689 --> 01:15:42.862
- Your name, demon.

01:15:43.724 --> 01:15:44.586
Speak!

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.620
- Damn, Heather, very nice.

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:54.551
- Tell me your name in the
name of our Lord, Jesus Christ!

01:16:01.206 --> 01:16:06.206
- We are Thoth, collector
 of fractured souls.

01:16:07.655 --> 01:16:11.172
Soon, we'll be thousands in
 number, limitless in strength.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.206
- Just go with it.

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:19.965
She said her name was Thoth.

01:16:19.965 --> 01:16:21.793
Heather, I appreciate
 your enthusiasm,

01:16:21.793 --> 01:16:23.344
but please stick to the script.

01:16:26.655 --> 01:16:28.655
- [Lance] Our father
 who art in heaven,

01:16:28.655 --> 01:16:29.758
hallowed be thy name.

01:16:29.758 --> 01:16:31.000
Thy kingdom come--

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.172
- What on earth are
 you two watching?

01:16:40.517 --> 01:16:45.517
- Thoth, a foreign slime
 of hell, servant of Satan,

01:16:46.379 --> 01:16:48.862
see the cross of the Lord Jesus

01:16:48.862 --> 01:16:51.758
and submit to the
 authority of the almighty.

01:16:53.517 --> 01:16:56.103
Fight, Sabrina, fight!

01:16:56.103 --> 01:16:57.551
Do not give in!

01:16:57.551 --> 01:16:58.379
Fight!

01:17:09.586 --> 01:17:10.413
- That wasn't me.

01:17:13.413 --> 01:17:14.448
It must have slipped.

01:17:16.344 --> 01:17:18.275
- Fuck you, deceiver.

01:17:18.275 --> 01:17:20.137
Fuck you in front of the masses.

01:17:20.137 --> 01:17:23.344
You worship the world and
 the bounty of the vice.

01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:26.448
You're nothing but a pawn in
 the eyes of the great one.

01:17:26.448 --> 01:17:28.034
- Silence!

01:17:28.034 --> 01:17:29.586
Silence, demon!

01:17:29.586 --> 01:17:32.931
I cast you out in the name
 of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

01:17:32.931 --> 01:17:34.655
Be gone and depart from Sabrina

01:17:34.655 --> 01:17:36.931
who is but an innocent
 creature of God,

01:17:38.413 --> 01:17:42.172
for it is he who commands
 you, he who flung you

01:17:42.172 --> 01:17:45.517
from the heights of heaven
 to the depths of hell!.

01:17:45.517 --> 01:17:46.862
- What the fuck?

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:51.793
- Is that you?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.379
Harken therefore
 and tremble in fear

01:18:00.896 --> 01:18:05.000
for you are at the mercy of
 the creator of all things.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.551
Submit and depart from us!

01:18:12.379 --> 01:18:15.000
[Thoth growls]

01:18:17.586 --> 01:18:18.965
- Oh, shit.

01:18:18.965 --> 01:18:19.793
Heather?

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
We've got a problem.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:27.862
Something's wrong.

01:18:27.862 --> 01:18:28.689
Heather?

01:18:29.862 --> 01:18:31.896
I don't think she's acting.

01:18:31.896 --> 01:18:33.551
I gotta end transmission.

01:18:33.551 --> 01:18:35.000
- Don't you dare.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Look at the numbers.

01:18:37.103 --> 01:18:38.896
- Help me, Father Lance, please!

01:18:40.896 --> 01:18:42.551
- We gotta fix this.

01:18:43.793 --> 01:18:45.413
- Don't break the fourth wall.

01:18:45.413 --> 01:18:47.206
- 13 million people are
 gonna watch this girl die.

01:18:47.206 --> 01:18:48.793
Who do you think
 they're gonna blame?

01:18:48.793 --> 01:18:50.896
- Help, me, Father Lance.

01:18:52.965 --> 01:18:54.620
- Give me the book.

01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.827
I'm the exorcist, right?

01:18:58.724 --> 01:18:59.551
- Read it out loud.

01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:00.827
- Yeah.

01:19:00.827 --> 01:19:03.000
- [Thoth] [laughs]
 Help me, Father Lance.

01:19:09.068 --> 01:19:11.655
[Thoth laughs]

01:19:19.689 --> 01:19:20.517
- Repel,

01:19:25.137 --> 01:19:28.000
repel, oh Lord,
 the devil's power.

01:19:29.413 --> 01:19:31.724
Break asunder his
 snares and traps.

01:19:34.448 --> 01:19:36.379
Put the unholy
 tempter to flight.

01:19:39.344 --> 01:19:41.517
I cast you out, demon!

01:19:41.517 --> 01:19:43.551
Be gone, be gone, be gone.

01:19:43.551 --> 01:19:46.965
Depart from us, in the
 name of Jesus Christ.

01:19:48.241 --> 01:19:49.241
Be gone!

01:19:50.793 --> 01:19:53.620
[Heather screams]

01:20:07.931 --> 01:20:08.758
Sabrina,

01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:13.586
are you with us?

01:20:25.034 --> 01:20:27.655
Sabrina?

01:20:27.655 --> 01:20:32.655
Sabrina, are you with us?

01:20:37.724 --> 01:20:39.379
Sabrina?

01:20:39.379 --> 01:20:40.551
Sabrina, are you,

01:20:40.551 --> 01:20:41.793
are you with us?

01:20:50.068 --> 01:20:54.620
- Are you with us?

01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:57.137
[Lance grunts]

01:20:59.965 --> 01:21:01.344
- Get her off me!

01:21:07.275 --> 01:21:08.172
Drew, help!

01:21:09.068 --> 01:21:09.965
- [Drew] I'll get her legs.

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:11.931
I'll get her legs.

01:21:11.931 --> 01:21:14.482
- [Lance] What the fuck!

01:21:14.482 --> 01:21:15.413
- [Drew] I got her legs.

01:21:15.413 --> 01:21:16.241
I got her legs.

01:21:16.241 --> 01:21:18.241
- [Lance] What the fuck!

01:21:44.413 --> 01:21:45.241
- What happened?

01:21:45.241 --> 01:21:46.068
Did I do the job?

01:21:49.862 --> 01:21:51.000
- You did good, Heather.

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:53.758
You did good.

01:21:53.758 --> 01:21:54.655
- I did it.

01:21:55.758 --> 01:21:57.103
I fuckin' did it.

01:22:21.206 --> 01:22:24.206
[suspenseful music]

01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:58.413
[gunshot blasts]
