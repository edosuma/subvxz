00:17.450 --> 00:19.475
Ray...

00:20.520 --> 00:22.283
It's conforming.

00:22.422 --> 00:24.322
It's not conforming.

00:24.457 --> 00:25.481
It's saying you own me.

00:26.693 --> 00:27.990
That's an old-fashioned way
of looking at things.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.255
I don't want to be a possession.

00:30.397 --> 00:32.592
Marriage is about...

00:32.732 --> 00:33.721
Iove and commitment,

00:33.867 --> 00:36.028
not possession, baby.

00:36.169 --> 00:40.128
Don't you want kids? Sunday dinners?

00:40.273 --> 00:42.298
I like Sunday dinners.

00:44.344 --> 00:49.441
Tying the knot would guarantee me
front-row seats to the movie of your life.

00:49.582 --> 00:52.107
Don't you want someone to...

00:52.252 --> 00:53.947
change your diapers
when you get old?

00:54.087 --> 00:56.521
Baby, if I ever need diapers,

00:56.656 --> 00:58.783
You just take me right out back
and shoot me.

01:00.627 --> 01:02.492
Don't do it, son.

01:04.096 --> 01:06.122
What are you saying?

01:06.266 --> 01:07.597
Marriage.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.928
Ruin your life.

01:11.838 --> 01:13.533
Why don't you ring these up?

01:14.808 --> 01:16.708
You get married, the romance fizzles,

01:16.843 --> 01:19.311
your girl gets fat.

01:19.446 --> 01:20.879
Next thing you know,
you're lying on a couch

01:21.014 --> 01:23.039
wondering how come
you don't have a bed.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.879
Marriage is overrated.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.782
Marriage is overrated.

01:48.708 --> 01:49.902
How's it going, stranger?

01:50.043 --> 01:53.035
Oh, I'm a little tired.
I went salsa dancing last night.

01:53.179 --> 01:56.012
Oh, my God, like I need another reason
to find you amazing.

01:56.149 --> 01:59.778
This call for you from Sean McAllister
came to my phone accidentally.

01:59.919 --> 02:02.114
He sounded very hot
and very important.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.745
- Did he leave a message?
- No. But it's from Paris.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.085
A Scottish guy calling from Paris.
Know this, Emily...

02:06.226 --> 02:08.285
even if he is ugly,
Scottish guys are hot.

02:08.428 --> 02:10.020
- It's the accent.
- I'll keep that in mind.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.256
So what's the skinny?
Is he an ex?

02:12.398 --> 02:13.490
International booty call?

02:13.633 --> 02:14.691
No. He's a friend.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.131
Where's Seaver?

02:16.269 --> 02:17.896
She had to take a test at the academy.

02:18.037 --> 02:19.504
I know we've all seen the news.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.231
Mass murder in Miles City, Montana.

02:21.374 --> 02:23.706
Six people shot and killed
at a gas station.

02:23.843 --> 02:25.777
- Robbery?
- No apparent motive.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.004
Any security footage?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.671
No. No cameras, no witnesses.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.180
Ballistics say we're looking
at two shooters.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.476
Well, something at the station
must have triggered them.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.313
It doesn't look like
they had much of a plan.

02:33.453 --> 02:34.511
And it may happen again.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.747
Spree killers often repeat themselves.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.485
We did it, baby.

03:15.628 --> 03:16.925
Mmm.

03:17.063 --> 03:18.325
We did it.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.166
Mmm...

03:33.880 --> 03:35.871
Aah!

03:36.015 --> 03:37.346
Whoo!

03:43.890 --> 03:44.879
Whoo!

03:45.024 --> 03:47.254
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

03:47.393 --> 03:49.987
That was awesome.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.063
I love you, Ray.

03:53.199 --> 03:54.860
Love you, too, Syd.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.178
<i>Friedrich Nietzsche wrote,</i>

04:43.316 --> 04:46.308
<i>"What really raises one's indignation</i>
<i>against suffering</i>

04:46.452 --> 04:48.317
<i>"is not suffering intrinsically,</i>

04:48.454 --> 04:51.150
<i>but the senselessness of suffering. "</i>

04:55.628 --> 04:57.425
I'm sorry to reroute you to Billings,

04:57.563 --> 04:59.030
but last night this went down.

04:59.165 --> 05:00.564
Have you released
a statement to the press?

05:00.700 --> 05:02.258
No, but it's already hit the air.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.029
- Where's the car they dumped?
- It's over there.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.137
Agents are searching it now.

05:05.271 --> 05:08.035
One of the vics said the shooters
were a male and a female.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.271
How many people were murdered here?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.778
Eight. And if you add
the Miles City killings, we're up to 14.

05:19.919 --> 05:23.286
Male-female teams are usually
committed to pleasing each other,

05:23.423 --> 05:25.050
both mentally and physically.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.215
These guys are thrill killers.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.621
They're aroused
by the adrenaline rush.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.421
So they're not gonna stop
until we catch them.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.928
So this is just foreplay.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.700
<i>What's the news saying about us now?</i>

06:15.842 --> 06:17.867
<i>They know we're male and female.</i>

06:18.010 --> 06:20.410
<i>How did they figure that out?</i>

06:20.546 --> 06:21.843
 <i>I don't know.</i>

06:21.981 --> 06:24.381
<i>There was nothing girly about</i>
<i>the way we killed those people.</i>

06:28.454 --> 06:30.718
<i>Where do you want to live, Ray?</i>

06:30.857 --> 06:33.655
<i>I told you... Aruba.</i>

06:33.793 --> 06:35.021
<i>Right on the ocean.</i>

06:38.364 --> 06:40.161
 <i>I like the ocean.</i>

06:43.269 --> 06:46.727
<i>So how do you want to spend</i>
<i>the rest of our honeymoon?</i>

06:49.409 --> 06:53.903
<i>Exactly the same way</i>
<i>that we spent the last 12 months.</i>

07:03.890 --> 07:06.654
<i>Till death do us part.</i>

07:06.793 --> 07:09.227
<i>Nothing's gonna happen to us, Syd.</i>

07:23.242 --> 07:25.608
I mean, I've seen dead bodies before,
but this is insane.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.235
They're like Bonnie and Clyde.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.870
They smashed
one guy's vertebrae so bad,

07:29.015 --> 07:30.346
It looked like a derailed train.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.643
Extreme brutality to this degree

07:31.784 --> 07:33.342
is what's known as
an obliteration attack.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.784
The unsub wants to completely
erase these victims from existence.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.257
Both of the vics were shot
at point blank range.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.417
What made those?

07:41.561 --> 07:43.495
That was a crowbar.

07:50.436 --> 07:52.734
- Baby!
- Ray, I'm hungry.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.806
The unsubs are becoming
more and more confident,

07:54.941 --> 07:57.034
which means their weapons
are becoming more and more personal.

07:57.176 --> 07:58.768
The excitement of the brutality

07:58.911 --> 08:00.276
allows them to overcome
their human inhibitions.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.846
- Why is this one covered?
- It's the store clerk.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.108
Guy got it pretty bad.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.582
In medieval times, it would
just be another Monday.

08:06.719 --> 08:07.947
He was sodomized with a tire iron.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.578
That kind of overkill suggests
he was the root of their aggression.

08:10.723 --> 08:13.556
Maybe they're zeroing in on
what's really pissing them off.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.763
They took the store owner in the back.

08:19.765 --> 08:22.199
They got the schoolteacher over here.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.927
The kid over here thought he was safe.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.828
Why chain them in?

08:26.973 --> 08:28.907
They thrive on sadistic power.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.441
There's rice all over the floor.

08:31.577 --> 08:32.874
Bullet probably hit a box.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.842
I take it this is the food aisle.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.677
I don't see rice for sale
anywhere on these shelves.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.182
Who comes to a gas station
throwing rice?

08:39.318 --> 08:40.784
Okay, I checked surrounding areas.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.717
72 people applied
for marriage licenses

08:42.855 --> 08:44.584
<i>in Montana in the last three days.</i>

08:44.724 --> 08:45.816
Any of them have records?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.619
<i>31 do, rest are clean.</i>

08:47.760 --> 08:50.490
All right. Send over all the names
of the suspects with their ages, Garcia.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.531
Lover, they're already sent.
Check your phones.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.065
So you think they're newlyweds?

08:55.201 --> 08:56.634
Well, there was rice
all over the crime scene,

08:56.769 --> 08:58.236
and a bunch of alcohol
was missing from the store.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.531
So they're on their honeymoon.

08:59.672 --> 09:01.162
What did you find out from the M. E?

09:01.307 --> 09:04.174
Overkill on the store clerk
and sodomy... object penetration.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.870
Garcia, last 30 days,
check any store clerks killed

09:07.013 --> 09:08.776
<i>in the states east of Montana.</i>

09:10.650 --> 09:13.642
Wow. Uh, there was
a savagely beaten store clerk

09:13.786 --> 09:15.754
outside Jamestown
at the beginning of the month,

09:15.888 --> 09:16.912
and then another one

09:17.056 --> 09:18.683
<i>2 days later in Bowman, North Dakota.</i>

09:18.824 --> 09:20.189
And that's probably where they started.

09:20.326 --> 09:21.520
Thanks, Garcia.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.505
Mmm.

09:39.645 --> 09:40.976
Hey, there.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.783
Are you drinking
all alone tonight, honey?

09:45.918 --> 09:48.546
My company's a little busy.

09:48.688 --> 09:50.519
Hi. My name's Ray.

09:50.656 --> 09:53.250
Hi, Ray.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.326
I just got married.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.224
And I'm an alcoholic.

09:57.363 --> 09:59.388
Congratulations.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.022
I'm just passing through town,

10:01.167 --> 10:04.068
and I wanted to stop and share
because I partied last night.

10:04.203 --> 10:05.568
What do you think made you drink?

10:05.705 --> 10:07.036
Come on.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.835
I was celebrating with my lady.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.807
That's a big rock you got
on your finger there.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.345
Hmm.

10:21.587 --> 10:23.214
I like things big.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.991
I bet you do.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.594
Mmm.

10:29.729 --> 10:32.596
Well, I've been drinking my whole life.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.529
I started when I was 8.

10:38.704 --> 10:40.604
My father was an alcoholic.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.733
It tastes like...

10:44.877 --> 10:46.845
grape Kool-Aid.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.812
Oh, I like Kool-Aid.

10:50.950 --> 10:53.009
Whiskey and bourbon...

10:54.687 --> 10:56.177
were his choice.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.824
After he got his glass,
he's come and he'd tuck me in.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.824
First, he'd ask me about my day.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.963
Then he'd, like...
he'd move his hands up my leg.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.308
Told me everything was gonna be okay.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.608
It was never okay.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.745
20 bucks...

11:25.885 --> 11:28.080
I'll let you have a taste.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.314
Oh, you got a deal.

11:34.927 --> 11:38.294
I'd just bury my head into my pillow
and wait until it was over.

11:41.067 --> 11:44.764
And when he was done,
I'd just lie there quietly.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.531
Ohh!

12:10.863 --> 12:13.423
It's nice of you to share with us, Ray.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.124
What step have you gotten to?

12:16.969 --> 12:18.027
7.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.330
The same age I was
when he did that to me.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.911
Well, it's time for you to do 8 and 9.

12:26.045 --> 12:27.842
Have you admitted your shortcomings?

12:35.554 --> 12:37.749
This wasn't my fault.

12:37.890 --> 12:41.690
But you've let this one incident
dictate your whole life.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.993
- I was a kid.
- I know, Ray.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.734
But until you let this go,

12:55.875 --> 12:58.469
you will always be a victim to the bottle.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.806
<i>To the bottle, to the bottle...</i>

13:03.349 --> 13:04.475
Screw you and your bottle.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.903
What happened to him?

13:33.045 --> 13:34.945
He got fresh with me.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.445
Whoo!

13:42.555 --> 13:43.715
Whoo!

13:48.627 --> 13:50.424
This is 100 miles west
of the last gas station.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.191
We anticipated them
hitting this area, but not here.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.800
Maybe this guy tried to have sex
with one of our unsubs

13:55.935 --> 13:57.061
while the other one was inside.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.830
Cheating on your honeymoon.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.201
Someone's got a twisted sense
of commitment.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.073
So they steal the liquor
from the gas station,

14:05.211 --> 14:07.736
they go on a binge,
and then they come to a meeting?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.610
What if the unsubs met at a meeting?

14:10.749 --> 14:12.114
They hear each other's stories

14:12.251 --> 14:15.152
and develop a bond
because of their similar backgrounds.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.482
That makes sense.
People typically drink to excess

14:17.623 --> 14:19.716
because they're unhappy
with themselves or their past.

14:19.859 --> 14:20.985
From the looks of it,

14:21.126 --> 14:23.720
at least one of the unsubs
shot from up front.

14:26.932 --> 14:27.990
Come on!

14:28.133 --> 14:31.625
Well, if the meeting started at 8
and this happened at 8:45,

14:31.770 --> 14:33.704
they were probably in
the sharing portion of the meeting.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.739
So maybe they didn't
come in here to kill.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.366
You know, what if they really
are struggling with sobriety?

14:38.510 --> 14:39.909
If they're really working the program,

14:40.045 --> 14:41.672
they could be working
on the hardest steps.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.543
- Which are?
- 7, 8, and 9.

14:43.682 --> 14:46.310
Acknowledge your shortcomings,
accept responsibility, and make amends.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.181
The trouble is,
these unsubs already broke

14:48.320 --> 14:49.287
one of the most important steps.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.389
- What's that?
- The thirteenth step.

14:51.523 --> 14:53.081
Members aren't supposed
to enter relationships with each other

14:53.225 --> 14:55.125
while trying to get sober.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.827
What are you thinking about?

15:01.967 --> 15:03.901
We need to go to the next step.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.762
All this killing and drinking is fun,

15:07.907 --> 15:11.934
but it doesn't change
the fact that, you know,

15:12.077 --> 15:13.203
my father used to rape me

15:13.345 --> 15:15.074
or what your daddy
did to you, you know?

15:15.214 --> 15:17.011
What are you saying, Syd?

15:17.149 --> 15:20.016
If you want to find closure,

15:20.152 --> 15:22.780
you gotta go directly to the source.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.251
Do 8 and 9?

15:28.460 --> 15:29.859
Why not?

15:29.995 --> 15:32.259
We're looking for a young couple
from North Dakota,

15:32.398 --> 15:33.729
late teens to mid-20s.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.697
We believe they may have
recently been married.

15:36.735 --> 15:39.863
We're seeing that alcohol plays
a significant role in these crimes.

15:40.005 --> 15:42.769
It's allowing them
to kill freely and recklessly.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.876
Our unsubs are killing surrogates

15:45.010 --> 15:47.706
who represent those responsible
for deep-seated wounds.

15:47.846 --> 15:50.007
Now, these two most likely
met at alcohol support.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.310
And they get a sexual
charge out of the kill.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.043
The change from gas station

15:54.186 --> 15:55.778
to alcohol support meetings

15:55.921 --> 15:58.321
suggests one of them might
have a slight moral compass

15:58.457 --> 16:00.118
that led them to get help.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.658
Ultimately,
we believe one of the pair

16:01.794 --> 16:04.490
Is a sociopath,
while the other is a psychopath.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.325
What's really the difference?

16:06.465 --> 16:08.797
They're similar pathologies,
but a sociopath

16:08.934 --> 16:11.266
is less likely to participate
in criminal activity

16:11.403 --> 16:12.370
and can be lured by a dominant,

16:12.504 --> 16:14.995
while a psychopath
is a consummate leader

16:15.140 --> 16:17.700
and likely to engage
and destroy anyone in their way.

16:17.843 --> 16:19.868
The most recent attack
was 12 hours ago,

16:20.012 --> 16:23.072
which means they're most likely
heading west of Helena towards Idaho.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.648
All surrounding areas
should be on alert.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.357
This is it?

16:34.493 --> 16:36.085
This is it.

16:36.228 --> 16:38.059
This is it. This is your house.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.929
Say hi to me, baby.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.467
- Hi, baby.
- You look good.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.538
This is Ray's house.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.405
Hi, baby. Kiss me.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.974
Lookin' good, baby.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.088
Mmm. Cute butt.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.792
Yeah, can I help you?

17:17.368 --> 17:18.631
Raymond.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.970
Say cheese.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.838
Hi, Daddy.

17:30.949 --> 17:33.076
Ray. Ray. No.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.284
Because alcohol support groups
are based on anonymity,

17:37.423 --> 17:39.152
there'll be no record
of who attended the meeting.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.091
Garcia,

17:41.226 --> 17:44.161
<i>our unsubs attended</i>
<i>an alcohol support meeting</i>

17:44.296 --> 17:45.422
<i>last night, but they're</i>
<i>not from the area.</i>

17:45.564 --> 17:48.328
Can you trace who accessed
their website yesterday?

17:48.467 --> 17:50.560
Three people went to that website...

17:50.702 --> 17:52.101
one on a mobile, two on DSL.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.569
Cross-check that with a list
of anyone married in Montana

17:54.706 --> 17:55.764
<i>in the last two days.</i>

17:55.908 --> 17:57.842
No, no, I'm coming up empty.

17:57.976 --> 18:01.070
See if anyone on the list who accessed
the site is from North Dakota.

18:01.213 --> 18:04.410
Uh, bingo, baby.
Ray Donovan of Devil's Lake.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.313
- Ironic.
- What's his story?

18:06.452 --> 18:07.578
He is 27.

18:07.719 --> 18:10.187
He's been in and out of foster care
since he was 10.

18:10.322 --> 18:12.552
He looks like kind of a lush
and a bit of a meanie.

18:12.691 --> 18:14.318
He's had two DUls
in the last two years.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.826
He was slapped with
a restraining order by an ex-girlfriend.

18:16.962 --> 18:18.429
Sounds like our boy.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.088
What's her name?
She might be his partner.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.757
No, she's not.
Her name's Amy Wichowsky.

18:22.901 --> 18:23.993
She died a year ago

18:24.136 --> 18:26.366
of an overdose from
a mix of alcohol and heroin.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.234
Garcia, get us the address
of the foster home.

18:28.373 --> 18:29.635
Somebody there
might know something.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.538
Sure. Give me a sec.

18:47.726 --> 18:49.660
I talked to all four
of Ray's foster families.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.456
They say he was removed
from his parents' home

18:51.597 --> 18:53.030
because of drugs and abuse.

18:53.165 --> 18:54.894
- Garcia.
- <i>Yes?</i>

18:55.033 --> 18:56.796
Can we confirm that
with the biological family?

18:56.935 --> 18:59.130
Okay. I'm gonna patch you through.

19:23.595 --> 19:26.120
I want you to take the ninth step.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.095
Take the ninth step? Why?

19:31.236 --> 19:32.635
I didn't do anything.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.339
I was put into foster care
because of you,

19:37.476 --> 19:39.444
you bastard.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.546
You were put in foster care
because of a drug problem.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.011
Ray, no one molested you.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.680
Put the gun down, Ray.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.520
Shut up!

19:55.661 --> 19:58.994
Take the ninth step,
or I'm gonna shoot you, Dad.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.292
I didn't do it.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.924
I didn't touch you.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.074
Ray...

20:17.216 --> 20:19.207
you're my own flesh and blood.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.148
I never touched you.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.117
- Don't you lie!
- Syd, I'll take care of it.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.590
I swear it!

20:29.494 --> 20:30.927
Take the ninth step.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.630
I ain't taking no step.

20:33.765 --> 20:35.232
Take it.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.232
Take it.

20:37.369 --> 20:38.859
I ain't gonna ask you again.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.081
No!

21:04.796 --> 21:06.354
Why did you do that, Syd?

21:06.498 --> 21:07.965
'Cause you wouldn't.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.000
I would have. Look what you did.

21:10.135 --> 21:11.466
Come on, Ray.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.935
- Look what you did, Syd!
- Come on, Ray.

21:14.072 --> 21:15.471
Look what you did!

21:15.607 --> 21:17.302
It wasn't for you to do!

21:17.442 --> 21:18.875
This was mine, Syd!

21:28.420 --> 21:32.413
All right, so Ray must
have been sitting right here,

21:32.557 --> 21:34.752
playing Russian Roulette with his dad.

21:34.893 --> 21:37.293
Mr. Donovan was shot
from across the room.

21:37.429 --> 21:38.862
Ray couldn't have done it sitting there.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.426
Maybe he got mad,

21:42.567 --> 21:44.364
went over by the door,
shot him from there.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.464
Prentiss.

21:51.376 --> 21:52.308
You all right?

21:52.444 --> 21:54.036
Yeah. It's nothing.

21:54.179 --> 21:56.579
Uh, what if Ray didn't do it at all?

21:56.715 --> 21:58.808
What if the girl pulled the trigger?

21:58.950 --> 22:01.145
Why would Ray let her do that?
He was the one with the grudge.

22:01.286 --> 22:05.313
Ray kept asking Paul
to take the ninth step.

22:07.025 --> 22:08.652
"Take the ninth step."

22:09.661 --> 22:12.095
It sounds like they're making amends,
but they're twisting it,

22:12.230 --> 22:13.697
trying to force people
who have wronged them

22:13.832 --> 22:14.799
to make amends to them.

22:14.933 --> 22:18.232
Mrs. Donovan, did you hear
the name of the girl that Ray's with?

22:21.707 --> 22:23.538
He kept calling her Syd.

22:24.710 --> 22:25.836
Syd, I think.

22:25.977 --> 22:28.104
Maybe she's the one calling the shots.

22:28.246 --> 22:29.406
She's the psychopath.

22:29.548 --> 22:31.948
Well, if she did do it without his consent,
they're going to be at odds.

22:32.084 --> 22:35.315
The first marital fight
is supposed to be the worst.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.888
Well, it just might be
the wedge that we need.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.225
Ray...

22:41.360 --> 22:43.453
please don't be mad.

22:43.595 --> 22:45.563
- Baby. Baby!
- I just need a minute.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.631
Let me talk to you.
I'm going to tell you I'm sorry.

22:47.766 --> 22:48.790
Huh?

22:48.934 --> 22:50.993
He touched me, not you.

22:51.136 --> 22:53.104
Baby, just hit me.

22:53.238 --> 22:55.103
Come on. Just take your
frustrations out on me.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.867
Come on. Come on, baby.
Hit me. Hit me.

22:57.008 --> 22:58.202
- Stop it, Syd!
- Hit me.

22:58.343 --> 22:59.571
Stop it, Syd!

23:00.879 --> 23:02.710
Yeah. Yeah.

23:02.848 --> 23:05.146
Do it. Do it.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.617
When I say I'm gonna handle something,
I will handle it.

23:09.755 --> 23:12.451
- I understand, baby.
- I am the man in this relationship.

23:12.591 --> 23:15.025
I just want to make you
feel better, baby.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.957
Syd, a man takes care of things.

23:18.263 --> 23:19.924
- You understand me?
- Oh, I understand.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.056
- Huh?
- I understand.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.565
I understand.

23:23.702 --> 23:24.794
Mmm.

23:24.936 --> 23:26.096
I'm serious, Syd.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.365
I am, too. Mmm.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.176
Yeah, baby.

23:44.222 --> 23:47.623
Okay, so no Ray Donovan filed
for a marriage certificate.

23:47.759 --> 23:48.987
However, I looked at that list again,

23:49.127 --> 23:51.322
and there's a Sydney Manning
of Washington State

23:51.463 --> 23:52.760
who filed for a marriage certificate

23:52.898 --> 23:54.297
<i>two days ago in Montana.</i>

23:54.433 --> 23:56.298
Washington State?
We profiled North Dakota.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.733
<i>She's lived in North Dakota</i>
<i>for the last four years,</i>

23:58.870 --> 23:59.802
<i>And it gets better...</i>

23:59.938 --> 24:01.132
or worse, rather.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.503
It turns out that Sydney
was sentenced to mandatory rehab

24:03.642 --> 24:05.576
after serving time for a hit and run

24:05.710 --> 24:07.974
during which she was
under the influence

24:08.113 --> 24:09.478
<i>of alcohol and heroin.</i>

24:09.614 --> 24:12.447
Oh, wait. So she didn't volunteer
for alcohol support.

24:12.584 --> 24:14.643
Nope. She was placed there
as part of her parole.

24:14.786 --> 24:15.878
Alcohol and heroin.

24:16.021 --> 24:18.148
Isn't that the same combo
that Ray's ex OD'd on?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.314
Yes, it is, my friend.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.585
So both Syd and the ex
have the same vice.

24:21.726 --> 24:22.852
Garcia, check to see if there's

24:22.994 --> 24:24.723
any juvie records
of the ex we can access.

24:24.863 --> 24:26.558
Amy was pulled out of high school

24:26.698 --> 24:28.461
so she could go to rehab
for alcohol dependency.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.965
But no mention of the heroin?

24:30.101 --> 24:31.796
What are you thinking?

24:31.937 --> 24:33.461
Psychopaths will destroy
anything in their path.

24:33.605 --> 24:35.004
What if Amy was in Sydney's way?

24:35.140 --> 24:37.438
Garcia, where is Sydney Manning's
biological family?

24:37.576 --> 24:38.804
Spokane, Washington.

24:38.944 --> 24:40.434
And why was she
pulled out of her home?

24:40.579 --> 24:42.069
Her father was molesting her.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.408
So Ray and Syd did meet

24:43.548 --> 24:45.413
after sharing similar backgrounds
in alcohol support.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.347
And if they're sticking to the pattern
of making amends,

24:47.486 --> 24:49.078
Sydney's father's next on the list.

24:49.221 --> 24:51.212
Reid, you stay at the command center
in case they double back.

24:51.356 --> 24:52.721
The rest of us
are gonna go to Spokane.

25:12.644 --> 25:15.010
# <i>I want to take you back there</i> #

25:15.146 --> 25:16.613
# <i>Can I take you back?</i> #

25:16.748 --> 25:21.185
# <i>Follow me</i> #

25:21.319 --> 25:23.344
# <i>Are you ready?</i> #

25:25.056 --> 25:29.584
# <i>Smoke-filled rooms with an amber glow</i> #

25:29.728 --> 25:30.990
# <i>Whispers in your ear...</i> #

25:31.129 --> 25:32.596
This is about to get crazy.

25:32.731 --> 25:34.460
<i>#...movin' slow</i> #

25:34.599 --> 25:39.195
# <i>Shadows dance all across the wall</i> #

25:39.337 --> 25:43.239
# <i>Reflections are the revival</i> #

25:45.143 --> 25:49.011
# <i>Mmm, mmm</i> #

25:49.147 --> 25:50.478
Can I help you?

25:50.615 --> 25:53.345
# <i>Yeah</i> #

25:53.485 --> 25:58.548
# <i>You can't stop when</i>
<i>the music's on your mind</i> #

25:58.690 --> 26:02.751
# <i>Feel so alive</i> #

26:02.894 --> 26:04.293
Hey, Daddy.

26:09.367 --> 26:11.335
How you been?

26:11.469 --> 26:12.936
What are you doing here, Sydney?

26:17.375 --> 26:21.175
Have you heard of the ninth step?

26:21.313 --> 26:25.010
# <i>Follow me</i> #

26:25.150 --> 26:26.640
- # <i>Are you ready</i> #
- What?

26:27.652 --> 26:29.677
I got no idea what you're talking about.

26:29.821 --> 26:31.413
Making amends.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.583
Why don't you just put the gun away?

26:34.726 --> 26:37.593
See, I don't want to put the gun away.

26:43.168 --> 26:45.432
I want you...

26:45.570 --> 26:46.696
to touch me.

27:10.428 --> 27:12.419
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

27:12.564 --> 27:17.001
 <i>I want you to touch me.</i>

27:23.141 --> 27:25.336
You used to like it.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.138
Syd, put your skirt down.

27:27.278 --> 27:30.076
I ain't puttin' down Jack.

27:30.215 --> 27:31.512
Sydney...

27:31.650 --> 27:34.084
What's the matter, Daddy?

27:34.219 --> 27:36.210
You don't like the way I look?

27:42.761 --> 27:44.126
Sydney...

27:45.130 --> 27:46.461
you're out of control.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.862
No, no, no.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.197
You were out of control.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.771
Listen...

27:58.910 --> 28:00.605
I'm sorry.

28:00.745 --> 28:04.010
I'm sorry I hurt you.

28:04.149 --> 28:06.310
But I've changed.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.214
I've found God.

28:12.323 --> 28:13.688
God?

28:13.825 --> 28:16.953
Where was He every time you'd take me
to that back room, huh?

28:18.329 --> 28:19.318
I don't know.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.724
- Not here.
- I don't know.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.528
Not here.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.733
Every time I'd hear that door chime...

28:30.275 --> 28:32.209
Somebody's gonna come save me?

28:35.447 --> 28:36.709
It never happened.

28:38.516 --> 28:41.679
God was nowhere near this place.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.185
Please.

28:44.789 --> 28:45.721
Sydney...

28:45.857 --> 28:49.020
What do you want me to do?

28:49.160 --> 28:51.060
There's nothing you can do,

28:51.196 --> 28:54.256
you sorry piece of trash!

28:54.399 --> 28:55.423
Yeah, baby.

29:04.609 --> 29:06.270
Daddy? Daddy!

29:06.411 --> 29:08.174
What are you doing to my dad?

29:21.426 --> 29:22.552
May I help you?

29:22.694 --> 29:24.286
Mrs. Manning, we're with the FBI.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.056
- Is your husband home?
- He's at work.

29:26.197 --> 29:27.721
What is this about?

29:27.866 --> 29:30.266
Your daughter Sydney...
We think she's planning on hurting him.

29:30.401 --> 29:32.528
Sydney? That's Gary's kid.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.297
He hasn't seen her in years.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.771
Can you tell us your husband's
work address, please?

29:36.908 --> 29:39.968
Uh, 785 Halbrook Street,
off Kirkland Road.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.874
He owns a gas station.

29:43.214 --> 29:44.408
Thank you.

29:44.549 --> 29:46.312
- Daddy!
- Please, Sydney, don't do this.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.941
I never hurt her
I never hurt her!

29:48.086 --> 29:49.815
Of course you didn't!

29:49.954 --> 29:52.718
He didn't, I swear. Daddy!

29:52.857 --> 29:54.484
Hey. Hey.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.218
Daddies don't do this
to their daughters.

29:58.029 --> 29:59.519
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

29:59.664 --> 30:01.131
We're gonna get you out of here.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.860
Hey. Hey, honey.

30:04.002 --> 30:05.833
You'll change your mind.

30:05.970 --> 30:07.961
I did.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.778
I want my daddy! My daddy!

30:20.251 --> 30:23.118
Prentiss, get down! It's them! Get back!

30:26.658 --> 30:28.523
Syd!

30:28.660 --> 30:30.423
Syd!

30:39.604 --> 30:40.696
Ray!

30:40.839 --> 30:43.239
Syd! Syd!

30:46.678 --> 30:49.203
Syd! Syd!

30:51.182 --> 30:53.412
Syd! Syd... Syd!

31:00.491 --> 31:01.423
Shh. Hey.

31:01.559 --> 31:04.858
Ray, they got me. They got me, baby.

31:04.996 --> 31:06.725
You're gonna be okay.
It's not that bad, baby.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.333
She needs a doctor.

31:09.467 --> 31:12.095
- I know what she needs.
- Get me some whiskey.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.797
- There's no alcohol in here.
- You're kidding me.

31:14.939 --> 31:17.772
My dad doesn't drink.
He said it's against the Bible.

31:17.909 --> 31:19.604
You don't have to protect him anymore.

31:19.744 --> 31:21.211
He's gone.

31:21.346 --> 31:22.506
Get her a water.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.813
Get her some water!

31:29.954 --> 31:31.182
What do you want?

31:31.322 --> 31:34.951
Mr. Donovan,
how you doing in there?

31:35.093 --> 31:36.890
How do you think I'm doing?
You shot my girl.

31:37.028 --> 31:39.496
No, it was one of my agents.
He didn't have a choice.

31:39.631 --> 31:42.065
He had a choice. He could've shot me.
Now put him on the phone.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.326
<i>I can't do that.</i>

31:43.468 --> 31:46.096
Yes, you can. Put him on the phone.
He needs to fix this crap.

31:47.171 --> 31:48.195
Morgan.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.235
<i>Hello, Ray.</i>

31:51.376 --> 31:54.209
You know, if you come out,
we can get Sydney to the hospital.

31:54.345 --> 31:55.642
She doesn't need a hospital.

31:55.780 --> 31:56.974
She's strong.

31:57.115 --> 31:58.446
<i>Don't be stupid.</i>

31:58.583 --> 31:59.880
You don't be stupid.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.418
Now get your men out of here
so we can continue on as planned.

32:02.553 --> 32:04.020
<i>We can't do that, Ray, and you know it.</i>

32:04.155 --> 32:05.417
You got a little girl inside.

32:05.556 --> 32:07.581
And God only knows
what happened to Sydney's father.

32:07.725 --> 32:09.454
Justice happened to her father.

32:09.594 --> 32:10.526
<i>So he's dead?</i>

32:10.662 --> 32:12.152
Damn right he's dead,
and his kid's gonna be, too,

32:12.297 --> 32:14.322
if you don't get me a car
to take us to Aruba.

32:14.465 --> 32:17.229
<i>All right. Let me see</i>
<i>what I can do about that.</i>

32:17.368 --> 32:19.336
Is there anything else
you need in the meantime?

32:19.470 --> 32:20.402
<i>Some gauze</i>

32:20.538 --> 32:22.369
and some booze.

32:22.507 --> 32:25.943
And not no cheap kind, either.

32:26.077 --> 32:28.773
It has now been two hours since
Ray Donovan and Sydney Manning

32:28.913 --> 32:31.381
locked themselves inside
this Spokane gas station.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.814
Two hostages are thought to be inside,

32:33.952 --> 32:35.920
the owner of the station
and his 10-year-old daughter.

32:36.054 --> 32:37.419
What do they want?

32:37.555 --> 32:39.489
Liquor and tickets to Aruba.

32:39.624 --> 32:40.591
They're delusional.

32:40.725 --> 32:41.919
You're not negotiating with them?

32:42.060 --> 32:43.527
No, but we're gonna
let them think we are.

32:46.864 --> 32:49.025
Does she look like me?

32:50.868 --> 32:53.598
I think she does.

32:53.738 --> 32:56.104
I don't know, Syd.

32:58.376 --> 33:00.708
Don't be scared.
We're not gonna hurt you.

33:03.014 --> 33:05.448
- Syd...
- What grade are you in?

33:05.583 --> 33:07.210
Shh, Syd.

33:07.352 --> 33:08.842
You need to preserve your energy.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.421
Fourth grade.

33:11.556 --> 33:14.081
I liked the fourth grade.

33:14.225 --> 33:15.658
Stop talking to her.

33:18.262 --> 33:19.422
Relax, Ray.

33:19.564 --> 33:23.056
We're having a family reunion
in aisle 3.

33:23.201 --> 33:24.998
Be supportive.

33:30.808 --> 33:31.740
Move back!

33:31.876 --> 33:34.811
Baby, sit right here.
Move back or I kill this girl!

33:34.946 --> 33:37.938
Back up! Back up!

33:38.082 --> 33:40.175
I will shoot this kid!

33:40.318 --> 33:42.218
Back up!

33:43.688 --> 33:44.780
Back!

33:48.893 --> 33:50.827
Kid, unlock that door. You got it?

33:50.962 --> 33:53.328
- Uh-huh.
- Put your hand out and unlock it.

33:53.464 --> 33:54.829
Just unlock it.

33:54.966 --> 33:56.058
- Got it?
- Yes.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.667
- Okay.
- Yes.

34:01.472 --> 34:03.099
Ray? Take it easy, man.

34:03.241 --> 34:04.367
Uh-huh.

34:04.509 --> 34:06.170
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy.

34:06.310 --> 34:07.709
- Put it down!
- All right.

34:07.845 --> 34:10.074
Put it down.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.205
I got you the stuff you asked for.
We're working on the rest.

34:12.350 --> 34:13.373
Great.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.315
If you need anything else,
you just pick up that phone.

34:15.453 --> 34:16.715
It's routed straight to us.
You understand?

34:16.853 --> 34:18.685
I should kill you right now.

34:18.822 --> 34:20.120
- Back up.
- I'm leaving.

34:20.257 --> 34:21.623
Back up!

34:21.759 --> 34:23.784
Now lock the door.

34:23.928 --> 34:25.020
- You got it?
- Uh-huh.

34:25.163 --> 34:26.357
Let's go.

34:26.496 --> 34:28.362
Lock it.

34:28.498 --> 34:30.797
Stay here. Don't move.

34:30.935 --> 34:33.027
Don't move.

34:34.705 --> 34:35.967
Okay.

34:37.675 --> 34:40.906
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.
- Okay. Shh.

34:41.045 --> 34:43.172
Did they say anything about the car?

34:43.313 --> 34:44.303
Mmm. Oh...

34:44.449 --> 34:45.677
Shh, baby.

34:45.817 --> 34:48.217
Poor baby. Let me see.

34:48.351 --> 34:49.944
Ohh! Oh!

34:59.497 --> 35:01.431
- Yeah?
- Where the hell is our car?

35:01.566 --> 35:03.500
I need you to listen
to me for a second.

35:03.634 --> 35:04.896
I know you've had a hard time,

35:05.036 --> 35:06.697
with your father and everything
that he did to you.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.635
Shut up.
You don't know anything about me.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.071
Last year, your ex-girlfriend Amy
was murdered. I know that.

35:13.244 --> 35:14.711
Amy committed suicide.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.371
<i>No, she was killed, Ray.</i>

35:17.515 --> 35:18.914
Nah.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.041
Amy OD'd on PCP and alcohol.

35:21.185 --> 35:23.176
They found heroin in her system, Ray.

35:23.321 --> 35:26.290
Amy never did heroin.

35:26.424 --> 35:28.722
<i>Exactly.</i> 
<i>Because somebody gave it to her.</i>

35:28.860 --> 35:30.521
<i>Why don't you ask Sydney about it?</i>

35:30.661 --> 35:31.855
Why? What does she...

35:31.996 --> 35:33.657
What does she have to do with this?

35:33.798 --> 35:34.856
Ray, what's going on?

35:34.999 --> 35:36.591
<i>Come on, man, think for a second.</i>

35:36.734 --> 35:39.635
<i>Sydney joined alcohol support</i>
<i>right after you and Amy broke up.</i>

35:39.770 --> 35:41.499
She could see you still
had feelings for Amy,

35:41.639 --> 35:43.129
<i>so Sydney needed Amy out of the way.</i>

35:43.274 --> 35:44.536
You're out of line, pal.

35:44.675 --> 35:45.607
<i>Then ask her.</i>

35:45.743 --> 35:46.869
<i>But I guarantee when you do,</i>

35:47.011 --> 35:47.943
she's not gonna answer you.

35:48.079 --> 35:49.808
She's only gonna question
you back, Ray.

35:49.947 --> 35:51.209
What are you talking about?

35:51.349 --> 35:53.544
<i>Sydney is the one</i>
<i>who gave Amy that heroin.</i>

35:53.684 --> 35:55.151
<i>Ask her.</i>

35:55.286 --> 35:56.583
Hey, what...

35:56.721 --> 35:58.052
what's wrong, Ray?

35:58.189 --> 36:00.020
<i>Ask her. Get her to come clean.</i>

36:03.661 --> 36:06.152
Did you give Amy heroin?

36:06.297 --> 36:08.788
Baby, what are you talking about?
I love you.

36:10.301 --> 36:11.598
Listen...

36:11.736 --> 36:14.170
<i>You see that, Ray?</i> 
<i>We call that structural deception.</i>

36:14.305 --> 36:15.431
She doesn't want
to answer your question.

36:15.573 --> 36:16.972
She's only buying herself some time

36:17.108 --> 36:18.769
so she can think of something else
to say to you.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.207
That's not true.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.902
<i>Ray, Sydney killed Amy.</i>

36:22.046 --> 36:23.035
<i>And if you press her,</i>

36:23.181 --> 36:24.808
<i>she's probably gonna try</i>
<i>and use sexual distraction</i>

36:24.949 --> 36:26.177
<i>to get you to change the subject.</i>

36:26.317 --> 36:27.784
Don't you talk about my wife like that.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.409
What is... What is he saying?

36:29.554 --> 36:31.818
<i>Sexual distraction, Ray.</i> 
<i>You gotta listen to me.</i>

36:31.956 --> 36:33.321
No, I'm done listening to you.

36:33.457 --> 36:35.288
Now, why don't you get us a car
and some plane tickets,

36:35.426 --> 36:37.087
or I am gonna blow
this girl's head off.

36:38.296 --> 36:39.763
It's okay. It's okay, sis.

36:39.897 --> 36:42.127
It's okay.

36:42.266 --> 36:43.290
Baby, Ray...

36:43.434 --> 36:44.833
- Why is he telling me that?
- I don't know.

36:44.969 --> 36:46.129
Why is he saying this to me?
- I don't know.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.534
I don't know. I don't know.

36:50.174 --> 36:51.573
You wouldn't do that to Amy,
would you?

36:51.709 --> 36:53.904
Of course not, baby.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.637
Hey.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.304
Hey, you know what we should do

36:57.448 --> 37:00.042
while we're waiting
to get out of here?

37:00.184 --> 37:02.652
We should make love
right here in front of them.

37:02.787 --> 37:05.517
Yeah, that would really
freak them out, wouldn't it?

37:05.656 --> 37:07.487
Yeah?

37:09.427 --> 37:12.419
Baby, make love to me...

37:12.563 --> 37:14.690
right here in front of them.

37:14.832 --> 37:16.356
Yeah.

37:21.606 --> 37:23.267
I think we got through to him.

37:23.407 --> 37:24.874
This thing's gonna end.

37:25.009 --> 37:26.169
He's gonna ask her again.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.902
He has to.

37:28.045 --> 37:30.013
The kid's our only priority.

37:32.316 --> 37:34.944
Go back by the door.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.417
I said go to the door!

37:38.956 --> 37:41.789
Baby, we can do it...

37:41.926 --> 37:43.723
while everybody's watching us.

37:45.162 --> 37:48.256
Ray, that's so hot. It's so hot, Ray.

37:48.399 --> 37:49.889
You know, the first time I saw you,

37:50.034 --> 37:51.763
I knew I had to have you.

37:51.902 --> 37:54.370
You were the yin to my yang, Ray.

37:54.505 --> 37:56.200
Till death do us part, right?

37:56.340 --> 37:58.638
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right?

37:58.776 --> 38:01.142
Till death do us part.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.713
Oh, baby.

38:46.857 --> 38:48.484
Syd.

38:57.301 --> 38:59.132
Oh. Oh.

38:59.270 --> 39:00.737
Syd. Oh.

39:03.874 --> 39:06.365
What's happening in there?

39:06.510 --> 39:09.377
Ray's pacing.

39:09.513 --> 39:11.413
That is not good.

39:14.218 --> 39:16.049
What did you do to her?

39:17.855 --> 39:20.790
Syd? Syd! Please, Syd.

39:20.925 --> 39:22.392
Wake up, Syd.

39:22.526 --> 39:23.788
Baby, wake up. Come on.

39:23.928 --> 39:25.759
Syd, please wake up.

39:25.896 --> 39:27.625
Please.

39:27.765 --> 39:29.096
Please.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.968
Please, Syd.

39:58.028 --> 39:59.893
Enough's enough, baby.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.326
I see the girl.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.130
Where's Sydney and Ray?

40:10.274 --> 40:11.764
Morgan, go.

40:18.516 --> 40:20.074
No!

40:45.709 --> 40:46.767
Syd!

41:15.139 --> 41:16.436

Emily Prentiss.

41:32.289 --> 41:34.348
- Sean, how are you?
- Good.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.727
So I was gonna call you back.

41:38.863 --> 41:40.854
I just got busy on a case.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.489
I had to be in D.C. Anyway.

41:46.804 --> 41:49.170
Lan Doyle vanished from prison.

41:54.879 --> 41:56.141
Interpol can't find him.

41:56.280 --> 41:59.078
What... What are you saying?

42:00.751 --> 42:02.981
He's off the grid, Emily.

42:09.326 --> 42:10.987
Do you think he's headed here?

42:21.505 --> 42:22.767
Am I in danger?

42:27.378 --> 42:28.606
We all are.
