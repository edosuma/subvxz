He’s only three doors away
and he’s got

01:29.512 --> 01:30.915
the letters that
we’ve been waiting for!

’Oh, hey, hey! Oh.’

01:35.591 --> 01:37.896
What’s Balki so excited about?

01:37.929 --> 01:41.468
Is it some, uh,
Myposian holiday?

01:41.503 --> 01:43.306
Did Mud Day sneak
up on us again?

01:45.443 --> 01:46.947
Mud Day is not until next week

01:46.980 --> 01:49.384

I’d be getting my hats ready!

01:53.894 --> 01:55.765
Why, look at this, Mary Anne.

01:55.798 --> 01:58.971
You and I got a letter from
"The Baby Quiz" television show.

‐Oh!
‐And...

02:00.273 --> 02:03.748
Look, Jennifer and Cousin Larry
got a letter from them, too.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.454
What a completely
unplanned coincidence!

02:11.027 --> 02:13.633
Well, what would some stupid
game show want with us?

02:13.668 --> 02:16.606
Well, how would we know?
Why are you staring at us?

02:16.640 --> 02:18.442
Why are you boring holes
through us

Do we have a clue?

‐Clueless! Clueless!
‐Clueless! Absolutely clueless!

Well, the address says "Jennifer
and Cousin Larry Appleton."

02:43.492 --> 02:47.034
Well, I guess you caught
us with our pants on.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.842
Um, when Mary Anne and I found
out that "The Baby Quiz" show

02:50.875 --> 02:52.511
was looking for new contestants

02:52.545 --> 02:55.551
we thought it would be
wild, wacky, whimsical fun

02:55.584 --> 02:57.789
for both families to be on
at the same time.

02:57.822 --> 03:02.464
So, after filling out 800
of our own applications...

03:05.604 --> 03:07.709
...we quickly scribbled
out one for you.

03:07.742 --> 03:09.913
Open yours first.
The suspense is killing me!

03:16.458 --> 03:17.996
‐We were accepted!
‐Hot doggy!

03:18.029 --> 03:19.565
Now we all can be on together!

03:22.538 --> 03:23.540
No, we won’t.

03:24.241 --> 03:26.145
We were rejected.

03:26.178 --> 03:27.982
Oh, Balki!

03:28.016 --> 03:29.953
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

03:29.986 --> 03:33.126
Now there, there, my little
cement mixer. Don’t be sad.

03:34.796 --> 03:36.533
Now, listen.

03:36.566 --> 03:39.672
Just because we filled out
Cousin Larry and Jennifer’s

03:39.705 --> 03:43.479
winning application and, and
had 800 of our own rejected

03:43.513 --> 03:45.684
that’s no reason
to be upset.

03:45.717 --> 03:47.989
Right?

03:48.022 --> 03:50.527
We are very...

04:05.290 --> 04:07.829
Well, thank you, Balki,
but, uh

04:07.862 --> 04:11.002
I‐I don’t think we’ll be going
on "The Baby Quiz" show.

04:11.937 --> 04:13.707
I am not about to let my wife

04:13.740 --> 04:16.980
and unborn child be exploited
just so that we can win

04:17.014 --> 04:19.284
a year’s supply of baby wipes.

04:21.122 --> 04:22.558
Larry, I think it would be fun.

04:23.159 --> 04:24.595
No! No, no!

04:24.629 --> 04:26.900
My mind is absolutely made up.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.637
Balki, why, why don’t
you take this letter

04:28.670 --> 04:30.140
and try to go on in our place?

04:34.749 --> 04:35.785
Cousin...

04:36.252 --> 04:38.122
I am so touched.

04:38.156 --> 04:41.062
It is so generous of you
to give up your chance

04:41.095 --> 04:43.633
to win your child
a college scholarship.

04:43.667 --> 04:44.669
College scholarship?

04:46.005 --> 04:47.976
To the school of your choice.

04:48.009 --> 04:50.046
Well, you know, it does
have our name on it

04:50.080 --> 04:51.282
and we don’t want to, uh

04:51.315 --> 04:54.054
deceive those nice
game show people.

04:54.088 --> 04:56.894
So I guess, uh, we will be
going on "The Baby Quiz" show.

05:02.137 --> 05:05.343
I don’t want to do this.
Why do we have to do this?

05:05.376 --> 05:07.380
Come on, Larry.
It’ll make ’em happy,

and hasn’t seen
her feet since February!

’Thank you, Tyanna.’

"The Baby Quiz" works.

about your pregnancy

in our soundproof booth.

Later on, we’ll reunite you

06:27.474 --> 06:29.512

your answers compare.

wins. Isn’t that something?

07:26.092 --> 07:27.895
I love the crazy little
flip in your hair.

07:28.730 --> 07:30.433
You and I had chatted backstage

07:30.466 --> 07:32.204
and you’d mentioned that,
uh, this has been

07:32.237 --> 07:34.241
a particularly difficult
pregnancy for you.

07:34.274 --> 07:35.276
Is that right?

07:35.310 --> 07:37.280
And that you’ve been
under a lot of stress

07:37.314 --> 07:40.020
and you’ve developed kind
of a quirky little nervous tick.

07:40.053 --> 07:41.422
Is that right?

07:41.455 --> 07:42.424
Come on, let’s see it.

07:42.457 --> 07:44.428
’Let’s see your little
nervous tick.’

07:44.461 --> 07:46.265
’There it is and it’s adorable!’

07:46.298 --> 07:48.570
Well, you’ll be happy
to know the first question

07:48.603 --> 07:52.444
has nothing to do with your
crazy, quirky little tick.

07:52.477 --> 07:56.318
Jennifer...since
you’ve been pregnant

07:56.352 --> 07:58.557
which part of your
body hurts the most?

07:58.590 --> 08:02.064
Is it your upper half...
or your lower half?

08:03.466 --> 08:05.771
It’s my lower half.
I get terrible leg cramps.

08:05.804 --> 08:08.743
Alright, let’s bring back
Cousin Larry Appleton

08:08.777 --> 08:11.448
and see how well he knows
the mother of his child.

08:11.482 --> 08:12.718
[laughs]

08:12.751 --> 08:14.689
Alright!

08:14.722 --> 08:17.160
Alright, Cousin Larry Appleton,
it’s good to have you back.

08:17.194 --> 08:18.630
Your wife is lovely.

08:18.663 --> 08:21.135
And you and I were chatting
backstage earlier.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.573
And you mentioned to me that
one of your greatest fears...

08:23.607 --> 08:25.611
...is that your unborn
child might inherit

08:25.644 --> 08:28.517
your short, stubby legs
and your hammer toes.

08:31.322 --> 08:35.096
Your hammer toes. Father
had them, they’re no fun.

08:35.130 --> 08:36.599
’You’ll be happy to know...’

08:36.633 --> 08:39.672
’...your first question...’

08:39.705 --> 08:40.774
[laughs]

08:40.807 --> 08:41.808
Alright!

08:43.246 --> 08:45.216
Your first question,
we asked Jennifer

08:45.250 --> 08:46.753
"Jennifer, since
you’ve been pregnant

08:46.786 --> 08:48.823
"which part of your
body hurts the most?

08:48.857 --> 08:51.829
Is it your upper half
or your lower half?"

08:52.665 --> 08:53.633
Easy question.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.405
She has constant headaches
and a stiff neck.

08:56.438 --> 08:57.474
Definitely upper half.

08:57.508 --> 08:59.845
Ooh! I’m sorry!

08:59.879 --> 09:02.284
No, she said that
she had leg cramps.

09:02.317 --> 09:03.720
That’d be lower half.

09:05.691 --> 09:08.830
Larry, I get leg
cramps every night.

09:08.863 --> 09:11.402
Where have you been
the last 32 weeks?

09:11.435 --> 09:13.206
Do we know each other?
Have we met?

09:13.239 --> 09:14.842
Hey, th‐that’s just
the first question.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.579
Th‐the next question’s probably
going to be something about

09:16.613 --> 09:18.717
food cravings and‐and
I happen to know

09:18.750 --> 09:20.486
you have a thing
for ice cream.

09:20.521 --> 09:22.190
‐Pop tarts.
‐Pop tarts, I knew that.

09:23.426 --> 09:26.365
[upbeat music]

09:35.216 --> 09:36.886
Larry, this is making
me nervous.

09:36.919 --> 09:38.923
We played this game with Balki
for two hours yesterday

09:38.957 --> 09:41.195
and didn’t get
a single answer right.

09:41.228 --> 09:43.466
We’re gonna make fools
of ourselves on television.

09:43.499 --> 09:47.340
We are not going to make fools
of ourselves on television.

09:47.374 --> 09:48.877
Look, if we just answer
the questions

09:48.910 --> 09:50.380
the way we practiced
this morning

09:50.413 --> 09:51.683
everything will be fine.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.987
What if they don’t
ask those questions?

09:54.020 --> 09:56.258
I have a hunch they will.

09:57.695 --> 10:00.500
Hey, hey, hey!
Here’s my lucky contestants!

10:00.534 --> 10:02.304
How are you? Ha, ha, ha.

10:02.337 --> 10:04.274
Oh‐oh! Who’s got a bun
in the oven, huh?

10:04.308 --> 10:05.944
[laughs]

10:05.977 --> 10:06.979
Alright.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.486
I‐I‐I guess that would be us.

10:10.521 --> 10:12.257
Uh, Larry and Jennifer Appleton.

10:12.290 --> 10:14.494
Well, nice to meet you,
Appletons.

10:14.529 --> 10:15.997
[laughs]

10:17.500 --> 10:18.737
Mary Anne, it’s‐it’s him!

10:18.770 --> 10:20.641
It’s Lance Edwards!

10:20.674 --> 10:23.045
And you must be my other
lucky contestants.

10:23.078 --> 10:27.655
No. We applied, but we were
unfortunately overlooked.

10:27.688 --> 10:28.990
Eight hundred times.

10:30.527 --> 10:32.798
But we have front row tickets!

10:32.831 --> 10:35.571
Lance, I’m sorry. I just cannot
keep it to myself any longer.

10:35.604 --> 10:37.608
You are my favorite
game show host!

10:42.818 --> 10:43.987
Uh, Lance,
we have a problem.

10:44.020 --> 10:45.256
Yeah, don’t worry,
I can handle him.

10:45.290 --> 10:48.462
No, no, uh, the other game show
contestants went into labor.

10:48.496 --> 10:49.565
They’re on their way
to the hospital.

10:51.769 --> 10:53.873
Ooh, well, that’s too bad.

10:53.907 --> 10:56.345
I guess that means,
uh, we win by default.

10:56.378 --> 10:58.349
Uh no, no. Actually,
that happens all the time.

10:58.382 --> 11:01.355
We’ll just, uh, pick another
couple from our studio audience.

11:01.388 --> 11:03.527
‐Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
‐Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

11:03.560 --> 11:06.064
Alright. Here’s kind
of a kooky thought.

11:06.097 --> 11:07.768
How about you two?

11:07.801 --> 11:10.774
Oh, Lance!
That’s a dream come true!

11:10.807 --> 11:12.778
‐Lance, capture the moment.
‐Oh, sure.

11:15.115 --> 11:16.686
‐You got to advance it.
‐Oh, alright!

11:23.165 --> 11:25.837
[instrumental music]

11:27.541 --> 11:30.012
Alright, everybody!
It’s time to play...

11:30.045 --> 11:31.816
‐The Baby Quiz!
‐The Baby Quiz!

11:35.089 --> 11:38.061
So daddies, if you’ll follow
our hostess, the lovely Tyanna

11:38.095 --> 11:39.665
to our soundproof booth

11:39.699 --> 11:41.669
we’re going to ask your wives
a series of questions

11:41.703 --> 11:44.675
and then bring you back out
to see how your answers compare.

11:44.709 --> 11:46.879
[both laugh]

11:46.913 --> 11:47.981
‐Alright!
‐Alright!

11:50.987 --> 11:53.226
Alright. Jen, we’re prepared,
we’re gonna be great, right?

11:53.259 --> 11:54.461
Right.

11:54.929 --> 11:56.899
[upbeat music]

12:04.649 --> 12:06.853
Tyanna. I’ve always
wanted to meet you.

12:07.821 --> 12:09.190
I read your book.

12:09.223 --> 12:10.994
And I thought
your layman’s slant

12:11.027 --> 12:12.965
on the Middle East
was mesmerizing.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.106
I especially liked
that chapter called

12:17.139 --> 12:19.645
"There’s No Such Thing
as Too Much Moisturizer."

12:21.616 --> 12:23.185
You have no pores
in your skin, do you?

12:26.057 --> 12:27.294
Hey, cousin,
can you believe it?

12:27.327 --> 12:29.298
We got inside the booth!

12:29.331 --> 12:32.671
It’s kind of like
a big fish tank, isn’t it?

12:32.705 --> 12:35.075
Alright. Let’s begin
"The Baby Quiz."

12:38.650 --> 12:40.687
I hope they could get
a good shot of this

12:40.721 --> 12:42.156
on the special booth camera.

12:43.326 --> 12:44.962
Special booth camera?

12:44.995 --> 12:46.866
Yeah, it’s a special camera

12:46.899 --> 12:49.304
and they have it
focused on the booth.

12:49.338 --> 12:52.076
It’s called
"The Special Booth Camera."

12:53.813 --> 12:54.849
’Cause they love to get

12:54.882 --> 12:57.320
shots of the daddies making
fools of themselves.

13:05.135 --> 13:07.708
Well, they are not going
to get any shots of you

13:07.741 --> 13:09.645
or me making fools
of ourselves, alright?

13:09.679 --> 13:11.382
So let’s just,
let’s just, keep quiet.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.853
Why we have to keep quiet?
It’s a soundproof booth.

13:14.889 --> 13:15.957
Nobody can hear us.

13:17.159 --> 13:18.228
Let’s see if it works.

13:19.331 --> 13:20.232
Mary Anne!

13:20.265 --> 13:22.337
Ladies, how much weight
have you gained

13:22.370 --> 13:24.107
so far during your pregnancy?

13:24.140 --> 13:25.844
Cousin, it really does work!

13:25.877 --> 13:27.748
Well, I’ll be my uncle’s monkey!

13:27.781 --> 13:28.883
We can say anything you want!

13:29.418 --> 13:31.656
Mary Anne!

13:31.689 --> 13:32.758
Okay, alright, that’s enough.

13:32.791 --> 13:33.827
That’s enough, alright?

13:33.860 --> 13:35.997
Let’s just, let’s just
keep quiet now. Okay?

13:36.031 --> 13:39.103
Let’s just be quiet
and just behave ourselves.

13:42.344 --> 13:43.379
Whoa!

13:44.715 --> 13:46.051
Those lights are so bright

13:46.084 --> 13:48.088
they hurting my eyes.

13:48.121 --> 13:49.391
Studio lights
have to be bright...

13:49.424 --> 13:51.462
Yeah, but they’re so bright,
I can’t even look anywhere.

13:51.495 --> 13:52.598
Don’t stare into them.

13:52.631 --> 13:53.767
‐Don’t stare into them.
‐What am I gonna look at?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.370
‐Look at something else.
‐There’s nothing I can see.

13:55.403 --> 13:56.739
Just look at something else.

13:56.773 --> 13:57.708
I’m gonna look
at something else?

13:57.741 --> 13:59.110
Look at something
else, you’ll be fine.

13:59.143 --> 14:00.245
‐Alright.
‐Huh...

14:01.983 --> 14:03.486
Cousin, you know
what the problem is?

14:03.520 --> 14:06.157
Those lights draw me.

14:06.191 --> 14:08.161
They draw me.
They are penetrating.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.433
They fascinate me.
I cannot stop!

14:10.466 --> 14:12.437
I know they’re frying
my retinas.

14:12.470 --> 14:15.242
But I just cannot take my eyes
off them! I’m trying to be good.

14:15.275 --> 14:17.515
I’m trying to look where
you told me to look.

14:17.548 --> 14:20.486
But I cannot! I cannot!
Look at those lights!

14:22.256 --> 14:23.960
Alright. Alright.
Okay. Okay.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.531
Cousin, if I don’t
change places with you

14:25.564 --> 14:27.901
I’m gonna go
out of my mind!

14:27.935 --> 14:28.970
Alright, let’s switch places.

14:29.003 --> 14:30.541
‐Let’s just switch places.
‐Alright, alright.

14:30.574 --> 14:32.209
And just sit down and please

14:32.243 --> 14:35.149
just try not to embarrass me.

14:35.182 --> 14:39.559
Jennifer, what animal will your
husband say best describes you

14:39.592 --> 14:41.094
during your pregnancy?

14:41.127 --> 14:43.800
Animal describes you
during your pregnancy?

14:45.269 --> 14:46.839
Why hide behind
a question, Lance?

14:46.873 --> 14:48.977
Let’s face it,
I’m, I’m a whale.

14:49.010 --> 14:49.812
Ooh!

14:53.887 --> 14:54.755
What are you doing?

14:54.789 --> 14:56.257
Well, I’m trying
to get comfortable.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.462
This chair is like iron.

14:58.496 --> 15:00.232
You sat in this for all
that time and you...

15:00.265 --> 15:03.940
This is unbelievably
uncomfortable! It’s so hard!

15:03.973 --> 15:06.478
It’s like, what is this? Is this
some kind of torture instrument?

15:06.513 --> 15:08.583
And it looks just like
the chair I was just in.

15:08.617 --> 15:10.119
That’s the interesting bit.

15:10.152 --> 15:12.189
I mean... Any... With my...

15:12.223 --> 15:14.360
If I lean...

15:14.393 --> 15:15.864
Maybe if I just kind of lean...

15:15.897 --> 15:19.070
Could I put my head
partially on, on you, maybe?

15:20.039 --> 15:21.074
Alright, let’s switch places.

15:21.107 --> 15:22.511
No, I don’t want
to switch places.

15:22.545 --> 15:23.580
Let’s switch places.

15:23.613 --> 15:24.949
No, I don’t want
to switch places.

15:24.982 --> 15:26.151
I like my new place.

15:26.184 --> 15:28.321
Because when I sit over there,
the light’s in my eyes.

15:28.355 --> 15:29.223
‐Alright, fine.
‐I like my new place.

15:29.257 --> 15:31.261
I don’t have any problem
with where I am.

15:31.294 --> 15:32.898
‐Fine. Fine.
‐It’s the chair I want.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.539
I have to have that chair
in order to be comfortable

15:36.573 --> 15:39.645
because this chair is some kind
of iron maiden torture thing

15:39.679 --> 15:41.949
and I don’t like it.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.987
‐Impossible to get comfy.
‐No.

15:44.020 --> 15:45.089
‐Well, I want that chair.
‐No.

15:45.122 --> 15:46.391
‐Just give me the chair!
‐No.

15:46.424 --> 15:47.494
Cousin, I want that chair!

15:47.528 --> 15:49.430
I’m gonna go crazy
if I don’t get that chair!

15:49.464 --> 15:50.466
Now get out of it!

15:51.736 --> 15:54.307
Stop it! Stop it!
Put it back! Put it back!

15:54.340 --> 15:56.177
Stop it! Stop it!

15:56.211 --> 15:57.948
Listen to me!
Listen to me!

16:00.419 --> 16:03.627
Cousin Larry is not
switching chairs!

16:03.660 --> 16:05.631
Cousin Larry is not moving!

16:05.664 --> 16:09.037
In fact, Cousin Larry
is just going to sit here

16:09.070 --> 16:12.076
and pretend that he
doesn’t even know you!

16:14.582 --> 16:15.584
Cousin.

16:17.521 --> 16:18.657
I’m sorry, have we met?

16:20.661 --> 16:22.998
Now, we’re moving on to
the third trimester round

16:23.031 --> 16:26.104
where the points are doubled
and you can really fatten up...

16:26.137 --> 16:27.473
...your score, that is!

16:27.508 --> 16:30.345
[guffaws]

16:30.379 --> 16:31.314
Alright.

16:33.653 --> 16:34.622
Hey.

16:34.655 --> 16:37.093
You have writing
on the bottom of your shoe.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.095
Hmm?

16:38.128 --> 16:39.430
You have writing
on the bottom of your shoe.

16:39.463 --> 16:40.534
I know. No, I don’t.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.571
Yes, you do.
Let me see that shoe!

16:42.605 --> 16:45.777
Not this shoe. This one says,
"Little Man’s Footwear."

16:48.248 --> 16:49.585
Sure, of course there’s writing
on the bottom of my shoe.

16:49.619 --> 16:52.256
Because, because that’s, uh,
that’s, that’s, that’s, uh...

16:52.289 --> 16:54.562
That’s, that’s
my Christmas list.

16:54.595 --> 16:56.766
And, uh, and well, well
I can’t let you see it

16:56.799 --> 16:59.070
because I, I don’t want
to spoil the surprise.

16:59.103 --> 17:01.074
[chuckles]

17:02.209 --> 17:03.211
[chuckling continues]

17:08.255 --> 17:10.125
Ah‐ha!

17:10.159 --> 17:13.431
Jennifer’s favorite
food is pop tarts!

17:13.464 --> 17:15.368
So this is your
Christmas list, eh?

17:15.402 --> 17:18.441
’Okay, think now, if your
husband were a tree’

17:18.474 --> 17:21.181
’what kind of tree would he be?’

17:21.214 --> 17:23.218
‐This is no Christmas list!
‐Ow!

17:23.251 --> 17:24.622
These are the answers
to the game show!

17:24.655 --> 17:25.891
You’ve been cheating!

17:25.924 --> 17:27.527
‐Get up here!
‐Ow!

17:27.560 --> 17:30.601
You know what? Cheating
is a revolting practice.

17:34.207 --> 17:35.644
Balki, I couldn’t help it!

17:38.750 --> 17:40.252
‐There’s the camera! The cam...
‐Camera! The camera.

17:40.285 --> 17:41.789
[indistinct muttering]

17:41.823 --> 17:43.827
Don’t you see? I had no choice!

17:43.860 --> 17:45.697
When I couldn’t match answers
with Jennifer yesterday

17:45.731 --> 17:46.899
I panicked!

17:47.835 --> 17:49.739
So, so, I called "The Baby Quiz"

17:49.772 --> 17:51.241
and I told them I was doing
a story on the show

17:51.274 --> 17:54.180
and they sent me a 150
questions as research.

17:54.213 --> 17:57.788
And I only did it so I could
win a scholarship for my child.

17:57.821 --> 18:00.827
Cousin, I’m sorry, but
I cannot condone this cheating.

18:00.861 --> 18:02.129
I’m gonna tell Lance.
I’m gonna stop the game.

18:02.163 --> 18:04.902
‐Oh, you’re gonna tell Lance?
‐Yes, I’m gonna tell Lance.

18:04.935 --> 18:05.871
You’re gonna turn me in!

18:05.904 --> 18:08.743
I just hope you can live
with the consequences!

18:11.916 --> 18:13.687
What consequences?

18:13.720 --> 18:16.324
A child’s shattered dreams.

18:16.357 --> 18:18.697
A child’s pain,
his sorrow, his agony!

18:19.397 --> 18:21.267
Look, Balki! Look!

18:21.301 --> 18:22.738
On that, on that college campus

18:22.771 --> 18:26.946
you see happy students off to
their first day of class!

18:26.979 --> 18:28.917
Oh, but, but there’s
one little boy

18:28.950 --> 18:30.621
who, who just stands
and watches.

18:30.654 --> 18:32.389
It’s Larry Junior!

18:33.526 --> 18:35.596
And the other students
just point

18:35.631 --> 18:37.499
and laugh as they
go on their way.

18:37.534 --> 18:40.741
They’re, they’re playing
keep‐away with his dreams.

18:42.911 --> 18:44.447
And he wants to go to class.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.284
He wants to go but he can’t!

18:46.317 --> 18:48.923
He can’t because his Uncle Balki

18:48.957 --> 18:52.396
robbed him of his
college scholarship!

18:53.566 --> 18:54.802
Oh, look, Balki, look! Look!

18:54.835 --> 18:56.939
He’s, he’s,
he’s starting to cry.

18:56.973 --> 18:58.108
Look...

18:58.141 --> 19:02.851
His, his little tears dropping
into his empty notebook.

19:03.720 --> 19:04.989
Look.

19:05.022 --> 19:06.424
You see him, Balki?

19:07.393 --> 19:08.930
Do you see him

19:08.963 --> 19:10.767
crying out there?

19:10.801 --> 19:13.740
Oh, God! My boy.

19:16.011 --> 19:17.614
[sobbing]

19:17.647 --> 19:19.785
Help him, help him!

19:24.093 --> 19:25.997
You know what?

19:26.031 --> 19:27.466
There’s nothing out there.

19:29.972 --> 19:32.009
There’s just nothing out there.

19:33.178 --> 19:36.652
You always point, I always look.

19:36.686 --> 19:38.656
There’s nothing out there.

19:41.796 --> 19:44.568
I’ve just realized this is
a sick game you’ve been

19:44.601 --> 19:47.073
playing with Balki for six years
and I’m tired of it.

19:49.010 --> 19:50.513
Just tired of it.

19:50.546 --> 19:52.951
Now if you’ll excuse me,
I’ll be getting those

19:52.985 --> 19:54.688
answers off the bottom
of your foot.

19:58.061 --> 19:59.832
Since you became
pregnant, ladies

19:59.865 --> 20:01.903
are you most comfortable
sleeping on your side...

20:06.077 --> 20:09.017
[humming "Baby Quiz" theme song]

20:23.045 --> 20:26.217
Larry, I’m glad Balki
turned you in. You deserved it.

20:26.251 --> 20:29.724
Actually, Jennifer, I didn’t
have to turn Cousin Larry in.

20:29.759 --> 20:31.963
The game show people saw
the writing on his feet

20:31.996 --> 20:33.031
when we knocked the booth over

20:33.065 --> 20:35.937
and they had to pry us out
with the jaws of life.

20:39.644 --> 20:41.014
If you ask me,
those game show people

20:41.047 --> 20:42.985
take their jobs
way too seriously.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.322
Oh, I don’t know, Larry.

20:45.355 --> 20:48.662
They did let Balki and me finish
the game with another couple.

20:48.696 --> 20:50.633
And we did win that
college scholarship

20:50.666 --> 20:53.038
for...little Robespierre
or Marge.

20:55.209 --> 20:58.081
Come on, Mary Anne. Let’s get
something to eat. I’m hungry.

20:58.115 --> 20:59.785
Good news, I hid some
cookies in the cupboard.

20:59.819 --> 21:01.321
‐Found ’em.
‐Ice cream in the fridge?

21:01.354 --> 21:02.791
‐Had it.
‐Pastrami in the pantry?

21:02.825 --> 21:03.827
Ate it.

21:05.864 --> 21:07.801
Well...

21:07.835 --> 21:10.239
...Balki...I did it again.

21:12.209 --> 21:14.648
And I reached
for the brass ring...

21:16.151 --> 21:19.825
...wound up with a...bill
for a broken

21:19.859 --> 21:21.929
Plexiglas sound‐proof booth.

21:25.369 --> 21:27.306
Well, cousin, there’s
nothing wrong with wanting

21:27.339 --> 21:29.845
a college education
for your child.

21:29.879 --> 21:32.383
It’s just the lying, cheating

21:32.416 --> 21:35.255
deceitful way
you went about it.

21:35.289 --> 21:39.832
But anyway, I, I got them
to give you a parting gift

21:39.865 --> 21:41.802
just as if you were
an honest contestant.

21:44.741 --> 21:47.246
‐You got me a parting gift?
‐I surely did.

21:47.279 --> 21:49.751
Well, that’s very nice of you.

21:49.784 --> 21:51.021
What’d you get me?

21:51.054 --> 21:52.089
Tell them, Johnny!

21:53.927 --> 21:56.665
"The Baby Quiz Home Version!"

21:56.698 --> 21:57.868
Now, Cousin Larry Appleton

21:57.901 --> 21:59.337
can play "The Baby Quiz"
every night!

21:59.370 --> 22:01.041
Back to you, Lance!
Thank you, Johnny.

22:01.074 --> 22:02.243
Oh, no, thank you, Lance!

22:02.276 --> 22:04.213
[laughs]

22:09.223 --> 22:10.225
Alright!

22:11.896 --> 22:14.834
[theme music]

22:20.245 --> 22:23.251
That’d be lower half and again,
I mentioned you get no points.

22:26.057 --> 22:29.263
Larry, I get leg cramps
every night.

22:29.297 --> 22:31.869
Where have you been
the last 32 weeks?

22:31.903 --> 22:33.471
Do we know each other?
Have we met?

22:33.506 --> 22:35.242
Hey, this is j‐just
the first question.

22:35.275 --> 22:36.477
And the next question
is probably going to be

22:36.512 --> 22:38.782
something about
food cravings and, and

22:38.816 --> 22:40.954
I happen to know you have
a thing for ice cream.

22:40.987 --> 22:42.757
‐Pop tarts.
‐Pop tarts. I knew that.

22:44.393 --> 22:45.563
’Johnny?’

22:45.596 --> 22:48.101
We’ll be right back after
a message from our sponsors.

22:48.135 --> 22:52.076
Ladies, unsightly varicose veins
got you down?

22:52.109 --> 22:54.814
Try new flesh‐colored
Hidey Hose.

22:56.351 --> 22:58.088
One size fits all.

22:58.121 --> 22:59.992
Back to you, Lance.
Thank you, Johnny.

23:00.025 --> 23:01.061
No problem, Lance.

23:01.094 --> 23:02.329
[laughs]

23:02.363 --> 23:04.834
Who am I? Alright.
