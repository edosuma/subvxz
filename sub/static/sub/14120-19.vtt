What, you have a wife?

02:44.165 --> 02:45.864
Yes sir, fellow.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.734
And I don't want her
to hear us talking
about any of this.

I bet you don't.

All right,
let's just get to it.

are we talking about?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.139
Gay, straight, don't tell me
you're an old bi.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.542
Porn, as in pornography?

02:56.544 --> 02:59.111
Yeah, you said
you wanted to get into porn.

get into Parm.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.549
What the (BEEP) is Parm?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.584
It's the Italian restaurant
in town

03:05.586 --> 03:08.053
and I believe it's short
for parmesan or something.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.521
This says, "porn"!

03:09.523 --> 03:10.789

03:10.791 --> 03:13.158
I had to write it
with my left hand!

My writing hand got bit
by Lady, our draft horse.

in her old age.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.868
Now, can you help me
get a reservation
to Parm or not?

03:22.870 --> 03:25.270
Why can't you do it,
you old hillbilly?

03:25.272 --> 03:27.539
I wouldn't know
how to go about it.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.274
My wife does
that sort of thing

03:29.276 --> 03:31.343
and I want this
to be a surprise!

03:31.345 --> 03:33.779
-It's our anniversary.
-Aw.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.915
-Do you have a phone?
-I think so.

03:36.917 --> 03:41.053
-My wife usually handles
that sort of thing.
-Oh, my God.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.589
I got a phone, Leslie.
Let me look it up.

-That's the one!

03:48.262 --> 03:50.462
-What time do you want
the reservation?
-Hmm...

03:50.464 --> 03:54.466
Well, this is
a pretty special occasion.
I want it to be romantic.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.469

Better make it 4:00.

to make a reservation today

04:08.781 --> 04:09.881
Okay, thank you.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.583
Yeah,
they don't take reservations.

there's always a table.

thank you all enough.

Well, mystery solved.
Let's get the (BEEP)
out of here.

Well, not every mystery
is going to be a nail-biter.

until we're home?

-What was that?

04:35.509 --> 04:38.610
I'm sure it was nothing.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.612
Is that smoke,
coming from the back
of our car?

04:40.614 --> 04:43.215
Well, I wouldn't know.
I don't ever look back.

04:43.217 --> 04:46.818
I always keep looking forward
just like the old saying,

always keep looking forward."

oil leak for sure,
and if that's all it is,

we can have you back
on the road to Hollywood
in a couple of hours.

I'll give you a call,
when it's ready.

are we supposed to do
for a couple of hours?

05:23.623 --> 05:26.958
Welcome to Parm!
Are you all here
for dinner or supper?

05:26.960 --> 05:29.227
What the (BEEP)
are you talking about?

05:29.229 --> 05:33.398
Well, we just put away
all the dinner menus,
so we only have supper menus.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.768
But if you want a dinner menu,
I can try and get you one.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.237
And what the hell
is the difference?

05:39.239 --> 05:41.840
They're pretty much the same,
but the dinner menu's got
some breakfast items on it.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.943
Oh, God!
There's Leslie.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.746

seat us on this side
of the restaurant?

You can sit wherever you like.

you'd be back sitting
on the beach in Hollywood!

a little car trouble.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.626

grab a quick bite
before we go.

and sit with us.

cannot (BLEEP) the dead.

and they shake you and they
say, "Shut up, you (BLEEP)!"

"Don't worry about any of that
right now, you (BLEEP)!"

is that you are not allowed
to (BLEEP) the living

and the living
better not (BLEEP) you!

17:24.644 --> 17:26.844
It's not just the strippin'.

17:26.846 --> 17:30.882
It's the taking of the
men she strips for
back to our farm

17:30.884 --> 17:32.884
and druggin' them
and sexin' them

17:32.886 --> 17:34.419

"If you continue this
behavior, you'll be
dead to us."

Well, of course she went ahead
and brought another fella
back to the farm

17:50.036 --> 17:52.003
and she sexed him
and cut off his penis

17:52.005 --> 17:53.871
and cooked it up
and put it in a pie.
