01:12.033 --> 01:13.852

01:30.758 --> 01:34.876
You all have been found guilty of witchcraft
and consulting with the devil

01:34.876 --> 01:37.507
If you would save your souls from perdition

01:37.507 --> 01:40.665
Repent now and confess your sins

01:40.665 --> 01:43.915

01:53.795 --> 01:56.582

02:16.082 --> 02:19.536
Wait! ...... Wait!
You said that you're would spare me

02:19.536 --> 02:21.679
Your Soul, child.

02:21.679 --> 02:24.007
Your Soul will be spared.

02:24.007 --> 02:27.116
But the body must be consigned to God
for absolution

02:27.116 --> 02:29.851
No! ... No!
please, I beg you!

02:55.610 --> 02:57.281
Wait!

02:57.629 --> 02:59.906
Their bodies must be pulled up

02:59.906 --> 03:02.459
There are words which must be spoken,
from the  book of Solomon

03:02.559 --> 03:04.746
To unsure they not rise again

03:04.746 --> 03:06.945
They have been hanged and drowned

03:06.945 --> 03:09.769
That's dead Enough for me

03:37.318 --> 03:41.253
Reading from the book

04:10.734 --> 04:13.015
Amen

subtitle:by DUQA

05:27.517 --> 05:32.517
Season of the Witch

05:52.114 --> 05:55.065
Today you are truly blessed

05:55.065 --> 05:59.306
Today, you fight for God himself

05:59.306 --> 06:04.390
Today, yoy're holly warriors ,
baptized in the blood of our unholy enemies

06:04.735 --> 06:06.531
Look to the rabble down there, Behmen

06:07.187 --> 06:09.395
just waiting to meet the Lord

06:09.395 --> 06:13.706
I pity any man whose last face they see is yours Felson

06:14.350 --> 06:19.269
The only sin you will face this day is
Failure

06:19.421 --> 06:22.202
Whomever slays most men
drinks for free

06:22.202 --> 06:24.702
I'll take the 300 left,
you take the 300 on the right

06:25.094 --> 06:27.964
But If we divide them evenly
who will buy tonight’s drinks?

06:28.575 --> 06:30.954
oh, you're buying tonight man.

06:30.954 --> 06:33.456
Prepare your battle!

06:33.456 --> 06:36.287
Fine. I'll kill all 600  myself.

06:37.430 --> 06:41.337
Draw your arms!

06:46.677 --> 06:48.884
Charge!

07:36.696 --> 07:39.684
I have nothing but a powerful thirst baby

07:40.177 --> 07:41.703
You're  buying, my friend

07:56.188 --> 08:01.008
let the sands burn rage with
the blood of advocates!

08:02.400 --> 08:06.742
Strike down our unholy enemies !

08:45.173 --> 08:51.540
do not yield
every enemy of God has fallen!

08:52.595 --> 08:55.954
Do you ever get the felling,
God has many enemies?

08:56.517 --> 08:59.422
being his friend is not so easy either

09:14.939 --> 09:18.200
They are godless people!
Infidels

09:18.200 --> 09:23.091
They sinned against God
and against his only son, Jesus Christ!

09:23.091 --> 09:25.683
They must be punished

09:26.506 --> 09:27.830
Do not fail him

09:27.831 --> 09:31.253
Strike down with his vengeance

09:34.159 --> 09:37.248
Let non survive

09:48.080 --> 09:49.477
{gasping in pain}

10:37.529 --> 10:40.785
Thousands lost souls through the fires of Hell

10:40.785 --> 10:42.519
A glorious day for the Church!

10:42.519 --> 10:44.489
You call this  glorious ?!

10:44.489 --> 10:46.489
Murdering women and children?

10:46.489 --> 10:48.794
Know your place, Knight

10:48.794 --> 10:50.090
you beldge your life for the cause

10:50.091 --> 10:52.705
For God
Not for this

10:53.054 --> 10:55.017
I am a herald of God
in this world

10:55.298 --> 10:57.407
His voice rings ever in my ears

10:57.408 --> 10:59.357
Perhaps it's not his voice you hear

10:59.852 --> 11:02.444
How dare you?
I am the voice of the church!

11:02.515 --> 11:05.554
Bathed in truth and blameless
in light of the Lord

11:05.566 --> 11:09.102
You're no more than
a drop of blood on his hands!

11:09.102 --> 11:12.930
Who controls your insolent tougne, Behmen?

11:21.936 --> 11:24.737
Let's get the hell out of here.

11:27.535 --> 11:29.332
You cannot leave!

11:30.655 --> 11:32.821
Who's going stop us?

12:07.875 --> 12:10.338
sheep roaming free
and no shepherd in sight

12:10.459 --> 12:13.110
Did they jumped the fence ?!

12:13.110 --> 12:14.520
All of them?

12:17.334 --> 12:19.676
We have been walking all day
and  have not passed a soul

12:20.903 --> 12:24.632
Keep your souls
And only find a chicken.

12:42.870 --> 12:45.125
Hello !

12:49.506 --> 12:52.083
Is anyone here?

13:04.003 --> 13:06.750
Hello !

13:41.229 --> 13:43.419
What happened to them ?!

13:43.419 --> 13:45.309
I do not know

14:12.427 --> 14:15.523
We have seen so much death you and I

14:15.523 --> 14:17.616
Some deserved, some not

14:17.616 --> 14:20.776
But What is one do, to deserve a death like that ?

14:20.776 --> 14:22.370
Nothing

14:34.809 --> 14:37.650
Finally a town!

14:37.650 --> 14:40.124
We might be recognized

14:40.964 --> 14:42.966
We should go around , Behmen

14:42.966 --> 14:44.666
Go where ?!

14:44.999 --> 14:48.334
The horses won't carry us
They are farm animals

14:48.334 --> 14:50.662
We need Proper Horses
food ...

14:51.029 --> 14:52.890
... Provisions

15:07.332 --> 15:09.775
Please, Let them come to me!

15:09.875 --> 15:11.140
I beg you!

15:11.236 --> 15:14.329
please, Take us!
No more!

15:23.451 --> 15:26.598
Lord all mighty, Heavenly Father

15:26.598 --> 15:31.235
Accept the pain and suffering
we restore upon our selves

15:31.262 --> 15:35.633
Find deed to the awkward to free us!
From this Terrible ......

15:36.695 --> 15:38.930
What madness is this?

15:38.930 --> 15:40.260
Plague

15:41.588 --> 15:43.320
Plague ?!

15:43.712 --> 15:44.618
Like No other

15:44.696 --> 15:47.138
the pestilence over all the land

15:47.584 --> 15:50.874
- is there no cure?
- None.

15:50.874 --> 15:53.074
How long is it been so?

15:53.329 --> 15:56.047
three years in a season

15:56.047 --> 16:00.037
- How many died?
- Some says as many in three and four

16:01.173 --> 16:07.079
But with my own hands I have buried
two children and the wife who born them

16:07.079 --> 16:09.219
But, How is it you you don’t know this?

16:09.219 --> 16:12.945
We're travellers
We have only recently returned

16:17.283 --> 16:18.909
Here you are

16:18.909 --> 16:21.200
two of my finest

16:21.200 --> 16:22.666
Thank you

16:31.381 --> 16:32.682
Leave it!

16:42.035 --> 16:44.041
Felson, this way

16:44.756 --> 16:46.434
What is it now?

16:46.933 --> 16:49.478
They saw my sword's Crest

16:50.311 --> 16:52.930
I told we should've gone around

16:53.166 --> 16:56.226
You two!
Stand fast!

16:56.226 --> 16:57.710
Shit!

17:15.204 --> 17:17.231
Fine

17:17.618 --> 17:19.390
Come with me

17:21.492 --> 17:23.308
Drop it!

17:31.628 --> 17:34.437
Remove the hood and the mask

17:38.224 --> 17:40.478
Arrest these deserters

17:43.645 --> 17:45.095
Wait!

17:46.767 --> 17:48.731
Let me see that

17:55.175 --> 17:56.979
this is yours?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.315
Follow me

18:05.144 --> 18:08.045
I hope we are on our way to dinner

18:08.045 --> 18:09.535
What you want with us, Priest?

18:10.399 --> 18:13.436
that's not up for me to say

18:23.236 --> 18:24.146
Pardon me, your eminent

18:24.330 --> 18:26.467
What is it, Debelzaq?

18:26.631 --> 18:30.079
This the knight's sword

18:30.079 --> 18:32.579
Come closer

18:48.379 --> 18:51.165
Tell me your name

18:51.165 --> 18:53.725
I am Behmen of Blybrook.

18:53.725 --> 18:56.891
Behmen, yes ...

18:56.891 --> 18:59.759
And your comrade, Felson.

18:59.759 --> 19:03.461
Your names are known to me

19:03.461 --> 19:07.515
Your victories have become legends

19:08.934 --> 19:16.067
Yes, I'm stricken...
The Plague is everywhere

19:16.067 --> 19:18.444
It's a curse called up from Hell

19:18.489 --> 19:21.242
Brought upon us by
The Black Witch

19:21.242 --> 19:23.546
The Black Witch ?!

19:24.214 --> 19:27.120
I myself heard the confession

19:27.120 --> 19:32.481
The Witch must be taken
the abbey of Severak

19:32.481 --> 19:38.206
Where the Monks possess the last
copy of an ancient book

19:38.206 --> 19:42.233
rituals that will destroy
the Witch's powers,

19:43.139 --> 19:48.060
And End the plague

19:48.060 --> 19:50.334
What is this to do with us?

19:50.334 --> 19:55.811
Our ranks have been decimated

19:55.811 --> 19:59.281
You must deliver her

19:59.281 --> 20:03.834
My best knight, Eckhart
has already pledged his services

20:03.878 --> 20:07.596
As has our priest Debelzaq

20:07.596 --> 20:10.394
I ask the same of you

20:10.394 --> 20:15.018
Will you serve the church, once more?

20:15.018 --> 20:17.590
- I can not
- you swear in front of God

20:17.989 --> 20:21.856
- Have you been released from this vow ?
- My vow is to god

20:21.856 --> 20:24.991
Not the men how murder in his name.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.367
You know the penalty for desertion

20:27.367 --> 20:31.912
I ask again
Behmen of Blybrook,

20:32.929 --> 20:37.851
Do you serve God and the church ?

20:37.851 --> 20:40.586
I serve the church no more

20:45.508 --> 20:46.667
In there

20:48.103 --> 20:49.702
Both of you

20:58.468 --> 21:01.667
What do they do with deserters any way?

21:01.904 --> 21:03.887
hang them?

21:04.621 --> 21:06.731
Burn them ?

21:06.731 --> 21:09.028
Probably both

21:09.028 --> 21:10.137
I know

21:10.531 --> 21:15.861
If I the one who say on the matter
I prefer to hanging

21:44.118 --> 21:46.224
Is that the Witch ?!

21:46.475 --> 21:49.900
That It is not what I see

21:49.900 --> 21:52.342
The priest said she confessed.

21:52.342 --> 21:55.918
We both know the church
can be Most ... Persuasive

21:55.918 --> 21:57.647
{laughter}
ahh

21:57.647 --> 21:59.391
I am Sorry, I Put you into this Felson

21:59.522 --> 22:06.179
Ah, These dungeons go
and this one is not so bad

22:06.179 --> 22:09.277
We spent nights in much worse places than this

22:09.277 --> 22:11.173
At least I have

22:11.173 --> 22:13.900
What's that smell?

22:14.218 --> 22:16.809
That would be you

22:34.388 --> 22:37.657
{Mocking}
"I serve the church No more"

22:40.499 --> 22:43.217
Did you see the priest face?

22:43.217 --> 22:47.465
He looked like someone pissed in his holly water

23:06.767 --> 23:10.246
<I> They are godless people!
Infidels

23:10.247 --> 23:14.973
<I> They sinned against God
and against his only son, Jesus Christ!

23:14.973 --> 23:16.350
<I>They must be punished

23:16.351 --> 23:17.351
{gasping}

23:20.053 --> 23:32.144
{Weeping and Sobbing}

23:52.751 --> 23:55.324
You want to speak with the Cardinal?

23:55.325 --> 23:58.770
Tell him we will deliver the girl to Severak,
on one condition

23:58.770 --> 24:01.278
That she is given a fair trail

24:01.278 --> 24:05.533
- You cannot bargain with the church.
- This is not for your church.

24:06.600 --> 24:09.606
And we want our weapons returned

24:10.410 --> 24:14.317
And all charges dismissed

24:17.715 --> 24:21.236
We're here.
The abbey is is here

24:21.236 --> 24:25.426
The distance is nearly 400 leagues
That's roughly Six days travel

24:25.426 --> 24:27.284
As you can see,
We charted a course.

24:27.284 --> 24:29.486
You would lead us through here?

24:30.002 --> 24:31.770
That is the most direct route, yes.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.550
Across the river, through ...

24:33.550 --> 24:37.884
300 Leagues of heavy forest,
and a mountain pass?

24:37.884 --> 24:39.511
This forest is called
Wormwood

24:40.143 --> 24:41.515
It's not a place to be trifled with.

24:41.625 --> 24:44.194
Men have lost their way there,
and were never to be seen again.

24:44.399 --> 24:48.318
Tell me, Priest,
have you ever made a journey yourself?

24:51.260 --> 24:52.216
No.

24:52.516 --> 24:53.234
Naturally.

24:53.967 --> 24:55.848
these are the best maps in the land

24:55.848 --> 24:58.074
But, We will do better
To have a guide.

24:58.074 --> 25:02.159
You know, Someone who has travelled
from here to there.

25:02.159 --> 25:05.608
A tax collector, perhaps a merchant?

25:07.437 --> 25:10.600
There is someone, but ...

25:15.129 --> 25:16.262
Ahhh , .... Visitors!

25:17.062 --> 25:17.136
What can I do for you gentlemen?

25:17.227 --> 25:19.832
Perhaps, you would like to  help me with fruit,
or kick me in the groin

25:22.361 --> 25:23.602
You're Hagamar?
the swindler?!

25:23.702 --> 25:24.749
Yes.

25:24.849 --> 25:25.339
{Mumbling}
I mean no!

25:25.439 --> 25:27.831
I am Hagamar,
but I never swindled anyone.

25:27.731 --> 25:30.773
I sold relics.

25:30.774 --> 25:31.774
Genuine Relics

25:30.773 --> 25:32.816
Where did sell your trinkets?

25:32.816 --> 25:36.299
Everywhere.
I have happy customers from here to Prague.

25:37.922 --> 25:39.740
And in Severak?

25:39.740 --> 25:42.227
Yes.  The monks.

25:42.227 --> 25:44.819
I sold them the tail of an asteroid
and a flag from Egypt
{ flag :type of flowed }

25:44.918 --> 25:48.020
Quite a barging ,I am sure

25:48.020 --> 25:50.554
Then you know the way to the abbey.

25:50.554 --> 25:52.303
Like the back of my hand.

25:52.303 --> 25:54.711
I'd happy to draw  you a map, only ...

25:54.895 --> 25:58.240
The bailiff has prepared to pardon you

26:00.240 --> 26:02.742
On one condition.

26:02.742 --> 26:05.365
You serve as our guide to Severak.

26:05.365 --> 26:07.228
Condition accepted.

26:08.122 --> 26:11.271
If I were to release you however,
and you attempt to flee ...

26:11.303 --> 26:13.423
Such thoughts are beneath you sir

26:13.423 --> 26:16.957
I swear by all the saints,
me they struck me dead , were I to lie.

26:17.773 --> 26:20.296
and you will have to get in line behind me.

26:21.169 --> 26:22.870
Do we understand each other?

26:30.183 --> 26:34.747
the Witch is unconscious.
she was given a powerful sedative in her food  last night

26:34.747 --> 26:36.217
Open the cell.

26:37.623 --> 26:40.347
We will be removing the witch for transport.

26:53.238 --> 26:55.280
she's just a girl.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.408
Do be deceived.

27:10.995 --> 27:12.496
Felson!

27:13.514 --> 27:16.536
Hold her!

27:17.392 --> 27:20.222
The sooner we get her to
Severak, the better.

27:23.431 --> 27:25.679
Now she is sedated

27:42.970 --> 27:44.622
Who is that ?

27:44.622 --> 27:47.040
-The Witch.
- Witch?

27:47.040 --> 27:49.322
Nobody said anything about a witch.

27:49.322 --> 27:52.590
What did you think we are going to Severak,
to sell trinkets?

27:52.590 --> 27:54.926
Kill the witch!

27:54.926 --> 27:56.606
You gave us this infection!

27:56.688 --> 27:59.616
you brought the wrath of good upon us!
take the witch out of our land

28:01.016 --> 28:03.516
And take the plague with you!

28:07.648 --> 28:08.904
Demon!

28:21.669 --> 28:30.977
{Latin Hymns & prayers}

28:50.795 --> 28:52.427
She is watching me

28:52.863 --> 28:56.164
put your mind on something else.
She is trying to frighten you.

28:56.384 --> 28:58.291
It's Working.

29:00.388 --> 29:03.072
How did you come upon this girl?

29:03.072 --> 29:05.233
She was found just outside of Maburn , wandering ...

29:05.233 --> 29:09.794
Muttering strange things words, no one can understand

29:10.106 --> 29:12.928
- This makes her a witch?
- No, but it's a sign.

29:13.735 --> 29:17.769
And with in the fourth night of her arrival,
Plague has swept over us.

29:17.769 --> 29:20.988
It was the same for every town she passed

29:20.988 --> 29:25.425
there no take of such a girl
passing through my village ...

29:25.425 --> 29:28.579
yet, the plague came

29:41.252 --> 29:43.835
She is stronger than she looks.

29:45.941 --> 29:47.347
Do you believe she is a witch?!

29:47.688 --> 29:51.881
But you felt her strength
would You say, it was that of a girl?

29:51.881 --> 29:55.576
I have seen girls destroy men
without lifting a finger.

29:55.576 --> 29:57.415
How many times do we need to go over this?

29:57.416 --> 29:59.907
We were in France!
for god sake

30:02.907 --> 30:04.867
And things she did in the bed chamber .

30:05.016 --> 30:08.397
She robbed you out of the year's wages.

30:08.397 --> 30:09.904
Yes, but ...

30:10.212 --> 30:12.964
... gave me so much in return.

30:15.261 --> 30:16.213
Look at us.

30:15.876 --> 30:18.762
Barely a month out of service to the church
and here we are !

30:18.762 --> 30:22.701
deserters, in the service of the church.

30:24.946 --> 30:27.263
You know we are being followed.

30:31.238 --> 30:34.017
Let's give him a royal welcome

30:53.057 --> 30:55.164
Come of the horse.

31:04.324 --> 31:07.203
Who are you and why you're following us?

31:08.679 --> 31:10.929
I asked you a question boy.

31:12.175 --> 31:14.726
He's an altar boy
and services to the Cardinal.

31:14.726 --> 31:16.522
My name is Kay.

31:16.522 --> 31:19.913
My father was a knight.
Yuran Wolenbar.

31:19.913 --> 31:23.425
He also fought in "Ambrose"
Perhaps you have heard his name.

31:25.270 --> 31:29.094
- What do you want?
- I want to come with you to Severak.

31:29.094 --> 31:31.020
Easy boy.

31:31.741 --> 31:36.085
To pledge myself to your service

31:36.085 --> 31:39.822
in exchange, for which I ask your word
that you will vouch for me upon our return...

31:39.902 --> 31:41.712
So I may be knighted.

31:44.374 --> 31:46.659
{laughing in Mockery}

31:48.228 --> 31:52.331
The services of an altar boy
I feel safer already

31:52.095 --> 31:55.998
I would have you know, I have been written in the lists twice
and I won flags for valour.

31:56.176 --> 31:58.644
That's not a tournament, kid.
Go back to your mother.

31:58.952 --> 32:01.137
This is a free road old man

32:01.375 --> 32:03.442
And I do not need your permission
to travel it.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.628
Give the lad a chance to retract the remark

32:10.649 --> 32:12.634
My sincere apologies.

32:14.961 --> 32:16.719
Not to me, to him

32:16.720 --> 32:19.630
That I cannot. He insulted me first.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.344
I am going to Teach this one some manners.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.801
go easy, Felson.
Use the other hand.

32:27.801 --> 32:30.678
I do not want him dead.
Just send him on his way.

32:31.487 --> 32:33.135
Be quick about it.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.696
With pleasure

32:52.078 --> 32:54.345
Not bad for an altar boy.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.598
What the devil was that?

33:12.912 --> 33:15.594
Stand and Fight like  a man,
you little jackrabbit.

33:29.394 --> 33:30.816
Enough!

33:32.979 --> 33:35.567
Perhaps you can be of service.

33:48.538 --> 33:53.365
I heard what the cardinal said,
about Your heroism in the Crusades.

33:53.365 --> 33:56.476
I'd have gone too but I was too young.

33:56.757 --> 33:59.886
you're  one of the lucky ones!

33:59.886 --> 34:03.119
Well, Tell me about it, where did you enlist?

34:05.301 --> 34:08.733
It was a priest how came to Felson's village .

34:08.733 --> 34:13.154
He told us: "whoever went on Crusade,
would receive blessings from the church"..

34:13.154 --> 34:15.271
"Remission from sin".

34:14.971 --> 34:18.607
It was the Part about sin that
perk young Felson is interest

34:18.607 --> 34:20.043
That's not true.

34:20.045 --> 34:24.405
So he asks the priest :
"what sins would be forgiven"...

34:24.405 --> 34:26.373
"Would they forgive adultery?"

34:26.373 --> 34:32.585
The priest says :
"Yes, for two year bledge".

34:33.379 --> 34:35.260
"What about theft?"

34:35.260 --> 34:39.581
"Yes, for a three year bledge "

34:39.581 --> 34:44.007
So Felson mulls it over and says to the priest

34:44.007 --> 34:46.967
"better Sign me up for ten"

35:01.636 --> 35:03.853
I brought you some food.

35:04.693 --> 35:07.434
And warmth.

35:11.355 --> 35:13.850
You're not like the others.

35:16.368 --> 35:18.251
You're kind.

35:33.728 --> 35:37.115
Was it Debelzaq, who hurt you?

35:41.796 --> 35:44.902
This place you taking me  ...

35:44.972 --> 35:47.366
What will happen to me there?

35:47.366 --> 35:51.461
Your innocence or guilt will be decided

35:51.461 --> 35:55.864
There was a girl in my village
who was suspected of being a witch.

35:57.830 --> 36:03.228
They put stones in her pockets
and cast her into the lake.

36:03.228 --> 36:07.688
If she drown,
they would have known she was human.

36:07.688 --> 36:12.873
But she did not.
She lived.

36:13.234 --> 36:17.456
They called it proof of magic,
and burned at the stake.

36:17.456 --> 36:20.918
Nothing of the kind will happen to you.

36:20.918 --> 36:23.794
You will be given a fair trial.

36:23.794 --> 36:26.192
You have my word on that

36:33.993 --> 36:37.893
she said everything ?

36:38.094 --> 36:41.994
why are you asking?

37:02.900 --> 37:05.494
Perhaps someone else should take the first watch

37:05.494 --> 37:07.658
I'll go.

37:08.352 --> 37:11.898
Do not worry, lad.
there will be plenty of time between here and  Severak.

37:34.900 --> 37:37.579
I came to relieve you.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.526
you are tired?

37:42.979 --> 37:45.150
No. No! ....

37:45.781 --> 37:48.574
I do not sleep much these days.

37:50.417 --> 37:54.625
I was thinking how much
the girl reminds me of my daughter.

38:01.625 --> 38:04.170
Her name was Mila.

38:06.157 --> 38:08.764
Tell me, Father ...

38:08.764 --> 38:12.966
You say the Cardinal has given his word
that she will have a fair trial.

38:12.966 --> 38:16.806
But has he not also given his word end to the plague?

38:16.906 --> 38:18.961
What do you suggesting?

38:18.961 --> 38:24.011
Can you imagine the reaction of the people
if she were not to be found guilty of witchcraft

38:24.535 --> 38:28.741
No Father, you know as well as I
the church cannot afford that ...

38:28.741 --> 38:30.453
Not now.

38:30.804 --> 38:32.987
No.

38:32.987 --> 38:36.081
No, Our responsibility is to deliver her for trail.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.472
The monks will decide her fate.

38:39.865 --> 38:41.552
Exactly.

38:41.864 --> 38:45.992
The monks will decide her fate.
and I will not be a part of this.

38:45.992 --> 38:49.891
No will the others, hopefully
when they have heard what I have to say
And to hope that no others,
when they hear what I said.

38:49.891 --> 38:51.113
Wait!

38:51.437 --> 38:53.286
Please do not go.

38:53.286 --> 38:55.998
Please, Do not leave me alone with him.

38:56.900 --> 38:57.100
are you afraid?

39:01.900 --> 39:02.800
Listen to me

39:03.301 --> 39:04.101
Calm Down

39:08.278 --> 39:09.613
Give me that key!

39:11.082 --> 39:12.775
{Screaming from pain}

39:19.223 --> 39:20.779
How did she escape?

39:23.396 --> 39:25.669
she took the key from around my neck.

39:27.663 --> 39:29.514
which way did she go?

39:37.154 --> 39:40.294
Maybe she followed this road to the village.

39:54.082 --> 39:56.312
Kay and Eckhart that way

40:12.597 --> 40:17.210
{Very quiet surroundings }
{only sounds of horses footfalls }

40:39.093 --> 40:47.752
{Winds blowing}
{Doors or windows slapping}

40:59.820 --> 41:01.683
She's in the square!

42:31.101 --> 42:33.765
this is a grave......
this is a mass grave.

42:37.528 --> 42:39.520
<I> Father

42:40.813 --> 42:42.889
Wait here.

42:51.451 --> 42:52.705
<I> Father

42:52.705 --> 42:54.095
Mila?

42:54.095 --> 42:55.881
<I>  Father

42:57.287 --> 42:58.695
<I>'m here.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.157
Eckhart!

43:09.409 --> 43:11.346
<I>- Mila?!!!!
-  Father

43:11.346 --> 43:14.210
<I>- Mila ....
-  Father , where are you?

43:14.210 --> 43:18.508
Mila! My child.
-  Father? is that you

43:19.222 --> 43:21.838
<I>- Do not run away!
- Father.

43:22.268 --> 43:23.551
Mila ?!!

43:26.304 --> 43:30.081
<I>-  baba.
- ohhhh, Mila ?!

43:33.395 --> 43:37.087
Eckhart!

43:37.831 --> 43:40.210
Felson! Behmen!

43:40.210 --> 43:42.033
Where you are?

43:42.508 --> 43:44.577
He came running out of no where

43:45.182 --> 43:48.021
Why did not he stopped?
Why did not he see me?

43:49.785 --> 43:53.040
what dear God?!!!!!,
what have I done?

43:54.900 --> 43:57.559
He looked me in the eye, but he did not see me.

43:59.551 --> 44:02.099
She called me Mila.

44:12.778 --> 44:14.122
Behmen.

44:27.060 --> 44:29.467
I had to Run,
I had no choice.

44:29.502 --> 44:31.874
I could not let him
touch me again.

44:31.909 --> 44:32.924
I'm so sorry.

44:32.959 --> 44:35.499
Please
Please, do not take me back there.

44:35.718 --> 44:37.708
Please, I beg you
please ...

44:49.320 --> 44:51.779
Heavenly Father, we pray thee.

44:51.814 --> 44:55.155
take thy servant Johan Eckhart,
down to the Heavenly realm

44:55.813 --> 44:58.655
For he was a soldier of the cross
and fought in thy name

44:59.208 --> 45:01.593
And in the name of Thy only Son,
Jesus Christ.

45:03.847 --> 45:06.422
And Thus did he die
for the  glory of God.

45:08.927 --> 45:09.952
Amen.

45:11.501 --> 45:12.491
Amen.

45:19.188 --> 45:21.002
Would Anyone care to offer some words?

45:23.128 --> 45:26.267
let his sacrifice, not be in vain.

45:33.041 --> 45:34.549
Behmen!

45:35.773 --> 45:37.378
I must speak with you

45:39.425 --> 45:40.360
What is it now, Priest?

45:40.365 --> 45:42.052
You must warn the others
be careful in her presence.

45:42.087 --> 45:44.833
Not to , not to discuss personal matters,
things she might use against ...

45:44.868 --> 45:46.050
Listen to me!

45:46.675 --> 45:48.537
It was the witch,
killed Eckhart.

45:50.175 --> 45:52.691
You ,,,{bumbling}You heard what Kay said.
his mind was not his own.

45:53.565 --> 45:55.236
She overheard us talking
of his daughter.

45:56.361 --> 45:58.129
What exactly are you suggesting?

45:58.766 --> 46:01.315
She sees the weakness that lies in our hearts

46:01.768 --> 46:04.738
And once she sees that,
She will use against us.

46:53.769 --> 46:54.960
Crusader!

46:56.847 --> 46:58.620
I am truly grateful
for your help.

46:59.880 --> 47:01.259
You're very brave.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.293
A man like you could never stand
to see young girl come to any harm

47:06.763 --> 47:09.165
Debelzaq believes ,
you are the blame for Eckhart death.

47:10.678 --> 47:14.835
And you believe him?
After what he did to me?

47:15.936 --> 47:19.211
I had no reason to harm Eckhart
He was nothing but kind to me.

47:19.819 --> 47:21.523
He told me , I look like his daughter.

47:25.022 --> 47:27.259
I can see his death weighs heavy on your mind

47:30.837 --> 47:33.215
Allow me to ease your pain.

47:39.657 --> 47:43.404
Some good deeds can done
even from behind bars.

47:55.820 --> 47:58.701
Kay remember this,
It was not your fault.

47:59.001 --> 48:01.761
It was the witch.
No one else.

48:01.841 --> 48:03.601
he died by my sword.

48:03.636 --> 48:06.176
-It Could just as easily have been another's
- But it was not.

48:06.831 --> 48:10.000
It was mine. I killed him.

48:26.990 --> 48:28.842
Why are we stopped?

48:30.702 --> 48:32.805
You call that a bridge?

48:32.840 --> 48:35.062
Last time I saw it
Was eight or nine years ago.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.577
I remember it differently.

48:37.760 --> 48:40.190
is that our reward for taking a swindler as our guide.

48:40.260 --> 48:42.591
I told you,
I am not a swindler

48:42.626 --> 48:44.923
You're not much of a guide either,
are you?!

48:46.829 --> 48:49.234
How we are supposed to get across this rotting temper
{ temper= The degree of rigidity and flexibility}

48:49.269 --> 48:51.152
You are Blaming me
for the bridge?

48:51.187 --> 48:53.002
You're the one who led us to it.

48:53.037 --> 48:54.140
You're the one ...

48:54.768 --> 48:56.652
Behmen!

49:11.804 --> 49:15.748
{footfalls & scrunching of wood noise}

49:20.433 --> 49:22.829
{powerful wind}

49:46.664 --> 49:50.706
Take everything of the wagon
bring the horses across. One by one.

50:03.765 --> 50:05.674
It will be on my count of three.

50:16.268 --> 50:19.675
One, two, three!

50:43.696 --> 50:45.952
My hands!

50:49.226 --> 50:50.244
ahhhhh....!

50:50.553 --> 50:52.727
Cannot hold out much longer !

51:13.487 --> 51:14.867
Help!

51:30.961 --> 51:35.211
Hagamar, hitch a rope to the horses,
that we will use them to pull the wagon.

51:53.136 --> 51:56.222
{wood cracking }

52:20.995 --> 52:23.677
If you let me out,
it'll be lighter.

52:24.763 --> 52:26.542
Please, I can help.

52:28.401 --> 52:30.494
- It won't hold.
- It will

52:30.765 --> 52:31.838
Push.

52:39.021 --> 52:41.005
Push!

52:43.902 --> 52:48.002
you won't make it.
Let me out.

52:55.321 --> 52:57.204
- Come on!
- Push!

53:15.980 --> 53:17.637
that Was a little too close !

53:18.342 --> 53:21.740
I've saved your ass a hundred times.

53:31.406 --> 53:33.545
It would be a shame if you bleed
to death

53:38.392 --> 53:40.081
Thank you

54:23.894 --> 54:25.242
What is this place?

54:28.719 --> 54:30.783
Hagamar, where are we?

54:32.813 --> 54:34.453
The Wormwood forest.

55:01.482 --> 55:04.190
Damn fog.
like a veil before my eyes.

55:04.428 --> 55:05.936
We haven't strayed from the path ,
have we??

55:05.971 --> 55:08.157
I can barely see my own hand
in front of my face.

55:08.803 --> 55:11.533
The only reason you're around
is because you claimed you knew the way.

55:11.753 --> 55:13.384
I know the way,
it's just I can't see the way.

55:50.661 --> 55:52.456
Kay told me
what happened on the bridge.

55:54.020 --> 55:55.362
He says , you saved his life.

55:56.676 --> 55:59.873
With one hand ...
Hard to believe.

56:01.472 --> 56:04.244
We believe what we want to believe.

56:07.895 --> 56:09.717
Do you believe I am a witch,
Behmen?

56:12.996 --> 56:16.349
You are not afraid of me
are you?

56:50.312 --> 56:52.284
Trouble sleeping?

56:53.991 --> 56:55.258
Myself as well

56:59.132 --> 57:02.164
I am not sure if it's the fog,  the altitude ...

57:03.092 --> 57:06.685
It's unsettling,
Even for a knight.

57:07.946 --> 57:10.446
Let alone spineless scavenger like myself !!

57:10.804 --> 57:12.634
That's not what I meant.

57:14.351 --> 57:19.968
No..! .
Behmen, how many more are going to die before we reach a Severak?

57:20.792 --> 57:24.273
- None, if I can help it.
- And if you can't , what then what?

57:25.758 --> 57:28.686
Forgive me if I seem reluctant
to put my life in your hands

57:28.890 --> 57:31.687
But I have a better solution.
We kill the bitch!

57:31.722 --> 57:33.194
Here and now, be done with it

57:33.229 --> 57:35.355
We tell whose back in "Mol bow",
she tried to escape.

57:35.717 --> 57:38.354
She meant us harm ...
What can we do? we had no choice.

57:40.090 --> 57:42.666
And who will be the wiser?

57:46.183 --> 57:47.519
I, for one.

57:57.405 --> 57:58.604
Did you hear that?

57:59.056 --> 58:00.658
- What it's it? What is happening?
- Listen.

58:00.954 --> 58:01.593
Quite.

58:01.594 --> 58:02.594
{many wolves howling}

58:18.488 --> 58:20.841
Wolfs

58:26.715 --> 58:27.703
What do we do?

58:31.828 --> 58:33.992
Kill as many can.

59:42.819 --> 59:46.922
-Oh no.
- Get the horses, I'll take the wagon.

01:00:52.597 --> 01:00:54.175
Behmen!

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.337
It's too late.
We cannot help him.

01:01:45.378 --> 01:01:47.154
{slap the horses by the whip}

01:01:52.343 --> 01:01:54.492
Behmen! What are you doing?

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.263
Behmen, what are you doing?

01:01:57.435 --> 01:02:00.358
he is doing what comes naturally
killing the innocent.

01:02:00.393 --> 01:02:01.972
You cannot do this

01:02:02.007 --> 01:02:04.549
Step aside
Two lives have already been lost.

01:02:04.576 --> 01:02:06.226
No one grieves for that
more than I.

01:02:06.261 --> 01:02:08.325
Step aside !
or this arrow will be yours!

01:02:08.575 --> 01:02:10.757
If we fault her now , those lives will have been lost in vain
LU is and now, were wasted in vain.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.043
Or will not be lost!!
Four lives will be spared.

01:02:14.078 --> 01:02:16.664
And What are four lives, compared
with the thousands more will be lost ?!!!

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:17.961
if this plague is not ended.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.555
I know, there may be no room
in your heart for God, Behmen.

01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:22.977
But in my heart
I know he would not abandon us.

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:24.620
I God's name ...

01:02:25.369 --> 01:02:30.993
No man has spilt more blood
in God's name than I

01:02:32.362 --> 01:02:35.300
benevolent God,
what are odds thus takes a man

01:02:36.808 --> 01:02:39.735
If you kill her,
you will not have God to blame

01:02:41.045 --> 01:02:42.434
only yourself.

01:02:54.995 --> 01:02:57.573
He ends the say

01:02:58.434 --> 01:03:01.861
Look. Severak ...

01:03:21.022 --> 01:03:22.999
We've come a long way, Behmen.

01:03:23.604 --> 01:03:27.949
Crossed oceans , deserts of ...
Seen things a few men have seen

01:03:31.874 --> 01:03:35.263
When this is over,
I think I like see the valley where I was born.

01:03:36.237 --> 01:03:37.763
And you?

01:03:38.609 --> 01:03:40.560
I have no such yearnings for home.

01:03:40.763 --> 01:03:42.327
Ohh .. ,Then come with me.

01:03:42.577 --> 01:03:47.588
I We will show you my home
and will in the hall where my forefathers sat
and a drink ale .

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.478
And tell tales, few men have lived to tell

01:03:53.479 --> 01:03:55.479
A fewer still will believe!...

01:03:56.908 --> 01:04:01.014
Either we will know the truth, my friend.
We will know , ...

01:04:17.801 --> 01:04:19.811
Hello !...

01:04:23.563 --> 01:04:25.162
Is anyone there?

01:05:13.383 --> 01:05:15.378
- Where are the monks?
- The chapel.

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:16.973
At this time , they should be in vespers.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.243
My brothers, forgive the intrusion,
But we have travelled far.

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:57.848
It cannot be!.

01:06:00.929 --> 01:06:02.261
He would not abandon us.

01:06:04.521 --> 01:06:06.228
God would not abandon us.

01:06:17.929 --> 01:06:22.147
We must go,
There is no hope here. Only the plague ...

01:06:23.293 --> 01:06:24.272
Go where ?!!

01:06:26.474 --> 01:06:28.757
these men were our hope

01:06:30.131 --> 01:06:34.179
We are in God's hands now
Prayer is our only salvation.

01:06:35.584 --> 01:06:37.943
- Our Lord in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name ...

01:06:37.945 --> 01:06:39.206
Debelzaq!

01:06:39.241 --> 01:06:40.789
Thy kingdom come
They will be done ...

01:06:40.824 --> 01:06:42.190
Debelzaq!

01:06:42.225 --> 01:06:43.612
As it is in heaven

01:06:43.647 --> 01:06:44.661
Give us this day, our daily bread

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.980
And Forgive us our trespasses

01:06:46.014 --> 01:06:46.956
Get up!

01:06:46.991 --> 01:06:48.360
We forgive those how trespass against us

01:06:48.395 --> 01:06:49.260
Get up!

01:06:49.265 --> 01:06:51.074
And lead us nary to temptation

01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:52.884
But deliver us from evil ..

01:07:05.754 --> 01:07:08.324
{praying}

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.938
Debelzaq ...

01:07:39.542 --> 01:07:42.549
the Key of Solomon
book of which the cardinal spoke.

01:07:43.924 --> 01:07:47.305
Within this pages is saved to be
all the rituals, prayers, and incantations

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.977
Used by holy men ,
throughout the ages

01:07:50.012 --> 01:07:51.200
To defend against the forces of evil

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.685
Can ...

01:07:55.565 --> 01:07:57.427
... You perform the ritual?

01:08:08.524 --> 01:08:10.185
What have we here?

01:08:10.326 --> 01:08:13.288
Is This the fair trial
you promised me, Behmen?

01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:16.264
you see with your own fate.

01:08:21.736 --> 01:08:24.635
Let it be known to all here present
And before God, himself

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:27.856
That this woman
stands accused of witchcraft,

01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:30.986
That she is admitted to call up the plague
against all mankind.

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:32.883
I'm flattered.

01:08:33.285 --> 01:08:34.928
But I must confess ...

01:08:36.569 --> 01:08:38.776
I have deceived you ...

01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:41.197
You think you can save yourself by recanting
But you're wrong

01:08:41.412 --> 01:08:43.040
Speak the truth now before God!

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.160
The Truth?

01:08:45.152 --> 01:08:47.460
Do not talk to me of the truth,
you hypocrite

01:08:48.852 --> 01:08:53.120
For centuries you and your ilk
have  been burning, hanging, crucifying

01:08:53.417 --> 01:08:55.496
Anyone who stood in their way.

01:08:59.002 --> 01:09:00.808
In truth,
I shall thank you.

01:09:01.608 --> 01:09:03.558
The church has sent more souls
to Perdition

01:09:03.776 --> 01:09:07.618
than all of the wars, famines
and pestilences is put together.

01:09:08.401 --> 01:09:09.654
That's a lie, Witch!

01:09:09.689 --> 01:09:11.392
Debelzaq, the ritual!

01:09:11.393 --> 01:09:12.393
{Latin Hymns & prayers}

01:09:28.090 --> 01:09:31.261
And you, Behmen?
All you needed was a child to save .

01:09:32.392 --> 01:09:35.607
Someone to ease your pitiful guilt

01:09:36.042 --> 01:09:39.452
Do you truly think that saving one racked wave,
would change anything?

01:09:41.237 --> 01:09:44.591
Come Behmen.
Your sins are legend.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:48.269
How many innocent
have fallen beneath that very blade ?!

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:53.348
<I> They are godless people
Infidels

01:09:53.813 --> 01:09:57.845
<I>They sinned against God
and against his only son, Jesus Christ!

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.514
<I>They must be punished

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:02.488
How could you know?

01:10:06.392 --> 01:10:08.348
This no witch!

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:10.898
This no witch ...

01:10:20.761 --> 01:10:22.249
Do not utter those words!

01:11:44.465 --> 01:11:46.258
We're goanna need more
Holly water .

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:55.113
Here!

01:11:58.766 --> 01:11:59.993
Tell me, Behmen ...

01:12:01.808 --> 01:12:06.466
Are We going in there to defeat the demon
or to save the girl?

01:12:08.608 --> 01:12:09.682
Both.

01:12:17.526 --> 01:12:19.118
I have found more holly water.

01:12:19.808 --> 01:12:21.246
You've done well.

01:12:23.684 --> 01:12:26.841
- This as far as you go, Kay.
- I do not understand ...

01:12:27.466 --> 01:12:28.988
This is not your battle.

01:12:29.403 --> 01:12:32.410
I took a vow
to join your cause.

01:12:32.779 --> 01:12:36.280
I Release you from your vow
There's no shame in it.

01:12:37.818 --> 01:12:41.779
Honour is not as thing to be dismissed or forgotten.

01:12:42.684 --> 01:12:45.991
A vow must be fulfilled ,
else, there is no vow at all.

01:12:46.485 --> 01:12:49.551
- Even are the cost of your life?
- Even then.

01:12:59.891 --> 01:13:01.467
Kneel, Kay.

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:05.871
Speak after me.

01:13:06.498 --> 01:13:09.732
- Grant me courage Lord ...
- Grant me courage Lord ...

01:13:10.746 --> 01:13:14.084
- For I'm thy servant.
- For I'm thy servant.

01:13:15.563 --> 01:13:19.624
- And guard me with strength into battle...
- And guard me with strength into battle...

01:13:19.873 --> 01:13:22.718
- That I may destroy thin enemies ...
- That I may destroy thin enemies ...

01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:28.029
- As dust before the wind.
- As dust before the wind.

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:31.767
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:13:32.063 --> 01:13:33.269
Amen.

01:13:36.574 --> 01:13:38.689
Rise a knight.

01:13:48.834 --> 01:13:52.563
- Felson.
- What is it?

01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:56.051
I know in my heart,
I haven't earned this.

01:14:00.611 --> 01:14:02.672
You will ....

01:14:14.035 --> 01:14:15.991
The Demon could've escaped
any time.

01:14:16.349 --> 01:14:18.370
Why did it wait until we reach Severak?

01:14:18.405 --> 01:14:20.391
Perhaps escape
wasn't its purpose.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.427
It wants to be here.

01:14:24.113 --> 01:14:27.038
Debelzaq, You said Eckhart tried to free her.

01:14:27.564 --> 01:14:29.141
<I>and I will not be a part of this..

01:14:29.345 --> 01:14:30.424
<I> - Father!
- Mila?

01:14:31.917 --> 01:14:35.940
and it killed him, and Hagamar too.
He stood in its way.

01:14:37.002 --> 01:14:39.414
<I> We kill the bitch!
Here and now, be done with it

01:14:43.347 --> 01:14:45.987
It wanted to come here
from the very beginning.

01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:48.020
My God!

01:14:48.711 --> 01:14:50.379
<I>The sooner we get her to
Severak, the better.

01:14:50.414 --> 01:14:53.006
He's right. Everything it's done,
has led us here.

01:15:15.103 --> 01:15:16.617
Over Here.

01:15:31.165 --> 01:15:33.571
Why would a dying monk do this to himself?!

01:15:34.195 --> 01:15:36.150
Why would he tie himself to a desk?

01:15:37.302 --> 01:15:39.006
It's a passage from
Book of Solomon.

01:15:52.303 --> 01:15:53.667
Have more over here

01:15:59.427 --> 01:16:00.740
And more.

01:16:12.171 --> 01:16:13.286
They were Copying it.

01:16:14.414 --> 01:16:17.082
To spread the wisdom of Solomon
to all the corners of the earth

01:16:17.117 --> 01:16:19.081
that might beyond
and much better than that  .

01:16:22.485 --> 01:16:23.609
It wants the book!

01:16:25.734 --> 01:16:28.787
That why the demon deceived us into believe in
the girl was witch.

01:16:30.069 --> 01:16:33.750
It knew that a witch will be brought to those
who possess the Book of Solomon.

01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:37.485
You've seen what this plague has done ...

01:16:38.734 --> 01:16:41.298
If the book would've fall
into the demon's hands,

01:16:41.581 --> 01:16:44.862
We would face an endless darkness.

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:47.913
It's our last defence.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.360
I thank all of you.

01:16:56.676 --> 01:17:00.677
You sacrificed so much
to deliver me here

01:17:01.268 --> 01:17:04.377
And now you've brought me the book.

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:10.196
Debelzaq ...

01:17:10.197 --> 01:17:11.197
{Latin Hymns & prayers}

01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:17.425
Silence!

01:17:19.299 --> 01:17:20.769
- Watch out!
- Behmen!

01:17:40.331 --> 01:17:41.332
Where are they?!

01:17:42.115 --> 01:17:44.962
- Who?
- The Monks?

01:17:52.008 --> 01:17:54.466
You can weaken it!
you have to keep reading.

01:18:41.101 --> 01:18:43.213
The head ...
Cut off their heads!

01:19:10.042 --> 01:19:11.718
They're like cockroaches.

01:21:03.063 --> 01:21:07.001
You have no idea how bad cause of book
Cause to me till over the centuries

01:21:08.765 --> 01:21:11.874
I destroyed the others.
This is the last one.

01:21:21.785 --> 01:21:23.969
you'll be buying tonight my friend.

01:21:58.336 --> 01:21:59.941
Felson!

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:22.910
Finish it!

01:23:50.137 --> 01:23:51.291
Behmen ...

01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.482
What can I do?

01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:09.721
Keep her safe.

01:24:55.159 --> 01:24:57.032
God be with you, Felson.

01:25:07.266 --> 01:25:08.576
It's strange ...

01:25:11.219 --> 01:25:14.090
To owe so much
to someone I've never even knew.

01:25:16.279 --> 01:25:18.014
I do not know what to say.

01:25:20.446 --> 01:25:22.595
Say what is within your heart.

01:25:27.272 --> 01:25:29.233
My name is Anna.

01:25:31.452 --> 01:25:33.076
I owe you my life.

01:25:35.128 --> 01:25:36.702
God keep you.

01:25:57.534 --> 01:25:59.852
will you tell me about them?

01:26:00.794 --> 01:26:02.611
I want to know them.

01:26:18.927 --> 01:26:22.423
<I>So the plague past
and life returned to the land

01:26:23.806 --> 01:26:28.003
<I> There are Many who Say the plague was nothing
but a pestilence that finally broke,

01:26:28.789 --> 01:26:31.078
<I> Like the passing of a fever.

01:26:31.892 --> 01:26:35.142
<I> They do not know the darkness
that almost was.

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:38.063
<I> The sacrifices made ...

01:26:38.517 --> 01:26:40.365
<I> The heroes lost ...

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.695
<I> I'll tell their story.

01:26:44.269 --> 01:26:47.360
<I> I was there.
I know.
