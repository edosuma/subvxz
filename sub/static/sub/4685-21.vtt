have anything you've

09:47.212 --> 09:49.965
ever been afraid of?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.196
Being seen in last

09:51.197 --> 09:52.301
season's accessories.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.866
Okay, I wish I had

09:54.867 --> 09:56.847
your problems.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.349
- How did you
- get over your fear?

09:58.474 --> 10:00.392
I faced it.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.311
I put on a scarf

10:02.312 --> 10:03.937
that was so hideous,

10:04.062 --> 10:06.023
so last spring,

10:06.148 --> 10:07.983
- and I looked
- in the mirror, and I said,

10:08.108 --> 10:09.776
- "Scarfie,
- you don't scare me!"

10:14.239 --> 10:15.345
You are an

10:15.346 --> 10:16.450
American hero.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.787
Jessie, are you

10:19.788 --> 10:21.413
afraid of anything?

10:21.539 --> 10:22.686
Well, there is

10:22.687 --> 10:23.832
this one thing.

10:21.539 --> 10:23.832
But it's silly.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.168
Let's hear it.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.461
Fine.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.006
- It all started
- three years ago,

10:31.131 --> 10:32.550
After a 72-ounce

10:32.551 --> 10:33.967
Bladder Buster

10:31.131 --> 10:33.967
of cherry cola.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.413
I was at the circus,

10:41.414 --> 10:43.018
and I had to go

10:39.806 --> 10:43.018
to the bathroom.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.377
While I was in there,

10:47.378 --> 10:49.441
one of the handlers tied

10:45.312 --> 10:49.441
an elephant to the door.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.153
Really?

10:55.364 --> 10:56.865
(ELEPHANT TRUMPETING)

10:58.450 --> 11:00.202
Hey! Occupado, buddy!

11:00.869 --> 11:03.310
Then, some rotten kid

11:03.311 --> 11:05.749
walked by with peanuts.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.491
The kid took off,

11:17.492 --> 11:18.762
the elephant went after him,

11:18.845 --> 11:20.118
and I got dragged

11:20.119 --> 11:21.390
through the Big Top,

11:21.515 --> 11:23.142
taking out a tiny car

11:23.143 --> 11:24.768
with 17 clowns in it,

11:24.893 --> 11:26.853
- and a family of
- Romanian acrobats.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.210
Luckily,

11:28.211 --> 11:29.440
I don't speak Romanian.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.877
- When the elephant - finally stopped,
- I opened the door

11:32.901 --> 11:34.361
And found myself

11:34.362 --> 11:35.820
in the lions' den.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.706
- Suddenly, it was too
- late for a bathroom!

11:40.242 --> 11:41.535
So your fear is elephants?

11:41.536 --> 11:42.827
Lions?

11:42.953 --> 11:44.392
Extremely flexible

11:58.260 --> 11:59.783
This isn't about me!

11:59.784 --> 12:01.305
This is about Zuri.

12:01.972 --> 12:03.391
I'll stay with you tonight

12:03.392 --> 12:04.808
until you fall asleep,

12:04.933 --> 12:06.411
- and when you wake up
- in the morning,

12:06.435 --> 12:07.787
- You'll realize there was
- nothing to be afraid of.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.939
And if you wake up dead,

12:11.064 --> 12:12.816
- surrounded by
- blood-spattered dolls,

12:12.941 --> 12:14.109
I'll tell Jessie

(SCREAMING)

12:23.327 --> 12:25.120
Hi, again.

12:25.121 --> 12:26.913
I was here earlier

12:23.327 --> 12:26.913
with my brother.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.937
I remember.

12:28.938 --> 12:30.834
Walks funny,

12:27.038 --> 12:30.834
smells like cornstarch?

12:32.377 --> 12:33.545
That's him.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.090
Oh. Did you know

12:37.215 --> 12:38.947
that my brother

12:38.948 --> 12:40.678
has a giant Asian

12:37.215 --> 12:40.678
water monitor for a pet?

12:40.844 --> 12:42.346
I love lizards.

12:42.347 --> 12:43.847
They're so cute.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.266
Almost as cute as you.

12:48.519 --> 12:49.519
Oh.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.481
Thanks.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.588
But the guy you should

12:55.589 --> 12:56.985
be talking to is Ravi.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.717
He has great manners

12:58.718 --> 13:00.322
and a heck of a vocabulary.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.033
Does he have freckles?

13:03.158 --> 13:05.494
I love freckles.

13:07.037 --> 13:10.708
You traitorous swine!

13:10.874 --> 13:12.084
No, no! Ravi, dude,

13:12.085 --> 13:13.293
you don't understand!

13:13.418 --> 13:15.754
Do not I just!

13:17.422 --> 13:18.733
- I take five extra
- minutes to shop

13:18.757 --> 13:20.197
For a reasonably

13:20.198 --> 13:21.635
priced bouquet,

13:21.760 --> 13:23.033
and you move in

13:23.034 --> 13:24.304

13:24.429 --> 13:25.699
- No! I was helping you.

13:25.723 --> 13:26.745

about Kipling...

13:29.309 --> 13:31.019
Thank you.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.872
- No, no, Ravi, dude,
- you've got it all wrong!

13:32.896 --> 13:34.418
You have been

13:34.419 --> 13:35.940
challenged to a duel.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.402
We will settle this

13:38.403 --> 13:40.738
on the field of honor,

13:36.066 --> 13:40.738
tomorrow at dawn.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.298
- I don't know what
- you're talking about.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.907
- But I don't do
- anything at dawn!

13:44.908 --> 13:47.515
Fine. Just be back

13:47.516 --> 13:50.121
here in two hours!

13:53.584 --> 13:55.649
I can't believe

13:55.650 --> 13:57.713
two guys are actually

13:53.584 --> 13:57.713
gonna duel over me.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.110
I finally have

13:59.111 --> 14:00.298
something to blog!

14:06.054 --> 14:07.577
Okay, Emma,

14:07.578 --> 14:09.099
I'm putting you

14:06.054 --> 14:09.099
in charge of the duel.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.309
I need to monitor

14:10.310 --> 14:11.393
the radio contest.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.395
(SINGING OPERA MUSIC)

14:17.941 --> 14:19.861
- Gee, and I thought
- this was going to be lame.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.136
Luke, where is

14:25.137 --> 14:26.825
your uniform?

14:26.950 --> 14:28.598
This is a duel,

14:28.599 --> 14:30.245
take it seriously!

14:30.370 --> 14:32.060
How can I take it

14:32.061 --> 14:33.749
seriously when you're

14:30.370 --> 14:33.749
wearing pantaloons?

14:33.957 --> 14:35.855
Why would you

14:35.856 --> 14:37.753
not want to wear

14:33.957 --> 14:37.753
the proper attire?

14:37.961 --> 14:38.962
Because some of us

14:38.963 --> 14:39.963
don't want to die alone.

14:41.799 --> 14:43.218
Ravi, can we please

14:43.219 --> 14:44.635
just drop this?

14:44.760 --> 14:47.971
No! I demand satisfaction.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.765
- You attempted
- to steal my girl.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.204
I did not!

14:51.205 --> 14:52.434
Before you told me,

14:52.559 --> 14:54.352
- I didn't even
- know she was a girl.

14:55.186 --> 14:56.227
Choose your weapon, knave.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.862
They're fighting over me!

It's just like when

15:05.156 --> 15:06.323

turn and fire!

- So? What are you
- gonna do about it?

up to your fears.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.767
- I'll spend the night
- with my dolls,

16:15.893 --> 16:17.478
If you spend

16:17.479 --> 16:19.062
the night in this.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.337
No way!

16:22.338 --> 16:23.400

get that thing up here?

16:36.248 --> 16:37.706
going to take to help you

16:34.786 --> 16:37.706
get over your fear of dolls?

16:37.831 --> 16:40.334
Yep.

16:40.335 --> 16:42.836
And you've gotta stay

16:37.831 --> 16:42.836

Whoa! She is one

18:17.681 --> 18:19.016
So it would appear.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.242
- Yeah.
- And just for the record,

18:20.266 --> 18:21.977
I did not hug Tanya.

18:21.978 --> 18:23.687
She hugged me.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.939
Is this true?

18:26.064 --> 18:27.462
Yeah! I mean,

18:27.463 --> 18:28.859
look at him.

18:26.064 --> 18:28.859
He's a babe.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.987
Guilty as charged.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.303
Tanya, I thought you were

18:36.304 --> 18:38.409
like a winsome tree frog,

18:38.535 --> 18:40.391
but now I see you are

18:40.392 --> 18:42.246
a poisonous toad.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.832
That's an insult to toads.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.417
And poison.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.087
Text me.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.384
Luke, I am sorry

18:53.385 --> 18:54.843
I did not believe you.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.032
I was beguiled

18:56.033 --> 18:57.095
by Tanya's beauty.

18:59.931 --> 19:00.931
Still not seeing it.

19:01.725 --> 19:04.895

On the bright side,

19:11.549 --> 19:12.986
it'll be a really

Wait!

And get myself a cat.

19:24.247 --> 19:25.874
- It's going to be
- the first of many.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.532
I can't stand this.

19:38.533 --> 19:39.804
I gotta get out of here.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.476
Who are you?

19:45.602 --> 19:47.667
Pagliacci, the famous

19:47.668 --> 19:49.731
singing clown.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.983
(SINGING OPERA MUSIC)

19:54.277 --> 19:55.946
- What?
- I don't speak opera!

19:58.448 --> 20:00.596
I'm here to help you

20:00.597 --> 20:02.744
overcome your fear.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.370
See, that one I got.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.582
Good. Take these.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.626
- For what?
- That!

20:09.751 --> 20:11.128
(GROWLING)

20:12.796 --> 20:13.964
Yikes!

20:16.758 --> 20:18.051
(WHIP CRACKS)

20:18.052 --> 20:19.343
Back! Back!

20:19.469 --> 20:21.179
Back! Back!

20:23.473 --> 20:25.016
(LAUGHS) Good job!

20:26.392 --> 20:28.352
Not so scary now, are ya?

20:28.853 --> 20:31.002
Now come on.

20:31.003 --> 20:33.150
Let's head over

20:28.853 --> 20:33.150
to Zuri's dream.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.859
- Need to use
- the potty first?

20:34.985 --> 20:36.527
(CHUCKLES) I kid! I kid!

20:38.947 --> 20:40.156
Dolls.

20:40.157 --> 20:41.365
Scary dolls!

20:45.411 --> 20:47.038
(SCREAMS)

20:47.872 --> 20:48.873
You don't have to

20:48.874 --> 20:49.874
be afraid of us, Zuri.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.543
Not all dolls are

20:51.544 --> 20:53.086
scary and evil.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.948
- Okay, that one
- is a little scary.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.016
What about them?

21:06.141 --> 21:07.643
If you don't think

21:07.644 --> 21:09.144
that's scary,

21:06.141 --> 21:09.144
you have oatmeal for brains!

21:12.814 --> 21:14.858
Zuri, these are your dolls.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.734
- I thought you ran
- this tea party.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.153
I do.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.161
- So are you gonna
- let them push you around?

21:20.197 --> 21:21.949
Heck to the no!

21:21.950 --> 21:23.700
I ain't scared of no dolls!

21:23.825 --> 21:25.598
Get your raggedy butt

21:25.599 --> 21:27.370
out of here!

21:28.454 --> 21:30.498
That goes for all of you!

21:34.252 --> 21:35.441
What about me?

21:35.442 --> 21:36.629
I'm the nice doll.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.569
Sorry! I'm not

21:38.570 --> 21:40.383
taking any chances!

21:52.187 --> 21:55.023
Jessie! It's morning!

21:55.148 --> 21:56.962
We did it!

21:56.963 --> 21:58.776
We made it

21:55.148 --> 21:58.776
through the night!

21:58.902 --> 22:00.778
Oh! Oh, we sure did!

22:00.904 --> 22:02.573
I can't believe

22:02.574 --> 22:04.241
I spent the night

22:00.904 --> 22:04.241
in a port-a-potty.

22:04.407 --> 22:05.616
You actually said it.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.494
Hooray, we both

22:07.495 --> 22:09.246
conquered our fears!

22:09.412 --> 22:10.872
Now I can go anywhere.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.499
And by go anywhere,

22:12.500 --> 22:14.000
I mean go anywhere!

22:14.125 --> 22:15.377
Construction sites,

22:15.378 --> 22:16.627
Renaissance fairs,

22:16.753 --> 22:18.353
- anything with
- "palooza" in the title.

22:20.215 --> 22:22.092
- The world
- is your outhouse.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.970
By the way,

22:24.971 --> 22:27.097
did you have any

22:22.842 --> 22:27.097
weird dreams last night?

22:27.222 --> 22:28.828
Sure did,

22:28.829 --> 22:30.433
but don't worry.

22:27.222 --> 22:30.433
They're just dreams.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.102
Nothing to be afraid of.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.692
Great. Tony's guy

22:39.693 --> 22:40.860
is double parked.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.320
So, let's get

22:42.321 --> 22:43.654
this bad boy

22:40.985 --> 22:43.654
down to the lobby.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.156
- Right, ready?
- Yup.

22:45.282 --> 22:46.783
And push!

22:46.908 --> 22:48.868
(ALL GRUNTING)

22:49.994 --> 22:51.476
This potty is

22:51.477 --> 22:52.956
surprisingly unportable.

22:54.332 --> 22:55.541
Where are we going?

22:57.460 --> 22:58.461
