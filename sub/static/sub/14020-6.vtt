In the criminal justice system

00:03.570 --> 00:07.279
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:07.508 --> 00:09.215
the police
who investigate crime

00:09.443 --> 00:11.923
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:12.312 --> 00:13.552
These are their stories.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.525
This guy was camped out here,
wouldn't me park.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.828
I'm reserving this space
for a friend.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.927
This Neanderthal
tried to run me over.

00:21.989 --> 00:25.027
This isn't the Four Seasons. You
can't reserve a space, sir.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.366
I should have run over
this little twerp.

00:26.426 --> 00:27.496
All right. Take it easy.
Bring it on.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.938
Hey, settle down!

got a wedding ring and a purse.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.961
Leather's torn near the strap. BRISCOE:
She played tug of war with the shooter.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.531
He missed out. Couple hundred
bucks in fresh twenties.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.166
That's worth dying for.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.234
Eva Harrison. Let's try
to find her husband.

01:07.668 --> 01:11.411
Got two witnesses. Shooter was a
Hispanic kid on a silver mountain bike.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.348
Every unit in the sector's
looking for him.

01:14.441 --> 01:17.217
Daytime stick-up. Haven't
seen one of those in a while.

01:17.644 --> 01:19.885
Yeah. A real
blast from the past.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.800
He rode by me
before the shooting.

02:12.866 --> 02:16.143
It was a silver Cobra, the 812 model.
It just came out this year.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.476
And then what happened?

02:17.537 --> 02:20.017
I just heard shots and turned around.
Which way did he go?

02:20.874 --> 02:23.013
He burned a right
on 105th.

02:23.276 --> 02:26.746
That's a fast bike. Titanium
frame, XTR derailleurs.

02:26.847 --> 02:27.848
Yeah, what about the guy?

02:28.181 --> 02:31.219
I don't know, light-skinned.
Spanish, I think.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.552
What about his clothes?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.395
I don't know.
Something dark.

02:36.289 --> 02:38.235
But his bike had
the flake paint job.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.459
Again the bike?

02:40.060 --> 02:43.439
Hey, look, the guy rode by
me on an $800 mountain bike.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.541
I didn't know he was
gonna kill somebody.

02:46.533 --> 02:47.534
Thanks.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.848
I heard the gun go off and
I saw the guy riding away.

02:50.937 --> 02:53.110
Which direction?
Umm...

02:54.141 --> 02:56.712
Left on 105th Another
witness said right.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.415
Well, I didn't want
to look at him too close.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.423
Did you see what
color hair he had?

03:01.481 --> 03:02.687
I couldn't tell.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.686
I'm pretty sure
he was wearing a hat.

03:04.885 --> 03:05.920
Pretty sure?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.829
Well, you want me
to be accurate, right?

03:07.954 --> 03:09.797
We'd like one answer
with no maybes.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.134
I saw him from the back.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.996
Why don't you talk to the blonde couple.
They were a lot closer.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.437
Where's this
blonde couple now?

03:17.898 --> 03:21.107
WOMAN: We hear the shots, we run.
We don't know where he goes.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.614
He had a... What is the word?
Beard?

03:23.670 --> 03:25.445
BRISCOE: You mean mustache?
No, Heinrich,

03:25.505 --> 03:27.075
he had a empty face,
he had nothing.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.813
How can you say this?
Did he have a hat?

03:29.009 --> 03:30.010
Yes.
No.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.282
He had a black hat.
That was his hair.

03:32.612 --> 03:33.750
All right.
What was he wearing?

03:34.014 --> 03:36.494
A blue shirt.
No, his shirt was black.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.158
His hair was black
His shirt was blue.

03:39.352 --> 03:40.524
No wonder
they needed a wall.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.658
Detective,
we located the husband.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.802
BRISCOE: Nobody got
a real good look.

03:47.427 --> 03:48.428
Then how are you
going to find him?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.173
That's why we wanted
to talk to you.

03:57.003 --> 04:00.382
Do you remember if your wife's pocket-book
was torn before this happened?

04:00.841 --> 04:03.082
I never paid much attention
to her pocket-books, why?

04:03.443 --> 04:05.286
It looks like it might
have been a purse-snatching.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.018
PETER: Eva never carried
around much money.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.858
ED: We found
$250 in her purse.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.251
You did?

04:11.551 --> 04:13.462
You live on 68th Street.

04:13.653 --> 04:17.123
Now, what would she be doing way
up at Manhattan Avenue and 104th?

04:17.624 --> 04:19.160
Nothing that would
get her killed.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.804
She taught art at the
Morningside Community Center.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.799
She ever talk about
her students?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.968
Yes. They liked art.

04:31.404 --> 04:34.442
She was murdered
in broad daylight

04:34.508 --> 04:38.012
with a cop right there, and you
don't have any idea who did this?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.757
Not at the moment.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.121
We'll get the guy.

04:41.815 --> 04:45.820
I hope so.
I have to call my family.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.733
Standard procedure. His wife's
dead, he's taking it out on us.

04:52.793 --> 04:57.264
The Borough Commander wants to know how
15 units in hot pursuit missed this guy.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.334
Maybe he should be calling
Patrol, not Detective Squad.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.244
Maybe the Detective Squad should
be getting him off my back.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.152
NURSE:
These are Eva's students.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.893

all of them.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.155

her class over?

05:17.651 --> 05:21.030
It was supposed to be at 11:00,
but she stayed till 12:00.

05:22.122 --> 05:25.660
Her students love her I don't
know how I'm gonna tell them.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.170
Any idea where she
went when she left?

05:28.261 --> 05:30.605
The ATM at the bank
on Manhattan Avenue.

05:31.431 --> 05:34.844
She was leaving money for me for
supplies, out of her own pocket.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.106
She was supposed to
come right back.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.505
BRISCOE: Thanks.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.942
She got followed
from the bank.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.622
The bank's only two blocks
from the Douglas projects.

a kid on an $800 bike.

looking for is a light-skinned Hispanic.

might be a smart move to ditch it.

but nobody matching the perp.

And we did get a .25 slug from the
M.E., if we can find the gun.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.262
So, all you have is a bike that might
have been ridden by the shooter?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.763
This case is harder
than it looked.

11:58.017 --> 12:00.361
Look, he borrowed my car,
that's all.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.831
(PHONE RINGING)

12:03.223 --> 12:04.224
Hello?

12:05.558 --> 12:08.402
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

12:15.535 --> 12:17.879
(CONTINUES SPEAKING SPANISH)

12:21.741 --> 12:23.084
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

12:24.944 --> 12:27.117
Victor took her car
and a hundred bucks.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.827
Star 69.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.052
He could have asked first.

12:33.553 --> 12:36.227
What do you want, a quarter?
Where am I calling, please?

12:36.789 --> 12:38.860
No, this isn't a joke.
This is police business.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.260
Thank you.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.340
Phone booth outside a Port
Authority bus terminal.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.106
MAN: (ON PA)
Now boarding platform 24.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.510
Philadelphia local,
stopping at Newark...

13:06.185 --> 13:07.789
Hands on the wall, Bobby!

13:08.187 --> 13:10.030
Okay, let me finish.
Now!

13:10.456 --> 13:12.561
Just a second.
Let me see your hands!

13:12.992 --> 13:15.768
Relax, man.
I said show me your hands!

13:15.962 --> 13:18.340
Oh, is that what you wanna
see, you old maricón?

13:18.831 --> 13:20.606
Zip it up, Sabo.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.907
You're under arrest.
Ah, you're lucky he showed up.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.811
You're lucky
I didn't shoot it off.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.751
You're a tough guy, right? Is
that your boyfriend? Shut up!

13:35.381 --> 13:36.382
No weapon.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.134
ED: We got your bike, Bobby.
Your prints are all over it.

13:43.790 --> 13:44.996
Witnesses are on the way.

13:46.125 --> 13:49.663
You know, once we write this up as
murder one, there's no turning back.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.373
You think I'm scared?
ED: You should be.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.902
She wouldn't give it up,
would she, Bobby?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.815
Pissed you off, huh? This
white lady fighting back?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.712
What'd I shoot her with,
my finger?

14:02.108 --> 14:04.816
Know what? You got kind
of an old man smell.

14:05.044 --> 14:08.287
You know, Lennie, I think he
was just trying to scare her.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.283
Is that right, Bobby?

14:10.950 --> 14:14.762
You let him watch your back? Man, I
went by him like he was my grandma.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.032
Get the line-up ready, Ed. Let's
see him get by the eyewitnesses.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.448
I'm not sure.
BRISCOE: Take your time.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.953
Uh-uh. No do-overs.
She already whiffed.

14:37.009 --> 14:41.185
I'm sorry. I told you this would be a
waste of time. Thanks, Ms. Palmer.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.593
Makes you 0-for-2.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.225
What about
the German couple?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.797
Back home in Stuttgart.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.889
Well, then my client's
going home, too.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.168
Can't we hold him on something?
Resisting arrest?

14:57.397 --> 14:58.842
Or flashing?

14:59.132 --> 15:01.908
I'm not bringing this to the D.A.
What's plan B?

15:02.769 --> 15:04.612
Maybe we rattle
the cousin's cage.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.672
See what shakes loose.
VAN BUREN: That's it?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.409
Hey, don't worry. We got
enough to turn this guy.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.122
Victor Sabo?

15:14.313 --> 15:17.260
Leave us alone already. I just want
to talk to your boyfriend here.

15:17.316 --> 15:19.262
Yeah? What for?
Come on, let's take a walk.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.797
Look, man, Bobby told me
he was the clear, all right?

15:22.989 --> 15:25.196
And you believed him? You're
an accessory to murder.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.762
Oh, whoa. Wait, you can't keep
him so you're coming after me?

15:28.361 --> 15:31.308
You picked up his bag. You gave
him a ride to the bus station.

15:31.964 --> 15:34.968
Look, man, he said he needed some clothes.
I don't know nothing about no murder.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.674
What'd he do with his gun?
I don't know about no gun.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.115
You do know where you picked him up.
Before you got his bag.

15:40.306 --> 15:43.150
You know what, I ain't sayin' nothing,
so you might as well arrest me.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.983
Look, man, I can respect
that he's your cousin,

15:45.044 --> 15:47.923
but if you want to worry about your
family worry about your grandmother.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.549
What's she
got to do with this?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.486
You want her to lose her apartment
because you're acting stupid?

15:54.153 --> 15:55.598
It's no big deal. You're not
gonna be able to help her.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.032
We're gonna charge you.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.325
Man, I didn't do nothin'.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.970
We gave you a shot, Victor.
This accessory deal's legit.

16:04.964 --> 16:05.965
All right.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.305
Look, he was staying with some
guy named Diego in the Bronx.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.674
They were together in Rikers.

16:19.011 --> 16:21.287
Yeah. I was on the rock
with Bobby for eight months.

16:21.981 --> 16:22.982
I'm trying to
get away from that.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.193
Then why did you let
Bobby stay here?

16:26.119 --> 16:28.565
It's hard to say no. Me and him,
you know, we been through a lot.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.767
He tell you he was
running from a murder rap?

16:31.657 --> 16:34.536
I figured it was something serious.
He had a gun.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.130
I didn't know.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.734
You want to think about
that some more?

16:41.267 --> 16:43.508
BRISCOE: What do you think your
parole officer is going to say

16:43.569 --> 16:46.914
when we tell him you opened a
rooming house for armed fugitives?

16:49.876 --> 16:51.321
All right. Yeah.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.384
He had a burner. I made
him take it out of here.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.527
He didn't have it with him
at the Port Authority.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.020
Well, I told him he was
stupid to be carrying it.

17:00.119 --> 17:02.463
Maybe he ditched it between
here and the bus station.

17:02.588 --> 17:03.589
The Taurus.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.766
Hey, don't put your shoes on my seat.
Back seat's clean.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.275
You satisfied now?

17:12.698 --> 17:14.540
You like Pizza Land?
What do you care?

17:15.300 --> 17:17.906
Well, maybe you want
to eat what's in bag.

17:18.905 --> 17:19.906
.25.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.444
That stupid Bobby,
I'm gonna kill him.

17:24.109 --> 17:25.180
Be our guest.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.587
(PLAYERS CHATTERING)

17:32.919 --> 17:36.196
Nowhere to go, Bobby. Man, I
beat this stinkin' case already.

17:36.455 --> 17:39.368
Hey, you try to go over that fence,
I'm gonna have to stop you with this.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.631
See, fellas, all these cops
wanna do is take me out.

17:43.262 --> 17:45.208
ED: All right, let's go! What you lookin' at?
Get on the fence!

17:45.298 --> 17:46.777
OFFICER: Put your hands up on the fence.
Let's go! Now!

17:46.833 --> 17:48.870
Toss 'em for weapons If
they're clean, send 'em home.

17:49.836 --> 17:50.871
Don't move!

17:50.937 --> 17:51.938
We all set, Lennie?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.745
Yeah, we're all set.
Our boy here just confessed.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.821
If you keep harassing my client like
this, we'll get a restraining order.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.830
Save it, Counselor.
We found his .25.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.233
Now, that ain't mine.
Take it easy, Bobby.

18:09.288 --> 18:12.360
It doesn't matter whose gun it is.
Your client confessed.

18:12.491 --> 18:15.062
Confessed to what?
To murder and robbery.

18:15.561 --> 18:17.370
I don't know
what he's talking about.

18:17.496 --> 18:20.773
I'm talking about what you
said on the basketball court.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.972
About giving the lady
what she deserved.

18:23.035 --> 18:26.278
I didn't say nothin' about no lady.
Look he's tryin' to frame me.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.784
Now why would he do that?

18:27.974 --> 18:30.420
'Cause I burned their asses
two times already.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.955
Yeah. Now we got yours
nailed to the wall.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.213
Yeah, right.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.193
Yo, you got a dirty cop
in your house.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.159
You said it,
you son of a bitch!

18:38.451 --> 18:39.862
Gonna put a beat-down
on me now?

18:40.086 --> 18:42.066
Any witnesses to this
so-called confession?

18:43.189 --> 18:45.226
I'm gonna finish
writing my report.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.469
You just gonna stand there
and let this cracker frame me?

18:53.833 --> 18:54.834
Shut up.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.651
Did you hear this confession?
No.

19:04.610 --> 19:05.611
Hmm.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.853
You want to look over this
DD-5 before I file it? Sure.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.329
Lucky he 'fessed up.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.562
Yep, lucky.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.363
How'd you get it
out of him so quick?

19:22.061 --> 19:23.062
What's that mean?

19:23.596 --> 19:25.405
I'm just saying,
it's pretty amazing.

19:25.464 --> 19:27.603
You're alone with the guy for
10 seconds and he gives it up.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.368
You don't believe
it happened?

19:30.102 --> 19:31.638
Hey, I'm just asking how.

19:33.039 --> 19:35.076
I've been doing this
for 25 years.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.382
I think I've earned the right
not to be second-guessed.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.015
We are charging Sabo
with the murder?

19:40.212 --> 19:42.283
Let's see what ballistics
says about his gun.

19:48.454 --> 19:49.455
(sun FIRES)

19:50.256 --> 19:54.864
All right. You got a Raven Arms MP-25.
Recently fired.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.536
Four rounds in the clip.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.569
Now then, Ravens

20:02.201 --> 20:06.775
have got five lands and
grooves, with a right twist.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.450
Same as the slug
from your victim.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.545
All right.

20:15.247 --> 20:18.285
You got a live perp on this? Yeah. Now
all we need is a little evidence.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.230
Take a look.

20:24.323 --> 20:26.269
The striations on the slugs
don't match.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.565
Mmm-hmm.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.430
That's not your
murder weapon, guys.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.337
At least you got him
on gun possession.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.001
(SIGHS)

20:37.570 --> 20:39.379
VAN BUREN:
Sabo's the shooter.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.179
So why'd the judge
let him walk?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.810
Talk to the judge.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.479
I don't have to.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.420
You only charged him
with possession.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.288
The gun didn't match.

20:48.514 --> 20:51.723
Your problem isn't with
the gun or with the judge.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.257
You just can't
put together a case.

20:54.353 --> 20:55.593
It's taking time.

20:55.654 --> 20:56.997
Time for what?

20:57.056 --> 21:00.799
This woman was gunned down on a
busy street, for God's sakes.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.965
Where are the eyewitnesses?

21:04.029 --> 21:06.475
We found two.
They couldn't make ID's.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.671
We still have
the guy's confession.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.611
You have a confession?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.445
Well, do you or don't you?

21:15.508 --> 21:16.680
The guy said he did it.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.349
What's the problem?

21:19.412 --> 21:22.222
Nobody heard it
except Detective Briscoe.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.827
So? You don't believe him?

21:23.916 --> 21:25.418
VAN BUREN:
We need corroboration.

21:25.484 --> 21:26.724
We have other leads...

21:26.786 --> 21:28.163
I wanna to see
your write-up.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.893
I'll make sure you
get the write-up.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.965
You know anything
about this confession?

21:33.025 --> 21:34.902
VAN BUREN:
Will you excuse us?

21:37.797 --> 21:38.901
(DOOR OPENING)

21:41.200 --> 21:42.304
(DOOR CLOSING)

21:42.368 --> 21:44.473
Forget corroboration.
Just make the arrest.

21:44.537 --> 21:45.572
It won't stick.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.016
Let the D.A. worry about that.
They can take the heat.

21:48.073 --> 21:49.552
I won't work
a case that way.

21:49.608 --> 21:52.350
I don't see you
working this case at all.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.556
Your own detectives
are lying to you.

21:54.613 --> 21:57.856
Detective Briscoe said
the suspect confessed,

21:57.950 --> 21:59.520
then that's the way
it happened.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.496
Sabo is the guy.

22:02.621 --> 22:04.396
You better be right.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.593
Especially about Briscoe.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.976
Thanks for all your
wonderful support in there.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.238
I don't want to
hear it, Lennie.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.506
Do we have other leads?

22:15.568 --> 22:16.808
Well, to tell you the truth...
You know what?

22:17.503 --> 22:19.380
Why don't we
shake this up a little bit?

22:19.472 --> 22:21.110
Lennie, you can work
the phones with Sanders

22:21.173 --> 22:23.312
and you and LaMotte can look
for the murder weapon.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.252
Hey, nothing against LaMotte,

22:25.344 --> 22:27.017
but Lennie and me
is not the problem.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.353
You sure?

22:29.849 --> 22:32.193
Because I'm not
doing that again.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.233
Don't do me any favors.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.228
I'm not.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.863
LaMotte's working a ten by six. I
don't need a double shift tonight.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.674
Yeah, nobody's calling you
a liar.

22:44.730 --> 22:45.834
I never called you
a liar.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.640
The hell you didn't. What was all
that back in the squad room?

22:48.968 --> 22:51.642
You got it wrong, Lennie.
I'm not the enemy here.

22:51.804 --> 22:52.908
Yeah?

22:53.639 --> 22:55.676
I don't know what you are.

23:00.446 --> 23:01.618
Joey.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.024
What time you going?

23:05.551 --> 23:06.757
Sounds good.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.026
Pick me up at
the usual spot.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.597
I'm out of here.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.875
Can't say I'm surprised.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.410
What, you got something
better to do?

23:20.466 --> 23:23.276
Bobby's gun was found
in a Pizza Land bag.

23:23.736 --> 23:24.840
Yeah?

23:24.904 --> 23:27.908
Well, there's 12 Pizza Lands
in Manhattan

23:27.973 --> 23:29.145
open till midnight.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.162
(SLAMMING)

23:44.223 --> 23:46.464
This pizza better taste right.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.133
BRISCOE:
His name's Bobby Sabo.

23:52.197 --> 23:53.835
Maybe he's been
in here recently?

23:53.899 --> 23:55.037
This is the guy.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.169
What guy?

23:56.235 --> 23:58.306
The guy doing business
in our bathroom.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.281
Why don't you tell us
what you're talking about?

24:00.673 --> 24:02.118
Monday night.

24:02.174 --> 24:05.849
I go in there to wash my hands,
you know, like the sign says,

24:05.911 --> 24:07.822
and, uh, I see this guy
in there with Roger.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.120
BRISCOE:
Yeah, what were they doing?

24:09.181 --> 24:11.058
Looked like they were making
some kind of deal or something.

24:11.584 --> 24:14.121
I seen him give Roger
a bunch of money.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.665
Which one of these guys
is Roger?

24:15.721 --> 24:17.200
Over there by the oven.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.466
ED: Your boss witnessed
a felony, Roger.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.831
What are you
talking about?

24:24.897 --> 24:27.036
The gun you sold
Bobby Sabo?

24:28.334 --> 24:29.438
I'm gonna get fired.

24:29.501 --> 24:30.741
BRISCOE: I don't really care.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.917
If you come clean with us, maybe
you're not gonna get arrested.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.551
All right. So I know Bobby from the old neighborhood.
He comes by, flashing some green.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.148
Says he wants to
buy a new piece.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.487
What do you mean, "new"?

24:42.681 --> 24:43.989
Well, I asked him where
he got all the money,

24:44.049 --> 24:46.928
he said he sold his old .25
to some Dominican dude.

24:46.986 --> 24:47.987
We need a name.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.123
I don't know his name.

24:49.188 --> 24:52.499
Don't play dumb with us, Roger.
We've been doing this all night.

24:52.558 --> 24:54.265
I'm being straight
with you, okay?

24:54.326 --> 24:58.399
All I know is I seen him at the
bodega up on 171 in the afternoons.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.843
There's our guy.
Which one?

25:08.107 --> 25:10.678
Red jacket. He's carrying
heavy on the right side.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.986
Hold on, Lennie. We guess wrong, we spook
the guy that bought Bobby's piece.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.218
It's not a guess.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.356
Hey, you.
Step over here.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.294
What's your name?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.353
They call me Flaco.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.897
Flaco what?

25:23.222 --> 25:24.462
What's this about?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.161
It's about the gun
in your pocket.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.829
What, you got X-ray eyes
or something?

25:27.893 --> 25:29.770
Yeah, that's right.
I got X-ray eyes.

25:29.828 --> 25:31.034
Check his right pocket.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.734
Whoa! You gotta be
kidding me, man!

25:32.798 --> 25:33.902
I wish I was.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.445
I... I didn't do nothing!

25:35.501 --> 25:37.139
BRISCOE:
Oh, looks like a .25.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.203
Damn.

25:38.270 --> 25:41.479
Too bad, Flaco. You had to
run into Superman today.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.122
So you got the hardware,

25:45.477 --> 25:46.751
how about
letting me walk?

25:46.979 --> 25:50.950
We sent the gun to ballistics. It was
used to kill a lady on Manhattan Avenue.

25:51.450 --> 25:52.588
I don't shoot people.

25:52.651 --> 25:54.562
We don't think
you're the shooter.

25:54.620 --> 25:55.894
Maybe just an accessory.

25:55.955 --> 25:59.061
Oh, so I go down for murder even
though I got nothing to do with it?

25:59.258 --> 26:03.365
Our boss is kicking our asses here.
We'd put this on you in a second.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.203
I'm figuring there's something
in it for me, Papa.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.512
We're gonna
take care of you.

26:09.668 --> 26:10.976
No, forget about that.

26:11.036 --> 26:14.779
You give us the guy who sold you the
gun or we charge you with murder.

26:15.507 --> 26:18.010
Oh, you're doing that good
cop, bad cop thing, right?

26:18.077 --> 26:21.024
Oh, you don't wise up, it's
gonna be bad cop, bad cop.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.757
I want a deal
on the gun possession.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.727
You're gonna have to
testify against the seller.

26:25.784 --> 26:28.196
Plus you do the 30 days
you owe on the fare-beat.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.694
I'll do the 30 days.

26:30.789 --> 26:32.826
But I ain't gonna testify.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.800
Fine. Then you're being charged
with murder in the second degree.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.632
ED: You're looking at the
difference between life in prison

26:38.697 --> 26:40.472
and some kind of city time.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.406
Puerto Rican guy.

26:44.503 --> 26:46.005
Name is Bobby.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.152
Check it out.
These boys never learn.

26:52.377 --> 26:53.720
I'll do the honors.
What's up now?

26:56.382 --> 26:57.759
Yo, they're too tight!

26:57.816 --> 26:59.227
BRISCOE: Ah, too bad, Bobby.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.491
Yeah. Bring it on, man. You're
just making my lawsuit fatter.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.295
Keep talking, smart-ass.
We got your gun.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.133
We're finally
on solid ground.

27:10.195 --> 27:13.199
Sabo's been indicted.
We have his murder weapon.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.403
Prints?

27:14.466 --> 27:18.471
It was wiped clean, but we have a
witness who bought it from Sabo.

27:21.940 --> 27:25.149
Mr. Ochoa has a few
misdemeanor convictions.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.588
Our circumstantial evidence
bolsters his credibility.

27:28.213 --> 27:31.592
This man couldn't get work
as a used car salesman.

27:32.217 --> 27:34.788
Well, we made a deal with him
to testify against Sabo.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.298
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

27:36.355 --> 27:37.629
What now?

27:37.689 --> 27:39.259
Ochoa's moving to
suppress the gun.

27:40.526 --> 27:42.130
You have a deal?

27:43.161 --> 27:44.367
We did.

27:44.930 --> 27:46.273
Wonderful.

27:46.598 --> 27:49.340
Detective Briscoe served
three years in anti-crime.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.972
He was trained to recognize
individuals who carry guns.

27:52.037 --> 27:53.744
The detective played
a hunch.

27:53.806 --> 27:57.185
The police can't pat down law-abiding
pedestrians on intuition.

27:57.242 --> 27:58.585
This was more
than intuition.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.624
The suspect was walking
in an unusual manner

28:00.679 --> 28:02.215
which indicated
he had a handgun...

28:02.281 --> 28:04.056
Or a cell phone,
or hemorrhoids.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.562
Did your detective have
reason to think Mr. Ochoa

28:06.618 --> 28:08.757
was engaged in
any criminal conduct?

28:08.821 --> 28:12.325
It was possible Mr. Ochoa bought
the weapon from a murder suspect.

28:12.391 --> 28:13.961
He was a possible
accessory to murder.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.903
Possible, possible,
possible.

28:15.961 --> 28:17.872
It turned out
the detective was right.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.671
No. I don't buy it,
Ms. Carmichael.

28:19.731 --> 28:23.076
The Fourth Amendment requires a
little more than just a funny walk.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.579
This police tactic has been
accepted in other cases.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.548
Not in my court.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.687
I'm suppressing the gun,
dismissing the indictment.

28:30.742 --> 28:32.380
And releasing Mr. Ochoa?

28:32.444 --> 28:34.253
He owes 30 days
on a turnstile jump.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.452
Nothing I can do about that.

28:43.655 --> 28:44.690
(BUZZER BUZZING)

28:44.757 --> 28:47.966
BRISCOE: You're still gonna
testify against Bobby.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.105
Why would I wanna
do that?

28:50.162 --> 28:53.336
Because he gunned down
a nice lady in cold blood.

28:54.099 --> 28:56.306
What's he gonna do to me
if I drop a dime?

28:56.368 --> 28:57.438
We can move you.

28:57.502 --> 29:00.210
I ain't going to
no Staten Island, Papa.

29:00.505 --> 29:02.712
Yo, I'm happy
with my life right now, yo.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.352
Then we tell Bobby
you gave him up.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.955
(SCOFFS) I don't testify,
I'm cool.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.117
Then you leave
the D.A. no choice.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.127
They're charging you
as an accessory to murder.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.226
All I did was buy a gun.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.196
Nothing to do
with no murder.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.860
You want to bet
25 years it doesn't?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.433
Ain't much of a bet, yo.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.492
We had a deal.

29:21.126 --> 29:22.696
Hey, my lawyer
beat the case!

29:22.761 --> 29:24.832
Your lawyer's not here!
I'm talking to you!

29:24.897 --> 29:26.808
Lennie!
Lennie, come on!

29:28.033 --> 29:29.034
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

29:29.534 --> 29:32.242
Damn. Your boy's wound up
too tight, yo.

29:33.138 --> 29:35.379
Do the right thing
here, Flaco.

29:36.975 --> 29:38.977
I do my 30 days,
I'm done.

29:43.281 --> 29:44.453
(BUZZER BUZZING)

29:44.516 --> 29:46.621
Next time you lay a hand on
me when I'm with a suspect...

29:46.685 --> 29:48.028
I was afraid you were
gonna mess the guy up.

29:48.086 --> 29:50.191
Oh! Oh, only you
can do that?

29:50.255 --> 29:53.634
This guy was our last chance, Lennie.
He was gonna help us.

29:53.692 --> 29:55.433
All the guy was giving us
was attitude.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.303
Fine. Let's just keep
doing it your way.

29:57.362 --> 29:59.308
We'll be chasing
this case till next year.

29:59.364 --> 30:01.401
You want out
say the word.

30:09.741 --> 30:11.880
Ochoa's gun case
was tossed.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.957
He refuses to testify
against Sabo.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.956
And now Sabo's lawyer

30:17.149 --> 30:19.493
is moving to suppress
the confession.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.394
Yeah, the one
Detective Briscoe heard.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.330
The one only he heard.

30:25.190 --> 30:28.933
He says Sabo copped to it, that
should be good enough for us.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.496
Lennie Briscoe

30:31.196 --> 30:34.302
has kicked the ball
out onto the fairway before.

30:39.638 --> 30:43.916
BRISCOE: My partner and I arrived at
the playground to arrest Mr. Sabo.

30:44.109 --> 30:48.182
We observed him playing basketball
along with several other individuals.

30:48.413 --> 30:50.222
What did you do next?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.659
I went to place handcuffs
on Mr. Sabo.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.891
My partner and some
uniformed officers moved

30:54.953 --> 30:58.400
his friends off to one side
to keep them from interfering.

30:58.457 --> 30:59.936
JACK: How far away?

30:59.992 --> 31:01.266
About 30 feet.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.397
JACK: Then what
happened, Detective?

31:03.462 --> 31:07.000
While I was cuffing Mr. Sabo,
he blurted out a statement.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.707
What did he say?

31:09.801 --> 31:12.782
He said, "I gave that white
bitch what she deserved."

31:12.838 --> 31:14.681
JACK: He just said that
out of the blue?

31:14.740 --> 31:17.346
He was responding to
a comment I made.

31:18.176 --> 31:19.712
JACK: What was that?

31:19.778 --> 31:24.090
I said, "You little bastard, I'm arresting
you for the murder of Eva Harrison."

31:28.520 --> 31:31.729
You were the only one
to hear Mr. Sabo say this,

31:31.790 --> 31:33.895
even though your partner
was 10 yards away?

31:34.659 --> 31:36.764
There was a lot of
commotion at the time.

31:36.828 --> 31:40.037
And 20 minutes after
you claimed he said this,

31:40.232 --> 31:42.439
Mr. Sabo told your lieutenant that
you were trying to frame him?

31:42.701 --> 31:45.773
BRISCOE: He said a lot
of things, most of it...

31:46.138 --> 31:48.550
You can take with
a grain of salt.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.043
Isn't it true

31:51.109 --> 31:55.387
that you illegally seized evidence you
were planning to use against Mr. Sabo?

31:55.447 --> 31:56.790
That's what a judge said.

31:56.848 --> 31:59.124
And doesn't that demonstrate the
lengths that you would go to

31:59.184 --> 32:00.390
to incriminate Mr. Sabo?

32:00.452 --> 32:02.693
Mr. Sabo incriminated
himself.

32:04.156 --> 32:07.069
The first time you tried to
arrest my client, he eluded you?

32:07.292 --> 32:08.293
Right.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.373
And there was a problem the second
time you tried to arrest him?

32:11.430 --> 32:12.966
He exposed himself to me.

32:13.565 --> 32:16.171
You don't like my client
very much, do you, Detective?

32:16.234 --> 32:18.578
I don't usually get along
with murderers, no.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.140
Mr. Sabo gave you
a lot of attitude.

32:21.206 --> 32:25.677
Your client's a hump, but he said what he said.
I'm not making up evidence.

32:25.777 --> 32:29.315
Would it be fair to say that you've
been accused of cutting corners before?

32:29.381 --> 32:32.555
Accused? My personnel
file is clean.

32:32.617 --> 32:35.188
This is a big case,
isn't it, Detective?

32:35.253 --> 32:37.233
A lot of pressure
to bring in a suspect?

32:37.289 --> 32:38.563
To bring in the killer.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.832
Your superiors were all over you.
You were failing.

32:42.227 --> 32:47.074
Isn't it true that the only reason my
client made this immaculate confession

32:47.132 --> 32:49.669
is because you can't cut
legitimate police work anymore?

32:49.734 --> 32:50.735
Objection.

32:50.802 --> 32:51.803
JUDGE: Sustained.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.508
No, I wanna answer that.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.751
You can ask my superiors.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.083
The quality of
my work is just fine.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.589
This is not about me,
it's about him.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.285
He said he did it.
He killed that lady.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.361
First time I met this Detective
Briscoe, I knew he didn't like me.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.335
Why did you think that?

33:14.493 --> 33:16.268
Well, I know I shouldn't have
run away from the cops,

33:16.328 --> 33:18.501
but that's what we have to do
where I live.

33:18.563 --> 33:21.100
I think he has some kind of
grudge against me 'cause of that.

33:21.666 --> 33:25.671
When Detective Briscoe apprehended
you, at the Port Authority,

33:26.037 --> 33:27.573
did you expose
yourself to him?

33:27.639 --> 33:29.710
All I was doing was
taking a leak.

33:29.774 --> 33:30.980
He wouldn't even
let me finish.

33:31.042 --> 33:33.352
He made me do it
all over my brand new AJ's.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.982
And when he arrested you later
on the basketball court,

33:37.482 --> 33:38.859
did you ever say,

33:38.917 --> 33:41.193
"I gave that white bitch
what she deserved?"

33:41.253 --> 33:42.926
No, ma'am. No way.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.162
What did you say?

33:47.692 --> 33:50.195
I said, "Don't hook
me up too tight,"

33:50.629 --> 33:53.439
'cause I knew that's
what he was gonna do.

33:58.303 --> 34:01.307
You've been arrested
how many times, Mr. Sabo?

34:01.373 --> 34:03.046
You got the sheet.

34:03.608 --> 34:05.383
Six, seven.

34:05.510 --> 34:06.989
Maybe it was 12?

34:07.279 --> 34:08.815
Yeah, all right.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.956
You have eight misdemeanor convictions
and two felony convictions?

34:13.952 --> 34:15.260
Something like that.

34:15.353 --> 34:18.094
All of which were for
robbery or larceny?

34:18.356 --> 34:19.835
If that's what it says.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.871
And who should we believe
about this, Mr. Sabo,

34:25.931 --> 34:27.933
you or Detective Briscoe?

34:28.333 --> 34:29.368
Me.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.547
The one who ran
from the police?

34:32.003 --> 34:33.447
I explained that already.

34:33.538 --> 34:35.574
Hid from the authorities
in a friend's apartment?

34:35.639 --> 34:36.947
They're trying to frame me.

34:37.007 --> 34:38.612
Tried to hop a bus
out of town?

34:38.677 --> 34:40.281
Man, he's the one
who's lying.

34:40.344 --> 34:42.723
Why would I say I did
something I didn't do?

34:42.781 --> 34:44.054
It don't make sense.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.198
It's normally not
my inclination

34:59.264 --> 35:01.870
to value the word
of a convicted felon

35:02.133 --> 35:04.613
over a police officer.
But here,

35:05.237 --> 35:08.309
there's evidence of animus
by Detective Briscoe

35:08.373 --> 35:09.977
that turns everything
on its head.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.988
He has conducted
an illegal search,

35:13.111 --> 35:16.558
he was indignant with the
defendant for eluding capture,

35:16.615 --> 35:19.289
and he has a palpable
attitude of dislike

35:19.351 --> 35:21.729
which I detected
from the witness stand.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.493
The final straw
is this confession

35:24.589 --> 35:26.262
is uncorroborated.

35:26.324 --> 35:29.168
Therefore, I'm suppressing
the statement.

35:29.461 --> 35:32.408
With the confession excluded, there's
no evidence against Mr. Sabo.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.307
We have a bike similar to
the one used in the murder.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.811
We have evidence
of flight.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.938
It's a house of cards,
Judge.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.643
She's right, Mr. McCoy.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.582
I'll give you 24 hours.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.850
If you can't marshal
any legitimate evidence here,

35:46.611 --> 35:48.522
I'll dismiss the indictment.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.354
I heard the news.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.629
We get the gun, they toss it,
we get the confession...

35:58.690 --> 35:59.725
We?

36:01.726 --> 36:04.206
I've been saying "we"
to cover your ass.

36:04.262 --> 36:05.434
Out of respect for you.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.374
I don't need
that kind of respect.

36:07.432 --> 36:11.005
Good, 'cause I've been walking on egg
shells ever since we caught this case.

36:11.069 --> 36:12.912
It's about as long as
you've been pissing me off.

36:13.438 --> 36:14.815
Pissing you off? Why?

36:14.873 --> 36:16.614
Because I don't blend in
with the rest of the roaches?

36:17.442 --> 36:19.183
Oh, is that what
this is about?

36:19.244 --> 36:20.746
Because you know
that's not how I meant that!

36:20.812 --> 36:22.416
No, no, no.
I will tell you what I know.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.154
If it wasn't for your screw-ups, we'd
have nailed this guy a long time ago.

36:25.216 --> 36:26.524
My screw-ups?

36:26.584 --> 36:29.326
Your stuff's been getting thrown out
of court ever since you got here.

36:29.387 --> 36:31.924
Well, maybe I take chances because
my partner can't get it up!

36:31.990 --> 36:33.833
Well, maybe you just get off
on taking chances...

36:33.892 --> 36:35.371
VAN BUREN: Briscoe!

36:37.195 --> 36:38.674
In my office.

36:46.705 --> 36:47.809
What's going on?

36:47.872 --> 36:48.942
I'm done working
with Green.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.145
The hell you are.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.313
I don't need him second-guessing
everything I do.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.549
Green's not your problem.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.614
Then what is my problem?
You tell me.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.626
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

36:57.682 --> 36:59.389
You think I'm too old
to cut it?

36:59.451 --> 37:01.897
Whoa! Now where's
that coming from?

37:02.187 --> 37:04.292
From the flavor of the month
out there.

37:04.356 --> 37:07.428
You've been here six years. You
know I don't play favorites.

37:07.492 --> 37:10.439
Well, six years should count for
something more than my pension.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.702
Look, I'm behind you, Lennie.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.808
But I believe this case
is messing with you.

37:15.867 --> 37:19.474
This case pans out the same
whether I'm 25 or 75.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.417
Right. I'm glad
you feel that way.

37:23.008 --> 37:26.581
So pull yourself together
because it isn't over.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.084
(DOOR OPENING)

37:40.992 --> 37:44.337
Uh, can I have that
transcript I threw at you?

37:57.609 --> 37:59.054
What you thinking?

37:59.110 --> 38:04.583
Sabo testified in court that he took a
leak on a brand new pair of sneakers.

38:04.849 --> 38:07.693
Yeah, his cousin brought him
clothes from their apartment.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.863
So what happened to
his old felony flyers?

38:11.890 --> 38:14.496
Yeah, Bobby left
a pair of shoes here.

38:14.626 --> 38:15.661
He booked out quick.

38:15.727 --> 38:16.831
What'd they look like?

38:16.895 --> 38:18.374
Uh, running shoes.
Gray and black.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.500
You still have them?

38:19.564 --> 38:20.804
Size 10.

38:21.232 --> 38:22.768
Too big for me.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.480
I'm saving them
for my nephew.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.675
All right.
Let's take a look.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.853
Here you go.

38:35.013 --> 38:38.460
We found blood spatters on
the laces of the right shoe.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.328
Aren't you people tired
of playing cat and mouse yet?

38:42.387 --> 38:44.389
Must be.
They always lose.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.502
These shoes could've
come from anywhere.

38:46.558 --> 38:49.505
The lab matched the DNA
to the woman you murdered.

38:49.561 --> 38:52.906
We have 10 witnesses who'll testify
they saw you in those shoes.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.375
Yeah, right.

38:54.866 --> 38:57.642
Latent matched a thumb print
on the heel to your client.

38:58.736 --> 39:01.148
There are no suppression
issues this time, Ms. Torres.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.015
Your client's run out
of miracles.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.657
So how do we
make this go away?

39:07.846 --> 39:10.486
It's not going away.
We have a capital case.

39:17.389 --> 39:19.391
Let me ask you something.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.232
(WHISPERING INAUDIBLY)

39:30.335 --> 39:33.111
In his recent travels through
the criminal justice system,

39:33.171 --> 39:35.173
my client's met some
interesting characters.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.345
No doubt.
I'm sure they'll miss him.

39:37.642 --> 39:39.644
They've told him stories.

39:40.144 --> 39:42.784
He has information on
the Murray Hill rapist.

39:42.847 --> 39:45.521
He'll give it up in exchange
for man one, 6-to-12.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.434
How do we know
the information's reliable?

39:53.958 --> 39:56.495
This loco,
he takes souvenirs, right?

39:57.429 --> 39:58.533
He told me about them.

39:58.596 --> 40:00.439
You could have read that
in newspapers.

40:01.800 --> 40:05.179
I didn't read where he takes
their short and curlies.

40:05.336 --> 40:08.283
But, hey, if you want him
to do another schoolgirl...

40:08.339 --> 40:10.182
TORRES: Look, we'll make it
easy for you.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.654
His information doesn't click,
we're both free agents.

40:14.813 --> 40:18.022
He'll have to admit the
shooting in his allocution.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.030
No problem.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.360
One other thing.

40:29.327 --> 40:31.000
Detective Briscoe.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.097
What about him?

40:35.300 --> 40:37.075
You really shook him up.

40:37.302 --> 40:38.804
Yeah, I guess I did.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.850
You went one on one
and you beat him.

40:40.905 --> 40:42.907
Hey, we ain't all stupid.

40:45.743 --> 40:48.724
So what did you say to him
when he arrested you?

40:49.314 --> 40:51.294
What I told the old cop?

40:53.218 --> 40:55.960
That I gave that bitch
what she deserved.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.264
(DOOR CLOSING)

41:05.330 --> 41:07.776
I cannot believe you're
seriously considering this.

41:07.832 --> 41:12.042
The police had a task force on this
serial rapist for five months.

41:12.337 --> 41:14.977
Seven knife-point rapes
in Murray Hill.

41:15.306 --> 41:18.810
Every other week another
young woman is assaulted.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.048
We can talk to
Sabo's cellmates,

41:21.112 --> 41:22.614
everyone he came
in contact with.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.853
It is only a matter of time
before something breaks.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.896
Explain that to
his next victim.

41:26.951 --> 41:28.931
CARMICHAEL: Sabo gunned down
a woman in cold blood.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.297
Briscoe and Green went through
hell to nail this guy.

41:31.356 --> 41:32.733
That's their job.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.497
Make the deal.

41:46.437 --> 41:48.474
I just heard from the D.A.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.586
They cut a deal
with Bobby Sabo.

41:51.109 --> 41:53.020
No needle?
Big surprise.

41:53.411 --> 41:55.391
VAN BUREN:
No. Six-to-12.

41:56.381 --> 41:58.224
(SCOFFS)
What, years or weeks?

41:58.283 --> 42:00.490
Sabo gave up
the Murray Hill rapist.

42:00.551 --> 42:02.224
They collared the guy
two hours ago.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.333
And Lennie.

42:08.259 --> 42:11.001
McCoy says Sabo
copped to the confession.

42:13.498 --> 42:15.500
How nice of my pal Bobby.

42:16.334 --> 42:19.872
And tell him I plan on doing
this job from my wheelchair.
