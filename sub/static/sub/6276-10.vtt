WEBVTT

00:12.625 --> 00:14.125
Previously on Ray Donovan...

00:15.667 --> 00:16.583
You need to stop seeing my wife.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.750
That's up to her.

00:18.834 --> 00:19.917
Where are the pictures?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.083
Uh, right there, folder.

00:23.166 --> 00:23.333
The other pictures.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.458
ABBY:
Don't you get it?

00:27.542 --> 00:30.250
All I ever wanted was
for you to look at me!

00:30.333 --> 00:32.709
But you can't. You
can't talk to me.

00:32.792 --> 00:34.333
You can't share your pain
with me.

00:34.417 --> 00:35.875
TERRY:
You're the love of my life.

00:35.959 --> 00:37.417
Come to Ireland and marry me.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.542
Hey, Cookie...

00:42.083 --> 00:43.792
(tires screech)

00:43.875 --> 00:46.000
RAY:
You heard the shots,

00:46.083 --> 00:46.917
and then you saw Cookie
walking away.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.458
Marvin?
RAY:
Did he see you?

00:49.542 --> 00:50.166
I don't know.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.041
She should go to the police.

00:51.125 --> 00:52.291
She should tell them
what she saw.

00:52.375 --> 00:55.375
You don't understand
how dangerous this guy is.

00:55.458 --> 00:56.458
He already killed one kid.

00:56.542 --> 00:59.500
How do you know her life
isn't already in danger?!

00:59.583 --> 01:00.583
I'm about to become
the number one

01:00.667 --> 01:03.041
law enforcement officer
in the United States.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.417
Hell, in the fucking

01:04.500 --> 01:05.250
free world, Mick!

01:05.333 --> 01:06.792
But you guys are gonna
bring me down.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.750
Let me get this straight.

01:08.834 --> 01:10.333
You like
watching Cochran

01:10.417 --> 01:11.792
fuck your wife?

01:11.875 --> 01:13.583
But he's your boss.

01:13.667 --> 01:14.959
How do you put up with that?

01:15.041 --> 01:16.250
You know what, Tom?

01:16.333 --> 01:17.792
We can fix this.

01:19.041 --> 01:21.125
SHORTY: You see
what I'm saying?

01:21.208 --> 01:23.875
We could knock
this place off real easy.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.333
The FBI said that Mickey offered

01:25.417 --> 01:28.542
to get Sully out of the country
as a part of their sting.

01:28.625 --> 01:31.625
Listen to me. You're being
played by Mickey and the FBI.

01:31.709 --> 01:32.792
Yeah.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.500
You ruined my fucking life, Ray.

01:34.583 --> 01:35.667
Okay.

01:35.750 --> 01:36.500
I really liked you.

01:36.583 --> 01:39.041
I trusted you.

01:39.125 --> 01:41.667
Ray.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.417
STEVE:
What's wrong, Ray?

01:43.500 --> 01:44.875
Come in.

01:44.959 --> 01:47.125
Tell me about your day.

02:20.417 --> 02:22.250
(laughs)

02:24.417 --> 02:25.625
Papaya?

02:28.542 --> 02:30.291
Swim?

02:30.375 --> 02:32.542
(groans)

02:32.625 --> 02:35.542
Every day, a man should
tempt the ocean's yin and yang

02:35.625 --> 02:36.959
with his presence.

02:37.041 --> 02:39.208
Let the ocean
decide his fate.

02:41.291 --> 02:44.208
(sighs)

02:44.291 --> 02:45.375
I got to go.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.166
Seems like you could use a day
of quiet reflection, Ray.

02:51.250 --> 02:54.250
All that heavy shit
going on at home.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.375
Your poor daughter's
dead boyfriend.

02:58.125 --> 03:00.041
Your wife...

03:00.125 --> 03:02.250
fucking another man.

03:06.417 --> 03:08.291
I drank too much.

03:08.375 --> 03:10.291
No, don't be like that.

03:10.375 --> 03:12.709
Don't go back
inside your shell.

03:12.792 --> 03:15.959
It's good to talk
to other men about your shit.

03:16.041 --> 03:18.375
It's good to open up.

03:23.792 --> 03:26.625
Hi, Ray.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.875
Bye.

03:36.834 --> 03:40.458
Look at that!

03:40.542 --> 03:43.166
That fucker is back, Ray!

03:43.250 --> 03:45.041
Look at that!
Shit.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.208
Oh, no, don't...

03:47.291 --> 03:49.125
(scoffs)

03:49.208 --> 03:51.083
Motherfucker.

03:56.291 --> 03:59.333
You came back for a beating,
didn't you?

03:59.417 --> 03:59.750
You little fuck!

03:59.834 --> 04:01.959
No! No!

04:02.041 --> 04:03.333
(shouts)

04:03.417 --> 04:04.834
(laughs)

04:06.458 --> 04:08.333
Is this what you want?

04:08.417 --> 04:08.625
No!

04:08.709 --> 04:11.000
Hey!

04:11.083 --> 04:14.542
Come on, Ray! (laughs)

04:14.875 --> 04:17.792
Come on!

04:17.875 --> 04:18.250
(whimpering)

04:18.333 --> 04:20.834
It's your turn!

04:23.500 --> 04:26.667
What are you
fucking doing?!

04:26.750 --> 04:28.917
I get it.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.667
Be merciful.

04:33.166 --> 04:34.667
Get out of here, Bob.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.125
He hits her!

04:36.208 --> 04:37.750
I've seen it!

04:37.834 --> 04:39.333
He hurts her! I
had to protect her!

04:39.417 --> 04:41.792
Get the fuck out of here now!

04:50.041 --> 04:52.750
Once, I was trapped

04:52.834 --> 04:56.792
at the base
of a 12-foot storm wave.

04:56.875 --> 04:59.291
I didn't panic.

04:59.375 --> 05:02.875
I surrendered
to the outcome.

05:02.959 --> 05:06.208
And the loving mother
spit me back out.

05:06.291 --> 05:09.000
Showed me mercy.

05:09.083 --> 05:12.417
Just like you just did
for that poor man.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.375
You hurt Ashley?

05:16.458 --> 05:19.959
That's a part
of our sexual life.

05:20.041 --> 05:22.709
And it's none
of his fucking business.

05:24.166 --> 05:25.875
You lay a finger on her again,
I'll fucking kill you,

05:25.959 --> 05:29.250
you understand me?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.709
Come on, Ray.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.583
Let's go in the water.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.834
Let's let the waves
wash everything away.

05:43.834 --> 05:46.625
Come on.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.667
I'm not fucking swimming
with you!

06:05.834 --> 06:07.750
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:07.834 --> 06:08.834
please stow
all of your belongings

06:08.917 --> 06:11.458
and turn off your portable
electronic devices.

06:11.542 --> 06:14.166
We will be landing
in Los Angeles shortly.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.625
EZRA (over earphones):
...we all were.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.959
Besides, Sean shot the girl
with your gun.

06:19.041 --> 06:20.542
High on your drugs.

06:20.625 --> 06:23.959
Ray said you were
in trouble anyway.

06:24.041 --> 06:25.792
You'd stolen a lot of money
from Sully.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.083
MICKEY:
That's no reason to frame

06:27.166 --> 06:28.667
your own father for murder.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.208
(sighs)

06:30.291 --> 06:32.333
(recorder clicks)

06:34.208 --> 06:34.917
You need to put that away, miss.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.834
Oh. I'm sorry.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.792
(gunshot)

07:16.875 --> 07:17.834
No!
(panting)

07:17.917 --> 07:20.750
Bridget?

07:22.208 --> 07:25.333
Bridget?! Bridget?

07:27.917 --> 07:29.709
What is it?

07:29.792 --> 07:31.625
(panting)

07:39.834 --> 07:40.750
It's...

07:40.834 --> 07:41.709
(sighs)

07:41.792 --> 07:43.125
Wh-What are you doing?

07:43.208 --> 07:45.291
(panting)

07:47.125 --> 07:48.959
I'm sorry, honey.

07:49.041 --> 07:51.125
It's nothing.

08:01.959 --> 08:05.041
(line ringing)

08:05.125 --> 08:07.250
(phone vibrating)

08:10.166 --> 08:11.208
Kate?

08:11.291 --> 08:11.917
I'm sick of your lies.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.500
Where are you?

08:14.583 --> 08:15.709
Go fuck yourself.

08:21.041 --> 08:23.333
(line ringing)

08:23.417 --> 08:24.959
Yeah.

08:25.041 --> 08:28.583
Avi, I need you to find out
where Kate McPherson is.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.250
Boston?

08:30.333 --> 08:31.375
No, I think she's in L.A.

08:31.458 --> 08:34.083
Boss, I think you should forget
about that woman.

08:34.166 --> 08:36.291
Just fucking find her.

08:38.667 --> 08:39.041
COCHRAN:
Yes, sir.

08:39.125 --> 08:41.750
I understand.

08:41.834 --> 08:43.500
No, no, no.
Thank you, Mr. President.

08:43.583 --> 08:47.917
Yes, sir. I will see you
in Washington.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.125
All right.

08:52.625 --> 08:53.917
Was that...?
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Oh. Did you get it?

08:55.083 --> 08:58.166
He said he thought
the people would feel safer

08:58.250 --> 09:00.750
if the country's super cop

09:00.834 --> 09:02.750
was looking after
our nation's security.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.583
(laughs)
(laughs): Oh, my God.

09:04.667 --> 09:07.458
I'm so proud of you.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.125
Washington, here we come.

09:09.208 --> 09:11.500
Mmm.
Mmm.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.834
(chuckles)
Oh, gosh.

09:13.917 --> 09:16.041
I have to lose weight.
No, no.

09:16.125 --> 09:17.083
Yes.
None of that.
You're perfect.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.709
Mwah.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.417
Yes! Yeah!
Oh, my... (gasps)

09:22.500 --> 09:23.625
(exhales)

09:23.709 --> 09:26.625
You know, the vetting process
begins immediately, right?

09:29.291 --> 09:32.583
I know
what we should do tonight.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.166
Celebrate with the Volchecks.

09:37.792 --> 09:40.041
Uh... let me think about that,
okay, sweetie?

09:40.125 --> 09:42.208
Okay.

09:42.291 --> 09:43.917
(kisses)

09:59.917 --> 10:01.959
(chuckling)

10:03.291 --> 10:05.834
Mm-hmm.

10:05.917 --> 10:07.000
(chuckles)

10:07.083 --> 10:11.291
I want to put you all in,
motherfucker.

10:11.375 --> 10:12.083
Not enough.

10:12.166 --> 10:14.542
Not enough chips.

10:14.625 --> 10:15.959
(groans)

10:16.041 --> 10:18.250
Uh...

10:22.583 --> 10:24.667
(sighs)

10:31.208 --> 10:32.709
Okay.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.959
Call.

10:39.625 --> 10:40.875
(chuckles)
Full house.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.333
Four of a kind.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.500
(shouts)

11:05.208 --> 11:05.959
(beeping)

11:09.166 --> 11:11.709
(sighs)
Lord today.

11:11.792 --> 11:12.917
(phone ringing)

11:16.834 --> 11:17.875
What?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.291
Are you with my father?

11:20.375 --> 11:22.208
No, man.
That reporter's back.

11:22.291 --> 11:24.000
I need you with him
all day today.

11:24.083 --> 11:24.625
You don't pay me enough.

11:24.709 --> 11:27.083
Get over there right now.

11:29.208 --> 11:30.583
I need more money.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.000
I can't spend all my time

11:32.083 --> 11:32.959
looking after
that pain in my ass.

11:33.041 --> 11:35.625
You want more money?
Do your fucking job.

11:35.709 --> 11:37.750
Keep my father in check.

11:59.917 --> 12:01.375
Oh, shit.

12:06.208 --> 12:08.625
MICKEY: All the wiring in
that pot place is ancient,

12:08.709 --> 12:09.542
obsolete.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.083
What a fucking break, huh?

12:12.208 --> 12:14.166
That lady reporter is here.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.083
What?
(knocking)

12:16.166 --> 12:19.834
KATE: Mr. Donovan?
It's Kate McPherson.

12:19.917 --> 12:23.291
I forgot to tell you. I gave her
the envelope that you left.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.417
She came back after
the division guys took you.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.583
I thought
you were dead.

12:29.500 --> 12:29.959
Did I fuck up?

12:31.917 --> 12:33.291
It's okay.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.000
No big deal.

12:36.542 --> 12:39.166
Hello, Mr. Donovan.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.000
What brings you
back to town?

12:41.083 --> 12:42.083
You remember Mike Renzetti?

12:42.166 --> 12:45.250
Who?

12:45.333 --> 12:46.667
Come on in.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.083
Mike Renzetti.

12:49.166 --> 12:51.000
Walpole.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.250
Told me Sully hated you.

12:58.417 --> 13:00.542
You go talking to rapists
in Walpole,

13:00.625 --> 13:02.208
you're gonna get wrong ideas.

13:02.291 --> 13:05.166
Told me you ratted out
Sully's entire family.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.125
That he would never
have trusted you

13:07.208 --> 13:10.333
to get him
out of the country.

13:10.417 --> 13:11.917
You want a drink?

13:13.417 --> 13:16.583
Maybe a joint?

13:17.959 --> 13:20.125
What happened to you
the night that you called me?

13:22.083 --> 13:23.375
Nothing.

13:23.458 --> 13:24.542
I showed up the next morning,
your door was busted

13:24.625 --> 13:26.375
and you were gone.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.166
Hmm.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.542
(chuckles)

13:29.625 --> 13:32.583
Somebody scared you.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.959
Then you told me a pack of lies.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.333
Nobody scares me, missy.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.792
Ray does.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Me scared of Ray?
It's the other way around.

13:47.083 --> 13:47.750
No, Ray isn't afraid of anyone.

13:47.834 --> 13:50.208
Oh, yeah?
He's afraid of me.

13:51.125 --> 13:54.625
He paid Sully to...

13:54.709 --> 13:56.125
(chuckles softly)

13:58.250 --> 14:00.208
Paid Sully to do what?

14:00.291 --> 14:02.542
(exhales)

14:02.625 --> 14:03.667
Ask Ray.

14:03.750 --> 14:06.709
Now, get the fuck
out of here.

14:22.834 --> 14:26.458
BRIDGET:
We could have taken the bus.

14:26.542 --> 14:28.583
You both got your phones?

14:28.667 --> 14:30.583
Why don't you loan me your gun?

14:30.667 --> 14:32.583
Don't be a
smart-ass, Bridg.

14:32.667 --> 14:35.125
I'm not comfortable with this.

14:38.041 --> 14:40.291
It's gonna be okay, Mom.

14:40.375 --> 14:41.917
(sighs)

14:43.542 --> 14:46.291
Be careful.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.750
(phone vibrating)

14:57.834 --> 14:59.125
Yeah?

14:59.208 --> 15:00.208
Boss, you were right.

15:00.291 --> 15:03.375
She arrived in L.A. this morning
and rented a car.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.542
Find her.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.000
EZRA: Can I offer you
some water, some juice?

15:13.083 --> 15:14.792
Raymond. We've just
signed over the rights

15:14.875 --> 15:17.542
to Marvin
and Re-Kon's music.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.959
And Mr. Brown
is our new client.

15:20.875 --> 15:22.125
Congratulations.

15:22.208 --> 15:24.542
This means I get access
to him now, right?

15:24.625 --> 15:26.291
LEE:
Of course.

15:26.375 --> 15:29.125
Give me a minute alone
with my nigga.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.583
Hey, look, I hear somebody
might be shopping a video

15:45.667 --> 15:47.375
of whoever killed 'Lil Homie.

15:48.917 --> 15:51.041
Who told you that?

15:51.125 --> 15:53.166
You know the streets, dawg.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.375
I'll look into it.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.750
I'll pay whatever
they want.

15:59.834 --> 16:03.959
I just want to see
whoever hurt my boy get justice.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.667
You and me... we cool?

16:11.625 --> 16:13.417
Sure.

16:29.709 --> 16:30.667
VOLCHECK:
To my mentor...

16:30.750 --> 16:33.667
and good friend.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.750
Here's...

16:35.834 --> 16:38.250
to many years...
of service together.

16:39.917 --> 16:43.417
You can leave
that with me.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.291
No, I'll give it
to him in person.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.750
TRAVIS: "Bathroom on the right"?
Hysterical.

16:47.834 --> 16:50.125
COCHRAN:
I knew another lead singer

16:50.208 --> 16:53.458
who thought that "Purple Haze"
was "'Scuse me while

16:53.542 --> 16:55.542
I kiss this guy."
"Excuse me while

16:55.625 --> 16:58.625
I kiss this guy"?
Not "kiss the sky,"
"kiss this guy."

16:58.709 --> 17:00.166
(laughs):
That is hysterical.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.750
I'm sorry
to interrupt.

17:01.834 --> 17:02.917
Hi, Tom.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.250
Travis was just leaving.

17:04.792 --> 17:07.041
Thank you, Travis.

17:07.125 --> 17:12.500
Sir, can I just say
how proud I am of you.

17:12.583 --> 17:13.834
Tommy, what
do you want?

17:13.917 --> 17:16.709
Well, I just...
wanted to know

17:16.792 --> 17:18.834
if I was going
to Washington with you.

17:20.333 --> 17:23.083
I don't think so, Tom, no.

17:28.208 --> 17:31.625
Well, then would you consider me
as your replacement here?

17:31.709 --> 17:32.834
Wow. (chuckles)

17:32.917 --> 17:35.125
My replacement, huh?

17:35.208 --> 17:37.792
That's what all this has
been about for you, huh?

17:37.875 --> 17:39.625
Just, uh, moving on
up in your career?

17:39.709 --> 17:40.792
No, of course not, sir.

17:40.875 --> 17:44.667
It's just that you've been
a mentor to me, and a guide,

17:44.750 --> 17:46.709
and I have the utmost
respect for you.

17:46.792 --> 17:48.542
And I thought since

17:48.625 --> 17:50.917
there was a position opening up
here now that maybe...

17:51.000 --> 17:52.917
You thought you'd just
slide on in there, huh?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.041
Of-of course not... sir.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.959
It's just... we've
all been so close...

17:58.041 --> 17:59.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:00.041 --> 18:02.291
Are you blackmailing
me, Tom?

18:02.375 --> 18:03.959
No.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.250
Are you sure?

18:05.333 --> 18:05.792
Yes, sir. Not at all.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.750
No. Sir, I'm just...

18:08.834 --> 18:11.041
Congratulations.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.959
You deserve it.

18:19.417 --> 18:21.000
I'm looking over everything.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.041
Everybody's got their job.

18:23.125 --> 18:25.959
And timing is important,
so you're important.

18:26.041 --> 18:27.250
I got this, Mick.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.333
I can blow that security guard
in two minutes,

18:29.417 --> 18:30.125
or I can blow him in ten.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.542
Make it go as
long as you can.

18:31.625 --> 18:33.625
Use your wiles.

18:33.709 --> 18:34.834
I won't tickle his balls, then.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.709
No finger up the ass.

18:36.792 --> 18:38.875
Oh, thank you for that.

18:38.959 --> 18:41.667
Guys... I don't think
you understand.

18:41.750 --> 18:45.333
I need two and a half hours
just to crack the safe.

18:45.417 --> 18:46.500
You're gonna get your time.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.500
This is just to get us in there
and hide.

18:48.583 --> 18:51.583
But we still need to go in
through the roof.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.667
Really? Why?

18:53.750 --> 18:55.750
Because if we go through the
door, there could be an alarm.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.000
No.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.834
They never put an alarm
on the roof. (coughing)

18:59.917 --> 19:01.917
We should tunnel in
throh the fucking floor.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.500
That'll only take us
a year and a half.

19:04.583 --> 19:05.333
(coughing continues)

19:09.458 --> 19:10.583
Are you all right?

19:10.667 --> 19:12.750
I'm fine, Mick.

19:12.834 --> 19:13.542
Seriously, I'm fine.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.875
KEITH:
Donovan, get out here.

19:15.959 --> 19:17.041
Hey.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.750
I'll be right back.

19:21.625 --> 19:24.125
Glad you came.

19:24.208 --> 19:26.834
I got something
I want to talk to you about.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.083
Step into my office.

19:34.709 --> 19:37.542
Let's say...

19:37.625 --> 19:41.500
one night in the
very near future...

19:41.583 --> 19:43.250
I needed to
turn this off.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.917
What would that
be worth to you?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.875
A thousand bucks?

19:50.500 --> 19:51.750
Five thousand?

19:51.834 --> 19:54.792
You got five grand?

19:54.875 --> 19:55.792
Not on me now.
I'm saying afterwards.

19:55.875 --> 19:58.250
You look the other way,

19:58.333 --> 19:59.709
I'll give you
five thousand.

19:59.792 --> 20:00.750
I'm a parole officer,

20:00.834 --> 20:04.750
and you just offered me
5,000 imaginary dollars.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.709
I could violate your ass,

20:06.792 --> 20:09.625
and it won't be
to some imaginary prison.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.375
But if I had real dollars,
you'd go for it?

20:17.375 --> 20:18.834
Mm.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.166
Here's the deal.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.166
You don't leave here.

20:29.250 --> 20:32.083
You report to La Playa
5:00 a.m. sharp.

20:32.166 --> 20:33.709
With the hairnet.

20:33.792 --> 20:35.625
Back to business
as usual.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.458
Where's that watch my son
gave you? You pawn it?

20:44.333 --> 20:47.291
How come he can
pay you off, I can't?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.875
Think about it.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.709
The fuck are you doing here?

21:06.792 --> 21:08.208
I need something.

21:08.291 --> 21:09.417
You really fucked up
my boyfriend.

21:09.500 --> 21:13.000
You broke his fucking femur.
He can't work out.

21:13.083 --> 21:15.291
He's gained, like, 20 pounds;
he looksike shit.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.208
Sits on his ass all day.

21:16.291 --> 21:19.291
And I can't even
break up with him.

21:20.208 --> 21:21.667
Who's the new guy?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.208
Fuck you, Ray.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.333
Here's your shake, Marty.
Thank you, Troy.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.500
You need me to stay.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.041
No.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.250
You heard anything
about a video

21:33.333 --> 21:36.542
of the Re-Kon-
Marvin Gaye murder?

21:36.625 --> 21:38.208
What if I have?

21:38.291 --> 21:39.709
I need it.

21:39.792 --> 21:44.166
Uh, that would be evidence in
a criminal investigation, Ray.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.583
I'd have to turn
that over to the police.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.667
Cut the crap.
How much, Marty?

21:48.750 --> 21:50.709
Footage like that
would be worth millions.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.917
Find it.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.625
And you have the money?

21:55.709 --> 21:58.375
I have a client who does.

21:58.458 --> 22:01.583
If I find it,
I want a million dollars.

22:01.667 --> 22:02.709
Done.

22:02.792 --> 22:06.291
And a year's worth
of exclusives on Tommy Wheeler.

22:06.375 --> 22:09.208
And I mean fucking exclusives.

22:09.291 --> 22:10.709
All right.

22:10.792 --> 22:13.250
Troy!

22:13.333 --> 22:15.917
Show Ray out.

22:59.208 --> 23:01.834
Miss, you can't smoke here.

23:02.792 --> 23:04.875
Sorry.

23:09.834 --> 23:12.125
Were you looking
for some eyeliner?

23:12.208 --> 23:13.458
Or blush?

23:13.542 --> 23:16.750
I don't know.

23:16.834 --> 23:18.917
Would you like
a makeover?

23:19.000 --> 23:19.917
A what?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.750
A makeover.

23:22.959 --> 23:24.917
Sure.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.375
Sit down.

23:32.542 --> 23:34.625
Your skin's so light.

23:34.709 --> 23:36.583
You have cool
blue undertones.

23:39.792 --> 23:42.333
If I use icy or jewel tones,
it'll really bring out...

23:42.417 --> 23:42.834
Can you just not talk?

23:42.917 --> 23:46.000
I'm sorry.

23:46.083 --> 23:49.125
Can you just do the makeover
and not talk?

23:49.208 --> 23:51.333
Of course.

23:51.417 --> 23:53.333
JIM (recorded): You've reached
Detective Jim Halloran.

23:53.417 --> 23:55.417
Leave a message,
I'll get right back to you.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.041
I need to see you.

23:58.125 --> 23:59.792
(line ringing)

23:59.875 --> 24:01.667
BOB:
Where the fuck have you been?

24:01.750 --> 24:03.375
The story we put out is wrong.

24:03.458 --> 24:05.166
You got to get
a retraction ready.

24:05.250 --> 24:06.000
I'm not printing
a fucking retraction.

24:06.083 --> 24:07.333
Just hear me out.

24:07.417 --> 24:10.583
I got something new. It's huge.

24:10.667 --> 24:12.333
I'm gonna bring down
the president's appointee

24:12.417 --> 24:13.792
for the head of the FBI.

24:13.875 --> 24:16.208
And maybe even solve
the Sean Walker murder.

24:16.291 --> 24:18.500
You sound like
a crazy person, Katie.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.041
Fuck you, Bob.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.667
I got this thing figured out.

24:21.750 --> 24:22.625
You'll see.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.583
Do you mind?

24:38.041 --> 24:41.000
Terrance! Terrance!

24:41.083 --> 24:42.542
What?

24:42.625 --> 24:45.750
Your brother's back on the cot,
sleeping all goddamn day.

24:47.709 --> 24:49.041
Well, leave him alone.

24:49.125 --> 24:50.375
Let him sleep.

24:50.458 --> 24:54.417
Hey. Can I talk to
you for a minute?

25:08.417 --> 25:10.208
Let's just go
to Ireland now.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.542
I-I don't have
the money.

25:12.625 --> 25:14.667
So? I saved about $40,000
for his college,

25:14.750 --> 25:15.667
and he doesn't need
to use it all.

25:15.750 --> 25:18.458
I ain't taking your
son's money, Frances.

25:18.542 --> 25:19.417
No, it's my money, Terry.
I earned it.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.250
I'm not letting you
take care of me.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.750
Because I'm a woman?

25:23.834 --> 25:25.709
No, because that's not
the way things are done.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.125
We don't have to be
citizens right away.

25:30.208 --> 25:31.542
We can get jobs.
No, no.

25:31.625 --> 25:33.750
That's not who I am.

25:33.834 --> 25:35.250
I have to own something.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.250
I'm a business owner.

25:37.333 --> 25:40.083
I know you are, Terry.

25:40.166 --> 25:41.750
But we have to start somewhere.

25:41.834 --> 25:44.208
I'm not taking your money.

25:45.959 --> 25:46.959
(sighs)

25:47.041 --> 25:47.834
Well, that's fucking ridiculous.

25:47.917 --> 25:50.291
Yeah? Well, I'm
still not taking it.

25:50.375 --> 25:53.125
Jesus Christ.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.667
Why haven't you found her yet?

26:04.750 --> 26:08.542
I got Lena over at the marina
in case she shows up.

26:08.625 --> 26:09.917
I don't know
what else to do.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.291
You check every
goddamn hotel in town.

26:11.375 --> 26:12.750
That's what you do.

26:12.834 --> 26:13.875
Why are you still
worried about this woman?

26:16.750 --> 26:18.333
Mind your fucking business, Avi.

26:18.417 --> 26:20.333
You are my fucking business!

26:21.792 --> 26:25.333
You are letting everything
fall apart over this woman!

26:25.417 --> 26:27.834
You let another man
fuck your wife,

26:27.917 --> 26:29.166
and you do
nothing about...!

26:29.250 --> 26:31.125
Shit!

26:31.208 --> 26:33.291
(panting)

26:34.542 --> 26:37.458
You don't fucking
get it, do you?

26:37.542 --> 26:41.291
We don't find
her, it's over.

26:41.375 --> 26:44.375
She prints what she knows,
we all go to prison.

26:45.291 --> 26:47.333
(phone vibrating)

26:47.417 --> 26:49.000
Yeah.

26:49.083 --> 26:49.959
Get in here.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.000
I know she's in town.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.333
I'll find her.

26:52.417 --> 26:54.417
I'm not talking on the phone
about this.

27:12.375 --> 27:14.333
Upload this and
send it to me.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.625
(panting)

27:23.709 --> 27:28.041
I don't understand
why we need anybody else.

27:28.125 --> 27:31.041
We got a good thing with just...

27:31.125 --> 27:32.792
you, me and Cherry.

27:34.875 --> 27:36.375
A little backup wouldn't hurt.

27:36.458 --> 27:37.750
Okay, just one, then.

27:37.834 --> 27:38.959
Just one more guy.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.709
See?

27:46.875 --> 27:48.000
Hey, Terry.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.875
You ever meet
my good friend Shorty?

27:52.166 --> 27:54.542
Nah.

27:54.625 --> 27:55.250
Okay.

27:55.333 --> 27:59.667
Well, now you have.

27:59.750 --> 28:02.917
You, uh, got 5,000 bucks
you can spot me?

28:05.917 --> 28:07.667
No.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.583
All right. Don't worry about it.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.041
Daryll here?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.834
He's in the locker room.

28:21.834 --> 28:22.875
You have a very
nice place here.

28:27.583 --> 28:28.875
Mickey speaks
very highly of you.

28:34.458 --> 28:36.125
Shorty, this is
my son, uh, Daryll.

28:36.208 --> 28:38.125
Daryll, meet my buddy Shorty.

28:38.208 --> 28:40.667
Hey.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.125
What do you want?

28:42.208 --> 28:43.542
Listen.

28:43.625 --> 28:45.291
I know that you always
wanted that car.

28:45.375 --> 28:48.959
It was wrong for me
to give that to Conor.

28:49.041 --> 28:50.333
You take it.

28:50.417 --> 28:52.875
You know, fix it
up a little bit.

28:52.959 --> 28:54.458
All I need is, uh...

28:54.542 --> 28:57.208
you know, maybe
5,000 bucks.

28:57.875 --> 29:00.166
It's worth at
least that.

29:00.250 --> 29:01.709
Fuck you, man.

29:01.792 --> 29:02.583
Hey, hey.

29:02.667 --> 29:05.583
Listen, listen, listen.
Get off me.

29:05.667 --> 29:09.417
You don't want the car,
I, uh...

29:09.500 --> 29:11.041
I'm doing a little deal.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.000
A little goodie.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.834
I'm gonna cut you in.

29:14.917 --> 29:17.959
You give me five grand,
I swear...

29:18.041 --> 29:20.792
you'll get a hundred thou
back inside a week.

29:21.458 --> 29:24.500
How you gonna do that?

29:24.583 --> 29:27.542
Well... planning
a little job.

29:28.917 --> 29:31.250
A job?

29:31.333 --> 29:34.000
A robbery. I was gonna
ask you to... to join up.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.834
I'm talking big money.

29:38.083 --> 29:41.500
You are so full of shit.

29:41.583 --> 29:44.667
I give you five grand, that's
the only thing I'll be missing.

29:44.750 --> 29:45.959
No way.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.000
Let's go.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.291
I got the money.

29:58.291 --> 29:59.875
What?

29:59.959 --> 30:02.875
I'll give you the money.

30:02.959 --> 30:04.125
But I'm in on the job.

30:09.709 --> 30:11.875
I don't know
about this, Mick.

30:13.959 --> 30:17.125
This thing works,
how much we talking about?

30:19.208 --> 30:21.667
Terry, you're not a criminal.

30:21.750 --> 30:24.041
You don't have
the stomach for it.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.500
Lend me five,
I'll give you back ten.

30:26.583 --> 30:28.709
Fuck you.

30:28.792 --> 30:29.959
I got nothing left.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.625
You want the money?

30:38.709 --> 30:41.417
You make me a partner.

30:46.041 --> 30:48.041
Congratulations.
Big day for you.

30:48.125 --> 30:49.458
Yeah, it would be.

30:49.542 --> 30:51.500
If your fucking girlfriend
wasn't back.

30:55.792 --> 30:57.208
(sniffles)

30:57.291 --> 30:58.709
KATE (recorded):
I got something new. It's huge.

30:58.792 --> 31:01.000
I'm gonna bring down
the president's

31:01.083 --> 31:02.041
appointee for the head
of the FBI.

31:02.125 --> 31:05.875
And maybe even solve
the Sean Walker murder.

31:06.792 --> 31:08.959
Uh, what are we
gonna do about her?

31:09.041 --> 31:10.750
I'm gonna find her
and set her straight.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.000
She has to go, Ray.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.709
I won't let you do that.

31:16.792 --> 31:19.291
Are you suicidal?
Do I have to kill you, too?

31:19.375 --> 31:20.166
We're not killing anyone.

31:25.709 --> 31:28.291
I'm about to be vetted

31:28.375 --> 31:30.750
by the entire Senate
Judiciary Committee, okay?

31:30.834 --> 31:32.125
And every fucking journalist

31:32.208 --> 31:34.625
in the country
over the next two weeks.

31:34.709 --> 31:36.625
Every rock will be turned over.

31:36.709 --> 31:38.500
Do you understand that?

31:38.583 --> 31:41.166
This woman is gonna
fuck everything up, Ray.

31:43.125 --> 31:44.875
No.

31:47.208 --> 31:49.208
This will fuck
everything up.

31:49.291 --> 31:52.041
(Megan moaning)

31:58.458 --> 32:02.041
You come after her or me,
this goes viral.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.750
Ray. Ray.

32:07.834 --> 32:10.667
(door closes)

32:10.750 --> 32:11.834
Oh, fuck, no.

32:11.917 --> 32:14.083
Oh, no. Fuck, no!

32:20.750 --> 32:22.291
Excuse me.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.333
Is Detective Jim Halloran here?

32:23.417 --> 32:26.208
Jim.

32:30.375 --> 32:30.875
Hey.
Hey.

32:30.959 --> 32:32.709
What are you doing here?

32:32.792 --> 32:35.083
I-I really have
to talk to you.

32:35.166 --> 32:37.667
Okay.
Okay.

32:37.750 --> 32:40.500
Come on.

32:49.417 --> 32:51.542
I need you... I need you
to do something for me.

32:51.625 --> 32:54.542
Anything.

32:54.625 --> 32:56.458
What?

32:57.959 --> 33:00.291
I need you to get rid
of Cookie Brown.

33:02.417 --> 33:04.959
What do you mean?

33:05.041 --> 33:06.625
Arrest him
or hurt him.

33:06.709 --> 33:08.834
Hurt him?

33:08.917 --> 33:10.875
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

33:10.959 --> 33:12.458
He-He's gonna
kill my daughter.

33:12.542 --> 33:14.125
Abby...
You plant something on him.

33:14.208 --> 33:16.834
Or you pull him over
and shoot him.

33:16.917 --> 33:18.458
Shoot him?

33:18.542 --> 33:19.625
He's a fucking criminal.

33:19.709 --> 33:20.875
I'm a cop.

33:20.959 --> 33:22.625
He's already killed two people.

33:22.709 --> 33:23.917
If you don't do something,

33:24.000 --> 33:26.333
he's gonna kill
my fucking daughter.

33:26.417 --> 33:28.583
If you want something done,
you need to get your daughter

33:28.667 --> 33:32.083
to show up and tell the truth
about what she saw.

33:32.959 --> 33:36.250
If you won't do this
for me, I...

33:36.333 --> 33:38.417
I can't see you anymore.

33:45.583 --> 33:47.667
Jim.

33:55.750 --> 33:57.834
Be a man.

34:14.375 --> 34:15.959
Tommy.

34:16.041 --> 34:17.208
Oh, sir.

34:17.291 --> 34:19.667
I'm glad to see you.
I-I want you to know

34:19.750 --> 34:21.583
that I was not
trying to manipulate

34:21.667 --> 34:23.750
our private relationship
for personal gain.

34:23.834 --> 34:26.500
You know all those times you
thought Megan was doing Pilates

34:26.583 --> 34:28.333
and I had my 1:30 briefing?

34:28.417 --> 34:31.041
I was fucking her.

34:34.709 --> 34:35.667
I'm... sorry to hear that, sir.

34:35.750 --> 34:38.000
(chuckles):
Well...

34:38.083 --> 34:40.709
You're gonna be a lot sorrier
when I stop fucking her.

34:41.834 --> 34:43.333
Sir, I don't think I understand.

34:43.417 --> 34:44.542
I thought about
what you asked me this morning,

34:44.625 --> 34:47.959
and you do deserve to be
a director, so congratulations.

34:48.041 --> 34:49.166
I made some calls.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.291
You're going to
Bismarck, North Dakota.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.834
Sir, please don't. I...

34:54.917 --> 34:56.709
Hey, you think
Megan's gonna follow you there?

34:56.792 --> 34:57.834
Think she's gonna cheer you on

34:57.917 --> 35:00.542
while you're out investigating
illegal elk hunting

35:00.625 --> 35:03.000
on the reservation?

35:03.083 --> 35:04.583
Why are you doing this to me?

35:04.667 --> 35:05.500
Why am I doing
this to you?

35:05.583 --> 35:06.709
You-you called Donna
and you told her

35:06.792 --> 35:08.709
that you wanted her.

35:08.792 --> 35:10.625
You invited us into your home.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.291
And you let that fuck

35:12.375 --> 35:16.166
plant cameras and record our
fucking private time together?

35:18.208 --> 35:19.250
(sighs)

35:19.333 --> 35:22.125
Turn up your nose
at fucking my beautiful wife

35:22.208 --> 35:23.333
and you set me up?!

35:27.000 --> 35:28.834
You're fucking finished.

35:31.417 --> 35:33.250
(door slams)

36:00.625 --> 36:02.583
Are you going
to the funeral?

36:03.375 --> 36:06.625
There's gonna be
so much coverage.

36:06.709 --> 36:08.125
Your picture's
gonna be everywhere.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.250
I hope not.

36:10.333 --> 36:11.667
Why not?

36:13.250 --> 36:15.500
Listen, do you want
to hang out this weekend?

36:16.709 --> 36:18.750
Hang out?

36:18.834 --> 36:21.000
If you need me to go
to the funeral

36:21.083 --> 36:21.917
with you or anything.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.667
You know, for support.

36:26.458 --> 36:28.166
Support?

36:28.250 --> 36:30.875
You wouldn't even
talk to me last week.

36:30.959 --> 36:32.417
You didn't even
know my name.

36:51.625 --> 36:52.959
CONOR:
Hey.

36:53.041 --> 36:54.000
What is it?

36:54.083 --> 36:56.792
I wanted to see you.

36:56.875 --> 36:59.291
Why?

36:59.375 --> 37:02.208
Everybody's so
full of shit.

37:03.250 --> 37:06.083
They're never gonna
catch who did it, are they?

37:10.125 --> 37:13.709
Conor... I was
in the car.

37:14.125 --> 37:16.417
You saw it?

37:18.959 --> 37:20.917
You know who did it?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.875
Yeah.

37:22.959 --> 37:25.208
And Daddy made me
lie to the police.

37:25.291 --> 37:27.083
They're never
gonna arrest him.

37:27.166 --> 37:28.417
That's fucked up.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.291
You're right, Con.
It is fucked up.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.083
Everything's fucked up.

37:34.709 --> 37:36.834
I met Mom's boyfriend.

37:38.458 --> 37:39.959
What's he like?

37:42.083 --> 37:44.667
Do you still like M&M'S?

37:44.750 --> 37:46.792
Yeah.

37:48.709 --> 37:49.500
Come on.

37:54.083 --> 37:56.333
He's okay.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.500
What if he has a bunch of kids
and we have to live with them?

38:01.583 --> 38:03.542
I don't think
he has any kids.

38:07.709 --> 38:09.792
Thanks.

38:27.750 --> 38:29.250
(beeping)

38:31.959 --> 38:33.417
RAY:
Abby?

38:41.041 --> 38:43.500
Where are the kids?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.458
School.

38:51.583 --> 38:53.208
You look pretty, Abs.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.375
We got to go.

38:57.458 --> 38:59.834
What are you
talking about?

38:59.917 --> 39:02.500
We need to leave town.
We need to go back to Boston.

39:02.583 --> 39:04.583
Abby, we're not
going back to Boston.

39:04.667 --> 39:06.750
You can't be sure
he didn't see her, Ray.

39:08.750 --> 39:09.291
It's fine, sweetheart.

39:09.375 --> 39:11.083
Everything's gonna be...

39:11.166 --> 39:12.458
No, don't touch me.

39:23.583 --> 39:25.000
(sighs)

39:28.000 --> 39:30.792
You know I'd never let anything
happen to you or the kids.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.500
(phone vibrating)

39:43.917 --> 39:45.125
Yeah?

39:45.208 --> 39:45.625
I know where she is.

39:49.166 --> 39:51.583
(sighs)

40:03.458 --> 40:04.625
Are you coming
back, Daddy?

40:07.625 --> 40:09.583
Soon, sweetheart.

40:20.417 --> 40:22.291
You fucking left again.

40:22.375 --> 40:22.875
That's it. I'm
writing you up.

40:22.959 --> 40:25.000
Not so fast.

40:25.083 --> 40:26.500
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

40:26.583 --> 40:29.458
How many times I got
to come looking for you?

40:45.542 --> 40:46.792
(sniffles)

40:50.583 --> 40:52.709
Half now, half later.

40:55.417 --> 40:59.000
Like I said,
tomorrow or the next day,

40:59.083 --> 41:02.041
I tell you to turn me off,
you turn me off.

41:03.417 --> 41:06.250
What do you
got planned?

41:06.333 --> 41:09.375
You got your money.
No questions.

41:09.458 --> 41:14.208
Look, all I'm saying is, what
if I wanted more than $5,000?

41:14.291 --> 41:16.458
What would I have to do?

41:17.583 --> 41:20.417
Ooh.

41:22.750 --> 41:24.583
Okay.

41:58.667 --> 42:00.208
You gonna kill me, Ray?

42:00.291 --> 42:02.834
You need to let go of this.

42:02.917 --> 42:07.667
I don't believe a word
that comes out of your mouth.

42:07.750 --> 42:10.041
You lied about everything.

42:10.125 --> 42:11.583
I had to.
Why?

42:11.667 --> 42:12.875
To keep you alive.

42:12.959 --> 42:15.625
Bullshit. You didn't want
to go to fucking prison.

42:19.792 --> 42:21.125
(sighs)

42:21.208 --> 42:23.500
You keep this up,
you're gonna end up dead, Kate.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.625
So what?

42:25.709 --> 42:28.166
Journalists die all the time--
occupational hazard.

42:29.792 --> 42:34.291
You want to tell me
why you paid two million dollars

42:34.375 --> 42:36.291
to have Sully
kill your father?

42:43.542 --> 42:45.583
You don't quit, do you?

42:45.667 --> 42:47.458
No.

42:47.542 --> 42:49.375
What'd you get for dinner?

42:52.709 --> 42:55.250
Burger. Want half?

42:55.333 --> 42:57.834
Yeah, sure. Fucking starving.

43:04.375 --> 43:06.500
Thanks.

43:14.250 --> 43:16.542
So, why do you hate
your dad so much?

43:16.625 --> 43:17.750
What'd he do?

43:23.542 --> 43:25.083
He was supposed to take me
to a baseball game.

43:25.166 --> 43:28.041
Never showed up.

43:28.125 --> 43:29.834
Come on, Ray.

43:29.917 --> 43:31.792
I'm serious.

43:34.834 --> 43:37.208
I know that Sean Walker
killed that girl,

43:37.291 --> 43:39.083
and that you
framed him for it.

43:39.166 --> 43:41.041
Why?

43:48.250 --> 43:50.125
All right, fuck it.

43:50.208 --> 43:52.875
My father was Sean's dealer.

43:52.959 --> 43:54.500
Sean got high,

43:54.583 --> 43:56.208
Mickey let him play
with his gun.

43:56.291 --> 44:00.083
Fucking idiot thought
it was a toy, fired it,

44:00.166 --> 44:02.291
that was the end of Colleen.

44:02.375 --> 44:04.542
So, you blame
Mickey for that?

44:04.625 --> 44:05.291
Yeah, I fucking blame him.

44:05.375 --> 44:07.041
Everything he touches

44:07.125 --> 44:09.542
turns to shit.

44:09.625 --> 44:12.041
My mother's dying of cancer,
my sister's using.

44:12.125 --> 44:13.834
Finally, she throws herself
off a roof.

44:13.917 --> 44:16.542
Where the fuck was he?

44:16.625 --> 44:17.709
Getting high.

44:17.792 --> 44:22.083
Screwing some whore
in the projects.

44:22.166 --> 44:23.667
(sighs)

44:25.792 --> 44:27.917
I did some research.

44:36.583 --> 44:39.667
The day your father
gets out of prison,

44:39.750 --> 44:41.291
the priest was shot.

44:41.375 --> 44:44.333
St. Josephine's Parish.

44:47.709 --> 44:49.250
(sighs)

44:49.333 --> 44:52.750
I know about your brother
Brendan's settlement.

44:52.834 --> 44:54.750
$1.4 million.

44:54.834 --> 44:55.917
Oh, yeah?

44:58.458 --> 45:00.375
They target families
like yours.

45:03.667 --> 45:06.000
The mother's sick,
the father's absent.

45:15.875 --> 45:18.250
What about Terry?

45:20.375 --> 45:21.375
Did that priest abuse him, too?

45:21.458 --> 45:24.333
Leave Terry out of it.

45:24.417 --> 45:27.291
They don't stop at one kid.

45:27.375 --> 45:29.208
They move from one
to the other.

45:29.291 --> 45:31.166
What about you, Ray?

45:31.250 --> 45:33.500
(gasps)

45:36.500 --> 45:38.583
(Kate moaning)

45:57.000 --> 45:58.083
(panting)

46:02.250 --> 46:04.125
(groans softly)

46:08.500 --> 46:10.583
(moaning)

46:22.500 --> 46:24.166
Did he get you, too?

46:24.250 --> 46:28.333
Shut up.

46:28.417 --> 46:30.834
Did he fuck you up
like he fucked up your brother?

46:30.917 --> 46:32.041
(gasps)

46:36.125 --> 46:37.333
(groans)

46:37.417 --> 46:38.750
(shrieks)

46:38.834 --> 46:39.959
(both grunting)

46:43.458 --> 46:46.291
(crying)

46:46.375 --> 46:47.709
Ray!

46:47.792 --> 46:48.917
(grunting)

46:50.875 --> 46:53.709
(gasping)

46:53.792 --> 46:56.166
(coughing)
(sighs)

46:58.208 --> 47:00.291
(crying)

47:02.291 --> 47:04.375
Fuck.

47:09.208 --> 47:11.041
(crying)

47:30.000 --> 47:31.125
(phone chimes)

47:49.542 --> 47:51.166
(phone cmes)

48:18.291 --> 48:20.250
I'll fucking do it.

48:24.625 --> 48:25.625
(phone ringing)

48:25.709 --> 48:26.583
Hello?

48:26.667 --> 48:30.166
TERRY:
Frances?

48:30.250 --> 48:30.792
Are you okay?

48:30.875 --> 48:34.917
We're going to Ireland.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.625
What are you talking about?

48:36.709 --> 48:38.291
It's all gonna work out.
I'm gonna get the money.

48:38.375 --> 48:40.500
How?

48:40.583 --> 48:42.458
Don't worry about it.

48:48.250 --> 48:50.375
You know I love you.

48:51.834 --> 48:53.917
Terry?

49:00.542 --> 49:02.041
(sighs)

49:03.250 --> 49:06.750
A good team trusts each other.
That's all you have to know.

49:06.834 --> 49:09.583
If you got any
questions, ask them.

49:09.667 --> 49:12.083
Terry. Terry.

49:12.166 --> 49:12.792
Ronald, this is

49:12.875 --> 49:15.500
my son Ter.
CHERRY: Hi.

49:15.583 --> 49:17.333
MICKEY: He's, uh... he's
gonna be our muscle.

49:17.417 --> 49:19.041
Muscle?

49:19.125 --> 49:21.625
He's shaking like a leaf.
How's he gonna do anything?

49:21.709 --> 49:24.208
Well, you want to find out?

49:24.291 --> 49:25.291
Oh, you don't want
fucking none of this.

49:25.375 --> 49:27.875
Now, listen, if I say
he's gonna be our muscle,

49:27.959 --> 49:31.125
he's gonna be
our fucking muscle.

49:31.208 --> 49:32.291
Who's this guy?

49:32.375 --> 49:35.750
He's my parole officer.

49:35.834 --> 49:38.375
Jesus, Mick,
are you fucking crazy?

49:38.458 --> 49:40.542
Now... we're just
going over the plans.

49:40.625 --> 49:42.208
Close the door, Ter.

49:48.417 --> 49:50.542
MICKEY:
All right.

49:50.625 --> 49:52.792
Everybody look at each other.

49:52.875 --> 49:55.208
And Mr. Cochran
has a band.

49:55.291 --> 49:56.291
Oh?

49:56.375 --> 49:57.625
Eddie and
The Undercovers.

49:57.709 --> 49:58.959
That is such
a clever name.

49:59.041 --> 50:00.875
Mr. Cochran? Call me Ed, please.

50:00.959 --> 50:03.458
What kind of music do you play?

50:03.542 --> 50:04.792
Classic rock.

50:04.875 --> 50:07.083
We do not go past 1979,

50:07.166 --> 50:09.875
mostly because music stopped
being good after that.

50:09.959 --> 50:10.583
(laughter)
WOMAN: I know!
Didn't it?

50:10.667 --> 50:12.792
Yes, it did.

50:12.875 --> 50:14.542
And you, Mrs. Cochran,
are you musical?

50:14.625 --> 50:16.625
Oh, I'm just a fan.

50:16.709 --> 50:17.583
But I really love
to dance.

50:17.667 --> 50:19.875
Me, too.
Ooh.

50:19.959 --> 50:21.917
(laughter)

50:22.000 --> 50:23.834
Well, you should come with us
some time and watch him play.

50:23.917 --> 50:26.333
Tommy, what are
you doing here?

50:28.750 --> 50:30.083
(people gasping)

50:30.166 --> 50:31.208
Tommy.

50:31.917 --> 50:34.083
DONNA (crying):
Oh, my God.

50:34.166 --> 50:36.208
Please, no.

50:39.333 --> 50:40.166
No.

50:43.333 --> 50:45.375
(people screaming)

50:45.458 --> 50:48.291
Oh...

50:51.041 --> 50:52.208
(Abby and Jim moaning)

51:04.792 --> 51:05.709
Oh! Oh!

51:05.792 --> 51:07.291
(moaning loudly)

51:11.291 --> 51:12.375
Yes. Mmm.
