WEBVTT

03:20.173 --> 03:21.509
What do you have for us?

03:21.551 --> 03:25.179
I think I may have found
something of interest.

03:27.847 --> 03:29.723
Look at this.

03:30.976 --> 03:34.480
Some say she is an abomination
of nature.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.772
Carnival freaks?

03:36.814 --> 03:38.899
Julius, don’t waste our time.

03:39.484 --> 03:41.694
Yes, sir.
What can I get for you?

03:41.735 --> 03:42.986
A glass of absinthe.

03:43.818 --> 03:45.112
Right away, sir.

03:45.948 --> 03:48.117
Flame it, and make sure
the glass is clean.

03:48.283 --> 03:49.536
Yes, sir.

04:01.753 --> 04:03.297
I like you Brimstone people.

04:03.339 --> 04:05.382
You never make a mess of the place.

04:05.882 --> 04:10.219
This woman-
What have you heard?

04:10.261 --> 04:14.974
What might only be
the tall tales of drunks.

04:16.015 --> 04:19.435
This person has tricks
that go beyond the things...

04:19.935 --> 04:22.480
normal people can do.

04:23.023 --> 04:27.443
Come on, folks! Come on!

04:28.194 --> 04:30.613
The amazing Amanda!

04:33.992 --> 04:35.367
Yes!

04:37.203 --> 04:39.119
Step right up!

04:39.120 --> 04:42.039
See the freak of all freaks!

04:42.164 --> 04:43.917
Ladies and gentlemen...

04:43.959 --> 04:49.338
I give you the beautiful Rayne!

04:49.881 --> 04:54.967
A creature so sensitive to water...

04:56.262 --> 04:59.474
the very touch of it...

05:01.099 --> 05:03.685
burns her skin!

05:05.310 --> 05:06.896
Now-

05:12.025 --> 05:13.986
Painful.

05:14.028 --> 05:16.280
So look on.

05:18.573 --> 05:22.535
You are about to witness
a horrifying spectacle!

05:27.163 --> 05:31.168
Look! Look at that!
Look at that!

05:43.220 --> 05:49.183
Her skin is healed!

05:49.225 --> 05:51.977
Look! The miracle!

05:52.019 --> 05:54.688
Look! The monster!

06:07.743 --> 06:10.245
Inside.

06:23.590 --> 06:24.882
Your fee.

06:26.218 --> 06:29.554
How long do you think
it will take to get there?

06:33.683 --> 06:39.479
Rayne, are you all right?

06:39.855 --> 06:42.651
I’m working on a plan
to get us out of here.

06:42.691 --> 06:44.734
My uncle-He’s a sailor...

06:45.026 --> 06:48.906
and he once told me of a place
where people play all day...

06:49.073 --> 06:52.449
and the trees grow fruits
in every color of the rainbow...

06:52.616 --> 06:55.911
and the sunsets
set the whole sky on fire.

06:56.747 --> 06:58.998
Doesn’t it sound wonderful, Rayne?

06:59.665 --> 07:02.209
He’ll send for us soon.
I know it.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.879
Until then,
keep this close to you...

07:11.092 --> 07:12.343
for protection.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.930
Good night, my friend.

07:36.406 --> 07:38.325
Good evening, Master Kagan.

07:38.366 --> 07:40.327
Domastir, how does the night find you?

07:40.911 --> 07:44.247
I have some disconcerting news.

07:44.288 --> 07:45.331
Out with it.

07:45.414 --> 07:48.167
There was an incident of blood rage
at the Sherban Carnival.

07:48.585 --> 07:52.212
A dhamphir.
Ayoung woman.

07:57.008 --> 07:58.259
Where is the girl?

07:58.927 --> 08:00.846
There is no girl.

08:02.306 --> 08:04.472
- We’ll find her.
- No.

08:07.725 --> 08:10.731
Then she is alive, the little one
who slipped through my fingers.

08:11.229 --> 08:14.608
You must find her.
She poses a threat to my plans.

08:14.650 --> 08:17.235
Send out your best spies, Domastir.

08:17.276 --> 08:18.986
Master Kagan.

09:15.829 --> 09:16.872
Lay still.

10:02.622 --> 10:04.499
Get away!

10:50.499 --> 10:53.836
Kagan is building an army of thralls,
and we’re on our way to a carnival.

10:54.544 --> 10:58.547
Am I the only one
who thinks this is madness? Katarin?

10:58.589 --> 11:01.675
Then how do you suggest
we deal with this army, Sebastian?

11:02.970 --> 11:06.387
Brimstone is a shadow
of its former self.

11:06.805 --> 11:10.434
I have yet to see the point
in finding this carnival.

11:10.643 --> 11:15.229
Listen, you two, when has a vampire
ever been held in captivity...

11:15.230 --> 11:17.439
let alone by a circus troupe?

11:17.481 --> 11:20.567
- She may be the one.
- You’re focusing your energies on Kagan.

11:20.568 --> 11:22.402
This is what I’ve decided to do.

11:22.528 --> 11:25.573
Haven’t we wasted enough time
with fairy tales?

11:57.309 --> 12:01.355
This is the work of a young vampire
out of control.

12:04.566 --> 12:08.027
- Blood rage.
- Or, perhaps, a young dhamphir.

12:08.529 --> 12:09.946
We have work to do.

12:38.181 --> 12:39.181
Sit still.

12:44.395 --> 12:46.313
Did you see who it was
that bit you?

12:51.609 --> 12:54.236
Rayne, take my sword.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.584
I didn’t see anything.
I don’t even remember what happened.

13:11.625 --> 13:15.131
You were bitten by a vampire, and you
don’t remember anything that happened?

13:15.172 --> 13:17.424
- We should kill her now.
- Please.

13:17.549 --> 13:20.510
She didn’t mean to bite me.
She’s not a vampire.

13:20.593 --> 13:23.680
She was wearing a crucifix
I gave her when it happened.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.265
She is my friend.

13:38.444 --> 13:39.903
We have more work to do.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.197
We passed a small village
not too far back.

13:43.531 --> 13:47.159
I will see if I can find her hiding there.
With your permission.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.661
Yeah.

13:52.455 --> 13:57.002
If she’s what I think she is, we’re
likely not the only ones looking for her.

14:24.819 --> 14:26.445
You requested me, Viscount.

14:27.988 --> 14:30.031
I have a message for my daughter.

14:32.409 --> 14:33.910
Dearest Katarin-

14:37.163 --> 14:38.288
All right, Katarin.

14:40.624 --> 14:43.042
Although we’ve had our differences
in the past...

14:43.586 --> 14:47.298
I beseech you now
to put away all grudges...

14:47.423 --> 14:49.257
for the good of humanity.

14:49.423 --> 14:51.760
It pains me to admit...

14:51.843 --> 14:55.930
that our beloved but weakened
Brimstone Society...

14:56.012 --> 14:57.932
can no longer defeat Kagan...

14:58.391 --> 15:03.103
yet he must not be allowed to acquire
Beliar’s artifacts nor legacy.

15:03.104 --> 15:07.023
Thus I turn to you, my daughter...

15:07.357 --> 15:10.025
to help me protect...

15:10.066 --> 15:12.570
the souls of this land.

15:14.489 --> 15:18.493
You and I are the only ones
who know what is hidden...

15:18.534 --> 15:22.412
in Brimstone Fortress-
its value, its importance.

15:22.745 --> 15:25.498
I need you to bring
this artifact to me.

15:25.874 --> 15:29.252
It must be protected from those
who wish to use it to undermine me.

15:30.210 --> 15:31.088
Scratch that.

15:31.170 --> 15:36.634
To undermine freedom
and humanity.

15:37.010 --> 15:39.385
And together we will stop
this madness...

15:39.468 --> 15:41.804
and bring peace to these lands.

15:41.846 --> 15:45.142
Your beloved father,
et cetera, et cetera.

15:45.266 --> 15:46.351
What do you think?

15:46.684 --> 15:49.145
A very compelling argument, master.

15:50.478 --> 15:53.106
You’re such a suck-up.

16:31.434 --> 16:32.685
Find your own meal.

16:51.826 --> 16:52.870
Keep away from us.

17:02.377 --> 17:06.174
I will not harm you.
I only wish to kill vampires.

17:18.977 --> 17:22.685
- I’m sorry about your friend.
- He was my brother.

17:23.479 --> 17:26.151
I’m sorry that
we had to leave him there.

17:27.568 --> 17:30.278
- Why did you save us?
- I don’t know.

17:30.695 --> 17:34.490
- Where is your family?
- I don’t have a family.

18:53.479 --> 18:56.524
Dhamphir, Dhamphir.

18:57.148 --> 19:00.401
Follow me. Follow me.

19:09.243 --> 19:11.162
- Got it.
- Come on.

19:12.745 --> 19:14.580
I see a journey in your future.

19:16.958 --> 19:19.253
Ajourney, perhaps, to within.

19:22.046 --> 19:25.716
Dhamphir, you don’t know, do you?

19:28.844 --> 19:31.638
- I will stand.
- I was expecting you.

19:31.972 --> 19:34.891
- There’s a reason you’re here.
- What did you call me?

19:36.602 --> 19:38.602
Most believe that your kind
are merely legends.

19:39.771 --> 19:42.440
It is rare to see a live dhamphir.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.734
Part vampire, part human.

19:45.733 --> 19:49.613
Mostly they die at birth.
Generally they are exterminated.

19:49.654 --> 19:51.865
You’ve hidden well.

19:56.702 --> 19:58.621
My tales hold some truth, I see.

19:58.788 --> 20:01.623
- There was a man.
- A man? Kagan?

20:01.706 --> 20:05.420
Kagan’s not a man. He’s a vampire.
And you are his creation.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.214
He killed my mother.

20:07.837 --> 20:11.965
Dhamphirs are rarely a product of a happy
union between a vampire and a human.

20:12.007 --> 20:13.009
You lie.

20:15.469 --> 20:17.262
Your poor mother.

20:23.977 --> 20:26.896
I will kill him.

20:28.524 --> 20:32.484
Listen to me, Dhamphir-
and this is not easy to tell you...

20:32.526 --> 20:35.821
and will likely result
in great danger for all involved-

20:35.988 --> 20:40.326
Kagan has become
the most powerful vampire...

20:40.784 --> 20:43.120
taking advantage of a land with no law.

20:43.161 --> 20:46.872
I do not care.
How do I find him?

20:48.041 --> 20:50.084
- You are naive.
- Tell me.

20:51.169 --> 20:54.381
He resides in a guarded castle
beyond the dark mountains...

20:54.423 --> 20:56.464
but there are no safe entrances.

20:56.465 --> 20:57.465
But...

20:59.218 --> 21:00.887
there is an ancient talisman...

21:01.303 --> 21:04.056
an eye that Kagan seeks.

21:04.097 --> 21:08.267
If you possess it,
you will certainly get an audience.

21:08.309 --> 21:11.811
- Why do you tell me this?
- Because it’s my purpose...

21:11.812 --> 21:13.648
and the prophecy.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.024
They say this Talisman of the Eye...

21:16.108 --> 21:19.777
is kept in the Solambria Monastery
to the south.

21:19.861 --> 21:24.241
Be careful, my child. The Eye
is far more than a mere trinket.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.742
The talisman holds great power...

21:26.785 --> 21:28.953
but it’s important
that you move quickly.

21:28.995 --> 21:33.415
You will be doing the entire world
a great service keeping this from Kagan.

21:33.457 --> 21:38.004
I’m not interested in the world.
Only in Kagan.

21:38.711 --> 21:40.005
I thank you.

22:19.999 --> 22:24.003
The fortune-teller had a visitor.
This dhamphir is now in search of the Eye.

22:24.086 --> 22:26.131
Good. She can lead us to it.

22:26.172 --> 22:29.465
I highly doubt that her intent
is to deliver it to her long-lost father.

22:29.673 --> 22:33.762
Kill her. Let her find the Eye
or let her try, then kill her.

22:34.346 --> 22:36.724
A dhamphir should be no match for you.

22:55.406 --> 22:58.826
Your suspicion was correct.
Domastir’s on the move.

24:15.062 --> 24:16.689
What is it, my child?

24:16.730 --> 24:18.899
I have been separated from my family...

24:18.941 --> 24:22.401
and have been traveling for three days
and nights without food or sleep.

24:22.485 --> 24:25.402
May I seek solace in your monastery
for a night’s rest?

24:25.403 --> 24:27.803
Please come in, my child.
Welcome to the Solambria Monastery.

24:43.671 --> 24:46.507
Enjoy your food,
and then you may rest.

24:46.591 --> 24:47.591
Thank you.

29:18.003 --> 29:20.254
I suggest you follow me.

29:42.151 --> 29:44.193
You’re not one of Kagan’s, are you?

29:44.485 --> 29:47.404
No. I mean you no harm...

29:47.529 --> 29:48.865
but I must leave now.

29:48.990 --> 29:50.951
I’m sorry.
You cannot leave.

29:51.742 --> 29:53.994
It seems that you absorbed the Eye.

29:55.328 --> 29:58.581
Our order has been guarding it
for centuries.

30:02.918 --> 30:04.337
Why do you protect it?

30:05.588 --> 30:07.839
Because the Eye holds powers.

30:08.383 --> 30:10.969
Why do you think water
no longer burns you?

30:11.969 --> 30:16.431
There are three talismans-
an eye, a rib and a heart.

30:17.014 --> 30:20.810
They all belonged to a long-dead
vampire named Beliar.

30:21.354 --> 30:26.398
He discovered a method to defy
those elements that destroy vampires-

30:26.566 --> 30:30.651
water, sunlight and a cross.

30:31.404 --> 30:33.571
When he was finally defeated...

30:33.779 --> 30:36.033
his body was quickly dismembered...

30:36.200 --> 30:39.243
and parts of it were hidden
all over the lands...

30:39.702 --> 30:41.663
out of the reach of vampires.

30:42.122 --> 30:44.039
If they become united again...

30:44.624 --> 30:49.378
they could make a vampire
powerful enough to control the world.

30:49.544 --> 30:51.672
Beliar’s not my concern.

30:51.964 --> 30:54.966
My mission is my own
and not of evil intent.

30:55.008 --> 30:56.717
You are a vampire...

30:57.718 --> 31:00.720
yet you are immune to the cross.

31:01.637 --> 31:03.056
I am a dhamphir.

31:03.641 --> 31:06.727
So Kagan’s own offspring
is his enemy?

31:07.353 --> 31:08.812
How is it you know about me?

31:08.895 --> 31:11.855
There has been talk for years
that Kagan was in search...

31:12.065 --> 31:13.817
of a prodigious child.

31:14.692 --> 31:16.986
His bloodline is strong enough
to produce one.

31:17.903 --> 31:20.156
He is our biggest threat.

31:20.448 --> 31:22.784
He has an army of thralls-

31:23.283 --> 31:27.494
humans who choose to work for him
rather than die.

31:27.829 --> 31:31.249
And they can do things
vampires cannot.

31:31.708 --> 31:35.587
Now you understand why
I cannot let you leave with the Eye.

31:36.753 --> 31:39.465
Father! Father!
The monastery’s being attacked!

32:17.208 --> 32:18.752
Don’t let Kagan get the Eye.

33:45.496 --> 33:46.496
Where’s the Eye?

33:52.710 --> 33:54.087
You fool.

33:57.756 --> 33:59.175
Kill her.

35:00.021 --> 35:01.898
Hurry! Let’s go!

35:19.623 --> 35:23.667
He’s taking her to Kagan’s.
You must go back to Brimstone.

35:23.751 --> 35:26.963
Put them on full alert that
the monastery has been attacked...

35:27.172 --> 35:28.549
and the Eye is gone.

35:47.272 --> 35:48.273
Brimstone.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.457
Come closer.

36:14.256 --> 36:15.924
Don’t be afraid.

37:15.936 --> 37:19.272
- Leonid’s lair.
- Why would Domastir bring her here?

37:19.356 --> 37:21.650
Perhaps she needs to feed,
or the sun.

37:21.691 --> 37:24.820
Now that she has the Eye,
we must capture her.

37:24.903 --> 37:28.489
Bring her back to Brimstone
before it’s too late.

37:46.882 --> 37:50.467
Domastir, Domastir,
why do you come here...

37:50.551 --> 37:55.223
and insult my palace
with your stench?

37:55.306 --> 37:57.308
I need shelter till nightfall.

38:17.700 --> 38:20.453
Is that a gift you’ve laid
at my feet, Domastir?

38:21.163 --> 38:24.248
How delightful.

38:24.332 --> 38:26.500
No, Leonid, she is Kagan’s.

38:31.046 --> 38:39.046
Kagan, the mightiest...

38:39.762 --> 38:44.184
of all vampires.

38:48.687 --> 38:50.773
Funny, Domastir.

38:54.692 --> 38:56.403
I do not see him.

39:09.165 --> 39:10.999
Yes.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.544
She’ll make a fine addition
to my collection.

39:15.545 --> 39:17.796
Touch her and your fingers are gone!

39:19.883 --> 39:22.343
Such a dedicated peon.

39:24.262 --> 39:25.595
Fine. Take her, then.

39:25.678 --> 39:29.349
I have more than enough...

39:29.433 --> 39:32.811
to satisfy my needs.

39:41.443 --> 39:44.069
But none with an eye like that.

39:45.696 --> 39:47.407
She stays.

39:47.448 --> 39:49.325
Remove him.

40:17.099 --> 40:18.099
Help me.

40:18.185 --> 40:19.185
Cut it.

40:33.199 --> 40:36.618
Where did you acquire such a gem?

40:36.786 --> 40:38.288
Give it to me...

40:38.329 --> 40:42.040
and I will let you live.

40:42.207 --> 40:43.583
Give it to me.

40:52.757 --> 40:55.927
You have the Eye!
You give it to me!

40:56.470 --> 41:00.597
Give it to me,
or I’ll rip it out of your face!

41:32.586 --> 41:34.796
So we meet again.

41:35.089 --> 41:38.799
Vladimir, I’ve always admired your spirit.
It’s a shame you must die.

41:40.968 --> 41:43.096
You fool, Vladimir!

41:53.605 --> 41:55.690
The Eye. The Eye!

42:17.711 --> 42:20.129
Let’s get her out.

42:49.031 --> 42:51.157
How can you be certain
she’ll be useful to us?

42:51.199 --> 42:55.285
She has already been useful.
She stopped Kagan from getting the Eye.

42:55.286 --> 42:57.245
- Yes, Vladimir, but-
- Listen.

42:57.287 --> 43:00.247
I’ve been hunting vampires
since before you were born...

43:01.626 --> 43:06.672
and there was always one
that I suspected, or hoped, existed.

43:06.714 --> 43:09.131
We have to consider
what she is, Vladimir.

43:09.799 --> 43:13.218
If she was simply a vampire,
crossing the water would kill her.

43:13.343 --> 43:15.846
And there’s also that...

43:16.388 --> 43:19.433
which most vampires
are not fond of having.

43:19.851 --> 43:21.477
Where are you taking me?

43:21.518 --> 43:23.198
You should be grateful you’re still alive.

43:23.562 --> 43:27.607
We helped each other.
I do not need you anymore.

43:30.860 --> 43:32.987
I should skin you
and hang you on display.

43:33.361 --> 43:37.283
- Where’s the Eye?
- It has somehow become a part of her.

43:37.532 --> 43:39.242
It has assimilated.

43:39.409 --> 43:41.077
She must be brought to me alive.

43:41.161 --> 43:44.163
Leave me.
I’ll send further instructions.

43:45.040 --> 43:49.126
Does she have a name, the dhamphir?

43:49.252 --> 43:51.795
I have heard she is called Rayne.

43:52.254 --> 43:53.254
Rayne?

43:58.928 --> 44:00.220
What is this place?

44:00.262 --> 44:03.891
Welcome to the headquarters
of the Brimstone Society.

44:15.151 --> 44:16.942
All in good reason, I hope.

44:17.443 --> 44:20.613
There was a messenger killed
in the monastery.

44:29.622 --> 44:32.665
Master, the talisman has arrived.

44:34.458 --> 44:35.458
Excellent.

44:38.045 --> 44:40.880
This dhamphir’s inconsequential.

44:40.922 --> 44:43.425
It’s Kagan you should be interested in.

44:43.759 --> 44:46.554
There was a Brimstone in Rome.

44:47.096 --> 44:50.181
It has been completely annihilated.

44:50.264 --> 44:51.432
And that’s not all.

44:52.767 --> 44:54.103
Kagan has the Rib.

44:55.645 --> 44:56.854
Release me.

44:59.316 --> 45:01.485
What would make us think
that you won’t attack?

45:01.526 --> 45:02.526
I told you...

45:03.902 --> 45:05.986
I do not thirst for human blood.

45:06.780 --> 45:11.994
If you have live animals here-
rats, even-

45:12.077 --> 45:15.120
I will regain my strength quickly
and be on my way.

45:15.246 --> 45:16.331
I don’t trust her.

45:16.414 --> 45:19.084
I want what you want-

45:19.584 --> 45:22.003
to bring Kagan to ruin.

45:22.460 --> 45:25.797
I speak the truth.
He raped my mother...

45:26.840 --> 45:30.677
and murdered her
in front of my own eyes.

46:43.618 --> 46:45.035
Where is she?

46:52.794 --> 46:54.921
- Where is the girl?
- There is no girl.

47:21.401 --> 47:22.944
I will find her.

48:00.647 --> 48:02.732
Sometimes
we must have faith in others.

48:04.107 --> 48:07.026
I believe you know that it’s useless
to fight Kagan alone.

48:07.611 --> 48:10.405
If you wish, you’re welcome
to stay here and train with us.

48:10.406 --> 48:11.532
Thank you.

48:14.367 --> 48:15.575
May I have my swords?

48:17.703 --> 48:19.789
All in good time.

48:19.955 --> 48:21.957
Give her what she needs.

48:37.305 --> 48:39.390
Yes, Katarin?

48:39.431 --> 48:43.185
What lies ahead? Will you be
opening up the gates to the thralls?

48:45.270 --> 48:46.519
That’s ridiculous.

48:46.520 --> 48:48.273
I am loyal to you, Vladimir...

48:48.315 --> 48:51.316
yet you’re breaking the very laws
and teachings you swore by.

48:51.776 --> 48:53.861
Your newfound faith scares me.

48:54.194 --> 48:56.865
What will happen to Brimstone
in the event of battle?

48:57.698 --> 48:59.409
I don’t have all the answers.

49:01.952 --> 49:03.910
We’re growing weak.

49:18.800 --> 49:19.842
Come on!

49:31.270 --> 49:32.187
Control.

49:32.228 --> 49:35.189
Physical strength without control
means nothing.

49:35.232 --> 49:38.235
Once again, from the beginning.

50:54.929 --> 50:56.888
They belonged to a friend.

50:57.056 --> 51:00.225
I know someone
that might be able to help.

51:12.821 --> 51:16.323
Our seamstress has prepared
some clothing.

51:16.490 --> 51:17.909
I hope they’re to your liking.

51:23.205 --> 51:24.539
Are you all right?

51:26.083 --> 51:31.044
Ever since I got here, there are
these noises that persist in my head.

51:32.838 --> 51:34.591
I’m sure there’s some reason for that.

51:34.631 --> 51:35.758
I don’t know.

51:36.509 --> 51:38.427
If you’re feeling up to it...

51:38.844 --> 51:41.597
you’re more than welcome
to join us for dinner.

51:42.096 --> 51:45.641
I don’t think the food you have there
will be of interest to me.

51:46.767 --> 51:51.814
You act as though
you’re the only one who feels pain.

51:51.856 --> 51:53.649
What do you know of pain?

51:54.525 --> 51:56.151
My father’s Kagan.

51:56.402 --> 51:59.238
My mother was killed
before my own eyes.

52:04.951 --> 52:08.330
My mother and father
were both killed...

52:09.871 --> 52:11.707
by Vladimir.

52:12.541 --> 52:15.751
They had turned,
and I was to be slaughtered.

52:16.672 --> 52:20.466
Had he not arrived,
I would not be here today.

54:51.228 --> 54:52.228
Your food.

54:52.770 --> 54:55.146
What, are we sitting
at the table of the children?

54:56.105 --> 54:57.859
We’re running out of food.

54:58.316 --> 55:01.154
We have to go to the mainland
and get supplies.

55:01.779 --> 55:03.571
No. It’s not a good idea.

55:03.613 --> 55:06.949
- We’ll have to make do with what we have.
- We have to eat.

55:16.833 --> 55:20.086
Perhaps your savior
can multiply our supplies.

55:24.673 --> 55:27.258
Welcome.
Won’t you come sit with us?

55:38.477 --> 55:41.148
It seems you’ve become very popular.

55:41.481 --> 55:45.109
I think you’ve breathed
some new hope into the Society.

55:45.734 --> 55:49.239
- This surprises you?
- I thought they would be afraid of me.

55:49.322 --> 55:51.698
They only fear what they do not know.

55:53.074 --> 55:54.992
Can I see your teeth?

55:56.453 --> 55:57.788
Darius.

55:59.122 --> 56:01.039
So you’re satisfied
with your new clothing?

56:01.999 --> 56:03.875
Yes. Thank you.

56:15.344 --> 56:16.553
Father...

56:17.638 --> 56:20.224
in the days since
I received your letter...

56:20.433 --> 56:24.601
I have come to see certain truths
that now give me pause.

56:24.896 --> 56:27.439
I believe that you are right.

56:27.857 --> 56:30.734
Brimstone is lost.

56:31.150 --> 56:33.737
Be sure this message arrives.

56:33.987 --> 56:36.989
- It is of grave importance.
- Yes, Katarin.

56:52.462 --> 56:54.381
The spoils of Rome.

56:54.839 --> 56:56.924
Only one Brimstone remains.

56:57.550 --> 56:59.051
Bring me my thralls.

57:02.345 --> 57:05.973
The time has come to fulfiill your oaths,
my loyal thralls.

57:05.974 --> 57:08.936
Scour the land.
Find Brimstone and destroy it.

57:08.978 --> 57:12.728
Bring the dhamphir to me.
Leave no human alive that crosses you.

57:12.729 --> 57:15.650
The promise of eternal life
awaits those who succeed.

57:15.692 --> 57:18.235
Those who fail will find only death.

57:25.658 --> 57:28.663
- Nice form.
- Finally we agree on something.

57:31.873 --> 57:34.624
Vladimir needs you.
He’s in the courtyard.

57:35.625 --> 57:36.625
Good match.

57:38.087 --> 57:40.006
Until we duel again.

57:45.050 --> 57:46.050
You duel?

57:47.179 --> 57:48.428
A little.

57:59.272 --> 58:02.609
Your form is weak.
You’re lacking passion.

58:02.943 --> 58:05.945
It’s part of my plan.
I am tiring you out.

58:05.986 --> 58:08.322
Your plan is lacking passion as well.

58:12.784 --> 58:14.369
I see they have taught you well.

58:15.412 --> 58:19.957
Hardly. I was trained in battle
by a great warrior...

58:20.290 --> 58:23.337
one whom has long disappeared
fighting alongside Brimstone.

58:23.379 --> 58:24.754
My father.

58:27.132 --> 58:30.759
- Where is this warrior now?
- He is now a cursed enemy.

58:31.009 --> 58:33.719
A vampire.
My loyalties lie with Vladimir...

58:33.720 --> 58:36.513
and the Brimstone
my father protected as a human.

58:37.767 --> 58:39.685
And what do your loyalties consist of?

58:39.726 --> 58:44.228
You’re a curious one. My purpose
is to fulfill my father’s will-

58:44.312 --> 58:46.231
killing the very thing he’s become.

58:49.610 --> 58:52.612
It seems all this chatter
has veered me from the task at hand.

58:53.529 --> 58:55.489
You should pay more attention.

58:58.452 --> 59:01.787
Keep your friends close,
enemies even closer.

59:01.871 --> 59:04.372
Vladimir taught me that.

59:05.918 --> 59:08.543
We shall continue this later.

59:21.264 --> 59:24.476
Good evening, Viscount.
Kagan sends his regards.

59:27.853 --> 59:32.231
I assume you were expecting this message
from Brimstone from Katarin?

59:34.191 --> 59:36.068
Would you stop throwing things at me?

59:37.152 --> 59:41.531
You know, Elrick, Kagan has
little patience for ambitious vampires...

59:41.823 --> 59:44.075
especially those that were once Brimstone.

59:44.285 --> 59:46.327
Can a vampire not receive word
from his own daughter...

59:46.369 --> 59:49.161
without being cast as a rebel
in search of power?

59:49.288 --> 59:51.874
- Is that the plan?
- Plans are for humans.

59:52.875 --> 59:54.555
I think destiny
is a more appropriate term.

59:54.710 --> 59:58.463
Where is Brimstone? Tell me now,
or suffer the consequences.

59:58.505 --> 01:00:01.466
Even you must sense
that change is upon us.

01:00:01.758 --> 01:00:03.967
This land has become unsettled.

01:00:04.427 --> 01:00:07.555
The future must be held
in the hands of human-born...

01:00:07.722 --> 01:00:09.432
and vampire-perfected.

01:00:10.809 --> 01:00:13.018
That is an invitation, by the way.

01:00:14.562 --> 01:00:17.690
Spare Katarin, unseat Kagan...

01:00:18.023 --> 01:00:23.570
and join me in a, shall we say,
more colorful reign.

01:00:25.071 --> 01:00:28.407
Kagan’s gratitude or Kagan’s wrath.

01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:30.242
Now, where’s Brimstone?

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.786
You honestly expect me...

01:00:33.871 --> 01:00:35.623
to betray my daughter?

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.415
You know, it’s funny.

01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:40.294
You never struck me
as the paternal type.

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:41.920
Now, get me the map.

01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:45.924
Give us our destiny.

01:00:46.757 --> 01:00:49.677
We leave now,
and that will be the end of it.

01:00:50.134 --> 01:00:52.471
You should travel with Sebastian.

01:00:54.682 --> 01:00:57.101
Is there something
you want to speak about?

01:00:59.893 --> 01:01:01.729
You should not travel with her.

01:01:01.854 --> 01:01:05.316
She’s a danger to you.
Kagan is surely out looking for her.

01:01:05.649 --> 01:01:09.319
You’re an important part
of the Brimstone Society.

01:01:09.819 --> 01:01:12.572
Your work defending the fortress...

01:01:12.739 --> 01:01:15.450
is essential to
our struggle and survival.

01:01:16.032 --> 01:01:19.413
And no one has ever questioned that.

01:01:19.455 --> 01:01:21.581
I am not seeking praises.

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:25.251
- I seek to feel secure.
- You are a leader.

01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:26.712
Rayne is a fighter.

01:01:27.211 --> 01:01:30.089
I will take Sebastian if it pleases you.

01:01:50.191 --> 01:01:52.526
Iancu’s been a friend for many years...

01:01:52.818 --> 01:01:55.027
and a defender of the Society.

01:01:57.113 --> 01:01:59.699
We’re very fortunate to have him.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.204
Iancu has visitors.

01:02:08.039 --> 01:02:10.125
Come for some chops, have you?

01:02:14.212 --> 01:02:15.797
We’ll be downstairs.

01:02:22.887 --> 01:02:25.765
Watch your step.
It’s a long way down.

01:02:26.056 --> 01:02:28.057
Your kind of place.

01:02:42.237 --> 01:02:43.905
Domastir.

01:02:46.576 --> 01:02:48.284
We must move quickly.

01:02:54.915 --> 01:02:55.999
What are those?

01:02:58.252 --> 01:03:01.255
Black powder from China.

01:03:02.297 --> 01:03:03.672
We will take them.

01:03:06.885 --> 01:03:08.677
Is everything ready?

01:03:10.555 --> 01:03:12.347
Take anything else you need.

01:03:13.181 --> 01:03:15.100
Holy water.

01:03:31.615 --> 01:03:34.285
- A gift from Brimstone.
- Thank you.

01:04:17.698 --> 01:04:20.493
Brimstone’s attacked.
They’re all dead.

01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:25.621
- That’s not possible.
- It was Domastir and the thralls.

01:04:27.916 --> 01:04:30.168
Are there any survivors?

01:04:31.879 --> 01:04:34.421
You can’t go back.
There’s too many.

01:04:34.839 --> 01:04:38.801
- They came looking for you.
- How did they find us?

01:04:41.137 --> 01:04:43.097
I have dressings for his wounds.

01:04:49.311 --> 01:04:50.936
This doesn’t feel right.

01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:56.149
- How would they know?
- This is what Kagan wants.

01:04:56.398 --> 01:04:59.655
To lure back
what’s left of Brimstone to him...

01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:01.864
so he can destroy us
once and for all.

01:05:01.906 --> 01:05:04.908
Domastir will pay with his life for this.

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:08.077
If they want a fight,
a fight they will get.

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:15.335
It was Katarin.

01:05:15.752 --> 01:05:18.378
You must choose.
Bargain for freedom...

01:05:18.586 --> 01:05:21.630
or leave your children motherless
as a Brimstone martyr.

01:05:21.757 --> 01:05:22.757
Never!

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:27.513
She’s turned.

01:05:40.066 --> 01:05:41.149
He’s dead.

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:19.892
- Just let me go.
- I can’t.

01:06:20.225 --> 01:06:22.019
- You will.
- Where are you going?

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:24.063
I’m going on my own.

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:28.108
Everyone who comes near me dies.

01:06:28.191 --> 01:06:30.527
They came looking for me and the Eye.

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:33.990
None of those people had to die.
You too will be dead if I stay with you.

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:37.784
- You don’t have to do this.
- I’m going to find the Heart.

01:06:37.909 --> 01:06:41.663
With two of the talismans,
I will stand a chance against Kagan.

01:06:41.788 --> 01:06:44.415
How do you expect to find the Heart?

01:06:44.707 --> 01:06:46.834
I can hear it.

01:06:48.377 --> 01:06:50.503
Good-bye, Sebastian.

01:06:52.464 --> 01:06:56.676
Just wait. Wait.
Stop. Here.

01:06:59.012 --> 01:07:01.304
You can wear this with pride.

01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:04.223
Please?

01:07:08.394 --> 01:07:09.897
And here.

01:07:12.524 --> 01:07:14.652
This will protect you.

01:08:30.469 --> 01:08:34.596
Sir, we’ve searched the entire grounds.
There’s no sign of the dhamphir.

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:39.228
She is not amongst the dead either, sir.

01:08:39.645 --> 01:08:42.313
Perhaps she was never here.

01:08:46.776 --> 01:08:50.779
We must return to Kagan.
She could be on her way there now.

01:08:51.238 --> 01:08:53.948
- Prepare the boats!
- Yes, sir.

01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:19.180
The Heart.

01:09:29.856 --> 01:09:32.233
Perhaps there’s some truth
to this prophecy after all.

01:09:32.441 --> 01:09:35.278
Even if she has the Heart,
she can’t face Kagan alone.

01:09:52.252 --> 01:09:53.502
Nothing yet.

01:09:53.836 --> 01:09:56.839
- Are you certain that it’s down there?
- Are you questioning me?

01:09:56.965 --> 01:09:58.925
My grandfather placed it there.

01:09:58.967 --> 01:10:01.052
I would not risk all on folktales.

01:10:01.176 --> 01:10:02.969
Why did we let the others die?

01:10:03.553 --> 01:10:06.474
It was them or all of us.

01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:11.687
We sacrifice animals to survive.
Brimstone is no different.

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.898
I will kneel before no one...

01:10:13.939 --> 01:10:17.357
nor will I sit here under
Vladimir’s command and await death.

01:10:18.775 --> 01:10:21.655
I will not allow Kagan
to take away our freedom.

01:10:22.363 --> 01:10:24.531
The Heart will go to my father.

01:10:24.907 --> 01:10:28.868
And if you want to live, you will
secure the entrance until I return.

01:10:29.327 --> 01:10:30.745
Yes, Katarin.

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:40.781
She’s not coming.
It’s too late.

01:12:40.863 --> 01:12:44.241
Have faith, Sebastian.
She will be here.

01:12:53.125 --> 01:12:55.168
I am here for Kagan.

01:12:55.835 --> 01:12:57.712
What is she doing?

01:13:03.217 --> 01:13:05.761
I have brought the Heart for my father.

01:13:06.803 --> 01:13:08.680
Give it to me.
Come on.

01:13:12.935 --> 01:13:15.939
You have what you want.
Now take me to Kagan.

01:13:16.062 --> 01:13:18.605
All in good time.
Take her.

01:13:21.608 --> 01:13:23.653
Well, Sebastian...

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:28.406
I’m afraid there’s only one way in.

01:13:38.332 --> 01:13:39.374
Get in!

01:14:06.273 --> 01:14:07.273
Master.

01:14:08.734 --> 01:14:11.695
The dhamphir has come to her senses
and delivered the Heart.

01:14:12.697 --> 01:14:13.988
Excellent.

01:14:16.993 --> 01:14:19.119
- Shall I bring her in?
- No, not yet.

01:14:22.122 --> 01:14:23.247
An historic night.

01:14:25.499 --> 01:14:27.920
Prepare to witness
the beginning of a new era.

01:14:28.836 --> 01:14:30.171
Clear the room.

01:14:33.007 --> 01:14:36.634
- Clear the room!
- Thralls! Forward!

01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:38.219
March!

01:15:06.454 --> 01:15:10.122
Capture them alive.
Take them to the dungeon.

01:15:10.582 --> 01:15:11.959
To the dungeon!

01:15:23.885 --> 01:15:27.723
There may be more. Leave them
in the cell for now and scour the castle.

01:15:31.768 --> 01:15:33.978
The rats will be eating well tonight.

01:15:36.314 --> 01:15:37.815
Enjoy your stay.

01:15:39.108 --> 01:15:43.989
And you, my dear,
you will stay here until the ceremony.

01:15:44.447 --> 01:15:47.616
- I know nothing of a ceremony.
- The Eye, dhamphir.

01:15:47.783 --> 01:15:49.951
The ceremony to extract the Eye.

01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:56.707
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:15:57.916 --> 01:15:59.836
It is good to know
that you are both alive.

01:15:59.919 --> 01:16:04.340
- I fear we’re the only ones.
- What of Katarin? Is she still alive?

01:16:05.799 --> 01:16:09.595
If not, then she died with honor...

01:16:09.888 --> 01:16:13.265
fighting for her people.

01:16:14.391 --> 01:16:16.642
What do you know of this ceremony?

01:16:16.726 --> 01:16:20.520
It’s an ancient vampire ritual
created to protect the talismans...

01:16:21.145 --> 01:16:23.940
in case they fall
into the wrong hands.

01:16:24.023 --> 01:16:26.110
What will come of me?

01:16:28.529 --> 01:16:33.449
It is only a legend
said to remove the soul.

01:16:41.707 --> 01:16:43.334
Listen.

01:16:47.712 --> 01:16:50.840
I do not know
what is going to happen to me now.

01:16:50.881 --> 01:16:53.634
I hope that you know
that I am not foolish enough...

01:16:53.759 --> 01:16:57.930
to think that I’m going
to prevail against him.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:04.060
But I do not intend
to stop fighting for a second.

01:17:17.572 --> 01:17:19.950
Nor will we.

01:17:28.331 --> 01:17:29.501
Open up.

01:17:30.292 --> 01:17:31.585
And bind her hands.

01:17:35.713 --> 01:17:37.341
It is time for the ceremony.

01:17:39.593 --> 01:17:40.593
Come.

01:17:46.014 --> 01:17:50.352
- We’ve got to find a way out of here.
- Well, let’s get out then.

01:18:00.736 --> 01:18:03.113
Even in absolute defeat,
you’re still not humble.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.741
If I’m defeated
and you’re so powerful...

01:18:05.866 --> 01:18:08.454
then why must I be shackled
when surrounded by your thralls?

01:18:08.495 --> 01:18:12.247
You’re still a risk. I should thank you
now that Brimstone is eradicated...

01:18:12.330 --> 01:18:14.374
and you have so kindly
handed me the Heart.

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:17.292
I would never have believed
it would have been so easy.

01:18:18.418 --> 01:18:20.838
If you live through this,
which is unlikely...

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.800
you may remain here in my castle.

01:18:23.424 --> 01:18:27.093
I would sooner rot in your dungeon
than sit at your table.

01:18:28.511 --> 01:18:29.638
So be it.

01:18:30.556 --> 01:18:31.640
Let us begin.

01:18:32.933 --> 01:18:36.145
Thrall, my companion is gone.

01:18:36.312 --> 01:18:39.147
I don’t know
what’s become of him.

01:18:40.231 --> 01:18:42.231
Stand back.

01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:55.369
Can’t believe that worked.

01:19:05.044 --> 01:19:06.463
Savage!

01:19:09.383 --> 01:19:10.550
Please continue.

01:21:34.555 --> 01:21:36.932
This is the end of Brimstone.

01:22:24.059 --> 01:22:26.769
You have the Heart.
Give it to me.

01:22:26.853 --> 01:22:28.563
You will have to cut it from me.

01:22:28.646 --> 01:22:30.899
So be it.

01:22:43.243 --> 01:22:45.244
You’re strong, Rayne,
but not skilled enough.

01:22:45.369 --> 01:22:47.209
Give me the Heart,
and I shall spare your life.

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:50.541
I would choose death
over seeing you as my ruler.

01:22:50.624 --> 01:22:53.252
You’re interfering with fate.
With the talismans joined...

01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:55.338
vampires shall rule the earth.

01:22:55.463 --> 01:22:57.672
As if your interests are noble.

01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:04.012
For centuries, we’ve been cursed to
the shadows, slaughtered by the fearful.

01:23:04.054 --> 01:23:06.056
Have you not always longed for freedom?

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.681
You condemned me
the day you raped my mother.

01:23:08.765 --> 01:23:11.225
I will see she has vengeance.

01:23:28.993 --> 01:23:30.744
Ungrateful bitch.

01:23:50.847 --> 01:23:53.848
Choose to be human
and die like one.

01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:17.452
I will find her.

01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:04.329
- The talismans.
- I don’t care. Kagan is dead.

01:25:04.455 --> 01:25:06.122
But what about you?

01:25:06.456 --> 01:25:09.543
No! No, no.

01:25:11.003 --> 01:25:13.170
Please. Please.

01:25:13.296 --> 01:25:15.131
Please, you don’t have to leave me.

01:25:15.547 --> 01:25:17.591
It’s my time.

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.552
Kagan’s finished.
