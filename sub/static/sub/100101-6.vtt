WEBVTT

00:10.404 --> 00:12.649
Get the hell out of my house!

00:12.673 --> 00:14.751
- What?
- Son of a bitch,

00:14.775 --> 00:16.687
- get out of here! Get!
- No, no, no! It's Project Falanx.

00:16.711 --> 00:18.689
- I'm trying to save you.
- I will bash your skull in. I swear to God,

00:18.713 --> 00:19.756
I will tee off on your head!

00:19.780 --> 00:21.058
If the delta waves hit 13 hertz,

00:21.082 --> 00:23.193
- then there's no going back.
- You tell the cops.

00:23.217 --> 00:24.494
They're going to be here
any minute. They'd love to...

00:24.518 --> 00:26.029
What is...? No. What is that?

00:26.053 --> 00:27.130
No. No. No, no, no.

00:27.154 --> 00:28.632
No, no!

00:28.656 --> 00:30.968
I'm sorry.

00:30.992 --> 00:33.036
I'm sorry. It's the only way.

00:33.060 --> 00:35.105
Get off me, you lunatic!
You got to slow the deltas.

00:35.129 --> 00:36.273
I'm trying to save your life.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.574
- You got to slow the deltas.
- I'm going to

00:37.598 --> 00:38.876
- scratch your eyes out!
- You got to slow the deltas down.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.644
Come on!

00:40.668 --> 00:43.780
The kid was some
community college dropout.

00:43.804 --> 00:46.450
No record except for
some parking tickets.

00:46.474 --> 00:47.530
So, he broke in.

00:47.531 --> 00:49.242
He didn't take anything.
He wasn't armed.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.309
Except for the Taser.

00:50.333 --> 00:51.410
What was he trying to do?

00:51.434 --> 00:52.678
Well, the FBI will debrief us

00:52.702 --> 00:54.213
on his motives.
Mike says he kept trying

00:54.237 --> 00:55.948
to put a towel around his head.

00:55.972 --> 00:59.018
- Something about delta waves.
- Oh, boy.

00:59.042 --> 01:00.319
Hanson's Iran investigation

01:00.343 --> 01:02.555
is undermining public trust
in this administration

01:02.579 --> 01:06.158
and stirring up paranoid crazies
with conspiracy theories.

01:06.182 --> 01:08.227
It might be time
to put security details

01:08.251 --> 01:09.495
- on your staff.
- Yeah.

01:09.519 --> 01:11.230
I'm already into it,
much as I'm not thrilled

01:11.254 --> 01:12.532
about being followed around.

01:12.556 --> 01:14.200
But Mike's OK?

01:14.224 --> 01:16.035
Yeah, he's lucky.

01:16.059 --> 01:18.037
Just a sprained wrist from the fall.

01:18.061 --> 01:19.305
In considerably better news,

01:19.329 --> 01:21.574
the Senate Intelligence
Committee is postponing

01:21.598 --> 01:22.742
Henry and Stevie's interviews.

01:22.766 --> 01:25.811
So, is Hanson backing down?

01:25.835 --> 01:27.446
Yeah, for now.

01:27.470 --> 01:29.115
Daisy's resignation took some heat off

01:29.139 --> 01:30.483
the Iran investigation.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.817
Crappy bargain.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.053
Well, this isn't
over by any means,

01:34.077 --> 01:35.488
but we do have some breathing room.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.691
We can nominate Rachel Ballard
to the Federal Trade Commission.

01:38.715 --> 01:40.282
She's qualified.

01:40.283 --> 01:41.827
So is Jeff Hemmings.

01:41.851 --> 01:43.362
And he has the benefit
of being moderate.

01:43.386 --> 01:45.798
Rachel Ballard is one of
the most respected academics

01:45.822 --> 01:47.133
on the planet.

01:47.157 --> 01:49.869
She wants to regulate
the economy into the ground.

01:49.893 --> 01:52.738
She sees antitrust violations
lurking behind every IPO.

01:52.762 --> 01:55.074
She wants to limit
corporate consolidation.

01:55.098 --> 01:57.109
I mean, come on,
your party is all about

01:57.133 --> 02:00.313
growth and fostering
healthy competition.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.582
Do you think we can get her confirmed?

02:02.606 --> 02:04.408
I think Hemmings is an easier win.

02:04.409 --> 02:06.155
And wins are what we need.

02:06.179 --> 02:08.262
Because the new free trade
agreement with South Korea

02:08.263 --> 02:09.957
doesn't count?

02:09.981 --> 02:11.492
Well, not to diminish
your achievement,

02:11.516 --> 02:13.392
but it's the same deal we had before.

02:13.393 --> 02:15.895
Huge state visit with
the South Korean president.

02:15.896 --> 02:17.906
Live performance at the White House

02:17.907 --> 02:19.919
by his wife, the K-pop star.

02:19.943 --> 02:22.188
But to Russell, just
another deal signing.

02:22.212 --> 02:24.590
I'm sure the state visit
will be very impressive.

02:24.614 --> 02:26.503
And now he's trying to walk it back.

02:26.504 --> 02:28.994
<i>I'm swamped with
asylum applications.</i>

02:29.018 --> 02:31.063
I am really sorry, again,
about tonight.

02:31.087 --> 02:32.998
Will you stop 
apologising? It's fine.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.600
You're saving the world.

02:34.624 --> 02:37.269
I really wanted to try
that new place with you.

02:37.293 --> 02:40.105
Now I am stuck here

02:40.129 --> 02:45.077
with licorice and chips. Mm.

02:45.101 --> 02:46.645
Well, you might want
to hold off on that.

02:46.669 --> 02:48.380
Why?

02:48.404 --> 02:50.850
Turn around.

02:50.874 --> 02:53.919
What?! Oh, my God, that's crazy.

02:53.943 --> 02:56.455
I hope you're cool
with falafel and hummus.

02:56.479 --> 02:58.557
Griffin, oh, my God.
I can't believe you did this.

02:58.581 --> 03:00.793
Oh, please. Liquorice and chips.

03:00.817 --> 03:02.862
That's like dinner
from the gas station.

03:02.886 --> 03:04.930
Yeah, they probably have better
food at the detention centre.

03:04.954 --> 03:06.866
Oh, my God.

03:06.890 --> 03:08.834
No, no, no.

03:08.858 --> 03:10.302
No shame spiral. Look. Here.

03:10.326 --> 03:11.503
Hmm?

03:11.527 --> 03:13.906
Oh, baklava?

03:13.930 --> 03:15.774
Is honey vegan?

03:15.798 --> 03:18.177
- It is today.
- Oh, it is?

03:18.201 --> 03:19.411
Thank you.

03:19.435 --> 03:22.248
Satan worshippers in Washington
want you to think

03:22.272 --> 03:25.584
5G cell service
is all about faster phones

03:25.608 --> 03:26.619
and faster Internet.

03:26.643 --> 03:28.053
But my Shawn-bots out there know

03:28.077 --> 03:32.057
what 5G really is:
government-funded mind control.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.359
It's all part of a secret program

03:33.383 --> 03:34.693
called Project Falanx.

03:34.717 --> 03:35.694
Here's how it works.

03:35.718 --> 03:38.063
Every new 5G cell phone tower

03:38.087 --> 03:40.299
planned to go up across all 50 states

03:40.323 --> 03:41.734
will be digging into the delta waves

03:41.758 --> 03:45.604
emitted by your brain
to increase their frequency.

03:45.628 --> 03:48.974
Once you get up to
13 gigahertz, done.

03:48.998 --> 03:51.543
Under their control.
How do we know this?

03:51.567 --> 03:54.146
South Korea's number one test subject:

03:54.170 --> 03:57.549
White House senior advisor
Mike Barnow.

03:57.573 --> 04:00.185
Barnow exhibits all the classic signs

04:00.209 --> 04:01.587
of 5G brain poisoning.

04:01.611 --> 04:04.356
The bulgy eyes,
the slightly dazed affect.

04:04.380 --> 04:06.992
It's called chronic insomnia,
you numbskull.

04:07.016 --> 04:09.795
How do you protect yourself
and your loved ones from danger?

04:09.819 --> 04:13.472
Simple. The patented Shawn Olson
neutralising wrap.

04:17.192 --> 04:19.404
That's exactly what the maniac
who tased me was trying to use.

04:19.428 --> 04:21.005
Wait.

04:21.029 --> 04:23.208
So he was trying to protect you

04:23.232 --> 04:26.478
from cell phone signals

04:26.502 --> 04:27.613
with a towel?

04:27.637 --> 04:29.915
Mike's assailant was convinced

04:29.939 --> 04:32.918
that he was saving America from
a brainwashed sleeper agent.

04:32.942 --> 04:34.453
A little flattered, actually.

04:34.477 --> 04:35.788
Olson got the idea
of a protective wrap

04:35.812 --> 04:37.289
from a science fiction film.

04:37.313 --> 04:39.224
Total Recall.

04:39.248 --> 04:40.859
Seriously?

04:40.883 --> 04:42.995
Like most conspiracy theories,

04:43.019 --> 04:44.229
Olson starts with something real.

04:44.253 --> 04:45.798
In this case, the new
5G infrastructure

04:45.822 --> 04:47.132
funded by the ESI bill.

04:47.156 --> 04:49.935
Throw in South Korea's
consultation on the new tech

04:49.959 --> 04:52.571
as part of the new
free trade agreement,

04:52.595 --> 04:54.306
jazz it up with some
Schwarzenegger references,

04:54.330 --> 04:56.141
and you get nine million views.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.644
It's the cat video
of conspiracy theories.

04:58.668 --> 05:01.180
Well, this obviously
influenced Mike's assailant,

05:01.204 --> 05:02.948
so we can shut it down, right?

05:02.972 --> 05:06.352
Olson is crafty about
avoiding legal liability.

05:06.376 --> 05:09.154
He never advocates
for specific crimes.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.123
He never publishes his own falsehoods.

05:11.147 --> 05:13.258
He only shares theories
from anonymous users.

05:13.282 --> 05:15.527
- What are our options?
- Monitor his videos closely.

05:15.551 --> 05:18.263
Look out for anything we can
claim is a direct threat.

05:18.287 --> 05:19.698
Other than that,
unfortunately, nothing.

05:19.722 --> 05:21.873
Wow.

05:23.092 --> 05:24.536
Finally got the "all clear"
on your itinerary

05:24.560 --> 05:25.738
with the South Korean first lady.

05:25.762 --> 05:27.539
Well, that came in under the wire.

05:27.563 --> 05:28.574
There was a lot of back and forth.

05:28.598 --> 05:31.810
Ms Kwon's tastes are,
let's say, kitschy.

05:31.834 --> 05:33.846
Breakfast at International
House of Pancakes.

05:33.870 --> 05:34.880
What's wrong with that?

05:34.904 --> 05:37.383
You'll go on a shopping spree
right after.

05:37.407 --> 05:39.451
Country music karaoke.

05:39.475 --> 05:41.520
- Oh, boy.
- Tomorrow she wants to see

05:41.544 --> 05:43.088
an MLB game.

05:43.112 --> 05:45.424
Is President Choi joining us
for any of this?

05:45.448 --> 05:47.726
He has his own itinerary with POTUS.

05:47.750 --> 05:49.395
"An Evening With Rachmaninoff"?

05:49.419 --> 05:52.097
The Baltimore Vocal Arts Society
is doing a performance of

05:52.121 --> 05:54.800
<i>Liturgy of St John Chrysostom</i>
and <i>All-Night Vigil</i>

05:54.824 --> 05:56.201
at the Kennedy Centre.

05:56.225 --> 05:59.071
OK, but it's not
literally all-night

05:59.095 --> 06:01.006
- Well.
- vigil?

06:01.030 --> 06:03.032
I'm kidding. Kidding,
you'll be done by 9:00 p.m.

06:03.056 --> 06:03.978
OK.

06:03.979 --> 06:06.378
The following morning is
the illuminated manuscript

06:06.402 --> 06:07.880
- exhibit at the Freer Gallery.
- Yes. Good.

06:07.904 --> 06:09.114
And then you ha...

06:10.573 --> 06:13.352
You get to eat
pancakes and drive go-karts?

06:13.376 --> 06:15.120
Trust me, I would much rather
be looking at

06:15.144 --> 06:16.555
the illuminated manuscripts.

06:16.579 --> 06:18.490
They have half a dozen
thousand-year-old

06:18.514 --> 06:20.492
Buddhist texts from the Goryeo period.

06:20.516 --> 06:22.694
- It's an incredible acquisition.
- You are my favourite nerd.

06:22.718 --> 06:24.196
Do you know that?

06:24.220 --> 06:27.299
- Mr President, Ms Kwon.
- Hello.

06:27.323 --> 06:29.034
Welcome to the United States.

06:29.058 --> 06:30.969
It's a pleasure to finally
meet you, Madam President.

06:30.993 --> 06:32.371
And you, Mr President.

06:32.395 --> 06:34.635
May I present First Gentleman
Henry McCord.

06:34.636 --> 06:35.941
So nice to meet you.

06:35.965 --> 06:37.376
Hello.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.579
You have quite the fan club.

06:40.603 --> 06:42.147
Those are for my wife.

06:42.171 --> 06:44.049
I'm sure they're here
for Sung-hoon, too.

06:46.442 --> 06:48.921
She likes to pretend
I'm as popular as she is.

06:48.945 --> 06:50.923
I look forward to our visit, Ms Kwon.

06:50.947 --> 06:52.024
Min-hee, please.

06:52.048 --> 06:53.892
Your chief of staff was so helpful.

06:53.916 --> 06:55.527
There's only one thing
he couldn't arrange.

06:55.551 --> 06:57.229
A meeting with Beyoncé.

06:57.253 --> 07:00.432
The power of the presidency
only extends so far.

07:00.456 --> 07:01.900
Shall we?

07:05.528 --> 07:07.239
This is delicious.

07:07.263 --> 07:09.274
Barley tea.

07:09.298 --> 07:11.210
You can find it in any
Korean grocery store.

07:11.234 --> 07:12.744
But it's always been my favourite.

07:12.768 --> 07:14.780
Well, it's good to keep
some of the pleasures of home

07:14.804 --> 07:15.948
once you move into office.

07:15.972 --> 07:18.617
Yeah, we brought
our old popcorn maker.

07:18.641 --> 07:20.185
I love popcorn.

07:20.209 --> 07:22.254
Well, we will definitely
make you some.

07:22.278 --> 07:23.522
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am,

07:23.546 --> 07:26.258
but I'm afraid
there's an urgent matter.

07:26.282 --> 07:28.560
If you'll excuse me for a moment.

07:28.584 --> 07:29.968
He always does that.

07:36.392 --> 07:39.037
Please excuse me.

07:39.061 --> 07:41.240
- What is it?
- Madam President,

07:41.264 --> 07:43.609
Shawn Olson just posted a video
showing a private conversation

07:43.633 --> 07:44.943
between you and Dr  McCord.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.179
- How?
- He claims it came

07:47.203 --> 07:49.047
from a contact in the Secret Service.

07:49.071 --> 07:51.850
Now it's blowing up on
YoureVid and social media.

07:51.874 --> 07:53.952
It's amazing what Choi let us

07:53.976 --> 07:57.289
get away with in the trade talks.

07:57.313 --> 07:59.758
Is he naive or just dumb?

07:59.782 --> 08:02.728
Maybe both. But it's not
like we didn't take a hit.

08:02.752 --> 08:06.565
This deal is going to cost
thousands of American jobs.

08:06.589 --> 08:09.201
Well, hey,
we got to give up something

08:09.225 --> 08:11.336
if we want Korean 5G.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.806
You can't make an omelet
without breaking some eggs.

08:14.830 --> 08:15.941
Oh, my God.

08:15.965 --> 08:18.577
I'll draft an apology
to President Choi,

08:18.601 --> 08:21.079
- but I think if we attack this from...
- Angela.

08:21.103 --> 08:23.148
That video is fake.

08:23.172 --> 08:24.950
Henry and I never said any of that.

08:24.974 --> 08:27.853
It never happened.

08:27.877 --> 08:31.256
With all due respect,
does he know that?

08:33.000 --> 08:39.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:48.337 --> 08:50.031
<i>\The video you
saw, President Choi,</i>

08:50.032 --> 08:51.977
was what we call a "deepfake."

08:51.978 --> 08:54.957
A seemingly real video
created with deep-learning

08:54.958 --> 08:56.102
artificial intelligence.

08:56.126 --> 08:58.050
So the bedroom you see here

08:58.051 --> 09:00.296
isn't any bedroom in the White House.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.466
And if I zoom in, you can clearly see

09:03.490 --> 09:06.169
the digital manipulation
on President McCord's face.

09:06.193 --> 09:08.137
Deepfake technology can
place a real person's face

09:08.161 --> 09:09.973
over any stand-in,

09:09.997 --> 09:13.109
matching lip and facial
movements automatically.

09:13.133 --> 09:15.812
The people you see
in that video are actors.

09:15.836 --> 09:18.420
That's why they distorted
the audio and used subtitles

09:18.444 --> 09:20.288
to mask any vocal discrepancies.

09:20.312 --> 09:22.591
The question, of course, is:
Who would go to the trouble

09:22.615 --> 09:23.825
of making such a video?

09:23.849 --> 09:26.494
Someone wanting to disrupt relations

09:26.518 --> 09:27.762
between our two countries.

09:27.786 --> 09:29.965
Particularly our new trade agreement.

09:29.989 --> 09:31.766
This video was
posted anonymously

09:31.790 --> 09:35.537
to a message board, which was
then picked up by Shawn Olson.

09:35.561 --> 09:39.407
So we may never be able
to trace the source.

09:39.431 --> 09:41.209
Of course, you understand,

09:41.233 --> 09:44.813
Mr President, Henry and I
would never speak about you

09:44.837 --> 09:47.282
or your country with such disrespect.

09:47.306 --> 09:50.151
Yet three million viewers on
YoureVid believe you would.

09:50.175 --> 09:51.786
We've already
put out a statement

09:51.810 --> 09:53.288
debunking the video.

09:53.312 --> 09:55.490
Every legitimate news outlet
in the world has taken it down.

09:55.514 --> 09:57.258
But as we all know,
illegitimate outlets

09:57.282 --> 09:59.260
can still shape public opinion.

09:59.284 --> 10:02.697
This video has already created
a great deal of animosity

10:02.721 --> 10:05.333
in my country toward
the United States.

10:05.357 --> 10:08.303
My advisors feel it's
best we take some time

10:08.327 --> 10:10.411
before moving forward
with the trade agreement.

10:12.264 --> 10:15.844
Mr President, I think that if
you and I responded together,

10:15.868 --> 10:18.079
we could show your people

10:18.103 --> 10:21.182
that our long and historic partnership

10:21.206 --> 10:24.786
can't be disrupted
by one crude attack.

10:24.810 --> 10:26.488
It would be a great way to undercut

10:26.512 --> 10:28.523
- whatever power these things have.
- Yes.

10:28.547 --> 10:30.615
We'll remain for the state dinner,

10:30.616 --> 10:31.905
but I'm afraid we must postpone

10:31.906 --> 10:34.618
any further talks of
the trade agreement.

10:34.642 --> 10:37.721
Madam President, I hope to see
those illuminated manuscripts

10:37.745 --> 10:39.156
with you another time.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.131
Of course.

10:42.450 --> 10:44.762
<i>The entire infrastructure bill</i>

10:44.786 --> 10:48.732
was sold with South Korea's
cooperation on 5G.

10:48.756 --> 10:50.634
If we don't get
that deal back in place,

10:50.658 --> 10:51.769
the whole upgrade falls apart.

10:51.793 --> 10:53.003
Let's not go full Eeyore.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.872
South Korea's not the
only tech game in town.

10:54.896 --> 10:56.340
Yeah, well, only the best.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.243
So, how can one fake video take
down the entire trade deal?

10:59.267 --> 11:01.178
Well, it doesn't help
that the damn thing

11:01.202 --> 11:03.180
is still pinging around social media.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.784
OK, look, let's release
a shorter version

11:06.808 --> 11:09.219
of the presentation
we just showed President Choi.

11:09.243 --> 11:11.422
We'll turn this into
a teachable moment

11:11.446 --> 11:13.690
so people can learn
to recognise these fakes.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.691
And why?

11:14.715 --> 11:16.427
I mean, for God's sakes,

11:16.451 --> 11:18.328
can we get the video off of YoureVid?

11:18.352 --> 11:20.063
Look, we tried. 
They said deepfakes

11:20.087 --> 11:21.632
do not violate 
their terms of service.

11:21.656 --> 11:24.134
Oh. Call Chelsea Weldon.

11:24.158 --> 11:27.304
I had a long talk with her
and some of the tech CEOs

11:27.328 --> 11:29.973
on the campaign trail
about misinformation.

11:29.997 --> 11:32.075
She said she wanted to take action.

11:32.099 --> 11:33.076
Now's her chance.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.077
Dr  McCord.

11:34.101 --> 11:35.145
Oh, hey, Evan.

11:35.169 --> 11:36.914
I know, karaoke's canceled.

11:36.938 --> 11:38.849
Actually, the car
will be here in ten.

11:38.873 --> 11:41.118
And it's IHOP, shopping,
and then karaoke.

11:41.142 --> 11:42.619
Ms Kwon is not one to miss a party.

11:42.643 --> 11:45.222
Apparently, I'm off to eat pancakes.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.490
Bye.

11:46.514 --> 11:48.298
Hang in there.

11:51.819 --> 11:52.963
Hello?

11:52.987 --> 11:54.131
Stevie.

11:54.155 --> 11:55.999
- It's Dmitri. Petrov.
- Oh.

11:56.023 --> 11:59.169
Hi. I couldn't tell
who was calling.

11:59.193 --> 12:01.138
I know. I'm still
using encryption.

12:01.162 --> 12:02.673
It's an old habit.

12:02.697 --> 12:04.508
- How are you?
- Good.

12:04.532 --> 12:06.210
Swamped at the moment.

12:06.234 --> 12:08.212
Oh. Sorry to bother you.

12:08.236 --> 12:09.680
I would have sent an email, but

12:09.704 --> 12:10.981
Talia made me promise to call you

12:11.005 --> 12:12.716
with my human voice.

12:12.740 --> 12:15.085
Well, at least she's working
directly through you this time.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.253
Yes. Anyway,

12:16.277 --> 12:18.589
I'm meeting a few 
people at this bar

12:18.613 --> 12:21.525
near Union Station tonight
to say goodbye to DC.

12:21.549 --> 12:24.328
- Wait. You're leaving?
- Yes.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.502
For Guyana.

12:26.387 --> 12:27.431
Anyway,

12:27.455 --> 12:29.266
we're meeting around 9:00,

12:29.290 --> 12:31.034
and I thought,
if you wanted to stop by...

12:31.058 --> 12:33.003
You're welcome to bring someone.

12:33.027 --> 12:35.772
That's so nice of you.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.876
Yeah, I've kind of been pulling

12:38.900 --> 12:41.178
these crazy late nights
at work recently, so.

12:41.202 --> 12:42.946
But, yeah,
if I can get away,

12:42.970 --> 12:44.982
I definitely...

12:45.006 --> 12:46.884
I will. I will come raise a glass.

12:46.908 --> 12:48.385
OK.

12:48.409 --> 12:49.786
I'll text you the name.

12:49.810 --> 12:50.888
Great.

12:50.912 --> 12:53.257
Please thank Talia 
for the phone call.

12:53.281 --> 12:55.559
It is nice to hear
your human voice.

12:55.583 --> 12:56.560
You, too.

12:56.584 --> 12:57.761
Maybe see you later.

12:57.785 --> 13:00.330
That's the plan, sort of. Bye.

13:02.857 --> 13:04.535
My daughter is working

13:04.559 --> 13:05.869
in a fashion house in Milan.

13:05.893 --> 13:08.372
She's usually the shopper
in the family.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.274
I was developing a clothing
and wellness brand

13:10.298 --> 13:11.775
for the digital space.

13:11.799 --> 13:13.443
But then I got married.

13:13.467 --> 13:15.646
Was there a conflict of interest?

13:15.670 --> 13:18.115
Korean anti-corruption
practices are very strict.

13:18.139 --> 13:19.950
I had to sell everything.

13:19.974 --> 13:21.752
The things we do for love.

13:21.776 --> 13:23.420
Policy is so much more interesting

13:23.444 --> 13:24.755
than fashion anyway.

13:24.779 --> 13:27.591
I'm not sure my daughter
would agree with you on that.

13:27.615 --> 13:30.193
But they're so intertwined.

13:30.217 --> 13:31.762
Take cosmetics.

13:31.786 --> 13:33.096
In our previous trade agreement,

13:33.120 --> 13:34.565
the U.S. and South Korea

13:34.589 --> 13:37.701
placed a mutual tariff
of 7.9% on skin care.

13:37.725 --> 13:40.237
Then K-Beauty exploded overseas,

13:40.261 --> 13:41.905
but the tariffs were holding us back

13:41.929 --> 13:44.207
in the U.S. market, so
now the new agreement

13:44.231 --> 13:46.143
includes a provision
for both our nations to reduce

13:46.167 --> 13:47.611
all cosmetics duties

13:47.635 --> 13:48.979
by two percentage points annually.

13:49.003 --> 13:51.348
It's just numbers on a page,

13:51.372 --> 13:55.218
but it's how powerful men
decide what those girls

13:55.242 --> 13:56.720
get to wear.

13:56.744 --> 13:58.855
Sounds like you had
a hand in that, too.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.593
My husband appreciates my perspective.

14:02.617 --> 14:05.362
It's a shame that the trade
agreement has to be put on hold.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.030
On this matter, I have

14:07.054 --> 14:08.832
no influence.

14:08.856 --> 14:11.902
Like you with Beyoncé.

14:14.562 --> 14:18.709
YoureVid shares the president's
concerns about fake news.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.844
It was a top item
at our retreat this year.

14:20.868 --> 14:23.480
Well, here's an idea:
take down some fake news.

14:23.504 --> 14:25.716
It's more complicated than that.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.384
Is it? You guys tear

14:27.408 --> 14:29.286
into licensed content
like dogs on a ham hock.

14:29.310 --> 14:32.521
We have guidance from the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act

14:32.522 --> 14:34.500
to enforce copyright issues.

14:34.524 --> 14:36.936
We have no such 
guidance on deepfakes.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.537
Sure, you do. From me.

14:38.561 --> 14:40.239
Take down the video.

14:40.263 --> 14:41.874
I appreciate your sense of urgency,

14:41.898 --> 14:45.311
but you have to understand
I am the steward

14:45.335 --> 14:47.847
of a massive system of representation

14:47.871 --> 14:50.950
where every decision holds
ramifications for the future

14:50.974 --> 14:53.485
of all expression online.

14:53.509 --> 14:56.488
Some deepfakes are social
commentary, others satire.

14:56.512 --> 14:58.724
We can't make blanket policy here.

14:58.748 --> 15:00.492
Yet somehow you manage to monitor

15:00.516 --> 15:01.827
pornography and explicit violence.

15:01.851 --> 15:03.863
Through user reporting
and retro review.

15:03.887 --> 15:05.865
Well, why can't you do the same here?

15:05.889 --> 15:09.068
Because we are a platform,
not a publisher.

15:09.092 --> 15:13.372
300 hours of video is uploaded
to our site every minute.

15:13.396 --> 15:16.575
Hiring human moderators to ascertain

15:16.599 --> 15:19.078
whether videos are real or fake
isn't scalable.

15:19.102 --> 15:22.781
Ms Weldon, deepfakes like the one

15:22.805 --> 15:26.585
millions of people
are watching right now

15:26.609 --> 15:31.156
threaten to undermine our whole
concept of objective reality.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.160
Do you understand what that's
going to do to our democracy?

15:35.184 --> 15:36.619
I don't know if you heard,

15:36.620 --> 15:38.799
but a fan of Shawn Olson's
broke into my house

15:38.823 --> 15:41.201
and shot 50,000 volts
of electricity into me.

15:41.225 --> 15:44.171
That wouldn't have happened
without your platform.

15:44.195 --> 15:47.174
And that is horrible,

15:47.198 --> 15:51.712
but it's the risk we've always
taken with free speech.

15:51.736 --> 15:55.148
It's why our policy is the same
as our Founding Fathers':

15:55.172 --> 15:57.484
let the people think for themselves

15:57.508 --> 16:00.454
and trust that good speech
will fight bad speech.

16:00.478 --> 16:02.622
Our Founding Fathers had no idea

16:02.646 --> 16:04.797
there'd be so many idiots.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.898
- Hey. You made it.
- Hi. Yeah.

16:11.922 --> 16:14.311
I was able to get away.

16:14.312 --> 16:15.489
- No security?
- No.

16:15.513 --> 16:16.724
I asked them to wait outside.

16:16.748 --> 16:17.792
Hey, Talia.

16:17.816 --> 16:19.266
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

16:21.820 --> 16:22.997
I think you know my friends

16:23.021 --> 16:24.031
from the Agency, Molly and Dylan.

16:24.055 --> 16:25.533
Oh. What? Hi.

16:25.557 --> 16:27.535
Yes. You worked with my father. Wow.

16:27.559 --> 16:28.669
How's he liking the big house?

16:28.693 --> 16:30.304
You can be honest.

16:30.328 --> 16:32.073
He misses us, right?

16:32.097 --> 16:34.709
His new job is definitely
different from intelligence.

16:34.733 --> 16:36.644
For example, today his duties

16:36.668 --> 16:40.047
included shopping with a K-pop star.

16:40.071 --> 16:42.349
What is K-pop?

16:42.373 --> 16:44.552
It's this whole genre of
pop music from South Korea.

16:44.576 --> 16:46.420
What?

16:46.444 --> 16:47.755
I contain multitudes.

16:47.779 --> 16:49.924
Actually, you know, you really need

16:49.948 --> 16:52.660
to see the first lady of
South Korea. She's, like,

16:52.684 --> 16:54.395
- I mean, she's this huge star.
- Amazing.

16:54.419 --> 16:56.263
Do you mind if I...? 
Oh. No, no, no.

16:56.287 --> 16:57.732
I want to see.

16:57.756 --> 17:00.434
Play: ♪ Bye-bye, boy... ♪

17:00.458 --> 17:01.435
Excellent choice.

17:01.459 --> 17:02.436
That's the one.

17:03.762 --> 17:05.873
Yeah. OK.

17:07.699 --> 17:09.743
Oh.

17:15.807 --> 17:17.952
Guyana, huh?

17:17.976 --> 17:20.921
Yeah.  I thought
I'd celebrate my new citizenship

17:20.944 --> 17:22.256
by leaving the country.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.259
So, what are you 
going to do there?

17:25.282 --> 17:27.795
Help build houses
for an organisation.

17:27.819 --> 17:28.963
Wow.

17:28.987 --> 17:32.633
Are you, like, 
addicted to hardship?

17:32.657 --> 17:34.101
- You think I have a problem?
- I think you should definitely

17:34.125 --> 17:35.436
- get it checked out.
- Yeah.

17:35.460 --> 17:37.738
I thought so. Well,
I'm glad you were able to,

17:37.762 --> 17:42.309
you know, to get away from
the refugees to have a drink.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.612
Yep. Touché.

17:44.636 --> 17:46.480
You enjoying your new job?

17:46.504 --> 17:49.984
Yeah, I'm not really sure
"enjoying" is the right word,

17:50.008 --> 17:52.859
but it's very fulfilling.

17:54.746 --> 17:57.564
Then you know why 
I'm going to Guyana.

18:01.519 --> 18:05.533
So, there I am
in this clothing store,

18:05.557 --> 18:09.036
oh, by the way,
big sale on sports bras,

18:09.060 --> 18:11.372
- Thanks.
- when Min-hee starts to quote

18:11.396 --> 18:14.041
specific numbers from the trade deal.

18:14.065 --> 18:18.045
Turns out that she collaborated
with President Choi

18:18.069 --> 18:20.247
on certain passages.

18:20.271 --> 18:24.418
So I think that we have
a legitimate back channel

18:24.442 --> 18:26.754
to getting the deal signed
before they leave.

18:26.778 --> 18:27.922
I could try, anyway.

18:27.946 --> 18:29.557
Yeah. I mean, absolutely.

18:29.581 --> 18:33.460
Anything that you can do,
that would be... Thank you.

18:33.484 --> 18:36.063
What's going on? Hmm?

18:36.087 --> 18:37.531
- Oh.
- There another video?

18:37.555 --> 18:39.600
No.

18:39.624 --> 18:42.503
But once I searched
for it on YoureVid,

18:42.527 --> 18:44.672
the algorithm started autoplaying

18:44.696 --> 18:48.148
all of these other paranoid videos.

18:49.033 --> 18:50.945
Yeah. Illuminati, flat-earthers.

18:50.969 --> 18:52.613
All the classics.

18:52.637 --> 18:57.952
Well, it starts with
the crazy Project Falanx stuff,

18:57.976 --> 19:00.054
which brings in the people

19:00.078 --> 19:03.791
who are already suspicious
of big institutions, and then

19:03.815 --> 19:08.024
it starts validating
all of their views,

19:08.025 --> 19:12.472
playing one video after another.

19:12.496 --> 19:15.642
And somehow, it all leads
to white nationalism.

19:15.666 --> 19:18.645
The pot of gold at the end
of the extremist rainbow.

19:18.669 --> 19:21.181
Yeah.

19:21.205 --> 19:23.483
You know, Chelsea Weldon
says that YoureVid

19:23.507 --> 19:25.418
is a neutral platform,

19:25.442 --> 19:28.421
but the way it's set up,
it just keeps feeding you

19:28.445 --> 19:31.491
more and more poison,
you never see anything

19:31.515 --> 19:34.694
that offers another point of view.

19:34.718 --> 19:37.030
- It doesn't want you to.
- How do they justify it?

19:37.054 --> 19:38.698
What is the rationale?

19:38.722 --> 19:40.433
Russell says that their philosophy

19:40.457 --> 19:43.203
is "fight bad speech
with good speech."

19:43.227 --> 19:47.007
But how, if the algorithm
only lets you hear

19:47.031 --> 19:48.341
one kind of speech?

19:48.365 --> 19:49.876
Well, it's not a happy comparison,

19:49.900 --> 19:51.578
but it makes me think
of pharmaceutical companies

19:51.602 --> 19:52.846
- that push opiates.
- Yes.

19:52.870 --> 19:54.281
That is exactly what I was thinking.

19:54.305 --> 19:56.783
It's an addiction model.

19:56.807 --> 20:01.555
Anger and fear, you know,
produce an endorphin rush.

20:01.579 --> 20:05.525
So you have to keep watching
rage-inducing videos

20:05.549 --> 20:07.527
to get your fix.

20:07.551 --> 20:10.263
YoureVid doesn't want
to self-regulate,

20:10.287 --> 20:14.334
because they need their users
to be addicted to their product.

20:14.358 --> 20:17.871
That's what's driving
their bottom line.

20:17.895 --> 20:20.207
And they have free speech
to back it up.

20:20.231 --> 20:24.611
I mean, the game is fixed, and

20:24.635 --> 20:27.053
bad speech is winning.

20:28.834 --> 20:31.970
We couldn't get YoureVid
to take down one video.

20:31.971 --> 20:34.509
We're kidding ourselves
if we think we're going to regulate

20:34.510 --> 20:36.955
the biggest streaming
platform on the planet.

20:36.979 --> 20:38.557
Every other medium is regulated.

20:38.581 --> 20:41.126
Print news has libel laws.

20:41.150 --> 20:42.461
Radio and television,

20:42.485 --> 20:44.129
the FCC.

20:44.153 --> 20:47.533
Why are we making an exception
for digital platforms?

20:47.557 --> 20:49.001
Because they're popular.

20:49.025 --> 20:51.370
And cracking down on them when
they say bad things about you

20:51.394 --> 20:52.838
- makes you look like a
tin-pot dictator.  - Oh.

20:52.862 --> 20:56.241
Oh, look, I couldn't regulate
YoureVid unilaterally

20:56.265 --> 20:57.743
even if I wanted to,

20:57.767 --> 21:01.413
because that would be a job for
the Federal Trade Commission.

21:01.437 --> 21:04.183
So we're back to Rachel Ballard.

21:04.207 --> 21:05.918
I know she's aggressive.

21:05.942 --> 21:07.953
But that's why we need her.
She can make the argument

21:07.977 --> 21:09.855
to the Senate, we can
take it to the public.

21:09.879 --> 21:12.124
Look, this is so much bigger

21:12.148 --> 21:15.928
than one bad video about me.

21:15.952 --> 21:17.996
It's an assault on truth

21:18.020 --> 21:20.766
and objective reality.

21:20.790 --> 21:22.968
I'll take the Senate majority
leader's temperature

21:22.992 --> 21:26.772
on Ballard, but I'm pretty sure
I know what he's going to say.

21:26.796 --> 21:28.407
Well, then make a better
argument, Russell.

21:28.431 --> 21:29.445
- OK?
- In the meantime,

21:29.446 --> 21:31.944
we have a trade agreement with
South Korea to try to save.

21:31.968 --> 21:33.478
Henry's on that.

21:33.502 --> 21:36.821
Sorry, really? How, exactly?

21:38.541 --> 21:41.286
I hope this isn't too fast for you.

21:41.310 --> 21:43.889
I was a fighter pilot.
I'm good with speed.

21:43.913 --> 21:46.792
I couldn't be in the military.
Too much obedience.

21:46.816 --> 21:48.032
Ha.

21:49.719 --> 21:51.263
Sorry.

21:51.287 --> 21:53.515
But your husband was an
officer in the army, right?

21:53.539 --> 21:54.409
Yes.

21:54.410 --> 21:56.935
Before he was expelled
for criticising the government.

21:56.959 --> 21:59.696
Clearly you've opened his
thinking in many ways.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.940
He was a bold thinker
long before we met.

22:01.964 --> 22:03.709
It's why I love him.

22:03.733 --> 22:05.377
I was very impressed
with your contribution

22:05.401 --> 22:06.478
to the trade agreement.

22:06.502 --> 22:07.980
I was wondering if you had

22:08.004 --> 22:10.249
any other ideas about things
that came up during negotiation.

22:12.341 --> 22:15.721
I know you want my husband
to sign the trade deal.

22:15.745 --> 22:17.256
I'm not suggesting...

22:17.280 --> 22:18.257
I want him to sign, too,

22:18.281 --> 22:19.725
but you have to understand.

22:19.749 --> 22:22.227
He won the presidency
by a slim margin.

22:22.251 --> 22:23.629
He's concerned about 
his public image.

22:23.653 --> 22:25.998
That's why,
if there's something he wants,

22:26.022 --> 22:28.567
if there's something
to help repair the damage...

22:28.591 --> 22:30.335
If you could drop
the barriers of entry

22:30.359 --> 22:32.437
for South Korean software,

22:32.461 --> 22:34.273
that might be persuasive.

22:34.297 --> 22:36.842
I wasn't aware that
software restrictions

22:36.866 --> 22:38.877
- were part of the deal.
- Because they've always been there.

22:38.901 --> 22:41.413
Based on some old idea
that South Korean software

22:41.437 --> 22:43.348
could expose Americans
to foreign hacking.

22:43.372 --> 22:45.517
But you already use our hardware.

22:45.541 --> 22:48.620
If we wanted to hack you,
we would've done it by now.

22:48.644 --> 22:51.490
Oh! Would you take a video of me

22:51.514 --> 22:52.791
while I drive?

22:52.815 --> 22:56.428
- Sure.
- Vertical, please.

22:56.452 --> 22:58.203
Better for Insta stories.

22:59.855 --> 23:02.801
I love America!

23:07.296 --> 23:08.940
- Hi.
- He's not here.

23:08.964 --> 23:10.409
No, can I talk to you, please?

23:10.433 --> 23:12.602
Yeah, I've got four minutes.
Three minutes. What's up?

23:12.626 --> 23:14.846
OK, Griffin is
probably the nicest guy

23:14.870 --> 23:15.947
that I have ever dated.

23:15.971 --> 23:19.618
- Bastard.
- He's funny, he's smart, he's

23:19.642 --> 23:22.921
thoughtful without being,
like, "milady" about it.

23:22.945 --> 23:23.791
Eh?

23:23.792 --> 23:26.182
You know, like, "Would milady
like another Chardonnay?"

23:26.882 --> 23:28.727
Those guys that are super pleased

23:28.751 --> 23:30.796
with how attentive they are,
and it's, like,

23:30.820 --> 23:32.397
kind of weird and off-putting.

23:32.421 --> 23:33.665
I'm so glad I'm not dating anymore.

23:33.689 --> 23:35.400
What's the problem?

23:35.424 --> 23:36.802
There's this other guy.

23:36.826 --> 23:38.370
- Ruh-roh.
- Yeah.

23:38.394 --> 23:41.039
- We dated for a while,
- Mm-hmm.

23:41.063 --> 23:43.942
and it was very passionate
and kind of secretive,

23:43.966 --> 23:45.510
and then he was gone for three years,

23:45.534 --> 23:48.629
and it took me most of
that time to get over him.

23:49.430 --> 23:50.916
He's back. In two
days he's leaving for Guyana.

23:50.940 --> 23:51.863
Is he joining a cult?

23:51.887 --> 23:54.453
No. He's going there to build
houses, because, you know,

23:54.477 --> 23:56.755
on top of being a fantastic kisser,

23:56.779 --> 23:58.757
he's also very into service.

23:58.781 --> 24:01.059
Well, then it's a good
thing he's going to Guyana.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.761
- Really?
- Yes, if it didn't work out before.

24:02.785 --> 24:04.062
It was never going to.

24:04.086 --> 24:05.697
You're all caught up in everything

24:05.721 --> 24:07.499
you've been fantasising about
for the last three years.

24:07.523 --> 24:09.534
I mean, what happens when
it's no longer a hot secret,

24:09.558 --> 24:11.703
and you find out he's into bad music

24:11.727 --> 24:13.839
and chews with his mouth open?

24:13.863 --> 24:16.174
Well, what if he's the one,
and I'm, like, letting him

24:16.198 --> 24:17.509
drift out of my life forever?

24:17.533 --> 24:18.944
Here's what Jane Austen
doesn't tell you:

24:18.968 --> 24:20.512
there is no "the one",

24:20.536 --> 24:21.813
there's only "the handful."

24:21.837 --> 24:24.282
Griffin adores you and
he lives in the same city.

24:24.306 --> 24:26.451
If it works, stick to it. Sorry,

24:26.475 --> 24:28.186
I got to run.

24:28.210 --> 24:30.088
Senator Breckinridge.

24:30.112 --> 24:32.758
Russell. What brings you
to the roller rink?

24:32.782 --> 24:35.427
The president is looking
to nominate Rachel Ballard

24:35.451 --> 24:38.463
for Federal Trade commissioner.
We need to get her confirmed.

24:38.487 --> 24:42.300
Now, before you tell me
why we can't get a majority,

24:42.324 --> 24:45.337
you should know that
the fake video YoureVid

24:45.361 --> 24:47.038
still won't take down has made this

24:47.062 --> 24:50.242
a top priority. I'll also
remind you how effective

24:50.266 --> 24:53.345
this president has been at
building bipartisan coalitions.

24:53.369 --> 24:55.881
You undermine her at your peril.

24:55.905 --> 24:58.984
I was going to ask how
Carol's doing, but OK.

24:59.008 --> 25:02.120
I think Ballard's a great pick.

25:02.144 --> 25:04.389
Good.

25:04.413 --> 25:05.757
So who's her opposition?

25:05.781 --> 25:07.292
You should be good
with the centre right,

25:07.316 --> 25:08.960
they love putting
the squeeze on Big Tech.

25:08.984 --> 25:12.130
Since when are Republicans in
favour of industry regulation?

25:12.154 --> 25:14.766
Tech firms are the future
of American media,

25:14.790 --> 25:17.669
which means they're the
future of American politics,

25:17.693 --> 25:20.272
and they're all owned by a
bunch of California Democrats.

25:20.296 --> 25:22.073
Cynical. But I'll take it.

25:22.097 --> 25:25.343
So, you think we have
the votes to confirm.

25:25.367 --> 25:27.312
I wouldn't say that.

25:27.336 --> 25:29.548
With the principled libertarians
and the pro-growth Dems,

25:29.572 --> 25:30.615
it is not a guarantee.

25:30.639 --> 25:33.084
Unless...

25:33.108 --> 25:34.586
What?

25:34.610 --> 25:36.254
You get Hanson.

25:36.278 --> 25:39.090
I know he's causing
the president some trouble.

25:39.114 --> 25:40.158
Wh...

25:40.182 --> 25:42.694
He's investigating her for treason.

25:42.718 --> 25:44.362
He forced one of her
closest colleagues

25:44.386 --> 25:46.865
to resign last week.

25:46.889 --> 25:48.300
He's with you on Big Tech,

25:48.324 --> 25:51.002
and he's got three
junior senators in his pocket.

25:51.026 --> 25:52.337
That'll get you past 50.

25:52.361 --> 25:55.246
It's either that or roll the dice.

25:59.502 --> 26:01.613
<i>So the only way to regulate</i>

26:01.637 --> 26:04.316
these false attacks against me

26:04.340 --> 26:07.152
is to appeal to the guy
leading the attacks.

26:07.176 --> 26:09.454
Wow. You got to love
the irony in that.

26:09.478 --> 26:10.589
Oh, I don't.

26:10.613 --> 26:13.124
But Breckinridge thinks Hanson's

26:13.148 --> 26:14.693
the path to confirmation.

26:14.717 --> 26:16.127
Well, you're not sending me in.

26:16.151 --> 26:19.931
I already had to let Miller
take credit for the ESI bill.

26:19.955 --> 26:22.400
That's as far as I'm going
with selling my soul

26:22.424 --> 26:24.135
for political expediency.

26:24.159 --> 26:26.738
Well, then, we go to the bullpen.

26:26.762 --> 26:28.306
Make the call.

26:28.330 --> 26:30.375
Mark. It's been too long.

26:30.399 --> 26:32.283
That is has, Mr Vice President.

26:33.469 --> 26:34.980
How are Vicki and the kids?

26:35.004 --> 26:37.215
Doing good.

26:37.239 --> 26:39.584
Lucas is about to graduate,
if you can believe it.

26:39.608 --> 26:40.852
Wow, that's terrific.

26:40.876 --> 26:43.889
We'll have to have you over
next time they're in DC.

26:43.913 --> 26:47.259
Could we start with some calamari?

26:47.283 --> 26:49.828
Mmm. Sounds good.

26:49.852 --> 26:51.530
Do you mind one piece of business?

26:51.554 --> 26:54.099
And here I thought you
just wanted to catch up.

26:54.123 --> 26:55.967
I want to take your
temperature on Rachel Ballard

26:55.991 --> 26:57.869
for Federal Trade commissioner.

26:57.893 --> 26:58.937
The liberal economist?

26:58.961 --> 27:01.239
That's... Hmm.

27:01.263 --> 27:03.041
- That's a tough confirmation.
- Yeah.

27:03.065 --> 27:05.076
Breckinridge wants to give her
a hearing, and he thought

27:05.100 --> 27:06.378
you might be able to help.

27:06.402 --> 27:07.679
Did he?

27:07.703 --> 27:09.781
Yeah. We have a rare opportunity here.

27:09.805 --> 27:12.751
Digital media is a
dangerously unregulated force

27:12.775 --> 27:15.053
for disruption. And right now,

27:15.077 --> 27:17.088
California Democrats
are calling the shots.

27:17.112 --> 27:19.558
With regulation, we can ensure

27:19.582 --> 27:22.093
that <i>real</i> conservative principles,

27:22.117 --> 27:24.629
not just the alt-right

27:24.653 --> 27:26.765
- get a full hearing online.
- And what does that look like,

27:26.789 --> 27:29.134
an equal time law for online videos?

27:29.158 --> 27:32.604
Open up the algorithms
that drive the big platforms.

27:32.628 --> 27:35.747
Ensure there's no bias
against any party or ideology.

27:36.832 --> 27:38.877
Sorry. No.

27:38.901 --> 27:40.145
No.

27:40.169 --> 27:41.479
That's it?

27:41.503 --> 27:43.715
I'd love to see Big Tech
come to heel, but not

27:43.739 --> 27:46.251
if it's another socialist win
for this administration.

27:46.275 --> 27:47.652
This isn't cable news.

27:47.676 --> 27:49.955
ESI was a massive government handout.

27:49.979 --> 27:51.623
She yanked the political
centre of gravity

27:51.647 --> 27:54.426
way to the left, and betrayed
everything she ran on.

27:54.450 --> 27:57.128
I'm sorry, what do you mean?
She ran on ESI.

27:57.152 --> 28:00.298
No, she ran on the legacy
of Conrad Dalton.

28:00.322 --> 28:03.401
Moderation. Practicality. Unity.

28:03.425 --> 28:06.404
The way she got that bill funded
was none of those things.

28:06.428 --> 28:08.073
OK.

28:08.097 --> 28:10.842
So that's it, no compromise?

28:10.866 --> 28:14.512
I have enjoyed working with you,
Carlos, but is this

28:14.536 --> 28:17.048
what you imagined for yourself?

28:17.072 --> 28:18.216
Sitting on your hands

28:18.240 --> 28:20.185
while the president
bloats the federal government

28:20.209 --> 28:22.187
beyond FDR's wildest dreams?

28:22.211 --> 28:24.656
Believe it or not,

28:24.680 --> 28:27.659
she meant what she said
on the campaign trail.

28:27.683 --> 28:30.528
She wants to work with all sides.

28:30.552 --> 28:31.596
I'm more interested in seeing

28:31.620 --> 28:33.665
what <i>you</i> can do for this country.

28:33.689 --> 28:36.167
That moment can be here

28:36.191 --> 28:39.076
sooner than you realise.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.085
Impeachment? He actually said that?

28:44.109 --> 28:47.497
Forget Rachel Ballard and the FTC.

28:47.498 --> 28:50.544
Forget regulating YoureVid
or banning deepfakes.

28:50.568 --> 28:53.313
Hanson wants to take you down.

28:53.337 --> 28:56.483
What an excellent sign
for a constitutional democracy.

28:56.507 --> 28:58.652
What exactly makes me such a threat?

28:58.676 --> 29:01.488
- Did he say?
- He either sincerely believes

29:01.512 --> 29:03.623
that you are
a crypto-socialist autocrat

29:03.647 --> 29:05.559
or he's making a power grab.

29:05.583 --> 29:06.860
It's a tough call.

29:06.884 --> 29:08.261
I don't buy it.

29:08.285 --> 29:10.096
The Iran scandal's nearly dead.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.965
Hanson knows he's out of moves.

29:11.989 --> 29:13.099
This is his death spiral.

29:13.123 --> 29:14.568
I'm not so sure.

29:14.592 --> 29:16.636
It looks like he's still
recruiting candidates

29:16.660 --> 29:18.038
to get dirt on the president.

29:18.062 --> 29:20.340
- Like who?
- Like me.

29:20.364 --> 29:22.075
He all but offered
to make me president.

29:22.099 --> 29:24.110
Wow.

29:24.134 --> 29:26.446
And what did you say?

29:26.470 --> 29:28.048
I didn't dignify 
it with a response.

29:28.072 --> 29:29.849
OK, fine. If
Hanson was our last shot

29:29.873 --> 29:31.117
at getting a 
couple of Republicans

29:31.141 --> 29:33.420
to stand up for
truth in digital media,

29:33.444 --> 29:34.921
let's head to the other
side of the aisle.

29:34.945 --> 29:37.090
Centrist Democrats looking
a little vulnerable

29:37.114 --> 29:38.158
in midterms for 500?

29:39.416 --> 29:42.095
Senator Stulbarg of Minnesota.

29:42.119 --> 29:44.480
Senator Furey of Pennsylvania.

29:44.504 --> 29:46.199
I'm sure they'd love the help
of the White House to shore up

29:46.223 --> 29:47.534
their constituencies.

29:47.558 --> 29:49.970
- Get into it, Mike.
- I'm on it.

29:49.994 --> 29:52.105
Digital media needs regulating,
to be sure.

29:52.129 --> 29:54.708
I just don't know if Rachel Ballard

29:54.732 --> 29:55.742
is the one to do it.

29:55.766 --> 29:57.611
She's hostile and divisive.

29:57.635 --> 29:59.446
Isn't a tough negotiator
exactly who you want

29:59.470 --> 30:01.922
trying to reign in one of the
biggest industries in the world?

30:01.946 --> 30:03.717
I think we can protect
the general public

30:03.741 --> 30:05.986
without impeding
innovation and growth.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.387
I get it.

30:07.411 --> 30:09.289
Tech companies have been
great supporters of Democrats

30:09.313 --> 30:10.957
like you, but ask yourselves,

30:10.981 --> 30:13.260
do you have to choose
between the health

30:13.284 --> 30:15.061
of our democracy
and a couple of million dollars

30:15.085 --> 30:16.429
in campaign contributions?

30:16.453 --> 30:18.298
I'm sorry,

30:18.322 --> 30:20.567
but it's a little rich taking lessons

30:20.591 --> 30:23.036
from you on money and politics, Mike.

30:23.060 --> 30:25.505
You ladies know me
as a pragmatist and a survivor.

30:25.529 --> 30:27.307
I'm not asking you to do anything

30:27.331 --> 30:29.342
that would threaten
either of your futures.

30:29.366 --> 30:30.910
I'm offering you a way to win.

30:30.934 --> 30:32.345
How is that?

30:32.369 --> 30:34.247
The White House
is currently renegotiating

30:34.271 --> 30:36.483
our free trade agreement
with South Korea.

30:36.507 --> 30:40.151
We can all but guarantee
South Korean companies

30:40.152 --> 30:42.864
will build manufacturing plants
in your states.

30:42.888 --> 30:45.967
Thousands of well-paying
blue collar union jobs

30:45.991 --> 30:49.170
delivered to the good people
of Minnesota and Pennsylvania,

30:49.194 --> 30:50.338
weeks before the election.

30:50.362 --> 30:53.608
That's a tricky phrase,
"all but guarantee"?

30:53.632 --> 30:56.111
Mm. In politics,
it means you've got nothing.

30:56.135 --> 30:57.879
Let's just say I can

30:57.903 --> 31:01.783
guarantee that we almost
certainly have a guarantee.

31:01.807 --> 31:03.852
When you have something real,

31:03.876 --> 31:05.720
- get back to us.
- And how about

31:05.744 --> 31:08.189
next time,
<i>you</i> cross Pennsylvania Avenue?

31:08.213 --> 31:09.991
Or you know what? Bagels and coffee.

31:10.015 --> 31:11.726
If you're going to make us
come here for nothing.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.891
I hear the aerospace
caucus got souvenir pens.

31:13.892 --> 31:15.397
Nobody ever gave me a pen.

31:15.421 --> 31:18.066
<i>Did you know that the U.S.</i>

31:18.090 --> 31:20.494
has these old,
out-of-date restrictions

31:20.495 --> 31:21.872
on Korean software?

31:21.896 --> 31:25.233
I just assumed we always use
our own because we have it.

31:25.234 --> 31:28.279
Not entirely. We use them
because NSA thinks that

31:28.303 --> 31:30.382
foreign-designed software
can lead to security breaches,

31:30.406 --> 31:33.184
even if they were designed
by a longtime ally.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.387
Min-hee said that
it's the deal point that

31:35.411 --> 31:37.555
President Choi wanted to address,

31:37.579 --> 31:39.557
but for some reason
it's never been part of

31:39.581 --> 31:43.061
the negotiation.
Meaning that if we could get NSA

31:43.085 --> 31:44.329
to move off the restriction,

31:44.353 --> 31:46.605
I think we can get
Choi to sign the deal.

31:46.629 --> 31:47.627
Yeah.

31:47.628 --> 31:50.575
Getting NSA
to ease off restrictions,

31:51.593 --> 31:54.239
- it's not a slam dunk.
- Min-hee said

31:54.263 --> 31:58.109
that Korea survived
the recession of 2008

31:58.133 --> 32:01.346
by focusing on domestic
production, but then

32:01.370 --> 32:03.648
the economy stagnated, they
faced a lot more competition,

32:03.672 --> 32:04.983
which is why they've become

32:05.007 --> 32:07.485
the world leader in 5G technology.

32:07.509 --> 32:09.688
Maybe if you argue the
value of competition.

32:09.712 --> 32:12.057
Yes. Yes.

32:12.081 --> 32:14.359
Because

32:14.383 --> 32:17.062
the best way to regulate capitalism

32:17.086 --> 32:20.165
is to force it to regulate itself.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.833
Is that Adam Smith?

32:21.857 --> 32:23.168
No, it's me.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.106
Maybe it's Adam Smith. 
I don't know.

32:28.130 --> 32:30.108
But I'm going to be 
up in a few minutes.

32:30.132 --> 32:31.609
I just, I want to call Russell.

32:31.633 --> 32:33.144
- So that's it. You're done?
- Yep.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.846
- Yeah.
- Hey.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.515
We just got word
that every single application

32:37.539 --> 32:39.317
was accepted by 
the Swedish embassy.

32:39.341 --> 32:41.453
- Wha... Damn. Way to go.
- I know.

32:41.477 --> 32:43.421
I know. It's a huge win.

32:43.445 --> 32:46.458
Well, here's to
the hundreds of people

32:46.482 --> 32:49.094
who get to start a new life
because of you.

32:49.118 --> 32:50.295
Because of a lot of people.

32:50.319 --> 32:51.696
OK.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.871
Thank you.

32:56.091 --> 32:58.036
Yeah. Oh. I'm sorry.

32:58.060 --> 33:00.338
- Careful. I got it.
- So sorry. Here.

33:00.362 --> 33:03.975
Hey, so,

33:03.999 --> 33:07.479
uh, I don't want to
make a, like, a big deal

33:07.503 --> 33:09.614
out of this or anything,
but I just wanted to say

33:09.638 --> 33:12.016
that I've been really enjoying

33:12.040 --> 33:14.219
getting to know you.

33:16.545 --> 33:18.656
I really like you.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.092
But, look, I know
that we haven't talked about

33:21.116 --> 33:24.462
being exclusive,
but I just wanted you to know

33:24.486 --> 33:27.332
that I'm not, that
I'm just saying,

33:27.356 --> 33:29.601
I only want to see you.

33:29.625 --> 33:32.470
I don't know about you,
but I've been feeling like

33:32.494 --> 33:36.074
this could maybe
be the start of something real.

33:36.098 --> 33:37.642
- You know?
- Yeah.

33:37.666 --> 33:39.811
Wow.

33:39.835 --> 33:42.954
What what do you think?

33:58.353 --> 34:00.498
Hi.

34:00.522 --> 34:01.666
Hi.

34:01.690 --> 34:03.601
Sorry it's late.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.973
I guess you're probably
getting ready to go.

34:08.996 --> 34:10.348
But,

34:14.335 --> 34:16.547
can you do me a favour?

34:16.572 --> 34:20.591
I need you to tell me
that we are done.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.821
'Cause

34:22.844 --> 34:24.289
I've been trying to move on

34:24.313 --> 34:26.824
with someone who,

34:26.849 --> 34:28.293
well, he lives here.

34:28.317 --> 34:31.295
He lives in this city,

34:31.320 --> 34:33.231
he's not running away to the jungle

34:33.255 --> 34:36.333
to build houses.

34:36.358 --> 34:38.937
He's nice to me.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.338
He cares about me.

34:40.362 --> 34:43.141
It's not complicated.

34:43.165 --> 34:45.382
I'm lucky to have him in my life

34:46.668 --> 34:49.020
and then you show up, you are back.

34:50.739 --> 34:52.317
I just, I see...

34:52.341 --> 34:55.018
Every time I see you, I just...

34:55.043 --> 34:56.893
Every time you see me, what?

35:00.515 --> 35:02.260
I just want

35:02.284 --> 35:03.701
to...

35:46.065 --> 35:49.191
My son listens to this stuff
on repeat. It grows on you.

35:49.192 --> 35:50.336
It's a little overproduced.

35:50.360 --> 35:52.138
Your hair's a little overproduced.

Thank you so much. I love you all.

36:38.308 --> 36:41.240
Ms Weldon. 
I'm so glad that you came.

36:41.260 --> 36:45.024
Madam President. Well, thank you
so much for the invitation.

36:45.048 --> 36:46.526
This is my husband Damon.

36:46.550 --> 36:47.927
So nice to meet you.

36:47.951 --> 36:49.176
It's a pleasure, Madam President.

36:49.177 --> 36:51.589
Can I steal her for a minute?
And I promise you'll be back

36:51.613 --> 36:52.757
before the beef Wellington.

36:54.549 --> 36:56.661
Ms Kwon, that was terrific.

36:56.685 --> 36:58.863
Oh, thank you so much. Michael
Barnow, advisor to the President.

36:58.887 --> 37:02.667
May I introduce you to Senators
Jane Stulbarg and Linda Furey?

37:02.691 --> 37:04.702
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms Kwon.

37:04.726 --> 37:06.004
That was probably the most fun

37:06.028 --> 37:07.338
I've ever had at the White House.

37:07.362 --> 37:09.908
- Thank you.
- If you have a moment, they would love

37:09.932 --> 37:11.910
to discuss the benefits
of American manufacturing

37:11.934 --> 37:14.379
- in their home states.
- Mm. Sounds intriguing.

37:14.403 --> 37:17.048
- Why don't you join me and my husband?
- Why, thank you.

37:17.072 --> 37:19.050
<i>Chelsea, you've met</i>

37:19.074 --> 37:21.753
my chief of staff Russell Jackson.

37:21.777 --> 37:22.921
Sure have.

37:22.945 --> 37:24.923
The president and I
just wanted you to know

37:24.947 --> 37:27.025
that the new Free Trade
Agreement with South Korea

37:27.049 --> 37:28.192
is back on track.

37:28.216 --> 37:29.360
Congratulations.

37:29.384 --> 37:31.462
With a few amendments.

37:31.486 --> 37:33.798
Yeah, we will be allowing
South Korean software

37:33.822 --> 37:35.133
and digital applications

37:35.157 --> 37:38.369
to enter the American market.

37:38.393 --> 37:40.471
You're familiar with HuySo?

37:40.495 --> 37:44.275
A new streaming platform
out of South Korea, of course.

37:44.299 --> 37:45.777
Yeah, very similar to YoureVid,

37:45.801 --> 37:47.712
but with a few key differences.

37:47.736 --> 37:51.049
Strict community guidelines
for misinformation and abuse,

37:51.073 --> 37:54.385
verified news sources,
human moderators.

37:54.409 --> 37:57.588
I know.
I don't know how they do it.

37:57.612 --> 37:58.923
We were impressed.

37:58.947 --> 38:01.793
And no algorithmically-generated
autoplays

38:01.817 --> 38:03.728
or deepfakes.

38:03.752 --> 38:06.264
I get it. But this is a model

38:06.288 --> 38:07.598
that works for South Korea.

38:07.622 --> 38:09.600
Like gangbusters.

38:09.624 --> 38:10.935
It's really taking off.

38:10.959 --> 38:12.270
Well, especially
in the 18-35 demographic.

38:12.294 --> 38:14.072
- Yeah.
- It turns out

38:14.096 --> 38:16.441
young South Koreans vastly
prefer HuySo over YoureVid

38:16.465 --> 38:18.576
'cause the interface is simpler

38:18.600 --> 38:20.144
and the videos have better resolution,

38:20.168 --> 38:21.779
but mainly

38:21.803 --> 38:24.949
because they find the content
more trustworthy.

38:24.973 --> 38:27.285
HuySo will be aggressively moving

38:27.309 --> 38:29.020
into the U.S.

38:29.044 --> 38:31.856
- once the new trade deal is signed.
- Can I

38:31.880 --> 38:33.691
just ask, Madam President...

38:33.715 --> 38:35.526
Yeah. Have you considered

38:35.550 --> 38:38.329
what it'll be like campaigning

38:38.353 --> 38:39.998
for a second term as the president

38:40.022 --> 38:42.100
who threatened free speech

38:42.124 --> 38:44.002
in favour

38:44.026 --> 38:45.803
of a foreign company?

38:45.827 --> 38:48.740
I'm willing to face the
tribunal, as long as voters

38:48.764 --> 38:51.815
have reliable information
to make their decision.

38:52.734 --> 38:53.878
Well, and

38:53.902 --> 38:55.713
with streaming platforms

38:55.737 --> 38:57.882
operating like HuySo, they'll get it.

38:57.906 --> 38:59.050
Madam President?

38:59.074 --> 39:01.959
I'm so sorry. I have
to get back. Thank you.

39:04.980 --> 39:06.624
So, basically,

39:06.648 --> 39:09.494
shift the entire culture
of the Internet

39:09.518 --> 39:12.797
in two weeks. Or do I get four?

39:12.821 --> 39:14.298
What do you guys like to say,

39:14.322 --> 39:16.473
move fast and break things?

39:17.359 --> 39:19.604
You're a great American company.

39:19.628 --> 39:21.812
We'd like to see you stay that way.

39:26.902 --> 39:30.148
So, I don't know what Mike did,
but looks like the senators

39:30.172 --> 39:32.817
are swapping baby photos
with the first family.

39:32.841 --> 39:34.886
Looks like

39:34.910 --> 39:36.587
two more votes
for my FTC commissioner.

39:36.611 --> 39:37.822
Take that,

39:37.846 --> 39:40.992
deepfake makers.

39:41.016 --> 39:43.394
I'm not sure that's what
they call themselves.

39:43.418 --> 39:45.663
Thank you so much for spending
the time, Mr President.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.899
Sung-hoon. Thank you
for the introduction.

39:47.923 --> 39:49.834
- Very cool ladies.
- Ms Kwon,

39:49.858 --> 39:51.469
can I just say, my son
is such a huge fan.

39:51.493 --> 39:53.071
I don't think he would
forgive me if I didn't ask

39:53.095 --> 39:54.238
for an autograph.

39:54.262 --> 39:55.573
Of course.

39:55.597 --> 39:57.815
- What's your son's name?
- Michael.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.546
You know what? Just "Mike."

40:01.570 --> 40:02.886
"B."

40:04.473 --> 40:06.523
- Awesome. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

40:36.104 --> 40:38.116
- Mr Vice President.
- Ms Ballard.

40:38.140 --> 40:40.618
Congratulations on 
your confirmation.

40:40.642 --> 40:42.753
Thanks to your auspicious
tie-breaking vote.

40:42.777 --> 40:43.921
Just exercising

40:43.945 --> 40:45.756
my constitutional duty.

40:45.780 --> 40:47.698
It's great to have you aboard.

40:50.185 --> 40:52.130
Quite a week for you, Mr VP.

40:52.154 --> 40:54.632
I'm a little surprised
to see you here.

40:54.656 --> 40:56.300
No, I love the East Room.

40:56.324 --> 40:57.502
Did you know Nixon

40:57.526 --> 41:00.138
delivered his farewell address here?

41:00.162 --> 41:03.814
Hmm. Well, I'm telling
you this as a friend.

41:04.699 --> 41:07.912
68% of the public is
against impeachment.

41:07.936 --> 41:10.821
The American people
aren't with you on this.

41:12.073 --> 41:15.753
I have one superpower, Carlos.

41:15.777 --> 41:19.229
I never, ever quit.

41:21.516 --> 41:24.662
- Is this guilty dogs?
- No. And what?

41:24.686 --> 41:26.664
It's that guy, Shawn Olson.

41:26.688 --> 41:29.000
He got banned from YoureVid
and now he's ranting

41:29.024 --> 41:31.869
at some dude for stealing
his parking spot.

41:31.893 --> 41:33.371
- How about some eggs?
- Oh, I love this.

41:35.297 --> 41:37.441
Hey! Ow! Stinking communist!

41:38.867 --> 41:40.344
What's that?

41:40.368 --> 41:42.880
It's that crazy guy Shawn Olson.

41:42.904 --> 41:45.416
He's freaking out in a parking lot.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.552
Communist! Hey! God! Snowflake!

41:47.576 --> 41:49.353
Oh, my God.

41:49.377 --> 41:52.890
Wow, that's hilarious, yeah.

41:52.914 --> 41:54.592
Wait, you don't 
want to see the end?

41:54.616 --> 41:56.861
I mean, the bad guy
has egg on his face.

41:56.885 --> 41:59.530
It's good enough for me.

41:59.554 --> 42:01.032
Wait, what is that?

42:01.056 --> 42:03.868
- What?
- This.

42:03.892 --> 42:05.203
That?

42:05.227 --> 42:06.704
- That.
- Passion fruit.

42:06.728 --> 42:09.807
What? I got it for you because,

42:09.831 --> 42:12.176
well, you know, 
in case you were sad

42:12.200 --> 42:15.379
about skipping Guyana.

42:15.403 --> 42:17.554
Are you?
