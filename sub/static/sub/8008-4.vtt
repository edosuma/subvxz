00:45.212 --> 00:46.714
- Stools.
- Huh?

00:47.089 --> 00:48.841
They're stools, not chairs.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.467
Well, can I have a bigger stool?

Is someone throwing mushrooms?

01:01.812 --> 01:02.984
Yes, very good!

01:02.980 --> 01:08.032
It is a mushroom, or a toadstool.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.696
That's why you're sitting on stools.

That's where you two come in.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.470
Okay, the flying mushroom
came from that direction,

01:34.469 --> 01:37.723
so I want you two to head that way
until you find one.

01:37.848 --> 01:38.849

we're walking in this direction.

We never walk in this direction.

Hey, how long do you think
capturing a flying mushroom takes?

02:17.429 --> 02:19.306
Well, we got to find one first.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.141
Yeah, that too. How long?

02:23.060 --> 02:27.065
Hmm. An hour to capture,
and if we don't find one by dinner,

it's not flying.
