PLEASE HELP ME!

00:30.000 --> 00:30.484
PLEASE HELP ME!

00:30.517 --> 00:32.488

00:32.521 --> 00:34.424
ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER.
AFTER YOU.

00:34.457 --> 00:35.593
THERE IS NO MORE MONEY.
HE'S NOT DOING HIS JOB.

00:35.626 --> 00:37.429
THIS PLACE IS
A DISASTER ZONE!

00:37.462 --> 00:39.198
I PUT SO MUCH INTO IT.

00:39.232 --> 00:41.469
BUT TO GET THESE RESTAURANTS
BACK ON TRACK,

00:41.503 --> 00:43.906
CHEF RAMSAY WILL HOLD
NOTHING BACK.

00:43.940 --> 00:48.982
NEVER EVER, EVER,
EVER, MET SOMEONE

00:49.015 --> 00:50.685
I BELIEVE IN
AS LITTLE AS YOU.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.156
IT WILL BE INTENSE.

00:53.189 --> 00:55.159
TOUCH THE WALL,
YOU DIRTY PIG!

00:55.192 --> 00:56.962
WHAT DO WE NEED,
A DEATH IN THE RESTAURANT

00:56.995 --> 00:58.230
BEFORE SOME
GETS A GRIP?

00:58.264 --> 00:59.967
I THOUGHT YOUR FOOD
WAS CRAP.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.000
I'D RATHER HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION DOWNSTAIRS.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.269
I'D RATHER HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION DOWNSTAIRS.

01:01.302 --> 01:02.738
IT WILL BE EMOTIONAL.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.341
YOU'RE A!

01:04.374 --> 01:06.545
THAT'S IT.
SERIOUSLY, I'M PISSED OFF.

01:06.578 --> 01:07.613
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

01:07.646 --> 01:08.781
WHY DID YOU KEEP EATING

01:08.815 --> 01:10.217
IF IT WAS THAT BAD?

01:10.250 --> 01:11.519
GO, JUST GO!

01:11.553 --> 01:13.255
AND IT WILL BE SHOCKING.

01:13.289 --> 01:14.658
FIRE THEM ON THE SPOT.

01:14.691 --> 01:16.427
OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THEM!

01:16.461 --> 01:19.299
IT'S RANCID, IT'S ROTTEN.
I'VE EATEN IT!

01:19.332 --> 01:21.202
I FEEL LIKE SPITTING
ON BOTH OF THEM.

01:21.235 --> 01:23.306
I THINK THIS PLACE WOULD RUN
BETTER WITHOUT YOU.

01:23.339 --> 01:25.676
CAN YOU GO TELL THEM
THAT THE KITCHEN IS CLOSED.

01:25.709 --> 01:27.145
WE'RE SHUT!

01:27.178 --> 01:28.714
THIS IS THE LUCKIEST DAY
OF THEIR LIVES.

01:28.748 --> 01:29.750
WE'RE SHUT FOR THE NIGHT.

01:29.783 --> 01:30.000
WE'RE SHUT FOR THE NIGHT!

01:30.000 --> 01:31.819
WE'RE SHUT FOR THE NIGHT!

01:31.853 --> 01:33.857
WE WILL MAKE THIS
A SUCCESS.

01:33.890 --> 01:36.060
PUT YOUR HAND UP
AND SWEAR TO GOD.

01:36.093 --> 01:38.331
IN THE END, YOU WILL SEE
DRAMATIC TURNAROUNDS...

01:38.364 --> 01:41.736
AREN'T THEY HORRIBLE?

01:41.770 --> 01:43.873
OF NOT JUST
THE RESTAURANTS...

01:43.907 --> 01:45.476
OOH!

01:45.510 --> 01:47.946
OH, I LIKE THIS!
OH, IT'S FANTASTIC.

01:47.980 --> 01:50.184
BUT THE PEOPLE
WHO WORK IN THEM.

01:50.217 --> 01:52.120
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU, MAN,
THE REST OF MY LIFE, BRO.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.589
YOU'RE THE BEST, MAN.

01:53.623 --> 01:55.592
AND WHILE MOST APPRECIATE
HIS HELP....

01:55.626 --> 01:58.297
GOD BLESS YOU.
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL PERSON.

01:58.330 --> 01:59.766
OTHERS AREN'T SO GRATEFUL.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.000
THIS IS MY!

02:00.000 --> 02:01.202
THIS IS MY!

02:01.235 --> 02:03.506
CHEF, I KNOW YOU CAN
HEAR ME, DON'T RUN!

02:03.540 --> 02:04.674
WHY IS THIS GUY HERE?!

02:04.708 --> 02:05.943
WHO THE  ARE YOU

02:05.976 --> 02:07.179
TO TURN AROUND AND TELL ME

02:07.212 --> 02:08.648
WHEN YOU WORK LIKE A PIG?

02:08.681 --> 02:10.150
YOU  PIG!

02:10.184 --> 02:12.755
GOOD-BYE, CHEF!
GOOD LUCK...LOSER!

02:12.788 --> 02:14.524
GET READY AS CHEF RAMSAY

02:14.558 --> 02:16.929
TURNS AMERICA'S
KITCHEN NIGHTMARES...

02:16.962 --> 02:18.865
THANK GOD
FOR WHAT I'M ABOUT TO RECEIVE,

02:18.898 --> 02:20.801
MAY THE LORD NOT KILL ME
WITH FOOD POISONING.

02:20.835 --> 02:22.738
BACK INTO DREAMS.

02:22.772 --> 02:25.676
PLEASE DO NOT SCREW IT UP.

02:42.070 --> 02:44.307
TONIGHT ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,

02:44.341 --> 02:46.678
GORDON HELPS TO AN OLD
ITALIAN EATERY.

02:46.712 --> 02:48.481
WELL, THIS ONE'S GONNA BE
INTERESTING, ISN'T IT?

02:48.515 --> 02:49.482
TO FIND A FAMILY

02:49.516 --> 02:51.319
AND A RESTAURANT IN CRISIS.

02:51.353 --> 02:53.222
YOU CAN BECOME FAMOUS
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS

02:53.256 --> 02:55.359
FOR  POISONING
HALF OF BABYLON.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.229
TINA, THE OWNER, IS A WRECK.

02:57.263 --> 02:58.999
I WANT TO CRY
OR COMMIT BLOODY MURDER.

02:59.032 --> 03:00.000
AND HER BROTHER
DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.335
AND HER BROTHER
DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE.

03:01.369 --> 03:03.306
INSTEAD OF BUYING A STOVE,
I BOUGHT A SUIT, YOU KNOW?

03:03.339 --> 03:06.278
HE'S 250-POUND
SPOILED BABY.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.147
HE'S A LUNATIC.
YOU AIN'T GOT ME SCARED!

03:08.181 --> 03:10.184
YOU AIN'T GOT ME SCARED!
GOOD, GOOD!

03:10.217 --> 03:12.321
WITH ONLY ONE WEEK
TO TURN IT AROUND,

03:12.354 --> 03:14.157
GORDON MUST PULL
THIS FAMILY TOGETHER.

03:14.191 --> 03:15.693
HOLY MACKEREL.

03:15.726 --> 03:17.930
BUT IT WILL BE
A MONUMENTAL CHALLENGE.

03:17.963 --> 03:19.499
YOU HAVE TO STAY
OUT OF IT.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.901
THE CHEF'S WORN DOWN.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.370
WHEN THE  DISHES
ARE READY,

03:22.404 --> 03:24.208
THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE GONNA
COME OUT!

03:24.241 --> 03:26.244
AND THE KITCHEN'S WORN OUT.

03:26.277 --> 03:28.147
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU WORK
IN THAT -HOLE.

03:28.180 --> 03:30.000
THIS IS MY ONE WORKING OVEN,
THAT'S IT.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.484
THIS IS MY ONE WORKING OVEN,
THAT'S IT.

03:30.518 --> 03:32.321
THE MANAGER'S A TYRANT.

03:32.354 --> 03:34.424
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I'M GETTING HOT-HEADED?!

03:34.457 --> 03:36.561
- GIVE ME THIS  MALLET.
- I'LL BANG THE  DOOR!

03:36.595 --> 03:38.531
AND THE STAFF IS READY
TO THROW IN THE TOWEL.

03:38.564 --> 03:40.400
LISTEN TO ME.
GET THEM OUT OF THE WAY!

03:40.434 --> 03:41.903
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
NO, NO, NO.

03:41.936 --> 03:43.138
CAN GORDON UNITE

03:43.172 --> 03:44.507
THIS DYSFUNCTIONAL
FAMILY RESTAURANT?

03:44.541 --> 03:45.743
I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF.

03:45.776 --> 03:46.979
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

03:47.012 --> 03:48.014
TRY TO COME BACK
NEXT WEEK

03:48.047 --> 03:49.415
FOR THE BAKED CLAMS.

03:49.449 --> 03:52.087
AND GET THEIR HOUSE
BACK IN ORDER.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.823
YOU!

03:53.856 --> 03:58.097
THAT'S COMING UP
ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

03:58.130 --> 04:00.000
BABYLON, NEW YORK,
A QUAINT VILLAGE

04:00.000 --> 04:01.770
BABYLON, NEW YORK,
A QUAINT VILLAGE

04:01.803 --> 04:04.340
ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE
OF LONG ISLAND

04:04.374 --> 04:06.978
AND HOME TO A NUMBER
OF ITALIAN RESTAURANTS.

04:07.012 --> 04:09.349
BUT THERE IS ONE
FAMILY ESTABLISHMENT

04:09.383 --> 04:11.252
THAT NEEDS
GORDON RAMSAY'S HELP

04:11.286 --> 04:12.888
MORE THAN ANY OTHER.

04:12.922 --> 04:14.324
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

04:14.357 --> 04:16.528
I'M THE OWNER
OF THIS RESTAURANT, PETER'S.

04:16.561 --> 04:18.398
- THERE'S A LOT OF STRESS.
- THIS PLACE IS A  MESS.

04:18.431 --> 04:19.600
I'M ALL OVER THE PLACE.

04:19.633 --> 04:20.768
IT'S PRETTY OPEN RIGHT NOW.

04:20.801 --> 04:22.438
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

04:22.471 --> 04:24.041
NO ONE THINKS
I'M THE OWNER IN HERE.

04:24.074 --> 04:24.841
THEY ALL THINK
IT'S MY BROTHER,

04:24.875 --> 04:27.346
'CAUSE HE'S THE HOST.

04:27.379 --> 04:29.149
COME ON, PETER, HELP!
YEAH.

04:29.182 --> 04:30.000
WHAT THE?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.052
WHAT THE?

04:32.889 --> 04:35.059
THERE ARE A LOT
OF RESTAURANT OWNERS

04:35.092 --> 04:36.461
THAT--THEY'RE MARRIED
TO THEIR BUSINESS DAY AND NIGHT.

04:36.494 --> 04:39.266
BUT I CHOOSE NOT TO LIVE
MY LIFE THAT WAY.

04:39.299 --> 04:41.736
I'M THE ONLY SON.
THAT'S ME.

04:41.769 --> 04:43.606
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHO PETER THINKS HE IS.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.778
HONESTLY, I THINK
HE'S HOPING FOR A SHOT

04:46.812 --> 04:47.914
AT THE NEXTGOODFELLASMOVIE.

04:49.215 --> 04:50.517
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
I WAS OUT,

04:50.551 --> 04:52.254
THEY PULL ME BACK IN.

04:52.288 --> 04:54.324
THAT WAS A GREAT MOVIE,
RIGHT?
YEAH, THAT WAS AWESOME.

04:54.358 --> 04:57.629
WE'RE A CLOSE FAMILY.
WE'RE A CLOSE FAMILY.

04:57.663 --> 05:00.000
IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.603
IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

05:03.840 --> 05:07.078
I BELIEVE PETER IS A CORE
PROBLEM OF THE RESTAURANT.

05:07.112 --> 05:08.749
WHO THE  IS HE?!

05:08.782 --> 05:10.685
YOU KNOW, I'M PASSIONATE.
I'M ITALIAN, I YELL.

05:10.718 --> 05:12.121
GETTING ON ME.
WHY IS THIS GUY HERE?!

05:12.154 --> 05:13.790
TWO MINUTES LATER,
I'M OVER IT.

05:13.823 --> 05:15.493
COME ON, LET ME HUG IT OUT
WITH YOU.

05:15.526 --> 05:17.697
LET'S HUG IT OUT,
LET'S HUG IT OUT, COME ON.

05:17.730 --> 05:19.466
HE TAKES ADVANTAGE
OF THE PLACE.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.138
CAN I HAVE A CAPPUCCINO
FROM HERE, PLEASE?

05:22.171 --> 05:24.341
I TAKE SO MUCH PRIDE
IN MYSELF, MY APPEARANCE,

05:24.374 --> 05:26.344
MY CAR, MY CLOTHES.

05:26.377 --> 05:28.214
DO I GOT SAUCE
ON MY SUIT?

05:28.248 --> 05:29.750
I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF,
AND IT SHOWS.

05:29.784 --> 05:30.000
YOU CAN PUT YOUR HANDS
ON ME.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.885
YOU CAN PUT YOUR HANDS
ON ME.

05:30.918 --> 05:32.387
I PROMISE I WON'T BRING YOU UP
ON CHARGES.

05:32.421 --> 05:34.691
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
HA HA HA!

05:34.725 --> 05:36.795
HE'S NOT SO CONCERNED
WITH THE CUSTOMER.

05:36.828 --> 05:38.397
HE'S MORE CONCERNED
WITH THEM NOTICING HIM.

05:38.431 --> 05:40.768
INSTEAD OF BUYING A STOVE,

05:40.802 --> 05:41.904
I BOUGHT A SUIT, YOU KNOW?

05:44.040 --> 05:45.810
THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE
IN THE KITCHEN RIGHT NOW

05:45.843 --> 05:47.145
NEED TO BE SHARPENED.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.352
THERE ARE
THREE OVENS DOWN.

05:51.386 --> 05:53.523
THE OVEN ON THE BOTTOM
IS COMPLETELY OUT.

05:53.557 --> 05:55.460
WE HAVE A BROILER
THAT'S NOT WORKING.

05:55.493 --> 05:57.296
WHEN I GOT DRESSED TONIGHT,

05:57.329 --> 05:58.598
I FELT LIKE
I SHOULD'VE BEEN IN FLORIDA.

05:58.631 --> 06:00.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:00.000 --> 06:00.167
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:00.201 --> 06:01.403
THE WHOLE FAMILY
IS THROWING EVERYTHING

06:01.436 --> 06:02.304
ON TINA'S SHOULDERS.

06:02.337 --> 06:04.141
AND I DON'T THINK
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.

06:04.174 --> 06:06.010
OKAY, I DON'T GIVE
A  IF IT BROKE,

06:06.044 --> 06:07.780
BUT I HAVE TO HAVE
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN

06:07.813 --> 06:10.618
OVER A DAMN
CANDLE HOLDER!

06:10.651 --> 06:12.721
THIS RESTAURANT WAS ONE

06:12.754 --> 06:14.525
OF THE TOP RESTAURANTS
IN THE VILLAGE HERE.

06:14.558 --> 06:17.630
AND IT'S JUST REALLY
SLOWLY DECLINED.

06:17.663 --> 06:19.233
THE RESTAURANT
IS NOT MAKING THE MONEY

06:19.266 --> 06:20.635
THAT IT WAS MAKING.

06:20.668 --> 06:22.138
RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT PAYING
THE BILLS.

06:22.171 --> 06:23.807
DO ME A FAVOR.
GO TAKE A WALK.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.309
- HOW'S THAT?
- GO TAKE A  WALK.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.545
WE'RE GETTING PHONE CALLS.

06:26.578 --> 06:28.214
THE GUY HAS NOT
STOPPED CALLING,

06:28.248 --> 06:30.000
AND MY FATHER'S MAKING
THE SITUATION WORSE.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.885
AND MY FATHER'S MAKING
THE SITUATION WORSE.

06:30.919 --> 06:33.422
I FEEL THAT MY BUSINESS
IS AT A PIVOTAL POINT.

06:33.456 --> 06:34.825
IT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT

06:34.858 --> 06:36.828
THAT I KNOW THERE ARE
PROBLEMS HERE.

06:36.861 --> 06:38.632
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE, JOHN,
COMING HERE.
YEAH, I DID.

06:38.665 --> 06:41.537
BEFORE I LOSE MY LIFE,
I WOULD SELL THE PLACE.

06:41.570 --> 06:43.640
AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
THAT'S NOT IN MY HEART.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.359
I'M HERE IN BABYLON
IN NEW YORK TO MEET PETER

06:55.393 --> 06:56.895
FROM PETER'S RESTAURANT.

06:56.929 --> 06:58.698
IT'S A FAMILY, SMALL,
QUAINT RESTAURANT.

06:58.731 --> 07:00.000
AND IT'S ON ITS ASS
STRUGGLING BIG TIME.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.303
AND IT'S ON ITS ASS
STRUGGLING BIG TIME.

07:01.336 --> 07:03.472
AND HE SAID
HE WAS GONNA PICK ME UP.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.142
WHERE IS HE?

07:07.980 --> 07:09.349
WHERE IS HE?

07:09.382 --> 07:12.387
COME ON.

07:12.421 --> 07:14.892
THIS CAN'T BE HIM.

07:17.763 --> 07:20.133
WHAT THE  IS THIS?

07:20.167 --> 07:22.171
PETER?
HOW YOU DOING, GORDON?

07:22.204 --> 07:23.440
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
NICE CAR.

07:23.473 --> 07:25.509
HOW ARE YOU?
VERY WELL.

07:25.543 --> 07:27.112
WELCOME TO BABYLON.
YEAH.

07:27.145 --> 07:28.581
HOW ARE YOU?
VERY WELL, THANK YOU.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.883
AND YOU?
GOOD, GREAT, MAN.

07:29.917 --> 07:30.000
YOU LOOK WELL.
THANK YOU, SO DO YOU.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.353
YOU LOOK WELL.
THANK YOU, SO DO YOU.

07:31.386 --> 07:32.822
FROM THE MINUTE WE MET,

07:32.855 --> 07:34.324
IT WAS LIKE SUPERMAN ARRIVED.

SO I'M VERY EXCITED.

07:35.793 --> 07:36.996
COME ON IN.

07:37.029 --> 07:38.798
I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN HOLLYWOOD.

07:41.035 --> 07:43.006

LITTLE TOWN.

07:43.039 --> 07:44.708
SO HERE IT IS.

07:44.742 --> 07:46.778

07:46.811 --> 07:47.780
THANK YOU.

07:47.813 --> 07:49.449

07:49.483 --> 07:51.085
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU

07:54.157 --> 07:55.593

HOW TO TAKE HIM, BUT...

08:03.907 --> 08:05.476

HOW NICE, ALL THE FAMILY
WORKING TOGETHER.

08:09.349 --> 08:10.785
ABSOLUTELY.

08:10.818 --> 08:12.387
MOM, DAD, BIG BROTHER,
LITTLE SISTER.

08:12.421 --> 08:13.790
WHEN GORDON GOT HERE,

08:13.823 --> 08:16.094
I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING HIM.

08:16.127 --> 08:17.697
I MEAN, HE'S A SMART GUY.
HE'S A GOOD LOOKING GUY.

08:17.730 --> 08:18.865
HE'S CHARISMATIC.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.235
SO WHO'S THE CHEF?
ROBERT.

08:21.269 --> 08:22.705
ROBERT, GORDON RAMSAY.

08:22.738 --> 08:23.873
HOW ARE YOU?
A PLEASURE.

08:23.907 --> 08:25.242
THIS IS ROBERT OSERA.

08:25.276 --> 08:26.578
AND YOU'RE HEAD CHEF.
I'M THE HEAD CHEF.

08:26.611 --> 08:27.914
EXCELLENT.

08:27.947 --> 08:29.149
THESE ARE MY TWO BEST FRIENDS,
JERRY AND JERRY.

08:29.183 --> 08:30.000
JERRY AND JERRY.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.250
JERRY AND JERRY.

08:30.284 --> 08:31.386
HI, HOW YOU DOING?
GOOD.

08:31.419 --> 08:32.621
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

08:32.655 --> 08:34.458
IF THEY DON'T LIKE
THE FOOD, THEY GO BEAT--

08:34.491 --> 08:36.127
JERRY AND JERRY BEAT
THE  OUT OF THEM.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.496
I FEEL HONORED.

08:37.529 --> 08:39.399
I'VE BEEN INTRODUCED
TO THE MOB.

08:39.432 --> 08:40.835
WELL, THIS ONE'S GONNA
BE INTERESTING, ISN'T IT?

08:40.868 --> 08:43.339
ME.

08:43.373 --> 08:45.409
YOU DECIDED?
YEAH.

08:45.443 --> 08:46.911
I'LL START WITH
THE CRAB CAKE PLEASE.

08:46.946 --> 08:47.880
CRAB CAKES.
THANK YOU.

08:47.913 --> 08:48.815
OKAY.
AND THEN ONE
OF MY FAVORITES.

08:48.849 --> 08:49.649
LOBSTER RAVIOLI.

08:49.683 --> 08:50.918
VERY GOOD.
LOVELY.

08:50.952 --> 08:52.254
THANK YOU, MY MAN.

08:52.287 --> 08:53.556
I'M SORRY.
YOUR FIRST NAME WAS?

08:53.590 --> 08:54.458
ANGELO.
ANGELO.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.894
GENTLEMEN, I'VE GOT

08:55.927 --> 08:58.197
RAMSAY'S ORDER, PLEASE.

09:01.636 --> 09:03.774
OKAY, HERE'S THE CRAB CAKES.
LOVELY, THANK YOU.

09:03.807 --> 09:05.309
OKAY, THIS IS
A SPICY DIJON SAUCE.

09:05.343 --> 09:06.712
THE CRAB CAKES
ARE HOMEMADE.

09:06.745 --> 09:07.780
THEY ARE HOMEMADE, YES.

09:07.813 --> 09:11.686
THANK YOU.
ENJOY.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.055
LOOKS TERRIBLE,
THE SALAD.

09:14.425 --> 09:15.994
IS THIS SALAD FRESH?

09:16.027 --> 09:17.563
THERE'S ALL THAT LITTLE
BITS IN THERE.

09:17.596 --> 09:20.067
IT'S, LIKE, ROTTEN.
HUH?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.804
HOW OLD IS
THAT SALAD?

09:21.837 --> 09:23.339
TAKE IT BACK BEFORE SOMETHING
JUMPS OUT OF THERE.

09:23.373 --> 09:24.675
I'LL JUST TASTE
THE CRAB CAKE.

09:24.708 --> 09:25.643
AND, I MEAN,
IT'S ROTTEN, ISN'T IT?

09:25.676 --> 09:28.514
YES.
DAMN.

09:28.548 --> 09:30.000
THIS IS RIDICULOUS, MAN.
LOOK AT THE--

09:30.000 --> 09:30.985
THIS IS RIDICULOUS, MAN.
LOOK AT THE--

09:31.019 --> 09:34.224
HOW OLD IS THIS SALAD?
YOU MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A MORON.

09:34.257 --> 09:36.428
JESUS.

09:41.603 --> 09:43.372
UM, ANGELO.
YES.

09:43.406 --> 09:45.310
I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU
IN AN AWKWARD POSITION,

09:45.343 --> 09:46.544
BUT THAT'S STONE COLD
IN THE MIDDLE,

09:46.578 --> 09:48.448
AND THAT'S NOT FRESH
CRAB MEAT.

09:48.482 --> 09:50.051
VERY GROSS.

09:50.084 --> 09:53.022
OKAY,
I'LL LET HIM KNOW.
YEAH.

09:53.056 --> 09:54.792
WHEN YOU COME INTO
AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT,

09:54.825 --> 09:56.228
YOU WANT TO IDENTIFY

09:56.261 --> 09:57.897
THAT THE FOOD
IS FRESH INSTANTLY.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.967
CRAB CAKE COLD.

10:01.369 --> 10:03.907
NOT A GOOD START.

10:05.843 --> 10:07.379
HE'S GONNA KNOCK
THE RAVIOLI?

10:07.412 --> 10:08.314
WHAT IS HE GONNA KNOCK
ABOUT THE RAVIOLI?

10:08.348 --> 10:10.484
THEY'RE GOOD, NO?

10:10.518 --> 10:12.087
YEAH.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.558
THANK YOU.

10:14.591 --> 10:16.695
WELL, I DON'T NEED
ANY PARSLEY.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.872
THAT'S NOT EVEN LOBSTER.

10:22.906 --> 10:25.376
THAT'S JUST LIKE BABY FOOD
INSIDE GUNK.

10:25.409 --> 10:27.146
WHO GARNISHED
THAT DISH?

10:27.179 --> 10:29.750
WHAT?
WHO GARNISHED THAT DISH?

10:29.783 --> 10:30.000
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.452
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

10:31.486 --> 10:32.955
YOU'RE PUTTING HALF A POUND
OF PARSLEY ON MY PLATE.

10:32.988 --> 10:33.623
HE SAID,
"WOW, ENOUGH PARSLEY

10:33.657 --> 10:35.126
ON THIS DISH?"

10:35.159 --> 10:37.195
FIRST OF ALL,
I PUT THE PARSLEY ON.

10:37.229 --> 10:38.464
THAT'S MY JOB, AND I'LL DECIDE
WHAT GOES ON IT.

10:38.498 --> 10:39.533
IT AIN'T YOUR PROBLEM.

10:39.567 --> 10:40.869
YEAH, BUT I DON'T NEED

10:40.902 --> 10:42.405
TO HEAR CRITICISM,
WHICH I ALREADY KNOW.

10:42.438 --> 10:43.472
TELL YOU TELL HIM,
"JOHN DID IT.

10:43.506 --> 10:44.641
GO YELL AT HIM."

10:46.946 --> 10:49.049
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:49.082 --> 10:50.952
IT'S CRAZINESS.
IT'S CHAOS.

10:50.985 --> 10:53.222
AT TIMES, I COULD SHOOT
EVERY PERSON IN HERE.

10:53.256 --> 10:54.525
GENTLEMEN...
GENTLEMEN...

10:54.558 --> 10:55.493
IT'S OVER,
IT'S OVER.

10:55.527 --> 10:57.229
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:57.263 --> 10:58.999
JOHN THE SOUS CHEF
IS INSULTED OVER THE PARSLEY.

10:59.032 --> 11:00.000
I'M GONNA GO DIFFUSE
A FIGHT

11:00.000 --> 11:00.902
I'M GONNA GO DIFFUSE
A FIGHT

11:00.935 --> 11:02.071
IN THIS KITCHEN
RIGHT NOW.

11:02.104 --> 11:05.009
EXCUSE ME.

11:06.278 --> 11:09.350
GET OUT OF HERE!

11:09.383 --> 11:11.853
WHAT ON EARTH?

11:11.886 --> 11:13.523
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING, ANGELO?

11:13.557 --> 11:15.560
ALL THE  TIME.

11:15.593 --> 11:18.898
HOLY SMOKE.
WELCOME TO BABYLON.

11:22.438 --> 11:24.908
NOW THAT GORDON
HAS SAMPLED THEIR MENU,

11:24.942 --> 11:28.180
IT'S TIME FOR A HEART TO HEART
WITH THE PELLEGRINO FAMILY.

11:28.214 --> 11:30.000
I LIKE TO BE TOLD THE TRUTH
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.019
I LIKE TO BE TOLD THE TRUTH
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH.

11:31.052 --> 11:33.256
AND THE QUICKER I GET
TO THE TRUTH,

11:33.289 --> 11:34.759
THE QUICKER I CAN HELP.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.728
SO...MANAGER.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.331
THE WAY I LOOK AT THINGS
IS EVERYONE...

11:38.364 --> 11:39.800
HE COMES IN,
DOESN'T COME IN.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.904
COMES IN, TELLS EVERYONE
HAS TO DO...
MY ROLE IS...

11:41.937 --> 11:43.540
WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING,
INCLUDING ME.

11:43.573 --> 11:44.775
I TRY TO CLEAN UP.
HE WANTS COFFEE.

11:44.809 --> 11:47.179
THEY DON'T LISTEN.
THEY REALLY DON'T.

11:48.682 --> 11:51.420
YOU HAVE TO STAY
OUT OF IT.

11:51.453 --> 11:52.955
HER, SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING

11:52.989 --> 11:54.358
THAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE.

11:54.391 --> 11:56.061
BUT YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
GIVE EMPLOYEES--

11:56.094 --> 11:57.496
HE COMES HERE AND CREATES
MORE PROBLEMS.

12:06.678 --> 12:08.214
THIS IS WHY THE BUSINESS
IS FALLING APART.

12:08.247 --> 12:10.819
- I'M SORRY.
- me.

12:12.188 --> 12:14.357
COMING UP...

12:14.391 --> 12:16.662
ALWAYS FASCINATES ME WHAT YOU
FIND IN THE BACK OF A FRIDGE.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.997
GORDON'S SHOCKING
KITCHEN INVESTIGATION...

12:18.031 --> 12:19.734
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
OUT OF A SCI-FI MOVIE.

12:19.767 --> 12:22.003
LEADS TO A CONFRONTATION
WITH THE FAMILY.

12:22.037 --> 12:23.941
YOU CAN BECOME FAMOUS
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS

12:23.974 --> 12:26.044
FOR  POISONING
HALF OF BABYLON.

12:26.077 --> 12:28.615
WILL GORDON AND PETER
EVER SEE EYE TO EYE?

12:28.648 --> 12:30.000
YOU, THIS PLACE WILL RUN BETTER
WITHOUT YOU.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.520
YOU, THIS PLACE WILL RUN BETTER
WITHOUT YOU.

12:31.553 --> 12:33.490
OR WILL THIS TOUGH GUY

12:33.523 --> 12:35.292
CONTINUE TO WREAK HAVOC
ON HIS RESTAURANT?

12:35.326 --> 12:37.062
YOU!

12:37.095 --> 12:40.201
THAT'S COMING UP
ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

12:47.312 --> 12:48.782
IT'S DAY TWO.

12:48.815 --> 12:51.219
AND GORDON
HAS ALREADY DISCOVERED

12:51.253 --> 12:54.358
THAT THE SPECIALTY
OF THIS RESTAURANT IS ARGUING.

12:54.391 --> 12:57.163
NOW IT'S TIME TO INVESTIGATE
THE STATE OF THE KITCHEN.

12:57.196 --> 12:59.967
BLOODY HELL.

13:00.001 --> 13:01.703
WHAT IS IN THERE?

13:03.439 --> 13:06.278
BREAD ROLLS.
BREAD ROCKS.

13:06.311 --> 13:08.181
TEMPERATURE OF THE FRIDGE
IS NOT EVEN COLD.

13:08.214 --> 13:11.594
STUFF'S ROTTEN.
MOLD.

13:11.594 --> 13:11.620
STUFF'S ROTTEN.
MOLD.

13:11.654 --> 13:14.525
MOLDY DECAY.
ROTTEN ONIONS.

13:14.559 --> 13:17.429
YOU KNOW, THEY LOOK LIKE
CAMEL TURDS.

13:17.462 --> 13:19.800
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
OUT OF A  SCI-FI MOVIE.

13:19.834 --> 13:22.271
OH, MY GOD.

13:22.305 --> 13:23.874
WOULD YOU EAT THAT?

13:23.907 --> 13:26.377
IT'S LIKE THE FRIDGE
HAS DRIPPED ALL OVER IT.

13:26.411 --> 13:28.481
THE WHOLE THING IS
LEAKING HERE.

13:28.515 --> 13:31.119
LAST YEAR'S
RAIN WATER INSIDE.

13:31.153 --> 13:32.922
THING LOOKS LIKE
IT'S ABOUT TO FALL DOWN.

13:39.399 --> 13:41.437
HEY, MATE.
THANKS FOR COMING.

13:41.470 --> 13:41.594
I'M VERY SORRY.
I MADE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

13:41.594 --> 13:43.974
I'M VERY SORRY.
I MADE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

13:44.007 --> 13:45.843
I HAD TO PICK SOMETHING UP--
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:45.877 --> 13:47.947
I HAD TO PICK UP SOMETHING
THAT CAME INDIRECTLY

13:47.981 --> 13:50.117
TO--YOU KNOW, INADVERTENTLY
TO THE WRONG PLACE.

13:50.150 --> 13:52.622
THIS WAS LIKE AN ACT OF GOD
THIS MORNING.
OKAY.

13:52.655 --> 13:54.491
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING

13:54.524 --> 13:56.495
THAT I HOPE WILL OPEN
YOUR  EYES.

13:56.528 --> 13:59.567
TINA, ANGELO AS WELL, YEAH?
HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.803
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WENT
INSIDE A WALK-IN FRIDGE?

14:01.837 --> 14:03.841
THE WALK-IN FRIDGE?
YEAH.

14:03.874 --> 14:05.677
I HAD A HOT FLASH
LAST WEEK.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.213
A HOT FLASH?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:07.246 --> 14:08.515
I MEAN I WAS LIKE HOT

14:08.548 --> 14:09.583
AND I WALKED IN HERE
FOR A SECOND.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.594
WHAT THE?

14:11.594 --> 14:12.121
WHAT THE?

14:12.154 --> 14:14.592
LOOK, THERE'S ONIONS GROWING
ON TOP OF ONIONS.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.261
BUT IT GETS WORSE,
UNFORTUNATELY.

14:16.295 --> 14:18.431
THE WHOLE THING IS
LEAKING HERE.

14:18.464 --> 14:20.034
WHAT THE
IS THAT?

14:20.067 --> 14:21.469
WHAT IS THAT?

14:21.503 --> 14:23.340
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU HAVE TO ASK THE CHEF.

14:23.373 --> 14:24.708
YOU CAN BECOME FAMOUS
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS

14:24.741 --> 14:27.146
FOR  POISONING
HALF OF BABYLON.

14:27.179 --> 14:28.949
YOU OUGHT TO BE
ASHAMED.

14:28.982 --> 14:33.256
THAT IS SOUR AND HAS TO BE
FOUR WEEKS OLD.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.561
JUST SMELL THAT FOR ME.
NO, NO, JUST SMELL IT.

14:36.594 --> 14:40.168
OKAY, JUST SMELL IT
THOUGH, TINA.

14:40.201 --> 14:41.594
- THIS IS A  NIGHTMARE.
- OH, THAT'S.

14:41.594 --> 14:41.971
- THIS IS A  NIGHTMARE.
- OH, THAT'S.

14:42.004 --> 14:43.373
DO WE REALLY
SERVE THAT?

14:43.406 --> 14:46.278
NO, BUT DOESN'T THIS
FALL UNDER THE CHEF'S JOB?

14:46.311 --> 14:48.047
WELL, WHERE ARE THE?

14:48.081 --> 14:49.650
THIS IS YOUR FRIDGE

14:49.683 --> 14:51.887
IN THE MIDDLE
OF YOUR  BUSINESS.

14:51.921 --> 14:53.256
CAN WE GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE I CATCH SOMETHING?
YEAH.

14:53.290 --> 14:54.792
I FEEL TERRIBLE

14:54.826 --> 14:56.161
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, TELL--
SOMEBODY TELLING YOU

14:56.195 --> 14:57.629
YOUR KID IS UGLY.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.736
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS HERE.
- WHAT THE?

15:00.769 --> 15:02.872
THE WALK-IN BOX IS A MESS.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:02.905 --> 15:05.075
THAT WALK-IN BOX WAS
EXACTLY HOW WE FELT

15:05.110 --> 15:07.013
ABOUT WORKING
IN THE KITCHEN.

15:07.046 --> 15:08.882
IT'S LIKE BLAME
EVERYTHING ON ME.

15:08.915 --> 15:11.594
THE BIG FIRES IN CHICAGO,
HURRICANE KATRINA, 9/11.

15:11.594 --> 15:12.856
THE BIG FIRES IN CHICAGO,
HURRICANE KATRINA, 9/11.

15:12.889 --> 15:14.258
WHAT THE?

15:14.291 --> 15:15.727
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER SEEN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

15:15.761 --> 15:17.096
STOP ACTING LIKE
A  BABY.

15:17.130 --> 15:19.233
I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A BABY,
JUST THROWING EVERYTHING ON ME.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.735
WELL,  STAND HERE.

15:20.769 --> 15:22.238
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M TAKING NUMBER ONE--ME!

15:22.271 --> 15:24.776
I WANT THE PLACE CLEAN,
END OF  STORY.

15:24.809 --> 15:26.879
GUYS, PLEASE CLEAN THE PLACE.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

15:26.912 --> 15:28.281
I'VE NEVER SEEN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

15:28.314 --> 15:30.251
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

15:30.284 --> 15:33.389
BEFORE GORDON INITIATES
ANY CHANGES,

15:33.423 --> 15:36.729
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE KITCHEN IS SPOTLESS.

15:36.762 --> 15:38.498
HOW WE DOING, LADIES?

15:38.532 --> 15:41.370
I BELIEVE PETER

15:41.403 --> 15:41.594
IS A CORE PROBLEM OF
THE RESTAURANT'S DYSFUNCTION.

15:41.594 --> 15:44.408
IS A CORE PROBLEM OF
THE RESTAURANT'S DYSFUNCTION.

15:44.442 --> 15:46.011
AND HE ISN'T CONCERNED MUCH

15:46.044 --> 15:47.447
ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE
BUT HIMSELF.

15:54.959 --> 15:58.098
THE KITCHEN IS NOW CLEANER
THAN IT HAS BEEN IN YEARS.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.767
AND GORDON CAN NOW FOCUS

15:59.800 --> 16:01.770
ON OBSERVING TONIGHT'S
DINNER SERVICE.

16:01.803 --> 16:04.074
AND RESERVATIONS,
WHAT HAVE WE GOT BOOKED?

16:04.108 --> 16:05.910
WE'RE REALLY--
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

16:05.944 --> 16:07.948
SOME, UH...

16:07.981 --> 16:08.982
THERE'S NOTHING
IN THERE.

16:11.520 --> 16:11.594
BUSINESS I-IS ROUGH.
IT'S HURTING.

16:11.594 --> 16:13.823
BUSINESS I-IS ROUGH.
IT'S HURTING.

16:13.857 --> 16:15.460
I MAY HAVE TO SELL
MY WATCH.

16:15.494 --> 16:16.929
YOU GOT $20?

16:16.963 --> 16:17.930
SO IT IS FAKE.

16:17.964 --> 16:19.968
FAKE.

16:20.001 --> 16:21.637
THE ONLY THING THAT'S FAKE
IS MY TEETH.

16:21.670 --> 16:22.939
THEY'RE  WHITE.

16:22.973 --> 16:24.074
THEY'RE WHITE.
THEY'RE BLEACHED.

16:24.107 --> 16:25.309
HOW MUCH DID THAT COST?

16:25.343 --> 16:27.312
I DON'T KNOW.
A THOUSAND A VISIT.

16:27.347 --> 16:30.719
I JUST BRUSH MINE
TWICE A DAY.

16:30.752 --> 16:32.221
HELL.

16:32.255 --> 16:35.093
BUT IT GOES WELL
WITH THE BROWN TAN.

16:35.126 --> 16:37.163
WELL, SOMEWHAT.
YEAH.

16:43.206 --> 16:44.608
IT'S BEEN SUCH A LONG TIME

16:44.642 --> 16:46.311
SINCE I HAD
GOOD EQUIPMENT HERE.

16:46.344 --> 16:47.813
IT'S BOTHERING ME, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

16:47.847 --> 16:48.849
IT'S NOT MY RESTAURANT.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.251
WHAT DOESN'T WORK?

16:50.285 --> 16:52.956
ALL THESE STOVE TOPS
HERE DON'T WORK.

16:52.989 --> 16:54.959
THE BROILER
DOESN'T WORK PROPER.

16:54.992 --> 16:56.828
THIS OVEN DOES NOT WORK.

16:56.862 --> 16:58.698
WE USE IT AS STORAGE.

16:58.732 --> 17:00.368
WE KEEP OUR TOWELS
AND STUFF IN HERE.

17:00.402 --> 17:02.038
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

17:02.071 --> 17:03.707
A NEW PIECE OF EQUIPMENT
WAS BOUGHT IN THIS KITCHEN?

17:05.810 --> 17:07.479
PETER IS A LOT MORE PROUD
OF HIS CAR

17:07.513 --> 17:08.748
THAN HE IS HIS
RESTAURANT.

17:09.917 --> 17:11.053
ABSOLUTELY.

17:11.086 --> 17:11.594
THAT KITCHEN IS

17:11.594 --> 17:12.388
THAT KITCHEN IS

17:12.422 --> 17:13.256
THE HEART
OF THE RESTAURANT.

17:13.289 --> 17:14.658
WHEN THAT'S HURT,

17:14.692 --> 17:16.161
IT'S LIKE A CLOGGED
ARTERY.

17:16.194 --> 17:18.030
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A BIG PROBLEM.

17:18.064 --> 17:21.069
WITH MOST OF THE KITCHEN
EQUIPMENT NOT FUNCTIONING,

17:21.102 --> 17:22.605
IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE

17:22.639 --> 17:24.609
FOR THE CHEFS
TO DO THEIR JOBS.

17:24.642 --> 17:27.780
AND THEIR FRUSTRATION IS BEING
FELT BY THE ENTIRE STAFF.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.050
WHERE'S MY PORTOFINO?

17:30.084 --> 17:32.221
IT'S COMING.
DON'T KEEP ASKING FOR 'EM.

17:32.255 --> 17:33.724
DON'T ASK FOR THEM
ONE MORE  TIME.

17:33.757 --> 17:35.293
WHEN THERE'S
A CHAOTIC NIGHT HERE,

17:35.326 --> 17:37.162
I HAVE ROBERT SCREAMING.

17:37.196 --> 17:38.832
WHEN THE PIECES ARE READY,

17:38.865 --> 17:40.534
THAT'S WHEN
THEY'RE GONNA COME OUT.

17:40.569 --> 17:41.594
HE'S AN EXCELLENT CHEF,
BUT HE'S CRAZY.

17:41.594 --> 17:42.138
HE'S AN EXCELLENT CHEF,
BUT HE'S CRAZY.

17:42.171 --> 17:43.406
TAKE THE--TAKE THE SALAD.

17:43.439 --> 17:44.608
GOTTA KEEP ASKING

17:44.642 --> 17:46.979
FOR THE  FOOD.

17:47.013 --> 17:48.749
CAN YOU SEE
IF MY FRIEND THE DOCTOR

17:48.782 --> 17:50.118
WANTS ANOTHER BOTTLE
OF WINE ON A--

17:50.151 --> 17:51.287
SURE.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.656
YEAH.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.995
WHO'S GOT C5?
ME.

18:02.271 --> 18:04.174
IS THE DOCTOR
COMPED TONIGHT?

18:04.207 --> 18:06.245
THE DOCTOR'S COMPED.

18:06.278 --> 18:07.881
DO YOU TAKE CARE OF IT
PERSONALLY?

18:07.914 --> 18:09.216
OR JUST PUT IT ON
THE BUSINESS?

18:09.250 --> 18:10.952
IT GOES OFF THE TOP.
IT'S AN EXPENSE.

18:10.986 --> 18:11.594
HOW CAN I NOT?

18:11.594 --> 18:12.455
HOW CAN I NOT?

18:12.488 --> 18:15.694
I MEAN, THE GUY, YOU KNOW--
THE GUY TAKES CARE OF ME.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.330
IT'S ONLY BUSINESS.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.565
I THINK THEY SAID THAT
INTHE GODFATHER.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.201
I  CHARGE
MY DOCTOR.

18:20.234 --> 18:21.403
TRUST ME,
HE EARNS ENOUGH.

18:21.437 --> 18:22.605
YEAH.

18:22.639 --> 18:24.308
IT'S LIKE A LITTLE
MEETING PLACE HERE.

18:24.342 --> 18:26.278
YEAH, A LITTLE
MEETING PLACE, YEAH.

18:26.311 --> 18:28.114
THE COMBINATION OF PETER

18:28.147 --> 18:29.951
SPENDING A GREAT DEAL
OF MONEY ON HIMSELF,

18:29.984 --> 18:31.787
AND GIVING AWAY FREE MEALS,

18:31.821 --> 18:35.626
HAS PUT THE FAMILY BUSINESS
IN JEOPARDY.

18:35.660 --> 18:39.333
NOW A BILL COLLECTOR
MAKES AN UNEXPECTED VISIT.

18:39.367 --> 18:41.594
AND PETER'S IRRESPONSIBILITY
COMES BACK TO HAUNT HIM.

18:41.594 --> 18:43.674
AND PETER'S IRRESPONSIBILITY
COMES BACK TO HAUNT HIM.

18:45.510 --> 18:47.246
NO, NOT RIGHT NOW
I DON'T, BUDDY, NO.

18:47.279 --> 18:48.749
NO, NOT RIGHT
NOW I DON'T.

18:48.782 --> 18:49.517
WELL, AS SOON
AS YOU GOT A MINUTE.

18:49.550 --> 18:50.818
YEAH, OKAY.

18:50.853 --> 18:52.221
AS SOON AS YOU GOT A MINUTE,
TELEPHONE, TOUGH GUY.

18:52.254 --> 18:53.189
GO  YOURSELF.

18:53.223 --> 18:55.560
GET THE
OUT OF HERE!

18:55.594 --> 18:57.296
TAKE YOUR
HANDS OFF, JOHN.

18:57.330 --> 18:58.932
TAKE YOUR
HANDS OFF.

18:58.966 --> 18:59.834
YOU WANT TO HIT ME?
YOU WANT TO HIT ME?

18:59.868 --> 19:01.102
YOU'RE THE TOUGH GUY.

19:01.136 --> 19:02.238
PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME,
PETE.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.273
I'LL LET YOU
DO IT FIRST.

19:03.306 --> 19:04.509
LISTEN TO ME,
TOUGH GUY.

19:04.542 --> 19:06.912
OUR FRIENDSHIP
IS  OVER.

19:06.945 --> 19:08.515
YOU AIN'T MY FRIEND.
YOU'RE A SCUMBAG.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.817
YOU'RE A LOWLIFE.

19:09.850 --> 19:11.353
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A SCUMBAG.

19:11.386 --> 19:11.594
YOU  TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT AGAIN,

19:11.594 --> 19:12.422
YOU  TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT AGAIN,

19:12.455 --> 19:13.557
YOU'LL GET HURT.

19:13.590 --> 19:14.993
YOU'LL GET
HURT.

19:15.026 --> 19:16.227
YOU AIN'T GOT ME SCARED.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

19:16.262 --> 19:18.098
YOU AIN'T GOT ME
SCARED, BO.

19:18.131 --> 19:19.667
DON'T
WALK UP ON ME.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.637
I'LL  HURT YOU,
YOU LITTLE.

19:21.670 --> 19:23.808
NO, WAIT!

19:28.916 --> 19:30.819
YOU WANT TO HIT ME?
YOU WANT TO HIT ME?

19:30.852 --> 19:32.254
PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME,
PETE.

19:32.288 --> 19:33.256
I'LL LET YOU
DO IT FIRST.

19:33.290 --> 19:34.926
LISTEN TO ME, TOUGH GUY.

19:34.959 --> 19:36.795
YOU  TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT AGAIN YOU GET HURT.

19:36.829 --> 19:37.764
YOU'LL GET
HURT.

19:37.797 --> 19:39.500
DON'T
WALK UP ON ME.

19:39.533 --> 19:42.004
I'LL  HURT YOU,
YOU LITTLE.

19:42.038 --> 19:43.474
GET THE
OUT OF HERE.

19:43.507 --> 19:44.742
OKAY, MAYBE
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

19:44.776 --> 19:45.877
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.313
NO.

19:47.346 --> 19:49.015
I SPOKE TO OTHER PEOPLE TOO
THAT HE'S IN DEBT WITH.

19:49.049 --> 19:50.819
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

19:50.853 --> 19:52.489
I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO HIM.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.634
AFTER PETER'S BRUSH

19:59.667 --> 20:01.837
WITH AN OVERZEALOUS
BILL COLLECTOR,

20:01.871 --> 20:03.640
GORDON CHECKS IN
WITH HIS SISTER,

20:03.673 --> 20:05.243
AND RESTAURANT OWNER,
TINA.

20:05.276 --> 20:06.278
I KNOW I'VE JUST ARRIVED,

20:06.311 --> 20:08.749
BUT  ME.

20:08.782 --> 20:10.085
HOW DO YOU MANAGE?

20:10.118 --> 20:11.721
I'M MOTIVATED
BY ALL THE NICE PEOPLE

20:11.754 --> 20:13.357
THAT COME IN
TO VISIT ME.
UH-HUH.

20:13.390 --> 20:15.093
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
I'M HAVING A BREAKDOWN.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.595
TELL ME
YOUR BIGGEST FRUSTRATION.

20:16.629 --> 20:17.998
WHAT'S THE ONE BIG ISSUE
THAT YOU HAVE?

20:18.031 --> 20:20.167
FROM THE KITCHEN
TO MY BROTHER,

20:20.201 --> 20:22.205
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
IT'S LIKE A FREE-FOR-ALL.

20:22.238 --> 20:23.941
LIKE EVERYONE'S JUST DOING
WHAT THEY WANT.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.665
I GET SO EXASPERATED
SOMETIMES,

20:25.665 --> 20:25.944
I GET SO EXASPERATED
SOMETIMES,

20:25.977 --> 20:28.682
SO STRESSED OUT
THAT I WANT TO CRY

20:28.715 --> 20:30.318
OR COMMIT BLOODY MURDER.

20:30.351 --> 20:32.756
BUT DOES PETER PLAY
A PART IN THE FINANCIAL SIDE?

20:32.789 --> 20:34.625
HE'LL TAKE HIS PAYCHECK
BUT NOT COME IN.

20:34.659 --> 20:36.795
I COME IN
AND THEY'LL TELL ME,

20:36.828 --> 20:39.400
"OH, PETER TOOK $200."

20:41.437 --> 20:43.974
IT'S LIKE I DIDN'T EVEN

20:44.007 --> 20:45.343
BREAK EVEN
FOR THE DAY,

20:45.376 --> 20:46.378
AND HE TOOK MONEY.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.617
HE CAN'T DO THAT.

20:49.650 --> 20:51.653
HOW LONG CAN YOU CONTINUE
FUNCTION LIKE THIS WITH--

20:51.687 --> 20:53.256
NOT MUCH LONGER.

20:53.289 --> 20:55.026
AND I CAN'T--I CAN'T
DO IT EITHER.

20:55.060 --> 20:55.665
I WOULD SOONER
SELL THE BUSINESS.

20:55.665 --> 20:56.562
I WOULD SOONER
SELL THE BUSINESS.

20:56.596 --> 20:57.898
I'M NOT A MARTYR.

20:57.931 --> 20:59.467
I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING IT
ON MY OWN.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.070
AND THAT'S THE PART
ABOUT IT I RESENT.

21:01.103 --> 21:02.171
IT'S NOT FAIR.

21:02.204 --> 21:04.809
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,

21:04.842 --> 21:06.980
WHAT'S AT STAKE IN TERMS
OF, YOU KNOW,

21:07.013 --> 21:08.181
HOW MUCH WOULD YOU LOSE.

21:08.214 --> 21:10.952
MY HOUSE.
YOUR HOUSE.

21:10.986 --> 21:12.588
THIS IS CRAZY,
BECAUSE THE TRUE DEFINITION

21:12.622 --> 21:13.790
OF A FAMILY BUSINESS

21:13.824 --> 21:15.526
IS EVERY MEMBER
OF THAT FAMILY

21:15.560 --> 21:17.897
WORKING WITHIN
TO MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL.
MM-HMM.

21:17.931 --> 21:21.403
NOT ONE PERSON
CARRYING THE BURDEN.

21:21.436 --> 21:22.972
I KNOW.

21:30.318 --> 21:32.087
IT'S DAY THREE,

21:32.121 --> 21:34.025
AND A PERFECT TIME
FOR GORDON

21:34.058 --> 21:36.528
TO GIVE THE FAMILY
A MUCH-NEEDED WAKE-UP CALL.

21:36.561 --> 21:38.265
THIS BUSINESS WAS SET UP

21:38.298 --> 21:39.768
17 YEARS AGO
AS A FAMILY BUSINESS, YES?

21:39.801 --> 21:41.202
YES.

21:41.237 --> 21:43.340
TODAY, WE'RE GONNA
RENEW THAT COMMITMENT.

21:43.373 --> 21:46.812
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT
MORE FAMILY THAN EVER BEFORE.

21:46.845 --> 21:48.214
THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

21:48.248 --> 21:49.717
YOU, YEAH,
WITH YOUR FATHER,

21:49.750 --> 21:51.653
ARE GONNA GO AND RUN
THE KITCHEN.

21:51.687 --> 21:53.089
YOU'RE GONNA COOK.

21:54.358 --> 21:55.665
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA RUN
THE KITCHEN.

21:55.665 --> 21:56.061
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA RUN
THE KITCHEN.

21:56.094 --> 21:57.329
OH, I LOVE IT!

21:57.363 --> 21:58.532
OH, MY GOD!

21:58.565 --> 22:00.936
OY, VEY.

22:00.969 --> 22:02.739
I WANT YOU TO GO
AND WORK IN THAT KITCHEN,

22:02.772 --> 22:04.341
AND JUST EXPERIENCE
WHAT IT'S LIKE

22:04.375 --> 22:06.311
BEHIND THAT LINE,
AND WORK WITH YOUR DAD.

22:06.344 --> 22:07.580
YOU LIKE FOOD.

22:07.613 --> 22:09.718
YOU CERTAINLY EAT ENOUGH
OF IT HERE.

22:09.751 --> 22:11.520
TINA, YOU'RE GONNA RUN
THE DINING ROOM WITH YOUR MOM.

22:11.554 --> 22:13.156
OKAY, GET IN THE KITCHEN,

22:13.190 --> 22:14.792
AND GET FAMILIAR
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.498
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
BOIL AN EGG.

22:18.531 --> 22:20.102
LOOK AT ME.
I'M SHAKING.
I'M LOOKING.

22:20.135 --> 22:21.604
FIND IT.
I'M  SHAKING.

22:21.637 --> 22:22.905
YOU'RE NOT SHAKING ENOUGH.
LET'S GO.

22:22.939 --> 22:24.174
COME ON, HUH?

22:24.208 --> 22:25.443
PETER'S LIKE
ONE OF THOSE GUYS,

22:25.477 --> 22:25.665
HE EATS OUT A LOT.

22:25.665 --> 22:26.312
HE EATS OUT A LOT.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.581
SO HE ASSUMES HE KNOWS

22:27.614 --> 22:29.484
ABOUT COOKING
IN RESTAURANTS.

22:29.517 --> 22:31.019
HE HAS NO CLUE
ABOUT THE KITCHEN.

22:31.053 --> 22:32.789
HELLO, WELCOME.

22:32.822 --> 22:34.558
WHILE PETER AND HIS FATHER

22:34.592 --> 22:35.961
ARE SETTLING
INTO THE KITCHEN...

22:35.994 --> 22:37.864
WHY IS IT THIS BURNER
DON'T GO LOWER?

22:37.897 --> 22:39.333
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

22:39.366 --> 22:41.137
GORDON IS PACKING
THE DINING ROOM

22:41.170 --> 22:42.404
WITH CUSTOMERS.

22:42.438 --> 22:44.108
FIRST ORDER'S COMING IN.
STAND BY.

22:44.142 --> 22:45.711
CAN I START WITH YOU?
YEAH, SURE.

22:45.744 --> 22:47.580
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?
THE SALMON.

22:47.614 --> 22:50.585
MA, DO ME A FAVOR.
MAKE ME AN ESPRESSO, PLEASE.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.255
GO MAKE IT YOURSELF.

22:52.288 --> 22:53.490
I JUST WANTED MY MOTHER

22:53.524 --> 22:54.793
TO GET ME AN ESPRESSO.

22:54.826 --> 22:55.665
ESPRESSO?
BLOODY HELL?

22:55.665 --> 22:57.163
ESPRESSO?
BLOODY HELL?

22:57.196 --> 22:58.265
IS HE ALWAYS LIKE THIS?

22:58.298 --> 22:59.400
YEAH.

22:59.433 --> 23:00.936
IS HE?
MY GOD.

23:00.969 --> 23:03.072
IF MY DAD AND MY BROTHER
WERE THE CHEFS,

23:03.106 --> 23:05.377
I THINK THERE'D BE
A MASS MURDER IN HERE.

23:05.410 --> 23:06.779
I HAVE AN ORDER.

23:06.813 --> 23:09.349
ALL ABOARD!

23:09.383 --> 23:10.752
THE FIRST ORDER'S IN.

23:10.785 --> 23:12.489
I NEED BLACK OLIVES
AND ARTICHOKES.

23:12.522 --> 23:13.723
RIGHT UNDERNEATH HERE.

23:13.757 --> 23:16.061
COULD SOMEONE SET US UP?

23:16.094 --> 23:17.764
HOLD ON, NOW IT'S THEM THAT
DIDN'T SET YOU UP PROPERLY.

23:17.797 --> 23:18.933
I LIKE THAT.

23:18.966 --> 23:20.168
I'M HAVING
A MELTDOWN HERE.

23:20.202 --> 23:21.102
ARE WE READY TO ORDER?

23:21.136 --> 23:22.638
DO YOU NEED A FEW MINUTES?

23:22.672 --> 23:24.375
CAN I HAVE A
WORKING OVEN?

23:24.409 --> 23:25.665
THOSE ARE THE ONES
THAT I ORDERED ALREADY.

23:25.665 --> 23:26.111
THOSE ARE THE ONES
THAT I ORDERED ALREADY.

23:26.145 --> 23:27.346
THAT CLAMS AND THE SOUP.

23:27.380 --> 23:30.886

23:30.919 --> 23:32.989
THIS IS
A CLUSTER  BACK HERE.

23:33.022 --> 23:34.658
ANGELA, TABLE SEVEN,
PLEASE, MY DARLING.

23:36.228 --> 23:38.065
WHERE ARE THE CLAMS?
WHERE'S THE SALMON?

23:38.098 --> 23:39.400
WHERE'S MY LEMONS?

23:39.434 --> 23:41.070
YOU'RE SHOUTING FOR LEMONS,
AND LOOK.

23:41.103 --> 23:42.772
THERE'S A
BOX OF LEMONS HERE.

23:42.806 --> 23:44.041
I NEED CLEAN SPOONS.
I NEED CLEAN SPOONS.

23:44.075 --> 23:46.445
I NEED CHICKEN.
I NEED CHICKEN.

23:46.478 --> 23:47.580
WHAT'S THAT IN FRONT
OF YOUR EYES?

23:47.614 --> 23:49.885
OH, OKAY.

23:49.918 --> 23:51.687
PETER IS...

23:51.721 --> 23:54.024
HE'S A 250-POUND SPOILED BABY.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.460
HOLY.

23:58.265 --> 24:00.769
TELL 'EM
I'LL BUY 'EM DESERT.

24:00.802 --> 24:02.138
NO, YOU HAVE
TO GET THEM OUT.

24:02.171 --> 24:03.574
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

24:03.607 --> 24:05.577
I CAN DO WHAT I CAN DO
AT THE MOMENT.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.748
OKAY, THAT'S PUT THE CAT
AMONGST THE PIGEONS.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.684
PETER'S NOW GETTING A TASTE
OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

24:09.717 --> 24:11.520
HE'S NOW SEEING
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

24:11.553 --> 24:13.256
TO COOK IN THAT KITCHEN
WITH NOTHING THAT WORKS.

24:13.290 --> 24:14.926
SO THIS IS EMBARRASSING,

24:14.959 --> 24:16.628
BECAUSE THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN
A FAMILY,

24:16.662 --> 24:17.964
CLOSE-KNIT TYPE,
RUN RESTAURANT.

24:17.997 --> 24:20.936
IT'S AN HOUR INTO LUNCH,

24:20.969 --> 24:23.173
AND THERE'S STILL NO FOOD
COMING OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

24:23.206 --> 24:25.243
IT'S DONE.
WHAT'S BURNING IN HERE?

24:25.276 --> 24:25.665
HE JUST BURNT THE CHICKEN.

24:25.665 --> 24:26.578
HE JUST BURNT THE CHICKEN.

24:26.612 --> 24:28.114
WHERE ARE THE
WEEDS?

24:28.148 --> 24:29.417
WE JUST COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

24:29.450 --> 24:30.218
I DON'T KNOW,
I'M LOOKING FOR A CORNER

24:30.252 --> 24:31.153
TO HIDE SOMEWHERE.

24:31.186 --> 24:32.422
CAN SOMEONE GET ME
TINA, PLEASE.

24:32.455 --> 24:34.325
I NEED ORANGE JUICE.

24:34.358 --> 24:35.794
YOU WANT TINA
TO STOP NOW

24:35.827 --> 24:37.296
AND GET YOU A GLASS
OF ORANGE JUICE?

24:37.330 --> 24:38.265
NO, BUT DO I HAVE ANYBODY
THAT CAN HELP ME?

24:38.298 --> 24:39.032
CAN YOU GET ME
AN ORANGE JUICE?

24:39.066 --> 24:40.335
GO  YOURSELF.

24:40.368 --> 24:43.106
WHAT?
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

24:43.139 --> 24:44.308
OOH!

24:47.547 --> 24:49.416
YEAH.

24:49.450 --> 24:50.952
I WANT TO SEE
WHAT BIG BOY'S MADE OF.

24:50.986 --> 24:52.555
COME ON.

24:52.589 --> 24:55.026
LET'S GO, YEAH?
YEAH.

24:55.059 --> 24:55.665
LET'S GO, BIG BOY.

24:55.665 --> 24:57.230
LET'S GO, BIG BOY.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.934
FINALLY SOMEONE TOLD HIM,
"LISTEN, BUDDY.

24:59.967 --> 25:02.405
"DON'T ACT LIKE
YOU'RE THE KING OVER HERE,

25:02.438 --> 25:04.008
BECAUSE YOU GOT NOTHING."

25:04.041 --> 25:06.045
YOU GET THE
OUT OF HERE, OUT.

25:06.078 --> 25:07.748
ROBERT,
BACK ON THERE PLEASE.

25:07.781 --> 25:08.715
YEAH, LET'S GO.
THANK YOU, GOD!

25:08.749 --> 25:10.284
UNBELIEVABLE.

25:10.318 --> 25:12.122
NOW THAT GORDON
HAS PROVED HIS POINT

25:12.155 --> 25:13.557
ABOUT THE INADEQUATE KITCHEN,

25:13.591 --> 25:17.130
HE REALIZES HE HAS TO DO
SOMETHING QUICKLY.

25:17.163 --> 25:19.501
FOR THE RESTAURANT TO BE
READY FOR RE-LAUNCH.

25:19.534 --> 25:23.240
GORDON DID, YOU KNOW,
ATTACK PETER IN THE RIGHT WAY,

25:23.273 --> 25:25.209
BECAUSE HE SAW HIM
AS BEING, YOU KNOW,

25:25.243 --> 25:25.665
A BIG SHOT, A GUY TRYING
TO ACT LIKE A BIG SHOT.

25:25.665 --> 25:27.480
A BIG SHOT, A GUY TRYING
TO ACT LIKE A BIG SHOT.

25:27.514 --> 25:29.450
WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
WILL YOU GO OUT?

25:29.483 --> 25:30.919
GO GET SOME FRESH AIR OR--

25:30.952 --> 25:32.588
MIGHT AS WELL GET
A  MANICURE.

25:32.622 --> 25:33.090
POLISH YOUR WHEELS
OR DO SOMETHING.

25:42.338 --> 25:43.941
IT'S DAY FOUR.

25:43.974 --> 25:45.343
AND ALTHOUGH
PETER'S WORK ETHIC

25:45.377 --> 25:46.679
HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTMENT,

25:46.712 --> 25:48.515
GORDON STILL DECIDES
TO INTRODUCE

25:48.549 --> 25:50.618
THE FIRST PHASE
OF HIS TRANSFORMATION PLAN.

25:50.652 --> 25:53.690
RIGHT, TODAY IS
A NEW BEGINNING.

25:53.723 --> 25:55.527
A NEW CHAPTER
FOR PETER'S RESTAURANT, YES?

25:55.561 --> 25:57.330
YES.

25:57.363 --> 25:58.833
THE ONE THING THAT REALLY
NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE HERE

25:58.866 --> 26:00.702
IS COMMITMENT.

26:00.735 --> 26:02.538
WE'RE GONNA
IMPLEMENT CHANGES.

26:02.572 --> 26:06.479
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE, YEAH?
THROUGH TO THE KITCHEN.

26:06.512 --> 26:07.803
WELCOME TO YOUR NEW KITCHEN.

26:07.803 --> 26:09.851
WELCOME TO YOUR NEW KITCHEN.

26:09.884 --> 26:11.019
OH, MY GOD!
AAH!

26:11.053 --> 26:14.425
- OH, MAN!
- HOLY , BRO!

26:14.458 --> 26:16.762
HAVE A LOOK, HAVE A LOOK,
HAVE A LOOK.

26:16.796 --> 26:18.632
GORDON BROUGHT IN THE FINEST
KITCHEN SPECIALISTS,

26:18.665 --> 26:21.036
WHO WORKED OVERNIGHT
TO GIVE THIS RESTAURANT

26:21.070 --> 26:23.875
SOMETHING IT SORELY NEEDED--
A PROPER KITCHEN.

26:23.908 --> 26:25.544
EVERY OVEN IS WORKING.

26:25.577 --> 26:27.780
OH, MY GOD!

26:27.814 --> 26:30.585
OH, PETER, LOOK AT THIS!

26:30.619 --> 26:34.592
PLATES, STOVES,
OVENS, MATS.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.595
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

26:36.629 --> 26:37.803
A NEW DOUBLE FRIDGE
AS WELL.

26:37.803 --> 26:38.665
A NEW DOUBLE FRIDGE
AS WELL.

26:38.699 --> 26:40.903
OH, MY GOD.

26:40.936 --> 26:42.772
THAT'S A PROPER WORKING
FRIDGE, YES?

26:42.805 --> 26:44.776
WHAT A KITCHEN.

26:44.809 --> 26:47.046
I THINK WE WERE ALL STARTING
TO LOSE STEAM HERE

26:47.079 --> 26:48.749
AND GIVE UP.

26:48.782 --> 26:51.687
AND HE BROUGHT US BACK
TO A SUNNY DAY.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.891
YOUR NEW KINGDOM.

26:53.925 --> 26:55.761
THIS IS REALLY A GOOD THING.

26:55.794 --> 26:57.830
NOW I CAN REALLY HAVE
A REAL KITCHEN

26:57.864 --> 26:59.868
WHERE I CAN ACTUALLY COOK
THINGS THE RIGHT WAY.

26:59.901 --> 27:02.471
I'VE INVESTED IN THIS.
NOW I WANT TO SEE YOU.

27:02.505 --> 27:04.943
WITH OPPORTUNITY
COMES RESPONSIBILITY.

27:04.976 --> 27:06.979
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT GORDON
WAS TRYING TO POINT OUT.

27:07.012 --> 27:07.803
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:07.803 --> 27:08.248
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:08.281 --> 27:10.051
"I'VE GIVEN YOU
WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.

27:10.084 --> 27:11.486
NOW YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
TO USE IT RESPECTFULLY."

27:16.596 --> 27:18.298
TIME FOR THE CHEFS AND GORDON

27:18.332 --> 27:20.134
TO PUT THE NEW KITCHEN
TO USE

27:20.168 --> 27:22.072
AS GORDON BEGINS
TO CHANGE THE MENU.

27:22.105 --> 27:23.440
THERE WE GO.

27:23.473 --> 27:24.809
I WANT TO FOCUS

27:24.842 --> 27:26.913
ON FAMILY STYLE DINING.

27:26.946 --> 27:29.183
WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING
SIMPLE, STUNNING,

27:29.216 --> 27:31.220
CLASSIC ITALIAN FOOD.

27:31.254 --> 27:33.457
OKAY, LASAGNA.

27:33.490 --> 27:35.761
VERY EXCITED TONIGHT
TO COOK WITH GORDON.

27:35.794 --> 27:37.803
DEFINITELY AN HONOR
TO COOK WITH SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

27:37.803 --> 27:37.864
DEFINITELY AN HONOR
TO COOK WITH SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

27:37.897 --> 27:40.769
I FELL INTO A BIT
OF A RUT CULINARILY.

27:40.802 --> 27:43.140
AND NOW THAT GORDON'S GIVEN ME
THIS NEW MENU TO WORK WITH,

27:43.173 --> 27:45.477
IT'S A REVITALIZING
KIND OF FEELING, YOU KNOW?

27:45.510 --> 27:46.579
LET'S GO.

27:46.612 --> 27:48.248
GORDON INTRODUCES

27:48.282 --> 27:50.653
A NEW FAMILY STYLE MENU
THAT WILL SEPARATE

27:50.686 --> 27:52.656
PETER'S RESTAURANT
FROM THE COMPETITION.

27:52.689 --> 27:55.160
THERE'S WHAT, SIX, SEVEN,
ITALIAN RESTAURANTS

27:55.193 --> 27:56.929
OUT THERE IN BABYLON.

27:56.963 --> 28:00.635
ONE THING THAT CAN SEPARATE
THIS RESTAURANT FROM THE OTHERS

28:00.669 --> 28:03.540
IS RUNNING LIKE THIS LIKE
A TRUE FAMILY RESTAURANT.

28:03.573 --> 28:07.180
GORDON CAME ABOUT
THE IDEA OF FAMILY STYLE,

28:07.213 --> 28:07.803
WHICH I THINK
IS AN EXCEPTIONAL IDEA.

28:07.803 --> 28:09.885
WHICH I THINK
IS AN EXCEPTIONAL IDEA.

28:09.918 --> 28:11.954
WE NEEDED SOMETHING
TO HELP US STAND OUT.

28:11.988 --> 28:14.392
FOR TONIGHT'S DINNER SERVICE,

28:14.426 --> 28:17.597
THE PARSLEY COVERED RAVIOLI
AND THE COLD CRAB CAKES

28:17.631 --> 28:20.068
HAVE BEEN REPLACED
BY FRESH, HOME MADE

28:20.101 --> 28:21.570
FAMILY STYLE DISHES,
SUCH AS...

28:21.603 --> 28:23.607
LOBSTER RAVIOLI.

28:23.641 --> 28:24.675
THE PENNE LASAGNA.

28:24.709 --> 28:25.811
GRILLED FLANK STEAK.

28:25.844 --> 28:27.413
CAPELLINI AND ROCCHETTA.

28:27.447 --> 28:29.651
AND THEN PORCHETTA,
WHICH IS BEAUTIFUL.

28:29.684 --> 28:31.587
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE DISHES
THAT ARE POPULAR.

28:31.620 --> 28:33.724
THIS IS NOW A TIME
FOR YOU TO SORT OF

28:33.757 --> 28:36.261
REALLY SERIOUSLY START GETTING
THAT MESSAGE OUT THERE.

28:36.295 --> 28:37.803
IT'S SO SIMPLE.

28:37.803 --> 28:37.964
IT'S SO SIMPLE.

28:37.997 --> 28:43.207
OKAY, GUYS, I'VE GOT
A BIG, BIG, BIG LAUNCH.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.609
BIG HULLABALOO.
YEAH, BIG TIME.

28:44.642 --> 28:46.479
GOOD COME.

28:46.512 --> 28:48.281

28:48.315 --> 28:49.851
WITH A BRAND-NEW KITCHEN,

28:49.884 --> 28:51.487
A REDESIGNED MENU,

28:51.520 --> 28:55.527
AND A NEW STRATEGY THAT
REACHES OUT TO FAMILIES,

28:55.560 --> 28:57.563
THE RESTAURANT IS READY
TO ATTEMPT IT'S BIG RE-LAUNCH.

28:57.597 --> 28:59.234
LET'S DO IT.

29:03.140 --> 29:05.778
WITH THE DOORS ABOUT TO OPEN,

29:05.811 --> 29:07.803
GORDON GATHERS THE STAFF
FOR A QUICK CHAT.

29:07.803 --> 29:08.047
GORDON GATHERS THE STAFF
FOR A QUICK CHAT.

29:08.081 --> 29:09.718
OKAY.

29:09.751 --> 29:12.923
TONIGHT IS A CRITICAL,
CRUCIAL NIGHT.

29:14.459 --> 29:16.362
ARE YOU WITH US
OR YOU--

29:16.395 --> 29:19.667
OKAY, WELL, WE'RE RIGHT
REALLY BUSY RIGHT NOW.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.105
ONCE AGAIN, PETER'S HAS

29:22.138 --> 29:23.774
A BILL COLLECTOR
ON ITS DOORSTEP.

29:23.808 --> 29:26.946
WELL, YOU ARE INTERFERING.
GO AWAY.

29:30.418 --> 29:31.954
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

29:31.987 --> 29:35.327
WHY DON'T YOU GO AWAY

29:35.360 --> 29:37.803
WHY DON'T YOU GO--
NO, GET OUT OF THE WAY.

29:37.803 --> 29:38.933
WHY DON'T YOU GO--

29:38.966 --> 29:43.707

30:55.193 --> 31:00.001
GO AHEAD TOUGH GUY.
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW!

31:07.719 --> 31:09.680
YOU WANT TO FIGHT ME?

31:09.680 --> 31:11.019
COME ON, I'LL PUT YOU
IN THE HOSPITAL!

31:11.019 --> 31:12.621
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW!

31:12.655 --> 31:14.524
HEY, COFFEE BOY,
TAKE IT EASY.

31:14.558 --> 31:16.862
COME IN, COME IN,
COME IN, COME IN, COME IN.

31:16.895 --> 31:19.066
I'M SENDING FIVE GUYS
TO HIS HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

31:19.099 --> 31:19.967
JEREMY AND GUYS ARE
ON THEIR WAY RIGHT NOW.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.903
WHO THE  IS HE?!

31:21.937 --> 31:24.741
GIVE ME THIS MALLET.
I'M GONNA--

31:24.775 --> 31:27.680
THAT'S THE LAST
THAT'S COMING IN THIS PLACE.

31:29.182 --> 31:30.585
DID YOU SEE MY FATHER
ON THE FLOOR?!

31:30.618 --> 31:31.820
I KNOW!

31:31.854 --> 31:32.861
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I GET HOTHEADED?

31:32.861 --> 31:33.223
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I GET HOTHEADED?

31:33.256 --> 31:34.091
I'M SAYING RELAX.

31:34.124 --> 31:36.862
CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN,
CALM DOWN, EH?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.866
I TOLD HIM TO GET OUT.
ARE YOU OKAY?

31:38.899 --> 31:40.335
THEY FIGHT A LOT.

31:40.368 --> 31:42.505
YOU KNOW,
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

31:42.538 --> 31:44.642
RELAX, RELAX, RELAX, RELAX.

31:44.675 --> 31:46.879
LET'S GO OUTSIDE
FOR TWO SECONDS, WALK.

31:46.912 --> 31:50.417
FRESH AIR, COME ON,
WITH ME, LET'S GO.

32:02.337 --> 32:02.861
BIG DEEP BREATH, YEAH?

32:02.861 --> 32:05.075
BIG DEEP BREATH, YEAH?

32:05.109 --> 32:07.280
I'M HERE TO HELP.

32:07.313 --> 32:10.084
AFTER USING UP
CRUCIAL PREPARATION TIME

32:10.118 --> 32:11.787
FOR EVERYONE TO COOL OFF,

32:11.820 --> 32:14.725
GORDON NEEDS TO GET PETER
AND THE STAFF FOCUSED

32:14.759 --> 32:16.628
FOR TONIGHT'S RE-LAUNCH.

32:16.662 --> 32:18.899
BIG, BIG, BIG NIGHT.
I MEAN SERIOUSLY BIG NIGHT.

32:18.933 --> 32:21.202
NEW MENU,
NEW FAMILY STYLE DINING.

32:21.236 --> 32:22.872
NEW ATTITUDE.

32:22.905 --> 32:25.143
THIS COULD BE
THE BIG TURNING POINT

32:25.176 --> 32:26.545
FOR THIS RESTAURANT.

32:26.579 --> 32:29.550
USE THIS OPPORTUNITY
TO SHOW OFF

32:29.584 --> 32:32.522
HOW GOOD WE CAN BE.

32:32.555 --> 32:32.861
GOOD LUCK.

32:32.861 --> 32:35.627
GOOD LUCK.

32:35.660 --> 32:38.064
THERE IS EXCITEMENT
IN THE RESTAURANT

32:38.097 --> 32:39.901
ABOUT THE NEW MENU.

32:39.934 --> 32:41.269
DO THE FISH.
IT'S EXCELLENT.

32:41.303 --> 32:42.638
CLAMS, THE SINGLE.

32:42.671 --> 32:44.107
I LIKE THE IDEA
OF FAMILY STYLE.

32:44.140 --> 32:45.978
BUT BACK IN THE KITCHEN,

32:46.011 --> 32:47.981
IT'S UP TO THE CHEFS
TO EXECUTE.

32:48.014 --> 32:49.850
THE BIG TABLES ARE
ALL ORDERING FAMILY STYLE.

32:49.883 --> 32:51.419
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
WE'RE WORKING WITH

32:51.453 --> 32:53.490
ALL THIS NEW STUFF.

32:53.523 --> 32:54.691
IT'S LIKE ALIEN.

32:54.726 --> 32:55.960
MAY I HAVE
A CRANBERRY JUICE,

32:55.994 --> 32:58.832
SELTZER AND CRANBERRY.

32:58.865 --> 33:01.436
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
DO YOU HAVE PINEAPPLE JUICE?

33:01.470 --> 33:02.861
YEAH.
GIVE ME PINEAPPLE JUICE
WITH A LOT OF ICE

33:02.861 --> 33:03.306
YEAH.
GIVE ME PINEAPPLE JUICE
WITH A LOT OF ICE

33:03.339 --> 33:04.708
AND A SPLASH
OF CRANBERRY.

33:04.742 --> 33:07.079
IT'S GOOD FOR MY SUGAR.

33:07.113 --> 33:09.717
IT'S AN HOUR
INTO DINNER SERVICE,

33:09.751 --> 33:11.220
AND THE RESTAURANT
HAS NOT BEEN THIS FULL

33:11.253 --> 33:12.454
IN SEVEN YEARS.

33:12.488 --> 33:14.792
LET'S SET THIS UP
FOR 14 RIGHT NOW.

33:14.825 --> 33:17.095
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.600
ALL RIGHT, NOW, THEY'VE GOT
A 14 TOP JUST ARRIVED.

33:19.633 --> 33:20.969
AND THIS IS
A TRUE TEST NOW,

33:21.002 --> 33:22.338
BECAUSE FAMILY STYLE

33:22.371 --> 33:23.907
SHOULD MAKE THEIR LIFE
A LOT EASIER.

33:23.940 --> 33:25.443
OR IT CAN GO
AND BE A DISASTER.

33:25.476 --> 33:27.012
IT'S SO BUSY.

33:27.046 --> 33:31.119
TINA, TINA, DO YOU HAVE
A THROAT LOZENGE?

33:31.153 --> 33:32.861
PETER AS AN OWNER,
HE SHOULD STEP UP TO--

33:32.861 --> 33:33.657
PETER AS AN OWNER,
HE SHOULD STEP UP TO--

33:33.691 --> 33:35.860
YOU KNOW, MOVE HIS ASS
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

33:35.894 --> 33:39.533
BECAUSE HE'S IN LA-LA LAND.

33:39.566 --> 33:41.804
PETER, THIS TABLE
RIGHT HERE?
YEAH?

33:41.837 --> 33:44.341
BRING 'EM AN APPETIZER
OR TWO, ALL RIGHT?
THAT'S COOL.

33:44.375 --> 33:47.280
AND WHEN PETER DOES DECIDE
TO LEND A HAND...

33:47.313 --> 33:48.716
I'M SO HUNGRY, MAN.

33:48.749 --> 33:51.854
INSTEAD OF SERVING
THE BAKED CLAMS...

33:51.887 --> 33:53.890
YOU GOT A FORK BACK HERE?
ANYBODY GOT A FORK?

33:53.924 --> 33:55.827
COME ON, I DON'T WANT TO SEE
GORDON SEE ME EATING.

33:55.860 --> 33:57.630
I DON'T WANT
TO GET YELLED AT.

33:57.664 --> 33:59.567
HE DECIDES
TO SAMPLE THEM.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.505
OH, MAN.

34:02.538 --> 34:02.861
PETER--
EXCUSE ME, PETER!

34:02.861 --> 34:04.675
PETER--
EXCUSE ME, PETER!

34:04.708 --> 34:05.877
I GOTTA ASK YOU
FOR ONE FAVOR--

34:05.910 --> 34:07.012
IT'S DELICIOUS.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.448
ROBERT!

34:08.482 --> 34:09.751
WHAT?

34:09.784 --> 34:12.722
WHAT THE
IS GOING ON HERE?

34:12.755 --> 34:14.158
OFF, YEAH?

34:14.191 --> 34:15.560
GO AND LOOK AT YOUR STOMACH
IN THE WINDOW.

34:15.594 --> 34:16.762
LET'S GO.

34:19.533 --> 34:21.904
ANOTHER DOZEN?

34:21.937 --> 34:23.540
I'M STILL WAITING
ON MY BAKED CLAMS.

34:23.573 --> 34:24.776
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TAKE CARE YOU.

34:24.809 --> 34:27.079
I'LL BRING IT TO YOU.

34:27.112 --> 34:29.984
GUYS, SHOULD I COME BACK
NEXT WEEK FOR THE BAKED CLAMS?

34:30.017 --> 34:32.488
SHOULD I GO DOWN THE BLOCK
FOR THE OTHER RESTAURANT?

34:32.522 --> 34:32.861
I PROMISE YOU,
YOU'LL HAVE IT.

34:32.861 --> 34:34.124
I PROMISE YOU,
YOU'LL HAVE IT.

34:34.158 --> 34:36.829
OKAY, DINING ROOM'S
FILLING UP.

34:36.862 --> 34:39.433
NEW MENU, NEW KITCHEN,
NEW FAMILY STYLE DINING.

34:39.467 --> 34:41.403
BUT PETER IS MY CONCERN
RIGHT NOW.

34:41.436 --> 34:42.872
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

34:42.906 --> 34:44.241
I'LL TAKE A CAPPUCCINO--
IF YOU CAN MAKE ME--

34:44.275 --> 34:45.343
WITH TWO EQUALS, PLEASE?

34:45.377 --> 34:47.146
IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT.

34:47.180 --> 34:49.449
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
MY LEGS HURT, MY--

34:49.483 --> 34:51.052
IT WAS HARDER
THAN THE GYM.

34:51.085 --> 34:53.123
IT WAS REALLY HARDER
THAN THE GYM.

34:53.156 --> 34:55.259
WHEN GORDON PUTS
THE PRESSURE ON PETER...

34:55.293 --> 34:58.231
THEY WAITED 50 MINUTES
FOR THEIR  CLAMS.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.302
PETER TAKES IT OUT
ON HIS STAFF.

35:00.335 --> 35:02.104
WHAT THE
IS SHE DOING?

35:02.138 --> 35:02.861
NOBODY'S HERE.

35:02.861 --> 35:03.272
NOBODY'S HERE.

35:03.307 --> 35:04.441
NO ONE CAME
TO YOUR TABLE YET?

35:04.474 --> 35:05.476
NOT AT ALL.

35:05.510 --> 35:07.046
NICOLE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

35:07.079 --> 35:08.648
YOU DIDN'T GO
TO THESE PEOPLE'S TABLE?

35:08.682 --> 35:10.318
I DON'T CARE WHAT IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE.

35:10.351 --> 35:11.787
TAKE IT RIGHT NOW,
RIGHT NOW.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.489
HE WAS YELLING AT ME
IN FRONT OF MY CUSTOMERS

35:13.523 --> 35:15.760
FOR THINGS
THAT I DIDN'T DO.

35:15.794 --> 35:17.663
"IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE MY TABLE."

35:17.697 --> 35:19.633
IMAGINE THIS.

35:19.666 --> 35:21.270
IT'S HARD FOR HIM
TO, YOU KNOW,

35:21.303 --> 35:22.304
REALIZE THAT HE DID
SOMETHING WRONG.

35:22.338 --> 35:23.640
HE TAKES IT OUT
ON EVERYBODY ELSE.

35:23.673 --> 35:25.042
LET'S GET THEM
ONE BOTTLE ON ME RIGHT NOW

35:25.076 --> 35:28.949
FOR ALL YOUR COMEDY
OF ERRORS TONIGHT.

35:28.983 --> 35:30.552
THANK YOU, SO YOU COST ME
A BOTTLE OF WINE.

35:33.724 --> 35:35.827
JUST GET THEM THE BOTTLE
OF WINE, PLEASE.

35:35.860 --> 35:37.263
I DON'T KNOW WHY PETER'S
TEMPER'S LIKE THAT.

35:37.296 --> 35:39.834
MORON.

35:39.867 --> 35:41.403
I MEAN,
HE'S IN EVERYBODY'S WAY.

35:41.436 --> 35:42.672
EVERYBODY ELSE JUST
BRUSHES IT OFF,

35:42.705 --> 35:44.808
BUT I GUESS I JUST
TAKE IT A LITTLE PERSONAL

35:44.842 --> 35:46.979
WHEN HE'S SCREAMING AT ME
IN FRONT OF MY TABLE, SO...

35:47.013 --> 35:49.249
WHAT THE
IS GOING ON WITH A7?

35:52.889 --> 35:54.258
HARD ON YOU?

35:55.928 --> 35:57.297
HOW CAN I BE
A HARD PERSON TO TALK TO?

35:57.330 --> 35:58.197
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

35:58.231 --> 35:59.600
WELL, IF YOU NEED

35:59.633 --> 36:01.069
TO TALK TO ME

36:01.102 --> 36:02.204
I WOULD RATHER
YOU TALK TO ME

36:02.238 --> 36:02.861
LIKE BACK HERE.

36:02.861 --> 36:03.240
LIKE BACK HERE.

36:03.273 --> 36:04.642
HOW COULD YOU CRY?

36:04.676 --> 36:06.612
SHE WAS LIKE A MACHINE GUN.

36:06.645 --> 36:08.748
SHE JUST STARTED SHOOTING
ALL THIS STUFF OUT.

36:08.782 --> 36:10.251
SHE LOOKED LIKE
SHE WAS HAVING

36:10.284 --> 36:11.787
SOME SORT OF MELTDOWN.

36:11.820 --> 36:13.523
I DON'T MAKE THE DRINKS.
I DON'T MAKE THE FOOD.

36:13.557 --> 36:15.493
THIS IS RIDICULOUS HERE.

36:15.527 --> 36:17.630
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

36:17.663 --> 36:19.066
RELAX.
JUST TURN IT DOWN A BIT.

36:19.099 --> 36:20.435
TURN--HEY.

36:20.468 --> 36:23.039
OH, MY GOD, I'VE NEVER
SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

36:27.547 --> 36:29.483
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.

36:29.516 --> 36:31.252
WITH OVER 200
SATISFIED CUSTOMERS,

36:31.286 --> 36:32.861
THE RE-LAUNCH
IS A SUCCESS...

36:32.861 --> 36:33.590
THE RE-LAUNCH
IS A SUCCESS...

36:34.959 --> 36:38.098
IN SPITE OF PETER.

36:38.131 --> 36:39.700
THIS PLACE WAS A SUCCESS,

36:39.734 --> 36:41.536
AND IT'S NOW PISSED
THROUGH YOUR HANDS.

36:41.570 --> 36:43.406
WELL, IT IS WHAT--
IT WAS WHAT IT IS.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.408
YOU'VE NEGLECTED IT.

36:44.441 --> 36:45.744
I UNDERSTAND,

36:45.777 --> 36:47.013
BUT RIGHT NOW
WE'RE NOT IN A SITUATION

36:47.046 --> 36:47.847
MONEY-WISE TO FIX IT.

36:47.880 --> 36:50.953
WELL,
WHAT'S THE TIME?

36:50.986 --> 36:52.154
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS?

36:52.187 --> 36:53.523
YOU'RE  LITTLE SALON

36:53.556 --> 36:55.794
TO GET YOUR MASSAGE
AND GET FED?

36:55.827 --> 36:57.897
YOU'RE  WALKING
AROUND THIS PLACE

36:57.930 --> 37:00.101
WITH A BOWL OF FOOD
IN YOUR  HAND,

37:00.135 --> 37:01.904
EATING AWAY.

37:04.375 --> 37:06.578
THAT'S NOT HOW I RUN
MY  BUSINESS.

37:09.750 --> 37:11.620
I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE SEEN A DAY'S WORK

37:11.653 --> 37:13.322
FOR  20 YEARS.

37:13.357 --> 37:15.827
I--I'VE HAD MY OWN PERSONAL
PROBLEMS IN THE LAST YEAR.

37:15.860 --> 37:17.630
WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS.

37:17.663 --> 37:19.634
PROBLEM, PROBLEM,
PROBLEM, PROBLEM, PROBLEM.

37:19.667 --> 37:20.936
YOU'RE NO DIFFERENT.

37:20.969 --> 37:23.339
LET'S START WORKING
AT THE PROBLEM.

37:23.373 --> 37:24.675
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

37:24.708 --> 37:26.178
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
YOU!

37:26.211 --> 37:28.515
THAT'S WHERE I'M STARTING.
EXCUSE ME?

37:33.723 --> 37:35.393
HE'S  NUTS,
THIS GUY.

37:35.426 --> 37:37.062
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I'M  NUTS.

37:37.096 --> 37:38.064
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT
TO WORRY ABOUT

37:38.098 --> 37:38.933
RIGHT NOW, HAVE YOU?

37:38.966 --> 37:40.469
LISTEN TO ME.

37:40.502 --> 37:41.670
I'M  LISTENING.

37:41.703 --> 37:43.240
LISTEN TO ME.

37:43.273 --> 37:45.243
YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE OUT
OFTHEGODFATHER.

37:45.276 --> 37:47.279
- YEAH?
-  WHAT THE IS GOING ON HERE?

37:50.685 --> 37:52.322
YOU'RE THE ONLY
IN HERE RIGHT NOW

37:52.355 --> 37:53.423
THAT'S NOT PULLING
THEIR WEIGHT,

37:53.456 --> 37:54.425
AND THAT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.

37:58.030 --> 38:01.437
I THINK THIS PLACE
WOULD RUN BETTER WITHOUT YOU.

38:09.654 --> 38:12.974
I THINK THIS PLACE
WOULD RUN BETTER WITHOUT YOU.

38:12.974 --> 38:15.268
I-I-I DISAGREE.

38:15.268 --> 38:16.127
YOU DISAGREE.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.887
I'LL OWN
CERTAIN PROBLEMS,

38:17.887 --> 38:19.390
AND I'LL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR A LOT OF THINGS.

38:19.423 --> 38:20.424
THAT WAS ABOUT AS CONVINCING
AS A...

38:20.458 --> 38:21.326
WHAT THE
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

38:21.360 --> 38:24.498
I'M HERE!

38:24.531 --> 38:26.634
I NEED TWO MINUTES
WITH YOU ON YOUR OWN.

38:26.668 --> 38:27.803
YOU GOT IT.
GOOD NIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

38:27.837 --> 38:30.475
I LOVE HIM!

38:30.508 --> 38:34.582
TONIGHT, GO HOME,
AND COME BACK TOMORROW MORNING,

38:34.615 --> 38:34.916
AND THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA PUT BACK

38:34.916 --> 38:36.218
AND THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA PUT BACK

38:36.251 --> 38:37.253
INTO THE BUSINESS TOMORROW.

38:37.286 --> 38:38.654
THINK ABOUT IT.

38:38.688 --> 38:40.525
AND MAKE SURE
IT'S  GOOD.

38:40.558 --> 38:42.395
'CAUSE I'M GONNA BE HERE
TO MAKE SURE YOU DO IT.

38:44.364 --> 38:45.767
I'M NEVER SPEECHLESS.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.538
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

38:48.571 --> 38:52.043
I'M LIKE--
I'M A LITTLE HURT.

38:52.077 --> 38:53.613
WHAT I'M SEEING NOW IS...

38:53.646 --> 38:55.283
HE SAID TO ME EVERYTHING

38:55.316 --> 38:58.722
ALL THESE PEOPLE WANTED
TO SAY TO ME AND HAVEN'T.

38:58.755 --> 39:02.327
SO MAYBE GORDON'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:02.361 --> 39:04.030
I'M NOT GONNA SAY
MAYBE GORDON'S RIGHT.

39:04.063 --> 39:04.916
GORDON IS RIGHT.
I'M COMMITTED.

39:04.916 --> 39:06.001
GORDON IS RIGHT.
I'M COMMITTED.

39:06.034 --> 39:08.237
I'LL BE BACK,
AND I'LL DO WHAT HE SAYS.

39:08.271 --> 39:09.907
IT'S FOR THE GOOD
OF THE BUSINESS.

39:09.940 --> 39:11.944
AND IN THE END,
THIS PLACE IS ME.

39:11.977 --> 39:13.647
THIS PLACE IS ME.
THIS IS ME.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.016
THIS WHAT I DO,
SO I GOTTA MAKE IT WORK.

39:20.124 --> 39:22.662
TO GORDON'S SURPRISE,

39:22.695 --> 39:25.166
THE NEXT MORNING HE FOUND
PETER ON THE PHONE

39:25.200 --> 39:26.836
CALLING TO FIX
THE WALK-IN FRIDGE.

39:26.869 --> 39:28.738
WE NEED
OUR WALK-IN BOX FIXED.

39:28.772 --> 39:30.408
IT'S LEAKING HERE.

39:30.441 --> 39:32.511
IT'S LIKE LAST YEAR'S
RAINWATER.

39:32.545 --> 39:34.648
I WANT YOU TO COME HERE
AND DO WHATEVER

39:34.682 --> 39:34.916
IT NEEDS TO HAVE DONE.

39:34.916 --> 39:36.551
IT NEEDS TO HAVE DONE.

39:36.585 --> 39:39.089
I'M REALLY AMAZED THAT PETER
IS TAKING THE INITIATIVE

39:39.122 --> 39:40.992
AND PUTTING IN
A NEW WALK-IN BOX.

39:41.025 --> 39:43.630
AND NOW WITH AN ENTIRE
NEW KITCHEN,

39:43.663 --> 39:45.967
ROBERT AND JOHN
HAVE A NEW ATTITUDE.

39:46.001 --> 39:47.637
I'M VERY EXCITED!

39:47.670 --> 39:49.707
I THINK EVERYTHING'S
GOING SO WELL.

39:49.740 --> 39:51.409
UH-HUH.
FAMILY STYLE'S WORKING?

39:51.443 --> 39:52.445
YES.
YEAH?

39:52.478 --> 39:54.348
AND THE FAMILY STYLE DINING

39:54.381 --> 39:56.150
IS A HUGE HIT
WITH THE CUSTOMERS.

39:58.755 --> 40:00.625
I HAVEN'T HAD FAMILY STYLE

40:00.658 --> 40:02.695
DOWN HERE IN BABYLON
IN A LONG TIME.

40:02.729 --> 40:04.298
AND WITH THE WORD
OF MOUTH SPREADING,

40:04.331 --> 40:04.916
PROFITS ARE SOARING.

40:04.916 --> 40:06.101
PROFITS ARE SOARING.

40:06.134 --> 40:08.070
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT,
WE MADE MORE MONEY.

40:08.104 --> 40:09.239
WE MADE MORE MONEY
THIS WAY.

40:09.273 --> 40:11.175
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

40:14.715 --> 40:16.785
TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY,

40:16.818 --> 40:19.390
PETER'S HOSTED THE FIRST EVER
BABYLON FAMILY DAY.

40:21.894 --> 40:24.798
HOLY COW,
LOOK AT THIS!

40:24.831 --> 40:26.569
LOOK AT--

40:26.602 --> 40:29.172
EVERYBODY,
ENJOY THE LASAGNA.

40:29.205 --> 40:30.876
THERE'S LASAGNA.
HELP YOURSELF.

40:30.909 --> 40:33.212
THE FOOD IS GOOD!
REALLY GOOD!

40:33.246 --> 40:34.916
AAH!

40:34.916 --> 40:35.784
AAH!

40:35.817 --> 40:37.520
AAH!

40:37.553 --> 40:40.692
THIS IS A HUGE GREAT START
TO PUSH THE NEW FAMILY THEME.

40:42.761 --> 40:44.264
ALL RIGHT!

40:44.298 --> 40:45.766
COME AND MY FAMILY
WILL SERVE YOURS.

40:48.872 --> 40:51.076
AND TO MAKE
THE RE-LAUNCH COMPLETE,

40:51.109 --> 40:53.714
PETER DECIDED THE RESTAURANT
NEEDED ONE MORE THING.

40:53.747 --> 40:55.216
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER--

40:55.249 --> 40:57.620
MAY THE BLESSING
OF ALMIGHTY GOD,

40:57.653 --> 41:00.291
THE FATHER, THE SON,
AND THE HOLY SPIRIT.

41:00.324 --> 41:03.831
THIS WAS A REBIRTH.
SO IT NEEDED ITS BLESSING.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.370
I GOT A THING
ABOUT HUGGING FATHERS.

41:07.403 --> 41:08.772
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
ALL RIGHT?

41:10.908 --> 41:13.880
IN THE WEEKS AHEAD,
PETER WAS MORE HELPFUL.

41:13.913 --> 41:15.616
YEAH, I'LL GET SOME
EXTRA PLATES TOO.

41:15.650 --> 41:16.652
THANK YOU.

41:16.685 --> 41:18.956
HE MADE AMENDS
WITH NICOLE.

41:18.989 --> 41:21.593
I'M OKAY.
I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?

41:21.626 --> 41:23.630
MY PRIORITIES
WERE MIXED UP.

41:23.664 --> 41:25.767
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BE LIKE,
YOU KNOW, THE BOSS,

41:25.800 --> 41:27.503
I'M GONNA BE
A TEAM PLAYER HERE.

41:27.536 --> 41:28.571
WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE,
I'M GONNA DO IT.

41:28.605 --> 41:30.174
I'M GONNA JUMP IN.

41:30.207 --> 41:31.977
I'M GONNA ASK PEOPLE
IF THEY NEED HELP WITH THINGS.

41:32.010 --> 41:32.845
THERE YOU GO, ENJOY.
I LIKE THAT SHIRT.

41:32.879 --> 41:33.747
THANK YOU.
BEAUTIFUL.

41:33.781 --> 41:34.882
AND EVEN PROVIDED TINA

41:34.915 --> 41:34.916
WITH THE HELP SHE NEEDED.

41:34.916 --> 41:36.251
WITH THE HELP SHE NEEDED.

41:36.284 --> 41:37.620
I MEAN, I'M THRILLED.

41:37.653 --> 41:39.322
I EVEN THINK PETER
WILL DO HIS PART.

41:39.356 --> 41:40.925
I REALLY DO THINK HE'S GONNA
KEEP HIS COMMITMENT.

41:40.958 --> 41:42.796
I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?
I LOVE YOU.

41:42.829 --> 41:45.366
I LOVE YOU TOO.
SORRY.

41:45.399 --> 41:48.204
LET'S JUST CONFIRM
ONE THING, SHALL WE?

41:48.237 --> 41:51.309
WE GOT A TASTE OF HOW GOOD
THIS RESTAURANT CAN BE.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.812
ABSOLUTELY.

41:52.845 --> 41:54.481
AND JUST COMPARING
TO WHAT I EXPERIENCED

41:54.514 --> 41:56.151
THE FIRST TIME
I ARRIVED HERE,

41:56.185 --> 41:59.290
TONIGHT, THE DIFFERENCE
WAS NIGHT AND DAY.

41:59.323 --> 42:00.926
BEFORE GORDON GOT HERE,

42:00.959 --> 42:02.395
THIS PLACE WAS NOSE-DIVING.

42:02.428 --> 42:04.916
THE MAN REINVENTED
MY RESTAURANT.

42:04.916 --> 42:05.567
THE MAN REINVENTED
MY RESTAURANT.

42:05.600 --> 42:09.072
I THINK NOW HE'S GIVEN US
ALL OUR SPARK BACK.

42:09.106 --> 42:12.010
IF YOU CANNOT MAKE
THIS WORK, YOU'RE MAD.

42:12.044 --> 42:13.713
YOU'VE GOT A POTENTIAL
GOLD MINE HERE

42:13.747 --> 42:15.149
THAT CAN MAKE
EVERY ONE OF YOU

42:15.182 --> 42:17.220
SUCCESSFULLY  RICH.

42:17.253 --> 42:20.158
WE ARE DEFINITELY ON OUR WAY
TO SUCCESS HERE.

42:20.191 --> 42:22.428
NOW WE HAVE TO TAKE THE BALL
AND RUN WITH IT.

42:22.461 --> 42:23.864
THANK YOU
FOR THE COMMITMENT.

42:23.897 --> 42:25.366
YEAH, YEAH.

42:25.399 --> 42:27.437
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN
ALL THE HELP IN THE WORLD.

42:27.470 --> 42:28.705
TIME FOR US TO SHINE,
AND WE GOT WHAT WE NEED.

42:28.738 --> 42:30.475
AND I'M READY TO DO IT.

42:30.509 --> 42:32.545
GOOD NIGHT, BABE.
MWAH!

42:32.578 --> 42:34.548
ALL OF GORDON'S IDEAS
STEMMED TO KEEP

42:34.581 --> 42:34.916
THIS RESTAURANT
SYNONYMOUS WITH FAMILY.

42:34.916 --> 42:36.919
THIS RESTAURANT
SYNONYMOUS WITH FAMILY.

42:36.952 --> 42:38.588
WE ALL LOVE EACH OTHER,

42:38.622 --> 42:41.493
SO THAT'S MY MAIN INGREDIENT
NOW FOR THE RESTAURANT.

42:41.527 --> 42:43.931
AND I THINK
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT.

42:43.964 --> 42:48.605
$3,000 FOR ALL THAT
EXTRA MATERIAL.

42:48.639 --> 42:51.276
TAKE CARE.

42:51.309 --> 42:53.313
I REALLY FELL
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

42:53.346 --> 42:54.181
MY FIRST SON IS GONNA BE
NAMED AFTER GORDON.

42:54.214 --> 42:55.583
GORDON RAMSAY PELLEGRINO.

42:55.616 --> 42:56.618
GORDON REALLY BROUGHT
OUR FAMILY

42:56.652 --> 42:58.087
MUCH CLOSER TOGETHER.

42:58.121 --> 43:01.059
GOOD NIGHT, BUDDY, YES.
THANK YOU.

43:01.059 --> 43:02.918
IF THIS FAMILY
CAN STAY TOGETHER

43:02.918 --> 43:04.052
AND COMMIT TO THE RESTAURANT,
IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

43:04.086 --> 43:04.916
BUT STOP  FIGHTING.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.356
BUT STOP  FIGHTING.
