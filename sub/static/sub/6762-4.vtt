01:44.269 --> 01:46.760
Look, l can help you manage
your finances.

01:46.939 --> 01:49.727
lt's what l do, and l do it very well.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.606
But if you keep putting this off,
two things will happen.

01:52.822 --> 01:55.064
You will be flat broke.

01:55.242 --> 01:57.615
And you will be in a lot of pain.

01:58.288 --> 02:00.779
lf you don't take care of it now,
the courts will step in.

02:00.958 --> 02:03.710
And when that happens,
all hell will break loose.

02:04.630 --> 02:10.053
And frankly, l think you have
a moral responsibility here as well.

02:11.848 --> 02:15.894
Do you have any idea
how really serious this is?

02:16.062 --> 02:18.269
Yeah, l guess l do.

02:19.233 --> 02:22.852
Okay. Do you know
what you have to do, Dylan?

02:23.030 --> 02:25.985
You get on a plane,
you go to Hawaii,

02:26.159 --> 02:28.448
and you make peace
with your mother once and for all.

02:29.873 --> 02:34.370
l wish it were that simple.
You don't understand my mother.

02:36.006 --> 02:39.292
Yes, but l do understand
a desperate situation when l see one.

02:41.013 --> 02:45.178
All my life, she threw money at me
and called it love.

02:45.353 --> 02:48.604
l didn't ask for love.
But to ask for money?

02:48.774 --> 02:52.191
But if you don't,
you'll be asking for a lot worse.

03:21.444 --> 03:23.318
Ready to lose all your money?

03:23.488 --> 03:24.947
- What money?
- Come on.

03:25.116 --> 03:27.654
Tomorrow night in the game room.
An hour after the club closes.

03:27.828 --> 03:29.987
Steve, l keep telling you.
l'm not coming.

03:30.164 --> 03:32.869
l work too hard for my money
to waste it playing poker.

03:33.043 --> 03:34.585
Besides, l'm not even that good at it.

03:34.754 --> 03:37.625
That's exactly why l think you'd be
an asset to the game. You stink.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.959
Thanks for the vote of confidence,
Steve.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.758
But, you know, you're gonna stink
a lot worse in about a minute.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.592
You know where these towels
have been?

03:44.768 --> 03:47.805
They got paddle tennis sweat,
sauna sweat, aerobics sweat,

03:47.980 --> 03:50.471
and something
from the shower room floor.

03:50.651 --> 03:51.896
l'm not even sure what it is.

03:52.111 --> 03:56.406
- No, come on. No, come on.
- Toxic waste, coming through.

03:58.119 --> 04:00.326
Hey, does Sea Shell Laundry
have anything strong enough

04:00.498 --> 04:02.158
to sanitize this guy?

04:02.375 --> 04:03.953
Get me out of here, man.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.921
- Hi, Dylan.
- Hi.

04:09.677 --> 04:11.469
Got you some bread
at the Beverly Bakery.

04:11.638 --> 04:13.880
You mustn't feel you have to do
something special for us

04:14.058 --> 04:15.517
just because you're staying here.

04:15.685 --> 04:18.769
l know. l wanted to.

04:19.565 --> 04:22.055
- lt's for me. l'll get it.
- Okay, honey.

04:22.236 --> 04:25.606
Yeah, l know it's a difficult time
for you and your father.

04:25.782 --> 04:29.318
Well, you guys are making it
much easier.

04:30.914 --> 04:32.492
- Dylan?
- Yeah?

04:34.211 --> 04:35.753
Could you use some pocket money?

04:36.464 --> 04:38.587
No. l--

04:38.758 --> 04:41.131
No, l mean, thank you,
but l'm fine, really.

04:43.557 --> 04:45.764
Of course you are.

04:52.110 --> 04:54.317
Hi. Where's Kelly?

04:54.655 --> 04:57.491
She decided to go to Newport Beach
with her mom after all.

04:58.744 --> 05:00.618
Okay, did we decide on a movie?

05:00.831 --> 05:03.038
Well, l thought we could figure
that out in Westwood.

05:03.543 --> 05:04.918
Donna, l hate that.

05:05.086 --> 05:07.874
We end up standing on the corner
arguing and we miss the movie.

05:08.091 --> 05:10.000
Well, we can argue here
if you want.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.256
ls Dylan coming?

05:12.179 --> 05:13.757
You know, as you may recall,

05:13.932 --> 05:16.008
Brenda Walsh and Dylan McKay
broke up and--

05:16.227 --> 05:18.184
Well, it doesn't have
to be a date, you know.

05:18.355 --> 05:20.846
lt could be more
of a group type of thing.

05:21.025 --> 05:23.813
Or l could be Dylan's date.

05:23.987 --> 05:26.443
l mean, if it would
make things easier.

05:27.492 --> 05:30.030
Okay, fine. Dylan!

05:31.831 --> 05:34.204
Do you wanna go to the movies?

05:34.377 --> 05:37.129
No, thanks. l'll just stay here.

05:37.339 --> 05:39.083
Oh, come on. lt's our treat.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.467
Dylan McKay, charity case.

05:42.847 --> 05:45.054
- What?
- Nothing. l just--

05:45.225 --> 05:48.844
l'd rather, you know, hang around here
and maybe do some reading.

05:50.148 --> 05:52.188
- What's going on with him?
- You know what, Donna?

05:52.360 --> 05:55.315
l don't know and l don't wanna
think about it. Let's just go, okay?

06:28.952 --> 06:31.954
Yes, Brandon.
l knew you'd come through.

06:32.123 --> 06:33.617
You're all right.

06:33.792 --> 06:35.785
Do you remember my cousin Paul
from Beverly High?

06:35.961 --> 06:37.954
- How you doing, Paul?
- This is Danny Waterman.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.839
He graduated
West Beverly two years ago.

06:40.009 --> 06:41.503
He invited me
to my first poker game.

06:41.678 --> 06:43.089
- How's it going?
- How you doing?

06:43.263 --> 06:45.552
You ready to lose a little money?

06:45.725 --> 06:47.184
Great. You told him too?

06:47.352 --> 06:49.760
Why don't l just give my wallet now
and save everybody time?

06:49.939 --> 06:51.766
Hi, l'm David Silver.
You already know me.

06:51.942 --> 06:53.686
- How's it going?
- Sorry about that, David.

06:53.861 --> 06:55.569
- lt's his first game too.
- Obviously.

06:55.739 --> 06:56.984
Yeah, l'm feeling lucky.

07:01.204 --> 07:03.956
Okay, boys, let's play some cards.

07:04.125 --> 07:07.127
Wow! l've never been here at night.
This is great.

07:07.296 --> 07:10.582
- Would you guys keep it down?
- Brandon, there's no one else here.

07:10.759 --> 07:11.874
lt's okay. Trust me.

07:12.094 --> 07:14.502
l just feel like the walls have ears
or something, you know?

07:14.681 --> 07:17.766
Brandon, don't be such a squeef, huh?
Kids have been doing this for years.

07:17.977 --> 07:19.721
Yeah, but l haven't been
letting them in.

07:19.897 --> 07:20.928
This is a great monitor.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.899
Personally, l like
the rear-projection ones.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.566
We've got this 50-inch TV at home,
it's incredible.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.358
But this has like
twice the brightness.

07:27.574 --> 07:29.947
Hello, are we gonna play cards
or just chitchat, girls?

07:30.119 --> 07:31.911
Let's go, come on.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.165
This is a great stereo,
l can't believe you don't crank this up.

07:35.376 --> 07:37.452
- David, just leave it alone, okay?
- Just one song.

07:37.630 --> 07:39.089
Please, please, please.

07:39.799 --> 07:41.591
Yeah, fine, but quietly, all right?

07:41.885 --> 07:44.293
Brandon, come on,
we're here to have some fun.

07:44.472 --> 07:46.132
Yeah. Right. Fun.

07:46.308 --> 07:48.217
- All right, let's go. How much to in?
- Five.

07:48.394 --> 07:51.764
- David, come on.
- Come to papa.

07:51.941 --> 07:55.311
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.

08:13.721 --> 08:15.429
All right.

08:29.493 --> 08:30.656
Silver, what are you doing?

08:32.205 --> 08:35.076
l'm working on my poker face.

08:39.673 --> 08:41.832
l raise you this.

08:48.185 --> 08:49.845
l fold.

08:50.021 --> 08:52.477
- Outstanding.
- All right, l knew you'd have fun.

08:52.649 --> 08:54.227
What did l tell you?

08:54.402 --> 08:56.442
You told me l stink.

08:56.613 --> 08:59.235
- He told me that too.
- You told David he stinks?

08:59.409 --> 09:02.327
No. He told me that you stink.

09:04.749 --> 09:07.454
- You're a great pal.
- Come on.

09:08.171 --> 09:10.294
You guys should have been here
two, three years ago.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.545
Why?

09:11.717 --> 09:13.959
First of all,
this wasn't just a poker game.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.252
This was the traditional

09:15.431 --> 09:17.424
Ross Wienerblatt
All-Night Poker Club

09:17.600 --> 09:19.225
and Chamber Music Society.

09:20.312 --> 09:21.723
Who the hell is Ross Wienerblatt?

09:21.940 --> 09:24.016
That's part of the mystery.
Nobody knows.

09:24.527 --> 09:26.401
But he had chamber music?

09:26.613 --> 09:30.149
No, no, he didn't have chamber music.
That was just the name of the game.

09:30.326 --> 09:32.900
Nobody really knows
where it came from for sure.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.998
But it's been going on
for 20 years or so.

09:36.168 --> 09:41.875
Once or twice every summer.
And always at night.

09:42.843 --> 09:46.794
You see, the thing was,
we'd dress like high rollers.

09:46.974 --> 09:48.349
You know, like we were from Vegas.

09:48.518 --> 09:51.769
Because you gotta show that you
have respect for the game of poker.

09:51.939 --> 09:55.772
We got these big cigars
and Frank Sinatra music playing.

09:55.945 --> 09:57.404
The whole package.

09:57.864 --> 10:01.281
But the best thing,
the best thing about it

10:01.452 --> 10:04.323
was that we'd have these girls,
these gorgeous chicks.

10:04.498 --> 10:08.331
And they'd just sit next to us
for luck.

10:09.589 --> 10:11.665
- Wow.
- Cool.

10:12.217 --> 10:14.969
Of course, the main thing was
we played for real stakes.

10:15.138 --> 10:17.095
Not this penny-ante stuff.

10:18.935 --> 10:20.180
Well, guys, l gotta book.

10:21.230 --> 10:25.774
But if you ever wanna play
for real change, give me a holler, huh?

10:28.156 --> 10:31.775
- Hang loose.
- You hang loose too.

10:33.079 --> 10:34.953
Penny-ante?

10:56.445 --> 10:58.734
Oh, sorry, man.
l was trying not to wake you up.

10:58.906 --> 11:00.650
No, l was up.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.866
What, laying in the dark
with your eyes closed?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.575
- l was thinking.
- What about?

11:05.791 --> 11:07.700
Hawaii.

11:07.877 --> 11:10.879
Hawaii. Sounds nice.

11:11.340 --> 11:13.167
Yeah.

11:13.343 --> 11:16.179
- So, what did you do tonight?
- l was playing cards down at the club.

11:16.347 --> 11:18.340
Should have been there, man.
lt was a good time.

11:18.517 --> 11:20.142
You guys play for big money?

11:20.895 --> 11:22.639
Well, the stakes weren't really--

11:22.814 --> 11:25.981
Oh, man, there's no thrill if you don't
stand to lose all your money.

11:26.194 --> 11:27.569
Gambling is like bungee jumping.

11:27.738 --> 11:30.360
You jump and you're pretty sure
you're gonna bounce back.

11:30.533 --> 11:33.784
But would anybody really do it

11:33.955 --> 11:38.084
if there wasn't that tiniest
little possibility that the cord will snap?

11:39.587 --> 11:40.915
What do you have, a death wish?

11:41.799 --> 11:42.997
No way, man.

11:43.176 --> 11:45.584
You won't catch me
jumping off of any bridges.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.928
You just like a little excitement
in your games, right?

11:49.100 --> 11:52.552
Yes, l do.
Which is why l don't gamble.

11:52.730 --> 11:55.601
lt's just another physical addiction.

11:55.776 --> 11:59.691
A real gambler, he isn't in it to win,
or even to lose.

11:59.865 --> 12:02.902
lt's when the cards are being dealt,
or the dice is rolling.

12:03.078 --> 12:05.486
Or the roulette wheel is spinning.

12:05.665 --> 12:07.409
That's when your body releases
a chemical

12:07.584 --> 12:10.040
that's more powerful than booze.

12:11.423 --> 12:15.422
Adrenaline.
What a tremendous rush.

12:16.012 --> 12:17.590
So are you a real gambler?

12:18.432 --> 12:23.095
l don't know.
But with my past, why risk it?

12:25.734 --> 12:27.643
Enough said, buddy.

12:27.820 --> 12:30.276
- Good night.
- Night.

12:44.426 --> 12:46.170
Thanks, Dylan.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.604
- Walsh.
- Hey, good morning, Henry.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.191
Yeah, morning. Listen.

13:00.365 --> 13:02.987
When you left last night,
did you notice anyone around?

13:03.161 --> 13:05.569
Who would l have noticed?

13:05.747 --> 13:08.073
Then they must've come in
after you left.

13:08.251 --> 13:10.789
- They who?
- Some of the member's kids.

13:11.005 --> 13:14.007
l mean, most of them are nice, but
every year, we get a few spoiled brats

13:14.176 --> 13:17.877
who sneak in here and play cards
in the middle of the night.

13:18.056 --> 13:19.087
How do you know?

13:19.266 --> 13:21.674
l found some poker chips on the floor
of the game room table

13:21.853 --> 13:23.727
and some of those
cheese thingamadoozies

13:23.897 --> 13:25.012
squished into the carpet.

13:25.483 --> 13:26.942
Well, it sounds pretty harmless.

13:27.152 --> 13:29.394
lf somebody falls,
gets hurt in the middle of the night

13:29.572 --> 13:32.360
sneaking around here,
it's gonna be on my shoulders.

13:36.915 --> 13:39.241
- l'm sorry.
- lt's not your fault.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.171
Listen, l'll tell you what. You probably
know some of these kids.

13:42.339 --> 13:43.917
lf you hear anything,
let me know, okay?

13:44.134 --> 13:45.759
l mean, l won't say where l heard it.

13:45.928 --> 13:47.043
Sure, no problem.

13:47.764 --> 13:51.465
You know, it just bugs me when
rich kids think they own the world.

14:00.823 --> 14:02.068
What can l get for these?

14:02.576 --> 14:05.150
- l suppose all this stuff is yours?
- Yeah.

14:05.329 --> 14:08.533
- You got any receipts?
- lt's mostly gifts.

14:08.709 --> 14:11.497
- Gifts, huh?
- Yeah.

14:11.964 --> 14:14.372
l bought the guitar myself.

14:14.801 --> 14:17.506
l suppose you're gonna tell me
it's worth more than it is, right?

14:17.721 --> 14:18.752
l love this guitar.

14:18.931 --> 14:21.933
- l learned to play on this guitar.
- l can't use this.

14:22.144 --> 14:23.259
What can you use?

14:24.731 --> 14:29.644
Electronics. VCRs, TVs, stereos.

14:30.489 --> 14:32.648
Two-seventy-five for the lot.
Take it or leave it.

14:37.707 --> 14:39.747
l'll take it.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.832
Probably wanna keep this.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.500
Picture of the girlfriend, huh?

14:47.679 --> 14:49.257
Actually, it's my mother.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.466
Taken a long time ago
when she was younger.

14:51.685 --> 14:53.678
lt's mostly how l remember her.

14:55.690 --> 14:58.146
- Sorry.
- She's not dead.

14:58.361 --> 14:59.772
She just lives in Hawaii.

15:00.405 --> 15:03.775
Well, she looks real nice.

15:04.828 --> 15:06.287
Yeah.

15:06.455 --> 15:09.575
l'll go get the papers
and your money.

15:09.793 --> 15:12.711
You have 90 days
to redeem your items.

16:06.121 --> 16:08.328
Now, observe the shadow
of the antenna

16:08.499 --> 16:11.287
and orient the blanket
exactly parallel to it.

16:12.755 --> 16:16.125
That's to give us
the most even exposure to the sun.

16:16.301 --> 16:18.210
Yeah, but if we turn it this way,

16:18.387 --> 16:20.795
we can now watch
the boys play volleyball.

16:20.974 --> 16:22.005
Donna, please.

16:22.184 --> 16:25.768
Who wants to spend their whole day
watching guys in shorts?

16:28.067 --> 16:29.442
Wienerblatt, tonight, midnight.

16:29.611 --> 16:31.070
Pass it on.

16:31.238 --> 16:33.646
Hey. Hey, what's going on?

16:33.825 --> 16:36.495
Sanders, you promised we wouldn't
get into trouble for last night.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.323
Now Henry found out
about the poker game.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.040
- He knows it was us?
- No, he doesn't.

16:40.209 --> 16:43.045
Then don't worry about it, Brandon.
Just chill out, come on.

16:43.213 --> 16:44.411
- Henry works for us.
- No, no.

16:44.590 --> 16:46.132
Henry works for you
and l work for him.

16:46.301 --> 16:47.332
And you're my friend.

16:47.553 --> 16:49.380
And l've been here
a lot longer than you have.

16:49.555 --> 16:51.049
And l say we do it right.

16:51.224 --> 16:55.270
An all-night, old-fashioned
Ross Wienerblatt Poker Club.

16:55.438 --> 16:57.063
No.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.727
High stakes.
Could mean some car cash.

16:58.901 --> 17:00.229
- No.
- Cigars?

17:00.404 --> 17:02.444
- No.
- Babes?

17:02.615 --> 17:05.189
Which babes?
Oh, God, what am l saying? No.

17:05.368 --> 17:06.400
Brandon, come on.

17:06.579 --> 17:09.249
lt's gonna happen whether you
come or not so you may as well come.

17:09.415 --> 17:12.038
- What, and lose my job?
- All right.

17:12.211 --> 17:13.789
You can make sure
we cover our tracks.

17:13.964 --> 17:16.372
You don't understand.
Henry takes his job very seriously.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.425
l don't like the idea
of walking all over him.

17:18.595 --> 17:20.718
You won't have to.
l will let everybody in.

17:20.890 --> 17:23.381
lt won't be your responsibility.

17:24.770 --> 17:26.762
Come on, Brandon.

17:27.523 --> 17:29.268
Come on, Brandon.

17:31.029 --> 17:33.900
- All right, l knew you'd come through.
- l'll think about it.

17:39.833 --> 17:42.040
Okay, it's time to turn over.

17:51.057 --> 17:54.308
- Sunscreen.
- Okay.

17:55.563 --> 17:58.268
- What protection factor?
- Fifteen.

17:58.442 --> 18:03.022
Here, you wanna use 25.

18:03.198 --> 18:06.116
lt's peak tanning hours.
Trust me, l'm your friend.

18:06.328 --> 18:08.155
Thank you.

18:09.457 --> 18:11.201
Here, wanna take this quiz?

18:11.376 --> 18:14.247
''Should you live with your lover?''

18:14.422 --> 18:16.331
No, thanks.

18:17.593 --> 18:19.337
- Bren?
- Yeah?

18:20.430 --> 18:22.803
What's it like having Dylan
living with you in your house?

18:23.309 --> 18:24.934
l said l didn't wanna take the quiz.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.019
So you two are lovers.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.850
Not.

18:29.025 --> 18:32.192
But still, l mean,
having him there every day,

18:32.363 --> 18:34.155
watching him across
the breakfast table.

18:34.324 --> 18:35.355
Oh, please.

18:35.534 --> 18:39.367
Passing him in the hallway,
surprising him in the shower.

18:39.540 --> 18:43.289
- Donna.
- By accident, of course.

18:45.298 --> 18:48.134
Look, if you really
wanna know the truth,

18:48.302 --> 18:51.138
it's gotten to the point where Dylan
and l barely talk to each other.

18:51.515 --> 18:53.389
- Are you kidding?
- He's gotten so moody.

18:53.559 --> 18:56.181
l mean, all he does
is sit in his room all day.

18:56.396 --> 18:59.516
He barely says a word
to me or Brandon.

19:00.193 --> 19:01.771
This is really hard to talk about.

19:02.822 --> 19:04.364
lt's okay.

19:06.619 --> 19:10.203
l guess deep down inside,
l still love him.

19:10.791 --> 19:13.543
And it hurts
not to be able to help him.

19:15.005 --> 19:19.134
lt's like Dylan's father
isn't the only one that's in jail.

19:21.848 --> 19:24.090
Well, l think l'm done with the sun.

19:24.268 --> 19:25.846
You want a milk shake? lt's on me.

19:26.354 --> 19:29.938
No, thanks.
l still have six and a half minutes left.

19:30.109 --> 19:31.437
Okay.

19:56.312 --> 19:58.388
Hi, sweetheart.

20:00.526 --> 20:04.311
l'm sorry.
l got more sun than l expected.

20:05.950 --> 20:08.987
Honey, you are burned to a crisp.

20:09.163 --> 20:10.278
l know.

20:10.999 --> 20:13.325
l fell asleep. l mean, it's not fair.

20:13.502 --> 20:16.457
Just because l take a nap,
now l can't go to this party with Donna.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.206
She's getting dressed up right now
and l'm here, fried.

20:19.594 --> 20:22.549
Don't worry, mama has an
old family remedy to take the sting out.

20:23.433 --> 20:25.722
lt's not that disgusting
pink goop, is it?

20:25.936 --> 20:28.262
Come upstairs, you'll see.

20:29.316 --> 20:32.650
Wow, Bren.
You really got a lot of colour.

20:32.821 --> 20:35.573
Very observant, Dylan.

20:36.075 --> 20:41.034
l meant that as a compliment,
or so he thought.

20:49.343 --> 20:52.095
Anything interesting happen
in the world today?

20:52.681 --> 20:54.757
l don't know.

20:54.934 --> 20:57.057
Did you get in touch
with your mother yet?

20:57.229 --> 20:58.640
l will.

20:58.815 --> 21:02.232
Because if you wanna use the phone,
go ahead. Just dial direct.

21:03.071 --> 21:06.904
Dylan, l can't keep having
the same conversation with you.

21:09.997 --> 21:11.824
l'm sorry.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.666
l know that you're just trying
to help me out and l'll take care of it.

21:24.308 --> 21:26.100
What do you need a tie for?

21:26.269 --> 21:29.021
Hey, we're doing
that poker thing again.

21:29.190 --> 21:31.266
Thanks for the invite.

21:31.443 --> 21:33.103
l thought you had
a problem with gambling.

21:33.279 --> 21:35.687
We're not gonna be playing
for nickels, dimes and quarters.

21:35.866 --> 21:38.440
The adrenaline's
really gonna be pumping.

21:38.620 --> 21:42.749
You Walsh people, always looking out
for my best interests.

21:43.334 --> 21:44.959
Look, if you wanna come, come.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.922
No, that's all right.
l'll just stay here and read.

21:48.466 --> 21:49.711
Fine.

22:33.946 --> 22:36.568
- Blue.
- l'll see the blue. She's gonna see it.

22:36.741 --> 22:40.241
- Come on, let's get it going, guys.
- l'll see the blue and l'll raise.

22:40.413 --> 22:43.498
- All right, dealer's in.
- Blue and red.

22:43.667 --> 22:46.538
- Show me the turn.
- Let's see them, boys.

22:46.713 --> 22:49.002
Because l think you're gonna
be weeping when you see--

22:49.175 --> 22:50.919
- Show them.
- Let's go, read them and weep.

22:51.094 --> 22:52.422
- Look at this.
- Check it out.

22:52.596 --> 22:54.922
- What you got? You got nothing.
- l got a king, queen--

22:55.100 --> 22:57.009
- You got nothing. You got nothing.
- l got--

22:57.186 --> 22:58.680
You got-- You got nothing.

22:58.855 --> 23:02.225
Oh, Paul's the winner,
he's got a three-ace hand going.

23:02.401 --> 23:04.145
- Wait a minute.
- Out.

23:04.321 --> 23:05.780
Look out.

23:06.407 --> 23:08.400
l got it.

23:09.536 --> 23:11.529
l thought you said there
were gonna be some babes.

23:12.832 --> 23:15.370
No, don't get me wrong,
Brenda, Donna.

23:15.545 --> 23:17.170
You're great babes,
really great babes.

23:17.339 --> 23:20.294
But Brenda's my sister
and l already know Donna.

23:20.468 --> 23:22.212
l mean, l thought you meant,
you know,

23:22.387 --> 23:24.179
some new babes,
some fresh babes.

23:24.348 --> 23:25.723
These are fresh babes.

23:25.934 --> 23:29.101
Well, l'm enjoying myself.
This is all very sophisticated.

23:29.272 --> 23:31.680
Yes, and the cigar
definitely adds a graceful touch.

23:31.859 --> 23:33.484
Yes.

23:42.790 --> 23:45.163
Hey, Dave, you gonna light
that thing or what?

23:45.336 --> 23:47.163
Are you kidding?
lt could stunt my growth.

23:47.380 --> 23:49.005
Too late.

23:51.636 --> 23:54.306
Well, l've had enough
of these things.

23:54.473 --> 23:56.430
So let's get down to business, huh?

23:56.643 --> 23:58.303
How about it?
Why don't we play Anaconda?

23:58.479 --> 24:00.472
l'm the dealer
and we're not gonna play Anaconda,

24:00.648 --> 24:02.226
because Anaconda is heinous.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.518
Okay.

24:04.695 --> 24:06.320
Deal me in.

24:14.918 --> 24:16.033
Dylan, you sure?

24:17.505 --> 24:19.664
l said...

24:21.343 --> 24:23.051
...deal me in.

24:33.485 --> 24:35.063
l'm in.

24:35.696 --> 24:37.356
Me too.

24:39.034 --> 24:42.570
- Limit's 50 bucks, right?
- That's right.

24:45.794 --> 24:50.256
l'll call. And l'll raise you 50.

24:52.428 --> 24:54.635
- Foldage.
- l'm out.

24:54.848 --> 24:57.007
- Me too.
- Forget me.

24:57.768 --> 25:00.604
- David?
- How much for me to stay in?

25:00.814 --> 25:02.273
Seventy-five big ones.

25:05.529 --> 25:07.321
Okay.

25:08.033 --> 25:10.156
David, don't be a yutz.

25:10.327 --> 25:12.534
Come on,
Dylan hasn't bluffed all night.

25:14.834 --> 25:16.032
Your cards aren't that good.

25:16.252 --> 25:18.209
l'm winning. lt's okay.

25:19.423 --> 25:21.749
- What you got?
- l don't show mine.

25:21.968 --> 25:23.379
Well, excuse us.

25:25.223 --> 25:27.714
Do you see what l'm talking about?

25:32.024 --> 25:34.313
So, Dylan, how many cards?

25:34.903 --> 25:36.066
l stand.

25:38.575 --> 25:40.069
Big Dave?

25:46.836 --> 25:49.624
- Two. No, no, no, three.
- David, just--

25:49.840 --> 25:51.085
- Three. Three.
- Two or three?

25:51.300 --> 25:52.711
Three.

25:58.894 --> 26:00.269
Make it 50.

26:08.407 --> 26:09.782
l raise 50.

26:16.251 --> 26:19.787
- B, spot me 50?
- Sorry, buddy, l'm wiped.

26:20.549 --> 26:22.091
Steve, my credit good with you?

26:22.552 --> 26:24.260
Yeah. Sure.

26:28.810 --> 26:30.803
Pot stands at $400.

26:33.859 --> 26:34.974
So, what you got?

26:43.330 --> 26:45.157
One ace.

26:46.501 --> 26:48.660
And four twos.

26:49.422 --> 26:52.424
Damn it.
A full boat and l take a dive.

26:52.760 --> 26:56.675
Ladies and gentlemen,
it has been real.

27:00.395 --> 27:01.973
Dylan, you gonna be all right?
You okay?

27:02.148 --> 27:05.399
Yeah, man, l'm all right.
l just gotta unwind a little bit.

27:05.569 --> 27:07.526
l'm gonna go upstairs
and take a sauna.

27:07.697 --> 27:10.319
Go back, you play.
l'll just let myself out later.

27:10.493 --> 27:12.035
Maybe take a drive up the coast.

27:12.203 --> 27:16.118
Listen, l'm really sorry.
l tried not to get you involved in all this.

27:16.334 --> 27:17.912
Look, man, l don't need
the Walsh family

27:18.086 --> 27:19.331
watching out for me, all right?

27:19.505 --> 27:21.047
l can take care of myself.

27:27.725 --> 27:28.804
Shall l deal?

27:29.018 --> 27:31.509
This game is way over my head.
l'm done.

27:31.689 --> 27:33.516
- Me too.
- Brandon?

27:36.153 --> 27:40.234
This is starting to get a little weird.
l say we just cash out and go home.

27:40.910 --> 27:42.369
Okay.

27:45.499 --> 27:47.326
You don't know her, Steve.
She's a Laker Girl.

27:47.502 --> 27:49.329
- l've seen her on TV.
- That doesn't count.

27:49.505 --> 27:50.916
l've got a projection TV, Brandon.

27:51.090 --> 27:52.917
l know her a lot better
than you might think.

27:53.093 --> 27:55.216
- Dog.
- Hey, Sanders.

27:55.388 --> 27:57.761
- l wanna ask you a question.
- Shoot.

27:57.933 --> 28:00.222
Did you have a poker game
here last night?

28:01.313 --> 28:02.807
- Of course not.
- Are you sure?

28:02.982 --> 28:06.482
Well, absolutely.
l was with Brandon all last night, right?

28:07.655 --> 28:09.612
Yeah, right.

28:09.783 --> 28:11.408
Why? What's wrong?

28:11.577 --> 28:13.534
What's wrong?

28:13.705 --> 28:14.985
l'll show you what's wrong.

28:19.254 --> 28:22.588
Remember the TV,
and the stereo equipment

28:22.800 --> 28:24.294
and everything else?

28:26.013 --> 28:28.635
This club had a major burglary
last night.

28:42.745 --> 28:43.990
Thanks a lot.

28:44.163 --> 28:46.868
Here's the list of the items
that were taken, as best l can figure.

28:47.042 --> 28:50.127
VCRs, TVs, sound system,
office equipment.

28:50.297 --> 28:53.797
And l'll bet it's all been fenced by now.
This stuff moves fast.

28:54.469 --> 28:56.628
Do you have any idea who did it?

28:56.847 --> 28:58.472
Well, there was no forced entry.

28:58.641 --> 29:02.342
So it was probably someone with keys
or some access.

29:02.814 --> 29:05.305
Someone who knew their way around
this place pretty well.

29:05.526 --> 29:09.192
Who knew right where to go
and what to go for.

29:09.865 --> 29:12.191
Come with me, l'll show you
where to dust for prints.

29:13.203 --> 29:14.366
lt's an inside job, Henry.

29:14.538 --> 29:16.864
Should make it
a little easier to figure out.

29:17.042 --> 29:19.616
lt's not gonna make it easier on me.

29:19.796 --> 29:22.714
What do you mean?
lt cuts down on the suspects.

29:22.883 --> 29:26.169
l just wish it was somebody
from the outside.

29:27.598 --> 29:29.306
Why?

29:29.476 --> 29:30.851
lt doesn't matter.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.597
lt's not like they're gonna blame you.

29:35.525 --> 29:40.521
Sooner or later, they're gonna find out
that l've got an old police record.

29:41.325 --> 29:42.404
You do?

29:42.577 --> 29:44.071
Yeah, l was a little older than you,

29:44.955 --> 29:49.250
and out cruising with my buddies.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.543
Anyway, l fell asleep
in the back seat of the car

29:51.714 --> 29:56.211
and my friends get this brilliant idea
to rip off a house in Culver City.

29:56.846 --> 29:57.925
To make a long story short,

29:58.098 --> 30:01.053
l wake up and l'm being charged
with breaking and entering,

30:01.228 --> 30:03.020
same as the others.

30:03.189 --> 30:05.941
- That's not fair.
- That doesn't matter. lt happened.

30:06.151 --> 30:08.227
And it's gonna come up again.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.439
l just wanted you to hear it
from me first.

30:13.953 --> 30:16.444
Mr. Thomas?
Would you come with me?

30:16.624 --> 30:19.412
We'd like to have a word
with you privately.

30:20.921 --> 30:22.380
Sure.

30:23.383 --> 30:24.961
Excuse me.

30:31.519 --> 30:33.892
What are you smiling about,
laughing boy?

30:34.064 --> 30:35.724
- Come on. This is weird.
- Weird?

30:37.194 --> 30:38.569
Do you have any idea what you did?

30:38.779 --> 30:41.270
Hey, l had nothing to do
with this robbery. This is funny.

30:41.450 --> 30:43.988
l'm not even talking about this.

30:45.538 --> 30:46.949
Man, you got me to lie to Henry.

30:47.166 --> 30:48.993
Oh, come on. lt was a little white lie.

30:49.168 --> 30:52.086
Maybe it is to you
but not to me and not to Henry.

30:52.965 --> 30:54.507
l'm gonna go straighten
this thing out.

30:54.676 --> 30:55.956
Hey, Brandon, you'll get fired.

30:56.178 --> 30:58.966
You don't care about my job, man.
And you don't care about Henry.

30:59.141 --> 31:01.348
All you care about is Steve Sanders.

31:02.019 --> 31:03.217
Don't blow this, Brandon.

31:06.526 --> 31:09.528
You're telling me your employers
didn't even know about your history?

31:09.697 --> 31:12.948
- All that had been taken care of--
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.904
Young man, l'm afraid
l'm going to have to--

31:15.079 --> 31:17.202
l know more than l let on
about last night.

31:27.346 --> 31:30.466
Really, detective,
l didn't think there'd be any problem.

31:30.684 --> 31:32.344
l've been going to these games
for years,

31:32.561 --> 31:34.020
there's never been any trouble.

31:34.189 --> 31:36.727
These games were always at night?

31:36.901 --> 31:40.520
- Eleven, 1 2, 1 :00.
- After the club was closed.

31:40.698 --> 31:45.361
- Well, yeah. That's kind of the point.
- And always without permission?

31:45.955 --> 31:49.075
Our parents are all members,
so we really didn't think--

31:49.251 --> 31:51.410
So you're telling me
that you have a history

31:51.588 --> 31:55.005
of trespassing
at the Beverly Hills Beach Club?

32:00.725 --> 32:03.680
Once when l was 7,
l took gum from a supermarket

32:03.855 --> 32:06.144
but my mother made me
bring it back.

32:06.608 --> 32:08.150
That's all l remember.

32:08.319 --> 32:10.645
You've been very helpful.

32:10.822 --> 32:13.693
Really? Thanks.

32:14.286 --> 32:16.991
- Do you know who my mom is?
- No, l don't.

32:17.164 --> 32:20.415
So you let the others into the club
after it was closed for the night?

32:20.586 --> 32:22.745
Yeah, but then l made sure
the door locked behind them

32:22.922 --> 32:24.796
when they came in
and then after we all left.

32:24.967 --> 32:27.719
- How did you do that?
- Well, the door kind of clicked.

32:27.888 --> 32:30.759
- lt kind of clicked?
- Bingo.

32:30.933 --> 32:33.056
- Now, can l leave?
- No.

32:33.270 --> 32:37.185
So l understand
you won big last night.

32:37.901 --> 32:39.693
Who, me?

32:41.072 --> 32:44.489
l had a cigar.

32:45.078 --> 32:46.572
l threw up.

32:48.624 --> 32:51.626
So Dylan McKay didn't leave the club
with the rest of you?

32:51.795 --> 32:53.539
No, l guess he left later.

32:53.715 --> 32:55.257
Did he say why he was staying,
Brandon?

32:55.467 --> 32:58.172
l don't know.
Maybe he was a little depressed.

32:58.388 --> 32:59.633
Depressed, why?

33:02.393 --> 33:04.220
Well, he'd lost a lot of money
in the game.

33:04.438 --> 33:06.312
And his family's in financial trouble?

33:06.816 --> 33:09.901
l guess you know his father
is Jack McKay. He's in jail.

33:10.112 --> 33:12.983
- What about his mother?
- She lives in Hawaii.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.199
He hasn't seen her
in a long time though, about 1 0 years.

33:16.746 --> 33:19.202
But listen, even if Dylan
was in financial trouble,

33:19.375 --> 33:20.454
he wouldn't steal anything.

33:20.627 --> 33:22.287
- lt's not like him.
- You know him well?

33:22.463 --> 33:26.082
Yeah. l mean,
as well as anyone can.

33:27.303 --> 33:29.841
Well, okay, Brandon.
Thanks, you've been very helpful.

33:30.015 --> 33:31.842
No, no problem.

33:32.685 --> 33:35.093
So do you think you'll catch
whoever did it?

33:36.023 --> 33:38.265
We're keeping up
an active investigation.

33:39.653 --> 33:43.023
Be sure to let your friend McKay know
we'd like to have a word with him.

33:53.923 --> 33:55.667
Hey, Dylan. When did you get back?

33:55.842 --> 33:56.921
Just now.

33:57.094 --> 33:59.764
Hey, no offence, man,
but you look pretty beat.

34:00.265 --> 34:06.020
Yeah, well, last night l slept in my car
at the Ventura County line.

34:06.189 --> 34:08.098
l had a lot of thinking to do,
you know?

34:09.277 --> 34:10.855
Did you hear the club got ripped off?

34:11.071 --> 34:12.446
No kidding.

34:13.699 --> 34:15.242
Yeah, last night
after the poker game.

34:15.409 --> 34:17.449
Someone broke in,
stole a bunch of equipment.

34:17.621 --> 34:20.992
Hauled us all down to the police station
today for questioning.

34:22.085 --> 34:24.659
They want to talk to you too,
since you were there.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.378
Okay. l guess l'll get around to it.

34:27.552 --> 34:28.831
ls the shower free?

34:29.012 --> 34:32.429
Yeah, it's all yours.

34:46.078 --> 34:48.996
l thought l heard you in the shower.
l was gonna go use Mom's bathroom.

34:49.165 --> 34:51.074
No, that was Dylan.

34:51.251 --> 34:52.661
- Oh, he's back?
- Yeah.

34:52.837 --> 34:56.538
l just wish he'd keep all his stuff
on his own side of the room.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.839
Well, how do you like that?
Dylan's going to Hawaii.

35:03.018 --> 35:05.094
No, he's not. He told me
he won't go see his mother.

35:05.271 --> 35:07.180
Well, looks like he changed
his mind.

35:07.357 --> 35:09.730
lt would have been nice
if he would've told us, huh?

35:09.902 --> 35:12.440
Well, he didn't change his mind
until this morning. You see?

35:12.614 --> 35:14.073
Ticket was made up today.

35:14.241 --> 35:15.272
He bought it today?

35:15.451 --> 35:18.488
But he lost all his money
in the game last night.

35:18.664 --> 35:20.123
Well, maybe he charged it.

35:20.333 --> 35:22.207
No, he doesn't have
any credit cards anymore.

35:22.419 --> 35:24.661
He got the money somewhere, okay?
Just leave him alone.

35:24.881 --> 35:26.126
No, no, wait a minute.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.753
The club gets ripped off last night,

35:28.970 --> 35:32.885
now all of a sudden, Dylan has money
and is blowing town in two days?

35:33.101 --> 35:35.094
Brandon, l can't believe
you're saying this.

35:35.270 --> 35:36.301
He's not blowing town.

35:36.480 --> 35:39.018
l mean, where do you get off
having this attitude?

35:39.192 --> 35:41.897
You know, admittedly Dylan
may be getting on both of our nerves.

35:42.113 --> 35:44.236
But he is not a thief, he is our friend.

35:54.755 --> 35:57.591
- Hello?
- Hi, l'm Detective Pena.

35:57.801 --> 35:59.545
l spoke with your children
earlier today.

36:00.138 --> 36:01.597
So l understand.
How can l help you?

36:01.807 --> 36:03.385
ls Dylan McKay here?

36:03.601 --> 36:06.472
- Yes.
- ls that his Porsche?

36:06.647 --> 36:07.762
The one in the driveway?

36:07.982 --> 36:11.316
The one with the VCR,
amplifier and fax machine

36:11.528 --> 36:14.613
packed in behind the seats,
sticking out from under a blanket?

36:16.619 --> 36:18.030
Well, l don't know.

36:18.580 --> 36:22.080
l'm here to ask Dylan McKay
to come downtown for questioning.

36:30.847 --> 36:32.923
l just feel so bad for Dylan.

36:33.142 --> 36:34.802
l mean, first this thing
with his father.

36:34.977 --> 36:37.932
And then to be hauled off
by the police like a criminal.

36:38.107 --> 36:40.314
He said the stuff in his car was his,
not the club's.

36:40.485 --> 36:41.648
Why can't anyone believe him?

36:41.820 --> 36:44.775
l'd like to believe him, Brenda.
He's my friend.

36:45.408 --> 36:48.326
l just wish it made sense
that he happened to be driving around

36:48.538 --> 36:50.911
right after the robbery
with his VCR, his amp,

36:51.125 --> 36:52.667
and his fax machine
hidden in his car.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.666
- lt wasn't hidden.
- lt was under a blanket.

36:55.839 --> 36:58.627
Well, maybe that's so
it wouldn't get stolen.

36:59.803 --> 37:01.083
Brenda.

37:01.264 --> 37:05.013
Hey, don't look at me.
l said Dylan was innocent all along.

37:06.855 --> 37:09.393
ls Detective Pena still in
with the McKay boy?

37:09.567 --> 37:10.730
Yes.

37:10.902 --> 37:12.694
Like father, like son.

37:14.448 --> 37:17.022
- What makes you say that?
- Excuse me?

37:18.120 --> 37:20.742
Well, has he been formally charged
with anything?

37:20.916 --> 37:22.161
No.

37:22.334 --> 37:24.707
Then why are you condemning him
for what his father did?

37:24.879 --> 37:27.715
- Or might have done.
- Jim, please.

37:28.301 --> 37:29.499
What are you, his lawyer?

37:29.845 --> 37:32.171
No, just somebody who's gotten
to know him a little bit.

37:32.807 --> 37:35.559
Yeah, well, nice talking to you.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.809
Well, what about your father?

37:40.651 --> 37:41.682
Way to go, Dad.

37:45.616 --> 37:46.695
We'll be in touch.

37:48.746 --> 37:52.365
Hey, you guys all waited for me.

37:54.253 --> 37:56.709
- Thanks.
- How you doing?

37:57.216 --> 37:58.841
All right.

38:00.428 --> 38:02.551
- So how'd it go?
- All right.

38:13.446 --> 38:16.566
- You done yet?
- What?

38:16.742 --> 38:19.946
l said, are you done yet?
There's a water shortage, you know.

38:20.122 --> 38:22.162
Yeah, just give me a second.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.125
Oh, don't use
all my shampoo either.

38:24.294 --> 38:26.417
Oh, forgot. You already did that.

38:26.589 --> 38:29.294
What the hell is your problem?
And don't say shampoo.

38:29.468 --> 38:31.876
Oh, the shampoo is just for starters.

38:32.055 --> 38:34.131
Look, Brandon.

38:34.559 --> 38:36.967
You have been real nice
about helping me out and everything.

38:37.145 --> 38:39.019
And l don't want to seem,
you know, ungrateful.

38:39.190 --> 38:40.982
But l gotta know.
What is wrong with you?

38:41.151 --> 38:42.396
What did l do?

38:42.611 --> 38:44.355
That's between you and the police,
isn't it?

38:44.531 --> 38:46.690
- Wait a minute--
- No, don't worry. l'll never tell.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.659
- Tell what?
- Oh, l don't know,

38:48.828 --> 38:50.370
about the pawn tickets
in my trash can.

38:50.539 --> 38:53.030
lf you've been smart,
you wouldn't have hid them there.

38:53.209 --> 38:55.451
l could've told the police that
and put you behind bars.

38:55.671 --> 38:57.628
Behind bars for what,
hawking my own stuff?

38:57.841 --> 39:00.415
Yeah, right, l know what you have.
lt's strewn all over my room.

39:00.594 --> 39:02.088
Listen to me for a minute, will you?

39:02.263 --> 39:05.715
That was my stuff,
l just wasn't keeping it here.

39:07.687 --> 39:10.807
Do you know what it's like, man,
to go to your family's storage locker

39:10.984 --> 39:13.689
day after day
and just pick up one more thing

39:13.863 --> 39:16.485
that you can sell off to stay afloat?

39:16.658 --> 39:19.778
One day, it's my skis,
next day, my guitar.

39:19.996 --> 39:23.615
And then the watch
that my grandfather gave me.

39:24.168 --> 39:28.214
lt's like selling off your life,
piece by piece.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.211
Everything you remember is gone.

39:32.638 --> 39:35.426
Why do you think that stuff
was in my car?

39:38.980 --> 39:40.772
What about your ticket to Hawaii?

39:42.026 --> 39:43.770
l'm finally gonna see my mother.

39:44.572 --> 39:47.408
Your mother, the flake,
who you don't even wanna talk to?

39:47.576 --> 39:49.201
Didn't.

39:50.288 --> 39:52.993
And how could you afford a ticket
after you lost big in poker?

39:53.709 --> 39:58.419
l called her, spoke with her,
and she paid for it.

39:58.591 --> 40:00.548
l picked it up at the airport.

40:03.389 --> 40:04.552
Why didn't you tell me?

40:06.560 --> 40:09.134
- l couldn't.
- You couldn't?

40:10.816 --> 40:14.102
l'm not the kind of guy
that runs home to mom.

40:23.917 --> 40:27.750
Hey, little lady,
can l buy you a snack?

40:28.549 --> 40:30.043
Please.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.343
Bren, haven't you had
enough of the sun?

40:37.519 --> 40:39.263
Who, me?

40:40.857 --> 40:43.265
l just laugh at the sun.

40:55.878 --> 40:59.212
- ls now a good time?
- Give me a few seconds.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.427
Walsh.

41:07.602 --> 41:08.847
Do l still work here?

41:15.780 --> 41:18.402
You know, l could be royally ticked
you lied to me.

41:18.618 --> 41:22.367
Or l could be glad that you told
the detective the truth.

41:23.458 --> 41:25.250
l don't know.

41:25.419 --> 41:27.708
l think maybe l'll be both for a while.

41:28.506 --> 41:29.704
So that means?

41:33.430 --> 41:37.345
Yeah, stick around. Why not?

41:38.103 --> 41:39.478
Thank you, Henry.

41:39.646 --> 41:41.105
l mean, Walsh,

41:41.274 --> 41:44.525
somewhere inside there,
there's a pretty decent kid.

41:44.695 --> 41:47.650
Maybe we can pry him out
by the end of the summer, huh?

41:48.534 --> 41:50.194
Hey, Walsh. Good news.

41:50.370 --> 41:52.410
You know the Los Angeles
Beach Club up the road?

41:52.623 --> 41:55.375
They got hit last night.
The exact same kind of robbery.

41:56.336 --> 41:58.625
That's great news, Henry.

41:58.840 --> 42:01.676
No, no, this time they caught
the guys in the act.

42:01.844 --> 42:04.715
And you know who it was?
You're not gonna believe this.

42:04.890 --> 42:08.057
- Who?
- lt's the Sea Shell Laundry Service.

42:08.269 --> 42:10.760
- The same one we use?
- The same one all the clubs use.

42:10.981 --> 42:13.354
Or maybe l should say ''used.''

42:16.155 --> 42:18.907
Hey, Henry, this doesn't mean
l'm gonna have to take all the towels

42:19.076 --> 42:21.069
to the laundry myself now, does it?

42:21.245 --> 42:25.030
We'll see, Walsh. We'll see.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.456
- l gotta go call Dylan.
- Already did.

42:40.021 --> 42:41.646
l came to say goodbye.

42:49.242 --> 42:50.522
Oh, does that hurt?

42:51.120 --> 42:54.038
- No, it's much better now.
- Yeah.

42:54.207 --> 43:00.294
Listen, it was really great
how you stuck by me during all this.

43:00.466 --> 43:02.459
lt was easy. l believed you.

43:02.636 --> 43:06.551
l wish it was that easy for me.
l didn't always believe in myself.

43:06.933 --> 43:09.471
l was beginning to think
there was more of my father inside me

43:09.645 --> 43:11.187
than l had originally thought.

43:12.482 --> 43:14.439
Yeah, well, l think Brandon
was maybe beginning

43:14.610 --> 43:15.938
to wonder the same thing.

43:16.154 --> 43:20.105
Well, it would make sense to him.
l mean, he's a lot like his father.

43:20.869 --> 43:23.574
l like that about your brother.

43:23.748 --> 43:26.418
Anyway, Brenda,
l want you to promise me

43:26.627 --> 43:29.035
that while l'm gone,
you have a good time, okay?

43:29.840 --> 43:32.510
Yeah, right. You too.

43:32.719 --> 43:35.507
Oh, l'm beginning to think l will.

43:35.931 --> 43:37.758
l mean, if l can stand it here
with you guys,

43:37.934 --> 43:41.351
l figure me and Mom got
a good shot at working it out.

43:41.564 --> 43:42.595
Oh, very funny.

43:42.816 --> 43:44.939
- Just one request.
- What?

43:45.152 --> 43:48.438
For God's sakes, woman,
stay out of the sun.

44:02.551 --> 44:03.666
You wanna check my luggage,

44:03.845 --> 44:06.134
see if there's any
of your stuff in there?

44:08.393 --> 44:11.098
Listen, man, l'm sorry
l put you through all that.

44:11.272 --> 44:12.932
l should've had more faith in you.

44:13.108 --> 44:15.730
Yeah, well,
l needed a kick in the butt

44:15.903 --> 44:18.691
to get me going on
this little adventure anyway.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.443
Besides, we're past that, aren't we?

44:21.786 --> 44:23.280
l don't know, are we?

44:24.415 --> 44:28.116
- Yeah, we are.
- Cool.

44:28.337 --> 44:31.125
- Oh, hey, listen. Before l forget.
- Oh, man.

44:31.299 --> 44:34.135
- l got you a little going-away present.
- You didn't have to do that.

44:34.303 --> 44:35.714
Oh, l did. l did.

44:35.889 --> 44:37.716
lt's not the swankiest present
in the world,

44:37.892 --> 44:40.300
just a bottle of shampoo,
but l know you use the stuff and--

44:40.479 --> 44:45.226
What--? You know, it's funny,
because l got you something too.

44:46.529 --> 44:48.356
A replacement.
