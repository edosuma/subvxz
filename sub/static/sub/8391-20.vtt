WEBVTT

00:00.890 --> 00:02.198
- I'M NOT PREGNANT!
- OKAY.

00:02.240 --> 00:04.026
- I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR
FOUR MONTHS.

00:04.070 --> 00:06.470
IT'S SOMETHING CALLED
"INTRAUTERINE SCARRING.â€˜l

00:06.520 --> 00:07.441
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:07.490 --> 00:08.821
- I REALLY WANTED
TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.622
- YOU WERE UP ALL NIGHT
WRITING.

00:10.660 --> 00:14.482
- YOUR MOTHER HAS WRI'I'I'EN
A PLAY, AND IT'S FANTASTIC.

00:14.530 --> 00:17.454
- GILLIAN T. BLOUNT.
- DO YOU WANT TO BE A WRITER?

00:17.500 --> 00:19.832
- YES.
- I MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.802
- TELL ME WHY YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN GOING TO BERKELEY.

00:21.840 --> 00:22.807
- IT'S A GREAT SCHOOL.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.158
- I SPOKE TO THE DEAN
OF ADMISSIONS TODAY,

00:24.190 --> 00:26.806
AND YOU DgDHN'T GET IN.

00:26.850 --> 00:27.771
- WHAT YOU DID TO ME
MAKES ME SICK.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.367
WHAT YOU DID TO
OUR FAMILY MAKES ME SICK.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.743
- WE ARE A FAMILY,
AND I WILL DO ANYTHING

00:31.790 --> 00:34.782
TO GET YOU
TO FORGIVE ME, I SWEAR.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.853
WE MET AT A WEDDING...

00:40.900 --> 00:45.485
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT--

00:45.520 --> 00:48.455
I MEAN, I GUESS EVERYONE
GETS LUCKY AT A WEDDING.

00:48.490 --> 00:51.209
- IF I COULD WRITE OUT
MY OWN DREAM

00:51.250 --> 00:53.810
- THEN THIS
ADORABLE FIVE-YEAR-OLD

00:53.840 --> 00:55.569
SHOWS UP ON MY DOORSTEP.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.228
YOU KNOW, THIS TALL...

00:58.260 --> 01:02.708
AND BIG, HUGE EYES,
AND THIS FUNNY SMILE.

01:02.750 --> 01:03.842
SO WHEN I ASKED HER
TO MARRY ME,

01:03.890 --> 01:06.575
ALL I HAD WAS THIS
PLASTIC SPIDER RING.

01:06.610 --> 01:09.124
SO APPARENTLY,
THERE'S A RIGHT AND WRONG WAY

01:09.170 --> 01:11.684
TO LOAD A DISHWASHER.
AND THEN SHE STARTS IN WITH,

01:11.720 --> 01:13.164
"YOU DON'T EVER
WANT TO MAKE DECISIONS,"

01:13.210 --> 01:14.609
OR, "YOU'RE NOT
A TEAM PLAYER,"

01:14.660 --> 01:16.548
OR, "YOU CAN DISCIPLINE
YOUR KID"--MY KID!

01:16.590 --> 01:19.798
HER HAIR ALWAYS SMELLED
LIKE CHAMOMILE AND VANILLA

01:19.830 --> 01:21.479
FROM HER SHAMPOO.

01:21.520 --> 01:25.866
SO I BOUGHT A BOTTLE
SO I COULD SMELL HER.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.523
THIS GIRL WORKED FOR MY BROTHER
AND ALL I REMEMBER

01:30.570 --> 01:33.118
IS ORANGE JUICE
FLYING EVERYWHERE.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.116
SHE WON'T TALK TO ME,
WON'T TAKE MY CALLS,

01:35.160 --> 01:38.152
WON'T ANSWER EMAILS.
IF IT WEREN'T FOR JABBAR,

01:38.200 --> 01:40.361
I DON'T THINK
SHE WOULD EVEN...

01:40.410 --> 01:41.786
DEAL WITH ME.

01:41.820 --> 01:43.230
I JUST WANT TO
MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.124
I WANT TO GET MY FAMILY BACK,

01:45.170 --> 01:48.651
AND I WANT TO BE FORGIVEN
AND MAKE A HOME FOR US

01:48.690 --> 01:50.510
SO WE CAN ALL LIVE IN IT
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

01:52.940 --> 01:54.931
- WHAT ARE THESE?
LIKE, DOOR PRIZES OR SOMETHING?

01:54.970 --> 01:57.211
- THEY'RE STARS, AND
THEY'RE GONNA HANG AND TWINKLE.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.933
IT'S GONNA BE ROMANTIC.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.210
THE THEME
IS MIDNIGHT IN PARIS.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.559
- [French accent]
AW, BUT OF COURSE, PAREE.

02:03.600 --> 02:07.661
- YEAH.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.918
[giggIeSJ
DO YOU WANT TO GO?

02:10.950 --> 02:11.882
- GO WHERE?
PARIS?

02:11.920 --> 02:15.435
- UM...
TO PROM.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.235
- OH.

02:18.270 --> 02:21.683
- MM.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.199
- I JUST--

02:23.240 --> 02:26.209
I DON'T THINK
I'M A PROM GUY.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.889
- I THINK IT'S
GONNA BE REALLY FUN.

02:27.940 --> 02:32.559
AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
LOOK REALLY CUTE IN A TUXEDO.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.421
DOES THAT SOUND STUPID?

02:35.460 --> 02:39.396
- HADDIE, I WOULD BE HONORED
TO BE YOUR PROM DATE.

02:39.430 --> 02:41.978
- OKAY.
- MM-HMM.

02:42.020 --> 02:43.635
- GREAT.
- SO.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.636
- [giggIeSJ

02:45.680 --> 02:50.504
[phone ringing]

02:50.540 --> 02:51.984
- [laughing]

02:52.030 --> 02:53.474
YES, JULIA,
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION?

02:53.510 --> 02:54.545
- HI.

02:54.580 --> 02:55.751
- WOW.
- I KNOW.

02:55.790 --> 02:56.950
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
THANK YOU.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.649
- YOU'RE A REALLY LOUSY
ICE SKATER.

02:58.690 --> 02:59.725
- NO, I'M A GOOD SKATER.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.988
I JUST HAD AN INCIDENT.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.268
- I'M SORRY, DOES IT HURT?
- ANYWAY.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.003
NO, IT'S FINE.
ANYWAY, OKAY.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.792
THESE ARE FOR YOU.
- OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.455
I GO THROUGH PAPER
VERY QUICKLY NOW.

03:07.490 --> 03:09.424
- GOOD, SO WHAT'S
THIS PRODUCER GUY DO?

03:09.460 --> 03:11.769
- OH, MY GOSH,
HE GIVES DEADLINES AND SUPPORT

03:11.810 --> 03:13.869
AND MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE
THE WHOLE THING IS FOR REAL.

03:13.910 --> 03:15.730
YOU KNOW?
- THAT'S GOOD.

03:15.780 --> 03:17.259
- WE'LL SEE.
SO, HOW DOES THIS WORK

03:17.300 --> 03:19.291
WITH BABY-MAKING, HMM?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

03:19.330 --> 03:23.221
- [giggIeSJ
UM, so FAR IT'S BEEN FUN.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.988
[both giggling]

03:25.030 --> 03:26.713
- BUT...

03:26.750 --> 03:29.503
ACTUALLY, SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT
UP, I TALKED TO THE DOCTOR.

03:29.550 --> 03:31.825
AND IT'S GOING TO BE
DIFFICULT FOR ME

03:31.860 --> 03:32.895
TO CONCEIVE AGAIN.

03:32.930 --> 03:34.818
- THEY ALWANYg SAY THAT.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.748
IT'S REALLY
NOT IN THE CARDS.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.869
SO...
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:37.900 --> 03:39.310
EVE R?

03:39.350 --> 03:40.419
- IT'S OKAY.

03:40.460 --> 03:42.792
- OH, JULIA.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.728
IT'S TOTALLY FINE.

03:44.770 --> 03:46.635
I WAS SAD WHEN
I FOUND OUT, OF COURSE.

03:46.670 --> 03:49.286
BUT I'M SO BLESSED.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.013
I HAVE THE MOST
AMAZING DAUGHTER

03:51.050 --> 03:52.779
AND THE MOST
AMAZING HUSBAND.

03:52.810 --> 03:56.268
AND I'M JUST GONNA
FOCUS ON THE EVERY DAY

03:56.300 --> 03:57.642
THAT I HAVE WITH THEM.
- YEAH.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.568
WELL, YES.

03:59.610 --> 04:01.259
FOCUS ON EVERY DAY,
'CAUSE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

04:01.310 --> 04:03.995
THEY ARE APPLYING TO COLLEGE
AND ALL GROWN UP.

04:04.030 --> 04:05.509
- RIGHT!
OH, MY GOD, HOW'S AMBER?

04:05.550 --> 04:07.518
- GOOD. SHE'S GOOD.

04:07.550 --> 04:08.414
OKAY, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

04:08.450 --> 04:11.624
I KNOW HOW HARD
SHE WAS TAKING BERKELEY.

04:15.390 --> 04:16.903
OH...

04:24.090 --> 04:26.081
- WOW.
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.600
I THINK JASMINE

04:28.640 --> 04:30.084
- MM-HMM.

04:30.130 --> 04:32.883
- HOW MUCH IS IT?
- THEY JUST CUT THE PRICE.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.296
THEY BOUGHT ANOTHER HOUSE

04:34.340 --> 04:36.683
AND THEY NEED TO MOVE IT.
IT'S DOWN T0 1.1.

05:15.830 --> 05:18.060
AND THAT MAKES THAT
"NOSTALGIA" HERE.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.658
- OH, GOD, IT'S SO HARD.

05:20.690 --> 05:22.760
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

05:25.390 --> 05:28.427

05:40.680 --> 05:42.648

HOW TO BRING IT UP WITH YOU.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.363
[sighs]

05:44.410 --> 05:46.128
- BRING WHAT UP?

05:48.450 --> 05:50.509
- I DIDN'T
GET INTO BERKELEY.

05:54.660 --> 05:56.582
- DID YOU
THINK I WOULD BE MAD?

05:56.630 --> 05:59.793
- I WAS JUST...

05:59.840 --> 06:03.560

[sighs]

06:03.600 --> 06:06.114
SAD ABOUT IT, SO I
KNEW YOU'D BE DISAPPOINTED.

06:06.150 --> 06:07.879
AND I JUST--
- I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED...

06:07.910 --> 06:10.799

I'M DISAPPOINTED FOR YOU.

FIGURE OUT WHAT'S NEXT.

06:14.230 --> 06:16.084

06:16.130 --> 06:17.779
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHY I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

06:17.820 --> 06:19.162
BECAUSE...

06:19.200 --> 06:21.998
I'M NOT READY TO MAKE A PLAN
FOR WHAT TO DO NEXT.

06:22.030 --> 06:24.021
I'M NOT READY
TO THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY.

06:24.070 --> 06:27.790
I'M FEELING VULNERABLE
AND UPSET

06:27.830 --> 06:28.990
AND SENSITIVE ABOUT IT

06:29.040 --> 06:31.008
AND I DON'T
WANT ADVICE OR IDEAS.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.143
YOU KNOW,
I JUST WANT YOU TO LISTEN.

06:32.180 --> 06:35.479
AND I JUST CAN'T
TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT

06:35.530 --> 06:37.077
THIS WAY YET, OKAY?

06:37.120 --> 06:39.145
'CAUSE I'M STILL
TOO HURT, OKAY?

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

07:45.560 --> 07:46.492
- I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS,
OKAY?

07:46.530 --> 07:48.634
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.
- HONEY, IT'S PROM.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.080
EVERYBODY
WANTS TO GO TO PROM.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.634
I DIDN'T THINK ALEX WOULD
BECAUSE HE'S OLDER,

07:52.670 --> 07:54.297
BUT IT'S--
- YEAH, I WAS COUNTING ON THAT.

07:54.330 --> 07:55.706
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.672
- HONEY,
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.745
IT'S PROM.

A PARENT AND SCHOOL-SANCTIONED

- REALLY?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.501
- YEAH, YOU KNOW IT,
I KNOW IT,

08:05.550 --> 08:07.131
EVERYBODY WHO'S EVER BEEN
TO A PROM KNOWS IT

08:07.170 --> 08:08.546
AND I THOUGHT
WE DODGED THIS BULLET.

08:08.590 --> 08:09.784
- WELL,
WE NEED TO TRUST HER.

08:09.830 --> 08:10.683
- HONEY,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT TRUST.

08:10.730 --> 08:12.755
THIS IS ABOUT
A ROOM FULL OF TEENAGERS

08:12.800 --> 08:14.961
AND RUNAWAY HORMONES
CAUSING THEM TO LOSE CONTROL.

08:15.010 --> 08:17.319
- I KNOW.
I WENT TO PROM.

08:17.350 --> 08:20.524
- YEAH, I KNOW
YOU WENT TO THE PROM.

08:25.220 --> 08:26.847
- OH, WHAT ABOUT THIS?
THIS IS A LOVELY COLOR.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.632
DO YOU LIK|\IIEOTHIS ONE?

08:28.680 --> 08:29.942
- THAT WAS A TEST. YOU PASSED.
- THANK YOU.

08:29.990 --> 08:31.810
- DO YOU WANT TO SHOW YOUR LEG
OFF LIKE THIS?

08:31.850 --> 08:33.818
- THEY'RE ALL BAD.
- WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO WEAR?

08:33.850 --> 08:35.602
THIS IS KINDA COOL.
- YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.333
- IT'S A LITTLE FROUFY,
ISN'T IT?

08:37.370 --> 08:39.099
- LOOK AT YOU,
FASHIONISTA.

08:39.130 --> 08:40.574
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR DRESS?
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING TO PROM?

08:40.620 --> 08:42.611
- I WOULD NOT BE
CAUGHT DEAD GOING TO PROM.

08:42.660 --> 08:44.059
BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR
ASKING.

08:44.100 --> 08:46.898
- WHY ISN'T SHE GOING?
IT'S ACTUALLY YOUR PROM.

08:46.940 --> 08:48.316
YOU'RE A SENIOR.
- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT MY...

08:48.350 --> 08:49.760
- I COULDN'T TELL YOU.
- VIBE.

08:49.800 --> 08:50.721
- COME ON.
- WE COULD ALL GO

08:50.770 --> 08:52.032
AND WATCH MATCHING SUITS.
- SHE'S SCARED.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.048
- WHAT AM I SCARED OF?
- DANCING.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.308
- AND YOU THINK
THAT'S WHY I WOULDN'T GO?

08:55.360 --> 08:56.736
BECAUSE
I'M SCARED TO DANCE?

08:56.770 --> 08:57.691
- WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO GO?

08:57.740 --> 09:00.595
- DANCING AT PROM
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.562
- SHE'S SCARED THAT
WE'RE ALL GONNA REALIZE

09:02.610 --> 09:05.704
HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE DOESN'T
WANT US TO KNOW THAT SHE IS.

09:05.750 --> 09:06.910
- MM, GREAT
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.916
FLATI'ERY, I LIKE IT.
- I'M JUST SAYING.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.849
IT WOULD BE FUN TO GO...
WITH YOU.

09:11.890 --> 09:13.858
- THAT IS PRETTY
NICE OF YOU TO SAY,

09:13.890 --> 09:15.061
AND I APPRECIATE IT.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.829
BUT I JUST--
- SO YOU'LL COME?

09:16.860 --> 09:18.612
- WHAT, SO IT'LL
JUST BE THE THREE OF US?

09:18.660 --> 09:19.729
I CAN, LIKE, POP
IN BETWEEN YOU GUYS

09:19.760 --> 09:21.307
WHILE YOU'RE SLOW DANCING?
- NO, YOU BRING A DATE.

09:21.350 --> 09:22.487
- YEAH.
- BRING A DATE?

09:22.520 --> 09:25.387
LET'S SEE, WHICH ONE OF
MY ANGRY, TATTOOED FRIENDS...

09:25.420 --> 09:27.388
- OLDER, MALE FRIENDS.
- CAN I CONVINCE

09:27.420 --> 09:30.048
TO COME WITH ME TO PROM?
- I MEAN, BRANDON'S AVAILABLE.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.139
- YEAH, BRANDON!
OH, FROM COMMUNITY CENTER!

09:32.190 --> 09:34.772
- IS HE HOMELESS?
- NO, HE'S NOT HOMELESS.

09:34.810 --> 09:36.254
- HE'S GOT
CUTE BLONDE HAIR.

09:36.290 --> 09:37.359
YOU'D LIKE HIM.
HE'S FUNNY.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.628
I THINK IT'LL BE FUN.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.704
I THINK WE SHOULD
ALL GO TOGETHER

09:39.750 --> 09:42.674
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME
AND TAKE STUPID PICTURES.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.091
IT'LL BE REALLY FUN.

09:45.130 --> 09:46.404
- [whispers]
RIGHT.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.260
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT,
IS THAT OKAY?

09:48.310 --> 09:50.096
IS THAT ENOUGH?

09:50.140 --> 09:51.926
- YEAH.

09:51.970 --> 09:53.926
- THEY ONLY TOOK
THREE AMERICANS EVERY YEAR,

09:53.970 --> 09:55.722
SO IT WAS A BIG HONOR,
YOU KNOW?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.136
- IT IS.
- I'M DOING MY FIRST INTERNSHIP

09:57.180 --> 09:58.966
AT THE ROYAL
SHAKESPEARE COMPANY, OKAY...

09:59.010 --> 09:59.965
- UNBELIEVABLE.

10:00.010 --> 10:02.001
- WITH SIR PETER HALL
DOING HAMLET.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.180
AND EVERY NIGHT,
HE WOULD COME TO THE BOX OFFICE,

10:05.220 --> 10:07.142
AND HE WOULD
ASK FOR THE RECEIPTS

10:07.190 --> 10:08.703
FOR THAT NIGHT'S
PERFORMANCE.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.914
SO ONE NIGHT,
I TOOK A DEEP BREATH,

10:11.950 --> 10:14.703
LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE,
AND SAID...

10:14.750 --> 10:17.196
"WHY DON'T
YOU CUT THE SOLILOQUY?"

10:17.230 --> 10:19.949
- WHAT?
WAIT, WHAT?

10:19.990 --> 10:21.719
YOU TOLD HIM HE SHOULD CUT...

10:21.750 --> 10:23.194
both: "TO BE OR NOT TO BE."
- RIGHT.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.400
- OUT OF HAMLET?
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

10:24.450 --> 10:25.519
- [laughing]

10:25.550 --> 10:27.279
- WELL, NOW THINK ABOUT IT.
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

10:27.310 --> 10:28.959
IT STOPS THE ACTION OF THE PLAY.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.752
I'LL BET YOU A $1,000

10:30.800 --> 10:33.007
IT WAS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL
PRODUCTION,

10:33.040 --> 10:36.794
BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH THE REST OF THE STORY.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.808
AND I SAID, "TAKE IT OUT,

10:38.840 --> 10:41.115
"AND THE SCENE MOVES
LIKE A RAILROAD TRAIN.

10:41.150 --> 10:42.879
THINK ABOUT IT."
AND HE SAYS,

10:42.910 --> 10:44.081
"YOU'RE FIRED."
- [glggleSJ

10:44.120 --> 10:45.803
I BET HE DID.
- HE HAD THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

10:45.850 --> 10:48.705
AND...
BUT A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER,

10:48.750 --> 10:51.810
HE COMES DOWN
AND HE LOOKS AT ME AND SAYS,

10:51.850 --> 10:54.739
"YOU MAY BE RIGHT."
- [gasp5]

10:54.790 --> 10:58.851
- AND THAT'S THE WAY
I GOT MY FIRST DIRECTING JOB.

10:58.890 --> 11:00.687
- OH, WOW.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.301
WOW.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.822
SO WHAT? WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

11:05.870 --> 11:09.033
- BECAUSE I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO
CUT THE FIRST TWO SCENES

11:09.080 --> 11:10.388
OF THE SECOND ACT.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.695
AND YOU'RE
GONNA WANT TO FIRE ME.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.071
- YOU'RE CRAZY.
YOU'RE FIRED.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.759
NO WAY. THAT IS--THAT IS
THE WHOLE SECOND ACT.

11:16.810 --> 11:17.799
- THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT IT.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.944
CUT THE FIRST TWO SCENES,
READ IT,

11:19.980 --> 11:22.392
AND YOU'LL SEE EVERYTHING
YOU NEED IS IN THERE.

11:22.440 --> 11:23.771
- BUT THERE'S--YOU
DON'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION.

11:23.820 --> 11:25.321
I'D HAVE TO REWS%R)K THE END OF--

11:25.370 --> 11:27.156
SO?
REWORK IT.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.986
OKAY.
WHAT IS THAT, THREE DAYS?

11:29.030 --> 11:30.167
- NO.
[scoffs]

11:30.200 --> 11:31.758
FOR YOU, MAYBE.

11:31.790 --> 11:32.927
- SARAH...

11:32.960 --> 11:36.373
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY
THAT HAS ARISEN

11:36.410 --> 11:41.200
THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU
A STAGED READING

11:41.250 --> 11:43.764
AT THE BERKELEY
TH EATER COMPANY.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.836
- NO.
- YEP.

11:45.870 --> 11:47.110
- [chuckles]
OKAY.

11:47.150 --> 11:49.425
THAT'S REALLY COOL,
BUT IT'S NOT READY.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.769
I SHOULD WAIT UNTIL
IT'S IN BETTER SHAPE.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.846
- YOU COULD DO THESE CHANGES
IN THREE DAYS.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.849
- I COULD IF I DIDN'T
HAVE A FAMILY AND A JOB.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.360
AND IT'S CLOSE, BUT--
- YOU KNOW I CAN'T HELP

11:59.400 --> 12:01.129
BUT THINK
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

12:01.160 --> 12:03.367
IF YOU PUT ALL THAT
ENERGY YOU HAVE

12:03.410 --> 12:06.470
INTO THIS PLAY.

12:06.510 --> 12:08.330
SARAH...

12:08.380 --> 12:11.099
I HATE TO BE THE ONE
TO TELL YOU.

12:11.140 --> 12:14.200
YOU HAVE A GIFT.
YOU REALLY DO.

12:14.250 --> 12:17.413
THIS IS A GREAT PLAY.
THIS PLAY IS YOU.

12:17.460 --> 12:20.736
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE,
LET YOURSELF COME FIRST.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.778
[doorbell rings]

12:29.050 --> 12:30.290
- HEY.
- HEY.

12:30.330 --> 12:32.059
- YOUR DAD HOME?
- YEAH.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.118
- HEY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:38.170 --> 12:39.569
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?

12:39.620 --> 12:42.259
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
PROBABLY SICK OF ME SAYING IT,

12:42.310 --> 12:44.961
BUT I'M SO SORRY.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.888
AND I HATE
THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING.

12:46.930 --> 12:47.999
- OKAY.
IS THAT IT?

12:48.040 --> 12:50.247
YOU DONE?
- NO, UM...

12:50.280 --> 12:51.963
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT

12:52.010 --> 12:53.591
BUYING A HOUSE.
- GREAT.

12:53.630 --> 12:55.860
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
YOU WANT TO BORROW SOME MONEY?

12:55.910 --> 12:57.116
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.
SO YOU CAN GO.

12:57.150 --> 12:59.323
- NO, I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO BORROW MONEY.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.942
I KNOW YOU'RE PISSED
AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND,

13:01.980 --> 13:03.607
BUT YOU KNOW...

13:03.640 --> 13:04.948
NORMALLY,
YOU WOULD'VE SAID MAYBE,

13:04.990 --> 13:06.946
"THAT'S INTERESTING,
WHY NOW?

13:06.990 --> 13:09.015
YOU DON'T HAVE
A FIANCEE OR A SON ANYMORE."

13:09.060 --> 13:10.607
- MM-HMM.
- TO WHICH I WOULD REPLY,

13:10.650 --> 13:12.925
"THAT'S HOW I'M GONNA
WIN THEM BACK."

13:14.060 --> 13:16.062
- OKAY.
WELL, YOU REALLY ARE AN IDIOT.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.829
- YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA?

13:17.860 --> 13:19.589
- NO, I DON'T.
YOU'RE BEHAVING LIKE A CHILD.

13:19.620 --> 13:21.508
YOU CHEATED ON YOUR FIANCEE,
AND NOW YOU THINK THAT

13:21.550 --> 13:23.552
GOING AND BUYING A HOUSE
IS GONNA MAKE IT ALL BETTER?

13:23.590 --> 13:26.832
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY?
THAT'S YOUR PLAN?

13:26.870 --> 13:29.316
- ACTUALLY, YEAH, THAT'S
THE PLAN AS OF RIGHT NOW.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.839
- WELL, THAT'S
A STUPID PLAN, OKAY?

13:30.870 --> 13:31.802
AND IT'S
FURTHER PROOF TO ME

13:31.840 --> 13:33.569
THAT YOU ARE IMMATURE
AND IRRESPONSIBLE.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.908
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I SCREWED UP.

13:34.950 --> 13:35.769
I CHEATED ON MY FIANCEE

13:35.810 --> 13:37.254
AND I RUINED THINGS
HERE FOR YOU.

13:37.290 --> 13:38.496
- YOU SURE DID.
- AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

13:38.540 --> 13:40.053
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN EVERY SINGLE DECISION

13:40.090 --> 13:42.604
I MAKE NOW IS STUPID
OR IMMATURE, ALL RIGHT?

13:42.640 --> 13:43.743
HAVE YOU EVER NIOADE A MISTAKE?

13:43.780 --> 13:46.169
NO, I HAVEN'T, ACTUALLY.
I NEVER HAVE MADE A MISTAKE.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.883
NOT LIKE THAT,
OKAY?

13:47.930 --> 13:49.306
SO GO BUY YOUR HOUSE
AND MAKE YOUR LIFE ALL BETTER.

13:49.340 --> 13:51.308
- OKAY, I'LL BUY THE HOUSE.
- GOOD, GO BUY IT.

13:51.340 --> 13:52.546
- GREAT.
- OKAY.

13:52.590 --> 13:53.659
- FINE.
- LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.

13:53.690 --> 13:55.237
- YEAH.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.271
THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.999
- PERFECT.
- [glggleSJ

14:08.050 --> 14:09.938
- I WENT TO SCHOOL FOR IT.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.561
OH, HEY THERE,
TONYA HARDING.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.113
- I'M A REALLY GOOD SKATER.
- UH-HUH.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.184
- AM I NOT
A REALLY GOOD SKATER?

14:14.230 --> 14:15.913
- NO, YOU ARE
A GOOD SKATER.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.577
YOU ONLY FELL ONCE.
- I ONLY FELL ONCE!

14:17.610 --> 14:19.430
AND IT WASN'T EVEN
A BAD FALL.

14:19.470 --> 14:21.358
IT WAS JUST
SOME FREAK ACCIDENT.

14:21.410 --> 14:23.571
I GOTTA GET CHECKED OUT
FOR OSTEOPOROSIS.

14:23.620 --> 14:26.236
HEY, DID MY DAD CALL
ABOUT MY OLD GOLF CLUBS FOR SYD?

14:26.270 --> 14:27.589
- I HAVEN'T HEARD.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.589
- WELL, SYD, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
WE ARE DOING TODAY?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.895
- TODAY'S MY PLAYDATE
WITH CHLOE.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.079
- MAYBE JUST THIS ONCE
WE CAN RESCHEDULE CHLOE,

14:35.110 --> 14:37.692
BECAUSE I HAVE
SOMETHING SO SPECIAL

14:37.730 --> 14:38.799
PLANNED FOR YOU AND ME.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.183
- WELL, I THOUGHT
WE HAD SPECIAL TIME YESTERDAY.

14:41.220 --> 14:44.257
AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT.
- RIGHT.

14:44.290 --> 14:46.463
WELL, TODAY
WE'RE GOING TO THE ZOO

14:46.500 --> 14:48.604
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
BABY KOMODO DRAGONS.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.016
- COOL!

14:50.060 --> 14:51.573
- GET YOUR BAG, LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

14:53.470 --> 14:55.222
- [chuckles]

14:59.650 --> 15:01.333
- IT'S A FACT THAT THINGS
GET OUT OF CONTROL

15:01.380 --> 15:02.688
ON PROM NIGHT,
AND I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO

15:02.720 --> 15:04.540
REALLY TALK TO HER, THAT'S ALL.
- I DID TALK TO HER.

15:04.590 --> 15:05.727
WE WENT OVER THE RULES
FOR PROM NIGHT,

15:05.760 --> 15:07.443
AND HER CURFEW'S
GONNA BE AN HOUR LATER,

15:07.490 --> 15:09.071
WHICH IS TOTALLY FINE.
- HONEY--

15:09.110 --> 15:10.520
- IF SHE WANTS TO GO
TO AN AFTER-PARTY, LET HER.

15:10.560 --> 15:11.652
- "IF" SHE WANTS
TO GO TO AN AFTER-PARTY?

15:11.700 --> 15:12.667
HONEY, THAT'S BEING NAIVE.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.622
- IT'S NOT BEING NAIVE.
- IT IS BEING NAIVE.

15:14.670 --> 15:15.807
HONEY, OF COURSE SHE'S
GONNA GO TO AN AFTER-PARTY.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.422
- I LAID OUT THE RULES.
- I HAD SEX WITH MICHELLE MCCANN

15:18.460 --> 15:20.087
ON PROM NIGHT.
- I KNOW YOU DID, OKAY?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.189
- OKAY.

15:21.230 --> 15:22.015
- BUT I HATE TO POINT
IT OUT TO YOU.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.153
KIDS ARE GONNA HAVE SEX
NO MATTER

15:23.190 --> 15:24.009
IF IT'S PROM NIGHT OR NOT.

15:24.060 --> 15:25.709
- NO, NO, NO, HONEY.
- YES, THEY ARE.

15:25.750 --> 15:26.819
- IT'S DIFFERENT. NO, IT'S NOT.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.260
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I REMEMBER
ABOUT MY PROM NIGHT?

15:28.300 --> 15:29.710
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.194
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.719
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HER DRESS LOOKED LIKE.

15:32.750 --> 15:34.331
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT COLOR IT WAS.

15:34.380 --> 15:36.029
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HER PARENTS LOOKED LIKE.

15:36.070 --> 15:37.992
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHERE I PUT THE CORSAGE.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.758
- OH, MY GOD, OKAY.
- HONEY, I WAS LIKE A ZOMBIE

15:39.800 --> 15:41.131
WITH ONE DIRECT IVE--

15:41.180 --> 15:42.624
TO GET
MICHELLE MCCANN'S DRESS OFF.

15:42.660 --> 15:44.969
- GREAT.
- I DO REMEMBER ONE THING.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.454
SHE HAD A DRESS
WITH A SLIT UP TO HERE.

15:46.490 --> 15:47.593
- I KNOW, I REMEMBER.
- UP TO HERE, HONEY.

15:47.630 --> 15:48.733
- I SAW THE PICTURES, I KNOW.

15:48.770 --> 15:50.351
- I'M DOWN ON MY KNEES,
TAKING OFF HER GARTER BELT.

15:50.390 --> 15:51.664
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS
RIGHT NOW.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.735
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

15:52.770 --> 15:54.522
STOP.
- I WANT TO MAKE A POINT.

15:54.570 --> 15:55.776
I WANT YOU TO
REALLY TALK TO OUR DAUGHTER.

15:55.810 --> 15:57.220
- HADDIE
IS NOT MICHELLE MCCANN,

15:57.260 --> 15:59.057
AND I WILL TALK TO HER.

15:59.090 --> 16:02.674
- THANK YOU.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.267
[footsteps approaching]

16:04.300 --> 16:05.403
- HEY.
- HI.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.748
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

16:06.790 --> 16:08.678
- AH.
I WOULD LOVE TO

16:08.720 --> 16:10.585
BUT I'M WORKING,

16:10.620 --> 16:14.101
AND I'VE BEEN INSTRUCTED
TO PUT MYSELF FIRST.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.586
- OKAY, COULD YOU
PUT YOURSELF FIRST

16:16.630 --> 16:18.621
IN, LIKE, TWO MINUTES
AFTER WE TALK?

16:18.660 --> 16:21.720
I TRIED TO TALK TO ADAM,
BUT HE HATES MY GUTS.

16:21.770 --> 16:23.317
- SORRY, CROS.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.624
YOU DID SLEEP WITH
HIS CHILD'S BEHAVIORAL AIDE.

16:25.670 --> 16:27.661
- YEAH, IT SOUNDS SO SCANDALOUS
THE WAY YOU SAY IT.

16:27.710 --> 16:29.018
- NO, I KNOW.
IT'S DEFINITELY

16:29.050 --> 16:30.802
THE WAY IT SOUNDS
THAT WAS SCAN DALOUS

16:30.850 --> 16:32.158
'CAUSE DOING IT,
NO BIG DEAL.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.704
- SARAH, I'M NOT DENYING
WHAT A JERK I AM.

16:34.750 --> 16:37.298
I TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

16:37.340 --> 16:39.808
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
YOU'D LIKE ME TO SAY.

16:39.860 --> 16:43.023
- I'M SORRY.
IT JUST PISSES ME OFF.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.709
- WELL, I--

16:45.760 --> 16:47.751
I CAME OVER BECAUSE

16:47.790 --> 16:48.893
I'M GONNA
SELL THE HOUSEBOAT,

16:48.930 --> 16:51.581
AND I'M GONNA USE THAT MONEY
TO PUT A DOWN PAYMENT

16:51.630 --> 16:53.621
ON A HOUSE
IN HOPES THAT

16:53.660 --> 16:55.764
JASMINE WILL WANT TO
COME LIVE IN IT WITH ME.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.620
- WHAT?

16:57.670 --> 17:00.662
YOU'RE GONNA BUY A HOUSE
SHE'S NEVER SEEN

17:00.700 --> 17:02.520
TO TRY TO WIN HER BACK?
- LOOK, I DON'T--

17:02.570 --> 17:03.776
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO DO.

17:03.810 --> 17:04.629
I WOULD DO ANYTHING.

17:04.670 --> 17:06.490
IF I THOUGHT
SHE WANTED AN AIRPLANE,

17:06.540 --> 17:08.360
I WOULD FIGURE OUT
HOW TO GET HER AN AIRPLANE.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.641
SO I THOUGHT
MAYBE YOU COULD COME BY

17:10.680 --> 17:12.819
AND GIVE ME, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
A FEMALE'S PERSPECTIVE

17:12.850 --> 17:15.569
ON WHETHER SHE'LL THINK
IT'S CUTE OR NICE,

17:15.620 --> 17:17.576
AND YOU KNOW,
IF SHE WOULD LIKE IT.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.759
- I'VE NEVER BOUGHT A HOUSE,

17:19.790 --> 17:21.678
BUT I AM A FEMALE.

17:21.730 --> 17:23.721
SO YES, I CAN DO THAT.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.375
- THANK YOU.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.796
- I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'LL WORK, BUT IT'S--

17:26.830 --> 17:29.105
IT'S A GRAND GESTURE.

17:29.150 --> 17:31.175
- IT'LL BE GREAT TOO
IF MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

17:31.220 --> 17:33.381
JULIA AND JOEL--
- YEAH, AND ADAM.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.289
- I DON'T THINK
ADAM'S EVER GONNA COME OVER.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.121
- WELL, I'LL BE THERE.

17:51.510 --> 17:54.399
- HEY, HONEY, I THINK WE SHOULD
TRY ON THE GREEN ONE FIRST.

17:54.450 --> 17:55.678
- I'M TRYING
ON THE PURPLE ONE.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.449
- FOUND A LITTLE BLUE ONE
THAT MIGHT WORK.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.515
- OKAY.
- IT'S A LOT SHORTER,

17:59.560 --> 18:01.175
BUT IT'S STILL
KINDA CUTE AND FLIRTY.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.178
IT'S A LITTLE SHORT,
THOUGH.

18:03.220 --> 18:05.768
HEY, HONEY, DID YOU GUYS
TALK ABOUT YOUR PLANS

18:05.800 --> 18:07.688
FOR AFTER PROM?

18:07.740 --> 18:09.492
- NO, I SAID
I WOULD CALL YOU, RIGHT?

18:09.530 --> 18:10.906
- I KNOW, BUT I JUST--
I NEED TO KNOW

18:10.950 --> 18:12.497
IF ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS
ARE GETTING HOTEL ROOMS,

18:12.530 --> 18:13.918
SO I KNOW WHERE TO
PICK YOU UP.

18:13.950 --> 18:15.702
- MOM, NO,
THEY'RE NOT, OKAY?

18:15.740 --> 18:17.742
- [gasp5]

18:17.780 --> 18:19.429
HONEY, YOU LOOK STUNNING.

18:19.470 --> 18:20.880
- NO.
- IT IS SO PRETTY.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.330
- I LOOK LIKE--
- I DIDN'T THINK THE PURPLE

18:22.370 --> 18:23.746
WOULD WORK,
BUT IT WORKS WITH THE JEWELS,

18:23.790 --> 18:25.439
AND IT'S LIKE
A YOUNG ELIZABETH TAYLOR.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.788
- NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T LIKE IT.

18:26.820 --> 18:29.892
- ARE YOU AND ALEX
TALKING ABOUT SEX?

18:30.970 --> 18:32.301
I JUST HAD TO ASK.

18:32.350 --> 18:34.489
- NO, MOM.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.726
- OKAY.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.830
OKAY, I JUST WONDERED.

18:37.870 --> 18:40.794

18:40.840 --> 18:42.182
- I AGREE.
HONEY, AS A MOM, I JUST

18:42.220 --> 18:43.767
HAVE TO ASK THESE

18:47.190 --> 18:50.421
I MEAN, I'M NOT KIDDING.
YOU LOOK STUNNING.

18:50.470 --> 18:51.630

19:17.390 --> 19:20.325
- MEDIOCRE PIZZA

19:20.360 --> 19:22.419
- OOH, CHINESE, 'CAUSE
IT'S THE TONGUE TWISTER.

19:22.470 --> 19:23.607
- [chuckles]

19:23.640 --> 19:24.914
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

19:24.950 --> 19:27.430

19:38.450 --> 19:40.680
- YOU'RE KIDDING!
- I'M NOT KIDDING.

19:40.730 --> 19:42.937
I CAN EXPLAIN,
SO IF YOU'LL HOLD

19:42.970 --> 19:45.245
YOUR HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER
UNTIL THE END.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.862
HADDIE AND HER BOYFRIEND ARE,
LIKE, BEGGING ME TO GO,

19:47.910 --> 19:51.619
AND SO I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE FUNNY TO GO.

19:51.670 --> 19:53.945
AND YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.
- WHO IS YOUR DATE?

19:53.980 --> 19:55.971
- I DON'T KNOW.
SOME GUY THAT ALEX KNOWS

19:56.020 --> 19:57.840
FROM THE COMMUNITY CENTER.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.871
- YOU'RE GOING TO PROM
ON A BLIND DATE!

19:59.920 --> 20:02.741
IT'S, LIKE, 1954.

20:10.930 --> 20:14.275
BUT IT'S A STORY
YOU'LL ALWAYS TELL.

20:14.310 --> 20:17.655
IT'S AN EXPERIENCE
YOU WON'T BE SORRY YOU HAD

20:17.690 --> 20:18.964
NO MATTER
IF IT'S GOOD OR BAD.

20:19.010 --> 20:22.832
AND IT'S JUST
A BEAUTIFUL, SENTIMENTAL WAY

20:22.870 --> 20:23.859
TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO HIGH SCHOOL

20:23.910 --> 20:25.662

20:53.590 --> 20:55.865
AND I'D KEEP THE MUSIC DOWN,

20:55.900 --> 20:57.936

OKAY, HERE ARE THE KEYS.

21:50.170 --> 21:52.377
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
THAT'S THE LAST THING I AM.

21:52.410 --> 21:53.718
I'M A PERSON WHO'S A MOM

21:53.760 --> 21:55.091
WHO'S TRYING

22:17.160 --> 22:18.912
I'M KILLING MYSELF
OVER THIS THING.

22:18.950 --> 22:20.463
I'VE NEVER WORKED SO HARD.
- [chuckles]

22:20.510 --> 22:22.057

22:28.550 --> 22:29.926
YOU DON'T

DID YOU TALK TO CROSBY,
BY THE WAY?

22:53.640 --> 22:55.016

34:40.140 --> 34:41.550
- WAS EVERYTHING
OKAY WITH THE DATE?

34:41.590 --> 34:43.694
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

34:43.730 --> 34:46.767
IT WAS FINE.
IT'S JUST...

34:46.800 --> 34:49.246
THIS WHOLE...

34:49.290 --> 34:51.281
THIS WHOLE THING
IS NOT WORKING.

34:51.330 --> 34:54.629
LIKE...
YOU KNOW,

34:54.670 --> 34:57.605
GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL
AND BEING A GREAT STUDENT

34:57.640 --> 35:00.268
AND GOING TO PROM
AND HAVING A NICE DATE

35:00.300 --> 35:01.153
AND GOING TO COLLEGE.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.122
LIKE, THAT'S JUST NOT
WORKING FOR ME.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.398
- OH, HONEY,
YOU'RE SO SMART.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.647
IT'S GONNA LOOK
DIFFERENT TOMORROW, YOU KNOW?

35:06.690 --> 35:08.612
IT'S JUST GONNA FEEL--
- MOM, CAN YOU JUST LISTEN!

35:08.650 --> 35:11.517
REALLY LISTEN TO WHAT
I'M SAYING, PLEASE!

35:11.550 --> 35:14.792
I AM TRYING TO COMMUNICATE
WITH YOU HONESTLY HERE, OKAY?

35:14.830 --> 35:19.244
I DID THE BEST I COULD
TO DO WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.

35:19.280 --> 35:22.283
I DID THE BEST THAT
I COULD TO BE GOOD IN SCHOOL,

35:22.320 --> 35:26.427
TO GO TO COLLEGE AND TAKE
PART IN THIS HIGH SCHOOL LIFE.

35:26.460 --> 35:27.939
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING
FOR ME.

35:27.980 --> 35:30.289
SO I'M SORRY,
BUT I NEED TO START DOING

35:30.330 --> 35:33.367
WHAT FEELS GOOD FOR ME
AND TRYING TO SEE IF THAT WORKS.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.958
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE THING

35:34.990 --> 35:36.742
OF DOING WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO DO

35:36.780 --> 35:38.224
AND WHAT YOU SUGGEST ME TO DO

35:38.270 --> 35:39.544
AND YOU TRYING
TO FIX MY PROBLEMS,

35:39.580 --> 35:40.740
IT'S NOT WORKING.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.712
IT'S NOT YOUR LIFE.
IT'S MY LIFE.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.546
AND I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND
THAT I'M GONNA START

35:44.590 --> 35:47.275
MAKING MY OWN DECISIONS,
WHETHER YOU LIKE THEM OR NOT.

35:47.310 --> 35:48.550
AND THAT HAS
TO BE OKAY WITH YOU,

35:48.590 --> 35:50.865
BECAUSE IT'S WHO I AM.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.481
OKAY?

36:12.270 --> 36:15.683
- ALEX.
- YES?

36:15.720 --> 36:18.757
- REMEMBER WHEN
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT,

36:18.790 --> 36:22.203
LIKE, TIME?

36:22.240 --> 36:25.346
- YEAH?
- AND, LIKE, UM...

36:25.390 --> 36:30.453
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, THEN--
THAT WE'LL KNOW.

36:30.490 --> 36:33.288
- YEAH?

36:33.320 --> 36:39.805
- I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW
IS THE RIGHT TIME.

36:39.850 --> 36:41.704
- HADDIE, I DON'T
WANT YOU TO FEEL PRESSURE

36:41.750 --> 36:43.365
JUST BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, IT'S PROM NIGHT

36:43.400 --> 36:45.027
AND YOUR FRIENDS GOT ROOMS.

36:45.060 --> 36:46.027
- NO, I DON'T.

36:46.060 --> 36:48.927
I FEEL--I FEEL LIKE
THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME.

36:48.960 --> 36:52.782
I FEEL GOOD.

36:52.830 --> 36:55.515
- I FEEL GOOD.
- OKAY.

36:55.550 --> 36:58.553
- MM-HMM.

37:21.890 --> 37:23.778
- HONEY, I'M REALLY
STARTING TO WORRY.

37:23.820 --> 37:25.469
- WHY?
- BECAUSE SHE--

37:25.510 --> 37:27.307
LOOK, IT'S FOUR MINUTES
UNTIL CURFEW.

37:27.340 --> 37:29.479
- SHE HAS FOUR MINUTES.
- I'M GONNA GIVE HER A CALL.

37:29.520 --> 37:30.475
JUST GONNA MAKE SURE SHE'S--
- HONEY.

37:30.520 --> 37:31.964
- WHAT?
- STOP PANICKING.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.627
- I'M NOT PANICKING.
- YOU ARE PANICKING.

37:33.660 --> 37:35.582
- I'M NOT.
- YES, YOU ARE.

37:35.630 --> 37:37.416
[door opens]

37:37.460 --> 37:39.621
- AH.

37:39.670 --> 37:42.662
- SEE?

37:48.640 --> 37:50.847
HEY.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.086
- HEY.

37:52.130 --> 37:54.598
- HOW'D IT GO?

37:54.650 --> 37:55.742
- YEAH.

37:55.790 --> 37:57.929
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.611
JENNA WAS PROM QUEEN

38:00.650 --> 38:03.517
AND THE DECORATIONS
LOOKED REALLY NICE, SO...

38:04.590 --> 38:06.444
YEAH, I'M GONNA GO TO BED.
- GREAT.

38:06.490 --> 38:08.105
- I'M TIRED.
- OKAY.

38:08.140 --> 38:09.516
- YOU CAN SLEEP IN
TOMORROW IF YOU WANT.

38:09.560 --> 38:12.347
- HEY, THANK YOU
FOR MAKING CURFEW.

38:12.390 --> 38:14.836
- UM...THANKS FOR
THE DRESS.

38:14.870 --> 38:17.316
both: YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.319
- FEEL BETTER?

38:25.370 --> 38:26.576
- YES.
YES, I DO.

38:28.720 --> 38:31.678
SHE'S A GOOD GIRL.
- YES, SHE IS.

38:57.470 --> 39:00.439
- FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH...

39:00.470 --> 39:04.531
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO PLAY GOLF WITH YOU.

39:04.580 --> 39:05.808
- [sighs]

39:05.860 --> 39:09.569
- SOMEONE

39:09.620 --> 39:11.588
- [crying]

39:11.620 --> 39:15.579
- REACHING FOR ME NOW

39:15.620 --> 39:18.862
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

39:20.560 --> 39:26.692
- THROUGH THE DARK

39:26.740 --> 39:29.732
REACHING FOR ME NOW

39:36.440 --> 39:39.477
YOU NEED

39:39.510 --> 39:41.717
SOMEONE

39:41.750 --> 39:45.470
TO HEAR YOU WHEN YOU SIGH

39:45.520 --> 39:46.828
[door closes]

39:51.630 --> 39:55.452
SOMEONE

39:55.490 --> 40:00.666
TO WIPE AWAY THOSE TEARS
YOU CRY

40:06.880 --> 40:09.121
- WOW, SOMEBODY
REALLY LIKED CATS.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.775
- MOLDY, EVEN.

40:10.820 --> 40:12.708
CLEARLY, THE WINDOWS
HAVE TO COME OUT.

40:12.750 --> 40:13.842
- YEAH.

40:13.890 --> 40:15.505
- THAT'S NOT TOO HARD,
THOUGH, IS IT?

40:15.550 --> 40:17.711
- NO, I MEAN,
IT'S NOT TOO HARD,

40:17.760 --> 40:20.923
BUT WHEN YOU ADD THAT
TO THE KITCHEN CABINETS

40:20.970 --> 40:24.098
AND THE TILES AND
THE AROMA OF ALLEGED HOMICIDE,

40:24.140 --> 40:26.108
IT'S NOT NOTHING, MAN.
- ALL RIGHT.

40:26.140 --> 40:27.448
- CROS,
HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT

40:27.490 --> 40:29.071
THIS LITTLE HOUSE
ACROSS THE STREET?

40:29.110 --> 40:30.691
IT'S REALLY CUTE.
- YEAH.

40:30.730 --> 40:32.732
OBVIOUSLY, IF I COULD
AFFORD THE PERFECT HOUSE

40:32.770 --> 40:34.499
ACROSS THE STREET,
I WOULD'VE GOT THAT ONE.

40:34.530 --> 40:36.737
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.738
- CROS, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS SAYING AT ALL.

40:38.780 --> 40:41.669
THIS IS A REALLY SWEET IDEA.
- SUCH A NICE IDEA.

40:41.710 --> 40:42.984
- IT'S JUST
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY

40:43.020 --> 40:44.988
AND A LOT
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

40:45.020 --> 40:47.056
- WELL, I ALREADY
BOUGHT THIS HOUSE, SO...

40:50.620 --> 40:53.578
- THIS ONE?

40:53.620 --> 40:55.099
- OH.

40:55.140 --> 40:57.791
OH, MY GOD.

40:57.830 --> 41:02.073
OH, MY GOD, I DO NOT
KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING.

41:02.110 --> 41:04.590
I MEAN, ACTUALLY I DO.
I WAS THINKING,

41:04.630 --> 41:06.109
"YOU KNOW,
I ALREADY WRECKED MY LIFE,

41:06.150 --> 41:08.072
"SO I DON'T REALLY CARE
IF I WRECK IT WORSE

41:08.120 --> 41:11.704
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY
WRECK IT WORSE THAN TOTALLY."

41:11.740 --> 41:13.708
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- THERE'S CONTINGENCIES HERE.

41:13.740 --> 41:15.492
- YEAH, THE INSPECTION
MIGHT NOT GO THROUGH.

41:15.540 --> 41:16.393
- NOT A CHANCE.
- YEAH.

41:16.430 --> 41:18.603
YOU CAN WIGGLE
OUT OF IT DURING ESCROW.

41:18.640 --> 41:21.814
- YEAH, WELL, I ALREADY
SOLD THE HOUSE BOAT.

41:23.750 --> 41:24.956
- HE DID.

41:24.990 --> 41:26.685
- WOW.

41:26.720 --> 41:30.781
- IT SEEMED LIKE A GROWN-UP
THING TO DO AT THE TIME.

41:30.830 --> 41:32.923
- WELL, IT WAS.

41:32.970 --> 41:34.938
I MEAN, WHAT KIND
OF A GROWN-UP GUY

41:34.970 --> 41:38.861
LIVES ON A HOUSE BOAT?

41:38.910 --> 41:41.902
- THANKS FOR COMING.

41:43.700 --> 41:46.214
- I MEAN, NOT THAT
THIS PLACE ISN'T A DUMP.

41:46.260 --> 41:47.943
- AWFUL.
- [chuckles]

41:47.980 --> 41:51.154
- [laughing]

41:51.190 --> 41:52.987
YOU THINK I CAN FIX IT?

41:54.990 --> 41:57.299
- NO.
- OKAY. GREAT.

41:57.340 --> 42:00.503
- I THINK WE CAN FIX IT.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.652
- SORRY.

42:11.800 --> 42:12.937
- YEAH, YEAH.

42:12.970 --> 42:14.176
- I BOUGHT A BAD HOUSE.

42:14.220 --> 42:17.007
[indistinct chatter]
