05:04.596 --> 05:08.475
And you shall never see
the light of another day.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.727
Adieu.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.523
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food?

05:15.107 --> 05:16.441
What do you want?

05:16.525 --> 05:19.903
I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way,

05:19.987 --> 05:23.574
so you'd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning's ceremony.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.284
Oh, look, Zazu.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.618
You've made me lose my lunch.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.621
You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

05:29.705 --> 05:32.374
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.919
I quiver with fear!

05:36.003 --> 05:38.547
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

05:38.881 --> 05:39.923
Help!

05:40.257 --> 05:42.217
Scar?

05:42.426 --> 05:43.468
Drop him.

05:43.552 --> 05:46.805
Impeccable timing, Your Majesty.

05:49.933 --> 05:54.021
Why, if it isn't my big brother
descending from on high

05:54.104 --> 05:56.148
to mingle with the commoners.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.359
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.570
That was today?

06:02.070 --> 06:03.989
I feel simply awful!

06:05.949 --> 06:07.951
Must've slipped my mind.

06:08.076 --> 06:11.246
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,

06:11.371 --> 06:14.249
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line!

06:15.501 --> 06:19.296
Well, I was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.

06:19.379 --> 06:24.384
That hairball is my son
and your future king.

06:24.468 --> 06:27.137
I shall practise my curtsy!

06:27.513 --> 06:29.806
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.225
Oh, no, Mufasa.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.144
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.147
Is that a challenge?

06:37.356 --> 06:38.732
Temper, temper.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.985
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.987
Pity. Why not?

06:44.071 --> 06:47.407
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

06:47.491 --> 06:50.827
But when it comes to brute strength,

06:50.911 --> 06:55.082
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.462
There's one in every family, sire.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.089
Two in mine, actually,

07:02.589 --> 07:05.300
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.344
What am I going to do with him?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.179
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.347
Zazu!

07:10.430 --> 07:12.850
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,

07:12.933 --> 07:15.018
you could take him out and beat him.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.232
Simba.

08:15.871 --> 08:17.080
Dad! Dad!

08:17.164 --> 08:19.583
Come on, dad, we gotta go! Wake up!

08:20.292 --> 08:21.919
Sorry.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.380
Dad! Dad!

08:25.464 --> 08:28.342
Your son is awake.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.470
Before sunrise, he's your son.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.679
Dad! Come on, Dad.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.102
You promised.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.813
Okay, Okay. I'm up, I'm up.

08:42.940 --> 08:43.982
Yeah!

09:00.290 --> 09:01.333
Look, Simba.

09:01.959 --> 09:05.546
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

09:07.464 --> 09:12.344
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.

09:12.469 --> 09:16.390
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here

09:16.473 --> 09:19.893
and will rise with you as the new king.

09:19.977 --> 09:22.688
- And this'll all be mine?
- Everything.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.649
Everything the light touches.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.901
What about that shadowy place?

09:28.151 --> 09:30.112
That's beyond our borders.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.572
You must never go there, Simba.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.740
But I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

09:33.824 --> 09:37.160
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.580
- There's more?
- Simba...

09:43.333 --> 09:47.754
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.757
As king, you need to
understand that balance

09:50.841 --> 09:52.593
and respect all the creatures,

09:52.676 --> 09:55.512
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.431
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

09:57.514 --> 10:00.100
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

10:00.309 --> 10:03.145
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

10:03.437 --> 10:05.898
and the antelope eat the grass.

10:05.981 --> 10:11.236
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.572
- Good morning, sire!
- Good morning, Zazu.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.490
Checking in with the morning report.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.658
Fire away.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.410
Well! The buzz from the bees

10:18.493 --> 10:20.412
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.580
Really?

10:22.497 --> 10:23.999
What are you doing, son?

10:24.583 --> 10:25.584
Pouncing.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.003
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.089
I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't...

10:31.173 --> 10:32.925
- Zazu, would you turn around?
- Yes, sire.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.092
The cheetahs are hard up, but...

10:34.176 --> 10:35.844
Stay low to the ground.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.262
Cheetahs never prosper...

10:37.346 --> 10:39.431
Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.

10:39.515 --> 10:40.682
- What going on?
- A pouncing lesson.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.018
Very good. Pouncing.

10:43.101 --> 10:46.522
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...

10:47.523 --> 10:49.274
This is so humiliating.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.943
Try not to make a sound.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.320
What are you telling him, Mufasa?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.657
Mufasa? Simba?

11:00.536 --> 11:01.703
That's very good.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.622
- Zazu!
- Yes!

11:03.705 --> 11:06.375
- News from the underground.
- Now, this time...

11:06.458 --> 11:09.711
Sire! Hyenas in the Pride Lands!

11:09.837 --> 11:11.296
Zazu, take Simba home.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.548
Aw, dad, can't I come?

11:12.631 --> 11:13.715
No, son.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.969
Pah! I never get to go anywhere.

11:17.052 --> 11:21.139
Oh, young master,
one day, <i>you will be king</i>.

11:21.223 --> 11:25.143
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers

11:25.227 --> 11:27.229
from dawn until dusk.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.655
Hey, Uncle Scar! Guess what?

11:36.738 --> 11:39.825
I despise guessing games.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.994
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.329
Oh, goody!

11:44.413 --> 11:46.164
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

11:46.248 --> 11:49.251
and I'm gonna rule it all!

11:49.376 --> 11:52.838
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping forjoy.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.257
Bad back, you know.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.426
Hey, Uncle Scar.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.845
When I'm king, what'll that make you?

11:59.928 --> 12:02.181
A monkey's uncle.

12:02.264 --> 12:06.101
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.

12:06.185 --> 12:09.354
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

12:09.438 --> 12:10.522
Everything.

12:10.606 --> 12:14.193
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

12:14.568 --> 12:17.696
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.781
And he's absolutely right.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.200
It's far too dangerous.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.702
Only the bravest lions go there.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.455
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

12:26.580 --> 12:28.957
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.125
Why not?

12:30.209 --> 12:34.630
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favourite nephew.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.549
Yeah, right! I'm your <i>only nephew</i>.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.135
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

12:40.427 --> 12:44.473
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops!

12:44.765 --> 12:47.142
An elephant what?

12:47.309 --> 12:50.395
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

12:50.479 --> 12:53.315
Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

12:53.482 --> 12:56.401
you being so clever and all.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.153
Just do me one favour.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.824
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.326
No problem.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.078
There's a good lad.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.914
You run along now and have fun.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.499
And remember,

13:10.582 --> 13:13.085
it's our little secret.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.177
- Hey, Nala.
- Hi, Simba.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.429
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.

13:24.513 --> 13:27.015
Simba! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.184
And it's time for yours.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.271
Mom!

13:32.354 --> 13:35.274
Mom, you're messing up my mane!

13:36.608 --> 13:39.111
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?

13:39.194 --> 13:40.529
So, where are we going?

13:40.612 --> 13:42.114
It better not be anyplace dumb.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.032
No, it's really cool.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.618
So, where is this really cool place?

13:46.702 --> 13:48.120
Oh.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.873
- Around the water hole.
- The water hole?

13:50.998 --> 13:52.791
What's so great about the water hole?

13:52.875 --> 13:55.043
I'll show you when we get there.

13:55.127 --> 13:56.295
Oh.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.213
Mom, can I go with Simba?

13:58.630 --> 14:00.549
What do you think, Sarabi?

14:00.632 --> 14:01.675
Well...

14:01.884 --> 14:03.135
Please?

14:03.218 --> 14:04.386
It's all right with me.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.554
- Yeah!
- All right!

14:05.637 --> 14:07.556
As long as Zazu goes with you.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.224
No, not Zazu.

14:09.808 --> 14:10.809
Step lively.

14:10.893 --> 14:14.897
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.857
So, where are we really going?

14:16.982 --> 14:18.317
An elephant graveyard.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.986
Zazu.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.822
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

14:24.656 --> 14:26.742
Oh, just look at you two.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.912
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.247
Your parents will be thrilled,

14:32.372 --> 14:34.666
what with your being betrothed and all.

14:34.750 --> 14:35.834
Be-what?

14:35.918 --> 14:37.586
Betrothed. Intended.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.588
Affianced.

14:39.713 --> 14:40.756
Meaning...

14:40.923 --> 14:43.842
One day, you two are
going to be married.

14:43.926 --> 14:44.927
- Yuck!
- Eww!

14:45.052 --> 14:47.221
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.515
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.558
Sorry to bust your bubble,

14:51.642 --> 14:54.228
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.772
It's a tradition going back generations.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.399
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

14:59.483 --> 15:02.319
- Not so long as I'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.821
Nice try, but only the king can do that.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.490
Well, he's the future king.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.951
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.494
Not yet, I don't.

15:10.619 --> 15:12.037
And with an attitude like that,

15:12.120 --> 15:15.916
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.626
Not the way I see it.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.754
♪ I'm gonna be a mighty king

15:20.838 --> 15:22.923
♪ So enemies beware

15:23.006 --> 15:25.592
♪ Well, I've never seen
♪ a king of beasts

15:25.676 --> 15:27.845
♪ With quite so little hair

What do you think, Ed?

19:34.132 --> 19:35.884
Just what I was thinking.

19:36.426 --> 19:37.970
A trio of trespassers!

19:38.053 --> 19:40.264
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

19:40.389 --> 19:42.182
A simple navigational error.

19:42.266 --> 19:44.226
Wait, wait, wait.

19:44.309 --> 19:48.313
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

19:53.819 --> 19:57.447
Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?

19:57.656 --> 20:00.242
You can't do anything to me.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.578
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.

20:02.661 --> 20:06.874

slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

20:30.814 --> 20:31.857
No, why?

20:31.982 --> 20:34.109
'Cause there it goes!

20:40.324 --> 20:43.035
- Did we lose 'em?

20:58.842 --> 21:01.136
- Like you?
- Oops.

Boo!

22:01.071 --> 22:03.532
- Oh, please, please! Uncle, uncle!
- Silence!

22:03.615 --> 22:06.827
- We're gonna shut up right now!
- Calm down. We're really sorry.

22:06.910 --> 22:10.038

22:10.289 --> 22:11.790
Oh, this is... This is <i>your son</i> ?

22:11.874 --> 22:14.376
- Oh, <i>your son</i>.
- Did you know that?

22:14.459 --> 22:16.879
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?

22:16.962 --> 22:18.881
- No, of course not.
- No.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.048
Ed?

22:23.385 --> 22:24.720
Toodles.

22:31.977 --> 22:34.730
- Dad, I...
- You deliberately disobeyed me.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.984
- Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
- Let's go home.

22:42.070 --> 22:44.615
I thought you were very brave.

23:01.340 --> 23:02.841
Zazu.

23:04.927 --> 23:06.094
Yes, sire?

23:06.178 --> 23:10.474
Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.605
Come, Nala.

23:16.688 --> 23:20.108
Simba, good luck.

23:25.781 --> 23:27.783
Simba!

23:55.394 --> 23:57.312
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.

23:57.396 --> 23:59.815
- I know.
- You could've been killed.

23:59.898 --> 24:01.859
You deliberately disobeyed me,

24:01.984 --> 24:05.696
and what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

24:06.196 --> 24:08.365
I was just trying to be brave, like you.

24:08.824 --> 24:11.827
I'm only brave when I have to be.

24:11.910 --> 24:15.539
Simba, being brave

24:15.622 --> 24:17.958
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.085
But you're not scared of anything.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.379
I was today.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.631
- You were?
- Yes.

24:24.756 --> 24:26.842
I thought I might lose you.

24:26.925 --> 24:30.929
I guess even kings get scared?

24:32.264 --> 24:34.516
- But you know what?
- What?

24:34.600 --> 24:37.144
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

24:38.770 --> 24:41.899
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.

24:41.982 --> 24:44.443
- Come here, you.
- Oh, no! No!

24:47.529 --> 24:49.156
Come here!

24:50.532 --> 24:51.700
Gotcha!

24:56.955 --> 24:58.498
Dad?

24:58.624 --> 25:01.335
- We're pals, right?
- Right.

25:01.460 --> 25:04.171
And we'll always be together, right?

25:05.464 --> 25:11.178
Simba, let me tell you something
that my father told me.

25:11.303 --> 25:13.180
Look at the stars.

25:13.555 --> 25:18.352
The great kings of the past
look down on us from those stars.

25:18.810 --> 25:20.729
- Really?
- Yes.

25:20.812 --> 25:23.106
So whenever you feel alone,

25:23.190 --> 25:27.945
just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you.

25:29.404 --> 25:31.281
And so will I.

25:38.038 --> 25:41.667
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.505
It's not funny, Ed.

25:50.342 --> 25:52.511
Hey, shut up!

25:55.347 --> 25:56.974
Will you knock it off?

25:58.183 --> 26:01.186
- Well, he started it.
- Look at you guys.

26:01.436 --> 26:03.856
No wonder we're dangling
at the bottom of the food chain.

26:03.981 --> 26:05.440
Man, I hate dangling.

26:05.524 --> 26:09.361
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions,
we'd be runnin' the joint.

26:09.486 --> 26:10.863
Man, I hate lions.

26:10.988 --> 26:12.614
- So pushy.
- And hairy.

26:12.698 --> 26:14.783
- And stinky.
- And, man, are they...

26:14.867 --> 26:16.869
Ugly!

26:18.287 --> 26:22.040
Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad.

26:22.416 --> 26:24.960
- Oh.
- Oh, Scar. It's just you.

26:25.043 --> 26:27.129
We were afraid it was
somebody important.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.630
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

26:28.714 --> 26:30.257
- Yeah.
- I see.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.634
- Now that's power!
- Tell me about it.

26:32.718 --> 26:34.469
I just hear that name and I shudder.

26:34.553 --> 26:37.139
- Mufasa!
- Do it again.

26:37.222 --> 26:38.557
- Mufasa!
- Ooooh!

26:38.682 --> 26:41.226
Mufasa! Mufasa! Mufasa!

26:41.935 --> 26:43.103
It tingles me.

26:43.187 --> 26:46.064
I'm surrounded by idiots.

26:46.148 --> 26:49.234
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're
one of us. I mean, you're our pal.

26:49.359 --> 26:50.485
Charmed.

26:50.569 --> 26:54.698
Oh, I like that. He's not king,
but he's still so proper.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.658

bring us anything to eat,

27:04.541 --> 27:07.920

30:30.289 --> 30:34.751
You wait here. Your father has
a marvellous surprise for you.

30:34.835 --> 30:36.086
What is it?

30:36.170 --> 30:39.381
If I told you, it wouldn't be
a surprise now, would it?

30:39.506 --> 30:41.466
If you tell me,
I'll still act surprised.

30:41.842 --> 30:45.429
Ho ho ho! You are such a naughty boy.

30:45.512 --> 30:48.640
- Come on, Uncle Scar.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:48.724 --> 30:51.059
This is just for you and your daddy.

30:51.185 --> 30:55.814
You know, a sort of father-son thing.

30:55.898 --> 30:58.692
Well, I'd better go get him.

30:58.817 --> 31:00.611
- I'll go with you.
- No.

31:02.070 --> 31:05.824
No. Just stay on this rock.

31:05.908 --> 31:07.910
You wouldn't want to end up
in another mess

31:08.035 --> 31:09.703
like you did with the hyenas.

31:09.870 --> 31:13.707
- You know about that?
- Simba, everybody knows about that.

31:13.790 --> 31:16.376
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

31:16.460 --> 31:20.172
Lucky daddy was there
to save you, eh?

31:20.255 --> 31:22.966
Oh, and just between us,

31:23.050 --> 31:26.428
you might want to work on
that little roar of yours?

31:26.803 --> 31:28.430
Oh. Okay.

31:31.099 --> 31:34.728
Hey, Uncle Scar,
will I like this surprise?

31:35.103 --> 31:39.107
Simba, it's to die for.

32:00.379 --> 32:01.797
Shut up.

32:01.922 --> 32:05.300
I can't help it. I'm so hungry.
I got to have a wildebeest.

32:05.425 --> 32:06.802
Stay put.

32:07.594 --> 32:09.137
Can't I just pick off
one of the little sick ones?

32:09.263 --> 32:13.141
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

32:15.143 --> 32:18.772
There he is. Let's go.

32:19.231 --> 32:22.150
"Little roar." Puh!

32:24.486 --> 32:25.612
Rarr!

32:27.614 --> 32:28.824
Rrrarr!

32:32.786 --> 32:34.997
Rarr!

33:23.504 --> 33:25.464
Oh, look, sire, the herd is on the move.

33:25.547 --> 33:27.883
- Odd.
- Mufasa, quick.

33:27.966 --> 33:29.885
Stampede in the gorge.

33:29.968 --> 33:32.638
- Simba's down there!
- Simba?

33:54.701 --> 33:56.161
Zazu, help me!

33:56.245 --> 33:58.247
Your father is on the way! Hold on!

33:58.372 --> 33:59.540
Hurry!

34:03.001 --> 34:05.671
There! There on that tree!

34:05.754 --> 34:07.089
Hold on, Simba!

34:08.507 --> 34:10.007
Dad!

34:14.054 --> 34:16.098
Oh, Scar, this is awful!

34:16.181 --> 34:18.350
What'll we do? What'll we do?

34:18.433 --> 34:21.103
I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do.

34:57.054 --> 34:58.140
Dad!

35:20.996 --> 35:22.664
Scar!

35:23.332 --> 35:26.335
- Brother.
- Brother, help me!

35:34.343 --> 35:37.846
Long live the king.

35:42.851 --> 35:46.021
No!

35:58.867 --> 36:00.202
Dad!

36:12.548 --> 36:14.148
Dad?

36:53.463 --> 36:56.300
Dad, come on.

36:56.425 --> 36:59.261
You got to get up.

36:59.386 --> 37:01.346
Dad?

37:01.430 --> 37:03.390
We got to go home.

37:14.568 --> 37:16.069
Help!

37:18.614 --> 37:21.074
Somebody!

37:21.491 --> 37:22.951
Anybody.

37:24.661 --> 37:25.829
Help.

37:56.860 --> 38:00.531
Simba. What have you done?

38:02.157 --> 38:04.785
There were wildebeests,
and he tried to save me.

38:05.285 --> 38:08.038
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.

38:08.163 --> 38:12.334
Of course. Of course you didn't.

38:13.001 --> 38:17.881
No one ever means for
these things to happen.

38:18.006 --> 38:20.050
But the king is dead.

38:21.677 --> 38:24.680
And if it weren't for you,
he'd still be alive.

38:29.560 --> 38:32.020
Oh, what will your mother think?

38:32.354 --> 38:34.565
What am I going to do?

38:34.690 --> 38:36.024
Run away, Simba.

38:37.359 --> 38:42.406
Run. Run away and never return.

38:49.162 --> 38:50.539
Kill him.

39:43.592 --> 39:45.594
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.

39:46.261 --> 39:47.304
So go get him.

39:47.429 --> 39:49.223
There ain't no way I'm going in there.

39:49.306 --> 39:53.227
What, you want me to come out
looking like you, cactus butt?

39:54.269 --> 39:55.604
But we got to finish the job.

39:55.729 --> 39:58.732
Well, he's as good as
dead out there anyway.

39:58.815 --> 40:01.109
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.

40:01.610 --> 40:03.278
Yeah! You hear that?

40:04.071 --> 40:07.282
If you ever come back, we'll kill you!

40:15.749 --> 40:19.795
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

40:20.462 --> 40:24.258
But to lose Simba,
who had barely begun to live...

40:25.259 --> 40:30.055
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.

40:30.138 --> 40:34.101
So it is with a heavy heart
that I assume the throne.

40:34.184 --> 40:38.438
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy
we shall rise

40:38.522 --> 40:41.483
to greet the dawning of a new era

40:41.608 --> 40:45.362
in which lion and hyena come together

40:45.487 --> 40:49.783
in a great and glorious future.

41:32.367 --> 41:34.369
Yaaaah!

41:37.039 --> 41:39.208
Get out! Get out! Get out of here!

41:39.333 --> 41:41.668
I love this! Bowling for buzzards.

41:41.877 --> 41:45.339
Hee hee hee! Gets 'em every time.

41:45.547 --> 41:49.426
Hey, Timon, you better come look.

41:49.551 --> 41:51.553
I think it's still alive.

41:51.720 --> 41:52.930
Eeeuw.

41:53.222 --> 41:56.391
All righty, what have we got here?

42:02.356 --> 42:05.609
Jeez, it's a lion! Run, Pumbaa, move it!

42:05.734 --> 42:09.029
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.

42:09.112 --> 42:13.742
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.

42:14.076 --> 42:16.245
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?

42:16.328 --> 42:19.581
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.

42:19.665 --> 42:22.084
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.

42:22.251 --> 42:24.336
Maybe he'll be on our side.

42:24.419 --> 42:27.506
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...

42:27.589 --> 42:30.843
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

42:30.926 --> 42:34.263
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.

42:34.346 --> 42:35.430
So we're keeping him?

42:35.514 --> 42:37.766
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?

42:37.850 --> 42:39.434
My point exactly.

42:39.601 --> 42:42.855
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out
of here and find some shade.

42:51.446 --> 42:53.615
- You okay, kid?
- I guess so.

42:53.782 --> 42:54.950
You nearly died.

42:55.117 --> 42:56.702
I saved you.

42:56.785 --> 42:58.954
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.

42:59.037 --> 43:00.873
Thanks for your help.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.292
Hey, where you going?

43:03.458 --> 43:05.627
Nowhere.

43:05.711 --> 43:07.045
Gee, he looks blue.

43:07.129 --> 43:11.425
- I'd say brownish gold.
- No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.

43:13.093 --> 43:14.136
Kid, what's eating you?

43:14.219 --> 43:17.306
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.

43:19.725 --> 43:21.143
The food chain!

43:25.314 --> 43:26.732
So, where you from?

43:26.815 --> 43:28.817
Who cares? I can't go back.

43:29.067 --> 43:32.321
You're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.

43:32.446 --> 43:34.823
- What'd you do, kid?
- Something terrible.

43:34.907 --> 43:37.910
- But I don't want to talk about it.
- We don't want to hear about it.

43:37.993 --> 43:40.162
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

43:40.287 --> 43:42.915
Not unless you can change the past.

43:42.998 --> 43:46.251
You know, kid, in times like this,
my buddy Timon here says,

43:46.335 --> 43:48.837
"You got to put your
behind in your past."

43:48.962 --> 43:50.506
No, no, no.

43:50.631 --> 43:51.924
- I mean...
- Amateur.

43:52.007 --> 43:54.176
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

43:54.676 --> 43:57.429
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."

43:57.513 --> 44:01.517
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you
can't do anything about it, right?

44:01.600 --> 44:02.601
- Right.
- Wrong!

44:02.684 --> 44:05.354
When the world turns its back on you,

44:05.437 --> 44:08.106
you turn your back on the world.

44:08.190 --> 44:10.108
Well, that's not what I was taught.

44:10.192 --> 44:12.361
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

44:12.528 --> 44:14.780
Repeat after me.

44:14.863 --> 44:16.698

49:29.761 --> 49:33.682
Yeah. It's dinner time
and we ain't got no stinking entrées.

49:33.849 --> 49:38.187
It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting.

49:38.353 --> 49:40.439
- Yeah, but they won't go hunt.
- Oh...

49:40.522 --> 49:43.442
- Eat Zazu.
- Oh, you wouldn't want me.

49:43.525 --> 49:46.278
I'd be so tough and gamey and...

49:46.361 --> 49:49.781
Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garlic.

49:49.865 --> 49:51.950
I thought things
were bad under Mufasa.

49:52.034 --> 49:54.536
- What did you say?
- I said Muf...

49:54.661 --> 49:56.205
I said... <i>qué pasa</i> ?

49:56.371 --> 49:58.707
Good. Now get out.

50:01.043 --> 50:02.294
But we're still hungry.

50:02.377 --> 50:04.379
Out!

50:11.136 --> 50:14.306
- Nice one, Simba.
- Thanks.

50:14.389 --> 50:17.309
- Man, I'm stuffed.
- Me, too.

50:17.392 --> 50:19.645
I ate like a pig.

Oh. Right.

50:34.910 --> 50:37.663

- Yeah?

50:37.746 --> 50:41.834
Ever wonder what those
sparkling dots are up there?

50:41.917 --> 50:44.920
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.

50:45.170 --> 50:48.006
Oh? What are they?

50:48.090 --> 50:49.842
They're fireflies.

50:49.925 --> 50:54.346
Fireflies that got stuck
up in that big bluish-black thing.

50:54.429 --> 50:56.431
Oh, gee.

50:56.890 --> 50:59.685
I always thought they were balls of gas

50:59.768 --> 51:03.272
burning billions of miles away.

51:03.939 --> 51:07.025
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.

51:07.109 --> 51:09.111
Simba, what do you think?

51:09.528 --> 51:11.196
Well, I don't know.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.282
Oh, come on. Give, give, give, give.

51:13.407 --> 51:16.368

Really?

are watching us?

- Yeah, yeah.

51:38.140 --> 51:42.811
- What mook made that up?
- Yeah. Pretty dumb?

51:42.895 --> 51:45.981
- Aw, you're killing me.
- Yeah.

51:56.450 --> 51:58.535

She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.

They do?

56:22.966 --> 56:26.178
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.

56:26.345 --> 56:29.806
He did? What else did he tell you?

56:29.932 --> 56:35.229

And that means, you're the king.

56:49.117 --> 56:52.663
And don't! He's not the king. Are you?

56:52.746 --> 56:54.248
- No.
- Simba!

56:54.331 --> 56:56.875
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be,

56:56.959 --> 56:59.253
but that was a long time ago.

56:59.336 --> 57:03.090
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?

57:03.173 --> 57:05.926

- But with power.

- Everything's destroyed.

01:01:49.126 --> 01:01:50.210

01:01:50.294 --> 01:01:53.547
and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:58.135
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.096
I left to find help, and I found you.

01:02:01.305 --> 01:02:05.601
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.

01:02:05.684 --> 01:02:08.520

- What's happened to you?

01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:12.566
- You're not the Simba I remember.
- You're right. I'm not.

01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:16.236
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. Just disappointed.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.114
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.

01:02:19.198 --> 01:02:21.158
Good. At least one of us does.

01:02:22.367 --> 01:02:25.579
You think you can just show
up and tell me how to live my life?

01:02:25.662 --> 01:02:27.664
You don't even know

01:02:27.748 --> 01:02:29.082

- Fine!

01:02:34.838 --> 01:02:37.674
She's wrong. I can't go back.

01:02:38.133 --> 01:02:41.845
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.

Will you stop following me?

01:03:55.085 --> 01:03:58.922

- The question is, who are you?

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:05.137
I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure.

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:09.016

Wrong! I'm not the one who's confused.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.189
Stop!

01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:45.529
Look down there.

01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:13.682
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.

01:06:13.765 --> 01:06:15.434
No.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:19.396
Look harder.

01:06:25.611 --> 01:06:26.945
You see?

01:06:28.238 --> 01:06:30.741
He lives in you.

01:06:34.912 --> 01:06:37.581
Simba.

01:06:37.664 --> 01:06:39.291
Father?

01:06:47.216 --> 01:06:49.968
Simba, you have forgotten me.

01:06:50.093 --> 01:06:52.179
No. How could I?

01:06:52.262 --> 01:06:57.017
You have forgotten who you are,
and so have forgotten me.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.353
Look inside yourself, Simba.

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:03.524
You are more than
what you have become.

01:07:03.607 --> 01:07:06.944
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

01:07:07.027 --> 01:07:10.948
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:14.952
Remember who you are.

01:07:15.035 --> 01:07:18.956
You are my son and the one true king.

01:07:20.832 --> 01:07:24.461
Remember who you are.

01:07:24.545 --> 01:07:27.381
No! Please, don't leave me!

01:07:27.464 --> 01:07:28.632
Remember.

01:07:28.715 --> 01:07:30.300
- Father!
- Remember!

01:07:30.384 --> 01:07:32.344
Don't leave me.

01:07:32.427 --> 01:07:34.346
Remember.

01:07:42.938 --> 01:07:44.982
What was that?

01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:46.775
The weather.

01:07:46.859 --> 01:07:50.529
- Very peculiar, don't you think?
- Yeah.

01:07:51.113 --> 01:07:52.614
Looks like the winds are changing.

01:07:52.698 --> 01:07:55.242
Change is good.

01:07:55.659 --> 01:07:57.494
Yeah, but it's not easy.

01:07:57.578 --> 01:08:02.583
I know what I have to do, but going
back means I'll have to face my past.

01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:05.752
I've been running from it
for so long.

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:09.006
Jeez! What was that for?

01:08:09.089 --> 01:08:11.967
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:14.052
Yeah, but it still hurts.

01:08:14.136 --> 01:08:16.430
Oh, yes, the past can hurt.

01:08:16.513 --> 01:08:20.100
But the way I see it
you can either run from it

01:08:20.184 --> 01:08:23.020
or learn from it.

01:08:23.103 --> 01:08:25.898
You see?
So what are you going to do?

01:08:26.106 --> 01:08:28.567
First, I'm gonna take your stick.

01:08:28.649 --> 01:08:30.903
No, no, no, no! Not the stick!

01:08:30.986 --> 01:08:34.573
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I'm going back!

01:08:34.656 --> 01:08:37.576
Good! Go on! Get out of here!

01:08:42.622 --> 01:08:46.627
Whoooo! Whoooo!

01:08:54.468 --> 01:08:55.636
Grubs! Grubs!

01:09:01.183 --> 01:09:03.143
Hey. Hey, wake up.

01:09:07.147 --> 01:09:10.567
It's okay! It's okay! It's me!

01:09:11.652 --> 01:09:14.112
Don't ever do that again.

01:09:14.404 --> 01:09:16.113
Carnivores! Oy!

01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:18.825
- Have you guys seen Simba?
- I thought he was with you.

01:09:18.908 --> 01:09:21.578
He was, but now I can't find him.
Where is he?

01:09:21.662 --> 01:09:23.622
Ho ho! You won't find him here!

01:09:23.913 --> 01:09:27.042
The king has returned.

01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:30.337
I can't believe it. He's gone back!

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.256
Gone back? What do you mean?

01:09:32.421 --> 01:09:35.341
Hey, what's goin' on here?

01:09:35.425 --> 01:09:37.761
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba went back to challenge Scar.

01:09:37.845 --> 01:09:38.929
- Who?
- Scar.

01:09:39.011 --> 01:09:40.848
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:42.683
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No!

01:09:42.765 --> 01:09:46.353
Simba's gone back to challenge
his uncle to take his place as king.

01:09:46.435 --> 01:09:47.729
Oh.

01:10:44.995 --> 01:10:46.997
Simba, wait up!

01:10:50.584 --> 01:10:54.880
- It's awful, isn't it?
- I didn't want to believe you.

01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:56.882
What made you come back?

01:10:57.341 --> 01:10:59.843
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,

01:11:00.177 --> 01:11:02.221
and I've got the bump to prove it.

01:11:02.596 --> 01:11:05.015
Besides, this is my kingdom.

01:11:05.349 --> 01:11:08.143
If I don't fight for it, who will?

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:11.230
- I will.
- It's gonna be dangerous.

01:11:11.313 --> 01:11:15.776
Danger?
I laugh in the face of danger.

01:11:15.859 --> 01:11:17.611
I see nothing funny about this.

01:11:17.694 --> 01:11:20.697
Timon! Pumbaa!
What are you doing here?

01:11:20.822 --> 01:11:22.950
At your service, my liege.

01:11:23.033 --> 01:11:26.703
Aww! We're gonna fight your uncle
for this?

01:11:27.162 --> 01:11:30.457
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:32.876
Oh. Talk about your fixer-upper!

01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:37.464
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.

01:11:56.233 --> 01:12:00.112
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

01:12:00.195 --> 01:12:02.656
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?

01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:06.118
- Live bait.
- Good idea. Hey!

01:12:06.201 --> 01:12:08.996
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

01:12:09.246 --> 01:12:11.707
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

01:12:11.915 --> 01:12:13.876
Luau!

01:12:13.959 --> 01:12:15.669
♪ If you're hungry for a hunk
♪ of fat and juicy meat

01:12:15.752 --> 01:12:17.504
♪ Eat my buddy Pumbaa here
♪ because he is a treat

01:12:17.588 --> 01:12:19.548
♪ Come on down and dine
♪ on this tasty swine

01:12:19.631 --> 01:12:21.633
♪ All you have to do is get in line

01:12:21.758 --> 01:12:23.552
- ♪ Are you achin'
- Yep, yep, yep.

01:12:23.635 --> 01:12:25.512
- ♪ For some bacon?
- Yep, yep, yep.

01:12:25.596 --> 01:12:27.181
- ♪ He's a big pig
- Yep, yep.

01:12:27.264 --> 01:12:29.349
♪ You could be a big pig, too! Oi!

01:12:34.354 --> 01:12:37.691
Nala, you find my mother
and rally the lionesses.

01:12:37.774 --> 01:12:40.694
I'll look for Scar.

01:12:43.113 --> 01:12:44.823
Sarabi!

01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:00.714
Yes, Scar?

01:13:00.797 --> 01:13:04.259
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing theirjob.

01:13:04.343 --> 01:13:07.221
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

01:13:07.471 --> 01:13:09.973
No, you're just not
looking hard enough.

01:13:10.057 --> 01:13:14.061
It's over. There is nothing left.

01:13:14.144 --> 01:13:18.023
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

01:13:18.148 --> 01:13:21.568
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.

01:13:21.652 --> 01:13:23.820
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.

01:13:23.904 --> 01:13:26.198
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:28.700
If you were half the king Mufasa was...

01:13:28.784 --> 01:13:31.370
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was!

01:13:34.373 --> 01:13:36.792
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

01:13:44.091 --> 01:13:45.717
Mufasa?

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.137
No. It's me.

01:13:49.888 --> 01:13:54.893
Simba! You're alive? How can that be?

01:13:54.977 --> 01:13:58.772
It doesn't matter. I'm home.

01:13:58.856 --> 01:14:00.190
Simba?

01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:04.862
Simba! Oh, I'm a little surprised
to see you

01:14:04.945 --> 01:14:06.405
alive.

01:14:08.031 --> 01:14:11.577
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:13.620
Oh, Simba, you must understand.

01:14:13.704 --> 01:14:16.081
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

01:14:16.164 --> 01:14:19.418
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

01:14:19.501 --> 01:14:21.920
Oh, well, I would, naturally.

01:14:22.045 --> 01:14:24.965
However, there is one little problem.

01:14:25.382 --> 01:14:26.842
You see them?

01:14:28.552 --> 01:14:30.846
They think <i>I'm king</i>.

01:14:30.929 --> 01:14:34.683
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.

01:14:34.766 --> 01:14:36.685
The choice is yours, Scar.

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.271
Either step down or fight.

01:14:39.354 --> 01:14:41.773
Oh, must this all end in violence?

01:14:42.274 --> 01:14:46.069
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:49.406
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.

01:14:49.907 --> 01:14:51.033
I've put it behind me.

01:14:51.116 --> 01:14:52.951
But what about your faithful subjects?

01:14:53.035 --> 01:14:54.995
Have they put it behind them?

01:14:55.078 --> 01:14:57.164
Simba, what is he talking about?

01:14:57.247 --> 01:15:01.502
So you haven't told them
your little secret.

01:15:01.585 --> 01:15:04.963
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

01:15:05.047 --> 01:15:09.218
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

01:15:12.262 --> 01:15:13.430
I am.

01:15:17.809 --> 01:15:20.354
It's not true.

01:15:20.771 --> 01:15:23.106
Tell me it's not true.

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:27.819
- It's true.
- You see? He admits it!

01:15:27.903 --> 01:15:30.906
- Murderer!
- No! It was an accident.

01:15:30.989 --> 01:15:34.701
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. It's your fault he's dead!

01:15:34.785 --> 01:15:36.370
- Do you deny it?
- No.

01:15:36.453 --> 01:15:40.582
- Then you're guilty.
- No, I'm not a murderer!

01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:43.001
Oh, Simba, you're in trouble again,

01:15:43.126 --> 01:15:46.088
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

01:15:46.171 --> 01:15:49.466
and now everyone knows why!

01:15:50.551 --> 01:15:51.635
Simba!

01:15:57.224 --> 01:16:00.060
Now, this looks familiar.

01:16:01.895 --> 01:16:05.858
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think.

01:16:05.941 --> 01:16:08.569
Oh, yes. I remember.

01:16:09.152 --> 01:16:12.823
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:18.412
And here's <i>my little secret</i>.

01:16:18.871 --> 01:16:21.999
I killed Mufasa.

01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:26.712
No! Murderer!

01:16:27.504 --> 01:16:29.965
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.

01:16:30.048 --> 01:16:33.760
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold...

01:16:34.219 --> 01:16:35.262
All right.

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:37.556
All right.

01:16:38.599 --> 01:16:40.100
I did it.

01:16:40.184 --> 01:16:42.102
So they can hear you.

01:16:43.145 --> 01:16:46.315
I killed Mufasa!

01:16:56.366 --> 01:16:58.410
Hee-yah!

01:16:58.493 --> 01:17:01.705
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin' through. Hot stuff.

01:17:28.023 --> 01:17:29.525
Aagghh!

01:17:31.026 --> 01:17:33.529
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Let me in! Let me in!

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.241
Please, don't eat me.

01:17:37.324 --> 01:17:38.909
Drop 'em!

01:17:38.992 --> 01:17:41.328
- Hey, who's the pig?
- Are you talkin' to me?

01:17:41.411 --> 01:17:43.372
- He called him a pig.
- To me?

01:17:43.455 --> 01:17:45.290
- Shouldn't have done that.
- To me?

01:17:45.374 --> 01:17:51.088
- Now they're in for it.
- They call me <i>Mr Pig</i>!

01:17:51.338 --> 01:17:54.216
Aaaaggghhh!

01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:57.010
Take that, you stupid...

01:17:57.094 --> 01:17:59.096
Take that and that!

01:18:02.683 --> 01:18:04.726
Run, you yellow-belly!

01:18:24.788 --> 01:18:27.624
- Murderer.
- Simba. Simba, please.

01:18:27.749 --> 01:18:31.628
- Please, have mercy. I beg you.
- You don't deserve to live.

01:18:31.712 --> 01:18:37.134
But Simba, I am family.

01:18:37.467 --> 01:18:40.679
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.

01:18:42.431 --> 01:18:43.390
It was their fault. It was their idea.

01:18:43.473 --> 01:18:45.517
Why should I believe you?

01:18:46.018 --> 01:18:48.687
Everything you ever told me was a lie.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:50.731
What are you going to do?

01:18:50.814 --> 01:18:54.401
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.

01:18:54.818 --> 01:18:56.945
No, Scar.

01:18:57.279 --> 01:18:58.822
I'm not like you.

01:18:58.906 --> 01:19:02.159
Oh, Simba, thank you.
You are truly noble.

01:19:02.242 --> 01:19:06.038
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?

01:19:06.121 --> 01:19:07.748
Tell me. I mean, anything.

01:19:08.207 --> 01:19:09.333
Run.

01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:11.960
Run away, Scar,

01:19:12.085 --> 01:19:14.296
and never return.

01:19:15.214 --> 01:19:17.216
Yes.

01:19:17.299 --> 01:19:19.426
Of course.

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:22.179
As you wish,

01:19:22.304 --> 01:19:24.348
your Majesty!

01:20:17.568 --> 01:20:21.071
My friends!

01:20:21.154 --> 01:20:24.992
Friends? I thought he said
we were the enemy.
