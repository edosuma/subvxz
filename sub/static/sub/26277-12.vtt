WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:03.337
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.772
Find her.

00:05.772 --> 00:08.408
I don't think we're
supposed to find anyone.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.077
I think I'm having
someone else's calling.

00:10.077 --> 00:13.313
No matter what I do, I'm the
bad guy, and I'm tired of it.

00:13.313 --> 00:14.581
So we're not doing this.

00:14.581 --> 00:15.916
Michaela:
He loves you.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.285
And I love him.
I just hope it'll be enough.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.120
The Major
would like a word.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.723
I knew. It's like
the subway tunnels, Dad.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.524
They're right here.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.193
Saanvi: I think I found
the Major's Holy Grail.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.629
They found that some
of the passengers

00:28.629 --> 00:30.397
are more sensitive
to the callings.

00:30.397 --> 00:31.732
Cal.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.066
If the Major finds out
what he can do...

00:33.066 --> 00:34.835
We got to make sure
she never does.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.507
Cal!

00:48.282 --> 00:49.983
No, no, no, no.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.819
I said no police, damn it.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.097
Whoa, whoa.
Sir, sir.

01:04.097 --> 01:05.399
No, no, no, no.
I-I'm Ben Stone.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.967
Thi-- This is my house,
my family --

01:06.967 --> 01:08.435
Calm down.
Let me see some I.D.

01:09.970 --> 01:13.607
Olive:

01:13.607 --> 01:15.242
He's, uh -- He's small,

01:15.242 --> 01:18.145
and he's been really --
he's been really sick.

01:19.446 --> 01:22.616
I have a photo.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.420
Jackson: These are just
elimination prints.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.221
Grace: Mm-hmm.

01:28.221 --> 01:31.024
Thank you.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.593
Mrs. Stone, does your son
have a history of running away?

01:33.593 --> 01:35.128
No, no.

01:35.128 --> 01:37.864
Uh, well, he did go off
once recently.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.099
Anything going on
at home

01:39.099 --> 01:40.901
that might make him
want to leave?

01:41.735 --> 01:44.071
His father moved out
two weeks ago.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.807
That's Benjamin Stone?
Yes.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.042
Who was with Cal
on Flight 828?

01:49.042 --> 01:50.410
Yes, yes,
but they talk every day.

01:50.410 --> 01:51.945
They see each other
all the time.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.180
Cal didn't go off
to see Ben.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.848
Something
must've happened.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.717
Any sense
of what that might be?

01:59.753 --> 02:01.655
Mrs. Stone,
are you aware of someone

02:01.655 --> 02:03.490
that might want
to harm Cal?

02:03.490 --> 02:05.225
No.

02:05.225 --> 02:08.228
But his father thinks --

02:08.228 --> 02:10.697
Grace. Grace.
Oh, my God.

02:15.435 --> 02:18.005
Jackson:
Mr. Stone.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.339
Yes?

02:19.339 --> 02:20.540
Your ex-wife
was about to --

02:20.540 --> 02:24.044
No, we're --
we're still married.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.380
Your wife was about to share
a theory of yours

02:26.380 --> 02:28.448
about someone who might want
to harm your son.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.588
Well, Cal has been a bit of
a celebrity since we came back,

02:34.588 --> 02:36.857
a lot
of unwanted attention,

02:36.857 --> 02:39.226
but, no,
nothing specific.

02:39.226 --> 02:43.330
Mr. Stone, can you tell me
your whereabouts this evening?

02:43.330 --> 02:44.998
I was with my sister,
Detective Michaela Stone.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.433
No, this has nothing to do
with Ben.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.602
I can assure you.

02:53.607 --> 02:54.975
Michaela,
what are you doing here?

02:54.975 --> 02:56.476
Where is he?

02:56.476 --> 02:57.844
Where is he?!
Who?

02:57.844 --> 02:59.946
Don't mess with me, Autumn.
Where's Cal?

02:59.946 --> 03:01.014
Michaela,
I swear to you,

03:01.014 --> 03:02.616
I have zero idea
what you're talking about!

03:02.616 --> 03:04.651
We know that you're the mole,
Autumn.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.486
We know that you have been
working with the Major,

03:06.486 --> 03:07.687
whoever the hell
that is.

03:07.687 --> 03:08.955
So if you
don't have Cal here,

03:08.955 --> 03:11.558
I'm guessing
the Major does.

03:11.558 --> 03:15.862
You are gonna tell me
exactly where he is.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.331
Michaela,
you have to believe me.

03:18.331 --> 03:19.433
The hell I do.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.301
You have been lying to us
since the moment you got here.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.703
We brought you in, Autumn.
We protected you.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.705
Michaela, I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:30.277 --> 03:31.711
Olive, what's up?

03:31.711 --> 03:33.547
Hey.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.849
The cops.
They think it's Dad.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.050
You need to come.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.351
Yeah,
I'll be right there.

03:38.351 --> 03:41.121
You, too. Come on.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.457
You've got it all wrong.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.490
Police activity
at the Ben Stone residence.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.259
The call was for
a missing child.

04:24.564 --> 04:26.166
You've been monitoring
the chatter?

04:26.166 --> 04:28.201
They've got
an ECT team on site.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.670
They're canvassing
the neighborhood.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.506
They'll focus on
the family first.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.841
Monitor the situation
and report back.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.610
I need
to keep her apprised.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.811
Copy.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.980
Go in closer.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.119
Hey, can you
keep an eye on her?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.221
Yes, ma'am.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.999
We never should've
called the cops.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.668
Who doesn't call the cops
when their child goes missing?

05:01.668 --> 05:03.036
I know.
It sounds...

05:03.036 --> 05:04.938
Bu-But the people
who I think are behind this

05:04.938 --> 05:07.374
are higher up
on the food chain -- way higher.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.875
We-We're playing
into their hands

05:08.875 --> 05:10.010
by having
the cops here.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.344
What does that
even mean?

05:11.344 --> 05:13.079
Hey.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.215
Um, I have Autumn
in the car.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.050
She's denying everything.
Of course she is.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.418
Yeah,
my thoughts exactly.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.687
Who's Autumn?
Is she involved in this?

05:20.687 --> 05:22.055
We think so.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.457
She's a passenger
from 828.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.993
We're all but certain
the Major sent her to spy on us.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.762
The Major?

05:28.762 --> 05:29.996
I-I'm sorry.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.165
She's been secretly
investigating Flight 828,

05:32.165 --> 05:34.768
the passengers,
us.

05:36.136 --> 05:39.306
What does she want
with our son?

05:39.306 --> 05:41.007
Grace, you know
that ever since the flight,

05:41.007 --> 05:42.209
we have been
hearing things,

05:42.209 --> 05:43.443
some of us
seeing things.

05:43.443 --> 05:46.146
And this
is happening to Cal?

05:48.782 --> 05:51.418
In a sense.

05:51.418 --> 05:54.221
But he seems
to be experiencing them

05:54.221 --> 05:58.058
more strongly
than anyone else.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.694
Why wouldn't you
tell me this?

06:00.694 --> 06:04.164
I-I'm sorry.
I...

06:04.164 --> 06:05.732
Ben was trying
to protect you, Grace.

06:05.732 --> 06:08.068
We thought that
they were dangerous to you,

06:08.068 --> 06:11.104
to non-passengers.

06:11.104 --> 06:11.905
When we shared
the details,

06:11.905 --> 06:13.340
it got people killed.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.508
It happened to the friends
of this other passenger.

06:15.508 --> 06:16.910
Harvey Stein.
It almost happened
to Jared.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.245
But it didn't.

06:18.245 --> 06:22.949
So, now we think -- hope --
that it was a...

06:22.949 --> 06:24.818
tragic fluke.

06:35.128 --> 06:39.532
Okay, the era
of you protecting me,

06:39.532 --> 06:41.101
that's over.

06:42.602 --> 06:45.505
If you know something
that will help us find Cal,

06:45.505 --> 06:47.741
I want
to hear about it.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.644
Ben,
I would rather die

06:50.644 --> 06:53.413
than not do
everything in my power

06:53.413 --> 06:54.915
to save our son.

07:05.225 --> 07:08.695
We somehow think
the Major knows about Cal.

07:08.695 --> 07:09.929
Knows what, exactly?

07:09.929 --> 07:12.432
That he draws things.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.134
Yeah.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.568
And sometimes, the things
that he draws,

07:15.568 --> 07:18.772
they've happened already,
but he couldn't have known.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.107
Other times,
they haven't happened yet,

07:21.107 --> 07:22.475
and when they do --

07:22.475 --> 07:25.111
What -- What do you mean
he draws them?

07:38.658 --> 07:41.061
Ben: Look.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.731
This is Thomas.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.433
He was a stowaway
on 828.

07:46.433 --> 07:51.504
Cal knew -- knew his name,
even where he was hiding.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.374
And this is a place
where we found a group
of missing passengers.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.644
And this...

07:59.079 --> 08:01.147
Is that...?

08:01.147 --> 08:03.750
Us.

08:03.750 --> 08:07.153
Right now.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.794
Now what?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.275
Grace: God,
he looks terrified.

08:29.275 --> 08:30.877
Yeah, but just because
he drew it

08:30.877 --> 08:32.512
doesn't necessarily mean
that --

08:32.512 --> 08:33.847
You said yourself all these
other drawings came true.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.648
Why shouldn't we
assume the same of this one?

08:35.648 --> 08:38.518
Wait, wait, wait.
There's more pages, guys.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.054
Is that the Major?

08:41.054 --> 08:42.555
Maybe.
I don't know.

08:42.555 --> 08:46.126
Okay. There's got to be
something else in there.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.027
There's a page missing.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.896
Maybe he took it
with him.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.699
Or someone stole it.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.834
Autumn, sh-she was
at the apartment with Cal.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.137
She...was looking
at his sketches.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.739
So if she's got the page,
I'll get it back.

08:59.739 --> 09:00.740
Wait.

09:00.740 --> 09:07.614
All these --
trees, lake, rocks.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.583
I think
he left us a map.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.952
It looks like upstate,
but where?

09:12.952 --> 09:15.021
Wait.
Go back.

09:15.021 --> 09:16.289
I recognize this.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.857
Last summer,
I was in Tannersville

09:17.857 --> 09:19.626
in the Catskills,
the Town Square.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.462
This flagpole, the statue under
the steeple of the church --

09:22.462 --> 09:24.230
it looked
just like this.
You're positive?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.565
No,
it's a crayon drawing.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.333
I'm not positive,
but it could be.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.535
Then we should
get up there.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.103
I mean,
if you're right,

09:30.103 --> 09:31.638
the other drawings could be
landmarks that'll show up.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.406
What about the 19 cops
in our house?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.841
No, they can't know
any of this.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.810
We have to assume
the Major has eyes and ears

09:36.810 --> 09:38.311
up and down
law enforcement.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.880
We have to
get rid of them.
How?

09:43.983 --> 09:46.286
Let me make a call.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.495
Grace. Ben.

09:55.495 --> 09:58.231
Hey,
Cal's fine.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.099
He's fine.
He's with Steve.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.702
Oh, my God.
Did you talk to him?
Yeah, I just saw him.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.704
He's fast asleep.
Steve had his phone off.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.407
He had no idea
we'd be calling.
Oh, God.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.509
Thank you.
Yeah.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.010
Hey, Chris.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.245
Hey.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.147
I didn't know
you were working this case.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.482
I'm friends
with the family,

10:15.482 --> 10:17.283
so I thought
I'd help out.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.485
False alarm?

10:18.485 --> 10:20.220
Yeah, kid's with
his grandfather.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.821
You know,
the whole family,

10:21.821 --> 10:24.023
they've been a bit edgy
since the plane came back.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.459
I think they just jumped
to the worst-case scenario.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.328
You sure about this?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.200
That picture
was taken today?

10:34.200 --> 10:36.302
Yeah,
10 minutes ago.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.573
Okay, well,
good news, then.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.742
Great news.
Mm.

10:42.742 --> 10:46.212
All right, guys,
wrap it up.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.081
False alarm.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.351
Thanks so much.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.952
I'm so sorry.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.088
I'm just glad
your son is safe.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.756
Thank you.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.865
Thank you.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.100
Yeah,
no biggie.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.535
Just my career.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.270
We have a suspect
in the car.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.871
We think that she knows
where Cal went.

11:11.871 --> 11:13.673
We can take her in
and work that angle.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.909
You want to take a kidnapping
suspect into the precinct

11:15.909 --> 11:18.344
after I just told half the NYPD
there's no missing kid?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.246
She has tons of open warrants
from before 828.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.448
Once we get her in the box,
we can ask her whatever we want.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.284
Uh, no, we're sending
the cops away why?

11:24.284 --> 11:25.919
Because we know more
than they do.

11:25.919 --> 11:26.920
Trust me.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.421
All right,
Grace and I are gonna

11:28.421 --> 11:29.789
start the drive
up to Tannersville.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.190
We'll look for Cal's clues
along the way.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.725
Michaela:
Hey, borrow a car.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.761
Anything registered to you
is gonna tip off the Major

11:34.761 --> 11:37.530
by the time you hit
the first tollbooth.
All right.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.066
What is it?

11:40.066 --> 11:41.467
Uh...

11:41.467 --> 11:43.870
Danny has a truck.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.241
Then let's
go get it.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.044
I'll text him.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.584
I want to help.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.320
You're home base.
Grandpa's on his way.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.956
Lock the door.
Open for him but nobody else.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.925
If either one of you
sees anything or hears anything,

12:05.925 --> 12:07.427
you call us ASAP.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.797
Hey, we're gonna find him,
all right?

12:10.797 --> 12:13.266
This is
gonna be okay.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.172
Lock the door.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.494
So, this is
his other vehicle?

12:41.494 --> 12:42.762
He's outdoorsy.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.998
He has
a lot of gear.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.535
Reporter:
Expect low, frigid temperatures

12:49.535 --> 12:51.170
for the next four days.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.006
An hours-long high-speed chase
throughout the boroughs

12:53.006 --> 12:55.208
ended in tragedy
early this morning.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.711
The driver, the primary suspect
in a brazen double homicide

12:58.711 --> 13:00.279
and theft of an armored car,

13:00.279 --> 13:02.882
plunged the stolen vehicle
into the East River.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.685
Well, at least for once,
it's not about Flight 828.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.056
We should keep it on.
We might hear something helpful.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.992
If there's news,
Michaela will have it first.

13:15.094 --> 13:17.063
I need to think.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.868
When you
supposedly escaped,

13:21.868 --> 13:25.104
why'd you go to Ben,
of all people?

13:27.340 --> 13:28.908
Okay, how about
this one, then?

13:28.908 --> 13:31.678
You and I have not hung out once
since you've shown up.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.880
Then, all of a sudden,
you're knocking on my door

13:33.880 --> 13:35.915
when Cal just so happens
to be there.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.583
And now
Cal is in danger --

13:37.583 --> 13:39.118
I think
because of you.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.386
I also think

13:40.386 --> 13:43.256
that you took a page
out of Cal's sketchbook.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.391
You know,
for a con artist,

13:45.391 --> 13:47.527
your poker face
sucks hard.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.828
I need the page,
Autumn.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.630
You're gonna tell me
where it is.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.566
A boy's life
is on the line.

13:53.566 --> 13:57.270
Even if I knew something,
I could never tell you.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.538
She'd find out.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.772
She would know.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.808
What does she have on you,
Autumn?

14:01.808 --> 14:04.277
It can't just be about a few
old identity-theft warrants.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.546
It's not just
about me.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.748
What does that mean?

14:08.748 --> 14:11.651
Autumn,
who else is it about?

14:23.629 --> 14:26.099
NYPD left
the Stone residence,

14:26.099 --> 14:27.533
but so have
Grace and Ben Stone.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.735
We're tracking
their vehicle,

14:28.735 --> 14:30.703
but it's been stationary
for a while.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.138
They may have
swapped cars.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.273
Get some bodies
in the field.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.642
Generate a list
of potential vehicles --

14:36.642 --> 14:38.644
family members,
colleagues, friends.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.012
That's not all.

14:40.012 --> 14:42.081
Autumn Cox is
in police custody.

14:50.823 --> 14:54.827
It's Jansen.
I need to speak to the Major.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.662
It's urgent.

15:09.108 --> 15:12.612
This is it --
Tannersville.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.680
The statue,
the steeple, the flagpole --

15:14.680 --> 15:17.183
it all matches.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.624
This is incredible.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.692
He drew
every last detail.

15:28.294 --> 15:32.131
Let's park back there,
show his picture around.

15:32.131 --> 15:34.700
Michaela:
How many years ago was that?

15:34.700 --> 15:36.903
Can you spell that last name?

15:38.137 --> 15:41.274
Yeah, and -- and do they have
an address?

15:44.043 --> 15:46.479
Great. Thank you.
You've been a lot of help.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.020
How are you cold?

15:54.020 --> 15:55.421
They just jacked the heat up
in here.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.190
I don't know, but listen.
That was Social Services.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.825
Autumn had a kid,
a daughter.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.326
She's 8 years old,

16:00.326 --> 16:01.761
which means she was a toddler
when the plane disappeared.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.296
Really?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.164
She already lost custody due to
a prison stint back in 2011,

16:05.164 --> 16:08.100
but the woman that she asked me
to track down, Clarissa Ford?

16:08.100 --> 16:10.536
It turns out that
that's the kid's foster mom.

16:10.536 --> 16:11.804
Does she still have
the kid?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.139
No, she was adopted out
four years ago,

16:13.139 --> 16:15.074
but that's who
she's talking about, Jared.

16:15.074 --> 16:17.376
"It's not just about me."
She's talking about her kid.

16:17.376 --> 16:19.779
The -- The Major must've
tracked her down.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.013
That's her leverage.

16:21.013 --> 16:22.882
So Autumn spies on
the passengers,

16:22.882 --> 16:25.852
and in return, the Major
reunites her with her daughter.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.286
That's why
she's so scared.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.422
She doesn't want to do anything
that might jeopardi--

16:29.422 --> 16:31.190
Yeah?

16:31.190 --> 16:33.593
We've tracked down
the kid, too,

16:33.593 --> 16:35.261
so we can make a deal
with Autumn.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.829
Well, we better move fast.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.698
The Feds just voided
her warrants.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.366
What are
you talking about?

16:40.366 --> 16:43.202
Whoever this Major is,
she's pulling strings.

16:43.202 --> 16:45.805
It's only
a matter of time

16:45.805 --> 16:47.540
before we have to
cut Autumn loose.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.113
Excuse me.
Hi.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.515
Hi, there.
Hi. We're looking for our son.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.717
Did you see him?

16:57.717 --> 16:59.151
Excuse me, sir,
his name is Cal.

16:59.151 --> 17:01.454
Excuse, me, sir, hi.
No?

17:01.454 --> 17:04.257
My son is lost.
Did you maybe see -- no?

17:04.257 --> 17:06.092
Sir, have you seen
this little boy?

17:06.092 --> 17:08.828
Please,
I-I-I'm looking for this boy.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.563
His name is Cal.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.602
You have no idea
what it's like,

17:16.602 --> 17:18.304
knowing your child
is this close

17:18.304 --> 17:20.306
and not being able
to see her,

17:20.306 --> 17:21.607
begging this woman --

17:21.607 --> 17:23.342
The Major.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.580
I told her
that Cal was special,

17:27.580 --> 17:31.017
that somehow he knew things
he shouldn't have known.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.986
Cal's sketchbook --
you tore a page out of it,

17:33.986 --> 17:37.990
a picture
of where he was going.

17:37.990 --> 17:42.395
You sold out another child
to get your own.

17:43.829 --> 17:46.566
I didn't
give her the drawing.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.867
I swear to you.

17:47.867 --> 17:51.070
Autumn, you can
make this right still.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.040
I can help you
see your child.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.676
Do you know
where she is?

17:56.676 --> 17:58.277
I know exactly
where she is,

17:58.277 --> 18:01.113
but you have to help us
find Cal first.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.618
I can't
take the risk.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.320
If the Major
finds out,

18:07.320 --> 18:09.655
I don't know
what she'll do.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.094
We're out of time, Mick.
Captain wants to kick her.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.096
You know we cannot keep her
without federal warrants.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.564
Give me
one more minute.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.472
Flight 828 --
it happened for a reason.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.207
I believe
that it brought us together

18:28.207 --> 18:29.942
so that we could help
each other, trust each other.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.777
Autumn,
look at me.

18:33.546 --> 18:37.316
Do you really think
you can trust the Major?

18:47.426 --> 18:51.530
Sweetheart,
why don't you come downstairs?

18:51.530 --> 18:53.332
I made us some soup.

18:53.332 --> 18:57.603
This can't
be happening again.

18:59.405 --> 19:02.742
This is exactly how I felt
the last time.

19:02.742 --> 19:06.078
Hey, come here.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.747
Huh?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.817
Your parents
are on this.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.353
They're not gonna stop
until they find him.

19:14.353 --> 19:15.621
Mm?

19:16.889 --> 19:18.924
And neither am I.

19:18.924 --> 19:22.294
I can feel him,
just like the last time.

19:22.294 --> 19:26.565
I think he's in danger
and he's terrified

19:26.565 --> 19:29.835
and it's like he's trying
to send me, like...

19:31.037 --> 19:33.305
Oh, my God.
What is it?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.175
There's this secret place,
a ledge.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.010
When --
When we were little,

19:38.010 --> 19:40.579
we used to leave messages
for each other.

19:42.948 --> 19:45.251
Grandpa.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.189
Son of a gun.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.059
Cal didn't want Mom and Dad
to know he took off.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.161
Oh, my God.
He wanted me to find this.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.929
Well,
they need to know now.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.832
We need to send this
to your parents.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.438
Grace: I just
can't help but think

20:05.438 --> 20:07.039
that if we'd been living
under the same roof,

20:07.039 --> 20:09.008
then Cal wouldn't be missing
right now.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.310
You're right,

20:11.310 --> 20:14.914
but that doesn't mean you should
start blaming yourself.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.449
Actually, I wasn't,

20:16.449 --> 20:18.350
but it kind of sounds like
you're blaming me.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.519
No, no, no.
I'm agreeing with you.

20:20.519 --> 20:21.887
I'm blaming us.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.057
Do you think that I want
to be separated?

20:26.292 --> 20:29.395
Grace,
you kicked me out.

20:29.395 --> 20:33.532
And you went
with zero objection

20:33.532 --> 20:37.236
because you knew
that you had put your need

20:37.236 --> 20:39.405
to save every other passenger
on that plane

20:39.405 --> 20:41.273
ahead of the needs
of your family.

20:41.273 --> 20:44.009
Grace, everything I've done
has been for you and the kids.

20:44.009 --> 20:48.247
I get that, Ben,
but you went too far.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.050
Where are
the other 190 passengers

20:51.050 --> 20:53.252
sacrificing
their families?

20:58.457 --> 20:59.658
Oh, my God.

20:59.658 --> 21:02.294
Thank you,
Olive.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.866
"I left"?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.701
It's definitely
his writing.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.437
So he wasn't taken?

21:11.437 --> 21:13.139
Could he have traveled here
all by himself?

21:13.139 --> 21:14.273
It's possible.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.442
When he showed up to Red Hook,
he took the subway by himself,

21:16.442 --> 21:18.711
and then he transferred
to a city bus.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.713
It's like
a-an instinct.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.215
He's following something.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.851
You're talking about
the callings.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.353
He could've gone
to the bus station,

21:27.353 --> 21:28.554
bought a ticket.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.626
Ben.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.269
Do you think
they're looking for Cal?

21:43.269 --> 21:44.737
If they are,
it's a good sign.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.573
Means they don't
have him.

21:47.573 --> 21:49.308
At least, not yet.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.245
The Catskills,
really?

21:53.245 --> 21:55.414
The boy was seen at
the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

21:55.414 --> 21:56.916
He boarded
a Greyhound for --

21:56.916 --> 21:58.184
For Tannersville,
New York?

21:58.184 --> 21:59.685
We're looking
for him there.

21:59.685 --> 22:01.520
Well,
something's happened.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.255
A 10-year-old boy
doesn't just leave home

22:03.255 --> 22:04.957
in the middle
of the night.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.792
His parents don't just
lie to the police.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.094
Have we heard
from Autumn Cox?
Not yet,

22:09.094 --> 22:12.064
but she's been released
by the NYPD, per your order.

22:12.064 --> 22:14.433
She's a smart woman.
She'll call.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.836
Keep looking
for the parents,

22:16.836 --> 22:18.837
but our focus
is the boy.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.306
Whatever it takes.

22:22.608 --> 22:25.711
Woman: Director,
we've located the boy.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.387
Grace: I mean,
it looks rustic.

22:35.387 --> 22:38.090
There's a stone fireplace,
a lantern.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.826
So, we're looking for
a cabin in the woods.

22:40.826 --> 22:43.462
We need the drawing
that was torn out of the book,

22:43.462 --> 22:44.864
the exterior.

22:48.634 --> 22:52.771
Grace, behind us.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.510
Are they following us?

23:03.315 --> 23:06.552
Hang on.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.229
How are we
supposed to find Cal?

23:17.229 --> 23:18.897
We're just gonna lead them
right to him.

24:20.392 --> 24:23.295
About time.
Where are you?

24:23.295 --> 24:26.665
I know
where Cal Stone is.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.114
Grace.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.817
Grace: They're leaving.
Where are they going?

24:44.817 --> 24:46.518
Maybe they found him.

25:35.467 --> 25:39.004
No one.
He's not here.

25:43.308 --> 25:45.477
Michaela: Thanks for
throwing them off the scent.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.513
You did
the right thing, Autumn.

25:47.513 --> 25:49.681
I hope so.

25:49.681 --> 25:51.984
Autumn,
you need to be careful.

25:51.984 --> 25:55.988
She could easily be sending
someone after you.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.691
So I -- I guess
I should get going.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.132
Your daughter.

26:08.934 --> 26:10.903
The name and address

26:10.903 --> 26:13.939
of your daughter's
adoptive family.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.311
I know what it's like
to come back

26:19.311 --> 26:22.448
and feel like
you've lost everything,

26:22.448 --> 26:25.684
but bottoming out,
it's a good thing.

26:25.684 --> 26:30.022
The only place you can go now
is up.

26:30.022 --> 26:35.961
Autumn, do you have
something for me?

26:40.399 --> 26:42.601
Cal drew my daughter.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.070
That's why
I ripped it out.

26:45.070 --> 26:49.842
I told no one, but somehow
Cal knew my daughter existed.

26:49.842 --> 26:53.011
He even drew
her crazy red hair.

26:54.813 --> 26:59.418
I'm so sorry...
for everything.

27:01.587 --> 27:03.956
Good luck.

27:12.831 --> 27:14.967
That's it.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.803
That's the key
to finding Cal.

27:25.544 --> 27:29.281
That's Mick.
Hey, Mick.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.649
Hey, did you
get the photo?

27:30.649 --> 27:31.917
Grace:
Oh, thank God.

27:31.917 --> 27:33.919
Yeah, we're looking at it
right now.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.821
I mean,
it's a cabin in the woods.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.757
There's no mailbox,
no street number.

27:38.757 --> 27:39.958
There's got
to be something.

27:39.958 --> 27:41.627
Okay,
focus on the details.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.328
The trees -- maybe they're
visible from the road.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.830
Wait.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.999
What's that in the distance
behind the cabin?

27:46.999 --> 27:48.433
On the top
of the hill?

27:48.433 --> 27:50.102
Yeah, it's a structure
of some kind.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.870
I think
it's a radio tower.
Radio tower.

27:51.870 --> 27:54.106
Ben,
I think we saw one.

27:55.574 --> 27:57.676
Yeah,
we passed it earlier.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.245
Hey, you guys, I'm coming up
there. Wait for me, all right?

28:00.245 --> 28:02.381
If you find the cabin,
do not go in there.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.715
Wait for me,
all right?

28:03.715 --> 28:05.017
Just because
we threw them off the trail

28:05.017 --> 28:06.985
doesn't mean
they won't find him.

28:06.985 --> 28:09.388
We'll call if we can.

28:13.425 --> 28:17.262
Hey, I need you
to stay at the precinct.

28:17.262 --> 28:20.265
What? Why?

28:20.265 --> 28:22.701
Because I might need you
to research something
or coordinate.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.870
I just --
And I think
I should be with you, Mick.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.372
You're looking for a missing
kid. The more cops, the better.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.441
And like you said,
it could be dangerous.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.124
You okay?

28:46.124 --> 28:47.993
Hey, Mick.

28:47.993 --> 28:49.628
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:49.628 --> 28:51.530
Was that a calling?

28:51.530 --> 28:53.699
I'm not sure.

28:54.933 --> 28:58.437
Jared, I need to go up there
on my own.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.539
You've been so helpful,
and I am so grateful.

29:00.539 --> 29:01.607
Trust me.

29:01.607 --> 29:04.343
I can't explain why.
I just do.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.412
I know. I'm sorry.
I need you to stay.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.643
I'm pretty sure
it was around here.

29:37.643 --> 29:39.277
So which way,
right or left?

29:39.277 --> 29:40.879
I don't know.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.514
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.650
I want to say left,
but if I'm wrong,

29:44.650 --> 29:46.685
then we're gonna waste time
driving through these hills.

29:46.685 --> 29:48.687
Well, let's look at
the drawing again. Maybe...

29:50.088 --> 29:52.624
What?
What is it?

29:52.624 --> 29:54.259
Right or left?

29:54.259 --> 29:55.694
"I left."

30:00.032 --> 30:01.299
What?

30:01.299 --> 30:04.202
It's not an "I."
I-I-It's a map.

30:04.202 --> 30:06.304
Look. Look, look.
Look at this.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.106
That's the corner
behind us,

30:08.106 --> 30:10.042
and now we're facing
this junction.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.510
"Left" means "turn left."

30:11.510 --> 30:13.578
Cal's telling us
how to find him.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.068
Grace:
Oh, my God.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.637
Ben, this is it.

30:46.611 --> 30:49.414
Ben:
Looks deserted.

30:49.414 --> 30:54.286
Stump, truck,
and there's the radio tower.

30:56.988 --> 30:58.323
We're not waiting
for Michaela.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.892
No kidding.
Let's go.

31:00.892 --> 31:02.194
Cal?

31:05.997 --> 31:08.900
Cal.
He's here.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.168
Cal!

31:12.003 --> 31:15.674
Cal.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.542
Cal.
Cal, oh, my God.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.478
Oh, we were
so worried.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.280
Are you okay?

31:22.280 --> 31:23.281
You're alone?

31:23.281 --> 31:24.583
Yeah.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.384
Is there
anyone else here?

31:26.384 --> 31:27.586
Okay.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.622
Sweetie,
how -- how did you get here?

31:30.622 --> 31:32.224
I took a bus
to Tannersville,

31:32.224 --> 31:34.793
got a ride with Max
from the gas station,

31:34.793 --> 31:36.762
then I walked up
from the road.

31:36.762 --> 31:38.864
I don't understand.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.366
Why?
Why did you do this?

31:41.366 --> 31:43.201
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

31:43.201 --> 31:44.903
It's okay.
It's okay.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.239
Cal, sweetie, we're gonna
take you home now, okay?

31:47.239 --> 31:49.574
We're gonna go home.
I can't leave.
He's coming.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.676
Cal.
He's almost here.

31:51.676 --> 31:53.445
Who is?
Who's almost here?

31:53.445 --> 31:56.014
What are you
talking about?

31:56.014 --> 31:58.016
Did you get
a calling, buddy,

31:58.016 --> 32:00.852
that told you
to come here?

32:02.354 --> 32:05.690
Okay.

32:05.690 --> 32:06.892
Ben.

32:06.892 --> 32:09.227
To the back room.
Dad!

32:09.227 --> 32:10.595
No, Dad, wait!

32:14.399 --> 32:16.334
It's him! It's him!
Don't hurt him!

32:32.317 --> 32:33.852
Stay there.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.795
He's freezing cold.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.530
We got to get
these wet clothes off

32:45.530 --> 32:46.932
and get
a fire going.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.767
Cal, see if you can find
a blanket or something.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.001
We got
to keep him warm.

32:50.001 --> 32:52.470
I have a sleeping bag
in my backpack.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.612
You brought all this
from home?

33:00.612 --> 33:02.447
There's bandages, too.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.916
You somehow knew
he would need all of this?

33:04.916 --> 33:06.284
I knew
I had to help.

33:06.284 --> 33:08.787
Well, you did.
You saved his life.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.089
Any idea who he is?

33:14.626 --> 33:16.261
Oh, honey,
look at you.

33:16.261 --> 33:19.497
You're half-asleep already.
Come on.

33:19.497 --> 33:22.534
Come lay down,
sweetie.

33:28.406 --> 33:31.109
All right, hang in there.

33:41.953 --> 33:44.890
We had the parents,
but we lost them.

33:44.890 --> 33:47.792
Our asset gave us
false information.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.028
The Major:
Autumn? Did she?

33:50.028 --> 33:51.663
I'm surprised.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.598
We'll track her down.

33:53.598 --> 33:54.866
Leave her be.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.336
We'll find her
when we need her.

33:58.336 --> 34:01.106
And we don't know why
the boy went upstate?

34:01.106 --> 34:04.042
No, ma'am.
We can widen the search.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.144
We assume
the parents found him.

34:06.144 --> 34:08.580
They'll come back home
before long.

34:08.580 --> 34:12.217
If I've learned anything
running point for 22 years,

34:12.217 --> 34:14.853
there's no need
to chase the enigma

34:14.853 --> 34:17.522
when it lives
right in our backyard.

34:17.522 --> 34:20.558
We bide our time.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.727
Yes, Major.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.966
I do like
the view.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.167
It's spectacular.

34:29.167 --> 34:31.169
Anything that's happening
in this city,

34:31.169 --> 34:32.404
you'll know about it.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.073
So, are you relocating, then,
to New York?

34:35.073 --> 34:39.311
It looks like I'll be spending
some time here, yes.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.090
Hey,
I talked to Olive.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.293
She sends Cal her love
and a punch on the arm.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.896
I don't even know
where to start.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.764
Like,
who is this guy?

34:59.764 --> 35:00.999
O-Okay, sure.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.300
Let's start there.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.869
Your guess
is as good as mine.

35:04.869 --> 35:06.805
He wasn't
on the plane?

35:06.805 --> 35:08.406
No.

35:08.406 --> 35:10.408
Well, how can
you be certain?

35:10.408 --> 35:12.110
There were
over 190 passengers.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.778
Because I know
the name and face

35:13.778 --> 35:15.013
of every single one
of them.

35:15.013 --> 35:17.882
He's not
on the manifest.

35:17.882 --> 35:19.317
He's somehow connected.

35:19.317 --> 35:21.686
Otherwise, Cal wouldn't have
made those drawings

35:21.686 --> 35:22.921
or come
all the way up here.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.489
Connected how?

35:24.489 --> 35:26.224
You have no idea?

35:26.224 --> 35:28.693
Zero.

35:28.693 --> 35:29.894
I don't know
what he wants,

35:29.894 --> 35:32.330
if we can trust him.

35:33.965 --> 35:40.105
The callings are incredibly,
frustratingly vague.

35:40.105 --> 35:41.606
You know,
the best we can do

35:41.606 --> 35:44.809
is guess what they mean,
what they want us to do.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.845
That's not
exactly reassuring.

35:46.845 --> 35:49.147
Yeah,
believe me.

35:49.147 --> 35:52.751
Okay,
so what now?

35:52.751 --> 35:56.588
We watch, listen,

35:56.588 --> 35:58.823
because whatever the reason
Cal came up here,

35:58.823 --> 36:00.625
whoever this guy is...

36:00.625 --> 36:02.160
It's important.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.995
The question is,

36:03.995 --> 36:08.333
are we supposed to help him
or stop him?

36:12.637 --> 36:14.339
I know.
I'm sorry.

36:14.339 --> 36:17.642
This is
what it's been like.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.347
I'm sorry.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.417
You were trying
to take care of us,

36:25.417 --> 36:29.754
all of us,
all this time.

36:29.754 --> 36:32.223
I didn't see it.

36:32.223 --> 36:37.562
I didn't
let you see it.

36:37.562 --> 36:39.931
I just wish
you'd told me, Ben,

36:39.931 --> 36:42.200
everything
from the beginning.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.502
It should never have even been
a question.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.306
Even if
it put you at risk?

36:48.306 --> 36:49.674
Even then.

36:49.674 --> 36:53.511
From now on,
everything.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.082
Everything.

37:05.757 --> 37:06.958
Michaela:
Where's Cal?

37:06.958 --> 37:08.760
Ben:
He's sleeping.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.295
Finally.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.297
I, uh,
took the scenic route

37:12.297 --> 37:14.599
after I saw government SUVs
heading back to the city.

37:14.599 --> 37:16.768
Guess the Major
called off the dogs.

37:16.768 --> 37:17.969
Grace:
He's out of it.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.504
He collapsed
as soon as he arrived.

37:19.504 --> 37:20.839
And no I.D.

37:20.839 --> 37:25.076
We don't know who he is
or why Cal came to meet him.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.055
Is this
what he was wearing?

37:37.055 --> 37:39.524
Yeah.

37:39.524 --> 37:41.993
The visions
that I've been having.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.394
The blizzard?

37:43.394 --> 37:45.797
It's the same jacket.
Ben, it's -- it's him.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.309
You think
we're okay here?

37:58.309 --> 38:01.079
I mean, how long before we're
back in the Major's sights?

38:01.079 --> 38:02.680
I think
we've got some time.

38:02.680 --> 38:07.118
The Major has to regroup,
but we should keep watch.

38:08.586 --> 38:10.788
Ben, we're taking a risk.
We should get him checked.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.525
No, I am not rushing him off
to some hospital.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.560
The calling,
or whatever the hell it is,

38:15.560 --> 38:17.195
has gone
to some pretty extreme lengths

38:17.195 --> 38:18.596
to put us back in a room
with him.

38:18.596 --> 38:20.131
I want to know why.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.566
Why is he
in your visions?

38:21.566 --> 38:24.202
Why is my son
coming all this way?
Okay, calm down.

38:24.202 --> 38:25.970
I'm texting with Saanvi.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.272
He's hypothermic.

38:27.272 --> 38:29.374
We're treating it.
He's gonna pull through.

38:29.374 --> 38:31.776
If he becomes agitated
or unresponsive,

38:31.776 --> 38:33.678
we're to call 911.

38:36.781 --> 38:38.850
So, Cal?

38:38.850 --> 38:41.152
It's just like when
he appeared at the warehouse.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.520
He couldn't
tell us anything.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.589
He just somehow knew
to come here

38:44.589 --> 38:48.693
and apparently bring
all the necessary supplies.

38:48.693 --> 38:52.664
The Major knows about Cal,
about his abilities.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.866
Autumn told her.

38:56.601 --> 38:58.436
You.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.574
You're her.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.811
Michaela?

39:18.089 --> 39:19.424
I was hiking,

39:19.424 --> 39:24.963
and there was --
there was a blizzard.

39:24.963 --> 39:29.300
I fell in some sort of, like,
a -- like, some kind of cave.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.369
I didn't have much.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.204
I was burning
literally everything I had

39:33.204 --> 39:35.607
trying to stay warm.

39:35.607 --> 39:40.778
And I had
this magazine.

39:40.778 --> 39:43.114
And on the final page,

39:43.114 --> 39:47.418
it was like you were giving me
your strength,

39:47.418 --> 39:49.587
willing me to live.

40:05.536 --> 40:08.840
How is it possible
you're here?

40:10.241 --> 40:12.477
Uh...
what's your name?

40:12.477 --> 40:13.611
Zeke.

40:13.611 --> 40:18.983
Okay, Zeke,
so you waited it out,

40:18.983 --> 40:20.451
the blizzard?

40:20.451 --> 40:24.555
I got snowed in,
packed.

40:24.555 --> 40:29.460
I couldn't feel my hands
or my feet, but I just --

40:29.460 --> 40:33.197
I just
kept picturing your face.

40:33.197 --> 40:35.266
And, I mean,
it doesn't make sense.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.801
You were --
You were dead.

40:36.801 --> 40:41.072
But I just kept repeating
over and over,

40:41.072 --> 40:42.974
right out loud --
"Find her."

40:44.375 --> 40:46.144
How did you...?

40:46.144 --> 40:48.913
I had a vision
of you.

40:48.913 --> 40:51.215
I heard you.
I-I saw you.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.253
I don't understand
what's happening.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.655
You were on that plane.
You died.

40:57.655 --> 41:00.658
How can you be here?

41:00.658 --> 41:01.926
We came back.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.695
It was all over the news.
You would've had to...

41:06.864 --> 41:11.102
Zeke, how long
have you been out here?

41:11.102 --> 41:13.071
About two weeks.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.039
I left at the beginning
of December.

41:15.039 --> 41:17.041
What year?
What?

41:17.041 --> 41:18.943
What year
did you leave?

41:18.943 --> 41:21.312
What d--
This year.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.015
Can I see that?

41:46.137 --> 41:49.807
Zeke, what year?

41:49.807 --> 41:52.243
2017.

41:52.243 --> 41:55.780
Guys,
what the hell?

41:55.780 --> 41:58.116
Zeke,
it's 2018.

42:00.885 --> 42:03.888
You went on your hike
one year ago.

42:03.888 --> 42:06.024
That's impossible.

42:10.495 --> 42:12.363
It's been two weeks.
