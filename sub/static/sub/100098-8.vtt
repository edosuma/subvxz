WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.231
If they show up and we're gone,
my family's dead.

00:03.320 --> 00:05.994
<i>My life puts everyone
I love in danger.</i>

00:09.080 --> 00:11.311
<i>My instructions were
to find your brother.</i>

00:11.400 --> 00:14.320
Well, in that case, my phone's not gonna
do you any good. I just wiped it.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.235
Do you think it's possible

00:22.320 --> 00:25.119
Mr. Robot is the reason
why you can't remember?

00:25.200 --> 00:26.759
You didn't exist
when I was a kid...

00:26.880 --> 00:27.880
<i>Did you?</i>

00:27.960 --> 00:30.395
Do not do this to him!
He's not supposed to know!

00:30.880 --> 00:32.560
<i>Why were you afraid
of your father?</i>

00:32.640 --> 00:35.360
Were you afraid he was going
to ask you to do something

00:35.440 --> 00:36.794
you didn't want to do?

00:37.320 --> 00:38.320
Yes.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.120
This was our runaway hideout
He always came here.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.319
Remember, somehow we ended up
at the Queens Museum instead?

00:45.440 --> 00:47.909
When you're eight,
running away can be fun.

00:55.960 --> 00:59.351
Twenty, 19...

01:00.760 --> 01:02.080
...eighteen,

01:03.000 --> 01:04.069
seventeen,

01:05.040 --> 01:06.394
sixteen,

01:07.440 --> 01:08.635
fifteen,

01:10.000 --> 01:11.116
fourteen...

01:12.400 --> 01:13.595
...thirteen,

01:14.840 --> 01:16.115
twelve, eleven, ten.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.435
What?

02:26.400 --> 02:27.959
Who cares what I'm doing?

02:28.040 --> 02:30.236
It's none of your business.
Don't worry about it.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.349
I gotta do this.
It's gonna help us.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.760
Just trust me.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.077
Ready or not!
Prepare to die!

02:58.160 --> 03:01.756
Angela's not gonna find us here.
Just give me a sec.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.512
I heard that.
You suck at this game.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.954
I see you, butthead.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.316
I killed him.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.110
I killed him.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.519
Okay, Elliot,
we need to call the police.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.075
His phone's ringing.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.309
Oh, God. The others
are coming back.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.155
Did you hear me? We're not safe
in this place anymore.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.313
Elliot, you gotta
listen to me.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.120
Listen to me. You gotta
listen to me, Elliot. We have to go.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.760
Elliot, we have to go.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.639
We have to leave, Elliot.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.994
Elliot?

04:53.320 --> 04:54.754
Elliot?

04:56.040 --> 04:57.474
Elliot, look at me.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.875
Elliot. Elliot.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.314
Elliot.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.680
Elliot!

05:06.800 --> 05:08.800
<i>Yo. Make it plain.</i>

05:09.680 --> 05:12.434
Yo, he's not picking up, bro.
And I gotta fucking piss.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.435
Man, I told you hit the Arby's
up around the way, bro.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.035
I'm not sitting on no dirty-ass
toilet seat, bro.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.553
You know they be getting
hep C up they ass

05:20.640 --> 05:22.680
and they pores and shit
sitting on that toilet, bro.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.514
Man, I'm going
inside, bro.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.239
Yo. Yo.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.232
Boss told us
stay till he done, son.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.073
Oh. I'm gonna be quiet.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.550
Yo, you don't wanna know
what's going on up there?

05:34.800 --> 05:35.800
Come on, bro.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.480
That was some cliffhanger shit
they left us on.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.671
Yeah, man.
Come on.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.351
Yo, Arby's
be delicious, though.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.513
Got that 5 for $5.

05:52.920 --> 05:58.075
Shit's the fiscally
responsible menu.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.311
Man, I don't
care about fiscally.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.469
When it come to food,
I'm treating myself. Period.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.960
Yo, you ever had
Momofuku?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.240
Nah, son.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.800
Yeah, you probably
can't afford that.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.719
I ain't never
had no Fuku, bro.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.473
I don't even know
what that shit mean.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.640
You know what
that shit mean?

06:22.680 --> 06:23.955
What the fuck?

06:24.400 --> 06:27.757
- Oh, shit, bro!
- What the fuck? What the fuck?

06:28.400 --> 06:29.470
What the...

06:40.200 --> 06:41.714
What are you
doing, dummy?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.559
Grab his wallet,
let's go.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.360
Fuck.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.073
Okay, come on, Elliot.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.314
We're gonna just
get in this taxi.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
It's gonna be
just fine.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.075
Thank you, just hold it.
Come on, let's go.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.880
We gotta go. We gotta go.
It's okay, I got you.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.429
There you go.
All right.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.638
<i>... Cares Program
helps ensure families in need...</i>

07:05.720 --> 07:07.296
- Okay.
<i>- ...receive much-needed assistance...</i>

07:07.320 --> 07:09.840
Take us to
the nearest police station, please.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.238
The nearest
police station.

07:17.760 --> 07:22.755
<i>From everyone here at the E Corp family
to you and yours, we're wishing you</i>

07:22.840 --> 07:24.320
<i>a happy holiday season.</i>

07:25.920 --> 07:26.920
Slapjack!

07:27.080 --> 07:28.753
Nuh-uh, my hand
was there first.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.752
Doesn't matter.
I called it first, doofus.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.593
Don't call me
doofus, dingus.

07:32.720 --> 07:36.350
All right, all right, official ruling.
You each get half the cards.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.440
But Aunt Trudie...

07:37.560 --> 07:39.392
No buts.
I am the referee.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.120
That's not fair.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.795
Well, that's the way it's gotta be.
We're splitting the baby.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.232
You can split
my dick hole!

07:46.360 --> 07:49.398
Thomas Alan DiPierro,
you apologize this instant.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.918
- But, Mom.
- Now, young man. Or I'm taking your iPad.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.278
Sorry, Aunt Trudie.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.678
Now you go take a time-out
in the living room

07:58.760 --> 08:00.240
and think about
what you said.

08:06.760 --> 08:09.275
Stupid idiot. Think you can
tell me what to do.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.919
What was that,
young man?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Nothing.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.656
I'm so embarrassed. I don't know
where he got that language from.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.875
His father.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.680
Probably letting him watch <i>SummerSlam</i>
again, the son of a bitch.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.471
- Momma?
- Not now, Tommy.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.309
- Momma!
- I said not now, Tommy!

08:43.400 --> 08:45.471
Momma! Momma!

09:10.680 --> 09:13.718
Did you know that cities
were created by lightning?

09:17.720 --> 09:18.836
It's true.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.840
I heard it on a podcast.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.795
Villages used to be
made of organic materials.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.156
Mostly mud and sticks.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.796
Then one night
about 12,000 years ago,

09:31.880 --> 09:35.191
a bolt of lightning
hit a chunk of limestone,

09:37.440 --> 09:41.116
which formed a powder
that we now know as...

09:42.360 --> 09:43.360
Anyone?

09:49.880 --> 09:50.880
Cement?

09:53.920 --> 09:57.960
Very smart, Darlene.
You're absolutely right.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.816
Just think what a different
world it would be

10:00.840 --> 10:05.039
if that lightning had struck
a tree or a puppy instead.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.760
This remarkable city you see
before you would be nothing

10:08.800 --> 10:11.110
but sticks and leaves

10:12.960 --> 10:13.960
and puppy shit.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.758
But the lightning hit stone,
and the people of Turkey

10:17.840 --> 10:22.756
awoke to find that they were
in the cradle of modern civilization.

10:24.320 --> 10:29.315
All from one perfect moment
of violent convergence.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.955
Isn't it wonderful?

10:31.400 --> 10:33.198
Destruction can be
so productive.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.320
Her phone is useless.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.393
There's nothing here.
She wiped it clean.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.511
I had hoped
for better news.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.831
I told you, you were
wasting your time.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.713
Looks like you're just going to have
to restore your phone for us yourself.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.560
Eat shit.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.640
Then die.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.314
A nasty mouth on this one.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.680
She doesn't know anything.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.080
And even if she did,
she wouldn't give her brother up.

11:08.760 --> 11:09.760
Trust me.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.913
Well, I wish I could, Dominique.
But you failed me, remember?

11:16.040 --> 11:17.656
Of course, I always held out
hope that you would

11:17.680 --> 11:19.240
rise to the occasion
when the time came.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.430
But in the back of my mind,

11:20.520 --> 11:22.716
I always knew you'd never be
able to see it through.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.874
Why, because
I'm not a murderer?

11:27.760 --> 11:31.231
You work for the federal government
of the United States of America.

11:31.680 --> 11:33.717
What, are you
trying to be funny?

11:34.760 --> 11:37.992
No, what I meant was, is we all know
how much you care about Darlene.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.515
What the hell
are you talking about?

11:45.640 --> 11:47.359
Well, you know,

11:47.840 --> 11:49.797
Ms. Alderson's
interrogation video?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.313
The one you
pleasure yourself to

11:54.520 --> 11:55.749
in private.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.279
I mean, all that
excess energy may be

11:59.360 --> 12:01.136
the reason you can't
get any sleep, Dominique.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.231
But, in any case,
it's pretty strong evidence

12:03.320 --> 12:06.154
of your affection for Ms. Alderson,
wouldn't you say?

12:15.760 --> 12:16.955
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.113
Did she not know?

12:27.040 --> 12:28.269
Ah...

12:28.880 --> 12:32.271
That is
embarrassing,

12:32.800 --> 12:34.871
um, I apologize.

12:35.880 --> 12:36.880
But,

12:38.600 --> 12:40.114
while we're at it,

12:42.400 --> 12:45.871
what did happen
between the two of you?

12:46.840 --> 12:47.840
I mean,

12:48.160 --> 12:52.200
it just all seemed quite dramatic.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.071
We fucked.
End of story.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.720
Mmm...

13:04.480 --> 13:05.834
Come on, now.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.833
I have a feeling there's a lot more
to this relationship than just that.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.150
Just sex.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.636
Sorry to disappoint you.

13:17.960 --> 13:22.159
I don't believe you,
so no worries there.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.315
Disappointment averted.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.952
Look, cunt stick,

13:34.080 --> 13:35.480
I don't know what
you're driving at,

13:35.560 --> 13:37.760
but there is no way I'm giving up
my brother.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.471
So, whatever
you're gonna do to me,

13:41.560 --> 13:43.233
you might as well
make it fast.

13:50.920 --> 13:51.920
Okay.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
No, no, no.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.430
- Dom.
- I wouldn't take it out if I were you.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.520
Dom!

14:02.600 --> 14:06.071
I am not a doctor, but I am
99% sure I punctured a lung.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.191
Yeah, that wheezing sound is her chest
cavity filling up with air,

14:12.640 --> 14:14.472
slowly compressing
her lung.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.000
If you pull it out now,
it'll just supercharge the process.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.990
She's got about 15 minutes before
she goes into full cardiac arrest

14:22.080 --> 14:23.992
or drowns in her own blood.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.474
Maybe longer, since Dominique's
such a fighter.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.793
What was the fucking point?
She has nothing to do with this.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.896
You said you would never give up your brother.
I simply thought this would be

14:33.920 --> 14:36.071
the most expeditious way
to break our stalemate.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.674
You give us what we want,

14:37.760 --> 14:41.117
we'll get Dominique
the care she so urgently needs.

14:42.360 --> 14:45.558
Or she'll die here, and I'll just have
to get it out of you some other way.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.029
Does that make sense?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.112
Elliot, you have
to come in with me.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.634
I can't do this.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.113
- I can't do it.
- Okay.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.440
Okay.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.593
What do people do?

15:25.560 --> 15:28.997
People like me, when they find out
about something like this?

15:31.480 --> 15:32.550
What can they do?

15:35.680 --> 15:37.751
They just try
to keep going.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.956
I should have fought him.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.800
If I would've...

15:53.880 --> 15:56.759
If I would've fought him,
maybe he would have stopped.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.116
Look at me.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.029
You were just a child.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.680
It wasn't up to you.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.120
I wanna go back
to forgetting.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.320
You never did forget.

16:21.640 --> 16:25.520
You may not realize it now, but you've
been struggling with this for years.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.990
The itch in the back
of your mind,

16:31.920 --> 16:33.274
the one you can't scratch?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.952
It was always there.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.832
You just didn't know
what it was.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.240
But now you do.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.154
He made me feel special.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.519
You are special.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.076
And what he did, it's not gonna take
that away from you.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.078
You will
survive this, Elliot.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.997
Call you tomorrow. Okay?

17:31.240 --> 17:34.438
No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I got you involved in any of this.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.398
You don't have to
take care of me anymore.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.913
I'd like to see
you again.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.278
You shouldn't go
through this alone.

17:55.480 --> 17:56.630
I know.

17:59.560 --> 18:00.596
I know.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.551
Promise me
you'll take care of yourself.

19:01.720 --> 19:02.756
Where are
we going?

19:10.800 --> 19:12.473
You sick fuck.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.236
She needs help.
She is dying over there.

19:16.680 --> 19:17.680
Oh, I'm aware.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.776
I want nothing more
than to get her to

19:19.800 --> 19:22.269
our medical team and have her
stitched up ASAP.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.396
Bullshit.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.993
Even if I gave you Elliot's location,
you would just let her die.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.878
That couldn't be
further from the truth.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.600
I'm not saying it's been
all blue skies with Dominique,

19:32.680 --> 19:35.036
but most of our moles have
some growing pains at first.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.240
And she is honest, loyal,
and she loves her family,

19:39.320 --> 19:41.835
all of which are qualities
that make her easy to control.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.598
No, Dominique has pluck.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.119
Losing her is
the last thing I want.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.277
Don't do it.
Don't tell her anything.

19:59.440 --> 20:06.392
See, I knew you two
shared a special connection.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.678
Even now, I can sense it.

20:09.760 --> 20:14.312
It's like a kind of
phantom electricity.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.555
I wonder, did Dominique ever
introduce you to her mother?

20:20.280 --> 20:21.509
Can't say she did.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.479
Oh, that's too bad.
Trudie is my favorite.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.199
You know, at first, I thought our
relationship would be purely tactical.

20:29.920 --> 20:33.709
Isolate the mark, ingratiate yourself,
find a pain point, you know, the usual.

20:34.640 --> 20:39.954
But then I got to know her,
and she's just so lovely and kind.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.319
Every other word out of her mouth
was about you, Dominique.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.995
She is so desperate
for you to find someone

20:46.640 --> 20:48.950
that she even looked to me
as a potential match.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.993
Can you imagine that?

20:52.760 --> 20:54.558
I was so flattered.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.916
You really have to admire a mother
who cares so much about her daughter's

21:00.000 --> 21:04.119
happiness that she's willing
to ignore certain red flags.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.270
Like what? The fact that
you're fucking insane?

21:07.360 --> 21:08.714
Mmm...

21:09.160 --> 21:10.435
You know,

21:10.880 --> 21:13.873
when I was in high school,
and my parents discovered my profound

21:14.000 --> 21:17.232
interest in taxidermy,
they had similar concerns.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.951
So, they had me undergo
a series of tests.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.680
But the results
were always underwhelming.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.757
No signs of
personality disorder.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.719
No unusual thought processes.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.752
All the doctors arrived
at the same conclusion.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.677
That I'm remarkably normal.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.314
You wouldn't be fucking
doing this if you were normal.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.313
- She can't breathe over there.
- Because of you.

21:50.680 --> 21:51.909
Let's remember that.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.912
I see this is causing
you a lot of grief.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.600
I didn't want that.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.797
I honestly thought
we would've moved on by now.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.672
Let me continue
to help you.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.040
What are you doing?

22:20.120 --> 22:22.680
I'm making a phone call to
our surveillance team outside

22:22.760 --> 22:24.160
your mother's house.

22:24.280 --> 22:25.280
Why?

22:25.360 --> 22:27.955
Because I'm going to start
killing your family members.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.952
Janice, please, don't.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.793
There are 13 of them.

22:31.880 --> 22:32.880
Janice!

22:33.400 --> 22:34.754
Four children.

22:35.760 --> 22:36.760
Eight adults.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.910
And Trudie.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.674
Don't! They're innocent.
Janice, please.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.275
I wonder, how many of them
have to die before you buckle?

22:46.320 --> 22:49.552
Please, Janice,
don't. Please!

22:50.480 --> 22:54.440
Do not do this.
Please, don't!

22:54.560 --> 22:55.560
Stop!

22:57.760 --> 22:58.955
Stop.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.960
Hand me my phone.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.393
I'll give you
my brother's location.

23:11.720 --> 23:15.111
I'll do whatever you want.
Just don't hurt them.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.752
Now look who has pluck.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.352
Why did you bring me here?
I don't get it.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.473
What are you trying to say?

24:42.560 --> 24:44.233
That I couldn't
stand up to him?

24:46.560 --> 24:48.517
That I ran away
here instead?

24:52.800 --> 24:55.872
I'm sorry I let him
do those things to you.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.315
I'm sorry
I didn't fight back.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.754
I'm sorry
I didn't protect you.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.514
I'm sorry
I didn't protect you.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.879
I am so fucking sorry!

25:18.000 --> 25:19.912
I'm sorry, okay?

25:25.400 --> 25:27.039
That isn't why
I brought you here.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.395
The sign.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.039
It used to be over there.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.200
Can you help me?

27:31.800 --> 27:33.951
This is the key
to my old bedroom.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.075
Why would I hide it here?

27:43.280 --> 27:45.078
It was Dad's key
to our room.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.518
We took it from him
so we could lock him out.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.117
We thought that
if he didn't have his key...

27:54.200 --> 27:56.669
He wouldn't be able to come in
and hurt us anymore?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.354
That's right.

28:07.120 --> 28:11.717
We hid the key so the monster
couldn't get to us.

28:20.040 --> 28:21.156
Don't you see?

28:23.280 --> 28:24.509
You're wrong.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.394
This wasn't running
away from him.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.920
I was fighting back.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.354
Location checks out.

28:49.480 --> 28:51.790
Alderson's phone was here,
but he's gone.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.280
Well, then where is he?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.400
<i>We're not sure yet.</i>

28:56.480 --> 28:58.119
<i>There's a dead body,
but it's not him.</i>

28:59.920 --> 29:01.149
Thank you.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.200
He wasn't there, Darlene.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.154
That doesn't make any sense.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.240
You're right,
it doesn't.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.875
I gave you access
to his location.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.270
We tracked him on my phone.
You saw it for yourself.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.319
You're gonna have to find
another way.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.794
There is no other way.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.800
If he wasn't there,
I don't know what to say. I mean...

29:35.240 --> 29:38.756
Look, my brother
doesn't tell me anything.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.673
Okay? If he's not with
his phone, it's because

29:43.800 --> 29:46.918
either something happened to him or
he doesn't want me to know where he is.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.959
- You're lying.
- Are you serious? I'm not lying.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.874
Yes, you are.
You are a filthy, lying liar.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.520
Oh, my God.

29:55.520 --> 29:56.795
She doesn't know.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.072
She doesn't know
where her brother is.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.275
She's telling the truth.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.875
Trust me, I know what it looks like
when she's lying.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.758
This isn't it.
It's a dead end.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.120
You know,
maybe you're right.

30:23.440 --> 30:25.033
Like my mother
used to say,

30:26.360 --> 30:29.751
"You can't juice the orange
when there's only the rind left."

30:31.760 --> 30:32.955
Give me my phone.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.200
What are you doing?

30:34.600 --> 30:37.320
I'm gonna have my men
gut Trudie like a trout.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.629
What? Why?

30:39.240 --> 30:41.630
Only way to confirm
or deny her statement.

30:41.720 --> 30:45.270
No! I gave you my brother's location.
I did what you wanted me to do.

30:45.360 --> 30:50.435
Mmm, correction. You gave me
his phone's location. Not his location.

30:50.520 --> 30:53.354
No, think about it, Janice.
My family's all you've got.

30:53.440 --> 30:54.476
If you kill them now...

30:54.560 --> 30:57.155
Then I'll have nothing left
to hang over your head.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.357
- No.
- I know.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.198
Looks like we both have
a lot riding on this, Dominique.

31:04.480 --> 31:09.475
You know, in poker, they would
call this an all-in move.

31:09.760 --> 31:15.233
You fucking moron. You are doing this
for no reason. I don't know where he is.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.913
And I'm calling your bluff.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.357
Please, Janice. Please.
We can work something out. Please.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.393
I'm sorry, Dominique.
I held off as long as I could.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.196
No answer.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.316
What?

32:35.840 --> 32:37.194
Your men.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.194
Not answering?

32:42.120 --> 32:46.558
And why exactly would you be
asking me that?

32:49.560 --> 32:51.074
Probably wanna ask him.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.234
Him? Who's him?

32:55.280 --> 32:59.354
Check my phone. He's probably
been trying to call me.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.756
<i>Dom, love. I've been
waiting for your call.</i>

33:41.960 --> 33:42.960
Hello?

33:43.080 --> 33:44.753
<i>Sorry for the delay,
but your plan worked.</i>

33:44.840 --> 33:47.230
<i>The license plates
you gave me checked out.</i>

33:47.360 --> 33:49.192
Don't worry,
everything's grand.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.273
I've got your family, and we're
on our way to the safe house.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.395
Who's this?

33:54.960 --> 33:56.030
Who the fuck is this?

33:56.280 --> 33:57.475
I asked you first.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.320
This is Deegan.
Who's this?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.116
<i>This is Janice.</i>

34:02.160 --> 34:05.471
Oh, yeah.
The Dark Army lass.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.677
<i>Listen, tell Dom
thanks for the technicality.</i>

34:07.760 --> 34:09.592
<i>We're square now,
et cetera, et cetera.</i>

34:09.679 --> 34:11.797
Oh, and I'm really sorry
about your boys.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.880
What do you mean?
What boys?

34:14.639 --> 34:16.552
The fellas guarding
Dom's mum's house.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.536
<i>I had to give 'em a bit of
the holy show back there.</i>

34:18.560 --> 34:19.960
<i>There weren't no other way.</i>

34:20.560 --> 34:23.234
What? Speak English.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.393
<i>I fucking killed 'em, dear.</i>

34:26.560 --> 34:28.040
<i>Shot 'em in the brains.</i>

34:28.560 --> 34:29.560
<i>With me gun.</i>

34:29.920 --> 34:31.639
<i>Don't worry, though,
they died with dignity.</i>

34:31.960 --> 34:33.792
<i>Well, a few of 'em
mighta shat themselves,</i>

34:33.880 --> 34:36.600
<i>but I believe that's what the Frenchies
call de rigeur, innit?</i>

34:37.040 --> 34:41.795
Mr. Deegan, I don't think
you've taken into account

34:41.920 --> 34:45.391
the primal forces
you are meddling with here.

34:46.480 --> 34:49.996
If you proceed down this path,
I will use every means

34:50.080 --> 34:52.356
at my disposal to
make sure that you never...

34:52.440 --> 34:53.496
<i>Yeah, yeah.
I heard it all before.</i>

34:53.520 --> 34:55.034
<i>Take a number,
et cetera and so forth.</i>

34:55.120 --> 34:58.557
<i>Now, you have yourself
a merry little Christmas.</i>

34:58.640 --> 35:00.632
<i>Ta-ta for now, ya flange!</i>

35:36.880 --> 35:39.315
You're okay.
You're okay.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.751
- We gotta get you up.
- Give me the phone.

35:58.440 --> 36:01.831
10-13, officer needs
immediate assistance.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.792
202 West 20th Street,
Apartment 16B.

36:12.640 --> 36:13.640
Go.

36:13.720 --> 36:14.720
What?

36:15.200 --> 36:16.793
You can't be here
when they arrive.

36:16.960 --> 36:20.590
No, I am not leaving you like this.
I don't give a shit if they arrest me...

36:20.680 --> 36:21.750
Don't be stupid.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.719
This is all my fault.
I did this to you.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.600
You wanna help me?

36:32.120 --> 36:35.352
Go find Elliot,
and take them down.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
Hey, kiddo.

37:47.320 --> 37:50.711
Sorry for the time-out.
We're almost good to go.

37:51.360 --> 37:55.479
Darlene's got everything we need
to grab the Deus Group phone numbers.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.555
And intercept
the two FA codes.

38:01.720 --> 38:06.237
I'm working on a script
to transfer all the money.

38:07.480 --> 38:10.757
But we don't have long,
the meeting's in an hour.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.880
That's not why
you let me back in, is it?

38:17.920 --> 38:19.036
You wanna talk about it?

38:25.920 --> 38:26.990
Mind if I talk, then?

38:37.520 --> 38:39.910
The only reason I'm here

38:42.600 --> 38:44.432
is to make sure
no one ever hurts you.

38:49.320 --> 38:52.518
That was supposed to be
your father's job, but he failed.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.396
He was too weak.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.795
But you.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.429
You were strong.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.315
You fought back

39:13.120 --> 39:14.474
the only way you could.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.599
You brought me here
to protect you

39:21.000 --> 39:22.036
from him.

39:28.840 --> 39:30.354
I tried to keep you safe.

39:32.160 --> 39:36.040
Only show you the memories when the two
of you were friends before...

39:43.840 --> 39:45.160
I thought I could

39:47.400 --> 39:50.199
store the truth,
so you'd never have to see it.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.240
Or feel it.

39:58.760 --> 39:59.760
Fact is,

40:02.960 --> 40:04.633
I didn't wanna
see it either.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.354
I made a terrible mistake.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.750
I was afraid.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.039
Afraid of what this
would do to you.

40:27.960 --> 40:28.960
To us.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.318
This was never
my secret to keep.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.318
And you deserved better than to live
in darkness for so long.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
I'm so sorry.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.954
I failed you, too.

41:12.840 --> 41:14.991
I understand
if you can't forgive me,

41:17.600 --> 41:19.398
or if you decide
to shut me out for good.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.592
Just as long as you know

41:33.480 --> 41:34.960
I am not your father.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.160
I never was.

41:49.560 --> 41:50.560
I know.

41:52.720 --> 41:53.995
You're nothing like him.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.320
That's why I created you.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.433
You're the father I needed,

42:05.800 --> 42:07.439
not the father I had.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.679
If I could have
stopped him,

42:26.120 --> 42:28.032
if I could go back in time,

42:28.520 --> 42:30.512
change everything
that happened to you,

42:32.200 --> 42:33.839
just make it all go away.

42:40.280 --> 42:41.953
Then I wouldn't be me.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.472
And I wouldn't have you.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.154
I don't know if I can go through
with the hack anymore.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.672
I don't know
if I can do anything.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.633
I can't do it.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.434
I can't do it.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.993
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.671
I can't do it.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.469
I can't do it.

44:15.600 --> 44:16.600
I can't do it.
