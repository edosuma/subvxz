Burt, hi.

01:20.146 --> 01:21.146
Oh, gosh,

01:21.147 --> 01:22.648
it's so good to see you.

01:26.152 --> 01:27.653
Oh, this is so nice.

01:29.656 --> 01:32.157
I've hardly seen you at all
since the kidnapping.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.158

Poor Danny.

I didn't know whether to go
to the funeral or not.

I was so upset.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.668
I wanted to pay my respects,

01:42.669 --> 01:44.169

it might upset you,

01:44.170 --> 01:46.171

so as upset as I already was,
I didn't go...

01:50.176 --> 01:51.176
But I did send fruit.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.678
Yeah, um, Sal...

01:52.679 --> 01:54.179
Did you get the basket of fruit?

01:54.180 --> 01:55.180
Yes, it was really very nice.

to know about the fruit?

No, no, about us.
I told her about us.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.696

Have you moved out?
What?

02:11.698 --> 02:13.699

we could just stay at my place

02:15.201 --> 02:16.702
You know what I would love?

02:16.703 --> 02:17.703
I would love a duplex.

Sally, please, not now.

02:24.711 --> 02:25.711
She understood.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.212
Well, good.

that I spent the night out,

That's Italian for "finished."

02:55.241 --> 02:57.242
Listen, I'm sorry, Sally.
I feel terrible.

02:57.243 --> 02:58.744
You feel terrible.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.245
Yeah, well,
since I feel terrible,

03:00.246 --> 03:01.246
you feel terrible,

03:01.247 --> 03:02.247
I think it would be terrible

03:02.248 --> 03:03.749
for us to see each other
every day

03:03.750 --> 03:05.250
and just keep on
feeling terrible,

03:05.251 --> 03:06.251
so what I think

03:06.252 --> 03:07.753
is you shouldn't work for me
anymore,

03:07.754 --> 03:09.755
and I can give you, like,
three months' pay.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.256
Three months' pay?

03:11.257 --> 03:12.758
Or four.
With four months' pay.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.259
You think you can buy me

03:14.260 --> 03:15.761

03:17.263 --> 03:18.263
Um, um...

03:18.264 --> 03:19.765
I'm not trying to buy you,
Sally.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.768
It's just that it's gonna
take you time to find a new job.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.269
Until then, you're gonna need
something to live on.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.271
Forget it.

03:26.272 --> 03:28.273
It won't do me any good
where I'm going.

03:28.274 --> 03:30.776
Oh, yeah, sure, I mean,
if you go someplace like Japan,

03:30.777 --> 03:33.779
it'll buy you, tops,
a cup of coffee, bowl of rice.

isn't it?

03:36.783 --> 03:40.786
All I need is enough
to buy a gun and bullets.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.788
Gun and bullets?

03:42.789 --> 03:44.790
No, Sally, murder is no answer.

03:44.791 --> 03:48.293
Don't worry, Burt, it's for me,

03:48.294 --> 03:50.295
so I can go home
and blow my brains out.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.147
Dear?

09:42.148 --> 09:44.649
Sure thing, darling.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.151
Well, I'd better be off.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.653
Yes, it's been nice
having you up.

09:50.656 --> 09:51.656
You expecting company?

09:51.657 --> 09:54.159
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.161
I was just wondering why you had

09:56.162 --> 09:58.163
the two extra place settings.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.165
The twins.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.668
Sure, the twins,
Candy and Randy.

10:04.670 --> 10:05.670
Well, I don't see them.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.172
They're in the outhouse.

10:11.177 --> 10:12.177
Together?

10:12.178 --> 10:13.678
Have to.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.180
Siamese twins.

10:20.686 --> 10:23.688
I see, I see.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.190
Candy and Randy

10:25.191 --> 10:27.192
will be sorry
to have missed you.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.695
They're both hoping
someday to be a policeman.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.198
Well...

10:33.199 --> 10:37.202
some other time...

10:37.203 --> 10:38.703
Now, you be sure
and keep this door locked,

10:38.704 --> 10:39.704
you hear?

10:39.705 --> 10:41.706
Yes, yes, pop in any time.

10:41.707 --> 10:43.708
Yeah, yeah, all right,
perhaps I will.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.210
Toodle-loo.

10:47.713 --> 10:48.713
Thank you.

10:48.714 --> 10:51.216
Hey, hey, you can come out now.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.219
Boy, that was close.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.220
Boy?

10:55.221 --> 10:57.222
Uh...

10:57.223 --> 10:59.224
Why don't we all
sit down and eat, huh?

10:59.225 --> 11:00.725
I thought for sure he had us

11:00.726 --> 11:03.228
with the extra
two place settings.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.730
Oh, all of this lying
made me hungry.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.232
Me too.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.913
Hey, aren't we going
to wait for the twins?

11:18.744 --> 11:20.245
Okay, a lump of butter...

11:20.246 --> 11:21.746
Okay.

11:21.747 --> 11:22.747
Now, watch out.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.249
Beat the egg yolks.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.251
I already beat the egg yolks.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.752
Well, do it again.
It's lumpy.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.254
I hate it when it's lumpy.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.256
Will you just read?
What's next?

11:31.257 --> 11:32.757
Uh, two tablespoons
of lemon juice.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.759
Elaine loved lemon juice.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.761
Oh, boy.
There he goes again.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.763
Come on, Bob. This
thing's starting to boil.

11:38.764 --> 11:39.764
What next?

11:39.765 --> 11:41.266
Okay. Stir in
the lemon juice

11:41.267 --> 11:42.767
under low heat...

11:42.768 --> 11:44.769
and continue cooking
until thick.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.271
It was thick 10 minutes ago.

11:46.272 --> 11:47.272
What do we do now?

11:47.273 --> 11:49.274
Throw it against the wall,
call me a taxi.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.276
This is garbage you got here.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.777
I can't eat this.

11:52.778 --> 11:55.280
I used to love
to watch Elaine eat.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.282
She ate like a princess.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.784
She ate like Seattle Slew.

11:59.785 --> 12:02.787
Chuck, get Bob out of here.

12:02.788 --> 12:03.788
Well, come on, Danny.

12:03.789 --> 12:06.291
I mean, Elaine's been dead
for two days.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.293
I mean, come on.
You've got to get over it.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.794
Enough is enough.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.796
Life goes on.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.798
Chuck...
Uh, let's eat out.

12:13.799 --> 12:14.799
Good idea.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.801
Yeah. You ruined
my breakfast.

12:16.802 --> 12:17.802
He ruined my appetite.

12:17.803 --> 12:22.807
You're a real downer, Danny.

12:22.808 --> 12:23.808
Breakfast?

12:23.809 --> 12:25.310
No, thanks.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.811
Danny, you haven't eaten
since the funeral.

12:26.812 --> 12:27.812
I know.

12:27.813 --> 12:29.314
You've got to eat.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.816
I keep asking myself why.

12:31.817 --> 12:32.817
Why?

12:32.818 --> 12:34.820
To keep up your strength.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.323
No. Why Elaine?
Why her?

12:38.324 --> 12:40.825
Danny, that question
has no answer.

12:40.826 --> 12:42.327
We all ask it.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.828
I mean, like,
when my son, Peter, died,

12:43.829 --> 12:45.830
I said, "Why him? Why Peter?"

12:45.831 --> 12:47.832
When your father died,
your mother said,

12:47.833 --> 12:48.833
"Why him? Why Johnny?"

12:48.834 --> 12:51.336
If it had been Mrs. Fogel
next door who had been shot,

12:51.337 --> 12:53.338
right now Mr. Fogel
would be saying, "Why her?

12:53.339 --> 12:54.839
Why Mrs. Fogel from next door?"

12:54.840 --> 12:57.842
I saw Mr. Fogel this morning
throwing out the garbage,

12:57.843 --> 13:00.345
and he said,
"Why her? Why Elaine?"

13:00.346 --> 13:02.347
Then he asked me if I shot her.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.849
Fogel's a jerk.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.851
Why would he think
that you shot her?

13:06.852 --> 13:08.853
Because he remembers
10 years ago

13:08.854 --> 13:11.356
when I killed that bird
with my BB gun.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.358
That was an accident.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.860
I know, I know,
but he's never forgotten it.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.862
Every time he sees me, he says,

13:17.863 --> 13:19.864
"What did you kill
today, Dan?"

13:19.865 --> 13:22.367
When I pull out of that driveway
this morning,

13:22.368 --> 13:23.868
I'm going to run over
his petunias.

13:23.869 --> 13:24.869
Burt, you are not.

13:24.870 --> 13:25.871
All right, so I'm not.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.376
I just can't believe it.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.877
I can't believe

13:32.878 --> 13:34.879
I'm never going to see Elaine
again.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.382
Oh, Danny,
there's no answer to any of it.

13:37.383 --> 13:39.384
It just hurts a lot,

13:39.385 --> 13:41.386
but eventually,
it'll hurt less and less.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.888
I know you'll never forget her,

13:43.889 --> 13:45.890
but someday, you'll be able
to think about her

13:45.891 --> 13:47.392
without hurting.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.394
It's just hard.

13:49.395 --> 13:50.395
I know.

13:50.396 --> 13:51.896
Hey, you know,

13:51.897 --> 13:53.898
doing things
would help, you know.

13:53.899 --> 13:55.400
I mean, keep your mind occupied.

13:55.401 --> 13:56.401
Oh, you mean like work?

13:56.402 --> 13:57.902
Work. Going out.
Seeing people.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.404
Anything that gets you involved.

13:59.405 --> 14:00.906
Shooting BBs at Fogel...

14:03.409 --> 14:04.909
You know what I'd like to do?

14:04.910 --> 14:07.412
Name it. I'll do it with you
if you want some company.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.414
You wouldn't want to do it.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.416
Danny, please. You're looking
at a guy who'll do anything.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.917
Come on, we'll do
anything you want.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.920
I want to find them.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.922
Let's go.
Thanks, Burt.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.424
Hey, find who?

14:19.425 --> 14:20.925
Who are we finding here?

14:20.926 --> 14:23.428
Them, the guys
that killed Elaine.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.430
That's what you
want to do today?

14:25.431 --> 14:27.932
I thought it was going to
be something like bowling.

14:27.933 --> 14:29.434
Danny, the police
are looking for them.

14:29.435 --> 14:30.435
It's their job.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.937
Ma, the police are looking
for a lot of people,

14:32.938 --> 14:34.939
so how hard can they look?

14:34.940 --> 14:36.941
No, forget it.
I want to do it myself.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.443
All right,
then I'm going with you.

14:38.444 --> 14:39.944
I'll keep you company.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.446
It could be very lonely looking.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.947
You sure?

14:42.948 --> 14:43.948
Absolutely.

14:43.949 --> 14:45.450
Great.
I'll get my jacket.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.451
Sure.

14:46.452 --> 14:47.452
Talk him out of it.

14:47.453 --> 14:48.953
Mary, I can't.
Look at him.

14:48.954 --> 14:49.954
Listen, don't worry.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.456
We'll go out for the day,
look around.

14:51.457 --> 14:52.957
We'll be lucky to find
a parking space,

14:52.958 --> 14:53.958
let alone a killer.

14:53.959 --> 14:54.960
Don't worry.

14:56.962 --> 14:59.464
All right, but
please be careful.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.966
All right.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.974
A gun? What
do we need a gun for?

15:09.975 --> 15:11.976
Burt, these guys are killers.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.478
Oh, then give it to me.

15:13.479 --> 15:14.979
Let me hold it.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.481
Do you know how to handle a gun?

15:16.482 --> 15:18.483
Danny, please. Do I know
how to handle a gun?

15:18.484 --> 15:20.485
I was practically born
with a gun in my hand.

15:20.486 --> 15:21.986
My grandfather owned
the shooting gallery

15:21.987 --> 15:22.987
on Coney Island.

15:22.988 --> 15:24.489
Do I know how to handle a gun?

15:24.490 --> 15:26.492
I held a gun
before I held a rattle.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.494
[SHOT FIRES]

15:30.496 --> 15:31.996
What happened?
I heard a shot.

15:31.997 --> 15:34.499
A shot?

15:34.500 --> 15:36.000
It's that toaster.

15:36.001 --> 15:40.505
I put a piece of rye bread in,
came out like:

15:40.506 --> 15:42.266
Better fix it.
You're going to kill somebody.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.019
[DOORBELL RINGS]

15:58.023 --> 16:00.024
[DOORBELL RINGS]

16:00.025 --> 16:01.526
You want me to get that?

16:08.033 --> 16:09.033
Hi.

16:09.034 --> 16:10.535
Hi.

16:10.536 --> 16:12.537
Benson, I've got some bad news.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.539
About Mr. Tate?

16:14.540 --> 16:15.540
Yeah.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.542
Is he...

16:17.543 --> 16:19.043
Yeah.

16:19.044 --> 16:20.545
When?

16:20.546 --> 16:22.548
Yesterday morning.

16:27.553 --> 16:28.553
Where are you going?

16:28.554 --> 16:30.054
Well, I think
I'd better tell her.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.556
I'll tell her.

16:31.557 --> 16:34.058
It's better if I tell her.
I've known her for a long time.

16:34.059 --> 16:36.060
Benson, I've had
a lot of practice doing this.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.063
I've been doing it for years.
Let me tell her.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.567
Mrs. Tate?

16:42.568 --> 16:44.069
JESSICA: Whoo-hoo.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.573
Now, break it to her gently.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.074
Just trust me.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.076
Yes, Benson?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.084
Detective Donohue...

17:00.085 --> 17:01.085
How nice to see you.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.086
Mrs. Tate.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.589
I was just going for a walk.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.592
Oh, it's such a gorgeous day.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.094
Would you like
to go with me, hmm?

17:10.095 --> 17:12.096
Maybe we could have a picnic.

17:12.097 --> 17:13.598
Mrs. Tate?
Hmm?

17:13.598 --> 17:15.099
We found this.

17:17.102 --> 17:18.603
It's Chester's.

17:18.604 --> 17:21.105
Benson, look, you remember.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.107
I gave it to Chester
for Christmas.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.608
Oh, golly.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.109
Look how it's falling apart.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.111
Yes.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.614
"Mock leather."

17:29.615 --> 17:30.615
See, I didn't know

17:30.616 --> 17:32.617
that that meant
it wasn't real leather.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.118
Mrs. Tate...

17:34.119 --> 17:35.620
I mean, after all,

17:35.621 --> 17:38.623
a mock turtleneck sweater
is still a sweater, right?

17:38.624 --> 17:40.124
Where did you get this?

17:40.125 --> 17:41.125
A little boy.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.627
A little boy?

17:42.628 --> 17:44.629
The boy in the mud.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.130
Mud?

17:46.131 --> 17:48.132
Mud from the flood.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.133
There was a flood?

17:49.134 --> 17:50.635
Well, sure.
When the dam broke.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.137
A dam broke?

17:53.138 --> 17:54.639
From the weight of the bridge.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.640
The bridge?

17:55.641 --> 17:57.141
Well, the bridge collapsed

17:57.142 --> 17:58.643
when the mountain fell on it.

17:58.644 --> 18:01.145
A mountain fell down?
A whole mountain?

18:01.146 --> 18:05.149
When the train blew up,
it jarred the mountain.

18:05.150 --> 18:06.651
What train?

18:06.652 --> 18:09.154
The train your husband
was killed on, Mrs. Tate.

18:19.665 --> 18:21.166
Mr. Tate's dead.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.674
Are you sure?

18:29.675 --> 18:31.676
You know, sometimes,
these things don't always...

18:31.677 --> 18:32.677
It was him.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.679
He was seen hopping a boxcar.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.180
We found his clothes
and that wallet.

18:36.181 --> 18:37.682
It was him.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.187
Are you all right?

18:44.690 --> 18:46.191
Can I get you anything?

18:48.193 --> 18:49.694
I don't know what.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.709
Chester's dead?

19:09.715 --> 19:11.215
He was right.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.717
Chester was right.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.219
About what?

19:16.221 --> 19:19.223
Oh, we...
we always used to argue,

19:19.224 --> 19:20.725
you know,

19:20.726 --> 19:22.727
about which one of us
would die first.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.729
Chester always said to me,

19:24.730 --> 19:27.231
"Jessica, I will be
the first one to die,

19:27.232 --> 19:30.235
therefore, I suggest you learn
how to balance the checkbook."

19:34.740 --> 19:36.241
He was right.

19:37.743 --> 19:39.244
He went first.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.247
Benson, I don't know anything

19:43.248 --> 19:45.249
about balancing the checkbook.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.252
I don't even know
where the checkbook is.

19:48.253 --> 19:50.755
I'll teach you how
to balance the checkbook.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.759
Chester...

19:56.762 --> 19:59.263
How could Chester die?

19:59.264 --> 20:01.766
There are so many things
he hasn't done yet.

20:03.769 --> 20:06.271
I mean, how could Chester die?

20:07.773 --> 20:09.274
Why don't you sit down?

20:10.776 --> 20:12.276
No, Benson, I can't.

20:12.277 --> 20:16.280
I mean, if I sat down now,
I'm afraid I would cry.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.283
Do you want to be alone?

20:20.786 --> 20:23.288
[SOBS] I am alone.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.348
What am I doing in Toledo?

21:24.349 --> 21:26.851
I've asked myself that
on numerous occasions.

21:26.852 --> 21:31.355
I seem to remember
being on a train.

21:31.356 --> 21:32.356
Right.

21:32.357 --> 21:33.357
What happened?

21:33.358 --> 21:35.359
I seen somebody toss you
out of a box car.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.862
That's right.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.864

Poof.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.885
Poof?

22:00.886 --> 22:02.887
That was a $400 suit.

22:02.888 --> 22:05.890
Poof?

22:05.891 --> 22:07.392
Wait a minute.

I remember.
