"The Tonight Show."

the rest of "The Kids
Tonight Show" is for kids.

to protect that kid vibe.

at the meat ball?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.858
We even play
your show's best games.

Except, don't take offense
to this,

04:21.361 --> 04:23.697

more kid-ified.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.932

- Okay.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.667
- Think of it like
"The Tonight Show,"

04:27.701 --> 04:29.302
but ten times messier--

04:29.336 --> 04:30.870
- Yup!
- Three times goofier--

04:30.904 --> 04:32.105
- Say it again.

the candy and just eat them?

05:20.186 --> 05:21.888
kids: No! No!
- Wait!

05:21.921 --> 05:24.057

- What should I grab?

05:24.057 --> 05:25.458
- No!
- Do not touch our buildings.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.094
Do not touch our buildings

touch the Olivia building.

- This is like a wonderland.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.573

You know, I liked performing.

06:33.626 --> 06:34.728
I liked telling jokes,
you know?

06:34.761 --> 06:36.629
I would get around
with my sister,

06:36.663 --> 06:38.898
and we would--
I would write jokes down

06:38.932 --> 06:40.600
and just perform, kind of,
for my parents

06:40.633 --> 06:42.769
and at parties, and then--
[applause]

06:42.802 --> 06:44.437
Yeah, and then I ended up here
where I am

06:44.471 --> 06:46.239

and making people laugh.

06:46.272 --> 06:48.074

- That is awesome!

like, so much music.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.513
So where did your passion
for music come from?

06:53.546 --> 06:56.082
- You know, my parents always
played the radio

06:56.116 --> 06:57.317
every single day.
- The radio.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.918
- Always played music
in the house.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.253
Yeah, the radio.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.022
It's a thing where--
oh, I don't need to explain.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.190
[laughter]
But, uh, yeah.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.792
But we always had
music going on

07:05.825 --> 07:07.694
and would always be singing
and dancing,

07:07.727 --> 07:10.096
and my dad would teach me
how to harmonize.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.297
Do you guys know
how to harmonize?

07:11.331 --> 07:13.099

What are three tips for being
a late night host?

07:44.698 --> 07:48.335
- Okay, one is,
always listen to your guests

07:48.368 --> 07:49.536

Two is have fun.

- Have the most fun 'cause,
honestly, we're doing this,

07:54.641 --> 07:56.276
and we have the best crowd.
kids: Yeah.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.644
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.
