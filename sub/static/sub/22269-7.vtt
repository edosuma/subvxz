WEBVTT

00:21.856 --> 00:23.649
Oh, my God.

00:28.446 --> 00:29.779
Not again...

00:31.407 --> 00:32.408
Marina!

00:33.409 --> 00:34.493
Marina!

00:40.374 --> 00:41.917
Marina!

00:43.377 --> 00:44.670
Marina!

00:47.506 --> 00:48.506
He's having a nightmare!

00:50.342 --> 00:51.718
Tell him to get rid of it!

00:51.719 --> 00:52.928
Tell him now!

00:59.685 --> 01:02.228
Make it go away!

01:02.229 --> 01:05.315
Or... dream it into something nice.

01:05.316 --> 01:06.900
Die, you son of a--

01:09.445 --> 01:10.403
♪ One-eyed, one-horned
flying Purple People Eater ♪

01:10.404 --> 01:13.239
Make. It. Go. Away!

01:13.240 --> 01:15.492
♪ One-eyed, one-horned
flying Purple People Eater ♪

02:01.914 --> 02:03.289
Shakes'n'rumble!

02:03.290 --> 02:04.625
Afeared!

02:11.799 --> 02:13.716
What? Are we...?

02:13.717 --> 02:14.884
We're not dead.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.219
I don't think we're dead.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.470
I can't believe that worked!

02:17.471 --> 02:18.972
Dirk, are you okay?

02:18.973 --> 02:20.516
Define "okay."

02:23.602 --> 02:24.854
Oh...

02:27.398 --> 02:29.941
Holy shit! Dirk!

02:29.942 --> 02:31.359
We're in Wendimoor!

02:31.360 --> 02:33.069
This is incredible!

02:33.070 --> 02:34.362
It's not Wendimoor.

02:34.363 --> 02:35.321
What?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.906
Yes, it is. Why?

02:36.907 --> 02:38.533
It was a portal, Todd, we could be anywhere.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.201
This could be Miami, for all you know.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.661
There's a giant magical moon in the sky.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.830
Do you see the giant magical moon?

02:43.831 --> 02:45.456
This is not Miami!

02:45.457 --> 02:47.000
Stop yelling about Miami, Todd.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.543
What other kind of castley fairyland

02:48.544 --> 02:49.752
could this possibly be?

02:49.753 --> 02:51.087
You're jumping
to extra-dimensional conclusions.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.213
<i>I'm</i> jumping--

02:52.214 --> 02:53.548
You went from Blackwing

02:53.549 --> 02:55.049
to the trunk of a car in Bergsberg--

02:55.050 --> 02:56.551
Again, domestic travel.

02:56.552 --> 02:59.762
Oh, my God, dude,
we are in another dimension.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.431
Let's go. If this is Miami,

03:01.432 --> 03:02.849
I'll buy you whatever drink they're known for.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.517
Where exactly do you think
you're going, Todd?

03:04.518 --> 03:07.353
What, pray tell, is your plan?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.397
The Boy is dead.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.524
I was to find The Boy, and I did,

03:11.525 --> 03:13.860
and I got him killed.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.071
Along with all those people at the hospital.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.032
That wasn't your fault.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.076
Suzie Boreton was looking for me.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.537
If I hadn't been there,
no one would've been hurt.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.580
You don't know that.

03:25.581 --> 03:26.581
Same with Blackwing.

03:26.582 --> 03:27.916
They're hunting me,

03:27.917 --> 03:29.792
and that man, Mr. Priest,

03:29.793 --> 03:31.127
I've met him before, Todd.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.795
He kills people.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.214
And we've had to leave Farah behind.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.048
Who knows what'll happen--

03:35.049 --> 03:35.924
Farah will be fine.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.425
But what if she's not?

03:37.426 --> 03:40.470
What if we lose her, and Tina, like Hobbs?

03:40.471 --> 03:43.973
You know, you're so obsessed
with finding your sister

03:43.974 --> 03:45.475
you are ignoring
the obvious facts

03:45.476 --> 03:46.726
right in front of you.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.144
And what are those?

03:48.145 --> 03:49.688
That all of this is my fault.

03:51.023 --> 03:53.525
Every move I make puts people in danger.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.822
Look, I get it.

03:59.823 --> 04:00.865
I'm scared too.

04:00.866 --> 04:01.991
I never said "scared."

04:01.992 --> 04:03.451
I said I get people killed,

04:03.452 --> 04:05.579
I leave a trail of dead people.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.082
The case is over.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.501
The boy is dead.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.753
What if Arnold isn't The Boy?

04:13.754 --> 04:16.589
What if The Boy is here in Wendimoor?

04:16.590 --> 04:17.966
You have to keep trying, Dirk.

04:17.967 --> 04:20.051
Without The Boy,
this whole world falls apart,

04:20.052 --> 04:22.345
and we're currently in it, so...

04:22.346 --> 04:23.930
Look, hey, what if I'm The Boy?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.432
You're not The Boy,

04:26.433 --> 04:28.768
you're just a guy named Todd
whose life I ruined.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.729
Can't you see it's all nonsense?

04:31.730 --> 04:35.275
I have no clue what's going on.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.194
What the hell does
a Purple People Eater

04:38.195 --> 04:39.487
have to do with an evil wizard,

04:39.488 --> 04:42.615
<i>and what has any of that
got to do with Mona Wilder?</i>

04:42.616 --> 04:44.910
How am I supposed
to put that together?

04:45.369 --> 04:48.246
How am I supposed to bring
The Boy to Wendimoor

04:48.247 --> 04:51.541
if I'm already in Wendimoor?

04:51.542 --> 04:53.501
I thought you said this was Miami.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.503
I have blown this,
like I blow everything!

04:55.504 --> 04:57.255
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

04:57.256 --> 04:59.091
And then I end up alone!

05:03.637 --> 05:04.638
Ha!

05:06.223 --> 05:07.223
I quit.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.683
W-- you what?

05:10.394 --> 05:12.353
I quit being a detective.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.939
Ha!

05:14.940 --> 05:17.358
You know, I'm just
going to sit right here

05:17.359 --> 05:19.319
and do nothing else.

05:19.320 --> 05:23.031
I will not be a participant
in any more--

05:23.032 --> 05:24.366
In any...

05:27.286 --> 05:28.454
I can't do any more.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.081
You know what, Dirk?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.875
I put finding my sister on hold

05:33.876 --> 05:35.126
because you promised me

05:35.127 --> 05:36.544
solving your case
would get us to her.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.504
And you were right, by the way.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.089
She's out there somewhere!

05:40.090 --> 05:41.716
This will all connect,

05:41.717 --> 05:44.177
I truly believe that.

05:44.178 --> 05:47.305
Friendship isn't just about
someone being there for you.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.515
It about you being there
for them too.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.142
I'm sorry they didn't
teach you that at Blackwing,

05:51.143 --> 05:53.354
but you need to stand up,
and let's go.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.196
I am sick of pep-talking you
into your own bullshit.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.282
For once in my life, I don't quit.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.826
I'll solve this one on my own.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.253
I can't do anything right.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.761
Uh...

06:26.762 --> 06:28.263
I beg your pardon?

06:29.264 --> 06:31.474
Wha--?

06:42.569 --> 06:43.903
What did you see?

06:43.904 --> 06:47.073
Just more death.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.617
The families,

06:49.618 --> 06:51.869
the Dengdamors, the Trosts,
they're killing each other.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.663
We have to do something.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.872
Amanda, listen,

06:54.873 --> 06:57.375
what you see is just
one possible future.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.293
I saw Farson's family dying.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.254
<i>You don't even care about that?</i>

07:01.255 --> 07:03.841
There are greater things
to fear than death.

07:05.801 --> 07:07.468
I don't get you.

07:07.469 --> 07:10.680
You talk about this world
like it doesn't matter.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.181
If The Boy returns,

07:12.182 --> 07:15.309
then he will repair
everything that has gone wrong.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.856
If he does not, then...
then we will all die.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.733
You and your friends can leave
at any time.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.944
You think I'm just gonna leave you
and everyone here to die,

07:24.945 --> 07:27.780
and just go back home
and pretend like everything's fine?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.449
Who do you think I am?

07:29.450 --> 07:30.324
Listen to me--

07:30.325 --> 07:31.617
No, you listen to me, Wakti.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.328
We can help people.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.496
I can fix this.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.541
Wendimoor is just a small piece
of something bigger.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.711
There is a war coming in your world,

07:41.712 --> 07:44.130
a war for all reality,

07:44.131 --> 07:45.798
between order...

07:45.799 --> 07:47.633
and chaos.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.718
People like you,

07:48.719 --> 07:52.763
the ones connected
to something deeper, must unite.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.058
You are the one who will unite them.

07:58.103 --> 08:03.650
Okay, I appreciate everything
you have done for me, but...

08:05.444 --> 08:08.571
I'll come back. Okay?

08:08.572 --> 08:10.199
I just can't let people die.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.496
Amanda...

08:16.497 --> 08:18.915
when you return to your world,

08:18.916 --> 08:20.458
you must gather the tools.

08:20.459 --> 08:25.923
The universe is broken,
and only you can fix it.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.556
Hey, Farson.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.517
Let's go.
You're going home, like, now.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.268
No, no, no, I ran away for a reason.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, listen,

08:40.521 --> 08:42.730
you running away
made things worse.

08:42.731 --> 08:43.773
You were right about The Mage.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.024
There's an army coming.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.943
You have powers.
Why don't you go stop the army?

08:46.944 --> 08:49.362
'Cause, low-key,
I suck with my powers.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.780
"Low-key?" What's that?

08:50.781 --> 08:53.074
Farson, let's not get wrapped up

08:53.075 --> 08:54.325
with the wording here.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.118
I see death.

08:56.119 --> 08:56.994
Lots of it.

08:56.995 --> 09:00.122
I know that you don't like
what's going on with your family,

09:00.123 --> 09:01.958
but you can't just run away forever.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.043
It's easy to just hide out

09:04.044 --> 09:06.170
and hope that your problems
will go away.

09:06.171 --> 09:09.048
I for sure get that impulse.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.218
But then that gives your problem
all of the power.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.345
You know what I mean?

09:14.346 --> 09:16.264
If you don't let me take you home,

09:16.265 --> 09:18.559
I think something
really bad will happen.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.522
Family...

09:24.273 --> 09:27.984
is the most
important thing we have,

09:27.985 --> 09:32.197
<i>and this family is under siege
by the Trosts.</i>

09:32.864 --> 09:35.741
They kidnapped
and murdered my son,

09:35.742 --> 09:37.076
Farson,

09:37.077 --> 09:40.288
just the most recent
in this decades-long conflict

09:40.289 --> 09:42.665
where we have all, all of us,

09:42.666 --> 09:46.168
lost loyal allies and friends.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.921
<i>So, the Dengdamors will do</i>

09:48.922 --> 09:51.841
what we have done
for three generations...

09:53.468 --> 09:58.014
We will stand our ground
in defense of this magnificent place.

09:58.015 --> 10:02.059
We will not be scared away
by mud-flinging peasants!

10:02.060 --> 10:03.728
No!

10:03.729 --> 10:05.062
We will protect our own!

10:05.063 --> 10:06.314
Yes!

10:06.315 --> 10:07.815
Gather our finest warriors!

10:07.816 --> 10:08.691
Yes!

10:08.692 --> 10:11.485
Death to the Trosts!

10:23.624 --> 10:25.500
What now, Silas?

10:27.836 --> 10:30.172
I'm sending a message
to Litzibitz Trost.

10:31.214 --> 10:34.301
I need to warn her and her family
if an attack is coming.

10:34.343 --> 10:35.509
Silas...

10:35.510 --> 10:38.137
I swore to your father
that I would protect you.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.972
I love you like me own son,

10:39.973 --> 10:41.474
but this...

10:41.475 --> 10:43.017
This?

10:43.018 --> 10:44.226
This be too much.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.312
You betray your family.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.023
Panto told me
the Trosts didn't take Farson,

10:49.024 --> 10:51.776
much less kill him.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.611
He must be out there somewhere.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.155
My mother won't listen.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.868
It's up to me to make this right.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.179
This is our only hope now.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.599
Unless the prophecy is fulfilled.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.434
Prophecy?

11:25.435 --> 11:28.020
You trust that Forest Witch
over your own mother?

11:28.021 --> 11:30.106
Come on, now, Silas,
wake up from this dream.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.399
What about Panto?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.650
What if he finds Dirk Gently?

11:32.651 --> 11:33.734
What if he brings--

11:33.735 --> 11:35.861
Your boy Panto has been
gone for days now.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.197
You must come alive to the facts.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.907
There is no other world.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.993
No one be coming to save us.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.676
Amanda!

12:00.721 --> 12:01.888
Amanda!

12:07.728 --> 12:08.770
Amanda!

12:11.064 --> 12:12.566
Amanda!

12:18.905 --> 12:20.489
The train...?

12:20.490 --> 12:22.408
It's all real.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.457
This is crazy now.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.418
This was a terrible plan.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.173
Amanda!

12:50.604 --> 12:53.647
The bridge.

12:53.648 --> 12:54.858
What is it?

12:56.610 --> 12:59.403
Is that a Dengdamor messenger parrot?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.239
It's a letter from Silas Dengdamor.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.199
He wants to meet.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.992
You're not serious.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.160
He's a Dengdamor.

13:06.161 --> 13:09.789
Even if he is smooching your brother,
you can't trust him.

13:09.790 --> 13:13.167
Silas is as scared
of bloodshed as we are.

13:13.168 --> 13:17.004
He says he knows
The Mage's men are in the valley.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.925
Shh, quiet.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.475
Litzibitz...

13:29.476 --> 13:31.268
where were you this morning?

13:31.269 --> 13:34.438
I'm trying to lead our people into battle,

13:34.439 --> 13:38.108
and my eldest child can't bother
to show her face?

13:38.109 --> 13:41.570
Father, we don't need
to go to war.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.447
We have other options.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.157
Go to war?

13:45.158 --> 13:47.535
We are already at war.

13:47.536 --> 13:48.744
Our fields are scorched,

13:48.745 --> 13:50.329
Panto is dead, or worse--

13:50.330 --> 13:52.456
You don't know that Panto is dead.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.708
If we could just talk
to the Dengdamors, then maybe--

13:54.709 --> 13:56.293
Oh, we'll talk to them.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.087
What's that?

13:58.088 --> 14:01.048
Sorry, can't hear you,
'cause you're dead!

14:04.261 --> 14:06.512
Come now, Litzibitz.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.138
Your brother is gone.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.850
Will you not fight in his name?

14:11.101 --> 14:13.937
You are being a bobo fool!

14:15.897 --> 14:19.400
How dare you call your father a bobo fool.

14:19.401 --> 14:20.652
You're the bobo.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.613
Let's go.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.898
Oo been sleetzin.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.066
Yoo mah boyfre now.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.614

15:06.615 --> 15:09.033
Sorry, this-this this is a lot

15:09.034 --> 15:10.701
for the first date, and I--

15:10.702 --> 15:12.202
Ware yoo go-ey ya stupid baboon?

15:12.203 --> 15:13.162
Uh...

15:13.163 --> 15:15.540
Oomah boyfre now, isnin'?

15:16.791 --> 15:18.876
Ah, yes, that sounded very much

15:18.877 --> 15:21.211
like you just used
the word "boyfriend," and--

15:22.213 --> 15:24.465
We frens inta wood now,

15:24.466 --> 15:28.552
talka beastie, no scares...

15:28.553 --> 15:31.972
Listen, I'm having
one of those emotions where,

15:31.973 --> 15:33.599
how to put this,

15:33.600 --> 15:35.726
I'm actively regretting
every decision

15:35.727 --> 15:37.519
that brought me
to this moment of life.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.605
Lov-ooom.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.439
Oh, God.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.116
Borga.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.618
Good chewa tum.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.537
Mmm, okay, I--

15:56.247 --> 15:57.624
So...

16:00.460 --> 16:01.460
Right.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.753
So...

16:02.754 --> 16:06.382
So this is a hamburger

16:06.383 --> 16:08.175
that grew on a...

16:08.176 --> 16:09.134
a vine.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.970
Borgabush!

16:12.180 --> 16:13.681
Ah! Fend now.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.516
Shutsie, beauty boy.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.684
Listen, perhaps--

16:16.685 --> 16:18.019
Shutsie shutsie, beauty boy!

16:33.827 --> 16:35.285
This is actually really good.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.372
Ow! Why?

16:38.373 --> 16:39.707
Boyfre.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.501
You... name...

16:42.502 --> 16:44.003
- "Bibbit."
- Bibbi--

16:44.004 --> 16:45.130
A-ha!

16:47.173 --> 16:48.550
Amanda!

16:49.718 --> 16:51.636
Come on, Amanda...?

16:57.308 --> 16:58.684
Whoa! Ah!

16:58.685 --> 16:59.936
I-I've seen this!

17:01.312 --> 17:03.148
Oh, shit. It's empty.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.157
How is this getting worse?

17:15.577 --> 17:17.369
Ah! What is this?

17:17.370 --> 17:18.455
Ow!

17:25.378 --> 17:27.380
Get off, man!

18:02.791 --> 18:06.251
Have you ever seen
something like this before?

18:06.252 --> 18:07.545
No...

18:08.588 --> 18:12.342
and his clothes be strange, too.

18:14.761 --> 18:18.597
I have never seen anything like this
in my travels.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.474
I can explain everything.

18:20.475 --> 18:24.103
Then explain why we found you
in a Kellum Knight camp.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.979
I can't explain that.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.315
But I can explain...

18:27.816 --> 18:29.399
Shit, what can I explain?

18:29.400 --> 18:30.609
You're in league with The Mage.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.986
You're one of his Square Boy Kellum thugs!

18:32.987 --> 18:34.154
No, no, no, don't like The Mage,

18:34.155 --> 18:35.781
don't like him or his guys,

18:35.782 --> 18:37.324
that much I am totally clear on,

18:37.325 --> 18:38.992
big anti-Mage guy here,

18:38.993 --> 18:40.786
I'm not a...

18:40.787 --> 18:42.204
a Square Boy?

18:42.205 --> 18:44.123
I'm a... I'm a house boy!

18:44.124 --> 18:45.999
I'm-I'm not a house boy, I...

18:46.000 --> 18:47.793
I came through the house.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.294
The bed in the house
is where I came through,

18:49.295 --> 18:51.422
in Mon...tana?

18:53.716 --> 18:54.633
We're all...

18:54.634 --> 18:55.843
We're all-- It's...

18:55.844 --> 18:57.970
It's all chill, man.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.139
I see.

19:00.223 --> 19:01.516
It makes sense now.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.475
He be madman.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.769
No, no, I can show you.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.563
I can show you, back in the...

19:07.564 --> 19:08.772
the ruins?

19:08.773 --> 19:10.274
You guys know the ruins?

19:10.275 --> 19:12.192
Dirk's back there,
I can show you to him.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.068
Dirk?

19:13.069 --> 19:15.070
Did you say "Dirk"?

19:15.071 --> 19:16.947
Like Dirk Gently?

19:16.948 --> 19:17.823
Yes.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.782
What?

19:18.783 --> 19:20.659
He's here, in Wendimoor?

19:20.660 --> 19:21.661
Yes.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.126
He's here in Wendimoor?

19:29.127 --> 19:30.043
Yeah.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.045
Dirk Gently is here!

19:32.046 --> 19:33.047
Woo!

19:47.729 --> 19:49.062
That's what you sound like.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.398
You don't know what it's like,

19:51.441 --> 19:53.066
back with my mother.

19:53.067 --> 19:56.070
There's constantly talk of attacks,

19:57.113 --> 19:59.364
of retaliation, of war--

19:59.365 --> 20:00.908
All families have issues, dude.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.367
You'll be fine.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.912
In fact, you'll be a goddamn hero.

20:04.913 --> 20:07.456
Not just a hero, but The Hero.

20:07.457 --> 20:10.083
Like, the guy, when you tell
this story of this old feud

20:10.084 --> 20:11.293
that went on for years.

20:11.294 --> 20:15.839
It all ended because
of Farson Dengdamor.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.843
That's, like, legendary, literally.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.220
I don't care about that stuff.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.554
I just...

20:22.555 --> 20:24.139
I want peace.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.933
Best of both worlds,

20:25.934 --> 20:28.227
peace, and you get to be the rock star.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.729
Why not do both?

20:30.939 --> 20:32.815
Don't move!

20:35.026 --> 20:36.610
I guarantee
whatever you're mad about

20:36.611 --> 20:38.362
has nothing to do with us.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.739
You're in the Trost Woods, trespasser.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.241
This is our home, dumbo.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.285
"Dumbo"? Really?

20:45.245 --> 20:47.746
You're Litzibitz Trost, aren't you?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.748
You're Farson Dengdamor.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.583
You're alive?

20:51.584 --> 20:54.044
Seems that way, doesn't it?

20:54.045 --> 20:56.338
My family's been accused
of your murder.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.048
See? It's a big misunderstanding.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.883
You can put the scissors away--

20:59.884 --> 21:00.926
Did you take him?

21:00.927 --> 21:02.094
Do you work for The Mage?

21:02.095 --> 21:04.388
Slow down, Comic-Con,
I'm just trying to help.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.890
She didn't take me.
She saved me.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.892
We want to make peace.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.727
I'm on my way
to meet your brother.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.312
Silas?

21:12.313 --> 21:16.401
See? This is all sort of
kind of working out, maybe?

21:17.860 --> 21:19.653
You're coming with us.

21:19.654 --> 21:22.155
I don't want to hurt you,
but any false moves,

21:22.156 --> 21:23.365
snip snap.

21:25.702 --> 21:26.702
Let's go.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.663
We're going to meet your brother.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.418
It's gonna be fine.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.888
Puh fo' her,

21:46.889 --> 21:49.141
and toh der...

21:49.142 --> 21:51.769
toh fo six haer now.

21:53.855 --> 21:57.316
Tooki boty, wow!

21:57.317 --> 21:58.191
Yes?

21:58.192 --> 21:59.818
Of course, darling,
that sounds wonderful.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.029
Ah...

22:02.238 --> 22:04.239
Boyfre te Bibbit.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.033
Yes, that's me now.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.659
I'm "Bibbit."

22:07.660 --> 22:09.453
This is my life.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.538
I guess it makes sense.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.207
You and I will have...

22:14.459 --> 22:16.335
puppies, or whatever you have,

22:16.336 --> 22:18.337
and I'll just... live in the woods

22:18.338 --> 22:22.091
like a uniquely elegant,
macho lumber man.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.428
I suppose there's worse things.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.223
You know what's frustrating

22:30.224 --> 22:33.101
is that I never
got ahead of this one.

22:33.102 --> 22:36.188
I was always
three steps behind.

22:36.189 --> 22:39.066
Oh... iz okey.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.027
And you know, it's funny,
because normally,

22:42.028 --> 22:44.071
no matter how off the road I go,

22:44.072 --> 22:46.031
no matter what goes wrong,

22:46.032 --> 22:48.784
I end up at least vaguely near a clue.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.286
Bibbit saz?

22:51.412 --> 22:54.206
Howt Bibbit unsaz?

22:54.207 --> 22:57.459
I can't help but think
I missed something somewhere.

22:57.460 --> 23:02.089
I finally had everyone
on my side this time, too,

23:02.090 --> 23:04.175
and I couldn't even
get out of my own way.

23:06.135 --> 23:09.262
I never even got to see
the boat in the field

23:09.263 --> 23:10.889
Todd and Farah were talking about....

23:10.890 --> 23:12.849
- Buhtena fela?
- Mmm.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.476
Dah wun?

23:14.477 --> 23:15.603
What?

23:19.607 --> 23:21.650
Bibbit bihbowt.

23:21.651 --> 23:23.443
Is that...

23:23.444 --> 23:25.446
the boat from Bergsberg?

23:26.447 --> 23:29.033
<i>Olthing fum webeckwen.</i>

23:41.921 --> 23:43.381
Another mural?

23:48.177 --> 23:49.010
You know Panto?

23:49.011 --> 23:50.804
<i>You</i> know Panto?

23:50.805 --> 23:52.514
Where is he? Is he all right?

23:52.515 --> 23:55.142
He's fine, he's back in our world,
safe and sound.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.269
He's the one who told us
about the Prophecy and The Mage.

23:57.270 --> 24:00.188
He's the one who found you,
then why isn't he here?

24:00.189 --> 24:03.775
My heart absolutely aches
every moment he's away.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.235
If you've done anything to hurt him--

24:05.236 --> 24:07.488
Wait, are you guys a thing?

24:08.531 --> 24:10.740
Careful what you tell him, Silas.

24:10.741 --> 24:12.285
He could be spy.

24:15.413 --> 24:18.458
Panto and I are very much in love,

24:19.834 --> 24:21.502
though our families are at war.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.255
Okay, great.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.048
Let's go find Dirk.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.675
And, Dirk, that guy?

24:28.676 --> 24:30.135
He'll explain everything.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.720
That we shall.

24:31.721 --> 24:34.222
But first, I must keep a promise.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.142
We're going to meet Panto's sister.

24:36.893 --> 24:38.269
I'll explain on the way.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.486
This is what happened to them.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.157
This is what happened in Bergsberg.

24:53.034 --> 24:54.785
You didn't draw this, did you?

24:55.369 --> 24:58.121
Binder fivevoh.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.373
Been here...

25:00.374 --> 25:02.084
"forever..."

25:08.216 --> 25:11.301
So, the boat...

25:11.302 --> 25:12.303
and...

25:13.804 --> 25:15.473
That must be Arnold.

25:20.937 --> 25:22.104
Wait...

25:23.231 --> 25:25.106
another boy.

25:25.107 --> 25:26.859
<i>There are two boys.</i>

25:29.278 --> 25:31.239
There were two Cardenas brothers?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.742
There were
two different paintings

25:35.743 --> 25:37.327
of two different boys

25:37.328 --> 25:39.913
in the house within a house.

25:39.914 --> 25:42.249
If there were two boys,

25:42.250 --> 25:44.543
then maybe Todd was right.

25:44.544 --> 25:48.089
Maybe Arnold wasn't The Boy at all.

25:52.301 --> 25:56.096
Of course I had no idea
what was going on.

25:56.097 --> 25:57.223
Look at it.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.601
Nothing links them.

26:01.686 --> 26:03.354
I'm missing something.

26:04.855 --> 26:06.190
What am I missing?

26:07.942 --> 26:08.984
Heppy?

26:08.985 --> 26:10.819
Bibbit heppy?

26:10.820 --> 26:12.488
Oh, yes, darling.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.747
So, you guys like...

26:23.332 --> 26:24.792
What do you guys like?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.795
Someone approaches.

26:31.549 --> 26:33.300
He was meant to come alone.

26:33.301 --> 26:34.426
As were you.

26:34.427 --> 26:35.927
It's well I didn't.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.721
Litzibitz Trost!

26:37.722 --> 26:39.973
Silas Dengdamor!

26:39.974 --> 26:41.600
That's my brother!

26:41.601 --> 26:43.184
Shut your yap
until we know it's safe.

26:43.185 --> 26:45.437
I apologize
for our tardiness.

26:45.438 --> 26:46.897
We were waylaid.

26:47.231 --> 26:50.191
It in no way reflects
my respect for your time

26:50.192 --> 26:51.860
and your good grace
in coming here.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.069
Todd?

26:53.070 --> 26:53.945
Amanda?

26:53.946 --> 26:55.573
That's my sister.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.494
How did you get here?
Where's Dirk?

27:01.495 --> 27:03.163
Seriously?

27:03.164 --> 27:05.332
Seriously, "Where's Dirk?"

27:05.333 --> 27:08.001
There's no way you came
to fairyland without him, so--

27:08.002 --> 27:09.878
How are you here?

27:09.879 --> 27:10.920
I fell through a bed.

27:10.921 --> 27:11.921
I went through a bathtub.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.131
- A what?
- A bathtub!

27:13.132 --> 27:14.299
Wait, did you just say "bed"?

27:14.300 --> 27:15.508
A literal bathtub?

27:15.509 --> 27:16.885
Where is Dirk?

27:16.886 --> 27:17.927
He's here somewhere.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.054
Who are those people?

27:19.055 --> 27:20.430
You lost Dirk?

27:20.431 --> 27:21.766
Silence, both of you!

27:23.100 --> 27:24.559
My mother readies for war.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.895
My father as well.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.855
If our families
cannot work together,

27:28.856 --> 27:31.191
The Mage and his army
will destroy us all.

27:31.192 --> 27:33.943
I can persuade her
to make concessions,

27:33.944 --> 27:36.279
but someone in your family
must answer

27:36.280 --> 27:38.615
for the disappearance
of my brother, Farson.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.325
I'm here!

27:40.326 --> 27:42.369
Silas, I'm here!

27:42.370 --> 27:43.703
Farson?

27:43.704 --> 27:45.164
There he is! Come on...

27:45.373 --> 27:47.415
If you didn't kidnap Farson,

27:47.416 --> 27:48.625
why do you have him now?

27:48.626 --> 27:50.210
We don't.

27:50.211 --> 27:51.211
Well, he's there.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.004
I ran away,

27:53.005 --> 27:55.174
and I was taken
by the Kellum Knights.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.094
I'm so sorry, Silas.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.929
Where's Panto?

28:00.930 --> 28:02.514
He's safe!

28:02.515 --> 28:03.640
Wait...

28:03.641 --> 28:05.350
how do YOU know Panto?

28:05.351 --> 28:06.643
He's in Bergsberg!

28:06.644 --> 28:07.936
You WERE in Bergsberg!

28:07.937 --> 28:10.563
He found Dirk.
Wait, you were in Bergsberg?

28:10.564 --> 28:11.565
Hold on!

28:12.274 --> 28:13.942
Dirk Gently?

28:13.943 --> 28:16.152
The man from the Prophecy?

28:16.153 --> 28:17.195
He exists?

28:17.196 --> 28:18.738
He definitely does!

28:18.739 --> 28:22.158
And this man, Toad,
says he can take us to him.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.411
Panto has always believed

28:24.412 --> 28:26.496
in finding Dirk Gently,

28:26.497 --> 28:28.289
in saving this world.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.542
We did not take him, Litzibitz.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.752
I love Panto,

28:32.753 --> 28:35.171
and our only desire
is to unite our families,

28:35.172 --> 28:37.465
and end all this crumminess!

28:37.466 --> 28:40.719
We can work to fulfill the Prophecy!

28:40.720 --> 28:43.556
We can save the valley,
and all of Wendimoor!

28:46.726 --> 28:48.643
Do not dare release that boy.

28:48.644 --> 28:51.104
Father, you followed me?

28:51.105 --> 28:52.773
You betrayed your family.

28:54.275 --> 28:55.400
These people have guns!

28:55.401 --> 28:56.526
Why do they have guns?

28:56.527 --> 28:57.902
That's bad, that's very bad.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.154
What do we do?

28:59.155 --> 29:00.613
This could be a trap.

29:00.614 --> 29:03.199
It absolutely is, you fool!

29:03.200 --> 29:05.076
And you've walked right into it.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.412
Wygar, you told her
we were coming here?

29:07.413 --> 29:09.164
I had to protect you.

29:10.499 --> 29:11.458
It's the Dengdamors.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.001
See, girl?

29:13.002 --> 29:14.545
I knew it was a trap!

29:22.344 --> 29:23.511
Dengdamors...!

29:23.512 --> 29:24.971
All right!

29:24.972 --> 29:27.640
Listen to me, all of you!

29:27.641 --> 29:31.186
You are clearly being played, okay?

29:31.187 --> 29:34.814
This is supposed to be a fairy tale!

29:34.815 --> 29:38.151
You're all supposed to be living
in, like, happy land!

29:38.152 --> 29:40.780
You're not supposed to be
killing each other for no reason!

29:41.739 --> 29:42.947
Farson,

29:42.948 --> 29:44.282
tell them.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.701
It's true!

29:46.702 --> 29:49.579
There can still be peace.

29:49.580 --> 29:53.166
The Mage's armies are coming.

29:53.167 --> 29:56.252
He sent these weapons
so we might slaughter one another,

29:56.253 --> 29:58.379
making his job easier.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.380
Can't you see?

29:59.381 --> 30:01.634
He wants us divided.

30:05.221 --> 30:09.224
But Wakti Wapnasi says that
if we can trust one another,

30:09.225 --> 30:11.143
if we can work together...

30:13.938 --> 30:15.313
then everything will be--

30:22.655 --> 30:25.740
Farson! No! No!

30:25.741 --> 30:27.700
Kill them all!

30:37.586 --> 30:39.088
Fulfill the prophecy before--

30:40.548 --> 30:42.423
Litzibitz, no!

30:42.424 --> 30:43.675
No!

30:48.848 --> 30:49.849
Amanda!

31:11.078 --> 31:12.620
We have to find Wakti Wapnasi, okay?

31:12.621 --> 31:14.205
She'll be able to fix this.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.415
I can get us back.

31:15.416 --> 31:16.916
I just need to follow the river.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.251
No, no, I'm gonna get us out of here.

31:18.252 --> 31:19.711
I'm going to find Dirk
and get us out of here.

31:19.712 --> 31:20.962
What?

31:20.963 --> 31:22.171
You want to leave?

31:22.172 --> 31:23.506
Yes, obviously.

31:23.507 --> 31:24.841
We-we can't.

31:24.842 --> 31:26.259
This whole place
is about to get wiped out.

31:26.260 --> 31:27.302
We have to find Wakti.

31:27.303 --> 31:28.761
Is that a person, or...?

31:28.762 --> 31:30.680
Look, no, Amanda,
we're getting out of Wendimoor,

31:30.681 --> 31:31.806
or whatever this place is.

31:31.807 --> 31:32.974
We're gonna find Dirk, and--

31:32.975 --> 31:34.267
Wh--Amanda!

31:34.268 --> 31:35.394
Amanda!

31:55.706 --> 31:56.998
♪ Little creatures ♪

31:56.999 --> 31:58.458
♪ little creatures... ♪

31:58.459 --> 32:01.586
♪ Out to see the Queen... ♪

32:01.587 --> 32:03.963
Hello, friend.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.049
Hi.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.717
Hi.

32:07.718 --> 32:10.053
I don't believe that we've met.

32:10.054 --> 32:13.431
I'm going to be queen

32:13.432 --> 32:15.266
here in Wendimoor.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.476
Yeah.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.311
The Mage, well, he quit,

32:18.312 --> 32:19.604
but, you know,

32:19.605 --> 32:22.982
me, I'm... I'm not a quitter.

32:24.026 --> 32:26.402
See, um, this book,

32:26.403 --> 32:30.239
it says that you are
the only other magical person

32:30.240 --> 32:31.658
in this world,

32:31.659 --> 32:34.494
so I'm afraid that I'm going
to have to evict

32:34.495 --> 32:36.956
you and the rest of the Treasure Trolls
from toilet village!

32:37.414 --> 32:40.167
I know you must feel
very powerful right now...

32:42.586 --> 32:45.338
but you will feel small again.

32:45.339 --> 32:46.924
Yeah, well...

32:47.925 --> 32:50.718
I think it would be smarter

32:50.719 --> 32:53.429
for you and your little friends

32:53.430 --> 32:54.681
to kneel

32:54.682 --> 32:57.809
before your new ruler!

32:57.810 --> 33:00.103
Aw...

33:00.104 --> 33:02.231
I'm not afraid of you.

33:03.691 --> 33:04.983
<i>Toros!</i>

33:07.945 --> 33:08.945
Amanda!

33:10.990 --> 33:12.031
Amanda...

33:12.032 --> 33:13.157
This is bad.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.326
Something's happening.
We need to go help.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.869
But wait!

33:35.389 --> 33:36.890
Wakti...?

33:39.018 --> 33:40.435
Suzie Boreton...

33:40.436 --> 33:41.310
This was Suzie Boreton.

33:41.311 --> 33:42.186
She could be anywhere.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.313
We can't stay here.

33:44.273 --> 33:46.149
I shouldn't have left.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.693
I should've been here.

33:49.319 --> 33:51.404
These people needed me.

33:51.405 --> 33:54.073
Farson told me they had been
waiting for Dirk for years.

33:54.074 --> 33:55.908
They need us to help!

33:55.909 --> 33:58.286
They don't seem very helpable, by us, okay?

33:58.287 --> 33:59.287
I need you, Amanda.

33:59.288 --> 34:00.163
I came here to get you--

34:00.164 --> 34:01.539
No, you came here for you.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.166
Out of guilt.

34:03.167 --> 34:05.418
I sacrificed everything to be here.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.962
I came here to try
and fix things between us.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.964
Can't you see how dangerous this is?

34:09.965 --> 34:11.924
Do you think I'm four years old?

34:11.925 --> 34:13.676
Do you think I am somehow
under the impression

34:13.677 --> 34:14.719
that this place is safe?

34:14.720 --> 34:17.889
It's not our job to save these people.

34:17.890 --> 34:20.266
Amanda, I know this sounds stupid,

34:20.267 --> 34:23.144
but there's, like, a good chance
that this is all just a drawing.

34:24.855 --> 34:26.773
A drawing.

34:26.774 --> 34:28.817
A drawing...

34:30.277 --> 34:33.279
I'm not going to leave everyone to die
because I'm worried about myself.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.323
That can be your thing.

34:35.324 --> 34:36.616
It's not mine.

34:36.617 --> 34:39.160
It's good to see you, Todd.

34:39.161 --> 34:40.412
Go away.

34:43.832 --> 34:45.584
The wide worlder.

34:46.960 --> 34:50.838
Witchakookoo of the wood,
you betray us.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.256
You betray all of us!

34:52.257 --> 34:53.967
No, look, I can explain.

34:55.552 --> 34:56.469
No, man,

34:56.470 --> 34:58.763
you're gonna listen to me.
This isn't my fault--

35:17.241 --> 35:18.992
They killed your brother.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.330
While you stood there watching.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.791
<i>The Trosts are animals.</i>

35:26.792 --> 35:29.001
<i>Worse than animals.</i>

35:29.002 --> 35:31.129
They said...

35:31.130 --> 35:33.214
Dirk Gently was here.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.341
They said...

35:35.342 --> 35:38.262
What is wrong with you?

35:41.098 --> 35:45.518
They killed your brother
in front of your eyes.

35:45.519 --> 35:47.228
Where is your love?

35:47.229 --> 35:49.647
Your honor, your loyalty?

35:49.648 --> 35:52.441
You would wilt and cower

35:52.442 --> 35:54.694
at the mention of what I would do,

35:54.695 --> 35:57.071
what I have done,

35:57.072 --> 35:58.615
to protect you.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.993
Farson wished for peace--

36:01.994 --> 36:04.163
And I wish they'd shot you instead.

36:09.710 --> 36:12.920
There will be blood.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.382
Much more blood.

36:34.860 --> 36:38.947
It has come to pass
just as The Mage foretold.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.494
Hello, boys!

36:45.495 --> 36:47.121
Hi!

36:47.122 --> 36:49.957
The Mage has left your world to me.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.168
I am his chosen successor,

36:52.169 --> 36:55.630
and have taken his place
as your rightful queen.

36:55.631 --> 36:57.632
What do you know of The Mage?

36:57.633 --> 36:58.591
Stand aside.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.219
Judgey, judgey!

37:01.595 --> 37:04.055
Stand down.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.015
She holds the apprentice's wand.

37:06.016 --> 37:09.728
<i>Pulchritudo ratzo agazai!</i>

37:19.488 --> 37:20.989
Much better.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.867
Hail to The Mage.

37:24.868 --> 37:25.785
No.

37:25.786 --> 37:29.455
Hail to me.

37:36.338 --> 37:38.172
The answer is here somewhere.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.715
It's just...

37:39.716 --> 37:41.676
disguised, presently.

37:41.677 --> 37:43.678
I dunner witsez.

37:43.679 --> 37:45.554
I'm missing something. Right?

37:45.555 --> 37:46.681
I'm missing something.

37:46.682 --> 37:50.018
I'm forgetting some obvious thing
that's been shown to me.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.731
Mona Wilder sent me to Bergsberg,

37:55.732 --> 37:57.441
straight to the Cardenas family--

37:57.442 --> 37:59.235
rest in trees--

37:59.236 --> 38:02.071
And these pictures
look just like the ones

38:02.072 --> 38:03.197
at the Cardenas house,

38:03.198 --> 38:06.033
so The Boy must have been there...

38:06.034 --> 38:07.452
at some point.

38:08.870 --> 38:09.954
At the hospital,

38:09.955 --> 38:11.539
Arnold talked about the monster,

38:11.540 --> 38:12.915
the other house,

38:12.916 --> 38:15.543
the creation of a world,

38:15.544 --> 38:17.878
but never mentioned a brother.

38:17.879 --> 38:20.799
Does that mean
the brother-boy is here now?

38:21.800 --> 38:24.385
He said they brought
something home from the boat.

38:24.386 --> 38:25.886
Was that the brother?

38:25.887 --> 38:28.180
The mural at the house

38:28.181 --> 38:30.641
had The Boy on the throne
with those symbols,

38:30.642 --> 38:33.436
and the bed in the house
sent me to the throne here,

38:33.437 --> 38:37.607
so maybe The Boy, Arnold's brother,
did the same thing.

38:38.608 --> 38:40.318
When did The Boy get here?

38:40.319 --> 38:41.403
Uh...

38:43.447 --> 38:46.449
Maybe The Boy got lost
in Wendimoor ages ago,

38:46.450 --> 38:48.659
and so he drew all this himself?

38:48.660 --> 38:50.745
No, that's not it.

38:50.746 --> 38:53.206
Bibbit...luff... te painty.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.754
Those are "Z"s.

38:59.755 --> 39:03.466
They're "Z"s, like, "Zzz,"

39:03.467 --> 39:04.842
and they...

39:04.843 --> 39:07.846
Like-like "snore," you know, and-and...

39:09.973 --> 39:14.101
Arnold said this was "going" to be real.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.396
He didn't say it "was" real.

39:18.357 --> 39:19.899
Dreams...

39:19.900 --> 39:22.778
This came from a dream.

39:24.363 --> 39:28.032
The Boy could create things
while he was asleep.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.117
He could make them real.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.203
But maybe...

39:32.204 --> 39:34.413
ever since he created this place,

39:34.414 --> 39:36.916
he-he he's been asleep, or--

39:42.923 --> 39:44.299
Solved it.

39:50.097 --> 39:52.890
I am so sorry about this.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.226
Wasdat?

39:57.938 --> 39:58.771
Solved it!

39:58.772 --> 39:59.815
I solved it!
