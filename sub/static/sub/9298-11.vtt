00:12.925 --> 00:17.013
Mr. Gregory had this way
of making everyone feel good,

00:17.047 --> 00:19.848
even when we were
painting over graffiti.

00:19.882 --> 00:23.415
Should be good to go.
Give it a good stir first, okay? - Okay.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.384
Dante.

00:27.590 --> 00:30.469
Closest thing I ever had to a father.

00:30.503 --> 00:32.103
Bring that ladder over here.

00:32.137 --> 00:33.939
Okay, Mr. Gregory.
Want me to set it up? - Yeah.

00:33.973 --> 00:35.443
But Little T...

00:35.477 --> 00:38.114
He didn't like
what Mr. Gregory stood for.

00:48.866 --> 00:50.868
Just like that...

00:52.503 --> 00:53.970
No!

00:56.773 --> 00:58.908
Mr. Gregory was gone.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.554
Is Terrance Jones,
the man you know as Little T,

01:10.588 --> 01:12.457
who you saw shoot Elmore Gregory?

01:12.491 --> 01:13.826
Yeah, that's him.

01:13.861 --> 01:17.198
Can you describe the gun
used in the shooting?

01:17.232 --> 01:20.137
It was a Mac-10, all black-like,
with a big barrel.

01:20.171 --> 01:21.838
Bad-ass gun.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.542
Isn't it true that you were
focused on the weapon,

01:23.576 --> 01:25.210
focused on saving yourself?

01:25.244 --> 01:27.947
Yeah, but -- so focused,
you couldn't possibly see the shooter

01:27.982 --> 01:29.816
because you were only
looking at the gun.

01:29.850 --> 01:31.184
Isn't that true, Mr. Moore?

01:31.218 --> 01:33.520
Trust me. The defense attorney
will be worse.

01:33.554 --> 01:35.755
Answer the question, Dante,
just like we practiced.

01:38.759 --> 01:42.594
I saw Terrance Jones
kill Elmore Gregory.

01:42.629 --> 01:43.829
It was Little T.

01:50.002 --> 01:53.006
Good job. That's all
you have to do tomorrow.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.542
I think we're ready for trial.

01:55.576 --> 01:57.711
Good, 'cause I'm starving.

01:57.746 --> 01:59.514
Meet you outside.

01:59.548 --> 02:03.851
Come on. Let's get you
to the hotel and get you fed.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.556
Just be yourself on the stand
tomorrow, okay, Dante?

02:07.590 --> 02:08.690
That's all you got to do.

02:08.725 --> 02:09.824
You'll be there with me?

02:09.859 --> 02:12.495
The whole time.

02:12.530 --> 02:13.997
Come on.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.624
I want to thank you
for being the only guy

02:37.658 --> 02:39.526
with the guts
to stand up to Little T.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.061
I'm standing up for Mr. Gregory.

02:41.095 --> 02:42.695
It will be very intimidating

02:42.730 --> 02:44.864
when you see Terrance Jones
in the courtroom.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.734
I'm buggin' a little.
Little T's homies are looking for me.

02:47.769 --> 02:49.571
Oh, don't worry about it, all right?

02:49.605 --> 02:51.039
They're not gonna find you.

02:51.073 --> 02:53.141
Um, this is officer Jermaine Walker,

02:53.176 --> 02:55.611
and he will be outside
your hotel room all night.

02:55.645 --> 02:57.747
How you doing?
I'll make sure nothing happens.

02:57.781 --> 02:59.716
You have my word.
All right.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.952
See you tomorrow. Order a steak.
No, no, no, no. Don't.

03:02.987 --> 03:05.221
I'm concerned about
promise, reward, and inducement.

03:05.256 --> 03:06.923
The defense attorney
could come after us

03:06.958 --> 03:08.692
if we give him anything --
you know that.

03:08.726 --> 03:10.594
You can't lock him in a room

03:10.628 --> 03:11.595
and not give him food.

03:11.629 --> 03:12.729
Just keep it modest.

03:14.065 --> 03:16.733
Order a steak, all right,
but a cheap one.

03:16.768 --> 03:17.768
And watch a movie.

03:17.802 --> 03:18.869
For real?
Yeah.

03:18.903 --> 03:20.671
Keep it clean, right?

03:20.705 --> 03:22.039
See you in the morning.

03:22.073 --> 03:23.907
Yeah. Okay.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.815
"Reward and inducement"?

03:30.849 --> 03:34.220
Like Dante's gonna risk his life
to testify for a free steak?

03:34.254 --> 03:36.122
Valerie Delgado
is a great prosecutor.

03:36.156 --> 03:38.958
I know, I know. The best there is.
She's never lost a murder trial.

03:38.992 --> 03:42.062
But? - Just wish she'd
lighten up a little bit.

03:43.699 --> 03:45.833
Valerie Delgado says
your witness is prepped.

03:45.868 --> 03:48.370
Yeah, I think he's good to go, sir.

03:48.404 --> 03:50.105
Keep up the good work.
We all want this guy.

03:50.140 --> 03:52.975
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.

03:53.010 --> 03:55.912
Little T is responsible
for at least 15 murders.

03:55.946 --> 03:58.115
Remember when we almost got him
with the drive-by

03:58.149 --> 04:00.350
of the grandmother
and the 8-year-old kid?

04:00.385 --> 04:03.387
That witness "disappeared"
when Terrance Jones was charged.

04:03.422 --> 04:06.624
Since then, no one has come
forward until Dante stepped up.

04:06.659 --> 04:08.360
So, how does a white female cop

04:08.394 --> 04:11.163
get the confidence
of a black kid from the hood?

04:11.197 --> 04:13.732
I have mad skills.
No.

04:13.767 --> 04:16.769
Korsak's the one that got us
his fingerprints on the weapon.

04:16.803 --> 04:18.070
- No big deal.
- Yes, it is!

04:18.105 --> 04:19.706
You're the one who found the C.I.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.841
Who told us that the gun
was still in Little T's car.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.810
Yeah, we caught a few breaks
on this one.

04:23.845 --> 04:25.913
I want to look professional
on the stand. Which one?

04:27.715 --> 04:30.082
Hmm. What's that music I'm hearing?

04:32.152 --> 04:33.719
What music?

04:33.753 --> 04:36.922
Oh, it's your ties,
singing disco songs.

04:37.824 --> 04:39.991
All right, Armani.
What would you wear?

04:42.194 --> 04:44.194
Let's see.

04:44.229 --> 04:47.064
- Uh, where's the other one?
- The other one?

04:47.098 --> 04:50.435
This is two-for-one from the
gentleman's warehouse, right?

04:50.469 --> 04:52.303
Jane: God, you know what?

04:52.338 --> 04:53.772
Go away, please.

04:53.806 --> 04:56.676
He's right.
I got no sense of style.

04:56.710 --> 04:59.445
Oh, come on.
He's just messing with you.

04:59.480 --> 05:02.682
Here. Wear this one.
Goes nice with your eyes.

05:02.717 --> 05:03.717
Thank you.

05:09.724 --> 05:14.795
You are taking forever. Come on.

05:14.829 --> 05:17.064
You haven't touched
your mulberry leaves

05:17.098 --> 05:18.832
or the wheatgrass.

05:18.866 --> 05:22.802
Bass, you love
your Opuntia Cactus pads!

05:22.837 --> 05:24.304
Aah!

05:24.338 --> 05:26.272
Aah!
Oh! Oh, my God.

05:26.307 --> 05:27.373
You scared me.

05:27.408 --> 05:29.276
I'm so sorry.

05:29.310 --> 05:32.746
I just wanted to watch something
on your plasma.

05:32.781 --> 05:34.815
Oh. You're a Bill O'Reilly fan?

05:34.850 --> 05:38.353
He has the most beautiful
Irish blue eyes.

05:38.387 --> 05:40.422
I-I hope you don't mind,

05:40.456 --> 05:43.859
but the TV in the guest house
just doesn't do them justice.

05:43.894 --> 05:46.429
Well, they look like contacts. No!

05:46.463 --> 05:48.264
Yeah, Paris Hilton wears them, too.

05:48.298 --> 05:50.299
I didn't think you read tabloids.

05:50.334 --> 05:53.102
<i>Oh, no. I read that in
Ophthalmological Month journal.</i>

05:53.136 --> 05:54.337
Yeah. Of course.

05:54.371 --> 05:56.205
So, why is the sound off?

05:56.239 --> 06:00.309
Oh. Mr. O'Reilly's very bright
but a little opinionated.

06:00.343 --> 06:03.879
And he gets on my nerves
when I listen to him.

06:03.913 --> 06:05.313
Well, neurological studies show

06:05.348 --> 06:07.315
that listening to someone
you disagree with

06:07.350 --> 06:08.784
helps stimulate the brain.

06:08.818 --> 06:11.420
Oh, I'm stimulated watching him.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.221
Oh, turn it up!

06:13.256 --> 06:15.157
This is why I'm watching.

06:15.191 --> 06:16.892
<i>Elmore Gregory
was one of the good guys --</i>

06:16.927 --> 06:18.494
<i>a young father of two</i>

06:18.528 --> 06:21.930
<i>who stood up to drug dealers
and paid with his life.</i>

06:21.965 --> 06:23.832
<i>Here he is on "The Factor"
two years ago.</i>

06:23.867 --> 06:25.935
<i>I say put your Xbox down,</i>

06:25.969 --> 06:27.537
<i>get your paint rollers
and your courage,</i>

06:27.571 --> 06:29.239
<i>and stand up to these drug dealers...</i>

06:29.273 --> 06:30.473
- That's Jane's case.
- I know.

06:30.508 --> 06:33.210
Bill O'Reilly's in town to cover it.

06:33.244 --> 06:35.345
<i>- Isn't it exciting?
- Elmore Gregory's alleged murderer,</i>

06:35.380 --> 06:37.014
<i>this man, Terrance "Little T" Jones,</i>

06:37.048 --> 06:38.950
<i>goes on trial tomorrow.</i>

06:38.984 --> 06:41.453
<i>Boston homicide detectives
apparently have an eyewitness</i>

06:41.487 --> 06:43.489
<i>who is prepared to identify Jones</i>

06:43.523 --> 06:46.825
<i>as the killer of a good man,
a patriot...</i>

06:46.859 --> 06:48.493
Why is your door unlocked?

06:48.527 --> 06:50.528
Hey, ma -- okay,
I couldn't find any sour patch,

06:50.563 --> 06:52.263
so you got to settle
with gummi bears.

06:52.298 --> 06:53.898
It's good.

06:53.933 --> 06:56.568
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Turn that crap off, ma.

06:56.602 --> 06:58.570
Uh, Jane, O'Reilly is doing --

06:58.604 --> 07:00.105
Off, all right?

07:00.139 --> 07:01.539
We all know you're in love with B.O.

07:01.574 --> 07:03.008
Don't call him that.

07:03.042 --> 07:03.842
Off!

07:04.977 --> 07:08.580
Too bad, since he's doing
the whole show on your case.

07:08.615 --> 07:10.049
What?

07:10.083 --> 07:11.550
But since you're not interested --

07:11.585 --> 07:14.987
wait. No. Turn it back on.
Ma, turn it back on!

07:15.021 --> 07:18.190
<i>- Look, it's you!
- O'Reilly: Now tomorrow, the trial of Terrance Jones begins,</i>

07:18.225 --> 07:20.126
<i>and we will be there.
Shh!</i>

07:20.161 --> 07:22.362
<i>Boston police say he's a suspect</i>

07:22.397 --> 07:24.565
<i>in at least 15 other murders.</i>

07:24.599 --> 07:26.900
<i>Now homicide detectives
finally have Jones</i>

07:26.934 --> 07:29.436
<i>right where they want him --
facing a jury</i>

07:29.470 --> 07:31.370
<i>for killing a man
who stood up to him.</i>

07:31.405 --> 07:33.539
<i>Let's hope
there will finally be justice</i>

07:33.573 --> 07:35.341
<i>for this father of two</i>

07:35.376 --> 07:37.310
<i>who wasn't afraid
to speak up for what's right.</i>

07:37.344 --> 07:39.545
Wow.
Wouldn't that be something?

07:39.580 --> 07:42.147
Yes, it would.

07:46.518 --> 07:48.619
Hey, ma, can you make me some eggs?

07:48.653 --> 07:50.988
- Sure!
- Thank you.

07:51.022 --> 07:53.490
I can't believe she has the hots
for Bill O'Reilly.

07:54.659 --> 07:55.960
"His Irish blue eyes"?

07:55.994 --> 07:57.428
Vomit.

07:57.462 --> 08:00.030
Well, studies show that men
with great earning potential

08:00.065 --> 08:01.899
are still the most desirable mate.

08:01.933 --> 08:03.500
She's too old to mate.

08:03.535 --> 08:05.336
Rizzoli!

08:05.370 --> 08:08.472
At least that stops her
from falling for Stanley.

08:08.507 --> 08:10.241
How many times I got to tell you?

08:10.275 --> 08:12.242
The jelly doughnuts don't go here.

08:12.277 --> 08:14.245
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Stanley.

08:14.279 --> 08:15.546
Look at this mess.

08:15.581 --> 08:18.449
You got strawberry jelly
on the sprinkles.

08:18.483 --> 08:20.051
Oh, that's a problem.

08:21.253 --> 08:24.055
Stanley has
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

08:24.089 --> 08:27.960
The two doughnuts making contact
is very upsetting for him.

08:27.994 --> 08:30.029
Good.

08:30.063 --> 08:31.531
Rizzoli.

08:31.565 --> 08:33.332
All right, we'll be right there.

08:33.366 --> 08:36.169
Gang-related shooting.
Let's go.

08:45.681 --> 08:48.049
Jane: What do we got?

08:48.083 --> 08:52.520
Victim's male,
African-American, early 20s.

08:52.554 --> 08:54.454
Gang affiliation?

08:54.489 --> 08:56.156
No one's talking.

08:56.190 --> 08:57.590
Some things never change.

08:58.993 --> 09:01.094
Oh, God. No.

09:01.128 --> 09:02.661
Jane, who is it?

09:02.696 --> 09:03.729
Oh, God.

09:07.266 --> 09:10.469
It's Dante, my witness.

09:27.981 --> 09:30.382
There was a guard
right outside his hotel door.

09:30.417 --> 09:31.851
Frost is checking it out.

09:31.885 --> 09:34.186
Little T ordered this hit from jail.

09:34.221 --> 09:36.722
How'd they find him?
I talked him into this, Korsak.

09:36.757 --> 09:38.924
- You're not responsible for this.
- Yeah, I am.

09:38.959 --> 09:42.061
Rigor indicates he's been dead
about eight hours.

09:42.095 --> 09:43.629
So he was killed last night.

09:43.664 --> 09:45.631
One gunshot wound
to the back of the head.

09:45.666 --> 09:48.433
It's a close contact,
execution style.

09:49.936 --> 09:52.905
Hey. I'm glad you're here.
You believe this?

09:52.939 --> 09:55.173
What I can't believe
is how you let this happen.

09:55.208 --> 09:57.008
<i>Oh! Nobody let this happen.</i>

09:57.043 --> 10:01.079
Lividity suggests he's been
lying here six to eight hours.

10:01.113 --> 10:03.380
Yeah, and yet nobody
thought to call it in.

10:03.414 --> 10:05.115
I don't see
any blood or brain matter.

10:05.150 --> 10:06.383
He wasn't killed here.

10:06.417 --> 10:08.186
I want an internal affairs
investigation

10:08.220 --> 10:10.655
into that officer you put
on the hotel room.

10:10.689 --> 10:13.792
Really? You think that's the
most important thing right now?

10:13.826 --> 10:16.128
- Dante's dead, Valerie.
- You vouched for that officer, Jane.

10:21.101 --> 10:22.402
If we're getting technical,

10:22.436 --> 10:24.170
<i>his safety wher responsibility.</i>

10:24.205 --> 10:25.406
Let's not play the blame game.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.108
I just want to find out who did this.

10:27.142 --> 10:29.076
His wallet's still here.
Did you see his phone? - No.

10:29.110 --> 10:31.245
I'll get a subpoena going
for his phone records. Right.

10:31.279 --> 10:34.682
I want to take a look at that hotel
room myself and talk to Walker.

10:34.716 --> 10:37.084
<i>- Go. I'll handle this.
- Can you handher?</i>

10:37.119 --> 10:39.153
The guy with three ex-wives? Psh!

10:39.187 --> 10:41.388
That's what I thought.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.857
Okay.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.827
I looked at the surveillance tape.

10:46.862 --> 10:49.129
- He's telling the truth.
- How is that possible?

10:49.164 --> 10:51.465
Walker never left his post.
Dante never left the room.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.433
Front desk says
no calls on the room phone,

10:53.468 --> 10:55.902
no card-key activity
on the door, just room service.

10:55.936 --> 10:58.004
- Did we check the room-service guy?
- Clean.

10:59.506 --> 11:02.275
What time was it
when you last saw Dante?

11:02.309 --> 11:05.244
Look, he was fine. I saw him
when they brought his dinner.

11:05.279 --> 11:06.379
What time was it?

11:06.413 --> 11:08.181
It was 8:53 P.M.

11:08.215 --> 11:10.984
Look, I come from the same project.

11:11.019 --> 11:12.353
I know what it took

11:12.387 --> 11:14.255
for him to stand up
to someone like Little T.

11:14.289 --> 11:18.460
Jermaine, it's okay.
Nobody's blaming you for this.

11:19.395 --> 11:21.029
He barely touched his burger.

11:21.064 --> 11:23.065
He was starving.
He hadn't eaten all day.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.868
Something big
must have interrupted him.

11:24.902 --> 11:26.436
Or someone called him
on his cellphone.

11:26.470 --> 11:28.972
He was a foster kid.
He bounced from home to home.

11:29.006 --> 11:30.306
No family. So who?

11:30.341 --> 11:32.475
Maybe a friend he trusted.

11:32.510 --> 11:34.344
Who lured him to his death.

11:34.379 --> 11:36.180
No signs of a struggle.

11:36.214 --> 11:38.148
Jermaine, did you open the window?

11:38.183 --> 11:41.318
It was hot when we came into
the room. Dante opened it.

11:42.521 --> 11:45.889
Excuse me.
Can you dust the sill for me?

11:53.299 --> 11:55.434
Look at the way
the prints are facing.

11:55.468 --> 11:57.936
Looks like the prints
are facing outward,

11:57.971 --> 12:00.072
like he was hanging from the window.

12:00.106 --> 12:02.008
Hmm.
You think he climbed out?

12:02.042 --> 12:04.110
I don't know, Jane.
It's two stories.

12:04.144 --> 12:05.845
It's a long drop.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.981
Do you see any other way
for him to get out of here?

12:08.015 --> 12:11.117
What the hell made him bolt?

12:13.888 --> 12:16.389
What does the loss
of your witness do to your case?

12:16.423 --> 12:18.291
It's not good, but we've still got

12:18.326 --> 12:20.293
the gun with Terrance Jones' prints,

12:20.328 --> 12:22.228
and I've never lost a murder trial.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.429
Wow, that's impressive.

12:23.464 --> 12:25.798
Oh, crap.
I've got a flat.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.935
Wouldn't be surprised
if a gangbanger slashed my tire.

12:28.969 --> 12:30.036
Damn.

12:30.070 --> 12:32.505
Oh, no.
It wasn't slashed.

12:32.539 --> 12:34.907
Looks like
you ran over a roofing nail.

12:34.942 --> 12:37.175
The last time I called
peppy road service,

12:37.209 --> 12:39.177
it took them like four peppy hours.

12:39.211 --> 12:40.178
I'll be here all day.

12:40.212 --> 12:41.579
I'll change it for you.

12:41.613 --> 12:44.081
No. What? You don't have to
do that. It's fine.

12:44.116 --> 12:45.550
No, no. It's okay.

12:45.584 --> 12:47.885
Just need to get
the right footwear for the job.

12:49.587 --> 12:51.588
You sure you don't want my help?

12:51.623 --> 12:53.223
No, thank you, sergeant.

12:53.258 --> 12:55.459
I like to keep my skill set fresh.

12:55.494 --> 12:57.394
I feel bad, watching you do it
all by yourself.

12:57.429 --> 12:59.096
Don't.
She's faster than peppy.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.400
It's a dicey neighborhood. You
want me to wait around with you?

13:03.435 --> 13:04.935
She can take care of herself.

13:04.969 --> 13:06.103
No, it's fine.

13:06.137 --> 13:08.005
I'll see you back at headquarters.

13:09.474 --> 13:11.041
He really thinks we're incompetent.

13:12.210 --> 13:14.011
No, he doesn't.

13:14.045 --> 13:15.612
He's just, uh, protective.

13:15.646 --> 13:17.347
Why is it men always think
that women,

13:17.382 --> 13:19.116
we don't know
what the hell we're doing?

13:19.151 --> 13:21.184
Actually, there are exciting advances

13:21.219 --> 13:23.220
in brain mapping and genetic research

13:23.254 --> 13:25.288
that prove some stereotypes are true.

13:25.322 --> 13:28.257
Really? What, like
men are better drivers?

13:28.292 --> 13:30.927
Yes. Actually,
probably due to testosterone.

13:30.961 --> 13:33.997
Seems they have an advantage
in spatial ability.

13:34.031 --> 13:35.865
Okay, don't tell
my colleagues that, please.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.234
All right. There you go.

13:38.269 --> 13:41.938
You can drive on the spare,
but you should get a new tire.

13:41.973 --> 13:44.274
Let me ask you --
what's science have to say

13:44.308 --> 13:47.310
about the chances of a woman
who can't change her own tire

13:47.345 --> 13:48.511
becoming the next D.A.?

13:48.546 --> 13:49.980
Excellent.

13:57.355 --> 13:59.056
Hi.

13:59.091 --> 14:01.492
The prints from the window sill
belong to Dante.

14:01.527 --> 14:03.161
You started the autopsy?

14:03.195 --> 14:05.531
Just about to.

14:07.066 --> 14:08.466
Oh, yuck.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.169
It's Delgado, asking me again,
for the 400th time,

14:11.203 --> 14:12.570
if I've filed a 1920.

14:12.605 --> 14:14.572
I thought I'd memorized
all your cop talk.

14:14.606 --> 14:17.008
You know, "code 10." That's lunch.

14:17.042 --> 14:19.009
And "I'm off for a personal."

14:19.044 --> 14:21.411
That's when you have to do
number two.

14:21.446 --> 14:22.979
Stop.

14:23.014 --> 14:25.981
1920 is the internal-affairs
complaint form...

14:26.016 --> 14:28.016
... Which I'm not filing,

14:28.051 --> 14:30.052
because Walker
had nothing to do with this.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.588
You know, she's very nice if you
approach her in the right way.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.257
Yeah, I thought so, too,
but now I think grizzly bears are nicer.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.059
Ursus Horribilis.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.929
Grizzly bear. It's a remarkably
bad-tempered creature.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.032
It's Ursus Delgado.

14:44.066 --> 14:45.067
Again.

14:46.369 --> 14:48.370
More like Ursula Americanus.
Black bears.

14:48.404 --> 14:51.974
But they rarely attack unless
they've had a bad Berry year.

14:52.008 --> 14:53.709
But when they do, watch out.

14:53.743 --> 14:55.678
So Delgado had a bad Berry year?

14:55.712 --> 14:57.647
She wants to be the D.A.,
so she has to be tough.

14:57.681 --> 14:59.282
Oh, and I was gonna vote for her,

14:59.316 --> 15:01.284
but if she doesn't quit
calling me, she can forget it.

15:01.319 --> 15:02.986
Hi, honey!
Did you hear the great news?

15:03.020 --> 15:05.322
North Korea has a new leader?

15:05.356 --> 15:08.158
No. Bill O'Reilly's
having a book signing tonight.

15:08.192 --> 15:09.426
Wow. Can't wait.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.994
But Mr. Stanley won't let me leave.

15:12.028 --> 15:14.497
Jane, maybe you could, um,
take me later

15:14.531 --> 15:17.132
and badge me
to the front of the line?

15:17.167 --> 15:18.166
Have Frankie take you.

15:18.201 --> 15:20.035
- Take you where?
- Yeah.

15:20.069 --> 15:21.970
It could be payback for
all the Metallica concerts

15:22.004 --> 15:23.070
he made you take him to.

15:23.105 --> 15:24.438
You're right.
I nearly forgot.

15:24.472 --> 15:27.007
I couldn't hear for three days
after that last one.

15:27.042 --> 15:29.009
Noise-induced hearing loss.

15:29.044 --> 15:32.580
Exposure to noise levels over
85 decibels can cause damage.

15:32.614 --> 15:34.481
I missed the beginning
of this conversation.

15:34.516 --> 15:36.149
What the hell are we talking about?

15:36.184 --> 15:38.085
Bill O'Reilly
is having a book signing,

15:38.119 --> 15:39.520
and ma wants you to take her

15:39.554 --> 15:41.588
so you can badge her
to the front of the line.

15:41.622 --> 15:42.756
Oh. No. Have fun.

15:45.593 --> 15:47.127
So...

15:47.161 --> 15:50.030
How much clout
does the M.E. have in this town?

15:50.064 --> 15:53.065
<i>Oh, look at the time!
We have so much work to do.</i>

15:53.100 --> 15:54.633
- I'll take you.
- You will?!

15:54.668 --> 15:56.068
No, Maura.
Mnh-mnh-mnh-mnh.

15:56.103 --> 15:58.204
- Oh.
- Bring your badge.

15:58.238 --> 15:59.238
I look forward to it.

15:59.272 --> 16:01.173
Yes!

16:01.207 --> 16:03.308
The last book signing I went to

16:03.343 --> 16:05.510
was "Organ Pathology Essentials."

16:05.544 --> 16:07.111
And you didn't invite me?

16:07.146 --> 16:10.048
Diameter of the entry wound
is 9.1 millimeters.

16:10.082 --> 16:13.384
Puts the bullet
in the .38-caliber family.

16:13.419 --> 16:15.520
Cheap gun one
of Little T's underlings

16:15.554 --> 16:17.188
wouldn't mind tossing.

16:17.222 --> 16:18.822
Can you help me with his shirt?
Yeah, sure.

16:20.826 --> 16:25.430
He just wanted to be
like Elmore Gregory, you know?

16:25.464 --> 16:31.136
Stand up to the bad guy,
make the world a better place.

16:35.508 --> 16:37.410
"Destiny."

16:37.444 --> 16:40.079
A predetermined course of events.

16:40.114 --> 16:41.815
Which led him here.

16:43.684 --> 16:45.284
God, what a waste.

16:45.319 --> 16:48.688
This could be peat moss
on the bottom of his shoe.

16:48.723 --> 16:50.424
I'll have the crime lab analyze it.

16:50.458 --> 16:51.625
You're not gonna find any of that

16:51.659 --> 16:53.294
in the projects or at the hotel.

16:53.328 --> 16:55.729
That could tell us where
he was killed. - Yeah.

16:55.763 --> 16:59.667
Oh, hello.
And how are you?

16:59.701 --> 17:01.369
Maura, you're talking to a shoe.

17:02.137 --> 17:05.472
Crushed husk of arthropod larvae

17:05.507 --> 17:07.174
embedded in his tread.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.541
And an exoskeleton.

17:08.576 --> 17:10.711
So? You found a cockroach.
I'll alert the media.

17:10.744 --> 17:13.413
They're all over the place
at the Franklin street projects.

17:13.446 --> 17:14.814
Don't assume it's a cockroach.

17:14.848 --> 17:16.848
There are thousands
of different arthropods.

17:16.883 --> 17:18.817
I'll consult a forensic entomologist.

17:18.852 --> 17:21.252
He should be able to I.D.
the species.

17:21.287 --> 17:23.488
Oh, crap.
I got to get to court.

17:23.522 --> 17:25.590
Without my witness.

17:25.625 --> 17:27.826
At least you still have
the murder weapon.

17:27.861 --> 17:29.895
Yeah.
We'll get him, Maura.

17:34.502 --> 17:36.336
Wooster: At this time, your honor,

17:36.371 --> 17:38.506
the defense requests
a motion to dismiss.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.775
What? He can't do that.
On what grounds, your honor?

17:40.809 --> 17:42.877
The prosecution can't prove its case.

17:42.912 --> 17:44.412
They can no longer
produce their witness.

17:44.447 --> 17:46.381
Yeah, because your client killed him!

17:46.415 --> 17:49.117
- Hey, I didn't kill no one.
- Shh, shh. Shh, shh.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.585
They're trying to frame me
is what they're trying to do.

17:50.619 --> 17:52.887
Mr. Wooster, if you don't
silence your client,

17:52.921 --> 17:54.588
I will have him removed.

17:54.623 --> 17:57.624
Defense has a good point,
counselor. Your witness is dead.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.192
Delgado: We plan to present
the murder weapon

17:59.226 --> 18:01.828
with the defendant's prints
on it, your honor.

18:01.862 --> 18:04.363
Fruit of the poisonous tree,
your honor. Motion to suppress.

18:04.398 --> 18:05.831
No, he can't do that.
That's so ridiculous.

18:05.866 --> 18:07.433
That weapon was lawfully seized

18:07.467 --> 18:08.768
by virtue of a search warrant,
your honor.

18:08.802 --> 18:10.804
The defense can show
that warrant was issued

18:10.838 --> 18:13.774
based upon a false statement
by sergeant detective Korsak.

18:13.808 --> 18:14.775
What?!

18:14.810 --> 18:16.611
That's enough, detective.

18:16.645 --> 18:19.914
Please explain, Ms. Delgado.

18:19.948 --> 18:22.284
Sergeant Korsak stated
he got the information

18:22.318 --> 18:24.152
from a person known
to the commonwealth.

18:24.187 --> 18:25.521
He will be able to produce

18:25.555 --> 18:27.322
his confidential informant
to the court.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.357
Sergeant Korsak?

18:29.358 --> 18:32.260
Are you prepared
to produce your informant?

18:36.732 --> 18:38.231
No, your honor.

18:39.300 --> 18:42.169
You have two days
to think this over, sergeant.

18:42.203 --> 18:45.205
Produce your informant,
or this case is dismissed.

18:45.239 --> 18:47.607
Court is adjourned.

18:48.909 --> 18:51.244
Can't pin no murder on me.

18:53.481 --> 18:55.515
You better produce your C.I.,

18:55.549 --> 18:57.350
or that smug asshole is gonna walk.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.621
I can't, Jane.

19:01.656 --> 19:03.390
I can't.

19:09.158 --> 19:11.258
I have no idea where he is.

19:11.293 --> 19:14.995
I haven't talked to him since we
investigated Gregory's murder.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.997
- You'll find him.
- He lived off the grid.

19:17.032 --> 19:19.266
I don't even think
I had a phone number for him.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.867
I'm gonna hit the street.

19:20.901 --> 19:22.001
It's the only chance I have
of finding him.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.236
You want company?

19:23.270 --> 19:26.238
No. Stay here
and work Dante's murder.

19:30.777 --> 19:31.476
What?

19:32.779 --> 19:35.914
Unh-unh. Korsak did not
make up his informant.

19:35.948 --> 19:37.916
Didn't say that.
You didn't have to.

19:37.950 --> 19:39.918
Your raised eyebrow said it for you.

19:42.188 --> 19:44.223
Don't tell me
it hasn't crossed your mind.

19:44.257 --> 19:46.225
Korsak was my partner for years.

19:46.259 --> 19:48.761
There is no way
he would break the rules.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.397
Even for a dirtbag like Little T?

19:50.431 --> 19:53.066
Korsak's been after him
since he came up to homicide.

19:53.101 --> 19:55.069
He finally gets a chance
to put him away.

19:55.103 --> 19:57.872
Would you blame him
for breaking the rules?

19:57.906 --> 20:01.242
No. And neither would you,
but the justice system would.

20:01.276 --> 20:03.845
I'm gonna go see
if Maura has anything.

20:07.282 --> 20:08.816
How's it going?

20:08.851 --> 20:11.719
I'm teaching Frankie
about the post-mortem interval

20:11.753 --> 20:13.387
based on...
Stomach contents.

20:13.421 --> 20:16.256
- Everybody's talking about it.
- His stomach contents?

20:16.291 --> 20:18.891
I'd do it, too -- fabricate
a C.I. to take down Little T.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.126
Oh, hey. Korsak did not
make up an informant,

20:21.161 --> 20:23.162
and if you want to work in homicide,

20:23.196 --> 20:25.398
you don't ever let anybody hear
you talking like that, all right?

20:25.432 --> 20:26.833
Okay. Okay. Sorry.

20:26.867 --> 20:30.503
Bad news.
Undigested iceberg lettuce.

20:30.538 --> 20:33.373
<i>Oh, gosh. I have to sit down.
That terrible news.</i>

20:33.407 --> 20:34.374
- It is?
- No.

20:34.408 --> 20:36.009
That's just Maura news.

20:36.044 --> 20:38.913
Maura: Good news --
undigested ground beef.

20:38.947 --> 20:41.015
I can't tell what grade it is.

20:41.050 --> 20:42.984
Yippee. Can you tell
what market it came from?

20:43.019 --> 20:44.119
I'm ignoring you.

20:44.153 --> 20:46.054
Sesame seeds, white bread...

20:46.089 --> 20:47.989
All undigested.

20:48.023 --> 20:51.759
<i>Wait. Dante's food was undige--
that is interesting news.</i>

20:51.793 --> 20:55.462
Why? - Hamburger typically
takes two hours to digest.

20:55.497 --> 20:57.264
Means he died less than
two hours after he ate?

20:57.298 --> 20:58.298
Very good.

21:01.435 --> 21:02.935
Thin, white coating on his tongue.

21:02.969 --> 21:04.937
It could be oral thrush.

21:07.207 --> 21:09.975
Fabulous find.
No, thank you.

21:11.177 --> 21:12.411
Hmm.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.780
It's minty.

21:14.814 --> 21:17.015
- Since when is oral thrush minty?
- It isn't.

21:17.050 --> 21:20.052
I suspect this may turn out to
be residue from a breath mint.

21:20.086 --> 21:23.455
But we didn't find any
breath mints in Dante's things.

21:23.489 --> 21:25.423
Which means what, Frankie?

21:25.458 --> 21:27.459
He had bad breath?

21:27.493 --> 21:28.460
Think.

21:28.494 --> 21:29.561
All right?

21:29.595 --> 21:31.429
Dante hadn't eaten all day,

21:31.463 --> 21:33.264
he didn't finish his burger,

21:33.298 --> 21:35.266
so why does he pop a breath mint

21:35.300 --> 21:36.800
right before he's killed?

21:36.835 --> 21:38.068
So, the question is,
who gave it to him?

21:38.103 --> 21:40.303
Yes, and where was he that he felt

21:40.338 --> 21:42.872
comfortable enough to suck on a mint?

21:42.907 --> 21:46.475
Maybe Dante was meeting a chick.

21:46.510 --> 21:47.843
A chick?

21:47.878 --> 21:49.245
Frost: He might be right.

21:49.279 --> 21:51.181
I mean, what else or who else
could have lured him

21:51.215 --> 21:52.883
out of the safety of that hotel room?

21:52.917 --> 21:54.385
Well, he had no family,
no girlfriend,

21:54.419 --> 21:56.487
nobody in his life
for Little T to intimidate.

21:56.522 --> 21:58.289
Little T's crew used a girl.

21:58.324 --> 22:00.893
That is genius, Frankie. How
do we solve murders without you?

22:00.927 --> 22:03.395
Are you this rude
to all your colleagues?

22:06.466 --> 22:09.067
Korsak, any luck?
I'm working on it.

22:09.101 --> 22:12.036
Oh. Got Dante's cellphone records.

22:12.070 --> 22:15.439
Last incoming call -- 8:55.

22:15.473 --> 22:18.875
Two minutes after room service
dropped his burger off.

22:18.910 --> 22:20.277
It's from a burn phone.

22:20.311 --> 22:22.145
Can't you trace it?

22:22.179 --> 22:24.514
No. It's all the rage
with the gangbangers.

22:24.549 --> 22:26.883
All right.
Well, any other calls?

22:26.917 --> 22:28.285
What's this one at 8:30?

22:28.319 --> 22:30.121
Oh!
And there it is again.

22:30.155 --> 22:32.457
There it is again.
He called it a lot.

22:32.491 --> 22:33.925
Hmm.

22:35.929 --> 22:37.529
It comes back to Relita Washington.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.598
Address is in
the Franklin street projects.

22:39.633 --> 22:43.302
Gee, that sure looks like a chick.

22:43.336 --> 22:45.037
I'm waiting for an apology.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.373
Have a seat.
You'll be waiting a long time.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.175
Again with the rude remarks.

22:49.209 --> 22:52.211
That's someone
I'd pop a breath mint for.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.581
Jane: Relita.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.218
Yes?

22:59.252 --> 23:01.287
I'm detective Rizzoli.
This is detective Frost.

23:01.321 --> 23:02.955
Can we come in?

23:11.031 --> 23:13.333
Do you know a Dante Moore?

23:14.335 --> 23:16.169
Who?

23:18.405 --> 23:20.673
I don't know
who you're talking about.

23:25.146 --> 23:27.147
Well, maybe Destiny does.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.418
We need to talk.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.555
We kept it a secret.
We had to.

23:35.589 --> 23:38.925
Dante was too afraid
Little T would find out.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.128
He was a good guy, Dante.

23:42.163 --> 23:44.297
He loved our baby so much.

23:44.331 --> 23:46.299
You know,
that's why he was testifying.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.500
He said he didn't want
our daughter growing up

23:48.535 --> 23:53.305
in a world ruled by fear, you know?

23:55.441 --> 23:58.109
When was the last time
you spoke to Dante?

23:59.378 --> 24:02.480
Yesterday after he got to the hotel.

24:02.515 --> 24:04.682
He said he was scared

24:04.717 --> 24:08.387
but there was a cop who was
on the door watching him.

24:08.421 --> 24:10.388
Were you supposed to meet him
last night?

24:10.422 --> 24:11.656
No. No way.

24:11.691 --> 24:15.027
No, he wasn't
leaving that hotel room.

24:15.061 --> 24:18.197
He was too afraid Little T's
boys would be looking for him.

24:18.231 --> 24:21.166
He wasn't going nowhere,
especially near the projects.

24:21.201 --> 24:23.636
Do you know of anyone
he might have talked to,

24:23.670 --> 24:26.172
anyone who could have
convinced him to leave?

24:26.206 --> 24:28.307
The only one
he really trusted was you.

24:28.342 --> 24:32.445
I wish he'd trusted me enough to
tell me about you and Destiny.

24:32.479 --> 24:36.583
Why? Maybe we'd be dead, then, too.

24:38.385 --> 24:41.287
Nobody could protect him
from Little T.

24:41.321 --> 24:44.623
We're gonna get him, okay?
We will.

24:44.657 --> 24:47.226
Little T's gonna be free,
like he always is.

24:47.260 --> 24:50.263
That's not true, all right?
We won't let that happen.

24:50.297 --> 24:51.631
I won't let that happen.

25:02.547 --> 25:05.516
104.

25:05.550 --> 25:07.050
I mean, what if we don't get in?

25:07.085 --> 25:08.719
Oh, we'll get in.

25:11.289 --> 25:13.557
It's really a prestigious thing

25:13.591 --> 25:15.692
to be the chief medical examiner

25:15.727 --> 25:18.696
of the commonwealth of Massachusetts.

25:18.730 --> 25:19.697
Thank you.

25:19.731 --> 25:20.964
Can I see your badge?

25:24.902 --> 25:26.703
Wow!

25:26.738 --> 25:30.774
This would definitely mean
an autograph from Mr. O'Reilly.

25:30.808 --> 25:32.676
You just have to...
Show... The guy...

25:32.710 --> 25:34.278
Wait. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

25:34.312 --> 25:35.712
I heard he's gonna stop signing soon.

25:35.747 --> 25:36.780
What?

25:36.814 --> 25:40.083
Oh, no!
Maura, come on.

25:41.719 --> 25:44.988
Okay. Okay. Come on.

25:46.024 --> 25:48.091
Man: Get in the back of the line.

25:48.126 --> 25:49.226
Commonwealth business.

25:49.260 --> 25:52.596
This is my, uh, coworker.

25:52.630 --> 25:55.098
I can't believe it.
It's him!

25:55.132 --> 25:56.633
Hey, you pinheads.
You can't cut.

25:57.735 --> 26:00.269
<i>We're patriots
on official business, mister.</i>

26:02.373 --> 26:04.640
Hi. What's your name?

26:04.675 --> 26:06.275
Uh... Uh...

26:06.309 --> 26:08.711
Her adrenal glands are
over-producing adrenaline.

26:08.745 --> 26:11.780
It dilates the blood vessels
and makes it hard to talk.

26:11.815 --> 26:14.082
Fascinating.
What's her name?

26:14.116 --> 26:15.650
Uh...

26:15.685 --> 26:17.886
Angela.
Angela Rizzoli.

26:17.920 --> 26:18.953
Thank you, Madeline.

26:18.988 --> 26:20.321
With two z's.

26:21.657 --> 26:24.860
Is this beautiful young lady
your daughter?

26:24.894 --> 26:26.828
Yes.
This is Madeline.

26:26.863 --> 26:28.697
Oh, I have a daughter, too.
Her name is Jane.

26:28.732 --> 26:31.667
Detective Jane Rizzoli?

26:31.701 --> 26:32.901
Yes, of -- of course you know her.

26:32.936 --> 26:34.170
You're covering her case.

26:34.204 --> 26:36.005
I'd love to get her on "The Factor."

26:36.039 --> 26:38.307
Oh, I'm sure she would love
to be your guest.

26:38.342 --> 26:40.877
Excellent.
Let me give you her cellphone number.

26:40.911 --> 26:42.378
Angela.
It's 617...

26:42.413 --> 26:43.780
No.

26:43.814 --> 26:45.348
555...

26:45.382 --> 26:47.083
30...

26:49.186 --> 26:51.888
Excuse me.

26:56.259 --> 26:57.826
Here's what doesn't make sense --

26:57.861 --> 26:59.295
Dante told Relita he's staying put.

26:59.329 --> 27:01.030
Then he gets a call
from a burn phone,

27:01.064 --> 27:02.231
and he jumps out a window.

27:03.266 --> 27:05.868
Rizzoli.

27:05.902 --> 27:07.836
Oh! Very funny.

27:07.871 --> 27:08.871
Who's that?

27:08.905 --> 27:10.239
Said it was Bill O'Reilly.

27:10.274 --> 27:12.408
For the love of Pete.

27:12.443 --> 27:16.045
You call me again, I'll arrest you
for harassing a police officer.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.247
Korsak: I said forget it!

27:18.282 --> 27:20.950
Delgado: I'd love to, sergeant,
but if I "forget it," a murderer walks.

27:20.985 --> 27:23.087
How about you do
what you've been ordered to do?

27:23.121 --> 27:26.190
That doesn't sound good.

27:26.224 --> 27:29.928
Okay, read my lips --
I don't know where my C.I. is.

27:29.962 --> 27:31.429
Is that clear enough for you?

27:31.464 --> 27:32.998
Hey, show some respect, sergeant.

27:33.032 --> 27:35.000
Ms. Delgado's
just trying to do her job,

27:35.034 --> 27:36.868
which is more than I can say for you.

27:36.903 --> 27:39.204
The judge has ordered you
to present the informant.

27:39.238 --> 27:42.206
I want his name, and I want it now.

27:42.241 --> 27:44.142
Jane: Vince, you got to
give her the name,

27:44.176 --> 27:46.811
even if you don't know where he is.

27:46.845 --> 27:50.181
No. All the judge said was
"bring him to court." I can't.

27:50.215 --> 27:53.852
We call it a "confidential
informant" for a reason!

27:53.886 --> 27:55.487
Where's your paperwork for this C.I.?

27:57.290 --> 28:00.392
Oh, my God.

28:00.426 --> 28:02.794
You did make him up, didn't you?

28:02.828 --> 28:06.197
It's not the judge you have
to worry about now, sergeant.

28:06.232 --> 28:09.067
It's me. I'll see
you go to prison for this.

28:13.805 --> 28:17.241
Either give me a name
or give me your badge.

28:37.764 --> 28:41.133
<i>Boston homicide detectives
unlocked the jail door</i>

28:41.167 --> 28:44.870
<i>and let a drug-dealing murderer
back out onto the street.</i>

28:44.904 --> 28:46.305
<i>That's an outrage.</i>

28:46.339 --> 28:48.841
<i>And it makes me wonder,
are they corrupt, too?</i>

28:48.876 --> 28:50.476
Oh, my God.

28:50.511 --> 28:53.079
<i>The cops get their
young witness, Dante Moore,</i>

28:53.114 --> 28:54.247
<i>murdered while in their custody.</i>

28:54.281 --> 28:56.048
<i>But that's not all.</i>

28:56.083 --> 28:59.151
<i>Sources now tell me sergeant
detective Vince Korsak,</i>

28:59.185 --> 29:01.453
<i>lead investigator on the case,</i>

29:01.488 --> 29:04.089
<i>even fabricated
a confidential informant.</i>

29:04.123 --> 29:06.926
<i>So it looks like
not only is their case gone...</i>

29:06.960 --> 29:08.293
Please turn it off.

29:08.328 --> 29:10.362
<i>But respect for the entire Boston --</i>

29:10.396 --> 29:13.365
I want to be alone.

29:13.399 --> 29:15.133
Too bad.

29:17.435 --> 29:19.904
I know how long
you've wanted Little T.

29:19.938 --> 29:21.339
Vince, we all know that.

29:21.373 --> 29:24.108
Everything O'Reilly said
about me is true.

29:24.143 --> 29:25.309
It just...

29:25.344 --> 29:27.144
Isn't the truth.

29:27.178 --> 29:29.580
What do you mean?

29:31.549 --> 29:33.149
Nothing.

29:37.989 --> 29:41.057
I've known you a long time,
Vince Korsak.

29:41.092 --> 29:44.127
And I know you're
holding something back.

29:44.162 --> 29:47.931
You know where your C.I. is.
You've known the entire time.

29:47.965 --> 29:50.134
You can't go down for this, Vince.

29:50.168 --> 29:53.270
We've already lost one witness.
I can't guarantee his safety.

29:53.304 --> 29:54.905
Think about the safety
of all the Dantes

29:54.939 --> 29:57.808
and all the Elmore Gregorys
in the world.

29:57.842 --> 30:01.078
15 murders Little T
is responsible for.

30:01.112 --> 30:02.513
15.

30:02.547 --> 30:04.348
Tell me the name of your C.I.

30:04.382 --> 30:06.183
Please.

30:08.053 --> 30:09.920
I can't.

30:18.897 --> 30:22.233
I don't agree with you,
but I respect what you're doing.

30:22.267 --> 30:24.435
Come on.
I'll take you home.

30:24.470 --> 30:26.938
Leave me alone, Jane.

30:30.409 --> 30:31.977
Okay.

30:43.472 --> 30:45.106
What are you doing?

30:45.141 --> 30:47.442
He's not going down for this --
not on my watch.

30:47.476 --> 30:48.676
Korsak's too careful.

30:48.711 --> 30:50.345
<i>Even if the C.I. does exist,</i>

30:50.379 --> 30:52.714
you said Cavanaugh couldn't find
a name in his file.

30:52.748 --> 30:55.250
Well, here's what we know --
the informant is listed as

30:55.284 --> 30:56.851
"a person known to the commonwealth."

30:56.885 --> 30:58.819
That means the informant
is not a criminal.

30:58.854 --> 31:00.754
So his C.I. didn't give up
the location of the gun

31:00.789 --> 31:02.323
in exchange for a reduced sentence.

31:02.357 --> 31:04.724
So that leaves money, payback, or...

31:04.758 --> 31:06.826
A person doing a good deed.

31:06.860 --> 31:10.229
Go up against Little T and tell
a cop where the murder weapon is?

31:10.263 --> 31:11.730
That's a hell of a good deed.

31:17.203 --> 31:19.604
He interviewed hundreds
of people. Yeah.

31:19.638 --> 31:23.274
So... Exclude any name
with an address...

31:23.309 --> 31:25.409
Or a follow-up interview.

31:25.444 --> 31:26.744
Not following you.

31:26.779 --> 31:28.412
Korsak's protecting this informant.

31:28.447 --> 31:30.314
That means, the only thing
we're gonna find

31:30.349 --> 31:32.717
is a name, all by itself --
that'll be the giveaway.

31:32.751 --> 31:35.187
And that's the name of the informant.

31:35.221 --> 31:38.624
<i>You do have mad skills.</i>

32:00.380 --> 32:02.214
Frost, I got it.

32:02.249 --> 32:03.550
I got a name.

32:03.584 --> 32:05.718
You sure?

32:05.753 --> 32:07.721
Damn, I think you're right.

32:07.755 --> 32:09.155
Where you going?

32:09.190 --> 32:11.758
To convince the C.I.
To do the right thing.

32:11.792 --> 32:13.259
Not without backup.

32:16.831 --> 32:19.165
Little T's already
back in charge here.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.767
Jane: The elevators are out.

32:20.801 --> 32:22.469
He's saying this is his turf.

32:22.504 --> 32:23.837
Yo, sister Five-O.

32:23.872 --> 32:26.907
What you comin' up here for?
To be my shortie?

32:26.942 --> 32:29.978
Step away, punk-ass bitch!

32:36.252 --> 32:37.586
"Bitch" was a nice touch.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.454
Wasn't too much?
No, no, no. It was nice.

32:39.488 --> 32:40.555
I liked it.
Okay.

32:40.589 --> 32:43.391
Never tell Korsak this, but...

32:43.425 --> 32:45.759
I always admired the guy.

32:45.794 --> 32:48.895
Because he'd rather lose
everything that he's worked for

32:48.930 --> 32:51.331
than take a chance that
somebody'd hurt his C.I.?

32:51.365 --> 32:52.965
Yeah.

32:57.003 --> 32:58.638
Jane: Hi, Relita.

33:00.641 --> 33:02.474
Can we come in?

33:16.989 --> 33:19.690
My head feels like
an anvil dropped on it.

33:19.725 --> 33:20.958
This better be good.

33:20.992 --> 33:22.726
It is.

33:26.431 --> 33:27.731
What the hell?

33:27.765 --> 33:29.666
Jane: Your confidential informant

33:29.701 --> 33:32.436
doesn't really look like
a "he", Korsak.

33:32.470 --> 33:33.937
Hi, sergeant.

33:35.740 --> 33:38.575
You don't have to do this, Relita.

33:39.677 --> 33:43.280
Relita understands
that Dante sacrificed his life

33:43.315 --> 33:44.949
so his daughter
wouldn't have to grow up

33:44.983 --> 33:46.718
around the same violence that he did.

33:46.752 --> 33:50.021
Detective Rizzoli told me
what you were willing to do.

33:50.056 --> 33:51.390
I have to do this.

33:51.424 --> 33:53.525
For you, for Dante.

33:53.560 --> 33:56.395
But mostly for Destiny.

33:57.930 --> 33:59.797
Thank you.

33:59.831 --> 34:01.032
Thank detective Rizzoli.

34:01.066 --> 34:04.367
I wouldn't have come forward
without her.

34:04.402 --> 34:07.337
I forgot some files
I need to pick up at work.

34:07.371 --> 34:09.572
There are two uniforms
outside the apartment.

34:09.606 --> 34:11.040
Don't take your eyes off her.

34:11.074 --> 34:12.608
I'll see you at the hearing at 2:00?

34:12.641 --> 34:13.742
Yeah.
Did you tell Delgado?

34:13.775 --> 34:16.043
No.

34:16.078 --> 34:18.079
I saved that for you.

34:26.755 --> 34:27.855
Hello, Stanley.

34:27.889 --> 34:29.023
Hello, Rizzoli.

34:30.993 --> 34:33.995
That's nice.
Have you two become friends?

34:34.029 --> 34:36.496
Mm-hmm. Watch this.

34:39.601 --> 34:40.801
Stanley.

34:41.803 --> 34:43.070
The ketchup top is making contact

34:43.103 --> 34:45.405
with the napkin dispenser.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.408
What are you doing?
Don't do that.

34:48.442 --> 34:50.009
I'm sorry.

34:51.378 --> 34:52.511
I'm not sorry.

34:53.780 --> 34:56.382
- O'Reilly: Detective Rizzoli?
- Yeah?

34:56.416 --> 34:58.484
- You hung up on me.
- I did?

34:58.519 --> 35:00.320
- That was really you?
- Both times.

35:00.354 --> 35:02.623
How did you get my number?

35:02.657 --> 35:03.791
Uh-oh.

35:03.825 --> 35:05.860
You need to come on "The Factor,"

35:05.894 --> 35:07.895
talk about the story --
it's important.

35:07.929 --> 35:11.565
I've got nothing to say to you.
You, either.

35:11.600 --> 35:14.802
I respect police work more
than any other profession. - Oh, yeah.

35:14.836 --> 35:17.371
I can tell by the hatchet job
you did on my partner.

35:17.406 --> 35:18.706
If we made a mistake,

35:18.740 --> 35:21.509
come on the program,
set the record straight.

35:21.543 --> 35:23.611
I don't think you should, Jane.

35:23.645 --> 35:25.480
You can be a very mean man.

35:25.514 --> 35:27.682
You weren't very nice
to Barney Frank.

35:27.717 --> 35:31.719
Although I did think it was rude
when he called you boorish.

35:31.753 --> 35:34.089
Appreciate it.

35:34.123 --> 35:35.890
Oh. I'm sorry. This is urgent.
It's about arthropods.

35:35.924 --> 35:38.893
My grandfather, John O'Reilly --

35:38.928 --> 35:40.963
member of the NYPD in the 1930s.

35:40.997 --> 35:42.898
I still have his Billy club.

35:42.932 --> 35:45.401
Well, keep it away
from your detractors.

35:45.435 --> 35:46.869
- Jane.
- Yeah.

35:46.904 --> 35:48.871
I got to show you
something important. - Okay.

35:48.906 --> 35:51.508
If you'll excuse me,
I have murders to solve.

35:51.542 --> 35:54.544
Detective, Elmore Gregory
was a great man.

35:54.579 --> 35:57.414
No one wants to see Terrance
Jones get away with his murder.

35:57.448 --> 35:58.982
Come on the program.

35:59.016 --> 36:00.884
Maybe somebody will see it,
come forward with information.

36:00.918 --> 36:02.051
It could help.

36:02.086 --> 36:03.719
No, thanks.

36:03.753 --> 36:05.721
I'm sorry I called you mean.

36:05.755 --> 36:08.089
You're not nearly as awful in person.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.691
Thank you.

36:09.725 --> 36:12.494
I know a really nice
Italian restaurant

36:12.528 --> 36:15.497
in the north end,
and I get off early today.

36:15.531 --> 36:18.933
I cannot believe she just said that.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.703
The foremost expert
in forensic entomology

36:21.737 --> 36:24.039
identified the larva on Dante's shoe.

36:24.073 --> 36:25.540
What am I looking at?

36:25.575 --> 36:28.910
The Asian longhorn beetle.
It's an exotic pest.

36:28.945 --> 36:31.813
Do you realize
what a big break this is?

36:31.848 --> 36:35.017
No, but I didn't spend my life
playing with bug larva.

36:35.952 --> 36:38.887
There has been a recent
infestation of the Asian longhorn.

36:38.922 --> 36:41.891
Please don't tell me
that they're marching to my apartment.

36:41.925 --> 36:44.794
They're only found in this
one area -- loyalist park.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.095
Wait, are you saying that Dante

36:46.130 --> 36:47.731
could have been killed in this park?

36:47.765 --> 36:49.934
Oh, no -- I'm only able
to conclusively say

36:49.968 --> 36:52.003
that Dante's shoes
were in loyalist park

36:52.037 --> 36:53.704
the night he was murdered.

36:53.739 --> 36:56.040
Okay, you know what?
You are officially ridiculous.

36:56.074 --> 36:59.576
His shoes didn't go there
by themselves. Come on, Maura!

37:08.231 --> 37:11.301
Even you have to admit
this looks like blood.

37:11.335 --> 37:14.137
It is a reddish-brown substance
consistent with blood.

37:14.171 --> 37:15.772
Big concession.
Thank you very much.

37:15.807 --> 37:18.341
Okay. What about this?
This brain matter right here.

37:18.376 --> 37:20.210
It appears to be human tissue.

37:20.244 --> 37:23.180
I think we just found the spot
where Dante was killed.

37:23.214 --> 37:25.650
- Frost: Jane.
- Yes?

37:25.684 --> 37:27.218
Found some fresh tire tracks.

37:27.252 --> 37:29.688
Okay. Can you make a cast
of the tire impressions?

37:29.722 --> 37:31.623
Copy that.
I'll get CSRU on it.

37:34.126 --> 37:36.061
Jane, it's a right rear tire.

37:36.095 --> 37:39.064
- Can you tell me the manufacturer?
- Road ready.

37:39.099 --> 37:41.834
Well, that's not gonna help.
It's too common.

37:43.569 --> 37:46.171
This impression -- it's from a nail.

37:46.839 --> 37:48.774
And it's from a roofing nail.

37:51.611 --> 37:53.178
You have a funny look on your face.

37:53.213 --> 37:55.514
I feel a little bit sick.

37:55.548 --> 37:58.383
I recognize this tire tread.

38:09.796 --> 38:11.196
Where's Ms. Washington?

38:11.231 --> 38:13.199
I don't have much time to prep her.

38:13.234 --> 38:15.134
She's changing her baby's diaper.

38:15.169 --> 38:17.337
Well, tell her to leave the baby
and come with me.

38:17.371 --> 38:19.106
You didn't change your spare tire.

38:20.208 --> 38:21.842
I've been a little busy.

38:21.877 --> 38:24.312
But that is your car,
isn't it, counselor?

38:28.851 --> 38:32.587
What are they doing?
Why are they in my car?

38:32.621 --> 38:33.721
Your flat tire.

38:33.756 --> 38:35.523
We found the same tire tread

38:35.557 --> 38:37.859
in the place
where Dante was murdered.

38:37.893 --> 38:40.829
It's like finding a fingerprint.

38:40.863 --> 38:42.664
Oh, hey. Korsak.

38:42.698 --> 38:44.699
That's a .38 revolver, isn't it?

38:44.734 --> 38:45.801
Yeah. .38.

38:45.835 --> 38:48.236
Stupid to leave it in your car.

38:48.270 --> 38:50.572
You learn that from Little T?

38:56.379 --> 38:58.647
Okay, I, um...

38:58.681 --> 39:00.749
I will testify against Mr. Jones.

39:00.783 --> 39:03.385
He's the one
who set this whole thing up.

39:03.419 --> 39:05.320
That's who you want.

39:05.354 --> 39:08.189
What did you say to Dante
on the burn phone

39:08.223 --> 39:10.391
to get him to jump two stories?

39:11.427 --> 39:13.528
I told him...

39:17.666 --> 39:19.200
I told him, um,

39:19.235 --> 39:22.304
the officer outside his door
was -- was dirty.

39:22.338 --> 39:24.807
And I drove him to the woods.

39:24.841 --> 39:25.908
And you shot him.

39:26.910 --> 39:31.213
Please. Please. Please,
I will give you Little T.

39:31.248 --> 39:33.683
You won't ever get him without me.

39:33.718 --> 39:36.486
I went through your case files.
You've never lost a case.

39:36.521 --> 39:37.888
Nobody's that good, counselor.

39:37.922 --> 39:39.857
Unless they have Terrance Jones
in their pocket.

39:39.891 --> 39:42.393
He gave you everything
you needed to win those cases --

39:42.428 --> 39:44.929
witnesses, evidence,
anybody you needed to disappear.

39:44.964 --> 39:47.431
And all you had to do was bag
any case against him.

39:49.834 --> 39:51.735
Put your hands behind your back.

39:51.769 --> 39:54.504
You are under arrest
for the murder of Dante Moore.

39:54.538 --> 39:56.205
- We have a deal!
- There's not gonna be any deal.

39:56.240 --> 39:58.274
You cannot bring him down
unless I testify!

39:58.308 --> 40:00.843
We don't need you.
We've got my C.I.

40:07.851 --> 40:09.251
I want a lawyer.

40:10.554 --> 40:13.588
I hope you know someone
who's better at it than you are.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.494
You sure you don't want
a little hair of the dog?

40:19.528 --> 40:21.396
No, my head's still pounding.

40:21.430 --> 40:23.565
<i>O'Reilly: Valerie Delgado,
the assistant district attorney</i>

40:23.599 --> 40:26.601
<i>who was arrested today
for the murder of Dante Moore,</i>

40:26.635 --> 40:28.403
<i>will be arraigned tomorrow,</i>

40:28.437 --> 40:31.807
<i>all thanks to the work
of two of Boston's finest,</i>

40:31.841 --> 40:34.309
<i>detective Jane Rizzoli</i>

40:34.343 --> 40:35.776
<i>and sergeant detective
Vincent Korsak.</i>

40:35.810 --> 40:38.213
He's really very nice.

40:38.247 --> 40:40.648
<i>You'll remember these two initially
arrested drug dealer Terrance Jones...</i>

40:40.682 --> 40:42.716
Look, everybody!
That's my daughter, Jane!

40:42.751 --> 40:44.418
<i>Who is accused of murdering
community activist Elmore Gregory.</i>

40:44.452 --> 40:46.920
<i>A new prosecutor
has been assigned to the case.</i>

40:46.955 --> 40:49.490
<i>In the meantime...
O'Reilly's really not that bad.</i>

40:49.524 --> 40:50.958
My mother, on the other hand...

40:50.993 --> 40:52.493
Are you telling me you like him?

40:52.528 --> 40:54.262
Wha-- I am so gonna tell your mother.

40:54.296 --> 40:56.497
- Mnh-mnh.
- Tell me what?

40:56.532 --> 40:58.800
That you need a new hangout.

40:58.835 --> 41:00.602
Ohh!

41:00.637 --> 41:03.806
- Did you get your badge back?
- Yeah.

41:03.840 --> 41:05.307
Nice.

41:05.341 --> 41:07.743
You know, uh,
Angela really likes badges.

41:07.777 --> 41:09.244
She does?

41:09.278 --> 41:10.845
Ow! - I do.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.514
Don't you call them "badge bunnies"?

41:13.549 --> 41:14.749
I guess that makes me one.

41:14.783 --> 41:16.017
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe --

41:16.051 --> 41:17.651
do you even know what that means?

41:17.686 --> 41:21.020
Thank you, Maura.
Thank you very, very much.

41:21.055 --> 41:22.422
What? What did I do?

41:22.456 --> 41:24.591
You know, I think you just bruised

41:24.625 --> 41:26.493
my extensor hallucis longus.

41:26.527 --> 41:27.894
Good.

41:27.929 --> 41:30.397
- I don't even know what that is.
- What?

41:30.431 --> 41:32.700
<i>- I'm gonna bruise your...
- Don't you do it.</i>

41:32.734 --> 41:34.902
Ow!
