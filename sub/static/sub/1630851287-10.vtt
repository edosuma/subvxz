00:36.353 --> 00:38.612
Yeah. Real trees have curves.

00:38.706 --> 00:39.946
We need the branch strength.

00:40.099 --> 00:42.432
My handmade,
nondenominational holiday orbs

00:42.526 --> 00:43.600
are pretty heavy.

00:43.693 --> 00:44.710
Physically and emotionally.

00:44.861 --> 00:46.545
I know Christmas
is only two days away,

00:46.696 --> 00:49.606
but I was just waiting for him
to get to 14 feet.

00:49.699 --> 00:51.942
The perfect height for human
or Christmas tree.

00:52.035 --> 00:53.277
At my current rate of growth,

00:53.295 --> 00:55.370
I'll be 20 feet when I'm 35.

00:55.464 --> 00:58.115
Spruce Springsteen
is looking very handsome.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.966
Oh, heck yeah.
I'd let it happen.

01:00.119 --> 01:01.876
-What does that mean?
-Come on, Honeybee.

01:01.970 --> 01:03.136
This tree is smokin'.

01:03.289 --> 01:04.396
When you're right, you're right.

01:04.548 --> 01:06.640
Your gingerbread village
is already looking cute.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.049
Do you do this every year, Ham?

01:08.069 --> 01:10.794
Nope. Longtime eater,
first-time builder.

01:10.813 --> 01:13.054
Every Christmas,
the cake lady, which is me,

01:13.148 --> 01:15.240
builds a display for the
Maude's All-Day front window.

01:15.467 --> 01:17.725
I'm calling this
the "It Tastes a Village

01:17.745 --> 01:21.805
Lone Moose Christmas Gingerbread
Village Ham-stravaganza."

01:21.898 --> 01:23.248
I love a long title,

01:23.400 --> 01:25.475
like<i> Fried Green Tomatoes</i>
<i> at the Whistle Stop Cafe.</i>

01:25.569 --> 01:27.327
They could've just called it
"Vegetable Diner,"

01:27.421 --> 01:28.979
but instead she took it
to the limit.

01:29.072 --> 01:31.315
Huh. I must be nervous
about making this.

01:31.333 --> 01:32.649
I feel a little dizzy.

01:32.668 --> 01:34.259
-Honeybee, may I have a word?
-What's up?

01:34.411 --> 01:36.837
Is this a side conversation
or a panic room conversation?

01:36.989 --> 01:38.305
I'm not quite panicked yet,

01:38.432 --> 01:41.007
so let's have it
just outside the panic room.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.510
Christmas is
my favorite holiday.

01:43.662 --> 01:45.679
I love everything about it--
the lights, the food,

01:45.831 --> 01:47.998
ignoring the religious part
because I'm not religious.

01:48.091 --> 01:52.002
And I pride myself on getting
everyone the perfect present.

01:52.020 --> 01:54.929
But your brother Jerry,
he's a bit of a mystery to me.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.174
I went to all of
my favorite stores,

01:57.192 --> 01:59.176
and I wound up with this.

01:59.269 --> 02:01.695
(short laugh) Beef, my brother
owns four sweatshirts

02:01.847 --> 02:03.180
and a desktop computer.

02:03.273 --> 02:04.439
Why would you get him that?

02:04.533 --> 02:06.516
I guess he could use it
to break his computer.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.943
(groans) I just don't know
what Jerry likes.

02:09.037 --> 02:11.521
He's a quiet fellow
and I'm a quiet fellow,

02:11.540 --> 02:13.132
so I don't have
a lot of information.

02:13.359 --> 02:15.192
And you want me to tell you
what to get him

02:15.210 --> 02:16.468
so you don't have to
get out of your shell

02:16.620 --> 02:18.804
-and talk to him more.
-Uh... yes.

02:18.955 --> 02:20.305
Beef, take him out to dinner.

02:20.532 --> 02:22.957
Dinner with an adult
I don't know that well?

02:23.051 --> 02:25.460
Terrifying,
but I'm willing to try it

02:25.479 --> 02:28.147
if it'll help me secure
a good gift for Jerry.

02:28.298 --> 02:32.058
Tonight, I will invite him
to a friendship dinner.

02:32.211 --> 02:34.211
I'll make it steaks
so we're chewing a lot

02:34.229 --> 02:36.062
and there won't be
as much pressure to talk.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.214
There you go.

02:37.307 --> 02:38.657
<i> Diondra Tundra</i>

02:38.884 --> 02:41.809
reporting live. The 12 Days
of Lone Moose are well underway.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.055
Today featured the fishnog
tasting and the lighting of the

02:45.073 --> 02:46.740
<i> womenorah at</i>
<i> the feminist bookstore</i>

02:46.892 --> 02:48.667
<i> Desperately Reading Susan.</i>

02:48.894 --> 02:51.411
And tomorrow, the unveiling
of the Gingerbread village

02:51.505 --> 02:52.987
<i> in the window</i>
<i> at Maude's All-Day.</i>

02:53.081 --> 02:55.657
-(groans)
-Ham, are you feeling okay?

02:55.751 --> 02:58.418
(groans)
Am I feeling okay?

02:58.512 --> 03:00.846
Yep.
Lone Moose is counting on me,

03:00.997 --> 03:02.681
so I have to be feeling okay.

03:02.832 --> 03:04.016
Just one quick question:

03:04.167 --> 03:07.761
has this kitchen island
always been here?

03:08.580 --> 03:11.339
-Hi, Beef.
-Hello there to you, Jerry.

03:11.433 --> 03:13.841
Um, are you just coming
from a gig?

03:13.936 --> 03:17.011
Oh, no. I walked, and
I wore my costume to keep warm.

03:17.105 --> 03:18.438
You mind if I stash it
in your van?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.273
Course, the van's
just out front there.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.849
I don't like to wear it
while I'm eating.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.535
I learned my lesson
at Saucy Wings.

03:23.687 --> 03:26.096
The dry cleaning bill
was hundreds of dollars.

03:26.189 --> 03:27.748
BEEF:
Well...

03:28.767 --> 03:31.117
-Well.
-Well.

03:31.270 --> 03:35.196
So... it looks like
they have baked potatoes.

03:35.290 --> 03:38.199
Or salad for just $5.95.

03:38.293 --> 03:40.886
Mmm, this is good soup.

03:41.113 --> 03:43.947
And the soup spoons
are just the right depth.

03:43.966 --> 03:47.059
I love this table.
Nice.

03:47.210 --> 03:50.954
So, what do you like to do
when you're not Bigfooting?

03:50.973 --> 03:53.623
Well, I usually play computer
games with some online friends.

03:53.642 --> 03:56.217
And right now we're playing
<i> Super Ranch Hands Seven,</i>

03:56.311 --> 03:58.979
and I earned the trust
of Alan the pony today.

03:59.131 --> 04:01.240
What are your favorite
computer games, Beef?

04:01.391 --> 04:03.242
-Absolutely none.
-Oh. Okay.

04:03.469 --> 04:06.078
I tried<i> Minesweeper</i> once,
but it was so stressful

04:06.229 --> 04:08.488
that I returned the computer
to the store.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.566
-I'm more of an outdoor person.
-Hmm.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.827
So, Jerry,
have you looked around town

04:13.979 --> 04:17.647
at any of Lone Moose's stores
for Christmas presents?

04:17.666 --> 04:19.316
No, I'm not much of a shopper.

04:19.334 --> 04:22.986
Well, if you were in Fresno
for Christmas, wh...

04:23.005 --> 04:24.429
Oh, if I was in Fresno
for Christmas,

04:24.656 --> 04:26.247
I'd be working the holiday sale
at my parents' curtain store

04:26.300 --> 04:29.434
in the morning, and then it'd be
time for Christmas dip.

04:29.661 --> 04:31.828
-I love dip. What kind...
-Hold that thought.

04:31.847 --> 04:33.588
We got beef, Beef.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.332
Okay, that part's done.

04:35.350 --> 04:38.852
Now I'm just gonna lay on
the floor to gather my strength.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.261
Ham, you're burning up.

04:40.355 --> 04:43.949
How could I be burning up
if I'm also freezing cold?

04:44.100 --> 04:46.285
Okay, bud,
you are definitely sick.

04:46.512 --> 04:48.011
Let's get you into
that comfy chair.

04:48.104 --> 04:50.847
Oh, but who's gonna complete
the gingerbread village?

04:50.940 --> 04:52.349
It won't be Christmas
without it.

04:52.367 --> 04:54.701
(gasps) I can just see
the children of Lone Moose.

04:54.853 --> 04:58.038
Their faces pressed up
against the window, crying.

04:58.190 --> 05:00.782
Their tears freeze their faces
to the glass.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.375
And the grizzly bears get word

05:02.528 --> 05:04.469
and go to Maude's
and eat all the kids.

05:04.621 --> 05:07.047
Is that what you want
for Christmas? Is it?

05:07.141 --> 05:09.366
Ham, you're not making
any sense, friend.

05:09.384 --> 05:10.867
We'll finish it for you, okay?

05:10.960 --> 05:13.720
Okay. I drew a picture of it.
It's pretty self-explanatory.

05:13.814 --> 05:17.465
The recipes for the 78 animals
I haven't made yet are on there.

05:17.559 --> 05:19.376
All you have to do
is carve them,

05:19.394 --> 05:20.968
bake 'em, and decorate them

05:21.063 --> 05:23.213
and don't forget to,
uh, fram the gum.

05:23.306 --> 05:24.731
Sorry, wha-what's "fram"?

05:24.883 --> 05:26.716
You just have to gram
the frum da boo ba da...

05:26.810 --> 05:28.385
Uh-oh, we're losing him.

05:28.478 --> 05:30.812
-(snoring)
-Guys, this actually looks
really hard.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.072
We'll have to fake it
till we bake it.

05:32.224 --> 05:33.981
Lone Moose Christmas
is counting on us.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.668
Thanks for dinner.
I had a good time.

05:36.820 --> 05:38.745
Me too. And thanks
for telling me about

05:38.897 --> 05:40.505
that fishing simulator game.

05:40.657 --> 05:42.824
It would be a perfect gift
for me,

05:42.843 --> 05:47.679
but, uh, what would be a perfect
gift for, I don't know, you?

05:47.831 --> 05:49.756
Oh, no,
why is the van door open?

05:49.908 --> 05:51.758
I swear I remember closing it.

05:51.910 --> 05:54.669
No. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

05:54.763 --> 05:56.563
Oh, my Bigfoot costume's gone!

05:59.267 --> 06:01.084
Who would want
a Bigfoot costume?

06:01.086 --> 06:02.394
I mean, besides me,

06:02.396 --> 06:03.770
who is Bigfoot at parties
for a living.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.106
I'm sorry, Jerry.
I invite you to dinner

06:06.258 --> 06:07.440
and now your costume is stolen.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.350
And I have a couple of jobs
coming up.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.352
I mean, I can't just
show up as myself.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.263
I mean, they'll be like,
"Who's this guy?"

06:13.281 --> 06:15.707
Oh, I left my phone
inside Bigfoot.

06:15.934 --> 06:17.601
-Beef, can I use yours?
-Of course.

06:17.619 --> 06:19.711
It's cracked,
but it's got good bones.

06:19.863 --> 06:21.195
I can use the Find My Phone app.

06:21.289 --> 06:23.548
My phone can find other phones?

06:23.700 --> 06:25.275
I don't want
to owe a machine a favor.

06:25.293 --> 06:27.944
-There it is.
-Huh. Looks like
it's at Winter World.

06:28.037 --> 06:29.054
What's Winter World?

06:29.205 --> 06:31.038
The year-round Christmas
theme park.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.225
Originally, it was
called Water World,

06:33.376 --> 06:35.727
but Kevin Costner sued.
So they drained it,

06:35.879 --> 06:37.470
threw in a bunch of
Christmas trees with eyeballs,

06:37.623 --> 06:40.047
-and called it Winter World.
-Let's go.

06:40.142 --> 06:42.459
-(snoring)
-So, we've cooked all
the gingerbread sheets.

06:42.552 --> 06:45.311
Now we just have to carve
78 Christmas animals.

06:45.464 --> 06:47.739
Okay, let me take a crack
at a salmon.

06:47.891 --> 06:50.075
Oh, no. I think we were supposed
to cut them into cookie shapes

06:50.226 --> 06:51.651
before we put them in the oven.

06:51.803 --> 06:52.911
Aw, mistleturd!

06:53.062 --> 06:54.228
Hey, guys, I did it.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.248
-Amazing. What is it?
-It's an otter.

06:56.399 --> 06:58.750
Oh, sure. Yeah, now I see it.
It's just upside down.

06:58.902 --> 06:59.918
Mm... No, it's not.

07:00.069 --> 07:01.311
Let's all just
do the best we can.

07:01.404 --> 07:03.163
Everyone choose a shape
and go for it.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.498
Great 'tude,
my dearly beloved wife dude.

07:05.651 --> 07:08.242
This Christmas train
is back on track.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.170
(singsongy):
Ho, ho!

07:10.264 --> 07:12.413
Sorry, we're closed
for a private event.

07:12.507 --> 07:14.324
Oh, but something
was stolen from me,

07:14.417 --> 07:16.509
and I think someone
in your park has it.

07:16.662 --> 07:18.753
My boss will go nuts
if I let anyone in, sorry.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.105
You can wait in the parking lot

07:20.332 --> 07:21.589
and try to catch people
as they leave.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.757
Just brainstorming.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.350
I'm an ideas guy.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.836
Yes, good idea.
Come along, Jerry.

07:26.855 --> 07:30.173
Normally I wouldn't trespass,
but this is an emergency.

07:30.266 --> 07:33.285
And I think I know
how we can blend in.

07:34.196 --> 07:36.270
Hey, what are you doing
over here?

07:36.331 --> 07:38.198
Everyone is supposed to be
working the party.

07:38.350 --> 07:40.292
Oh, of course.
We're on our way.

07:40.485 --> 07:42.127
Why are you walking
toward the penguin pool?

07:42.354 --> 07:44.445
Oh, please don't steal
the penguin, guys.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.372
If the penguin gets stolen
again this year,

07:46.525 --> 07:47.874
I'm gonna get in big trouble.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.617
Now can you just head
to the food court?

07:49.711 --> 07:50.802
This is pretty fun.

07:50.954 --> 07:52.471
I've never been
undercover before.

07:52.622 --> 07:54.380
I just hope
we don't get in too deep.

07:54.533 --> 07:55.865
Mary Stuart Masterson.

07:55.884 --> 07:59.703
What is this? Some sort of
bizarro Santa Burning Man?

07:59.796 --> 08:01.538
JERRY:
I'm not sure,

08:01.556 --> 08:02.872
but one of
these strange St. Nick's

08:02.891 --> 08:04.483
-probably has my phone.
-(laughter)

08:04.710 --> 08:06.543
It's way too loud to just call
it and try to hear where it is.

08:06.561 --> 08:09.879
I think what we have to do
is go person-to-person,

08:09.898 --> 08:11.064
and while we're talking to them,

08:11.158 --> 08:12.716
I'll call the phone
and see if we hear a ring.

08:12.734 --> 08:15.902
-Are you talking about mingling?
-I-I hate it, too, Beef.

08:16.054 --> 08:20.147
-Ooh, why don't we grab
a cup of conversation sauce?
-Great idea.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.984
A little alcohol should add
some jingle to our mingle.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.837
Gentlemen, a cup of
Terry Claus' famous punch?

08:26.064 --> 08:27.230
Uh, sure.

08:27.916 --> 08:30.416
Mmm. Lot of brown
solid bits in here.

08:30.569 --> 08:32.085
Don't let it faze you,
act natural.

08:32.237 --> 08:33.512
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

08:33.663 --> 08:35.847
All right,
we're both afraid to mingle,

08:36.074 --> 08:38.833
but we'll do it together.
Safety in numbers.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.577
Well...

08:40.595 --> 08:42.929
-Well.
-Well.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.841
Uh, are you guys trying
to start a conversation or...

08:46.860 --> 08:48.268
Yes. Exactly.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.937
Why aren't you guys in
your Terry Claus outfits?

08:51.089 --> 08:52.197
Who's Terry Claus?

08:52.348 --> 08:54.758
He's what this party's
all about, man.

08:54.776 --> 08:56.276
We throw it every December 23.

08:56.428 --> 08:58.245
Terry Claus
is the real Santa Claus.

08:58.430 --> 09:00.280
His workshop is right here
in our town.

09:00.432 --> 09:02.557
He has a flying moose,
a brown animal skin suit,

09:02.559 --> 09:04.859
and his beard is blue
because he's cool like that.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.194
Every year
we dress as Terry Claus,

09:07.214 --> 09:08.621
we drink his traditional punch,

09:08.774 --> 09:11.775
-and later we go to Claudia's
for the orgy.
-Okay.

09:11.793 --> 09:13.443
(whispers): Call the phone,
Jerry, call the phone.

09:13.461 --> 09:15.945
Oh, I'm starting to feel weird.

09:16.039 --> 09:17.280
How much alcohol is in this?

09:17.299 --> 09:18.756
None.
It's drugs.

09:18.983 --> 09:21.117
Oh, uh, great.
I love drugs.

09:21.136 --> 09:22.918
Which drugs are in here?

09:22.920 --> 09:23.878
Mushrooms, man.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.122
Uh, okay,
great talking with you.

09:26.141 --> 09:27.715
I have no experience with drugs.

09:27.809 --> 09:29.959
-I'm nervous.
-I've never done drugs, either.

09:30.053 --> 09:31.644
But based on a video
Honeybee took of me

09:31.797 --> 09:33.479
after I got my wisdom teeth
pulled out,

09:33.632 --> 09:36.223
-I get pretty weird.
-Well, let's not panic.

09:36.318 --> 09:37.801
We got through meeting
that stranger together.

09:37.819 --> 09:40.804
We'll get through
this psychedelic trip together.

09:40.897 --> 09:42.247
All right, everybody.
Time to kick off

09:42.474 --> 09:44.749
the Lone Moose Terry Claus
karaoke competition.

09:44.901 --> 09:48.903
♪<i> Terry Claus, Terry Claus</i> ♪

09:48.922 --> 09:51.981
♪<i> He sees you</i>

09:52.000 --> 09:55.151

10:01.435 --> 10:02.842
Wow.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.919
I know.
Wow.

10:04.938 --> 10:09.015
I-I feel like there's something
we're supposed to be doing.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.850
Yeah, what is our purpose?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.836
No, I mean,
I think there's something

10:12.854 --> 10:14.929
we're supposed to be doing
at this party.

10:15.023 --> 10:17.949
But all I can picture is,
like, a large foot.

10:18.059 --> 10:21.177
(gasps) And it has a face,
and it's weeping.

10:21.270 --> 10:24.122
Huh. A big... foot.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.683
-Bigfoot!
-Oh, right, right.

10:26.701 --> 10:29.127
We need to find my costume.
We have to call the phone.

10:29.278 --> 10:30.962
Yes, that's what we were doing.

10:31.114 --> 10:33.298
-(phone ringing)
-I think I hear it ringing.

10:33.525 --> 10:34.966
It's closer.

10:35.193 --> 10:37.969
(chuckles): Look, Jerry,
your favorite-- Christmas dip.

10:38.121 --> 10:39.529
Not now, Beef.

10:39.622 --> 10:42.474
-Hey!
-(panting)

10:44.719 --> 10:46.536
(gasps)
Potato Patty?

10:46.554 --> 10:47.704
You know this person?

10:47.797 --> 10:49.722
You got me, Jerry.
You got me.

10:49.875 --> 10:52.192
Can I have my beard back now?
It's a rental.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.973
Potato Patty? You took my
costume? You took my phone?

10:58.992 --> 11:01.159
-It's almost Christmas.
-I did.

11:01.310 --> 11:03.386
Why are you calling her
Potato Patty?

11:03.405 --> 11:06.331
Oh, because she dresses
as a potato and holds the sign

11:06.441 --> 11:08.408
outside the Loaded Baked Potato
Juice Booth at the mall.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.451
I know that place.
I got diarrhea from there.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.153
Yup.
Potato juice will do that.

11:12.247 --> 11:13.487
Where's my Bigfoot costume?

11:13.507 --> 11:15.581
I don't have it.
Dick Chateau does.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.008
Who's Dick Chateau?

11:17.160 --> 11:19.752
Richard Chateau is the richest
person in Lone Moose.

11:19.846 --> 11:23.573
He's a local big game hunter
and lives in Chateau Chateau.

11:23.591 --> 11:25.425
Why would a rich dude
want my costume?

11:25.519 --> 11:27.501
And why would you
take it for him, Patty?

11:27.595 --> 11:28.761
Eh, I didn't take it.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.337
I just told him
it was in the van.

11:30.432 --> 11:32.006
And then I watched him take it.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.416
He let me keep the phone
as a tip.

11:33.418 --> 11:35.268
How could you
go against the costume code?

11:35.420 --> 11:36.920
We're supposed to look out
for one another.

11:36.938 --> 11:38.938
It's easy to believe
in the costume code

11:39.090 --> 11:41.182
when you have a great costume
like Bigfoot.

11:41.276 --> 11:43.459
My costume is awful.

11:43.519 --> 11:45.929
I do remember your potato suit
looking like--

11:46.022 --> 11:47.205
and forgive me--

11:47.356 --> 11:49.190
an open wound topped
with chives and cheese.

11:49.284 --> 11:52.860
There's also a really gross
translucent sour cream swirl.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.496
Anyway, you'll have to go see
him if you want it back. Bye.

11:55.607 --> 11:56.864
Not so fast, Patty.

11:56.958 --> 11:59.718
You're coming with us
to help get that costume back.

11:59.869 --> 12:01.386
Fine, but I get to ride shotgun.

12:01.613 --> 12:05.206
Actually, we need you to drive
because we both drank mushrooms.

12:05.300 --> 12:08.634
Jerry just now stopped looking
like pure energy to me.

12:08.787 --> 12:11.378
Okay, we are well on our way
to saving Christmas,

12:11.398 --> 12:13.806
but now we are out of...
everything.

12:13.959 --> 12:15.458
So we're gonna
have to improvise.

12:15.477 --> 12:17.460
We were supposed
to do gumdrop rooftops,

12:17.479 --> 12:20.739
but what about-- hear me out--
salami shingles?

12:20.966 --> 12:22.131
I have a bunch of bird bones.

12:22.225 --> 12:24.300
We could use those to make
the candy cane fences.

12:24.319 --> 12:26.060
They're not edible,
but they're clean.

12:26.154 --> 12:27.320
And I've got some press-on nails

12:27.472 --> 12:28.972
that could make
for a colorful walkway.

12:29.065 --> 12:30.248
Can I just say,
I love Ham's vision,

12:30.399 --> 12:33.067
but...
we might be improving it.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.401
Oh, it's a glow-up for sure.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.571
JERRY:
So, this is
Dick Castle's castle?

12:37.591 --> 12:39.315
Dick Chateau's chateau.

12:39.334 --> 12:42.318
-Eh, potato, "potahto."
-Ugh! I hate that saying.

12:42.337 --> 12:44.078
No one's ever said "potahto,"
and you know it.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.764
-So, what's
the plan here, anyway?
-Simple.

12:45.991 --> 12:48.341
We ask Dick for Jerry's costume,
and then we leave.

12:48.493 --> 12:50.268
Oh, yeah, I'm sure the rich guy

12:50.495 --> 12:52.345
who paid me
to steal a Bigfoot costume

12:52.497 --> 12:53.830
is just gonna
hand it over to us.

12:53.923 --> 12:55.348
Hello and welcome
to Chateau Chateau.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.925
I'm the butler, Karen Butler.
How may I help you?

12:58.019 --> 13:00.945
Hello. We're here to speak
with Richard Chateau.

13:01.097 --> 13:03.006
He has my young friend's
costume.

13:03.024 --> 13:04.340
(sighs)
Fine.

13:04.433 --> 13:05.766
I'm gonna have you wait in here.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.678
But when I open the door,
please don't gasp.

13:08.696 --> 13:10.346
Gasping is my pet peeve.

13:10.439 --> 13:12.532
-(all gasp)
-What did I just say? (groans)

13:12.684 --> 13:13.958
I'll go get Mr. Chateau.

13:14.110 --> 13:15.960
What is this?

13:16.112 --> 13:17.444
Oh, I remember this costume.

13:17.539 --> 13:20.540
He was the party store's
discount Barney, named Blarney.

13:20.692 --> 13:23.450
And there's Billy Bratt
the Butter Pat from Toast by Jan

13:23.545 --> 13:26.379
and Certifiably Elaine
from the notary.

13:26.531 --> 13:27.880
I love costumes,

13:27.974 --> 13:30.809
but this collection--
how can I put this--

13:31.036 --> 13:32.477
-feels psychotic.
-CHATEAU: Thank you.

13:32.704 --> 13:35.296
-(groups gasps)
-Guys, again, the gasps.

13:35.315 --> 13:39.208
Well, hello there
"Potahto" Patty and friends.

13:39.260 --> 13:41.468
-Does he have a British accent?
-Indeed.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.654
Is he British?

13:42.881 --> 13:44.322
No, he's originally from Seward.

13:44.473 --> 13:47.567
Is this a costume?
Hmm. It's very lifelike.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.661
Um, no.
I'm a human man.

13:49.812 --> 13:51.162
I'll take your word for it.

13:51.314 --> 13:52.831
What is it that brings you
to the chateau

13:53.058 --> 13:54.499
this holiday afore night?

13:54.650 --> 13:57.318
You have something of mine.
My Bigfoot costume.

13:57.412 --> 14:00.171
Ah, yes.
I finally bagged my white whale.

14:00.323 --> 14:02.823
-Why do you steal costumes?
-For the hunt.

14:02.917 --> 14:06.327
-Allow me to explain myself
at length.
-Oh, boy.

14:06.421 --> 14:09.072
I was once
an actual big game hunter.

14:09.165 --> 14:10.348
I traveled all over Alaska,

14:10.499 --> 14:12.258
killing some of
its most beautiful animals.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.576
Then Game Warden Burt said

14:13.669 --> 14:15.912
I'm no longer
legally allowed to hunt

14:15.930 --> 14:18.022
just because I was shooting
endangered species.

14:18.174 --> 14:21.175
I was so bored, I barely
had any blood on my hands.

14:21.269 --> 14:23.252
It was terrible.
Then one day,

14:23.346 --> 14:26.680
<i> I spotted the mascot</i>
<i>for the Polar Bear panini shop.</i>

14:26.700 --> 14:29.092
<i> Sure, he makes no sense--</i>
<i> Why would a polar bear make</i>

14:29.185 --> 14:30.517
<i> a hot sandwich?</i>

14:30.612 --> 14:32.095
To stay warm or to eat it.

14:32.113 --> 14:33.613
Please do not respond
to my musings.

14:33.765 --> 14:37.934
<i> I saw that enormous, gorgeous</i>
<i> white-hot sandwich bear.</i>

14:38.027 --> 14:39.377
<i> I had to have him.</i>

14:39.528 --> 14:41.528
<i> The bear's human inhabitant</i>
<i> stored the costume</i>

14:41.548 --> 14:43.548
<i> in an unlocked shed.</i>
<i> I nabbed it,</i>

14:43.699 --> 14:46.533
<i> and suddenly I felt like</i>
<i> Dick Chateau again.</i>

14:46.553 --> 14:49.278
And I've been collecting
ever since.

14:49.297 --> 14:52.206
But you-- your costume
is always locked away

14:52.300 --> 14:54.283
or upon your person.

14:54.302 --> 14:55.801
But tonight...
(clicks tongue)

14:55.954 --> 14:59.455
you let your guard down
and left it in an unlocked van.

14:59.474 --> 15:01.733
Oh, no, I did leave
the van unlocked.

15:01.884 --> 15:05.144
I guess I was distracted.
I was nervous about our dinner.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.463
You were nervous
about having dinner with me?

15:07.482 --> 15:08.648
I'm just Beef.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.224
But to be honest,
I was pretty nervous, too.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.743
Oh.
Well, I understand.

15:11.970 --> 15:15.304
I'm pretty shy and a one-on-one
dinner was a lot of pressure,

15:15.323 --> 15:17.473
-but I think...
-Hey, shy boys.

15:17.492 --> 15:18.641
Dick Chateau talking.

15:18.734 --> 15:21.235
We just need to get
Jerry's costume back.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.812
-We're willing to pay you any...
-No.

15:22.830 --> 15:26.090
This was my Christmas gift
to myself. The perfect present.

15:26.242 --> 15:27.442
The perfect present can't be

15:27.444 --> 15:29.427
something you stole
from someone else.

15:29.654 --> 15:31.745
It has to be
a carefully curated choice,

15:31.765 --> 15:33.673
made to make someone else
very happy

15:33.825 --> 15:35.324
for just a brief shining moment.

15:35.418 --> 15:36.826
It doesn't have to be expensive.

15:36.844 --> 15:40.663
It just has to say, "Hey, man,
I see you and I get you."

15:40.682 --> 15:43.015
It's the frigging spirit
of frigging Christmas.

15:43.168 --> 15:44.517
Sorry, could you repeat that?

15:44.669 --> 15:45.926
-I dozed off.
-Damn it.

15:46.020 --> 15:47.928
Look, is there anything
we can offer you?

15:48.022 --> 15:48.929
Some kind of trade?

15:49.056 --> 15:50.339
Hmm.
A trade.

15:50.433 --> 15:52.024
Perhaps I could
give back the costume

15:52.118 --> 15:55.344
in exchange for you
indulging in the Moltening.

15:55.438 --> 15:58.272
-Get the Moltening sacks.
-BEEF: Moltening sack?

15:58.366 --> 16:00.533
You all wear costumes
on the outside.

16:00.627 --> 16:04.445
What if you knew what your
costumes were on the inside?

16:04.539 --> 16:06.447
Are you gonna
perform surgery on us?

16:06.541 --> 16:08.967
No.
Although that's a fun idea.

16:09.194 --> 16:10.802
Stop talking.

16:10.953 --> 16:13.137
Oh, no, he's gonna
put us in bags.

16:13.364 --> 16:14.806
Yes, but not in a bad way.

16:14.957 --> 16:17.141
Step one, you will
don this nude hosiery.

16:17.368 --> 16:19.460
Step two,
I will cover you in glue.

16:19.554 --> 16:21.762
Step three, you will
enter these burlap sacks

16:21.815 --> 16:25.632
filled with feathers, glitter,
googly eyes and paint.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.486
My butler will then
tie them shut around your neck,

16:28.637 --> 16:32.215
and you will have to wriggle
your way out of the cocoon

16:32.308 --> 16:34.250
and emerge in your true form.

16:34.252 --> 16:36.235
Then, you shall
remove that costume,

16:36.329 --> 16:37.903
and I will hang it upon my wall.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.497
A one of a kind treasure

16:39.724 --> 16:43.317
that no other costume hunter
in the world owns.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.062
There are no other
costume hunters in the world.

16:46.155 --> 16:47.580
Beef, we don't have to do this.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.081
We've come so far tonight.

16:49.234 --> 16:52.068
We had dinner together.
We snuck into an amusement park.

16:52.086 --> 16:55.404
We drank drugs
for the first and last time

16:55.498 --> 16:57.348
because I did not enjoy it.
We mingled.

16:57.500 --> 16:58.924
And you know what?
I had fun.

16:59.077 --> 17:01.185
I say we push ourselves
one more time,

17:01.337 --> 17:04.171
get in these bags,
and get your costume back.

17:04.265 --> 17:05.748
Are you sure
you're not still high?

17:05.767 --> 17:07.674
Oh, I am definitely still high.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.694
But I also believe
in what I'm saying.

17:09.845 --> 17:11.571
All right then.
Let's molt.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.702
Well, have fun moltening.
I'll see you in several days.

17:18.096 --> 17:19.595
Days?
But we'll miss Christmas.

17:19.688 --> 17:22.431
(scoffs) The elephant seal
takes 30 days to molt.

17:22.450 --> 17:24.934
-Consider yourselves lucky.
-(door closes)

17:24.952 --> 17:28.212
You guys, uh, want to play
a guessing game or something?

17:28.364 --> 17:31.440
Hey, I'm thinking of a number
between one and one billion.

17:31.459 --> 17:34.944
-Jerry, take a guess.
-I don't know. 12?

17:34.962 --> 17:36.112
Right. Huh.

17:36.130 --> 17:38.130
What should we do now?

17:38.224 --> 17:39.615
(grunts)
Boy, this is tight.

17:39.708 --> 17:42.709
Now I understand why
mummies are mad all the time.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.136
We have got to get out of here.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.213
We can't miss Christmas
with the family.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.792
Yeah, I'm also very worried
that gentleman will kill us.

17:49.811 --> 17:52.144
-(sobbing)
-What's wrong?

17:52.297 --> 17:54.221
Other than being trapped
in a sack.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.798
I just feel terrible.

17:55.817 --> 17:59.059
I tried to act like it was okay
before, but it's not okay.

17:59.153 --> 18:00.636
I broke the costume code

18:00.729 --> 18:03.247
because Dick Chateau
offered me 40 bucks.

18:03.474 --> 18:06.492
-40 bucks?
-And a two liter of Pepsi.

18:06.644 --> 18:07.901
Have you had a Pepsi?

18:07.995 --> 18:09.312
It's so good.

18:09.330 --> 18:12.815
I'm sorry. I... I'm stupid
and I'm a potato.

18:12.908 --> 18:15.651
(sighs)
You're not stupid, Patty.

18:15.744 --> 18:17.153
And you're not really a potato.

18:17.171 --> 18:18.412
I want to make it up
to you guys.

18:18.506 --> 18:20.747
I think we can escape
and find the costume.

18:20.842 --> 18:23.750
Follow me. Quietly.
(grunts)

18:23.770 --> 18:25.328
-(grunting)
-I can actually

18:25.421 --> 18:26.804
open the door with my mouth.
My old potato outfit

18:26.915 --> 18:31.258
didn't allow arm movement,
so I got pretty good at it.

18:32.428 --> 18:35.113
I can also open the door
to my Corolla with my chin.

18:35.264 --> 18:36.989
(all grunting)

18:38.009 --> 18:40.176
Okay, guys, look out.
Stairs.

18:40.194 --> 18:43.512
-We just have to go
for it-it-it-it-it...
-(grunting)

18:43.531 --> 18:46.015
Oh. I could have just
untied these with my mouth.

18:46.033 --> 18:48.459
(chuckles)
But the stairs were fun, right?

18:48.686 --> 18:50.128
Open the bags, Patty.

18:51.614 --> 18:52.613
There she is!

18:52.632 --> 18:53.873
You guys escaping?

18:54.025 --> 18:55.115
-No.
-Calm down.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.542
I'll help you.
It's Christmas,

18:56.636 --> 18:58.878
and you're the nicest captives
we've ever had.

18:59.030 --> 19:02.289
-(bell chimes)
-CHATEAU: Butler, I'm coming
down for my bedtime fruits.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.867
-Hurry, go.
-Thank you!

19:04.886 --> 19:05.977
(panting)

19:06.204 --> 19:07.461
Oh, my God, it's freezing.

19:07.555 --> 19:10.148
I haven't been this cold
since my last Christmas dip.

19:10.299 --> 19:11.983
Why would Christmas dip
make you cold?

19:12.134 --> 19:14.393
"Christmas dip" is when
me and my dad take a dip

19:14.545 --> 19:16.061
in the Pacific Ocean
on Christmas.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.047
Crazy cold but also crazy fun.

19:18.065 --> 19:20.549
I'm pretty bummed
that I can't do it this year.

19:20.568 --> 19:22.735
-(sobbing)
-Now what's wrong?

19:22.887 --> 19:26.313
I'm just sad you can't do your
Christmas dip with your dad.

19:26.407 --> 19:28.148
CHATEAU:
Come back, my beauties!

19:28.209 --> 19:29.241
-(gunshot)
-Is he shooting at us?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.501
-JERRY: I told you.
-Go! Move!

19:30.728 --> 19:32.578
-Go, go, go, go!
-Drive, drive, drive, drive!

19:32.730 --> 19:34.397
JERRY:
Hey, look, it's after midnight.

19:34.415 --> 19:37.592
Merry Christmas Eve, everybody.

19:39.828 --> 19:41.904
(gasps)
They did it! Wow.

19:41.997 --> 19:43.739
I can't believe
they were able to...

19:43.758 --> 19:44.757
Oh, no.

19:44.909 --> 19:46.909
-Are those pepperonis?
-Yep.

19:46.928 --> 19:50.262
-(yawning)
-You're looking at
a Christmas miracle, bud.

19:50.415 --> 19:51.672
Oh. Hmm.

19:51.766 --> 19:53.249
Now, can anyone walk me through

19:53.267 --> 19:54.859
why half of this village
is burned down

19:55.086 --> 19:56.176
while the other half is wet?

19:56.270 --> 19:58.270
Yes, we decided
to make the womenorah

19:58.423 --> 19:59.846
and tried to light it,
but that started a fire.

19:59.941 --> 20:03.016
And Honeybee bravely put it out,
but it flooded half the village.

20:03.110 --> 20:06.595
Wow.
It's all so beautiful.

20:06.614 --> 20:08.706
Yeah, I could never
part with this.

20:08.933 --> 20:10.449
I'm gonna quickly
make another one,

20:10.601 --> 20:14.712
and we can just keep
this beautiful treasure for us.

20:14.863 --> 20:16.439
So, we can eat this one?
Mmm. Mmm.

20:16.532 --> 20:19.050
Hey, who's idea was it to cut up
the kitchen sponge?

20:19.201 --> 20:21.777
Because it's not bad.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.229
Yes, a Christmas dip.

20:31.456 --> 20:33.622
Well, thanks, Beef.
It's perfect.

20:33.716 --> 20:34.899
A carefully chosen gift

20:35.050 --> 20:37.235
to give me moment
of perfect happiness.

20:37.386 --> 20:39.570
-You nailed it.
-Thank God I didn't hammer it.

20:39.722 --> 20:42.631
I say that because I originally
bought you a hammer.

20:42.725 --> 20:45.892
Oh, yeah, that would've been
a real bad gift.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.078
