00:12.012 --> 00:13.638
<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty:

00:13.722 --> 00:15.223
-Hello, Daddy.
-Kirby.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.350
-You have an older brother.
-You're the only one

00:17.434 --> 00:19.477
-that knows I'm not the real deal.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.146
-Maybe.
-Steven, I'm pregnant.

00:21.229 --> 00:24.232
-You're going to be a father.
-You're a Carrington, Jeff.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.401
We're Carringtons.
We're here for what's ours.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.653
I motion that we put the sale
of the company to a vote.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.864
-I'll contest the sale.
-I'm switching my vote.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.116
Liam's uncle has connections in Big Oil.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.869
-I'm in love with you, Fallon.
-Claudia, don't!

00:40.457 --> 00:41.458
-Fallon!
-Culhane!

00:41.541 --> 00:43.626
-Alexis!
Blake, take Fallon.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.004
Oh, my God! Cristal!

00:47.797 --> 00:49.674
-Steven!
Culhane!

00:55.221 --> 00:56.347
<i>♪ You should see me ♪</i>

00:57.474 --> 01:00.101
Fallon, can we get a comment?
A comment?

01:00.185 --> 01:03.563
Information on the fire?

01:03.646 --> 01:06.066
Any word on the sale
and your stake in the company?

01:06.149 --> 01:08.985
Do you consider yourself
part of the Carrington family?

01:09.069 --> 01:12.447
No. My sister and I
do not consider ourselves Carringtons.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.406
Hell, no.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.534
Rumors of Mr. Carrington's
mental breakdown or drug-fueled Parisian bender
are exactly that.

01:20.080 --> 01:20.955

01:58.576 --> 02:02.997
So, that is what
a $50-billion-deal memo looks like.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.542
Yep. I got it from Legal this morning.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.878
I'm meeting with Liam's uncle today
to negotiate details.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.048
Our hope is we can announce
the transition at CA's anniversary party.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.633
And that is why I love you.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.971
You talk about selling a hundred-year-old
empire like a kid selling lemonade.

02:18.054 --> 02:21.266
-You should have seen me sell lemonade.
I bet.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.310
Now, before I got
understandably distracted...

02:24.394 --> 02:28.189
I did come up here to tell you
that your father is on his way home.

02:29.858 --> 02:30.942
Of course.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.779
He abandons his family
while everything's going to hell,

02:34.863 --> 02:37.448
but when it comes to the company,
he'll be there.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.869
You know,
he's the very reason CA became so toxic.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.079
He raised us to fight each other for it.

02:45.165 --> 02:49.460
I would never wanna do that to my kids.
Don't worry. I'm not pregnant.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.548
Baby...

02:54.799 --> 02:55.758
I'm proud of you.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.220
-Even if Blake isn't.
-He lost his opinion

02:59.304 --> 03:01.931
when he left me
to pick up the pieces for a month.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.976
As if he was the only one
who lost Cristal.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.980
<i>The nationwide manhunt</i>
<i>continues for Hank Sullivan,</i>

03:09.063 --> 03:11.566
<i>person of interest</i>
<i>in Cristal Carrington's homicide.</i>

03:12.233 --> 03:15.862
<i>Investigators on the case question</i>
<i>whether the suspect acted alone.</i>

03:15.945 --> 03:18.114
Mrs. Carrington, guess what I have.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.451
-Your discharge papers.
No.

03:21.534 --> 03:25.038
You've made a full recovery
from your smoke inhalation two weeks ago.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.916
I'm really not sure why you're still here.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.083
What if I get worse?

03:29.542 --> 03:30.877
I can't afford a relapse.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.713
I think you've milked the Carrington tab
long enough.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.759
How about I send someone to carry
the flowers you sent yourself?

03:37.842 --> 03:39.969
<i>...his mother, Alexis Carrington,</i>
<i>who is recovering...</i>

03:40.053 --> 03:42.472
It's my interview. It's on. Out, out, out.

03:42.555 --> 03:46.476
<i>The police think</i>
<i>that Cristal learned of his plan</i>

03:46.559 --> 03:50.647
<i>to take out</i>
<i>the Carrington Atlantic shareholders,</i>

03:50.730 --> 03:51.606
<i>and...</i>

03:52.899 --> 03:53.942
<i>well, he reacted.</i>

03:57.403 --> 04:01.532
<i>Hank, if you're seeing this,</i>
<i>please call me.</i>

04:02.200 --> 04:04.786
<i>We will get through this together.</i>

04:04.869 --> 04:08.039
<i>I mean, I'd do it all over again</i>
<i>if I could save poor Celia.</i>

04:08.414 --> 04:09.666
<i>You mean Cristal Flores.</i>

04:10.833 --> 04:14.879
<i>Well, who is she, really?</i>
<i>A tortured soul with a hard life.</i>

04:15.546 --> 04:16.756
<i>A stolen identity.</i>

04:17.590 --> 04:19.050
<i>But as Mother Teresa said:</i>

04:20.051 --> 04:22.679
<i>"Do things for people</i>
<i>not because of who they are</i>

04:23.263 --> 04:25.640
<i>-but because of who you are."</i>
-"But because of who you are."

04:28.851 --> 04:32.272
Whether or not you accept
you're the father, I'm starting to show.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.983
And with my divorce being finalized,

04:35.525 --> 04:37.735
you know,
people might ask whose kid it is.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.697
And I'm not gonna lie.
It's not fair to the baby.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.573
It's not that I don't believe you.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.660
-Well, now that you have medical evidence.
-It's just...

04:48.246 --> 04:51.666
I don't know how to tell Sam.
After all he's been through?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.918
I am sympathetic to Sam's loss.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.504
Don't get me wrong.
But think of it this way:

04:56.587 --> 05:00.133
The longer you lie, it's gonna be
much worse when the truth come out.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.344
And it will come out.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.150
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.864
And I was worried
this was gonna be awkward.

05:23.364 --> 05:27.243
Liam, I really appreciate everything
you're doing to help broker this deal.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.662
Despite my... decision.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.872
To not be with me.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.583
Yes. See? It's much less awkward now.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.502
This place is popular.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.630
My uncle bought it out.
He doesn't like to eat with other people.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.759
There's one little hang-up.

05:42.842 --> 05:46.637
Just a small miscommunication
I just found out about myself.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.307
Don't tell me he's getting cold feet.
I need this to work.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.517
-Liam.
-Good. Good to see you.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.730
This must be Fallon.

05:55.813 --> 05:56.689
-Hi.
-The legend.

05:58.232 --> 06:01.235
Sorry what's happened to your family.
I'm glad I can help.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.988
Oh, thank you.
Is this your first time to Atlanta?

06:04.072 --> 06:06.699
Oh, no. I have developments
up and down the Eastern seaboard.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.743
Imports, exports, that sort of thing.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.871
And this isn't the first time
I dipped a toe into Big Oil.

06:11.996 --> 06:16.375
-Oh. I didn't know that.
-Well, the last seller screwed me over.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.920
Once you get on my bad side,

06:19.003 --> 06:21.464
you'll wish you never heard
of the Van Kirks.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.217
-I'm lucky to have Liam's help.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.512
He's lucky he has a wife
who's heir to an empire I wanna buy.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.889
I'm famished. Let's eat.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.560
Your wife?

06:39.273 --> 06:41.526
<i>I saw your message on TV.</i>

06:43.986 --> 06:45.780
Could you get me a toiletries bag?

06:47.365 --> 06:48.533
And some toiletries.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.785
And shut that door on the way out.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.874
Finally. You idiot.
Why didn't you call me sooner?

06:57.333 --> 07:00.503
<i></i>
-I didn't kill her.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.340
The news said she died of a gunshot wound.
That wasn't me. I just torched the place.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.926
Oh, my God, Hank.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.554
You said to take care of it, Alexis.

07:09.637 --> 07:12.974
No, I said watch her
and make sure that she keeps quiet.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.562
Okay. You're gonna have to stay in hiding
until this blows over.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.149
They cannot find out
that we were working together.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.985
They could.
I could tell the police everything.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.654
How we met. What our plan was.

07:27.196 --> 07:29.699
I can take a DNA test
to prove I'm not your son

07:29.782 --> 07:31.617
<i>and that you switched the first one.</i>

07:31.701 --> 07:35.204
-My money. Five billion dollars.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.875
-Okay, fine. A million.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.002
I don't have anything.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.838
You burnt down my home
with everything in it.

07:43.921 --> 07:47.675
You get my money or I'm going to the cops.
You have 38 hours.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.929
-You mean 48.
-I mean two days. Starting now.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.228
You don't think Liam misled him?
-He seemed as flustered as I was.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.440
And his uncle is such a bulldozer,
I get how it happened.

08:02.523 --> 08:05.776
Liam told him how we used to be married,
he latched on to that,

08:05.860 --> 08:10.448
and now if we correct him, we might
blow the deal. We're so close to signing.

08:10.531 --> 08:13.075
How long do you have to pretend
to be married... again?

08:13.659 --> 08:16.662
Through the weekend, I guess.
At least until the ink is dry.

08:16.954 --> 08:19.665
If that's all it takes to be free
of the company, isn't it worth it?

08:20.291 --> 08:22.627
-I'm gonna tell him.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.755
I can't keep him in the dark
about something so important.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.049
I'm not a monster.

08:30.426 --> 08:34.138
Oh, children,
it feels so great to be home.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.266
Oh, oops. I've got it. Don't worry.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.479
Do you need a wheelchair after a facelift?

08:41.562 --> 08:43.814
I'm assuming that's why
you were in the hospital so long.

08:43.898 --> 08:47.902
No, Fallon. They finally released me,
and I have no place to stay.

08:47.985 --> 08:51.948
And considering my home burnt down
and the suspect is still at large,

08:52.698 --> 08:55.159
surely you wouldn't kick your mother
to the curb.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.619
You're right.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.914
Dad's on his way from the airport.
He'll do it.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.959
I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad we're all here.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.008
Oh, who's been redecorating?

09:12.468 --> 09:13.594
That's Cristal.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.805
Well, it's not Waterford.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.350
You mean the person?

09:21.435 --> 09:24.272
Well, what in the hell is she doing
in the foyer?

09:24.355 --> 09:26.482
Hey. I saw your interview.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.033
-Nothing, Mom. Sam, calm down.
-No. Don't tell me to calm down.

09:36.117 --> 09:39.954
-I meant what I said about Mother Teresa.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.789
They're fighting because of you.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.791
You never take my side.

09:43.874 --> 09:47.086
-I'm on your side. Let's deescalate--
-Quiet! Gentlemen, please.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.838
Don't talk to your mother like that.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.471
Dad?

10:02.059 --> 10:03.644
Blake, wait.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.609
-No.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.032
-Oops.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.505
If you want, I can call it off.
Why?

10:31.589 --> 10:33.841
I already survived your fake husband once.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.385
-I really don't deserve you.
-I know.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.305
Look, it's just one weekend, all right?

10:39.388 --> 10:42.933
One party? I'd rather suffer through that
than another year of you working at CA.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.811
So, close the deal,
and we move on with our lives.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.481
But even if we're onboard
with this mock marriage,

10:48.564 --> 10:50.608
there's my dad
and his Joaquin Phoenix beard.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.194
I'm not sure
whether to be worried about him or worried he's back to sabotage the deal.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.947
I wouldn't put anything past him.

10:58.574 --> 11:01.577
But you?
You need to follow your instincts.

11:05.915 --> 11:06.916
Trust yourself.

11:19.553 --> 11:22.014
Hey, can you get us some ice?

11:29.438 --> 11:30.689
Who is it, Jasper?

11:32.858 --> 11:35.528
Oh, Daddy. Come to join us?

11:36.404 --> 11:38.364
A little late for a party, Kirby.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.866
Mm. Considering it started last night.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.662
Everybody out!

11:56.173 --> 11:58.843
Those pills would be the reason
the manager called me.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.681
I swear they're not mine.
A friend got them from Housekeeping.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.100
You should be having a word
with the management

12:06.183 --> 12:09.103
-about their drug-addicted staff.
-That's enough, Kirby.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.939
Housekeeping actually is
kind of crap, though.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.692
-You should complain.
-This is hardly laying low.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.654
There are only so many hotels
in this city.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.742
There's always the Manor.
You can't hide me forever, Daddy.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.702
No.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.371
Just until they arrest a suspect.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.999
Remember, the last time
the Carringtons saw you

12:30.082 --> 12:32.084
you were trying to light their house
on fire.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.670
How many times have I told you?
Fallon framed me.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.213
That bitch ruined my life.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.468
You know what? Not the point.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.847
I came here to move on
because I thought that's what you wanted.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.934
But the longer I'm here,
the more it seems like

12:49.018 --> 12:52.521
you're not protecting me from them.
You're protecting them from me.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.609
Blake is prepping
for an event this weekend.

12:56.692 --> 13:00.571
As soon as the time is right, I will speak
to him about you moving to the Manor.

13:11.540 --> 13:14.126
Welcome back.
Did you not go to bed last night?

13:14.585 --> 13:15.753
I was up working.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.672
That's what happens
when you turn your back on reality.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.301
What Fallon means to say
is that we missed you.

13:22.927 --> 13:27.515
I, for one, think a little liquor
is necessary at times like these.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.807
You mean morning?

13:28.891 --> 13:31.393
Blake, I'm not gonna beat around the bush.

13:31.769 --> 13:36.148
I have nowhere to go. No money.
I mean, surely the stables are insured.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.943
And technically,
if the deed is in my name,

13:39.568 --> 13:42.905
perhaps you'd consider
giving me the insurance money,

13:42.988 --> 13:44.823
to compensate for my loss.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.535
Your loss

13:49.745 --> 13:52.831
That seems fair,
considering it's your property.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.794
Oh. I thought this meeting
was just us, Dad.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.172
It's a family meeting.
What is it you wanted to tell me?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.758
It's just...
there's been a few complications.

14:03.634 --> 14:08.013
Like the lawsuits from the fire.
Wedding guests trying to take advantage.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.432
I'll take care of the lawsuits.
Anything else?

14:10.849 --> 14:13.269
No. I mean, pretty much.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.439
-I may have gotten someone pregnant.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.525
-Yes, a woman.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.277
Before I was committed to Sam.

14:22.528 --> 14:26.448
The point is, surely you
knocked someone up pre- or post-Mom.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.910
What's fair in this situation,
child support

14:30.995 --> 14:33.247
-No.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.458
With everything he's going through...
I'm working on it.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.919
This is our estate planner.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.214
Contact her about setting up a trust.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.218
If I were you, I would tell Sam first.

14:46.677 --> 14:50.014
Speaking of poor decisions,
what do you know about Max Van Kirk?

14:50.097 --> 14:53.809
I'm sure you're pissed about me selling,
but it's a foregone conclusion.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.853
What I need you to do is get onboard.

14:55.936 --> 14:59.273
Do a song and dance for Max at the party,
who, one slight hitch,

14:59.356 --> 15:00.900
still thinks I'm married to Liam.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.695
You did any research on this family
you're about to get into bed with?

15:04.778 --> 15:07.323
Whoever they are,
they couldn't be crazier than mine.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.409
Sir, there's a woman here to see you.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.454
-I don't know how to tell you this.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.498
It's Cristal Flores.

15:22.713 --> 15:26.675
-The license checks out.
-I told you. I'm the real Cristal Flores.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.928
Your late wife's real name
was Celia Machado.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.639
Please.
Clearly, she saw Mother's interview.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.807
The one where she outed Cristal
as a criminal.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.309
In my defense, I was on Ambien.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.646
My life has been nothing but misery
since my identity was stolen.

15:39.104 --> 15:43.734
How many years ago was that?
-I don't know. It's been so long.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.404
-Ten, maybe 12 years.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.990
I was in Florida, minding my business--

15:50.491 --> 15:52.326
My aunt didn't steal your identity.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.995
She got it from a woman in a hospital
in Mexico.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.457
But nice try.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.545
Maybe that's what she told you,
but I'm the victim here.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.715
Anders, cut her a check.

16:08.008 --> 16:11.762
-That's not a good precedent to set, sir.
-Give a gold digger a cookie...

16:11.845 --> 16:14.014
Five hundred thousand
so we can be done with this.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.350
-Oh, my God--
-Just take the check and go.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.352
Thank you so much.
You're doing the right thing.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.566
You wanna turn some rando
into a lottery winner, go ahead.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.403
Just stay inside.
Uncle Max will be here soon.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.239
I don't want you meeting
until you cut that cat off your face.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.576
Does my nephew often keep you waiting?

16:34.660 --> 16:38.205
-Oh, I'm sure he'll be here any minute.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.959
Uh... He's still a little jet-lagged
after his sabbatical.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.669
You'll meet him at the party.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.255
Best to let his charm sink in
over cocktails.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.466
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.136
This is Liam's uncle Max.

16:52.219 --> 16:55.723
Culhane is an old friend
who's just staying with us for a while.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.475
-Michael Culhane.
-A friend of hers is family to me.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.394
-Max.
Liam.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.188
-Culhane.
-Yup.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.191
Hi. You kidding

17:10.279 --> 17:13.032
I've seen you hug Aunt Moira
with more affection. Come on.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.491
You're newlyweds!

17:17.202 --> 17:21.623
Now you kiss her like she's your mother.
Can you give her a real kiss? Come on.

17:28.964 --> 17:29.965
That's more like it.

17:30.507 --> 17:33.844
You will have plenty of time
to cultivate a sex-starved marriage.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.888
Just ask my wife.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.183
Michael, will you be
at the celebrations tomorrow?

17:39.641 --> 17:41.143
I was, but...

17:43.979 --> 17:44.938
something came up.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.900
Ooh. It's hot.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.571
I'll be seeing you two lovebirds later.

17:57.659 --> 18:00.996
I'm so sorry, Michael.
I never should have kissed Liam like that.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.915
The last thing I want
is for this to hurt you.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.834
Whatever you need to do,
it's cool with me.

18:09.713 --> 18:15.344
That's right, Fallon. Like Michael said,
whatever you need, it's totally cool.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.483
What are you doing awake?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.736
Drowning my sorrows in chamomile.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.863
So, you haven't told Sam yet?

18:36.406 --> 18:38.158
I tried, sort of.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.077
He's not in a good place now,

18:40.160 --> 18:43.330
and I'm scared that more bad news
might totally break him.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.040
-Let's just say

18:45.124 --> 18:47.334
Culhane may be down
with the marriage charade,

18:47.417 --> 18:49.002
but my subconscious isn't.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.213
Like you said,
it's just till the ink's dry.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.007
-Actually, it's six months.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.761
Liam's creepy uncle Max wants me
to stay on as a transition consultant.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.139
But Culhane and I have talked
about going to New York,

19:00.222 --> 19:01.682
starting a real life together.

19:01.765 --> 19:05.018
I'm scared that if I'm stuck in this lie
for six months,

19:05.102 --> 19:07.813
then it might... confuse my true feelings.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.773
I'd suggest getting in bed
with someone else.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.110
Business bed.

19:13.193 --> 19:16.238
What about that Russian oligarch
that made the first offer?

19:17.114 --> 19:20.742
I know it means getting in touch
with someone you'd rather not, but...

19:21.326 --> 19:22.411
What else is family for?

19:46.935 --> 19:48.020
Good morning, sir.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.566
We have a slight issue at the front gate.

19:53.317 --> 19:57.196
I warned you that handing out that check
to the Floridian Cristal Flores

19:57.279 --> 19:59.114
was setting a dangerous precedent.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.576
They're claiming to be Cristal
or relatives thereof.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.579
They, too, would like to be compensated
for their trouble.

20:06.371 --> 20:10.667
We're in mourning. My aunt got murdered,
and you show up looking for handouts,

20:10.751 --> 20:12.461
you heartless, greedy liars?

20:12.544 --> 20:14.713
Your aunt used a fake identity
to get ahead.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.006
She was the real gold digger.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.842
-Hey, hey. Come on. That's enough.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.094
Pay them what they want.
Get them out of here.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.680
If Mrs. Carrington was a fraud,
what does that make her nephew?

20:23.764 --> 20:26.600
Another illegal scamming
hardworking Americans for money?

20:27.392 --> 20:29.186
Are you serious? You're a pap.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.813
You're a literal leech,
you son of a bitch.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.149
It's what they do.
He's trying to get a reaction.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.234
Wake up, Carrington.

20:35.317 --> 20:38.528
You got played by your wife,
and your son's being played by this idiot.

20:46.078 --> 20:50.666
You didn't need to jump in and defend me.
It just kills me, you know?

20:50.749 --> 20:54.378
Seeing all those women trying
to score a payday off Cristal's death.

20:54.878 --> 20:59.091
Cristal deserved better than that.
She certainly deserved better than me.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.845
Things might not have been great
at the end, but I know you loved her.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.474
And she loved you.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.851
At one point she did.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.564
Guess I'll go get ready for the party.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.819
-Yeah, it's just bruised.

21:18.902 --> 21:19.861
No, I mean you.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.158
-My own kids didn't even ask me that.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.954
I guess it goes with being a father.

21:29.871 --> 21:33.458
Kids don't appreciate their parents
until they become one themselves.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.127
Or until they lose one.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.889
<i>♪ Every time I see you falling ♪</i>

21:47.973 --> 21:50.434

21:50.517 --> 21:54.438

22:32.809 --> 22:36.813
-Wow. That was amazing.
-Just don't ask me to do the Charleston.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.149
Noted. What's your favorite drink?

22:39.232 --> 22:42.027
-In case my uncle inquires.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.321
You Carringtons know how to throw a party.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.740
If this is typical
with Carrington Atlantic,

22:46.823 --> 22:50.285
we might have to find you a permanent
position as party planner and performer.

22:51.536 --> 22:54.623
I was on the CEO track,
but it's nice to know I have a backup.

22:58.418 --> 23:02.798
Uh, Liam, why don't you show
your uncle Max where the bar is?

23:02.881 --> 23:03.840
Let's do it.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.426
Southside, extra mint?

23:12.015 --> 23:14.810
Ah. You must be Nikolai Dimitrov.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.229
A pleasure Ms. Carrington.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.981
I had no idea birds were big
in the Roaring '20s.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.652
And I found out on the ride over it talks.
A lot.

23:23.735 --> 23:26.905
I look forward
to discussing a potential deal.

23:26.988 --> 23:29.699
-Yes, I have a draft--
-After a cocktail, of course.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.617
Of course.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.410
Of course.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.373
Are you sure about this?

23:36.456 --> 23:39.459
The numbers Nikolai was throwing around
seemed less than the Van Kirk deal.

23:40.001 --> 23:43.630
Well, that offer is not without caveats.
It's practically quicksand.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.133
Monica and I just want the sale
to go through.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.988
Mrs. Daniels.
I didn't know you were here tonight.

24:08.738 --> 24:12.159
Well, I never miss a good party.
And I was filling Sam in on my news.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.666
-The woman's having a baby, Steven.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.418
He's not the most observant.

24:22.085 --> 24:24.379
-But he sure is handsome.
-Yes.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.465
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.428
I gotta go hit the dessert table.
Why can't I be eating for two?

24:31.511 --> 24:33.263
Aww.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.642
-Somebody should be.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.312
You're lucky he thinks I'm with Paul.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.690
I told you, Sam is in a bad place.

24:43.773 --> 24:47.402
Yes, and you forced me to lie to him.
Which I'm not gonna do again.

24:49.196 --> 24:52.741
Listen, Nik. Surely you know
we could get a higher offer elsewhere.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.493
If you could get a better deal,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

24:56.745 --> 25:00.540
-You're hungrier than my little Rocky.
-Hmm. I hope you mean your parrot.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.667
-Hmm.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.297
Obviously, it's not all about money.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.592
I wanna make sure
CA finds a home that's a good fit.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.178
-And Olikov Corp is just that.
-Only one condition.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.640
The CEO remains with the company for...

25:17.557 --> 25:18.433
one year.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.520
-I'd consider three months.
-I was referring to your father.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.408
I'd like to think anything is possible.

26:00.809 --> 26:02.644
What fresh hell is this?

26:02.727 --> 26:04.771
You have no business
being in Fallon's bedroom.

26:04.854 --> 26:05.855
I got lost.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.067
Did you talk to Blake about me staying?

26:10.193 --> 26:12.028
Mr. Carrington denied my request.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.741
You didn't even ask him, did you?

26:17.409 --> 26:20.745
Once again,
you choose this family over me.

26:21.621 --> 26:25.959
I'm doing this to protect you, Kirby.
With your history and the investigation--

26:26.042 --> 26:29.296
I had nothing to do with that fire,
back then or last month.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.090
You're the only one who suspects me.

26:32.173 --> 26:35.885
-My own father doesn't even trust me.
-You've never given me reason to.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.391
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

26:41.474 --> 26:42.809
The reason I sent you away

26:42.892 --> 26:46.813
was because I thought you would be
better off in Australia with your mother.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.734
I'm sorry. I still think that's the case.

27:02.787 --> 27:03.955
This is Alexis.

27:05.749 --> 27:06.875
Hello?

27:06.958 --> 27:11.338
<i>No, I said watch her</i>
<i>and make sure that she keeps quiet.</i>

27:11.421 --> 27:14.382
<i>They cannot find out</i>
<i>that we were working together.</i>

27:15.633 --> 27:18.553
<i>They cannot find out</i>
<i>that we were working together.</i>

27:20.388 --> 27:23.892
-Great party.
-You set me up to say those things.

27:24.517 --> 27:27.645
You have some nerve showing up here.
What if somebody sees you?

27:29.272 --> 27:31.191
-I don't have it.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.234
I'm not even close.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.906
I'll give you three more days.
Then I'm going to the cops.

27:39.032 --> 27:39.908
Understood?

27:40.742 --> 27:42.535
Mm.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.466
Welcome back to the land of the living.
Happy anniversary.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.677
I know how much
this company meant to you, Dad.

27:59.761 --> 28:02.222
I was thinking
about what a value you bring to CA.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.557
-Of course.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.227
Which is why I think
you should consider staying on.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.354
Is that Nikolai Dimitrov?

28:10.647 --> 28:13.691
Good, you know him.
That's what I wanted to talk about.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.694
Can I steal you?

28:21.950 --> 28:23.118
Everything okay?

28:24.077 --> 28:26.246
Who's the Russian dude
you were talking to?

28:26.329 --> 28:29.582
-No one important.
-The bird and the bling imply otherwise.

28:30.208 --> 28:34.295
Look, Liam, you should know that we are
fielding other offers for the company.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.338
What?

28:36.548 --> 28:38.216
Uncle Max is ready to sign.

28:38.299 --> 28:41.886
-Well, I'm sorry. It's just business.
-He's paying above market value.

28:42.595 --> 28:45.098
-Because of us.

28:45.765 --> 28:48.852
You're not my husband, Liam.
You're not even my boyfriend.

28:48.935 --> 28:52.021
Thank God,
because I have one who I'm in love with.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.316
Can I tell you what I think is going on?

28:58.611 --> 29:02.198
I saw the way you looked at me earlier
when you were singing.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.118
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-And that kiss.

29:06.536 --> 29:09.247
I felt it. And so did you.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.251
I think the only reason
you're looking for another offer

29:13.334 --> 29:15.795
is because you don't trust yourself
around me.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.131
You know you made the wrong decision.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.887
-Don't flatter yourself.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.390
I mean, the Fallon I know
is all about the deal.

29:28.683 --> 29:30.018
So, why back out now?

29:32.937 --> 29:33.772
Because...

29:35.732 --> 29:37.609
Because I need to go get some air.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.283
-Nikolai Dimitrov.
-Carrington.

29:45.366 --> 29:48.912
Still palling around with that peabrain?
I'm talking to the bird.

29:48.995 --> 29:52.373
Oh, you must miss him.
Do you still have the dog?

29:52.874 --> 29:54.667
Or did you lose that
in a poker game as well?

29:54.751 --> 29:56.461
Oh, I didn't lose Rocky.

29:56.544 --> 29:59.005
He was stolen from me by a cheat.

29:59.088 --> 30:01.424
Like how your wife cheated on you with me?

30:01.966 --> 30:03.051
Ex-wife.

30:03.134 --> 30:06.554
Why don't you take that disease-infested
pet and get out of my house?

30:06.638 --> 30:10.558
No, I can't leave. I've come to buy
your company out from underneath you.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.435
Oh, too late.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.814
-We're selling to the Van Kirks.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.358
Fallon changed her mind
and agreed to sell to me.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.527
And now, who told you that

30:20.902 --> 30:24.572
Don't worry. She made a good deal.
You stay with the company for one year.

30:25.824 --> 30:26.825
To be my bitch.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.618
My bitch.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.836
Blake, I need to talk to you.

30:37.919 --> 30:41.297
-It's about the insurance--
-Wait. Let me guess. You need money.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.925
-W--
-You should have a T-shirt made.

30:46.427 --> 30:49.055
Dad, did you know Mrs. Daniels is here?

30:54.602 --> 30:56.688
You got Senator Daniels' wife pregnant?

30:57.814 --> 31:00.275
They're divorcing, but... yeah.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.986
Did you at least tell Sam the truth
like I told you to?

31:03.611 --> 31:06.072
Look, I just need you
to get rid of her. Now.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.825
You are not the son I raised.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.377
Did you offer me up on a platter
to Nikolai Dimitrov?

31:20.253 --> 31:23.256
I am not letting my family's company fall
into the hands of that rat.

31:23.339 --> 31:26.301
Well, you have no say in the matter.
You were outvoted.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.468
You and I both know

31:27.552 --> 31:31.347
that Nikolai doesn't have the resources
to match the Van Kirks' offer.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.349
How'd you screw this up?

31:35.727 --> 31:39.731
You have no idea
what I have been through the last month.

31:40.356 --> 31:43.651
While you were off God-knows-where
in some childish fugue state,

31:43.735 --> 31:46.696
I had to be the adult here,
holding this family together.

31:46.779 --> 31:50.033
-I needed to figure things out.
-Well, I have figured things out.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.619
For the first time in my life,
I'm actually happy.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.164
And in love. With Culhane, by the way.

31:57.332 --> 32:00.752
And I want out of CA.
It has always been your company, not mine.

32:00.835 --> 32:03.463
If you care about me,
you will do this one thing for me.

32:03.546 --> 32:06.007
This one thing

32:07.467 --> 32:10.428
I've spent my life doing things for you,
not that you would notice.

32:10.511 --> 32:13.014
You've never done anything
that hasn't helped Blake Carrington!

32:13.097 --> 32:14.891
Don't you raise your voice to me.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.560
-I am still your father.
-Then act like one!

32:32.408 --> 32:33.451
Greetings, everyone.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.495
Can you believe it?

32:36.245 --> 32:37.830
One hundred years.

32:41.626 --> 32:42.502
Excuse me.

32:42.585 --> 32:45.880
You know, this company
has always been like family to me. Which is why it was so comforting
when so many of you reached out

32:49.717 --> 32:53.221
to see how I was doing
after the passing of my wife.

32:53.888 --> 32:54.889
Thank you.

32:55.515 --> 32:58.059
I also want to thank my son-in-law, Sam.

32:59.268 --> 33:02.689
He's a good person with a kind heart,

33:02.772 --> 33:05.400
and his aunt would be very proud of him.
Thank you.

33:08.903 --> 33:11.698
Sometimes I think
that he's too good for this family.

33:12.365 --> 33:15.743
After all,
not everyone would choose a husband

33:15.827 --> 33:17.745
with a baby on the way.

33:20.915 --> 33:24.544
Steven, maybe now you'll appreciate
all the things I've done for you

33:24.627 --> 33:26.379
as a father. Am I right, folks?

33:27.922 --> 33:30.883
I also want to thank
my lovely daughter, Fallon,

33:30.967 --> 33:33.678
for keeping the company running
while I was gone.

33:33.761 --> 33:37.974
You see, I was visiting all of the places
my late wife and I wanted to travel to,

33:38.057 --> 33:40.268
where I set up charitable foundations
in her name.

33:40.977 --> 33:41.978
While I was gone,

33:42.061 --> 33:45.231
Fallon finally realized,
after all these years,

33:45.314 --> 33:46.649
what's most important.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.818
-Yep, she is in love.
Aww.

33:48.901 --> 33:51.487
Well, Fallon, you reap what you sow.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.823
It couldn't make me happier

33:54.699 --> 33:58.953
to announce that we are selling CA
to her husband's family...

34:00.663 --> 34:01.581
the Van Kirks.

34:05.001 --> 34:07.462
Two family dynasties merging into one.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.634
But all good things must come to an end.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.221
That includes my time with the company.

34:17.638 --> 34:18.556
That's right.

34:19.182 --> 34:21.601
Twenty-three skiddoo.
I'm getting the hell out.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.646
Because the next chapter in my life
is gonna be about me.

34:26.856 --> 34:29.734
-Blake time. Let me tell you something.

34:30.318 --> 34:34.363
I intend to spend every dime I have

34:34.447 --> 34:37.116
before they put me in the ground,
'cause you can't take it with you.

34:37.492 --> 34:41.245
And God knows,
my spoiled children don't need any more.

34:43.706 --> 34:46.167
So, happy anniversary, everyone.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.377
Bite me.

34:51.005 --> 34:53.049
Well... congratulations?

35:09.023 --> 35:13.444
The silence is killing me here.
Can you at least yell at me or something?

35:15.071 --> 35:18.157
It's not that I'm not pissed. I am.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.620
But I can't help but feel like maybe...

35:24.330 --> 35:26.124
this baby is exactly what I need.

35:28.000 --> 35:32.213
-To pull me out of this dark place.

35:32.672 --> 35:35.216
My aunt said the woman
that gave her her identity,

35:35.299 --> 35:40.596
the real Cristal she met at the hospital,
told her that new life blooms from death.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.932
It just feels like a sign.

35:43.015 --> 35:46.853
Maybe this baby needs us
to be his parents.

35:48.354 --> 35:49.522
To help raise him.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.067
Like I needed Cristal to help raise me.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.029
I wanna do this.

35:59.699 --> 36:00.575
With you.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.077
You're unbelievable, Sam.

36:11.669 --> 36:12.670
I'm gonna call Melissa.

36:19.927 --> 36:21.637
I'll tell you what's unbelievable.

36:22.722 --> 36:25.766
The fact that a premenopausal woman
got knocked up

36:25.850 --> 36:27.518
by a gay man she slept with once.

36:28.644 --> 36:29.604
What do you want?

36:31.606 --> 36:34.233
Max found out
I was entertaining another offer.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.235
Now he needs more time to assess.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.779
He wants me to meet
with the other shareholders.

36:38.863 --> 36:42.074
So, I'm stuck in this nightmare with Liam
for even longer now,

36:42.158 --> 36:44.785
which I know you hate,
whether or not you admit it.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.662
-I don't wanna lose you.
-Hey, hey.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.080
-Hey, hey, hey.

36:48.831 --> 36:51.876
Relax. Everything's gonna be okay.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.046
All right? I promise.

37:01.844 --> 37:02.845
What's going on?

37:10.519 --> 37:11.562
Oh, my God.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.190
Fallon Carrington...

37:15.691 --> 37:17.318
you're not gonna lose me.

37:18.569 --> 37:21.155
Because I'm never letting go
of you ever again.

How can you afford that ring?
Not that it matters.

37:45.012 --> 37:48.057
Actually, your father gave it to me.
Before he disappeared,

37:48.140 --> 37:51.769
I asked him for your hand.
I didn't ask him as much as I told him.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.688
I was gonna propose

38:51.996 --> 38:53.706
I need money. To live.

38:54.081 --> 38:57.209
So, being the thirsty whore that you are,
you thought you'd take what you want.

38:57.293 --> 38:58.794

38:58.878 --> 39:01.339

-That--
-You have no respect for her.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.137
She's dead, Blake.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.433
And I'm not. But I'm still here.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.269
Do you know how it feels...

39:16.187 --> 39:19.732
to know you wish I was the one
that died in that fire instead of her?

39:19.815 --> 39:21.984
That is not true.
You're the mother of my children.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.363
Even if the only thing you loved
was money.

39:25.446 --> 39:28.866
That is the only way
that you knew how to show your love.

39:28.949 --> 39:32.620
It's how you cared for us.
You'd throw money at all your problems.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.539
You know what? You're right.

39:36.582 --> 39:38.042
