00:00.879 --> 00:02.437
<i>Previously on The Shield...</i>

00:02.639 --> 00:05.915
My detective found 12 bodies hacked
to pieces. Well, 11 bodies, one arm.

00:06.119 --> 00:08.154
Machete's weapon of choice
for the Salvadorans.

00:08.359 --> 00:10.589
Supports the tip
that Aceveda's cronies gave us...

00:10.799 --> 00:12.551
...that the killers were Salvadorans.

00:12.759 --> 00:14.272
Victims were all Mexican illegals.

00:14.479 --> 00:15.707
- ID's?
- All but the arm.

00:15.919 --> 00:19.195
My guy at INS ID'd the arm from the
San Marcos house. Eduardo Romero.

00:19.399 --> 00:21.310
Mid-level bureaucrat
in the Mexican government.

00:21.519 --> 00:23.953
It could embarrass people
on both sides of the border.

00:24.159 --> 00:27.117
You solve this, that's a dozen
murders in the win column.

00:27.319 --> 00:29.275
It might be enough
to keep these doors open.

00:29.479 --> 00:30.832
You know a guy named Hernan?

00:31.039 --> 00:33.997
He's a fed undercover
in the Salvadoran organization.

00:34.199 --> 00:35.518
Benjamin Westcott Gilroy?

00:35.719 --> 00:38.472
The Mexican authorities
sent him back.

00:38.679 --> 00:39.998
- Any family?
- Wife.

00:40.199 --> 00:41.234
I killed Lem.

00:41.439 --> 00:46.035
Please forgive me, please, I can't...
I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry.

00:46.239 --> 00:47.672
You dropped a grenade in his lap?

00:47.879 --> 00:50.234
- What did you do? Did you run?
- Shane?

00:50.879 --> 00:52.949
I did what I thought
had to be done at the time.

00:53.399 --> 00:54.627
He wouldn't go to Mexico.

00:54.839 --> 00:56.716
I told him about the
money we'd send him.

00:56.919 --> 00:59.433
- He never turned on us.
- Couldn't afford to take the chance.

00:59.639 --> 01:03.268
I mean, all I was doing
was following your game plan, coach.

01:03.479 --> 01:08.269
Get in your truck, drive away.
Leave here before I kill you.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.239 --> 02:18.434
I called you all last night.
Did you talk to Shane?

02:18.639 --> 02:21.472
- What happened?
- He did it.

02:22.119 --> 02:23.837
He killed Lem.

02:26.679 --> 02:28.795
Oh, Jesus Christ.

02:30.599 --> 02:32.715
- He confessed?
- He pocketed a grenade...

02:32.919 --> 02:35.513
...before Aceveda even told us
about Lem's deal.

02:35.719 --> 02:39.837
He looked him right in the eye,
dropped it in his lap and ran.

02:40.039 --> 02:41.916
Never included us,
never talked to us.

02:42.119 --> 02:43.996
Just took it on himself
and killed a guy...

02:44.199 --> 02:46.429
...who was only looking out for us.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.911
- Where is he now?
- Oh, no.

02:52.119 --> 02:56.510
It's over. He's never coming back.
He's moved on.

03:01.279 --> 03:02.712
Are we here for Hernan?

03:02.919 --> 03:05.592
He called a meet.
Said it was important.

03:13.639 --> 03:15.994
Reaching out to me
is a big risk to your cover.

03:16.199 --> 03:18.394
I know. I went to upload Zinman
on the spare arm...

03:18.599 --> 03:20.157
...that you guys found
in San Marcos.

03:20.359 --> 03:23.954
And I was met by some new guy,
Talbert.

03:24.159 --> 03:26.195
They gave you
a new handler midstream?

03:26.399 --> 03:28.959
Yeah. This guy knew
the arm belonged to Romero.

03:29.159 --> 03:31.195
Told me to leave it alone.
End of conversation.

03:31.399 --> 03:32.878
A Mexican official loses a limb...

03:33.079 --> 03:35.593
...on a hacked-up pile
of dead Mexi illegals...

03:35.799 --> 03:38.552
...and the U.S. and Mexican
governments both turn a blind eye?

03:38.759 --> 03:40.317
I've seen this shit go down before.

03:40.519 --> 03:43.670
Some fed up the food chain is getting
greased to keep it off the books.

03:43.879 --> 03:46.473
Brings in his own overseer,
keeps everyone else in the dark.

03:46.679 --> 03:48.590
You don't trust
who you're tethered to then.

03:48.799 --> 03:49.788
You're lost undercover.

03:49.999 --> 03:52.274
Until I know more,
I need a lifeline.

04:00.599 --> 04:01.668
Throwaway cell phone.

04:01.879 --> 04:03.358
Number can't be traced
to anybody.

04:03.559 --> 04:04.753
You need me, you call me.

04:04.959 --> 04:07.996
Salvadorans are promoting.
I could use a push to captain.

04:08.199 --> 04:10.997
I get my own crew, open me up
to a whole lot of gang secrets.

04:11.199 --> 04:12.791
How big a push do you need?

04:12.999 --> 04:15.832
Bosses are meeting
at Lonya's Bar on 9th.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.190
Need a raid at 2:00 sharp.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.832
What am I gonna find?

04:20.039 --> 04:22.428
Nothing. I'm gonna tip them off
before you show.

04:22.639 --> 04:24.470
Tell them I got a mole in the P.D.

04:25.319 --> 04:27.310
We'll come a-knocking.

04:32.479 --> 04:33.798
- What's up?
- A street fair...

04:33.999 --> 04:35.591
...with confetti and dead bodies.

04:35.799 --> 04:38.233
Got six shot up at the
El Salvador del Mundo festival.

04:38.439 --> 04:40.634
Four dead, multiple injuries,
women and children.

04:40.839 --> 04:43.911
I was waiting to see the Mexican
payback for the San Marcos murders.

04:44.119 --> 04:46.713
- City tacticals?
- No, we're on our own.

04:47.159 --> 04:49.115
Shane called in sick today.
He okay?

04:49.319 --> 04:51.196
Seemed fine last night.

04:58.279 --> 04:59.871
Unis are outnumbered.
Help them out.

05:00.079 --> 05:02.070
Spoke to three witnesses,
all the same story.

05:02.279 --> 05:04.156
Six Mexican bangers
wearing backpacks.

05:04.359 --> 05:06.554
- All wearing Byz Lat ink.
- Nobody pays attention...

05:06.759 --> 05:09.273
...until they pull out shotguns,
shooting everybody.

05:09.479 --> 05:10.958
Salvadorans sponsored this fair.

05:11.159 --> 05:13.753
This looks like retaliation
for San Marcos house murders.

05:13.959 --> 05:16.792
Hernan said the El Salvadorans
had nothing to do with San Marcos.

05:16.999 --> 05:20.309
- It was an internal Mexican beef.
- He's wrong. This smells like payback.

05:20.519 --> 05:23.397
- Bad intel on his part?
- He lied.

05:23.599 --> 05:25.874
Hey, hey, step back.
Hey, hey, ma'am.

05:27.399 --> 05:29.196
My son. My son is shot.

05:29.759 --> 05:31.909
Let me see him. No!

05:32.119 --> 05:35.031
Look, I'm sorry, you're gonna have
to stay behind the line, okay?

05:38.719 --> 05:42.029
We need to talk to Hernan. Find out
why he lied to us about San Marcos.

05:42.239 --> 05:44.628
Salvadorans are close
to giving him his captain stripes.

05:44.839 --> 05:46.989
He must not want local law
turning up the heat.

05:47.199 --> 05:48.712
Stepping on his upward mobility.

05:48.919 --> 05:51.035
- Plus, he's nervous.
- About what?

05:52.959 --> 05:55.348
Got a buddy at INS who ID'd
the chopped-off arm...

05:55.559 --> 05:56.787
...at the San Marcos house.

05:56.999 --> 06:00.196
It belongs to Eduardo Romero.
He's a mid-level Mexican bureaucrat.

06:00.399 --> 06:03.311
Hernan contacted me this morning.
He's nervous because ICE...

06:03.559 --> 06:05.868
...is telling him to back away
from the Romero trail.

06:06.079 --> 06:08.957
Sounds like somebody in lmmigration
doesn't wanna get burned.

06:09.159 --> 06:12.754
Hernan reached out to me because
he doesn't trust his chain of command.

06:12.959 --> 06:15.553
Doesn't mean we have to back off.
Run with that Romero lead.

06:15.759 --> 06:17.875
It might be our break
in the San Marcos case.

06:18.079 --> 06:19.831
Find the Byz Lats
who shot the festival.

06:20.039 --> 06:22.872
Hernan wants us to raid
a Salvadoran bar this afternoon.

06:23.079 --> 06:24.637
He's gonna give an early heads up.

06:24.839 --> 06:26.795
Earn points by keeping them
out of harm's way.

06:26.999 --> 06:28.955
Salvadoran bosses
are planning retaliation.

06:29.159 --> 06:30.478
We need to bring them in now.

06:30.679 --> 06:32.317
Going in early
could set Hernan back.

06:32.519 --> 06:33.793
He set us back by lying...

06:33.999 --> 06:36.388
...about San Marcos
being Mexican-on-Mexican.

06:38.119 --> 06:41.714
- He can gain favour some other way.
- Captain Wyms.

06:43.119 --> 06:45.110
I know the street festival thing
looks bad.

06:45.679 --> 06:47.909
I got the Strike Team
and my best detectives on it.

06:48.119 --> 06:50.394
San Marcos is still unsolved,
now this.

06:50.599 --> 06:53.159
Wilshire and Central
agreed to lend a hand.

06:53.359 --> 06:55.031
I don't recall asking them for help.

06:55.239 --> 06:58.356
Send copies of everything on the
street fair shooting and San Marcos...

06:58.559 --> 07:01.198
...so Wilshire and Central
can back you up.

07:03.519 --> 07:06.158
- Shane here?
- No, I haven't seen him.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.838
He didn't come home last night.

07:08.039 --> 07:10.712
- Everything all right between you two?
- Where the hell is he?

07:10.919 --> 07:12.068
I'll be right out.

07:16.199 --> 07:19.236
I don't know where Shane is.
Ask the captain, she might help you.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.875
He doesn't do anything without
you knowing. Don't dick me around.

07:23.079 --> 07:25.877
I'm not. That's his job.

07:26.639 --> 07:28.869
I know what happened last night.

07:30.919 --> 07:34.070
It was a busy evening.
You'll have to be more specific.

07:36.239 --> 07:37.797
About Lem.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.511
What about Lem?

07:44.439 --> 07:47.829
- lf you did anything to hurt Shane...
- Why would I hurt Shane?

07:48.039 --> 07:51.509
- What is it you think you know?
- I know everything about Shane.

07:51.719 --> 07:53.118
We don't have any secrets.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.396
Open and honest.

07:59.039 --> 08:01.269
That's always the best way, right?

08:30.439 --> 08:32.634
Goddamn it.
Bosses got out of here in a hurry.

08:32.839 --> 08:36.070
Waitress said they all took off
when they heard about the shooting.

08:36.279 --> 08:38.474
Hernan knew we'd come early
for the bosses.

08:38.679 --> 08:40.794
He just pulled them out early
to gain trust.

08:40.999 --> 08:44.753
- I think this guy's kind of an asshole.
- Let's flip it.

09:18.999 --> 09:19.954
Yeah?

09:20.159 --> 09:22.275
Hey, sorry
I missed your llamada, amigo.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.391
- Still need them smokes.
- You with the bosses?

09:25.599 --> 09:27.317
There a retaliation plan?

09:30.759 --> 09:31.714
Not the regs.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.989
That shit burns like garbage.

09:35.239 --> 09:37.707
- Garbage?
- Mak e sure you got them in stock.

09:51.519 --> 09:54.750
Found your cigars.
These the addresses for the bosses?

09:54.959 --> 09:57.996
Bueno, put two aside for me.
Don't forget me.

09:58.199 --> 10:00.155
Pick you up with the rest of them?

10:04.799 --> 10:07.916
Take back the asshole comment
about Hernan. He came through.

10:08.119 --> 10:10.235
Wants us to scoop him
with the rest of the bosses.

10:10.439 --> 10:12.794
Preserves his cover,
gets shot-callers off the street.

10:12.999 --> 10:15.832
- Buys us time to make a peace.
- But the shooters were Byz Lats.

10:16.039 --> 10:19.873
Just picking up the Salvadorans might
raise suspicion we've got a guy inside.

10:20.079 --> 10:23.913
Gang sweep. Wide net.
Salvadorans and Mexicans.

10:24.119 --> 10:26.917
Hernan's just another sad brown face
in the paddy wagon...

10:27.119 --> 10:28.950
...until we can get him alone.

10:31.879 --> 10:33.232
How can I help with the fallout?

10:33.439 --> 10:36.397
Phillips had me send over
our case files to Wilshire and Central.

10:38.159 --> 10:41.037
- He's gonna shut this place down.
- I would have heard something.

10:41.239 --> 10:44.356
He's bringing them up to speed,
so when they split the Farm in half...

10:44.559 --> 10:47.073
...the transition goes smoothly.

10:47.279 --> 10:50.271
They're keeping it under the radar
to protect morale.

10:50.479 --> 10:53.596
It's hard to motivate cops when
your home base is a sinking ship.

10:53.799 --> 10:56.154
I'll look into it on a policy level.

10:56.359 --> 10:57.872
How can I help right now?

10:58.079 --> 11:00.274
Those extra bodies
you threatened to spoil us with?

11:00.479 --> 11:01.912
- I need them.
- For what?

11:02.119 --> 11:05.555
Gang sweep. Gonna bring in as many
Byz Lats, Salvadorans as we can.

11:05.759 --> 11:08.068
Gives us time to find the shooters,
negotiate a peace.

11:08.279 --> 11:11.032
Mexican and Salvadoran communities
both feel victimized.

11:11.239 --> 11:13.195
- It sounds punitive.
- It's a warrant sweep.

11:13.399 --> 11:15.549
It's bringing felons in
from the front lines.

11:15.759 --> 11:16.908
It'll feel like a siege.

11:20.519 --> 11:23.716
ICE has an undercover operative
high up the Salvadoran food chain...

11:23.919 --> 11:25.637
...I need to protect.

11:25.839 --> 11:28.592
I gotta pick him up
without anyone getting wise.

11:28.799 --> 11:30.312
He can help us end this.

11:32.479 --> 11:34.390
Four-screen movie theatre.

11:34.599 --> 11:36.317
Restaurants, shopping.

11:36.519 --> 11:40.148
Walking distance from our low-income
housing and medical centre.

11:40.359 --> 11:42.190
Sounds like a community.

11:42.399 --> 11:44.469
These people work hard
for their money.

11:44.679 --> 11:48.115
Shouldn't have to bus
to Beverly Hills to spend it.

11:49.199 --> 11:51.554
Did you hear about
the street fair shooting?

11:51.759 --> 11:53.590
Oh, yes. It's awful.

11:53.799 --> 11:57.917
Looks like Byz Lat retaliation
for the San Marcos house murders.

11:58.439 --> 12:00.953
Why am I not surprised?

12:01.159 --> 12:03.593
Captain Wyms
is planning a gang sweep.

12:03.799 --> 12:06.154
Everyone with
an outstanding warrant.

12:08.959 --> 12:10.995
A blitzkrieg against Latinos.

12:11.199 --> 12:12.951
A pre-emptive safety measure.

12:13.159 --> 12:16.231
Getting gang members off the street,
keep the community safe.

12:16.439 --> 12:17.713
Between my media contacts...

12:17.919 --> 12:20.149
...and your community
and commercial clout...

12:20.359 --> 12:22.634
...we convince the press,
the neighbourhood...

12:22.839 --> 12:24.716
...that we're here to help.

12:24.919 --> 12:27.149
These people,
they don't see us Latinos.

12:27.359 --> 12:30.556
They see a developer
and a former cop.

12:30.759 --> 12:32.033
The Barn's at risk.

12:32.239 --> 12:34.707
If Captain Wyms doesn't reduce
crime stats, it goes away.

12:34.919 --> 12:36.557
Which means
less cops in our district.

12:36.759 --> 12:38.954
So, what good is all this
if we can't protect it...

12:39.159 --> 12:41.275
...or the people who come here?

12:41.839 --> 12:44.433
Salvadoreño women and children
were injured today.

12:44.639 --> 12:49.110
A sweep of their community.
It's not protection, it's an assault.

12:52.559 --> 12:54.550
There's an operative
inside the Salvadorans...

12:54.759 --> 12:57.478
...who can help solve
the street fair shooting.

12:57.679 --> 12:59.829
We need to pick him up
without casting suspicion.

13:00.039 --> 13:02.348
The gang sweep protects his cover.

13:02.559 --> 13:04.868
I can't spin this alone, man.

13:05.839 --> 13:07.875
Can you help me sell this?

13:13.319 --> 13:14.877
Tell me what to do.

13:17.599 --> 13:19.669
Hey, buddy.

13:19.879 --> 13:23.713
Miss me? You miss me?

13:23.919 --> 13:28.197
What do you think?
Where the hell have you been?

13:28.399 --> 13:30.071
I've just been driving. Thinking.

13:30.279 --> 13:32.076
Maybe you were getting
your dick sucked...

13:32.279 --> 13:34.076
...by your underaged Nubian whore?

13:34.279 --> 13:35.314
Hey, watch your mouth.

13:35.519 --> 13:40.035
- It's not my mouth I'm worried about.
- Don't throw that shit in my face.

13:40.239 --> 13:43.072
I left you a message,
said not to wait up.

13:43.279 --> 13:46.954
Yeah, that was 24 hours ago.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.956
- And I'm still up.
- Mara, my cell died.

13:49.159 --> 13:51.992
- I couldn't get to a phone...
- I didn't know what happened to you.

13:52.199 --> 13:56.829
I'm sorry. I'm okay.
I was just figuring some shit out.

13:57.039 --> 14:01.271
- Okay, I promise, I promise.
- I was so freaked out.

14:01.479 --> 14:03.197
I went to Vic...

14:03.399 --> 14:05.469
...but I didn't believe him
when he told me...

14:05.679 --> 14:06.873
You talked to Vic?

14:07.079 --> 14:10.549
When you didn't come home
I went to the Barn looking for you.

14:10.759 --> 14:14.229
- Well, what did you say to him?
- I just asked him where you were?

14:15.719 --> 14:18.074
He scared the shit out of me.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.753
Why would he scare you, Mara?

14:21.959 --> 14:23.950
Mara, what did you say to him?

14:24.159 --> 14:26.957
- I don't know. I just...
- Did you say anything about Lem?

14:27.159 --> 14:28.387
Did you?

14:32.679 --> 14:35.239
I think he might have figured it out.

14:35.719 --> 14:37.311
Goddamn it.

14:38.599 --> 14:42.478
What else, Mara?
What else did you say to him?

14:42.679 --> 14:45.034
I told him we didn't have
any secrets.

14:47.999 --> 14:50.718
You know who this guy is?
What he's done?

14:50.919 --> 14:53.717
The shit he can do, Mara?
Not just to me, but to you and Jacks?

14:54.919 --> 14:56.238
What's he done?

14:57.679 --> 15:01.467
The two of you,
what else have you done, Shane?

15:03.079 --> 15:05.115
- What?
- Enough.

15:08.799 --> 15:12.269
Is he gonna tell them about Lem?
Will they send you to prison?

15:12.479 --> 15:14.913
- He's not gonna say anything...
- You can't go to jail.

15:15.119 --> 15:18.907
He's not gonna say anything.
Because I know everything he's done.

15:20.799 --> 15:23.677
So you're a threat to him. Oh, God.

15:23.879 --> 15:26.347
We gotta get out of here.
We gotta get out of L.A.

15:26.559 --> 15:30.677
I know. I put a call in this morning
to Vice to try and get my spot back.

15:30.879 --> 15:32.107
I'll work for a year or so.

15:32.319 --> 15:34.628
I'll squirrel away enough for us
to get out of here.

15:34.839 --> 15:38.593
I just gotta take
some precautions first.

15:38.799 --> 15:40.198
What do you mean?

15:40.399 --> 15:43.789
Listen to me. I don't want you
to say anything, okay? Just listen.

15:43.999 --> 15:46.229
I want you to pack a bag
for you and Jackson.

15:46.439 --> 15:48.794
Just light, but enough
to live on for a while.

15:48.999 --> 15:51.149
- What're you gonna...?
- Just listen to me.

15:51.359 --> 15:53.270
All right, this is just a backup plan.

15:53.479 --> 15:56.516
Just in case we gotta get out of here
in a hurry, okay?

16:00.839 --> 16:02.909
Oh, shit.

16:03.119 --> 16:05.917
l... I'm supposed
to see Corrine tomorrow.

16:06.119 --> 16:10.078
- She's gonna give me some baby stuff.
- You know what? That's good.

16:10.279 --> 16:12.713
That's good. Make a day out of it.

16:14.479 --> 16:15.832
Vic won't do anything to us...

16:16.039 --> 16:18.109
...when we're
with his wife and kid, right?

16:23.279 --> 16:24.234
Our two key targets.

16:24.439 --> 16:27.875
Octavio Menez, he's calling shots for
the Salvadorans while Guardo's MIA.

16:28.079 --> 16:29.910
SWAT, you're all about him, okay?

16:30.119 --> 16:33.316
My team's on Santi Galas,
who's next in line as Byz Lat CEO.

16:33.519 --> 16:36.556
Okay, the rest of you,
know your man and your location.

16:36.759 --> 16:38.636
We move to set positions
in 15 minutes.

16:38.839 --> 16:41.558
These scumbags live with family.
That means elderly and kids.

16:41.759 --> 16:43.511
So safety off, but easy on the trigger.

16:43.719 --> 16:45.437
- Let's go.
- Okay.

16:46.319 --> 16:47.672
Ronnie.

16:47.919 --> 16:50.717
You're bringing in Hernan. They know
Mackey, we need a new face.

16:50.919 --> 16:53.956
We surveilled his apartment. He lives
with two bangers. Hit them hard.

16:54.159 --> 16:55.592
Bedroom's on the southeast side.

16:55.799 --> 16:58.029
Agent Talbert, ICE.

16:58.239 --> 16:59.991
You can't run an op
involving my men...

17:00.199 --> 17:02.110
...without coordinating
through my office.

17:02.319 --> 17:05.231
This op is sensitive. We didn't
have time to run it by Washington.

17:05.439 --> 17:08.476
We've got a tight lid on this,
but we do need the contact password.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.237
- I'm not signing off.
- Then don't.

17:10.439 --> 17:11.917
We'll doing it without your help.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.268
I'm putting a stop to this.

17:13.479 --> 17:15.788
Fed suits swarming
a local warrant sweep?

17:15.999 --> 17:18.115
Might as well paint a bull's-eye
on Hernan's back.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.787
And we don't answer to your bosses.
Let's go.

17:21.598 --> 17:23.476
Shit. Hey.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.472
Password's honeycomb.

17:27.679 --> 17:30.239
He calls you off for any reason,
you let him go.

17:30.439 --> 17:31.474
All right.

17:41.239 --> 17:43.673
Take your positions.
Move on my signal.

17:44.999 --> 17:46.398
Let's go.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.517
Police, freeze!

18:00.679 --> 18:02.158
- Honeycomb.
- Let me see your hands.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.387
Goddamn it.

18:13.599 --> 18:15.829
Santi's out the back.

18:17.399 --> 18:20.197
- Police!
- Go, go, go.

18:26.399 --> 18:28.037
Don't move.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.077
Godspeed.

18:47.559 --> 18:50.756
- Can I help you?
- Shane Vendrell.

18:51.879 --> 18:55.269
- One of Vic's guys.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

18:56.359 --> 18:58.350
A minute, yeah.

19:01.719 --> 19:04.791
- What do you need?
- A few weeks ago you gave Vic...

19:04.999 --> 19:07.035
...some information
about your late husband.

19:08.039 --> 19:11.270
Regarding Ben's time in Mexico.
People he knew down there.

19:11.479 --> 19:14.118
Vic said he needed that stuff
to close out Ben's case.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.354
Right.

19:15.559 --> 19:18.198
Well, I'm actually working
a similar thing, and...

19:18.399 --> 19:21.835
And I'm gonna have to get those facts
from you as well, if you don't mind.

19:24.239 --> 19:25.957
What case are you working?
What is this?

19:26.159 --> 19:30.391
I can't discuss the details with you.
You have to turn over that information.

19:30.599 --> 19:33.750
I don't want to have to file
a failure-to-cooperate charge.

19:34.279 --> 19:36.315
I was married to a cop
for 20 years, asshole.

19:36.519 --> 19:38.237
Don't threaten me
with bullshit charges.

19:38.439 --> 19:41.431
- Get out of here.
- Daughters know about their father?

19:41.639 --> 19:43.470
- What?
- Know he ripped off the city?

19:43.679 --> 19:45.476
Disgraced the badge
for some Latina snatch?

19:45.679 --> 19:47.317
- Shut up.
- They know he choked on puke?

19:47.519 --> 19:50.033
Died a poor miserable drunk
in some Mexi shit-hole?

19:50.239 --> 19:54.118
Those autopsy photos are brutal.
You want your daughters to see them?

19:58.119 --> 20:00.155
I want those Mexican
money contacts by tonight.

20:00.359 --> 20:03.032
Or I show and tell your girls
the whole ugly truth.

20:03.239 --> 20:05.230
I'll show myself out.

20:12.519 --> 20:14.828
Look, man, we know why
you lied about San Marcos...

20:15.039 --> 20:18.827
...being an internal Mexican beef.
- What we don't know is the truth.

20:21.199 --> 20:22.871
Mexicans got
something big brewing.

20:23.079 --> 20:25.388
Byz Lats are working the cartel
outside Mexico City.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.159
Salvadorans want a piece of it.

20:28.359 --> 20:31.749
Chopping the bodies at San Marcos
was sending a message to share.

20:31.959 --> 20:33.631
Share what?

20:33.839 --> 20:35.557
Only the captains know that.

20:35.759 --> 20:38.796
That's why I needed that favour.
Gotta earn my stripes.

20:38.999 --> 20:41.957
And the missing limb of a
Mexican government official?

20:42.159 --> 20:43.797
I don't know how that got in the mix.

20:43.999 --> 20:46.957
We can't afford a retaliation
for the street fair shooting.

20:47.159 --> 20:50.868
You need to mediate a peace between
Salvadoran bosses and the Byz Lats.

20:51.079 --> 20:53.752
There's no peace
without the shooters paying the price.

20:53.959 --> 20:55.358
I don't make the rules.

20:55.559 --> 20:57.914
If we get the shooters,
dump them in Chino...

20:58.119 --> 21:00.952
...let the Salvadorans celebrate
with a little shiv-fest...

21:01.159 --> 21:03.878
...you think you could convince
the Salvadoran grand Pooh-Bah...

21:04.079 --> 21:06.229
...to let that satisfy his blood lust?

21:06.439 --> 21:10.068
Octavio's not gonna promote me
to captain if I'm talking like Gandhi.

21:10.279 --> 21:11.678
Talk like Trump.

21:11.879 --> 21:15.349
Tell him it's about settling the beef
so everyone can get back to business.

21:15.559 --> 21:16.548
I'll see what I can do.

21:16.759 --> 21:19.671
You know the Salvadorans swinging
the machetes at San Marcos?

21:19.879 --> 21:22.677
No, I don't. It'd be the death
of my cover if I started asking.

21:22.879 --> 21:24.835
The Salvadorans are closing ranks.

21:25.039 --> 21:27.792
It's getting too dangerous
for you to be out there.

21:28.599 --> 21:31.067
I just spent six months
in a Salvadoran lockup...

21:31.279 --> 21:32.951
...two years here with these animals.

21:33.159 --> 21:34.638
You're not pulling me out of this.

21:35.879 --> 21:39.428
If he can help settle this beef,
earn his stripes...

21:39.639 --> 21:41.357
...it could give us a front row seat...

21:41.559 --> 21:43.390
...to whatever the Mexi gangs
have brewing.

21:46.359 --> 21:47.758
Okay.

21:48.359 --> 21:50.111
Need a minute.

21:54.199 --> 21:57.908
Got a call from Vice.
Shane's put in for his old position.

21:58.599 --> 22:01.033
Makes sense. Lem gone.

22:01.239 --> 22:04.117
Me being forced out maybe.
It's the right move.

22:04.319 --> 22:05.911
So you didn't know about it?

22:06.119 --> 22:08.155
He also requested
two weeks unpaid leave.

22:08.359 --> 22:10.077
Same amount of time
you might have left.

22:10.279 --> 22:13.874
- This news bulletin have a point?
- His downtime is gonna be denied.

22:14.079 --> 22:16.718
It'll take two weeks to process
his request.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.637
Means you'll still
be working together.

22:18.839 --> 22:20.318
Fine. Then let me get back at it.

22:20.519 --> 22:21.747
Don't leave me hanging here.

22:21.959 --> 22:25.713
If something happened between you
that affects the job, I need to know.

22:25.919 --> 22:28.956
What's affects the job
is our friend getting blown to shit.

22:29.159 --> 22:31.878
You got a problem with Shane,
take it up with his team leader.

22:32.079 --> 22:34.309
I'm just a hired hand here now.

22:36.999 --> 22:40.036
Byz Lats and the Salvadorans
were playing nice together.

22:40.239 --> 22:42.309
Paid them to protect your drug run.

22:42.519 --> 22:44.316
Come on, Santi,
don't you Biz Lats know...

22:44.519 --> 22:46.271
...you gotta get along
with these psychos?

22:46.479 --> 22:48.629
Either that or get a grenade
shoved up your ass.

22:48.839 --> 22:52.309
- Ain't nothing up my ass except you.
- Yeah? How am I feeling?

22:52.519 --> 22:55.317
If these street fair shooters
were to go down...

22:55.519 --> 22:58.352
...it would make your life
a whole lot easier.

22:58.559 --> 23:00.675
Not to mention more profitable.

23:00.879 --> 23:04.155
Blood's gonna keep spilling
unless they feel vindicated.

23:04.359 --> 23:07.795
I mean, you better settle this soon or
you're gonna have nothing left to run.

23:19.279 --> 23:21.076
We know
who the Salvadorans were...

23:21.279 --> 23:24.191
...who hacked up
your illegal cousins at San Marcos.

23:24.399 --> 23:26.867
We were just waiting
for some red tape to clear...

23:27.079 --> 23:29.434
...then we're gonna pick them up
in a few days.

23:29.639 --> 23:32.631
Maybe these guys get lost
on the way back to the Barn.

23:33.559 --> 23:36.551
End up in a bad neighbourhood,
somehow?

23:37.879 --> 23:39.198
Tell me where to lose them.

23:41.599 --> 23:44.830
If I sacrifice my own guys
and give you the shooters.

23:45.039 --> 23:46.791
Blood for blood.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.796
The old-fashioned way.

23:48.999 --> 23:50.273
The score's even.

23:50.479 --> 23:54.233
The street calms down, everybody
gets back to commerce, right?

23:57.159 --> 23:58.990
Let me make a call...

24:01.959 --> 24:04.427
...that can't be traced.

24:06.279 --> 24:09.715
Throwaway phone.
Use all the minutes you need.

24:13.639 --> 24:15.516
Hey, so where exactly
are we gonna find...

24:15.719 --> 24:16.947
...these San Marcos killers?

24:17.159 --> 24:18.831
Somewhere, eventually.

24:22.279 --> 24:24.156
That Gilroy's widow?

24:24.359 --> 24:27.351
- Nance, everything all right?
- What the hell is your guy up to?

24:27.559 --> 24:30.631
- What guy?
- That goddamn hillbilly.

24:31.999 --> 24:33.557
That's interesting.

24:35.559 --> 24:37.675
- What's going on?
- He showed up at my house today.

24:37.879 --> 24:41.076
Wanted that information
I gave you weeks ago.

24:41.279 --> 24:42.917
- Ben's Mexican contacts?
- Yeah.

24:43.119 --> 24:44.916
Said he's working on
some hush-hush case.

24:45.119 --> 24:46.154
Nothing I know about.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.190
I gave you those contacts
on the Q.T.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.435
If they find out
I was funnelling money to him...

24:50.639 --> 24:51.708
No, they won't.

24:51.919 --> 24:53.875
I told IAD that I dug up that intel.

24:54.079 --> 24:56.149
So they'd put Ben's case to bed.

24:56.359 --> 24:58.554
Leave you and the girls alone.

24:59.239 --> 25:02.868
So if I put a call in to IAD,
they'll know what I'm talking about?

25:04.959 --> 25:07.996
Jesus Christ. It never ends, does it?

25:08.199 --> 25:09.188
I'll take care of Shane.

25:09.399 --> 25:13.312
He threatened to tell my girls
all the dirty details.

25:13.519 --> 25:15.714
The embezzlement, the affair.

25:15.919 --> 25:17.352
Gonna show them autopsy photos.

25:17.959 --> 25:20.553
I have done everything in my power
to keep them protected...

25:20.759 --> 25:22.397
...from the wreckage of that asshole.

25:22.599 --> 25:24.555
You rein him in, Vic,
or so help me God...

25:24.759 --> 25:26.078
I'll take care of it.

25:26.279 --> 25:27.837
I'm sorry.

25:28.679 --> 25:31.876
He's coming by tonight, late.

25:37.239 --> 25:38.558
What the hell was that about?

25:38.759 --> 25:42.115
Shane's getting ready
for a long, cold winter.

25:42.319 --> 25:44.833
He's looking for Gilroy's
Mexican contacts.

25:45.519 --> 25:49.273
- He thinks you're coming after him?
- Put in for a transfer to Vice too.

25:49.479 --> 25:51.071
He's covering all his bases.

25:52.039 --> 25:54.075
We gonna be one of the bases
he tries to cover?

26:00.359 --> 26:03.396
- I need to talk to the baker.
- Okay.

26:11.719 --> 26:13.038
I am Yezik. Can I help you?

26:13.239 --> 26:15.548
- What the hell is this shit?
- Barazek.

26:15.759 --> 26:19.195
No wonder you give it away for free.
Tastes like old tires.

26:19.919 --> 26:23.707
Heard you got some old school guy,
Kesakian, running your bakery now.

26:23.919 --> 26:27.389
- Need to chat with him.
- Don't know Kesakian.

26:28.919 --> 26:31.911
I see about a dozen health
code violations in this room alone.

26:32.119 --> 26:34.235
Gives me authority to
opening up all your ovens.

26:34.439 --> 26:36.907
You sure all I'm gonna find
is half-baked barazek?

26:37.119 --> 26:39.838
Maybe I can take a message
to someone.

26:40.039 --> 26:41.757
That'd be swell, Yezik.

26:41.959 --> 26:44.268
Tell Kesakian I've got
a business proposition for him.

26:44.479 --> 26:46.947
I'm a cop he's gonna need to know.

26:49.879 --> 26:54.236
Shane's... He's just so hard
to access sometimes.

26:56.199 --> 26:59.350
- Did Vic talk about the job much?
- Not really.

26:59.559 --> 27:02.790
I'd ask him about things.
Try to get him to open up.

27:02.999 --> 27:05.115
After a while, I stopped asking.

27:05.719 --> 27:07.550
Shane tells me some stuff.

27:07.759 --> 27:10.637
That's probably better.
It'll keep you close.

27:10.839 --> 27:14.388
I gotta be honest, sometimes
I wish he didn't tell me anything.

27:14.599 --> 27:17.557
- It kind of freaks me out.
- Well, the job sucks.

27:17.759 --> 27:20.796
Turned our marriage bad
and made him hard.

27:21.519 --> 27:23.430
He wasn't like that
when I first met him.

27:23.639 --> 27:26.028
He was pretty sweet actually.

27:27.399 --> 27:29.355
He's had a tough run.

27:29.559 --> 27:33.393
- The IAD charges and stuff with...
- Yeah, those were all bullshit.

27:33.599 --> 27:35.351
He had nothing to do
with Lem's murder.

27:35.559 --> 27:36.992
I know.

27:38.359 --> 27:42.318
- And I am glad it got worked out.
- Yeah. We all are.

27:42.519 --> 27:46.148
It's the off-duty shit
that scares me the most.

27:46.359 --> 27:48.270
You know?

27:48.479 --> 27:50.549
No, I don't.

27:51.559 --> 27:53.834
I'm gonna get you more juice.

27:57.639 --> 27:59.595
Eduardo Romero.

27:59.799 --> 28:02.757
Mexico's Assistant Secretary
of Trade and Export Eduardo Senior...

28:02.959 --> 28:04.312
...V ice Secretary of Finance.

28:04.519 --> 28:07.636
Hell's this guy's hacked-off arm
doing in Farmington.

28:07.839 --> 28:09.909
Where's the rest of the corpse?

28:10.959 --> 28:12.995
You... You sure you know
where you're going?

28:13.199 --> 28:17.033
I used to troll for UCLA hotties
when I was in community college.

28:17.239 --> 28:20.231
Wasn't gonna take them back
to Alhambra so I'd drive up here...

28:20.439 --> 28:21.997
...say I'm going to my folks' place.

28:22.199 --> 28:23.917
This worked?

28:25.799 --> 28:28.438
- You'd be surprised.
- How'd you pull it off?

28:29.479 --> 28:31.117
Never went in.

28:32.559 --> 28:36.313
Find a place with the lights on,
tell them my folks came home early.

28:36.519 --> 28:38.555
We'd have to go to her place.

28:38.759 --> 28:41.876
Amazing how quick the thighs open
when they think your folks got coin.

28:44.079 --> 28:47.310
Looks like Eduardo's ex found herself
a rich gringo.

28:51.759 --> 28:55.354
You know, Dutch, I could teach you
a few things about women if you want.

28:58.119 --> 29:01.350
Why don't you write them down
and I can read them at my leisure.

29:08.399 --> 29:11.197
- Kesakian?
- I'm an associate, Ellis Rezian.

29:11.399 --> 29:13.515
What is this, man?
I wanted to speak to Kesakian.

29:20.759 --> 29:24.115
I'm sorry. You want to talk business.
We're here in good faith.

29:25.319 --> 29:26.832
Kesakian's insulated.

29:27.039 --> 29:28.711
Rumours must be true.

29:28.919 --> 29:30.750
Old world muscle's moving back
in the hood.

29:30.959 --> 29:34.395
Just trying to teach our American-born
about loyalty and respect.

29:34.959 --> 29:35.994
Maybe I can help.

29:36.199 --> 29:38.190
Set a good example.

29:41.799 --> 29:44.233
Been a while since we had
a good relationship with law.

29:44.439 --> 29:46.794
Chopping people's feet
will strain any relationship.

29:46.999 --> 29:49.752
- We'd like to fix that.
- That's funny. I'm a fixer.

29:51.879 --> 29:53.517
There's a new gas station
on Talmadge.

29:53.719 --> 29:54.788
Iraqi-owned.

29:54.999 --> 29:57.832
Apparently they have
their own Arab-based petrol supplier.

29:58.039 --> 29:59.154
Sounds fishy.

29:59.359 --> 30:01.156
Could be funnelling money
back to al Qaeda.

30:01.359 --> 30:02.474
I better check it out.

30:02.679 --> 30:04.397
That would give me comfort.

30:04.599 --> 30:06.510
You and me both.

30:16.999 --> 30:18.398
Thanks for coming down.

30:18.599 --> 30:21.591
Must be important.
To drive all the way out to my house.

30:21.799 --> 30:23.790
We just need to ask you
a few questions.

30:23.999 --> 30:25.637
- About?
- Your ex-husband.

30:26.279 --> 30:28.076
When was the last time
you saw him?

30:28.279 --> 30:30.634
Years ago. Before I got remarried.

30:30.839 --> 30:33.353
Still talk to him occasionally. Why?

30:33.559 --> 30:37.234
Eduardo's severed arm was found
with several other dead bodies.

30:37.439 --> 30:39.669
We haven't been able
to locate the rest of Eduardo.

30:39.879 --> 30:40.868
Oh, my God.

30:41.079 --> 30:43.434
Has anybody from the Mexican
government contacted you?

30:43.639 --> 30:45.152
- Explained he was missing?
- No.

30:45.359 --> 30:48.078
We're trying to piece together
what he was doing in L.A.

30:48.279 --> 30:51.749
- Who his contacts were.
- He came up here.

30:51.959 --> 30:53.517
Twice a year, maybe three.

30:53.719 --> 30:54.868
You know why?

30:55.079 --> 30:57.274
He had family interests to attend to.

30:57.479 --> 30:58.468
Never got specific.

30:59.239 --> 31:02.117
Always stayed at a small hotel
in Koreatown.

31:02.319 --> 31:06.551
Could've afforded better
but this place is private.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.837
Where are we
on Romero and San Marcos?

31:10.039 --> 31:12.473
Eduardo Romero checked
into a hotel under an alias...

31:12.679 --> 31:14.510
...two days before they hacked
his arm off.

31:14.719 --> 31:17.711
That's why we couldn't find him.
Manager says he hasn't been back.

31:17.919 --> 31:20.797
Hotel manager gave the plate number
of the Mercedes he was driving.

31:20.999 --> 31:24.912
It's an open-ended rental out of LAX.
Car hasn't been returned yet.

31:25.119 --> 31:27.508
Whoever was driving that car
either chopped up Romero...

31:27.719 --> 31:30.028
...and the bodies on San Marcos
or they know who did.

31:30.239 --> 31:33.197
High-end rentals all have LoJacks.
We're on our way there now.

31:34.799 --> 31:35.948
Salvadorans are onboard.

31:36.159 --> 31:37.751
Let's see
where the Mexicans are at.

31:42.119 --> 31:44.713
We'll settle our part of the deal
when we're alone.

31:46.199 --> 31:48.508
Byz Lats wanted
to do the right thing.

31:49.119 --> 31:51.349
I can give you three shooters.

31:51.999 --> 31:53.830
We have witnesses who saw six.

31:54.039 --> 31:55.836
I'm saying there's only three.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.757
And you stop looking for any others.

32:04.599 --> 32:07.159
- We're not gonna do any better.
- Three murderers walk free.

32:07.359 --> 32:08.917
- Three don't.
- It closes this case.

32:09.119 --> 32:11.838
Gives us a break
from more bloodshed.

32:15.799 --> 32:17.391
Okay.

32:18.599 --> 32:19.714
Bring them in.

32:19.919 --> 32:22.797
The others will find their way
into our net eventually.

32:28.239 --> 32:30.548
The place you tracked me down,
put the gun to my head.

32:30.759 --> 32:32.477
Lose the Salvadorans there.

32:32.679 --> 32:34.954
We'll teach them how
to use a machete.

32:39.119 --> 32:41.952
You wanna get some backup on this?
What if Santi's setting us up?

32:42.159 --> 32:44.878
- His three shooters could be 10.
- This is a straight up deal.

32:45.079 --> 32:47.832
He wants us off the scent of whatever
the Byz Lats have brewing.

32:48.039 --> 32:50.473
Giving up these idiots is a bargain.

33:01.799 --> 33:03.835
You're not gonna believe this.

33:08.679 --> 33:10.431
What? What is it?

33:14.799 --> 33:16.790
Spin them this way.
We'll go in the side door.

33:16.999 --> 33:18.273
Let's go.

33:25.719 --> 33:26.913
- Show me your hands!
- Police!

33:27.119 --> 33:29.269
Get against the wall right now!
Against the wall.

33:29.479 --> 33:31.037
Don't move. Show me your hands.

33:31.239 --> 33:33.275
- On your head, man. On your head.
- Don't move.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.548
Don't you move.

33:34.759 --> 33:36.795
All aboard.

33:38.599 --> 33:40.988
Black Mercedes is in the garage.

33:42.559 --> 33:43.833
Ready?

33:45.079 --> 33:47.639
Don't move. Hands on your head.
Hands on your head.

33:49.439 --> 33:50.394
Turn around.

33:53.919 --> 33:55.716
Eduardo Romero?

33:58.319 --> 33:59.957
Glad we found the rest of you.

34:01.559 --> 34:04.232
- It's okay. We're the police.
- Fine. Leave.

34:04.439 --> 34:06.270
We need to ask you
a few questions first.

34:06.479 --> 34:07.798
What happened to your arm?

34:07.999 --> 34:09.591
I'm a Mexican official.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.471
Diplomatic immunity.

34:11.679 --> 34:14.398
- And I told you to leave.
- We need to get you to a hospital.

34:16.839 --> 34:18.067
Dutch.

34:21.599 --> 34:22.952
Ever hear of traveller's checks?

34:25.438 --> 34:27.270
The consulate office is furious.

34:27.478 --> 34:30.072
Claim Romero explicitly told you
not to bring him down here.

34:30.279 --> 34:33.476
Brought him in for protective custody.
They chopped the guy's arm off.

34:33.679 --> 34:35.670
Diplomatic immunity, Dutch.

34:35.879 --> 34:37.152
International protocol.

34:37.359 --> 34:39.509
This guy lost his arm
at a grisly crime scene.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.596
He had a suitcase
full of unexplained cash.

34:41.799 --> 34:44.393
He was present
at the San Marcos murders.

34:44.599 --> 34:46.317
Mexican consulate's here
in 5 minutes.

34:46.518 --> 34:49.511
- We'll never see this guy again.
- How we supposed to stop that?

34:50.438 --> 34:53.158
Romero held on to that cash
like it was his missing hand.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.031
Going home without it is
not an option.

34:55.239 --> 35:00.791
Want him to stick around, make sure
his $230,000 luggage gets lost.

35:01.239 --> 35:02.592
That amount of money is booked.

35:02.799 --> 35:05.677
Technically we should notify
and send to Narcotics.

35:05.879 --> 35:08.712
Thirty-five percent of bills test
positive for drug residue.

35:08.919 --> 35:10.398
A lot of bills, a lot of testing.

35:10.599 --> 35:12.476
Could be tied up
in the system a while.

35:12.679 --> 35:15.068
I'll expect a lot of angry calls
from diplomats.

35:15.279 --> 35:16.234
Mexican and our own.

35:16.439 --> 35:18.555
But maybe Romero hangs
around L.A. long enough...

35:18.759 --> 35:21.068
...for us to get into him
and crack this case.

35:24.679 --> 35:26.078
Get that suitcase out of here...

35:26.279 --> 35:29.476
...before his "get out of the country
free" card shows up.

35:31.879 --> 35:32.948
Open it.

35:33.159 --> 35:35.150
Your bail came through.

35:35.879 --> 35:37.358
Let's go.

35:40.039 --> 35:43.270
These are the shotgun Mexis,
broke up your little street fair today.

35:43.479 --> 35:45.834
Too bad you can't hang around,
get better acquainted.

35:47.399 --> 35:49.355
Get out. Get out!

36:01.439 --> 36:03.669
We kept our end of the deal,
delivered the shooters.

36:03.879 --> 36:06.347
- Let's hope Hernan can keep his.
- He will.

36:06.559 --> 36:09.392
We stopped the blood. For now.

36:16.519 --> 36:19.636
- Thanks again for the toys.
- You're welcome.

36:20.639 --> 36:22.675
I'm sorry if I said too much earlier.

36:22.879 --> 36:24.710
- I got a lot on my mind...
- It's no problem.

36:24.919 --> 36:27.353
I've been there myself, so...

36:29.679 --> 36:31.635
Something happened
between Vic and Shane.

36:31.839 --> 36:34.034
Some kind of rift and it's pretty bad.

36:34.239 --> 36:36.116
I don't get involved in Vic's business.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.196
Well, I get involved Shane's.

36:38.399 --> 36:40.515
We're still married.
And I'm worried about him.

36:40.719 --> 36:42.789
Maybe you should talk
to your children's father.

36:42.999 --> 36:45.797
What, you think Vic's gonna
do something to him?

36:46.439 --> 36:47.997
Tell Vic we don't want any trouble.

36:48.199 --> 36:50.588
- He can get hurt too.
- What?

36:50.799 --> 36:53.313
He has just as much to lose
as we do, if not more.

36:53.519 --> 36:57.671
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Just tell him, okay?

37:06.919 --> 37:08.318
Hey.

37:08.919 --> 37:10.398
Number 1? How much?

37:10.599 --> 37:11.668
All of it.

37:11.879 --> 37:13.437
I need to see your supply invoices.

37:13.639 --> 37:14.788
My gasoline is legal, man.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.911
I'm the one with the badge.
I'll decide whether it's legal or not.

37:18.439 --> 37:20.395
You can't just order me
to show information.

37:20.599 --> 37:21.793
You need a warrant.

37:21.999 --> 37:23.671
Might wanna have a look
at that badge.

37:23.879 --> 37:26.677
That gives me the right
to your receipts.

37:27.799 --> 37:29.517
I'm a citizen, man.

37:29.719 --> 37:32.028
Yeah? Not in my world.

37:45.359 --> 37:47.998
See here you got a shipment
coming tonight from Nawzad Oil.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.155
Maybe they're on
the Homeland Security watch.

37:50.359 --> 37:51.838
You're gonna refuse that shipment.

37:52.039 --> 37:54.075
That's bullshit, man.
I need the gasoline.

37:54.279 --> 37:57.351
Don't worry. Another supplier
will be here to fill up all your tanks.

37:57.559 --> 37:59.834
- What supplier?
- I'm not sure.

38:00.039 --> 38:02.314
But I'm guessing it ends in l-A-N.

38:02.519 --> 38:03.713
The Armenians.

38:03.919 --> 38:05.591
They put you up to this?

38:05.799 --> 38:08.313
Nobody puts me up to anything.

38:08.519 --> 38:12.512
I'm just a guy looking out
for the best interests of his country.

38:14.279 --> 38:16.668
I'll be back tonight
to check on your patriotism.

38:31.319 --> 38:33.071
Where's Hernan?

38:33.279 --> 38:35.190
He called me. He's 20 minutes late.

38:35.399 --> 38:37.037
I know. We lost contact with him.

38:37.239 --> 38:38.308
What's that mean?

38:38.519 --> 38:40.953
Any way you could have compromised
his cover?

38:41.159 --> 38:45.789
No. No, you saw our operation.
It was strictly on a need-to-know basis.

38:46.959 --> 38:48.438
Shit.

39:05.119 --> 39:08.156
Claudette Wyms,
captain at the Barn.

39:09.359 --> 39:14.717
I found this buried under paperwork
when I moved into my office.

39:14.919 --> 39:17.035
It was taken from Ben
when he was being processed.

39:17.239 --> 39:18.433
Never made its way to you.

39:22.239 --> 39:25.037
And you thought now would be
the right time to return them?

39:26.919 --> 39:28.477
No.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.796
You seemed upset at the Barn today.

39:30.999 --> 39:32.398
Wondering if I could help.

39:34.079 --> 39:35.990
It's nothing. It's taken care of.

39:39.719 --> 39:41.152
I have two girls.

39:41.359 --> 39:43.748
A little older, same age difference.

39:43.959 --> 39:46.598
Can't find a picture of my ex
anywhere either.

39:46.799 --> 39:48.676
Guess we knew
how to pick them, right?

39:49.999 --> 39:51.717
Mine had his demons.

39:51.919 --> 39:54.069
He was shot in the head,
front seat of the car...

39:54.279 --> 39:56.554
...with my oldest sitting next to him.

39:56.759 --> 39:58.351
How they dealing with that?

39:59.839 --> 40:01.750
I don't know. Seem okay.

40:01.959 --> 40:04.632
Never know what's going on
in their heads.

40:05.599 --> 40:07.794
No, they don't tell you anything.

40:07.999 --> 40:09.910
Well, after a while you stop asking.

40:10.119 --> 40:11.598
Good night.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.876
You ever blame yourself?

40:15.679 --> 40:17.909
Putting them through all that shit?

40:19.559 --> 40:20.833
Not anymore.

40:22.159 --> 40:23.751
Good for you.

40:24.399 --> 40:26.230
You need my help, you call me.

40:28.719 --> 40:29.947
A few weeks ago...

40:30.839 --> 40:34.752
...V ic wanted to know how Ben
got ahold of cash down in Mexico.

40:35.839 --> 40:37.750
You wired him money
when he was on the run?

40:38.759 --> 40:42.593
- That would be aiding and abetting.
- Tough choice for a wife and mother.

40:44.359 --> 40:47.431
Vendrell came by today,
wanted the same information.

40:47.639 --> 40:48.958
He's all jacked up.

40:49.159 --> 40:53.391
- I just don't want Vic and his guys to...
- I won't let them hurt you in this.

40:59.879 --> 41:03.189
One-Tango-13, I have a white male,
possible DB.

41:03.399 --> 41:05.867
- Requesting an RA unit.
- Jesus.

41:06.079 --> 41:08.877
Thinking premium
or regular unleaded?

41:22.599 --> 41:24.794
Don't come to this house again.

41:25.679 --> 41:27.988
Keeping the widow warm
since the old man's been gone?

41:28.199 --> 41:29.917
You've destroyed enough families.

41:30.119 --> 41:32.110
You leave hers alone.

41:35.039 --> 41:36.154
Don't worry.

41:36.359 --> 41:39.271
It's not like it's a live grenade
or anything.

41:40.279 --> 41:41.997
It's Gilroy's Mexican information.

41:43.199 --> 41:44.871
Good luck on the goat farm.

41:45.079 --> 41:47.991
I hear Juárez P. D 's looking
for a few good hombres.

41:48.199 --> 41:49.473
Think if I was gonna run...

41:49.679 --> 41:52.193
...I 'd set up the same deal
we had for Lem?

41:52.399 --> 41:54.196
One you knew all the details to?

41:54.399 --> 41:57.835
Come on, Vic,
you taught me better than that.

41:58.039 --> 42:00.951
I knew if I cranked up Nancy's motor
it'd get you here.

42:01.159 --> 42:03.434
On neutral ground.

42:04.759 --> 42:06.989
So that I could give you this.

42:09.239 --> 42:10.194
What is it?

42:10.399 --> 42:13.471
The original is in a warm, safe place.

42:14.079 --> 42:18.595
Now, anything happens to me
or my wife or my son...

42:18.799 --> 42:23.111
...even my mailman,
anybody that I am close to...

42:23.319 --> 42:25.355
...that lands on IAD's doorstep.

42:26.919 --> 42:31.868
Just imagine every wrong,
brutal thing we have ever done.

42:33.079 --> 42:34.637
It's hard to do, isn't it?

42:34.839 --> 42:36.875
We've done so many.
