00:20.310 --> 00:23.350
Chuunin Exams Second Preliminary Venue

00:23.440 --> 00:24.640
Drill Area 4 AKA Demonic Sea, Keep Out

00:32.049 --> 00:33.650
From now on, we're rivals!

00:45.140 --> 00:46.220
Kage Bunshin no...

00:46.430 --> 00:47.270
Rasengan!

01:05.370 --> 01:10.730
Naruto-nii-chan! T-Thank you...

01:10.790 --> 01:13.990
You'll drop out from the preliminary if you keep loitering around here!

01:14.440 --> 01:15.670
You guys all right?

01:15.880 --> 01:16.340
Yeah!

01:16.460 --> 01:18.300
Oh, for goodness sake!

01:18.880 --> 01:21.130
Why'd you come in at the best part?!

01:21.470 --> 01:24.130
I was just about to showcase my skills!

01:24.720 --> 01:26.800
Sorry...

01:27.430 --> 01:31.520
Moegi! Udon! Let's go look for another monster!

01:31.940 --> 01:33.310
Konohamaru-chan!

01:33.560 --> 01:34.520
Wait!

01:34.690 --> 01:37.900
Heeey! Taking out monsters isn't in the rules, you know?

01:39.780 --> 01:42.570
That Konohamaru sure is hyped up!

01:44.360 --> 01:46.530
Fiery Chuunin Exam!

01:48.280 --> 01:50.450
Naruto VS Konohamaru!

01:54.380 --> 02:02.020
As you know, the Chuunin exam this time is being held despite preparations for the 4th Shinobi War.

02:02.560 --> 02:06.520
The purpose is not to compare abilities between villages like it was before,

02:07.230 --> 02:10.150
but to beef up the Shinobi Alliance's forces.

02:13.240 --> 02:14.320
Congratulations.

02:16.530 --> 02:19.450
All of you have successfully entered the 2nd preliminary.

02:20.870 --> 02:23.580
Having won a place in this preliminary, in the matches ahead...

02:23.960 --> 02:25.920
Hey, isn't that...

02:26.460 --> 02:29.000
Yeah... that one who saved Hidden Leaf by himself...

02:29.340 --> 02:31.300
No way! Isn't that Uzumaki Naruto-san?!

02:31.670 --> 02:35.260
Why is thot monster in the Chuunin exams?!

02:35.680 --> 02:36.930
I heard Naruto-san's still Genin.

02:38.140 --> 02:39.760
You must be joking!

02:39.970 --> 02:42.010
Naruto-nii-chan's the center of attraction!

02:42.270 --> 02:47.850
Of course! After all, he's the number one shinobi of the Hidden Leaf!

02:48.310 --> 02:49.940
I'll now explain the rules of this round.

02:50.860 --> 02:53.610
You will be fighting each other one-on-one in a freestyle sparring match.

02:54.360 --> 02:59.950
Although this exam is irregular, if s still a place for you to showcase your skills.

03:00.580 --> 03:01.780
Fight with everything you've got!

03:03.500 --> 03:04.660
Konohamaru!

03:06.410 --> 03:08.420
Let's become Chuunin together!

03:08.960 --> 03:10.080
Of course!

03:10.960 --> 03:13.840
I'm gonna become a Chuunin for sure!

03:14.170 --> 03:17.220
Looks like you're even allset to defeat me, huh?

03:17.680 --> 03:20.390
Yeah! Because you're my rival!

03:20.600 --> 03:24.600
Yeah! And I won't lose to you either!

03:25.520 --> 03:27.980
This is what you are, nii-chan!

03:28.190 --> 03:31.690
Whaat?! I can defeat you with just one finger!

03:32.270 --> 03:33.820
I'll make mincemeat outta you!

03:33.940 --> 03:35.320
I'll tear you from limb to limb!

03:37.740 --> 03:39.780
Hey!!! Naruto!

03:40.410 --> 03:43.700
Listen to what she's saying! It's important!

03:43.990 --> 03:45.160
Sakura, shut up!

03:54.460 --> 03:56.760
You remember this, Naruto!

03:57.170 --> 04:00.220
Sakura-chan... scary...

04:00.760 --> 04:06.810
All right: Well now announce the pairs that will be fighting each other.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.730
Examiners, take your positions.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.770
Round one.

04:14.400 --> 04:18.110
Uzumaki Naruto VS Sarutobi Konohamaru.

04:18.990 --> 04:22.530
All right! I'm getting all fired up!!

04:24.080 --> 04:26.240
Uzumaki Naruto right off the,bat!

04:27.120 --> 04:28.950
This is gonna be an intense match.

04:29.210 --> 04:31.330
I pity that little kid.

04:31.790 --> 04:34.000
Shouldn't we be running away?

04:34.540 --> 04:38.010
Uzumaki Naruto is a Jinchuuriki, right?

04:38.300 --> 04:41.300
And he can't control the Kyuubi, either...

04:41.840 --> 04:44.090
If that kid tries too hard and Kyuubi goes berserk...

04:45.310 --> 04:46.470
I'd welcome that.

04:48.310 --> 04:49.020
Konohamaru-chan...

04:49.180 --> 04:52.440
Of all the people... How could this happen!

04:53.060 --> 04:56.400
Though we may be instructors, there's nothing we can do at times like this?

04:57.230 --> 05:00.650
Except to trust in them and cheer them on.

05:03.910 --> 05:06.740
Konohamaru-kun! Go for it!!

05:07.120 --> 05:08.870
Do your best!

05:09.330 --> 05:11.660
Go get em, kiddo!

05:12.330 --> 05:14.330
Don't let'em get too full of himself!

05:14.670 --> 05:19.250
Go for it! Konohamaru!

05:21.760 --> 05:26.140
Oh boy... But I do want to have a serious match with Konohamaru.

05:30.350 --> 05:31.100
Nii-chan.

05:32.270 --> 05:35.520
I think I've been waiting for this day.

05:37.150 --> 05:38.570
It's a chance!

05:39.280 --> 05:41.490
Everyone has their attention on this match!

05:42.030 --> 05:44.450
Everyone's looking at you and me!

05:44.700 --> 05:47.030
I can show everyone my way of fighting!

05:47.780 --> 05:54.080
This is a great chance for me, Konohamaru, a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf, to be acknowledged!

05:54.670 --> 05:55.710
Let's do this, nii-chan!

05:55.960 --> 05:57.750
Come on, Konohamaru!

05:58.550 --> 05:59.290
Start!

06:02.550 --> 06:03.300
Oodama Rasengan!

06:05.640 --> 06:07.760
Wait... I haven't taught you that yet!

06:08.010 --> 06:10.970
I'm not gonna be chasing after you all the time!

06:14.600 --> 06:16.150
Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jiitsu!

06:21.070 --> 06:22.570
Tajuu Kage Bunshinno Jutsu!

06:47.510 --> 06:48.180
What?

06:48.390 --> 06:49.470
What did they do?

06:51.310 --> 06:53.640
Hey, that kid...

06:54.140 --> 06:55.680
He's down already?

06:56.730 --> 06:59.610
Well that goes without saying.

06:59.770 --> 07:01.820
Yeah. Uzumaki Naruto wins this!

07:03.070 --> 07:06.070
Next match! Start the next round already!

07:06.570 --> 07:08.200
Sorry, Konohamaru!

07:08.870 --> 07:11.120
But I gotta become Chuunin too!

07:11.660 --> 07:13.660
Because Konohamaru has been knocked out...

07:16.210 --> 07:17.710
Can you continue?

07:18.460 --> 07:20.380
Of course...

07:22.710 --> 07:28.840
I haven't hit Naruto-nii-chan even once!

07:29.640 --> 07:32.300
That's the spirit, Konohamaru!

07:56.960 --> 07:58.710
Isn't that bit too much?

07:59.500 --> 08:00.870
He's even going this far?

08:01.130 --> 08:02.710
You're one to talk.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.420
That Naruto guy..

08:06.460 --> 08:07.630
He can't hold back.

08:10.140 --> 08:13.220
Because Naruto understands his opponent's feelings.

08:14.430 --> 08:16.430
There's just no way he'd do something...

08:17.060 --> 08:18.520
that'd make a fool out of his opponent.

08:26.530 --> 08:29.740
I really wanted to at least hit him once...

08:30.990 --> 08:36.580
I guess... Naruto-nii-chan's really...

08:36.789 --> 08:38.080
One step closer to being Hokage!

08:38.580 --> 08:42.710
If you want the name of Hokage, you have to defeat me first!

08:43.000 --> 08:45.290
I'm not gonna be your underling anymore!

08:46.250 --> 08:49.010
From now on, we're rivals!

08:58.890 --> 09:00.730
Don't lose!

09:01.020 --> 09:02.310
You can do it!

09:02.440 --> 09:03.400
Konohamaru!

09:03.860 --> 09:06.520
Konohamaru! Try hitting me once!

09:11.150 --> 09:12.650
Shunken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!

09:14.660 --> 09:15.070
What?!

09:15.450 --> 09:16.700
Gooo!?

09:23.210 --> 09:25.250
That was Gramps' jutsu!

09:25.710 --> 09:27.460
And...

09:27.710 --> 09:30.090
Katon, Haiseki Shou!

09:31.510 --> 09:33.630
Wait, wait! Time out!

09:35.800 --> 09:40.520
And this was Uncle Asuma's jutsu!

09:43.730 --> 09:45.190
That kid's pretty good!

09:45.480 --> 09:46.480
Ouch, hot!

09:48.650 --> 09:49.900
I have no more shuriken.

09:50.610 --> 09:52.070
I've run out of chakra too.

09:52.570 --> 09:55.160
But...

09:56.240 --> 09:57.530
At least one hit?

09:57.780 --> 10:00.040
That Konohamaru's being too enthusiastic!

10:01.200 --> 10:02.040
Oh no!

10:08.920 --> 10:10.050
I hit him.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.090
Yeah!!

10:15.640 --> 10:17.640
You did it, Konohamaru!

10:17.850 --> 10:19.760
You're awesome, Konohamaru-chan!

10:20.470 --> 10:21.430
Not bad.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.180
My name is...

10:24.020 --> 10:25.770
Sarutobi Konohamaru!

10:26.850 --> 10:29.310
The man who's gonna become Hokage!

10:32.900 --> 10:36.200
I won't let you have it so easily, Konohamaru!

10:37.570 --> 10:38.450
Oh yeah!

10:41.240 --> 10:41.910
Idiot.

10:42.250 --> 10:42.830
Idiot.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.040
Idiot.

10:44.960 --> 10:45.910
Idiot.

10:47.670 --> 10:49.080
Idiot.

10:50.670 --> 10:55.260
We've specially set up a few excpetions for the tournament this time.

10:56.010 --> 10:59.470
One: No Senjutsu allowed!

11:00.260 --> 11:03.640
It's a handicap so the others have a chance.

11:06.310 --> 11:09.440
Uzumaki Naruto is disqualified for going against the rules.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.860
Sarutobi Konohamaru wins!

11:27.710 --> 11:28.710
Eeeh?!

12:45.740 --> 12:46.780
What the heck is this?!

12:50.350 --> 12:51.470
Naruto.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.150
You can become Chuunin anytime.

12:56.820 --> 13:00.570
You're already above me in terms of skills, after all.

13:00.790 --> 13:05.420
That's right! After all, you're the hero of Hidden Leaf!

13:05.570 --> 13:09.640
Aww... I'm not THAT good...

13:09.780 --> 13:12.080
You're finally back to normal.

13:12.690 --> 13:14.020
Let's go bock.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.940
Hold it right there.

13:16.330 --> 13:19.100
I wanna say something too!

13:24.990 --> 13:26.830
Good for you, Konohamaru!

13:26.760 --> 13:29.680
From today on, you're my subordinate!

13:31.100 --> 13:33.570
What the?!

14:17.300 --> 14:19.390
Nothing from Houzuki Castle yet?

14:23.870 --> 14:26.260
We've located the box, but

14:26.390 --> 14:28.780
security is so tight, we can't make any moves yet.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.260
Keep monitoring things.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.040
Once there's a chance, steal it!

14:33.610 --> 14:34.130
Understood.

14:34.870 --> 14:36.610
Is there really such a box?

14:37.390 --> 14:39.690
A box that can grant any wish... How suspicious is that?

14:40.350 --> 14:42.690
No... we can't say that for sure.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.350
Although it does sound ridiculous,

14:45.690 --> 14:50.560
the box itself may be just a metaphor, whereas it's actually referring to a powerful weapon.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.430
If that is the case, then we...

14:52.690 --> 14:55.650
Argh! Will you just shut up already?!

14:56.560 --> 15:00.520
Does a box like that really exist, Raikage-sama?

15:01.910 --> 15:07.130
If s said that the Hidden Grass Village almost took over the world once with this box.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.950
We can't just let it alone.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.560
Have you contacted the Hidden Leaf yet?

15:12.560 --> 15:17.950
Hokage-sama has expressed her agreement to work together with us.

15:21.390 --> 15:22.390
All personal differences will have to be put aside for now.

15:22.390 --> 15:25.780
Of course she has. This is a matter of great importance to ALL the villages.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.390
What's going on?!

15:52.090 --> 15:53.080
Who goes there?!

16:03.960 --> 16:04.430
Simpleton!

16:23.690 --> 16:24.870
You're...

16:40.350 --> 16:44.080
Looks like things are progressing at a much faster rate than we've expected.

16:44.650 --> 16:45.950
It can't be helped. Summon Bee!

16:47.690 --> 16:51.130
We don't have to bother Killer Bee-sama for something like this!

16:52.650 --> 16:54.950
We cannot afford to fail this time.

16:55.430 --> 16:56.820
Summon Bee immediately!

17:00.870 --> 17:03.210
The Roikoge was attacked last night.

17:04.390 --> 17:08.079
The Hidden Cloud Village says that you were the culprit, Naruto.

17:08.390 --> 17:10.560
What? No way! I didn't do anything

17:11.390 --> 17:14.910
Oh, Granny Tsunade! You're joking with me again, right? Have been killed.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.819
Three Hidden Cloud Jounin and two others from Hidden Stone

17:20.220 --> 17:25.000
These are drawings of the culprit sent from the Hidden Mist and Hidden Stone.

17:25.430 --> 17:28.690
That can't be! Naruto wouldn't do something like that!

17:29.090 --> 17:30.910
This has to be a mistake, Tsunade-sama!

17:31.090 --> 17:31.690
Silence!

17:32.130 --> 17:32.820
But!

17:33.000 --> 17:35.430
This is a diplomatic problem between villages

17:37.350 --> 17:38.560
It wasn't me!

17:39.130 --> 17:43.390
Kakashi-sensei, please believe me! Yesterday, I was eating ramen at Ichiraku,

17:43.610 --> 17:48.130
and then... then I was playing shogi with Shikamaru the whole night!

17:48.430 --> 17:53.130
Naruto! Until the truth of the matter is revealed, we'll be sending you to Houzuki Castle.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.820
W-Whaf s that Houzuki Castle place?

17:57.610 --> 18:01.690
A shinobi prison focility delegated to the Hidden Grass by the other villages.

18:02.220 --> 18:06.170
Anyone can enter that place, but not everyone can leave.

18:06.690 --> 18:11.260
If s a place where they restrain problematic shinobi sent to them ibythe various villages.

18:11.690 --> 18:14.560
But I haven't done anything!

18:14.780 --> 18:16.870
Someone must be trying to get me away from the village!

18:17.040 --> 18:18.040
Don't be absurd, Naruto!

18:19.060 --> 18:20.150
Kage Bunshin no...

18:20.210 --> 18:21.380
Mokuton! Shichuurou! (Wood Arts, Four Pillars Prison)

18:26.600 --> 18:27.860
W-Wait!

18:31.730 --> 18:32.780
It wasn't me!

18:35.080 --> 18:36.340
Take him away

18:38.260 --> 18:41.340
I haven't done anything!!

19:41.340 --> 19:41.860
Attention!

19:42.390 --> 19:47.690
Mui-sama, the owner of Houzuki Castle, will be addressing you now!

19:48.040 --> 19:49.120
Listen well!

19:53.260 --> 19:54.990
I am Mui, the person in charge of this place.

19:56.080 --> 20:02.430
The fact that you've been sent here means that you've completely lost the trust of your villages.

20:02.600 --> 20:07.120
Therefore, I want you to remember that you're all equally worthless...

20:07.210 --> 20:08.600
I was framed!

20:08.860 --> 20:12.120
I haven't done anything! Really! I've been falsely accused!

20:12.430 --> 20:13.690
Do not speak without permission!

20:15.390 --> 20:18.910
You're saying someone schemed to send you here?

20:18.990 --> 20:20.910
I can't be wasting my time here!

20:21.260 --> 20:24.300
I gotta find the real culprit, or the village will be in danger

20:24.990 --> 20:28.560
Here in the Hidden Grass, our assignment from the various villages

20:28.990 --> 20:32.120
is to ensure that those who get sent here do not escape.

20:32.650 --> 20:35.650
It's none of our business what your circumstances are.

20:36.690 --> 20:37.820
Katon, Tenrou! (Fire Arts, Sky Prison)

20:41.910 --> 20:44.510
An imprisonment jutsu passed down through our clan.

20:44.990 --> 20:50.210
Ifs because of this Tenrou that the Hidden Grass has been entrusted with the oversight of Houzuki Castle.

20:52.390 --> 20:55.120
As long as that seal is upon your body, you won't be able to make chakra.

20:55.260 --> 20:59.860
There are only two ways you can leave this place.

21:00.690 --> 21:04.340
First, if your village submits an official request for your release.

21:04.600 --> 21:08.040
And the second way is if you die.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.300
Hah! Once I'm free, you're no match for me!

21:11.650 --> 21:13.650
Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu! (Art of Multiple Shadow Clones)

21:23.300 --> 21:27.300
What... my body feels... so hot... like it-son fire...

21:28.300 --> 21:30.300
You're quite something, aren't you?

21:30.860 --> 21:34.560
Despite being under Tenrou, you could actually make that much chakra...

21:34.910 --> 21:37.430
But don't think you can escape.

21:37.990 --> 21:43.430
When you're a certain distance away from me, Tenrou will kick in and burn you to ashes

21:44.120 --> 21:46.120
By the way...

21:46.650 --> 21:50.170
Tenrou is a fire style jutsu that doesn't work in the water.

21:50.690 --> 21:54.170
However, the water around this place is deep and the fast-moving.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.690
Jump in, and you'll be drowned before you can even use any chakra.

22:12.120 --> 22:17.430
Once you're sealed by Mui-sama's Tenrou, you'll never be able to escape from this place.

22:18.170 --> 22:22.080
Well, this is a pretty nice place once you get used to it.

22:27.600 --> 22:31.120
Look at how your seniors are welcoming you.

22:32.430 --> 22:33.560
Hey... we've got newbies.

22:33.910 --> 22:36.250
Yo, yo! Now aren't you a fine looking one!

22:37.210 --> 22:39.990
I'll take real good care of you later...

22:44.560 --> 22:47.860
Before that, you guys have to go through a body examination!

22:48.690 --> 22:54.690
I'll personally search through every nook and cranny of your body...

23:05.390 --> 23:07.560
Hey! So what did you do?

23:07.860 --> 23:11.650
I already said I haven't done anything!

23:11.990 --> 23:13.250
Ooh, scary

23:13.560 --> 23:16.170
As for me, I made a mistake during a mission.

23:16.730 --> 23:24.730
I was supposed to wiped out a certain village, but conscience struck and I let a kid get away.

23:24.860 --> 23:26.300
Then my village found out.

23:26.650 --> 23:28.250
What's wrong with that?

23:28.990 --> 23:30.690
Which village are you from?

23:31.560 --> 23:32.860
Hidden.Leaf.

23:34.430 --> 23:38.380
Looks like the Hidden Leafs a pretty soft village, huh?

23:38.730 --> 23:40.170
What did you say?!

23:40.690 --> 23:43.510
To a shinobi, the village's command is absolute.

23:43.860 --> 23:47.430
But it looks like that's not how it rolls in your Hidden Leaf village, huh?

23:49.990 --> 23:53.340
Don't you dore talk bad about the Hidden Leaf when you don't even know anything about it!

23:55.560 --> 23:58.780
Just you wait and see! I'll get outta here quickly

23:58.910 --> 24:00.990
and give the guy who framed me a lesson he'll never forget!

24:02.600 --> 24:04.250
That's enough.

24:04.820 --> 24:05.470
What?!

24:06.950 --> 24:08.650
That man is right.

24:09.430 --> 24:10.690
This Houzuki Castle is a gathering spot

24:10.690 --> 24:13.820
of people who no longer have the pretext where villages cover them for what they've done.

24:14.650 --> 24:17.820
A thief is a thief. A murderer is a murderer.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.430
We have no excuse anymore.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.600
I'm not making excuses!

24:24.910 --> 24:27.780
Bandanna! Come!

24:29.430 --> 24:32.170
If you've realized you've already fallen into a deep pit,

24:32.690 --> 24:34.860
then you'll try not to make it even deeper.

24:36.730 --> 24:38.340
What do you mean?

24:41.210 --> 24:42.600
Think about it yourself.

24:47.780 --> 24:48.780
Take off your clothes.

24:55.470 --> 24:56.650
Nothing.

25:00.430 --> 25:03.950
Right. Now jump on the spot on alternate legs.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.560
Huh? What's that for?

25:07.260 --> 25:09.600
If s to check if you're hiding anything in your body.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.250
Hurry up!

25:11.860 --> 25:13.170
Sheesh...

25:30.860 --> 25:32.600
Looks like there's no problem.

25:32.860 --> 25:35.300
What was that for, seriously?

25:36.990 --> 25:37.950
Not yet.

25:39.340 --> 25:41.300
There's nowhere else I could be hiding anything already!

25:41.820 --> 25:43.120
Take your pants off.

25:43.260 --> 25:43.780
What?!

25:45.120 --> 25:47.510
Stop...

25:48.560 --> 25:51.080
Stop!!!

25:54.440 --> 25:56.740
Exercise time for today is over.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.310
All prisoners are to return to their cells immediately for a roll call.

26:00.440 --> 26:01.870
The time has come, Maroi.

26:01.920 --> 26:06.000
I repeat. Exercise time for today is over.

26:06.960 --> 26:10.610
All prisoners are to return to their cells immediately for a roll call.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.180
Who's that?!

26:44.480 --> 26:46.610
Sleeping so soundly on your first day here?

26:46.830 --> 26:49.830
You're either really good, or really stupid.

27:07.140 --> 27:10.440
This is really suffocating... I don't like it.

27:23.180 --> 27:24.740
You messed up, Maroi.

27:41.660 --> 27:46.440
Dammit... Just one Bunshin is the best I can do now...

27:47.180 --> 27:49.130
Sleeping so soundly on your first day here?

27:49.400 --> 27:52.220
You're either really good, or really stupid.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.440
Thankfully I didn't end up becoming like one of you...

28:58.440 --> 29:00.700
They've already found out...

29:05.660 --> 29:06.870
Team one, to the front!

29:07.400 --> 29:09.180
Teams two and three, hurry to the cliff sides!

29:38.920 --> 29:40.440
One escapee secured.

29:40.870 --> 29:44.790
According to Houzuki Castle's Penalty Article 23, he will be brought to the punishment cell.

29:45.530 --> 29:47.570
Uh oh! He's been caught!

29:47.870 --> 29:50.180
I thought he'd try a little harder than that...

29:51.180 --> 29:52.530
But, what shall we do now?

29:53.270 --> 29:55.740
The rules say that he'll have to be put in the punishment cell for 3 days.

29:55.830 --> 29:57.610
We won't be able to get him during that time...

29:58.010 --> 30:02.220
After all, there may be Flower group spies among the guards...

30:42.570 --> 30:45.400
Are you sure he's the Jinchuuriki?

30:45.920 --> 30:50.090
The time for the revival of the Hidden Grass Village has finally arrived.

30:50.270 --> 30:53.530
The time for you to avenge your son's death has come, Mui.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.870
We must execute the plan quickly.

30:56.350 --> 31:01.700
We've received reports that the Flower Group has already sent spies to infiltrate this place.

31:02.050 --> 31:05.310
By the way, what are we going to do with Kazan of the Hidden Bath?

31:05.830 --> 31:10.920
Kazan is quite strong. We may not be able to restrain him unless all four of us face him together.

31:11.350 --> 31:16.000
Do not worry. For we have already gotten hold of his weakness.

31:22.910 --> 31:24.250
Are you there?

31:25.430 --> 31:26.250
Who's that?

31:26.590 --> 31:28.330
Just a nameless little fly.

31:28.700 --> 31:30.480
More importantly, do you want to leave this place?

31:31.220 --> 31:32.480
Is that possible?

31:33.910 --> 31:35.170
What should I do?

31:37.300 --> 31:39.260
Just defeat Mui, and the seal on your chest will disappear.

31:40.970 --> 31:42.690
Why you telling me this?

31:44.990 --> 31:45.690
Hey!

31:58.170 --> 31:58.910
Hold it!

32:02.130 --> 32:03.600
You've been released?

32:03.740 --> 32:05.860
So was the punishment room comfortable enough?

32:05.950 --> 32:09.170
I can't keep staying in this place!

32:09.390 --> 32:12.520
Not at this time when someone's trying to take down my village!

32:13.470 --> 32:15.990
What has that got to do with me?

32:16.470 --> 32:19.520
I heard that the Tenrou seal will disappear if I defeat you.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.170
I don't wanna do it, but if that's the only way, then...

32:25.390 --> 32:27.040
Forget it.

32:27.520 --> 32:30.300
You cannot defeat me in your current state.

32:31.340 --> 32:34.080
We won't know until we try!

32:38.690 --> 32:40.780
What is your village to you?

32:41.300 --> 32:41.820
Why you...

32:46.650 --> 32:52.080
Have you ever killed an innocent person just to protect your village?

32:52.870 --> 32:57.040
Are you saying we can't protect our villages without doing that?

32:57.910 --> 32:59.040
That's right.

32:59.520 --> 33:00.600
Don't make me laugh!

33:01.740 --> 33:03.860
It hurts to even breath, right?

33:04.680 --> 33:07.500
You must be thinking, this can't be happening!

33:08.290 --> 33:11.890
That you couldn't have been so hurt by a move like that.

33:12.630 --> 33:15.280
When you fight, somehow, you'll have to use chakra.

33:15.420 --> 33:19.890
If your chakra even so much as twitches, Tenrou kicks inland bums up your body.

33:20.810 --> 33:22.070
Dammit...

33:22.240 --> 33:24.020
My body's not listening to me...

33:24.810 --> 33:26.150
Let me tell you something

33:26.460 --> 33:29.940
No matter how much you've had to bear because of your village,

33:30.200 --> 33:33.280
they don't care at all

33:34.200 --> 33:36.850
Let me go! We're not done yet!

33:37.370 --> 33:41.110
I guess you realty like the punishment room, huh?

33:41.630 --> 33:44.070
Going'back in once you come out...

33:44.330 --> 33:49.680
Houzuki Castle Penalty Article 23 Clause 6! Your second time in the room is 5 days!

33:49.720 --> 33:52.020
Hopefully that'll cool your head down!

33:59.030 --> 34:04.110
Have you ever killed an innocent person just to protect your village?

34:04.760 --> 34:07.330
What is your village to you?

34:55.030 --> 34:56.330
Box of Extreme Bliss.

34:56.810 --> 35:00.760
It brings forth enlightenment, actuates enlightenment, and ends in enlightenment.

35:03.720 --> 35:07.240
In any case, what awaits is destruction.

35:11.960 --> 35:15.070
Your punishment ends today. Uzumaki Naruto, come out!

35:42.330 --> 35:45.760
Ooh! There's ramen in the Hidden Grass too?

35:45.940 --> 35:48.590
I'd bet it loses to Ichiroku, though!

36:02.330 --> 36:04.280
W-W-What do you want?

36:04.760 --> 36:07.760
If you wanna fight... I'll take you on! Come on!

36:24.760 --> 36:25.630
Whaf s going on?

36:26.200 --> 36:27.150
Go on.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.630
Don't really get it, but...

36:30.550 --> 36:33.330
Yeah! Thank you, thank you

36:33.810 --> 36:36.200
Uzumaki Naruto from the Hidden Leaf, at your service!

36:36.500 --> 36:38.330
Nice to meet you

36:40.200 --> 36:41.590
My name's Maroi.

36:42.070 --> 36:44.760
Man, you're already a hero here, you know?

36:46.070 --> 36:46.890
Hero?

36:47.630 --> 36:49.370
Suddenly escaping on your first day here,

36:49.460 --> 36:53.890
and challenging that Mui right after coming out from, the punishment room!

36:55.070 --> 36:57.760
We have no chance against him without chakra.

36:58.590 --> 37:02.330
Yet you went right at him with just guts and determination!

37:02.460 --> 37:04.760
It's not something anyone can do!

37:05.240 --> 37:07.760
Aww, you make me blush.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.150
I'm serious!

37:10.460 --> 37:13.630
A shinobi is just a normal human without chakra, after all.

37:14.370 --> 37:18.550
The guys here don't try to stir up too much trouble, either.

37:18.940 --> 37:20.150
It's pretty peaceful.

37:22.590 --> 37:24.150
Hey, there's a fight!

37:24.460 --> 37:26.420
Some guys are picking a fight with Mui!

37:27.980 --> 37:29.590
Didn't you just say it's peaceful?

37:31.330 --> 37:34.590
Well, you know? They've been influenced by your actions, yeah?

37:37.720 --> 37:39.810
Hey! Stop!

37:43.460 --> 37:47.420
So if we defeat you, we can get rid of this accursed seal on us, right?

37:48.030 --> 37:48.850
Stop.

37:49.200 --> 37:53.150
Those marked with Tenrou should just stay here obediently.

37:53.680 --> 37:54.810
Die!

38:04.500 --> 38:06.460
Hidden Leaf Style, Happashou! (Blast Palm)

38:29.890 --> 38:31.280
Tenrou Kaken! (Sky Prison, Fire Sword)

38:54.290 --> 38:55.200
Those idiots!

38:55.720 --> 38:57.020
Call the medic team, quickly!

39:01.760 --> 39:03.150
What the heck!..

39:03.890 --> 39:05.110
Don't do it!

39:05.290 --> 39:07.330
I can't forgive that jerk Mui!

39:08.160 --> 39:09.810
I've already been here for two years.

39:10.330 --> 39:12.590
so I know most of what's going on here.

39:13.110 --> 39:14.720
That guy he just burnt,

39:14.940 --> 39:18.590
he'd poisoned a certain village and wiped them all out.

39:19.760 --> 39:20.890
Why'd he do that?

39:22.030 --> 39:25.590
To take revenge on a woman who wouldn't bend to his will.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.020
Treasure your life, okay?

39:29.720 --> 39:32.850
Why waste it risking yourself for a piece of trash like that?

39:37.200 --> 39:39.200
Exercise time for today is over.

39:39.760 --> 39:43.810
All prisoners are to return to their cells immediately for a roll call.

39:44.460 --> 39:47.850
I repeat. Exercise time for today is over.

39:48.460 --> 39:52.280
All prisoners are to return to their cells immediately for a roll call.

39:57.890 --> 40:00.630
Shoot! I'm late!

40:09.550 --> 40:11.330
Don't blame me!

40:40.160 --> 40:42.200
I've gotten used to making Shadow Clones!

40:47.680 --> 40:50.020
I failed on the land route the previous time.

40:50.630 --> 40:52.630
Right. This time, I'll take the sea route!

40:53.550 --> 40:57.150
No matter how fast-moving the currents are, if I swim like my life depended on it, it'll work out somehow!

41:33.500 --> 41:35.330
You'll die if you jump from there.

41:36.890 --> 41:37.680
Who's that?!

41:41.240 --> 41:43.420
Why do you want to escape so much?

41:44.460 --> 41:45.330
You're...

41:47.240 --> 41:50.110
If you've realized you've already fallen into a deep pit.

41:50.590 --> 41:52.850
then you'll try not to make it even deeper.

41:53.890 --> 41:56.330
Because I want to prove my innocence!

41:57.110 --> 41:58.720
How do you intend to do that?

41:58.890 --> 41:59.550
Well!

42:00.200 --> 42:02.630
I don't know! But I'll find a way somehow!

42:03.370 --> 42:05.200
Even if you do manage to run away,

42:05.590 --> 42:07.330
you won't be able to prove anything.

42:07.890 --> 42:13.110
Shut up! I can't just sit here and wait for someone else to find the real culprit for me!

42:30.240 --> 42:31.110
Kage Bunshin...

42:31.980 --> 42:33.810
The current is too fast... I can't make my hand seals!

42:53.720 --> 42:57.590
Umm... Sorry... Thanks for saving me.

42:59.670 --> 43:03.880
The currents around this area suddenly become faster when you go further out

43:04.800 --> 43:08.270
If you'd been washed out there, I wouldn't have been able to rescue you.

43:10.010 --> 43:11.710
What're you staring at?

43:12.280 --> 43:13.400
Transvestite?

43:16.880 --> 43:17.670
Ow!

43:18.540 --> 43:19.840
Who're you calling a transvestite?!

43:20.580 --> 43:22.710
Eh? You're really a woman?

43:23.140 --> 43:26.710
Don't you dare tell anyone! I saved your life, okay?

43:27.450 --> 43:28.800
Don't forget that!

43:32.450 --> 43:35.800
Do you remember what I told you in front of the body examination room?

43:36.350 --> 43:37.130
Yeah...

43:38.630 --> 43:41.230
I said it as a warning for you to not do anything stupid.

43:41.710 --> 43:43.970
Looks like you didn't get it at all.

43:44.760 --> 43:47.020
You're always doing something reckless...

43:47.630 --> 43:49.500
And you call yourself shinobi?

43:49.630 --> 43:51.930
What about you?

43:52.500 --> 43:53.930
My name's Ryuuzetsu.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.710
An ANBU from Hidden Grass.

43:56.110 --> 43:59.890
I've been investigating about you, Uzumaki Naruto.

44:00.410 --> 44:03.450
I came to Houzuki Castle at this time because

44:03.630 --> 44:07.100
I received news that you've been thrown into prison here.

44:07.580 --> 44:09.100
Hidden Leaf ANBU?

44:09.630 --> 44:11.710
Whatfs your motive?

44:12.240 --> 44:13.930
I know who framed you.

44:14.970 --> 44:17.450
Really?! Who is it?!

44:18.190 --> 44:20.620
The owner of Houzuki Castle, Mui

44:22.620 --> 44:25.010
Mui is a Hidden Grass Jounin.

44:25.840 --> 44:28.140
For generations, his family has been Door Guards.

44:28.490 --> 44:31.840
As the words suggest, a Door Guard's duty is to protect a certain door.

44:32.450 --> 44:35.450
Inside that door, lies a certain box.

44:35.450 --> 44:36.020
A box?

44:36.810 --> 44:39.280
It goes by the name of Box of Extreme Bliss.

44:39.630 --> 44:42.760
Ifs said that whoever can open it will get their wish granted.

44:43.460 --> 44:45.370
A box that grants wishes?

44:45.590 --> 44:46.540
How's that possible?

44:47.420 --> 44:49.280
Nobody knows the truth.

44:49.760 --> 44:53.850
But apparently, during the Rikudo Sennin era, Hidden Grass Village opened that box

44:54.020 --> 44:56.890
and almost took over the world with it.

44:57.290 --> 44:59.590
Then, what happened?!

45:00.110 --> 45:01.280
Nobody knows.

45:01.850 --> 45:04.850
Ifs said that one day, Hidden Grass Village was suddenly destroyed.

45:05.460 --> 45:08.980
After that, two groups rose up in opposition to each other.

45:10.020 --> 45:13.980
The pro-war Grass Fruit group that hopes to revive the Hidden Grass and

45:14.290 --> 45:17.500
an anti-war group. Grass Flower, which I belong to.

45:18.290 --> 45:23.150
Mui belongs to the Fruit group, and they intend to use the box as a weapon.

45:26.110 --> 45:28.070
According to information we've gathered.

45:28.330 --> 45:31.110
a huge amount of chakra is needed to open that box.

45:32.590 --> 45:35.240
The Fruit group has definitely

45:35.460 --> 45:39.370
set their sights on your Jinchuuriki chakra Uzumaki Naruto.

45:40.590 --> 45:45.540
So I've been put here because of that Fruit group, right?

45:46.200 --> 45:50.500
My mission is to prevent them from opening that box by hook or by crook.

45:51.020 --> 45:54.370
Then you shouldn't have saved me!

45:54.720 --> 45:57.630
They won't be able to open the box for a while if I die.

45:58.020 --> 45:59.200
If I did that...

45:59.370 --> 46:02.890
If I let someone die in order to fulfill my own mission...

46:04.110 --> 46:07.020
I'd become just like him.

46:07.680 --> 46:08.460
Him?

46:09.760 --> 46:12.150
That man... Mui.

46:12.330 --> 46:14.940
He stopped at nothing to open that box.

46:15.460 --> 46:18.240
He even offered up the life of his own son.

47:15.720 --> 47:17.720
Not enough chakra?

47:35.630 --> 47:39.330
To complete my mission, I must kill Mui.

47:40.150 --> 47:41.500
I will kill Mui.

47:43.370 --> 47:46.200
Did something happen between you and that old guy?

47:47.110 --> 47:48.760
You don't have to know.

47:54.460 --> 47:56.500
Once Mui dies, the Tenrou seal will disappear.

47:57.110 --> 48:01.280
When that happens, I'd like you to use your powers to open the box and destroy it.

48:01.680 --> 48:04.850
There.s no way to lift this jutsu without killing Mui?

48:05.460 --> 48:08.330
But this seal is nothing!

48:08.680 --> 48:13.070
There's no need to kill Mui. I'll destroy that box by myself!

48:13.980 --> 48:15.110
Don't make it sound so easy

48:15.500 --> 48:17.370
There's nothing I can't do!

48:17.890 --> 48:20.110
Don't underestimate the great Uzumaki Naruto!

48:22.370 --> 48:26.590
Uzumaki Naruto. Come back to Houzuki Castle with me for now.

48:28.150 --> 48:30.150
All right! Let's do this!

48:37.810 --> 48:39.590
Katon, Onidourou! (Fire Style, Ogre Lantern Cage)

48:54.420 --> 48:55.980
Dam! Failed again.

48:57.150 --> 48:58.810
Don't rush it!

49:02.500 --> 49:04.280
Katon, Onidourou!

49:16.460 --> 49:17.890
Are you showing off?

49:18.590 --> 49:24.540
Must be good being a genius. You con do anything without practising!

49:25.020 --> 49:26.940
You're a genius too, Ryuuzetsu.

49:28.290 --> 49:30.110
Youimean my bloodline?

49:30.720 --> 49:33.720
Yeah. The Ryuumei Tensei (Dragon Life Incarnation) is a fantastic skill, you know?

49:34.420 --> 49:37.020
You can only use that skill once, because after that, you end up dead!

49:37.110 --> 49:38.540
That's not even funny

49:58.630 --> 49:59.940
What's wrong, Muku?

50:01.500 --> 50:02.280
It's tomorrow.

50:03.150 --> 50:04.460
Oh, I see!

50:05.150 --> 50:06.070
Finally, huh?

50:07.290 --> 50:07.720
Yeah.

50:08.290 --> 50:09.760
I'm so envious of you, Muku.

50:10.420 --> 50:11.980
You just laze around and stare into space all day.

50:12.240 --> 50:15.460
but everyone clamors about how you're a genius not seen since the Hidden Grass started!

50:15.890 --> 50:18.890
And now, you're going to become the village's hero!

50:20.290 --> 50:23.150
I may not be able to come back.

50:24.500 --> 50:25.410
Are you afraid?

50:25.680 --> 50:27.110
Because...

50:27.330 --> 50:28.940
I just...

50:32.550 --> 50:33.940
Hey, Ryuuzetsu.

50:34.370 --> 50:38.200
Do you think it's right for us to open a box like that?

50:38.420 --> 50:39.720
Of course!

50:40.150 --> 50:42.280
Because ifs for the village, right?

50:43.550 --> 50:45.330
Ifs not that I'm afraid to die!

50:46.290 --> 50:47.680
I don't know how to put it...

50:48.550 --> 50:51.810
Sometimes I just feel like... I'm going to lose sight of myself...

50:54.020 --> 50:55.460
You're not going to die!

50:56.420 --> 50:57.760
Promise me, Muku!

50:58.020 --> 50:59.940
That you'll come back safe and sound!

51:03.460 --> 51:04.460
Promise me!

51:08.070 --> 51:11.460
Okay... I got it. I promise.

51:19.150 --> 51:21.200
Now I understand, Muku.

51:32.150 --> 51:34.980
That box shouldn't be opened!

51:42.590 --> 51:45.590
What is your village to you?

51:46.290 --> 51:51.810
Have you ever killed someone you had no resentment for, just to protect your village?

52:35.070 --> 52:36.850
I will kill Mui.

52:52.370 --> 52:53.710
Are you a fool?

52:54.240 --> 52:56.450
You'll be put in the punishment room again.

52:56.800 --> 52:58.240
I understand now.

52:58.580 --> 53:00.890
You were the one who set me up, right?!

53:08.930 --> 53:10.280
Is he an idiot?!

53:12.890 --> 53:13.710
Why you...

53:13.850 --> 53:15.710
Hidden Grass Style, Happashou!

53:23.710 --> 53:25.710
This should make you give up.

53:26.710 --> 53:31.020
What is my village to me?

53:31.500 --> 53:36.760
I thought about it seriously, but the only things that came to mind were some mundane stuff.

53:37.760 --> 53:42.320
The ramen shop... My dirty-minded master...

53:43.020 --> 53:47.410
To other people, these may be just pointless memories, but...

53:50.150 --> 53:54.280
According to Houzuki Castle's Penalty Article 23 Clause 6,

53:54.710 --> 53:56.580
your third time in the room will be one week.

53:57.060 --> 54:01.450
Why don't I make a nameplate for you and put it on the door?

54:07.060 --> 54:07.930
Please hurry.

54:12.450 --> 54:13.500
This is the key.

54:17.060 --> 54:18.670
I can't wait any longer.

54:19.280 --> 54:21.800
If I kill Mui, the box won't be opened!

54:38.710 --> 54:42.800
I see. So you're the Flower group's assassin!

54:51.110 --> 54:52.580
Mui's not here

54:53.020 --> 54:56.240
Don't know what's up, but apparently he's got to run some errand or something.

55:01.020 --> 55:02.370
My mission is over.

55:02.850 --> 55:05.970
You'll let me see my son as promised, won't you?

55:06.710 --> 55:09.890
The weakness of Hundred Transformations Kazan is his only son...

55:10.370 --> 55:12.710
Why don't you transform back already?

55:18.370 --> 55:22.500
As per your instructions, I've transformed into that kid and gone around killing people.

55:23.280 --> 55:25.150
You'll keep your promise, won't you?

55:25.890 --> 55:27.890
Of course we will.

55:30.150 --> 55:33.020
As soon as you die.

55:46.320 --> 55:47.840
Can't move my body...

55:54.020 --> 55:55.370
You can't move.

55:55.540 --> 55:59.280
There's no one in this world who can hold a candle to us in restraining jutsu.

55:59.850 --> 56:03.150
We will let you see your son, as promised.

56:03.500 --> 56:04.970
In the afterlife.

56:05.150 --> 56:06.370
Dammit!

56:17.580 --> 56:19.410
He didn't even last a single strike!

56:19.580 --> 56:21.240
Bless his soul.

56:22.580 --> 56:25.580
Oh, Mui! Now we can rest assured.

56:39.890 --> 56:41.370
Why did you let me go?

56:41.710 --> 56:44.370
Your mission is to assassinate Mui?

56:45.540 --> 56:50.150
Which means the legend of the Box of Extreme Bliss is true, then?

56:51.280 --> 56:54.280
I won't let you guys use the box to do as you please!

56:54.930 --> 56:56.970
I don't care about that.

56:57.190 --> 57:00.020
I only want to live a quiet, peaceful life.

57:01.020 --> 57:03.370
I can't escape as long as I'm sealed by Tenrou.

57:04.320 --> 57:08.500
Which means life'll be easier for me if I stuck to Mui.

57:09.450 --> 57:11.100
What's your point?!

57:11.450 --> 57:13.100
You still don't get it?

57:13.780 --> 57:16.130
Once Mui dies, I'll be able to escape from this place,

57:16.390 --> 57:18.610
and your mission will be complete.

57:18.830 --> 57:23.040
And that means we're not enemies.

57:23.780 --> 57:25.300
What are you planning?

57:26.260 --> 57:28.260
I'm going to set up the stage.

57:28.910 --> 57:31.040
Why should I believe you?

57:31.650 --> 57:36.220
Why do you think the Hidden Grass built the Houzuki Castle here, of all places?

57:37.390 --> 57:39.910
One reason is to hide the Box of Extreme Bliss.

57:40.390 --> 57:45.780
Secondly, so that they can research on how to open the box by using the prisoners.

57:47.740 --> 57:51.000
After all, those who have been sent here are as good as dead.

57:51.960 --> 57:55.520
I don't know when I'll end up as a mummy after being sucked dry of chakra,\either.

57:56.180 --> 57:59.040
I may not look it, but I'm actually pretty desperate too.

57:59.350 --> 58:00.780
Who are you?

58:01.000 --> 58:02.830
Why do you know so much?!

58:03.050 --> 58:05.480
Just a lackey of Mui's.

58:05.650 --> 58:06.780
So, what will you do?

58:07.610 --> 58:09.610
Wanna try staking on me?

58:37.740 --> 58:39.570
Uzumaki Naruto! Come out!

58:43.350 --> 58:44.520
Hurry up

59:11.910 --> 59:13.960
How dare Mui make us wait so long.

59:14.350 --> 59:17.350
Mui is a man who even offered up his son for the village.

59:17.650 --> 59:19.350
There won't be any problems.

59:20.220 --> 59:21.650
It's almost done.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.090
This time, the world will belong to the Hidden Grass... no...

59:24.390 --> 59:27.570
It will become the footstool of the four of us!

59:35.780 --> 59:38.780
Ifs not that I believe that Maroi guy,

59:39.440 --> 59:41.350
but he's our only chance now.

59:41.650 --> 59:45.220
The Box of Extreme Bliss can grant any wish, right?

59:45.650 --> 59:49.130
Then why isn't the Grass Flower group keen on using it?

59:49.780 --> 59:53.130
If used correctly, it can bring peace to the world, right?

59:54.090 --> 59:55.740
It's too risky.

59:56.440 --> 01:00:01.090
That thing makes people think war is all right as long as it brings peace.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.610
A thing like that shouldn't exist in this world!

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:10.570
Can I ask you something?

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:11.870
What is it?

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:15.870
How are you related to Mui's son?

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:17.570
Why do you ask?

01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:22.830
Because you looked kinda desperate when you were talking about him.

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:25.170
His name was Muku.

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:28.910
My best friend.

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:32.090
I see.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.780
That's all I need to know.

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:39.910
I can trust you.

01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:43.090
Aren't you afraid of the Tenrou?.

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:45.390
Course I am!

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.700
But I'm even more afraid of losing myself!

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:55.480
Sometimes I just feel like... I'm going to lose sight of myself...

01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:59.780
I got it.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.830
What the heck are you doing?!

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:17.700
What was that for, hey?!

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:25.390
Don't just stand there like an idiot, blockhead!

01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:28.570
You trying to pick a fight, brat?!

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:30.830
Hold it right there!

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.130
You're not getting away

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:35.300
Come and get me if you can! I'll take you all on!

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:37.390
Hey, there's a fight going on!

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:41.960
Ooh, they're going strong!

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.740
So it's started?

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.390
Sorry! Didn't do it on purpose...

01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:06.090
Looks like your blood's boiling too, eh?!

01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:13.350
What are you doing?

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.040
It wasn't on purpose

01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:21.300
Sheesh, I can't even eat a meal in peace.

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:25.780
Yo, yo! What's going on, yo?

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:30.040
My radio!

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.780
Shut up

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:33.260
My corn soup

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.220
What? A riot?!

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:39.780
Hurry up and stop them!

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:41.440
Stop!!

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:49.570
Mui-sama!

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.220
Please use Tenrou to suppress the riot!

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:56.350
Ifs just a minor scuffle! Figure a way out yourself!

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.040
Yes, sir!

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.780
Stupid old man!

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.170
Come on and get me, greenhorns!

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.650
While Ryuuzetsu's drawing Mui's attention away,

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:41.520
I have to find the door that leads to the box.

01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:47.650
Let me see... The third blue book in the center shelf, I think?

01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:21.910
So that funny box that can grant any wish is inside, huh?

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.650
If I'm not wrong,

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:32.780
we should be able to break the Tenrou seal without killing that old guy

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:52.340
You're... not Mui!

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:54.680
Stop!

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.050
Dammit!

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:13.050
We've finally captured the Jinchuuriki!

01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:33.050
Are you stupid?

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.750
I'll remove the Tenrou first.

01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.750
Unseal!

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:06.450
I need to concentrate.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.490
May I request for you to leave me alone?

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.790
Raiton, Denkou Noroshi! (Lightning Style, Signal Fire)

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:49.400
Just a bit more...

01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:29.100
Such immense chakra...

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:32.710
The Jinchuuriki is indeed impressive.

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:39.230
You bastard... So I heard you even gave your son to that box, huh?

01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:43.660
Do you really want to open that thing so much?

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.450
It is all for the future of the Hidden Grass Village.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.790
Don't use the future as an excuse!

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:54.660
Some guy who can't even protect the little things before him at present

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.100
is not fit to talk about the future!

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.620
I once asked if you

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:05.100
have ever killed someone innocent for your village.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.360
And my answer was,

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.530
Don't make me laugh!

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.050
I feel the same way.

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:26.920
I feel the same way you do!

01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:44.100
That's why I had to open this box!!

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:10.229
Dammit! Not enough chakra!

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.310
Katon, Tenrou!

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.359
Dammit! Not again...

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:15.450
Whoa... so the Box of Extreme Bliss is the door itself?

01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:19.140
How majestic.

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:21.360
Now our wish will come true.

01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:23.180
Where is Mui?!

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.450
Get him here quickly!

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:28.310
The Box will grant the wish of its Door Guard!

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:33.530
There he is! Hurry up and wish for the revival of the Hidden Grass!

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.790
Surely your deceased son wanted the same as well!

01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:53.970
Ðž Box... open hence!

01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.790
Ðž Box of Extreme Bliss!

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.710
I make a wish for my son...

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.790
Please let me see Muku!

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:23.660
Box of Extreme Bliss! Please grant me my wish!

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:26.750
What!

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.530
Have you gone crazy, Mui?!

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:33.270
In my heart, the Hidden Grass Village has long been dead!

01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:37.360
That's right... ever since that day 10 years ago... when I lost Muku!

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.010
What?!

01:11:57.790 --> 01:12:01.010
I don't remember asking for your help!

01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:05.620
Shut up! I was actually gonna kill you

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:08.750
You're...

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.840
Hundred Transformations Kazan!

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.750
We should've killed you that night!

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.140
Why?

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.360
Just a passing whim.

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:47.270
Once everything is over, I'll gladly hand myself over to you.

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.790
Dammit, Mui...

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:56.920
If it wasn't for you both my son and I would've been done for.

01:12:57.490 --> 01:13:01.180
How dare you lot make a mockery of Hundred Transformations Kazan!

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.790
Mui... How dare you betray us!

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.050
haven't you?

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.050
You've been wanting to resurrect your son right from the start,

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.310
I won't let you lot off!

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.790
Muku...

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:36.740
Father...

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:42.610
Muku... Sorry...

01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:44.870
I was wrong.

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.960
Mui!

01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:27.220
Yes. You were wrong.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.920
You shouldn't have let me out of the box?

01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:41.610
What the heck do you think you're doing?!

01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:44.790
Old guy Mui was just...

01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:50.350
Muku!

01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:55.440
Why, Muku?

01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:01.610
That's...

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:05.570
That's not like you at all!

01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:09.270
Ryuuzetsu...

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:12.400
You mustn't lose sight of your true self.

01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:17.220
Remember what you were like before you were taken by the box!

01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:25.180
Muku!

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.610
What's this...

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.540
I can feel an unpleasant chakra...

01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:56.670
That's...

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:08.370
Don't come here!

01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:20.580
That's not the guy you knew anymore.

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.540
I'm the one who has no right to be shinobi...

01:17:26.890 --> 01:17:28.710
This is no time to be crying

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:47.710
So this is the Sennin mode?

01:17:47.890 --> 01:17:51.580
He put his clone somewhere to store up natural energy, huh?

01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:52.800
Natural?

01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:56.280
Natural energy is something you get from outside.

01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:00.580
Tenrou restricts chakra within one's body, so it doesn't work on that!

01:18:03.190 --> 01:18:04.580
What are you going to do?

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:09.320
He might regain his senses if I destroyed that box

01:18:10.410 --> 01:18:14.450
Senpou, Oodamo Rasengan (Immortal its, Big Spiral Ball)

01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:28.150
It didn't work..

01:18:29.190 --> 01:18:30.280
That can't be..

01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:32.150
If s useless.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.410
I've tried for countless times inside, but this box can't be destroyed.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.500
Why did you kill old man Mui?

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:46.450
You want me to be grateful to a father who sent his son into the box?

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:51.970
Old guy Mui may have made a wrong choice,

01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:54.840
but he's been trying to save you all this time!

01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:58.930
He did everything for you, even if he had to go against the whole world!

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:12.060
If s useless. Your attacks won't be able to reach me.

01:19:12.450 --> 01:19:14.760
I Why can't I hit something as big as that?

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.280
Gotta use monsters to deal with monsters!

01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:19.840
Kuchi Yose no Jutsu! (Summoning Art)

01:19:22.450 --> 01:19:24.580
Who're you calling a monster?!

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.670
Ah, sorry, slip of tongue...

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:29.800
And what's with this tiny...

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:33.560
What the?! Naruto!

01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:36.700
What is the Box of Extreme Bliss doing here?!

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.520
You know about it, boss?

01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:40.170
Of course I do!

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.910
That was an ultimate weapon during the era of the Rikudo Sennin!

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:50.300
Isn't that Satori?

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.390
Satori?

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.650
That's his name?

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:02.480
The Box of Extreme Bliss brings forth Satori (enlightenment), actuates Satori, and ends in Satori.

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:09.300
That guy is a puppet of that box that captures enemies and throws them into the box.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.610
And he can read hearts.

01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:16.700
I don't know how the Box of Extreme Bliss came into existence, but

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.430
it can make comrades out of enemies that have been thrown inside.

01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:26.430
Let's go, Naruto!

01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:27.430
Yeah!

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.300
Boss! Where're you going?

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:43.650
Running away?!

01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:46.480
That was my intention from the start.

01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:51.780
And I mode use of your fighting spirit to not let him read my intentions!

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:57.040
There's no way you can win that freak face-on, anyway!

01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:00.960
Is someone controlling Satori?

01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:01.740
No.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.260
That means Satori's gone berserk.

01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:10.090
Once he sucks everyone into the box, he'll start sucking everything else.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.390
That's how whole countries have been wiped out in the past...

01:21:13.650 --> 01:21:15.480
What should we do then?

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:19.910
Humans swallowed by Satori won't be able to return to normal again.

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:25.350
We can only either stuff him back into the box, or kill him.

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:46.610
Dammit! Wasn't it a box that could grant any wishes!

01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:48.830
Something like that doesn't exist, moron!

01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.300
What's your wish?

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:56.040
Peace? Money? Or the world?

01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:01.960
Whatever you wish for, it's something you have to get by your own strength!

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:07.610
The only things coming out of that box is evil power.

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:11.390
But old guy Mui was just trying to save his son!

01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:14.300
You humans can be so optimistic.

01:22:14.610 --> 01:22:19.700
Put an apple in that box, and the only thing you'll get back is a rotten apple!

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:21.130
He's coming

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.870
Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!

01:23:01.170 --> 01:23:02.560
Bastard!

01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:11.870
Dammit! Can't hit him at all!

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.300
Is there no other way, boss?

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:17.870
I already said he can read your mind, didn't I?

01:23:18.650 --> 01:23:21.740
The only way is not think of anything.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.090
Not think of anything?

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.390
Here he comes.

01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:50.260
Oh boy. Not quiet and peaceful at all.

01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:52.700
Whoa! This is not funny!!!

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:55.170
Boss!

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.430
Boss, are you okay? A

01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:23.740
He's completely reading all my moves.

01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:32.870
Are you afraid?

01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:39.170
You may have mastered Senjutsu, but you've yet to free yourself from fear.

01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:45.650
Don't listen to him, Naruto!

01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:47.700
I know!

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.350
Naruto!

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.040
Dammit... at a time like this...

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.960
Die!!!

01:25:07.650 --> 01:25:09.300
I won't make it!

01:25:11.610 --> 01:25:12.610
Boss!

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.430
Damn!

01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.740
Dangerous box.

01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:35.650
Open it and you get the chops.

01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:40.390
Hurry up and move away or you won't live to see another day!

01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:45.910
Old man Octo!

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:50.090
Coz the Bee is accompanying this boy! Yeah!

01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:55.220
Yeah, believe it.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.480
Naruto!

01:25:59.310 --> 01:26:00.090
Guys!

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.090
Granny Tsunade too!

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.350
What's everyone doing here?

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:10.910
This was your mission, Naruto.

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.910
Nobody suspected you from the start!

01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:30.220
Sorry for the anxiety.

01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:45.260
If we'd told you the truth, you would've gone on a rampage, right?

01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:48.780
Oh, Bee-san! Thank goodness you made it in time!

01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:55.740
My mission was to gather information about the Box of Extreme Bliss and steal it when the chance arises.

01:26:56.310 --> 01:27:00.350
And also, I was asked by Bee-san to protect you

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:01.300
What?

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.740
You don't get it?

01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:07.430
I'm just a nameless little fly.

01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:09.610
That voice...

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:14.300
Just defeat Mui, and the seal on your chest will disappear.

01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:18.350
I've heard about your personality from Bee-san.

01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:21.780
I thought you'd stir up a ruckus if I told you that.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:24.260
And if you did, you'd be thrown into the punishment room.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.650
There's no place safer than that room here!

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:32.960
Huh? Then why did you kidnap me on the first night?

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:39.000
Well, I thought, we have to get that door open first, so... Really, really!

01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:43.260
Of course, I fully intended to rescue you once the door was opened! Yeah!

01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:45.090
How?

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:50.610
Whatever! You're safe and that's all that matter.

01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:54.430
We'd better take care of that monster first. Here it comes!

01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:59.520
He was totally gonna leave me in the lurch.

01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:07.050
Dunno what's going on,

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.180
dude you're totally impossible!

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:14.960
I'll be the one to take out that terrible box!

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.480
And I'll be the one to take you out as well!

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.570
I see!

01:28:27.090 --> 01:28:29.090
This is gonna be hard!

01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:34.570
He dodged everything.

01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:36.960
He can read hearts.

01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:39.570
Dammit... And he's still so relaxed!

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.740
Stop it already, Muku!

01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:53.830
He couldn't tell that Ryuuzetsu was going to run to him.

01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:55.440
Why?

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:59.000
Why is Ryuuzetsu the only one...

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:04.000
It's all or nothing!

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.310
I'm going to enter Sennin mode again.

01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:09.530
Guys, buy me some time!

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:20.830
Naruto won't be able to move for a while until he enters Sennin mode.

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:23.700
Let's protect Naruto together!

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.180
Son of a gun

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:12.960
Run!

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.260
Don't push me, idiot!

01:30:35.050 --> 01:30:36.390
Back to the castle!

01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:50.130
Neji!

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:52.530
Kaiten!

01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:04.920
Nikudan Hari Sensha! (Meat Porcupine Tank)

01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:15.740
You done yet, datteba-boy?

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:22.660
That's not Muku...

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:27.530
It's not Muku...

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:30.440
Don't be deceived...

01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:33.310
That's not Muku...

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:45.790
The Hidden Crass will clean up its own mess!

01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:57.090
Katon... Onidourou!

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.830
Suiton, Teppougyo! (Water Style, Archerfish)

01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.740
Don't be stupid! You still have Tenrou on you!

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.310
Stop... Muku!

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.920
I'm not fighting alone.

01:32:26.050 --> 01:32:27.260
I'm not fighting alone.

01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:32.310
Everyone in the village is with me.

01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:14.130
Here I go

01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:28.830
Why is he suddenly able to hit that thing?

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:32.570
I can't feel any killing intent from that kid at all.

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.790
What's going on? A

01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:56.310
Can you imagine what if s like in this box?

01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.610
There's no exit and you can't destroy the box itself.

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:04.310
In complete darkness, only one emotion exists within.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.130
If s pitch-dark and heavy, seeping into every last cell of yours.

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:14.660
That was the emotion that honed me.

01:34:15.090 --> 01:34:18.740
All emotions that gave me grief become ambiguous.

01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:23.000
And when I killed my father, it completely disappeared.

01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:26.440
Nothing's holding me back anymore,

01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:28.390
and that feels great...

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.740
Feels great?

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:33.260
I can only feel fear now.

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.530
Fear of coming out of the box.

01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:38.740
Fear towards those who wish to attack me.

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:42.000
I can't read hearts.

01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:45.960
But my body automatically responds to the feeling of fear, that's all.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:47.870
So I can understand very well that

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.870
right now, you have no fear

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.740
So that's what you gained after killing your father?

01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:58.870
Father bestowed true strength upon me wit "This death.

01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.960
True strength that has no hesitation.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:11.220
What old man Mui was trying to give you...

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:14.530
wasn't that showy and pretentious kind of strength!

01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:18.440
Do your eyes no longer reflect pain?

01:35:19.050 --> 01:35:23.570
Can your ears no longer hear the voice of someone calling your name?

01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:27.870
Do you no longer have that feeling of wanting to protect someone in your heart?!

01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:32.350
How about the taste of the ramen that comforted you when you were sack!

01:35:36.610 --> 01:35:38.180
You still don't get it?

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.830
Even though we're being bound and made use of by the village with

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
those meaningless emotions?

01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:53.130
Cut off all your ties, and you'll be able to climb to my height.

01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:55.000
Kage Bunshin no Jutsu.

01:35:56.610 --> 01:35:58.960
You're the one who doesn't get it.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:03.570
You won't get stronger no matter how many ties you cut.

01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:06.440
Only by pursuing for more ties

01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:10.570
and protecting those ties do you truly gain strength.

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:13.050
Just like your father!

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:20.180
That just sounds like a trivial excuse by trivial humans.

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:24.000
That's enough, Muku!

01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:26.610
How can you say such horrible things?

01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:28.440
Wake up already!

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:30.570
Hey!

01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:31.870
Ryuuzetsu!

01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:39.610
Muku... your father has never once betrayed you before!

01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:44.220
Come back here! Have you forgotten your promise to me?!

01:36:59.090 --> 01:37:00.530
Oodamo Rasengan!

01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:21.960
Ryuuzetsu...

01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:29.830
That's enough of you...

01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:31.000
What?..

01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:35.440
You couldn't read Ryuuzetsu's movements just now because

01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:40.390
there wasn't a single shred of fear in her heart at all!

01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:53.000
Tenrou isn't actually an imprisonment jutsu, right?

01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:57.350
Since we can't use chakra, nobody tries to go around causing trouble.

01:37:57.870 --> 01:38:02.830
Were not those hands of yours made to put a stop to wars?

01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:10.480
I know Satori can't go back to being human.

01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:17.310
If you feel the same as me, you should know what I'm thing right now!

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:25.440
What are you talking about?

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.870
I wasn't talking to you

01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:34.000
Dammit...

01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:38.050
Pull yourself together, old man Mui!

01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:04.610
A son always looks straight ahead at his old guy's back!

01:39:15.610 --> 01:39:20.740
Since Tenrou's still working, it means old man Mui's still alive as well!

01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:27.260
At least let us die together, Muku!

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.700
That's the least bit of atonement I can make!

01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:10.050
Katon, Gouko Tenrou! (Fire Style, Great Fire Sky Prison)

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:55.960
Let's go

01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:00.790
Get away from him, old man.Mui!

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.660
Fuuton, Rosen Shuriken! (Wind Style, Spiral Shuriken)

01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:53.260
Father...

01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:08.530
Muku!

01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:11.310
Ryuuzetsu...

01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:20.920
Father's hands... are really so big...

01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:25.480
Oh, Muku...

01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:49.000
Katon, Onidourou!

01:42:58.830 --> 01:43:03.740
Sorry I couldn't keep my promise to you, Ryuuzetsu.

01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:11.530
This time, with Father and you... we'll truly live here peacefully together..

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.220
Hey, the Tenrou's gone!

01:44:06.050 --> 01:44:08.480
The seal's gone! Let's run!

01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:10.830
Don't let anyone escape!

01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:19.440
Chouji!

01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:25.700
Give me food!

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:33.130
Son of a gun!

01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:38.130
Tonight we're gonna be hard rock!

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:41.440
And this guy will have a head lock!

01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:45.830
I guess no one was able to make it so far, huh.

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:37.000
This is...

01:45:53.530 --> 01:45:57.790
Such a gentle warmth...

01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:09.000
Promise me!

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.440
Okay... I got it. I promise.

01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:15.220
Definitely, all right?

01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:17.480
I'll definitely come back.

01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:29.740
I just wish I can live peacefully, Ryuuzetsu.

01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:34.740
Here, with Father, and...

01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:40.610
Huh? What did you just say?

01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:09.390
That took quite a while.

01:47:12.610 --> 01:47:14.790
Welcome back, Muku.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:23.050
He's getting weaker Naruto! Pull yourself together, Naruto!

01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:25.570
Don't lose to something like this!

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:27.740
Out of the way, Sakura. I'll do it.

01:47:27.870 --> 01:47:28.870
But...

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.260
The wound is too deep... If s already too late...

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:59.000
I am Ryuuzetsu, sharer of life.

01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:08.960
Uzumaki Naruto. At least be the one to live on.

01:48:10.570 --> 01:48:15.570
The ultimate skill of my clan, Ryuumei Tensei.

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:30.000
Muku, this child reminds me of you back then.

01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:34.870
So laughably tiny, and yet so surprisingly huge.

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:42.610
I have a feeling he would be able to protect what we've been trying to protect.

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:50.480
I'm so glad I got to meet you in the end.

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:55.480
At the very least, right now, I can become your road lamp.

01:48:56.310 --> 01:49:00.310
Naruto, you're going to become the road lamp guiding others from now on

01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:03.440
So that no one ever loses their way.

01:49:04.050 --> 01:49:07.740
So that no one ever becomes sad.

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:11.660
His pulse has returned.

01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:15.570
What about her?

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.570
Sakura-chan...

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:25.440
Granny Tsunade...

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.660
Don't say anything

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.530
Wait till you're fully recovered first.

01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:36.830
A voice... Ryuuzetsu's calling for me...

01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:39.130
Naruto...

01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:46.440
I was in a very dork place Cold, felt unsure...

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.920
Has Muku been staying in a place like that all the time?

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:55.870
All by himself inside that box...

01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:57.660
Enough, Naruto. A

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.920
Couldn't find on exit at all...

01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:04.260
Then I heard Ryuuzetsu's voice...

01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:07.530
Granny Tsunade, where's Ryuuzetsu?

01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:20.440
Leave the troublesome stuff for later!

01:50:20.570 --> 01:50:22.310
Leave it for after you recover!

01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:26.180
Or I'm gonna ignore you, you jerk!

01:50:26.530 --> 01:50:27.440
Yeah...

01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:29.530
Mui "Ryuuzetsu"

01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:30.700
Mui old man.

01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:34.660
To me, my village is...

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:41.010
Well, I think it's probably a place I can be myself without thinking too much.

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:49.140
I won't give up.

01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:54.180
I may be small, but I'll become a man able to protect what's important to everyone.

01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:59.660
That's what being a guide means, right?

01:54:59.790 --> 01:55:00.750
Ryuuzetsu?

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:06.140
Take him away!

01:55:06.570 --> 01:55:09.400
I haven't done anything!!

01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:18.270
D-Did I seem unnatural or anything?

01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:20.830
You're such a meanie, Tsunade-sama.

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:27.310
Keeping a watch on Naruto round the clock when you received the drawings...

01:55:28.570 --> 01:55:33.880
You're the one-who said we should pretend to play into the enemy's trap, Kakashi.

01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:35.810
