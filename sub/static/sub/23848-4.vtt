00:17.280 --> 00:18.800
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:21.440 --> 00:23.320
What happened? Can you hear me?

00:24.040 --> 00:25.040
I'll get help.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.400
Please.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.320
-Twelve transcripts...
-Me!

00:29.600 --> 00:31.160
-Her with the green hat, please.
-You.

00:32.760 --> 00:34.920
<i>Look at the tramp.</i>
<i>Always a tenner in her pocket.</i>

00:35.000 --> 00:36.720
-Come on, say it again.
-Lotte!

00:36.800 --> 00:39.080
You're on the game
but go all sensitive on me?

00:40.680 --> 00:43.080
<i>There is lots of trouble</i>
<i>awaiting us on May First.</i>

00:43.160 --> 00:45.480
It is our duty

00:45.560 --> 00:47.600
to build a bulwark against anarchy.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.280
The train crossed the border this morning.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.120
It's coming straight to Berlin!

01:01.520 --> 01:02.800
WAYBILL

01:02.880 --> 01:04.360
You were wonderful, ma chère.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.920
Give me the papers.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.600
I'll kill you.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.640
Arrest him!

01:10.800 --> 01:11.960
What's on that train?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.320
What's in this wagon, tell us.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.800
It's the Sorokin's gold.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.200
<i>The city of Berlin</i>

01:35.280 --> 01:38.040
<i>Has been sung about before</i>

01:38.120 --> 01:41.920
<i>By people who've long been buried</i>
<i>under the green grass</i>

01:42.880 --> 01:47.040
<i>To us, they're but memories now</i>

01:47.160 --> 01:51.680
<i>As if mother read fairy tales to us</i>

01:52.400 --> 01:53.880
<i>Some love it</i>

01:53.960 --> 01:56.040
<i>Others slag it off</i>

01:56.680 --> 01:57.800
<i>Some things are gone</i>

01:57.880 --> 02:00.400
<i>Which once created a stir</i>

02:01.040 --> 02:03.800
<i>But some things today</i>

02:03.880 --> 02:04.960
<i>Are the same as yesterday</i>

02:06.280 --> 02:08.040
<i>This is Berlin</i>

02:08.120 --> 02:11.240
<i>The way it cries and laughs</i>

02:19.080 --> 02:20.800
<i>This is Berlin</i>

02:21.360 --> 02:24.920
<i>The way it cries and laughs</i>

KARSTADT HERMANNPLATZ

03:42.800 --> 03:48.120
Come out for May the First!
International solidarity!

03:48.520 --> 03:51.600
International solidarity...

03:55.120 --> 03:56.960
Free the people!

03:57.080 --> 03:58.640
Free the people...

04:00.160 --> 04:01.600
We have rights!

04:02.320 --> 04:03.680
Let us pass!

04:05.760 --> 04:06.600
Let us pass!

04:07.120 --> 04:09.760
Berlin stays red! Berlin stays red...

04:20.680 --> 04:22.560
What is it? Afraid?

04:24.400 --> 04:26.120
You stay here.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.240
Attention.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.520
Berlin stays red! Berlin stays red!

05:05.160 --> 05:06.000
Freeze!

05:20.720 --> 05:23.640
Holy cow. Did you want to muscle in?

05:25.120 --> 05:27.960
I'm afraid we have to go. Duty calls.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.240
Right, ladies.

05:29.320 --> 05:34.160
We're searching the SO36 area,
segment two, for illegal firearms.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.400
-Let's do it.
-Yes, sir. Let's go!

05:49.240 --> 05:50.480
Get back in the flat!

05:52.680 --> 05:53.800
Right, comrades. Roundup.

05:55.800 --> 05:56.640
House search.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.800
Get out of the way.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.000
Get out.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.040
-Come with us.
-What is is?

06:07.120 --> 06:08.680
-Shut up!
-What do you want from me?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.040
SEARCH WARRANT

06:14.120 --> 06:15.800
-Do you live alone?
-Yes.

06:15.880 --> 06:19.120
-When were you born?
-In 1837.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.880
Up, up. I'll take the fourth floor.

06:31.040 --> 06:35.680
Thirty-two flats,
and only one single 18th century musket.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.080
That's a bit poor for a red capital.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.760
They all knew we were coming.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.680
Yes, of course. The question is, how.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.680
Get out of here.
They're already on Weserstrasse.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.680
They'll shoot!

06:48.760 --> 06:50.040
Take cover!

06:50.360 --> 06:52.080
They're shooting everyone! Come on!

06:52.560 --> 06:54.840
Holy smoke.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.840
Go, go!

07:14.880 --> 07:16.040
They're with us!

07:16.120 --> 07:17.480
Get down, they're shooting!

07:17.560 --> 07:18.720
Get down!

07:20.200 --> 07:22.080
And they shoot, just like this?

07:22.520 --> 07:24.720
How would they know we're not reds?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.880
Hermann! Hermann!

07:37.600 --> 07:39.720
Go inside! Go inside!

07:41.320 --> 07:42.160
Go inside!

07:43.240 --> 07:44.240
Help!

07:45.520 --> 07:47.080
Hermann! Help!

07:48.560 --> 07:49.760
Hermann!

07:50.560 --> 07:51.720
Hurry up, boy!

07:57.000 --> 08:00.200
Good lord, they are spoiling for a fight.

08:00.760 --> 08:01.920
Help!

08:02.000 --> 08:03.400
We need help!

08:04.440 --> 08:05.320
Here!

08:07.560 --> 08:09.320
Come in here!

08:10.920 --> 08:12.000
Help!

08:19.160 --> 08:20.120
Anni.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.560
I have to... right now...

08:28.920 --> 08:30.240
Get some towels, quick.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.600
Calm down.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.680
Breathe calmly. Look at me.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.320
Yes, that's good.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.840
Very good. Good.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.160
You're beautiful.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.560
You too. You're very beautiful.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.800
You're shaking.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.560
I'm cold, too.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.440
Stay here.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.600
Stay here! Don't let go.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.760
Shit.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.600
Is there a doctor around?

09:15.080 --> 09:16.760
Number 61, across the street.

09:23.560 --> 09:26.520
Take cover, get down!
They're shooting everywhere!

09:30.560 --> 09:32.560
Let me out. Let me out now!

09:32.960 --> 09:35.920
I was hit! No! No!

09:38.520 --> 09:39.680
Come in here!

09:40.240 --> 09:43.000
What kind of dirty bastards are you?

09:48.120 --> 09:51.320
In here, come on! Quick! Run!

10:03.480 --> 10:04.680
Come on, girl.

10:05.720 --> 10:06.880
It's spring.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.960
You can't give up now.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.640
You'll want to go out into the warm air,
right?

10:15.320 --> 10:19.160
The pretty boy
will be back with a doctor.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.600
And in three weeks' time
you'll see each other.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.600
You'll go dancing.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.200
At the blossom festival in Werder.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.120
There's a woman bleeding out
across the street.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.320
At number 71. Bullets lodged in her back.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.280
Therese, you carry on.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.840
A sad occasion, doctor.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.520
It's never been very nice to see you.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.000
Doctor, I'm glad you're here.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.320
You found just the right one.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.960
-Why?
-What happened?

11:21.200 --> 11:25.360
Doctor for the poor. Member of the KP,
council member for Kreuzberg.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.880
They were shot down like sparrows.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.960
By whom? The police?

11:30.040 --> 11:33.520
-Hang on, comrade. Nobody saw that.
-How would you know?

11:33.720 --> 11:36.120
We were there.
We were nearly killed ourselves.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.240
But you weren't.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.200
We wouldn't shoot innocent women
off balconies.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.040
The blood is not even dry yet
and you're already covering it up.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.320
Covering it up?

11:44.840 --> 11:47.320
What are you doing here?
You're a vice copper.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.480
You're a police officer?

11:57.760 --> 11:58.760
Doris.

12:00.560 --> 12:01.680
A refill.

12:02.160 --> 12:05.160
-Good God, what a load.
-Indeed.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.800
We're sitting in a gold mine.

12:08.920 --> 12:09.840
How long was it?

12:10.240 --> 12:12.880
Eleven hours this time. That's 8.80 marks.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.680
-You'll get it.
-And Gräf's autograph.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.760
-You need what?
-Signature.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.480
-Oh, right. I'll do it later.
-But do it.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.520
-Yes, I will.
-And the money.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.080
Go home, ladies.

12:23.360 --> 12:27.000
All birds have flown the nest.
There's no one here to give you work.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.200
There is.
A recording clerk for homicide.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.800
Here!

12:30.880 --> 12:33.640
It's an autopsy.
So not someone prone to fainting, OK?

12:35.720 --> 12:37.480
So, who dares to do it?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.240
It's better than nothing.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.240
I'll do it.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.520
I'll pick it up later, OK?

12:47.400 --> 12:48.240
Fine.

12:52.600 --> 12:56.800
This is my train, my goods
which I ordered and have paid for.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.760
If German customs don't release
the goods immediately,

13:00.840 --> 13:02.840
this will have consequences,
you dilettante.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.360
You think it's such a simple matter.
But the Russians gave us hell...

13:05.440 --> 13:06.920
The train is from Russia.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.680
The Russians loaded it.
Don't give me that garbage. Wegener.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.960
-Tell me what's going on.
-I'm afraid it's the Russians.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.240
-Told you so.
-What about them? What do they want?

13:15.320 --> 13:16.480
They want to check the freight.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.800
Until this is resolved,

13:20.880 --> 13:23.120
the Soviet Union has a legal claim
on the contents of the train.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.760
How is this possible?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.960
They suspect we were smuggling something.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.760
From Russia, here?

13:31.840 --> 13:35.600
I'm sure we can clear this up.
Come on, let's check the details.

13:35.880 --> 13:41.160
Now I have to justify myself only because
some obscure Communists claim something.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.600
Hello, Mr. Nyssen.

13:46.680 --> 13:50.120
Have you met? The People's Deputy Trokhin
from the Soviet Embassy.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.160
Hello.

13:51.760 --> 13:55.400
Mr. Nyssen, please don't misunderstand
our intervention.

13:55.480 --> 13:58.800
We don't want to stop the exchange
of goods between our countries.

13:58.880 --> 14:03.320
-But you are doing just that.
-There is one wagon on this train

14:03.400 --> 14:05.840
which has a different freight
than the others.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.640
Just one single one.

14:09.800 --> 14:10.840
What does it contain?

14:10.920 --> 14:13.800
My government
hasn't authorized me to tell you. At the moment, it's only a suspicion.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.760
All this fuss because of a suspicion?

14:20.200 --> 14:22.320
-Yes.
-Do you know what this freight is worth?

14:22.400 --> 14:24.760
Each day that the train sits here
costs a fortune.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.560
If suspicion is not enough for you...

14:28.440 --> 14:30.840
you can go to the police.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.400
Which wagon is it?
Just tell us the wagon number.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.960
I am here to find that out.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.320
Here, sign this.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.840
So you get your things back.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.520
So, which one is it?

15:02.880 --> 15:06.800
Nobody knows.
The freight documents have disappeared.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.200
What? Why?

15:08.520 --> 15:10.960
There was an incident
when the train arrived.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.640
The driver ran off with the papers.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.840
I beg your pardon?

15:15.320 --> 15:17.640
Can't the wagon
be identified right here?

15:18.680 --> 15:21.360
-How do you want to do this?
-We look into them.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.400
As you know, these wagons contain
highly toxic pesticides.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.240
We can't check them here.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.760
Somewhere, you can open them up.

15:29.840 --> 15:30.720
Yes.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.680
At our facility in Zossen.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.760
We've got a shed for such purposes.

15:37.080 --> 15:38.840
Take the wagons there.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.840
-You have the necessary skilled workers?
-Yes, of course.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.600
But not before Monday.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.240
Very well. Organize it. And we will be present at the check.

17:07.360 --> 17:12.560
Seriously, this is number 12,
number 13, and it's only midday.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.000
She's on you like a tick.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.720
You can't stop me
from taking part in the autopsy...

17:16.800 --> 17:18.120
Right, right!

17:18.200 --> 17:20.480
What in God's name is going on?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.640
-I can tell you that.
-No, you won't.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.680
Ah, it's Ms. Stalina in person.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.080
In the name of so-called democracy,
innocent people are executed and...

17:29.160 --> 17:31.200
-Stop the slander.
-These two women

17:31.280 --> 17:34.160
were shot by out-of-control police.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.760
You paint the enemy where you want him.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.240
Shoot first, ask second,
that's how it works here

17:38.320 --> 17:41.480
-when workers exercise their rights.
-You know nothing about this.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.120
You're turning a blind eye on everyone
who is openly breaking the law.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.600
What law did they break exactly?

17:47.680 --> 17:48.800
-Agitator.
-Cover-upper.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.600
-Subversive.
-Murderer!

17:50.680 --> 17:52.320
-Bruno!
-That's enough.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.960
Put them up here. Left-hand corner.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.200
Exactly where they belong.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.800
Here we go again!
Put them in the centre of the table then.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.360
Hang on.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.360
I have no use for you in here, doctor.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.520
I won't leave these people
alone with the victims.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.800
No, please. How am I supposed
to work with all that racket?

18:13.040 --> 18:14.240
I'm staying.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.560
This is my dissecting room

18:16.640 --> 18:19.480
and I decide who gets to dissect with me.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.000
Not you!

18:25.440 --> 18:27.320
Look, it's the doctor for the poor.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.920
Traffic police, what are you doing here?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.320
Lunch break. It's so cosy here.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.760
Why are you bringing
a broad to an autopsy?

18:37.840 --> 18:39.920
Seriously, do you have to?

18:40.360 --> 18:42.360
Everyone else is busy.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.680
Why do you have two bodies? None of your business.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.960
Bruno, why don't you go to the canteen
and order a burger?

18:53.080 --> 18:54.800
They taste like the smell in here.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.560
So, what does our canal swimmer tell us?

18:58.640 --> 19:02.800
Am I the autopsy express?
This is rush hour traffic today.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.720
But judging by his skull I'd say...

19:07.200 --> 19:08.960
he looks like Slavic.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.640
Maybe Russian.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.760
That man was a Russian.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.760
At least he spoke Russian.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.160
I see. And who are you?

19:30.120 --> 19:32.240
Gereon Rath,
special investigator from Cologne.

19:32.960 --> 19:36.800
What does a Cologne special investigator
know about a body from a Berlin canal?

19:36.880 --> 19:38.800
That man broke into my flat last night.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.480
At Elisabeth's place?
Did he steal anything?

19:41.560 --> 19:42.760
What did he want?

19:43.440 --> 19:46.560
Something from the previous tenant,
a certain Mr. Kardakov.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.880
When he tried to escape, he was pushed
into a car and threatened with a gun.

19:50.960 --> 19:54.240
-What make?
-Could have been a Tatra.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.600
Sounds like a Russian affair.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.040
Maybe.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.960
His hands didn't look like this yesterday.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.600
What happened?

20:06.760 --> 20:11.240
Massive contusions.
Must have been under a car.

20:11.320 --> 20:12.720
Doesn't look like an accident though.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.480
I beg your pardon.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.120
-So...
-You mean this was done to him?

20:21.200 --> 20:24.320
Well, the injuries look even, don't they?

20:25.160 --> 20:28.840
Girl, have you just learned to talk
or why are you blabbing on? Get out.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.960
What about your previous tenant,
what was his name?

20:33.640 --> 20:34.960
I said get out!

20:39.400 --> 20:41.040
Kardakov. That's all I know.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.520
My landlady didn't know him very well,
either, but I might...

20:43.600 --> 20:45.760
You might confirm this guy is Russian?

20:46.400 --> 20:48.080
-Yes.
-Very well.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.680
Let's write that down. Case closed.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.480
Your students can turn this Bolshevik
into burgers or something.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.840
Excuse me, but this man
may have been tortured.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.280
In Berlin, the Russians off each other
around the clock. Every man for himself.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.800
One is a Trotskyite, the other Leninist,

21:05.880 --> 21:08.680
Stalinist, anarchist or even tsarist.
It's too confusing.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.960
The more of them go, the better for us.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.280
I'll address the autopsy report to you,
Detective Sergeant?

21:14.360 --> 21:18.040
-You can stuff it.
-Goodbye, Mr. Criminal.

21:18.120 --> 21:21.160
If we had a special squad
for each dead Russian...

21:23.000 --> 21:24.080
What's this?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.920
No idea. A four?

21:44.880 --> 21:46.440
A ten-pack of Overstolz.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.640
-One fifty.
-And I'll have a newspaper.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.880
-A <i>Morgenpost</i>.
-Thank you.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.280
BLOODY RIOTS
IN KREUZBERG AND WEDDING

21:59.360 --> 22:01.880
-For you?
-A two-pack of Havana Gold, please.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.640
That's 1.50.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.560
You smoke cigars?

22:06.800 --> 22:09.160
Oh. It's for the boss.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.680
I don't envy you.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.680
Oh, he's not always like this.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.240
-You mean, he's actually a nice guy?
-No.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.040
But sometimes he's less gruff.

22:23.960 --> 22:28.080
Well, then.
We can ignore the odd murder.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.040
I don't like it, either.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.040
That man was scared.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.960
He wasn't a tough guy.
I realized that too late.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.760
You want to investigate?

22:45.600 --> 22:47.760
It's not that simple.
It's your department.

22:50.320 --> 22:54.120
But no one would ask any questions
if you did some research.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.240
My boss would ask.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.320
He doesn't have to know.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.320
-Cigarette?
-Thank you.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.160
For better times.

23:10.640 --> 23:15.440
Alright. So what else does your landlady
know about this Kardakov?

23:16.200 --> 23:17.480
You remembered the name.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.680
I've got two ears.

23:20.720 --> 23:21.600
So?

23:22.680 --> 23:23.600
Not much.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.440
Allegedly, he's on tour.
But he didn't take his suitcase.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.080
Interesting.

23:32.080 --> 23:32.960
I have to go.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.440
I'll be in touch.

23:35.720 --> 23:36.600
Alright.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.800
And thank you again.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.560
For the other day.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.560
-Traitor!
-What is going on?

24:34.640 --> 24:37.280
-You'll pay for this.
-Why weren't you at the station?

24:37.360 --> 24:38.720
You're asking me?

24:40.560 --> 24:42.840
They were all killed because of you.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.960
-They're all dead!
-What? Who?

24:45.840 --> 24:49.040
Nadia, Nikolayev, Sergey,

24:49.120 --> 24:51.920
Misha, Yuri, Vladimir.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.720
They are all on your conscience.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.120
-Where is the damned knife?
-It was Boris.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.240
The train driver betrayed us.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.200
He wanted it all for himself,
to take the gold to Paris.

25:04.280 --> 25:07.760
He fled and left me there...

25:07.840 --> 25:09.880
I'll kill you, you whore!

25:10.680 --> 25:11.520
And I was arrested.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.400
Look.

25:17.320 --> 25:18.480
From the police. Where is the gold?

25:28.920 --> 25:30.360
The gold is there.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.360
I was in the wagon. I saw it myself.

25:34.440 --> 25:38.880
Lyosha, please believe me.
The train is at the station.

25:38.960 --> 25:43.320
Dearest, nothing is lost yet.
Please believe me.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.320
My love.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.680
Did you really think I could betray you?

25:59.360 --> 26:00.560
Look at me.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.520
You really thought
I could do something like this?

26:07.000 --> 26:07.840
Yes?

26:08.560 --> 26:09.520
Yes.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.200
No.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.480
They killed them all.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.760
They killed them all.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.840
Forgive me.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.280
I'LL SEW ANYTHING
WORK WANTED

27:06.360 --> 27:09.600
SHOEMAKER LOOKING FOR EMPLOYMENT
LOOKING FOR WORK

27:09.800 --> 27:11.760
-Can you watch this for me?
-Yes, sure.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.680
Don't you recognize me anymore?

27:26.280 --> 27:28.320
Kinderland holiday in '22.

27:30.640 --> 27:31.480
Greta!

27:32.560 --> 27:35.360
Greta Overbeck
from Gröningshusen on Darss?

27:37.560 --> 27:39.400
What are you doing in Berlin?

27:39.680 --> 27:40.800
Well...

27:42.080 --> 27:44.920
I... I'm on my lunch break,
are you hungry?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.360
Me? No, thanks, I've eaten.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.800
Come on, it's on me.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.000
-I only came here because of him.
-I see.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.720
Anyway, suddenly Alfons disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.360
Simply gone.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.280
Somehow I've heard this story before.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.280
My parents had warned me about him.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.680
And the only one I met through Alfons
was an older gentleman.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.600
A famous author, I won't tell you who.

28:15.280 --> 28:16.560
Go on.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.160
-No.
-Yes.

28:23.640 --> 28:24.720
-Him?
-Yes.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.760
He helped me at first.

28:29.120 --> 28:32.000
Then he asked me
if I wanted to do his flat for him.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.040
Very gently, like. In a fatherly voice.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.680
Two days later I was back on the street.
And I'm still there.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.560
No one takes on a maid
without a first-hand recommendation.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.240
Would you know something?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.920
Maybe. Yes.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.520
At least you had a bit of luck.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.640
Charlotte Ritter, what was it again?
Assistant investigator?

29:02.560 --> 29:06.720
Correct. And if I put some work into it,
I can even become an inspector.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.560
With the homicide squad?

29:08.640 --> 29:09.880
That'll be 60 pfennigs.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.920
Some of the guys are pretty strange,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.800
but my boss trusts me blindly.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.040
Thank you.

29:17.520 --> 29:22.680
And do you get to see the...
those that were murdered?

29:22.760 --> 29:25.040
The murder victims? Of course.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.800
I'm always first on the scene,
me and the detective sergeant.

29:28.240 --> 29:32.120
Gruesome stuff sometimes.
Recently we had one with no head.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.720
-The axe was still there.
-No!

29:34.840 --> 29:37.920
Then we found the head later.
You won't believe where.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.400
Where?

29:44.440 --> 29:45.280
Excuse me.

29:47.800 --> 29:50.400
Oh, it's... one o'clock already.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.320
I have to run.

29:53.080 --> 29:55.240
But listen,
are you up for going dancing later?

29:56.120 --> 29:57.080
Alright.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.320
At Moka Efti, Friedrichstrasse, 9 p.m.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.200
I'm glad you're here.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.080
Department A.
Homicide and Aggravated Assault.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.960
Miss Isolde, did you
do the two transcripts I asked for?

30:33.160 --> 30:34.720
Please go downstairs for your money.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.640
Hello.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.360
This is really scary.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.960
Miss Isolde. What is it?

30:41.440 --> 30:42.800
I have a question.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.760
How do you become
an assistant investigator?

30:46.560 --> 30:49.000
-Did you finish school?
-Elementary school.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.920
I'd say write an application.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.240
-Vicky, the Huber file.
-Just like that?

30:54.320 --> 30:55.200
Yes, I'm coming.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.560
-To whom?
-The female police.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.840
-Who else?
-Female police?

31:01.760 --> 31:03.120
What do they do?

31:03.200 --> 31:06.800
They question and deal with sexual
and vice offenses of minors.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.200
I want the homicide squad.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.560
You want the homicide squad?

31:15.280 --> 31:18.320
They don't have any women.
Only as typists.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.080
Where do I get those application forms?

31:22.320 --> 31:23.600
Personnel office.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.000
Thank you.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.240
Forgive me, Sveta.

31:39.800 --> 31:45.320
I saw it all happening.
I could do nothing.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.800
Calm down.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.920
We'll find a way.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.920
You have me.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.080
We'll get the gold.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.920
Trotsky will destroy Stalin.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.520
With our help.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.920
With our gold.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.920
Yes, the Russians met here a few times.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.200
His organization is called "Red Fortress".
Thanks. For the best socialism ever.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.840
They were all fervent Trotskyites.
Does that mean anything to you?

32:37.560 --> 32:40.280
It's a communist faction, against Stalin.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.480
They want to free their country
from his yoke.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.200
"Stalin is the gravedigger
of the revolution."

32:49.760 --> 32:50.800
You speak Russian?

32:50.880 --> 32:54.600
It's essential if you're interested
in the giants. Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy.

32:54.680 --> 32:58.000
I personally think
Gulanin is underestimated.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.840
It was wrong to forget about him.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.800
Through my room! Thank God I wasn't there.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.840
Yes, good thing you weren't there
and I had to deal with him on my own.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.800
Please, Ms. Elisabeth,
I didn't mean it like that.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.840
No,
I'm sure you would have driven him away.

33:14.920 --> 33:17.680
That's right,
with the stench of my un-aired room.

33:23.960 --> 33:27.360
Bloody May! Police! Bloody May! Police!

33:27.440 --> 33:29.160
Don't touch the car, get back!

33:34.640 --> 33:35.600
Murderers!

33:39.120 --> 33:40.600
Charlotte! This way!

33:51.040 --> 33:52.280
It's great, right?

33:53.800 --> 33:54.760
Look at this.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.680
Can I try it on?

34:38.880 --> 34:39.800
Thank you.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.320
Go on, take it.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.560
-Can you afford this?
-No.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.320
You are wanted.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.040
Where?

34:55.120 --> 34:57.280
He's already here.
First room on the left.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.520
I'll explain later. Won't take long.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.680
What about you?
Don't tell me you're a virgin.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.160
No, I'm Capricorn.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.320
-Where's the Widow?
-I'm the substitute.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.120
What do you want from her?

35:21.200 --> 35:23.720
-I've got someone for her.
-She'll be back tomorrow morning.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.240
Thanks.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.600
What? Have you never seen
a man in an armchair?

35:41.360 --> 35:43.280
I'm not available for detective sergeants.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.440
Don't worry.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.880
-I only do standard dances.
-Forget it.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.440
I'm not a whore.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.840
You're not registered, that's true.

35:56.720 --> 35:58.000
What's that supposed to mean?

35:58.080 --> 36:02.880
It means you'll look at paragraph 361/6
of the criminal code.

36:03.600 --> 36:06.760
Then you'll know you have to register...

36:07.600 --> 36:09.160
for your job here.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.600
Meaning you'll register with us.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.120
With the vice squad.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.280
I was just here by accident.

36:16.320 --> 36:19.000
That's also a solution. Smart child.

36:19.080 --> 36:22.680
But you don't want me
to take this place apart, right?

36:23.600 --> 36:27.320
You'd be back on the street,
hunting for clients.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.760
Let's deal with this just the two of us.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.440
Right now.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.720
Go on, let's dance.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.200
Come on now.

36:46.720 --> 36:47.720
No.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.320
Excuse me, miss.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.720
Your dress is fantastic.
Do you want to dance?

37:10.080 --> 37:12.040
Miss, are you accompanied?

37:16.160 --> 37:17.160
Is that it?

37:18.720 --> 37:20.280
Not quite.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.120
You and the posh Cologne guy...

37:26.200 --> 37:28.880
I saw you flirting with him already.

37:32.120 --> 37:35.120
That gentleman is a bit too curious
for my liking.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.120
What's that to do with me?

37:40.600 --> 37:42.480
Find out what he's looking for.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.400
Why should I do that?

37:44.480 --> 37:48.240
Because otherwise all this will be
in your certificate of good conduct.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.800
That's not clean, anyway.

37:55.120 --> 37:58.680
But it has to be if you want
to keep working for the police.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.920
Can you do something about that?

38:06.880 --> 38:08.240
I could have a look.

38:26.240 --> 38:30.360
I have this letter in Russian.
Can you tell me what it says?

38:35.640 --> 38:40.760
I won't tell you the intimate conversation
between my flatmate and his lover.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.160
I'm afraid you'll have to.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.640
Because you'll arrest me if I don't?

38:46.760 --> 38:48.160
That's right.

38:50.600 --> 38:53.320
Alright, if you insist.

38:54.840 --> 38:55.960
Ready?

38:57.120 --> 39:00.760
Darling, please pick up my dress
from the cleaners.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.080
Kisses, S.

39:05.920 --> 39:09.000
Svetlana Sorokina. Who is she?

39:10.680 --> 39:12.880
Kardakov's lover, like I said.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.440
He went round her place a lot.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.360
As you know,
Mrs. Behnke doesn't like lady visitors.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.680
I don't like the ladies that visit you.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.280
What about family?

39:22.320 --> 39:26.400
Where would that get us?
They have hotels for that.

39:30.880 --> 39:33.440
Behnke speaking. One moment, please.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.040
Mr. Rath? It's for you.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.200
The chief of police.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.680
Rath.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.040
<i>It's me.</i> Who?

39:45.800 --> 39:48.720
I wanted to ask if you have
looked into the previous tenant.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.240
That's what you're calling for?

39:51.320 --> 39:54.040
<i>I wanted to take advantage</i>
<i>of the office phone.</i>

39:54.880 --> 39:57.880
If there is anything
that needs to be done, I am available.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.960
<i>Actually, I have something for you.</i>

40:00.280 --> 40:03.720
<i>Kardakov's lover lives at Meraner Strasse</i>

40:03.800 --> 40:07.480
number seven.
Svetlana Sorokina. Write it down.

40:08.120 --> 40:11.040
-Consider it done.
-<i>Go check it out tomorrow, OK?</i>

40:12.360 --> 40:13.960
Do you know the Aschinger inn?

40:15.040 --> 40:17.280
Is the earth round? Yes, of course.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.400
I'll meet you there
for lunch tomorrow at one o'clock p.m.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.920
Yes, fine.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.360
<i>Talk soon.</i>

40:30.360 --> 40:33.200
I'm meeting him.
Tomorrow at 1 p.m. at Aschinger's.

40:35.720 --> 40:36.720
Good.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.240
And where will we meet?

40:38.880 --> 40:40.120
Here, of course.

40:48.120 --> 40:49.400
Come on.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.080
At least 200 dead.

40:58.440 --> 40:59.880
I can't imagine that.

41:00.480 --> 41:02.920
I don't believe
Mr. Rath has anything to do with that.

41:03.040 --> 41:06.560
-But he was on duty in Kreuzberg today.
-Samuel, enough of that, OK?

41:09.960 --> 41:12.720
Well, what will we do
with the other half of the evening?

41:32.240 --> 41:33.520
Are you together?

41:34.520 --> 41:35.320
Good.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.480
-Are you alone?
-Yes.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.280
-No children?
-No.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.240
I'm sorry, we're full up.

41:43.240 --> 41:45.080
Only women with children for tonight.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.120
Hello?

42:38.800 --> 42:41.560
Put me through to the Soviet embassy.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.200
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

43:11.560 --> 43:13.480
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

43:15.360 --> 43:17.240
<i>But not yet now</i>

43:19.720 --> 43:22.640
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

43:29.840 --> 43:32.480
<i>Ocean of time</i>

43:33.920 --> 43:35.840
<i>Eternal law</i>

43:37.280 --> 43:39.680
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

43:41.000 --> 43:42.600
<i>To ashes</i>

43:42.680 --> 43:44.560
<i>But not yet now</i>

44:05.720 --> 44:09.440
<i>It must be just a dream</i>

44:09.520 --> 44:14.000
<i>Trying to snatch the wind</i>

44:14.080 --> 44:17.640
<i>Who really knows?</i>

44:20.520 --> 44:23.640
<i>The clock on your wall</i>

44:24.160 --> 44:27.440
<i>It is filled with sand</i>

44:27.680 --> 44:30.920
<i>Put your hand in mine</i>

44:31.360 --> 44:34.560
<i>And let us be forever</i>

44:35.080 --> 44:38.640
<i>Now you make your choice</i>

44:38.720 --> 44:42.840
<i>And throw us</i>
<i>in between happiness and agony</i>
