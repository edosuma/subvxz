(NARRATOR READING)

01:01.453 --> 01:03.220
(KION READING)

01:07.217 --> 01:08.625
HIPPO 1: We were here first.

01:08.627 --> 01:09.626
HIPPO 2: No, we were.

01:09.628 --> 01:11.719
KION:
Everyone please, stay calm.

01:11.797 --> 01:15.465
You all get water but you need
to wait your turn.

01:15.467 --> 01:19.578
But what if there's nothing left
by the time we get our turn?

01:19.655 --> 01:21.154
I've never seen the water
this low.

01:21.231 --> 01:22.806
What will we do
when it runs out?

01:22.808 --> 01:23.916
What will we do?

01:23.992 --> 01:25.659
We all need water.

01:25.735 --> 01:28.161
I... I don't know.

01:28.238 --> 01:30.038
But don't worry, I'm sure
the King has a plan.

01:31.650 --> 01:34.167
SIMBA: Surely, I'm not the
first King of the Pride Lands

01:34.244 --> 01:36.428
to face a water shortage,
Rafiki?

01:36.505 --> 01:38.265
Did any of the earlier kings
find a solution?

01:38.324 --> 01:44.103
If they did, the paintings of the
past do not have many clues.

01:44.179 --> 01:48.332
SIMBA: Interesting. I'm not
familiar with that watering hole.

01:48.334 --> 01:50.091
Do you know where it is?

01:50.169 --> 01:52.093
Well, I do know it is not
in the Pride Lands.

01:52.171 --> 01:54.671
Ooh, I've seen a watering hole
that looks like that.

01:54.673 --> 01:56.356
You have?

01:56.433 --> 01:58.358
I saw it in the Back Lands.

01:58.435 --> 02:00.155
It's a big watering hole
with lots of water.

02:00.179 --> 02:02.863
It was part of the zebra
herds' grazing grounds.

02:02.939 --> 02:05.624
Zebras? That must be
Dahabu's herd.

02:05.701 --> 02:09.611
I didn't realize there was such a
big watering hole on her land.

02:09.688 --> 02:10.963
That's our answer.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.023
I knew my dad would have a plan.

02:13.025 --> 02:16.526
So you want us to take over their
watering hole for the Pride Lands.

02:16.528 --> 02:17.528
You got it, bro.

02:18.788 --> 02:21.640
Uh, I mean, King Bro?

02:21.717 --> 02:24.792
No, Bunga, that is not
what I want.

02:24.870 --> 02:27.462
Kion, I want you to talk
to the zebra leader, Dhahabu.

02:27.539 --> 02:31.391
Ask her if she'd be willing to
share her watering hole with us.

02:31.468 --> 02:33.393
Oh, I guess that can work too.

02:33.470 --> 02:34.987
Do you think she'll say yes?

02:35.063 --> 02:37.063
It is a big request.

02:37.140 --> 02:40.567
Ask her if there's anything
we can give them in return.

02:40.644 --> 02:41.994
We need that water, Kion.

02:42.070 --> 02:43.811
And we need it soon.

02:43.889 --> 02:45.449
Don't worry, Dad,
we won't let you down.

02:47.059 --> 02:49.242
Be alert, guys.

02:49.319 --> 02:51.728
This part of the Back Lands
is leopard territory.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.897
Leopards, schmepards.

02:53.899 --> 02:55.657
We can handle 'em, bring 'em on.

02:55.734 --> 02:56.734
(ROARS)

02:57.236 --> 02:58.660
Makucha!

02:58.737 --> 03:00.070
Wow, that was fast.

03:00.072 --> 03:02.497
Hello, Fuli, Lion Guard.

03:02.574 --> 03:04.257
Long time no see.

03:04.334 --> 03:08.412
Yeah, haven't seen you since we
kicked you out of the Pride Lands.

03:08.414 --> 03:10.931
And I'm here to return
the favor.

03:11.007 --> 03:12.432
You're in my territory now.

03:12.509 --> 03:13.808
So get out.

03:16.588 --> 03:18.588
One, two, three, four, five...

03:18.590 --> 03:20.273
I'm good.

03:20.350 --> 03:21.750
Hey, pick on somebody
your own size.

03:24.020 --> 03:25.020
Why don't you?

03:26.281 --> 03:27.873
There's nobody my size here.

03:27.950 --> 03:30.525
Back off, Makucha. We don't
want any trouble.

03:30.602 --> 03:32.544
We're just passing through.

03:32.621 --> 03:34.271
You wouldn't want to mess
with us anyways.

03:34.273 --> 03:35.497
It's five against one.

03:37.109 --> 03:39.051
(SCOFFS) Four and a half maybe.

03:39.127 --> 03:40.127
Hey!

03:41.204 --> 03:43.538
Oh, he means you.

03:43.615 --> 03:45.891
Come on, Makucha.
Just let us through.

03:45.968 --> 03:46.968
I don't think so.

03:47.711 --> 03:48.885

03:57.145 --> 03:59.738
For now, but pass through
quickly.

03:59.815 --> 04:00.815
And don't come back.

04:04.470 --> 04:05.727
Let's go.

04:05.804 --> 04:08.071
But keep your guard up.
I don't trust that guy.

04:12.902 --> 04:15.420
You're right. There he is again.

04:15.497 --> 04:17.372
Come on out, Makucha.
We know you're in there.

04:20.002 --> 04:22.152
Makucha? Who's he?

04:22.154 --> 04:25.264
Oh. Zebras. Don't worry.
We're friendly.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.991
Yeah, no need to panic and run.

04:27.993 --> 04:29.493
Oh, we never panic and run.

They're incredibly rare.
I've never seen one before.

07:03.148 --> 07:04.748
She's really different
and really pretty.

07:05.984 --> 07:09.653
She's not pretty,
she's incredible.

07:09.655 --> 07:13.339
You are un-Bunga-lievable.

07:13.416 --> 07:17.251
I don't know what that means but
I'll take it as a compliment.

07:17.329 --> 07:19.996
Thank you, little mongoose.

07:19.998 --> 07:20.830
Bunga's actually a...

07:20.832 --> 07:22.274
Mongoose.

07:22.350 --> 07:25.351
If she wants me to be
mongoose, I'm a mongoose.

07:25.428 --> 07:28.280
Dhahabu, hello, my name is Kion.

07:28.356 --> 07:29.263
I'm here with the rest
of the Lion Guard...

07:29.341 --> 07:30.449
The Lion Guard?

07:30.525 --> 07:32.609
Are you here to guard me
from lions? (LAUGHS)

07:36.031 --> 07:38.773
You know, there aren't any
lions is Dhahabu Grove.

07:38.850 --> 07:42.461
There are now. Kion is a lion.

07:42.537 --> 07:43.817
Hmm, I thought lions
were bigger.

07:44.523 --> 07:49.134
Let me start over. I'm the
leader of the Lion Guard.

07:49.211 --> 07:51.027
And this is Fuli, Beshte,
Bunga and Ono.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.304
Hey. Nice to meet you.

07:52.380 --> 07:53.638
Hi. We've already met.

07:53.715 --> 07:56.958
Anyway, we're here for
the Pride Lands because...

07:57.035 --> 08:01.037
The Pride Lands? You came all
the way from the Pride Lands?

08:01.039 --> 08:03.130
How exciting!

08:03.208 --> 08:05.208
Prance with me.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.726
Whatever you say, Dhahabu.

08:06.803 --> 08:07.803
Seriously?

08:09.881 --> 08:12.657
Kion, do we really have
time for this?

08:12.734 --> 08:14.976
We need to ask her
about that watering hole.

08:15.053 --> 08:17.144
I don't know, Fuli,
if we get to know Dhahabu,

08:17.222 --> 08:18.662
she might be more willing
to help us.

08:18.724 --> 08:22.334
Beshte's right. We need to
talk to her and make friends.

08:22.410 --> 08:23.743
Just like my dad said.

08:23.820 --> 08:27.897
Welcome to Dhahabu Grove.

08:27.899 --> 08:30.008
The happiest place
in the Back Lands.

08:30.085 --> 08:31.751
(LAUGHING)

08:33.238 --> 08:34.238
Wow, Dhahabu.

08:35.407 --> 08:36.906
Everyone really does seem
to be happy.

08:36.908 --> 08:38.517
Of course.

08:38.593 --> 08:40.167
Good leaders keep
everyone happy,

08:40.245 --> 08:42.837
and in return,
everyone loves them.

08:42.914 --> 08:44.189
Right?

08:44.266 --> 08:45.840
My dad's a good leader.

08:45.917 --> 08:48.418
Everyone loves him 'cause he
tries to keep everyone safe.

08:48.420 --> 08:50.529
Hmm, really?

08:50.605 --> 08:53.773
Yes, and that's why we're here.

08:53.850 --> 08:55.850
The Pride Lands have had
a tough dry season.

08:55.927 --> 08:57.351
We need more water.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.262
Oh, that's so sad.

08:59.264 --> 09:00.264
It is.

09:02.284 --> 09:04.709
So my dad sent us to ask if we
can share your watering hole.

09:04.786 --> 09:07.771
Our... Watering hole?

09:07.773 --> 09:08.788
You do have one, right?

09:08.865 --> 09:10.531
Well...

09:10.609 --> 09:12.700
Of course we do. It's huge.

09:12.778 --> 09:14.944
The biggest in the Back Lands.

09:14.946 --> 09:16.424
And it would be fun to
meet the Pride Landers.

09:16.448 --> 09:17.722
Can we share it with them?

09:17.799 --> 09:20.049
BOTH: Please?

09:21.136 --> 09:25.212
It would make my herd happy.
But...

09:25.290 --> 09:27.882
We'd be happy to do
something for you in return.

09:27.959 --> 09:28.959
Just name it.

09:30.386 --> 09:32.737
Oh, I know!

09:32.814 --> 09:34.731
You can bring my herd
a Tamboa plant.

09:36.484 --> 09:38.318
BOTH: A Tamboa plant?

09:38.394 --> 09:40.412
A Tamboa plant?

09:40.488 --> 09:43.731
Our favorite food.
A real delicacy.

09:43.809 --> 09:45.453
But if you don't think
you're up to the task,

09:45.477 --> 09:47.252
I quite understand...

09:47.329 --> 09:48.714
You got it. One Tamboa plant,
coming up.

09:48.738 --> 09:49.813
Really?

09:49.815 --> 09:53.074
Sure, whatever you want.
Our pleasure.

09:53.151 --> 09:56.169
Well, okay. Thank you.
And good luck.

09:58.122 --> 10:01.049
Ono, you know what this
Tamboa plant looks like?

10:02.160 --> 10:04.327
Well, I saw one from
the sky once.

10:04.329 --> 10:08.440
But they're incredibly rare. It could
take us days to even find one.

10:08.516 --> 10:09.849
But we don't have days, do we?

10:09.926 --> 10:13.686
Nope. So we better get going.
Come on, Lion Guard.

10:13.763 --> 10:15.229
Bye, Dhahabu.

10:19.268 --> 10:20.434
Any luck, Ono?

10:20.512 --> 10:21.512
Not yet.

10:24.199 --> 10:26.015
Ugh, we've been wandering through
the Back Lands for hours.

10:26.017 --> 10:28.701
Come on, Fuli.
Ono's doing his best.

10:28.778 --> 10:30.703
He did say Tamboa plants
were rare.

10:30.780 --> 10:32.631
Sorry, everyone,
I'm still looking.

10:34.042 --> 10:35.042
A-ha!

10:35.694 --> 10:36.968
Well?

10:37.045 --> 10:40.305
I've spotted a Tamboa plant,
but it's very far away.

10:40.382 --> 10:43.049
And it'll be nearly impossible
for us to get to it.

10:43.126 --> 10:45.143
Since when does "impossible"
stop us?

10:45.220 --> 10:46.627
We're the Lion Guard.

10:46.705 --> 10:48.705
I know, but...

10:48.707 --> 10:51.224
We'll find a way. A lot of

10:51.300 --> 10:52.633
Ono, take the lead.

10:52.711 --> 10:53.768
Affirmative.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.384
Ono, are you sure
this is the only way?

11:01.386 --> 11:03.403
Unfortunately, yes.

11:07.392 --> 11:09.726
Beshte, you okay?

11:09.728 --> 11:11.652
(STUTTERS) Yeah, I guess.

11:11.730 --> 11:13.821
You can do it, Big B.
It's easy, see?

11:13.899 --> 11:15.507
Careful, Little B.

11:15.583 --> 11:17.509
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

11:17.585 --> 11:19.252

11:24.075 --> 11:25.425
Thanks, Fuli.

11:25.501 --> 11:28.094
For a second there, I thought
I was one gone mongoose.

11:28.171 --> 11:29.804
Hakuna Matata, Bunga.

11:32.250 --> 11:36.085
The Tamboa plant is on the other
side of this thorn patch.

11:36.087 --> 11:38.029
You have to go around
to avoid the thorns.

11:38.106 --> 11:39.531
We don't have time to go around.

11:39.607 --> 11:40.607
So let's go through.

11:42.185 --> 11:44.444
Not all of us have thick
skin like you, Bunga.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.988
Hmm. Maybe we can go through.

11:48.099 --> 11:49.615

Whoa, look at that!

11:58.109 --> 11:59.469
You heard Beshte.
Let's follow him.

12:04.282 --> 12:05.372
Yeah.

12:05.450 --> 12:06.450
Whoo.

12:07.452 --> 12:09.043
Nice job, Beshte.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.378
Yeah, that was
un-Bunga-lievable.

12:11.456 --> 12:12.455
Are you okay?

12:12.457 --> 12:14.624
I think so.

12:14.626 --> 12:16.735
Good. 'Cause I think we'll
need you at full strength.

12:16.811 --> 12:18.719
That's a Tamboa plant?

12:18.797 --> 12:20.980
Ono, you said it was rare.

12:21.057 --> 12:22.482
You didn't say it was huge.

12:22.558 --> 12:23.908
It looked smaller from the sky.

12:23.985 --> 12:27.394
We're supposed to carry this
thing back to the zebras?

12:27.472 --> 12:28.654
Seriously?

12:28.731 --> 12:30.807
Ah, leave it to me.

12:30.809 --> 12:32.417
Come on, plantly lanty.
Here we go.

12:32.494 --> 12:35.244

12:37.482 --> 12:39.218
How're we gonna get that
thing out of the ground?

12:39.242 --> 12:42.243
Well, if we can't pull it out,
maybe we can dig it out.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.410
Wait.

12:43.488 --> 12:44.837

12:44.914 --> 12:46.264

12:58.261 --> 12:59.261
Oops. Sorry.

13:00.672 --> 13:01.672
No problem.

13:03.691 --> 13:05.358
Beshte, it's all you now.

13:14.610 --> 13:17.278
One Tamboa plant, ready to go.

13:17.355 --> 13:18.630
Great job, Beshte.

13:18.706 --> 13:20.306
Now let's get that plant
back to Dhahabu.

13:32.628 --> 13:34.887
We love you, Dhahabu!

Let me guess. Now you're
gonna panic and run.

13:43.306 --> 13:44.638
Why would we do that?

13:44.716 --> 13:47.325
We're just surprised to
see a walking Tamboa plant.

13:47.402 --> 13:49.151
It's Beshte doing the walking,
see?

13:53.224 --> 13:55.024
Okay, Dhahabu. One Tamboa
plant, as requested.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.320
I... I never thought you'd
actually find one.

13:59.397 --> 14:00.821
What?

14:00.899 --> 14:02.415
I mean, I hoped you would.

14:02.491 --> 14:05.176
I'm just surprised.

14:05.253 --> 14:07.904
It wasn't easy. But we delivered
our side of the deal.

14:07.906 --> 14:10.590
So if you could show us
the watering hole...

14:10.666 --> 14:11.516
We will! We will!

14:11.593 --> 14:12.593
No!

14:13.669 --> 14:16.079
I'm sorry, the deal's off.

14:16.081 --> 14:17.522
We can't share
our watering hole.

14:17.599 --> 14:18.097
What? But...

14:18.174 --> 14:19.432
Why not?

14:19.508 --> 14:22.176
What do you mean you can't
share the watering hole?

14:22.253 --> 14:24.028
It's... It's, um,
against the rules.

14:24.105 --> 14:25.679
What rules?

14:25.757 --> 14:28.274
The... The, uh, secret rules.

14:28.351 --> 14:30.684
We never heard of
any secret rules.

14:30.762 --> 14:32.203
That's because they're secret.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.689
In fact, you're not allowed to
go to the watering hole either.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.783
Huh? What?

14:37.860 --> 14:39.711
That's right. Nobody can
use the watering hole.

14:39.787 --> 14:40.787
That's my decree.

14:41.439 --> 14:42.439
ZEBRAS: Aw!

14:44.200 --> 14:48.111
I don't get it. Why'd she
send us to get that plant,

14:48.113 --> 14:50.113
if she wasn't going to let
us share the water?

14:50.115 --> 14:52.873
I think Dhahabu's
hiding something.

14:52.951 --> 14:54.278
Ono, try to get a look
at the watering hole.

14:54.302 --> 14:57.044
Maybe there's reason she
doesn't want us to use it.

14:57.122 --> 14:58.122
Affirmative.

Everyone, everyone...

15:06.889 --> 15:09.249
I know why Dhahabu doesn't want
us to see the watering hole.

15:09.317 --> 15:12.076
Why? Because it's empty.

15:12.153 --> 15:13.372
The watering hole
is all dried up.

15:13.396 --> 15:15.471
(GASPS) All dried up?

15:15.473 --> 15:16.489
It's empty?

15:16.565 --> 15:19.083
What? No.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.734
The bird must be seeing things.

15:20.812 --> 15:23.087
I've seen things all right,

15:23.164 --> 15:25.484
but maybe they're things you
don't want anyone else to see.

15:25.741 --> 15:29.076
(LAUGHS) What a funny
bird he is.

15:29.154 --> 15:31.078
Why didn't you tell us, Dhahabu?

15:31.156 --> 15:32.316
This makes us really unhappy.

15:33.841 --> 15:37.326
Wait! Please, come back.

15:37.328 --> 15:39.512
We can frolic! And romp!

15:44.760 --> 15:46.169
So you knew the watering
hole had dried up?

15:46.171 --> 15:50.189
Yes, I saw it a few days ago.

15:50.266 --> 15:52.341
But I don't know
where the water went.

15:52.343 --> 15:54.118
Why didn't you tell your herd?

15:54.195 --> 15:55.620
I didn't want to
make them unhappy.

15:55.697 --> 15:58.514
But zebras can only go
a few days without water.

15:58.516 --> 15:59.849
What were you planning to do?

15:59.851 --> 16:01.701
I don't know.

16:01.777 --> 16:04.111
I guess I hoped it would
fill itself up again.

16:04.189 --> 16:06.189
Seriously?

16:06.191 --> 16:08.002
A good leader tells her
herd the truth, Dhahabu.

16:08.026 --> 16:09.450
Even if it's bad news.

16:09.527 --> 16:12.253
And when there's a problem,
a good leader tries to help.

16:13.881 --> 16:15.881
You're right. I just don't
know what to do.

16:15.958 --> 16:18.050
How about a hug?

16:18.127 --> 16:20.536
We can do better
than that, Bunga.

16:20.538 --> 16:23.039
We'll go to the watering hole
and see if we can figure out

16:23.041 --> 16:24.390
what happened to the water.

16:24.467 --> 16:25.650
Do you think you can fix it?

16:25.727 --> 16:27.059
I don't know but if we can,

16:27.136 --> 16:29.821
will you agree to share it
with the Pride Landers?

16:29.897 --> 16:33.157
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

16:33.234 --> 16:34.514
Lion Guard, let's go
take a look.

16:38.723 --> 16:41.224
Any idea why it dried up?

16:41.226 --> 16:43.484
Well, there used to be
a waterfall over there.

16:43.561 --> 16:45.121
Could that have something
to do with it?

16:45.154 --> 16:46.562
Uh, yeah.

16:46.564 --> 16:47.338
Ono.

16:47.415 --> 16:48.415
On it.

16:51.569 --> 16:53.085
I see the problem.

16:53.162 --> 16:54.679
A rock slide blocked
the waterfall.

16:54.756 --> 16:59.258
Okay, maybe we can unblock it
and let the water flow again.

16:59.335 --> 17:01.175
Lion Guard, let's get to
the top of that cliff.

17:02.263 --> 17:04.689
Wait, that's leopard territory.

17:04.766 --> 17:06.749
We'll take our chances.

17:06.751 --> 17:08.084
Do it all the time.

17:08.086 --> 17:09.185
Then take me with you.

17:11.422 --> 17:15.182
Um, I don't know if
that's such a good idea.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.200
Leopards usually aren't
very nice.

17:16.277 --> 17:17.869
Just leave it to us.

17:17.945 --> 17:19.537
Kion, you said,

"When there's a problem, a good
leader does something about it."

17:24.102 --> 17:25.262

17:27.105 --> 17:28.287

just passing through.

my water? (GROWLS)

the zebras can have water too.

21:17.018 --> 21:19.610
But first, you have to
do something.

21:19.687 --> 21:21.595
Huh? What's that?

21:21.672 --> 21:25.357
You all have to frolic and romp!

21:25.434 --> 21:27.285
<i>♪ Frolic and romp
Frolic and romp ♪</i>

21:27.361 --> 21:28.736
Looks like fun, I'm in.

21:32.183 --> 21:33.741
Come on, Lion Guard. You too.

21:37.021 --> 21:38.370
(ALL LAUGHING)

21:38.447 --> 21:40.464
Frolic and romp.
Frolic and romp.

21:42.026 --> 21:44.043
Watch this, Dhahabu.

21:44.119 --> 21:45.119
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

21:46.622 --> 21:48.306
Bunga!

21:48.382 --> 21:50.474
Ah, come on, Fuli. It's a party!

21:51.794 --> 21:53.202
Fine.

21:53.204 --> 21:55.220
(SARCASTICALLY) Frolic and romp.
Frolic and romp.

22:02.304 --> 22:03.304
(CHORUS VOCALIZING)

22:27.572 --> 22:31.390
<i>♪ Look out
Here comes the Lion Guard ♪</i>
