<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:05.310 --> 00:06.845
You have to admit,
we're really good together.

00:06.879 --> 00:08.747
Yes, yes!
We are!

00:09.715 --> 00:11.015
Chase...

00:11.049 --> 00:13.450
At Hubbard Financial
it's never just an 8 hour day.

00:13.485 --> 00:14.685
Look Lanny,

00:14.719 --> 00:16.920
I would be happy
to look at your portfolio.

00:16.954 --> 00:18.655
I'll send you over
my financials.

00:18.690 --> 00:21.258
You'll get fired
if you don't go.

00:21.292 --> 00:23.059
Yeah, pretty much.

00:23.094 --> 00:27.297
We gotta go, or you're gonna
miss your flight to New York.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.399
How can I leave my baby?

01:38.298 --> 01:40.433
Wasn't perfect,

01:40.468 --> 01:42.469
but it was pretty
damn close.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.504
Chase.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.973
The one and only.

01:54.914 --> 01:57.048
Jack! Wait up!

01:57.116 --> 01:59.284
Mallory called!
She's not coming!

01:59.352 --> 02:00.853
She's sick.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.354
I thought she was supposed
to babysit?

02:02.388 --> 02:04.956
Well, I did too,
but these things happen.

02:04.990 --> 02:07.592
Well, these cows aren't
gonna wait all day, Jack.

02:07.626 --> 02:09.594
Why don't you leave
the baby with the kid?

02:09.661 --> 02:10.995
<i>You good with that, kid?</i>

02:11.029 --> 02:12.997
You said you were gonna
teach me how to herd cattle.

02:13.064 --> 02:14.499
Yeah, tomorrow.

02:14.533 --> 02:15.600
Pay you ten bucks
to babysit.

02:15.634 --> 02:16.567
What do you say?

02:16.635 --> 02:17.568
Ten bucks?

02:17.636 --> 02:20.070
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:20.105 --> 02:21.805
Now hold on.

02:21.839 --> 02:23.940
You gotta be twelve-years-old
to babysit.

02:23.975 --> 02:25.074
I'm eleven and a bit.

02:25.109 --> 02:26.776
Well, that's not twelve,
is it?

02:26.811 --> 02:28.378
<i>As long as I'm your guardian,</i>

02:28.445 --> 02:30.446
we're playing
by the rules.

02:30.481 --> 02:31.414
We've got cows to move,
Jack.

02:31.448 --> 02:32.949
We can't run a daycare.

02:32.984 --> 02:36.585
I'm sorry if your granddaughter
is slowing you down.

02:36.620 --> 02:37.920
There you go, yeah.

02:37.988 --> 02:40.055
We're gonna have to take
a rain check on the cattle.

02:40.089 --> 02:41.657
How is that fair?

02:41.691 --> 02:43.759
No, it's not.
You're right.

02:45.061 --> 02:47.295
And you're right,
she is my granddaughter.

02:47.330 --> 02:49.532
Come here.
That's it.

02:49.566 --> 02:51.901
You go ahead, Jack.
I got it.

02:51.935 --> 02:54.201
The kid and I'll figure
something out.

02:54.236 --> 02:55.770
Right, Katie?

02:55.804 --> 02:58.406
Here.
Let her walk around a bit.

02:59.441 --> 03:01.509
Shhh... shhh...

03:03.679 --> 03:05.112
Yeah, I've been working
him without a bridle

03:05.147 --> 03:06.247
for a while now.

03:06.281 --> 03:07.782
I thought I'd bring him
somewhere new

03:07.816 --> 03:09.516
where there's
more distractions.

03:09.551 --> 03:11.552
I hope I count as
one of those distractions.

03:11.586 --> 03:14.387
Well, I definitely was not
expecting to see you here.

03:14.422 --> 03:16.056
Last I heard,
you were starring in your own

03:16.090 --> 03:17.724
one-man extravaganza.

03:17.759 --> 03:18.926
Chase Powers' Horsepower!

03:18.960 --> 03:20.293
Coming to an arena near you!

03:20.327 --> 03:23.396
Also I've been fielding offers
for my own TV show.

03:23.431 --> 03:25.064
"Chasing The Dream."
Right?

03:25.098 --> 03:26.065
What do you think?

03:26.132 --> 03:27.667
Sounds perfect.

03:27.701 --> 03:29.501
- Allow me.
- Oh, I can get it.

03:29.536 --> 03:32.672
Doesn't mean
I'm gonna let you.

03:36.977 --> 03:38.878
<i>I know I left a
day early,</i> <i>Peter,</i>

03:38.912 --> 03:40.512
<i>but I couldn't stand</i>
<i>being away from Katie</i>

03:40.580 --> 03:42.480
<i>for one more second.</i>

03:42.514 --> 03:43.548
I don't know.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.416
Herding cattle
with a baby?

03:45.451 --> 03:48.019
Not just a baby -
a Fleming baby.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.421
It's in the blood.

03:50.489 --> 03:51.623
I did this
with all the kids.

03:51.657 --> 03:53.157
Well, people did a lot
of stupid things

03:53.192 --> 03:54.225
in the olden days.

03:54.293 --> 03:55.827
Okay.

03:55.895 --> 03:56.827
We're ready.

03:56.895 --> 04:00.130
Yeah.
Oh hey, there's Dad...

04:00.164 --> 04:01.431
<i>And Katie.</i>

04:02.400 --> 04:03.333
Watch this.

04:03.401 --> 04:04.468
We're gonna have so much fun.

04:04.502 --> 04:06.570
Stop! Stop the car!

04:07.672 --> 04:08.706
Dad? No! No!

04:10.742 --> 04:12.642
Hey, Lou!
You're home early.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.376
Obviously,
not early enough!

04:14.444 --> 04:15.645
Hello, my baby.

04:15.713 --> 04:16.813
What's the problem?

04:16.880 --> 04:17.814
Are you okay?

04:17.880 --> 04:18.815
She's fine.
She's fine.

04:18.882 --> 04:20.116
No thanks to you!

04:20.183 --> 04:22.652
Dad, do you have any idea
how insane,

04:22.720 --> 04:24.821
how reckless,
how irresponsible...

04:24.888 --> 04:26.789
How-how much fun!

04:26.824 --> 04:28.624
I did this with you
when you were little.

04:28.691 --> 04:30.158
Yeah, because
I was little, Dad,

04:30.192 --> 04:31.493
and I didn't know
any better.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.561
But you are supposed
to be the grownup.

04:33.630 --> 04:35.864
Honestly, dad,
what were you thinking?

04:35.932 --> 04:38.667
That you wouldn't
be home until tomorrow.

04:40.737 --> 04:42.137
Well, it was great
to see you again.

04:42.204 --> 04:43.304
Yeah.

04:43.372 --> 04:45.039
And I hope you keep
chasing that dream.

04:45.107 --> 04:46.540
Well, that's...

04:46.574 --> 04:47.808
Turns out it's not
exactly the life

04:47.876 --> 04:49.443
for a man
in my situation.

04:49.477 --> 04:51.045
What situation?

04:51.079 --> 04:53.681
Hey! I caught a bit of
your act over there in the ring.

04:53.749 --> 04:55.082
Yeah, ain't she something?

04:55.150 --> 04:57.118
- I'll say.
- Made me feel like a real amateur.

04:57.185 --> 04:58.285
You do some reining?

04:58.319 --> 05:01.087
Well... nothing like
what you can do.

05:01.155 --> 05:03.623
Well, we're working on it.

05:05.893 --> 05:08.161
I'm sure Chase
is a great coach.

05:08.195 --> 05:10.030
He's turned out to be
a pretty great husband too.

05:11.832 --> 05:12.999

06:02.013 --> 06:04.681
It was a crazy,
whirlwind kind of courtship.

06:04.715 --> 06:06.716
Oh...
more like a killer tornado.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.050
We met at one of my clinics...

06:08.085 --> 06:09.384
And three weeks
later we tied the knot!

06:09.419 --> 06:11.053
Wow. Well, congratulations.

06:11.088 --> 06:12.121
Thank you.

06:12.155 --> 06:13.255
So do you guys tour
around together?

06:13.289 --> 06:14.523
Is that how it works?

06:14.557 --> 06:16.592
Well, I have a
few prior commitments,

06:16.626 --> 06:17.927
you know,
dates I booked

06:17.961 --> 06:19.862
before I fell crazy in love
with this girl.

06:19.896 --> 06:21.262
But he promised
to cancel them

06:21.296 --> 06:22.764
just for me.

06:22.798 --> 06:24.665
My family owns a ranch
near Longview

06:24.700 --> 06:26.434
and we plan to settle down
out there.

06:26.468 --> 06:27.769
Me and Chase want
a bunch of kids,

06:27.803 --> 06:29.270
so we gotta get busy.

06:29.338 --> 06:30.605
That's great.

06:30.639 --> 06:31.606
You gonna help me here,
sweetheart?

06:31.640 --> 06:33.407
I'm gonna go anyway.

06:33.442 --> 06:34.976
Yeah, I'll-I'll catch up
to you, babe,

06:35.010 --> 06:37.510
I'm just see this
young lady off here.

06:37.545 --> 06:38.979
Always the gentleman.

06:39.013 --> 06:40.047
Nice to meet you.

06:40.081 --> 06:41.314
You too.

06:43.084 --> 06:45.485
So uh...
What about you?

06:45.519 --> 06:47.287
I see you're still
wearing that promise ring

06:47.355 --> 06:49.156
on your finger?

06:49.190 --> 06:50.657
Ty and me...

06:50.725 --> 06:52.226
We've talked
about marriage.

06:52.260 --> 06:54.227
Oh really?
Just talked?

06:54.261 --> 06:56.095
Well,
we decided to wait.

06:56.130 --> 06:58.064
Well, me and Hayley,
we couldn't wait.

06:58.098 --> 06:59.866
The Viva Las Vegas
wedding chapel was booked up,

06:59.933 --> 07:01.367
so we tied the knot
at city hall.

07:01.401 --> 07:03.936
Oh! City hall,
how romantic.

07:04.004 --> 07:04.904
Actually the romance
happened later

07:04.972 --> 07:05.938
at the Bellagio...

07:05.973 --> 07:08.174
Okay, that's too much
information.

07:08.242 --> 07:10.341
I remember now,
miracle girl,

07:11.477 --> 07:14.545
it was always easy
to get a rise out of you.

07:20.653 --> 07:22.387
Hello!

07:22.454 --> 07:24.789
Agh!
Did something die in here?

07:24.856 --> 07:26.590
Yeah. And now it's
in an advanced state

07:26.658 --> 07:28.225
of decomposition.

07:28.293 --> 07:29.660
Well, don't worry about
cooking me dinner.

07:29.727 --> 07:31.896
I'm pretty sure
I just lost my appetite.

07:31.930 --> 07:34.131
Well, the burners on the stove
don't work anyways.

07:34.199 --> 07:35.866
I keep bugging
Caleb about it.

07:35.934 --> 07:37.768
Oh,
the absentee landlord?

07:37.836 --> 07:39.136
Well, he's not absent.
The first of the month,

07:39.171 --> 07:41.204
he shows up to get
his rent cheque.

07:41.272 --> 07:42.505
I'm glad
I didn't dress up.

07:42.539 --> 07:45.474
Oh, you're never gonna guess
who I ran into today.

07:45.542 --> 07:46.742
Chase Powers.

07:46.811 --> 07:47.777
You're right.

07:47.845 --> 07:48.544
I never would've
guessed that.

07:48.578 --> 07:49.712
And something else

07:49.746 --> 07:51.546
that you would probably
never ever guess

07:51.614 --> 07:52.915
in a million years.

07:52.982 --> 07:54.216
Just tell me, Amy.

07:54.284 --> 07:56.518
He's totally in love.

07:56.552 --> 07:58.787
Really? With someone
other than himself?

07:58.855 --> 08:00.189
He's married -

08:00.256 --> 08:01.389
and to a really
great girl, too.

08:01.457 --> 08:03.125
I met her.
Her name is Hayley.

08:03.193 --> 08:05.327
Huh... you're right.

08:05.394 --> 08:07.128
Never would've
guessed that.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.563
Well, I guess Chase Powers
finally met his match.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.234
Okay, Katie.

08:13.302 --> 08:15.069
Mommy needs a coffee.

08:16.071 --> 08:19.073
What's that?
You want a coffee too?

08:19.107 --> 08:21.375
You want a latte?
Cappuccino?

08:21.443 --> 08:22.575
Hey, Lou.

08:22.643 --> 08:23.877
Oh, Paige! Hi!

08:23.945 --> 08:25.411
I just saw you there
and thought I'd say hello.

08:25.479 --> 08:26.379
That is such
a coincidence;

08:26.413 --> 08:27.647
I was going call
your husband

08:27.715 --> 08:29.249
as soon as I got
into the office.

08:29.283 --> 08:30.516
Oh, Lanny,

08:30.584 --> 08:31.284
he's actually out of town
for a couple of days.

08:31.319 --> 08:33.086
Oh, good to know.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.287
He's so thrilled
you talked him

08:34.355 --> 08:35.755
into going with Hubbard.

08:35.789 --> 08:37.789
I know. 6.3 percent
in the last quarter.

08:37.825 --> 08:39.024
Yeah, and Lanny says

08:39.058 --> 08:41.025
that Martha is a crack
money manager.

08:41.094 --> 08:44.163
Um... Martha,
my supervisor Martha?

08:44.231 --> 08:46.265
When it comes to stocks,
she sure can pick 'em.

08:46.299 --> 08:47.499
Great.

08:47.533 --> 08:48.633
Lanny thinks I should
give her my portfolio

08:48.668 --> 08:49.668
and see what she can
do with it.

08:49.702 --> 08:51.636
Paige, I may have been
in New York

08:51.704 --> 08:52.671
for the last few weeks,

08:52.739 --> 08:54.472
but I was still actively
in charge

08:54.506 --> 08:55.940
of your husbands accounts.

08:55.975 --> 08:57.175
Oh, little Katie,

08:57.209 --> 08:59.477
all this talk about money
is so boring.

08:59.511 --> 09:00.478
All right.
Well, I better go.

09:00.512 --> 09:01.512
I'll see you later,
Lou.

09:01.580 --> 09:02.646
Uh...

09:06.118 --> 09:08.119
Well, you might say

09:08.153 --> 09:10.520
that herding cattle
is as old

09:10.554 --> 09:12.489
as civilization itself.

09:12.523 --> 09:15.259
Older than the old west.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.860
Older than Jack.

09:17.795 --> 09:20.430
I'm talking thousands,
thousands of years ago,

09:20.464 --> 09:22.532
when cattle were first
domesticated.

09:22.566 --> 09:24.634
Now, to move a herd
of cattle,

09:24.668 --> 09:26.668
you gotta have
a lot of patience

09:26.703 --> 09:29.671
and a bit of bovine
psychology.

09:29.706 --> 09:32.708
I like to think of it
as an art or a science.

09:32.742 --> 09:34.676
Oh please, Jack.

09:34.711 --> 09:35.778
It's just cow sense.

09:35.812 --> 09:37.146
Did I ask you?

09:37.180 --> 09:38.915
I'm just-
just cut to the Chase.

09:40.817 --> 09:44.352
Now you need to understand
what they call the flight zone -

09:44.387 --> 09:45.753
<i>see? Right here,</i>

09:45.821 --> 09:47.588
and that side too -

09:47.623 --> 09:51.826
so you can keep the herd calm
but still moving forward.

09:51.860 --> 09:54.362
Or a younger,
faster cowboy,

09:54.397 --> 09:56.798
will just cut 'em off
in his tracks.

09:57.999 --> 10:00.567
Now, the key...

10:00.601 --> 10:02.536
The key is you gotta let
the herd know that you're there,

10:02.570 --> 10:03.870
but you can't scare 'em.

10:03.905 --> 10:05.039
That's right.

10:05.073 --> 10:06.840
Otherwise you got yourself
a stampede!

10:06.874 --> 10:08.375
Will you stop that?!

10:08.443 --> 10:10.811
How old are you two?

10:10.845 --> 10:13.247
And how come we can't play
with some real cows?

10:13.281 --> 10:14.780
Yeah, Jack,
how come?

10:15.715 --> 10:18.818
All right.
Go saddle up copper.

10:18.852 --> 10:19.919
Yes!

10:21.688 --> 10:23.456
She may not have
the "deep insight"

10:23.523 --> 10:24.790
of the inner workings-"

10:24.825 --> 10:26.225
I was trying to teach
her something.

10:26.260 --> 10:27.994
But she's gung-ho!

10:29.396 --> 10:32.264
Well, I can think of a few
other words to describe her,

10:32.298 --> 10:34.132
impatient for one.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.034
Impulsive,
impossible...

10:36.102 --> 10:37.369
Yeah, well,
you're gonna miss her

10:37.437 --> 10:39.304
when she's gone.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.708
Come on, Jack,

10:45.278 --> 10:48.079
it's only temporary,
right?

10:51.549 --> 10:52.583
Yeah.

11:03.727 --> 11:04.794
Caleb.

11:04.862 --> 11:06.029
Ty.

11:06.097 --> 11:08.198
You're a week late.

11:10.134 --> 11:11.567
Where's my rent?

11:11.635 --> 11:13.503
It's called a rent strike,
Caleb.

11:13.570 --> 11:14.504
I'm not paying you
another cent

11:14.571 --> 11:16.106
until I get some
new appliances.

11:16.173 --> 11:17.640
Okay.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.909
Well, I'm gonna have
to raise the rent

11:19.943 --> 11:21.477
to cover the cost.

11:21.545 --> 11:22.645
You're joking, right?

11:22.713 --> 11:24.747
Dude, I am so strapped
for cash,

11:24.781 --> 11:25.882
it practically is a joke.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.449
Well, what happened
to the rodeo circuit,

11:27.518 --> 11:28.918
making money there.
You were doing great.

11:28.986 --> 11:30.486
I can't make money
at the rodeo

11:30.521 --> 11:32.154
if I can't pull
my trailer,

11:32.188 --> 11:34.689
and I can't pull my trailer
if my truck tires are bald,

11:34.757 --> 11:37.158
and I can't fork over
more dough for new tires

11:37.192 --> 11:40.896
if I can't get to the rodeo
in the first place.

11:40.963 --> 11:42.597
Well, this is a classic
no-win situation

11:42.665 --> 11:43.965
because I'm not giving you
another cent.

11:47.236 --> 11:50.371
Is there any more beer
in there?

11:53.141 --> 11:55.075
Amy...

11:55.109 --> 11:56.109
I was looking for you.

11:56.177 --> 11:58.245
Oh! You came
to the right place.

11:58.312 --> 12:00.480
I wanna give something
to you.

12:03.084 --> 12:05.085
One day, that'll be
a collector's item.

12:05.119 --> 12:06.719
Yeah,
I'm sure it will.

12:06.754 --> 12:08.320
So... what brings you here?

12:08.388 --> 12:10.056
Uh, well, Hayley's a bit
of a reiner,

12:10.090 --> 12:13.225
and she was so impressed
by what you were doing,

12:13.260 --> 12:14.861
that she wants
to try it too.

12:14.895 --> 12:16.195
Without the saddle
and bridle?

12:16.229 --> 12:17.363
Yup.

12:17.397 --> 12:18.497
And she figured
you were the perfect person

12:18.532 --> 12:19.766
to show her
how to do it.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.467
You could teach her
just as well as I could.

12:21.501 --> 12:23.535
I know,
but she wanted you.

12:23.570 --> 12:24.970
I don't know...

12:25.004 --> 12:27.439
She said, "Chase,
if you wanna ruin a marriage,"

12:27.473 --> 12:30.241
teach your wife to drive a car
or ride a horse."

12:30.276 --> 12:32.578
And I'm betting she already
knows how to drive.

12:32.612 --> 12:34.012
I knew you couldn't
say "no."

12:34.047 --> 12:35.180
Hold on.
I didn't say anything.

12:35.247 --> 12:36.949
No. But you did reveal
a total understanding

12:36.983 --> 12:39.249
of the situation
I find myself in.

12:39.284 --> 12:41.485
So what do you say?

12:41.519 --> 12:44.589
Can you help me out with
a few coaching sessions?

12:44.623 --> 12:46.657
I guess I can move
some things around.

12:46.692 --> 12:49.093
That's great,
that's great.

12:49.127 --> 12:52.797
Uh, so I'll call you
and set that up.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.934
You know,
I gotta say,

12:57.969 --> 13:00.804
being back here,
and seeing you again,

13:00.838 --> 13:03.740
it's like a little trip
down memory lane.

13:03.774 --> 13:06.009
Chase 'n' Amy,
Ring of Fire.

13:06.844 --> 13:08.578
Those were the days.

13:10.647 --> 13:12.982
We were quite the team.

13:13.049 --> 13:15.383
We were never a team,
Chase.

13:15.451 --> 13:18.887
Well, we were something,
that's for sure.

13:31.934 --> 13:34.035
That's one
cranky little girl.

13:34.069 --> 13:35.637
First day back at daycare.

13:35.704 --> 13:36.971
If it was anything
like my day,

13:37.006 --> 13:39.373
I can understand
why she's miserable.

13:39.407 --> 13:40.808
That good, hey?

13:40.843 --> 13:42.610
I ran into Lanny Barrick's
wife in town

13:42.677 --> 13:44.544
and she told me
what a financial genius

13:44.612 --> 13:46.079
my supervisor is.

13:46.114 --> 13:47.714
Except I made
all the stock picks,

13:47.749 --> 13:49.616
and she took all the credit.

13:49.651 --> 13:51.885
Your supervisor
went behind your back?

13:51.953 --> 13:53.186
I knew she was jealous

13:53.220 --> 13:55.288
ever since Martin sent me
to New York and not her,

13:55.356 --> 13:56.690
so she totally
backstabbed me

13:56.758 --> 13:58.058
and got her hooks
nice and deep

13:58.092 --> 13:59.224
<i>into your buddy Lanny.</i>

13:59.292 --> 14:00.559
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:00.627 --> 14:02.962
He probably
doesn't even know.

14:03.030 --> 14:05.164
Sounds like your
supervisor is a total weasel.

14:05.231 --> 14:06.732
Welcome to my world.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.934
You should get another
world 'cause your world sucks.

14:11.104 --> 14:12.437
I should say
something to Lanny.

14:12.505 --> 14:13.605
Bad idea.

14:14.574 --> 14:16.975
No, but shouldn't I just-

14:17.043 --> 14:18.276
shouldn't I tell him

14:18.310 --> 14:19.844
what Lou's supervisor's
doing behind her back?

14:19.912 --> 14:21.112
Well, except now,

14:21.180 --> 14:22.747
you'll be the one that's
going behind Lou's back.

14:22.815 --> 14:24.415
- No, it's different.
- It's different.

14:24.483 --> 14:25.784
And if it turns out
that somebody's messing

14:25.818 --> 14:26.751
with my daughter,

14:26.819 --> 14:28.753
I can't just stand back.

14:28.821 --> 14:30.055
You gotta see that.

14:30.122 --> 14:31.855
All I see is an idea

14:31.923 --> 14:35.025
that's going from bad
to worse.

14:42.266 --> 14:43.433
His name is Roxy.

14:43.501 --> 14:44.768
I was looking for
a new reining horse

14:44.836 --> 14:47.203
and a friend of mine
turned me on to Chase

14:47.270 --> 14:48.470
that's how we met,
isn't it, honey?

14:48.538 --> 14:50.006
Yeah, after our second date,

14:50.040 --> 14:52.909
I just gave her the damn horse
instead of a diamond ring.

14:52.943 --> 14:54.877
You better believe
I got the ring too!

14:54.945 --> 14:56.579
Okay. Where do you want
the horse?

14:56.646 --> 14:58.114
Uh, you can put him
in the round pen.

14:58.182 --> 15:00.316
All right,
I'll get the gate.

15:00.350 --> 15:01.450
I told Chase,

15:01.518 --> 15:02.718
if I get to be half
as good as you,

15:02.752 --> 15:03.852
we could have our own
little Wild West show

15:03.920 --> 15:05.420
right at our ranch.

15:05.454 --> 15:06.922
Put that damn trailer up
on blocks

15:06.989 --> 15:08.590
and let the clients
come to us.

15:08.624 --> 15:10.759
Is that what Chase wants?

15:10.793 --> 15:13.595
Well, they say a tiger
doesn't change his stripes,

15:13.629 --> 15:15.931
but that blue-eyed tomcat
never met anyone

15:15.965 --> 15:17.165
like me before.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.970
You're a lucky man, Ty.

15:23.004 --> 15:24.939
Amy's a great girl.

15:25.907 --> 15:28.142
No argument there.

15:28.176 --> 15:30.010
Look, I know we've had
our differences in the past,

15:30.045 --> 15:33.080
but let me give you
a little bit of advice.

15:33.115 --> 15:34.215
Really.

15:34.249 --> 15:36.382
Relationship advice
from Chase Powers.

15:36.416 --> 15:38.184
Look,
all I'm saying is,

15:38.252 --> 15:40.353
if you don't walk that girl
down the aisle,

15:40.387 --> 15:42.455
someone else will.

15:50.208 --> 15:51.241
Just so you know,

15:51.276 --> 15:52.443
I haven't done much
bareback riding.

15:52.478 --> 15:54.545
Oh, that's okay.
I'll be right here with you.

15:54.580 --> 15:57.280
Maybe we could start
with the bridle on.

15:57.314 --> 15:58.849
That's cheatin'.

15:58.883 --> 16:00.383
Come on,
give it a shot.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.051
Well, you know,
if you feel more comfortable

16:02.086 --> 16:03.353
with the bridle on,
that's fine.

16:03.387 --> 16:05.689
Come on, babe. Go for it!

16:05.723 --> 16:06.656
Can you give me
leg up?

16:06.691 --> 16:08.024
Yes, I can.

16:08.058 --> 16:09.926
- Okay. On three?
- Okay.

16:09.961 --> 16:11.294
Okay,
one, two...

16:11.328 --> 16:13.095
You- you know what?

16:13.129 --> 16:15.698
Um, Roxy has really never done
anything like this before.

16:15.732 --> 16:18.066
<i>How about you take him</i>
<i>for a little test drive first?</i>

16:18.101 --> 16:19.902
Yeah, of course.

16:21.671 --> 16:22.805
Okay.

16:30.980 --> 16:32.847
<i>He responds so nicely,</i>

16:32.882 --> 16:36.651
I'm surprised you haven't
ridden him bareback before.

16:36.719 --> 16:37.919
Chase!

16:39.254 --> 16:41.288
Uh, Chase,
what are you doing?!

16:41.323 --> 16:43.157
Just feeling the old magic.

16:43.225 --> 16:44.425
What old magic?

16:44.459 --> 16:45.859
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

16:45.894 --> 16:47.293
<i>They toured together</i>
<i>for a couple of months</i>

16:47.328 --> 16:48.929
on the Ring of Fire.

16:48.997 --> 16:50.363
Months?

16:50.431 --> 16:53.667
<i>That was a couple</i>
<i>of years ago.</i>

16:53.735 --> 16:56.570
Well, I bet they put on
one hell of a show.

16:56.638 --> 16:58.005
Ladies and gentlemen!

16:58.072 --> 17:01.874
Chase Powers and Amy Fleming
together again!

17:01.942 --> 17:02.975
Great.

17:05.579 --> 17:06.612
Woo!

17:13.252 --> 17:14.286
Real nice.

17:19.559 --> 17:21.259
I like this one.

17:21.292 --> 17:22.594
Tim, hi!

17:23.395 --> 17:25.730
Saw you standing over here,
you looked a little lost.

17:25.798 --> 17:26.964
Hope you don't mind.

17:27.032 --> 17:28.867
Not at all,
are you kidding?

17:28.935 --> 17:29.868
It's so serendipitous.

17:29.936 --> 17:31.235
It's Lanny's birthday

17:31.303 --> 17:32.870
and I wanted to get him
one of these,

17:32.938 --> 17:34.838
but they all look
the same to me.

17:34.906 --> 17:36.106
Well, I've been trying
to get a hold of him.

17:36.174 --> 17:37.675
I called him
a few of times.

17:37.742 --> 17:39.076
He's out of town
for a couple of days.

17:39.143 --> 17:40.644
Ah. Well, that's the one.

17:40.712 --> 17:41.979
Now all he needs to be
a real weekend cowboy

17:42.013 --> 17:43.581
are a couple roping lessons.

17:43.648 --> 17:45.215
Are you offering?

17:45.283 --> 17:46.617
Sure, yeah,
why not?

17:46.685 --> 17:47.885
Well, I'd pay you,
of course.

17:47.953 --> 17:50.620
Oh no, no.
It'd be my gift to Lanny.

17:50.654 --> 17:53.255
That's so great.
Wow.

17:53.290 --> 17:55.291
I owe you one.

17:55.358 --> 17:57.827
Well, actually,
there is something.

17:57.861 --> 18:00.129
Lou mentioned that you ran
into each other yesterday.

18:00.197 --> 18:01.731
And your adorable
granddaughter.

18:01.799 --> 18:03.066
Right.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.834
Well, she said that Lanny
got some investment advice

18:05.902 --> 18:07.970
from-from her supervisor.

18:08.037 --> 18:10.371
Yeah. Martha.
She's amazing.

18:10.406 --> 18:11.406
Yeah...
Well, actually,

18:11.440 --> 18:15.310
those hot stock tips
came from Lou.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.213
The supervisor
just took the credit.

18:18.247 --> 18:20.681
Oh, that's not
what Lanny said.

18:20.716 --> 18:22.016
But you're Lou's dad

18:22.050 --> 18:24.318
so it's natural that
you'd see things differently.

18:24.385 --> 18:26.921
No, that's the way
it was.

18:26.955 --> 18:30.124
Lou did all the work
on Lanny's account.

18:30.191 --> 18:31.425
Okay, but you have
to admit

18:31.459 --> 18:33.661
you're not the most
reliable source,

18:33.695 --> 18:34.662
and maybe this isn't
appropriate

18:34.696 --> 18:35.763
for us
to be talking about.

18:35.797 --> 18:36.830
Maybe.

18:36.864 --> 18:39.099
But my daughter's
getting shafted.

18:39.133 --> 18:43.036
It might be inappropriate,
but I'm gonna talk about it.

18:43.070 --> 18:44.237
Okay.

18:45.072 --> 18:49.208
I'll tell Lanny
we had this conversation.

18:49.243 --> 18:50.243
What's that guy trying
to prove

18:50.277 --> 18:51.911
riding double like that?

18:51.946 --> 18:53.112
It was like
he couldn't help it;

18:53.146 --> 18:54.947
That's just
the way he is.

18:54.981 --> 18:56.481
Show off!

18:56.516 --> 18:59.084
Uh, I was gonna say
showman.

18:59.119 --> 19:00.953
Yeah, a showman
who acts like a jerk.

19:00.987 --> 19:02.254
Did you know he didn't
even tell his wife

19:02.288 --> 19:03.889
that you two worked
together?

19:03.923 --> 19:05.223
Really.

19:05.258 --> 19:06.491
Big surprise.

19:06.526 --> 19:08.193
Chase Powers keeping secrets
from his wife.

19:10.095 --> 19:12.063
I don't feel good
about any of this.

19:12.097 --> 19:13.131
I got talked
into something,

19:13.198 --> 19:15.399
and now I wish it would
just go away.

19:15.433 --> 19:16.968
Yeah, so do I.

19:17.002 --> 19:19.170
And I see him with his arm
around you again,

19:19.204 --> 19:22.439
I'm gonna do something
about it.

19:24.609 --> 19:26.476
That's kinda of funny.

19:26.510 --> 19:28.611
You got roped into giving
roping lessons

19:28.646 --> 19:29.813
to Lanny Barrick.

19:29.847 --> 19:30.947
- Yeah.
- And now he wants me to take

19:30.982 --> 19:32.115
a couple of steers over
to his place

19:32.150 --> 19:33.616
<i>so he can practice.</i>

19:33.651 --> 19:35.652
Let me guess,
I have to help you.

19:35.687 --> 19:37.854
Hey, I got some free time.

19:37.889 --> 19:38.955
I wouldn't mind
taking the steers

19:38.990 --> 19:40.290
over to the Barrick's place
for you.

19:40.324 --> 19:42.124
That'd be great.
Thanks.

19:42.159 --> 19:43.726
What's the catch?

19:43.794 --> 19:44.927
What do you mean?

19:44.995 --> 19:46.628
I mean what do you want?

19:47.597 --> 19:49.065
Just because
I'm being a nice guy

19:49.099 --> 19:50.099
and trying to help you out

19:50.133 --> 19:51.333
that means
there's a catch?

19:51.367 --> 19:53.703
Yeah. Exactly.
What do you want?

19:54.637 --> 19:55.771
A loan.

19:55.806 --> 19:56.705
- A loan?!
- Yes, sir.

19:56.739 --> 19:58.206
- How much?
- Not too much.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.507
Just twelve hundred dollars,

19:59.541 --> 20:02.177
and I would pay you back
nearly immediately.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.878
- Come on, Jack.
- A small, short-term loan.

20:03.946 --> 20:05.313
It's just for truck tires.

20:05.380 --> 20:06.380
Sounds reasonable.

20:06.415 --> 20:07.415
Help me get back
on the circuit.

20:07.449 --> 20:08.583
Man's gotta make a living.

20:08.617 --> 20:10.085
All right,
just a minute,

20:10.119 --> 20:12.120
let's back up
just a couple of steps here.

20:12.188 --> 20:13.087
The part about the tires?

20:13.154 --> 20:14.354
Man's gotta make
a living?

20:14.388 --> 20:17.457
To the part where you asked me
for a loan...

20:17.491 --> 20:19.193
'Cause the answer's no.

20:19.227 --> 20:21.929
I already pay you
more than you're worth.

20:21.996 --> 20:24.064
Okay.
What about you?

20:24.999 --> 20:27.667
Can you help me out,
Tim?

20:33.506 --> 20:35.608
Georgie!
There you are.

20:35.675 --> 20:37.243
I'm waiting for you.

20:37.310 --> 20:38.410
What do you like better,

20:38.445 --> 20:40.312
peanut butter and jelly
or ham and cheese?

20:40.347 --> 20:41.814
Well,
I like 'em both,

20:41.882 --> 20:42.815
but I thought
we were moving cattle

20:42.883 --> 20:44.516
not going on a picnic.

20:44.584 --> 20:46.684
We are,
but it takes hard work

20:46.753 --> 20:48.453
and you need to keep up
your strength.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.988
Well, don't bother
making one for Tim,

20:50.056 --> 20:51.589
he's got a prior
commitment.

20:51.657 --> 20:53.358
Okay. More for us.

20:54.293 --> 20:57.796
You know,
I was just wondering...

20:57.864 --> 20:59.397
Have you ever read
the guidelines

20:59.465 --> 21:02.333
to who can be foster parent
in Alberta?

21:02.401 --> 21:05.202
Can't say as I have, no.

21:05.271 --> 21:07.538
Well, you can't be
too young.

21:07.573 --> 21:10.074
You have to be eighteen
or older.

21:10.142 --> 21:13.244
Like as old as you are,
or even older.

21:13.312 --> 21:15.112
There's no age maximum.

21:15.180 --> 21:16.814
So what's your point?

21:16.882 --> 21:19.150
Nothing.
It's just...

21:19.217 --> 21:21.218
You know,
you could be a dinosaur

21:21.253 --> 21:24.554
<i>and still apply</i>
<i>to be a foster parent.</i>

21:25.556 --> 21:27.591
Okay.
Come on, let's go.

21:34.298 --> 21:36.199
What do you want,
you ol' fleabag?

21:41.839 --> 21:42.571
Hello, Lou.

21:42.606 --> 21:43.706
Hey.

21:43.774 --> 21:46.442
Just saying hi,
you know.

21:46.476 --> 21:47.410
How's your day?

21:47.444 --> 21:48.912
How's my day?

21:48.946 --> 21:52.014
You wanna know about my day?
Read my blog.

21:54.184 --> 21:55.517
"Maybe I'm paranoid,"

21:55.551 --> 21:57.019
but the bow wow
in the corner office

21:57.053 --> 21:58.987
dumped a huge pile
of make-work projects

21:59.022 --> 22:00.422
on my desk.

22:00.456 --> 22:01.690
And when I complained,
she said,

22:01.757 --> 22:05.027
"if you don't like it,
you know what you can do."

22:05.061 --> 22:07.161
Hmm.
Well, if I were you,

22:07.196 --> 22:09.163
I'd tell her to take the job
and shove it.

22:09.198 --> 22:12.733
Yes, but you do not have a baby
or a house to build.

22:12.767 --> 22:14.268
How am I supposed
to pay my bills?

22:14.303 --> 22:15.870
Speaking of bills...

22:15.904 --> 22:17.038
I don't suppose you'd
be willing to lend me

22:17.072 --> 22:18.840
twelve hundred dollars?

22:18.874 --> 22:20.308
Um... what? Sorry.

22:20.342 --> 22:22.210
You wanna borrow
twelve hundred dollars from me?

22:22.244 --> 22:23.510
Yes, I do.

22:23.545 --> 22:24.511
It's for new truck tires,

22:24.546 --> 22:25.512
and you know
I'm good for it.

22:25.547 --> 22:27.147
I'd pay you back.

22:27.181 --> 22:29.115
Why don't you just use
a credit card?

22:29.150 --> 22:31.585
Or borrow money from a bank
like everybody else?

22:31.619 --> 22:33.119
Do you know
of a financial institution

22:33.154 --> 22:34.855
willing to lend money
to rodeo cowboys

22:34.889 --> 22:37.157
with a part-time gig
as a ranch hand?

22:37.191 --> 22:40.660
Maybe the time has come for you
to get a real job.

22:40.694 --> 22:42.128
Like you?

22:42.163 --> 22:43.230
Ouch.

22:43.464 --> 22:44.364
Mm-hm.

22:45.699 --> 22:46.900
You know what?
Never mind.

22:46.934 --> 22:47.901
I actually, I know a guy
down at the track.

22:47.935 --> 22:49.302
It'll be fine.
He loan me-

22:49.337 --> 22:52.339
What, you miss a payment
and he breaks both your legs?

22:52.373 --> 22:54.407
Give me a break, Caleb.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.085
Hey.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.186
Amy!

23:09.356 --> 23:10.822
What's up?

23:10.857 --> 23:13.992
Look... I think Hayley
has great potential,

23:14.026 --> 23:16.761
and Roxy is
an amazing horse,

23:16.828 --> 23:18.897
but I should've never agreed
to get involved.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.698
What you mean?
It's going well.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.234
No, it's not, Chase.

23:23.302 --> 23:25.136
I don't wanna work
with you again.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.304
Really?

23:27.571 --> 23:29.373
What, did your boyfriend
say something?

23:29.407 --> 23:32.609
No. This is not
about him, okay?

23:32.676 --> 23:34.978
It's...
It's about you.

23:37.048 --> 23:38.681
Why wouldn't
you tell Hayley

23:38.749 --> 23:39.883
that we travelled
around together,

23:39.951 --> 23:42.219
that we toured together.
I mean...

23:42.287 --> 23:44.120
Well, how could you keep
that a secret from her?

23:44.187 --> 23:46.489
What? You tell your boyfriend
every little thing?

23:46.557 --> 23:48.057
Pretty much.

23:49.026 --> 23:50.393
Well, there are some things

23:50.461 --> 23:52.261
a man might just wanna
keep to himself,

23:52.329 --> 23:55.498
like what happened
between us.

23:55.566 --> 23:58.100
Ugh! Nothing happened
between us.

23:58.168 --> 24:02.771
And you managed
to convince yourself of that.

24:02.806 --> 24:05.706
I guess you don't remember it
like I do.

24:20.761 --> 24:23.129
Sweetie, was that Amy?

24:23.163 --> 24:25.497
How come you didn't tell me
she was coming by?

24:25.532 --> 24:27.999
Uh, it was kind of
a surprise.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.202
Uh... listen,

24:30.269 --> 24:31.770
I don't think you two
should work together any more,

24:31.838 --> 24:33.972
and I told her as much.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.374
You told her...

24:35.442 --> 24:37.108
Before you even
talked to me?

24:37.176 --> 24:38.477
Yeah,
I guess I probably

24:38.511 --> 24:39.945
should've said
something to you.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.145
Yeah, that's usually
how it goes

24:41.179 --> 24:43.481
when two people
are married.

24:43.515 --> 24:46.217
So what's really
going on?

24:47.285 --> 24:49.153
Well, Amy and I...

24:50.322 --> 24:54.058
Might have done
some touring around together.

24:54.092 --> 24:55.159
And was Amy right

24:55.227 --> 24:58.928
when she said
that nothing happened?

24:58.963 --> 25:01.097
Well,
you know how it is.

25:01.131 --> 25:02.432
She had a thing for me

25:02.467 --> 25:03.667
and then when I didn't
reciprocate -

25:03.701 --> 25:05.935
because I was dating her
best friend -

25:05.970 --> 25:09.773
let's just say,
she didn't take it too well.

25:09.807 --> 25:10.940
Well, I wish you
would've said something

25:10.975 --> 25:12.175
before I made
a fool of myself

25:12.209 --> 25:14.377
asking her
for riding lessons.

25:14.444 --> 25:15.511
I feel really stupid now.

25:15.545 --> 25:16.846
So do I.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.447
I mean, I thought
she'd be over it.

25:18.482 --> 25:21.183
But I guess when
she saw us together...

25:21.217 --> 25:24.119
She's probably
just jealous.

25:25.188 --> 25:28.323
Look, babe, this...
This sort of thing,

25:28.358 --> 25:29.991
it happens to me
all the time.

25:30.025 --> 25:32.927
You know how it is,
being in the public eye.

25:32.961 --> 25:35.029
Sometimes you just gotta
forgive,

25:35.063 --> 25:37.632
forget,
and uh... move on.

25:41.602 --> 25:42.469
 Okay.

25:43.739 --> 25:45.071
What about my horse?

25:45.106 --> 25:46.707
Pick him up,

25:46.741 --> 25:51.077
and it'll be like
none of this ever happened.

25:57.318 --> 25:58.585
Here you go.

25:58.620 --> 26:00.153
Oh, thank you.

26:00.187 --> 26:03.088
You know, I can honestly
say I used to love my job.

26:03.123 --> 26:04.123
Used to?

26:04.157 --> 26:05.458
Well,
what about now?

26:05.492 --> 26:07.860
Now? I'm just another
mid-level employee

26:07.895 --> 26:10.329
who hates her supervisor,

26:10.363 --> 26:12.865
and the feeling
is obviously mutual.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.534
Well, I hope that didn't
have anything to do

26:14.568 --> 26:16.135
with your dad.

26:16.169 --> 26:18.369
With Dad...

26:18.438 --> 26:19.438
What do you mean?

26:19.472 --> 26:21.372
Oh, well,
he was upset to hear

26:21.407 --> 26:24.309
you were getting the short end
of the stick and...

26:24.343 --> 26:26.110
Well, he might've
said something

26:26.145 --> 26:28.112
to that buddy of his.

26:28.147 --> 26:30.248
What buddy?
Who-who are we taking about?

26:30.282 --> 26:32.183
You know,
the weekend cowboy.

26:32.217 --> 26:33.751
Lanny Barrick?!

26:33.819 --> 26:36.420
Dad said something
to Lanny Barrick.

26:36.488 --> 26:38.088
Oh my God!

26:38.156 --> 26:39.222
And Lanny must've
said something

26:39.290 --> 26:40.558
to my supervisor.

26:40.592 --> 26:43.461
No wonder she was extra mean
at work today, Grandpa.

26:43.495 --> 26:44.628
I mean,
she's always nasty,

26:44.663 --> 26:46.730
but it's like she had it
out for me today.

26:46.798 --> 26:48.298
I can't believe Dad
would do this.

26:48.333 --> 26:49.699
Don't go jumping
to conclusions.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.367
I told him,
in no uncertain terms,

26:51.401 --> 26:54.070
not to do
anything stupid.

26:54.104 --> 26:57.006
This is Dad
we're talking about.

27:00.544 --> 27:02.178
Dad?!

27:02.245 --> 27:04.380
Uh-oh! Here comes trouble.

27:04.414 --> 27:05.647
What?

27:05.682 --> 27:07.850
Seriously, Dad,
going behind my back?

27:07.917 --> 27:09.050
- Like I said, trouble.
- Let's go.

27:09.118 --> 27:10.285
What were you thinking, Dad?

27:10.353 --> 27:11.987
I am supposed to be
a professional!

27:12.054 --> 27:12.988
I know! I know!

27:13.055 --> 27:14.055
I was just trying
to help.

27:14.090 --> 27:15.457
Help? Dad, how do you
think it looks

27:15.492 --> 27:17.192
when my daddy talks
to a client for me?

27:17.259 --> 27:18.226
Well, somebody had to.

27:18.260 --> 27:19.928
Yeah, but not you!
That's my job!

27:19.996 --> 27:21.596
- I can fix this.
- No, Dad,

27:21.663 --> 27:22.663
you've done enough.

27:22.698 --> 27:23.831
I'll fix it myself,
I'm a big girl.

27:23.899 --> 27:26.066
Lou, I'm sorry.

27:26.134 --> 27:27.201
I never should've
gone there.

27:27.268 --> 27:28.736
No kidding.

27:28.804 --> 27:30.471
Well, at least now you know
the devil you're dealing with.

27:30.539 --> 27:32.106
Yeah.

27:32.173 --> 27:34.976
I'm seeing the real ugly side
of the corporate world.

27:35.010 --> 27:37.044
Is there another side?

27:38.013 --> 27:40.014
You know what, Dad?
I gotta go make some calls.

27:40.048 --> 27:43.050
Honey, wait, wait.

27:43.118 --> 27:44.251
Why don't you come
for a ride?

27:44.319 --> 27:46.453
- No, I don't-
- Lou,

27:46.488 --> 27:48.989
you know there's nothing like
sitting on a horse

27:49.057 --> 27:50.790
to help gain
some perspective.

27:55.062 --> 27:57.096
You know,
I was thinkin'...

27:57.164 --> 28:00.466
It's too bad the whole Chase 'n' Amy thing
didn't work out.

28:00.534 --> 28:02.235
With Spartan
and the Liberty work,

28:02.302 --> 28:05.038
we could've made
a fortune.

28:05.072 --> 28:06.639
Are you here to pick up
your horse?

28:06.673 --> 28:07.907
Yeah...

28:11.010 --> 28:13.245
And ask you
a question.

28:13.279 --> 28:15.547
Why did you really quit?

28:15.581 --> 28:18.450
Because you were acting
all weird.

28:18.484 --> 28:20.852
You're married, Chase,
to a really nice woman.

28:20.886 --> 28:22.854
I know. She's great.

28:22.888 --> 28:24.289
I'm a lucky man.

28:24.323 --> 28:28.025
You sure have a funny way
of showing it.

28:28.060 --> 28:29.960
Well, Amy Fleming,
what if I told you

28:29.994 --> 28:32.229
that you're just not
that easy to forget.

28:32.264 --> 28:33.464
Chase...

28:33.498 --> 28:37.068
Well, remember how we'd
pull into a town and...

28:37.135 --> 28:40.538
Do a show,
sign a couple autographs.

28:40.572 --> 28:45.508
Yeah. All the cowgirls
would line up to meet you.

28:45.543 --> 28:47.877
And all the star-struck boys
in the audience,

28:47.911 --> 28:50.012
just waiting to get
up close and personal

28:50.047 --> 28:52.715
with the miracle girl.

28:52.749 --> 28:55.285
Yeah.
Yeah, it was crazy.

28:56.220 --> 28:58.687
But that's all
in the past.

28:58.721 --> 29:00.622
Doesn't matter.

29:00.656 --> 29:03.325
It's the kind of thing
you remember forever.

29:03.359 --> 29:04.526
You know, I...
I love my wife,

29:04.594 --> 29:07.629
but you'll always be
the one who got away.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.202
I'm gonna go find
your horse.

29:22.111 --> 29:24.012
Hee-ya!

29:24.046 --> 29:25.013
Keep 'em together!

29:25.047 --> 29:26.380
Come on, cows!

29:28.851 --> 29:30.050
You know I haven't even
told Peter

29:30.085 --> 29:32.786
that I'm thinking about
quitting Hubbard yet.

29:32.821 --> 29:33.921
It's just not the kind
of thing that comes up

29:33.955 --> 29:36.389
in casual conversation,
you know?

29:36.424 --> 29:37.424
Hup!

29:37.492 --> 29:38.692
I swear to God, Dad,

29:38.727 --> 29:40.828
all I'd need is like
a couple of good clients.

29:40.895 --> 29:42.329
Yeah,
like Lanny Barrick?

29:42.363 --> 29:43.697
I wish.

29:43.732 --> 29:46.365
That is a big fish to land
for a one-woman start-up.

29:46.399 --> 29:49.268
But maybe if I could
convince Paige.

29:49.302 --> 29:51.037
Jack! Look!

29:52.305 --> 29:54.173
Well, let's go then!

29:54.207 --> 29:55.341
Hee-ya! Hee-ya!

29:59.412 --> 30:01.347
I'll circle around up top.

30:01.381 --> 30:04.650
That little girl
is very good for Grandpa.

30:04.717 --> 30:06.484
He's gonna miss her
when she's gone.

30:06.552 --> 30:09.787
- Lou, stop yakking!
- Give us a hand!

30:09.821 --> 30:10.888
Bring it!

30:11.857 --> 30:12.890
Hee-ya!

30:14.325 --> 30:16.027
Hee-ya, cow! Hee-ya!

30:18.764 --> 30:20.564
Come on, cow! Hup! Hup!

30:21.533 --> 30:23.034
Don't circle them, Lou,

30:23.101 --> 30:25.568
just give 'em
the stink-eye!

30:25.636 --> 30:28.071
Watch and learn, kid.
Hee-ya!

30:29.239 --> 30:31.007
Hup! Hup! Hey, cow!

30:31.075 --> 30:32.275
Hup! Hup! Hup!

30:33.477 --> 30:34.844
Hup! Hee-ya! Hup!

30:35.813 --> 30:37.346
Hee-ya! Come on!

30:39.183 --> 30:40.416
Found your horse.

30:40.450 --> 30:43.052
Uh, look, that stuff
I was talking about earlier,

30:43.119 --> 30:44.452
I just should've kept
my mouth shut.

30:44.487 --> 30:46.254
Yeah, you probably
should've.

30:46.322 --> 30:47.823
The thing is...

30:47.891 --> 30:49.391
Lately, I've been feeling
like a horse

30:49.458 --> 30:50.492
trapped in a stall,

30:50.560 --> 30:51.660
just kicking at the door
to be let out,

30:51.695 --> 30:53.829
and then I see you
and...

30:53.897 --> 30:55.731
Yeah, well, except
this isn't about me.

30:55.765 --> 30:57.098
This is about you
giving up your life

30:57.166 --> 30:58.132
on the open road.

30:58.167 --> 30:59.167
Oh, come on, Amy.

30:59.234 --> 31:00.267
It's not like
I haven't tried, okay?

31:00.302 --> 31:02.737
I met a girl,
I fell in love.

31:02.805 --> 31:05.807
I didn't run away,
I married her.

31:05.841 --> 31:09.443
It could be I wasn't exactly
thinking straight, but...

31:09.477 --> 31:11.245
The thing is,

31:11.313 --> 31:13.279
Hayley wants me
to settle down,

31:13.314 --> 31:15.882
and I don't think
I can.

31:17.852 --> 31:19.586
Them maybe you should be
telling her that

31:19.653 --> 31:21.088
and not me.

31:24.525 --> 31:26.026
Are you sure Jack's okay
with this?

31:26.060 --> 31:27.694
Ah! He's happy
to get rid of it.

31:27.729 --> 31:28.828
Yeah? All right,

31:28.862 --> 31:30.629
well, can you get
the gate?

31:30.697 --> 31:32.898
This fridge is about as old
as the last one I had.

31:32.933 --> 31:33.999
Yes, but it works.

31:34.067 --> 31:35.201
The only thing
this baby's missing

31:35.268 --> 31:37.837
is a nice cold six-pack.

31:38.839 --> 31:40.005
Hey, what the hell's
he doing here?

31:45.111 --> 31:47.011
You know, it's funny.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.679
You talk about me
keeping secrets from my wife,

31:48.748 --> 31:49.881
but the biggest secret here

31:49.915 --> 31:51.549
is that you've still got
a thing for me.

31:51.583 --> 31:53.752
I think I'm the reason
that you didn't marry Ty

31:53.786 --> 31:54.753
when he asked you.

31:54.787 --> 31:56.087
You've gotta be
kidding me.

31:56.122 --> 31:59.991
You think you can hide it,
but not from me.

32:01.059 --> 32:02.893
Don't you ever
do that again!

32:02.927 --> 32:04.294
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I did.

32:05.329 --> 32:07.664
<i>Are you gonna do
something</i> <i>about it?</i>

32:07.698 --> 32:09.833
I think Amy just took
care of that for me.

32:17.599 --> 32:19.065
- Hey, Lou.
- Hey.

32:20.133 --> 32:21.735
About the loan.

32:21.769 --> 32:23.002
It was very,
very sweet of you,

32:23.036 --> 32:24.571
but I can't accept.

32:24.605 --> 32:26.305
What? Why not?

32:26.340 --> 32:27.974
I don't wanna owe you
anything.

32:28.008 --> 32:29.642
It'd make me feel
like a loser.

32:29.677 --> 32:30.844
Caleb,
that is ridiculous.

32:30.878 --> 32:34.013
You are a friend
with a cash-flow problem.

32:34.081 --> 32:35.881
If I take your money,
then you get to judge me

32:35.915 --> 32:38.617
and say things like,
why don't you get a real job.

32:38.651 --> 32:39.918
Come on, Caleb.

32:39.952 --> 32:41.620
Sure,
being a rodeo cowboy

32:41.654 --> 32:42.821
might seem like
a stupid choice,

32:42.856 --> 32:45.391
but it's in my blood,

32:45.425 --> 32:47.760
and you only live once,
so...

32:49.596 --> 32:52.162
Okay.
I'll tell you what...

32:52.197 --> 32:53.765
If you don't wanna
take my money,

32:53.799 --> 32:54.965
there's still a bunch
left to be done

32:55.000 --> 32:56.734
at the Hanley place.

32:56.769 --> 32:58.302
Why don't you come
and pick up some extra work

32:58.370 --> 33:01.439
until you get back
on the circuit.

33:01.507 --> 33:03.207
- Okay.
- All right.

33:03.241 --> 33:04.375
Thanks.

33:18.623 --> 33:21.191
Uh, hi, Martin.
Can you call me back?

33:21.259 --> 33:24.093
Um, I'm hoping we can set up
an appointment.

33:24.161 --> 33:27.030
I'd like to speak to you about
my future with the company.

33:32.803 --> 33:34.737
Are we going somewhere?

33:34.771 --> 33:35.838
No. Uh...

33:37.707 --> 33:39.007
I mean...

33:41.377 --> 33:43.678
Just say it, Chase.

33:43.746 --> 33:44.746
You know I love you

33:44.814 --> 33:46.848
and nothing
can change that.

33:46.916 --> 33:48.616
Well, obviously
something has,

33:48.684 --> 33:50.052
or someone.

33:50.119 --> 33:51.553
But when I went
to pick up Roxy,

33:51.587 --> 33:54.156
I got to talking
to Amy and...

33:55.424 --> 33:57.458
I haven't been exactly
honest with you

33:57.525 --> 34:00.494
about the kind of life
that I wanna live.

34:07.069 --> 34:10.404
Come on, Jack,
I saddled the horses.

34:10.472 --> 34:11.603
What're you doing?

34:11.672 --> 34:14.206
As you can see, I'm busy.

34:15.141 --> 34:17.010
Well, what's this?

34:17.945 --> 34:20.813
That is a woolly worm
wet fly.

34:22.049 --> 34:23.850
A woolly wet worm fly?

34:23.917 --> 34:25.518
That's close enough.

34:25.585 --> 34:29.521
This works best in spots
that are shallow and weedy,

34:29.554 --> 34:30.956
and if you were a trout

34:30.991 --> 34:33.492
you would think
that is irresistible.

34:33.559 --> 34:36.728
Trout? Why are we
talking about trout?

34:36.762 --> 34:38.763
What about the cattle?

34:38.831 --> 34:41.300
Cattle need a day off
now and again.

34:41.333 --> 34:44.402
Besides, my arthritis
is flaring up a bit.

34:44.436 --> 34:45.969
What does that mean?

34:46.038 --> 34:47.405
Well, it means
it might be good day

34:47.438 --> 34:49.373
to learn
how to tie flies.

34:49.440 --> 34:52.176
Okay.
Where do we start?

34:52.210 --> 34:54.411
We start by thinking
like a fish.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.014
You can do that?

34:56.047 --> 34:58.116
Even us dinosaurs have
a couple of tricks

34:58.150 --> 34:59.949
up our sleeves.

35:00.985 --> 35:02.119
What's the matter, honey?

35:02.186 --> 35:03.286
Are you still mad at Mommy?

35:03.321 --> 35:05.622
Hey, Lou!
Glad I caught you.

35:05.656 --> 35:07.024
Hi, Dad.

35:07.058 --> 35:08.492
Because I wouldn't
let you ride the horsey?

35:08.526 --> 35:10.360
Hello, Katie.

35:10.395 --> 35:11.828
Listen, I'm heading over
to Barrick's place -

35:11.862 --> 35:13.263
I gotta teach a couple
of roping lessons -

35:13.297 --> 35:14.398
so I thought maybe
I'd mention

35:14.432 --> 35:16.032
this whole thing
about you going solo...

35:16.066 --> 35:17.666
Dad, thank you,
but it's...

35:17.700 --> 35:20.002
I know you think
I'm meddling again,

35:20.037 --> 35:22.038
but, really,
this is about networking.

35:22.072 --> 35:24.740
This is about people
who know people-

35:24.774 --> 35:26.742
Dad, I've already set up
a pitch meeting,

35:26.776 --> 35:27.776
but thank you anyway.

35:27.844 --> 35:29.711
In fact,
I'm a little bit late.

35:29.746 --> 35:30.779
But, you know,
if you wanna help me

35:30.847 --> 35:33.515
maybe you could
watch Katie for me while I'm gone.

35:33.549 --> 35:34.749
I mean, I'll probably make
a better impression

35:34.783 --> 35:36.351
if I don't have
to drag my baby

35:36.385 --> 35:39.087
to meet prospective
clients, right?

35:39.121 --> 35:40.621
You know,
now that you're a parent,

35:40.656 --> 35:43.024
that you'll do anything
for your kid, right?

35:43.059 --> 35:44.259
Anything.

35:44.293 --> 35:45.793
- Even babysit.
- Yeah.

35:45.827 --> 35:46.994
Okay.
Bye, honey.

35:48.029 --> 35:50.431
- Thanks, dad.
- Okay.

35:54.869 --> 35:56.636
What do you wanna do?

36:00.174 --> 36:01.975
Amy!

36:02.043 --> 36:03.743
Just wanted to drop by
and thank you.

36:03.778 --> 36:05.011
Thank me for what?

36:05.046 --> 36:06.880
For ending my marriage.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.414
Chase just told me he had
a couple of dates lined up

36:08.449 --> 36:10.683
and he didn't know
when he'd be back.

36:10.717 --> 36:11.817
Hayley,
I'm so sorry.

36:11.885 --> 36:12.818
Sorry?!

36:12.886 --> 36:14.252
Sorry doesn't cut it
any more.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.288
He told me
you convinced him to go,

36:16.322 --> 36:18.223
convinced him he's not
the marrying kind.

36:18.257 --> 36:19.825
I never said that!

36:19.893 --> 36:21.093
If that's what
Chase told you,

36:21.127 --> 36:22.360
then he twisted
everything I said.

36:22.395 --> 36:23.495
Well, it sounds pretty
straight forward to me.

36:23.529 --> 36:25.530
It's all about
"Chase Powers' Horsepower"

36:25.598 --> 36:27.164
and his only home
is the open road.

36:27.199 --> 36:29.266
You must've known this
before you married him.

36:29.301 --> 36:31.936
Let me tell you something
about me and Chase.

36:31.971 --> 36:34.973
I would've been happy
with a little barroom fling

36:35.040 --> 36:37.274
with a handsome cowboy.

36:37.342 --> 36:38.876
But he pursued me

36:38.911 --> 36:42.212
until there was nowhere
left to run.

36:42.279 --> 36:45.048
I guess that's why
they call him Chase.

36:45.116 --> 36:47.084
And now you're asking him
to give it all up.

36:47.118 --> 36:48.318
But that's his life.

36:48.385 --> 36:50.087
What about my life?

36:50.154 --> 36:51.287
He said
he wanted a family,

36:51.355 --> 36:52.455
and I said that
the endless touring

36:52.523 --> 36:54.324
was a deal-breaker.

36:54.391 --> 36:57.827
Guess you made him realize
that settling down with me

36:57.894 --> 37:00.295
wasn't much of deal at all.

37:00.330 --> 37:01.731
Asking Chase
to settle down

37:01.765 --> 37:03.699
is like asking him
to retire

37:03.767 --> 37:05.567
when he's just
getting started.

37:05.602 --> 37:06.669
Maybe.

37:07.638 --> 37:08.771
But it doesn't matter now

37:08.839 --> 37:10.006
because I'm here talking
to you

37:10.073 --> 37:12.775
and he's packing up
to go.

37:14.510 --> 37:18.412
Hayley, Chase loves you.
He married you.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.081
Yes, life on the road
can be crazy,

37:20.116 --> 37:23.551
but... sometimes
it can be crazy good.

37:24.920 --> 37:28.356
You just think
I should go with him.

37:28.423 --> 37:31.025
I think it's your decision
to make.

37:36.798 --> 37:39.033
This all looks great,
Lou,

37:40.368 --> 37:41.301
but to tell you
the truth,

37:41.369 --> 37:42.903
I was talking to Lanny

37:42.937 --> 37:44.872
and he's not sure that you
can offer the same service

37:44.939 --> 37:46.372
of a big company.

37:46.439 --> 37:47.940
Yeah. Well,
I like to think of it

37:48.008 --> 37:49.776
as the individualized
attention

37:49.810 --> 37:52.211
of a boutique
investment firm.

37:52.245 --> 37:55.181
So how many clients
do you have?

37:56.150 --> 37:58.317
You would be the first.

37:58.351 --> 38:01.788
Well, I do like being
number one...

38:01.822 --> 38:04.823
But I'm thinking I should
really stick with Hubbard,

38:04.857 --> 38:07.326
and I think
you should too.

38:08.261 --> 38:10.629
Um, I'm sorry,
I'm not following.

38:10.697 --> 38:11.963
It's just that you're
probably gonna wanna

38:11.998 --> 38:13.232
have a couple more kids,

38:13.300 --> 38:14.433
and you'll need to take
mat leave

38:14.501 --> 38:16.101
so you can be
with them.

38:16.135 --> 38:17.670
So maybe when
they're a little older,

38:17.704 --> 38:18.703
then you can leave Hubbard

38:18.737 --> 38:21.972
and start something
of your own.

38:22.007 --> 38:24.008
Right. Okay.

38:24.042 --> 38:29.447
Um, well, thank you
so much for your time,

38:29.481 --> 38:32.217
and, uh, I appreciate
the opportunity.

38:34.785 --> 38:36.119
But frankly,

38:36.153 --> 38:37.721
despite of what you
and Lanny think,

38:37.755 --> 38:40.490
my family plans are
nobody's business.

38:40.525 --> 38:41.891
And as for staying
with Hubbard Financial

38:41.926 --> 38:43.360
for another two years?

38:43.394 --> 38:45.262
Not gonna happen.

38:45.296 --> 38:46.930
I already quit.

38:56.028 --> 38:57.027
Gross.

38:57.062 --> 38:58.629
Die you stupid flies.

38:58.664 --> 38:59.864
Lou, why don't you
let me do that?

38:59.898 --> 39:01.031
No!

39:01.066 --> 39:03.000
If I am gonna work
full-time from home,

39:03.034 --> 39:05.436
I need a workspace that
I actually feel good about.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.140
You've got mail.

39:10.208 --> 39:11.775
Really?

39:11.809 --> 39:14.611
Maybe it's Paige telling me
that she's reconsidered.

39:14.645 --> 39:15.912
Yeah, right.

39:19.149 --> 39:20.383
Hmm.

39:20.417 --> 39:22.051
It's good news?

39:22.086 --> 39:23.653
No... well, sort of.

39:24.856 --> 39:28.023
This toy company wants
to sponsor my blog.

39:28.057 --> 39:29.892
"Play Safe, Play Fair."

39:29.926 --> 39:32.127
That sounds like
a laugh riot.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.797
Influential mommy blogger...

39:34.831 --> 39:36.131
They actually wanna pay me
to the write the stuff

39:36.199 --> 39:38.300
I've already been writing
for free.

39:38.368 --> 39:39.902
Do you know
I was sponsored once.

39:39.970 --> 39:42.037
Longview beef jerky.

39:42.071 --> 39:46.774
There is only so much jerky
a cowboy can eat.

39:46.809 --> 39:47.909
What's wrong?
That's funny,

39:47.977 --> 39:49.177
come on!

39:51.614 --> 39:54.449
This is a good thing,
right?

39:54.517 --> 39:55.817
It's a... yeah.

39:55.885 --> 39:57.986
I mean,
it's an okay thing.

39:58.054 --> 39:59.721
Some toy company wants
to throw a couple bucks

39:59.788 --> 40:01.288
at my blog.

40:01.356 --> 40:04.325
But I can't make a living
as a mommy blogger.

40:04.359 --> 40:07.495
So what do I have to show
for quitting my job and...

40:07.529 --> 40:08.662
Starting out on my own?

40:08.696 --> 40:12.966
Just some
sort of okay news.

40:13.035 --> 40:15.636
Well,
it's not bad news.

40:15.670 --> 40:19.205
I used to have an office...
With a view.

40:19.273 --> 40:21.107
My own parking space.

40:21.175 --> 40:24.044
No dead flies
or spiders.

40:27.314 --> 40:30.517
What if I made
a terrible mistake?

40:30.584 --> 40:33.618
Everything is gonna be
just fine.

40:34.587 --> 40:36.922
Come here,
you need a hug.

40:36.989 --> 40:38.790
Thanks.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.395
It's gonna be all right,
Lou.

41:04.449 --> 41:06.716
Glad I caught you
before you left.

41:06.784 --> 41:09.719
Can you give me a hand
with these?

41:09.753 --> 41:11.521
What're you doing here,
Hayley?

41:11.556 --> 41:14.023
What does it look like?

41:15.460 --> 41:17.194
You sure about this?

41:17.228 --> 41:19.396
I'm willing
to give it a go.

41:19.430 --> 41:21.029
Just remember

41:21.064 --> 41:22.331
that the next time
you got something to say

41:22.399 --> 41:23.432
about our life together,

41:23.467 --> 41:25.267
you say it to me.

41:25.335 --> 41:26.702
I'm the girl you married.

41:26.769 --> 41:29.405
No doubt about that.

41:29.439 --> 41:31.907
What made you
change your mind?

41:31.941 --> 41:33.476
Well, I guess I didn't
have much choice.

41:33.510 --> 41:34.477
This is how you
make your living,

41:34.511 --> 41:37.012
and you gotta work,

41:37.046 --> 41:38.714
especially now.

41:39.649 --> 41:41.950
Now that we're expecting.

41:41.985 --> 41:43.752
You're kidding.

41:43.786 --> 41:46.287
You? Me? A baby?

41:47.957 --> 41:51.093
That's what the test strips
told me.

41:53.394 --> 41:54.461
Woo-hoo!

41:56.865 --> 41:58.865
Wait. Before we get
to celebrating,

41:58.899 --> 42:01.735
there's something
you should know.

42:01.769 --> 42:03.870
I'm not here
because of the baby.

42:03.904 --> 42:07.073
I could raise this baby
with or without you.

42:07.108 --> 42:08.775
I just figured
it'd be more fun

42:08.809 --> 42:10.777
to do it with you.

42:10.811 --> 42:12.879
♪ Tryin' to be man ♪

42:18.452 --> 42:19.852
You know that stove really
doesn't look any different

42:19.886 --> 42:21.287
than the last one.

42:21.321 --> 42:23.989
Well, I just
fixed the burners.

42:24.024 --> 42:25.458
If I had to wait for Caleb
to get me a new one,

42:25.492 --> 42:27.493
I'd be barbecuing
in the middle of winter.

42:27.528 --> 42:31.129
- So, then...
- What's on the menu, hmm?

42:31.197 --> 42:32.730
Um...
How 'bout a little...

42:32.765 --> 42:34.098
Mm...
Mm-hmm.

42:37.903 --> 42:39.638
Hey...

42:39.672 --> 42:42.006
Ty, there's something
I should probably tell you.

42:42.041 --> 42:44.042
It's about Chase.

42:45.144 --> 42:46.277
Is this another
guessing game?

42:46.344 --> 42:47.911
'Cause I think
I already know the answer.

42:47.945 --> 42:49.246
You do?

42:49.281 --> 42:50.347
He kissed you.

42:50.382 --> 42:52.049
I saw pretty much
the whole thing.

42:52.116 --> 42:54.017
You saw him kiss me?

42:54.085 --> 42:55.152
Yeah, I was gonna
hammer him,

42:55.187 --> 42:56.320
but then you sort of
took care of it

42:56.388 --> 42:58.556
all by yourself,
so...

42:58.623 --> 42:59.856
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:00.592 --> 43:03.092
I can't believe you just
stood there and watched it.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.561
You didn't even
say a word.

43:04.628 --> 43:06.896
Believe me,
I was going to do something,

43:06.963 --> 43:08.898
but then you had
the situation handled

43:08.965 --> 43:11.467
so there wasn't really much
left for me to do.

43:12.735 --> 43:14.404
You got that right.

43:19.609 --> 43:21.543
Okay. I got a couple of rules.

43:21.611 --> 43:22.844
Shoot.

43:22.912 --> 43:25.113
<i>No cheap motels,</i>
<i>no bad road food,</i>

43:25.147 --> 43:27.649
<i>and when I say we're stopping,</i>
<i>we're stopping.</i>

43:27.717 --> 43:29.585
<i>Whether we need gas</i>
<i>or not.</i>

43:29.652 --> 43:31.687
That's right, cowboy.
