The tumor is malignant.

I'm afraid you only have six months

00:42.793 --> 00:46.463
Listen up, everybody.
Your Grandpa Griffin is finally retiring.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.840
Grandpa Griffin?

00:47.923 --> 00:52.344
Is he the one that smells like firewood
and has big gray pussywillows in his ears?

00:52.427 --> 00:55.430
Chris, that's a terrible word.
"Pussywillows."

00:55.889 --> 00:59.852
My dad worked at that mill for 60 years.
That's almost 80 years.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.605
Tomorrow we'll all go
to a big dinner to honor him.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.482
Why? We barely know him.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.401
Yeah. How come he never visits us?

01:07.484 --> 01:10.737
Kids, your grandfather has never been
comfortable with the fact...

01:10.821 --> 01:12.698
...that I'm not Catholic.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.158
[Church bells ringing]

01:21.123 --> 01:24.209
Dad loves all of us.
He's just too busy working to show it.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.003
He's been that way since I was a kid.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.922
And now the winners of
the father-son three-legged race.

01:29.006 --> 01:33.343
First place, Bobby Hammill and his dad.
Second place, Jimmy Lawson and his dad.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.847
Third place,
Peter Griffin and a stalk of corn.

01:38.015 --> 01:41.226
Now that he's retiring,
we can finally spend some time together.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.271
I want us to have one of those
father-son moments, like on TV.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.857
Where we hug and the music goes...

[Band playing sentimental music]

01:49.026 --> 01:50.611
Thanks, boys. Just like that.

01:50.694 --> 01:54.323
Can you do that fluttery thing like
when the Brady kids run down the stairs?

01:55.157 --> 01:57.701
[Band playing fluttery music]

01:58.619 --> 02:00.120
I don't want to tattle.

[Trombone sputtering]

02:14.968 --> 02:18.138
Mom, I can't eat.
I'm too grossed out by Grandpa's ears.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.683
I know.
They're like a big, gray enchanted forest.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.269
Kids, your grandfather's ears
are not gross.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.939
And they are certainly not
an enchanted forest.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.074
[High-pitched noise]

02:37.616 --> 02:41.203
But seriously, tonight
we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate...

02:41.286 --> 02:45.249
...the career of our oldest and
most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.458
Francis.

[Applause]

02:48.377 --> 02:49.378
[Whistling]

02:52.130 --> 02:53.507
At mass this morning...

02:53.590 --> 02:56.844
...it occurred to me that I may never see
any of your faces again.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.012
I just want to say that Jesus loves you.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.516
But in my eyes,
you're a bunch of sinners and slackers...

03:02.599 --> 03:04.977
...who forced a hard-working
old man to retire.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.729
So you can take this shiny watch
and shove it.

03:07.813 --> 03:08.814
[Gasping]

03:08.897 --> 03:10.315
I adore this man!

03:13.277 --> 03:14.987
That was some speech, Dad.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.781
Yeah. It's a shame Grandma
wasn't there to hear it.

03:17.865 --> 03:21.451
Bless her heart. She's on another one
of her prayer missions in Las Vegas.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.996
Hit me, you five-card stud.

Cocktail!

03:28.083 --> 03:29.751
Aye, she's a rose.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.714
It's a pity you couldn't find yourself
a nice Irish Catholic girl, Peter.

03:34.506 --> 03:37.426
Francis, this must be embarrassing
for you.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.094
I'm in the car.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.638
Now that you're retired, you're
coming to stay with us.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.099
No more excuses.
I'm putting my foot down.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.225
[Brakes screeching]

03:45.309 --> 03:47.644
Brian, buckle up. What do you say, Dad?

03:47.728 --> 03:50.939
-I don't want to be a bother.
-It's no bother, is it, Lois?

03:51.273 --> 03:53.692
Of course not. It'll be fun.

03:54.026 --> 03:57.654
You're a good woman, Lois.
Perhaps you won't burn in Hell after all.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.866
Maybe you'll just go to purgatory
with all the unbaptized babies.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.868
There you go, Lois. You love kids.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.538
Look at that.

04:06.622 --> 04:10.584
Dad's reading Stewie to sleep,
just like he never did for me.

04:11.043 --> 04:15.714
"So God cast the pagans and sinners
into the fiery bowels of Hell...

04:15.839 --> 04:19.593
"...where their flesh burned in agony
forever and ever."

04:20.219 --> 04:21.470
The end.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.724
Children love a good bedtime story
from the Bible.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.769
Yes, charming.
Like when God told Abraham to kill Isaac.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.481
Hey!

04:38.820 --> 04:41.323
That was a lovely service, Francis.

04:41.532 --> 04:44.368
Super. And only
three more hours till school.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.079
I didn't even know there was
a 5:00 a.m. mass.

04:47.162 --> 04:50.999
I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m.
What else haven't you told me?

04:51.416 --> 04:55.003
I rather like this God fellow.
He's very theatrical, you know.

04:55.254 --> 04:58.340
A pestilence here and a plague there.
Omnipotence!

04:58.423 --> 04:59.967
Got to get me some of that.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.095
Yes. We all enjoy the Bible in this house.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.889
Really? What's your favorite book
of the Bible?

05:07.349 --> 05:09.768
That one where Jesus swallows
the puzzle piece...

05:09.852 --> 05:13.522
...and the man in the big yellow hat
has to take him to the hospital.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.148

[Toilet flushes]

05:18.694 --> 05:19.987
Sorry, Grandpa.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.906
You might want to give that
a minute or two.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.450
I know what you're doing in there,
and it's a sin!

05:25.534 --> 05:28.036
If you ever do it again,
you'll burn in Hell!

05:28.328 --> 05:30.873
But I do it every day. Sometimes twice.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.374
Mark my words, lad.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.793
You may think you're alone,
but God's watching.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.587
Don't do it again!

05:36.837 --> 05:39.131
God's watching me do number two?

05:39.381 --> 05:41.925
I'm a sinner, and God's a pervert.

How was school?

05:48.056 --> 05:50.225
Good. Kevin walked me home.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.686
-Kevin?
-He lives next door.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.272
He lives next door to a harlot!

05:55.397 --> 05:57.399
Grandpa, we were just holding hands.

05:57.566 --> 06:01.570
It'll be easy for him to take your hand
when God strikes your heart with leprosy.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.364
He can take it right home with him!

I'll tell you how it ends.
Laura burns the roast...

around in those pants!

[Baseball field organ music playing]

06:41.360 --> 06:45.239
Yeah, not a bad way to kick off
your retirement, huh, Dad?

06:45.822 --> 06:49.409
Yeah, the magic of baseball has brought
fathers and sons together...

06:49.493 --> 06:51.495
...for millions of years.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.039
Stewie's having fun.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.834
Why does that man drop his club
before he runs around?

06:56.917 --> 06:58.544
I would bring it with me.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.504
Hey, who wants a Fenway frank?

07:00.587 --> 07:04.383
Nothing says, "Please talk to me, Daddy,"
like a Fenway frank.

07:04.716 --> 07:08.220
Is there a bathroom here?
I don't think I can wait anymore.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.556
In a public restroom, lad?

07:10.806 --> 07:13.350
For the good of your soul,
show some restraint.

07:14.268 --> 07:15.644
Hey, hot dog guy!

07:15.727 --> 07:16.812
I'll get him.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.564
Oh, no, Dad, they bring them to you.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.942
Well, la-de-da.
I don't need my food brought to me.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.528
I'm not a broken-down old mule!
I can still work!

07:24.611 --> 07:26.363
I can still take orders!

07:26.446 --> 07:28.198
Oh, hey! Hey, look! Hey, Dad!

07:31.034 --> 07:32.911
Aw, crap. That was money well-spent.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.415
He just left without saying anything?
Where would he go?

07:36.498 --> 07:39.751
I don't know. I asked him to buy me
some peanuts and cracker jacks.

07:39.835 --> 07:41.837
I don't care if he ever gets back.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.464

will be examined, this cock.

is sponsoring free check-ups...

07:57.269 --> 08:00.981
...for this year's Cock Awareness Week.
I don't know why the suggestive name.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.483
They could've just as easily
gone with "rooster."

08:03.692 --> 08:05.903
I'm telling you.
Something must've happened to him.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.656
He's probably hurt, or lost,
or shanghaied by pirates!

He's okay! Thank God!

COP: It seems he broke into the old mill
after hours.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.060

08:38.143 --> 08:41.230
Dad, you left the ball game with me
to go work in a mill?

08:41.313 --> 08:44.024
Yes! I want to work! I want my job back!

08:44.107 --> 08:45.692
But, Dad, you're retired.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.319
I'd rather be dead.

08:47.444 --> 08:51.406
I'll tell you what's dead. Vaudeville.
You know what killed it? Talkie pictures.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.784
But you can still make it.
You just need a gimmick.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.245
I, for one, am a tumbler.
Here, watch my round-off.

08:56.328 --> 09:00.165
Hey, be a sport. Take the pills out of
my pocket and put one under my tongue.

09:04.253 --> 09:07.756
I don't get it, Lois. Baseball's always
been the secret to male bonding.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.510
It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell
and his father in A League of Their Own.

09:11.593 --> 09:12.719
I hate to say this...

09:12.803 --> 09:16.306
...but it doesn't seem like your dad
is interested in bonding with you.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.433
All he cares about is work.

09:18.517 --> 09:21.562
Wait a second. Work!
That's what'll bring us together.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.480
We can start our own father-son business.

[Theme from Sanford & Son]

09:25.190 --> 09:28.569
What are you doing with all them
bathtubs, you heathen dummy?

09:28.652 --> 09:30.445
Pop, why you gotta be like that?

09:30.529 --> 09:34.366
We cut 'em in half, stick a Virgin Mary
in them and sell them as shrines.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.619
That's my boy. At least,
that's what your mama always told me.

09:37.703 --> 09:40.497
Now give me a hug before I give you
a knuckle sandwich.

09:42.165 --> 09:46.253
Or you could just get your father a job
with you at the toy factory.

09:46.461 --> 09:49.381
That's an even better idea!
Lois, you're a genius.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.384
Now give me a hug
before I give you a knuckle sandwich.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.387
LOIS: Peter, I can't hug you.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.389
Cut it out. I'm serious.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.228
And this is the nerve center
of the whole factory, my station.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.440
I assemble our new action figure,
Zeke, the moody drifter.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.943
You mean to tell me
you stand here all day playing with dolls?

10:10.694 --> 10:13.572
It's not easy.
See, I gotta twist on his head...

10:13.655 --> 10:16.575

in his torn denim jacket.

Listen, I was wondering if you might
have a job for my dad.

10:30.088 --> 10:33.050
Your father?
He must be a man of at least 70.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.386
Oh, yeah. But he's in great shape.
Except his prostate.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.973

a horse was using the bathroom.

I've never seen such productivity.
How is this possible?

10:51.235 --> 10:52.945
I'll tell you how it's possible.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.948
Because this man always put his job
before everything else.

Still at the factory.
He's turning the break room into a chapel.

11:54.006 --> 11:56.175
A chapel? Where will you all eat lunch?

11:56.592 --> 11:59.511
Lois, lunch is a sin.
Taking a break is a sin.

Bestiality is a sin.
