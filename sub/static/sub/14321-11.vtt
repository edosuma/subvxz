WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:02.750
[narrator] Previously on
X-Men...

00:03.291 --> 00:07.500
Here is
the Axis of Time,
where all times cross.

00:07.500 --> 00:11.000
Apocalypse seems bent
on mastering time itself,

00:11.458 --> 00:15.333
and has persuaded some of
the most powerful mutants
on Earth to help him.

00:15.958 --> 00:17.958
[Cable] It's called
the Lazarus Chamber.

00:18.458 --> 00:21.458
It's the secret
to Apocalypse's
longevity.

00:21.458 --> 00:25.750
I'm going back to when
the pyramid was first built
and get rid of it then.

00:25.750 --> 00:29.083
[Cyclops] Wait a minute.
What about Sinister and
the missing psychics?

00:29.333 --> 00:32.416
I don't care
about missing psychics
and time jolts.

00:32.416 --> 00:34.458
I'm after Apocalypse.

00:34.458 --> 00:37.625
If you want
to help me nail him,
get your team together,

00:37.625 --> 00:39.000
and let's get started.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.583
The Four Horsemen.
Apocalypse has
protected himself.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.458
[Cyclops] Go get Apocalypse.
We can hold these guys here.

00:51.708 --> 00:52.875
[groans]

00:54.458 --> 00:56.625
Hey, pal, leave a few
of them for us.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.875
The Lazarus Chamber.
It's in there.

01:00.458 --> 01:04.208
Now, let's find Apocalypse
and do what we came to do.

01:04.708 --> 01:06.250
[Wolverine]
Wait! [sniffing]

01:06.250 --> 01:08.458
I smell two
rats in this barn.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.583
Now, Apocalypse!

01:11.333 --> 01:12.500
[all screaming]

01:14.583 --> 01:16.625
Xavier? Wolverine?

01:16.958 --> 01:18.583
What happened?

01:18.583 --> 01:20.000
[Mystique gasps]

01:20.000 --> 01:21.333
What was that?

01:21.333 --> 01:23.958
The most important move
of all.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.375
The capture of the king.

01:26.375 --> 01:29.333
Professor Charles Xavier.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.458
[theme music playing]

02:35.375 --> 02:37.875
Yoo-hoo! Going my way?
[laughs]

02:38.625 --> 02:39.708
[Bishop] Step aside.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.583
Step aside, step right up,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.833
step on a crack,
break your mama's back.

02:43.833 --> 02:48.000
Step on a dime,
you'll be here
for all time!

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
[giggles]

03:09.750 --> 03:10.750
He knew!

03:11.458 --> 03:13.083
Apocalypse knew
your stupid plan

03:13.083 --> 03:14.875
before we made
our first move.

03:15.583 --> 03:18.708
Maybe. You got
any other ideas,
I'm listening.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.958
You don't, get out of here,
'cause this little health spa
is history.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.750
[beeping]

03:26.750 --> 03:27.750
Move it.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.958
[Beast] We must assume
Professor Xavier
and Wolverine

03:51.958 --> 03:56.208
have been taken to
the same place, or time,
as the kidnapped psychics.

03:56.208 --> 03:57.833
So, we're back
where we started.

03:58.125 --> 03:59.458
Not entirely.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.708
Professor Xavier knew
there was a danger
of his capture

04:02.708 --> 04:06.000
and wore
a pulse generator,
a sort of homing device.

04:06.291 --> 04:09.416
Cerebro and Graymalkin,
working together,
can help find him.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.125
And, unless I am mistaken,
Graymalkincan take us there.

04:13.583 --> 04:14.750
Let's do it.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.875
[Apocalypse] Fool!
Now that I exist
in the Axis,

04:27.208 --> 04:28.875
I need no resuscitation.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.958
The destruction of
my Lazarus Chamber
can no longer harm me.

04:33.833 --> 04:37.833
A pathetic waste of time.
And time, my friends,

04:37.833 --> 04:40.583
is the greatest
power in existence.

04:40.583 --> 04:45.416
Unfortunately for you
and your universe,
time has run out.

04:46.625 --> 04:49.125
[Cable]
It appears Graymalkin
and Cerebro are having

04:49.125 --> 04:51.458
quite a conversation
about your professor.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.458
[Cerebro]
All analyzes confirm
partial temporal trajectory.

04:55.708 --> 04:59.000
Partial trajectory?
Does this mean his voyage
was interrupted?

04:59.583 --> 05:03.583
Computer, was Xavier's
time travel path
obstructed in any way?

05:03.875 --> 05:07.291
[Graymalkin] Negative.
Temporal voyager
Charles Xavier reached

05:07.291 --> 05:08.875
his programmed destination.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.416
What destination?

05:10.708 --> 05:14.500
Between time. The Nexus.
The Axis of Time.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.375
Charles Xavier exists
outside of time.

05:17.708 --> 05:20.416
Outside of time?
Cable?

05:23.416 --> 05:24.833
Cable, respond.

05:34.708 --> 05:37.083
And now it begins.

05:40.833 --> 05:41.875
[Wolverine] Jean!

05:44.166 --> 05:46.875
What are you
doing with her,
you pile of dog puke?

05:47.708 --> 05:50.208
[Apocalypse]
Soon you will wish
you had not leaped through

05:50.208 --> 05:52.000
the portal
after your professor.

05:53.416 --> 05:57.208
I have let you live
to witness the obliteration

05:57.208 --> 05:59.166
of all you hold dear.

05:59.458 --> 06:02.416
Knowing you can do
nothing to save it.

06:09.833 --> 06:12.708
Just when I thought this place
couldn't get any weirder.

06:12.875 --> 06:15.291
[Bender] Ha!
You don't know
the half of it.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.875
It's not nice to fool
with the Axis of Time.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.458
Who else is here?
What aren't you
telling me?

06:21.625 --> 06:23.125
You've got something
on your shirt.

06:23.125 --> 06:24.833
Made you look. [laughs]

06:24.833 --> 06:26.375
Made you look.

06:26.375 --> 06:27.458
Enough!

06:31.125 --> 06:33.291
He's stealing time.

06:33.291 --> 06:34.750
Stealing time?

06:35.583 --> 06:38.125
All shall soon be in place.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.458
Wait. You said you
would explain.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.708
If you insist, Magneto.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.708
We have a few minutes
before the psychics
are in position.

06:49.291 --> 06:50.333
Follow me.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.458
[Apocalypse] Time is motion,
and motion and thought
are a unity.

07:00.166 --> 07:04.000
Two aspects of
a single power that is
beyond comprehension

07:04.000 --> 07:06.208
to all but myself.

07:06.208 --> 07:10.166
That is why
certain psychics
can see into the future.

07:10.458 --> 07:13.125
The mind can
transcend time.

07:13.458 --> 07:16.458
You still haven't answered
my question, Apocalypse.

07:16.708 --> 07:17.833
What happens next?

07:18.208 --> 07:20.458
Throughout the centuries,

07:20.458 --> 07:23.875
an elemental balance
of power, of good and evil,

07:23.875 --> 07:26.750
has always denied
me final victory.

07:27.291 --> 07:28.500
Until now!

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
For I have discovered
a way to break that balance.

07:33.458 --> 07:35.750
By simultaneously destroying

07:35.750 --> 07:39.166
the most powerful
psychic beings
in the universe.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.458
Like atoms
being smashed,

07:41.708 --> 07:45.458
their destruction
shall release a force
of psychic energy

07:45.458 --> 07:48.458
powerful enough
to stop the Axis.

07:48.458 --> 07:52.083
To stop time itself.

07:54.416 --> 07:59.416
And so
it shall come to pass
that all existence will end,

07:59.875 --> 08:04.833
except that which
is here within the Axis,
outside time.

08:05.125 --> 08:07.833
Then shall I begin anew,

08:07.833 --> 08:12.000
recreating the universe
in my own image,

08:12.000 --> 08:17.833
a perfect universe,
where I shall rule,
unchallenged!

08:18.208 --> 08:22.083
When you sought my help,
you said nothing about
this madness.

08:22.708 --> 08:24.500
You spoke of creating
an alternate future

08:24.500 --> 08:28.458
in which mutants would rule,
as I have always dreamed.

08:28.458 --> 08:31.375
And you were fool enough
to believe me.

08:31.708 --> 08:34.125
Strike him down,
my Horsemen!

08:36.750 --> 08:38.375
What?

08:39.375 --> 08:40.958
[screaming] No!

08:43.375 --> 08:45.750
I never believed you,
Apocalypse.

08:51.958 --> 08:53.625
I am not a fool.

08:55.875 --> 09:00.750
Traitors. You dare
to attack your master?

09:03.500 --> 09:05.583
I call no one master.

09:05.875 --> 09:09.583
Especially not one who would
destroy the innocent
along with the guilty.

09:10.708 --> 09:13.583
Spare me your
petty judgments.

09:13.583 --> 09:18.000
They spring from
a brain too meager
to comprehend my reality.

09:18.250 --> 09:21.458
Now taste the power
of Apocalypse!

09:21.708 --> 09:23.833
[Magneto] It is poisonous.

09:25.125 --> 09:26.250
[screams]

09:27.208 --> 09:30.458
[screaming] No!

09:38.708 --> 09:43.583
Tsk, tsk.
You children have
been very naughty.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.291
[Magneto]
Hear me, Sinister.

09:45.833 --> 09:49.208
I suspected Apocalypse
was merely using us.

09:49.208 --> 09:53.083
I'd planned to destroy him
once I learned the nature
of his power.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.375
I was going to
use that power

09:55.833 --> 09:58.458
to build the future
I have always dreamed of.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.750
Now, if you wish to live,

10:02.458 --> 10:05.708
show me how to stop
what Apocalypse has started.

10:05.708 --> 10:08.458
I knew of Apocalypse's plan
all along.

10:08.750 --> 10:13.458
Being part of
recreating existence
appealed to me.

10:13.875 --> 10:17.708
And betraying Apocalypse
is truly a fool's game.

10:17.708 --> 10:21.291
Infidels! Defilers!

10:21.291 --> 10:24.291
No one can stop what
I have put into motion.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.583
The psychics
are all in place.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.083
Sinister, destroy them!

10:29.416 --> 10:32.583
With pleasure. Vertigo?

10:33.958 --> 10:35.291
[grunting]

10:43.458 --> 10:45.166
We can't handle all of them.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.208
You are right.
We must try to free

10:47.208 --> 10:49.083
Wolverine and the psychics.

10:53.875 --> 10:56.333
Go. I'll try to
buy us some time.

11:06.958 --> 11:10.000
[Magneto]
Apocalypse is going
to obliterate existence.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.875
You must help me stop him.

11:11.875 --> 11:13.583
Are you talking to me?

11:14.458 --> 11:16.208
I thought you two were pals.

11:22.208 --> 11:24.125
Hey, you ain't kidding.

11:24.458 --> 11:27.500
Hold them off. I'm busting
the psychics out of
those chambers.

11:27.708 --> 11:28.958
[groans]

11:28.958 --> 11:30.458
Magneto, behind you!

11:31.208 --> 11:32.333
[grunts]

11:38.625 --> 11:40.291
[Ruckus screaming]

11:40.291 --> 11:43.708
Ruckus has a way with words,
does he not?

11:49.625 --> 11:53.083
Well, well,
looky who's here.

11:54.458 --> 11:55.708
[Wolverine grunts]

12:00.583 --> 12:01.708
Where am I?

12:02.625 --> 12:05.708
Your final resting place.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.416
[groaning]

12:09.125 --> 12:11.875
Enough of these
petty interruptions.

12:12.375 --> 12:13.375
Horsemen!

12:22.500 --> 12:25.416
[Apocalypse]
The end has begun.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.333
[Jean] Professor?
What's happening?

12:27.708 --> 12:29.458
[Xavier]
I do not know, Jean.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.875
I feel my psychic energy
being drained.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.208
[rumbling]

12:45.250 --> 12:46.500
[people shouting]

12:46.500 --> 12:47.875
[screaming]

12:58.375 --> 13:00.166
[Shard] We're fading away!

13:10.250 --> 13:12.708
[Apocalypse] Behold
what I have wrought.

13:14.125 --> 13:17.291
By harnessing the power
of psychic energy,

13:17.583 --> 13:20.833
the lines of time
have begun to recede.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.833
Time portals disappear.

13:26.500 --> 13:30.708
What once was
now will never be.

13:32.458 --> 13:36.833
What will be,
I shall determine.

13:38.166 --> 13:42.000
Moments in time
lost forever.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.000
The road's
drying up behind us.

13:47.458 --> 13:50.583
It's all unraveling.
Apocalypse tugged
at the string.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.583
Tug, tug, tug! Oh, that guy!

13:52.583 --> 13:55.375
Apocalypse? What does
he have to do with it?

13:55.708 --> 13:58.000
Oh, nothing much.
He's just screwing around

13:58.000 --> 14:00.625
with the whole
space-time continuum.

14:00.625 --> 14:03.000
How's a joker
like you know this?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.833
Because I built
this place, I think.

14:06.416 --> 14:08.708
It was so long ago,
I forgot. [laughs]

14:09.000 --> 14:11.583
Well, it all goes
in one ear and out
the other. [laughing]

14:11.583 --> 14:14.083
Anyhoo, I take care
of things,

14:14.083 --> 14:16.333
you know, a little dusting,
an occasional mop.

14:16.583 --> 14:19.000
You mean
you're the janitor?

14:19.000 --> 14:22.458
Please. I prefer the term
custodial engineer.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.083
You wouldn't believe
the dust that can pile up
in 14 billion years,

14:26.083 --> 14:29.250
not to mention
the waxy build-up.
I could tell you stories.

14:29.250 --> 14:33.458
Just tell me how to keep
this place from unraveling,
or I'll start blasting.

14:33.458 --> 14:34.625
Like this?

14:39.416 --> 14:42.500
Wait a minute.
I haven't seen
that blue ring before.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.458
I bet it's part of all this.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.083
Psylocke! What's going on?

14:52.750 --> 14:55.000
The others,
you must free them.

14:55.458 --> 14:56.458
You got it.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.458
[Apocalypse]
The psychic energy
is ebbing.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.875
The Axis
is returning to normal.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.958
Someone's out there.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.583
Easy. Gotta go
help the others.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.083
How dare you? My work!

15:25.083 --> 15:27.583
A thousand years
of searching.

15:27.875 --> 15:32.125
Annihilate him,
and recapture
the freed psychics.

15:32.458 --> 15:36.291
Four against one, huh?
I like the odds.

15:39.416 --> 15:43.000
One man, small
and alone, remains,

15:43.000 --> 15:47.250
defending the universe.
If only he knew.

15:49.208 --> 15:52.833
Two small men, Sinister.
Now, one of you jerks

15:52.833 --> 15:55.333
is gonna get
Jean and Xavier
out of those cylinders.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.833
Not this time, X-Man!

15:57.833 --> 15:59.083
[screams]

15:59.583 --> 16:02.250
That orb
controlled the psychics.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.458
You don't know
what you've done.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.000
You ain't seen nothing yet.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
[rumbling]

16:07.000 --> 16:08.416
[screaming]

16:08.416 --> 16:10.000
What's going on?

16:32.333 --> 16:35.458
No! I will not be denied!

16:36.958 --> 16:39.166
What's the matter, tough guy?

16:39.166 --> 16:40.625
Hard to keep good help?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.333
Let us depart,
while we still can.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.458
They're getting away.

16:49.333 --> 16:52.416
Forget about them.
I'm going after
my people.

16:52.416 --> 16:53.958
-You find Apocalypse.
-[grunts]

16:54.625 --> 16:58.458
You have traveled
over 50 centuries
of time to stop me.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.833
When will you learn
it cannot be done?

17:01.833 --> 17:03.875
Guess I'm a slow learner.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.250
[Screams]

17:10.125 --> 17:11.958
[Mystique groaning]

17:17.416 --> 17:19.458
That's some
fancy shooting, Cable.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.458
Really brought
the house down.

17:24.416 --> 17:25.583
Look out!

17:31.583 --> 17:34.500
My beautiful fortress!

17:34.500 --> 17:37.250
You shall all be
interred within it.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.375
Incoming. Stay down.

17:48.375 --> 17:50.875
I am going after Apocalypse.

17:51.250 --> 17:55.833
Do what you will,
for I fear no one.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.208
[grunts]

17:58.291 --> 18:00.208
[grunting]

18:00.208 --> 18:02.333
Oh, look who I'm saving.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.083
You'd think I was Xavier.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.833
Come on,
Mr. Change-the-universe.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.708
Let's see if you can
handle just one X-Man.

18:14.125 --> 18:15.458
[screaming]

18:20.375 --> 18:24.000
Look who I'm saving.
You'd think I were
an X-Man.

18:27.208 --> 18:31.000
I'm losing my powers.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.125
[Apocalypse] I have spent
a dozen lifetimes in the Axis,

18:34.125 --> 18:36.750
learning to master
its powers.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.625
I will not be denied.

18:40.708 --> 18:41.833
Huh?

18:42.458 --> 18:45.000
Somebody needed
to shut that guy up.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.000
[Cable] Good timing, Bishop.

18:48.500 --> 18:53.458
Do you not realize
I am immortal?

18:54.000 --> 18:58.500
[Xavier] Apocalypse,
time and thought are one.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.250
That's why,
now that we are free,

19:01.250 --> 19:03.833
our power here
is greater than yours.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.250
You will exit
the Axis with us.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.750
Outside the protection
of the Axis,

19:13.750 --> 19:15.583
with your
Lazarus Chamber gone,

19:15.583 --> 19:18.750
you will simply
cease to exist.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.458
The end of time for you.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.958
[screaming] No!

19:33.833 --> 19:35.708
Leaving so soon?

19:35.708 --> 19:38.250
[clicking tongue]
And such a mess.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.000
[laughing]

19:51.875 --> 19:56.583
Bishop! You big ox!
You sure know
how to make me worry.

19:56.583 --> 19:58.166
I wish
I'd been there to help.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.458
I don't know why,
but I was concerned about you.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.416
I was afraid
I'd never see you again.

20:04.416 --> 20:07.375
We don't seem
to have much luck
with honeymoons, do we?

20:07.625 --> 20:10.458
We have accomplished
a great victory this day.

20:10.875 --> 20:14.166
Did it feel so odd, Magnus,
working together?

20:14.166 --> 20:15.583
No, Charles.

20:15.875 --> 20:18.125
Perhaps if we could
start the world over,

20:18.458 --> 20:20.583
it would be possible again.

20:20.583 --> 20:22.125
Well, you have destroyed

20:22.125 --> 20:25.125
what you considered
the incarnation of evil.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.458
Do you think the world
has been changed?

20:27.458 --> 20:30.958
Right now, Beast,
I really don't care.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.000
I just want to go home.

20:36.708 --> 20:38.583
[Cable] Thanks, Graymalkin.

20:38.583 --> 20:43.083
Now take me back
to a week before
I left, to my son.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
