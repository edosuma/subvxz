WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.537
Last time on
Make It Pop!

00:03.571 --> 00:04.972
Wow, amazing!

00:05.005 --> 00:07.741
It actually looks
like a club.

00:07.775 --> 00:10.478
Caleb: So, are we a
band, or what?

00:10.511 --> 00:12.313
Valerie: Ever consider
joining the Spirit Squad?

00:12.346 --> 00:13.881
Oh, no thanks.

00:13.914 --> 00:16.284
I do not like those girls.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.686
* We're gonna
party, tonight *

00:20.354 --> 00:21.222
They seem nice.

00:27.995 --> 00:28.762
We're dead!

00:28.796 --> 00:30.030
Never good showing
up a Spirit girl

00:30.064 --> 00:31.732
in front of the
entire school.

00:31.765 --> 00:32.733
What's the big deal?

00:32.766 --> 00:34.034
You danced well,
she danced well.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.303
How mad can she be?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.004
This is a
high school, Corki.

00:37.037 --> 00:37.971
We're the hot
new thing.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.074
That's our whole world,
you just dumped on.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.343
Do we really have time
for all this drama?

00:42.376 --> 00:43.411
Corki's right.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.513
Yeah, with her brains,
your talent, and my looks,

00:45.546 --> 00:47.981
We'll have the whole
school not talking to us,

00:48.015 --> 00:49.283
by the end
of the semester.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.118
Fuuuuuun!

00:50.151 --> 00:51.819
(schoolbell rings)

00:51.852 --> 00:53.121
That's not fun.

00:53.154 --> 00:59.360
*

01:06.167 --> 01:07.835
Why are you
searching me online?

01:07.868 --> 01:09.137
(screams)

01:10.338 --> 01:12.773
You can't just sneak
up on people like that.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.907
It's not polite.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.309
And spying on me is?

01:15.343 --> 01:16.344
I'm not spying.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.779
I'm just trying to create
a buzz for the band

01:18.812 --> 01:21.349
and I can't do that unless,
I know something about you.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.951
So what did you find?

01:23.984 --> 01:26.820
"Corki Chang is a girl."

01:26.854 --> 01:28.289
Good detective work.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.558
Sun-Hi, you don't have
permission to post my bio

01:30.591 --> 01:31.992
or investigate my life.

01:32.025 --> 01:32.793
Come on.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.129
If you have
questions, just ask.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.397
Fine, where
were you born?

01:36.430 --> 01:36.964
Can't tell you.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.166
What's your family like?

01:38.199 --> 01:38.932
Can't tell you.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.901
Why are you being
such a diva?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.035
Me?

01:42.069 --> 01:44.338
You're the one who has a shirt
that says, "I'm a diva".

01:44.372 --> 01:46.006
I do like that shirt.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.175
Ugh!

01:47.208 --> 01:49.042
Corki, you're
so mysterious!

01:49.076 --> 01:50.811
Friends share
stuff with each other!

01:50.844 --> 01:53.514
Which is why I'm wearing
your shoes right now.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.982
(screams)

01:55.015 --> 01:56.217
You're impossible!

02:02.356 --> 02:04.325
She's hiding something.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.126
And I'm gonna
find out what.

02:06.160 --> 02:11.199
*

02:11.232 --> 02:18.239
* Make it pop! Woo, woo

02:18.272 --> 02:22.910
* I can't wait, no

02:22.943 --> 02:24.178
* I can't wait

02:24.212 --> 02:25.879
* So make it pop!

02:25.913 --> 02:27.948
* We're bout to,
were bout to blow! *

02:27.981 --> 02:29.317
* Until we drop!

02:29.350 --> 02:31.319
* Oh yeah, we're ready to go

02:31.352 --> 02:32.586
* Ain't gonna stop!

02:32.620 --> 02:35.055
* When is it time
for the show? *

02:35.088 --> 02:37.358
* We make it,
you make it, they make it*

02:37.391 --> 02:40.060
* M-m-m-m-m-make it pop!

02:42.029 --> 02:43.897
*

02:43.931 --> 02:45.032
Alright, so it goes,

02:45.065 --> 02:48.902
arms up, and switch, grab
your head, circle around,

02:48.936 --> 02:50.871
bounce, bounce.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.406
Got it?

02:52.440 --> 02:53.407
Yep!

02:53.441 --> 02:57.411
I stand in the middle of
the stage and look good.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.079
Close enough.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.581
Corki, don't be shy.

03:00.614 --> 03:04.184
If you feel like adding
something, go ahead and try it.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.953
Okay, let's take
it from the top.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.621
(laughing)

03:09.957 --> 03:12.960
5- 6- 7- 8.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.929
* Let's come together

03:15.963 --> 03:20.368
* We'll build it up
and make it better *

03:20.401 --> 03:22.670
* When walls divide it

03:22.703 --> 03:28.309
* We tear them
down become united *

03:28.342 --> 03:32.045
* It's symptomatic
of automatic love *

03:32.079 --> 03:39.553
* This could be our night
for us to come alive *

03:39.587 --> 03:42.390
* It's time to show
them who we are *

03:42.423 --> 03:43.657
* Who we are

03:43.691 --> 03:49.963
*

03:49.997 --> 03:51.999
* Who we are

03:52.032 --> 03:57.938
*

03:57.971 --> 03:59.607
* Who we are

03:59.640 --> 04:02.576
* So fascinating

04:02.610 --> 04:05.513
* Our journey to
our destination *

04:05.546 --> 04:06.980
* Mmm

04:07.014 --> 04:10.117
* It's so amazing

04:10.150 --> 04:13.120
* On this golden
road we're blazin' *

04:13.153 --> 04:15.222
* Yeah

04:15.255 --> 04:18.992
* It's symptomatic
of automatic love *

04:19.026 --> 04:26.400
* This could be our night
for us to come alive *

04:26.434 --> 04:29.470
* It's time to show
them who we are *

04:29.503 --> 04:30.671
* Who we are

04:30.704 --> 04:32.105
*

04:32.139 --> 04:36.977
* Oh, Oh, Oh

04:37.010 --> 04:38.612
* Who we are

04:38.646 --> 04:44.385
* Boom, Boom, Boom

04:44.418 --> 04:46.687
* Who we are

04:46.720 --> 04:49.690
* It's so amazing

04:49.723 --> 04:53.994
* On this golden
road we're blazin' *

04:54.027 --> 04:57.197
* It's so amazing

04:57.230 --> 04:59.567
* On this golden
road we're blazin *

04:59.600 --> 05:04.672
* Who we are

05:04.705 --> 05:06.707
* Ah, baby!

05:06.740 --> 05:08.175
* Who we are

05:08.208 --> 05:14.415
* Boom, boom, boom

05:14.448 --> 05:15.683
* Who we are

05:15.716 --> 05:22.055
* Boom, boom, boom

05:22.089 --> 05:25.092
* Who we are

05:29.430 --> 05:32.065
(clapping)

05:32.099 --> 05:33.367
Um, Corki?

05:33.401 --> 05:34.702
What was that?

05:34.735 --> 05:35.669
It just came over me.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.472
A ten-foot jump with
a flawless landing,

05:38.506 --> 05:39.607
"just came over you"?

05:39.640 --> 05:40.641
(cellphone ringing)

05:40.674 --> 05:43.310
I took some dance
lessons when I was younger.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.750
Sorry guys,
I gotta take this.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.457
Another phone call she
doesn't want us to hear?

05:56.490 --> 05:58.225
She's gotta be a spy.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.493
For who,
the City Ballet?

05:59.527 --> 06:02.062
Hey, we take a break
while I fix this track?

06:02.095 --> 06:03.797
Caleb, our first
concert's Friday

06:03.831 --> 06:05.766
and we have musical
auditions coming up.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.536
Yeah, we don't have time
for you to be fixing things.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.838
This music
has to be perfect.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.806
What if a record
label shows up?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.842
You take all the
time you need, Caleb.

06:14.875 --> 06:15.909
I've been
working non-stop.

06:15.943 --> 06:19.146
This is the first time
I've left my room in days.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.781
That doesn't seem healthy.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.651
Eh, sunlight's overrated.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.719
Hey, has anyone else been
experiencing a brittleness

06:25.753 --> 06:27.488
of the legs lately?

06:27.521 --> 06:28.221
Come on.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.757
Let's take it
from the top.

06:32.793 --> 06:33.527
Eh.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.370
Hello, Kalen.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.574
It's Caleb.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.576
You're the music man?

06:48.609 --> 06:49.843
You've heard of me?

06:49.877 --> 06:51.078
Okay, calm down.

06:51.111 --> 06:54.214
Look, I need a really cool song
for our Spirit Squad to have

06:54.247 --> 06:55.816
at the opening night
football game.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.785
You like football right?

06:57.818 --> 07:00.353
Actually, I don't really
know much about it.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.122
Not really a sports guy.

07:02.155 --> 07:05.425
Could've fooled me,
you're so fit.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.698
Oh, well, I'm
slightly hyperactive,

07:10.731 --> 07:13.534
so I burn a lot of calories.

07:13.567 --> 07:17.871
Listen, I need this song
to be passionate, strong,

07:17.905 --> 07:20.674
and say:
Go Beagles!

07:20.941 --> 07:22.876
Think you could
do that for me?

07:22.910 --> 07:25.513
Heh, Hmph, heh.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.614
Good boy.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.753
Thanks, Kalan.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.560
Beagles eat bagels.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.728
Beagles soar like eagles.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.564
Gotta think more
ferocious... rabid.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.767
The rising tide
of Beagle pride!

07:46.800 --> 07:47.267
Yeah!

07:47.300 --> 07:48.536
Man: Quiet!

07:48.569 --> 07:50.638
You can't silence genius!

07:52.873 --> 07:55.308
And 5, and 6,
and 7, 8.

07:55.342 --> 07:59.713
1- 2- 3- 4-
5- 6- 7- 8

07:59.747 --> 08:03.951
1-2, and 3- 4-
5- 6- 7- 8

08:03.984 --> 08:09.757
1- 2- 3- 4- 5- 6,
boom, boom, ha,ha

08:09.790 --> 08:10.758
(squealing)

08:10.791 --> 08:11.759
That was so good!

08:11.792 --> 08:14.227
So good!

08:14.261 --> 08:15.729
MacKendrick Prep's
Spirit Squad

08:15.763 --> 08:17.865
has traditionally
been forgettable.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.600
Mediocre.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.467
An afterthought.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.736
I mean, way, way down
on my list of--

08:22.770 --> 08:23.804
Ok, ya.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.406
But, what
about right now?

08:26.439 --> 08:27.741
Right.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.777
I love this routine!

08:29.810 --> 08:32.780
Bold, and innovative,
like nothing I've ever seen.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.548
Thank you, Ms. Diona!

08:34.582 --> 08:36.516
Where did you get
the inspiration?

08:36.550 --> 08:37.785
Here.

08:37.818 --> 08:38.852
And here.

08:38.886 --> 08:39.519
And you.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.221
No, you didn't!

08:42.690 --> 08:45.759
Miss Mapa, this is a
private rehearsal.

08:45.793 --> 08:46.794
But those are my--

08:46.827 --> 08:48.461
Not now.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.363
Good job, Valerie.

08:50.397 --> 08:54.602
We will see you
at the game.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.970
And I'll see you, never,

08:57.004 --> 09:04.712
*

09:04.745 --> 09:06.413
You stole those
dance moves.

09:06.446 --> 09:07.247
From me.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.349
Ohhhh, I see
what's happening here.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.785
You like our moves
and want them for yourself,

09:11.819 --> 09:15.823
so you stage a public scene
where you call us the thieves.

09:15.856 --> 09:19.559
What do you think we are,
the dumb police?

09:19.593 --> 09:20.828
Heh.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.495
Hey, everybody.

09:22.529 --> 09:26.867
This freshman thinks
you're all super dumb.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.702
Jodi: I didn't say that.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.703
I didn't say that.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.570
No.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.539
You employed it.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.343
Implied, Heather.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.846
Well, we'll leave you to
deal with all these people

09:38.879 --> 09:42.783
you totally disrespected.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.990
So, you wanted to
see me about something?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.359
Um... I was wondering
if you keep files

09:52.392 --> 09:53.794
on the different
students here.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.829
Something that has
tons of information

09:55.863 --> 09:57.497
in one convenient location.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.399
Yes, but those are
confidential.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.703
In that case, I'm interested
in taking one of those

10:02.736 --> 10:04.004
honors-y courses.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.073
You know,
the harder ones?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.809
You have that
kind of potential.

10:08.842 --> 10:09.743
Oh yeah.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.746
I like to keep my
potential very hidden.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.382
What subject were
you interested in?

10:15.415 --> 10:18.385
Whatever subject is in
those text books there.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.319
These?

10:19.352 --> 10:19.720
No.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.821
Higher up.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.956
The ones that'll take
longer for you to get down.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.958
Are you talking
about Norse Mythology.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.626
My personal passion.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.595
Nobody ever
chooses Norse Mythology,

10:28.628 --> 10:30.798
but it's really
very fascinating.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.398
Yes!

10:31.431 --> 10:32.766
I know!

10:32.800 --> 10:34.601
My favorite
goddess is Freyja,

10:34.634 --> 10:36.804
who rides a chariot
pulled by two cats.

10:36.837 --> 10:37.637
No!

10:37.671 --> 10:38.538
Yes!

10:38.571 --> 10:40.974
She also has a boar
named Hildisvíni.

10:43.543 --> 10:44.544
Sun Hi?

10:45.813 --> 10:47.380
Strange girl.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.783
Hello, Thor.

10:50.684 --> 10:51.685
Kalen?

10:52.753 --> 10:53.887
Valerie.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.622
How's the song coming?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.791
Um... great.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.392
Can I get you something?

10:59.426 --> 11:00.360
Water?

11:00.393 --> 11:02.629
I thought I saw a cracker in
here somewhere.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.133
Look, I just wanted to remind
you how important this is.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.002
It has to be the greatest
football song ever written.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.771
That sounds like a
lot of pressure.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.773
I'm glad you
understand what's at stake.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.108
This can't be your
average, run of-the-mill anthem.

11:15.142 --> 11:19.947
It has to be bold,
fearless, and memorable.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.382
Yesterday you said it
had to be passionate,

11:22.415 --> 11:24.985
strong and about Beagles.

11:25.018 --> 11:29.156
Are you bold, fearless,
and memorable, Caleb?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.558
You said my name right.

11:31.591 --> 11:34.862
But I thought you--

11:34.895 --> 11:35.863
Ou hoo, uhh, hoo.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.165
(crash)

11:38.198 --> 11:48.408
*

11:48.441 --> 11:58.752
*

11:58.786 --> 11:59.853
Ow!

12:00.754 --> 12:01.989
A DNA sample?

12:02.022 --> 12:02.823
Really?

12:02.856 --> 12:04.858
DNA, no.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.160
Pain, yes.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.261
Why?

12:08.295 --> 12:10.764
I was hoping that would hurt
so bad that you'd just

12:10.798 --> 12:13.133
start yelling out stuff
about yourself.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.836
The entire school thinks I
stole the Spirit Squad's moves!

12:15.869 --> 12:17.704
Yeah, I heard that.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.840
Why'd you do it, Jodi?

12:19.873 --> 12:20.974
They stole our moves!

12:21.008 --> 12:23.510
They lifted our entire routine
and they're gonna do it

12:23.543 --> 12:25.512
at some football game in
front of everyone.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.647
We can't do the
same dance as them!

12:27.680 --> 12:29.749
We'll look like amateurs!

12:29.783 --> 12:31.751
Technically,
we are amateurs.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.719
Not the time, Corki!

12:32.752 --> 12:34.822
No one's gonna believe
a couple of freshmen

12:34.855 --> 12:37.657
over the Spirit Squad.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.059
They will if we have proof.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.795
Criminals always brag
about their crimes.

12:41.829 --> 12:44.464
We just need to record
Valerie confessing to someone.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.466
Sure, we'll just do
that with all our

12:46.499 --> 12:48.468
hi-tech
surveillance equipment.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.003
Good idea!

12:50.037 --> 12:56.776
*

12:56.810 --> 12:59.746
Here you go.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.182
Hi-tech
surveillance equipment.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.484
Both: Who are you?!

13:06.920 --> 13:08.655
(schoolbell ringing)

13:08.688 --> 13:15.863
*

13:15.896 --> 13:18.899
I said bold, fearless and
memorable, Caleb

13:18.932 --> 13:21.801
In other words:
better than this.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.136
Better?

13:23.170 --> 13:25.605
Nobody says that to
me about my music.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.140
Well, except my mom.

13:27.174 --> 13:31.744
But 29 hours of
labour gives you that right.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.950
*

13:36.984 --> 13:37.784
There they are!

13:39.953 --> 13:41.889
This is called a
Bionic Audio Booster.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.892
Allows you to hear conversations
up to 200 yards away.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.826
Jodi: This kinda draws
attention to itself.

13:46.860 --> 13:47.961
You're right.

13:47.995 --> 13:48.962
Let me hold it.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.763
It's recording,
go time.

13:50.797 --> 13:52.900
Group selfie, girls,
everybody duckface!

13:52.933 --> 13:53.800
Sun Hi!

13:53.833 --> 13:55.702
Jodi: You can't blog
a secret mission!

13:55.735 --> 13:57.204
Where's the fun in that?

13:57.237 --> 13:58.972
Sun Hi,
point it at Valerie!

13:59.006 --> 14:02.309
Heather, I have a secret to tell
you, and you can't tell anybody.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.845
Don't worry Val, I'm your
little piggy bank of secrets.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.047
Give me a deposit.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.583
Yesterday, I realized I'm
even prettier than I thought.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.851
(laughing)

14:14.888 --> 14:16.523
This is gonna take while.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.726
When they take a break,
they'll start talking.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.061
That's when we'll get 'em.

14:21.094 --> 14:21.828
Okay.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.999
(cellphone ringing)

14:26.033 --> 14:27.100
Sorry, it's my dad.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.635
I have to take this.

14:28.668 --> 14:29.769
Here's the charger.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.174
1- 2- 3- 4- 5- 6.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.775
She must have a
photographic memory.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.178
She's doing our
exact moves.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.712
How does she
sleep at night?

14:39.746 --> 14:42.149
Probably with
her eyes open.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.917
You know, like a snake.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.986
Factually-accurate, dig.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.054
Nice.

14:47.087 --> 14:50.757
How'd that go, good?

14:50.790 --> 14:52.625
What's she saying?

14:52.659 --> 14:53.826
Battery's dead.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.028
Oh, there's an outlet.

14:58.966 --> 15:03.270
So, the next move from here,
we're gonna step onto our left.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.604
(screaming)

15:07.774 --> 15:08.741
Valerie: Fire?

15:10.710 --> 15:11.979
(coughing)

15:14.314 --> 15:15.983
Valerie to the rescue!

15:24.024 --> 15:26.026
(laughing)

15:26.259 --> 15:28.996
This is a teachable
moment in safety girls!

15:29.029 --> 15:31.731
Selfie!

15:31.764 --> 15:33.866
Hashtag safety first!

15:38.271 --> 15:40.640
So, what did
I miss?

15:40.673 --> 15:41.108
(squealing)

15:45.945 --> 15:47.780
(cellphone ringing)

15:47.814 --> 15:49.082
Well, we've
gone viral.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.783
Whoever said there's
no such thing

15:50.817 --> 15:52.819
as bad publicity
was wrong.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.121
Valerie's gonna
get away with this.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.389
And we won't have a fresh
original dance number

15:56.423 --> 15:58.158
for our very
first concert.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.892
Or the audition for Oz.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.661
We can't let her win.

16:01.694 --> 16:02.962
Why do you care?

16:02.996 --> 16:03.530
What?

16:03.563 --> 16:04.431
We don't even know you!

16:04.464 --> 16:06.766
How can we be sure
you're on our side?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.268
Of course I'm
on your side.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.436
Why would you
say that?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.139
Kind of weird coincidence,
you get all of this hi-tech

16:12.172 --> 16:13.840
equipment you
know how to use,

16:13.873 --> 16:15.175
then it almost
blows us up!

16:15.208 --> 16:16.709
That was an accident!

16:18.311 --> 16:21.848
P.S. It did blow up.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.050
Sweet dreams, ladies!

16:23.816 --> 16:33.126
*

16:33.160 --> 16:35.728
Hey, look, it's the
merry band of thieves.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.698
Want us to slow down so
you can copy our walk?

16:38.731 --> 16:43.170
That's impossible, you have a
completely different body type.

16:43.203 --> 16:47.307
Ugh, you just
don't get it.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.178
You can't take something
from nothing.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.045
Oh hey, Valerie.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.247
I've been up all night
doing this beat.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.749
How could you
make beats for her?!

16:56.783 --> 16:57.784
Why not?

16:57.817 --> 16:59.886
Ugh, Valerie's
the enemy!

16:59.919 --> 17:03.056
She stole Jodi's moves
and now you're helping her.

17:05.758 --> 17:09.196
Why am I always the
last to know everything?

17:09.762 --> 17:10.863
It doesn't matter.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.732
Nobody can dance
to that anyway.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.102
Correction:
I can dance to this.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.803
I think you
should step off.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.471
Well, I think you
should dance off.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.739
With me.

17:19.772 --> 17:20.773
Now.

17:20.807 --> 17:21.608
Mhm.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.376
I'd rather do
something more fun.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.145
Like algebra.

17:25.178 --> 17:29.182
FYI, she hates
algebra.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.819
If you invented
those moves,

17:32.852 --> 17:34.821
we shouldn't stand a
chance against you, right?

17:34.854 --> 17:36.389
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.926
Or maybe you're the one
who's a thief and a liar.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.294
Ouuuu!

17:41.328 --> 17:42.295
Hit it, Caleb.

17:42.329 --> 17:49.068
*

17:49.102 --> 17:50.870
* I ain't serving up dinner

17:50.903 --> 17:53.840
* I'm serving up skills,
I was always a winner *

17:53.873 --> 17:56.376
* I'm serving up skills

17:56.409 --> 17:58.245
* You're just a beginner

17:58.278 --> 18:00.280
* Cause I'm serving up skills

18:00.313 --> 18:04.717
* I'm serving up skills,
I'm serving up la la la la la *

18:04.751 --> 18:06.519

* With, with, with, skills

18:25.572 --> 18:28.007
* Look at what I'm
working with, skills *

18:28.040 --> 18:33.746

18:33.780 --> 18:36.216
* This is what I'm working

18:36.249 --> 18:39.952

they so love to hate me *

18:39.986 --> 18:43.823

18:43.856 --> 18:47.660

* With, with, with, skills

19:12.919 --> 19:15.154
* Look at what
I'm working with, skills *

19:15.188 --> 19:20.360
*

19:20.393 --> 19:22.595
* This is what
I'm working with, skills *

19:22.629 --> 19:27.867
*

19:27.900 --> 19:30.169
* Look at what
I'm working with, skills *

19:30.203 --> 19:35.608
*

19:35.642 --> 19:38.545
* This is what
I'm working with, skills *

19:38.578 --> 19:43.450
(applausing)

19:47.954 --> 19:49.055
Whatever.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.491
I'm sure your Dance Moms
are very proud of you, kiddies.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.893
But you haven't
proven anything.

19:53.926 --> 19:54.894
What's that?

19:58.130 --> 20:00.166
What is this?

20:02.669 --> 20:04.571
Gimme that!

20:04.604 --> 20:07.574
This is a recording
of our rehearsal!

20:07.607 --> 20:11.411
I can't believe I was going
to give you my last cracker!

20:11.444 --> 20:12.412
Here it is.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.948
Proof that Valerie
stole her moves from Jodi!

20:17.016 --> 20:19.519
So I may have been slightly
influenced by your routine.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.020
Whatever, you can
have it back.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.522
Yeah, we don't
need your moves.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.592
We'll just go back to the ones
that have always worked for us.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.628
You mean the ones Ms. Diona
called mediocre and forgettable?

20:28.661 --> 20:31.664
Be gracious
in victory, Jodi.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.599
Nah.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.641
Thanks for
helping, Corki.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.443
I guess you're
really on our side.

20:43.476 --> 20:46.212
I can't believe I stood up
to Valerie like that --

20:46.245 --> 20:47.680
I feel so free!

20:47.714 --> 20:49.048
Calm down, Corki.

20:49.081 --> 20:49.549
Sorry.

20:53.085 --> 20:53.953
Don't worry.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.655
They may have
won the war,

20:55.688 --> 20:57.357
but they'll never
win the battle.

20:57.390 --> 21:01.628
Heather, that's
not the way you--

21:01.661 --> 21:02.562
Nevermind.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.038
Excuse me.

21:12.071 --> 21:12.605
Girls.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.478
Football game,
when is that?

21:18.511 --> 21:19.979
Friday night.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.315
Everyone around here goes
to football on Fridays.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.282
It's mandatory.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.485
But that's the night
of our world premiere.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.653
Not anymore.

21:26.686 --> 21:30.957
Looks like your music career
is over before it's begun.
