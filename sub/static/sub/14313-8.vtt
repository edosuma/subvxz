how can he not be impressed

14:22.728 --> 14:24.962
after I blew up
the MRD archives?

14:24.964 --> 14:27.648

You're going to be fine.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.413
We were able
to shut down your powers.

14:43.415 --> 14:46.133
So I think things will finally
be different for you.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.352
No, they won't.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.971
Has anyone ever tried
shutting down your powers?

14:50.973 --> 14:52.573
A long time ago.

14:52.575 --> 14:54.425
I'm guessing it didn't work.

14:54.427 --> 14:57.611
Look, I don't have
all the answers,

14:57.613 --> 14:59.897
but if there's
any chance at all,

14:59.899 --> 15:01.398
isn't it worth a shot?

Nitro,

we're just trying
to help you.

15:05.838 --> 15:09.540
Maybe you are, Rogue,
but the others,

15:09.542 --> 15:11.775
they don't care about
what happens to me.

15:11.777 --> 15:14.011
Why are you even with them?

We're losing altitude.

you had it in you.

We'll take care
of the Brotherhood.

No, please.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.028
Leave me here.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.564
He's right.
He's too unstable.

17:46.566 --> 17:51.068
Their amateur telepath
tried shutting off his power.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.088
I don't think it worked.
