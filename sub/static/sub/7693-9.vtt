FILLED WITH LEAPING GAZELLES,
WHILE YOU...

12:32.152 --> 12:35.185
HAVE A NICE CUP
OF SOOTHING TEA.

12:35.185 --> 12:37.257
( growling, roaring )

12:38.959 --> 12:40.390
TASTY!

12:45.365 --> 12:47.898
LEO, WHAT JUST
HAPPENED?

12:47.898 --> 12:51.541
I...MIGHT HAVE DISABLED
YOUR MOLECULAR KINESIS,

12:51.541 --> 12:53.373
BUT I ONLY DID IT
BECAUSE YOU CHEATED FIRST,

12:53.373 --> 12:55.876
SO THERE, WE'RE EVEN.
MORE TEA?

12:57.547 --> 13:01.781
LEO, YOU MADE ME NERVOUS
AND TRIGGERED MY COMMANDO APP.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.453
YOU TURNED ME INTO SPIKE!

13:03.453 --> 13:06.086
YEAH, WELL, NOW YOU'RE BACK
TO GOOD OL' NERDY CHASE.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.417
SO LET THIS BE A LESSON:

13:07.417 --> 13:11.862
NO ONE STEALS
 FROM THE MAGIC MAN.

13:11.862 --> 13:13.323
( beeping, whirring )

13:15.896 --> 13:20.170
( distorted )
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO ME,
FRUIT FLY?!

13:23.173 --> 13:24.174
( growling )

13:24.174 --> 13:26.176
(quavery) HEY...

13:26.176 --> 13:27.878
LOOK, EVERYBODY.

13:27.878 --> 13:29.109
SPIKE'S BACK.

13:34.014 --> 13:37.047
( gasps )
BUTTER PERRY ESCAPED!

13:37.047 --> 13:40.020
YOU CHECK THE BUS STATION,
I'LL CHECK THE PANCAKE HOUSE!

13:41.421 --> 13:44.154
(mock innocent)
OH, NO. WHAT HAPPENED?

13:46.026 --> 13:48.258
I DON'T GET IT.
BUTTER DOESN'T MELT
AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.

13:48.258 --> 13:50.961
AND WE CAN'T REBUILD IT
IN TIME FOR THE TALENT SHOW.

13:50.961 --> 13:53.263
HMM. TRAGIC.

13:54.965 --> 13:57.837
OH, WELL, LET'S GO
SEE A MOVIE. COME ON.

13:59.309 --> 14:01.311
Eddy:
SLOW YOUR ROLL, SHIRLEY!

14:01.311 --> 14:03.874
CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE!

14:03.874 --> 14:07.447
EDDY, CRANK UP THE HEAT--
FULL BLAST.

14:11.281 --> 14:13.583
BREE, HOW COULD YOU?

14:13.583 --> 14:16.856
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU WERE
SPENDING SO MUCH TIME WITH ADAM,

14:16.856 --> 14:17.928
I JUST GOT JEALOUS.

14:17.928 --> 14:21.161
SO YOU PURPOSELY
SABOTAGED ME?

14:21.161 --> 14:24.965
I'M GONNA GO SKETCH
MY DISAPPOINTMENT.

14:24.965 --> 14:28.999
WHEN HE'S DONE,
I'M HANGING IT UP
ON THE FRIDGE.

14:33.403 --> 14:35.946
( Chase growling,
roaring )

14:39.009 --> 14:43.914
GOODY. I LOVE IT
WHEN ALL THE EASY TARGETS
ARE GATHERED IN ONE PLACE.

14:43.914 --> 14:46.186
THERE YOU ARE.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.159
I HOPE THIS SIGNAL INTERRUPTER
WORKS ON SPIKE, TOO.

14:49.159 --> 14:51.091
( beeping, whirring )

14:53.393 --> 14:54.995
( roaring )

15:01.301 --> 15:04.904
TWIRL THAT, PRINCESS!

15:07.107 --> 15:09.079
COME ON,
YOU PIECE OF JUNK!

15:09.079 --> 15:10.941
( roaring )

15:17.988 --> 15:19.049
AAAH!!!

15:28.198 --> 15:31.531
IT'S LIKE THIS THING
IS AMPLIFYING SPIKE'S
BIONIC AGGRESSION

15:31.531 --> 15:33.964
INSTEAD OF INTERRUPTING--
 OH.

15:33.964 --> 15:36.106
( roaring )

15:49.179 --> 15:51.321
SAVE A CUP,
SAVE THE PLANET!

15:57.687 --> 15:59.990
OWEN'S NOT
RETURNING MY CALLS.

15:59.990 --> 16:02.092
HOW AM I GONNA
MAKE THIS UP TO HIM?

16:02.092 --> 16:04.634
LOOK, THE DAMAGE IS DONE.
BREE.

16:04.634 --> 16:07.998
UNLESS YOU HAVE 28 POUNDS
OF DELICIOUS POPCORN TO
SOAK UP HIS BUTTER ART.

16:07.998 --> 16:11.141
YES!
 YOU DO?

16:11.141 --> 16:16.546
NO. I MEAN,
WHAT IF WE BUILD OWEN
A NEW PROTEST STATUE?

16:16.546 --> 16:18.008
HOW?

16:18.008 --> 16:19.079
( whooshing )

16:22.652 --> 16:24.714
WITH 28 POUNDS OF POPCORN.

16:24.714 --> 16:26.656
SWEET!

16:26.656 --> 16:30.190
BUT HOW ARE WE EVER
GONNA POP IT ALL BEFORE
THE TALENT SHOW ENDS?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.461
OH, I GOT THIS.

16:34.224 --> 16:36.996
( popcorn popping )

16:38.028 --> 16:39.669
THAT'LL WORK.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.077
HEY, BREE.
THIS BETTER BE IMPORTANT.

16:47.077 --> 16:50.110
I WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF DOODLING MY PAIN AWAY.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.083
OWEN, I KNOW
YOU'RE MAD AT ME,

16:53.083 --> 16:57.117
BUT HOPEFULLY THIS
GIGANTIC WASTE OF POPCORN
MAKES IT UP TO YOU.

17:01.791 --> 17:04.694
ADAM! STOP LICKING
PRINCIPAL PERRY!

17:04.694 --> 17:07.727
I CAN'T HELP IT!
SHE'S SALTY.

17:07.727 --> 17:11.361
I'M REALLY SORRY THAT
I MELTED YOUR BUTTER SCULPTURE.

17:11.361 --> 17:12.801
HER EYES!

17:12.801 --> 17:15.734
THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL!

17:15.734 --> 17:19.038
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE STARING
DEEP INTO MY SOUL.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.310
THEY'RE COOKIES.

17:22.512 --> 17:24.513
I WAS SO UPSET.

17:24.513 --> 17:28.377
BUT...THIS GESTURE
IS MAKING MY HEART
MELT LIKE...

17:28.377 --> 17:31.451
BUTTER?
 NO!
 NO!

17:31.451 --> 17:33.383
( roaring )

17:33.383 --> 17:35.355
( crashing )

17:35.355 --> 17:37.787
THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A SLAM PUNK!

17:37.787 --> 17:38.728
( crashing continues )

17:40.590 --> 17:41.831
NICE SPIKE.

17:41.831 --> 17:43.333
GOOD SPIKE. SIT!

17:43.333 --> 17:44.494
SPIKE, SIT!

17:45.765 --> 17:47.297
( roars )

17:49.169 --> 17:52.172
OH, HEY. DID I MENTION
SPIKE'S BACK?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.246
OH!

17:56.246 --> 17:59.209
I SMELL BUTTER!

18:00.380 --> 18:02.612
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS?

18:02.612 --> 18:03.753
I AM!

18:03.753 --> 18:05.555
I LOVE IT!

18:05.555 --> 18:07.757
THE TALENT SHOW IS OVER!

18:07.757 --> 18:09.088
WE HAVE A WINNER!

18:09.088 --> 18:10.820
NO!!!

18:10.820 --> 18:12.862
( roaring )

18:16.466 --> 18:17.867
Perry: NO!!!

18:19.369 --> 18:22.202
HOW DARE YOU
DESTROY

18:22.202 --> 18:26.436
THE MONA LISA THAT
WAS MY POPCORN BUST?!

18:28.738 --> 18:30.109
( spits )

18:30.109 --> 18:33.543
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT,
SHOULDER PADS?

18:35.745 --> 18:37.517
EASY, BUTCH.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.690
YOUR MOUTH IS WRITIN' A CHECK
THAT YOU CAN'T CASH.

18:40.690 --> 18:43.323
OH, YEAH?
WELL, SANTA CALLED--

18:43.323 --> 18:46.296
HE WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'LL
BE MAKING TOYS THIS YEAR!

18:46.296 --> 18:49.259
(baby talk)
WHY BOTHER MAKIN' A DOLLY

18:49.259 --> 18:52.162
WHEN I HAVE
MY OWN RIGHT HERE?

18:52.162 --> 18:55.365
OOH! THAT'S A FUNNY JOKE.

18:55.365 --> 18:58.808
WHERE'D YOU GET IT FROM,
YOUR CAT'S LITTER BOX?

18:58.808 --> 19:04.714
OHH-HO-HO. NOBODY
 TALKS ABOUT MY CATS!
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN!

19:04.714 --> 19:07.777
BACK WHEN I WAS IN
THE TIJUANA LADIES
WRESTLING LEAGUE,

19:07.777 --> 19:09.819
THEY CALLED ME
 LA ROSA BONITA!

19:09.819 --> 19:11.351

19:11.351 --> 19:12.722
AND WATCH OUT,

19:12.722 --> 19:14.884

LA ROSA BONITA!

20:41.911 --> 20:44.444
AAAH!

20:44.444 --> 20:48.878
WHY AM I BEING SMOTHERED
BY A FEMALE MEXICAN WRESTLER
IN A PANTSUIT?!

20:50.420 --> 20:51.921
I'LL FILL YA IN LATER.

21:01.531 --> 21:04.294

21:04.294 --> 21:05.795
( all laugh )

21:05.795 --> 21:08.037

WELL, CHASE, YOU FINALLY
GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

21:11.301 --> 21:13.773
YOU ARE NO LONGER
INVISIBLE AT THIS SCHOOL.

21:13.773 --> 21:17.677
YOU'LL FOREVER BE KNOWN
AS THE KID WHO GOT PINNED

21:17.677 --> 21:19.949
THANK YOU, LEO.

21:19.949 --> 21:23.753
PINNED LIKE THE BUTTERFLY
ON THE SCIENCE TEACHER'S WALL.

21:23.753 --> 21:26.656
GOTCHA, LEO.

21:26.656 --> 21:30.660
YA KNOW,
IF BEING PINNED WAS A TALENT,
YOU WOULD HAVE WON.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.892
