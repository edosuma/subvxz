WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:04.505
LAVON:
 We are
 at your engagement party.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.606
LEMON:
 You know how difficult

00:05.606 --> 00:06.440
this is for me.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.975
Difficult never stopped me.

00:07.975 --> 00:09.610
LEMON:
 This needs to stop;
 I can't handle it.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.412
I'm trying to move on,
a-and you won't let me.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.147
ZOE:
 Judson-- he broke up with me.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.783
Yeah, I heard. There
was a town pool-- when
y'all would break up--

00:15.783 --> 00:18.619
and I had, I had 100 bucks
on tonight. (laughs)

00:18.619 --> 00:20.121
I was trying to
get over someone,

00:20.121 --> 00:22.022
and I shouldn't have
dated, but I wanted to

00:22.022 --> 00:23.757
because I liked you.
DIDI: No one knows
 what's gonna happen

00:23.757 --> 00:25.193
between two people.

00:25.193 --> 00:29.363
Until yesterday
 I was having such a good time.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.204
Good morning,
Zoe Hart.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.542
You, uh, want
some coffee?

00:44.044 --> 00:47.748
I get it, you're probably trying
to cut back on the caffeine.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.950
You seemed a little wired
recently, Doc.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.952
What's that?

00:51.952 --> 00:55.523
Oh, corn flakes.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.058
Yeah, oh, they
do look good.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.227
I'll have some, too.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.595
I love me some corn flakes.

01:01.595 --> 01:02.763
You do?

01:02.763 --> 01:03.764
You love corn flakes?

01:03.764 --> 01:04.864
I do, yeah.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.867
Great.

01:06.867 --> 01:10.070
* *

01:12.506 --> 01:13.441
Oops.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.676
Oh, here, enjoy
your breakfast.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.679
So I take it you're
still mad at me

01:18.679 --> 01:22.583
for the whole breaking
you and Judson up thing?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.388
(giggles)

01:27.388 --> 01:30.224
So Agnes is baking us a bunch
of sample wedding cakes.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.059
She's going to bake us
caramel chocolate cake,

01:32.059 --> 01:33.361
a chocolate
sour cream cake.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.163
Wait a minute, I thought
you wanted lemon cake.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.565
Honey, I know how much
you like your chocolate.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.704
You would give up
your signature fruit for me?

01:43.704 --> 01:46.073
George Tucker, I'd give
up anything for you.

01:46.073 --> 01:47.908
(chuckles)

01:47.908 --> 01:49.076
Thank you.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.611
Give me that-- no, I'm okay.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.313
So, what are
you doing today?

01:52.313 --> 01:55.516
Ooh, I am driving to
Mobile to pick out fabrics

01:55.516 --> 01:57.418
for the bridesmaids' dresses,
I'm meeting with the caterer,

01:57.418 --> 01:59.287
I'm going to reconfirm our
block of rooms at the inn,

01:59.287 --> 02:00.621
and I'm gonna find
Pete Terwilliger

02:00.621 --> 02:02.022
and get him to fix that
wedding invitation typo.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.357
Okay, okay,
you know what?

02:03.357 --> 02:05.226
That-That's, that's
way too much stuff.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.594
Why don't,
why don't you go ahead

02:06.594 --> 02:09.597
and save that for Saturday,
and I can go with you?

02:09.597 --> 02:13.100
And, I don't know,
you can take today off.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.935
(laughs)
I cannot take the day off.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.937
Lemon, now that I know what
you've been dealing with--

02:16.937 --> 02:19.607
finding your mother
with another family and...

02:19.607 --> 02:21.642
I get why you've
been stressed out,

02:21.642 --> 02:25.946
but, baby, let's face it, you
need to blow off some steam,

02:25.946 --> 02:28.115
so...

02:28.115 --> 02:30.884
I... guess I can
use a break.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.453
So why don't you go ahead
and give me that to-do list

02:32.453 --> 02:33.687
that I know you got
in your purse?

02:33.687 --> 02:34.855
(clears throat)

02:34.855 --> 02:36.857
Your list,
the one in your purse.
I don't...

02:36.857 --> 02:38.492
I know there's one
in there.
That's weird, it's not there.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.860
You got a list in there--
I know you do.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.363
All right...
great, great.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.365
Okay, as of right now...

02:44.365 --> 02:46.634
the only thing
on this list...

02:47.468 --> 02:51.305
...is to relax
and have fun.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.244
Yes, relax, have
fun-- I can do that.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.878
All right, I love you, babe.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.079
Love you.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.982
She's gonna blow.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.184
Any minute.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.588
It worked this morning.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.590
Huh, mm.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.625
Ain't that
always the way?

03:11.625 --> 03:13.494
Something seems to be
working perfectly,

03:13.494 --> 03:16.797
then all of a sudden,
it's not.

03:16.797 --> 03:20.268
One minute, you and the
volcano are rock solid.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.936
The next minute, the volcano
won't even return your calls.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.405
Okay, Lavon,

03:24.405 --> 03:26.940
so far today I have heard you
compare Didi to a volcano,

03:26.940 --> 03:29.643
a bowl of grits, and Dash's
pet cockatoo Pickles.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.679
No, no, no,
I said Didi

03:31.679 --> 03:33.213
wasn't like Pickles
because Pickles knows

03:33.213 --> 03:35.048
how to use a damn phone.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.384
I just don't get it.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.286
Things were finally going well
with me and Didi.

03:38.286 --> 03:42.089
Then she runs out,
won't return my calls.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.991
Well, at least you didn't take
your girl out line dancing,

03:43.991 --> 03:46.294
only to have her escape
out the bathroom window.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.462
And I'm a good dancer.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.898
Joelle climbed
out the bathroom window?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.333
When did that happen?

03:52.333 --> 03:53.467
Last night at
Tricky Rick's.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.304
Women-- why are they
so confusing?

03:56.304 --> 03:57.605
What we need...

03:57.605 --> 03:58.406
Hmm.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.640
...is some insight.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.641
Zoe.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.009
What, are you kidding me?

04:02.009 --> 04:03.844
She's the most confounding one
of 'em all.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.479
Still isn't talking to me just
'cause I put a little wager

04:05.479 --> 04:08.449
on her breaking up with, uh--
what's his name?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.050
Judson.
Yeah.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.151
(Zoe clears throat)

04:11.151 --> 04:12.520
Hello, Lavon.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.923
Lavon, I'll see you later.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.692
Bye.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.494
Listen, Zoe,
I, I need a favor.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.728
Anything.
Well,

04:21.728 --> 04:25.466
as you may know, uh,
Didi and I had a...

04:25.466 --> 04:26.734
romantic encounter

04:26.734 --> 04:28.502
after the
Sweetie Pie dance.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.737
Then, all of a sudden,
she said

04:29.737 --> 04:32.172
she wasn't feeling well
and she left.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.441
Now she won't answer
the phone.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.108
Well, did you do something
to make her angry?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.610
Can you find out for me?

04:36.610 --> 04:40.814
Well, you know, relationships
aren't really my forte.

04:40.814 --> 04:41.949
Just ask Judson.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.484
Please.

04:43.484 --> 04:47.287
For you, my best friend
in BlueBell, I will try.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.356
Ah, thank you.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.857
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.759
I will take you to the Rammer
Jammer tonight to thank you.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.761
You take me to the Rammer
Jammer almost every night.

04:53.761 --> 04:57.230
Yes, but tonight
I will let you pay.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.231
Ooh.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.232
MAN:
 Come experience

04:59.232 --> 05:02.102
the wonders of science.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.103
Mr. Sunberg.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.005
George.
Hey.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.507
Who are you today?

05:06.507 --> 05:07.675
Y-You-You're
Copernicus.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.042
(grunts)
You're Galileo.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.211
Hey, stick around,
you might relearn something.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.646
(George chuckles)

05:12.646 --> 05:13.881
Gather round, everyone,

05:13.881 --> 05:16.384
gather round,
for I have a rather

05:16.384 --> 05:19.487
weighty subject
that I'd like to discuss.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.955
I am speaking, of
course, about...

05:21.955 --> 05:23.657
gravity.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.694
Mr. Sunberg,
Dash Dewitt for the Blawker,

05:26.694 --> 05:28.796
BlueBell's number one
online gossip site.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.364
We did The Odd Couple
together, Dash,

05:30.364 --> 05:31.399
I know who you are.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.866
Right.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.935
Well, I just have a few
questions about this experiment

05:34.935 --> 05:36.269
that you and your
wife are conducting

05:36.269 --> 05:37.438
later on tonight
in the town square.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.906
I understand

05:38.906 --> 05:42.342
that you're attempting
to communicate with aliens.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.178
Uh, that's really none
of your business, Dash

05:45.178 --> 05:47.180
The experiment we're
conducting is personal.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.315
It doesn't
concern you.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.950
Oh, really?

05:49.950 --> 05:54.555
A teacher who believes he talks
to aliens doesn't concern me?

05:54.555 --> 05:55.689
MR. SUNBERG:
Well, uh,

05:55.689 --> 05:57.224
my beliefs are not relevant.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.693
If you're telling the aliens
to touch down in BlueBell,

05:59.693 --> 06:01.562
I think the people have
a right to know.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.464
Look, Dash,
I am not talking to the aliens.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.665
They are talking to me!

06:04.665 --> 06:07.768
(crowd gasping and murmuring)

06:07.768 --> 06:10.471
Say what?

06:16.410 --> 06:17.445
(bell dings)

06:17.445 --> 06:18.512
I just can't
believe it.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.813
I mean, the man
seriously thinks

06:19.813 --> 06:22.416
that aliens are really trying
to talk to him.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.351
Yeah, well, I can't say
it surprises me.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.753
Man's been two bricks
short of a load

06:25.753 --> 06:28.321
ever since he married
that crazy-pants wife of his.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.557
Yeah.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.158
Women sure do have a way
of ruining things,

06:31.158 --> 06:32.826
don't they?

06:32.826 --> 06:34.462
I guess that depends
on the woman.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.163
Speaking of which...

06:37.465 --> 06:42.335
Oh, hey, Joelle, you are
looking lovely today.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.972
I'll, uh, talk to
you later, Wade.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.008
What are you doing
here, Joelle,

06:48.008 --> 06:49.710
looking for another window
to climb out?

06:49.710 --> 06:52.580
I know you're mad, okay,
but I had a real good reason

06:52.580 --> 06:54.114
for jumping out that
window last night.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.616
Oh, do tell.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.450
I'm on the run.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.118
From who?

06:58.118 --> 06:59.252
My ex-boyfriend Ed.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.988
See, things
didn't exactly

07:00.988 --> 07:04.792
end well between us, and I
sort of set his lawn on fire.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.627
You, you sort of set
his lawn on fire?

07:06.627 --> 07:07.928
I didn't mean to,

07:07.928 --> 07:09.497
but, you know, with the
dry season and all...

07:09.497 --> 07:11.031
Anyway,

07:11.031 --> 07:15.268
Ed got his pal the sheriff to
issue a warrant for my arrest,

07:15.268 --> 07:16.637
so I hightailed
it to Georgia,

07:16.637 --> 07:17.905
which is where I'm
supposed to be right now.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.307
So why do you have
to leave?

07:20.307 --> 07:22.510
'Cause last night Ed
came into Tricky Rick's,

07:22.510 --> 07:24.011
and I think he saw me,

07:24.011 --> 07:25.779
so now that he's
on my trail again,

07:25.779 --> 07:29.382
he's not gonna stop till he
finds me and puts me in jail.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.818
I'm sorry, Wade.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.786
I really thought we could
have been something.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.922
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
now hold on a minute, hold on.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.757
If he only caught
a glimpse of you,

07:36.757 --> 07:38.158
he can't be sure
what he saw,

07:38.158 --> 07:40.794
so all we got to do is
find the guy and, uh,

07:40.794 --> 07:42.530
convince him
it wasn't you.
Sweetie,

07:42.530 --> 07:43.997
you don't want to get
mixed up in this.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.398
Ed finds out you're
involved with me

07:45.398 --> 07:46.800
and he will be
all over you.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.736
Trust me, okay,
look, just, uh,

07:48.736 --> 07:50.638
just go back
over to my place,

07:50.638 --> 07:53.741
hide out,
and I'll figure this out.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.410
Okay.
Okay.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.411
Thanks, Wade.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.412
All right.

07:59.412 --> 08:01.481
Mmm.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.989
Lemon is set
on having dinner served,

08:08.989 --> 08:10.924
but then people got
to wait for their food

08:10.924 --> 08:13.026
and there's not enough time
for dancing.

08:13.026 --> 08:13.827
Know what I mean?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.663
It's true, dancing is fun.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.164
Yeah, but then, you know,
if we have a buffet,

08:17.164 --> 08:19.432
then people-- they got,
they got to wait in line,

08:19.432 --> 08:20.433
so...

08:20.433 --> 08:21.702
People hate lines.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.170
Yeah, they...

08:24.404 --> 08:26.674
Oh, hey, Zoe, what
are you doing here?

08:26.674 --> 08:27.941
Uh, well,
since Addy and Brick

08:27.941 --> 08:29.943
are doing
a mobile vaccine clinic,

08:29.943 --> 08:32.111
Tom Long is filling in
at the reception desk.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.113
(laughs)

08:33.113 --> 08:35.015
This has to be the
highlight of his year.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.984
That's exactly what he wrote
in his e-mail to me.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.519
Well, you are more than
welcome to hide out here

08:39.519 --> 08:41.688
as long as you need to.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.924
Thanks, pal,
I appreciate the safe haven.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.127
George, George,
school board just fired me.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.729
MRS. SUNBERG:
All the man did
was tell the truth.

08:48.729 --> 08:52.132
He is a vehicle for
extraterrestrial contact.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.901
MR. SUNBERG:
Don't worry, Dotty,
George is gonna fix this.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.102
Aren't you,
George?

08:55.102 --> 08:56.269
Uh, y-yeah.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.739
Yeah, I'm going to,
I'm going to do my...

08:58.739 --> 09:00.574
You know what? This
is probably a talk

09:00.574 --> 09:02.776
we should have
in my office.

09:09.182 --> 09:13.854
It's always interesting
around here.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.222
You know
what's interesting?

09:17.190 --> 09:21.128
This Kardashian sister.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.162
Yep.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.131
She finally connects
with someone,

09:24.131 --> 09:27.768
thinks things are going great
when suddenly...

09:27.768 --> 09:29.737
he doesn't call her.

09:29.737 --> 09:30.938
Poor Kardashian.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.473
Actually, Khloe is
very happily married,

09:33.473 --> 09:35.909
but I see
your point.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.511
Okay, I have to
tell someone.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.881
Yes, I'm
ignoring Lavon,

09:40.881 --> 09:42.582
but you would, too, if
you knew what I know.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.785
Please don't tell me it's
some weird, kinky sex thing.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.187
It's worse.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.758
I found this hidden
under his desk.

09:50.758 --> 09:54.027
(whispering):
Under his desk?
Hidden.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.328
He told me recently
that he's hung up

09:55.328 --> 09:57.831
on someone, and I think
that someone is Lemon.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.667
Shh.
What should I do?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.168
Should I
tell George?

10:01.168 --> 10:03.804
That poor, sweet man is
planning their wedding.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.974
Wait, don't tell
anyone anything, okay?

10:06.974 --> 10:10.077
I'm sure that there's a
logical explanation for this.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.714
I'm gonna find out
what it is.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.829
SELECTMAN:
 Look, I'd be perfectly willing

10:28.829 --> 10:30.931
to write
the grant proposal myself,

10:30.931 --> 10:33.400
but time is running out.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.769
Okay, okay, so we'll call
an emergency session

10:35.769 --> 10:37.905
of the town council
and have it approved.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.673
I'm sure we can
get that...
Lavon!

10:39.673 --> 10:40.674
Oh.

10:40.674 --> 10:43.711
Hi, um, can I have a quick word?

10:43.711 --> 10:44.745
Zoe, I'm in a meeting.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.146
It's important.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.715
It's about that fruit problem
we're having.

10:47.715 --> 10:51.752
Our oranges,
especially our Lemons.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.257
Uh, I'll be
right back.

10:57.257 --> 11:00.393
What do you mean
talking about lemons?

11:00.393 --> 11:01.729
Didi has been

11:01.729 --> 11:03.997
avoiding me because
she found this...

11:03.997 --> 11:06.433
hidden under your desk.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.969
Oh, my God.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.138
I forgot that
was under there.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.605
What was it doing there, Lavon?

11:12.605 --> 11:14.241
Please tell me
it doesn't mean

11:14.241 --> 11:16.576
what I think it might.

11:16.576 --> 11:19.012
Look, Zoe, just
forget you saw this...

11:19.012 --> 11:22.282
Forget? You have a picture
of Lemon hidden in your office,

11:22.282 --> 11:24.484
which indicates more than
a mayoral relationship.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.486
And I don't hear any denials.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.621
I-It's over.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.958
(whispering):
"It's over"?

11:30.958 --> 11:32.159
Wait, you mean, like,

11:32.159 --> 11:34.227
it was not over?
It was a thing?

11:34.227 --> 11:35.395
You and Lemon?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.664
Oh, my God.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.132
Does George know?

11:39.132 --> 11:42.169
(people chattering nearby)
No. And he can't know.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.772
No one can ever know.
But Didi already does.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.808
Mayor... Mayor Hayes,
we've got a deadline.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.376
Right. I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm coming.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.011
All right.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.680
Okay, l-look, Zoe, I'm...

11:53.680 --> 11:56.049
I am gonna tell you everything,
I want to tell you everything,

11:56.049 --> 11:58.451
but right now you have got
to cover with Didi. Please.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.954
I can't just lie to her.
This gets out,
it will hurt

12:00.954 --> 12:02.355
a whole lot of good
people, myself included.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.157
I'm sorry for putting
you in this position,

12:04.157 --> 12:05.458
but you have got
to keep this secret.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.928
You don't know what
you're asking me.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.130
Zoe, as your friend,
I'm begging you. Please.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.632
(sighs)

12:12.632 --> 12:14.134
Okay.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.004
Thank you.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.740
LAVON: Okay, uh...
(voice trails off)

12:21.641 --> 12:23.443
ERIC:
 Look, George, I know

12:23.443 --> 12:26.046
this may sound crazy, and
I don't blame you for being

12:26.046 --> 12:28.615
a nonbeliever-- I was a
nonbeliever before I met Dotty.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.952
But a year ago, I convinced him
to come to Roswell with me

12:31.952 --> 12:33.353
and participate
in this experiment...

12:33.353 --> 12:35.555
And the very next night
I had a dream

12:35.555 --> 12:37.090
that I was taken up into space.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.591
He thought
he had a dream.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.893
And then about
a month later,

12:39.893 --> 12:41.094
I started having
these episodes

12:41.094 --> 12:43.063
where I would lose
control of my tongue,

12:43.063 --> 12:44.965
like somebody was trying
to talk through me,

12:44.965 --> 12:46.466
and my arms
would go numb.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.701
It's like they're trying
to talk to us in code.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.570
Okay.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.671
Have you...

12:51.671 --> 12:53.473
considered
a medical explanation?

12:53.473 --> 12:57.244
Of course. I've been
to Mobile, and I went
to doctor after doctor,

12:57.244 --> 12:59.246
but no one could find
the explanation

12:59.246 --> 13:01.348
as to what was
happening with me.
Eric can't

13:01.348 --> 13:04.351
really be fired
for his beliefs, can he?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.887
(sighs)
If he kept them to himself,

13:06.887 --> 13:08.822
no, he couldn't be.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.257
But unfortunately,

13:10.257 --> 13:12.292
he talked about them
at an official school function.

13:12.292 --> 13:16.329
George, you know
what teaching means to me.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.598
There has to be

13:18.598 --> 13:20.467
something you can do.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.878
(phone rings)

13:30.878 --> 13:33.146
Hey, sweetheart.
Almost finished?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.547
I'm sorry to have
to do this to you, baby,

13:34.547 --> 13:36.316
but I'm gonna have
to cancel dinner tonight.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.151
I've got to mount an entire
defense to the school board

13:38.151 --> 13:39.586
for Eric Sunberg
by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.455
Oh, it's okay.
Don't you worry about me.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.756
Okay.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.893
How's the day of fun going?

13:45.893 --> 13:49.329
So good.
I'm having the best time.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.463
Ah.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.764
Right.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.967
What are you doing right now?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.803
Picking bridesmaids' fabrics.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.171
Lemon!

13:58.171 --> 14:01.008
Oh, Lemon,
I am disappointed, okay?

14:01.008 --> 14:03.343
You were supposed
to be relaxing.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.345
(groans)
Fine, George, fine.

14:05.345 --> 14:09.682
Next time you see me,
I will be so relaxed,

14:09.682 --> 14:13.353
you'll just think that
I've joined a reggae band.

14:15.622 --> 14:19.626
So, did you talk to Lavon?

14:19.626 --> 14:21.661
I didn't need to.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.496
Look, Didi,

14:23.496 --> 14:27.334
the truth is...
the picture's mine.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.936
I-I took it
from Lemon's house

14:28.936 --> 14:30.938
when I was trying
to be a Belle.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.339
Yours?

14:32.339 --> 14:35.208
Well, why didn't you say
so in the first place?

14:35.208 --> 14:38.578
Because...
I was embarrassed.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.348
Thank you. I've been wanting
to fit in to BlueBell,

14:41.348 --> 14:44.384
and I figured Lemon,
queen of this town, was key.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.754
And if I studied her--
the way she did her hair

14:47.754 --> 14:50.490
and how she dressed-- then
maybe I could fit in, too.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.825
You haven't done anything
at all to be like her.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.962
I tried.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.829
In my house,

14:56.829 --> 14:58.231
by myself.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.233
Then I realized
it was futile,

15:00.233 --> 15:02.235
you know, because Lemon...

15:02.235 --> 15:04.104
well, she's perfect,

15:04.104 --> 15:05.872
and I could never achieve

15:05.872 --> 15:07.607
that level of wonderfulness.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.978
(nervous laugh)
'Cause, you know,

15:10.978 --> 15:12.912
she's so pretty
with that blonde hair.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.950
But why'd you hide the
picture under Lavon's desk?

15:16.950 --> 15:18.651
Well...

15:18.651 --> 15:22.089
I was looking at it,
like I do, in Lavon's study

15:22.089 --> 15:24.424
when I thought I
heard someone coming.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.026
So I hid it.

15:26.026 --> 15:29.296
Because, you know, I don't
want anyone to know--
especially Lemon.

15:29.296 --> 15:32.465
Because of what I said--
you know, she's so perfect,

15:32.465 --> 15:34.034
so pretty.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.470
I think I get it.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.538
This happened

15:38.538 --> 15:41.841
with my cousin Donna
and her gym teacher.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.411
And I am so glad

15:44.411 --> 15:46.646
you feel you could
confide in me.

15:47.647 --> 15:48.982
Thank you.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.683
I'm just so relieved!
Now things can

15:50.683 --> 15:52.552
finally get back to normal--
'cause I didn't know

15:52.552 --> 15:54.421
how I was gonna keep
working at that office

15:54.421 --> 15:57.124
knowing this terrible secret
about George's fiancée.

15:57.124 --> 16:00.427
Yeah, that would've been hard.
He's the sweetest
man I've ever known.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.928
Besides Lavon.
And I don't think

16:01.928 --> 16:04.831
I could've lived with myself
had I kept it from him.

16:04.831 --> 16:08.735
You know?
Well, lucky for you,
you don't have to.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.038
Hey, you two.
Hey,

16:11.038 --> 16:12.605
George!
You still
hiding out

16:12.605 --> 16:13.606
from, uh, Tom?

16:13.606 --> 16:15.042
Yeah.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.409
I should get back, though.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.511
It was good to see you.
Good-bye.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.382
Okay. See ya.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.653
* *

16:28.888 --> 16:30.557
Oh, yeah.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.392
(giggles)

16:32.392 --> 16:35.695
* *

16:35.695 --> 16:39.666
YOGA TEACHER (on video):
In Warrior pose.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.802
* *

16:42.802 --> 16:44.104
No.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.473
No, the seafood option
should be local.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.675
YOGA TEACHER (on video):
Cartwheel down...

16:48.675 --> 16:51.078
into Plank pose.

16:51.078 --> 16:54.514
* *

16:54.514 --> 16:56.249
Ugh!

16:56.249 --> 16:58.685
Lemon, what is wrong with you?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.287
(grunts)

17:04.491 --> 17:08.361
It is just so great
to finally see you in action.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.363
Doing your doctor thing.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.232
Just restocking
the shelves.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.102
Uh, yeah, well, you're
doing it super awesomely.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.769
(chuckles)
You think

17:16.769 --> 17:20.207
I'm doing a good job?
Well, yeah,
sure, I guess.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.976
You're answering the
phones, and you got me
that coffee that I wanted.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.778
Oh... oh, I forgot.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.848
Uh, you missed a phone call
from George Tucker

17:28.848 --> 17:30.250
a while ago.
What?

17:30.250 --> 17:31.951
What did you tell him?

17:31.951 --> 17:34.854
That... you...
weren't here.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.022
Oh, good.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.290
That is good.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.291
Whew!
Always tell George

17:38.291 --> 17:40.760
that I'm not here, okay?

17:40.760 --> 17:43.062
Zoe Hart left the building.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.666
Hey, Zoe? Um,

17:46.666 --> 17:48.801
this is... this is
Eric and Dotty Sunberg,

17:48.801 --> 17:52.639
and... we have a little bit
of a situation here.

17:55.942 --> 17:59.412
The board refused to drop
the charges, but I figure

17:59.412 --> 18:01.548
if I can prove that there's
a medical explanation for it,

18:01.548 --> 18:03.650
I might be able
to get him his job back.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.519
I'll get a history on him
and I'll run some tests.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.321
Call you later.
Or better yet, e-mail.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.990
I-I know Mr. Sunberg can
be a little bit kooky,

18:10.990 --> 18:14.261
but he made a major
impact on my life.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.063
So I... just want to
thank you for doing this.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.698
I knew I could
count on you.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.500
You're a... you're
a really great friend.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.371
You, too. I'm
sure that you have
a ton of work to do,

18:24.371 --> 18:27.407
so I'll see you around.
Oh, don't worry about me--
I'm gonna be here

18:27.407 --> 18:29.242
until we find out
what's wrong with him.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.480
Okay.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.819
The initial test
results are in,

18:39.819 --> 18:42.622
and everything confirms what
the doctors in Mobile found.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.756
Mr. Sunberg

18:43.756 --> 18:44.991
is perfectly healthy.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.827
Even the mental evaluation
didn't raise any flags.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.029
Yeah, you see, George?
No earthly explanation.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.532
Am I the only one
who just got chills?

18:52.532 --> 18:55.268
Dr. Hart, can we have just a...
just a quick word?

18:55.268 --> 18:56.736
I'd rather
we didn't.
What?

18:56.736 --> 18:59.406
What? Nothing.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.140
So what's our
next step here?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.843
I mean, CT scan
or an MRI or...?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.978
Well, he's already had all
those tests done in Mobile.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.316
Maybe you should consider
that Mr. Sunberg made
the whole thing up.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.850
Why would he make it up?
Maybe the story

19:10.850 --> 19:13.786
makes him a celebrity
at Star Trek conventions.

19:13.786 --> 19:14.921
I don't know, George.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.723
Sometimes people just lie.

19:16.723 --> 19:20.059
Even the people we think
we know and like.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.594
(Eric mumbles)

19:21.594 --> 19:23.930
TOM:
Th-Th-The aliens are talking.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.400
(gasping and mumbling)

19:31.070 --> 19:33.206
Right pupil is nonreactive.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.343
You can't fake
nonreactive pupils.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.378
So I guess he's not lying.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.215
WADE:
 No, Joelle,

19:42.215 --> 19:44.717
you do not have
to shave your head.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.354
Or leave town.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.690
Look, just let me
figure this out, okay?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.225
Bartender?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.961
I will have a mint julep,
please.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.630
(chuckles)

19:57.630 --> 20:00.633
What? It's a perfectly
respectable drink.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.069
Yeah. If you're a hundred.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.771
Lemon...

20:04.771 --> 20:06.873
what are you doing here,
middle of the day?

20:06.873 --> 20:10.310
Shouldn't you be off,
you know, bossing someone
around somewhere?

20:11.278 --> 20:13.946
I... took the day off.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.815
Day off from what?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.284
Very funny.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.385
(sighs)

20:18.385 --> 20:20.253
George made me.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.255
"Relax, have fun,"
he said, you know?

20:22.255 --> 20:24.056
But I couldn't,
Wade, I couldn't.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.926
Lying there doing
nothing just made my
brain go into hyper-drive,

20:26.926 --> 20:30.897
and it just made me
more stressed out
than I already was.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.932
(clears throat softly)

20:32.932 --> 20:35.535
Oh, I didn't order this.
Yeah, well,

20:35.535 --> 20:38.237
mint julep won't
cure what ails you.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.940
Lemon, you know
how to have fun.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.243
All you got to do is,
you know... let go.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.678
Can't.

20:45.678 --> 20:49.015
Turns out Lemon Breeland
is just as anal and uptight

20:49.015 --> 20:50.883
as everyone thinks.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.286
* *

20:53.286 --> 20:54.954
Well, then...

20:54.954 --> 20:59.392
maybe you should stop being
Lemon Breeland for a night.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.000
LEMON:
Wade.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.168
Wade!
Hmm?

21:09.168 --> 21:10.770
Wade!
What?

21:10.770 --> 21:13.440
* *

21:13.440 --> 21:16.409
No one's ever gonna
believe I'm Joelle.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.645
(sighs) Look at me.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.347
I am.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.615
You look exactly
like Joelle.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.083
Damn, woman, you're hot!

21:24.083 --> 21:25.318
(laughs):
Shut up.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.553
I will not.

21:26.553 --> 21:27.887
Come on, let's go.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.923
Mmm! Rrr! Mmm!

21:37.029 --> 21:38.465
Hey, Zoe...

21:38.465 --> 21:40.467
Didi came over and apologized.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.034
We're back together.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.436
Fantastic.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.937
Hey, Zoe,
um... Oh.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.205
Sorry, I didn't...

21:46.205 --> 21:48.107
realize you had company.
Hey, Lavon.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.876
I'll just...
(slaps thigh)

21:49.876 --> 21:52.779
And George--
you remember George, right?

21:52.779 --> 21:54.847
Sweetest man in town?
Look, Zoe,

21:54.847 --> 21:56.849
um...

21:56.849 --> 21:59.352
I'd like to tell you everything.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.120
Can we please just

22:01.120 --> 22:03.723
take a walk and talk?

22:03.723 --> 22:05.257
I'm not in the mood to talk.

22:05.257 --> 22:08.761
I've already lied to Didi,
I'm lying to George.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.564
You've put me
in a terrible position.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.835
Thanks, Lavon.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.704
Thanks a lot.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.146
Anything?

22:27.146 --> 22:28.014
Unfortunately, no.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.281
Zoe, come on.

22:29.281 --> 22:30.282
Hello!

22:30.282 --> 22:31.718
I brought snacks.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.954
In honor of our Zoe's
cultural heritage... bagels!

22:34.954 --> 22:36.723
Or biscuits with
the middle cut out.

22:36.723 --> 22:37.690
Well, it looks
delicious,

22:37.690 --> 22:39.025
Tom, thank you so much.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.630
You really are a nice
guy, aren't you?

22:43.630 --> 22:45.064
DOTTY:
Honey, you should

22:45.064 --> 22:47.133
eat and drink something, too,
what with all that blood

22:47.133 --> 22:48.167
they took.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.436
Dotty, you got to get going

22:49.436 --> 22:50.670
if you're gonna conduct
the experiment.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.838
(sighs)
I'll be back

22:51.838 --> 22:54.040
as soon as I get
the data we need.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.207
But drink your juice.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.376
All right.

22:58.845 --> 23:03.049
Mr. Sunberg, do you
drink juice often?

23:03.049 --> 23:04.350
I do.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.719
May I?

23:06.719 --> 23:10.690
That tattoo, it's fading.

23:10.690 --> 23:11.891
Where did you get it?

23:11.891 --> 23:13.460
Well, I got that
on my wedding day.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.462
We were down in this
tiny town in Mexico.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.196
You know, it seemed
like the thing to do.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.999
Actually kind of gives me a
tough-guy rep with the kids,

23:19.999 --> 23:21.167
which is cool.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.769
(chuckling)

23:22.769 --> 23:25.605
I have a feeling it may have
given you more than that.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.940
I think your tattoo may have
given you lead poisoning.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.079
(country music playing)

23:35.548 --> 23:37.550
Stop, stop, stop.

23:37.550 --> 23:38.651
This is a bad idea.

23:38.651 --> 23:39.819
We're gonna get found out.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.320
We're gonna get
ourselves killed.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.856
Lemon, you've watched too
many Patrick Swayze movies.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.124
Now, you were
the one who said

23:45.124 --> 23:46.826
you didn't want to be
Lemon for a night.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.695
Well, this is your chance.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.498
Lemon,

23:51.498 --> 23:53.933
we're in Fairhope; nobody
knows who you are.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.001
They don't?

23:55.001 --> 23:56.636
You know, I don't like
the sound of that.

23:56.636 --> 23:57.904
I bet they've heard of me, okay?

23:57.904 --> 23:59.939
WADE:
No. Look, all we
need to do is find

23:59.939 --> 24:02.509
this Ed guy, and then convince
him that you were the one

24:02.509 --> 24:04.043
who was here with
me last night, okay?

24:04.043 --> 24:06.278
Then you can go home
and you can make lists

24:06.278 --> 24:07.514
and you can order
people around

24:07.514 --> 24:09.916
or whatever it is that
you do to have fun.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.919
No, no, what, what...

24:12.919 --> 24:14.053
Lemon, Lemon.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.087
What?

24:15.087 --> 24:17.223
You are no longer
uptight Lemon Breeland.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.791
You are super fun

24:18.791 --> 24:20.660
Roxy Rumley.
Yeah, who
apparently isn't

24:20.660 --> 24:23.362
scared of getting hepatitis.

24:23.362 --> 24:25.665
Yo, Bobby, beer me.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.133
Sure thing, Ed, my boy.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.773
And, uh, we'll take two
down here.

24:33.773 --> 24:38.277
Hey, weren't you
in here last night

24:38.277 --> 24:39.912
with a girl named Joelle?

24:39.912 --> 24:43.650
Well, you're right that I was
here, uh, last night, but, uh...

24:43.650 --> 24:45.417
But my sugar lips
was with me.

24:45.417 --> 24:46.418
Hm?

24:46.418 --> 24:47.520
And my name is Roxy.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.388
Yes, it is.

24:49.388 --> 24:50.857
Roxy.

24:50.857 --> 24:51.558
Mm-hmm.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.159
(chuckling)

24:54.393 --> 24:56.395
My mistake.

24:56.395 --> 24:58.297
Y'all have a good night now.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.266
It happens; take it easy.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.737
Sugar lips?

25:04.737 --> 25:06.873
Oh, my God, just tried to
think of, like, something

25:06.873 --> 25:08.608
I would never say
in a million years,

25:08.608 --> 25:10.442
and "sugar lips"
just kind of came right out.

25:10.442 --> 25:11.778
It was just so spontaneous!

25:11.778 --> 25:14.013
Just so exciting.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.548
The good news is,
I think he bought it.

25:15.548 --> 25:16.583
We can split.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.250
Wait.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.286
You know what else Lemon
really would never do?

25:20.286 --> 25:21.854
I really don't want to know.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.455
Shots with Wade Kinsella.
Bobby!

25:23.455 --> 25:24.891
Line them up!

25:24.891 --> 25:26.993
(giggles)

25:26.993 --> 25:31.297
The chelation challenge
confirms it.

25:31.297 --> 25:32.431
Lead poisoning.

25:32.431 --> 25:33.766
You are so smart.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.001
How did you know?

25:35.001 --> 25:38.137
Well, juice can have
traces of lead.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.939
For most people,
it's no problem.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.742
But for someone whose body is
already filled with toxins

25:42.742 --> 25:44.877
from a lead tattoo, it can

25:44.877 --> 25:46.879
exacerbate the symptoms.
Say it again.

25:48.480 --> 25:52.051
The good news is that lead
poisoning is easily treatable,

25:52.051 --> 25:54.253
so, Mr.Sunberg,
you should be fine.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.354
The good news

25:55.354 --> 25:56.689
for you is that lead can cause

25:56.689 --> 25:58.390
any number
of neurological symptoms.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.860
Like making you believe that you
were being controlled by aliens.

26:00.860 --> 26:01.894
Wait, what?
Look,

26:01.894 --> 26:03.262
all we got to do is tell

26:03.262 --> 26:05.598
the school board that you
had a medical condition.

26:05.598 --> 26:09.368
And as long as you promise not
to talk about UFOs and the like

26:09.368 --> 26:10.603
at any school functions,

26:10.603 --> 26:13.005
then we're gonna get
you your job back.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.041
So, you're telling me
that there is no chance at all

26:15.041 --> 26:18.544
that my spells were caused
by extraterrestrials?

26:18.544 --> 26:20.980
You are 100% alien-free.

26:22.782 --> 26:25.117
Zoe, thank you so much.

26:25.117 --> 26:27.219
Yeah.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.655
(sighs)

26:28.655 --> 26:30.056
I'm gonna go get some dinner,

26:30.056 --> 26:32.759
and then I will be back
in a while to check on you.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.061
George, I'm sure you
have to hurry off

26:35.061 --> 26:37.930
and go write some torts
or briefs or something.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.131
See you.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.671
(door closes)

26:44.671 --> 26:46.272
(door opens)

26:46.272 --> 26:47.807
Hey, Zoe.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.275
Hey, wait up.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.409
(laughs)
Hey!

26:50.409 --> 26:52.078
Jeez, I didn't realize
how fast you walked

26:52.078 --> 26:53.512
with those little
legs of yours.

26:53.512 --> 26:56.248
Oh, you know us New Yorkers.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.184
Hey, George, I got
your Save the Date.

26:58.184 --> 26:59.652
I'll see you there.
Oh. Great.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.821
I'll see you there.

27:01.821 --> 27:04.223
So, your Save the
Dates went out, huh?

27:04.223 --> 27:07.026
That's why you've been acting
so strange today, isn't it?

27:07.026 --> 27:07.960
What?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.461
You didn't get a
Save the Date.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.963
Um, I am so sorry.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.132
Oh, yeah, that's-that's
why I've been weird.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.433
Look, Zoe.

27:14.433 --> 27:17.770
I really want you to know that
I do consider you a friend.

27:17.770 --> 27:19.939
It's just, the wedding,
you know, is...

27:19.939 --> 27:23.542
I just want that to be
Lemon's special day.

27:23.542 --> 27:24.977
I hope you understand.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.914
So, you guys are doing
well, then, huh?

27:27.914 --> 27:30.149
Yeah, we're doing great.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.417
Actually, I mean,

27:31.417 --> 27:33.753
we had a rough patch after
the holidays, but she finally

27:33.753 --> 27:35.755
told me about some things
that had been going on.

27:35.755 --> 27:36.989
Really?

27:36.989 --> 27:38.457
She told you some things?

27:38.457 --> 27:41.928
Yeah. Yeah, she had, um...

27:41.928 --> 27:43.362
some problems with her family.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.865
And, you know, she'd
been dealing with that,

27:45.865 --> 27:47.633
but then she finally
decided to tell me,

27:47.633 --> 27:49.268
and now that she has,

27:49.268 --> 27:50.970
it's brought us
a lot closer, you know,

27:50.970 --> 27:53.139
and being a lawyer, I see
people split up all the time,

27:53.139 --> 27:55.207
you know, because they can't
be open with their partners.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.944
So, it feels good, to know that
we're gonna walk down the aisle

27:57.944 --> 28:00.312
without a secret
between us, you know?

28:02.715 --> 28:05.484
I'm really happy for you.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.755
(phone ringing)
Oh, sorry.

28:08.755 --> 28:11.323
Wade.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.591
Hi, Wade.

28:12.591 --> 28:13.893
(clears throat)

28:13.893 --> 28:15.895
(sighs)
Wait, who's-who's Roxy?

28:15.895 --> 28:17.029
Wait, what are
you talking...

28:17.029 --> 28:18.464
What? No, don't, just...

28:18.464 --> 28:20.032
You just, you stay there.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.634
You st... I'll be right there!
I'm sorry, I got to go.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.570
Uh, we'll talk
tomorrow? Yeah?

28:24.570 --> 28:25.772
Okay.
Okay.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.843
(exhales)

28:37.449 --> 28:39.451
(sighs)

28:42.188 --> 28:44.991
(line ringing)

28:44.991 --> 28:47.794
This is George Tucker;
please leave a message.

28:47.794 --> 28:51.063
(beep)
Hey, George, it's Zoe.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.065
Can you call me
when you have a chance?

28:53.065 --> 28:56.268
There's something
I need to tell you.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.874
(country music playing)

29:21.427 --> 29:23.662
Okay, you know, time to go.

29:23.662 --> 29:24.964
Why? This is so fun.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.698
I'm having so much fun.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.000
Lemon, you're drunk, okay?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.301
Who's Lemon?

29:29.301 --> 29:30.169
My name is Roxy.

29:30.169 --> 29:32.238
And Roxy wants
one more dance.

29:32.238 --> 29:36.408
You get one more dance, one
more, and then we're leaving.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.443
All right?

29:37.443 --> 29:38.577
Thank you, sugar lips.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.179
Whatever.

29:40.179 --> 29:41.447
* *

29:45.717 --> 29:47.786
How are you feeling?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.889
De-alienated.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.124
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

29:52.124 --> 29:53.125
Sure.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.793
Well, if my wife asks,

29:54.793 --> 29:55.962
don't tell her that
it was the tattoo

29:55.962 --> 29:57.563
that gave me lead poisoning.

29:57.563 --> 30:00.432
I don't have to tell her
anything you don't want me to.

30:00.432 --> 30:01.400
But why?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.402
I'm going to tell her
that it was

30:03.402 --> 30:05.704
an extraterrestrial
implantation device

30:05.704 --> 30:06.906
that gave me
lead poisoning,

30:06.906 --> 30:08.074
and that you
removed it

30:08.074 --> 30:09.909
and gave it to
the authorities.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.410
Why would you do that?

30:11.410 --> 30:14.146
Dr. Hart, I know
our beliefs may sound silly.

30:14.146 --> 30:18.517
They sounded silly to me...
before I met Dotty.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.887
And then she sold me.

30:20.887 --> 30:23.789
Believing something
else is out there--

30:23.789 --> 30:25.624
it's what makes

30:25.624 --> 30:27.626
Dotty and me us.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.962
We're happy.

30:29.962 --> 30:33.399
So, if a little lie
keeps us going,

30:33.399 --> 30:35.001
you know,
who's to say that's wrong?

30:36.468 --> 30:39.538
* *

30:39.538 --> 30:44.343
You know, you should be
real thankful you got Roxy

30:44.343 --> 30:45.277
and not Joelle.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.313
'Cause that girl is crazy.

30:47.313 --> 30:50.716
I was all set to
propose and everything,

30:50.716 --> 30:53.585
and then she saw me talking
to my female neighbor,

30:53.585 --> 30:55.621
talking, and that crazy girl

30:55.621 --> 30:57.156
set my clothes on fire.

30:57.156 --> 31:00.192
But you got a keeper
here, my friend.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.793
To Roxy!

31:01.793 --> 31:03.996
To Roxy.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.635
(laughing)

31:12.038 --> 31:14.840
Thank you, Lemon.

31:14.840 --> 31:18.477
You were... You went
above and beyond.

31:20.812 --> 31:22.181
You deserve better, you know.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.816
What are you talking about?

31:24.816 --> 31:26.785
I'm talking about Joelle.

31:26.785 --> 31:29.956
Burning a man's clothes
'cause she was jealous?

31:29.956 --> 31:32.091
Yeah, she's real
classy with a K.

31:32.091 --> 31:35.962
Well, thank you, uh,
but you're drunk.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.930
I am.

31:37.930 --> 31:42.501
But drunk or not,
Wade, I know you.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.637
We were friends once,
in high school.

31:45.637 --> 31:50.109
I always thought that you'd
rise above your upbringing

31:50.109 --> 31:53.145
and have a life as
big as your heart.

31:53.145 --> 31:57.216
I believe that
you deserve better,

31:57.216 --> 31:59.952
even if you think you don't.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.694
Oh, what?

32:08.694 --> 32:11.998
"Achy Breaky Heart" look out!

32:11.998 --> 32:13.565
Whoo!

32:13.565 --> 32:16.335
* *

32:28.747 --> 32:30.416
You have got to help me.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.684
Okay? I cannot get her
off the dance floor .
I bet.

32:32.684 --> 32:35.454
And she's, no, she's
gonna blow our cover.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.755
George, just remember
to call her...

32:36.755 --> 32:39.025
Roxy. Roxy, I got it.

32:39.025 --> 32:41.827
Oh, Georgie!

32:41.827 --> 32:43.695
(giggles)

32:43.695 --> 32:46.098
Roxy, I think it's time
about time to go home.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.733
Let's just go, let's go.
Oh, come on.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.268
Just do one dance with me.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.937
Hey, everyone, this
is my fiancé, George!

32:51.937 --> 32:54.306
Wait. I thought
she's with you.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.208
Well, see that's an
interesting question.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.909
Uh, it's-it's a
bit complicated.

32:57.909 --> 32:59.545
Wait a minute.
You're George Tucker.

32:59.545 --> 33:03.382
You defended my cousin
last year for tax evasion.

33:03.382 --> 33:04.916
Uh...

33:04.916 --> 33:07.953
Yeah. Nice
to see you.

33:07.953 --> 33:09.655
See, my fiancé-- he's a genius.

33:09.655 --> 33:10.822
Okay?

33:10.822 --> 33:12.424
You should come to our wedding!
Shouldn't he?

33:12.424 --> 33:14.160
I mean, y'all should come
to our wedding.

33:14.160 --> 33:14.960
What? Wedding?

33:14.960 --> 33:16.428
Yeah.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.529
Oh, you lying
son of a...

33:17.529 --> 33:18.430
Okay, run! Run!

33:18.430 --> 33:20.399
Run! Run! Run!
Come on, come on!

33:24.070 --> 33:26.938
Okay, look, you can tell
whoever you want to,

33:26.938 --> 33:29.908
but please, first,
let me explain.

33:29.908 --> 33:33.079
I'm not sure I want to hear
the sordid details, Lavon.

33:33.079 --> 33:35.281
It wasn't sordid.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.150
We were in love.

33:38.984 --> 33:41.687
You were in love?

33:41.687 --> 33:44.256
At least I was.

33:44.256 --> 33:48.127
It started
around Christmas

33:48.127 --> 33:50.162
last year.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.164
Lemon was going
through a hard time,

33:52.164 --> 33:54.066
George was in New York,

33:54.066 --> 33:56.535
and I was just trying
to be a good friend.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.937
But then,
something happened.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.972
We just...

34:00.972 --> 34:03.409
ran to each other
like it was home.

34:05.311 --> 34:07.246
We would, uh, just

34:07.246 --> 34:09.248
get in the car
and just drive,

34:09.248 --> 34:11.016
no idea where we were going.

34:11.016 --> 34:12.884
Sometimes we'd end up
at the beach,

34:12.884 --> 34:15.020
sometimes the woods,
sometimes

34:15.020 --> 34:17.255
some small town.

34:17.255 --> 34:20.025
For the first
and only time

34:20.025 --> 34:22.960
in my life I was in love,
and, uh...

34:22.960 --> 34:25.964
I saw a future
with us together.

34:25.964 --> 34:28.467
So, what happened?

34:30.302 --> 34:32.871
Six weeks in,
George came home...

34:32.871 --> 34:35.741
unexpectedly,

34:35.741 --> 34:37.176
and I was

34:37.176 --> 34:40.146
sure she was gonna
tell him the truth,

34:40.146 --> 34:43.982
that things were over
between them.

34:43.982 --> 34:46.618
But she didn't.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.454
He proposed,

34:48.454 --> 34:53.125
and she chose George...
instead of me.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.893
I'm sorry.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.762
And my heart broke.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.096
(laughs)

34:58.096 --> 34:59.331
My God.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.767
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, maybe, uh,

35:01.767 --> 35:03.569
she made the right decision.

35:03.569 --> 35:07.038
I mean, they-they...
they seem happy together.

35:07.038 --> 35:10.242
They do.

35:11.710 --> 35:16.315
Okay, look, if you... if you
need to tell George the truth...

35:16.315 --> 35:18.517
I'll understand.

35:20.018 --> 35:22.554
Do whatever
you think is right.

35:26.192 --> 35:28.394
(sighs)

35:29.995 --> 35:32.431
(phone ringing)

35:34.933 --> 35:36.435
(sighs)

35:36.435 --> 35:37.736
Hello.

35:37.736 --> 35:41.039
Hey, Zoe. Um, sorry it took me
so long to get back to you.

35:41.039 --> 35:42.808
What was it
you needed to tell me?

35:42.808 --> 35:44.776
Yeah, George, um...

35:47.379 --> 35:50.148
If Mrs. Sunberg asks,

35:50.148 --> 35:51.950
can you tell her

35:51.950 --> 35:55.787
the lead poisoning came
from an alien implant?

35:55.787 --> 35:57.789
(laughs)

35:57.789 --> 36:00.259
Well, okay, then.

36:02.127 --> 36:04.930
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.832
Okay.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.834
Bye.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.373
(knocking)

36:16.908 --> 36:18.777
How'd it go?

36:18.777 --> 36:20.346
Did you find Ed?

36:20.346 --> 36:22.080
Yeah. Yeah, I found him.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.251
Had a nice little chat, too.

36:26.785 --> 36:30.722
Tell me again why you, uh,
why you burned his lawn?

36:30.722 --> 36:32.791
What did he tell you?
Enough.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.661
Look, Joelle, I...

36:35.661 --> 36:37.929
I think maybe you ought to, uh,

36:37.929 --> 36:40.332
head back to Georgia after all.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.234
You're breaking up with me?

36:42.234 --> 36:44.970
Yup.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.772
Yeah, I am.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.774
Just need a little less crazy
in my life right now.

36:48.774 --> 36:49.841
Crazy?!

36:49.841 --> 36:51.209
Um...

36:51.209 --> 36:52.878
I'll show you crazy!
Now, now, hold on.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.179
That might not have
been the word I was...

36:54.179 --> 36:55.681
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Do not...

36:55.681 --> 36:56.848
Oh, my God.

36:56.848 --> 36:58.116
You... No.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.118
No, do not smash that!

37:00.118 --> 37:01.520
Oh, I'm not
gonna smash it.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.021
Don't worry.
Put the lighter down.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.523
JOELLE:
Say good-bye!
WADE:
Lighter down!

37:04.523 --> 37:06.124
I'd love for you
to try...

37:06.124 --> 37:08.260
That's my favorite...
Don't you call me crazy!

37:08.260 --> 37:09.861
Maybe we should
go help him?

37:09.861 --> 37:12.831
No, I think Wade can
take care of himself.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.633
(laughs)

37:14.633 --> 37:16.234
What about you?
How you feeling?

37:16.234 --> 37:18.069
You need, uh...
you need aspirin?

37:18.069 --> 37:19.838
Mm, no, I feel great.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.573
Oh.
Feel electric.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.774
Oh. Oh.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.476
Okay.
(laughing)

37:24.476 --> 37:26.478
My God, it has been so long

37:26.478 --> 37:28.547
since I have just
let loose like that.

37:28.547 --> 37:31.583
I had no idea
how much I needed it.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.752
(sighs)

37:33.752 --> 37:35.120
Thank you.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.755
Oh, no, don't thank me.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.658
I just really simply
said, uh, "Relax."

37:39.658 --> 37:42.494
I didn't say, "Get sloppy
drunk and go dancing

37:42.494 --> 37:45.731
under a fake name at a
roadhouse with Wade Kinsella."

37:45.731 --> 37:46.965
(laughs)

37:46.965 --> 37:48.266
Well, you know me.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.970
I never do anything halfway.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.972
Yeah.

37:53.972 --> 37:58.444
Well, I guess, tomorrow,
it's back to real life.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.483
I guess so.

38:07.152 --> 38:10.088
Well, I, for one,

38:10.088 --> 38:14.125
am not ready to say good-bye
to Roxy Rumley just yet.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.661
Hmm.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.663
What are you
thinking about?

38:17.663 --> 38:22.434
Well, why don't you follow me
and find out?

38:22.434 --> 38:24.870
(giggles)

38:29.875 --> 38:31.877
* *

38:39.184 --> 38:41.219
Hey, Dr. Hart!

38:41.219 --> 38:43.221
Thanks for all
your help.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.323
Too bad the Feds
showed up so soon

38:45.323 --> 38:47.359
and took that device away.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.995
I know. Damn Feds!

38:55.834 --> 38:57.836
(door opens)

39:08.079 --> 39:09.615
Hey.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.651
Hey.

39:14.486 --> 39:18.189
You know, I realize
that I can never presume

39:18.189 --> 39:19.925
to know what makes
a couple tick.

39:19.925 --> 39:24.496
Maybe George and Lemon
will live happily ever after,

39:24.496 --> 39:26.698
and the secret
will never come out.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.969
All I know is,
it's not my place to tell him.

39:35.641 --> 39:38.243
I'm sorry I ever put you
in this position.

39:38.243 --> 39:40.779
You're in a tough position, too.

39:40.779 --> 39:41.947
Yeah.

39:41.947 --> 39:45.250
Can't be easy to see
the two of them together.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.252
No.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.988
Do you still love her?

39:50.789 --> 39:53.592
Sometimes I think I might.

39:55.527 --> 39:58.029
Sometimes I think I'm over it.

39:59.965 --> 40:03.134
All I know--
I... I'm just trying to move on.

40:12.277 --> 40:14.913
* *

40:18.283 --> 40:20.486
(crickets chirping)

40:22.420 --> 40:26.725
(man and woman whooping
and laughing)

40:28.894 --> 40:31.029
(woman giggling)

40:31.029 --> 40:31.963
(laughter)

40:31.963 --> 40:34.265
LEMON: Oh, this is
the best day ever!

40:34.265 --> 40:37.869
(George laughs)
I didn't think
about anything.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.538
I just was totally
in the moment.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.339
I just went where
the day took me.

40:41.339 --> 40:43.174
I wish every day
could be like this.

40:43.174 --> 40:46.244
Oh, George,
we're not even 30 years old.

40:46.244 --> 40:49.080
We have the whole world right
in... right in front of us.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.182
Why don't we just be
running hell-bent towards it?

40:51.182 --> 40:53.451
We shouldn't be sitting here,
waiting and planning.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.920
That's not life, George.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.387
This is life.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.156
You and me, right here,

40:58.156 --> 41:00.158
right now.

41:00.158 --> 41:02.460
What are you saying?

41:02.460 --> 41:05.797
Let's elope.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.199
(laughter)

41:08.199 --> 41:09.835
Really?

41:09.835 --> 41:11.336
Yeah.

41:11.336 --> 41:13.539
(both laughing)

41:15.073 --> 41:17.075
(both whooping)

41:19.077 --> 41:23.481
