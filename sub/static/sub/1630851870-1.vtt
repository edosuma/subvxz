01:22.582 --> 01:23.875
[Dr. Levy] First of all,

01:23.958 --> 01:26.461
I'm gonna need you
to stop looking things up
on the internet.

01:26.544 --> 01:27.587
I am your doctor.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.380
If you have any questions,
you can come to me.

01:29.464 --> 01:30.882
[Eva] I know,
but I read a couple of articles

01:30.965 --> 01:32.634
so I know what
the charts look like.
And I just--

01:32.717 --> 01:34.636
Look, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

01:34.719 --> 01:35.929
We've already frozen your eggs.

01:36.012 --> 01:36.971
You are young.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.807
You still have time
to find a partner.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.099
I don't want a partner.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.893
So, if you're good
to take my money,
I'm good to go.

01:41.976 --> 01:44.020
You can put your legs down.
Everything looks great.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.773
You still have time.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.066
You sure you wanna
do this alone?

01:48.149 --> 01:50.276
I've done everything alone.
People are disappointing.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.028
If you want it done right,
you do it by yourself.

01:52.111 --> 01:54.030
It's a kid, not a coffee order.

01:54.113 --> 01:55.198
Ever since I was 12,

01:55.281 --> 01:56.699
I told my parents that
if I hadn't found the one

01:56.783 --> 01:59.327
by the time I was 30,
I would just do it by myself.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.454
I waited four extra years.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.832
I'm smart, I'm reliable,
I'm productive.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.583
And I want a baby.
And I'm not gonna wait,

02:05.667 --> 02:07.961
for what? Some idiot man
to break my heart

02:08.044 --> 02:09.254
and ruin my child?

02:09.337 --> 02:10.922
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

02:11.005 --> 02:14.509
Look, I want a kid
more than anything,

02:14.592 --> 02:16.302
but I want it on my own terms.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.721
Well, then, the next thing to do
is to find a donor.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.473
I actually already went
through the database

02:20.557 --> 02:22.976
and I found someone. 4-7-3-1.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.228
He's perfect.
He meets my criteria

02:25.311 --> 02:26.479
and he has a great essay.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.357
Well. It sounds like
you've got it all figured out.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.110
If you're sure,
then just make an appointment
with the reception.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.461

03:40.219 --> 03:42.430
Monica Reyes
sent these over for you.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.474
I also tried making
the doctor's appointment,

03:44.557 --> 03:48.144
but they said that
you already called
and did it yourself.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.605
You know I can do my job
if you let me.

03:50.688 --> 03:51.981
Yeah. No, I know.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.067
I just, uh,
had a little extra time,

03:54.150 --> 03:56.694
so I figured that I would just
take it off your plate.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.989
I am literally here to
take things off of your plate.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.240
How did it go?

04:01.324 --> 04:04.285
And before you say anything,
can I say something?

Don't do it. Just don't do it.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.383
Thirty-four is young!

04:18.466 --> 04:19.717
And, honestly,

04:19.801 --> 04:21.928
why would anyone want to bring
more people into the world?

04:22.011 --> 04:24.555

04:29.227 --> 04:30.436
I know I don't.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.896
Okay. First of all,
you're a guy.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.983
So, you don't have, like,
a biological need to procreate.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.776

to myself.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.029
So this is what I'm doing.

You're gonna ruin your life.

Don't you have some phone calls
to make or something?

-[Eva] Fuck.
-[both laugh]

09:29.735 --> 09:32.196
So, do you want me
to go with you today?

09:32.280 --> 09:36.742
Um, you know, they just
put a turkey baster up there.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.577
Can I get a chai tea latte
with almond milk

09:38.661 --> 09:39.829
and a little bit of cinnamon?

09:39.912 --> 09:40.955
And whatever she's getting.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.957
I'll have an Americano
with an extra shot.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.543
I just feel like you're gonna
be in the waiting room
for ten minutes.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.545
And that's it. So...

09:47.628 --> 09:49.046
I'm fine. I promise.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.549
Oh, my gosh!

09:51.632 --> 09:52.925
You're gonna be a mommy!

09:53.009 --> 09:55.303
[both squeal and giggle]

09:55.386 --> 09:56.470
[Dr. Levy] You see that?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.180
[serene music playing]

09:58.264 --> 10:01.809
That is the sperm being
injected into your uterus.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.103
Now, I want you
to stay positive.

10:04.186 --> 10:08.024
But the success rate
for a woman your age
is around 15%.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.609
I don't want you
to be disappointed
if we have to do it again.

This has never happened
before in my life.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.114
-Hi. Eva.
-Hi. Lorena.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.368
-Brian.
-A little about me,

13:06.452 --> 13:10.289
I am... [clears throat]
I'm half Mexican.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.707
[both speaking Spanish]

13:15.419 --> 13:17.296
So, anyway...

13:17.379 --> 13:19.548
I'm always, like,
switching back and forth,

13:19.632 --> 13:20.549
and I feel like

13:20.633 --> 13:22.551
I've really grown up
in both worlds.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.136
And I think in today's age,

13:24.220 --> 13:26.180
being Latin
and being in the US,

13:26.263 --> 13:30.518
-it's like there's
a whole new world of talent...
-[speaking Spanish]

13:30.601 --> 13:33.395
...and I wanna be the person
who represents them.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.565
My friend Arnulfo said that
you take very good care of him.

13:36.649 --> 13:40.402
Brian has been pushing for
a bigger management company,

13:40.486 --> 13:41.820
but I don't know.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.406
-I have this feeling, you know--
-[waitress] What can I get you?

13:44.490 --> 13:47.618
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna
have an Americano
with an extra shot,

13:47.701 --> 13:48.744
and whatever they're having.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.829
I want a matcha
with coconut milk, please.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.207
Iced coffee with
oat milk, thank you.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.750
Actually, no, I'm sorry. Um...

13:54.833 --> 13:56.794
I can't do... Okay.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.587
Uh, cappuccino.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.090
Can you check
how many milligrams of caffeine?

14:01.173 --> 14:03.133
You know what?
Actually, if you're already
gonna find out,

14:03.217 --> 14:06.220
can you also look up
green tea and a latte?

14:06.303 --> 14:10.891
How many milligrams
of caffeine per serving?

14:10.975 --> 14:13.727
And then get back to me,
and I'll decide.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.854
I'll, uh...
I'll try to figure that out.

14:15.938 --> 14:16.981
I'll be back.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.607
-Okay--
-[Eva] Oh! Actually,
you know what?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.277
Can you come back? Sorry.
You know, just scratch that

and, um, let's just do
a decaf cappuccino.

You guys really hot?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.340
No, it's pretty chilly in here.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.552
I'm a little off my game.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.220
[Brian] Are you sick?

14:48.304 --> 14:49.888
-She has a shoot next week.
-[Eva] I feel great.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.140
I feel great.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.434
So, we were talking
about the, uh...

14:53.517 --> 14:55.561
[slurring]
Why L-Latinos are really...

14:56.895 --> 14:58.314

15:06.905 --> 15:08.616
-[Brian] Yeah.
-No, I'm...

15:22.921 --> 15:24.256
<i>you're out of your mind.</i>

15:24.340 --> 15:26.508
Just tell the camera
where we're going.

15:26.592 --> 15:30.429
I'm going to
an ultrasound where

15:30.512 --> 15:34.183
hopefully, we'll hear
the heartbeat of my baby.

-[whispers] She means<i> our</i> baby.
-[laughs]

15:35.976 --> 15:38.354
And you're going to want
someone there to film it.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.733
-Put the phone down.
-What?

15:42.816 --> 15:46.111
Come on. I'm gonna
document everything,
so just get used to it.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.864
No, really, I think you should
put the phone down.

15:48.947 --> 15:50.866
-Put it down.
-Okay.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.703
Alright. Are you ready?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.455
I think I should go
on my own this time.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.378
What if it's like last time?

16:02.961 --> 16:04.838
Look, don't worry.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.216
This is nothing like last time.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.842
This time is
completely different.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.012
How do you know for sure?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.181
I just know.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.183
I promise.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.727
Now, let's go see our baby.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.313
-My baby. My uterus, my baby.
-Our baby. I'm the baby momma.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.565
-How many times
do I have to tell you?
-My baby inside of my body.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.566
<i>My baby.</i>

16:24.650 --> 16:26.819

-[doctor] You okay?

16:26.902 --> 16:30.197
Okay. Try not to move.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.158
Sorry. I'm emotional. [exhales]

16:37.955 --> 16:41.750
[doctor] Okay, if you
want me to record it,
try not to move for a moment.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.043
[Eva] Okay.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.128
[heart beating]

16:46.922 --> 16:48.173
[Eva giggles]

16:48.257 --> 16:50.843
[doctor] Yeah! Confirmed!

16:51.969 --> 16:53.262
Confirmed!

16:54.805 --> 16:56.890
Okay? You happy?

16:58.183 --> 16:59.101
Okay.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.353
[softly] I'm really happy.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.480
[Dr. Levy]<i> So,</i>
<i>everything is looking great.</i>

17:03.564 --> 17:06.150
Um, however, we did find
a small amount of fluid

17:06.233 --> 17:07.860
on the right side
of your uterus.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.279
-Fluid?
-It's just blood.
Should be fine.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.823
Should we be concerned?

17:12.906 --> 17:15.451
Most of the time,
it just gets re-absorbed
into the body.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.619
Um, it can cause some spotting

17:17.703 --> 17:19.997
and on very rare occasions,
a miscarriage.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.416
A miscarriage?

17:22.499 --> 17:25.002
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm gonna need
an exact percentage

17:25.085 --> 17:27.421
of what are the chances
that something can go wrong.

17:27.504 --> 17:29.798
Because, as you know,

17:29.882 --> 17:31.300
I've had a miscarriage before,

17:31.383 --> 17:33.218
so I just...
I can't take any chances.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.512
I-I need to be really informed

17:35.596 --> 17:37.473
and prepare for
whatever's happening next.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.142
'Cause I don't want
any surprises this time around.

17:40.225 --> 17:43.562
You will never be
completely informed
and prepared again.

17:43.645 --> 17:44.897
You're about to be a mom.

17:44.980 --> 17:45.981
[sighs in exasperation]

17:46.064 --> 17:47.816

Just try not to worry.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.901
Hope for the best.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.490
So, how did you two meet?

17:54.573 --> 17:56.617
-Oh, no. We're not...
-[laughs] Yeah, no.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.660
-She's not my girlfriend.
-[both laugh]

17:58.744 --> 18:00.412
We met in college.
We're roommates.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.705
But we live together.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.332
And then I'm having a baby,

18:03.415 --> 18:04.708
she's helping me with it.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.418
-It's complicated.
-[Skye gasps]

18:06.502 --> 18:08.170
-What?
-[squeals] You said it!

18:08.253 --> 18:09.463
-What?
-You said it.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.173
You said I'm helping you
with the baby.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.008
Well, I'm personally glad
she's got a friend to help her.

18:13.091 --> 18:14.927
She's gonna need all the help
she can get with the baby.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.012
I keep telling her that.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.264
I don't understand why
everyone keeps saying that.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.099
It's like I can have
a baby on my own.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.018
I run my own business, okay?

18:23.101 --> 18:25.020
I'm-I'm an independent woman.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.105
I do everything on my own.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.981
Why can't I have
a fucking baby on my own?

18:28.065 --> 18:30.567
Skye, my dad's coming at 1:00

18:30.651 --> 18:32.444
so please get out of here.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.071
And hide your weed shit.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.115
So, couldn't you
just freeze your eggs

18:36.198 --> 18:37.366
and wait a little?

18:37.449 --> 18:39.576
I already did that
two years ago.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.703

18:44.373 --> 18:46.250
<i>Why would you</i>
<i>just throw that away?</i>

18:46.333 --> 18:49.336
Mom, I'm gonna hire two more
managers in the next six months.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.004
Okay? I got this figured out.

18:51.088 --> 18:54.049
<i>Oh, really? You've got</i>
<i>single-motherhood figured out.</i>

18:54.132 --> 18:55.300
<i>Please enlighten me.</i>

18:55.384 --> 18:58.053
Okay. First of all,
I saw a study in Europe, okay,

18:58.136 --> 19:00.556
that talked about SMC,
Single Mother of Choice,

19:00.639 --> 19:01.765
and two-parent households.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.517
And it turns out,
that the children

19:03.600 --> 19:05.227
came out just the same in both.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.895
So, you're quoting Google now?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.606
Why do you want this so badly

19:09.690 --> 19:11.400
<i>and why now?</i>

19:11.483 --> 19:12.943
Because... [sighs]

19:13.026 --> 19:14.319
Do you remember Ryan?

19:16.113 --> 19:17.155
I was pregnant.

19:18.365 --> 19:22.077
-And... it didn't work out.
<i>-What?</i>

19:22.160 --> 19:25.080
So, anyway, the point is I...

19:25.163 --> 19:27.791
I can't keep my mind off
of it since then. I...

19:27.875 --> 19:29.585
I really want a baby.

19:29.668 --> 19:33.755
<i>I knew there was</i>
<i>more to that breakup</i>

19:33.839 --> 19:35.757
<i>Do you wanna talk about it?</i>
<i>Let's talk about it.</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:38.051
I just said I don't
wanna talk about it!

19:38.927 --> 19:41.638
I'm sorry that happened,
Eva, but...

19:41.722 --> 19:43.140
you know,
life is full of disappointments,

19:43.223 --> 19:46.310
and having a child
is not gonna change that.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.730
Okay, look. If you
don't wanna support me
in this journey, that's fine.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.565
Okay? I don't need your support.

19:51.648 --> 19:54.943
Actually, I don't need
anyone's help, okay?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.862
<i>Were you gonna</i>
<i>tell your dad about it</i>

19:56.945 --> 19:59.281
<i>And what about</i> abuelita?

19:59.364 --> 20:01.658
<i>Abuelita</i> would never
understand this.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.952
And Dad...

20:04.036 --> 20:06.622
[sighs] Dad was supposed
to be here 10 minutes ago.

20:06.705 --> 20:11.209
I was... gonna tell him
in person if he shows up.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.003
<i>He's no good with this stuff.</i>

20:13.086 --> 20:14.463
[Eva] What? What?

20:14.546 --> 20:16.673
Keeping his word?
Yeah, I know.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.177
And I still managed to...

20:20.260 --> 20:23.180
make plans with him like...
Fucking idiot.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.932
<i>How come he gets</i>
<i>a special meal</i>

20:25.015 --> 20:28.060
<i>and I get a FaceTime call while</i>
<i>you're peeing in front of me.</i>

20:28.143 --> 20:29.770
You get the "pee call."

20:29.853 --> 20:33.148
I get the pee call.
Thank you so much.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.527
I could--

22:42.611 --> 22:44.780
I don't know. Maybe,
I could drive over to you,

22:44.863 --> 22:47.240
or you could come here if,

22:57.375 --> 22:59.544

Please don't hate me.

23:32.285 --> 23:35.497
No! You said that we were
gonna stay in

23:35.580 --> 23:36.665
and watch a movie together.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.333
I know, but...

23:38.416 --> 23:39.417
I know you remember Crys.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.169
-The girl I've been dating.
-Mmm-hmm.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.630
It's her best friend's birthday
and she invited me to the party.

23:43.713 --> 23:45.882
You know, things are getting
serious between us,

23:45.966 --> 23:47.342
so it's kind of a big deal.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.052
I'm not going.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.930
Oh, my God.
Please come with me.

23:54.808 --> 23:55.809
Seriously.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.644
We made a plan.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.521
We said that tonight we were
going to stay together

23:59.604 --> 24:00.605
and we're gonna
a watch movie,

24:00.689 --> 24:01.982

looking forward to it.

24:02.065 --> 24:03.984
We don't always have to
stick to the plan.

24:04.067 --> 24:06.111
You know you can be
spontaneous, right?

24:07.112 --> 24:09.197

to the plan.

get dressed and go out

24:12.200 --> 24:13.743

I don't know.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.748

how you feel about her.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.251
So can you please get dressed
and come out with me?

24:25.881 --> 24:27.757

look like totally pregnant.

I just ate too much
or something.

<i>the envelope yet about</i>
<i>the gender reveal?</i>

<i>Because I cannot wait</i>
<i>to find out if it's a boy</i>
<i>or girl together.</i>

25:36.326 --> 25:37.661
I did.

25:37.744 --> 25:40.622
<i>I think it's a boy,</i>
<i>because I'm witchy like that.</i>

25:40.705 --> 25:41.748
Okay. All right.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.583
I'll take your bet,
we'll see what happens.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.543

25:45.627 --> 25:48.880
Yeah, I put the envelope aside,
like you asked,

25:48.964 --> 25:52.133
even though it's killing me.
Just so you know.

25:53.551 --> 25:56.137
So, actually, one of the reasons
I'm calling

25:56.221 --> 25:59.140
is because I think
you guys should
actually come home earlier.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.725
I've been reading
the news a lot,

26:00.809 --> 26:03.186
and I just feel like
this thing is getting
really out of control,

26:03.270 --> 26:06.773
and I just don't know
what that means for you and--

26:06.856 --> 26:08.358
<i>Well, I think it'll be fine.</i>

26:08.441 --> 26:10.610
<i>I mean, there's really</i>
<i>no cases of it here.</i>

<i>Everyone's just freaking out</i>
<i>because of the news.</i>

26:12.821 --> 26:14.364

<i>wash your hands,</i>

<i>stay six feet away from people,</i>
<i>and you'll be fine.</i>

26:19.202 --> 26:21.329
But they're saying that
it could get really bad.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.165
And I'm definitely going to
go do a grocery shop right now.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.960
I feel like we just need to have
some things in the house.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.169
I don't know.

26:28.253 --> 26:31.423
I think it can be more serious
than what you think.

26:31.506 --> 26:34.509
<i>Well, you do realize</i>
<i>that the news is made</i>

26:34.592 --> 26:36.678
<i>to put fear in you, right?</i>

So maybe you should take
a break from it for a while.

30:55.186 --> 30:56.396
So... [scoffs]

30:56.479 --> 31:00.066
I mean, you're just not gonna
come home?

31:00.149 --> 31:03.111
<i>Well, my girlfriend owns</i>
<i>a place here.</i>

31:03.194 --> 31:06.364
<i>and I figure it'd be easier</i>
<i>and safer and cheaper.</i>

31:06.447 --> 31:08.950
<i>And I just want</i>
<i>to weather the storm in Florida.</i>

31:09.033 --> 31:10.076
What the fuck?

31:11.202 --> 31:12.996
<i>I know.</i>
<i>You were right.</i>

31:13.079 --> 31:15.373
<i>Everything just started</i>
<i>escalating so quickly.</i>

31:19.085 --> 31:20.336
<i>Do you still have</i>
<i>the envelope?</i>

31:22.630 --> 31:23.631
[softly] Yeah.

31:25.383 --> 31:26.676
<i>Do you want to</i>
<i>open it together?</i>

31:28.386 --> 31:29.762
[Eva sighs]

31:33.057 --> 31:35.476
Who knew we were gonna find out
the gender of my baby

31:35.560 --> 31:37.854
during a fucking
zombie apocalypse.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.156
<i>What does it say?</i>

31:52.118 --> 31:53.578
It's a little boy.

31:53.661 --> 31:55.663
[Skye squeals in excitement]

31:55.747 --> 31:57.373
[excitedly]<i> Oh, my God!</i>

34:15.219 --> 34:17.180
[heart beating]

34:33.404 --> 34:34.447
Can we come in?

34:34.530 --> 34:37.784
[Eva] Oh, I prefer not,
actually. Sorry.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.160
We both have masks on.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.703
[Eva] Oh, yeah.

34:40.787 --> 34:42.997
I'm pregnant.
Okay. Sorry.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.165
-[man] Oh.
-[door thudding]

34:44.791 --> 34:46.000
[clicking]

34:46.083 --> 34:49.253
-[man] Okay then.
We'll just wait.
-Okay.

34:50.421 --> 34:51.506
[sighs in relief]

34:52.548 --> 34:55.051
[elevator whirring]

34:55.134 --> 34:57.845
<i>Hey, Eva, how are you</i>
<i>holding up?</i>

34:57.929 --> 35:00.014
Well, it's strange times,
for sure.

35:00.097 --> 35:02.892
But, you know, I always figured
I'd do this on my own.

35:02.975 --> 35:06.270
<i>There's a few things</i>
<i>that are changing,</i>
<i>actually, by the day.</i>

35:06.354 --> 35:07.855
<i>So I just wanted to call</i>
<i>and just give you</i>

35:07.939 --> 35:09.899
<i>a bunch of updates,</i>
<i>all at the same time.</i>

35:09.982 --> 35:11.400
-Okay.
<i>-Um...</i>

35:11.484 --> 35:14.028
<i>Unnecessary ultrasound</i>
<i>appointments are just</i>
<i>being canceled.</i>

35:14.111 --> 35:17.365
<i>You'll still have</i>
<i>your anatomy scan because</i>
<i>that one's very important.</i>

35:17.448 --> 35:20.868
<i>But for the appointment,</i>
<i>you'll need to wear</i>
<i>a mask and gloves,</i>

35:20.952 --> 35:23.704
<i>and you will be checked</i>
<i>outside, your temperature.</i>

35:23.788 --> 35:25.414
<i>It goes without saying,</i>
<i>you have to go</i>
<i>to the appointment</i>

35:25.498 --> 35:26.874
<i>completely on your own, okay?</i>

35:26.958 --> 35:30.127
-Well, I wasn't planning on
having anyone anyway.
<i>-Great.</i>

35:30.211 --> 35:32.338
<i>The other thing is...</i>
<i>delivery.</i>

35:32.421 --> 35:34.882
<i>I've talked to the hospital,</i>
<i>and it seems they are requiring</i>

35:34.966 --> 35:37.927
<i>women to deliver with</i>
<i>an N95 mask on.</i>

35:38.010 --> 35:39.720
<i>You cannot have anyone</i>
<i>in the room with you.</i>

35:39.804 --> 35:42.306
But if you do
wish to get a doula,
which I highly recommend,

35:42.390 --> 35:45.685
<i>they can be on</i>
<i>FaceTime with you</i>
<i>during the delivery.</i>

35:45.768 --> 35:49.480
[stammering] A doula?
Why would you recommend that?

35:49.564 --> 35:51.440
<i>Well, studies have shown</i>
<i>that it lowers your chances</i>

35:51.524 --> 35:53.651
<i>of having a C-section</i>
<i>by 50%.</i>

35:53.734 --> 35:55.570
<i>Having a support system</i>
<i>during the birthing process</i>

35:55.653 --> 35:58.406
<i>is actually very helpful</i>
<i>to both mother and baby.</i>

35:59.615 --> 36:01.367
Okay, um...

36:01.450 --> 36:03.911
Is there anything else that
I should be doing right now

36:03.995 --> 36:05.913
to be better prepared for...

36:05.997 --> 36:10.001
<i>Um... taking a hypnobirthing</i>
<i>or a Lamaze class?</i>

36:10.084 --> 36:11.711
<i>That would be really helpful.</i>

36:11.794 --> 36:14.046
<i>And you probably</i>
<i>would be able to do that online,</i>

36:14.130 --> 36:16.090
<i>which is a good idea</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

36:16.173 --> 36:18.801
Also, I'm not sure if you were
having a baby shower...

36:18.885 --> 36:22.638
My mom said that she would,
maybe, throw me one,
but I don't know.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.473
<i>Let's talk to your mom,</i>
<i>friends and just find out</i>

36:26.183 --> 36:28.853
<i>there are massive delays</i>

<i>since you we won't be able</i>

I don't have any...

36:32.148 --> 36:35.318
Well, my friends...
No one's a mom.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.864
<i>Do you need me to send you</i>
<i>some lists?</i>

36:39.947 --> 36:41.407
I mean, I've done
a bunch of research.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.492
[chuckles]
I have lists, but...

36:43.576 --> 36:46.579
Well... Yeah, I'll take a list.

36:46.662 --> 36:49.874
<i>Of course. No problem.</i>
<i>I will send that to</i>
<i>your e-mail. And, um...</i>

36:50.708 --> 36:51.792
<i>Things are so crazy right now,</i>

36:51.876 --> 36:53.628
<i>e-mail's probably</i>
<i>the best way</i>

36:53.711 --> 36:55.546
<i>to get in touch with me</i>
<i>for the time being.</i>

36:55.630 --> 36:57.590
<i>-Okay?</i>
-Mmm-hmm.

36:57.673 --> 37:00.760
<i>Great. So we will</i>
<i>talk again soon.</i>

37:01.344 --> 37:02.637
-Okay.
<i>-Okay.</i>

<i>Great. Bye.</i>

[assistant over phone]
<i>Wait, so are you firing me?</i>

37:47.223 --> 37:49.684
[Eva] At least you can file
for unemployment, okay?

37:49.767 --> 37:51.435
I'm technically self-employed

37:51.519 --> 37:53.688
and this SBA website
is a fucking nightmare.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.773
I don't even know
if I qualify.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.483
[speaking Spanish]

37:57.566 --> 37:59.485
There's no money
coming in, okay?

37:59.568 --> 38:03.197
I can barely afford my own rent,
let alone the office rent.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.491
<i>Well, I can't pay</i>
<i>my rent either now.</i>

38:06.033 --> 38:07.284
[sighs] I don't...

38:08.577 --> 38:10.246
I don't know what else to do.

38:10.329 --> 38:12.665
I was already thinking
about moving to Mexico.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.334
Now there's nothing
holding me back.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.627
Maybe this is a sign.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.047
<i>Is there anything I can</i>
<i>help you with</i>

38:20.131 --> 38:22.508

<i>and planning my leaving?</i>

38:23.551 --> 38:24.552

38:24.635 --> 38:26.345
Is anybody helping you?

38:26.429 --> 38:28.055
I got it figured out.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.641
You're a hard-ass.
[scoffs]

38:30.725 --> 38:34.353
But I have enjoyed
working for you so much.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.191
I will.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.317
I will keep you posted.

<i>We don't know</i>
<i>if it's a boy or a girl.</i>

<i>-We're just gonna be surprised.</i>
<i>-Oh, yeah.</i>

39:43.297 --> 39:45.299
<i>Is it going speak in</i>
<i>an Australian accent?</i>
[laughs]

39:45.382 --> 39:49.303
<i>-I mean, I hope so.</i>
<i>We're a bit strange.</i>
<i>-Maybe.</i>

I'm Eva and I don't

<i>He's actually in</i>
<i>the front line,</i>

<i>taking care of</i>
<i>all of us, you guys.</i>

40:23.963 --> 40:25.005

40:25.089 --> 40:26.173
[all clapping]

40:26.257 --> 40:28.926
<i>That's why he couldn't</i>
<i>be here with me, but...</i>

40:29.009 --> 40:30.344
<i>Well, he's there.</i>

40:30.427 --> 40:32.513
<i>So, Eva, you're a single mother</i>
<i>by choice?</i>

40:32.596 --> 40:33.848
<i>I just wanted to circle back.</i>

40:33.931 --> 40:35.808
-[Eva]<i> Yeah.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

40:35.891 --> 40:37.476
<i>No, that's very brave.</i>

40:37.560 --> 40:39.728
<i>It's gonna be the best decision</i>
<i>you ever made</i>

<i>for the rest</i>
<i>of your life.</i> [laughs]

41:04.503 --> 41:05.546
[Eva] Hi.

41:05.629 --> 41:06.547
[man] Hi.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.633
[Eva] Oh, how are
deliveries going?

41:10.926 --> 41:11.969
Fine.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.056
Well, uh, do you feel
like you're safe
at least, you know?

41:16.640 --> 41:17.683
It is what it is.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.729
How many have you had today?

41:23.272 --> 41:27.610
I'm double-parked,
so I gotta go.
Have a good day, though.

41:27.693 --> 41:28.986
Okay, um...

41:32.865 --> 41:33.991
[video call ringing]

41:35.492 --> 41:37.119
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>

41:37.203 --> 41:39.413
<i>Uh, when is your</i>
<i>due date again?</i>
<i>Remind me.</i>

41:40.080 --> 41:41.999
Uh, August 29th.

41:42.082 --> 41:44.710
Uh, I'm sorry.
Are you a little young
to be a doula?

41:44.793 --> 41:46.670
<i>I'm more of just</i>
<i>an energetic support.</i>

41:46.754 --> 41:49.590
<i>Not the lady that sews up</i>
<i>your vagina afterwards, so...</i>

41:49.673 --> 41:52.885
Okay. Yeah, Well, that's
good to know. 'Cause I...

41:52.968 --> 41:56.013
definitely want that person
to have gone to medical school.

41:56.096 --> 41:57.473
-No offense.
<i>-None taken.</i>

41:57.556 --> 42:00.142
-Okay.
<i>-Yeah. So would I.</i> [laughs]

42:00.226 --> 42:02.561
I'm not totally sure like what,

42:02.645 --> 42:06.065
what you guys do,
but it seems like it
could be really beneficial.

42:06.148 --> 42:11.153
<i>We are very well educated</i>
<i>on what is going on in your body</i>

42:11.237 --> 42:14.615
<i>throughout your pregnancy</i>
<i>as well as your</i>
<i>birthing process.</i>

42:14.698 --> 42:19.995
<i>If you become exceptionally</i>
<i>filled with fear or anxiety,</i>

42:20.079 --> 42:22.623
<i>you can basically go</i>
<i>into a state of panic,</i>

42:22.706 --> 42:25.751
<i>and the body responds</i>
<i>the same way.</i>

42:25.834 --> 42:27.920
<i>And so then you've got</i>
<i>this clenched body</i>

42:28.003 --> 42:30.256
<i>and that's</i>
<i>a lot more difficult.</i>

42:30.339 --> 42:32.508
<i>to let a baby out of.</i>

42:32.591 --> 42:34.885
So is it kind of like...

42:34.969 --> 42:37.680
[exhales] I guess what
a husband would do if I...

42:38.472 --> 42:40.307
I had one.

42:40.391 --> 42:45.646
<i>To be honest, the, the spouses</i>
<i>are usually freaking out</i>
<i>a little bit themselves.</i>

42:45.729 --> 42:50.067
[sighs] I mean,
this does sound...
It sounds really nice.

42:50.150 --> 42:51.485
Um... [clicks tongue]

42:51.568 --> 42:54.154
The world is obviously
in a strange place,

42:54.238 --> 42:58.867
and um, there's a lot
of stuff I'm trying to
figure out financially.

42:58.951 --> 43:03.664
But, um, but could you maybe
send me a rate sheet
or something like that?

43:03.747 --> 43:05.082
Do we really need the masks?

43:05.165 --> 43:07.209
-I promise I'll stay
on my towel.
-[Eva] Okay, but back up.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.544
Okay.

43:08.627 --> 43:10.879
Lift your shirt up.
I wanna see your belly.

43:11.797 --> 43:14.425
Oh, you're huge, huh?

43:14.508 --> 43:17.469
I'm not huge.
Huge is a terrible word.

43:17.553 --> 43:19.471
Don't you remember
being pregnant at all?

43:20.180 --> 43:21.265
I was always tiny.

43:21.348 --> 43:24.143
I gained, like, 15 pounds
the whole pregnancy.

43:24.226 --> 43:25.811
Well, that's not even healthy.

43:25.894 --> 43:28.731
I am perfectly normal weight.

43:29.523 --> 43:30.566
I'm not insulting you.

43:30.649 --> 43:32.192
I just think it's fun.
You have a big belly.

43:32.276 --> 43:33.694
Okay, enough with the belly.

43:34.611 --> 43:36.780
-You look great.
-Thanks.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.032
So how you doing with all this?

43:38.115 --> 43:40.701
It is such strange times.

43:41.994 --> 43:44.079
Yeah, it is.

43:44.163 --> 43:45.748
I've been doing a lot
of budgeting,

43:46.582 --> 43:47.875
a lot of accounting.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.210
Listen, Eva, I wanted to talk
to you about the baby shower.

43:50.294 --> 43:52.880
So I was thinking between
your girlfriends,

43:52.963 --> 43:55.049
and then our family
and our distant family,

43:55.132 --> 43:57.718
I think we could actually just
get everything on the registry,

43:57.801 --> 43:59.595
which would be amazing.

43:59.678 --> 44:03.891
You really think it's
appropriate to ask people to buy
you things at a time like this?

44:04.850 --> 44:05.934
I will get you the crib.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.022
Mom, I was counting
on this baby shower.

44:10.939 --> 44:13.942
Since when did you
count on anyone?

44:14.026 --> 44:17.613
Since I'm not making
any money and I'm putting
everything on my credit card,

44:18.864 --> 44:20.032
You should ask your dad.

44:20.115 --> 44:22.493
[scoffs] Yeah, right.

44:22.576 --> 44:26.121
But maybe this is actually
a chance for him to step up
and be a parent. You know?

44:27.331 --> 44:29.416
He doesn't even know
I'm pregnant.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.126
I thought you guys
had the big dinner.

44:33.712 --> 44:35.172
He is such a dick!

44:35.798 --> 44:37.424
[chuckles]

44:37.508 --> 44:38.967
I don't even want
to talk about it.

44:40.386 --> 44:42.096
Look, honestly...

44:43.222 --> 44:45.641
[sighs] that's why I don't
count on anyone.

44:45.724 --> 44:47.726
Everyone's a huge
disappointment.

44:47.810 --> 44:49.103
Eva, don't be like that.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.897
We're going to figure this out.

44:51.980 --> 44:52.940
No we're not.

44:53.023 --> 44:56.485
I'm gonna figure it out
like I always do.

44:58.404 --> 44:59.613
[Skye]<i> Hi.</i>

44:59.696 --> 45:01.782
Hey. So okay, I got upstairs.

45:01.865 --> 45:04.868
It's really intense. They like
checked my temperature
and everything

45:04.952 --> 45:06.120
before they let me in.

45:06.537 --> 45:07.579
But look.

45:09.289 --> 45:11.750
<i>Oh, perfect,</i>
<i>you're already</i>
<i>in an exam room.</i>

45:11.834 --> 45:13.293
Mmm-hmm.

45:13.377 --> 45:16.630
Yeah so, anyway I'm really
excited that you're here
on the call with me.

45:18.215 --> 45:20.342
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't</i>
<i>be there in person.</i>

45:20.426 --> 45:22.636
No, actually, they're not
letting anyone in.

45:22.719 --> 45:25.889
So I guess,
it doesn't matter [chuckles]

45:25.973 --> 45:27.975
They have this, like,
whole thing set up

45:28.058 --> 45:33.147
for like, partners,
support system,
like, husbands...

45:33.230 --> 45:35.691
to see the ultrasound
at the same time.

45:35.774 --> 45:37.818
So I'm gonna prop
you up, and then you're
going to be able

45:37.901 --> 45:39.236
to see the screen with me.

45:39.862 --> 45:42.948
Um, of the baby okay?

45:43.031 --> 45:45.784
<i>-Okay. I can't wait</i>
<i>to see our baby.</i>

[on phone]<i> Hey, Eva,</i>
<i>it's Dr Levy.</i>

45:52.750 --> 45:54.376
<i>I got a chance to</i>

45:54.460 --> 45:57.421
<i>Uh, everything's looking great,</i>
<i>but we will actually need</i>

45:57.504 --> 45:59.631
<i>to have you come in</i>
<i>for the next anatomy scan,</i>

45:59.715 --> 46:02.759
<i>even though we're skipping most</i>
<i>of the unnecessary ultrasounds.</i>

46:02.843 --> 46:05.137
<i>You have something called</i>
<i>velamentous cord insertion.</i>

46:05.220 --> 46:07.681
<i>Shouldn't be a big deal.</i>
<i>I just want to get it</i>
<i>checked out.</i>

46:07.764 --> 46:08.765
<i>Great, thanks.</i>

46:29.786 --> 46:32.206
[stammering] Lauren. Hi. Sorry.

46:32.289 --> 46:37.127
Um, I just was told that
I have this thing called
velamentous cord insertion.

46:37.211 --> 46:40.047
And no one's picking up,
the doctor's not picking up,

46:40.130 --> 46:41.507
my mom's not picking up.

46:41.590 --> 46:43.467
And don't know if
you've heard of this
but I'm freaking out.

46:43.550 --> 46:48.555
I just looked it up online
and then there's so many
horrible things in there.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.724
I don't know what to do.
[crying hysterically]

46:50.807 --> 46:52.434
I'm having
a panic attack right now.

46:53.352 --> 46:55.062
What?

46:55.145 --> 46:58.690
<i>It's okay. First things first,</i>
<i>put your hand on your belly</i>
<i>and take a deep breath</i>

46:58.774 --> 47:01.276
Okay, okay.

47:01.360 --> 47:04.112
<i>Say hello to the baby.</i>

Is the baby okay?
<i>-You're okay.</i>

47:07.282 --> 47:11.119

47:16.708 --> 47:19.503
<i>I just want you</i>
<i>to breathe, okay?</i>

47:19.586 --> 47:22.589
<i>Now, the biggest question</i>
<i>we're gonna ask your doctor</i>

47:22.673 --> 47:24.299
<i>is where the cord is.</i>

47:24.383 --> 47:26.552
Okay, let me write this down.

47:26.635 --> 47:28.595
[Lauren]<i> It can be closer</i>
<i>to the fundus.</i>

47:28.679 --> 47:30.722
-[Eva] Okay.
-[Lauren]<i> or the cervix.</i>

47:30.806 --> 47:32.975
[Lauren]<i> So the fundus</i>
<i>is much better.</i>

47:33.058 --> 47:34.476
<i>But regardless,</i>

47:34.560 --> 47:38.605

[Lauren]<i> I know,</i>
<i>online it paints</i>
<i>a different picture,</i>

47:43.193 --> 47:45.612
<i>because there's</i>
<i>all these stories</i>

47:45.696 --> 47:48.657

<i>and it can create all this fear.</i>

47:48.740 --> 47:51.285

it was pretty harsh.

all the answers.

1:12:08.824 --> 1:12:11.160
<i>Yeah, she does.</i>
<i>But, I mean, that's not enough</i>

1:12:11.243 --> 1:12:13.662
<i>for her to attach herself</i>
<i>because she's extremely busy.</i>

1:12:13.746 --> 1:12:16.331
<i>She has three projects</i>
<i>that she...</i>

1:12:18.083 --> 1:12:19.293
<i>What's going on with you?</i>

1:12:20.669 --> 1:12:21.670
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1:12:23.338 --> 1:12:24.840
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>You listening?</i>

1:12:28.177 --> 1:12:30.471
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Yeah.

1:12:30.554 --> 1:12:36.060
Um, yeah!
I think we should all just
jump on a Zoom call...

1:12:39.313 --> 1:12:43.942
<i>Right. This again. Okay,</i>
<i>I got to get going. I've seen</i>
<i>and heard enough.</i>

1:12:44.026 --> 1:12:45.903
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

1:12:45.986 --> 1:12:50.407
Um... Wait. No, I'm pregnant.
I think I'm having contractions.

1:12:52.034 --> 1:12:53.077
<i>You're pregnant?</i>

1:12:53.702 --> 1:12:54.787
Yeah.

1:12:54.870 --> 1:12:57.206
<i>Is that why you were</i>
<i>throwing up after we met?</i>

1:12:58.082 --> 1:13:00.417
-What?
<i>-I thought you had COVID.</i>

1:13:00.501 --> 1:13:03.712
No, no. That was
morning sickness. [chuckles]

1:13:10.219 --> 1:13:11.929
<i>You gotta take it easy.</i>

1:13:13.764 --> 1:13:16.308
<i>Okay? Take it easy. And...</i>

1:13:17.476 --> 1:13:19.061
<i>Are you having</i>
<i>another contraction?</i>

1:13:19.144 --> 1:13:23.482
Yeah, I think I'm...
I think I'm gonna call
my doula right now.

1:13:23.565 --> 1:13:25.025
-Yeah.
<i>-Okay, good...</i>

1:13:25.109 --> 1:13:28.654
<i>-Hey, congratulations!</i>
-Oh, thanks! [laughs]

1:13:28.737 --> 1:13:33.033
<i>-I have three kids.</i>
<i>You're gonna have a blast.</i>
-Thanks.

1:13:33.117 --> 1:13:37.538
<i>-Boy or girl?</i>
-Oh, boy. Okay,
talk soon. Bye.

1:13:37.621 --> 1:13:39.540
<i>I'll be seeing you. Bye!</i>

1:13:48.298 --> 1:13:52.636
<i>Hi, this is Lauren.</i>
<i>I am with a client off-grid</i>
<i>for the next couple of days.</i>

1:13:52.719 --> 1:13:56.265
<i>If this is an emergency</i>
<i>or you are in labor,</i>
<i>please call Dana</i>

1:13:56.348 --> 1:14:01.019
<i>at 323-333-6533.</i>

1:14:01.103 --> 1:14:04.148
<i>She is aware of all my clients,</i>
<i>is a certified doula</i>

1:14:04.231 --> 1:14:06.150
<i>and is ready to jump in</i>
<i>in a moment's notice.</i>

1:14:06.233 --> 1:14:09.444
Eva? I'm Dana. I'm Lauren's
replacement.

1:14:09.528 --> 1:14:11.238
How you doing?

1:14:11.321 --> 1:14:16.201
I've had five contractions
since the last message
that I sent you.

1:14:16.910 --> 1:14:18.328
[Dana] Having another one?

1:14:18.412 --> 1:14:20.706
-Yeah.
-Okay, just find that breath.

1:14:20.789 --> 1:14:24.001
-[vocalizing]
-Good. Send it deep
into your body.

1:14:26.879 --> 1:14:29.923
-[shrieking]
-Keep it up.
Find that breath.

1:14:30.757 --> 1:14:33.677
[vocalizing]

1:14:34.595 --> 1:14:36.722
[vocalizing]

1:14:36.805 --> 1:14:40.934
Just breath. Eva, changing
position could make it
a little more intense.

1:14:41.018 --> 1:14:43.228
[Eva shrieking]

1:14:43.312 --> 1:14:47.524
-[Dana] Good. Breathe,
breathe, breathe.
-[exhales loudly]

1:14:47.608 --> 1:14:50.652
-[Eva vocalizing]
-[Dana] You're doing great.

1:15:00.329 --> 1:15:04.917
-[Eva] I'm definitely ready
for an epidural.
-[Dana] Yeah!

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:06.960
[Dana] Nice and slow.
Let's not rush to the car.

1:15:07.836 --> 1:15:08.879
[Eva] Okay.

1:15:13.509 --> 1:15:15.594
-[Eva] Thank you.
-[Dana] Yeah, of course.

1:15:16.428 --> 1:15:17.554
My pleasure.

1:15:20.641 --> 1:15:22.601
-[Dana] You got the door?
-[Eva] Yeah.

1:16:23.495 --> 1:16:28.083
[nurse] Are you feeling pain
or just uncomfortable,
like the shaking and stuff?

1:16:28.166 --> 1:16:31.461
-Um...
-[woman] You'll need
to check her.

1:16:31.545 --> 1:16:33.505
But the contractions...
I'm starting to feel.

1:16:33.588 --> 1:16:36.341
[nurse] You're starting
to feel it? You want to
press your button again?

1:16:36.425 --> 1:16:38.802
Yeah, but I already
pressed it twice.

1:16:38.885 --> 1:16:41.763
[nurse] You did?
Again, you pressed it? Okay.

1:16:41.847 --> 1:16:43.974
Let me see if we can
give you a little more.

1:16:47.227 --> 1:16:50.439
[Eva] But it won't affect
his heart, right?

1:16:50.522 --> 1:16:53.191
[nurse] Right,
let's try and get you
on your back first

1:16:53.275 --> 1:16:56.194
so we can place
the epidural bag.

1:16:56.278 --> 1:16:58.405
[nurses speaking indistinctly]

1:16:58.488 --> 1:17:04.661
[Eva] The baby's
heart rate drops like,
an unusual amount, and...

1:17:04.745 --> 1:17:07.873
They're a little worried
that there's a cord somewhere.

1:17:07.956 --> 1:17:10.500
We're trying to figure out
how to...

1:17:10.584 --> 1:17:15.714
do this as easily as possible
without affecting his heart.

1:17:15.797 --> 1:17:18.800
[Dana on phone]<i> Yeah,</i>
<i>it's so hard. I'm so sorry.</i>

1:17:18.884 --> 1:17:20.969
<i>Cord compression</i>
<i>can be a very real thing.</i>

1:17:21.053 --> 1:17:24.848
<i>-It's a very...</i>
<i>It can be dangerous.</i>
-I did everything right.

1:17:24.931 --> 1:17:28.352
[sobbing] We went into
natural labor and everything.

1:17:29.061 --> 1:17:31.063
[shivering]

1:18:07.391 --> 1:18:12.020
[Dr. Levy]<i> Eva, we've been</i>
<i>turning you every 20 minutes</i>
<i>for the last six hours</i>

1:18:12.104 --> 1:18:14.314
<i>to try to shift</i>
<i>the baby's position.</i>

1:18:14.398 --> 1:18:18.110
<i>Nothing is working.</i>
<i>We're going to have to do</i>
<i>an emergency C section.</i>

1:19:22.591 --> 1:19:26.636
Hi! Hi.
[speaking Spanish]

1:19:27.679 --> 1:19:29.264
[speaking Spanish]

1:19:29.347 --> 1:19:31.433
[gasps] Ooh!

1:19:32.434 --> 1:19:33.518
Ooh!

1:19:35.312 --> 1:19:36.897
[blows raspberry]

1:19:43.653 --> 1:19:48.450
Every single piece
of this entire pregnancy...

1:19:48.533 --> 1:19:55.665
it was absolutely worth it
because you are perfect.

1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.419
You're what I've waited for
my whole life.
