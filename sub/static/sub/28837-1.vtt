02:04.425 --> 02:06.225
         It's so rural.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.526
   At least we are no longer
       on a motor coach.

          -[chuckles]

03:33.514 --> 03:35.347

  Ooh, what's the ghost light?

03:54.468 --> 03:55.567
            That...

03:55.569 --> 03:57.186
      is the ghost light.

03:57.187 --> 03:58.804
       And it must always
         remain burning

03:58.806 --> 03:59.972

             are...

04:47.488 --> 04:50.355

04:50.357 --> 04:52.724
      the way to dusty...

04:53.394 --> 04:54.559
             death.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.330
       You are really...

04:58.332 --> 04:59.931
       starting to embody
        this role, Alex.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.450
              Hmm?

05:01.451 --> 05:02.968
     You're really starting
      to embody this role.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.970
Ah, yeah, it did feel different,
           didn't it?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.405
      -Didn't you feel it?
         -[Alex] Yeah.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.640
          -I felt it.
         -[Alex] Yeah.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.677
      But I would say that
   the Scottish King himself,

05:11.679 --> 05:13.345
  could not have done better.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.614
     -[Alex] Oh, thank you.
    -Oh, because he's dead?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.049
        [Elliot groans]

05:17.051 --> 05:18.583
       Pay no attention.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.719
    Every line, remembered.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.454
         No easy task.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.855
      -[Elliot] Well done.
          -Thank you.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.724
            Welcome!

05:25.726 --> 05:26.825
       Welcome, everyone.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.393
  This is George Pitard, he...

05:28.395 --> 05:30.245
    he owns the place. Wow.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.096
    Well, we sometimes think
        it does own us.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.866
          [all laugh]

05:33.867 --> 05:35.634
  What a charming old theater.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.937
  [George] Ah, merci beaucoup,
         mademoiselle!

05:38.939 --> 05:40.605
              Oh.
           [smooches]

05:41.575 --> 05:43.091
             Uh...

05:43.092 --> 05:44.608
  my grandfather, he build it.

05:44.611 --> 05:47.612
[George] We close for two years,
   but decided to open again

05:47.614 --> 05:50.015
      now that the tourism
         is picking up.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.617
     -For the leaf peepers.
          -[chuckles]

05:52.619 --> 05:54.786
     Oh, and you are doing
         the play Mac--

           [blabbers]

05:56.090 --> 05:59.024
   Oh,<i> The Play Scottish, eh?</i>

05:59.026 --> 06:01.727
          Perfect, no?
  Right where we left it off.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.595
     I'm guessing it was...

06:03.997 --> 06:05.564
      It was very popular.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.132
             Uh...

06:07.134 --> 06:08.767
          Not so much.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.405
       -[trunk clatters]
        -[men grunting]

06:13.407 --> 06:15.741
What the hell does Madeline keep
         in this thing?

06:15.743 --> 06:16.908
         An ex-husband.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.678
          [bird caws]

06:20.047 --> 06:22.047
     Do you have any bars?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.682
      [Troy sighs deeply]

06:26.053 --> 06:28.053
         Nope. No bars.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.089
             Wi-Fi?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.124
This look like the kind of place
     that has Wi-Fi to you?

06:32.126 --> 06:33.792
  You've got to be kidding me.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.794
   Even Appalachia had Wi-Fi.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.631
      [Nigel] I'm waiting
        for a callback.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.099
      You've been waiting
       for that call back

06:41.101 --> 06:42.667
   as long as I've known you.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.539
             Ouch.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.011
            [thuds]

06:56.116 --> 06:58.850
  [Henry] You know, Madeline,
      I've been thinking,

06:58.852 --> 07:00.719
       this theater is...

07:00.721 --> 07:02.087
        is so intimate.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.389
        It's beautiful.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.690
   Maybe you should tone down
     your third witch just,

07:06.693 --> 07:08.427
      just a little here.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.963
   What... what do you mean?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.200
            Well...

07:15.202 --> 07:17.502
  this is Shakespeare, it's...

07:17.504 --> 07:19.871
      It's not Vaudeville.
           [chuckles]

07:21.608 --> 07:22.841
          Vaudeville?

07:24.845 --> 07:27.846
 I received spectacular reviews

07:27.848 --> 07:30.749
 for my first witch in London.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.918
     With Mr. Derek Jacobi.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.820
          I remember,

07:34.822 --> 07:37.589
  but the witches should be...

07:37.925 --> 07:39.524
          malevolent.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.560
             Not...

07:41.862 --> 07:43.061
          hysterical.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.565
          Hysterical?

07:47.734 --> 07:50.502
  [Madeline] Shall I show you
         the difference

07:50.504 --> 07:53.505
       between malevolent
        and hysterical?

07:53.507 --> 07:55.991
            Oh, boy.

07:55.992 --> 07:58.476
  I am done with your insults

07:58.479 --> 08:01.213
      and lack of talent.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.782
    Now that was malevolent

08:03.784 --> 08:05.984
    and this is hysterical.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.954
            Macbeth!

08:08.956 --> 08:10.222
            Macbeth!

08:10.224 --> 08:12.657
  [Madeline] Macbeth! Macbeth!

08:12.659 --> 08:13.758
            Macbeth!

08:13.760 --> 08:15.410
            Macbeth!

08:15.411 --> 08:17.061
       -Macbeth! Macbeth!
-[Annabel] Hey, what's going on?

08:18.031 --> 08:19.815
      [Madeline] Macbeth!

08:19.816 --> 08:21.600
    -That didn't go so well.
      -[Madeline] Macbeth!

08:21.602 --> 08:23.034
          -Uh, Archie.
      -[Madeline] Macbeth!

08:23.036 --> 08:24.853
        Won't you, uh...

08:24.854 --> 08:26.671
  go and get her, make her run
 around the theater to undo it.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.162
              Run?

08:28.163 --> 08:29.652
   That's gonna take a while.

08:29.653 --> 08:31.142
    [Henry] Well, carry her
        if you have to.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.177
           All right.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.645
        Wait, undo what?

08:33.647 --> 08:34.779
           The curse.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.582
        Are you serious?

08:37.583 --> 08:40.051
We are performing the Bard's...

08:40.053 --> 08:42.554
            greatest
    and most dangerous play.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.789
        -You mean, Mac--
      -No, no. Just stop.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.808
         You cannot say

08:46.809 --> 08:48.826
 the name of <i> The Scottish Play</i>
         in the theater

08:48.829 --> 08:51.263
       unless it is part
      of the performance.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.899
      [Henry] It unleashes
    the witch's evil magic.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.835
      The name is cursed.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.904
     The play... is cursed.

08:58.906 --> 09:02.274
    [Madeline] Put me down,
      you little shithead!

09:02.276 --> 09:04.643
    Oh, god. Whoever let you
      into the theater...

09:04.645 --> 09:06.878
      And... and everyone
         believes that?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.947
    Oh, everyone knows that.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.583
          Apparently,
  in some ancient production,

09:11.585 --> 09:13.852
       some jealous actor
        killed the star

09:13.854 --> 09:15.921
       with a real knife
      in the murder scene.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.040
        And in doing so,

09:18.041 --> 09:20.158
  was doomed to play the part
       for all eternity.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.695
   And even the greatest role

09:23.697 --> 09:26.598
     created for the stage
         can be tedious

09:26.600 --> 09:28.700
    after a century or two.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.603
     [Madeline] Goddamn it,
       just put me down!

09:31.605 --> 09:33.972
 Put me down, you Neanderthal!

09:33.974 --> 09:36.308
       Just put me down!

09:36.310 --> 09:38.777
        -[Archie grunts]
            -[thuds]

09:38.779 --> 09:40.712
           -[groans]
      -[Archie] It's done.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.213
  [Henry] All the way around?

09:42.215 --> 09:43.665
      She swore, she spit?

09:43.666 --> 09:45.116
       I spit, she swore.
         You heard her.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.736
           Uh, but...

09:47.737 --> 09:50.355
she did not beg to be readmitted
         to the troupe.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.991
 You know the rules, Madeline.
              Beg!

09:52.993 --> 09:55.560
      But I am not sorry.

09:55.561 --> 09:58.128
  You don't have to be sorry,
    but you do have to beg.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.699
            [Elliot]
    Now, my buttery biscuit.

10:00.701 --> 10:04.102
You don't want some unfortunate,
    unforeseen circumstance

10:04.104 --> 10:06.137
   to be on your conscience,
            do you?

10:09.242 --> 10:10.709
            [sighs]

10:10.711 --> 10:13.745
 Oh, please, my liege, my Lord.

10:13.747 --> 10:17.282
Uh, may, I, poor maid that I am,

10:17.284 --> 10:22.153
           know again
  the warmth of your radiance

10:22.155 --> 10:25.757
        and rest beneath
     the towering branches

10:25.759 --> 10:26.958
   of your beautiful cherry--

10:26.960 --> 10:29.094
     Okay, okay, Madeline.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.480
     Very nice. Very nice.

10:31.481 --> 10:32.964
        -Really, was it?
     -[Henry] Yes, it was.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.355
    Now, tell me the truth.

10:34.356 --> 10:35.745
         -Was it good?
 -[Henry] No, it was beautiful.

10:35.746 --> 10:37.135
   -[Henry] It was very nice.
          -Thank you.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.637
     [Henry] Welcome back.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.138
            Henry...

10:41.675 --> 10:43.742
    I'm so happy to be back.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.177
           Thank you.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.246
  So, the kitchen is stocked,

10:48.248 --> 10:50.815
    and the Levesque sisters
       soon will be here.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.751
       They drive the car
       from Montreal, eh?

10:52.753 --> 10:54.853
  Do they know the place well?

10:54.854 --> 10:56.954
         Oh, very well.
  They have come many seasons.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.791
    They can be help for you
         with costumes,

10:59.793 --> 11:01.893
         should that be
       the need you have.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.728
       They were excited
        when I told them

11:03.730 --> 11:05.764
we were to make things go again.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.971
           [cuckoos]

11:18.211 --> 11:20.679
       [foreboding music]

11:28.822 --> 11:30.922
 Sorry I was a dick out there.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.091
           I guess...

11:33.093 --> 11:34.259
        [inhales deeply]

11:34.261 --> 11:36.127
           [chuckles]

11:36.129 --> 11:38.096
...I don't quite know how to be.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.799
           Like I do?

11:47.474 --> 11:49.174
        How's your room?

11:49.176 --> 11:51.176
     [Troy] Uh, it's good.

11:51.812 --> 11:52.944
             Yours?

11:53.313 --> 11:54.813
           It's nice.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.384
         You're, um...

11:59.386 --> 12:01.152
 You're welcome to come visit.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.756
  Uh, we could run lines or...

12:06.259 --> 12:07.859
           I think...

12:08.729 --> 12:11.129
   that might make it harder
        to get to the...

12:11.465 --> 12:14.299
      just friends stage.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.267
            I know.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.037
            I know.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.239
         I just, uh...

12:21.241 --> 12:23.241
         [sighs deeply]

12:24.778 --> 12:26.945
    I just miss you, though.

12:28.815 --> 12:29.981
            Me, too.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.891
        [inhales deeply]

12:48.001 --> 12:49.134
          Tomorrow...

12:52.439 --> 12:54.172
         and tomorrow,

12:56.343 --> 12:58.143
        and tomorrow...

13:01.181 --> 13:03.782
   creeps in this petty pace,

13:05.051 --> 13:06.184
          from day...

13:07.154 --> 13:08.353
            to day,

13:11.124 --> 13:14.159
    until the last syllable
       of recorded time.

13:17.164 --> 13:22.066

       have lighted fools

         [sucks teeth]

13:38.150 --> 13:39.950
       Well, I should be
        playing Macbeth.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.959
            Macbeth.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.263
            Macbeth.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.367
            Macbeth!

13:56.369 --> 13:57.602
            Macbeth!

14:03.543 --> 14:05.844
      You are so naughty.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.112
      [Liz clicks tongue]

14:08.114 --> 14:09.380
      [Thomas] Oh, hello.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.984
          [Liz] I knew
     I would find you here.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.552
   -[Thomas] And so you did.
          -[Liz] Yeah.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.120
         [Thomas] Hmm.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.123
          [smooching]

14:25.932 --> 14:27.749
              God.

14:27.750 --> 14:29.567
     I don't know how many,
     how many more of your

14:29.569 --> 14:33.171
     husband's performances
         I can endure.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.539
         [Liz chuckles]

14:34.541 --> 14:37.175
       Well just imagine
        the performances

14:37.177 --> 14:38.309
     that I have to endure.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.828
      Oh, god. No, thanks.

14:39.829 --> 14:41.346
      -That's horrifying.
         -[Liz laughs]

14:41.348 --> 14:43.147
    Don't worry, sweetheart.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.284
You'll play the Scottish king...

14:46.286 --> 14:47.786
        -[Thomas] Yeah?
        -...soon enough.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.287
         -[Liz] Mm-hm.
     -Do you mean Macbeth?

              Yes.

       be the greatest...

15:08.041 --> 15:09.574
          We gotta go.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.108
 -Before your husband sees us.
             -Okay.

15:11.478 --> 15:12.861
           -Tonight?
             -Yeah.

       [Thomas chuckles]

15:15.892 --> 15:17.536

  that you saw in him, anyway?

15:17.537 --> 15:19.181
         -[Liz laughs]
-[Thomas] Was it the moustache?

 We've been dancing to this...

   Hmm, and your job would be
     refilling the glasses?

16:21.982 --> 16:23.581

18:15.762 --> 18:17.195
   thinking about turning in.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.363
        -How about you?
           -In a bit.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.299
             -Okay.
             -Okay.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.234
       Don't be too long,
    if you know what I mean.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.136
     I know what you mean.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.305
           [chuckles]
         Okay, sweetie.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.439
             Okay.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.477
         [sighs deeply]

18:34.380 --> 18:36.681
       [wings fluttering]

18:49.829 --> 18:51.562
       [thunder crackles]

18:54.334 --> 18:55.700
             Whoa.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.369
   This storm makes me horny.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.141
       Hey, honey. Honey?

19:03.143 --> 19:04.575
      I just had an idea.

19:04.577 --> 19:07.145
 How about we do a little, uh,

19:07.147 --> 19:09.347
      doctor-patient play?

19:09.349 --> 19:11.649
    [Alex] It's been a while
    since your last checkup.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.552
       Okay, great idea.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.689
        [playful music]

19:22.829 --> 19:24.695
 I put your Xanax on the table.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.748
        Already took it.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.566
    That's why we only have
   a short window, my sweet.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.434
         I can't wait.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.987
       [Alex] Me neither!

19:32.988 --> 19:35.172
   [Liz] I'm just taking off
         my face, okay?

19:35.175 --> 19:36.641
    Don't take off too much.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.709
    I like it the way it is.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.479
         Well you know,
     so much of the thrill

19:41.481 --> 19:42.847
    is in the anticipation.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.583
      Yes, maybe for you.
           [chuckles]

19:47.220 --> 19:48.386
              Ah.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.523
        [playful music]

19:54.827 --> 19:57.228
      Dr. Osgood is back!

20:10.610 --> 20:12.210
         [Alex] Honey!

20:13.613 --> 20:15.313
     What's takin' so long?

20:15.882 --> 20:18.216
My appointments are backing up.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.453
            [gasps]

20:22.755 --> 20:25.389

  -[Nigel] Troy, Troy, please.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.631
    Please, please, please.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.301
     Please, can I come in?

20:38.004 --> 20:40.338
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.510
         [door closes]

         [Alex snoring]

20:52.352 --> 20:53.584
        [in soft voice]
           I'm ready.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.553
         [Alex snores]

21:03.997 --> 21:06.497

  -[disembodied voice] Thou...
            -Jesus!

21:17.810 --> 21:21.746

       [thunder rumbles]

21:27.720 --> 21:29.520
          Oh, my god.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.355
           [chuckles]

21:33.860 --> 21:35.593
             Jesus.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.429
     [Thomas sighs deeply]

21:38.431 --> 21:39.964
           It's you.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.465
         [door closes]

21:41.968 --> 21:43.668
  And who were you expecting?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.303
        You, of course.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.438
  It's just, the lightning...

21:47.774 --> 21:49.407
          startled me.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.512
          [smooching]

21:56.015 --> 21:57.615
         [Liz giggles]

21:58.351 --> 21:59.917
     Does this startle you?

22:02.522 --> 22:03.721
         [both chuckle]

22:05.992 --> 22:07.491
         What's wrong?

22:08.728 --> 22:10.594
        -You seem tense.
         -No, I'm not.

22:10.596 --> 22:11.729
        I'm not. I'm...

22:12.332 --> 22:13.864
     Yeah. I am, actually.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.734
             I am.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.602
     Because I don't think
  I can work for that amateur

22:18.604 --> 22:20.204
       for one more day.

22:20.205 --> 22:21.805
     -He's Dr. Osgood, M.D.
              -Mm.

22:21.808 --> 22:26.544
He has saved thousands of lives
    over 17 glorious years.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.945
          Yeah, yeah.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.363
         What a genius.

22:29.364 --> 22:30.780
  You know, being a soap star,

22:31.751 --> 22:33.117
   doesn't make you an actor.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.555
 It does make you rich, though.

22:37.556 --> 22:38.655
 Well, maybe he should've spent
       some of that money

22:38.658 --> 22:39.957
       on drama classes.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.129
              Hmm.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.630
    And what do you suggest
       as an alternative?

22:47.667 --> 22:50.368
       Mmm, an accident?

22:50.803 --> 22:52.002
           [chuckles]

22:52.004 --> 22:53.137
    I love your dirty mind.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.890
            -Yeah?
             -Yeah.

22:55.891 --> 22:58.642
     Well, the stage can be
      a very unpredictable

22:58.644 --> 23:00.444
      and dangerous place.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.380
         -Mm-hmm, yes.
            -Mm-hm?

23:03.950 --> 23:05.549
          Yes, it can.

    <i> of Banquo's last scene?</i>

23:24.971 --> 23:26.704
No, it's okay. I'll start here.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.739
         [Henry] Okay.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.474
  -[Archie] I figure we put...
       -Thou hast it now.

23:30.476 --> 23:31.976
        -[Thomas scoffs]
  -...a show on his entrance.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.678
      [Archie] We could go
       with blue, red...

     King, Cawdor, Glamis,

23:36.916 --> 23:39.167
   -all as the weird women--
            -Henry!

23:39.168 --> 23:41.419
  I'm ready for a run through
      of the dagger scene.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.371
       [Henry] Uh, right.

23:43.372 --> 23:44.955
    Uh, that's a good place
           to start.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.808
            [scoffs]

23:46.809 --> 23:48.092
   Of course, I know my part.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.528
            [scoffs]
             Jeez.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.763
     -[Alex clears throat]
  -Is he going deaf or just...

23:53.032 --> 23:54.432

23:54.434 --> 23:55.866
       He's not playing.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.836
         [Henry] Jason.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.704
             Jason!

24:01.107 --> 24:02.706
             Jason!

24:04.110 --> 24:06.110
         Focus, Jason.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.848
    [Henry] You better know
      your lines, Annabel.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.116
              Yup.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.584
          Oh, Archie.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.051
Uh, we're gonna need you to play
       the second witch.

24:17.190 --> 24:19.957
      Uh, I thought Nigel
        was doing that?

24:19.958 --> 24:22.725
 No, he's having trouble making
his makeup change into Malcolm.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.333
             Okay.

24:29.334 --> 24:30.600
          -[smooching]
        -[Henry] Jason!

24:30.603 --> 24:32.670
    -Mm. Hold that thought.
      -[Annabel chuckles]

24:32.672 --> 24:33.804
          Yeah, sorry.

         [Jason groans]

24:40.213 --> 24:42.146
   [Henry] Jason! Goddamn it!

24:42.148 --> 24:44.048
      Where's the dagger?

24:44.050 --> 24:46.016
       -[Alex vocalizing]
          -Thank you.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.384
      [Alex clears throat]

24:47.385 --> 24:48.751
 [Henry] Little higher, please.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.273
             Good.

24:52.274 --> 24:53.891
     Alex, just stand there
       and reach for it.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.896
      Okay, okay, you're--

24:58.898 --> 25:00.531
 Reach for it, but do not take

25:00.533 --> 25:02.116
  -possession of it. Remember?
              -Oh.

25:02.117 --> 25:03.700
   -Mm-hm, mm-hm. Yeah, yeah.
         -[Henry] Okay?

25:03.703 --> 25:05.035
         It's a vision.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.538
  All right? A haunted dagger.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.608
   Okay? Theatrical illusion.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.877
    [Henry] Don't touch it.
        Don't touch it.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.245
            -Right.
        -[Henry] Right?

25:14.246 --> 25:15.612
     -Theatrical illusion.
 -Okay. Yeah, yeah, of course.

25:15.613 --> 25:16.979
          [chuckling]
         Sorry, sorry.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.115
          It's just...

25:19.685 --> 25:20.818
             Okay.

        -[clears throat]
     -[Alex inhales deeply]

25:26.192 --> 25:28.526
       Is this a dagger,

25:28.528 --> 25:30.861
     which I see before me,

25:30.863 --> 25:33.764
    handle, toward my hand?

25:33.766 --> 25:34.965
        -[Jason groans]
      -[Annabel chuckles]

25:34.967 --> 25:38.102
Come, come, let me clutch thee.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.538
    [Alex] I have thee not,
           and yet--

25:40.540 --> 25:42.172
    I have thee not, and...
            [grunts]

25:42.174 --> 25:43.858
          Hey, Henry.

25:43.859 --> 25:45.543
      -Henry. Sorry, sorry
          -[Henry] Hm?

25:45.545 --> 25:47.111
        [Alex] I just...
           [chuckles]

25:47.112 --> 25:48.678
     [Alex] I have an idea.
        [clears throat]

25:48.681 --> 25:50.948
      Now, I know you said
     I shouldn't touch it,

25:50.950 --> 25:52.583
          but, but...

25:52.818 --> 25:54.084
           how about,

25:54.086 --> 25:56.587
how about we mix it up a little

25:56.589 --> 25:59.023
      and I do, actually,

25:59.025 --> 26:00.324
        grab the knife.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.026
       -[Henry] No, Alex.
             -Huh?

26:02.028 --> 26:03.928
          You don't...

26:03.929 --> 26:05.829
  mix up William Shakespeare,
             Alex.

26:05.831 --> 26:08.966
         You can't grab
       the phantom knife.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.968
          It's just...
            [sighs]

26:10.969 --> 26:12.969
It's so tempting to have a prop
     to work with, ya know?

26:12.972 --> 26:15.039
         [Thomas] Yeah.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.107
   Especially when you've got
 so little talent to work with.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.678
        What did he say?

26:20.680 --> 26:22.212
            I said,
  "Especially when you've got

26:22.214 --> 26:24.949
so little talent to work with."

26:26.752 --> 26:28.953
      Well, how about I...
        [clears throat]

26:30.056 --> 26:31.755
     How about I fire you?

26:31.757 --> 26:33.591
    And then you have no job
         to work with.

26:33.593 --> 26:35.276
     How about them apples?

26:35.277 --> 26:36.960
        Stop! Stop it!
     Cut the crap, you two!

26:37.597 --> 26:39.196
       You understand me?

26:39.198 --> 26:41.031
    -Now, kiss and make up.
             -Huh?

26:43.002 --> 26:44.134
             Fine.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.171
     I use a lot of tongue.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.144
         [light music]

27:08.628 --> 27:09.760
      [Henry] <i> Uh, Thomas?</i>

27:09.762 --> 27:11.061
   You can give them the cue.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.229
        -[Thomas] Yeah?
         -[Henry] Yup.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.932
             Um...

27:14.934 --> 27:16.166
     It will rain tonight.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.334
       Let it come then!

27:17.336 --> 27:20.170
   [all screaming, grunting]

27:20.172 --> 27:22.172
All right, all right, all right!

27:22.174 --> 27:24.775
 All right. Enough. God, stop.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.177
 I thought we were rehearsing.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.413
   Just take it easy. Jesus.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.348
    -It just feels so right.
          -Oh, really?

27:31.350 --> 27:33.350
             -Yeah.
 -You want it to be convincing.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.503
            -Right?
             -Uh...

27:35.504 --> 27:37.655
   Well, a little more butch,
           certainly.

27:37.657 --> 27:40.324
  But, uh, just, why don't you
     save your testosterone

27:40.326 --> 27:42.226
for tomorrow night, okay, guys?

27:42.228 --> 27:44.061
 Let's, uh, let's do it again.

27:44.797 --> 27:45.929
             Hello?

27:46.198 --> 27:48.198
        [girl] Hi, um...

27:48.200 --> 27:51.201
  do you know where I sign up
     for the yoga retreat?

27:56.042 --> 27:57.274
         Oh, we, uh...

27:57.276 --> 27:58.842
      Uh, that's not here.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.277
  [Henry] This is the theater.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.312
    Riverside Resort, right?

28:02.314 --> 28:04.048
   I saw it on Trip Advisor.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.717
        Oh, my goodness.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.919
 [Eloise] That was three years
           gone ago.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.255
     Mr. George, he thought
   it could be a money maker,

28:11.257 --> 28:14.224
        but... nothing.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.727
              -Oh.
        -Are you, um...

28:16.729 --> 28:18.195
         are you hiking
     the Appalachian Trail

28:18.197 --> 28:19.964
         or something?

28:19.965 --> 28:21.732
     Yeah, and I scheduled
         my entire hike

28:21.734 --> 28:23.734
    around this retreat, so.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.437
            Oh, god.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.238
    [Edna] Oh, my goodness.
           [chuckles]

28:28.240 --> 28:29.840
  Who is this I am seeing now?

28:29.842 --> 28:31.475
         Edna, she came
     for the yoga retreat.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.310
         [both chuckle]

28:33.312 --> 28:35.112
      [Edna] Eloise and I
         cannot even do

28:35.114 --> 28:36.480
the downward canine, I'm afraid.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.248
        [both laughing]

28:38.250 --> 28:39.983
        Oh, young lady,

28:39.985 --> 28:41.251
       what is your name?

28:41.253 --> 28:43.320
            -Juliet.
          -Oh, Juliet.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.189
        Beautiful name.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.857
         -It's French.
              -Mm.

28:46.859 --> 28:49.193
          Oh, you stay
    for refreshment, Juliet?

28:49.195 --> 28:51.261
  Uh, no, no, I'm really fine.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.397
             Yeah.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.332
  Why not? Stay, stay with us.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.167
    I don't want to impose.

28:57.169 --> 28:58.802
    It's not an imposition.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.270
            Really.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.106
           [chuckles]

29:03.509 --> 29:06.009
      [suspenseful music]

29:10.416 --> 29:12.983
        [water sloshing]

29:29.001 --> 29:30.367
          Oh, at last!

29:30.369 --> 29:31.535
           Nap time!

29:31.537 --> 29:33.237
          Die, Duncan!

29:33.239 --> 29:35.272
          [both grunt]

29:37.943 --> 29:39.843
            [thuds]

29:40.479 --> 29:42.346
    [approaching footsteps]

29:45.317 --> 29:46.884
           Fainting.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.520
            [thuds]

29:49.522 --> 29:52.489
     Oh, Elliot. Must you?

29:52.491 --> 29:54.191
  [Madeline and Elliot laugh]

29:55.528 --> 29:57.561
 [Elliot] Haven't lost my touch
        have I, darling?

29:57.563 --> 29:59.062
          Impressive.

29:59.064 --> 30:02.015
     A method taught to me

30:02.016 --> 30:04.967
   by Sir Lawrence Olivier's
     stunt double himself.

30:05.838 --> 30:07.204
    What happened to Nigel?

30:07.206 --> 30:08.806
            [sighs]
      The sight of blood.

30:08.808 --> 30:11.175
      Does it every time.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.543
    But it's not real blood.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.462
      [Madeline] Oh, well!

30:14.463 --> 30:16.380
     Then it must have been
    your performance, dear.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.949
    [Elliot] Oh. Thank you.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.018
Only one small problem, really.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.085
           What's up?

30:22.087 --> 30:23.287
        I cannot get up.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.139
            [scoffs]

30:25.140 --> 30:26.356
    Don't worry, I got you.

30:27.293 --> 30:30.294
       [clearing throat]

30:30.296 --> 30:32.296
       Uh, crown, please.
        [clears throat]

30:37.503 --> 30:39.036
           Thank you.

30:39.872 --> 30:41.839
            [sighs]

30:41.841 --> 30:44.107
   [Henry] Let's have a look
     at our king then, huh?

30:46.979 --> 30:48.312
             Alex.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.513
         It's amazing!

30:49.515 --> 30:51.315
 It doesn't make me look, uh...

30:52.017 --> 30:54.918
 No, you look absolutely regal.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.220
             -I do?
     -[Henry clicks tongue]

30:56.222 --> 30:57.855
              Huh.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.389
        [clears throat]
     I guess I do, don't I?

30:59.391 --> 31:00.591
            Well...
            [scoffs]

31:00.593 --> 31:02.226
       [clearing throat]

31:02.228 --> 31:05.195
         Uh, your king
     is eternally grateful.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.363
          -[both] Oh.
             -As...

31:07.366 --> 31:08.932
          we all are.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.634
    We love the show people.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.469
          [all laugh]

31:12.470 --> 31:14.303
       [Edna and Eloise]
     Beautiful, beautiful.

31:15.174 --> 31:16.807
          Yes, right?

31:16.808 --> 31:18.441
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, pull it out.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.344
     Till Birnam Wood comes
         to Dunsinane.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.680
         -No! Save it!
             -Huh?

31:22.681 --> 31:25.015
Okay, it's time for the witches
   to meet the Scottish King.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.950
    Archie, why don't you go
         get your wig?

31:26.952 --> 31:28.452
       -[Archie] Got it.
        -[Thomas] What?

31:28.454 --> 31:30.204
           -Hang on.
        -[Archie] Mm-hm.

31:30.205 --> 31:31.955
 Sorry. I thought this was just
    a straight run through?

31:31.957 --> 31:34.458
We've got our first performance
        tomorrow night.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.260
       No, we have to run
      Archie's lines, so.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.296
  I just wanted to say thanks
      before heading out.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.068
         [Alex] Henry.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.571
             -Hmm.
      -Why don't we, uh...

31:47.573 --> 31:49.306
      ask this young lady
         if she'd like

31:49.308 --> 31:50.507
   to play the second which?

31:51.577 --> 31:53.577
      I have this covered.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.914
    Me? I, I, I really need
         to get going.

31:56.916 --> 31:59.483
     No. No, actually, I--

31:59.485 --> 32:00.985
    I think that could work.

32:00.986 --> 32:02.486
     Honestly, it probably
        would be better

32:02.487 --> 32:03.987
    to have a woman with us,
        at the cauldron.

32:03.989 --> 32:05.289
      No offense, Archie.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.190
          None taken.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.327
  Have you ever acted before?

32:11.263 --> 32:12.562
    A little in high school.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.348
        Well you'll fit
      right in here, then.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.133
     Performing Shakespeare
       can be thrilling.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.335
      You know, we did do
  some Shakespeare, actually.

32:18.337 --> 32:21.438
    Ans there is, of course,
       a modest stipend.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.573
   Most modest, I assure you.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.075
           [chuckles]

32:25.210 --> 32:27.244
            [sighs]

32:27.245 --> 32:29.279
     Well, it would be nice
to sleep in a bed for a change.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.764
         [Juliet sighs]

32:30.765 --> 32:32.248
     I just-- I don't want
       to embarrass you.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.684
           Oh, dear,

32:33.686 --> 32:36.653
    we are able to embarrass
    ourselves quite capably

32:36.655 --> 32:38.221
    without additional help.

32:38.223 --> 32:40.357
          -[chuckles]
    -[Madeline] Oh, Elliot.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.495
        [ominous music]

32:46.365 --> 32:48.031
            This...

32:48.033 --> 32:50.100
     -is our dressing room.
       -[Juliet chuckles]

32:50.102 --> 32:51.601
           And here,

32:51.603 --> 32:52.669
      here is our makeup.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.037
        [Juliet] Mm-hmm.

32:54.039 --> 32:55.505
     So much fun, isn't it?

32:55.507 --> 32:57.607
          [all laugh]

32:57.609 --> 33:00.177
      [Madeline] Here are
         our costumes.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.611
       -[Juliet] Oh, wow.
        -[Annabel] Ooh.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.313
     And here, my darling,

33:03.315 --> 33:05.449
         is your robe!

33:05.451 --> 33:07.751
         -[Juliet] Wow.
           -Oh, yes.

33:07.752 --> 33:10.052
      They really help us
  get into character, you see.

33:10.055 --> 33:12.356
             -Wow.
      -Even in rehearsals.

33:12.358 --> 33:13.941
       It looks amazing.

33:13.942 --> 33:15.525
It's just like playing dress up
  when we were little, right?

33:15.527 --> 33:17.694
         [all chuckle]

33:17.696 --> 33:20.430
     [Madeline] And to get
        to stage right,

33:20.432 --> 33:21.765
        we go this way.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.634
    Be careful, my darling,
        watch your step.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.604
    Oh, here are our props.

33:27.606 --> 33:30.557
           Follow me.

33:30.558 --> 33:33.509
 The flooring is a bit uneven.
           [chuckles]

33:33.512 --> 33:36.179
        Watch your step,
        watch your step.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.017
    [electricity crackling]

33:40.019 --> 33:41.718
    [Madeline] Oh. Oh, yes.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.454
    Old theater, old wiring.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.622
     You'll get used to it.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.190
           I'm sure.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.227
     [Annabel] So, Juliet,
     we go under the stage,

33:50.228 --> 33:51.694
       and then we pop up
       on the other side.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.497
           [chuckles]
    [Annabel] It's so cool.

33:54.099 --> 33:55.232
            Juliet.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.174
       [foreboding music]

34:08.781 --> 34:11.181
        [Thomas moaning]

34:23.395 --> 34:25.462
       It was brilliant.

34:25.464 --> 34:28.065
<i>[Alex]And all our yesterdays...</i>

34:28.067 --> 34:32.335
       have lighted fools
    the way to dusty death.

34:33.472 --> 34:36.139
    Out, out, brief candle!

34:36.141 --> 34:37.440
     [electricity crackles]

34:39.210 --> 34:40.377
          Very funny.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.313
    Turn the lights back on.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.315
             Jason?

34:46.318 --> 34:51.088
  Turn the lights on, please.
      I'm rehearsing here.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.261
      [disembodied voice]

35:00.466 --> 35:01.598
            Thomas?

35:02.768 --> 35:04.301
          Is that you?

35:08.707 --> 35:10.207
            Jason?

35:10.843 --> 35:13.343
       [foreboding music]

35:15.714 --> 35:16.813
             Hello?

35:16.815 --> 35:18.782
     [disembodied laughter]

35:18.784 --> 35:20.383
         Anybody there?

35:23.522 --> 35:26.123
      [suspenseful music]

35:28.393 --> 35:29.893
       -[Alex screaming]
           -[clanks]

35:31.630 --> 35:33.130
             Help!

35:33.132 --> 35:36.133
         Alex is hurt,
  I don't know what happened!

35:36.135 --> 35:37.667
         -Hurt? What?
             -What?

35:39.438 --> 35:41.671
       -[Henry] Oh, no.
    -[Archie] Nobody panic.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.241
         Nobody panic.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.713
      [indistinct chatter]

35:50.616 --> 35:51.848
         -[Henry] Alex.
         -[women gasp]

35:51.850 --> 35:53.150
             -Alex.
           -[tapping]

35:53.152 --> 35:55.285
       Hey, wake up, man!

35:56.622 --> 35:58.488
             -Alex.
          -[Liz] Alex?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.324
             -Alex.
          -[Alex] Mm?

36:00.325 --> 36:02.159
       -Can you hear me?
           -Liz Beth.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.693
         -Is that you?
          -[Liz] Yes.

36:03.695 --> 36:06.296
  I, I, can hear you, but I...

36:06.698 --> 36:08.198
        I can't see you.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.766
      [Liz] What happened?

36:09.768 --> 36:11.568
    [Alex] I, I don't know.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.520
   I heard something, and...

36:13.521 --> 36:15.471
-And then everything went black.
       -[Madeline gasps]

36:15.474 --> 36:16.540
           The curse!

36:16.542 --> 36:17.707
            Oh, god.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.342
          What curse?

36:19.645 --> 36:20.944
        [Alex] I'm fine.

36:20.946 --> 36:23.180
  Uh, let me... let me sit up.
            [grunts]

36:23.182 --> 36:25.849
     Let me sit up, and...
    and gather my thoughts.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.751
      Well, that should be
        quite a harvest.

36:27.753 --> 36:29.286
         -[Henry] Alex.
              -Hm?

36:29.288 --> 36:30.604
        [Henry] You sure
       you're all right?

36:30.605 --> 36:31.921
      [blows raspberries]
[Alex] Of course, I'm all right.

36:31.922 --> 36:33.238
   I'm better than all right.

36:33.239 --> 36:34.555
       -Here, help me up.
       -[Madeline gasps]

36:34.560 --> 36:36.726
           [grunting]

36:36.728 --> 36:39.529
            [sighs]
 After a near-death experience,

36:39.531 --> 36:41.198
     one sees one's purpose

36:41.200 --> 36:43.200
in a new and crystalline light.

36:43.202 --> 36:46.303
       I am ready to give
   the Scottish King my all.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.371
[inhales deeply, clears throat]

36:48.907 --> 36:51.474
        Tomorrow, and...

36:51.476 --> 36:52.642
             Uh...
            [sighs]

36:53.478 --> 36:54.611
             Line?

36:55.547 --> 36:57.214
        -Uh, "Tomorrow."
              -Ah!

36:57.216 --> 36:58.915
       Yes, that's right.
           [chuckles]

36:58.917 --> 37:02.285
    Tomorrow, and tomorrow,

37:02.621 --> 37:04.754
           and, uh...

37:04.756 --> 37:07.290
           -Uh, line?
       -[all] "Tomorrow."

37:07.292 --> 37:08.959
           [chuckles]
            Oh, yes.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.627
      How could I forget.
           [chuckles]

37:11.630 --> 37:13.363
             Uh...

37:13.365 --> 37:15.165
            [sighs]

37:15.166 --> 37:16.966
     Oh, it's right there.

37:16.969 --> 37:19.836
     Just over the rainbow,
          my darling.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.572
      Oh, dear! Oh, dear.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.341
    I'm still a little high,
         but I'm fine.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.842
   -I'm all right. I'm fine.
    -[Madeline] I say bravo!

37:25.844 --> 37:27.319
       -[Elliot] Courage!
         -I say bravo!

37:27.320 --> 37:28.795
       -[Elliot] Courage!
       -[Alex] I'm okay.

37:28.796 --> 37:30.271
        -[all clapping]
        -[Elliot] Bravo!

37:30.272 --> 37:31.747
 [Alex] Okay. Yes, done. Okay.

37:37.489 --> 37:38.622
       All right, Thomas.

37:38.624 --> 37:42.692
  Looks like you're gonna have
   to play The Scottish King,

37:42.694 --> 37:44.361
      and I'll do Banquo.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.497
     As you wish, my Lord.

37:49.501 --> 37:50.700
         Cut the crap.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.838
    You know, I do not know
     how Alex got whacked,

37:54.840 --> 37:56.339
          but he did.

37:56.842 --> 37:58.708
And now, you're our only choice.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.645
           I'm ready.

38:01.647 --> 38:02.846
     You know, you might be
         a good actor,

38:02.848 --> 38:04.648
but you're a consummate asshole.

38:05.317 --> 38:07.651
The only good thing about this,

38:07.652 --> 38:09.986
     is that we get to cut
your head off in the last scene.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.655
Thanks for your support, Henry.

38:22.901 --> 38:25.402
        [ominous music]

38:29.574 --> 38:31.708
        [water sloshing]

38:39.618 --> 38:41.351
            [gasps]

38:44.323 --> 38:46.623
      [suspenseful music]

38:51.630 --> 38:53.763
           [gasping]

38:57.336 --> 39:00.003
 Where is the Thane of Cawdor?

39:00.005 --> 39:01.971
  We coursed him at the heels,

39:01.973 --> 39:04.374
       but he rides well.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.577
 See, see our honored hostess.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.647
         [Liz shrieks]

39:11.817 --> 39:13.383
              Out!

39:14.086 --> 39:15.719
           Damn spot.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.987
           [panting]

39:17.989 --> 39:19.823
        Uh, wrong scene?

39:20.492 --> 39:21.624
        That's Act Five.

39:21.626 --> 39:22.759
           Act Five.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.900
       [foreboding music]

39:31.903 --> 39:33.370
       [Liz sighs deeply]

39:33.372 --> 39:35.038
       Look at my hands.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.773
     They're lovely hands.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.507
     Yeah. They don't show
        your age at all.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.912
   I just need a little help
     washing the blood off.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.499
             Sorry.
           [chuckles]

39:45.500 --> 39:47.517
     Guess it's happy hour
         already, huh?

39:47.519 --> 39:49.652
   -Come here. Are you okay?
             -Yeah.

39:50.522 --> 39:51.788
            [groans]

39:54.025 --> 39:56.126
  I'm, I'm realizing, that...

39:56.128 --> 39:59.496
how upsetting it must have been
     to see Alex get hurt.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.248
           [panting]

40:02.249 --> 40:04.666
  Henry, I need you to help me
wash this blood off of my hands.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.172
        You know I love
    the method acting, Liz.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.408
     But there is no blood,
     in reality, there's...

40:11.410 --> 40:12.909
       -there's no blood.
         -[Liz panting]

40:15.080 --> 40:17.414
      [breathing heavily]

40:19.885 --> 40:22.018
              -No?
              -No.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.421
         No, no blood.

40:24.823 --> 40:25.922
          -But, no...
              -No!

40:25.924 --> 40:28.191
  But very, very, convincing.

40:28.193 --> 40:30.994
        I mean, that...
  that's some real conviction.

40:31.630 --> 40:32.762
            Like...

40:32.764 --> 40:34.564
     Crazy ass conviction.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.933
    [Henry and Liz laughing]

40:36.935 --> 40:37.988
     [Henry] Oh, that's...

40:37.989 --> 40:39.042
  [Liz] Uh, there is no blood.
        I see that now.

40:39.043 --> 40:40.096
       There's no blood.
       There's no blood.

40:40.097 --> 40:41.150
       -All right. Okay.
             -Okay?

40:41.151 --> 40:42.204
            -Okay.
          -No, no, no.

40:42.207 --> 40:43.818
     Let's give us a start
         from the top.

40:43.819 --> 40:45.430
   -Let's go back to the top.
             -Okay.

40:45.431 --> 40:47.042
        -Come on, dear.
          -[Liz] Okay.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.711
             -Okay.
             -Okay.

40:48.713 --> 40:50.647
     -No, no, no. Come on.
           -[Liz] Oh.

40:50.649 --> 40:51.848
          Fresh start.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.918
           Very good.

40:54.920 --> 40:55.985
          -[Liz] Whoo!
       -[Alex] All right?

40:55.987 --> 40:57.587
         [Liz laughing]

40:57.588 --> 40:59.188
 -[Nigel] You're like so in it.
         -[Liz laughs]

40:59.191 --> 41:00.990
        -[Troy] Got me.
         -[Nigel] Wow.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.091
 I thought I saw it, you know?

41:02.093 --> 41:03.626
          [Liz] Okay.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.497
      [suspenseful music]

41:14.873 --> 41:16.539
        [in soft voice]
I think maybe it's time to start

41:16.541 --> 41:18.975
       thinking about you
     playing Lady Macbeth.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.681
             -Okay.
  -From the "Thane of Cawdor."

41:28.520 --> 41:30.820
       [foreboding music]

41:32.824 --> 41:34.023
             So...

41:36.862 --> 41:39.596
    seems I will be Macbeth.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.265
           Oh, yeah.

41:42.267 --> 41:44.100
  Yeah, it does seem that way,
          doesn't it?

41:45.704 --> 41:47.637
     You know, I dreamed it
          last night.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.774
   It's probably a prophecy.

41:51.776 --> 41:54.911
      It's not a prophecy
 if you make it happen, Thomas.

41:55.847 --> 41:56.980
           Seriously?

41:56.982 --> 42:01.918
  [Thomas] I... I had nothing
        to do with that.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.921
You don't think I'd actually try
         and kill him?

42:04.923 --> 42:08.091
       Well, you did say
that there would be an accident.

42:08.093 --> 42:09.259
       [Liz] You know how
         the play goes.

42:09.261 --> 42:10.927
      We murder the king.

42:13.064 --> 42:15.048
          Okay, well.

42:15.049 --> 42:17.033
 Alex is on permanent bed rest
           now, so...

42:18.003 --> 42:19.802
   all's well that ends well.

42:19.804 --> 42:21.704
       Oh, maybe for you.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.007
         -[Thomas] Hm?
           -You know.

42:25.176 --> 42:26.809
         Maybe for you.

42:27.178 --> 42:28.745
     Why don't you man up?

42:29.281 --> 42:30.647
             -Huh?
              -Hm?

42:30.649 --> 42:32.081
     Why don't you man up?

42:33.218 --> 42:34.551
       [Thomas chuckles]

42:34.553 --> 42:36.019
   Come to my woman's breast.

42:36.021 --> 42:38.288
        Yeah, all right.
        Okay, okay, Liz.

42:38.290 --> 42:40.223
   You're scaring, scaring--
       you're scaring me.

42:40.225 --> 42:43.026
          Enough with
  the Lady Macbeth shit, okay?

42:44.062 --> 42:45.929
   Maybe everything ends well
            for you,

42:45.931 --> 42:48.731
but it doesn't end well for me,
         it never does.

42:56.007 --> 42:58.141
        [ominous music]

43:02.247 --> 43:04.113
       [Alex] <i> Is this...</i>

43:04.115 --> 43:07.083
a dagger which I see before me?

43:08.119 --> 43:10.153
   The handle toward my hand?

43:12.958 --> 43:14.123
            Come...

43:14.893 --> 43:16.726
      let me clutch thee.

43:18.196 --> 43:19.862
    I have thee not, and...

43:20.332 --> 43:22.198
      yet I see thee still.

43:24.636 --> 43:26.869
  Art thou not, fatal vision,

43:28.206 --> 43:30.707
sensible to feeling as to sight?

43:32.644 --> 43:35.178
          Or art thou
   but a dagger of the mind?

43:36.881 --> 43:38.181
       A false creation,

43:39.818 --> 43:41.751
         proceeding...

43:41.753 --> 43:43.953
 from the heat-oppressed brain.

43:48.893 --> 43:50.893
           [clapping]

43:52.163 --> 43:54.297
        [Elliot] Bravo!

43:54.299 --> 43:56.966
      -Bravo! Spectacular!
        -[all clapping]

43:58.169 --> 43:59.936
        [Elliot] Bravo!

43:59.938 --> 44:02.271
          You know, I,
   I kinda felt that, Henry.

44:02.273 --> 44:04.140
       -We all did, Alex.
              -Oh.

44:04.409 --> 44:07.210
        Oh, well done...

44:07.212 --> 44:08.978
            my King!

44:08.980 --> 44:10.113
         What happened?

44:10.915 --> 44:12.081
       Alex is recovered.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.097
  I'm just not feeling myself,

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:12.100
        actually, so...

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:15.236
        That's strange.
       That's usually...

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:16.738
        the only person
     you have feelings for.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.673
         -[both laugh]
        -[Henry] Right?

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:20.508
      Yeah, I didn't sleep
       last night, so...

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.494
       Well, no one did.

01:06:22.495 --> 01:06:24.479
         But the show,
    it's gotta go on, okay?

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:28.049
    Unless you're too unwell
          to perform.

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:33.421
              No.

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:39.461
          No, no. I...

01:06:42.366 --> 01:06:45.233
  You haven't noticed anything
  unusual recently, have you?

01:06:46.536 --> 01:06:49.104
      Uh, just that, um...

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:53.441
     just that everybody's
    really upped their game.

01:06:53.443 --> 01:06:54.576
             Yeah.

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:57.078
             Yeah.

01:06:58.015 --> 01:06:59.547
      And you don't think
        that's strange?

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:03.184
        Just the result
     of all our hard work.

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:08.490
        [clicks tongue]
             Okay.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.127
         [Henry] Okay.

01:07:12.596 --> 01:07:14.162
        [Thomas scoffs]

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:16.164
      And one last thing,
        you don't, um...

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:21.269
       you don't believe
  in the haunted play idea...

01:07:22.172 --> 01:07:23.438
            do you?

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:24.705
            Really?
   Did you just ask me that?

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.574
    -[Thomas] It's nothing.
        -For god's sake.

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:28.043
          It's just...

01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:31.713
          Oh, my god.

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:33.681
     -So we're good, right?
             -Yeah.

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:35.350
         -[Henry] Yeah?
       -Yeah, we're good.

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:38.620
             Okay.

           [sniffles]

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.469
           Holy shit.

01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:58.139
            Stars...

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:01.342
        hide your fires.

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:07.515
      [Thomas as Macbeth]
        Let no light see

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:11.119
  thy black and deep desires.

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:16.591
      We shall be Macbeth.

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.160
             Yeah.

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:23.564
 See, I'm not, I'm not so sure.

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:29.604
     Do not disappoint us.

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:34.309
      Get thee, now hence.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.278
  And let sun ne'er rise again
    without ambitions fated,

01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:41.216
        treasure tight,
       within thy grasp.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:45.420
             Uh...

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:50.591

01:09:58.228 --> 01:09:58.927
              Yup?

          [door opens]

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:06.201
         Can I come in?

01:10:06.603 --> 01:10:07.869
        Yeah, of course.

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:10.238
          Oh, Thomas.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.307
          Sweetheart.

01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:17.478
 I was a little abrupt earlier.

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:21.649
       I know I have been
       an absolute mess.

01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:22.750
           [chuckles]

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:24.485
      And too hard on you.

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:30.291
  And I really don't want you
   to carry any bad feelings

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:32.427
  out onto the stage tonight,
             okay?

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:35.496

             Whoo!

01:10:44.874 --> 01:10:47.275
  -Feels good to get that out.
              -Mm.

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:25.613
    Oh, Thomas, sweetheart.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:29.584
    That was a little abrupt
            earlier.

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:33.688
        I know I've been
       an absolute mess.

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:35.890
      And too hard on you.

01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:40.095
            [sighs]

01:11:40.096 --> 01:11:42.430

          What? What?

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:24.505
        Something else?

01:12:26.643 --> 01:12:28.476
            [gasps]
        Something else?

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.347
      You were just here.

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:35.483
          [Liz] I was?

01:12:36.886 --> 01:12:39.420
         Yes. You were.

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:42.040

 Just now. Literally just now.

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:44.726
           Just now.

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.396
            [Thomas]
   What the hell is going on?

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:50.598
    What have we done, Liz?

01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:52.700
              Liz?

01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:01.509
        Something wicked
    this way comes, my King.

       Something wicked.

        [ominous music]

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:17.492
             Yeah.

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:21.596

          Yes, Henry.

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:40.047
  Are these rolling set pieces
          gonna work?

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:41.549
        And did you set
     the final light cues?

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.050
 Did you check the taped marks,
    go over the prop table--

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:45.069
    [Archie] Yes, yes, yes.

01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:47.087
And yes to the next three things
      you're gonna ask me.

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:49.557
  Henry, we've done this play
           50 times.

        Henry, my love.
       What do you think?

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:57.098
      Did you use a mirror

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.100
    or just your intuition,
           Madeline?

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.902
  I thought it was very scary.

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:02.582

01:14:02.583 --> 01:14:04.261
          Well, yeah,
     and maybe too much so.

01:14:04.262 --> 01:14:05.940
     We might have children
     in the audience. We...

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.108
     We have to be careful.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:09.110

    and am reporting to you
        from Mr. George,

     no more seats to sell.

           [chuckles]
        Is that unusual?

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:40.007
     Oh, it never happens.

01:14:40.009 --> 01:14:42.827
          So exciting.

01:14:42.828 --> 01:14:45.646
  The feel of a packed theater
    is absolutely thrilling.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:47.131

 [Annabel] When shall we three
          meet again?

01:15:12.509 --> 01:15:15.176
     In thunder, lightning,
          or in rain?

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.278
  When the hurly-burly's done,

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.213
when the battle's lost and won.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:22.750
That will be ere the set of sun.

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:25.586
       -Where the place?
        -Upon the heath.

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:36.063
   Two scenes, and I'm dead.

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:38.866
   All right. Ready, Cue 11.

01:15:39.302 --> 01:15:41.869
          Cue 11, go.

01:15:42.605 --> 01:15:45.006
            [Elliot]
    What bloody man is that?

01:15:45.008 --> 01:15:47.142
   He can report, as seemeth

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:49.277
  by his plight of the revolt,
       the newest state.

01:15:49.279 --> 01:15:50.645
          [male actor]
     This is the Sergeant,

01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:51.846
 who like a good and hearty...

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:57.485
       Where's Liz Beth?

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:57.851
       -[Archie shushes]
     -Tell me she's sober.

01:15:57.852 --> 01:15:58.217
     She's a professional,
          don't worry.

01:15:58.218 --> 01:15:58.583
      Yeah, and she's also
         an alcoholic.

01:15:58.584 --> 01:15:58.949
     And she's on in five.

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:00.922
        -Where's Thomas?
        -Ready, Cue 12.

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:02.156
            Cue 12.

01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:05.192
          [Archie] Go.

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:07.094
         [male actor]
   The merciless Macdonwalds.

01:16:07.096 --> 01:16:09.864
     Worthy to be a rebel,
          for to that,

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:11.933
   the multiplying villainies
           of nature

01:16:11.935 --> 01:16:15.703
       do swarm upon him
    from the western isles,

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:17.939
  of kerns and gallowglasses.

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:23.110
    They made themselves air
   into which they vanished.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:27.848
      Whilst I stood rapt
      in the wonder of it,

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:31.118
  came missives from the King,
      who all hailed me...

01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:33.955
        Thane of Cawdor.

01:16:33.957 --> 01:16:36.958
     By which title before
these weird sisters saluted me,

01:16:37.994 --> 01:16:40.828
and referred me to the coming on
       of time, with...

01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:44.098
  "Hail, king that shalt be."

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:50.171
  "Hail, king that shalt be!"

01:16:51.174 --> 01:16:53.007
           Is this...

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:55.109
 a dagger which I see before me?

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.613
   The handle toward my hand?

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:01.882
             Come.

01:17:01.884 --> 01:17:03.217
      Let me clutch thee.

01:17:06.356 --> 01:17:08.322
        I have thee not,

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:10.157
   and yet I see thee still.

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:14.161
     [Alex] Art thou not...

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:16.163
         Banquet scene
     is coming up, Elliot.

01:17:16.165 --> 01:17:17.765
   Yes, of course. I'm ready.

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:19.366
   Well, these quick changes
       are gonna kill me.

01:17:19.369 --> 01:17:21.369
 Yeah, what this company needs

01:17:21.371 --> 01:17:23.188
     -is a few more actors.
          -You know...

01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:25.006
 -Uh, where the hell are they?
          -[chuckles]

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:26.624
              Hey.

01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:28.241
 Try a couple of deep breaths,
           my friend.

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:30.645
   You have managed to awaken

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:33.648
         an elderly man
  from a very pleasant sleep.

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:36.851
 Is there no bottom to the pit
     that is your cruelty?

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:38.986
       -[Nigel chuckles]
        -You're welcome.

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:42.323
    [both breathing heavily]

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:44.191
   [Nigel] This looks right.

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:47.194
            -Ready?
             -Yeah.

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:48.729
          [both growl]

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:50.487
     <i> ¶ Let's kill Thomas ¶</i>

01:17:50.488 --> 01:17:52.244
            <i> -¶ Ey! ¶</i>
 <i> -¶ Let's, let's kill Thomas ¶</i>

01:17:52.245 --> 01:17:54.001
   <i> -¶ Let's kill Thomas now ¶</i>
           <i> -¶ What ¶</i>

01:17:59.075 --> 01:17:59.415

01:17:59.416 --> 01:17:59.756
      <i> ¶ Uh, let's, let's ¶</i>

01:17:59.757 --> 01:18:00.097
     -All right. Let's go.
             -Okay.

01:18:00.098 --> 01:18:00.438
         [Nigel] Uh-uh!

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:01.776
             -Troy?
             -Shit.

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:03.778
 What the hell are you wearing?

01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:05.746
  That's what I was just about
          to ask you.

01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:08.916
  -Whoa, whoa, what the fu...
      -No time, no time!

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:10.117
          [Troy] Hey--

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:13.020

  Uh, where the hell are they?

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.542
         I don't know!

01:18:17.543 --> 01:18:19.060
            [Nigel]
This is getting freaking weird.

01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:20.728
      We're late already.

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:23.965
        [knock on door]

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:25.466

   Henry is looking for you.

           -No shit!
           -No shit!

01:18:30.139 --> 01:18:31.689
          Okay, um...

01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:33.240
       It doesn't matter.
     Just put something on.

     -[hangers clattering]
        -[Nigel groans]

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.986
    You got it on backwards.

01:18:44.987 --> 01:18:46.253
 Raise that hanger right there.

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:48.122
      [Nigel] Okay, okay.

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:53.961

     It will rain tonight.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.906

Ourself will mingle with society
   and play the humble host.

  Which of you have done this?

01:20:48.244 --> 01:20:49.910
   [all] What, my good Lord?

01:20:49.912 --> 01:20:51.412
 Thou can'st not say I did it.

01:20:51.414 --> 01:20:53.447
          Never shake
     thy gory locks at me!

01:20:53.449 --> 01:20:55.549
        Gentlemen, rise.
   His Highness is not well.

01:20:55.551 --> 01:20:57.985

      Remember how you lit
    Banquo's ghost tonight.

         It's perfect.

01:21:05.127 --> 01:21:07.328
     -[Liz] Are you a man?
          -[Alex] Aye.

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:09.163
        And a bold one,

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:10.997
     that dare look at that
 which might appall the Devil!

01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:17.071
 Double, double time. Let's go!

01:21:17.073 --> 01:21:18.973

   No, I... I look horrific.

01:21:21.143 --> 01:21:22.610
          No, come on.
We're supposed to look horrific.

01:21:22.612 --> 01:21:24.529
      -Let's go. Come on.
     -[Madeline] Oh, jeez.

01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:26.447
         I'm not ready.
      I'm just not ready.

          I'm coming.

01:21:32.154 --> 01:21:33.888
      [Madeline] Oh, well,
          should we...

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.623
 -[Annabel] Let's go, let's go.

      What are you doing?

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:42.919
     [Madeline] What, wait,
       where did she go?

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.242
    [Annabel] Will you stop
        fooling around?

01:21:44.243 --> 01:21:45.565
       Madeline, come on.
       We need to hurry.

01:21:49.972 --> 01:21:51.683
         Off the wall,
   we're gonna miss our cue.

      We're almost there.
      We're almost there.

01:21:59.181 --> 01:22:01.515
    [Annabel] That's weird.
  We're back where we started.

01:22:01.517 --> 01:22:03.217
   We have to go. No, no, no.
         We have to go.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.918
      We're gonna miss it,
  we're gonna miss our scene.

01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:07.488
 [witches] Double, double toil
          and trouble,

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:10.591
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

  Eye of newt and toe of frog,

01:22:14.463 --> 01:22:16.697
 Wool of bat and tongue of dog.

     Something's not right.

     you should calm down.

             Henry.

01:23:22.481 --> 01:23:24.398
   What the hell is going on?
     We didn't kill Banquo.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.266
  What are you talking about?
       It was brilliant.

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:28.002
            I mean,
  it was very realistic, guys.

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:30.337
No, listen. We missed our scene.

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:32.206
     We didn't kill Banquo.

01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:34.208
     Then who the hell did?

01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:35.342
        And where is he?

01:23:36.379 --> 01:23:38.779

       [grandiose music]

01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:17.237
      Henry, we have a bit
      of a situation here.

01:26:17.239 --> 01:26:19.339
       You're telling me?
         Where is Alex?

01:26:19.942 --> 01:26:21.408
  Oh, thank god, there he is.

01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:22.826
        [Archie] Henry.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.420
         and tomorrow.

01:26:34.557 --> 01:26:36.223
         And tomorrow.

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:38.759
        What's going on?

01:26:38.761 --> 01:26:41.295
He was really stabbed. For real.

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:43.730
        Thomas is dead.

01:26:45.434 --> 01:26:46.633
        Not completely.

01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:51.505

       have lighted fools

          -Who's dead?
            -Thomas.

01:27:05.487 --> 01:27:06.954
        And why the hell
     is he playing my part?

01:27:06.956 --> 01:27:09.323
      Excellent question.

01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:11.691
        I'm telling you,
  he is in his dressing room,

     [Madeline] Quiet, son.
     You're frightening me.

01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:18.398
 It is a tale told by an idiot,

01:27:57.789 --> 01:27:59.005
Is it time for the curtain call?

01:27:59.008 --> 01:28:00.474
       Not quite, Elliot.

  What are you talking about?
   We haven't done anything.

01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:16.556
    I'm afraid someone did.

01:28:16.558 --> 01:28:19.693
 Well, then someone better undo
           this shit.

01:28:20.729 --> 01:28:21.962
       I don't know how.

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:23.563

 the equivocation of the fiend
