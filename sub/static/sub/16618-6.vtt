00:00.835 --> 00:03.069
ANNOUNCER:
<i>You're watching</i> The Simpsons.

00:03.070 --> 00:05.304
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.772
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sundays,</i>

00:06.774 --> 00:09.174
<i>and check out our other Fox</i>
<i>programs,</i> Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:09.176 --> 00:11.310
Bob's Burgers<i> and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.312 --> 00:14.213
What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

00:14.215 --> 00:15.447
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:23.324 --> 00:25.157
FOLKSY ANNOUNCER: Well, it's
the first Saturday in September,

00:25.159 --> 00:27.659
and that means one thing
in Springfield.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.695
It's that time again.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.830
Opening day of peewee football.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.165
(over P.A.):
And everybody's headed

00:33.167 --> 00:35.567
down to Child Soldier Field
to catch all the action.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.136
It all comes down to this,

00:37.138 --> 00:38.504
the first game of the year,

00:38.506 --> 00:40.172
perfect season on the line.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.674
And drunks are being rolled
off the field.

00:42.676 --> 00:43.742
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:43.744 --> 00:46.011
your Springfield Neutrinos!

00:46.013 --> 00:48.313
(crowd cheering)

00:50.584 --> 00:51.717
BART:
Huh?

00:51.719 --> 00:52.718
NELSON:
Where'd everybody go?

00:52.720 --> 00:53.719
BART:
I can't see.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.555
(gasps) They over-
fogged the run-in!

00:56.557 --> 00:58.023
They put those
kids in danger

00:58.025 --> 00:59.658
just to psych
up the crowd.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.193
Yeah, are you
psyched up now?

01:01.195 --> 01:02.394
Huh? Are you?!

01:02.396 --> 01:04.863
(players panicking,
helmets clonking)

01:04.865 --> 01:06.865
Concussions!

01:06.867 --> 01:09.435
Concessions!

01:11.072 --> 01:12.571
(door dings)
Aah!

01:12.573 --> 01:14.173
(anxious chatter)

01:14.175 --> 01:16.742
My boy hit his head
doing football!

01:16.744 --> 01:18.243
I'm a doctor's wife.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.079
Save my boy first!

01:20.081 --> 01:22.414
My boy needs an MRI!

01:22.416 --> 01:23.415
(clamoring)
Ow!

01:23.417 --> 01:24.416
Ow!
Ow!

01:24.418 --> 01:25.717
Ow! Ow!
Oh!

01:25.719 --> 01:26.718
(theme music playing)

01:26.720 --> 01:28.020
With head injury concerns

01:28.022 --> 01:29.788
on the mind,
the town has shut down

01:29.790 --> 01:31.290
its peewee football program.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.724
Professor, what
danger does this

01:32.726 --> 01:34.726
concussion threat
truly pose?

01:34.728 --> 01:35.761
Uh, well, Kent,

01:35.763 --> 01:37.796
these children will
need their brains

01:37.798 --> 01:40.799
unbruised for the demanding,
high-tech jobs

01:40.801 --> 01:41.800
of the future:

01:41.802 --> 01:45.270
polishing and buffing
our robot masters.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.305
Indeed.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.573
And here to
defend youth football,

01:47.575 --> 01:49.641
we have... Nelson's dad.

01:49.643 --> 01:50.809
Are you wearing makeup?

01:50.811 --> 01:52.811
Is it worth the risk
to your son's health

01:52.813 --> 01:55.314
when only .1 percent
of youth football players

01:55.316 --> 01:56.615
make it to the pros?

01:56.617 --> 01:58.617
You saying my boy doesn't
have what it takes

01:58.619 --> 02:00.119
to play pro ball? Huh?

02:00.121 --> 02:01.653
Boy, show him your moves.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.788
Juke it, juke it!

02:02.790 --> 02:04.957
(grunting)

02:04.959 --> 02:07.259
Why are you dekeing it
when I said juke it?

02:07.261 --> 02:08.293
Take a lap!

02:08.295 --> 02:09.461
Without football, Kent,
(Nelson groans)

02:09.463 --> 02:11.630
how are kids gonna learn
character like I did,

02:11.632 --> 02:13.132
you stupid fruit-munch?

02:13.134 --> 02:15.601
And what is your problem,
smart-nuts?

02:15.603 --> 02:16.602
(grunts)

02:16.604 --> 02:18.670
Which brings us
to this question:

02:18.672 --> 02:19.805
if not football,

02:19.807 --> 02:22.207
what sport is safe
for our children?

02:24.311 --> 02:26.778
But there are so many
club sports

02:26.780 --> 02:28.680
that can eat up
all our free time.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.815
What about baseball?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.150
(scoffs)
Baseball--

02:31.152 --> 02:32.484
rife with steroids!

02:32.486 --> 02:33.986
Then test for steroids!

02:33.988 --> 02:36.321
Oh and then there'll
be no home runs!

02:36.323 --> 02:39.158
(all arguing)
Um, I think
I-I may have a solution.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.159
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:40.161 --> 02:41.527
What about biathlon?

02:41.529 --> 02:44.196
That teaches kids to ski
and kill.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.330
How about Frisbee-golf?

02:45.332 --> 02:46.932
If I could just
have your attention...

02:46.934 --> 02:49.134
Hey, what about
Filipino tooth-fighting?

02:49.136 --> 02:52.137
It builds biting,
jaw strength and mouth work.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.306
The champion for a long time
was a dog.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.475
(groans) No one is
listening to me.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.809
Well, maybe no one
wants to hear

02:57.811 --> 02:59.144
your ridiculous idea.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.380
Let's go, we're late
for prenatal yoga.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.481
Milhouse is ten.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.983
Why are we still doing that?

03:04.985 --> 03:06.318
Poor Kirk.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.653
No one listens to him.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.988
Even Luann treats
him like garbage.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.990
(sighs)
Love's funny like that.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.025
Help him out.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.160
Make people listen
to his idea.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.361
Oh, why me?

03:16.363 --> 03:17.829
I only came to this concert

03:17.831 --> 03:19.665
because I was told
it was a potluck.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.666
(grunts)

03:20.668 --> 03:23.702
(groans)

03:23.704 --> 03:26.004
(arguing continues)

03:26.006 --> 03:28.507
Attention, smothering parents

03:28.509 --> 03:30.642
who only came
to hear themselves talk!

03:30.644 --> 03:32.511
You're an idiot!
(arguing quiets)

03:32.513 --> 03:35.581
This guy has as much
right to bore us

03:35.583 --> 03:37.015
as any of you!

03:37.017 --> 03:38.417
Take it away, buddy.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.652
(echoing):
<i>Buddy, buddy, buddy...</i>

03:40.654 --> 03:42.154
"Buddy." Huh.

03:42.156 --> 03:44.723
Um, I've got an exciting sport

03:44.725 --> 03:47.526
that's great exercise
a-and teaches teamwork.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.527
Lacrosse.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.229
La-what?
What-cross?

03:50.231 --> 03:51.363
What-what?

03:51.365 --> 03:52.364
Lacrosse.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.199
It's the perfect combination of

03:54.201 --> 03:56.668
America's two
least watched sports:

03:56.670 --> 03:58.270
soccer and hockey.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.405
(murmuring excitedly)

04:00.407 --> 04:02.374
Any kid can learn
to play lacrosse.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.609
Even this.

04:04.178 --> 04:05.377
(parents gasping)

04:05.379 --> 04:08.080
This isn't a drive-in movie.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.249
(parents gasping)

04:13.020 --> 04:14.286
Everybody,

04:14.288 --> 04:17.055
feel free to whip stuff
at my son's face.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.124
(laughter
and indistinct chatter)

04:21.228 --> 04:22.561
Yarr.

04:22.563 --> 04:23.695
Now hold on there.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.731
Lacrosse has the second highest
concussion rate,

04:25.733 --> 04:26.865
right after football.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.736
(chanting):
Safer than football!

04:30.738 --> 04:32.738
Safer
than football!

04:32.740 --> 04:34.773
Hey, why don't we
have this fruit-munch

04:34.775 --> 04:36.908
teach our kids
this crazy sport?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.810
Me, coach your kids?

04:38.812 --> 04:40.912
Most of you won't even
make eye contact

04:40.914 --> 04:43.148
when I'm weighing your yogurt.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.783
I'll do it.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.985
If Homer will coach with me.

04:46.987 --> 04:47.986
Huh?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.655
We've come too
far together

04:49.657 --> 04:51.290
on this crazy ride.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.125
It wouldn't feel right
to do it without you...

04:53.127 --> 04:54.126
buddy.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.261
(echoing):
<i>Buddy, buddy, buddy...</i>

04:56.263 --> 04:57.529
Mm?

04:59.600 --> 05:00.732
Oh, fine,

05:00.734 --> 05:02.434
I'll coach with this guy.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.835
But I promise you this:

05:03.837 --> 05:06.605
I will never stop
complaining about it.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.940
(cheering)

05:08.942 --> 05:11.143
(grumbling):
Stupid sport I never heard of...

05:11.145 --> 05:13.779
make me wake up early
on a Saturday...

05:13.781 --> 05:15.480
probably have to
slice oranges...

05:15.482 --> 05:16.615
Don't even know the rules

05:16.617 --> 05:18.150
because I refuse to learn 'em...

05:18.152 --> 05:20.319
my kids will probably suck
at it...

05:20.321 --> 05:21.486
And I'll have to kneel down

05:21.488 --> 05:24.323
on photo day,
knees get all wet...

05:24.325 --> 05:26.024
despite my bad attitude,

05:26.026 --> 05:28.460
I'm thrilled by the
nonstop action...

05:28.462 --> 05:30.128
kids running towards me

05:30.130 --> 05:32.531
with a look of joy
I've never seen before...

05:32.533 --> 05:34.099
Dad, we won!

05:34.101 --> 05:35.667
It's okay, kids.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.303
What matters is
you tried your best.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.971
Have an orange slice.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.473
No, we won!

05:41.475 --> 05:43.809
Yes, we're all winners.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.812
Because losing
teaches valuable lessons.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.480
Have an orange slice.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.648
We did it, buddy.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.817
You and I make
a great team.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.151
We won for real!

05:53.153 --> 05:55.053
For the first time in our lives,

05:55.055 --> 05:56.488
we can say "Good game"

05:56.490 --> 05:58.156
and actually mean it.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.391
Good game!

05:59.393 --> 06:00.826
Uh, good game!

06:00.828 --> 06:02.894
Ha! That's loser talk!

06:08.001 --> 06:11.069
(cheering)

06:11.071 --> 06:14.106
(groaning)

06:15.342 --> 06:17.209
Wow, pizza really does

06:17.211 --> 06:18.744
taste sweeter
after you win.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.979
(humming happily)

06:20.981 --> 06:21.980
Dude.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.849
My kids have never
won at anything.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.050
All the girl
does is read

06:25.052 --> 06:26.151
and the boy's
got one of those

06:26.153 --> 06:27.519
paying attention diseases

06:27.521 --> 06:29.154
that isn't really
a disease.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.856
Awesome job, guys!

06:30.858 --> 06:33.158
How do you know so
much about lacrosse?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.694
Wait. You want to know about me?

06:35.696 --> 06:37.696
(disinterested
mumbling)

06:37.698 --> 06:39.698
Well, it all goes back
to my college days,

06:39.700 --> 06:44.603
<i>where I was the star attackman</i>
<i>on our lacrosse team.</i>

06:44.605 --> 06:45.670
(crowd cheering)

06:45.672 --> 06:47.305
(marching band playing)

06:49.710 --> 06:52.043
<i>I'd even been drafted to play</i>
<i>in the pros</i>

06:52.045 --> 06:53.845
<i>for the Milwaukee Zoom.</i>

06:53.847 --> 06:56.415
<i>After scoring the</i>
<i>championship-winning goal,</i>

06:56.417 --> 06:58.216
<i>I was on top of the world, man.</i>

06:58.218 --> 07:00.218
<i>I was high-fiving everybody.</i>

07:00.220 --> 07:02.053
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

07:02.055 --> 07:04.723
<i>no one, and I mean no one,</i>
<i>was leaving me hanging.</i>

07:04.725 --> 07:05.891
<i>I was slap-happy,</i>

07:05.893 --> 07:08.126
<i>I couldn't stop myself,</i>
<i>until...</i>

07:09.396 --> 07:12.230
<i>I highed one five too far.</i>

07:12.232 --> 07:15.066
(metallic clank)
(wrist shattering)

07:15.068 --> 07:18.270
<i>Our school mascot,</i>
<i>Sir Gudge-a-lot.</i>

07:19.406 --> 07:20.605
(retching)

07:20.607 --> 07:23.642
<i>My Zoom dream died that day.</i>

07:23.644 --> 07:25.110
Mm...

07:25.112 --> 07:26.178
(grunts angrily)

07:27.147 --> 07:29.448
Uh... Ah...

07:29.450 --> 07:30.449
(metallic clicking)

07:30.451 --> 07:33.251
My wrist healed,
but my wrist in here...

07:33.253 --> 07:34.619
never did.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.489
I've never high-fived
my own son.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.624
The mascot wore
a suit of armor?

07:39.626 --> 07:40.792
Just like a knight!

07:40.794 --> 07:43.395
Yeah, but now lacrosse
has brought us together.

07:43.397 --> 07:45.630
Hey, a toast
to new friendship!

07:45.632 --> 07:48.433
Could I get a roll of
toilet paper, please?

07:48.435 --> 07:50.869
I get nosebleeds
when I drink.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.839
To... new...

07:53.841 --> 07:55.507
friendship.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.143
Mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.511
(Homer snoring)

08:00.681 --> 08:02.113
Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad!

08:02.115 --> 08:03.448
Dad, wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

08:03.450 --> 08:05.217
(moaning groggily)

08:09.823 --> 08:10.822
Oof!

08:10.824 --> 08:13.124
(Maggie coos)

08:13.126 --> 08:15.293
It's 6:00 a.m.
on a Saturday.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.662
We have a weekend
lacrosse tournament!

08:17.664 --> 08:19.197
(horn honking outside)
There's Coach K!

isn't just the same song

08:54.902 --> 08:56.501

08:56.503 --> 08:59.371
No, no, dude, they're
different live versions.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.340
You can tell because
some are longer.

Hey, you want a hit
off my vape pen?

09:04.545 --> 09:06.077

10:24.825 --> 10:26.658
Well, not that bad.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.160
I know Kirk's
a bit of a dizzy duck,

10:29.162 --> 10:31.963
but remember,
you're doing this for the kids.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.264
Right, right. The kids.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.633

10:44.645 --> 10:46.945
Which gentlemen's club
should we hit first,

10:46.947 --> 10:49.481
Skin City or
the Tassel Castle?

10:49.483 --> 10:50.615
Gentlemen's...

10:50.617 --> 10:51.850

10:51.852 --> 10:54.152
Yeah, Wiggles has
great dancers,

10:58.492 --> 11:00.158
Which, uh--
(chuckles) I do.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.160
Why would I want to go
to a strip club?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.995
I'm married to a naked lady.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.499
Drive time to Sapphire Diamond

11:09.803 --> 11:11.369
Hey, wa-- 38 minutes!

11:11.371 --> 11:13.805
Listen, Kirk, I'm a lot
of kind of guys--

11:13.807 --> 11:15.306
a booze guy,

11:15.308 --> 11:17.342
a don't-know-my-kids'-
birthdays guy,

11:17.344 --> 11:19.711
a steal-the-blow-dryer-
from-the-motel guy,

11:19.713 --> 11:22.647
but I am not a strip club guy.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.483

A jock!

11:35.729 --> 11:38.396
I didn't spit on my hand
for the post-game handshake.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.365
Hey, pal,
I don't like Kirk, either,

11:40.367 --> 11:44.002
but look how much fun
the kids' heads are having.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.737

11:45.739 --> 11:48.306
Of course I want to
hang with you, buddy.

But, you know, I'm pretty tired
from all those YouTube videos

11:51.311 --> 11:53.478
you showed me

I was only pretending to be his
friend for the sake of the team.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.478
But, but why did he empty out
our bank account,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.414

15:49.416 --> 15:50.648
Oh, no.

I'll also get him.

No, it's my husband's fault

to that jiggle joint
and only he can get him out.

17:32.585 --> 17:33.751
(depressed groaning)

17:33.753 --> 17:35.820
Oh, boy.
Oh, man.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.856
(worried moan)
WOMAN:
Hello.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.259
Uh, no, thank you.
Hey there, big guy.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.527
No, thank you.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.263
Happily married man
with no cash coming through.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.831
(panting)

17:46.833 --> 17:47.865
Made it.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.767
Nothing in this place
can tempt me.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.669
(moans)

17:51.671 --> 17:53.071
Oh, baby, yes.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.373
Those legs go on forever.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.075
(moans)

17:57.077 --> 17:58.743
Where are they?

17:58.745 --> 18:01.079
Maybe we shouldn't
have sent Homer Simpson

18:01.081 --> 18:02.246
into that den of sin.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.247
(Marge groans, Ms. Hoover gasps)

18:03.249 --> 18:05.116
My husband's a good man.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.517
He can do this.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.718
(chewing sounds)

18:07.720 --> 18:10.388
Oh, worst food I've ever had.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.756
So much...

18:11.758 --> 18:13.758
Is that guy still
in the champagne room?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.560
He hasn't slept in days.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.362
He brought a cooler
of rice sandwiches.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.231
He says they give him energy.

18:20.233 --> 18:23.901
Wait, who do I know
that likes rice sandwiches?

18:23.903 --> 18:28.206
(gasps)
Bart's friend's dad!

18:28.208 --> 18:30.108
So anyway, they
can't call it bourbon

18:30.110 --> 18:31.943
unless it's from Kentucky.

18:31.945 --> 18:35.446
It's the American bourbon...
He's not a loser
paying for lap dances;

18:35.448 --> 18:38.249
he's a loser
paying for listening.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.251
Kirk, we've got to go.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.320
The big game is
about to start.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.288
Come on... buddy?

18:44.290 --> 18:46.757
Oh, now I'm your
buddy again, huh?

18:46.759 --> 18:48.626
Well, guess what, buddy.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.963
Carmeleena and Bodacious
are my true friends.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.665
Nothing, nothing
that we had was real.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.834
Well, it was all fake.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.937
But, damn it, somehow you turned
our fat, lazy, loser kids

18:59.939 --> 19:01.272
into winners.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.841
Kirk Van Houten,
I don't like you.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.644
But I respect you.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.812
Respect?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.313
That's the one thing
you can't buy

19:09.315 --> 19:11.149
in a place like this.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.316
(loud peeling)

19:12.318 --> 19:15.186
I've got to get to that game!

19:15.188 --> 19:18.289
Hey, that's a great realization
you had there, pally.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.124
Now if we could just settle
this up, eh?

19:20.126 --> 19:22.160
$15,000?

19:22.162 --> 19:26.464
12 lap-dances an hour, times
three girls, times 56 hours,

19:26.466 --> 19:29.033
pole tax,
glitter recycling fee.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.501
It's quite a ride.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.502
(grunts)

19:31.504 --> 19:32.837
(men coughing, Kirk yells)

19:45.885 --> 19:49.153
Aw, we'll never
make it to the game.

19:49.155 --> 19:52.323
Our kids were depending on
us and we let them down.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.525
You let them down. You.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.993
Did you say kids?

19:55.995 --> 19:57.695
We all have kids.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.664
We'd do anything for 'em.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.499
(babies cooing,
nursery music plays)

20:01.501 --> 20:05.670
Come on, working moms, let's
get these dads to that game.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.572
I'm sorry, kids, but
your coaches aren't here.

20:07.574 --> 20:08.906
You're going to have to forfeit.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.076
And now to blow this
whistle and make it official.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.378
(gust of wind,
helicopter blades spinning)

20:14.380 --> 20:15.880
It's the Strip-a-copter!

20:15.882 --> 20:18.816
I mean, it's a helicopter
I've never rented before.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.654
Helmet up, kids.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.524
Let's win ourselves
a championship.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.694
Who wants orange slices?

20:29.696 --> 20:31.095
(cheering)

20:31.097 --> 20:32.763
ALL:
Yay!

20:34.200 --> 20:37.368
No matter how bad our kids screw
up the rest of their lives,

20:37.370 --> 20:39.704
they'll always have this moment.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.206
Buddy, you deserve this.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.374
(exclaims quietly)

20:43.376 --> 20:44.909
(bones cracking,
Homer and Kirk scream)

20:44.911 --> 20:46.611
Just because we're in traction

20:46.613 --> 20:49.413

are super pumped
for my latest Crush video.

21:17.143 --> 21:19.277
Sorry, no contest winner
this week.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.945
Remember, to qualify,

21:20.947 --> 21:23.948
you have to be a subscriber
and leave a comment.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.817
Now, the secret
to the ultimate rice sammy

21:26.819 --> 21:30.621
is to make sure the rice is
really wet, li-like soaking.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.622
(high-pitched scrubbing)

21:31.624 --> 21:33.157
(chews and slurps)

21:33.159 --> 21:34.292
(high-pitched scrubbing)

21:34.294 --> 21:37.261
So after going in
to find it a third time,

21:37.263 --> 21:40.498
they just decided to leave the
colonoscopy camera inside...

21:40.500 --> 21:41.499
(high-pitched scrubbing)

21:41.501 --> 21:42.800
Five words:

21:42.802 --> 21:45.603
jet fuel can't melt steel.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.604
(high-pitched scrubbing)

21:46.606 --> 21:47.938
When I held the door
for that guy

21:47.940 --> 21:50.641
and he didn't even say
thank you, I just lost it!

21:50.643 --> 21:51.809
(high-pitched scrubbing)

21:51.811 --> 21:55.179
Oh, man, Milwaukee
would've been so sweet.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.515
The Zoom were the kings
of that town!

21:57.517 --> 21:58.582
