00:29.116 --> 00:31.379
Now squeeze
the icing from the bottom.

00:31.422 --> 00:36.166
Then ever so lightly
just glide along.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.689
That's right.

00:37.733 --> 00:40.214
- So who taught you
how to do this, Daddy?

00:40.257 --> 00:41.563
- My dad.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.391
And someday you'll
teach our children.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.222
One day this'll be yours, Sadie.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.095
- Only if that's what she wants.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.576
You can be anything
you want, Sadie.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.753
A doctor, a lawyer,
or a scientist.

00:57.796 --> 00:59.581
The sky's the limit.

00:59.624 --> 01:02.366
Maybe you'll
be an astronaut.

01:02.410 --> 01:06.631
- I wanna be a great
chocolatier, just like Daddy.

01:38.620 --> 01:39.534
Sadie.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.101
- Maggie, you wanted to see me?

01:41.144 --> 01:42.276
- Come on in. Sit down.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.978
We heard back from the client.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.414
You did?

01:50.458 --> 01:52.721
- They were very positive.
They love your new ideas.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.681
But they decided to
stick with last year's campaign.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.337
- They said they
wanted something fresh.

02:00.381 --> 02:03.123
- Apparently, fresh meant
a new font or new colors.

02:05.081 --> 02:06.909
Hmm, I know it's disappointing.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.998
You put a lot of time
into that project.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.958
- I can come up with
something different.

02:13.002 --> 02:15.918
- You did a great job. They're
just not ready for a change.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.967
So are you going away
for the holidays?

02:22.838 --> 02:24.361
- No, I'm staying here.

02:24.405 --> 02:27.234
I mean, not here but in town.

02:27.277 --> 02:30.628
So if you need anything,
I'm 100% available.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.282
- That's what I like to hear.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.070
Merry Christmas, Sadie.

02:38.114 --> 02:38.941
- You too.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.641
- Maybe once a year or so.

02:43.685 --> 02:44.381
And...

02:44.425 --> 02:45.252
Oh, sorry.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.648
Hello.

02:50.692 --> 02:52.520
Michael, are
you at the airport?

02:52.563 --> 02:55.871
- No, I'm stuck at this
Christmas work thing. You know?

02:55.914 --> 02:57.960
- Can't you just sneak out?

02:58.003 --> 03:00.180
- Wish I could, but
it's a sit-down dinner.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.050
Can't just leave.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.880
- You're gonna miss your flight.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.664
I can't help it.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.929
- Should I check
flights for tomorrow?

03:10.973 --> 03:12.888
- No, no, don't do that.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.933
I was thinking I
might just stay.

03:14.977 --> 03:17.371
It's actually kind of nice
here during the holidays.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.547
- But we made plans.

03:19.590 --> 03:23.899
- Oh, I know, but
work's been so busy

03:23.942 --> 03:26.554
and you know, I could
really use some time off.

03:26.597 --> 03:27.381
You get it.

03:28.556 --> 03:29.557
- No, I know, I've
been busy too,

03:29.600 --> 03:32.386
but I made my plans around you.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.736
- Oh, I hate that.

03:36.564 --> 03:37.739
But I think this is best.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.178
When I get back in the
States, I'll give you a call.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.048
- Okay?

03:43.962 --> 03:45.616
- I gotta get back to the party.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.575
- I thought you said
it wasn't a party.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.535
- Can't hear you.
Merry Christmas, Sadie.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.106
- You too.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.075
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.773
- You take off early?

04:11.816 --> 04:13.427
- There wasn't much
going on today.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.257
- Are you gonna eat the
rest of the Thai food?

04:18.301 --> 04:19.128
- No, go ahead.

04:20.564 --> 04:21.739
I need to finish packing.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.265
- What? Why?

04:26.788 --> 04:27.745
- I'm going home.

04:28.659 --> 04:29.704
For what?

04:31.227 --> 04:33.142
- 'Cause Michael's staying
in Europe for the holidays.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.144
So there's no reason
for me to stay.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.014
You're leaving.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.626
- I can't believe he did that.

04:42.847 --> 04:43.631
I'm sorry.

04:44.849 --> 04:45.807
- Don't be.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.113
He's not the one.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.724
He made that very clear.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.161
Early new year's resolution,

04:52.204 --> 04:54.381
no waiting around for
boys to act like men.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.166
- Agreed. No more
waiting around.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.170
- Are you gonna wear this?

05:01.213 --> 05:05.870
- It's a gift from
my mom.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.829
My boss said they
really liked my ideas,

05:07.872 --> 05:10.310
but they're sticking with
what they already have.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.487
- At least I liked your ideas.

05:14.705 --> 05:15.967
- Doesn't matter
if you don't win.

05:16.011 --> 05:18.187
It's like a participation award.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.799
- I'm never using
their products again.

05:23.671 --> 05:24.802
- Thanks.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.025
- Are you leaving
tomorrow morning?

05:30.068 --> 05:32.027
- Yep. Only one flight left.

05:32.070 --> 05:34.769
- Good. That means we can
open presents tonight.

05:34.812 --> 05:37.424
- You're gonna love your
matching Christmas sweater.

06:02.057 --> 06:04.407
- Oh, do you remember this one?

06:04.451 --> 06:07.410
I think it was third
or was it fourth grade?

06:07.454 --> 06:09.238
- I remember making this.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.895
- I'm so glad you made it home.

06:13.938 --> 06:17.289
- Decorating the tree without
you just isn't the same.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.248
- And I thought you'd
already have enough by now.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.859
- Yeah, well, every year
Christmas comes quicker

06:21.903 --> 06:23.861
or I'm getting slower.

06:25.559 --> 06:26.908
- Has the shop been busy.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.651
- That time of year.

06:30.694 --> 06:33.044
- I could help out if
you want? I have time.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.829
- That would be great.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.921
- Your dad wants to
tell you something.

06:40.835 --> 06:41.575
- What is it?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.796
- Well, we didn't wanna
tell you over the phone.

06:45.840 --> 06:49.104
- I don't like the way I look
on his face calls.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.759
- What's wrong? Are you okay?

06:57.808 --> 06:59.897
- We sold the place.
We're retiring.

07:00.855 --> 07:01.943
- You're kidding?

07:01.986 --> 07:03.423
- It's exciting isn't it?

07:04.772 --> 07:06.948
- But you're not old.
Why would you retire?

07:06.991 --> 07:08.558
You love it.

07:08.602 --> 07:11.909
- That's sweet. But we are
older than we used to be.

07:11.953 --> 07:15.739
- That's what I thought,
but Alex made us an offer.

07:15.783 --> 07:16.914
- Just because
someone wants to buy

07:16.958 --> 07:19.003
doesn't mean you have to sell.

07:19.047 --> 07:21.092
- Oh, honey, we don't
wanna work forever.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.616
- Your mother wants to travel.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.966
Before we get
too old to enjoy it.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.881
- You remember my friend Harry?

07:26.924 --> 07:29.579
He retired and he
plays golf every day.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.929
- But you've never
once played golf.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.975
- Exactly. Now
I'll have the time.

07:34.018 --> 07:35.542
- And we'll be
able to visit you.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.370
- You never know
when an opportunity

07:38.414 --> 07:39.633
like this'll come again.

07:41.809 --> 07:44.594
- I just can't imagine
us without Annedore's.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.161
Especially this time of year.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.512
- You should meet him.

07:49.556 --> 07:50.426
- You'll like him.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.342
Come
by in the morning.

07:54.299 --> 07:55.475
- Yeah, maybe.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.782
You're happy I'm
home, aren't you?

08:09.314 --> 08:12.230
What are you gonna do
while Dad's playing golf?

08:12.274 --> 08:15.059
- Hmm. Maybe I'll
take up a new hobby.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.061
- Next time I come home,
you'll be doing yoga,

08:17.105 --> 08:19.020
and Dad's gonna be
wearing white shoes.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.766
- Sadie, you know we didn't
make this decision lightly.

08:27.028 --> 08:28.899
Annedore's is like
part of our family

08:28.943 --> 08:31.946
and I know it feels like that

08:31.989 --> 08:33.991
we're handing her
off to a stranger.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.429
- Who's the stranger?

08:37.473 --> 08:40.520
- Alex Mitchell. He's very nice.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.914
Think you will like him.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.525
You just gotta
give him a chance.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.484
- I'm meeting Taylor first
thing in the morning.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.573
I can stop by after that.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.705
- That's a great idea.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.534
You want some more sprinkles?

08:54.577 --> 08:55.839
You don't have any sprinkles.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.581
- Yes, please. I think
it's sprinkle time.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.904
We're decorating the Christmas
tree and all of a sudden,

09:16.947 --> 09:18.732
they basically said,
"Merry Christmas,

09:18.775 --> 09:20.777
"we've sold your
childhood memories."

09:20.821 --> 09:23.084
- I don't think you
can sell memories.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.916
- How could they sell
Annedore's without telling me?

09:28.959 --> 09:31.440
- They probably knew
how you'd react.

09:32.963 --> 09:35.096
- Thought it was
going to be mine.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.925
- Maybe they thought you
weren't interested anymore.

09:37.968 --> 09:40.101
You did move away.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.755
- I'm still part of the family.

09:43.104 --> 09:46.107
- So you'd move back
and take over the store?

09:48.326 --> 09:51.895
- I don't know, but
I'd like to be asked.

09:51.939 --> 09:52.940
So tell them.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.247
- Why? It's already done.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.556
- You thought you were spending
Christmas in California,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.646
but here you are with me.

10:03.690 --> 10:07.215
When I was a kid,

10:08.695 --> 10:11.088
I thought I was going to
work at Annedore's forever.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.222
When did things
get so complicated?

10:15.223 --> 10:17.051
- I think it's called
being an adult.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.100
- I have to go and
meet Mr. Scrooge,

10:23.144 --> 10:25.189
who's stealing Christmas.

10:25.233 --> 10:28.932
- Scrooge was stingy. He
didn't steal Christmas.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.064
- That's why I
didn't like playing

10:30.107 --> 10:33.154
Christmas trivia
with you.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.244
- Well, call me and we'll
go Christmas shopping.

10:36.287 --> 10:36.984
- I will.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.252
- Oh!

11:07.405 --> 11:10.191
- You don't think
he saw that, do you?

11:10.234 --> 11:12.541
Probably not.

11:13.977 --> 11:14.761
Maybe.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.764
Who cares? You'll
never see him again.

11:18.634 --> 11:21.419
- Oh my gosh.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.313
- Sadie, you made it.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.969
- I think I miss the smell
of chocolate most of all.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.274
- Oh.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.799
Well, I'm gonna sneak
in just for the smell.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.191
I can't go cold turkey.

11:55.976 --> 11:57.238
- Where's Ebenezer?

11:57.281 --> 11:58.108
- What?

11:58.152 --> 11:59.240
The buyer.

11:59.283 --> 12:02.199
- Oh, Alex? He's not in yet.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.462
- He obviously
doesn't have any idea

12:04.506 --> 12:06.421
what it takes to make chocolate.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.379
The early mornings,
the late nights.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.904
- Try to be nice. He's learning.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.602
- I will, but he needs to
know what he's getting into.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.082
It's only fair.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.866
Morning.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.781
- Good morning, Alex.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.914
Alex, I'd like you to
meet my daughter, Sadie.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.263
Sadie, Alex.

12:23.264 --> 12:24.700
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.268
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.749
I've heard so many
wonderful things about you.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.925
Your dad goes on and on.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.187
- He has?

12:33.230 --> 12:34.536
- Yes.

12:34.579 --> 12:37.060
And I think Sadie would
be the perfect person

12:37.104 --> 12:38.670
to finish your training, Alex.

12:38.714 --> 12:40.455
She was just reminding
me of a few things

12:40.498 --> 12:41.848
she thought you
might need to know.

12:41.891 --> 12:42.631
Right, Sadie?

12:42.674 --> 12:44.111
- Me? No.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.808
It's been so long,

12:45.852 --> 12:48.289
I don't think I should be
teaching anyone anything.

12:48.332 --> 12:49.725
- Don't be silly.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.596
You can make a perfect
truffle in your sleep,

12:53.120 --> 12:55.122
- Well, I'm a willing student.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.039
- Fine.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.171
Where do we start?

13:01.215 --> 13:04.479
- Well, do you know what it
takes to be a chocolatier?

13:05.567 --> 13:06.307
- Chocolate.

13:07.395 --> 13:10.137
- Yes. And commitment.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.443
- Okay.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.837
- It's long hours, not just
when the store is open,

13:14.881 --> 13:17.840
you have to be here early,
and you're here late.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.842
Do you think you're up to that?

13:19.886 --> 13:22.410
- Well, I had to travel
a lot for my last job.

13:22.453 --> 13:25.456
So as long as I could
just sleep in my own bed,

13:25.500 --> 13:26.283
I'll be fine.

13:27.937 --> 13:31.375
- People don't realize,
chocolate's not
all fun and games.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.334
It's a lot of work.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.335
- I'm ready.

13:38.556 --> 13:39.688
- A lot of these recipes

13:39.731 --> 13:41.211
were handed down
from my grandfather.

13:42.386 --> 13:43.997
So I wouldn't want them
to be given to someone

13:44.040 --> 13:47.348
that doesn't realize just
how special they are.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.524
They took years to perfect.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.352
- I realize.

13:51.395 --> 13:52.788
- There are plenty
of competitors

13:52.832 --> 13:54.921
that would like to get
their hands on our recipes.

13:54.964 --> 13:58.489
- I will guard them
with my life. Okay?

13:58.533 --> 14:03.538
I mean, not literally,
obviously, but I'll
keep them safe.

14:04.452 --> 14:05.018
- Do you know anything?

14:07.585 --> 14:08.804
- About chocolate?

14:09.631 --> 14:11.198
- Yes, about chocolate.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.375
- You know, so far,
your dad's just shown me

14:14.418 --> 14:15.550
the business side of things.

14:15.593 --> 14:20.163
So, no, but I'm a fast learner.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.383
- It's not a race.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.950
You don't learn chocolate fast.

14:24.994 --> 14:25.821
- Right.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.522
- We'll start with truffles.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.394
- Like mushrooms?

14:33.437 --> 14:35.744
- Let's start at
the very beginning.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.006
- Works for me.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.399
- Chocolate truffles
got their name

14:38.442 --> 14:40.270
because they resemble
a very expensive fungus

14:40.314 --> 14:42.055
found in Italy and France.

14:42.098 --> 14:45.580
- And truffle sounds a lot
more appetizing than fungus.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.540
- The chocolate truffle was
discovered by accident really.

14:49.584 --> 14:52.152
The assistant for a French
chef accidentally spilled

14:52.195 --> 14:56.460
hot cream into a bowl of
expensive chopped chocolate.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.810
He was very angry, but
when he stirred it,

14:58.854 --> 15:02.075
it became a sauce, and
when it cooled it hardened.

15:02.118 --> 15:05.208
He worked the chocolate
paste with his hands

15:05.252 --> 15:08.908
until it formed a bumpy
walnut-sized ball.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.780
And he rolled it in cocoa powder

15:11.823 --> 15:13.956
and it looked a
lot like a truffle.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.610
And that's where
they got their name.

15:23.444 --> 15:24.575
- Now, it's your turn.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.797
Here it goes nothing.

15:32.366 --> 15:35.456
- You know, your parents said
you were a natural at this.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.545
I don't think they
were exaggerating.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.243
- I grew up watching my father.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.636
I knew how to make chocolates

15:41.679 --> 15:43.420
before I knew how
to tie my shoe.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.466
At least, that's
what they tell me.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.122
- I understand why you
wouldn't want me here.

15:50.427 --> 15:51.472
- What?

15:51.515 --> 15:52.603
- I don't blame you.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.475
I mean, you're
teaching me something

15:54.518 --> 15:56.999
that you've known how
to do your entire life,

15:57.043 --> 15:59.610
only for me to take
it away from you.

15:59.654 --> 16:02.483
- You're not taking
anything away from me.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.964
- Okay. Guess I was wrong.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.619
- I'm happy for them.
Why wouldn't I be?

16:10.404 --> 16:11.448
- Nailed it.

16:12.536 --> 16:13.276
What's next.

16:14.277 --> 16:15.583
- That, again.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.065
- You're tougher than you look.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.022
- Do you wanna
learn this online?

16:20.066 --> 16:22.677
- No. No, definitely not.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.680
I'm kidding. Show me
one more time, please.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.991
- You can't skimp
on the chocolate.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.994
You have to chop the
pieces really fine.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.345
Once you mix it with the cream,

16:38.388 --> 16:41.174
wait for it to cool,
and roll it into balls.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.523
Got it?

16:42.566 --> 16:43.480
- Got it.

16:43.524 --> 16:44.829
- Now we can move on.

16:46.483 --> 16:47.397
- Okay.

16:53.403 --> 16:54.796
So how did today go?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.538
- A little bumpy
with Alex today.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.020
She's concerned he's
not serious enough.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.718
No one's
serious enough for Sadie.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.679
- First, she gave him the
complete history of the truffle.

17:08.723 --> 17:12.466
I'm not sure
he needs that much detail.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.686
Did she get around to
showing him how to make them?

17:17.123 --> 17:19.212
- You should have seen her.

17:19.255 --> 17:20.474
It was like she never left.

17:44.933 --> 17:45.716
- Thanks.

17:47.936 --> 17:51.592
- I hear your dad coerced you
into working with Alex today.

17:51.635 --> 17:55.074
- You said to be supportive.
So I'm being supportive.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.379
- What'd you think of him?

17:58.860 --> 18:00.427
Change is never easy.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.430
- It's gonna be weird.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.693
No Annedore's.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.565
Seriously, what
are you gonna do?

18:09.436 --> 18:10.741
- I don't know.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.004
Maybe we'll get one of
those big motorhomes

18:13.048 --> 18:14.484
and travel all over.

18:15.616 --> 18:18.314
Just see where the
wind blows us.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.055
- You really want
this, don't you?

18:22.188 --> 18:24.581
- Annedore's is just
one piece of our life.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.453
It's not our entire identity.

18:27.584 --> 18:28.629
And now it's over.

18:30.718 --> 18:31.458
- I guess so.

18:33.024 --> 18:35.592
- I'm excited to see what
the next chapter looks like.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.074
- You're right, I've only
been thinking about me,

18:39.118 --> 18:39.988
not you and Dad.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.993
- And I'm sorry things with
Michael didn't turn out,

18:45.820 --> 18:47.474
but I'm glad you're here.

18:48.475 --> 18:49.563
- Me too.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.479
- It's gonna be a
great Christmas.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.746
We should have a
party. A retirement party.

18:58.789 --> 19:01.052
- We don't need to add one
more thing to the list.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.663
- I know, but we
have to celebrate

19:02.706 --> 19:05.448
what you and Dad have
done, and what comes next.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.058
- That's very thoughtful, Sadie.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.191
- We can have it
on Christmas Eve.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.498
We used to have people over
on Christmas Eve all the time.

19:11.541 --> 19:14.370
- But Christmas Eve
is only a week away.

19:14.414 --> 19:17.025
- I'll take care of
everything. I promise.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.206
- Sounds like you have
your mind made up.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.339
Just like when you
were a little girl.

19:27.644 --> 19:28.689
Night, honey.

19:29.646 --> 19:30.430
- Night.

19:54.758 --> 19:55.977
Morning.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.761
You're here
early this morning.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.199
- Chocolate doesn't
make itself, sir.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.548
- Very funny.

20:01.591 --> 20:04.551
- No, it's not. I take
chocolate very seriously.

20:04.594 --> 20:07.554
- I may have been a tad
bit harsh yesterday.

20:07.597 --> 20:10.252
- I'm just surprised you
showed up at all today.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.515
I figured you had
better things to do

20:12.559 --> 20:16.737
with your Christmas vacation,
then spend it here with me.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.999
- That's where you're wrong.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.827
I have absolutely
nothing better to do.

20:21.655 --> 20:22.699
You know what I mean.

20:23.918 --> 20:26.268
- There's nowhere
else you'd rather be?

20:26.312 --> 20:29.358
- Well, I could go Christmas
shopping if you prefer?

20:29.402 --> 20:30.272
It's up to you.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.100
- No, please, stay.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.537
- Okay.

20:34.581 --> 20:35.582
I thought we could start with
peanut brittle this morning

20:35.625 --> 20:37.584
and then move on to toffee.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.063
- Okay.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.804
- We only make peanut
brittle around the holidays,

20:40.848 --> 20:42.458
but everyone loves.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.721
- So why not keep it
in stock all year?

20:44.765 --> 20:45.635
- We like to keep what we make

20:45.679 --> 20:47.158
to a limited number of items,

20:47.202 --> 20:49.944
that way we can make
everything in-store.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.902
- So why not outsource it then?

20:53.339 --> 20:55.341
- Because that's
not how we do it.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.561
- Did you ever hear the story
of the girl who asked her mom

20:58.605 --> 21:01.172
why she cut the ends off of
her ham before she cooked it?

21:01.216 --> 21:02.652
- No.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.393
- Well, her mom
said it's because

21:04.437 --> 21:05.742
that's how her mother did it.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.440
So she called her mom

21:07.483 --> 21:09.442
and asked her why she cut
the ends off of her ham?

21:09.485 --> 21:10.791
And her mother said

21:10.834 --> 21:13.228
she didn't have a pot
big enough to cook it in.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.492
- Well, have you ever
heard the saying,

21:16.536 --> 21:18.277
if it ain't broke, don't fix it?

21:19.843 --> 21:22.324
- Touche. Carry on.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.325
- Okay.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.935
Are we done telling stories?

21:24.979 --> 21:27.111
- If I find a few ways
to help the bottom line,

21:27.155 --> 21:28.765
I don't think that's a crime.

21:30.898 --> 21:34.118
- Okay. Forget peanut brittle,
someone else will make that.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.598
How do you feel about toffee?

21:35.642 --> 21:37.470
- Feel great about it.

21:37.513 --> 21:38.297
- Okay.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.650
- Both caramel and toffee

21:43.693 --> 21:46.000
are a process of
caramelizing the sugar.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.132
That's where you get
that smoky taste.

21:48.176 --> 21:50.613
- And caramel is chewier, right?

21:50.657 --> 21:51.788
- You cook toffee at
a higher temperature.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.442
That's what makes it crunchy.

21:57.751 --> 21:58.839
Now we let that cool,

21:58.882 --> 22:00.014
and then we can cut
it into squares,

22:00.057 --> 22:01.624
and dip it in milk
or dark chocolate.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.670
- Mm, dark chocolate.
Definitely.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.367
That's my favorite.

22:05.411 --> 22:06.150
- Mine too.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.154
Throwing a party for my parents

22:10.198 --> 22:12.026
to celebrate their retirement.

22:12.069 --> 22:14.507
It's Christmas Eve.
You should come.

22:15.856 --> 22:16.987
- Really?

22:17.031 --> 22:18.989
- You are the reason
they're retiring.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.949
And you can bring
someone if you want?

22:23.429 --> 22:26.388
- Okay, well, do you need me
to bring any food or anything?

22:26.432 --> 22:29.391
- No, I'm hiring a caterer
and I'm making the dessert.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.612
- Well, if you change your
mind, I make a mean toffee.

22:32.655 --> 22:33.961
- I'll keep that in mind.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.181
- Oh.

22:37.225 --> 22:38.792
- You need to go?

22:38.835 --> 22:42.448
- Yeah, I have to be someplace,
but just for this week.

22:43.753 --> 22:47.235
I promise I'm 100%
committed to chocolate.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.637
- What about this one?

22:58.942 --> 22:59.900
- Oh, that's lovely.

22:59.943 --> 23:00.857
- Looks good to me.

23:02.293 --> 23:06.733
- Okay. "December
24th, 7:00 p.m."

23:07.951 --> 23:09.736
Can you send me your
guest list today?

23:10.954 --> 23:12.869
- Seems like an awful
lot of work for you?

23:12.913 --> 23:15.611
- It's fine. I have
everything under control.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.874
- You'll be too busy to
finish Alex's training.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.572
- No, it's okay. I can do it.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.096
- Are you sure?

23:22.139 --> 23:23.750
- Yeah, of course.

23:23.793 --> 23:24.577
- Thank goodness.

23:26.448 --> 23:29.625
Teaching new employees has
never been my strong suit.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.453
- He's not gonna be
an employee, Dad.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.933
He's going to be
running the business,

23:32.976 --> 23:34.848
so he needs to know
everything he can.

23:50.646 --> 23:53.214
Sticky drunken pears?

23:53.257 --> 23:54.433
Mm-mm

23:56.173 --> 23:57.479
- Blood orange souffles?

23:57.523 --> 23:58.306
- Blood?

24:00.395 --> 24:02.310
- Sticky toffee pudding?

24:02.353 --> 24:03.964
- What about figgy pudding?

24:07.315 --> 24:08.534
- This is it.
- Hmm.

24:09.709 --> 24:10.753
- I could make
everyone their own

24:10.797 --> 24:12.973
individual gingerbread house.

24:13.843 --> 24:15.802
- How many guests will there be?

24:15.845 --> 24:16.977
- Not sure yet.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.241
- I've always wanted to learn

24:20.284 --> 24:22.330
how to build a
gingerbread house.

24:22.373 --> 24:23.940
- Well, let's do it.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.072
- Now?

24:26.377 --> 24:27.161
Okay.

24:30.251 --> 24:33.123
Well, I have, we just
used graham cracker.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.821
- Graham crackers?
- Yeah.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.170
Use them as the building blocks

24:36.213 --> 24:38.477
and then we just
cover it all candy.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.828
- A lot of people make
their houses for structure

24:41.871 --> 24:43.525
and forget about the taste.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.963
But my grandfather's recipe
is both strong and delicious.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.662
So you don't have to worry
about them falling apart.

24:49.705 --> 24:53.361
- Why don't you just make
one of those big castles

24:53.404 --> 24:56.016
or like one big
skyscraper or something?

24:56.059 --> 24:58.061
Like they do in
those competitions?

24:58.105 --> 25:00.411
- Gingerbread houses
are about tradition.

25:00.455 --> 25:03.937
Like the ones we make
every year, not a contest.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.374
- Right.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.724
- Besides, there's no way to
improve on a little cottage

25:08.768 --> 25:10.378
that looks like it's
from a fairytale.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.553
- Yeah.

25:11.597 --> 25:12.946
Yeah, if it ain't broke...

25:16.427 --> 25:17.516
The guest list.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.388
- Showing Alex how
to make gingerbread.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.738
- The secret is just the
right amount of strength

25:22.782 --> 25:24.174
to hold it together.

25:24.218 --> 25:25.393
Good to know.

25:28.483 --> 25:29.963
- We're gonna need a few more

25:30.006 --> 25:32.226
gingerbread houses
than I thought.

25:32.269 --> 25:33.053
- How many?

25:34.750 --> 25:36.839
- Like, maybe, 50?

25:38.014 --> 25:39.320
- People?

25:39.363 --> 25:42.889
- I don't know. I'll just
have to make it work.

25:42.932 --> 25:46.196
- Okay.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.024
- My mom just sent another list.

25:49.025 --> 25:50.418
How many on that?

25:50.461 --> 25:53.987
- There's just as
many or maybe more.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.729
That many people won't
even fit in our house.

25:56.772 --> 25:57.425
- Well, they won't all come.

25:58.469 --> 25:59.514
They never do.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.820
- Are you sure?

26:00.863 --> 26:01.647
- Yeah.

26:03.344 --> 26:07.130
All right, why don't
you just explain to them

26:07.174 --> 26:09.002
that they need to
pare-down their lists?

26:09.045 --> 26:11.091
Tell them you weren't
expecting that many.

26:11.134 --> 26:12.527
- I can't.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.573
How do you tell someone
to choose between friends?

26:15.791 --> 26:18.098
- What are you gonna do?

26:18.141 --> 26:23.016
- Find a bigger place, order
more food, buy decorations.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.104
Take out a loan.

26:49.651 --> 26:50.434
The 24th.

26:51.653 --> 26:52.785
Yes, this year.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.266
Okay. Thanks.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.442
Is there anywhere else
you could recommend?

27:00.923 --> 27:04.144
No, you're right. Next time
I'll plan further ahead.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.145
Thanks.
- Any luck?

27:06.668 --> 27:09.105
If wanna
have it next year.

27:09.149 --> 27:10.498
- Oh.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.979
You know, I might know of
a place you can have it.

27:13.022 --> 27:13.980
- Really?

27:14.023 --> 27:14.981
- Yeah.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.722
Let me make a call.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.201
That would
be great. Thank you.

27:18.245 --> 27:19.812
- Of course.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.640
- It needs to be big enough
to accommodate 100 people,

27:21.683 --> 27:23.380
but not too big either.

27:23.424 --> 27:26.732
I want it to feel warm and cozy.

27:26.775 --> 27:28.647
- Okay. Big but not too big.

27:28.690 --> 27:29.952
Warm and cozy.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.693
Got it. Anything else?

27:31.737 --> 27:33.303
- Nope. That's it.

27:33.347 --> 27:34.870
- Okay. I'll be back.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.567
Thank you.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.320
Hasn't this place
been closed for years?

27:50.364 --> 27:53.149
- Yeah. Let me get the lights.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.068
Do you know Ernest Hemingway

27:59.112 --> 28:01.288
sat right there
by the fireplace?

28:02.332 --> 28:06.075
Frank Sinatra, Bob
Hope, even The Beatles.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.294
They all stayed here.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.992
- Thanks for the
historical tour,

28:10.036 --> 28:12.821
but I can't afford this place.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.824
- Just picture it filled
with Christmas decorations.

28:17.173 --> 28:21.003
- It's beautiful, but it's
way more than I can spend.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.483
- Every other place is booked.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.441
- I'll keep looking.

28:24.485 --> 28:25.704
There's gotta be some.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.881
- Hey, if you like
it, it's yours.

28:31.187 --> 28:32.754
- How?

28:32.798 --> 28:35.191
- Let's just say I have a
friend that knows a guy.

28:36.627 --> 28:38.978
Just have to leave it
exactly how we found it.

28:40.066 --> 28:40.893
- You're kidding?

28:41.981 --> 28:42.721
- You like it?

28:43.765 --> 28:46.159
- It's perfect.

28:46.202 --> 28:48.422
We could put a big
Christmas tree over there

28:48.465 --> 28:50.206
with food stations.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.904
Keeps people moving
and mingling.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.080
- I love a good food station.

28:56.212 --> 28:57.039
- You hungry?

28:57.779 --> 28:58.606
- Always.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.564
- I know a place.

29:24.501 --> 29:28.636
my true love gave to me

29:32.031 --> 29:36.165
my true love gave to me

29:36.209 --> 29:39.908
partridge in a pear tree

29:39.952 --> 29:41.605
- That one's good.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.477
That one's definitely
my favorite.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.131
- That was my favorite too.

29:45.174 --> 29:46.480
- How did I not know that

29:46.523 --> 29:49.135
food tasting was the
thing before this?

29:49.178 --> 29:49.962
Well.

29:50.005 --> 29:51.093
- Last bite's yours.

29:52.225 --> 29:53.661
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

29:54.967 --> 29:55.794
- Okay.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.102
That says a lot about a man.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.451
- What?

30:05.629 --> 30:08.023
- It means you're thoughtful.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.808
You didn't just pop
it in your mouth.

30:11.113 --> 30:13.333
- Guess you can blame
my mother for that.

30:13.376 --> 30:16.553
She always made me offer the
last piece to my sisters.

30:16.597 --> 30:17.946
- How many sisters?

30:17.990 --> 30:19.469
- Two.

30:19.513 --> 30:22.603
I'm in the middle, and pretty
much everything you hear

30:22.646 --> 30:24.823
about middle child is true.

30:27.042 --> 30:30.219
- I'm none of the things you
hear about an only child.

30:30.263 --> 30:31.003
I'm not bossy.

30:32.091 --> 30:33.962
I'm not!
- I didn't say anything.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.098
- Are you still close
with your family?

30:39.141 --> 30:40.882
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.536
Yeah, I am.

30:42.579 --> 30:44.103
I moved away for a bit.

30:44.146 --> 30:47.715
I went to Chicago after
college, then I came back here.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.023
I like it here
though. It's home.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.853
- I didn't even plan on coming
home for Christmas this year.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.245
- Really?

30:56.289 --> 30:58.160
Whatever it was that
changed your mind,

30:58.204 --> 30:59.379
I'm glad it did.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.208
- It was whoever.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.386
He changed his
mind, so here I am.

31:07.953 --> 31:08.997
- Enough said.

31:10.346 --> 31:12.522
- Now I can't even
imagine not being here.

31:18.137 --> 31:19.747
- For their retirement party.

31:20.617 --> 31:21.401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:24.317 --> 31:26.580
- The place is better than
I could have imagined.

31:26.623 --> 31:28.582
And the food is
going to be amazing.

31:28.625 --> 31:29.713
- Yep. Will be.

31:30.497 --> 31:32.020
Everything will be.

31:35.458 --> 31:36.982
- So.

31:37.025 --> 31:38.331
- So.

31:38.374 --> 31:39.723
- I'll send out the
invitations tonight.

31:39.767 --> 31:40.942
- Okay.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.335
- Give the final
selections to catering

31:42.378 --> 31:45.381
and that just leaves
decorations and dessert.

31:47.296 --> 31:50.256
- How long does it take to
build one gingerbread house?

31:51.605 --> 31:53.476
- There's no way I
can make and decorate

31:53.520 --> 31:55.435
that many gingerbread
houses in time.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.917
- What if you make one big one?

31:58.960 --> 32:00.919
- I'm not making a
silly skyscraper.

32:03.008 --> 32:06.968
- All right, how about you
order a bunch of pre-made ones

32:07.012 --> 32:08.665
and decorate those?

32:08.709 --> 32:10.276
They'll look just like yours.

32:10.319 --> 32:12.104
- They won't taste the same.

32:12.147 --> 32:13.932
- Everyone just eats
the decorations anyway.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.240
- Okay.

32:18.284 --> 32:19.938
- Okay. I'll take care of it.

32:21.504 --> 32:23.115
Don't worry. It's gonna be fine.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.945
- It can't be fine.
It has to be perfect.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.440
- And what do you
think about this one?

32:44.484 --> 32:45.920
- It's too small.

32:45.964 --> 32:46.834
It's not big enough.

32:46.877 --> 32:48.967
I want a statement piece.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.491
- A statement piece?

32:52.709 --> 32:54.146
You're really going all out.

32:55.190 --> 32:55.974
- They deserve it.

32:57.018 --> 32:57.801
- Okay.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.241
But why is the guy that's
buying your parents' place

33:02.284 --> 33:03.982
helping you with the party?

33:05.287 --> 33:08.160
- Because there wouldn't be a
party if it weren't for him.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.991
- Are you sure there's not
something in it for him?

33:14.166 --> 33:15.689
- He's just being nice.

33:17.604 --> 33:20.694
- Maybe he likes
spending time with you?

33:22.174 --> 33:24.176
- I don't think that's it.

33:24.219 --> 33:25.742
We're just friends.

33:25.786 --> 33:26.874
Not really friends.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.181
We're friendly.

33:30.399 --> 33:32.184
Besides he already
has a girlfriend.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.188
- Is that what he
told you over dinner?

33:37.319 --> 33:39.017
- It was a food tasting.

33:41.062 --> 33:41.889
- Did you talk?

33:44.935 --> 33:46.328
And laugh?

33:47.503 --> 33:49.027
- Maybe once.

33:50.158 --> 33:52.030
- Some would call that a date.

33:54.075 --> 33:56.556
Or if you have a
girlfriend, a food tasting.

33:57.470 --> 33:59.124
- It's not my fault.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.082
My dad asked me to train him.

34:01.126 --> 34:06.044
The lady doth
protest too much, methinks.

34:10.570 --> 34:11.397
That's the one!

34:13.094 --> 34:15.053
- Oh, that's definitely
not going in my car.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.409
He's pretty nice.

34:24.845 --> 34:29.023
But you should ask him who that
girl was in the coffee shop.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.633
Okay.

34:30.677 --> 34:33.288
- We have hot chocolate and
cookies over by the fire pit.

34:33.332 --> 34:34.594
- Great. Thank you.

34:36.204 --> 34:38.206
- I gotta go.

34:39.990 --> 34:41.079
But you guys have fun.

34:43.603 --> 34:44.386
Bye.
- Bye.

34:46.997 --> 34:49.957
- Well, I could go for
a cookie. How about you?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.524
- You're always hungry.

34:51.567 --> 34:52.612
That's true.

35:00.924 --> 35:01.925
- Here you go.

35:01.969 --> 35:03.231
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

35:06.278 --> 35:08.018
Think that's a snowman.

35:12.849 --> 35:13.633
Oh.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.468
- Sorry to bother you again.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.122
- Oh, no.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.862
Know how many times I get called

35:25.906 --> 35:28.561
for emergency
Christmas tree picking?

35:28.604 --> 35:30.650
- Not too often, I hope?

35:30.693 --> 35:31.999
- Never, actually.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.961
- Can ask you a question?

35:38.701 --> 35:39.485
- Shoot.

35:41.574 --> 35:43.489
- Why are you helping
me with the party?

35:45.665 --> 35:47.057
- I don't know.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.494
Same reason you're helping me.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.497
- Did my dad ask you to?

35:51.540 --> 35:52.498
- No. No.

35:52.541 --> 35:53.325
I mean,

35:54.935 --> 35:59.766
it's nice, you being willing
to spend your time with me.

35:59.809 --> 36:01.463
It's the least I can do.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.770
- Exactly.

36:03.813 --> 36:06.033
And you're a nice guy.
That's what I told Taylor.

36:07.426 --> 36:09.210
- You talked about me?

36:09.254 --> 36:14.172
Not really.
That's all right.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.044
- She's questioning
my intentions?

36:18.828 --> 36:21.004
- I told her you already
had a girlfriend.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.485
- Why would you say that?

36:24.269 --> 36:25.487
- I assumed.

36:26.401 --> 36:29.317
- Ah. You know what they say?

36:30.275 --> 36:31.537
- I thought there
must be someone

36:31.580 --> 36:33.495
you always leave
at the same time.

36:35.410 --> 36:36.368
- Impressive.

36:37.760 --> 36:39.458
You moonlight as a detective?

36:43.418 --> 36:44.376
Okay.

36:46.334 --> 36:51.383
So I leave to go pick
up Francie, my daughter.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.735
- He's a cutie. You never
mentioned her or your wife.

36:57.693 --> 37:02.394
- My wife, Laura, she died
a little over a year ago.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.224
- Alex, I'm so sorry.

37:07.964 --> 37:11.925
- That's why I don't mention
it to anybody right away.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.059
People always feel sorry for me

37:16.103 --> 37:17.713
and start treating
me differently.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.629
- I would have been nicer.

37:20.673 --> 37:22.849
- Well, it's not
exactly an easy thing

37:22.892 --> 37:24.372
to just come out and say.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.115
- I shouldn't have
brought it up.

37:29.072 --> 37:30.552
- No, I'm glad you did.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.994
You two have
your picture taken yet?

37:38.038 --> 37:39.605
- No, that's okay.
- Yeah.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.781
- Oh, you should. You
two are cute together.

37:43.522 --> 37:44.784
- I guess, it's picture time.

37:44.827 --> 37:45.741
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:46.568 --> 37:47.613
You convinced.

37:48.788 --> 37:49.615
- Get in close.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.363
- Okay.
- There you go.

37:58.406 --> 37:59.277
- Let's see.

38:00.365 --> 38:01.453
- I like it.

38:02.323 --> 38:03.150
- That's not bad.

38:05.587 --> 38:10.636
So you tell Taylor that
the reason I'm helping you

38:12.290 --> 38:14.466
is because I like
spending time with you.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.164
- Okay.

38:19.471 --> 38:21.473
- And that I'm a nice guy.

38:21.516 --> 38:22.474
Got it.

38:22.517 --> 38:23.649
- Don't forget that though.

38:23.692 --> 38:25.259
Right.

38:44.670 --> 38:45.801
Hey.

38:45.845 --> 38:46.672
- Hey.

38:52.155 --> 38:53.679
You look nice.

38:53.722 --> 38:54.506
- Thanks.

38:57.422 --> 38:58.858
Last night was fun.

38:58.901 --> 38:59.511
- Yeah, it was.

39:02.078 --> 39:05.168
We start making
hard mold chocolates in summer.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.606
- Why so early?

39:07.649 --> 39:10.391
- We get busy in the fall with
Halloween and Thanksgiving.

39:10.435 --> 39:11.566
Then we have a small break

39:11.610 --> 39:14.264
and go into Valentine's
Day and Easter.

39:14.308 --> 39:16.919
- So you were
ahead? That's smart.

39:16.963 --> 39:18.399
- And we always decorate early

39:18.443 --> 39:20.488
because if we don't,
we won't have time.

39:20.532 --> 39:21.359
- Makes sense.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.230
- You have your tree up?

39:23.273 --> 39:24.362
- Yeah, the tree.

39:25.624 --> 39:28.366
Does it count if it's
less than a foot?

39:28.409 --> 39:31.543
- A foot? That's not
a tree, that's a twig.

39:31.586 --> 39:32.370
- Yeah.

39:33.545 --> 39:34.763
- You haven't
decorated it have you?

39:34.807 --> 39:36.896
- No. Heavens, no.

39:38.288 --> 39:40.378
I wouldn't know where
to begin, honestly.

39:41.466 --> 39:44.251
- I could help, if you want?

39:45.470 --> 39:46.819
- Yeah.

39:46.862 --> 39:49.212
Yeah, I mean, I'll take
all the help I can get.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.398
- Think we have
everything we need.

40:00.441 --> 40:01.964
- Oh! I hope so.

40:02.008 --> 40:03.444
Francie's gonna love it.

40:03.488 --> 40:04.314
- She is.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.405
- You know, I don't
think I've successfully

40:07.448 --> 40:09.102
decorated a tree before.

40:09.145 --> 40:10.190
- Really?

40:10.233 --> 40:11.234
Yeah. Like successful.

40:11.278 --> 40:12.584
Surely you have?

40:18.633 --> 40:19.939
- Look, Daddy.

40:19.982 --> 40:22.811
Why is yours
so much better than mine?

40:22.855 --> 40:24.596
- Sadie showed me.

40:25.771 --> 40:28.687
- Are you sure you
haven't done this before?

40:28.730 --> 40:30.471
- Nope.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.734
- Well, you come
in natural talent.

40:32.778 --> 40:35.171
- What about me? Do I
have natural talent?

40:35.215 --> 40:36.129
- It's questionable.

40:37.043 --> 40:38.044
You'll get there.

40:38.087 --> 40:38.871
- Thank you.

40:39.741 --> 40:41.439
- Oh, I love this one.

40:43.092 --> 40:47.009
Do you have a favorite?

40:47.053 --> 40:49.185
- This one.
- Oh, wow.

40:49.229 --> 40:50.448
Is that your hand?

40:50.491 --> 40:52.711
- Mm-hmm.

40:52.754 --> 40:53.799
- I like this one too.

40:56.236 --> 40:59.805
Can she
come to my pageant?

40:59.848 --> 41:01.720
- So Francie wants to know

41:01.763 --> 41:04.462
if you'll come to her
Christmas pageant at church?

41:05.593 --> 41:07.334
- Yes. I would love to.

41:07.377 --> 41:09.510
You tell her
what you're gonna be.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.556
- An angel with the crown.

41:11.599 --> 41:12.600
- With a halo.

41:12.644 --> 41:13.862
I can't wait.

41:13.906 --> 41:14.863
- Uh-oh.

41:15.995 --> 41:16.952
- What?
- Seems to be a problem

41:16.996 --> 41:18.345
with these ornaments.

41:20.347 --> 41:23.002
They keep disappearing!

41:23.045 --> 41:24.220
How?

41:24.264 --> 41:26.484
- Don't eat them, Daddy.

41:26.527 --> 41:28.181
Don't eat them?

41:31.140 --> 41:33.012
- That one.
- This one right here?

41:33.055 --> 41:35.144
Okay. Good choice.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.668
What else looks yummy to you?

41:38.060 --> 41:39.322
That one.

41:39.366 --> 41:43.152
- Oh, this is one of
my favorites.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.286
There you go.

41:46.329 --> 41:48.506
And remember we have
candy-making demonstrations

41:48.549 --> 41:51.247
every Saturday at 10
o'clock right over there.

41:51.291 --> 41:52.118
- Thank you.

41:52.161 --> 41:53.075
- Absolutely.
- Bye.

41:53.119 --> 41:53.859
Bye-bye.

41:55.730 --> 41:58.080
Don't forget to
keep your inventory turning.

41:58.124 --> 41:59.691
- Right, yeah. Got it.

42:01.475 --> 42:04.130
- You know what? It
will all come in time.

42:04.173 --> 42:05.697
I've been doing
this my whole life.

42:05.740 --> 42:07.568
- Yeah, maybe that's
why I feel like

42:07.612 --> 42:08.874
such a klutz around you.

42:11.224 --> 42:13.226
- Why are you doing this?

42:13.269 --> 42:14.401
Why Annedore's?

42:15.707 --> 42:18.797
- Well, when I was
about Francie's age,

42:18.840 --> 42:20.233
I would stand outside the window

42:20.276 --> 42:23.105
to the candy store
that was by our house

42:23.149 --> 42:26.456
and just watch them
make fudge for hours.

42:26.500 --> 42:29.590
And I thought that's something
that I wanna do one day.

42:29.634 --> 42:32.724
You know? I wanna do something
that makes people happy.

42:34.116 --> 42:35.640
- I get that.

42:35.683 --> 42:38.425
Then when I got out of
college, I got a sales job.

42:38.468 --> 42:39.600
I traveled a lot.

42:40.427 --> 42:41.602
So when I became a single dad,

42:41.646 --> 42:43.909
I needed something
close to home.

42:44.953 --> 42:46.694
So I can be there for
Francie's activities.

42:46.738 --> 42:48.261
Pick her up from school.

42:48.304 --> 42:51.046
You know, if she's sick, or
bring her to work if I have to.

42:51.090 --> 42:54.789
- That was my childhood
and I absolutely loved it.

42:54.833 --> 42:55.964
They could hardly
keep me in school

42:56.008 --> 42:57.444
because I wanted to be here.

42:58.663 --> 43:00.534
- So why aren't you
doing this instead of me?

43:02.101 --> 43:03.624
- You'll laugh.

43:03.668 --> 43:04.582
- Promise. I won't.

43:06.671 --> 43:08.150
- My freshman year of college,

43:08.194 --> 43:11.327
I entered a gingerbread
house competition.

43:11.371 --> 43:12.764
- Thought you hated those?

43:14.026 --> 43:15.505
- I didn't win.

43:15.549 --> 43:16.463
So?

43:17.899 --> 43:20.728
- I thought it was perfect,
but the judges didn't.

43:20.772 --> 43:22.861
So I quit.

43:22.904 --> 43:24.776
Changed my major to marketing.

43:24.819 --> 43:27.605
- You changed your major
over what some judges said?

43:29.432 --> 43:32.174
- It wasn't perfect.
I know that now.

43:32.218 --> 43:33.436
- So what? No one's perfect.

43:33.480 --> 43:34.916
They can't be.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.483
You just have to do your best.

43:36.526 --> 43:38.746
- Customers don't
want to buy your best.

43:38.790 --> 43:41.183
- Yeah, well, they
also won't buy anything

43:41.227 --> 43:42.968
if they don't come
through the door.

43:43.708 --> 43:45.579
- What?

43:45.623 --> 43:46.319
- Follow me.

43:58.723 --> 44:00.463
They don't
even sell chocolate.

44:00.507 --> 44:01.769
- No.

44:01.813 --> 44:03.641
But they're giving
out hot spiced cider

44:03.684 --> 44:06.339
and they have all
sorts of gifts to sell.

44:06.382 --> 44:08.036
You're handing them
your customers.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.472
- You mean your customers?

44:09.516 --> 44:10.909
- Not until January 1st.

44:12.345 --> 44:14.652
Christmas is a big part of
your revenue for the year.

44:17.872 --> 44:19.178
- How do we get them back?

44:20.483 --> 44:22.268
- Well, you're the
one in marketing,

44:22.311 --> 44:25.358
but could hand out samples.

44:26.794 --> 44:28.013
What was it you said?

44:28.056 --> 44:31.799
There's chocolate, but
then there's Annedore's.

44:31.843 --> 44:33.801
Annedore's is a special.

44:33.845 --> 44:36.325
- You can taste
it in every bite.

44:36.369 --> 44:38.763
- And you need them to taste it.

44:38.806 --> 44:40.808
- But before we can
give them a sample,

44:40.852 --> 44:42.723
we have to get their attention.

44:42.767 --> 44:46.988
- Keep them moving from
their doorway to ours.

44:47.032 --> 44:47.859
Hm!

44:52.951 --> 44:56.781
I'll check
my list twice.

44:56.824 --> 44:58.434
- She's gone rogue.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.919
It's a gorgeous eve.

45:04.963 --> 45:07.748
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

45:07.792 --> 45:10.751
Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho!

45:10.795 --> 45:11.752
- Hey, guys.
- Merry Christmas!

45:11.796 --> 45:13.145
- Hi!
- Thank you so much.

45:14.102 --> 45:15.277
- We've been here so long,

45:15.321 --> 45:17.323
I just assumed
everyone knew about us.

45:17.366 --> 45:19.804
I forgot about marketing.

45:19.847 --> 45:21.501
- Sometimes it takes
a fresh set of eyes

45:21.544 --> 45:23.721
to really see what's
in front of you.

45:29.988 --> 45:31.511
- I'm not sure who
did all of this.

45:31.554 --> 45:33.731
- Oh, definitely...

45:33.774 --> 45:35.733
- Well, you make a good team.

45:35.776 --> 45:36.951
This is great.

45:36.995 --> 45:37.909
- Glad you like it.

45:39.345 --> 45:40.389
- Thanks.

45:40.433 --> 45:42.217
- Of course, Dad
- Ho, ho, ho!

45:42.261 --> 45:44.002
Merry Christmas!

45:44.045 --> 45:45.786
You been good this year?

45:45.830 --> 45:47.919
What you want for
Christmas, Francie?

45:57.580 --> 46:00.279
- All right, we look
good. You ready?

46:02.063 --> 46:03.064
One take.
- That's cute.

46:03.108 --> 46:04.196
Only take one.
- That's cute.

46:04.239 --> 46:05.850
- That's all we need.

46:05.893 --> 46:06.720
Look at her.

46:07.852 --> 46:09.288
Go ahead, pet him, Francie.

46:11.116 --> 46:12.639
Oh, and she loves it.

46:16.121 --> 46:17.122
- It's cute.

46:34.313 --> 46:36.837
boughs of holly

46:45.106 --> 46:47.500
It's
gonna look amazing.

46:47.543 --> 46:48.588
- I don't know what
I would've done

46:48.631 --> 46:50.895
if Alex hadn't found this place.

46:50.938 --> 46:52.287
- Sounds like the Scrooge

46:52.331 --> 46:54.507
isn't so bad to have
around after all.

46:55.987 --> 46:58.685
- He's different than the
guys I've dated before.

47:00.078 --> 47:04.343
He's responsible and he doesn't
get so absorbed in his work

47:04.386 --> 47:06.345
that he doesn't think
about anyone else.

47:07.476 --> 47:09.174
And he makes me laugh.

47:10.479 --> 47:12.177
- That's what I
want for Christmas.

47:14.222 --> 47:17.051
- I haven't told
anyone else this,

47:17.095 --> 47:20.011
but I might not wanna go back.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.275
Need some help?

47:23.318 --> 47:25.407
- Hey, when did you get here?

47:25.451 --> 47:26.756
- Just now.

47:26.800 --> 47:28.367
- Good. I'm glad you're here.

47:29.585 --> 47:31.022
- Well, I hope you
still feel that way

47:31.065 --> 47:33.372
after what I'm
about to tell you.

47:33.415 --> 47:34.199
- Okay?

47:35.853 --> 47:37.376
- You know the gingerbread
houses I ordered

47:37.419 --> 47:39.160
to save you time?

47:39.204 --> 47:40.335
- Are they here?

47:40.379 --> 47:43.948
- No. We hit a small snag.

47:43.991 --> 47:45.732
How small?

47:45.775 --> 47:47.865
- Well, there's
a large snowstorm

47:47.908 --> 47:49.954
covering the southern
part of the country.

47:50.911 --> 47:52.391
- Okay. So?

47:52.434 --> 47:55.829
- So the truck that
your houses are on,

47:55.873 --> 47:58.136
they're stuck somewhere.

47:58.179 --> 47:59.964
- When will they be here?

48:00.007 --> 48:02.053
- Best case scenario,
Christmas Eve.

48:02.096 --> 48:04.751
- And worse case?

48:04.794 --> 48:06.057
- Around the 26th.

48:07.493 --> 48:09.103
- Your best case
doesn't even work.

48:09.147 --> 48:12.541
I can't decorate 100 gingerbread
houses in less than a day.

48:12.585 --> 48:13.716
- I know. I know.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.066
That's why I'm gonna help.

48:15.109 --> 48:16.806
So will Taylor.

48:16.850 --> 48:19.418
- No, I need an assembly
line of 20 people.

48:19.461 --> 48:21.072
- Okay.

48:21.115 --> 48:25.076
So we think of something
new, something even better.

48:25.119 --> 48:26.816
- That's not how it works.

48:26.860 --> 48:29.080
I have to plan and shop.

48:29.123 --> 48:30.995
It's a process.

48:31.038 --> 48:34.172
- Well, you have a store
full of chocolate already.

48:34.215 --> 48:37.827
- It can't be what we do every
day. It has to be special.

48:37.871 --> 48:39.351
- Hey, look, I've got this.

48:39.394 --> 48:41.179
You go figure out what to do.

48:41.222 --> 48:42.571
- Thank you.

48:42.615 --> 48:43.964
- Yeah, and don't
worry about it.

48:44.008 --> 48:46.140
It'll be amazing
whatever happens.

48:46.184 --> 48:47.185
- How do you know?

48:47.228 --> 48:49.100
Because I know you.

48:50.188 --> 48:51.102
- Thanks, Taylor.

48:52.799 --> 48:54.235
- Thank you.
- Okay.

48:54.279 --> 48:58.109
I have two days to think
of an idea and execute it.

48:58.152 --> 49:01.808
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I messed up.

49:01.851 --> 49:04.028
- It's not your fault.
It's a snowstorm.

49:04.071 --> 49:06.160
- Well, yeah, if I weren't
trying to cut corners

49:06.204 --> 49:07.596
and make things easy on you.

49:07.640 --> 49:11.252
- You know? I can't talk
about this right now.

49:11.296 --> 49:12.906
I have to get back to the shop.

49:12.950 --> 49:13.994
- I'll go with you.

49:14.038 --> 49:15.561
- No, that's okay.

49:15.604 --> 49:16.562
I need to think.

49:16.605 --> 49:18.433
- Well, at least let me drive.

49:18.477 --> 49:19.304
- I have my car.

49:20.609 --> 49:24.396
- Okay. I'll walk
you out.

49:34.797 --> 49:35.973
What can I do?

49:36.016 --> 49:37.539
- I think we've
covered all the basics

49:37.583 --> 49:40.064
and I'm sure you'll outsource
a lot of products anyway.

49:41.108 --> 49:42.414
- I said I was sorry.

49:42.457 --> 49:45.156
- It's fine. I'm just
really behind now.

49:45.199 --> 49:46.461
- So let me help.

49:46.505 --> 49:47.767
- That's okay.

49:47.810 --> 49:48.681
Why don't you take
the morning off

49:48.724 --> 49:49.638
and spend it with Francie?

49:49.682 --> 49:50.988
I'm sure she'd love that.

49:54.339 --> 49:55.079
- Okay.

50:05.219 --> 50:07.004
- Why couldn't Sadie come?

50:07.047 --> 50:08.005
- She's working.

50:09.441 --> 50:10.181
- Why?

50:11.573 --> 50:14.707
Because Daddy
made a mess of things.

50:14.750 --> 50:17.840
- And Sadie has to clean it up?

50:17.884 --> 50:19.799
- Yeah, looks like it.

50:19.842 --> 50:21.496
- We could go help her.

50:23.933 --> 50:26.023
- I think she a little
space right now.

50:28.242 --> 50:29.722
- Can we buy her a present?

50:31.680 --> 50:33.900
- Yes, we can.
That's a great idea.

50:33.943 --> 50:35.075
Do you wanna pick it out?

50:35.119 --> 50:36.511
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

50:36.555 --> 50:38.383
What do you think about this?

50:38.426 --> 50:39.819
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

50:45.129 --> 50:47.392
Hey, wanna give her some money?

50:48.784 --> 50:49.916
Here.

50:49.959 --> 50:51.657
Now put it right in the bucket.

50:52.875 --> 50:53.876
Merry Christmas.

50:54.747 --> 50:55.922
Nice work, bud.

50:55.965 --> 50:57.010
Good work.

50:57.967 --> 50:59.099
Come on. Let's go do it.

50:59.143 --> 51:01.275
I think she's gonna
love these gifts.

51:01.319 --> 51:05.366
true love gave to me

51:05.410 --> 51:09.109
three french hens

51:09.153 --> 51:14.158
partridge in a pear tree

51:15.637 --> 51:20.599
my true love gave to me

51:25.952 --> 51:30.609
three french hens

51:32.654 --> 51:34.178
- We bought you lunch.

51:34.221 --> 51:35.135
- You did?
- Promise,

51:35.179 --> 51:36.702
we're not here to interrupt,

51:36.745 --> 51:39.096
just thought you might
be getting hungry.

51:39.139 --> 51:40.836
- Did you clean up your mess?

51:40.880 --> 51:41.837
What mess?

51:41.881 --> 51:43.752
- The one Daddy made.

51:43.796 --> 51:44.971
- Oh, that mess?

51:45.014 --> 51:47.060
No, I'm still working on it.

51:47.104 --> 51:49.062
- Hey, Francie, why
don't you go find Sherry

51:49.106 --> 51:51.673
and she can help you pick out
a couple of treats, all right?

51:51.717 --> 51:52.674
- Two?

51:52.718 --> 51:54.633
- One for now. One for later.

51:54.676 --> 51:55.808
Okay? But no more.

51:56.896 --> 51:57.766
- Thanks for the food.

51:57.810 --> 52:00.291
- It's the least I can do.

52:00.334 --> 52:01.814
- I don't blame
you. I really don't.

52:01.857 --> 52:04.164
But this is something
I need to do by myself.

52:04.208 --> 52:05.774
- Yeah. I get that.

52:07.646 --> 52:09.691
You're making turtles
for the party?

52:09.735 --> 52:10.779
- No, we're just low.

52:10.823 --> 52:12.129
So I thought I'd get that done

52:12.172 --> 52:13.608
before I start on the dessert.

52:14.827 --> 52:17.177
- Why don't I do this,
stay out of your hair,

52:17.221 --> 52:19.788
and you can focus
on the dessert?

52:19.832 --> 52:22.704
- You think you're ready
to do turtles by yourself?

52:22.748 --> 52:23.488
- I'm ready.

52:24.837 --> 52:25.664
- Fine.

52:26.578 --> 52:29.189
- I got two cookies!

52:29.233 --> 52:31.191
- Baby, those are actually-

52:31.235 --> 52:33.150
- You want me to show
you how to make them?

52:33.193 --> 52:34.325
Okay.

52:37.241 --> 52:39.025
My daddy showed me
how to make macaroons

52:39.068 --> 52:40.592
when I was just about your age.

52:40.635 --> 52:41.506
- He did?

52:41.549 --> 52:43.725
- Uh-huh. Sitting right there.

52:43.769 --> 52:44.596
- Like me!

52:46.163 --> 52:49.035
- My job was to put the cream
filling on just like this.

52:49.078 --> 52:51.168
- I can do that.
- Okay.

52:52.256 --> 52:54.171
All right. Slowly.

52:55.563 --> 52:58.218
Do you know what my
favorite flavor was?

52:58.262 --> 52:59.219
- Pink.

52:59.263 --> 53:01.482
- How did you know that?

53:01.526 --> 53:05.573
- That's my favorite color.

53:05.617 --> 53:08.315
- Ah, voila!

53:08.359 --> 53:11.231
- Very nice.
- I learned for the best.

53:11.275 --> 53:13.233
- I don't know about that.

53:13.277 --> 53:15.670
Okay, put them together
just like I showed you.

53:15.714 --> 53:17.672
Slow and twist.

53:17.716 --> 53:19.021
- Hey, thank you for doing this.

53:19.065 --> 53:20.719
- This was a nice distraction.

53:22.286 --> 53:24.288
- I think they call it
procrastination, actually.

53:25.158 --> 53:27.247
- Is it that obvious?

53:27.291 --> 53:29.597
- Still don't know what
you're gonna do, huh?

53:29.641 --> 53:30.685
Not a clue.

53:31.947 --> 53:34.863
- Well, I find that
inspiration strikes

53:34.907 --> 53:36.561
when you least expect it.

53:36.604 --> 53:37.344
- I hope so.

53:38.476 --> 53:40.173
Do you wanna try one?

53:40.217 --> 53:41.000
Go on.

53:43.829 --> 53:44.569
- Ooh!

53:46.005 --> 53:47.224
Is that good?

53:47.267 --> 53:48.790
Yeah?

53:48.834 --> 53:50.575
All right, baby, it's
time tell Sadie bye, okay?

53:52.141 --> 53:54.100
- Maybe you should take a
few to share with your dad.

53:54.143 --> 53:57.103
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Like that idea.

53:57.146 --> 53:58.626
- What do you think? Three.

53:58.670 --> 53:59.975
Here's a good one.

54:00.019 --> 54:02.717
- That's very generous.

54:02.761 --> 54:04.502
- Okay. See you later.

54:04.545 --> 54:05.416
- Bye.

54:05.459 --> 54:07.200
I'll see you later.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.027
Bye.

54:10.290 --> 54:12.205
- Listen, I hate
to bring this up

54:13.162 --> 54:14.990
and don't feel obligated at all,

54:15.034 --> 54:17.254
but tonight is
Francie's pageant.

54:18.385 --> 54:21.214
- No, I know, it's
on my calendar.

54:21.258 --> 54:22.128
I'll be there.

54:22.171 --> 54:23.956
- You don't have to, honestly,

54:23.999 --> 54:25.262
I'll explain to her
that you're busy.

54:25.305 --> 54:27.264
It's okay. She'll understand.

54:27.307 --> 54:28.439
- That's okay.

54:28.482 --> 54:29.266
- You sure?

54:30.354 --> 54:31.703
All right.

54:31.746 --> 54:33.313
- Bye.

54:33.357 --> 54:34.140
- Good luck.

54:37.361 --> 54:40.233
- "And there were shepherds
living out in the fields nearby,

54:40.277 --> 54:43.018
"keeping watch over
their flocks at night,

54:43.062 --> 54:45.151
"an angel of the
Lord appeared to them

54:45.194 --> 54:47.196
"and the glory of the
Lord shone around them

54:47.240 --> 54:48.807
"and they were terrified."

54:52.550 --> 54:53.333
- You made it.

54:53.377 --> 54:54.987
- Wouldn't miss it.

54:55.030 --> 54:57.642
Besides, it's the
hottest seat in town.

54:57.685 --> 54:59.600
- Do not be afraid.

54:59.644 --> 55:01.036
I bring you great news

55:01.080 --> 55:03.169
that will cause great
joy for everyone.

55:03.212 --> 55:04.605
Today in the town of David,

55:04.649 --> 55:06.999
a Savior has been born to you.

55:07.042 --> 55:09.131
He is the Messiah. The Lord.

55:09.175 --> 55:11.003
This will be assigned to you.

55:11.046 --> 55:12.526
You will find a baby
wrapped in cloths

55:12.570 --> 55:14.180
and lying in a manger.

55:14.223 --> 55:16.965
Glory to
God in the highest.

55:17.009 --> 55:20.273
Peace on earth. Goodwill to men.

55:20.317 --> 55:21.492
- Let's go to Bethlehem

55:21.535 --> 55:22.884
and see this thing
that has happened,

55:22.928 --> 55:24.886
which the Lord
has told us about.

55:24.930 --> 55:26.235
- "So they hurried off

55:26.279 --> 55:28.020
"and found Mary and
Joseph and the baby,

55:28.063 --> 55:30.283
"who was lying in a manger."

55:30.327 --> 55:35.332
no crib for a bed

55:37.551 --> 55:42.513
lay down his sweet head

55:44.558 --> 55:49.650
look down where he lay

55:51.391 --> 55:56.222
asleep on the hay

56:10.236 --> 56:11.368
She was just
wonderful, wasn't she?

56:12.543 --> 56:13.848
- Chip off the old block.

56:14.936 --> 56:15.937
Come here you!

56:15.981 --> 56:18.897
Oh, I'm so proud of you!

56:18.940 --> 56:20.377
Good job, baby.

56:20.420 --> 56:21.378
You did so well.

56:21.421 --> 56:23.336
- Do you like my crown?

56:23.380 --> 56:24.903
- Yes, I love your crown.

56:24.946 --> 56:26.383
I'm thinking of getting one.

56:27.471 --> 56:29.777
- Oh, look at that.

56:29.821 --> 56:30.561
- How do I look?

56:31.388 --> 56:32.389
- Like an angel.

56:33.477 --> 56:35.392
- Are you coming to my house?

56:36.610 --> 56:38.264
- Well, baby,
Sadie has something

56:38.307 --> 56:41.267
really, really important
to work on tonight,

56:41.310 --> 56:43.487
but it was sweet of
her to come, wasn't it?

56:43.530 --> 56:45.097
- Yeah, it was.

56:45.140 --> 56:46.315
Thank you.

56:46.359 --> 56:47.882
- Of course.

56:47.926 --> 56:49.144
It was nice to meet you both.

56:49.188 --> 56:50.581
Oh, you too. Merry Christmas.
- You too.

56:50.624 --> 56:52.452
Hope we see you again soon.

56:52.496 --> 56:53.279
- Bye.
- Bye.

56:58.632 --> 57:01.418
- Aren't these cute.
Where'd you get these?

57:01.461 --> 57:04.159
- I made them. Look at this one.

57:04.203 --> 57:04.943
- Oh.

57:06.466 --> 57:08.468
- You're supposed to wait
till after Christmas,

57:08.512 --> 57:10.688
but Daddy keeps eating them.

57:10.731 --> 57:13.560
Could you
teach me to make some?

57:13.604 --> 57:14.518
- Sadie could.

57:15.823 --> 57:17.303
- Who wants peanut brittle?

57:18.609 --> 57:22.134
- I'll give it a try.
Thank you.

57:22.177 --> 57:24.310
Hmm! Did you make this?

57:24.353 --> 57:25.964
- No, you're surprised?

57:26.007 --> 57:26.921
- I know you're not official

57:26.965 --> 57:28.488
till after the 1st of the year,

57:28.532 --> 57:30.490
but I think we can get
some of this before then?

57:30.534 --> 57:31.622
- Oh, boy.

57:31.665 --> 57:33.667
My profit margin's
decreasing already.

57:34.842 --> 57:35.930
- A toast.

57:37.366 --> 57:40.500
To Francie, the most convincing
angel I've ever seen.

57:40.544 --> 57:42.502
To Francie.

57:42.546 --> 57:44.635
- Well done, baby.

57:44.678 --> 57:48.290
- Hmm! You should invite
Sadie over for Christmas.

57:48.334 --> 57:49.466
- Yay!

57:50.336 --> 57:51.468
- Sure.

57:52.556 --> 57:54.340
- That's something
to think about.

58:46.610 --> 58:47.828
Hi, Sadie.

58:47.872 --> 58:49.134
- Hey, Beth, how are you?

58:49.177 --> 58:51.136
- Good. What can I get you?

58:51.179 --> 58:53.486
- Oh, caffeine and sugar.

58:53.530 --> 58:54.835
- You got it.

58:54.879 --> 58:55.706
Anything else?

58:57.925 --> 58:59.100
- Only if you have something

58:59.144 --> 59:01.146
that can help me
come up with an idea.

59:01.189 --> 59:02.756
- I wish I did.

59:04.018 --> 59:06.412
- I think I'm trying so
hard, my mind is blank.

59:08.109 --> 59:11.243
- Same thing happens to me.
It's the pressure to create.

59:15.160 --> 59:17.597
I try to get my mind off of
what I'm trying to think about,

59:17.641 --> 59:18.946
and that's when it hits me.

59:18.990 --> 59:20.339
It's like it's so obvious.

59:20.382 --> 59:22.080
Like it's been there all along.

59:23.255 --> 59:24.909
- Okay.

59:24.952 --> 59:28.086
My mind is a clean slate.
I'm thinking about nothing.

59:30.305 --> 59:31.263
- Merry Christmas.

59:32.481 --> 59:34.875
Merry Christmas.

59:43.057 --> 59:43.928
There it is.

59:44.842 --> 59:46.104
Right in front of me.

59:47.496 --> 59:48.454
- What is?

59:51.283 --> 59:52.458
- You're a genius.

59:52.501 --> 59:53.154
I've gotta get to work.

59:53.198 --> 59:54.112
Thank you!

59:56.767 --> 59:58.072
- You're welcome.

1:01:32.950 --> 1:01:34.691
- I'm never gonna
get this all done.

1:01:44.309 --> 1:01:46.050
I could use some help after all.

1:01:48.008 --> 1:01:49.183
Okay.

1:01:49.227 --> 1:01:50.228
See you soon.

1:01:51.229 --> 1:01:52.056
Thanks.

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:56.060
I thought I could
get everything done,

1:01:56.103 --> 1:01:57.670
but the houses got
stuck in the snow,

1:01:57.714 --> 1:01:59.541
and there just
isn't enough time.

1:01:59.585 --> 1:02:01.587
- We're glad you called.

1:02:01.630 --> 1:02:02.240
- You are?

1:02:02.283 --> 1:02:04.068
- Yeah.

1:02:04.111 --> 1:02:06.723
It's nice to think you still
need us once in a while.

1:02:08.028 --> 1:02:10.291
- How many nights have
we spent right here?

1:02:10.335 --> 1:02:12.293
Valentine's Day and Easter,

1:02:12.337 --> 1:02:13.338
trying to make all the chocolate

1:02:13.381 --> 1:02:14.905
so we could fill all the orders.

1:02:14.948 --> 1:02:17.211
- We always got
them done didn't we?

1:02:17.255 --> 1:02:19.779
- Well, it's going to
take a miracle this time.

1:02:19.823 --> 1:02:22.216
- Even if you don't get
every last detail done,

1:02:22.260 --> 1:02:23.740
it's going to be great.

1:02:25.263 --> 1:02:27.700
- But I wanted everything
to be perfect for you.

1:02:27.744 --> 1:02:30.398
- Oh, sweetie. It already is.

1:02:32.313 --> 1:02:33.924
Why don't you take
a little break?

1:02:33.967 --> 1:02:34.838
We'll keep working.

1:02:34.881 --> 1:02:36.535
- I'm not leaving you guys here.

1:02:36.578 --> 1:02:38.363
- We can handle it.

1:02:38.406 --> 1:02:39.277
Go get something to eat.

1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.801
We'll be here when you get back.

1:02:41.845 --> 1:02:42.628
Go!

1:02:43.585 --> 1:02:44.586
- Okay. Okay.

1:02:59.427 --> 1:03:01.125
It finally came to me.

1:03:01.168 --> 1:03:01.952
You were right.

1:03:02.779 --> 1:03:03.954
What'd you say?

1:03:03.997 --> 1:03:06.304
I said
you were right.

1:03:45.299 --> 1:03:46.779
You didn't have to come.

1:03:46.823 --> 1:03:48.346
- Yeah, I did.

1:03:48.389 --> 1:03:50.217
I had to hear it in person.

1:03:50.261 --> 1:03:51.479
I'm not
saying it again.

1:03:51.523 --> 1:03:53.220
That's all
right, I recorded it.

1:03:53.264 --> 1:03:54.831
Play it back whenever I want.

1:03:57.834 --> 1:04:00.358
- Do you ever get
that hint of sadness

1:04:00.401 --> 1:04:02.012
right before Christmas?

1:04:02.055 --> 1:04:05.232
Because you know all the
anticipation is almost over?

1:04:05.276 --> 1:04:06.364
- I guess so. Yeah.

1:04:07.756 --> 1:04:09.193
- That's how I feel tonight.

1:04:10.237 --> 1:04:12.370
Excited with a hint of sad.

1:04:13.675 --> 1:04:15.416
Tomorrow's the party,
then Christmas,

1:04:15.460 --> 1:04:17.201
and you'll be the chocolatier.

1:04:19.116 --> 1:04:19.856
- Yeah.

1:04:22.815 --> 1:04:26.079
Honestly, I don't know how
I'm gonna do this without you.

1:04:26.123 --> 1:04:27.733
I'm not ready.

1:04:27.776 --> 1:04:29.039
Yes. You are.

1:04:30.257 --> 1:04:31.432
- Sweet of you to think so.

1:04:31.476 --> 1:04:34.392
But you both know I'm not.

1:04:36.655 --> 1:04:39.745
- You don't have to do
everything yourself, Alex.

1:04:39.788 --> 1:04:40.572
- Really?

1:04:42.139 --> 1:04:44.576
That's the case, why don't I
come back and help you tonight?

1:04:46.186 --> 1:04:50.364
- I would say, okay, but I
want it to be a surprise.

1:04:50.408 --> 1:04:51.235
Why?

1:04:52.845 --> 1:04:55.761
- You may have played a very
small part in my inspiration.

1:04:56.588 --> 1:04:57.371
I think you'll like it.

1:04:57.415 --> 1:04:59.199
- I played a part, huh?

1:05:01.071 --> 1:05:02.289
- If you hadn't talked me

1:05:02.333 --> 1:05:03.638
into ordering the
gingerbread houses,

1:05:03.682 --> 1:05:05.205
and they hadn't been delayed,

1:05:05.249 --> 1:05:07.991
I never would have been
forced to do something else.

1:05:08.034 --> 1:05:11.429
- So I make problems
and you solve them?

1:05:12.604 --> 1:05:15.172
Sounds like you're saying
we make a great team.

1:05:15.215 --> 1:05:17.522
- Is that what you heard?
- Mm-hmm.

1:05:19.393 --> 1:05:20.264
I wanted to thank you.

1:05:21.874 --> 1:05:24.224
Really made this a special
Christmas for Francie.

1:05:26.313 --> 1:05:27.619
- She's an easy kid to like.

1:05:28.663 --> 1:05:30.100
- And she really likes you.

1:05:32.929 --> 1:05:35.453
She's gonna miss
you after you leave.

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:37.934
- I'll miss her too.

1:05:40.327 --> 1:05:42.460
She may wanna
come visit sometime.

1:05:43.852 --> 1:05:44.636
- She should.

1:05:46.507 --> 1:05:48.335
- I would have to
be there, of course,

1:05:48.379 --> 1:05:50.642
she's too young
to fly by herself.

1:05:50.685 --> 1:05:53.993
- Of course, and
I'll come home too.

1:05:54.037 --> 1:05:55.821
To visit my parents.

1:05:58.476 --> 1:05:59.781
- I bet they'd like that.

1:06:01.740 --> 1:06:02.480
- I hope so.

1:06:09.095 --> 1:06:10.140
- I'm sorry.

1:06:11.402 --> 1:06:12.446
One second.

1:06:15.275 --> 1:06:17.234
I have to pick up Francie.

1:06:17.277 --> 1:06:18.496
- I need to get back too.

1:06:24.371 --> 1:06:25.764
Hi, you've reached
Sadie's phone.

1:06:25.807 --> 1:06:27.679
I'm not here right now,
so please leave a message.

1:06:27.722 --> 1:06:30.421
- Sadie, I was able to
get a flight after all.

1:06:30.464 --> 1:06:31.596
So I'll be home for Christmas.

1:06:31.639 --> 1:06:34.860
So I'll give you a
call when I get in.

1:06:34.903 --> 1:06:37.036
Maybe we could get together?

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:37.994
See ya.

1:06:54.575 --> 1:06:56.534
- Do you think she'll like it?

1:06:56.577 --> 1:06:57.665
- I think she'll love it.

1:06:58.753 --> 1:07:03.193
Okay. "To Sadie from
Francie and Alex."

1:07:06.935 --> 1:07:08.198
- You should write love.

1:07:09.590 --> 1:07:12.506
- And you should go get dressed.

1:07:12.550 --> 1:07:14.856
Go on. I'll finish this.

1:07:14.900 --> 1:07:16.380
Remember to brush your teeth.

1:07:16.423 --> 1:07:18.208
Okay.
- Okay.

1:07:29.654 --> 1:07:31.569
- Merry Christmas.
- Hey, Lisa. Come in.

1:07:31.612 --> 1:07:33.136
- Hey
- How are you?

1:07:33.179 --> 1:07:34.093
Good,
good. How are you?

1:07:34.137 --> 1:07:35.529
- Pretty decent. Pretty decent.

1:07:37.314 --> 1:07:39.403
- I can't stay, but
this is for Francie.

1:07:39.446 --> 1:07:41.535
- Oh, great. She's upstairs.

1:07:41.579 --> 1:07:44.538
We were just finishing
this gift for Sadie.

1:07:44.582 --> 1:07:46.758
- This tree looks amazing.
- Yeah.

1:07:46.801 --> 1:07:50.414
- You do this.
- Not entirely. Sadie helped.

1:07:50.457 --> 1:07:51.937
- Who's this Sadie?

1:07:51.980 --> 1:07:54.374
- Her parents own Annedore's,
the place I'm buying.

1:07:54.418 --> 1:07:56.594
- That was very nice of you
to buy their daughter a gift.

1:07:56.637 --> 1:07:59.988
- Well, that was
entirely Francie's idea.

1:08:00.032 --> 1:08:01.077
She really likes her.

1:08:02.556 --> 1:08:03.775
What?

1:08:03.818 --> 1:08:04.993
- Nothing.

1:08:05.037 --> 1:08:06.430
It's nice.

1:08:06.473 --> 1:08:08.867
- It's a business relationship.

1:08:08.910 --> 1:08:10.434
And she's been helping
me out at the shop,

1:08:10.477 --> 1:08:12.436
so I'm helping her

1:08:12.479 --> 1:08:14.612
with her parents' retirement
party, that's all.

1:08:14.655 --> 1:08:16.788
- You don't have to
explain anything to me.

1:08:16.831 --> 1:08:18.137
- We're just friends, Lisa.

1:08:18.181 --> 1:08:20.792
- Alex. It's okay.

1:08:21.706 --> 1:08:23.447
I want you to find somebody.

1:08:24.665 --> 1:08:26.537
And Laura would want
that for you too.

1:08:27.625 --> 1:08:29.757
Not just you, Francie
needs someone.

1:08:29.801 --> 1:08:30.802
She has you.

1:08:32.673 --> 1:08:33.892
- It's not really the same.

1:08:36.199 --> 1:08:38.114
- Well, it doesn't matter.

1:08:38.157 --> 1:08:40.290
She's only here for Christmas.

1:08:40.333 --> 1:08:42.640
- Well, have you told
her how you feel?

1:08:42.683 --> 1:08:45.164
- Not in the exact words.

1:08:45.208 --> 1:08:47.601
- Okay, so used the exact words.

1:08:49.734 --> 1:08:52.606
- What if she doesn't feel
the same? Then it's...

1:08:52.650 --> 1:08:55.566
- Oh, women do not
just come to your house

1:08:55.609 --> 1:08:58.134
and decorate your tree and
spend time with your child

1:08:58.177 --> 1:09:00.658
because they have a business
relationship with you.

1:09:02.703 --> 1:09:03.704
- They don't, huh?

1:09:03.748 --> 1:09:04.749
Don't think so.

1:09:38.826 --> 1:09:40.393
Hi, you've
reached Sadie's phone.

1:09:40.437 --> 1:09:42.526
I'm not here right now.
So please leave a message.

1:09:43.831 --> 1:09:45.093
- I'm not sure if
he got my message,

1:09:45.137 --> 1:09:48.096
but I'm back and thought
we could get together.

1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:49.707
Call me.

1:09:49.750 --> 1:09:52.492
- Did you know he plans on
outsourcing his peanut brittle?

1:09:52.536 --> 1:09:53.667
- No, I didn't know that.

1:09:54.799 --> 1:09:56.104
But it's not a bad idea,

1:09:56.148 --> 1:09:58.672
since we only make it
around the holidays.

1:09:58.716 --> 1:10:00.196
- But it's not just the brittle.

1:10:00.239 --> 1:10:02.067
He's going to change everything.

1:10:03.286 --> 1:10:05.375
- Well, it's going
to be his store.

1:10:05.418 --> 1:10:06.376
- Really?

1:10:06.419 --> 1:10:07.725
You don't care anymore?

1:10:09.117 --> 1:10:11.859
- I've cared for
over 40 years, Sadie.

1:10:11.903 --> 1:10:14.732
I've had my say,
now it's his turn.

1:10:16.299 --> 1:10:17.996
Alex can do whatever he wants.

1:10:30.617 --> 1:10:31.705
- I'll go talk to her.

1:10:42.150 --> 1:10:44.414
- Why am I the
only one who cares?

1:10:47.547 --> 1:10:49.941
- Is it really the brittle
that's got you so upset?

1:10:52.335 --> 1:10:53.858
- He has a girlfriend.

1:10:54.946 --> 1:10:56.643
I asked him if he did
and he said he didn't.

1:10:56.687 --> 1:10:58.297
Why would he do that?
- Are you sure?

1:10:58.341 --> 1:11:00.778
I mean, that doesn't
sound like him.

1:11:00.821 --> 1:11:03.128
- That's what I thought
too, but I was wrong.

1:11:04.564 --> 1:11:05.391
- Sorry.

1:11:06.523 --> 1:11:08.089
- Oh, I'm just so embarrassed.

1:11:08.133 --> 1:11:11.745
- Hey, ah, if anyone's
embarrassed, it should be Alex.

1:11:15.836 --> 1:11:18.012
It's an early Christmas gift.

1:11:18.056 --> 1:11:19.623
What is it?

1:11:19.666 --> 1:11:20.711
- Let's find out.

1:11:25.063 --> 1:11:27.761
I thought you might want
something new to wear tonight.

1:11:27.805 --> 1:11:30.460
- It's beautiful. Thanks, Mom.

1:11:30.503 --> 1:11:31.374
- Sure.

1:11:31.417 --> 1:11:32.636
It's more beautiful on you.

1:11:35.073 --> 1:11:37.075
- You look pretty, Daddy.

1:11:37.118 --> 1:11:38.468
- Pretty, huh?

1:11:38.511 --> 1:11:39.817
That's what I was going for.

1:11:40.687 --> 1:11:41.732
- And smell good too.

1:11:42.733 --> 1:11:44.300
- Thank you.

1:11:44.343 --> 1:11:45.649
Hey, remember Aunt Lisa's coming

1:11:45.692 --> 1:11:47.781
to get you ready for the party.

1:11:47.825 --> 1:11:49.305
Daddy has to do something first,

1:11:49.348 --> 1:11:50.741
but I'll meet you there, okay?

1:11:50.784 --> 1:11:51.481
- Okay.

1:11:53.352 --> 1:11:58.314
bells, jingle all the way

1:11:58.357 --> 1:12:02.405
in a one horse open sleigh

1:12:02.448 --> 1:12:09.499
- Hey!

1:12:10.717 --> 1:12:12.110
Hi, you've
reached Sadie's phone.

1:12:12.153 --> 1:12:14.721
I'm not here right now.
So please leave a message.

1:12:14.765 --> 1:12:18.203
- So I don't know if you
got my earlier message,

1:12:18.246 --> 1:12:19.683
but I came back to see you.

1:12:21.249 --> 1:12:22.816
What are you doing
for Christmas?

1:12:39.485 --> 1:12:40.573
You're probably busy.

1:12:40.617 --> 1:12:43.184
So just thought, I'd say

1:12:45.883 --> 1:12:47.232
Merry Christmas, Sadie.

1:13:12.213 --> 1:13:14.172
- What are you doing here?

1:13:14.215 --> 1:13:16.392
- I've been wanting
to talk to you.

1:13:16.435 --> 1:13:17.871
- Now's not a good time.

1:13:17.915 --> 1:13:20.047
- Please, it's important.

1:13:21.353 --> 1:13:22.920
I'm afraid if I don't
tell you this now,

1:13:22.963 --> 1:13:24.878
then it's gonna be too late.

1:13:24.922 --> 1:13:26.445
- I already know what
you're going to say.

1:13:26.489 --> 1:13:27.272
- Really?

1:13:28.491 --> 1:13:29.927
I don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

1:13:30.884 --> 1:13:32.451
- You don't have
to say anything.

1:13:32.495 --> 1:13:35.933
I just wish you would
have been honest with me.

1:13:35.976 --> 1:13:37.978
- I haven't been
dishonest with you.

1:13:39.284 --> 1:13:41.982
- I asked you if you had a
girlfriend and you said no.

1:13:42.026 --> 1:13:42.766
- I don't.

1:13:44.376 --> 1:13:46.378
- I saw you with her
at the coffee shop.

1:13:46.422 --> 1:13:47.945
The morning we met.

1:13:47.988 --> 1:13:50.730
- You mean the day you told
Taylor I was the Scrooge,

1:13:50.774 --> 1:13:52.253
and I was stealing Christmas?

1:13:53.516 --> 1:13:54.995
- You were listening
to my conversation?

1:13:55.039 --> 1:13:57.258
- Couldn't help it, you were
sitting right next to me.

1:13:57.302 --> 1:13:59.478
- Then you knew how I
felt about Annedore's.

1:13:59.522 --> 1:14:02.438
- If I had known you then I
wouldn't have bought the place.

1:14:04.483 --> 1:14:05.876
- That's just it.

1:14:05.919 --> 1:14:07.791
You couldn't have known.

1:14:07.834 --> 1:14:08.966
I didn't.

1:14:10.533 --> 1:14:11.316
- I'm sorry.

1:14:14.188 --> 1:14:15.146
- It's okay.

1:14:16.234 --> 1:14:17.496
It's yours.

1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:18.976
And I wish you all the luck.

1:14:21.718 --> 1:14:22.936
- She's my sister-in-law.

1:14:25.939 --> 1:14:27.724
- Your sister-in-law?

1:14:27.767 --> 1:14:29.508
- Hmm. Lisa.

1:14:29.552 --> 1:14:30.466
Laura's sister.

1:14:35.340 --> 1:14:36.994
- I've gotta get this
to the hotel, so.

1:14:37.037 --> 1:14:38.343
- Let me carry it.

1:14:39.866 --> 1:14:42.173
Please, let me drive. The
roads are getting slick.

1:14:42.216 --> 1:14:43.000
- Okay.

1:15:02.889 --> 1:15:05.805
- Did I tell you
I like your dress?

1:15:07.024 --> 1:15:08.504
- No, you didn't.

1:15:09.505 --> 1:15:10.201
- Well, I do.

1:15:11.289 --> 1:15:12.029
You look nice.

1:15:13.770 --> 1:15:14.901
- So do you.

1:15:14.945 --> 1:15:18.339
Thanks. Francie
picked up my tie.

1:15:19.123 --> 1:15:20.559
- Where is Francie?

1:15:20.603 --> 1:15:21.517
- She'll be there.

1:15:24.302 --> 1:15:27.044
- I hope people will still
come in this weather.

1:15:28.349 --> 1:15:30.787
- If they don't, you're gonna
have a lot of leftover food.

1:15:30.830 --> 1:15:32.528
- You're always
thinking about food.

1:15:34.747 --> 1:15:36.053
- Have a question.

1:15:37.794 --> 1:15:39.012
The first time we met,

1:15:40.666 --> 1:15:44.017
you acted like you
didn't recognize me.

1:15:45.584 --> 1:15:47.064
Why didn't you say anything?

1:15:49.196 --> 1:15:51.068
- I hoped you hadn't seen me.

1:15:53.331 --> 1:15:55.551
- Trust me. I saw you.

1:15:59.380 --> 1:16:04.255
And the reason I showed
up at Annedore's earlier,

1:16:05.299 --> 1:16:06.083
I wanted to...

1:16:07.301 --> 1:16:08.955
I wanted to...

1:16:08.999 --> 1:16:10.740
- Maybe talk about this later?

1:16:11.784 --> 1:16:13.438
I just wanna focus on the party.

1:16:15.658 --> 1:16:17.573
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1:16:35.068 --> 1:16:36.504
This is great.

1:16:36.548 --> 1:16:38.115
Isn't it?

1:16:38.942 --> 1:16:40.291
Oh, this place.

1:16:42.946 --> 1:16:44.600
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1:16:46.210 --> 1:16:47.254
Here's your receipt.

1:16:51.258 --> 1:16:53.217
- I think there's
been a mistake.

1:16:53.260 --> 1:16:54.653
I can't pay for this.

1:16:54.697 --> 1:16:56.133
- It's already been paid.

1:16:57.003 --> 1:16:58.222
- Thank you.

1:16:58.265 --> 1:16:59.136
- Oh, I got that.

1:16:59.179 --> 1:17:00.267
Thanks so much.

1:17:05.185 --> 1:17:06.317
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

1:17:07.710 --> 1:17:09.320
- Thank you.

1:17:09.363 --> 1:17:10.147
- Thanks.

1:17:11.627 --> 1:17:14.151
- I don't think your
Ebenezer, not even close.

1:17:15.587 --> 1:17:18.198
- That might be the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:24.117
- You're not at all who I
thought you were going to be.

1:17:24.161 --> 1:17:25.815
- So, why did I tell ya?

1:17:26.729 --> 1:17:30.123
- Wow. It looks incredible.

1:17:31.647 --> 1:17:32.473
- Yeah, it does.

1:17:33.779 --> 1:17:34.824
- I can't believe it.

1:17:35.738 --> 1:17:37.348
You did all of this for us?

1:17:37.391 --> 1:17:39.829
It's
absolutely beautiful.

1:17:39.872 --> 1:17:41.569
Well, it was all Sadie.

1:17:41.613 --> 1:17:43.267
- No, it wasn't.

1:17:43.310 --> 1:17:46.009
I couldn't have done any of it
if it weren't for all of you.

1:17:46.052 --> 1:17:47.706
Taylor helped me decorate,

1:17:47.750 --> 1:17:50.535
Alex found this amazing room,

1:17:50.578 --> 1:17:53.146
and Mom and Dad were
here to help me finish.

1:17:54.408 --> 1:17:55.540
I have a surprise.

1:18:01.851 --> 1:18:04.288
- Oh.
- Wow.

1:18:04.331 --> 1:18:05.855
Annedore's.

1:18:05.898 --> 1:18:07.291
It's brilliant.

1:18:07.334 --> 1:18:08.553
- It was your idea to do

1:18:08.596 --> 1:18:11.164
one big gingerbread
house all along.

1:18:11.208 --> 1:18:13.036
- I can't think
of anything better

1:18:13.079 --> 1:18:15.342
than making a gingerbread
house out of the place

1:18:15.386 --> 1:18:17.083
that brought us the most joy,

1:18:18.345 --> 1:18:21.218
and with the people that have
brought me even more joy.

1:18:22.698 --> 1:18:23.568
Shall we toast?

1:18:30.314 --> 1:18:35.232
To sweet
endings and new beginnings.

1:18:36.015 --> 1:18:36.886
For all of us.

1:18:38.975 --> 1:18:40.628
- Wait.

1:18:40.672 --> 1:18:41.542
Wait, sorry.

1:18:42.587 --> 1:18:44.371
I don't think I can do this.

1:18:45.633 --> 1:18:47.897
I mean, you guys have
such a wonderful business,

1:18:47.940 --> 1:18:50.551
but I'm not the
right person for it.

1:18:51.901 --> 1:18:53.206
Sadie is.

1:18:53.250 --> 1:18:57.080
Christopher.
Hey, congratulations.

1:18:58.342 --> 1:19:00.648
We must be getting
old now, you know?

1:19:00.692 --> 1:19:02.259
- You can't back out.

1:19:02.302 --> 1:19:05.044
- Sadie, this has been your
dream from the beginning.

1:19:06.219 --> 1:19:08.134
I'm not taking that from you.

1:19:08.178 --> 1:19:09.266
- What's going on?

1:19:10.789 --> 1:19:14.271
- Alex thinks that I want
Annedore's, so he's backing out.

1:19:14.314 --> 1:19:15.533
- What's wrong?

1:19:15.576 --> 1:19:17.143
- Alex thinks that
Sadie wants Annedore's,

1:19:17.187 --> 1:19:18.754
and that's why he's backing out.

1:19:20.103 --> 1:19:21.234
- Is this true?

1:19:21.278 --> 1:19:23.106
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
I told him not to.

1:19:24.324 --> 1:19:25.456
- It was always my dream

1:19:25.499 --> 1:19:27.284
that you would take
over Annedore's.

1:19:28.198 --> 1:19:29.982
I didn't think you wanted it.

1:19:30.026 --> 1:19:31.027
- Daddy-
- We just want you

1:19:31.070 --> 1:19:31.941
to be happy.

1:19:33.551 --> 1:19:34.291
- I am.

1:19:37.642 --> 1:19:38.904
I can't do this to you.

1:19:39.818 --> 1:19:41.733
- Yes, you can.

1:19:41.777 --> 1:19:44.344
I can find another business.

1:19:44.388 --> 1:19:47.652
One that needs to
change and grow.

1:19:47.695 --> 1:19:49.262
Not one that's already perfect.

1:19:50.350 --> 1:19:51.830
- We're not perfect.

1:19:51.874 --> 1:19:55.312
We need new equipment and
we could open a new location

1:19:55.355 --> 1:19:57.314
and expand our
existing product line.

1:19:58.358 --> 1:19:59.490
- Are we still retiring?

1:20:03.450 --> 1:20:04.625
- I'll need a partner.

1:20:05.757 --> 1:20:07.628
- I'm listening.

1:20:07.672 --> 1:20:09.369
- 50/50.

1:20:09.413 --> 1:20:12.329
I promise to listen to your
ideas if you listen to mine.

1:20:17.290 --> 1:20:18.465
- I love you.

1:20:20.206 --> 1:20:21.686
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1:20:22.818 --> 1:20:23.819
- I love you too.

1:20:31.609 --> 1:20:32.828
Is that a yes?

1:20:34.699 --> 1:20:36.396
- Sadie! Sadie!

1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:39.182
We got you something
from me and Daddy.

1:20:39.225 --> 1:20:40.139
- You did?

1:20:41.227 --> 1:20:42.446
- Sadie, this is Lisa.

1:20:42.489 --> 1:20:43.795
Lisa, Sadie.

1:20:43.839 --> 1:20:45.492
- Hi. It's very nice
to finally meet you.

1:20:45.536 --> 1:20:48.756
- I've heard a lot about
you from both of them.

1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:50.019
- Open it!

1:20:50.062 --> 1:20:50.846
- Okay.

1:20:51.847 --> 1:20:53.370
It's you and Daddy.

1:20:53.413 --> 1:20:55.894
She picked
it out herself.

1:20:55.938 --> 1:20:56.721
- Thank you.

1:20:58.288 --> 1:21:03.162
let nothing you dismay

1:21:03.206 --> 1:21:07.471
was born on Christmas Day

1:21:07.514 --> 1:21:10.082
from Satan's power

1:21:12.258 --> 1:21:15.653
comfort and joy

1:21:17.002 --> 1:21:21.920
comfort and joy

1:21:21.964 --> 1:21:26.925
the blessed angels came

1:21:31.234 --> 1:21:33.932
- Can I get
everybody's attention?

1:21:33.976 --> 1:21:35.586
Tonight is special,

1:21:36.935 --> 1:21:38.589
and not just because
it's Christmas Eve,

1:21:39.982 --> 1:21:42.941
but because we're surrounded
by all our friends.

1:21:42.985 --> 1:21:45.074
We got quite a surprise tonight.

1:21:46.423 --> 1:21:48.033
Not only are we retiring,

1:21:49.382 --> 1:21:53.125
but our dear Sadie is coming
home to run Annedore's

1:21:53.169 --> 1:21:55.432
with her new business
partner, Alex Mitchell.

1:21:56.737 --> 1:22:01.438
Alex, Francie, welcome
to the Annedore family.

1:22:03.527 --> 1:22:07.400
And Sadie, welcome home.

1:22:07.444 --> 1:22:08.924
We couldn't be happier.

1:22:11.361 --> 1:22:14.016
Do you hear?

1:22:14.059 --> 1:22:16.975
- Baby, let me
hold you.

1:22:17.019 --> 1:22:18.107
- Ho, ho, ho!

1:22:19.369 --> 1:22:20.544
Merry Christmas.

1:22:20.587 --> 1:22:22.807
Have you been a good
girl this year, Francie?

1:22:23.808 --> 1:22:25.462
What do you want for Christmas?

1:22:26.550 --> 1:22:28.769
- I already have it.

1:22:28.813 --> 1:22:30.510
merry Christmas

1:22:30.554 --> 1:22:32.469
merry Christmas

1:22:32.512 --> 1:22:35.951
and a happy new year

1:22:35.994 --> 1:22:39.824
wherever you are

1:22:39.867 --> 1:22:43.436
and a happy new year

1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:45.134
merry Christmas

1:22:45.177 --> 1:22:47.049
merry Christmas

1:22:47.092 --> 1:22:50.487
and a happy new year

1:22:50.530 --> 1:22:53.011
merry Christmas

1:22:53.055 --> 1:22:55.013
- When I was a little girl,

1:22:55.057 --> 1:22:57.798
I was sure that Annedore's
was a magical place.

1:22:57.842 --> 1:23:00.410
And if you look in the window...

1:23:00.453 --> 1:23:02.064
- That's me.

1:23:02.107 --> 1:23:06.155
- And I'm going to teach you,
just like my dad taught me,

1:23:06.198 --> 1:23:07.678
and his dad taught him.

1:23:07.721 --> 1:23:09.593
- And you taught Daddy.

1:23:09.636 --> 1:23:11.682
Mm-hmm.
