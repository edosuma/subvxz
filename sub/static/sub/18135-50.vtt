Help?
What does help get you?

02:13.418 --> 02:15.418
Nothing! What does it get me?

02:15.486 --> 02:17.155
20% of nothing.

02:17.223 --> 02:19.077
Help, shmelp!

02:19.482 --> 02:20.718
You're right, Morty.

02:20.822 --> 02:22.722
I'm not gonna let
anything spoil this.

02:22.826 --> 02:24.997
It all belongs to me.

02:28.896 --> 02:31.395
This all belong to Kasnia.

02:35.639 --> 02:38.084
What was that?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.475
The competition.

02:40.558 --> 02:43.748
He ruined my premiere.

02:43.866 --> 02:45.227
Win some, lose some.

02:45.295 --> 02:47.826
It's not like you can
do something.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.545
Let's go!

02:49.733 --> 02:51.678
Oh, I can do something.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.780
I can teach that
Kasnian creep

02:53.889 --> 02:55.881
to stay out of my spotlight.

02:56.248 --> 02:57.321
Ha!

02:57.417 --> 02:58.650
That's my girl!

02:58.746 --> 03:02.188
Go give Comrade Buzzkill
the old one-two.

03:02.256 --> 03:03.756
I'm right behind you.

03:40.235 --> 03:41.506
Yikes!

04:09.773 --> 04:11.744
Ow! Watch it!

04:12.138 --> 04:13.704
Oops! Oh, sorry, little buddy.

04:13.769 --> 04:15.807
I'm Booster Gold,
time traveler.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.334
Who cares?

04:19.576 --> 04:20.612
I like you.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.130
Well, stop it.

04:22.274 --> 04:26.379
So, I was just outside the space-time
continuum in my Booster cave...

04:26.499 --> 04:27.799
It's not really a cave,

04:27.887 --> 04:30.014
I just call it that
'cause of the smell.

04:30.222 --> 04:31.389
I wasn't gone that long

04:31.457 --> 04:34.766
but now Superman and Supergirl
are dressed all weird

04:34.834 --> 04:36.108
and fighting each other.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.991
You don't say.

04:41.233 --> 04:42.292
I do say!

04:42.386 --> 04:45.265
Normally, when this kind of thing happens
it's because I went back in time

04:45.332 --> 04:46.535
and swallowed a butterfly.

04:46.603 --> 04:49.162
But this time,
I knows it wasn't me.

04:49.312 --> 04:50.608
How?

04:50.855 --> 04:52.222
Because I switched
to caterpillars.

04:52.290 --> 04:53.800
Anyways, the point is,

04:53.909 --> 04:55.667
I didn't cause this.

04:56.189 --> 04:57.675
Hey, that's not your car,
is it?

05:02.646 --> 05:05.181
Hey! Knock it off,
you guys!

05:05.432 --> 05:07.565
Why are you fighting
each other?

05:08.476 --> 05:10.081
Also, why is
my phone telling me

05:10.149 --> 05:13.300
that Justice League is now a
semi-pro bowling team out of Fresno?

05:17.098 --> 05:18.753
Superman, what are you doing?

05:18.834 --> 05:20.026
That's Supergirl!

05:20.094 --> 05:22.175
Your cousin who hasn't
gone out with me yet.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.448
Strong lady is cousin?

05:24.739 --> 05:26.526
Yes, from Krypton.

05:26.641 --> 05:28.636
By way of Kansas.

05:28.723 --> 05:31.276
Is this not ringing
a bell for you?

05:31.368 --> 05:32.847
Kansas?

05:39.137 --> 05:41.222
We've got to get close enough
to reverse the current.

05:41.305 --> 05:42.408
Follow my lead, cuz.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.558
Right behind you.

06:01.161 --> 06:04.286
Is it just me, or are the twisters
around here are getting stronger?

06:04.763 --> 06:06.950
Maybe you're just
slowing down in your old age.

06:07.104 --> 06:09.403
You know, technically,
you're the older cousin.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.167
Hang on.

06:11.255 --> 06:12.591
Blueberry pie?

06:12.829 --> 06:14.153
Ma Kent's blueberry pie.

06:14.256 --> 06:16.403
Best in the universe.
You wanna...

06:16.471 --> 06:17.700
Oh, it's on.

06:19.118 --> 06:22.169
A quick stop at Henderson's dairy
and I will be right there.

06:27.958 --> 06:29.169
Pardon me.

06:29.880 --> 06:32.752
Mmm. So many calories.

06:32.841 --> 06:35.098
But so worth it.

06:37.819 --> 06:39.005
You ever think about,

06:39.073 --> 06:41.778
how different life would be if
we weren't raised in Smallville?

06:41.984 --> 06:44.536
You know, I think that no matter
where they grow up, deep down,

06:44.604 --> 06:46.596
everyone has
a little Smallville in them.

06:46.722 --> 06:49.096
Super corny, but, I'll second that.

06:49.161 --> 06:50.728
Hey, turn it up.
I love this one.

06:50.793 --> 06:52.266
- Turn what up?
- The TV.

06:52.331 --> 06:54.911
Ma doesn't have a TV in the
house, let alone on the porch.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.481
What? What are you...

06:57.237 --> 06:58.770
Fine. I'll do it.

06:59.955 --> 07:01.689
<i>There is
a fifth dimension</i>

07:01.799 --> 07:05.528
<i>beyond what is known
to you backwards hicks.</i>

07:06.067 --> 07:08.614
<i>It's a world between
day and night.</i>

07:08.684 --> 07:12.075
<i>Between light and...
You call that light?</i>

07:12.218 --> 07:15.052
<i>Nestled between the truth
and what I think</i>

07:15.117 --> 07:16.994
<i>is generally more fun.</i>

07:17.087 --> 07:19.291
<i>It's an area which we call...</i>

07:19.545 --> 07:21.838
<i>The MXY Zone.</i>

07:24.887 --> 07:27.058
- Is that...
- Mr. Mxyzptlk.

07:27.139 --> 07:28.538
You've got to be kidding me.

07:28.606 --> 07:30.832
<i>Submitted for your annoyance.</i>

07:30.900 --> 07:32.640
<i>Nature versus nurture.</i>

07:32.705 --> 07:34.909
<i>Two Smallville goodie-goodies</i>

07:34.974 --> 07:37.260
<i>who think their lives
would be the same</i>

07:37.373 --> 07:40.549
<i>no matter how or where
they grew up.</i>

07:40.617 --> 07:41.683
That's great, Mxy.

07:41.751 --> 07:43.458
Now, why don't we...

07:43.582 --> 07:45.249
Pipe down, Super Stooge!

07:45.314 --> 07:48.919
<i>But what if a simple twist
of fate sent one cousin</i>

07:48.984 --> 07:51.525
<i>not to peace-loving Kansas,</i>

07:51.590 --> 07:53.682
<i>but across the ocean to...</i>

07:53.878 --> 07:55.510
<i>I don't know!</i>

07:56.214 --> 07:58.729
<i>War time Kasnia!</i>

08:00.003 --> 08:01.119
Uh-oh.

08:01.187 --> 08:03.112
<i>And sent the other to...</i>

08:03.448 --> 08:04.936
<i>Let's see.</i>

08:05.004 --> 08:07.737
<i>A more shallow pool.</i>

08:08.420 --> 08:12.292
Mxy, I swear I will make you
say your name backwards so...

08:12.360 --> 08:15.448
Ha! This I gotta see!

08:15.660 --> 08:18.370
So, strong lady is cousin

08:18.484 --> 08:21.643
and this is all just
annoying imp trick?

08:21.773 --> 08:23.526
That's absurd!

08:25.324 --> 08:26.724
My agent is right.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.877
It's total science fiction.

08:28.965 --> 08:30.942
No, it actually...
Wait, agent?

08:31.476 --> 08:32.712
You!

08:32.815 --> 08:35.028
Never told me you were
an agent.

08:37.381 --> 08:39.235
So considering
it's named after you and all,

08:39.303 --> 08:41.299
you think I can get a spot
on that <i>Mxy Zone</i> show?

08:41.384 --> 08:43.321
That thing sounds terrif.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.536
Golden Oaf is right.

08:45.604 --> 08:47.778
Agent is Mxyzptlk.

08:48.013 --> 08:49.980
- A what?
- This is my agent Morty.

08:50.045 --> 08:51.979
He made me the person
I am today.

08:52.047 --> 08:54.455
Exactly. It is imp in disguise

08:54.526 --> 08:55.996
who made us this way.

08:56.138 --> 08:58.171
Even this simple clown
could see through.

08:58.253 --> 09:00.494
Oh, clown? Where?

09:00.634 --> 09:04.696
Fine! You outsmarted me
this time, Booster Gold.

09:05.564 --> 09:09.051
But I promise you
it will not happen again!

09:09.119 --> 09:11.291
Sorry, what? I was still looking
for the clown. -

09:18.845 --> 09:20.311
What has imp done?

09:20.383 --> 09:22.587
What are we doing?

09:22.655 --> 09:24.846
What he made us do.

09:25.020 --> 09:27.400
How could you?
He was only trying to help.

09:27.486 --> 09:29.783
You're better off without him.
Trust me.

09:29.851 --> 09:32.353
Now!
Let's reset this reality

09:32.421 --> 09:35.556
and get you two
self-righteous bumpkins

09:35.692 --> 09:37.799
back at each other's throats.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.471
Huh! Foolish imp.

09:39.572 --> 09:41.963
It is just like we say
in my country.

09:42.071 --> 09:44.713
Kltpzyxm.

09:44.882 --> 09:46.889
I know...

09:46.978 --> 09:50.658
But what the heck
does Kltpzyxm...

09:50.726 --> 09:52.263
Oh, no.

09:53.955 --> 09:56.205
Um, what just happened?

09:56.317 --> 09:59.041
I make him say
his own name backwards.

09:59.197 --> 10:03.768
I remember, this is how we vanish annoying
imp and set things back to normal.

10:06.959 --> 10:08.759
Good bye, Golden Oaf.

10:08.824 --> 10:10.294
And thank you.

10:15.265 --> 10:17.202
Do you... Remember?

10:17.353 --> 10:18.826
Everything.

10:18.938 --> 10:20.775
Look, I want you to know that

10:20.848 --> 10:22.582
even though
we weren't ourselves...

10:22.728 --> 10:24.802
I know that
I would never, I...

10:24.984 --> 10:26.973
Well, I never could have,
um...

10:28.600 --> 10:30.106
I love you too.

10:32.879 --> 10:35.395
Um... What about me?

10:35.653 --> 10:38.119
I took a giant steel globe
to the head for you guys.

10:38.187 --> 10:40.021
I'm fine by the way,
thanks for asking.

10:40.089 --> 10:41.465
Did you eat our pie?

10:41.809 --> 10:44.091
Would you look at that? I'm
getting an urgent time call.

10:44.159 --> 10:46.063
So weird. I gotta go. Bye.

10:51.121 --> 10:52.529
You ever think about

10:52.613 --> 10:55.614
how different life would be if
we weren't born on Krypton?

10:55.791 --> 10:56.961
Nope!
