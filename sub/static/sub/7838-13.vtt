00:28.271 --> 00:31.975
Is there anything more fun
than a nice Sunday drive?

00:31.976 --> 00:33.620
Oh, yeah, it's great.

00:33.786 --> 00:35.972
Why don't we top it off
by reading to old people?

00:36.170 --> 00:36.919
Well, I think

00:37.079 --> 00:40.046
in these days of petro-terrorists
and ozone depletion,

00:40.227 --> 00:42.408
a Sunday drive reeks
of bio-hubris.

00:42.656 --> 00:45.612
Hey! Hey, it's
Krusty The Clown!

00:45.613 --> 00:48.085
What do you say, Krusty?
- What?!

00:48.086 --> 00:51.697
Can't I get a cup of coffee without
doing a monkey dance for you freaks?

00:51.919 --> 00:54.642
The fishing hat means
leave me alone!

00:54.801 --> 00:57.399
Always nice to see him.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.481
How did Dad get out
of this snooze cruise?

00:59.648 --> 01:00.905
He's cleaning out the garage.

01:01.051 --> 01:02.448
I can picture it now.

01:04.688 --> 01:08.044
I cleaned out the garage
and lost 50 pounds.

01:16.841 --> 01:20.238
It seems a shame to chuck out
these cross-country skis.

01:21.345 --> 01:22.257
I'll keep one.

01:24.101 --> 01:25.044
Let's see, now.

01:25.221 --> 01:26.723
"Kill spiders"?

01:26.878 --> 01:28.324
We don't have spiders.

01:36.131 --> 01:37.249
Stupid spider!

01:37.405 --> 01:38.204
Afraid of dying?

01:53.944 --> 01:54.655
What?!

01:54.854 --> 01:57.260
Spider poison is people poison?!

02:00.044 --> 02:00.983
Bart!

02:01.964 --> 02:03.685
Hm, where's the pain?

02:05.150 --> 02:06.038
There it is!

02:11.563 --> 02:12.485
A spider?!

02:32.688 --> 02:33.657
Homie!

02:35.070 --> 02:37.076
Time to open the
envelope I gave you.

02:44.845 --> 02:45.707
Out of the way!

02:45.873 --> 02:47.805
I learned CPR while
waiting for other kids

02:47.806 --> 02:48.983
to finish their math tests.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.809
Compress his chest!
- I'm on it.

03:02.530 --> 03:03.509
Hey! Wha...?!

03:03.689 --> 03:05.459
Wha' happened?!
Where am I?!

03:05.777 --> 03:08.164
Who put those spiders
in my mouth?!

03:08.463 --> 03:10.901
Oh, thank God! He's alive!

03:12.972 --> 03:14.242
You wouldn't believe
what happened to me!

03:14.243 --> 03:15.770
I tried to do what
you told me to, but...

03:15.771 --> 03:16.792
I don't even know
what happened...

03:21.962 --> 03:24.043
Honey?
- I'll try to remember....

03:24.981 --> 03:28.558
near-fatal booboo today
really scared me.

03:28.718 --> 03:31.610
What would the kids and I do
if something happened to you?

03:31.764 --> 03:34.230
Don't worry, if I croak,

03:34.408 --> 03:36.073
you'll marry Lenny... or Moe.

03:36.229 --> 03:38.677
The winner will be determined
by a card game I invented.

03:38.842 --> 03:40.501
I got all the rules
written down...

03:40.645 --> 03:41.639
up here.

03:41.876 --> 03:43.432
You keep almost dying.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.809
Just look at our
vacation photos.

03:45.994 --> 03:48.550
Vacation, all I ever wanted

03:48.746 --> 03:51.792
Vacation, had to get away

03:51.972 --> 03:55.398
Vacation, meant to be spent alone...

03:56.399 --> 03:57.795
Homie, if you die,

03:57.984 --> 04:00.543
I'm gonna have three
kids to take care of.

04:00.759 --> 04:03.253
I want you to buy
some life insurance.

04:03.429 --> 04:05.121
Please?

04:05.944 --> 04:08.837
Sure. If it'll give you
peace of mind.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.630
But I'm not gonna die
for many, many years.

04:12.792 --> 04:15.245
I know. I just want to b...

04:30.195 --> 04:32.525
Mr. Simpson, before
we can insure you,

04:32.526 --> 04:34.254
we need to ask you
some questions.

04:34.373 --> 04:35.890
Have you ever had
a heart attack?

04:36.037 --> 04:37.134
Haven't we all?

04:37.461 --> 04:38.287
Strokes?
- None.

04:38.543 --> 04:39.397
No, wait, three.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.324
Since the last one,
I don't remember so good.

04:44.076 --> 04:46.306
Are you a smoker?
- Yes, I am.

04:46.446 --> 04:47.461
You don't smoke!

04:47.595 --> 04:50.108
Shh! I want her
to think I'm cool!

04:51.713 --> 04:53.369
If I sign it,
it still counts!

04:56.844 --> 04:58.320
My hemophilia!

05:01.255 --> 05:02.552
Uninsurable?!

05:07.688 --> 05:11.126
I'm not gonna worry just because
Homer doesn't have insurance.

05:11.297 --> 05:12.661
A lot of people don't.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.661
Wifetime TV presents,

05:14.915 --> 05:17.609
From Homemaker to Homeless.

05:17.754 --> 05:21.339
Oh, Roger, I just love our
present lifestyle.

05:21.493 --> 05:22.405
Don't thank me.

05:22.536 --> 05:24.580
Thank our many debts
and obligations.

05:29.280 --> 05:29.816
Honey...

05:29.995 --> 05:31.557
stop kidding around.

05:31.698 --> 05:32.544
Honey?!

05:36.191 --> 05:39.025
Brenda, I'm afraid your
husband had no insurance.

05:39.210 --> 05:40.633
Well, how will
I feed my family?

05:40.770 --> 05:41.633
You should have
thought of that

05:41.634 --> 05:43.995
before you had children
with a dead man.

05:46.828 --> 05:49.223
Oh, this is only based
on a story.

05:49.404 --> 05:51.919
A true story!

05:53.633 --> 05:55.763
Brenda!  Where's
your wealth?

05:55.933 --> 05:57.833
Gone! Along with my sanity!

05:59.429 --> 06:01.175
But I'm still pretty, right?

06:01.291 --> 06:02.087
Right?

06:02.326 --> 06:05.060
The real Brenda later went
to Harvard Medical School..

06:05.222 --> 06:07.093
As a cadaver.

06:08.101 --> 06:10.143
We need to start saving.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.642
Go easy on that!

06:12.801 --> 06:14.811
It's got to last
till you're five.

06:22.004 --> 06:23.125
Budget-0's?!

06:24.217 --> 06:25.005
That's right.

06:25.132 --> 06:28.348
It's much less expensive than
the leading clown-based cereal.

06:28.349 --> 06:30.318
You just have to assemble it
yourself.

06:33.653 --> 06:36.142
We saved fifty cents
on that purchase.

06:38.526 --> 06:40.378
Mom, why are you
so worried about money?

06:40.534 --> 06:42.385
Oh, we're just saving for...

06:42.548 --> 06:44.963
a very rainy day.

06:45.145 --> 06:47.205
You mean when the big tuna
goes belly-up?

06:47.791 --> 06:50.538
Well, I just think we should
be building a nest egg.

06:50.701 --> 06:51.699
Way ahead of you, Marge.

06:51.852 --> 06:54.421
I just ordered a series
of tapes on saving money.

06:54.558 --> 06:55.828
They should get here soon.

06:55.981 --> 06:57.590
I paid a bundle
for overnight delivery.

06:57.743 --> 07:01.310
I have a book from the library
with the same information.

07:01.459 --> 07:04.046
Okay, I'll just hire a haulage
firm to cart them away...

07:04.191 --> 07:05.816
at my expense!

07:06.785 --> 07:07.829
Directory assistance?

07:08.038 --> 07:09.618
No more directory assistance!

07:09.773 --> 07:10.721
It's  not free.

07:10.862 --> 07:12.109
Well, I'll get
a lawyer on that.

07:12.253 --> 07:13.475
No, a whole team of lawyers,

07:13.643 --> 07:16.193
who will dine on mustard
flown in from the Orient.

07:16.324 --> 07:18.081
No more oriental mustard!

07:21.790 --> 07:22.788
It's so embarrassing.

07:22.789 --> 07:25.226
Mom is making us wear
clothes from Goodwill.

07:29.076 --> 07:31.243
People died in
those shirts.

07:43.599 --> 07:44.729
No outside suds!

07:44.869 --> 07:45.783
I'm sorry, Moe.

07:45.948 --> 07:48.098
Marge won't let me
spend any money--

07:48.237 --> 07:50.072
even counterfeit money!

07:52.614 --> 07:54.733
It's my money.
I'm the one who earns it.

07:54.734 --> 07:57.696
Drinking beer out
of a thermos like an animal.

07:58.737 --> 08:01.052
Can you help me unload
this soup from the car?

08:01.216 --> 08:03.787
There was a sale,
so I bought 400 cans.

08:03.973 --> 08:06.534
Marge, your penny-pinching
rampage has gone too far.

08:06.712 --> 08:09.124
Oh, honey, I know
it's not easy,

08:09.273 --> 08:11.323
but we've got
to put money away.

08:11.477 --> 08:13.605
You can't enjoy money
when you're dead,

08:13.786 --> 08:15.168
so why not have fun now?

08:15.344 --> 08:17.674
Don't you think you've
had enough "fun"?

08:17.888 --> 08:21.484
Last year, you spent
$5,000 on donuts,

08:21.672 --> 08:24.073
$2,000 on scalp massages,

08:24.228 --> 08:26.575
$500 on body glitter...

08:26.741 --> 08:27.909
Hey, I earn that money.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.291
While you lounge around
here,

08:29.298 --> 08:31.135
doing laundry
and putting up drywall,

08:31.283 --> 08:33.265
I'm at work busting my hump.

08:33.433 --> 08:34.860
Oh, please.

08:35.018 --> 08:35.946
From what I hear,

08:36.091 --> 08:37.806
you waltz in there at 10:30,

08:37.976 --> 08:39.323
take a nap on the toilet,

08:39.491 --> 08:42.190
then sit around Googling your
own name until lunch.

08:42.346 --> 08:43.203
Who told you that?

08:43.359 --> 08:45.546
You shouted it
while we were making love.

08:45.697 --> 08:46.797
Now, look here, mister.

08:46.959 --> 08:47.876
I pay the bills,

08:48.027 --> 08:49.042
I do the budget,

08:49.043 --> 08:50.942
and I'm in charge
of the money.

08:58.427 --> 09:00.903
Are you going to let
her push you around?

09:01.089 --> 09:03.727
Yeah, show that skirt
who's boss, see?

09:03.901 --> 09:05.770
Give us our independence, Homer.

09:05.953 --> 09:07.259
Yes, President Franklin.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.474
I, uh, was never president.

09:09.669 --> 09:12.005
I invented some kind of stove.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.740
Well, I invented a Popsicle
made of Mountain Dew.

09:14.920 --> 09:15.899
Sweet.

09:15.965 --> 09:17.514
Yeah, yeah,
that's swell.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.032
My scrimpings!

09:35.978 --> 09:36.970
You banged?

09:37.028 --> 09:39.962
Did you spend our savings
on a motor home?

09:40.162 --> 09:40.729
No.

09:40.942 --> 09:44.408
I spent our savings on the down
payment for a motor home.

09:44.590 --> 09:46.529
I need a castle
where I can be king!

09:46.701 --> 09:48.827
Well, I hope you enjoy
it, Your Majesty,

09:49.010 --> 09:51.014
'cause I'm not speaking to you.

10:01.000 --> 10:01.953
Damn it!

10:03.610 --> 10:05.365
Kids, your mother
and I have decided

10:05.366 --> 10:07.164
to take a little
break from each other.

10:07.225 --> 10:08.742
While we deal
with our issues,

10:08.896 --> 10:11.705
I plan to go
on Motorhome Makeover.

10:11.859 --> 10:13.818
and trick this thing out
like a palace,

10:13.972 --> 10:15.783
not like that
dump you live in.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.423
All I need is for someone
to start a show called :

10:18.424 --> 10:19.693
Motorhome Makeover.

10:19.745 --> 10:20.291
I see.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.174
ou were mad enough
to leave our house,

10:22.356 --> 10:24.404
but not mad enough
to leave our property.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.117
That's my half-assed dad.

10:26.254 --> 10:28.028
Hey, I couldn't
leave you kids.

10:28.187 --> 10:29.361
You're like
my own family.

10:29.527 --> 10:31.253
Now check
this place out.

10:33.780 --> 10:34.541
Neat!

10:34.702 --> 10:36.496
When I sleep
at Dad's, I call this bed.

10:36.655 --> 10:38.257
You can have it.
This one's way better.

10:38.436 --> 10:39.400
That's a
bread compartment.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.620
You're a bread
compartment!

10:40.650 --> 10:42.488
Kids!
Come back in the house!

10:42.610 --> 10:44.150
Oh, do we have to?

10:44.181 --> 10:46.546
I  melted string cheese
over some corn chips.

10:46.547 --> 10:47.741
Oh, boy!

10:47.885 --> 10:49.442
I've  got Gameboys
and caramel apples!

10:49.591 --> 10:51.226
I'll let you sass me!

10:51.378 --> 10:52.500
I'll let you punch me!

10:52.678 --> 10:54.838
You can wear swimsuits
instead of underwear!

10:55.000 --> 10:56.701
We'll have
Christmas tomorrow!

10:59.079 --> 11:00.650
Welcome to the jungle

11:00.900 --> 11:02.553
We got fun 'n' games

11:02.803 --> 11:04.750
We got everything you want

11:05.000 --> 11:06.295
Honey, we know the names

11:06.330 --> 11:10.354
We are the people that can find
whatever you may need...

11:14.018 --> 11:15.003
Free gas!

11:15.253 --> 11:17.767
Well, it's a pleasure to meet
another sultan of the slow lane.

11:18.017 --> 11:20.006
That's my rig over there.

11:20.256 --> 11:21.850
She's a Roam-a-way SilverCoach.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.050
34  feet of walnut-burled freedom.

11:26.079 --> 11:27.450
Boy, I wouldn't mind driving that

11:27.700 --> 11:29.953
to the Holland, Michigan Tulip Festival.

11:30.203 --> 11:32.400
I'm looking for a place to dock the beast.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.468
I don't mean you, Martha.

11:34.718 --> 11:36.668
I've never loved you either.

11:38.153 --> 11:41.553
We use jokes to mask our pain
at the death of our son.

11:42.153 --> 11:43.203
Really.

11:43.717 --> 11:45.106
A place to dock?

11:45.556 --> 11:46.150
I got room.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.829
I have a backyard that makes my
front yard look like an idiot.

11:50.279 --> 11:52.329
Can I bring the rest of the convoy?

11:53.900 --> 11:54.853
Are you crazy?

11:55.103 --> 11:57.750
Let 12 complete strangers live on my lawn?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.768
Well, we'll give you regional beers.

12:00.018 --> 12:01.118
It's a deal!

12:01.753 --> 12:03.303
And there you have it.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.017
Welcome, welcome.

12:06.456 --> 12:09.050
If my wife asks, you're here for a Boz Skaggs concert.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.300
Homer!

12:11.379 --> 12:14.250
What are all these recreational vehicles doing here?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.353
These are my new friends.

12:16.603 --> 12:18.850
They like me for me...

12:19.100 --> 12:21.068
and my plumbing and gas hookups.

12:21.318 --> 12:23.203
Young lady, I like what you're driving.

12:23.453 --> 12:25.867
Is that one of them two-level Wander-Kings?

12:26.117 --> 12:28.167
This is a house!

12:33.056 --> 12:35.706
Hey, boys, let's play her the RV National Anthem.

12:42.279 --> 12:44.550
Daddy, all the fumes are making me dizzy.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.453
Well, now, Roddy, the Lord
wouldn't let us die this way.

12:47.703 --> 12:48.650
That's right, Ned.

12:48.900 --> 12:52.000
Now, you three take a little nap
while I make some hot chocolate.

12:55.918 --> 12:57.803
I've been everywhere, man

12:58.053 --> 12:59.567
I've been everywhere

12:59.817 --> 13:01.906
Travel, I've done my share, man

13:02.156 --> 13:03.650
I've been everywhere

13:03.900 --> 13:05.929
I've been to Springfield Shelbyville, Ogdenville

13:06.179 --> 13:07.950
Cap City, Ogdenberg, Shelbytown Spring City,

13:08.200 --> 13:09.953
Capfield, West Springfield Paris, Rome

13:10.203 --> 13:11.203
and Shelbyville adjacent...

13:11.500 --> 13:12.568
Sing it, baby!

13:12.818 --> 13:14.068
That's a lot of places.

13:15.553 --> 13:16.967
I know another place you can go!

13:17.217 --> 13:18.206
To sleep.

13:18.456 --> 13:18.950
Sorry, Marge.

13:19.200 --> 13:23.150
We've got the power now, and you can't turn us off!

13:25.379 --> 13:27.679
Can't turn off the power?

13:31.100 --> 13:34.350
Sashay this and fancy that Watch
the dog dance with the cat...

13:39.900 --> 13:41.650
Lights out, weirdos!

13:48.118 --> 13:50.803
I was making a Monte Cristo
sandwich when my crisper cut out.

13:51.053 --> 13:54.453
It's not golden brown,
it's not brown, it's not nothin'.

14:07.956 --> 14:09.750
You don't belong on the lawn.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.129
You belong in your bed with your wife.

14:12.379 --> 14:13.650
That's no marriage bed.

14:13.900 --> 14:16.900
It's a loveless slab of bossiness!

14:17.603 --> 14:18.850
Well, you're not perfect either!

14:19.100 --> 14:21.068
Name one way I'm not.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.703
You hide food in my hair.

14:22.953 --> 14:25.803
You think brushing your
teeth is foreplay...

14:26.117 --> 14:29.006
I'll have you know I could
have married Sideshow Mel!

14:29.256 --> 14:30.529
Boy, they're really going at it.

14:30.779 --> 14:31.850
Do you think they're gonna get divorced?

14:32.100 --> 14:35.153
No. I don't see Dad doing all that paperwork.

14:35.403 --> 14:39.150
What? I seem to recall you
asked me to get this fat!

14:39.400 --> 14:39.768
Oh, boy.

14:40.018 --> 14:43.018
Let's get out of here before
Dad does a bad impression of Mom.

14:43.953 --> 14:45.567
I'm Marge Simpson.

14:45.817 --> 14:48.317
Don't eat off the floor.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.150
I am so sick of that story

14:50.400 --> 14:53.129
about finding an onion ring
in your French fries.

14:53.379 --> 14:55.350
It was 20 years ago.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.200
That was my Woodstock!

14:59.503 --> 15:01.050
You know what started all this trouble?

15:01.300 --> 15:02.268
This motor home.

15:02.518 --> 15:05.703
How can a vehicle this cool
destroy a marriage that crappy?

15:05.953 --> 15:08.867
Hey, I know this is a crazy idea,
but hear me out.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.306
What if we...

15:10.556 --> 15:11.750
Take this back to the dealer?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.829
Wow, I was gonna say "Call Reverend Lovejoy,"

15:14.079 --> 15:14.950
but I guess this could work.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.050
Oh yeah, Marge?

15:17.503 --> 15:19.450
What about my womanly needs?

15:26.600 --> 15:28.368
Slowly, slowly.

15:28.618 --> 15:31.803
The RV dealer is across town
under that gorilla blimp.

15:32.053 --> 15:33.267
How do you know that's their blimp?

15:33.517 --> 15:35.517
Duh! It's Kamper Kong.

15:38.656 --> 15:41.750
Bob, word on the street is there's
two kids trying to return an RV.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.229
Return an RV?!

15:43.479 --> 15:44.479
Return an RV?!

15:46.800 --> 15:48.800
Tie me to the Kong and cut its tethers.

15:49.503 --> 15:51.350
You don't take anything seriously.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.468
Not even your bankruptcy hearing!

15:53.718 --> 15:55.403
Hey, that judge thought I rocked.

15:55.653 --> 15:56.667
Case closed!

15:56.917 --> 15:58.767
Although my case is still open.

15:59.056 --> 16:01.056
If you need me, I'll be in my trailer!

16:04.079 --> 16:05.179
My RV is gone!

16:06.900 --> 16:08.453
It was more than a motor home.

16:08.703 --> 16:11.753
It was a car I could go to the bathroom in.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.400
Hey, a note.

16:16.118 --> 16:19.803
Dear Mom and Dad: "We don't
want you guys to split up,

16:20.053 --> 16:22.767
so we're driving the RV back to the dealer."

16:23.617 --> 16:25.906
We've got to stop them.

16:26.156 --> 16:28.250
This is a parent's worst nightmare!

16:28.500 --> 16:31.450
They've stolen a car and they're home alone.

16:34.579 --> 16:38.550
Let's see, the RV dealership is
across the freeway on the corner of...

16:39.400 --> 16:41.753
This is a Flintstones Fun Map.

16:42.003 --> 16:42.650
Look...

16:42.900 --> 16:43.768
Dad wrote something:

16:44.018 --> 16:45.853
Dino-- short for dinosaur?

16:46.103 --> 16:48.153
Remember to ask Jeeves.

16:53.404 --> 16:54.404
We're on the freeway!

16:58.517 --> 16:59.806
Would you look at those Simpson kids.

17:00.056 --> 17:03.850
Last year it was Razor scooters,
this year they're driving RVs.

17:04.099 --> 17:06.628
When I was a kid, my mom would
give me an empty egg carton

17:06.878 --> 17:09.250
and I'd pretend it was a
spaceship to the moon.

17:09.900 --> 17:12.053
You'll never guess what I used for astronauts.

17:12.502 --> 17:14.453
I'm going to say eggs.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.200
Shut up.

17:18.018 --> 17:19.917
Oh, my God, there they are!

17:31.053 --> 17:32.167
I've lost them!

17:32.417 --> 17:34.906
I can't see past all the SUVs!

17:35.156 --> 17:36.450
Don't worry about the SUVs.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.650
There's a gentle curve up ahead.

17:46.179 --> 17:47.350
Bart! Pull over!

17:47.600 --> 17:48.453
We'll stop fighting,

17:48.703 --> 17:49.750
we promise!

17:50.000 --> 17:50.768
Prove it!

17:51.018 --> 17:52.203
Yeah, kiss and make up!

17:52.453 --> 17:55.767
We're not quite there yet,
but we've opened up a dialogue!

17:56.017 --> 17:58.167
Not good enough! Kiss!

18:00.356 --> 18:01.629
French it up, lover boy!

18:01.879 --> 18:04.350
I'm not a machine. I can't just turn it on!

18:04.900 --> 18:06.350
Come here.

18:10.003 --> 18:11.150
Now pull over!

18:11.400 --> 18:12.768
First, raise my allowance.

18:13.018 --> 18:14.318
Why you little...!

18:18.545 --> 18:19.867
We're going downhill...

18:20.117 --> 18:22.817
and I can't reach the brakes!

18:29.756 --> 18:30.150
Look!

18:30.400 --> 18:31.429
"Runaway Truck Lane!"

18:31.679 --> 18:32.879
We're saved!

18:36.700 --> 18:37.850
Ah, rats.

18:51.003 --> 18:53.250
Thank God for that Turkish freighter.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.600
Now we'll just go get them and...

18:56.818 --> 18:59.403
My kids are on your boat. Turn back!

18:59.653 --> 19:00.467
I see no kids.

19:00.717 --> 19:02.766
And we must get these Season One

19:02.766 --> 19:05.609
Northern Exposure DVDs
to Kahramanmaras.

19:08.806 --> 19:09.906
Help us!

19:10.000 --> 19:12.929
Bring back our children,
you Cyprus-splitting jerks!

19:13.779 --> 19:15.750
Just for that, we keep your children.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.103
Will you raise them Christian?

19:18.503 --> 19:20.103
Coptic Christian.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.368
Captain, wait!

19:24.618 --> 19:27.518
I have something here that might change your mind!

19:28.053 --> 19:29.167
What are you showing me? Soup?

19:29.417 --> 19:33.667
300 cans of Budget Club mushroom soup!

19:34.256 --> 19:36.250
If you have some noodles and tuna fish,

19:36.500 --> 19:41.829
you can make a casserole that's
small on price, but big on flavor.

19:42.079 --> 19:42.950
You are a wise woman.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.753
It is a shame you dress like a Lebanese prostitute.

19:46.003 --> 19:47.003
Return to the docks!

19:47.900 --> 19:50.900
Well, if he thinks he's getting
a corner piece, forget it.

19:59.118 --> 20:02.803
Wow, Marge, once again, your mom-ly
wisdom averted disaster.

20:03.053 --> 20:06.767
And I promise I will return this
RV first thing in the morning.

20:07.017 --> 20:09.167
Easy... easy...

20:09.556 --> 20:12.556
Easy... easy...

20:18.279 --> 20:22.279
Water damage-- can't be returned. I win again!

20:27.700 --> 20:28.753
It's only money.

20:29.003 --> 20:31.653
And  it did make a cool splash.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.668
Marge, you're taking this pretty well.

20:34.918 --> 20:38.803
Dude, she seemed tense, so we put
a little hashish in her meal.

20:39.053 --> 20:40.167
Cool.

20:40.417 --> 20:45.206
Which came first, turkey the
bird or Turkey the you guys?

20:45.656 --> 20:49.156
If you don't want to say it, just think it.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.329
Istanbul was Constantinople

20:51.579 --> 20:53.350
Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople

20:53.600 --> 20:54.753
Been a long time gone,

20:55.003 --> 20:56.750
Constantinople. Now it's Turkish delight

20:57.000 --> 20:59.900
on a moonlit night Istanbul!

21:03.618 --> 21:07.203
I've been everywhere, man,
I've been everywhere, man

21:07.453 --> 21:09.367
Cross the deserts bare, man

21:09.617 --> 21:11.406
I've breathed the mountain air, man

21:11.656 --> 21:14.656
Travel...
