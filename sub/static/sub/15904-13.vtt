WEBVTT

00:18.184 --> 00:20.520
"Simon and Kitty stood before

00:20.554 --> 00:23.890
"Pauline's crumbling
fieldstone marker.

00:23.923 --> 00:26.192
"Moments later,
in a nearby crypt,

00:26.226 --> 00:29.162
"Simon repeatedly
plunged into Kitty,

00:29.195 --> 00:31.365
"the sounds of their passion

00:31.398 --> 00:33.667
"mixing with the wet summer air

00:33.700 --> 00:37.070
and the cicadas' desperate,
deafening, doomed song."

00:37.103 --> 00:38.272
The end.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.674
I inspired the ending!

00:40.707 --> 00:42.108
You should put in the part
about pulling out

00:42.141 --> 00:43.343
so she doesn't have
a ghost baby.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.844
Just kidding.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.847
I think it's perfect.
I am so happy with it.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.016
I mean, a theme that
I hadn't planned on exploring

00:50.049 --> 00:52.352
was the fallacy
of the very concept

00:52.386 --> 00:54.954
of the familial paradigm in art.

00:54.988 --> 00:57.624
I mean, the idea
still persists

00:57.657 --> 00:59.359
that family, somehow,

00:59.393 --> 01:01.695
automatically
prescribes closeness.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.863
Family is portrayed as

01:03.897 --> 01:06.300
a safe harbor, but nay,

01:06.333 --> 01:10.637
it is often the very Charybdis
that yanks us to the fathoms.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.971
But not you, buddy.
Not me.

01:12.005 --> 01:15.542
I am post-family.

01:15.575 --> 01:19.479
You are looking, finally,
at a truly free man.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.147
Like Thoreau.

01:21.180 --> 01:22.649
Or the Unabomber.

01:22.682 --> 01:23.917
So...

01:23.950 --> 01:25.785
are we okay?

01:25.819 --> 01:27.454
Oh, my God, do we really
have to do thi...?

01:27.487 --> 01:29.456
Nope, nope, just checking.

01:33.192 --> 01:34.628
Did you hear about this murder
off Mulholland?

01:34.661 --> 01:35.795
What?

01:35.829 --> 01:36.996
Yeah, it was four days ago.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.298
They found this girl.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.900
And-- oh, that is gruesome!

01:40.934 --> 01:43.002
"Murder, She Tweeted"?

01:43.036 --> 01:44.438
How do I not follow
this account?

01:45.672 --> 01:47.907
Her head was chopped off.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.143
Her blood was drained?

01:50.176 --> 01:52.446
Bloody symbols on the rocks?

01:52.479 --> 01:54.013
Jimmy!

01:54.047 --> 01:55.482
This happened
right near our house.

01:55.515 --> 01:56.750
It could've been me!

01:56.783 --> 01:57.984
Can we go look?

01:58.017 --> 01:59.085
No way!

01:59.118 --> 02:00.987
It sounds very scary.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.756
Jimmy.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.627
Please?

02:07.661 --> 02:08.862
Please.
Oh.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.029
Please?

02:11.831 --> 02:12.799
Fine!

02:12.832 --> 02:15.435
You creepy, creepy murder girl.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.836
Yay!

02:16.870 --> 02:20.139
They say, when a murder scene
is fresh,

02:20.173 --> 02:23.810
you can still smell
the fear in the air.

02:23.843 --> 02:26.012
And afterwards, we can swing
by Echo Park and get paletas.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.985
*

02:34.854 --> 02:37.657
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:37.691 --> 02:40.360
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:40.394 --> 02:43.697
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.504
*

03:00.847 --> 03:03.917
Anyway, the show's called
Doug Loves Sketches,

03:03.950 --> 03:05.585
and it's a full-time gig.

03:05.619 --> 03:08.755
Like, this is what I'm
doing for a living now.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.490
I'm a comedy writer.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.759
Hey, can I get some salty
black sauce for this egg rice?

03:12.792 --> 03:14.828
Yeah.
Where's your food?

03:14.861 --> 03:16.563
Oh, I only have enough left
for Jimmy.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.666
Anyway, I'm super excited,

03:19.699 --> 03:22.502
but I'm also kind of nervous
to tell Dorothy.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.870
'Cause you're writing
for an Internet show

03:23.903 --> 03:25.171
and nobody cares about that?

03:25.204 --> 03:27.373
She's been really low lately

03:27.407 --> 03:29.909
and this might
hurt her feelings.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.344
So what?

03:31.377 --> 03:33.680
Brah, she's taking
that "D" on the reg;

03:33.713 --> 03:35.014
it's her job to support you.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.215
You got to speak up

03:36.249 --> 03:37.451
and tell people
what you want.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.953
You are the master

03:39.986 --> 03:41.688
of your own destiny.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.189
Don't be a martyr.

03:43.222 --> 03:44.458
I was a martyr.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.959
I almost martyred my husband,

03:45.992 --> 03:47.093
but I didn't.

03:47.126 --> 03:48.762
You're right, Lindsay.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.964
I should put myself first.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.298
So,

03:52.331 --> 03:54.468
can I have some
of your breakfast sushi?

03:54.501 --> 03:57.103
Sorry, I licked it all already.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.648
This is gonna be so rad.

04:08.682 --> 04:09.949
Maybe they marked
where the body is

04:09.983 --> 04:11.150
and I can lie down in it

04:11.184 --> 04:12.619
and experience her terror.

04:17.322 --> 04:18.892
Oh!

04:18.925 --> 04:20.494
Oh, my God,
It's so ugly.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.762
It looks like the fox
in the Nine Inch Nails video

04:22.796 --> 04:24.297
that's being eaten by ants.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.466
It looks like it should be
screaming at an old lady

04:26.500 --> 04:28.568
in an Aphex Twin video.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.269
Why is its face so swollen?

04:30.303 --> 04:32.906
Did Becca give birth
directly over a beehive?

04:32.939 --> 04:34.808
Even at an illegal baby mill,
they'd be like,

04:34.841 --> 04:36.309
"Yeah, that's okay.
We're good."

04:36.342 --> 04:38.177
Aw.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.948
Aah!
Aah!

04:41.981 --> 04:43.149
Oh, shitsticks!

04:43.182 --> 04:45.318
Jimmy, Five-O!

04:45.351 --> 04:46.620
Good spotting, Goose.

04:48.387 --> 04:49.656
*

05:02.502 --> 05:04.370
Hup!

05:06.372 --> 05:08.608
Yeah?
17 seconds. New record.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.376
Okay.

05:27.326 --> 05:28.662
Okay.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.029
Page one-- preliminary
settlement offer.

05:31.698 --> 05:34.000
You're supposed to write it
on a piece of paper

05:34.033 --> 05:35.702
and slide it over.

05:35.735 --> 05:36.970
Watch.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.674
Here's my initial offer.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.149
This is just a drawing of a cat.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.651
It's just a starting point.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.153
It's called a negotiation.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.055
Now, you go.

05:56.089 --> 06:00.159
My initial spousal
support offer is $2,000.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.761
Accepted!

06:01.795 --> 06:04.230
$2,000 a month, Lindsay.

06:04.263 --> 06:07.100
I know, that's so much money.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.668
I accept.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.537
Negotiations are over.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.907
You know, you have to pay
for your own apartment.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.509
Great. How much are apartments,
like two hundo?

06:16.542 --> 06:17.777
So, that's good.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.345
No, Lindsay.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.780
It's bad.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.716
It's really, really bad.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.154
I'm cucking you now.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.190
I'm the hot wife.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.526
I do not like
this piece of paper.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.630
I'm finally getting what I want,

06:36.663 --> 06:38.865
and what I want

06:38.898 --> 06:40.233
is to watch you burn.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.801
Oh, yes.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.469
Burn!

06:54.513 --> 06:55.649
Okay.

06:55.682 --> 06:59.018
Page two--
401K distributions.

07:00.486 --> 07:01.788
Uh, hi.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.056
Uh, Edgar Quintero.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.958
I have a meeting with Doug.
Oh, sure.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.793
Have a seat, Mr. Benson
will be right with you.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.895
Oh, uh, hey.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.630
What happened
to the other assistant?

07:10.664 --> 07:12.465
She died.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.901
Mugging in broad daylight.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.103
Fortunately, the guy she mugged
is gonna be fine.

07:17.136 --> 07:20.073
It's a joke.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.475
It was stomach cancer.
She went quick.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.479
Hey, can I ask you a question?

07:26.512 --> 07:27.613
Do you like your job?

07:27.647 --> 07:29.282
It's pretty great.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.450
It really suits my lifestyle.

07:31.484 --> 07:34.587
I just sit around all day,
answer some calls.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.422
You're supposed to throw away
your personal food

07:36.455 --> 07:38.658
at the end of the week,
but a lot of people don't.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.794
Gwen might be done
with that açaí bowl,

07:40.827 --> 07:42.295
but Dutch isn't.

07:44.163 --> 07:48.167
Well, would you ever give up
your job for a relationship?

07:48.201 --> 07:50.103
Whoa, uh...

07:50.136 --> 07:52.872
Well, that is completely
out of the blue.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.373
Edgar.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.608
Come on in.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.609
Thanks.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.211
What's up?

07:58.244 --> 08:00.646
Uh, listen, Doug.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.018
I can't do the show.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.720
My girlfriend...

08:06.753 --> 08:08.354
Sloppy-blowjob Dorothy?

08:08.387 --> 08:10.724
W-What?
Um...

08:10.757 --> 08:12.726
A-Anyway, she's...

08:12.759 --> 08:14.527
she's been going through
a really tough time,

08:14.560 --> 08:18.331
and I feel like
my having this opportunity

08:18.364 --> 08:19.966
is making her feel worse.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.702
I see.
Well, I'll be sad to see you go.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.804
Dutch, can you get me UTA?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.639
I need some lower level
writer résumés.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.641
I don't know,
maybe I'm making a mistake.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.010
I'm supposed to be supporting
her, but really, by quitting,

08:31.044 --> 08:32.544
I'm not standing up
for my needs,

08:32.578 --> 08:34.647
which is ultimately bad
for our relationship.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.816
So, maybe I shouldn't quit.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.183
Oh, cool!

08:38.217 --> 08:41.187
So, you just came into my office
to not quit.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.655
That's a pretty
good use of my time.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.658
So now I get to go
to your house with a sandwich

08:45.691 --> 08:47.994
and be like,
"I don't want this sandwich."

08:48.027 --> 08:51.064
But then say, "I want this
sandwich," and then explain why?

08:51.097 --> 08:53.399
So, I get to do that now?
Sure.

08:53.432 --> 08:54.834
That's actually
a really great bit.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.737
Get a camera,
shoot it over the weekend.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.172
I'll get Andy Richter
to play the sandwich

08:59.205 --> 09:00.406
and I'll see you on Monday.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.441
All right.

09:02.475 --> 09:05.945
Cool.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.716
All right, man.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.019
I just e-mailed Doug
my letter of resignation.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.087
What?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.188
I'm willing to try this

09:15.221 --> 09:16.355
with you, dude.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.291
I really don't think
I'm gay,

09:18.324 --> 09:20.293
but is my life so perfect

09:20.326 --> 09:22.128
that I can afford
to be closed off?

09:22.161 --> 09:23.462
And when you think about it,

09:23.496 --> 09:24.630
homosexuality really

09:24.663 --> 09:25.799
suits my lifestyle--

09:25.832 --> 09:27.466
sitting around,

09:27.500 --> 09:29.969
chugging cold ones,
playing vids...

09:30.003 --> 09:31.370
What? No.
Assume you got to suck a dick

09:31.404 --> 09:32.806
once in a while, but whatever.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.473
I've put weirder things
in my mouth.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.475
I-I-I was talking about me

09:36.509 --> 09:37.811
and my girlfriend.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.245
What?

09:39.278 --> 09:41.147
Oh, no!

09:41.180 --> 09:43.783
I just told Doug Benson I quit

09:43.817 --> 09:46.052
and to kiss my gay ass!

09:46.085 --> 09:48.421
He's been nothing
but nice to me!

09:48.454 --> 09:50.489
Why do I keep doing this?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.626
Hey-hey, Doug.

09:53.659 --> 09:54.994
What the hell
is going on?

09:55.028 --> 09:57.063
It was-- I'm not gay.
Are you kidding?

09:57.096 --> 09:59.698
I mean, I might be gay, but
I'm not... I don't think I am.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.906
I can't get
an Uber to pick me up.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.075
I think my rating's too low.
What's yours?

10:09.108 --> 10:11.144
Oh, bad.
Apparently, they don't like it

10:11.177 --> 10:12.411
when you call multiple companies

10:12.445 --> 10:14.247
and make them race
to pick you up.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.451
Becca's gonna be
the worst mom.

10:18.484 --> 10:19.752
You can tell just by looking

10:19.785 --> 10:21.654
at a kid, if they have
good or bad parents.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.789
Well, how?

10:23.823 --> 10:25.458
Okay.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.126
See that kid--
black dress socks,

10:27.160 --> 10:28.761
stained shirt?

10:28.794 --> 10:30.796
His parents don't give a shit.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.498
Now, that one

10:32.531 --> 10:35.835
with the perfect fade, pressed
shirt, he's totally hot.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.004
His parents care a shit ton.

10:38.037 --> 10:41.107
When I'm a mom, my kid is
gonna look fly as hell

10:41.140 --> 10:42.808
'cause I'm gonna care
the shit out of that kid.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.810
That kid's not that hot.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.545
Now, that kid,

10:46.579 --> 10:49.015
he's tanned a perfect bronze,

10:49.048 --> 10:50.683
his bod is banging.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.318
He doesn't even have a six-pack.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.320
Check out midriff.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.155
Oh! That ass!

10:56.189 --> 10:57.857
Like it was carved

10:57.891 --> 10:59.825
out of marble.
I think you two
should leave.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.294
- How dare you?!
- Who even becomes

11:01.327 --> 11:02.862
a third-grade
teacher anyhow?
This has nothing

11:02.896 --> 11:04.663
to do with you.
"Oh, I'm not
nurturing enough to be a

11:04.697 --> 11:06.465
"kindergarten teacher,
This is between us
and the urchins.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.234
"but I can't quite
master compound sentences.
Why don't you just

11:08.267 --> 11:09.969
go back to your job,
you old cow?
Where do I belong?"

11:11.237 --> 11:12.638
Hey,

11:12.671 --> 11:13.873
my therapist is
at Edendale.

11:13.907 --> 11:14.974
Want to come watch me
yell at her?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.643
You mean, instead of going
to the murder place?

11:17.676 --> 11:19.478
Oh, hell no. On the way.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.647
I just need you to see
how awesome I've gotten

11:21.680 --> 11:22.681
at heckling her.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.317
I found out
she has diabetes--

11:24.350 --> 11:25.651
really opened things up,

11:25.684 --> 11:27.353
high-ass sugar-having bitch.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.355
Huh, then we'll stop by the
house and pick up the car.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.991
Can you at least

11:32.025 --> 11:34.860
give me some money up-front
to get started?

11:34.894 --> 11:36.329
Please.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.780
Did you just actually open up
a bank app and deposit it

11:54.813 --> 11:57.283
or did you just
take a photo of it?

11:57.316 --> 11:58.617
What are you talking about?

11:58.651 --> 12:02.288
Did you observe people
using e-check deposit

12:02.321 --> 12:03.756
and now, as a result,

12:03.789 --> 12:05.524
think you can just
take a photo

12:05.558 --> 12:07.793
and it magically goes
into your bank account?

12:07.826 --> 12:11.130
Oh, my God.

12:11.164 --> 12:14.133
This is so freeing.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.071
I can finally say it.

12:18.104 --> 12:21.440
You are so stupid!

12:21.474 --> 12:22.608
Why does no one
talk about

12:22.641 --> 12:24.277
how dumb she is?

12:24.310 --> 12:25.711
She's like the
dumbest person

12:25.744 --> 12:27.646
on the planet!

12:27.680 --> 12:29.782
50 years ago,
she would be

12:29.815 --> 12:32.551
sterilized for the
good of evolution.
I'm not so

12:32.585 --> 12:35.054
stupid that I couldn't get you
to let me bone another guy

12:35.088 --> 12:36.422
in front of you
and make you think

12:36.455 --> 12:37.723
it was for our marriage.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.226
Get out!

12:40.259 --> 12:41.260
Out!

12:48.634 --> 12:50.569
Uh, excuse you.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.171
Ooh...

12:52.205 --> 12:55.074
Look who's here!

12:55.108 --> 12:56.909
Remember?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.677
That talking baby movie?

12:58.711 --> 12:59.945
Look Who's Here?

12:59.979 --> 13:01.747
Well, I'll tell you who's here.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.916
Tallulah.
Ooh, ooh.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.319
It's me, you turkeys.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.291
I'm ready, Vernon.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.760
I'm ready to start
a new life in Méjico

13:14.793 --> 13:16.762
and find a woman
who really loves me.

13:16.795 --> 13:17.863
What?

13:17.896 --> 13:20.099
Oh. Nah,

13:20.133 --> 13:21.500
I hadn't met the baby
when I said that.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.637
I love her so
goddamn much, nerd.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.472
Plus, I can't leave
her with Bec.

13:26.505 --> 13:28.974
She will JonBenét her fo' sho',

13:29.008 --> 13:31.677
or leave her on a bench at
the Marina del Rey Rosé Fest

13:31.710 --> 13:33.312
or some shit.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.514
You're really giving up
those big naturals?

13:37.883 --> 13:38.851
Huh.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.857
Tallulah.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.359
Uh, sorry, Paul.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.993
You're not part of
this family anymore.

13:48.027 --> 13:51.297
You know,
when I was in high school,

13:51.330 --> 13:53.399
you wouldn't have
existed to me.

13:53.432 --> 13:56.369
Now, we can just return to
that natural state of things.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.672
Hi.

14:04.777 --> 14:05.744
Vernon?

14:05.778 --> 14:07.713
Just go.

14:07.746 --> 14:08.714
Get out of here, nerd.

14:08.747 --> 14:09.815
But...

14:09.848 --> 14:11.417
Go on.

14:11.450 --> 14:12.451
Get!
Ah...

14:29.602 --> 14:31.036
Gretchen!
Ha!

14:31.070 --> 14:32.105
Found you again, dummy,

14:32.138 --> 14:34.840
just followed the trail
of insulin needles.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.877
I pictured her so much taller
and more muscular.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.079
You told them about me?

14:40.113 --> 14:41.447
You're not allowed
to talk about me.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.749
I'm so glad you came.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.119
I Foursquared it,
just hoping you'd see.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.520
Oh, hey, hey.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.455
Do-- do that thing
where you call me names.

14:49.488 --> 14:50.923
Ooh, yes, yes, yes.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.858
Like...

14:52.891 --> 14:54.026
titty-sucking bitch?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.897
Oh, I am going to
miss that, Gretchen.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.399
Actually, I'm--

15:00.433 --> 15:01.900
I'm leaving town.

15:01.934 --> 15:04.637
My boyfriend got into
the dramaturgy program

15:04.670 --> 15:06.539
at the University of Iowa.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.974
So, I feel like I need
to support him in that.

15:09.007 --> 15:10.576
He doesn't even have a car.

15:10.609 --> 15:11.910
He uses Justina's

15:11.944 --> 15:13.812
credit card when he
buys her presents.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.881
Okay, shut up, you
guys. He's on a path.

15:15.914 --> 15:17.716
You're choosing your boyfriend
over your career?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.119
Oh, that's a terrible example
for women.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.820
And diabetics!

15:22.921 --> 15:24.423
She's amazing.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.424
Can I have her?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.092
No! Look, we can still

15:27.126 --> 15:28.461
do Skype sessions, right?

15:28.494 --> 15:31.564
Iowa has got the
Internet, I think.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.998
Okay.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.970
I'm gonna show you
my titties, though,

15:38.003 --> 15:39.338
and then you're gonna
try to suck on them

15:39.372 --> 15:40.973
through the screen.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.575
Oh, my God.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.977
When you first came to me,
you were out of touch,

15:45.010 --> 15:48.447
even with your most rudimentary
behavioral patterns,

15:48.481 --> 15:50.115
but you have done the work

15:50.149 --> 15:51.784
and you have grown so much.

15:51.817 --> 15:53.952
And I'm proud of you.

15:56.689 --> 15:57.790
Bitch.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.758
Bitch to you, too, Gretchen.

16:02.961 --> 16:04.630
Mm-mm.

16:11.670 --> 16:12.671
*

16:21.547 --> 16:23.148
Hey!

16:23.182 --> 16:25.818
So, Doug Benson offered me
a full-time staff job

16:25.851 --> 16:27.152
and I wasn't gonna take it

16:27.186 --> 16:28.454
because I didn't
want you to feel bad,

16:28.487 --> 16:31.156
but instead,
I decided to keep it,

16:31.190 --> 16:32.358
because I'm becoming
a real person,

16:32.391 --> 16:33.626
which in turn,

16:33.659 --> 16:34.993
will make me a
better partner for you.

16:35.027 --> 16:35.994
Isn't that great?

16:36.028 --> 16:37.863
Uh, slow down.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.065
He offered you a staff job
and you were gonna

16:40.098 --> 16:41.800
turn it down because of me?
But

16:41.834 --> 16:43.636
I didn't. And now,

16:43.669 --> 16:46.272
I can support you
while things are tough.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.142
What?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.577
I'm not gonna make it.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.712
What?

16:53.746 --> 16:55.881
Why would you say that?
Because I'm not, Edgar.

16:55.914 --> 16:58.217
I'm not, okay? Face it.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.253
And the mere fact that you were
even thinking of turning down

17:00.286 --> 17:01.320
this amazing gig

17:01.354 --> 17:02.255
because you feel
sorry for me

17:02.288 --> 17:03.822
means you don't love me.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.758
You pity me.
That's not love.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.526
I don't want that.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.464
I'm moving back to
Jacksonville, Edgar.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.333
N-No. What?

17:14.367 --> 17:15.534
No, uh, then-then--

17:15.568 --> 17:17.435
then I'll come with you.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.338
I-I love Texas--

17:19.372 --> 17:21.607
the barbecues,
rodeos, South By.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.409
No, Florida.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.577
Oh, God.

17:24.609 --> 17:26.744
Oh, no. That's way worse.

17:26.779 --> 17:31.284
Look, I don't want you
to martyr yourself for me.

17:31.317 --> 17:34.186
I want you to stay here
and have your dream.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.421
But what about your dream?

17:37.456 --> 17:40.393
Not everybody gets their dream.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.062
Hey, if you know anybody

17:44.096 --> 17:46.499
who wants to take over my lease,
will you let me know?

17:48.434 --> 17:50.803
Thank you

17:50.836 --> 17:52.471
for being a wonderful boyfriend.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.906
I'm sorry.

17:55.173 --> 17:57.142
I failed.

17:57.175 --> 17:59.678
*

18:10.989 --> 18:12.124
- You've had enough?
- Who's hungry?

18:12.157 --> 18:13.959
You've had enough?
Who's hungry?

18:13.992 --> 18:14.993
No?
Who's hungry?

18:15.027 --> 18:15.994
Not hungry?

18:16.028 --> 18:18.464
So, um...

18:18.497 --> 18:20.566
is that formula only for babies,

18:20.599 --> 18:22.968
or can hungry big boys
get in on it, too?

18:24.269 --> 18:25.237
Ew.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.271
Don't you listen to him.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.240
Can I talk to you for a minute?

18:28.273 --> 18:30.476
Yeah.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.645
You got her?

18:32.678 --> 18:33.646
I got her.
Careful, careful.

18:33.679 --> 18:34.647
Hi, Tallulah.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.649
Who wants the blues?
No, no.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.251
No one wants that.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.086
* Weird poop in my diaper

18:41.119 --> 18:43.088
Just change her,
for God's sakes.

18:43.121 --> 18:45.758
* Spit-up on my chin.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.626
Can I live at your house again?

18:47.660 --> 18:50.095
You mean, until a week from now
when you change your mind

18:50.128 --> 18:53.466
and decide to move back in
with SpongeNerd SquareFace?

18:53.499 --> 18:55.968
It's over for real this time.

18:56.001 --> 18:57.436
He called me stupid.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.771
Can you believe that?

18:58.804 --> 19:00.673
What? No!

19:00.706 --> 19:03.476
You? What?

19:03.509 --> 19:06.178
I know.
Well, I just don't know

19:06.211 --> 19:08.614
if we have the ability
to house another baby,

19:08.647 --> 19:10.816
you know, even if it
is being raised

19:10.849 --> 19:13.686
by a financially
disadvantaged single mother.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.954
There's no baby.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.523
It'll just be me.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.362
Well, you would have to be
Tallulah's full-time nanny.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.632
Josefina quit because Vernon
kept shooting Nerf darts at her

19:26.665 --> 19:28.867
- while she vacuums.
- Yes! My kid just

19:28.901 --> 19:31.069
dropped a major duke!
Don't worry, Beck,

19:31.103 --> 19:32.871
I got this.
I have to admit,

19:32.905 --> 19:35.874
part of me is jealous.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.243
It's gonna be at least 18 years

19:38.276 --> 19:41.480
before I can divorce Vernon,

19:41.514 --> 19:43.382
cut my hair off,

19:43.416 --> 19:46.151
get a golden retriever,

19:46.184 --> 19:48.987
wear chunky knits,

19:49.021 --> 19:51.657
and just redo my kitchen.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.693
Over and over, forever.

19:54.727 --> 19:58.030
If I were you,
I would revel in my freedom.

19:58.063 --> 20:00.098
- Yeah.
- Babe,

20:00.132 --> 20:02.334
can I get a little help up here?
Freedom.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.438
Babe, baby, babe, help me!
Babe, help me!

20:12.210 --> 20:15.180
You know, so I realized
I can't live with Becca.

20:15.213 --> 20:17.049
I need freedom.

20:17.082 --> 20:19.718
Hey, are you
sure she's gone?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.790
I'm sorry.

20:24.823 --> 20:27.092
I liked that rando.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.094
I know.

20:29.127 --> 20:31.797
This is so weird.

20:31.830 --> 20:35.033
I'm still not even sure
what exactly happened.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.771
I never understand anything
that happens to me.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.206
Are you okay?

20:41.239 --> 20:43.642
I think, once she said it,

20:43.676 --> 20:45.410
part of me wanted her to go.

20:45.444 --> 20:48.246
She was kind of
bumming me out.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.117
How horrible is that of me?

20:52.150 --> 20:54.453
I mean, it's not
supposed to work like that.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.888
Right?

20:55.921 --> 20:57.289
And then it does.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.391
Are you gonna be okay here?

20:59.424 --> 21:01.126
Even though I'm alone and broke

21:01.159 --> 21:03.929
and live in the poorest
apartment in the world...

21:05.097 --> 21:07.099
...I feel good.
Good!

21:07.132 --> 21:10.603
I'll be by in the morning
to help you...

21:10.636 --> 21:12.437
spruce this place up.
Thanks, Edgar.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.139
I'll buy you a pizza...

21:14.172 --> 21:16.174
Hmm!
Oh, wait. I just remembered

21:16.208 --> 21:18.911
I don't have any money.
Can you bring me a pizza?

21:18.944 --> 21:20.145
No.

21:20.178 --> 21:22.147
Good boy.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.652
Jimmy!

21:59.685 --> 22:03.288
Jimmy!

22:03.321 --> 22:04.957
Oh, my God,

22:04.990 --> 22:07.726
it's so scary!

22:07.760 --> 22:09.394
Jimmy!

22:09.427 --> 22:11.296
What does it mean?

22:11.329 --> 22:14.533
Jimmy...

22:14.567 --> 22:17.035
I want to touch it.
Can I touch it?

22:17.069 --> 22:20.038
Oh, Jimmy, I'm gonna touch it.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.010
Jimmy!

22:25.043 --> 22:26.511
Jimmy!

22:26.545 --> 22:27.846
What are you doing?

22:27.880 --> 22:30.983
The world is absolutely lousy

22:31.016 --> 22:32.651
with people,

22:32.685 --> 22:35.854
and I hate them all.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.856
I hate everyone...

22:37.890 --> 22:39.491
but you.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.660
Yeah. I hate everyone else, too.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.662
Now, let's look for clues.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.598
You did something
really horrible for us.

22:45.631 --> 22:48.701
You went to therapy,
and for me you did this.

22:48.734 --> 22:53.205
And thus, you deserve
as grand a gesture in return.

22:53.238 --> 22:57.743
And since I am 100%
psychologically sound

22:57.776 --> 23:01.146
and do not need therapy
of any kind...

23:05.383 --> 23:06.952
Gretchen,

23:06.985 --> 23:10.923
extraordinary,
confounding Gretchen,

23:10.956 --> 23:14.292
she who emits more energy than

23:14.326 --> 23:16.962
a dying galaxy,
despite not washing her legs,

23:16.995 --> 23:19.431
together we transcend

23:19.464 --> 23:23.535
the... mundanity down there.

23:23.568 --> 23:27.372
Separate, it shall eventually
consume us and turn us

23:27.405 --> 23:30.809
as mundane as them,
and to allow that to happen

23:30.843 --> 23:33.879
simply because we were scared

23:33.912 --> 23:36.548
would be a criminal act.

23:36.581 --> 23:37.750
Wait, but the murder...?

23:37.783 --> 23:39.584
I made it up.

23:40.653 --> 23:43.321
The article?
The Twitter account?

23:43.355 --> 23:44.757
Me.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.424
The DUI checkpoint?

23:46.458 --> 23:49.227
Oh, no. That was real. No,
we were way lucky on that one.

23:56.368 --> 23:57.836
Jimmy,

23:57.870 --> 24:00.973
yeah, n... Wait.

24:01.006 --> 24:04.076
You haven't actually asked yet.
I am not doing that again.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.344
Will you marry me?

24:06.378 --> 24:08.513
Yes!

24:14.887 --> 24:18.623
You made a murder for me!

24:25.664 --> 24:27.099
Hey, uh, you ever

24:27.132 --> 24:29.601
boned down during
the Hollywood Bowl fireworks?

24:29.634 --> 24:30.969
I mean, of course.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.505
Yeah, me, too, but not
as an engaged person.

24:33.538 --> 24:34.973
Oh...

24:35.007 --> 24:38.010
I'll get us a hoodie
from the car to lie on.

24:38.043 --> 24:39.712
Hurry back.

24:39.745 --> 24:42.014
This fits, you know?

24:42.047 --> 24:44.482
You lost your dad, but...

24:44.516 --> 24:45.984
you gained me.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.453
We're a family.

24:48.486 --> 24:50.823
That's pretty cool, right?

24:50.856 --> 24:53.125
We're no longer just

24:53.158 --> 24:54.626
whatever we were.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.662
We're no longer... just us.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.998
We're a family now.

25:00.032 --> 25:03.201
*

25:07.072 --> 25:12.010
* If you go down to Heaven

25:13.245 --> 25:15.547
* You'll never come back

25:15.580 --> 25:17.249
Whoo!

25:19.718 --> 25:23.688
* In my opinion

25:23.722 --> 25:27.492
* You're

25:27.525 --> 25:30.462
* On the wrong track *

25:33.631 --> 25:36.101
* We'll always love you

25:36.134 --> 25:38.670
* But

25:38.703 --> 25:41.506
* That's not the point

25:46.945 --> 25:49.481
* Ooh...

25:53.819 --> 25:56.721
* Ooh

26:00.826 --> 26:04.162
* Throwing yourself away

26:05.998 --> 26:09.001
* Not even trying

26:14.272 --> 26:17.475
* Come on
* Come on *

26:17.509 --> 26:20.412
* You're

26:20.445 --> 26:24.049
* Lying

26:24.082 --> 26:27.685
* To me.
