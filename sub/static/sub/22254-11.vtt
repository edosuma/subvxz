WEBVTT

00:10.970 --> 00:12.488
What are you doing here?

00:12.931 --> 00:15.074
You said if I was in town
to give you a call.

00:15.808 --> 00:18.142
- Wanna get a drink?
- It's eight in the morning.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.770
It's 5:00 p.m. in Los Angeles.

00:19.771 --> 00:22.063
- That's not true.
- I don't know what time it is.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.942
When's the last time you slept?
You look like shit.

00:24.943 --> 00:27.545
Really? 'Cause you look like a million...

00:28.153 --> 00:31.114
- Yeah, let's get you back to my place.
- What about the store?

00:31.115 --> 00:33.718
What if somebody has an emergency
and they need more...

00:33.785 --> 00:35.076
turquoise shit?

00:35.077 --> 00:36.286
It's New Mexico.

00:36.287 --> 00:37.328
They'll find it.

00:37.329 --> 00:40.123
- It's really good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too.

00:40.124 --> 00:42.834
I can't wait for you
to meet Kyle and the kids.

00:42.835 --> 00:45.980
Kyle and the kids? Please tell me
that's the name of your band.

01:20.331 --> 01:22.290
So, who are you again?

01:22.291 --> 01:24.626
You were friends with Mom
when she lived in L.A.?

01:24.627 --> 01:28.254
Your mom never mentioned she used
to hang out with the BoJack Horseman?

01:28.255 --> 01:30.632
Star of screen and... book?

01:30.633 --> 01:33.384
- Wait, Mom lived in Los Angeles?
- Never came up?

01:33.385 --> 01:35.512
- All these years?
- It was a long time ago.

01:35.513 --> 01:38.139
Oh, gross. Mom, Trip has a boner again.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.058
- Trip.
- Trip, let's dial back the boners.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.726
- Gross.
- What? I can't help it.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.520
- Trip, ew.
- You are at the breakfast table

01:43.521 --> 01:46.272
with your parents, your big sister,
and an old man.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.734
- What could possibly be arousing you?
- Am I the old man?

01:49.735 --> 01:51.319
I don't understand how it works.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.823
I was just excited that I finished
the maze on the back of the cereal box.

01:54.824 --> 01:56.801
So, BoJack. What brings you to Tesuque?

01:56.826 --> 01:58.702
So, we're just gonna change
the subject

01:58.703 --> 02:01.412
and pretend Trip isn't being a huge perv
right now?

02:01.413 --> 02:03.040
Yeah, Penny, that's the plan.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.500
Talking about it makes it worse.
It likes attention.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.544
Charlotte told me if I was ever
in New Mexico

02:07.545 --> 02:10.128
- I should call her.
- But what are you doing in New Mexico?

02:10.130 --> 02:13.257
- Yeah, what are you doing in New Mexico?
- I, uh...

02:13.258 --> 02:16.594
You didn't drive all this way
just to see my mom, did you?

02:16.595 --> 02:18.221
No, of course not.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.181
That would be crazy,

02:20.182 --> 02:22.392
to come all this way just to see a woman

02:22.393 --> 02:25.186
I haven't had a real conversation with
in 30 years.

02:25.187 --> 02:28.356
- I mean, obviously, that would be crazy.
- Uh...

02:28.357 --> 02:31.442
- Because she has a family, which is great.
- Yeah.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.653
- You guys are great.
- Yeah.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.948
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.

02:36.949 --> 02:39.468
- Mm.
- On my way to see...

02:39.493 --> 02:40.952
- On your way to sea?
- Yes.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.204
To the sea. To the shining sea.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.248
Because I'm here to buy... a boat.

02:45.249 --> 02:49.086
- At the... Santa Fe Boat Show.
- I've never heard of a Santa Fe Boat Show.

02:49.087 --> 02:51.462
That's 'cause... it's a secret boat show.

02:51.463 --> 02:52.589
- Invitation-only.
- Huh.

02:52.590 --> 02:57.361
Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries
and big-time celebrities and... kings.

02:57.428 --> 02:58.428
- Wow.
- Hold up.

02:58.429 --> 03:02.015
If you live in Los Angeles,
which is right on the ocean,

03:02.016 --> 03:04.392
why would you drive all the way here
to go to a boat show

03:04.393 --> 03:07.979
- in the middle of landlocked New Mexico?
- Jeez, so many questions.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.107
What is this,
Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities,

03:10.108 --> 03:12.584
What Do They Know,
Do They Know Things, Let's Find Out?

03:13.611 --> 03:16.487
Oh, gotta take this.
It's my... boat... guy.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.156
- Hello?
- Okay, so I got Turtel...

03:18.157 --> 03:19.884
Hey, Knute.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.702
- You got any leads for me, boat-wise?
- What?

03:22.703 --> 03:23.912
Sounds perfect, Knute.

03:23.913 --> 03:26.497
- Now tell me, do we need a poop deck?
- Huh?

03:26.498 --> 03:29.250
- Well, if Leo has one, then I want one.
- BoJack...

03:29.251 --> 03:33.755
In fact, I want two, two poop decks.
Sorry about that. What's going on?

03:33.756 --> 03:35.882
- Where the hell are you?
- Tesuque.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.508
- Te-who-ka?
- Tesuque, New Mexico.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.719
- Outside Santa Fe.
- Are you te-stupid?

03:39.720 --> 03:43.347
If you don't get your ass back te-set,
you're gonna get te-sued.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.517
- Just get me a couple of days.
- For what? What are you doing there?

03:46.518 --> 03:47.978
I don't know, I just...

03:47.979 --> 03:49.329
This isn't what I expected.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.523
Well, I can probably stave them off
till Monday if you get pinkeye.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.233
- Can you get pinkeye?
- I have to go.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.611
Wait, BoJack, when are you coming back?

03:56.612 --> 03:58.571
Soon. Yep, I want the starboard

03:58.572 --> 04:00.364
- to be fully starboard.
- What?

04:00.365 --> 04:03.261
- And the port to be... also starboard.
- Huh?

04:03.285 --> 04:05.162
- Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
- Wait, BoJack...

04:05.163 --> 04:07.080
- Hey.
- I'm really glad you're here.

04:07.081 --> 04:09.124
Oh, yeah... uh, me, too.

04:09.125 --> 04:11.001
I hope this isn't weird for you.

04:11.002 --> 04:13.211
You know, me having a family and...

04:13.212 --> 04:14.629
Why would it be weird?

04:14.630 --> 04:17.482
At our age,
it's weird if you don't have a family.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.926
- I mean...
- Well, not for you.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.344
- No.
- 'Cause you've been busy.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.595
- Right.
- With your career.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.099
Sure, yeah,
my career has kept me super busy.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.893
Anyway, I know you're just in town
for the boat show,

04:28.894 --> 04:30.895
but seriously... make yourself at home.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.480
I really don't want to impose.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.899
If there's anything I can do
to help around here...

04:34.900 --> 04:38.486
Mom, Dad was supposed to take me driving
after school today,

04:38.487 --> 04:41.531
but now he's gotta take Trip
to his dumb-ass basketball game.

04:41.532 --> 04:44.676
- It's the quarter-finals.
- You'll just get a hard-on in the game.

04:44.702 --> 04:48.163
Now I will get a hard-on because
you made me think about it. Thanks a lot.

04:48.164 --> 04:51.457
- I'll take you driving this weekend.
- I need to practice every day.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.960
I'm the only senior
who still doesn't have a license.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.336
It's embarrassing.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.215
Well, I got the store,
and I already took the morning off,

04:58.216 --> 05:00.217
so unless you know any other adults...

05:00.218 --> 05:01.259
Can BoJack take me?

05:01.260 --> 05:02.177
- Huh?
- What?

05:02.178 --> 05:03.928
- I mean, he is an adult.
- Uh...

05:03.929 --> 05:05.847
Well, I mean, if it's okay with BoJack.

05:05.848 --> 05:08.599
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.871
Well, I guess I could make some time...
before the boat show.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.069
Keep your eyes on the road,
both hands on the wheel.

05:19.070 --> 05:21.154
- Okay.
- And don't text and drive,

05:21.155 --> 05:22.405
unless it's an emergency,

05:22.406 --> 05:25.801
like you have a really funny thing
that you just have to text someone.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.995
- Got it.
- So, let me ask you something. Tsk.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.914
Do your parents really love each other,

05:30.915 --> 05:33.250
or is it
a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?

05:33.251 --> 05:35.085
What? Why would you ask me that?

05:35.086 --> 05:37.021
I don't know. Just making conversation.

05:37.088 --> 05:40.048
- Why do we keep passing the same house?
- No, I don't. Shut up.

05:40.049 --> 05:43.176
You shut up. What's the story?
Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?

05:43.177 --> 05:44.928
College kid that gives you Adderall?

05:44.929 --> 05:46.446
Okay, fine.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.514
That's Diego Mendoza's house.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.308
He's just this stupid guy.

05:50.309 --> 05:53.144
He's in my calculus class,
and sometimes we'll do this thing

05:53.145 --> 05:55.688
where he goes, "Hey,"
and then I go, "Hey."

05:55.689 --> 05:58.149
Then he goes, "What's the homework?"
and I tell him.

05:58.150 --> 06:01.586
It's not like a big deal or anything,
but it's like this thing we do.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.422
- Cool thing.
- So, anyway...

06:04.240 --> 06:06.699
My best friend, Alison F.
was talking to Rachel Kaplan.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.600
Do I really need
to know these names?

06:08.619 --> 06:10.494
Rachel heard from Ray-Ray
and the Bean

06:10.495 --> 06:12.472
that Diego said
if prom happened right now

06:12.539 --> 06:14.832
he'd want to go with Ali Sandler,
and I'm like,

06:14.833 --> 06:17.418
"Yeah, pfft, okay, dude."
You know what I mean?

06:17.419 --> 06:19.921
You know I don't know
any of these people, right?

06:19.922 --> 06:22.673
But then he said
since prom's not for another two months,

06:22.674 --> 06:25.802
he could "foresee a situation"
where he would want to go with me,

06:25.803 --> 06:29.139
because he knows I'm a real girl
who's mostly chill.

06:29.140 --> 06:32.183
If you're so mostly chill,
why do you keep driving by his house?

06:32.184 --> 06:35.228
In case he comes out,
to, like, check the mail or something.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.939
I'll get out of the car and be like,
"That's so funny.

06:37.940 --> 06:39.398
I was just going for a drive."

06:39.399 --> 06:42.152
And he'll be like, "Oh, hey."
And I'll be like, "Hey."

06:42.153 --> 06:45.571
- 'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.
- That's the whole plan?

06:45.572 --> 06:49.159
Well, it's better than your plan
for buying a boat in New Mexico.

06:49.160 --> 06:52.679
Dude, what are you really doing here?

06:54.539 --> 06:59.210
I didn't... like the person I was in L.A.

06:59.211 --> 07:02.755
And I didn't know where else to go.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.216
- Please do not tell your parents.
- Well, I won't,

07:05.217 --> 07:06.759
but I think people are gonna notice

07:06.760 --> 07:09.053
if you go to a boat show
and don't come back with a boat.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.390
Oh, my God, there he is. Get down!

07:12.391 --> 07:13.975
- Oh, my God. Oh!
- What are you doing?

07:13.976 --> 07:16.102
- What happened to your plan?
- Oh! I panicked.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.497
I didn't know
he'd be wearing a tank top.

07:21.608 --> 07:25.003
- Don't tell my parents I crashed your car.
- Yeah, deal.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.284
- They didn't even put me in.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.137
You did some great cheering
from the bench,

07:33.162 --> 07:35.496
and for someone who never plays,
you sweat a lot.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.082
- Maybe they'll put me in next game.
- Sure, they will.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.959
No way they'll do that.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.171
- What the...?
- Huh?

07:43.172 --> 07:44.797
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

07:44.798 --> 07:46.132
What a boat.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.426
- Can I go on your boat?
- I don't see what's stopping you.

07:48.427 --> 07:51.679
Yeah! Woo-hoo! I'm going on a boat!
I got my way!

07:51.680 --> 07:52.763
Where's your car?

07:52.764 --> 07:55.159
I junked it.
Who needs a car when you got a boat?

07:55.184 --> 07:58.019
- Uh... well...
- Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.

07:58.020 --> 08:01.398
On a boat!
Think of the amount of floating!

08:01.399 --> 08:03.107
Please stay out of the bedroom.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.567
- Does she have a name?
- Who?

08:04.568 --> 08:08.238
- The boat? It does not.
- Come on. You gotta give her a name.

08:08.239 --> 08:10.448
You should call her the Escape From L.A.

08:10.449 --> 08:13.368
That actually is a good name for it,
the nongendered object.

08:13.369 --> 08:15.179
Oh, she's a good girl.

08:15.204 --> 08:18.331
I can tell,
she's a good girl, isn't she?

08:18.332 --> 08:21.459
- Or are you a bad girl?
- Are you flirting with my boat right now?

08:21.460 --> 08:24.503
No, just kidding around.
I'm kind of the comedian of the family.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.006
- Mind if I get on top of her?
- Knock yourself out.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.591
Dad, don't be gross.

08:28.592 --> 08:31.177
- Wow, you really got a boat.
- Yeah, sure did.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.136
So, does that mean you're leaving?

08:33.138 --> 08:34.722
Oh, I, uh...

08:34.722 --> 08:39.059
Yeah, I guess, uh... I guess I did...
do what I came here to do.

08:39.061 --> 08:42.938
You don't have to go right away, right?
At least stay till the end of the weekend.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.691
- Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.
- Oh, it's no bother.

08:45.692 --> 08:49.862
And at least now you have your own bed.
Besides... heh, everyone here loves you.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.364
Uh, everyone?

08:51.365 --> 08:53.925
Don't use the bathroom.
It'll end up in the driveway.

08:53.992 --> 08:57.429
- Too late.
- Seriously, stay as long as you want.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.958
- What?
- BoJack, great news.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.627
Do you still want to go to New York?
Because Jill Pill...

09:04.628 --> 09:06.337
Jill Pill? I don't care about this.

09:06.338 --> 09:09.299
Okay, moving on. Do you remember
when we were at Herb's funeral

09:09.300 --> 09:11.634
- and you told me...?
- Whatever it is, I don't care.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.886
Oh, there's a kitchen!
Can we make pizza bagels?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.513
Yeah, family dinner on the boat.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.724
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back
on set Monday.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.103
What? How long do I have
to keep putting out fires for you?

09:22.104 --> 09:24.623
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.
Just let them burn.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.024
- What?
- I think I might be here a while.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.668
Listen, I...

09:33.157 --> 09:35.366
Well, who's getting seasick?

09:36.618 --> 09:38.637
Just kidding.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.747
It's such an eyesore.

09:41.748 --> 09:45.394
Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely,
they'll move the boat.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.716
BoJack?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.945
- Yeah?
- Supper's ready.

09:54.970 --> 09:58.306
So, I had another meeting today
with the Drama Chair at SFCC.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.224
They're gonna offer me a position.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.144
- What? That's amazing.
- Oh, that's cool. Congratulations.

10:03.145 --> 10:07.148
There's a real stick-in-the-mud dean there
who doesn't like my in-your-face style.

10:07.149 --> 10:12.111
If I know me, it might lead
to some pretty zany misadventures.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.946
Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.

10:13.947 --> 10:18.075
It's funny you brought up the Brussels
sprouts, because I think they're terrible.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.745
I'm just kidding around.
These are great, hon.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.291
Penny, did you hear my bit
about the Brussels sprouts?

10:25.292 --> 10:28.252
A bit is what they call a joke
in show business.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.795
- Right, BoJack?
- That's right.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.507
String a bunch of those together
and you got yourself a riff.

10:32.508 --> 10:35.885
You're not funny, Dad.
Your jokes are never funny.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.970
Okay... I think someone's in a mood.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.597
Oh, my God. I'm not in a mood.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.391
Whatever. Get bent.

10:41.392 --> 10:43.601
I hate my life. I can't wait to be dead.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.062
I'll talk to her.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.355
Everyone said for months

10:47.356 --> 10:49.458
- that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.
- Yeah?

10:49.525 --> 10:52.443
- But he keeps not doing it.
- That is so typical Diego.

10:52.444 --> 10:55.530
So, I thought, okay,
if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.198
- Way to take initiative.
- Oh. Rookie mistake.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.949
So, I asked him and he said no.

10:58.950 --> 11:02.721
And then this other girl, Lyla K.,
came up to him and was just like, "Hey."

11:02.746 --> 11:05.456
And he was like, "Hey."
And that's our thing.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.708
Well, I don't want to tell tales
out of school,

11:07.709 --> 11:11.879
but this Lyla K. character
sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.674
Thank you, that is exactly what she is.
It's weird that nobody talks about it.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.386
Well, you know, sometimes it's nice
to not have a date,

11:18.387 --> 11:19.970
- because you can actually...
- Mom.

11:19.971 --> 11:23.807
I can't go to the prom without a date.
It's not like when you were in high school

11:23.808 --> 11:26.394
- and you'd go to your sock hops.
- Do you think

11:26.395 --> 11:29.439
- I went to high school in the '50s?
- Penny, hey, I got an idea.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.981
- You should take me to the prom.
- Huh?

11:30.982 --> 11:32.858
Everybody loves having BoJack around.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.026
What? Why?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.737
Think about it. If you went with Diego,
you'd be nervous.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.531
"Does he like me? Am I cool?"

11:38.532 --> 11:41.492
But with me you can just relax
and enjoy yourself.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.762
Diego will see you
have a good time without him,

11:43.787 --> 11:45.496
and that'll make him super jealous.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.998
So, he'll come up to you,
and he'll say, "Hey."

11:47.999 --> 11:49.750
And then you say, "Hey."

11:49.751 --> 11:51.752
- Oh, that's so cold.
- Right?

11:51.753 --> 11:54.004
- Wait...
- Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.382
- How is that cold?
- Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?"

11:56.383 --> 11:58.926
And you'll say,
"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."

11:58.927 --> 12:01.887
And then... never dance with him.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.181
- That'll show him.
- Wait... I'm sorry.

12:04.182 --> 12:06.934
- Don't you want to dance with Diego?
- Stop poking holes, Charlotte.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.437
- This is a great plan.
- Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.665
Hey, Dad, BoJack's taking me to prom!

12:12.107 --> 12:16.461
Oh, yeah, well,
that's definitely the better idea.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.698
Okay, everyone smile. Real big.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.033
- Cheese.
- I think we have enough pictures.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.554
Oh, come on, it's your first prom.
Indulge us.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.205
Taking pictures before prom
is so bourgeois.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.457
And who are you again?

12:29.458 --> 12:31.959
- I'm Maddy.
- Maddy's my best friend.

12:31.960 --> 12:36.422
- I thought Alison F. was your best friend.
- That was like three best friends ago.

12:36.423 --> 12:40.009
You were best friends
with Alison F.?

12:40.010 --> 12:43.012
- No.
- Hey, BoJack, I'm Pete.

12:43.013 --> 12:47.057
But they call me Pete Repeat
because I always say everything twice.

12:47.058 --> 12:50.060
- Everything?
- Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.496
- Okay.
- Ah, damn.

12:51.522 --> 12:54.064
I forgot to say that twice, didn't I?
Usually I do it.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.041
Cool.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.531
Wow, Ray-Ray and the Bean
are already posting pics on Instagram.

13:01.532 --> 13:03.366
- What?
- Hashtag much?

13:03.367 --> 13:04.367
Let me see.

13:04.368 --> 13:06.327
Whoa, hold on. Responsible adult.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.179
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing.

13:08.205 --> 13:11.207
- Hand it over.
- Fine.

13:11.208 --> 13:15.586
Ugh. Red Bull and vodka? What are you, 12?
You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.

13:15.587 --> 13:18.565
Do they teach you anything in school?
Make a left at the light.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.900
- Where are we going?
- I'll get you some bourbon.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.969
And you'll cut it with water.
That way you don't get hungover.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.012
Wait, really?

13:25.013 --> 13:27.765
If you're gonna drink,
you should be smart about it.

13:27.766 --> 13:30.768
Awesome. Wait.
How many times did I just say "awesome"?

13:30.769 --> 13:33.145
Was it twice or was it once?
Ah, it was probably twice.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.540
Yeah, it's twice. Pete Repeat.

13:41.196 --> 13:44.741
- Ugh. It burns.
- Yeah, 'cause it's not a juice box.

13:44.742 --> 13:45.949
You want some?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.284
- No, thanks.
- Pussy.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.369
I'm driving.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.387
Well, more for me.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.723
This prom is really bourgeois.

13:51.749 --> 13:55.209
- Lyla K. is so pretty.
- Shut up. She's got nothing on you.

13:55.210 --> 13:59.004
Why is nobody dancing?
We gotta get this party started.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.215
Beat it, Poindexter.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.259
- Poindexter?
- It's a nerd reference...

14:03.260 --> 14:04.444
- Just beat it.
- Ah!

14:04.469 --> 14:05.469
Huh?

14:05.470 --> 14:06.596
- Hey!
- What's the big idea?

14:06.597 --> 14:10.224
Why is there an adult
at our high school prom?

14:10.225 --> 14:12.476
All right, folks.
We're taking it back to 1991,

14:12.477 --> 14:16.188
when a new funky-fresh dance craze
took this nation by storm.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.856
- All right.
- I'm listening.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.568
As a teen, I'm open to new experiences.

14:20.569 --> 14:24.781
Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat,
and here... we... go. Waka waka.

14:24.782 --> 14:27.366
Now boys and girls,
if you wanna do the BoJack,

14:27.367 --> 14:29.744
- take your hands and put them on your...
- Boo!

14:29.745 --> 14:31.805
- This sucks.
- This guy's bad.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.290
God, no! This is not
the immediate praise I expected.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.336
This prom sucks.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.504
You can say that again.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.715
- I know.
- My flask got empty.

14:42.716 --> 14:46.176
Can we be back to the car,
so, for more get for put in it?

14:46.177 --> 14:48.345
Or we could go back to the car
and just leave.

14:48.346 --> 14:51.974
- You can't just leave the prom.
- Of course you can. You're young.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.601
You can do whatever you want.

14:53.602 --> 14:54.977
That's what they never tell you

14:54.978 --> 14:57.605
until it's too late.
You don't have to be here.

14:57.606 --> 15:00.357
Yeah, is right. Society is everywhere.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.360
- Society.
- Well, what else are we gonna do?

15:03.361 --> 15:05.863
I'd say it's time to get down,
time to hit the town.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.574
Is that a lyric
from that "Do the BoJack" song?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.635
Just get in the car.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.106
Okay, one... two... three.

15:26.050 --> 15:29.136
Wow. That is so beautiful.

15:30.305 --> 15:32.598
Hey, you wanna climb up
on the water tower?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.099
We could see the whole city.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.226
Yeah, I wanna go.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.936
Oh.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.396
Oh, careful there, Maddy.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.207
Actually, I'm gonna stay right here.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.251
This is nice.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.571
Wow, how'd you think to do all this?

15:47.572 --> 15:49.948
I don't know. It just came to me.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.326
I'm really glad we left that stupid prom,

15:52.327 --> 15:55.221
but I'm kind of bummed
we didn't get to dance.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.331
Well, you wanna dance?

15:57.332 --> 15:59.124
Yes, hold on.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.584
Got it, okay.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.881
It's buffering.

16:04.882 --> 16:08.175
Buffering still, buffering.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.303
This night has been... so perfect.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.490
You know, you look just like your mother.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.226
Guys?

16:17.227 --> 16:19.746
I think you should come down here.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.606
She's still breathing,
but she won't wake up.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.442
She just had too much to drink.
Take her back to your place.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.570
- She can spend the night.
- Maddy, come on.

16:27.571 --> 16:30.447
No, look, my cousin had a friend
who passed out like this,

16:30.448 --> 16:33.367
and she died of alcohol poisoning, man.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.537
I really think we should get Maddy
to a hospital, to a hospital.

16:36.538 --> 16:39.766
Did you see what I did there?
That's why they call me Pete Repeat.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.185
BoJack, what do we do?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.007
- Society.
- Careful.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.342
- I'm being careful.
- Okay.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.094
- Lock the wheels.
- Watch her head.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.847
Maddy's gonna be just fine.
They'll know what to do here.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.014
Pete, you're in charge.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.016
- Penny and I are gonna take off.
- What?

16:58.017 --> 17:01.437
You don't want too many people around
in a hospital setting.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.773
If anyone asks,
tell them we left the dance early,

17:03.774 --> 17:06.191
and you don't know
where Maddy got the whiskey.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.108
Why?

17:07.109 --> 17:09.862
It's one thing if a bunch of kids
get drunk on prom night,

17:09.863 --> 17:12.949
but if there's an adult there,
I was supposed to be responsible,

17:12.950 --> 17:15.117
and then the whole thing feels
kind of creepy.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.786
Are you sure she's gonna be okay?

17:16.787 --> 17:18.621
- I don't know, BoJack.
- Pete.

17:18.622 --> 17:21.058
I'm the adult here,
and I need you to listen to me.

17:21.124 --> 17:24.041
Penny and I left early.
You don't know who gave Maddy whiskey.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.167
Are we clear on this?

17:25.169 --> 17:27.212
I need you to be 100 percent with me here.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.338
Uh...

17:28.339 --> 17:30.466
Just listen to him.
He knows what he's doing.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.760
It's gonna be okay.
Where did Maddy get the alcohol from?

17:33.762 --> 17:35.888
I... I don't know.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.891
And what happened to your friends
BoJack and Penny?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.977
They left early.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.812
See, that's not so hard.

17:42.813 --> 17:45.439
You're doing the right thing.
Don't forget that.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.276
- Okay.
- Is it okay?

17:49.277 --> 17:51.194
Or "okay" okay?

17:51.195 --> 17:54.323
- Uh... "okay" okay.
- All right, that's what I thought.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.117
You're the future of America!
Go, Penny! Go, go, go!

18:00.163 --> 18:02.766
- She's gonna be okay, right?
- She'll be fine.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.082
It's a part of growing up.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.645
And we did the right thing back there,
you think?

18:07.671 --> 18:10.589
I...
Look, sometimes when you're an adult,

18:10.590 --> 18:12.800
the right thing
isn't always the best thing.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.111
Well...

18:14.970 --> 18:17.137
I had a really good time tonight.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.097
Even with all the craziness.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.058
This was really special.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.225
I'm glad.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.354
You know, everyone always treats me
like a kid.

18:25.355 --> 18:29.107
You're the first grown-up I've ever met
who actually treats me like...

18:29.108 --> 18:30.943
you know, a person.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.988
So, thanks. Mwah.

18:33.989 --> 18:35.739
- Well, you're welcome, Penny.
- Mm...

18:35.740 --> 18:38.408
- Whoa, Penny, come on.
- If you want to do it, I'm ready.

18:38.409 --> 18:41.161
I have condoms in my room.
I can put one on with my mouth.

18:41.162 --> 18:43.890
- With your mouth?
- I put one on a banana in health class.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.375
With your mouth?
What kind of health class...?

18:46.376 --> 18:49.003
Look, you are an amazing person,
but you're 17.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.463
Which is the legal age of consent
in New Mexico.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.798
Okay, that's not...

18:52.799 --> 18:55.551
And I didn't drink tonight,
so everything's totally legal.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.470
- Penny, no.
- It's okay. I want this.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.531
No, you think you do, but...

19:01.307 --> 19:02.742
You don't know what you want.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.603
Oh, God.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.064
This is so dumb.

19:08.065 --> 19:10.917
- No, Penny, don't...
- I'll see you tomorrow.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.116
Hey.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.702
- What'd you do with my daughter?
- She had a big night.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.747
She was falling asleep on the ride home.
Where are the boys?

19:24.748 --> 19:27.184
Trip's at a friend's house
and Kyle's asleep.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.545
- You know you can get your own, right?
- Hey, do you remember that time

19:31.546 --> 19:34.214
you, me and Herb let those balloons go
over Studio City?

19:34.215 --> 19:37.593
Oh, yeah. Didn't we attach glow sticks
to them or something?

19:37.594 --> 19:38.969
- Yeah.
- Ooh. That was really bad

19:38.970 --> 19:39.929
for the environment.

19:39.930 --> 19:41.805
- True, but...
- A seagull could've choked

19:41.806 --> 19:44.767
- on one of those balloons.
- But it's a nice memory, right?

19:44.768 --> 19:46.393
It was a fun night.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.520
We had a lot of fun nights.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.941
Before you left town,
you told me L.A. was a tar pit.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.358
- Do you remember?
- Oh, God.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.570
I said so many things when I was young.
I thought I was so deep.

19:56.571 --> 20:00.574
- Well, do you still think it's true?
- Do I think L.A. is a tar pit?

20:00.575 --> 20:01.951
No.

20:01.952 --> 20:03.953
No, I think you're the tar pit.

20:03.954 --> 20:06.538
- Me?
- No, not "you" you.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.266
I'm just saying, like...

20:08.291 --> 20:11.251
It doesn't matter where you are,
it's who you are,

20:11.252 --> 20:14.046
and that's not gonna change
whether you're in California

20:14.047 --> 20:17.275
or Maine or New Mexico.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.635
You know, you can't escape... you.

20:19.636 --> 20:24.598
- Ugh. Now you sound like my mother.
- No, what? No, I don't.

20:27.518 --> 20:30.479
- I don't know what to do, Charlotte.
- About what?

20:30.480 --> 20:33.398
I keep... making these bad decisions.

20:33.399 --> 20:36.669
- And hurting people.
- Well...

20:36.694 --> 20:39.738
- Can I tell you a joke?
- Is it a long joke with no punch line?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.239
- No.
- Then go ahead.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.535
Guy goes into the doctor's office.
Says, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this."

20:45.536 --> 20:46.996
You know what the doctor says?

20:46.997 --> 20:49.557
- "Don't do that."
- Yeah.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.751
- That's actually... good advice.
- And you know what else?

20:52.752 --> 20:55.587
The doctor in that story was a woman.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.880
What?!

21:05.765 --> 21:07.891
Oh. BoJack, um...

21:07.892 --> 21:10.727
- I think you got the wrong idea.
- Let's go.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.896
- Let's get out of here right now.
- No, BoJack.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.332
You and me, this is real.

21:14.357 --> 21:16.942
- You know this is real.
- My husband is right upstairs.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.611
I don't care about your husband.
All that matters is us.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.405
- Don't do this, BoJack.
- I know you feel it, too.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.825
So many times in my life
I've done the wrong thing,

21:24.826 --> 21:26.202
but this is the right thing,

21:26.203 --> 21:28.411
and I have never been more sure
of anything.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.747
I've wasted so much time sitting
on my hands

21:30.748 --> 21:32.976
and imagining what could have been.

21:33.001 --> 21:36.395
Tell me you don't feel the same.
Tell me you haven't thought about it.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.133
- I think you should go.
- Okay.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.051
- Tomorrow.
- Charlotte...

21:42.052 --> 21:44.761
I have worked very hard to build this life
for myself.

21:44.762 --> 21:45.971
I am happy here.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.640
And you just roll into my life
like a hurricane.

21:48.641 --> 21:52.186
Why? Because we knew each other
for five minutes 30 years ago?

21:52.187 --> 21:53.562
- I don't know you.
- You do.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.856
I don't. And you don't know me.

21:55.857 --> 21:58.650
No, please.
These last few months have been amazing.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.777
- I love you, your family and this town.
- Stop.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.529
- I never wanted to hurt...
- BoJack...

22:02.530 --> 22:06.033
I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have.
We can pretend it didn't happen.

22:06.034 --> 22:09.053
- Everything can go back to normal, but...
- No, no, stop. No.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.580
Please, don't make me go back to L.A.

22:11.581 --> 22:15.101
I don't care where you go, BoJack,
but I can't have you around here.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.854
You make me too sad.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.439
Okay.

22:25.262 --> 22:26.529
What are you doing here?

22:26.554 --> 22:29.448
I know what I want, BoJack.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.745
Go to bed, Penny.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.553
Wait, what?

22:57.460 --> 22:59.979
Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

23:08.721 --> 23:09.721
- No.
- Mom.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.514
- Charlotte.
- Penny, go to your room.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.910
- We didn't even do anything.
- Now, Penny.

23:17.772 --> 23:21.358
- Charlotte, I am so sorry...
- Don't. Don't you dare.

23:21.359 --> 23:25.779
If you are not out of my driveway
in 30 minutes, I will call the police.

23:25.780 --> 23:29.950
And if you ever try to contact me
or my family again,

23:29.951 --> 23:32.387
I will fucking kill you.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.156
Hey.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.723
Hey.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.392
You're still here?

24:36.393 --> 24:39.287
Yep, still here.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.586
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
