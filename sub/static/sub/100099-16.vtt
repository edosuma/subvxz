00:01.305 --> 00:03.220
Previously on
Supergirl...

00:03.264 --> 00:06.267
People use our VR
to cope with trauma
they experience.

00:06.310 --> 00:08.965
Your failsafe failed.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.141
I assure you,
this glitch will be fixed.

00:11.185 --> 00:14.057
You just rest easy, Mr. Bates.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.928
I've got you now.

00:15.972 --> 00:16.973
They found Dad.

00:17.974 --> 00:18.757
He's dead.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.327
I still can't believe it.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.027
Of all the places for Jeremiah
to hide out,

00:27.679 --> 00:28.550
the Peruvian Andes.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.248
Yeah. It's where he found you.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.294
Clearly, that place
meant a lot to him.

00:33.337 --> 00:34.773
He was doing humanitarian work?

00:34.817 --> 00:37.080
In a refugee camp.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.126
Helping displaced aliens.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.954
After everything
that Jeremiah endured,

00:41.998 --> 00:43.739
it's hard to believe
he died of a cardiac arrest.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.133
It's surreal.

00:48.004 --> 00:49.310
Hey, how are you,
uh, how're you doing?

00:49.353 --> 00:50.572
I'm sad.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.315
It's painful to know
he's really gone.

00:54.358 --> 00:57.100
But you know what?
I'm also relieved to know

00:57.144 --> 00:58.754
he was a good man that...

01:00.190 --> 01:01.452
That brought me some peace.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.454
That's one thing
I never doubted...

01:03.498 --> 01:05.325
is that Jeremiah
loved his daughters.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.504
That's what Eliza
said to me this morning.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.988
Kara.
I'm so sorry.

01:16.032 --> 01:18.556
Thanks, Kelly.
I'm so glad Alex has you.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.342
So where is she?
Are you guys ready?

01:21.385 --> 01:22.473
I'm not going.

01:22.517 --> 01:23.909
Uh...

01:23.953 --> 01:25.737
And you can spare me
the big accusing eyes, Kara,

01:25.781 --> 01:26.912
I'm not changing my mind.

01:26.956 --> 01:27.957
Excuse me.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.003
Um... Alex,
I don't understand.

01:31.047 --> 01:33.484
You were with me last night
when we made the arrangements.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.095
I never said
that I was participating.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.185
I... I know you're in pain.

01:38.228 --> 01:40.143
-I'm not in pain.
-Of course you are.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.189
Okay, stop telling me
how I feel.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.800
Okay, then you tell me
how you feel.

01:44.843 --> 01:48.369
Tell me why you're refusing
to go to your father's funeral.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.980
Because I don't feel the need
to bury a man

01:51.023 --> 01:52.808
who has been
dead to me for years.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.592
Jeremiah
was changing his ways.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.333
He was helping people,
making amends.

01:56.377 --> 01:57.552
Well, not to me.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.945
He had to live in secrecy
for his safety.

01:59.989 --> 02:01.077
Right.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.687
After leaving Cadmus,
did you think

02:02.731 --> 02:04.211
he was just gonna be able to
call us whenever he felt like?

02:04.254 --> 02:06.387
I am the one
who held out hope for him.

02:06.430 --> 02:07.997
I am the one that said
that he was good,

02:08.039 --> 02:10.217
and that Cadmus was forcing him
to kill people.

02:10.259 --> 02:11.740
And he helped you escape.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.046
And then he disappeared. Again.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.178
Just like that!

02:15.222 --> 02:16.353
Alex, he's still your father.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.964
You should be at his burial.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.183
Look, the man that I loved

02:20.227 --> 02:23.273
hasn't been a father
to me in years.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.536
And... and, yes.

02:25.580 --> 02:28.191
Yes, we were so close

02:28.235 --> 02:31.368
that we could just...
we could finish
each other's sentences.

02:32.630 --> 02:36.025
But his obsession
with keeping you safe

02:36.068 --> 02:37.461
changed all of it.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.855
Nothing else mattered to him,
the least of all me.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.291
That is not true.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.640
Come on, Kara.

02:42.684 --> 02:45.077
He treated you like
you were some golden girl,

02:45.121 --> 02:49.821
and of course
you have love for him,
and I totally respect that.

02:49.865 --> 02:54.348
But he treated me like
I wasn't even worth his time.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.657
Okay.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.485
So, what do you
want me to tell Eliza?

03:03.313 --> 03:05.620
-I don't care.
-You don't care.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.665
You don't care what I tell
our grieving mother?

03:07.709 --> 03:11.147
I have spent my entire life
protecting this whole family,

03:11.191 --> 03:12.453
and I will not do it again.

03:16.457 --> 03:18.676
She is all yours, Kelly.
I'm not dealing with this.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.245
People
grieve differently,

03:22.289 --> 03:24.682
and Alex is reeling.

03:24.726 --> 03:27.381
Okay, you guys go to Midvale,
I'll talk to her.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.296
-There's still time.
-Call me if you need any help.

03:29.339 --> 03:30.384
Okay, thank you.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.095
-It's a bit early for that.
-Don't.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.097
Look, I get it.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.838
You know I have had
a lot of loss.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.143
I know how you feel.

03:51.187 --> 03:53.233
You have no idea...

03:54.669 --> 03:55.452
how I feel.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.543
I have mourned
the loss of my father

04:00.544 --> 04:01.763
multiple times.

04:03.547 --> 04:09.205
You have no idea
this stabbing pain here.

04:10.554 --> 04:16.343
I'm losing him over and over
and over again.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.954
And I really...

04:19.998 --> 04:23.741
I really can't tolerate
being psychoanalyzed

04:23.785 --> 04:26.178
by my girlfriend right now.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.355
-I'm sorry.
-So rather than your apology,

04:28.398 --> 04:31.314
what I want
is to be left alone.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.141
Okay.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.492
I will give you space.

04:35.536 --> 04:38.321
But just know
that I love you

04:38.365 --> 04:41.106
and I'm here
for you unconditionally.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.544
-And when you're ready,
just call.

04:45.023 --> 04:45.981
You got it.

04:57.035 --> 04:59.473
But now
we want you to know
you're in good hands.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.739
Hope, help
and compassion for all.

05:04.782 --> 05:05.957
- Call us--

06:15.070 --> 06:16.114
Let's go punch things.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.093
Hey, Kelly.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.486
Will.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.488
I heard about Kara
and Alex's dad.

06:42.489 --> 06:43.446
I'm sorry for all of you.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.317
Thanks.

06:45.361 --> 06:46.318
Hey, shouldn't you guys be
getting on the road

06:46.362 --> 06:47.319
for the funeral about now?

06:47.363 --> 06:48.712
Yeah, we should.

06:48.756 --> 06:51.323
But things are complicated
with her and her dad.

06:51.367 --> 06:54.588
So she says she doesn't
wanna go to Midvale today.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.459
-That's rough.
-Yeah, but there's still time.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.026
So I am giving her space

06:58.069 --> 07:00.507
and hoping
she changes her mind.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.466
Which leaves me here
with nothing to do but worry.

07:05.076 --> 07:08.515
Well, if you are looking
to pass the time,

07:08.558 --> 07:09.994
-I could use a favor.
-Yeah.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.608
In the past three weeks,

07:14.651 --> 07:17.654
Lex Luthor has rushed
32 satellites

07:17.698 --> 07:20.483
through approval by the FAA
and launched them into space.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.659
Each of their orbits
placed them directly
above a city

07:22.703 --> 07:25.923
that Lex himself is visiting
on this Obsidian world tour.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.536
So you're wondering
what the satellites have to do

07:29.579 --> 07:31.842
-with the Obsidian
Platinum's launch.
-Mmm.

07:31.886 --> 07:34.366
Nothing, as far as I'm aware.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.543
Platinum operates off
of booster towers.

07:36.586 --> 07:39.502
So, whatever Lex's business
is with the satellites,

07:39.546 --> 07:41.722
it has nothing to do
with us.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.375
But you're still
skeptical of him?

07:43.419 --> 07:46.117
Yeah, I worry about what
Lex is doing with our platform.

07:46.161 --> 07:48.076
And Alex is skeptical, too.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.557
So I'm keeping an eye
out for anything

07:50.600 --> 07:54.517
that might prove that
Lex isn't the hero
that everyone thinks.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.738
Still, you don't think
he's doing anything wrong here?

07:57.781 --> 07:58.869
Not that I can tell.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.523
Since Luthor Corp came aboard

08:00.567 --> 08:02.525
the only glitch
involved a failsafe.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.353
And that was a fluke.

08:04.396 --> 08:08.531
A lone hacker, Richard Bates,
exploited it for his own ends.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.665
You don't think there's
any chance this Richard
was working with Lex?

08:14.624 --> 08:15.669
What would Alex say?

08:16.757 --> 08:21.413
That with Lex,
anything is possible.

08:37.472 --> 08:38.822
Man, this guy's really great.

08:40.432 --> 08:41.825
Hey, Supergirl,

08:41.869 --> 08:43.523
I haven't seen you
in VR before.

08:44.436 --> 08:45.742
Treasure Hunter Tilly.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.004
I'm a participant like you.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.137
Oh. Oh, cool.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.574
Most of these people are bots.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.621
The simulation maps your brain,

08:54.664 --> 08:55.926
so it'll populate your world

08:55.970 --> 08:57.580
with things that feel
familiar to you.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.974
People you know,
places you've been.

09:00.017 --> 09:03.368
Well, they do look
very, very real.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.806
All you gotta do
is check the neck.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.155
If you see three stripes,

09:07.198 --> 09:09.810
that means they're
a non-player character.

09:09.853 --> 09:12.595
The ones without stripes,
we're the realies.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.206
Right. Well, thank you, Tilly.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.686
Call me Bonnie.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.384
Alex.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.996
My sister Jill is Supergirl's
biggest fan in real life.

09:22.692 --> 09:23.650
Oh, that's great.

09:25.695 --> 09:28.089
So are you blowing off
steam playing hero,

09:28.132 --> 09:30.265
or working something out?

09:31.658 --> 09:34.661
You know, I'm just taking
a break from the real world.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.012
Yeah,
the real world sucks.

09:38.708 --> 09:39.535
Yeah.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.670
Jill was just diagnosed
with stage four cancer

09:43.713 --> 09:46.194
and I can't even afford
the flight to go see her.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.370
I'm so sorry. That's terrible.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.154
It is.

09:51.895 --> 09:54.550
But in here,
it's all good, right?

09:55.682 --> 09:57.509
Even if it's just
for a few hours.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.686
So, who's this rock starman?

09:59.729 --> 10:02.427
His real name
is Derek something

10:02.471 --> 10:04.473
and he's in here all the time.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.519
Word is his wife passed away.

10:07.563 --> 10:10.653
If you ask me, he stays in VR
way longer than is healthy.

10:13.917 --> 10:14.701
And that's my ride.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.095
See you around, Supergirl.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.897
That was metal!

10:36.940 --> 10:38.072
Thanks, Supergirl.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.682
Sure.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.162
It's amazing how real
all this feels.

10:43.425 --> 10:44.208
All this...

10:45.296 --> 10:46.515
Virtual reality.

10:52.564 --> 10:53.348
Virtual reality.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.918
What's she
talking about?

10:57.961 --> 10:59.615
One, two, three, four!

11:22.116 --> 11:23.770
Okay. Dragon at the fountain.

11:24.945 --> 11:25.772
What would Kara do?

11:27.251 --> 11:28.122
Heat vision.

11:28.905 --> 11:29.732
Okay.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.345
Kara makes this look so easy.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.825
All right.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.140
Okay.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.338
Supergirl, how does it feel
to defeat a Dracokardosian?

12:10.381 --> 12:12.253
Uh, I'm just glad
that I could help.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.645
So what are you
going to do now?

12:13.689 --> 12:15.038
Well, does anyone know

12:15.082 --> 12:16.083
where a girl can get a bite
to eat around here?

12:19.477 --> 12:21.088
That settles it.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.003
Uh, there's nothing
that connects Lex
to the failsafe hack

12:23.046 --> 12:24.700
or to the guy that did it.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.833
But if that guy was able to
hack that part of your system,

12:26.876 --> 12:28.704
who's to say
Lex won't target it, too?

12:31.228 --> 12:32.969
What is it?
Did Lex do something?

12:33.013 --> 12:34.492
No, not something he did,

12:34.536 --> 12:36.930
something we should
have done and didn't.

12:36.973 --> 12:40.803
The failsafe error I found,
it wasn't patched after all.

12:40.847 --> 12:41.804
You mean the back door's
still open?

12:41.848 --> 12:43.240
Yeah.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.807
But that means that

12:44.851 --> 12:46.026
there's a chance other people
could still be in there.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.070
I need to find Andrea.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.290
Kelly, what's going on?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.988
The failsafe glitch
Richard Bates exploited,

12:52.032 --> 12:53.468
it hasn't been fixed.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.904
-What?
-Yeah,

12:54.948 --> 12:56.427
I thought maybe it was
a slip-up with the records,

12:56.471 --> 12:57.559
but I checked.

12:57.602 --> 12:58.821
The order for the patch
was put in,

12:58.865 --> 13:01.084
but the work funds
haven't been released.

13:05.915 --> 13:06.786
Look...

13:08.222 --> 13:10.006
we have to do something
about this right now.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.486
Kelly, I understand
your concern,

13:11.529 --> 13:13.444
but what happened last week
was because of the hacker,

13:13.488 --> 13:15.707
not a flaw in our system.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.231
And since then,
there have been no reports

13:17.274 --> 13:18.667
of anyone being affected,
have there?

13:20.277 --> 13:21.713
No.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.020
This withholding
of funds is just

13:24.064 --> 13:25.717
corporate bureaucracy
with the board.

13:25.761 --> 13:26.980
I'll handle it.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.459
But there's nothing
to alarm our users about.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.898
You don't think our users
deserve a warning

13:31.941 --> 13:33.508
that the lenses
might be problematic?

13:33.551 --> 13:35.640
All that would do is make them
worry about the platform,

13:35.684 --> 13:37.729
and then they wouldn't be able
to use the platform

13:37.773 --> 13:39.427
to get over their worries.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.559
And when it comes to veterans
and sufferers of mental trauma,

13:41.603 --> 13:43.605
do we really wanna stop giving
them what they need?

13:45.781 --> 13:47.478
I would never let our consumers

13:47.522 --> 13:50.481
engage in anything that
would put them in jeopardy.

13:50.525 --> 13:53.006
Still, I'll call into Gemma
and get the funds released

13:53.049 --> 13:54.137
and that glitch fixed.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.706
Okay. Thanks.

13:57.924 --> 13:58.968
Thank you.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.671
-Well, if it isn't Supergirl.
-Hmm.

14:07.934 --> 14:08.978
Hi.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.288
These blueberry pancakes
are absolutely insane.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.899
I mean, they're just like
from when I was back home.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.119
It's, like,
crispy on the outside

14:19.162 --> 14:20.903
and a little bit gooey
on the inside.

14:22.862 --> 14:23.645
Oh, my God.

14:25.081 --> 14:28.955
Kelly could come here
and eat these without dying.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.522
Don't tell me, is Kelly
one of your Super Friends?

14:31.958 --> 14:33.307
Uh, no.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.612
No, no, no.
She's my girlfriend.

14:35.352 --> 14:38.138
My very smart, and kind,

14:38.181 --> 14:41.271
and wonderfully
supportive girlfriend

14:41.315 --> 14:43.360
who I was a complete
jerk to this morning.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.842
-We all have our bad days.
-Hmm.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.323
This is a little bit
more than that.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.590
I just found out
that my father passed away.

14:55.633 --> 14:59.115
He kind of treated me
like I was an equal.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.857
Especially when it came
to taking care of my mother.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.207
And definitely when it came
to taking care of my sister.

15:06.253 --> 15:10.170
And, uh, I don't know,
I thought it was really cool

15:10.213 --> 15:12.520
that he would give me
that kind of responsibility,

15:12.563 --> 15:16.828
but I look back at it now,
and I'm... I just...

15:16.872 --> 15:20.093
Like it is totally unfair
that he put all of that on me.

15:22.399 --> 15:26.099
I mean, my sister,
she can be a handful.

15:27.404 --> 15:29.972
So I thought
if I came in here, um,

15:30.016 --> 15:32.192
I could just feel some
freedom for myself.

15:32.235 --> 15:35.108
I could fly around
and I could knock things down

15:35.151 --> 15:37.675
without anybody being
able to stop me.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.982
And then I would...
I would feel better.

15:41.462 --> 15:42.463
But I don't.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.683
I mean, not really.

15:45.727 --> 15:49.209
'Cause, I mean,
my dad's still dead.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.996
My girlfriend, she's right.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.434
I have a lot of things
to work through.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.439
Anyway, that was... wow.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.441
Um...

16:04.485 --> 16:06.052
I, uh...

16:06.095 --> 16:08.489
I think it's about time that
I go back to the real world.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.447
What do you mean?

16:12.493 --> 16:16.062
Uh, just that
this has been a lot of fun,

16:16.105 --> 16:19.021
but I think it's time
to get back to reality.

16:19.065 --> 16:19.848
"Reality"?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.460
Are you okay, hon?

16:23.504 --> 16:26.202
How about another round
for my favorite customers?

16:26.246 --> 16:27.029
Works for me.

16:31.512 --> 16:34.602
Have you heard any more
about your sister?

16:34.645 --> 16:36.517
-My sister?
-Jill.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.001
Okay, how long
have you been in here, Bonnie?

16:43.089 --> 16:43.872
I'm Tilly.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.223
Treasure Hunter Tilly.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.311
Supergirl.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.357
J'onn?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.880
We need you
at the DEO right now.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.056
You're in the DEO?

16:54.100 --> 16:56.276
Supergirl, don't worry
about your friend.

16:56.319 --> 16:57.277
She's working through things.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.453
Like you.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.237
I'll see she gets
to where she needs to go.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.804
Keep 'em coming, Mac.

17:04.501 --> 17:05.894
Hey, um...

17:07.287 --> 17:08.243
Good luck with everything.

17:09.244 --> 17:10.029
You, too.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.755
Oh, it's just
like the real DEO.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.498
Maybe even better
than the real DEO.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.326
-Supergirl.
-Director J'onzz.

17:46.369 --> 17:48.676
We've just had word that
a short-range ballistic missile

17:48.719 --> 17:51.244
was stolen from
Thompson Marine Base
by unknown terrorists.

17:51.287 --> 17:54.116
Paired with the right tech,
an SRBM like that

17:54.160 --> 17:58.120
has the capacity
to wipe out everything
within a 20-mile radius.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.687
Can we track it?

17:59.730 --> 18:01.036
We're sweeping
the city for its signature now.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.737
This is the part where you say

18:06.781 --> 18:08.522
you'll circle the city
and track these guys down.

18:08.565 --> 18:09.566
Right, yes.

18:09.610 --> 18:12.134
Uh, sorry, I was just...

18:12.178 --> 18:14.789
You have no idea how good
it feels to be here with you.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.269
Supergirl,

18:16.312 --> 18:18.445
-this is Hank Henshaw.

18:18.488 --> 18:19.794
-There's only one thing alive
on less than four legs

18:19.837 --> 18:21.274
that can hear this frequency.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.362
And that's you.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.580
Are you okay?

18:23.624 --> 18:25.278
-It's Henshaw.
- What?

18:25.321 --> 18:27.802
He's speaking to me in some
sort of high-pitched frequency.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.760
My God. It is Henshaw.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.980
As I'm sure you've discovered
by now,

18:32.023 --> 18:34.374
I've stolen a missile
from a nearby base.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.332
What you haven't discovered

18:36.376 --> 18:39.248
is that while the DEO
is focused on my larceny,

18:39.292 --> 18:41.163
-I kidnapped your sister.
-Kara?

18:42.643 --> 18:45.341
Sprock! It is true. Look.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.343
How?

18:47.387 --> 18:49.389
The only way he could know
Kara is your sister

18:49.432 --> 18:52.043
is if he found out
your secret identity.

18:52.087 --> 18:53.219
There's
a nuclear warhead

18:53.262 --> 18:54.437
at the Tamaki Air Force Base

18:54.481 --> 18:56.091
south of the city.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.962
Get it and deliver it
to the abandoned warehouse

18:58.006 --> 19:00.182
on Waterfront Road
within the hour.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.750
Do it, or I'll reveal your
secret identity

19:02.793 --> 19:05.274
-and kill your sister.

19:05.318 --> 19:08.799
Alex, I know your history
with Henshaw.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.062
Promise me you won't let
feelings cloud your judgment

19:11.106 --> 19:12.238
as we bring him to justice.

19:13.282 --> 19:15.110
I can handle it.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.329
Where's Kara?

19:17.591 --> 19:18.374
She's safe.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.289
For now.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.334
What do you want?

19:23.074 --> 19:24.206
What do I want?

19:26.121 --> 19:27.644
Your father...

19:27.688 --> 19:30.995
infiltrated my organization,
ambushed me.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.606
Left me for dead
in the jungle.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.262
So this is what I want!

19:45.096 --> 19:46.924
You didn't think I'd come
unprepared, did you?

19:49.536 --> 19:51.451
You didn't think I'd bring
an active warhead, did you?

19:55.716 --> 19:56.934
I still have the missile.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.415
And I still have you.

19:59.459 --> 20:02.679
That's enough to get the DEO
back to its former glory.

20:02.723 --> 20:05.160
By blowing it up
and starting over.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.427
And now the DEO, your sister...

20:12.646 --> 20:15.083
and everyone you love will die.

20:19.479 --> 20:22.699
No one will be able
to save them... or you.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.440
I don't need anyone to save me.

20:26.442 --> 20:27.922
Because I am Supergirl!

20:47.071 --> 20:48.638
Supergirl.
-J'onn.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.945
I've got Henshaw,
but I don't know where...

20:50.988 --> 20:52.120
We have Kara.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.383
She's safe.

20:56.516 --> 21:00.084
You should not
have come back.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.956
And now you'll never
hurt my family again.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.182
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.622
So...

21:15.665 --> 21:18.494
Andrea said the failsafe patch
wasn't addressed

21:18.538 --> 21:21.497
because of bureaucracy
with the board.

21:24.587 --> 21:25.980
But...

21:26.023 --> 21:27.982
Ever since Luthor Corp
partnered with us...

21:29.070 --> 21:30.027
...the board
has a new member...

21:30.767 --> 21:31.594
Lex.

21:31.638 --> 21:33.770
So maybe he was behind it.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.903
He could have pressured
other board members

21:35.946 --> 21:37.078
to ignore the glitch

21:37.121 --> 21:38.688
so he could exploit it
for his own ends.

21:38.732 --> 21:41.996
Maybe trap people inside the VR
and lock in subscribers.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.259
Yeah, but we don't have
any facts to back that up.

21:47.393 --> 21:48.916
Well, there has to be
something we can do.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.745
This is a list
of almost 500 users

21:51.788 --> 21:54.965
who have been using our VR
non-stop for 48 hours or more.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.142
No one's called
about them, but...

21:58.186 --> 22:00.057
-They could still be trapped.
-Yeah.

22:01.842 --> 22:02.799
How do you feel about
helping me

22:02.843 --> 22:03.974
make a few hundred
phone calls?

22:06.760 --> 22:07.587
Hey.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.416
Good job today.

22:10.459 --> 22:13.027
-Henshaw's in containment.
-Good.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.638
-How's Kara?
- Back at CatCo,

22:15.682 --> 22:17.379
finishing her article
as we speak.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.773
Oh, and she, uh,
wanted me to remind you,

22:19.816 --> 22:22.384
it's your turn to pick up
the dumplings tonight.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.431
-That's my sister.

22:27.781 --> 22:28.782
I know that look.

22:29.478 --> 22:31.219
Is something on your mind?

22:33.308 --> 22:34.353
Yeah, I just, um...

22:36.311 --> 22:39.575
I don't know, everything just
feels so... so good.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.229
Hmm.

22:41.272 --> 22:44.580
But I keep having this feeling
that I've forgotten something.

22:44.624 --> 22:47.496
Kind of like the
"Did I lock the front door?"

22:47.540 --> 22:49.063
-kind of feeling.
-Hmm.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.805
But still, I...

22:51.848 --> 22:54.677
I know that I'm doing
what I'm supposed to be doing.

22:54.721 --> 22:57.506
I've got my team,
I've got my family...

22:58.507 --> 23:00.640
Everything, it feels...

23:02.468 --> 23:04.295
Right?

23:04.339 --> 23:07.647
Alex, you saved your family,

23:07.690 --> 23:10.998
the DEO, and the citizens
of National City today.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.608
That feeling you can't
quite pin down...

23:14.044 --> 23:14.828
it's called happiness.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.048
Now, come on,
let's go celebrate.

23:18.527 --> 23:19.398
Brainy's buying.

23:20.573 --> 23:21.443
-You're right.

23:21.487 --> 23:22.749
-Let's celebrate.
-Yeah.

23:31.888 --> 23:32.933
♪ Feelings

23:36.545 --> 23:40.419
♪ Nothing more than feelings

23:42.682 --> 23:47.121
♪ Trying to forget my...

23:47.861 --> 23:48.644
Thank you,

23:49.645 --> 23:50.951
President Lincoln.

23:54.694 --> 23:57.479
Hey, I'm sorry
about that abomination.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.655
If he'd read a history book,
he'd know

23:59.699 --> 24:02.832
that Honest Abe belongs
in the audience of the theater,

24:02.876 --> 24:05.313
not on the stage.

24:05.356 --> 24:09.273
Do we have a John Wilkes Booth
in the house?

24:09.317 --> 24:11.362
- Come on.
-Boo!

24:11.406 --> 24:14.322
What? You don't think
that's funny? Hmm?

24:19.414 --> 24:20.937
Now, back to our show.

24:21.721 --> 24:22.678
Who's next?

24:22.722 --> 24:25.420
Ah, I see a sister Kryptonian.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.378
To Supergirl!

24:27.422 --> 24:28.771
Oh, silence.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.686
Sorry, Vita,
I got carried away for a sec.

24:30.730 --> 24:31.948
Well, you're spared,

24:31.992 --> 24:34.298
but you're sent
to the back of the line.

24:34.342 --> 24:37.476
And no more Britney Spears
songs if you want to live.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.566
-I'll go get the drinks.
-Okay.

24:41.567 --> 24:42.742
You happy?

24:42.785 --> 24:44.439
Never happier.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.843
Yes, I understand.

24:57.713 --> 24:58.758
Very sorry to bother you.

24:59.715 --> 25:01.238
Yes.

25:02.588 --> 25:06.592
Wow, so that's 100
phone calls to 100 users,

25:06.635 --> 25:08.332
none who are trapped.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.770
Maybe I've taken us both
down a conspiracy rabbit hole.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.905
-There any word from Alex yet?
-Uh, I texted,

25:15.949 --> 25:17.603
and, um, no response.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.824
Maybe she still
needs space.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.394
You know,

25:26.437 --> 25:28.570
sometimes people
need a shoulder to cry on

25:28.614 --> 25:29.571
even if they won't admit it.

25:30.659 --> 25:31.486
You should go to her.

25:32.661 --> 25:33.749
I'll keep on this.

25:33.793 --> 25:35.272
Saw you looking at it,
I'll keep on it.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.232
In fact, I have a contact
at the NSA

25:38.275 --> 25:39.886
who might be able to help us
speed things up.

25:41.017 --> 25:42.628
You go be with
the woman you love.

25:42.671 --> 25:43.542
Thank you.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.774
Well, well, well, if it isn't
my favorite customer.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.297
Want a drink
on the house, Supergirl?

26:00.776 --> 26:01.560
Why not?

26:04.867 --> 26:07.391
Well, if it isn't
my favorite customer.

26:07.435 --> 26:08.871
Want a round
on the house, Supergirl?

26:08.915 --> 26:09.785
Heck, yeah.

26:12.266 --> 26:13.310
Hey.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.617
Supergirl.

26:15.661 --> 26:19.099
Hi. That's a...
That's a really great costume.

26:19.142 --> 26:20.622
Black.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.103
Now that is cool.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.628
Um... Sorry, what are you
talking about?

26:26.672 --> 26:29.805
Oh, I love this place.

26:29.849 --> 26:32.112
They just never make the drinks
cold enough, though.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.685
That... How did you...

26:39.728 --> 26:41.687
I've come here
to escape reality.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.427
Not have subpar drinks.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.516
This... This isn't real?

26:45.560 --> 26:47.475
What, you think all these
drinks would be on the house?

26:49.564 --> 26:50.521
Are you okay?

26:51.305 --> 26:53.524
This is impossible.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.178
You look like
you are bugging out.

26:56.919 --> 26:57.746
I'll just get someone.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.534
Supergirl. Are you all right?

27:03.578 --> 27:05.841
How can there be
two Supergirls?

27:05.885 --> 27:07.887
Perhaps it's the result
from Kryptonite poisoning.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.020
Should we head to the DEO?

27:11.064 --> 27:12.805
Perhaps we should go
back to the medbay.

27:12.848 --> 27:15.111
No, this isn't real.

27:16.722 --> 27:17.810
I have to get out of here.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.681
I have to go.

27:26.732 --> 27:27.646
That was weird.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.584
Alex. Are you okay?

27:54.237 --> 27:55.717
-Alex?
-J'onn?

27:55.761 --> 27:57.980
Psi just launched
a psychic attack
on National City.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.287
She's making everybody
doubt their reality.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.115
Don't tell me
she got to you, too.

28:02.158 --> 28:03.986
-We need you here.
-No, I'm all right.

28:07.773 --> 28:08.687
And I'm on my way.

28:17.391 --> 28:18.392
Hello?

28:20.786 --> 28:21.700
Alex?

28:25.616 --> 28:26.748
What's wrong with your lenses?

28:27.793 --> 28:29.490
You wanna come out? Hey.

28:40.066 --> 28:40.849
Okay, babe.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.157
It's time to wake up.

28:56.691 --> 28:57.779
Don't worry.

28:57.823 --> 29:00.173
I'm coming in
to get you.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.790
Well, I guess some villains
are all thought and no action.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.838
-Alex.
-Kelly.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.970
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

29:15.014 --> 29:16.406
I just... I didn't know
if you had tried to get out,

29:16.450 --> 29:18.017
but your failsafe
isn't working.

29:18.495 --> 29:19.627
What?

29:19.670 --> 29:20.846
The glitch that
Richard Bates hacked,

29:21.672 --> 29:22.891
it wasn't fixed.

29:22.935 --> 29:26.025
Um, and I think you might
have been affected.

29:26.068 --> 29:28.462
I can't eject you, so I need
you to wake yourself up

29:28.505 --> 29:29.593
and end your simulation,

29:29.637 --> 29:31.291
and then I'll tell
you everything.

29:31.334 --> 29:33.162
End... end my simulation? I...

29:33.206 --> 29:35.861
You need to exit
your virtual reality.

29:35.904 --> 29:38.689
I can't do it for you.
You have to do it for yourself.

29:41.431 --> 29:42.432
Oh, my God.

29:44.086 --> 29:45.566
Psi must have
gotten to her, too.

29:46.654 --> 29:47.873
What? No.

29:47.916 --> 29:49.222
I'll make sure
she gets to the medbay.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.876
I don't need to go
to the medbay.

29:50.919 --> 29:53.487
You have to end this.
This isn't real. You know that.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.837
A-ha! She was
assaulted by Psi.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.012
That never happened.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.231
Hey, Alex,

29:58.274 --> 29:59.841
can't you see
that this virtual reality

29:59.885 --> 30:01.190
is just giving you
what you want?

30:01.234 --> 30:02.670
Supergirl.

30:02.713 --> 30:04.324
There's a theft in progress
at National City Bank.

30:04.367 --> 30:06.456
NCPD is on their way,
but they won't make it in time.

30:07.457 --> 30:08.981
Kelly, I have to handle this.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.852
You go with J'onn and Brainy
to the medbay.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.071
They'll take care of you,
I promise.

30:13.115 --> 30:13.899
Let's go.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.339
End simulation.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.776
Okay, slow down, Kelly.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.083
Are you sure that this is
a failsafe malfunction?

30:24.126 --> 30:26.346
I don't know.
That is why I called you.

30:26.389 --> 30:29.044
Alex's lenses
are practically red.

30:29.088 --> 30:32.352
And she's not responding to
any of my methods of ejection.

30:32.395 --> 30:33.570
I tried adrenaline,

30:33.614 --> 30:35.442
but it was like
she didn't even feel it.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.357
What about going into the VR
for direct contact?

30:37.400 --> 30:38.706
Yeah,
I tried that, too,

30:38.749 --> 30:40.926
and there was no sign
of a failsafe button.

30:42.144 --> 30:44.538
She wouldn't even listen to me.

30:44.581 --> 30:47.802
Before she went in,
she was grieving.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.760
I don't know, maybe because
of her emotional state,

30:49.804 --> 30:51.675
she was more
susceptible to our AI

30:51.719 --> 30:54.069
and had a mild psychotic break.

30:54.113 --> 30:55.897
I've seen this
with some of my patients,

30:55.941 --> 30:57.029
but still...

30:57.072 --> 30:58.813
I'm still able
to bring them out.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.902
Okay, Kelly, look.
We need to think this through.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.340
It was like
she was lost in there.

31:06.168 --> 31:09.476
Then we need a way
to shock her out.

31:09.519 --> 31:12.131
We need to show Alex that
she is not in the real world

31:12.174 --> 31:14.960
by confronting her with
something that's unexplainable,

31:15.003 --> 31:17.397
but also absolutely undeniable.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.099
Something like Alex herself.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.023
I hope this works.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.336
Thanks, Supergirl.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.120
These guys sure chose
the wrong bank to rob.

31:46.817 --> 31:47.949
Speaking of bad choices,

31:47.993 --> 31:49.124
there's still time enough
for you

31:49.168 --> 31:50.430
to turn your life around,
young lady.

31:52.562 --> 31:53.389
Hi, Alex.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.958
How do you know my real name?

31:57.002 --> 31:57.916
Because I'm you.

31:59.004 --> 31:59.830
You can feel it.

32:01.441 --> 32:03.008
How?

32:03.051 --> 32:04.618
I've been sent to show you
something that you need to see.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.147
Please.

32:12.191 --> 32:13.627
Please listen to her.

32:13.670 --> 32:16.195
-What do I need to see?
-That none of this is real.

32:16.238 --> 32:18.153
Yes, it is. Of course it is.

32:18.197 --> 32:20.677
Supergirl, is everything okay?

32:20.721 --> 32:24.029
Come with me, and I'll show you
the truth you've been avoiding.

32:24.072 --> 32:27.162
Come on, Supergirl,
the NCPD can take it from here.

32:27.206 --> 32:28.250
Supergirl, let us help you.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.991
Or are you afraid
of facing reality?

32:37.433 --> 32:38.826
I remember this place.

32:39.609 --> 32:41.220
That...

32:41.263 --> 32:44.397
That bomb,
I planted that bomb.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.616
This is the Cadmus facility
where I last saw Dad.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.580
-Is that--
-Jeremiah.

32:53.623 --> 32:56.409
We didn't face him before,
but we need to now.

32:56.452 --> 32:59.586
Maybe now he can explain
why he never came back.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.022
- Hey!

33:01.066 --> 33:02.415
Supergirl, get away from her!

33:02.458 --> 33:03.677
She's a shape-shifter.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.463
-No.
-Come on. I know another way.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.290
Okay.

33:13.513 --> 33:14.470
There he is.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.084
Dad?

33:27.092 --> 33:28.267
This is what
you needed to see.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.052
The truth in the real world.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.098
The real world?

33:33.141 --> 33:35.839
The real world
where we're not Supergirl.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.363
And where even if we were,

33:37.406 --> 33:40.235
nothing that we could have done
would have saved him.

33:40.279 --> 33:42.063
We always hoped
that he'd come back to us.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.196
And if he didn't,

33:44.239 --> 33:45.980
we hoped that
someday we'd find him.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.243
That's why you took on
the role of Supergirl.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.115
She stands for hope.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.508
But now that Dad's dead,

33:52.552 --> 33:54.293
we know that there's no chance
of that ever happening.

33:54.336 --> 33:57.470
And even if we were Supergirl
and we did find him,

33:57.513 --> 34:00.168
it wouldn't change anything.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.997
His life was a result
of his choices.

34:03.737 --> 34:04.520
Not ours.

34:06.957 --> 34:07.741
But it's gonna be okay.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.092
Because in the real world,

34:11.136 --> 34:13.877
we still have people
who love us

34:13.920 --> 34:16.880
and who wanna help us
make the changes we can.

34:16.924 --> 34:20.797
Unlike here, where everyone
is trying to lock us in.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.802
Don't listen to her, Supergirl.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.594
You're leaving us no choice.

34:37.553 --> 34:38.989
Hey.

34:41.340 --> 34:42.167
Alex.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.342
Get away from her, please.

34:44.386 --> 34:45.605
She's dangerous.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.130
Don't let her put
crazy thoughts in your head.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.567
-She's not--
-This is your home.

34:51.610 --> 34:52.655
We are your family.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.788
You belong with us,
not with her.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.008
That thing needs
to be destroyed.

34:59.532 --> 35:02.622
If you can't... we will.

35:22.424 --> 35:23.425
Not in my reality.

35:29.779 --> 35:30.563
Hey.

35:36.438 --> 35:37.265
End simulation.

35:48.450 --> 35:49.234
Wait, no, no, no.
Hang on. Hang on.

35:51.236 --> 35:54.195
How do I know
if I'm not in the VR still?

35:54.239 --> 35:55.979
Because we had
a fight this morning

35:56.023 --> 35:57.024
that was never resolved.

35:58.895 --> 36:00.549
Because your dad
is gone for good,

36:00.593 --> 36:01.420
and you're sad.

36:02.377 --> 36:03.422
But it's gonna be okay.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.078
I know.

36:09.906 --> 36:11.343
Yeah, I know that now.

36:21.309 --> 36:22.223
I love you.

36:25.052 --> 36:27.010
Thank you
for not giving up on me.

36:27.054 --> 36:27.924
I would never.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.406
I'm so sorry.

36:33.103 --> 36:35.193
I was such a jerk.

36:37.847 --> 36:39.240
And I pushed...

36:40.415 --> 36:43.723
J'onn and Kara and you away.

36:46.726 --> 36:50.382
You know, I've been so angry
at my dad for so long,

36:50.425 --> 36:53.167
for abandoning
Kara and I,

36:53.211 --> 36:56.039
for never reaching out,
you know?

36:56.083 --> 36:58.172
But as hurt as I've been,

36:58.216 --> 37:00.348
I just... I kept thinking

37:00.392 --> 37:02.655
that he would come back
into our lives someday.

37:02.698 --> 37:04.265
And then, you know,

37:04.309 --> 37:06.920
I get the news
about his death, and I just...

37:08.487 --> 37:11.359
I just got so mad at everyone.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.190
But the reality...

37:18.453 --> 37:20.281
is that I was just
mad at myself.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.025
'Cause I couldn't save him.

37:27.114 --> 37:28.463
And so I...

37:28.507 --> 37:30.726
I felt...

37:30.770 --> 37:32.293
I felt hopeless.

37:32.337 --> 37:33.903
You are not hopeless.

37:34.774 --> 37:35.949
You are a warrior.

37:42.912 --> 37:44.000
What's wrong?

37:44.044 --> 37:45.959
I think there's a lot
more going on

37:46.002 --> 37:48.353
in the VR than we know about.

37:48.396 --> 37:51.530
Because I don't think
I was the only one
that was lost in there.

37:51.573 --> 37:55.360
There... There was a woman
named, uh, Bonnie,

37:55.403 --> 37:57.318
and there was a guy, Derek.

37:58.798 --> 38:01.453
And... and I think
they were stuck in there, too.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.803
And if there was
three of us...

38:05.152 --> 38:06.327
then there could be
a lot more.

38:07.807 --> 38:08.764
Um...

38:10.026 --> 38:11.506
Okay, I... I... I'm on it.

38:13.247 --> 38:16.381
Um, but first, we need
to get you to Midvale.

38:16.816 --> 38:17.773
Okay?

38:21.603 --> 38:22.387
Yeah.

38:24.214 --> 38:24.998
Yeah, we do.

38:27.261 --> 38:29.350
Lex Luthor
arrived in Madrid today

38:29.394 --> 38:30.873
to a sellout crowd

38:30.917 --> 38:32.440
to discuss Obsidian North's
new Platinum...

38:32.484 --> 38:33.398
Cocky bastard.

38:33.441 --> 38:34.877
Pre-orders are so high,

38:34.921 --> 38:36.705
the phone lines have
currently shut down.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.359
-People are hailing
Lex Luthor

38:38.403 --> 38:40.230
as the innovator
of the millennium.

38:40.274 --> 38:41.754
Nice work, Arnie.

38:41.797 --> 38:42.798
Promininant tech giants

38:42.842 --> 38:44.539
are leaping onto the VR scene,

38:44.583 --> 38:47.542
each driving forward new
and upcoming product lines.

38:47.586 --> 38:51.067
However, nothing will
come close to Platinum VR.

38:51.111 --> 38:54.375
If you think you kind of
understand what's going on
in tech today...

39:01.295 --> 39:04.080
Thank you, Kelly.
I'm glad that Alex was okay.

39:05.299 --> 39:06.300
Yes. Bye.

39:20.096 --> 39:22.360
You've reached
Gemma Cooper's office.

39:22.403 --> 39:24.710
Miss Cooper is not available
right now. But if you
leave your name--

39:31.847 --> 39:33.675
I need a full
diagnostic write-up

39:33.719 --> 39:34.894
on the failsafe error code.

39:34.937 --> 39:37.287
And I want a patch
worked up immediately.

39:37.331 --> 39:39.812
Nothing else moves forward
until this is done.

39:39.855 --> 39:42.031
-Do you understand?
- Yes, Miss Rojas.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.500
Lex Luthor.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.197
What are you up to?

41:06.202 --> 41:10.555
Jeremiah was a loving
and caring man.

41:10.598 --> 41:13.514
It's what made him
a great partner,
a great friend

41:13.558 --> 41:16.865
and... a great father.

41:16.909 --> 41:19.477
He was brave
and compassionate.

41:21.348 --> 41:24.177
He knew just what to say
to make your life brighter,

41:24.220 --> 41:27.876
how to pick you up
when you were feeling down.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.183
In spite of all
the twists and turns

41:30.226 --> 41:31.489
that Jeremiah's life took,

41:33.229 --> 41:37.016
the kindness,
compassion and love...

41:38.800 --> 41:40.367
that was real.

41:40.410 --> 41:42.151
I'm sorry for all the things
that I said.

41:42.195 --> 41:42.978
It doesn't matter.

41:45.024 --> 41:45.807
You're here now.
