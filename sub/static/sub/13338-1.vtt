WEBVTT

00:08.400 --> 00:10.760
Last time us Geordies hit Greece...

00:10.840 --> 00:12.600
It was complete carnage.

00:15.640 --> 00:19.240
Gary and Charlotte actually proved
that they can be "friends".

00:19.320 --> 00:21.720
We're in a good place.
Chloe was so into Scott.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.480
I do actually like you.
Scott didn't give a shit.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.280
I like you as a mate.
I don't like you in that way.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.680
I had some massive news
for the whole family.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.560
I'm gay.
Love you.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.960
And the whole family
was right behind him.

00:34.040 --> 00:38.400
It means even more fanny
for the fucking turbo dick.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.960
Kyle broke Holly's heart
and divided the house.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.720
I can't put you through this
any more.I loved you.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.640
Who the fuck you talking to, man?

00:48.720 --> 00:51.640
The lads had one of the biggest
bust-ups we've ever had.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.400
Gary! (screams) Gary!
I'm fucking sick of it.

00:54.480 --> 00:55.880
Kyle had to go.

00:55.960 --> 00:58.120
(sobs)

00:58.200 --> 01:00.880
Marnie got engaged.
Will you marry me?Yes.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.720
(all scream)
..and left the family. Bye.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.240
Nine became seven.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.040
But the family lived on.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.800
And now we're stronger than ever.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.320
Watch out, Newcastle. We are back.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.960
We're gonna go fucking acka.

01:19.320 --> 01:22.200
It's time to smash Newcastle.
We're on the pull!

01:22.280 --> 01:24.480
Things are gonna go pure radge.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.080
What the fuck?

01:27.160 --> 01:28.600
(screams)
(shouting)

01:28.680 --> 01:30.120
Calm the fuck down!

01:30.200 --> 01:33.040
This time, there's gonna be
more necking on.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.760
More kick-offs.
(screams)

01:37.840 --> 01:40.400
More drama.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.960
Slag! More tears, more tantrums,

01:43.040 --> 01:46.040
more loving, more shagging,
more drunk-ness.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.800
Howay, Chloe, man.
And more falling over!

01:48.880 --> 01:51.200
Sounds fucking mint!

01:52.200 --> 01:54.720
Watch out, Newcastle,
cos the Geordie squad

01:54.800 --> 01:56.560
are back in the fucking mix.

01:57.720 --> 02:01.040
Let's get this fucking party
started. Let the games begin.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.080
You are a fucking liar!

02:03.160 --> 02:07.120
Newcastle! Oi, oi!
It's time to tear up the toon.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.200
(all scream)

02:13.120 --> 02:15.200
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.600
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.080
Get me in this house cos I'm gonna
tear it up.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.640
I'm preened to perfection.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.520
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.920
I'm cheeky, colourful,
full of mischief.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.400
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.200
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:34.800 --> 02:37.280
The Geordies
are back on their home turf

02:37.360 --> 02:39.880
so we are gonna buck the arse
clean off the toon.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.160
I'm back, bitches!

02:47.240 --> 02:50.360
I've got brand-new sparkling
gnashers, a sassy attitude.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.640
Newcastle, watch out!

02:52.720 --> 02:55.080
Hi, baby!
(squeals)

02:55.160 --> 02:58.680
I'm so excited to get back to
the house with my best friend Chloe.

02:58.760 --> 03:02.560
But what the fuck's her mam doing
here? And why is she riding shotgun?

03:02.640 --> 03:05.080
Is this your car? Can you drive?
Yeah!

03:05.160 --> 03:07.520
I'm petrified getting in the car
with Chloe.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.040
I hope I get there in one piece.
Nathan.Mm-hm.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.520
You know I've just turned 20?
And I'm a woman.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.480
I've decided I wanna be a bad bitch.
When I see Scott,

03:15.560 --> 03:18.480
I'm gonna ignore him
and pretend he's not even there.

03:18.560 --> 03:22.000
Treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen.
That's what a bad bitch would do.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.800
Us bad bitches ride together.
I would high-five you

03:24.880 --> 03:27.520
but I don't want you
to take your eyes off the road.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.960
(horn honks)We're back home,
where we belong. Howay, Gaz.

03:33.040 --> 03:36.120
Get your arse in the car,
it's fucking party time.

03:37.400 --> 03:41.080
I'll do everything exactly the same
as I did in Greece. It was perfect.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.320
Had a laugh, did everything
I wanted, apart from pull a bird.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.840
That's right.
Gaz is still in a relationship

03:46.920 --> 03:48.320
and I'm still loving it.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.880
This time round, I'm picking Gaz up.
I'm sure everyone thinks

03:52.960 --> 03:56.520
that I used to get the bus. Who
the fuck would get on one of them?

03:56.600 --> 03:59.520
Since last time,
I've been a bit of a tit.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.640
I've got too many points
on my licence,

04:01.720 --> 04:04.640
which means I've been banned
from driving for a while.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.200
So the only option to get to
the Geordie Shore house is the bus.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.680
Last time around,
I had a total nightmare.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.240
But this time, I'm really excited
to just have fun with Charlotte.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.360
(phone rings)

04:22.440 --> 04:24.520
Hi, Char!

04:24.600 --> 04:26.920
I'm on my way to the house,
where are you?

04:30.040 --> 04:31.760
What?
What can be more important

04:31.840 --> 04:33.760
than seeing your best friend?

04:33.840 --> 04:37.000
I'm going back into the house
where there's so many memories

04:37.080 --> 04:39.040
and with Kyle not being there
as well,

04:39.120 --> 04:42.120
it's gonna be really,
really difficult for us.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.160
Meeting up with the family this time
isn't gonna be easy.

04:45.240 --> 04:48.680
I'm coming back into the house
with a massive secret.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.800
Cheers, mate. Nice one.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.600
Fuck me, I've never ran so much
in my entire life.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.960
I feel like Usain Bolt after
he's just necked a pack of Haribo.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.680
But I've gotta swallow my pride

05:06.760 --> 05:11.120
because I would never miss this
for the fucking world. Oi, oi!

05:11.200 --> 05:14.720
Hold on a minute. I've nashed
out of mine, nashed to the bus stop,

05:14.800 --> 05:16.520
got the bus, nashed to the house

05:16.600 --> 05:18.920
and I still manage
to be the first one here?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.520
Talk about
Scotty On Time Fucking T.

05:21.600 --> 05:26.120
"Welcome home. Night off
so enjoy yourselves, Anna." Slag.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.120
Fucking sound.
There's shots all over the table.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.520
I am not messing about here, like.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.800
Heeeey!

05:33.880 --> 05:35.400
Necksies.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.760
I'm gonna bang out some Jaeger bombs

05:37.840 --> 05:40.560
and go and check out
my favourite room in the house.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.640
(laughs) What the fuck?

05:43.720 --> 05:44.960
So I walk in the shag pad

05:45.040 --> 05:48.920
and what is going on with the bed?!
It's round and fucking tiny.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.360
Howay, Anna.
I'm not a fucking Labrador.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.360
Mmm, yeah.

05:58.520 --> 06:02.760
Hello? I've walked in the house
and it looks absolutely wicked.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.240
I'm so excited to be here.
But where the fuck is everyone else?

06:07.400 --> 06:12.040
Eh? Three? This is weird. It looks
like some kind of Jaeger monster

06:12.120 --> 06:13.640
has snuck in here before me.

06:13.720 --> 06:17.080
I'm gonna fix myself a strong drink
and hunt the fucker down.

06:19.640 --> 06:24.960
(laughs) I'm lying in this bed in
the shag pad, testing the durability

06:25.040 --> 06:28.040
then fucking Holly walks in.
Howay, babe.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.680
Get them big fucking tits
in my basket. Hollies!

06:30.760 --> 06:33.360
No, no! Please, no!
Listen, you know it's fate.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.600
No, don't. (laughs)
I don't want none of this flirting,

06:36.680 --> 06:40.240
I just wanna have a laugh. Why don't
you wait till Chloe gets here?

06:40.320 --> 06:43.360
If you look at the reflection,
cos that's weird writing,

06:43.440 --> 06:45.160
it looks like "sex, sex, sex".

06:45.240 --> 06:48.280
You would think that, Scott,
wouldn't ya? Of course, man.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.880
Brain's in my dick. Right. First
things first, let's get mortal.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.960
Cheers, kid.
Cheers!

06:55.040 --> 06:57.040
Titting hell.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.040
Me and Gaz rock up to the house
absolutely buzzing.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.320
I just hope everyone's there
so we can get fucking smashed.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.520
(all scream)

07:09.600 --> 07:13.040
Scott and Holly are in there waiting
for us and so is a Jaeger bomb.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.760
The Geordies are back. You could've
picked us up, you fucking dicks!

07:16.840 --> 07:20.000
I had to get the bus!
Scott, you should've told us.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.720
I would've drove past the bus stop
and gave you the fucking finger.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.160
Since Greece,
I've missed having Nathan's life

07:29.240 --> 07:32.560
and now that he's back, I'm gonna
mix him up the Turbo T Special,

07:32.640 --> 07:35.640
a drink which is gonna fucking blow
his dick clean off.

07:35.720 --> 07:39.040
Scott. No, no, no, no! Oh!
He'll never drink that.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.640
He'll never drink that. No, it's too
big. You need to pour a bit out.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.640
Nathan loves it big.
(all chuckle)

07:48.600 --> 07:51.200
I thought you could drive!
Someone could help!

07:51.280 --> 07:54.480
I should never have let Chloe
pick us up, the fucking radgie.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.040
We ended up in Sunderland.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.720
I need a fucking drink.
(all scream)

08:00.800 --> 08:03.560
Chloe actually looks a lot better
this time.

08:03.640 --> 08:07.000
But I'm never gonna tell her
cos she'll fall back in love with us

08:07.080 --> 08:11.920
and constantly blag my head.
Oh, my God, everyone looks so nice!

08:12.000 --> 08:15.680
There's Scott. Come on,
you bad bitch. Ignore the bastard.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.120
Aw.
Hi, Aaron!

08:17.200 --> 08:21.240
No way. That's not like Chloe, that.
Normally, she's fucking all over us.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.800
(laughter)Hello!
Hello, beautiful!

08:23.880 --> 08:25.600
Chloe's got a brand-new look.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.080
She kind of looks like
a classy Kat Slater.

08:28.160 --> 08:31.520
First things first. First things
first. Jaeger bombs.Shit.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.720
Jaeger bombs!
Here, Chloe.

08:33.800 --> 08:37.000
I can't wait to see Nathan's face
when he necks this drink.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.760
That kid is gonna fucking spew
all over.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.760
(all) Cheers!
Whoo!Good to be back.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.160
(all groan)
Oh, that was disgusting.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.600
(all laugh)

08:49.680 --> 08:51.640
You stitched us up there,
didn't you?

08:51.720 --> 08:53.840
I've been in the house 20 seconds

08:53.920 --> 08:57.160
and the lads are already pulling
pranks. This is gonna be fun.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.360
I'm not having this again.
No! I'm not doing it!Oh!

09:00.440 --> 09:03.000
Last time round
we lost Marnie and we lost Kyle,

09:03.080 --> 09:05.000
but we're stronger than ever.

09:05.080 --> 09:08.120
It actually is weird.
Kyle obviously is not here

09:08.200 --> 09:10.560
but Marnie's not here as well.
It is weird.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.880
Like, there's so many memories
in here, isn't there?

09:13.960 --> 09:16.360
How long before you
get back on Team Cock?

09:16.440 --> 09:17.960
Judging by Holly's face,

09:18.040 --> 09:21.440
there's fucking no chance
she's going near any fucking cock.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.120
I'm still gay.
I wasn't hitting on you. Calm down.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.200
Holly got asked a question.
Let her answer it. Shit.

09:27.280 --> 09:30.800
There is a reason why I can't get
back on the cock any more

09:30.880 --> 09:33.200
but I'm not quite ready
to tell anyone yet.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.560
Last time,
it was difficult for everyone.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.880
It affected the whole house.
This time, I wanna have fun.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.440
Get the old Holly back.
No, it's new Holly.

09:41.520 --> 09:45.160
Well, if I'm being totally honest,
it's not exactly the new Holly

09:45.240 --> 09:47.200
because I'm back with Kyle.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.520
And if I told everyone else,
they'd go fucking crazy.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.040
The fuck you got on your head?
Fucker. You'll have no room left.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.600
I was running out of space
so I got my skull done.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.040
Fair play, you've got your skull
tattooed.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.000
But why did you let a seven-year-old
do it? Where's Charlotte?

10:03.080 --> 10:06.400
I rang her on the way and I said,
"Where are you? So excited."

10:06.480 --> 10:08.760
She's got stuff to do before.
Give me a C.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.760
She'll be here soon.
Charlotte's not coming tonight.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.400
It's a small squad. But let's
get this party started.Cheers!

10:15.480 --> 10:17.160
Cheers! Whoo!

10:17.240 --> 10:20.640
Scott. Everyone, go and get ready.
Time for me to wash my cock

10:20.720 --> 10:23.960
because we're going to hit it harder
than ever before.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.880
I did kind of expect, obviously,
to have Charlotte here

10:31.960 --> 10:34.240
to support us through
Kyle not being here.

10:34.320 --> 10:37.560
I'm not very good at giving advice.
But I'll try my hardest.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.800
I'm glad you're here for us.
Me and Holly are getting ready.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.800
It's gonna feel so weird
without Charlotte and Marnie.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.920
It feels like a morgue.
How did you feel when you saw Scott?

10:47.000 --> 10:50.360
Will you go there again? I've got
a new tactic to make him want us.

10:50.440 --> 10:56.080
What is it? I'm gonna ignore him. Be
a bad bitch. Boys love bad bitches.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.640
He'll be eating out of
the palm of my hands.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.040
Will you be able to
when you're drunk? Yeah.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.240
I'm gonna take it steady
cos I wanna be the player this time.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.760
I don't have the slightest bit
of faith that Chloe isn't gonna get

11:07.840 --> 11:10.440
a few drinks down her neck
and be all over Scott.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.640
Last time round, Greece. Aaron,
you banged first. You did well.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.040
So, this time round,
it's game on again.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.680
Tonight is family night, which means
me and Scott can't pull birds.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.640
But don't worry, I'll show you
how it's done tomorrow.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.680
Chloe's in the family.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.080
Lads, don't be starting this shite
again.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.360
Do I like the attention off Chloe?
Aye.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.440
Do I like Chloe and wanna get
with her? Fucking no.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.240
I know for a fine fact,
if she pulled another lad,

11:39.320 --> 11:42.360
you'd be pissed off.I hope she
does. I don't give a fuck.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.600
Scott may or may not fancy Chloe,
but one thing's for sure.

11:45.680 --> 11:49.600
As soon as she gives another lad
any attention, he fucking hates it.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.440
Nathan, you on the pull?
I've got a boyfriend, so no.

11:52.520 --> 11:54.160
What?
What? Is it serious?

11:54.240 --> 11:55.880
Yeah, it is.
What's he called?

11:55.960 --> 11:58.560
Called Craig.
I've got a boyfriend and I'm in love

11:58.640 --> 12:00.760
and I'm not gonna let the house
break me.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.920
I'm going to stay faithful
till the end.Lads, come on!

12:04.000 --> 12:06.480
(screaming)

12:06.560 --> 12:08.040
It's the first night back

12:08.120 --> 12:11.240
and we're gonna do
what we do best, get fucking mortal.

12:11.320 --> 12:14.080
(all shout)
Let's get fucking smashed! Whoo!

12:20.200 --> 12:23.840
It's our first night out. Bijoux.
This place never lets us down.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.160
Let's fucking party.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.720
We get to the club
and everyone starts drinking.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.800
I feel like the
family's back together. Buzzing!

12:41.720 --> 12:44.320
It's our first night back
and it does feel weird

12:44.400 --> 12:47.280
with me not being on the pull
cos I'm in a relationship.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.280
But I can concentrate on
being a good friend to Holly.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.360
Talking about Kyle
is making me feel awkward

13:01.440 --> 13:04.120
and Nathan's being really sweet
and supportive.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.120
Now I feel like the bitch of Bijoux.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.920
I understand why Holly's not
embracing single life

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
but hopefully that'll change
when Charlotte gets here.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.160
I'm sticking to my game plan
and ignoring Scott.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.200
Who's Scott?
I don't know any Scotts.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.880
Since I'm not on the pull,
I've still gotta have fun.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.720
The best way to do that
on a night out is wind Scott up.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.360
Nice one, Gaz. Let's put that
big, daft radgie to the test.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.720
Surprise, surprise.
Aaron's up for a flirt.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.960
It's a good opportunity
to be a bad bitch.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.640
It'll give Scott
something to think about.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.280
Aaron and Chloe
are dancing and flirting

14:06.360 --> 14:09.760
and in three, two, one... job done.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.080
Chloe, I know I told you
I didn't want nowt to do with you,

14:18.160 --> 14:21.400
but can we not even have
a fucking frisk any more, like?

14:21.480 --> 14:25.400
The bad bitch is on top. Scott is
following us around like a Labrador.

14:25.480 --> 14:29.280
It's time to celebrate and get...
(high-pitched)# ...mortaaaal #

14:33.840 --> 14:37.480
# I'm a bad bitch, bitch, bitch
I'm a bad bitch, bitch, bitch #

14:40.240 --> 14:43.640
As usual on the first night,
everyone is pure buckled

14:43.720 --> 14:47.320
so it's time to bail this club
and get our arses back to the house.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.120
Despite the odd awkward moment,
tonight has been amazing.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.520
But I'm fucking off to bed
before anyone else mentions Kyle.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.560
(all laugh)

15:04.640 --> 15:08.080
We get home and I want to make sure
Nathan gets one of his five a day.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.320
Aaron.
Chilli!

15:09.400 --> 15:10.680
Chilli. (laughs)

15:11.640 --> 15:13.600
(sighing)

15:13.680 --> 15:15.160
We get back to the house

15:15.240 --> 15:19.560
and Chloe straightaway turns back to
her usual self, flirting with Scott.

15:19.640 --> 15:24.040
Where the fuck has the bad bitch
gone? Me and the boys are off to bed.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.120
Scott.
What?

15:26.200 --> 15:28.560
You do know how much I care
about you.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.440
No. You just swept us of my feet.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.760
(giggles) I've done so well tonight
but once I've had a drink,

15:34.840 --> 15:37.920
I can't help but flirt with Scott.
Shit.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.600
I can give you a cuddle
cos I feel like this is, like,

15:41.680 --> 15:44.200
the only time
we've actually been friends.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.480
Like, proper friends,
you know what I mean? Mmm.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.920
I'm telling Scott I like being
just friends but who am I kidding?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.760
I fancy him so much!
I want him to be my boyfriend.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.440
Scott.
What?

15:55.520 --> 15:58.120
Did you notice what
I was doing tonight? No, what?

15:58.200 --> 16:01.520
Was trying to ignore you a bit.
The little rascal's just told me

16:01.600 --> 16:04.600
she was ignoring us on purpose.
She was playing a game

16:04.680 --> 16:07.960
to try and get in my kegs. I'm not
up for it. I've told you that.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.040
No.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.840
I can't handle this any more.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.200
Chloe's good for a frisk but when
she starts to get pure mushy,

16:17.280 --> 16:20.960
it's time for me to open the bakery
cos she's getting fucking pied.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.440
For fuck's sake. Whenever I think
I'm getting close to Scott,

16:24.520 --> 16:28.240
I get pied. I'm absolutely gutted.
I'm going to bed.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.840
I enjoyed it. Last night was wicked,
but Holly was very quiet.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.360
That's not what I'd expect
from a single girl

16:53.440 --> 16:55.600
back in Newcastle,
wanting to have fun.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.280
Do you reckon it's because
Charlotte's not here?

16:58.360 --> 17:00.200
Cos normally she's got Charlotte.

17:07.880 --> 17:11.120
Last night was mint.
We got pissed with the family.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.640
Holly's probably missing Charlotte
a lot. It'll always be hard.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.400
Your best friend and ex-boyfriend
not being here.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.440
It's just so weird.
Everywhere I go, it's just memories.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.840
I had a good night, though.
Keeping my secret

17:22.920 --> 17:25.360
is a lot harder than I thought
it was going to be.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.880
And talking about Kyle
makes me feel awkward.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.400
Can you rate us
on my performance please?

17:30.480 --> 17:33.600
You were a bad bitch
for around about five minutes.

17:33.680 --> 17:38.560
That it? And then you started doing
some weird dancing.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.640
So I wasn't a bad bitch. It was more
crazy bitch than bad bitch.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.400
I really hate to say it, Chloe,

17:44.480 --> 17:47.240
but the truth is,
once a radgie, always a radgie.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.600
Then what happened?
Did you speak to Scott?

17:49.680 --> 17:54.120
I did kind of lower myself and
did tell Scott it was all for him.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.960
But that's only cos I was drunk.
You've fucked it now.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.760
Let's face it.
The bad bitch is dead.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.680
I need a plan B because I'm not
giving up on Scott that easily.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.280
We're all chilling out and
oh, my God, the front door opens.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.120
Please let it be Charlotte!

18:17.200 --> 18:19.800
Hi yous.
(all) Hi.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.240
Fucking hell, it's Anna.
That means we've got to go to work.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.520
I've got the first tash-o-gram.
Scotty.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.840
Oh, God.Hah.
Nathan...

18:27.920 --> 18:30.000
and you, Holly.
Ugh.(Nathan chuckles)

18:30.080 --> 18:33.680
Lads, I've got some costumes for you
in the car. I hope you like them.

18:33.760 --> 18:38.040
Holly...
I want you to wear something glam.

18:38.120 --> 18:41.280
Something that
really shows off your assets. Right.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.040
OK?
Hang on a minute.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.480
Holly gets to go all glammed up

18:45.560 --> 18:47.840
but me and Scott
have got to wear costumes?

18:47.920 --> 18:49.320
That doesn't add up.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.240
What is it?
I don't know what they are.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.480
Don't know what it is but it looks
awful.I'm going upstairs.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.360
It's the first day at work
and Anna's taking the piss.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.760
She's literally got us dressed
like tits.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.160
(laughs)
What a belter.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.560
We're going to see a girl

19:05.640 --> 19:08.200
and it looks as though
she's getting a boob job.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.840
I know exactly what that's like.
So she is going to be buzzing.

19:16.640 --> 19:21.560
What the fuck are we doing?
(cheering)

19:21.640 --> 19:24.160
(all laugh)
We've got a little message for you.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.240
"My sweetest darling,
my reddest rose, I love your eyes

19:27.320 --> 19:29.840
but most of all,
I love those massive pillows."

19:29.920 --> 19:33.320
Holly's talking about tits,
there's birds getting new tits,

19:33.400 --> 19:37.120
me and Nathan are dressed as tits.
I am in tit heaven.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.480
"I wanted to write these words
for I love you to bits

19:40.560 --> 19:43.720
and my love is dedicated
to your new pair of cracking tits."

19:43.800 --> 19:45.200
(all laugh and cheer)

19:46.320 --> 19:47.960
(laughs)

19:48.040 --> 19:52.440
My boobs changed my life and
hopefully they'll change hers, too.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.920
Enjoy your tits.
Have a good day. (laughs)

19:55.000 --> 19:57.800
All in all, that was
a boob job well done.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.360
Last night was so quiet.
There was only two girls.

20:05.440 --> 20:08.880
Me, Gaz and Chloe are chilling out,
waiting for Holly and her tits

20:08.960 --> 20:10.960
to get back from work.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.320
(doorbell rings)

20:17.400 --> 20:19.520
Why the fuck
is the doorbell going off?

20:23.280 --> 20:24.960
(doorbell rings)

20:25.440 --> 20:27.480
Why the fuck
is the doorbell going off?

20:28.800 --> 20:31.240
Hi!
(laughs)

20:31.320 --> 20:32.720
Hi!
Hello.

20:34.560 --> 20:39.080
The door opens and in walks some new
bird. She looks like my cup of tea.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.760
You all right? I'm Chantelle.
Nice to meet you.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.280
All right?
Hi, Aaron. All right?

20:44.360 --> 20:47.960
Fucking hell. Just when I'm thinking
of a plan B to get with Scott,

20:48.040 --> 20:51.160
this smoking hot newbie turns up.
She could be competition

20:51.240 --> 20:54.280
that I could do without.
She's got a bottle of Aftershock!

20:54.360 --> 20:57.960
(laughs) Drinking already?
Fucking hell. I like your dress.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.720
This girl bounces through the door,
bottle of vodka in one hand,

21:01.800 --> 21:05.440
shots in the other, full of life.
This is gonna get so interesting.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.080
I'm Chantelle, I'm 25.
I'm a feisty party girl

21:10.160 --> 21:13.640
and I love a good night in the toon.
I've got this. Could wear that.

21:13.720 --> 21:17.280
Do you not think it's revealing?
I like a bit of revealing anyways.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.480
Well. (sighs)
Usually my mam's my drinking partner

21:20.560 --> 21:22.680
but fuck it, I can party with anyone.

21:22.760 --> 21:25.200
Have a good time.Bye.
Have a lovely time.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.480
Love you.I love you.
Have a great time.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.240
I will do.Bye.
I'm single, ready to mingle.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.480
I'm going into
that Geordie Shore house

21:32.560 --> 21:34.960
and I'm gonna play the lads
against each other

21:35.040 --> 21:37.120
cos they've never met a bird like me.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.640
Cheers. Welcome to the house.
Thank you. Nice to meet yous.

21:40.720 --> 21:44.280
I can't believe I'm in the Geordie
Shore house and meeting the gang.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.520
It's a good job I brought this drink
because I am nervous.

21:47.600 --> 21:51.000
I just hope they like us.Your boobs
are massive. Are they real?

21:51.080 --> 21:53.440
Aye.Are they?!
Are you single?

21:53.520 --> 21:54.840
Aye.
Wicked.

21:54.920 --> 21:57.240
Fucking hell, Aaron.
That didn't take long.

21:57.320 --> 22:00.560
Show her where she's sleeping.
Do you wanna see the bedroom?

22:00.640 --> 22:02.400
Now that Marnie's left the house,

22:02.480 --> 22:04.760
Chantelle, you're exactly
what I need.

22:07.800 --> 22:11.200
When Chantelle walked in,
Aaron's tongue hit the floor.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.320
But you've gotta play
your cards right

22:13.400 --> 22:15.080
because when Scott comes back,

22:15.160 --> 22:17.360
he will be on her
like a fat kid on cake.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.320
What's the rest of them like?
I think everyone'll like you

22:22.400 --> 22:24.920
cos you're a bit like me.
But I'm a bit thicker.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.600
I'm thick as fuck, though.
Chloe's a belter lass,

22:27.680 --> 22:30.480
she's made us feel dead welcome.
I think we'll get on.

22:30.560 --> 22:33.000
What do you think about the lads?
They're nice.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.920
Do you think Aaron's good-looking?
I think he's lush.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.360
You've both got tattoos and shit.
I've got the new girl on her own

22:39.440 --> 22:42.920
and it's the perfect opportunity
to put a massive copper on Scott.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.040
Scott's the one
who will fuck you over.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.640
That's why I'm in love with him.
I've never told anyone that before!

22:48.720 --> 22:50.960
Oh!Don't tell anyone.
Come here!I know!

22:53.160 --> 22:56.400
I definitely don't wanna be making
any enemies this early.

22:56.480 --> 22:59.160
So don't worry, Chloe.
I won't go near Scott.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.520
Hi, guys.All right?
Oh, hi!

23:06.600 --> 23:09.960
We get back to the house, we walk in
and there's a new girl there.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.480
What the fuck?
And I'm dressed like this!

23:12.560 --> 23:15.160
Meet the new member of the house.
Hold on a minute.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.440
Fucking fresh fanny?

23:16.520 --> 23:18.920
Are yous having a shot?
Yeah! Come on, then.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.520
Aye! Fucking right.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.920
I'm really missing
my best friend Charlotte

23:24.000 --> 23:26.920
and now some loud, radge girl
has made herself at home.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.440
This is the last thing I need.
Are you single?

23:29.520 --> 23:31.200
Aye, but that doesn't matter.

23:31.280 --> 23:35.200
(all laugh) I'm now Chloe's best pal
so you are off fucking limits!

23:35.280 --> 23:37.680
Nae joy!
I've been proper stitched up here,

23:37.760 --> 23:40.880
like, by Anna and now by Chloe.
She's telling the new bird

23:40.960 --> 23:44.480
that I'm all hers. What a fucking
liberty! I'm not even with her!

23:44.560 --> 23:48.280
Chantelle's saying she's never,
ever gonna go anywhere near Scott.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.800
And I trust her because she's
a radgie and radgies never lie.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.920
Thank you. Cheers, darling. Cheers.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.760
Everyone get ready and we are
fucking going out! Let's go, go, go!

23:59.840 --> 24:02.920
I hope Chantelle's ready
for her first night with the crew

24:03.000 --> 24:05.120
cos tonight we are going in.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.880
Me and the lads are getting ready
and I've definitely got

24:10.960 --> 24:14.200
the most pristine, polished pipe
in the fucking North-East,

24:14.280 --> 24:18.080
ready to graft the arse off
Chantelle. She looks fucking lethal.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.320
I wanna put my face
right up her arsehole.

24:20.400 --> 24:23.880
I'm gonna let Scott go in there all
guns blazing and then fuck it up.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.960
I'll just sit back
and hopefully she'll come to me.

24:28.840 --> 24:32.280
We're all getting ready and I wanna
learn more about this newbie.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.760
What's your type?
Have you got a type?

24:34.840 --> 24:39.280
I love the whole tattoo type.
I love it.There you go. (laughs)

24:39.360 --> 24:42.480
Thank God. Scott's got no tattoos.
Scott's got no tattoos!

24:42.560 --> 24:45.520
I can breathe now, you fucker.
This is gonna be perfect.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.280
Chantelle can get with Aaron,
I can get with Scott.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.000
We can go on double dates!

24:50.080 --> 24:52.160
Cheers! Let's do it!
(all shout)

24:52.240 --> 24:55.040
Everybody's ready.
It's Chantelle's first night

24:55.120 --> 24:58.040
so neck your drinks.
Taxis are here, it's off to town.

25:00.720 --> 25:01.880
Buzzing!

25:05.400 --> 25:07.760
Get to House of Smith
and it's pure bouncing.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.480
It's time to get the party started.
Oi, oi!

25:10.560 --> 25:13.080
(all cheer)

25:17.000 --> 25:20.760
The new girl has hit the dance floor
and I don't know what's more feisty,

25:20.840 --> 25:22.720
her attitude or her dance moves.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.040
It's time to turn on
the Scotty T charm.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.760
Surprise, surprise.
Scott's all over Chantelle.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.040
I need to get Aaron in the game
and quick.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.240
Grow some balls, Aaron!
You've got a long wait

25:46.320 --> 25:48.640
if you think
Chantelle is gonna come to you,

25:48.720 --> 25:51.760
especially with Scott
Fucking Shitty T hanging around.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.920
Chantelle's super confident.
She gets all the lads' attention.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.360
It reminds us of when I was single.
But now I'm in a relationship,

26:01.440 --> 26:04.160
I've gotta stay strong
and avoid the cock.

26:04.240 --> 26:08.000
This girl has been here two minutes.
The girls have welcomed her,

26:08.080 --> 26:10.160
Aaron and Scott
are obsessed with her.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.200
When did walking in
the Geordie Shore house get so easy?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.840
I know Chantelle said
she isn't gonna go there

26:31.920 --> 26:34.200
but seeing them together
makes us jealous.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.240
I really hope that Chloe manages
to keep her shit together

26:41.320 --> 26:44.120
and doesn't kick off cos
that'll bring the mood down.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.200
Trust me, I know. I've been there.

26:49.560 --> 26:53.920
Scott is proper taking over the dance
floor and looks like a right laugh.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.800
I wonder how long him and Chloe
have had a thing for.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.960
This is doing my fucking nut in.
I've told everyone 1,000 times.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.200
I do not fancy Chloe.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.480
There's two sides to every story

27:14.560 --> 27:18.160
and it sounds like Scott was never
into Chloe in the first place.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.800
But I don't see Scott in that way.
Do I?

27:28.280 --> 27:32.840
As I thought, Scott is running hard.
I just hope that he fucks it up.

27:32.920 --> 27:36.640
As for Chloe, it looks like
she's gonna completely flip her lid.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.840
I can't handle watching Scott
graft Chantelle.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.720
I'm just gonna get mortal
and forget about it.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.360
Tonight's been absolutely amazing

27:56.440 --> 27:59.040
but once again,
Chloe has lost her marbles.

27:59.120 --> 28:02.240
Now it's time to get back
to the house. Let's go, let's go!

28:07.760 --> 28:11.080
I was nervous about getting accepted
by the Geordie Shore crew

28:11.160 --> 28:14.080
but so far so good and I think
they're warming to us.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.320
(all shouting)
We've had a wicked night

28:25.400 --> 28:27.640
but it's not over yet.
It's hot tub time.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.040
Chantelle looks wicked
in normal clothes

28:32.120 --> 28:34.320
but she looks even better
in a bikini.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.880
(shrieking)

28:38.440 --> 28:39.440
(squeals)

28:39.520 --> 28:41.760
I go to get in the hot tub
and I fall over.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.200
You know what I'm like,
clumsy as fuck.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.720
It's time to get to know our new
family member a little bit better.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.640
Aaron, here's a brag for you.
Chantelle is gonna pick me over you.

28:59.720 --> 29:00.720
Soz.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.840
Brag.
Brag. Brag.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.000
This is far too easy.

29:18.280 --> 29:20.000
No fucking way.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.800
Brag! Brag.
Brag.

29:27.360 --> 29:32.000
Me. I've got a little something that
I think might blow these lots' minds.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.320
Brag!
(all cheer)

29:44.680 --> 29:48.160
As if this girl could get any
better. I fucking love strippers.

29:50.680 --> 29:54.280
Well, lucky for her that I'm always
carrying round a huge steel pole

29:54.360 --> 29:55.440
in my fucking kegs.

29:57.400 --> 30:01.360
Chantelle reveals that
she used to be a stripper.

30:01.440 --> 30:04.680
They are professional cock teases.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.640
Aaron, Scott, yous are fucked.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.640
It's obvious that Aaron and Scott
fancy Chantelle.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.200
Can't wait to find out
what happens tomorrow.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.640
(groaning)

30:27.720 --> 30:30.520
How was your first night?
Oh, it was belter.

30:30.600 --> 30:34.880
I was fucking mortal, me.
You were crawling around the floor.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.640
Like a chicken or a cat?
Probably more like a dog.

30:37.720 --> 30:41.040
Last night, I let Scott get
under my skin so I got mortal.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.520
We've all been there. If the lad
that you like shows anybody,

30:44.600 --> 30:47.680
doesn't matter who it is,
the slightest bit of attention,

30:47.760 --> 30:49.680
it's just jealousy. It's natural.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.800
Last night Scott told me
there was nothing more than a bang

30:52.880 --> 30:56.400
between him and Chloe,
so I think Chloe needs to let go.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.320
(Scott)Last night was wicked.

31:00.320 --> 31:04.200
Don't even get us started on that.
Fucking pisses me fucking clean off.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.960
Actually, I look at her
in the middle of a night club

31:07.040 --> 31:09.400
and go, "I'm embarrassed
to be with you."

31:09.480 --> 31:12.360
I do feel sorry for Chloe.
She lives in a house with a lad

31:12.440 --> 31:14.240
who wants nothing to do with her.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.360
She needs to get over him
and move on.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.800
Anyways, Scott.
You know what you need to do?

31:18.880 --> 31:21.920
Cos you know you do this.
You flirt with her. Not at all now.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.880
Fuck off.You do.You did it
the first night, don't lie.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.880
That's why I'm not doing anything.
You always say that.

31:27.960 --> 31:30.840
I'm not going near her.
Yesterday I didn't talk to her.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.960
Last night Chloe made a tit
of herself.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.680
When is she gonna learn
that I'm not interested?

31:40.760 --> 31:43.960
Yeah, I'm fucking bored.
I wanna get out this house today.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.560
We've got a new family member

31:45.640 --> 31:48.240
so let's take her out
and get to know her. Bowling?

31:48.320 --> 31:50.840
Bowling's shit.
It's not.Bowling's wicked!

31:50.920 --> 31:53.720
Why don't we just go swimming?
Yes! Let's hit the pool

31:53.800 --> 31:55.800
and throw ourself down some slides.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.640
Girls!

31:57.720 --> 32:00.720
This is perfect.
I love slides, I love swimming

32:00.800 --> 32:04.680
and I love the fact I'm gonna see
Chantelle in a bikini once again.

32:04.760 --> 32:08.160
Listen, girls.
We're gonna take you swimming.

32:08.240 --> 32:10.280
(lads laugh and cheer)

32:10.360 --> 32:13.680
Great call, lads. I've just done
my bloody make-up. Thanks.

32:19.480 --> 32:22.400
(all chatting and laughing)
We get to the swimming pool

32:22.480 --> 32:24.440
and I know I wasn't too excited
before

32:24.520 --> 32:28.360
but now I seen the slide,
I'm absolutely buzzing. Yes-aye!

32:30.960 --> 32:34.800
Me and the girls are walking down
like a scene from Baywatch.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.760
We look sexy and I feel sexy, too.

32:45.640 --> 32:48.560
The only thing better
than Chantelle in a swimsuit

32:48.640 --> 32:50.880
is Chantelle
in a see-through swimsuit.

32:52.200 --> 32:55.200
She must have worn
that swimming costume before.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.400
Of course she knew
it was see-through.

32:58.880 --> 33:02.680
I've only been here two minutes
and they've all seen my tits.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.760
People pay good money to see these.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.720
Fucking hell, that slide was quick.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.040
My balls are bouncing around
in my belly.

33:22.280 --> 33:23.280
(cheering)

33:24.960 --> 33:26.760
Scott's cosying up to Chantelle

33:26.840 --> 33:28.960
and for Chloe this must be
hard to watch.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.240
I just hope she keeps her shit
together.

33:39.160 --> 33:41.280
Since Scott pied us
on the first night,

33:41.360 --> 33:43.320
my head has been all over the place.

33:43.400 --> 33:46.120
And watching him flirt
with Chantelle is upsetting

33:46.200 --> 33:48.840
because I've got feelings
that I can't turn off.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.720
The only way to get through
to Chloe is tough love.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.680
Scott'll bang ya,
but he'll never fucking love ya.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.840
I'm an emotional wreck.
I'm up and down like a yo-yo.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.480
I just don't know what to do.

34:18.680 --> 34:21.920
Scott's idea wasn't so bad
after all. We've had a wicked day

34:22.000 --> 34:26.440
but it's time to get back to
the house and get ready for tonight.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.560
So tonight'll be very interesting.
With Aaron and Scott,

34:29.640 --> 34:32.080
it is a healthy rivalry
when it comes to girls.

34:32.160 --> 34:35.320
But I don't want them to kick off
like they did over Marnie.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.200
It's all friendly and hopefully
it stays like that.

34:38.280 --> 34:42.080
But knowing me and Scott...
(laughs) We're a fucking nightmare.

34:42.160 --> 34:45.800
The more time I spend with Chantelle
the more I think she's all right.

34:45.880 --> 34:49.160
She's confident and canny
and it's good having her around.

34:49.240 --> 34:52.920
At the minute, it's fun and games.
When someone gets to first base,

34:53.000 --> 34:56.880
that's when you're like, "Fuck, I've
lost." That's when it gets naughty.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.840
I do like Chantelle so this time
there's a lot at stake.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.720
I think tonight's gonna be wicked

35:01.800 --> 35:04.360
cos we've had a good family day,
do you not think?

35:04.440 --> 35:08.120
I think I looked on. Fully. Scott
should be dropping at these feet.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.120
Erm, we've already had a conversation
about this today

35:11.200 --> 35:14.000
so the thing with Scott is over,
isn't it?Yeah, it is.

35:14.080 --> 35:17.520
I know I said it a few times but
this time, I can feel it in my soul.

35:17.600 --> 35:21.120
And I've never felt anything in
my soul before. Apart from a cock.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.760
(laughter)I'm not gonna dance
like a complete divvy tonight.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.840
I'm not gonna get too drunk
and I'm not gonna kill Scott.

35:27.920 --> 35:31.040
It'll be hard, but fingers crossed.
Let's fucking go out!

35:31.120 --> 35:33.120
(all) Whoo!

35:33.200 --> 35:37.440
Everyone's dressed and it's time
to party. Let's get fucking mortal.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.120
Get to Florita's,
it's fucking rammed.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.840
This is what it's all about,
party time.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.000
Whoo!

35:54.080 --> 35:56.600
All right, Hol?
Hi.

35:56.680 --> 36:00.360
I've known Holly for ages. Instead
of getting pissed and pulling lads

36:00.440 --> 36:03.080
like a single girl would,
she's acting like a nun.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.160
Everyone thinks I'm quiet because
I'm waiting for Charlotte.

36:17.240 --> 36:20.040
But I'm never gonna act single
because I'm with Kyle.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.560
This is getting awkward.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.560
Holly's obviously missing Charlotte
a lot and so am I.

36:31.640 --> 36:35.040
After Greece, we got on so well
cos we're both in relationships.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.400
So we both want her back.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.800
Tonight, I can feel it,
I'm not gonna kick off.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.920
I want everyone
to have a good night.

36:54.080 --> 36:57.120
I was worried I'd find going out
with the family difficult

36:57.200 --> 37:00.680
now I have a boyfriend. But it means
I can look after Chloe and Holly

37:00.760 --> 37:02.920
and I'm a better friend for it.

37:04.840 --> 37:08.520
It's quite clear Scott and Aaron
are both gonna go for Chantelle

37:08.600 --> 37:10.200
so I've got the perfect idea.

37:26.720 --> 37:30.080
I hope me going on a date with Scott
won't piss Chloe off too much.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.320
I've probably just done Aaron
a favour.

37:33.400 --> 37:36.000
He actually gets some alone time
with Chantelle,

37:36.080 --> 37:38.080
rather than trying to fight Scott.

37:44.880 --> 37:48.120
It is only fair that me and Scott
both take Chantelle on a date.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.920
I suppose I've gotta give him
a fighting chance.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.240
Me and Aaron have been here before.
We've fought over Marnie

38:03.320 --> 38:06.240
and I've got a fucking feeling
it's gonna happen again.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.760
Tonight is amazing
and I still haven't kicked off.

38:11.840 --> 38:15.280
I've surprised myself.
Pat on the back for Chloe!

38:32.520 --> 38:34.240
Chloe is no longer a little girl.

38:34.320 --> 38:37.520
She's become a woman and I'm proud
of her for not kicking off.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.360
I've got myself
in this dating situation

38:43.440 --> 38:45.760
and I wanna talk
to one of the girls about it.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.840
And for obvious reasons, not Chloe.

38:56.240 --> 38:59.240
What the hell? Chantelle is prepared
to piss Chloe off

38:59.320 --> 39:01.320
and let Scott take her out
on a date?

39:01.400 --> 39:04.560
This girl is either very brave
or very fucking stupid.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.120
Problem is, I'm feeling like
a two-faced bitch

39:13.200 --> 39:15.800
cos I told Chloe
I wouldn't go there with Scott.

39:19.200 --> 39:22.400
All in all, tonight's been a success.
Chloe didn't kick off

39:22.480 --> 39:24.720
so it's time to go back to the house.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.440
The fuck are you doing?!

39:39.520 --> 39:43.120
We're missing Charlotte but life
back in Newcastle has been amazing

39:43.200 --> 39:45.520
and the family's in a really good
place now.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.440
Should we go upstairs, Chlo?
Yes. Come on.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.680
Chloe is doing well tonight
but I feel like she might kick off

39:51.760 --> 39:55.360
when she finds out that Chantelle
and Scott are going on a date

39:55.440 --> 39:58.720
so I wanna break the news gently.
I was talking to Chantelle

39:58.800 --> 40:01.240
and she said she's going on one date
with Aaron

40:01.320 --> 40:03.440
and she's going on one date
with Scott.

40:04.200 --> 40:08.760
(exhales) Like, I'm just gonna cry.
I don't understand.

40:08.840 --> 40:12.000
Chantelle's told me
she wouldn't go anywhere near Scott.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.800
What happened to girl code?
I wanted to tell you.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.280
I know they like each other.
I can just tell.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.120
If I was coming into a new family
that I didn't know,

40:20.200 --> 40:22.960
I would never wanna do anything
to piss anyone off.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.800
But Chantelle doesn't give a fuck

40:24.880 --> 40:27.440
and she's gonna do
whatever she wants.

40:27.520 --> 40:29.920
Chantelle is lucky
I'm not that drunk tonight

40:30.000 --> 40:32.240
because it could've been
World War Three.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.680
I'm gonna put my pyjamas on.
I'm over the moon

40:34.760 --> 40:36.840
that I've settled in and I'm buzzing.

40:36.920 --> 40:39.200
I've got two dates
with two belter lads.

40:39.280 --> 40:42.800
I'm hoping it's not gonna cause
any problems with the lasses.

40:42.880 --> 40:45.360
I can't wait to take
my fucking shit off my face.

40:45.440 --> 40:48.120
I'm so gutted I don't even wanna
talk to Chantelle.

40:48.200 --> 40:49.520
I just wanna go to bed.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.640
It's been a wicked night
but I'm gonna get some rest

40:56.720 --> 40:59.720
before the big date tomorrow.
Until then, it's bed time.

41:07.760 --> 41:11.840
I can't sleep and I can't stop
thinking about that fucking date.

41:11.920 --> 41:15.880
I'm raging inside but I can't let
anyone see us kick off.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.920
Fucking hell.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.800
Now I'm feeling
really, really depressed.

41:26.880 --> 41:30.600
Scott is inside my head
and I just can't get him out.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.480
# Everyone's here to party

41:38.560 --> 41:40.480
# If you wanna go wild
You're gonna go wild

41:40.560 --> 41:42.000
# Everyone's here to party

41:42.080 --> 41:44.240
# If you wanna go wild
You're gonna go

41:44.320 --> 41:45.720
# Everyone's here to party

41:45.800 --> 41:48.160
# If you wanna go wild
You're gonna go wild

41:48.240 --> 41:50.520
# Everyone's here to party
Let's party hard

41:50.600 --> 41:52.240
# Gonna go wild
Let's party hard

41:52.320 --> 41:54.640
# We're gonna go wild
Wanna go party

41:54.720 --> 41:59.120
# Let's party hard
# Going hard going hard going hard #

41:59.200 --> 41:59.400
.
