<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:02.586 --> 00:04.383
- I'm your new neighbor.
- Was I playing too loud?

00:04.454 --> 00:06.445
'Cause I'm practicing
for a gig tomorrow.

00:06.523 --> 00:08.616
<i>That guy?
That is your boyfriend?</i>

00:08.692 --> 00:11.388
- What if I get scared?
- Then I'll be right here next to you.

00:11.428 --> 00:14.626
In case you've forgotten, I am
the Editor-in-Chief of this magazine.

00:14.665 --> 00:17.099
In case you've forgotten,
I'm the Editor-in-Chief, too.

00:17.134 --> 00:19.830
You need to bring in someone
to run this business.

00:19.871 --> 00:22.101
Would you have any interest
in coming to Meade?

00:22.139 --> 00:23.970
Danny Meade and I don't quite
get along.

00:24.008 --> 00:26.476
Isn't there a chance
you could put whatever silly issues

00:26.511 --> 00:28.206
you have with him aside?

00:28.246 --> 00:30.271
- We did it.
- That was smooth.

00:30.314 --> 00:33.181
And Wilhelmina has no idea.

"How weird! We're always just, like,
running into each other.

00:51.503 --> 00:53.869
"Hey, Jesse. Hi. Hey. "

00:57.242 --> 01:01.543
Hi, that's so funny. We're always
just, like, running into each other!

01:01.581 --> 01:05.449
Hey, Betty Rocker. I guess we're just
two ships that pass in the morning.

01:09.122 --> 01:10.612
How was work last night?

01:10.690 --> 01:13.523
Thirty four bucks in tips
and the cook spit on me.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.084
Why are you always up so early?

01:15.228 --> 01:18.197
Oh, work. Just so much to do.

01:18.264 --> 01:20.198
Gotta get an early start.
Want some coffee?

01:20.233 --> 01:22.030
The guy at the shop, he gave me two.

01:22.068 --> 01:23.899
It's decaf, 'cause I know
you have to sleep in the morning.

01:23.937 --> 01:25.838
I mean, he knows
that you sleep in the morning.

01:25.873 --> 01:26.965
It was just a coincidence.

01:28.075 --> 01:30.407
Hey, I knocked on your door
last night, but you weren't there.

01:30.477 --> 01:32.502
- But I want to give you something.
- Really?

01:32.546 --> 01:35.310
Yeah, it's a couple of new songs
from my band.

01:35.783 --> 01:38.980
I think it's pretty good.
Or it sucks, I don't know.

01:39.019 --> 01:40.418
But, listen, you have to be brutal.

01:40.487 --> 01:42.182
Because you're always
way too nice to me.

01:42.256 --> 01:45.521
No, no, that's because
I just always like them.

01:45.559 --> 01:48.790
You know, your music is so emotional.

01:48.829 --> 01:52.823
<i>And that song I Made Her Cry,
made me cry.</i>

01:52.867 --> 01:54.391
You're sweet.

01:55.170 --> 01:58.401
Hey, do you know if they fixed the TV
in the laundry room yet?

01:58.440 --> 01:59.839
Because there's
a Miles Davis documentary...

01:59.874 --> 02:01.569
I have a TV!

02:01.610 --> 02:03.544
I mean, you don't have to watch it
in the laundry room.

02:03.578 --> 02:06.376
You could just come over.
You know, I'll be home, just doing stuff.

02:06.414 --> 02:08.176
So knock or whatever.

02:08.216 --> 02:10.582
- All right, thanks, I will.
- Okay.

02:15.958 --> 02:18.984
- So you're going to work?
- Yes! Yes.

02:19.829 --> 02:21.729
Oh.

02:21.764 --> 02:23.129
That way.

02:42.586 --> 02:45.953
- Oh, my God!
- Betty, I thought I heard something.

02:45.989 --> 02:47.980
- What are you doing here?
- Um...

02:48.325 --> 02:50.088
I'm starting work a little early.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.650
- Me, too.
- You're naked!

02:51.728 --> 02:53.992
And you're wearing
a hideous ensemble,

02:54.031 --> 02:55.464
but I'm not all about the obvious.

02:55.499 --> 02:58.127
- Amanda!
- Okay, stop grilling me!

02:58.168 --> 03:01.366
- I kind of got a little evicted.
- What? How?

03:01.406 --> 03:04.068
Can you just
put something on, please?

03:05.543 --> 03:08.740
I didn't pay my rent a couple times,
and they got so nasty about it.

03:08.780 --> 03:11.146
Well, Amanda, you can't live here.

03:11.182 --> 03:13.548
You must have, like, a hundred friends
you could stay with.

03:13.584 --> 03:16.610
- Do you need some money?
- Betty, please, stop caretaking.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.953
God, it's like a disease with you.
And I'm fine here.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.950
One of the boys in security takes care
of me. And I take care of him.

03:25.096 --> 03:26.564
Hey, Zander!

03:31.070 --> 03:34.597
<i>Blind girl, can't you see my love</i>

03:35.307 --> 03:38.936
<i>Blind girl, can't you see my love</i>

03:38.977 --> 03:42.140
<i>Try to tell you, try to show you
try to help...</i>

03:42.181 --> 03:43.341
Hi.

03:43.382 --> 03:45.407
You were singing.

03:45.551 --> 03:47.917
This is my friend Jesse's new song.
It's really good.

03:47.953 --> 03:49.922
Jesse.
I've been hearing that name a lot.

03:49.956 --> 03:52.516
Whatever happened to
"No romantic entanglements"?

03:52.559 --> 03:55.619
- Wasn't that the rule?
- Yes, it's still the rule.

03:55.695 --> 03:57.754
Now, can we please talk about
the "Fashion Heats Up" party?

03:57.831 --> 03:59.560
Because we still don't have a band,

03:59.666 --> 04:02.829
and M.I.A.'s people just called.
Apparently she's on vacation in Brazil,

04:02.869 --> 04:04.393
no one can get a hold of her.

04:04.504 --> 04:06.904
Ooh! Looks like Connor's here.

04:08.908 --> 04:10.466
Man, he is so cool.

04:10.510 --> 04:12.535
Hiring him is the smartest thing
I've ever done.

04:12.579 --> 04:15.879
Yeah, just wait until Wilhelmina finds
out you tricked her to get him here.

04:15.916 --> 04:18.248
Come on, Betty,
I'm tired of her walking all over me.

04:18.285 --> 04:20.651
I need as many people
on Team Daniel as I can get.

04:20.688 --> 04:23.418
Besides, we needed someone to run
the financial arm of this company.

04:23.457 --> 04:26.290
- Connor's the best.
- Well, as a member of Team Daniel,

04:26.327 --> 04:29.057
I fully support you.
Besides, everyone here loves him.

04:29.130 --> 04:32.224
It's always been that way.
At Harvard he was a rock star.

04:32.299 --> 04:35.564
Captain of the crew team,
all the girls loved him.

04:35.970 --> 04:38.769
Man, he got a lot of...

04:38.807 --> 04:41.105
All the girls really loved him.

04:44.012 --> 04:46.480
This is why I hate women, Marc.
They're weak.

04:47.616 --> 04:49.777
Look at them,
throwing themselves at him.

04:49.818 --> 04:52.184
Although I would love to live
in his pants for a year.

04:52.220 --> 04:54.415
You're all fools.

04:54.456 --> 04:55.855
The only thing that matters is that

04:55.891 --> 05:00.021
the new Chief Financial Officer
loathes Daniel Meade.

05:00.061 --> 05:02.656
Which means I'll have an ally.

05:02.732 --> 05:05.132
So, if it's you against Daniel...

05:05.168 --> 05:07.636
He'll always agree with me.

05:07.937 --> 05:10.098
I have to agree with Daniel.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.834
Again?

05:11.874 --> 05:15.275
Well, shooting in the Caribbean
is just more cost-efficient.

05:15.311 --> 05:17.006
And as Daniel's already pointed out...

05:17.046 --> 05:21.107
Yes, yes, yes. Daniel has
had so many great ideas today.

05:21.150 --> 05:22.845
Guess I'm just lucky.

05:22.885 --> 05:25.683
Wilhelmina, I'm just giving you
my honest opinion.

05:25.718 --> 05:28.481
There simply aren't the funds
for your proposal.

05:28.525 --> 05:30.584
Well, then find the funds!

05:31.495 --> 05:33.759
Okay, I'm going to be blunt.

05:33.931 --> 05:36.491
This company owns
too many magazines.

05:36.567 --> 05:39.601
<i>Now if you want to funnel
more money into Mode,</i>

05:39.636 --> 05:42.264
I suggest you have a look at selling off
some of your titles.

05:42.339 --> 05:44.671
Finally, an idea I can agree with.

05:44.708 --> 05:47.040
Now, I have a very strong relationship
with CondÃ© Nast.

05:47.077 --> 05:49.774
- I think there may be interest in a sale.
- No.

05:49.814 --> 05:52.442
We are not selling off
a single magazine.

05:52.483 --> 05:56.886
- They're part of my father's legacy.
- It's ridiculous. Connor, come on!

05:59.591 --> 06:03.152
It may be too drastic.
I'll explore other options.

06:04.863 --> 06:06.353
Excuse me.

06:10.702 --> 06:14.332
Why are you two so chummy?
What the hell is going on here?

06:15.941 --> 06:19.001
I think what's going on, Wilhelmina,

06:19.044 --> 06:21.035
is you've been played.

06:23.315 --> 06:26.546
Why don't you try one of Connor's
donuts? They're really good.

06:31.757 --> 06:34.089
Okay, I've got chips and dip.

06:34.627 --> 06:37.323
And carrot sticks, you know,
in case he's "that guy. "

06:37.363 --> 06:40.561
Now, should I light candles,
or is that too romantic?

06:40.634 --> 06:43.159
But maybe I like candles.
Maybe I'm "that girl. "

06:43.236 --> 06:45.796
If he could be that guy,
I could be that girl, right?

06:46.973 --> 06:50.534
- You are crushing hard.
- Yes, maybe I like him.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.307
But what are the chances
that he's gonna like me back?

06:53.346 --> 06:55.974
Stop it. Henry and Gio
were crazy about you.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.814
That was different. Jesse's an artist.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.013
He writes music, Hilda.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.353
And I get so dorky
when I'm around him.

07:03.391 --> 07:06.827
Honey, please. He's always asking
you to listen to his music.

07:06.894 --> 07:10.694
If a guy needs you to tell him
how great he is, he likes you!

07:11.165 --> 07:12.962
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.092
I don't know.

07:14.135 --> 07:15.898
- Aunt Betty?
- Yeah?

07:16.437 --> 07:19.964
It's not that I don't love what
you're wearing right now, it's very you,

07:20.041 --> 07:23.204
but, maybe for tonight
we can go a little simpler?

07:23.277 --> 07:25.643
Okay, thank you so much for coming.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.273
It was so sweet of you guys to help,

07:27.316 --> 07:28.783
but he's gonna be here any minute,
so get out.

07:28.817 --> 07:32.218
- Okay. Okay. Love you.
- Okay...

07:32.254 --> 07:35.189
- Okay. Thank you. Bye!
- Bye-bye!

07:51.774 --> 07:53.002
Coming!

07:57.880 --> 07:58.972
Hi!

07:59.182 --> 08:03.949
Building management kicked me out.
So I guess we're staying with you.

08:20.804 --> 08:23.967
What is this?
Do you have a boy coming over?

08:24.041 --> 08:25.065
Wait, it is a boy, right?

08:25.142 --> 08:27.235
'Cause I need to know these things
if we're going to be roomies.

08:27.311 --> 08:29.472
Amanda, you can't stay here.

08:29.513 --> 08:31.981
Why?
You said I should stay with a friend.

08:32.015 --> 08:33.347
Yeah, but I meant, like, Marc.

08:33.384 --> 08:36.080
Oh. Uh-uh. I don't want to jeopardize
that friendship.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.780
Besides, Cliff practically lives there.

08:37.821 --> 08:40.552
Okay, you know what?
I would love to help you,

08:40.592 --> 08:43.458
- but right now is not a very good time.
- Betty,

08:43.495 --> 08:45.486
I have nowhere else to go.

08:45.530 --> 08:48.897
Believe it or not,
I don't have that many friends.

08:48.933 --> 08:51.697
Girls just don't seem to like me.

08:51.736 --> 08:54.102
And you were so nice
to me this morning,

08:54.139 --> 08:58.200
I figured you wouldn't mind,
because, you know, you're Betty.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.039
You're a nice person.

09:03.349 --> 09:05.613
- Hey.
- Hey. So, bad news.

09:05.651 --> 09:07.278
I have to cancel tonight.

09:07.319 --> 09:12.256
This friend of mine, or, person of mine,
is having some hard times...

09:12.291 --> 09:14.259
No, that's totally cool.

09:14.293 --> 09:17.057
'Cause I probably wouldn't have
been good company anyway.

09:17.096 --> 09:19.223
We just lost this gig to another band.

09:19.265 --> 09:22.234
- Buffalo Hump, you know those guys?
- No, can't say I do.

09:22.268 --> 09:25.601
- They suck.
- I'm sorry, Jesse,

09:25.638 --> 09:28.737
but don't be discouraged.
Your band is so great.

09:28.772 --> 09:31.836
It's just a matter of time
before it takes off.

09:32.946 --> 09:35.744
Well, you know
what's so cool about you?

09:35.782 --> 09:39.218
I really feel like you mean that.
Thanks, B. You have a good night.

09:39.286 --> 09:40.810
Okay, you, too!

09:42.022 --> 09:45.185
Betty! We're out of dip!
And I'm hungry!

09:46.827 --> 09:50.320
Dude, I have to say,
it's good to have you here.

09:50.364 --> 09:52.855
I think we're going to make
a great team.

09:52.934 --> 09:56.233
Me, too. I put together
a list of ideas to cut costs.

09:56.270 --> 09:58.204
Small things, but I think they add up.

09:58.239 --> 10:02.141
You don't have to run everything
by me. Do what you think is best.

10:02.210 --> 10:05.338
And I know you've got my back.
We're bros.

10:07.748 --> 10:12.185
I hate that stupid fist bump.
Talk to me.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.417
I've been over
and over Connor's contract.

10:14.456 --> 10:17.323
You can't get rid of him
without a huge buyout.

10:17.359 --> 10:19.827
I put that in there
to screw Daniel, not me!

10:19.862 --> 10:22.330
- So what are we going to do?
- Get some dirt on Connor Owens.

10:22.364 --> 10:23.831
Something I can use as leverage.

10:23.866 --> 10:27.529
I will not be constantly overruled
by two silly white boys.

10:27.569 --> 10:28.934
I'm on it.

10:41.451 --> 10:44.318
Oh, my God, we totally match.

10:44.354 --> 10:46.083
<i>Drug taking</i>

10:47.557 --> 10:50.685
You and I are going to have
so much fun.

10:50.894 --> 10:52.259
<i>Merrymaking</i>

10:52.295 --> 10:53.592
<i>Come into my house</i>

10:53.630 --> 10:55.257
<i>You're invited into my house</i>

10:55.298 --> 10:58.699
- Is that my lunch?
- Oh, sorry.

10:58.735 --> 11:00.999
Halston, save some for Betty.

11:01.037 --> 11:02.061
<i>Come into my house</i>

11:02.105 --> 11:04.540
<i>You're invited into my house</i>

11:04.575 --> 11:05.803
<i>Merrymaking</i>

11:07.678 --> 11:09.305
I can't sleep.

11:11.849 --> 11:13.942
What do you want me to do about it?

11:14.018 --> 11:17.954
Sometimes it helps if you tickle
my back and tell me I'm pretty.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.656
<i>You tickled her back?
That's a little bit weird.</i>

11:25.696 --> 11:29.030
I had no choice!
Christina, I needed to get some sleep.

11:29.067 --> 11:32.662
I get it. I've done a lot worse things
to get some sleep, believe me.

11:32.704 --> 11:35.332
Betty, you're gonna have to
kick her out.

11:35.373 --> 11:36.897
But she's got no money.

11:36.942 --> 11:40.571
Well, I don't like the way
she's interfering with your social life.

11:40.612 --> 11:43.012
I want you to take this crush
on to the next level.

11:43.081 --> 11:46.448
I knew it! Betty has a crush!
It's someone from the building, right?

11:46.484 --> 11:48.714
You're always darting in and out
all sweaty and mysterious.

11:48.753 --> 11:53.214
Amanda, it's none of your business.
Are you wearing my leggings?

11:53.259 --> 11:56.490
It's cute, right? And the other leg
makes a matching scarf.

11:56.529 --> 11:58.861
I have to say, I don't hate it.

11:59.532 --> 12:00.897
I know who your lover is.

12:00.933 --> 12:03.902
It's that troll from 3G
who walks his guinea pig on a leash.

12:03.936 --> 12:05.733
When are you two crazy kids
gonna go out?

12:05.771 --> 12:07.671
It's not the guy with the guinea pig!

12:07.707 --> 12:09.174
And I'm not going out with anybody,

12:09.208 --> 12:12.837
because I don't even know
if this guy likes me.

12:13.145 --> 12:16.115
<i>Here's what you do. Invite him
to the Mode party. It'll be totally cas.</i>

12:16.149 --> 12:18.208
That's a good idea.
There'll be loads of people there,

12:18.285 --> 12:21.186
- and it won't even feel like a date.
- And if he turns out to be a serial killer,

12:21.221 --> 12:25.282
he can just find someone else
to cut into pieces. You're welcome.

12:27.261 --> 12:29.126
So what do you think?

12:30.063 --> 12:32.224
<i>I think I'm going to ask Jesse
to the Mode party.</i>

12:33.834 --> 12:35.131
Stop.

12:36.837 --> 12:38.464
Hey there, sexy!

12:38.573 --> 12:40.097
Hey, big-tiny.

12:40.141 --> 12:42.507
Can we please work on a better
nickname for me?

12:42.543 --> 12:44.374
What? It's cute.

12:44.412 --> 12:46.505
So, after work, let's meet at Prune,

12:46.547 --> 12:49.072
because if I don't get a parsley
and dandelion salad,

12:49.150 --> 12:53.450
I swear to Barbra I'm going to throw
a fit with the fury of a thousand queens!

12:53.488 --> 12:55.786
- Move in with me.
- What? What did... What did you say?

12:55.823 --> 12:58.883
Move in with me.

12:59.861 --> 13:03.389
I mean, we spend
all our time together anyway.

13:03.432 --> 13:04.797
I mean, doesn't it just make sense?

13:04.833 --> 13:07.495
Um, we should definitely talk about that

13:07.536 --> 13:10.673
because it definitely bears
further discussion.

13:11.740 --> 13:14.766
Marc!
- Coming, Willie! Oh, my God!

13:14.810 --> 13:18.075
This day could not get any crazier.
Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy!

13:18.113 --> 13:19.637
There's just so much to do.

13:19.682 --> 13:22.173
In fact, I don't even know if I'm gonna
be able to do dinner tonight.

13:22.251 --> 13:27.918
Well... We'll talk later,
or tomorrow, and... Okay!

13:36.466 --> 13:38.661
- Hi, Jesse!
- Hey.

13:38.702 --> 13:41.466
- I was just thinking about you.
- Really? Why?

13:41.504 --> 13:45.565
Well, I was thinking about you because

13:45.608 --> 13:48.133
- I was wondering...
- Yeah?

13:48.812 --> 13:51.475
<i>Mode is having this party
for global warming.</i>

13:51.515 --> 13:52.948
It's not "for" global warming, obviously,

13:52.983 --> 13:55.850
because global warming is bad.
It's for "awareness," yay!

13:55.920 --> 13:59.879
Anyway, I'm in charge of finding
the band, it's gonna be fun, and...

14:00.024 --> 14:01.992
- So I was thinking...
- If I could play?

14:02.026 --> 14:04.517
<i>You want Dark Sexual Journey
to play at a Mode party?</i>

14:04.562 --> 14:06.996
- Oh, my... This is amazing!
- Oh, no, Jesse. I think you...

14:07.031 --> 14:09.625
Do you know what kind of exposure
this will be for us? For me?

14:09.667 --> 14:11.100
You're the coolest girl ever!

14:14.071 --> 14:17.667
Oh, my God, Betty.
I was just so depressed today.

14:17.709 --> 14:21.201
You know, like,
I was like this close to just...

14:21.246 --> 14:23.840
Whatever, I'll put it in a song. But just...

14:23.882 --> 14:29.081
You really, really cheered me up.
I mean, you're a snow day, Betty!

14:38.730 --> 14:42.132
Hey, Daniel, good news!
We're no longer bandless!

14:42.168 --> 14:44.068
I found someone
to play at the party on Friday!

14:44.103 --> 14:48.062
You know what? Already done.
Guess what? We got Mariah Carey.

14:48.107 --> 14:50.541
Turns out Connor knows her.
Isn't that great?

14:53.379 --> 14:55.176
Yeah, I mean, Mariah's all right.

14:55.214 --> 14:57.682
But could we just put a pin in her
for a second?

14:57.717 --> 15:00.880
Because I think I found someone
way fresher.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.118
- Jesse's band, Dark Sexual Journey.
- Huh...

15:04.191 --> 15:06.659
They're awesome. And they're about
to break out any minute.

15:06.693 --> 15:08.752
- You'll love them.
- Okay. Great.

15:08.829 --> 15:11.730
Yeah, let me just get Mariah
on the phone.

15:12.733 --> 15:16.635
Hey, Mariah, it's Daniel. Yeah, turns
out we're not gonna need you to sing.

15:16.737 --> 15:20.298
Uh-huh. We got Jesse.
The guy from my assistant's building.

15:20.340 --> 15:23.309
He is so cute.
Yes, he is just the dreamiest.

15:23.343 --> 15:25.573
I hate when you're sarcastic.

15:26.380 --> 15:28.713
I can't move in with Cliff, right?

15:28.750 --> 15:32.948
I mean, this is just such a big step.
Sometimes I think, "I love this guy,"

15:32.987 --> 15:36.479
and then sometimes I think, "What am
I doing with him?" Am I terrible?

15:36.558 --> 15:39.584
- No, baby, you're just scared.
- I am.

15:39.661 --> 15:43.028
Look, all I know is
that living with a fatty is hard.

15:43.064 --> 15:44.429
They're always hogging the bed

15:44.466 --> 15:46.866
and making a mess
and borrowing your clothes.

15:46.901 --> 15:49.131
- By the way, loving this dress.
- It's Betty's blouse.

15:49.170 --> 15:51.036
- I totally belted it.
- It's great.

15:57.246 --> 16:00.443
- Is it good?
- Very. I made a few calls,

16:00.483 --> 16:02.474
cashed in a few favors, and...
Yeah, right, sorry.

16:02.518 --> 16:03.849
You're not about the process.

16:03.886 --> 16:06.719
There's lots of juicy tidbits
about Connor's past.

16:07.857 --> 16:08.915
Females.

16:10.059 --> 16:12.527
Have Connor come to my office
after work.

16:12.561 --> 16:14.153
I think I can make
a persuasive argument

16:14.230 --> 16:17.257
as to whom he should be
aligning himself with.

16:19.936 --> 16:22.871
I don't think you've got any choice,
Betty, but to tell the truth.

16:22.906 --> 16:25.739
- He can't play at the party.
- I know.

16:25.775 --> 16:27.902
Two shawarmas
with everything, please.

16:27.944 --> 16:29.844
But you should've seen his little face.

16:30.981 --> 16:32.812
He's gonna be so disappointed.

16:32.849 --> 16:35.147
And he's going to hate me
before I even know if he likes me.

16:35.185 --> 16:39.088
- Bring it. Who's going to hate you?
- No one! Why are you always around?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.557
Betty, we're roomies now.
This is what we do.

16:41.626 --> 16:45.494
I'm supposed to be all up in your biz.
So, why the brown face?

16:45.897 --> 16:49.230
<i>Betty told this boy that she really likes
that he could play at the Mode party,</i>

16:49.267 --> 16:51.997
but Daniel got Mariah Carey.

16:52.036 --> 16:54.368
What? Well, she's going to find out
sooner or later, isn't she?

16:54.405 --> 16:57.135
Yes, I will. So, it's a musician?

16:57.174 --> 17:00.302
- Are you wearing my blouse?
- Don't change the subject.

17:00.344 --> 17:03.040
Here's what you do.
Invite him to play at the after party.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.548
There aren't any after parties.

17:04.616 --> 17:07.710
Um, what about the one we are having
on our roof?

17:07.752 --> 17:11.086
It totally just came to me.
Your guy will have a place to play,

17:11.123 --> 17:13.887
and I can charge money at the door
and pay off my credit cards.

17:13.925 --> 17:16.588
Aren't you so glad that I moved in?

17:23.135 --> 17:24.568
Damn it!

17:25.871 --> 17:28.500
- You okay?
- No, I'm wet.

17:29.876 --> 17:32.003
Why did you replace
our nice bottled water

17:32.045 --> 17:34.513
with glasses
we now have to fill ourselves?

17:34.547 --> 17:36.811
Why don't you just hang
a hamster bottle in the corner

17:36.849 --> 17:38.714
and we can all take turns sipping off it?

17:38.751 --> 17:40.616
Mom, relax, okay?

17:40.653 --> 17:43.178
It's probably just
one of Connor's cost-cutting ideas.

17:43.222 --> 17:46.783
Like that memo telling us we now have
to sign out a key for the supply room?

17:46.826 --> 17:48.589
Is that Connor's idea as well?

17:48.661 --> 17:50.856
I told him he didn't have to run
everything by me.

17:50.930 --> 17:53.525
You be careful, Daniel.
This is a pattern with you.

17:53.601 --> 17:56.195
Whenever you admire someone,
you tend to give your power away.

17:56.270 --> 17:59.239
- Just like you did with your brother.
- That's not true.

17:59.273 --> 18:02.902
And that's beside the point.
I hired Connor because he's the best.

18:02.943 --> 18:05.571
- And because I can trust him.
- Good.

18:05.779 --> 18:06.939
Then I suppose you're not worried

18:06.981 --> 18:11.008
that he and Wilhelmina
are meeting together tonight. Privately.

18:11.885 --> 18:13.853
Did you not know that?

18:14.455 --> 18:17.357
You see, I make it a point

18:17.392 --> 18:20.884
to know everything
Wilhelmina Slater is up to.

18:20.929 --> 18:24.592
And if they're meeting alone,
I don't like it.

18:24.799 --> 18:28.963
There are a million reasons why
they could be meeting. Don't worry.

18:29.638 --> 18:31.538
Connor's got my back.

18:40.983 --> 18:42.541
What is this?

18:42.985 --> 18:45.715
It looks like a flyer for a rodeo
at a women's prison.

18:45.755 --> 18:47.689
What? I like it.

18:47.723 --> 18:51.386
Betty, no one will come to a party
with a flyer like this.

18:51.961 --> 18:54.327
Fine. How would you do it?

18:56.265 --> 18:58.358
But how will people know where to go?

18:58.434 --> 18:59.992
They won't even know
what time to show up.

19:00.069 --> 19:02.765
If they want to be there badly enough,
they'll figure all that out.

19:02.805 --> 19:04.706
You have to make it hard
to get on the list.

19:04.741 --> 19:07.039
That way, the party will be
full of people desperate to be there,

19:07.077 --> 19:09.602
and they'll think it's great, no matter
how much of a humongous turd

19:09.646 --> 19:12.740
- it turns out to be.
- Um, I don't know.

19:13.283 --> 19:15.444
Trust me, roomie...

19:16.687 --> 19:20.521
<i>All of the boys and the girls
here, in Paris</i>

19:20.557 --> 19:24.425
<i>Sing to the night without sight,
but with madness</i>

19:24.461 --> 19:28.296
<i>I can't keep up, I'm a wreck,
but I want it</i>

19:28.332 --> 19:32.325
<i>Tell me the truth,
is it love or just Paris</i>

19:32.403 --> 19:36.134
<i>All of the boys and the girls
here, in Paris</i>

19:36.174 --> 19:40.042
<i>Sing to the night without sight,
but with madness</i>

19:40.078 --> 19:41.670
<i>I can't keep up, I'm a wreck</i>

19:42.814 --> 19:45.578
300 people. Cool, right?

19:45.616 --> 19:49.882
- Wow, that is a lot of people.
- Yes, it is.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.250
I'm glad we're gonna have this chance

19:55.294 --> 19:57.125
to get to know each other
better, Connor.

19:57.162 --> 20:00.393
I find it helps improve
a work relationship.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.990
- Me, too.
- Good, 'cause, you know, I'm confused.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.163
I was... I was led to believe
that you and Daniel...

20:06.205 --> 20:08.571
Just how bad is that headache?

20:08.607 --> 20:12.373
- I'm sorry?
- You've been doing that a lot.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.675
Well, it's been quite a day.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.871
I can get rid of that for you.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.316
No, thank you,
that's what drugs are for.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.650
Come on. Let me.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.923
I'm better for your liver.

20:25.992 --> 20:29.428
You know why you get them?
Too many ideas in your head.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.295
And not enough time in the day
to get them out.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.665
Even if you could,
who would you trust them with?

20:36.603 --> 20:40.267
It's a lot of pressure,
having only yourself to depend on.

20:41.609 --> 20:45.875
I get headaches, too. So, how is it?

20:49.817 --> 20:53.617
- It's gone.
- Good. Shall we continue our talk?

20:54.288 --> 20:58.691
Now, my guess is,
a woman such as yourself

20:58.726 --> 21:01.354
would have
a bottle of '61 single-malt Scotch

21:01.395 --> 21:04.024
floating around the place somewhere.

21:04.366 --> 21:05.458
Uh...

21:06.168 --> 21:09.763
- '48.
- Perfect. Older is always better.

21:09.838 --> 21:13.171
I wouldn't know.
I've been the same age for years.

21:13.542 --> 21:16.739
You know, Wilhelmina,
you're the reason I'm here.

21:17.913 --> 21:22.907
Something tells me
I could learn a lot from you.

21:30.193 --> 21:34.527
<i>I've been really trying, baby</i>

21:36.065 --> 21:40.365
<i>Trying to hold back
this feeling for so long</i>

21:41.971 --> 21:46.431
<i>And if you feel like I feel, baby</i>

21:46.742 --> 21:50.838
<i>Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon</i>

21:51.915 --> 21:53.314
<i>Let's get it on</i>

21:54.418 --> 21:56.750
<i>Ah, baby</i>

21:57.321 --> 21:59.846
<i>Let's get it on</i>

21:59.957 --> 22:02.187
Are you okay? You seem distracted.

22:08.632 --> 22:13.660
It's just because I...
I just remembered that I have a dinner.

22:13.704 --> 22:18.267
I'll call Marc and have him reschedule.

22:23.781 --> 22:25.214
300 people!

22:25.250 --> 22:28.447
I thought I was making food for 50,
maybe 60 at the most.

22:28.486 --> 22:32.422
Well, you can thank Amanda.
I had no idea it was gonna get this big.

22:32.457 --> 22:35.255
<i>But, papi, what am I gonna do?
I promised Jesse.</i>

22:35.293 --> 22:37.625
Sweetheart, why are you going
to so much trouble for a boy?

22:37.662 --> 22:41.326
<i>- Because she likes him, papi.
- I do. I do like him.</i>

22:41.367 --> 22:42.925
And I shouldn't even be saying that.

22:42.968 --> 22:45.061
A guy is the last thing
I should be thinking about.

22:45.104 --> 22:47.334
Why?
You're young, you have a good job,

22:47.373 --> 22:48.601
your own apartment.

22:48.674 --> 22:52.371
Yeah, and you're wearing heels
sometimes. Thank God.

22:53.012 --> 22:55.913
<i>- He's nice to you, mi hija?
- So nice.</i>

22:55.948 --> 22:58.143
But I can't. I can't do this.
I have to cancel.

22:58.183 --> 22:59.445
I can't afford this party.

22:59.485 --> 23:02.454
You guys are thinking about this
all wrong. Okay?

23:02.489 --> 23:04.047
It doesn't have to cost that much.

23:04.090 --> 23:06.115
<i>You know, I was reading
in Vanity Fair one time</i>

23:06.159 --> 23:10.095
that going budget is totally in now.
Like, cheap is the new chic!

23:10.130 --> 23:11.927
Well, cheap we can work with.

23:11.965 --> 23:13.933
Maybe I can get a discount
at Flushing Burgers,

23:13.967 --> 23:16.458
cut up a bunch of Jumbos,
do a mole for dipping.

23:17.003 --> 23:18.527
And we could make
a ton of sangria.

23:18.571 --> 23:22.735
Cheap wine, old fruit, a box of sugar.
People get drunk, they don't care.

23:22.809 --> 23:24.709
- Drinking is bad.
- Okay.

23:24.744 --> 23:27.076
So, we have a theme,
"South of the Border. "

23:27.280 --> 23:29.579
<i>And then we could use the
decorations from my quinceaÃ±era.</i>

23:29.617 --> 23:31.175
- Good idea.
- That's such a great idea!

23:31.252 --> 23:33.743
Tacky Mexican stuff is so kitschy!

23:34.355 --> 23:36.482
What? I'm allowed to say that.
It's my heritage.

23:36.524 --> 23:40.290
And, guys, thank you.
You always come through for me.

23:40.728 --> 23:44.494
You're like a total snow day!
That's a good thing!

23:45.299 --> 23:46.630
Okay.

23:49.904 --> 23:54.399
So, how did it go with Connor?
Did you break him? Did he cry?

23:54.643 --> 23:56.975
Do I need to offer him
a comforting hug?

23:57.045 --> 23:58.137
Check my calendar, please.

23:58.213 --> 24:00.078
What, that's it?
You're not going to tell me anything?

24:00.115 --> 24:02.379
After all the work I did
to dig up that dirt?

24:02.417 --> 24:04.749
I didn't use it. It wasn't the time.

24:04.786 --> 24:06.185
So, when will be the time?

24:06.221 --> 24:08.189
Since when are you
such a nosey-parker?

24:08.223 --> 24:11.283
Your job is to do what I say
and not ask any questions!

24:12.427 --> 24:15.555
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- Oh, no.

24:15.597 --> 24:18.863
Connor, my door is always open.

24:18.901 --> 24:21.927
I just wanted to let you know
I'd be out most of the day.

24:21.971 --> 24:25.304
- Hey, how was that dinner last night?
- It was fun!

24:25.375 --> 24:27.536
Just delightful. Thank you for asking.

24:27.577 --> 24:30.444
I'll see you
at the "Fashion Heats Up" party.

24:32.248 --> 24:35.513
Fun? Delightful?
You didn't have a dinner last night.

24:35.551 --> 24:37.314
You don't even eat dinner!

24:37.353 --> 24:39.651
Oh, my God, you like him!

24:40.591 --> 24:43.890
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Willie, you saluted him!

24:43.927 --> 24:46.657
You haven't saluted anyone
since Cheney.

24:46.697 --> 24:48.995
You have fallen for him
like everyone else here.

24:49.033 --> 24:51.194
I don't fall for anyone, Marc!

24:51.235 --> 24:54.170
I am not like those other women
out there, ruled by their emotions.

24:54.204 --> 24:57.367
Willie, it's okay to feel something.

24:57.574 --> 25:00.668
No, it's not!
Not when it gets in the way of ambition.

25:00.778 --> 25:02.769
How do you think I got this far?

25:02.813 --> 25:07.547
Now, I've had my momentary lapse
of judgment, but that is over now.

25:08.119 --> 25:11.953
- So, what are you going to do now?
- Finish what I started.

25:11.990 --> 25:14.618
That party is going to get
a lot more interesting.

25:19.998 --> 25:21.124
Marc.

25:23.902 --> 25:26.837
- I didn't even see you there.
- What's going on, Marc?

25:27.372 --> 25:28.965
I asked you a really important question

25:29.008 --> 25:30.976
and then you don't call me back
for three days?

25:31.010 --> 25:35.106
I'm so sorry,
it has just been non-stop around here.

25:35.147 --> 25:36.910
What, with the blackmailing,
backstabbing,

25:36.982 --> 25:38.244
and going on Pinkberry runs,

25:38.317 --> 25:40.979
I've barely even had time
to take the curlers out of my hair!

25:41.053 --> 25:43.920
Is there still one back there?

25:46.392 --> 25:50.192
Why is the idea of moving in with me
so hard?

25:51.330 --> 25:53.595
It's just big!

25:53.633 --> 25:56.568
It's like deciding to get a kid.
How do you know it's the right time?

25:56.603 --> 25:59.163
Or what kind to get?
I mean, do you go Russian, Chinese,

25:59.206 --> 26:00.798
or stay local
and do something South American?

26:00.907 --> 26:03.375
And then what if you're wrong
and it clashes with your furniture?

26:03.410 --> 26:07.176
Forget it, Marc!
You gave me your answer.

26:14.855 --> 26:17.620
So, I have a car picking you up
at your party at 10:30

26:17.658 --> 26:19.751
so you can be at my party by 11:00.

26:19.794 --> 26:22.388
Do you think it's weird
that I've left two messages for Connor

26:22.430 --> 26:23.761
and he hasn't called me back?

26:23.798 --> 26:25.732
No, he's probably just in a place
where he can't answer.

26:25.766 --> 26:29.702
I'm his boss. He should be letting me
know where he's gonna be all day.

26:29.737 --> 26:31.500
Is everything okay?

26:32.273 --> 26:36.039
Yeah. Everything's fine.
It's just something my mom said.

26:36.077 --> 26:38.068
You know what? You should go home
and get ready for your party.

26:38.112 --> 26:42.277
I will. And, Daniel,
thank you so much for that donation.

26:42.317 --> 26:44.911
<i>Well, it is the Mode after party.</i>

26:44.987 --> 26:48.684
Besides, I heard the singer of the band
is just to die for.

26:48.724 --> 26:50.316
Why do I tell you anything?

27:00.802 --> 27:03.999
I'm sorry, you're not on this list.

27:04.039 --> 27:07.476
But perhaps a crisp George
Washington could persuade me.

27:07.510 --> 27:09.876
That means a $20!

27:17.787 --> 27:19.152
Here you go.

27:20.557 --> 27:22.991
Not so fast, gorgeous.
Momma owes the government.

27:26.663 --> 27:29.827
See, the trick to a good mole
is cinnamon.

27:30.935 --> 27:33.802
- Cool, now can I wear your hat?
- Don't touch the hat.

27:34.004 --> 27:36.529
Oh, my God, what a turnout.

27:36.574 --> 27:38.064
It's like everybody's showing up!

27:38.108 --> 27:40.906
<i>I think one of the understudies from
Spamalot just used my bathroom.</i>

27:40.945 --> 27:43.607
- No!
- And have you seen Jesse?

27:43.647 --> 27:45.274
'Cause I think the band wants to start.

27:45.316 --> 27:47.011
Oh, yeah, I think I saw him downstairs.

27:47.051 --> 27:52.353
Betty, he's so cute. All sad
and tortured. I see why you like him.

27:52.423 --> 27:53.948
- Right?
- I know!

27:57.796 --> 27:59.491
Finally! Connor left me a message.

27:59.531 --> 28:02.125
Why wasn't he at that dreadful party?

28:02.167 --> 28:04.533
If I had to sit and listen
to Scarlett Johansson

28:04.569 --> 28:07.163
babble about climate change,
he should have.

28:07.205 --> 28:11.369
He said his meeting went late,
he's gonna see me at the after party.

28:11.409 --> 28:13.741
<i>SUZUKl: Drama at Casa del Meade.</i>

28:13.812 --> 28:15.871
<i>Word on the boulevard
is that Meade Publications</i>

28:15.914 --> 28:17.815
<i>is selling off some magazines.</i>

28:17.883 --> 28:20.374
<i>My anonymous source
Reginald has confirmed</i>

28:20.419 --> 28:22.683
<i>that Meade's new CFO,
Connor Owens,</i>

28:22.755 --> 28:25.918
<i>met with CondÃ© Nast
for several hours this afternoon.</i>

28:26.125 --> 28:29.094
- He's working with Wilhelmina?
- I'm sorry, Daniel.

28:29.128 --> 28:30.891
He's gonna be, too.

28:33.899 --> 28:36.697
Hi, welcome, welcome, have fun.

28:37.603 --> 28:42.405
Jesse? What are you doing out here?
The band's ready to start.

28:42.809 --> 28:44.276
Are you okay?

28:44.711 --> 28:48.613
- It's too big. I can't do that.
- Of course you can.

28:48.649 --> 28:52.642
- No, I... What if I suck?
- There's no way you could suck.

28:52.686 --> 28:55.587
You're just... You're just having
a little bit of stage fright.

28:55.689 --> 28:58.783
I'm a fake, Betty.
I just don't think I have it.

28:58.859 --> 29:01.157
Yes, you do.

29:01.261 --> 29:05.824
Look, maybe you can't feel it right now,
but it's in there. I can see it.

29:05.867 --> 29:09.234
And these bad thoughts,
that's what's fake.

29:09.270 --> 29:11.966
As soon as you get up there
and start playing,

29:12.006 --> 29:14.702
everyone else is gonna see what I do.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.414
- All right.
- Okay.

29:22.750 --> 29:23.876
Okay.

29:25.019 --> 29:28.455
God, Betty, you're so beautiful.
Thank you.

29:38.267 --> 29:39.564
<i>I'll try my best</i>

29:39.601 --> 29:42.729
<i>Either you live your life
or you sit witness</i>

29:42.771 --> 29:45.797
<i>While a look-alike
comes and steals your bliss</i>

29:45.841 --> 29:47.741
<i>So, come on</i>

29:47.776 --> 29:50.677
<i>Get on with it</i>

29:51.413 --> 29:54.440
<i>We're just wasting time</i>

29:54.484 --> 29:56.076
Isn't he amazing?

29:56.119 --> 29:58.178
Yeah, but Ivanka Trump
just put a burger in her purse,

29:58.221 --> 30:00.246
so I have to go call Randy.
Okay, love you, bye.

30:00.290 --> 30:01.450
Okay.

30:01.491 --> 30:03.857
<i>Get on with it</i>

30:03.927 --> 30:06.623
<i>We're just wasting time</i>

30:08.198 --> 30:11.497
Hey! So, I think
I figured out who Betty's crush is.

30:11.534 --> 30:13.195
It's that old guy over there.

30:14.671 --> 30:16.366
- That's her father.
- Oh.

30:16.606 --> 30:19.041
Mandy, Cliff won't call me back.

30:19.076 --> 30:21.169
He's mad because he thinks
I don't want to move in with him.

30:21.212 --> 30:23.271
- But you don't.
- Well, why should I?

30:23.381 --> 30:25.246
Everything was fine before.

30:26.384 --> 30:28.875
We had our lives
and our hair products separate.

30:28.919 --> 30:32.047
Everyone looked good
and nothing changed!

30:33.190 --> 30:37.991
- Why does he want to ruin that?
- Marc, are you really mad at Cliff?

30:38.062 --> 30:40.553
Or are you starting
to have doubts about him?

30:40.631 --> 30:43.465
Oh, my God,
they put out cake!

30:44.369 --> 30:46.894
Do what you want! I'm sure you'll make
the right decision! Bye.

30:46.938 --> 30:51.466
<i>...always come to a head
over a glass of wine and a cigarette</i>

30:51.510 --> 30:54.707
<i>You got a little dagger stuck
inside my chest</i>

30:54.746 --> 30:58.273
<i>I'm about as ready now
as I'll ever get</i>

31:03.922 --> 31:05.015
<i>Thanks.</i>

31:06.259 --> 31:09.820
<i>So I want to try a little solo something</i>

31:10.062 --> 31:13.657
<i>and dedicate this
to someone here who's...</i>

31:14.333 --> 31:16.392
<i>She's just really special.</i>

31:22.642 --> 31:26.009
<i>Every day just blurs into one</i>

31:27.747 --> 31:31.240
<i>The moon starts to look
just like the sun</i>

31:33.153 --> 31:36.520
<i>Full steam ahead
day to night</i>

31:38.392 --> 31:42.385
<i>Never fully charged
Never quite right</i>

31:43.096 --> 31:46.554
<i>But she was a snowy day</i>

31:46.633 --> 31:53.506
<i>A break from working hard
for such little pay</i>

31:54.242 --> 31:57.473
<i>Yeah, she was a snowy day</i>

31:57.745 --> 32:04.514
<i>She let me get some rest
She let me sleep real late</i>

32:06.020 --> 32:10.582
<i>So I could fight another day</i>

32:11.926 --> 32:16.158
<i>She was a snowy day</i>

32:16.231 --> 32:19.668
- Is everyone enjoying themselves?
- Who cares?

32:20.135 --> 32:23.468
He dedicated a song to you!
He likes you.

32:23.506 --> 32:27.408
I don't know. I mean, I think he does.
Earlier he told me I was beautiful.

32:28.511 --> 32:31.378
What more do you need, girl?
Go ask him out!

32:31.413 --> 32:34.280
- I know, I should, shouldn't I?
- Yes!

32:34.316 --> 32:38.446
Okay, I will. I will.
I should probably do that now?

32:38.487 --> 32:40.455
- Yes, yes. Ready?
- Okay.

32:41.591 --> 32:43.752
- Here I go.
- Go. Go!

32:46.062 --> 32:49.361
Hi, Miss Slater. How are you?
It's good to see you.

32:51.034 --> 32:54.902
- You a friend of Betty's?
- What? God, no.

32:54.938 --> 32:58.339
She's a nice girl.
I live right below her. 4G.

32:58.775 --> 33:02.370
- Am I to understand I'm on Betty's roof?
- Yeah.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.043
<i>If you get that feeling</i>

33:09.086 --> 33:11.350
<i>But you can't describe it</i>

33:11.389 --> 33:14.620
<i>It's okay, I hope you like it</i>

33:14.659 --> 33:16.559
<i>When you get that feeling</i>

33:16.594 --> 33:18.824
<i>But you can't describe it</i>

33:18.863 --> 33:21.933
<i>All you know is that you like it</i>

33:21.968 --> 33:23.696
You look beautiful.

33:23.768 --> 33:25.497
I think we're done with the charm,
aren't we?

33:25.570 --> 33:28.539
Listen, I know you're in bed
with Daniel, so let me be blunt.

33:28.606 --> 33:30.438
You start playing for my side,

33:30.475 --> 33:33.911
or I will reveal some things about you
you probably don't want out there.

33:33.946 --> 33:36.073
Wilhelmina, can we go somewhere
and talk?

33:36.114 --> 33:38.844
Connor, I know all about your meetings
at CondÃ© Nast.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.681
What the hell happened to our deal?

33:40.719 --> 33:43.210
I'm not gonna have you two
conspiring behind my back.

33:43.255 --> 33:46.088
I don't care what your contract says,
I want you out of here.

33:46.124 --> 33:48.752
Daniel, do you know how much
it's gonna cost to fire a man like this?

33:48.794 --> 33:51.194
You won't need to. I'll walk right now.

33:51.229 --> 33:53.357
God, you two are children!

33:54.400 --> 33:57.927
I played your game to get the job,
but that is where it ends.

33:58.004 --> 34:00.905
I took the meeting because you
asked me to exercise my judgment.

34:00.974 --> 34:05.638
Which is this, that selling off a couple
of magazines makes financial sense.

34:05.678 --> 34:08.976
Far more sense than preserving
your father's legacy at any cost.

34:09.014 --> 34:12.212
And you, whatever it is you think
you've got on me, let it out.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.913
I tell you what, I'll even help you.
Drugs?

34:14.954 --> 34:19.016
I've done pretty much everything.
I've slept with my best friend's wife.

34:19.059 --> 34:22.027
Oh, here's a great one.
My first job at Smith Barney?

34:22.062 --> 34:24.690
I overhear two guys in an elevator
trading stock tips,

34:24.732 --> 34:27.166
I end up losing my shirt
and I almost go to jail.

34:27.201 --> 34:28.565
But I turned my life around.

34:28.601 --> 34:31.230
I made myself into somebody
that I can be proud of.

34:31.304 --> 34:34.866
So, if you want me to do the job
that you hired me for, fine.

34:34.942 --> 34:38.746
But if you want me to pick sides,
forget it!

34:38.781 --> 34:43.047
I'm nobody's bitch! I need a drink.

34:50.158 --> 34:52.649
Jesse, are you in there?

34:58.400 --> 35:01.699
- Sorry!
- Jeez, Betty, ever hear of knocking?

35:11.113 --> 35:12.740
Betty, wait! Betty, wait!

35:12.782 --> 35:14.647
Betty, it was bound to happen
sooner or later.

35:14.684 --> 35:16.208
Next time,
I'll just leave a bra on the doorknob.

35:16.252 --> 35:18.914
You are the worst roommate ever!

35:18.954 --> 35:23.015
You're selfish and insensitive,
and I want you out!

35:23.059 --> 35:25.493
Just be gone by tomorrow morning!

35:38.075 --> 35:41.841
Connor, I want to apologize
for my behavior.

35:42.779 --> 35:45.247
I always blackmail people
when I'm nervous.

35:45.315 --> 35:47.579
It's just kind of my go-to.

35:54.358 --> 35:57.623
There aren't a lot of nice people
in this business.

35:57.662 --> 36:02.565
I didn't expect to meet someone
who actually has integrity.

36:04.402 --> 36:05.801
Thank you.

36:07.705 --> 36:09.070
We need you.

36:09.107 --> 36:14.602
So if you decide to stay,
let's start with a clean slate.

36:16.114 --> 36:17.638
I'd like that.

36:18.317 --> 36:21.753
As long as I don't have to
knuckle-bump with Daniel anymore.

36:25.357 --> 36:29.259
- We still have to try that Scotch.
- It's a date.

36:37.402 --> 36:40.303
Will you excuse me? It's my fiancÃ©e.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.515
- So, can I call you?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm in the book.

36:57.557 --> 36:59.354
Hunter Farthington.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.864
- Marc!
- Cliff! What are you doing here?

37:08.903 --> 37:10.632
I got your 20 messages.

37:12.540 --> 37:14.599
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

37:14.975 --> 37:18.433
I should have known that asking you
to move in would cause a meltdown.

37:18.512 --> 37:22.278
You're a neurotic mess,
and I love that about you.

37:28.022 --> 37:29.114
Hey.

37:29.958 --> 37:34.418
Look, all that matters
is that we love each other.

37:41.803 --> 37:44.931
- Marry me!
- What?

37:46.041 --> 37:49.636
Marry me, Cliff.
I want to be with you forever.

38:06.996 --> 38:09.157
I blew it up there with Connor.

38:09.198 --> 38:11.962
I can't believe what a fool I made
out of myself.

38:12.001 --> 38:15.562
No, I'm pretty sure I'm a bigger fool.

38:15.605 --> 38:17.630
I threw him a party...

38:19.276 --> 38:20.834
Are you crying?

38:23.547 --> 38:26.311
I was so stupid to think
that he would like me!

38:26.383 --> 38:28.510
Of course he likes Amanda.

38:29.086 --> 38:30.144
Amanda?

38:30.220 --> 38:32.347
They were kissing. I walked in on them.

38:33.924 --> 38:35.949
I should've known
that when he said I was beautiful,

38:35.993 --> 38:37.984
he meant on the inside.

38:38.629 --> 38:41.962
- You are.
- You don't have to say that, Daniel.

38:43.468 --> 38:47.461
I'm fine with who I am.
But I'm not beautiful.

38:47.505 --> 38:52.204
Betty, men are stupid.
They go for the obvious.

38:52.844 --> 38:57.304
Trust me, I know. I'm still doing it
and I should know better.

38:59.250 --> 39:04.620
But you're 24. It's okay to have a crush,
act a little stupid.

39:06.191 --> 39:09.422
But you have to believe me
when I say this.

39:09.461 --> 39:11.588
You are beautiful.

39:35.488 --> 39:36.682
Hey.

39:39.459 --> 39:44.396
So, I made like a ton of money tonight.

39:45.031 --> 39:48.728
And I'm a simple girl.
What do I need it for?

39:49.369 --> 39:52.463
Here. You should put it toward rent.

40:02.917 --> 40:05.545
Hey, so, remember that guy
that I was kissing earlier?

40:05.619 --> 40:09.578
Yeah, I don't think you know him.
Anyway, I am so over him.

40:09.657 --> 40:13.218
I was talking to him,
and it turns out he's kind of stupid.

40:13.260 --> 40:17.287
I mean, yes, he's the kind of guy
a girl would totally fall for.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.493
But he is so not worth it.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.871
Betty, I had no idea.

40:28.577 --> 40:31.740
Amanda, look, I was wrong.

40:31.780 --> 40:34.340
You aren't the worst roommate ever.

40:34.883 --> 40:39.115
And if you need to stay here
for a little while longer,

40:41.590 --> 40:43.388
I'm fine with that.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.395
You know, Betty, you're lucky.

40:51.968 --> 40:55.131
When someone falls in love with you,
it's real.

40:55.705 --> 40:57.536
I've never had that.

40:58.541 --> 41:03.171
I never know if I'm loved for who I am
or because I'm so pretty.

41:10.187 --> 41:12.917
Why don't you finish
cleaning up in here?

41:36.881 --> 41:38.576
Betty.

41:42.387 --> 41:43.945
Have a seat.

41:46.224 --> 41:48.249
<i>Details of your look</i>

41:49.227 --> 41:51.218
<i>Like your touch</i>

41:51.563 --> 41:53.622
<i>Killing me by shoot</i>

41:54.232 --> 41:56.599
<i>Just in once</i>

41:56.635 --> 42:01.572
<i>Oh, see, just take a look
with your cries</i>

42:02.108 --> 42:06.545
<i>Since the days of school
you and I</i>

42:07.179 --> 42:10.148
<i>You are my way</i>

42:12.751 --> 42:15.413
<i>Just let me play</i>

42:16.305 --> 42:22.498
