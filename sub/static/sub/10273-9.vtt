Previously on "The Americans..."

00:03.201 --> 00:05.978
<i>If we start killing scientists</i>
<i>"on U.S. soil,</i>

00:06.103 --> 00:07.437
who knows where it leads?

00:07.504 --> 00:10.007
At best,
the secret war escalates.

00:10.506 --> 00:11.762
At worst...

00:14.011 --> 00:15.545
He got one of the scientists.

00:15.613 --> 00:16.847
God damn it.

00:16.914 --> 00:19.116
This is our worst failure
in 15 years.

00:19.183 --> 00:20.918
I swear to God, they'll pay.

00:20.986 --> 00:22.119
This will not stand.

00:22.187 --> 00:24.021
I've been so stressed lately.

00:24.089 --> 00:26.891
You know I could get anything
that Agent Gaad has.

00:26.959 --> 00:28.793
Oh! What?

00:28.861 --> 00:30.361
You just... you startled me.

00:30.429 --> 00:33.230
Did something happen
between you and Irina?

00:33.298 --> 00:35.800
Nothing happened.
There's only you.

00:35.868 --> 00:37.735
I asked you not to lie to me.

00:37.803 --> 00:40.205
I made a terrible mistake.

00:40.273 --> 00:44.804
Can we please just...
Try and start over?

00:44.929 --> 00:46.712
No. We can't.

00:49.182 --> 00:50.950
Can I have
another piece of fried chicken?

00:51.017 --> 00:51.951
Of course.

00:52.019 --> 00:52.918
Me too.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.186
Uh, white or dark meat?

00:54.254 --> 00:55.621
- White.
- Dark.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.191
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:00.126 --> 01:01.560
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.796
I wish we could
have fried chicken every week.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.531
Twice a week. Every day.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.373
Your dad and I, um...

01:12.441 --> 01:15.343
Want to talk to you guys
about something.

01:17.146 --> 01:18.947
Oh, my God.

01:19.015 --> 01:20.382
You're too old.

01:20.449 --> 01:22.384
I'm too old for what?

01:22.452 --> 01:23.752
To have a baby.

01:23.820 --> 01:26.789
Jen's mom is ancient,
and she's pregnant,

01:26.856 --> 01:28.790
and she's
light years younger than you.

01:28.858 --> 01:30.892
- You're having a baby?
- No.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.627
No. Where did you
get that idea?

01:32.695 --> 01:34.796
- You just said...
- No, no.

01:37.333 --> 01:40.268
Dad is going to be

01:40.336 --> 01:42.237
staying somewhere else
for a little while.

01:44.307 --> 01:45.640
Are you going
on a business trip?

01:45.708 --> 01:47.776
No.

01:47.844 --> 01:49.378
You're separating?

01:50.914 --> 01:52.414
Well, no, we're not...

01:52.482 --> 01:54.583
we're not separating,
not exactly.

01:54.651 --> 01:57.019
We're... it's a little bit
more like, uh...

01:57.087 --> 01:58.588
hitting the pause button.

02:00.524 --> 02:01.925
For how long?

02:01.992 --> 02:03.593
I don't know. We don't know.

02:05.263 --> 02:07.264
You're kidding, right?

02:07.331 --> 02:10.000
I mean, this is a joke,
isn't it?

02:13.103 --> 02:15.305
Why?

02:15.372 --> 02:18.842
Your dad and I have...

02:18.909 --> 02:20.843
you know,
we've been fighting a lot.

02:20.911 --> 02:22.011
You always fight a lot.

02:22.079 --> 02:23.045
- Too much.
- We know.

02:23.113 --> 02:24.013
Then stop.

02:24.081 --> 02:25.782
- We can't.
- Tried.

02:25.849 --> 02:27.884
When Henry and I fight,
you tell us to stop.

02:27.951 --> 02:29.418
If we can, why can't you?

02:31.088 --> 02:32.288
I don't know.

02:33.624 --> 02:36.459
The important thing is...

02:36.527 --> 02:40.897
Other than the fact that
we love you so very much,

02:40.964 --> 02:43.833
is that dad and I
need some time

02:43.901 --> 02:45.968
to figure things out.

02:46.036 --> 02:49.038
Do you guys not
love each other anymore?

02:50.407 --> 02:52.175
It's... it's complicated.

02:52.243 --> 02:54.010
And when you're grown up,

02:54.078 --> 02:55.345
you'll understand.

02:55.412 --> 02:57.046
- Bullshit!
- Paige...

02:57.114 --> 02:59.649
You don't just
stop loving someone!

03:01.252 --> 03:03.253
Are you gonna stop loving us?

03:03.320 --> 03:06.189
No. That is...
I mean, it's impossible.

03:06.257 --> 03:07.991
That would never happen. Never.

03:08.058 --> 03:11.327
This is so stupid.

03:11.395 --> 03:13.863
This is your fault! You're
always giving dad a rough time!

03:13.931 --> 03:14.897
It's not mom's fault.

03:14.965 --> 03:16.766
Why are you defending her?

03:16.834 --> 03:18.401
I'm not. Look, this is...

03:18.469 --> 03:20.002
Our decision.

03:20.070 --> 03:22.238
We... we both
made this decision.

03:39.023 --> 03:42.859
Henry, please open up.
I just want to talk.

03:59.811 --> 04:02.813
I love you so much.

04:04.482 --> 04:06.483
More than you'll ever know.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.608
So, I'll see you tomorrow
at the Beemans'?

04:31.676 --> 04:35.145
Are we really gonna
go to a party together?

04:35.212 --> 04:37.414
If Stan's work friends
are gonna be there,

04:37.481 --> 04:38.982
I think we should be, too.

04:39.050 --> 04:41.251
Mm.

05:34.511 --> 05:37.180
I got fresh meat, fresh meat.

05:37.247 --> 05:39.315
- You want a dog?
- Yeah, I'll... I'll have one.

05:39.383 --> 05:40.717
Paige, do you want a hamburger?

05:40.784 --> 05:42.251
No.

05:44.021 --> 05:46.189
Rough night?

05:46.256 --> 05:49.525
No one is doing
particularly well right now.

05:49.593 --> 05:52.028
Paige slept in Henry's room.

05:52.095 --> 05:53.563
How is Henry?

05:53.630 --> 05:56.232
Not great.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.834
Where are you staying?

05:57.902 --> 06:00.737
Motel in Peterborough.

06:00.804 --> 06:02.405
That sounds depressing.

06:02.472 --> 06:05.408
It's okay for now.

06:05.476 --> 06:07.743
It's for the best.

06:09.914 --> 06:11.714
Yeah, I know.

06:14.285 --> 06:16.953
I suppose we should mingle.

06:18.389 --> 06:20.256
<i>Watching game 7</i>
<i>of the eastern quarterfinals</i>

06:20.324 --> 06:21.257
<i>here in Philadelphia.</i>

06:21.325 --> 06:22.592
Hey, how you guys doing?

06:22.660 --> 06:24.494
We're doing great.
That's a big old...

06:24.562 --> 06:25.862
that's a big, old
plate of meat you got.

06:25.930 --> 06:27.831
Yeah. Sit. Rest your dogs.

06:27.898 --> 06:29.566
Oh! Funny man!

06:29.634 --> 06:31.401
All right.

06:31.469 --> 06:33.003
So, we're gonna do something.

06:35.172 --> 06:38.575
We're gonna take one of them out
right here in D.C.

06:38.643 --> 06:41.511
<i>They're on the boards...</i>

06:41.579 --> 06:43.580
Is this approved?

06:43.648 --> 06:46.116
If anyone should ask, no.

06:46.184 --> 06:48.118
Who's the target?

06:48.186 --> 06:50.420
The acting KGB Rezident.

06:50.488 --> 06:51.955
Arkady?

06:52.022 --> 06:53.456
That's a big target.

06:53.524 --> 06:56.426
They just killed
three of our own.

06:56.494 --> 06:57.961
If we don't hit them
hard and fast,

06:58.029 --> 06:59.829
those won't be
our last casualties.

07:01.332 --> 07:02.966
How's it going down?

07:03.034 --> 07:05.969
Arkady likes to jog
Monday and Wednesday afternoon.

07:06.037 --> 07:07.804
He's back in his office
at 5:00.

07:07.872 --> 07:10.374
When? Tomorrow.

07:10.441 --> 07:12.376
And, uh,
this is not an assignment.

07:12.443 --> 07:15.412
Participation
is strictly voluntary.

07:15.479 --> 07:16.246
I'm in.

07:16.314 --> 07:18.715
Me too.

07:20.485 --> 07:23.787
I'm sorry,
if this is extrajudicial...

07:23.854 --> 07:26.022
I would rather stay away.

07:27.524 --> 07:29.892
Okay.

07:32.796 --> 07:34.330
Hey.

07:34.398 --> 07:35.798
Hey.

07:35.866 --> 07:37.333
What's up with your brother?

07:37.401 --> 07:39.469
He looks like
he lost his best friend.

07:39.537 --> 07:42.272
He did.

07:42.339 --> 07:46.509
My parents are taking
a vacation from each other.

07:48.645 --> 07:50.313
My dad moved out last night.

07:50.381 --> 07:52.014
For good?

07:52.082 --> 07:53.482
Who knows?

07:53.550 --> 07:55.651
They say they're
hitting the pause button,

07:55.719 --> 07:58.520
whatever that means.

07:58.588 --> 08:00.488
Okay. All right.

08:00.556 --> 08:02.724
Sorry.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.962
Only one way
to stop a bully, Stan.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.464
I can't go in on this,
Chris. I can't.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.266
Your shoes squeak. I get it.

08:12.334 --> 08:14.635
Me? My shoes...
they don't squeak.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.237
I'm fully lubricated.

08:18.007 --> 08:20.141
Who's, um...

08:20.209 --> 08:21.609
Who's the babe?

08:21.677 --> 08:23.311
Not your wife... the other fox?

08:23.378 --> 08:25.179
That's my neighbor.

08:25.247 --> 08:27.514
That's your neighbor? Mm-hmm.

08:27.582 --> 08:29.716
I'd borrow some sugar
if I was you.

08:29.784 --> 08:31.185
You're a putz.

08:34.121 --> 08:35.889
You know, I was sitting
by the window the other night,

08:35.957 --> 08:38.592
and I was reading,
and I saw Philip leave.

08:39.861 --> 08:41.361
I mean, I wasn't spying.

08:41.429 --> 08:43.030
No, no. Of course not.

08:43.097 --> 08:45.133
Is everything
okay with you guys?

08:45.200 --> 08:49.404
We are taking some time apart.

08:49.471 --> 08:51.171
But I guess
that's not something

08:51.239 --> 08:52.640
you can keep quiet
for very long.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.709
No. Um, why would you want to?

08:54.777 --> 08:56.677
Privacy, I guess.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.880
There's no shame in it.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.983
Do the kids know yet?

09:02.051 --> 09:04.752
- We told them last night.
- Oh.

09:06.121 --> 09:07.422
Well, you know,
if you need anything,

09:07.489 --> 09:09.491
you don't hesitate
to ask me, okay?

09:11.327 --> 09:13.862
Thanks. Yeah.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.365
Dad, I want you to come home.

09:16.433 --> 09:17.733
We both do.

09:17.801 --> 09:20.035
I-I can't.

09:20.103 --> 09:22.504
Why not? I...

09:22.572 --> 09:24.841
I just can't, sweetheart.
Please?

09:24.908 --> 09:27.043
I'm sorry.

09:27.111 --> 09:29.745
See you soon.

09:40.991 --> 09:43.626
Ooh, shoot yourself
into me, Clark!

09:46.430 --> 09:48.731
Oh! Take me!

09:48.799 --> 09:51.668
Oh, God, take me!

09:54.671 --> 09:59.709
I have to go. There's
a situation with the department.

09:59.777 --> 10:02.212
What's going on?

10:02.280 --> 10:05.782
Three Agents got killed
and a scientist.

10:05.850 --> 10:07.650
I know. Everyone's upset.

10:07.718 --> 10:10.587
Yeah.

10:10.655 --> 10:14.392
Clark...

10:14.459 --> 10:15.960
I'm in love with you.

10:17.663 --> 10:21.300
I waited my whole life for you,

10:21.368 --> 10:26.506
and I would do
anything for you.

10:26.574 --> 10:28.341
Anything.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.778
All you have to do is ask.

10:31.845 --> 10:33.747
Just please...

10:33.814 --> 10:36.082
Just tell me one thing?

10:40.187 --> 10:42.221
Is this real?

10:44.324 --> 10:45.991
Yes.

10:49.829 --> 10:51.497
Yes.

10:55.535 --> 10:58.037
Well, then, stay with me.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.876
Please.

11:02.943 --> 11:04.911
Just this once.

11:21.362 --> 11:23.329
Where's Henry?

11:23.397 --> 11:25.031
How should I know?

11:25.099 --> 11:27.233
Henry!

11:30.871 --> 11:32.805
What should I tell my friends?

11:32.873 --> 11:35.408
Why do you have to
tell your friends anything?

11:35.476 --> 11:37.176
If they ask.

11:37.244 --> 11:39.846
Tell them whatever you want.

11:39.913 --> 11:41.180
Tell them the truth.

11:41.248 --> 11:43.149
Which is what?

11:44.585 --> 11:47.854
That your parents aren't
living together right now.

11:47.921 --> 11:50.322
Henry, get down here right now!

11:50.390 --> 11:52.958
We're gonna be late!

12:00.801 --> 12:02.636
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

12:06.741 --> 12:07.741
Oh, wow.

12:07.809 --> 12:09.343
Hi. Hi.

12:09.410 --> 12:10.911
It's been a long time

12:10.978 --> 12:12.979
since I've had a man sleep in my bed.

12:14.515 --> 12:16.482
I think I can get used to this.

12:19.119 --> 12:20.352
But I got to go to work.

12:20.420 --> 12:23.255
What's the rush?

12:23.323 --> 12:25.424
Well, there's a lot going on.

12:25.492 --> 12:28.694
Agent Gaad got a call
from the white house

12:28.762 --> 12:31.363
a couple days ago,
and since then,

12:31.431 --> 12:33.065
he's been in and out,
having secret meetings

12:33.133 --> 12:35.101
with his old buddies
from the C.I.A.

12:35.168 --> 12:37.903
He thinks that
I don't know, but...

12:37.971 --> 12:40.273
I'm his secretary,
not his potted plant.

12:40.340 --> 12:43.075
What are they planning?

12:43.143 --> 12:46.946
Well, I think they're gonna
kill a KGB Agent.

12:48.382 --> 12:50.617
It's an eye for an eye, Clark.

12:50.684 --> 12:52.485
But you

12:52.553 --> 12:54.988
Can stay as long as you like.

12:58.191 --> 13:00.292
Mm. Bye.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.461
Bye.

13:37.896 --> 13:39.530
Can I help you?

13:39.597 --> 13:42.766
I don't know.

13:42.834 --> 13:45.635
I'm with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

13:45.703 --> 13:47.270
Can I ask you a few questions?

13:47.338 --> 13:48.872
About what?

13:48.939 --> 13:51.507
Why don't we start
with who you are?

13:51.575 --> 13:54.978
W-who I... I'm...
I'm just a guy.

13:55.046 --> 13:56.346
Yeah, you're just a guy

13:56.414 --> 13:59.115
who spent the night
with a girl... Martha.

14:01.452 --> 14:03.119
Oh, look, my friend, I don't...

14:03.187 --> 14:04.554
I'm not your friend, friend.

14:06.591 --> 14:08.425
What are you doing here?

14:10.461 --> 14:11.995
You know what?
You got me dead to rights,

14:12.063 --> 14:13.496
'cause me and Martha...

14:13.564 --> 14:15.232
we've been banging each other
into ecstatic oblivion

14:15.299 --> 14:17.067
for the past... wow...
10 hours.

14:17.134 --> 14:18.968
Look, why don't we take
this conversation downtown?

14:21.305 --> 14:23.406
Lock up your car.

14:23.474 --> 14:25.574
Okay.

14:57.140 --> 14:59.408
Holy shit.

15:08.451 --> 15:10.185
No, no.

15:10.253 --> 15:13.188
No. No!

15:13.256 --> 15:14.723
Aah!

15:37.891 --> 15:39.192
What happened?

15:39.260 --> 15:40.860
He followed me
coming out of Martha's.

15:40.928 --> 15:42.596
I need to go back
and move his car.

15:42.663 --> 15:44.631
I've seen him before. Yeah.

15:44.699 --> 15:46.366
At the Beeman party.

15:46.434 --> 15:49.370
He's FBI.

15:49.438 --> 15:51.839
Does he know
you're working Martha?

15:51.907 --> 15:53.274
I don't know. I suppose.

15:53.342 --> 15:54.975
Uh, or this just could be a...

15:55.043 --> 15:56.944
what? What?

15:57.012 --> 15:59.179
A total screw-up.

15:59.247 --> 16:00.848
He might have been
seeing Martha himself.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.650
A jealous suitor?

16:02.718 --> 16:04.685
But I got something
from Martha.

16:04.753 --> 16:06.554
The FBI
are planning retaliation.

16:06.621 --> 16:08.622
They're gonna kill a KGB Agent
here in D.C.

16:08.690 --> 16:12.326
- He'll know what they're planning.
- Yeah.

16:12.394 --> 16:13.694
I brought morphine.

16:13.762 --> 16:14.895
He needs to be in a hospital.

16:14.963 --> 16:16.664
We'll do what we can.

16:19.535 --> 16:20.868
The wound's pretty deep.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.736
We're gonna have to
pack it or cauterize it

16:22.804 --> 16:24.271
once we take the knife out.

16:52.435 --> 16:54.503
You seen Amador?

16:54.570 --> 16:56.170
No. He was supposed to meet me
an hour ago.

16:56.238 --> 16:57.872
He never showed.

16:57.940 --> 16:59.440
It's not like him.

17:13.021 --> 17:14.589
<i>You've reached Amador.</i>

17:14.656 --> 17:16.090
<i>If I'm not working,</i>
<i>I'm out having a ball.</i>

17:16.157 --> 17:17.726
<i>Leave it at the beep.</i>

17:17.792 --> 17:19.027
Hey, it's Stan.

17:19.095 --> 17:20.529
Where the hell are you?

17:20.596 --> 17:22.430
Call me.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.403
What'd you do with his car?

17:28.471 --> 17:29.971
I wiped it down for prints

17:30.039 --> 17:31.973
and parked it around the corner
from his apartment.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.141
All right.

17:34.209 --> 17:36.076
Now, when I pull this,

17:36.144 --> 17:38.879
it's gonna gush
like a broken pipe.

17:41.349 --> 17:43.617
Ready? Yeah.

17:54.730 --> 17:56.264
Okay, lift him.

17:56.331 --> 17:58.166
Oh!

18:02.705 --> 18:05.506
Okay. Put him down.

18:10.179 --> 18:13.181
It's all right. It's over.
The hard part's over.

18:34.236 --> 18:36.537
Thank you.

18:40.375 --> 18:42.343
Chris?

18:42.410 --> 18:44.912
Chris!

18:58.125 --> 19:00.026
<i>You've reached Amador.</i>

19:00.094 --> 19:01.661
<i>If I'm not working,</i>
<i>I'm out having a ball.</i>

19:01.729 --> 19:04.064
<i>Leave it at the beep.</i>

19:04.131 --> 19:05.665
<i>Hey, it's Cheryl.</i>

19:05.733 --> 19:07.400
<i>We met at the crab shack.</i>

19:07.468 --> 19:09.469
<i>I thought we could</i>
<i>get together again.</i>

19:09.536 --> 19:11.171
<i>You have my number, right?</i>

19:13.708 --> 19:15.976
<i>Hello, Amador. This is Julie.</i>

19:16.044 --> 19:17.644
<i>I'm in town for a few days</i>

19:17.712 --> 19:20.247
<i>and wanted to see</i>
<i>if we could catch up.</i>

19:20.314 --> 19:22.148
<i>Call me, cutie.</i>

19:25.553 --> 19:29.389
<i>Chris, aunt Lyla's</i>
<i>coming for dinner tomorrow.</i>

19:29.457 --> 19:33.026
<i>I told her you're busy,</i>
<i>but you know what she's like.</i>

19:33.094 --> 19:36.429
<i>You and papa can</i>
<i>watch the game on TV, okay?</i>

19:36.497 --> 19:38.731
<i>So, you'll come?</i>

19:38.799 --> 19:40.600
<i>Good?</i>

19:40.668 --> 19:41.768
<i>Come.</i>

19:43.270 --> 19:44.504
<i>Hey, it's Stan.</i>

19:44.572 --> 19:46.172
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

20:10.965 --> 20:14.033
There's just no way that Amador would check
out like this, without touching base.

20:14.101 --> 20:16.269
He didn't answer his phone.
He didn't show up this morning.

20:16.337 --> 20:18.404
I went to his apartment.
He hasn't been home all morning.

20:18.472 --> 20:20.306
His car was around the corner
from his apartment.

20:20.374 --> 20:21.875
- I had forensics check it out.
- And?

20:21.942 --> 20:23.610
No prints.

20:23.678 --> 20:24.944
None.

20:25.012 --> 20:26.579
What? He wiped his own prints
off his car?

20:26.647 --> 20:27.780
We don't know that
the KGB has him.

20:27.848 --> 20:29.248
I know it. Look, I've got

20:29.316 --> 20:31.450
every available Agent
out looking for him.

20:31.518 --> 20:32.818
If he spent the night
out on the town

20:32.886 --> 20:34.253
and woke up
in the wrong room...

20:34.321 --> 20:35.788
I'm telling you,
that's not what's happening.

20:35.856 --> 20:37.823
Or if the KGB does have him,

20:37.891 --> 20:39.224
we'll find him.

20:40.861 --> 20:43.229
Let's not jump to conclusions.

20:43.297 --> 20:45.532
Let's just do our job.

20:48.669 --> 20:50.903
I have to get back. The kids
are gonna be home from school.

20:50.971 --> 20:52.505
Yeah, go, go. I'll, uh...

20:52.573 --> 20:54.241
I'll give him some more morphine
when he wakes.

20:54.308 --> 20:56.777
There's nothing else
we can do now.

20:56.844 --> 20:58.579
Okay.

21:27.873 --> 21:30.142
A counterintelligence artiste?

21:30.209 --> 21:31.844
Yeah, I'm like Picasso...

21:31.911 --> 21:34.147
Only with a gun
and not a brush.

21:34.214 --> 21:37.717
My work is my life,
and my life is my art.

21:37.785 --> 21:41.822
I have no wife, no kids,
no pets, no hobbies,

21:41.890 --> 21:43.824
no distractions...

21:43.892 --> 21:46.193
except for pussy.

21:46.261 --> 21:48.295
I got no attachments.

21:48.363 --> 21:53.167
I'm as unencumbered
as bedbugs in a flophouse,

21:53.235 --> 21:54.835
and I like it.

21:54.903 --> 21:56.637
It works for me.

21:56.705 --> 21:58.072
El Lobo.

21:58.140 --> 22:02.142
Sí. Yo soy El Lobo.

22:02.210 --> 22:06.146
Yeah. I am a lone wolf.

22:06.214 --> 22:07.848
That's good, Stan.

22:39.281 --> 22:42.277
Anybody home?

22:42.345 --> 22:45.914
Could use some help.

22:45.981 --> 22:47.616
Hey.

22:47.684 --> 22:50.519
I got Mac and cheese and
those pretzels that you love,

22:50.586 --> 22:53.188
the ones that are
as hard as rock candy.

22:53.256 --> 22:55.457
And I bought a wok.

22:55.525 --> 22:57.559
What for?

22:57.627 --> 22:59.695
To make Chinese food.

22:59.762 --> 23:01.730
You've never made Chinese food.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.467
First time for everything.

23:04.534 --> 23:06.335
Is that what this is about?

23:08.038 --> 23:09.973
You and dad split,
and you start...

23:10.041 --> 23:12.109
Cooking Chinese food?

23:12.176 --> 23:15.980
So we'll have
spaghetti and meat sauce, then.

23:16.047 --> 23:17.948
I don't care what we eat,

23:18.016 --> 23:20.151
and I don't want to pretend
that your life is a do-over,

23:20.218 --> 23:21.886
because mine isn't.

23:21.954 --> 23:25.289
So that's what you don't want.
What <i>do</i> you want?

23:29.895 --> 23:33.897
I want things to be
the way they were.

23:38.203 --> 23:40.070
I know.

23:40.138 --> 23:45.842
Paige, I know
things are hard right now.

23:45.910 --> 23:47.911
But it's for the best.

23:47.979 --> 23:49.780
For who?

23:58.156 --> 24:00.090
Hello, Mrs. Jennings.

24:00.157 --> 24:01.658
This is Mrs. Costa,
Henry's teacher.

24:01.726 --> 24:02.993
Mrs. Costa? No.

24:03.060 --> 24:05.295
Is this a bad time?
Uh... This is...

24:05.363 --> 24:07.831
no, this is not a bad time.

24:17.209 --> 24:19.477
Henry, you okay?

24:19.545 --> 24:21.846
Yeah.

24:21.914 --> 24:23.681
Tired?

24:35.895 --> 24:38.597
I just got a call
from Mrs. Costa.

24:40.133 --> 24:42.701
You have something
you want to tell me?

24:42.769 --> 24:44.102
No.

24:45.438 --> 24:47.372
Henry...

24:47.440 --> 24:51.310
I know this is...

24:51.377 --> 24:53.912
A terrible thing
to do to you right now.

24:55.748 --> 24:59.585
My parents... wouldn't have
even considered it.

24:59.653 --> 25:03.423
It would have been unthinkable.

25:03.490 --> 25:08.095
But times have changed,
and your dad and I...

25:18.107 --> 25:19.374
Mrs. Costa said

25:19.441 --> 25:21.576
you didn't do
your social-studies project.

25:21.644 --> 25:23.078
I did.

25:23.145 --> 25:25.680
Are you saying
she's not telling the truth?

25:30.953 --> 25:33.921
Show it to me, please.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.715
Is this it?

25:58.783 --> 26:00.951
Yeah.

26:01.019 --> 26:04.120
But you only wrote
one sentence.

26:07.058 --> 26:08.959
I didn't have
anything else to say.

26:32.850 --> 26:36.186
The KGB wants to know
what your next move is.

26:36.254 --> 26:37.921
They don't think you're
just going to sit back

26:37.989 --> 26:42.359
after losing your scientist
and three of your Agents.

26:46.097 --> 26:47.498
Has something happened?

26:47.566 --> 26:49.533
Who put the finger on Amador?

26:49.601 --> 26:52.102
Who?

26:52.170 --> 26:53.637
My partner.

26:53.705 --> 26:55.305
I don't know
what you're talking about.

26:55.373 --> 26:56.773
Don't lie to me, Nina.

26:56.841 --> 26:58.342
- Do not lie to me.
- You're hurting me!

26:58.409 --> 27:00.611
- Do not lie to me.
- I don't know! I swear! Let go.

27:00.678 --> 27:03.680
I don't know.
I swear I don't know.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.215
You find out who took Amador.

27:05.283 --> 27:08.685
You find out where he is.

27:08.753 --> 27:09.753
Now.

27:40.086 --> 27:41.920
Water.

28:03.311 --> 28:04.979
More?

28:10.085 --> 28:12.453
Cold.

28:31.038 --> 28:32.906
What do you want?

28:32.974 --> 28:36.376
Information.

28:36.444 --> 28:40.480
Who are the FBI
planning to take out?

28:43.051 --> 28:45.219
I don't know.

28:49.057 --> 28:51.492
I think you do.

28:58.566 --> 29:01.802
Several of my friends
from the C.I.A.

29:01.870 --> 29:04.238
Will be working with us
on this.

29:04.305 --> 29:06.573
This is Ms. Kendall.

29:11.546 --> 29:14.281
Arkady will be leaving
the Rezidentura in one hour.

29:14.349 --> 29:16.650
In approximately
1 hour and 14 minutes,

29:16.718 --> 29:18.819
Arkady will be
running his usual path

29:18.887 --> 29:20.187
through Danbury Park.

29:20.255 --> 29:22.423
Agent Samuels
will be sitting on a bench

29:22.491 --> 29:23.858
30 meters up the path

29:23.925 --> 29:26.360
from your post
at the interception point.

29:26.428 --> 29:29.831
If he raises his newspaper,
that will be your signal

29:29.898 --> 29:31.499
that the target
is in the field.

29:31.567 --> 29:34.836
But if Agent Samuels
drops his paper at any point,

29:34.903 --> 29:36.604
we will abort the mission.

29:36.672 --> 29:38.873
Because of
the high value of the target,

29:38.941 --> 29:40.608
any decision to take action

29:40.676 --> 29:43.645
will be verified by us
through the signal.

29:43.712 --> 29:45.947
Any questions?

29:55.891 --> 29:58.993
Stan...

29:59.061 --> 30:01.462
I'm glad you're with us.

30:01.530 --> 30:03.864
Any word on Amador?

30:03.932 --> 30:05.866
We're still working on it.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.202
If we'd hit the KGB earlier,
they wouldn't have him.

30:08.269 --> 30:09.937
Maybe. Who knows?

30:11.572 --> 30:15.476
Listen, if we kill Arkady,

30:15.543 --> 30:17.878
we're signing
Amador's death certificate.

30:17.946 --> 30:19.413
We have to take him alive.

30:19.481 --> 30:22.182
There's something else
we have to consider.

30:22.250 --> 30:25.385
Amador knows the name of
your mole in the Rezidentura.

30:25.453 --> 30:28.855
If the KGB has him
and he talks,

30:28.923 --> 30:31.224
she's finished.

30:34.929 --> 30:37.163
Henry's teacher called.

30:37.231 --> 30:38.664
Why?

30:38.732 --> 30:41.267
He was staring
out the window all day,

30:41.335 --> 30:44.670
was not participating,
not talking in class.

30:46.673 --> 30:48.841
How's Paige? She hates my guts

30:48.909 --> 30:51.745
and isn't shy about
letting it be known.

30:51.812 --> 30:54.414
I'm sorry.

30:54.482 --> 30:56.283
How's Amador?

30:56.351 --> 30:57.717
He's weak, but he's awake.

30:57.785 --> 30:59.085
Says he doesn't know anything.

30:59.153 --> 31:01.188
He's lying. I know.

31:01.255 --> 31:02.889
They're gonna be looking for him
all over town.

31:02.957 --> 31:04.257
We have to get
the hell out of here.

31:04.325 --> 31:05.759
No. He's too weak to move.

31:05.826 --> 31:07.026
We can't wait for him
to come around.

31:07.094 --> 31:09.429
We need information,
and we need it now.

31:09.497 --> 31:12.265
It's my turn to try.

31:16.203 --> 31:19.138
Da.

31:44.230 --> 31:46.765
We've met before.

31:46.833 --> 31:48.667
I don't think so.

31:48.735 --> 31:50.503
I would have remembered.

31:51.872 --> 31:54.640
In a bar.

31:54.707 --> 31:56.775
We both had too much to drink.

31:56.843 --> 31:58.644
And we screwed our brains out.

32:01.348 --> 32:03.615
You couldn't get enough of me.

32:03.683 --> 32:05.117
And you?

32:05.185 --> 32:07.886
I came and went.

32:13.260 --> 32:16.996
I don't know anything
about a hit.

32:17.064 --> 32:20.699
If I did, I'd tell you, baby.

32:20.767 --> 32:22.267
Scout's honor.

32:22.335 --> 32:25.839
We both know that's not true.

32:29.944 --> 32:32.345
You're gonna lose this war.

32:34.115 --> 32:37.117
You know that, right?

32:37.184 --> 32:41.154
You can torture me...

32:41.222 --> 32:43.924
And you can kill me...

32:46.627 --> 32:49.896
but we're gonna kick
your motherland's marbled ass,

32:49.964 --> 32:54.701
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

32:59.373 --> 33:01.975
He's en route.

33:04.546 --> 33:06.180
Okay. We're good to go.

33:06.247 --> 33:07.748
Stand by.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.694
Where's Arkady?

33:20.762 --> 33:22.829
Abort.

33:22.897 --> 33:24.731
Abort!

33:24.799 --> 33:25.865
Grab him.

33:25.933 --> 33:27.701
Our orders are to stand down.

33:27.768 --> 33:29.269
To hell with that.
Grab him now.

33:32.907 --> 33:34.574
What?!

33:36.243 --> 33:37.978
Just keep your mouth shut.
Move, move.

33:49.472 --> 33:50.839
God damn it, Beeman.

33:50.907 --> 33:52.241
What the hell
did you think you were doing?

33:52.309 --> 33:53.709
They got my partner.

33:53.777 --> 33:55.111
What would you have done?

34:00.176 --> 34:02.989
Go on.
We'll get into this later.

34:10.094 --> 34:12.262
Uncuff him.

34:16.802 --> 34:19.003
And his mouth.

34:30.683 --> 34:34.253
Do you Hunt?

34:34.320 --> 34:36.088
I don't understand.

34:36.156 --> 34:38.524
Do you Hunt...

34:38.591 --> 34:43.195
you know, shoot.
Kill things... animals.

34:43.263 --> 34:45.330
No.

34:49.002 --> 34:52.871
When you shoot a bird...
duck or pheasant, say...

34:52.938 --> 34:54.940
your dog, your retriever,

34:55.007 --> 34:57.243
picks it up in its mouth...
its soft mouth.

34:57.311 --> 34:58.878
Soft mouth is key...

34:58.946 --> 35:02.548
otherwise, the dog sinks his
teeth into the bird's flesh.

35:02.616 --> 35:06.385
Anyway
your dog brings it to you

35:06.453 --> 35:09.488
and lays it at your feet.

35:09.556 --> 35:11.757
But sometimes,
when you shoot the bird,

35:11.825 --> 35:13.826
it's not dead.

35:13.894 --> 35:16.262
It's just wounded.

35:16.330 --> 35:17.930
Strange thing is,

35:17.998 --> 35:19.632
whether the bird
is dead or just wounded,

35:19.700 --> 35:23.403
once the dog
gets it in its mouth,

35:23.470 --> 35:24.804
the bird goes limp.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.940
Like a rag... doesn't move.

35:27.008 --> 35:29.443
It acts like it's dead.

35:29.510 --> 35:31.244
Doesn't struggle or scream.

35:31.312 --> 35:35.215
It just... Goes limp.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.019
Don't you think that's strange?

35:44.324 --> 35:47.693
You know what I think it is?

35:47.761 --> 35:50.329
Fear.

35:50.397 --> 35:52.632
The bird's scared
out of its goddamn mind.

35:52.700 --> 35:55.903
Who wouldn't be? I know <i>I</i> would.

35:58.707 --> 36:00.808
Then again,
maybe the bird is faking.

36:00.876 --> 36:02.510
You know what I'm saying?

36:03.979 --> 36:08.316
Maybe it wants you...
talking about the bird now...

36:08.384 --> 36:11.119
to think it's dead

36:11.187 --> 36:13.721
so when the dog
drops it out of its soft mouth

36:13.789 --> 36:15.823
at its master's feet,

36:15.891 --> 36:17.959
it can take off.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.032
It works sometimes.

36:24.099 --> 36:28.069
You wouldn't think it does,
but it does.

36:28.136 --> 36:30.371
Not a lot.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.240
Once in a blue moon.

36:33.308 --> 36:36.576
Please, I swear...

36:36.644 --> 36:39.712
I'm not KGB.

36:39.780 --> 36:42.015
I don't know anything.

36:42.082 --> 36:46.485
Please... I swear.

36:48.388 --> 36:51.190
You're scared. I know.

36:51.258 --> 36:53.325
I would be, too,

36:53.393 --> 36:56.529
because I've got you
in my soft mouth,

36:56.597 --> 36:59.832
and you're not dead... not yet.

36:59.900 --> 37:01.701
Maybe you think you can run

37:01.769 --> 37:04.037
when I drop you
at my master's feet.

37:04.104 --> 37:07.107
Maybe you can. Maybe you will.

37:07.174 --> 37:11.577
But the thing is,
you have my partner.

37:11.645 --> 37:13.847
If you don't
tell me where he is,

37:13.914 --> 37:16.783
you will never get dropped
at my master's feet.

37:16.850 --> 37:19.852
My bite will go hard,

37:19.920 --> 37:22.255
and you will know you are dead

37:22.323 --> 37:24.057
before
your heart stops beating.

37:24.125 --> 37:26.726
Please, please,

37:26.794 --> 37:30.129
I swear, I'm a diplomat.

37:30.197 --> 37:33.032
I don't know.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.601
Please.

37:35.669 --> 37:38.271
Please.

37:42.676 --> 37:44.244
I need morphine.

37:44.311 --> 37:45.645
You'll get morphine

37:45.713 --> 37:47.814
when you tell me
what I need to know.

37:53.321 --> 37:54.988
What time is it?

37:57.658 --> 37:59.293
It's after 5:00.

38:03.498 --> 38:04.932
Arkady.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.201
What?

38:09.804 --> 38:11.238
Arkady.

38:11.306 --> 38:12.973
The Rezident is the target.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.142
Too late.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.544
He's already dead.

38:26.989 --> 38:29.256
Soviet embassy. May I help you?

38:29.324 --> 38:32.760
I need to talk to
the head of cultural affairs.

38:32.827 --> 38:35.195
What is this in reference to?

38:35.263 --> 38:39.634
I have information
about Vladimir Kosygin.

38:39.701 --> 38:42.337
One minute, please.

38:44.907 --> 38:46.007
Hello?

38:46.075 --> 38:47.375
To whom am I speaking?

38:47.443 --> 38:49.377
I have him.

38:49.445 --> 38:51.546
Your man. Vlad.

38:55.718 --> 38:59.253
He's nobody.
He has nothing for you.

39:01.056 --> 39:03.124
Well, that's probably true.

39:03.192 --> 39:06.027
So, then, let him go.

39:06.094 --> 39:07.995
Well,
it doesn't work like that.

39:08.063 --> 39:10.131
Tell me, how does it work?

39:10.963 --> 39:14.269
Amador... release him.

39:16.094 --> 39:17.516
This man...

39:18.842 --> 39:20.041
I do not know.

39:20.376 --> 39:24.147
Listen to me.
Listen very carefully.

39:24.272 --> 39:25.297
I'm listening.

39:25.936 --> 39:29.851
If anything happens to amador,
vlad is dead.

39:30.903 --> 39:33.076
I will personally
send you his balls

39:33.201 --> 39:36.592
To wear around your neck
at your next may day parade.

39:50.502 --> 39:52.452
_

39:52.723 --> 39:54.130
_

39:54.737 --> 39:55.727
_

39:56.494 --> 39:59.259
_

40:00.592 --> 40:01.524
_

40:02.414 --> 40:03.860
_

40:05.977 --> 40:08.358
_

40:10.016 --> 40:11.214
_

40:11.339 --> 40:14.266
_

40:20.133 --> 40:21.002
Hello.

40:22.849 --> 40:23.600
Hello!

40:23.725 --> 40:25.390
- Arkady?
- Yes.

40:33.680 --> 40:35.438
Arkady is alive and well.

40:35.941 --> 40:38.269
- How do you know?
- I called the Rezidentura, I spoke to him.

40:38.435 --> 40:40.447
- So we need to contact Grannie.
- I did.

40:40.703 --> 40:42.045
She said there was a different target.

40:42.412 --> 40:44.275
Vladimir Kosygin,
a first-tour officer.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.975
Went out for a run,
never came back.

40:46.615 --> 40:48.292
What I don't understand is why.

40:48.645 --> 40:51.968
Why would amador lie
about Arkady being the target?

40:52.320 --> 40:54.062
He fingers
the head of directorate "s"

40:54.187 --> 40:55.702
To protect
a first-tour officer?

40:55.827 --> 40:57.641
It doesn't make any sense.
He's playing us.

40:58.392 --> 40:59.707
He's hiding something else.

41:02.818 --> 41:03.857
What are you gonna do?

41:04.815 --> 41:06.573
Whatever it takes to get him to talk.

41:07.628 --> 41:08.395
I'll do it.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.100
I'll <i>do</i> it.

41:13.124 --> 41:14.994
I didn't want this to happen,
but it happened.

41:15.968 --> 41:18.365
Things just got a little crazy,
you know?

41:18.829 --> 41:19.388
Yeah.

41:22.408 --> 41:24.133
I wouldn't let a dog suffer like this.

41:24.789 --> 41:25.555
Would you?

41:27.409 --> 41:28.209
No.

41:29.646 --> 41:30.892
After he talks

41:31.467 --> 41:32.586
give him the morphine.

41:33.113 --> 41:34.088
Just let him drift off.

41:38.002 --> 41:39.488
All right, Chris. No more time.

41:40.408 --> 41:43.012
We need to know what you're holding back,
and we need to know n...

41:54.378 --> 41:55.449
Goddamn it.

42:52.550 --> 42:54.691
I'm gonna pull every Agent.

42:55.874 --> 42:58.382
This will be the top priority.

42:59.564 --> 43:00.683
It's family.

43:03.974 --> 43:05.093
How did he die?

43:06.435 --> 43:09.215
Slowly... he was stabbed.

43:10.622 --> 43:12.507
He was dead before they
dumped him here.

43:14.841 --> 43:16.902
What's strange is, that whoever did it

43:18.164 --> 43:20.226
then took the trouble
to try and save him.

43:22.639 --> 43:23.885
It's probably to late

43:24.010 --> 43:26.479
to exfiltrate your girl
in the Rezidentura.

43:28.407 --> 43:29.766
Amador didn't give her up.

43:31.779 --> 43:34.237
Everybody talks, it's biology.

43:34.362 --> 43:35.614
He didn't give her up.

43:38.347 --> 43:39.721
Gonna risk her life on that?

43:42.070 --> 43:43.125
And mine.

44:14.995 --> 44:16.082
Vietnam

44:16.207 --> 44:17.951
turn you into a skirt chaser?

44:18.076 --> 44:20.172
I was straight as an arrow
when I signed up.

44:21.211 --> 44:22.840
Was an altar boy `til I was seventeen.

44:22.965 --> 44:23.911
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:24.036 --> 44:25.653
`Nam changed things.

44:26.739 --> 44:28.641
It was crazy shit over there.

44:30.142 --> 44:31.964
You never knew when your number
was gonna be called.

44:33.578 --> 44:34.457
I learned two things,

44:34.712 --> 44:38.036
One, Tempus Fugit...
"time flies."

44:38.425 --> 44:40.676
One way or the other,
you snatch it,

44:41.715 --> 44:42.961
or it's gonna snatch you.

44:44.239 --> 44:45.390
There's no pause button.

44:46.748 --> 44:47.727
And, two...

44:49.352 --> 44:50.838
there are worse things than dying.

44:52.404 --> 44:53.954
- Like?
- Shame.

44:58.060 --> 44:59.418
Shame is not an option for me.

45:02.759 --> 45:03.574
I don't understand

45:03.699 --> 45:06.662
How that has anything to do
with you chasing pussy.

45:06.787 --> 45:07.787
[ Laughs )

45:07.840 --> 45:10.620
Pussy is a thing,
and it's not a thing Stan.

45:11.435 --> 45:13.161
It's real and it's not.

45:13.960 --> 45:14.982
It's a metaphor.

45:15.830 --> 45:16.932
For what?

45:17.683 --> 45:19.121
The whole enchilada.

45:51.305 --> 45:53.334
- Thank you.
- Mhmm.

46:06.399 --> 46:07.765
What are you going to do?

46:08.172 --> 46:09.562
Eat.

46:24.362 --> 46:25.449
Enjoy.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.607
So you're KGB right?

46:43.771 --> 46:45.928
Come on we both know it's true,
I just wanna hear it.

46:50.930 --> 46:51.713
Yes.

46:53.918 --> 46:55.132
But I don't know anything.

46:58.967 --> 46:59.782
I believe you.

47:03.777 --> 47:04.752
That's good huh?

47:06.142 --> 47:08.379
Mm, nothing beats American fast food.

47:09.868 --> 47:12.550
It's probably filled with all kinds
of nasty shit that'll kill you, but man...

47:14.179 --> 47:16.241
it sure taste good.

47:18.686 --> 47:19.795
*** a drink?

47:21.913 --> 47:22.824
Yes please.

47:25.365 --> 47:26.886
Think I have a Cola here.
