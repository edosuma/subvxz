33:09.946 --> 33:11.448
<i>WILLIAM: Pervitin.</i>

33:12.866 --> 33:16.461
<i>The Germans</i> called
it <i>the "Wunderdroge."</i>

33:17.579 --> 33:20.423
Prescribed for
superhuman feats.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.852
<i>But beware of the side effects</i>

33:36.932 --> 33:38.775
which include sudden
bouts of blindness,

33:38.850 --> 33:40.693
diarrhea, heart palpitations

33:40.769 --> 33:44.114
and a severe decline
in moral standards.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.582
Unbloomed stalwart.

33:55.909 --> 33:56.910
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

33:56.993 --> 33:58.916
Come out and play.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.958
What the hell are you doing?

34:03.583 --> 34:05.085
Writing.

34:06.503 --> 34:08.005
WILLIAM: But the words...

34:10.257 --> 34:11.725
Oh, the words.

34:15.637 --> 34:16.638
Yeah.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.021
Lu, it's very rough.

34:24.478 --> 34:25.650
Oh.

34:26.313 --> 34:28.157
The vision at last.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.985
Can I see?

34:30.902 --> 34:31.949
Where's Lu?

34:32.070 --> 34:33.071
He's out.

34:34.656 --> 34:38.581
With a senior football player.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.205
A writer.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.255
And handsome, too.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.251
James?

34:46.668 --> 34:48.511
Jack. There it is.

34:48.837 --> 34:49.884
Jack.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.473
You're not allowed
to be here.

34:52.549 --> 34:53.675
(LAUGHS)

34:53.757 --> 34:56.226
That's odd since I'm the
only thing keeping him here.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.054
Not anymore.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.404
Piece of advice.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.450
You don't know Lu.

35:11.651 --> 35:14.450
As soon as you think you do,
he'll find someone else.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.620
Maybe he already has.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.707
What, are you moving in?

35:30.378 --> 35:32.301
Where have you been?

35:32.672 --> 35:34.470
I found a real writer.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.604
Already a million words under
his belt before Columbia.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.440
You mean Jack?

35:43.475 --> 35:44.897
Why didn't you tell me?

35:45.226 --> 35:47.274
What, am I
supposed to do newsreels?

35:50.565 --> 35:52.238
What's that?

35:54.444 --> 35:56.367
Oh, nothing.

35:59.366 --> 36:02.245
If you're going to stay,
don't hog the blanket.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.440
Why is Jack
a real writer?

36:27.227 --> 36:29.730
Once you meet him,
you'll see what I mean.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.323
JACK: Hey, Al.
No.

36:32.399 --> 36:33.867
Come on.
No.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.239
No.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.870
Oh! Fumble.

36:42.826 --> 36:43.998
EDIE: Jack, what was that?

36:44.119 --> 36:45.336
The damn cat.

36:47.789 --> 36:50.338
Shh! She painted it.
Say nothing.

36:54.796 --> 36:56.469
(JACK GRUNTING)

36:59.968 --> 37:01.891
JACK: Hey, when did this come?
EDIE: Today.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.723
It's from Sammy.
Where is he now?

37:04.806 --> 37:06.979
I don't know.
Some battleship.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.569
LUCIEN: What do you think?

37:09.644 --> 37:11.237
It's brilliant, no?

37:11.312 --> 37:13.280
It's missing some
periods and commas.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.575
It's better than
anything you've ever written.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.867
I use periods and commas.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.237
Both of you, quiet.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.744
<i>SAMMY". Kerouac.
How are you, chum?</i>

37:22.532 --> 37:24.079
Sammy, you bastard.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.331
Who's Sammy?

37:26.745 --> 37:29.089
My best friend since I was 12.
Off in the Navy.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.758
<i>We've just been through 20
days of German shelling</i>

37:31.833 --> 37:33.881
<i>every three hours,
night and day.</i>

37:34.711 --> 37:36.588
<i>This will be
my last one for a while.</i>

37:36.671 --> 37:41.768
<i>Tomorrow we're headed out to the
front, some beach near Rome. Anzio?</i>

37:41.843 --> 37:42.969
EDIE: Go sit at the table.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.305
<i>It's supposed to
be beautiful...</i>

37:53.521 --> 37:55.194
I didn't know
we were having guests.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.155
What's this?

37:58.359 --> 38:01.363
I was aiming for stew.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.328
Yeah? You missed.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.251
Come on, guys.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.579
Where are you going?
Out.

38:08.661 --> 38:11.631
Out? I have been
cooking all day for you.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.754
What? What do you want?
Want me to eat shoe leather?

38:13.833 --> 38:15.961
I'm hungry, and what you do
in the kitchen's unholy.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.762
That's funny.
You talk like a Catholic,

38:17.879 --> 38:19.597
but you fuck me
and won't marry me.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.299
How does that work?
Shut your mouth, Edie.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.350
I thought you
liked it wide open.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.608
Scram.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.402
Um...

38:36.981 --> 38:38.358
Allen.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.577
So, Al.
Thought my novel was shit?

38:44.906 --> 38:46.328
Not exactly. It's not
what I would choose...

38:46.407 --> 38:47.750
It's all true.

38:48.493 --> 38:50.495
Jack served in
the merchant marines.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.546
JACK: I left school
twice already.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.340
Columbia's full of squares.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.339
Not even sure why I
bothered to come back.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.505
Why don't you
just ship out again?

39:00.588 --> 39:04.013
Trust me, sometimes when I
fight with Edie, I want to.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.018
Well, you two did just fight.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.772
Carr, you're goddamn crazy.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.403
"A new vision." Yeah.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.863
Sounds phony.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.033
Movements are
cooked up by people

39:28.157 --> 39:30.660
who can't write
about the people who can.

39:30.743 --> 39:33.041
ALLEN: I don't think he gets
what we're trying to do.

39:33.121 --> 39:34.543
Listen to me.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.166
This whole town's
full of finks

39:36.249 --> 39:38.377
on the 30th floor
writing pure chintz.

39:39.669 --> 39:42.889
Writers. A real writer's
gotta be in the beds,

39:43.923 --> 39:46.597
down in the trenches
and all the broken places.

39:48.595 --> 39:49.972
Where were your trenches, Al?

39:50.388 --> 39:52.311
Allen.
Right.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.271
First thought, best thought.

39:54.350 --> 39:55.852
Fuck you.
What does that even mean?

39:55.935 --> 39:58.438
JACK: That's good.
That's one. What else?

39:58.813 --> 40:00.315
Fuck your one million words.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.983
Yes, even better.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.819
You don't know me.

40:04.319 --> 40:05.491
You're right.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.781
Who is "you"?

40:21.753 --> 40:23.255
"Be careful.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.723
"You are not in Wonderland.

40:27.800 --> 40:32.351

JACK: Al?

41:14.180 --> 41:16.023
That was beautiful, kid.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.237
You wrote that?

41:22.897 --> 41:24.490
You asked me to.

41:28.236 --> 41:29.613
Forget Columbia.

41:30.947 --> 41:33.075
Forget Ogden Nash.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.456
Here's the plan, boys.
We join the merchant marines,

41:36.536 --> 41:37.537
(JACK LAUGHS)

41:37.620 --> 41:39.668
sail the world
until the war ends,

41:39.747 --> 41:44.253
then jump ship and make it
to Paris for the liberation.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.346
And you don't speak French.

41:47.422 --> 41:48.924
Jack does.

41:49.590 --> 41:52.560
It'll be us together
at the beginning.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.602
It'll be the perfect day.

41:59.642 --> 42:00.894
(HORN BLARING)

42:04.731 --> 42:07.405
JACK: Jesus Christ.
Get your hands in the air.

42:14.323 --> 42:16.997
DEAN: You have managed
to matriculate and drop out

42:17.076 --> 42:21.377
of Tulane, Bowdoin
and the University of Chicago.

42:22.206 --> 42:26.712
Your attendance record here
is abominable.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.175
You've ignored curfew.

42:29.797 --> 42:32.220
Your papers, when you
bother to turn them in,

42:32.300 --> 42:34.849
exceed
the assigned page limit.

42:35.136 --> 42:36.353
(STAMMERS)

42:38.890 --> 42:41.609
Can you explain
why you're at Columbia?

42:42.018 --> 42:43.361
Well, the same reason you are.

42:43.478 --> 42:44.821
What is that?

42:45.730 --> 42:47.482
Loose Barnard girls.

42:52.487 --> 42:53.613
I know about
your difficulties,

42:53.696 --> 42:55.323
about what happened
in Chicago.

43:02.330 --> 43:03.707
You told him?

43:03.831 --> 43:05.208
He's not the enemy.

43:05.541 --> 43:07.919
You see, the university
acts in loco parentis.

43:09.170 --> 43:11.423
You are our responsibility.

43:11.506 --> 43:14.385
We're trying to find some way
to make this all work for you.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.052
(INAUDIBLE)

43:19.263 --> 43:21.891
Who said anybody could know
anything about anything?

43:21.974 --> 43:23.271
Lucien,
your temper.

43:23.351 --> 43:24.477
LUCIEN: Things were going fine

43:24.560 --> 43:28.406
and you're just spreading rumors
to get me kicked out of here.

43:28.481 --> 43:31.030
Allen.
What the hell's going on?

43:32.401 --> 43:33.744
Who's she?

43:34.695 --> 43:36.823
Hi. I'm Edith Cohen.

43:38.074 --> 43:39.701
What's she doing here?

43:40.034 --> 43:42.082
WOMAN: I've been
divorced for some time.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.296
I'll go wait outside.

43:44.372 --> 43:46.545
DEAN: This is the kind of
childish outburst...

43:49.210 --> 43:51.554
So that's why
you locked Mom up.

43:53.923 --> 43:55.391
DEAN: Get back here
immediately.

43:55.466 --> 43:56.968
Lucien. Lucien.

44:01.389 --> 44:02.436
Lucien!

44:02.515 --> 44:03.767
Did he put you
up to this?

44:06.686 --> 44:08.063
No.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.319
I stole the boat.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.902
And it was tremendous.

44:28.749 --> 44:30.501
Where are you going?

44:34.380 --> 44:35.927
You know me now.

44:38.259 --> 44:40.432
I'm only good at beginnings.

44:40.595 --> 44:42.347
What, you're dropping out?

44:47.143 --> 44:48.486
Best of luck.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.159
Okay.

44:56.736 --> 44:59.956
My father showed up today
with some new woman

45:00.948 --> 45:05.044
and in the middle of all the
"Allen's a screw-up" monologue,

45:05.119 --> 45:08.464
all of a sudden,
I realized I don't care.

45:11.918 --> 45:13.591
I've never not cared.

45:14.962 --> 45:17.306
So, I told them it was my idea

45:18.549 --> 45:20.096
to steal the boat.

45:21.677 --> 45:22.678
Why?

45:22.845 --> 45:26.315
Because I don't want to be
the person they think I am.

45:28.726 --> 45:31.570
I am on academic probation
and I could get kicked out.

45:31.646 --> 45:33.489
You can't leave.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.409
You started something

45:36.484 --> 45:39.488
and I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do next.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.077
It's our turn.

45:47.787 --> 45:49.960
Let's show them
what we can do.

45:52.208 --> 45:53.505
You in?

45:59.674 --> 46:02.769
LIBRARIAN: You mustn't drink while you're
handling it, and no writing in it.

46:02.843 --> 46:05.596
It comes back
exactly <i>as</i> you've got it.

46:05.721 --> 46:06.847
Next.

46:09.392 --> 46:11.986
Once you get the book,
treat it very, very well.

46:12.061 --> 46:14.905
And you don't break the binding.
Now follow me.

46:15.648 --> 46:16.695
All right.

46:21.070 --> 46:22.868
Hey, no telling Edie.

46:28.703 --> 46:30.330
Maybe you can help me
with something.

46:30.454 --> 46:32.047
You're checking out
all these books.

46:32.123 --> 46:35.218
I'm asking myself,
do you ever get checked out?

46:35.960 --> 46:38.429
Twenty-five seconds.

46:39.213 --> 46:40.339
Masterful.

46:40.423 --> 46:42.346
Hi.
Hi.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.888
Damn it. Shift's over.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.102
See you tomorrow.

46:50.391 --> 46:51.608
I'll go.

46:58.733 --> 47:02.237
Hi. Uh, lwondered
if you could help me.

47:03.070 --> 47:04.117
Sure.

47:05.156 --> 47:06.749
I'm looking for a book.

47:07.908 --> 47:09.251
Okay.

47:09.994 --> 47:11.996
Does this book have a title?

47:12.079 --> 47:13.922
Yes. Yes. Um...

47:14.248 --> 47:18.845
<i>It's</i> called
<i>The Day Amanda Came.</i>

47:24.258 --> 47:25.305
Ah.

47:27.720 --> 47:30.849
Well, um,
you'll have to wait.

47:32.183 --> 47:33.560
I can't leave the desk.

47:38.981 --> 47:40.699
I really need it.

47:46.655 --> 47:48.157
Okay.

47:50.910 --> 47:52.162
Only for you.

48:05.841 --> 48:06.933
Shit.

48:07.009 --> 48:08.727
So working here
must be a drag.

48:09.553 --> 48:12.272
I like it. It's
the only way I meet boys.

48:12.473 --> 48:14.271
They're very,
very strict at Barnard.

48:14.350 --> 48:16.193
Oh, really? How strict?

48:16.268 --> 48:19.818
Well, for example, they
would never let me do this.

48:20.606 --> 48:22.028
Right. No.

48:22.691 --> 48:23.817
Go.

48:25.653 --> 48:26.779
Did you know
I've never done it

48:26.862 --> 48:28.330
