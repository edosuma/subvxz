03:25.497 --> 03:30.676
The most stunning, haunting location
that I've ever... I've ever been to.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.804
- I can't wait to see it.
- Yeah, seriously?

03:33.922 --> 03:35.264
Yeah.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.184
So you want to do it? We're making
good time. We may as well do it.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.435
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

03:39.553 --> 03:40.645
Definitely.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.064
Maybe we should build a house up here.

03:43.182 --> 03:45.733
- Too little, too late...
- Can you hold on a second?

03:45.851 --> 03:48.945
- I'm just going to listen to this.
- ...to the point of no return.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.948
The Black Swan is visible
on the horizon,

03:52.065 --> 03:56.410
and the risk of purposeful nuclear war
right now is as high, or higher

03:56.528 --> 04:00.748
than ever before, discounting
the accidental possibilities.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.263
I'm sure it will blow over.

04:04.264 --> 04:06.629
Yeah, it's all right.
It'll be alright in the end.

04:06.747 --> 04:10.383
But... it's not the most
comforting thing

04:10.501 --> 04:13.052
to wake up to first thing
in the morning.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.137
Eh! Uuh!

04:15.255 --> 04:18.432
- That's my explorer pose for you there.
- Thank you very much, Rose.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.685
- Okay.
- All right.

04:20.802 --> 04:24.397
- Do you want me to do my explorer walk?
- Er, yes.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.023
Okay.

04:26.141 --> 04:30.247
That's the one! That's the one
I wanted to see.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.488
Look how fast the clouds
are moving over there.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.783
I know, they move really quickly.
Weather is gonna turn any minute.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.868
- No bears in Dartmoor?
- No bears.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.413
- You're a bear.
- What?!

04:40.531 --> 04:42.873
- You're a bear.
- You're a cute little cuddly bear.

04:42.991 --> 04:46.516
Wow!

04:47.871 --> 04:51.966
It is absolutely breathtaking.

04:52.084 --> 04:55.822
This is amazing.

04:58.882 --> 05:02.101
I'm rooting for you.
You've got a wet bum.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.353
You didn't say, "Be careful, love."

05:04.471 --> 05:08.441
Yeah, and that too!

05:08.559 --> 05:10.109
There you are!

05:10.227 --> 05:12.612
- Wooooh!
- Yeah!

05:12.729 --> 05:16.365
You look so small.

05:18.902 --> 05:22.121
You're the "King of the World!"
Now get back down here.

05:22.239 --> 05:25.249
- I love you, Rose!
- Yeah, shut up!

05:25.367 --> 05:30.434
Whoever said romance was dead?

05:38.547 --> 05:42.016
Woah! His hat.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.976
His leg.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.938
Tam!

05:47.055 --> 05:49.899
- Hi, darling. Did you enjoy your climb?
- Yeah.

05:50.017 --> 05:54.170
Wow! Look at that mist.

05:55.647 --> 06:02.470
Tam, darling, we're going to have a real
adventure getting back to the car.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.667
This mist is really thick. I...

06:07.784 --> 06:09.544
Do you know where the path is?

06:09.661 --> 06:11.629
What's that?

06:11.747 --> 06:12.838
What?

06:12.956 --> 06:16.778
Do you see it? At the top of the rock?

06:21.965 --> 06:26.227
What is that? It looks like...
It looks like a dog.

06:26.345 --> 06:29.772
It looks like a black dog.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.441
I feel really weird.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.735
Where did it go?

06:34.853 --> 06:38.793
It's weird, isn't it?

06:39.942 --> 06:43.077
Tam, can we please just go?

06:43.195 --> 06:46.850
Come on, let's get back to the car.

06:55.290 --> 06:59.776
- What are you looking at?
- I thought there was someone up there.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.641
So strange.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.894
Ever heard of the "Wisht Hound?"

07:08.011 --> 07:10.938
Yeah, whatever, Tam.
Can we just get off the moor?

07:16.812 --> 07:19.196
I hope we're not lost.

07:19.314 --> 07:22.673
Me, too.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.245
Perhaps we should phone
the Professor or...

07:26.363 --> 07:29.206
Arrange to come back another day.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.000
Why?

07:31.118 --> 07:34.712
Because we're just driving
around in the dark.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.215
Yeah, but we're going to get
there in the end, so don't...

07:37.332 --> 07:41.485
Right, crossroads.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.087
I don't know if it's
the right time to say,

07:44.088 --> 07:46.432
but there is a lot of
history to this house.

07:46.550 --> 07:49.310
We're only staying for the one night?

07:49.428 --> 07:53.773
Er, Phillip wants us to be there
for at least 24 hours.

07:53.891 --> 07:57.652
There's so much we could get done
if this place is what they say it is.

07:57.769 --> 08:02.156
I'm getting a little bit

08:02.274 --> 08:04.951
bored with this road.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.120
It doesn't even look like
a road, it looks like a path.

08:08.238 --> 08:11.478
Yeah.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.169
Caked on either side with boulders.

08:15.287 --> 08:19.382
Tam, I don't think we're
going the right way...

08:19.499 --> 08:23.866
- This could be it here.
- Yeah, you sure?

08:37.433 --> 08:39.860
Are you okay, Rose?
Are you feeling all right?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.821
No, but...

08:44.274 --> 08:45.533
Hello!

08:45.651 --> 08:48.160
...indicates that it's
completely out of control

08:48.278 --> 08:51.414
and the command and control
is in chaos right now.

08:51.532 --> 08:55.585
No, we're threatening
a Third World War by even thinking...

08:57.287 --> 08:59.463
Hi, mate. I'm Tam.
I spoke to you on the phone.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.465
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, mate.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.384
Excuse me.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.345
Really sorry we're late.
We got caught on Hound Tor.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.432
That place is pretty spooky.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.309
- Yeah.
- Hello.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.270
Erm, this is Rose. Tam.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.981
Hi, hi.

09:17.099 --> 09:21.444
I'm afraid we've got to shoot, actually.
We're gonna get out of here now.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.863
If we could just record
your experiences.

09:23.981 --> 09:27.783
I know we said we'd do an interview.
It's all this stuff kicking off, like.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.924
Just feel like I've got
to get back to the family.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.796
Can't spend another night in that place.
It gives us the creeps.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.211
Please don't go.
We've driven a long way.

09:43.212 --> 09:45.343
It would mean a very great deal to me.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.803
Basically, I've got this one project
that I really need to...

09:47.921 --> 09:49.639
- Sorry, man. Gotta go.
- Please.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.433
There are the keys.
You stay there if you want.

09:52.551 --> 09:56.953
But we've gotta go. Gotta go now.

09:57.306 --> 10:00.795
Sorry, guys...

10:33.550 --> 10:35.935
We can't stay here though.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.521
Rose, we've got to stay
one night at least.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.816
No, Tam! We can't stay here.
They've gone.

10:41.934 --> 10:45.672
It's not our house.

10:51.860 --> 10:57.722
Okay, I've got the camera rolling
for the grand entrance.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.964
- That's all your equipment, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

11:05.082 --> 11:08.926
So... this is your, erm,
romantic weekend away?

11:09.044 --> 11:11.387
It was never a romantic weekend.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.055
Great!

11:13.173 --> 11:17.101
- I've gotta get some work done.
- Have my wellies as well.

11:17.219 --> 11:21.502
- Perfect!
- Are we going to explore or what?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.155
Tam, I'm really scared.

11:29.273 --> 11:33.639
- Do you want me to go first?
- Yeah.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.854
Oh, God, that's grim!

11:53.088 --> 11:55.556
- Oh, it makes me sad.
- Oh, God, that's...

11:55.674 --> 11:58.726
- It does look really sad.
- There's a ladybird on it.

11:58.844 --> 12:02.647
Don't touch it! God,
this place is amazing, isn't it?

12:02.764 --> 12:05.000
What if I put that in
the bed just before...

12:05.001 --> 12:07.235
Oh, please don't. I would
never forgive you.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.531
Shall we get some more light in here?

12:12.649 --> 12:16.202
- There you go.
- Oh, that's better.

12:16.320 --> 12:20.289
Right, well, let's cozy down.

12:20.407 --> 12:24.394
They're watching you.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.887
- Okay, Tam.
- Romantic evening?

12:35.005 --> 12:37.390
Whatever you say.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.433
- Can you hold my torch for me?
- Mm-hm.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.577
Cheers.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.273
Cool, it's done.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.749
Okay. Good job.

12:51.271 --> 12:55.175
Hi, camera.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.718
Off you go exploring.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.491
Tam?

13:37.609 --> 13:40.411
I'm down here.

13:40.529 --> 13:43.289
If you're wondering where we're
going to be sleeping this evening.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.374
Yes, I am.

13:45.492 --> 13:49.212
There we are! You're on the top.
I'm on the bottom.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.422
No, I'm only joking.

13:51.540 --> 13:56.489
I've found the guest room!

14:01.758 --> 14:03.768
- Are you filming my bum?
- Yeah.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.812
Well, you're showing me
your bum, so I'm filming it.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.147
Perv!

14:08.265 --> 14:12.751
Ah! Are you coming to join me?

14:13.937 --> 14:16.447
Am I making this appealing for you?

14:18.525 --> 14:20.743
- Anyway, I'm going to sleep now.
- Yeah.

14:23.155 --> 14:28.084
So we can monitor and record
live video and audio from here.

14:28.202 --> 14:31.462
And I've got EVP audio analysis set up.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.006
EVP?

14:34.124 --> 14:36.676
Yea, electronic voice phenomena.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.636
Oh?

14:38.754 --> 14:41.222
We also have infrared night vision

14:41.340 --> 14:44.350
and motion sensor detectors via email.

14:44.468 --> 14:48.104
I've been itching to test this stuff.
This place is perfect.

14:48.222 --> 14:51.107
I would remind you that the threat
of the use of nuclear weapons

14:51.225 --> 14:54.610
constitutes a violation of
the Charter of the United Nations.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.322
There is only one question
that needs to be

14:57.323 --> 14:59.740
asked and it needs to be asked urgently.

14:59.858 --> 15:03.411
How can pre-emptive nuclear attack
as a permissible war...

15:03.529 --> 15:05.913
God, it's really getting bad, isn't it?

15:06.031 --> 15:10.647
It couldn't happen though, could it?

15:10.994 --> 15:12.753
A nuclear war?

15:12.871 --> 15:15.798
We don't need nuclear ambitions.
What we need are limitations

15:15.916 --> 15:19.524
and reductions on all nuclear weapons.

15:31.181 --> 15:34.191
There's, er, there's something
strange about this place.

15:34.309 --> 15:38.083
Some kind of atmosphere.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.785
Come on!

15:44.903 --> 15:48.122
That's totally disgusting.
Please get rid of it for me.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.209
- I put it there in the first place.
- No, you didn't!

15:51.326 --> 15:53.085
Now just...

15:58.750 --> 16:02.762
Woooo, hooo. Get in. Get in.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.431
- All right.
- It's really cold.

16:05.549 --> 16:08.539
Woah!

16:09.011 --> 16:12.396
Is this you warming me up?
Feel how cold my hands are.

16:52.429 --> 16:55.064
Just one more night.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.400
Just one more night.

16:57.518 --> 17:01.256
We'll go back tomorrow.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.036
Great!

17:09.154 --> 17:12.263
More hounds.

17:34.429 --> 17:39.275
God, Tam, this place really is
out in the middle of nowhere.

17:39.393 --> 17:44.459
It's like we're on the edge of
the world. I want to go home.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.829
It feels like the house is watching us.

17:51.947 --> 17:56.978
That's just your imagination.
Come on. Let's explore the grounds.

17:59.037 --> 18:02.381
They're very sweet.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.799
And sour.

18:12.176 --> 18:16.145
We have to address this threat
right now while we are alive.

18:45.209 --> 18:50.221
Can you put that on the side? Thanks!

18:50.339 --> 18:54.350
- Who gave that to you?
- My mum.

18:54.468 --> 18:59.416
- Your mum? What is it?
- An owl.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.294
Uh?

19:22.996 --> 19:24.338
Nothing.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.774
Nothing. Not a peep.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.221
Okay.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.141
Well, let's pack up after
breakfast and leave.

19:35.259 --> 19:39.145
Thank God!

19:41.139 --> 19:43.608
Do you think you can drop
me at my parents' place?

19:43.725 --> 19:45.234
Okay, okay.

19:45.352 --> 19:49.007
Jesus, look at this.

19:49.273 --> 19:54.553
What the hell happened in here?
Oh, my God!

19:55.445 --> 19:59.874
This is just amazing.

19:59.992 --> 20:03.753
This is right below us, Tam,
and we didn't hear a thing.

20:03.871 --> 20:07.774
How is that even possible?

20:10.627 --> 20:13.304
Was there someone in the house?

20:18.886 --> 20:21.229
Did you check the rooms?

20:21.346 --> 20:24.565
Tam, did you check the rooms? Tam?

20:24.683 --> 20:26.567
No, I haven't. I'll do that...

20:26.685 --> 20:28.611
What if whoever did this
is still in the house?

20:28.729 --> 20:31.948
Jesus! I cannot believe I didn't
set the camera up in here.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.116
What a waste!

20:34.234 --> 20:38.767
Tam, I can't believe you're
thinking about that right now.

20:40.115 --> 20:43.543
Whoever did this could
easily have hurt us as well.

20:43.660 --> 20:47.380
Isn't that a bit weird, that
somebody just destroyed the kitchen?

20:47.497 --> 20:50.737
Tam?

20:54.922 --> 20:57.348
I'm going to check
the rest of the house.

20:57.466 --> 21:00.492
Okay.

21:05.599 --> 21:09.882
I'll clean up then, shall I?

21:30.541 --> 21:34.398
Faith will be.

21:43.929 --> 21:48.497
Faith... will be.

21:56.817 --> 21:59.201
Tam?

21:59.319 --> 22:03.289
Well, we've got to stay on and
hope to record the same thing again.

22:03.407 --> 22:05.416
If I could get that on camera.

22:05.534 --> 22:07.960
Tam, this morning I heard something.

22:08.078 --> 22:09.587
Really?

22:09.705 --> 22:12.897
Yeah.

22:13.917 --> 22:17.386
In the kitchen.

22:17.504 --> 22:21.788
It was the strangest thing, like...

22:22.259 --> 22:24.977
A whispering in my ear.

22:25.095 --> 22:29.462
- And then...
- What was it, Rose?

22:30.350 --> 22:34.088
I heard a baby.

22:34.271 --> 22:37.907
I heard a baby crying, but...

22:38.025 --> 22:42.593
It wasn't the normal crying of a child.

22:43.113 --> 22:47.500
If you imagined what a child
in pain sounded like,

22:47.618 --> 22:51.771
that was the noise I heard.

23:00.088 --> 23:03.743
Can you read a name?

23:04.134 --> 23:07.812
No, it's too weather worn.

23:07.930 --> 23:10.064
It looks really sad.

23:10.182 --> 23:13.872
What are they doing out here
in the middle of nowhere?

23:19.066 --> 23:23.433
Look, there's another one here.

23:37.584 --> 23:41.655
I think, in the bag, yeah.

23:43.924 --> 23:46.017
All our things!

23:46.134 --> 23:48.269
Check the house.

23:48.387 --> 23:51.911
Check your handbag.

23:52.724 --> 23:55.276
I don't think there's anything missing.

23:55.394 --> 23:57.987
There's either someone
else in the house or...

23:58.105 --> 24:02.804
- There has to be.
- This is it. We've got evidence.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.745
Shit! It didn't record it.

24:05.863 --> 24:08.748
I don't think the most important thing
at this moment is your camera.

24:08.866 --> 24:10.499
No.

24:10.617 --> 24:15.129
I feel hugely violated. Why would
someone do this to our stuff?

24:15.247 --> 24:19.300
I don't understand. If there's nothing
missing, if they didn't take anything,

24:19.418 --> 24:22.345
then why did they just wreck the room?

24:22.462 --> 24:28.476
Tam, please, can we not stay here?
I don't want to stay here any more.

24:28.594 --> 24:32.830
I really want to go home.

25:46.922 --> 25:51.075
- Can you smell candle wax?
- Yeah, I can.

25:53.095 --> 25:55.646
It was definitely in our room.

25:55.764 --> 25:58.410
Oh, God!

26:02.855 --> 26:05.948
That was some night, wasn't it?

26:06.066 --> 26:10.883
- I've got some, er, interesting data.
- We tried.

26:11.697 --> 26:13.956
- But a hell of an experience.
- Ssh!

26:14.074 --> 26:17.460
There's someone outside the door.

26:32.593 --> 26:35.519
Who you gonna call?

26:35.637 --> 26:37.063
Harvey!

26:37.181 --> 26:38.273
All right, guys?

26:38.274 --> 26:40.942
Why didn't you tell us
you were coming?!

26:41.059 --> 26:44.070
I tried to call.

26:44.188 --> 26:46.113
Got no reception, obviously.

26:46.231 --> 26:49.158
Well, I thought I could come and
lend a hand. Get some country air.

26:49.276 --> 26:52.787
You scared the shit out of us.

26:52.905 --> 26:56.499
We'll spare you the details!

26:56.617 --> 26:58.376
- Oh, my God!
- How you doing?

26:58.493 --> 27:01.935
- Good. How are you?
- All right.

27:02.706 --> 27:06.729
What the f...?

27:07.794 --> 27:09.512
Jesus!

27:09.630 --> 27:12.598
- Yeah.
- There's some serious energy in here.

27:12.716 --> 27:16.039
Mm-hm.

27:30.943 --> 27:35.049
- This isn't coming out.
- Is it not?

27:37.115 --> 27:41.566
It's incredible, isn't it, Harv?

27:41.995 --> 27:46.090
Yeah, I've got to ask you,
Harv. I mean...

27:46.208 --> 27:48.593
...none of this was you, was it?

27:48.710 --> 27:52.365
What do you mean?

27:52.548 --> 27:55.433
You know, things are pretty
serious in the outside world.

27:55.551 --> 27:58.644
This isn't your way of, sort of,
lightening things up, is it?

27:58.762 --> 28:03.608
You seriously think I could
do something like that?

28:03.725 --> 28:05.818
No, it wasn't me.

28:05.936 --> 28:09.947
I know how seriously you
take your research.

28:10.065 --> 28:13.618
- Check this out.
- Shit!

28:13.735 --> 28:18.080
I've never seen anything like it before.
It's frozen solid.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.958
Why is it frozen here?
Why is it frozen down in this bit?

28:21.076 --> 28:26.143
- No idea.
- Check it out. It goes all the way up.

28:26.748 --> 28:30.134
- What do you make of it?
- The system isn't even on.

28:30.252 --> 28:31.969
It's just not possible.

28:32.087 --> 28:33.930
You tell me.

28:34.047 --> 28:37.558
Well, I did some checks on
the house before I arrived.

28:37.676 --> 28:41.437
And, er, yeah, the house is built on
top of several magnetic fault lines.

28:41.555 --> 28:44.065
That's often the case in
areas of high activity.

28:44.183 --> 28:48.277
But there's just no definitive line
between geology and psychic events.

28:48.395 --> 28:50.613
Yeah, but then what about radon gas?

28:50.731 --> 28:54.951
It's mostly visual hallucinations,
but this is not what we've having here.

28:55.068 --> 28:58.204
It's far beyond that.

28:58.322 --> 29:00.081
It's a sign of something.

29:00.199 --> 29:03.687
Or a warning.

29:08.332 --> 29:11.175
Come on, Rose.
Harvey only just got here.

29:11.293 --> 29:14.679
Let him stay at a least for a night.
We'll stay for one more night.

29:14.796 --> 29:17.223
Look, I've always wanted
him on a research trip

29:17.341 --> 29:19.517
and he might have some
very valid observations.

29:19.635 --> 29:22.186
No, it's not for Harvey, it's for you.

29:22.304 --> 29:25.912
Okay, it's for me, fine.

29:29.394 --> 29:32.822
You know, we've never had the
freedom that we've got here, ever.

29:32.940 --> 29:37.660
Usually, there are residents,
employees, hoaxers, for God's sake.

29:37.778 --> 29:43.011
Look, it's fine. I just wish
you'd tell me the truth.

29:48.539 --> 29:52.609
I can stay another day or so.

29:53.961 --> 29:57.200
All right?

30:31.498 --> 30:35.676
And having no other defence,
they'll deploy "Launch on Warning".

30:35.794 --> 30:38.179
We are sleepwalking to suicide.

30:38.297 --> 30:41.474
Everyone's so worried about
what's going to happen all the time.

30:41.592 --> 30:43.017
Yeah, well.

30:43.135 --> 30:48.981
Everyone will just be able to
laugh about the whole situation.

30:49.099 --> 30:51.192
It's part of the media.
It's what they do.

30:51.310 --> 30:52.985
It's the media.

30:53.103 --> 30:56.739
So everyone just needs to calm
down and it will all be fine.

30:56.857 --> 30:58.532
- Yeah?
- Are you all right?

30:58.650 --> 31:00.076
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

31:00.194 --> 31:01.369
Yep. Fine.

31:01.486 --> 31:03.579
- Get some rest.
- I'm going to get some rest.

31:03.697 --> 31:05.414
- Okay, pal.
- I'll see you in the morning.

31:05.532 --> 31:06.916
- Yeah, nice.
- Rose.

31:07.034 --> 31:10.273
Night, Harv.

32:13.058 --> 32:15.943
Thanks a lot, anyway, Tam.

32:16.061 --> 32:17.361
What?

32:17.479 --> 32:19.947
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

32:20.065 --> 32:22.867
Cos you were pacing up and down,
up and down.

32:22.985 --> 32:26.662
Don't you even sleep?
What were you doing?

32:26.780 --> 32:31.597
What do you mean, Harv? Neither of
us got up after hitting the hay.

32:32.995 --> 32:34.462
Okay.

32:34.580 --> 32:39.196
- Come on, I heard you.
- No, serious! We didn't.

32:40.878 --> 32:43.691
Okay.

32:43.881 --> 32:48.034
Must mean there's someone
else in the house.

32:52.347 --> 32:56.984
How many of these bloody cameras have
you got, Tam? They're everywhere.

32:59.062 --> 33:01.958
Tam!

33:06.361 --> 33:07.662
Okay.

33:07.779 --> 33:10.957
This may sound crazy,

33:11.074 --> 33:15.062
but that plant was just moving.

33:15.746 --> 33:18.339
Moving? Are you sure it wasn't
a draught? It's by a window.

33:18.457 --> 33:23.761
No, no, no. I mean moving, as in,
somebody was... tending to it.

33:23.879 --> 33:26.055
It was... it was weird.

33:26.173 --> 33:29.517
- What's that?
- It's an EMF detector.

33:29.635 --> 33:31.477
- Let me see.
- No jokes, right?

33:31.595 --> 33:33.646
No jokes, no jokes.

33:33.764 --> 33:37.917
- This is crazy.
- I'm telling you, Harv.

33:47.819 --> 33:50.715
Hello?

33:53.534 --> 33:56.809
Hi, there!

34:51.507 --> 34:53.059
WAAAAH!

34:53.177 --> 34:57.662
You fucking arsehole!

35:05.856 --> 35:07.406
Jesus Christ!

35:07.524 --> 35:10.368
- Shit!
- What?

35:10.485 --> 35:12.161
What, What, what?

35:12.279 --> 35:14.705
There's something on the stairs.
Right there. Did you see it?

35:14.823 --> 35:16.832
- No...
- Right in here.

35:16.950 --> 35:19.794
Right here.

35:19.912 --> 35:23.977
I can't tell if it's
this house or if it's you.

35:23.978 --> 35:25.441
Couldn't be me.

35:27.252 --> 35:30.096
Rose. Rose, I saw something
on the stairs.

35:30.214 --> 35:32.515
Rose, I saw something on the stairs.
I actually saw it.

35:32.633 --> 35:36.352
- What did you see?
- It was like a... like a shimmering.

35:36.470 --> 35:40.273
Sort of a grey shimmering.

35:40.390 --> 35:45.208
I know. I saw it. It's been there
half an hour or so.

35:46.563 --> 35:49.615
You saw it, too?

35:49.733 --> 35:52.252
Well, why didn't you tell me?
We could have

35:52.253 --> 35:54.829
recorded it. We could
have got some footage.

35:54.947 --> 35:57.760
Rose.

36:00.702 --> 36:03.646
Rose.

36:10.420 --> 36:16.413
I want to leave, Tam. I'm sorry.
I can't stay here any longer.

36:23.100 --> 36:27.550
- Can we just go, please?
- I'm not going to leave.

36:34.820 --> 36:38.289
Rose, this place has every chance
of being a genuine haunting.

36:38.407 --> 36:43.878
Is it just obsession with all this stuff
or is it partly disinterest in me?

36:43.996 --> 36:46.005
Oh, Rose.

36:46.123 --> 36:49.008
Why would you say
this to me now, here? Why?

36:49.126 --> 36:51.336
I mean, have you got
any idea how hard it is to

36:51.337 --> 36:53.638
get funding for postgraduate
study in this field?

36:53.755 --> 36:55.431
Have you any idea whatsoever?

36:55.549 --> 37:00.228
- Jesus, Rose, we discussed this.
- I think things have changed a bit

37:00.345 --> 37:02.813
since we discussed that, Tam.

37:02.931 --> 37:06.776
Have you even noticed
what's going on out there? I mean...

37:06.894 --> 37:11.545
Nothing we can do. Nothing.

37:12.191 --> 37:16.807
Harvey's right. What can
ordinary people do? Sit and wait.

37:17.196 --> 37:19.830
There is someone else
in the house, Tam. I saw her.

37:19.948 --> 37:22.541
I know. On the stairs,
this afternoon, you said.

37:22.659 --> 37:26.128
No, that wasn't her.

37:26.246 --> 37:28.422
I saw her outside.

37:28.540 --> 37:31.899
Where?

37:34.087 --> 37:38.158
I'm sure it was here.

37:42.596 --> 37:44.564
Here?

37:44.681 --> 37:47.233
Are sure? Really?

37:47.351 --> 37:52.750
It was here, Tam. There was
a beautiful flower garden.

37:53.065 --> 37:56.507
It's gone.

37:57.319 --> 38:00.329
You don't believe me, do you?

38:00.447 --> 38:05.063
Well, I don't see any
beautiful flower garden.

38:06.245 --> 38:11.691
- What are they?
- They look like high-altitude bombers.

38:13.418 --> 38:18.533
- God, I just hope they're on exercise.
- Bloody hell.

38:53.709 --> 38:55.843
What's going on?

38:55.961 --> 38:59.948
Oh, God! There was someone there.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.895
Jesus Christ!

39:07.681 --> 39:09.982
- There's no one there.
- Oh! There was.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.109
- Calm down.
- There was someone there.

39:12.227 --> 39:15.800
Wait, wait, wait.

39:20.736 --> 39:22.703
What was that?

39:27.993 --> 39:32.313
I've fucking had it with this guy.

39:35.584 --> 39:39.607
I think we should stay up here.

39:43.634 --> 39:48.166
Oh... look at this.

39:48.472 --> 39:51.332
Oh, shit.

40:34.768 --> 40:38.542
He's in here.

40:47.698 --> 40:50.499
- He's in here, he's in here.
- Yeah.

40:50.617 --> 40:52.335
You ready?

40:52.452 --> 40:54.462
Fucking right I am.

40:59.209 --> 41:02.011
- Oh, God!
- What the fuck is that?

41:02.129 --> 41:04.823
Oh!

41:06.049 --> 41:08.392
It's literally freezing in here.

41:10.512 --> 41:14.416
- Jesus! Go!
- Where's it gone?

41:16.226 --> 41:20.332
What was that?

41:21.732 --> 41:24.283
There is power to the house.

41:24.401 --> 41:29.847
So these power cuts...
I just can't explain them.

41:31.658 --> 41:35.266
There it is again.

41:37.539 --> 41:40.550
I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.

41:44.463 --> 41:48.995
The way it got in. It's coming again,
it's coming again.

41:51.386 --> 41:54.272
And it's the same in here.
The temperature's just...

41:54.389 --> 41:57.275
- Just dropped.
- Just dropped instantly.

41:57.392 --> 42:00.152
Instantly.

42:00.270 --> 42:04.115
The crisis becomes financial M,
as share prices drop.

42:04.233 --> 42:09.050
The Dow Jones and Nikkei down
a further 30 percent.

43:08.714 --> 43:10.681
Harvey! Harvey!

43:10.799 --> 43:14.352
There's someone right behind you.

43:14.469 --> 43:17.813
I know, I know, Rose.
He's just touched my arm.

43:17.931 --> 43:20.983
I can feel it.

43:21.101 --> 43:23.569
Something moving around us.

43:23.687 --> 43:26.781
Hello?

43:26.899 --> 43:29.379
Uuuh!

43:34.907 --> 43:37.166
We didn't imagine that. No.

43:41.496 --> 43:44.966
- It's warm in here, guys.
- God, Tam, you missed it.

43:45.083 --> 43:49.320
Missed what? Harvey?

43:49.838 --> 43:53.391
I've never been so scared in my life.

43:53.509 --> 43:55.518
- Right, that's it.
- Jesus, I'm sweating.

43:55.636 --> 43:57.353
- I'm calling the Professor.
- Eh?

43:57.471 --> 44:00.773
- No, Tam, we have to leave.
- There's something happening here.

44:00.891 --> 44:05.570
Harvey feels it. I'm calling
the Professor and that's that.

44:05.687 --> 44:09.238
This is rare, honestly.
You don't get this.

44:09.239 --> 44:10.422
Thanks, Tam.

44:10.859 --> 44:14.432
Thanks a lot.

44:22.746 --> 44:25.440
Oh!

44:36.385 --> 44:39.145
The Black Swan is already
over the horizon.

44:39.263 --> 44:42.356
She is approaching.
She will arrive in a matter of days.

44:42.474 --> 44:44.358
She will then lay her offspring.

44:44.476 --> 44:46.402
- Where's Harv?
- Huh?

44:46.520 --> 44:49.113
- Where's Harv?
- Not sure.

44:49.231 --> 44:52.700
Just trying to get his stuff down.
Nothing has recorded yet.

44:52.818 --> 44:57.469
Hi, matey. How you doing?

45:02.828 --> 45:05.504
I can't stay here any more, Tam.

45:05.622 --> 45:09.312
Because of last night?

45:11.336 --> 45:15.525
Harv, what's wrong?

45:18.802 --> 45:22.063
I saw Sam last night.

45:22.181 --> 45:24.440
Sam? You saw Sam?

45:24.558 --> 45:27.632
Mm.

45:29.688 --> 45:33.296
I'm sorry. Sam?

45:34.359 --> 45:38.537
When I was 14, my...

45:38.655 --> 45:41.916
My brother was killed in an accident.

45:42.034 --> 45:44.293
He was, er...

45:44.411 --> 45:47.255
Cycling home and he was hit by a car,

45:47.372 --> 45:51.479
and it killed him instantly.

45:53.587 --> 45:57.223
One minute he was there
and the next he was gone.

45:57.341 --> 46:02.040
Oh, God, Harv, I'm so sorry.

46:02.596 --> 46:06.879
Are you sure it wasn't a dream?

46:08.769 --> 46:11.487
Sure?

46:11.605 --> 46:13.823
He was there.

46:13.941 --> 46:17.702
He was stood there. He was trying to...

46:17.819 --> 46:20.454
He was talking to me.

46:20.572 --> 46:24.643
What did he say, Harv?

46:25.118 --> 46:28.004
He said that he wanted to help,

46:28.121 --> 46:31.507
but he couldn't and soon
it wouldn't matter anyway.

46:31.625 --> 46:33.926
Okay, Harv. Just relax, okay?

46:34.044 --> 46:37.430
Why don't we just wait for
the Professor to get here

46:37.548 --> 46:41.809
and we'll see what he thinks
and we'll take it from there.

46:41.927 --> 46:46.460
- It's just this house.
- I know, I know.

46:48.267 --> 46:50.318
Airstrikes need to be ramped up.

46:50.435 --> 46:54.030
Meanwhile, Germany has come under fire
for abstaining on the UN's vote

46:54.147 --> 46:58.847
to commit military assets,
for fear of being sucked into a war.

47:11.832 --> 47:14.941
That's him.

47:17.504 --> 47:18.721
Morning.

47:18.839 --> 47:22.058
Morning, Professor.

47:22.176 --> 47:23.935
- Remember Rose?
- Hi again.

47:24.052 --> 47:24.607
Hi, Rose.

47:24.608 --> 47:26.270
This is Harvey Waller,
an old friend of mine.

47:26.388 --> 47:28.648
Just joined us to have
some fun at our expense.

47:28.765 --> 47:31.817
- Well, that's a good use of resources.
- Well, that was the idea.

47:31.935 --> 47:33.903
- And you are a...?
- A Geophysicist.

47:34.021 --> 47:38.756
Oh, good. Well, welcome aboard, Harvey.

47:39.318 --> 47:42.453
Well, Tam and myself
did discuss the fault lines.

47:42.571 --> 47:45.873
Well, there is another theory
to take into account.

47:45.991 --> 47:48.546
That a form of energy, a sub-microwave

47:48.547 --> 47:51.504
level radiation,
is released by the fault,

47:51.622 --> 47:55.383
and that, in some way, interacts
with the human neural system.

47:55.501 --> 48:01.528
Does it make us more psychic
or does it make us hallucinate?

48:01.798 --> 48:04.183
It's impossible to be
certain at this point.

48:04.301 --> 48:08.020
Well, Professor, a day ago,
I would have laughed at such a theory.

48:08.138 --> 48:10.189
But now?

48:10.307 --> 48:14.590
There's definitely
something in this house.

48:17.731 --> 48:20.950
What is your actual field, Professor?

48:21.068 --> 48:26.122
Astronomy, although I do have a very
healthy interest in the paranormal.

48:26.240 --> 48:29.041
Astronomy, wow!

48:29.159 --> 48:32.003
But I don't see a connection.

48:32.120 --> 48:35.423
Well, the universe is
a complicated place.

48:35.541 --> 48:38.885
And the more we study it,
the less we seem to understand it.

48:39.002 --> 48:42.930
I've just spent many years
pondering time and space,

48:43.048 --> 48:46.017
and so I suppose I've
come to a conclusion that

48:46.134 --> 48:49.937
perhaps humans might exist, operate,

48:50.055 --> 48:52.899
independently of time and space.

48:53.016 --> 48:57.278
Which leaves me to wonder if
perhaps we can't also operate

48:57.396 --> 49:01.763
independently of mortality.

49:02.234 --> 49:03.701
Ghosts.

49:03.819 --> 49:06.913
You're talking about ghosts, aren't you?

49:07.030 --> 49:10.041
The human mind is
a force in this universe,

49:10.158 --> 49:14.775
which we know very little about.

49:24.923 --> 49:28.246
Professor.

49:43.358 --> 49:45.826
Did you manage to get all this on film?

49:45.944 --> 49:49.622
- None of it.
- Ah.

49:49.740 --> 49:53.668
As regards The Tor, I have heard
of similar events, of course.

49:53.785 --> 49:56.128
A time slip, perhaps.

49:56.246 --> 49:58.673
A ripple in time.

49:58.790 --> 50:03.844
Or you may have been experiencing
someone else's memory of the place.

50:03.962 --> 50:06.764
The Tor has got a great deal
of history attached to it.

50:06.882 --> 50:10.476
It's been a hotbed of paranormal
activity since records began,

50:10.594 --> 50:14.063
but so much seems to be happening here,

50:14.181 --> 50:18.038
it's hard to keep up.

50:19.520 --> 50:22.508
I'm wondering if perhaps
this house isn't

50:22.509 --> 50:25.283
acting as some sort of psychic beacon,

50:25.400 --> 50:28.744
and that everything that is happening
out there in the greater world

50:28.862 --> 50:31.789
is in some way influencing events here,

50:31.907 --> 50:38.546
just making them more pronounced,
amplifying them, if you will.

50:38.664 --> 50:42.466
Tam, I'm also worried about Rose.

50:42.584 --> 50:45.303
Look, I know she doesn't like it here.

50:45.420 --> 50:49.390
I suggest that the opposite
might well be true.

50:49.508 --> 50:52.101
In a very short period of time,

50:52.219 --> 50:54.937
Rose seems to have developed
a profound spiritual

50:55.055 --> 51:00.454
and emotional connection to this place.

51:26.712 --> 51:30.139
Today to respond to
a situation of great gravity.

51:30.257 --> 51:34.268
We are here because, for the first time
in several generations,

51:34.386 --> 51:37.605
British forces, along with
the forces of their NATO allies,

51:37.723 --> 51:39.667
are now in a state of
extreme readiness...

51:39.668 --> 51:40.358
Good heavens.

51:40.475 --> 51:43.945
I can hear whispering.

51:44.062 --> 51:46.072
Lower the television.

51:46.190 --> 51:49.963
Yesterday was a day of rumor and...

51:51.570 --> 51:53.829
This is exactly the sort of thing
that's been happening.

51:53.947 --> 51:55.581
I'm glad you're here to witness this.

51:55.699 --> 51:57.908
All right. Look, what
we have to do is, we

51:57.909 --> 52:00.169
have to just attack
this situation head on.

52:00.287 --> 52:02.713
All right? We need to get involved
in a way that we'll understand

52:02.831 --> 52:05.883
that whatever is happening
here can't harm us.

52:06.001 --> 52:07.927
We have to take the
stress out of the situation.

52:08.045 --> 52:10.763
That's exactly what I was thinking
about when I saw my brother Sam.

52:13.342 --> 52:18.187
Harvey! Harvey! Where are you?

52:18.305 --> 52:20.690
Professor? It's Harvey.
I think something has him.

52:20.807 --> 52:22.316
- Harvey!
- Harvey!

52:22.434 --> 52:23.547
Harvey!

52:23.664 --> 52:25.611
Get him down. Oh, let him go!

52:25.729 --> 52:28.239
Have you got him?

52:30.359 --> 52:32.326
- Are you okay?
- Harvey, are you with us?

52:32.444 --> 52:34.161
- Is he all right?
- I'm fine.

52:34.279 --> 52:35.830
- Yeah, I think he's okay.
- I'm fine!

52:35.948 --> 52:38.541
He's okay.

52:38.659 --> 52:41.502
Right, I'm going to get water.

52:41.620 --> 52:44.672
I'm fine.

52:44.790 --> 52:48.217
You were thrown ten feet right across
the room in front of my very eyes.

52:48.335 --> 52:51.053
In 20 years of research, I've never
seen anything like that before.

52:51.171 --> 52:53.890
Now are you convinced we should leave?

52:54.007 --> 52:57.476
It felt like a bang, right in my ribs.

52:59.638 --> 53:01.856
I can't even explain it.

53:01.974 --> 53:03.566
Good gracious!

53:03.684 --> 53:06.110
- Not again!
- Where's Rose?

53:06.228 --> 53:09.966
Professor, where's Rose?

53:11.608 --> 53:15.097
Rose!

53:16.071 --> 53:17.788
You all right?

53:17.906 --> 53:21.348
Mind the steps.

53:21.827 --> 53:24.722
Rosie!

53:24.913 --> 53:28.382
I'll take up here, you go downstairs.

53:28.500 --> 53:31.677
Professor, she's down here.

53:31.795 --> 53:35.264
- Where is she?
- She's down there in the corner.

53:35.382 --> 53:38.788
Take this.

53:40.971 --> 53:43.439
Is she okay?

53:43.557 --> 53:47.924
Oh, there's this oppression.

53:52.941 --> 53:55.368
Oh, he's hurting her.

53:55.485 --> 53:57.787
And he won't stop.

53:57.905 --> 54:02.011
Who's hurting her, Rose? Who?

54:03.327 --> 54:07.255
- Rosie.
- Tam, is that you?

54:07.372 --> 54:08.506
Oh!

54:08.624 --> 54:12.552
I feel a thousand years old.

54:12.669 --> 54:16.491
What's that in your hand?

54:33.440 --> 54:36.826
Fifteen Minute alert. If launched,
they cannot be recalled,

54:36.944 --> 54:39.870
and will strike their targets
in roughly 30 minutes.

54:39.988 --> 54:43.374
World nuclear war is now
a real possibility.

54:53.377 --> 54:55.469
How's Rose?

54:55.587 --> 54:57.388
She's okay. She's sleeping.

54:57.506 --> 55:00.283
Tam!

55:01.134 --> 55:04.854
I've spoken to Muriel and luckily
she's agreed to come at once.

55:04.972 --> 55:07.648
I'm going to collect her.
I'll be back first thing in the morning.

55:07.766 --> 55:09.161
Should Rose go with you?

55:09.162 --> 55:11.736
No. I want Muriel
to evaluate her situation.

55:11.854 --> 55:15.990
I think she really needs
Muriel's special sensitivity.

55:16.108 --> 55:18.576
You look after yourselves, all right?

55:18.694 --> 55:21.495
Strange as it may seem,
considering what's going on out there,

55:21.613 --> 55:25.601
this might be the safest place for you.

55:44.303 --> 55:48.409
What does it mean, Harvey?

55:54.813 --> 55:57.490
So this, er...

55:57.608 --> 56:00.201
This Muriel.

56:00.319 --> 56:02.620
You've never mentioned her before.

56:02.738 --> 56:04.205
Muriel Roy.

56:04.323 --> 56:06.832
I've never met her before.

56:06.950 --> 56:09.502
I've heard stories about her.

56:09.620 --> 56:14.853
She and the Professor, they work
together in certain situations.

56:15.375 --> 56:18.636
Situations? What's...

56:18.754 --> 56:22.824
When things get serious, Harvey.

56:24.343 --> 56:27.979
Mind the step. Okay, here we are.

56:28.096 --> 56:30.690
Okay, Muriel, Harvey is here.

56:30.807 --> 56:33.901
And Tam.

56:34.019 --> 56:37.709
What is it?

56:41.693 --> 56:44.803
Ssh! Ssh!

56:49.493 --> 56:53.231
That's the basement.

56:56.291 --> 56:59.448
Careful.

57:05.884 --> 57:07.476
All right?

57:07.594 --> 57:10.289
Yes.

57:21.859 --> 57:26.309
The feeling in this place is so wrong.

57:31.076 --> 57:34.933
There's so much pain.

57:36.415 --> 57:39.939
So much loss.

57:42.421 --> 57:45.056
- There's a chair for you here, Muriel.
- Thank you.

57:45.174 --> 57:47.308
- All right?
- Yeah.

57:47.426 --> 57:51.687
There was a man on the stairs
as soon as I came in. I saw him there.

57:51.805 --> 57:54.440
- Is that all?
- Oh... no.

57:54.558 --> 57:58.110
There are pockets of energy
all over the basement.

57:58.228 --> 58:00.154
Vibrations.

58:00.272 --> 58:05.409
There seem to be spirits trapped, but
unable to move on from where they died.

58:05.527 --> 58:09.622
There are so many.
I've never known anything like it.

58:09.740 --> 58:12.166
What about a spirit board?

58:12.284 --> 58:14.331
Could we use one to contact them?

58:14.332 --> 58:16.963
I don't think that's a good idea.
Muriel?

58:17.080 --> 58:19.674
Well...

58:19.791 --> 58:23.094
Using a spirit board's not unlike
posting a sign to your door

58:23.212 --> 58:25.596
that reads "anyone welcome".

58:25.714 --> 58:29.892
I wouldn't recommend its use here,
not in this house.

58:30.010 --> 58:31.123
Why?

58:31.240 --> 58:33.772
Sooner or later,
something really bad's going

58:33.773 --> 58:36.023
to enter, something with bad intention.

58:36.141 --> 58:42.584
Believe me, it isn't as easy to get rid
of them as it is to invite them in.

58:51.448 --> 58:54.500
Muriel, is it okay if
I film the sitting?

58:54.618 --> 58:57.514
Yes.

58:59.039 --> 59:02.091
Lucia.

59:02.209 --> 59:05.094
No, wait. It's more like...

59:05.212 --> 59:08.238
Luca...

59:08.715 --> 59:10.182
Lu...

59:10.300 --> 59:13.659
Lu... Lucasta.

59:14.221 --> 59:17.034
Lucasta.

59:17.599 --> 59:21.788
Her name keeps coming again and again.

59:25.274 --> 59:28.117
Oh, my! Her agitation's increasing.

59:28.235 --> 59:32.518
I'm awakening her recollection.

59:34.992 --> 59:37.501
I can see bare walls

59:37.619 --> 59:41.061
and a bare room.

59:43.250 --> 59:47.321
And an overwhelming sense
of being trapped.

59:47.921 --> 59:52.372
Oh, my darling you should not be here.

59:54.720 --> 59:58.541
Oh, you poor thing.

01:00:06.565 --> 01:00:10.243
I'm feeling pain here.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.473
No!

01:00:11.591 --> 01:00:14.705
- You all right?
- Oh, yes. Yeah.

01:00:14.823 --> 01:00:17.500
Oh, that's quite enough of that.

01:00:17.618 --> 01:00:20.561
Oh!

01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:29.220
It is unusual for an entity to

01:00:29.338 --> 01:00:33.558
reveal itself and give so much
information so quickly.

01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:37.853
The story you're describing does bear
more than a passing resemblance

01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:40.856
to one associated to
the history of this house.

01:00:40.974 --> 01:00:44.026
The girl could well be, er...

01:00:44.144 --> 01:00:46.279
Lucasta Norcliffe.

01:00:46.396 --> 01:00:52.076
She was orphaned at the age
of nine and adopted by her uncle.

01:00:52.194 --> 01:00:56.872
Legend has it that he abused her and...

01:00:59.535 --> 01:01:01.961
I'm sorry. I'm finding this
rather difficult to talk about.

01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:06.966
It's all right, Phillip. It's more
than just a story now, isn't it?

01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:09.468
Yes.

01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:12.930
Of course. Thank you.

01:01:13.048 --> 01:01:16.225
He abused her sexually

01:01:16.343 --> 01:01:21.480
and kept her locked away in one
of the rooms in this house.

01:01:21.598 --> 01:01:23.274
For many years, Phillip?

01:01:23.392 --> 01:01:27.194
Until her death at 18 years of age.

01:01:27.312 --> 01:01:31.032
The poor, poor girl.

01:01:31.149 --> 01:01:33.492
If it is indeed Lucasta's story,

01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:37.163
then I'm afraid it's far worse than
any of us could possibly imagine.

01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:40.166
You see, she gave birth to

01:01:40.284 --> 01:01:42.877
several stillborn children.

01:01:42.995 --> 01:01:44.503
Christ!

01:01:44.621 --> 01:01:48.799
Although two babies did live,
they were...

01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:53.596
They were murdered.
They were murdered and burnt.

01:01:53.714 --> 01:01:58.392
That's What I heard, Tam. I heard them.

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:02.912
Lucasta eventually died in childbirth.

01:02:03.515 --> 01:02:06.567
Professor, why haven't you
told any of this to us before?

01:02:06.685 --> 01:02:10.321
This house dates back from
the 14th century, Tam.

01:02:10.439 --> 01:02:14.116
There are many stories
spanning many generations.

01:02:14.234 --> 01:02:19.538
This was just one of them, albeit
a particularly tragic and horrible one.

01:02:19.656 --> 01:02:26.230
Until Muriel here mentioned the name
Lucasta, well, I simply had no idea.

01:02:26.455 --> 01:02:30.216
When I enter a place, I go back in time,

01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:37.306
peel back the layers, the layers of
the psychic history of the house.

01:02:37.424 --> 01:02:39.934
When things occur,
they're occurring all the time,

01:02:40.052 --> 01:02:43.437
in every place, in every building.

01:02:43.555 --> 01:02:47.191
They're usually the result
of some emotional event.

01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:49.902
And this girl, Lucasta,

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.862
is she, er...

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:56.784
Well, I'm afraid the world she inhabits
is a dark and gloomy one.

01:02:56.902 --> 01:03:00.889
And she's trapped.

01:03:04.618 --> 01:03:09.602
Can I ask you something, Rose?
Have you seen her?

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:13.050
I saw somebody.

01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:16.762
What did she look like?

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.057
I only saw her
for three or four seconds.

01:03:20.175 --> 01:03:24.687
It was more an outline
than the whole of her.

01:03:24.805 --> 01:03:26.939
I couldn't see her face.

01:03:27.057 --> 01:03:30.443
I think she's been trying to
contact you since you arrived.

01:03:30.561 --> 01:03:34.238
She's adrift.

01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:37.450
You see, what she sees in you is you

01:03:37.568 --> 01:03:40.995
display some degree of
illumination in the next level,

01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:44.874
the level which she inhabits.

01:03:44.992 --> 01:03:50.687
What she saw in you was a light
in the darkness or

01:03:51.248 --> 01:03:54.884
the fact that help was
available and so it was.

01:03:55.002 --> 01:03:58.596
It's time to help her.

01:03:58.714 --> 01:04:02.238
Okay? Okay?

01:04:06.972 --> 01:04:09.690
This ring, is it yours?

01:04:09.808 --> 01:04:13.630
No, I found it.

01:04:14.229 --> 01:04:18.003
But I think it was hers.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.700
Yeah.

01:04:19.818 --> 01:04:23.556
I think it is too.

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:31.295
It's the same as before.
What do you think, Professor?

01:04:31.413 --> 01:04:34.131
Whatever is happening here, Tam,

01:04:34.249 --> 01:04:37.510
there is no doubt the effect
seems to be increasing.

01:04:37.628 --> 01:04:40.680
I just hope Muriel can deal with this.

01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:44.058
But, frankly, I'm worried.

01:04:44.176 --> 01:04:47.728
This is a tainted place, Phillip.

01:04:47.846 --> 01:04:50.856
Tell me more.

01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:55.570
The spiritual agonies of that poor girl
must have been too much to bear.

01:04:55.687 --> 01:05:00.658
Locked in that room, her babies gone,
probably murdered,

01:05:00.776 --> 01:05:05.454
without the comfort
of a Christian burial.

01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:10.058
In those times, with nothing said,

01:05:10.244 --> 01:05:15.506
without God to take them away,
their chances of going to heaven gone.

01:05:15.624 --> 01:05:18.509
Look, you really don't have to do this.

01:05:18.627 --> 01:05:21.762
- No, Phillip.
- In fact, I urge you not to.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:25.903
It has to be done tonight.

01:05:39.314 --> 01:05:43.826
I'd like all here to remain still.

01:05:43.944 --> 01:05:48.164
Let's try and think of Lucasta as

01:05:48.282 --> 01:05:52.627
a person who's been lost for many years,

01:05:52.744 --> 01:05:57.028
trapped between these Worlds.

01:05:57.207 --> 01:06:00.134
Who's about to take
a big step in her life

01:06:00.252 --> 01:06:04.868
and be free for the
first time in a long time.

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:12.104
I'm going to put a proposition to her.

01:06:12.222 --> 01:06:16.245
And ask her if she's ready
to come on a journey.

01:06:20.564 --> 01:06:23.366
I'm going to create an energy

01:06:23.483 --> 01:06:27.305
that she can move in.

01:06:32.618 --> 01:06:36.522
I can see a brook.

01:06:37.289 --> 01:06:41.193
There's a brook.

01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:46.442
And there's a bridge coming into view.

01:06:48.467 --> 01:06:52.288
She can see it too.

01:06:56.767 --> 01:06:58.943
She's crossing the bridge too.

01:06:59.061 --> 01:07:01.445
Wait!

01:07:01.563 --> 01:07:06.429
Are you going to be okay?
Are you going to be safe?

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.537
She's thanking me.

01:07:09.655 --> 01:07:12.748
She's thanking Rose and...

01:07:12.866 --> 01:07:16.937
She's thanking you all for being here.

01:07:22.167 --> 01:07:25.905
And she's free.

01:07:30.592 --> 01:07:34.081
I don't believe it,
I can smell flowers.

01:07:34.082 --> 01:07:35.244
So can I.

01:07:39.935 --> 01:07:43.237
No, wait. There's somebody else here.

01:07:55.617 --> 01:07:59.854
Nothing. No one here.

01:08:06.712 --> 01:08:12.158
- Are you all right, Muriel?
- It's okay, Phillip, it's passed.

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:16.997
I have still not cleared this place.

01:08:18.807 --> 01:08:21.567
Christ, Professor, what else
do we know about this man?

01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:24.111
Very little, I'm afraid.

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:27.490
In those times, if someone
committed a terrible crime,

01:08:27.608 --> 01:08:31.786
their name was struck from the records,
so we know virtually nothing about him,

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:34.622
other than what the legend tells us.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:38.584
His name might be struck from
the records but he certainly isn't.

01:08:38.702 --> 01:08:41.962
What was evil then is
obviously still evil today.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.633
We just have to concentrate on
what is happening here and now.

01:08:45.751 --> 01:08:48.928
This is what H-bombs do. They massacre.

01:08:49.046 --> 01:08:53.015
This system of ongoing, perpetual war
is an unsustainable system

01:08:53.133 --> 01:08:55.977
that threatens the existence
of all life on Planet Earth.

01:08:56.094 --> 01:09:00.481
You have to understand that there is
no defence against "Launch on Warning".

01:09:00.599 --> 01:09:03.412
They won't die alone.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.404
The reason she was trapped
was her sadness.

01:09:48.522 --> 01:09:53.138
There was no thought of revenge.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.921
Sorry, Professor, but can I
ask you a question about Muriel?

01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:07.215
Yes, by all means.

01:10:07.332 --> 01:10:10.718
How does she...

01:10:10.836 --> 01:10:13.012
How does she do what she does?

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:18.809
Well, I believe that there is a channel,
a communications channel, if you will,

01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:22.271
and mediums like Muriel
are able to tune into it.

01:10:22.389 --> 01:10:24.398
But how is that possible?

01:10:24.516 --> 01:10:27.401
Well, I wish I could answer
that question for you, Harvey.

01:10:27.519 --> 01:10:31.030
All I can say is that science doesn't
seem to know how she does it either.

01:10:31.148 --> 01:10:35.117
But I have no doubt that she acts
as a channel between this side

01:10:35.235 --> 01:10:41.014
and the communicating intelligence,
in this case, Lucasta.

01:10:42.492 --> 01:10:45.253
Beautiful flower garden.

01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:48.480
Oh, Rose.

01:10:57.925 --> 01:11:03.454
Rose, I don't want you
involved in any more of this.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.315
Rose, I don't.
I've spoken to the Professor.

01:11:06.433 --> 01:11:11.749
Tam, lam more a part of this
now than anybody else.

01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:15.741
I want to face

01:11:15.859 --> 01:11:20.788
that cowardly, vile, evil man,

01:11:20.906 --> 01:11:24.834
and I want him to know
that we know what he did

01:11:24.952 --> 01:11:27.628
and that he can't hide
from it any longer.

01:11:27.746 --> 01:11:29.922
Rose, I don't like
the direction this is going.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:35.819
Tam, it was always heading
in this direction, as you put it.

01:11:36.463 --> 01:11:39.932
This is something I have to do.
It's important to me.

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:43.269
- Okay.
- It's real.

01:11:43.387 --> 01:11:46.081
Okay.

01:11:46.515 --> 01:11:50.087
I'm sorry, Rose.

01:11:52.312 --> 01:11:54.906
I've got something to show you.

01:11:55.023 --> 01:11:58.492
It was... it was here.

01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.953
I believe you, Tam.

01:12:01.071 --> 01:12:03.623
I just wish you'd believed me.

01:12:16.962 --> 01:12:19.555
I know that's him, Tam.

01:12:19.673 --> 01:12:23.142
I can feel it.

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:26.832
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.361
The research has now given
to something else entirely.

01:12:33.478 --> 01:12:36.280
We do have a real
and important mystery here.

01:12:36.398 --> 01:12:39.450
And I think I speak for the entire
group gathered together in the house,

01:12:39.568 --> 01:12:42.662
under now what area quite
exceptional circumstances.

01:12:42.779 --> 01:12:46.958
And that our seeing this through
is important and necessary.

01:12:47.075 --> 01:12:49.710
It's going to be very
different from last time.

01:12:49.828 --> 01:12:54.131
So I want you to place your hands
on your solar plexus, like this.

01:12:54.249 --> 01:12:59.198
And don't speak.
Whatever happens don't speak.

01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:09.163
I can see him now.

01:13:09.848 --> 01:13:15.413
You've been wandering for many years.

01:13:17.439 --> 01:13:21.676
He wants to know
who all these people are.

01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:27.290
I'm asking him the question.

01:13:27.407 --> 01:13:30.042
Would you like to leave this place?

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:34.728
Would you like to pass through?

01:13:35.457 --> 01:13:37.967
He's telling me no.

01:13:38.085 --> 01:13:40.636
He's enjoying himself too much.

01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:45.204
He says it's because
he enjoys the power.

01:13:46.426 --> 01:13:50.248
He likes the control.

01:13:50.556 --> 01:13:53.441
It reminds him of when
he practiced black magic.

01:13:56.311 --> 01:14:00.865
No! No! No! No!

01:14:00.983 --> 01:14:05.350
He's telling me he still wants to
kill people even though he's dead.

01:14:05.612 --> 01:14:08.664
I will never leave this place!

01:14:08.782 --> 01:14:10.875
No! No!

01:14:10.993 --> 01:14:13.794
No!

01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:16.214
No, I can't do it any more.

01:14:16.331 --> 01:14:18.549
I can't do that any more.

01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:22.156
I'm sorry.

01:14:28.468 --> 01:14:34.413
What we would usually do in oases
like this is try to break their mind.

01:14:36.643 --> 01:14:41.781
To let them know what they've
done and that they are dead.

01:14:41.899 --> 01:14:45.826
Because most of them
don't actually know that.

01:14:45.944 --> 01:14:50.395
And then they become
like normal human beings.

01:14:51.033 --> 01:14:54.723
But with him...

01:14:55.204 --> 01:14:57.880
With him, it feels very different.

01:14:57.998 --> 01:14:59.757
How?

01:14:59.875 --> 01:15:03.427
How is it different?

01:15:03.545 --> 01:15:08.410
For him there is to be
no reconciliation.

01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:11.602
It's me...

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.957
It's my mind he wants to break.

01:15:17.726 --> 01:15:20.152
I'm really sorry but I need to rest.

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:23.072
Of course.

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:24.865
- All right?
- Yes.

01:15:24.983 --> 01:15:28.703
Look, you look exhausted.
I think perhaps we've done enough here.

01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:31.455
I think perhaps it's time we left.

01:15:31.573 --> 01:15:33.040
No, really, Phillip.

01:15:33.158 --> 01:15:37.670
As long as everyone joins me to absorb
the emotional energy of the passing.

01:15:37.788 --> 01:15:41.966
I've just seen something in your face
which I thought I'd never see.

01:15:42.084 --> 01:15:44.093
What's that?

01:15:44.211 --> 01:15:46.971
Fear.

01:15:47.089 --> 01:15:52.452
Nevertheless, we have an
obligation to help resolve this.

01:15:52.928 --> 01:15:58.790
All right. Well, I suppose we'd better
talk about it in the morning. Come on.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.281
We are now seeing vigorous...

01:16:05.399 --> 01:16:07.658
- God, it's getting worse.
- ...diplomatic action...

01:16:07.776 --> 01:16:09.869
...to restrain all sides
in the conflict.

01:16:09.987 --> 01:16:12.413
It's like Cuba all over again.

01:16:12.531 --> 01:16:15.374
10 broker a ceasefire
as quickly as possible.

01:16:15.492 --> 01:16:18.461
Who's gonna get us out of it this time?

01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:21.005
Things could be so different.

01:16:21.123 --> 01:16:23.549
...leading to a much wider war.

01:16:23.667 --> 01:16:25.968
Our governments are
just making it worse.

01:16:26.086 --> 01:16:28.763
It's fucking crazy.

01:16:28.881 --> 01:16:33.226
The Bulletin's Doomsday Clack is now
at one minute to midnight.

01:16:33.343 --> 01:16:36.395
Something bad is coming this way.

01:16:36.513 --> 01:16:39.815
God bless everyone
and pray for our world.

01:16:39.933 --> 01:16:43.527
Will we make it through the night?

01:16:43.645 --> 01:16:47.300
Yeah, of course we will.

01:16:48.066 --> 01:16:51.953
We have the Professor and Muriel here.

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:54.538
Yeah, they've done
this sort of thing before.

01:16:54.656 --> 01:16:57.792
No, Tam, not us here
in the house. Everyone.

01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:03.902
Everyone in the world,
will we make it through the night?

01:17:09.713 --> 01:17:13.368
Honestly, Rose...

01:17:14.718 --> 01:17:18.408
I really don't know.

01:18:15.904 --> 01:18:17.163
Oh, God!

01:18:17.281 --> 01:18:21.731
God!

01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:28.216
There's something on
the outside of the door.

01:18:34.173 --> 01:18:37.994
I can't hold this any more!

01:18:39.928 --> 01:18:42.146
It's gone. It's gone.

01:18:48.145 --> 01:18:49.487
Help!

01:18:49.605 --> 01:18:52.365
Get off me!

01:18:55.903 --> 01:18:59.413
What the fuck do you want?
Get the fuck away from us!

01:18:59.531 --> 01:19:03.353
Take me! Fuck you!

01:19:06.038 --> 01:19:08.214
Where is he?

01:19:08.332 --> 01:19:12.051
Huh?

01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:14.470
I'm so sorry.
It's okay. We're gonna leave.

01:19:14.588 --> 01:19:17.223
We're gonna leave.
We're gonna leave now.

01:19:20.219 --> 01:19:22.270
It's okay, it's okay.

01:19:22.387 --> 01:19:24.897
Jesus, what's going on?

01:19:25.015 --> 01:19:27.483
- Harvey, we're leaving.
- Jesus Christ! Rose.

01:19:27.601 --> 01:19:29.902
- Let me out!
- Open the door!

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:34.031
- Let's go.
- Oh, God, Tam! She's not here.

01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:35.241
Muriel!

01:19:35.359 --> 01:19:38.411
Get the Professor! Down here!
Harvey, go straight down.

01:19:38.529 --> 01:19:40.288
Rose! Rose, come with me!

01:19:40.405 --> 01:19:42.665
- Come on, come on!
- Muriel!

01:19:42.783 --> 01:19:44.333
- Straight away.
- Which one?

01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:46.502
- That one there!
- Professor!

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:49.422
- He's not here! He's not here!
- God, they're in the basement!

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.674
Professor!

01:19:51.792 --> 01:19:54.135
Down there! I heard him.

01:19:54.253 --> 01:19:56.470
- Phillip! Phillip!
- Come on!

01:20:00.759 --> 01:20:04.331
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:20:09.017 --> 01:20:12.904
Muriel wasn't in her room. I came
down here, tried to open the door.

01:20:13.021 --> 01:20:16.407
Something hit me, Tam.

01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:19.952
It hit me hard. She's in there.
She's in there!

01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:24.520
Tam, open the door! She's in there!

01:20:25.826 --> 01:20:28.502
Fucking hell, there's something...

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.463
Harvey, push it!

01:20:30.581 --> 01:20:33.049
There's fucking something
on the other side!

01:20:37.921 --> 01:20:41.909
- Fucking move!
- Muriel!

01:20:49.725 --> 01:20:51.901
No, no, no!

01:20:52.019 --> 01:20:54.570
- This is all my fault!
- Please!

01:20:54.688 --> 01:20:56.572
Muriel.

01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:59.533
- Is there anything we can do?
- No! She's gone!

01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:02.787
I'm here! Can you hear me? I'm here!

01:21:02.905 --> 01:21:08.334
She came down here by herself to where
the secret is hidden and buried away.

01:21:08.452 --> 01:21:12.213
To draw him to his shame
and away from me.

01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:13.584
Oh, my God!

01:21:13.585 --> 01:21:17.343
She knew... she knew
what would cost her.

01:21:17.461 --> 01:21:20.596
- We need to get her out.
- Tam, the temperature.

01:21:20.714 --> 01:21:22.848
Tam, the temperature's...

01:21:22.966 --> 01:21:28.200
It's not finished yet!

01:21:28.597 --> 01:21:30.690
- We gotta go!
- Please get her out!

01:21:30.807 --> 01:21:34.485
- Let's get out!
- Let me, let me, let me...

01:21:34.603 --> 01:21:36.821
- Come on, come on.
- I'm coming!

01:21:36.939 --> 01:21:39.282
Harvey!

01:21:39.399 --> 01:21:41.867
Harvey!

01:21:41.985 --> 01:21:44.787
Please!

01:21:44.905 --> 01:21:47.999
Harvey! Harvey!

01:21:48.116 --> 01:21:50.376
We need to leave! Get help!

01:21:50.494 --> 01:21:53.170
- We can't leave him, Professor.
- Get Rose out of here!

01:21:53.288 --> 01:21:57.049
He's after Rose, for God's sake! Go!

01:21:57.167 --> 01:21:59.010
Run, Tam, run!

01:22:06.134 --> 01:22:08.603
Get her out, for God's sake!

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.563
Rose! Rose!

01:22:10.681 --> 01:22:12.440
Get up! Get up!

01:22:19.022 --> 01:22:20.948
Come on! Let's go!

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:22.992
Get in the car!

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:26.370
Get in the car!

01:22:28.407 --> 01:22:30.666
- Get moving!
- It's not starting!

01:22:32.369 --> 01:22:35.087
Oh, God! Can you feel it?
He's coming for me now!

01:22:35.205 --> 01:22:37.673
Professor... there's something
pressing against the window.

01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:41.260
It's the same here. It's pressing
against the window here. It's freezing!

01:22:41.378 --> 01:22:43.262
Drive the car, Tam!

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:46.015
Warning red. Attack warning red.

01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:50.186
Seek cover immediately.
Seek shelter immediately.

01:22:50.304 --> 01:22:53.439
Jesus Christ!

01:22:57.811 --> 01:22:59.278
Oh, Professor!

01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:01.739
Professor... Professor, no!

01:23:01.857 --> 01:23:05.868
- Professor! No! No!
- Is he breathing?

01:23:05.986 --> 01:23:08.955
Uh! Come on, Rosie!
Come on, Rosie, let's go!

01:23:09.072 --> 01:23:11.791
Come on, Rosie! Come on!

01:23:11.909 --> 01:23:13.876
Let's get out!

01:23:15.871 --> 01:23:18.756
There's something in the trees!
There's something in the trees!

01:23:18.874 --> 01:23:20.841
Come on, Rosie!

01:23:20.959 --> 01:23:23.844
- There's something looking at me!
- Come on! Rosie!

01:23:23.962 --> 01:23:26.973
Oh, God!

01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:30.434
Faster! Come on! Come on!

01:24:40.581 --> 01:24:45.301
Such readings seem to suggest
a form of consciousness.

01:24:45.419 --> 01:24:49.013
29/10/16 - question.

01:24:49.131 --> 01:24:53.893
Is there a part of a human being that
can operate outside time and space?

01:24:54.011 --> 01:24:58.814
The natural sciences have long kept
psychical phenomena a dark secret.

01:24:58.932 --> 01:25:01.609
Sidelined, dismissed.

01:25:01.727 --> 01:25:07.156
Mystics, priests have long apprehended
these realms of spirits, ghosts,

01:25:07.274 --> 01:25:09.867
parallel universes.

01:25:09.985 --> 01:25:13.621
And, finally, I, too.

01:25:13.739 --> 01:25:17.875
What we have witnessed these
last few days, fully convinces me

01:25:17.993 --> 01:25:24.507
that we must strive to understand
what human personality truly is.

01:25:24.625 --> 01:25:27.593
Such understanding
may well prove crucial

01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:30.471
to our survival in the 21st century.

01:25:30.589 --> 01:25:33.947
End log.
