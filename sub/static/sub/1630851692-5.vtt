00:52.653 --> 00:54.219
And I had never really brought

this new religion.</i>

01:33.294 --> 01:34.693

01:36.597 --> 01:39.231
[Chantel] I don't believe that
God's gonna send you to hell

01:39.233 --> 01:41.266
- for eating a shrimp, so...
- [woman] I don't think so either.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.802
You eat a bottom-feeder,
you think like a bottom-feeder.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.538
Who are you saying thinks
like a bottom-feeder?

[Jah] We're waiting on you,
Chantel.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.965

02:12.967 --> 02:16.001
South Carolina turned out
to be a pretty good trip

02:16.003 --> 02:19.004
even though Jah was there

02:19.006 --> 02:21.039
<i>and the dynamic of the trip</i>

02:21.041 --> 02:23.041

02:23.043 --> 02:25.911
Learning this stuff
about my family

02:25.913 --> 02:28.180
makes me feel
more connected to them.

02:28.182 --> 02:31.583
This experience has definitely
brought us closer together.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.685
- [woman] Right.
- Let's go.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.220
- [Jah] Let's head out.
- [Winter] Okay.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.122
- I'll open the door.
- [Chantel] All right.

<i>[Winter] Last night's dinner
did not go as planned.</i>

02:43.230 --> 02:45.697
- Oh, my gosh.
- I should have stayed back here at the house.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.734
It was definitely
a stressful situation.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.170
It's like they're
constantly casting

02:51.172 --> 02:54.306
too much judgment, I would say.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.975
- I'mma go to my car, mom.
- [Karen] Okay, then.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.478
[Winter] <i>I should have
communicated better with my family,</i>

02:59.480 --> 03:02.881
but I don't think
that I would have...

03:02.883 --> 03:04.783
I wouldn't change anything,
it was...

03:04.785 --> 03:08.620
it was very refreshing to have
the person that I love

03:08.622 --> 03:11.690
with me during this time.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.894
There was too much energy
back there.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.829
- Too much energy?
- That's right.

03:17.831 --> 03:21.166

- Too much vibrations.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.823
Why is your computer

04:17.825 --> 04:20.492
on the floor by the garbage?

04:22.729 --> 04:25.731
- [Pedro speaking] - [Chantel]
Oh my goodness, Pedro.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.666
That's an entirely new computer.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.202
[Pedro] No!

04:41.247 --> 04:43.048
So you mean to tell me
all that stuff lighting up

04:43.050 --> 04:46.718
and zooming all around
the computer was inside there?

04:46.720 --> 04:49.221
[Pedro speaking]

04:51.257 --> 04:53.392
I leave the house
for just a few days

04:53.394 --> 04:56.295
and this is what happens?

04:56.297 --> 04:59.164
[Pedro speaking]

04:59.166 --> 05:01.900
[Chantel] The trip was good,
but Winter brought Jah.

05:03.269 --> 05:04.670
- [Pedro speaking]
- Yes.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.104
Jah was insulting.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.240
He was calling my mom
a bottom-feeder.

05:08.242 --> 05:10.742
- What?
- Yes.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.077
[Pedro speaking]

05:12.079 --> 05:13.545
[Chantel] Yeah,
everybody got rowdy.

[Pedro speaking]

05:14.748 --> 05:16.448
Everybody. Me, too.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.383
Winter didn't defend her mom,

05:18.385 --> 05:20.252
she doesn't defend herself.

05:20.254 --> 05:24.189
I felt like Jah's
mind-controlling her, like...

05:24.191 --> 05:25.891
[Pedro speaking]

05:25.893 --> 05:27.225
[Chantel] So what's up with you?

06:28.322 --> 06:30.889
[Pedro speaking]

06:34.193 --> 06:36.895
- [Chantel] You told me your father would come...
- [Pedro speaking]

- Would come to see your mom.
- [Pedro speaking]

06:39.533 --> 06:42.901
But you never saw him
because it was at night

06:42.903 --> 06:45.103
- and you were asleep.
- [Pedro speaking]

06:45.105 --> 06:47.739
[Chantel]
I mean, after sometime

06:47.741 --> 06:49.775
you don't think that
she would question him

06:49.777 --> 06:51.843
why he's only coming
at nighttime

06:51.845 --> 06:54.179
and why he doesn't live
with them

06:54.181 --> 06:56.314

with his children?

06:56.316 --> 06:58.850
[Pedro speaking]

07:01.287 --> 07:03.088

07:03.090 --> 07:06.558
that he had another family.

[Pedro speaking]

I'm asking if...
I'm not asking you

07:15.669 --> 07:18.069
at seven years old,
I'm asking you as a grown up.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.538
Have you talked to your mom
about it?

07:19.540 --> 07:21.506
[Pedro speaking]

07:21.508 --> 07:23.308
- [Chantel] Okay.
- [Pedro speaking]

07:23.310 --> 07:26.378
- But you just... Stop attacking me.
- [Pedro speaking]

07:26.380 --> 07:28.313
- I'm just trying to understand...
- [Pedro speaking]

07:28.315 --> 07:29.915
and I'm trying to be here
for you,

07:29.917 --> 07:32.384
and I can tell
that you're hurting.

07:32.386 --> 07:35.754
I know it's a tough
subject amor,

07:35.756 --> 07:39.057
so what's the plan?
What do you wanna do now?

07:39.059 --> 07:41.626
[Pedro speaking]

07:49.902 --> 07:51.336
[Chantel] I wanna be
supportive of you

07:51.338 --> 07:54.072
even if I don't understand.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.142
And I don't know how it feels
to feel the pain

07:57.144 --> 07:59.578
that you feel,
but I want you to know

07:59.580 --> 08:01.313
that I'm here to support you

08:01.315 --> 08:03.582
and if that means
going to the DR with you,

08:03.584 --> 08:05.116
I will do that.

08:06.619 --> 08:09.120
[Pedro speaking]

08:29.309 --> 08:31.977
about your mom
and your dad's dynamic,

08:31.979 --> 08:33.278
- and I'm sorry.
- All right.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.146
We don't have to talk about it.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.560
[Chantel] Even if you don't
want me to go with you

08:48.562 --> 08:51.463
and meet your family
just to have me

08:51.465 --> 08:53.732
waiting for you
in the hotel room

08:53.734 --> 08:56.568
for you to come home

08:56.570 --> 08:59.638

or have dinner together,

08:59.640 --> 09:02.474
it might be comforting to you.

there, I get it,

09:04.878 --> 09:07.445

A cake or something, you know?

17:22.742 --> 17:24.075
[Brandi] I'll be honest, though.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.943
- I don't like icing, so...
- [River] You don't like icing?

17:25.945 --> 17:29.180
No, I just... Cake by itself.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.015
- Oh, okay.
- [Brandi] No, no, I'm just kidding.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.518
- [River] Oh [bleep] oh [bleep]
- Come here, come here.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.053
- [River] Oh, damn.
- [woman laughs]

17:35.055 --> 17:36.521
[Megan] I think that
meeting my friends

17:36.523 --> 17:39.357
is definitely,
kind of, a big deal.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.893
<i>They're protective of myself
and of my son</i>

17:41.895 --> 17:44.462
just because they know
I haven't been dating.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.931
I haven't been bringing people,

17:46.933 --> 17:49.834
you know, around and it shows me

17:49.836 --> 17:51.869
<i>that he's, like, serious
about me for him</i>

17:51.871 --> 17:54.205
<i>to be willing to come
into a house</i>

17:54.207 --> 17:57.108
full of females
ready to just, like,

17:57.110 --> 17:58.776
ask him questions

17:58.778 --> 18:01.612
about his intentions with me.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.082
So River, these
are my closest friends.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.516
- Nice to meet you.
- [Brandi] How do you feel now?

18:05.518 --> 18:07.085
- I feel good.
- [Ashley] Good? Are you sure?

18:07.087 --> 18:08.486
[Brandi] Let me...
Let me just move this out

18:08.488 --> 18:10.455
- of your eyes really quickly.
- Okay.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.657
Like this. Good. All right.
I can see your eyes.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.292
Do you always touch people's
faces...

18:14.294 --> 18:16.060
-I do -[River] ...when
you first meet them?

18:16.062 --> 18:18.129
[Brandi] I do, especially when
I wanna look at their eyes.

18:18.131 --> 18:21.732
- Okay. That's cool.
- [Brandi] Yeah. Yeah.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.601
[Brandi] When I found out
that River was 23

18:23.603 --> 18:25.269
- living at home with mom...
- [Ashley] Yeah. Yeah.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.004
[Brandi] ...I thought,
like, it was crazy.

18:27.006 --> 18:30.274
I wonder sometimes
if being, you know, 23

18:30.276 --> 18:31.943
if you really know
what you want.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.811
Especially with somebody
who's gonna be with somebody

18:33.813 --> 18:36.147
who's 28 with a child.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.816
Are you ready to take
on that challenge?

18:38.818 --> 18:41.018
[Nicole] Feeling a little
uncomfortable?

18:41.020 --> 18:43.121
- [River] No, I feel fine.
- [Nicole] Sweating a little?

18:43.123 --> 18:45.356
- Maybe a little bit...
- [Nicole] Do you want to take your jacket off?

18:45.358 --> 18:47.859
Uh, no, I think
I'll leave it on.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.663
Let's talk about the real stuff.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.232
[River] Okay.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.501
[Brandi] I hear,
like, you just stay at home,

18:56.503 --> 18:59.670
you know kind of, like,
a mama's boy a little bit.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.973
- [Ashley] Damn, Brandi with the...
- I'm just wondering...

19:01.975 --> 19:04.942
I mean, I'm just wondering because
he lives at home with his mom.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.078
[River] Well, okay,
I will say this,

19:07.080 --> 19:10.148
um, my older brother
you know, he came back

19:10.150 --> 19:11.816
to live with us a few times

19:11.818 --> 19:13.684
and that's because he left
the nest too early.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.553
My sister's the same way.
It happened with

19:15.555 --> 19:17.088
- my older siblings.
- Do you feel like you're leaving

19:17.090 --> 19:20.057
the nest too early,
dating someone who's older?

19:20.059 --> 19:22.426
Uh, I feel like we have
a lot... I have a lot more...

19:22.428 --> 19:25.229
Please don't touch
my face again.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.331
All right. I appreciate it.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.901
<i>Megan's friends, I could tell
they were having a lot of fun</i>

19:29.903 --> 19:32.737
trying to pick on me
a little bit,

19:32.739 --> 19:34.172
<i>but I hope they don't judge me,</i>

19:34.174 --> 19:37.508
uh, because I'm a little
younger than everybody.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.243
I hope they just get
to know me as a person.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.845
And I'm gonna come in there
with open arms,

19:40.847 --> 19:44.715
I'm not gonna come in there
like a closed book.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.717
[Megan] They have a lot
of hard questions to ask.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.320
No, it's fine.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.889
[Brandi] Like, what is your
experience in relationships?

19:51.891 --> 19:53.824
[River] In my past, I never
really had a deep connection

19:53.826 --> 19:57.094
with anybody, honestly.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.063
But Megan is different,
like... She's special to me.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.532
But what makes it different
from any other relationship

20:01.534 --> 20:04.468
that you've been in?

20:04.470 --> 20:06.137
And also, like, what's
going to make it to where

20:06.139 --> 20:09.140
you're gonna move out
of your parents' house?

20:09.142 --> 20:10.775
Because, like, honestly,
like, she's not looking

20:10.777 --> 20:13.377
for another kid.

20:13.379 --> 20:17.181
You think I'm a kid?

20:17.183 --> 20:18.916
Are you ready to be a stepdad?

20:27.259 --> 20:28.926
[Brandi] What's gonna make it
to where you're gonna move

20:28.928 --> 20:30.261
out of your parents' house?

20:30.263 --> 20:31.796
Because, like, honestly,
like, she not looking

20:31.798 --> 20:33.464
for another kid.

20:33.466 --> 20:37.468
You think I'm a kid?

20:37.470 --> 20:40.605
So are you ready to be
a stepdad?

20:40.607 --> 20:42.473
[sighs]

20:42.475 --> 20:45.076
I have to ask that
because I'm a single parent,

20:45.078 --> 20:46.711
I have three kids.

20:46.713 --> 20:49.480
So I have to think that
the person that I'm dating

20:49.482 --> 20:52.683
is gonna accept
the entire package.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.654
[River] So Megan
and I talked about it.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.056
She said she doesn't need me
to try

20:59.058 --> 21:00.625
to be a stepdad right now,

21:00.627 --> 21:02.093
you know, we're taking
things very slow.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.961
And we're taking things
very serious, you know?

21:03.963 --> 21:05.730
She's been very transparent
with me.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.131
And that's one reason
why I like her because

21:07.133 --> 21:09.133
she's transparent,
she's true to herself,

21:09.135 --> 21:10.501
and she always is
honest with me.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.771
So you're good with being a
stepdad? You're good with jumping in?

21:13.773 --> 21:16.007
- [Megan] We don't have to answer that yet.
- Really?

21:16.009 --> 21:18.476
We don't have
to answer that yet.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.044
[Nicole] From the get-go,
I need to make sure

21:20.046 --> 21:22.480
- that he's okay.
- No, but we don't, though.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.382
That's where you need to
trust and understand the fact

21:24.384 --> 21:26.550
that I've spoken
to him about this

21:26.552 --> 21:28.719
- and that he and are on the same page.
- But we need to hear about it.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.955
But you don't, though.
Is this your relationship

21:30.957 --> 21:33.557
or is it my relationship?

21:33.559 --> 21:37.361
I really thought that it was
going to be, like, a really relaxed,

21:37.363 --> 21:39.330
chill night where
they just get to meet him

21:39.332 --> 21:41.499
and hang out, and I don't know
what happened.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.268
They just... They just all,
like, it was like a bunch

21:44.270 --> 21:47.204
of like guard dogs, like, argh.

21:47.206 --> 21:50.908
I love the fact that you're
so concerned about me

21:50.910 --> 21:54.045
and my future,
but trust in the fact

21:54.047 --> 21:56.113
that I'm also,
like, a great mother.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.384
[Brandi] Can we just move
to the cake?

22:00.386 --> 22:02.553
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go figure out the cake.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.555
[Nicole] Let's go see
how this cake goes.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.357
With the icing.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.793
[River] Her friends, kind of,
jumped the gun to say,

22:08.795 --> 22:12.263
you know, "Are you ready
to be a stepfather?"

22:12.265 --> 22:14.165
That was not
what it was supposed be about.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.733
This was the time for them
to get to meet me

22:15.735 --> 22:17.902
and I really feel
like they did not get a chance

22:17.904 --> 22:19.403
to meet me.
Like, I feel like,

22:19.405 --> 22:21.572
uh, I was just there
and they were all trying

22:21.574 --> 22:23.674
to pick on me a little bit.

22:23.676 --> 22:24.842
You wanna go check on them?

22:24.844 --> 22:28.779
[Ashley] Okay.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.081
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine,

22:30.083 --> 22:31.849
but your friends are...

22:31.851 --> 22:33.918
They are really,
uh, something, you know?

22:33.920 --> 22:35.786
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.355
- Are you still good?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.489
Yeah?

22:42.060 --> 22:43.928
I'm good. I'm good.
I'm better now, though.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.529
Like, I'm a lot better.
Yeah, like,

22:45.531 --> 22:47.832
honestly, let's go
sit over there again.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.367
I can go through that ten times.

22:49.369 --> 22:50.768
- Ten times is a lot.
- If it ends like this,

22:50.770 --> 22:52.136
I'd go through that
a million times.

22:52.138 --> 22:55.439
- Yeah?
- Hell, yeah.

22:55.441 --> 22:58.242
[River] First kiss right
after, oh.

22:58.244 --> 23:00.611
Megan has really soft lips,

23:00.613 --> 23:03.447
like, I mean, you know,
I didn't...

23:03.449 --> 23:05.783
I wasn't prepared for this,
to be honest with you.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.418
I'm prepared now,
like, you know,

23:07.420 --> 23:09.186
I'm just lost in the sauce
right now, man.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.756
Let me just...
Give me a second, man.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.290
Phew.

23:13.292 --> 23:16.093
I got to hit the road, man.
I got a two-hour drive.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.862
Yeah. It was nice meeting you.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.930
Absolutely.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.333
- I'll walk you to the door.
- Okay. Okay.

23:22.335 --> 23:24.101
- [woman] Thanks, River.
- All right.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.569
All right. Drive safely.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.772
[River] I'll try. I'll try.

23:27.774 --> 23:31.642
[Megan] I'm glad you
were able to come.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.145
- [Megan] I'm gonna say that was
your... [mumbling] - [River] All right.

23:34.147 --> 23:35.813
[Megan] It means a lot to me
that he was willing

23:35.815 --> 23:37.948
to drive and come meet
my friends because obviously

23:37.950 --> 23:39.984
it shows that, like,
I'm important for him.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.852
[Megan] Oh, my God.

23:41.854 --> 23:45.256
But my friends are definitely
concerned about him

23:45.258 --> 23:46.924
still, like, staying
with his parents.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.125
I didn't really think much
about it

23:48.127 --> 23:51.362
until my friends brought it up.

23:51.364 --> 23:52.430
It does make me wonder like,

23:52.432 --> 23:53.864
"Well, what are
the next steps?"

23:53.866 --> 23:57.067
Like, when do you think
you want to move out

23:57.069 --> 23:58.669
and like, you know,
be on your own,

23:58.671 --> 24:02.440
like, kind of, um, grow
that independence, really?

24:05.243 --> 24:07.845
[River] Through the distance
and friends grilling me,

24:07.847 --> 24:10.614
I still find myself,
like, uh, falling

24:10.616 --> 24:13.050
for Megan every time
I talk to her.

24:13.052 --> 24:16.187
So I feel like her
meeting my family is a...

24:16.189 --> 24:18.556
is a logical next step.
I mean, I'm still,

24:18.558 --> 24:21.091
kind of, like on the fence
about the whole thing.

24:21.093 --> 24:24.161
My family, uh, the track record

24:24.163 --> 24:26.163
is not too good, man, you know?

24:26.165 --> 24:29.633
So it leads me
to worry a little bit.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.735
All right. Be careful.

24:31.737 --> 24:32.870
All right.

24:36.241 --> 24:40.010
[upbeat music playing]

24:48.687 --> 24:51.455
<i>[Alejandro] Today, I'm
visiting my aunt Alejandra.</i>

24:51.457 --> 24:54.291
She's one of my closest aunt
here in New York.

24:59.197 --> 25:02.733
I want to talk to her
about all the events

25:02.735 --> 25:06.370
that has happened lately,
uh, with me,

25:06.372 --> 25:08.372
and Nicole, and her family.

25:08.374 --> 25:09.540
[in Spanish]

25:09.542 --> 25:11.041

[in Spanish]

26:06.364 --> 26:08.799
[in Spanish]

26:10.869 --> 26:14.471
[Alejandro] I think, like, I
wasn't to supposed to say that.

26:14.473 --> 26:17.675
I wasn't supposed to respond
back to the girl,

26:17.677 --> 26:20.544
but it was a mistake
that I made.

26:24.249 --> 26:27.051
<i>I apologized to her for that
but, like,</i>

26:27.053 --> 26:30.521
Nicole was overreacting.

26:30.523 --> 26:32.790
<i>Okay, there are certain
things that we can work out,</i>

26:32.792 --> 26:35.492
but the problem with her
family... I don't know.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.227
I don't think it can be fixed.

to talk to Nicole.</i>

29:00.039 --> 29:02.206
I really need her

29:02.208 --> 29:05.976
to let me explain
my side of the story.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.579
<i>I know what I did
and I apologized to her</i>

29:08.581 --> 29:10.981
many times.
I really see a future

29:10.983 --> 29:14.151
with Nicole,
um, as long as she wants to.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.754
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

29:16.756 --> 29:18.222
this family is crazy,

29:18.224 --> 29:21.258
this family is very toxic

29:21.260 --> 29:23.393
and dysfunctional.

29:23.395 --> 29:25.229
<i>I really want to be with her,</i>

29:25.231 --> 29:28.365

<i>with that married man
who already has a family?</i>

29:50.790 --> 29:52.422
[Chantel] Like, what did
she think? Did she think

29:52.424 --> 29:54.224
he was working all day
and came home late at night?

29:54.226 --> 29:55.993
I don't know.

30:23.288 --> 30:24.321
[Chantel] Hey.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.357
Hi.

30:27.359 --> 30:28.525
[Karen] Thank you for coming.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.494
Look at all this great stuff.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.696
[Chantel] This Christmas
store has everything we need.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.565
Yes, it does.

30:34.567 --> 30:37.067
<i>It's been a few days since
we've gotten back</i>

30:37.069 --> 30:38.502
<i>from South Carolina.</i>

30:38.504 --> 30:40.971
[Chantel] And the two of us
are going

30:40.973 --> 30:42.639
ornament shopping today.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.608
And we're getting ready
for a holiday gathering.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.910
- Not a Christmas party.
- Mmm-mmm.

30:46.912 --> 30:50.347
We're making the distinction
to say

30:50.349 --> 30:53.550
that we are having a holiday
party out of respect

30:53.552 --> 30:57.554
for Winter and Jah,
who's welcomed.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.557
<i>Even though we have different
beliefs,</i>

31:00.559 --> 31:03.927
all are welcome.

31:03.929 --> 31:07.064
[Chantel] You have to have
little elves.

31:07.066 --> 31:10.167
[Karen] Oh, little elves,
that reminds me of Pedro.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.568
Oh, my gosh, look at that.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.737
- [Chantel] Why?
- [Karen laughs]

31:13.739 --> 31:16.406
It's, like, "Hola.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.975
Hola, Karen."

31:17.977 --> 31:20.210
That's your little...
[in Spanish]

31:20.212 --> 31:22.246
Why does it remind you of Pedro?

31:22.248 --> 31:24.181
- It just does.
- [Chantel] Which one?

31:24.183 --> 31:25.549
Both of them.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.252
[Chantel] Okay.

31:28.254 --> 31:31.054
So Pedro told me the other day

31:31.056 --> 31:33.724
that he wants to go to the DR

31:33.726 --> 31:36.927
because he's looking
for his father.

31:36.929 --> 31:39.930
He met his cousin in New York

31:39.932 --> 31:43.467
and he wants to meet
that side of his family.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.135
I think that's good, Chantel.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.471
I hope he finds his father,
that's important.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.873
Uh, of course, yeah.
I think for sure,

31:49.875 --> 31:52.409
absolutely he needs to
go and find out

31:52.411 --> 31:54.411
about his dad's side
of the family.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.114
But it's really bewildering
to me,

31:57.116 --> 31:58.749
like, I can't fathom that her...

31:58.751 --> 32:00.984
His mom wouldn't have
told him anything.

32:00.986 --> 32:04.121
You know, he's 29 years old now.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.956
Here we are in adulthood

32:05.958 --> 32:08.625
and you still
haven't had a conversation

32:08.627 --> 32:10.160
with your mom about your dad.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.828
[Karen] Maybe he was afraid,

32:11.830 --> 32:13.797
you know, he was scared.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.299
You need to make Pedro
understand

32:15.301 --> 32:17.034
that he has nothing to be
ashamed of.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.569
[Chantel] Well, he thinks that
I'm trying to judge him.

32:19.571 --> 32:20.938
I asked him a question

32:20.940 --> 32:23.607
and he got really defensive
about it.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.542
[Karen] And that question was?

32:25.544 --> 32:28.245
Did your mom know

32:28.247 --> 32:30.781
that your dad
had another family?

32:33.251 --> 32:35.218
I just wanted to know
and he thinks that

32:35.220 --> 32:37.287
- I was trying to...
- [Karen] Insult her?

32:37.289 --> 32:39.189
Insult her.

32:39.191 --> 32:42.693
[Chantel]
Pedro told me that he...

32:42.695 --> 32:44.261
never spent time with his dad.

32:44.263 --> 32:47.130
His dad only came at night
when he was asleep.

32:47.132 --> 32:50.033
He said that every time
in the night

32:50.035 --> 32:52.502
when his dad came,
his mom put him to bed.

32:52.504 --> 32:55.973
But I was wondering
if maybe Lidia

32:55.975 --> 33:00.010
had a sense that
he was messing around on her

33:00.012 --> 33:01.845
and going to somewhere else...
Like, what did she think?

33:01.847 --> 33:03.313
Did she think
he was working all day

33:03.315 --> 33:05.315
and came home late at night?
I don't know.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.685
Like, I just wanted to know,
like, what did she think

33:08.687 --> 33:11.288
or when did she realize that

33:11.290 --> 33:13.890
he had another family?

33:13.892 --> 33:16.293
I wasn't trying
to disrespect his mother

33:16.295 --> 33:18.495
in front of him.
But I guess,

33:18.497 --> 33:20.697
since I had in the past,
he thought that I was trying

33:20.699 --> 33:23.867
to, um, like, come for her
or something

33:23.869 --> 33:26.136
but I really just wanted
to know.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.838
[Karen] Listen, all I can say
is I don't know anything

33:27.840 --> 33:30.374
about their business,
but if his mother chose

33:30.376 --> 33:33.043
to be involved
with a married man...

33:33.045 --> 33:35.512
Create a family
with that married man

33:35.514 --> 33:37.381
- who already has a family...
- Well, I don't know

33:37.383 --> 33:40.117
if she did it by choice or not.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.786
[Karen] It was an accident?
That right there,

33:42.788 --> 33:47.024
that is none of my business,
really.

33:47.026 --> 33:48.925
And I'm not talking
about anybody,

33:48.927 --> 33:51.094
I'm just talking about
what I'm talking about.

33:51.096 --> 33:54.765
When you asked Pedro
if his mother knew

33:54.767 --> 33:57.534
that that man
was already married

33:57.536 --> 33:59.770
and had a whole family
over there

33:59.772 --> 34:02.873
when she decided to have
a relationship with him

34:02.875 --> 34:05.208
- and make one child...
- He got upset.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.612
And then after a few...
a few years later,

34:08.614 --> 34:11.348
that married man
with family over there

34:11.350 --> 34:13.350
then have another child?

34:13.352 --> 34:16.620
That's confusing
for a young child.

34:16.622 --> 34:19.456
That's painful and I really,
really hope

34:19.458 --> 34:22.125
Pedro finds the answers
he's looking for.

34:22.127 --> 34:24.127
You know what,
just... I think you need

34:24.129 --> 34:27.030
- to support him. I think...
- [Chantel] And I don't know how.

34:27.032 --> 34:30.167
[Karen] Support him
in that you'll just,

34:30.169 --> 34:32.869
um, support his decision.

34:32.871 --> 34:37.174
And this time
just, you know, stay aback.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.109
[Chantel] It really brings
Pedro a lot of pain

34:39.111 --> 34:41.545
and I felt really bad about it.

34:41.547 --> 34:44.214
Yeah, my heart goes out to him,
I really hope he finds his father,

34:44.216 --> 34:46.450
I hope he finds
what he's looking for.

34:46.452 --> 34:48.919
But I think he's making the...
He's taking a step

34:48.921 --> 34:51.188
in the right direction
right now.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.790
[sighs]

34:55.660 --> 34:58.195
[Alejandro in Spanish]

35:01.466 --> 35:03.400
The problem with her family,
I don't know,

35:03.402 --> 35:05.102
uh, I don't think
it can be fixed.

[in Spanish]

35:12.910 --> 35:14.744
[soft music playing]

35:20.751 --> 35:23.520
I totally regret to meet up
with Pedro

35:23.522 --> 35:25.922
because he's an [bleep].

35:25.924 --> 35:27.224
He took me out of my character

35:27.226 --> 35:29.292
and, uh, I really didn't
want to fight

35:29.294 --> 35:31.561
but there was no other option

35:31.563 --> 35:34.731
in that case, I think.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.934
I want to make amends
with Nicole,

35:37.936 --> 35:39.536
I really love her.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.405
And maybe I did something wrong,

35:42.407 --> 35:44.975
something that she didn't like.

35:44.977 --> 35:46.643
<i>But I didn't [bleep] on her.</i>

35:46.645 --> 35:48.011
This was a misunderstanding,
this was...

35:48.013 --> 35:50.413
this was a misinterpretation.

35:50.415 --> 35:53.984
And I would like her
to give me a chance.

be able

Will you marry me?
