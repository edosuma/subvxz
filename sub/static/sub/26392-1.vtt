[dramatic music plays over TV]

00:06.180 --> 00:08.312
What?! No!No, no, no! No, come on!

00:08.356 --> 00:11.228
They didn't even tell us
who murdered the queen!Ugh.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.925
You know what?
It's all good.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.753
The next episode
starts in ten seconds.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.103
Yes. [chuckles]

00:16.146 --> 00:17.887
[sighs]

00:17.930 --> 00:19.845
You know, should we
watch this next episode,

00:19.889 --> 00:22.587
or should we do what we
normally do on Saturday nights?

00:23.806 --> 00:26.156
Unload the dishwasher?

00:26.200 --> 00:28.854
Why would I use my
sexy voice for that?

00:28.898 --> 00:32.032
I'm talking about,
you know... [grunts]

00:32.075 --> 00:34.425
Oh. Ooh. [laughs]

00:34.469 --> 00:35.557
Yeah, let's do that.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.734
All right.
[chuckles]

00:38.777 --> 00:40.301
[dramatic music plays over TV]

00:40.344 --> 00:43.217
Or we could just watch
one more episode.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.480
Ah. God, I love you.

00:45.523 --> 00:47.308
I love you, too.

00:47.351 --> 00:50.311
[sighs] Nope.
We should just do it now,

00:50.354 --> 00:52.617
or it's never gonna happen.Totally agree.
Totally agree.

00:52.661 --> 00:55.620
You know what? I'm gonna
go, uh, wolf down

00:55.664 --> 00:58.319
a piece of that garlic bread so
it's not just on your breath.

01:01.365 --> 01:04.368
Maybe take a bite
of a deviled egg, too.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.588
JAMES CORDEN [over TV]:
...is calling it quits...

01:06.631 --> 01:09.547
Wait, Jake, look, they're
talking about your client on TV.

01:09.591 --> 01:13.638
Big news today, multi-platinum
Australian singer Cooper James

01:13.682 --> 01:16.989
has split with his movie star
flame Sierra Quinn.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.644
[audience groans] I know. It's such a shame

01:19.688 --> 01:21.994
because we all thought
that relationship

01:22.038 --> 01:25.302
could have lasted
well into next week.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.304
Is this gonna affect you?

01:27.348 --> 01:28.610
No, I'm just
Cooper's accountant.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.960
You know what we need
is some tunes.

01:31.003 --> 01:33.832

raped and murdered her mother.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.236
Shut up, Alexa!

01:46.280 --> 01:47.629

01:52.329 --> 01:54.157
Hi. Is this Jake's house?

01:54.201 --> 01:56.072
Ooh.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.378
That's Cooper James.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.510
Why-why is, why is
Cooper James at our door?

01:59.554 --> 02:01.904
Um... uh...

02:03.384 --> 02:06.213
Cooper James, hi. It is
so nice to meet you.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.866
You must be Claire.Hi.

02:07.910 --> 02:10.869
Ooh, another one.
Oh. [laughs] A third.

02:10.913 --> 02:13.133
I should've taken
a Dramamine.

02:13.176 --> 02:15.657
Sorry. Sorry to barge in
on you like this, Jake,

02:15.700 --> 02:17.354
but I'm having a bit
of an emergency.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.703
Ooh, an accounting emergency.

02:18.747 --> 02:21.141
I've been waiting
my whole life for this.

02:21.184 --> 02:23.360
No, the, uh... the paparazzi
are after me since this breakup,

02:23.404 --> 02:25.667
and I need a safe place to hide,
so I thought,

02:25.710 --> 02:27.147
who is an ordinary guy

02:27.190 --> 02:28.887
living an ordinary life
in a totally ordinary place...

02:28.931 --> 02:31.325
Feel free to stop
saying "ordinary."

02:31.368 --> 02:33.936
I, uh... Is it at all possible
that I crash here

02:33.979 --> 02:35.198
till this all dies down?

02:35.242 --> 02:38.070
Oh, uh...Oh. Uh... [laughs]

02:38.114 --> 02:39.463
Wait, I wasn't interrupting
anything, was I?

02:39.507 --> 02:41.030
No.
No.

02:41.073 --> 02:43.032
No, we were just
sitting watching TV.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.077
Yeah, just TV and...And eating Chex Mix.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.428

["Pony" by Ginuwine playing]

02:57.612 --> 03:00.049
â™ª

03:07.709 --> 03:10.233
So, I talked to Cooper's
manager, and, uh,

03:10.277 --> 03:12.496
Wayne thinks this will all
blow over in a couple of weeks.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.890
Jake, we're not cool enough

03:14.933 --> 03:17.066
to host a guy like Cooper
for that long.

03:17.109 --> 03:19.634
Look at the reminders
popping up on his phone.

03:19.677 --> 03:21.244
Okay?

03:21.288 --> 03:23.420
"Studio session with Rihanna."

03:23.464 --> 03:24.900

03:24.943 --> 03:26.641
"Dinner at The Met.

03:30.601 --> 03:34.083
We have scented candles, and
this kid is becoming a candle.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.650
Claire-bear. [chuckles]

03:35.693 --> 03:38.479
My nickname in college
was "Dr. Dunk." Okay?

03:38.522 --> 03:43.571
You once got pulled up on
stage by Sir Dave Matthews.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.573
It's not like
we're new to the game.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.183
I don't think anyone calls it
"the game" anymore.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.272
Trust me, babe, the key
to handling famous people

03:49.316 --> 03:50.795
is just to not try that hard.

03:51.796 --> 03:55.278
Coop-burger!

03:55.322 --> 03:57.411
How'd you schnooze?

03:57.454 --> 03:59.195
Great. Hey, I hope
you don't mind,

03:59.239 --> 04:00.588
but I didn't bring
any, uh, clothes,

04:00.631 --> 04:01.806
so I just grabbed a couple
things from your closet.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.898
Those are from my closet.

04:06.942 --> 04:10.902
And they look amazing on you.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.382
[laughing]:
They do.

04:12.426 --> 04:15.298
So, uh, do you guys mind
if I hang out with you today?

04:15.342 --> 04:17.866
Aren't you going fly-fishing
with Jaden Smith?

04:19.476 --> 04:21.609
I'm just loving
how simple things are here.

04:21.652 --> 04:24.046
Life with Sierra
was always so fancy, but...

04:24.089 --> 04:26.091
you guys literally put
an "eat" sign on the wall

04:26.135 --> 04:27.832
'cause that's what you do
in a kitchen.

04:29.094 --> 04:32.533
Yeah, picked that
bad boy up from Costco.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.665
It's a private store, but, uh,
I can get you on the list.

04:36.188 --> 04:39.061
Yeah. Yeah, being here is
reminding me so much of my life

04:39.104 --> 04:40.323
before all this craziness.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.368
You know,
when I was in Australia,

04:41.411 --> 04:42.369
living with my parents.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.981
[laughing]: Parents.[laughs]

04:46.024 --> 04:48.679
Oh.
Oh.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.072
CLAIRE:
You're not kidding.

04:50.115 --> 04:52.727
Um, we're only, like,
ten years older than you.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.163
Don't mind her, dude.

04:54.206 --> 04:55.251
She's new to the game.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.210
What game?

04:58.254 --> 05:00.343
Hey, man, you want to goose
some 'stree with me?

05:00.387 --> 05:02.780
Some 'stree.
You want to goose it?

05:02.824 --> 05:06.480
He's-he's offering you a pastry
in a very weird voice.

05:07.655 --> 05:10.353
You are so lucky you get
to eat whatever you want.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.443
Oh, my God.
Right?

05:13.487 --> 05:15.663
Oh, my God.
Yup.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.534
Claire!

05:17.578 --> 05:20.711
This is the best thing ever.

05:20.755 --> 05:22.452
What would
someone call this?

05:22.496 --> 05:25.977
Someone would call that
a Toaster Strudel.

05:27.109 --> 05:29.503
You've got to give
me the recipe.
Oh.

05:29.546 --> 05:34.029
Oh, it's easy: you just put it
in a toaster, and you hit down.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.858
Amazing. So, uh,
what are you up to?

05:36.901 --> 05:39.861
Oh, I'm just syncing up Jake and
my work calendars for the week.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.211
I, uh, design
restaurants and bars.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.995
That's so cool.
Any places I would know?

05:44.039 --> 05:47.477
Oh, uh, well, the last place
was this French restaurant

05:47.521 --> 05:48.957
called Le Jardin Bleu.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.567
Are you serious?

05:52.221 --> 05:54.919
That is literally my
favorite restaurant.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.444
Really?
Mm-hmm.

05:57.487 --> 06:00.360
Yeah, yeah, I eat there
every time I'm in Morocco.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.406
Oh. [chuckles]

06:03.450 --> 06:08.106
Um, well, I designed the one
that is in the Best Buy Mall,

06:08.150 --> 06:13.285
um, just north of Oxnard.

06:13.329 --> 06:16.550
Well, I can't wait
to try it someday.

06:16.593 --> 06:19.248
What's "Saturday night
course work"?

06:19.291 --> 06:22.425
[groans]

06:22.469 --> 06:23.905
What?

06:23.948 --> 06:26.037
What?What's "Saturday night
course work"?

06:26.081 --> 06:27.169
What's what-what-what-what?

06:28.257 --> 06:30.564
"Saturday night
course work."

06:30.607 --> 06:32.914
[sighs] All right,
look, man.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.264
So, my assistant has access
to our calendar, right?Mm-hmm.

06:35.307 --> 06:38.833
So "course" is short
for "intercourse."

06:38.876 --> 06:40.530
What?

06:40.574 --> 06:42.924
Intercourse. [chuckles]
What?

06:42.967 --> 06:45.927
Making sex!

06:45.970 --> 06:47.668
Yeah, we put it in the
calendar so we don't go

06:47.711 --> 06:48.756
more than a week
without having it.

06:48.799 --> 06:49.931
Ah.
Yeah.

06:49.974 --> 06:51.411
Well, I guess I can relate.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.673
Yeah, with Sierra, we often
had to schedule breaks

06:52.716 --> 06:56.198
in our sex life...
Right.

06:56.241 --> 06:58.287
...because we were
having so much of it.Right, right.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.463
And, um, I developed
a condition

07:00.507 --> 07:02.552
my doctors identified
as "stud pole."

07:02.596 --> 07:04.815
Mm. "Stud pole."

07:04.859 --> 07:06.687
Or, as I like to
call it, "college."

07:06.730 --> 07:08.428
[laughs]

07:08.471 --> 07:10.778
Okay. He dated one
girl the whole time,

07:10.821 --> 07:12.823
and you're looking at her.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.826
Hey, I was, uh,
actually gonna sneak away

07:15.870 --> 07:18.263
to a private club tonight
if you guys wanted to join?

07:18.307 --> 07:20.004
Oh.
Ooh.
But I-- ooh, no, I see

07:20.048 --> 07:21.963
you've got a couples massage
booked today.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.965
Oh, no. That's, uh--
I think you misread that.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.619
That's "couples message."

07:25.662 --> 07:27.359
Yeah, um...
[laughs]

07:27.403 --> 07:29.710
Jake and I are kind of famous
with our friends for recording

07:29.753 --> 07:31.625
silly outgoing messages
on our landline.

07:31.668 --> 07:35.367
Yeah, we absolutely
crushed our last one.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.500
Hit him with a taste, C-Train.No, I don't think...

07:37.544 --> 07:40.634
Come on, girl.â™ª Hey, when you get

07:40.677 --> 07:44.594
â™ª To the end of the tone

07:44.638 --> 07:48.424
â™ª Please leave a message

â™ª Hey, girl

07:56.693 --> 08:00.610
â™ª I'm so sad to miss your sweet,
sweet voice, but, uh â™ª

08:00.654 --> 08:03.744
â™ª Why don't you lay down a
smooth track with your deets â™ª

08:03.787 --> 08:07.835
â™ª And, uh, I'll get back

08:07.878 --> 08:08.966
BOTH:
â™ª A'ight?

08:09.010 --> 08:11.055
[both laugh]

08:11.099 --> 08:13.362
It's so g...
It's so great.

08:13.405 --> 08:15.016
I can't...

08:15.059 --> 08:16.844
[laughter fading]

08:16.887 --> 08:19.847
Ah...
[clears throat]
Ah...

08:19.890 --> 08:23.546
Cooper, we would love to
come out with you tonight.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.897
[dance music playing]

08:26.941 --> 08:28.899
Whoa.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.249
Oh, my God.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.426
This place is incredible.

08:35.558 --> 08:38.213
Guys, this is
my security guard, Nightmare.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.693
Ha-ha! Nightmare.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.695
What up, player?
[chuckles]

08:41.738 --> 08:43.827
Yeah.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.829
Okay, Jake, are we
too lame to be here?

08:45.873 --> 08:47.701
No.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.576
Yes!

08:53.620 --> 08:56.187
How am I doing?

08:56.231 --> 08:58.450
Uh, maybe try using
your upper body, too.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.715
It's lovely you're having fun.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.107
Shots!

09:05.849 --> 09:07.155
Ooh.

09:07.198 --> 09:10.506
Yeah! Yeah!

09:10.550 --> 09:12.247
Best Sunday night ever!

09:12.290 --> 09:13.553
Yeah!
Yeah!

09:14.728 --> 09:18.035
[retches, coughs]

09:18.079 --> 09:20.777
Nightmare!

09:24.607 --> 09:27.436
Next time.

09:30.961 --> 09:32.920
Jake?

09:32.963 --> 09:34.486
Jake!

09:34.530 --> 09:37.925
Yeah, I'll slam
another Bud Light Lime.

09:37.968 --> 09:41.624
What happened last night?

09:41.668 --> 09:45.323
Well, I know
we came home to get it on...

09:46.803 --> 09:48.936
...uh, but you wanted
to grab a quick snack,

09:48.979 --> 09:52.635
and I went upstairs to change
into a sexier outfit.

09:52.679 --> 09:53.941
And then did we get it on?

09:53.984 --> 09:56.944
I don't think so.Oh.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.469
Ugh, I am so hungover.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.732
There is no way
that I could go to work today.

10:02.776 --> 10:06.649
And I am so sore from
all that dancing.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.129
Holy crap, it's
Rylie Connors.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.871
Ugh, yeah, it's just
some fluff piece.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.961
But man, look at her butt.
I just want to bite it.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.790
[growling noises]

10:16.833 --> 10:19.401
Hi.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.925
Hi. This is my friend Rylie.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.014
Rylie, this is, uh,
Jake and Claire Davis.

10:24.058 --> 10:26.582
You have a very nice home,
Mr. and Mrs. Davis.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.931
[laughs]"Mrs. Davis"?

10:27.975 --> 10:29.280
[laughs]What do you think...

10:31.718 --> 10:36.418
Rylie! Rylie, I mean, come on.
Girl child.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.117
Jake and I
are just like you guys.

10:40.161 --> 10:43.512
We're young and fun
and... full of beans.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.558
"Mr. Davis" makes me
sound like some sort of

10:46.602 --> 10:48.604
old man, which I am not.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.562
[groans]

10:50.606 --> 10:53.696
[strained]:
Oh, I got it. I got it.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.045
Last night was so crazy.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.787
Um, are you...
are you not hungover?

10:57.831 --> 10:58.875
Oh, I just decided years ago

10:58.919 --> 11:00.442
to never let alcohol
make me hungover.

11:00.485 --> 11:01.878
Dude, same.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.187
Uh, Claire-bear, could
you do me a quick slice

11:06.230 --> 11:07.362
and tilt this baby back up?

11:07.405 --> 11:09.407
Thank you.
[chuckles]

11:10.408 --> 11:11.714
Anyway, we've been
out all night,

11:11.758 --> 11:13.368
so, uh, we're gonna
go to bed.

11:13.411 --> 11:14.935
Good night, Mr. and Mrs. Davis.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.197
CLAIRE:
Okay.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.287
We're barely older than you.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.289
Baby, you passed out
in your cereal.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.725
[groans]

11:25.597 --> 11:27.861
[alarm beeping]

11:27.904 --> 11:30.037
Look, someone secretly
took photos of me

11:30.080 --> 11:31.691
dancing with Cooper
at that nightclub.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.128
[exhales] "Cooper James
seems to have traded in

11:34.171 --> 11:36.173
"his 19-year-old
Lamborghini Sierra

11:36.217 --> 11:38.959
for what appears to be
a 40-year-old cargo van."

11:39.002 --> 11:42.353
What the hell? They cropped
me out of the picture.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.877
Our phones are blowing up.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.835
Everyone we know thinks I'm
having an affair with Cooper.

11:45.879 --> 11:48.229
[phone vibrating]Oh, here's one from my dad.

11:48.272 --> 11:51.319
"I told you, if you stopped
working out, you'd lose her."

11:51.362 --> 11:52.581
[mutters]

11:52.624 --> 11:53.930
Jake, this is so embarrassing.

11:53.974 --> 11:56.367
Now my boss knows
that I lied about being sick,

11:56.411 --> 11:58.500
and everyone else thinks
that I'm an adulterer.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.284
Do you think you're overreacting
just a little?

12:00.328 --> 12:01.895
[crying]:
I don't think so.

12:01.938 --> 12:04.419
Look at this e-mail
I just got from our pastor.

12:04.462 --> 12:05.986
"Can you get me concert tickets,

12:06.029 --> 12:09.293
or was this a
'hit it and quit it' situation?"

12:12.949 --> 12:14.429
Aw, look.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.692
Us Weeklyis calling
Cooper's mystery girl

12:16.736 --> 12:20.043
"an inspiration
to bland women everywhere."

12:20.783 --> 12:22.045
Claire! Claire!Claire!

12:22.089 --> 12:23.264
GERALD: Jake! Jake!BONNIE: Jake!

12:23.307 --> 12:25.832
Mom, Dad, what-what
are you doing here?

12:25.875 --> 12:27.703
I was making smoothies
for us this morning,

12:27.747 --> 12:30.924
and I realized I didn't
have enough vodka, so...

12:30.967 --> 12:33.187
so I ran out
to the store

12:33.230 --> 12:36.190
to get another case,
and I see this.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.192
My daughter cheating
on her husband

12:38.235 --> 12:40.629
with the singer
of my favorite workout music.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.239
How could you do this?

12:42.283 --> 12:45.677
Claire, you've ruined
Zumba for me.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.377
Jake, I hate that this
has happened to you.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.552
Look, you're a good guy,
and I think

12:50.595 --> 12:52.815
I speak for both
Bonnie and me when I say

12:52.859 --> 12:54.643
take care and good luck.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.210
Thanks for everything.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.602
CLAIRE:
Okay, guys, stop.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.387
I am not having
an affair with Cooper.

12:59.430 --> 13:02.433
He is Jake's client,
and he is just staying with us.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.826
Morning, guys.
Oh!

13:03.870 --> 13:07.177
Hey. H-Hey. Whoa.[screaming]

13:07.221 --> 13:09.223
CLAIRE:
Okay.

13:09.266 --> 13:12.226
Cooper, I'm sorry.
These are my parents.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.271
Okay. It's so lovely
to meet you.

13:14.315 --> 13:17.405
Oh. Oh, that's-- oh.
Ha! Ho, ho!

13:17.448 --> 13:19.799
How about one in the middle?
Balance it out.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.018
Hey, why don't we park
ourselves in the living room

13:22.062 --> 13:23.890
and get to know each other
over a glass of lemonade?

13:23.933 --> 13:26.718
No. This our home. You can't
just loiter here all day.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.633
Ooh![soft laughter]

13:28.677 --> 13:30.810
Now, who has a lemon?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.855
All right, I know you guys
are doctors and everything,

13:32.899 --> 13:34.857
but is it possible that
you're drinking too much?

13:34.901 --> 13:37.512
[babbling gibberish]

13:38.861 --> 13:41.646
Jake, everyone knows
that you can't be an alcoholic

13:41.690 --> 13:42.865
if you're retired.

13:42.909 --> 13:43.866
Oh.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.479
[whimpers]:
Oh. Jake.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.481
I am tired and hungover,

13:50.525 --> 13:54.007
and I am currently the most
famous cougar on the planet.

13:54.050 --> 13:57.575
And now my parents are going
to never stop coming over.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.055
Yeah, you're right.
This is too much.

13:59.099 --> 14:01.362
We have to find a way
to get Cooper out of our house.

14:09.196 --> 14:12.242
Hey, congratulations,
Jake. [chuckles]

14:12.286 --> 14:14.027
If you're gonna get cheated
on, at least it's with

14:14.070 --> 14:15.724
a celebrity you can brag about.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.900
How may I help you, Wayne?

14:17.944 --> 14:20.729
I booked Cooper and Sierra
a lucrative photo spread

14:20.772 --> 14:22.339
in Liquid Magazine.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.907
Sierra loves the idea, but
Cooper's not answering my calls.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.996
I'm his manager, Jake.
He should be taking my calls.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.216
Well, yeah, but I think
he's trying to, you know,

14:29.259 --> 14:31.174
take a break from all
that craziness, you know?

14:31.218 --> 14:34.047
Sure. But I'm just gonna text
you Sierra's number

14:34.090 --> 14:35.526
while you think about this.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.398
As soon as he moves
back in with her,

14:37.441 --> 14:40.053
you'll get your house back
to start repairing things

14:40.096 --> 14:41.881
with the lady
Us Weeklyis calling

14:41.924 --> 14:45.275
"the hottest regular woman
in greater Encino."

14:49.976 --> 14:52.500
â™ª

14:52.543 --> 14:53.675
[doorbell rings]

14:53.718 --> 14:55.546
Oh, who could that be?

14:58.941 --> 15:01.683
Sierra Quinn.
What a surprise.

15:02.858 --> 15:05.078
You must be Jake and Chloe.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.818
Well, uh, my name's Claire.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.385
Pass.

15:08.429 --> 15:11.258
Sierra, what-what
are you doing here?

15:11.301 --> 15:12.781
I just came to say

15:12.824 --> 15:14.914
that I'm willing to let
pylons be pylons.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.439
We're too big a brand
to let some old lady

15:18.482 --> 15:20.093
with her original teeth
come between us.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.095
No offense, Corky.

15:22.138 --> 15:25.272
That's not even
close to "Claire."

15:25.315 --> 15:28.449
I don't know, every time we
have the smallest argument,

15:28.492 --> 15:29.754
you get so dramatic.

15:29.798 --> 15:32.975
You saying that makes me
want to kill myself.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.109
Jake, are we sure that
this is a good idea?

15:36.152 --> 15:39.112
'Cause this girl seems
pretty... horrendous.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.070
No...

15:41.114 --> 15:43.116
It's just that these two
have taught me that passion

15:43.159 --> 15:45.292
doesn't have to be the driving
force in a relationship.

15:47.076 --> 15:50.471
Sometimes it's better to have a
pal that you can sleep next to,

15:50.514 --> 15:52.168
like two old friends
sharing a hotel room

15:52.212 --> 15:53.561
that accidentally
came with one bed.

15:53.604 --> 15:54.997
Nah.
Okay!

15:55.041 --> 15:56.433
Obviously,

15:56.477 --> 15:58.740
you two have some stuff
to figure out,

15:58.783 --> 16:02.178
but it would be a shame to
give up on something this good.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.312
That old lady
does have a point.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.358
That's nice, but...

16:08.402 --> 16:10.665
I'm kind of enjoying
my life here.

16:10.708 --> 16:13.711
Yeah, I-I'm sure, but obviously
this can't be permanent.

16:13.755 --> 16:16.236
You know, I mean,
you're way too young and cool

16:16.279 --> 16:18.412
to be sitting around
on a couch eating popcorn

16:18.455 --> 16:19.848
with some lame
married couple.

16:19.891 --> 16:22.242
[gives a silly laugh]

16:22.285 --> 16:24.766
JAKE: That's us.CLAIRE: Yeah.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.507
Yeah, y-you're probably right.

16:26.550 --> 16:30.119
Um, I guess we can
give it another try.

16:30.163 --> 16:33.993
Oh, my God! I am over the
moose with excitement.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.128
I guess I'll see you
next tax season, then.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.477
Hey, you can account
on that.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.526
Bye, Cooper.
You know, it's been fun.

16:45.569 --> 16:46.875
Oh, you know what,

16:46.918 --> 16:49.182
you take these Toaster Strudel
for the road, okay?

16:49.225 --> 16:51.184
Yeah. Yeah.Cool. All right.

16:51.227 --> 16:54.100
Uh, hey, uh,
thanks for everything.

16:55.666 --> 16:58.017
It was so nice
to meet you, Jake.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.453
Bye, Clug.

17:01.281 --> 17:04.197
Clug? That's not even a name!

17:05.763 --> 17:08.201
â™ª

17:08.244 --> 17:10.725
Cheers.
To having our house back.

17:10.768 --> 17:12.074
It's been a week
since Cooper left.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.076
Do you think our boy's
doing okay?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.556
Cooper is a human dolphin.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.079
He's happy everywhere.

17:17.123 --> 17:20.300
That's true. It was pretty fun
having him here, though.

17:20.343 --> 17:23.868
And it had been forever
since we'd gone out dancing.

17:23.912 --> 17:27.524
Oh, what is going on in here?

17:27.568 --> 17:29.483
BONNIE:
Jake, Claire!

17:29.526 --> 17:30.571
Oh, damn, Jake!

17:30.614 --> 17:32.573
How could you two
be getting it on

17:32.616 --> 17:34.096
at a time like this?

17:34.140 --> 17:37.360
You two, you kicked that
sweet boy out of your home,

17:37.404 --> 17:40.581
and I want you to see
just how sad you've made him.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.104
REPORTER:
Cooper, Sierra.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.106
REPORTER 2: Are you excited
to be back together?

17:44.150 --> 17:45.238
Well, we...

17:45.281 --> 17:46.717
I'll tell you what
I told Cooper earlier.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.502
He's very happy.

17:48.545 --> 17:51.287
Wow, I don't think I've ever
seen Cooper not smiling.

17:51.331 --> 17:52.723
He's miserable.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.595
And do you see what restaurant
he's coming out of?

17:54.638 --> 17:56.771
Oh, my God.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.947
Is that Le Jardin Bleu?

17:58.990 --> 18:01.602
No way.
He told me he was gonna go,

18:01.645 --> 18:03.473
but I thought he was
just saying that.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.997
Turns out he's just a sweet guy.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.609
I mean, it's nice and all,
but this is the life

18:08.652 --> 18:10.785
he's supposed to be leading.CLAIRE: Ugh.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.265
We never should have
sent him back to her.

18:12.308 --> 18:13.701
JAKE:
Yeah, right, but...

18:13.744 --> 18:15.442
what's the alternative,
have him come live with us?

18:15.485 --> 18:17.966
I don't know, I mean, he needs
someone looking out for him,

18:18.009 --> 18:19.620
and he sure as heck
isn't getting it

18:19.663 --> 18:20.925
from anyone else
in his life.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.755
You're right.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.931
Come on, Claire,
let's go get our boy.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.672
BONNIE: Oh, yay.
GERALD: Yes.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.718
â™ª

18:31.762 --> 18:33.547
Oh, man, this is
so good, man.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.679
Ouais. Ouais.

18:35.723 --> 18:37.203
C'est trÃ¨s magnifique.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.552
C'est trÃ¨s
magnifique, Cooper.

18:38.595 --> 18:40.902
How much longer are we thinking?

18:40.945 --> 18:42.947
I can feel my heartbeat
in my face.

18:45.515 --> 18:48.214
What on earth is
going on in here?

18:48.257 --> 18:49.215
Hey, guys.

18:49.258 --> 18:51.391
Uh, hey, uh, Cooper.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.567
We need...
we need to talk to you.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.351
Ugh. Clug.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.180
Let's take a five.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.139
Let's go.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.662
So good to see you guys.

19:01.705 --> 19:06.275
Wait, it is you guys, right?
I-I'm starting to hallucinate.

19:06.319 --> 19:09.452
Uh, can somebody get him
down from there, please?

19:09.496 --> 19:12.412
Um, so, Cooper,

19:12.455 --> 19:14.196
we've been thinking that...
that maybe you were

19:14.240 --> 19:16.372
a little too hasty
in leaving our house.

19:16.416 --> 19:19.158
And I know we just started
getting to know you,

19:19.201 --> 19:20.594
but I feel like
it's long enough

19:20.637 --> 19:22.813
to know that
all th... all this

19:22.857 --> 19:25.555
just, uh... just
isn't you, man.

19:25.599 --> 19:29.255
Yeah, and-and even though
we said it would be weird

19:29.298 --> 19:32.258
for you to live with a lame
married couple like us...

19:32.301 --> 19:33.607
We do think you
belong in a place

19:33.650 --> 19:36.349
where you could
be an ordinary guy

19:47.664 --> 19:50.363
Look, Sierra,
you're incredible, but...

19:50.406 --> 19:51.973
being around Jake
and Claire this week,

19:52.016 --> 19:54.802
it's made me want
something different.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.108
So does that mean you're gonna
come live with us for a bit?

19:57.152 --> 19:59.372
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.330
All right!

20:01.374 --> 20:03.680
I can't believe
you're doing this to me.
