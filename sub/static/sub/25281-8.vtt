00:26.110 --> 00:28.387
I want you to come away with me.

00:29.805 --> 00:32.658
I think it would be good just
to get away from all this.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.193
I had a dream about us last night.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.300
That we were married.

Tom Wyatt. Leave me a message.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.759
Hey, hola, muchacho.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.012
Listen, uh...

02:58.053 --> 03:00.055
this is the fourth message
I've left here.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.891
I'm getting a little nervous.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.351
I'm having a little difficulty
getting ahold of our, uh,

03:04.393 --> 03:07.438
our friend south of the border.

03:07.479 --> 03:10.649
As in, "No pesos, no mÃ¡s."

03:10.691 --> 03:12.526
Capiche? All right?

03:12.568 --> 03:16.071
Now, uh, I shouldn't
be worried, should I?

03:18.365 --> 03:21.285
Uh... I mean, I... I mean,
I'm not, I'm not worried.

03:21.327 --> 03:24.121
I'm not worried. Uh... uh...

03:24.163 --> 03:26.749
No, you're probably on vacation, right?

03:26.790 --> 03:28.292
In fact, I think,
I think you said something

03:28.334 --> 03:29.585
about going on vacation.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.003
Yeah. That's actually a good idea.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.838
I think I may, uh...
I may join you on that.

03:32.880 --> 03:38.594
So I will talk to you, uh, later. Bye.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.556
Fuck.

03:46.644 --> 03:49.146
Fuck. Fuck.

03:49.188 --> 03:51.148
Fuck, fuck. Fuck.

03:51.190 --> 03:54.818
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck.

03:59.198 --> 04:02.201
Okay. All right.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.378
Can I help you?

04:13.111 --> 04:14.630
Hi, Pete.

04:14.672 --> 04:16.923
This is gonna go a lot easier
if you cooperate.

04:17.406 --> 04:18.603
Okay.

04:18.646 --> 04:20.678
Well, you know who I am,

04:20.719 --> 04:22.445
but I don't know who you are.

04:22.487 --> 04:24.598
Yeah, well, I'm Billy, and this is Patty.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.350
We were Julio Suarez's lawyers.

04:26.392 --> 04:29.353
I'd suggest you start
from the beginning and tell us

04:29.395 --> 04:31.897
every fucking thing you know. Okay?

04:31.939 --> 04:34.066
Loomis is dead, Roman's dead.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.986
You want to be next,
or you want to fucking talk?

04:37.027 --> 04:40.447
Look, man, I-I don't know what...

04:41.139 --> 04:43.367
- who you're talking about. Who?
- Yeah, okay.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.995
Don't bullshit me, motherfucker. Okay?

04:46.036 --> 04:48.330
Either I fucking kill you,
or somebody else is.

04:48.372 --> 04:51.083
I think you know who I'm talking
about, right, motherfucker?

04:51.125 --> 04:53.669
All right, look, I'll... For real, okay?

04:53.711 --> 04:58.173
Totally honest. Real talk.
Okay, yes, I...

04:58.215 --> 05:00.575
All I did was I...

05:01.385 --> 05:04.304
put money in a locker for Keith Roman.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.723
That... so, that...

05:05.764 --> 05:06.932
That's all you did? Real simple, huh?

05:06.974 --> 05:09.101
That's it. Jesus! I was...

05:09.143 --> 05:10.227
I was just a bag boy.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.854
- Start fucking talking.
- Okay. Okay.

05:11.895 --> 05:12.938
Okay. All right, all right.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.481
- Listen, let's... stop it!
- Really?

05:14.523 --> 05:16.775
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I ain't pissed at your car.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.027
- I'm pissed at you, dude.
- Okay.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.011
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.281
I'll give you what you want,

05:22.322 --> 05:24.074
but I'm-I'm gonna need full immunity.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.701
All right?

05:25.743 --> 05:27.536
And a, and a couple of other things.

05:28.687 --> 05:30.289
Two...

05:30.814 --> 05:32.190
two things.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.544
Watch your head.

05:35.586 --> 05:36.628
Guy's a real piece of work.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.088
Oh, we know.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.549
His testimony gives us Wyatt
dead to rights

05:40.591 --> 05:42.217
on money laundering, drug trafficking

05:42.259 --> 05:45.262
through Gabriel Ortega's La Mano Cartel.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.958
Name Claudia Quintero
mean anything to you?

05:51.168 --> 05:52.811
- Should it?
- Well, she's a signatory

05:52.853 --> 05:54.396
on all the shell corporations.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.881
We'll look into her.

05:58.884 --> 06:00.594
What about Julio?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.513
Connecting Wyatt to Julio's
death is gonna be a lot harder.

06:05.182 --> 06:07.910
Okay, well, I'll talk to Wyatt
and make the connection.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.312
I'll be picking Wyatt up soon.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.331
Anything that happens
between now and then,

06:13.064 --> 06:14.958
I don't know anything about.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.086
Understood.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.175
You know, Wyatt could be dangerous.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.703
Oh, shit.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.986
One more.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.101
Perfect.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.290
It's completely... incomplete.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.921
Mm.

07:04.842 --> 07:08.053
Patty what's-her-who

07:08.095 --> 07:09.596
really wants to talk to you right now.

07:09.638 --> 07:10.789
Fuck.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.267
Yeah, I should get that.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.771
Okay.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.486
What's up?

07:25.178 --> 07:26.697
Are you with Tom Wyatt?

07:26.738 --> 07:28.807
Yeah, why?

07:39.209 --> 07:42.487
Yeah, um... Okay, what time
does his plane get in?

07:48.618 --> 07:50.960
Okay. Yeah, all right.

07:51.001 --> 07:53.915
I'll, um, I'll call you back
once I get to LAX.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.686
Oh, okay. All right, yeah. Bye.

07:58.044 --> 07:59.754
What's that all about?

08:00.355 --> 08:02.691
Uh, Tom, I'm so sorry.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.902
- Aw.
- I know.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.905
We were gonna have so much fun.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.432
- It's very inconvenient timing.
- I know.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.451
Planes are always late.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.661
We could probably just finish up.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.580
- No, I, um...
- It's okay. It's okay.

08:16.622 --> 08:20.075
But he's... he's about to get in.

08:20.117 --> 08:24.311
Yeah, and he can take a fucking
taxi, like everybody else.

08:24.352 --> 08:26.215
I-I promised that I'd get him.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.677
I forgot.

08:58.475 --> 08:59.998
Everything okay?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.900
No, not really.

09:05.683 --> 09:07.822
Okay.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.038
You hurt my feelings, Brittany.

09:15.931 --> 09:18.308
I-I don't understand.

09:20.418 --> 09:23.230
I think you understand perfectly well.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.651
Tom, honestly, I...

09:27.693 --> 09:30.237
Don't fucking tell me what you
fucking didn't do!

09:30.279 --> 09:32.322
You fucking ruined it!

09:34.449 --> 09:36.493
Okay.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.687
You fucking lied to me.

09:39.185 --> 09:41.229
You tried to get away from me.

09:45.005 --> 09:47.320
Get the fuck out before I get upset.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.522
There are those who will disagree

10:05.564 --> 10:08.108
with the future we see so clearly.

10:08.150 --> 10:13.096
But with every setback,
we will move forward together.

10:14.448 --> 10:18.201
To my community,
to my supporters, tonight...

10:19.286 --> 10:20.996
"One L.A."

10:21.038 --> 10:23.940
That's really fucking funny,
Marisol Silva!

10:24.666 --> 10:28.670
Marisol! Marisol!

10:28.712 --> 10:30.422
Come out here and face me!

10:31.840 --> 10:36.553
She tried to kill my dad, you know that?

10:36.595 --> 10:39.806
I know what you fucking did, you bitch!

10:39.848 --> 10:42.601
You come near my fucking family again,

10:42.642 --> 10:44.227
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

10:44.269 --> 10:46.563
Do you hear me?!

10:46.605 --> 10:47.856
She's a fucking liar!

10:47.898 --> 10:50.275
You don't even fucking know who she is!

10:54.721 --> 10:57.032
Come on out, little jailbird.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.664
Do you hate me?

11:05.065 --> 11:07.667
Of course not, silly. Come on.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.215
- Thanks again, Harper.
- You got it.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.386
Please don't tell Mom.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.637
Who do you think I am?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.288
Why would I do that?

11:22.040 --> 11:24.351
Are you okay?

11:24.393 --> 11:25.543
Hmm?

11:26.686 --> 11:28.647
I feel like a fucking idiot.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.690
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.529
I should've known.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.031
Yeah, I know. You said that before.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.117
Once again, that makes two of us.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.564
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

11:46.957 --> 11:48.917
I don't feel good.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.424
Let's go. Come on.

12:08.044 --> 12:10.130
I'm fucked, aren't I?

12:12.732 --> 12:15.135
We are both fucked.

12:23.017 --> 12:27.372
I suppose you are gonna ask me
if it was ever real...

12:29.749 --> 12:32.026
...if I ever loved you.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.555
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:08.597 --> 13:10.064
You okay?

13:14.794 --> 13:18.156
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.325
Sorry.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.410
Me, too.

13:23.995 --> 13:26.097
You gonna be okay to drive?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.476
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

13:29.518 --> 13:30.810
Thanks.

13:31.502 --> 13:33.171
Glad you're okay.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.066
Thanks, Patty.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.859
Okay.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.578
Hey.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.247
Hey.

13:51.314 --> 13:53.500
You have something of mine.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.068
What are you talking about?

13:56.374 --> 13:57.793
Try again.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.785
I needed it.

14:06.263 --> 14:07.956
Unbelievable.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.394
You know, the last thing
I wanted to believe

14:12.435 --> 14:14.813
is that you would completely
screw me by stealing this.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.815
What, did anyone notice it was gone?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.817
- That's not the point.
- So, what's the point?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.909
What makes you think that
this is all right, Patty?

14:20.951 --> 14:22.529
We hit a dead end with Julio

14:22.571 --> 14:23.905
and you weren't helping us fast enough.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.679
- What was I supposed to do?
- You broke the chain of custody

14:25.721 --> 14:27.967
and you're a smart lawyer,
so you fucking knew that.

14:28.009 --> 14:30.328
I'm sorry that you're hurt, but,
I mean, I would do it again.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.373
You know I could have you arrested?

14:33.415 --> 14:35.250
- Sure, but you won't.
- No.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.818
No, I won't.

14:38.695 --> 14:40.714
I guess you got what you really wanted.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.115
What?

14:44.742 --> 14:46.678
Bye, Patty.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.896
Shit.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.429
I really do appreciate you
staying over here with her.

15:29.954 --> 15:31.431
Of course.

15:32.248 --> 15:34.225
You know, Tom sent me these.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.269
Yeah?

15:38.480 --> 15:41.941
Yeah, you know, the fucked up
thing is I really liked him.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.263
Like, I felt bad for him.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.366
Hmm.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.122
I can never get it right.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.109
Yeah, hardly anyone can.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.058
Hi there.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.396
Hey, how's it going?

16:58.437 --> 17:00.186
Sorry I couldn't find an ashtray.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.880
Hope it's not a family heirloom
or something.

17:04.799 --> 17:06.984
It's a fun little surprise
having you here.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.737
Oh, I don't know if
I'd call it fun or not.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.555
Yeah, I'm not sure, either.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.407
I'm assuming this is about Brittany.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.160
No, it's not.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.623
Okay. You want to be friends?

17:21.691 --> 17:25.502
I had a talk with your business
associate, Pete Oakland.

17:25.545 --> 17:29.574
He gave you up on money
laundering, drug trafficking...

17:30.467 --> 17:33.387
we got you connected
to the La Mano Cartel.

17:33.429 --> 17:34.996
You know, little shit.

17:36.264 --> 17:40.001
He gave us enough to put you
away for quite some time, bud.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.133
That doesn't sound like
little shit, that sounds like...

17:48.067 --> 17:50.445
sounds like big boy stuff right there.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.863
Yeah.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.453
Well, I'm honored that you
think of me that way.

17:58.495 --> 18:03.333
Um... I can assure you,
I'm just a real estate guy.

18:03.374 --> 18:04.883
I'm not a kingpin.

18:04.924 --> 18:09.923
Uh, your friend, Pete, is a dipshit.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.175
His testimony will never hold up
in court.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.469
My lawyers will fucking squash him.

18:14.511 --> 18:18.807
So, unless you have something
legitimate to discuss...

18:21.643 --> 18:24.295
...would you mind getting
the fuck out of my kitchen?

18:26.422 --> 18:30.235
Is conspiracy to commit murder
legitimate enough for you?

18:33.613 --> 18:36.724
And who did I conspire to murder exactly?

18:41.270 --> 18:43.081
You had to get rid of Julio

18:43.122 --> 18:45.166
to cover up all your shit, didn't you?

18:47.818 --> 18:49.862
You think I got rid of...

18:51.130 --> 18:52.698
Come on.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.051
I thought you're supposed to be

18:55.093 --> 18:59.138
this top-tier, hot-shit attorney.

19:01.082 --> 19:02.934
You really don't know?

19:05.937 --> 19:09.107
Well, I watched her work you over.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.551
I knew she could do some gnarly shit.

19:12.110 --> 19:15.179
I didn't realize how gnarly until...

19:16.155 --> 19:18.366
until she gave that order.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.793
Yeah, you should talk
to Marisol about Julio.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.881
You don't want to believe me,

19:32.922 --> 19:34.757
but you do 'cause it makes sense.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.427
Politician, have to clean up her shit.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.639
I'm really sorry, bud.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.547
I honestly thought
you were smarter than that,

19:43.588 --> 19:45.960
but I guess, um...

19:47.053 --> 19:49.681
I guess love really is blind.

19:56.554 --> 19:59.073
Well, here's something you don't know.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.618
Yeah? What's that?

20:04.162 --> 20:07.231
Your other business partner,
Gabriel Ortega,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.818
that's her brother.

20:13.009 --> 20:14.647
Fuck you. Who told you that?

20:14.688 --> 20:16.032
He did.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.909
Looks like we both got played.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.829
The only difference is

20:22.722 --> 20:24.707
I'm not going to prison.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.545
That will give you
plenty of time to jerk off.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.815
Might even have some help.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.861
So I'll get the fuck out of your kitchen.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.407
Jesus, you're the one
that introduced Tom to La Mano.

20:41.449 --> 20:42.825
Through a friend of a friend.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.452
I-I... I don't know the guy at all.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.578
And I never would've been involved

20:45.620 --> 20:46.871
with anything like this.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.706
All I did was arrange for you to meet.

20:48.748 --> 20:52.085
I don't know her.
I've never met her before.

20:52.126 --> 20:56.130
You have a relationship with
her, and we need her happy.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.301
Hi. You've reached Marisol Silva.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.221
- Fucking pick up. Come on.
- Please leave a message.

21:06.307 --> 21:07.350
Hi. You've reached Marisol Silva.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.632
Pick up. Don't you fucking dodge me. Hey!

21:09.674 --> 21:13.690
Hey! You're avoiding me.
That's a bad fucking move!

21:13.731 --> 21:15.900
Yeah, I know about you
and your brother Gabriel, huh?

21:15.942 --> 21:17.944
Yeah, you didn't think
I'd know about that, did you?

21:17.986 --> 21:19.278
Well, guess what?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.823
After everything I did for you,
you're gonna fuck me over?

21:21.864 --> 21:22.991
I don't think so.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.326
You're not as safe
as you think you are, okay?

21:25.368 --> 21:27.787
Enjoy City Hall. It's not gonna
last fucking long.

21:27.829 --> 21:30.748
Fuck!

21:30.790 --> 21:33.042
Fuck.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.293
Fuck!

21:38.006 --> 21:40.091
Fuck.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.025
Hey, is that her?

22:16.377 --> 22:19.338
Elena. Hey.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.923
I'm Billy McBride.

22:20.965 --> 22:23.843
My daughter Denise worked
the campaign with you.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.887
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. Yeah.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.181
- Um, this is Patty. Sorry.
- I'm Patty Solis-Papagian, hi.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.224
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm right in the middle of a...

22:30.266 --> 22:31.476
No, no. Hang on just a second.

22:31.959 --> 22:34.228
Denise was real fond of you.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.855
She talked about you all the time.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.149
- She said you're a great person.
- She's lovely.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.776
Yeah, she's a great girl, right.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.944
Anyway, she told me
you were fired. Is that right?

22:42.636 --> 22:45.031
No, I got another job opportunity.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.242
We need information

22:48.284 --> 22:51.162
on Marisol Silva, that's why we're here.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.521
I can't help you.

22:53.164 --> 22:55.070
You don't even know what
I'm gonna ask you yet, so...

22:55.111 --> 22:56.358
What happened to your face?

22:57.348 --> 22:58.402
I tripped.

22:59.875 --> 23:01.572
So they got to you.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.051
Look, we can offer you protection

23:05.093 --> 23:06.660
if you give us some information.

23:06.702 --> 23:08.763
Please. I don't want any part of this.

23:09.163 --> 23:11.891
Elena. Elena.

23:11.933 --> 23:15.978
Please. Will you, will you
just hear me out?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.183
I know you want to help us,

23:22.225 --> 23:25.471
and we can really use it,
so, please, anything you have.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.019
I'll tell you this,

23:32.785 --> 23:34.688
Marisol isn't who she says she is.

23:35.940 --> 23:37.708
Her real name is Claudia Quintero.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.710
Wait, wait, wait. How do you know that?

23:42.421 --> 23:44.423
Talk to Sister Maria Isabella

23:44.465 --> 23:46.008
at the church in Marisol's hometown.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.845
And if anyone asks, I will deny
ever having this conversation.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.538
Do not talk to me again.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.949
Excuse me, do you speak English?

24:09.991 --> 24:12.980
- Yes, a-a-a little.
- Okay.

24:13.021 --> 24:15.872
- Are you Sister Maria Isabella?
- No.

24:15.913 --> 24:17.415
Do you know where she is?

24:17.815 --> 24:21.335
S-Sister Maria Isabella
is, um, desaparecido.

24:21.770 --> 24:22.980
Gone.

24:25.339 --> 24:27.133
Do you know the name Claudia Quintero?

24:27.175 --> 24:29.010
- No.
- Well, can we at least look

24:29.051 --> 24:31.637
at your parishioner records,
or baptism records,

24:31.679 --> 24:32.847
- anything like that?
- No, no.

24:32.889 --> 24:35.233
No. Why? Why not?

24:35.274 --> 24:36.917
It's destroyed.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.244
How you doing? I need to talk to Gabriel.

24:55.286 --> 24:57.747
Nobody by that name lives here.

24:57.788 --> 25:00.374
Yeah, Gabriel.
That's it... I was just here.

25:01.025 --> 25:03.002
I'm sorry, senor.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.545
I don't know you.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.282
Yeah, you do.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.177
I'm sorry, senor.

25:12.776 --> 25:14.764
Who are you?

25:16.140 --> 25:17.499
Who are you?

25:20.311 --> 25:22.763
Who is this?

25:22.804 --> 25:26.651
Look, I need to talk to Gabriel.
That's all. Please.

25:29.153 --> 25:30.388
Who?

25:30.430 --> 25:33.032
Gabriel Ortega, the guy who lives here.

25:33.074 --> 25:35.326
White suit, beard, that guy.

25:35.368 --> 25:37.370
I don't know what your problem is,

25:37.411 --> 25:39.038
but I've lived here for ten years.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.582
Yeah, well, my problem is,
I need to talk to Gabriel

25:41.624 --> 25:43.209
and for some reason,
you're not letting me.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.505
No, no. I-I need to talk to Gabriel.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.084
Hang on a second.

25:52.051 --> 25:56.305
Hey, buddy. Eduardo, right?

25:56.347 --> 25:57.894
No.

25:57.936 --> 26:00.601
Yeah, Eduardo. You remember me, right?

26:00.643 --> 26:02.019
With Gabriel?

26:02.461 --> 26:03.938
Gabriel.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.564
- Hmm. Quien?
- Gabriel, your boss.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.650
El jefe. The guy who whacked
your rig off there.

26:07.692 --> 26:09.277
And he was seeing if it was okay.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.153
Remember? He was looking at your arm.

26:11.195 --> 26:14.532
No. No.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.158
Where's Gabriel, dude?

26:16.200 --> 26:19.078
Cut the bullshit.
You speak English, right?

26:19.120 --> 26:20.913
- You speak English?
- No.

26:20.955 --> 26:23.357
- Ugh. Let's go. Come on.
- You're lying to me.

26:24.274 --> 26:26.377
How many fucking guys have one
hand out here doing this shit?

26:26.419 --> 26:27.878
I'm telling you, this...

26:27.920 --> 26:29.880
everything about this,
this place. Eduardo.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.508
- He looked. I'm telling you.
- He didn't look. He didn't look.

26:32.550 --> 26:35.428
- The son of a bitch looked at me.
- He didn't look at you.

26:35.469 --> 26:37.471
Ugh.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.646
This is Elena.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.065
Elena, hi. It's Billy McBride.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.483
Listen, I really need your help.

26:49.525 --> 26:52.403
I don't know a Billy McBride.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.179
Don't call back.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.365
I want you to tell me that you love me.

27:43.771 --> 27:46.749
I suppose you are gonna ask me
if it was ever real...

27:49.276 --> 27:51.295
...if I ever loved you.

28:14.235 --> 28:16.445
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

28:16.487 --> 28:18.447
- Is Anita here yet?
- Uh, five minutes late.

28:18.489 --> 28:22.243
All right, um, push Lou
15 minutes and then...

28:22.284 --> 28:23.911
- Tom Wyatt?
- Uh, yeah.

28:23.953 --> 28:25.371
We have a warrant for your arrest.

28:25.413 --> 28:26.831
- Oh, cool.
- On the car.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.666
- Whoa. On the car, okay.
- I'll call your lawyer.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.085
Yeah, call Roger. He'll get me
out of this real quick.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.462
I'll be back before you miss me.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.343
I'm gonna go have one.

28:59.368 --> 29:01.198
- I'll-I'll see you.
- Okay.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.850
- Hey, Patty.
- Yeah?

29:03.617 --> 29:05.119
Listen.

29:05.727 --> 29:07.746
You know, uh...

29:12.710 --> 29:14.628
Yeah.

29:28.601 --> 29:31.628
Hey. That's a good sign.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.031
- Could be temporary, but...
- Eh.

29:35.072 --> 29:36.258
Yeah.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.237
With Patty, you got to take
what you can get.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.996
We're here for Tom Wyatt.

29:49.038 --> 29:50.956
He's under arrest. Which way?

29:50.998 --> 29:52.875
You already arrested him.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.401
What?

29:55.794 --> 29:59.089
When Alo became popular...

29:59.131 --> 30:01.759
well, everything changed for our family.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.577
We were no longer poor.

30:03.618 --> 30:06.764
And it was my father who started
shipping Alo internationally.

30:06.805 --> 30:10.518
It wasn't long after that he was
approached by a friend who,

30:10.559 --> 30:15.064
well, he had some ties
to the cartel. And...

30:20.986 --> 30:23.597
Before we make this business official,

30:24.657 --> 30:26.075
I would like to show you something.

30:26.116 --> 30:27.493
Please come with me.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.248
Please.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.666
Hey.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.668
What happened? I thought
I was getting arrested.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.419
You're doing very well, Tom.

30:37.461 --> 30:38.837
Thanks to you.

30:38.879 --> 30:40.923
- You saved my ass, pal.
- Yeah.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.413
What's wrong with him?

30:51.350 --> 30:52.726
Given time,

30:52.768 --> 30:54.937
a man can get used to almost anything.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.818
Oh, shit.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.988
What'd you do? You stole...

31:04.029 --> 31:05.573
Look at me.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.534
Ah. Do-do I still have my dick?

31:08.576 --> 31:10.035
Oh, please, Tom. I'm not a monster.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.621
- Yeah!
- Not a monster, Tom. Yes.

31:12.663 --> 31:13.765
But, Tom, I know

31:13.790 --> 31:15.249
- how much you love to talk.
- I look so good.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.001
So, unfortunately,

31:17.693 --> 31:19.253
you're not gonna get used
to losing your tongue.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.713
You don't have to take my tongue.

31:20.754 --> 31:23.132
- Mm-hmm.
- I won't. I... you're my friend.

31:23.173 --> 31:24.508
I'm not gonna talk. Look, I'll zip it.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.843
I'll zip it right up.

31:25.884 --> 31:29.305
I pro... hey, hey. I cross my heart.

31:29.346 --> 31:32.141
Oh, don't you lack the means to do so?

31:32.182 --> 31:34.852
- That's funny.
- Mm-hmm.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.395
- You're funny.
- Open up.

31:36.437 --> 31:39.064
- You-You-You're a good friend.
- Mm-hmm.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.774
- Okay. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- All right, Tom.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.818
No.

31:42.860 --> 31:45.112
No, no. No.

31:45.154 --> 31:47.948
There you go. There you go.

32:55.391 --> 32:57.601
Hey, stranger.

33:02.709 --> 33:04.252
Why here?

33:06.310 --> 33:08.512
'Cause I want to show you something.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.754
Uh, you don't...

33:26.155 --> 33:27.948
Thank you.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.465
Congratulations.

34:14.678 --> 34:17.347
You won, honey.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.650
You see that?

34:29.693 --> 34:31.695
It's all yours.

34:43.398 --> 34:44.958
All those things you told me

34:45.000 --> 34:47.835
you wanted to do for this place,
I hope you do them.

34:47.878 --> 34:49.670
I really do.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.496
I hope you're a huge success.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.003
I suppose you are...

35:07.105 --> 35:09.650
gonna ask me if it was ever real,

35:09.691 --> 35:12.319
if I ever loved you.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.408
I never did.

36:05.397 --> 36:07.232
What you did to me...

36:08.407 --> 36:10.402
or what you tried to do to me...

36:12.629 --> 36:14.698
and what you did to Julio...

36:19.803 --> 36:21.430
...I really hope

36:22.622 --> 36:24.141
that at the end of the night

36:24.182 --> 36:26.126
when you lay your head on the pillow,

36:27.711 --> 36:30.230
that the last image you see

36:30.272 --> 36:34.192
is that kid hanging
from that fucking cord.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.874
Thank you for the wishes.
