WEBVTT

00:14.598 --> 00:16.600
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616,
you have course confirmation.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.856
You are cleared
direct to The Slingshot.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.947
Agent Coulson,
everything all right up there?

00:22.064 --> 00:24.533
We heard you had
a little dustup on the ground.

00:24.608 --> 00:25.951
Yeah, we're all good.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.030
It's gonna be blue skies
from here on out.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.537
Aah!

00:37.162 --> 00:38.505
Aah!

00:38.830 --> 00:40.798
Coulson, hang on!

01:03.480 --> 01:06.825
Hey. No joyrides, okay?
That's my house.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.156
No worries.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.824
Where do they think of this stuff?

01:17.995 --> 01:21.090
Skye? The girl's not qualified
to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

01:21.164 --> 01:24.338
Agreed. That's why
I've invited her on as a consultant.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.846
S.H.I.E.L.D. does it all the time.
Technically, Stark's a consultant.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.265
And technically, Skye's
a member of the Rising Tide.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.512
She hacked our RSA implementation.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.432
Twice. From a laptop.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.604
Imagine what she'll do
with our resources.

01:36.972 --> 01:40.192
I am. That's exactly
what I'm imagining during this frown.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.441
You brought me on
for risk assessment? She's a risk.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.360
She doesn't think like us.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.150
Exactly.

01:51.403 --> 01:55.158
Agent Coulson told us the news.
What a wonderful surprise.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.833
-Isn't it, Fitz?
-Yeah. Yeah, it's a surprise.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.956
No, it's wonderful.
You must be very excited.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.959
Yep. First day of school.

02:02.414 --> 02:05.588
Okay, so, it's just... Sorry. Yeah.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.795
We have two kids on this bus
who aren't cleared for combat.

02:08.878 --> 02:09.880
You're adding a third.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.807
At least Fitz-Simmons
are trained S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.635
But Skye?

02:14.718 --> 02:16.265
You said this was a select team.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.310
Assembled to work new cases,
to protect people.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.266
I don't see how
letting some hacker tag along...

02:21.391 --> 02:23.393
I'm looking for an objection
I haven't already anticipated.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.364
I'm calling this,
but your frown will be on record.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.533
We've been called in
to investigate an 084.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.155
We all know what that means.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.454
Yes, we do. It means
we don't know what that means.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.830
Officially, it's an
Airborne Mobile Command Station,

02:38.909 --> 02:41.037
but we call it "the bus."

02:41.787 --> 02:44.131
We find it best to use shorthand
when in the field.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.626
But everything has to be just so,
you know? Because of the danger.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.845
Yeah, I've been up here before,
but I didn't see much,

02:49.920 --> 02:52.423
because of the bag
that Agent Ward put over my head.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.767
Yes, so sorry about that. Water?

02:56.259 --> 02:58.136
Wheels up in two.
Lock it or lose it.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.308
What's that mean?

02:59.429 --> 03:01.773
No backing out now.
Let's find a bunk for our guest.

03:01.890 --> 03:05.110
Yeah, and there's only one left
and it's right next to mine.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.448
So... Sorry. You can...

03:14.194 --> 03:15.616
Hey. I know we didn't really...

03:15.737 --> 03:18.286
Might want to read that.
This isn't like other planes.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.205
You could say that again.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.627
Say what again?

03:23.578 --> 03:24.795
Sweet ride.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.373
I earned a little goodwill
from Director Fury

03:26.456 --> 03:28.129
when I got hit
right before the Battle of New York.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.717
You took a bullet?

03:29.793 --> 03:34.173
Ish. An Asgardian stabbed me through
the heart with a Chitauri scepter.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.719
The effect was similar.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.972
Got a few weeks R&R and this plane.

03:38.468 --> 03:42.314
Had it completely refurbished, studs up.
Spared no expense.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.517
Yeah, Agent Ward told me
they sent you to Tahiti.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.063
It's a magical place.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.652
You mentioned that.

03:48.145 --> 03:51.319
Here. Use a coaster.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.202
I'd buckle up.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.535
- I don't even know where we're going.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.496
Peru.
That's where the 084 was reported.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.199
And an 084 is?

04:00.323 --> 04:02.667
An object of unknown origin.
Kind of like you.

04:03.493 --> 04:07.418
Team goes in, determines
if it's useful or if it poses a threat.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.249
The last one
turned out to be pretty interesting.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.879
And what was the last one?

04:11.418 --> 04:13.591
A hammer.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.135
Tire tracks 40 meters back.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.972
I'll check them against the site's trucks.
Make sure we're alone.

05:05.055 --> 05:08.980
Too much exposure here.
I'm gonna find a place to park.

05:11.269 --> 05:14.022
I would love to see
a capuchin in the wild.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.111
Maybe even a yellow-tailed
woolly monkey.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.785
You know, Peru has
32 different species of monkey.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.703
Yeah, and close to
200 species of snakes.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.407
The shushupe has a fascinating venom.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.164
It's neurotoxic,
proteoloic and hemolytic.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.334
- That's fascinating.
-Yeah.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.835
No, I'd be much more concerned
with earthquakes...

05:36.378 --> 05:38.176
There's no vaccine for dengue fever.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.303
Look at this.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.896
We should warn the people who live
around here if the 084 is dangerous.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.727
They're already dealing
with anti-mining rebels

05:51.810 --> 05:53.153
and the Shining Path guerillas.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.400
I could post something.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.948
Do you remember the panic when that
anti-matter meteor splashed down

05:57.023 --> 06:00.277
just off the coast of Miami,
nearly devoured the city?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.907
- No.
-Precisely.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.830
Because we kept it quiet and contained.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.203
So what am I doing?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.786
Well, if it gets out, I might need you
to create some kind of diversion.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.621
Put the public on the wrong scent.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.832
So everything that I'm against.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.416
Yep.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.007
--Good morning, Professor.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.885
I'm Agent Coulson, with S.H.I.E.L.D.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.554
I understand
you made an interesting discovery.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.681
I'm not sure how to explain it.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.684
This temple dates back
at least 500 years.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.562
It's filled with pre-Incan artifacts.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.353
One of them is impossible.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.029
And looks like it might be dangerous.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.106
Well, that's why we're here.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.453
Watch out.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.123
Exactly as we found it.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.664
Who else knows about this?

06:54.497 --> 06:56.090
Just the Ministry.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.420
I believe they are the ones
who contacted you.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.221
Sir, I need you and your team
to evacuate this site

07:02.297 --> 07:05.346
until we determine
the risk associated with this object.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.144
Leave the man alone.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.694
Now. For your own safety.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.027
There's nothing about this anywhere.
It's amazing.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.739
I searched every data stream.
What do we got here, guys?

07:28.365 --> 07:30.584
Whoa, careful, I... No. Wouldn't do that.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.832
The object's placement
in fossiliferous rock formations

07:32.911 --> 07:35.209
suggests it's been here
for at least 1,500 years.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.624
That pre-dates this temple
by a millennium.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.046
Maybe it's alien.

07:39.125 --> 07:43.221
Yeah, but the shape and
the craftsmanship, it's almost German.

07:47.592 --> 07:51.187
Tires match the prof's truck.
Where's your sidearm?

07:51.763 --> 07:53.356
If I need a gun, I'll take one.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.560
Right.
Forgot I was working with The Cavalry.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.274
Don't ever call me that.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.778
Apologies. I've heard the stories.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.658
What went down in Bahrain.
About you in action.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.245
You know, it was smart of Coulson
to pull you out of retirement.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.497
It's nice to have a trusted friend
who has your back.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.602
Should've taken more guns.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.580
- Sir?
- Go.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.956
We have a situation.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.834
Lots of rebels in this area.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.505
Not enough gunfire.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.208
Keep working. I'm on my way.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.560
Phillip?

09:17.348 --> 09:19.771
Camilla? Do you mind?

09:20.643 --> 09:21.860
After you.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.578
And now for a proper hello.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.871
Comandante.
A promotion, congratulations.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.457
Three years ago, but thank you.

09:42.540 --> 09:46.841
Agent Melinda May, Agent Grant Ward,
this is Comandante Camilla Reyes.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.218
She's with the Policia Militar del Peru.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.012
We used to work together
back in the day.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.186
Let the team know everything's okay.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.977
I know you found
a strange object on Peruvian soil.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.104
We should have a conversation
about how to proceed.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.275
Of course.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.353
But an 084
supersedes all national claims.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.234
You look good.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.856
Yeah, I work out.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.035
Come, let me show you something.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.160
Are you seeing this? It's alive.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.370
"Alive," alive?

10:16.491 --> 10:18.209
It has a functioning power source.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.543
Sleepy's reading radionuclides,

10:19.661 --> 10:21.538
but they don't match
any known isotope.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.757
I get temporal matches,
but even then they seem to shift.

10:23.873 --> 10:24.874
Is that even possible?

10:24.999 --> 10:29.505
It depends on the shifting
of the temporal radio stuff, so...

10:31.089 --> 10:33.683
It's totally weird, right?

10:34.217 --> 10:36.265
I'm gonna go check on Coulson.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.224
We've got company. National police.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.600
- What?
-Why are they here?

10:41.724 --> 10:44.022
They heard about this object,
they're probably here to protect it.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.729
This area has lots of rebel uprisings.

10:45.854 --> 10:46.855
Yeah, people are fighting back

10:46.938 --> 10:48.690
against the government's
mining policies.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.199
It's pretty kick-ass.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.735
Yeah. It's kick-ass. All the violence.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.362
That's not what I'm saying.

10:54.445 --> 10:57.949
I know it's what you're typing.
In your van, alone, where it's safe.

10:58.908 --> 10:59.955
How much longer?

11:00.076 --> 11:01.373
- What's the hurry?
-Are we in danger?

11:01.452 --> 11:04.922
Not if everyone does their job.
What is yours exactly?

11:06.916 --> 11:10.216
The cacao is from
a secret valley in Peru. Very special.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.093
The best chocolate in the world.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.424
- It could use some sugar.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.597
Americans.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.016
You know me, Camilla.
I'm a pretty simple guy.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.598
There was nothing simple
about your last mission here.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.063
I had some great help.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.108
There isn't any chance
we get to keep the device, is there?

11:27.228 --> 11:29.105
It's not mine to give,
but I'm sure we can find a way

11:29.230 --> 11:31.779
to resolve this respectfully
in a way that gives your...

11:33.776 --> 11:34.743
Rebels!

11:34.819 --> 11:36.321
Stay close, on my 6.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.411
Sounds like they're engaging
with rebels.

11:42.952 --> 11:43.953
Let's go.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.249
They're coming for it. Let's move!

11:47.332 --> 11:48.925
Come on.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.343
No. No, no, no.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.716
- It doesn't matter.
-It does to me!

11:52.795 --> 11:54.513
Please, let us do this!

11:54.631 --> 11:56.429
We need a containment case
for the 084.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.633
There's no time.

11:57.759 --> 12:01.354
But it has a fluctuating power core.
Frequencies way above 10 exahertz.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.692
Sorry. Science class is over.

12:07.977 --> 12:08.978
Whoa!

12:10.188 --> 12:11.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

12:11.522 --> 12:14.571
You did not just pull that out of the wall.
What is the matter with you?

12:14.651 --> 12:17.370
Do you realize we do not know
the amount of photon emissions

12:17.487 --> 12:19.330
coming out of this... Okay.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.915
And we don't know what'll happen
if it gets excited.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.037
Stay close.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.164
Fitz, come on!

12:29.832 --> 12:30.833
Come on.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.507
Your men need to fall back now
or we'll never make the runway.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.676
Now, your truck, let's go.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.525
--Get back!

12:56.192 --> 12:57.614
Tell your men to get down.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.087
My truck.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.225
Get in! Get in!

13:21.801 --> 13:22.893
Move! Now!

13:22.969 --> 13:24.391
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
-Yes, of course.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.190
- After you.
-After you.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.747
Coulson's secure in PMP's truck.
Take the south route to the airfield.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.040
Gotcha.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.584
Slow down!

13:54.709 --> 13:55.926
You're joking, right?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.591
Ward, listen! We've got to be careful!

13:57.712 --> 14:00.090
There's a binding energy structure
that could overheat!

14:00.423 --> 14:01.891
I could roll down a window!

14:04.093 --> 14:05.094
Do not roll down a window!

14:05.219 --> 14:08.268
Stay quiet and keep your heads down!

14:08.389 --> 14:10.437
Head left. The ravine empties.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.606
- But Ward...
- Quiet!

14:21.611 --> 14:23.909
- How fast can you have the wheels up?
-Fast.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.045
- Ramp!
-On it.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.466
What are you doing?
Coulson is still out there!

14:39.796 --> 14:41.969
Get off the ramp,
you're in the line of fire.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.072
Cut it pretty close, sir.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.573
Didn't want to leave anyone behind.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.406
I gotta say, I miss my van.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.658
Now, what was the problem?

15:09.450 --> 15:10.997
As I said before,

15:11.077 --> 15:14.752
this device has a high frequency
fluctuating sub-material compression...

15:14.831 --> 15:17.084
Fitz, in English.

15:17.166 --> 15:20.670
The 084 is fueled
by Tesseract technology.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.006
HYDRA, World War II,
Captain America.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.763
It's full of lethal amounts
of gamma radiation.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.344
Gamma? You're saying it's nuclear?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.020
No.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.524
He's saying it's much, much worse.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.201
And the 084
is in your possession?

15:48.322 --> 15:51.041
It's on board
and contains a Tesseract fuel cell.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.790
So there's that.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.798
Copy. You are a go for check-in
guidance through restricted airspace.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.841
- Safe travels.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.300
Top speed's a priority, May. Obviously.

16:04.547 --> 16:08.393
I know you didn't want to see combat.
I apologize for that.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.313
Do you need anything else

16:12.388 --> 16:17.144
before I go check on the device fueled
by evil that's sitting in our cargo hold'?

16:20.146 --> 16:21.739
This was fun.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.873
Not to worry. The device is stable.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.583
Not that it couldn't explode
at any minute,

16:36.662 --> 16:39.415
especially if hit with machine-gun fire.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.670
But things like this happen
from time to time when in the field.

16:43.753 --> 16:46.677
And at first, it's very unpleasant,
and you regret your decision

16:46.756 --> 16:47.757
- to leave the lab at all.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.684
Are you mental?
I did explain in great detail

16:50.760 --> 16:53.434
exactly what I meant
using the Queen's bloody English!

16:53.513 --> 16:55.265
I use normal English.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.609
Words like "duck" and "run"
and "might blow us to pieces."

16:58.684 --> 17:01.779
Wow. Congratulations, Agent Ward.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.858
You managed to string
three words together in a sentence.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.614
Is everyone all right?

17:07.734 --> 17:09.612
Banged up, but alive.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.577
Thank you for the extraction.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.122
But we lost a lot of men.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.712
We'll make sure
the rest of you get home safe.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.461
Are we safe on a plane with that?

17:20.873 --> 17:23.797
There's a PMP airfield in Equitos.
It's a short distance...

17:23.917 --> 17:27.137
We're going as fast as we can
for a S.H.I.E.L.D. containment facility.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.882
There's no safer place for us to go.

17:28.965 --> 17:32.469
Sir, if I may, do you have
anything to drink around here?

17:32.593 --> 17:36.143
Upstairs. I think you'll find it
quite comfortable up there.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.478
I expect a grand tour.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.559
I know you do.

17:39.642 --> 17:40.734
...we are dealing with!

17:40.810 --> 17:43.563
I don't understand
anything you're saying!

17:43.646 --> 17:45.819
Do we have a problem in here?

17:46.816 --> 17:47.817
No, sir.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.572
Just working on our communication.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.827
Not everyone
was prepared for a firefight.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.660
We got out, didn't lose anyone,
saved a few of theirs.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.411
I'd say we did all right.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.996
Anything else?

18:01.956 --> 18:03.333
Yeah, I have a small question.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.755
Because I've been feeling like
the tag-along, hayseed rookie,

18:05.835 --> 18:07.837
but now I get the sense
that Ward doesn't know

18:07.920 --> 18:09.012
which one's
Simmons and which one's Fitz,

18:09.130 --> 18:10.598
and they've seen
even less gunfire than me.

18:10.673 --> 18:13.768
And I'm no rocket scientist,
but is this your first mission together?

18:13.843 --> 18:15.516
No. Of course not.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.188
It's our second.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.350
I was your first? That's sweet.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.600
You're amused?

18:21.684 --> 18:23.027
I'm terrified!

18:23.102 --> 18:25.196
I am in way over my head,

18:25.271 --> 18:27.444
but I've been on this team
just as long as any of you.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.775
I might as well be team captain.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.615
Just joking.
But maybe that's not a bad idea,

18:35.698 --> 18:37.700
because these guys
do not like each other much.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.787
This isn't about that. I am a specialist.

18:40.870 --> 18:44.374
Today, I could have eliminated
the enemy threat if I was working alone,

18:44.498 --> 18:45.624
but I had non-combat ready agents...

18:45.708 --> 18:47.460
Whoa, whoa, wait, you work alone?

18:47.543 --> 18:49.966
It's so typical. Who do you think
designs your equipment?

18:50.046 --> 18:51.764
Or the polymers for your weaponry?

18:51.839 --> 18:53.056
Yeah, try going into the field

18:53.132 --> 18:54.258
-with just your bare bum!
-People like us do it.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.969
See them proving the point I just made?

18:56.052 --> 18:57.224
You're not wrong.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.564
We still need to iron out the kinks.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.479
But, Ward,
you can speak six languages.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.311
Simmons, you have two PhDs
in fields I can't pronounce,

19:05.394 --> 19:07.567
and, Fitz, you are a rocket scientist.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.491
So work it out.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.328
I'm good at stuff, too!

19:40.513 --> 19:41.765
...but really amazing to be here

19:41.847 --> 19:43.349
and have that bickering
and all that stuff.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.433
Yeah.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.565
After you.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.199
So should we work or just continue to...

19:55.277 --> 19:57.621
I'm saying
I said there would come a moment

19:57.738 --> 19:59.706
when we would regret the decision
to go in the field.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.535
I didn't think
that would happen in week one.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.790
on, God.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.375
This seam in the sedimentary layers

20:08.457 --> 20:10.710
suggests some sort of molten cave-in
a few decades back.

20:10.793 --> 20:14.718
Yeah, well, this here?
It's optical amplification.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.635
Now, I think...
Well, I'm most likely dead on,

20:18.718 --> 20:20.891
that the Tesseractic energy
excites plasma

20:20.970 --> 20:22.643
with an inverse population
of energy levels.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.977
A laser.

20:24.056 --> 20:28.232
A ray of pure energy. Two terajoules.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.562
See the amplifier?

20:29.645 --> 20:30.897
We're lucky the drones didn't trigger it

20:30.980 --> 20:33.153
while we were taking
electromagnetic readings.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.651
This is a weapon, powerful enough to...

20:34.775 --> 20:37.494
Enough to melt through 50 feet
of solid rock to bury itself.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.413
Imagine what it could do to a person.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.831
Yeah, or an airplane.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.288
For example.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.839
Hunger Games?

20:50.166 --> 20:54.342
Matterhorn. One of 100 books my S.O.
gave me that I'm just getting around to.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.928
S.O.? Supervising Officer?

20:58.007 --> 21:01.477
Got it. Hackers have lingo, too,
but I'll pick yours up.

21:02.344 --> 21:07.020
I feel like you and me, wrong foot.
Can I buy you a drink?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.443
What I said before,
when I said the uprising was...

21:14.690 --> 21:16.613
Whatever I said. A good thing?

21:16.692 --> 21:17.864
I don't want you to think I'm oblivious.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.704
What I was talking about
was the tweets.

21:20.821 --> 21:24.166
Tweets. Are you trying to make things
better or worse?

21:24.450 --> 21:27.624
Peruvians have organized
for the first time in decades.

21:27.953 --> 21:32.459
Thousands of suffering people who've
never met uniting over a common idea?

21:32.541 --> 21:34.635
It's mind-blowing.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.462
And I don't wanna bring it up,

21:36.545 --> 21:38.547
because I don't want to
see your hate face,

21:40.633 --> 21:42.385
but that's what
the Rising Tide is all about.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.641
Okay-

21:44.720 --> 21:47.894
Usually, one person
doesn't have the solution.

21:48.015 --> 21:51.189
But 100 people,
with 1% of the solution?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.067
That'll get it done.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.067
I think that's beautiful.

21:59.068 --> 22:01.537
Pieces solving a puzzle.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.253
You and I see the world differently is all.

22:11.831 --> 22:15.426
I've never been in a war zone
during a war. Till today.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.261
That was crazy.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.510
Take it you've seen that a lot?

22:22.633 --> 22:24.681
What... Did you get shot?

22:24.760 --> 22:26.387
Skin-deep, nothing to worry about.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.813
You got shot.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.182
Did that happen protecting us?

22:30.266 --> 22:31.358
I said don't worry about it.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.610
Well, no wonder you were so pissed.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.813
I wasn't pissed.

22:36.814 --> 22:40.819
I was trained to be the whole solution.
To eliminate variables.

22:42.444 --> 22:45.448
And today, they keep adding up.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.246
We're turning.

22:48.325 --> 22:51.169
We've entered restricted airspace,
so we have to follow certain flight paths.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.288
It's regulation.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.999
This plane is capable
of fully automated flight,

22:55.124 --> 22:56.717
but May has to be
on the stick herself tonight.

22:57.459 --> 23:00.008
You've got an S.O.,
May's got to be on the stick.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.719
Lots of good lingo on this plane.

23:02.798 --> 23:03.970
Yeah.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.686
And we just
can't seem to understand each other.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.977
First walkie-talkie wristwatch.
1936, Poland.

23:15.144 --> 23:17.897
They only made 20, I think. Still works.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.325
I forgot you're such a sentimentalist,
Phillip.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.578
Romanticizing history.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.498
Yeah, most of it's glued down.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.581
There was an elegance
to things back then.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.078
There we agree.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.381
With everything around us
changing so quickly,

23:36.498 --> 23:40.002
it doesn't hurt
to have a few touchstones to the past.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.008
Reminds me of what's important.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.886
The last thing I want to do
is relive days gone by.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.760
- A few nights, maybe.

23:49.219 --> 23:50.516
I see what you're doing.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.228
I am reminiscing.

23:53.849 --> 23:57.649
This plane is such a step up
from the RV we used to work out of

23:57.728 --> 23:59.480
when you were stationed in Cuzco.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.236
I don't remember much working.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.532
I also don't remember you
being this direct.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.049
Skye, hand me the bottle.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.720
Okay, Turbo.
But you're still nursing the one you got.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.431
I'm not the only one.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.853
We're stuck above the clouds
for the next few hours.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.900
We might as well enjoy ourselves.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.779
We could make a few more memories
to add to your collection.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.614
What do you think?

24:43.649 --> 24:46.528
I think Ward already knows

24:46.610 --> 24:50.114
you'll have to eliminate May
from the equation to have a chance.

24:50.239 --> 24:53.743
Which gives him about 20 seconds
to get to her first.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.204
Ahh!

25:31.363 --> 25:34.367
We were allies. We had history.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.878
When did you decide
to throw that away?

25:37.953 --> 25:40.047
As soon as I saw your team.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.986
The reason I'm still alive
is because you need me

26:03.062 --> 26:06.657
to verify the change of routes for your
pilot when HQ calls in any minute now.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.241
I'd appreciate that.

26:08.317 --> 26:11.742
But if I don't, S.H.I.E.L.D. will
shoot this aircraft out of the sky.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.289
That'll take the 084 out of your hands.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.832
Maybe I should let them.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.206
No, I think you'll make the call.

26:18.327 --> 26:21.501
You already handed me your plane
for the life of one of your little lab rats.

26:21.997 --> 26:25.046
If I open the cargo hold,
you lose them all.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.919
And you are such a sentimentalist.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.512
This is my fault.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.185
Should've learned kung fu.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.553
Oh, yeah,

26:36.637 --> 26:39.060
but I shouldn't have pushed you
into the field in the first place.

26:39.848 --> 26:40.940
You weren't ready.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.233
It was my job
to make a proper threat assessment.

26:42.351 --> 26:43.398
"We." We weren't ready.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.613
This couldn't have happened
if Agent May wasn't on the stick.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.361
She would have busted out
some of her ninja knowhow.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.777
Agent May? No, no, no,
she transferred from administration.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.531
Well, I've seen her destroy a guy, so...

26:59.785 --> 27:02.004
You've heard of The Cavalry?

27:02.079 --> 27:03.296
- Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:03.372 --> 27:06.251
Well, everyone
at the Academy talks about...

27:06.375 --> 27:08.252
- She's The Cavalry!
-She's The Cavalry!

27:08.377 --> 27:11.347
I told you never to call me that.

27:11.421 --> 27:14.265
I can't believe it.
We're sure to get out of here now.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.976
How do we get out of here?

27:18.053 --> 27:19.930
We can't go through the doors.

27:20.222 --> 27:23.066
They're bolted,
tied to the pressurization lines.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.735
You two geniuses have nothing?

27:26.937 --> 27:29.565
Yeah, well, it's hard to concentrate
in these intense situations.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.652
Hey. Don't freeze up. Take a breath.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.571
You don't need to come up
with the whole solution.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.494
Just part of it. Right?

27:39.491 --> 27:40.834
Yeah.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.245
Pieces solving a puzzle.

27:45.247 --> 27:46.669
You knew
this was a weapon all along.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.672
But you got to it first.
I had to play nice.

27:50.127 --> 27:53.097
Yes, Coulson, for once,
I'm actually ahead of you.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.551
My country commissioned
that weapon decades ago.

27:56.633 --> 27:59.307
After the fall of HYDRA,

27:59.428 --> 28:02.728
many scientists followed their Nazi
friends to hide in this side of the world.

28:02.806 --> 28:03.853
German engineering.

28:03.932 --> 28:07.277
The weapon was lost
during a clash in the jungle. Until today.

28:08.103 --> 28:11.949
With it, we'll end the rebel uprising
and finally stabilize my country.

28:12.316 --> 28:13.613
You mean rule your country.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.076
You stay in your borders,
I'll stay in mine.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.702
Those borders are disappearing.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.909
Aliens descended on New York,
remember?

28:21.992 --> 28:24.962
They don't care whose colors you wear,
they just care who's in the way.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.627
We should be working together,
not fighting.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.583
Well, that's clearly the worst idea
we've heard yet.

28:29.666 --> 28:30.713
But it could work.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.841
Reyes is going to kill us the minute
we land, regardless. Blame it on rebels.

28:33.962 --> 28:36.841
This way, we have a fighting chance.
I'll take it.

28:36.924 --> 28:37.891
What's first?

28:37.966 --> 28:39.718
We can't get upstairs
without going in the lab.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.803
And the only way to release
the lab doors is from upstairs.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.514
The first thing is we're tied
to the cargo doors.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.190
- So unless you can...

28:45.390 --> 28:47.142
What the hell was that?

28:47.893 --> 28:49.190
Her wrist.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.566
Aah!

28:59.238 --> 29:00.490
What's next?

29:02.658 --> 29:04.911
Was it 11 years ago now?

29:04.993 --> 29:08.793
You swooped in with S.H.I.E.L.D. with
so much confidence, so much mystery.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.341
You had 100 men at your disposal.
And now...

29:11.416 --> 29:14.886
A hand-picked team.
And, yes, they're that good.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.847
Phil, you're not even aware.

29:17.923 --> 29:21.678
You're renewed idealism, your
collectibles, your airborne man-cave.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.513
Surrounding yourself
with young, attractive agents.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.183
You're having a mid-life crisis.

29:27.557 --> 29:29.935
More an after-life thing, really.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.488
And I'm not going to even mention
the red Corvette.

29:33.563 --> 29:34.985
Her name's Lola.

29:35.065 --> 29:37.443
Of course it is.
It's textbook.

29:38.235 --> 29:41.830
You built this team so you could
feel relevant, to feel needed.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.202
They don't need me.

29:43.865 --> 29:44.866
They need time.

29:45.242 --> 29:47.540
Well, time is not on their side.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.872
No,
but you gave them something better.

29:50.414 --> 29:51.916
A common enemy.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.134
Okay, we're sure, right?
Everyone sure'?

29:54.209 --> 29:55.836
- We're all on board.
-Yeah, let's do this fast.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.262
No turning back. No freezing up.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.756
Because if we do, then...

29:58.880 --> 30:00.757
- All of us die.
-We know.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.344
All right.

30:05.262 --> 30:06.980
You guys talk a lot.

30:50.932 --> 30:53.105
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616,
we have radar contact.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.359
Requesting confirmation
on a change in course. Over.

30:58.106 --> 31:01.701
Answer it or they all learn
what a 30,000-foot drop feels like.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.700
Agent Coulson, are you there?

31:04.112 --> 31:05.534
You have course confirmation.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.708
You are cleared
direct to the Slingshot.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.884
Agent Coulson,
everything all right up there?

31:17.959 --> 31:20.633
We heard you had
a little dustup on the ground.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.889
Yeah, we're all good.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.977
It's gonna be blue skies
from here on out.

31:27.803 --> 31:28.975
Simmons?

31:29.638 --> 31:31.311
Forget what I said before.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.936
This is the moment that we'll regret.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.405
Aah!

31:49.825 --> 31:51.793
Aah!

31:57.040 --> 31:58.041
It worked.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.502
The drop in cabin pressure
released the doors.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.803
I'll take care of the soldiers,
you guys get to the 084.

32:01.878 --> 32:02.879
And Coulson?

32:03.004 --> 32:05.006
Let's hope he can handle himself.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.388
--Aah!

32:07.926 --> 32:08.927
Aah!

32:12.722 --> 32:13.848
Get back!

32:27.696 --> 32:29.790
Go now! Find the 084!

32:38.206 --> 32:39.924
Help! Help!

32:48.216 --> 32:49.263
Coulson!

32:49.634 --> 32:50.726
Got you!

32:53.555 --> 32:54.727
Hold on!

32:57.017 --> 32:58.018
It's okay.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.368
I've got it! Fitz!

33:06.443 --> 33:09.037
We got it, reel us back in!

33:09.112 --> 33:10.785
I've got you!

33:15.785 --> 33:17.879
What are you doing?
We need your help.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.331
Trust me.

33:30.592 --> 33:33.687
Don't want you to know
what a 30,000-foot drop feels like.

33:34.930 --> 33:35.931
Aah!

34:16.972 --> 34:18.224
Cut him loose.

34:24.478 --> 34:25.981
- Sorry!
-Sorry, Ward!

34:31.902 --> 34:32.904
Hold on!

34:35.031 --> 34:36.032
Aah!

35:08.857 --> 35:10.734
I read the safety pamphlet.

35:10.859 --> 35:12.202
I think you might be the first.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.368
No other way in, huh?

35:18.033 --> 35:20.877
I was just starting
to warm up to this place.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.171
The 084 is cooling and stable.

35:27.250 --> 35:31.380
But we should call HQ and get it
to The Slingshot as soon as possible.

35:36.301 --> 35:39.271
I told you they were good.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.827
Make sure that track is clear
before you seal it in.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.329
All right.
Got some packing materials, still.

36:00.575 --> 36:01.747
Meet you up top.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.589
Not a scratch. But your plane's totaled.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.667
I hope S.H.I.E.L.D. insurance
covers hijackings.

36:08.750 --> 36:09.876
Sure.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.169
Under "incidentals."

36:12.671 --> 36:14.594
What exactly am I signing up for?

36:15.090 --> 36:18.640
Like I said. Front row seat
to the craziest show on Earth.

36:18.802 --> 36:21.601
Yeah, but I didn't expect the show
to get this crazy this fast,

36:21.680 --> 36:24.684
all for an object
you're just gonna destroy.

36:24.766 --> 36:26.018
Slingshot is protocol.

36:26.101 --> 36:29.651
A weapon like the 084 is too dangerous
for any person or country to have.

36:29.771 --> 36:32.274
People like Reyes
would always be after it.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.030
What happened with Reyes anyway?

36:34.109 --> 36:36.612
She's being held at a S.H.I.E.L.D.
detainment facility.

36:36.695 --> 36:40.290
I expect the Peruvian government
will negotiate for her release.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.242
She probably won't spend
much time in jail.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.293
No, I mean what happened
with you and Reyes'?

36:44.369 --> 36:47.122
You guys totally did it
back in the day, right?

36:48.623 --> 36:50.546
That's classified.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.176
Looks like Skye might end up
as more than just a consultant.

36:55.296 --> 36:57.173
Despite her reservations.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.270
You know,
she could turn into a solid asset.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.143
With some serious work.

37:05.014 --> 37:09.235
Well, if she wants to be a field agent,
she'll need a supervising officer.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.522
Someone disciplined, someone good.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.322
All right. I'll do it.

37:24.659 --> 37:28.755
Just to clarify,
you were talking about me, right?

37:30.331 --> 37:33.084
- We blew up a plane.
- I had a new experience.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.340
Eat that, Professor Vaughn.

37:34.419 --> 37:37.844
You had a new experience.
But it was new for all of us.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.682
They're happy.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.681
Hey, come on.
You guys don't want to miss this.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.853
Where is it?

37:46.181 --> 37:49.025
So it'll take about 180 days
to reach the Sun.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.818
Now, yes, of course,
it would've been faster

37:50.894 --> 37:53.898
if they used hydrogen-fuelled APU's,
but they're having fun.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.024
How many of those have you guys had?

37:57.609 --> 38:01.284
Skye, it's important when in the field
to unwind from time to time.

38:01.863 --> 38:03.957
Yeah, especially after a hard day
of everyone almost dying.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.622
Which doesn't happen every day, right?

38:06.701 --> 38:10.877
It's an anomaly. An irregularity.
Not the norm.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.041
Speaking of not the norm,

38:13.124 --> 38:15.047
whose idea was it
to blow a hole in the plane?

38:18.588 --> 38:22.138
May said that the doors were tied to
the pressurization, so I thought...

38:22.217 --> 38:25.562
So we thought
it was the only way to release them.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.813
It was everyone's idea, sir.

38:27.889 --> 38:29.391
Yeah, it was quite genius really.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.067
Nice work.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.195
All clear for liftoff.

38:34.270 --> 38:36.022
Time for blastoff.

38:36.105 --> 38:39.405
- Launching in three, two...

38:43.738 --> 38:45.991
The trajectory will take it
beyond the Lagrange Points

38:46.074 --> 38:47.326
so that it doesn't hit Herschel.

38:47.408 --> 38:49.410
Yeah, and there haven't
been any coronal mass ejections,

38:49.494 --> 38:51.246
so it shouldn't lose telemetry.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.832
Guys, English.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.088
Ow.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.884
Really? Really, Coulson?

39:45.884 --> 39:47.431
Six days?

39:47.510 --> 39:48.978
It only took you six days

39:49.053 --> 39:52.023
to take a completely renovated piece
of state-of-the-art machinery,

39:52.140 --> 39:54.017
and turn it into scrap?

39:54.475 --> 39:56.148
My team acted with my authority.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.150
Don't talk to me about authority.

39:58.855 --> 40:02.075
Do you know how much this plane cost?

40:02.525 --> 40:03.651
It's got a bar.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.829
A really nice one.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.870
Talking to me about authority.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.996
You know, I have the authority
to downgrade your ass to a Winnebago.

40:14.495 --> 40:15.712
I'm aware of that, sir.

40:15.830 --> 40:19.380
Well, I want it fixed just like you found it.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.502
So don't have Fitz-Simmons
going making modifications

40:21.586 --> 40:24.089
like a damn fish tank.

40:24.672 --> 40:25.673
Yes, sir.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.261
And the new girl,

40:29.344 --> 40:30.436
she's a risk.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.101
I know, sir.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.057
You know, sir?

40:36.184 --> 40:37.686
How's Lola?

40:37.894 --> 40:39.146
She's fine, sir.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.320
Thanks for asking.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.524
Talking to me about authority.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.075
Yeah, we're gonna
have to kill the fish tank.
