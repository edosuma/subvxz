00:56.800 --> 01:00.800
<i>The war had all but ground to a halt
in the blink of an eye.</i>

01:03.200 --> 01:07.500
<i>Lucian, the most feared and ruthless
leader ever to rule the lycan clan...</i>

01:07.800 --> 01:10.300
<i>...had finally been killed.</i>

01:12.700 --> 01:14.700
<i>The lycan horde
scattered to the wind...</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:18.500
<i>...in a single evening
of flame and retribution.</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:25.900
<i>Victory, it seemed, was in our grasp...</i>

01:26.000 --> 01:28.900
<i>...the very birthright of the vampires.</i>

01:33.500 --> 01:36.100
<i>Nearly six centuries had passed
since that night.</i>

01:37.000 --> 01:41.700
<i>Yet the ancient feud proved unwilling
to follow Lucian to the grave.</i>

01:42.500 --> 01:44.800
<i>Though lycans were
fewer in number...</i>

01:45.000 --> 01:47.300
<i>...the war itself had become
more perilous.</i>

01:47.400 --> 01:50.500
<i>For the moon no longer
held her sway.</i>

01:51.200 --> 01:56.200
<i>Older, more powerful lycans
were now able to change at will.</i>

01:57.000 --> 02:00.700
<i>The weapons had evolved,
but our orders remained the same:</i>

02:01.000 --> 02:04.800
<i>Hunt them down and kill them off,
one by one.</i>

02:06.100 --> 02:09.100
<i>A most successful campaign.</i>

02:09.100 --> 02:12.000
<i>Perhaps too successful.</i>

02:22.300 --> 02:25.200
<i>For those like me, a death dealer...</i>

02:25.600 --> 02:28.200
<i>...this signaled the end of an era.</i>

02:28.600 --> 02:30.900
<i>Like the weapons
of the previous century...</i>

02:31.300 --> 02:34.300
<i>...we, too, would become obsolete.</i>

02:34.300 --> 02:37.200
<i>Pity, because I lived for it.</i>

04:22.700 --> 04:24.000
Bloods!

05:47.200 --> 05:50.200
It's all right. It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.800
You're acting like a pack
of rabid dogs!

11:25.600 --> 11:28.600
And that, gentlemen...

11:28.600 --> 11:30.500
...simply will not do.

11:30.600 --> 11:34.900
Not if you expect to defeat
the vampires on their own ground.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.300
Not if you expect to survive at all.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.300
Pierce! Taylor!

11:44.600 --> 11:46.300
Put some clothes on, will you?

12:27.100 --> 12:28.600
We have a serious problem.

12:44.100 --> 12:45.800
I'll have to run a few tests.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.900
It's definitely an irradiated fluid
of some sort.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.700
Ultraviolet ammunition.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.800
Daylight, harnessed as a weapon.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.100
You expect me to believe
that a mangy animal...

12:56.600 --> 12:59.600
...came up with a bullet specifically
engineered to kill vampires?

12:59.700 --> 13:01.400
No, I'm betting it's military.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.600
Something they stole.
Some sort of high-tech tracer round.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.100
I don't care where
they got these things.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.000
Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel
could still be out there.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.600
Let's gather the death dealers
and go back.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.600
Absolutely not. Not now.
Not for a random incursion.

13:16.100 --> 13:20.100
The awakening is a few days off,
and this house is in unrest as it is.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.700
Random? They opened fire on us
in full view of the public.

13:24.100 --> 13:28.200
- And from what I heard in that tunnel...
- you said you didn't see anything.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.100
I know what I heard,
and I know what my gut tells me.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.500
There could be dozens
of lycans down there.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.600
Who knows, maybe more. Hundreds.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.700
We've hunted them
to the brink of extinction.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.800
Kraven's right, Selene.

13:43.100 --> 13:46.100
There's not been a den
of that magnitude for centuries.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.300
- Not since the days of Lucian.
- I know that, Kahn.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.900
But I'd rather you prove me wrong
by checking it out.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.500
Have your men tighten things up.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.800
I'll have Soren assemble
a search team.

13:58.200 --> 14:03.500
- No, I want to lead the team myself.
- Absolutely not! Soren will handle it.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.400
Hundreds, really?

14:07.200 --> 14:08.500
Viktor would believe me.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.400
- I'd never treat you like that.
- Of course not.

14:16.700 --> 14:21.700
Now run along and make sure she's
dressed and ready for her guests.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.200
- It's a waste of time, you know.
- What is?

15:34.200 --> 15:38.300
I doubt Viktor would want you freezing
in here, staring at his tomb for hours.

15:38.800 --> 15:43.400
No, he'd want the death dealers out
there, scouring every inch of the city.

15:43.800 --> 15:48.100
Kraven. I'll never understand
why Viktor left him in charge.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.700
He's a bureaucrat, not a warrior.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.100
We need to get you ready.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.500
- For what?
- The party.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.400
Amelia's envoy will be here
any minute.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.100
Oh, yes.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.300
You should definitely wear this one.
It's perfect.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.700
They were after you.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.300
He's attractive...

17:38.500 --> 17:40.800
...for a human.
- Who's attractive?

17:54.900 --> 17:57.300
I planned to have you
at my side this evening.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.800
Take Erika.
She's dying to be at your side.

18:02.400 --> 18:07.000
If you ask me, you take this warrior
business far too seriously.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.700
You can't undo the past,
no matter how many you kill.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.300
And besides...

18:15.400 --> 18:17.500
...what's the point
in being immortal...

18:17.900 --> 18:20.400
...if you deny yourself
life's simple pleasures?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.400
Do you see this human?

18:23.500 --> 18:26.500
- What of him?
- I'm beginning to think the lycans...

18:26.500 --> 18:28.000
Blast!

18:33.500 --> 18:35.900
Put on something elegant
and be quick about it.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.400
Kraven, I'm serious.
I think they were following him.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.300
Other than food,
why would lycans stalk a human?

19:59.300 --> 20:00.700
Any progress?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.200
Let's find out.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.900
Negative.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.400
You heading home?

20:31.200 --> 20:33.900
Yeah, Nicholas gave me
a couple hours off.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.900
By the way...

20:36.300 --> 20:39.500
...he said you did a terrific job
tonight with the surgery.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.200
Yeah.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.900
Take it easy.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.500
We were ambushed.

21:43.700 --> 21:45.300
Death dealers, three of them.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.100
- And the candidate?
- We lost him.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.100
You lost him?

21:51.500 --> 21:53.100
Look at this mess.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.300
Ag rounds. High content.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.600
Prevented him from
making the change.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.100
No use in digging out the rest.
Silver's penetrated his organs.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.100
Regeneration's impossible
at this point.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.600
Let's take these out.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.700
Relax.

22:26.200 --> 22:30.700
The vampires didn't realize
you were following a human...

22:31.200 --> 22:34.000
...did they, raze?
- No.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.600
I mean, I don't think so.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.500
- You don't think, or you don't know?
- I'm not sure.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.800
Negative.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.800
I really must have a look
at this Michael.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.300
Must I do everything myself?

23:20.000 --> 23:25.500
Our noble houses may be
separated by a great ocean...

23:25.500 --> 23:30.500
...but we are equally committed
to the survival of the bloodlines.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.500
And when Amelia arrives
to awaken Marcus...

23:34.000 --> 23:37.100
...in just two days' time...

23:37.500 --> 23:42.000
...we shall once again
be united as a single coven!

23:45.500 --> 23:50.200
We want to thank our hosts
for their generous hospitality.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.400
<i>He comes in, he does his job
and then he goes home.</i>

24:55.500 --> 24:58.500
<i>Other than that,
I don't know what to tell you.</i>

24:58.900 --> 25:02.000
<i>Interns work around the clock.
We don't have much of a life.</i>

25:02.300 --> 25:04.600
You know where we can find him?

25:04.900 --> 25:06.200
No.

25:06.900 --> 25:10.900
You can try him at home,
or you'll have to wait till he gets back.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.100
He's not in some kind
of trouble, is he?

26:00.700 --> 26:04.400
<i>This is Michael. I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message.</i>

26:04.700 --> 26:08.500
<i>Michael, it's Adam. The police were
just in the hospital looking for you.</i>

26:08.700 --> 26:11.600
<i>They were convinced you were
involved with a shootout.</i>

26:11.700 --> 26:14.700
<i>I told them there's no way
you'd be involved with that...</i>

26:14.700 --> 26:16.900
<i>...but they're looking for you.
Right now.</i>

26:21.300 --> 26:23.000
Why are they after you?

26:47.200 --> 26:48.700
Shit!

27:35.300 --> 27:36.600
Hello, Michael.

29:04.700 --> 29:06.200
What the fuck is going on?

30:50.800 --> 30:52.600
Stop the car.

30:54.800 --> 30:55.900
Stop the car!

30:56.300 --> 30:57.800
Back off!

30:57.800 --> 30:59.200
Okay.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.500
Okay.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.500
All right.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.300
But you've lost a lot of blood.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.400
If you don't stop the car,
you'll get us both killed.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.300
- I'm not screwing around!
- Neither am I!

31:18.500 --> 31:20.300
Shut up and hold on.
I'll be fine.

31:25.900 --> 31:27.000
Shit!

33:08.300 --> 33:11.200
A second escape. Impressive.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.800
Perhaps raze wasn't
overstating matters.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.400
Raze didn't bring back this.

33:28.300 --> 33:32.000
If Michael is indeed the carrier,
the vampires could...

33:32.300 --> 33:34.900
relax, old friend.

33:35.300 --> 33:37.000
I've tasted his flesh.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.900
Just two days till full moon.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.900
Soon, he will be a lycan.

33:44.300 --> 33:47.400
Soon, he will come looking for us.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.900
It's a shame we don't have more.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.500
Positive.

35:13.300 --> 35:16.600
Lay still. Your skull's
taken a good knock.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.700
You've been unconscious
for a while.

35:20.800 --> 35:24.500
Do you have any idea
why those men were after you?

35:24.800 --> 35:26.500
Where am I?

35:27.300 --> 35:29.000
You're safe.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.200
I'm Selene.

35:47.300 --> 35:50.300
So, for once, the rumors were true.

35:53.300 --> 35:58.000
The whole house has been absolutely
buzzing about your new pet.

36:00.300 --> 36:05.100
- Are you going to try to turn him?
- Of course not.

36:05.300 --> 36:08.000
So why did you bring him here?

36:10.300 --> 36:11.700
He saved my life.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.000
- Why are you here?
- Kraven sent me.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.100
He wants to see you. Now.

36:22.800 --> 36:25.200
This is completely unacceptable!

36:26.800 --> 36:30.400
You go against my orders and spend
the night away from the mansion...

36:30.800 --> 36:34.300
...with a human? A human you've
since brought back to my house.

36:34.300 --> 36:38.500
As far as I'm concerned,
this is still Viktor's house.

36:40.300 --> 36:42.200
Look, I don't want to argue.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.400
Understand that Michael is somehow
important to the lycans...

36:45.500 --> 36:48.400
- so now it's "Michael"!
- Would you just hear me out?

36:48.800 --> 36:52.400
It's beyond me why you're so
obsessed over this ridiculous theory.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.800
Lucian wouldn't be a bit
interested in a human...

36:55.300 --> 36:57.900
...Michael or otherwise.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.100
Wait a minute.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.900
You're infatuated with him,
aren't you?

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Now, that's a ridiculous theory.

37:08.600 --> 37:09.900
Is it?

38:34.200 --> 38:36.400
Leave us!

39:10.400 --> 39:13.000
I sure hope you never get
pissed off with me.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.100
Hold on.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.600
Check this out.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.300
Go ahead. Squeeze off a few.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.200
Eject the mag.

39:44.500 --> 39:48.300
You've copied the lycan rounds.
Silver nitrate.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.700
A lethal dose.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.500
They won't dig these out,
like our usual rounds.

39:52.500 --> 39:56.000
Straight into the bloodstream.
Ain't nothing to dig out.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.300
Tell me, Kahn.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.300
Do you believe Lucian died
the way they say?

40:05.300 --> 40:08.600
- Kraven telling war stories again?
- That's my point.

40:08.800 --> 40:12.000
It's nothing but an ancient story.
His story.

40:12.300 --> 40:15.500
There's not a shred of proof
he killed Lucian, only his word.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.700
I've never underestimated
Kraven's lust for advancement...

40:18.800 --> 40:21.700
...but Viktor believed him
and that's all that matters.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.700
- Where you going with this anyway?
- Nowhere.

40:46.500 --> 40:49.900
Engaging death dealers in public
and chasing after some human...

40:50.000 --> 40:54.200
...was not what I had in mind. You
were told to set up shop and lay low!

40:54.500 --> 40:57.600
Calm yourself, Kraven!

40:59.500 --> 41:03.300
The human doesn't concern you.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.200
And besides, I've laid low
for quite long enough.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.500
Just keep your men at bay, Lucian.

41:22.500 --> 41:24.400
At least for the time being.

41:24.500 --> 41:28.800
Don't force me to regret
our arrangement.

41:29.100 --> 41:31.600
You just concentrate on your part.

41:32.100 --> 41:36.300
Remember, I've bled for you
once already.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.200
Without me, you'd have nothing.

41:39.200 --> 41:42.400
You'd be nothing.

43:27.900 --> 43:31.300
<i>Of the scores of brave souls
who entered Lucian's fortress...</i>

43:31.400 --> 43:35.400
<i>...a single vampire survived:
Kraven...</i>

43:35.400 --> 43:39.200
<i>...who was richly rewarded
for not only setting the great blaze...</i>

43:39.600 --> 43:43.600
<i>...but for returning with evidence
of the lycan master's demise...</i>

43:43.700 --> 43:47.700
<i>...the branded skin,
cut from Lucian's very arm.</i>

44:16.300 --> 44:19.100
I've been looking for you.
He's been bitten.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.200
Your human,
he's been marked by a lycan.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.700
- Did Kraven put you up to this?
- No.

44:27.800 --> 44:31.300
I saw the wound with my own eyes,
I swear it.

44:33.800 --> 44:36.000
But what about the covenant?

44:36.000 --> 44:38.100
You know it's forbidden!

44:45.900 --> 44:48.700
And ever since he bit me,
I've been...

44:49.900 --> 44:54.300
I've been having these hallucinations
and these delusions.

44:56.400 --> 45:00.700
All I know is, it feels like
my skull is splitting in half.

45:00.900 --> 45:03.400
Okay, so a full-grown man bit you?

45:05.900 --> 45:07.900
Jesus.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.200
Are you sure this wasn't a dog?

45:10.200 --> 45:12.600
I said, it was a man.
It was a man.

45:12.700 --> 45:16.000
- Okay, I got it.
- He was after me.

45:16.200 --> 45:19.800
- And that woman from the subway...
- what woman?

45:20.700 --> 45:24.000
Haven't you been listening to me?
She took me hostage!

45:24.200 --> 45:25.700
All right.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.400
Just... please.

45:28.500 --> 45:32.300
I'll help you get this all sorted out,
all right? I'll be right back.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.500
Let go, Michael.

45:37.100 --> 45:38.600
Let go.

45:39.100 --> 45:43.200
Just calm down, okay?
I'm gonna be back in a minute.

45:43.600 --> 45:46.500
- That's a promise.
- All right.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.200
Please forgive me...

46:57.500 --> 47:00.400
...but I desperately need
your guidance.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.200
Kahn wants to see you.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.300
<i>To my knowledge...</i>

48:49.500 --> 48:54.000
<i>...an awakening has never been
attempted by one such as myself.</i>

48:54.500 --> 48:58.000
<i>The elders hold the power to organize
their memories and thoughts...</i>

48:58.000 --> 49:00.200
<i>...into a single, cohesive vision...</i>

49:00.500 --> 49:03.500
<i>...a detailed record of their reign.</i>

49:03.500 --> 49:07.400
<i>I can only hope Viktor
will hear my plea.</i>

50:16.800 --> 50:20.400
Please forgive me,
but I desperately need your guidance.

50:21.500 --> 50:24.600
I apologize for awakening you
ahead of schedule...

50:24.600 --> 50:27.100
...but I fear we may all be
in grave danger.

50:28.500 --> 50:32.100
Especially you, my lord,
if left in your weakened state.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.700
For I believe that Lucian
is alive and well.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.200
Here. Now. In this very city...

50:40.300 --> 50:43.500
...preparing to hit us
during the awakening ceremony.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.900
Even more disturbing...

50:48.200 --> 50:50.100
...is that if I'm correct...

50:51.200 --> 50:53.900
...it would mean that Kraven
is in league with him.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.400
What's so pressing?

52:18.900 --> 52:20.800
Take a look.

52:39.900 --> 52:41.600
Selene!

52:41.900 --> 52:43.900
<i>I want to speak with Selene!</i>

52:47.700 --> 52:49.500
Is that Michael?

52:49.700 --> 52:52.600
- Is it Michael?
- What the hell is going on?

52:52.700 --> 52:54.000
<i>What's happening to me?</i>

52:56.200 --> 52:57.200
<i>I'm coming out.</i>

52:58.700 --> 53:02.300
If you go to him, you'll never
be welcome in this house again.

53:05.700 --> 53:09.100
Now that Viktor's awake, we'll see
what he has to say about that.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.500
Get in.

53:49.500 --> 53:52.600
Look, I warned her. I warned her,
but she didn't listen.

53:52.600 --> 53:55.800
- I should've told you sooner.
- Told me what?

53:58.600 --> 54:00.900
Her human, Michael...

54:02.100 --> 54:04.500
...he's not a human at all.

54:04.600 --> 54:05.700
He's a lycan.

54:09.600 --> 54:11.000
What?

54:11.100 --> 54:14.700
What's this ruckus?

54:18.600 --> 54:21.100
Never come here again.
They'll kill you.

54:21.500 --> 54:24.500
Why? Who are you people?

55:08.800 --> 55:09.800
Leave us.

55:18.300 --> 55:23.000
Like it or not, you're in the middle
of a war that's raged for 1000 years.

55:23.300 --> 55:26.400
A blood feud between
vampires and lycans.

55:27.800 --> 55:28.900
Werewolves.

55:42.100 --> 55:43.400
Consider yourself lucky.

55:43.600 --> 55:46.800
Most humans die within an hour
of being bitten by an immortal.

55:47.100 --> 55:49.000
The viruses we transmit are deadly.

55:49.100 --> 55:52.300
And if you bit me,
I'd become a vampire instead?

55:52.600 --> 55:53.900
No, you'd die.

55:54.600 --> 55:57.900
No one's ever survived
a bite from both species.

55:58.100 --> 56:00.600
By rights, I'd stop the car
and kill you myself...

56:01.100 --> 56:03.000
- why are you helping me?
- I'm not.

56:03.100 --> 56:05.600
I track down and kill your kind.

56:05.600 --> 56:09.200
My only interest is finding out
why Lucian wants you so badly.

56:12.800 --> 56:15.800
Do you know why I've
been awakened, servant?

56:15.800 --> 56:17.600
No, my lord.

56:17.800 --> 56:21.200
- But I'll soon find out.
- You mean when you find her.

56:21.800 --> 56:25.300
- Yes, my lord.
- You must let her come to me.

56:26.300 --> 56:30.800
We have much to discuss,
Selene and I.

56:31.800 --> 56:37.200
She has shown me
a great many disturbing things.

56:37.300 --> 56:40.600
Things that will be dealt with
soon enough.

56:40.800 --> 56:44.700
This coven has grown weak,
decadent.

56:44.800 --> 56:50.100
Perhaps I should have left someone
else in charge of my affairs.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.700
Still...

56:57.300 --> 56:59.600
...her memories...

57:00.300 --> 57:02.800
...are chaotic.

57:04.300 --> 57:05.800
There's no sense of time.

57:05.800 --> 57:08.200
Please, my lord,
let me summon assistance.

57:08.300 --> 57:10.000
You're in need of rest.

57:10.800 --> 57:14.000
I've rested enough.

57:14.800 --> 57:17.800
What you will do
is summon Marcus.

57:21.200 --> 57:24.600
But he still slumbers, my lord.

57:26.200 --> 57:29.900
Amelia and the council members
are arriving tomorrow night...

57:30.200 --> 57:32.200
...to awaken Marcus.

57:32.700 --> 57:34.600
Not you, my lord.

57:34.700 --> 57:38.800
You've been awakened
a full century ahead of schedule.

57:47.600 --> 57:49.900
That bitch has betrayed me.

57:50.600 --> 57:54.400
Now he knows everything
she's been obsessing about.

57:58.200 --> 57:59.900
Wait.

58:05.200 --> 58:07.000
Are you to be trusted?

58:07.700 --> 58:09.600
Of course.

58:10.200 --> 58:12.200
Meet me in my quarters
in 20 minutes.

58:12.700 --> 58:15.700
It's time I filled you in
on a few things.

58:55.400 --> 58:59.300
I'm seeing these things,
these hallucinations.

58:59.900 --> 59:02.400
They're not hallucinations,
they're memories.

59:02.400 --> 59:06.200
You've been bitten. His memories
have been passed to you.

59:09.100 --> 59:14.500
This is one of the places we use
for interrogations. It should be safe.

59:29.700 --> 59:32.600
- Ziodex industries.
- We own it.

59:32.700 --> 59:35.500
First there was synthetic plasma,
now this.

59:35.700 --> 59:38.500
Once it's approved,
it should be our newest cash crop.

59:38.700 --> 59:40.600
It's cloned blood.

59:46.500 --> 59:47.700
What are these for?

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Lycans are allergic to silver.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.600
If we don't get our bullets out quickly,
they die during questioning.

59:56.400 --> 59:58.100
What do you do with them after?

59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.800
We put the bullets back in.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.400
- How are things progressing?
- We're ready.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.200
Why do you hate them so much?

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.300
I've already told you,
we're at war.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.400
So you're just following orders?

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.700
Why can't you just answer
the question?

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.900
Fine.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.800
Something was in the stable...

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.900
...tearing our horses to pieces.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.900
I couldn't have saved my mother.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.300
Or my sister.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.600
Their screams woke me.

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:11.200
My father died outside,
trying to fend them off.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.300
I stood at my door...

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.800
...about to run
to my nieces' room when...

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.100
twin girls.

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.800
Barely 6 years old.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.800
Butchered...

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:38.300
...like animals.
- Jesus christ.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.300
The next thing I knew,
I was in his arms.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.800
The war had spilled into our house.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.700
He'd been tracking the lycans
for days.

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.500
He drove them off and saved me.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.000
- Who?
- Viktor.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.200
The oldest and strongest of us.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.800
That night,
he made me a vampire.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:04.300
He gave me the strength
to avenge my family.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.100
Since then,
I've never looked back.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.000
I saw your pictures.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.200
Who is the woman? Your wife?

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.300
It may be wise to keep a closer eye
on our cousins.

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.500
I'll have raze see to it immediately.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:41.000
I'm afraid that I'm going to have
to place my faith in you, my friend.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:44.500
Time is running short.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.500
I tried to swerve,
but he hit us anyway.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.300
He sent us right into
the oncoming lane.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:59.200
When I came to...

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.200
...i realized that part of the engine
was in the front seat.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:10.600
And she was pinned there,
6 inches from me...

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.500
...in this horrible position.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.600
I think she was in shock
because she just...

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.100
...kept asking me over
and over again if I was all right.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.600
She was more worried about me.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.800
You know, if I knew then what
I know now, I could have saved her.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.000
There's no doubt in my mind
about that.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.200
But instead she died right there...

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.500
...about two minutes before
the ambulance arrived.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.900
After that, I didn't see any reason
to stick around.

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:04.300
I spent a summer here with my
grandfather when I was a kid so...

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:07.200
after I got my degree, I just...

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:09.600
i took off.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:17.300
I came over here to move on,
to forget.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.200
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.300
And have you?

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.100
Moved on?

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.600
Have you?

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:47.300
I need you to keep what I'm about to
tell you under the strictest confidence.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.600
It can wait.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:17.100
Who started the war?

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.600
They did.

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:22.700
Or at least that's what
we've been led to believe.

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.800
Digging into the past is forbidden.

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.800
I should be heading back.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.700
What about me?

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.600
Viktor will know what to do.
I'll come back.

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.400
- I won't stay alone.
- You will if you want to live.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.400
I want to go with you.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:58.800
What are you doing?

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.500
When the full moon
rises tomorrow...

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:08.400
...you will change, you will kill,
and you will feed.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.400
It's unavoidable.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.600
I can't leave you free
to roam around. I'm sorry.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:23.000
A single round won't kill you, but
silver prevents transformation.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.300
At least for a few hours.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:28.800
If I don't return in time,
do yourself a favor.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.200
Use it.

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.900
Yeah?

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.900
My lord. She's here.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:16.000
How could you do this to me?
Embarrass me like this?

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.899
The entire coven knows
that I had plans for us.

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.100
- There is no us!
- You'll go before Viktor...

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:28.800
...and tell him exactly what I tell you to!
From here on out, you'll do as I say.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.600
Is that in any way unclear?

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.399
Come closer, my child.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.100
Outside.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.000
Come on, move it.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.000
I've been lost without you, my lord.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.700
Constantly hounded by Kraven
and his never-ending infatuation.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:49.200
It is the oldest story in the book.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:54.500
He desires the one thing
he cannot have.

01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:59.400
Now, tell me...

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.700
...why have you come to believe
that Lucian still lives?

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.600
- Yeah.
- I've given you all the proof you need.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:13.800
Incoherent thoughts and images,
nothing more.

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.300
Which is precisely why the awakening
is performed by an elder.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.200
You do not possess
the necessary skills.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.200
But I did see Lucian. I shot him.
You must believe me.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.600
The chain has never been broken.
Not once.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.600
Not in 14 centuries.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:33.000
Not since we elders first began
to leapfrog through time.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.400
One awake, two asleep.
That's the way of it.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.600
It is Marcus' turn to reign,
not mine.

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:42.700
- There's been a complication.
- But I had no choice.

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.900
The coven is in danger,
and Michael is the key...

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.800
yes.

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:53.100
The lycan.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.400
Please.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.200
Give me the chance
to get proof you require.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.400
Fine.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.400
I will leave it to Kraven
to collect the proof...

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.500
...if there is any.

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.900
How could you trust him over me?

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.500
Because he is not the one who
has been tainted by an animal.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.800
I love you...

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.700
...like a daughter,
but you leave me with no choice.

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.900
These rules are in place
for a good reason...

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:37.200
...and they are the only reason
we have survived this long.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:45.400
You will not be shown
an ounce of leniency.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.400
When Amelia arrives, the council
will convene and decide your fate.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.100
You have broken the chain
and the covenant!

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.900
You must be judged!

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.200
You should've listened to me
and stayed out of this.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:30.000
Now you'll be lucky if I can convince
the council to spare your life.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.700
Tell me.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.500
Did you have the nerve to cut the skin
from his arm, or did Lucian do it?

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.700
Mark my words.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.900
Soon, you'll be
seeing things my way.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.500
No one opens this door.
Understood?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.100
I can't afford to have my future queen
run off with that lycan again.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.600
Shit.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.400
Change of plans. Amelia will be
picked up by Soren and his team.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.700
- That's our job.
- Not anymore.

01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:01.300
- Why are you helping me?
- I'm not. I'm helping me.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.900
- What's going on?
- The perimeter sensor's been tripped.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.400
We're locking down the mansion.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
It's Selene. She's escaped,
to go to him, to Michael.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.300
I want that lycan's head on a plate.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.400
We need to go.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.200
Get down!

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.900
Go. Go.

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.400
- Jump.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:38.100
- Any luck?
- False alarm.

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.500
The dogs would've been all over it
if anything had gotten near that fence.

01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:46.400
- Amelia should have arrived by now.
- Yes.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.900
Look, I want you to slip off the property
and find out what's keeping her.

01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.900
You've got it.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.700
Maybe we should pull over
and dose him.

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:40.700
Fuck him. He'll be all right.
We're almost there.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:50.400
Oh, shit. He's not gonna make it.
Pull over. Pull over!

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.700
Get the kit.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.100
Stick him. Stick him.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.100
My lord.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.100
Viktor wants to speak with you.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.600
My lord.

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.400
I sent for Selene...

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.800
...not you.

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:22.900
She's defied your orders...

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.700
...and fled the mansion, my lord.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:31.300
Your incompetence
is becoming most taxing.

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:35.200
It's not my fault.
She's become obsessed...

01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:38.700
...thinks that I'm at the core
of some ridiculous conspiracy.

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.300
And here's my proof.

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.500
Now, I want you to tell them
exactly what you told me.

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:09.300
All right, all right.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:16.300
We've been searching for someone
with a special trait.

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:20.400
A direct descendant
of Alexander Corvinus...

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.200
...hungarian, a warlord...

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.200
...who came to power in the early
seasons of the fifth century.

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:35.600
Just in time to watch a plague
ravage his village.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.800
He alone survived.

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:46.000
Somehow, his body
was able to change the disease...

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:50.000
...mold it to his benefit.

01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:55.300
He became the first true immortal.

01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:07.500
And years later,
he fathered at least two children...

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.000
...who inherited this same trait.

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:13.400
The sons of the Corvinus clan.

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:16.900
One bitten by bat, one by wolf...

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:22.500
...one to walk the lonely road
of mortality as a human.

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:28.100
- It's a ridiculous legend. Nothing!
- That may be...

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.500
...but our species
do have a common ancestor.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.800
A mutation of the original virus...

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.400
...is directly linked to his bloodline.

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:45.500
There is a descendant
of Corvinus lying there...

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:48.700
...not three feet from you.

01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:50.300
Yes.

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:56.200
But he's already a vampire.
We needed a pure source...

01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:02.300
...untainted. An exact duplicate
of the original virus...

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.600
<i>...which we learned...</i>

01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:09.500
<i>...was hidden away in the genetic
code of his human descendants...</i>

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:14.700
<i>...and passed along
in its latent form...</i>

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.500
<i>...down through the ages...</i>

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:23.500
<i>...all the way to Michael Corvin.</i>

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:29.600
For years, we tried to combine
their bloodlines.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.300
<i>And for years we failed.</i>

01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.800
<i>It was useless.</i>

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:44.800
Even at the cellular level, our species
seemed destined to destroy each other.

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:52.600
That is, until we found Michael.

01:28:55.700 --> 01:29:00.700
<i>The Corvinus strain allows
for a perfect union.</i>

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:06.500
A triple-celled platelet...

01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:12.600
...which holds unspeakable power.

01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:15.900
There can be no such union.

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:21.300
- And to speak of it is heresy.
- We'll see.

01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:27.200
Once Lucian has injected himself
with Michael's blood.

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:30.200
Lucian is dead.

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:32.700
According to whom?

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.200
I need you to do something for me.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.100
I can assure you, my child...

01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:58.000
...Kraven will pay with his life.

01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:23.000
Soon, this house will lie in ruins.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.600
- Not before you.
- No, wait. Wait.

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:29.200
You and you alone
will know the truth of this.

01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:38.300
If Lucian was able to get his hands
on the blood of a pure-born...

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:43.800
...a powerful elder like Amelia...

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:47.400
...or yourself...

01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:52.300
...and inject it along
with Michael's blood...

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:54.800
abomination.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:56.900
Half-vampire...

01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:01.500
...half-lycan, but stronger than both.

01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.100
I need to speak with Kahn.

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.400
My lord...

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:36.000
...the council members
have been assassinated.

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.900
- What of Amelia?
- They bled her dry.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:49.000
It has already begun.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.900
I'm sorry I doubted you.

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:08.700
Fear not, my child,
absolution will be yours...

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:15.500
...the moment you kill the descendant
of Corvinus, this...

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.700
...Michael.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.300
You've been given an enzyme
to stop the change.

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:04.000
It may take a little time
for the grogginess to dissipate.

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.200
That's enough!

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.900
Just go and see
what's keeping raze, will you?

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.500
I really must apologize.

01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:24.200
He's in desperate need
of a lesson in manners.

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:27.700
Speaking of manners,
where are mine? Forgive me.

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.300
I'm Lucian.

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.600
I need to go.

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.300
I need to get back.

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.600
There's no going back.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.700
There's no going anywhere.

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:50.100
The vampires will kill you on sight.
Just for being what you are.

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.000
One of us.

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:58.100
You are one of us.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:02.500
What are you doing?

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.800
- What are you doing?
- Bringing an end to this conflict.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.300
Your war, it has nothing
to do with me.

01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.700
My war?

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.600
No!

01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:45.500
No!

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.000
No!

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.500
No!

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.000
No! No!

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:40.300
Sonja!

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.100
They forced you to watch her die.

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:51.200
Sonja.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.500
That's what started the war.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.100
I saw it happen as if I were there.

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:09.400
We were slaves once.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:14.600
The daylight guardians
of the vampires.

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:19.000
I was born in servitude...

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.700
...yet I harbored them no ill will.

01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:27.800
I even took a vampire for my bride.

01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:30.800
It was forbidden...

01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:33.100
...our union.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:38.300
Viktor feared
a blending of the species.

01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:42.200
Feared it so much...

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:45.400
...he killed her.

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.500
His own daughter...

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:52.100
...burnt alive...

01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.900
...for loving me.

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:02.200
This is his war...

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.500
...Viktor's...

01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:09.100
...and he's spent the last 600 years...

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:13.100
...exterminating my species.

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:17.100
What are they gonna do to Selene?

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.300
We have company.

01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:26.700
- I thought we had a deal.
- Patience.

01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:30.400
Kraven.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.700
These are matters
to be discussed in private.

01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:39.600
Please escort our guests downstairs.

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.400
The council has been destroyed.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:02.300
Soon, you will have it all.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:08.400
Both great covens and an ironclad
peace treaty with the lycans.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.800
Who I trust will not be forgotten
when the spoils are tabulated.

01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:17.000
How do you expect me to assume
control now that Viktor's awake?

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.000
There's no defeating him.
He grows stronger as we speak.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.100
And that is precisely why
I need Michael.

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.800
If Viktor were so easy to dispatch...

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.500
...you'd have done it yourself
centuries ago.

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.700
Exit shaft! Move it!

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.300
Son of a bitch!

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.100
Oh, shit!

01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.400
It's Viktor.

01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:22.400
Yes.

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:26.000
And if you had done your job,
he'd still be in hibernation.

01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:34.200
Where the hell is raze?

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.400
Is there another way out?

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:45.700
I guess it didn't occur to you that you'll
have to bleed to pull off this coup.

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.800
Don't even think about leaving.

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:17.200
Silver nitrate.
Bet you weren't expecting that.

01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:29.700
Come on! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move!

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.900
Lucian.

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.400
Selene!

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:54.300
Selene!

01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:42.500
Not yet.

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:35.000
I have to get you out.
Viktor's on his way.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000
And he won't be satisfied
until every lycan's dead.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.600
They'll kill you too,
just for helping me.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.400
I know.

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.800
I know what started the war.

01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:21.000
That's enough.
You're coming with me!

01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:24.600
I hope I live to see
Viktor choke the life from you!

01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:26.600
I bet you do.

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:30.800
But let me tell you a little something
about your beloved dark father.

01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:34.600
He's the one who killed your family.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.900
Not the lycans.

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.500
Never could follow his own rules.

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:41.900
Said he couldn't abide the taste
of livestock.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.300
So every once in a while, he went out
and gorged himself on human blood.

01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:49.000
I kept his secrets...

01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:51.100
...cleaned up the mess.

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:53.500
But it was he...

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.200
...who crept room to room...

01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:58.900
...dispatching everyone
close to your heart.

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.700
But when he got to you...

01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:06.000
...he just couldn't bear the thought
of draining you dry.

01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:11.100
You, who reminded him so much
of his precious sonja...

01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:16.100
...the daughter
he condemned to death.

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:19.700
- Lies.
- Believe what you want.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.300
Now come on.

01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:24.900
Your place is by my side.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.900
So be it.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.300
Bite him!

01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:10.000
<i>Half-vampire...</i>

01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:11.800
<i>...half-lycan...</i>

01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:14.900
<i>...but stronger than both.</i>

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:43.400
What the hell are you doing?

01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:46.400
You may have killed me...

01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:48.900
...cousin.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.400
But my will...

01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:53.300
...is done regardless.

01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:35.300
Where is he?

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:37.700
Where's Kraven?

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:01.600
Forgive me, my child.

01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:04.600
It wasn't the lycans.

01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:08.500
It was you.

01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:17.600
Leave us.

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.600
How could you bear my trust...

01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:41.100
...knowing that you'd
killed my family?

01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:44.400
Yes.

01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:46.600
I have taken from you.

01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:51.300
But I have given so much more.

01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:57.400
Is it not a fair trade, the life I have
granted you? The gift of immortality?

01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:00.400
And the life of your daughter?

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:03.200
Your own flesh and blood?

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:26.800
I loved my daughter!

01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:31.500
But the abomination growing
in her womb...

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:34.300
...was a betrayal of me
and of the coven!

01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:43.500
I did what was necessary
to protect the species...

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:47.100
...as I am forced to do yet again.

01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:53.000
No!

02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:47.200
Time to die.

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:09.900
<i>Though I cannot predict the future...</i>

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:13.800
<i>...the consequences of tonight
will reverberate through the halls...</i>

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:16.900
<i>...of both great covens
for many years to come.</i>

02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:21.000
<i>Two vampire elders
have been slain...</i>

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:23.500
<i>...one by my own hand.</i>

02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:29.100
<i>Soon, Marcus will take the throne.</i>

02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:34.900
<i>And a tide of anger and retribution
will spill out into the night.</i>

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:39.400
<i>Differences will be set aside.</i>

02:05:40.300 --> 02:05:42.600
<i>Allegiances will be made.</i>

02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:44.300
<i>And soon...</i>

02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:47.400
<i>...I will become the hunted.</i>

02:05:48.305 --> 02:05:54.323
