WEBVTT

00:05.560 --> 00:07.680
Let the fun commence.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.920
'This is Ex on the Beach.'

00:14.880 --> 00:18.160
'Eight new unsuspecting singles
are looking for love.'

00:19.240 --> 00:22.120
'But what they don't know is...'
Fuck.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.120
'...there are more exes
than ever before.'

00:26.200 --> 00:28.880
My arse just fell out me shorts.
You cheated on me!

00:28.960 --> 00:30.920
Stop acting the fucking big man!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.880
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

00:33.960 --> 00:37.800
'And they're flying in
from everywhere.'

00:37.880 --> 00:39.880
(shouting, laughter)

00:42.360 --> 00:45.200
'Some exes want romance.'

00:45.280 --> 00:46.880
I do really, really love him.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.520
'Some want revenge.'

00:49.600 --> 00:51.960
(screaming)
Both of you, let go now!

00:52.040 --> 00:53.360
Let go now!

00:53.440 --> 00:55.560
No one fucking likes you!
See you later.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.720
'And others just want
to wreck the gaff.'

00:59.960 --> 01:01.560
Hey!
(clattering)

01:01.640 --> 01:04.800
Fuck! That'll be someone's
fucking head in a minute.

01:04.879 --> 01:08.320
'As always, the Tablet of Terror
is topping up the torment...'

01:08.400 --> 01:11.400
It's going to be fireworks.
'...causing misery...'

01:11.480 --> 01:13.040
(sobs)
What am I gonna do?

01:13.120 --> 01:15.200
You will never ever have me
ever again.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.440
'...mayhem...'
You fucking dickhead!

01:17.520 --> 01:20.520
(shouting)
'...and madness.'

01:20.600 --> 01:24.440
Oh!
'It's gonna get explosive.'

01:24.520 --> 01:26.040
Fucking what?!
Ooh!

01:26.120 --> 01:29.040
(shouting)
Fucking slag!

01:29.120 --> 01:31.680
'Ten exes have already arrived.'

01:31.760 --> 01:32.800
'But whose...'

01:32.880 --> 01:36.000
I hate her guts.
Slag, slag, slag, slag, slag.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.480
'...ex...'

01:37.560 --> 01:38.840
'...is...'

01:40.120 --> 01:41.520
'...next?'

01:41.600 --> 01:43.520
My heart is breaking.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.840
I've woken up
and Sean's not by my side.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.840
I feel devastated.
I feel like this is the end.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.680
I don't understand
why Zahida's so upset.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.160
I kissed Chanelle as a dare,
there should be no animosity.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.840
Fucking Chewbacca moron. I hate her.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.640
I'm really glad she's gone home.

02:27.720 --> 02:30.200
Morning.
Morning, campers.

02:30.280 --> 02:34.960
Woke up this morning, and I'm with
my new boyfriend, Ross.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.920
Yeah. (laughs)

02:40.000 --> 02:42.760
With Harriette and Ross
I ain't really bothered.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.280
I dunno if he's real or fake.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.720
Every little thing I do, Harriette
bites onto it straight away.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.280
So, if she's gonna keep biting,
I'm gonna keep casting.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.240
Everything's been building up.

03:00.320 --> 03:04.440
I came in here confident
and I've been knocked a few times.

03:09.280 --> 03:13.080
I put it all on a plate, which I
found out is the wrong thing to do.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.160
But that's who I am.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.560
I am quite an upfront,
brash girl, I get that.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.320
The issue is that's who I am.
I don't wanna change.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.760
This is making me wanna change,
this is knocking my confidence.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.680
For the first time in a long time
I just want to go home.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.120
I need to get my end away in here,
cos when I get out of here,

03:33.200 --> 03:36.640
my mates are gonna rip me
another arsehole.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.160
I'm gonna get
fucking terrorised, mate.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.400
I won't even sit
in the same room as my mam.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.840
I came in to have fun
and I haven't yet.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.200
I'd understand
where Becca's coming from,

03:51.280 --> 03:53.720
if she'd come in and hadn't
had sex with anyone,

03:53.800 --> 03:57.640
but she has shagged Jack, so why
is she trying to cock-block me?

03:57.720 --> 04:00.040
When it comes to Aaron,
he's not cracking on.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.040
I'm a jealous psychopath
and I'm not gonna allow it.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.640
Yeah.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.000
If a girl comes in today,
I'm gonna go for it.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.360
I'm single and I don't care if I
hurt you, I'm gonna do what I want.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.280
'After Chanelle's
explosive departure,

04:26.360 --> 04:29.480
Sean has decided
to distance himself from Zahida.'

04:31.040 --> 04:32.880
'By getting into bed with her.'

04:34.960 --> 04:37.680
Now we're coming towards the end
of the experience,

04:37.760 --> 04:41.480
I've gotta try and chill with
Zahida, cos I'm isolating myself.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.160
Why's he said, every single day,

04:50.240 --> 04:53.160
that he likes us and that he wants
to see us when we go home

04:53.240 --> 04:55.480
and now suddenly
he doesn't want to see us.

05:03.280 --> 05:07.440
I was clear from the start, if she
develops feelings, I'm not to blame.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.200
I dunno what I'm gonna do today
to make myself feel better.

05:17.280 --> 05:21.880
I'm gonna put my make up on, put on
a nice bikini, but I just wanna cry.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.600
'Zahida's sobbing over Sean,

05:27.680 --> 05:31.880
but who will be a gibbering wreck
when the next ex washes up?'

05:31.960 --> 05:34.880
'T minus two hours.'

05:37.880 --> 05:39.600
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

05:39.680 --> 05:41.880
(groaning)

05:43.320 --> 05:45.400
Everything is calm
in the villa for now,

05:45.480 --> 05:48.960
but no rest for the wicked,
because it's beach time for...

05:49.040 --> 05:51.720
...Aaron, Harriette and Josh.

05:51.800 --> 05:54.120
Fuck's sake.
Why's it fucking me again?

05:54.200 --> 05:57.200
I've got a feeling today
could be another shitty day.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.400
Hopefully I don't get
my lights punched out again.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.720
Fucking big man.
I reckon it's gonna be Marnie.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.080
It's hard to get my dick wet
with Becca here.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.080
If Marnie comes out,
it's gonna be impossible.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.840
I don't think it's Marnie, mate.
Swear down.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.840
You think it's my ex?
I think it's your ex, straight up.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.240
If I see my ex, I probably won't be
able to control my emotions

06:18.320 --> 06:21.160
and to be honest, I feel like
I've been through enough.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.920
I don't feel threatened,
we've committed.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.760
I think Ross should get
his boxing gloves out.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.280
I've got no competition.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.000
I've tried to be happy,
but I've been down.

06:39.080 --> 06:43.240
If, like, a guy came in now,
I wouldn't even try.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.480
I've been knocked back hundreds
of times by the boys in here.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.080
I dunno what's wrong.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.800
I know everyone,
even if they give you banter,

06:50.880 --> 06:52.600
they care, they like you.

06:52.680 --> 06:57.240
I love your company. I love
all your innuendos, it's funny.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.640
I like her, she's nice,
she's got a big heart.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.320
She deserves a good fucking.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.120
'Ah, how sweet.'

07:03.200 --> 07:05.800
You're good looking,
I know you think you're not.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.200
I thought I did, fuck me.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.240
This is what I mean,
like, you're you.

07:09.320 --> 07:12.280
If there's one thing
that's been real it's you.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.880
Yeah, and legit...

07:16.680 --> 07:18.720
(laughs)

07:18.800 --> 07:21.640
Right now, I actually
really wanna see a familiar face

07:21.720 --> 07:25.640
and for once in my life,
I'd welcome my ex with open arms.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.040
'And probably open legs.'

07:33.040 --> 07:35.720
(laughter)
I hate this shit.

07:35.800 --> 07:40.680
I'm nervous, cos, obviously,
the situation I've got myself in.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.800
As much as things have been mental
with me and Ross, I am happy.

07:44.880 --> 07:49.440
It's gonna take a lot more
than my ex to ruin how I feel now.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.320
I think I'm gonna shit myself.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.520
I have had no luck in this villa
with girls whatsoever.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.760
I'm hoping that it's one
of Aaron's rocket exes,

07:58.840 --> 08:00.560
then I can crack on with someone.

08:02.240 --> 08:05.200
God knows who the fuck
is gonna come on that beach.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.320
I'm just fucking praying
it isn't Marnie.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.840
There's been one guy who's taken
your ex to the penthouse,

08:11.920 --> 08:14.800
what if there was another guy?

08:14.880 --> 08:16.280
It's not gonna be nice.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.600
If Marnie comes out,
man's time is gonna be fucked.

08:40.039 --> 08:41.600
(laughs)

08:41.679 --> 08:45.160
I'm fucking so glad that it's her.
It coulda been ten times worse.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.560
How you doing?

08:46.640 --> 08:48.800
I've had a right shit time
with birds.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.560
Now it's an ex that is all good.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.680
See what happens, I might crack on.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.360
Aaron.
Nice to meet you.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.880
This girl walks out the water
and she is fucking fit.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.920
So, you're Josh's ex?
Yeah.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.640
What's your name?
Jenny.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.360
I'm Jenny, I'm from Bolton.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.960
You know me from being
the "High-class escort"

09:06.040 --> 09:08.200
that entertained Wayne Rooney.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.400
When I used to work
as a high-class escort,

09:11.480 --> 09:14.440
I didn't know how to tell
my mum and dad I was making money,

09:14.520 --> 09:16.800
so I'd tell them
I was glass collecting.

09:16.880 --> 09:20.280
That's a lot of glasses
to be collecting.

09:20.360 --> 09:24.400
Me and Josh were dating for about six
months, but it was really on/off.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.880
He was just the playboy
that I didn't need at the time.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.240
I'm coming to see Josh
to see if he's matured a bit

09:32.320 --> 09:34.520
and if has,
then maybe we can rekindle it.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.800
But if he's not,
then I'm ready to move on.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.160
When were you with Josh?
It was three or four months ago.

09:43.240 --> 09:46.400
Josh is a good lad, but let's be
honest, he's no competition.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.800
That's one more girl in the villa
I'm gonna try and bang.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.680
What exactly are your reasons
for coming?

09:52.760 --> 09:56.520
Obviously I'm here to see Josh.
If he's matured a bit, we'll see.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.800
So, you two are on a good level?
We're just pals, innit.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.480
There's no sexual chemistry?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.360
No, we're all right...

10:05.280 --> 10:07.240
(laughs)

10:07.320 --> 10:09.280
Get on all fours and start noshing.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.960
(laughs)

10:11.040 --> 10:13.840
Yeah, nah.
He's not really changed that much.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.640
I just don't think
he's matured too much yet.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.400
What is your type, babe?

10:20.480 --> 10:24.080
I like a nice body. Good banter,
gotta have good banter.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.240
Yeah, a few tats are all right.

10:27.520 --> 10:31.200
I'm buzzing with that, cos I'm gonna
step in and take her off his hands.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.360
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

10:35.560 --> 10:38.040
"Welcome to the beach, Jenny."

10:38.120 --> 10:42.080
"Aaron, it's time for you
to be going on a date with Jenny."

10:42.160 --> 10:43.800
Obviously, very attractive.

10:43.880 --> 10:47.360
So, I think we'll have a good date
and there'll be lots of banter.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.600
"Time to bounce some balls,
here's hoping you'll score."

10:52.920 --> 10:55.400
You know what?
I hope his date goes shit.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.400
So then she'll come back
and I can crack on.

10:58.480 --> 10:59.480
Are you OK, though?

10:59.560 --> 11:01.640
Yeah, amazing.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.360
We'll have a lot of drinks.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.280
I'm gonna take us chance
before she meets Becca

11:06.360 --> 11:08.440
and that evil thing
gets in her head.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.640
Have fun, guys!

11:11.720 --> 11:13.880
You all right?
Yeah, I'm chilled.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.200
Shock, I lost again. Pissed off.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.520
Yo, yo, what you sayin'?

11:30.600 --> 11:32.280
Who is it?
Who is it?

11:32.360 --> 11:34.040
One of his exes, another one.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.880
What, Josh's?
Jenny Thompson.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.480
She a bit of a go
with Wayne Rooney back in the day.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.920
Fuck off!
Aaron's gone on a date with her.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.720
She's, like, down to a T his type.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.840
She's got tattoos,
quite natural looking.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.880
Becca has cock-blocked Aaron
at every chance.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.080
I don't think
it'll happen with Jenny.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.080
It's one big game now
with me and Aaron.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.880
He's gonna be grafting
with this bird to piss me off.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.160
'Who? Aaron? Never.'

12:11.840 --> 12:14.960
Me and Jenny walk into the date
and it's beer pong with Raki.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.440
This is gonna get messy.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.000
Oh, don't.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.680
Oh, yes!

12:22.680 --> 12:24.360
You're necking it. (laughs)

12:24.440 --> 12:26.840
All I can think about
is jumping over the table

12:26.920 --> 12:28.760
and sticking the lips on Jenny.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.520
You gotta do it all.
(retches) I'm gonna be sick.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.400
The date's going well.
I find Aaron attractive.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.880
(spits)

12:42.080 --> 12:44.160
We're having fun,
we're having a laugh,

12:44.240 --> 12:46.160
so who knows
what it's gonna lead to?

12:48.080 --> 12:49.360
Cheers.
Cheers.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.800
Glad you're here?
I am.

12:50.880 --> 12:51.880
Are you single?

12:51.960 --> 12:54.120
I am single. Fully single.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.040
I feel like on this date
I've gotten on with Aaron.

12:57.120 --> 13:01.040
I've forgotten about Josh and I feel
there's no need to think about him.

13:03.560 --> 13:05.560
My ex was like, "I've come for you."

13:05.640 --> 13:07.760
Two days later,
she shagged another lad.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.920
I don't even wanna talk about her.
She's just another ex.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.440
Who the fuck is Becca?

13:12.520 --> 13:16.840
You're here, I'm here,
we're both single, so fuck Becca.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.120
You had a good date?

13:19.200 --> 13:22.120
I had an amazing date and I
am feeling on top of the world.

13:22.200 --> 13:26.400
I'll be honest, if you see what's
in my pants, it's a truncheon.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.840
Tonight's mint.
We're having a superhero party.

13:38.920 --> 13:42.920
I am Harriette The Drunken Bandit.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.080
I'm Maisie
and I'm the Woman of Steel.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.160
My fanny's getting
a little bit rusty.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.880
Right, Zahida,
I've got a superhero name for you,

13:53.960 --> 13:58.000
Zahida Attach, cos you attach
yourself to men that don't want you.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.440
How brutal is that? Prick.

14:01.520 --> 14:05.520
I was gonna give Becca a super name,
I'll still give my super name.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.840
The Ultimate Cock Blocker.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.000
(laughter)

14:10.080 --> 14:11.960
Josh is calling me the Cock Blocker,

14:12.040 --> 14:14.360
cos I'm stopping Aaron
getting any bed.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.440
Cheers, guys.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.320
Cheers.
(laughter)

14:18.920 --> 14:20.520
(cheering, laughter)

14:20.600 --> 14:23.440
I couldn't be happier
to walk in this villa with Jenny.

14:23.520 --> 14:27.800
She's a nice girl, but knowing it's
gonna annoy Becca is even better.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.680
Hello, how are you?

14:30.760 --> 14:32.960
Nah, I fucking
don't rate her at all.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.680
Becca is staring at me and I can
feel the tension across the table.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.280
It's really uncomfortable.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.520
How was your date
and what did you do?

14:46.600 --> 14:48.920
It was beer pong,
but in every cup was Raki.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.120
Did you neck on?

14:50.200 --> 14:53.240
There was more kissing than talking.
Mwah.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.080
Aaron's trying to piss me off, I can
tell, cos he keeps looking at me.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.400
It was nice to get out and have fun.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.560
I'm gutted about this situation,

15:01.640 --> 15:04.520
but I guess I'm gonna
have to move on to the next.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.760
Where do you stand now?
Obviously, you were with Frankie.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.560
Who you spooning tonight?
(wags tongue) Jenny.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.520
(laughter)

15:12.600 --> 15:16.080
Becca is massively fucked off, but
she hasn't got a leg to stand on.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.240
What's your type?
My type?

15:18.320 --> 15:20.840
If you was to pick someone
on this table...

15:20.920 --> 15:22.920
It would be Aaron.
It would be Aaron?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.280
Get your tongue
out of Aaron's arse, mate.

15:25.360 --> 15:29.360
You think I'm gonna let Jenny
and Aaron be happy? Not a chance.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.880
'Becca's feeling bitter,

15:33.960 --> 15:37.040
but who's next to leave
a sour taste in the villa?'

15:37.120 --> 15:39.800
'Whose ex is next?'

15:39.880 --> 15:41.920
(evil laugh)

15:43.240 --> 15:48.000
'With awkward introductions out
of the way, Jenny's being initiated

15:48.080 --> 15:49.600
with a harmless party game.'

15:49.680 --> 15:51.600
Fuck, marry, avoid.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.840
'Well, maybe not that harmless.'

15:53.920 --> 15:56.200
Right, Aaron.
I'd fuck Jenny.

15:56.280 --> 16:01.360
I'd marry Nicole, cos she's, like,
my best mate and I'd avoid... Becca.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.040
(laughter)

16:04.120 --> 16:06.160
Becca's reaction is priceless.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.280
Believe me, babe, you can fuck off.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.600
Right. Ross?

16:09.680 --> 16:12.080
Fuck Becca.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.320
Are you fucking serious?

16:14.400 --> 16:17.280
That's fucking arsehole behaviour.

16:17.360 --> 16:20.400
Marry Harriette. Avoid Jenny.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.560
There's nothing to argue.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.040
What you even on about?

16:30.120 --> 16:32.120
She is livid.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.040
She's a jealous little girl.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.640
Harriette, why you getting the hump?
I haven't.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.840
Why you getting the hump?
I haven't.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.360
You have.
(indistinct)

16:40.440 --> 16:44.360
Your head's fucked, you know?
My head's fucked?Yeah.

16:44.440 --> 16:47.840
It takes me about ten seconds
to get her to bite.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.960
He coulda said someone else.
Why you getting jealous for?

16:51.040 --> 16:52.920
It ain't about being jealous, babe!

16:53.000 --> 16:56.240
Nibble, nibble, got one on the end
of the fucking reel.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.680
You're being a cunt.
You're chatting shit.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.720
Since fucking Jack
walked on the beach

17:01.800 --> 17:07.520
he's been plotting and planning
to fuck everything for me.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.400
You don't want us to work out.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.520
You've been trying to get in my
knickers since we got here.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.400
Jack and Harriette have been rowing,
it's deja vu.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.280
Don't try and fuck my shit up.

17:17.359 --> 17:20.920
The thing is, babe,
I could end your life right now.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Believe it when I say.

17:23.079 --> 17:25.760
I ain't having that.
Who the fuck you talking to?

17:25.839 --> 17:28.600
See you, yeah?
You dirty, little sket.

17:28.680 --> 17:32.400
Don't fucking speak to her like that.
Don't speak to her like that.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.680
Jack, you're a cunt. You speak to
girls like shit all the time.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.000
Get off, you dumb cunt.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.360
Who you talking to, bruv?

17:40.440 --> 17:43.280
Big surprise,
Sean pops out the woodwork.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.520
Let's go for it. Let's go for it.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.920
Calm down, Karate Kid.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.880
I'm gonna have to bear hug you,
get you out of this situation.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.120
All right, let go of me.

17:53.200 --> 17:58.280
This whole fucking argument started
over snog, marry, avoid.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.760
Do you know what?
You're a fucking cunt, yeah.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.640
You're a fucking cunt!
You're a fucking cunt!

18:03.720 --> 18:06.480
This is what you want!
This is what you always wanted!

18:06.560 --> 18:09.720
I wanna kill him.
I wanna fucking kill him.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.160
You fuck my shit up,
cos you're not happy!

18:12.240 --> 18:13.240
Stop it.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.840
Cos you know I'm finally happy,
you fucking cunt.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.280
Girl's fucking cuckoo, man.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.600
Let me go!

18:21.680 --> 18:25.040
The only person in the wrong,
is the person going mental

18:25.120 --> 18:28.640
and getting in a state.
Me, chilled back and relaxed.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.200
Ross, grab your bird.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.640
You better pull her, mate.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.480
From the start it's been
Jack and Harriette arguing.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.080
I've sat and let it go on
and tried to support her,

18:39.160 --> 18:42.720
but this time, I've made her my
girlfriend and she's still rowing.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.440
How dare you try and fuck this?

18:45.520 --> 18:47.680
How dare you try and fuck this?

18:47.760 --> 18:50.640
I've got to the stage now
where I've reached my limit.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.840
Can I have my watch back?

19:00.440 --> 19:01.840
Don't do this.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.800
Don't give him this.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.200
I can't believe Ross
is falling for it.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.800
I thought you cared about me.
I fucking do and...

19:08.880 --> 19:11.040
I care about you!
Clearly fucking not.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.960
It's difficult for Ross seeing
Harriette at Jack all the time.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.480
I think Ross needs to fuck her off.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.520
You argue every night.
I thought you was gonna tell me...

19:20.600 --> 19:22.520
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.840
It's done.
It's done?

19:23.920 --> 19:25.760
Yeah, it's fucking done.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.040
No going back.

19:28.120 --> 19:32.680
Ross, you're giving him it!
Don't walk away from me.

19:33.880 --> 19:37.080
Ross, you know how much
I care about you.

19:37.160 --> 19:40.320
You've been everything to me
in this villa.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.920
And if you don't believe me...

19:44.200 --> 19:48.240
...then I'm gonna do everything
in my power to make sure you do.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.920
(weeps)

20:05.520 --> 20:09.040
Sean's been a massive hero
in the house, everyone can see that.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.000
It's making us want him more.

20:14.120 --> 20:17.760
This kick off with Jack has made me
realise with Zahida it is there.

20:27.080 --> 20:30.560
I'm starting to feel like she's the
only one in here I can turn to.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.280
I've got the keys to the penthouse,
I wanna shag Jenny.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.880
I couldn't give a fuck
if that hurts Becca.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.680
Let's get some action going.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.680
I thought it would be best
to get away from the drama

20:51.760 --> 20:54.080
and get down to the good business.

21:04.520 --> 21:06.920
See you fucking later,
Aaron and Jenny.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.280
I wanna cut me feelings off
and have a fucking good time.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.760
It's only a bit of fun
between me and Jack.

21:15.640 --> 21:18.920
'While some in the villa
have coupled up, for others,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
it's a night on their own.'

21:22.680 --> 21:24.400
'At least Ross has got company.'

21:45.400 --> 21:47.840
I woke up this morning
in bed with Zahida.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.560
I'm glad I went to bed with her,
she was there for me.

21:50.640 --> 21:54.480
I don't think anything can ruin what
me and Sean have now, we're strong.

21:54.560 --> 21:58.240
I think I'm just in a good place.
This is where I want to be.

21:58.320 --> 22:01.160
I've woken up this morning,
I'm on a better vibe.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.520
I realised that my tactic
of saying how it is

22:03.600 --> 22:07.320
and putting it out there isn't
working. Tonight I'm gonna calm down

22:07.400 --> 22:11.360
and fingers crossed,
Maisie might finally get a shag.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.640
I've woken up this morning
with a nice big prod on my back.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.360
I saw the cheeky face
and I thought, here we go.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.800
I woulda been upset
if I didn't get a prod on my back.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.080
How was the penthouse?

22:22.160 --> 22:23.680
I rather enjoyed myself.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.480
Finally, I got a fucking shag

22:25.560 --> 22:28.360
and the smile
on my fucking face says it all.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.240
I feel a bit sorry for Jenny,

22:30.320 --> 22:33.280
cos I think I've just blown
the kidneys clean out of her.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.720
Bec, you seem
a bit annoyed about this.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.680
Not annoyed at all.

22:37.760 --> 22:41.240
I wanted to bounce a cup of tea
off their heads, but I didn't.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.040
I'm cracking on with Jack,
so what the fuck can I say?

22:44.120 --> 22:46.520
I want my cake and eat it,
but I fucking can't.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.000
You two were rumping
last night, weren't you?

22:49.080 --> 22:50.080
(laughs)

22:50.160 --> 22:51.880
Nah, mate.
We didn't do nowt.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.960
Me and Becca get a long quite well.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.440
It ain't too serious, we're both
just attracted to each other.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.760
How was your night
sleeping alone, Ross?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.600
Sean and Zahida
banging next to me, great.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.960
I've woken up this morning by myself.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.680
I feel like, again, I'm stuck in
the same argument with Harriette.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.800
I can see Ross's point of view now.

23:12.880 --> 23:16.920
The reason Ross said what he did
was cos he was protecting himself.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.680
I need to think
what I wanna say to him.

23:19.760 --> 23:23.520
If this keeps happening and we
having the same arguments,

23:23.600 --> 23:25.480
we're obviously not meant to be.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.600
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

23:34.680 --> 23:35.760
Oh, here we go.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.480
Tablet of Terror, fuck off.

23:37.560 --> 23:41.040
"The exes are coming in waves
and another one has washed up."

23:41.120 --> 23:44.960
"Maisie, Zahida and Jack,
go and meet the next new arrival."

23:46.040 --> 23:48.600
Fuck. I've just laid a shit on Sean.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.000
I'm shitting it. I hate it when
this happens when I'm involved.

23:52.080 --> 23:55.120
But there is a part of me
that wants to see a familiar face.

23:55.200 --> 23:59.320
Fuck's sake. I would rather Harriette
hanging off my ear shouting at me

23:59.400 --> 24:02.600
than sitting down on that sun
lounger, I'll tell you that now.

24:05.280 --> 24:09.880
If it is your ex, trust us,
I'm not out to get revenge.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.400
I feel like I've been waiting
for you to speak to him.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.960
But there's never been the right
moment, do you know what I mean?

24:22.040 --> 24:24.800
The vibe in the villa,
I feel there is a lot of tension.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.280
Especially with Harriette and Ross.
Outside, I'm not like this.

24:28.360 --> 24:33.080
I came in and I lost my head in
someone so bad and fell for someone.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.240
I feel like I've lost myself.

24:35.320 --> 24:38.080
My emotions with Ross
are all over the place.

24:38.160 --> 24:41.000
All I'm trying to do
is be closer to him.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.520
I find it weird that he's not
taken five minutes today to...

24:44.600 --> 24:47.400
No, he's been talking
to Becca the whole day.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.960
What is going on there?
Like, who does she like?

24:52.040 --> 24:54.680
I feel slightly awkward
with the Aaron situation,

24:54.760 --> 24:56.840
cos I feel like
Becca still likes him.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.680
But cos Becca chose Jack,
she can't really say anything.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.720
So, she's not really got
a leg to stand on with it.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.760
She does it with all the guys.

25:05.840 --> 25:08.880
Apparently she was giving
massages to all the boys.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.080
This morning.
To everyone?

25:11.160 --> 25:12.720
Aaron?
No.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.640
That shit would not have happened.

25:14.720 --> 25:18.440
Maybe I should be a bit intimidated
by Becca, cos she is Aaron's ex,

25:18.520 --> 25:20.760
but at the moment
I don't feel it at all.

25:26.240 --> 25:30.000
Come on, girls, let's sit down
and let our arseholes twitch.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.120
I could have an army
come out of there,

25:32.200 --> 25:35.280
but I was with one
for seven and a half years.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.640
There's only one person
I've ever cared for

25:37.720 --> 25:40.520
so if she comes in,
it would fuck me up big time.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.120
I kinda want it
to be one of my exes.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.960
I feel I could wind Sean up a bit
and find out his true feelings.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.360
I want to see if he gets jealous.

25:50.440 --> 25:51.560
What about you, Mais?

25:51.640 --> 25:55.000
There's Sam, who I broke up with,
like, the most recent break up.

25:55.080 --> 25:58.600
I've done stuff wrong, he has too.
There's a lot of raw emotion.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.040
I know we've got
a lot to talk about.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.760
I might wee myself.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.200
This is my ex, Sam.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.280
All right?
Hey.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.760
I did love him.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.720
This is Sam.
Nice to meet you.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.640
Maisie's face dropped.
Looked like she was gonna cry.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.880
There's a lot that's gone on there.

26:39.960 --> 26:40.960
Sit down?

26:42.120 --> 26:45.240
There's a lot more emotion there
than I thought there was.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.960
I'm Sam, I'm 21, I'm from Yorkshire.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.400
I'm 17 stone, I'm just
a pure, loveable twat.

26:51.480 --> 26:55.000
I've had three relationships
all of them have ended horrifically.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.760
Relationships aren't for me.

26:59.600 --> 27:03.080
My last relationship was with
Maisie. I definitely loved her.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.080
Maisie cheated on me twice.

27:05.160 --> 27:08.920
After we broke up, stories came out
of different guys and I turned off.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.080
Although it ended the worst, she was
probably the best relationship.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.560
What have you come here to do?

27:19.480 --> 27:23.200
Just to find out why she did
what she did. She cheated on me.

27:23.280 --> 27:26.200
Erm, Maisie you forgot
to mention that to us all.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.840
I have not cheated on him at all.

27:28.920 --> 27:32.120
I can't believe she's denied it,
that's absolute bullshit.

27:32.200 --> 27:35.960
I did not touch anyone else
when I was with you.

27:36.040 --> 27:39.600
There's a massive part of me that
hoped he'd be like,

27:39.680 --> 27:41.440
"I'm here to clear the air."

27:41.520 --> 27:45.080
But he went straight in, two of
my mates there, saying I cheated.

27:45.160 --> 27:49.720
He must still care to do that. If
he didn't care, you wouldn't bother.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.360
Do you still love each other?

27:52.440 --> 27:56.200
I think there's feelings there. I'm
never not gonna care for the girl.

27:56.280 --> 27:58.480
When I was with Maisie,
I loved her to bits.

27:58.560 --> 28:03.120
We were the same person.
Seeing her today, it's hard.

28:13.320 --> 28:14.840
Pfft. Fuck.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.680
You knew I loved you.
I did love you too.

28:22.680 --> 28:24.680
Maisie looks like she's gonna cry.

28:24.760 --> 28:29.080
I can't help but feel a little bit
of satisfaction seeing it.

28:29.160 --> 28:32.080
Why don't I just stir it up
and a bit more spice?

28:32.160 --> 28:33.680
My ex came here...

28:33.760 --> 28:35.960
I've got no loyalties to Zahida.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.160
Fuck off, you slut.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.840
Maisie!

28:39.920 --> 28:43.120
...she went up to the penthouse
with him and he fingered her.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.440
The first opportunity she gets
to fuck me over, she does it.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.480
We cleared this up
and sorted it...

28:50.560 --> 28:51.560
Yeah, we have.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.160
He's come in and said
I cheated, when I didn't.

28:54.240 --> 28:57.400
I understand she's upset about Joe.
We said we were over it.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.800
I've never cheated in my life.
Shut up.

28:59.880 --> 29:03.200
If I have something to say
and a reason, I'll fucking say it.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.800
I'm not pissed off at you now.

29:04.880 --> 29:08.360
I've got Sean now, I'm making
it clear to him I've got someone.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.400
Don't raise your voice at us
or I'll raise mine at yours.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.800
Revenge.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.280
(Tablet of Terror buzzes)

29:16.360 --> 29:20.440
Oh, here we go.
This shit bag has gone off again.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.320
"Welcome to the beach, Sam."

29:22.400 --> 29:25.280
"Sam and Zahida,
you're off on a date."

29:25.360 --> 29:28.520
"Will it be plain sailing,
or will it rock the boat?"

29:28.600 --> 29:30.440
"Sent from the Tablet of Terror."

29:33.320 --> 29:34.960
Oh, baby.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.440
This is just what I need.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.600
I'll go on a date with Sam,
update him to what Maisie's like

29:40.680 --> 29:42.880
and Sean's gonna miss us
while I'm here.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.880
I dunno whether to laugh
at the fact he's here,

29:48.960 --> 29:52.600
and it's familiar face, or cry
that Zahida's turned on me.

29:52.680 --> 29:56.520
I've got no romantic connection
to anyone.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.400
I feel like a bit
of a lone wolf at the moment.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.600
(cries)

30:07.680 --> 30:09.680
This is nice.
Do you wanna get pissed?

30:09.760 --> 30:12.280
(laughs)
Seems like you and Maisie are mates.

30:12.360 --> 30:15.880
She said to me she's got
no loyalties to me or anyone.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.560
So, basically,
I have no loyalties to her.

30:18.640 --> 30:23.080
I want to get a tiny bit of revenge
by telling Sam all about Maisie

30:23.160 --> 30:25.560
so she can feel a bit of what I felt

30:25.640 --> 30:28.080
when she fucked us over
by going with Joe.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.920
She's been going on like a slag.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.200
She shaved her fanny with my razor.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.960
She goes, "Aaron, if you
wanna fuck me, I'm here."

30:35.040 --> 30:37.400
Offered herself to everyone.
Who does that?

30:37.480 --> 30:40.200
Zahida's filling me in
on what Maisie's been up to,

30:40.280 --> 30:41.520
but I don't give a shit.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.520
Seeing Maisie brought everything
to the surface.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.800
She was one of
the best things in my life.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.440
It's made everything raw.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.520
Since we broke up, my head's fucked.

30:51.600 --> 30:56.200
I can't trust another girl, I've not
been in a proper relationship.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.440
All I did was put my time
and effort in, I just want the truth.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.720
Me and Maisie need to have
a chat about what's happened.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.880
I just want her to admit what
she's done and put it in the past.

31:12.240 --> 31:13.560
Oi, oi.
Hey, hey, hey.

31:13.640 --> 31:17.280
Maisie and Jack return.
Where's the fuck's Zahida?

31:17.360 --> 31:19.840
It's my ex, Sam.
The most recent break-up.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.920
Like, would be interest in Zahida?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Fuck it.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.040
Jackie Chan Sean's getting wound up.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.040
I think I'll play a trick on him.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.840
I'll say Z was like...
All over him.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.360
Yeah?

31:33.720 --> 31:35.960
Z turned round like, "He's my type."

31:36.040 --> 31:38.760
"Right down my street."
They've gone on a date.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.000
She wants to end
the experience with me

31:41.080 --> 31:43.440
and now she's with a guy
and she fancies him?

31:43.520 --> 31:44.960
All over him.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.600
I was like, fucking hell, man.

31:47.680 --> 31:51.160
Seany boy's face has dropped.
Getting a little bit nervous.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.880
If she has done that, that's not
right, cos she's been kicking off.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.680
He's shitting himself.

31:57.760 --> 32:00.160
(laughs)

32:00.240 --> 32:03.120
She doesn't really like him, man,
I'm winding you up.

32:03.200 --> 32:07.840
(laughter, applause)

32:10.520 --> 32:12.760
Sean's let out
the biggest sigh of relief.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.520
He's been giving it the big one,

32:14.600 --> 32:17.280
so now we know he does like her.

32:18.320 --> 32:21.280
'While everyone else waits
for Sam and Zahida to return,

32:21.360 --> 32:24.120
Sean's taken up
relationship counselling.'

32:24.200 --> 32:26.640
'To fill the villa
with positive vibes.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.960
Harriette and Ross are my best pals,
I wish they'd sort it out.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.960
Be on, be on and be on. Stop fucking
giving up on each other.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.120
Would you rather have come in here

32:36.200 --> 32:39.720
and neither of you be here,
so you could crack on and enjoy it?

32:39.800 --> 32:42.080
Or are you glad yous met each other?

32:44.200 --> 32:45.760
I'd never regret Ross.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.440
He's made my time in here.

32:51.280 --> 32:54.320
You haven't ruined my time at all,
other people have.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.800
You haven't.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.680
When I walk out of this villa,
I wanna be walking out with Ross.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.240
100%.

33:08.320 --> 33:13.120
Actions speak louder than words, but
at least now she's doing something.

33:13.200 --> 33:17.360
(applause)
Fucking beautiful!

33:17.440 --> 33:20.120
'Aww, hashtag totes emosh.'

33:21.800 --> 33:25.440
Maisie, why have you got a dress on
where you're half naked?

33:25.520 --> 33:28.680
Do you want your ex boyfriend
to see all this shit?

33:28.760 --> 33:30.640
I wanna show him what he's missing.

33:30.720 --> 33:31.880
(cheering)

33:31.960 --> 33:34.120
If Sam offered sex tonight,
I'd take it.

33:34.200 --> 33:37.960
There's so much emotion there, he's
good in bed, got a massive willy.

33:38.040 --> 33:41.920
It would be nice to have some sort
of homely feeling around me.

33:43.360 --> 33:46.120
(cheering)

33:46.200 --> 33:47.680
Fingers crossed it's OK.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.120
All right, man?

33:49.200 --> 33:52.720
Sam, on first impression,
who do you fancy the most, mate?

33:52.800 --> 33:55.040
Mais is looking all right,
obviously.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.520
Yeah, apart from Mais.
Apart from Mais.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.960
I wouldn't go that far,
fucking hell.

34:04.040 --> 34:07.240
Maisie, you ain't having
no luck here, even with your ex.

34:07.320 --> 34:10.480
She already told me how you tried
to crack on with everybody.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.040
I know Sam,
I know he has emotions there.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.639
I feel like he can't admit it.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.719
Let's go and have a chat.
A lot of shit needs to be aired.

34:17.800 --> 34:21.159
We need to be on our own
and speak about what's going on.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.080
Why are you denying cheating on me?

34:23.159 --> 34:26.520
I will swear on my nan's grave,
I did not touch another guy.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.760
You're such a liar.

34:27.840 --> 34:32.360
Maisie's still not giving me the
answers. For me, that's her lying.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.639
I did not touch another guy
when we were together.

34:35.719 --> 34:37.239
OK.

34:37.320 --> 34:39.199
Sam is not listening to anything.

34:39.280 --> 34:42.000
I didn't cheat and there's no way
of convincing him.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.920
You're not giving me any closure.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.040
It's going nowhere. She's not
admitting what she's done.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.679
I cannot be arsed with it any more.

34:49.760 --> 34:53.199
Is there anything between us now,
or is that it?

34:53.280 --> 34:55.400
There's always
gonna be emotion there.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.680
We had the best relationship
I've had.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.760
And I'm always gonna care for you.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.480
At the end of the day, after what
you did, I could never trust you.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.240
Feelings I did have for Maisie
are absolutely gone.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.680
(cheering)

35:25.760 --> 35:30.120
'Maisie might be alone, but at least
the rest of them feel the love.'

35:31.720 --> 35:33.600
I'm fucking fuming.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.240
'Oh, yeah, not her.
Definitely not Becca.'

35:36.320 --> 35:38.280
I don't like seeing him
with someone.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.520
This situation's gonna get nasty.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.640
I can hear Becca talking.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.080
Nothing.
I heard you.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.880
Sticking up for Jenny?
You've only known her a day.

35:52.960 --> 35:54.440
(indistinct)

35:54.520 --> 35:56.280
I 100% wasn't talking about you.

35:56.360 --> 35:58.520
About Jennifer?
It doesn't matter.

35:58.600 --> 36:01.920
Why was it about me, though?
Cos you look at me like a dickhead.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.160
Who does she think she's talking to?

36:04.240 --> 36:08.040
I have no interest in the girl,
I wouldn't even waste a look.

36:08.120 --> 36:12.000
You're the one who looked at me
when I walked in like I was a knob.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.880
Why would I look at you like that?

36:13.960 --> 36:15.240
Sit yourself down, pet.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.120
Come and make me sit down.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.640
Calm your little tits.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.720
Shut the fuck up.
OK. Make me shut the fuck up.

36:23.120 --> 36:26.960
I don't know what's going on here,
but shit's getting serious.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.400
But, obviously, seeing you,
so surreal with someone else,

36:31.480 --> 36:33.600
that's hurt her.
It's awful, isn't it?

36:33.680 --> 36:36.200
It's fucking awful.
We don't rub it in your face.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.120
You were with Jack when I walked in.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.560
You've made your bed.
Lie in it and fuck off.

36:40.640 --> 36:44.720
I walked in and you were getting
with ZaraLena! Fucking idiot!

36:44.960 --> 36:46.920
Go the fuck home.
You get home.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.480
Why would I?
Oh, cos you're shagging that cunt?

36:49.560 --> 36:52.880
She was a good shag, believe me.
Oh, nice one. Buzzing.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.360
The fact Becca was cracking on with
Jack means it was good for her,

36:56.440 --> 36:59.080
but as soon as I get a girl,
she can't stand it.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.360
That, to me, is double standards.

37:01.440 --> 37:06.120
If you were happy shagging Jack,
why haven't you shagged again?

37:06.200 --> 37:08.280
Please answer that question.

37:18.360 --> 37:22.200
That's an awkward silence.

37:22.280 --> 37:27.240
Becca and Aaron keep bickering, they
just talk shit about each other.

37:27.320 --> 37:30.080
End of the day, I know
whose bed she's getting into.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.440
Hopefully tonight,
I get the penthouse.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.120
Come on then.
Come on then.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.920
Me and Aaron are done.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.720
I'm moving on with Jack,
he's moving on with Jenny.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.400
I don't care about Aaron.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.040
And you know what?
I wanna move forward with Jack.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.520
I'm not just doing it to get back
at Aaron, why would I?

38:05.040 --> 38:07.640
I'm over Aaron 100%.

38:07.720 --> 38:11.520
'And that's why
you're giving 110% right now.'

38:21.120 --> 38:24.960
So, I go to bed nice and early and
then Harriette comes crawling in.

38:28.960 --> 38:32.280
Bottom line is, I've had
a few too many drinks tonight and...

38:33.280 --> 38:36.840
...I'm horny and I don't
give a fuck what's gone on.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.320
(laughs) Have I just been used?

38:54.600 --> 38:56.200
I think I have.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.280
I feel great about it.

38:59.305 --> 39:05.442
