00:03.680 --> 00:06.200
I can't. I'm sorry.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.119
I'm sorry.
Jack?

00:11.200 --> 00:14.560
Anna Bligh, would you
do me the honour...

00:14.560 --> 00:15.800
I'm engaged!

00:15.800 --> 00:17.640
Keep it.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.480
ANNA: I won't change my mind.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.920
You've been very good today,
haven't you, little one?

00:24.920 --> 00:28.240
No kicking to disturb Mummy.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.360
I know what you're doing.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.520
And I've told George the worst
that can possibly be told.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.640
Nothing Regina unearths can hurt us
if we weather this.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.360
I don't care what it costs.

rid us of her forever.

Happy New Year.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.760
Well, thank you,
and for coming tonight

01:06.760 --> 01:09.080
You seemed to enjoy yourself.

01:09.080 --> 01:12.280
A brave face is a requirement
lately.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.920
He does make her happy, you know.

George, Miss Adams? James, Olivia?
Young Poletti, Anna?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
my need for a fixed smile.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.600
Gino and Anna.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.600
I can't share your optimism.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.840
What about you?
What does 1954 hold for you?

01:33.840 --> 01:35.840
Well, life goes on.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.520
The thing about wearing a mask

01:39.520 --> 01:42.400
is that you recognise one
when you see one.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.920
Good luck with whatever it is.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.280

Doris is busting
to congratulate you.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.080
Oh, I think it's sweet
she's so excited.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.680
Yeah, once she got over
the shock

02:02.680 --> 02:04.680
of Italian lessons leading
to an engagement ring.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.200
What about her shock
at your tales of the party?

What?

02:14.240 --> 02:16.800
Whenever I mentioned Carolyn
or the party,

02:16.800 --> 02:22.040
it either went very well and he's too
shy to talk about it, or very

02:22.040 --> 02:24.400
Or he thinks it's no-one's business,
Doris.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.640
My summer wardrobe's
looking a little sparse.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.480
I might pop up to the city.

03:21.760 --> 03:25.640
I'm not sure I'm ready for crowds.
That's alright.

03:25.640 --> 03:30.280
You've much better things to do
than watch me shopping, anyway.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.000
Well, how about you take Anna?

03:35.280 --> 03:37.840
I think I'd enjoy a day alone.

I may even drive.

I suggest you keep your voice down

Rather plays into my plans too.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.560
Oh, how lovely!

I suspect there's benefit
in it for you.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.000
The party?
Oh.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.920
I rather assumed
that Anna's behaviour

05:47.920 --> 05:50.280
had forfeited me
any chance of a favour.

Oh, my dear, that's between

refuse an invitation

05:55.440 --> 05:58.400
to congratulate

If you're sure...

05:59.840 --> 06:04.840
Well, I restore my social bona fides
and you destroy the Jew's.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.640
Well, sooner is better
under the circumstances.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.120
Mm-hm, then soonest is best.
Within the fortnight, then?

06:11.120 --> 06:13.920

immediately.

Oh, you didn't wait.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.980
My apologies.

06:29.980 --> 06:33.340
Miss Adams not joining us?
I dropped her at work.

06:33.340 --> 06:36.140
Well, that's why we have Norman.
It's a labour of love.

06:36.140 --> 06:39.500
You old romantic.
And proud to be so.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.640
Olivia's off to the city on Monday
if there's anything you require.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.560
My summer wardrobe
needs replenishing.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.440
Well, you must buy
something very special

06:49.440 --> 06:51.640
for the Swansons' garden party.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.080

I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

06:59.120 --> 07:02.560
We're all invited,
and after Anna's disgraceful antics

07:02.560 --> 07:07.080
no-one, George, will add insult
to injury by declining.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.760
Nor you by accepting.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.280
I'm surprised I'm even included.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.760
Some people know the meaning
of the word courtesy.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.640
And naturally Prudence included
Miss Adams in the invitation.

07:17.640 --> 07:21.680
Amy, this oatmeal's a little
underdone this morning.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.740
Jack.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.540
You're back.

07:35.860 --> 07:37.860
Someone had to break the impasse.

07:37.860 --> 07:40.060
I've given you a week.
I've been busy.

07:41.140 --> 07:43.220
I accept that our situation
is complex,

07:43.220 --> 07:44.940
but my kisses aren't that repulsive.

07:44.940 --> 07:47.460
I have a patient.
Unless they're dying...

07:48.780 --> 07:50.740
You were ashen when you fled.

07:50.740 --> 07:52.940
The party can't have
horrified you that much.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.300
Of course not.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.580
So it's not the differences
in our worlds?

07:56.580 --> 07:58.060
No.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.220
Whatever the problem is...
I can't say.

08:00.220 --> 08:01.860
Why not?
I just can't.

08:03.220 --> 08:05.300
It's private.

08:05.300 --> 08:07.780
Don't tell me
James isn't the only one.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.220
That's not even funny.

08:09.220 --> 08:11.300
I'm just trying
to make sense of this.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.260
You owe me some sort of explanation.

08:20.940 --> 08:22.500
I can't.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.580
It's too personal.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.820
I see.

08:33.299 --> 08:37.020
I am falling in love with you
all over again, Jack.

08:37.020 --> 08:40.020
I've fallen. There, it's said.

08:41.580 --> 08:42.940
Right.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.620
We're too old to be coy.
You feel it too.

08:47.740 --> 08:49.780
Course I do.

08:52.220 --> 08:54.140
I'll be back Monday.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.660
I hope you're ready to trust.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.940
Happy New Year.
Oh!

09:38.940 --> 09:43.140
We announce ourselves
in polite society.

09:43.140 --> 09:44.780
Welcome home.

09:44.780 --> 09:48.140
Tea?
Later.

09:48.140 --> 09:51.580
I thought you'd had your fill
of the bucolic life.

09:51.580 --> 09:54.580
I'd like to move down here
for an indefinite period,

09:54.580 --> 09:56.140
take over the cottage.

09:56.140 --> 09:59.860
I'd like that very much.
But I insist you stay here.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.780
The cottage is best.

10:01.780 --> 10:04.500
I've developed feelings for Jack

10:04.500 --> 10:07.060
and I'd like a private space
in which to explore them.

10:08.860 --> 10:11.700
Jack Duncan?
Yes.

10:14.420 --> 10:16.420
This is very sudden.

10:16.420 --> 10:18.500
Love often is.

10:24.140 --> 10:26.580
And it is love.

10:26.580 --> 10:28.700
And that's why I want to be here.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.580
Many a woman has tried
with him and failed.

10:31.580 --> 10:35.140
They weren't the right woman.
Oh, Carolyn, he's a country doctor.

10:35.140 --> 10:36.700
Your existence is...

10:36.700 --> 10:39.220
I'm a lot more at home
with a good book

10:39.220 --> 10:41.060
than hanging from
the chandelier of late.

10:41.060 --> 10:42.620
Some consolation.

10:45.220 --> 10:47.740
I don't want to sneak around
behind your back.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.020
For that I thank you.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.660
I'll take possession Monday.

10:54.940 --> 10:57.380
I'd rather you stayed
well out of it.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.540
I will say one thing.

11:01.940 --> 11:06.580
If this might possibly be a whim,
walk away. Now.

11:06.580 --> 11:09.220
He deserves better
than a broken heart.

11:20.940 --> 11:25.020
Was it...anything that I did?

11:25.020 --> 11:29.580
Looking for cause is pointless.
It only adds to the sorrow.

11:29.580 --> 11:34.060
There's no doubt?
No.  I'm sorry, Mrs Bligh.

11:38.380 --> 11:39.860
My baby.

11:41.780 --> 11:44.060
Is there someone I can contact,
someone to collect you?

11:44.060 --> 11:47.220
No. No-one must know of this.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.740
Your husband, surely.

11:51.740 --> 11:54.220
I want to tell him myself.

11:54.220 --> 11:56.460
In my own time.

11:56.460 --> 12:00.620
Thank you for your concern,
but I will manage.

12:02.020 --> 12:05.220
It won't be easy carrying
your dead child to term.

12:05.220 --> 12:08.140
You'll need all the support
your loved ones can give you.

12:08.140 --> 12:11.780
Time enough to grieve together
when the baby is born.

12:11.780 --> 12:13.940
Don't add secrecy to your burden.

12:13.940 --> 12:19.220
I expect your discretion
until I say otherwise.

12:19.220 --> 12:21.220
I'm obliged to give it.

12:21.220 --> 12:23.900
I do so reluctantly.

12:26.660 --> 12:28.420
Thank you.

13:26.299 --> 13:28.339
She's just outside.
I won't be a moment.

13:28.339 --> 13:31.339
Oh, the operator has Mrs Standish
in Paris on the line.

13:31.339 --> 13:33.779
Would you like to talk
while I fetch Mrs Bligh?

13:33.779 --> 13:35.459
Oh, there's no need for Mrs Bligh.

13:35.459 --> 13:37.259
Oh, she asked...
Thank you, Amy.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.459
Put Mrs Standish through, operator.

13:44.859 --> 13:47.619
Regina.
George.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.099
What a pleasant surprise.

13:50.099 --> 13:52.379
So, have you discovered anything?

13:53.939 --> 13:55.699
It seemed important to your mother

13:55.699 --> 13:57.859
to be sure of
Miss Adams' background.

13:57.859 --> 14:01.459
It's none of your business.
There are things...

14:01.459 --> 14:05.219
If you want to be welcome
at Ash Park, you'll stop. Now.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.059
There are matters that...
Don't.

14:07.059 --> 14:08.779
And don't telephone again.

14:08.779 --> 14:11.659
I insist you avoid any attempts
by Mother to contact you.

14:11.659 --> 14:13.459
George...
Unless you...

14:13.459 --> 14:15.779
..you want to lose
my friendship forever.

14:15.779 --> 14:20.179
Well, I'd die rather than risk that.
Good.

14:31.539 --> 14:33.419
The Thomas Cook desk.

14:33.419 --> 14:36.139
I wish to book
a plane journey to Australia.

14:37.339 --> 14:39.779
So I am to be forbidden
communication now?

14:39.779 --> 14:41.539
I will not have you
making mischief.

14:41.539 --> 14:45.299
I have done nothing that
I did not consider necessary.

14:45.299 --> 14:47.459
That justification
is becoming very stale.

14:59.579 --> 15:01.899
You sure you're ready for that?

15:03.619 --> 15:05.419
It's good to use my body again.

15:05.419 --> 15:07.779
Doing is good. Overdoing isn't.

15:08.899 --> 15:11.819
This party...
What about it?

15:11.819 --> 15:14.259
Don't feel badgered into going.

15:14.259 --> 15:15.779
Ah.

15:15.779 --> 15:18.499
Yeah, I'll...I'll decide on the day.

15:18.499 --> 15:20.459
Same goes for you.

15:20.459 --> 15:25.939
George Bligh's Jewish nurse -
the knives will be sharpened.

15:25.939 --> 15:28.339
I'm well up to the challenge.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.899
Hello?

15:36.339 --> 15:38.219
Anyone home?

15:38.219 --> 15:39.859
Yoo-hoo!

15:39.859 --> 15:45.499
I was doing my rounds and I thought,
"Oh, that's Miss Anna's horse!

15:45.499 --> 15:49.419
"I must let her know
how thrilled we all are."

15:49.419 --> 15:51.179
Oh, I'm all a-puff.

15:51.179 --> 15:53.299
May I?
Oh.

15:53.299 --> 15:58.259
I can? Oh, how charming,
yet so discreet.

15:58.259 --> 16:02.979
One understands, given that
Gino ekes a living from the land.

16:02.979 --> 16:06.059
I can't imagine a better ring.

16:06.059 --> 16:09.299
As I said to Mr Collins
the day he proposed -

16:09.299 --> 16:12.419
"It's not what you spend,
it's what you feel."

16:12.419 --> 16:16.219
First your father and Miss Adams,
now you.

16:16.219 --> 16:17.219
Yes.

16:21.859 --> 16:25.539
one hears
the social barriers tumbling.

16:25.539 --> 16:28.139
And who knows, perhaps even between

16:28.139 --> 16:31.139
a country doctor and a glamorous
woman of the world, hmm?

16:31.139 --> 16:32.659
Who knows?

16:34.779 --> 16:36.979
I'm not back to badger you
for answers.

16:36.979 --> 16:38.459
Good.

16:39.859 --> 16:41.499
I told Mother I love you.

16:44.539 --> 16:46.339
How'd she take that?

16:46.339 --> 16:49.819
If she hasn't talked to you,
obviously as well as I thought.

16:49.819 --> 16:51.419
But that's not the point.

16:53.219 --> 16:58.179
Do you think I would have braved her
if I truly didn't want you?

17:04.659 --> 17:07.739
Whatever there is to tell,
you'll tell in your own good time.

17:09.419 --> 17:12.459
And I promise I won't let you down.

17:17.858 --> 17:19.378
Wait.

17:26.339 --> 17:28.299
You said at your party that

17:28.299 --> 17:30.979
any woman deserved better
than a compromise.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.379
Testosterone.

17:46.779 --> 17:50.059
Injected twice a week
for the last eight years.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.899
Manhood in a syringe.

17:57.819 --> 17:59.499
Japs took mine.

18:04.179 --> 18:06.979
Tortured me and smashed them
between two stones.

18:06.979 --> 18:09.099
Still keen?

18:16.539 --> 18:19.819
I shouldn't have told you.
Please.

18:19.819 --> 18:22.139
I don't want pity.
It's not pity!

18:22.139 --> 18:23.299
Isn't it?
No.

18:23.299 --> 18:24.979
I'm no bloody use to a woman.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.299
That's pity.

18:27.299 --> 18:28.939
That's self-pity.

18:28.939 --> 18:30.539
This is...

18:31.619 --> 18:33.339
..is sorrow.

18:34.579 --> 18:37.299
It's pain. It's love.

18:38.899 --> 18:41.179
Love me.

19:29.499 --> 19:31.499
JAMES: This is where I kissed Harry.

19:34.859 --> 19:37.059
OLIVIA: Then how do we proceed?

19:37.059 --> 19:40.139
JAMES: As husband and wife.

19:40.139 --> 19:42.139
As parents.

19:43.779 --> 19:45.499
(SOBS)

20:28.499 --> 20:30.299
JAMES: You're home early.

20:31.499 --> 20:34.179
Hope that's good news for my wallet.
(LAUGHS)

20:35.699 --> 20:38.139
I restrained my worst impulses.

20:40.059 --> 20:42.179
I'm desperate for a cup of tea.

20:43.499 --> 20:46.179
How are you? How is everyone?

20:55.579 --> 20:57.779
Let me know when
the caterers arrive.

20:57.779 --> 21:00.379
Oh, keep an eye on Cook
with the champagne.

21:00.379 --> 21:01.859
Yes, ma'am.
(LAUGHS)

21:01.859 --> 21:05.219
Top it up with the champagne.
Oh, must you?

21:05.219 --> 21:08.579
I need an early start if I'm to deal
with the bores you've invited.

21:08.579 --> 21:10.899
You're up to something.

21:10.899 --> 21:14.059
That is rather the pot
calling the kettle black.

21:14.059 --> 21:16.659
Well, we'd best not dally
if we're to be punctual.

21:16.659 --> 21:19.739
Now, James, are you sure
you're feeling up to this?

21:19.739 --> 21:22.979
Have to face the world sometime.
Excellent.

21:22.979 --> 21:25.059
9:30, in the sitting room?

21:25.059 --> 21:30.939
Ooh, synchronise watches. Attention.
ELIZABETH: I heard that, miss.

21:30.939 --> 21:35.059
(LAUGHS)
I am so lucky to have a leave pass.

21:36.339 --> 21:40.019
You're awfully quiet, Olivia.
Am I? Oh.

21:40.019 --> 21:44.059
Our first appearance
in Sydney society together.

21:44.059 --> 21:47.299
Lavender and lace
and boring small talk.

21:47.299 --> 21:49.419
Are you sure about this?

21:49.419 --> 21:51.739
The way Anna describes it,
who could resist?

21:51.739 --> 21:55.379
You just want an excuse not to go.
How did you guess?

21:55.379 --> 21:57.299
Excuse me.

21:57.299 --> 22:00.139
Well, I for one
am looking forward to it.

22:00.139 --> 22:01.659
Remind him he said that

22:01.659 --> 22:04.659
when he's being bored witless
by dreary society dames.

22:04.659 --> 22:06.859
We might be pleasantly surprised.

22:10.259 --> 22:13.339
And you have a lovely day at home.

22:13.339 --> 22:16.139
Is it just me
or has Olivia been odd?

22:16.139 --> 22:20.099
She's had this strange
fixed smile on all week.

22:20.099 --> 22:22.579
She has a lot on her mind.

22:22.579 --> 22:25.459
Their problem's not one
that's solved overnight.

22:25.459 --> 22:27.139
I suppose it is that.

22:27.139 --> 22:29.779
Do you think they'll divorce?

22:31.539 --> 22:34.659
I think she'll do anything
to make sure they don't.

22:34.659 --> 22:37.579
I'd be thoughtful in her shoes too.

22:43.499 --> 22:46.339
Part of me wanted to say
absolutely not,

22:46.339 --> 22:49.859
but I can't lock myself away
forever.

22:51.379 --> 22:53.339
I do worry about my memory.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.699
The treatment's left me
with some blanks.

22:57.019 --> 23:00.779
I hope I don't run into somebody
I know and just stare at them.

23:06.539 --> 23:08.779
Are you sure you want to go?

23:08.779 --> 23:11.219
Whatever's right for you.

23:12.939 --> 23:14.579
Hey.

23:20.619 --> 23:22.939
Are you positive?

23:24.459 --> 23:26.499
James...

23:26.499 --> 23:29.419
You can't do it, can you?

23:29.419 --> 23:31.419
I mean, us.
No.

23:31.419 --> 23:35.219
No, of course I can. We can.

23:38.179 --> 23:39.779
Then what?

23:43.179 --> 23:45.539
We will make it work.

23:46.699 --> 23:48.539
The three of us.

23:50.619 --> 23:52.219
What?

23:54.259 --> 23:55.899
I'm sorry.

23:57.899 --> 24:01.979
We will step out as a family.

24:04.299 --> 24:06.059
I'd like that.

24:13.179 --> 24:16.499
You've got that look in your eye.
What look?

24:16.499 --> 24:20.499
You've never been one
to allow a slight to go unpunished.

24:20.499 --> 24:22.819
I agree what Anna did to you
is outrageous,

24:22.819 --> 24:25.459
but try to avoid
your baser instincts.

24:25.459 --> 24:26.939
Of course, Mother.

24:26.939 --> 24:30.899
We couldn't have Dame Elizabeth
unsettled, could we?

24:30.899 --> 24:32.499
What's it to do with Elizabeth?

24:32.499 --> 24:35.459
She put me in a position
to be humiliated.

24:35.459 --> 24:37.979
It's unfair to blame others.

24:37.979 --> 24:39.659
The girl was simply being foolish.

24:39.659 --> 24:42.859
She knew exactly what she was doing
and she sniggered while she did it.

24:42.859 --> 24:45.619
Well, it's a good thing
she declined the invitation, then.

24:45.619 --> 24:46.779
Yes.

24:50.139 --> 24:52.139
What are your intentions?

24:52.139 --> 24:55.779
As yours. To be the perfect host.

24:55.779 --> 24:58.939
Ah.
Go easy with that.

24:58.939 --> 25:00.659
Don't fret, Mother.

25:00.659 --> 25:02.699
To us.

25:05.059 --> 25:07.299
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

25:07.299 --> 25:09.419
Ah, Miss Adams, more than punctual.

25:09.419 --> 25:11.539
I wanted a moment alone.

25:11.539 --> 25:14.899
Today is obviously designed
to see me out of my depth.

25:14.899 --> 25:17.299
Well, I'm sure you'll make of it

25:17.299 --> 25:19.379
whatever your social skills
will allow.

25:19.379 --> 25:21.499
I will.

25:21.499 --> 25:25.699
If Regina's already discovered this,
I apologise for the repetition.

25:25.699 --> 25:30.699
My husband was well connected
in Parisian literary circles.

25:30.699 --> 25:34.499
Gide and Malraux were our friends.
We mixed in all manner of society.

25:34.499 --> 25:37.819
If you spent less time fighting me
and more time knowing me,

25:37.819 --> 25:40.419
you'd know there's nothing today
that might throw me off kilter.

25:45.059 --> 25:47.619
It's a lovely morning.

25:47.619 --> 25:49.139
I'll wait outside.

25:49.139 --> 25:52.139
(ELEGANT STRING MUSIC)

26:02.499 --> 26:06.339
Darling Pattie and I were together
at Fintona Girls' of course.

26:06.339 --> 26:09.059
Pattie Leckie she was called then.

26:08.859 --> 26:11.019
Oh, it's Elizabeth Bligh's party.

26:11.019 --> 26:13.939
Her son's brought
his working-class Jewess.

26:13.939 --> 26:16.419
(GASPS)
Quite the scandal.

26:16.419 --> 26:18.499
Elizabeth darling! (LAUGHS)

26:18.499 --> 26:20.979
Oh, and Olivia!

26:20.979 --> 26:22.619
Mwah!

26:22.619 --> 26:24.699
James.

26:24.699 --> 26:28.339
George. This must be your fiancee,
I presume.

26:28.339 --> 26:29.459
Sarah Adams.

26:29.459 --> 26:31.219
Thank you for inviting me,
Lady Prudence.

26:31.219 --> 26:35.379
Lady Swanson. My husband is a knight
but I have no title myself.

26:35.379 --> 26:38.259
Oh, you'll capture
these social subtleties with time.

26:38.259 --> 26:41.699
They're becoming increasingly
irrelevant, aren't they, with time?

26:46.979 --> 26:51.139
She's no wilting violet.
I'll see her out of her depth.

26:51.139 --> 26:55.219
James and Olivia, there's no need
to feel discomfort because of Anna.

26:55.219 --> 26:59.379
I hope you don't mind
my monopolising your lovely wife.

26:59.379 --> 27:00.939
I need a barrier against

27:00.939 --> 27:02.899
the simpering eligibles
Mother's invited.

27:06.219 --> 27:08.219
How have you been since Christmas?
Sir?

27:08.219 --> 27:09.859
Thank you.

27:09.859 --> 27:12.219
I couldn't help myself.
She deserved it.

27:12.219 --> 27:14.939
She was being a snob.
So it seemed.

27:14.939 --> 27:18.299
(LAUGHS) It came out in a way
I didn't intend.

27:18.299 --> 27:22.299
Some time together perhaps
before the guest of honour arrives?

27:22.299 --> 27:25.219
Introductions.
Excuse me.

27:26.859 --> 27:30.419
Although I can't imagine there'd
be anyone here that you'd know.

27:33.099 --> 27:34.899
ANNA: Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop.

27:38.859 --> 27:41.019
He's there.

27:41.019 --> 27:45.019
If they're doing what I think they're
doing, let's leave them to it.

27:45.019 --> 27:48.059
Maybe they're not.
Maybe they are.

27:49.739 --> 27:51.419
Maybe we should.

27:56.899 --> 27:59.779
Nothing has to happen
that you don't feel ready for.

28:09.059 --> 28:11.419
Most men wear trousers.
I hide behind them.

28:11.419 --> 28:12.939
Don't.

28:24.779 --> 28:26.299
No?

28:28.939 --> 28:30.499
Yes?

28:46.779 --> 28:51.179
I wanted this...
I dreaded it for years,

28:51.179 --> 28:54.139
letting someone see.

28:58.819 --> 29:02.659
I want to give you
so much more than I can.

29:02.659 --> 29:06.139
I want to give you all of myself.

29:22.339 --> 29:23.859
Kiss me.

29:33.419 --> 29:35.059
Lower.

30:21.044 --> 30:25.524
This is the first family invitation
I've been able to say no to.

30:25.524 --> 30:28.124
(LAUGHS) How does that
make you feel?

30:28.124 --> 30:29.764
Free.

30:29.764 --> 30:32.044
Like Anna Poletti.

30:32.044 --> 30:35.364
You're still a Bligh.
I'm not the Bligh I thought I was.

30:36.964 --> 30:39.764
I wonder what
my real father's surname is.

30:39.764 --> 30:41.644
Ask your mamma.

30:45.324 --> 30:46.964
Do you think you ever will?

30:46.964 --> 30:48.804
Ask about him?
Mmm.

30:50.684 --> 30:53.284
I didn't want to add
to Father's burdens.

30:54.604 --> 30:58.524
But he's happy with us now
and he has Sarah.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.204
He does.

31:01.684 --> 31:03.204
So?

31:04.404 --> 31:06.524
So if the party goes well...

31:08.164 --> 31:10.484
..I'll tell him.

31:16.484 --> 31:18.644
It's so hard trusting anyone.

31:20.804 --> 31:22.924
But you did.

31:25.964 --> 31:30.364
I understand now why it meant
so much to you to learn about Anna.

31:30.364 --> 31:32.684
It's a miracle to me.

31:35.404 --> 31:37.324
So are you.

31:37.324 --> 31:40.644
Was it how you remember?
Being with you?

31:40.644 --> 31:44.164
More beautiful.
Hardly.

31:44.164 --> 31:45.924
To me you are.

31:48.084 --> 31:49.564
You?

31:51.164 --> 31:56.124
It's as intense, in a different way.

31:56.124 --> 31:57.644
Yeah.

32:01.044 --> 32:04.204
I never thought
I'd have this again either.

32:17.044 --> 32:19.884
How are you bearing up?
I'm fine.

32:19.884 --> 32:22.244
Although I do wonder what
all these people would think

32:22.244 --> 32:24.124
if they knew what
I'd just been through.

32:24.124 --> 32:26.524
I know. That's why I asked.

32:29.204 --> 32:33.124
Your wife's been commandeered.
I'm glad she's enjoying herself.

32:33.124 --> 32:35.124
She's not the only one.

32:50.404 --> 32:52.764
Sarah and I won't be
returning with you.

32:52.764 --> 32:56.204
I thought we'd stay in town for
the night to celebrate her success.

32:56.204 --> 32:59.604
Smugness is most unbecoming, George.

and the just plain desperate.

33:08.244 --> 33:10.524
Whatever Anna was,
she was none of those.

33:15.524 --> 33:17.964
I should get back to James.

33:17.964 --> 33:19.644
You will, but first...

33:21.884 --> 33:23.404
Yes?

33:28.684 --> 33:30.604
I'm going to be presumptuous.

33:32.324 --> 33:34.044
You've been lying about James

33:34.044 --> 33:36.884
from the first time I ran into you
at the hospital.

33:38.484 --> 33:41.204
I know a troubled marriage
when I see one.

33:41.204 --> 33:44.484
I want you to know
that you can trust me.

33:44.484 --> 33:48.044
You've only family in Australia,
no friends.

33:48.044 --> 33:50.404
If you ever need a good friend...

33:51.884 --> 33:53.364
Thank you.

33:57.244 --> 33:58.764
I'm sorry.

33:58.764 --> 34:01.484
I'm not prying.
Oh, I know.

34:04.524 --> 34:10.603
There is something dreadful
I have to tell James.

34:12.524 --> 34:14.244
I don't know how to.

34:14.244 --> 34:18.563
I'm...I'm just terrified that...

34:20.643 --> 34:22.444
..I'll lose him.

34:22.444 --> 34:25.684
The one thing I salvaged
from that debacle with Anna

34:25.684 --> 34:27.643
is an affection for you.

34:27.643 --> 34:31.083
Any help in any way.

34:40.724 --> 34:42.484
It's the baby.

34:54.364 --> 34:57.764
Dame Pattie, Mr George Bligh.

34:57.764 --> 34:59.364
Congratulations, Dame Pattie.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.644
I had the pleasure of meeting
Sir Robert last year.

35:01.644 --> 35:03.164
How nice, young man.

35:03.164 --> 35:05.884
I see you've met my fiancee.
She's charming.

35:05.884 --> 35:09.844
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
It's a compliment.

35:09.844 --> 35:12.444
(LAUGHTER)
And I concur, Louis.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.924
I was recently unwell

35:13.924 --> 35:17.444
and I have nothing but admiration for
the nursing profession, Miss Adams.

35:17.444 --> 35:20.884
How is your local hospital in...?
Inverness.

35:20.884 --> 35:23.004
A great change from London, I'm sure.

35:23.004 --> 35:25.764
SARAH: Yes, it's quite charming,
actually.

35:27.044 --> 35:30.004
Oh, he won't notice I've been crying?

35:30.004 --> 35:33.804
Just say it's the glare.
Nothing you've said goes any
furth

35:33.804 --> 35:35.924
I might steal this one
off you, old man,

35:35.924 --> 35:37.804
now I have no other prospects.

35:37.804 --> 35:40.284
Well, you'll have
a fight on your hands.

35:40.284 --> 35:41.964
I should hope so.

35:45.124 --> 35:48.844
You disappeared.
Oh, Andrew needed a shoulder.

35:48.844 --> 35:51.604
Your eyes are red.

35:51.604 --> 35:54.844
Oh, it's the glare.

35:56.244 --> 35:59.364
You're spending an awful lot of time
with Olivia Bligh.

35:59.364 --> 36:01.444
She's a very good friend of Anna's.

36:01.444 --> 36:03.844
I wanted to prove
there was no ill feeling.

36:11.244 --> 36:13.324
I did my best.
Oh, you did.

36:13.324 --> 36:16.324
I threw her together with anyone
who could raise her hackles

36:16.324 --> 36:20.964
and she put them in their place
as charmingly as she did me.

36:20.964 --> 36:23.404
And now there's
Pattie's seal of approval.

36:23.404 --> 36:24.884
Yes.

36:26.484 --> 36:28.284
So?

36:28.284 --> 36:31.764
I suspect check, if not checkmate.

36:31.764 --> 36:33.404
Well...

36:34.844 --> 36:37.604
(TENSE MUSIC)

36:56.804 --> 36:59.564
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
AMY: Miss Anna?

36:59.564 --> 37:01.564
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Miss?

37:04.044 --> 37:05.564
Miss?

37:08.964 --> 37:11.044
I was napping.

37:11.044 --> 37:12.964
Mrs Standish has arrived.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.124
She's in Europe.
She's in the sitting room.

37:15.124 --> 37:17.724
Does she know I'm here?
I said that I wasn't sure.

37:17.724 --> 37:19.924
You can't find me.

37:23.164 --> 37:25.004
Get dressed.

37:25.004 --> 37:27.004
Shouldn't you at least say hello?

37:27.004 --> 37:29.484
She'll want to know about Andrew.
I'm not in the mood.

37:33.204 --> 37:35.764
Thank you.
(ENGINE RUMBLES)

37:35.764 --> 37:37.364
Is that a car?

37:37.364 --> 37:41.964
Oh, that's just, uh, one of
the workers' vehicles, ma'am.

37:41.964 --> 37:46.924
Can I bring you anything else?
No, thank you, dear.

37:46.924 --> 37:51.164
Before you go, your brother...

37:51.164 --> 37:55.324
Yes, ma'am?
And Mr James.

37:55.324 --> 37:57.364
Yes?

37:57.364 --> 37:59.724
There's no need to feel awkward.

37:59.724 --> 38:03.604
I'm a woman of the world
and privy to all family secrets.

38:03.604 --> 38:07.404
So tell me, how is
the unfortunate matter proceeding?

38:12.804 --> 38:15.484
The party was a great success
for you at least.

38:15.484 --> 38:17.764
I have rather restored
my social credibility.

38:17.764 --> 38:19.364
Ah, yes. Thank you.

38:19.364 --> 38:23.004
And you mustn't be
a stranger, George.

38:23.004 --> 38:26.604
Whenever you're in town...
Thank you for a splendid day.

38:26.604 --> 38:30.204
It was a pleasure.
Yes, it was.

38:30.204 --> 38:33.684
We were both surprised, I think.
I think we were.

38:35.524 --> 38:40.524
Lovely to see you so recovered.
It's good to be amongst company.

38:40.524 --> 38:42.844
Oh, and all the very best
for your confinement.

38:42.844 --> 38:46.684
We had a marvellous time.
Ah. 'Bye, then.

38:48.484 --> 38:50.884
Thank you.
Don't tell him.

38:50.884 --> 38:52.724
But I...
Not yet.

38:52.724 --> 38:54.484
I've had a thought.

38:55.844 --> 38:58.884
I'd love to visit again,
once the dust has settled.

38:58.884 --> 39:00.724
You'd be most welcome.

39:02.084 --> 39:04.364
Say nothing until we've spoken more.

39:17.484 --> 39:20.004
I apologise for
my earlier suspicions.

39:20.004 --> 39:24.564
You behaved impeccably.
I did, didn't I?

Absolutely.

40:59.924 --> 41:04.044
You'd have known last week if George
hadn't forbidden communication.

41:04.044 --> 41:08.124
And she has no idea?
None at all.

41:08.124 --> 41:10.084
Isn't it delicious?

41:10.084 --> 41:12.084
You've won.

and imagine what he found.

..will detonate on impact.

41:38.244 --> 41:40.484
She says there's proof.
Of what?

41:44.244 --> 41:46.124
(CRIES) Oh, dear God.

41:48.204 --> 41:50.284
Whatever your motives...

41:52.364 --> 41:53.764
..thank you.

you two hadn't gone poking around.
