03:30.533 --> 03:32.133
AFTER THAT,
THEY'RE SENDING ME TO ZAIRE.

03:32.133 --> 03:34.800

04:29.767 --> 04:30.833

04:30.833 --> 04:32.100
SHE'S GONNA BE A NUN NOW.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.733
- I KNOW;
I CAN'T.

04:33.733 --> 04:34.733
SHE'S A NUN.

04:34.733 --> 04:37.233
I FEEL WEIRD.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.500
HEY, HOW COME

04:38.500 --> 04:41.233
ANY CRUCIFIXES

OR SOMETHING.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.100
- WHAT?

04:48.100 --> 04:49.100

04:49.100 --> 04:50.367
WHILE SHE'S HERE,

04:50.367 --> 04:51.833
I'M THINKING
MAYBE WE SHOULD BOTH

04:51.833 --> 04:52.833
TRY TO BE
A LITTLE MORE...

04:52.833 --> 04:55.433
[singing] AH, AH...

04:55.433 --> 04:56.700

05:05.833 --> 05:07.500
THIS IS JUST HER LATEST PHASE.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.000

I WENT THROUGH THAT.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.300
YEAH.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.367

SHE DOES TO GET ATTENTION,

05:14.367 --> 05:15.900
SO I WANT YOU
TO JUST IGNORE IT, OKAY?

05:15.900 --> 05:17.467
- HOW CAN I--

05:17.467 --> 05:19.233
- JUST DON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL

06:16.367 --> 06:19.067
WHOSE HEART ARE YOU
BREAKING THESE DAYS?

06:19.067 --> 06:20.633

06:20.633 --> 06:23.300
SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THAT I'M MARRIED TO GOD.

06:33.900 --> 06:38.533

LET ME TAKE IT.

06:52.433 --> 06:53.500

ABOUT HER

06:55.900 --> 07:00.067
EXCITING NEW BUSINESS?

- OH, I'VE SEEN IT
A THOUSAND TIMES.

07:45.033 --> 07:46.267
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE

07:46.267 --> 07:49.033
THE HILLS REALLY
ARE ALIVE.

07:51.100 --> 07:54.167
AND I LIKE WHEN JULIE ANDREWS

[knocking at door]

08:13.633 --> 08:16.567
HEY.

08:38.567 --> 08:41.233

I LOVE THAT SONG.

08:43.833 --> 08:46.267
I JUST--

08:46.267 --> 08:47.733

I WANT TO MAKE 6:30 MASS

08:48.833 --> 08:50.333

08:51.233 --> 08:53.367
IS GOD EVEN UP THEN?

08:53.367 --> 08:55.233

6:30 IN THE MORNING.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.367
THAT'S WHAT TIME
SHE USED TO GO TO BED.

09:16.367 --> 09:18.600
WHERE DID SHE
GET THIS FROM?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.233
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:20.233 --> 09:23.033
MAYBE YOUR SISTER
GOT ONE OF THOSE CALLINGS.

09:23.033 --> 09:24.200
- YEAH, WELL,

09:24.200 --> 09:25.233
THEN THAT CALL
WAS ON HOLD

09:25.233 --> 09:29.500
WHILE SHE DATED THE WHO.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.233
- WHY IS THIS BOTHERING YOU
SO MUCH?

09:31.233 --> 09:32.233
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:32.233 --> 09:33.933
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

09:33.933 --> 09:35.267
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

09:35.267 --> 09:36.267
I'M TOO STUPID.

09:36.267 --> 09:37.467
I WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

09:37.467 --> 09:38.900
YEAH.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.300
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE SO COMPLICATED, YOU KNOW?

09:41.300 --> 09:45.700
YOU'RE MAD AT HER,
AND IT'S SO OBVIOUS WHY.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.600
- GO AHEAD.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.033
- YOU'RE MAD AT HER
BECAUSE...

09:52.567 --> 09:55.400
SHE DATED THE WHO.

09:56.567 --> 09:57.767
NO, WAIT.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.033
I KNOW.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.467
I KNOW.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.733
I--YOU--YOU ARE
SO VERY MAD AT HER

10:03.733 --> 10:05.567
BECAUSE...

10:05.567 --> 10:06.700
YOU...

10:06.700 --> 10:07.800
ARE NOT...

10:07.800 --> 10:10.533
THE GOOD SISTER ANYMORE.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.633
- WHAT?

10:12.633 --> 10:15.000
- AHA HA!

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
THAT'S IT.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.367
THAT'S IT.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.833
YOU ALWAYS USED TO BE
THE GOOD ONE,

10:18.833 --> 10:20.333
AND JENNIFER
WAS THE BAD ONE.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.267
BUT NOW
SHE'S BECOMING A NUN,

10:22.267 --> 10:25.633
WHICH MAKES HER
THE REALLY GOOD ONE.

10:25.633 --> 10:28.400
SHE WINS.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.300
- THAT'S NOT IT.
- THEN WHAT IS IT?

10:30.300 --> 10:31.867
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

10:31.867 --> 10:34.267
- YOU JUST DON'T LIKE
ME BEING RIGHT, RIGHT?

10:34.267 --> 10:36.233
YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO ANALYZE ME UP AND DOWN,

10:36.233 --> 10:40.700
BUT I--I HIT ON
A PSYCHOLOGICAL UNDERCOATING

10:40.700 --> 10:46.000
AND--AND YOU CAN'T GIVE ME
MY DUE.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.367
- YOU'RE A GENIUS,
PROFESSOR.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.867
- SO WHAT?

10:51.867 --> 10:53.033
SO YOU'RE THE BAD ONE.

10:53.033 --> 10:56.300
SO WHAT?

10:56.300 --> 11:00.100
I PREFER THE BAD ONE.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.567
THE BAD ONES ARE NAUGHTY.

11:09.567 --> 11:10.633
- OH.

11:10.633 --> 11:13.200
GET OFF OF ME, RAY.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.367
- OKAY, BAD GIRL--

11:15.367 --> 11:16.167
- RAY!

11:16.167 --> 11:17.733
- ALL RIGHT.

11:22.667 --> 11:25.267
ALL ALONE IN RIGHTVILLE.

11:32.733 --> 11:36.400
- OH, THIS SALAD
IS SO WONDERFUL, JENNIFER.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.500
IT MAY BE THE BEST SALAD
I'VE EVER EATEN.

11:43.467 --> 11:45.767
- EXCUSE ME, SISTER JENNIFER.

11:45.767 --> 11:46.967
MIGHTN'T I TROUBLE YOU

11:46.967 --> 11:49.500
TO PASS THE PEAS
THIS WAY, PERCHANCE?

11:51.367 --> 11:54.233
- SHE'S NOT THE QUEEN,
FRANK.

11:54.233 --> 11:57.033
- HOW ABOUT NOT TALKING
WITH YOUR MOUTH FULL?

11:57.033 --> 12:01.500
- HOW ABOUT YOU JUMPIN'--

12:01.500 --> 12:05.533
I'M JUST TRYING
TO ENJOY GOD'S BOUNTY.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.400
- LET ME HELP YOU, DEB.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.067
- OH, THAT'S OKAY,
I GOT IT.

12:11.067 --> 12:12.600
SO YOU WANT DESSERT
NOW OR LATER?

12:12.600 --> 12:15.000
- OH, NOW, DEAR,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.267
'CAUSE I HAVE SOMETHING
EXTRA-SPECIAL FOR JENNIFER

12:17.267 --> 12:18.867
ACROSS THE STREET.

12:18.867 --> 12:19.867
- I ALREADY HAVE--

12:19.867 --> 12:21.533
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:22.767 --> 12:24.667
- MARIE, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE BOTHERED.

12:24.667 --> 12:25.700
- OH, NONSENSE.

12:25.700 --> 12:26.800
IT ISN'T EVERY DAY

12:26.800 --> 12:29.200
THAT WE HAVE SOMEONE
LIKE YOU WITH US.

12:30.233 --> 12:34.533
- RAY, WOULD YOU STOP IT?

12:34.533 --> 12:35.967
- SO, UH,

12:35.967 --> 12:38.633
SISTER JENNIFER, UH,

12:38.633 --> 12:39.933
MAY I ASK YOU A QUESTION

12:39.933 --> 12:42.900
THAT'S BEEN ON MY MIND
FOR QUITE SOME TIME?

12:42.900 --> 12:44.767
- SURE, FRANK.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.233
- IT'S A RARE OPPORTUNITY

12:46.233 --> 12:49.500
FOR ME TO TALK TO SOMEONE
OF YOUR VOCATION,

12:49.500 --> 12:51.700
WHICH LEADS ME
TO MY QUESTION.

12:51.700 --> 12:55.833
WHAT DO YOU GALS WEAR
UNDER THERE?

12:55.833 --> 12:57.100
- DAD.
- DAD!

12:57.100 --> 12:58.533
- WHAT?

12:58.533 --> 13:01.167
- WE CAN'T DISCUSS RELIGION
AT THE TABLE?

13:03.767 --> 13:09.100
- DEB, DEB, DEB, DEB.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.800
DEB.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.933
- WHAT?

13:12.933 --> 13:14.600
- DON'T PRETEND WITH ME.

13:16.767 --> 13:17.933
I ONLY KNOW TOO WELL

13:17.933 --> 13:22.067
THE PAIN OF BEING
NUMBER TWO.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.933
- WHAT DID RAY TELL YOU?

13:23.933 --> 13:25.267
- ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR SISTER?

13:25.267 --> 13:27.067
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.267
I'VE SEEN
THAT FACE BEFORE

13:29.267 --> 13:32.400
IN THE MIRROR.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.733
- NO, MY SISTER AND I

13:33.733 --> 13:35.767
DON'T HAVE THAT KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.433
- OH, NO?

13:37.433 --> 13:40.967
IT STARTS THE FIRST DAY
THEY BRING THE NEW ONE HOME.

13:40.967 --> 13:42.667
THERE YOU ARE,
INNOCENTLY PLAYING

13:42.667 --> 13:45.000
WITH YOUR BONGO MONKEY.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.933
ALL THE RELATIVES

13:55.933 --> 14:00.100
JUST OOHING AND AHHING
OVER THE NEW LITTLE BLESSING.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.500
SO CUTE, SO--

14:01.500 --> 14:04.067
SO PRECIOUS.

14:04.067 --> 14:06.567
THEN MAMA'S DARLING
BEGINS TO CRY.

14:06.567 --> 14:08.133
SOMEONE COMES UP WITH
THE BRIGHT IDEA

14:08.133 --> 14:10.767
OF GIVING HIM YOUR BONGO.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.967
"THAT'LL CALM HIM DOWN."

14:12.967 --> 14:14.733
AND FROM THAT DAY FORWARD,

14:14.733 --> 14:17.100
SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR MONKEY
AND ASSUME THE POSITION.

14:17.100 --> 14:20.233
YOU ARE NOW NUMBER TWO.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.033
- I'M THE YOUNGER ONE, ROBERT.

14:23.033 --> 14:25.967
- WHAT'S THAT?

14:25.967 --> 14:27.267
- I'M THE YOUNGEST.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.533
THEY WOULD BE GIVING ME
THE BONGO MONKEY.

14:29.533 --> 14:31.567
- OH.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.433
WELL, IT'S JUST
A VERY GENERAL STORY

14:33.433 --> 14:37.933
INTENDED TO ILLUMINATE
THE HUMAN CONDITION.

14:37.933 --> 14:39.767
- THANK YOU.

14:39.767 --> 14:42.533
- GIVE ME MORE THAN RAY.

14:45.900 --> 14:49.000
OKAY, WHO WANTS ICE CREAM?

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
- THANK YOU.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.167
- UH-HUH.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.300
- HERE WE GO.

15:00.567 --> 15:05.000
A SPECIAL CAKE
FOR A SPECIAL SOMEONE.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.100
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.967
- WELL, IT WAS MADE
WITH LOVE

15:08.967 --> 15:12.467
IN HONOR OF THE SACRIFICES
YOU'RE MAKING FOR US.

15:13.933 --> 15:15.533
- IS THERE
A SPECIAL DESSERT GRACE,

15:15.533 --> 15:19.267
OR CAN WE JUST
CHOP THIS THING UP?

15:19.267 --> 15:20.600
- LET'S DIG IN.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.333
I'M SURE I WON'T BE
SEEING MUCH CAKE

15:22.333 --> 15:24.133
LIKE THIS IN ZAIRE.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.833
- HA, ZAIRE.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.133
- WHAT?

15:27.133 --> 15:28.633
- YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
GO TO ZAIRE

15:28.633 --> 15:30.667
AND GIVE UP CAKE AND
DOUBLE STUFFED OREOS AND MEN?

15:30.667 --> 15:32.400
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
I CAN'T DO IT?

15:32.400 --> 15:35.667
- OH, I JUST THINK THAT
BEFORE YOU BECOME A NUN

15:35.667 --> 15:37.200
AND MOVE TO ZAIRE,

15:37.200 --> 15:38.600
YOU MIGHT WANT TO

15:38.600 --> 15:41.033
YOU KNOW, TRY THIS
LIFESTYLE OUT FOR,

15:41.033 --> 15:42.700
OH, A WEEKEND.

15:44.267 --> 15:46.533
- DEBRA, I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS APPROPRIATE.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.533
- [singing] ME NEITHER.

15:55.267 --> 15:56.733
- NOT APPROPRIATE?

15:56.733 --> 15:57.900
OKAY, JEN,

15:57.900 --> 15:59.133
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US

15:59.133 --> 16:01.600
WHAT IS APPROPRIATE
NUN BEHAVIOR?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.367
- OKAY? UM...

16:03.367 --> 16:04.367
HMM.

16:04.367 --> 16:06.033
SMOKING?

16:06.033 --> 16:08.700
- YOU SMOKE?

16:08.700 --> 16:09.833
- I USED TO SMOKE.

16:09.833 --> 16:11.533
- YEAH, EVERYBODY
AT HER COMMUNE SMOKED.

16:11.533 --> 16:14.100
SOMETIMES THOSE FUNNY
LITTLE CIGARETTES, HMM?

16:14.100 --> 16:15.500
- [gasps]

16:17.433 --> 16:20.767
- HEY, HOW COME ROBERT'S
GOT MORE ICE CREAM THAN ME?

16:27.500 --> 16:31.800
- YOU WERE
A POT-SMOKING HIPPIE?

16:31.800 --> 16:33.000
- NO, IT WAS JUST A PLACE

16:33.000 --> 16:34.300
WHERE PEOPLE
COULD LIVE TOGETHER

16:34.300 --> 16:37.467
AND GROW ORGANIC VEGETABLES.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.400
- NAKED.

16:41.767 --> 16:45.000
- YOU HANDLED FOOD NAKED?

16:46.567 --> 16:49.100
- THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ORGANIC.

16:56.500 --> 17:00.133
- YEAH, THE HILLS
WERE REALLY ALIVE THEN.

17:00.133 --> 17:02.167
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

17:02.167 --> 17:03.700
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

17:08.167 --> 17:09.767
- EXCUSE ME.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.367
[knocking at door]

17:28.700 --> 17:30.167
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:30.167 --> 17:31.167
- DO YOU MIND?

17:31.167 --> 17:32.167
I'D LIKE TO BE ALONE.

17:32.167 --> 17:33.200
- COME ON, YOU WANT TO TALK?

17:33.200 --> 17:34.567
- NO, COULD YOU GO?

17:35.800 --> 17:38.500
- MAKE ME.

17:38.500 --> 17:42.533
- I WOULD,
BUT YOU'RE A NUN NOW.

17:42.533 --> 17:44.367
- I'LL PUT THE VOWS
ON HOLD FOR A SECOND.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.567
YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?

17:46.567 --> 17:47.700
- VOWS.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.100
- HEY, KNOCK IT OFF.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.400
I KNOW
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT,

17:50.400 --> 17:52.367
BUT I HAPPEN TO BE
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

17:52.367 --> 17:53.167
- WHY?

17:53.167 --> 17:54.467
- WHAT, WHY AM I BECOMING A NUN?

17:54.467 --> 17:55.967
- YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME?

17:55.967 --> 17:57.500
- BECAUSE I WANT TO BE
BETTER THAN YOU.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.833
- WHAT?

18:02.833 --> 18:06.033
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY
WE ALL BECOME NUNS.

18:07.267 --> 18:09.333
- I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT WAS IT.

18:09.333 --> 18:11.200
- CHOCOLATE, HUH?

18:11.200 --> 18:13.500
STILL GOT A SECRET STASH?

18:13.500 --> 18:16.367
- SO WHAT?

18:16.367 --> 18:19.067
- I ALWAYS KNEW WHERE IT WAS.

18:19.067 --> 18:21.800
YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE SO COOL,

18:21.800 --> 18:23.900
HIDING YOUR HALLOWEEN CANDY,

18:23.900 --> 18:26.033
EATING JUST A LITTLE BIT

18:26.033 --> 18:29.300
SO IT WOULD LAST LONGER
THAN MINE.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.700
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE IT WAS.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.233
- OH, BOY,
THIS IS THE HARD STUFF.

18:41.233 --> 18:44.100
YOU MUST REALLY BE UPSET.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.867
- WELL, EXCUSE ME,
BUT I'M NOT THE ONE

18:45.867 --> 18:47.067
THAT JUST DROPPED IN
TO SAY,

18:47.067 --> 18:48.200
"OH, HI, I'M BECOMING A NUN.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.700
SO LONG, SUCKERS."

18:50.700 --> 18:53.333
- DEBRA, THIS HAS BEEN COMING
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.700
- YEAH, WELL,
HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT,

18:54.700 --> 18:56.333
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN TWO YEARS

18:56.333 --> 18:57.933
AND BARELY BEFORE THAT.

18:57.933 --> 18:59.133
AND SINCE COLLEGE,
YOU DON'T EVEN KEEP IN TOUCH.

18:59.133 --> 19:00.467
- I WAS MOVING AROUND A LOT.

19:00.467 --> 19:02.167
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WANTED TO DO.

19:02.167 --> 19:04.200
- OH, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU KNOW.

19:04.200 --> 19:07.100
- I HAVE KNOWN
FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF.

19:07.100 --> 19:10.867
I'VE HAD A FEW WEEKENDS
AT THIS.

19:10.867 --> 19:12.567
- OKAY, FINE.

19:12.567 --> 19:13.833
FINE.

19:13.833 --> 19:16.067
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S BOTHERING ME.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.867
WHAT'S BOTHERING ME
IS...

19:17.867 --> 19:19.200
- WHAT?

19:20.267 --> 19:22.233
- YOU WEREN'T AROUND,

19:22.233 --> 19:24.067
AND I WAS OKAY,

19:24.067 --> 19:27.767
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT
SOMEDAY YOU WOULD,

19:27.767 --> 19:29.500
YOU KNOW.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.367
AND--

19:31.367 --> 19:33.533
SO I'VE BEEN WAITING,

19:33.533 --> 19:36.500
AND NOW YOU'RE
LEAVING FOR GOOD.

19:38.800 --> 19:43.267
I WANT A SISTER.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.033
NOT A SISTER SISTER.

19:45.033 --> 19:48.000
A SISTER.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.667
- I'M STILL YOUR SISTER.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.700
- NO, YOU'RE
ZAIRE'S SISTER.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.400
I MEAN, RAY AND ROBERT,
THEY HAVE THIS, LIKE,

19:56.400 --> 19:57.900
COMPLETELY SCREWED-UP
RELATIONSHIP,

19:57.900 --> 20:00.333
BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE
EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW?

20:00.333 --> 20:01.767
I MEAN, THEY FIGHT
AND THEY COMPETE,

20:01.767 --> 20:03.900
AND THEY BLAME THEIR LIVES
ON THEIR PARENTS.

20:03.900 --> 20:06.233
THEY'RE REAL BROTHERS.

20:12.100 --> 20:16.733
- YOU KNOW,
DAD STILL DRINKS.

20:16.733 --> 20:18.033
- THAT'S SWEET,

20:18.033 --> 20:20.033
BUT I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.233
- LISTEN, I KNOW
HOW FLAKY I'VE BEEN,

20:25.233 --> 20:26.767
BUT THIS IS RIGHT
FOR ME.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.833
JUST LIKE YOU KNEW
THIS LIFE WAS RIGHT FOR YOU

20:28.833 --> 20:30.133
WHEN YOU MET RAY.

20:30.133 --> 20:31.467
- YEAH, BUT YOU GET TO
GO TO ZAIRE,

20:31.467 --> 20:35.700
AND I'M STUCK HERE
WITH HIS FAMILY.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.933
THE BARONES COULD USE
YOUR HELP, TOO, YOU KNOW.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.133
- I CAN'T WORK MIRACLES.

20:40.133 --> 20:42.433
- [laughs]

20:47.800 --> 20:49.433
[sighs]

20:49.433 --> 20:53.133
THEN YOU BETTER
PRAY FOR ME.

20:58.567 --> 20:59.933
- THAT'S IT?

20:59.933 --> 21:01.000
THAT'S IT FOR THE ICE CREAM?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
THAT'S ALL WE HAD?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.633
AW, GREAT.

21:05.300 --> 21:07.067
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

21:07.067 --> 21:09.000
- NOTHING, I JUST WANTED
A LITTLE MORE ICE CREAM,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
THAT'S ALL.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.233
I HARDLY HAD ANY.

21:11.233 --> 21:12.933
I JUST WANTED
A LITTLE MORE ICE CREAM.

21:12.933 --> 21:13.933
NOTHING.

21:13.933 --> 21:15.700
I--I HAD SQUAT.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.767
I HAD NOTHING.

21:17.767 --> 21:18.933
NOTHING ICE CREAM.

21:18.933 --> 21:20.167
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

21:20.167 --> 21:22.633
QUIT WHINING.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.033
- BONGO MONKEY.
