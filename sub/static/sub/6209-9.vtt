WEBVTT

00:03.647 --> 00:05.763
Would you like some more cocoa,
Aunt Zelda?

00:05.927 --> 00:08.282
Not until I know why
you're doing all this.

00:08.487 --> 00:10.762
I just want you guys to relax.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.326
And I want my own car.

00:13.407 --> 00:14.396
- No.
- No.

00:14.567 --> 00:17.286
Then you leave me no choice. Here.

00:18.487 --> 00:20.443
A C in History?

00:20.607 --> 00:23.246
- I got a C because I don't have a car.
- That happened to me once.

00:23.407 --> 00:25.796
I got a D because my dad
wouldn't get me a rocket.

00:25.967 --> 00:27.525
I had a report due
on the Freedom Trail.

00:27.687 --> 00:30.645
I had to go to the stupid Freedom Trail
but my ride to Boston fell through,

00:30.807 --> 00:32.286
so I ran out of time.

00:32.447 --> 00:34.517
Sabrina, you cannot blame
your circumstances

00:34.687 --> 00:35.961
for not getting your work done.

00:37.427 --> 00:40.066
If there are obstacles in your path,
go around them.

00:40.227 --> 00:41.216
That's right.

00:41.387 --> 00:44.459
If you can't get to the Freedom Trail,
try a freedom fighter.

00:48.267 --> 00:49.586
Paper on the Freedom Trail?

00:50.787 --> 00:52.664
The Freedom Trail includes
many historical sites

00:52.827 --> 00:53.862
of significance to Boston.

00:54.627 --> 00:56.743
Wouldn't a car have been easier?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:16.627 --> 01:18.663
I'm all tapped out.

01:24.107 --> 01:26.063
I'm coming.

01:27.347 --> 01:28.541
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

01:28.707 --> 01:31.426
- Ready for breakfast?
- Yeah, we're going to Big John's.

01:31.587 --> 01:34.624
If you order the lumberjack special
before 8:30, you get to keep the plate.

01:34.787 --> 01:36.823
If you get there before 8:15,
you get the fork.

01:36.987 --> 01:39.501
Think Big John's is
going out of business?

01:39.707 --> 01:41.902
We're going to the aquarium.
We'll be back by 6.

01:42.067 --> 01:47.266
I'm driving. Oh, no, I'm not.
I don't have a car.

01:47.427 --> 01:49.702
- Nice try, Sabrina.
- Have fun.

01:50.427 --> 01:53.737
- That's weird. It's stuck.
- Are you sure?

01:58.787 --> 02:00.664
What's going on?

02:00.827 --> 02:03.819
I know it sounds crazy,
but the door won't open.

02:03.987 --> 02:05.864
I wonder how that happened?

02:06.067 --> 02:08.535
Oh, dear.
Hilda, would you check the back door?

02:08.707 --> 02:11.744
- Right.
- And I'll try these.

02:13.627 --> 02:15.857
Boy, that's a... Nope.

02:16.627 --> 02:18.697
Hilda. Any luck?

02:18.867 --> 02:21.017
Even the cat door won't open.

02:21.187 --> 02:23.496
Is it time to start worrying
about the oxygen supply?

02:32.427 --> 02:35.066
Hilda, did you mail
that mortgage payment last week?

02:35.227 --> 02:36.740
Of course I did. Didn't I?

02:36.907 --> 02:39.057
Oh, I absolutely... Don't remember.

02:39.787 --> 02:43.462
Well, we're probably in a lockdown.
It's a scare tactic witch lenders use

02:43.627 --> 02:45.822
to remind the customer their payment
is a little late.

02:45.987 --> 02:49.900
Or that their little sister is a little
brain-dead. We've got to go there.

02:50.067 --> 02:51.625
How am I gonna stall Harvey
and Valerie?

02:51.787 --> 02:54.176
- You'll think of something.
- But don't use a mind freeze.

02:54.347 --> 02:56.463
When people are thawed,
they tend to lose the letter R.

02:56.627 --> 02:59.744
- Go around the obstacles, right?
- That's our girl.

03:00.907 --> 03:01.896
Then can I have a car?

03:02.547 --> 03:04.185
- No.
- No.

03:06.307 --> 03:08.104
Sorry, guys.
Our alarm system freaked out.

03:08.267 --> 03:12.340
My aunts went upstairs to check on it,
but we're locked in.

03:12.507 --> 03:14.179
Let me try this thing.

03:22.227 --> 03:24.900
Is this part of the standard
alarm package, or is it extra?

03:25.107 --> 03:27.496
We're not going to Big John's.

03:27.667 --> 03:30.625
That's okay, I'll cook.
And everyone goes home with a knife.

03:30.787 --> 03:32.425
Wait here.

03:36.587 --> 03:40.660
Hello, ladies.
Welcome to Budget Mortgage,

03:40.827 --> 03:43.580
where we forgo the frills
to save you money.

03:45.247 --> 03:46.760
That's why I picked it.

03:46.927 --> 03:51.125
Yes. I'd give you my card,
but that would be a frill.

03:51.287 --> 03:52.925
Our house has been sealed.

03:53.087 --> 03:55.760
Has it started to fill up with sand yet?

03:55.927 --> 03:58.566
- No.
- Well, then it's not a foreclosure.

03:58.727 --> 04:03.243
Probably just a late payment.
Let's have a look-see.

04:05.727 --> 04:11.359
Spellman, okay. P, Q, R...

04:11.527 --> 04:12.721
Coming up.

04:16.166 --> 04:17.918
Freshly zapped orange juice.

04:18.087 --> 04:20.396
Okay, now should I make omelettes
or eggs Benedict?

04:20.567 --> 04:23.718
Well, since I don't know what eggs
Benedict is, I guess I'll make omelettes.

04:23.887 --> 04:25.764
Sabrina.

04:26.447 --> 04:28.756
- Pesky earthquakes.
- We're lonely.

04:28.927 --> 04:30.963
- Yeah, can we hang with you?
- Please don't.

04:31.127 --> 04:34.597
I mean, I can't have you stealing
all my Spellman family recipes.

04:34.767 --> 04:37.520
For eggs? Come on,
you won't even know we're here.

04:38.687 --> 04:42.441
- Okay. So how do you like them?
- Scrambled's fine with me.

04:42.607 --> 04:43.722
Okay, then.

04:43.887 --> 04:48.039
Is that scrambled on top of the stove
or in some sort of casserole?

04:50.807 --> 04:54.720
Seventeen. One-seven.

04:54.887 --> 04:58.675
Five-aught-five.

04:58.887 --> 05:01.276
How do you like this baby, huh?

05:01.447 --> 05:04.996
A lot better than a slide rule,
I'll tell you.

05:06.447 --> 05:08.642
Alrighty.

05:09.367 --> 05:12.518
Well, your payments are up to date.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.723
Then why is our house sealed?

05:14.887 --> 05:17.117
I don't know.

05:17.327 --> 05:19.716
I could run these numbers again...

05:19.887 --> 05:21.479
No!

05:21.647 --> 05:26.721
Or let me see if I can get
the main auditor on the blower.

05:30.007 --> 05:32.726
- I didn't know eggs were flammable.
- No, the potholder's flammable.

05:32.887 --> 05:34.923
It spread to the eggs.

05:36.687 --> 05:39.679
Ethel? Ethel, it's Ed.

05:39.847 --> 05:44.363
Would you please try
plaza 209 for me?

05:45.887 --> 05:50.836
No hurry. We've got all century.

05:56.567 --> 05:58.762
- I'm full.
- Stuffed.

05:58.927 --> 06:02.363
Think you could see how your aunts
are doing with that alarm system?

06:03.487 --> 06:05.000
Oh, alrighty.

06:06.007 --> 06:09.079
You bet. You too.

06:09.247 --> 06:12.284
One more pleasantry,
and Ethel will get hurt.

06:13.447 --> 06:15.324
Yeah, I'll call you later.

06:16.727 --> 06:19.924
What my sister means is,
did you find anything out?

06:20.087 --> 06:23.318
Well, your mortgage has indeed
been fully paid.

06:23.487 --> 06:26.638
You know what you are?
You are... Not helpful.

06:26.807 --> 06:28.604
We are taking our mortgage
elsewhere.

06:28.767 --> 06:31.076
Hilda, it's a 200-year loan
at 1 percent.

06:31.247 --> 06:32.760
I don't care.

06:39.087 --> 06:41.282
Why is it raining pork rinds?

06:41.447 --> 06:45.804
Your house is sealed, and somebody
is dumping salty snacks?

06:46.287 --> 06:49.916
You don't have a mortgage problem.
That's family.

06:50.087 --> 06:54.000
We don't have any relatives
that we have problems with.

06:55.527 --> 06:59.076
- Boyd and Racine.
- Our hillbilly cousins.

07:00.447 --> 07:02.358
Told you.

07:05.367 --> 07:08.325
Do you think it's possible
that your aunts got lost upstairs?

07:08.487 --> 07:10.682
I think I'm getting bedsores.

07:12.327 --> 07:13.316
What was that?

07:13.487 --> 07:15.557
Oh, they're probably off the phone.
I'll go check.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.400
Meanwhile, why don't you guys
go play pool?

07:18.567 --> 07:19.841
- You have a pool table?
- Yeah.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.795
- Right through there in the parlour.
- That's awesome. Let's play.

07:25.447 --> 07:29.281
- Wow, it looks brand-new.
- Why were we playing cards?

07:30.767 --> 07:33.759
- Finally. Can we leave now?
- Unfortunately, no.

07:34.927 --> 07:37.839
Our cousins, Racine and Boyd,
have put a lockdown on the house.

07:38.007 --> 07:40.521
But the good news is,
I did pay the mortgage.

07:40.687 --> 07:42.996
- Racine and Boyd?
- They're relatives you haven't met yet,

07:43.167 --> 07:46.045
because they're horrible.
They're just horrible.

07:46.207 --> 07:49.040
They're mad because Great-Granny
left us the magic book in her will.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.675
They tend to lash out
if they have a bad night at bingo.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.725
But they can still do magic... I mean,
they sealed this house pretty well.

07:55.887 --> 07:58.765
Well, on Earth a little magic goes
a long way, but in the Other Realm

07:58.927 --> 08:01.760
it's about as impressive
as hanging a spoon from your nose.

08:03.247 --> 08:05.397
It must be hard for them to manage
in the Other Realm

08:05.567 --> 08:06.556
without the magic book.

08:06.727 --> 08:10.163
Why, it would be like
an American teenager without a car.

08:10.687 --> 08:11.676
I have to hand it to her.

08:11.847 --> 08:14.315
Even in a panic situation,
she managed to pitch that car.

08:14.487 --> 08:17.285
We have to do something.
I have mortals in the parlour.

08:17.447 --> 08:18.960
- We don't have a parlour.
- We do now.

08:19.127 --> 08:22.119
Calm down.
These feuds don't last forever.

08:22.287 --> 08:24.801
It'll probably be over in a year or two.

08:24.967 --> 08:27.686
- What?
- We'll think of a solution over lunch.

08:27.847 --> 08:29.565
We'll eat in.

08:32.807 --> 08:35.684
- Who could that be?
- Probably Racine and Boyd.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.485
I just invited them for lunch.

08:38.527 --> 08:41.599
Lord have mercy.
Look at the number of towels.

08:41.767 --> 08:44.280
It's like there's one towel
for each person.

08:48.167 --> 08:50.886
It's a good thing you folks have such
a fancy place

08:51.047 --> 08:53.117
because you ain't never leaving it.

08:53.287 --> 08:55.926
- Hi, I'm Sabrina.
- We're sitting in our recliners

08:56.087 --> 09:00.365
in our own front yard, and suddenly
we're conjured to the mortal realm.

09:02.227 --> 09:04.263
What would you call that, Maw Maw?

09:04.427 --> 09:05.701
Rude.

09:06.387 --> 09:09.936
- You must be Racine.
- And that's Boyd, Racine's husband.

09:10.107 --> 09:13.861
And Boyd's mother, Maw Maw.
That's her given name.

09:14.987 --> 09:19.583
Sabrina wanted us to invite you over
so that we could talk about this feud.

09:19.747 --> 09:22.739
At lunch. Didn't somebody
say something about lunch?

09:22.907 --> 09:26.183
Hey, I got dressed.
They better be feeding us.

09:29.067 --> 09:31.979
Maw Maw. The towel.

09:34.787 --> 09:37.176
Well, so far, so good.

09:42.147 --> 09:44.820
Well, look at what
the magic book can do.

09:44.987 --> 09:48.218
This place looks like the Taj Mahal
with indoor plumbing.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.060
Sorry, folks.
Graceland is closed today.

09:51.227 --> 09:54.299
You know, cat make real nice jerky.

09:55.787 --> 09:57.823
Okay, well,
how about we start this visit off right?

09:57.987 --> 10:00.865
I'll get everyone some iced tea,
and you guys can unseal the house.

10:01.027 --> 10:04.861
How about I take my iced tea
with a little sugar and a magic book?

10:05.027 --> 10:08.497
Oh, well, that's certainly in the spirit
of compromise.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.578
Can't you ever talk
like a normal person?

10:10.747 --> 10:12.977
This from a woman who says "can't"?

10:14.147 --> 10:16.058
I think we'll feel better
once we eat something.

10:16.227 --> 10:17.296
The dining room's that way.

10:17.467 --> 10:21.426
- Oh, no TV trays?
- What is this, Christmas?

10:22.587 --> 10:24.145
I don't care how many times
you beat me,

10:24.307 --> 10:27.982
- I'm not calling you Westbridge Slim.
- Okay. How about just Slim?

10:29.147 --> 10:30.546
Is the alarm fixed yet?

10:30.707 --> 10:32.584
- Not yet.
- We should call the fire department.

10:32.747 --> 10:34.066
- They have axes.
- No.

10:34.227 --> 10:38.266
What Sabrina means is... No.
The alarm company's working on it.

10:38.427 --> 10:39.826
Well, what about the police?

10:39.987 --> 10:42.547
- Why don't you stay for lunch?
- What?

10:42.707 --> 10:46.063
Lt'll be all right. I'll warn...
Tell our guests.

10:46.867 --> 10:48.744
- You have guests?
- Cousins.

10:48.947 --> 10:50.619
How did they get in
if we can't get out?

10:50.787 --> 10:52.982
Oh, well, they got here last night.

10:53.147 --> 10:54.865
They just woke up now. Jet lag.

10:55.027 --> 10:58.224
- Where are they from?
- Hong Kong.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.576
- What is this?
- I don't know.

11:02.747 --> 11:05.420
Something expensive, I reckon.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.857
Look at that. Their own still.

11:11.067 --> 11:13.183
Don't touch that!

11:14.547 --> 11:17.141
I'm sorry.
It's just very sensitive equipment.

11:17.307 --> 11:20.902
Sure, sure.
Put us down for two jugs.

11:24.627 --> 11:26.902
Listen, before we zap in lunch,
I want you to know

11:27.067 --> 11:28.978
that Sabrina's mortal friends
will be joining us.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.785
Oh, Lord. Don't tell Maw Maw.

11:30.947 --> 11:32.744
Maw Maw don't break bread
with no mortals.

11:33.907 --> 11:37.104
- Well, Sabrina's half mortal.
- Oh, Lord. Don't tell Maw Maw.

11:37.267 --> 11:40.737
Well, we won't tell Maw Maw
if you won't do magic at lunch. Deal?

11:40.907 --> 11:46.698
Are those fancy sort of rules
one might find in, say, a magic book?

11:48.467 --> 11:49.741
Right this way.

11:55.267 --> 11:59.146
Here, just in case you need to divert
Harvey and Valerie's attention.

12:00.747 --> 12:03.625
"Astonish Mints"?
"One fact enthrals for hours."

12:03.787 --> 12:05.220
You really think
I'm gonna need these?

12:05.387 --> 12:06.706
Bring on the grub!

12:06.867 --> 12:10.177
Like I said, just in case.

12:13.427 --> 12:17.261
My, that's quite an impressive hat,
Boyd.

12:17.427 --> 12:21.136
- I wish you wouldn't wear that.
- It is just a touch silly.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.185
It'd be fine if we could afford
brand-name soda.

12:24.347 --> 12:26.622
But with bargain soda,
he looks like a fool.

12:26.827 --> 12:29.057
Grown man
with cheap soda on his head.

12:29.227 --> 12:32.378
What message does that send?
I'll tell you what message:

12:32.547 --> 12:35.061
"This man's got no magic book."

12:35.227 --> 12:37.536
- Magic book?
- <i>TV Guide.</i>

12:37.707 --> 12:39.106
Hong Kongians.

12:39.267 --> 12:41.735
Anybody mind
if I zap in something fried?

12:41.907 --> 12:43.659
You're talking about using
a microwave, right?

12:43.827 --> 12:46.136
I mean,
there's nothing magical about that.

12:46.307 --> 12:50.141
Baked potato in six minutes.
That's pretty magical.

12:50.307 --> 12:52.343
So tell us what it's like
living in Hong Kong.

12:52.507 --> 12:54.702
What is your little mortal friend
talking about?

12:54.867 --> 12:57.381
Mortal? I ain't sitting next to it.

12:57.547 --> 12:58.900
- Mortal?
- Mint?

12:59.067 --> 13:02.104
- Is it my breath?
- Yeah, Harvey, you too.

13:03.867 --> 13:08.543
Anyone ever been astonished
by the number nine?

13:11.287 --> 13:13.198
Me.

13:13.367 --> 13:17.246
Three times nine is 27,
which is two and seven...

13:17.407 --> 13:21.798
And two and seven equals nine.
That's astonishing.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.878
I have a calculator up in my room?

13:24.127 --> 13:25.879
Race you?

13:27.367 --> 13:30.325
To think I mixed with mortals.

13:30.487 --> 13:33.559
Now I can't be buried
in the family crypt.

13:35.847 --> 13:37.326
The problem you have with mortals

13:37.487 --> 13:39.159
is the same problem
you have with my aunts.

13:39.327 --> 13:41.795
What?
Mortals have the magic book?

13:41.967 --> 13:44.640
No. You feud with my aunts
because you don't understand them.

13:44.807 --> 13:46.320
And they have a magic book.

13:46.807 --> 13:49.196
You have to see things
from the other person's point of view.

13:49.367 --> 13:51.323
I think I see both sides
because I'm half mortal.

13:51.967 --> 13:56.085
I knew it.
Those eyes are too far apart.

13:58.407 --> 14:01.240
So since everything's reversed,
when I look into a mirror,

14:01.407 --> 14:04.877
I'm not seeing what you see
when you look at me.

14:05.047 --> 14:08.960
Exactly. You look nothing like that.

14:09.127 --> 14:11.004
That's astonishing.

14:18.027 --> 14:22.703
I want to work. It's just hard
when you ain't got no magic book.

14:22.867 --> 14:24.778
Or a grammar book.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.381
We'll get more pudding.
And crackers.

14:27.547 --> 14:29.458
You seem to like that combination.

14:29.627 --> 14:31.140
I know what you mean. I want a car.

14:31.307 --> 14:33.025
Oh, just like Boyd wants a job.

14:33.187 --> 14:36.975
- Exactly. But I don't have the money.
- Just like we don't have a magic book.

14:38.147 --> 14:39.978
Right. See, now we're understanding
each other.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.865
This is the beginning
of working things out.

14:42.027 --> 14:44.860
Well, I'm glad to see someone
understands our troubles.

14:45.027 --> 14:47.177
I do. I know how tough it is
to make it on your own.

14:47.347 --> 14:49.224
I mean, my aunts told me
I have to earn the car,

14:49.387 --> 14:51.025
but it's hard to get a job
when you're 17.

14:51.187 --> 14:54.418
Are you implying that Boyd
shouldn't have trouble finding work?

14:54.587 --> 14:56.623
No, I meant it's hard for me
because I'm in school.

14:56.787 --> 15:00.177
Oh, so now you're throwing
your education up in our face.

15:01.587 --> 15:04.021
I bet you think
we're nothing but witch trash.

15:04.187 --> 15:06.542
That's not what I meant.
I'm the one who sympathises with you.

15:06.707 --> 15:07.696
- Really?
- Absolutely.

15:07.867 --> 15:10.256
When I think of how much the
book's helped me since I got it.

15:10.867 --> 15:13.017
The mutt has the magic book.

15:13.187 --> 15:15.781
Oh, Maw,
the mortals are taking over the world.

15:15.947 --> 15:18.700
Sabrina, you give us that magic book,
and you give it now.

15:18.867 --> 15:21.256
But I'm studying
for my witch's licence.

15:21.427 --> 15:22.621
Here we are.

15:22.787 --> 15:25.984
Well. I guess there's no more reason
for us to stay.

15:26.627 --> 15:30.461
The magic book has passed hands
and once again, our hands are empty.

15:30.627 --> 15:32.777
Come on, we're missing the <i>Wheel.</i>

15:32.947 --> 15:34.744
Oh, don't go.
Look, there's more pudding.

15:34.907 --> 15:36.056
We got pudding at home.

15:37.627 --> 15:39.857
It may be canned.
It may be government surplus.

15:40.027 --> 15:42.097
I don't know.
It may even be pie filling.

15:42.267 --> 15:43.416
But it's ours.

15:44.627 --> 15:46.345
Don't be a big baby, Boyd.

15:46.507 --> 15:49.180
Unseal this house
and let those mortals go home.

15:49.347 --> 15:51.144
We wouldn't unseal
this highfalutin house

15:51.307 --> 15:53.423
for all the bacon grease in China.

15:55.547 --> 15:57.742
How am I gonna get Valerie
and Harvey out of this house?

15:58.907 --> 16:00.465
I say we fight pork rinds with garbage.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.538
Let's start by pelting them
with rotten tomatoes.

16:02.707 --> 16:04.026
No, no, no.

16:04.227 --> 16:07.185
These Spellmans
will not stoop to their level

16:07.347 --> 16:10.305
no matter how tempting
that might be.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.742
We will not get anywhere
by trying to get...

16:16.067 --> 16:18.023
...even.

16:18.787 --> 16:21.984
This means war.

16:22.187 --> 16:26.863
<i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

16:28.747 --> 16:31.022
- No!
- No!

17:24.747 --> 17:26.499
Are Harvey and Valerie okay?

17:26.666 --> 17:29.704
Yeah, they're still astonished.
It's rather astonishing.

17:30.987 --> 17:32.818
- Hey.
- Oh, no.

17:32.987 --> 17:35.023
Those hayseeds
are messing with gravity.

17:35.187 --> 17:36.939
And yet they can't get a job?

17:37.107 --> 17:41.020
Two can play with the elements.
It's tornado time.

17:42.867 --> 17:44.983
Finally,
we'll see if Racine's hair can move.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.377
Stop. This has gone too far.

17:47.547 --> 17:49.219
I'll just give them back
the magic book.

17:49.387 --> 17:52.060
- I wish you wouldn't.
- Great-Granny.

17:52.267 --> 17:56.146
Do you mind if we get down
from here? I had a big lunch.

17:58.547 --> 18:00.902
Thank you.
And the ceiling needs painting.

18:01.107 --> 18:03.177
Great-Granny,
this is our niece, Sabrina.

18:05.347 --> 18:06.746
Oh, well, aren't you just a dear?

18:06.907 --> 18:09.865
Why in creation
are you looking at me like that?

18:10.027 --> 18:13.099
I'm sorry. It's just...
I thought you were dead.

18:13.267 --> 18:14.586
Is my makeup too pale?

18:14.747 --> 18:17.261
No. You left us the magic book
in your will.

18:17.427 --> 18:21.340
Oh, Sabrina. We witches live so long,
that we go through several wills

18:21.507 --> 18:24.180
just to thin out all the things
we tend to accumulate.

18:24.347 --> 18:25.780
It's our version of a garage sale.

18:25.947 --> 18:29.906
Couldn't we sit down?
It really was a large lunch.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.580
I've heard your side of the story.

18:31.747 --> 18:34.625
Now, I wonder what would be
the right thing to do.

18:35.507 --> 18:39.182
Oh, I know. Hear the other side.

18:44.067 --> 18:47.616
And make it snappy.
I foolishly wore a girdle.

18:47.787 --> 18:50.142
It's all their fault.
They hog the magic book,

18:50.307 --> 18:52.502
then they bring us here
to flaunt their riches.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.259
- Oh, that's not true.
- Liar.

18:54.427 --> 18:56.463
Did you seem them towels up there?

18:58.027 --> 19:01.417
Everybody.
Stop your bellyaching.

19:02.627 --> 19:05.539
And, Boyd,
take off that ridiculous hat.

19:05.707 --> 19:06.822
But, Granny...

19:06.987 --> 19:10.218
Oh, Racine,
I know you're unhappy but it was fair.

19:10.387 --> 19:12.742
Now, Hilda and Zelda
got the magic book,

19:12.907 --> 19:15.785
and you got what you chose:
All my money.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.346
They got all Great-Grandma's
money?

19:17.507 --> 19:20.897
Yep. And they bought a mansion
and a jet and several butlers...

19:21.067 --> 19:23.023
Don't forget tiaras for Maw Maw.

19:23.187 --> 19:24.779
And then all the money was gone.

19:24.947 --> 19:27.939
We didn't just spend it.
We invested some of it.

19:28.107 --> 19:30.940
Yeah. Who knew
Chihuahua racing wouldn't take off?

19:31.107 --> 19:32.699
Everyone?

19:33.867 --> 19:37.257
And I suppose there was no money
left over for a car, right?

19:37.427 --> 19:40.658
Racine, Boyd,
your trouble is not the magic book.

19:40.827 --> 19:43.261
Stop blaming your circumstances.

19:43.427 --> 19:45.895
You've got obstacles.
Go around them.

19:46.787 --> 19:48.266
Yes, I heard her.

19:48.427 --> 19:49.746
I still don't think it's fair.

19:49.907 --> 19:52.296
And did you see all them towels
that they got up in there?

19:52.467 --> 19:54.025
All right.

19:55.187 --> 19:58.623
The next person who interrupts me
is going straight to the corner.

19:58.787 --> 20:00.937
Yes, that's right.
Let Great-Grandmother talk.

20:01.107 --> 20:03.257
Zelda, corner.

20:03.427 --> 20:05.065
But I was just...

20:07.627 --> 20:11.142
Now, get along. Help each other.

20:11.307 --> 20:14.344
Oh, and, Racine, unseal this house.

20:16.867 --> 20:21.543
Finally, I'm free.
I have no place to go.

20:23.907 --> 20:26.023
I think I'll count the towels.

20:30.547 --> 20:33.141
- I'm sorry about the aquarium.
- Oh, who cares?

20:33.307 --> 20:36.663
We still got to look at that rug
in your room.

20:37.267 --> 20:39.827
Look, clouds.

20:46.427 --> 20:49.146
Great-Granny, will you come back
and visit now that you're not dead?

20:49.307 --> 20:52.697
Well, you should come and visit me.
You'd love Florida.

20:53.867 --> 20:56.301
Unless you burn like I do.

20:56.467 --> 20:58.503
May I please be excused?

20:58.667 --> 21:00.783
Not until you've thought about
what I said.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.624
I just wish I could remember
what it was.

21:10.167 --> 21:12.522
I'm not letting my grades suffer
because I don't have a car.

21:12.687 --> 21:13.722
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

21:13.887 --> 21:16.355
Taking the bus to the aquarium.
Don't expect me before dark.

21:16.527 --> 21:17.516
Fine.

21:17.727 --> 21:20.241
Don't expect me to be in a good
mood, because I hate the bus.

21:20.407 --> 21:21.726
Try being on the back of a burro

21:21.887 --> 21:23.798
with the rest of your husband's
possessions.

21:23.967 --> 21:26.242
You haven't ridden the bus lately,
have you?

21:26.407 --> 21:28.921
- Any instructions, Aunt Zelda?
- Take a sweater.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.362
Okay. Gotta go.

21:32.407 --> 21:36.161
- Grandma.
- <i>No.</i>
