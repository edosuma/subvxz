WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.174
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.253 --> 00:04.300
My husband.

00:04.421 --> 00:06.970
Nothing you could ever do
could stop my loving you.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.435
Jonathan, Jonathan
Wolverton Randall, finally.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.606
Captain of Dragoons
in the British army,

00:13.680 --> 00:15.523
and your direct ancestor.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.102
<i>Otherwise known as Black Jack.</i>

00:18.936 --> 00:21.780
<i>I heard stories
of a place called Craigh na Dun.</i>

00:23.482 --> 00:26.110
<i>I was no longer in the 20th century.</i>

00:26.777 --> 00:28.279
<i>What was Frank going through?</i>

00:29.112 --> 00:30.455
Claire?

00:31.114 --> 00:32.787
<i>Perhaps I was abducted.</i>

00:34.868 --> 00:36.461
<i>Perhaps I was dead...</i>

00:39.790 --> 00:41.337
<i>Or perhaps, worst of all,</i>

00:43.794 --> 00:45.512
<i>I had left him for another man.</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

02:32.944 --> 02:34.617
Inverness police,
Constable Boyle speaking,

02:34.696 --> 02:36.073
how may I help you?

02:38.575 --> 02:39.918
I see.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.794
Yes, ma'am, I see now.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.089
When did you first notice
the items were missing?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.053
He's back.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.930
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

02:54.216 --> 02:56.514
I think today's the day.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.803
Today, sir?

02:57.886 --> 02:59.604
I have let this go on long enough.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.057
Today, Sergeant.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.953
Good luck.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.289
Yes, ma'am,
I heard every word you said.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.617
I'm gonna send a man
over straightaway.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.469
I am sorry, Mr. Randall, you know,

03:32.212 --> 03:34.010
I'm very, very sorry.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.638
Please believe me when I say

03:36.717 --> 03:39.311
I wish there was more
that we could do.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.472
Well, there's your job,

03:42.597 --> 03:44.645
perhaps you would do that.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.025
I know this must be
disappointing to you.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.606
Disappointing?

03:51.314 --> 03:52.816
That's an interesting word.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.829
It suggests expectations
that were unmet.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.241
My expectations
of your department were

04:01.324 --> 04:02.576
low to begin with,

04:02.659 --> 04:04.377
and I can assure you

04:04.453 --> 04:07.002
that you have met those
expectations at every turn.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.924
We have spent the past six weeks

04:13.003 --> 04:15.927
searching over
100 square miles of rugged terrain,

04:16.005 --> 04:18.850
conducted 175 interviews...

04:18.966 --> 04:20.469
Invested over 1,000 man hours.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.771
I know the litany, detective,
but tell me,

04:22.846 --> 04:24.848
what do you have to show for these,

04:24.931 --> 04:26.057
for these efforts?

04:30.812 --> 04:31.904
My wife has disappeared.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.574
Do you have any idea at all

04:39.029 --> 04:40.827
what might have happened to her?

04:43.408 --> 04:45.581
We haven't found a body.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.788
Now, that tells me
that she's probably still alive.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.044
No blood in the car,
no sign of a struggle,

04:50.332 --> 04:52.209
now, that tells me that

04:52.876 --> 04:55.299
she probably wasn't taken
against her will.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.465
Yeah, your favorite theory.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.808
You personally witnessed

05:00.550 --> 05:02.723
a man staring up at her window

05:02.803 --> 05:04.146
the night before she disappeared.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.315
I have said from the very beginning

05:06.389 --> 05:08.562
that the Highlander
is certainly involved in some way.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.402
Of course he's involved, you fool.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.732
He's her lover,
and the two of them left together.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.401
My wife is not with another man.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.095
Ask you a question?

05:46.429 --> 05:47.476
Of course.

05:50.934 --> 05:54.108
Well, my question,
I don't wish to, that is...

05:55.772 --> 05:57.274
I don't mean to imply
that you have some

05:58.692 --> 06:00.786
vast knowledge of men,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.538
but well, you know more
than I do in such matters.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.035
Out with it.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.455
Is it usual,

06:12.622 --> 06:15.341
what it is between us
when I touch you,

06:17.294 --> 06:19.717
when you lie with me?

06:21.548 --> 06:25.223
Is it always so between
a man and a woman?

06:32.100 --> 06:35.104
It's often something like this.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.117
No,

06:45.196 --> 06:46.493
this isn't usual.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.165
It's different.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.471
Don't move.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.534
- Friend of yours?
- Aye.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.200
Hugh, Hugh Munro.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.869
Hi.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.124
How'd you know I was here?

07:44.214 --> 07:46.137
Aye, saw Dougal
and the others watering the horses?

07:46.216 --> 07:47.889
- Aye.
- Figured I must be up here.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.894
Her. Claire, my wife.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.278
Married but these two days.

08:08.113 --> 08:11.583
Says he's got news,
but insists we drink to you first.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.414
Canna say I disagree.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.561
Sure. Wedding gift.

08:33.638 --> 08:34.730
Oh, how kind.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.897
This is beautiful.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.777
It's a dragonfly.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.117
Thank you.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.576
Welcome.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.284
Gone official, have you?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.624
Or are these just for when
the game is scarce?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.417
What are they?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.496
Gaberlunzie tokens.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.544
They're licenses to beg, Sassenach.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.506
They're good within the borders
of a single parish.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.674
Single parish?

09:06.087 --> 09:07.555
About a dozen by my count.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.139
Aye, well, Munro's a special case,
you see.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.264
He was captured by the Turks at sea.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.474
Spent a good many years
as a slave in Algiers.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.439
That's where he lost his tongue.

09:22.604 --> 09:23.981
Cut it out?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.448
And poured boiling oil on his legs.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.792
It's how they forced
captive Christians to convert

09:35.867 --> 09:37.744
to Mussulman religion.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.176
Said you came wi' news.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.271
Who?

10:01.684 --> 10:02.810
Why would he know?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.153
Can he be trusted?

10:14.614 --> 10:15.661
What's his name?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.289
Ha... Harack.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.204
Harack?

10:23.081 --> 10:24.173
Horrock.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.878
Horrocks.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.050
When and where does this
Horrocks want to meet?

10:41.349 --> 10:42.475
All right.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.273
All right.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.660
Thank you, thank you kindly, Hugh.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.959
There's a chance
to get the price lifted from my head.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.795
There's a witness who
can prove my innocence.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.213
Claims he was there

11:12.422 --> 11:14.015
during my escape from Fort William,

11:14.716 --> 11:16.593
saw who actually killed the Sergeant.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.313
But I'm not sure I can trust him.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.891
- Is this Horrocks?
Ave,

11:24.100 --> 11:25.192
a Redcoat deserter.

11:27.145 --> 11:30.445
But if there's a chance
I can finally go home

11:31.649 --> 11:34.118
with my bride, Claire Fraser,

11:35.278 --> 11:36.530
Lady of Lallybroch...

11:54.756 --> 11:56.599
What about the Findhorn river?

11:57.091 --> 11:58.764
Did you tell them?

12:00.345 --> 12:02.564
They weren't interested.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.267
It's a theory, a good one.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.311
She leaves Craigh na Dun,

12:07.602 --> 12:09.730
gets lost, turns back,

12:09.812 --> 12:11.735
tries to follow the Findhorn river,

12:11.814 --> 12:14.613
takes a misstep, and then
is swept away by the current,

12:14.692 --> 12:16.069
all the way down
to the Darnaway Forest.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.076
Darnaway Forest is 20 miles
from where the car was found.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.999
Ah, the river is fast,
and it was swift that night.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.670
She could've been
carried twice that far.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.006
These maps of the area, they're poor.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.675
Looks as though
there are bends in the river here

12:30.750 --> 12:32.593
where she might have
made it to shore,

12:32.669 --> 12:34.512
and then found shelter
along this ridge, maybe,

12:34.587 --> 12:36.180
maybe in a cave.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.809
So she's tired, she's lost,
she doesn't know where to turn.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.512
So she hunkers down
in this cave to keep warm,

12:42.595 --> 12:44.939
and lives on fish and frogs

12:45.014 --> 12:46.140
while waiting to be found.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.352
Fish and frogs for seven weeks?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.277
She relied on her
army survival training.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.230
She's a strong woman.
She's smart. She's...

12:52.313 --> 12:53.405
We're grasping at straws.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.903
Gentlemen...

12:56.401 --> 12:58.495
- Tea is sewed.
- And biscuits.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.617
Thank you, Roger.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.540
May I have a biscuit, please?

13:03.199 --> 13:05.543
You mean another biscuit? Aye.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.712
Have you been eating
all my biscuits, Roger Wakefield?

13:09.163 --> 13:11.291
Now, go upstairs,
and get ready for bed.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.968
I'll be up in a minute
to read you a story.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.618
I think I need something
a little stronger.

13:42.864 --> 13:43.865
Care for some company?

13:43.948 --> 13:46.076
No, thank you. Don't wait up.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.433
What can I get you?

14:09.515 --> 14:10.767
Nothing.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.780
Evening, Mr. Randall.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.870
You can call me Sally,
but that's not my real name.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.121
What can I do for you, Sally?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.295
It's what I can do for you.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.395
I ken where he is.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.559
Where?

14:53.643 --> 14:54.815
Close.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.151
I'll take you to him.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.033
Not now.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.201
There's too many eyes
and ears in here.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.907
Meet me on Drummond Lane,

15:07.490 --> 15:09.959
just past the cobbler shop at 12:30.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.620
Come alone and bring the reward.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.920
Is he with her?

15:18.209 --> 15:19.461
My wife?

15:20.711 --> 15:21.803
I don't know.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.095
All I can do is take you
to where he is.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.642
After that, it's your concern.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.553
Remember, 12:30.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.488
Another.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.454
And some waterhorse
carries the builder

15:46.529 --> 15:48.748
straight into the water,

15:48.823 --> 15:50.791
and down through the depths

15:50.867 --> 15:53.586
to his own cold, fishy home,

15:54.537 --> 15:57.711
then he tells the builder
if he would be free,

15:58.416 --> 16:00.544
he must build a fine house,

16:01.252 --> 16:03.721
and a muckle chimney as well,

16:03.796 --> 16:06.766
so that the waterhorse's wife

16:06.841 --> 16:08.343
could warm her hands

16:08.426 --> 16:11.726
by the fire and fry her fish.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.895
And the builder, having
little choice, did as he was bid,

16:20.062 --> 16:22.531
because the waterhorse's
wife was sad,

16:22.607 --> 16:26.077
and cold, and hungry
in her new home beneath the waves.

16:30.615 --> 16:34.040
Be Yuletide by the time
we get back to Leoch.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.923
Christmas...

16:39.999 --> 16:42.548
I don't suppose
you hang stockings by the fire.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.928
To dry them off, you mean?

16:46.214 --> 16:47.261
Never mind.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.183
And the waterhorse's wife

16:51.427 --> 16:52.599
was warm then,

16:53.012 --> 16:57.142
and happy, and full of the fish
she fried for her supper,

16:57.767 --> 16:59.519
but when the man came down to the...

16:59.602 --> 17:00.694
What's the matter?

17:00.937 --> 17:02.905
The horses, they're restless.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.531
Someone's near.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.953
Now, don't move. We all know.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.121
Disappearing into
the murky waters below.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.416
And the waters
of the east end Loch Garve

17:19.038 --> 17:20.210
never freeze over,

17:20.748 --> 17:23.672
because the heat from
the waterhorse's chimney

17:23.751 --> 17:24.923
melts the ice.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.127
See that fallen tree?

17:27.421 --> 17:28.638
When I say, go to it

17:28.714 --> 17:29.806
and don't move.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.270
Take this.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.902
The waterhorse beneath the waves
has but fish's teeth

17:41.978 --> 17:45.232
and feeds on snails and water weeds

17:45.314 --> 17:47.282
and cold, wet things.

17:48.109 --> 17:51.033
His blood runs cold as water

17:51.320 --> 17:53.493
- and has no need of fire.
- Go!

17:53.864 --> 17:54.990
Mind the wagon!

18:13.634 --> 18:15.261
They're going
for the grain and the horses.

18:16.554 --> 18:17.601
Stay back.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.380
Come on, ye!

18:49.170 --> 18:50.387
Come on!

18:54.383 --> 18:55.600
Claire!

18:58.304 --> 18:59.305
Claire!

19:00.056 --> 19:01.899
I'm all right. I'm all right.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.569
Who were those men?

19:05.686 --> 19:06.903
The Grants.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.697
Did they take anything?

19:08.773 --> 19:10.116
A horse, three bags of grain,

19:10.191 --> 19:11.238
but none of the money.

19:11.359 --> 19:12.986
- A horse?
- Could've been worse.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.747
- Are you all right, Willie?
- Aye.

19:16.864 --> 19:20.368
Did you see that shot?
It was at 20 paces if it was one.

19:55.403 --> 19:58.873
Mr. Randall' I was starting to
think you weren't gonna show.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.450
I believe I'm on time.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.326
I just thought you might be early.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.305
Here.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.725
Where?

20:25.850 --> 20:27.318
Give us the reward.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.119
Stop!

20:45.369 --> 20:46.541
Stop, please!

20:50.040 --> 20:51.087
You're gonna kill him!

20:54.462 --> 20:55.839
No! No!

20:56.338 --> 20:57.385
No!

20:57.631 --> 20:59.304
No! No!

21:04.972 --> 21:06.349
There is no Highlander is there?

21:07.016 --> 21:08.188
Is there?

21:08.267 --> 21:09.985
No, no!

21:19.028 --> 21:20.826
<i>It's fashionable
in this modern age to dismiss</i>

21:20.905 --> 21:23.124
<i>the idea of good and evil,</i>

21:25.159 --> 21:26.331
<i>but there is evil,</i>

21:27.745 --> 21:30.214
<i>and it finds purchase in good men</i>

21:31.540 --> 21:34.214
<i>by giving sin the sweet
taste of ecstasy.</i>

21:36.504 --> 21:38.506
The Nazis drank
from that poisoned cup,

21:38.589 --> 21:40.466
thinking all the
while they were slaking their thirst

21:40.549 --> 21:41.675
with the sweetest wine.

21:41.759 --> 21:44.854
Are you suggesting that I have been
drinking from the same cup?

21:45.554 --> 21:47.352
Evil has but one cup.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.059
They drank long and deep.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.524
Yours was but a sip.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.402
Make it your last.

21:56.607 --> 21:59.030
Turn away from the darkness
that beckons you,

21:59.109 --> 22:00.611
and go back into the light.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.322
You mean leave Inverness.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.206
Aye.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.875
Go back to Oxford.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.172
You start your life over.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.011
And what of Claire?

22:18.087 --> 22:21.808
Let her go,
just as she has let you go.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.980
So you believe
that she left with the Highlander

22:32.059 --> 22:33.436
of her own volition?

22:37.815 --> 22:40.409
Have you ever read
Sherlock Holmes, Frank?

22:42.111 --> 22:43.704
Marvelous books.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.949
One point he makes,

22:47.533 --> 22:49.160
when you eliminate the impossible,

22:49.243 --> 22:51.621
whatever remains, however improbable,

22:52.162 --> 22:53.630
must be the truth.

23:09.805 --> 23:10.977
I don't know.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.228
It just slipped out of my hand.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.899
- Found it.
- Good man.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.871
It's too long and heavy for me.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.040
Lasses say that to me all the time.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.164
You gave her a knife and you didn't
show her how to use it.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.918
Someone should teach this lady
how to defend herself

23:34.997 --> 23:37.500
- against assailants.
- Aye, Angus,

23:37.958 --> 23:39.084
you're a good man with a blade.

23:40.044 --> 23:42.422
Thank you all the same,
but I think I'll be fine.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.756
Every man and woman
in the world needs to know

23:43.839 --> 23:45.341
how to defend themselves, Sassenach,

23:45.758 --> 23:47.510
especially those married to a Fraser.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.438
I become more aware
of that every day.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.106
Lass needs a Sgian Dubh.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.274
Aye.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.476
A what?

23:55.559 --> 23:57.653
Sgian Dubh, hidden dagger.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.605
Some people hide them in their socks,

23:59.688 --> 24:04.159
but I, I keep mine in
a rather more private place.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.739
Now then, who needs a lesson?

24:11.408 --> 24:13.581
Mostly, you want to
use the underhand.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.173
Overhand is only good
if you're coming down

24:17.247 --> 24:19.249
on someone else
with a considerable force

24:19.333 --> 24:21.131
from above ye.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.217
I still say the only
good weapon for a woman is poison.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.345
Perhaps, but it has
certain deficiencies in combat.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.184
All right.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.889
So where do I aim my Sgian Dubh?

24:33.263 --> 24:34.890
If you're killing face to face,

24:35.599 --> 24:36.725
here.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.395
Aim straight up, and then,

24:39.561 --> 24:41.029
as hard as you can into the heart.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.237
Avoid the breast bone.

24:45.401 --> 24:48.405
You get your knife
stuck in that soft part on the top,

24:49.029 --> 24:50.201
you'll be without a knife.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.622
So, right there?

24:55.202 --> 24:57.045
Whoa, dinnae kill him yet, Mistress.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.418
Wait 'til the lesson's over.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.252
Willie, give us a hand.

25:05.462 --> 25:08.136
Turn around, so I can show
how to kill from behind.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.182
Now, this

25:12.594 --> 25:14.096
is the spot in the back.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.848
Either side will do.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.604
Now, you see where
all the ribs and such?

25:17.683 --> 25:19.811
Very difficult

25:20.310 --> 25:21.482
to hit anything vital

25:21.562 --> 25:23.030
when you stab in the back.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.199
Slip the knife between the ribs.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.618
That's one thing.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.116
A lot harder to do
than ye might think.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.120
Here, here.

25:34.283 --> 25:35.785
Just under the last rib,

25:36.243 --> 25:39.747
you stab upward, and into the kidney.

25:41.790 --> 25:42.791
Straight up.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.342
They'll drop like a stone.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.552
All right.

25:49.757 --> 25:50.849
Straight up...

25:51.300 --> 25:52.472
And in.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.728
See, got it.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.424
Won't they come looking for us?

27:11.380 --> 27:12.597
I told Dougal

27:12.714 --> 27:14.011
we need to find some
more of your wee herbs.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.977
This is my idea, is it?

27:17.886 --> 27:19.433
And did he believe you?

27:20.305 --> 27:21.431
Never a chance.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.899
Does it ever stop, the wanting you?

27:53.255 --> 27:55.929
Now I know why the church
calls it a sacrament.

27:58.427 --> 27:59.474
Why?

28:01.638 --> 28:04.107
Because I feel like God
himself when I'm inside ye.

28:05.726 --> 28:06.818
What?

28:07.102 --> 28:09.025
Is that a foolish thing to say?

28:09.605 --> 28:11.232
You're laughing at me.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.446
Yes, I most certainly am.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.619
And you'll get what you deserve.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.799
Get up, you rutting bastard.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.299
You might ha' let
him finish first, Harry.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.261
Stoppin' in the middle,
now that's bad for a man's 'ealth.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.438
His 'ealth's no concern of mine.

28:43.305 --> 28:45.182
It won't be any concern
of his for much longer.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.109
Well, kill him,
and be done with it then,

28:47.976 --> 28:49.819
'cause I've a mind
to take a piece o' that.

28:55.359 --> 28:56.360
No...

28:57.653 --> 28:59.121
Think I'll let 'im watch first.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.907
You like that, you Scottish whoreson?

29:04.493 --> 29:06.166
Take a good look, laddie-buck,

29:06.745 --> 29:07.962
see how it's done,

29:08.038 --> 29:09.255
'cause I'll have your slut moaning

29:09.331 --> 29:10.958
for more before the hour is done.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.167
No!

30:12.311 --> 30:13.858
I have held my tongue for weeks now,

30:13.937 --> 30:15.484
and I'll be silent no longer.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.441
You cannot tell him
this fantasy of yours.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.819
I know what I know,
and I won't pretend that I don't.

30:19.901 --> 30:22.996
What you know is a bunch
of dribble-drabble and nonsense,

30:23.071 --> 30:25.165
and I will not have it
paraded about as fact.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.335
He has a right
to hear it and make up his own mind.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.788
You cannot hold up
false hope to the poor man,

30:30.912 --> 30:33.381
just as he's finally
accepting that his wife...

30:38.045 --> 30:39.388
It's an old house.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.558
Is there something you wish
to tell me, Mrs. Graham?

30:43.633 --> 30:44.930
There is.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.889
Even if it should
cost me my position,

30:47.971 --> 30:49.689
I feel I must tell you the truth.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.143
- The truth...
- The truth as I know it.

30:56.438 --> 30:57.690
There is another explanation

30:57.773 --> 30:59.446
for what happened to your wife.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.488
The stories are old.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.829
Some say as old as
the stones themselves,

31:08.533 --> 31:11.503
passed down
from generation to generation

31:11.620 --> 31:13.213
through ballads and songs.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.216
I first heard them
from my grandmother,

31:16.291 --> 31:17.964
and she from hers.

31:19.461 --> 31:21.964
The songs tell stories
about people who...

31:23.423 --> 31:24.970
Travel through the stones.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.977
Travel through stone?

31:30.055 --> 31:31.648
I'm not sure I take your meaning.

31:33.475 --> 31:36.149
Not literally through
the stone itself.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.571
You see...

31:38.438 --> 31:41.112
The circle at
Craigh na Dun marks a...

31:41.817 --> 31:43.194
A place on the Earth

31:43.276 --> 31:45.620
where the powers of nature
come together.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.914
Superstition and Middle-Maddie.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.331
Go on.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.130
The stones gather the powers,

31:55.372 --> 31:59.422
and give it focus,
like a glass, ye ken?

32:00.502 --> 32:04.507
And for certain people,
on certain days,

32:06.508 --> 32:09.887
it allows them to pierce
the veil of time.

32:12.389 --> 32:14.608
Mr. Randall, you know your
wife went up that hill

32:14.683 --> 32:16.560
the day she vanished.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.862
I believe she didn't
come back down that hill,

32:19.062 --> 32:21.030
at least not in 1945.

32:22.357 --> 32:26.737
I believe that she traveled
to some other time.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.122
Where or,

32:38.206 --> 32:39.458
when would that be?

32:40.208 --> 32:41.710
I don't know.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.130
Every traveler is different.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.556
They must make their own journey

32:47.299 --> 32:48.972
on their own path,

32:49.551 --> 32:51.519
but the songs do say

32:51.595 --> 32:53.723
that the travelers often return.

32:57.267 --> 32:58.439
I see.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.828
I shall leave for Oxford
this afternoon.

33:11.907 --> 33:13.159
Did ye no hear me?

33:13.241 --> 33:15.118
- Mrs. Graham.
- They often return.

33:15.202 --> 33:16.419
I did hear you.

33:17.746 --> 33:20.044
I simply do not share your beliefs.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.210
Forgive me.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.444
Sorry.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.401
I'm so sorry.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.403
It's all right.

33:46.608 --> 33:47.951
We're all right.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.361
My fault.

33:50.487 --> 33:51.830
To bring you here
without taking proper heed,

33:51.905 --> 33:53.248
and to let you be...

33:55.450 --> 33:57.043
To not stop him.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.667
It's all right.

34:01.456 --> 34:05.461
And here, you're so cold.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.217
Your hands are like ice.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.303
Jamie!

34:15.344 --> 34:16.391
- It's shock.
- Are you all right?

34:16.471 --> 34:17.518
We heard a shot.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.146
I'm going into shock.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.485
- Jamie.
- Stay.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.074
I'm going into shock.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.402
It's all right.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.204
<i>My mind jumped
and danced from thought to thought,</i>

34:36.283 --> 34:38.456
<i>like a stone skipping across a pond.</i>

34:39.452 --> 34:42.672
<i>My parents, men I'd seen die,</i>

34:43.706 --> 34:45.880
<i>the smell of Uncle Lamb's cigarettes,</i>

34:46.710 --> 34:48.678
<i>Error Flynn swinging on a rope,</i>

34:50.170 --> 34:53.344
<i>the feeling of my dagger lip
puncturing the kidney.</i>

34:58.013 --> 34:59.856
<i>I knew he was worried about me,</i>

35:01.558 --> 35:04.687
<i>knew he wanted to talk
about what had happened,</i>

35:06.563 --> 35:08.065
<i>but I knew if I did,</i>

35:08.148 --> 35:11.277
<i>if I started giving rein
to my feelings,</i>

35:11.359 --> 35:12.827
<i>things would pour out of me</i>

35:12.902 --> 35:15.246
<i>that I wanted to keep
locked away forever.</i>

35:15.322 --> 35:16.539
It's shock.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.459
It's all right.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.244
It's all right.

35:23.663 --> 35:24.960
Deserters.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.634
The tracks lead back
over the ridge, no horses.

35:28.418 --> 35:29.544
Good.

35:30.545 --> 35:31.717
Your man Horrocks...

35:32.213 --> 35:34.386
Munro said he's a deserter
like these.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.720
Hey, Hugh Munro's a good man.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.054
I won't deny it,

35:39.137 --> 35:40.980
but this is what becomes of a man

35:41.056 --> 35:43.479
who breaks his oath
to king and country.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.060
Now, you go and see Horrocks alone,

35:45.268 --> 35:47.817
you'll be walking
into a trap, maist like.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.022
He's right, Jamie.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.658
You have to meet him,
I understand that,

35:51.733 --> 35:54.703
but I say we all go with you
with our swords in our hands.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.246
Otherwise, you don't go at all.

35:57.364 --> 35:58.991
- Aye.
- Come on.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.691
<i>I don't remember getting on my horse.</i>

36:24.766 --> 36:26.359
<i>I don't remember riding away,</i>

36:26.434 --> 36:28.436
or even how long we rode.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.399
<i>All I can recall of that
pivotal moment in my life</i>

36:33.274 --> 36:36.278
<i>was that I was angry,
and I didn't know why.</i>

36:41.282 --> 36:42.408
Why are we stopping?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.000
You'll have to stay here with Willie.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.130
What?

36:48.540 --> 36:49.666
Dougal was right.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.795
Now, this man Horrocks
may be setting a trap.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.430
I'll no risk you again.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.595
You'll be safer here with
Willie to look out for ye.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.639
I don't need an explanation.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.058
You can take Willie with you.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.310
I can look after myself.
I think I've proven that earlier.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.145
You needn't prove it again.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.114
If there are Redcoats about,

37:16.651 --> 37:18.073
they'll likely come from the south.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.700
- I'll keep an eye out.
- Aye.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.457
You stay here.

37:22.532 --> 37:23.704
I'll be back, I promise.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.751
You shouldn't make
promises you can't keep.

37:25.827 --> 37:27.329
This one I will keep, Claire.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.998
Now, you promise me you'll stay put.

37:30.123 --> 37:31.670
- Jamie.
- Coming!

37:32.125 --> 37:33.422
Promise me, Claire.

37:33.501 --> 37:34.844
Swear you'll be here when I get back.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.051
Fine, I promise.

37:38.506 --> 37:39.598
Good.

37:41.676 --> 37:42.973
<i>In that moment,</i>

37:43.052 --> 37:45.521
<i>the reason for my bitterness
became clear to me.</i>

37:47.599 --> 37:51.229
<i>I wasn't angry at Jamie
or the Redcoat deserters.</i>

37:52.395 --> 37:54.272
<i>I was angry at myself</i>

37:54.355 --> 37:55.698
<i>for forgetting about my plan</i>

37:55.774 --> 37:58.493
<i>to make my way back
to the stones at Craigh na Dun,</i>

37:58.568 --> 38:01.287
<i>my plan to return to my own time,</i>

38:01.362 --> 38:03.456
<i>to my husband, Frank.</i>

38:03.531 --> 38:06.034
<i>US Army headquarters in
Berlin announced the death</i>

38:06.117 --> 38:08.961
<i>of General George S. Patton Jr,
earlier today</i>

38:09.037 --> 38:12.667
<i>from injuries he sustained
in a car accident 12 days ago.</i>

38:12.749 --> 38:15.218
<i>Patton's Cadillac model 75 staff car,</i>

38:15.293 --> 38:17.216
<i>transporting the general...</i>

38:19.172 --> 38:21.891
<i>As well as private first class
Horace L. Woodring</i>

38:21.966 --> 38:24.890
<i>collided with a truck
just outside of Speyer.</i>

38:30.225 --> 38:32.648
<i>A controversial figure,
General Patton's career</i>

38:32.727 --> 38:34.900
<i>spanned both
the First and Second World Wars,</i>

38:35.980 --> 38:38.403
<i>most recently as commander
of the US third army...</i>

39:13.059 --> 39:15.232
Mistress?

39:17.272 --> 39:18.273
Mistress!

39:19.816 --> 39:20.908
What?

39:20.984 --> 39:22.657
If you need me,
I'll just be taking care

39:22.735 --> 39:23.987
of some personal business.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.449
Go at least 50 yards away
and downwind.

39:27.740 --> 39:28.787
Aye.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.110
<i>I tried to avoid thinking
about the incident</i>

39:55.184 --> 39:56.561
<i>in the meadow,</i>

39:56.644 --> 39:58.863
<i>but my mind kept returning to it,</i>

39:58.938 --> 40:00.565
<i>again, and again,</i>

40:01.232 --> 40:04.406
<i>picking at a festering sore
best left untouched.</i>

40:19.459 --> 40:22.133
<i>And suddenly, there it was...</i>

40:23.671 --> 40:25.093
<i>Craigh na Dun.</i>

40:28.176 --> 40:30.804
<i>My mind had been
so clouded and confused,</i>

40:30.887 --> 40:33.481
<i>I didn't recognize
the road when we rode in.</i>

40:34.807 --> 40:36.855
<i>There was no mistaking it.</i>

40:37.977 --> 40:39.320
<i>I was back</i>

40:40.438 --> 40:42.941
<i>to the place where it had all begun.</i>

40:44.233 --> 40:47.328
<i>So much had happened.
So much had changed.</i>

40:48.363 --> 40:50.991
<i>Last I was here,
I was Claire Randall,</i>

40:51.407 --> 40:54.206
<i>then Claire Beauchamp,
then Claire Fraser.</i>

40:55.495 --> 40:58.669
<i>The question was,
who did I want to be?</i>

43:00.495 --> 43:01.712
Claire.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.425
Claire.

43:12.673 --> 43:13.970
Claire!

43:17.970 --> 43:20.564
Where are you, Claire?

43:22.600 --> 43:23.692
Frank!

43:25.311 --> 43:26.528
Claire!

43:27.647 --> 43:28.819
Frank,

43:29.649 --> 43:31.026
wait for me.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.494
Frank!

43:42.578 --> 43:43.795
Claire.

43:54.674 --> 43:55.926
Frank!

43:59.011 --> 44:00.058
No!

44:01.389 --> 44:02.561
Frank!

44:06.060 --> 44:07.232
Frank!

44:12.483 --> 44:13.700
Claire.

45:01.699 --> 45:04.452
<i>I knew where
we were going without having to ask,</i>

45:05.077 --> 45:06.545
<i>Fort William.</i>

45:06.621 --> 45:10.546
<i>The site of Jamie's incarceration
and flogging four years ago,</i>

45:10.625 --> 45:13.174
<i>and now, still the province of a man</i>

45:13.252 --> 45:16.131
<i>I unfortunately knew all too well.</i>

45:16.214 --> 45:19.388
<i>He would have
no advance notice of my capture.</i>

45:19.467 --> 45:22.016
<i>No time to plan his interrogation.</i>

45:22.887 --> 45:25.686
<i>I, on the other hand,
had the entire jolting journey</i>

45:25.765 --> 45:27.608
<i>in the back of the wagon to mink.</i>

45:28.059 --> 45:30.061
<i>It was my one advantage.</i>

45:30.311 --> 45:32.188
<i>I prayed it would be enough.</i>

45:33.481 --> 45:35.404
Felicitations and congratulations

45:35.483 --> 45:36.905
on your recent marriage.

45:38.819 --> 45:40.321
Though I don't particularly care

45:40.446 --> 45:43.199
whether you consider
yourself an Englishwoman or a Scot...

45:45.534 --> 45:47.457
And apparently, neither do you.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.464
You still wear your old wedding ring?

45:53.918 --> 45:55.340
Sentimental attachment.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.931
I doubt you have
a sentimental bone in your body.

46:03.177 --> 46:05.771
But the more interesting question is

46:06.013 --> 46:08.607
why would Dougal MacKenzie
consider you of such value,

46:09.225 --> 46:10.602
that he would rather adopt
you as one of his own

46:10.685 --> 46:12.528
than allow me to question you?

46:14.021 --> 46:17.275
I am sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

46:17.692 --> 46:18.909
Really?

46:21.112 --> 46:22.364
The King.

46:23.406 --> 46:24.749
The King.

46:29.161 --> 46:31.835
I'm glad to hear that you
still consider him your sovereign.

46:31.914 --> 46:34.292
We MacKenzies are all loyal subjects.

46:36.210 --> 46:37.928
That is the single most amusing thing

46:38.004 --> 46:39.130
I've heard all week.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.975
So I take it you haven't
been amusing yourself

46:43.050 --> 46:45.144
by flogging some
innocent prisoners then?

46:45.219 --> 46:46.721
Amusing myself?

46:48.055 --> 46:49.307
What an odd thing to say.

46:51.350 --> 46:53.853
As you know from
our previous meeting,

46:53.936 --> 46:57.110
I consider flogging a very
serious matter indeed.

47:24.050 --> 47:25.222
Madam,

47:27.053 --> 47:28.646
you need to understand your position.

47:29.430 --> 47:31.808
In this hour, our third encounter,

47:32.850 --> 47:36.354
I fully intend by any means necessary

47:36.729 --> 47:39.357
to discover both your true nature

47:39.440 --> 47:41.113
and the secrets that you hold.

47:46.072 --> 47:47.244
Perhaps you should ask

47:47.323 --> 47:48.449
the Duke of Sandringham.

47:53.412 --> 47:54.789
Oh, dear me,

47:55.498 --> 47:57.125
I do hope that won't stain.

48:05.466 --> 48:07.935
<i>A dangerous gambit to be sure,</i>

48:08.010 --> 48:10.138
<i>but his reaction
told me that Frank and the Reverend</i>

48:10.221 --> 48:11.939
<i>were right in their speculation.</i>

48:12.264 --> 48:15.359
I suspect your ancestor had a patron,

48:15.768 --> 48:18.271
a prominent and powerful man
who could protect him

48:18.354 --> 48:20.072
from the censure of his superiors.

48:20.147 --> 48:22.195
Possibly, but it would have to
have been someone

48:22.274 --> 48:24.026
very high up
in the hierarchy of the day

48:24.110 --> 48:25.578
to exert that kind of influence.

48:26.487 --> 48:27.704
The Duke of Sandringham?

48:28.823 --> 48:30.666
The Duke of Sandringham?

48:31.909 --> 48:34.207
<i>Black Jack was able
to commit his various crimes</i>

48:34.286 --> 48:36.584
<i>in the Highlands
because he was being protected</i>

48:36.664 --> 48:38.337
<i>by a powerful man,</i>

48:38.416 --> 48:40.168
<i>and the cost of such protection</i>

48:40.251 --> 48:42.674
<i>was always silence and fidelity.</i>

48:45.673 --> 48:46.799
What do you know of the Duke?

48:49.301 --> 48:53.181
Really, captain,
must you be so obtuse?

48:54.598 --> 48:56.316
Is it not clear by now

48:56.392 --> 48:58.110
that you and I are both in the employ

48:58.185 --> 49:00.187
of the same great and powerful man?

49:04.608 --> 49:07.031
That is impossible.
He would've told me.

49:10.197 --> 49:12.416
Because he tells you all his secrets?

49:14.368 --> 49:17.998
You must be a very
special officer indeed.

49:21.375 --> 49:24.128
I will simply send
a message to Sandringham asking him.

49:28.299 --> 49:29.676
Excellent idea.

49:31.177 --> 49:34.306
I'm sure he'll be most pleased
at your skill and acumen

49:34.388 --> 49:36.390
at uncovering my identity,

49:37.433 --> 49:38.559
or...

49:39.393 --> 49:40.861
Perhaps your disruption of the Duke's

49:40.936 --> 49:43.860
carefully laid plans
will not be rewarded.

49:44.648 --> 49:46.491
Perhaps he will be displeased,

49:46.567 --> 49:49.741
and take measures to terminate
your special relationship,

49:50.779 --> 49:53.373
withdraw the protection
to which you've become accustomed,

49:53.449 --> 49:54.701
and thus leave you at the mercy

49:54.783 --> 49:57.912
of your superior officers
and local authorities.

50:00.873 --> 50:02.546
No, the wisest course of action

50:03.501 --> 50:05.720
would be to allow me
to continue my mission

50:06.337 --> 50:08.590
and give the Duke
no indication of how close

50:08.672 --> 50:12.848
you came to disrupting
his efforts on behalf of the king.

50:27.233 --> 50:29.406
You mean, of course,
his wife's efforts.

50:31.820 --> 50:32.912
His wife?

50:32.988 --> 50:34.911
The Duchess. You've met her?

50:35.824 --> 50:37.792
- I've never had the pleasure.
- Really?

50:38.202 --> 50:41.752
An agent of the Duke
is an agent of the Duchess.

50:42.790 --> 50:44.963
Well, we have been in communication.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.044
Communication by letter?

50:47.336 --> 50:49.634
- By messenger, yes.
- With the Duchess?

50:49.713 --> 50:51.260
That's who we're talking about,
isn't it?

50:51.340 --> 50:52.341
Yes.

50:53.133 --> 50:54.225
That is...

50:55.970 --> 50:58.314
That is who we're talking about.

50:59.139 --> 51:00.982
But, of course...

51:03.143 --> 51:05.441
The Duke has never been married.

51:16.657 --> 51:17.954
Corporal.

51:19.201 --> 51:20.327
I'm sorry, madam.

51:30.796 --> 51:33.800
What kind of gentleman
keeps a rope at his desk?

51:34.425 --> 51:36.302
A prepared one, madam.

51:36.844 --> 51:37.970
You can go, Hawkins.

51:40.389 --> 51:41.857
And corporal,

51:43.892 --> 51:46.645
don't come back,
no matter what you hear.

51:46.895 --> 51:48.897
- Go.
- Sir.

52:04.538 --> 52:05.710
Help,

52:06.081 --> 52:07.298
somebody!

52:09.460 --> 52:10.712
Help me!

52:16.800 --> 52:17.972
Now...

52:22.431 --> 52:26.436
I think we should begin
with your name.

52:28.062 --> 52:29.359
Your real name.

52:29.521 --> 52:30.738
Then...

52:33.400 --> 52:35.744
You can tell me
everything that you know about...

52:38.072 --> 52:39.824
Dougal MacKenzie...

52:41.909 --> 52:43.411
His brother Colum...

52:45.704 --> 52:47.081
The...

52:48.248 --> 52:49.921
The Jacobite rebellion...

52:53.212 --> 52:54.589
And finally,

52:57.132 --> 52:58.509
the Duke of Sandringham.

53:01.345 --> 53:03.347
You are going to regret this.

53:05.516 --> 53:06.688
I doubt it.

53:27.162 --> 53:28.630
What have we here?

53:29.873 --> 53:31.250
My, my.

53:32.167 --> 53:33.919
The lady has claws.

53:34.545 --> 53:35.637
Are they sharp?

53:40.759 --> 53:42.477
Hmm, are they?

53:48.183 --> 53:51.187
I'll thank ye to take
your hands off my wife.

53:53.230 --> 53:54.482
Good God.
