00:30.232 --> 00:32.064
Please stand well clear
of the edge.

00:36.900 --> 00:37.980
All change.

01:05.025 --> 01:06.730
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:06.732 --> 01:09.188
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:09.190 --> 01:10.650
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:28.565 --> 03:30.355
You are in such shit, man.

03:30.357 --> 03:32.982
Dad.
You're in such shit, dad.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.398
By the way,
you stink of chlorine.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.148
And you stink of drugs.

03:39.150 --> 03:40.565
Do I, actually?

03:42.275 --> 03:43.563
No.

03:47.732 --> 03:49.775
Thank you very much.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.773
So is mum an MP now?

04:00.775 --> 04:02.605
She's a local councilor.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.688
Come on.

04:07.690 --> 04:10.648
- Who is that?
- It's her boss.

04:10.650 --> 04:14.105
- Dr. Joseph Goebbels.
- Hmm. A doctor. Cool.

04:14.107 --> 04:15.605
Wow!

04:15.607 --> 04:17.563
Whoa! Where are you going?

04:17.565 --> 04:19.730
What's the matter?
Are you scared of being alone?

04:23.650 --> 04:25.732
- Lovely do, isn't it?
- Thank you.

04:30.024 --> 04:34.188
- I have to see my wife.
- Oh, you're the numbers man.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.981
So, how long have you been
an accountant?

04:37.983 --> 04:40.356
Three hundred years.

04:40.358 --> 04:43.063
I always wanted to do something
like that myself

04:43.065 --> 04:44.648
but I just..

04:48.400 --> 04:51.190
I bet you're a whizz at Sudoku.

04:54.733 --> 04:56.731
Where were you?
I called you.

04:56.733 --> 04:59.813
- Oh, shit, did you?
- "Oh, shit, did you?"

04:59.815 --> 05:01.773
I know you think local politics
is pointless.

05:01.775 --> 05:05.438
- I didn't say that.
- Jesus, Eric, I got elected.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.357
Do you know
what that means to me?

05:08.733 --> 05:10.981
I just thought
it was your night.

05:10.983 --> 05:13.856
And you're my husband.

05:13.858 --> 05:15.813
And I really wanted you
to be here.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.688
To share it with me.

05:34.065 --> 05:35.898
- Morning.
- Morning.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.231
Morning.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.981
- Morning.
- Morning.

05:38.983 --> 05:40.023
Morning.

05:40.025 --> 05:41.773
- Morning.
- Morning.

05:48.275 --> 05:50.563
- Morning, Eric.
- Morning, Michael.

05:50.565 --> 05:51.813
How are the numbers?

05:51.815 --> 05:53.563
They fend off the chaos,
Michael.

05:53.565 --> 05:54.606
They fend off the chaos.

05:54.608 --> 05:56.938
Lovely stuff.

06:12.483 --> 06:14.188
- Hello.
- Oh, Eric.

06:14.190 --> 06:18.813
How does it feel to be a newly
elected council member?

06:18.815 --> 06:20.273
Fine.

06:20.275 --> 06:22.273
A tad nervous, I'll admit.

06:22.275 --> 06:23.565
It's a big meeting.

06:24.733 --> 06:26.231
You?

06:26.233 --> 06:27.816
How are you feeling?

06:29.190 --> 06:31.273
- Eric?
- Oh, I'm fine, yeah.

06:31.275 --> 06:33.898
So what's it like to have the
power to influence the lives...

06:33.900 --> 06:34.898
Why are you being weird?

06:34.900 --> 06:37.356
I'm not being weird,
I just wanted...

06:37.358 --> 06:38.606
To apologize, maybe?

06:38.608 --> 06:40.481
- What?
- I'd better go.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.106
You'd better go, had you?
Busy, are you?

06:42.108 --> 06:43.731
Why don't I call your assistant

06:43.733 --> 06:45.938
and see if she can pencil a date
in your diary?

06:45.940 --> 06:48.106
I... it's just that
I need to concentrate.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.023
- Look, I know what this is.
- Can we speak later?

06:50.025 --> 06:51.813
There's someone else,
isn't there?

06:51.815 --> 06:53.773
- What?
- You're seeing someone else.

06:53.775 --> 06:54.856
It's Lewis.

06:54.858 --> 06:56.231
Eric, please.

06:56.233 --> 06:58.648
He fancies you.
Anyone can see it.

06:58.650 --> 07:00.106
Tell me you don't fancy him.

07:00.108 --> 07:01.773
God, you're disappointing.

07:01.775 --> 07:04.648
- Disappointing?
- It's my first day, Eric.

07:04.650 --> 07:07.148
- Why can't you just...
- Leave? Hmm?

07:07.150 --> 07:09.773
- Morning!
- Oh, morning!

07:09.775 --> 07:11.148
- Who is that?
- Listen, can we..

07:11.150 --> 07:13.231
- Can we not do this right now?
- Is it the sex?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.688
- Jesus, Eric! I really can't..
- What is it?

07:15.690 --> 07:17.273
- Am I not satisfying you?
- Ugh!

07:17.275 --> 07:19.313
Because we used to have
great sex.

07:19.315 --> 07:20.856
- Seriously, Eric!
- Mind blowing.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.566
- Do you remember when we used to..
- Oh!

07:26.440 --> 07:29.773
Has your mum had that
new extension done, Stewart?

07:29.775 --> 07:31.231
Um..

07:31.233 --> 07:33.856
Heather?

07:33.858 --> 07:34.858
Heather?

08:16.815 --> 08:19.938
- For the love of Christ.
- Come on, guys, what is this?

08:19.940 --> 08:21.438
We can do better than this.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.148
Seven types of curly shite,
that's what that is.

08:24.150 --> 08:26.606
To paraphrase The Bard.

08:27.815 --> 08:28.938
Something funny?

08:28.940 --> 08:30.857
Yo, say it to my face, that.

08:33.025 --> 08:35.523
- Focus, Tom.
- Yeah, I am, on those...

08:35.525 --> 08:38.188
- Tom!
- Guys, let's try it again.

08:38.190 --> 08:39.732
Alright?

08:43.315 --> 08:44.565
Turn.

08:45.941 --> 08:48.858
- Flap your arms one more time.
- Oh. Stop.

08:50.232 --> 08:53.814
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
This is godawful.

08:53.816 --> 08:56.022
It's them lads.
I lost my flow.

08:56.024 --> 08:57.648
What flow?
There is no flow.

08:57.650 --> 08:58.939
Look, if you're
at the right angle

08:58.941 --> 09:00.605
I can't get around
to get me leg over.

09:00.607 --> 09:02.230
It's not your wife
you're talking to.

09:02.232 --> 09:03.980
The move, the move's
overcomplicated.

09:03.982 --> 09:05.980
- It's not that, Kurt.
- N... not just that, Luke.

09:05.982 --> 09:08.523
The fact that we're hopeless
isn't helping.

09:08.525 --> 09:10.355
- The fact it's all hopeless, in fact.
- Here we go.

09:10.357 --> 09:12.148
- Life is meaningless.
- Yours is.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.855
You just have to get used to it.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.355
It's... it's gonna have to get
into our muscle memory.

09:15.357 --> 09:16.855
No. It's a fitness issue.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.689
It's a practice issue.

09:18.691 --> 09:21.191
Actually, it's... it's a,
a numbers issue.

09:23.982 --> 09:26.773
If your aim is to rotate
as a single unit

09:26.775 --> 09:28.939
then you have to
have perfect symmetry

09:28.941 --> 09:31.648
and what's happening to you at the moment,
is you are collapsing in the middle

09:31.650 --> 09:34.273
because you don't have a pivot,
you don't have an apex variable.

09:34.275 --> 09:36.230
And an Audi convertible.

09:36.232 --> 09:38.314
What's... what's a, what's a..
What's an apex?

09:38.316 --> 09:41.273
A variable. It's a point around
which other points can move.

09:41.275 --> 09:44.814
The key thing is
you have to have even numbers.

09:44.816 --> 09:46.398
Always preferable
for fluid movement.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.439
What are you, a synchro swimmer
or on a spectrum?

09:49.441 --> 09:51.023
- Kurt, come on.
- Oh.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.773
I'm an accountant.

09:52.775 --> 09:54.939
It's just maths.
Most things are, ultimately.

09:54.941 --> 09:57.814
- Spectrum.
- Ignore... ignore him.

09:57.816 --> 10:00.564
Alright, j... just show us,
show us what you mean.

10:00.566 --> 10:02.855
Heather?

10:02.857 --> 10:04.775
What are you doing
on mum's phone?

10:07.732 --> 10:09.898
H... how bad?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.855
Billy? I... I'll come down.
Um, I have to go.

10:12.857 --> 10:14.355
Wait, wait, yeah.
Hold on a minute.

10:14.357 --> 10:16.189
- Excuse me.
- Hold up.

10:16.191 --> 10:19.314
If you want the move to work,
you'll have to lose a man.

10:32.482 --> 10:33.940
Is she okay?

10:39.066 --> 10:40.480
- Oh.
- Eric!

10:40.482 --> 10:41.857
I got here as quick as I could.

10:43.607 --> 10:46.855
He said you were sick. You were
drunk and lying on the floor.

10:46.857 --> 10:49.148
- What?
- Have you been sick?

10:49.150 --> 10:51.939
- No. No.
- You do look a bit pale.

10:51.941 --> 10:54.230
Alright.
I'm here now.

10:54.232 --> 10:55.775
Everything's gonna be okay.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.898
Here we are.
Use that.

11:06.857 --> 11:09.357
- Maybe I've been a bit..
- Hello, Eric.

11:15.025 --> 11:18.023
H... Heather and I were just discussing the
closure of a couple of local libraries.

11:18.025 --> 11:21.855
How much there is to do if we
were to work with these cuts.

11:21.857 --> 11:23.025
Eric!

11:29.441 --> 11:30.858
What are you doing?

11:33.191 --> 11:34.191
Eric?

11:53.566 --> 11:55.105
Announcement?

11:55.107 --> 11:58.148
I'm very pleased
that the two of you are saving

11:58.150 --> 12:00.064
the libraries,
the... the... the schools

12:00.066 --> 12:02.605
the, the whatever it is
that you superheroes do

12:02.607 --> 12:04.523
nowadays down
at the local council.

12:04.525 --> 12:06.230
- I should be going.
- No, no, no. Eric, calm down.

12:06.232 --> 12:09.607
Let me tell you this. You can do
it with your own bloody wine.

12:14.732 --> 12:16.982
Actually, I brought that one.

12:29.150 --> 12:31.025
Did you hit him?

12:33.066 --> 12:36.150
- Why not?
- Because there are other ways.

12:37.816 --> 12:41.898
- Like taking their wine?
- It is one of them, yes.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.230
He knows he can't mess with me,
Billy. He knows it.

12:49.650 --> 12:51.898
- Here you are, mate.
- What? Are you serious?

12:51.900 --> 12:53.732
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Hey, you're a star.

13:00.191 --> 13:02.398
How long will you be staying
with us, sir?

13:02.400 --> 13:04.398
One night.

13:17.857 --> 13:20.814
- What can I get you?
- A gin and tonic, please.

13:20.816 --> 13:22.025
Sure.

13:23.691 --> 13:25.025
Double.

13:27.150 --> 13:29.232
And follow that up
with another double.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.066
And then, after that
another one.

13:50.566 --> 13:52.564
Hey!

13:52.566 --> 13:54.148
Ever punched a man?

13:54.150 --> 13:55.650
Who hasn't?

14:12.525 --> 14:16.480
Heather? Heather, I know
you're in there.

14:16.482 --> 14:20.023
I'm making a complaint
about the buses.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.650
- They're shit.
- Oh.

14:28.482 --> 14:30.273
Come out!

14:30.275 --> 14:32.439
Goebbels!

14:32.441 --> 14:34.480
Come out of my house.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.150
Where are you?

14:37.107 --> 14:39.230
- Goebbels!
- Dad! What are you doing?

14:39.232 --> 14:40.605
Come out!

14:40.607 --> 14:41.773
Billy!

14:41.775 --> 14:44.273
Yay! It's dad.

14:44.275 --> 14:47.648
- Are you drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk.

14:47.650 --> 14:51.523
I.. It's bad for you
and it's expensive.

14:54.066 --> 14:56.439
Shh! There she is.

14:56.441 --> 14:59.564
Hey, where is he?
I'm gonna punch him.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.480
I'm not scared of him.
I'm not.

15:02.482 --> 15:06.273
You're scared of everything.
That's why you left.

15:06.275 --> 15:10.105
I did not leave.
You pushed me out of my house.

15:10.107 --> 15:11.690
Oh, please.

15:13.191 --> 15:15.105
What's happening with you, Eric?

15:15.107 --> 15:17.190
It's like you're not you
anymore.

15:18.441 --> 15:20.650
I don't even know
whether you still love me.

15:22.941 --> 15:23.941
Do you?

15:26.566 --> 15:28.150
Do you love me?

15:32.150 --> 15:34.232
Can you say you love me?

15:41.441 --> 15:42.900
Can you say anything?

15:48.025 --> 15:49.105
Bring him out.

15:49.107 --> 15:51.107
I'll show you what I can say.

17:04.316 --> 17:05.233
Eric!

17:07.941 --> 17:08.941
Eric.

17:12.316 --> 17:14.314
Let yourself be guided.

17:29.690 --> 17:31.563
- Were you..
- Shh.

17:42.815 --> 17:45.273
Don't fight it, Eric.

17:53.275 --> 17:54.900
Listen to the rhythm, Eric.

17:56.233 --> 17:57.691
And let yourself go.

19:13.483 --> 19:15.356
We've had a chat.

19:15.358 --> 19:17.773
- And we're all agreed.
- Agreed on what?

19:17.775 --> 19:20.231
It's not just any
Dickhead Dave off the street

19:20.233 --> 19:21.648
can join this club.

19:21.650 --> 19:23.523
- Right? There are rules.
- Who said anything about...

19:23.525 --> 19:26.648
You should know that this club
isn't just a club.

19:26.650 --> 19:28.648
- It's an idea.
- A protest.

19:28.650 --> 19:31.023
- A protest?
- Against the end of dreams.

19:31.025 --> 19:33.106
Against the meaninglessness
of life.

19:33.108 --> 19:35.688
Against who we've become.

19:35.690 --> 19:37.607
Against the rising price
of lager.

19:39.150 --> 19:42.775
We couldn't help noticing
a certain, um, kinship.

19:44.983 --> 19:45.981
Why would you think that?

19:45.983 --> 19:48.398
We, uh, saw you necking
the hard stuff.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.648
A young man in his 20s does
that, he's probably having fun.

19:50.650 --> 19:53.315
I mean, a man in his 40s
is in some trouble.

19:55.565 --> 19:57.648
Are we right?

19:57.650 --> 20:00.025
As it happens,
my wife and I are very happy.

20:03.025 --> 20:06.063
No one mentioned your wife.

20:06.065 --> 20:08.773
We've all had our moments
at the bottom of the pool, Eric.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.438
That's why we set this up.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.898
It's a place
to forget the world.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.898
To escape the callous judgments
and the petty rivalries.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.563
The pressure of home,
the disappointments, the..

20:18.565 --> 20:19.650
The tyranny of aging.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.813
- What?
- How old are you?

20:23.815 --> 20:26.856
This apex wotsit..

20:26.858 --> 20:29.525
You say we need an even number.

20:30.565 --> 20:32.565
But we needn't be one less.

20:43.690 --> 20:45.438
- We could be one more.
- Oh!

20:45.440 --> 20:46.938
That was implicit, Colin.

20:46.940 --> 20:48.688
- That's why he..
- Sort of ruined the moment.

20:48.690 --> 20:50.773
No, I didn't ruin the moment,
I... I was in the moment.

20:50.775 --> 20:52.731
- So, chaps..
- I felt the drama.

20:52.733 --> 20:55.773
- Training next Thursday?
- Eighteenth, right?

21:03.400 --> 21:05.483
- Morning, Eric.
- Morning.

21:11.108 --> 21:12.025
Right.

22:26.483 --> 22:27.606
- Ahh!
- Oh!

22:33.900 --> 22:34.983
Oy!

22:37.233 --> 22:40.648
I can't, I can't do this,
my legs keep sinking.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.773
Don't beat yourself up.

22:41.775 --> 22:44.023
The art of floating
remains a mystery.

22:44.025 --> 22:46.981
That eludes even
the seasoned pro.

22:46.983 --> 22:49.775
Though with the aid of
a merely one single finger..

22:53.358 --> 22:54.898
There we go.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.231
I'm floating.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.106
Oy!

22:59.108 --> 23:00.398
I'm glad you could join us.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.648
Sorry, but Brian is having
a meltdown.

23:02.650 --> 23:04.565
You're lucky I'm here at all.

23:10.150 --> 23:11.565
It's all in the legs, Eric.

23:12.733 --> 23:15.273
Don't. Look at me.

23:15.275 --> 23:17.563
Right foot over. Left foot over.

23:17.565 --> 23:19.857
Over, over. Over, over. Easy.

23:21.690 --> 23:25.438
Like a Ronaldo step over.
But in reverse.

23:25.440 --> 23:26.648
Why didn't you say so?

23:26.650 --> 23:29.023
Colin only deals with
football metaphors.

23:29.025 --> 23:31.688
Did you know he used to
play for Crystal Palace?

23:31.690 --> 23:32.607
Youth team.

23:34.608 --> 23:37.191
And keep your head erect,
and, above... above the..

23:38.440 --> 23:39.773
...surface of the water.

23:39.775 --> 23:42.148
You'll notice, Eric,
that the body position

23:42.150 --> 23:44.731
is vertical from
the head to the hips.

23:44.733 --> 23:47.731
Yeah. That is, of course,
unless your name is Ted.

23:47.733 --> 23:48.981
Shut it.

23:54.690 --> 23:58.023
Why can't you take this
seriously, huh? Bloody kids.

23:58.025 --> 23:59.813
What do you mean?
He splashed me first.

23:59.815 --> 24:01.898
Yeah. And I'll splash you again.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.813
Ah! Ha-ha-ha!

24:05.565 --> 24:06.731
Look, he's got it.

24:06.733 --> 24:08.731
The eggbeater. Have a look.

24:08.733 --> 24:09.608
Yeah, that's it.

24:16.565 --> 24:18.731
Eric, you're a natural.

24:59.900 --> 25:00.733
Rule one.

25:02.858 --> 25:04.731
"No one talks about swim club."

25:04.733 --> 25:08.773
What goes in the pool,
stays in the pool.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.898
Rule two?

25:10.900 --> 25:14.731
Rule two, "For one hour a week,
we swim together as a unit

25:14.733 --> 25:16.313
for each other."

25:16.315 --> 25:19.357
All reasonable endeavor should
be made to ensure attendance.

25:20.733 --> 25:24.773
Rule three,
"Your private life is that.

25:24.775 --> 25:26.188
Leave it at the door."

25:26.190 --> 25:28.690
No asking, no telling.

25:29.900 --> 25:31.898
Rule four.

25:31.900 --> 25:35.148
"The Club shall actively
promote the sport

25:35.150 --> 25:37.233
as a doping-free activity."

25:39.233 --> 25:40.438
What?

25:40.440 --> 25:41.775
Rule five..

25:44.400 --> 25:46.775
"We're as strong
as our weakest member."

25:47.858 --> 25:49.025
That is strong enough.

25:50.190 --> 25:51.856
I wondered where I fitted in.

25:57.483 --> 25:58.775
Any thoughts?

25:59.775 --> 26:01.438
- On?
- On Peechee.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.773
Any thoughts on Peechee?

26:02.775 --> 26:05.981
- Um, yes.
- Good.

26:05.983 --> 26:08.898
Why would anyone name
their company Peechee?

26:08.900 --> 26:10.731
It's not our concern.

26:10.733 --> 26:13.188
- Certainly had a good year.
- Uh, yes. Very.

26:13.190 --> 26:15.023
Which is why Cassius wants to

26:15.025 --> 26:16.981
you know, change things about
a bit, you know?

26:16.983 --> 26:19.398
- Tax wise.
- Cassius?

26:19.400 --> 26:21.106
- He's the boss.
- Of what?

26:21.108 --> 26:22.981
The Roman Senate?

26:22.983 --> 26:24.438
No, of Peechee.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.856
And Emperor Cassius wants to
move things around a bit

26:26.858 --> 26:28.106
does he?

26:28.108 --> 26:31.106
He just wants to,
you know, move his money.

26:31.108 --> 26:34.025
Reduce the liability. Okay?

26:36.690 --> 26:39.023
I see the missus is
causing trouble?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.150
Lovely stuff.

26:43.775 --> 26:47.438
...and all the feet
are touching in the middle.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.106
And, in theory

26:49.108 --> 26:52.563
that should allow the structure

26:52.565 --> 26:53.856
to rotate.

26:53.858 --> 26:55.525
Well, let's try it in the water.

27:04.440 --> 27:06.648
- Whoa!
- Whoo!

27:08.358 --> 27:09.938
Bravo, lads.
It's looking great.

27:09.940 --> 27:12.898
- Oh, you.
- Hi.

27:12.900 --> 27:13.900
Got any notes?

27:15.733 --> 27:17.856
Uh, yeah, okay.

27:17.858 --> 27:20.606
Um, at the beginning,
the alignment of the angles.

27:20.608 --> 27:21.688
That's out.

27:21.690 --> 27:23.438
And when you start that turn..

27:23.440 --> 27:24.563
Well, you got to be in sync.

27:24.565 --> 27:26.856
And I'm loving this
new formation.

27:26.858 --> 27:28.648
That's courtesy of our
new recruit.

27:28.650 --> 27:30.938
- Eric!
- Congratulations.

27:30.940 --> 27:33.438
Eric, meet Susan.
She's our resident mermaid.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.606
Hi.

27:34.608 --> 27:36.731
So, is that gonna be
part of the routine?

27:36.733 --> 27:38.023
'Cause they're really
going to love that.

27:38.025 --> 27:39.563
Yeah, I thought
we'd give it a go. Yeah?

27:39.565 --> 27:42.898
Excellent. It's really kind of
you to do this.

27:42.900 --> 27:44.106
Who's going to love what?

27:44.108 --> 27:46.563
No, we're doing this
thing, um, at a party.

27:46.565 --> 27:47.981
It's, um,
it's just a bit of fun.

27:47.983 --> 27:49.523
Yeah, performance
for Susan's family.

27:49.525 --> 27:51.023
It's... it's a birthday.

27:51.025 --> 27:53.981
Right, well,
I'll, uh, see you there. Bye.

27:53.983 --> 27:57.273
- See you.
- Bye-bye. See you.

27:57.275 --> 28:00.273
Hang on, hang on.
It's not a performance, right?

28:00.275 --> 28:03.063
We don't do performances.
We're doing this for ourselves.

28:03.065 --> 28:05.356
- Right. There.
- Does that include me?

28:05.358 --> 28:06.481
- Of course it does.
- Yeah, of course it does.

28:06.483 --> 28:07.606
- You're part of the team.
- Yeah.

28:07.608 --> 28:10.313
Of course, Eric,
you're integral, mate.

28:10.315 --> 28:12.313
Well, nobody said
anything about...

28:12.315 --> 28:14.938
Oh, I wouldn't worry.
Just basics.

28:14.940 --> 28:16.357
Right. Let's go, go, go.

28:21.565 --> 28:22.482
You good?

28:23.733 --> 28:24.733
Never better.

28:26.650 --> 28:29.273
How many will there be...
watching?

28:29.275 --> 28:30.565
Don't even think about it.

28:34.065 --> 28:36.273
Here comes the deck chair man.

28:36.275 --> 28:39.023
Oh, I'd bet it's bloody
freezing.

28:39.025 --> 28:41.481
What's up with you? Worried
about shrinkage, Teddy Bear?

28:41.483 --> 28:43.981
Or accidentally drowning you.

28:45.233 --> 28:48.063
Everything alright, Susan?
Are they, uh, are they here yet?

28:48.065 --> 28:49.313
Yeah. This is them.

28:49.315 --> 28:51.481
Lads, this is my brother, Alan.

28:51.483 --> 28:53.731
- Hi.
- Hello.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.481
- But they're men.
- Yeah.

28:56.483 --> 28:59.981
- Why are they men?
- It's a chromosome thing.

28:59.983 --> 29:02.231
I was expecting your
synchronized swimming team

29:02.233 --> 29:03.981
the... the women.

29:03.983 --> 29:05.731
Not the bloody wheat
intolerant village people.

29:05.733 --> 29:08.148
You got some front on ya,
Mr. Bloody Whippy.

29:08.150 --> 29:09.648
Alright. Easy.

29:09.650 --> 29:11.231
Let's just crack on, shall we?

29:11.233 --> 29:13.025
'Cause there's children waiting.

29:15.525 --> 29:16.648
Children?

29:24.025 --> 29:25.233
Quiet, everyone!

29:26.565 --> 29:29.313
Sarah!
Sarah, come here.

29:29.315 --> 29:30.481
Right.

29:30.483 --> 29:32.023
Sarah..

29:32.025 --> 29:34.898
...we have got a treat
for you.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.813
What is it, Aunt Suzy,
what is it?

29:36.815 --> 29:38.313
Please welcome

29:38.315 --> 29:42.523
a male synchronized
swimming team!

29:42.525 --> 29:44.188
- I thought you said..
- Tell me about it.

29:44.190 --> 29:46.398
Mickey's put on aftershave
and everything.

29:48.233 --> 29:49.566
Look, look, look, look.

29:52.065 --> 29:54.813
- Oh, Christ.
- Okay, focus.

29:54.815 --> 29:55.732
I am.

29:57.190 --> 29:58.107
On suicide.

30:00.775 --> 30:02.483
- Oh, Christ.
- You already said that.

30:40.483 --> 30:41.983
This is weird.

30:45.940 --> 30:47.690
He's... he's rubbish.

31:26.815 --> 31:28.148
Shit.

31:28.150 --> 31:30.231
Don't swear. They're just
surprised. That's all.

31:30.233 --> 31:33.648
- What's that, there?
- Oh! Shit! Over there!

31:35.315 --> 31:37.231
There's a poo in the pool.

31:37.233 --> 31:39.813
Get out, now!

31:39.815 --> 31:40.981
Pooh!

31:40.983 --> 31:42.773
Someone get it out!
It's disgusting.

31:50.565 --> 31:51.813
Quick, quick, quick!

31:55.815 --> 31:57.148
Did you see the size of it?

31:58.815 --> 32:02.188
It was all..
It was all party food.

32:02.190 --> 32:04.063
It just keep coming
straight at me

32:04.065 --> 32:05.606
like a little brown U-boat.

32:07.525 --> 32:09.188
Are you sure it wasn't you?

32:09.190 --> 32:10.148
"Oh, there's a poo in the pool!

32:10.150 --> 32:11.898
Oh! Somebody get it out!"

32:11.900 --> 32:14.773
Hey! What goes in the pool,
stays in the pool.

32:14.775 --> 32:17.188
The first rule of swimming club.

32:17.190 --> 32:20.313
Eric, you were really good.

32:20.315 --> 32:21.981
Really. Double apex.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.106
- Yay! Huh!
- I was okay.

32:24.108 --> 32:27.563
Ah, you were more than okay.
You all were. That was superb.

32:27.565 --> 32:29.813
It wasn't completely useless.
Can you unzip me?

32:29.815 --> 32:31.273
Given the circs.

32:33.358 --> 32:34.813
Bloody kids.

32:34.815 --> 32:37.356
- They don't understand art.
- They shit on our art.

32:40.108 --> 32:42.773
I thought the, um, tubs
were much better.

32:42.775 --> 32:45.025
- Oh, much.
- Good.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.938
Good. And I thought the...
the... the arm cadence was...

32:48.940 --> 32:50.231
- Yeah. Was sharper.
- Sharper.

32:50.233 --> 32:51.273
I could tell
you've been working.

32:51.275 --> 32:53.731
Hey, guys! Great work.

32:53.733 --> 32:55.563
You should be proud.

32:55.565 --> 32:57.813
- Is this guy taking the piss?
- Not at all.

32:57.815 --> 33:00.063
Maybe need to work teeny bit
on the technical stuff.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.938
But, it was so nice.

33:02.940 --> 33:04.731
Sorry, you are..
You are?

33:04.733 --> 33:07.356
Uh, Jonas Ljungberg.
I'm one of you.

33:07.358 --> 33:09.273
Oh.

33:09.275 --> 33:11.813
When you say you're one of us..

33:11.815 --> 33:14.148
I'm a synchro swimmer.

33:14.150 --> 33:16.688
- Oh. Right. That's a..
- We met on the circuit.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.981
Yeah, uh, Jonas is, um..

33:18.983 --> 33:21.438
He's part of the Swedish
National Team.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.981
Oh, I thought we were
the only ones.

33:22.983 --> 33:25.188
Are you joking?
There's many of us..

33:25.190 --> 33:27.688
Italians, Czechs,
uh, Japanese..

33:27.690 --> 33:29.648
- Americans.
- Americans.

33:29.650 --> 33:31.481
And now, English.

33:31.483 --> 33:33.273
You should join us in Milan,
next month.

33:33.275 --> 33:36.315
- Milan?
- At the World Championships.

33:38.315 --> 33:39.731
What?

33:39.733 --> 33:42.313
You see, I can't tell if this
guy is taking the piss or not.

33:42.315 --> 33:44.188
I'm totally serious.

33:44.190 --> 33:47.438
Room for all sorts.
Get practicing, guys.

33:47.440 --> 33:50.273
There's a five-way battle
for second place.

33:50.275 --> 33:51.606
See you in a bit.

33:51.608 --> 33:52.525
Oh..

33:54.315 --> 33:57.398
Who ever heard of
the World Men's Synchronized

33:57.400 --> 33:59.483
Swimming Championships, anyway?

34:01.275 --> 34:03.650
- It's ridiculous.
- Completely ridiculous.

34:05.190 --> 34:07.523
- Unofficial.
- What?

34:07.525 --> 34:09.313
The unofficial
World Championships.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.398
It's not recognized by the
authorities or anything. Jelly?

34:11.400 --> 34:12.275
Oh!

34:14.275 --> 34:16.313
Still ridiculous.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.190
The Men's Cup.

34:20.273 --> 34:23.190
No. Absolutely not.

34:24.773 --> 34:26.396
Here's a thing..

34:26.398 --> 34:29.563
I know his name is Silent Bob,
but I don't know..

34:29.565 --> 34:32.188
But I still don't know
what the other guy is called.

34:32.190 --> 34:33.896
- Oh.
- The New Guy.

34:33.898 --> 34:35.188
Is he new as well?

34:35.190 --> 34:38.481
No. He's been with us
for over a year now.

34:38.483 --> 34:40.396
- But I thought you said his...
- That's his name.

34:40.398 --> 34:42.396
The New Guy. That's all we know.

34:42.398 --> 34:44.813
Besides, we'll never be ready.

34:44.815 --> 34:47.356
Well, not if it starts
next month. No way.

34:47.358 --> 34:49.688
Well, you've got a whole month.
Ribena or squash?

34:49.690 --> 34:52.396
Anyway, Brian's got plans for
the both of us that weekend.

34:52.398 --> 34:54.231
You don't even know which
weekend it is.

34:54.233 --> 34:58.481
Uh, he has plans every weekend,
Luke. Every weekend, okay?

34:58.483 --> 35:00.814
I quite fancy Milan,
though, to be fair.

35:00.816 --> 35:02.106
My mate, Cockwomble

35:02.108 --> 35:05.314
he said there's wall to wall
birds out there.

35:05.316 --> 35:06.689
- Cockwomble?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:06.691 --> 35:08.314
He once had six women
at the same time.

35:08.316 --> 35:10.439
- I thought you and Brian were no longer...
- What do you mean?

35:10.441 --> 35:11.814
Well, it's none
of my business...

35:11.816 --> 35:13.356
No, it's none of your business.
Eat your jelly.

35:13.358 --> 35:16.523
Twenty-five years ago,
I played in a football match.

35:16.525 --> 35:18.483
It was the FA Youth Cup Final.

35:20.233 --> 35:22.148
Everyone was there.

35:22.150 --> 35:24.691
All the scouts from the biggest
clubs in England.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.733
This was the moment
I was going to make it.

35:30.441 --> 35:32.566
It was inevitable,
but then..

35:35.150 --> 35:36.439
Something went.

35:36.441 --> 35:38.816
- Hamstring?
- No. Something..

35:40.983 --> 35:42.483
Something in here.

35:44.441 --> 35:46.525
I couldn't move,
I couldn't think.

35:48.816 --> 35:50.400
Me old man couldn't even
look at me.

35:55.358 --> 35:56.275
I got the fear.

36:00.608 --> 36:02.191
I can't go there again.

36:21.191 --> 36:23.773
I just thought the, I thought
the meat raft was a little..

36:23.775 --> 36:25.398
- Honestly, it was really good.
- Ragged.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.398
Everybody thought it was good,
didn't they?

36:26.400 --> 36:27.606
- Yeah.
- Really?

36:27.608 --> 36:30.189
- See? Yeah.
- Oh.

36:30.191 --> 36:32.273
I'm really sorry about Jonas.

36:32.275 --> 36:34.273
- He doesn't mean to be rude.
- Why, why.. No, no. What are you saying?

36:34.275 --> 36:38.189
- He seems nice. He's..
- Oh, no, no, no. No, he's nice.

36:38.191 --> 36:39.856
He is nice, I... I like him.

36:39.858 --> 36:41.231
Yeah, I do.

36:41.233 --> 36:45.356
So, a... are you,
are you and him, do you.. Ahem.

36:45.358 --> 36:47.525
- Do you and him, do you..
- Oh, God.

36:49.525 --> 36:50.983
- Oh, God.
- Christ!

36:59.525 --> 37:01.731
Anyway, uh, look,
Cassius has been in touch again.

37:01.733 --> 37:05.566
And he's very keen as am I,
to get you involved.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.523
Off-shore.

37:08.525 --> 37:11.231
He's interested in getting
involved in that tax scheme

37:11.233 --> 37:12.356
you were talking about.

37:12.358 --> 37:14.523
The, um..
You know, the pop star one.

37:14.525 --> 37:18.023
Strictly speaking, it's not
a tax scheme, it's tax shelter.

37:18.025 --> 37:20.983
Must we be so pedantic?
It's legal.

37:24.691 --> 37:25.689
Hello.

37:25.691 --> 37:28.400
Eric, what do you think
about Milan?

37:29.733 --> 37:31.481
I thought you decided
against it.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.523
Yeah, I know, but..

37:33.525 --> 37:35.648
I don't know, there's something
about it that won't go away.

37:35.650 --> 37:38.439
- Or someone..
- What's that supposed to mean?

37:38.441 --> 37:41.106
- Ted?
- Look, Luke, you know my view.

37:41.108 --> 37:42.273
Yeah, but..

37:42.275 --> 37:45.189
Competition will destroy
the fabric of this club.

37:45.191 --> 37:47.689
It's completely against
the whole ethos.

37:47.691 --> 37:51.481
I agree. There's a purity to it,
an integrity.

37:51.483 --> 37:54.398
Besides, imagine all those
people just watching.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.564
Will you forget about
the bloody people, Colin?

37:57.566 --> 37:59.981
- It will be fine.
- Kurt?

37:59.983 --> 38:02.564
So, does that mean
you're in, Kurt?

38:02.566 --> 38:04.064
You want to do this, Luke.

38:04.066 --> 38:05.148
Why don't you just admit it?

38:07.858 --> 38:10.273
- Somebody running?
- Yeah, I'm well up for it.

38:10.275 --> 38:13.689
In fact, I could be at the
airport in about an hour.

38:13.691 --> 38:15.439
How many people people do you
think there will be?

38:15.441 --> 38:18.689
- Jesus, Col, come on.
- Just grow a pair, can't you?

38:18.691 --> 38:20.648
Maybe it's time for us
to evolve.

38:20.650 --> 38:23.273
I mean, what's the point of
a protest if nobody sees it?

38:23.275 --> 38:25.856
I mean, you know, we'll, we'll
be representing our country.

38:25.858 --> 38:27.731
God! A lot of people, then.

38:27.733 --> 38:30.106
Hey! We... we're going to play
for England. Wow!

38:30.108 --> 38:32.023
- Oy!
- And Wales.

38:32.025 --> 38:34.439
You... you're Britain.
It would have to be Britain.

38:34.441 --> 38:37.023
I mean, if we went,
which we're not.

38:37.025 --> 38:42.439
Actually, I've been, uh, working
on some music for the routine.

38:42.441 --> 38:44.814
Okay, so... so, you're up for
it, aren't you, Kurt?

38:44.816 --> 38:47.356
- Assuming you are.
- That's cool.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.525
- Interesting.
- Col?

38:50.650 --> 38:53.731
Come on, mate,
I'll do it if you do it.

38:53.733 --> 38:56.398
I mean, I could do
with an answer pretty quick.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.064
Oh, Christ!

38:58.066 --> 39:00.523
Okay. Ted?

39:00.525 --> 39:01.689
I'm against it.

39:01.691 --> 39:04.523
And I want that on record.

39:04.525 --> 39:05.564
But..

39:05.566 --> 39:06.606
Well..

39:06.608 --> 39:09.691
I'm not one to stand
in the way of democracy.

39:11.025 --> 39:15.773
- So, Eric..
- Yeah, Eric..

39:15.775 --> 39:17.731
- Um..
- No pressure.

39:17.733 --> 39:18.773
Back off, Kurt.

39:18.775 --> 39:20.773
To be clear..

39:20.775 --> 39:24.689
You're asking me to
contemplate a potentially

39:24.691 --> 39:26.731
thoroughly humiliating
experience.

39:26.733 --> 39:29.564
- He is.
- In a ridiculously short time frame.

39:29.566 --> 39:33.356
- Exactly.
- For which I am entirely ill-equipped.

39:33.358 --> 39:34.483
Bang on.

39:41.775 --> 39:43.356
Gentlemen,
I think you have your answer.

39:43.358 --> 39:45.648
- I'm in.
- What?

39:45.650 --> 39:48.064
- Excellent.
- Cheers for that, Eric.

39:48.066 --> 39:49.814
Nice one, partner.

39:49.816 --> 39:50.733
Get in.

39:51.816 --> 39:53.106
Get him.

39:53.108 --> 39:54.564
Got him.

39:54.566 --> 39:56.650
Ahh, did I mention they are
looking for a quick sale?

40:02.525 --> 40:03.608
Bollocks.

40:05.358 --> 40:06.856
- A coach.
- Yeah. Yeah.

40:06.858 --> 40:08.856
We need an outside eye.

40:08.858 --> 40:10.689
S... somebody who knows
what we can do.

40:10.691 --> 40:13.025
- And knows what we can't.
- Yeah.

40:19.816 --> 40:21.816
- You all want to do this?
- Yeah.

40:23.316 --> 40:27.439
Because you got to really,
really wanna do it.

40:27.441 --> 40:29.939
I'm talking four hours a day
minimum, six days a week

40:29.941 --> 40:31.106
for four weeks.

40:31.108 --> 40:33.148
- Ninety-six hours.
- Weirdo.

40:33.150 --> 40:34.689
It's gonna be tough.

40:34.691 --> 40:36.356
And, I'm warning you,
I take no prisoners.

40:36.358 --> 40:39.189
I am gonna be tough.

40:39.191 --> 40:41.775
You may well rue the day
you ever asked me to do this.

40:51.358 --> 40:53.981
Move it, you lazy bastards!

40:53.983 --> 40:56.148
Pain is weakness

40:56.150 --> 40:59.731
leaving the body!

40:59.733 --> 41:02.398
- I can't feel my legs.
- Good!

41:02.400 --> 41:04.564
Hang in there, mate.

41:04.566 --> 41:08.689
- My thighs are burning.
- Enjoy the burn.

41:08.691 --> 41:10.606
I'm loving the burn.

41:10.608 --> 41:11.606
Burn me!

41:12.900 --> 41:13.898
And..

41:13.900 --> 41:16.481
Rest!

41:17.566 --> 41:19.814
And, go.

41:25.608 --> 41:28.856
- Hey, good trainers, mate.
- Cheers, mate.

41:28.858 --> 41:31.773
Yeah. Breathable and flexible.

41:31.775 --> 41:34.064
I've got a contact at
Shoe Locker.

41:34.066 --> 41:35.981
Oh, you mean a thief?

41:35.983 --> 41:39.023
- I mean a contact.
- He steals stuff.

41:39.025 --> 41:41.773
Liberates them
and gives them to the poor.

41:41.775 --> 41:44.981
- Robin Hood in Reeboks.
- Twat.

41:44.983 --> 41:47.398
He's a bit of a live wire,
that Tom.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.148
I think I've got this.

41:49.150 --> 41:51.773
- Who are you calling a twat?
- You are a twat.

41:51.775 --> 41:55.273
- Says bloody Kurt the twat.
- You're a pair of twats.

41:55.275 --> 41:56.648
And you're not a twat,
I suppose?

41:56.650 --> 41:58.273
I may well be a twat

41:58.275 --> 42:00.023
but at least I'm not
the biggest twat.

42:01.858 --> 42:03.814
Yeah, you're just the oldest
twat, ain't it?

42:03.816 --> 42:06.148
- Twat.
- I think Eric's a twat.

42:06.150 --> 42:07.856
How am I even involved in this?

42:07.858 --> 42:09.856
- Ah!
- Ooh!

42:09.858 --> 42:10.856
Jesus!

42:10.858 --> 42:12.523
Tom!

42:21.566 --> 42:24.981
Okay, fellas.
We need a routine.

42:24.983 --> 42:26.856
Something
that says who we are.

42:26.858 --> 42:28.981
Well, who you are.

42:28.983 --> 42:31.939
So, who are you?

42:31.941 --> 42:35.773
- Aching, aging alcoholics.
- I'll say who we are.

42:35.775 --> 42:37.398
We're just a bunch of
middle-aged men

42:37.400 --> 42:39.064
who, for various reasons

42:39.066 --> 42:41.356
want to meet up in trunks
that are too small for us

42:41.358 --> 42:43.231
and make funny little
patterns in a pool.

42:43.233 --> 42:44.939
Excellent.

42:44.941 --> 42:47.148
- Is it?
- It is a start.

42:47.150 --> 42:48.898
I mean, I'll tell you what,
at least you guys

42:48.900 --> 42:50.314
don't have to
wear an inch of make-up

42:50.316 --> 42:52.856
and stick on a stupid smile
when you get in the pool.

42:52.858 --> 42:53.981
You can be who you wanna be.

42:53.983 --> 42:56.148
So who do you wanna be?

42:56.150 --> 42:59.189
Well, we're all, uh,
wilting flowers.

42:59.191 --> 43:01.439
- Oh, here we go.
- Well, we are.

43:01.441 --> 43:03.856
This is just a... a move
that we dabbled with.

43:03.858 --> 43:06.023
It captures something
of our dwindling powers

43:06.025 --> 43:08.064
but with a certain elegance.

43:08.066 --> 43:09.606
We should see that
in the pool then.

43:12.191 --> 43:15.233
- I'm sorry. That's me, I'm off.
- Getting grief from the missus?

43:16.650 --> 43:17.981
You know how it is.

43:17.983 --> 43:18.898
You can have my salad.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.564
- Goodbye, Ted.
- See you later, Teddy Bear.

43:20.566 --> 43:21.648
See you, Ted.

43:21.650 --> 43:24.814
Alright.
Come on then, what else?

43:24.816 --> 43:26.523
What makes you guys unique

43:26.525 --> 43:28.648
different from all
these other teams?

43:28.650 --> 43:32.189
♪ Oy oy oy ♪

43:32.191 --> 43:34.148
We're British.

43:34.150 --> 43:36.731
We're British and we're proud.

43:36.733 --> 43:39.148
- Oh! Really?
- Yeah.

43:39.150 --> 43:41.106
I mean, we had a great empire.

43:41.108 --> 43:43.023
I mean, we ruled
the freaking waves.

43:43.025 --> 43:44.233
Mm.

43:45.525 --> 43:46.650
Didn't we?

43:47.858 --> 43:49.898
Yes.

43:49.900 --> 43:52.648
Yes. This is giving me a... a
...an idea for the opening.

44:09.816 --> 44:12.023
I'm gonna represent
my country.

44:12.025 --> 44:13.898
What do you think?

44:13.900 --> 44:15.606
I think mum's right.

44:15.608 --> 44:17.314
You're losing it, dad.

44:17.316 --> 44:19.564
She thinks you need a therapist.

44:19.566 --> 44:20.731
Losing it?

44:20.733 --> 44:21.814
What do you mean, therapist?

44:21.816 --> 44:23.775
And now you're just
repeating words.

44:24.816 --> 44:27.106
She said you want a divorce.

44:27.108 --> 44:29.648
A divorce? Did she say that?

44:29.650 --> 44:30.858
You're doing it again.

44:32.525 --> 44:34.231
- Well, does she?
- I don't know.

44:34.233 --> 44:35.691
That's why I'm asking you.

44:38.525 --> 44:39.939
I know it's upsetting, right?

44:39.941 --> 44:42.398
And I know it's... it's...
it's a bit embarrassing.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.523
Spare me the "You care" crap.

44:44.525 --> 44:46.941
Hey, I do care.

44:48.441 --> 44:50.648
I really want you to
be proud of me.

44:50.650 --> 44:51.856
By what?

44:51.858 --> 44:52.983
Swimming with men?

45:12.025 --> 45:13.483
It's beautiful, isn't it?

45:14.983 --> 45:17.481
In a tragic sort of way.

45:17.483 --> 45:20.106
So, so that supposed to be us?

45:20.108 --> 45:21.689
Yeah.

45:21.691 --> 45:23.398
You're that little petal
on the left.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.356
- Oy!
- Alright, lads. Come on.

45:25.358 --> 45:26.900
Let's see what you can do.

45:29.108 --> 45:30.566
Now, heads in.

45:33.066 --> 45:34.150
And feet up.

45:36.441 --> 45:40.273
Eric, you are too tense. Relax.

45:40.275 --> 45:44.023
How do you relax? How do you
relax when you're drowning?

45:44.025 --> 45:45.773
Okay, let's try this..

45:45.775 --> 45:49.564
Five, six, seven, eight
and wilt.

45:58.066 --> 45:58.983
Oh, God!

46:05.025 --> 46:06.148
Jesus Christ,
what happened there?

46:06.150 --> 46:09.856
We're collapsing,
and we want wilting.

46:09.858 --> 46:12.189
Well, the end results
are the same.

46:12.191 --> 46:15.648
Wilting is dignified.
Collapsing is just pathetic.

46:15.650 --> 46:17.606
That's why the dying swan
is more popular

46:17.608 --> 46:20.648
then the sudden massive
fucking coronary swan.

46:20.650 --> 46:22.356
Ah, Jesus! Ah!

46:22.358 --> 46:24.648
- Come on, get it in. Get it in.
- Bloody hell!

46:24.650 --> 46:25.981
Ahhh!

46:25.983 --> 46:27.398
Okay, guys,
let's go try the net.

46:27.400 --> 46:28.689
Ahhh!

46:28.691 --> 46:30.023
Ohh!

46:30.025 --> 46:31.814
- That really hurts.
- Alright, alright, alright.

46:31.816 --> 46:33.023
Breathe through it.

46:33.025 --> 46:35.106
Breathe through it.

46:40.150 --> 46:41.689
I don't think
I'm cut out for this.

46:41.691 --> 46:43.231
Don't be a wet.

46:43.233 --> 46:45.856
If I pulled out now, they'd have
time to find somebody else.

46:45.858 --> 46:49.231
Tell me, is running away
a theme in your life?

46:49.233 --> 46:50.856
Stop wriggling,
you're bloody heavy.

46:50.858 --> 46:53.106
Hey, I shaved my bloody
legs for you.

46:53.108 --> 46:54.231
I'll shave your balls

46:54.233 --> 46:57.231
with a rusty knife
if you don't stop moving.

46:57.233 --> 46:59.106
If my wife could see me now.

46:59.108 --> 47:01.939
Yeah. She'd probably be
looking at me.

47:01.941 --> 47:04.189
- You wish.
- Poor old Ted.

47:06.316 --> 47:07.773
What?

47:07.775 --> 47:10.233
Must be years since she's seen
an arse as fit as this.

47:12.191 --> 47:13.108
Ah!

47:14.150 --> 47:15.775
Ted's wife, um..

47:16.900 --> 47:17.981
...she died.

47:17.983 --> 47:19.900
- Alright, come on.
- What?

47:21.191 --> 47:23.314
- A year ago.
- A year ago?

47:23.316 --> 47:25.066
Concentrate Teddy Bear,
come on.

47:26.566 --> 47:27.814
That's it, we're getting there.

47:27.816 --> 47:28.814
How long do we have to
hold this?

47:28.816 --> 47:30.564
Yes!

47:30.566 --> 47:32.941
It's the team you should be
proud to be a part of.

47:35.941 --> 47:37.148
Oh, come on!

47:37.150 --> 47:38.689
Is that the best you've got?

48:06.608 --> 48:10.273
Wow, guys. So what have we
learnt from that?

48:10.275 --> 48:13.773
Apart from the fact that we
can't do any of those things.

48:13.775 --> 48:15.316
Nor do we have the time to try.

48:18.441 --> 48:21.566
I can't even smile like that,
never mind do the legs.

48:23.608 --> 48:25.731
It's about getting into sync..

48:25.733 --> 48:29.314
...and feeling where your
partner is moving.

48:29.316 --> 48:31.856
Oh, I'm feeling you
right now, Ted.

48:31.858 --> 48:32.981
- Tom!
- Hey!

48:32.983 --> 48:37.273
- Hey!
- Shut it. Focus.

48:37.275 --> 48:40.273
And you've got to stop holding
these bellies in.

48:40.275 --> 48:42.648
If you've have them, use them.

48:43.941 --> 48:45.775
Move in close.

48:48.150 --> 48:50.273
Put your palms together..

48:50.275 --> 48:54.481
...and try to sense which way
your partner's going to move.

48:54.483 --> 48:55.858
Close your eyes.

49:01.816 --> 49:04.608
Okay, easy, tiger.

49:05.941 --> 49:07.400
Just take your time..

49:09.400 --> 49:11.356
...and breathe.

49:18.733 --> 49:21.275
Be in the moment.

49:23.733 --> 49:28.233
Now channel your energy
into your fingertips.

49:52.316 --> 49:54.814
Five, six, seven, eight,
and chaos!

49:55.983 --> 49:57.314
Come on! Give me chaos.

49:57.316 --> 50:00.398
I want rage.
I want middle-aged angst!

50:00.400 --> 50:03.314
Colin, you're pathetic!

50:03.316 --> 50:04.233
Rage!

50:06.400 --> 50:09.023
- And you heard about the demo?
- Yes.

50:09.025 --> 50:11.231
We should get behind them.

50:11.233 --> 50:14.314
- Maybe invite the local press?
- Make a bit of noise.

50:14.316 --> 50:16.439
Exactly.
Give the public a voice.

50:16.441 --> 50:17.441
I'll get on to it.

50:20.066 --> 50:22.314
- What?
- Oh, nothing. Uh..

50:22.316 --> 50:24.314
It's just..

50:24.316 --> 50:26.314
You... you are exactly
what this place needs.

50:27.775 --> 50:30.106
I'm not sure they'd all agree.

50:30.108 --> 50:33.106
- Oh, sorry.
- No, no. Go, go ahead.

50:35.358 --> 50:36.275
Michael?

50:37.316 --> 50:38.233
Yeah?

50:39.983 --> 50:40.900
Sorry?

50:43.191 --> 50:44.814
No.

50:44.816 --> 50:46.273
I don't know where he is.

50:46.275 --> 50:48.481
Five, six, seven, eight!
Give me more!

50:48.483 --> 50:50.189
And arms!

50:52.025 --> 50:54.939
And chaos!

50:54.941 --> 50:56.856
Thanks for letting me know.

50:56.858 --> 50:57.900
Okay, bye.

50:59.191 --> 51:00.191
Sorry.

51:01.941 --> 51:03.275
- All okay?
- Yeah, fine.

51:05.900 --> 51:08.773
I don't know what...
what's going on with him.

51:08.775 --> 51:10.356
He's been missing meetings

51:10.358 --> 51:12.398
behaving ridiculously.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.314
Don't tell me he's bought
a Harley Davidson.

51:14.316 --> 51:15.939
No, it's not like that.

51:15.941 --> 51:17.689
Sorry, I didn't mean, um..

51:18.691 --> 51:20.066
None of my business, obviously.

51:21.316 --> 51:22.691
If there's anything I can do..

51:24.025 --> 51:25.108
Thanks.

51:26.900 --> 51:28.400
It's like he's given up.

51:29.941 --> 51:31.150
Given into..

51:31.941 --> 51:33.314
God knows what.

51:33.316 --> 51:34.731
Chaos.

51:34.733 --> 51:37.398
It's the idea that finds
underlying order

51:37.400 --> 51:40.358
in seemingly random events
and data.

51:46.066 --> 51:49.939
The chaos theory.
My contribution to the team.

51:49.941 --> 51:51.316
Hi. I'm taking..

51:53.191 --> 51:55.898
Chaos is at the heart
of our routine.

51:55.900 --> 51:59.398
As man faces
the vicissitudes of time

51:59.400 --> 52:01.523
he searches in vain for meaning

52:01.525 --> 52:05.523
but he must learn not to fight
the chaos, but to embrace it.

52:05.525 --> 52:07.064
Bollocks, Ted.

52:07.066 --> 52:09.231
What, just because you can't
stick it on a tattoo?

52:09.233 --> 52:11.189
Hi. Hi. I've taken on
the challenge of

52:11.191 --> 52:12.648
composing the music
for the routine.

52:12.650 --> 52:15.356
As it goes, Luke and I were
in a band back in the day.

52:15.358 --> 52:17.106
- Yay!
- Yay!

52:17.108 --> 52:19.606
Now, I'm... I'm building
the themes, you know.

52:19.608 --> 52:22.273
I'm looking for something
intrinsically male

52:22.275 --> 52:24.775
something robust
and full-bodied.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.564
Where did get those cameras
from, Tom?

52:29.566 --> 52:31.439
Oy!

52:31.441 --> 52:32.981
Are these nicked?

52:32.983 --> 52:35.523
I just thought
I'd make a little documentary.

52:35.525 --> 52:37.858
- The road to Milan.
- Here we go.

52:38.775 --> 52:40.814
Unbelievable.

52:40.816 --> 52:41.981
Hey, Ted, how does it feel

52:41.983 --> 52:44.148
to have the body that
everybody wants?

52:44.150 --> 52:45.439

54:07.816 --> 54:09.689
And here we have Thomas

54:09.691 --> 54:13.441
attempting the flip
for the 43rd time.

54:18.691 --> 54:22.314
Gentlemen, I think we have
ourselves a finale.

54:29.191 --> 54:30.773
Look out, men.

54:30.775 --> 54:32.439
Intruder at 11 o'clock.

54:32.441 --> 54:33.689
Uh, if you.. Just..

54:33.691 --> 54:35.606
Yeah, give me a minute, fellas.

54:35.608 --> 54:37.858
Shades of espionage, methinks.

54:39.608 --> 54:41.606
They come over here

54:41.608 --> 54:43.523
they take our women.

54:43.525 --> 54:46.231
- Build our wardrobes.
- Don't be like that.

54:46.233 --> 54:49.523
Oh, but wait.

54:49.525 --> 54:52.314
The signs of rearguard action.

54:52.316 --> 54:53.398
It's not my fault.

54:53.400 --> 54:54.981
- And, yes!
- These things happen.

54:54.983 --> 54:57.023
The invader is repulsed.

54:57.025 --> 54:59.648
- Sayonara, sucker.
- See you, then.

54:59.650 --> 55:00.981
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

55:00.983 --> 55:02.066
See you.

55:09.066 --> 55:10.189
What?

55:11.650 --> 55:12.856
Stop it.

55:12.858 --> 55:15.314
One thing I would like to
put on record

55:15.316 --> 55:17.023
is how much
I'm loving being in a team.

55:17.025 --> 55:19.981
I was never into sports
and stuff at school

55:19.983 --> 55:21.773
but, for me,
to be able to stand here, naked

55:21.775 --> 55:22.773
with a few other guys..

55:22.775 --> 55:24.106
A little bit weird.

55:24.108 --> 55:25.981
I'd rather be in the shower
with my wife, to be fair.

55:25.983 --> 55:28.189
To be fair, I'd rather be in the
shower with your wife as well.

55:28.191 --> 55:29.606
Oy, Timmy.

55:29.608 --> 55:31.150
Yes, thank you, Tom.

56:27.400 --> 56:28.691
Have a nice day.

56:45.691 --> 56:47.356
When you say "indefinitely"

56:47.358 --> 56:50.023
perhaps you can be a little bit
more specific, sir.

56:50.025 --> 56:51.523
It is a busy time.

56:52.650 --> 56:55.356
Yes. It's a busy time
for me as well.

56:55.358 --> 56:56.856
Eric.

56:56.858 --> 56:58.106
Hello. How are...

56:58.108 --> 57:01.398
Have you seen the bank
statements?

57:01.400 --> 57:02.981
- Yes.
- Sleeprite?

57:02.983 --> 57:04.856
Don't you think
that's a bit extravagant?

57:06.691 --> 57:08.106
What's going on?

57:08.108 --> 57:09.481
We're in the middle of this.

57:09.483 --> 57:11.564
- Whatever this is.
- Well, that's..

57:11.566 --> 57:12.981
And you're missing meetings
at work

57:12.983 --> 57:14.814
and lark about at the pool
with a bunch of...

57:14.816 --> 57:15.816
You came to the pool?

57:18.358 --> 57:19.481
Billy was worried.

57:19.483 --> 57:20.648
Look, look. Number one.

57:20.650 --> 57:22.939
Uh, I have already rearranged

57:22.941 --> 57:25.439
the meeting with Michael, okay?

57:25.441 --> 57:26.564
That is done.

57:26.566 --> 57:29.148
Two, even as we speak

57:29.150 --> 57:31.608
I am checking out of the hotel.
Huh?

57:32.775 --> 57:34.064
I have friends, yeah?

57:42.483 --> 57:43.775
She came to the pool.

57:44.358 --> 57:45.691
Hey.

58:18.983 --> 58:21.900
Lift, lift, lift.

58:24.900 --> 58:26.856
- Nearly landed on my head.
- You're not focusing.

58:26.858 --> 58:29.023
Distribution in the stack
is wrong.

58:29.025 --> 58:30.856
For this to work
it has to be equal.

58:30.858 --> 58:32.689
Which means we have to take
height and weight

58:32.691 --> 58:33.650
into consideration.

58:34.691 --> 58:35.814
Meaning?

58:35.816 --> 58:37.064
Well, meaning you can't be
next to your man

58:37.066 --> 58:39.439
because he needs to be
next to someone less...

58:39.441 --> 58:40.358
Fat.

58:42.316 --> 58:43.858
You calling me fat?

58:44.775 --> 58:46.231
Archie, you calling me fat?

58:46.233 --> 58:48.189
Well, you could do
with losing a bit of brrrr.

58:48.191 --> 58:49.356
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

58:49.358 --> 58:50.939
Well, you could take
that back of yours

58:50.941 --> 58:51.939
to the barbers, mate.

58:51.941 --> 58:53.939
It's like trying to wrestle
with a yak.

58:53.941 --> 58:54.939
You're just jealous

58:54.941 --> 58:57.564
because you're wearing thin,
Fatboy Slim.

58:57.566 --> 59:01.189
As is your banter, mate,
hardened and lustrous, mate.

59:01.191 --> 59:03.564
Guys, guys,
let's do it again. Come on.

59:03.566 --> 59:05.689
Come on, we've got to practice
the throw.

59:05.691 --> 59:06.981
Can't do the throw
without the flyer

59:06.983 --> 59:08.731
and we haven't got the flyer
because we haven't got Tom.

59:08.733 --> 59:10.023
He's a bloody liability.

59:10.025 --> 59:11.773
Right, that's me.

59:11.775 --> 59:13.814
- Oh. Brilliant.
- Oh.

59:13.816 --> 59:16.856
Life's ticking away
and the clock's getting louder.

59:16.858 --> 59:18.481
- Come on, Colin.
- Sod off.

59:18.483 --> 59:20.316
Oh. Just having fun.
Tick, tock.

59:24.816 --> 59:25.898
Alright, chaps, some of you
still haven't

59:25.900 --> 59:28.023
coughed up for your flights.

59:28.025 --> 59:30.939
What about Tom?
Last day, tomorrow.

59:30.941 --> 59:33.898
- Yeah.
- He'll be here, okay?

59:33.900 --> 59:35.483
And if he's not..

59:36.691 --> 59:38.108
...it's got nothing to do
with me.

01:00:02.108 --> 01:00:06.106
Dad's a drunk
and his, his mum couldn't cope.

01:00:06.108 --> 01:00:10.023
And then he gets caught stealing
from Colin's site..

01:00:10.025 --> 01:00:13.773
Um... but rather than
turning him in

01:00:13.775 --> 01:00:15.648
Colin decides to give him
another chance

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:18.108
and he, he decides
to bring him to the pool.

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:20.900
Here we are.

01:00:24.941 --> 01:00:26.275
You live in a boat.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.148
I've never stayed in a boat.

01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:30.941
It's "on." On a boat.

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:33.566
Come through here.

01:00:34.608 --> 01:00:37.106
Wow, it's charming.

01:00:37.108 --> 01:00:39.148
It's been nothing but grief,
to tell you the truth.

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:40.981
My wife was right about that.
Would you like a beer?

01:00:40.983 --> 01:00:41.941
Yes, please.

01:00:47.941 --> 01:00:48.983
Sit down.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.023
Here you go.

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:55.441
Thank you.

01:00:57.316 --> 01:01:00.981
It's not the only thing
she was right about, turns out.

01:01:00.983 --> 01:01:04.106
She also said that the ballerina
that I left her for

01:01:04.108 --> 01:01:06.191
would eventually
get bored of me.

01:01:07.525 --> 01:01:09.106
And then, after she had taken me
to the cleaners

01:01:09.108 --> 01:01:10.981
that's my wife, that is

01:01:10.983 --> 01:01:15.356
I would only get weekend access
to my beautiful daughters.

01:01:15.358 --> 01:01:19.564
Who now see their father, frankly, as a...
as a as a bit of a loser.

01:01:19.566 --> 01:01:21.814
Yeah. You don't have to
tell me...

01:01:21.816 --> 01:01:23.983
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:01:25.525 --> 01:01:27.064
Bloody mess.

01:01:27.066 --> 01:01:29.231
You're the backbone of the team.

01:01:29.233 --> 01:01:33.106
You're the one who holds it all
together, r... really.

01:01:33.108 --> 01:01:37.106
And I'm not your
only admirer, am I?

01:01:37.108 --> 01:01:38.483
If you follow my drift.

01:01:39.858 --> 01:01:44.064
Oh! Ha-ha. Yeah, well, yeah.
Yeah. Hmm, maybe.

01:01:44.066 --> 01:01:46.273
If I was younger
or blonder or

01:01:46.275 --> 01:01:47.606
or... or more Swedish.

01:01:47.608 --> 01:01:49.483
- Swedish..
- Swedish, yeah.

01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:57.939
You still married?

01:01:59.608 --> 01:02:01.064
You... you don't have to..
It's..

01:02:01.066 --> 01:02:03.398
You know,
sometimes it helps to

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.858
get things off your chest.

01:02:12.525 --> 01:02:15.025
They are, uh, beautiful.

01:02:28.358 --> 01:02:32.023
Look, if he's not here by noon,
I suggest we just pack up.

01:02:32.025 --> 01:02:34.856
- Really?
- I'm as angry as everyone, okay?

01:02:34.858 --> 01:02:36.064
Right, when I give the nod

01:02:36.066 --> 01:02:37.106
we're gonna prep for the lift.

01:02:37.108 --> 01:02:37.981
To be honest with you,
I'm not sure

01:02:37.983 --> 01:02:39.856
if I can make it this weekend,
anyway.

01:02:39.858 --> 01:02:42.106
- What?
- Brian's got tickets to Amsterdam.

01:02:42.108 --> 01:02:43.981
I am nodding.

01:02:43.983 --> 01:02:46.608
Guys, concentrate.
Come on, I'm nodding.

01:02:54.025 --> 01:02:56.273
Nice.

01:02:56.275 --> 01:02:59.273
Good. Steady, steady.

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:01.106
And prepare for the throw.

01:03:01.108 --> 01:03:02.025
Oy.

01:03:02.608 --> 01:03:03.814
Tom!

01:03:03.816 --> 01:03:05.356
I thought this
was an all-men's team.

01:03:05.358 --> 01:03:06.689
Where the hell have you been?

01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:08.981
Nowhere.
Just.. Stuff came up.

01:03:08.983 --> 01:03:10.023
Look, kid.

01:03:10.025 --> 01:03:12.023
You need to take life more
seriously.

01:03:12.025 --> 01:03:13.814
Some things matter.

01:03:13.816 --> 01:03:16.148
Yeah, well, he's back now.
That's the point. Come on.

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:17.064
Come on. Get in.
I'll get you up to speed.

01:03:17.066 --> 01:03:18.148
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:20.150
What's that, on your ankle?

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.773
It's a tag.

01:03:23.775 --> 01:03:27.231
It's a bloody ankle tag, Tom.
I vouched for you.

01:03:27.233 --> 01:03:29.981
This is a disaster.
I bet he can't even travel.

01:03:29.983 --> 01:03:33.148
Amsterdam, here we come.
Yay!

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:35.106
You are bloody unbelievable.

01:03:35.108 --> 01:03:36.731
This is all so predictable.

01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:38.648
- It will be fine!
- How will it be fine...

01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:41.106
I'll handle this, Archie.

01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:44.064
This is not okay, Thomas.
Right?

01:03:44.066 --> 01:03:45.731
- Mate! What?
- You are bang out of order.

01:03:45.733 --> 01:03:46.981
You haven't actually got any
proof..

01:03:46.983 --> 01:03:48.189
- Come on, you two.
- You come here.

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:50.356
If there was a World
Championship for Chaos

01:03:50.358 --> 01:03:51.564
we'd bloody walk it.

01:03:51.566 --> 01:03:52.939
This whole thing was a mistake..

01:03:52.941 --> 01:03:55.106
- Can you all just calm down?
- Guys!

01:03:55.108 --> 01:03:56.731
That's training, then, is it?
Finished.

01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:58.481
...inside a meaningless
universe.

01:03:58.483 --> 01:03:59.648
Why do you always have to do
this?

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:03.064
Why do you have to be so
crapping negative?

01:04:03.066 --> 01:04:06.064
- It's endless moaning..
- Everybody out there always depended on you. Everyone.

01:04:06.066 --> 01:04:09.023
I'm telling it like it is,
and if you can't handle that...

01:04:09.025 --> 01:04:11.564
I'll tell you what you are.
You are a coward.

01:04:11.566 --> 01:04:13.856
- Stay there, stay there.
- Col, honestly, mate.

01:04:13.858 --> 01:04:17.064
I'll sort this.
I'll get to court before we go.

01:04:17.066 --> 01:04:18.148
- I'm telling you!
- Cool it.

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:19.398
You get out of my sight

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.606
or I'll be in there with you.

01:04:20.608 --> 01:04:22.273
The whole team
needs to take a time-out.

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:25.481
Team? This ain't a team.

01:04:25.483 --> 01:04:28.231
Oh, nice one, Col. That's very
constructive. Good one, mate.

01:04:28.233 --> 01:04:30.231
Or what? You want to start
something, Archie?

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:31.939
Hm? Yeah?
You want to bring it?

01:04:31.941 --> 01:04:33.773
- Cool it.
- Get off, Ted.

01:04:33.775 --> 01:04:36.398
- Do you want to take it outside?
- A good day, officers.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.814
How can we help you?

01:04:37.816 --> 01:04:39.733
We're looking
for Thomas Reynolds.

01:04:42.525 --> 01:04:45.523
We've not seen him today.
Um..

01:04:45.525 --> 01:04:47.356
- Has anyone seen Tom at all?
- No.

01:04:47.358 --> 01:04:48.981
No.

01:04:48.983 --> 01:04:52.025
Well, he should have been here,
that, uh, that scallywag.

01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:57.189
Any idea where he might be?

01:04:57.191 --> 01:05:00.773
Sometimes, on a Thursday,
he helps out with the old folk.

01:05:00.775 --> 01:05:02.689
And sometimes I play football
for Chelsea.

01:05:02.691 --> 01:05:05.314
I thought I recognized you.

01:05:05.316 --> 01:05:07.148
So what is it that you chaps
are doing here, then?

01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:08.648
Synchronized swimming.

01:05:08.650 --> 01:05:11.481
You're looking
at the British Men's Team.

01:05:13.191 --> 01:05:16.481
Men's synchronized swimming?
That's sounds a bit..

01:05:16.483 --> 01:05:17.441
Gay?

01:05:19.358 --> 01:05:21.775
Got a spare pair of shorts,
if you fancy it.

01:05:31.108 --> 01:05:33.439
Actually, we're rather busy this
afternoon. We have to press on.

01:05:33.441 --> 01:05:35.356
We've got the World Championship
at the weekend

01:05:35.358 --> 01:05:38.314
so, if you wouldn't mind..

01:05:41.608 --> 01:05:43.356
Might let him know
we're looking for him.

01:05:43.358 --> 01:05:45.148
Yeah,
and that he's broken curfew.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.023
Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

01:05:47.025 --> 01:05:48.398
Very serious, yeah.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.106
Thank you, officers.

01:05:50.108 --> 01:05:51.525
May the Force be with you.

01:05:59.275 --> 01:06:00.273
Tom! Come out.

01:06:00.275 --> 01:06:02.398
In court tomorrow morning,
right?

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.273
Yeah, exactly.
It's not a problem.

01:06:03.275 --> 01:06:05.189
'Cause we fly off
tomorrow afternoon.

01:06:05.191 --> 01:06:06.314
- Right?
- Yeah. Honestly, mate.

01:06:06.316 --> 01:06:07.523
They haven't actually got
anything on me.

01:06:07.525 --> 01:06:10.189
It's just this, it's this
formality that they do nowadays.

01:06:10.191 --> 01:06:11.233
Bloody idiot.

01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:17.398
Eric, look, um..

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.066
I'm sorry if I was a bit,
you know.

01:06:21.316 --> 01:06:22.650
When the blood's up..

01:06:23.858 --> 01:06:24.941
It's alright, really.

01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:27.523
Good man.

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.273
Why is everyone
calling me Archie?

01:06:30.483 --> 01:06:32.398
You know, as in Medes.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.564
What?

01:06:33.566 --> 01:06:34.483
Archie.

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:36.648
Archimedes.

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:38.064
Yeah.

01:06:38.066 --> 01:06:39.233
Quite like that.

01:06:41.233 --> 01:06:42.358
Goodnight, Silent Bob.

01:06:43.858 --> 01:06:44.981
You can't get a word in,
can you?

01:06:44.983 --> 01:06:47.064
Huh, listen..

01:06:47.066 --> 01:06:48.648
- Um..
- No, no. It's my fault.

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:50.023
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no.

01:06:50.025 --> 01:06:51.689
- I was way out of line.
- I started it.

01:06:51.691 --> 01:06:53.106
When I was ten, apparently.

01:06:53.108 --> 01:06:56.233
Look, I don't mean to be
down on things.

01:06:57.358 --> 01:06:59.566
If this group ever split up,
I'd be..

01:07:04.483 --> 01:07:06.275
- I'd be..
- Free on a Thursday night?

01:07:09.566 --> 01:07:12.023
Come here.

01:07:12.025 --> 01:07:14.981
Oh. When did things
get so tense between us?

01:07:14.983 --> 01:07:17.025
It's like having a wife again.

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:26.814
You've all got your suits,
yeah?

01:07:26.816 --> 01:07:27.775
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:07:28.733 --> 01:07:29.856
Alright,
just off for a quick..

01:07:29.858 --> 01:07:31.191
Yeah, we got it. We know.

01:07:31.733 --> 01:07:33.273
Curry.

01:07:33.275 --> 01:07:34.731
There's a new place
around the corner.

01:07:34.733 --> 01:07:36.066
Anyone's welcome.

01:07:36.983 --> 01:07:39.231
No, you're alright.

01:07:39.233 --> 01:07:42.398
Right, well, I will see you
all at the airport.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.314
- Ta-ta.
- See ya.

01:07:44.316 --> 01:07:45.773
Well, that's me off.

01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:47.648
- Are you off for a quick...
- Don't push it, son.

01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:49.939
Roger and out.
See you later, big man.

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:51.064
Come on, I'll give you a lift.

01:07:51.066 --> 01:07:52.523
- Oh, nice one.
- See you later, lads.

01:07:52.525 --> 01:07:54.025
- See ya, bye-bye.
- See you later.

01:07:55.066 --> 01:07:56.898
- Heathrow, Terminal 2.
- Yes.

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:57.900
You alright, Flora?

01:08:04.941 --> 01:08:07.148
Well, looks like
it's you and me, again.

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:08.523
All aboard.

01:08:08.525 --> 01:08:11.316
I find the sculling
at the end of the meat raft..

01:08:23.524 --> 01:08:24.566
Morning.

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:27.064
Ah. Uh, Eric.

01:08:27.066 --> 01:08:28.439
Um, I was just telling Cassius

01:08:28.441 --> 01:08:30.483
how you'll be looking after
his tax scheme.

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.814
- Peechee.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:08:33.816 --> 01:08:36.564
You won't believe what this man
can do with a balance sheet.

01:08:36.566 --> 01:08:40.229
He is a numerical wizard.
Huh?

01:08:40.232 --> 01:08:41.354
You know what, dude, I don't
care what you have to do

01:08:41.357 --> 01:08:43.104
as long as I can stop
hemorrhaging money

01:08:43.107 --> 01:08:44.604
to politicians.

01:08:44.607 --> 01:08:46.814
Do you know the difference
between tax avoidance

01:08:46.816 --> 01:08:47.979
and tax evasion?

01:08:47.982 --> 01:08:50.189
About a hundred grand?

01:08:50.191 --> 01:08:53.520
- I'd say about two years.
- What do you mean?

01:08:53.523 --> 01:08:56.357
You'd be committing fraud
on a huge scale.

01:08:58.566 --> 01:09:01.479
- Fraud?
- Well, that's not strictly, uh, true.

01:09:01.482 --> 01:09:03.354
You'd be hiding money
in illegal tax havens.

01:09:03.357 --> 01:09:05.395
Your business would
become police business.

01:09:05.398 --> 01:09:07.482
Um.. Excuse us.

01:09:10.482 --> 01:09:11.979
Are you insane?

01:09:11.982 --> 01:09:14.189
We cannot afford
to lose this account.

01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:15.564
Now, either you help me
do this, or..

01:09:15.566 --> 01:09:17.064
Or what?

01:09:17.066 --> 01:09:18.233
Or you fire me?

01:09:19.232 --> 01:09:20.270
You won't have to.

01:09:20.273 --> 01:09:22.354
'Cause you can tell the Emperor

01:09:22.357 --> 01:09:24.354
he can stick his tax evasion

01:09:24.357 --> 01:09:27.479
up his Peechee arse
and so can you.

01:09:27.482 --> 01:09:29.314
Because I..

01:09:29.316 --> 01:09:30.358
...quit.

01:09:37.898 --> 01:09:39.064
Breathe.

01:09:40.732 --> 01:09:42.107
In the moment, in the moment.

01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:47.439
- Hi.
- You quit your job.

01:09:47.441 --> 01:09:49.439
- Ah.
- Michael called.

01:09:49.441 --> 01:09:51.020
Yeah. I can explain.

01:09:51.023 --> 01:09:52.895
- Please, don't.
- I get to go to Milan.

01:09:52.898 --> 01:09:55.896
Ah, like the Blitz.
One bombshell after another.

01:09:55.898 --> 01:09:57.605
I've got tickets for you both

01:09:57.607 --> 01:10:00.939
for the Men's Synchronized
Swimming World Championships

01:10:00.941 --> 01:10:02.023
in Milan.

01:10:02.857 --> 01:10:04.398
Why do we want to see that?

01:10:05.566 --> 01:10:07.355
'Cause I'm in it.

01:10:07.357 --> 01:10:08.689
No, you're not.

01:10:08.691 --> 01:10:11.439
I am.
Even got my own nickname.

01:10:11.441 --> 01:10:13.148
The World Championship?

01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:15.523
It's a fledgling sport.
Didn't Billy say anything?

01:10:15.525 --> 01:10:17.064
No.

01:10:17.066 --> 01:10:18.564
Look, I gotta go
to the airport.

01:10:18.566 --> 01:10:19.941
We gotta get there a day early.

01:10:21.441 --> 01:10:22.523
Goes without saying

01:10:22.525 --> 01:10:25.605
that we'd love it if the both of
you could come.

01:10:25.607 --> 01:10:26.939
We need all the support
we can get.

01:10:26.941 --> 01:10:28.064
Arrivederci!

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.816
Sorry. Excuse me. Thank you.
Sorry.

01:10:39.275 --> 01:10:40.191
Excuse me.

01:10:42.525 --> 01:10:45.816
Sorry, sorry. I made it.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.480
Uh..

01:10:48.482 --> 01:10:49.564
What?

01:10:49.566 --> 01:10:51.900
- Still not answering.
- Tom.

01:10:53.732 --> 01:10:56.480
We're having
to rethink the lift.

01:10:56.482 --> 01:10:58.148
Maybe we can borrow somebody.
I don't know.

01:10:58.150 --> 01:10:59.107
Come on.

01:11:02.941 --> 01:11:04.483
- Aye, aye.
- Cheers, mate.

01:11:06.066 --> 01:11:09.358
See? I told you it'll be fine.
I'm an innocent man.

01:11:10.066 --> 01:11:11.230

And you got the local rag, yeah?

01:12:04.982 --> 01:12:06.814
And I am pushing for a couple
of the nationals,

01:12:06.816 --> 01:12:07.980
but I wouldn't hold your
breath.

01:12:07.982 --> 01:12:09.480
Well, surely we can
generate more..

01:12:09.482 --> 01:12:10.689
...synchronized swimming.

01:12:10.691 --> 01:12:13.523
Historically,
women have dominated the sport,

01:12:13.525 --> 01:12:16.689
but, tomorrow, in Milan,
it's men who will be competing

01:12:16.691 --> 01:12:19.689
for the unofficial
World Championship.

01:12:19.691 --> 01:12:22.189
And we all wish them
the very best of luck.

01:12:22.191 --> 01:12:23.730
Now, I expect it's going to be

01:12:23.732 --> 01:12:25.689
a little bit warmer in Milan
than it is here..

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:51.855
There's too many people.

01:12:51.857 --> 01:12:53.564
Four hundred and eighty

01:12:53.566 --> 01:12:57.314
if we assume ninety-six
into the available five rows.

01:12:57.316 --> 01:12:59.108
Yeah, thanks for that, Archie.

01:13:01.025 --> 01:13:02.607
Hey, I see the girls are in,
Lukey.

01:13:07.482 --> 01:13:09.814
Oh, look! There's Flora.

01:13:09.816 --> 01:13:11.105
Oh, Christ!

01:13:11.107 --> 01:13:13.148
Well, it's not too late
to cancel.

01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:14.773
Ohhh, I feel a bit sick.

01:13:19.691 --> 01:13:21.733
Don't let it intimidate you.
Come on.

01:13:28.982 --> 01:13:30.315
Are you okay?

01:13:32.650 --> 01:13:34.566
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:58.191
Right.

01:13:59.857 --> 01:14:01.605
This is it.

01:14:01.607 --> 01:14:04.855
And when you get out there,
I want you to hold your center.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:08.564
You make a mistake,
just move on.

01:14:08.566 --> 01:14:11.398
Ted, in that opening,
I want you to tuck your chin.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.775
We don't want you
losing your goggles.

01:14:14.025 --> 01:14:17.273
Honestly, you are looking
so solid.

01:14:17.275 --> 01:14:18.730
I think we should
go for this throw.

01:14:18.732 --> 01:14:20.523
No. I'm happy with the lift,
thanks.

01:14:20.525 --> 01:14:21.898
- Agreed.
- We're under rehearsed.

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.355
- Too risky.
- Yeah.

01:14:23.357 --> 01:14:25.023
Yeah.

01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:26.941
Okay. Absolutely.
It's your call.

01:14:29.691 --> 01:14:31.980
I just wanna say this.

01:14:31.982 --> 01:14:35.940
If you want it,
if you really want it..

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:39.733
You just gotta reach out
and take it.

01:14:43.775 --> 01:14:46.480
Right, I'm going to, uh,
bugger off

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:47.480
give you a moment
to yourselves.

01:14:47.482 --> 01:14:49.775
Remember, you can do this.

01:14:50.816 --> 01:14:52.400
I believe in you.

01:15:52.775 --> 01:15:54.773
Hey. Playing for England, yeah?

01:15:54.775 --> 01:15:56.605
- Yeah.
- Remember.

01:15:56.607 --> 01:15:58.400
Deep breaths, son.
Deep breaths.

01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:08.898
Can't do this.
No, I'm sorry.

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.355
No, I know,
I can't go out there.

01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:14.732
I can't go out there.
Oh, shit. Oh!

01:16:15.816 --> 01:16:18.023
I ran away from my wife.

01:16:18.025 --> 01:16:19.025
So?

01:16:21.482 --> 01:16:22.855
Convinced myself
that she threw me out

01:16:22.857 --> 01:16:24.148
but it's not what happened.

01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:25.689
Not now, Eric.
Colin's having a bit of a..

01:16:25.691 --> 01:16:26.814
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're sort of
in a zone here, mate.

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:28.273
No, wait, wait.
Let him speak.

01:16:28.275 --> 01:16:29.650
Go on, Eric. Go on.

01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:31.939
It was me.

01:16:31.941 --> 01:16:33.773
I was running away..

01:16:33.775 --> 01:16:35.980
...from her.

01:16:35.982 --> 01:16:37.482
Running away from my son.

01:16:38.607 --> 01:16:40.232
I was running away
from everything.

01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:45.398
I know now, it was fear..

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.025
...fear of getting older.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.732
Fear of failure.

01:16:52.732 --> 01:16:54.232
But you guys..

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.525
You showed me
how to stop running.

01:16:59.607 --> 01:17:02.730
This club,
with its silly moves..

01:17:02.732 --> 01:17:03.980
Hey!

01:17:03.982 --> 01:17:07.814
Slightly silly moves

01:17:07.816 --> 01:17:10.355
has taught me to appreciate
what I have in my life

01:17:10.357 --> 01:17:13.315
and not regret
what I don't have.

01:17:15.232 --> 01:17:17.064
And what do I have?

01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:52.523
So let's go out there
and do this for each other.

01:17:52.525 --> 01:17:56.023
And if it's not perfect,
at least we were here..

01:17:56.025 --> 01:17:58.857
...now... together.

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.025
If we come last..

01:18:05.941 --> 01:18:07.608
...I'll kill the lot of you.

I know it's gonna be us.

01:22:30.816 --> 01:22:33.230
It's not about the competition,
lads, we've all said that.

01:22:33.232 --> 01:22:35.980
Stati Uniti! USA.

01:22:35.982 --> 01:22:39.980
- Yes! Yes! We did it!
- Oh!

01:22:42.941 --> 01:22:45.066
Well done! Oh, no.

01:22:46.357 --> 01:22:47.275
Sorry.

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:52.898
In fifth place..

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:55.064
No shame in fifth.
No shame at all.

01:22:55.066 --> 01:22:56.605
Republica Ceca.

01:22:56.607 --> 01:22:58.315
- No way.
- Czech Republic.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.814
We're going to win a medal.

01:23:08.816 --> 01:23:11.314
We're in the medals.
We're in the medals.

01:23:11.316 --> 01:23:12.441
We've got bronze, guys.

01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:16.775
In third place..

01:23:18.441 --> 01:23:20.189
Italia. Italy!

01:23:20.191 --> 01:23:21.191

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.232
Oh!

01:23:26.232 --> 01:23:27.690

Mamma-soddin'-mia!

01:23:36.566 --> 01:23:37.650
We did it!

01:23:38.316 --> 01:23:39.939
Second place, eh!

01:23:39.941 --> 01:23:41.648
We got second place!

01:23:51.482 --> 01:23:52.314
Sweden!

01:23:58.107 --> 01:23:59.439
Well played.

01:23:59.441 --> 01:24:00.566
Well played.

01:24:08.732 --> 01:24:10.189
Ted!

01:24:10.191 --> 01:24:11.150
What's wrong?

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.898
We were robbed.
We were bloody robbed.

01:24:17.941 --> 01:24:19.814
- Get over here.
- Come on.

01:24:19.816 --> 01:24:21.023
This is great.

01:24:24.316 --> 01:24:25.398
I'm so proud of you.

01:24:59.357 --> 01:25:00.315
Susan?

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.189
Tell me..
Um, tell me something.

01:25:03.191 --> 01:25:06.773
Um, you said that we should just
be who we are, right?

01:25:06.775 --> 01:25:08.605
- Yeah.
- And you're the, you're the coach.

01:25:08.607 --> 01:25:10.275
So, um..

01:25:11.525 --> 01:25:13.566
Well..
Who do you think we are?

01:25:17.816 --> 01:25:22.941
The most broken, flawed,
beautiful..

01:25:25.525 --> 01:25:27.400
...bunch of twats
that I've ever met.

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:35.357
Shall we?

01:25:44.566 --> 01:25:46.316
Ah!

01:25:47.691 --> 01:25:49.441
Jesus Christ.

01:26:15.482 --> 01:26:17.775
Go back home and get her, son.

01:26:19.316 --> 01:26:20.480
Take it from me.

01:26:20.482 --> 01:26:22.105
There's plenty of time
to miss her

01:26:22.107 --> 01:26:23.357
when she's gone.

01:26:24.107 --> 01:26:25.482
Falling in love..

01:26:33.566 --> 01:26:36.525
It's like having a stroke
or a car accident.

01:26:38.441 --> 01:26:39.858
Thanks for that..

01:26:40.482 --> 01:26:41.525
...Bob.

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:47.482
Tell me, have you ever heard
of the Japanese puffer fish?

01:26:48.982 --> 01:26:51.148
Save our libraries!

01:26:51.150 --> 01:26:52.525
Books, not bombs.

01:26:53.650 --> 01:26:54.480
Save our libraries!

01:26:54.482 --> 01:26:55.439
Well..

01:26:55.441 --> 01:26:57.148
I'm sure you'll all agree

01:26:57.150 --> 01:26:58.939
that Heather has done
an incredible job on this.

01:26:58.941 --> 01:27:00.773
I have to say, I'm hugely
disappointed

01:27:00.775 --> 01:27:04.605
in the attitude of the press.
All but total indifference.

01:27:04.607 --> 01:27:06.523
I mean, just a little coverage
could have changed the game.

01:27:06.525 --> 01:27:07.357

01:30:01.275 --> 01:30:02.689
My mate Joe's dad came out

01:30:02.691 --> 01:30:04.898
and it was, like, totally fine.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.648

shit off people anymore.

You're my dad.

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:40.980
