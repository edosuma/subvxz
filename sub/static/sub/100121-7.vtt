- You really think

00:03.095 --> 00:05.030
an energy weapon's gonna
stop this Monitor guy?

00:05.055 --> 00:07.928

00:07.953 --> 00:09.247
You're working with the Monitor.

Mar Novu is trying to save
worlds, not destroy them.

01:16.374 --> 01:18.079
CONNOR: A bunch of guys in tac gear came

us to build a weapon,

and it has to be done on this island.

anything for that guy.

01:32.794 --> 01:34.393
John, we have to.

01:38.522 --> 01:40.482
JOHN: Since when do we
take orders from the enemy?

01:40.506 --> 01:42.801
We were wrong about Novu, John.

01:42.826 --> 01:43.891
He's not our enemy.

01:43.916 --> 01:45.028
Since when?

01:45.053 --> 01:47.361
He dropped me in an alternate reality

01:47.386 --> 01:48.826
in order to teach me the lesson that

01:48.850 --> 01:50.699
to fix the multiverse,

01:50.724 --> 01:52.723
we need to work with him.

This is crazy.

OLIVER: John...

02:03.447 --> 02:04.842
How do we build the weapon?

02:04.867 --> 02:06.387
The materials we need are already here

02:06.411 --> 02:07.748
in the crates outside.

02:07.773 --> 02:09.406
Dr. Wong has been experimenting

02:09.431 --> 02:11.585
with the dwarf star particles
since leaving Hong Kong.

02:11.610 --> 02:13.359
He's designed schematics for the build.

02:13.384 --> 02:15.551
WILLIAM: Schematics? Why
does that make me think

02:15.576 --> 02:17.825
that this Dr. Wong guy won't
actually build this thing?

02:17.850 --> 02:19.149
We're counting on you for that.

02:19.174 --> 02:22.074
- Say again?
- The device is powered by plutonium.

Dinah, Roy, and Rene
are on their way here

02:24.181 --> 02:25.378
with samples from Star City.

02:25.403 --> 02:26.643
So my mission was part of this?

02:26.668 --> 02:28.900
All of our missions are a part of this.

02:31.730 --> 02:33.556
With all due respect,

02:34.133 --> 02:36.988
what am I doing back on Lian Yu?

02:37.013 --> 02:39.729
In the past few days,
the island has seen

02:39.754 --> 02:41.061
a rash of energy spikes.

02:41.086 --> 02:43.302
Is that your reason for it being green?

02:43.327 --> 02:45.185
Because the last time that I was here,

02:45.210 --> 02:47.059
Adrian chase blew it up.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.166
Yes. Harnessing that energy is the key,

02:49.191 --> 02:50.751
and we need to do it right away because

02:50.775 --> 02:53.180
we have no idea how long
the energy spikes will last.

02:53.205 --> 02:54.571
Okay, wait. So we...

02:54.596 --> 02:56.722
build this magic weapon
for the space god

02:56.747 --> 02:58.500
and we stop Crisis?

02:58.525 --> 03:00.267
There is no stopping Crisis.

03:00.292 --> 03:01.705
Well, then what's the weapon for?

03:01.730 --> 03:03.063
I don't know,

03:03.730 --> 03:06.390
but Novu said this is how we survive it,

03:06.415 --> 03:07.608
and I believe him.

03:07.633 --> 03:09.566
If we can't stop Crisis...

03:14.417 --> 03:15.836
Sorry.

03:15.861 --> 03:17.912
What is he talking about?

03:18.975 --> 03:20.854
Oh, my God.

03:20.879 --> 03:24.424
Would the group mind if I
had a moment with my kids?

03:24.634 --> 03:26.334
Of course.

03:34.887 --> 03:37.285
There's no easy way to say this.

03:38.564 --> 03:41.096

- What do you mean?
- I mean that he told me

03:46.456 --> 03:49.183
what would happen to me
the day that he walked in

03:49.208 --> 03:50.540
and asked for my help.

03:50.565 --> 03:53.146
And when exactly were you
planning on telling us?

03:54.385 --> 03:57.355
I've been fighting my fate
because of the two of you,

03:57.380 --> 04:00.257

04:06.736 --> 04:10.771
and I'm trying to keep
the two of you safe.

04:10.796 --> 04:12.435
We're gonna build the weapon,

04:12.460 --> 04:14.164
we're gonna finish this mission,

04:14.509 --> 04:17.575
and that's the way that it has to be.

I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.386
So you thought tranqing
me and bringing me here

04:39.411 --> 04:41.632
of all places was somehow
a better explanation.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.738
Mar Novu made it clear that silence was

04:43.763 --> 04:45.506
a requirement of the mission.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.074
We couldn't risk interfering

04:47.099 --> 04:48.659
with the journeys of the other players.

04:48.683 --> 04:51.950

ending in a death sentence?

04:52.509 --> 04:54.287
What did Novu ask you to do, Lyla?

04:54.312 --> 04:56.156
He didn't give me details.

04:56.974 --> 04:59.176
He just told me that
when the time comes,

04:59.421 --> 05:00.854
I would know what to do.

05:00.879 --> 05:03.757
You're just fine with that? Why?

05:03.884 --> 05:05.325

05:11.175 --> 05:14.311
You remember that IED that took
out my unit in Afghanistan.

05:14.336 --> 05:16.233
I remember that. Of course I do.

05:16.456 --> 05:18.411
You were the only survivor.

05:19.175 --> 05:21.742
Took you years to stop having
nightmares about that blast.

05:21.767 --> 05:23.541
Mar Novu when he first came to me,

05:23.566 --> 05:25.696
he told me he rescued me that day...

05:26.537 --> 05:28.849
because I have a greater purpose.

05:28.874 --> 05:31.089
- And you believed him?
- A grown man in costume

05:31.114 --> 05:32.424

05:32.449 --> 05:34.244
I thought it was a joke,

05:34.371 --> 05:36.468
but then he came to me again,

05:37.393 --> 05:39.309
and he showed me...

05:40.007 --> 05:42.531
us, our future...

05:42.998 --> 05:48.300
just... wiped away,
gone as if it never existed.

05:49.306 --> 05:50.672
So you made a deal with him?

05:50.697 --> 05:52.339

Wow. After everything I've
heard about this place,

06:45.703 --> 06:47.227
I didn't imagine it to be so...

06:47.252 --> 06:48.652
Terrifying?

06:48.677 --> 06:49.930
Beautiful.

06:49.955 --> 06:51.932
Makes sense you'd think so

06:51.957 --> 06:53.800

06:53.825 --> 06:55.492
Maybe not.

I had A.R.G.U.S.
sweep the entire island.

07:55.858 --> 07:57.987

got the coordinates,

07:58.012 --> 08:00.796
but the plutonium landed
in a different spot.

08:00.821 --> 08:02.258
There's a tracker in the case,

but it's nowhere near
Rene, Dinah, or Roy.

08:04.070 --> 08:05.430
JOHN: The people are the priority.

08:05.454 --> 08:07.334
Well, obviously, but we
still need the plutonium

08:07.358 --> 08:08.358
to build the weapon.

of you do, just be careful.

people are or what they want.

08:20.426 --> 08:21.531
JOHN: Copy that.

And I guess that means,
what, the 3 of us,

08:25.538 --> 08:28.103

08:28.128 --> 08:29.478

Gee. Thanks.

It's fair.

08:39.773 --> 08:41.073
Thank you.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.891
William synched this map to
the plutonium's location.

08:50.183 --> 08:51.623
It's gonna get us close to the case,

08:51.647 --> 08:53.247
but the coordinates won't be exact,

08:53.272 --> 08:55.496
so we're gonna have to sweep the area.

08:55.521 --> 08:57.763
Well, the sooner we find it, the better

08:57.788 --> 09:00.468
because I am not a fan of this island.

09:00.493 --> 09:03.694
Yeah? Well, it has
that effect on people.

09:05.164 --> 09:07.174
You know, I, uh... I never expected

09:07.199 --> 09:10.745

you like this, you know.

this Kodak moment

- You and Mia.

avoid a difficult conversation?

want to talk to me, Laurel.

is live up to her father.

Fine. All this father wants
is to complete this mission

have a world to live in.

with more regrets

09:47.473 --> 09:49.422
than you already have buried here.

entire city or island.

20:32.194 --> 20:33.977
Fine. I'll go on my own!

- This is a bad idea.
- Then don't come with me.

20:37.824 --> 20:39.897
You heard Laurel. We
should stick together.

20:39.922 --> 20:42.282
- It's smarter tactically.
- Are you really gonna lecture me

20:42.306 --> 20:43.530

Well... no, but...

20:47.043 --> 20:48.043
Dig is right.

20:48.068 --> 20:50.274
I mean, dad and this
island, they go way back,

20:50.299 --> 20:51.902

20:51.927 --> 20:53.935

could make things worse.

to be afraid of losing him,

21:05.003 --> 21:07.024

that you left things.

you're talking about.

21:08.714 --> 21:11.115

happened with Felicity.

21:11.140 --> 21:13.421
You were angry with her, but
you still wanted to save her.

21:13.445 --> 21:16.211
I'm not just gonna sit
here and do nothing, okay?

21:16.236 --> 21:19.112
I will not leave him
alone out there. I...

21:20.049 --> 21:21.805
I will not...

21:21.830 --> 21:23.353
let him die.

21:25.626 --> 21:27.725
I let myself believe for just...

21:28.308 --> 21:31.284
Just a minute that I could
actually have my dad.

21:32.451 --> 21:36.551
Look. When I was a kid, I spent
a lot of time pushing him away...

21:37.743 --> 21:39.960
because I never thought
that I could lose him,

21:40.722 --> 21:42.088
and then he disappeared.

21:42.113 --> 21:43.946
Yeah. Now we might lose him again.

21:44.151 --> 21:47.136
- How are you so calm about this?
- I'm not, but...

21:47.564 --> 21:49.941
When I was little, Felicity
had me down in that bunker

21:49.966 --> 21:51.609
watching Dad out in the field,

21:51.634 --> 21:54.383
and I saw that he could cheat
death more than anyone,

21:55.207 --> 21:57.124
but if this really is the end,

21:57.802 --> 22:02.673
I don't want to waste the time that
I have left with him being angry.

You realize that
insulting me is not gonna

...cut my way out of a net,
Yao Fei, not shoot an arrow.

is capable of, right?

22:33.869 --> 22:35.402
You could be with your family,

22:35.427 --> 22:36.692
but you chose here instead.

22:36.717 --> 22:39.074
I chose to protect them.

22:39.099 --> 22:42.293
You avoid them because
you're fated to die.

I've been fighting that
fate for a long time.

22:47.165 --> 22:48.825

to do it all over again.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.397
- She was right.
- She normally is.

33:45.049 --> 33:46.854
No. You keep it.

33:47.577 --> 33:49.896
William, what you were able to do,

33:50.662 --> 33:51.917
you're a hero.

33:54.162 --> 33:55.862
Well, I had a pretty good example.

33:55.887 --> 33:58.329
It means a lot to me

33:58.354 --> 34:00.972
that I've had a chance to...

34:01.649 --> 34:04.160
to see the type of man you've become.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.353
I hope you'll forgive me

34:06.378 --> 34:09.958
for... lots of things eventually.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.304
Dad, I already have.

34:12.330 --> 34:14.694
I mean, I know for you
I only left a year ago.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.952
For me, it's been 20 years,

34:18.031 --> 34:19.398
and back then when I was a kid,

34:19.422 --> 34:21.955
I didn't understand what it meant

34:21.980 --> 34:24.856
to fight for something
bigger than yourself,

34:24.880 --> 34:26.422
but now I do,

34:27.706 --> 34:29.639
and I'm really proud of you, dad.

34:29.664 --> 34:31.641
Not as proud as I am of you.

34:34.659 --> 34:37.091
- I'm gonna hug you now.
- You better.

34:53.018 --> 34:55.114
Thinking about where Lyla went?

34:55.661 --> 34:57.449
Can't think about anything else.

35:00.726 --> 35:03.160
I know this is a
sacrifice she has to make

35:03.185 --> 35:05.177
for the multiverse.

35:05.202 --> 35:07.601
I feel like I'm always
asking you favors.

35:07.626 --> 35:09.873
Anything you need, Oliver, always.

35:11.121 --> 35:13.956
I need those kids back in 2040,

35:14.328 --> 35:18.399
somehow, some way before
whatever's gonna happen happens.

35:18.424 --> 35:20.296
Yeah. I was thinking
about the same thing.

35:20.321 --> 35:22.728
I'll make sure they get home safe.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.445
One more thing.

35:25.470 --> 35:27.073
When this is over,

35:27.098 --> 35:29.576
track down Felicity and...

35:30.746 --> 35:32.809
Just tell her that I don't want...

35:34.016 --> 35:38.546
Mia and William kept separated.

35:40.046 --> 35:42.868
I think that they deserve
to grow up with each other.

35:44.396 --> 35:45.880
I'll tell her.

35:45.913 --> 35:46.913
Yeah.

35:47.496 --> 35:50.841
You know, Oliver, I once
told you a long time ago

35:50.866 --> 35:54.921
that a soldier never lets a
brother go into battle alone.

35:57.628 --> 36:00.251
I think that's why it was so
hard for me to accept the idea

36:00.276 --> 36:03.667
that you weren't gonna
make it out of this.

36:04.573 --> 36:06.702
I felt like I'd be failing you.

36:08.336 --> 36:10.485
You could never fail me, John.

36:13.028 --> 36:14.799
I'm gonna stick by your side

36:14.824 --> 36:16.673
for as long as I can,

36:16.915 --> 36:19.097
but I know you have to do this alone.

36:20.549 --> 36:22.615
Every mission has an end.

36:23.151 --> 36:24.984
I wish this one didn't.

36:27.803 --> 36:30.269
I couldn't have done any of this,

36:32.005 --> 36:34.883
any of it without you.

36:36.053 --> 36:37.662
You've always been my rock.

36:37.687 --> 36:39.327
Don't mean the best
man you've ever known?

36:39.351 --> 36:41.084
I also mean that.

36:52.662 --> 36:54.244
Hey. Let's get out of here, man.

36:54.269 --> 36:55.709
Don't want to keep the boat waiting.

36:55.733 --> 36:57.085
I'll be right behind you.

36:57.110 --> 36:58.810
One more thing I got to do.

37:18.367 --> 37:19.733
Hey.

37:19.892 --> 37:21.161
Hey.

37:21.186 --> 37:23.501
Um, William said I might find you here.

37:23.526 --> 37:25.926
Figured you'd be the
first one on the boat.

37:28.656 --> 37:30.322
You okay?

37:33.436 --> 37:35.197
My whole life...

37:35.222 --> 37:37.698
I heard nothing but stories about you,

37:38.086 --> 37:41.525
you know, this legendary
Green Arrow and his team.

37:43.412 --> 37:45.346
I should have been proud of you,

37:47.300 --> 37:49.589
because you were a hero, and...

37:51.597 --> 37:53.330
All I could see is that that is

37:53.355 --> 37:55.355
the reason that you weren't with me,

37:56.067 --> 37:59.587
and it's... it's kind of
hard to let that go.

38:01.348 --> 38:04.727
I never meant to cause you any pain.

38:07.136 --> 38:09.603
Your mom and me just
wanted to protect you.

38:09.628 --> 38:10.933
I know.

38:11.861 --> 38:14.325
I, uh... I understand that now.

38:18.255 --> 38:20.364
For a very long time,

38:20.843 --> 38:22.752
I have hated this place.

38:22.777 --> 38:26.245
Just I'd think about all the
people that it took from me.

38:26.555 --> 38:30.089
It would just... It would
just make me so angry.

38:31.695 --> 38:33.138
But you're not now?

38:33.163 --> 38:35.030
I'm still a little bit angry.

38:36.432 --> 38:39.666
This island taught me to survive.

38:39.905 --> 38:42.059
It turned me into someone else,

38:42.538 --> 38:45.644
somebody better than
the person I was before.

38:49.556 --> 38:51.936
So despite my feelings...

38:53.983 --> 38:57.196
There are no stories about
the Green Arrow to tell...

38:58.821 --> 39:01.291
if I don't make my way to Lian Yu,

39:01.316 --> 39:04.355
and I'm also not
standing at this moment,

39:05.621 --> 39:07.444
looking at my daughter.

39:08.368 --> 39:10.894
Thank you for letting me
be a part of your story,

39:12.868 --> 39:15.111
even if it was only for a little while.

39:17.161 --> 39:20.514
Mia, something tells me you're
gonna create your own stories.

39:33.102 --> 39:34.735
So what now?

39:34.760 --> 39:36.411
We need to get back home,

39:37.051 --> 39:39.937
and just be prepared

39:39.962 --> 39:41.849
for whatever's coming next.

39:41.874 --> 39:42.874
Okay.

39:42.936 --> 39:45.303
[THUNDER]

39:52.693 --> 39:54.059
Dad.

40:00.376 --> 40:02.276
[THUNDER]

40:03.630 --> 40:06.004
- Lyla?
- Not anymore.

40:06.622 --> 40:09.389
I'm now a Harbinger of things to come.

40:09.414 --> 40:11.356
- And that's...
- Yes.

40:12.275 --> 40:14.109
The Crisis has begun.

40:18.639 --> 40:20.246
[THUNDER]

40:25.996 --> 40:28.152
For so many years,

40:28.177 --> 40:30.313
I've traveled across worlds...

40:30.338 --> 40:32.608
_

40:32.633 --> 40:35.351
across the multiverse to do one thing...

40:35.590 --> 40:36.963
Kill you.

40:37.847 --> 40:39.961
And now here...

40:40.795 --> 40:42.468
you saved my life.

40:42.493 --> 40:47.474
VOICE: Submit and begin your life anew.

40:47.643 --> 40:49.075
Show me.

40:49.258 --> 40:52.431
The knowledge is within you.

41:03.090 --> 41:04.675
[BEEP]

41:05.306 --> 41:07.492
