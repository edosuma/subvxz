DOUG, LOOKING AT YOUR
WATCH EVERY 30 SECONDS

00:15.014 --> 00:18.249
IS NOT GONNA MAKE THE
CHINESE FOOD COME ANY FASTER.

00:21.453 --> 00:23.871
YOU HATE THAT
THAT JUST RANG, DON'T YOU?

00:27.726 --> 00:29.294
OH!

00:29.362 --> 00:30.962
YOU COULD NOT
SMELL BETTER.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.830
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THE DAMAGE?

00:32.898 --> 00:34.066
24.50.

00:34.133 --> 00:36.601
ALL RIGHT.

00:36.669 --> 00:37.969
CARRIE, CAN YOU
GET YOUR PURSE?

00:38.036 --> 00:39.070
'CAUSE I'M OUT OF CASH.

00:39.137 --> 00:40.121
I DON'T HAVE ANY CASH.

00:40.189 --> 00:41.323
I THOUGHT
YOU WENT TO THE ATM.

00:41.390 --> 00:43.358
<i>I THOUGHT YOU
WENT TO THE ATM.</i>

00:43.426 --> 00:44.692
YOU, UH,
TAKE CREDIT CARDS?

00:44.760 --> 00:46.811
NO. THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

00:46.879 --> 00:48.780
ALL RIGHT,
YOU STAY THERE.

00:48.848 --> 00:50.582
DON'T TAKE HER AWAY.

00:53.886 --> 00:55.787
UH, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

00:55.855 --> 00:57.088
I'M LOOKIN' FOR MONEY.

00:57.156 --> 00:59.858
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
DROPPED 24.50 UNDER THE CUSHIONS?

00:59.925 --> 01:02.394
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU
GOT OFF YOUR ASS AND HELPED?

01:04.664 --> 01:06.497
MAYBE HE'LL TAKE
SOMETHING ELSE,

01:06.566 --> 01:07.766
LIKE A TRADE
OR SOMETHING.

01:07.833 --> 01:09.884
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

01:09.952 --> 01:11.019
ALL RIGHT.

01:19.061 --> 01:21.262
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:21.330 --> 01:22.730
DON'T YOU WORRY
WHAT I'M DOING.

01:22.798 --> 01:24.466
YOU JUST
GET THE FORKS.

01:24.533 --> 01:26.117
MAYBE YOU PAY ME
NEXT TIME.

01:26.185 --> 01:29.254
OH. OK.

01:31.924 --> 01:33.091
THANKS.

01:38.981 --> 01:41.683
I KNEW CHINESE FOOD
WAY BEFORE I KNEW YOU.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.942
DOUG, DID YOU NOTICE
THAT WE HAVE

02:25.010 --> 02:27.445
4 BOTTLES OF SHAMPOO IN THE
SHOWER THAT ARE ALL EMPTY?

02:27.513 --> 02:29.447
YEAH,
I SAW THAT.

02:29.515 --> 02:32.517
IF YOU SAW THAT, HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T THROW THEM AWAY?

02:32.584 --> 02:34.168
UH, 'CAUSE I WANTED TO GIVE
YOU THE CHANCE TO SEE 'EM

02:34.236 --> 02:36.521
SO WE COULD HAVE
THIS FUN CONVERSATION.

02:36.588 --> 02:38.406
JUST TAKE THEM
TO THE RECYCLER, OK?

02:38.474 --> 02:41.542
TAKE THE GARBAGE
OUT, TOO.

02:41.610 --> 02:43.978
I GOT A SHARP PAIN
IN MY SIDE THIS MORNING.

02:44.046 --> 02:45.947
I MUST HAVE PULLED
SOMETHING LAST NIGHT.

02:46.015 --> 02:47.481
I TOLD YOU,
IT'S KILLING ME.

02:47.549 --> 02:50.184
OK, DOUG, DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO PLAY THIS CARD

02:50.253 --> 02:52.987
TO GET OUT OF A 4-FOOT WALK
TO THE GARBAGE CAN?

02:53.055 --> 02:54.823
'CAUSE THERE'S
A CAT SHOW COMING UP-

02:54.890 --> 02:56.224
OK! ALL RIGHT!

03:02.665 --> 03:04.833
AHHH, IT'S HURTING.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.669
I'M FEELIN' IT.
I'M FEELIN' IT.

03:07.737 --> 03:08.737
UH-HUH.

03:13.408 --> 03:15.110
OH, GOD!

03:18.213 --> 03:20.749
OK, DOUG,
LYING IN GARBAGE,

03:20.816 --> 03:22.250
THAT'S REAL MATURE.

03:22.317 --> 03:24.686
OH, I LIKE
THE TUNA CAN HAT.

03:24.754 --> 03:26.154
THAT'S A GOOD LOOK.

03:26.221 --> 03:28.206
NOW GET UP, DOUG.

03:29.308 --> 03:32.160
DOUG?

03:36.798 --> 03:38.783
DR. GARCIA,
HOW IS HE?

03:38.851 --> 03:40.919
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

03:40.986 --> 03:42.253
LUCKILY HIS APPENDIX
HADN'T BURST YET,

03:42.321 --> 03:43.521
AND WE GOT IT OUT
JUST IN TIME.

03:43.589 --> 03:44.856
OH, THANK GOD.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.057
LISTEN, HE WANTED ME

03:46.125 --> 03:47.291
TO BRING IT HOME
FOR HIM IN A JAR.

03:47.359 --> 03:49.160
IF THAT'S A PROBLEM,

03:49.228 --> 03:50.261
YOU COULD JUST PUT
A RADISH IN THERE.

03:50.329 --> 03:51.996
HE WON'T KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

03:52.064 --> 03:53.798
ANYWAY, I'M JUST GONNA
NEED HIM BACK HERE NEXT WEEK

03:53.866 --> 03:55.266
TO TAKE
THE STITCHES OUT.

03:55.334 --> 03:56.834
OK. CAN I SEE HIM?

03:56.902 --> 03:57.968
SURE. HE'S PROBABLY
STILL SLEEPING

03:58.036 --> 03:59.003
THE ANESTHESIA OFF.

03:59.070 --> 04:01.672
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
JUST BUZZ CANDACE.

04:01.740 --> 04:03.374
OK. THANK YOU.

04:06.545 --> 04:07.779
DOUG?

04:07.846 --> 04:09.196
SWEETIE?

04:14.636 --> 04:18.005
THE DOCTOR SAID YOU'RE
GONNA BE FINE, HONEY.

04:18.072 --> 04:20.057
OHH.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.909
I FEEL AWFUL ABOUT THIS.

04:21.976 --> 04:24.779
I KNOW I SHOULD
HAVE BELIEVED YOU

04:24.846 --> 04:25.980
WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WERE IN PAIN.

04:26.048 --> 04:29.283
IT'S JUST THAT...
YOU LIE TO ME SO MUCH.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.956
WILL YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

04:35.023 --> 04:36.591
YEAH...

04:36.658 --> 04:38.893
CANDACE.

04:38.961 --> 04:40.411
CANDACE THE NURSE?

04:40.479 --> 04:41.846
HONEY, YOU WANT ME
TO GET THE NURSE FOR YOU?

04:41.914 --> 04:43.998
SO HOT, CANDACE.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.217
DOUG, IT'S CARRIE.

04:47.285 --> 04:48.469
LAURA...

04:50.456 --> 04:53.007
THAT'S GOOD, INEZ.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.209
THAT TICKLES.

04:58.013 --> 04:59.931
AW, COME ON, JENNA.

05:02.751 --> 05:04.818
YEAH...

05:04.886 --> 05:06.821
THAT'S IT, CAR...

05:06.872 --> 05:09.474
COME ON, CAR...

05:10.542 --> 05:12.110
...ROLINE.

05:14.463 --> 05:15.830
OK.

05:21.169 --> 05:23.170
CARRIE!

05:24.773 --> 05:26.574
CARRIE,
IS LUNCH READY?!

05:26.642 --> 05:28.376
SURE, YOU KNOW MY NAME

05:28.444 --> 05:29.877
WHEN YOU WANT FOOD.

05:33.582 --> 05:34.331
OH, HI.

05:34.399 --> 05:35.699
HI.

05:35.767 --> 05:37.318
THIS BAND-AID'S
BEEN ITCHING ME.

05:37.386 --> 05:38.586
LET ME GET THAT
FOR YA.

05:38.654 --> 05:39.687
OW!

05:39.755 --> 05:41.021
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN?!

05:41.089 --> 05:42.190
WELL, YOU WERE
JUST PICKIN' AT IT

05:42.257 --> 05:43.274
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL, OK?

05:43.342 --> 05:44.625
IT WAS ANNOYING.

05:44.693 --> 05:45.559
YOU'VE BEEN SNAPPING
AT ME ALL DAY.

05:45.711 --> 05:46.711
WHAT'S UP?

05:46.778 --> 05:49.380
WHY DON'T YOU ASK INEZ
WHAT'S UP?

05:50.532 --> 05:53.367
INEZ? YOU MEAN THE GIRL
FROM LENSCRAFTERS?

05:53.435 --> 05:55.903
YOU TELL ME.

05:55.971 --> 05:57.588
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

05:57.656 --> 06:00.174
OK. WELL, WHILE YOU WERE IN
THE HOSPITAL AFTER THE SURGERY,

06:00.242 --> 06:03.010
WHEN YOU WERE SLEEPING, YOU WERE
MOANING ALL THESE GIRLS' NAMES.

06:03.078 --> 06:04.345
WHAT?
YEAH.

06:04.413 --> 06:05.763
"OH, CANDACE!

06:05.831 --> 06:07.464
"OH, INEZ!

06:07.532 --> 06:09.167
OOH, TANYA."

06:09.234 --> 06:11.052
SICKENING.

06:11.119 --> 06:13.187
NO, THOSE WEREN'T GIRLS.

06:13.355 --> 06:15.990
I WAS HAVING A DREAM
WHERE I WAS HELPING SOMEONE

06:16.058 --> 06:18.476
NAME A LITTER OF PUPPIES.

06:21.630 --> 06:23.297
OH.

06:26.384 --> 06:29.587
WELL, APPARENTLY 2 PUPPIES
NAMED BRITNEY AND CHRISTINA

06:29.654 --> 06:32.490
WERE MAKING OUT WITH YOU
IN A LIMO.

06:34.693 --> 06:36.644
THAT'S 'CAUSE I HAD TREATS
IN MY POCKET.

06:46.522 --> 06:48.256
I- FINE. LOOK,

06:48.323 --> 06:49.857
MAYBE I WAS HAVING
SOME KIND OF CRAZY DREAM,

06:49.924 --> 06:51.942
BUT YOU-YOU KNOW
I LOVE YOU!

06:52.077 --> 06:53.644
YOU KNOW I'M TOTALLY
ATTRACTED TO YOU.

06:53.712 --> 06:55.980
IT'S JUST, LIKE ANY GUY,

06:56.048 --> 06:58.316
ONCE IN A WHILE A...

06:58.400 --> 07:00.618
IMAGE OF ANOTHER WOMAN
JUST POPS INTO MY HEAD,

07:00.686 --> 07:02.086
FOR, LIKE, A SECOND!

07:02.288 --> 07:05.640
BUT YOU'RE M'LADY.
YOU'RE M'HON-AY.

07:05.707 --> 07:06.758
OH, THAT'S FUNNY,

07:06.825 --> 07:10.161
'CAUSE YOUR HON-AY'S
NAME DIDN'T COME UP.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.981
YEAH. THERE WAS A CAR...

07:12.998 --> 07:14.115
ROLINE...

07:14.183 --> 07:16.417
AND, UH, A CAR...

07:16.485 --> 07:18.002
WASHGIRL,

07:18.136 --> 07:20.021
BUT NO "CARRIE."

07:20.088 --> 07:23.407
THAT'S 'CAUSE I DON'T NEED
TO FANTASIZE ABOUT YOU, OK?

07:23.475 --> 07:24.893
YOU'RE THE LIVING FANTASY

07:24.960 --> 07:25.859
THAT I'M HONORED
TO SHARE MY-

07:25.927 --> 07:27.444
OH, WOULD YOU
SHUT UP?

07:27.512 --> 07:30.264
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S
NORMAL, OK? BUT, I MEAN,

07:30.332 --> 07:32.383
THERE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL
ROOM FEELING SORRY FOR YOU,

07:32.451 --> 07:33.300
AND THE NEXT THING
I KNOW,

07:33.368 --> 07:35.186
YOU'RE FANTASIZING
ABOUT CHEATING ON ME

07:35.254 --> 07:36.920
WITH ALL THESE SKANKS!

07:36.988 --> 07:38.389
IT HURTS!

07:38.457 --> 07:39.707
I WASN'T CHEATING, OK?

07:39.775 --> 07:41.442
DOUG,
WE'RE MARRIED, OK?

07:41.510 --> 07:44.261
I'M YOUR WIFE, AND YOU'RE DOING
STUFF IN YOUR HEAD WITH THEM.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.080
HOW IS THAT
NOT CHEATING?

07:46.148 --> 07:48.950
IT'S JUST NOT.
HOW?

07:49.017 --> 07:50.451
YOU'RE NOT...

07:50.519 --> 07:51.669
THERE.

07:51.736 --> 07:53.087
I'M NOT THERE. WHAT,
I'M NOT IN THE ROOM?

07:53.154 --> 07:55.189
I'M NOT
IN THE COUNTRY, WHAT?

07:55.257 --> 07:57.325
YOU'RE NOT...

07:57.392 --> 07:59.093
ALIVE.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.647
OK, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

08:03.715 --> 08:05.999
IN YOUR FANTASIES,

08:06.067 --> 08:08.452
YOU KILL ME?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.838
<i>NO. NO, I DON'T.</i>

08:10.906 --> 08:13.157
IT'S THE RARE DISEASE
THAT KILLS YOU.

08:14.927 --> 08:17.645
OR THE BOLT OF LIGHTNING.

08:17.713 --> 08:19.263
DEFINITELY NOT ME.

08:19.331 --> 08:21.265
OW! THAT WASN'T READY
TO COME OFF YET!

08:21.333 --> 08:23.534
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I'M HEARING HERE!

08:23.601 --> 08:24.702
LET ME EXPLAIN, OK?

08:24.769 --> 08:25.903
PLEASE, DOUG.
EXPLAIN TO ME

08:25.971 --> 08:28.489
WHY I SHOULDN'T BE UPSET
THAT YOU WANT ME DEAD!

08:28.556 --> 08:29.741
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
YOU DEAD, ALL RIGHT?

08:29.808 --> 08:31.626
YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.
I MEAN...

08:31.693 --> 08:33.360
THE TRUTH IS,

08:33.428 --> 08:35.395
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH

08:35.462 --> 08:38.899
THAT I COULD NEVER EVEN
IMAGINE CHEATING ON YOU,

08:38.967 --> 08:40.701
SO THE ONLY WAY I CAN
HAVE ANY FANTASIES AT ALL

08:40.769 --> 08:42.553
IS IF YOU'RE...

08:42.621 --> 08:44.020
UP THERE.

08:48.977 --> 08:51.829
SO TO AVOID
THE GUILT OF ADULTERY,

08:51.896 --> 08:53.764
YOU CHOOSE MURDER?

08:53.832 --> 08:55.783
AGAIN, NOT MURDER.

08:55.851 --> 08:57.568
IN MY FANTASIES,

08:57.636 --> 09:00.437
YOU'RE ALWAYS TAKEN
FROM ME TRAGICALLY.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.590
I'M DEVASTATED.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.644
I GIVE MYSELF 2 YEARS
TO GRIEVE.

09:06.711 --> 09:07.762
AFTER THAT,

09:07.830 --> 09:10.631
EVEN YOUR FRIENDS ARE LIKE,
"YOU GOTTA MOVE ON."

09:11.900 --> 09:14.802
AND WOULD ONE OF
THOSE FRIENDS BE LISA,

09:14.869 --> 09:16.904
MY FRIEND YOU'RE
ALWAYS CHECKING OUT?

09:18.290 --> 09:20.708
SHE MAY BE ONE OF
THOSE CONSOLING ME, YES.

09:20.776 --> 09:23.093
AND DO YOU END UP
SLEEPING WITH HER?

09:23.161 --> 09:25.213
GOD SAKES,
IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS!

09:25.280 --> 09:27.131
OH, MY GOD! OK.

09:27.198 --> 09:28.532
SO WHAT I'M GETTING HERE

09:28.600 --> 09:30.200
IS I'M ELECTROCUTED

09:30.269 --> 09:31.886
AND YOU'RE
BOFFING MY FRIENDS.

09:31.953 --> 09:33.220
NO, NO, IT'S USUALLY
NOT YOUR FRIENDS!

09:33.288 --> 09:34.989
THAT'S NOT TYPICAL
AT ALL.

09:35.057 --> 09:36.357
WHAT IS TYPICAL, DOUG?
OHH!

09:36.424 --> 09:37.875
DO YOU REALLY
WANNA OPEN THIS BOX?

09:37.943 --> 09:39.877
YES, I THINK I DO.

09:39.945 --> 09:41.312
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.114
LIKE...

09:43.182 --> 09:45.333
I'M IN THE PARK,

09:45.401 --> 09:46.734
GRIEVING...

09:47.836 --> 09:49.770
JUST TRYING TO HEAL,

09:49.838 --> 09:51.972
TRYING TO QUIET
THE ENDLESS SCREAM

09:52.040 --> 09:54.725
IN MY SOUL...

09:54.793 --> 09:57.628
WHEN A CHICK IN A SPORTS BRA
COMES OVER TO ME.

09:59.614 --> 10:01.332
UH-HUH.
BUT IT'S INNOCENT, YOU KNOW?

10:01.399 --> 10:02.449
WE JUST START TALKING,

10:02.551 --> 10:03.951
AND THEN I INTRODUCE
HER TO BOBBY.

10:04.019 --> 10:06.220
WHO'S BOBBY?
HE'S OUR SON.

10:06.287 --> 10:07.588
WE HAVE A SON?!

10:07.655 --> 10:08.856
HE'S THE PART OF YOU
THAT LIVES ON.

10:08.923 --> 10:10.524
ALL RIGHT, I DON'T
WANNA HEAR ANY MORE.

10:10.592 --> 10:12.376
WAIT! YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S
A LOT OF JUDGING ME HERE.

10:12.443 --> 10:13.644
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

10:13.711 --> 10:15.830
YOU KNOW, YOU FANTASIZE
ABOUT OTHER MEN, RIGHT?

10:15.897 --> 10:18.683
YEAH, OCCASIONALLY. I'M
DEFINITELY GONNA STEP IT UP NOW!

10:20.469 --> 10:22.803
I'M SERIOUS. LIKE,
WHEN YOU AND KEANU

10:22.871 --> 10:24.555
ARE GETTING IT ON,
WHERE AM I?

10:24.623 --> 10:25.889
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ME?

10:25.957 --> 10:27.108
YOU'RE AROUND!

10:27.176 --> 10:28.225
I'M JUST
CHEATING ON YOU.

10:28.293 --> 10:31.262
I'M NOT PUSHING YOU
DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS!

10:31.329 --> 10:31.395
I DON'T PUSH YOU
DOWN STAIRS!

10:33.081 --> 10:36.250
YOU TRIP
ON BOBBY'S SKATEBOARD!

10:36.317 --> 10:37.869
OH, BITE ME!

10:38.036 --> 10:40.604
WELL, I CERTAINLY SEE
WHERE HE GETS HIS MOUTH FROM!

10:53.552 --> 10:55.219
WHAT ARE THESE?

10:55.287 --> 10:58.756
THESE ARE THE SEX FANTASIES
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE.

11:06.214 --> 11:07.731
YOU...

11:07.783 --> 11:10.201
WROTE FANTASIES FOR ME? YEAH.

11:10.268 --> 11:12.519
LOOK, I KNOW I GOT UPSET
LAST NIGHT, OK?

11:12.587 --> 11:14.155
PEOPLE FANTASIZE.
I GET IT,

11:14.222 --> 11:15.622
BUT I JUST...

11:15.690 --> 11:17.557
CAN'T LET YOU
KILL ME ANYMORE.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.427
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

11:20.495 --> 11:21.428
THAT DOESN'T MEAN

11:21.496 --> 11:22.830
YOU CAN WRITE
FANTASIES FOR ME.

11:22.898 --> 11:25.032
YOU'RE MY WIFE!
SO?

11:25.100 --> 11:26.266
SO?

11:26.334 --> 11:27.618
DO I LET MY CARDIOLOGIST
ORDER FOR ME

11:27.686 --> 11:29.920
AT DER WIENERSCHNITZEL?

11:29.988 --> 11:32.890
WELL, DOUG, I HAPPEN
TO HAVE PROVIDED YOU

11:32.958 --> 11:34.608
WITH ALTERNATIVES
I THINK

11:34.676 --> 11:36.243
ARE QUITE SENSUOUS.

11:36.311 --> 11:38.161
OK, SEE, "SENSUOUS"

11:38.229 --> 11:41.365
IS A RED FLAG ALREADY,
RIGHT THERE.

11:41.432 --> 11:42.967
LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU GOT, THOUGH.

11:43.034 --> 11:45.369
OH, BOY.

11:45.436 --> 11:47.905
"YOU ARE ALONE.

11:47.973 --> 11:49.773
"CARRIE IS AWAY
ON A BUSINESS TRIP

11:49.841 --> 11:51.926
<i>FOR VOGUE MAGAZINE."</i>

11:54.496 --> 11:58.048
"YOU GO TO A FLORIST
TO BUY CARRIE FLOWERS.

11:58.116 --> 12:00.901
THE FLORIST
REMINDS YOU OF CARRIE."

12:00.969 --> 12:02.119
OK, FIRST NOTE:

12:02.187 --> 12:04.822
LITTLE TOO MUCH CARRIE.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.806
ALL RIGHT, THAT
WAS MY FIRST ONE.

12:05.874 --> 12:08.092
THEY GET BETTER.
KEEP GOING.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.127
"YOU FOLLOW
A TRAIL OF ROSE PETALS

12:10.194 --> 12:12.230
TO A CANOPIED BED."

12:16.201 --> 12:18.685
"YOU RIDE A HORSE
ACROSS A FIELD... "

12:29.747 --> 12:32.666
<i>OK, I'M PRETTY SURE THIS ONE
WAS A DHARMA AND GREG.</i>

12:32.734 --> 12:33.784
DOUG, COME ON!

12:33.819 --> 12:35.369
I WORKED HARD
ON THESE, OK?

12:35.436 --> 12:37.104
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS HAVE AN OPEN MIND.

12:37.172 --> 12:38.472
THIS IS CRAZY!
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS!

12:38.540 --> 12:40.291
I- I'M ON A HORSE.

12:40.358 --> 12:41.826
I'M BIKING
THROUGH WINE COUNTRY.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.494
WHY I AM SO ACTIVE?

12:47.432 --> 12:48.766
DO YOU KNOW
IN MY OWN FANTASIES,

12:48.834 --> 12:51.335
I RARELY
GET OUT OF A CHAIR?

12:53.438 --> 12:55.056
LOOK,

12:55.123 --> 12:58.225
THESE ARE YOUR FANTASIES
NOW, OK?

12:58.293 --> 13:02.129
AND YOU BETTER
START USING THEM,

13:02.197 --> 13:04.831
'CAUSE IF I FIND OUT
I'M DEAD,

13:04.900 --> 13:06.033
YOU'RE DEAD.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.624
"YOU TAKE HER HAND
IN YOURS

13:13.692 --> 13:18.095
"AS THE GONDOLIER
LOOKS DISCREETLY AWAY.

13:18.162 --> 13:19.497
"YOU STROKE HER HAIR

13:19.564 --> 13:24.368
AND SHE WHISPERS,
AMORE."

13:24.436 --> 13:27.404
DAMN!

13:27.472 --> 13:28.940
OHH!

13:29.007 --> 13:30.591
OH, IT GETS BETTER. I'M
ABOUT TO PICK UP A MANDOLIN

13:30.658 --> 13:32.793
AND START SINGING.

13:32.860 --> 13:33.777
HEY, IF
THESE CARRIE FANTASIES

13:33.845 --> 13:35.562
AREN'T QUITE WORKING
FOR YOU,

13:35.630 --> 13:37.831
MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE
YOUR MOM FIRE OFF A FEW.

13:39.567 --> 13:41.051
YOU GUYS ARE FUNNY.
LAUGH IT UP, YOU KNOW?

13:41.119 --> 13:42.352
BUT CARRIE'S
MAKING ME DO THESE.

13:42.420 --> 13:43.587
MAKING YOU?
HOW'S CARRIE GONNA KNOW

13:43.655 --> 13:44.788
WHAT YOU'RE
FANTASIZING ABOUT?

13:44.856 --> 13:45.923
SHE KNOWS THINGS, OK?

13:45.991 --> 13:47.290
I MEAN, HOW DID
SHE KNOW I WAS THE ONE

13:47.358 --> 13:49.293
WHO GOT RUSSIAN DRESSING
ON OUR WEDDING ALBUM?

13:49.361 --> 13:53.481
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
COULD'VE CONNECTED THOSE DOTS.

13:53.548 --> 13:54.465
THAT'S NOT EVEN THE POINT.
ALL RIGHT?

13:54.532 --> 13:56.133
LOOK, CARRIE'S FEELINGS
WERE REALLY HURT ABOUT THIS.

13:56.201 --> 13:58.236
I JUST CAN'T BLOW HER OFF.

13:58.303 --> 14:00.571
ALL RIGHT?
I FEEL TOO GUILTY.

14:00.638 --> 14:02.573
SOME OF THESE
AREN'T THAT BAD.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.659
HEY, THIS ONE'S GOT
HER NAIL GIRL TINA IN IT.

14:05.727 --> 14:06.660
SHE'S PRETTY HOT.

14:06.728 --> 14:08.562
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

14:08.630 --> 14:09.764
I'M GONNA HIT IT.

14:09.831 --> 14:11.399
YEAH, ME, TOO.

14:11.466 --> 14:14.302
HEY, CAN I, UH,
BORROW THIS ONE?

14:14.369 --> 14:15.836
WHICH?

14:15.904 --> 14:18.272
THE ONE WITH, UH,
MEREDITH BAXTER-BIRNEY.

14:20.325 --> 14:22.860
I'LL GET IT BACK
TO YOU WHEN I'M DONE.

14:22.928 --> 14:25.329
MY GIFT TO YOU.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.231
THANK YOU.

14:27.298 --> 14:28.566
OH, AND IF ANYTHING
WITH JUDITH LIGHT

14:28.633 --> 14:29.667
COMES ACROSS
YOUR DESK, UH,

14:29.735 --> 14:31.168
SHOOT IT MY WAY,
WILL YA?

14:33.321 --> 14:35.005
ALL RIGHT, TINA,

14:35.073 --> 14:36.907
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

14:43.131 --> 14:45.148
OH, DOUG,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

14:45.216 --> 14:46.817
CAN YOU PAY TINA?

14:46.885 --> 14:47.968
I'M MEETING DONNA KARAN.

14:48.003 --> 14:50.604
WE'RE GONNA PLAY DARTS
AT CALVIN KLEIN'S PLACE.

14:50.671 --> 14:51.605
OH. SURE.

14:51.756 --> 14:52.840
GREAT. THANKS.

14:54.293 --> 14:58.062
OH, AND I WON'T BE BACK
FOR A FEW HOURS. OK?

15:01.149 --> 15:03.116
AHEM.

15:03.185 --> 15:04.218
WHOOPS. I...

15:04.286 --> 15:05.886
SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN MY WALLET. I-

15:06.771 --> 15:08.355
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GONNA PAY YOU.

15:08.423 --> 15:11.892
WELL, THAT'S
VERY BAD NEWS.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.062
IS THERE
ANY OTHER WAY

15:15.130 --> 15:17.231
WE COULD, UH,
WORK THIS OUT?

15:19.151 --> 15:21.101
I'M SURE WE CAN THINK
OF SOMETHING.

15:24.305 --> 15:25.572
UH...

15:25.640 --> 15:27.007
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

15:27.075 --> 15:29.310
IT'S JUST...

15:29.377 --> 15:31.378
MY WIFE.

15:33.998 --> 15:37.401
SHE SAID SHE WON'T
BE BACK FOR HOURS.

15:37.469 --> 15:38.785
RIGHT.

15:43.191 --> 15:45.409
OHH, I-I CAN'T-
I- I-LOOK, I-I-

15:45.444 --> 15:46.777
I JUST
NEED A MINUTE HERE.

15:54.485 --> 15:55.969
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT WAS THAT?

15:56.037 --> 15:57.271
MY WIFE. SHE'S DEAD.

15:57.338 --> 15:58.805
NOW WHERE WERE WE?

16:01.777 --> 16:04.528
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
WEREN'T GOING TO KILL ME!

16:05.714 --> 16:06.630
I DIDN'T MEAN TO!

16:06.698 --> 16:07.898
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAD A DEAL.

16:07.966 --> 16:10.083
NOW YOUR LITTLE PARTY'S
OVER, BUDDY.

16:10.151 --> 16:11.985
OUT.

16:12.053 --> 16:14.254
OUT! LOOK TO ME. OUT.

16:15.657 --> 16:17.425
WHO'S BACK THERE?

16:17.492 --> 16:19.159
NOBODY.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.234
WHO ARE THEY?!

16:27.302 --> 16:29.103
MY FRIENDS?

16:29.170 --> 16:30.271
THESE-

16:30.338 --> 16:31.855
THESE ARE THE WOMEN
YOU FANTASIZE ABOUT.

16:31.923 --> 16:33.840
THESE ARE
YOUR REGULARS!

16:33.908 --> 16:35.276
ACTUALLY,
SHE'S NOT A REGULAR.

16:35.343 --> 16:37.378
I SAW HER ON A BILLBOARD
THIS MORNING.

16:37.445 --> 16:39.012
ALL RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT? LET'S GO, LADIES.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.147
OUT. LET'S GO.

16:40.215 --> 16:42.682
PARTY'S OVER.
TIME TO GO.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.718
LET'S GO, HEE HAW.

16:47.856 --> 16:50.040
OH, UH-HUH.
NICE. YEAH.

16:50.108 --> 16:50.874
YOU, TOO, FOOD COURT.

16:50.941 --> 16:53.026
I SEE YA. I SEE YA.

16:53.094 --> 16:55.062
UH-HUH. OH,
THERE'S SPORTS BRA.

16:55.130 --> 16:56.196
THAT'S NICE, YEAH.

16:56.264 --> 16:58.298
VILLAGE PEOPLE
MAKE A COMEBACK? OK.

16:58.366 --> 16:59.566
THAT'S GREAT.

17:02.737 --> 17:05.138
IS THAT ONE OF
YOUR MOM'S FRIENDS?

17:07.058 --> 17:08.776
YOU'RE SICK!

17:15.817 --> 17:18.251
GET OUT
OF MY BRAIN.

17:18.319 --> 17:19.453
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:19.521 --> 17:21.188
I TRIED ONE OF
YOUR LITTLE FANTASIES.

17:21.255 --> 17:22.623
IT DIDN'T WORK, AND NOW
THAT YOU'RE IN HERE,

17:22.691 --> 17:23.924
NONE OF MY OLD FANTASIES
WORK EITHER.

17:23.992 --> 17:25.792
YOU CHASED
EVERYONE AWAY!

17:25.861 --> 17:28.127
LOOK, I JUST DON'T
WANT YOU TO KILL ME.

17:28.195 --> 17:30.698
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK!

17:30.765 --> 17:32.899
I AM TIRED
OF APOLOGIZING FOR THIS.

17:32.967 --> 17:34.635
KILLING OFF YOUR SPOUSE
IN YOUR FANTASIES

17:34.703 --> 17:37.971
IS THE MOST NATURAL,
BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WORLD!

17:38.039 --> 17:39.973
WHY CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

17:40.041 --> 17:41.741
HEY, DOUG. HOW ARE
THOSE STITCHES DOING?

17:41.809 --> 17:43.477
OH, THEY'RE, UH-
THEY'RE GOOD.

17:43.544 --> 17:45.296
HE HASN'T BEEN BITING
AT 'EM, HAS HE?

17:45.363 --> 17:47.280
NO.

17:47.348 --> 17:49.549
JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES
TO GET 'EM OUT.

17:49.617 --> 17:52.820
<i>AND WHILE YOU WAIT, YOU CAN
ENJOY A VERY OLD PEOPLE MAGAZINE.</i>

17:52.888 --> 17:55.288
OH! OK.

17:55.356 --> 17:56.289
BYE.

18:25.903 --> 18:27.688
MRS. HEFFERNAN?

18:27.755 --> 18:30.257
I'M AFRAID THE STITCH
REMOVAL DIDN'T GO WELL.

18:31.793 --> 18:33.126
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:33.194 --> 18:35.179
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS...

18:35.246 --> 18:36.846
YOUR HUSBAND...

18:36.914 --> 18:38.499
HE'S DEAD.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.621
HONEY!

18:43.688 --> 18:46.223
I LOVED YOU
SO MUCH!

18:47.892 --> 18:49.392
A WOMAN
AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU

18:49.460 --> 18:51.578
SHOULD NOT BE CRYING.

18:51.646 --> 18:52.780
WHY?

18:52.847 --> 18:54.581
WHAT SHOULD
I BE DOING?

18:54.649 --> 18:55.582
DANCING!

18:55.650 --> 18:57.584
UNO, DOS, TRES, CUATRO!

20:03.351 --> 20:04.818
CARRIE.

20:04.886 --> 20:05.886
CARRIE!
HUH?

20:05.954 --> 20:07.521
YES. I'M DONE. EVERYTHING'S FINE.

20:07.588 --> 20:10.891
OH, WELL,
THAT'S GREAT, SWEETIE!

20:10.959 --> 20:11.892
"SWEETIE"?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.426
WHAT'S UP WITH-

20:13.494 --> 20:14.662
YOU'RE NOT MAD
ANYMORE?

20:14.729 --> 20:16.396
NO. NO, I WAS
JUST SITTING HERE

20:16.464 --> 20:18.632
THINKING ABOUT, UH,

20:18.700 --> 20:20.717
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.

20:20.785 --> 20:22.318
COME ON, LET'S
GO GET SOME ICE CREAM.

21:14.204 --> 21:15.389
WHO ARE YOU?

21:15.456 --> 21:18.475
I'M JOSEPHINE.
YOUR WIFE SENT ME.

21:18.543 --> 21:20.160
OH.

21:20.228 --> 21:22.129
DOUG HEFFERNAN. HI.

21:27.852 --> 21:30.036
OH, WHAT THE HELL.
