00:01.411 --> 00:02.300
Mail...

00:03.119 --> 00:04.119
mail...

00:04.697 --> 00:05.697
bills...

00:06.001 --> 00:07.001
Ah.

00:07.709 --> 00:08.912
"Dr. Charlie Harris."

00:12.627 --> 00:13.630
Ooh.

00:15.419 --> 00:18.506
"Here's wishing you
a <i>Speedy Gonzales</i> recovery."

00:18.698 --> 00:20.955
"Signed, your neighbors
Mr. and Mrs. Bent."

00:21.731 --> 00:25.363
Well, despite their sincere
and well-meaning wishes,

00:25.397 --> 00:26.614
I'm gonna toss it.

00:26.649 --> 00:28.533
Besides, they keep using
our parking space.

00:30.569 --> 00:32.537
Why is it I'm never prepared?

00:32.783 --> 00:35.540
The signs are always there.
I'm bitchy. I'm bloated.

00:35.574 --> 00:37.025
Do you have a tampon?

00:37.059 --> 00:38.409
No. Sorry.

00:38.443 --> 00:40.378
What?

00:40.412 --> 00:42.580
Wait. I'm thinking in my head.

00:42.614 --> 00:43.798
Are you late?

00:43.833 --> 00:45.867
Yeah.

00:47.152 --> 00:49.973
Charlie's accident was six weeks ago.

00:50.010 --> 00:51.122
Are you usually late?

00:51.140 --> 00:53.508
Don't try to doctor me, Mel.
Uh, maybe it's stress.

00:53.559 --> 00:55.226
Or... oh, my god... you're pregnant.

00:55.261 --> 00:57.762
You... don't say that out loud!

00:58.168 --> 01:00.298
A-and you can't tell anyone.
Do you promise?

01:00.316 --> 01:01.632
Okay. I promise.

01:01.650 --> 01:02.984
It's probably not anything.

01:03.018 --> 01:04.986
I'm gonna go... to my rounds.

01:05.019 --> 01:06.654
Yeah. No.

01:06.689 --> 01:08.356
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Wait.

01:09.692 --> 01:10.942
Pregnant?

<i>- The Great Randall -</i>

01:45.260 --> 01:47.228
35-year-old male driver in M.V.C.

01:47.262 --> 01:49.397
Traveling approximately
50 kilometers an hour.

01:49.431 --> 01:50.481
Air bags?

01:50.516 --> 01:52.900
No. Accident happened
around 30 minutes ago.

01:52.935 --> 01:56.887
G.C.S. is 15. All vitals stable on scene.

01:57.718 --> 01:58.523
Is that rebar?

01:58.557 --> 01:59.690
Yeah.

01:59.962 --> 02:01.609
Wow. That's amazing. Let me guess.

02:01.660 --> 02:04.112
He hit the back of a truck
carrying construction gack?

02:04.163 --> 02:06.080
- Uh-huh.
- I love it when I'm right.

02:06.115 --> 02:07.448
Uh, morphine?

02:07.499 --> 02:08.449
None.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.449
Why not?

02:09.501 --> 02:11.202
We were worried about hypotension.

02:11.236 --> 02:12.703
Then why isn't he screaming?

02:12.737 --> 02:13.838
I don't know.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.573
He should be in incredible,
terrifying pain.

02:15.591 --> 02:17.859
That is not normal.

02:17.893 --> 02:19.627
How are you doing today?

02:19.678 --> 02:20.911
I'm good.

02:20.929 --> 02:22.763
Are you feeling any discomfort at all?

02:22.798 --> 02:24.465
No. Not at all.

02:24.516 --> 02:25.466
What's your name?

02:25.517 --> 02:27.084
Uh... No idea.

02:27.119 --> 02:28.252
Did he hit his head?

02:28.270 --> 02:30.688
No.

02:30.722 --> 02:32.190
All right. Well, we're gonna
take good care of you.

02:32.224 --> 02:33.591
Lin, let's make sure his airway's okay.

02:33.609 --> 02:34.725
We'll reassess his vitals,

02:34.759 --> 02:36.118
open his I.V., slip in a catheter.

02:36.154 --> 02:36.940
Get him to X-ray.

02:36.970 --> 02:39.397
We'll do a chest and abdominal
flat plate and a C.T.

02:39.431 --> 02:40.931
Right away.

02:41.933 --> 02:43.067
Hello.

02:43.101 --> 02:44.435
Hi.

02:47.439 --> 02:49.240
- Hey, Maggie.
-  Hey, Joel.

02:49.274 --> 02:50.541
Hey, I tried calling you last night.

02:50.576 --> 02:51.742
You didn't answer.

02:51.776 --> 02:53.944
I was at a movie or something, I guess.

02:53.962 --> 02:56.414
Okay. Well, if you get
a moment later on today,

02:56.448 --> 02:57.748
let's, uh, let's hang out.

03:00.052 --> 03:01.335
Is that a "yes"?

03:01.386 --> 03:03.954
Sure. For sure. Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

03:03.972 --> 03:06.290
Okay. Well, uh, then I'll text ya.

03:06.308 --> 03:10.011
Okay. With your fingers.
Let's make a plan.

03:10.062 --> 03:11.179
Is that rebar?

03:11.230 --> 03:13.814
Yes, it is.

03:20.239 --> 03:22.106
"Mr. Happy"?

03:22.140 --> 03:24.475
That's what we're calling him.

03:24.493 --> 03:26.027
He has amnesia?

03:26.078 --> 03:29.697
That's the working theory,
and he doesn't feel any pain.

03:29.748 --> 03:31.832
He has a piece of rebar
sticking out his chest.

03:31.867 --> 03:33.534
I know.

03:33.585 --> 03:35.319
He should be in agony.

03:35.337 --> 03:37.705
Yeah. Tell me about it.

03:37.756 --> 03:39.490
I'm worried it might be
tamponading an artery.

03:39.508 --> 03:41.659
If we remove it, he could bleed out.

03:41.677 --> 03:42.877
Rib fractures, front and back.

03:42.928 --> 03:44.328
Do you want me to call Dr. Goran in?

03:44.346 --> 03:46.514
- I got it.
- Mm.

03:49.268 --> 03:50.518
Hi. I'm Dr. Reid.

03:50.552 --> 03:51.519
Hi.

03:51.553 --> 03:54.555
Ouch. How are you feeling, sir?

03:54.606 --> 03:55.973
I'm feeling only good feelings.

03:56.007 --> 03:58.442
Can you move your left leg for me?

03:58.477 --> 03:59.843
Mm-hmm.

03:59.861 --> 04:01.979
Good. Now your right leg.

04:02.013 --> 04:04.482
You don't remember your name?

04:04.516 --> 04:06.150
No. I was driving, and then, um,

04:06.184 --> 04:07.652
and then I hit a truck.

04:07.686 --> 04:10.688
And you don't remember anything?
Your address, a phone number?

04:10.706 --> 04:12.039
No.

04:13.208 --> 04:14.742
I'll see you in a few minutes.

04:14.793 --> 04:16.360
Uh, you have kind eyes.

04:16.378 --> 04:17.878
Thank you.

04:22.884 --> 04:25.035
Hi, Ms. Day. I am Dr. Lin.

04:25.053 --> 04:27.054
It says here you fell down.

04:27.089 --> 04:28.589
My mother pushed me down the stairs,

04:28.640 --> 04:30.508
and now I can't move my neck.

04:30.542 --> 04:32.042
You can see it's crooked.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.894
Can you bend your neck the other way?

04:33.929 --> 04:35.179
No.

04:35.213 --> 04:37.348
Did the paramedics give
you any medication?

04:37.382 --> 04:40.735
Mnh-mnh. Those medics
weren't very sympathetic...

04:40.769 --> 04:42.603
or kinetic.

04:42.654 --> 04:44.272
It's pathetic.

04:44.323 --> 04:45.773
Yeah, they can be a little abrupt.

04:45.824 --> 04:47.692
Okay, Heather, you just stay put,

04:47.726 --> 04:50.161
and we'll get your neck X-rayed
as soon as we can, okay?

04:54.916 --> 04:55.899
So it looks like the pole went

04:55.917 --> 04:57.368
through the third and fourth ribs,

04:57.402 --> 04:59.003
and he's got multiple fractures
due to the force of the impact.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.838
He's got a small lung
contusion right there.

05:00.872 --> 05:02.840
He has paradoxical
motion of the chest wall

05:02.874 --> 05:04.675
and a hemopneumothorax.

05:04.710 --> 05:06.594
- Flail chest.
- Yeah.

05:06.628 --> 05:08.796
Okay, well, due to
the extent of the fractures,

05:08.847 --> 05:10.881
we're gonna have to
stabilize the flail segment,

05:10.915 --> 05:12.850
but it is true...

05:12.884 --> 05:13.851
He's in no pain?

05:13.885 --> 05:15.353
Looks like it.

05:15.387 --> 05:16.537
Any theories?

05:16.571 --> 05:18.739
No. I'm guessing it has
to do with the amnesia.

05:18.774 --> 05:20.141
Drugs?

05:20.175 --> 05:22.476
No. His tox screen is clear.

05:22.527 --> 05:24.779
Go ahead. Talk to him yourself.
Maybe you can figure it out.

05:24.813 --> 05:26.697
You just don't have my
amazing bedside manner.

05:26.732 --> 05:28.399
Watch and learn.

05:34.239 --> 05:35.289
Hi there.

05:35.324 --> 05:37.041
Hi there.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.876
I'm Dr. Goran.

05:38.910 --> 05:40.778
So, listen, before I can operate,

05:40.796 --> 05:42.446
I need to know if you've
taken any other medications

05:42.464 --> 05:45.383
which would explain
why you are not feeling any pain.

05:45.417 --> 05:49.253
No. I haven't taken a thing,
you know, cross my heart.

05:49.287 --> 05:50.954
Yeah. You got... that was a pretty...

05:50.972 --> 05:52.640
Yeah. That was a strange thing to say.

05:52.674 --> 05:55.109
All right. Mister...

05:55.143 --> 05:59.630
sir, uh, normally, before we operate,

05:59.648 --> 06:00.798
we wait till we get a bit
of a medical history,

06:00.816 --> 06:02.933
but we really can't wait in this instance.

06:02.967 --> 06:05.569
Dr. Reid will extract the rebar.

06:05.604 --> 06:07.021
I will make an incision to make sure

06:07.072 --> 06:09.640
no blood vessels and organs
have been damaged, okay?

06:09.658 --> 06:11.659
And I will plate the ribs.

06:11.693 --> 06:16.113
Oh. If this is your only issue,
why wouldn't I just...

06:16.147 --> 06:17.281
- Hey, no, don't!
- No!

06:19.034 --> 06:20.651
Propofol, 180.

06:20.669 --> 06:22.820
Get him tubed!

06:22.838 --> 06:24.672
I'm gonna do a crash thoracotomy.

06:24.706 --> 06:27.958
Oh, my god. How are we doing?

06:27.992 --> 06:29.677
We're working on it.

06:29.711 --> 06:30.795
Pressure's gone. Betadine?

06:30.829 --> 06:33.714
Dump it on him. Do you have him tubed yet?

06:33.765 --> 06:34.715
- Now he is.
- Great.

06:34.766 --> 06:35.716
Okay. Knife.

06:35.767 --> 06:37.017
Yeah.

06:37.052 --> 06:38.302
You gotta get in there.

06:38.336 --> 06:39.603
Fifth interspace.  Here we go.

06:39.638 --> 06:41.138
Mm-hmm.

06:41.172 --> 06:42.556
Retractor.

06:42.607 --> 06:44.007
Retraction coming in.

06:44.025 --> 06:46.727
Going in.

06:46.778 --> 06:49.280
Okay. You got the aorta?

06:49.314 --> 06:51.699
Yeah. I think so.
It's got a huge tear in it.

06:53.535 --> 06:55.453
Suction. Right here.

06:55.487 --> 06:56.821
Listen, you've gotta pump
everything you've got

06:56.855 --> 06:59.523
into this guy... you know,
blood, fluids, everything.

07:01.293 --> 07:04.495
I'm gonna clamp the aorta
proximal and distal to the tear.

07:06.214 --> 07:07.081
Doctor.

07:07.232 --> 07:08.433
And one more.

07:10.069 --> 07:11.352
Okay, I think I have it controlled,

07:11.403 --> 07:12.854
but we don't have much time.

07:12.905 --> 07:15.323
We need to fix the tear,
remove the clamps,

07:15.357 --> 07:17.191
and restore blood flow
to the spinal column.

07:17.242 --> 07:18.526
His pressure's going back up.

07:18.977 --> 07:21.712
Holy hell.

07:41.802 --> 07:42.651
Heather?

07:42.855 --> 07:44.988
It's best if you stay near your bed.

07:45.121 --> 07:46.622
I'm waiting to see a doctor.

07:46.656 --> 07:47.789
You don't need to see another doctor.

07:47.824 --> 07:49.741
We're just waiting to get you into X-ray.

07:49.775 --> 07:52.277
They keep changing all the rules.

07:52.295 --> 07:55.163
Let's just get you back to bed for now.

07:55.214 --> 07:56.548
Kapow.

07:58.468 --> 08:00.168
You had a close call there, sir.

08:00.219 --> 08:01.286
Well, yeah.

08:01.304 --> 08:03.005
I guess pulling that thing out of my chest

08:03.056 --> 08:05.090
wasn't the best plan.

08:05.124 --> 08:06.425
No, it really wasn't.

08:06.459 --> 08:08.760
- As I was trying to tell you, when you...
- Yeah.

08:08.794 --> 08:11.813
Unimpaled myself.

08:11.848 --> 08:13.181
A segment of your rib cage was detached.

08:13.232 --> 08:14.983
Now I plated it back together,

08:15.018 --> 08:16.785
and Dr. Reid repaired
the tear in your aorta.

08:16.819 --> 08:18.120
Wow.

08:18.154 --> 08:19.488
You're lucky to be alive.

08:20.078 --> 08:22.307
You guys are top-notch.

08:22.342 --> 08:24.343
This hospital is top-notch.

08:24.377 --> 08:26.194
What's the food like here?

08:26.229 --> 08:28.613
Well, you're gonna be in
rough shape for a bit.

08:28.647 --> 08:31.608
I'm not sure that
you're gonna want to eat quite yet.

08:31.682 --> 08:33.485
- Personal effects.
- Let's take a look at this.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.453
Is that my stuff?

08:35.488 --> 08:36.538
We want to see if the medics
missed anything.

08:36.589 --> 08:37.539
Do you mind?

08:37.590 --> 08:39.124
No. Please. Go ahead.

08:39.158 --> 08:40.207
This is a morphine drip.

08:40.259 --> 08:43.128
If the pain gets any worse,
press that button.

08:43.162 --> 08:45.881
Right. Remember, though,
I'm not feeling any pain.

08:45.932 --> 08:46.882
Still?

08:46.933 --> 08:48.050
No.

08:48.101 --> 08:49.051
Check this out.

08:51.437 --> 08:53.305
Who is "The Great Randall"?

08:53.339 --> 08:54.556
I have no idea.

08:54.607 --> 08:55.724
He's a hypnotist.

08:55.775 --> 08:57.225
A hypnotist?

08:57.276 --> 08:58.977
Yeah. The great Randall.
He does performances.

08:59.011 --> 09:01.446
He's on all the talk shows.
Do you guys never go out?

09:02.532 --> 09:04.349
Are we thinking he's been hypnotized?

09:04.367 --> 09:08.570
That is not what I was thinking, no.

09:08.621 --> 09:09.955
Uh, what are we thinking?

09:11.874 --> 09:14.710
I need to talk to Gavin.

09:14.744 --> 09:17.362
In some people, hypnosis
can have an extreme effect.

09:17.380 --> 09:18.797
This extreme?

09:18.831 --> 09:20.716
Hypnosis isn't entirely understood.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.968
Some people's brains
physiologically change

09:23.002 --> 09:24.336
under hypnosis.

09:24.370 --> 09:26.037
Then there are the people who
are especially suggestible,

09:26.055 --> 09:28.540
like those who were
a victim of child abuse

09:28.558 --> 09:30.708
or spent time in cults.

09:30.727 --> 09:32.394
We don't know this guy's story.

09:32.428 --> 09:33.711
Why not just leave him hypnotized?

09:33.730 --> 09:35.313
Because it's masking.

09:35.348 --> 09:38.049
Morphine masks pain. I'm just sayin'.

09:38.067 --> 09:40.051
I can't have a postoperative
patient in a trance.

09:40.069 --> 09:41.553
It's irresponsible.

09:41.571 --> 09:44.072
I can't tell what's going
on if he can't feel it.

09:44.107 --> 09:45.190
I'm not a hypnotist.

09:45.224 --> 09:47.526
Just try. Please?

09:52.415 --> 09:53.448
Hello.

09:53.499 --> 09:54.800
Hello.

09:54.834 --> 09:57.753
I'm Gavin Murphy. I'm a psychiatrist here.

09:57.787 --> 10:01.406
Uh...  I'd like you
to take a deep breath...

10:01.424 --> 10:02.740
- Mm-hmm.
- And relax for me.

10:02.759 --> 10:04.909
All right.

10:04.927 --> 10:07.596
And follow my finger.

10:08.798 --> 10:11.466
Now I'm gonna count backwards from ten.

10:11.517 --> 10:15.887
I want you to watch my
finger until you get sleepy.

10:15.921 --> 10:18.923
Ten... nine...

10:18.941 --> 10:20.258
Have you done this before?

10:20.276 --> 10:23.428
Yes. To great effect, I might add.

10:23.446 --> 10:24.579
Mm-hmm.

10:24.614 --> 10:27.949
Eight... seven...

10:27.984 --> 10:29.818
six...

10:29.869 --> 10:30.869
Watch the finger.

10:30.903 --> 10:32.270
Are you, uh... Yeah, I'm watching.

10:32.288 --> 10:33.989
Actually, okay,

10:34.040 --> 10:36.458
I'm gonna get you to close your eyes.

10:36.492 --> 10:37.459
Now?

10:37.493 --> 10:38.493
Yes, please.

10:38.544 --> 10:39.494
Close your eyes.

10:39.545 --> 10:40.778
Yes. My eyes are now closed.

10:40.797 --> 10:43.465
Now I want you to just
let your mind wander.

10:43.499 --> 10:44.499
Mm.

10:44.550 --> 10:46.751
Let it wander wherever it wants to go.

10:46.785 --> 10:50.338
Now tell me, what do you see?

10:50.389 --> 10:51.723
My eyelids.

10:56.929 --> 10:58.680
You'd better call the other guy.

10:58.731 --> 10:59.764
The great...

10:59.798 --> 11:01.966
Randall.

11:04.737 --> 11:07.239
Hey. You paged me?

11:07.273 --> 11:09.074
Yeah, I have a patient with a neck injury

11:09.108 --> 11:11.476
who says her mom pushed
her down the stairs.

11:11.494 --> 11:13.778
Okay. That's not really a psych issue.

11:13.812 --> 11:16.531
She's just acting really weird.
Something's off.

11:16.582 --> 11:17.749
In what way?

11:17.783 --> 11:21.086
She's nonsensical.
She's... rhyming randomly.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.255
Rhyming? Out of the blue,
no context to it?

11:23.289 --> 11:24.339
None.

11:24.373 --> 11:25.874
Sounds like it could be clang association.

11:25.925 --> 11:27.459
- Where is she?
- Clang what?

11:27.493 --> 11:29.961
It's, uh, it's a form of
speech that includes rhyming.

11:29.995 --> 11:32.130
- It happens in patients that have m...
-  Hey!

11:32.164 --> 11:34.599
I heard what you said. Hey! I heard it.

11:34.634 --> 11:37.469
Don't pretend like you didn't.
I am sick of you, too!

11:37.503 --> 11:39.271
Hey, calm down. Calm down.

11:39.305 --> 11:42.941
Have shoes.
Clues. Bruise. Blues. Clues.

11:42.975 --> 11:45.310
- Misuse. Bruise.
- I need haloperidol and lorazepam.

11:45.344 --> 11:46.978
- What's her name?
-  Heather.

11:47.012 --> 11:48.563
"Why don't you just go kill yourself?!"

11:48.614 --> 11:49.814
That's what they say to
me all the time.

11:49.848 --> 11:51.700
"I'm not buying you any more presents!"

11:51.734 --> 11:54.903
Okay. Hi, Heather. My name's Gavin.

11:54.954 --> 11:56.705
- You're too tall.
- You're too tall.

11:56.739 --> 11:58.189
Can I just talk to you for a second?

11:58.207 --> 12:00.191
You want to strap me down like an animal?!

12:00.209 --> 12:02.410
Guys, guys, guys. Back off.
Back off! Back off.

12:02.461 --> 12:03.662
- Back off.
- I got it.

12:03.696 --> 12:04.880
Heather.

12:04.914 --> 12:06.965
Heather, I can tell that
you're really upset.

12:06.999 --> 12:08.583
Can we just talk about
it for a little bit?

12:08.634 --> 12:10.385
Gavin. Gavin.

12:10.419 --> 12:12.254
Yeah, nothing
rhymes with "Gavin," right?

12:12.305 --> 12:13.672
You gave that picture a headache.

12:13.706 --> 12:16.007
You're giving me a headache!

12:16.041 --> 12:17.008
Gavin, we're gonna have to do this.

12:17.042 --> 12:18.176
she's a danger to the other patients.

12:18.210 --> 12:19.177
Heather, we're gonna have to give you

12:19.211 --> 12:20.395
- some medication, all right?
- No.

12:20.429 --> 12:21.763
It's gonna help you feel
a little bit better,

12:21.814 --> 12:23.398
- all right?
- No. No. I don't w... I don't want it.

12:23.432 --> 12:25.267
- No, I don't want it!
- It's okay. It's okay.

12:25.318 --> 12:26.551
- I don't want it!
- There's just gonna be a pinch, all right?

12:26.569 --> 12:27.903
Just a pinch.  Okay.

12:27.937 --> 12:29.387
- Let go of me. You're ruining it.
- All right?

12:29.405 --> 12:30.689
- You always ruin everything.
- It's okay. It's okay.

12:32.491 --> 12:35.360
There you go. There you go.
Grab her feet. Grab her feet.

12:35.394 --> 12:36.361
There you go. It's okay.

12:36.395 --> 12:38.580
Okay.

12:38.614 --> 12:40.732
Okay.

12:42.785 --> 12:44.252
Thank you.

12:44.287 --> 12:46.871
Yeah.

12:51.910 --> 12:53.428
I couldn't take the test.

12:53.462 --> 12:55.630
You mean you tried?

12:55.665 --> 12:57.048
I went down to the pharmacy.

12:57.082 --> 13:00.385
I-I bought a pee stick, but I didn't pee.

13:00.419 --> 13:02.137
You should pee. It's better to know.

13:02.188 --> 13:03.555
Is it?

13:03.589 --> 13:06.057
Well, you can't avoid it forever.

13:06.091 --> 13:08.310
Well, I would've avoided
it a few months ago, too.

13:08.361 --> 13:10.562
Juggling a kid while
I'm still in my residency?

13:10.596 --> 13:14.399
But now, even with everything...

13:14.433 --> 13:15.817
I want it.

13:15.868 --> 13:18.219
Then take the test.

13:19.938 --> 13:21.373
Ohh.

13:22.608 --> 13:25.276
Gotta go.

13:29.332 --> 13:30.882
<i>Most people come into a hospital</i>

13:30.916 --> 13:32.334
<i>in some kind of pain.</i>

13:34.887 --> 13:37.055
<i>The maternity ward,
in particular, is filled</i>

13:37.089 --> 13:41.125
<i>with the agonized screams
of women in labor.</i>

13:43.346 --> 13:45.930
<i>It's the happiest place
in the hospital.</i>

13:50.403 --> 13:51.353
Hi.

13:51.404 --> 13:53.355
I'm here to see Dr. Reid.

13:53.406 --> 13:54.689
What's the name?

13:54.740 --> 13:56.658
Uh, Randall.

13:56.692 --> 13:57.826
<i>Mr.</i> Randall?

13:58.567 --> 14:00.028
Uh, no. Just Randall.

14:00.079 --> 14:01.413
She said to page her when I got here.

14:01.447 --> 14:03.031
- Okay.
- Thank you.

14:03.082 --> 14:06.368
<i>Dr. Reid, there's a Randall
in reception for you.</i>

14:06.419 --> 14:08.920
Dr. Reid, Randall in reception.

14:08.954 --> 14:10.488
Nice tux, buddy.

14:12.758 --> 14:13.792
Randall?

14:13.826 --> 14:16.261
That's me.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.830
If you'll follow me.

14:18.848 --> 14:20.932
Absolutely.

14:26.689 --> 14:28.723
I want you to listen very carefully

14:28.774 --> 14:31.059
to the sound of my voice.

14:31.110 --> 14:34.062
I want you to listen,
but I don't want you to think.

14:34.113 --> 14:36.564
I'm gonna count backwards from three,

14:36.615 --> 14:39.484
and on three, I'd like
you to do three things.

14:39.518 --> 14:42.186
I want you to close your eyes,

14:42.204 --> 14:44.823
I want you to take a deep breath,

14:44.857 --> 14:46.574
and I want you to relax your arms.

14:46.625 --> 14:51.129
And on two, I want you to do two things...

14:51.163 --> 14:53.465
breathe out and imagine yourself

14:53.499 --> 14:57.034
in a quiet, quiet room.

14:57.053 --> 15:01.873
And on one, I want you
to do just one thing...

15:01.891 --> 15:03.875
look up.

15:03.893 --> 15:06.461
And three...

15:06.495 --> 15:08.546
two...

15:08.564 --> 15:09.898
one.

15:09.932 --> 15:12.067
Awake!

15:12.101 --> 15:14.736
- Did it work?
- What's your name?

15:14.770 --> 15:16.571
- Chester Mills.
- And what's your address, Chester?

15:16.605 --> 15:18.890
202 westbridge drive.

15:18.908 --> 15:21.326
Hey, no, no, no, no, no... Aah!

15:21.360 --> 15:22.610
- Oh, that... ohh!
- Chester?

15:22.661 --> 15:24.746
It hurts.
My stomach hurts so bad!

15:24.780 --> 15:25.747
Morphine's not working.

15:25.781 --> 15:26.748
- It will, Chester.
- Ohh!

15:26.782 --> 15:28.249
- Push an extra 2 1/2.
- Aah.

15:29.285 --> 15:30.251
Did you say, "stomach"?

15:30.286 --> 15:31.736
Yes! My stomach!

15:31.754 --> 15:32.754
Why did you wake me up?

15:32.788 --> 15:34.756
Why did you have to do that? Aah.

15:34.790 --> 15:37.292
I was better off before. Aah!

15:37.343 --> 15:41.913
<i>Doctors call pain "the fifth vital sign,"</i>

15:41.931 --> 15:46.301
<i>but unlike the other four,
you want it to stop.</i>

15:51.425 --> 15:52.759
Careful of your sutures.

15:52.793 --> 15:54.427
No, you know what? It is not the surgery.

15:54.462 --> 15:55.629
That is really sore,

15:55.680 --> 15:56.963
But it's nothing compared to the pain...

15:57.014 --> 15:58.932
That's why he came to me
in the first place, right,

15:58.966 --> 16:00.016
this pain of his?

16:00.051 --> 16:01.101
Ohh.

16:01.135 --> 16:02.769
There's pain in his lower quadrant.

16:02.803 --> 16:04.721
Is it possible that
the catheter punctured his bladder?

16:04.755 --> 16:07.107
We had a hard time getting it in.
It's possible.

16:07.141 --> 16:09.425
O-okay, s... Chester.

16:09.443 --> 16:11.144
I am going to send you for a cystoscopy.

16:11.195 --> 16:13.697
No. No, you're not. Listen, stop.

16:13.731 --> 16:15.231
Please? Please stop. Please?

16:15.265 --> 16:19.152
I've had this pain
for <i>years,</i> all right?

16:19.203 --> 16:20.654
- How many years?
- I don't know!

16:20.705 --> 16:21.955
I don't know. Like, five, maybe.

16:21.989 --> 16:23.456
I've seen a ton of doctors,
a ton of doctors,

16:23.491 --> 16:25.992
and nobody ever helped me,
nobody except for him today.

16:26.043 --> 16:27.577
"I know but one freedom,"

16:27.611 --> 16:29.746
"and that is the freedom of the mind."

16:29.780 --> 16:31.748
Antoine de Saint-Exupery.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.667
Okay, Randall, you can't be in here.

16:35.836 --> 16:37.504
We are going to get to the bottom of this.

16:37.555 --> 16:39.122
Nobody ever gets to the bottom of this.

16:39.140 --> 16:41.841
Stop. Stop. Okay, can we
just for a second just stop,

16:41.892 --> 16:43.459
take a... take a breath,

16:43.477 --> 16:46.479
just-just for a second,
please, and listen?

16:46.918 --> 16:47.453
Okay.

16:47.483 --> 16:49.849
Yeah? I can't work, okay?

16:49.900 --> 16:51.968
I have no money,
and I can't get disability

16:51.986 --> 16:53.820
because everyone just
thinks that this in my head,

16:53.854 --> 16:55.321
so don't... please just don't tell me

16:55.356 --> 16:58.191
that you're gonna fix me,
because I don't believe you.

16:58.242 --> 17:00.827
Listen, I'm gonna go over
your medical records.

17:00.861 --> 17:01.945
Just a fresh set of eyes.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.363
I might be able to see something that

17:03.397 --> 17:04.998
the previous doctors have missed...

17:05.031 --> 17:07.916
Ohh. And in the meantime, just to be safe,

17:07.952 --> 17:09.752
will you please take this one test?

17:09.787 --> 17:11.487
What's the point?

17:11.505 --> 17:13.673
You've just had surgery. You're in pain.

17:13.708 --> 17:15.825
I want to make sure
it's nothing we've done.

17:15.843 --> 17:17.844
Uh...

17:17.877 --> 17:20.329
Fine. Yeah. Test me.

17:20.347 --> 17:22.182
Thank you.

17:22.215 --> 17:25.685
Will you please take
Chester down to cysto?

17:25.720 --> 17:26.685
And up his morphine.

17:27.722 --> 17:28.688
Okay?

17:28.723 --> 17:31.024
Yeah.

17:34.395 --> 17:35.695
What are you still doing here?

17:35.730 --> 17:39.032
Oh. Who do I, uh,
talk to about compensation?

17:39.066 --> 17:40.400
For?

17:40.451 --> 17:42.685
Well, for coming here and doing this.

17:42.703 --> 17:43.953
Well, this is a hospital,

17:43.988 --> 17:46.372
not a stage show, so think of it

17:46.407 --> 17:49.492
as your good deed for the day.

17:49.526 --> 17:53.029
You have a great sadness
about you, Dr. Reid.

17:53.063 --> 17:55.331
Right.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.300
There you go,

17:57.334 --> 17:59.535
and thanks again.

18:05.426 --> 18:07.927
Uh, excuse me.

18:11.766 --> 18:14.400
So how come you can see me?

18:15.786 --> 18:17.604
Do you mean no one else can?

18:17.655 --> 18:19.072
No.

18:19.106 --> 18:21.574
Because you're dead?

18:21.609 --> 18:23.076
Not quite, but close.

18:23.110 --> 18:24.360
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

18:24.394 --> 18:26.412
No one else knows I'm here. Hey!

18:26.447 --> 18:27.914
- I need you to do something for me.
-  No.

18:27.948 --> 18:29.532
You do something for <i>me,</i> okay?

18:29.566 --> 18:31.251
Leave me alone.

18:31.285 --> 18:32.585
What?

18:38.292 --> 18:39.575
That your rebar guy?

18:39.593 --> 18:42.462
Yeah. Five years' worth
of medical records.

18:42.513 --> 18:45.465
He's been tested for lupus,
crohn's, irritable bowel.

18:45.516 --> 18:47.050
It's brutal.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.218
Oh, well.

18:49.787 --> 18:51.387
What do you mean, "oh, well"?

18:51.421 --> 18:52.806
I mean, you got
the thing out of his chest.

18:52.857 --> 18:54.274
You saved his life.

18:54.308 --> 18:56.392
You've done your part. Go with god.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.061
Zach, this guy's seen a dozen internists.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.112
Nobody's helped him.

18:59.146 --> 19:00.613
You know, the key to not going crazy

19:00.648 --> 19:02.282
is that you help a patient,

19:02.316 --> 19:04.784
and when they're feeling better, you stop.

19:04.819 --> 19:06.286
This guy feels worse again.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.571
Yeah, but you only know about it
because you didn't stop in time.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.573
That's my point.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.625
That's the emergency medicine way?

19:12.660 --> 19:14.110
Yeah.

19:14.128 --> 19:15.461
Look, I get it.

19:15.496 --> 19:17.330
You're numbing yourself with work.

19:17.381 --> 19:19.132
No, I'm not.

19:19.166 --> 19:21.284
Every doctor he's seen
has failed Chester Mills.

19:21.302 --> 19:23.286
I don't want to add my name to that list.

19:23.571 --> 19:25.454
You didn't happen to
keep the rebar, did you?

19:25.472 --> 19:27.257
No. Why?

19:27.291 --> 19:31.144
Just teaching purposes. It's fine.

19:31.178 --> 19:33.346
Wait.

19:33.397 --> 19:36.015
Ohh.

19:36.066 --> 19:37.267
Listen to me.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.968
The last time they caught
me talking to a dead guy,

19:38.986 --> 19:40.987
they put me in the mental, so buzz off!

19:41.021 --> 19:43.472
I'm not dead, and
the woman I love needs to know

19:43.490 --> 19:44.858
I'm trying to get back to her.

19:44.909 --> 19:46.025
Too bad.

19:46.076 --> 19:48.494
I am not your savior.
I am not your messenger.

19:48.529 --> 19:49.779
Please! I am <i>begging</i> you!

19:49.813 --> 19:52.615
I think she's pregnant!

19:52.649 --> 19:53.649
She needs to know that it's okay,

19:53.667 --> 19:56.819
that I-I want to be a father.

20:02.927 --> 20:06.629
I didn't push her down the stairs.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.598
She imagined it?

20:08.632 --> 20:10.499
She believes it.

20:10.517 --> 20:12.185
She has delusions.

20:12.219 --> 20:16.556
Sometimes things happen.

20:16.607 --> 20:18.725
She fits them into a conspiracy.

20:18.776 --> 20:21.677
Her neck does seem hurt.

20:21.695 --> 20:23.980
We can X-ray it now that she's calmer.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.782
Thank you.

20:27.201 --> 20:28.868
Can you give us a minute?

20:28.903 --> 20:30.353
Mm-hmm.

20:30.371 --> 20:32.655
Does she go off her meds often?

20:32.689 --> 20:34.357
Sometimes.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.192
I just noticed she's taking perphenazine.

20:36.210 --> 20:38.578
I think there are more effective meds now.

20:39.713 --> 20:41.748
We've tried everything.

20:41.799 --> 20:43.032
And nothing's working?

20:43.050 --> 20:45.668
Well, sure, things work for a while,

20:45.702 --> 20:46.836
but she's an adult.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.172
I-I can't control her behavior,

20:49.206 --> 20:51.707
make her take her pills,
behave appropriately.

20:51.725 --> 20:53.893
You can support her, uh, which you are,

20:53.928 --> 20:56.045
and I think changing
her medication might...

20:56.063 --> 20:59.315
Dr. Murphy, I'm sorry,
but you don't have a plan.

21:00.601 --> 21:03.386
Unless you do. So what is it?

21:05.439 --> 21:08.724
She's never getting better.

21:08.742 --> 21:10.610
I'm... I'm coming to terms with it,

21:10.661 --> 21:12.078
but people like you,
who give me false hope,

21:12.112 --> 21:13.613
just make it worse.

21:13.664 --> 21:14.614
She can improve.

21:14.665 --> 21:16.232
And then?

21:16.250 --> 21:18.067
There'll be another disaster.

21:18.085 --> 21:19.419
I'm just happy that the police didn't have

21:19.453 --> 21:21.337
to bring her in this time.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.344
Honey. Aah!

21:30.247 --> 21:32.131
How are you feeling, huh?

21:32.182 --> 21:35.018
Dr. Too tall. He stabbed me in the arm.

21:35.052 --> 21:36.886
This whole thing is a bad situation.

21:42.726 --> 21:44.310
What is it? Was there a complication?

21:44.361 --> 21:46.646
Not from the surgery. It's his face.

21:49.950 --> 21:52.869
Ohh. Ohh. Hey.

21:52.903 --> 21:54.404
Get your test results back?

21:54.438 --> 21:56.289
Okay, Chester, were you in the sun

21:56.323 --> 21:58.607
the entire time the medics
were working on you?

21:58.625 --> 22:01.377
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, I was,
and this is what happens, doc.

22:01.412 --> 22:03.496
I don't, uh, I don't burn. I-I bubble up.

22:03.547 --> 22:05.915
Either the ozone layer's
completely disappeared,

22:05.949 --> 22:07.283
or you are a vampire.

22:07.301 --> 22:08.617
Yeah, you got that right, pal.

22:08.635 --> 22:10.219
Eternal life of agony.

22:11.955 --> 22:12.922
Lupus.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.390
Ohh. Come on, Dr. Reid.

22:14.425 --> 22:16.259
Photosensitivity is a telltale symptom.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.344
So is pain. Abdominal pain.

22:18.395 --> 22:20.013
Yeah. I've been tested.

22:20.064 --> 22:21.514
So let's test you again.

22:21.565 --> 22:23.566
Ohh.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.352
Yeah. Fine. I want something in return.

22:26.403 --> 22:27.770
What?

22:27.804 --> 22:30.656
Find the great Randall.
Bring him down here again.

22:30.691 --> 22:32.658
Have him send me back to oblivion.

22:32.693 --> 22:34.810
Chester, it... it's not a solution.

22:34.828 --> 22:38.031
No? What is?

22:56.715 --> 22:58.683
Aah. Ow!

22:58.717 --> 23:00.351
Aah! Aah, aah, aah!

23:00.385 --> 23:02.186
Ow.

23:02.221 --> 23:04.171
did you just bite me?

23:04.189 --> 23:06.507
Yeah. I had an impulse.

23:13.565 --> 23:15.316
Ohh. Okay.

23:15.350 --> 23:17.473
Okay. Are you mad at me?
Did I do something?

23:18.382 --> 23:20.816
You brought Dr. Reid in on
a surgery that you promised me,

23:20.876 --> 23:23.267
and you never call me
unless you want to have sex.

23:23.334 --> 23:25.380
Well, I thought that was the deal...

23:25.577 --> 23:26.466
Uh, for both us.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.134
We're h... we're having fun, right?

23:28.368 --> 23:29.652
But not more.

23:30.969 --> 23:33.159
Are we having "the talk"?

23:33.741 --> 23:35.285
No. No.

23:35.529 --> 23:37.194
Because I've been completely honest

23:37.222 --> 23:38.589
with you here, Maggie, about this.

23:38.640 --> 23:42.176
I...  I'm not up for
a relationship right now.

23:42.210 --> 23:45.212
I don't have it in me,
and I don't want to lead you on.

23:45.230 --> 23:47.214
Okay.

23:47.232 --> 23:50.518
Then I think our transaction
is done, Dr. Goran.

23:50.552 --> 23:51.903
I'm sorry. Our what?

23:51.937 --> 23:53.938
I've had a great time,
it's been super fun,

23:53.989 --> 23:56.491
you're a really smart guy
and you're good company.

23:56.525 --> 23:59.059
I'll-I'll see you around the hospital.

24:00.162 --> 24:02.730
I am not shaking your hand.

24:02.748 --> 24:05.566
Joel, it's been fun.
Let's just shake and be friends.

24:13.792 --> 24:17.411
My whole life I've been
haunted by spooks like you.

24:17.429 --> 24:19.630
The only way I escape is
getting high or drunk.

24:19.681 --> 24:21.916
Okay, well, before you do that,

24:21.934 --> 24:24.251
could you please get a
message to Alex for me?

24:24.269 --> 24:26.253
Uh, I don't know.

24:26.271 --> 24:29.307
I don't understand.
What do you have to lose?

24:29.358 --> 24:31.392
Do you think having this curse is fun?

24:31.426 --> 24:33.561
People think I'm nuts.

24:33.595 --> 24:35.980
Or worse... they believe me and
then they're hounding me,

24:36.031 --> 24:37.932
trying to get in touch with uncle Arthur

24:37.950 --> 24:39.567
or little Bobby or...

24:39.601 --> 24:42.036
I have to be very,
very careful who I, uh...

24:42.070 --> 24:43.371
I'm not exactly

24:43.405 --> 24:45.406
in the most normal
circumstances here myself.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.908
You're half in, half out.

24:46.942 --> 24:48.659
What? What'd you say?

24:48.710 --> 24:50.828
You haven't fully accepted
what you're going through.

24:50.879 --> 24:51.879
I can tell.

24:53.465 --> 24:55.550
- Morning. Can I get a coffee?
- There she is.

24:56.785 --> 24:59.754
Oh, Dr. Reid. Small world.

24:59.788 --> 25:01.672
Would you please just...
just-just talk to her?

25:01.723 --> 25:02.840
For me?

25:02.891 --> 25:04.508
Why should I?

25:04.560 --> 25:06.961
Because you're a decent man.

25:06.979 --> 25:09.313
Dr. Reid.

25:10.849 --> 25:12.567
Is there something with our coffee?

25:12.601 --> 25:14.151
People don't normally
hang out in the hospital.

25:16.021 --> 25:17.855
Could I talk to you for a second?

25:17.906 --> 25:18.856
Okay.

25:18.907 --> 25:23.143
I, um...

25:23.161 --> 25:24.328
How's Chester?

25:24.363 --> 25:26.113
He's recovering.

25:26.147 --> 25:28.783
Tell her you're talking to Charlie.
She'll believe you.

25:31.003 --> 25:32.453
What's going on?

25:32.487 --> 25:34.505
You're gonna find this a bit weird.

25:34.539 --> 25:38.426
Um, I was on my way out.

25:38.460 --> 25:41.345
You're gonna think I'm nuts,
but I started picking up

25:41.380 --> 25:43.163
on a spirit.

25:44.332 --> 25:46.267
Name's Charlie.

25:49.504 --> 25:52.273
Who told you about Charlie?

25:52.307 --> 25:54.692
He did, and he won't shut up.

25:54.726 --> 25:56.694
Charlie's here right now? Okay.

25:56.728 --> 25:58.012
Uh, where? Where? Where is he?

25:58.030 --> 25:59.697
I'm right beside you.

25:59.731 --> 26:01.449
Tell her I'm-I'm...
I'm glad she's wearing the necklace

26:01.483 --> 26:04.652
I bought for her last birthday.

26:04.686 --> 26:06.854
- Is this some kind of a joke?
- He's glad you're wearing

26:06.872 --> 26:08.556
the necklace he got you
for your last birthday.

26:08.590 --> 26:10.908
How did you know that?

26:10.959 --> 26:13.811
He's here. He's listening.

26:15.213 --> 26:18.032
You're lying.

26:18.050 --> 26:19.533
Why would I lie? Huh?

26:19.551 --> 26:20.551
I don't know.

26:20.585 --> 26:21.886
So you could think I'm crazy? Uh...

26:21.920 --> 26:23.871
If you don't believe me, go.

26:23.889 --> 26:25.222
Go!

26:25.257 --> 26:26.891
Fine.

26:26.925 --> 26:29.060
What if I am telling the truth, though?

26:29.094 --> 26:31.211
Huh?

26:31.229 --> 26:33.314
Listen to me. He's right there.

26:46.778 --> 26:48.612
Charlie.

26:52.084 --> 26:53.734
Alex.

26:56.905 --> 26:59.090
If you're there...

27:00.909 --> 27:02.626
I need you to wake up.

27:02.678 --> 27:05.513
Oh, god. I know, baby.

27:05.547 --> 27:07.765
I know. I'm-I'm trying. I'm trying.

27:07.799 --> 27:09.083
Tell her I'm... tell her I'm trying.

27:09.101 --> 27:13.087
Tell her she needs to have faith.

27:13.105 --> 27:17.892
Uh, tell her I'm here.
Tell her I'm right here.

27:17.926 --> 27:19.777
Tell her to believe in me.

27:21.229 --> 27:22.279
Anything?

27:22.314 --> 27:24.115
What are you waiting for? Tell her.

27:27.202 --> 27:29.236
You get paid to do your job, eh, doc?

27:29.270 --> 27:31.122
What are you doing?

27:33.041 --> 27:34.575
You're not serious.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.544
What? You-you called me
here to wake up Chester.

27:36.578 --> 27:38.579
Now you want me to talk to your boyfriend.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.131
Wow. I'm an idiot.

27:40.165 --> 27:41.632
She's gonna think you're hustling her.

27:41.666 --> 27:43.217
What are you doing?
No, all I'm saying is

27:43.251 --> 27:45.302
- there's gotta be something in this for me.
- You know what? I...

27:45.337 --> 27:47.588
I believed you for-for just a minute.

27:47.622 --> 27:50.508
No. No. No. What are you doing?

27:50.559 --> 27:52.459
- Oh.
- Alex.

27:52.477 --> 27:54.228
Alex!

27:54.262 --> 27:55.930
Alex!

27:57.899 --> 28:01.652
- Charlie...
- What the hell were you thinking?

28:01.686 --> 28:03.270
You were my one chance,

28:03.304 --> 28:04.972
my only chance.

28:04.990 --> 28:07.141
It's gone now.

28:26.316 --> 28:27.285
Just checking in.

28:28.118 --> 28:29.425
Morphine's not working.

28:29.572 --> 28:31.019
It'll only give you so much.

28:31.372 --> 28:33.406
Why don't you get up and
walk around a little?

28:33.440 --> 28:34.641
Oh, like a little light jog

28:34.675 --> 28:37.760
or some. Uh, what...
 cross-training?

28:38.277 --> 28:39.250
Chester.

28:39.939 --> 28:41.180
It might make you feel better,

28:41.215 --> 28:42.748
and after a surgery, you should.

28:43.613 --> 28:44.576
All right.

28:45.019 --> 28:45.969
Okay.

28:46.020 --> 28:47.220
Okay. Here we go.

28:47.254 --> 28:49.439
Are you gonna walk with me?

28:49.473 --> 28:50.657
Sure.

28:50.691 --> 28:52.959
So is there anyone you should be calling?

28:53.094 --> 28:55.729
Tell them you're here?
You must have a girlfriend or something.

28:55.763 --> 28:56.830
Ooh.

28:56.864 --> 28:57.964
Okay.

28:57.999 --> 28:58.999
Thank you.

28:59.033 --> 29:00.050
Yeah.

29:00.084 --> 29:03.386
Yeah, she, uh, she left a while ago.

29:03.421 --> 29:05.388
She couldn't take it.

29:05.423 --> 29:07.340
She didn't think the pain was real.

29:07.374 --> 29:08.926
Sorry to hear that.

29:08.977 --> 29:12.262
Yeah. I used to be, uh,
a pretty happy-go-lucky guy.

29:12.813 --> 29:14.898
You know what's hilarious?

29:14.932 --> 29:16.049
Mm?

29:16.067 --> 29:18.568
I used to be a salesman.

29:18.603 --> 29:19.986
What did you sell?

29:20.021 --> 29:22.489
Sold cars.  Yeah.

29:22.523 --> 29:24.691
But you really just sell yourself.
That's what they say,

29:24.725 --> 29:27.527
and since my brand, you know, so to speak,

29:27.561 --> 29:30.897
kinda became, uh, became this,

29:30.915 --> 29:33.450
I, um...

29:33.501 --> 29:35.902
I'm not really feeling that much better.

29:35.920 --> 29:38.505
I think I'd like to go back and lie down.

29:38.539 --> 29:39.572
Okay.

29:39.590 --> 29:40.874
Okay.

29:47.798 --> 29:49.266
I just heard about your freaky patient.

29:49.300 --> 29:50.800
Yeah. Abdominal pain,

29:50.851 --> 29:54.253
strange blood counts, blistering.

29:54.272 --> 29:55.772
- Blistering?
- Mm-hmm.

29:55.806 --> 29:57.557
I told you, garlic and a holy water enema

29:57.591 --> 29:59.142
might do the trick.

29:59.193 --> 30:01.444
He did have a stake
going through his chest.

30:01.479 --> 30:02.629
Just noticing a connection.

30:02.663 --> 30:04.864
My patient is really suffering, Reycraft,

30:04.899 --> 30:06.316
and not just from photosensitivity.

30:06.367 --> 30:07.651
The guy's a vampire.

30:07.702 --> 30:10.236
- Who's gonna tell him?
-  Guys.

30:10.270 --> 30:12.271
Vampire.

30:12.290 --> 30:14.307
Jackson, I love you.

30:14.992 --> 30:16.543
Joel, do you have five
minutes to come to the lab

30:16.577 --> 30:18.128
and try something bizarre?

30:18.162 --> 30:19.629
Okay.

30:28.506 --> 30:30.140
I shouldn't have come in.

30:30.174 --> 30:32.842
Why not? The E.R.'s here for everybody.

30:32.893 --> 30:34.811
You don't have to be
bleeding out to ask for help.

30:34.845 --> 30:37.914
Not that I know what I'm talking
about because I'm crazy.

30:37.949 --> 30:42.152
Heather, I told your mother I'd
like to rejig your drug regimen,

30:42.186 --> 30:44.971
and I really think that you
would benefit from talk therapy.

30:44.989 --> 30:47.357
I talk all the time.
It just makes me worse.

30:47.408 --> 30:49.109
You have auditory hallucinations.

30:49.143 --> 30:51.077
The hate voices?

30:51.112 --> 30:53.479
"I'm sick of you."
"Why don't you die already?"

30:53.497 --> 30:55.832
Do they ever abate? Are they ever quiet?

30:55.866 --> 30:57.483
They-they can't be quiet.

30:57.501 --> 30:59.703
They keep coming at me,
and they just get smarter.

30:59.737 --> 31:03.340
Talking to me can help
give you perspective,

31:03.374 --> 31:06.376
but you have to stick to your meds.

31:06.427 --> 31:08.995
I go off my meds because
they make me feel closed in.

31:09.013 --> 31:10.680
- I know.
- No, you don't.

31:10.715 --> 31:12.799
My other world is scary,

31:13.624 --> 31:15.218
but I have friends there.

31:15.252 --> 31:18.688
S-sometimes it's easier to live
there than it is to live here.

31:18.723 --> 31:20.991
Your neck.

31:21.025 --> 31:22.559
That could be dystonia.

31:22.610 --> 31:25.779
It's a reaction to the
dopamine-blocking drugs

31:25.813 --> 31:27.781
that have built up in your system.

31:27.815 --> 31:29.449
May I?

31:38.743 --> 31:41.694
How did you do that?

31:41.712 --> 31:44.581
It's a sensory trick.
It doesn't always work.

31:44.632 --> 31:46.166
How did you do that?

31:46.200 --> 31:48.301
I don't know.

31:48.335 --> 31:49.719
You have magic hands.

31:49.754 --> 31:52.088
Just regular hands.

31:52.139 --> 31:53.873
They're magic.

31:53.891 --> 31:55.541
I can tell.

31:57.428 --> 31:58.595
Why don't you stick around then?

31:58.646 --> 32:00.513
Okay.

32:00.547 --> 32:02.381
Great.

32:04.485 --> 32:06.403
Porphyria.

32:06.437 --> 32:07.937
The vampire disease.

32:07.988 --> 32:10.774
Yes. I've never seen it,
but I did med school simulations.

32:10.825 --> 32:12.058
And it's incredibly difficult to diagnose,

32:12.076 --> 32:14.060
because it mimics other diseases.

32:14.078 --> 32:17.063
- Was he tested for it?
- Not that I can see, no.

32:17.081 --> 32:20.250
Okay, we're good to go. Hit the lights.

32:20.284 --> 32:21.835
Okay, so what exactly
are we looking for here?

32:21.869 --> 32:23.169
If he has porphyria,

32:23.204 --> 32:25.905
his urine will turn neon
pink under the black light.

32:25.923 --> 32:28.875
If it doesn't, we're back to square one.

32:37.635 --> 32:38.868
Disco pee.

32:38.903 --> 32:41.888
Patient's porphyrin levels
must be through the roof.

32:41.922 --> 32:44.774
Chester has porphyria. I can't believe it.

32:44.809 --> 32:46.776
Run a blood and urine test to confirm.

32:46.811 --> 32:49.446
I have an answer for him.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.098
In a nutshell, your body is overproducing

32:52.116 --> 32:53.432
something called a porphyrin.

32:53.451 --> 32:54.767
Now these porphyrins
are actually attacking

32:54.785 --> 32:57.987
your whole system... your nerves,
your muscles, your skin.

32:58.038 --> 33:00.657
And my gut. That's why I'm
always in so much pain, yeah?

33:00.708 --> 33:03.576
Yes. You say it comes and goes, right?

33:03.610 --> 33:05.662
Yeah. Well, porphyria causes attacks,

33:05.713 --> 33:07.130
and some are worse than others.

33:07.164 --> 33:09.666
Are you sure about this?

33:09.717 --> 33:12.302
Without a doubt.
I know what's wrong with you.

33:15.789 --> 33:18.007
You have no idea how long
I've waited to hear that.

33:18.058 --> 33:20.126
We will set you up with
a hematologist right away,

33:20.144 --> 33:22.128
and they're gonna go over
everything that you need to do

33:22.146 --> 33:24.814
to prevent another attack.
You need to stay out of the sun,

33:24.849 --> 33:27.600
cut out alcohol, avoid stress.

33:27.634 --> 33:28.935
Okay.

33:28.969 --> 33:30.987
It will be trial and error for a while.

33:31.021 --> 33:33.940
Well, uh, what do you mean?

33:33.974 --> 33:35.024
Just until you find the other things

33:35.075 --> 33:36.192
that trigger the attacks, and once you do,

33:36.243 --> 33:38.027
you'll be able to manage your disease.

33:38.078 --> 33:40.113
But I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna manage it.

33:40.147 --> 33:41.647
You're gonna... you're gonna cure it.

33:41.665 --> 33:45.535
This is a lifelong condition.

33:45.586 --> 33:47.570
There is no cure.

33:49.256 --> 33:51.457
But...

33:51.491 --> 33:53.492
Chester, this still is good news.

33:56.430 --> 33:59.849
Yeah, a-a little... a little bit.

33:59.884 --> 34:01.167
Thank you.

34:01.185 --> 34:03.219
- Chester...
- No, mystery solved.

34:03.270 --> 34:06.022
You did a really good job, Dr. Reid.

34:06.056 --> 34:08.007
Thanks for trying...

34:08.025 --> 34:10.610
Thanks for trying to help me.

34:13.697 --> 34:15.815
Okay.

34:18.351 --> 34:23.856
<i>If you can name it,
but you can't change it,</i>

34:23.873 --> 34:25.658
<i>is it really better to know?</i>

34:27.328 --> 34:29.145
I feel like I'm going crazy.

34:29.179 --> 34:30.830
I'm going crazy. Take the damn test.

34:30.864 --> 34:31.880
Don't!

34:31.916 --> 34:34.467
Mel.

34:37.638 --> 34:39.639
Alex, you know you
wouldn't be alone, okay?

34:39.672 --> 34:40.889
You'd have a lot of help.

34:40.925 --> 34:43.342
I'm not worried about that.

34:43.377 --> 34:46.062
This would be Charlie's baby.
It would be a gift.

34:46.096 --> 34:48.231
I'm not ambivalent about this at all.

34:48.264 --> 34:50.216
Okay, so go pee.

34:55.105 --> 34:57.840
What are you doing in there?

35:09.336 --> 35:10.536
Alex?

35:20.631 --> 35:23.049
Did you take the test?

35:36.666 --> 35:39.184
Dr. Reid, could I talk to you, please?

35:39.219 --> 35:41.270
I'm busy doing my job.

35:41.304 --> 35:44.139
Well, you can give me two minutes.

35:44.174 --> 35:45.474
And why would I wanna do that?

35:45.508 --> 35:48.877
'Cause I am offering to make amends here.

35:48.912 --> 35:51.363
Amends. Really? How?

35:51.397 --> 35:54.199
I'm offering to... to...
to try again, you know?

35:54.234 --> 35:55.984
To be the messenger.

35:56.018 --> 35:57.319
Free of charge.

35:57.353 --> 35:58.854
You're unbelievable.

35:58.872 --> 36:02.457
He's walking around here.

36:04.077 --> 36:05.694
He's pining for you.

36:08.965 --> 36:12.084
Only a very lonely man would
prey on the vulnerabilities

36:12.135 --> 36:14.169
of another person the way you do,

36:14.203 --> 36:18.206
so I am trying not to
judge you too harshly.

36:18.224 --> 36:20.392
Good-bye.

36:23.062 --> 36:24.713
Ugh.

36:24.731 --> 36:27.482
Heather has agreed to
try a new medication...

36:27.517 --> 36:28.767
- Risperidone.
- Risperidone.

36:28.818 --> 36:31.687
- Risperidone.
- That's good.

36:31.721 --> 36:34.239
And we're gonna meet
weekly for talk therapy.

36:34.274 --> 36:36.241
We're gonna work on
coping with the content

36:36.276 --> 36:37.359
of your delusions.

36:37.393 --> 36:39.227
Every week, mondays at 3:00, right?

36:39.245 --> 36:40.779
Right.

36:40.830 --> 36:42.164
It's a good step.

36:43.750 --> 36:45.117
It's a good step.

36:45.168 --> 36:46.668
Can you stick with it, Heather?

36:46.703 --> 36:48.203
You need to stick with it.

36:48.237 --> 36:50.255
Yeah, I can do it. Even if I can't
change what I'm thinking,

36:50.290 --> 36:52.574
I can at least get more perspective.

36:54.260 --> 36:56.595
And then maybe I can get a job and...

36:56.629 --> 36:58.380
Her long-term goal is to move out.

36:58.414 --> 37:00.098
Yeah.

37:00.133 --> 37:01.767
I can cook you dinner for once.

37:03.970 --> 37:05.420
Thanks, Dr. Murphy.

37:06.606 --> 37:08.089
Yeah, thanks.

37:08.107 --> 37:09.257
I'll see you Monday, right, Heather?

37:09.275 --> 37:10.592
Monday. Monday.

37:10.610 --> 37:11.777
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:14.113 --> 37:15.647
I think we're out of coffee.

37:15.698 --> 37:17.733
- Are we?
- Yeah. I can stop and get some if you want.

37:17.767 --> 37:19.601
You're a bear without your coffee.

37:26.292 --> 37:28.160
Let me ask you something.

37:28.211 --> 37:29.778
What do women want?

37:29.796 --> 37:32.331
- I don't get the question.
- I mean, what is it with you people?

37:32.382 --> 37:34.499
I-I thought it was honesty,
so I try and give her honesty.

37:34.550 --> 37:37.135
And still, I'm coming
off like a total jerk.

37:37.170 --> 37:38.453
Well, honesty isn't everything.

37:38.471 --> 37:39.805
I assume we're talking about Maggie.

37:39.839 --> 37:42.474
- Yes.
- Well, <i>were</i> you a jerk?

37:42.508 --> 37:45.560
No. Absolutely not.

37:49.182 --> 37:51.566
All right, so maybe I was a bit of a jerk.

37:51.601 --> 37:52.185
Joel.

37:52.219 --> 37:54.018
I can't give her more
than I'm giving her, you know?

37:54.070 --> 37:55.520
I was trying to be honest about that.

37:55.571 --> 37:58.974
I'm just... I'm running blind here.

37:58.992 --> 38:00.659
Just a human male, you know?

38:01.995 --> 38:03.645
You're the most human male I know.

38:03.663 --> 38:06.665
All right, now you're
just messing with me.

38:06.699 --> 38:08.166
So how was your day?

38:09.752 --> 38:13.038
Mm. Well, I'm so desperate
to get Charlie back

38:13.089 --> 38:15.991
that I had a conversation
with him through a psychic.

38:16.009 --> 38:18.293
Ah. The great Randall.

38:18.327 --> 38:21.496
Yeah. He told me that, uh,

38:21.514 --> 38:25.500
Charlie got me this necklace
for my birthday, so...

38:25.518 --> 38:28.303
He probably just saw you
touch it and made a guess.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.774
Anyway, I'm an idiot. That's my day.

38:38.898 --> 38:40.565
You're not a jerk, Joel.

38:40.616 --> 38:42.668
But if you wanna be really honest,

38:42.702 --> 38:45.153
you can give a lot more
than you're admitting.

38:46.406 --> 38:48.023
You're just a chicken.

38:49.358 --> 38:51.693
I'll see you.

39:02.221 --> 39:03.755
I took the test.

39:05.758 --> 39:07.476
Got the results.

39:11.647 --> 39:14.466
I'm not pregnant.

39:24.811 --> 39:26.778
I'm just saying that you're...

39:26.829 --> 39:28.396
you're lucky 'cause you had brothers.

39:28.414 --> 39:29.865
Oh.

39:29.899 --> 39:32.334
You wouldn't be saying that
if you had seen the bruises

39:32.368 --> 39:33.618
I had as a kid.

39:33.669 --> 39:35.420
Yeah, but you had stories, you know?

39:35.455 --> 39:39.240
Like, what, that time Dougie
pushed you off the roof, right?

39:39.258 --> 39:42.961
- I jumped off the roof on a dare.
- See?

39:43.012 --> 39:45.097
Why don't you talk about
when you were a kid?

39:45.131 --> 39:46.765
Oh, gee, I don't know.
'Cause it wasn't fun?

39:46.799 --> 39:48.600
Well, I wanna know more about you

39:48.634 --> 39:52.270
than just the fun things
or the admirable things.

39:52.305 --> 39:55.440
Well, I say we go in the back room,

39:55.475 --> 39:58.593
and we roll the dice...

39:59.762 --> 40:02.564
and we make a kid.

40:02.598 --> 40:05.867
Okay. Wait. I'm all for going
in the other room, but...

40:05.902 --> 40:08.570
- Mm-hmm.
- We are not rolling any dice.

40:08.604 --> 40:10.038
Why not?

40:10.073 --> 40:11.606
We don't have time for a baby.

40:11.624 --> 40:12.941
With the hours I keep?

40:12.959 --> 40:15.961
Yeah, but you could take a year off and...

40:15.995 --> 40:19.447
- Uh...
- Come back.

40:19.465 --> 40:21.666
Like that ever happens.

40:23.052 --> 40:26.638
My career is really important
to me right now, Charlie.

40:26.672 --> 40:28.890
Okay.

40:28.925 --> 40:30.291
Okay.

40:30.309 --> 40:31.459
But I know you,

40:31.477 --> 40:34.513
and you're gonna change your mind someday.

40:34.564 --> 40:36.515
- Someday?
- Mm-hmm.

40:36.566 --> 40:39.460
And when you do,
you're gonna wanna have six kids.

40:39.460 --> 40:39.881
Oh?

40:39.881 --> 40:42.137
And you'll want to name
them all after me.

40:42.155 --> 40:46.074
Like, um... Charlie Jr.

40:46.109 --> 40:48.493
Chuck. Chas.

40:48.528 --> 40:50.812
Charlene.

40:50.830 --> 40:52.164
"Crazy"?

41:02.341 --> 41:04.543
There you are.

41:04.594 --> 41:06.795
Got you a coffee.

41:06.829 --> 41:08.630
Why?

41:08.664 --> 41:10.632
It's time for me to try
and be more generous.

41:10.666 --> 41:13.018
Well, then thank you. Oh, okay.

41:13.052 --> 41:17.689
It's time for me to try and be
more generous with <i>you.</i>

41:17.723 --> 41:20.559
Is that code for you wanna be exclusive?

41:20.610 --> 41:23.028
I think we should give a shot?

41:23.062 --> 41:25.814
Huh. And you're talking
boyfriend/girlfriend, right?

41:25.848 --> 41:26.865
Not-not coffee?

41:26.899 --> 41:28.733
Not coffee.

41:28.784 --> 41:31.153
Huh. I'm open to it.

41:31.187 --> 41:32.787
But I wanna hear you say "boyfriend"

41:32.822 --> 41:35.207
before I believe you.

41:35.241 --> 41:36.958
Boyfriend.

41:39.462 --> 41:44.199
I would very much like to
try and be your boyfriend.

41:44.217 --> 41:46.701
Hmm. Cheesy.

41:48.888 --> 41:55.677
(William Fitzsimmons' "beautiful girl" playing)

41:55.711 --> 41:59.314
<i>There's a difference between
pain and suffering.</i>

42:02.401 --> 42:04.052
<i>See, pain is in the body.</i>

42:11.277 --> 42:14.896
<i>Suffering is in the mind,</i>

42:14.914 --> 42:16.448
<i>and it feels infinite.</i>

42:24.173 --> 42:27.292
<i>So maybe the key is to
feel your pain...</i>

42:29.578 --> 42:31.012
<i>And learn from it.</i>

42:38.471 --> 42:39.888
<i>And someday...</i>

42:42.692 --> 42:45.560
Your suffering might disappear.
