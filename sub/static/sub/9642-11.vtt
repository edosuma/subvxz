00:06.950 --> 00:09.110
Okay. I've just finished suffling the deck

00:09.110 --> 00:11.140
and will now pick out the very card

00:11.180 --> 00:14.510
Justin chose moments ago, using only my...

00:14.550 --> 00:16.780
...magic, magic, magic!

00:19.290 --> 00:22.960
Boom! Is this your card?

00:22.990 --> 00:25.790
- No.
- OK, all right.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.330
- Boom! Is this your card?
- No.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.960
OK. All right, it's
gotta be here somewhere.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.330
Zeke, the card is still in my pocket.

00:34.370 --> 00:35.800
You never put it back into the deck.

00:35.840 --> 00:39.070
Right. Is this your card?

00:39.110 --> 00:41.640
- Yeah! Oh!
- Ah!

00:41.680 --> 00:45.380
So, it looks like Zeke has a new hobby.

00:45.410 --> 00:47.650
- Yep. - And it sounds
like you love it.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.980
Nope.

00:50.020 --> 00:51.680
And now, for my next trick...

00:53.190 --> 00:56.560
I'll need a volunteer
to lend me some money.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.660
Any size bill will do.

00:58.690 --> 01:01.330
All right, well, I got a five,

01:01.360 --> 01:03.300
- I have a 20...
- Twenty, OK, great.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.830
Zeke, I have smaller bills!

01:04.870 --> 01:06.430
Not to worry, Max.

01:06.470 --> 01:08.330
Because, before your very eyes,

01:08.370 --> 01:11.870
I'm gonna squeeze this bill
back together using only my...

01:11.910 --> 01:14.410
...magic, magic!

01:16.580 --> 01:20.180
Abraca...
Oh, it didn't work.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.320
Zeke, you know what I think you did wrong?

01:24.350 --> 01:26.650
You weren't squeezing hard enough.
Why don't you try it again?

01:26.690 --> 01:28.390
Oh, OK.

01:30.220 --> 01:33.260
- Alex, what are you doing?
- The same thing I always do.

01:33.290 --> 01:37.400
Entertaining myself when the
entertainment is not entertaining me.

01:37.430 --> 01:41.900
Oh, my gosh! There's a
baby duck in my hand!

01:44.370 --> 01:46.370
Where did this baby duck come from?

01:46.410 --> 01:50.040
Wow, that is a great trick, Zeke.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.150
Zeke, thank you so much for this duck.

01:55.180 --> 01:56.950
I can't wait to raise it and sell its milk.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.990
Justin, how did I do that?

02:03.020 --> 02:05.120
I don't know, but a good magician

02:05.160 --> 02:07.430
never reveals his secrets.

02:15.340 --> 02:17.440
Alex, you practically
exposed magic to Zeke.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.740
Do you know what that's gonna do
to us in the wizard competition?

02:19.770 --> 02:21.740
It wasn't that big of a deal.

02:21.780 --> 02:25.240
If he starts asking questions,
I am not covering for you.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.350
Well, I cover for you all the time.

02:28.380 --> 02:29.950
When people say you're uptight, I say,

02:29.980 --> 02:31.480
"Oh, you should try
living with him."

02:34.190 --> 02:35.860
Look, Alex, Justin's right.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.720
You always use magic
for your own amusement,

02:37.760 --> 02:40.030
and then we have to cover for you.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.760
But, did you see how happy Zeke was

02:41.800 --> 02:43.700
when he thought he pulled off that trick?

02:43.730 --> 02:46.000
I do wuv that wittle ducky.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.800
Oh, I'm gonna go make him a chicken outfit.

03:48.630 --> 03:50.260
Hey, Zeke.

03:50.300 --> 03:53.830
Listen, I've got a little
proposition for you.

03:53.870 --> 03:57.000
You ever considered a career
as a professional magician?

03:57.040 --> 04:00.670
'Cause I want to be in
the Zeke Beekerman business.

04:00.710 --> 04:03.380
Yeah, it's always been
a dream of mine, but...

04:05.850 --> 04:07.910
I've also wanted to be a masked wrestler.

04:07.950 --> 04:09.250
But that's never gonna happen.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.520
Well, let me tell ya, as a magician,

04:12.550 --> 04:14.050
you are a true talent.

04:14.090 --> 04:15.690
Now here's what

04:15.720 --> 04:17.890
I'm gonna be your manager.

04:17.930 --> 04:20.890
Do you have an awesome magician
name we can work off of?

04:20.930 --> 04:22.530
No, I don't.
I'm still trying

04:22.560 --> 04:24.300
to figure out how I did that trick.

04:24.330 --> 04:27.100
Zeke, your eyes are on the wrong thing.

04:27.130 --> 04:29.540
You gotta think big.
From now on,

04:29.570 --> 04:32.810
you're gonna be called
the Amazing Zeke-ini.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.280
That sounds
like "zucchini."

04:35.310 --> 04:39.380
I love it. Even better.
"The Amazing Zucchini."

04:39.410 --> 04:41.980
Do you see what I've already done for you?

04:42.020 --> 04:43.750
Something amazing's going on here.

04:44.950 --> 04:47.050
And I think I know what it is.

04:47.090 --> 04:49.620
Harper, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.470
All right.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.240
Don't freak out,

05:06.270 --> 05:08.680
but when I did that magic trick
with Max's money,

05:08.710 --> 05:10.310
everything is not what it seemed.

05:10.340 --> 05:11.710
What do you mean?

05:12.980 --> 05:15.010
Harper, do you believe in
the existence of wizards?

05:15.050 --> 05:17.680
- Wizards?
- Shh!

05:17.720 --> 05:19.950
Because, after what I saw
today, I know they exist.

05:19.990 --> 05:23.490
What?! No, that's crazy.
Alex is not a wizard!

05:23.520 --> 05:27.460
Of course Alex isn't a wizard.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.060
I am.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.970
Excuse me?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.500
How else could I have
conjured up that baby duck?

05:35.540 --> 05:38.170
I totally have magical wizard powers.

05:38.210 --> 05:40.510
Unless you have a better explanation.

05:40.540 --> 05:45.210
Um, uh... Maybe you were
making scrambled eggs,

05:45.250 --> 05:47.150
and you cracked one, and you didn't see

05:47.180 --> 05:48.680
that there was a baby duck inside it,

05:48.720 --> 05:51.920
and it got stuck
between your fingers, and...

05:53.290 --> 05:54.550
You're a wizard.

05:54.590 --> 05:58.090
Listen, don't tell anyone else about this.

05:58.130 --> 06:00.030
We don't know how the rest
of the world might react

06:00.060 --> 06:04.230
- to someone as powerful as me.
- Oh, I won't tell anybody.

06:04.270 --> 06:07.230
You're the best, Harper Finkle.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.570
Gosh, it finally feels so good

06:11.610 --> 06:14.040
to understand why I've
never fit in on this planet.

06:14.070 --> 06:16.210
Whoo! Yeah!

06:16.240 --> 06:19.180
I am not a normal person!

06:19.210 --> 06:22.250
Whoo! Maybe later.
Great! Whoo!

06:37.570 --> 06:39.100
Nice job, Alex.

06:39.130 --> 06:40.630
Thanks to you I had to lie to Zeke's face,

06:40.670 --> 06:41.940
'cause he thinks he's a wizard.

06:41.970 --> 06:43.900
Oh, my gosh.

06:43.940 --> 06:45.740
Could you imagine Zeke as a wizard?

06:45.770 --> 06:48.110
That'd be hilarious. "Oh no,
I messed up the spell.

06:48.140 --> 06:49.540
I turned my legs into licorice.

06:49.580 --> 06:53.410
There's another reason I
can't wear shorts!" Waa!

06:53.450 --> 06:55.950
Justin's right.
You took it too far this time.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.520
What is the big deal?

06:57.550 --> 06:59.750
The big deal is that
it's already bad enough

06:59.790 --> 07:01.250
that I have to keep a secret
from my boyfriend,

07:01.290 --> 07:03.190
but now I'm straight-up
lying to him, too?

07:03.220 --> 07:04.790
You have to tell him the truth, Alex.

07:04.830 --> 07:06.630
I can't tell him the truth, Harper.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.930
That would be exposing wizardry.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.900
- Well then, fine, I'll do it.
- You can't do that.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.430
That could get me kicked out of
the wizard competition for good.

07:13.470 --> 07:16.270
I know you're wizards,
and I'm keeping the secret.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.300
- Zeke will, too.
- How?

07:18.340 --> 07:20.470
Zeke says everything
that pops into his head.

07:20.510 --> 07:22.110
Have you heard the kid go down the stairs?

07:22.140 --> 07:26.080
Step, step,
step, step. Waa!

07:26.110 --> 07:29.420
That is only when there's no handrail.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.150
Harper, if you tell him the truth,

07:31.190 --> 07:32.450
that would be crossing the line.

07:32.490 --> 07:34.450
I don't think I could
ever forgive you for that.

07:34.490 --> 07:38.090
Look, just... Don't worry.

07:38.130 --> 07:40.030
- I'll handle it.
- Fine.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.330
Until then, I'll just keep
lying to the ones I love.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.830
Oh, hey, your hair looks
super good today, Alex.

07:45.870 --> 07:50.100
- Thank you.
- Oh, I lied again. Waa!

07:55.580 --> 07:57.310
Hey, Justin, what are you doing?

07:57.340 --> 07:59.350
- Just sweeping up.
- Yeah.

07:59.380 --> 08:02.450
I remember when I had to use
a broom to sweep stuff up.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.180
What are you talking about?

08:05.220 --> 08:07.150
Nothing, nothing.
Shouldn't have said anything.

08:07.190 --> 08:09.960
- OK.
- I wasn't going to tell you,

08:09.990 --> 08:11.960
but you're pulling it
out of me. OK.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.260
Remember when I did that magic trick today?

08:15.730 --> 08:17.830
That was real magic.

08:17.870 --> 08:21.730
I'm a... wizard.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.370
I'm sorry.
Did you say wizard?

08:26.410 --> 08:31.440
Keep it down, man!

08:31.480 --> 08:34.610
I know this may be hard for you
to process as a man of science,

08:34.650 --> 08:37.280
but yes, I am definitely a wizard.

08:37.320 --> 08:40.049
Sorry, Justin, looks like
I'm the cool one now.

08:40.090 --> 08:42.789
Zeke, I'm pretty sure wizards don't exist.

08:45.890 --> 08:49.200
Zeke, big news.
I got you your first gig.

08:49.230 --> 08:50.900
What do you think about
performing in Las Vegas?

08:50.930 --> 08:52.800
- I love it!
- Yeah?

08:52.830 --> 08:55.570
Well, maybe with some luck and a better
manager, you'll be there one day.

08:57.140 --> 08:59.370
But, for now, it's gonna be
a kid's birthday party.

08:59.410 --> 09:00.910
We're gonna do it right here
in the Sub Station.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.440
One second.
Go for Max.

09:07.310 --> 09:08.510
Can you believe that?

09:08.550 --> 09:10.680
A magic show with a real wizard.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.850
This is gonna be the greatest show ever.

09:12.890 --> 09:15.560
Excuse me for a minute, Zeke.
I gotta go talk to Alex.

09:15.590 --> 09:17.420
Hey, hey. Don't tell her
I'm a wizard.

09:17.460 --> 09:19.030
She seems like the kind of person

09:19.060 --> 09:20.890
who might take advantage of magic.

09:20.930 --> 09:23.760
Hey, that's my sister you're talking about.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.200
And you are absolutely right.

09:27.330 --> 09:29.600
Have you seen the cover
to the tomato sauce?

09:29.640 --> 09:31.900
Oh, so you want me to cover for you again?

09:31.940 --> 09:33.770
Guess what, Alex?

09:33.810 --> 09:36.840
Zeke is gonna do a magic show
in front of a bunch of people.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.450
Oh, he's terrible. So that
means it's gonna be hilarious.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.720
I know he's terrible,
you know he's terrible.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.720
But Zeke?
He doesn't know he's terrible.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.590
He thinks he's a wizard.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.520
- Oh, so he told you, too?
- Mm-hmm.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.590
Oh, but don't worry about it, Justin,

09:52.630 --> 09:54.430
because Alex says she's gonna handle it.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.030
- Ooh!
- I am, OK?

09:56.060 --> 09:58.100
I totally have a plan to fix this.

09:58.130 --> 09:59.800
Great. What is it?

09:59.830 --> 10:02.240
Are you ready, because
you're gonna love this.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.810
You are stalling.
She's stalling.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.980
I am gonna wait for Zeke to realize

10:12.010 --> 10:14.280
that he's not a wizard
when his magic act fails.

10:14.310 --> 10:15.880
And it'll be hilarious for all of us.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.550
Yeah, that should work.
It's pretty good.

10:18.590 --> 10:22.320
Wait, so your plan is to let my boyfriend

10:22.360 --> 10:25.020
humiliate himself?
I can't let that happen.

10:27.800 --> 10:31.030
Zeke, honey, are you sure
you want to do a magic show?

10:31.070 --> 10:32.500
It may not turn out like you think.

10:32.530 --> 10:35.800
Of course I want to do it.
I'm great at magic.

10:35.840 --> 10:39.440
It's almost as if I were a real wizard.

10:41.710 --> 10:44.280
I think I'm with Harper on this one, Zeke.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.680
I, uh... I don't think you
should go through with it.

10:46.710 --> 10:49.780
What? Why aren't you guys
supporting me on this?

10:49.820 --> 10:51.950
I mean, I understand Justin.
I'm just cooler than you.

10:51.990 --> 10:54.090
But, Harper, you're my girlfriend.

10:54.120 --> 10:58.590
I know. I just... I don't
think it's a good idea.

10:58.630 --> 11:00.690
I finally find my true calling,

11:00.730 --> 11:02.860
and you guys are trying
to talk me out of it?

11:02.900 --> 11:05.260
I don't get it. I thought we had
a better relationship than this.

11:05.300 --> 11:08.170
This isn't about our relationship, Zeke.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.640
Well, then, what's it about?

11:12.870 --> 11:14.370
I can't tell you.

11:14.410 --> 11:15.840
You're keeping secrets from me?

11:15.880 --> 11:17.510
- We don't do that.
- I know we don't.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.450
- So tell me.
- I can't.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.980
Well, if you can't tell me,
Harper Finkle, then...

11:22.020 --> 11:25.250
I have to break up with you.

11:30.760 --> 11:33.990
I hope you're happy, Alex.
I kept your secret.

11:38.370 --> 11:40.770
Is this as hilarious
as you thought it'd be?

11:52.930 --> 11:54.600
Harper.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.270
Have you been up all night knitting this?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.470
I'm not talking to you!

12:00.900 --> 12:03.640
Harper, I didn't think Zeke
would break up with you.

12:15.290 --> 12:19.220
I feel so bad. Look, I'm
gonna take care of this.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.130
- Bad!
- What?

12:26.160 --> 12:30.200
That's what you said
before, and look what happened.

12:30.230 --> 12:31.900
Stop taking care of it!

12:38.940 --> 12:41.680
Hello, everybody.
Thank you for coming today.

12:41.710 --> 12:44.610
I'd like to wish a very happy
birthday to little Mickey Scudamore.

12:47.980 --> 12:52.590
And now, I present to you,
the Amazing Zucchini!

12:55.760 --> 12:57.290
Zeke, get out of the trunk!

12:58.830 --> 13:00.300
Uh...

13:04.970 --> 13:09.370
Sorry, the Amazing Zucchini
was in the bathroom.

13:09.410 --> 13:10.670
You started early.

13:10.710 --> 13:12.840
The Amazing Zucchini, everybody!

13:18.580 --> 13:20.120
Thank you. Thank you.

13:20.150 --> 13:24.750
Tonight, you will see
an amazing world of magic.

13:24.790 --> 13:27.360
- Magic, magic.
- Magic, magic, magic.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.620
All right!

13:28.660 --> 13:30.330
Justin, have you seen Harper?

13:30.360 --> 13:32.530
She's upstairs bawling her eyes out.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.200
I really messed up this time.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.700
You think?

13:35.730 --> 13:37.600
Thanks for telling me.
I had no clue.

13:37.630 --> 13:40.300
We need to do something.

13:41.610 --> 13:43.710
I think that we should tell Zeke the truth.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.440
Alex, we cannot tell Zeke.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.040
That'd be breaking
the number one wizard rule.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.580
I know, I know.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.110
And there's a reason
that Max is in the lead.

13:50.150 --> 13:51.650
- We cannot tell Zeke.
- You're right.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.980
That's why we are so far behind...

13:53.020 --> 13:54.980
OK, I get it!

13:55.020 --> 13:56.450
Great, Mickey!

13:57.950 --> 14:00.790
Hey! That guy
just tore up my money.

14:00.820 --> 14:04.130
That 20's coming off of the bill.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.660
Not to worry. I am
the Amazing Zucchini.

14:07.700 --> 14:11.030
And I'm his assistant, Pickle.

14:11.070 --> 14:14.040
- We didn't discuss this.
- You're right, you're right.

14:14.870 --> 14:16.410
The Amazing Pickle.

14:16.440 --> 14:21.110
Hey, Zeke? I have
something to tell you.

14:21.140 --> 14:23.010
- Gosh, she's gonna tell him.
- We have to do something.

14:23.050 --> 14:24.510
Zeke, listen, there's something...

14:24.550 --> 14:26.620
I'm busy, Harper.
Get out of here.

14:29.650 --> 14:32.590
Whoa, what a trick, huh, folks?

14:32.620 --> 14:35.120
Zucchini and Pickle are incredible!

14:37.330 --> 14:42.830
That's right. I did it.
It's coming from my hands.

14:42.870 --> 14:46.270
That's where the power is!
All right!

14:46.300 --> 14:49.470
Yeah! Whoo!

14:51.880 --> 14:54.410
How did... Alex!

14:56.880 --> 14:58.310
Hi, Gordon.

15:01.020 --> 15:02.320
See you in P.E.!

15:03.450 --> 15:05.320
And now, the Amazing Zucchini

15:05.360 --> 15:07.490
will perform his greatest trick.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.360
I'm gonna saw Pickle in half!

15:10.390 --> 15:12.560
- Oh, no.
- The saw is real.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.230
Zeke, this one is too dangerous.
Put the saw down.

15:17.270 --> 15:19.570
Aw, come on. This is
his greatest trick.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.410
It's fine, Justin.
I got this.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.740
Guys, calm down.
It's all an illusion.

15:25.780 --> 15:27.040
He's a great magician.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.210
No, he's not.
The saw is real.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.380
I used magic to fake
Zeke's trick yesterday.

15:31.410 --> 15:33.580
Now he thinks he's a wizard
with magical powers.

15:35.290 --> 15:36.350
Then get me out of this thing

15:36.390 --> 15:38.020
before that caped freak saws me in two!

15:38.050 --> 15:41.420
Saw him, saw him!

15:43.160 --> 15:45.460
You still don't want to use magic?

15:48.700 --> 15:51.830
Chancy meat, schmancy treat,
fancy feet is now complete.

15:54.600 --> 15:58.110
I cut him in half without using the saw.

16:06.180 --> 16:07.980
Aw, somebody catch my feet!

16:08.020 --> 16:10.350
Whoa, I've never seen this before.

16:10.390 --> 16:11.390
Good one!

16:11.420 --> 16:12.790
Don't worry, I'll get it.

16:19.860 --> 16:22.560
I can't believe you
flashed me back to school.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.370
You were going to tell Zeke.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.270
What kind of a friend are you?

16:26.300 --> 16:28.900
Look, Harper, I want to
tell Zeke too, but I can't!

16:28.940 --> 16:30.870
We can't. You're just
gonna have to accept that!

16:30.910 --> 16:33.380
I can't accept that because
it's ruining my life!

16:33.410 --> 16:35.480
Everybody, calm down.

16:35.510 --> 16:40.280
Stop! Oh, no!
I'm out of control.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.190
I've frozen the entire world forever.

16:43.220 --> 16:45.090
I feel so alone.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.320
Zeke.

16:46.360 --> 16:50.130
You're not frozen?
I am losing my mind!

16:50.160 --> 16:52.290
Zeke, listen to me, OK?

16:52.330 --> 16:55.300
You are not a wizard.
I am.

16:55.330 --> 16:58.000
This is no time for jokes, Justin.

16:58.030 --> 16:59.640
I froze the entire world!

16:59.670 --> 17:01.640
Oh, what kind of monster am I?!

17:01.670 --> 17:05.109
Zeke, you did not do
any of this, OK? I did.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.640
I am a wizard.

17:09.510 --> 17:13.750
- I even have a wand.
- This cheap-looking stick

17:13.780 --> 17:15.349
that's always sticking
out of your back pocket?

17:15.390 --> 17:17.390
Justin, why are you lying to me?

17:17.420 --> 17:20.460
- I'm the real wizard.
- Really?

17:20.490 --> 17:23.460
Yeah, I'm the one who made
the baby duck appear,

17:23.490 --> 17:26.329
I'm the one who made my
ex-girlfriend disappear,

17:26.359 --> 17:29.970
and if you hadn't noticed,
everyone is frozen.

17:33.100 --> 17:36.040
Where are we?!
What just happened?

17:36.070 --> 17:37.970
Zeke, Zeke, calm down.

17:38.010 --> 17:40.440
Why is this window all lopsided?

17:40.480 --> 17:44.150
You have a closet of fog!

17:44.180 --> 17:45.750
Calm down!

17:45.780 --> 17:47.680
And gargoyles wearing sunglasses, man!

17:47.720 --> 17:49.220
And what is going on?!

17:49.250 --> 17:52.190
Zeke...

17:53.890 --> 17:56.360
Oh, my gosh.

17:56.390 --> 17:59.030
- You're a wizard.
- Yes.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.060
Don't hurt me, wizard freak.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.900
Zeke, no one is gonna hurt you, OK?

18:03.930 --> 18:06.670
I am here for you.
I am still your best friend.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.970
- Really?
- Yes.

18:09.010 --> 18:14.140
Oh...
It all makes sense now.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.280
That's why you and Alex showed up

18:16.310 --> 18:18.910
in <i>Night of the Halloween</i>
<i>Sorority Party Disaster 2,</i>

18:18.950 --> 18:22.780
when you weren't even in <i>Night of the
Halloween</i> <i>Sorority Party Disaster 1!</i>

18:24.590 --> 18:26.990
And that's why I saw
that dog turn into a werewolf.

18:27.020 --> 18:29.530
It was Mason! Whoa!

18:29.560 --> 18:32.830
- OK, let's take a seat.
- Oh! Whoa!

18:32.860 --> 18:36.570
Let's let it all
settle in. OK.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.070
Now that you know, you cannot tell anyone.

18:39.100 --> 18:42.200
Alex and Max are also wizards.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.610
The only other people who know
are my parents and Harper.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.840
- Harper?
- Mm-hmm.

18:46.880 --> 18:50.750
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, what have I done?

18:50.780 --> 18:53.150
That's the only reason she
didn't want me to do magic.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.980
She didn't want me
to make a fool of myself.

18:55.020 --> 18:57.620
Oh. I should have never
broken up with her.

18:57.650 --> 19:02.820
- You should tell her that.
- You're right. I will.

19:02.860 --> 19:04.560
How far are we from the sub shop?

19:04.590 --> 19:08.430
I don't have any cab fare either, so...

19:08.460 --> 19:11.830
We're, uh...
closer than you think.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.140
Man, your weird magic laboratory

19:22.180 --> 19:24.450
really is in your vegetable cooler.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.780
Man, I should have known.

19:25.820 --> 19:27.620
Your family spends a lot of time in there.

19:31.220 --> 19:32.920
I think it's time to get
this party re-started.

19:32.960 --> 19:33.920
You OK?

19:33.960 --> 19:37.090
OK? This is the
best day of my life.

19:37.130 --> 19:39.800
Gosh, I just learned
my best friend is a wizard.

19:39.830 --> 19:43.330
- Let's do it, Justini!
- Don't call me that.

19:43.370 --> 19:46.770
Let's move this party along.
Time to cut the cake.

19:49.010 --> 19:51.470
You just made that cake
appear out of nowhere!

19:51.510 --> 19:53.180
Is it chocolate?

19:53.210 --> 19:56.750
- Now it is.
- Oh, ho! Sweet.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.510
All right. Tick tock.
Time was stopped.

19:59.550 --> 20:01.850
Bang the gong.
Time moves on.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.050
Hey, everybody!
Who's ready for some cake?

20:05.090 --> 20:07.520
Right over there.

20:09.260 --> 20:10.830
Hey, legs.

20:10.860 --> 20:14.030
Get us a corner piece
with lots of frosting. Go.

20:15.930 --> 20:17.970
I'm not gonna argue with you anymore, OK?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.840
Justin will not let me, let you
tell Zeke that we're wizards.

20:20.870 --> 20:22.500
I just told Zeke we're wizards.

20:22.540 --> 20:23.810
What?!

20:23.840 --> 20:27.040
The secret was coming
in-between everyone.

20:27.080 --> 20:31.080
I made the decision, I will
accept the consequences.

20:32.420 --> 20:37.520
Don't worry, I will never
tell anyone, I swear.

20:37.550 --> 20:39.120
You better swear, because if you do,

20:39.160 --> 20:42.220
you will live the rest of your
life in our closet of fog.

20:44.390 --> 20:47.400
We have a closet of fog?
I want to see that.

20:47.430 --> 20:52.670
Harper, I am so sorry I was
such a jerk to you before.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.170
I guess all that fake magic power

20:55.200 --> 20:57.370
really went to my head.

20:57.410 --> 20:59.910
I hope you'll take me back.

20:59.940 --> 21:02.240
Of course I'll take you back, Zeke.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.110
I missed you so much.
Come here.

21:06.580 --> 21:09.720
Can I just apologize, too, Harper?

21:09.750 --> 21:11.950
- You don't need to.
- Yes, I do.

21:11.990 --> 21:13.790
I was careless with magic,

21:13.820 --> 21:15.790
and I put you in a really tough spot.

21:15.830 --> 21:18.030
- And I'm sorry.
- And I'm sorry I said

21:18.060 --> 21:19.930
I don't care about the wizard competition.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.100
I do.

21:21.130 --> 21:23.330
There's a wizard competition?

21:23.370 --> 21:25.770
OK, OK. Who do you guys
think would win in a brawl?

21:25.800 --> 21:29.200
Wizards, aliens, or sharks with
lasers attached to their heads?

21:29.240 --> 21:31.770
Oh, do you guys need
batteries for your wands,

21:31.810 --> 21:33.610
or you just like zap it
and it comes to life,

21:33.640 --> 21:36.280
and you're just like,
"Give me my wand!" Ha, ha!

21:36.310 --> 21:37.610
This is no longer cute,
put his voice on mute.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.720
Thank you.

21:51.580 --> 21:54.650
What's this
pen-like thing do?

21:54.680 --> 21:57.380
It's a pen. It writes.

21:57.420 --> 21:59.820
Awesome!

21:59.850 --> 22:04.320
I've never seen anything
like these desks before.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.360
Yes, you have.
I got them at the Desk Barn.

22:06.390 --> 22:08.060
You were there.
You picked them out.

22:08.090 --> 22:10.360
Magical knickknacks!

22:10.400 --> 22:13.230
Yes!

22:13.270 --> 22:15.230
Maybe we should ease Zeke into the magic.

22:15.270 --> 22:17.700
He still has a hard time
with the ordinary things.

22:17.740 --> 22:20.540
What?!
A magical comfy chair!

22:20.570 --> 22:23.340
Oh, let me try it,
let me try it, let me try it.

22:23.380 --> 22:26.310
Oh, my gosh.
It really is magical.

22:26.340 --> 22:28.550
It's... It's comfy!

22:29.720 --> 22:31.450
What?!
