00:32.575 --> 00:35.237
Take it down the street for a while.
You're working my last nerve.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.111

Saw the picture in the paper.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.867
Yes, the line goin' back was around the block.

Fuck me, no way.
He's not serious.

07:05.301 --> 07:07.087
Yes, he is. And the best part is...

07:07.219 --> 07:08.834
we got no fucking lobster.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.383
He's gotta send that kid
to fucking Chinatown to get some.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.846
Twelve one—and—a—half pounders.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.886
— Get me a receipt, and hurry the fuck up.
— Right away, Chef.

No sleepers. Make sure they're happy.
I want peppy lobsters.

Menu change.

07:20.524 --> 07:25.518
We're doing butter—poached lobster
with roasted corn coulis...

07:25.654 --> 07:28.111
and something to be determined later.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.446
Right now, Entremetier!

07:29.575 --> 07:31.907
— Roast me some fucking corn!
— Yes, Chef.

07:32.036 --> 07:36.029
Oh my God, he gives that to us,
I'm gonna go in the walk—in and cry. Fuck.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.907
Degustation's got what?
We have... (Sighs)

07:39.043 --> 07:42.535
..the razor clams, the salmon, the cod.
Now he's gonna squeeze in fucking lobster?

07:42.671 --> 07:45.083
Why not just shove
a goddamn pineapple up my ass?

07:45.215 --> 07:47.080
He's giving it to the saucier.

07:47.217 --> 07:50.425
The chefs been looking at her funny all night.
You know the look?

07:50.554 --> 07:53.216
Yeah, I've seen it.
In my fucking nightmares I've seen it.

07:53.349 --> 07:55.089
That's why I try not to look at the guy.

07:55.225 --> 07:58.717
Never directly, right?
'Cause the eyes is like his way in.

07:58.854 --> 08:02.187
That's how he gets you.
That's how he gets inside — he looks at you.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.307
Then he crawls up in your brain...

08:04.443 --> 08:06.525
takes a big dump on it...

08:06.654 --> 08:08.144
and then he's got you.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.943
— "Avoid the eyes" is what you're saying.
— Yeah, avoid the fucking eyes.

08:12.076 --> 08:15.614
(Chef) Madame le saucier!
(Man) It's looking good, it's looking great.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.078

You'll be doing the lobster course.
Get your station ready.

08:21.377 --> 08:22.492
Absolutely, Chef.

08:22.628 --> 08:25.540
Coming down the line! Behind.

08:26.965 --> 08:30.674
(Man) Can you take that off the heat for me?
(Man 2) Right away, Chef.

09:45.586 --> 09:48.248
(Lead singer) Yes, indeed.
(Man) All right!

09:48.380 --> 09:51.543
Back home it was All Saints' Day.
Y'all might not know that.

09:51.675 --> 09:54.917
— They do All Saints' Day here in Connecticut?
— (Man) Whoo!

09:55.053 --> 09:56.463
How about All Souls' Day?

09:57.389 --> 09:59.095
Don't know it, huh?

09:59.224 --> 10:01.180
Well, in New Orleans
it's a pretty big deal,

10:01.310 --> 10:04.097
so we're gonna do this song
right here for you, all right?

10:06.064 --> 10:08.100
J‘ Carved in stone

10:09.109 --> 10:10.565
J‘ Is a name

10:10.694 --> 10:13.231
J‘ I will remember

10:14.948 --> 10:16.484
Yeah, baby.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.983
J‘ Skin and bone

10:19.119 --> 10:20.655
J‘ And the heart

10:20.788 --> 10:23.780
J‘ That was so tender... J‘

Sofia B. Real here from New Orleans.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.501
Y'all may have forgotten about us,
but we're still here.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.875
Can we talk about the so—called recovery?

10:36.011 --> 10:38.593
lt sucks...the big one.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.384
Fourteen months,
and it ought to be getting better here.

10:41.517 --> 10:44.008
Fourteen months,
and it ought to be getting easier.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.726
It ought to be getting fixed. You feel me?

10:46.855 --> 10:48.561
Well, it isn't.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.430
It gets harder every day.

10:51.527 --> 10:55.236
There's still 100,000 empty houses
in New Orleans, at least.

10:55.364 --> 10:57.730
100,000 families that can't get home.

10:57.866 --> 11:01.609
Everyone in this frickin' city
is on painkillers or booze.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.989
No kidding,
85% of the city is doped just to cope.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.786
And you need an AK—47 to go out at night.

11:08.919 --> 11:13.162
And the frickin' National Guard
is patrolling our streets like...

11:13.298 --> 11:15.550
we're Fallujah or something.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.254
So you know what?

11:19.304 --> 11:22.137
Drop and give me 50, you fucking fucks.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.593
(Turns up radio)

11:32.776 --> 11:34.107
(Turns down music)

11:34.236 --> 11:39.572
That was 10th Ward Buck with his timeless
standard, the evergreen Drop & Gimme 50.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.659
Oh, must be time
for the OZ Live Music Calendar.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.118
I'll be right back.

11:46.582 --> 11:48.447
— Davis.
— Darnell.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.996
— I thought you left hours ago.
— I heard the show and came back.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.709
— Mix it up a little, will you?
— Absolutely.

11:52.838 --> 11:55.329
- I'm serious.
— So am |. Look at my face.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.091
I got Gin In My System.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.961
I thought that was a Coke!
And don't spill it in the control board.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.088
— You will pay for this one.
— Empty threat.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.341
Then you'd have me around
for the next 20 years, working it off.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.638
I got Gin In My System on deck.

12:10.689 --> 12:13.681
Big Freedia. A little tranny bounce
as a change of pace.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.603
That's not what I mean by mixing it up.

12:15.736 --> 12:19.024
Brass band, funk, trad jazz, rock 'n' roll...

12:19.156 --> 12:20.646
- I don't care.
— Oh! I feel you.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.740
How about a little acoustic Piedmont blues
from Bumble Bee Slim?

12:23.869 --> 12:25.905
A little lullaby
to put our audience to sleep?

12:26.038 --> 12:29.280
You know what?
I don't even mind you playing a little...bounce.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.532
Once in a while. Just not nonstop.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.250
Mix it up, Davis.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.924
(Sighs)

12:40.844 --> 12:43.836
So go out and see some live local music.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.054
Oh, and bring your gun.

12:46.183 --> 12:49.846
Uh, this one goes out to someone who,
at the moment,

12:49.978 --> 12:53.186
is very much on my mind.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.898
J‘ Carry on

12:58.111 --> 13:00.227
J‘ Have yourself

13:00.364 --> 13:02.946
J‘ A lovely ride

13:05.077 --> 13:07.033
J‘ Think of me

13:07.829 --> 13:10.286
J‘ When you finally

13:10.415 --> 13:12.872
J‘ Reach the other side

13:22.594 --> 13:24.050
(Woman) Yeah!

13:55.460 --> 13:56.666
(Cheering and applause)

13:56.795 --> 13:58.501
J‘ Hold on tight

13:59.631 --> 14:01.371
J‘ To the things

14:02.259 --> 14:04.841
J‘ You always taught us... J‘

14:06.847 --> 14:07.802
(J‘ Hip—hop)

14:07.931 --> 14:09.887
— (Man) It's more of a white thing.
— You think?

14:10.017 --> 14:12.429
Dressing up and shit? Oh, yeah.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.810
— They got Halloween in Holland, right?
- No.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.520
They don't? Shit.

14:18.442 --> 14:19.557
They got Mardi Gras though?

14:19.693 --> 14:20.853
- 7 and 7?
— Yeah, man.

14:20.986 --> 14:24.319
- That's a Catholic thing.
— So what, y'all ain't Catholic?

14:24.448 --> 14:26.609
Not so much. We got Queen's Day.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.448
Everybody wears orange.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.784
Sounds like Hallo—fucking—ween to me.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.783
(Gunshots, people screaming)

14:39.463 --> 14:40.748
(Woman groans)

14:43.592 --> 14:46.334
— (Woman groans)
— (Tires screech)

14:48.722 --> 14:51.134
Five.
We expect the four wounded to recover.

14:51.266 --> 14:55.009
Sorry to disappoint you —
I know "five dead" would make a better story.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.101
This is all off—the—record, right?

14:57.230 --> 15:00.893
You want an official statement,
you need to call the PIO.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.357
Leads?

15:05.030 --> 15:06.440
No, no leads.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.573
One or two.
We're still sorting that out.

15:11.286 --> 15:14.403
No, things were worse last spring
and this summer.

15:14.539 --> 15:17.281
I'm sure it is having an impact on tourism.

15:18.543 --> 15:23.082
That piece of mayhem didn't have anything
to do with Katrina. He was a vet. Iraq.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.254
Listen...
Listen, | read the note.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.091
I went to the scene.

15:29.221 --> 15:31.428
Stuff like that can happen anywhere.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.097
The stove and the refrigerator.

15:35.227 --> 15:39.561
Yeah, but he didn't eat her.
Not like that guy in the East Village years ago.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.225
Uh—huh, look it up.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.519
You'll mention that in your article?

15:44.486 --> 15:46.272
You're welcome.

15:46.404 --> 15:51.114
Jesus. New York Times. I think they live
for the latest grotesquerie from New Orleans.

15:51.243 --> 15:54.030
They just love them some Zack and Addie.
What've you got?

15:54.162 --> 15:57.199
Couple of knuckleheads walk in a club,
see another couple of knuckleheads,

15:57.332 --> 16:00.540
— go to the car, get their guns.
— Bring their neighborhood shit down here.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.625
My phone's ringing off the fucking hook.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.837
Shooting in the Quarter
gets everybody's attention.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.126
Got mine.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.502
Good to go.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.469
— How's business?
— Booming.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.759
— Really?
— More work than we can handle.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.974
Impressive.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.309
(Distant sirens wailing)

16:25.861 --> 16:27.101
(Man) Yeah, so...

16:27.237 --> 16:28.522
So I guess I'll...

16:30.073 --> 16:31.734
I'll see you around?

16:31.867 --> 16:32.982
(Chuckles) Who knows?

16:33.118 --> 16:35.404
— (Janette) Have a good one, OK?
— OK.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.369
— Bye.
— Bye.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.908
(Neighbors yelling)

16:43.378 --> 16:45.084
Go ahead. You can say it.

16:45.797 --> 16:49.836
Hey, no comment implied or intended.
Far from it for l to be judgmental and shit.

16:49.968 --> 16:53.131
— Oh, really? So what?
— I don't know.

16:53.263 --> 16:56.426
You know. First rule, right?

16:57.350 --> 17:00.808
- Don't fuck the floor.
— Hey, he's not my floor.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.552
That's not my restaurant.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.263
I got takeout on the way home.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.394
Is that OK?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.563
My apologies for ever doubting you.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.696
- Wake and bake?
— I gotta go to work.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.031
I guess you kinda need your brain
where you work.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.527
— "Stay alert, stay alive" kind of a thing.
— You guys work stoned where you are?

17:18.663 --> 17:21.370
No, not really.
It's just we don't have to be in till two.

17:24.753 --> 17:25.993
(Coughs)

17:26.129 --> 17:30.122
Oh, man! lwould not want
to be fucked—up at all around Brulard.

17:30.258 --> 17:33.295
Yeah, that dude senses fear —
or at least that's what I hear.

17:33.428 --> 17:36.215
And then he fucks with you
just to prove that he can fuck with you,

17:36.348 --> 17:38.179
because he likes it.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.798
Because he loves it.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.766
— Good cook though, right?
- Oh, he's a great cook.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.726
- Mm.
— Right?

17:45.148 --> 17:48.015
(Car horns honking, people chattering)

17:48.610 --> 17:51.147
(Man) I'm on Carroll Street now.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.656
(Man) Yeah. All right.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.700
(Quiet chatter)

18:12.008 --> 18:13.873
(Man) Do the count.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.125
Hey.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.507
— Hey.
— Hey.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.803
So are we good?

18:21.935 --> 18:23.471
Yeah, we're good.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.103
— Come again.
— Thanks, man.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.063
Tell your friends, will you?

18:30.068 --> 18:31.933
What the fuck was that?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.776
He's cool. We know him.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.861
Yeah, still.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.906
Need an eye opener?

18:40.078 --> 18:41.784
— (Hammers banging)
— Hey, Riley!

18:41.913 --> 18:46.327
— Meet my cousin Nelson, in from Dallas.
- (Men chatting in Spanish)

18:51.047 --> 18:52.958
- Thad Riley.
— Nelson Hidalgo.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.252
You? Related to him?

18:55.385 --> 18:56.750
Oh, by marriage.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.296
(Speaks Spanish)

18:59.973 --> 19:01.929
(Riley and Hidalgo laugh)

19:02.058 --> 19:05.471
Your Spanish is terrible, cuz.
I can't understand a word.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.856
— How long are you here for?
— I'll see how it goes.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.518
Welcome to New Orleans.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.356
I'm liking it so far.

19:16.906 --> 19:20.319
(Car approaches, stops)

19:29.669 --> 19:32.081
Jesus Christ, Albert.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.377
'Fuck's my sign?

19:40.138 --> 19:41.969
(Distant dog barking)

19:43.850 --> 19:45.260
(Sighs)

20:05.914 --> 20:07.950
I can see why your mama
couldn't bear coming back.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.119
Once was all she could handle.

20:11.252 --> 20:14.335
Looka here.
Mama musta put 'em up there and forgot 'em.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.588
Kinda wrinkly.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.584
Oh, they didn't take no water.

20:21.471 --> 20:24.338
Not bad for being in this house
for more than a year.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.010
Phew!

20:27.060 --> 20:29.927
(Antoine)
I guess your mama doing the right thing.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.224
(Desiree) At least she'll get something for it.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.143
(Antoine) Seems a shame though.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.561
You grew up in this house.
She grew up in this house.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.481
What little we get from Road Home...
Can't fix it. Can't afford to.

20:39.614 --> 20:43.232
Hm. I guess.
How soon will she get the money?

20:43.368 --> 20:46.280
They're saying four to six weeks after you file,
they tell you how much.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.621
— I gotta get through the paperwork first.
— You're good at that though.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.990
— They want a deed.
- Oh, shit.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.785
Don't know how the fuck
I'm gonna get around that.

20:55.922 --> 20:59.335
Grandma got it from her Aunt Celeste,
whose daddy built it himself,

20:59.467 --> 21:01.549
who won the land playing bid whist.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.339
It's just always been in our family.

21:03.471 --> 21:06.383
— We taking the bus or you gonna call a cab?
- (Tuts)

21:07.559 --> 21:10.266
I ain't walking all the way over
to no Saint Claude to wait on no bus.

21:10.395 --> 21:14.513
- I'm calling. I'm calling.
— You need to get a job—job, Antoine.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.607
Listen, I know, I know. Ajob—job.

21:17.735 --> 21:21.023
Maybe we could move
into the Musicians' Village.

21:21.156 --> 21:24.444
You really want to move all the
way down here in the ninth ward?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.276
Maybe. It's closer for you though.

21:28.413 --> 21:30.449
We'd have to qualify for a mortgage.

21:30.582 --> 21:32.914
Might have to get married.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.788
— Shit.
— Shit, too.

21:37.839 --> 21:41.377
Oh, here it is.
We're always suing the city.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.795
I am anyhow — one thing or another.

21:43.928 --> 21:48.592
So, after the shootings
at the big second line on MLK Weekend...

21:48.725 --> 21:53.435
Uh... I'm sorry.
Shootings, MLK Weekend, second line.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.474
When did you get to town?

21:56.357 --> 21:59.315
— September, right after Labor Day.
— And you still haven't been to a second line?

21:59.444 --> 22:02.402
— You could have stayed in California.
- I've been meaning to...

22:02.530 --> 22:03.906
We're gonna rectify that.

22:04.032 --> 22:07.069
This Sunday. Sudan with New Birth.
We're going.

22:07.202 --> 22:09.864
Sounds good. Um...
So these shootings?

22:09.996 --> 22:16.242
Well, if there's any violence at all after the
second line, NOPD always blames the clubs.

22:16.377 --> 22:20.040
So after MLK —
which is the same weekend —

22:20.173 --> 22:22.505
Nagin plays the "chocolate city" race card,

22:22.634 --> 22:25.501
Rileyjacks up the fees, like, 300%...

22:25.637 --> 22:28.219
I mean, talk about your mixed message.

22:28.348 --> 22:31.681
He says he needs to pay
for overtime police protection

22:31.809 --> 22:34.551
with two hours before and two hours after.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.894
- Is that new?
— Unprecedented.

22:37.023 --> 22:40.732
Next thing you know, they'll be trying
to make the Indians have permits.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.352
And then there will be blood in the streets.

22:44.489 --> 22:47.981
— So you're suing the city to roll back the fees.
— It's a huge thing.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.403
It's about sustaining the culture.

22:50.537 --> 22:53.700
The city's always at war with the Indians,
musicians, second-liners,

22:53.831 --> 22:58.074
— about noise, curfew, permits. It's, um...
- Makes no sense.

22:58.211 --> 23:01.829
Yeah, they just don't get it. You'd think
we came so close to losing everything

23:01.965 --> 23:05.173
that they'd appreciate what we have,
butno.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.758
So, um, there's that.

23:07.887 --> 23:12.221
And I am also representing one of the families
in the Danziger Bridge thing.

23:12.350 --> 23:14.386
Find the file, read it.

23:14.519 --> 23:16.885
I'll get up to speed, I promise.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.728
Er... What is going on at home...

23:19.857 --> 23:23.315
with Sofia, at school,
new house, old house...

23:24.070 --> 23:28.609
I won't bore you with the details, but I'm
not taking on anything else for the time being.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.322
— Got it?
— Got it.

23:30.451 --> 23:33.739
— So you say you're always suing the city?
— Oh, one thing or another.

23:33.871 --> 23:37.739
I'm late for court,
but remind me to tell you my Harry Lee story.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.285
(J‘ Jazz)

24:28.593 --> 24:31.756
- Hey, dig the new record, man.
— I appreciate it, brother. Thank you.

24:31.888 --> 24:35.176
I agree. Really fonNard—thinking,
great writing, execution.

24:35.308 --> 24:37.264
- Cool.
— What I been telling you, Del?

24:37.393 --> 24:40.851
— Well, she got to say that shit to me.
— (Chuckles) So how's New Orleans?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.938
- I hear it's going slow.
— It's frustrating for everybody, you know?

24:44.067 --> 24:47.059
Why? What's taking so long?
Corruption? Bureaucracy?

24:47.195 --> 24:48.651
Some of all that, I guess.

24:48.780 --> 24:51.192
Do you think it'll ever be the same?
How can it be, right?

24:51.324 --> 24:53.861
Look at New York, Ground Zero.
9/11 changed everything.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.029
That was man-made.
This was a natural disaster.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.902
- Well, actually...
— It's apples and oranges.

24:58.039 --> 25:01.156
Not necessarily. I mean, people talk
about the slow recovery in New Orleans,

25:01.292 --> 25:03.829
but Ground Zero is still
a hole in the ground five years later.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.122
— We're talking about an entire city.
- Right, exactly.

25:06.255 --> 25:09.998
New Orleans! One of my favorite places.
I haven't been since the storm.

25:10.134 --> 25:14.127
You should go. It's different, no doubt,
but it's still the same. You know what I mean?

25:14.263 --> 25:16.094
— Mm.
— Are we talking about New Orleans?

25:16.224 --> 25:18.340
We were just saying
how different it must be now.

25:18.476 --> 25:20.762
Such a beautiful city.
Are the musicians coming back?

25:20.895 --> 25:22.476
— Some.
— Are there places for them to play?

25:22.605 --> 25:25.472
Not as many, but yeah,
they're coming back too, slow but sure.

25:25.608 --> 25:28.350
- Are you going back?
— He ain't going back. He's a New Yorker now.

25:28.486 --> 25:32.570
— An ex—pat like Wynton...
— And Harry and Branford and Christian and...

25:32.699 --> 25:34.485
That's what I like about your record —
listening to it,

25:34.617 --> 25:36.482
— I wouldn't know you were from New Orleans.
— You wouldn't?

25:36.619 --> 25:39.736
She's right. It transcends New Orleans,
like all you ex—pats do.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.784
- Transcends?
— Maybe "transcends" isn't the right word, but...

25:42.917 --> 25:46.375
— Wynton embodies New Orleans, by the way.
- Not necessarily. I mean, yes and no.

25:46.504 --> 25:47.710
Wynton is a curious case —

25:47.839 --> 25:51.081
a deracinated synthesis
of New Orleans trad jazz and big band swing.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.503
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I think you just dissed him.

25:53.636 --> 25:57.800
Let's put Wynton aside. You know
what I mean about New Orleans—style jazz.

25:57.932 --> 26:00.469
Right, that Dixieland shit.
Preservation Hall.

26:00.601 --> 26:03.013
A: It ain't Dixieland; it's trad jazz.

26:03.146 --> 26:05.432
B: There's a lot of great players at the Hall.

26:05.565 --> 26:08.102
- Great players.
— No doubt and no disrespect.

26:08.234 --> 26:11.943
But caught in that tourist economy,
like a minstrel show.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.733
— Minstrel? I don't know about that.
— Trapped in amber though.

26:14.866 --> 26:18.154
— It's a living tradition.
— (Woman) But you don't play trad jazz.

26:18.286 --> 26:20.527
You don't think I call up New Orleans
every note I play?

26:20.663 --> 26:22.369
- Well...
— Honestly, no, I don't.

26:22.498 --> 26:25.114
Ask Donald, Wynton, any of us.
All tell you the same thing.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.493
— Everything we play...
— Yeah, yeah. "Inflected with the blues."

26:28.629 --> 26:32.087
"It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing."
"New Orleans is a great big gumbo."

26:32.216 --> 26:33.592
We know the rap, the buzzwords.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.879
I know you guys all feel
like you have to say that shit.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.755
But, hey, you're here; not there.
I mean, the proofs in the pudding, right?

26:40.725 --> 26:44.593
Fuck y'all. Y'all don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.223
Excuse me.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.066
Wow. That went south in a hurry.

26:52.195 --> 26:55.062
Guess I shouldn't have
used the word "minstrel."

27:06.918 --> 27:10.706
J‘ Mr. Go, we know you gotta go

27:12.548 --> 27:15.665
J‘ Mr. Go, you've dealt your bigger blow

27:17.887 --> 27:20.970
J‘ Mr. Go, you know you gotta go

27:23.100 --> 27:26.342
J‘ Mr. Go, you've dealt your bigger blow

27:28.731 --> 27:31.143
J‘ Twenty feet of water on my crown

27:31.275 --> 27:33.732
J‘ Mr. Go, you're bringin' me down

27:33.861 --> 27:36.477
J‘ Cypress swamps that used to be

27:36.614 --> 27:38.900
J‘ Mr. Go breakin' all their knees

27:39.033 --> 27:41.945
J‘ St. Bernard, back again

27:42.078 --> 27:44.535
J‘ Lower Nine coming back again

27:44.664 --> 27:47.497
J‘ I don't know what's been said

27:47.625 --> 27:51.914
J‘ Mr. Go, you killed 'em dead

27:52.046 --> 27:54.753
One, two, three! Hit it!

28:14.151 --> 28:16.278
Whoo—hoo!

28:26.789 --> 28:30.828
— Fucking know—it—all New Yorkers.
— They were being sympathetic.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.325
Fuck their sympathy.

28:32.461 --> 28:37.421
Come on, Del. I've heard you say
all the same shit yourself, Mr. Manhattan.

28:37.550 --> 28:40.007
About how New Orleans music
is a wax museum,

28:40.136 --> 28:42.502
— a soundtrack for tourists.
- Never dissed the Hall.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.344
Never used the word "minstrel."

28:44.473 --> 28:46.429
And what the fuck does "deracinated" mean?

28:46.559 --> 28:48.891
You always talk about
how it's never gonna be the same.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.681
I get to say that. They don't.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.986
You sound good on those vocals, man.
You should do more of that.

29:00.114 --> 29:02.196
— Yeah? You think?
- The crowd dug it.

29:02.325 --> 29:05.783
Huh. It was fun. Seems like we were here
the same time last year.

29:05.912 --> 29:09.075
— At the Old Point with the Nightcrawlers.
- Oh, yeah. You gig around a lot.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.868
— So do you.
— Ever get old?

29:12.001 --> 29:14.617
— What else am I gonna do?
— I hear that.

29:14.754 --> 29:17.996
— You lead sometimes too, right?
— That's right. Sunflower City.

29:18.132 --> 29:21.169
— How is that, having your own group?
— It's like wrangling cats.

29:21.302 --> 29:24.760
— But, yeah, it's a rush. It's satisfying.
— See, that's what I'm talking about.

29:24.889 --> 29:27.255
You start thinking about
crossroads in your life, you know?

29:27.391 --> 29:29.882
Like when I picked up the trombone
instead of the trumpet.

29:30.019 --> 29:32.180
Man, life would have been
a whole lot different.

29:32.313 --> 29:34.304
You ever think about that?
With the sousaphone?

29:34.440 --> 29:37.728
You ever wish you were out front playing
the trumpet or a harmonica or something

29:37.860 --> 29:40.101
instead of that big—ass motherfucker
you gotta haul around?

29:40.237 --> 29:43.650
(Chuckles) It crossed my mind.
You thinking about picking up the trumpet?

29:43.783 --> 29:46.616
Oh, I'm playing me some trumpet.
I'm thinking about pussy.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.280
(Both laughing)

29:50.039 --> 29:53.372
Nah, man, it's too late for that.
I'm stuck with this here.

29:53.501 --> 29:56.117
Although I do think about
all the pussy I could have got

29:56.253 --> 29:59.620
if I played trumpet
instead of trombone. Man!

30:03.844 --> 30:07.052
Look, you knew I was gonna
be coming back sooner or later.

30:08.766 --> 30:11.178
— How many of y'all been living here?
- Just me and him.

30:11.310 --> 30:12.925
— I heard it was more.
- Yeah, Mardi Gras.

30:13.062 --> 30:16.145
But George working on his house, and me
and Troy are staying over at my mom's.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.854
Hmm.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.976
Look, uh,
I appreciate y'all clearing out so quick.

30:21.112 --> 30:25.731
Anytime you want me to open it up
for Indian practice, just... just let me know.

30:35.543 --> 30:37.579
(J‘ The Iguanas: Para Donde Vas)

30:43.509 --> 30:44.919
Whoa, man.

32:08.302 --> 32:09.917
(Song continues on radio)

32:10.638 --> 32:14.631
(Hidalgo) I appreciate this, cuz.
I'll catch a cab back to the hotel.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.348
Who you gotta meet downtown?

32:17.394 --> 32:18.600
A banker.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.641
You know a banker in New Orleans?

32:22.817 --> 32:24.023
Not just any banker.

32:24.902 --> 32:27.063
One of the powers behind the throne.

32:27.196 --> 32:29.152
A kingmaker.

32:30.074 --> 32:31.564
CJ Liguori.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.276
Cuz, cuz, cuz!

32:36.705 --> 32:39.242
And you know this CJ...Whoever?

32:40.501 --> 32:41.991
Let's just say...

32:42.128 --> 32:43.993
he's a friend of my friends.

32:45.256 --> 32:46.837
And he's gonna make you a king?

32:55.015 --> 32:56.391
How many kids you have?

32:56.517 --> 32:59.884
(Man) Six. Fourteen to twenty—eight.

33:00.020 --> 33:02.147
Three grandkids,
maybe another on the way.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.104
Keeps me busy.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.098
That's what it's all about, right?

33:06.235 --> 33:07.395
You?

33:07.528 --> 33:09.109
Not yet.

33:09.238 --> 33:12.150
But I come from a big family.
Thirteen.

33:12.283 --> 33:14.899
I'm smack dab in the middle.
Six older, six younger.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.162
One of seven myself.

33:17.288 --> 33:18.824
Catholic families, huh?

33:19.832 --> 33:23.620
My parish in San Antonio, growing up —
St. Alphonsus Liguori.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.663
— No kidding. Redemptorist?
— Of course.

33:25.796 --> 33:28.412
- So when I heard your name...
— We have a Saint Alphonsus here too.

33:28.549 --> 33:30.460
— You should check it out. It's beautiful.
- I will.

33:30.593 --> 33:33.881
Took a beating in the storm,
needs a lot of help.

33:34.013 --> 33:37.050
I'm active on the Building Committee
and the Capital Campaign.

33:37.183 --> 33:41.597
— I'd like to be involved in that.
— That's fantastic. I'll have somebody reach out.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.890
My mother used to say
we're direct descendants.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.433
Of the saint? I hope not.

33:45.566 --> 33:49.104
- Well, you never know. (Chuckles)
— We have other things in common too.

33:49.236 --> 33:52.854
I bring greetings from Governor Perry,
Speaker Craddick, Tina Benkiser.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.606
— Good friends. Say hello back.
— I will.

34:00.164 --> 34:03.076
From the little I've seen,
I'm beginning to get a sense of that.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.494
We still have a long way to go.

34:04.627 --> 34:06.959
Nobody's been through what
we've been through, not in this country,

34:07.087 --> 34:08.998
not since the San Francisco earthquake.

34:09.131 --> 34:12.498
But it's an ill wind that blows no good.
You understand what I'm saying?

34:13.802 --> 34:15.963
Never let a disaster go to waste.

34:16.096 --> 34:18.007
This is a unique opportunity.

34:18.641 --> 34:21.132
To put things right, to fix New Orleans.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.350
Crime, schools, infrastructure...

34:23.479 --> 34:26.471
We've been on the downhill slide
for a very long time.

34:26.607 --> 34:28.563
This is a second chance for this city.

34:29.443 --> 34:31.229
You know, at one time...

34:31.362 --> 34:33.523
we were the biggest city in the south.

34:33.656 --> 34:37.490
Then Houston and Atlanta and Dallas
left us in the dust.

34:37.618 --> 34:40.985
Now people say,
"Why rebuild New Orleans at all?"

34:41.121 --> 34:43.737
— Have you heard that in Dallas?
— (Sighs) A little.

34:43.874 --> 34:45.114
I bet you have.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.207
But there has to be a city here.

34:47.336 --> 34:49.873
The mouth of the Mississippi.
Has to be a port here.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.382
The nation needs it.
The nation needs New Orleans.

34:52.508 --> 34:55.875
And there's no reason why New Orleans
can't be a great city once again,

34:56.011 --> 34:59.048
why it can't be a great, modern,
21st—century city.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.923
— It's an exciting time to be here.
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

35:02.059 --> 35:05.643
And I hope you're here to make money,
because there is money to be made.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.729
— I can't wait to get started.
— (Boat horn blares)

35:08.857 --> 35:11.348
What a nice view you got here —
the mighty Mississippi.

35:11.485 --> 35:12.691
That's the West Bank.

35:12.820 --> 35:15.903
— But we're looking east.
- It's confusing.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.488
Huh.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.450
J‘ Azz azz azz

35:21.578 --> 35:24.069
J‘ Azz

35:24.206 --> 35:26.743
J‘ Azz azz azz J‘

35:26.875 --> 35:29.582
"Azz azz azz."

35:29.712 --> 35:31.953
That'll work. That'll work. That'll work.

35:32.089 --> 35:35.081
J‘ Azz azz azz

35:35.217 --> 35:38.425
- J‘ Azz azz azz J‘
— (Door opens and closes)

35:39.805 --> 35:41.591
- Hey.
— Hey, you.

35:41.724 --> 35:44.386
Oh, am I glad to see you.

35:44.518 --> 35:46.019
Me too.

35:52.985 --> 35:54.475
(Annie chuckles)

35:54.611 --> 35:57.193
- (Davis) Oh!
— (Annie laughs)

35:58.282 --> 36:01.900
- How was the tour?
— It was awesome. Those guys are so nice.

36:02.036 --> 36:03.992
They had me jam with them
during their set every night.

36:04.121 --> 36:05.327
— Oh, fantastic.
— Yeah.

36:05.456 --> 36:07.572
— They hit on you?
— (Chuckles)

36:07.708 --> 36:10.495
- Perfect gentlemen.
— Yeah, Magnie and Malone, maybe.

36:10.627 --> 36:15.792
Messa is a dog. Amedee with his beret
and the tambourine shtick...

36:15.924 --> 36:17.539
A chick magnet.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.134
Davis?

36:23.223 --> 36:25.350
You cleaned for me.

36:25.476 --> 36:28.513
Kinda smells like a spring meadow,
doesn't it?

36:28.645 --> 36:31.261
(Laughs) Yeah, yeah.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.236
(Distant dog barking)

37:26.662 --> 37:29.574
— (LaDonna) That was nice.
— Mm—hm.

37:29.706 --> 37:32.288
You're not gonna turn on the TV, are you?

37:32.418 --> 37:34.625
No, uh—uh.

37:37.047 --> 37:38.378
Gotta thank your mama.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.247
For what?

37:40.384 --> 37:43.171
- Taking the boys.
— She didn't want to stay over.

37:43.303 --> 37:46.795
She just wanted to check up on Daymo,
you know? Make sure his grave all right,

37:46.932 --> 37:49.674
visit with him awhile,
go on back to Baton Rouge.

37:50.561 --> 37:51.801
Thanks, baby.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.058
I like it when you shout.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.107
— Was I shouting?
- In the end.

37:59.236 --> 38:01.443
"Oh, baby!

38:01.572 --> 38:04.609
— "Oh, baby!"
— (Chuckles)

38:04.741 --> 38:08.199
Well, I figured if I stick with "baby,"
I'm safe.

38:08.328 --> 38:10.660
Mm! Long as you thinkin' bout me.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.363
Who else...baby?

38:18.130 --> 38:21.372
Now that Mama living with us,
you can come down here more.

38:22.342 --> 38:25.505
Be alone together as often as you want.

38:26.513 --> 38:30.882
Not like we have any privacy
on the weekends when I'm up there, huh?

38:35.564 --> 38:37.395
What time you have to go in the morning?

38:38.233 --> 38:39.973
Not too early.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.522
— First patient's at nine.
— Mm.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.987
— You want to ride up with me?
— Mm. Gotta open the bar.

38:47.367 --> 38:50.154
LaDonna,
when are you gonna come home?

38:51.788 --> 38:54.450
— I am home.
— No, this is your mama's home,

38:54.583 --> 38:56.699
and she's not coming back.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.372
Now we need to sell this place.
We need to sell the bar.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.370
I ain't selling the bar, Larry.

39:01.507 --> 39:04.874
You got no reason not to, LaDonna,
now that she's up there.

39:05.010 --> 39:08.753
— You're here all alone.
— You come visit me more during the week,

39:08.889 --> 39:10.845
I won't be here all alone.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.930
Oh, no, you're changing the subject.

39:13.060 --> 39:15.051
—Mmm!
— No.

39:15.187 --> 39:18.805
J‘ Spread joy to the maximum

39:18.941 --> 39:22.559
J‘ Bring gloom down to the minimum, and...

39:22.694 --> 39:25.902
J‘ Have faith, or pandemonium...

39:26.031 --> 39:29.114
J‘ ls liable to walk upon the scene

39:29.243 --> 39:33.657
J‘ To illustrate my last remark

39:33.789 --> 39:37.122
J‘ Jonah in the whale and Noah in the ark

39:37.251 --> 39:38.707
J‘ What did they do

39:38.835 --> 39:42.327
J‘ When things got very dark?

39:42.464 --> 39:44.295
J‘ Oh, yeah

39:44.424 --> 39:49.214
J‘ They said, accentuate the positive

39:49.346 --> 39:52.930
J‘ Eliminate the negative, and...

39:53.058 --> 39:56.175
J‘ Latch on to the affirmative

39:56.311 --> 39:59.474
J‘ And don't mess with Mr. In—between

40:30.095 --> 40:34.964
J‘ They said, accentuate the positive

40:35.100 --> 40:38.843
J‘ Eliminate the negative and... J‘

40:38.979 --> 40:40.389
How long for 14?

40:40.522 --> 40:41.887
Ten seconds on the cod.
Good on the salmon?

40:42.024 --> 40:43.480
— Coming up with you.
- Ready on the duck.

40:43.609 --> 40:46.100
What about my pigeon?
You got my fucking pigeon? Talk to me.

40:46.236 --> 40:47.692
Yes, Chef. Now, Chef.

40:47.821 --> 40:49.857
— Picking up — one cod.
— One cod.

40:49.990 --> 40:51.400
— One salmon.
— One salmon.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.114
— One pigeon.
— One pigeon.

40:53.243 --> 40:54.858
— Two ducks.
— Two ducks.

41:03.545 --> 41:06.002
(Man) Are you good on the broth?
(Man 2) Taking it now, Chef.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.338
(Man) All right, let's go.
Put it in the bowl.

41:09.343 --> 41:13.177
(Man 1) How many more do you have all day?
(Man 2) Three all day, Chef.

41:16.224 --> 41:20.137
(Man) Put salt and pepper in it.
(Man 2) Yes, Chef.

41:20.270 --> 41:22.727
(Man) Finish that sauce.
I got two more scallops coming up.

41:22.856 --> 41:24.847
Motherfucker.

41:25.859 --> 41:28.066
Motherfucker!

41:33.909 --> 41:35.900
Start again.

41:36.036 --> 41:38.448
Table 14 — one cod, one salmon,

41:38.580 --> 41:41.037
one pigeon, two ducks.

41:44.294 --> 41:48.879
Think it might be possible that we can get the
ducks right this time, Mr. fucking grill man?

41:49.007 --> 41:51.123
Do you think that might be
within the realm of possibility,

41:51.259 --> 41:55.423
that you cook two duck breasts properly
and maybe dress them before you slice them

41:55.555 --> 41:57.967
and not fuck over your coworkers
and my customers

41:58.100 --> 42:02.514
by doing miserable, half—assed,
thoroughly unacceptable work?

42:02.646 --> 42:04.227
— Can you do that, Chef?
— I'm sorry, Chef.

42:04.356 --> 42:05.971
No, don't. I don't want you to be sorry.

42:06.108 --> 42:12.604
I don't need that. What I need is for you
to not fuck with my food again.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.150
- Yes, Chef.
— Is that understood?

42:15.283 --> 42:16.864
Yes, Chef.

42:16.993 --> 42:21.282
(Saucier) They're walking in.
New table. Got one scallop...

42:21.415 --> 42:27.035
And the frickin' National Guard is patrolling
our streets like we're Fallujah or something.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.621
So you know what?

42:30.757 --> 42:33.669
Drop and give me 50, you fucking fucks.

42:33.802 --> 42:37.886
(On radio) J‘ Drop and gimme 50
Drop and gimme 50... J‘

42:39.224 --> 42:41.966
J‘ I'm in some foreign place

42:42.102 --> 42:44.935
J‘ And I don't know a face where I am

43:21.016 --> 43:23.052
J‘ Oh my sisters

43:23.185 --> 43:24.800
J‘ When I got in trouble

43:24.936 --> 43:27.848
J‘ They were always bitching

43:27.981 --> 43:30.188
J‘ Lolette, Lanette, Lilian, Lorna

43:30.317 --> 43:33.855
J‘ Lita, Lonora

J‘ Everything I'm bringing

43:37.449 --> 43:40.691
J‘ Every song I'm singing's for you

43:42.370 --> 43:44.577
J‘ I'm in some foreign place

43:44.706 --> 43:46.492
J‘ And I don't know a face

J‘ Where I am

(Applause, cheering)

44:26.748 --> 44:29.285
Thanks.
Hey, that was nice.

44:29.417 --> 44:30.998
You sound great, darling.

44:31.127 --> 44:33.459
You too. See you.

44:33.588 --> 44:34.839
See you.

44:40.637 --> 44:42.969
Y'all were great.

44:43.098 --> 44:45.680
— Hejust showed up.
- I'm not worried.

44:46.560 --> 44:47.675
(Laughs)

44:47.811 --> 44:49.517
I'll say hi.

44:52.649 --> 44:55.356
— Hey, man.
— What's going on, baby?

44:55.485 --> 44:57.646
— Good to see you.
— Hey, daddy—o.

44:57.779 --> 45:00.236
— Hey, nicejob.
— Thanks, man.

45:00.365 --> 45:02.697
— You been good?
- Yeah, yeah.

45:03.577 --> 45:05.943
Hey, I heard you were
at that club the other night.

45:06.079 --> 45:08.070
Scared the shit out of me, man.

45:08.206 --> 45:09.662
Yeah.

45:09.791 --> 45:10.826
Annie seems well.

45:10.959 --> 45:12.244
Yeah, she's doing great.

45:12.377 --> 45:16.746
She just, uh... she just came off the road,
opening for the Subdudes.

45:17.674 --> 45:19.915
— A girl and her fiddle.
- Whoa.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.667
Her chops just get better and better.
Singing too.

45:22.804 --> 45:26.672
— Yeah, sky's the limit, don't you think?
— Yeah. Yeah, I do.

45:29.644 --> 45:31.350
Well, it's nice to see you, man.

45:31.479 --> 45:32.559
— Take care.
- All right.

45:32.689 --> 45:33.849
Take care of her.

45:33.982 --> 45:35.722
Yeah, always.

45:53.001 --> 45:55.413
(Speaks Spanish)

45:55.545 --> 45:57.831
Man, they can't understand
a word you're saying.

45:57.964 --> 46:00.546
'Cause they're all from Honduras
and El Salvador and shit.

46:00.675 --> 46:03.052
No, it's 'cause your Spanish is
de la chingada!

46:03.845 --> 46:05.836
Come on, I'll take you to lunch.

46:07.766 --> 46:10.223
— Where'd you get the wheels? A rental?
— It's nice, huh?

46:10.352 --> 46:12.217
— I'm leasing it.
— That mean you're staying?

46:12.354 --> 46:15.187
Means I'm driving back to Dallas in style
when I go. Where to?

46:15.315 --> 46:19.604
— Burrito wagon over on Claiborne. It's not bad.
— Cuz, cuz, cuz, this is New Orleans.

46:19.736 --> 46:21.522
The food's supposed to be great.

46:21.655 --> 46:23.896
Come on. A guy told me about a place.

46:25.575 --> 46:29.443
The cops thought they were being fired on.
They were being fired on.

46:29.579 --> 46:32.321
Not by the people they shot.
And they weren't being fired on.

46:32.457 --> 46:36.041
— The only people firing guns were cops.
— Toni, how can you know that?

46:37.128 --> 46:38.243
Terry.

46:40.674 --> 46:42.539
All right, fuck it. You know what?

46:43.468 --> 46:45.424
I guess it'll all get sorted out.

46:45.553 --> 46:49.546
(Chuckles) Yeah.
Well, thanks for giving me copies of these.

46:49.683 --> 46:53.221
When are you gonna stop harassing
the musicians on Jackson Square?

46:53.353 --> 46:55.594
Oh, are we gonna fight about that too?

46:59.359 --> 47:00.599
How's Sofia?

47:02.779 --> 47:05.395
Depressed, angry, anxious.

47:05.532 --> 47:06.692
Aren't we all?

47:06.825 --> 47:08.907
Everybody is out of their minds.

47:10.996 --> 47:13.908
— How are yours?
— Fine. I guess.

47:14.749 --> 47:18.287
Whenever I do manage to get 'em
on the phone, it's always monosyllables

47:18.420 --> 47:21.207
and, you know, multitasking.
I can always tell.

47:21.339 --> 47:22.499
"Yeah.

47:22.632 --> 47:23.963
"Uh—huh.

47:24.092 --> 47:25.878
"Sure, Dad.

47:26.011 --> 47:27.000
"What?"

47:27.137 --> 47:29.002
Sounds familiar.

47:31.891 --> 47:33.631
It's been six months.

47:34.644 --> 47:35.929
Seven.

47:37.313 --> 47:39.224
Things getting any better?

47:40.150 --> 47:41.765
Worse, I'd say.

47:45.071 --> 47:46.607
Talk about it?

47:47.782 --> 47:50.649
It was an accident.
That's what she knows.

47:57.500 --> 47:58.706
Mmm.

48:00.754 --> 48:01.960
Everything OK here?

48:02.088 --> 48:04.921
Fantastic.
What do you call this thing again?

48:05.050 --> 48:09.259
Uh, Frenchuletta. It's our version
of a Muffuletta, served on French.

48:09.387 --> 48:10.718
Really?

48:10.847 --> 48:13.884
Muffuletta. Ooh!

48:14.017 --> 48:15.097
Got it.

48:15.226 --> 48:18.935
Pontchartrain, Tchoupitoulas, muffaletta...
I'm learning stuff.

48:19.064 --> 48:21.146
Listen, I'll take the other half with me.

48:21.274 --> 48:23.060
All right, I'll get you a go box, baby.

48:23.193 --> 48:25.309
— Thank you, darling.
— You're welcome.

48:26.362 --> 48:28.444
Look at this thing.
It's the size of la verga mia.

48:28.573 --> 48:30.359
I gotta take a picture of that.

48:31.367 --> 48:34.359
I love this town.
Why didn't anybody tell me about it before?

48:34.496 --> 48:37.158
I've been calling you for the last six months,
trying to get you down here.

48:37.290 --> 48:40.077
You never said how great it was. You just said
there was dinero lying in the streets.

48:40.210 --> 48:41.871
— Yeah.
- Hey...

48:42.003 --> 48:45.370
you know a place we can
go hear some music tonight?

48:46.299 --> 48:48.164
Cuz, cuz, cuz!

48:49.010 --> 48:50.546
There's more to life than money.

49:02.524 --> 49:04.230
(Dog barks in distance)

49:32.720 --> 49:33.971
(Sighs)

49:54.450 --> 49:55.781
How's school?

49:56.744 --> 49:58.120
It's all right.

50:02.333 --> 50:05.325
Haven't seen any tests or quizzes recently.

50:05.461 --> 50:07.042
Haven't been any.

50:07.922 --> 50:09.708
Really?

50:18.183 --> 50:20.174
What are you reading in English?

50:21.102 --> 50:23.388
Frederick Douglass's autobiography.

50:27.442 --> 50:29.649
Parent—teacher conferences
are coming up soon.

50:29.777 --> 50:31.733
I'm not in for any surprises, am I?

50:32.447 --> 50:33.687
Hmm?

50:34.782 --> 50:36.363
Sofia.

50:37.660 --> 50:39.196
Are you making friends?

50:39.954 --> 50:42.445
Mom, I have the same friends
I had last semester.

50:42.582 --> 50:45.119
The school is gorgeous, state—of—the—art.

50:45.251 --> 50:48.163
The teachers are just the best —
so caring and committed.

50:48.296 --> 50:52.039
The student body is so perfectly
Benetton—diverse, it makes you wanna puke.

50:52.175 --> 50:54.257
You could take a picture of it
and put it on TV.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.967
I just asked a civil question.
I don't need your sarcasm.

50:57.096 --> 50:59.678
I'm just saying. Status quo, OK?

50:59.807 --> 51:01.422
Everything's status quo.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.936
If anything changes, I'll let you know.

51:07.023 --> 51:08.138
(Door opens)

51:09.567 --> 51:10.807
(Door slams shut)

51:12.362 --> 51:15.946
I think this new quarterback looks...
pretty good.

51:16.074 --> 51:17.314
Hmm.

51:17.450 --> 51:19.987
And we know Reggie Bush can bring it.

51:20.119 --> 51:22.952
Ah—ha! Heisman damn Trophy.

51:23.081 --> 51:24.662
— OK?
— (Man) Yeah, you're right.

51:24.791 --> 51:27.328
(LaDonna) Whoo! This could be our year.

51:28.920 --> 51:31.582
— Mr. Riley, Mr. Reyes.
- LaDee.

51:31.714 --> 51:34.251
- And who do we have here?
— Mrs. Williams, my cousin Nelson.

51:34.384 --> 51:35.965
— Oh!
— How are you, ma'am?

51:36.094 --> 51:37.379
I'm fine.

51:38.263 --> 51:40.254
What'll you all have?
Can I buy you boys a beer?

51:40.390 --> 51:41.550
No music tonight?

51:41.683 --> 51:43.264
Music?

51:43.393 --> 51:45.475
— You said there was music.
— We got a jukebox.

51:45.603 --> 51:47.264
- That'll work.
— Have a seat.

51:47.397 --> 51:50.981
— Y'all really cousins?
— (Riley) That's what I said.

51:51.109 --> 51:53.191
Look, the jukebox is over here.

51:53.945 --> 51:55.435
Thank you, ma'am.

51:55.571 --> 51:57.823
Don't be calling me ma'am. LaDonna.

51:57.949 --> 52:01.032
LaDonna? That's a beautiful name.

52:07.667 --> 52:09.203
All right, boys.

52:11.212 --> 52:13.578
"El Pavo." Sounds Latin.

52:16.342 --> 52:19.049
— (Song starts)
— ls Latin!

52:21.639 --> 52:24.881
— (Man) Look at your boy over there!
— What?

52:25.018 --> 52:26.303
(Man) Yeah!
(Man 2) Check this out.

52:26.436 --> 52:27.972
(LaDonna) Oh!

52:28.855 --> 52:30.766
(Laughter)

52:30.898 --> 52:34.061
(LaDonna) Look at all that brought up in here.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.773
(Laughing) Ha! OK.

52:38.906 --> 52:41.488
(LaDonna) OK, all right, Antonio Banderas.

52:43.453 --> 52:45.114
Ahh!

52:50.168 --> 52:51.704
That's what I'm talking about.

52:53.963 --> 52:56.079
Whoo! I give up.

52:56.215 --> 52:57.751
J‘ From the corner to the block

52:58.468 --> 53:00.379
J‘ From the corner
to the block

53:01.012 --> 53:03.219
J‘ From the corner to the block... J‘

53:03.348 --> 53:05.634
How do they make this all go together?

53:05.767 --> 53:07.974
It's New Orleans.
We put everything together.

53:08.102 --> 53:10.935
— You know what "gumbo ya—ya" really means?
— No.

53:11.064 --> 53:12.850
Everyone talks at once.

53:13.983 --> 53:16.019
J‘ Freret and Louisiana,
camouflaged bandana

53:16.152 --> 53:18.814
J‘ Round there I had to man up,
Magnolia had to stand up

53:18.946 --> 53:21.323
J‘ Didn't believe in Santa,
hustled in front of Grandma

53:21.449 --> 53:23.405
J‘ Last seen in the circle
when the lights went out

53:23.534 --> 53:26.025
J‘ I must have made about
a couple hundred thousand in drops

53:26.162 --> 53:28.153
J‘ Toledano and Robertson
when I was out and about... J‘

53:28.289 --> 53:31.156
I'll take you to hear
the Klezmer All Stars sometime.

53:31.292 --> 53:33.203
Uh... Ben Ellman?

53:33.336 --> 53:35.497
He plays with them too.
You could sit in.

53:35.630 --> 53:37.996
I don't play klezmer.

53:38.132 --> 53:39.668
With them.

53:39.801 --> 53:41.337
On fiddle?

53:41.469 --> 53:43.130
I don't think so.

53:43.262 --> 53:45.218
Fiddle goes with everything!

53:45.348 --> 53:46.838
It's like hot sauce.

53:48.684 --> 53:50.424
J‘ From the corner to the block

53:51.020 --> 53:52.931
J‘ From the corner to the block

53:53.731 --> 53:55.517
J‘ Hey

53:55.650 --> 53:57.481
J‘ Keep 'em up now, keep 'em up now

53:57.610 --> 53:58.895
J‘ Keep 'em up now

53:59.028 --> 54:01.360
J‘ Keep 'em up now, keep 'em up now

54:01.489 --> 54:02.820
J‘ Listen!

54:04.033 --> 54:05.898
J‘ TC and LD with me

54:06.035 --> 54:08.196
J‘ 6th and Willow,
Washington and Clara Street with me

54:08.329 --> 54:11.196
J‘ My front porch was the bus stop
My face was a mug shot

54:11.332 --> 54:13.698
J‘ Money was running low
so I hit some hustles and whatnot

54:13.835 --> 54:15.951
J‘ Right on Elysian Fields
Me and Rickie at the truck stop

54:16.087 --> 54:18.920
J‘ Back to the hood with the good
to make the cut out

54:19.048 --> 54:21.130
J‘ This is my corner
where I'm prone to get shuteye

54:21.259 --> 54:23.625
J‘ Juvie the great man
Who else could do it but I?

54:23.761 --> 54:25.877
J‘ From the corner to the block

54:26.013 --> 54:27.753
J‘ From the corner
to the block

54:28.391 --> 54:30.848
J‘ From the corner to the block

54:30.977 --> 54:33.639
J‘ From the corner to the block... J‘

55:02.800 --> 55:04.631
(I I'll Fly Away)

55:54.727 --> 55:56.308
How long you been playing, man?

55:56.437 --> 55:57.938
Two months.

55:59.398 --> 56:01.855
- It's hard.
— It'll get easier.

56:03.736 --> 56:04.816
Hope so.

56:04.946 --> 56:06.561
(Siren whooping)

56:06.697 --> 56:09.439
Me too. Me too.

56:12.411 --> 56:15.949
— Lt. says I'm early relief 'cause I got court.
— Which is bullshit.

56:16.082 --> 56:17.492
Which is bullshit.

56:17.625 --> 56:21.789
If I gotta be in court till three or four every day,
then why I gotta come in early?

56:23.005 --> 56:25.121
— What have you got?
- Straight-up robbery.

56:25.258 --> 56:28.000
Two kids on bikes.
She was a little slow giving up her purse.

56:28.135 --> 56:30.387
(Sighs) All right.

56:30.513 --> 56:31.673
Thanks.

56:31.806 --> 56:34.263
— Why the lieutenant gotta do you like that?
- Fuck if I know.

56:34.392 --> 56:37.259
He rides me five times harder
than anybody else on the squad.

56:37.395 --> 56:41.809
I didn't do a motherfucking thing to deserve it.
A couple of my cases went south last month...

56:46.571 --> 56:48.778
(J‘ Trumpet plays in distance)

56:52.535 --> 56:55.743
(J‘ Practices scales)

57:01.002 --> 57:03.038
Kid. You! Hey!

57:04.005 --> 57:06.712
There's a curfew.
The fuck are you doing?

57:06.841 --> 57:08.422
Go home.
