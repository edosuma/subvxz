WEBVTT

00:01.072 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:05.076
DETECTIVE VANCE
GOT AGGRESSIVE...

00:05.076 --> 00:06.137
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?

00:06.137 --> 00:08.138
(gasps)
 BUT BEN CAME TO THE RESCUE.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.341
IT'S PRETTY HARD TO BUILD
A CASE WITHOUT A BODY.

00:10.341 --> 00:12.313
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.086
AND MIKE GOT RID OF THE BODY.

00:15.086 --> 00:18.189
BUT SO MANY SECRETS LED
TO A FALLING-OUT...

00:18.189 --> 00:21.092
WE'RE DONE.
 DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE OVERREACTING?

00:21.092 --> 00:23.394
I DON'T THINK SHE IS.

00:23.394 --> 00:29.029
AND SUSAN EXPRESSED HER ANGER
THE ONLY WAY SHE KNEW HOW.

00:34.265 --> 00:36.137
THERE IS NOTHING MORE PEACEFUL

00:36.137 --> 00:40.311
THAN THE SOUNDS
OF WISTERIA LANE AT NIGHT.

00:40.311 --> 00:42.173
(TV playing indistinctly)

00:42.173 --> 00:44.375
WHETHER IT'S THE MURMUR
OF A NEIGHBOR'S TELEVISION...

00:44.375 --> 00:48.179
(man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

00:48.179 --> 00:50.121
THE HUM OF THE STREET LAMPS...

00:50.121 --> 00:54.325
(humming)

00:54.325 --> 00:56.387
OR THE SONGS
OF THE NIGHT BIRDS...

00:56.387 --> 01:00.131
(birds twittering)

01:00.131 --> 01:02.263
WISTERIA LANE IS SO PEACEFUL

01:02.263 --> 01:05.266
THAT EVEN
THE SLIGHTEST DISTURBANCE...

01:05.266 --> 01:07.138
(door slams in distance,
footsteps)

01:07.138 --> 01:10.371
CAN BE VERY ALARMING.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.303
(gasping)

01:12.303 --> 01:14.074
(beep)
 (telephone rings)

01:14.074 --> 01:15.276
(woman) 9-1-1.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.377
(lowered voice)
THERE'S AN INTRUDER IN MY HOME.

01:16.377 --> 01:19.280
I'M AT 4355 WISTERIA LANE.
PLEASE HURRY.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.381
(receiver clatters)

01:39.170 --> 01:40.301
(whispering) OH, MY GOD.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.472
(switch clicks)

01:41.472 --> 01:43.274
CHUCK.

01:43.274 --> 01:45.436
HELLO, BREE.

01:45.436 --> 01:47.208
(normal voice)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.309
I COULD HAVE SHOT YOU.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.110
I HEARD YOUR CALL
OVER THE RADIO.

01:50.110 --> 01:54.185
WHEN I GOT HERE,
THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN, SO...

01:56.247 --> 01:58.249
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
A LOOK AROUND.

01:59.390 --> 02:02.293
IF YOU DON'T MIND PUTTING
THE GUN IN YOUR POCKET

02:02.293 --> 02:05.125
WHILE I DO.

02:10.261 --> 02:12.403
SO TELL ME AGAIN
WHAT YOU HEARD.

02:12.403 --> 02:17.368
UM, A LOUD BANG
AND THEN SOME FOOTSTEPS,

02:17.368 --> 02:20.511
LIKE, UM, LIKE SOMEONE HAD
FORCED THEIR WAY IN.

02:20.511 --> 02:22.213
ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T

02:22.213 --> 02:24.215
ACCIDENTALLY
LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN?

02:24.215 --> 02:25.476
I'M POSITIVE I LOCKED IT.

02:25.476 --> 02:29.180
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

02:29.180 --> 02:31.182
MAYBE IT WAS JUST SOME DRIFTER
LOOKING FOR A FEW BUCKS,

02:31.182 --> 02:32.353
AND YOU SCARED HIM OFF.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.525
WE DON'T GET A LOT
OF DRIFTERS AROUND HERE.

02:34.525 --> 02:36.257
EXCEPT FOR THAT GUY WE SAW

02:36.257 --> 02:39.460
RIGHT OUT FRONT
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.462
THE ONE WHO TURNED UP
AS A MISSING PERSON?

02:41.462 --> 02:44.265
(gasps) I TOLD YOU, I DON'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.537
AND YET YOU'RE POSITIVE
YOU LOCKED YOUR DOOR

02:46.537 --> 02:48.369
BEFORE YOU WENT TO BED
LAST NIGHT.

02:48.369 --> 02:52.303
(chuckles) IT'S FUNNY,
THE THINGS WE REMEMBER

02:52.303 --> 02:54.245
AND THE THINGS WE DON'T.

02:54.245 --> 02:55.446
ARE YOU INTERROGATING ME?

02:55.446 --> 02:57.448
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

02:57.448 --> 03:01.181
YOU'RE A VICTIM.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.553
AND WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

03:02.553 --> 03:06.557
BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

03:06.557 --> 03:08.319
SOMEONE'S SENDING YOU
A MESSAGE.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.323
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE?

03:12.323 --> 03:15.326
MAYBE THEY THINK
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

03:15.326 --> 03:17.468
MAYBE THEY'RE TRYING
TO RATTLE YOU,

03:17.468 --> 03:20.200
HOPING YOU'LL SLIP UP.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.302
OR MAYBE THEY JUST
DON'T WANT YOU

03:21.302 --> 03:23.474
TO FEEL SAFE
IN YOUR OWN HOME.

03:26.477 --> 03:29.410
YES, THERE'S NOTHING
MORE PEACEFUL

03:29.410 --> 03:32.443
THAN A NIGHT ON WISTERIA LANE.

03:32.443 --> 03:36.247
BUT I WOULDN'T LOSE
ANY SLEEP OVER THIS, BREE.

03:36.247 --> 03:38.589
I'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE
ON YOU.

03:38.589 --> 03:41.492
UNTIL SOMEONE COMES ALONG...

03:43.254 --> 03:45.526
AND DISTURBS THE PEACE.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.541
IN A STRESSFUL WORLD,

04:00.541 --> 04:05.576
WE CAN ALL BE FORGIVEN
FOR HAVING A FEW WEAKNESSES.

04:05.576 --> 04:09.580
SOME OF US ARE LURED
BY A SWEET TREAT...

04:09.580 --> 04:13.584
OTHERS, BY A SAD FACE.

04:15.486 --> 04:22.433
AND STILL OTHERS,
BY THE PULL OF A GREAT NOVEL.

04:22.433 --> 04:25.566
BUT GABRIELLE SOLIS
WAS ABOUT TO DISCOVER

04:25.566 --> 04:27.638
THAT SOME WEAKNESSES...

04:27.638 --> 04:29.470
IS HE YOURS?

04:30.541 --> 04:34.305
AREN'T SO EASY TO FORGIVE.

04:34.305 --> 04:36.507
(sighs) DEPENDS. IS HE DRUNK?

04:36.507 --> 04:39.650
UNLESS HE THROWS UP IN CABS
WHEN HE'S SOBER?

04:39.650 --> 04:43.414
(sighs) I'M SO SORRY.

04:43.414 --> 04:46.357
HERE'S 20 BUCKS FOR THE RIDE

04:46.357 --> 04:49.520
AND ANOTHER 20
FOR YOUR UPHOLSTERY.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.494
THIS WILL MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.625
OH, IT SMELLS LIKE HOT SAUCE.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.527
YEAH,
IT'S A MEXICAN HANGOVER CURE.

04:56.527 --> 04:58.469
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I INHERITED FROM MY FAMILY

04:58.469 --> 05:01.332
THAT'S ACTUALLY WORTH
ANYTHING.

05:03.504 --> 05:06.577
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.

05:06.577 --> 05:08.639
I THOUGHT IT WOULD GET BETTER
AFTER BEN DID WHAT HE DID,

05:08.639 --> 05:12.343
BUT... IT HASN'T.

05:12.343 --> 05:14.314
MAYBE WE NEED
TO GET YOU HELP,

05:14.314 --> 05:15.646
LIKE REHAB OR SOMETHING.

05:15.646 --> 05:18.318
I'M NOT ADDICTED, GABY.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.352
IT'S JUST WHEN I'M STRESSED,
THIS IS WHAT I DO.

05:21.352 --> 05:23.323
REALLY? YOU WERE STRESSED
ON THE GOLF COURSE THIS MORNING?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.356
(sighs) IT WAS WORK,

05:25.356 --> 05:28.399
AND THERE'S ALWAYS DRINKING
WHEN IT'S WORK.

05:28.399 --> 05:29.500
WE'RE GOLFING WITH A CLIENT--
BEER.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.631
WE'RE HAMMERING OUT A DEAL--
WINE.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.633
WE MAKE THE DEAL--CHAMPAGNE.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.666
WELL, MAYBE YOU NEED TO TAKE
A LITTLE TIME AWAY FROM WORK.

05:35.666 --> 05:38.409
DRY OUT.
KICK-START YOUR SOBRIETY.

05:38.409 --> 05:41.572
I AM THE C.E.O. IF I DO THAT,
THE WHOLE PLACE WILL FALL APART.

05:41.572 --> 05:44.344
AND IF YOU DON'T,
YOU'LL FALL APART.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.417
(sighs)

05:46.417 --> 05:49.550
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.722
BUT I CAN'T DO IT TODAY.
I GOT PAYROLL TO SIGN.

05:51.722 --> 05:53.554
BUT YOU'RE SWEATING BOURBON.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.386
I'LL GO IN
AND I'LL SIGN IT FOR YOU.

05:55.386 --> 05:56.527
YOU CAN'T SIGN MY NAME.

05:56.527 --> 05:58.529
OH, PLEASE, I FORGE
YOUR SIGNATURE ALL THE TIME.

05:58.529 --> 06:00.691
HOW ELSE DO YOU THINK I GOT
THAT PLATINUM CARD?

06:00.691 --> 06:03.564
(sighs) WOW,
I MUST BE IN BAD SHAPE.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.536
I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE ENERGY
TO GET MAD.

06:05.536 --> 06:07.568
WELL, WITH ANY LUCK,
YOU'LL FORGET I SAID IT.

06:10.701 --> 06:13.373
I'M SURE SOME OF YOU FEEL

06:13.373 --> 06:15.546
I'VE BEEN TOO HARD ON YOU
THESE PAST FEW WEEKS.

06:15.546 --> 06:18.709
I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US
WHEN I SAY "ALL OF US."

06:18.709 --> 06:21.452
WELL, AFTER TODAY, YOU WILL LONG
FOR THE MOTHER'S MILK

06:21.452 --> 06:23.514
THAT HAS BEEN MY CRITICISM.

06:23.514 --> 06:26.417
PLEASE MEET OUR SPECIAL GUEST,
MY ART DEALER

06:26.417 --> 06:28.719
AND THE OWNER
OF THE BERGMAN GALLERY--

06:28.719 --> 06:32.723
FELIX BERGMAN.

06:32.723 --> 06:36.667
I SMELL FEAR AND MEDIOCRITY.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.398
(lowered voice) OH, GOD.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.471
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE LEFT ANDRE
IN THE DRYER TOO LONG.

06:40.471 --> 06:41.532
SHH!

06:41.532 --> 06:43.534
FELIX HAS AGREED
TO EVALUATE YOUR WORK,

06:43.534 --> 06:45.405
GIVE HONEST FEEDBACK,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.407
AND TEACH YOU
THE BUSINESS OF ART.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.481
SO... WHAT DO YOU CALL
THIS PIECE?

06:50.481 --> 06:53.413
"A CELEBRATION
OF THE FEMALE NUDE."

06:53.413 --> 06:55.616
THIS IS WHY I DON'T SLEEP
WITH WOMEN.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.747
IT'S REPULSIVE.

06:56.747 --> 06:58.689
WELL, IT'S NOT A LITERAL--

06:58.689 --> 07:01.722
MIND DRIFTING,
EYELIDS DROOPING, AND...

07:01.722 --> 07:04.495
(singsongy, high-pitched voice)
I'M GONE.

07:04.495 --> 07:07.558
HE'S NOT A CRITIC.
HE'S A LITTLE BALL OF HATE.

07:07.558 --> 07:08.559
OH!

07:08.559 --> 07:09.730
OH, GOD.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.562
NO ART STUDENT'S PORTFOLIO
WOULD BE COMPLETE

07:11.562 --> 07:15.536
WITHOUT THE OBLIGATORY
SQUARES AND CIRCLES COLLIDING,

07:15.536 --> 07:19.439
OR WHAT I LIKE TO CALL
MAN'S INHUMANITY TO ART.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.672
WELL, AMY'S ONE OF
MY MOST PROMISING STUDENTS.

07:21.672 --> 07:26.577
I FIND HER WORK TO BE BOLD,
DEFIANT, AND DAZZLINGLY LAYERED.

07:26.577 --> 07:29.449
YOU'RE SHTUPPING HER,
AREN'T YOU? (chuckles)

07:29.449 --> 07:32.823
REGARDLESS, I JUST THINK THAT
THERE'S A PLACE FOR HER WORK.

07:32.823 --> 07:37.528
I THINK YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

07:37.528 --> 07:38.659
(singsongy) FOUND IT.

07:41.532 --> 07:45.465
SO... WHAT DOYOUHAVE FOR ME?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.568
THE SAME THING YOU HAVE FOR US--
CONTEMPT.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.470
EXCUSE ME?
 WE GET IT.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.774
YOU'RE A SUPER SOPHISTICATED
ART SNOB WHO HATES EVERYTHING.

07:53.774 --> 07:57.477
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
I'M NOT PLAYING.
 SUSAN...

07:57.477 --> 07:58.849
NO. I AM NOT GETTING MY TEETH
KICKED IN

07:58.849 --> 08:01.812
JUST BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER
DIDN'T BREAST-FEED YOU.

08:01.812 --> 08:03.754
GO PLAY YOUR GAME
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.688
(scoffs and chuckles)

08:07.688 --> 08:09.560
(lowered voice) LOOK, IF YOU
WANNA BE A PROFESSIONAL ARTIST,

08:09.560 --> 08:12.563
YOU NEED TO DEVELOP
A THICK SKIN.

08:12.563 --> 08:14.565
DID YOU PAINT THIS?

08:14.565 --> 08:17.528
(sighs)

08:17.528 --> 08:19.570
YES, I DID,
AND I HAVE NO INTEREST

08:19.570 --> 08:20.771
IN HEARING WHAT YOU THINK OF IT.

08:20.771 --> 08:23.634
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD,
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT.

08:23.634 --> 08:24.635
REALLY?

08:24.635 --> 08:25.706
REALLY?

08:25.706 --> 08:26.877
IT'S ORIGINAL.

08:26.877 --> 08:29.580
DARK, BROODING.
IT TELLS A STORY.

08:29.580 --> 08:31.742
I'M TOTALLY DRAWN IN.

08:31.742 --> 08:34.615
CONGRATULATIONS, ANDRE.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.787
I DO BELIEVE
YOU'VE STRUCK ARTIST.

08:36.787 --> 08:39.519
(sighs)

08:39.519 --> 08:40.691
YEAH, I SUPPOSE
SHE SHOWS PROMISE.

08:40.691 --> 08:42.722
SHE MAY AMOUNT TO SOMETHING
ONE DAY.

08:42.722 --> 08:43.823
ONE DAY?

08:43.823 --> 08:45.726
THIS GIRL HAS ARRIVED.

08:45.726 --> 08:49.630
IN FACT, SHE REMINDS ME
OF A YOUNG... YOU.

08:51.902 --> 08:53.804
NOW, NOW...

08:53.804 --> 08:57.668
WHERE'S THAT THICK SKIN
YOU WERE CROWING ABOUT?

08:59.810 --> 09:03.614
AND FOR THE DEN, FRANKLIN WANTS
A SOUTHWESTERN LOOK.

09:03.614 --> 09:06.617
YOU KNOW, NAVAJO RUGS,
RED CHILI PEPPERS,

09:06.617 --> 09:08.579
CHAIRS MADE OF HORNS.

09:08.579 --> 09:10.751
SOUTHWESTERN. FUN.

09:10.751 --> 09:14.655
AND BOUND TO COME BACK IN STYLE
SINCE IT'S BEEN OUT SO LONG.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.658
WE CAN'T WAIT TO WORK
WITH YOU, CINDY.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.591
YES. ALL WE NEED
IS A $5,000 DEPOSIT,

09:20.591 --> 09:22.733
AND THEN I WILL SADDLE UP,
MOSEY INTO TOWN,

09:22.733 --> 09:24.865
AND RUSTLE UP
THAT WAGON WHEEL TABLE.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.867
(chuckles)
WHAT'S THE DATE TODAY?

09:26.867 --> 09:28.639
OH, THE 13th.

09:28.639 --> 09:30.601
13th? NO, CAN'T BE.

09:30.601 --> 09:32.743
YES. WHY?

09:32.743 --> 09:37.708
IT'S MY WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.
22 YEARS.

09:37.708 --> 09:40.951
CONGRATULATIONS. 22 YEARS.
WHAT IS THAT--COPPER? BRASS?

09:40.951 --> 09:43.684
SEPARATION, IN MY CASE.

09:43.684 --> 09:47.758
OH. I'M SORRY. I SAW YOUR RING,
AND I JUST ASSUMED THAT--

09:47.758 --> 09:48.919
YEAH. STILL WEARING IT,

09:48.919 --> 09:52.763
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HANGING ON
BY A THREAD.
 YOU POOR THING.

09:52.763 --> 09:55.626
YES, WE'RE ALL DEVASTATED.
WOULD YOU LIKE A PEN?

09:55.626 --> 09:59.670
I REMEMBER WHAT MY MOTHER
SAID TO ME

09:59.670 --> 10:01.672
ON MY WEDDING DAY.

10:01.672 --> 10:02.873
IT'S BAD LUCK TO GET MARRIED
ON THE 13th,

10:02.873 --> 10:06.637
AND FOR 21 YEARS,
TOM AND I HAVE BEEN LAUGHING

10:06.637 --> 10:08.879
ABOUT HOW WRONG SHE WAS.

10:08.879 --> 10:09.940
NOT THIS YEAR.

10:09.940 --> 10:13.644
YEAH, MAKE IT OUT
PERRY-SCAVO DESIGNS.

10:13.644 --> 10:14.945
WELL, DON'T GIVE UP,
LYNETTE.

10:14.945 --> 10:16.717
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.989
YEAH. I THINK HIS GIRLFRIEND
MIGHT DISAGREE

10:18.989 --> 10:23.623
WITH YOU ON THAT ONE--
HIS BEAUTIFUL DOCTOR GIRLFRIEND.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.856
THAT'S P-E-R-R--

10:25.856 --> 10:27.828
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.830
MY FRANKLIN AND I ALMOST
SPLIT UP TWO YEARS AGO.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.662
HE WAS GETTING BORED,
AND I COULD SEE

10:31.662 --> 10:33.964
HE WAS ABOUT TO PRONOUNCE
OUR MARRIAGE DEAD,

10:33.964 --> 10:35.966
BUT THEN I SAID, "NO."

10:35.966 --> 10:37.838
"NO"?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.639
"NO." SPLITTING UP
WASN'T AN OPTION.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.971
I HAD WAITED TOO LONG
TO FIND THIS MAN.

10:40.971 --> 10:43.013
I WASN'T GOING DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

10:43.013 --> 10:44.675
SO WHAT'D YOU DO?

10:44.675 --> 10:45.846
I CHANGED.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.878
I GOT A NEW 'DO,
NEW WARDROBE.

10:47.878 --> 10:49.780
FRANKLIN LIKED
THE NEW CINDY SO MUCH,

10:49.780 --> 10:51.722
HE STARTED TO CHANGE, TOO.

10:51.722 --> 10:53.023
THAT'S AMAZING.

10:53.023 --> 10:57.688
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST SIGN IT. WE HAVE A STAMP.

10:57.688 --> 10:59.659
I WILL GO TO THE TILE YARD

10:59.659 --> 11:01.892
TO SEE IF THEY HAVE
THOSE ADOBE SHINGLES.

11:01.892 --> 11:04.935
YOU WANNA CHECK
ON THE FABRIC?

11:04.935 --> 11:07.768
DO YOU THINK
I FOUGHT ENOUGH?

11:07.768 --> 11:10.000
LYNETTE, YOU'RE TAKING
MARRIAGE ADVICE

11:10.000 --> 11:12.803
FROM A WOMAN WHO WANTS
COYOTE SCONCES?

11:12.803 --> 11:15.846
I'M SERIOUS. AM I GIVING UP
ON MY MARRIAGE TOO EASILY?

11:15.846 --> 11:19.950
NO! I THINK YOU KNEW WHEN
IT WAS TIME TO CALL IT QUITS.

11:19.950 --> 11:21.681
THAT'S JUST IT.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.753
I'M QUITTING,

11:22.753 --> 11:24.985
INSTEAD OF NOT TAKING "NO"
FOR AN ANSWER.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.017
LOOK, YOU AND TOM
TRIED TO MAKE IT WORK,

11:27.017 --> 11:29.689
AND YOU COULDN'T.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.762
NOW HE'S MOVED ON.

11:31.762 --> 11:32.893
AND YOU ARE AN AMAZING WOMAN

11:32.893 --> 11:34.965
WITH YOUR WHOLE LIFE
AHEAD OF YOU.

11:34.965 --> 11:37.768
SO TAKE OFF
THAT WEDDING RING.

11:37.768 --> 11:39.730
GO LIVE IT.

11:46.977 --> 11:49.079
HEY, GABY,
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

11:49.079 --> 11:51.982
OH. NOW'S NOT REALLY
A-A GOOD TIME.

11:51.982 --> 11:53.713
WHY DON'T WE TALK TOMORROW?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.816
OH, PLEASE. I DON'T KNOW
WHO ELSE TO TURN TO.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.087
SUSAN WON'T RETURN
MY PHONE CALLS,

11:57.087 --> 11:59.820
AND WHEN I WENT TO LYNETTE'S,
SHE PRETENDED SHE WASN'T HOME.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.023
(sighs) YEAH. OKAY.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.099
HOW DID THINGS GET SO BAD
SO QUICKLY?

12:09.099 --> 12:11.762
THIS MORNING, I WAS ALL SET
TO MAKE FOOD FOR POKER NIGHT,

12:11.762 --> 12:12.803
AND THEN I REMEMBERED.

12:12.803 --> 12:14.935
NO POKER NIGHT.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.938
I FEEL LIKE I'VE LOST
THE LIFE I HAD.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.110
FIRST, MY FAMILY
AND NOW MY FRIENDS.

12:20.110 --> 12:23.743
WHO KNOWS IF SUSAN OR LYNETTE
WILL EVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.816
THEY'LL COOL OFF ONCE THEY
REALIZE WE'RE IN THE CLEAR.

12:25.816 --> 12:27.747
(whispers) WHAT IF
WE'RE NOT IN THE CLEAR?

12:27.747 --> 12:28.819
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:28.819 --> 12:30.781
THE BODY'S 8 FEET
UNDER DIRT AND CONCRETE.

12:30.781 --> 12:32.122
NO BODY, NO CRIME.

12:32.122 --> 12:35.926
I KNOW, BUT... WELL...

12:35.926 --> 12:38.028
CHUCK CAME BY YESTERDAY.

12:38.028 --> 12:40.760
CHUCK? WHAT DID HE WANT?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.833
(groans)

12:42.833 --> 12:44.965
OH. HEY.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.967
BABE, DO WE HAVE ANY ASPIRIN?

12:46.967 --> 12:48.038
YEAH.

12:48.038 --> 12:50.140
(mug clatters)

12:50.140 --> 12:53.043
UM...
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

12:53.043 --> 12:55.005
MNH.
 (pills rattle)

12:55.005 --> 12:56.146
(door opens)

12:57.978 --> 12:58.979
IS HE...

12:58.979 --> 13:00.780
(sighs)

13:00.780 --> 13:02.012
I THOUGHT
HE STOPPED DRINKING.

13:02.012 --> 13:03.053
ME, TOO.

13:03.053 --> 13:05.886
OH, GABY, I'M SO SORRY.

13:05.886 --> 13:06.987
HE KEEPS SAYING
IT'S BECAUSE OF WORK,

13:06.987 --> 13:09.960
BUT I KNOW IT'S THE GUILT
STILL EATING AWAY AT HIM.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.892
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW DRINKING HELPS.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.093
I DO.

13:13.093 --> 13:16.927
SOMETIMES A DRINK FEELS LIKE
THE ONLY FRIEND YOU HAVE LEFT.

13:16.927 --> 13:19.099
WELL, I JUST THANK GOD
THIS ORDEAL IS BEHIND US.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.872
WE ALL NEED TO MOVE ON.

13:21.872 --> 13:23.173
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:23.173 --> 13:24.975
I'M GONNA GO.

13:24.975 --> 13:27.978
MM! YOU NEVER TOLD ME
WHAT CHUCK WANTED.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.942
OH. UH, WHAT ELSE?

13:31.942 --> 13:34.144
HE WANTED TO GET BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN.

13:34.144 --> 13:36.116
OH, GOD.
PLEASE TELL ME YOU SAID NO.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.818
OF COURSE I DID.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.820
OH, AND, BREE?

13:40.820 --> 13:44.154
NEVER THINK YOU LOST ME
AS A FRIEND, 'CAUSE...

13:44.154 --> 13:46.156
YOU'RE MY ROCK.

13:57.407 --> 13:59.239
OH! HEY, MARILYN.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.510
OH, MRS. SOLIS,
THANK GOD.

14:00.510 --> 14:01.571
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH CARLOS,

14:01.571 --> 14:03.513
AND IT KEEPS GOING
TO VOICE MAIL.

14:03.513 --> 14:05.445
OH, IT'S OKAY.
NO NEED TO BOTHER CARLOS.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.377
I'M HERE TO SIGN THE PAYROLL.

14:07.377 --> 14:08.518
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE PAYROLL.

14:08.518 --> 14:11.221
FRANK SWEENEY,
ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CLIENTS--

14:11.221 --> 14:13.523
HE'S ON HIS WAY HERE,
AND HE DID NOT SOUND HAPPY.

14:13.523 --> 14:15.355
I'M GONNA TRY CARLOS AGAIN.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.188
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WAIT.
(chuckles) I, UH...
 (receiver clatters)

14:18.188 --> 14:19.329
I DON'T WANNA
STRESS OUT CARLOS.

14:19.329 --> 14:23.333
HE'S HOME WITH THE FLU.
BESIDES, I'M HERE.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.265
HOW DOES THAT HELP?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.496
I KNOW FRANK SWEENEY.

14:26.496 --> 14:29.399
HE GRABBED MY ASS
AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY.

14:29.399 --> 14:32.202
ACTUALLY, A LOT OF GUYS DID.
THAT WAS A GOOD PARTY.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.574
YES, IT WAS.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.546
LEAVE THIS GUY TO ME.

14:36.546 --> 14:38.578
I KNOW I'M SETTING WOMEN'S LIB
BACK 20 YEARS,

14:38.578 --> 14:42.212
BUT I CAN DO THIS.

14:42.212 --> 14:44.284
(door opens)
 (singsongy) SO, FRANK...

14:44.284 --> 14:46.356
(normal voice)
IT'S BEEN FOREVER.

14:46.356 --> 14:48.618
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER?

14:48.618 --> 14:50.560
UH... I'M NOT SURE.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.223
I AM.

14:53.223 --> 14:55.625
♪ JINGLE BELLS,
JINGLE BELLS ♪

14:55.625 --> 14:58.228
♪ JINGLE ALL THE WAY ♪

14:58.228 --> 15:01.231
I-IS CARLOS COMING IN?
I REALLY NEED TO SPEAK WITH HIM.

15:01.231 --> 15:04.504
(scoffs) WELL,
AREN'T YOU ALL BUSINESS?

15:04.504 --> 15:07.307
OOH, AND ALL MUSCLE, TOO.
(giggles)

15:07.307 --> 15:08.508
DOES CARLOS EVEN KNOW
I'M HERE?

15:08.508 --> 15:09.539
I MEAN, IF HE DOESN'T TAKE

15:09.539 --> 15:11.441
AN $80 MILLION ACCOUNT
SERIOUSLY--

15:11.441 --> 15:14.314
NO, NO, OF COURSE
HE TAKES IT SERIOUSLY.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.585
(giggles)

15:15.585 --> 15:17.317
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:17.317 --> 15:18.448
IN MY MODELING DAYS,

15:18.448 --> 15:21.521
WE CALLED THIS
"THE MONEY-MAKER." (chuckles)

15:21.521 --> 15:24.294
WELL, NOW IT LOOKS
LIKE A NECK SPASM.

15:24.294 --> 15:26.396
LOOK, WHERE IS CARLOS?

15:26.396 --> 15:27.597
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF BUSINESS HE'S RUNNING HERE,

15:27.597 --> 15:30.330
BUT IF HE THINKS HE CAN PAWN
HIS CLIENTS OFF ON HIS WIFE--

15:30.330 --> 15:31.431
NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.633
WE UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN
A LITTLE UNHAPPY,

15:33.633 --> 15:37.567
AND WE... WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN HEARD.

15:37.567 --> 15:39.539
I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING YET.

15:41.411 --> 15:43.373
(knock on door, door opens)
 KNOCK, KNOCK.

15:43.373 --> 15:45.575
MR. SWEENEY, SIR.
HEARD YOU WERE IN THE BUILDING.

15:45.575 --> 15:48.548
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE BEING TAKEN CARE OF.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.351
OH, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.484
NO, NO, PLEASE, INTERRUPT,
WHOEVER YOU ARE.

15:54.484 --> 15:57.387
GEOFFREY MATHERS.
SENIOR ACCOUNT MANAGER.

15:57.387 --> 15:59.689
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE MARKET.

15:59.689 --> 16:02.292
I DO HAVE THREE OR FOUR
REAL-WORLD SOLUTIONS

16:02.292 --> 16:04.394
TO PROTECT YOUR MONEY
IN THIS ECONOMY.

16:04.394 --> 16:06.366
THAT IS, IF YOU'D LIKE
TO HEAR THEM.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.668
ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHAT
I CAME IN TO TALK ABOUT TODAY.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.541
WELL, OF COURSE IT IS.

16:11.541 --> 16:14.444
I WAS JUST GETTING TO IT.
(chuckles)

16:14.444 --> 16:17.407
BUT, UH, SEEMS LIKE GEOFFREY
HERE HAS A HANDLE ON THINGS,

16:17.407 --> 16:20.480
SO, PLEASE, JOIN US, GEOFFREY.
(chuckles)

16:20.480 --> 16:22.352
HAVE A SEAT, SIR.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.356
(Geoffrey) SO I NOTICED
YOU AREN'T USING DERIVATIVES...

16:26.356 --> 16:27.457
(exhales deeply)

16:31.461 --> 16:34.464
THAT WAS FUN.
I LIKE FELIX.

16:34.464 --> 16:35.725
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ANNOYING
WHEN YOU WERE CHEERFUL,

16:35.725 --> 16:38.328
BUT THIS SMUGNESS
IS MUCH WORSE.

16:38.328 --> 16:40.330
OH, WHY WOULD I BE SMUG?

16:40.330 --> 16:43.433
JUST BECAUSE HE CALLED ME
THE YOUNG YOU?

16:43.433 --> 16:49.509
GUESS THAT MAKES YOU
THE, UH... OOH, OLD YOU.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.511
HE CAN BE
A TOUCH THEATRICAL.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.483
I WOULDN'T TAKE
HIS PRAISE TOO SERIOUSLY.

16:53.483 --> 16:54.614
OH, I WOULD.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.717
I THINK THIS TIME I MAY HAVE
LAID IT ON A LITTLE TOO THIN.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.350
I HAVE NOT BEEN THIS EXCITED

17:00.350 --> 17:04.554
SINCE I DISCOVERED ANDRE
DOING CARICATURES AT THE PIER.

17:04.554 --> 17:05.655
THEY WEREN'T CARICATURES.

17:05.655 --> 17:08.458
THEY WERE IMAGES
OF THE AMERICAN GROTESQUE.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.601
UH-HUH, AND IF YOU BOUGHT TWO,
YOU GOT A FREE CHURRO.

17:11.601 --> 17:14.564
I AM NOT SURPRISED
HE DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT YOU.

17:14.564 --> 17:17.567
I'M SURE HE SAW YOU
IN HIS REARVIEW MIRROR

17:17.567 --> 17:21.511
GAINING ON HIM,
AND IT SCARED HIM TO DEATH.

17:21.511 --> 17:23.512
WHY WOULD
A PROFESSIONAL LIKE ANDRE

17:23.512 --> 17:26.646
BE THREATENED BY...
OH, WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?

17:26.646 --> 17:31.421
"A SILLY, BORED HOUSEWIFE
UNBURDENED BY TALENT."

17:31.421 --> 17:34.524
YOUARE A HOUSEWIFE?
 MM.

17:34.524 --> 17:36.456
(laughs) I LOVE IT!

17:36.456 --> 17:40.630
YOU'RE LIKE A-A SEXY,
SUBURBAN GEORGIA O'KEEFFE...

17:40.630 --> 17:43.563
WITHOUT ALL
THE PESKY VAGINAS.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.765
I CAN SELL THE HECK
OUT OF THIS STORY

17:45.765 --> 17:48.498
AT MY GALLERY.

17:49.699 --> 17:51.441
WHAT? UH, WAIT.

17:51.441 --> 17:53.643
YOU WANNA SHOW MY PAINTING
IN PUBLIC?

17:53.643 --> 17:55.475
WELCOME TO THE BIG TIME!

17:55.475 --> 17:57.747
NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT, UH,
NO, THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

17:57.747 --> 18:00.780
MY DEAR, DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY THIS IS?

18:00.780 --> 18:03.483
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
WILL SEE YOUR WORK.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.515
I'M SORRY.
I'M--I'M--I'M FLATTERED,

18:05.515 --> 18:08.518
AND, UH, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR OFFER.

18:08.518 --> 18:11.491
UM, BUT I CAN'T.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.592
(keys jangle)

18:12.592 --> 18:15.725
ARTISTS.

18:17.427 --> 18:18.668
MY PLEASURE, FRANK,
AND I'M SERIOUS.

18:18.668 --> 18:20.800
YOU CALL ME ANYTIME.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.772
YEAH, FRANK,
GREAT TALKING TO YOU.

18:25.575 --> 18:26.706
(clears throat)

18:26.706 --> 18:30.540
OHH. THANK GOD YOU GOT HERE.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.442
I WAS 30 SECONDS AWAY
FROM FLASHING HIM A BOOB.

18:32.442 --> 18:33.543
IT WAS NOTHING.

18:33.543 --> 18:36.686
CARLOS HAS DONE A LOT FOR ME
OVER THE YEARS.

18:36.686 --> 18:38.588
IS HE OKAY?

18:38.588 --> 18:42.452
YEAH, YEAH.
HE'S JUST GOT THE FLU.

18:42.452 --> 18:43.523
REALLY?

18:43.523 --> 18:44.654
'CAUSE HE USUALLY
COMES RUNNING

18:44.654 --> 18:45.855
THE SECOND SWEENEY
POPS INTO TOWN,

18:45.855 --> 18:48.698
AND I DON'T THINK
THE FLU WOULD KEEP HIM AWAY.

18:48.698 --> 18:51.531
UM...

18:53.863 --> 18:55.665
MRS. SOLIS...

18:55.665 --> 18:57.707
YOUR HUSBAND HAS BEEN LIKE
A FATHER TO ME.

18:57.707 --> 18:59.539
I REALLY WANNA HELP
IF I CAN.

19:02.812 --> 19:04.814
(sighs) OKAY.

19:04.814 --> 19:06.716
HE'S BEEN GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH TIME,

19:06.716 --> 19:09.749
AND, WELL,
HE'S BEEN DRINKING A LOT.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.622
SO HE'S GONNA BE STAYING HOME
FOR THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO,

19:12.622 --> 19:14.684
TRYING TO PULL HIMSELF
TOGETHER.

19:14.684 --> 19:17.727
THAT POOR GUY.
WELL, DON'T WORRY.

19:17.727 --> 19:19.629
YOU GO HOME
AND YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM.

19:19.629 --> 19:20.860
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THINGS HERE.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.792
REALLY?
 JUST GET HIM BETTER.

19:22.792 --> 19:25.495
WE NEED HIM BACK.

19:25.495 --> 19:26.696
THANK YOU.

19:26.696 --> 19:28.698
YOU'RE A GOOD KID.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:28.698 --> 19:30.570
I'M TELLING CARLOS
YOU DESERVE A RAISE.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.801
(chuckles)

19:33.673 --> 19:35.645
CAN YOU TELL HIM
WHEN HE'S SOBER?

19:35.645 --> 19:38.848
YEAH. (chuckles) YEAH.

19:38.848 --> 19:40.850
(knock on door)

19:45.515 --> 19:46.616
LYNETTE SCAVO?

19:46.616 --> 19:48.688
YES. WOW.
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.560
SOMEONE MUST BE
THINKING OF YOU.

19:50.560 --> 19:51.791
HAVE A GOOD ONE.
 THANKS.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.870
WHO SENT FLOWERS?

20:00.870 --> 20:02.872
UM...

20:02.872 --> 20:04.634
JUST YOUR AUNT RENEE.

20:04.634 --> 20:05.875
THAT WAS NICE.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.777
RIGHT?

20:07.777 --> 20:11.641
A LITTLE UNEXPECTED,
BUT VERY, VERY NICE. (kisses)

20:11.641 --> 20:12.812
(chuckles)

20:16.746 --> 20:17.747
(woman on TV)
BEAUTIFUL, SUNNY DAY TODAY...

20:17.747 --> 20:19.889
(lock turns, door opens)

20:19.889 --> 20:21.651
OHH!

20:21.651 --> 20:23.893
HEY, HONEY,
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

20:23.893 --> 20:25.625
(sighs) DAYTIME TV SUCKS.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.626
(turns off TV)

20:26.626 --> 20:27.697
JUST A BUNCH OF WOMEN

20:27.697 --> 20:29.559
SITTING AROUND,
TALKING ABOUT MENOPAUSE

20:29.559 --> 20:30.860
AND THINGS THEY DON'T EAT
ANYMORE.

20:30.860 --> 20:31.931
YOU DID RECORD THAT, RIGHT?

20:31.931 --> 20:33.733
YES.

20:35.805 --> 20:37.737
SO HOW'D IT GO
AT THE OFFICE?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.909
TOOK YOU A LONG TIME
TO SIGN THE PAYROLL.

20:39.909 --> 20:40.940
WELL,
IT WASN'T JUST THAT.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.672
PEOPLE WERE ASKING
WHERE YOU WERE.

20:42.672 --> 20:45.715
SO WHAT'D YOU SAY?
 I TOLD THEM YOU HAD THE FLU

20:45.715 --> 20:46.946
AND YOU WERE VERY COMFORTABLE
STAYING HOME

20:46.946 --> 20:49.879
BECAUSE YOU HAD A GREAT STAFF,
WHICH YOU DO, BY THE WAY.

20:49.879 --> 20:51.781
YEAH, WHO'D YOU TALK TO?
 BUNCH OF PEOPLE.

20:51.781 --> 20:53.953
UM, STEVE, MARILYN,
GEOFFREY--

20:53.953 --> 20:55.625
GEOFFREY?

20:55.625 --> 20:57.727
(chuckles)RIGHT.

20:57.727 --> 20:58.928
GUY PROBABLY STARTED
DOING CARTWHEELS

20:58.928 --> 21:00.660
AS SOON AS YOU LEFT.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.891
WHAT?
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

21:01.891 --> 21:03.693
HE'S A SNAKE.

21:03.693 --> 21:06.936
WELL, YOU MEAN LIKE A...
A NICE SNAKE.

21:06.936 --> 21:09.939
(tightens bottle cap)
 NO,LIKE A BACKSTABBER.

21:09.939 --> 21:11.671
HIS CONTRACT'S UP
AT THE END OF THE MONTH,

21:11.671 --> 21:12.772
AND I'M NOT KEEPING HIM ON,

21:12.772 --> 21:14.974
SO HE'S TRYING TO POACH
MY BIGGEST CLIENTS.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.747
(sighs)

21:17.747 --> 21:19.909
WOW. WHAT A DAY.

21:19.909 --> 21:21.751
I REALLY NEED A DRINK.

21:21.751 --> 21:23.813
HON...

21:23.813 --> 21:26.716
YOU THREW OUT ALL THE BOOZE
WHEN I QUIT, REMEMBER?

21:26.716 --> 21:27.957
OH, PLEASE,
THERE'S A BOTTLE OF CHARDONNAY

21:27.957 --> 21:29.789
IN THE TANK
OF THE GUEST TOILET.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.990
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW ME
AT ALL.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.892
(scoffs)

21:40.029 --> 21:41.030
LYNETTE, IT'S ME!

21:41.030 --> 21:42.301
COME ON IN!

21:42.301 --> 21:44.003
(door closes)

21:44.003 --> 21:45.505
♪ TA-DA ♪

21:45.505 --> 21:48.508
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT YOUR HAIR!

21:48.508 --> 21:50.079
DO YOU LIKE IT?

21:50.079 --> 21:52.382
IS IT PERMANENT?
 NO.

21:52.382 --> 21:53.513
(singsongy) THEN I LOVE IT!

21:53.513 --> 21:55.385
(normal voice)
ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS

21:55.385 --> 21:58.418
YOU'RE FINALLY READY TO PUT
YOURSELF OUT THERE AGAIN.

21:58.418 --> 22:02.452
NOT SO MUCH OUT THERE AS...
BACK THERE... WITH TOM.

22:02.452 --> 22:04.994
OH, LYNETTE.

22:04.994 --> 22:06.396
STOP IT WITH THAT.

22:06.396 --> 22:07.597
HE'S MOVED ON.

22:07.597 --> 22:11.330
THEN WHY DID HE SEND ME
FLOWERS FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY?

22:11.330 --> 22:14.063
"LOVE ALWAYS, TOM."

22:14.063 --> 22:16.436
WELL, I DON'T GET IT.
ISN'T HE SEEING JANE?

22:16.436 --> 22:20.410
YEAH, BUT... MAYBE WITH
THE ANNIVERSARY COMING UP,

22:20.410 --> 22:21.541
HE STARTED THINKING
ABOUT IT

22:21.541 --> 22:25.044
AND... HE WANTS TO GIVE IT
ANOTHER TRY.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.345
(slaps card)

22:26.345 --> 22:28.418
(sighs)
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

22:28.418 --> 22:32.351
WELL, I GOT PENNY'S KEYS
TO HIS APARTMENT, AND...

22:32.351 --> 22:34.053
OH, I GET IT.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.426
HE GETS HOME.
YOU MEET HIM AT THE DOOR

22:36.426 --> 22:39.529
WEARING NOTHING
BUT WHIPPED CREAM AND A SMILE.

22:39.529 --> 22:43.433
NO. I'M GONNA PUT A BOTTLE
OF SCOTCH ON HIS NIGHTSTAND.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.565
THAT IS
OUR ANNIVERSARY THING.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.137
HE SENDS ME FLOWERS,
I GIVE HIM SCOTCH.

22:48.137 --> 22:50.039
OH,NOWI GET IT.

22:50.039 --> 22:53.473
YOU GET HIM ALL LIQUORED UP,
AND THEN YOU UNDRESS HIM.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.104
NO, RENEE, NO SEX.

22:55.104 --> 22:57.076
OKAY, I DON'T GET IT.

22:57.076 --> 23:01.110
I WAS THINKING MAYBE HE SEES
THE OUTFIT, THE HAIR,

23:01.110 --> 23:03.583
AND HE REALIZES I'VE CHANGED,

23:03.583 --> 23:08.618
AND THEN... MAYBE HE WANTS
TO CHANGE, TOO.

23:08.618 --> 23:11.090
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT?

23:11.090 --> 23:13.122
ALL I KNOW IS WE HAVE BEEN
WALKING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER

23:13.122 --> 23:15.164
SINCE THIS THING STARTED,
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

23:15.164 --> 23:18.528
HE'S TAKEN A STEP TOWARD ME.

23:18.528 --> 23:21.471
I THINK I HAVE TO TAKE
A STEP, TOO.

23:21.471 --> 23:24.133
WELL... YOU LOOK...
AMAZING.

23:24.133 --> 23:25.435
(chuckles)

23:25.435 --> 23:26.576
I HOPE IT WORKS.

23:26.576 --> 23:29.178
THANKS. I DO, TOO.

23:29.178 --> 23:30.409
AND IF IT DOESN'T,

23:30.409 --> 23:32.642
I KNOW THIS REALLY HOT THING
YOU CAN DO

23:32.642 --> 23:34.514
WITH A DINNER MINT
AND A FEATHER.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.616
NO SEX.

23:36.616 --> 23:39.088
HOW ARE WE EVEN FRIENDS?

23:45.424 --> 23:46.626
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

23:46.626 --> 23:50.099
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT
GETTING ANY COFFEE.

23:50.099 --> 23:53.102
SUSAN, HANGING YOUR PAINTINGS
IN A GALLERY

23:53.102 --> 23:55.535
IS A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.666
LISTEN TO ME.

23:56.666 --> 23:59.509
I CONSIDER MYSELF A MENTOR
TO YOU.

23:59.509 --> 24:02.572
WHAT? YOU HAVE INSULTED
AND DISCOURAGED ME

24:02.572 --> 24:04.474
SINCE THE DAY WE MET.

24:04.474 --> 24:06.476
WHAT ELSE DOES A MENTOR DO?

24:06.476 --> 24:07.577
(scoffs)

24:07.577 --> 24:09.118
OKAY, FINE, YOU GOT ME.

24:09.118 --> 24:11.450
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
I CARE ABOUT ME.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.182
YOU CAME OVER
JUST TO TELL ME THAT?

24:13.182 --> 24:14.484
I TEACH TO SUPPORT
MY PAINTING.

24:14.484 --> 24:16.125
IF ONE OF MY STUDENTS
DOES WELL,

24:16.125 --> 24:18.187
MAYBE I CAN TEACH
AT A BETTER COLLEGE,

24:18.187 --> 24:19.559
LIKE ONE THAT DOESN'T
HAVE A MAJOR

24:19.559 --> 24:21.491
IN AIR CONDITIONING REPAIR.

24:21.491 --> 24:24.594
LOOK...
IF YOU TAUGHT ME ANYTHING,

24:24.594 --> 24:26.736
IT'S THAT THE ONLY GALLERY
THAT MATTERS

24:26.736 --> 24:28.467
IS THE ONE IN HERE.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.239
WAS THAT A TUESDAY?

24:30.239 --> 24:32.502
BECAUSE I DRINK AT LUNCH
ON TUESDAYS.

24:32.502 --> 24:36.706
I MADE THOSE PAINTINGS FOR ME,
AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,

24:36.706 --> 24:39.248
I'M NOT SHARING THEM
WITH ANYONE.

24:39.248 --> 24:40.710
YOU'RE SCARED.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.612
WHAT?

24:42.612 --> 24:44.483
YOU'RE AFRAID
OF BEING JUDGED.

24:47.216 --> 24:48.588
YEP.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.590
YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.762
I'M A BIG, OLD SCAREDY CAT,

24:52.762 --> 24:54.564
FEAR OF REJECTION,
NEVER FELT GOOD ENOUGH,

24:54.564 --> 24:55.725
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

24:55.725 --> 24:59.228
HAPPY? BYE-BYE.

25:01.571 --> 25:03.703
(exhales deeply)

25:03.703 --> 25:07.577
(birds chirping)

25:07.577 --> 25:10.209
SO DID YOU GET ME
THE PAINTINGS?

25:10.209 --> 25:11.711
NO, SHE STILL WON'T DO IT.

25:11.711 --> 25:14.544
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

25:14.544 --> 25:17.587
SOME ARE BORN GREAT.
SOME ACHIEVE GREATNESS,

25:17.587 --> 25:19.719
AND OTHERS HAVE GREATNESS
THRUST UPON THEM.

25:19.719 --> 25:23.723
LOOKS LIKE IT'S TIME
TO START THRUSTING.

25:36.305 --> 25:39.739
IF YOU'RE SPYING ON ME,
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.641
OH, I THOUGHT I WAS PRETTY GOOD
WHEN I FOLLOWED YOU

25:41.641 --> 25:43.272
TO THE GARDENING STORE
ON EUCLID.

25:43.272 --> 25:45.715
AND THAT STOP YOU MADE
FOR FROZEN YOGURT--

25:45.715 --> 25:47.577
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

25:47.577 --> 25:50.319
ISN'T STALKING ILLEGAL?

25:50.319 --> 25:52.551
WE COPS LIKE TO CALL IT
SURVEILLANCE.

25:55.284 --> 25:57.787
STAY.
I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU.

26:00.760 --> 26:04.764
THIS GUY--THE ONE YOU SAY
YOU DON'T REMEMBER SEEING.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.836
YOU THINK YOU MIGHT REMEMBER
SEEING HIS CAR?

26:06.836 --> 26:08.638
HIS CAR?
 YEAH.

26:08.638 --> 26:10.640
A SILVER FORD FOCUS,

26:10.640 --> 26:12.642
JUST LIKE THE ONE
YOU AND GABY

26:12.642 --> 26:15.605
WERE DROPPING BACK
TO HER AUNT SHIRLEY

26:15.605 --> 26:16.746
THE DAY I PULLED YOU OVER.

26:16.746 --> 26:18.608
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

26:18.608 --> 26:20.610
I'M SURE IT'S JUST
A COINCIDENCE.

26:20.610 --> 26:22.251
YOU WANNA HEAR
ANOTHER COINCIDENCE?

26:22.251 --> 26:25.655
THE MISSING GUY'S
FROM OKLAHOMA CITY.

26:25.655 --> 26:30.259
WASN'T GABY'S AUNT A BIG FAN
OF THE OKLAHOMA CITY RedHawks?

26:30.259 --> 26:32.692
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
PERSONALITY DEFICIENCY

26:32.692 --> 26:34.724
CAUSES YOU TO ACT THIS WAY,
BUT I FEEL COMPELLED

26:34.724 --> 26:38.267
TO INFORM YOU HOW UTTERLY
UNATTRACTIVE IT MAKES YOU.

26:38.267 --> 26:39.328
FINE.

26:39.328 --> 26:40.369
YOU DON'T WANNA ANSWER
MY QUESTIONS?

26:40.369 --> 26:42.732
MAYBE GABY DOES.

26:42.732 --> 26:46.275
YOU LEAVE GABY OUT OF THIS.
CARLOS HAS BEEN SICK.

26:46.275 --> 26:47.677
SHE HAS HER HANDS FULL.

26:47.677 --> 26:51.711
OH, I'M SO SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.683
WELL, I'M PATIENT.

26:53.683 --> 26:54.884
I CAN TALK TO HER LATER.

26:54.884 --> 26:57.817
BREE...

26:57.817 --> 27:00.349
I'VE BEEN A COP
FOR A LONG TIME,

27:00.349 --> 27:03.823
AND I CAN ALWAYS FEEL WHEN
I'M GETTING CLOSE TO THE TRUTH.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.855
YOU WANNA HEAR
A WILD GUESS?

27:05.855 --> 27:07.396
IF IT WOULD ALLOW ME
TO GET ON WITH MY DAY,

27:07.396 --> 27:08.828
I WOULD BE DELIGHTED.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.329
SOMETHING HAPPENED
WITH THIS GUY--

27:10.329 --> 27:12.762
SOMETHING BAD AND PERMANENT.

27:14.664 --> 27:17.366
NOW I DON'T THINK
YOU DID IT,

27:17.366 --> 27:19.869
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW
WHO DID.

27:19.869 --> 27:21.310
IT'S PROBABLY ONE
OF YOUR FRIENDS,

27:21.310 --> 27:26.776
AND YOU, BEING BREE,
ARE PROTECTING THEM.

27:26.776 --> 27:29.849
I DO PROTECT MY FRIENDS,

27:29.849 --> 27:32.651
AND I WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR THEM--ANYTHING.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.884
THEY'RE THE ONE THING IN MY LIFE
THAT HAVE NEVER FAILED ME,

27:34.884 --> 27:37.757
AND I WILL NEVER FAIL THEM.

27:37.757 --> 27:40.860
AND AGAINST THAT,
YOU ARE POWERLESS.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.432
NOW I AM TIRED
OF YOUR LITTLE GUESSES

27:43.432 --> 27:45.735
AND YOUR GAMES, SO IF YOU WANNA
CHARGE ME WITH SOMETHING,

27:45.735 --> 27:48.367
I SUGGEST YOU TAKE OUT
YOUR CUFFS.

27:48.367 --> 27:51.901
IF NOT, YOU GET THE HELL
OFF MY STREET.

28:04.754 --> 28:05.855
(car door closes,
engine starts)

28:05.855 --> 28:07.917
(tires peal)

28:21.270 --> 28:23.402
YOU SCUM!

28:23.402 --> 28:26.175
OH, NOT YOU, MR. SWEENEY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

28:26.175 --> 28:27.376
MRS. SOLIS--

28:27.376 --> 28:29.278
WE'RE SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING HERE.
 YEAH, I KNOW.

28:29.278 --> 28:31.180
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
STEALING MY HUSBAND'S CLIENT

28:31.180 --> 28:33.282
WHILE SITTING AT HIS DESK
IN FRONT OF A PHOTO

28:33.282 --> 28:35.444
OF HIS WIFE AND KIDS.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.387
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S NOT ME.

28:38.387 --> 28:42.121
THAT'S ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND...
IN BELIZE...

28:42.121 --> 28:43.292
WITH OUR DOG.

28:43.292 --> 28:47.096
WHAT KIND OF MAN PUTS HIS PHOTOS
ON ANOTHER MAN'S DESK?!

28:47.096 --> 28:49.398
OR TAKES HIS DOG TO BELIZE?
 (frame clatters)

28:49.398 --> 28:50.429
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT KIND OF MAN--

28:50.429 --> 28:52.131
THE KIND THAT SHOWS UP
FOR MEETINGS,

28:52.131 --> 28:54.203
UNLIKE YOUR HUSBAND.

28:54.203 --> 28:57.306
I TOLD YOU,
HE'S GOT THE FLU.

28:57.306 --> 29:00.439
GABY, I THINK MR. SWEENEY
DESERVES TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.176
FINE. I'LL TELL HIM.

29:07.176 --> 29:08.447
CARLOS IS A DRUNK.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.120
HE ISN'T HERE
BECAUSE HE DRINKS TOO MUCH

29:11.120 --> 29:12.281
AND HE'S UNABLE TO PERFORM
THE RESPONSIBILITIES

29:12.281 --> 29:14.123
THAT COME WITH THE JOB.

29:14.123 --> 29:15.284
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:15.284 --> 29:18.157
CARLOSWILLGET SOBER,
BUTYOUWILL ALWAYS BE

29:18.157 --> 29:20.359
JUST A...
LOWLIFE SON OF A BITCH.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.162
IS THIS TRUE?

29:23.162 --> 29:25.234
YEAH.

29:25.234 --> 29:28.367
I NEED TO SPEAK TO HIM...
RIGHT NOW.

29:28.367 --> 29:31.140
(sighs)

29:35.274 --> 29:37.446
(lowered voice)
CARLOS, CARLOS, WAKE UP.

29:37.446 --> 29:38.477
WAKE UP!

29:38.477 --> 29:40.309
(moans)

29:40.309 --> 29:42.411
MM, BABE, I WAS JUST
DREAMING ABOUT YOU.

29:42.411 --> 29:45.284
YOU WERE WEARING
THAT LITTLE BLACK NUMBER.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.486
CARLOS!
MR. SWEENEY'S HERE.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.158
(weakly) WHAT?

29:49.158 --> 29:50.519
(Sweeney) HELLO, CARLOS.

29:50.519 --> 29:52.161
MR. SWEENEY.

29:52.161 --> 29:53.392
MR. SWEENEY...

29:53.392 --> 29:54.493
YEAH.
 IN OUR HOUSE.

29:54.493 --> 29:58.227
AND I'M IN PAJAMAS,
COVERED IN CHIPS.

29:58.227 --> 30:01.330
(under breath)
HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON.

30:01.330 --> 30:03.172
(whispers) I'M SORRY.

30:05.234 --> 30:06.505
UM... LOOK,

30:06.505 --> 30:10.409
I AM, UH, REALLY SORRY.

30:10.409 --> 30:14.183
I HAD A ROUGH COUPLE DAYS,

30:14.183 --> 30:17.446
BUT I'M FINE NOW.
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

30:17.446 --> 30:20.319
YOU SEE THIS?

30:20.319 --> 30:22.351
14 YEARS SOBER.

30:22.351 --> 30:24.493
BUT THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN I WAS STANDING

30:24.493 --> 30:26.455
RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE STANDING.

30:26.455 --> 30:28.157
THE ONLY THING
THAT GOT ME BACK TOGETHER

30:28.157 --> 30:31.330
WAS ADMITTING I HAD A PROBLEM
AND GOING TO REHAB.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.203
NO, UH,
THAT'S NOT WHERE I AM.

30:34.203 --> 30:36.465
I MEAN...

30:36.465 --> 30:40.169
I KNOW IT LOOKS BAD,
BUT TRUST ME, I'M FINE.

30:40.169 --> 30:43.372
HMM, WELL,
YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF THAT.

30:43.372 --> 30:45.474
BUT IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO MAKE A CHOICE.

30:45.474 --> 30:47.416
EITHER THROW AWAY
EVERYTHING YOU'VE WORKED FOR,

30:47.416 --> 30:49.448
INCLUDING YOUR FAMILY,

30:49.448 --> 30:52.551
OR TAKE BACK CONTROL
OF YOUR LIFE.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.225
HONEY,
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

30:56.225 --> 30:58.327
I KNOW A GREAT PLACE--
THE PLACE I WENT.

30:58.327 --> 31:01.530
I CAN CALL TOMORROW AND GET
EVERYTHING SET UP FOR YOU.

31:06.495 --> 31:10.469
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
SWEETIE.

31:29.318 --> 31:30.559
(door closes)

31:39.398 --> 31:41.270
(sighs)

31:41.270 --> 31:43.502
(bottle clatters)

31:43.502 --> 31:45.434
(door opens and closes)
 (Tom laughs) I'M SORRY.

31:45.434 --> 31:47.506
THAT WAITER WAS
TOTALLY FLIRTING WITH YOU.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.278
(Jane laughs) HE WAS NOT.

31:49.278 --> 31:51.410
OH, PLEASE, HE KEPT ASKING YOU
HOW YOUR POTATO WAS.

31:51.410 --> 31:57.546
I MEAN, LOOK, IT'S A POTATO.
HOW MANY WAYS CAN IT GO WRONG?

31:57.546 --> 32:00.289
JARED WAS JUST
BEING ATTENTIVE.

32:00.289 --> 32:01.490
OH, OH, NOW IT'S JARED.

32:01.490 --> 32:03.652
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU TWO WERE
ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS.

32:03.652 --> 32:05.494
YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:05.494 --> 32:07.356
I LIKE SEEING YOU JEALOUS.

32:07.356 --> 32:09.328
I'M NOT JEALOUS. HE JUST SPENT
SO MUCH TIME AT OUR TABLE,

32:09.328 --> 32:11.260
HE SHOULD HAVE SPLIT
THE BILL WITH ME.

32:11.260 --> 32:12.401
JEALOUS...

32:12.401 --> 32:16.565
NAH. JARED ONLY GOT
TO BRING YOU A POTATO.

32:16.565 --> 32:18.367
I...

32:18.367 --> 32:20.639
OH!
 (chuckles)

32:20.639 --> 32:23.342
GOT TO BRING YOU HOME.
 (bed creaks)

32:23.342 --> 32:26.515
OH, STOP! STOP!
STOP, STOP, STOP! I'M HERE!

32:26.515 --> 32:27.616
OH, MY GOD.
 LYNETTE! WHAT THE HELL?

32:27.616 --> 32:30.349
OH, MY GOD!
 I'M SORRY!

32:30.349 --> 32:31.620
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
 YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

32:31.620 --> 32:33.482
I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T THINK--
I WASN'T--

32:33.482 --> 32:34.683
I THINK SHE'S ON A BENDER.

32:34.683 --> 32:36.655
NO, NO! I JUST...

32:36.655 --> 32:38.657
WHAT? YOU JUST WHAT?

32:38.657 --> 32:41.630
(sighs)

32:44.693 --> 32:47.666
OKAY.

32:47.666 --> 32:51.370
WHY DON'T I GIVE YOU GUYS
SOME PRIVACY?

32:51.370 --> 32:53.642
AS IRONIC AS THAT SOUNDS
RIGHT NOW.

32:53.642 --> 32:56.345
I'LL BE AT CHLOE'S.

32:58.507 --> 33:00.649
(sighs)

33:00.649 --> 33:02.711
PLEASE TELL ME
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

33:02.711 --> 33:04.653
YOU HAVE DONE THIS.

33:04.653 --> 33:09.588
I JUST WANTED TO BRING YOU
YOUR SCOTCH, YOU KNOW?

33:09.588 --> 33:11.520
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.322
ANNIVERSARY?

33:13.322 --> 33:16.695
YES. I GOT THE FLOWERS
YOU SENT ME.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.697
OH, MY GOD.

33:18.697 --> 33:19.728
WHAT?

33:23.602 --> 33:28.477
YOU... REMEMBER 12 YEARS AGO
WHEN I FORGOT OUR ANNIVERSARY?

33:28.477 --> 33:29.708
I FELT SO AWFUL,

33:29.708 --> 33:34.343
I PLACED A STANDING ORDER
AT THE FLORIST.

33:34.343 --> 33:36.685
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU GOT FLOWERS EVERY YEAR.

33:38.517 --> 33:39.548
OH, GOD.

33:39.548 --> 33:40.619
I'M SO SORRY.

33:40.619 --> 33:43.622
NO. NO. HONEST MISTAKE.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.494
IT W-WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

33:45.494 --> 33:47.756
I AM CANCELING IT
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.500
OKAY.

33:55.704 --> 33:57.736
I'M GOING TO GO.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.542
(sighs)

34:03.542 --> 34:05.744
LYNETTE?

34:05.744 --> 34:08.577
YOUR HAIR LOOKS NICE.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.621
THANK YOU.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.661
(indistinct conversations)

34:27.596 --> 34:28.737
YOU MADE IT.

34:28.737 --> 34:31.600
OH, FELIX WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO INVITE ME TO THE OPENING.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.601
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO.

34:33.601 --> 34:35.674
SUSAN, THAT'S ART.

34:37.806 --> 34:39.507
SORRY.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.783
WOW. THERE'S A LOT
OF PEOPLE HERE.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.784
YEP. AND BEFORE
THE NIGHT'S OVER,

34:46.784 --> 34:49.558
I BELIEVE THEY'LL ALL BE
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

34:49.558 --> 34:51.560
WHAT?

34:51.560 --> 34:53.822
I DID SOMETHING,

34:53.822 --> 34:55.864
AND YOU'RE GONNA
THANK ME FOR IT.

34:57.766 --> 34:59.498
OH, MY GOD.

35:01.870 --> 35:03.772
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD.

35:03.772 --> 35:04.833
YOU'RE WELCOME.

35:04.833 --> 35:06.705
(gasps)

35:06.705 --> 35:08.777
WHAT DID YOU DO?

35:08.777 --> 35:10.739
WELL, YOU SEEMED SO TERRIFIED
ABOUT DISPLAYING YOUR WORK.

35:10.739 --> 35:14.643
I FIGURED I'D RIP OFF
THE BAND-AID FOR YOU.

35:14.643 --> 35:18.717
AND SEE? YOU'RE A HIT.

35:18.717 --> 35:19.818
DON'T FORGET WHO MADE YOU.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.650
(chuckles nervously)

35:30.629 --> 35:32.661
(murmuring)

35:33.732 --> 35:35.734
SWEETIE, CAN I HELP YOU?

35:35.734 --> 35:39.738
NOPE. DON'T MIND ME.
I'M JUST...

35:39.738 --> 35:41.540
ADJUSTING THE...

35:44.743 --> 35:48.747
WOW. THAT IS REALLY
STUCK ON GOOD, HUH?

35:48.747 --> 35:49.878
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:49.878 --> 35:51.920
ANDRE SUBMITTED THESE
WITHOUT MY CONSENT.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.683
THEY WERE MEANT TO BE PRIVATE.
I REALLY WANT THEM BACK.

35:54.683 --> 35:57.756
OH, JEEZ! HOW MANY SCREWS
HAVE YOU GOT IN THERE?

35:57.756 --> 35:58.927
STOP IT!

35:58.927 --> 36:01.890
THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE COMING DOWN
IS IF SOMEBODY BUYS THEM.

36:03.632 --> 36:07.636
(gasps) FELIX, PLEASE,
PLEASE GIVE THEM BACK.

36:07.636 --> 36:09.768
NO ONE CAN SEE THESE!
(cries)

36:09.768 --> 36:12.701
(murmuring continues)

36:12.701 --> 36:14.873
(lowered voice)
OH, YOU ARE CLEVER.

36:14.873 --> 36:19.678
CREATING A SCENE
LIKE A CRAZY ARTIST.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.910
THERE IS NOT A PERSON
IN THIS ROOM

36:21.910 --> 36:23.682
WHO ISN'T LOOKING
THIS WAY.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.783
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

36:24.783 --> 36:27.185
NO! NO, I'M NOT A GENIUS.
I SWEAR.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.687
I JUST NEED THE PAINTINGS!

36:28.687 --> 36:30.619
KEEP IT UP. KEEP IT UP.

36:30.619 --> 36:31.960
I'M GONNA GRAB THE PHOTOGRAPHER
FROM THE "SENTINEL."

36:31.960 --> 36:33.862
THE CRAZIER, THE BETTER.

36:33.862 --> 36:36.665
OH, HER MIND HAS SNAPPED. OH!

36:36.665 --> 36:39.668
OH! (panting)

36:40.799 --> 36:45.734
(grunts) OH! STUPID ART!

36:45.734 --> 36:49.608
(crying)

36:53.682 --> 36:56.985
(panting)

36:56.985 --> 36:59.788
BREE, IT'S SUSAN. I KNOW
WE'RE NOT TALKING RIGHT NOW,

36:59.788 --> 37:01.990
BUT I REALLY NEED YOU...
AND GABY..

37:01.990 --> 37:03.922
AND YOUR CHECKBOOKS.

37:05.854 --> 37:08.827
SUSAN, THIS ISN'T ART.
IT'S AN ILLUSTRATED CONFESSION!

37:08.827 --> 37:10.629
(lowered voice)
IT'S LIKE A KID'S BOOK.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.661
"MEET DICK AND JANE.
SEE JANE KILL DICK.

37:12.661 --> 37:14.863
SEE JANE BURY DICK.
RUN, JANE, RUN!"

37:14.863 --> 37:15.934
OH, I SWEAR I DIDN'T KNOW.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.706
HE JUST TOOK THEM
OUT OF THE CLASSROOM

37:17.706 --> 37:18.907
AND PUT THEM UP.

37:18.907 --> 37:20.008
WELL, WE HAVE TO GET THEM DOWN
IMMEDIATELY.

37:20.008 --> 37:22.971
HELLO, LADIES.
ARE YOU ENJOYING THE ART?

37:22.971 --> 37:25.013
YES, SO MUCH SO,
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BUY

37:25.013 --> 37:26.845
THIS WHOLE SERIES OF PAINTINGS.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.877
AND TAKE THEM HOME
WITH US.
 IMMEDIATELY.

37:28.877 --> 37:30.949
UH, ORDINARILY,
I WOULD PLACE

37:30.949 --> 37:33.652
A-A STICKER ON THE WORK
THAT SAYS "SOLD,"

37:33.652 --> 37:36.685
AND THEN I WOULD CONTACT YOU
WHEN THE SHOW'S OVER.

37:36.685 --> 37:37.786
YEAH, WELL, YOU HEARD THE LADY.
WE GOTTA HAVE THESE PAINTINGS,

37:37.786 --> 37:39.728
AND WE GOTTA HAVE 'EM NOW.
SO HOW MUCH?

37:39.728 --> 37:41.930
WELL... OH. WELL, IF YOU'RE
GONNA BUY THE WHOLE SERIES,

37:41.930 --> 37:45.033
I SUPPOSE I CAN TRIM
A LITTLE OFF THE PRICE.

37:45.033 --> 37:46.965
$10,000 SHOULD COVER IT.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.867
$10,000 FOR MY ART?

37:48.867 --> 37:52.000
(gasps)
I MEAN, SEEMS A LITTLE STEEP.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.802
YEAH. SHE PAINTED MY KIDS

37:53.802 --> 37:55.003
A MURAL OF MONKEYS
PLAYING SOCCER

37:55.003 --> 37:57.706
FOR A BOTTLE OF WINE.

37:57.706 --> 37:59.007
FINE. WE'LL TAKE 'EM.

37:59.007 --> 38:02.050
CONGRATULATIONS,
MRS. DELFINO.

38:02.050 --> 38:04.713
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY SOLD OUT,

38:04.713 --> 38:07.055
THANKS TO THIS
LOVELY LESBIAN COUPLE.

38:07.055 --> 38:10.018
OH, WE'RE NOT--
 YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS NOT THE TIME.

38:10.018 --> 38:13.862
OH, WE'LL START PULLING
THE PIECES DOWN.

38:13.862 --> 38:14.963
I'M SO SORRY.

38:14.963 --> 38:17.896
TOMORROW I'M BACK
TO MONKEYS AND SQUIRRELS.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.768
YOU BOUGHT THESE?

38:19.768 --> 38:21.800
YEP. THEY'RE OURS,
SO STOP LOOKING AT 'EM.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.802
YOU REALLY HAVE
A GOOD EYE.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.904
YES. THEY'RE SO POWERFUL.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.837
IT'S CLEARLY AN ALLEGORY
FOR THE BLUDGEONING

38:28.837 --> 38:30.979
AND BURYING OF THE MIDDLE CLASS
IN THIS COUNTRY.

38:30.979 --> 38:32.711
MM.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.913
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

38:34.913 --> 38:39.087
ALL I SEE IS FOUR WOMEN WHO
KILLED A GUY WITH A CANDLESTICK

38:39.087 --> 38:41.720
AND DUMPED HIS BODY
IN THE WOODS.

38:42.851 --> 38:44.993
BUT THEN AGAIN...

38:44.993 --> 38:47.025
WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT ART?

38:54.503 --> 38:55.634
CHUCK, YOU FOLLOWED ME HERE?

38:55.634 --> 38:57.335
(lowered voice) WHY WOULD
HE BE FOLLOWING YOU?

38:57.335 --> 38:58.407
(lowered voice)
YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:58.407 --> 39:01.339
I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET A LITTLE CULTURE.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.342
SUSAN, YOU PAINTED THESE?

39:04.342 --> 39:06.545
Y-YES.

39:06.545 --> 39:10.649
BRAVO. THEY ARE... AMAZING.

39:10.649 --> 39:13.452
I-I MEAN, THIS ONE,
FOR EXAMPLE,

39:13.452 --> 39:17.355
I MEAN, I'M--I'M GETTING SHIVERS
JUST LOOKING AT IT.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.588
AND... IS IT ME...

39:19.588 --> 39:22.531
OR DO THOSE WOMEN LOOK FAMILIAR?

39:24.132 --> 39:29.367
AND THE SHORT ONE KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE YOU, GABY.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.139
AND, UH, THERE'S YOU, SUSAN,

39:31.139 --> 39:33.141
AND YOUR FRIEND LYNETTE,

39:33.141 --> 39:35.404
AND PRETTY ONE
WITH THE RED HAIR--

39:35.404 --> 39:37.546
WELL... (click teeth)
WHO ELSE BUT BREE?

39:37.546 --> 39:39.578
IT'S A WORK OF ART.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.680
I'M SURE IT'S OPEN
TO INTERPRETATION.

39:41.680 --> 39:45.484
NO, I'M PRETTY CERTAIN IT'S YOU.

39:45.484 --> 39:48.687
WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IS...

39:48.687 --> 39:50.158
WHO'S THAT?

39:52.390 --> 39:53.562
SUSAN, YOU PAINTED IT.

39:53.562 --> 39:58.396
YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHO THAT
DEAD BODY MIGHT REPRESENT?

39:58.396 --> 39:59.628
BREE?

39:59.628 --> 40:01.600
ANY THEORIES?

40:01.600 --> 40:05.604
MAYBE A CERTAIN...
MISSING PERSON FROM OKLAHOMA?

40:05.604 --> 40:06.635
(lowered voice)
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL

40:06.635 --> 40:08.437
IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

40:11.510 --> 40:14.713
I AM THIS CLOSE
TO PUTTING THIS TOGETHER,

40:14.713 --> 40:16.184
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:16.184 --> 40:19.748
I THINK I'M GONNA TAKE MY TIME,

40:19.748 --> 40:24.593
BECAUSE I WANT TO ENJOY
WATCHING THE ICE PRINCESS MELT.

40:30.529 --> 40:31.730
BREE?

40:31.730 --> 40:33.702
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

40:33.702 --> 40:36.505
ALEJANDRO--
SOMEBODY REPORTED HIM MISSING,

40:36.505 --> 40:37.736
AND CHUCK THINKS
WE'RE CONNECTED.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.568
OH, GOD.

40:39.568 --> 40:41.439
IS THAT WHY HE WAS
AT YOUR HOUSE THE OTHER DAY?

40:41.439 --> 40:44.442
YES.
 BUT I ASKED YOU ABOUT THAT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

40:44.442 --> 40:46.475
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
SUCH A HARD TIME WITH CARLOS.

40:46.475 --> 40:48.577
I DIDN'T WANNA BURDEN YOU.

40:48.577 --> 40:51.449
GOD, BREE.MORESECRETS?
(scoffs)

40:51.449 --> 40:53.752
WHAT DID YOU THINK
YOU WERE DOING?

40:53.752 --> 40:55.453
I WAS PROTECTING YOU.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.685
I'VE BEEN PROTECTING
ALL OF YOU.

40:56.685 --> 40:58.226
EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT,

40:58.226 --> 41:00.629
I AM THE ONE TRYING
TO KEEP THIS THING TOGETHER!

41:00.629 --> 41:02.561
YEAH, WELL, GREAT JOB.

41:05.534 --> 41:07.796
(sighs)

41:15.674 --> 41:18.476
THERE'S THE WOMAN
OF THE HOUR.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.748
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

41:21.510 --> 41:25.614
I NEVER WANTED PEOPLE
TO SEE THESE PAINTINGS.

41:25.614 --> 41:29.688
I FEEL... MISERABLE.

41:32.621 --> 41:34.763
THEN CONGRATULATIONS.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.797
YOU'RE FINALLY AN ARTIST.

41:42.671 --> 41:44.673
YES, THERE COMES A TIME

41:44.673 --> 41:48.777
WHEN WE MUST EXPOSE
OUR WEAKNESSES...

41:50.739 --> 41:54.783
WHEN OUR SECRETS CAN NO LONGER
REMAIN PRIVATE...

41:57.546 --> 42:01.519
WHEN OUR SOLITUDE
CAN NO LONGER BE DENIED...

42:06.524 --> 42:10.528
WHEN OUR PAIN CAN NO LONGER
BE IGNORED...

42:13.602 --> 42:17.566
BUT SOMETIMES
WE FEEL SO ALONE...

42:17.566 --> 42:23.311
THAT A WEAKNESS
WE THOUGHT WE'D OVERCOME...

42:23.311 --> 42:27.846
SUDDENLY BECOMES TOO STRONG
TO FIGHT.
