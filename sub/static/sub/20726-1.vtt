01:53.920 --> 01:55.035
Shit!

02:02.640 --> 02:03.868
Shit!

02:28.400 --> 02:31.392
We were invited to
Henry Grotsky's son's wedding.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.313
We got invited to
Henry Grotsky's son's wedding?

02:34.400 --> 02:36.231
Yeah. Why are you
saying it like that?

02:36.320 --> 02:37.640
Why am I saying it
the way someone

02:37.760 --> 02:39.216
who was just invited
to the wedding...

02:39.240 --> 02:42.232
...of the child of a guy
he barely knows would say it?

02:42.360 --> 02:44.237
We're going.
Mmm-mmm.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.376
This place will be fine
without us for a weekend.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.072
No. Not going.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.310
Jerry, you're
the president of idiots.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.510
Bina, you're the dummy
who voted me into office.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.955
Okay, impeached.
Too late. I resign.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.598
Ha-ha!

02:59.480 --> 03:00.993
I was first.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.597
This could be
a great thing for you, sweetie.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.512
Look, it was
at a friend's wedding

03:20.600 --> 03:22.670
that your dad and I
first got it on.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.788
Open the door,
I want to show you something.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.878
I'm flat-out naked
in here, so...

03:28.960 --> 03:31.793
Renzo Eckberg, your manhood
is nothing to be ashamed of.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.394
Your manhood
is a glory to God.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.471
Open the door a crack,
I'll fling it in.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.150
This could be how you meet
the love of your life.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.397
Girls are always so drunk
and emotional at weddings.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.948
Maybe that's where
you'll really shine.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.231
Should I start hanging out
at wakes too?

03:49.320 --> 03:52.118
Oh, let's see
how the wedding goes first.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.634
You got a letter
from someone.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.520
I'm pretty surprised
about it.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.600
I didn't know you knew
anyone in the free world.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.032
Good boy!

04:30.320 --> 04:32.436
Why, thank you, Ringo.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.554
Oh, my!

04:42.400 --> 04:43.833
Oh, Ringo!

04:45.080 --> 04:46.479
I, Francie...

04:47.320 --> 04:51.313
...take you, Douglas,
as you are...

04:51.440 --> 04:53.635
...to love and to cherish...

04:53.720 --> 04:55.870
...to have and to hold...

04:55.960 --> 04:57.757
...until death do us part.

04:59.040 --> 05:03.511
Frances Millner,
Douglas Grotsky, take hands.

05:03.640 --> 05:07.076
You may now kiss
as husband and wife.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.435
Two miles later,
we're almost there.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.354
Hi.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.914
Oh, my God.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.789
Shit.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.480
You look good, ladies.
Right here.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.549
I'll see you in there.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.440
Hi.
Hey.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.835
You're here.
That's c...

06:25.720 --> 06:26.720
Mmm-hmm.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.479
Why are you here?

06:30.440 --> 06:31.589
Same as you.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.832
Because I'm the best man
at my sister's wedding.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.148
Okay.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.478
So it's not
the same at all.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.076
Oh, my God, just...

06:44.160 --> 06:46.628
Give a
little bit of love to grow

06:46.760 --> 06:47.760
Have fun!

06:48.160 --> 06:49.160
Oh, shit.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.156
Don't you make me
beg for more

06:51.240 --> 06:52.673
Give a sign,
I need to know

06:52.760 --> 06:54.976
I wish I could be there
to be your wingman, honey.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.638
Whether you get
a girl to smile

06:56.720 --> 06:58.096
or whether she runs away,
it's all good.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.519
Gotta go, someone's here.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.315
Hello.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.838
I'm Francie Millner's
first nanny,

07:05.960 --> 07:07.075
Jo Flanagan.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.516
That's Jo with a "J" and an "O"
and no "E."

07:10.680 --> 07:13.672
I'm Renzo. With an "E"
and an "O" and no "J."

07:18.040 --> 07:21.669
You have an intense look
about you, Renzo.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.559
Thank you.
I'm working on that.

07:24.960 --> 07:25.995
Hi.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.195
Bina and Jerry Kepp, hello.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.192
Oh, Jesus Christ.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
Walter.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.159
Hello, Roger.
Nice to see you.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.560
Thank you so much
for inviting me,

07:37.600 --> 07:38.635
it really means a lot.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.836
Thank you so much.
I didn't invite you.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.189
Francie did.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.074
Okay.
I honestly thought

07:44.160 --> 07:46.037
they wouldn't let you
travel out of state.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.553
Well, you know.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.872
Hello!
Thank you for inviting me.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.393
Thank you so much
for coming.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.198
I don't think
we've ever been

07:55.280 --> 07:57.840
at a reception table
with a nanny before.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.114
Have we, Jerry?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.633
Only very good

08:00.720 --> 08:02.472
or very bad nannies

08:02.560 --> 08:05.120
are remembered
so many years later.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.278
Which one are you?

08:08.720 --> 08:09.720
You guys swingers?

08:09.920 --> 08:12.354
No, you're not. Right? No.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.280
Renzo, pick up the phone.
Renzo, pick up the phone.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.757
Did you not request
a singles' table?

08:18.840 --> 08:20.592
Because so far,
it's slim pickings.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.989
It was on the RSVP.
You put it there yourself.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.149
Pardon me.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.736
And how are you so sure
you're not with the singles?

08:25.760 --> 08:27.159
If there are couples
at your table,

08:27.240 --> 08:29.117
they could be
what's called "swingers."

08:29.200 --> 08:33.078
How well do you know the
bride and groom, Mr. Kepp?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.799
Hmm. I can smell
the toilets from here,

08:34.840 --> 08:36.559
that's how well we know
the bride and groom.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.110
Don't listen to him,
he's not a romantic.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.599
This is a great table.

08:41.679 --> 08:42.760
It's a great one.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.757
Mmm. No, it isn't.
Yeah, it is.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.229
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.594
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.874
Well, we'll see.
Okay.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.109
Hello. Sorry.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.196
Someone's sitting in that.
Sorry.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.430
Sorry. I'm sorry.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.635
Is this one okay?

08:58.720 --> 08:59.720
Yeah. No one's...

09:01.360 --> 09:02.873
My name is Walter.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.839
I can tell by your accent

09:04.920 --> 09:08.151
you must be a relation
to the bride's father.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.953
Close relation?

09:12.560 --> 09:13.560
Yes.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.675
Oh.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.269
Hmm.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.710
So what do you do,
Walter?

09:19.880 --> 09:21.916
What do I do...

09:22.320 --> 09:23.514
For work?

09:23.680 --> 09:25.616
- Leave it alone.
- Why can't a person ask that?

09:25.640 --> 09:26.709
Yeah, I'd like to know.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.028
Okay, then. Okay.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.314
She'd like to know.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.472
So, Walter,
what is it that you do?

09:50.360 --> 09:53.079
I am a successful businessman.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.520
Oh.
Okay.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.798
- Okay, then.
- Hmm.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.228
Mmm-hmm.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.197
What kind of business?

10:04.680 --> 10:06.398
Sorry, do you mind?

10:08.560 --> 10:09.656
So, forget the married people.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.715
Dance with the nanny.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.314
Hollywood marriages bust up all
the time because of the nanny.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.594
And you know what, Renzo?

10:14.680 --> 10:16.910
Even if she is a little older,
so what?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.576
There's something to be said
for know-how,

10:18.600 --> 10:21.239
experience and someone
who's seen a lot of things.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.834
You don't want somebody
perfect for your first dance.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.273
It's just too intimidating.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.799
You okay?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.159
No. Not okay.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.536
I could just see you staring
at somebody for a minute.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.313
Like a real, true minute which
is a long time to stare.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.016
Tells me you got something
brewing up here.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.393
Sorry, do I know you?

10:49.760 --> 10:50.896
Do you mind
if I say something else?

10:50.920 --> 10:52.353
I'm gonna say
something else.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.280
Nobody deserves a full
minute of your attention

10:54.360 --> 10:55.800
unless they're giving it
back to you.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.753
Oh.
Smile!

10:57.840 --> 11:00.957
Hey, just something
for you to think about.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.400
Me to you.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.839
You're welcome.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.351
Um, what the fu...

11:07.400 --> 11:09.038
- Hey!
- Sorry?

11:09.120 --> 11:10.997
Don't do that.
Do what?

11:11.080 --> 11:12.957
Just say something smug
and walk away.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.553
No,
it wasn't like that.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.496
I just saw you there, and I...
Yeah, well, it was like that.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.078
Also, in order
for you to know that

11:18.160 --> 11:21.311
I'd been staring at someone
for a real, true minute,

11:21.400 --> 11:24.358
you had to be staring at me
for a real, true minute.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.476
Also, that was a test.
Which I passed.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.239
My ex-boyfriend
is in there.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.077
And I...
You know, felt nothing.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.957
I felt nothing at all.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.350
Right.
So, I misread that entirely.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.829
Yeah. I guess you did.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.952
Sorry, I'm...
I'm having an off day.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.193
Do you ever have that?

11:50.280 --> 11:52.191
Kind of day where
you think that the things

11:52.280 --> 11:55.989
that come so easy to
everyone else just seem so

11:58.360 --> 11:59.839
elusive?

12:01.320 --> 12:02.389
No.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.158
Yeah, me neither.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.313
Okay.
Okay.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.033
Not that you asked,
but this is where I'm sitting

12:13.160 --> 12:16.436
so if you end up
in the high teens,

12:16.520 --> 12:18.317
you know where to find me.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.315
Shit!

12:24.240 --> 12:25.389
Oh, shit.

12:25.520 --> 12:28.796
Are you feeling all right?

12:36.160 --> 12:37.256
What do you say
your name is?

12:37.280 --> 12:38.429
Megan-Ann.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.078
Megan-Ann. Okay.
I will not forget.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.595
I should have married Leroy
while I had the chance.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.353
Leroy knew where
to put his hands.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.158
Ah, you're the killer, Nyung.
Don't deny it, you shit.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.073
It's hard to put down
a good book.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.431
Yes.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.872
Who doesn't love to read books?
I do, as a normal person.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.996
What's your favorite book,
Walter?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.393
Probably that one.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.599
Walter, where do you live?

13:33.840 --> 13:35.512
Today will not suck.

13:37.160 --> 13:40.516
Your nails are orange
and your hair is orange.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.151
And your dress is orange.
I say it's too much orange.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.039
Too much orange?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.994
That's what I was saying,
so you have to lose one of them.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.195
I meant the dress.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.633
Oh, my God.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.269
Where are you from?

14:03.240 --> 14:04.753
Hi.
Hellomygod.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.877
- Okay. Hi.
- Hi!

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
I am Renzo.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.036
I've achieved puberty
and I'm in a rock band.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.273
I'm Walter, I'm a successful businessman
and I've also reached puberty.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.673
Well, terrific.
I'm Eloise.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.035
So far, it's my mom on bass
and me on lyrics,

14:18.120 --> 14:20.270
but it's pretty cool.
Very cool.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.309
Uh-huh.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.914
There's No Bad Name
For a High School Rock Band.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.998
Is what we're
calling ourselves.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.274
I'm calling it "The Band."

14:28.800 --> 14:32.349
Eloise, what's your connection
to the bride and groom?

14:32.960 --> 14:36.032
Right, yeah, that's the sort
of question you ask back here.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.456
It's not gonna be
what you want to hear.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.840
It won't be
what she wants to hear.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.953
You're Jo Flanagan, right?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.553
You're the nanny.
Francie's nanny.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.755
How do you know that?

14:43.840 --> 14:46.400
And you know Henry Grotsky
from the diner scene,

14:46.480 --> 14:47.708
you're those people...

14:47.920 --> 14:49.239
Jesus, not the Klumps.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.355
Wow.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.509
The Kepps.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.113
- Bina and Jerry Kepp.
- Right.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.656
And I'm Walter,
just a successful businessman

14:55.680 --> 14:57.511
who just likes to read
his favorite book.

14:57.640 --> 14:58.709
That one.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.358
And you're
Grotsky's friend's kid?

15:01.440 --> 15:02.720
You requested
the singles' table.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.279
That was never
gonna happen.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.554
How do you know us?

15:06.480 --> 15:10.234
So, Francie, today's bride,
is my oldest friend.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.469
Oh... Thank you!

15:11.680 --> 15:13.477
There's been
a long discussion

15:13.600 --> 15:15.830
about what kind of
table this is

15:15.920 --> 15:18.229
and you've just
resolved it!

15:18.520 --> 15:21.080
She is the best friend
of the bride.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.195
Well, oldest.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.431
How close to the toilet
do you feel now, Mr. Kepp?

15:26.040 --> 15:28.508
The same.
The distance is the same.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.040
You know what?
It's the same wedding.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.355
It's the same celebration no
matter what table you're at.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.273
I'm a fan of
detective fiction, Eloise.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.112
Big, big fan.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.312
So when I find that something
doesn't add up, I investigate.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.595
Can't help being a detective,
it's just who I am.

15:42.680 --> 15:46.195
And you want to know what rank on
the force my husband has attained?

15:46.520 --> 15:50.115
He manages a diner in Columbus, Ohio.
That rank.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.719
Fill us in anyway,
would you,

15:51.800 --> 15:53.995
on how exactly
the bride's best friend

15:54.080 --> 15:56.514
ended up back here
with the Klumps.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.232
Oldest friend.
Leave it alone.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.550
No, that's fine.
It's not, it's...

16:00.720 --> 16:02.676
It's no mystery,
it's not a big deal.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.478
I got dumped
by Francie's brother,

16:06.560 --> 16:08.949
Teddy Millner,
the best man.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.788
That tall drink of shit
over there at table one

16:11.880 --> 16:13.791
you can barely see.
God, look at him.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.071
That guy is exactly
who you think he'd be.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.470
Yeah, just a selfish jerk.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.400
Which I somehow didn't see
until two months ago

16:28.480 --> 16:30.550
when he dumped me out of the blue.
Then I saw.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.520
So I dropped out
as maid of honor

16:32.600 --> 16:34.591
because it was awkward
and I RSVP'd "No."

16:34.720 --> 16:36.456
Well, "Yes" and then "No."
And then I thought,

16:36.480 --> 16:38.232
this is about Francie,
it's her day,

16:38.320 --> 16:40.176
and I won't let her brother
scare me away from that.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.952
I'm glad I came.
I'm fine.

16:42.040 --> 16:45.510
I feel nothing, actually.
I'm, like...

16:45.600 --> 16:47.750
I feel liberated.
I feel free.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.674
God. You have no idea
what that feels like.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.800
Someday.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.672
I mean, I am free.
I do, I mean,

16:53.760 --> 16:55.637
I'm a free man,
I do know how it feels.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.833
Right. Great.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.433
Well, then, you know.
It feels great.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.715
I don't have to think
about him anymore.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.792
Talk to him, or...

17:05.440 --> 17:06.474
Excuse me.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.395
All right.
Our newlyweds will be joining us

17:09.480 --> 17:11.435
for their first dance soon.

17:11.520 --> 17:12.635
Okay, what's going on, man?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.074
Meanwhile,
enjoy the open bar.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.519
Come on,
what does that mean?

17:15.599 --> 17:16.749
What does that mean?

17:16.839 --> 17:18.397
It means you leave me
a voicemail

17:18.520 --> 17:21.193
telling me to tell Francie
not to open your RSVP card.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.415
Then you leave me a voicemail
telling me that you're coming

17:23.440 --> 17:26.477
and then another one saying
"Disregard the last one."

17:26.560 --> 17:27.935
So that's what I mean,
what are you doing here?

17:27.960 --> 17:29.400
You listened to
all those voicemails?

17:29.600 --> 17:30.776
Hey, guys, right here.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.272
Come on, El,
please don't go all crazy.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.840
"All crazy"?
Now what does that mean?

17:38.080 --> 17:39.433
It means you get mad.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.829
You do something big
and you can't take it back

17:41.920 --> 17:43.273
and it's too late,
and then...

17:43.400 --> 17:44.880
Crazy. I do that?

17:45.040 --> 17:46.439
I do that?

17:46.640 --> 17:49.313
I'm not your mom,
so, I don't do that.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.274
I think it's funny, mostly.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.309
But not today.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.596
Nikki will murder me...
All right, all right.

17:56.720 --> 18:00.190
Nikki can calm down.
What is the deal with Nikki?

18:01.160 --> 18:02.160
Really?

18:02.200 --> 18:03.976
Wow. "What's the deal
with Nikki?" That's funny.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.833
Why would you care about Nikki if
you're just here for my sister?

18:07.600 --> 18:08.635
You're right.

18:08.720 --> 18:09.948
Yeah.
You're right.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.016
It's none of my business
if you cheated on me with her.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.951
What?
Why should it even bother me?

18:14.160 --> 18:16.071
Come on! I didn't
cheat on you with her.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.918
It started
after we broke up

18:18.000 --> 18:19.479
and you dropped out
as maid of honor.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.833
How does a guy who...

18:22.160 --> 18:24.276
After two years, you break
up with me over text?

18:24.520 --> 18:27.114
"Good luck with your
future endeavors"?

18:27.200 --> 18:28.360
Were you firing me?

18:28.400 --> 18:29.594
What the f...

18:29.680 --> 18:30.749
You're an asshole.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.438
Oh, my God,
you're such an asshole.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.829
You're a ridiculous asshole.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.357
Why don't you just go home?

18:45.600 --> 18:47.397
Yeah?
Yeah.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.910
Before you ruin
all this for Francie.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.616
I don't have a ferry ticket
till tomorrow, anyway.

18:53.640 --> 18:54.640
Swim.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.235
Think she'll be back?

19:07.440 --> 19:08.440
I vote yes.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.874
Hey! Let's chat,

19:10.240 --> 19:11.593
you and me.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.278
No, I'd like my
elbow back, Nicole.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.395
Fine.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.629
Just don't make a scene.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.029
Why does everyone
keep saying I do that?

19:18.120 --> 19:19.553
Hey, Jerry Kepp.
Uh-huh.

19:19.640 --> 19:20.834
Just a hypothetical.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.991
If someone offered you
20 bucks to go up

19:23.080 --> 19:25.469
to our room and read your
book in the tub, would you?

19:25.600 --> 19:26.669
Say yes.

19:26.760 --> 19:30.070
No. You know how I feel
about a hotel bathtub.

19:30.160 --> 19:33.869
People do unconscionable
things in hotel bathtubs.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.355
Okay, I'm sorry.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.720
Bina, stand up. Bina, please,
stand up right now, please.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
Why?

19:39.440 --> 19:41.670
I will give you
20 unhypothetical dollars

19:41.760 --> 19:43.159
if you stand up right now.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.559
All right, then.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.714
Okay?

19:48.360 --> 19:49.360
What?

19:50.360 --> 19:51.634
Honey.
Oh.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.040
Shit.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.559
What a shame.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.238
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.594
So much.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.594
How long have you
worked here?

20:02.720 --> 20:03.720
I don't

20:04.800 --> 20:06.631
really work here.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.240
Yeah. What's up?

20:10.120 --> 20:11.120
Look at that.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.038
That is why
I'm here today.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.795
Rodriguez & Hayes
must be overjoyed.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.395
Actually, I heard
they were fighting.

20:21.880 --> 20:22.949
Okay, look.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.918
Teddy broke up
with you.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.513
I know how hard
that can be, okay?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.795
A long time ago,
he broke up with me

20:28.880 --> 20:30.632
to go out with you,
so I get it.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.234
But you have to stop now.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.550
I fit into this family.
You never did.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.916
I was Francie's first choice
for maid of honor.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.555
I was Teddy's first choice
for a girlfriend.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.877
Sometimes, first sticks.
Sometimes, it doesn't.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.313
He listened to every
voicemail I sent,

20:49.400 --> 20:50.913
so what does that tell you?

20:51.880 --> 20:54.678
Tells me you don't know
when to stop calling.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.839
Hey, Bina.
Hmm?

21:14.960 --> 21:16.920
Make use of the jacket
and grab us a cheese plate,

21:17.240 --> 21:18.673
would you?

21:18.880 --> 21:20.438
That's funny.
Last week,

21:20.520 --> 21:22.476
I did a search history
on our computer.

21:22.560 --> 21:26.235
And one of us looked up
"Topless Dame Helen Mirren."

21:28.040 --> 21:29.234
Wasn't me.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.710
M-I-R-R-E-N.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.433
Why did you do that?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.073
Why did you come here?

21:35.240 --> 21:36.958
Jerry said
he wasn't coming,

21:37.200 --> 21:38.920
and then all of a sudden
he changed his mind

21:38.960 --> 21:40.279
and he won't say why.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.958
Since when does a man
need a reason

21:42.040 --> 21:43.792
to go to a wedding
with his own wife?

21:43.880 --> 21:45.871
See? He has
a pathological aversion

21:45.960 --> 21:47.552
to answering
a question directly.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.949
He always answers
with another question.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.320
Why did you make
Facebook friends

21:51.360 --> 21:52.918
with Henry Grotsky
on Facebook?

21:53.240 --> 21:54.753
You answered with a question.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.637
Why are you looking
at my Facebook?

21:56.720 --> 21:58.073
You just did the same thing.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.151
Okay.
Actually, with Henry Grotsky

22:00.240 --> 22:01.958
and Tom Fo.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.389
Tom Fo?

22:03.600 --> 22:04.874
Mmm-hmm.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.790
Well, Henry Grotsky owns
five diners in Central Ohio.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.912
We own a diner
in Central Ohio.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.435
Everyone who owns
a diner in Central Ohio

22:13.560 --> 22:14.993
is Facebook friends.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.071
You'd know that
if you paid attention.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.719
Tom Fo. Okay.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.992
Am I Facebook friends
with Tom Fo, really, Jerry?

22:25.080 --> 22:26.991
Okay. All right.

22:27.320 --> 22:30.232
Bina lost her virginity to a
loser immigrant named Tom Fo.

22:30.320 --> 22:31.719
He was from Canada.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.792
From the province of Canada that
produces the most insufferable people.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.440
That's not true.
Manitoba. It is true.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.514
Tom Fo is my first boyfriend,
and we loved each other.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.399
Great, I'll friend
my first love now.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.516
Helen Mirren
will be thrilled.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.520
Renzo, pick up the phone.
Renzo, pick up...

22:49.600 --> 22:51.272
Not now, big fight.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.635
Are you all right?
You look lost.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
I do?

23:03.120 --> 23:05.998
If you need help,
just ask us.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.712
Sorry, "If I need help"?

23:08.800 --> 23:10.950
Do you?
Do you need my help?

23:11.560 --> 23:12.913
Why would I need your help?

23:13.680 --> 23:15.113
Well, you have no one.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.118
I did the table assignments
with Francie.

23:20.200 --> 23:23.237
How could the person who did the table
assignments have no one else here?

23:23.320 --> 23:24.992
I planned half the wedding.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.240
Okay.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.392
Table one is Francie,
Doug and everyone

23:31.480 --> 23:32.696
who actually matters
including Teddy Millner,

23:32.720 --> 23:34.312
the best man-child
and Nikki Carmichael,

23:34.400 --> 23:35.576
the second-choice
maid of honor.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.656
Table two,
Francie's hideous dad...

23:36.680 --> 23:37.736
Roger?
No, he's a lovely bloke.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.216
Roger and his trophy wife,
and Doug's parents

23:39.240 --> 23:40.296
who are married but miserable.

23:40.320 --> 23:41.856
Table three, Francie's
disaster of a mother,

23:41.880 --> 23:44.216
her actual sorority sisters who
are all divorced, mostly twice,

23:44.240 --> 23:45.680
sometimes more.
What's happening now?

23:45.720 --> 23:46.936
Four, Doug's
kooky college friends.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.160
Five, grandparents,
no comment.

23:48.280 --> 23:49.616
Six, Doug's dad's
military buddies.

23:49.640 --> 23:50.914
Seven, decent cousins.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.336
Eight, indecent cousins
including Infamous Kate,

23:52.360 --> 23:53.496
the Millner family
nymphomaniac.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
Where is eight now?

23:54.560 --> 23:55.656
Nine, Francie's
scintillating work.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.816
10, Doug's even
more scintillating work.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.114
11, kids' table, no comment.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.496
12 and 13
are two tables of singles,

23:59.520 --> 24:01.096
one supposedly cool,
the other supposedly not.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.616
14, Doug's dad's
diner world connections.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.039
The hell are
we doing back here?

24:04.120 --> 24:05.336
15 are the wedding hires
including the reverend,

24:05.360 --> 24:06.536
the hairdresser,
the hairdresser's colorist.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.438
And then there's three more
tables until you get back here.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.096
Do you know what Francie's
mother calls this table?

24:11.120 --> 24:12.120
Enough.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.496
What Carol Millner
calls Table 19?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.376
The table that should have
known to RSVP regrets...

24:15.400 --> 24:17.336
...but not before sending
something nice off the registry.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.360
Enough.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.576
The table that could
disappear in the middle

24:19.600 --> 24:20.776
of the wedding and no one
would even notice.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.835
Enough!

24:22.520 --> 24:24.016
I did the table assignments
with Francie

24:24.040 --> 24:25.416
before I was replaced
as maid of honor

24:25.440 --> 24:28.637
because her brother broke up with
me over text after two years.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.312
That's the kind of
table this is.

24:30.400 --> 24:35.349
I told Francie Millner a never-ending
story when she was five.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.917
I taught her
a dozen rock-n-roll songs.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.993
I gave her, her favorite
toy in the world.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.789
A golden bird
that she so loved,

24:45.920 --> 24:47.990
I bet she still has it now.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.755
Does that sound like a person
they would put at a table

24:52.840 --> 24:55.354
of people
they don't care about?

24:55.840 --> 24:57.840
It sounds like someone who
was invited to a wedding

24:57.920 --> 24:59.216
because Francie's
mother found out

24:59.240 --> 25:01.629
she was paying $200 a plate
for the groom's nanny

25:01.720 --> 25:03.756
and wanted
to settle the score.

25:11.560 --> 25:12.834
Oh, and me too.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.512
I mean, I'm here too.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.478
Even though Teddy Millner is
the worst person I ever knew.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.593
I wanted to see if maybe
I was still in love with him.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.816
So, thanks for the offer but I'm
done looking for help from people

25:23.840 --> 25:25.398
who are as lost as I am.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.109
I'm Teddy.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.269
And I'm Nikki.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.668
I'm the best man.

25:31.800 --> 25:32.835
Maid of honor.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.360
Welcome
for their first dance

25:35.440 --> 25:38.512
Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky!

25:40.800 --> 25:43.439
Get this party started!

25:51.920 --> 25:54.434
See the people
walking down the street

25:55.320 --> 25:58.153
Fall in line
just watching all their feet

25:58.320 --> 26:00.880
They don't know
where they want to go

26:00.960 --> 26:02.916
But they're walking in time

26:03.040 --> 26:06.430
They got the beat
They got the beat

26:06.520 --> 26:10.672
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat

26:30.160 --> 26:31.513
Hi.
No.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.953
Of course not.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.392
Hello. I am Renzo
representing House Eckberg.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.153
Uh-huh. Okay.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.073
I'm Luke Pfaffler.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.953
Can I help you
with something?

26:48.560 --> 26:49.709
Mr. Pfaffler?

26:49.800 --> 26:51.313
May I have a word
with your daughter?

26:51.480 --> 26:54.517
Oh, this is not my daughter.
She's just my tablemate today.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.159
Can I ask what her name is?

26:57.640 --> 26:58.834
Megan-Ann.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.109
There it is.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.159
I may come to you one day

27:03.240 --> 27:04.878
asking for Megan-Ann's hand
in marriage.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.275
She's not my daughter.

27:06.360 --> 27:09.477
But today, I'm only going to ask
for her hand in this dance.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.950
And the rest of her,
along with her body.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.959
Good. No,
I don't think that's...

27:14.040 --> 27:15.359
You don't want
to dance, right?

27:15.480 --> 27:17.152
No.
She doesn't want to dance.

27:17.440 --> 27:20.113
Maybe I should have a word
with her actual father?

27:20.240 --> 27:21.355
He's not here.

27:21.560 --> 27:22.629
Same with mine.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.837
Okay, I think this
conversation is over, right?

27:25.920 --> 27:27.831
Because it started with
you asking for a dance

27:27.920 --> 27:29.717
and then the answer
to that was no.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.917
First, can I ask if she'd like to
hear about my extracurriculars?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.560
Okay. I'm gonna go out
on a limb here,

27:35.640 --> 27:38.950
Rezno, and say that she has
evaluated the whole package,

27:39.040 --> 27:41.429
including the
after-school specials

27:41.520 --> 27:44.592
and she's not really ready
to dance with that, okay?

27:44.920 --> 27:48.310
So you could just stand awkwardly
in front of another table.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.793
Oh, okay.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.791
Thank you
for the clarity of that.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.510
That was bracing,
so thank you.

28:00.960 --> 28:01.995
My pleasure.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.511
Would it matter
if I'm in a band?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
What instrument?

28:06.640 --> 28:08.198
Lyrics.
No.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.831
We got the beat

28:11.800 --> 28:13.791
We got the beat

28:15.120 --> 28:16.394
Well, that was weird.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.640
I thought we were gonna be
murdered there for a second.

28:18.720 --> 28:19.755
Mmm-hmm.

28:30.680 --> 28:34.150
Oh, my God,
the lighting in here is brutal!

28:34.640 --> 28:36.471
God!

28:38.120 --> 28:41.032
My dance number is next and
I cannot look like my hair

28:41.120 --> 28:43.315
just got humped
by a hurricane.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.919
Hello, Carol.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.718
I must look
very different to you

28:49.800 --> 28:52.314
since the last time
we saw each other.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.630
O-M-G! Oh!

28:56.800 --> 29:00.634
That's mortifying
that I would forget.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.274
Nanny Jo.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.991
Well, you've had
a lot on your plate.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.957
No, I am a Champagne
mental patient.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.439
It is inexcusable.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.112
No, it's fine.
No, it's not.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.394
No, it's fine.

29:11.520 --> 29:12.839
No, it's not fine.

29:12.920 --> 29:14.856
Oh, my God.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.996
All right. We have to catch
up one of these years,

29:17.080 --> 29:18.559
when my brain is
made of less liquid.

29:18.640 --> 29:19.959
We will die laughing.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.519
One of these years.

29:21.640 --> 29:25.030
My daughter is
a goddamn married woman!

29:57.800 --> 30:00.234
The funny thing is,
the bloke doesn't realize

30:00.520 --> 30:03.671
he's on the ninth green with
his pants around his ankles!

30:06.040 --> 30:07.189
Funny.

30:07.560 --> 30:10.677
This...
...is my nephew.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Hello.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.875
My name is Walter and I'm
a successful businessman.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.831
Nice. What line of work
are you in?

30:18.240 --> 30:20.071
I could ask you
the same question.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.275
Me?
Yeah.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.316
Oh, I'm in beer
and wine distribution.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.277
Same.
Oh, you are?

30:25.360 --> 30:27.191
Ever heard of a guy named
Donny Haczyk?

30:27.880 --> 30:29.393
Yes. He's a knobhead.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.112
- He's a what?
- A knobhead.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.679
Like a dickhead.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.274
I'm Donny Haczyk.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.870
Good to
see you again, Donny.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.592
And pull her close
and there, there, there

30:48.200 --> 30:51.590
And take your baby
by the ears

30:52.960 --> 30:55.633
And play upon
her darkest fears

30:57.640 --> 31:01.076
We were so in phase

31:01.960 --> 31:05.191
In our dance hall days

31:07.360 --> 31:08.588
Oh, boy.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.638
People do weird things
at weddings.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.358
What was I
ever thinking?

31:15.440 --> 31:18.238
It's so weird, one day you
can be 100%, the next...

31:18.320 --> 31:19.912
Are you hungry?

31:20.120 --> 31:21.997
Because there's a plate
of pigs in a blanket

31:22.080 --> 31:23.672
about to come
through that door.

31:23.800 --> 31:24.800
Just grab it.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.155
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.799
How did you...

31:28.960 --> 31:31.110
My sense of smell
is my best feature.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.280
Ooh!

31:46.920 --> 31:48.239
Was that a bread roll?

31:48.840 --> 31:50.273
Happy Anniversary.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.032
What's wrong with you?

31:52.280 --> 31:53.395
What are we doing here?

31:54.800 --> 31:57.951
What if I'm just here
to enjoy all of this?

31:58.320 --> 32:00.914
Huh? We used to dance, Jerry.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.956
Why can't I just be here
to reminisce

32:03.040 --> 32:05.713
on the early days
of Bina and Jerry?

32:05.800 --> 32:06.835
Please.

32:06.920 --> 32:07.989
I give up.

32:08.080 --> 32:09.195
Where's Mr. Manny?

32:09.320 --> 32:10.639
Mr. Manny?

32:10.720 --> 32:12.073
A lady at Table 4
says she tries

32:12.200 --> 32:13.936
to eat her own weight in
purple cabbage every week.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.296
How do I figure out if the kitchen
has that much purple cabbage?

32:16.320 --> 32:17.912
I don't know
why you're telling me...

32:18.040 --> 32:19.439
Okay, forget it.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.033
Take this. Take it.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.519
I'll find Mr. Manny myself.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.237
Oh, come on!
Hmm.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.668
I should go somewhere.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.279
Yeah, I mean...

32:32.360 --> 32:33.793
You should be
traveling the world.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.880
Hmm.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.616
I've never actually
been outside the country.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.870
It almost happened
after high school

32:38.960 --> 32:41.136
but I had to get a job answering
phones at a car dealership

32:41.160 --> 32:42.752
and my supposed
friends couldn't wait.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.840
So now I find myself
thinking that this guy...

32:45.920 --> 32:47.717
You, guy...

32:47.800 --> 32:50.473
...seem like the kind of
person who, in fact,

32:50.560 --> 32:53.438
did not have to get a job
at Lukazey's Toyota

32:53.520 --> 32:56.637
and has been to Europe
or some such

32:56.720 --> 33:00.030
and knows
where one goes to...

33:01.640 --> 33:02.993
To what?

33:07.280 --> 33:09.350
Oh. Well. Uh...

33:11.360 --> 33:15.273
I'd probably say this corner right
here is where I'd go for that.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.388
We have no past

33:21.520 --> 33:23.795
We won't reach back

33:23.880 --> 33:25.233
Keep with me forward

33:26.800 --> 33:30.793
All through the night
And once we start

33:30.880 --> 33:32.996
The meter clicks

33:33.080 --> 33:35.071
Ugh. I'm drunk, Teddy.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.953
Please don't let me
make a fool of myself.

33:38.120 --> 33:41.237
Mom, you could never
make a fool of yourself.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.749
You couldn't make it.
Not possible.

33:52.320 --> 33:55.278
All through the night

33:56.120 --> 34:00.671
Stray cat is crying,
so stray cat sings back

34:00.840 --> 34:02.990
- What are we doing?
- We're dancing.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.229
And also?

34:04.960 --> 34:06.678
Maybe making
somebody jealous.

34:06.760 --> 34:07.988
Okay.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.030
Sorry.
Bit too much?

34:11.120 --> 34:12.120
It's a little too much.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.512
You know,
this isn't really dancing.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.511
Oh?
Uh-uh.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.636
This is dancing.

34:25.719 --> 34:27.597
Oh...

34:27.679 --> 34:29.159
Watch it!

34:30.080 --> 34:31.080
What?

34:31.159 --> 34:34.947
Keep with me forward
all through the night

34:36.159 --> 34:38.355
And once we start

34:38.440 --> 34:40.748
The meter clicks

34:40.840 --> 34:41.909
And it goes on running

34:43.360 --> 34:45.828
All through the night

34:45.920 --> 34:48.228
We have no past

34:48.320 --> 34:50.833
We won't reach back

34:50.920 --> 34:55.755
Keep with me forward
all through the night

34:55.840 --> 34:58.354
And once we start

34:58.440 --> 35:00.829
The meter clicks

35:00.920 --> 35:05.789
And it goes running
all through the night

35:05.880 --> 35:08.348
Until it ends

35:08.440 --> 35:12.797
There is no end

35:49.240 --> 35:51.515
It was lovely
to dance with you.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.277
How did I not
just get kissed?

36:00.360 --> 36:02.316
It happens more often
than you think.

36:27.240 --> 36:28.240
Hmm...

36:29.760 --> 36:31.671
Uh...
I'm Eloise, by the way.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.034
Who are you?

36:34.240 --> 36:35.355
Huck.

36:35.440 --> 36:36.509
Huck?

36:36.960 --> 36:39.554
No one's really
named Huck anymo... Okay.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.871
Huck, we are in a grand
ballroom full of tables.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.712
I'm at the very worst one.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.678
Would you care to join me?

36:48.040 --> 36:49.075
I shouldn't.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.435
Sure.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.917
Oh, seriously?
Yeah.

36:55.640 --> 36:59.030
Oh, God, you're not
somebody's date in there, are you?

36:59.520 --> 37:00.555
No.

37:02.800 --> 37:06.156
Because you're not at a table.
You're crashing the wedding?

37:08.640 --> 37:09.868
You gotta stay
for the food.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.149
Oh, do I?

37:11.320 --> 37:13.056
Yeah, that's why people come
to weddings. For free food.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.433
Oh, is that so?

37:14.520 --> 37:15.520
Yeah.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.391
And to meet somebody.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.313
Hello? Hello? Hey, everybody.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.073
Best man.
Best man, toast time.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.832
Yeah.

37:28.520 --> 37:32.593
Yeah. Now, I got a few things
that I'd like to say.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.352
Well, it's hard to believe
any relationship

37:36.480 --> 37:38.596
that had its start at
McCormick's 80s Karaoke Night

37:38.680 --> 37:39.816
could possibly
amount to anything

37:39.840 --> 37:41.956
more than a one-night
stand...

37:42.560 --> 37:46.269
...but it did and here
we are and it's perfect.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.953
I guess, you know,
to all those who

37:52.120 --> 37:53.599
want to see how it's done,

37:53.680 --> 37:56.592
how people can and should be
there for each other,

37:56.680 --> 37:58.796
look no further
than table one.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.336
You're a better couple
than we've seen

38:00.360 --> 38:02.078
in our family in a long,
long time.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.310
So, yeah,
in honor of that

38:04.400 --> 38:07.233
I've got a few things
I'd like to say about love.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.496
This friend of mine, Clarence,
once stood up during lunch period

38:09.520 --> 38:11.750
and said he had something
to say about love.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.796
Then he took a dump
on the table.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.474
When Francie
first met Doug,

38:16.760 --> 38:20.196
she just always knew
that he'd never let her down.

38:21.720 --> 38:22.948
But I thought

38:23.760 --> 38:26.354
people almost
always let you down,

38:27.040 --> 38:28.951
so where did that
come from?

38:31.360 --> 38:33.430
Maybe she realized that

38:34.800 --> 38:37.075
whenever he did
let her down,

38:38.400 --> 38:41.995
maybe she'd just be always
ready to forgive him.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.957
Whoo!

38:47.000 --> 38:48.433
Come on up here, Nikki.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.830
Save me, please.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.956
I don't know
what I'm saying anymore.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.393
Maid of honor toast time!

39:04.920 --> 39:05.920
Oh...

39:09.600 --> 39:10.669
Let's go.

39:10.760 --> 39:11.760
What?

39:11.800 --> 39:13.233
She's none of
our business.

39:13.320 --> 39:16.232
Who knows what that girl
will do to herself?

39:16.320 --> 39:18.629
We don't, because we don't
know anything about her.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.416
She's temperamental.
She hasn't had a drink

39:20.440 --> 39:22.635
and now she's puked up
mini hotdogs.

39:22.880 --> 39:26.873
Do none of you care that that
girl is obviously pregnant?

39:26.960 --> 39:28.313
What?
Huh?

39:28.400 --> 39:31.437
You children are
such a disappointment.

39:34.920 --> 39:36.638
Go away, please.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.359
You're right.
Teddy Millner was always rotten.

39:39.480 --> 39:40.549
You don't know me.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.757
No, he was selfish,
rude, mumbling.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.114
Always mumbling.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.873
In love with whatever toy
his mother got him

39:47.960 --> 39:49.552
until she got him
a new one

39:49.640 --> 39:51.278
and then he just
moved right on.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.713
Please go away. Please.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.870
I got his sister Francie
a bird that I found

39:54.960 --> 39:57.872
at a Chinese gift store
in New York City.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.916
Well, Teddy got jealous.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.951
So the next time
I was in New York,

40:02.040 --> 40:03.951
I went out of my way,

40:04.040 --> 40:05.712
skipped a blind date

40:05.840 --> 40:07.637
my aunt tried
to set me up on...

40:07.720 --> 40:09.358
Please get out.
...skipped a date,

40:09.440 --> 40:13.069
to find Teddy the same
bird his sister cherished.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.594
Well, he played with it
for one day!

40:15.680 --> 40:17.910
I never saw the bird again.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.752
My whole life
might have been

40:19.840 --> 40:22.479
something else
if I'd gone on that date.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.198
But what's done is done.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.953
No. Wait.
I know what happened.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.477
He ended it
with a text message

40:29.560 --> 40:31.596
when you told him
you were pregnant.

40:33.520 --> 40:34.520
Oh...

40:35.960 --> 40:37.154
Jesus!

40:37.240 --> 40:39.629
Never doubt
a nanny's intuition.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.039
It's true?
Yes.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.536
Can everybody just
get out of here, please?

40:42.560 --> 40:43.560
So what do we do?

40:43.640 --> 40:44.696
What do you mean,
"What do we do?"

40:44.720 --> 40:46.551
To teach that asshole a lesson.
Oh, Lord.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.120
No, I don't want to do anything
that will jeopardize my freedom

40:49.200 --> 40:51.395
to run my
successful business.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.232
That's right.
Let's just please go back

40:53.320 --> 40:54.816
to the table before
they think we've left.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.751
What do you care what
anyone here thinks, Bina?

40:56.840 --> 40:59.308
Stop. That was
an overreaction, okay?

40:59.400 --> 41:01.675
I had too many of
the mini hotdogs and...

41:02.040 --> 41:03.314
Can we just
forget about it?

41:03.400 --> 41:04.469
That won't be easy.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.437
Teddy Millner
is leaving you

41:06.520 --> 41:09.478
to raise a child alone.
If you even go...

41:09.880 --> 41:11.598
Oh, my God.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.830
If you even go through
with the pregnancy.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.990
Okay, no. This is
no one's business, okay?

41:16.080 --> 41:17.274
We're going back
to the table.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.078
Let's get out of
the ladies' bathroom.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.376
Francie's still my friend,
and I'm not gonna mess up her day

41:21.400 --> 41:22.856
by doing something
to her dumb brother.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.359
What if Francie
never needs to know?

41:24.440 --> 41:27.113
Jerry, stop.
She said she's done with it.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.197
Well, no.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.776
No. For once, I'm not gonna do
the thing I immediately regret.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.376
Renzo, if I gave you
a couple hundred bucks,

41:33.400 --> 41:34.736
could you get a hooker
to wait in Teddy's room?

41:34.760 --> 41:37.096
Oh, I was asking the hotel that very
same question about my own room.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.456
I don't want to get
involved with hookers.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.480
They don't provide them.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.616
You guys probably already know this,
but that's not a question

41:41.640 --> 41:42.936
you're supposed to ask
a fancy place like this

41:42.960 --> 41:44.480
unless you're
a successful businessman.

41:44.560 --> 41:45.629
Which I am.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.676
Are you okay?
You looked like you got sick.

41:47.760 --> 41:48.976
I'm fine. Please get lost.
Excuse me.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.513
Hello. Jerry Kepp.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.431
Diner associate
on the Grotsky side.

41:52.560 --> 41:53.560
Hello.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.040
Did you or did you not
dump this girl

41:55.080 --> 41:56.672
after getting her pregnant?
Oh, my God.

41:56.760 --> 41:59.194
I'm sorry, what's going
on now? I'm just...

41:59.280 --> 42:01.271
I never did like you,
not even as a child.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.317
Teddy Millner, did you dump
this girl immediately

42:05.400 --> 42:07.675
after she told you
she was pregnant?

42:07.760 --> 42:08.760
Okay.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.096
You didn't tell them
what you said.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.350
Wait, what did you say?
What did I say?

42:12.440 --> 42:15.193
She said that we'd be
ridiculous parents.

42:16.560 --> 42:17.879
No, I... Not like that.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.075
Yes, you did.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.594
You said I'd be
a ridiculous father.

42:21.680 --> 42:23.557
You asked me
if I wanted to keep it.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.074
Then I asked you if you
would want to keep it

42:26.160 --> 42:28.230
and you didn't say
anything to that.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.629
So then I said
we were ridiculous.

42:30.720 --> 42:33.188
It was after
you called me ridiculous

42:33.320 --> 42:37.074
because why would you
want to keep our kid

42:37.200 --> 42:39.794
if you thought
that I was just a...

42:39.880 --> 42:41.518
That I was just a joke?

42:41.720 --> 42:43.438
It was before.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.590
And you were looking
for a way out, man!

42:45.680 --> 42:46.715
I get that now.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.560
Everyone we know says
we were wrong together.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.392
Your mother wouldn't
stop saying that

42:50.480 --> 42:53.153
I was not the kind of girl
who ended up with you.

42:53.480 --> 42:56.153
And when it was time for you to
stand up and say that she's wrong

42:56.240 --> 42:58.913
and they're all wrong and
they're idiots and stand by me,

42:59.000 --> 43:02.037
then you ask me
if I want to keep it.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.671
That's your first question.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.269
What was I supposed
to say, El?

43:14.520 --> 43:16.670
I constantly disappoint you.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.037
Then you tell me
that you think our kid

43:20.120 --> 43:22.839
will grow up thinking
that I'm just a joke.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.675
That I was never
good enough for you.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.039
And you finally found
a way to tell me.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.190
And I was so scared
of losing you that

43:35.280 --> 43:37.396
when you told me
you were pregnant,

43:37.480 --> 43:40.040
I asked if you
wanted to keep the kid.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.236
I'm ridiculous
in a million ways.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.038
I am. I know that.

43:49.600 --> 43:52.194
But I can't spend
my whole life

43:54.360 --> 43:56.032
disappointing you

43:56.120 --> 43:58.429
as much as
I disappoint myself.

44:00.440 --> 44:01.634
Shit.

44:02.840 --> 44:04.034
I'm sorry.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.839
Hey, stop.

44:09.880 --> 44:12.155
Teddy! Stop! Teddy!

44:12.240 --> 44:13.468
Leave me alone.

44:13.560 --> 44:15.596
No, Teddy!
No, he doesn't get...

44:17.880 --> 44:19.313
Oh.

44:20.800 --> 44:21.835
Oh, my God.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.990
No, we can fix this.
We can fix this. No, Teddy.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.195
Oh!

44:26.320 --> 44:27.594
Oh! I'm sorry.

44:27.720 --> 44:29.039
I've been hit.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.034
- Oh...
- Shit.

44:34.240 --> 44:35.798
Oh, my God.

44:35.880 --> 44:36.880
Oh...

44:37.440 --> 44:38.634
Oh, shit.

44:41.760 --> 44:42.875
Oh, my God.

44:48.400 --> 44:49.799
But I'm ridiculous?

44:58.680 --> 45:00.159
Shake it up

45:01.680 --> 45:02.954
Thank you.

45:05.640 --> 45:06.914
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.038
Let's go. Thank you.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.633
Shake it up

45:11.040 --> 45:12.792
Shake it up

45:14.200 --> 45:15.952
Yeah, shake it up

45:25.960 --> 45:27.029
Oh...

45:29.400 --> 45:31.789
You want me to call Mr. Manny
on these people?

45:46.840 --> 45:49.229
I have a confession to make.

45:50.240 --> 45:53.038
I'm not actually
a successful businessman.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.514
I was in prison
because I stole

45:56.600 --> 45:59.990
$125,000 from
the father of the bride.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.992
It was not
a table of honor.

46:11.520 --> 46:14.751
I have a bag of dope
in my room.

46:14.840 --> 46:17.559
Room 115 for the dope

46:17.640 --> 46:19.278
in case
any of you feel that

46:19.360 --> 46:22.193
a bag of dope
would be fun to do.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.793
Not you.

46:24.880 --> 46:25.949
And not you.

46:26.040 --> 46:31.273
You two can drop by and choose
something from the mini fridge.

46:31.360 --> 46:35.353
That was the worst invitation to
anything I've ever received, ever.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.478
Is your room this way?

46:42.560 --> 46:44.152
Or are you just
following us?

46:44.280 --> 46:46.589
Who, me?
Just following.

46:49.080 --> 46:52.550
Honestly, it still sounds
better than junior prom, honey.

46:52.640 --> 46:53.959
Junior prom is a horror show.

46:54.080 --> 46:56.720
Well, if the thinking was for me
to see people at their most happy,

46:56.760 --> 47:00.435
I would have to say that seems
to be a huge miscalculation.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.595
Did you just break
another chair?

47:50.840 --> 47:52.876
What kind of
nanny are you?

47:52.960 --> 47:54.359
Retired.

47:58.800 --> 48:01.155
Wow, the last time
Jerry and I did this

48:01.240 --> 48:03.629
was the last time
Jerry and I had sex.

48:03.840 --> 48:06.354
Three... Actually,
over three years ago.

48:06.640 --> 48:08.517
But no one's counting.

48:08.800 --> 48:09.800
Oh, thank you.

48:19.320 --> 48:21.356
You don't have
to do this.

48:22.440 --> 48:24.556
It might be best.
If Uncle Roger finds out,

48:24.640 --> 48:26.631
he might tell
my parole officer

48:26.720 --> 48:28.392
and then they'd
send me back to jail

48:28.480 --> 48:30.550
or extend my time
at the halfway house.

48:30.640 --> 48:33.074
I share a room with a man
called Jalapeno

48:33.160 --> 48:34.878
who has a smiley
face tattooed

48:34.960 --> 48:37.076
on the end of his penis
so that when he pees

48:37.160 --> 48:39.071
it looks like
it's vomiting sunshine.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.835
He's not as sweet
as he sounds.

48:44.440 --> 48:46.032
Well, then
you shouldn't do it.

48:46.120 --> 48:49.192
Jalapeno doesn't sound like
a good roommate.

48:50.040 --> 48:51.234
No.

48:53.120 --> 48:54.519
I don't know,
unless Uncle Roger

48:54.600 --> 48:56.800
is lurking around outside the door,
I mean...

49:06.800 --> 49:08.870
Is it Uncle Roger?
Nope.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.520
Hi.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.111
I just wanted
to say sorry.

49:18.040 --> 49:19.234
I take things too far.

49:20.320 --> 49:22.151
Usually, I'm the only
one who gets hurt,

49:22.240 --> 49:25.118
but it didn't work out like
that today, so I'm sorry.

49:27.200 --> 49:28.235
Join us.

49:28.360 --> 49:30.874
Or do you have
somewhere else to be?

49:31.440 --> 49:32.555
No.

49:38.440 --> 49:41.637
You know, a whole table
disappeared from a wedding

49:42.400 --> 49:45.472
and I bet
no one even knows.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.471
We can go anywhere,
do anything.

49:47.560 --> 49:49.118
The day is ours.

49:49.560 --> 49:52.757
Hello. My name is Walter
and I'm a successful pothead.

49:55.560 --> 49:58.154
I'm smoking the reefer.

49:58.240 --> 50:00.196
Who smokes pot?
Are you a potter?

50:00.280 --> 50:01.918
- No.
- No?

50:02.080 --> 50:04.275
You're a pothead.

50:04.800 --> 50:07.160
You got a table
with a lot of your friends

50:07.240 --> 50:08.992
Waitin' for your ship
to come in

50:09.080 --> 50:12.311
Folks like me on the job
from nine to five

50:13.000 --> 50:14.831
Concierge, please.

50:22.960 --> 50:24.029
Hi.

50:24.280 --> 50:28.273
Um, can you tell me
when the next ferry arrives?

50:28.520 --> 50:30.476
In about 30 minutes.
Okay. Thanks.

50:32.880 --> 50:34.791
There's a dog
in your bathtub.

50:35.920 --> 50:38.229
See? That's what I
mean about hotel bathtubs.

50:39.640 --> 50:42.791
You know, marriage is
till death do us part.

50:42.960 --> 50:46.191
What does that mean?
Does that mean you're gonna get to heaven

50:46.280 --> 50:47.838
and then you'll be single,

50:47.920 --> 50:50.434
and then do whatever
you want at that point?

50:50.520 --> 50:51.555
Maybe.

50:51.640 --> 50:54.200
Nobody knows
what happens after you die.

50:54.320 --> 50:56.959
You are Romeo and Juliet

50:57.120 --> 51:00.192
and we all wish you
the same happy ending.

51:00.280 --> 51:02.396
Congratulations,
and best of luck.

51:02.560 --> 51:05.472
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a magician.

51:05.760 --> 51:08.718
I always wanted to be
a nightclub singer.

51:09.680 --> 51:11.272
Fiction writer.

51:11.480 --> 51:12.959
Now I own a diner.

51:13.040 --> 51:15.270
Bina took over
her family's diner.

51:15.360 --> 51:17.078
And I got suckered
into managing it

51:17.160 --> 51:18.957
after we got married
just like she wanted.

51:19.040 --> 51:20.040
Like I wanted?

51:20.120 --> 51:21.348
Who else would've
wanted that?

51:21.440 --> 51:23.351
You asked my father
if you could.

51:23.440 --> 51:26.432
You renamed the family
diner after yourself.

51:26.560 --> 51:28.232
That was your idea.
What?

51:28.320 --> 51:29.355
Uh-huh.

51:30.880 --> 51:34.634
I wanted to be a high school guidance
counselor but instead I went to prison.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.517
You made the right decision.

51:36.600 --> 51:38.272
How did you steal
all that money?

51:38.920 --> 51:40.638
Right. Yeah, well, uh...

51:41.000 --> 51:43.150
Roger got me a job
in his office

51:43.240 --> 51:44.880
when he worked
for the Ford Motor Company.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.952
I'm quite good
with numbers,

51:47.080 --> 51:50.038
so I worked out a way
to steal $125,000.

51:50.920 --> 51:52.273
So I did.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.271
What did you do with it?

51:54.360 --> 51:55.360
Oh, it wasn't for myself.

51:55.440 --> 51:58.000
My friend Eric, who's an absolute
sweetheart, a lovely bloke,

51:58.080 --> 51:59.957
his wife was very sick
and needed an operation.

52:00.040 --> 52:01.951
Well,
then you saved a life.

52:02.040 --> 52:05.430
No. Because it turned out she
wasn't as sick as we thought.

52:05.520 --> 52:07.590
On account of the fact
she didn't exist.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.456
I don't think
he'd ever been married.

52:11.480 --> 52:12.480
What?

52:14.160 --> 52:15.991
He made it up
just for the money.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.416
You just called him
a sweetheart!

52:17.440 --> 52:19.829
He was a lovely bloke.
He was always nice to me.

52:21.440 --> 52:23.749
Except for when he made me
go to prison.

52:23.960 --> 52:25.871
Renzo.
Yeah, what?

52:26.720 --> 52:28.039
What's with the fur tie?

52:28.120 --> 52:29.235
Oh, thank you.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.475
It's pretty dumb.

52:32.560 --> 52:33.993
No, come on.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.036
Yeah, it is. It is.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.196
My mom believed it would

52:40.080 --> 52:44.278
ever so slightly
convey my sexual prowess.

52:46.920 --> 52:49.388
Clonk.

52:49.520 --> 52:52.990
Terrible parents were
my bread and butter.

52:53.080 --> 52:55.000
Remember that suit
I was wearing earlier?

52:55.040 --> 52:57.480
The chaplain from the halfway
house got me that from Goodwill.

52:58.720 --> 53:02.110
And then now I'm wearing
the suit of a beautiful lady.

53:02.240 --> 53:04.754
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.

53:04.840 --> 53:05.909
You wear it well.

53:06.120 --> 53:08.475
No. I look all right.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.719
Wait. Why didn't
your dad stop you?

53:11.800 --> 53:13.711
Well, this is my dad's,
actually.

53:15.760 --> 53:19.594
He's dead now, which is
why I get to wear it. So...

53:19.920 --> 53:21.148
Did he say...

53:21.600 --> 53:22.635
Yeah.

53:25.120 --> 53:27.509
Sorry for laughing
about your dead dad.

53:27.640 --> 53:30.552
Hey, no... Guys, no.
It's not all that.

53:30.640 --> 53:32.756
I barely knew the guy, so...

53:32.840 --> 53:34.432
Strangers die
all the time, right?

53:34.520 --> 53:36.636
I mean, 150 people
die every second.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.311
150 people right there.

53:39.760 --> 53:40.880
Can't get worked up over it.

53:42.120 --> 53:43.120
You know?

53:49.360 --> 53:50.360
Better?

53:51.760 --> 53:53.034
No, not really.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.798
Thank you for trying.

53:58.680 --> 54:00.477
My junior prom is tonight.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.639
But my mom said I'd

54:02.760 --> 54:06.389
probably have a better chance
here where nobody knew me, so...

54:08.000 --> 54:10.389
I would have
danced with you.

54:10.480 --> 54:13.916
Now, in high school, I certainly
would have danced with you.

54:14.400 --> 54:16.072
And if you want
to dance now,

54:16.160 --> 54:19.357
we can just turn on
the radio and just dance.

54:19.720 --> 54:21.995
I don't think so,
but thank you.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.271
You smiled

54:28.200 --> 54:29.792
You smiled

54:31.120 --> 54:34.669
And then the spell was cast

54:36.840 --> 54:40.992
Now here we are in heaven

54:42.400 --> 54:45.039
'Cause you are mine

54:46.720 --> 54:49.234
At last

54:50.200 --> 54:51.269
Fuck.

55:40.360 --> 55:42.555
Here, Ringo! Here, Ringo.

55:42.720 --> 55:45.598
Wonder how my daughter's
gonna feel not having a dad?

55:45.680 --> 55:46.749
Daughter?

55:47.760 --> 55:48.954
Yeah.

55:49.040 --> 55:52.077
I mean, I know it's too early
to know, but... I know.

55:52.720 --> 55:56.110
Well, I have a request.
Don't call her Jo.

55:56.720 --> 56:00.349
I met you today and you think I'm
gonna name my daughter after you?

56:00.480 --> 56:02.152
No, of course not.

56:02.440 --> 56:05.716
I've been a nanny to a lot
of children who've grown up

56:05.840 --> 56:07.910
and if they don't
see fit...

56:08.600 --> 56:11.717
I really just wanted
to volunteer that

56:11.800 --> 56:14.314
Jo is a good enough
name for a boy,

56:14.400 --> 56:16.960
but a terrible curse
for a girl.

56:17.920 --> 56:21.276
Now let's see,
a girl's name...

56:24.120 --> 56:28.477
The only girl's name I can
think of right now is Nikki.

56:30.120 --> 56:32.509
Well, it won't be
Nikki, so...

56:36.360 --> 56:39.033
Look, it's a wedding
I won't ruin.

56:41.360 --> 56:43.157
I should go back in.

56:44.040 --> 56:46.076
Tell Francie
about the cake.

56:46.160 --> 56:49.152
Let's sit out
for a little while.

56:49.480 --> 56:53.439
The world feels
almost perfect right now.

56:53.520 --> 56:55.238
Crap!

56:56.680 --> 56:58.079
That's cool.
I'm cool.

57:09.200 --> 57:11.919
I know why you came!

57:12.160 --> 57:14.355
You love weddings? Please.

57:14.440 --> 57:16.670
You couldn't get through
our wedding day fast enough.

57:17.280 --> 57:19.794
It's funny it took me
so long because honestly,

57:19.880 --> 57:22.000
Bina, I didn't think you had
it in you to surprise me.

57:22.040 --> 57:23.519
Okay.
Yeah.

57:23.600 --> 57:26.034
You're many things, Bina, but
surprising is not one of them.

57:26.680 --> 57:30.514
When you went to the bathroom in the
nanny's room, you used the phone.

57:30.600 --> 57:31.600
Uh-huh.

57:31.680 --> 57:33.256
I know this because
a little light came on

57:33.280 --> 57:34.998
in the bedroom
when you did that.

57:35.400 --> 57:37.550
Okay.
So, who did you call, Bina?

57:37.680 --> 57:40.592
You only know two people at this
wedding and I'm one of them.

57:40.680 --> 57:44.070
You're arranging to meet with Henry
Grotsky after the wedding's over?

57:44.160 --> 57:46.310
Hmm? Maybe back
in the ballroom

57:46.440 --> 57:48.032
after the happy couple
is gone

57:48.120 --> 57:49.599
and I'm upstairs
in the room?

57:49.680 --> 57:52.114
You're gonna sell our diner
to Henry Grotsky.

57:53.560 --> 57:56.154
You don't out-detective me,
Bina Kepp.

57:57.040 --> 57:59.031
I came to have an affair.

58:02.240 --> 58:03.389
Ha-ha.

58:05.440 --> 58:07.590
No way. I know you.

58:15.560 --> 58:17.391
Bina, an affair?

58:19.840 --> 58:20.909
Bina!

58:21.040 --> 58:23.554
Walter, would you come
with me, please?

58:23.640 --> 58:25.756
Yeah. I'm flattered.

58:34.560 --> 58:35.754
Goodbye.

58:43.120 --> 58:44.120
Goodbye.

58:55.640 --> 58:57.392
I should just let you
know that I've got

58:57.480 --> 58:59.710
a little bit of eczema
behind my knees.

58:59.800 --> 59:03.952
And, um, oh, last year
I had a cold sore,

59:04.040 --> 59:07.077
but that was because Jalapeno
was using my washcloth.

59:07.200 --> 59:08.792
And not just on his face.

59:09.040 --> 59:12.589
But, yeah, otherwise,
I'm all fine so

59:12.720 --> 59:14.950
just let me know when you want
to start the intercourse.

59:15.120 --> 59:16.473
What?
What?

59:16.640 --> 59:17.789
What?

59:18.320 --> 59:20.038
Sorry, why am I here?

59:20.360 --> 59:21.634
Not that.

59:22.040 --> 59:23.678
I'm sorry.
Okay.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.312
But no.
No?

59:26.440 --> 59:27.839
Was it talking
about Jalapeno

59:27.960 --> 59:30.110
washing his testicles
that ruined the mood?

59:30.200 --> 59:31.519
Um... Sure.

59:44.160 --> 59:45.639
How bad is it?

59:49.640 --> 59:50.789
Pot.

59:52.400 --> 59:53.992
It's medicinal, right?

59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.234
We could open our own
ladies' detective agency.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.351
Put Mr. Kepp out of business.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.474
How bad?

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.358
Oh, I'd say that

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.557
I'm due around
the same time you are.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.115
So?

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.869
What did he say?

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.376
He said that I should be
in the Woodside

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.879
ballroom serving
hors d'oeuvres

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.638
because they're
understaffed, apparently.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.468
Did you have a chance
to ask the thing

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.073
I sent you over there for?

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:00.840
Oh, yes. Yes. Denny,
who's that man there,

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.376
he said that there's
no one registered

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.038
under the name
you asked about.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.069
Huh. Did you say
the right name?

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.754
Yeah, Denny. It's on his nametag.
I saw it.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.831
Right. Not him.
Oh, Fo, yes.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.992
I said Tom Fo.
"Is there a Tom Fo here?", I said.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.957
And he said...
He said, "No."

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.550
Okay. Right.
No Fo.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.988
Yeah.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.680
Sorry.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.716
God, that's so weird.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.240
Walter?

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.838
Yes.
Where are you going?

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.416
I gotta go and help with
the hors d'oeuvres

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.112
in the Woodside ballroom.
Why?

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.514
Understaffed.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.350
So, you're not the friendliest
guy in the world.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.589
I am not.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.477
How did you manage
to seduce Bina?

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.633
Bad timing? It is bad timing,
I realize that now.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.914
If I tell you this,
will you stop walking with me?

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.038
Not sure.
It was summer camp.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.954
I was a junior counselor.
She was a senior counselor.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.873
Honestly, Renzo,
it's no big secret.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.110
Camp does most
of the seducing.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.396
Less often than you think.
Oh.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.678
Well, for me,
I was okay at dancing.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.229
Probably better than okay.
So we danced.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.796
And that's it.
That's all it takes.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.598
Find out the one thing
you're good at,

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.398
make sure the girls
know about it.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.478
Even if it's something
very private?

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.478
My understanding of women
seems poor right now.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.631
I'd say go with your gut.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.558
Ah...

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.072
Francie doesn't even
remember me, does she?

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.995
Ah, those rotten kids.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.988
What did you
ever see in that boy?

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.918
I can't even
think about it.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:01.350
What if you came here
for a different reason today?

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.516
What if you went away
with someone better?

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.034
What if I know how to find
your wedding crasher?

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.240
Go with your gut.
Go with your gut. Go with your gut.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.636
Megan-Ann, Mr. Pfaffler,

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.392
you probably
don't remember me.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.839
We're not going to
talk about it.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.478
Of course not.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.393
Let's just watch the kid
in his moment of triumph.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.318
There is something I forgot to mention
the first time I arrived here,

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.914
and that is that I
have a gigantic penis.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.314
Excuse me?
Oh, my God!

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.595
Oh...

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.874
Oh, shit.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.349
That's disgusting.
This wedding is over for you.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.056
I need you to give me
the phone number of somebody

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.936
that I can call to get you out
of here right now.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.234
Oh! Mmm-mmm.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.957
So...
Mr. Pfaffler said he's gonna call my mom.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.519
And the girl?

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.999
She started to cry.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.271
I think I didn't
describe it appealingly.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.874
We'll work on the wording
before you try again.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.915
You're coming with me.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.593
Hello, friend.
Just stay right there.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.475
Is this the guy you meant?

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.512
Nope. I'm pregnant
with his baby,

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.953
but not the guy
I'm looking for.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.115
Wow. One cigarette break and
you miss an awful lot, right?

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.039
Oh. This guy?

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.397
That guy, this guy.
Huck something.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.479
Yeah. I know who that guy is,
but his name is not Huck.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.192
No one's really named
Huck anymore.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.393
Oh, shit.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.675
Right.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.438
Okay, let's go.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.318
Come on!
Yeah.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.195
Only you
are my shining star

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.398
Don't you go away

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.876
Yeah, baby

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:22.157
Wanna be right here
where you are

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.597
Until my dying day

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.560
Yeah, baby

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.553
Nice bit of cake?

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.039
Oh, Nanny Jo,
everybody...

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.680
Sorry it's taken us
so crazy long to get here.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.160
We're so glad
you could all make it.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.191
You're the Kepps, right?
Yeah.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.197
My mom says
your fries are better

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.589
than the ones in
all of my dad's diners.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.314
Well, that's not what I thought
I'd leave with here today,

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.719
but it's something,
so thank you.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.800
Sure.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.359
We hope it all
works out for you.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.589
It'd be great if it did.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.192
Cousin Walter?
I'm glad you could come.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.032
Thank you
for inviting me.

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.633
It was simply amazing.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.269
Truly wonderful day.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.799
Oh, thank you.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.120
Ah.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.832
He's such a great guy.
Yeah.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.194
Sorry about being
so far away from you today.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.315
No.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.656
I felt like we weren't even
in the same place, you know?

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.229
No. It's the same wedding no matter
what table you're at, right?

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.355
Yeah.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.273
I'm so glad you came over because
I was just saying I'm so tired.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.920
Gonna head out.
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.592
Okay, so...

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.398
You look so beautiful.
Thank you.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.993
And congratulations
or best wishes

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.877
or whatever
you're supposed to say.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.272
And this was great.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.314
Bye, guys.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.839
Have a good night.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.189
Hey.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.953
I know I'm probably
the last person

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.678
in the world you ever
want to see again.

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.348
And I get that.
Totally understand.

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:38.237
And it will probably suck
for you to have to

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:40.356
see me again
under any circumstances

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.033
which is why
I wanted to say that

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.357
whatever happened between
us and however it ended

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.870
I think, you know,

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.198
I could be
a really good dad,

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.790
probably,
if you'll just...

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.393
If you'll let me.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:01.231
So, that's it.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.268
Goodbye.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.752
What are you doing?

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.113
I don't know
how you fixed this,

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.997
but it really
meant a lot.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:35.832
Well, it's been so
great to catch up with you all.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.279
I hope you all
got to dance

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:39.356
to your heart's
content.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.319
Do you still have
the golden bird?

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.828
Oh, Nanny Jo.

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:48.112
You don't even
remember it, do you?

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:50.112
No, of course I do.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.877
I don't know why I should
be embarrassed about this,

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.350
but I lost it almost immediately
after you gave it to me.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.749
I cried so hard
Teddy gave me his.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.313
He was always
good like that.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.674
Francie,
we should go.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.835
Okay.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.672
Thanks again for coming,
everyone.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.136
It wouldn't have been
the same without you.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.230
Please proceed to the docks

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.118
to see off
Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.155
What is it with you people?

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:21.631
Teddy Millner is the sweetest
child I've ever known.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.754
- Teddy!
- Teddy!

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.988
I don't see him.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.275
Did he get on? Teddy!

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.193
Teddy!

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.953
Teddy!

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.837
Oh, my God!

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.114
Wait!

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.753
Too late! Sorry!

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.518
I was wrong!

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:16.635
What?

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.959
It's crazy!
It is! It so is!

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.669
It's crazy!
After everything.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.509
Sweetheart,
you're embarrassing yourself!

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.239
Shut up, Nikki!

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.117
Shut up.
What?

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.193
I can't not be
in love with you.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.638
You screw up all the time.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.188
But so do I. Way worse!

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.713
Great toast, folks!
Goodnight!

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.791
The baby's a screwup!

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.872
Perfect, thank you.
The baby is a...

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.998
Wait, what baby?

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.309
It's a great screwup!
It's this perfect screwup!

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.554
What?

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.589
I don't want to be disappointed
by anybody but you!

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.151
And I don't want to
disappoint anybody but you.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.996
What are you saying?

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.439
Please.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.596
It was Tom Fo,
wasn't it?

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.799
What does it matter who?

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.916
Doesn't matter,
not at all.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.877
I just like being
a good detective.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.274
Gives me something.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.952
Well, he never showed up,

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.349
so it really
doesn't matter who.

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.159
You know what they say?
Showing up is 90% of love.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.676
Yeah, and not being an
asshole is the other 10%.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.400
He didn't show up. I did.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.072
No, you didn't.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.918
Neither did I.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:47.838
And the people we were
supposed to become together,

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.157
they never showed up.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.438
Was there ever a time you
would have done that for me?

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.717
Just, like, shout out
across a lake at me,

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.393
in front of a bunch
of strangers,

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.675
about how you
really felt about me?

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.157
We shout at each other in front
of strangers all the time.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.397
I'll take that as a no.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.432
Would you do that for me?

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.188
Well, the you then
or you now?

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.039
I'm the same.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.388
No, I'm the same.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.794
No, not really.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.633
The Bina I married
would never cheat on me.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.913
Well, the Jerry
I married...

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.035
What?

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.709
What?

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.316
The Jerry
you married what?

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.718
How am I different?

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.278
Because I'm not.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.590
So stop saying I am.
It's not fair.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.189
The Jerry I married
loved me.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.194
Yeah, that's what
I thought. Okay.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.399
We're ridiculous.

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.559
We're ridiculous?

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.236
Yeah, everyone
is ridiculous, Jerry!

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.834
Okay? You deal with it
'cause you have to!

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.388
Do you?
Yeah, you do! That's life!

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.994
You're ridiculous
and a mess!

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.439
And you still hope that
you'll find someone

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.069
who'll think that you're
okay enough to be loved.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.799
Is that what life is?
Yeah, it is.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.710
And it's really weird that
you don't know that by now!

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.272
Where are we?

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.349
Guys?

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.753
Where did they go?

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.155
That's the wrong way.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:36.598
Well, I don't know
which way we're going.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.750
Wasn't there a shortcut here?
We missed it.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.238
I showed up.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.270
Oh, I heard
what you said

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.555
to the dumb girl
at table seven.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.028
Well, I didn't
word it right.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.269
No, you're okay.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.313
Congratulations.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.269
Uh...

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.193
Hey, I got these.
Room 430.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.360
Maybe in a couple of years.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:20.393
Wait, really?

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.480
Okay, it's booked.
A few years from now.

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.357
Room 430. I'll be there!

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.389
I'll see you
in a couple of years!

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.113
Yes!

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.589
Hey.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.478
Is there anything left?

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.394
Not unless you count the lingering
melancholy that once was joy.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.672
She means cake.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.751
Oh. Then, yeah.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.509
Thank you.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.919
Mmm.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.953
Oh!

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.318
Is it good?

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.799
Yeah, really good.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.634
Oh, shit.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.110
What did you say?
Oh, my Lord!

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.315
Holy shit!

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.914
What did you say
back there? It was...

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.349
What did you do?

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.158
It was hard to hear,

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.549
you know, with, like,
the wind and Nikki

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.631
in my ear,
and then,

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.553
when I got on the railing,
everybody started shouting.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.200
And then underwater,
you can't,

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.436
like, hear anything
underwater.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.073
But it sounded like,

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.469
you know,

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.312
you were getting
to something good.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:51.949
Um...

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.712
Uh... It was like

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.076
about how,
if you're, shit,

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.596
ready to be, like, the person
who always forgives me,

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.989
then I want to be the person
who always forgives you.

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.560
I don't know,
it was better than that.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.039
That's really good.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.360
Can we do that?

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.357
Let's do that.
Okay.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.508
Moving forward
using all my breath

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:51.436
Making love to you
was never second best

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:57.151
I saw the world thrashing
all around your face

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:03.993
Never really knowing
it was always mesh and lace

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:08.549
I'll stop the world
and melt with you

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:13.150
You've seen the difference

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.869
And it's getting better
all the time

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.157
There's nothing
you and I won't do

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.829
I'll stop the world
and melt with you

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:33.872
Dream of better lives
The kind which never hate

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.518
You should see

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:39.792
Dropped in a state
of imaginary grace

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.518
You should know better

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:45.798
I made a pilgrimage
to save this human's race

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.757
You should see

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.155
Goodnight, Mom.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.759
Goodnight, Teddy.

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.759
Bye, Carol.

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.951
Thought you
didn't have family.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.479
The evidence is mounting up
against you, Walter.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:40.038
Renzo,
your study buddy is here!

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.312
Hey. Here's your mail.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.516
Thanks.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.149
Hi.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.518
Please don't slam
the door, even for that.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.355
Ringo?

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.879
You're gonna make him fat.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.393
Oh, yeah, I am.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.959
Well, we are.

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.991
Here you go, Ringo.

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.750
Okay, you're sure
you didn't forget anybody?

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.976
I told you a million times,
okay? I didn't forget anybody.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.911
Sorry. Thank you.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.109
You're welcome.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.839
Okay, so this
is the last batch of...

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.999
Teddy, where's the baby?

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:19.748
Baby. Oh, man!

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.111
Come on, man.
I know, I'm sorry.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.998
It's just, you know,
if you forget the baby...

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.576
I'm not sure
I believe you when you say

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.636
you didn't forget
any of our friends.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.995
Hi!

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:34.438
Here he is.
Aw!

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.096
The world's best dad
when you don't forget

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.792
our baby
in the empty apartment.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.911
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.797
Hello, my old heart

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:34.034
Hello, my old heart

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:59.434
Hello, my old heart

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:07.760
Hello, my old heart
