12:18.036 --> 12:19.904
Francis Thorp is a rolling stone.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.491
12 jobs in 10 years.

12:21.516 --> 12:23.633
And Sunrise Healthcare
only lasted five months.

12:23.658 --> 12:25.561
- That's unusual?
- For a nurse? Yeah.

12:26.001 --> 12:27.211
For a serial killer?

12:27.245 --> 12:28.580
Sounds just about right.

12:30.554 --> 12:32.490
Well, I can see why Mary likes you.

list was built for one,

13:07.052 --> 13:08.763

13:08.788 --> 13:11.057
Huh? We could travel.

13:12.193 --> 13:14.862

lovely this time of year.

- Oh, my God.

13:20.244 --> 13:22.846
No. No crowds. No beaches.

proper English tea party.

No, I don't. Alice is a survivor.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.253
Do you know why people love that book?

14:06.278 --> 14:08.879
It's because Alice
doesn't let fear stop her.

14:08.913 --> 14:10.009
She deals.

14:11.978 --> 14:15.048
- I'm still nervous.
- Try this.

14:16.363 --> 14:18.198

it more than I do anyways.

As I said on the phone,

15:29.665 --> 15:31.319
I'm here on behalf of Eden General.

15:31.571 --> 15:32.798
I'm not sure if you're aware,

15:32.823 --> 15:34.880
but they're opening a new
palliative care centre.

first I'm hearing of it.

15:42.623 --> 15:44.241

15:44.599 --> 15:46.481

that used to work here,

by the name of Francis
Thorp, as a nurse.

15:50.146 --> 15:53.072
- Francis Thorp?
- Yeah. She's in her 50s,

was here for about 5 months.

Yes, that's right. Yeah,
she wasn't here very long.

Hmm. Do you mind
telling me why she left?

16:01.480 --> 16:03.146
It's funny, I can't really remember.

16:03.806 --> 16:05.562
I think it just wasn't a fit.

16:05.597 --> 16:08.024
Oh, that is funny. I mean,
considering you're...

16:08.282 --> 16:10.704

16:10.829 --> 16:13.145
It would be great if I could
see a copy of her file.

are confidential, and

Well, I guess I'll just have to
put in an official request, then.

Problem is, once I do that, then
it's completely out of my hands.

You know, any red flags, they
go straight to the investigators.

16:33.506 --> 16:34.842

hire this woman or not.

Francis around the property.

of it killed my mother.
