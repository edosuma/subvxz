00:13.541 --> 00:19.125


00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.041 --> 01:00.416


01:11.708 --> 01:14.625
Prepare to have your face rearranged, pal.

01:15.208 --> 01:17.625
You're messing with the wrong mug, buddy.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.333
Three…

01:20.333 --> 01:21.166
Two…

01:22.166 --> 01:23.333
One, go!

01:27.083 --> 01:29.291
Take this! And that! And some more…

01:33.916 --> 01:37.041
Take that! Take that! Take that!

01:38.500 --> 01:39.333
Uh-oh.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.250
What was that?

01:42.791 --> 01:43.916
Ooh!

01:44.000 --> 01:44.833
What is it?

01:47.416 --> 01:48.416
Uh…

01:48.500 --> 01:52.125
Nothing, at all. Nothing. Why? What? Why?

01:53.208 --> 01:54.916
Oh, it's something.

01:57.125 --> 01:57.958
Hmm…

01:59.875 --> 02:01.250
-Hmm…

02:04.041 --> 02:06.250


02:15.500 --> 02:16.666
Can you feel this?

02:22.083 --> 02:23.166
Hey! Give me that!

02:27.416 --> 02:30.000
Buddy, relax. We'll handle it.

02:31.666 --> 02:35.416
I mean, take care of it.
Easy as pie.

02:35.916 --> 02:36.750
See?

02:44.041 --> 02:45.708
Boy, that never gets easier.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.166
Don't worry just yet.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.416
How do I look?

02:52.500 --> 02:53.833
Good as new.

02:56.916 --> 02:58.875
Hmm… Oh!

03:02.708 --> 03:04.333


03:07.833 --> 03:09.500
And voilà!

03:10.000 --> 03:10.958
Thanks, Cuphead.

03:15.541 --> 03:16.958


03:17.583 --> 03:20.916
-

03:25.208 --> 03:26.958
-Hmph!

03:28.916 --> 03:33.125
If only there were some substance
that could stick one item to another

03:33.208 --> 03:34.958
that didn't attract bears.

03:35.041 --> 03:35.875
Hmm…

03:42.000 --> 03:45.833
Hold on there, Mugsy.
This ain't over till we say it's over.

03:46.666 --> 03:47.708
It's over.

03:47.791 --> 03:48.625
Aw!

03:48.708 --> 03:51.125
You're getting worked up over nothing.

03:52.166 --> 03:55.666
Oh, really? Why don't we snap off
<i>your</i> handle too then?

03:56.250 --> 03:57.333
No!

03:57.416 --> 03:59.000
I mean, no?

04:01.208 --> 04:05.833
What if it never sticks back on?
A mug without a handle is just a bowl!

04:05.916 --> 04:09.416
I'm a mug! I'm Mugman! Not Bowlboy!

04:10.166 --> 04:12.541
I don't wanna be Bowlboy!

04:13.125 --> 04:15.708
I never shoulda let you talk me into this!

04:15.791 --> 04:19.541
What?! You were the one begging
for a blindfolded pillow fight.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.375
This is hardly the time to point fingers!

04:22.458 --> 04:24.125
Well, don't get mad at me!

04:24.208 --> 04:25.875
Well, don't get mad at <i>me</i>!

04:25.958 --> 04:29.333
I'm the one racking my brain
trying to remember what glue is!

04:30.333 --> 04:31.666
Hey! That's right!

04:31.750 --> 04:33.875
Glue is glue!

04:33.958 --> 04:35.208
Here we go.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.583
Oh, boy.

04:40.791 --> 04:42.958
I'm never gonna fix my handle.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.041
Maybe I am Bowlboy.

04:45.125 --> 04:49.291
Aw, this ain't nothing. We can just get
some new glue from Porkrind's.

04:49.375 --> 04:51.833
But I can't go out looking like this.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.416
No one's even gonna notice.

05:04.583 --> 05:09.083
Mugs, I get that you don't wanna be seen,
but why do I gotta do stuff?

05:09.708 --> 05:12.250
Pipe down and scatter those flower petals.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.291
Aww!

05:25.833 --> 05:27.791
Broken handle!

05:27.875 --> 05:29.041
It's hideous!

05:34.250 --> 05:36.750
Well, I think he looks swell!

05:37.375 --> 05:39.791
Nobody asked you, Bowlboy!

05:42.875 --> 05:44.916
Gee, what's eatin' him?

05:45.500 --> 05:48.083
<i>It's Frenchy's Dream</i>
<i>and Granny's Whiskers!</i>

05:48.166 --> 05:49.541
<i>It's Frenchy's Dream!</i>

05:49.625 --> 05:52.750
<i>It's Granny's Whiskers!</i>
<i>It's Frenchy's Dream-- Oh, no!</i>

05:52.833 --> 05:55.500
<i>Granny's Whiskers wins by a hair!</i>

05:55.583 --> 05:58.125
-Granny's Whiskers…

05:58.208 --> 05:59.041
Knock-knock!

05:59.125 --> 06:01.458
Porkrind! We've got a problem!

06:02.583 --> 06:03.833
Do you now?

06:03.916 --> 06:07.083
-We need a tube of glue bad.
-Real bad.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.500
Gonna be real expensive then.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.791
We'll pay anything, Porkrind!

06:12.500 --> 06:15.916
Well, la-di-da.
Somebody knows the magic words.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.666
So, what are we gluing?

06:22.041 --> 06:25.791
Of course! He's disgusted
by my disembodied handle.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.875
Nah. I don't care
about you or your handle.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.875
I just ate a rank fish sandwich.

06:36.208 --> 06:37.333
Urgh!

06:37.416 --> 06:40.541
Yep. Anyway, I'll sell you the glue.
Be back in a jiff.

06:40.625 --> 06:45.291
You see, Mugman? Nothing to worry about.
That handle will be back on in no time.

06:46.208 --> 06:49.208
That is, if you even want it back.

06:49.291 --> 06:52.166
Maybe it's time for a little change.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.083
Change?

06:53.166 --> 06:56.125
Think about it!
You could have any handle you want.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.666
How about this one?

07:01.458 --> 07:02.708
Nah. Too fancy.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.166
Too industrial.

07:05.166 --> 07:06.458
Uh, too "shticky."

07:06.541 --> 07:07.583
-No.

07:07.666 --> 07:08.916
No. No.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.500
Nah. Nope.

07:10.583 --> 07:11.416
Hmm…

07:12.750 --> 07:14.958
Nah. Nope. No. No.

07:15.041 --> 07:16.041
No!

07:16.708 --> 07:17.583
Maybe.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.041
No.

07:20.291 --> 07:23.125
Listen, I don't want
any of these other handles.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.916
I just wanna be me again.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Ah, yes.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.750
The old classic.
We'll stick with the original.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.416
-Right!
-Wrong.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.750
I'm outta glue.
I get the next shipment in three months.

07:33.833 --> 07:35.166
<i>…we have Squid Inks…</i>

07:35.250 --> 07:37.416
Three months?!

07:40.541 --> 07:42.875


07:46.791 --> 07:49.958
Aw, come on, Mugsy.
Three months will go by like that.

07:50.041 --> 07:53.541
You can still go outside.
People just need to get used to it.

07:53.625 --> 07:54.625
Really?

07:56.375 --> 07:59.291
Sorry. I'm still getting used to it.

08:01.458 --> 08:03.125
Uh, Mugman?

08:03.208 --> 08:05.458
Oh, there you are, boy.

08:05.541 --> 08:07.666
Excuse us for a moment, Cuphead.

08:07.750 --> 08:10.208
Of course. I'll leave you two alone.

08:12.875 --> 08:17.833
Mugman, I'm sorry I screamed in horror
at the mere sight of you,

08:17.916 --> 08:20.791
but it just took me by surprise.

08:21.500 --> 08:26.125
Oh, but gosh,
you boys are just growing up so fast.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.875
Your bodies are going through changes.

08:29.916 --> 08:32.125
I should've known.

08:32.208 --> 08:34.916
It's about time
your baby handles fell off.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.250
Baby handle?

08:37.333 --> 08:38.750
Baby handle?!

08:38.833 --> 08:41.916
Why, yes. Your baby handles.

08:42.916 --> 08:46.666
I still remember the day
I lost my baby handle.

08:46.750 --> 08:50.000
Back when I was but a wee little kettle.

08:52.833 --> 08:56.458
<i>I was in the middle</i>
<i>of brushing my tiny little toothie,</i>

08:56.541 --> 08:59.666
<i>when to my surprise, it happened.</i>

09:00.583 --> 09:04.375
<i>Darn it, if my baby handle</i>
<i>didn't just pop right off!</i>

09:04.458 --> 09:09.166
<i>Like all good boys, I knew</i>
<i>that when your baby handle falls off,</i>

09:09.250 --> 09:13.500
<i>why, that means you're getting a visit</i>
<i>from the Handle Fairy!</i>

09:14.333 --> 09:19.250
<i>So, I put my baby handle</i>
<i>under my pillow and waited.</i>

09:33.791 --> 09:38.916
<i>In the morning, I ran over</i>
<i>to my bedroom mirror, and there it was.</i>

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
<i>My shiny, new</i>…

09:41.083 --> 09:42.583
<i>man handle.</i>

09:46.791 --> 09:47.958
Ah, youth.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.166
Woohoo!

09:49.875 --> 09:54.041
Boy! Hear that, Cuphead?
I'm getting a man handle!

09:54.125 --> 09:54.958
Hey!

09:55.041 --> 09:56.250
I want a man handle!

09:58.875 --> 10:02.208
Well, I guess
that saves the Handle Fairy a trip.

10:13.833 --> 10:16.458
Elder Kettle! Elder Kettle!

10:17.333 --> 10:18.333
Oh, uh…

10:18.416 --> 10:19.875
The Handle Fairy came!

10:19.958 --> 10:23.333
Get a load of these man handles!

10:23.416 --> 10:25.541
Oh! Looks like he--

10:25.625 --> 10:30.208
Uh, I mean,
<i>she </i>did a great job.

10:30.291 --> 10:31.875
To our man handles!

10:32.916 --> 10:33.875
Cheers!
