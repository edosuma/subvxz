00:36.411 --> 00:39.204
Yeah,
it's expensive, but it's sweet.

00:39.289 --> 00:43.375
Yeah. Are you familiar with
Gibson humbucking pickups at all, or...

00:43.460 --> 00:48.047
No, I'm sorry. I actually don't play.
It's for my dad for his 50th birthday.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.548
That's... That's really sweet.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.508
Yeah, my sisters
and I are all chipping in, so...

00:51.593 --> 00:55.596
Your dad will love these humbuckings.
I mean, they really kick ass.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.097
Excuse me,
I just have a quick question about...

00:57.182 --> 00:59.850
So, what kind of music
does your dad play?

01:02.145 --> 01:04.980
I guess it's kind ofjazz-ish, maybe?

01:05.355 --> 01:08.400
This is an excellent jazz guitar.
Pat Metheny plays one of these.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.486
- Probably the best one.
- Yeah.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.613
Is your dad into Metheny at all?

01:12.697 --> 01:16.116
Oh, I'm sorry.
I actually have no idea who that is.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.536
Pat Metheny is probably
the best fusion player of our times.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.747
He's like the Jake E. Lee
of fusion guitar players.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.249
- Yeah, are you into fusion?
- Yeah.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.043
I don't really know what that is, either.

01:26.127 --> 01:30.005
It's just... I was asking because I...
I play fusion guitar. Just curious.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.423
Yeah, I play fusion, too, actually.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.591
I teach kids.
I work with kids.

01:32.675 --> 01:33.884
- Really?
- Yeah, I work with a lot of kids.

01:33.968 --> 01:34.927
One quick...

01:35.011 --> 01:36.261
You should come
check our band out.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.847
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Okay. Sure. That's awesome.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.099
Yeah. So what do you think?

01:40.183 --> 01:43.102
Well, do you guys maybe have it
in other colors?

01:43.186 --> 01:45.229
Color? You mean finishes.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.272
Meant finishes.
- Yeah, sorry.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.191
We have a sunburst. It's beautiful.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.276
Yeah, I just stocked one of those
in the back. I can go grab it.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.444
- No, I can pick it up.
- You want to see it?

01:52.529 --> 01:54.071
- No, I'll get it. It comes with a case.
- I'll get it.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.949
- I'm going to get the case.
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.283
I'm gonna get...
I'm gonna grab the case.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.660
Awesome.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.919
Well, I said, friend

02:10.505 --> 02:13.465
Don't take her, she's all I've got

02:15.218 --> 02:19.721
Please don't take her love
away from me

02:20.723 --> 02:23.600
I'm beggin' you, friend

02:24.227 --> 02:26.979
Don't take her, she's all I've got

02:27.063 --> 02:29.064
Oh, shit!

02:29.440 --> 02:34.111
She's everything in life I'll ever need

02:35.071 --> 02:37.197
She is life

02:39.075 --> 02:41.660
When I want to live

02:42.829 --> 02:48.458
She's everything to me in life
that life can give

02:49.002 --> 02:50.669
She's my water

02:50.753 --> 02:52.921
That's not really my thing.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.007
When I need a drink

02:56.342 --> 02:59.219
She's the first thought in my mind

02:59.304 --> 03:01.013
- Hey, Step.
- Hi there, Joel.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.931
- Mary.
- Hello, Joel.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.766
Let me tell you now, friend

03:06.060 --> 03:08.854
Don't take her, she's all I've got

03:10.773 --> 03:15.152
Please don't take her love
away from me

03:16.321 --> 03:18.739
I'm beggin' you, friend

03:19.908 --> 03:22.784
Don't take her, she's all I've got

03:24.579 --> 03:29.917
She's everything in life
I'm ever gonna need

03:30.793 --> 03:33.253
She's my fingers

03:34.631 --> 03:37.424
When I want to feel

03:38.259 --> 03:44.056
She's the only thing in life to me
that's really real

03:44.390 --> 03:46.934
Let me tell you now, friend

03:47.810 --> 03:50.812
Don't take her, she's all I've got

03:52.523 --> 03:56.902
Please don't take her love
away from me

03:58.029 --> 04:00.656
I'm beggin' you, friend

04:01.157 --> 04:02.449
You know, I don't know what to...

04:02.533 --> 04:05.202
- They come in and...
- That's right. They're doing...

04:06.162 --> 04:11.750
She's everything in life
I'm ever gonna need

04:15.797 --> 04:17.005
You should come by tonight.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.298
It's half-price well drinks
while the game's going.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.218
Well, you always
give me free drinks, though.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.345
I know. You should come by.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.139
Might as well. There's no action going
on at my house, that's for sure.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.183
Why not? Is your wife out of town?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.978
No, I just haven't been laid
in about a month.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.484
Hey, did you get this job
through Job 1?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.320
Me, too.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.155
I started right there
on the assembly line,

04:42.240 --> 04:43.782
just like you.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.244
Only I did better. Forty crates a day.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.207
That's right, vato.
I'm the best sorter in here.

04:53.501 --> 04:57.462
Yep. Probably gonna make me
floor manager at the end of this year.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.256
- That's why they made me full-time.
- You see that?

04:59.340 --> 05:01.508
That new guy? He's holding us up.

05:01.592 --> 05:04.303
It's not my job to tell him
to hold the line, either.

05:04.387 --> 05:08.682
Hey. My band's playing on Friday.
You should check us out.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.226
It's pronounced "God's cock. "

05:12.478 --> 05:15.105
What kind of music do you listen to?
Rock?

05:16.399 --> 05:18.817
Yeah. Yeah. You'll like this.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.945
Ladies are free,
so bring some chicks, okay?

05:24.115 --> 05:25.907
Typical, typical.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.493
I'm just going to sit here.

05:28.578 --> 05:29.703
You're not going to shut it off?

05:29.787 --> 05:30.954
I'm not going to hold the line.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.958
If they're not going to do their jobs,
I'm not going to do mine.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.003
Well, if I don't get home
before about 8:00,

05:38.087 --> 05:39.338
she puts on the sweatpants,

05:39.422 --> 05:41.590
and once the sweatpants are on,
I get nothing.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.550
You know, it's over.

05:43.634 --> 05:44.801
Shit.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.097
Damn it!

05:51.434 --> 05:53.352
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

05:53.436 --> 05:55.395
What is he doing?
That's what I want to know.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.564
- Yeah? Why you ganging up on us?
- That is your job.

05:57.648 --> 06:00.359
We can't do our job
if they don't do their job!

06:00.443 --> 06:02.861
We're the only ones
that do our work around here!

06:06.032 --> 06:08.575
What is the problem? Let's settle down.

06:08.659 --> 06:09.826
Mary.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.374
Hector's new here, okay?

06:15.458 --> 06:18.627
It's gonna take him a couple of days,
so you've got to be patient.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.712
Step, listen. This is something
you're gonna have to deal with

06:20.797 --> 06:22.130
if you want to be floor manager,
you got that?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.423
Exactly.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.385
Great. Well, let's clean all this up, okay,
and get back to rolling.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.303
We cannot afford to fall behind today.
Let's go.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.305
Back to your station.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.392
See that? We always get the blame.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.394
Jesus, they're like a bunch of
damn children, you know?

06:35.478 --> 06:36.937
I feel like a babysitter.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.940
Sorry I missed the drama this morning.
I was showing boy genius down there

06:40.024 --> 06:42.109
how to back up a forklift.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.403
Look at him.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.197
That's his whole career, you know?
Driving that damn forklift.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.408
You'd think he'd want to learn how.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.743
Well, he does have that band
that he's involved in, as well.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.620
Yeah, right. Band.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.998
I bet you dollars to donuts
he sucks at that, too.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.585
- Then you got dinkus down there.
- Who? Mary?

07:00.670 --> 07:02.963
No, no. The other one.
What's-her-face?

07:03.172 --> 07:07.175
She asked me, or rather "aksed me,"
for more personal days.

07:07.802 --> 07:08.885
Just like that.

07:08.970 --> 07:12.431
I told her maybe if she figures out
how to fill out her timesheets correctly,

07:12.515 --> 07:15.016
I will give her more personal days.

07:15.518 --> 07:19.146
Don't worry. She will never fill out
her timesheets correctly.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.522
I better get out of here.

07:20.606 --> 07:24.651
Got to beat
that 8:00 sweatpant-deadline thing.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.957
Oh, shit. Do not notice me.

07:39.041 --> 07:42.544
Do not notice me. Just go back inside.
Go back inside.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.088
God damn it! Hey.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.641
Hey, Joel. Glad I caught you.
How have you been?

07:56.726 --> 07:58.977
I'm in such a hurry right now, Nathan.

07:59.061 --> 08:00.437
Yeah? You've been busy?

08:00.521 --> 08:01.938
Yes. Very, very, very busy.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.316
And I'm so busy right now,
I gotta go make a phone call.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.526
Gotta call the office
before they all leave for the day.

08:06.611 --> 08:10.113
Yeah. Hey, listen.
Real quick, while I've got you here,

08:10.198 --> 08:13.074
what are you guys doing
November 17th?

08:15.244 --> 08:18.079
On the 17th?

08:18.623 --> 08:21.416
On the 17th,
I think that we're out of town.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.460
Oh, yeah? Where you going?

08:25.296 --> 08:28.924
- Um...
- Wait a minute. I meant the seventh.

08:29.258 --> 08:32.344
You guys will definitely
be in town then, right?

08:32.970 --> 08:33.970
Yep.

08:34.054 --> 08:37.182
Great. Leslie and I are going
to this dinner.

08:37.265 --> 08:40.684
It's an annual thing.
We go every year with the Rotary Club.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.855
It's for charity.
It's just a whole lot of fun.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.358
And we would like to invite you
and Suzie

08:46.442 --> 08:47.859
to be our guests at our table...

08:47.944 --> 08:51.446
Nathan, I just... I don't think that that's
something that we're gonna want to do.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.697
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.324
Why not? It's a lot of fun.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.117
I don't know.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.413
Suzie doesn't like going
to those kinds of things.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.290
Why not?

09:02.375 --> 09:06.545
We wouldn't know anybody,
and she gets really uncomfortable.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.213
- Oh, it's not like that.
- Sure it is.

09:08.297 --> 09:12.717
No, she won't feel uncomfortable.
It's not formal or anything.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.679
It's just a real loose bunch.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.097
You know, I...

09:17.181 --> 09:19.808
Tell you what. Why don't we do this?

09:20.434 --> 09:21.810
I'm gonna go ahead
and buy those tickets,

09:21.894 --> 09:23.770
since they're gonna sell out fast.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.773
You talk to Suzie. See what she says.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.234
Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a call.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.945
You know how it is
when the wives start talking.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.865
- I can almost hear it...
- We're gonna talk about this later.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.909
Got to make the call.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.800
Sorry, Joel, I almost forgot.

09:53.884 --> 09:56.052
The tickets are $40 a plate.

09:56.137 --> 10:00.265
Now, I know that's a little bit steep,
but the food is fantastic.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.434
So, that's $80 total.
There's no tax or anything.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.436
Nathan, I really gotta get inside
and make this phone call.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.771
You and I are gonna talk about this
some other time, okay?

10:06.856 --> 10:09.357
You go do that. Hey, Joel?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.234
If you want us to look out
after the house

10:11.319 --> 10:13.486
while you're gone or anything,
we can do that.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.989
- I appreciate that.
- Okay. Yup.

10:16.657 --> 10:19.242
Hey, where you guys going, anyway?

10:21.704 --> 10:22.787
We're going on vacation.

10:22.872 --> 10:27.542
Gosh, I tell you, Leslie and I would love
to go on a vacation with you guys.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.756
I gotta go.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.966
All right, then.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.635
I appreciate it, Nathan.
Thank you so much.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.428
You do your thing.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.265
Joel? One more thing.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.643
Hey, Joel?

10:51.942 --> 10:53.234
- Hon.
- Hi.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.945
Man, that Nathan won't shut up.

10:56.030 --> 10:59.491
Oh, I know. What an asshole.
That wife of his is even worse.

10:59.575 --> 11:02.535
I mean, I wonder how long he would
talk if you just let him go, you know?

11:02.620 --> 11:05.872
I'm actually afraid
to go into our own front yard sometimes

11:05.956 --> 11:08.583
because I'm afraid
he's going to be milling around.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.168
Remember when we had our condo?

11:10.252 --> 11:12.671
We could just go
straight from the garage inside.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.381
No one would bother us.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.632
We could walk to 7-Eleven.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.511
We didn't have to worry
about plumbers or pool cleaners.

11:19.595 --> 11:21.554
Speaking of that,
we've got to hire a new pool cleaner.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.391
He never checks the chlorine levels.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.479
Sorry, it's just this new synthetic vanilla

11:29.563 --> 11:31.272
has a much higher triple point
than we thought,

11:31.357 --> 11:33.149
which means that
the new cookies-and-cream extract

11:33.234 --> 11:35.193
that we've been working on
could really work,

11:35.277 --> 11:39.239
and I just... I gotta get to this
before Weber Flavors beats us to it,

11:39.323 --> 11:42.701
'cause if something like this caught on,
it could be big.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.453
Could sell the company.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.333
Do you remember
that logo that you designed

11:50.418 --> 11:52.585
for the original
cookies-and-cream extract?

11:52.670 --> 11:56.005
I still have that framed in my office.
Do you remember it?

11:56.090 --> 11:59.968
Yeah. And now I design coupons.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.474
Do you want to go to the bedroom?

12:08.144 --> 12:11.104
- Oh, I'm a little tired.
- Really?

12:11.188 --> 12:14.566
Yeah, just... I don't know.
It's the middle of the week.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.735
It's not the middle of the week.
It's Monday, baby.

12:16.819 --> 12:17.819
It's Monday? Shit!

12:17.903 --> 12:20.029
- What happened?
- Dancing with the Stars.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.824
Oh? Is it on?

12:27.496 --> 12:30.039
I gotta get a house
that's got a bathroom

12:30.124 --> 12:32.625
that doesn't share a wall with the TV.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.627
Why would you do that?

12:34.712 --> 12:37.046
Because it is a little tough to jerk it

12:37.131 --> 12:39.591
with the TV blaring at you
through the wall, Dean.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.468
Well, why don't you use
one of the other two bathrooms?

12:41.552 --> 12:43.511
It'd be too suspicious.
We don't use those bathrooms.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.014
I'll just...
I'll put some insulation in or something.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.515
Insulation?

12:47.850 --> 12:51.102
You do not need
to put fiberglass in your walls

12:51.187 --> 12:53.772
because you have so much
masturbation shame.

12:53.856 --> 12:57.066
You need to take responsibility
for yourself and snap one off

12:57.151 --> 12:59.486
wherever you want to
in your own home.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.947
You own your house.
You own your own business.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.033
I mean,
you used to be a bartender here.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.451
Now look at what you have.

13:06.535 --> 13:09.037
I know, but come on. What...
What, really, do I have?

13:09.121 --> 13:10.538
Okay? It's a pain in the ass.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.749
I work all the time.
What does it get me?

13:12.833 --> 13:14.834
Nobody cares about extracts,
certainly not my wife.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.338
The stock guy with the shitty band
probably gets laid more often than I do.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.466
Yeah, but he probably lives
in a really crappy apartment.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.885
I would very gladly move
into a crappy apartment

13:23.969 --> 13:26.888
if the bathroom
wasn't right next to the TV.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.349
It belonged to my father.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.769
He passed away last month
and we have all these stupid bills,

13:32.853 --> 13:34.854
and it's just been really hard for me,
you know?

13:34.939 --> 13:37.315
He was really into fusion.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.151
You know, I'm not supposed to say this,

13:40.236 --> 13:42.946
but given the circumstances,

13:43.364 --> 13:45.657
you know, you could take this
down to the music store

13:45.741 --> 13:46.991
and get a lot better deal.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.994
No, that's okay. Really.
I just wanna get this over with.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.664
- I just want it gone.
- I understand. I understand. Here.

13:52.748 --> 13:56.709
I just... I want you to have a little extra.
Here. Come on.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.797
- No. No, no, no. I couldn't. No. No.
- No, no. Just... Just take the money.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.800
You've been through enough already.
Come on.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.010
Okay. Okay.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.846
Oh, my gosh.

14:07.930 --> 14:12.267
God bless you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.648
Hey.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.192
Are we still looking into
replacing her with a robot?

14:21.277 --> 14:23.820
Yeah, sure. But we might not have to.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.280
You're not gonna believe this,
but remember that guy,

14:25.364 --> 14:27.031
Michael J. Natherton
from General Mills,

14:27.116 --> 14:29.325
who called a while back, talking like
he might want to buy us out?

14:29.410 --> 14:31.369
Yeah. I thought you said
that he wasn't serious,

14:31.453 --> 14:32.579
he was just kicking the tires.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.123
Yeah, well, he's serious now.
He just made us an offer.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.958
- I mean, a real offer.
- Are you kidding me?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.918
It must be part of some
bigger strategic move,

14:39.003 --> 14:41.921
because this is over market value,
I think.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.890
I might be able to finally unload
all this stuff and retire, huh?

14:51.974 --> 14:53.266
I mean,
there's a lot of details to work out,

14:53.350 --> 14:56.311
but, yeah, this... This could be great.

14:56.395 --> 15:00.148
He says he'll call back next week.
What should I tell him?

15:01.817 --> 15:03.693
You tell him, "Hell, yes. "

15:03.777 --> 15:05.403
Adiós, dinkus.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.073
You see that?

15:09.158 --> 15:11.409
I already warned him.
This is the last time.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.620
I'm just gonna sit here.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.797
Oh, no. What now?

16:10.052 --> 16:13.888
I knew it. That's what happens
when you don't pay attention.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.731
Yeah, all right.
Just call me if you hear anything else.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.485
He definitely lost one of them,
and they think

16:27.569 --> 16:29.821
that they can reattach the other one,
but they're not sure.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.031
Wow. That's hardcore.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.658
I have no idea how this happened.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.827
We've got such a good safety record,

16:35.911 --> 16:37.996
and we comply
with all the safety codes.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.332
I think it was just some kind
of a freak accident, you know?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.126
Well, you probably have insurance
for that, right?

16:43.210 --> 16:45.670
Yeah, of course. He's probably
gonna get a huge settlement.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.505
Yeah, I would think so.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.466
I mean, it's your balls.

16:51.427 --> 16:55.388
It kind of makes you think, doesn't it,
how fragile we all are?

16:55.848 --> 16:59.183
Especially our balls.
They're just hanging there.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.144
A little sack.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.355
Any minute,
could just be cut off forever.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.150
What'd life be like,
walking around without testicles?

17:07.233 --> 17:08.526
Can you imagine that shit?

17:08.609 --> 17:11.029
Yeah, actually,
I rarely use my balls anymore at all.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.070
What about the other night?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.115
I thought you were gonna rub one out
to Dancing with the Stars.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.159
I mean that, you know,

17:16.242 --> 17:19.494
Suzie and I have sex
maybe once every three months.

17:19.579 --> 17:23.124
You know,
sexual frustration is really hard.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.917
But I may have a solution.

17:26.462 --> 17:29.130
- What?
- You need to take some Xanax.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.051
Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety?

17:33.135 --> 17:36.888
It's good for all psychological problems
in the DSM-IV.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.184
Xanax basically
just makes you feel good.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.270
That's why it works for everything.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.482
I take it for the common head cold.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.652
I think it would work great
for sexual frustration.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.821
- Want me to get you some?
- No, I don't.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.909
You know what else is good?
Codeine cough syrup.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.745
- For what?
- It's just good.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.864
What listing?

18:36.949 --> 18:40.868
Don Wilkinson or Step Wilkinson.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.496
- One moment.
- Can I have the address, please?

18:43.580 --> 18:45.331
I'm sorry.
I'm not showing anything for either.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.000
There's a D. Wilkinson,
but it's unlisted.

18:49.419 --> 18:51.045
Okay. Thank you.

18:55.843 --> 18:56.968
So, the guys at General Mills

18:57.052 --> 18:59.762
got wind of this whole
testicular incident

18:59.847 --> 19:01.597
and they're worried.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.975
If Step decides to sue us
beyond the insurance settlement,

19:04.059 --> 19:06.561
that could be a serious liability.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.312
How is Step doing, anyway?

19:08.397 --> 19:11.149
Better.
I guess he might be going home today.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.233
Oh, good.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.651
Anyway, I guess
we don't have to worry about it.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.987
He says he's not going to sue us.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.947
Says he
wouldn't want something for nothing,

19:18.031 --> 19:20.491
you know, and what's right is right.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.743
He's being pretty mellow about this.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.078
Yeah.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.582
I think when you lose your balls,
it kind of mellows you out.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.003
Oh, by the way,
guess who asked for a raise today?

19:32.087 --> 19:34.589
- Who?
- Dinkus. Can you believe that?

19:34.673 --> 19:36.507
Brian, you know,
you call everyone here dinkus.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.426
I don't know who you're talking about.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.595
You know, forklift dinkus.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.015
I thought you call him "boy genius. "

19:44.099 --> 19:46.934
Oh, right. Yeah.
Well, boy genius asked for a raise.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.352
I said, "Are you kidding me?

19:48.437 --> 19:49.854
"You almost got somebody
killed last week. "

19:49.938 --> 19:52.315
And then he tried to blame it
on dinkus over there.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.525
You know, you really ought to learn
the employees' names.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.235
Yeah, I was thinking about that,
but then I figured,

19:56.320 --> 19:58.863
hey, if this deal goes through
next week, I won't have to.

19:58.947 --> 20:03.534
It's not like I'm gonna be inviting dinkus
and boy genius over for dinner.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.038
Oh, Joel, let me introduce you
to the new temps here.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.457
One of them wanted to meet you.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.460
Joel, this is Cindy.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.546
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.299
Oh, my God.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.134
And...

20:22.304 --> 20:23.721
I'm sorry. I forgot your name.

20:23.805 --> 20:24.931
- Victor.
- Victor! Right.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.183
Hi. Joel. Welcome.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.977
Okay.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.532
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:44.284 --> 20:50.414
Look, I'm so sorry, but are you really
the owner of this entire place?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.375
Yeah.

20:52.459 --> 20:55.503
I mean, like, you...
You started it and everything?

20:55.587 --> 20:58.172
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.342
Oh, my God. How?

21:03.178 --> 21:06.889
Just... You really wanna hear this?
A lot of people think it's boring.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.725
No, no. I... Really, I do. I wanna know.

21:09.810 --> 21:13.104
I mean, did you, like,
invent extract or something?

21:15.190 --> 21:16.440
- Kind of.
- Really?

21:16.525 --> 21:18.609
Well, my mother used to...

21:18.694 --> 21:21.737
My mother used to make
these root-beer cookies,

21:21.822 --> 21:24.240
and I always noticed
that the cookie dough

21:24.324 --> 21:25.950
tasted better
than the cookies themselves,

21:26.034 --> 21:27.201
and I thought, "Why is that?"

21:27.286 --> 21:28.995
And it turns out that a lot of the flavor

21:29.079 --> 21:31.664
in the root-beer extract evaporates
when you cook it,

21:31.748 --> 21:35.084
and so when I was in graduate school,
in chemistry,

21:35.168 --> 21:38.004
I figured out a way
to use this synthetic derivative

21:38.088 --> 21:40.965
of the wintergreen component,
and it just...

21:41.049 --> 21:45.553
It doesn't evaporate as easily.
And from that, you know...

21:48.473 --> 21:52.643
I mean, you... You figured
all of that out, like, with your brain!

21:52.728 --> 21:55.563
- Yeah.
- Oh, you must be really rich.

21:56.023 --> 21:59.317
I've got a 7 Series BMW
and some pretty nice clothes.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.402
You know so many people.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.655
- I...
- Oh, my God. You are really popular.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.535
What?

22:09.619 --> 22:13.122
It's just really cute
how your sixes look like eights.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.624
Or is it more like your eights
look like sixes?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.084
Which one is it?

22:17.169 --> 22:18.669
Hey, dude.
You wanna hit some golf balls, man?

22:18.754 --> 22:20.880
Hey, Dean. Cindy, here.

22:20.964 --> 22:22.423
Oh, damn.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.634
Goodness. Hi. Dean.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.054
Entrepreneur, spiritualist, healer.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.180
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.973
Nice to meet you.
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.350
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Welcome aboard.

22:32.434 --> 22:35.144
We're gonna play some golf,
but maybe we could all just hang out?

22:35.228 --> 22:36.896
- Dean?
- Dude.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.523
Does she work here?

22:39.608 --> 22:40.858
Yeah, she's a temp.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.819
- She's a tramp?
- Temp!

22:43.904 --> 22:47.323
And please don't stare at her.
Get away from the window.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.284
I like it, Joel. I like your style.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.079
Well, I didn't hire her.
She came over through Job 1.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.997
They just sent her over
like everyone else.

22:55.082 --> 22:59.710
Job 1, huh?
I got to give those guys a call, man.

23:00.921 --> 23:04.882
I have never seen a woman
anywhere near that hot working here.

23:04.966 --> 23:09.053
Makes sense, though, huh?
I mean, hot girls need jobs, too, right?

23:09.805 --> 23:11.389
Do they really?

23:11.932 --> 23:16.060
I mean, most of your temps
look like winos, man, and they're guys.

23:16.144 --> 23:19.063
- You wanna hear something weird, too?
- Yeah.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.565
I think that she was flirting with me.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.067
Really?

23:23.151 --> 23:25.403
- Could be wrong.
- No, I'm sure, man.

23:25.487 --> 23:28.239
Dude, you could probably have any girl
out there, that's walking around,

23:28.323 --> 23:30.574
anyone that you see right now
with the hairnet on, man,

23:30.659 --> 23:31.659
you could probably nail.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.078
- I don't know about that.
- I'm telling you, man,

23:34.162 --> 23:35.496
you're the king of this whole domain.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.456
This is your place.
You're the ruler here.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.542
You're the king of the...

23:39.626 --> 23:40.876
What is this shit
you're making out here?

23:40.961 --> 23:43.087
It's extract,
and it's spray-dried flavoring, and...

23:43.171 --> 23:45.214
You're the extract king, man.

23:45.298 --> 23:47.550
And these females out here sense that,

23:47.634 --> 23:49.677
and you can have them if you want that,
you know?

23:49.761 --> 23:53.347
I personally wouldn't, because
they're not sexually attractive to me,

23:53.432 --> 23:56.308
but, you know, that girl right there,

23:56.893 --> 23:59.186
- good for you, Joel.
Somebody stole my purse!

23:59.271 --> 24:00.604
What the shit?

24:00.689 --> 24:05.734
My purse is stolen! It's gone! He did it!
He stole my purse! You!

24:05.819 --> 24:07.611
You stole my purse! He did it!

24:07.696 --> 24:09.280
- He did it! He stole my purse!
- Hey, wait, wait!

24:09.364 --> 24:10.364
- I told you about him!
- Calm down!

24:10.449 --> 24:11.449
Calm down one minute, will you?

24:11.533 --> 24:13.742
I'm not gonna calm down!
I'm gonna call the cops!

24:13.827 --> 24:17.288
Will you please time out?
I speak the language, okay? Hector.

24:23.211 --> 24:25.379
- You know, purse-o?
- Purse! That's right!

24:25.464 --> 24:26.630
You stole my purse
and took my money!

24:26.715 --> 24:28.507
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute, okay?
- He stole my purse.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.135
Give me a break, please?
How do you know it's stolen?

24:31.219 --> 24:33.596
I know it's stolen because it's gone,
that's how!

24:33.680 --> 24:34.638
What does it look like?

24:34.723 --> 24:37.141
It's a white leather
multi-colored patchwork purse

24:37.225 --> 24:40.352
with a turquoise lining
and a cute little teddy bear in a tutu!

24:58.455 --> 25:01.332
You didn't have to love me
like you did

25:01.416 --> 25:03.876
But you did, but you did

25:04.503 --> 25:06.754
And I thank you

25:07.172 --> 25:10.049
You didn't have to love me like you did

25:10.133 --> 25:12.426
But you did, but you did

25:13.261 --> 25:15.429
And I thank you

25:16.181 --> 25:19.767
But you took your love to someone else

25:20.268 --> 25:24.146
I wouldn't know what it meant
to be loved to death

25:24.940 --> 25:28.776
You made me feel like I've never felt

25:29.319 --> 25:33.239
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

25:33.365 --> 25:36.367
You didn't have to hold it, but you did

25:36.451 --> 25:38.869
But you did, but you did

25:39.371 --> 25:41.330
And I thank you

25:51.299 --> 25:54.385
You can go ahead of me
if that's all you got.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.720
- Really?
- Yeah, sure.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.305
Are you sure?

25:59.099 --> 26:02.059
That's really, really sweet of you.
Thank you.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.728
I can't believe
I'm buying Reynold's Extract.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.815
I mean, I work at the factory, you know?

26:07.899 --> 26:10.025
Really? I work there, too.

26:10.652 --> 26:11.735
Are you serious?

26:11.820 --> 26:15.281
Yeah, I sure do.
Well, I used to, but... Yeah.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.491
Well, I just started working there.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.452
Yeah, I'm the fastest sorter there.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.831
- Really?
- Yeah. Forty crates a day.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.750
They were gonna make me
floor manager.

26:26.835 --> 26:27.960
Well, I'm Cindy.

26:46.187 --> 26:49.607
We don't do it anymore, you know?
It's... We just... I don't know what to do.

26:49.691 --> 26:53.277
We're turning into one of those
brother-sister couples.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.362
You do kind of look alike.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.114
- No, we don't.
- Okay.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.824
And to make things worse,

26:58.908 --> 27:02.953
Dean, I cannot get
that Cindy girl out of my mind.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.540
And how often am I going
to meet a girl that pretty

27:06.625 --> 27:09.627
and that into food flavoring? It's just...

27:09.711 --> 27:11.295
You know she practically
asked me out?

27:11.379 --> 27:13.297
She gave me her phone number
and everything.

27:13.381 --> 27:16.050
Asked me if I was going to that party
where Rory's band is playing.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.301
- Can you believe that?
- Really?

27:17.385 --> 27:19.219
- Yeah.
- What are you going to do?

27:19.304 --> 27:20.304
What do you mean,
what am I gonna do?

27:20.388 --> 27:21.972
I'm gonna do nothing.
I can't cheat on Suzie.

27:22.057 --> 27:25.142
I just got to power through it
until I'm too old to get it up, you know?

27:25.226 --> 27:26.393
Then I'll be all right.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.312
What if Suzie cheated on you?

27:28.396 --> 27:30.731
Right. Come on.

27:30.815 --> 27:34.026
Listen, man. I like Suzie.
You know what I'm saying?

27:34.110 --> 27:35.653
And I got nothing against her,

27:35.737 --> 27:39.406
but what if she's feeling
the same way you were? Right?

27:39.574 --> 27:42.785
What if she cheated on you?
Would that bother you?

27:44.913 --> 27:48.749
I don't... No, I guess...
No, I guess it wouldn't, at this point.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.542
I guess that's a little weird, isn't it?

27:50.627 --> 27:53.754
Yeah, a bit, but, you know,
do you think she would do it?

27:53.838 --> 27:55.339
- What? Cheat on me? No.
- You sure?

27:55.423 --> 27:57.925
Well, I don't know, actually.
Hang on. She might.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.260
Suzie might.
She could be tempted, I suppose.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.596
If some really studly guy hit on her...

28:02.681 --> 28:07.142
So, you're saying
that she would cheat on you

28:07.227 --> 28:08.852
if she were placed in temptation's way,

28:08.937 --> 28:11.730
and yet you're in temptation's way
and you're not cheating on her?

28:11.815 --> 28:13.565
- That's right.
- Okay, bro.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.025
Here's what you need to do.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.986
- I don't want drugs, Dean.
- There are ways,

28:18.738 --> 28:22.324
ancient ways from Aztec times

28:22.742 --> 28:27.454
of getting your wife to cheat on you,
if that is what you need.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.664
Let's hear it.

28:28.748 --> 28:31.750
You hire a gigolo

28:32.877 --> 28:35.546
to have an affair with your wife.

28:36.881 --> 28:40.134
- What?
- I'm serious, bro. I know a guy.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.052
- You know a gigolo?
- Yes, I do.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.303
How do you know a gigolo?

28:43.388 --> 28:45.180
- This guy, Brad.
- Brad the gigolo?

28:45.265 --> 28:49.017
Yes, who comes in here all the time.
He's friends of Cliff.

28:49.102 --> 28:52.104
You hire Brad.
He has an affair with Suzie.

28:52.522 --> 28:55.023
All right. Yeah. Don't you have
another customer to help or something?

28:55.108 --> 28:57.109
Dude, you just told me
that you wouldn't mind

28:57.193 --> 28:58.736
if she fooled around
with somebody else.

28:58.820 --> 28:59.862
And if she fools around
with somebody else,

28:59.946 --> 29:02.906
you have no guilty feelings
about hooking up with Cindy.

29:02.991 --> 29:08.245
All your problems are solved.
Stroke-of-genius idea on my part.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.748
Jesus Christ,
maybe I will try some of your Xanax.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.624
- Come on.
- Seriously.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.335
I think what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna sit Suzie down

29:15.420 --> 29:16.462
and I'm just gonna talk to her about it.

29:16.546 --> 29:19.131
- Bing!
- No, that was a joke.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.924
Not a joke.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.801
- Joking.
- Serious.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.972
This gonna shut you up?

29:30.143 --> 29:31.685
Tell me what this stuff does, again.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.732
Yeah, I just believe
what's right is right.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.150
That's right, Step.

29:38.234 --> 29:41.278
And what's right is
for you to send a message

29:41.362 --> 29:45.908
so that a horrible accident like this
never happens to anybody ever again.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.452
That's why I got a lawyer for you.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.871
You want to know who?

29:51.206 --> 29:54.124
- Who?
- The guy on all the bus-stop benches.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.752
Joe Adler? You got me Joe Adler?

29:56.836 --> 29:58.045
Yeah.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.881
You're so good to me, Cindy.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.305
Okay. Oh, my gosh. Step, I'm sorry.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.307
You're getting me aroused,

30:10.391 --> 30:12.059
and I'm getting you aroused,

30:12.143 --> 30:14.645
and your doctor said
that you should not get aroused

30:14.729 --> 30:16.563
till after the trial.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.816
Step, I'm so sorry.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.611
I'm sorry. I think we should go.
I'm sorry.

30:26.491 --> 30:29.660
Man. Look at all them mallards.

30:29.744 --> 30:32.579
I knew I should have brought
the Mossberg.

30:33.623 --> 30:34.957
Shit.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.793
Do you remember what color
that pill was I gave you?

30:37.877 --> 30:40.087
- What?
- Damn it.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.339
I don't think it was Xanax.

30:42.423 --> 30:45.884
Could have been Ritalin or Special K.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.763
I don't care. What?

30:49.848 --> 30:53.475
Well, Special K is a horse tranquilizer.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.019
It sometimes has weird effects
on humans.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.521
Hey, it's nothing to worry about.

30:57.605 --> 31:00.274
Probably just shouldn't drink anymore.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.317
Remember that thing
you were talking about?

31:02.402 --> 31:04.528
- About the gigolo?
- Yeah?

31:04.612 --> 31:06.655
You don't think that is wrong?

31:06.739 --> 31:08.407
You don't think that
that is morally wrong?

31:08.491 --> 31:09.950
What could be morally wrong
about that?

31:10.034 --> 31:11.618
Yeah, I don't know.

31:11.703 --> 31:15.163
Look, man.
If she doesn't wanna do anything,

31:15.248 --> 31:17.165
she doesn't have to, okay?

31:17.250 --> 31:20.544
But if she does,
then she's the one who sinned,

31:20.628 --> 31:21.920
and you're the one
who can go out there

31:22.005 --> 31:24.381
and drop the Joel-pole
in whoever the hell you want to.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.008
And that's what's morally appropriate.

31:26.092 --> 31:30.053
I cannot... I can't see anything
morally wrong with it, either,

31:30.138 --> 31:32.347
and... And he's a friend of yours, right?
What is his name?

31:32.432 --> 31:33.640
Brad. You want me
to get on the phone with him?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.058
No, no. Just hang on.

31:35.143 --> 31:37.978
It's very weird
to even talk about this, Dean.

31:38.062 --> 31:43.317
Dude, all you got to do is tell her
he's coming to be the new pool guy

31:43.401 --> 31:46.778
or whatever, and see what happens.
Seriously.

31:46.863 --> 31:50.407
If she doesn't go for it, terrific.

31:50.491 --> 31:53.702
Now you just feel better for not
fooling around in the first place.

31:53.828 --> 31:57.247
I think you're right,
and we do need a new pool cleaner.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.749
That's a sign, bro.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.835
Yeah, I just... I don't know. It's so nuts.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.213
You got to listen to the universe.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.633
Why don't you have
another drink, man?

32:07.717 --> 32:09.885
You know what?
Why don't I go call Brad?

32:09.969 --> 32:12.095
See what he has to say about this?

32:12.180 --> 32:13.722
What the hell.

32:15.725 --> 32:20.312
It seems pretty clear, right?
I mean, it's $200, right?

32:20.396 --> 32:21.980
Yeah. It's 200.

32:22.649 --> 32:25.943
Well, yeah. I mean, you know,
I'm getting my 10%.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.070
Come on, Dean. What are you?
You're a pimp now?

32:28.154 --> 32:31.198
I don't think they call it a pimp
when it's with a male prostitute, Joel.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.700
- All right.
They have another name for it.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.662
It's not a john,
but it's something like that.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.372
They call it something else.

32:38.456 --> 32:39.706
Look, I'm the one
who hooked this whole thing up.

32:39.791 --> 32:40.791
- I get it.
Okay?

32:40.875 --> 32:42.292
You have nothing to worry about
'cause it all comes out

32:42.377 --> 32:43.669
- of his money, anyway.
- All right!

32:43.753 --> 32:45.671
- Fine.
- So, it's $200.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.214
Yep. 220.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.007
- Dean!
- What?

32:49.092 --> 32:50.842
I have a question.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.386
Yep.

32:54.180 --> 32:57.140
So, are you, like,
gonna watch or something?

32:58.977 --> 33:02.479
No, no. No, no. No, I'm...
I'm not even gonna be there.

33:02.563 --> 33:05.148
I'm gonna be at work.
Don't you remember? We covered this.

33:05.233 --> 33:08.402
- Didn't we cover this?
- Look, dude, here's the story.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.362
What you're gonna do is,

33:10.446 --> 33:13.198
you're just gonna go
to Joel's house, okay,

33:13.282 --> 33:15.492
pretending to be the new pool cleaner.

33:15.576 --> 33:19.705
When you get there, you will simply
attempt to seduce Joel's wife.

33:19.789 --> 33:21.498
If she does not respond,

33:21.582 --> 33:23.667
you will simply
clean the pool and leave.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.711
That's it. It's just that simple.

33:25.795 --> 33:32.426
So you're not gonna, like,
try to touch my ass or anything?

33:36.180 --> 33:40.767
Listen. He will be at work.

33:41.644 --> 33:44.938
You will go by when he is not there,

33:45.606 --> 33:49.401
and you will pose as the pool cleaner

33:49.819 --> 33:52.070
trying to seduce the wife.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.658
I see. Yeah. I get it now.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.118
- It's so simple.
Yeah. I'm sorry. Cool.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.661
Yeah. You're not even gonna be there.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.538
No, he will not be there.

34:01.622 --> 34:04.249
He will not be at the house.
You will be at the house.

34:04.333 --> 34:06.293
The wife will be at the house. He will...

34:06.377 --> 34:08.378
Not be...
- Not be at the house.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.882
Cool. No problem.
This is gonna be great.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.842
Now, I want you to remember
that she might not go for it.

34:14.927 --> 34:17.054
So, awesome, yeah.
No, I can hardly wait.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.972
- She might not go for it.
- This is going to be awesome.

34:19.056 --> 34:22.684
Awesome. Hey, man,
if you know of anybody else

34:22.768 --> 34:27.563
who might need, you know, what I do,
like lonely housewives and shit,

34:27.648 --> 34:28.815
you think you could tell them
about me?

34:28.900 --> 34:31.234
Because I figure
if I can get enough of them,

34:31.319 --> 34:33.779
then maybe I could quit
my landscaping job.

34:33.862 --> 34:37.074
That would be awesome,
because I hate landscaping, dude,

34:37.158 --> 34:39.367
and I like getting laid a lot better.

34:39.452 --> 34:42.661
And I'm always seeing all kinds of
horny housewives out at the clubs,

34:42.746 --> 34:44.873
so, like I say,
if your wife has any housewife...

34:44.956 --> 34:48.126
Brad, you're killing me, man.
All right? Good talking to you.

34:48.210 --> 34:51.213
- All right.
- Good talking, all right, bro? Later.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.505
Oh? You know what else
I was thinking, man?

34:52.590 --> 34:55.092
- Later on, Brad. Good night, man.
All right, cool.

34:55.176 --> 34:58.595
Hey, let me give you a ride home.
You're not in any condition to drive.

34:58.679 --> 34:59.930
I know.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.642
This... Are you sure about this guy?
This...

35:04.143 --> 35:06.228
Oh, yeah, man. He's real cool.

35:06.312 --> 35:08.563
He just gets a little fired up
before each job.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.316
It's just... He doesn't seem that bright.

35:12.193 --> 35:15.737
I mean, what do you expect?
He's a whore.

35:36.509 --> 35:37.467
Hey.

35:37.552 --> 35:41.388
Wow, looks like you had
one of those nights, huh?

35:42.348 --> 35:44.015
So, where was I?

35:51.107 --> 35:52.983
Oh, shit.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.320
- Hello?
- Hey, Dean.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.656
- Joel.
- Thank God you're awake.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.159
Did that really happen last night?

36:02.243 --> 36:05.412
We go through with that?
That gigolo stuff?

36:05.705 --> 36:06.872
As far as I know.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.583
- God damn it!
- What?

36:09.917 --> 36:12.836
What was I thinking?
We got to call that off right now.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.589
Can you call that guy?
What's his name?

36:15.882 --> 36:18.633
Brad. Okay. Yeah, man. I'll call him.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.927
Yeah, tell him I'll pay him anyway.
Not to... Not to worry about it.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.429
Just tell him not to go over there.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.514
What was I thinking?

36:24.599 --> 36:27.017
All right, chill. Chill. I'll call him.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.269
Thanks for the drugs, Dean.

36:31.189 --> 36:35.650
Actually, I don't have his digits.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.986
What're you talking about?
Thought you called him last night.

36:38.070 --> 36:41.698
- Yeah, but I got his number from Cliff.
- You get it from Cliff again.

36:41.782 --> 36:45.202
Cliff doesn't have a phone right now.
I got it from him at the bar.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.953
Motherfucker!

36:49.290 --> 36:52.834
What's the boy's last name?
I'll call information.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.253
I don't remember. It's a Mexican name.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.421
Mexican?

36:56.505 --> 36:57.589
For Christ's sake, Dean,

36:57.673 --> 36:59.549
the guy's got blonde hair
and blue eyes. Come on.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.052
I thought it was strange, too,
a guy who looks like that

37:02.136 --> 37:05.138
had a Mexican last name,
but I don't judge people, you know?

37:05.223 --> 37:08.558
I mean, might not have been Mexican.
Could have been a Filipino name.

37:08.643 --> 37:12.145
I think it's Lopez or Sanchez.

37:13.481 --> 37:14.606
Or Gutiérrez.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.484
Shit. I got to get home
and head him off.

37:18.486 --> 37:19.819
- Joel, we got to talk.
- Not now, Brian.

37:19.904 --> 37:20.904
- It's kind of important.
- Not now, pal.

37:20.988 --> 37:21.947
- Not now.
- It's kind of really important.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.198
- It's about Step.
There's a Brad Chavez

37:23.282 --> 37:25.033
on Line 1 for you.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.704
- Who?
- Brad Chavez.

37:30.289 --> 37:31.748
Brad Chavez?

37:31.832 --> 37:33.333
You want me to take a message?

37:33.417 --> 37:37.295
No, no. That's the pool cleaner.
I better take that.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.298
Hello?

37:40.383 --> 37:42.259
- Hey, is this Joel?
- Yes, it is.

37:42.343 --> 37:44.469
- Hey, man. It's Brad.
- Hey. Thank God.

37:44.553 --> 37:46.012
Mission accomplished, dude.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.682
It worked. She totally went for it.

37:49.725 --> 37:53.645
You were not even supposed
to be there for another 45 minutes.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.189
Oh, really? Yeah.

37:57.191 --> 37:59.109
I totally forgot what time
you guys told me,

37:59.193 --> 38:02.654
and I was so excited about it
I just went over there.

38:06.367 --> 38:10.370
So, then, you... She actually...
You guys...

38:10.454 --> 38:12.163
Yep. It was easy.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.542
Easy? What does that mean, easy?

38:16.627 --> 38:20.130
No, I don't mean easy like
she was easy or anything like,

38:20.214 --> 38:22.424
"Your wife's a slut," or anything.

38:22.508 --> 38:25.385
I just meant it wasn't hard
to get her to...

38:26.512 --> 38:27.470
Never mind.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.432
Tell me. Tell me what happened.
I want to hear it all.

38:30.516 --> 38:32.684
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

38:33.561 --> 38:37.105
Okay. Well, she let me in,

38:37.732 --> 38:39.816
so I just went back
like I was cleaning the pool,

38:39.900 --> 38:42.527
and I don't know anything
about pool cleaning, right?

38:42.611 --> 38:45.030
So, I was totally just faking it,

38:45.448 --> 38:47.073
and she was in her bathing suit,

38:47.158 --> 38:49.743
so I struck up a conversation.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.329
This is a really nice house.

38:52.413 --> 38:53.788
Thank you.

38:54.248 --> 38:56.166
Is it your dad's house?

38:56.584 --> 38:58.335
No, it's... It's ours.

39:01.339 --> 39:05.633
You look so young
to be living in a house this nice.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.136
What?

39:08.804 --> 39:12.932
Do you have any sunscreen?
I forgot mine.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.226
Sure.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.145
And, see, I thought that was
pretty smart of me, right,

39:17.229 --> 39:18.855
to ask to borrow the sunscreen,

39:18.939 --> 39:22.442
because that way I could ask
if she wanted some

39:22.526 --> 39:24.527
and I could rub some
on her back, right?

39:24.612 --> 39:26.863
Instead of me just coming out
and asking to rub some on her back.

39:26.947 --> 39:29.491
It was pretty smooth, huh?

39:29.575 --> 39:34.079
Anyway, once I started rubbing lotion
all over her body,

39:34.163 --> 39:36.373
- the rest was pretty easy. She...
- All right! That's it!

39:36.457 --> 39:38.416
Stop it! I don't need to hear any more.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.210
Okay. Okay, dude.

39:40.294 --> 39:44.089
Well, hey, listen,
if you have anyone else that

39:44.173 --> 39:47.509
you want to referral me to

39:47.593 --> 39:50.678
or, like, if you want me to do
your wife again, I can...

39:50.763 --> 39:53.014
No! I've got to go. Goodbye.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.564
- Oh! Damn it!
- Yoo-hoo. Hey!

40:05.653 --> 40:07.654
- How's it going?
- I'm real busy, actually.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.906
Well, I'm not gonna keep you long.

40:09.990 --> 40:12.867
I went ahead
and got those tickets for that dinner

40:12.952 --> 40:15.954
we talked about going to together
on the seventh.

40:16.038 --> 40:18.665
I think I mentioned
that they were 40 apiece.

40:18.749 --> 40:22.544
Well, as it turns out,
they're a tad more this year. 55.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.504
I told you that we really
didn't want to go to that thing.

40:24.588 --> 40:25.588
Don't you remember that?

40:25.673 --> 40:28.258
I know you said something
about Suzie feeling uncomfortable,

40:28.342 --> 40:31.386
but like I say,
she won't feel uncomfortable at all.

40:31.470 --> 40:34.139
She could wear a pantsuit,
if that's the issue.

40:34.223 --> 40:37.350
- It's not formal or anything.
- No. It's not the problem, Nathan.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.603
What? Does she not like
to wear a dress ever?

40:40.688 --> 40:42.188
I gotta go.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.358
One more thing! I'm busy, too.

40:55.911 --> 41:00.165
Joel, I was thinking,
maybe we could go on vacation,

41:00.708 --> 41:02.000
just the two of us.

41:02.084 --> 41:04.377
We haven't done something like that
in a long time,

41:04.462 --> 41:07.589
and I know they have really
great deals right now in the Caribbean.

41:07.673 --> 41:09.549
I hate the Caribbean.

41:10.259 --> 41:11.634
Really? Why?

41:11.719 --> 41:13.386
'Cause it sucks.

41:15.222 --> 41:17.974
But I thought you liked
going to hot places,

41:18.058 --> 41:20.477
you know, so you can wear your shorts.

41:20.561 --> 41:23.563
I don't feel so good.
I'm gonna go to bed.

41:24.773 --> 41:26.399
Is it the food?

41:43.918 --> 41:47.003
Well, actually, I'm in, like,
five bands right now,

41:47.087 --> 41:50.340
but God's Cock is basically
the same four guys as Fight Head,

41:50.424 --> 41:53.426
but Fight Head's more of, like,
a thrash skate-punk-type thing,

41:53.511 --> 41:56.846
whereas God's Cock is more like
melodic grindcore.

41:56.931 --> 42:00.391
So, it's five bands,
but it's four groups of guys.

42:01.977 --> 42:05.230
She is so nice.
I wish they'd hire more people like her.

42:07.107 --> 42:09.859
Can't believe he's still working here.

42:09.944 --> 42:12.195
Did you know
that Sylvia's wallet is missing?

42:12.279 --> 42:13.863
She thinks it was stolen.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.907
And guess who was
in the locker room last?

42:15.991 --> 42:17.367
Hector.

42:19.119 --> 42:20.537
Hey. Did you guys hear the rumor?

42:20.621 --> 42:22.288
Jim said Joel and Brian
are going to sell the company.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.040
Rich said the same thing, too.

42:24.124 --> 42:27.043
He said they'll probably make millions
and billions of dollars, too.

42:27.127 --> 42:28.711
Shut the fuck up.

42:28.796 --> 42:29.796
You mean, I'm working my ass off

42:29.880 --> 42:31.506
and those guys are gonna make
all that money?

42:31.590 --> 42:33.383
I work harder than anybody.

42:33.467 --> 42:37.220
If you add it all up,
I lift over 200,000 pounds a week.

42:37.304 --> 42:38.513
We should do something.

42:40.015 --> 42:42.976
Here. Ladies are free,
so bring some chicks.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.272
- You got a sec?
- Yeah.

42:47.356 --> 42:49.023
I think we might have
a really big problem here.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.400
I don't know what happened,
but all of a sudden,

42:50.484 --> 42:52.569
Step says he doesn't want
to settle anymore.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.529
I think he might have talked to a lawyer.

42:54.613 --> 42:57.240
Like I say, the General Mills guys
don't wanna make the offer official

42:57.324 --> 42:59.033
until this whole thing is settled, so...

42:59.118 --> 43:01.536
All right, well, don't worry about it.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.413
Step's probably just chest-beating,
you know?

43:03.497 --> 43:05.540
He does this all the time.
He gets all wound up, talks big,

43:05.624 --> 43:07.083
and then he usually backs down.

43:07.167 --> 43:09.294
And that was with his balls, so,

43:09.378 --> 43:12.547
- I'll talk to him.
- Okay. All right. The sooner the better.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.137
There he is. Hey.

43:20.347 --> 43:22.181
I can't talk today.

43:22.850 --> 43:25.101
- Almost missed you.
- I can't talk right now, Nathan.

43:25.185 --> 43:27.437
Hey, I noticed you got
a new pool cleaner today.

43:27.521 --> 43:28.688
How is he?

43:28.772 --> 43:30.481
We're thinking about
changing services.

43:30.566 --> 43:34.444
I got to get inside...
Hang on, you mean yesterday, right?

43:34.528 --> 43:36.154
- Huh?
- The pool cleaner that you saw,

43:36.238 --> 43:38.364
you saw him yesterday,
not today, right?

43:38.449 --> 43:40.450
No, today. The new guy.

43:43.078 --> 43:44.537
What did he look like?

43:44.622 --> 43:47.332
Well, you know,
blonde-haired kid about yea high.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.959
Good-looking kid. Real good-looking.

43:50.044 --> 43:51.294
In fact, Leslie even commented...

43:51.378 --> 43:53.463
You're absolutely sure
that you saw him today,

43:53.547 --> 43:54.881
and not yesterday?

43:54.965 --> 43:56.341
- Yeah.
- No doubt?

43:56.425 --> 43:59.469
No, no doubt about it. It was today.
I came home for lunch.

43:59.553 --> 44:02.221
Yesterday, I had this bear of
a sales conference.

44:02.306 --> 44:04.307
This guy just went on.

44:04.725 --> 44:07.977
Hey, do you think I could go ahead
and get that check from you?

44:08.062 --> 44:10.229
It's 110...

44:10.606 --> 44:12.607
All right, I'll call you!

44:15.361 --> 44:16.361
Hello?

44:16.445 --> 44:17.904
- Yeah, is this Brad?
- Yeah.

44:17.988 --> 44:19.405
What were you doing
at my house today?

44:24.745 --> 44:26.579
- Nothing.
- Bullshit.

44:27.247 --> 44:29.582
Look, don't worry about it, dude.

44:30.417 --> 44:31.417
I won't charge you for this one.

44:31.585 --> 44:33.503
You had sex with my wife again?

44:33.587 --> 44:38.341
Well, I figured we already did it once,
so what's the big deal, right?

44:38.425 --> 44:41.678
- Besides, I'm not going to charge you.
- You're not going to charge...

44:41.762 --> 44:43.513
You are going to charge me
and I am going to pay you,

44:43.597 --> 44:46.224
because you are not going to have sex
with my wife for free, all right?

44:46.308 --> 44:50.019
Now, listen. If I ever catch you
anywhere near my house ever again,

44:50.104 --> 44:52.397
it's not going to be great, all right?

44:52.481 --> 44:56.109
Okay, listen, if you know
of anyone else who needs...

45:01.073 --> 45:02.699
Hey, do you want to,

45:03.158 --> 45:04.951
I don't know, go out or something?

45:05.035 --> 45:07.370
We can go to 7-Eleven
and get pizza sticks.

45:07.454 --> 45:09.831
I have this work thing I gotta go to.

45:10.290 --> 45:12.667
Rory's band's playing.
Everyone's got to go.

45:56.170 --> 46:00.506
Are you getting what you deserve?
Call me! Joe Adler, the big gun.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.008
- Hey, Cliff.
- Hey.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.478
I cannot believe
that my wife slept with that guy.

46:14.563 --> 46:16.105
I thought you said
it wouldn't bother you.

46:16.190 --> 46:18.775
Well, I guess
I didn't think about it long enough.

46:18.859 --> 46:21.778
It was so easy for him, too.
I can't stand that.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.571
Maybe I'm just lousy in the sack.

46:23.655 --> 46:25.114
No, man. It's not your fault.

46:25.199 --> 46:28.534
I told you,
my man Brad just crushes ass, dude.

46:29.661 --> 46:32.121
I'm sorry if, you know... I'm sorry.

46:32.206 --> 46:34.957
That's all right. That's all right.
Apparently you're right.

46:35.501 --> 46:37.335
What is it with women?
They say they don't care about looks,

46:37.419 --> 46:38.669
they just want a guy
who's smart and funny,

46:38.754 --> 46:40.630
but they always just end up laughing

46:40.714 --> 46:42.799
at whatever the good-looking,
stupid guy says.

46:42.883 --> 46:44.675
I know.

46:44.760 --> 46:47.804
Guess what else? Little prick
was at my house again today.

46:47.888 --> 46:49.889
- For real? Why?
- Why do you think?

46:52.184 --> 46:55.812
Unreal. You hire a guy to do a job
on one day,

46:55.896 --> 47:00.983
and he comes back the next day,
drops it in your wife again for free.

47:01.068 --> 47:04.028
Yeah, well, I'm not letting him do it
for free. I am paying him.

47:04.112 --> 47:05.530
You are? How much?

47:05.948 --> 47:07.740
The same, I guess. Why?

47:08.659 --> 47:13.621
Well, I mean,
should I contact Brad for my 20 bills

47:13.705 --> 47:16.582
and invoice him,
or should I go to you, or...

47:18.126 --> 47:19.502
Don't even worry about that right now.

47:19.586 --> 47:21.337
We can deal
with the economics of it later.

47:21.421 --> 47:23.714
You can just table that.
That's not what's important.

47:23.799 --> 47:26.467
What's important is that
you should be going out right now

47:26.552 --> 47:29.554
and calling Cindy, guilt-free.
Conscience clear.

47:29.638 --> 47:32.056
Yeah. I don't know about that.
She's at that party.

47:32.140 --> 47:34.851
- Look. You know what you need to do?
- I don't need any more drugs.

47:34.935 --> 47:38.896
Dude. I know I kid around a lot
and I'm a little bit of a character,

47:38.981 --> 47:42.191
but I'm serious right now.
This is real advice.

47:42.276 --> 47:44.277
Okay? So, I want you to listen to me.

47:44.987 --> 47:47.738
You should try smoking a little pot.

47:48.699 --> 47:52.076
- That's a drug.
- It's not a drug. It's a flower.

47:52.327 --> 47:56.414
It has healing properties.
Stress is a killer.

47:56.498 --> 47:58.249
Okay, I get paranoid when I smoke pot.

47:58.333 --> 48:00.835
Not if you smoke a little, bro.

48:01.253 --> 48:02.545
You know what you need to do?

48:02.629 --> 48:04.088
You need to hang out
with my boy Willie.

48:04.172 --> 48:07.967
He's a great guy. He's the one
who gave me that horse tranquilizer.

48:09.803 --> 48:16.767
Dude, the Atlantians gave mankind
the secret 10,000 years ago.

48:17.227 --> 48:20.771
See, drugs don't give you a hangover,
man. You know what I mean?

48:20.856 --> 48:25.610
People are just now starting to use
that shit. Embrace it.

48:25.694 --> 48:28.404
That's how we're going to solve
modern problems, man.

48:28.488 --> 48:32.617
Wisdom of the ancients.
Ask Willie, bro. He's a shaman.

48:33.869 --> 48:34.994
Right on.

48:51.803 --> 48:53.054
- All right, man.
- No.

48:53.138 --> 48:56.140
I'm really kind of a lightweight. If you've
got a beer, or even some wine...

48:56.224 --> 48:57.642
- It's not really my thing.
- Bullshit.

48:57.726 --> 49:00.478
Come on, Joel.
Man, he thinks he gets paranoid.

49:00.562 --> 49:02.480
- I do get paranoid.
- Okay.

49:03.106 --> 49:05.107
You familiar with the Graffix bong?

49:05.192 --> 49:06.984
- You ever used one before?
- No.

49:07.069 --> 49:09.528
Okay. Put your thumb right here.

49:09.613 --> 49:12.865
Hey! You put your right thumb here,
on the carburetor.

49:12.950 --> 49:19.080
Now, when I tell you to let go,
I want you to let go and inhale hard.

49:19.706 --> 49:21.123
Okay. Exhale!

49:22.209 --> 49:23.584
- I'm going to let you guys do this.
- Bullshit!

49:23.669 --> 49:24.835
This doesn't work for me.
Just give mine to Dean.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.837
- Exhale hard!
- I get paranoid, so I don't...

49:26.922 --> 49:28.464
Exhale!

49:30.175 --> 49:32.051
Put your lips on it. Yeah.

49:34.262 --> 49:38.140
Go! Inhale! Go! Go! Harder!

49:39.935 --> 49:41.268
Let go!

49:41.353 --> 49:42.645
Inhale!

49:47.109 --> 49:48.734
Yeah.

49:51.321 --> 49:54.156
Oh, yeah.

49:59.663 --> 50:03.249
Yeah. It's Jesus. You see him?

50:17.431 --> 50:18.681
Oh, fuck.

50:35.449 --> 50:37.241
I thought I heard somebody
say something.

50:47.294 --> 50:48.544
Jesus Christ.

50:48.628 --> 50:50.796
Did you see the look on his face?

50:50.881 --> 50:54.050
Man, you do get paranoid
when you get stoned.

50:54.134 --> 50:55.384
You do, dude.

50:55.469 --> 50:57.219
Did you get paranoid
when he jumped at you?

50:57.304 --> 50:58.554
I told you guys.

50:59.139 --> 51:01.682
Hey, dude, man.
You should call that girl now.

51:01.767 --> 51:02.767
Well, yeah, what time is it?

51:02.851 --> 51:06.228
Time for you to call her
and finally get laid, man. Come on!

51:06.313 --> 51:07.855
- All right.
It's 12:30, man.

51:07.939 --> 51:09.732
She's probably at home now.

51:12.861 --> 51:14.278
What does she look like?

51:14.362 --> 51:19.658
She's... She has dark hair.
She's kind of pretty,

51:19.743 --> 51:22.828
and, you know, working-class looking.

51:25.373 --> 51:26.957
What do you mean by that?

51:33.090 --> 51:36.759
That she's kind of slutty-looking?

51:42.099 --> 51:44.433
Kind of. Yeah.

51:48.355 --> 51:50.064
That's how I like them.

51:51.358 --> 51:52.900
Kind of nasty. Yeah.

51:53.693 --> 51:55.778
You guys have the same taste, man.

51:57.197 --> 51:59.532
Yeah. Hope I don't wake her up.

52:02.828 --> 52:03.828
Busy.

52:03.912 --> 52:05.788
At least you know she's home, man.

52:05.872 --> 52:08.249
I don't know what kind of person
doesn't have call waiting.

52:09.501 --> 52:11.335
I don't have call waiting.

52:14.756 --> 52:17.091
I hate call waiting.

52:17.884 --> 52:20.094
Every time I hear that clicking,

52:21.888 --> 52:25.599
I put my fist
right through someone's skull!

52:34.734 --> 52:36.861
Are you joking? He's playing with you.

52:36.945 --> 52:41.365
You do get paranoid
when you are stoned, huh?

52:42.576 --> 52:47.329
Seriously, though, I hate call waiting.

52:47.414 --> 52:48.622
Okay, man.

52:49.249 --> 52:52.835
You're too stoned.
I'm gonna dial the number for you.

53:03.513 --> 53:06.932
I'll tell you
why you're getting a busy signal.

53:10.812 --> 53:12.813
This is my number.

53:18.653 --> 53:22.531
Enough. I don't know why
you're trying to get me so paranoid.

53:22.616 --> 53:23.949
You're gonna make me cry.

53:24.826 --> 53:25.910
Hey.

53:27.454 --> 53:28.537
Joel?

53:28.830 --> 53:31.498
Hey. What are you doing here?

53:33.501 --> 53:36.754
Joel, man, I'm not proud of you today.

53:36.838 --> 53:37.880
Guys, seems like

53:37.964 --> 53:39.715
- you guys will have a lot to work out.
- Hey, man.

53:39.799 --> 53:41.717
I don't want to be a fourth wheel.

53:42.260 --> 53:44.386
Thanks for having me. It's been cool.

53:45.430 --> 53:46.847
See you guys later.

53:54.940 --> 53:56.232
Kind of nasty?

54:10.330 --> 54:11.580
Shit.

54:14.501 --> 54:16.418
Oh, my God. Joel, are you all right?
What happened?

54:16.503 --> 54:21.840
I'm fine. I'm fine. Just got
my ass kicked. Just back to sleep.

54:22.467 --> 54:24.635
- But...
- Honey, just...

54:24.719 --> 54:26.136
By who? What happened?

54:26.221 --> 54:30.516
Some guy at Sidelines, just...
Night-night.

54:30.684 --> 54:33.102
My God, you should go to the hospital
so you can get checked out, maybe.

54:33.186 --> 54:35.354
No, no, no, I just
want to go to sleep right now.

54:36.481 --> 54:40.025
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Honey, just don't worry about it, okay?

54:40.110 --> 54:43.112
People get their asses kicked
every day. Not a big deal. Back to bed.

54:46.074 --> 54:48.284
- Can I get you some ice?
- I'm set.

54:52.038 --> 54:55.541
Hi, Joel. Brian wants to see you.
Oh, my God.

54:56.084 --> 54:57.501
What happened to your face?

54:57.585 --> 54:59.253
Car door. Slammed it.

55:02.257 --> 55:03.757
Hey, did you talk to Step yet?

55:03.842 --> 55:04.925
Not returning my calls.

55:05.010 --> 55:09.013
Oh, shit. We got trouble.
He did talk to a lawyer.

55:09.389 --> 55:13.767
Joe Adler, that personal-injury lawyer
you see on all the bus-stop bench ads.

55:13.852 --> 55:16.478
He's got that freak-show hairdo.
I mean, you got to see this guy.

55:16.563 --> 55:18.230
He is a human turd.

55:20.567 --> 55:22.443
Shit. What happened to you?

55:22.527 --> 55:24.862
I fell down some stairs. Joe Adler?

55:24.946 --> 55:27.031
Yeah. I mean,
this could be a real problem.

55:27.115 --> 55:28.699
We could be really screwed here.

55:29.242 --> 55:32.870
And we got to hire a couple of
new people because Cindy's quitting.

55:32.954 --> 55:35.581
And did you know
she's been going out with Step?

55:38.585 --> 55:39.626
What?

55:39.961 --> 55:41.003
Can you believe that?

55:41.087 --> 55:42.296
- Step?
- Yeah.

55:42.756 --> 55:44.840
- Our Step?
- I know. Weird.

55:44.924 --> 55:46.050
And they didn't even meet here.

55:46.134 --> 55:49.386
They met, like, at some grocery store
or something, totally random.

55:49.596 --> 55:52.181
You know, how a jimmy-john
little dingle berry like him

55:52.265 --> 55:54.433
ends up with a girl like Cindy
is beyond me.

55:56.811 --> 56:01.190
And if it's okay with you,
I'd like to go ahead and fire Hector.

56:02.650 --> 56:03.692
Fire Hector? Why?

56:03.777 --> 56:07.529
Well, you know, what's-her-face's
purse and dinkus' wallet.

56:08.281 --> 56:10.282
It's got to be him. Who else could it be?

56:12.619 --> 56:15.037
Uh, no. Do not fire Hector.

56:15.121 --> 56:17.748
- Why not?
- Just... Just trust me on this.

56:18.958 --> 56:20.542
Okay. If you say so.

56:21.586 --> 56:25.923
Jenny, I don't feel very well.
I'm gonna go home early.

56:33.765 --> 56:34.890
Shit.

56:42.023 --> 56:43.107
What the...

56:45.485 --> 56:48.445
What the hell are you doing
on my street again?

56:48.530 --> 56:51.031
Dude, you weren't supposed to be here
for another four hours.

56:51.116 --> 56:53.700
What... What happened to your face?

56:54.119 --> 56:55.494
Same thing that's...

56:55.578 --> 56:58.789
Your face is going to look like
my face if I ever...

56:58.873 --> 57:03.669
Actually, your face is going to
look worse than mine if...

57:04.462 --> 57:09.425
Listen, if I ever catch you anywhere
near my house or my wife again,

57:09.509 --> 57:12.052
at the very least, you will be arrested.

57:13.513 --> 57:16.056
For what? Suzie let me in.

57:19.352 --> 57:23.689
Listen, man, I know she's your wife
and shit and whatever.

57:24.190 --> 57:27.985
You might as well know,
I think we're in love.

57:29.904 --> 57:33.866
In love? Oh, are you stupid.

57:34.200 --> 57:37.911
Stupid Brad. Stupid, dumb, dumb Brad.

57:37.996 --> 57:41.999
You think that she is in love with you?
You don't even know her, okay?

57:42.083 --> 57:45.461
You're nothing but a little piece of ass.
That's it.

57:47.130 --> 57:48.464
I don't think so, dude.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.549
You don't think so, dude?
Did you ever think

57:50.633 --> 57:52.634
that she doesn't even know
that I paid you to have sex with her?

57:52.719 --> 57:53.802
Did you ever think about that?

57:53.887 --> 57:55.929
Did that ever skitter across
your little tiny brain?

57:56.014 --> 57:57.431
How about I go home
and I tell her right now

57:57.515 --> 58:00.350
that you did it all for money?
What about that, ding-ding?

58:00.435 --> 58:01.477
Shut up. You wouldn't do that.

58:01.561 --> 58:03.979
- Really? Watch this, slut.
- No!

58:04.063 --> 58:06.440
- Here I go.
- No, wait! Please!

58:06.983 --> 58:08.859
Don't! Man!

58:09.944 --> 58:15.073
Listen, man, me and your wife
got something really special going on.

58:15.158 --> 58:16.992
Please don't mess it up for me.

58:17.076 --> 58:20.412
Don't mess it up?
You're talking about my wife!

58:20.538 --> 58:23.457
My house! My pool! Stupid ass.

58:23.541 --> 58:26.043
No, wait! Come on!
You can't do this to me!

58:26.127 --> 58:27.586
Oh, yes, I can!

58:32.759 --> 58:34.218
Hi. You're home early.

58:34.302 --> 58:36.303
So, how was that new pool cleaner?

58:36.387 --> 58:37.721
What do you mean?

58:37.805 --> 58:39.473
What do you think I mean?

58:42.769 --> 58:45.395
Did he do a good job cleaning the pool?

58:47.482 --> 58:48.524
Well, I...

58:48.608 --> 58:51.693
Did he get all the leaves?
'Cause it doesn't look really clean.

58:51.778 --> 58:55.531
I'm looking right at it,
and it looks pretty goddamn filthy.

58:56.282 --> 58:59.243
Yeah, yeah.
It doesn't look like he did a good job.

58:59.327 --> 59:00.661
I think he did a horrible job,

59:00.745 --> 59:03.413
and I don't think
we're going to be using him anymore.

59:03.498 --> 59:04.831
- Okay.
- Okay?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.377
Are you sure you're feeling okay, Joel?
Can I take you to the doctor?

59:08.461 --> 59:09.503
Nope!

59:10.630 --> 59:11.755
- Do you want some aspirin?
- No, thank you!

59:11.839 --> 59:12.923
How about some raisins?

59:31.985 --> 59:33.819
- Hey, Step.
- Joel! Come on in.

59:33.903 --> 59:35.028
Great.

59:35.613 --> 59:37.406
This is my half-brother, Phil.

59:39.033 --> 59:40.993
- Well, let's go out back.
- All right.

59:41.327 --> 59:43.870
Hey, hey! Close the door.

59:44.706 --> 59:45.789
Sorry.

59:52.505 --> 59:54.673
So, you're dating Cindy, huh?

59:55.675 --> 59:58.343
Yes, sir. She's my girlfriend.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:03.348
We might even get married after all this
lawsuit settlement stuff gets settled.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.687
Step, you might want to be
careful with her.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.024
What do you mean?
Does she got an STD?

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:16.862
I just... Step, I'm not sure
how to put this,

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:19.197
but, you know,
you have got a lot of money

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:23.035
coming your way from the settlement.
You might want to be careful with her.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:29.750
Joel, I know Cindy has got
her problems, but she means well.

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.377
She's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:34.796
Step, I don't want to tell you what to do,

01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.549
but I just want you
to think about this, you know.

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:41.553
If you go beyond the settlement,
you continue with the lawsuit,

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.472
you could bankrupt that company.

01:00:43.556 --> 01:00:45.349
And people are going to lose their jobs,

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:47.392
a lot of people are gonna be
pissed off at you, so...

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:49.478
No, I ain't worried about that.

01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:52.189
I can kick anybody's ass
at that whole company.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:53.940
Yeah.

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:57.569
Well, I'm gonna kick somebody's
ass if you don't close that screen door!

01:00:58.738 --> 01:00:59.946
Brad, we can't. I'm sorry.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:02.282
- We have to stop doing this.
- Why?

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:05.118
Because it's not right,
and I feel horrible,

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:07.829
and you have to start cleaning the pool.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:15.671
But I've never felt this way
about anyone before,

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:17.964
and I've been with a lot of chicks.

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:25.347
Okay, look, Brad.
I love my husband. I really do.

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:29.810
And this was a mistake. I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into me.

01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:36.024
I was bored and frustrated,
and I was not feeling particularly pretty.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.276
But we just... We have to stop this.

01:01:38.736 --> 01:01:42.155
This has made me realize
I really want to make my marriage work.

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.408
I'm sorry.

01:01:44.742 --> 01:01:47.661
This doesn't mean that we can't still
see each other, though, right?

01:01:49.288 --> 01:01:51.748
Yes, that's...
That's exactly what it means.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:53.792
Why?

01:01:55.169 --> 01:01:57.879
Because of everything that I just said.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.007
Do you need me to say it again?

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:04.720
Can I see you tomorrow?

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:06.930
- No.
- Can I see you Thursday?

01:02:07.014 --> 01:02:08.557
- No.
- Can I see you Friday?

01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:11.143
Okay. You know what?
You have to go. Come on.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:16.148
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay. Okay. Just... Okay.

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:17.733
We'll talk about it later.

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:22.320
Oh, my God. What a moron.

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.201
Hey. Are you ready?

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:30.829
The meeting with Step's lawyer,
or lawyers.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:33.623
- It's today, remember? Now.
- Shit.

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:36.168
I should fire all three of you

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:39.963
because you laughed at me
when I bought those bus-bench ads.

01:02:40.047 --> 01:02:43.508
But this Step guy? He's the Holy Grail.

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:48.638
You see, if both his balls
had been knocked clean off,

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:51.641
he'd be a good case,
but not a great case.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:54.603
A man with no balls is no man at all.

01:02:54.687 --> 01:02:57.063
And a jury will never feel
they can walk in the shoes

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:59.900
of a ball-less, neutered, he-she freak.

01:03:00.401 --> 01:03:04.821
But Step? He's got one ball, barely.

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:11.369
To a jury he's still a man, and that
manhood is hanging on by a thread.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:15.081
I'm telling you,
this guy is a Powerball jackpot.

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:16.500
The fucking...

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:20.045
Hello. I'm Joe Adler.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:23.465
- Hi, Joe. Brian. This is Joel.
- Nice to see you.

01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:24.549
- How are you?
- Hi.

01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:25.842
You see those guys up there?

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.094
I heard those are the guys
from General Mills.

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:31.056
Look, if they're gonna sell this place
and cash out and leave me with no job,

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:32.849
then I should get some
of that cash, man.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.059
I mean, it's only fair.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:36.102
I've been working here for,
like, two years.

01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:38.772
It's bullshit, man. I work my ass off.

01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:41.149
Remember, Hector, I was telling you
how hard I worked my ass off?

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:45.278
I've been working here 14 years.
We can get jobs at GemCo like that.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.656
And at GemCo,
all the employees are owners.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.491
It even says so on the nametags.

01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:51.451
But the thing is,
I don't want to work at GemCo.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:53.036
GemCo sucks, man.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.205
They make you do calisthenics. Yeah.

01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:58.166
That's right.
We could work at Southwest Airlines.

01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:00.126
But I don't want to work
at Southwest, either.

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:02.087
They make you do the limbo.

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.505
That is messed up.

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:06.174
Yeah, I would be the laughingstock
of the grindcore community.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:08.134
If we quit, this place couldn't run.

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:10.679
They wouldn't be able to sell this place
for anything.

01:04:10.763 --> 01:04:15.183
Well, that's why what we should do is,
is we should all go on strike,

01:04:15.268 --> 01:04:18.520
demand stock in the company
before it sells.

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:20.647
If General Mills knew
that we were on strike,

01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:23.942
they would not buy this place
until that strike was over.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:28.154
See, that way, Joel and Brian
would have to give us stock.

01:04:30.324 --> 01:04:33.368
Yeah. We should do it.
We should strike.

01:04:33.452 --> 01:04:35.453
That's what I've been saying
this whole time.

01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:38.206
We've gone through everything,

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.710
and the only way we would even
consider a settlement

01:04:41.794 --> 01:04:45.046
would be to the tune of the number
you see on the bottom of Page 18.

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:46.756
Does everyone have this?

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:51.720
What?

01:04:51.804 --> 01:04:53.889
We don't have this kind of money,
not even close.

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:56.141
Not in cash, you don't. Of course not.

01:04:56.642 --> 01:05:00.228
But if you were to sell off your assets,
the property lease, the equipment...

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.731
Are you... Are you shitting me?
This would bankrupt us.

01:05:02.815 --> 01:05:04.399
This is what I've been trying
to tell you about, Joel.

01:05:04.483 --> 01:05:06.526
If you think that I'm just going to give up

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:08.570
this entire company
that I've built from the ground up...

01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:10.655
How about what my client gave up?

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.992
His testicles! How about that?

01:05:14.368 --> 01:05:16.328
In fact, I'll make a deal with you.

01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:19.581
We will drop this case right now

01:05:19.665 --> 01:05:24.544
if you come over here
and put your testicles right here

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:27.005
and let me slam this door like this!

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:31.259
Go ahead. We can settle this right now.

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:34.763
Call it even.
I will drop this case right now

01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:39.059
if you let me slam your balls
in this door,

01:05:39.143 --> 01:05:41.603
because that's what happened
to my client!

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:44.689
Yep. Those are definitely the guys
from General Mills.

01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:48.568
Now, you see that? That is
a negotiation going on right there.

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:51.112
That is definitely
what that looks like to me.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:53.156
What are we going to do?
I got car payments.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.033
They're going to take away my Geo.
They've done it before.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:57.452
We got to act fast.
They could be about to close the deal.

01:05:57.536 --> 01:06:00.205
Yeah, and leave us out in the cold.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.917
Are we going to lose our jobs?

01:06:04.001 --> 01:06:05.543
We very well could, Hector.

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:08.088
We need to do one of those walkouts.
That's what we need to do.

01:06:08.172 --> 01:06:11.174
All right. Who's in? We need a show
of force. Come on! It's now or never!

01:06:11.258 --> 01:06:12.425
Come on, people.

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:15.387
Let's go! Come on! Let's do this! Yeah!

01:06:17.181 --> 01:06:18.473
Let's go.
Let's do it.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:26.523
I will gladly come down on that price
if you go over there right now

01:06:26.607 --> 01:06:28.108
and slam your testicles in that door...

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:32.404
I don't want to slam my testicles in
the door. I want you to be reasonable.

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:35.448
- You won't even budge one penny?
- Like I said, if you slam your...

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.742
I'll slam your balls in that door!

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.330
I'm sorry. Did you just threaten me?

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:44.749
- Why don't you give it a rest?
- We need to cool off for just a minute.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.084
We'll be right back.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.630
I don't need this. I'm going home.

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:03.768
Yeah, what?

01:07:06.313 --> 01:07:07.397
What?

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.108
Um, what's up, Joel?

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:14.904
Basically, we were...
We were thinking...

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:21.870
We were just thinking...
Well, Rory had initially pointed out

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:24.956
that you guys are doing this deal
with General Mills,

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:31.129
and we just think that...
Well, we were considering the idea...

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:34.215
We think that maybe
we should get a piece of it.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.719
And, you know,
so what we decided is...

01:07:37.803 --> 01:07:40.096
What everybody has decided is
that if we don't,

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:44.225
then what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna...

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:47.771
Hang on. You want a piece? Right?

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:50.565
- Yeah.
- Yeah, if we could.

01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:52.901
How about the whole
goddamn company?

01:07:52.985 --> 01:07:54.069
- Sure.
You got it!

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.570
Everybody gets the whole place!

01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:58.031
You guys run it, okay?
Everybody's in charge.

01:07:58.115 --> 01:08:02.035
As of now. In fact, you guys can pay for
the new conveyor belt and the lawsuit.

01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:03.578
You can go meet with Adler, okay?

01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:07.332
He might slam your balls in the door,
but at least you'll be the boss. Okay?

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.884
So, was that good, or...

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.055
I was going to say more,
but you interrupted me, and I...

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:29.520
Our lunch buffet features
all the food you love at a great...

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.441
Vandella
will make the turn, he moves to second.

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:35.568
He's got himself a double.
Big turn at second.

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:37.737
He throws on the brakes.
He'll stay there.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:40.281
Well, he just
turned on that pitch. What can we say?

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:42.575
I think four innings
is all Berot can handle,

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.121
and he hasn't handled
the fourth inning. With rwo doubles...

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:48.372
Listen, Joel,
I need to tell you something.

01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:55.630
You've been really busy at the factory
for the last couple years,

01:08:55.714 --> 01:08:58.758
and ever since
I started working at home,

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:01.553
it seems like, I don't know,
maybe I just wasn't feeling

01:09:01.636 --> 01:09:04.305
- as pretty as I used to feel, and I just...
- You banged the pool cleaner.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:05.515
- What?
- Is that what you're trying to tell me?

01:09:05.599 --> 01:09:07.267
You had sex with Brad.

01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:10.687
- You knew?
- Yeah, I knew. I hired him.

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.604
Yeah, I know you hired him,
but how did you know that...

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:16.317
I didn't hire him to clean the pool.
I hired him to have sex with you.

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:17.402
What?

01:09:19.446 --> 01:09:21.781
Wait... Why?

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.493
I hired him to have an affair with you,

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:30.497
because I wanted to have an affair
and not feel guilty,

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:34.961
but I was very, very drunk, and I was
on some kind of a horse tranquilizer.

01:09:35.045 --> 01:09:38.381
Brad was getting paid?
You paid Brad this whole time?

01:09:38.465 --> 01:09:40.049
All 15 times?

01:09:42.094 --> 01:09:43.261
Fifteen?

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.555
- Yes.
- Jesus Christ.

01:09:45.639 --> 01:09:49.058
Has it even been 15 days?

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:53.354
Unbelievable.
How can you even sit down?

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:56.065
Wait, you wanted to have an affair
with another woman?

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.484
Um, yes, but I didn't.

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:00.695
Why didn't you just talk to me about it?

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:02.906
I was going to, but, you know,

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:06.993
Dean, you know, he gave me some pill.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.037
God, you asshole.

01:10:09.121 --> 01:10:10.705
- I'm the asshole?
- Yes! I'm leaving.

01:10:10.789 --> 01:10:12.123
Suzie, technically
I didn't even do anything.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:13.875
You could've just said,
"No, thanks, just clean the pool. "

01:10:13.959 --> 01:10:15.877
None of this would've happened
if you hadn't hired him.

01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:18.463
Hey, guys. Glad I caught you.

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:21.132
You guys hardly ever answer the door.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:23.384
- Now's not a really good time.
- I'm leaving.

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:26.554
When do you think
would be a good time, you think?

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:28.556
I don't know. I don't know.

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.558
- See, the thing is...
- How about tomorrow?

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:31.935
- You want to come by tomorrow?
- Great.

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:33.686
- Okay?
- What time?

01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:36.439
I don't know. Just sometime tomorrow
would be great.

01:10:36.523 --> 01:10:40.318
Okay, great. So, if you could go and
have that check, that would be great.

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:42.153
- It's 110.
- Okay.

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:45.406
- That's two plates at $55 a plate.
- Okay, okay.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.200
- I'm going to close this.
- Okay.

01:11:45.092 --> 01:11:46.426
- Joel?
- Hi.

01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:50.013
Hey, what...
How did you know that I was here?

01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:52.807
I'm actually staying here, too.
I thought I saw you, so...

01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:53.975
Come in. Sorry.

01:11:54.059 --> 01:11:57.520
Do you want something to drink?
I have soda.

01:11:57.896 --> 01:11:59.063
No, thanks.

01:11:59.773 --> 01:12:02.567
Listen, I am so sorry
about what happened with Willie.

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:05.737
He gets crazy.
That's why I had to move out,

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:08.197
so, have a seat.

01:12:11.076 --> 01:12:13.369
That's Mary's purse, right?

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:16.080
Right there. That's Mary's purse, right?

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:21.794
Uh, no, that's my bag. So, wait. How are
things at work? How is everybody?

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:31.387
This is Mary's purse, and you stole it.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.014
Am I right?

01:12:34.099 --> 01:12:38.061
Joel, that's my bag.
It probably just looks like hers.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:40.355
You know,
there's a lot of them out there.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:42.273
I have never seen another one.

01:12:43.275 --> 01:12:45.818
Or another teddy in a fucking tutu.

01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:52.492
Now, what are you doing with Step?

01:12:52.576 --> 01:12:54.952
You're the only reason
that he's suing this company, right?

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:58.873
Do you have any idea how much work
I put into building up that company?

01:12:58.957 --> 01:13:01.084
Do you have any clue? Do you care?

01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:04.462
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna take this.

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:06.172
If it really is your bag,
you can call the police,

01:13:06.256 --> 01:13:08.341
you can tell them that I stole it.
All right?

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:11.219
On second thought,
I'm gonna call them right now

01:13:11.303 --> 01:13:13.304
and I'm gonna tell them
that you stole it.

01:13:16.141 --> 01:13:18.810
- Joel, please don't.
- Why?

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.729
Joel, please don't call the police.
I'm on probation,

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.065
and I will go to jail for a really long time.

01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:25.233
Well, maybe you should have
thought about that

01:13:25.317 --> 01:13:27.110
before you started
ripping off my employees.

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:29.529
Joel, please? Listen, I promise you

01:13:29.613 --> 01:13:31.823
I will leave Step alone
and he will drop the lawsuit.

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:33.241
How do I know that?

01:13:34.034 --> 01:13:35.451
You can keep the bag.

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:38.746
If I don't leave Step alone,
if he doesn't drop the lawsuit,

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.665
then you can turn me in.

01:13:45.003 --> 01:13:48.423
Yeah, that...
And Sylvia's wallet and Jim's watch?

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.425
You got those? Can I have those, too?

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:59.559
I guess that works. I mean, great.

01:14:01.478 --> 01:14:04.063
I bet you weren't even
into food flavoring, were you?

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:08.734
What is your deal?
How do you end up like this?

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:12.155
Hey?

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:14.991
Hey? This is what I'm talking about.

01:14:15.075 --> 01:14:18.244
This manipulation here with the tears.
I'm not gonna fall for that.

01:14:18.328 --> 01:14:19.454
Forget it.

01:14:20.664 --> 01:14:24.375
You better not be faking it, okay,
because I'm actually feeling bad.

01:14:25.043 --> 01:14:26.085
Hello?

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:31.215
Are you faking it?

01:14:34.219 --> 01:14:40.099
Well, I'm sorry. You know, I just...
You know, I just...

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:43.811
I was just curious about
how somebody ends up like this.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.271
All right. Just...

01:14:49.067 --> 01:14:52.820
Very sorry. Okay? Don't worry about it.

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:57.492
I just thought I'd just ask how a...

01:15:21.099 --> 01:15:23.518
Cindy? Cindy?

01:15:25.562 --> 01:15:26.687
Shit.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.127
Who were you thinking of
when we were making love last night?

01:15:52.297 --> 01:15:56.676
Was it a good-looking stranger
or a close friend of mine?

01:15:59.596 --> 01:16:05.309
You didn't want to quit
when we was into it last night

01:16:08.772 --> 01:16:11.649
Joel hasn't been in all morning.
Can you believe that?

01:16:12.192 --> 01:16:14.277
If we come in late, we get in trouble.

01:16:18.615 --> 01:16:21.075
And Hector didn't steal it. Cindy did.

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:25.288
Can you believe that?

01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:28.624
Blaming Cindy just to protect Hector.
Typical.

01:16:34.798 --> 01:16:37.800
We really do need to go
to the grocery store, Step.

01:16:41.054 --> 01:16:42.722
You heard from Cindy lately?

01:16:42.806 --> 01:16:45.808
It's been over three days
since she borrowed your truck.

01:16:46.643 --> 01:16:48.561
Maybe we ought to call the cops
or something...

01:16:48.645 --> 01:16:52.398
Look, she'll be back, all right?
She wouldn't steal my truck.

01:16:52.482 --> 01:16:53.608
Okay.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:59.947
That's the last bottle of Pepsi.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:03.868
Maybe I'll just call Domino's
and have them deliver some Pepsi.

01:17:06.204 --> 01:17:09.457
Still, if she didn't steal your truck

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:12.543
and she didn't get into an accident,
what do you reckon...

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:16.005
Shut up about Cindy, already,
before I kick your fat ass!

01:17:18.383 --> 01:17:20.426
Domino's.
Hello, Mr. Wilkinson.

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:21.510
Hello.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:26.891
Hey.
- Hey, Brian.

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.309
Step's here to see you.

01:17:29.686 --> 01:17:32.355
Is he? Great. Bring him in.

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:34.690
He's outside at the loading dock.

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:39.362
He wants to talk to you alone out there
for some reason. You know?

01:17:39.446 --> 01:17:40.780
Man to man.

01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:47.912
I'm sick and tired of dealing
with that Adler fellow.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:53.084
Truth is, I just want my old life back.
I just wanna get back to work.

01:17:54.211 --> 01:17:57.505
You know? I'm a working man.
That's what I do.

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:01.509
The problem is,
if I bankrupt the company,

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:04.762
there won't be a job for me
to go back to.

01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:07.765
You don't have to bankrupt
the company.

01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:11.519
Well, if I drop the lawsuit,
you'll sell the company,

01:18:11.603 --> 01:18:16.190
and the new company, well, who'd
want to hire somebody with one ball?

01:18:16.608 --> 01:18:22.113
Well, you know, listen, I don't think
they're actually allowed to ask,

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:23.739
so you're okay.

01:18:26.076 --> 01:18:28.202
You know, I'm a working man, too,
Step. You know?

01:18:28.286 --> 01:18:32.581
I make extract. That's what I do.
You know? Vanilla.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:37.461
Cherry. Root beer. S'mores.

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:40.715
And a lot of people don't think that
that's very cool,

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:43.968
but I think that it is pretty cool, so,

01:18:45.637 --> 01:18:47.805
why would I want to sell this place?

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.810
I think that I just got distracted
with Dean and the drugs

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:55.688
and the gigolos and...

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.319
You know, what I'm saying is
that I'm thinking about maybe

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:04.155
not selling the company.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:07.408
That is, if there isn't a lawsuit.

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:10.327
There is going to be
that insurance money, Step,

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.079
so what do you think?

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:14.665
Yeah, that sounds fair to me.

01:19:16.877 --> 01:19:18.461
But under one condition.

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:21.005
What's that?

01:19:21.506 --> 01:19:23.507
You make me floor manager.

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:31.807
Hold the line!

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:34.351
Thank you.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.687
Okay.

01:19:37.981 --> 01:19:40.483
Everybody gather around! Listen up!

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:50.785
Okay. First of all, I want to say that
I've decided not to sell the company.

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:53.037
All right?

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:57.958
And, secondly, I'm making Step here
the new floor manager.

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:01.712
Anybody doesn't like that,
I hear they're hiring over at GemCo.

01:20:02.547 --> 01:20:05.257
Remember, though, at GemCo,
the owner doesn't know your names.

01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:06.634
You'll probably never even meet him.

01:20:06.718 --> 01:20:09.512
He's, like,
in some corporate office somewhere.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.555
Here, you know, I'm just upstairs.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.517
You can come up there and you can
tell me if you got a problem, okay?

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:16.101
That's all. Okay?

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.312
Step, the floor is yours.

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.316
You're not selling?

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:24.777
I'm not selling.

01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:27.321
You better start learning
their names, Brian.

01:20:30.033 --> 01:20:31.784
- You just go off to work and do...
- Yeah.

01:20:31.868 --> 01:20:36.038
Hey! You two get back to work!
Quit your yapping.

01:20:58.186 --> 01:20:59.436
Hey, man.

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:04.108
Look, I know you probably
want to kick my ass.

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:08.404
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm not gonna see Suzie anymore,

01:21:08.488 --> 01:21:10.114
so you don't have to worry.

01:21:10.615 --> 01:21:12.283
She's really into you, dude.

01:21:12.784 --> 01:21:16.036
I guess that's why
she married you and shit.

01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:17.746
Whatever.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:21.792
You're a really lucky guy,
and I'm sorry if I messed shit up.

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.586
Why'd you have to get hung up
on Suzie?

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:25.212
You could have any girl you want.

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:29.174
Yeah, but I want Suzie.
I can't have her.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:31.093
You had her 15 times.

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:33.470
Well, yeah.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:38.392
But she doesn't love me, dude.
It's just not the same.

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:42.104
- Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that.
- All right. You told me.

01:21:43.523 --> 01:21:45.274
All right. Later.

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:58.287
Hey, so, I was wondering,
I quit my landscaping job,

01:21:58.371 --> 01:22:02.207
and I don't really think I'm cut out
for the whole gigolo thing.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:07.546
You know? So, do you think
you might have, like, an opening

01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:10.591
or whatever at the extract plant?

01:22:10.675 --> 01:22:12.676
I'm not going to give you a job. Okay?

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:15.262
Yeah. Sorry.

01:22:21.728 --> 01:22:25.439
Or just come by the office
and fill out an application.

01:22:25.523 --> 01:22:27.191
I'll see what I can do, okay?

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:29.777
Cool. Thanks, man.

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.281
There he goes.

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:37.368
Johnny Horse-cock. Rolling.

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:41.789
You know, I'm starting to think
this might have been a mistake.

01:22:41.873 --> 01:22:44.500
- Really?
- Maybe it was my fault, you know?

01:22:44.584 --> 01:22:46.335
- Maybe it was your fault.
- No, it's yours.

01:22:46.419 --> 01:22:48.504
A lot of blame to go around here.

01:22:48.588 --> 01:22:52.925
I think there are some people
who just aren't meant to do drugs, Joel.

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:56.178
I think you're one of those people, man.

01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:04.269
Hello?

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.105
Shit.

01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:10.901
Why are you cleaning
the pool yourself?

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:12.695
New guy didn't work out?

01:23:12.779 --> 01:23:14.571
Yeah, no, didn't work out.

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:18.242
Boy, it's just hard
to get good help, huh?

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:19.451
Yeah.

01:23:22.372 --> 01:23:25.416
Hey. Did you get a chance
to write that check?

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:30.170
Nathan, Joel and I are not going
to that dinner. Okay?

01:23:31.214 --> 01:23:34.133
Gee, I wish you would have told me that
before I went and bought those tickets.

01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:36.760
Joel never agreed to it,
and neither did I.

01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:41.056
Well, it sure sounded like
you guys were coming.

01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:43.183
I mean, Leslie was going
to talk to you about it,

01:23:43.268 --> 01:23:45.102
but you don't return our calls.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:49.023
I mean, I already bought those tickets,
and they're non-refundable.

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:52.860
I really wish you guys had been
a little more clear with me.

01:23:54.946 --> 01:23:57.239
Well, then,
let me be clear with you now.

01:23:58.074 --> 01:24:01.744
When we say things like,
"I don't think so,"

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:03.537
or "I'm not sure,"

01:24:03.621 --> 01:24:08.208
or we close the door in your face,
that means, "No. "

01:24:08.293 --> 01:24:09.793
Why can't you get that?

01:24:10.336 --> 01:24:12.379
- Well, it...
- Shut up! Okay.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:16.008
Let me be even more clear
with you, Nathan.

01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:18.135
We don't like you.

01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:20.637
Is that clear enough for you?

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:24.433
You're dull. You talk too much.
You never listen.

01:24:24.517 --> 01:24:26.060
You're always in our yard.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:28.562
I don't know what the hell
you're barbecuing over there,

01:24:28.646 --> 01:24:30.189
but it stinks.

01:24:30.273 --> 01:24:34.026
You lay out in your front yard
and listen to your car radio!

01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:37.404
You are the worst neighbor
in the world.

01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:41.158
We don't like you. Is that clear enough
for you, Nathan? Is that clear?

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:42.534
Shut up!

01:24:42.827 --> 01:24:44.078
Nathan?

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.498
Nathan? Nathan?

01:25:19.864 --> 01:25:21.198
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:23.701 --> 01:25:25.035
Are you okay?

01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:29.957
I think I might have killed him, Joel.

01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:33.127
The last thing he heard was me
yelling at him to shut up.

01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:36.004
Well, he did talk a lot.

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:40.134
Yeah. He was going on and on.
I finally lost it.

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:43.262
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
Probably just a coincidence, you know.

01:25:43.346 --> 01:25:46.056
I don't know. I just...
I still feel really guilty about it.

01:25:46.349 --> 01:25:50.727
I actually told Leslie I would go
to that Rotary Club dinner tonight.

01:25:51.729 --> 01:25:54.106
She said Nathan
would have wanted it that way.

01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:55.899
I said I'd go to that, too.

01:26:02.073 --> 01:26:05.617
So, who was this woman that you
wanted to have the affair with, anyway?

01:26:05.702 --> 01:26:09.496
She was just some criminal drifter.

01:26:12.458 --> 01:26:13.500
It wasn't that great.

01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:16.879
You know, I thought that she was
really into food flavoring and...

01:26:16.963 --> 01:26:18.505
- Really?
- Yeah, I should have known better.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.257
Nobody's into food flavoring.

01:26:21.134 --> 01:26:23.552
Well, I don't know.
I mean, you guys sell a lot of that stuff.

01:26:23.636 --> 01:26:25.179
People are into it.

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:33.353
You should know, by the way,

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:35.939
I hired Brad.

01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:39.693
Yeah, I know. You told me that,
remember? The whole...

01:26:39.777 --> 01:26:43.363
No, sorry,
not for the sex thing or the pool.

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:45.949
I mean that I hired him for the factory.

01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:48.952
Why? He's a total moron.

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:51.705
Yeah, I know.
This is going to sound kind of weird,

01:26:51.789 --> 01:26:54.499
but I felt sorry for him.

01:26:55.418 --> 01:26:57.294
Yeah. So did I.

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:03.091
Well, my car's over here, so,

01:27:03.968 --> 01:27:06.970
I guess I'll see you at the Rotary Club?

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:10.432
Yeah, I'll see you there.

01:27:14.812 --> 01:27:16.063
Suzie?

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:19.399
Should we maybe just take one car?

01:27:20.568 --> 01:27:22.444
Yeah. We probably should.

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:24.404
Yeah.

01:27:26.699 --> 01:27:29.826
I thought that was
a surprisingly tasteful funeral.

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:33.997
Yes, it was. You know, when
I was looking down on him, I thought,

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:37.793
"This might be the longest
I've ever seen him with his mouth shut. "

01:27:37.877 --> 01:27:40.337
Yeah. I didn't expect
that many mourners.

01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:42.506
There were a lot of people there.

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:43.632
Yeah.

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:50.806
You have been
a friend of mine, rainy day woman

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:55.394
That woman of mine, she ain't happy

01:27:55.812 --> 01:27:59.106
Till she finds something wrong
and someone to blame

01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:00.857
If it ain't one thing,
it's another one on the way

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:05.362
Hey. You've reached Cindy.

01:28:05.446 --> 01:28:06.947
I'm not here, so leave a message.

01:28:10.493 --> 01:28:11.910
Where the hell is she?

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:17.749
How long does it take to get some
goddamned cigarettes around here?

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.506
Here you are, sir.

01:28:27.093 --> 01:28:28.552
What the fuck?

01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:24.649
Oh, rainy day woman

01:29:25.443 --> 01:29:29.696
I've never seem to see you for
the good times or the sunshine

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:35.452
You have been a friend of mine,
rainy day woman

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:36.995
Woman

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:43.791
