00:03.545 --> 00:06.966
I bought dad the<i> greatest</i> gift

00:03.545 --> 00:06.966
for Christmas.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.384
Wow, Michelle,

00:07.007 --> 00:09.384
a store-bought gift?

00:09.426 --> 00:10.970
No more

00:09.426 --> 00:10.970
homemade presents, huh?

00:11.010 --> 00:14.264
Not that I didn't love

00:11.010 --> 00:14.264
my "Tony The Tiger" earrings.

00:14.306 --> 00:19.436
Yeah, frosted flakes

00:14.306 --> 00:19.436
make<i> great</i> jewelry.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.690
Well, I still use my rice

00:19.478 --> 00:22.690
krispies retainer container.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.109
So, squirt,

00:24.525 --> 00:26.109
where's the great gift?

00:27.862 --> 00:29.154
Ta-da!

00:32.616 --> 00:35.410
So, squirt,

00:32.616 --> 00:35.410
where's the great gift?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.788
Right here. See?

00:35.452 --> 00:37.788
It's a party tie.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.540
Isn't it cool?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.291
Here's the cup holder

00:39.581 --> 00:41.291
so your hands are free

00:41.333 --> 00:42.877
to eat Christmas cookies.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.085
What do you think?

00:45.546 --> 00:47.422
I've never seen a tie so..

00:47.464 --> 00:49.925
Uh, uh, stiff.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.387
I'm sure dad

00:52.219 --> 00:53.387
will love it.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.681
Yeah, I got

00:53.428 --> 00:55.681
to wrap it<i> real</i> good

00:55.723 --> 00:57.558
so dad won't know

00:55.723 --> 00:57.558
what it is.

00:59.727 --> 01:00.895
Give it to him

00:59.727 --> 01:00.895
right now

01:00.936 --> 01:02.396
and he won't know

01:00.936 --> 01:02.396
what it is.

something so magical about it.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.656
Yeah, everybody's so happy,

You had to drag me

02:49.628 --> 02:51.338
to the dry cleaners

02:51.379 --> 02:53.548
on Christmas Eve,

02:51.379 --> 02:53.548
you know, the<i> one</i> day

02:53.590 --> 02:55.342
when everyone's picking up

02:53.590 --> 02:55.342
their Santa suits.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.385
You ever been mauled

02:55.383 --> 02:57.385
by 20 fat, jolly guys?

02:59.220 --> 03:00.597

03:04.893 --> 03:07.562

03:16.279 --> 03:17.948
over a Lego nativity scene.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.910
Alright, fine, well,

03:19.992 --> 03:21.910
I think I'll just go slip

03:21.952 --> 03:24.955
into my freshly-martinized

03:21.952 --> 03:24.955
Santa costume.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.957
Ho ho ho, Ebenezer.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.169
Jess, I have something

03:28.583 --> 03:30.169
that'll cheer you up.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.129
Hey, Michelle,

03:30.209 --> 03:32.129
you'll like this, too.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.131
Look at this gag gift

03:32.171 --> 03:34.131
I got for Joey.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.343
Oh, man, now I know why

03:35.465 --> 03:38.343
they call it a gag gift.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.804
(Becky)

03:39.511 --> 03:40.804
'It's a party tie.'

Look, you put

03:40.846 --> 03:43.390
your drink right there

03:43.431 --> 03:45.726
and then your hands

03:43.431 --> 03:45.726
are free to, uh..

03:45.767 --> 03:47.728
...point out exactly

03:45.767 --> 03:47.728
how ugly this thing is.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.814
That is the dumbest thing

03:49.188 --> 03:50.814
I've ever seen.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.607
So, Michelle,

03:50.856 --> 03:52.607
what do you think?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.776
Oh, it's hilarious.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.988
I'm just gonna put this present

03:54.818 --> 03:57.988
under the tree..

03:58.030 --> 03:59.364
...out in the forest.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.910
Hey, Jess, did you remember

04:00.908 --> 04:02.910
to pick up some mistletoe?

04:02.951 --> 04:05.954
Oh, yeah. Two hours

04:02.951 --> 04:05.954
and seven bucks later.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.541
Honey, that's parsley.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.421
Ripped off

04:12.086 --> 04:14.421
on Christmas Eve.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.424
Well, we'll just have to kiss

04:14.462 --> 04:17.424
under the garnish.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.552
Joy to the world.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.557
Mich-Michelle,

04:24.431 --> 04:25.557
what are you doing?

04:25.599 --> 04:27.559
That's dangerous.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.559
What is this?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.728
Something I want

04:27.601 --> 04:29.728
to burn.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.271
Something you wanna<i> burn?</i>

04:31.312 --> 04:32.856
"To daddy, love.."

04:32.898 --> 04:34.482
It's a present

04:32.898 --> 04:34.482
for your dad.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.819
I saved all my milk money

04:34.524 --> 04:37.819
so I could buy it for him.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.404
So, why do you want

04:37.861 --> 04:39.404
to torch it?

04:39.446 --> 04:42.616
Because it's the dumbest thing

04:39.446 --> 04:42.616
you've ever seen.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.618
Oh, Michelle,

04:42.657 --> 04:44.618
I wouldn't say that.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.962
Actually, I-I did say

04:52.960 --> 04:54.962
that, didn't I?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.381
Can you take me back

04:56.797 --> 04:58.381
to the store?

04:58.423 --> 04:59.841
I gotta exchange it.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.927

04:59.883 --> 05:01.927

[shudders]

05:02.970 --> 05:04.429

05:04.471 --> 05:06.347
Listen, can't-can't you just

05:04.471 --> 05:06.347
make your dad something?

05:06.389 --> 05:09.184
I-I-I know there's-there's

05:06.389 --> 05:09.184
plenty of cereal in the kitchen.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.897
And I know he's been hinting

05:10.894 --> 05:13.897
for a fruit-loop sombrero.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.066
I made him that

05:13.939 --> 05:16.066
two years ago.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.567
Please take me

05:16.108 --> 05:17.567
to the store.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.111
Please, please,

05:17.609 --> 05:19.111
please.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.948
No pouting,

05:20.988 --> 05:22.948
no whining

05:22.990 --> 05:24.491
and no quivering

05:22.990 --> 05:24.491
of the lip, okay?

05:24.532 --> 05:25.951
Nothing is gonna work.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.620
Even if it's my first year

05:25.993 --> 05:28.620
I ever bought a present

05:28.662 --> 05:30.497
and dad's gonna hate it?

05:30.538 --> 05:33.541
And this could

05:30.538 --> 05:33.541
scar me for life?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.585
Guilt will work.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.585
Guilt is good.

05:35.627 --> 05:38.505
I didn't-I didn't say

05:35.627 --> 05:38.505
guilt earlier, did I?

05:38.546 --> 05:39.840
Here we go.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.840
Put your jacket on.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.716
Let's hurry, please.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.716
It's Christmas Eve.

Keep going, keep going,

05:42.843 --> 05:44.719
keep going.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.471
Oh.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.265
It won't close.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.642
I can't believe how

05:48.307 --> 05:50.642
much weight I've gained.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.144
You know what it is?

Chocolate boing-boings

05:52.186 --> 05:54.353

05:56.231 --> 05:58.608

05:56.231 --> 05:58.608
excess boing-boings

05:58.650 --> 06:00.694
make your arms longer.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.654
You know, Steph,

06:00.735 --> 06:02.654
you're absolutely right.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.031
I know what it is.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.574
The dry cleaner gave me

06:04.072 --> 06:06.574
the wrong Santa suit.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.660
Well, you can't disappoint

06:06.616 --> 06:08.660
Nicky and Alex.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.287
You just have to try

06:08.702 --> 06:10.287
and squeeze into the thing.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.788
You're right.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.540
Look, on three, Steph,

06:11.830 --> 06:13.540
I'll push from the bottom

06:13.581 --> 06:15.374
you pull from the top,

06:13.581 --> 06:15.374
and Joey, you close the belt.

- Ah!

Get up. Get up.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.554
Oh, man!

Oh, Joey!

- It's stuck, ow, Joey!

06:40.025 --> 06:41.442
- It's stuck, ow!

06:41.484 --> 06:43.904
Santa's hurting them.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.530
He's a monster.

- You're stepping on my feet.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.366
- Monster!

Hey, guys. Whoa, whoa.

What's the matter?

06:49.617 --> 06:50.660
What's wrong?

06:50.702 --> 06:52.453
It's Santa.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.705
He's scary.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.374
'No. Ho ho, damn!'

06:55.414 --> 06:56.875
Uh, Santa's not

06:55.414 --> 06:56.875
hurting anyone.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.086
- Ow!

06:56.917 --> 06:59.086
- Except her.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.004
Monster! Aah!

07:01.046 --> 07:02.964
Guys, guys, guys!

07:03.006 --> 07:05.717
<i>[Instrumental "Jingle Bells"]</i>

07:32.493 --> 07:34.371
Excuse me, could you just

07:32.493 --> 07:34.371
open up for a second, please?

07:34.413 --> 07:36.790
- We're closed.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.790
- It's an emergency!

07:36.831 --> 07:38.583
I don't care about an emergency.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.583
We're closed.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.086
I can't-I can't hear

07:38.625 --> 07:41.086
what you're saying.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.712
I can't hear

07:41.128 --> 07:42.712
what you're saying.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.340
- I said we're closed.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.340
- This will just take a moment.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.219
Hello, Mr. Dreghorn,

07:47.134 --> 07:49.219
remember me?

07:49.261 --> 07:51.305
Yeah, I remember you,

07:49.261 --> 07:51.305
you're the little girl

07:51.346 --> 07:52.889
with a big bag of nickels.

07:52.931 --> 07:55.683
Right. I accidentally bought

07:52.931 --> 07:55.683
this stupid gift.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.977
Stupid gift?

07:57.018 --> 07:58.270
You know how many

07:57.018 --> 07:58.270
of those stupid things

07:58.312 --> 07:59.854
I sell a year?

07:59.896 --> 08:01.564
Well, I know two

07:59.896 --> 08:01.564
for sure.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.985
Well, I'd like

08:03.566 --> 08:04.985
to exchange it.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.321
Have you got

08:05.026 --> 08:07.321
your receipt with you?

08:07.362 --> 08:08.696
- Um, at home, maybe.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.696
- No, no, no.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.740
Look, now,

08:08.738 --> 08:10.740
we-we-we have to close.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.159
- Would you mind leaving?

08:10.782 --> 08:12.159
- Hold on.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.534
- Right now.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.534
- I know, w-w-wait a minute.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.702
Wait a minute,

08:13.576 --> 08:14.702
I don't understand here.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.079
Now, you say

08:14.744 --> 08:16.079
you recognize her.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.622
Why can't you

08:16.121 --> 08:17.622
just exchange it?

08:17.664 --> 08:19.291
I mean, come on,

08:17.664 --> 08:19.291
it's-it's Christmas Eve, man.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.959
Well, it's great

08:19.333 --> 08:20.959
you know the date.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.377
But it's too bad you

08:21.001 --> 08:22.377
don't know what time it is.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.795
- You know what time it is?

08:22.419 --> 08:23.795
- No, what?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.380
It's quitting time.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.380
We're closed. That's it.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.507
I'm gonna make this, I'm gonna

08:25.422 --> 08:27.507
make this very simple.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.050
Excuse me.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.050
Just, just one second.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.594
Now, this-this-this tie thing,

08:29.092 --> 08:31.594
it cost 5 bucks.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.013
- Yeah?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.013
- Excuse me, sir.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.056
And, uh...and well,

08:33.054 --> 08:35.056
see this thing here

08:35.098 --> 08:36.350
this thing here,

08:35.098 --> 08:36.350
this cost 5 bucks.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.893
[high-pitched laughter]

08:41.396 --> 08:42.481
You think your dad

08:41.396 --> 08:42.481
will like this?

08:42.563 --> 08:44.565
- Who wouldn't?

08:42.563 --> 08:44.565
- Good.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.693
See? Even exchange.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.693
Everyone's happy.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.236
Thank you

08:46.734 --> 08:48.236
and Merry Christmas.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.447
Now, wait

08:48.278 --> 08:50.447
a minute, sideburns.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.450
You're not

08:51.698 --> 08:53.450
going anywhere.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.285
Put the laugh box back.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.953
No, no, no.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.953
I-I-I am gonna go somewhere.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.455
What I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna

08:56.995 --> 08:58.455
put this on the counter.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.457
Come on, Michelle,

08:58.497 --> 09:00.457
we'll put this on the counter

09:00.499 --> 09:01.708
we're going to take

09:00.499 --> 09:01.708
the laugh box.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.668
Even exchange.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.668
Everyone's happy.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.214
Hey, hey.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.214
What are you doing?

09:07.255 --> 09:08.923
I just touched

09:07.255 --> 09:08.923
the secret alarm.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.550
The police will be here

09:08.965 --> 09:10.550
any minute.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.636
You too are gonna spend

09:10.591 --> 09:13.636
Christmas Eve in jail!

09:14.846 --> 09:16.056
You can't make us stay..

09:16.097 --> 09:17.724
[high-pitched laughter]

09:19.934 --> 09:21.728
It's not funny.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.104
It's killing me.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.023
[high-pitched laughter]

09:27.192 --> 09:28.443
Open this thing.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.530
Hey!

09:40.372 --> 09:41.998
I don't get it, man,

09:40.372 --> 09:41.998
you know, we were just trying

09:42.040 --> 09:43.791
to exchange a gift,

09:42.040 --> 09:43.791
it's not like we were stealing.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.503
Save it

09:43.833 --> 09:46.503
for the police, Brylcreem.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.092
A, it's mousse.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.929
And two,

09:53.718 --> 09:55.929
bring those cops on, okay?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.347
Because I'm gonna charge

09:55.970 --> 09:57.347
you with fraud.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.473
- Fraud?

09:57.389 --> 09:58.473
- Kidnapping.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.891
Kidnapping?

09:59.933 --> 10:00.975
And failure to exchange

09:59.933 --> 10:00.975
a cruddy gift.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.019
- Cruddy gift?

10:01.017 --> 10:03.019
- Mm-hmm.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.897
Mr. Dreghorn,

10:03.061 --> 10:05.897
if you let us go

10:05.939 --> 10:08.149
you wouldn't have to be stuck

10:05.939 --> 10:08.149
here on Christmas Eve.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.110
Well, I don't mind,

10:08.191 --> 10:10.110
little girl

10:10.151 --> 10:13.821
sitting here

10:10.151 --> 10:13.821
until justice...is served.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.784
Yeah, and after that

10:15.574 --> 10:17.784
he's probably gonna go out

10:17.825 --> 10:19.453
and bag some reindeer.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.497
Say, Grinch, you mind

10:20.745 --> 10:22.497
if I have some water?

10:22.539 --> 10:25.292
No, go on.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.292
Help yourself. Dig a well.

10:29.421 --> 10:32.006
[laughing]

10:34.551 --> 10:37.429
He fell for the old

10:34.551 --> 10:37.429
dribble glass, Michelle.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.805
That's rich.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.976
I mean, here's a towel,

10:41.600 --> 10:42.976
Uncle Jesse.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.561
No, no, no.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.561
Don't touch that.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.728
Oh, just put it

10:44.603 --> 10:45.728
on my bill.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.481
(Dreghorn)

10:45.770 --> 10:47.481
'Suit yourself.'

10:50.275 --> 10:51.901
[laughing]

10:56.448 --> 10:58.450
[laughing]

11:02.912 --> 11:06.082
So, you kids

11:02.912 --> 11:06.082
pretty excited

11:06.124 --> 11:08.502
about Santa coming

11:06.124 --> 11:08.502
here tonight?

11:08.543 --> 11:09.961
Santa's coming here?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.421
Oh, yes.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.421
Santa's coming here.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.713
He waits

11:11.463 --> 11:12.713
till we're all asleep

11:12.755 --> 11:14.132
and then he sneaks

11:12.755 --> 11:14.132
into the house.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.259
We lock the door, right?

11:16.301 --> 11:17.802
Oh, it doesn't matter

11:17.844 --> 11:19.596
Santa just slides right down

11:17.844 --> 11:19.596
the chimney to get in.

11:19.638 --> 11:22.681
I'll hide under the covers.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.018
No. Hiding under the covers

11:22.723 --> 11:25.018
won't help.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.812
No. He-He sees you when you're

11:25.059 --> 11:27.812
sleeping, when you're awake.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.231
You guys better be good 'cause

11:27.854 --> 11:30.231
Santa Claus is coming tonight.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.275
Santa's coming?

11:33.692 --> 11:34.819
Santa's coming!

11:34.861 --> 11:37.696
Santa's coming!

11:39.157 --> 11:40.867
Danny, did I happen

11:39.157 --> 11:40.867
to mention to you

11:40.908 --> 11:43.495
that the boys are terrified

11:40.908 --> 11:43.495
beyond words of Santa?

11:44.579 --> 11:46.039
No, but maybe

11:44.579 --> 11:46.039
that would explain

11:46.080 --> 11:48.707
why they ran out

11:46.080 --> 11:48.707
in a total panic.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.960
Do you wanna help me pry them

11:48.749 --> 11:50.960
from under the couch?

11:52.253 --> 11:53.588
Yep.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.592
I can't believe it.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.592
It's Christmas Eve

11:57.634 --> 11:59.969
and I'm stuck

11:57.634 --> 11:59.969
in Scrooge's fun house.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.224
Oh, Uncle Jesse,

12:02.055 --> 12:04.224
you dropped a dollar.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.184
Oh, thanks, Michelle.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.395
Must have fallen out

12:06.226 --> 12:08.395
of my pocket.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.273
That's three in a row

12:12.315 --> 12:15.026
we got this yahoo,

12:12.315 --> 12:15.026
Michelle.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.070
"Must have fallen out

12:15.068 --> 12:17.070
of my pocket."

12:18.572 --> 12:20.365
Hey, who's side

12:18.572 --> 12:20.365
are you on, anyway?

12:20.407 --> 12:21.782
Sorry, Uncle Jesse.

12:21.824 --> 12:22.950
It was just a joke.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.369
Yeah, I got news

12:22.992 --> 12:24.369
for both of you, okay?

12:24.411 --> 12:25.870
The joke is over,

12:24.411 --> 12:25.870
if the cops

12:25.912 --> 12:27.372
wanna arrest me,

12:25.912 --> 12:27.372
they can do it at my house.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.082
'cause I'm getting out of here

12:27.414 --> 12:29.082
if I have to blast

12:29.123 --> 12:30.958
my way through

12:29.123 --> 12:30.958
with an exploding cigar.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.751
Now, wait a minute.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.751
Hold it, Fonzie.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.464
I got in touch with the police

12:34.462 --> 12:36.464
20 minutes ago

12:36.506 --> 12:38.091
and told 'em

12:36.506 --> 12:38.091
it was a false alarm.

12:38.132 --> 12:41.052
You what? And you kept us

12:38.132 --> 12:41.052
in here the whole time?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.721
Is this another one

12:41.094 --> 12:42.721
of your stupid jokes?

12:42.761 --> 12:44.305
Now, don't blow your top.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.933
We don't want to start

12:44.347 --> 12:46.933
a grease fire in here.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.438
You really wanna get

12:50.061 --> 12:51.438
out of here?

12:51.479 --> 12:53.398
Yes, I'd like to get out,

12:51.479 --> 12:53.398
it's Christmas Eve

12:53.440 --> 12:54.941
and I'm not

12:53.440 --> 12:54.941
with my family.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.487
Alright, you want to go,

12:57.026 --> 12:59.487
okay, I'll..

12:59.529 --> 13:00.988
- I'll let you out.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.988
- Thank you.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.616
Okay.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.326
Look at this guy.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.326
Let's go, Michelle.

13:05.368 --> 13:08.121
That's the most ridiculous thing

13:05.368 --> 13:08.121
I've ever heard.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.627
Michelle, put the glasses away,

13:11.040 --> 13:13.627
put the cigar out

13:13.668 --> 13:16.087
and let's go get

13:13.668 --> 13:16.087
Christmas over with.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.005
See? This is exactly

13:16.129 --> 13:18.005
what I'm talking about.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.674
These are the kind of people

13:18.047 --> 13:19.674
I've been dealing with all day.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.051
You know, does he care

13:19.716 --> 13:22.051
about his fellow man? No.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.679
Does he care that we have family

13:22.093 --> 13:24.679
waiting at home? No.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.307
He's probably having Santa's

13:24.721 --> 13:27.307
sleigh towed as we speak.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.017
- Come on.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.017
- Wait, Uncle Jesse.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.269
Maybe he locked us in

13:31.311 --> 13:33.229
so he wouldn't be alone

13:31.311 --> 13:33.229
on Christmas Eve.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.565
Michelle, listen to me.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.565
He doesn't care about us.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.609
So, we don't have to care

13:35.607 --> 13:37.609
about him. Let's go home.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.193
Look, you-you wanted to go home.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.321
Both of you, get out.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.321
Come on, let's go.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.030
Mr. Dreghorn,

13:41.362 --> 13:43.030
what are you doing tonight?

13:43.072 --> 13:44.574
Never mind, little girl, I..

13:44.616 --> 13:46.409
...I have big<i> plans</i> tonight.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.286
Good, have your big plans,

13:46.451 --> 13:48.286
go have dinner with your family

13:48.328 --> 13:49.912
and drive<i> them</i> crazy.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.624
My family, huh?

13:52.666 --> 13:53.832
Which family

13:52.666 --> 13:53.832
are you talking about?

13:53.874 --> 13:56.377
The one

13:53.874 --> 13:56.377
that doesn't write me?

13:56.419 --> 13:58.588
Or the one

13:56.419 --> 13:58.588
that never phones me?

14:08.973 --> 14:11.434
You're not gonna spend

14:08.973 --> 14:11.434
Christmas Eve with your family?

14:11.476 --> 14:15.021
Forget about my family.

14:11.476 --> 14:15.021
Forget 'em!

14:15.062 --> 14:16.648
They forgot about me

14:15.062 --> 14:16.648
a long time ago.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.024
They went up to Oregon

14:18.065 --> 14:19.693
took my grandchildren

14:18.065 --> 14:19.693
with 'em.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.402
I haven't talked

14:19.734 --> 14:21.402
to 'em for years.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.740
- Why didn't you go with 'em?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.740
- Why didn't I go with 'em?

14:25.782 --> 14:29.118
I had to stay here,

14:25.782 --> 14:29.118
and take care of this<i> fun box.</i>

14:31.579 --> 14:32.789
Besides, they..

14:33.956 --> 14:35.625
...they-they

14:33.956 --> 14:35.625
never asked me.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.005
Swallow your pride,

14:38.419 --> 14:41.005
Dreghorn.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.549
Get your butt up there

14:41.047 --> 14:42.549
and see 'em.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.425
I mean,

14:42.590 --> 14:44.425
family is everything.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.926
You don't know

14:44.467 --> 14:45.926
what you're missing, man.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.220
I don't know

14:45.968 --> 14:47.220
what I'm missing, man?

14:47.261 --> 14:49.138
I know what

14:47.261 --> 14:49.138
I'm missing,<i> man.</i>

14:49.180 --> 14:50.306
I don't need to be told

14:50.348 --> 14:52.684
by a-a walking..

14:52.726 --> 14:54.394
...oil slick.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.733
I'm-I'm sorry.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.733
I was just trying to help.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.943
Well, then leave.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.320
That'd help.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.534
Merry Christmas.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.035
Merry Christmas.

15:15.456 --> 15:19.043
Uncle Jesse,

15:15.456 --> 15:19.043
it's Christmas Eve.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.962
Can't Mr. Dreghorn have

15:19.085 --> 15:21.962
dinner at our house?

15:22.004 --> 15:25.299
Why would I want

15:22.004 --> 15:25.299
to do a thing like that?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.009
So you wouldn't be lonely.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.429
Lonely?

15:27.051 --> 15:29.429
I'm not lonely, little girl.

15:30.805 --> 15:33.224
You don't fool me

15:30.805 --> 15:33.224
one bit, Dreghorn.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.811
I can see it

15:34.642 --> 15:36.811
in your eyes, pal.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.021
You're not this grumpy guy

15:36.853 --> 15:39.021
you appear to be.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.189
And I'll tell you

15:39.063 --> 15:40.189
something else.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.941
I know, in your heart

15:41.982 --> 15:43.693
you don't wanna stay here

15:41.982 --> 15:43.693
Christmas Eve

15:43.735 --> 15:45.945
locked in a place

15:43.735 --> 15:45.945
with a bunch of whoopee cushions

15:45.986 --> 15:48.948
and-and-and rubber vomit.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.409
Now, wait a minute, be careful

15:48.989 --> 15:51.409
how you talk about..

15:51.451 --> 15:55.413
...about th-that's genuine,

15:51.451 --> 15:55.413
made-in-the-USA regurgitation.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.374
That..

15:59.667 --> 16:02.879
Oh, jeez.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.879
What are we talking about?

16:02.921 --> 16:04.464
Hey, I-I'm sorry.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.883
I didn't mean to make fun

16:04.505 --> 16:06.883
of your merchandise here.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.509
I know this is, uh..

16:08.551 --> 16:10.887
...this is-this is quality

16:08.551 --> 16:10.887
puke you got going on here.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.096
[laughing]

16:13.264 --> 16:14.474
I gotta apologize to you.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.685
I'm sorry about the crack

16:14.515 --> 16:17.685
about oil slick.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.480
Even though you are

16:17.727 --> 16:20.480
a quart low.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.403
Hey, listen, uh,

16:24.609 --> 16:27.403
that offer's still good.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.029
We'd love you, we'd love you

16:27.445 --> 16:29.029
to come over

16:29.071 --> 16:30.490
and have Christmas Eve

16:29.071 --> 16:30.490
with us.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.950
Please say yes.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.578
I don't think I can.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.955
I-It would mean

16:35.620 --> 16:36.955
so much to the kid.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.624
Yeah, it'd mean a lot

16:36.996 --> 16:39.624
to the kid.

16:42.126 --> 16:46.339
Yeah, you know, she is about

16:42.126 --> 16:46.339
the age of my granddaughter.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.757
Alright, good. Let's go.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.757
Let's go have some food.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.049
No, wait a minute,

16:47.799 --> 16:49.049
listen, there's something

16:49.091 --> 16:50.301
I've been wanting to do

16:50.343 --> 16:51.594
now, I've wanted to do it

16:50.343 --> 16:51.594
for a long time

16:51.636 --> 16:53.471
and I'm going to do it now,

16:51.636 --> 16:53.471
wait for me.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.769
Uncle Jesse,

16:56.766 --> 16:59.769
are you happy now?

16:59.811 --> 17:01.729
Yeah.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.190
I think inviting Dreghorn over

17:01.771 --> 17:04.190
was a great idea.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.193
I've been

17:05.775 --> 17:07.193
bellyaching all day

17:07.234 --> 17:09.821
about no one having any

17:07.234 --> 17:09.821
Christmas spirit.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.198
Problem wasn't

17:09.863 --> 17:12.198
with everyone else.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.407
The problem was

17:12.239 --> 17:13.407
with me.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.702
You lost

17:13.449 --> 17:15.702
your Christmas spirit?

17:15.743 --> 17:18.329
Yeah, I'm afraid

17:15.743 --> 17:18.329
I did.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.164
But you know

17:18.371 --> 17:20.164
something?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.166
I think I'm starting

17:20.206 --> 17:22.166
to get it back.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.127
Merry Christmas,

17:23.835 --> 17:25.127
munchkin.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.421
Merry Christmas,

17:25.169 --> 17:27.421
Uncle Jesse.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.134
You did a good thing.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.594
I gotta hand it to you.

17:33.636 --> 17:34.637
[buzzing]

17:34.679 --> 17:36.597
Ah!

17:36.639 --> 17:37.640
I got you again.

17:37.682 --> 17:38.892
You got me again.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.603
(Rebecca)

17:41.060 --> 17:42.603
"But I heard him say

17:42.645 --> 17:44.689
"as he drove out of sight

17:44.731 --> 17:46.816
"Happy Christmas to all

17:46.858 --> 17:48.985
and to all a goodnight."

17:50.069 --> 17:51.821
Santa gone yet?

17:52.780 --> 17:54.532
Santa's gone.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.075
- Good.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.496
So, Becky, how's the Santa

17:57.785 --> 18:00.496
conditioning going?

18:00.538 --> 18:02.665
Well, I think if we show 'em

18:00.538 --> 18:02.665
a few more positive images

18:02.707 --> 18:04.959
we can move 'em up

18:02.707 --> 18:04.959
from a hate to a strong dislike.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.004
Well, what could be more

18:06.126 --> 18:08.004
positive than..

18:08.046 --> 18:09.797
...Santa cookies?

18:09.839 --> 18:12.008
See how cute he is?

18:09.839 --> 18:12.008
Look at that. There you go.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.551
Oh, look at that.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.096
He tastes<i> good.</i>

18:17.137 --> 18:18.765
Yeah, and this year

18:17.137 --> 18:18.765
he's fat-free.

18:18.806 --> 18:19.933
Take a look,

18:18.806 --> 18:19.933
see, his-his belly's

18:19.974 --> 18:21.851
a little bit

18:19.974 --> 18:21.851
thinner this year.

18:21.893 --> 18:24.938
[bells jingling]

18:26.480 --> 18:28.900
Look who's here. It's Comet,

18:26.480 --> 18:28.900
the wet-nosed reindeer.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.484
[whining]

18:30.526 --> 18:33.654
And he's pulling a big, fluffy,

18:30.526 --> 18:33.654
harmless-looking Santa.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.824
Yes, so you can have Santa

18:33.696 --> 18:36.824
on your laps for a change.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.117
Here, try it.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.288
He's soft.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.206
See that?

18:42.329 --> 18:44.206
Santa loves you.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.587
Well, mission accomplished.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.755
I think we finally

18:49.629 --> 18:50.755
got them

18:50.797 --> 18:52.673
over their Santa

18:50.797 --> 18:52.673
Claus-trophobia.

18:52.715 --> 18:53.716
[laughing]

18:53.758 --> 18:56.094
(Joey)

18:53.758 --> 18:56.094
'Ho ho ho!'

18:56.135 --> 18:57.887
I guess Joey found

18:56.135 --> 18:57.887
another suit.

18:57.929 --> 19:01.307
Ah, guys, that sounds

18:57.929 --> 19:01.307
like Santa's helper.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.183
Are you ready

19:01.348 --> 19:03.183
to meet him?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.103
Yeah.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.980
Ho ho hippety-hop ho!

19:08.481 --> 19:09.482
Monster!

19:09.523 --> 19:10.858
Monster!

19:12.192 --> 19:15.195
Not, no, boys.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.195
It's, it's just me, Joey. See?

19:16.823 --> 19:20.284
What happened? You forget to set

19:16.823 --> 19:20.284
the calendar again this year?

19:20.326 --> 19:23.121
Well, you see, Danny, I knew the

19:20.326 --> 19:23.121
boys were afraid of Santa Claus.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.123
So, I dug up my

19:23.162 --> 19:25.123
old Easter Bunny costume

19:25.164 --> 19:26.666
'cause everybody loves

19:25.164 --> 19:26.666
the Easter Bunny

19:26.707 --> 19:29.376
so, everybody's gonna love..

19:29.418 --> 19:30.753
...the Christmas bunny.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.924
There are still

19:32.171 --> 19:34.924
a couple of hold-outs.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.593
But at least you're able to

19:34.966 --> 19:37.593
stuff a pillow under this suit.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.261
I'm not using a pillow.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.557
Oh, sorry.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.392
- We want Santa!

19:45.434 --> 19:47.520
- We want Santa!

19:47.561 --> 19:49.814
- We want Santa!

19:49.856 --> 19:52.066
- Hey, everybody. We're back.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.066
- Hi.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.484
And we brought

19:52.108 --> 19:53.484
a surprise.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.071
Ho ho ho!

20:01.993 --> 20:04.244
Go see Santa.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.872
This is one

20:04.286 --> 20:05.872
of Santa's helpers.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.874
You-You guys know Mr. Dreghorn

20:05.913 --> 20:07.874
from the novelty store.

20:07.915 --> 20:08.916
- Yeah.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.584
Merry Christmas,

20:08.958 --> 20:10.584
everybody!

20:10.626 --> 20:12.712
- Merry Christmas.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.712
- Merry Christmas!

20:12.753 --> 20:14.213
Merry Christmas, Santa.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.256
Merry Christmas, bugs.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.093
Alright,

20:17.550 --> 20:19.093
gather around, everybody.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.469
I've got presents

20:19.135 --> 20:20.469
for everybody.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.722
- Oh, wow.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.722
- Santa has presents.

20:22.763 --> 20:23.848
What's in the bag, guys?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.307
Hey, where were you guys?

20:25.349 --> 20:26.684
I bought you a dumb present.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.061
And I had to return it

20:28.102 --> 20:30.479
so you'd have something nice

20:28.102 --> 20:30.479
for Christmas.

20:30.521 --> 20:33.440
Michelle, you didn't have

20:30.521 --> 20:33.440
to do that.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.942
I'd love anything

20:33.482 --> 20:34.942
you got me.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.653
I wanted to get you

20:34.984 --> 20:37.653
the<i> best</i> present I could.
