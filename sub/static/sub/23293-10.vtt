WEBVTT

00:26.280 --> 00:28.840
There’s no butler to wash your hands here.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.880
You’re the only who’s been released,
and we’re staying here.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.960
-Hey.
-She’s getting cocky.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.720
SUNDAY
4:40 PM

00:36.880 --> 00:38.800
Who do you think you are?
Daddy isn’t here.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.440
-Look at us in the eyes.
-Look at us in the eyes.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.600
54 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

00:44.760 --> 00:47.080
I’m sure that tit stuff
granted you a lot of fans.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.480
-Eh.
-Don’t move, eh.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.000
-Don’t look at me daringly.
-We’re here because of you.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.800
Isn’t enough for you
to screw eight people?

00:53.880 --> 00:56.040
-You don’t stand a chance here.
-Enjoy this.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.080
-Don’t touch me!
-Relax, will you?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.920
-Cut it out!
-Hey!

01:06.040 --> 01:09.600
That’s what you learn in private schools,
all against one?

01:10.680 --> 01:15.360
How brave of you, isn’t it? All of you
as a pack attacking the poor girl.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.080
You are the bravest one,
aren’t you, athletic boy?

01:21.800 --> 01:24.320
The one who has the biggest balls, true?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.640
Let’s make sure.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.240
They are like quail eggs, like quail eggs.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.400
How does a quail sound?
Let’s see, how does a quail sound?

01:38.120 --> 01:39.680
I don’t know much about birds.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.320
Then, how does a hen sound?

01:43.240 --> 01:44.160
Louder.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.240
Louder.

01:51.760 --> 01:52.640
Very good.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.760
Helsinki, take this brats away
and this one, first.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.440
Come on, the blonde one, move along.
Come on, you too. Move.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.280
Wait, wait, wait.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.840
Are you okay?

02:09.080 --> 02:10.360
Could you give me another one?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.960
No, darling, this is not an outlet shop.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.320
Take it off and start rubbing.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.120
I might as well take the opportunity, too.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.960
It’s been over 50 hours,
going upstairs, downstairs,

02:23.040 --> 02:24.440
printing money...

02:25.840 --> 02:28.160
And I’m starting to need a shower.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.560
Do you know what your problem is?

02:31.000 --> 02:35.360
Your problem is that you don’t know
how much potential you have, do you?

02:36.320 --> 02:39.680
You must have done it really bad
to be the loser in your class.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.760
But you can still be the ball queen.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.800
It’s not that difficult,
it’s like in those American movies

02:46.880 --> 02:49.400
where the loser takes off her glasses

02:49.480 --> 02:52.520
and all of the sudden...
bum, she is a bombshell.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.280
No, I don’t wear glasses.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.120
Yes, darling,
I know you don’t wear glasses.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.760
But there must be something
you can do, isn’t there?

03:00.680 --> 03:01.680
Dancing.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.560
Well, brilliant. And what kind of dance,
what can you dance?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.120
Classical and contemporary ballet.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.760
I see.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.840
Something else.
Some other stuff you can do.

03:14.680 --> 03:15.560
Hunting.

03:16.840 --> 03:17.720
Hunting?

03:18.800 --> 03:19.680
With guns?

03:22.560 --> 03:25.040
Fine, wow. Gosh, and you look so innocent.

03:25.320 --> 03:29.200
That’s more frightening,
because what you have to do

03:29.840 --> 03:32.200
is to make those suckers
see what you are capable of.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.840
Show them you’re not scared.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.680
Look.

03:40.040 --> 03:44.840
You have to patiently wait
for the right moment.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.120
Then you pretend you have it
in your sights...

03:51.280 --> 03:52.800
and do something that says:

03:54.920 --> 03:59.040
"My name is Alison Parker
and I’m the fucking boss."

04:02.040 --> 04:06.240
You say it, repeat it. Look at yourself
and repeat, say it, say it.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.960
Say it, go ahead.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.840
My name is Alison Parker
and I’m the fucking boss.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.760
No, but properly, mean it.
Believe it, look into your eyes.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.960
Look at yourself, the super female
you are. Repeat it.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.480
My name's Alison Parker
and I’m the fucking boss.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.520
Who are you?

04:24.600 --> 04:26.640
-The fucking boss.
-Who are you?

04:26.720 --> 04:28.600
-The fucking boss!
-Who are you?

04:28.680 --> 04:30.640
-The fucking boss!
-Who are you?

04:30.720 --> 04:31.680
The fucking boss!

05:43.840 --> 05:45.080
Has anything been sent in?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.880
Excuse, I need to make
a private phone call.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.560
Can you turn down the audio?
And don’t record it, won’t you?

06:33.880 --> 06:36.320
-Hello?
-Hello, Salva, it’s Raquel.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.080
Hello.

06:40.880 --> 06:41.920
Sorry, is...

06:43.080 --> 06:45.240
Is it a weird moment?

06:45.440 --> 06:49.640
No, no, absurd, in fact,
I was doing some...

06:49.720 --> 06:51.400
work-out on the mobile bench.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.840
-Mobile bench?
-"Well, yes, it’s"

06:54.000 --> 06:56.880
a machine I use to... well, to work out.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.040
Well, I’ll make it quick,
I just wanted to ask you

07:00.120 --> 07:04.160
if you’ve chosen the place
where to have dinner this evening.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.800
Honestly I haven’t yet. You see,

07:07.960 --> 07:11.280
each time I read an online review
of a restaurant

07:11.360 --> 07:14.640
I’m feeling more like meeting up
at the usual place, at the Hanoi.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.320
It sounds great.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.120
"And we’ll leave experiments
for some another day."

07:20.600 --> 07:22.960
Say at 09:00 PM, is it okay for you?

07:23.160 --> 07:25.440
Say 09:00 PM, it sound very good.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.360
Good.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.400
Raquel.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.200
"I have some more relevant information
on Retroxil."

07:39.040 --> 07:42.040
Listen up everyone,
I need you to leave the tent

07:42.200 --> 07:44.400
"again, it’ll take only five minutes."

07:49.440 --> 07:51.880
Don’t you think
you’re being a tiny bit paranoid?

07:52.800 --> 07:54.920
Do I have to remind you
that there’s a mole?

07:55.240 --> 07:59.040
It doesn’t have to be a police officer.
A lot of people come in and out of here.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.520
"I don’t know, the paramedics,
the Metropolitan police...."

08:02.680 --> 08:05.000
Even that friend of yours
from the café was in here.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.480
Fine. What have you got?

08:13.040 --> 08:15.240
As I told you, Retroxil is a medicine

08:15.320 --> 08:17.760
used to treat Parkinson disease,
some experiments are being carried out

08:17.840 --> 08:21.000
for some muscles dystrophies,
such as Helmers’ Myopathy.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.640
It’s administered intravenously.

08:24.160 --> 08:25.600
As it’s made to order,

08:25.760 --> 08:27.640
they know exactly where all patients live.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.360
And I guess all the pharmacies
will always place the same order

08:30.440 --> 08:31.760
for the same sick people,

08:31.920 --> 08:32.800
-"won’t they?
-Correct.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.200
But there has been
an unusual demand in Toledo."

08:35.360 --> 08:38.040
These last five months, have a look,
the distributor dispatched

08:38.120 --> 08:40.800
enough medicine to treat 40 sick people.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.840
And there aren’t 40 sick people in Toledo.

08:43.920 --> 08:46.200
-No, there are three
in the whole of Castilla-La Mancha.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.680
Where are those pharmacies?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.120
All of them are in...

08:55.880 --> 08:58.360
around Illescas, about 35 kilometres away.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.920
"Where was the last purchase?"

09:03.760 --> 09:06.080
Look, here, in Palomeque, on 18th October.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.440
Just three days before
they went inside the Fábrica.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.400
Yes. Ten packages of the medicine
were purchased.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.440
Get and authorization from judge Andrade

09:18.600 --> 09:20.240
"and go to that pharmacy, alone.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.720
I want you to get hold of all the lists"

09:22.880 --> 09:25.440
of purchases. And, I don’t know,
see if you can find something.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.280
-Please, don’t talk to anyone about this.
-Sure, I won’t.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.440
By the way, Raquel.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.400
Listen.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.520
I don’t you want to think that,
because of what I said to you yesterday,

09:45.560 --> 09:47.280
Mari Carmen and I are not good.

09:48.640 --> 09:53.280
In fact, this very same morning...
well, we made love.

09:59.520 --> 10:00.400
"Yes."

10:01.960 --> 10:04.600
-How wonderful, isn’t it?
-Yes, yes, yes.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.400
You can all come in now.

10:22.840 --> 10:26.320
Arturito, I have a nice surprise for you.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.880
You see, I want you to know that I...

10:33.640 --> 10:35.080
I respect any option.

10:35.880 --> 10:39.640
I even have a brother who is homosexual,
he lives in Sitges and...

10:40.600 --> 10:43.560
Well, he still hasn’t talked
about it openly

10:43.640 --> 10:45.960
but the whole family thinks he is.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.240
He does Pilates and...

10:51.280 --> 10:53.800
Actually, it’s a door
I would rather not open.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.120
To be honest.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.200
What door you speak? Not understand.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.480
This is nice surprise
I’m telling you about.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.560
About door we speak another day.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.560
Helsinki, leave them on their own,
they’ll need to talk.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.960
I thought they had killed you.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.360
I swear I knew, I would see you again.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.160
And, that’s what gave me the strength

12:06.080 --> 12:09.240
even at those moments
I was fighting for my life

12:09.320 --> 12:10.960
you were there, you never went away.

12:16.680 --> 12:17.960
I love your neck.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.120
Your hair drives me crazy.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.200
This has never happened to me.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.560
I promise you that I’ll get you
out of here, my love.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.600
They’re coming in, aren’t they?

13:18.600 --> 13:19.880
Play the one of the girl.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.800
"My name is Ariadna Cascales and I’m fine,

13:23.520 --> 13:24.880
physically and mentally.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.640
We have been treated well
by the kidnappers

13:27.720 --> 13:29.280
and I have nothing to object to."

13:29.360 --> 13:31.400
It’s today’s news report
next to the hostage.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.520
-"A kiss for my family."
-What’s the problem then?

13:34.680 --> 13:36.560
The IC people have analysed
the video recording.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.640
It seems they have used
an editing programme.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.840
Are you telling me
that in 40 minutes they had enough time

13:42.920 --> 13:44.560
to use special effects?

13:44.800 --> 13:46.120
We think they have overlaid

13:46.200 --> 13:48.320
the footage of the news report
onto an old footage.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.320
The quality of the recording
is not good enough

13:50.400 --> 13:52.320
to accept it as a true proof of life.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.160
They have lowered the quality to 240
and it’s been done on purpose.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.200
It’s a bad symptom.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.440
The shooting in the Fábrica
is hitting the headlines

14:00.520 --> 14:04.920
from every TV news report in this country.
The press demands at least a press note.

14:05.360 --> 14:08.680
And the President’s Office
wants us to go in.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.400
-I need more time.
-And I need a facelift,

14:12.480 --> 14:14.560
but they want us to go in now.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.040
Give me a couple of hours.

14:18.680 --> 14:22.000
If in two hours I haven’t obtained
those proofs of life, then we’ll go in.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.040
Agreed.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.920
"Manipulating those proofs
wasn’t an intelligent move.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.600
I would rather say it was..."

14:33.760 --> 14:36.080
-stupid.
-"Please, Inspector,"

14:36.240 --> 14:37.840
we can’t minimize our relationship

14:37.920 --> 14:40.560
to these blunt messages
and to insults without a...

14:40.720 --> 14:42.520
'How are you, how was your day?'

14:42.600 --> 14:45.280
You go straight to the point,
don’t tell me you’re like that."

14:45.360 --> 14:48.400
Look here, quite frankly
I have no time for nonsense.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.680
"Well, 15 seconds more,
will not change our lives.

14:51.960 --> 14:52.840
Tell me."

14:53.280 --> 14:55.000
Let’s say you meet someone

14:55.960 --> 14:58.960
and you sleep with him,

14:59.120 --> 15:03.000
"are you one of those who gets up
in the middle of the night and..."

15:03.160 --> 15:06.880
leaves not even remembering his name?
Do those things fulfil you?

15:07.160 --> 15:09.720
As a matter of fact I would love to do it.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.800
"Yes, but I’ve been programmed to do"

15:12.960 --> 15:18.400
other things first, such us, I don’t know,
chat, laugh, talk about my life,

15:18.480 --> 15:21.600
have a coffee, go for a walk,
go to the cinema, go dancing...

15:21.760 --> 15:23.480
"Without that order of things...

15:23.880 --> 15:26.120
honestly, I don’t see myself
sleeping with someone."

15:26.280 --> 15:28.400
-Call me old fashioned, if you want.
-"No."

15:28.560 --> 15:29.440
No, no.

15:29.880 --> 15:34.280
In fact I share the same priorities,
but I would add one:

15:36.480 --> 15:37.720
going to a karaoke.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.640
"Call me weird, but..."

15:39.800 --> 15:44.000
I can’t help it, I like it, I love it.
But, I don’t want to waste your time.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.440
-Tell me.
-"It’s very simple."

15:46.600 --> 15:50.360
Those proofs of life are of no value,
so we have no option but to go in.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.520
"And we can either do it
to watch peacefully

15:53.840 --> 15:55.320
or to free those people"

15:55.400 --> 15:56.680
with gas and the whole artillery.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.080
"Hold on a second,
let’s see if I have fully understood."

16:00.000 --> 16:02.920
-You’re asking me to let you come in.
-"You choose:"

16:03.480 --> 16:04.760
either I send in the tanks

16:05.840 --> 16:07.360
or you and I have a coffee

16:07.440 --> 16:09.640
and you show me
that all the hostages are alive.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.160
I would be delighted to invite you in.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.160
I don’t know if we’ll get to the karaoke
thing, but I can’t refuse.

16:26.120 --> 16:30.200
-Raquel, I won’t let you go in there.
-I give the orders here, not you.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.040
-Fine.
-Ángel.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.240
Excuse.

16:37.280 --> 16:41.120
Right now, there’s more work
out there than in here.

16:42.120 --> 16:45.240
Also, you’re the only person I can trust.

16:48.320 --> 16:51.440
Well, gentlemen, ladies.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.320
We’re going in.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.120
Lift your arms.

17:20.720 --> 17:21.720
Go ahead.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.120
Your legs.

17:32.640 --> 17:33.880
Where is the Professor?

17:37.960 --> 17:41.000
He asked me to excuse him,
but, due to discretion reasons,

17:41.080 --> 17:42.080
he can’t be present.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.360
Bear in mind that his face
is not hitting the headlines,

17:45.440 --> 17:46.320
as ours are.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.280
She has no guns.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.800
Rio, it’s your turn, do the honours.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.640
You’ll excuse us, but...

18:00.080 --> 18:01.600
"we have to be conscientious."

18:16.000 --> 18:17.080
Raquel.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.880
It’s said that the Police are not dumb,
but sometimes they look like it.

18:22.040 --> 18:22.920
Did you really think

18:23.000 --> 18:25.800
-you would sneak in a micro?
-And did you think that my people

18:25.880 --> 18:27.440
wouldn’t make sure I was safe?

18:28.640 --> 18:30.600
Tokyo, frisk the Inspector again,

18:30.680 --> 18:33.720
but this time, do it with a little more
enthusiasm, as you know how.

19:09.840 --> 19:13.440
You’ve left me gob smacked,
the cops using cutting-edge technology,

19:13.520 --> 19:15.320
a perianal microphone.

19:17.640 --> 19:18.760
Get rid of this.

19:20.000 --> 19:20.960
Have you finished?

19:22.440 --> 19:24.120
Come with me, if you’d be so kind.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.960
"At that moment Rio freezes.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.920
Thunderbolt, as his mum
used to call him as a child,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.440
when he spent
the summer afternoons running.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.960
She used to say he’d be
an Olympic champion,

19:40.560 --> 19:42.480
but he swapped sports for video consoles

19:43.080 --> 19:46.200
and plans in the open air
for risking ending up in prison."

19:48.280 --> 19:49.160
Judge Andrade,

19:49.680 --> 19:50.920
it’s Detective Rubio here,

19:51.000 --> 19:54.160
from the robbery with hostages in
the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.400
I’m calling you because we need

19:56.480 --> 19:59.760
a search and seize warrant
of a pharmacy in Toledo.

20:01.680 --> 20:02.560
Yes.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.080
Yes, we’re following a lead
on one of the robbers.

20:11.040 --> 20:11.920
Okay.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.160
Okay. We have the feeling

20:19.240 --> 20:22.720
that someone is passing them
information from outside

20:22.800 --> 20:25.080
and I would ask you
for your absolute discretion, please.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.520
Okay. Okay, alright, much appreciated.

20:31.080 --> 20:31.960
Good bye, bye.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.320
Raquel is not here.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.880
No, in fact, I just came
to have something to drink.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.720
"This way, the siege laid by the police

20:48.800 --> 20:51.280
onto the gang of robbers who last Friday,

20:51.360 --> 20:53.120
-broke into the Fábrica Nacional..."
-Excuse me,

20:53.200 --> 20:54.920
how’s that matter of the hold-up going?
Because...

20:55.280 --> 20:58.480
I heard that there was some shooting
and it seems that it will go on

20:58.560 --> 20:59.600
for a little longer.

21:00.120 --> 21:03.400
-No, no, it’s about to end.
-Ah, really?

21:03.480 --> 21:05.320
-Yes.
-Then I’m glad it is,

21:05.400 --> 21:07.040
I’m very happy because...

21:07.520 --> 21:09.880
My goodness, I can imagine
how awful it must be

21:09.960 --> 21:12.080
for those poor people,
the hostages, I mean.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.920
Let alone, for you.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.280
-Do you work close to here?
-Yes, just round the corner.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.640
As Raquel told me you were unemployed....

21:31.280 --> 21:35.600
The thing is two months ago, I lost my job
and now I’m trying to run

21:35.680 --> 21:36.960
-my own business.
-I see.

21:37.160 --> 21:40.200
-Well, a small business, it’s...
-An entrepreneur.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.160
Yes.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.440
And what kind of business?

21:45.600 --> 21:46.840
Cider.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.000
-No way.
-Organic cider.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.600
-My mother was from Oviedo.
-Really?

21:52.680 --> 21:54.120
Yes, yes, yes.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.840
I make it myself
in a workshop I have over there.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.600
I, instead of nursing my mother’s
breast milk, I nursed cider.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.120
Yes, my grandfather
owned a field of apple trees,

22:05.200 --> 22:08.080
a small field.
And, so, I started working on it.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.840
-And the workshop is near here?
-Yes, very near.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.600
-I would love to taste it.
-Sure, done.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.040
-One day I’ll bring you a bottle.
-Thank you.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.400
The Professor told me
that he has ordered a coffee.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.240
It’s decaf.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.280
We don’t want you lose any sleep.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.600
Let’s start with the proofs of life.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.120
Go ahead!

22:47.080 --> 22:48.920
For appetizers, we have here Arturo Roman,

22:49.000 --> 22:50.800
CEO of the Fábrica de Moneda y Timbre.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.960
Is it your intention to make me see
all the hostages one by one?

22:54.560 --> 22:57.800
Correct, so you don’t lose track of them.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.320
Arturo...

23:08.600 --> 23:10.600
This lady is Raquel Murillo,

23:11.440 --> 23:13.480
the Inspector who ordered you to be shot.

23:14.040 --> 23:17.040
But don’t be frightened,
she has been thoroughly frisked

23:17.120 --> 23:20.440
and she’s disarmed.
Please, treat him delicately.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.280
Arturo is actually a very sensitive man

23:24.080 --> 23:26.160
and he’s been a little traumatized.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.520
How are you, Arturo?

23:29.440 --> 23:30.760
I’d seen better days.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.280
I wanted to say sorry...

23:34.280 --> 23:37.880
on behalf of the Police
and my own, of course.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.920
It was a terrible mistake
and I hope you get better soon.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.360
Right.

23:49.240 --> 23:52.000
-The next one can come in.
-No, don’t be impatient, please.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.880
After we’ve had the courtesy
to let you talk with all of them.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.880
I’m sorry, but I can’t be here
the whole day.

23:59.240 --> 24:02.600
It’s a pity, I was starting
to have get my expectations high.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.440
I’ve got a pair of scissors.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.640
Sorry?

24:16.960 --> 24:19.760
I took them out of fear,
but having them puts me in danger.

24:19.840 --> 24:20.920
What are you talking about?

24:21.640 --> 24:24.600
What are you doing?
Hide them, you’ll get us in real trouble.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.600
I don’t want them.

24:25.680 --> 24:27.360
-I’ll drop them right here.
-Put them away.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.400
-I don’t want them.
-Please.

24:29.520 --> 24:32.120
-Give them to me, give them to me.
-Arturito.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.520
Move along with me.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.480
What were those shots?

24:54.840 --> 24:55.760
Please.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.640
They’ll kill us all.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.720
One after the other.

25:15.240 --> 25:18.400
"One after the other,
that’s how all the hostages would talk

25:18.480 --> 25:19.840
to the Inspector."

25:20.000 --> 25:22.120
Would you say
the way you’d been treated is good?

25:22.200 --> 25:23.400
I can’t complain.

25:23.560 --> 25:26.720
"The way children queue up to talk
with Santa at a shopping centre."

25:26.880 --> 25:29.960
-Have you been able to sleep?
-I’ve been able to rest.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.000
She reminds me of my aunt.

25:41.840 --> 25:42.880
Although my aunt’s dead.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.560
Did you finish your coffee?

26:03.360 --> 26:06.760
This next one I quite like,
he’s extremely quiet.

26:20.920 --> 26:25.000
Don’t you dare say anything
about the gunshot, right?

26:28.360 --> 26:30.120
-Mónica?
-Yes.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.480
Are you all right?

26:33.720 --> 26:35.040
Well, I’m a bit dizzy.

26:38.080 --> 26:39.360
Because I’m pregnant.

26:41.560 --> 26:46.040
Sorry for asking, but was it you
who asked for an abortion pill?

26:46.200 --> 26:47.080
Yes.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.440
It was me, yes,
but I have changed my mind.

26:54.800 --> 26:57.400
I don’t know whether I’ll get out of here.

26:58.840 --> 27:02.240
If I do, I don’t know if I would be fit
to look after this baby,

27:02.640 --> 27:04.760
but I’d like to continue
with the pregnancy.

27:09.720 --> 27:10.600
You will.

27:14.560 --> 27:19.480
No matter how tough things get,
children always turn out OK.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.640
The problem comes
when they grow up.

27:31.520 --> 27:34.600
If I know about something, Inspector,
it’s about women and children,

27:35.200 --> 27:38.360
so the mum to be should not worry,
she’ll be well looked after.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.200
Next one, please.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.920
Mónica, are you all right?

28:04.400 --> 28:06.320
Were you also taken
to talk with the Inspector?

28:06.400 --> 28:08.720
-What did she say?
-If I was fine,

28:08.800 --> 28:10.920
if I was getting enough rest.
And they asked me

28:11.000 --> 28:13.760
-not to say anything about the wound.
-They want a proof of life.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.720
-Luckily, we’re all well.
-No, not luckily, no,

28:16.800 --> 28:19.080
quite the opposite,
if the proof of life failed,

28:19.160 --> 28:21.280
they’ll realize
that something isn’t going well.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.640
They won’t have any other choice
but to come in.

28:30.480 --> 28:31.680
Listen to me, Alison.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.120
Only you can get us out,
you have to disappear

28:35.200 --> 28:36.880
while the proof of live is taken place.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.360
-There’s a hidden safety box.
-No.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.000
You only have to get into it
and lock it from inside.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.600
-There’s a sequence of numbers.
-But I can’t do that.

28:44.760 --> 28:48.120
You are their safe conduct, if you don’t
show up at the proof of life,

28:48.280 --> 28:51.160
they’ll have no choice
but to come in for you.

28:51.640 --> 28:53.520
You have to do it, it’s very easy.

28:53.760 --> 28:59.520
-29175232, can you do it?
-29137...

28:59.600 --> 29:02.040
-29175.
-2917...

29:02.280 --> 29:04.760
-5.
-29175372.

29:04.840 --> 29:08.120
-29175232.
-29137...

29:08.200 --> 29:10.280
-29175...
-Arturo, leave her alone.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.560
Leave her, can’t you see
we don’t stand a chance?

29:13.640 --> 29:16.240
-I’ve been shot, you...
-Everything will be fine, take my word.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.240
I’ve got hold of a pair of scissors.
Listen up.

29:20.920 --> 29:21.800
If they attack you,

29:21.880 --> 29:23.800
-use them to attack back.
-What are you saying?

29:23.880 --> 29:25.760
-Take them with you.
-I don’t want them.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.640
I’ve been told your wound opened up.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.840
I tried not to limp
so they wouldn’t notice

29:38.000 --> 29:39.480
and one of the stitches came out.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.280
Are you okay if I have a look?

29:43.040 --> 29:43.920
Okay.

29:48.440 --> 29:49.840
Does she have to get undressed?

29:49.920 --> 29:52.240
How do you expect him to cure me
if I don’t?

30:01.440 --> 30:03.040
Can you see those doubloons there?

30:04.720 --> 30:07.160
They were found
inside a Spanish sailor’s stomach.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
Mummified.

30:10.720 --> 30:13.400
Apparently, the captain found out
that he was stealing

30:13.480 --> 30:15.840
part of the cargo
they were carrying from the Indies.

30:16.800 --> 30:20.000
He made him swallow all the coins
he had skimmed, one by one,

30:20.080 --> 30:21.240
until he drowned.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.360
Can you imagine us
applying the same punishment?

30:26.480 --> 30:29.640
We would end up like a six-door
built-in wardrobe, wouldn’t we?

30:35.880 --> 30:37.720
You’re very funny, Inspector.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.880
I didn’t come here to tell jokes,
Fonollosa.

30:40.240 --> 30:41.920
I still need to see four police officers,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.640
eleven members of security
and three adolescents,

30:44.720 --> 30:46.040
one of them, Alison Parker.

30:46.120 --> 30:49.080
Please, you have to release the pressure,
do not be impatient.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.360
Dessert is always kept for the end.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.800
Right, but the dessert is taking very long

30:55.880 --> 30:58.160
and I’m worried
I’ll get indigestion.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.080
I want to see Parker now.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.360
She’s getting ready.

31:03.480 --> 31:06.480
You know what adolescents are like,
they always like to look at their best.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.400
I think deep down
it’s due to that insecurity

31:09.480 --> 31:12.000
that certain women have
throughout their whole lives.

31:16.920 --> 31:18.040
What’s wrong with the dogs?

31:18.120 --> 31:19.840
Helsinki is taking them out of their cage.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.040
Stand up.

31:24.840 --> 31:29.240
Cheer up, your boss has come to see you.
Come on, stand up.

31:29.760 --> 31:33.000
"In that silence,
Inspector Murillo could hear

31:33.080 --> 31:35.760
the machines working at full capacity
making banknotes

31:35.920 --> 31:38.160
and she realized we had deceived her,

31:38.480 --> 31:40.560
that the shooting had been a sham

31:40.640 --> 31:42.880
and that going in to the museum
had only contributed

31:42.960 --> 31:46.600
to give us two more hours
during which she had been off-guard.

31:46.760 --> 31:50.280
And we had made 16 more million euros.

31:51.160 --> 31:56.520
The Professor was right,
in this heist, time was precious."

31:56.680 --> 32:00.200
In our first lesson I told you
that, somehow,

32:00.280 --> 32:01.840
it won’t be stealing.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.040
We won’t be stealing anything
that belongs to other people, will we?

32:06.560 --> 32:07.440
Right.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.000
I lied to you.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.680
Because there is something
that we’ll be stealing,

32:16.320 --> 32:19.080
we’ll be stealing the Police’s time.

32:20.280 --> 32:21.760
We’ll put some cheese in the trap,

32:22.480 --> 32:25.040
they’ll take the bait
and we’ll lead them to a dead end.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.480
And they won’t be able to focus
on their main goal,

32:28.560 --> 32:32.800
which is to get us all out of there.
And when we have their time

32:33.320 --> 32:34.480
and their attention,

32:35.800 --> 32:37.280
we only have to prolong it.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.240
Stretch it, like if it was chewing-gum,

32:42.120 --> 32:44.360
meanwhile the machines
are working relentlessly.

32:46.920 --> 32:47.960
They’re no fools,

32:49.360 --> 32:52.360
at some point they’ll realize
that all this is a game,

32:52.440 --> 32:55.080
that it’s nothing but a manoeuvre
to distract their attention

32:55.160 --> 32:57.040
to keep printing money.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.880
Even then, they won’t be able
to do anything,

33:03.120 --> 33:07.360
because it’s their duty to solve a robbery
with hostages avoiding any casualties.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.480
"It looked easy.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.320
Perhaps with another inspector in charge,

33:15.400 --> 33:17.760
but Raquel was a woman in a men’s world,

33:18.440 --> 33:20.720
a single parent in the middle of divorce,

33:21.640 --> 33:24.280
a woman who had coped
with her husband’s abuse.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.040
And there, in front of Berlin,
she felt comfortable,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.560
like a teacher
in front of her rebellious pupils.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.720
And she wasn’t going to stand idly
while he was playing her for a fool."

33:41.080 --> 33:44.760
I’ve applied skin closure strips,
so you don’t need to be stitched up again.

33:44.840 --> 33:45.800
Better.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.480
And this, are you a surgeon now?

33:49.200 --> 33:52.600
Did you at least wash your hands,
didn't you?

33:53.280 --> 33:57.480
Of course I did, Arturito, to punch you
smelling of "Eau of fuck yourself."

33:57.920 --> 34:00.720
I’m getting dizzy,
if I could go back to where I was before,

34:00.800 --> 34:02.280
-to have a rest and...
-Yes.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.240
Listen up, Alison, this is not negotiable.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.480
I need you to do it,
I need you to do it for all of us.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.840
Do you want everyone
to beat the shit out of you,

34:29.920 --> 34:31.480
-your class-mates?
-What do you know?

34:32.120 --> 34:34.600
What do I know?
I’ve seen how they laugh at you,

34:34.920 --> 34:37.240
how they whisper behind your back,
I’ve seen them.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.800
I’ve seen how they treat you,
as a fucking loser.

34:41.320 --> 34:45.760
And you can change it all,
today, now, it’s in your hands.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.080
You have the possibility
to change your fate,

34:50.400 --> 34:52.560
but you have to stick to my plan, okay?

34:59.120 --> 35:01.440
Can you say that you are
in generally good health, then?

35:03.120 --> 35:05.280
Yes, you could say that.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.880
Helsinki, please,
take him to his chambers.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.960
Very well, I’ve seen all the hostages
except Alison Parker.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.600
I believe it’s her turn now, isn’t it?

35:26.720 --> 35:27.800
What will happen otherwise?

35:29.680 --> 35:30.680
Will you handcuff us?

35:32.360 --> 35:35.160
Hey, please, ladies, quiet down.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.400
It’s a bit early
to take the mud and the bikinis out.

35:39.560 --> 35:43.960
Look, since I have been in here,
I’ve only heard you say stupid things.

35:45.960 --> 35:48.600
I expected something more profound
from a man who has only...

35:48.680 --> 35:50.800
How much, seven months to live?

35:52.240 --> 35:53.360
What is she talking about?

35:55.560 --> 35:58.520
-What the fuck is going on?
-He suffers from Helmers’ Myopathy.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.240
A very aggressive degenerative disease,

36:02.320 --> 36:06.560
with a life expectancy of 14 to 25 months.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.800
His muscles may have
already started to weaken,

36:11.880 --> 36:15.640
what translates into spasms,
trembling of his hands....

36:18.560 --> 36:21.960
Haven’t you noticed that it's becoming
more and more difficult to hold your gun?

36:38.720 --> 36:40.040
I’ve put my foot in it.

36:41.520 --> 36:45.760
I though there were no secrets
amongst you, that you were friends.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.440
I want to see Alison Parker. Now.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.560
Can I go to the toilet for a moment?
Please, it’s quite urgent.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.200
Quickly.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.720
"Condor three, any movement?

37:08.440 --> 37:10.760
-Main entrance clear.
-Okay."

37:20.640 --> 37:21.520
Mr Berlin.

37:23.400 --> 37:24.640
Can I speak to you?

37:45.840 --> 37:47.960
I wanted to tell you
that I’m feeling much better.

37:48.040 --> 37:50.800
I’m less nervous and would like to go
downstairs with the other hostages.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.800
Are you not well here, any complaint?

37:54.120 --> 37:56.600
No, I’m well, I’m very well.

37:56.680 --> 38:00.960
That’s... why that I think
I could help with some tasks

38:01.040 --> 38:03.240
-you are assigning to people.
-Tell me, Ariadna,

38:03.320 --> 38:05.760
-what could help with?
-Anything, whatever.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.720
Cooking, breaking the ground...

38:08.880 --> 38:11.040
I believe you’re building a tunnel or....

38:13.040 --> 38:14.320
Can you come a bit closer?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.480
Break stone with those hands
would be a crime.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.680
Besides, we already have people
for that task.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.440
We also have people to print,

38:26.800 --> 38:30.360
to move the coils... As a matter of fact
we have people for everything.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.480
Last night you took Silvia away
and we heard gunshots.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.800
I can’t stand it any longer,
please, I need to get out.

38:41.680 --> 38:42.760
Everyone.

38:44.680 --> 38:47.160
Anguish, stress, anxiety....

38:49.480 --> 38:53.800
Me, for instance,
right now, I know for sure

38:53.880 --> 38:55.800
that I won’t be getting out of here alive.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.720
I, at your age, also thought
I could conquer the world,

39:02.080 --> 39:04.400
that I wasn’t going to look back
in my bloody life

39:04.480 --> 39:06.840
and that... I’d never regret anything.

39:07.160 --> 39:10.200
But one day you come

39:10.680 --> 39:11.760
to a sudden stop.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.360
Yes. And it’d be better
that you come to a sudden stop

39:15.440 --> 39:19.000
because you have been fired from work
or that your flat has been foreclosed.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.240
And not that the SWAT are shooting.

39:21.640 --> 39:25.440
The problem is that in my case I came
to a sudden stop because of a gunshot.

39:26.560 --> 39:30.360
To be more precise one I saw
with my own eyes to my boyfriend’s heart.

39:32.040 --> 39:32.960
Go out there

39:34.240 --> 39:35.800
and tell everyone

39:37.080 --> 39:38.600
that I can’t feel anything.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.720
And that they can come in to get me,

39:44.000 --> 39:44.880
shooting.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.360
"Units in alert for intervention, sir."

39:48.520 --> 39:51.240
-Why the hell is she taking so long?
-"Awaiting instructions."

39:52.640 --> 39:55.480
When Mussolini was being defeated
in World War II

39:55.560 --> 39:58.680
and a huge black cloud
stopped him from being able to think,

39:59.600 --> 40:03.880
he realized that the only thing
that could boost his stamina was sex.

40:06.080 --> 40:09.520
He had a prostitute living
in a room next to his office.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.080
He would pop in from time to time

40:13.640 --> 40:15.480
so she would make him feel happy again.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.840
I can help you solve your problems.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.920
Do you think I could be
with a woman who would come to me

40:23.000 --> 40:24.400
against her own will,

40:25.480 --> 40:28.160
if I could feel her disdain, is that it?

40:30.160 --> 40:31.560
I truly want.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.000
Try me out.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.440
Try me out, Mr Berlin.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.840
I don’t even know
if I wish to be with you.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.080
Why should I take a liking to you?

40:44.600 --> 40:46.920
Why don’t you dance a little
so I can see you?

40:51.680 --> 40:52.560
Dance.

41:03.320 --> 41:06.480
"For Ariadna, to have sex
with the leading kidnapper

41:06.560 --> 41:08.640
was the most certain way to save her life.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.960
But what she didn’t know is
that she wasn’t in danger yet.

41:13.600 --> 41:17.760
That was as desperate as innocent Alison’s
attempt to escape,

41:19.040 --> 41:21.800
that had the fucking nerve
to try to run away from Nairobi.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.440
Perhaps that’s what desperation gives,
the nerve.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.760
And an absolute determination to hold on
to life like two vicious bitches."

42:06.000 --> 42:07.920
Holy shit! Alison!

42:08.280 --> 42:09.640
Alison!

42:14.880 --> 42:16.040
Alison!

43:10.400 --> 43:13.120
-Hello, Salva. How are you doing?
-Fine.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.160
You see, I was
in the neighbourhood, and...

43:15.240 --> 43:17.880
Anyway, I saw you coming in
and I said: "Is it Salva?"

43:17.960 --> 43:18.960
And yes, it’s you.

43:19.920 --> 43:21.400
Do you mind if I come in?

43:23.160 --> 43:24.480
-Now?
-Yes, please.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.640
Sure, come in. Come in.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.720
What a nice place you have here.

43:37.480 --> 43:38.680
Sorry for bothering you,

43:38.760 --> 43:41.760
but I’m looking forward to tasting
that cider that you promised me.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.240
Of course, mate, right away.

43:54.520 --> 43:55.960
Thank you. Cheers.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.440
I told you I was an amateur,
not a professional...

44:05.520 --> 44:09.080
No, not bad, not bad at all.
To be fair, a little bitter.

44:09.960 --> 44:11.000
One thing.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.520
How are things with Raquel?

44:17.840 --> 44:20.480
-You’re seen each other, aren’t you?
-Well, let’s see,

44:20.800 --> 44:22.920
seen each other, as such,
not really, we are...

44:23.000 --> 44:26.600
I mean... We’ve talked sometimes
and now we’re going on a date,

44:26.680 --> 44:27.920
-that’s true, but...
-Sure.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.400
And we have some affinities,
specially on my side.

44:30.480 --> 44:32.920
I regard Raquel as a woman
with a lot of charisma.

44:33.480 --> 44:34.960
In fact, we hardly know each other.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.600
If you’re going to give her this brew,
you’d better improve it.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.760
If you give her three glasses of that,
she’ll have a running stomach.

44:42.320 --> 44:45.080
It wouldn’t be an ideal date, would it?

44:45.240 --> 44:47.600
Sure, sure.
Thank you very much for the advice.

44:47.760 --> 44:50.080
It must be because you left there
the apples to dry.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.040
-Really?
-Yes.

44:51.520 --> 44:53.080
That spot is very damp, no?

45:11.480 --> 45:15.680
Silene, without that microphone
they don’t know whether I’m okay or not.

45:17.720 --> 45:19.720
SWAT units 2 and 3 in alert.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.160
-Nine minutes.
-In position.

45:23.720 --> 45:27.280
-Perhaps, you should have a heater?
-Well, they may rot.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.680
You should find other spot.

45:45.560 --> 45:46.440
Look.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.760
I have to leave to avoid a massacre
with or without proofs of life,

45:50.840 --> 45:51.800
do you understand?

45:56.200 --> 45:57.040
Sit down.

45:58.760 --> 45:59.920
Four minutes.

46:00.240 --> 46:02.680
Am I fucking making myself clear or not?
Sit down.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.400
Alison, Alison, Alison.

46:11.360 --> 46:14.720
There are 10,000 square meters here.
Who knows where the heck she is?

46:18.120 --> 46:19.000
Excuse me.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.240
Hello?

46:24.840 --> 46:26.960
I’m going to phone the Professor,
keep looking for her.

46:29.240 --> 46:32.000
Is it ready? Good.
Has the judge signed it?

46:33.600 --> 46:36.400
Okay, that’s perfect.
I’m on my way there. Thank you.

46:37.760 --> 46:39.880
You’ll have to excuse me,
it’s the call of duty.

46:40.480 --> 46:41.360
What a shame.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.200
-Don’t you want to take a bottle with you?
-No, thanks.

46:49.600 --> 46:52.200
I don’t bother with it, anyway,
who uses a land line telephone?

46:52.280 --> 46:53.160
Yes.

47:02.520 --> 47:05.400
Second floor, office 17,
inside the safety box.

47:18.520 --> 47:20.600
-Stupid kid.
-No!

47:30.960 --> 47:32.240
-Alison, are you okay?
-Yes, yes.

47:32.320 --> 47:34.680
We have no time,
if there’s anything, give it to me.

47:34.760 --> 47:38.200
Weren’t you in a hurry? Hurry up then.
Rio, with me.

47:58.840 --> 48:01.600
How are you, Pilar? Did you find anything?

48:02.240 --> 48:05.200
-Yes, there was a fingerprint.
-And?

48:07.520 --> 48:09.840
And there’s no match with any fingerprint
of the police officers

48:09.920 --> 48:12.080
-that drive it.
-What do you mean there’s no match?

48:12.240 --> 48:14.600
-Did you run it through the database?
-Yes, I did,

48:14.680 --> 48:17.440
no matches,
this fingerprint is not in any base

48:17.520 --> 48:19.120
-in Spain.
-I see.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.920
Do me a favour.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.080
Compare it against the fingerprints
on this coffee spoon, right?

48:25.160 --> 48:28.120
When you have the results, call me,
it doesn’t matter what time it is.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.240
-Done.
-Thank you.

48:29.320 --> 48:32.600
-Where does the coffee spoon come from?
-Alberto.

48:32.680 --> 48:35.120
Have you obtained the kidnapper’s cutlery?

48:35.200 --> 48:38.560
No, it comes from somewhere else,
a hunch to be discarded.

48:38.640 --> 48:40.120
You know that we can’t analyse anything

48:40.200 --> 48:42.520
that has no seal
and with no registration of the origin.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.760
I ask you this as a special favour for me.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.120
Damn, you keep your cards
close to your chest, Angelito.

48:49.200 --> 48:51.520
We know more about the robbery
from TV than from you.

48:54.960 --> 48:57.160
Don’t worry, when we have the results,

48:57.240 --> 48:59.320
-we’ll phone you, right?
-Thank you.

49:00.560 --> 49:01.720
How’s Raquel?

49:02.880 --> 49:04.120
Is she moving on?

49:05.280 --> 49:07.280
Yes, she’s moving on, slowly.

49:15.960 --> 49:19.600
Dear colleagues, after long consideration

49:21.280 --> 49:22.960
I wanted to say sorry for not...

49:24.120 --> 49:27.880
being completely honest with you.
The Inspector was right.

49:31.880 --> 49:33.520
I have a degenerative disease.

49:36.440 --> 49:37.760
Quite tough.

49:41.040 --> 49:43.760
And I’m living on borrowed time, but...

49:44.800 --> 49:46.800
it isn’t my intention to make you feel sad

49:48.320 --> 49:51.000
and let alone that you feel sorry for me.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.120
After all, it’s a disease

49:54.200 --> 49:57.480
that one in 100,000 people suffer.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.400
And that makes me a very special person.

50:02.080 --> 50:04.960
What I want is to ask
you to celebrate with me. Rio.

50:16.760 --> 50:18.120
We’ll all die.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.240
Cheers to that.

50:31.400 --> 50:32.600
Because we’re alive.

50:36.920 --> 50:39.360
And because the plan is going smoothly.

50:45.640 --> 50:46.560
To life.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.320
And to the plan.

51:12.520 --> 51:16.480
"Aníbal Cortés is
the weakest link in the chain.

51:17.480 --> 51:19.920
That micro wouldn’t be undetected
in any frisk.

51:20.680 --> 51:22.480
That’s why I said to the Science Unit

51:23.440 --> 51:25.240
to place a message inside."

51:25.400 --> 51:27.720
And how do we know
the boy has seen the video?

51:29.800 --> 51:32.640
"Hello, son.
We’ve hired a very good lawyer

51:32.800 --> 51:36.480
and he’s got you a collaboration deal
with the authorities. This."

51:36.840 --> 51:41.040
Aníbal Cortés turning himself in
would mean that our plan is working.

51:42.720 --> 51:45.920
"We have also spoken to the police
and say that if you turn yourself in

51:46.640 --> 51:49.400
and agree to collaborate
in the investigation,

51:49.560 --> 51:52.600
the judge will give a reduced sentence.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.120
You’ll be in prison less than a year.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.680
We’re doing everything we can from here

51:57.760 --> 52:00.320
so you can be well
when you get out of here,

52:00.400 --> 52:04.600
because you shouldn’t be there.
Think about it, please, Thunderbolt.

52:06.200 --> 52:09.680
Think it over, you can back out, darling.

52:10.440 --> 52:12.720
Thunderbolt, it’s not too late."

52:25.200 --> 52:27.680
-Tell me, What’s wrong?
-"Are you coming home for dinner?"

52:27.760 --> 52:31.360
No, I don’t think I’ll make it for dinner,
I have something to do in a pharmacy.

52:31.440 --> 52:34.280
-"I’ll wait for you, i don’t mind."
-No, darling, it's not in Madrid,

52:34.360 --> 52:36.120
it’s in Toledo, in a town, in Palomeque.

52:37.280 --> 52:38.360
I’ll phone you later.

52:43.280 --> 52:45.280
Help, please, we have just been robbed.

52:45.440 --> 52:46.840
It’s okay, I’m the police.

52:50.200 --> 52:53.280
He only wanted the lists
of purchases without prescriptions,

52:53.360 --> 52:57.840
the accounts, the inventory
and the purchases book, too.

53:01.040 --> 53:02.720
"And as it happens in chess,

53:02.960 --> 53:06.680
there are times that, in order to win,
you need to sacrifice one of your pieces.

53:08.240 --> 53:10.280
In this case, one of the most valuable,

53:10.920 --> 53:12.480
our horse of Troy.

53:20.920 --> 53:22.920
The Professor had placed Ángel
in a hairy situation

53:23.080 --> 53:24.400
when going to that pharmacy,

53:26.280 --> 53:29.480
a situation that would
send him down to hell."

53:30.280 --> 53:34.480
Raquel, listen up, there was a guy
that arrived at the pharmacy before me.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.440
No, I don’t know
how it could have happened,

53:37.760 --> 53:39.320
only you and I knew about it.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.080
"And that’s how it happened.

53:43.760 --> 53:46.960
With a heavy heart, when old good Angelito

53:47.040 --> 53:50.800
snooped around the hangar,
the Professor decided to sacrifice him."
