00:12.232 --> 00:13.758
What are you doing?

00:13.818 --> 00:15.385
Oh, Nick, you scared me.

00:15.563 --> 00:17.430
- I thought you'd gone home.
- Forgot my keys.

00:17.506 --> 00:19.572
What are you doing
in here so late, Ginny?

00:19.609 --> 00:21.609
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this is?

00:21.677 --> 00:22.877
I'm sorry. I'll leave.

00:22.945 --> 00:24.202
Immediately.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.741
I'm sorry.

00:38.989 --> 00:41.324
Whoa! Tasha, it's me!

00:42.184 --> 00:43.585
Sorry.

00:43.843 --> 00:46.229
- Guess I'm wound a little tight.
- You guess?

00:46.431 --> 00:49.099
Dominic just buried
Jane alive and got away.

00:49.369 --> 00:50.869
There's gotta be something here

00:50.906 --> 00:52.750
that points to where he might be.

00:53.585 --> 00:55.343
No one expects you
to find him on your own.

00:56.712 --> 00:58.012
Morning!

00:58.655 --> 00:59.804
Hey, Tasha.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.220
Here's the bagels you wanted.

01:01.257 --> 01:03.939
You weren't still here
working at 4 a.m.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.460
when you texted us about craving
bagels, were you?

01:06.733 --> 01:08.156
All right, a little breakfast

01:08.193 --> 01:09.993
with the whole team in the
conference room, that's...

01:10.029 --> 01:11.359
Hey, what happened to you?

01:11.427 --> 01:12.894
Nothing happened to me.

01:12.961 --> 01:14.502
Excuse me, did you mess with my system?

01:14.539 --> 01:15.963
What? No.

01:16.132 --> 01:18.181
Oh, I am trying to add a VR component

01:18.218 --> 01:19.870
to the Tattoo Squad board game.

01:20.261 --> 01:22.117
Hey, doesn't what's-her-face

01:22.154 --> 01:23.299
look a little peaked to you?

01:23.339 --> 01:25.440
I have been sifting

01:25.507 --> 01:28.525
through every file
we have on HCI Global,

01:28.562 --> 01:31.898
looking for any hint
of where Dominic might be.

01:32.567 --> 01:33.767
All right?

01:33.804 --> 01:35.817
Tasha... we all wanna catch him.

01:36.003 --> 01:38.101
But you gotta take care
of yourself, too.

01:38.172 --> 01:40.688
Look, why don't you go home
and get some rest.

01:40.843 --> 01:43.610
Right now, home is
a cheap motel in Newark.

01:43.792 --> 01:46.160
I gave up my apartment
when I went deep cover.

01:47.046 --> 01:49.897
I know you don't need a key
to get into my place,

01:49.965 --> 01:51.366
but take these.

01:51.433 --> 01:53.468
I'm not taking no for an answer, Tasha.

01:53.870 --> 01:55.071
Get some sleep.

01:59.670 --> 02:00.796
Thank you.

02:02.984 --> 02:04.369
Still no lead on the person

02:04.406 --> 02:06.960
that accessed the Sandstorm
bunker where we found all this.

02:06.997 --> 02:08.597
Shepherd's last game.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.752
You know, I don't know
if all this was meant

02:10.788 --> 02:13.541
to haunt me or help me,

02:13.578 --> 02:15.060
but, honestly...

02:15.324 --> 02:17.156
it's been kind of freeing.

02:17.462 --> 02:20.931
I used to think of Remi
as this boogey-woman, but...

02:21.163 --> 02:22.609
she's part of me.

02:22.679 --> 02:23.865
You really believe that?

02:23.932 --> 02:26.072
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

02:26.109 --> 02:27.736
I'm able to connect to parts of my past

02:27.773 --> 02:30.004
that aren't just triggering trauma.

02:30.281 --> 02:31.931
Oh. So, what category

02:31.968 --> 02:33.494
does this poetry that
you wrote fall into?

02:33.531 --> 02:34.751
- Don't. Give that to me.
- No.

02:34.788 --> 02:35.907
Don't...

02:35.944 --> 02:37.478
"Encroaching darkness."

02:37.515 --> 02:39.249
"A looming flock of ravens."

02:39.539 --> 02:41.582
"My hand on a cold window."

02:41.862 --> 02:44.152
"I look at the world, trapped."

02:44.296 --> 02:46.875
"The dark of night is my haven..."

02:46.912 --> 02:48.335
- Oh, stop!
- What?

02:49.757 --> 02:52.026
Who didn't have
a Gothic phase as a kid?

02:52.094 --> 02:53.392
- Uh...
- Okay? Except for you.

02:53.429 --> 02:54.859
Yeah. All right.

02:55.703 --> 02:56.978
Uh, that's Patterson.

02:57.015 --> 02:59.233
So we can get back to
your flock of ravens.

02:59.567 --> 03:00.999
Yeah, we can follow them into the

03:01.045 --> 03:02.494
haven of darkness.

03:02.531 --> 03:03.730
So, bad news,

03:03.767 --> 03:05.103
Jane has a deadly poison

03:05.140 --> 03:07.008
called tetrodotoxin on her body.

03:07.075 --> 03:08.890
- Wait, what?
- No. No-no-no-no-no!

03:08.927 --> 03:10.316
I-It's not in her body.

03:10.353 --> 03:11.680
It is on her body.

03:11.717 --> 03:13.992
- It is a tattoo we solved.
- I said "on her body."

03:14.029 --> 03:15.909
Why would that be grammatically
confusing for anybody?

03:15.945 --> 03:18.648
Wait, that's a super-dangerous
type of food poisoning, right?

03:18.725 --> 03:20.835
Like E. coli or salmonella?

03:20.922 --> 03:22.089
Okay, I guess we're not here

03:22.157 --> 03:23.726
because a few people had a bad burrito.

03:23.835 --> 03:27.023
TTX is a rare but deadly
marine bacteria.

03:27.101 --> 03:29.939
It is found in the guts
of the absolutely scrumptious

03:29.976 --> 03:31.227
fugu pufferfish...

03:31.264 --> 03:32.391
which, if you've never had it,

03:32.428 --> 03:33.708
it's like Russian roulette on a plate.

03:33.744 --> 03:35.304
It's a wild ride.
Also, there's no cure.

03:35.407 --> 03:37.980
Just a single drop
could kill in minutes.

03:38.285 --> 03:40.736
And my system has been
flagging every reported case,

03:40.773 --> 03:42.905
but none of it has seemed
out of the ordinary,

03:42.942 --> 03:44.009
until now.

03:44.046 --> 03:46.585
There have been 26 this morning.

03:46.664 --> 03:48.828
So far, half of the victims have died.

03:48.865 --> 03:50.898
- Any word from the CDC?
- A few, yeah...

03:50.935 --> 03:52.773
all of which are the "wear brown pants"

03:52.810 --> 03:53.911
level of terrifying.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.320
None of these victims consumed seafood.

03:55.357 --> 03:57.564
These poisonings are not
typical or natural.

03:57.601 --> 03:59.848
Were the victims targeted?
Are they connected in any way?

03:59.885 --> 04:01.786
No, aside form ingesting the toxin.

04:01.859 --> 04:04.460
So someone's messing with
New York City's food supply.

04:04.597 --> 04:06.064
This is an attack.

04:06.101 --> 04:08.531
So we need to find the source
of this TTX and stop it now.

04:08.625 --> 04:10.142
Patterson, Rich,
you guys work with CDC,

04:10.179 --> 04:11.773
see if you can find
where this is coming from.

04:11.829 --> 04:13.375
Weller, Jane, coordinate with NYPD.

04:13.475 --> 04:15.535
I'm gonna contact the mayor's
office and let them know

04:15.572 --> 04:16.851
this could be something big.

04:17.144 --> 04:18.279
Copy that.

04:20.613 --> 04:22.416
I got an update from the CDC.

04:22.475 --> 04:25.157
All of the victims
had one food in common

04:25.203 --> 04:26.651
that they consumed
in the last 12 hours.

04:26.688 --> 04:27.922
Cucumis melo.

04:27.989 --> 04:29.328
A.k.a., cantaloupe.

04:29.367 --> 04:30.976
People are dying
from eating cantaloupe?

04:31.063 --> 04:32.399
We put out a recall,

04:32.436 --> 04:34.452
but it's too late for anyone
who's already ingested it.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.630
How does poison from
a fish get into produce?

04:36.828 --> 04:38.188
We don't know the how, but we were able

04:38.225 --> 04:39.366
to track the where.

04:39.434 --> 04:41.539
All of the contaminated melons

04:41.648 --> 04:44.138
traced back to a research farm
outside Quaker Hill.

04:44.206 --> 04:45.773
We sent out a team
to secure the property,

04:45.841 --> 04:48.642
and the good news is
only one of the enclosures

04:48.710 --> 04:51.271
grew cantaloupe... Greenhouse 18.

04:51.336 --> 04:52.726
But whoever's renting the property

04:52.763 --> 04:54.297
is hiding behind shell companies.

04:54.398 --> 04:56.400
We were able to use qwerty sorcery

04:56.437 --> 04:58.419
to establish that
the receipts came from

04:58.487 --> 05:00.054
a building in Ozone Park.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.299
So this incident of
intentional food poisoning

05:02.336 --> 05:03.705
might just be the tip of the iceberg.

05:03.742 --> 05:05.216
And who knows what other deadly toxins

05:05.253 --> 05:06.821
they may be experimenting with.

05:06.923 --> 05:08.205
All right, Rich send us the address.

05:08.242 --> 05:09.361
Patterson, you're gonna come with us.

05:09.397 --> 05:10.598
If it's as dangerous as you say it is,

05:10.665 --> 05:12.185
we're gonna need your
scientific expertise.

05:12.221 --> 05:13.334
Okay.

05:13.556 --> 05:14.861
We gotta take these guys down

05:14.898 --> 05:16.322
before anyone else gets killed.

05:20.475 --> 05:22.209
FBI! Show me your hands!

05:22.277 --> 05:24.345
Don't move. Don't move.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.649
Honey...

05:30.352 --> 05:31.652
What's goin' on?

05:32.768 --> 05:33.899
Dad?

05:50.827 --> 05:54.665
The facility we raided,
is called Spelta Research Lab.

05:54.702 --> 05:58.350
They're privately funded by
Worldwide Science Innovation.

05:58.428 --> 06:00.132
And Bill Nye is one
of their lead consultants.

06:00.168 --> 06:01.928
Why didn't you tell me the
criminals are your family?

06:01.981 --> 06:03.816
I could have recommended
a fantastic support group.

06:03.899 --> 06:05.678
My dad wouldn't even let me
kill spiders as a kid.

06:05.714 --> 06:08.282
There's no way he poisoned
innocent people with TTX.

06:08.349 --> 06:09.617
I agree.

06:09.705 --> 06:11.209
Bill Nye is an American hero.

06:11.270 --> 06:14.171
No, I know a secret
bad guy when I see one.

06:14.289 --> 06:16.117
Bill Nye is about as bad as they come.

06:16.154 --> 06:17.968
That bowtie doesn't fool me one bit.

06:18.054 --> 06:20.181
Did you know your dad
was working for Spelta?

06:20.468 --> 06:22.529
No! He has so many jobs.

06:22.597 --> 06:24.859
I mean, he consults
at so many different places.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.765
But why would he keep
his work with the lab a secret

06:26.802 --> 06:29.132
unless there was something
nefarious about it?

06:29.203 --> 06:31.168
Because these labs are
covered by major NDAs.

06:31.265 --> 06:32.546
So even if he wanted to,

06:32.614 --> 06:34.181
he couldn't have told Patterson.

06:34.218 --> 06:35.819
This feels like Roman's doing.

06:35.864 --> 06:38.600
He designed certain tattoos
to create rifts within the team.

06:38.695 --> 06:40.017
Regardless, we still have to treat Bill

06:40.054 --> 06:41.974
- like any other suspect.
- Let me talk to him.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.862
I'm sure there's
an explanation for this.

06:43.922 --> 06:45.226
All right, I'll come with you.

06:45.263 --> 06:46.797
I mean, a familiar face
might help things.

06:47.218 --> 06:49.019
You mean like his daughter's?

06:49.528 --> 06:50.695
Y-Yeah.

06:50.765 --> 06:52.000
Patterson, you and Rich

06:52.037 --> 06:53.534
talk to Bill,
see what you can find out.

06:53.571 --> 06:54.781
And I want you two to go through

06:54.818 --> 06:56.218
the Sandstorm evidence
Shepherd left us.

06:56.254 --> 06:57.805
We have to figure out
why she sent us there

06:57.872 --> 06:59.339
and what this mystery man
has to do with it.

06:59.407 --> 07:00.941
- Okay.
- All right.

07:04.717 --> 07:06.335
- Hey...
- Hey.

07:06.372 --> 07:07.857
- Whoa.
- Dad, I can't hug you right now.

07:08.045 --> 07:09.772
- Gotta work.
- Sorry.

07:09.889 --> 07:11.385
It's just good to see you.

07:11.452 --> 07:13.187
Maybe I should get arrested more often.

07:13.254 --> 07:15.326
Do you understand how serious this is?

07:15.397 --> 07:18.525
Science Guy by day,
Poison Guy by night.

07:18.593 --> 07:19.660
It's a brilliant cover.

07:19.727 --> 07:20.894
So tell us, how'd ya do it?

07:20.962 --> 07:22.196
I didn't poison anybody.

07:22.263 --> 07:24.352
Dad... I want to believe you.

07:24.389 --> 07:26.485
But you taught me
to trust the evidence,

07:26.522 --> 07:28.902
and right now, everything
is pointing at you.

07:29.123 --> 07:31.586
You've been secretly
consulting at a lab

07:31.623 --> 07:33.063
that rents the greenhouse

07:33.100 --> 07:35.186
that grew modified poison cantaloupe.

07:35.223 --> 07:36.342
This is preposterous.

07:36.379 --> 07:38.142
I've worked alongside Bill
for three years.

07:38.179 --> 07:39.389
He is innocent...

07:39.426 --> 07:42.318
and I am willing to testify
on his behalf in court.

07:42.443 --> 07:44.188
I'm sorry, who are you supposed to be?

07:44.225 --> 07:45.490
This is Ginny Kelling,

07:45.527 --> 07:46.651
my research assistant.

07:46.688 --> 07:48.447
The Luke to my Yoda.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.836
Okay, that's... great.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.207
Ginny's great.

07:52.318 --> 07:53.957
But how did... how did this happen?

07:54.048 --> 07:56.360
How is the lab that you're working with

07:56.397 --> 07:57.725
connected to the contaminated melons?

07:57.762 --> 07:59.282
Honestly, this is the first
we've heard of it.

07:59.388 --> 08:00.834
We've been working on
a number of things:

08:00.902 --> 08:02.813
diversifying nutrient-dense crops,

08:02.850 --> 08:04.811
- urban farming...
- Bee repopulation.

08:04.848 --> 08:06.615
- Genetic modification...
- Okay.

08:06.841 --> 08:09.836
Which one of these
admittedly laudable pursuits

08:09.873 --> 08:11.965
do you use Greenhouse 18 for?

08:12.068 --> 08:13.764
Greenhouse 18...

08:13.842 --> 08:16.193
I believe is housing bees this winter.

08:16.242 --> 08:19.014
So which one of your staff is

08:19.051 --> 08:21.483
developing cantaloupe
as a murder weapon?

08:21.522 --> 08:24.311
'Cause TTX doesn't just wind up
in cantaloupe by accident.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.560
Have you looked into the
watering system at the farm?

08:26.628 --> 08:29.115
Bacteria can sit
in the water supply and...

08:29.152 --> 08:30.809
- Contaminate the food supply.
- ...supply.

08:30.848 --> 08:33.352
Ob-Obviously I know that.
That is why, uh,

08:33.389 --> 08:36.169
I... I already...
sent someone out there.

08:36.330 --> 08:37.775
You did?

08:38.404 --> 08:41.092
Oh, that's what that was. Yeah, yeah.

08:41.162 --> 08:43.289
I will let you know if
we have any more questions,

08:43.326 --> 08:44.912
but right now, this does not
look good for you.

08:44.979 --> 08:47.781
And until we can figure out
who is behind this attack,

08:48.169 --> 08:50.971
you will be treated as suspects.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.923
Shepherd gave me this in junior high.

08:56.221 --> 08:58.115
Toucans were my favorite animal.

08:58.259 --> 09:00.951
So your favorite animal was a parrot...

09:01.307 --> 09:03.783
and you wrote Goth poetry.

09:05.854 --> 09:07.454
- What's that?
- I don't know.

09:07.592 --> 09:09.070
Everything in this room is meaningful.

09:09.107 --> 09:11.482
I can place almost all of it
except this.

09:11.690 --> 09:13.053
I've never seen it before.

09:13.113 --> 09:14.380
Let's show it to Patterson.

09:14.506 --> 09:16.084
See if she can work out
what that symbol means.

09:16.170 --> 09:18.412
I think this card
belonged to the person

09:18.479 --> 09:20.326
- accessing the bunker.
- How do you know that?

09:20.363 --> 09:22.875
Remember how the mystery man or woman

09:22.912 --> 09:25.152
was wearing a green jacket
from Housley's Ribs?

09:25.210 --> 09:26.684
Wait, I thought this was a dead end.

09:26.746 --> 09:28.719
It was. But then I noticed

09:28.756 --> 09:30.590
this green stain on the card.

09:30.748 --> 09:34.016
I was able to find out
which dyes and materials

09:34.053 --> 09:35.359
the jackets are made of.

09:35.490 --> 09:38.967
And it's an exact match
for the pigment on the card.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.311
What, so the dye in the jacket

09:40.348 --> 09:41.668
must have bled through and stained it.

09:41.736 --> 09:43.496
They could have dropped
the card while in the bunker.

09:43.563 --> 09:44.695
What about the symbol?

09:44.732 --> 09:47.941
It is for Monroe's Shelter for Women.

09:48.009 --> 09:49.543
It's a few blocks from the bunker.

09:49.610 --> 09:51.011
So the hooded figure might be there.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.591
Chelsea Chalgren.

09:52.771 --> 09:55.182
Chelsea Chalgren. I know that name.

09:56.459 --> 09:59.086
Shepherd said she met a
Sandstorm informant through her.

09:59.123 --> 10:00.787
Good thing you have
your Remi memories back.

10:01.007 --> 10:02.945
Do you remember if she was
a part of Sandstorm?

10:02.982 --> 10:05.038
No, no, but she'll likely know

10:05.075 --> 10:06.646
who Shepherd was looking for.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.687
All right, so let's bring Chelsea in

10:08.732 --> 10:11.331
and see if she can identify
this mystery person.

10:11.399 --> 10:13.100
- Oh! Hey, heads up!
- Whoa.

10:13.167 --> 10:14.404
I got great news!

10:14.441 --> 10:15.871
You figured out how the tetrodotoxin

10:15.908 --> 10:16.974
got into the cantaloupes?

10:17.011 --> 10:18.153
I can't just touch things

10:18.190 --> 10:19.430
and figure out what happened to them.

10:19.466 --> 10:20.388
Who am I, Deanna Troi?

10:20.425 --> 10:21.925
Although I can feel people's energies.

10:21.962 --> 10:23.722
Can you feel my energy telling
you to get to the point?

10:23.758 --> 10:25.185
Okay, Ginny's brilliant idea

10:25.222 --> 10:26.631
was a big, fat load of nothing.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.115
The farm has one watering system,

10:28.152 --> 10:29.449
and it's TTX free.

10:29.552 --> 10:31.084
If the poison had come
from the water supply,

10:31.121 --> 10:32.519
the entire farm would be infected,

10:32.587 --> 10:34.097
but it's isolated to Greenhouse 18.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.365
You would think...
Ginny would know that

10:36.402 --> 10:38.203
if she worked there for three years.

10:38.425 --> 10:42.175
Unless... she's responsible
for the poisonings.

10:42.254 --> 10:44.334
Whoa. Excuse me. Is somebody jealous

10:44.371 --> 10:47.045
of Ginny's relationship
to their father, Bill Nye?

10:47.082 --> 10:48.498
I'm not jealous!

10:48.535 --> 10:50.732
Why would you be?
You got this great job.

10:50.769 --> 10:54.034
You got me. This lab. Me. I'm here.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.277
You have an exorbitant number
of tabletop board games.

10:56.394 --> 10:57.707
Okay...

10:57.815 --> 11:00.928
Ginny has access to
the lab and the farm,

11:00.965 --> 11:03.723
so she is the logical
explanation for all of this.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.240
Logical? Slow your roll there.

11:05.277 --> 11:07.060
Okay, let's just stick
to the science, all right?

11:07.097 --> 11:09.199
We need to figure out how the
poison got in the cantaloupes

11:09.254 --> 11:10.924
before there's another attack.

11:11.384 --> 11:12.847
Where are the scalpels?

11:12.988 --> 11:14.461
Anthony, where are my scalpels?

11:19.410 --> 11:22.402
You hadn't decided
which side you were truly on.

11:22.470 --> 11:23.637
You still haven't.

11:27.464 --> 11:29.365
Oh, thank God.

11:32.421 --> 11:34.330
Claudia... is everything all right?

11:34.367 --> 11:36.468
<i>I have to talk to you
about something important.</i>

11:36.859 --> 11:38.492
<i>I can't tell you over the phone.</i>

11:38.656 --> 11:39.936
<i>Is there somewhere secure we can meet?</i>

11:39.972 --> 11:40.944
<i>I'm in New York.</i>

11:41.020 --> 11:42.520
I know just the place.

11:44.046 --> 11:45.301
Whatcha got?

11:45.392 --> 11:47.241
Well, on top of the TTX, we also found

11:47.278 --> 11:48.545
traces of lactobacillus.

11:48.609 --> 11:50.343
It's a bacteria bees leave behind

11:50.380 --> 11:51.679
on plants when they pollinate.

11:51.769 --> 11:53.945
Didn't Bill say bees were being stored

11:53.982 --> 11:55.214
in Greenhouse 18?

11:55.251 --> 11:56.718
Yeah, about 30 hives' worth.

11:56.813 --> 11:58.843
Nobody say "candy man"
more than four times, okay?

11:58.880 --> 12:00.781
I'll get a field team to secure them.

12:00.999 --> 12:02.422
And you said TTX

12:02.489 --> 12:04.828
naturally occurs in
a certain type of fish, right?

12:04.865 --> 12:06.849
So how could the bees be carriers?

12:06.898 --> 12:08.804
Well, there's have to be
gene modification

12:08.841 --> 12:10.527
to get the bacteria into the bees,

12:10.564 --> 12:11.828
and the only way to do that would be

12:11.865 --> 12:13.833
with CRISPR technology.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.882
CRISPR is a family of DNA sequences...

12:16.919 --> 12:18.786
I bet Bill Nye has a video on this!

12:18.864 --> 12:20.601
I mean, he makes science fun.

12:20.671 --> 12:21.832
I can be fun.

12:21.869 --> 12:23.924
Hey! Kurt was right. I found something.

12:25.683 --> 12:27.984
<i>CRISPR stands for Clustered</i>

12:28.115 --> 12:29.710
<i>Regularly Interspaced</i>

12:29.747 --> 12:32.082
<i>Short Palindromic Repeats.</i>

12:32.304 --> 12:35.706
<i>We can use it to change
an organism's genes,</i>

12:36.039 --> 12:39.392
<i>the bits of DNA that determine
almost everything about us</i>

12:39.460 --> 12:40.927
<i>or any living thing.</i>

12:40.995 --> 12:42.428
<i>Our size, our shape,</i>

12:42.488 --> 12:44.594
<i>hair color, number of legs,</i>

12:44.631 --> 12:45.826
<i>and so on.</i>

12:45.863 --> 12:47.804
<i>Now, here are a pair of my pants</i>

12:47.843 --> 12:49.114
<i>that feature</i>

12:49.151 --> 12:51.725
<i>a serious mustard stain.</i>

12:51.805 --> 12:55.008
<i>Now, the stain represents
a genetic sequence</i>

12:55.075 --> 12:57.182
<i>that predisposes me to some syndrome,</i>

12:57.257 --> 13:00.007
<i>like "enthusiastic
hot dog consumption."</i>

13:00.116 --> 13:03.249
<i>Researchers can use CRISPR</i>

13:03.539 --> 13:06.065
<i>to go in and snip out...</i>

13:06.553 --> 13:09.230
<i>that... genetic sequence,</i>

13:09.267 --> 13:11.301
<i>and mend or replace it.</i>

13:11.592 --> 13:14.093
<i>It's like having a pair of scissors</i>

13:14.161 --> 13:17.063
<i>and a sewing kit all in one!</i>

13:17.234 --> 13:18.765
<i>For genes!</i>

13:18.929 --> 13:21.167
<i>Or... jeans!</i>

13:21.422 --> 13:24.069
Okay.

13:24.126 --> 13:25.893
That... is how you explain science.

13:25.969 --> 13:27.946
While you were enjoying
Genetic Modification

13:27.983 --> 13:29.651
Over-Simplification 101,

13:29.765 --> 13:32.838
I checked the Spelta files
and found this article.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.913
"Bee Populations."
What does that have to...

13:34.950 --> 13:36.718
Take a look at the author.

13:36.828 --> 13:37.981
Ginny Kelling?

13:38.048 --> 13:39.382
And there's a section in here about

13:39.419 --> 13:41.954
how this technology could
eradicate entire populations.

13:41.991 --> 13:44.804
So she's using bees as a
weapon to poison crops.

13:44.841 --> 13:46.659
Oh, I knew she was bad!

13:46.727 --> 13:48.484
The hives from the farm are missing.

13:48.521 --> 13:49.989
If those bees are released...

13:50.152 --> 13:51.939
they can kill millions of people.

13:59.328 --> 14:00.760
Why are you poisoning people?

14:00.797 --> 14:02.631
I'm not poisoning anyone.

14:02.698 --> 14:05.249
You wrote a thesis paper
on modifying bees.

14:05.311 --> 14:06.553
You have an entire section

14:06.590 --> 14:08.476
devoted to the deadly use
of your method.

14:08.513 --> 14:11.015
That is a research paper.
It's purely theoretical.

14:11.052 --> 14:13.754
37 real people are dead.

14:14.010 --> 14:15.327
That is more than a theory.

14:15.364 --> 14:18.680
You genetically modified
bees to carry TTX.

14:18.748 --> 14:20.415
Where have you taken the infected bees?

14:20.452 --> 14:21.640
I haven't taken them anywhere...

14:21.677 --> 14:23.427
We have a record of you
accessing the lab

14:23.464 --> 14:25.365
where they were being studied
after hours,

14:25.488 --> 14:27.210
you buying CRISPR equipment,

14:27.280 --> 14:29.214
and of you calling the farm.

14:29.319 --> 14:30.564
I would never do that to Bill.

14:30.601 --> 14:32.007
Oh, cut the act, Virginia!

14:32.044 --> 14:34.283
Ginny is not short for Virginia, okay?

14:34.997 --> 14:38.800
This is a requisition form
for 36 live cultures

14:38.868 --> 14:41.873
that are the same bacteria
that produces TTX.

14:41.941 --> 14:43.675
And that is your signature.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.207
Hold on, that's not me.

14:47.296 --> 14:49.411
No, I'm serious. That really isn't me!

14:49.479 --> 14:51.613
You see the date? That's my birthday!

14:51.681 --> 14:53.194
January 27th.

14:53.273 --> 14:55.450
Bill and your mom had me over!

14:55.689 --> 14:59.132
They made lasagna,
because it's my favorite.

14:59.226 --> 15:01.103
And there was no way
I could have signed

15:01.140 --> 15:03.556
and submitted that form at 8:56 p.m.,

15:03.593 --> 15:04.993
because I was too busy
kicking their butts

15:05.030 --> 15:06.521
at the Star Trek-themed
Settlers of Catan.

15:06.589 --> 15:07.679
Okay, you just said

15:07.716 --> 15:09.483
"this" wasn't you.

15:09.732 --> 15:11.718
Does that mean you confess
to the rest of it?

15:11.846 --> 15:14.579
I'm trying to help people,
not hurt them.

15:16.501 --> 15:19.236
I have been looking into
creating edible vaccines

15:19.273 --> 15:22.108
via pollination, just like in my paper.

15:22.278 --> 15:25.580
Imagine stopping flu season
with a piece of fruit.

15:25.765 --> 15:27.853
But I... I barely even started.

15:27.890 --> 15:30.785
I just ordered the bees
to begin testing... that's it.

15:30.952 --> 15:32.320
You sit tight.

15:32.388 --> 15:33.788
I'm gonna have to
corroborate your story.

15:33.824 --> 15:34.982
And you better hope we can,

15:35.019 --> 15:36.566
or the next lasagna you'll be eating

15:36.603 --> 15:39.321
will be off of a prison cafeteria tray!

15:43.214 --> 15:44.997
Yeah, we're done here!

15:47.374 --> 15:50.572
Right now, Ginny is
our most likely suspect

15:50.671 --> 15:52.974
and you've been making her
all my favorite foods.

15:53.042 --> 15:54.276
You mean Ginny's birthday dinner.

15:54.334 --> 15:56.149
Your mother and I
had her over. So what?

15:56.195 --> 15:57.843
Sir, we realize you want
to protect Ginny...

15:57.880 --> 16:00.115
No, I remember! It was January 27th.

16:00.182 --> 16:01.351
We made lasagna.

16:01.388 --> 16:03.384
You and Mom haven't had me over

16:03.421 --> 16:04.838
for my birthday in years.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.085
We invite you every year,

16:06.122 --> 16:07.742
but you always say you're busy.

16:07.779 --> 16:09.024
Your work is so important.

16:09.091 --> 16:10.851
You're... my little superhero.

16:10.952 --> 16:13.101
Which one? Batman, isn't it?

16:13.179 --> 16:15.509
Right? If she's Batman,
then I'm Catwoman, which is great,

16:15.546 --> 16:17.312
'cause I look fantastic
in a leather unitard.

16:17.349 --> 16:20.429
She's been genetically altering
bees right under your nose,

16:20.485 --> 16:22.546
and using your lab to do it.

16:23.695 --> 16:26.400
Ginny... I warned her not to use CRISPR

16:26.437 --> 16:27.664
to modify animals,

16:27.701 --> 16:30.670
but she was so certain this
project could help people.

16:30.829 --> 16:33.398
Look, it's like the time
you built that supercomputer.

16:33.435 --> 16:34.802
Remember, when you were nine?

16:34.839 --> 16:37.421
I told you not to do it,
but you did it anyway...

16:37.574 --> 16:39.289
and the power surge

16:39.326 --> 16:40.851
blacked out the whole neighborhood.

16:40.888 --> 16:44.557
I was helping Mom with her
nerve-mapping algorithm,

16:44.607 --> 16:46.656
and our IBM PS/1
just wasn't cutting it.

16:46.693 --> 16:49.023
And... and... I didn't kill anyone.

16:49.060 --> 16:50.148
Neither did Ginny!

16:50.185 --> 16:51.960
I hate to say it, but your dad's right.

16:52.060 --> 16:53.627
I don't hate to say that.
I love your dad.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.242
Love you, Dad.
I can call you that, right?

16:55.279 --> 16:56.789
That's not weird? Is that weird? Dad?

16:56.826 --> 16:58.078
Let's focus.

16:58.115 --> 16:59.585
If this requisition was forged,

16:59.622 --> 17:00.902
then that means someone had to fake it.

17:00.938 --> 17:02.925
So who was at the lab who
could have ordered the TTX?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.461
The way I'm remembering it,

17:04.498 --> 17:06.914
I left Nick Pomeroy in
charge of the lab that night.

17:06.951 --> 17:08.453
All right, let's track Nick down.

17:08.664 --> 17:11.154
Did Mom make the lasagna how I like it,

17:11.226 --> 17:12.726
with the... you know,

17:12.762 --> 17:14.230
little diced-up yellow squash?

17:14.272 --> 17:16.277
That's how you make lasagna!

17:17.406 --> 17:19.096
What couldn't you say over the phone?

17:19.203 --> 17:20.656
Madeline's in jail.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.805
Case all wrapped up
in a neat little bow?

17:22.842 --> 17:24.406
I don't think this is over.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.875
Neither do I, but MI6 does.

17:27.002 --> 17:29.972
When you arrested Madeline,
I returned to my life...

17:30.218 --> 17:31.904
ended the pretense of being dead.

17:32.274 --> 17:35.562
I was ready to get to work
and dismantle HCI Global.

17:36.112 --> 17:37.879
But they wanted me to sit at a desk

17:37.947 --> 17:39.914
and push papers with
my head in the sand.

17:39.982 --> 17:41.650
FBI's slow-rolling it, too.

17:41.717 --> 17:43.561
They don't know Madeline the way we do.

17:43.717 --> 17:45.404
That's why I came to you.

17:46.088 --> 17:48.796
You're the only one I trust with this.

17:48.951 --> 17:51.720
Not my team, not your bureau.

17:52.123 --> 17:54.583
I want to take down
Madeline's deadliest fixer.

17:55.181 --> 17:56.948
I intercepted coded text messages

17:56.985 --> 17:58.384
from a number I know to be his.

17:58.469 --> 18:00.080
- His name is...
- Dominic.

18:00.431 --> 18:01.903
We've met.

18:02.056 --> 18:03.892
What do you have in mind?

18:04.040 --> 18:05.501
Your name came up in connection

18:05.538 --> 18:07.281
to a case of ours, Chelsea.

18:07.946 --> 18:09.611
Do you know this woman?

18:14.062 --> 18:15.996
I'm not sure, I...

18:16.142 --> 18:19.578
My shelter helps hundreds
of women every month.

18:20.149 --> 18:22.223
Lying to the FBI
is a very serious crime.

18:22.291 --> 18:25.293
So think very carefully about
how you answer our questions.

18:28.962 --> 18:30.862
The details are a bit fuzzy,

18:30.970 --> 18:33.456
but... someone who looked like her

18:33.493 --> 18:35.294
came to my shelter years ago.

18:35.331 --> 18:36.879
She was looking
for someone who had been

18:36.916 --> 18:39.317
in and out of the shelter... Jessica.

18:39.542 --> 18:41.024
She wanted to protect her,

18:41.061 --> 18:42.425
just like I did.

18:42.493 --> 18:43.946
Wanted to know where to find her.

18:43.983 --> 18:46.306
Wait, so you gave Jessica's information

18:46.343 --> 18:47.778
to a complete stranger?

18:47.845 --> 18:50.106
Shelters are supposed to be havens.

18:50.143 --> 18:51.540
These women are vulnerable.

18:51.577 --> 18:53.182
They trust you.

18:54.571 --> 18:56.160
I slipped up.

18:57.672 --> 18:59.740
Do you recognize this person?

18:59.964 --> 19:01.486
I think that's Jessica.

19:01.523 --> 19:03.324
So, what makes you say that?

19:03.888 --> 19:06.556
It's been years
since I've seen Jessica.

19:07.471 --> 19:10.073
I convinced myself
I did the right thing.

19:10.203 --> 19:11.454
But then, a couple of weeks ago,

19:11.491 --> 19:13.586
Jessica came back to the shelter.

19:14.407 --> 19:16.540
And she was wearing that same jacket.

19:16.595 --> 19:18.457
Is Jessica at the shelter now?

19:18.532 --> 19:20.456
No. I haven't seen her since.

19:20.524 --> 19:21.993
Do you know Jessica's last name?

19:22.071 --> 19:24.206
A lot of women who come in
don't wanna be found

19:24.243 --> 19:25.778
and give fake names.

19:26.103 --> 19:28.034
She called herself Jessica Smith.

19:28.128 --> 19:29.628
If we brought in a sketch artist,

19:29.665 --> 19:31.633
- could you describe her?
- Yes.

19:31.917 --> 19:33.668
Anything I can do to help.

19:34.163 --> 19:36.097
Rich, can you send in a sketch artist

19:36.134 --> 19:37.270
to speak with Chelsea?

19:37.307 --> 19:38.933
If she gives us
something solid to go on,

19:38.970 --> 19:40.027
we might actually be able

19:40.064 --> 19:41.386
to bring in the Sandstorm informant.

19:41.423 --> 19:43.140
I know just the person for the job.

19:43.177 --> 19:44.444
Not Boston.

19:44.481 --> 19:46.616
Why do you hate me?

19:46.864 --> 19:48.521
Nick Pomeroy is in the wind.

19:48.639 --> 19:51.207
Our agents couldn't find
him at Spelta or his house.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.277
I've put a BOLO out and have
agents on his relatives.

19:53.314 --> 19:54.488
What do we know about him?

19:54.525 --> 19:57.755
36, has a doctorate in microbiology.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.878
Yeah, he applied for a raise last year.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.196
The company denied it.

20:01.233 --> 20:02.519
I know he wasn't happy,

20:02.556 --> 20:04.350
but I guess he was angrier
than I thought.

20:04.433 --> 20:05.808
Probably had a bee in his bonnet.

20:06.284 --> 20:08.289
Nice, Kurt. Solid bee pun.

20:08.326 --> 20:09.402
Oh, boy.

20:09.486 --> 20:10.590
All right, so it looks like

20:10.627 --> 20:12.228
Nick's credit score was so low

20:12.265 --> 20:13.485
it was in the double digits.

20:13.542 --> 20:14.787
Massive amounts of debt.

20:14.855 --> 20:16.324
Collection agencies are after him.

20:16.361 --> 20:18.370
He found me once
in the bee lab after hours.

20:18.407 --> 20:19.980
I thought he was gonna
rat me out to Bill, but...

20:20.017 --> 20:21.984
he must have been working
on his TTX experiments.

20:22.081 --> 20:23.863
He wouldn't have wanted
anyone to know he was there.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.523
So Nick co-opted your research

20:25.560 --> 20:27.280
and turned it into a deadly
weapon that would infect

20:27.316 --> 20:28.956
the food supply
and kill millions of people,

20:28.993 --> 20:30.097
and we have no idea where he is.

20:30.134 --> 20:31.601
If Nick and the bees are missing,

20:31.659 --> 20:33.059
it's a pretty good bet
they're together.

20:33.096 --> 20:34.997
They're too dangerous
to hold onto for too long,

20:35.057 --> 20:37.230
so why risk moving them?

20:37.358 --> 20:38.669
Unless he's planning on selling 'em.

20:38.706 --> 20:39.871
We have to find Nick and stop him

20:39.908 --> 20:42.181
before these poisonous
bees exchange hands.

20:42.764 --> 20:45.072
Wow, that is a crazy sentence.

20:57.704 --> 20:59.205
The sale is on.

20:59.334 --> 21:00.902
Transfer the down payment.

21:00.939 --> 21:02.467
Be at the meet in ten.

21:06.285 --> 21:07.917
Any update on Nick's whereabouts?

21:08.048 --> 21:10.232
He hasn't made a single
purchase or phone call,

21:10.269 --> 21:12.011
and no one has seen him
since yesterday.

21:12.050 --> 21:14.589
Yeah, what about the sale?
Anything on the dark web?

21:14.704 --> 21:15.964
No. Although,

21:16.003 --> 21:17.043
if Nick is selling these bees,

21:17.080 --> 21:18.360
he probably already knows the buyers.

21:18.396 --> 21:19.645
Right, he could have anyone lined up:

21:19.682 --> 21:21.909
terrorists organizations,
hostile foreign governments.

21:21.946 --> 21:23.744
Look, people, this is a weapon

21:23.781 --> 21:25.595
that could wipe out
an entire population.

21:25.632 --> 21:27.312
How do we know they aren't
already out in the world?

21:27.348 --> 21:29.042
Well, 'cause they couldn't
survive in the cold.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.546
If they got out,
they'd already be dead.

21:30.583 --> 21:32.665
Oh, God, the poor bees.

21:33.029 --> 21:35.998
Poor bees? You mean, poor humans.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.231
This killed 37 people
just as a proof of concept.

21:39.268 --> 21:40.901
Do you know how many more
people would die

21:40.938 --> 21:42.354
if this weapon was used globally?

21:42.391 --> 21:43.924
Humans can't survive without bees.

21:43.961 --> 21:45.262
Einstein once said that without them,

21:45.299 --> 21:47.434
humans would only have
four more years to live.

21:47.602 --> 21:50.770
Ginny's right, much of the food
we eat depends on pollination,

21:50.807 --> 21:52.620
and bees are already well on their way

21:52.657 --> 21:54.379
to becoming an endangered species.

21:54.432 --> 21:56.166
This would be very bad PR for them.

21:56.203 --> 21:58.571
Nick just received a wire
transfer of $40,000.

21:58.632 --> 21:59.783
Oh, God. We're too late.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.710
No, that kind of weapon
is worth way more than 40 grand.

22:02.747 --> 22:03.928
That's a down payment.

22:03.965 --> 22:06.812
Well, Rich and I will dig in
and see who's behind this.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.300
Yes, there's nothing
we can't accomplish

22:08.336 --> 22:10.912
if we put our heads together.
We're like two bees in a pod.

22:10.949 --> 22:12.750
Now is not the time. Here we go.

22:15.190 --> 22:17.424
If I hear that noise one more time.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.565
We have tried every cipher known

22:19.602 --> 22:21.112
between the FBI and MI6.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.278
Whatever code Dominic's
using, it's new.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.453
Without those messages,
we have nothing.

22:25.543 --> 22:27.177
I sent the code to my team at the FBI.

22:27.214 --> 22:28.979
If anyone can crack it, it's Patterson.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.783
I thought we agreed no teams.

22:30.856 --> 22:33.517
I came here for your help,
not the FBI's.

22:33.627 --> 22:34.932
Maybe I was wrong about you.

22:34.969 --> 22:37.649
Or maybe we're too close to this.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.151
Wait, that's it.

22:43.281 --> 22:44.915
We've been so focused
on decoding the "what"

22:44.952 --> 22:47.365
that we missed the "where"
right in front of us.

22:47.479 --> 22:49.823
If we bypass the coded messages

22:49.860 --> 22:51.675
and look into the phone's
encrypted meta data,

22:51.712 --> 22:53.025
we get the serial numbers.

22:53.092 --> 22:55.893
So we can figure out where the
phones were purchased and by whom.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.006
Genius.

22:57.081 --> 22:58.415
Dominic's phone is a dead end,

22:58.452 --> 23:00.613
but I got a hit on the other one.

23:00.650 --> 23:02.200
It was purchased

23:02.401 --> 23:03.948
at a convenience store in Brooklyn.

23:03.985 --> 23:07.389
It left their inventory
yesterday at 1 p.m.

23:07.628 --> 23:09.316
Do we have security footage?

23:09.353 --> 23:12.021
Uh...

23:16.893 --> 23:18.629
That is our guy.

23:21.694 --> 23:23.962
He knew not to get caught on tape.

23:24.163 --> 23:26.008
We keep hitting dead ends.

23:26.890 --> 23:28.925
I will send the footage
over to my team.

23:29.126 --> 23:31.213
- They will scan it...
- No! Are you mad?

23:31.580 --> 23:32.865
You're the reason

23:32.902 --> 23:35.219
we're still hunting
Dominic and HCI Global.

23:35.321 --> 23:36.561
Had I been the one to stay undercover,

23:36.598 --> 23:39.021
HCI Global would be
dust in the wind by now.

23:39.058 --> 23:41.280
Look, I understand that
you are frustrated...

23:41.317 --> 23:44.133
I am not the one
who failed the mission.

23:46.934 --> 23:49.836
Why don't we just take a breather

23:49.873 --> 23:51.184
and regroup in the morning?

23:51.221 --> 23:53.389
I'd rather figure it out on my own.

23:58.727 --> 24:00.228
Claudia!

24:01.631 --> 24:04.640
Nick Pomeroy got his
money from Fortified Agriculture,

24:04.677 --> 24:07.232
a front company for Alverson Aerospace,

24:07.300 --> 24:09.201
a defense contractor
that's also spent billions

24:09.268 --> 24:11.395
developing 3D-printed squid drones.

24:11.432 --> 24:13.432
And now they're buying and
positioning the bees as a weapon.

24:13.469 --> 24:14.677
That is very not good.

24:14.714 --> 24:16.943
Well,
releasing bees into enemy territories

24:16.980 --> 24:18.606
would be easier than dropping a bomb.

24:18.701 --> 24:22.372
Plus, the TTX-causing bacteria
is all over the bees' guts,

24:22.409 --> 24:25.377
which means...
the stings are deadly, too.

24:25.414 --> 24:26.771
They might be looking to use CRISPR

24:26.808 --> 24:28.235
to modify other creatures into weapons.

24:28.272 --> 24:30.179
More people could die.
This is all my fault.

24:30.216 --> 24:31.982
- I'm so sorry.
- We need to stop this sale

24:32.019 --> 24:33.453
and take down Alverson Aerospace.

24:33.489 --> 24:35.279
They would need a place
to keep the bees

24:35.323 --> 24:36.794
and amass a larger population.

24:36.849 --> 24:39.117
Bees are homebodies.
They don't travel well.

24:39.154 --> 24:40.998
So, they'll likely do
the sale in the same place

24:41.035 --> 24:42.808
Alverson plans to mass produce them.

24:43.016 --> 24:44.536
If they're planning
to propagate more bees,

24:44.573 --> 24:46.099
they need tons of indoor space

24:46.136 --> 24:47.601
and the energy to heat it,

24:47.638 --> 24:49.372
plus, they'd require
a massive generator

24:49.409 --> 24:50.985
to kick in for power outages.

24:51.091 --> 24:52.661
- Okay, what else ya got?
- Um...

24:52.716 --> 24:53.844
uh, ventilation.

24:53.927 --> 24:56.682
Yes! The space would be
heavily modified.

24:56.749 --> 24:58.927
Look for buildings
that have been retrofitted

24:58.964 --> 25:01.365
with ventilation systems
to control smoke.

25:01.402 --> 25:03.508
And they probably want it
to be pretty remote,

25:03.545 --> 25:06.033
just to keep it hidden.

25:07.138 --> 25:09.083
Yeah, that's... that's good, too.

25:09.562 --> 25:11.685
Okay, there are a dozen warehouses

25:11.722 --> 25:12.857
in the New York vicinity

25:12.894 --> 25:14.748
that qualify all those requirements,

25:14.785 --> 25:15.967
and if we factor in recent

25:16.004 --> 25:17.426
construction on the property,

25:17.463 --> 25:19.302
- we're down to three.
- Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait.

25:19.372 --> 25:20.439
Let me look at that.

25:20.506 --> 25:22.701
As of two weeks ago, a subsidiary

25:22.738 --> 25:25.277
of Alverson Aerospace
purchased that warehouse.

25:25.344 --> 25:26.704
All right, we all know what to do.

25:26.740 --> 25:28.072
Let's move.

25:28.247 --> 25:29.655
Be safe!

25:29.981 --> 25:32.215
Oh! "Bee" safe.

25:32.385 --> 25:34.426
Kind of... kind of fell
backwards into that one.

25:35.406 --> 25:38.641
I never meant for the melons
to get out into the world.

25:38.936 --> 25:41.590
I just wanted to be sure
that the CRISPR worked.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.361
Our boss had to make sure
you were legit.

25:43.429 --> 25:44.716
We made a quick call to the farm,

25:44.753 --> 25:46.014
pretending to be you,

25:46.051 --> 25:47.491
and told them to sell
the crops you'd grown.

25:47.527 --> 25:49.434
You just killed dozens of people.

25:49.471 --> 25:51.672
And you're about to be a very rich man.

25:56.177 --> 25:58.174
FBI! Show us your hands!

26:05.008 --> 26:06.108
Unh!

26:24.916 --> 26:26.849
- Jane! No!
- Aah!

26:26.911 --> 26:28.273
Don't let those bees out of the truck!

26:28.341 --> 26:29.583
It's too late for me!

26:29.620 --> 26:30.909
I'm so sorry.

26:42.325 --> 26:45.809
And that is why you
don't mess with the FBI.

26:45.916 --> 26:47.559
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

26:47.614 --> 26:48.915
Where's... where's Bill?

26:48.952 --> 26:50.253
Back at Spelta Labs.

26:50.429 --> 26:53.064
Nick had stores of infected bees there,

26:53.132 --> 26:54.653
and they're looking into

26:54.700 --> 26:56.401
taking out the TTX using CRISPR.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.481
So, he's trying to cure
the infected bees?

26:58.518 --> 26:59.718
That's pretty adorable.

26:59.755 --> 27:01.823
He is the nicest guy in the world.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.212
Why didn't you go with him?

27:04.249 --> 27:06.050
I... They don't need my help.

27:06.087 --> 27:08.348
And plus, I have so much work
to do here anyway, so...

27:08.385 --> 27:10.603
Hey... there's more to life than work.

27:10.731 --> 27:12.866
I'd kill to have Bill Nye as my dad.

27:13.059 --> 27:14.848
There's always
gonna be plenty of excuses

27:14.885 --> 27:16.155
to not spend time with family,

27:16.192 --> 27:17.538
but one day they're not gonna be here,

27:17.575 --> 27:20.453
and you're gonna wish
you had more chances.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.791
Okay. All right.

27:22.880 --> 27:25.257
I'll go relieve Agent O'Neil.

27:27.754 --> 27:28.809
Hey, O'Neil.

27:28.846 --> 27:29.997
You can head back to the NYO.

27:30.042 --> 27:31.467
I got this.

27:32.237 --> 27:33.618
Hey.

27:34.309 --> 27:35.869
Hi, kiddo. What are you doing here?

27:35.906 --> 27:38.140
I just wanted to see
if you needed any help.

27:38.302 --> 27:40.333
Well, sad to say,

27:40.370 --> 27:42.212
that we can't get the
toxin out of the bee.

27:42.278 --> 27:45.638
Introducing RNA that
destroys the TTX bacteria...

27:45.947 --> 27:47.381
also kills the host.

27:47.418 --> 27:48.676
It breaks my heart, but it looks like

27:48.713 --> 27:49.986
we'll have to euthanize the bees

27:50.023 --> 27:51.153
and start over with a new hive.

27:51.190 --> 27:53.591
No! That's not a solution. Y-You...

27:53.856 --> 27:55.724
It can't just be out with
the old and in

27:55.761 --> 27:56.856
with a newer, younger version.

27:56.893 --> 27:58.043
These bees have a history,

27:58.080 --> 27:59.680
and you can't just erase that
and then replace it

27:59.716 --> 28:01.168
with a whole new fresh crop.

28:01.205 --> 28:03.869
That's... No. You gotta fix this.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.942
Ginny, may I have a minute
alone with my daughter?

28:08.807 --> 28:10.036
Sure.

28:13.387 --> 28:16.356
This isn't about bees, is it, kiddo?

28:16.618 --> 28:18.924
I'm not replacing you with Ginny.

28:19.242 --> 28:20.965
Nothing can replace a child.

28:21.003 --> 28:23.043
It's just that you have
your own important

28:23.080 --> 28:25.314
and very busy life these days.

28:25.602 --> 28:28.822
We're like, uh, Neptune and Pluto.

28:29.005 --> 28:31.239
We're in different orbits.

28:32.532 --> 28:34.367
You're calling me a dwarf planet?

28:35.377 --> 28:37.392
Uh...

28:37.526 --> 28:39.160
Dad, get behind me!

28:41.704 --> 28:42.879
Please...

29:15.350 --> 29:16.536
<i>You lied to me.</i>

29:16.573 --> 29:18.293
Ugh, we're spies.
That's kind of our job.

29:18.330 --> 29:20.436
You know that man on the
surveillance video, don't you?

29:20.473 --> 29:21.817
<i>Yeah, I had a few run-ins with him</i>

29:21.854 --> 29:23.734
while I was working for Madeline.
Did I not mention that?

29:23.771 --> 29:25.158
You didn't leave because I was failing.

29:25.195 --> 29:26.528
<i>You went to go chase down this lead.</i>

29:26.565 --> 29:27.899
You know as well as I do,

29:27.936 --> 29:29.336
sometimes you have to
do things on your own

29:29.373 --> 29:30.755
- if you want to get them done.
- Claudia,

29:30.792 --> 29:32.237
he is too dangerous.

29:32.305 --> 29:33.638
Wait for my team.

29:33.706 --> 29:35.841
- <i>We can back you up.</i>
- Goodbye, Tasha.

29:36.188 --> 29:38.471
I'll look you up next time
I'm in New York.

29:43.817 --> 29:45.246
You want to drop your piece,

29:45.283 --> 29:46.750
so I don't have to kill your friends?

29:46.874 --> 29:48.155
Okay.

29:49.075 --> 29:51.228
Nobody... nobody has to get hurt here.

29:51.265 --> 29:52.582
We'll see about that.

29:52.684 --> 29:54.392
Kick it over here.

29:55.495 --> 29:57.658
Go.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.029
What do you want from us?

29:59.068 --> 30:00.858
That guy Pomeroy told my boss

30:00.895 --> 30:03.041
there were more killer bees
in this lab.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.513
So, we're here to collect.

30:04.596 --> 30:06.440
- Where are they?
- They're dangerous.

30:06.627 --> 30:08.161
If you release those insects
into the world,

30:08.198 --> 30:09.863
you'll kill millions of people.

30:10.321 --> 30:11.864
You're gonna get us those bugs.

30:12.043 --> 30:13.443
You're gonna get 'em
ready for transport,

30:13.479 --> 30:15.380
or we're gonna kill him.

30:15.581 --> 30:18.216
I don't know, man.
You know who this is?

30:18.253 --> 30:20.036
I don't care if he's Mary,
Queen of Scots.

30:20.073 --> 30:22.036
I count to five, they aren't helping,

30:22.121 --> 30:24.200
- you shoot 'em dead.
- Okay...

30:24.237 --> 30:26.754
Let me take you to them, and just

30:26.871 --> 30:28.293
leave the two of them out of
this, okay?

30:28.330 --> 30:30.164
And take away your motivation?

30:30.463 --> 30:33.114
No way. Let's go.

30:34.317 --> 30:35.532
You too.

30:35.568 --> 30:37.775
No.

30:38.304 --> 30:41.238
Chaz, keep an eye on the science guy.

30:45.488 --> 30:46.722
Something doesn't feel right.

30:46.759 --> 30:48.293
I'm all abuzz with anxiety.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.749
Uh, what are you trying to say, Rich?

30:50.816 --> 30:53.714
The agent that Patterson
was supposed to relieve, O'Neil?

30:53.785 --> 30:55.905
He hasn't come back. And neither
of them are picking up my calls.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.123
What if Alverson Aerospace
didn't give up after that sale?

30:58.167 --> 30:59.357
Not gonna take any chances.

30:59.394 --> 31:00.834
You two take a team over to Spelta Labs

31:00.871 --> 31:02.024
and make sure everything's fine.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.381
We'll stay here and
hold the fort in case

31:03.417 --> 31:04.603
O'Neil gets back.

31:09.066 --> 31:10.902
Go on, get 'em ready for transport.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.779
Okay, okay, okay. We're gonna do it.

31:12.844 --> 31:14.545
We just need a little space

31:14.582 --> 31:15.883
to work, please?

31:16.121 --> 31:17.582
We have a lot that needs to be done.

31:17.619 --> 31:18.953
You got five minutes,

31:19.207 --> 31:21.146
then whichever one of you
I decide to keep

31:21.285 --> 31:23.348
finishes the job alone.

31:23.416 --> 31:25.025
Okay. Okay.

31:25.062 --> 31:26.152
Move it!

31:26.189 --> 31:28.066
All right, here we go.

31:28.103 --> 31:29.352
We're gonna do this.

31:29.485 --> 31:30.719
We're not really doing this, are we?

31:30.756 --> 31:32.224
No-no-no-no-no. We're just gonna,

31:32.261 --> 31:33.959
uh, pretend. Look busy.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.626
We just got to figure out
a way to stop them, okay?

31:35.662 --> 31:37.644
- Okay. Oh, no.
- Okay. It's okay.

31:37.681 --> 31:39.382
Just stay calm, okay?

31:39.419 --> 31:41.453
We're gonna be fine as long
as we keep our heads.

31:42.011 --> 31:43.902
- They're gonna behead us?
- Oh, no-no-no-no-no.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.570
Look at this. I need you to stand here,

31:45.638 --> 31:48.073
and I need you to type
the periodic table, okay?

31:48.140 --> 31:49.207
I find that it centers me.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.222
Okay.

31:51.510 --> 31:52.611
I should have listened to Bill

31:52.669 --> 31:54.437
when he told me not to modify bees.

31:54.474 --> 31:56.142
Now we're gonna die
and it's all my fault.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.616
I was just trying to impress him.

31:57.777 --> 31:59.793
He talks about you all the time.

32:01.003 --> 32:03.254
I mean, you built a
supercomputer when you were nine.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.653
- Eh...
- How can I possibly compare to you?

32:05.785 --> 32:08.153
Hey... you compare.

32:08.628 --> 32:11.296
Your proposal to spread
vaccines through food,

32:11.364 --> 32:12.530
that is brilliant.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.326
You got three minutes, ladies!

32:14.363 --> 32:15.900
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

32:16.381 --> 32:17.715
Just gettin' there.

32:21.544 --> 32:23.024
It's Agent O'Neil.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.711
No pulse. We got to get to Patterson.

32:26.974 --> 32:28.269
And Bill.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.679
Chaz...

32:43.716 --> 32:45.597
You ever wonder what the difference is

32:45.665 --> 32:47.932
between a regular western honey bee

32:48.000 --> 32:49.634
and a killer bee?

32:49.702 --> 32:51.302
I'd imagine, the killin' part.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.966
That's right. That's very good.

32:53.044 --> 32:56.141
But what happened is,
bees from Africa were...

32:59.712 --> 33:01.824
Bill! You okay?

33:01.927 --> 33:03.261
Yeah. Yeah.

33:03.416 --> 33:04.616
Where's Patterson and Ginny?

33:04.684 --> 33:06.068
Oh! Oh, uh...

33:06.122 --> 33:08.937
the mercenaries took 'em down to Lab 7.

33:08.974 --> 33:11.103
There were two guys with them and, uh,

33:11.140 --> 33:13.808
Pomeroy has two infected
hives down there.

33:13.845 --> 33:15.212
They're in danger.

33:15.250 --> 33:17.929
Now, look, this is my daughter, okay?

33:18.152 --> 33:20.453
I'm going down there with you.

33:21.148 --> 33:22.615
What are you doing?

33:23.324 --> 33:25.070
It's a reactant.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.044
Once the filtration is off...

33:27.089 --> 33:29.683
I don't need a science
lecture, just do it!

33:29.761 --> 33:31.843
You got a minute
before one of you dies.

33:31.911 --> 33:34.084
Okay, just... just take it easy.

33:34.121 --> 33:36.596
This is very, very,
very, very sensitive work.

33:37.238 --> 33:38.676
Plus, it's crazy,

33:38.713 --> 33:40.477
'cause I can't stop thinking about

33:40.807 --> 33:42.427
Einstein's theory of relativity

33:42.464 --> 33:46.175
and how it applies
to synchronizing clocks.

33:46.332 --> 33:50.095
You want to set two clocks
to exactly the same time,

33:50.402 --> 33:53.490
you need photoreceptive cells

33:53.527 --> 33:55.400
to attach to each clock,

33:55.468 --> 33:59.777
because the speed of light, "B," is...

33:59.863 --> 34:01.039
You mean, the speed of light, "C."

34:01.107 --> 34:02.874
Time's up, ladies!

34:08.686 --> 34:10.487
Okay.

34:16.021 --> 34:18.510
Okay. Yeah?

34:27.333 --> 34:28.500
Keep spraying!

34:28.567 --> 34:29.900
It'll keep them off of us!

34:36.033 --> 34:37.295
Oh...

34:39.578 --> 34:41.312
Ginny...

34:41.380 --> 34:43.199
Hey, we need to figure out
how to get the bees

34:43.237 --> 34:45.083
back in the hives, okay?

34:45.525 --> 34:47.952
- Um, leave it to me.
- Okay.

34:48.020 --> 34:50.088
- Okay, okay.
- All right. Slow.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.524
- Slow.
- Okay.

34:53.143 --> 34:55.760
I'm releasing lemongrass
into the hives.

34:56.350 --> 34:57.817
The smell mimics the queen's scent

34:57.854 --> 34:59.331
and attracts them.

34:59.799 --> 35:02.934
Now, smoke masks
the defensive pheromones

35:03.002 --> 35:05.074
that triggers them to attack.

35:05.111 --> 35:06.778
Okay...

35:20.653 --> 35:22.020
Okay...

35:22.401 --> 35:24.079
And now, we can close the hives.

35:28.427 --> 35:29.761
- Oh, my God.
- My God!

35:30.039 --> 35:31.145
Oh, my God.

35:31.182 --> 35:32.965
See? See how impressive you are?

35:33.002 --> 35:34.130
Plus, I was panicking for a second

35:34.167 --> 35:35.591
because I didn't think that
you were gonna get my code

35:35.627 --> 35:36.811
to get the bees out of the hive.

35:36.848 --> 35:37.981
I almost didn't, but then you said

35:38.018 --> 35:40.218
the speed of light is "B," and I'm
like, "Come on, everybody knows"

35:40.255 --> 35:41.736
- "the speed of light is 'C.'"
- That it's "C"!

35:41.772 --> 35:42.336
Oh, yes!

35:42.385 --> 35:44.008
Okay. Hey!

35:44.963 --> 35:46.044
- Oh!
- Hey!

35:46.081 --> 35:47.314
Oh, my God, Bill!

35:47.351 --> 35:48.911
- Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.
- Yeah.

35:48.948 --> 35:50.245
- Both of you.
- Yep.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.661
Are the bees contained?

35:52.384 --> 35:55.019
- Yeah.
- All of 'em. Yeah.

35:55.087 --> 35:56.988
I... I couldn't have
done this without Ginny.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.950
- Nice work.
- Yeah.

36:01.043 --> 36:02.777
Thanks.

36:07.556 --> 36:09.177
Reade... look, I know I'm not

36:09.214 --> 36:10.435
supposed to be working,

36:10.502 --> 36:12.971
but when you get this send
backup to my location.

36:13.038 --> 36:16.307
Claudia showed up.
We're on Dominic's trail.

36:16.375 --> 36:17.508
And...

36:44.743 --> 36:46.310
I tried to stop her but I couldn't,

36:46.347 --> 36:47.714
and now she's dead.

36:50.719 --> 36:52.587
Coulda been me.

36:59.499 --> 37:03.068
I've been on my own
for such a long time,

37:03.252 --> 37:06.185
I forgot what it's like
to work with other people.

37:07.044 --> 37:08.911
To be a team.

37:12.483 --> 37:14.717
And I'm so tired.

37:17.082 --> 37:18.817
- I'm sorry I didn't listen...
- No. No.

37:18.854 --> 37:20.622
You don't have to apologize, I do.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.873
I haven't been there for you.

37:24.916 --> 37:27.872
I know you have the team,
but you also have me.

37:28.787 --> 37:32.056
I promise, I'll be
a better friend to you.

37:35.446 --> 37:37.591
And you're not alone.

37:37.952 --> 37:40.220
We're gonna catch
whoever killed Claudia.

37:42.407 --> 37:43.974
Together.

37:45.427 --> 37:47.095
You hear me?

37:59.498 --> 38:01.451
Ecuadorian authorities brought in

38:01.488 --> 38:03.323
the head of Alverson Aerospace.

38:03.410 --> 38:05.334
- He's awaiting extradition.
- As for the company,

38:05.371 --> 38:06.709
they won't be getting their stingers

38:06.746 --> 38:09.129
into anything sinister anytime soon.

38:09.526 --> 38:10.724
No.

38:10.888 --> 38:13.357
Hey. I'm so sorry about Claudia.

38:13.394 --> 38:14.877
I'm really glad you're okay.

38:14.914 --> 38:16.261
Can we do anything?

38:16.298 --> 38:19.630
No. You guys are here.
That's... that's enough.

38:19.782 --> 38:23.018
This might help. I was able to decode

38:23.055 --> 38:25.552
some of Dominic's messages
that Claudia gave you.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.709
- What'd it say?
- All right, Barry says,

38:27.746 --> 38:29.112
"Sent you the Helios plans."

38:29.149 --> 38:30.610
"Got the device you asked for."

38:30.647 --> 38:31.988
And Dominic responded,

38:32.025 --> 38:34.226
"I need it to be
ten times more powerful."

38:34.700 --> 38:36.609
Well, that certainly
does sound terrifying.

38:36.646 --> 38:37.873
All right, we need to find this guy

38:37.910 --> 38:39.723
and take him down before
he does any more damage.

38:39.760 --> 38:42.083
Helios is Madeline's plan.

38:42.136 --> 38:44.208
It was on her SD card.

38:44.768 --> 38:46.736
Which means Dominic
is still working for her.

38:46.773 --> 38:47.826
Zapata's right.

38:47.863 --> 38:49.776
Madeline might be locked up,
but she is not done.

38:49.965 --> 38:51.989
We stop Dominic, we end this.

38:56.508 --> 38:57.941
I tell everybody the story

38:57.978 --> 38:59.334
of when you shut down the power

38:59.371 --> 39:00.421
to the whole neighborhood.

39:00.482 --> 39:02.099
Why? That is so embarrassing.

39:02.136 --> 39:03.335
Oh, no.

39:03.372 --> 39:04.906
I was so proud of you.

39:05.356 --> 39:08.225
All the other kids were
sticking pennies up their noses,

39:08.262 --> 39:10.301
and you were out there
changing the world.

39:10.453 --> 39:11.753
Okay, Dad.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.310
Oh, you don't get it right now,

39:13.347 --> 39:14.480
but one day you'll understand,

39:14.623 --> 39:15.952
when you have kids.

39:16.075 --> 39:18.482
I mean, I am so proud of you, kiddo.

39:18.629 --> 39:20.779
All that you've accomplished.

39:21.396 --> 39:24.194
I mean, what more do you want?

39:25.265 --> 39:27.366
Maybe I should come over this weekend

39:27.403 --> 39:28.770
for some lasagna.

39:28.963 --> 39:30.505
- Absolutely.
- 'Kay.

39:30.783 --> 39:33.551
And, uh... bring your boyfriend.

39:33.873 --> 39:34.966
My what?

39:35.033 --> 39:36.868
Okay, okay, if it's unofficial,

39:36.905 --> 39:38.339
I get it.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.777
But watching you and Rich
work together...

39:40.922 --> 39:42.427
I mean, you two have more chemistry

39:42.464 --> 39:45.248
than... Pierre and Marie Curie.

39:45.419 --> 39:47.999
I am not dating Rich.

39:49.209 --> 39:51.442
Clearly we need to spend
more time together.

39:53.623 --> 39:55.891
You can stay for as long as you like.

39:56.969 --> 39:59.763
I won't stay long, I promise.

40:00.068 --> 40:02.202
I'm gonna go look
at apartments tomorrow.

40:03.787 --> 40:06.091
Okay, I can come with you to...

40:06.473 --> 40:08.223
to help, if you want.

40:09.754 --> 40:11.221
Thanks.

40:12.620 --> 40:14.100
If you're gonna stay here,
though, you gotta

40:14.137 --> 40:15.924
figure out how to clean up
after your damn self.

40:16.162 --> 40:18.919
Fine, as long as you get
a damn coffee maker.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.483
Well, that's not gonna happen.

40:20.630 --> 40:22.270
In the meantime, though,
I'm gonna make some tea.

40:22.306 --> 40:24.128
- You want some?
- Sure.

40:24.310 --> 40:28.685
We have chamomile, chai, ginger...

40:28.798 --> 40:30.766
You know what, I'm just...
just gonna make lemon.

40:31.216 --> 40:34.052
You want some honey... with your tea?

40:40.105 --> 40:41.940
Cheers.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.387
Hmm...

40:44.528 --> 40:48.128
These last few months have been...

40:49.111 --> 40:50.478
They haven't been easy.

40:50.686 --> 40:52.120
But I finally feel like things

40:52.157 --> 40:53.724
are where they're supposed to be.

40:54.370 --> 40:56.653
I love getting to know
everything about you.

40:56.940 --> 40:59.508
Your past, your present...

41:00.380 --> 41:01.880
your future.

41:02.685 --> 41:04.649
I love it.

41:09.171 --> 41:10.928
- No, no...
- Well, who's...?

41:10.965 --> 41:12.304
- No...
- Hold that thought.

41:12.341 --> 41:14.025
I am holding that thought.

41:22.037 --> 41:23.547
Am I interrupting something?

41:23.702 --> 41:24.771
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:24.849 --> 41:26.477
Oh, really, do you need
someone to film it?

41:26.514 --> 41:28.053
- No.
- Okay, well,

41:28.090 --> 41:29.387
the offer's on the table.

41:29.424 --> 41:30.685
Rich, what are you doing here?

41:30.722 --> 41:32.223
Oh, I thought you'd wanna
see the sketch

41:32.260 --> 41:33.647
of the Sandstorm informant

41:33.684 --> 41:35.269
the moment it was completed.

41:35.306 --> 41:37.841
Look, whoever this is gave
Shepherd vital information.

41:37.878 --> 41:39.626
We don't know what this could kick off.

41:39.706 --> 41:41.779
There could be sleeper cells
about to activate.

41:41.816 --> 41:44.556
Whatever or whoever that is...

41:45.002 --> 41:46.922
- we'll deal with it.
- Yeah.

41:47.013 --> 41:48.880
There's not much Shepherd can do to...

41:48.917 --> 41:50.885
surprise me anymore.

41:52.961 --> 41:54.334
What?

41:54.426 --> 41:56.600
Kurt, isn't... isn't this...?

41:57.404 --> 41:59.119
Isn't this what?

41:59.508 --> 42:01.475
What? Who is that?

42:05.665 --> 42:07.433
That is my mother.
