WEBVTT

02:32.422 --> 02:35.046
Where is that real estate lady?

02:35.047 --> 02:38.005
She probably meant four
o'clock in the afternoon.

02:38.006 --> 02:40.005
Four o'clock in the afternoon?

02:40.006 --> 02:41.089
When does she sleep?

02:45.714 --> 02:47.756
It's what we call a fixer upper.

02:48.756 --> 02:52.046
Tell me, are we convenient
to the school here?

02:52.047 --> 02:53.921
Oh, yes, the school
is just two blocks away.

02:53.922 --> 02:57.796
And young children will
walk past here regularly?

02:57.797 --> 02:59.630
Do you two have children?

02:59.631 --> 03:00.797
As often as we can.

03:02.214 --> 03:03.214
Waldemar?

03:05.964 --> 03:07.713
Ask no more questions.

03:07.714 --> 03:11.005
We're supposed to be typical
people looking for a home.

03:11.006 --> 03:13.838
I am looking for a way into this house.

03:13.839 --> 03:17.172
You ask normal questions.

03:19.214 --> 03:21.755
Tell me, what does the building code

03:21.756 --> 03:25.296
say about filling the basement with earth?

03:25.297 --> 03:28.296
Well, um, it is a finished basement.

03:28.297 --> 03:29.338
Not yet it isn't.

03:30.547 --> 03:35.088
Oh, I do love this house.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.338
Um, there may be one small problem.

03:37.339 --> 03:38.713
It doesn't matter what it cost.

03:38.714 --> 03:39.880
Oh, it's not a matter of cost.

03:39.881 --> 03:41.880
We must get into this house.

03:41.881 --> 03:43.296
We've looked for such a long time.

03:43.297 --> 03:45.588
A very, very long time.

03:45.589 --> 03:47.796
For just this house.

03:47.797 --> 03:51.713
Well, you see, a few days ago
right after you called me...

03:51.714 --> 03:52.880
"The disposition"

03:52.881 --> 03:54.088
"of will shall be entrusted"

03:54.089 --> 03:57.171
"to my friend and attorney,
T. Armstrong Sedgeway."

03:57.172 --> 03:58.713
- Oh.
- You know,

03:58.714 --> 04:00.088
<i>I don't understand it.</i>

04:00.089 --> 04:01.588
Whenever I asked him for anything,

04:01.589 --> 04:03.171
he always said, "Leave it to me."

04:03.172 --> 04:05.546
So I figured he'd leave something to me.

04:05.547 --> 04:08.713
"And to my sister Lucille",

04:08.714 --> 04:12.338
"who could always be counted
on to borrow anything I had"

04:12.339 --> 04:14.130
"and not return it,"

04:14.131 --> 04:17.755
"I leave 3,000 overdue library books."

04:17.755 --> 04:19.546
That's all?

04:19.547 --> 04:22.671
That's all I get for being
his sister all these years?

04:26.214 --> 04:28.256
He does have one more thing for you.

04:36.172 --> 04:37.630
After what everybody else has gotten,

04:37.631 --> 04:39.338
I think we're better off he forgot us.

04:39.339 --> 04:42.921
"And to my nephew
John and his wife, Mary,

04:42.922 --> 04:46.380
"I leave my vast estate in Eerie,

04:46.381 --> 04:48.171
"Pennsylvania."
Oh.

04:48.172 --> 04:49.338
No.

04:49.339 --> 04:51.505
John, our own house.

04:51.506 --> 04:54.505
I played in that house
when I was a little boy.

04:54.506 --> 04:56.546
With all its surrounding land.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.963
We'll have a garden.

04:58.964 --> 04:59.881
Now we don't have to be afraid

04:59.882 --> 05:02.046
to let the children go out and play.

05:02.047 --> 05:03.796
That house is mine.

05:03.797 --> 05:07.296
"My attorney shall inform John and Mary"

05:07.297 --> 05:08.755
"of the curse on the house."

05:08.756 --> 05:10.130
Curse?

05:10.131 --> 05:11.755
What curse?

05:11.756 --> 05:15.506
Yes, well as I understand it...

05:20.547 --> 05:23.631
We've inherited a house with a curse.

05:24.672 --> 05:27.421
I do not
intend to lose this house.

05:27.422 --> 05:28.256
How 'bout this one?

05:28.257 --> 05:29.713
There was a young girl from Hong Kong...

05:29.714 --> 05:31.921
Billy, say goodbye
to the nice truck driver.

05:31.922 --> 05:33.046
Bye.

05:34.547 --> 05:36.713
Oh, it's wonderful.

05:36.714 --> 05:38.213
It's a wonderful house.

05:41.214 --> 05:44.463
Mary, that's not the house.

05:50.214 --> 05:51.630
This is the house?

05:51.631 --> 05:53.005
You're gonna love it here.

05:53.006 --> 05:55.088
I feel it in my bones.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.089
Come on.

06:02.006 --> 06:04.339
It's what we call a fixer upper.

06:06.006 --> 06:07.922
It's what we call home.

06:12.089 --> 06:13.630
I'm sure they won't stay very long.

06:13.631 --> 06:15.213
I'm sure they won't.

06:15.214 --> 06:16.547
<i>I know they won't.</i>

06:20.547 --> 06:22.963
Oh, it even smells
like Uncle Henry's house.

06:22.964 --> 06:25.880
It's not going to
smell like this much longer.

06:25.881 --> 06:26.714
I'll be in college before

06:26.715 --> 06:28.131
we get rid of this smell.

06:29.881 --> 06:31.214
Turn on the lights.

06:34.297 --> 06:37.714
Maybe Uncle Henry
didn't pay his electric bill.

06:39.631 --> 06:41.755
I think this place is creepy.

06:41.756 --> 06:43.963
All it needs is a little cleaning up.

06:45.672 --> 06:46.672
Where's Rover?

06:47.756 --> 06:49.463
Rover, Rover?

06:49.464 --> 06:54.422
Come on, Boy.

06:55.006 --> 06:56.006
Rover?

06:59.172 --> 07:00.921
I wonder what got into Rover?

07:00.922 --> 07:02.380
It's this place.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.088
It's creepy.

07:04.089 --> 07:06.213
Billy, why don't you go
out and bring Rover in.

07:06.214 --> 07:07.214
Billy?

07:09.006 --> 07:10.006
Billy?

07:13.547 --> 07:14.588
Billy?

07:14.589 --> 07:15.589
"Billy?"

07:17.256 --> 07:18.963
Billy?

07:18.964 --> 07:20.172
Billy?

07:22.297 --> 07:23.546
He's probably just hiding.

07:23.547 --> 07:24.381
Remember when we went

07:24.382 --> 07:27.046
to Disneyland and he hid
inside Pluto for two hours?

07:31.131 --> 07:34.297
Billy, if you're
hiding inside a big dog again...

07:35.672 --> 07:37.546
I'm not staying here alone.

08:24.631 --> 08:25.631
What?

08:26.381 --> 08:28.463
This place is so creepy.

08:28.464 --> 08:29.796
<i>Who screamed? I heard a scream.</i>

08:29.797 --> 08:31.171
Where have you been?

08:31.172 --> 08:32.506
Fixing the fuse box.

08:35.672 --> 08:36.880
You guys don't wanna send me away

08:36.881 --> 08:39.087
to boarding school or something, do you?

08:39.089 --> 08:41.087
Everything will be just fine.

08:41.089 --> 08:43.630
You'd be amazed at what some nice curtains

08:43.631 --> 08:45.089
will do to this house.

08:48.006 --> 08:49.380
I'm just worried about what this house

08:49.381 --> 08:50.421
is gonna do to me.

08:53.464 --> 08:55.256
Hey, they haven't found it yet.

08:56.339 --> 08:58.671
You can't be too sure.

08:58.672 --> 09:03.171
I, I of all people, I can't be too sure?

09:03.172 --> 09:04.714
<i>Of course, I can be sure.</i>

09:05.756 --> 09:09.963
They haven't found it
because we have to find it.

09:09.964 --> 09:11.255
It started out

09:11.256 --> 09:13.338
to be an evening just like any other,

09:13.339 --> 09:15.088
but before it was over,

09:15.089 --> 09:17.505
Millison Hackshaw would find herself in...

09:17.506 --> 09:19.963
Was an innocent teenage girl.

09:19.964 --> 09:22.505
She had no idea that the terrible events

09:22.506 --> 09:23.630
building around her would plunge her...

09:23.631 --> 09:26.088
Is that what you call looking at the TV?

09:26.089 --> 09:27.796
I've tried every channel and all I get

09:27.797 --> 09:29.755
is The Twilight Zone.
Her father opened the door

09:29.756 --> 09:31.505
and stepped out...
Lightning always

09:31.506 --> 09:32.921
does that to the TV reception.

09:33.922 --> 09:34.839
A dimension of sight

09:34.840 --> 09:37.088
and sound and smell.

09:37.089 --> 09:38.588
A dimension of Oriental...

09:38.589 --> 09:40.130
It'll be alright once the storm is over.

09:40.131 --> 09:42.505
A dimension
of abandoned lumberyards.

09:42.506 --> 09:44.296
A dimension of railway stations

09:44.297 --> 09:48.796
that have stopped being grand
and are nowhere near central.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.338
There's a train leaving from that station,

09:51.339 --> 09:55.671
and it's destination is Cincinnati, Ohio.

10:01.547 --> 10:02.547
What storm?

10:24.797 --> 10:25.797
<i>“</i> Mary?
Mn'?

10:26.922 --> 10:28.172
Come here, look at this.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.547
It's some kind of a note.

10:37.256 --> 10:39.131
It's from Uncle Henry before he died.

10:40.464 --> 10:42.047
"Don't open the book."

10:43.297 --> 10:44.297
What book?

10:45.089 --> 10:46.089
He doesn't say.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.921
<i>I don't see any book.</i>

11:01.881 --> 11:02.921
Maybe it's a cookbook?

11:02.922 --> 11:06.005
Oh, why wouldn't he want
us to open a cookbook?

11:06.006 --> 11:07.755
Well, you know how I am

11:07.756 --> 11:10.171
about my apple turnover recipe.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.672
We're going to be very happy here.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.255
I'm so glad we're here

11:55.256 --> 11:57.421
in our very own house.

11:57.422 --> 11:59.588
Isn't it about time to go to bed?

11:59.589 --> 12:01.339
I got all the dishes to do.

12:04.006 --> 12:05.922
They'll still be here in the morning.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.421
Well, they've been here a whole day.

12:38.422 --> 12:40.588
They've gotta be ready to sell it by now.

12:47.464 --> 12:48.505
It wouldn't be nice

12:48.506 --> 12:50.755
to wake them,

12:50.756 --> 12:54.131
but, maybe somebody's up around the side.

13:02.339 --> 13:04.547
Maybe I'll come back later.

13:05.672 --> 13:07.255
Maybe not.

13:08.631 --> 13:10.338
Oh, no!

13:10.339 --> 13:13.921
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

13:18.339 --> 13:19.631
What was that?

13:20.881 --> 13:23.089
It must have been an owl.

13:28.464 --> 13:29.963
You're right.

13:29.964 --> 13:30.964
It was an owl.

14:05.089 --> 14:06.505
Damn owls.

14:10.131 --> 14:13.047
Oops.

14:21.297 --> 14:22.546
The monster was here.

14:22.547 --> 14:24.880
Calm down, you've just had a nightmare.

14:24.881 --> 14:26.380
Come on, everything's gonna be alright.

14:26.381 --> 14:28.255
- Except for the monster.
- Billy, Billy,

14:28.256 --> 14:30.046
there's no monster in here.

14:30.047 --> 14:32.505
There is, he's nine feet
tall, he has four arms,

14:32.506 --> 14:34.880
huge eyes on the top of
his head and huge teeth.

14:34.881 --> 14:36.171
Billy, act your age.

14:36.172 --> 14:37.255
<i>I am acting my age.</i>

14:37.256 --> 14:39.338
You're just used to me
acting line a grown up.

14:39.339 --> 14:40.256
I'm 10 years old,

14:40.257 --> 14:41.505
and there's a monster in here.

14:41.506 --> 14:44.171
Billy, there's no monster here.

14:44.172 --> 14:47.630
Look, do you see a monster in this room?

14:47.631 --> 14:49.171
I can't believe that I'm standing here

14:49.172 --> 14:51.671
in the middle of night
arguing with a 10 year old kid

14:51.672 --> 14:53.422
about the existence of monsters.

14:55.756 --> 14:57.713
Now just calm down and go to sleep,

14:57.714 --> 14:59.421
Everything will be fine in the morning.

14:59.422 --> 15:01.755
Except for me, I'll be a
faded memory in the morning.

15:01.756 --> 15:03.713
<i>I bet you were reading scary books again</i>

15:03.714 --> 15:05.796
before you went to bed.

15:05.797 --> 15:06.797
I...

15:12.547 --> 15:13.547
Goodnight.

15:15.756 --> 15:18.047
Sleep tight, don't
let the bed bugs bite.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.171
He had a nightmare.

15:25.172 --> 15:27.963
He thought there was
a monster in his room.

15:27.964 --> 15:29.630
I guess it's just spending

15:29.631 --> 15:31.963
the first night in a strange house.

15:31.964 --> 15:34.088
He'll be alright in the morning.

15:34.089 --> 15:36.422
Monsters.

15:41.339 --> 15:44.880
Mary?

15:44.881 --> 15:45.881
Mary?

15:49.756 --> 15:50.756
Mary?

15:51.506 --> 15:53.005
<i>I was good.</i>

15:53.006 --> 15:54.255
I didn't tell.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.630
Okay, I told.

15:57.631 --> 16:00.171
But he didn't believe me.

16:10.797 --> 16:11.797
Mary?

16:14.089 --> 16:15.089
Mary?

16:18.047 --> 16:19.047
Mary?

16:28.131 --> 16:29.713
Are you alright?

16:29.714 --> 16:30.756
Yeah, fine.

16:33.589 --> 16:34.589
Good.

16:36.131 --> 16:37.296
<i>“</i> Is Billy okay?

16:37.297 --> 16:39.130
Yeah, everything's fine.

16:59.547 --> 17:00.547
Wow.

17:32.172 --> 17:33.172
Damn owls.

17:59.256 --> 18:00.547
They found the book.

18:02.631 --> 18:03.756
It's not fair.

18:05.214 --> 18:09.213
For 300 years, I've been
searching for that book.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.671
Well, now you know where it is.

18:11.672 --> 18:13.630
That's not the point.

18:13.631 --> 18:14.838
Don't you understand?

18:14.839 --> 18:18.546
Whoever controls the
book, controls the world.

18:18.547 --> 18:19.922
And now he's got it.

18:21.631 --> 18:23.921
Two days from now there
may not be a world.

18:28.381 --> 18:31.131
Good morning.

18:38.256 --> 18:40.255
Thank you for doing the dishes last night.

18:40.256 --> 18:42.213
<i>I didn't do the dishes.</i>

18:42.214 --> 18:43.588
Oh?

18:43.589 --> 18:45.213
It must have been Debbie.

18:45.214 --> 18:47.838
Or maybe there are elves in the house.

18:47.839 --> 18:48.839
Elves.

18:56.214 --> 18:58.756
I guess they could have
used a little more sunlight.

19:06.089 --> 19:07.921
Oh, that's better, darling.

19:07.922 --> 19:10.380
They don't seem nearly as dead.

19:10.381 --> 19:12.130
Well, it may have been

19:12.131 --> 19:13.755
noisy last night, but this morning

19:13.756 --> 19:15.547
the house feels so comfortable.

19:20.756 --> 19:24.505
I don't think I slept
15 minutes all night.

19:24.506 --> 19:25.796
Billy woke us up.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.505
He had a nightmare.

19:27.506 --> 19:29.089
And we kept hearing owls.

19:30.922 --> 19:32.546
If you guys think I'm
starting school today

19:32.547 --> 19:34.130
in this condition, forget it.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.713
It'll be much quieter once
we get curtains on the windows.

19:37.714 --> 19:39.463
If you were so tired, you didn't have to

19:39.464 --> 19:41.713
get up early and do the dishes.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.755
<i>I didn't do the dishes.</i>

19:42.756 --> 19:45.339
- You didn't?
- Well then who did?

19:46.381 --> 19:48.755
It must have been Billy.

19:48.756 --> 19:51.380
Mom, when did you ever
know Billy to do a dish?

19:51.381 --> 19:52.755
Well, somebody did the dishes,

19:52.756 --> 19:54.755
and we're the only ones in this house.

20:01.256 --> 20:03.213
If he could get out of the book,

20:03.214 --> 20:06.131
there's gotta be a book to tell
you how to get them back in.

20:07.089 --> 20:09.297
There's something
creepy about this place.

20:11.381 --> 20:12.339
It was a neighborhood

20:12.340 --> 20:14.463
not unlike any other neighborhood,

20:14.464 --> 20:18.255
but this was a day unlike any other clay.

20:18.256 --> 20:19.838
We're going out to do some shopping.

20:19.839 --> 20:21.380
We're going to buy some curtains.

20:21.381 --> 20:24.380
Heavy curtains, this place
will be quiet as a tomb.

20:24.381 --> 20:26.255
Curtains and a few other things.

20:26.256 --> 20:29.381
It seems that one of
the windows was broken.

20:30.464 --> 20:33.047
Yeah, it must have
happened during my nightmare.

20:34.506 --> 20:35.796
We'll see you in a little while.

20:35.797 --> 20:37.255
Oh, Mom.

20:37.256 --> 20:39.713
You didn't clean up my room, did ya?

20:39.714 --> 20:41.256
I just put a few clothes away.

20:44.172 --> 20:46.505
Don't wreck the house while we're gone.

20:46.506 --> 20:49.838
See you later.

20:49.839 --> 20:50.880
Bye.

20:50.881 --> 20:52.796
We'll be back in a little while.

20:52.797 --> 20:56.046
Oh, my God, what a
bright, beautiful morning.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.171
Yes, it is a bright, beautiful morning,

20:58.172 --> 21:01.213
and we're in our own home.

21:01.214 --> 21:03.421
Yes, we are.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.713
Stanley had been before...

21:07.714 --> 21:08.589
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:08.589 --> 21:09.547
Anything the matter?
Oh, no.

21:09.548 --> 21:11.588
<i>I got to work, I forgot my badge,</i>

21:11.589 --> 21:13.213
<i>so I had to come and get it.</i>

21:13.214 --> 21:14.546
I couldn't sleep all night.

21:14.547 --> 21:15.588
<i>I kept hearing noises.</i>

21:15.589 --> 21:16.630
Take care.

21:16.631 --> 21:18.464
If you need anything, just scream.

21:20.339 --> 21:24.005
It' so reassuring to have
a policeman living next door.

22:19.464 --> 22:22.130
Billy, can you get that?

22:34.631 --> 22:35.464
Hello?

22:35.465 --> 22:37.130
This is the telephone company.

22:37.131 --> 22:39.380
You got me out of the
tub to tell me that?

22:39.381 --> 22:40.921
Your telephone is going to be

22:40.922 --> 22:43.213
out of service for the next hour.

22:43.214 --> 22:46.046
<i>Good, now maybe I can take my bath.</i>

22:46.047 --> 22:47.171
This is a recording.

22:50.922 --> 22:54.214
Hey, Billy, are you deaf or something?

23:00.297 --> 23:03.214
The next one who gets me out
of that tub is in big trouble.

24:30.297 --> 24:31.297
Help!

24:40.631 --> 24:41.631
Billy!

24:43.839 --> 24:44.839
Billy!

24:46.214 --> 24:47.214
Billy!

24:48.089 --> 24:50.005
Billy, there's a fish in the bathtub.

24:50.006 --> 24:52.213
There's a giant fish in the bathtub.

24:52.214 --> 24:53.214
What?

24:54.131 --> 24:55.131
Do something.

24:55.132 --> 24:57.755
You're supposed to be the
smart one in this family.

24:57.756 --> 24:59.046
Will you just do something?

24:59.047 --> 25:01.630
What do you want me to do, broil it?

25:07.006 --> 25:09.296
How big is this fish?

25:09.297 --> 25:10.297
<i>Big.</i>

25:18.297 --> 25:20.213
Do something.

25:20.214 --> 25:21.421
<i>I gotta get upstairs.</i>

25:21.422 --> 25:23.421
Ya gotta keep him busy.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.422
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

25:24.423 --> 25:26.213
Bring out the Monopoly set?

25:26.214 --> 25:27.296
Do something.

25:30.839 --> 25:33.421
<i>I need time to get up to my room, okay?</i>

25:33.422 --> 25:36.630
Oh.

25:36.631 --> 25:39.671
You've got to, just keep him away.

25:44.047 --> 25:45.463
Debbie, run.

25:45.464 --> 25:49.963
Get away.

25:55.464 --> 25:59.588
This is what you call
hanging up a few clothes?

25:59.589 --> 26:01.339
If she moved that book...

26:10.631 --> 26:12.213
I need the police, give me the police.

26:12.214 --> 26:14.046
<i>The Coast Guard, I need the Coast Guard.</i>

26:14.047 --> 26:15.047
I need help.

26:56.547 --> 26:58.130
Everything alright in there?

26:58.131 --> 27:00.005
No.

27:02.464 --> 27:03.921
Help!

27:07.756 --> 27:08.756
On my way.

27:09.881 --> 27:12.088
Hold it right there, man.

27:15.589 --> 27:19.005
Turn around, put your
hands against the wall.

27:19.006 --> 27:20.006
Help!

27:20.964 --> 27:21.881
Stop right there or

27:21.881 --> 27:22.756
I'll shoot.
No, no!

27:22.757 --> 27:24.546
No!

27:24.547 --> 27:25.671
<i>I don't want any</i>

27:25.672 --> 27:26.963
trouble with you.

27:38.339 --> 27:40.421
Kill him, what are you doing?

27:42.047 --> 27:43.047
Kill him!

28:07.631 --> 28:09.046
Debbie, wake up.

28:09.047 --> 28:09.881
You gotta help me find that book

28:09.882 --> 28:12.421
before Mom and Dad get back.

28:12.422 --> 28:15.630
If they find out that this
was my fault, come on.

28:15.631 --> 28:16.839
Debbie, wake up.

28:39.797 --> 28:41.671
There is another dimension

28:41.672 --> 28:43.130
for decent cheeseburgers,

28:43.131 --> 28:45.838
to a lost seven year old sits.

28:45.839 --> 28:49.963
Where the bluebird of happiness
still sings every morning.

28:49.964 --> 28:52.088
Where the decent people who live next door

28:52.089 --> 28:54.588
could be from another planet.

28:54.589 --> 28:56.338
Hi, we're back.

28:56.339 --> 28:57.838
How's everything?

28:57.839 --> 29:00.213
Oh, just fine, just fine.

29:00.214 --> 29:01.047
Where's Debbie?

29:01.048 --> 29:02.713
<i>I think she's taking a bath.</i>

29:02.714 --> 29:03.714
Ah.

29:13.922 --> 29:14.922
Debbie?

29:16.131 --> 29:17.380
Debbie?
No!

29:17.381 --> 29:19.505
It's me, it's your mother.

29:19.506 --> 29:20.672
Debbie, are you alright?

29:22.089 --> 29:23.506
I guess I fell asleep.

29:24.797 --> 29:27.381
<i>Oh, Mom, I had the creepiest dream.</i>

29:30.422 --> 29:33.505
Come on, come on.

29:33.506 --> 29:35.088
We can make a deal.

29:35.089 --> 29:36.255
What do you want?

29:36.256 --> 29:38.296
Hey, how about food?

29:38.297 --> 29:39.421
What do you like to eat?

29:41.381 --> 29:43.005
Bad question.

29:43.006 --> 29:44.255
This house is creepy.

29:44.256 --> 29:46.422
Ah, there's nothing
wrong with this house.

29:47.506 --> 29:50.671
Then how come all we get
on TV is The Twilight Zone?

29:50.672 --> 29:52.422
Some shows are very popular.

29:54.089 --> 29:56.046
I once watched television all morning

29:56.047 --> 29:58.463
and never say anything but I love Lucy.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.630
<i>Mom, this isn't I Love Lucy.</i>

30:00.631 --> 30:03.421
This is, there's a dimension of mind.

30:03.422 --> 30:05.880
Oh, that's just your imagination.

30:05.881 --> 30:08.588
You'll see, everybody
will love this house.

30:08.589 --> 30:09.880
Everybody?

30:09.881 --> 30:11.505
You're the only one who loves it.

30:11.506 --> 30:12.714
Everybody at the party.

30:13.797 --> 30:14.756
What party?

30:14.757 --> 30:15.921
Saturday night.

30:15.922 --> 30:17.505
The relatives insisted on coming over,

30:17.506 --> 30:19.921
so we had to invite somebody
we could stand, too.

30:19.922 --> 30:21.131
To balance things out.

30:22.256 --> 30:23.463
This Saturday night?

30:23.464 --> 30:24.464
The 13th.

30:25.714 --> 30:28.838
Mom, Friday's the 13th.

30:28.839 --> 30:29.880
The 14th then.

30:29.881 --> 30:31.338
Saturday the 14th.

30:45.839 --> 30:47.297
I've gotta find that book.

31:00.422 --> 31:04.463
Do this mean you want something to eat?

31:04.464 --> 31:05.838
No.

31:05.839 --> 31:07.588
Billy, you can't just
mope around like this.

31:07.589 --> 31:10.671
I won't be moping around much longer.

31:10.672 --> 31:11.839
I'm glad to hear that.

31:13.214 --> 31:16.089
You know, if you've got some problem...

31:18.506 --> 31:22.005
Well, if you lost something...

31:22.006 --> 31:22.839
"Yes?"

31:22.840 --> 31:25.630
If you lost something
and because you lost it

31:25.631 --> 31:28.547
the whole world was gonna be destroyed,

31:29.714 --> 31:31.588
what would you do?

31:31.589 --> 31:33.463
Are you telling me you lost something?

31:33.464 --> 31:34.880
Oh, hi, Deb, welcome home,

31:34.881 --> 31:36.547
you need some help?
Oh, thanks.

31:38.839 --> 31:41.296
Remember those people who
were trying to buy the house?

31:41.297 --> 31:42.421
Yes.

31:42.422 --> 31:43.588
Well, they were at the supermarket,

31:43.589 --> 31:47.130
and they asked me if we have
any antiques we wanted to sell,

31:47.131 --> 31:49.547
and also they wanted to
know about any old books.

31:50.714 --> 31:52.505
Boy are they creepy.

31:52.506 --> 31:54.463
You know, Dad, you really
ought to sell 'em the house.

31:54.464 --> 31:55.506
They'd fit right in.

31:58.964 --> 32:01.588
Debbie, what would you
do if you lost something

32:01.589 --> 32:04.880
and the world was going to be destroyed?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.796
I'd call the police.

32:06.797 --> 32:08.214
That wasn't the answer.

32:15.839 --> 32:17.296
<i>I wonder what Mom wanted this for?</i>

32:19.089 --> 32:21.171
She must be getting
into European cooking.

32:21.172 --> 32:23.130
Hmm.

32:23.131 --> 32:24.713
Where is she, anyway?

32:24.714 --> 32:26.505
What else, cleaning.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.172
Hello?

32:47.506 --> 32:49.131
Is anybody in there?

32:55.547 --> 32:56.547
Hello?

33:16.672 --> 33:17.797
You poor baby.

33:19.172 --> 33:22.463
How long have you been up here?

33:22.464 --> 33:24.296
Let's get you a bowl of milk.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.255
Come on, kitty, kitty, here.

33:30.256 --> 33:31.338
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty

33:31.339 --> 33:33.130
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

33:36.714 --> 33:38.963
That can't be mice.

33:38.964 --> 33:41.546
Not with a cat up here all this time.

33:45.506 --> 33:46.506
Kitty?

33:47.547 --> 33:48.547
Come on out.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.464
Puss?

33:53.672 --> 33:56.130
Puss, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss.

33:56.131 --> 33:57.589
Come on out, okay?

34:05.922 --> 34:08.088
God, look at all these owls.

34:11.422 --> 34:13.045
Hey, take it easy, huh?

34:16.505 --> 34:18.005
Stop it, owl.

34:18.005 --> 34:19.295
Ah, ah, ow.

35:10.047 --> 35:12.921
Go on, I won't
let them hurt you now.

35:12.922 --> 35:14.546
Go on, my darling.

35:14.547 --> 35:15.714
Take a little nap.

35:19.047 --> 35:22.505
Electric, electrolysis,
elevator, exercise,

35:22.506 --> 35:24.256
ah, there it is, exterminator.

35:25.297 --> 35:26.672
Who ate my sandwich?

35:27.797 --> 35:28.797
Not me.

35:30.172 --> 35:32.380
Me, yeah, yeah, it was me.

35:32.381 --> 35:34.213
<i>I thought you weren't hungry?</i>

35:34.214 --> 35:35.838
Well, you know, excitement.

35:35.839 --> 35:37.506
Excitement always makes ya hungry.

35:38.589 --> 35:40.296
Excitement, ah, exterminator.

35:40.297 --> 35:42.296
Ah, there's a good one.

35:42.297 --> 35:43.714
Major Pest Control.

35:59.089 --> 36:00.755
Major Pest Control.

36:00.756 --> 36:02.088
This is the Major speaking.

36:02.089 --> 36:03.130
My name is John Hyatt,

36:03.131 --> 36:04.963
and I've got bats in my belfry.

36:04.964 --> 36:06.171
I'm an exterminator.

36:06.172 --> 36:07.380
My belfry's full of bats.

36:07.381 --> 36:08.880
They just attacked my wife.

36:08.881 --> 36:10.255
Oh, you got bats in your belfry.

36:10.256 --> 36:12.046
- A lot of bats.
- Do you know how many?

36:12.047 --> 36:13.338
We charge by the bat.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.172
<i>I don't care what it costs</i>

36:14.173 --> 36:16.296
as long as we get the bats outta here.

36:16.297 --> 36:20.296
Yeah, okay, I'll send a man
over, say, ah, next Tuesday.

36:20.297 --> 36:23.130
No, right away, this minute.

36:23.131 --> 36:24.838
I'm at 329 Elm Street.

36:24.839 --> 36:26.172
Okay, I'll send him out.

36:28.672 --> 36:33.131
Van Helsing?

36:34.631 --> 36:36.213
Yeah?

36:36.214 --> 36:37.588
Bats.

36:37.589 --> 36:38.589
Bats!

36:39.964 --> 36:43.963
329 Elm Street.

36:43.964 --> 36:45.588
That sounds so hopeful.

36:45.589 --> 36:46.630
So inviting.

36:46.631 --> 36:48.630
So did 1827 Maple Street.

36:48.631 --> 36:51.963
So did 4386 Brentworst Drive.

36:51.964 --> 36:54.213
Sooner or later, my friend,

36:54.214 --> 36:56.130
I will find a house where the bats

36:56.131 --> 36:58.296
did not come in through the window.

36:58.297 --> 37:01.421
Sooner or later I'll be
able to end my searching.

37:01.422 --> 37:02.463
329 Elm Street,

37:02.464 --> 37:04.463
it doesn't sound like
the end of the rainbow.

37:04.464 --> 37:07.796
It's not that end of the
rainbow that I'm looking for.

37:14.422 --> 37:17.505
So, you're the man with
bats in his belfry, aye?

37:17.506 --> 37:19.213
You're the exterminator?

37:19.214 --> 37:20.421
- Yeah.
- You don't look

37:20.422 --> 37:21.505
like an exterminator.

37:21.506 --> 37:24.046
That's to fool the bats.

37:24.047 --> 37:25.672
Oh, what have we here?

37:27.047 --> 37:31.088
Nothing fires the imagination
so much as a fine library.

37:31.089 --> 37:35.880
Do you have any old
books, any very old books?

37:35.881 --> 37:37.130
Maybe you better ask Billy.

37:37.131 --> 37:38.463
He's the smart one in the family.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.713
No, no, no, old books.

37:40.714 --> 37:41.921
I always throw my old books away

37:41.922 --> 37:43.463
when I'm finished reading them.

37:43.464 --> 37:46.214
Old books can be worth
quite a lot of money.

37:48.256 --> 37:49.256
Take this to my room.

37:51.214 --> 37:52.463
Your room?

37:52.464 --> 37:55.505
Well, you don't expect me
to get rid of bats overnight.

37:55.506 --> 37:57.256
<i>I guess you can use the guestroom.</i>

38:00.756 --> 38:02.297
He is really creepy.

38:04.506 --> 38:08.755
Down at the exterminator
place, we have a little motto.

38:08.756 --> 38:10.546
When I leave this house,

38:10.547 --> 38:12.713
there will be nothing left here

38:12.714 --> 38:15.964
to be afraid of.

38:23.922 --> 38:25.922
Ah, this must be your charming wife.

38:27.506 --> 38:28.506
What's for dinner?

38:29.839 --> 38:32.338
<i>I think Mary bought a roast.</i>

38:32.339 --> 38:33.963
Debbie, why don't you start cooking

38:33.964 --> 38:36.838
while I show our guest to his room.

39:00.797 --> 39:03.046
You know, it sure gets dark
early since we've moved here.

39:03.047 --> 39:05.756
It's getting creepy.

39:07.422 --> 39:09.755
Are you still having nightmares?

39:09.756 --> 39:11.381
I don't even have to be asleep.

39:12.339 --> 39:14.380
Listen, we've gotta work on Mom and Dad

39:14.381 --> 39:16.255
to just sell this place and move.

39:16.256 --> 39:17.296
They can't sell it.

39:17.297 --> 39:19.421
It's part of Uncle Henry's will.

39:19.422 --> 39:20.506
They sell the place,

39:21.756 --> 39:23.213
the money goes back to the estate

39:23.214 --> 39:24.713
and all those vultures split it up.

39:24.714 --> 39:26.921
Oh, so we're stuck here?

39:26.922 --> 39:28.881
Not for long.

39:32.464 --> 39:35.589
Boy, even my own
brother's getting creepy.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.546
Dad!

40:19.172 --> 40:20.505
Just rest.

40:20.506 --> 40:22.088
It'll be alright.

40:22.089 --> 40:24.463
<i>I wonder...</i>

40:24.464 --> 40:25.464
What?

40:26.797 --> 40:29.006
<i>I wonder if I'm pregnant.</i>

40:30.964 --> 40:32.421
Help!

40:32.422 --> 40:33.755
The man next door...

40:33.756 --> 40:34.672
What's the matter?

40:34.673 --> 40:38.338
- No, it, it, it, it,
- What, what?

40:38.339 --> 40:40.255
- It's in the kitchen.
- The man next door

40:40.256 --> 40:41.838
is in the kitchen?

40:41.839 --> 40:43.714
<i>I wonder what he wants?</i>

40:51.506 --> 40:53.755
Well, whatever he wanted,
he must have found it.

40:53.756 --> 40:56.339
He probably just needed a
cup of sugar or something.

40:57.589 --> 40:58.589
But he was...

40:59.714 --> 41:00.714
He...

41:04.381 --> 41:05.671
It was an excellent meal.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.046
I could stay here forever.

41:09.422 --> 41:11.921
Darling, have a little piece.

41:11.922 --> 41:14.047
No, thank you very much.

41:15.172 --> 41:17.130
Sweetheart, have a taste.

41:17.131 --> 41:18.421
You'll love it.

41:18.422 --> 41:19.838
Debbie used a lotta garlic.

41:19.839 --> 41:21.755
No, no, garlic, keep it away!

41:22.881 --> 41:24.838
Thank you very much.

41:24.839 --> 41:26.963
Maybe we oughta get you

41:26.964 --> 41:28.630
some pickles and ice cream.

41:28.631 --> 41:31.505
You have been developing
strange eating habits

41:31.506 --> 41:32.464
since you've been here, yeah?

41:32.465 --> 41:35.296
No, no, that's just a little joke.

41:35.297 --> 41:36.671
You know, about being...

41:36.672 --> 41:39.172
- About being what?
- It's personal.

41:40.589 --> 41:42.546
About being pregnant.

41:42.547 --> 41:45.671
Oh, you're going to have a baby.

41:45.672 --> 41:46.880
Really, Mom?

41:46.881 --> 41:48.171
Really?

41:48.172 --> 41:49.380
Do you know who's baby it might be?

41:49.381 --> 41:51.796
I don't like that kinda talk.

41:51.797 --> 41:52.922
You remember Rosemary.

41:54.089 --> 41:55.297
She had a baby.

41:56.339 --> 41:59.421
<i>I don't even know
that I'm having a baby.</i>

41:59.422 --> 42:01.671
It may be just a...

42:01.672 --> 42:03.338
Just what?

42:03.339 --> 42:05.505
A strange feeling.

42:05.506 --> 42:08.089
And it started since
you came to live here.

42:09.422 --> 42:11.171
That book is in this house.

42:11.172 --> 42:12.588
Book, what book?

42:12.589 --> 42:13.713
What book?

42:13.714 --> 42:14.921
The book.

42:14.922 --> 42:16.755
Why do you think that
you have strange things

42:16.756 --> 42:17.921
happening to you?

42:17.922 --> 42:19.463
Why do you think you have bats?

42:19.464 --> 42:20.921
We have bats because of a book?

42:20.922 --> 42:22.463
You have more than bats.

42:22.464 --> 42:23.630
You have problems.

42:23.631 --> 42:25.296
If anything happens to that book,

42:25.297 --> 42:27.255
the whole world has problems.

42:27.256 --> 42:29.130
If someone should open that book,

42:29.131 --> 42:33.255
his soul will be doomed to
eternal hellfire and damnation.

42:33.256 --> 42:34.296
Hell!

42:34.297 --> 42:36.213
I've followed this book around the world

42:36.214 --> 42:37.588
for many, many years.

42:37.589 --> 42:39.921
More years than you would care to hear of.

42:39.922 --> 42:44.546
And now, at last, I know where it is.

42:44.547 --> 42:46.380
Where is it?
What?

42:46.381 --> 42:47.755
- What?
- What?

42:47.756 --> 42:48.756
It's gone.

42:49.964 --> 42:50.964
You had it?

42:53.172 --> 42:54.881
You didn't open it, did you?

42:57.214 --> 42:58.505
<i>Oh, boy'</i>

42:58.506 --> 42:59.464
I didn't know.

42:59.465 --> 43:01.713
Will someone please tell
me what this is all about?

43:01.714 --> 43:04.046
After all, I am the man of the house here.

43:04.047 --> 43:09.006
Your book of evil!

43:09.797 --> 43:10.797
Evil?

43:12.256 --> 43:13.338
Evil.

43:15.089 --> 43:17.631
All the
evil that there's ever been.

43:18.756 --> 43:19.963
In one book?

43:19.964 --> 43:23.088
Boy, a book like that would
be a bestseller for sure.

43:23.089 --> 43:27.046
All of that evil is
loose here in this house.

43:27.047 --> 43:30.505
Well, I guess it's
time to sell the house.

43:32.589 --> 43:34.255
Oh, yeah.

43:34.256 --> 43:37.630
Ah, you said you knew some
people who wanted to buy it.

43:37.631 --> 43:40.171
Let's give that nice
real estate lady a call.

43:40.172 --> 43:43.463
We are not going to sell this house.

43:43.464 --> 43:44.671
"But, Mom?"

43:44.672 --> 43:46.713
This is our home now.

43:46.714 --> 43:49.671
We, we belong here.

43:49.672 --> 43:51.213
Selling the house now

43:51.214 --> 43:53.380
would be like closing the barn door

43:53.381 --> 43:55.464
after the horses have eaten your children.

43:56.422 --> 43:58.088
So what are we supposed to do?

43:58.089 --> 44:00.921
Well, for one thing, we
better cancel that party.

44:00.922 --> 44:04.005
You're having a party here, now?

44:04.006 --> 44:06.338
We were having a few
people over tomorrow night.

44:06.339 --> 44:07.505
Tomorrow night?

44:07.506 --> 44:09.380
Saturday the 14th?

44:09.381 --> 44:10.381
Do you know what's gonna be

44:10.382 --> 44:11.838
waiting here for those people?

44:11.839 --> 44:13.755
Maybe we better just
let the relatives come.

44:13.756 --> 44:15.672
No, let everybody come.

44:16.672 --> 44:17.839
We can use those people.

44:18.797 --> 44:19.921
Their energy.

44:19.922 --> 44:21.713
And we will triumph.

44:21.714 --> 44:24.797
But I have a great deal of work
to do in the next 24 hours.

44:27.172 --> 44:29.422
And boy, find that book.

44:48.047 --> 44:49.630
Mary?

44:52.964 --> 44:53.964
Mary?

44:57.131 --> 44:59.172
Go where you hid the book

45:01.839 --> 45:03.381
and bring it to me.

45:06.214 --> 45:08.547
Bring me the book, my darling.

45:11.172 --> 45:12.172
Good.

45:14.339 --> 45:16.546
Bring me the book,

45:16.547 --> 45:18.339
and we'll fly off together.

45:21.047 --> 45:22.047
Yes.

45:26.297 --> 45:27.297
Yes.

45:33.047 --> 45:34.047
The book.

45:38.881 --> 45:40.381
Okay, go back to bed.

45:41.506 --> 45:43.005
I'll think of another way.

45:50.756 --> 45:53.546
Incantations for every occasion.

45:53.547 --> 45:55.839
Every occasion but finding that book.

46:00.047 --> 46:02.713
Turning bill collectors to stone.

46:02.714 --> 46:03.714
Day to day.

46:05.381 --> 46:07.714
He is in there and we're out here.

46:08.839 --> 46:12.505
He's got that book by now.

46:12.506 --> 46:14.213
If he had that book by now,

46:14.214 --> 46:15.963
he wouldn't still be in there.

46:15.964 --> 46:18.088
But we'd still be out here.

46:18.089 --> 46:20.713
- You could go in there.
- I could.

46:20.714 --> 46:21.756
You always do.

46:25.172 --> 46:27.381
You're starting to like
that woman, aren't you?

46:30.131 --> 46:32.130
She's not my type.

46:32.131 --> 46:34.671
She's hundred of years too young for me.

46:34.672 --> 46:37.630
I'd like to take a look at her neck.

46:37.631 --> 46:40.006
Honey, all I'm after is the book.

46:41.881 --> 46:43.963
Maybe I'll go in with you tonight.

46:43.964 --> 46:48.922
Well, if you don't trust me
after 311 years of marriage...

46:49.256 --> 46:51.796
312.

46:54.547 --> 46:56.505
We'll talk
about this when I get back.

46:56.506 --> 46:58.006
I'm going with you.

46:59.089 --> 47:00.546
<i>I wish I'd</i>

47:00.547 --> 47:01.838
never learned to do this.

47:01.839 --> 47:03.505
It's so unattractive.

47:03.506 --> 47:05.839
I'll get
that book if it kills us.

47:17.422 --> 47:18.713
It doesn't matter where we live,

47:18.714 --> 47:21.131
I've always got the longest
walk to the bathroom.

47:32.214 --> 47:34.214
This isn't the bathroom.

47:35.339 --> 47:36.797
This is the kitchen.

47:38.547 --> 47:40.047
What am I doing in the kitchen?

47:41.714 --> 47:43.171
What are they doing in the kitchen?

47:52.881 --> 47:55.380
<i>How am I gonna get out of the kitchen?</i>

49:51.881 --> 49:53.088
I'm trying to find that book,

49:53.089 --> 49:55.630
and all she can think about is
that hooker woman in London.

49:55.631 --> 49:58.130
That was a hundred years ago.

50:07.381 --> 50:08.214
Oops.

50:08.215 --> 50:10.547
Can't take you anywhere.

50:17.506 --> 50:21.671
If you weren't immortal,
you'd kill yourself.

50:21.672 --> 50:22.506
Oh, look.

50:22.507 --> 50:25.880
Isn't that that burglar
Larry from Budapest?

50:25.881 --> 50:28.546
No, that's a fruit bat
from the Philippines.

50:33.172 --> 50:34.380
I just hope this isn't going

50:34.381 --> 50:37.005
to be another little incident
like that hooker woman.

50:37.006 --> 50:39.130
That was a hundred years ago.

50:39.131 --> 50:41.546
I know, you're overdue.

50:51.589 --> 50:53.256
Oh, we meet again.

50:54.631 --> 50:57.088
I thought I settled your hash last time.

50:57.089 --> 50:58.963
I'm stronger now.

50:58.964 --> 51:01.296
I know how to deal with your kind.

51:01.297 --> 51:03.130
We were here first.

51:03.131 --> 51:05.546
I got inside the house first.

51:05.547 --> 51:07.005
We tried to buy it.

51:07.006 --> 51:09.296
But you didn't, now get out of my house.

51:09.297 --> 51:11.046
Not without the book.

51:11.047 --> 51:12.463
You will never get it.

51:12.464 --> 51:17.338
Do you know what one drop
of this will do to you?

51:17.339 --> 51:18.921
One drop?

51:18.922 --> 51:21.672
Darling, maybe we had better go.

51:24.339 --> 51:26.463
But we'll be back.

51:26.464 --> 51:28.756
And I'll be ready for you.

51:38.839 --> 51:41.422
Some vampires will believe anything.

51:46.089 --> 51:47.089
Not bad.

51:49.297 --> 51:51.672
Not good, but not bad.

51:57.756 --> 51:59.380
I think maybe it's time you all just

51:59.381 --> 52:00.671
got outta this house.

52:00.672 --> 52:03.213
You think it's that easy?

52:03.214 --> 52:04.963
You thinking you can just go waltzing

52:04.964 --> 52:06.171
through the front door,

52:06.172 --> 52:09.088
and all the evil in the
world will just politely fade

52:09.089 --> 52:10.464
into the woodwork, yeah?

52:11.547 --> 52:12.838
You want to leave?

52:12.839 --> 52:13.881
Go ahead, leave.

52:15.089 --> 52:16.380
Go on.

52:16.381 --> 52:17.422
Walk out the door.

52:18.381 --> 52:20.255
Walk out on your family.

52:20.256 --> 52:22.046
Forget your sister.

52:22.047 --> 52:24.296
Forget your responsibilities, go ahead.

52:24.297 --> 52:26.213
I've gotta get outta here.

52:26.214 --> 52:28.588
What is it your afraid of?

52:28.589 --> 52:29.714
Open the door.

52:35.547 --> 52:37.172
Have you had enough?

52:38.631 --> 52:41.256
Close it, it's freezing in here.

52:47.131 --> 52:50.213
You see?

52:50.214 --> 52:51.755
You can't leave.

52:51.756 --> 52:53.921
But I've gotta go to school Monday.

52:53.922 --> 52:56.171
By Monday, all of this will be over.

52:56.172 --> 52:59.588
It'll be over tomorrow night at the party.

52:59.589 --> 53:02.047
One way or the other.

53:13.172 --> 53:14.296
You know what this kitchen needs

53:14.297 --> 53:15.463
is some decoration.

53:15.464 --> 53:17.296
You could hang strings of garlic.

53:17.297 --> 53:18.256
Mary doesn't seem to be

53:18.257 --> 53:20.505
as fond of garlic as she used to.

53:20.506 --> 53:22.255
Garlic is very attractive

53:22.256 --> 53:23.464
in a kitchen this color.

53:29.131 --> 53:30.296
No, thank you.

53:30.297 --> 53:31.714
I never drink coffee.

53:33.631 --> 53:34.631
I'll take it.

53:35.297 --> 53:38.046
Without my first cup of
coffee in the morning,

53:38.047 --> 53:39.088
<i>I can't see straight.</i>

53:39.089 --> 53:41.838
We had a house once in Bavaria.

53:41.839 --> 53:43.630
We had so much garlic hanging,

53:43.631 --> 53:45.296
we couldn't find the stove.

53:45.297 --> 53:47.588
We couldn't even smell the stove.

53:47.589 --> 53:48.921
That kitchen made the cover

53:48.922 --> 53:50.755
of Better Homes and Garlic.

53:50.756 --> 53:53.381
Oh, I've gotta get outta here.

54:04.922 --> 54:07.505
There must be something we can do.

54:07.506 --> 54:09.921
- Oh, there is.
- What?

54:09.922 --> 54:13.171
Well you can, you can put
out big bowls of potato chips,

54:13.172 --> 54:15.338
and you can make a nice onion clip.

54:15.339 --> 54:17.171
Potato chips?

54:17.172 --> 54:18.131
Onion clip?

54:18.132 --> 54:19.963
Is that what monsters eat?

54:19.964 --> 54:22.588
No, that's what people eat.

54:22.589 --> 54:23.671
I'm not hungry.

54:23.672 --> 54:25.463
Well, you're having a party tonight.

54:25.464 --> 54:27.546
<i>Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.</i>

54:27.547 --> 54:29.255
You forgot about the party?

54:29.256 --> 54:31.921
The whole world is
depending upon this party.

54:31.922 --> 54:34.880
Now, we need onion dip, we need club soda,

54:34.881 --> 54:37.088
we need old Barbara Streisand records.

54:37.089 --> 54:38.255
The people at this party

54:38.256 --> 54:41.213
have to be as happy as
any people ever were.

54:41.214 --> 54:43.671
We need all the positive energy

54:43.672 --> 54:45.421
that we can get our hands on.

54:45.422 --> 54:47.213
Positive energy?

54:47.214 --> 54:50.546
We better call the relatives
and tell 'em not to come.

54:50.547 --> 54:51.464
Why don't you do it?

54:51.465 --> 54:53.713
I'm gonna check on your mother.

54:53.714 --> 54:55.588
Here, take this coffee.

54:55.589 --> 54:58.422
Huh, I can't stand the sight of it.

55:11.756 --> 55:14.171
<i>I think the circuits are busy.</i>

55:14.172 --> 55:18.255
Yeah, you know, it's cheaper
to call before eight o'clock.

55:18.256 --> 55:19.630
Circuits are probably just jammed

55:19.631 --> 55:21.839
with people trying to save 15 cents.

55:23.047 --> 55:24.463
Yeah, right.

55:24.464 --> 55:29.255
I'll call again after eight.

55:32.464 --> 55:33.922
Mary, are you alright?

55:37.172 --> 55:38.172
What's this?

55:41.089 --> 55:42.089
What's what?

55:43.214 --> 55:44.756
All this dirt?

55:45.797 --> 55:48.214
Your whole side of the
bed is covered with earth.

55:49.089 --> 55:53.213
I, I must have spilled a flower pot.

55:53.214 --> 55:55.213
Well, we'll have to get this cleaned up.

55:55.214 --> 55:57.964
No, no, thank you, I'll
clean it myself later.

55:59.047 --> 56:00.755
I have to get some sleep now.

56:02.922 --> 56:04.213
Give me a kiss, darling.

56:05.547 --> 56:07.839
Oh, let me just see who that is.

56:11.589 --> 56:13.089
I'll be back for that kiss.

56:23.172 --> 56:24.713
Yeah?
Hi, liquor store.

56:24.714 --> 56:26.672
No, private residence.

56:34.881 --> 56:35.839
- Yeah?
- No, no,

56:35.840 --> 56:37.630
I am from the liquor store.
Ah.

56:37.631 --> 56:38.921
- You called last night?
- Yeah.

56:38.922 --> 56:41.505
Potato chips, club soda,

56:41.506 --> 56:43.046
onion dip, Streisand records.

56:43.047 --> 56:44.506
Yeah, come in.

56:45.506 --> 56:47.130
Put it in the kitchen.

56:47.131 --> 56:48.047
I would help you with it,

56:48.048 --> 56:50.922
<i>but I, I hurt my back in Crimean War.</i>

57:10.256 --> 57:12.505
Maybe it'd be better
today if you played inside.

57:12.506 --> 57:14.255
I've gotta get out of this house.

57:14.256 --> 57:15.671
I'm a 10 year old kid.

57:15.672 --> 57:17.755
I'm supposed to be out in the sunshine.

57:17.756 --> 57:20.463
You'll never know the
contribution you've made

57:20.464 --> 57:21.839
for saving the world.

57:26.464 --> 57:27.464
Who's that guy?

57:31.006 --> 57:32.047
Have a nice day now?

57:41.797 --> 57:44.464
Boy, these storms come up all
of sudden this time of year.

57:46.172 --> 57:48.421
You folks mind if I wait it
out here for a few minutes?

58:03.172 --> 58:04.963
George and Elizabeth Benson

58:04.964 --> 58:06.964
get into their car to go to a party,

58:07.922 --> 58:08.963
but this wasn't going to be

58:08.964 --> 58:11.755
the kind of party they expected.

58:11.756 --> 58:13.255
The guest are about to arrive.

58:13.256 --> 58:15.880
Billy, will you turn that thing off?

58:15.881 --> 58:17.088
<i>- I did turn it off.
- The hors d'oeuvres</i>

58:17.089 --> 58:18.421
have been prepared in the...

58:27.131 --> 58:28.922
Oh, feed me.

58:30.131 --> 58:33.256
Young man, we're gonna have
dinner in just a few minutes.

58:43.006 --> 58:44.880
There are many ways

58:44.881 --> 58:46.213
of fighting evil.

58:46.214 --> 58:51.172
Huh, many ways.

59:06.881 --> 59:08.338
This could take hours.

59:08.339 --> 59:10.546
When are those people coming?

59:15.547 --> 59:17.421
I'll get it.

59:17.422 --> 59:20.046
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.

59:20.047 --> 59:21.671
- Uh-oh.
- Everybody always gets

59:21.672 --> 59:23.963
so excited about the first guests.

59:23.964 --> 59:26.381
But, Mom, there's
something horrible out there.

59:28.631 --> 59:31.422
Ah, you really are living here.

59:33.340 --> 59:35.964
You're right, there is
something horrible out there.

59:38.589 --> 59:40.463
Aunt Lucille.

59:40.464 --> 59:41.297
Uncle Bert.

59:41.298 --> 59:43.296
Here's a little
something from all of us.

59:43.297 --> 59:44.755
An electric can opener.

59:44.756 --> 59:46.171
Well, the place feels just the same

59:46.172 --> 59:47.755
as it did when Uncle Henry died of a...

59:49.547 --> 59:50.547
Mary.

59:51.797 --> 59:53.588
Mary quite contrary.

59:53.589 --> 59:55.296
Quite beautiful.

59:55.297 --> 59:57.130
Hey, John...

59:57.131 --> 59:58.256
Oh, sweetie.

59:59.381 --> 01:00:01.088
This place could
blow up any minute now.

01:00:01.089 --> 01:00:03.005
I could get you a disaster policy.

01:00:03.006 --> 01:00:04.963
- Would it go into effect now?
- Look how pale he is.

01:00:04.964 --> 01:00:07.713
Don't you ever let him out?
I'm gettin' 10%.

01:00:07.714 --> 01:00:10.422
- Oh, such a cutie.
- Hey, John...

01:00:12.214 --> 01:00:14.296
- Oh, my little cutie.
- Hi, there.

01:00:14.297 --> 01:00:17.838
I'm Phil, Johnny's cousin.

01:00:17.839 --> 01:00:19.255
- Want a drink?
- You call those

01:00:19.256 --> 01:00:20.089
hors d'oeuvres?

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:21.588
Yeah, I could go for something.

01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:22.796
<i>- What have they got?
- I don't know.</i>

01:00:22.797 --> 01:00:25.005
This one's got no meat on it.

01:00:25.006 --> 01:00:27.255
Which way is the bar?

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:29.421
What have we here?

01:00:29.422 --> 01:00:30.588
How long have they been here?

01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:32.069
- Bring on the food.
- Do bring it on.

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:34.796
Phil wanted to
sell me disaster insurance.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:37.005
- On this house?
- Disaster, what is it?

01:00:37.006 --> 01:00:40.296
That man deserves
everything that comes to him.

01:00:40.297 --> 01:00:41.588
I thought you were
going to use these people

01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:43.088
to get rid of the monsters?

01:00:43.089 --> 01:00:45.171
- I am.
- Aunt Lucille,

01:00:45.172 --> 01:00:47.171
let me take you coat.

01:00:47.172 --> 01:00:48.006
Oh, no, no, dear.

01:00:48.007 --> 01:00:49.880
I'll hang it up myself.

01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:52.006
Otherwise, how could I
look in your closets?

01:00:55.922 --> 01:00:57.506
Who is that kid on the sofa?

01:01:00.964 --> 01:01:02.755
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:01:02.756 --> 01:01:05.297
Terrible place, I
would never live in here.

01:01:06.506 --> 01:01:10.421
Oh, God.

01:01:10.422 --> 01:01:12.463
Ah, there's the closet.

01:01:12.464 --> 01:01:14.880
Let's see who's skeleton is in it.

01:01:24.297 --> 01:01:26.172
Well, the nerve of her.

01:01:27.922 --> 01:01:29.381
Buying a coat just like mine.

01:01:51.381 --> 01:01:52.463
Hello?

01:01:52.464 --> 01:01:55.796
Hi, I'm Annette
Muldowney from next door.

01:01:55.797 --> 01:01:57.046
I hated to come alone,

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.088
but I haven't seen my husband in two days.

01:02:00.089 --> 01:02:01.921
Well, he's a policeman.

01:02:01.922 --> 01:02:04.505
He's probably working overtime.

01:02:04.506 --> 01:02:06.630
The crime is so terrible these days.

01:02:06.631 --> 01:02:08.963
They've been getting
killed everywhere you look.

01:02:08.964 --> 01:02:10.505
Well, I'm glad
one of you could make it.

01:02:10.506 --> 01:02:11.713
Come on.

01:02:11.714 --> 01:02:13.880
I brought you a little something.

01:02:13.881 --> 01:02:15.380
It's an electric can opener.

01:02:15.381 --> 01:02:16.838
It's exactly what I needed.

01:02:16.839 --> 01:02:18.296
- Oh.
- Thank you.

01:02:18.297 --> 01:02:19.713
I'll see if we can use it at the bar.

01:02:19.714 --> 01:02:20.714
Come in.

01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:26.297
Banana daiquiri.

01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:28.881
Banana daiquiri.

01:02:31.756 --> 01:02:36.463
The world is coming to end and
they make me the bartender.

01:02:36.464 --> 01:02:39.713
<i>Ah, I haven't mixed a drink</i>

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:41.588
since that time Attila the Hun

01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:43.089
got drunk and wrecked Mongolia.

01:02:51.672 --> 01:02:53.631
Anyone had the banana daiquiri?

01:02:54.839 --> 01:02:57.547
Ah, Mary, have you seen Lucille?

01:02:58.797 --> 01:02:59.964
Not since she went to,

01:03:01.047 --> 01:03:02.547
to hang up her coat.

01:03:03.464 --> 01:03:06.006
<i>I can't find her hiding ever.</i>

01:03:07.506 --> 01:03:09.756
How does your garden grow?

01:03:10.631 --> 01:03:13.588
You have to find somebody
else to be bartender.

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:15.088
<i>I brought you this can opener.</i>

01:03:15.089 --> 01:03:16.630
That'll make it easier.

01:03:16.631 --> 01:03:17.921
<i>I have things to do.</i>

01:03:17.922 --> 01:03:20.380
People are already disappearing.

01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:21.588
Where's Billy?

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:23.338
I need him for this.

01:03:23.339 --> 01:03:24.339
He's right...

01:03:26.172 --> 01:03:27.338
I'll find him.

01:03:27.339 --> 01:03:29.463
If anything has happened to that boy,

01:03:29.464 --> 01:03:31.089
we'll be sunk.

01:03:32.172 --> 01:03:35.588
Mary?

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:36.630
Have you seen Billy?

01:03:36.631 --> 01:03:40.005
Mary, this ice is so old.

01:03:40.006 --> 01:03:41.255
Have you seen Billy?

01:03:41.256 --> 01:03:42.880
Yeah, he's ri...

01:03:42.881 --> 01:03:45.005
Oh, he must have gone upstairs.

01:03:45.006 --> 01:03:47.421
You know how kids hate grownup parties.

01:03:47.422 --> 01:03:48.422
Debbie?

01:03:50.214 --> 01:03:51.047
Have you seen Billy?

01:03:51.048 --> 01:03:53.588
Find him.

01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:55.213
Okay.

01:03:55.214 --> 01:03:56.214
Debbie?

01:03:58.381 --> 01:04:00.338
Who's that guy?

01:04:00.339 --> 01:04:01.506
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.796
You haven't found the boy yet?

01:04:05.797 --> 01:04:07.338
We haven't even looked yet.

01:04:07.339 --> 01:04:09.713
Well look, look high and low.

01:04:09.714 --> 01:04:11.630
It's almost 11:30.

01:04:11.631 --> 01:04:13.963
If we don't have that boy by midnight,

01:04:13.964 --> 01:04:18.505
things are going to get
extraordinarily unpleasant.

01:04:18.506 --> 01:04:19.506
People.

01:04:21.006 --> 01:04:22.006
Everybody.

01:04:23.006 --> 01:04:25.005
<i>I have an announcement to make.</i>

01:04:25.006 --> 01:04:27.630
We're going to play a little game.

01:04:27.631 --> 01:04:31.838
Somewhere in this house
is hidden a small boy.

01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:34.005
Let's see who is the first to find him.

01:04:34.006 --> 01:04:35.505
What do we win?

01:04:35.506 --> 01:04:37.546
You win, win, what do you win?

01:04:37.547 --> 01:04:39.713
Oh, you, you get to keep the boy.

01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:42.796
- No.
- Ah, no, no.

01:04:42.797 --> 01:04:46.796
Ah, you, you, ah, you get
an electric can opener.

01:04:46.797 --> 01:04:47.756
- Good
- Oh.

01:04:47.756 --> 01:04:48.756
Alright.

01:04:58.172 --> 01:05:03.131
Billy?

01:05:11.172 --> 01:05:12.172
"Billy?"

01:05:14.256 --> 01:05:15.838
Billy?

01:05:15.839 --> 01:05:16.839
"Billy?"

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:27.922
The book, it's gone.

01:05:29.422 --> 01:05:33.964
Beryourhomen, grainen, consacrat.

01:05:47.214 --> 01:05:48.214
"Billy?"

01:05:49.047 --> 01:05:50.630
Billy?

01:05:50.631 --> 01:05:54.547
Are you here?

01:06:03.172 --> 01:06:04.172
"Billy?"

01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:13.589
Billy?

01:06:18.631 --> 01:06:20.630
Now this worked
on that other little boy.

01:06:20.631 --> 01:06:23.380
How the hell did it go?

01:06:23.381 --> 01:06:24.921
You look here,

01:06:24.922 --> 01:06:26.296
I'll go in here.

01:06:26.297 --> 01:06:28.130
Holler if you see anything.

01:06:28.131 --> 01:06:29.131
Right.

01:06:33.131 --> 01:06:34.131
Billy?

01:06:36.172 --> 01:06:37.172
Billy?

01:06:38.047 --> 01:06:38.881
My, God.
It's what

01:06:38.882 --> 01:06:42.047
we call a fixer upper.

01:06:47.256 --> 01:06:48.089
Oh.

01:06:48.089 --> 01:06:49.089
"Billy?"

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:53.380
Find your own place to look for him.

01:06:53.381 --> 01:06:55.005
I think it's real...

01:06:57.631 --> 01:07:00.463
You haven't seen the little boy, have you?

01:07:06.797 --> 01:07:08.338
Ernie.

01:07:08.339 --> 01:07:12.421
Oh, thank God you're here.

01:07:12.422 --> 01:07:14.463
Ernie, do something.

01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:15.464
Oh.

01:07:17.547 --> 01:07:18.547
Oh, oh, oh.

01:07:24.631 --> 01:07:25.506
Bill?

01:07:25.507 --> 01:07:27.339
Bill, will you answer me?

01:07:33.881 --> 01:07:35.421
Oh, thanks.

01:07:35.422 --> 01:07:36.756
I almost broke my neck.

01:07:45.339 --> 01:07:47.880
- You found him?
- We looked everywhere.

01:07:47.881 --> 01:07:51.463
In one minute, terrible
things are going to happen.

01:07:53.297 --> 01:07:54.297
Less than a minute.

01:07:56.214 --> 01:07:57.963
The monsters are taking over the house.

01:07:57.964 --> 01:08:00.088
We're all doomed.

01:08:00.089 --> 01:08:01.380
Doomed!

01:08:14.131 --> 01:08:15.588
Who could that be?

01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:17.921
Everybody I'd invited
has already shown up.

01:08:17.921 --> 01:08:19.880
- And left, I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

01:08:19.881 --> 01:08:21.001
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

01:08:30.796 --> 01:08:34.046
I believe this what you've
been looking for, Van Helsing.

01:08:36.756 --> 01:08:40.130
- Billy.
- Stop, don't touch that boy.

01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:41.505
Give me that book.

01:08:41.506 --> 01:08:42.962
Not so fast.

01:08:42.964 --> 01:08:45.671
We have no time to lose.

01:08:47.421 --> 01:08:52.381
Billy, my boy, will you
kindly hand me that book?

01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:54.962
Give him the book, Billy.

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:57.337
He's the only one who can
get rid of the monsters.

01:08:57.339 --> 01:08:58.214
He is the monster.

01:08:58.215 --> 01:08:59.712
Give me the book.

01:08:59.714 --> 01:09:00.671
<i>I know who you are.</i>

01:09:00.671 --> 01:09:01.631
You're in this book.

01:09:01.631 --> 01:09:03.005
They showed me.

01:09:03.006 --> 01:09:05.630
<i>I can make you very strong.</i>

01:09:05.631 --> 01:09:06.671
Never.

01:09:17.589 --> 01:09:19.464
Come on, Billy, quit fooling around.

01:09:21.046 --> 01:09:23.546
Your powers are
nothing compared to mine.

01:09:23.546 --> 01:09:27.130
When I get that book,
I will rule the world.

01:09:27.131 --> 01:09:28.630
Think of it.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:31.505
Famine, war, death!

01:09:31.506 --> 01:09:32.339
Those we've got.

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:35.131
And you will be the first to die.

01:10:15.214 --> 01:10:16.880
No one will stop me.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:19.671
I never liked that lamp.

01:10:23.047 --> 01:10:24.338
Why, that was your mother's table.

01:10:24.339 --> 01:10:25.339
Was it?

01:10:30.131 --> 01:10:31.131
Mm-yeah.

01:10:31.964 --> 01:10:33.880
Na, na, na, na, na.

01:10:51.964 --> 01:10:53.796
The fireplace, it's burning.

01:11:21.506 --> 01:11:23.546
<i>I am your master.</i>

01:11:23.547 --> 01:11:26.338
Once the book is destroyed,

01:11:26.339 --> 01:11:29.546
you will never be imprisoned again.

01:11:29.547 --> 01:11:33.130
The army of night will rule the world.

01:11:33.131 --> 01:11:35.214
It can't get any creepier than this.

01:11:49.922 --> 01:11:51.131
Help me, please

01:11:52.047 --> 01:11:54.546
I know, nobody's gonna be fine.

01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:12.796
Let go of this book, boy.

01:12:12.797 --> 01:12:14.213
It killed the monsters,

01:12:14.214 --> 01:12:15.463
and it'll kill you.

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:18.422
Nothing can kill Me.

01:12:25.381 --> 01:12:28.672
No, no!

01:12:30.006 --> 01:12:31.381
We won, we won.

01:12:50.172 --> 01:12:53.046
It's Rover, Rover's back.

01:12:58.672 --> 01:13:02.046
He thought destroying the
book would free the monsters.

01:13:06.881 --> 01:13:09.921
That wasn't the way it worked.

01:13:09.922 --> 01:13:11.797
Thank you for coming.

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.589
Thank you.

01:13:22.672 --> 01:13:26.589
I had a, um, a, um, swell party.

01:13:28.339 --> 01:13:29.713
Have a nice clay.

01:13:29.714 --> 01:13:30.714
You too.

01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:34.338
We don't know who he is.

01:13:34.339 --> 01:13:35.838
Well, at least he's gone.

01:13:36.757 --> 01:13:38.171
Come here, boy.

01:13:38.172 --> 01:13:39.546
Good boy, Rover.

01:13:39.547 --> 01:13:40.671
Good boy.

01:13:40.672 --> 01:13:43.088
I think they've
had enough of this house.

01:13:43.089 --> 01:13:44.588
I think so, too.

01:13:44.589 --> 01:13:47.256
It's time they
lived happily ever after.

01:13:49.214 --> 01:13:50.547
And us, too?

01:13:51.464 --> 01:13:54.089
Of course, darling.
