WEBVTT

00:06.464 --> 00:08.091
[motorcycle approaching]

00:09.842 --> 00:11.178
-Hey!
-Hey.

00:11.969 --> 00:14.597
Oh, shit! Look at that black eye.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.891
Is that from some kinky post-proposal sex?

00:19.519 --> 00:20.812
'Cause I get that. [sighs]

00:20.895 --> 00:24.191
Last Valentine's, I gave Mary
some flowers and chocolates.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.859
She gave me some
choke marks and rope burns.

00:29.612 --> 00:33.283
No, Thomas Rhett sucker-punched me
when I got on stage to propose.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.243
-You fucking kidding me?
-[scoffs]

00:35.327 --> 00:36.744
-A celebrity punched you in the face?
-Yeah.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.330
I've never been more
proud of you in my life.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.540
I know, right? [chuckles]

00:40.623 --> 00:42.875
Up until then, the most famous person
to ever punch me

00:42.959 --> 00:44.752
was the Captain Morgan pirate.

00:44.836 --> 00:49.132
Don't give me a bottle of rum
and expect me not to twist your mustache.

00:50.425 --> 00:53.052
-Hey, you tell Mom and Dad?
-Yeah, I told Dad.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.638
He said, "Congratulations.
So that's why you're fucking late?"

00:56.764 --> 01:00.477
Told Mom. She's real psyched about
having Abby as part of the family.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.019
She started to cry.

01:02.104 --> 01:03.688
Although, she was at a protest,

01:03.771 --> 01:06.233
so I don't know if it was
from the news or the tear gas.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.070
You tell Abby's parents?

01:10.153 --> 01:11.988
Yeah. They cried too.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.992
And swore. A lot.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.287
But it's okay.
I'm gonna invite 'em over for dinner.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.414
Make 'em Grandma Bennett's apple crumble.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.167
Dude, Grandma Bennett didn't cook.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.628
The only thing she ever made
was Aunt Lucy a stripper.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.674
So, that's why she always
put singles in our birthday cards.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.221
Shit, who's that woman out there with Dad?

01:36.304 --> 01:37.430
Oh, dibs.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.392
[stutters] Okay, first of all,
you're with Mary.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.019
Second of all,
you can't call dibs on a person.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.272
She's not the last PBR.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.274
By the way,
this is the last PBR. Dibs.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.530
-[Rooster] Hey.
-Hi! [chuckles]

01:53.613 --> 01:55.615
Boys, this is Jen Parnell.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.950
These are my sons, Colt and Rooster.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.786
Nice to meet you guys.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.371
I'd like to say I heard good things,

02:01.454 --> 02:03.498
but I just spent the last hour
with your dad.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.920
Jen's an engineer
with Rocky Mountain Natural Gas.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.756
Oh, engineer, huh?
Well, you must be smart and shit.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.219
I am. I went to the University of Wyoming.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.431
-I majored in smart and minored in shit.
-[Beau chuckles]

02:20.515 --> 02:24.269
Yeah. Wyoming recruited me
pretty hard for football

02:24.352 --> 02:26.813
-but I don't look good in brown.
-Mmm.

02:28.022 --> 02:30.442
My skin's more of a spring-summer palette.

02:31.859 --> 02:37.449
Okay, well, I have to get going
but I will leave you with this.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.910
If you have any questions,
the best way to get in touch is e-mail.

02:40.993 --> 02:42.412
What's the second-best way?

02:44.206 --> 02:45.873
-My number's on the card.
-Ah.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.167
It was great to meet you, Beau.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.086
You too. Goodbye.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.591
[door opens]

02:54.674 --> 02:56.676
-[door closes]
-Holy shit.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.679
I've never seen anybody
go out the front door.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.057
I forgot that thing was there.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.811
I know.
She was knocking out there forever.

03:06.894 --> 03:09.272
I thought it was a fucking woodpecker.
[chuckles]

03:10.982 --> 03:12.191
What'd she want?

03:12.275 --> 03:14.236
Gas company's building a pipeline.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.821
They want to put it through our land.

03:16.904 --> 03:19.491
And you let her in?
Come on, Dad, you hate solicitors.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.284
You won't even sign for a UPS package.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.287
Grown men shouldn't wear shorts.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.000
I told her we might be interested.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.835
-Really?
-Are you serious?

03:30.918 --> 03:33.045
Man, you're getting soft in your old age.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.757
I wanted to put up a windmill,
you hit me with a shovel.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.428
Yeah, they're offering a lot of money,
but I'm torn.

03:41.095 --> 03:45.267
Goes against everything I know and feel
about being a steward of the land.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.310
I mean, Dad, this is a shit ton of money.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.562
Would be nice to have
a little safety net, you know?

03:49.646 --> 03:52.607
Not have to throw them bills away
and pretend we never got 'em.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.442
Yeah, maybe.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.861
My old man would be
rolling over in his grave.

03:56.944 --> 03:57.987
I don't know.

03:58.070 --> 04:00.407
I think if Grandpa Bennett was here,
he'd want us to take the money

04:00.490 --> 04:04.035
and pass this place down
to future generations of Bennetts.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.788
Uh, plus, he'd want us
to spend some of that money

04:06.871 --> 04:09.249
to buy a couple of sweet-ass Jet Skis.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.253
We're not getting
fucking Jet Skis, you idiot.

04:14.003 --> 04:17.965
This is natural gas money, all right?
We're getting a big-ass pontoon boat.

04:18.049 --> 04:21.052
[laughs] Hell yeah.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.595
This will really help.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.181
I mean, God is throwing us a bone.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.309
We need to bury that fucker
20 feet in the ground

04:27.392 --> 04:29.269
and pump natural gas through it.

04:31.354 --> 04:35.525
I don't know. I've never said this to you
boys before, but maybe you're right.

04:35.608 --> 04:36.734
Hell yeah!

04:38.861 --> 04:42.574
First thing I gotta do is go talk
to Sam Peterson and get his okay.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.908
Why?

04:43.991 --> 04:46.411
The gas company has to cross his land

04:46.494 --> 04:48.913
in order to get to where
they wanna put the pipeline.

04:51.833 --> 04:52.875
[door closes]

04:52.959 --> 04:55.545
Well, Peterson's not gonna agree to that.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.922
-Bye-bye, Jet Skis.
-Yeah.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.300
Bye-bye, pontoon boat.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.304
Bye-bye, electric bill. [chuckles]

05:06.514 --> 05:08.516
[theme song playing]

06:12.414 --> 06:14.541
-Hey, Rooster.
-Hey, Hank.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.793
Sorry, man, I can't give you a beer today.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.294
That's not funny.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.338
Look, I can't serve till I talk to Jerry.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.759
-But you're drinking.
-Yeah, I work here.

06:24.842 --> 06:25.885
Right.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.095
Can I work here?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.517
Hey, Rooster.

06:33.350 --> 06:34.477
Guy who's always here.

06:36.103 --> 06:38.940
Jerry, let's talk. All right, listen.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.150
If anybody asks,
you found that in the alley.

06:41.233 --> 06:44.070
[chuckles] Any chance I found
some onion rings out there too?

06:47.406 --> 06:49.325
-Hey. What's the deal, man?
-Hey, how are you?

06:49.408 --> 06:50.452
Did you, uh, did you talk
to the liquor board?

06:50.535 --> 06:54.080
-Yeah, I did. And you got two options.
-[sighs]

06:54.163 --> 06:56.749
You can either pay a $1,000 fine

06:56.833 --> 06:58.835
or you can shut down
the bar for three days.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.587
Well, I don't got a thousand bucks.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.380
Okay, then you have one option.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.760
No, I can't shut down either, okay?
I'm barely breaking even.

07:07.844 --> 07:11.138
Last month, I almost called Immigration
so I don't have to pay Emilio.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.101
Look, Rooster, I know this
isn't what you wanna hear,

07:15.184 --> 07:18.062
but it's just a standard penalty
for a first offense.

07:18.145 --> 07:20.565
No, Jerry, this is bullshit, okay?

07:20.648 --> 07:23.610
They sent in a hot, underage chick
to come flirt with me and buy a beer.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.612
-That is classic entrapment.
-I get it.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.073
You know, I went to this Phish concert

07:29.156 --> 07:31.868
and this hippie chick
asked me if I had any acid.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.829
So, I unzipped my fanny pack...

07:35.872 --> 07:39.375
and the next thing I know
is that I'm handcuffed,

07:39.459 --> 07:40.710
face down in the mud.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.378
[breathing heavily]

07:42.462 --> 07:44.547
Which, you know, when you're high...

07:44.631 --> 07:46.799
feels amazing.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.473
Look... [sighs] can we, like,
fight this in court, or...

07:53.556 --> 07:55.266
Oh, you could, yeah.

07:55.349 --> 07:58.936
But even if you win,
it's gonna cost you even more. [laughs]

08:00.271 --> 08:01.898
Fucking lawyers, huh?

08:04.316 --> 08:05.527
[sighs]

08:07.570 --> 08:08.863
All right, fine, I'll shut down.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.948
Okay. I'm sorry, Rooster.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.199
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.952
-Thanks, Jerry. Thanks for coming.
-You bet.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.039
I mean, what the fuck, Hank?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.502
I found it in the alley.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.345
Hey, Sam.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.017
Sneaking up on a man on his own property
is a good way to get shot.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.561
Unless that man is you,

08:39.644 --> 08:42.063
then it's a good way
to get missed by 30 yards.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.817
What you doing here, Beau?

08:46.526 --> 08:48.152
Well, I was hoping we could talk.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.657
Well, I was hoping to get drunk.
How 'bout we do both?

08:55.577 --> 08:57.494
Colt told me about your condition.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.206
Real sorry to hear it.

09:01.248 --> 09:02.249
My condition?

09:03.668 --> 09:07.338
[chuckles] You're talking about
my inoperable brain tumor.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.050
But "condition," that's cute.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.432
Jesus Christ. I think I found the cause.

09:19.475 --> 09:20.810
-Yeah.
-[grunts]

09:20.893 --> 09:22.854
Well, now this is the treatment.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.067
I see you finally built
yourself a smokehouse.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.777
[grunts] Yeah.

09:29.861 --> 09:32.071
Smoking some rabbits
over mesquite right now.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.365
So...

09:35.491 --> 09:37.284
we done with the fucking small talk?

09:39.161 --> 09:42.206
Rocky Mountain Natural Gas
came by my place today.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.084
They wanna put a pipeline across my land.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.756
A pipeline across your land and not mine.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.592
Well, that answers one big question.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.343
There is no fucking God.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.221
In order to put it in,

09:57.304 --> 10:00.516
they'd have to cut an access road
across your southeast corner.

10:01.684 --> 10:05.730
Well... maybe there is a God.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.109
There's money in it for you too.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.361
Maybe then you could buy yourself
a seeing eye dog

10:12.444 --> 10:14.155
for when this shit makes you go blind.

10:16.573 --> 10:18.492
This could be a good deal for both of us.

10:18.575 --> 10:21.120
If I want smoke blown up my ass,

10:21.203 --> 10:24.206
I'll go spread my cheeks
over those 30 rabbits in that shed.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.126
Why should I do you any favors?

10:27.209 --> 10:29.045
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause we're neighbors.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.880
Oh, we're neighbors, huh?

10:31.714 --> 10:33.132
Well, that's news to me.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.635
Seems to me a neighbor
would have been there

10:35.718 --> 10:38.429
when the blizzard of '94 took out my barn.

10:38.512 --> 10:41.598
Please, that barn was a piece of shit.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.268
And if the blizzard of '94 didn't get it,

10:44.351 --> 10:47.146
it would've come down
in the light breeze of '95.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.860
Where in the hell were you when I got
so hard up I had to turn my power off?

10:52.944 --> 10:55.362
Sitting in my well-lit living room,

10:55.446 --> 10:57.824
watching  Wheel of Fortune
and laughing at your ass.

10:58.615 --> 11:01.661
-Where were you when Estelle got sick?
-Where were you when Maggie left?

11:01.744 --> 11:03.830
I'll tell you where I wasn't.

11:04.538 --> 11:07.083
I wasn't in my damn deer stand
'cause you tore it down.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.461
There it is. It always comes back
to that fucking deer stand.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.797
I tore it down
'cause it was on my property.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.048
When are you gonna get over that?

11:14.131 --> 11:16.258
When you admit that it was on my property!

11:16.342 --> 11:18.803
You're gonna be waiting
for the rest of your life for that.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.764
Well, then, thank God
I ain't got much time left.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.558
Yeah. Finally something we can agree on.

11:32.274 --> 11:35.361
Oh, hey, I know your, uh, parents
are snobby about cheese,

11:35.444 --> 11:37.488
so I put out the orange and the yellow.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.615
They're not coming.

11:39.698 --> 11:40.825
-What?
-Yeah.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.744
Apparently, my dad refused.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.872
Says he's not gonna fake being happy
while I "throw my life away."

11:47.206 --> 11:48.958
-Shit.
-[sighs]

11:49.041 --> 11:51.585
You know, I thought we'd moved past
the phase where your dad hates me

11:51.668 --> 11:53.629
and moved into the phase
where he pretends to like me.

11:54.546 --> 11:57.591
I don't want him to fucking pretend,
all right? This is bullshit.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.303
Look, he's just being
protective of his daughter.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.016
He sees me as the guy
who flunked out of college,

12:05.099 --> 12:08.102
threw away his football career,
knocked up some girl.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.023
I hope our daughter
has better taste than you.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.027
Don't defend him, all right?
And I have great taste.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.070
Look at these throw pillows.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.198
Ab, you're new to this whole

12:21.282 --> 12:23.951
"my dad being disappointed
with my life decisions" thing.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.079
You know who else's dad used to hate me?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.916
-Yours?
-That's right.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.375
-[clicks tongue]
-But this year...

12:32.043 --> 12:35.337
-he got me a card on my birthday.
-[sighs] Hmm.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.424
And it said, "Love, Dad."

12:38.507 --> 12:39.550
[chuckles softly]

12:39.633 --> 12:40.843
And granted, he sent it through the mail

12:40.927 --> 12:42.178
'cause he didn't wanna
hand it to me in person,

12:42.261 --> 12:43.846
but, I mean, still, that's huge.

12:45.681 --> 12:46.891
Your dad loves you.

12:47.892 --> 12:48.851
He'll come around.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.228
Yeah, but my dad doesn't let anything go.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.274
He still calls me "Toots" 'cause one time,
when I was three years old...

12:56.067 --> 12:57.401
I farted in the bathtub.

12:57.484 --> 13:00.321
[chuckling] That's funny.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.200
-Oh, I'm sorry... Toots.
-[scoffs] Stop.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.785
Look, it might not be today,

13:06.869 --> 13:11.165
might not be tomorrow, but eventually,
we're gonna be one big happy family.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.375
We'll have our stockings
hanging from the mantle.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.378
It'll be Chuck, Janice, Colt, Toots.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.588
[both chuckle]

13:21.300 --> 13:22.759
[TV playing indistinctly]

13:24.345 --> 13:25.387
Hey, babe.

13:25.471 --> 13:29.141
Oh, a bearded man in camo
bringing me Dairy Queen.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.267
[chuckles]

13:31.727 --> 13:34.897
Those girls on  The Bachelor
do not know what romance is.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.318
Wait, did you watch
The Bachelor  without me?

13:39.401 --> 13:42.029
Yeah. I didn't think you'd mind.
Casey didn't get a rose.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.656
Casey's gone? Man, fuck this day!

13:47.368 --> 13:49.453
I'm guessing your meeting
with Jerry didn't go well?

13:49.536 --> 13:50.787
[sighs] No, it did not go well.

13:50.872 --> 13:54.708
Gotta shut down the bar for three days.
It's gonna cost me a shit ton of money.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.920
By the way, you owe me $7
for your half of the DQ.

13:59.088 --> 14:03.050
-God! Shut down? I'm sorry, sweetie.
-[sighs] Yeah.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.302
Why am I getting punished, huh?

14:05.386 --> 14:08.472
I'm a small business owner, you know.
The backbone of America.

14:08.555 --> 14:10.224
I was gonna pay my taxes
and everything this year.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.643
Well, you know what? Fuck that!

14:13.602 --> 14:14.811
[chuckles]

14:16.230 --> 14:18.857
Yeah, tax evasion is awesome, honey,
but I think you're just upset.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.734
Yeah, because I didn't do anything wrong.

14:20.817 --> 14:24.321
Okay, well, um, you did serve a minor.

14:25.239 --> 14:28.325
How am I supposed to know?
Those are not the boobs of a 20-year-old.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.579
[chuckling] I don't think the boob defense
is gonna hold up in court.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.124
Yeah, Jerry said the same thing.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.252
I'm just saying it wouldn't kill you

14:38.335 --> 14:40.004
to take responsibility
for your actions sometimes.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.798
Mary, I'm not gonna take responsibility
for something that's not my fault.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.176
Yeah, but see, that's the thing.
It is never your fault.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.220
You know, you left your family ranch.
You said, "My dad's an asshole.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.513
-He wouldn't listen to me."
-Mmm-hmm.

14:49.596 --> 14:51.933
You got fired from Neumann's Hill.
"My boss is an asshole.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.850
-He had too many rules."
-Mmm-hmm.

14:53.935 --> 14:54.936
Yeah. Then you got a speeding ticket.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.189
You said the cop's an asshole
'cause he was jealous of your hair.

15:01.108 --> 15:04.236
He was. He was a bald fucking asshole.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.533
Exactly. It's never your fault, ever.

15:09.616 --> 15:12.828
I didn't come over here to have
you lecture me like I'm one of your kids.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.747
-Quit acting like one.
-I'm not. You know how I know?

15:15.831 --> 15:17.583
I'm not shooting out
babies like Pop-Tarts.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.006
Are you fucking kidding me?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.549
You know what, I don't need this shit.

15:25.632 --> 15:27.927
I'm gonna go home
and watch  Bachelor  by myself.

15:31.138 --> 15:34.100
He ends up hooking up with Britney P.
in the fantasy suite.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.603
You're a monster.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.445
[sighs] Hey, let me
ask you something, Dad.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.031
-Do you think it was my fault--
-Yes.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.619
Do you think it was my fault
the bar got busted?

15:53.702 --> 15:56.497
Can you guess what my answer's gonna be?

15:58.499 --> 16:00.709
-Yeah, but, Dad, they set me up--
-Rooster.

16:00.792 --> 16:03.629
Your mother ran that bar for 15 years.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.756
Never once got shut down.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.675
Well, that's not true.
One time, the bathroom flooded.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.721
That also was your fault.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.767
-Hello?
-Hey, Jen.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.270
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

16:19.353 --> 16:22.106
I was knocking on the front door,
but nobody answered.

16:23.815 --> 16:25.901
That's it. I'm boarding that thing up.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.945
Hey, can I get you a drink?
You want a beer or something?

16:29.030 --> 16:32.241
-I'm driving.
-Oh, so, like, you want a to-go cup, or...

16:32.992 --> 16:34.701
I'm fine. Thank you.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.704
I actually stopped by
because I have some good news.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.831
After you told me Peterson was out,

16:39.915 --> 16:43.877
I talked to my engineers and they took
satellite images of your land.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.298
First thing we noticed
is that on the roof of your barn,

16:47.381 --> 16:49.758
it says, "F you, Russia."

16:53.887 --> 16:55.056
After that,

16:55.139 --> 16:58.434
we found that there's an old dirt road

16:58.517 --> 17:01.895
that leads to this outbuilding.
Neither was on the original survey we had.

17:01.978 --> 17:03.522
Oh, yeah. That's not an outbuilding.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.399
That's the hunting cabin.
That's where I live.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.818
It's pretty badass.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.571
It's rustic, rugged. It's kinda like me.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.408
Which one are you? Colt or Chicken?

17:17.869 --> 17:18.787
He's Chicken.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.626
I never thought of this thing as a road.
It's more like a trail.

17:24.710 --> 17:29.381
All we need is permission to widen it
a little bit so the trucks can use it.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.384
[chuckles] Oh. Now Dad needs
my permission, huh?

17:33.510 --> 17:34.511
Which you have.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.599
This red line is the property line, right?

17:38.682 --> 17:39.725
Mmm-hmm.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.769
-So this grove of trees is on my side.
-Yes.

17:42.853 --> 17:46.690
So is this wonderful granite
and shale deposit.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.777
You probably don't care,
but that's like porn for geologists.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.614
Son of a bitch.

17:53.697 --> 17:56.367
That grove of trees is
where Peterson put that deer stand.

17:56.450 --> 17:59.161
For 30 years,
he's been telling me I was wrong,

17:59.245 --> 18:00.829
but here it is. I was right.

18:00.912 --> 18:04.040
Hey, who cares?
We don't need Peterson anymore.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.127
We can get the pipeline.
And the pipeline money.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.586
Which just leaves one question.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.631
Hey, Jen, how do you feel
about a pontoon boat?

18:13.134 --> 18:14.593
Not a big fan, Chicken.

18:17.721 --> 18:18.847
Fucking Chicken.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.523
-Hey, Dad.
-Morning.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.777
-You busy?
-Yep.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.364
Okay.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.034
[sighs loudly]

18:47.751 --> 18:49.336
[sighs loudly]

18:50.462 --> 18:53.089
Look, Colt, I'm in a good mood.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.301
It's calving season.

18:55.384 --> 18:58.345
We've got a pasture
full of healthy, pregnant cows.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.847
And later,
I'm gonna take this over to Peterson,

19:00.931 --> 19:03.642
roll it up tight and shove it up his ass.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.021
Well, at least one of us is happy.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.106
Sure wish I was.

19:11.608 --> 19:12.609
[sighs loudly]

19:14.570 --> 19:17.072
You know, I can roll
this thing up tight right now.

19:18.990 --> 19:19.950
What do you want?

19:21.076 --> 19:22.453
Did Mom's dad like you?

19:23.829 --> 19:28.542
Yeah, he loved me.
Why wouldn't he? I served my country.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.712
You know, I ran a successful business.

19:32.921 --> 19:36.925
I provided a safe and stable home
for his daughter.

19:37.759 --> 19:40.804
-Right.
-Abby's dad's not a fan?

19:40.887 --> 19:44.808
[groans] He's gonna fight this thing
with me and Abby the whole way.

19:44.891 --> 19:45.934
Yeah.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.397
It's too bad he's not a warm,
open-minded father like me.

19:52.649 --> 19:55.361
How do you want this thing
with her dad to end?

19:56.152 --> 19:58.864
I was hoping it'd end
with him on his deathbed,

19:58.947 --> 20:01.367
calling me over,
and whispering in my ear...

20:01.450 --> 20:03.244
"Thank you
for taking care of my daughter.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.372
By the way, I wanna give you
my cherry '66 Stingray."

20:06.913 --> 20:08.915
And ideally, that would happen next week.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.378
-Colt...
-You know, I invited him over for dinner.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.920
He didn't even bother to come.

20:14.004 --> 20:17.591
[stutters] And I bought that,
you know, that expensive spray cheese.

20:17.674 --> 20:21.803
It's, like, brie-flavored.
I think that's French for cheese.

20:24.265 --> 20:28.310
That clearly makes up for years
of you acting like a dipshit.

20:30.354 --> 20:33.690
I mean... [stammers]
The worst part is it's killing Abby.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.611
I've been thinking for the last
couple of days how to fix this...

20:39.070 --> 20:40.489
You know what? Fuck him.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.702
Colt, this isn't just some referee
who made a wrong call.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.247
This is your future father-in-law.

20:49.498 --> 20:53.752
You gotta swallow your pride,
own up to your side of things.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.547
Figure out how to move forward.

20:57.548 --> 20:58.590
Be the bigger man.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.717
Why do I gotta be the bigger man?

21:00.801 --> 21:04.137
Well, if you're not, there's a good chance
this thing doesn't get fixed.

21:06.097 --> 21:08.267
[sighs] You're right.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.476
No shit.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.609
Mr. Phillips.

21:20.862 --> 21:24.157
Look what you did.
I missed the kill shot.

21:24.991 --> 21:26.660
Now I'm starting to think
I should have approached you

21:26.743 --> 21:28.412
when I saw you
in the sleeping bag section.

21:30.121 --> 21:31.290
What are you doing here, Colt?

21:32.416 --> 21:35.836
We need to talk.
Uh, Mrs. Phillips said you weren't home,

21:35.919 --> 21:38.547
so I knew there's only
three places you could be.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.799
You weren't at work,
you weren't at Wendy's.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.510
Uh, that left the Bass Pro Shops.

21:43.594 --> 21:46.638
Oh, uh, also, I... I got you a Baconator.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.182
You like Frosties, right?

21:49.265 --> 21:50.934
Not hungry, thanks.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.686
Okay.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.772
Good. [stutters] I'll be honest with you.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.608
I ate half the Frosty
on the way over here.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.027
Um...

22:03.655 --> 22:05.616
Look, I know you don't like me.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.659
You're right.
Good talk, Colt.

22:09.661 --> 22:14.666
But I also know that I haven't given you
much of a reason to like me.

22:15.626 --> 22:17.378
You haven't given me
any reason to like you.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.171
Okay. Um...

22:22.383 --> 22:24.175
You know, I'm a different person now.

22:24.259 --> 22:27.638
The... the guy that you knew when I was
in high school doesn't exist anymore.

22:27.721 --> 22:31.307
Does the guy who knocked up
Heather Roth a few months ago exist?

22:33.226 --> 22:34.436
That's fair.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.147
I made a mistake.

22:37.898 --> 22:41.485
But I didn't run.
I stepped up and did the right thing.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.947
Mr. Phillips,
haven't you ever made a mistake?

22:46.615 --> 22:50.160
Colt, my worst mistake would be
your crowning achievement.

22:52.413 --> 22:55.040
Nothing you can say is gonna
make me change my mind.

22:55.123 --> 22:59.377
Okay, uh, we're getting married.
So we gotta figure this thing out.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.547
Not for me, not for you, but for Abby.

23:01.630 --> 23:06.384
Don't you think I want to walk
my own daughter down the aisle?

23:06.468 --> 23:10.013
Don't you think I want a son-in-law
to hunt with, instead of hunt down?

23:12.098 --> 23:14.685
But it's my job to protect my daughter.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.020
And I can't protect her from you,
and that kills me.

23:17.103 --> 23:19.314
Yeah, it's also killing her.

23:19.397 --> 23:20.691
Well, that's on you, Colt.

23:21.692 --> 23:22.859
Yeah.

23:24.402 --> 23:25.403
Me.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.491
No. No. You know what?

23:29.575 --> 23:32.160
I came over here to be the bigger man.

23:32.243 --> 23:35.914
But you don't want to solve this,
you... you just want to be right.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.042
I'm the asshole? Nah.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.044
You're the asshole.

23:41.127 --> 23:42.754
Excuse me?

23:42.838 --> 23:46.467
You claim that you love your daughter.
You claim you wanna protect her.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.343
But all you're doing
is turning your back on her.

23:48.426 --> 23:51.847
You know, someday, God willing,
we're gonna have kids,

23:51.930 --> 23:54.766
and I can't imagine hurting them
the way you're hurting her.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.186
Don't you dare lecture me.

23:58.269 --> 24:00.897
You have no idea
what the fuck you're talking about.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.899
Well, I know one thing.

24:02.983 --> 24:06.695
This, right here,
this is your biggest mistake.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.417
[sighs] Rooster, what are you doing here?

24:21.502 --> 24:24.755
Hey, look, I came to apologize, all right?

24:25.756 --> 24:27.758
Now, I wanted to get you
a rose like on  The Bachelor

24:27.841 --> 24:31.302
but Circle K was out of flowers,
so I got you a churro.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.808
-There's a bite out of it.
-And I'll admit that that's my fault.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.689
-[sighs] Rooster, we gotta--
-Look, look, just sit down for a second.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.190
Let me just say this, okay?

24:44.858 --> 24:46.484
[sighs deeply]

24:46.568 --> 24:48.779
I was pissed about getting busted...

24:49.445 --> 24:52.198
but you're right, it was my fault
and I need to own up to that.

24:52.783 --> 24:55.911
I was having a really shit day,
and I just completely took it out on you.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.580
The truth is...

24:59.540 --> 25:01.457
you're the best thing I got going on
in my life right now.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.670
[sighs] Do you wanna marry me?

25:05.629 --> 25:06.630
Oh, shit.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.759
Wow. No, marriage, you know.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.553
Mary, it's just, I hadn't given it
a lot of thought yet--

25:12.636 --> 25:14.763
No, it's fine.
I don't wanna marry you, either.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.807
Okay. Harsh. At least I was pretending.

25:18.391 --> 25:21.352
Look, the other night,
we got in this big fight, you stormed out,

25:21.436 --> 25:24.690
and I didn't even think
about burning your laundry.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.194
I just listened
to Lee Brice and folded it.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.281
-So, what's wrong with that?
-Everything.

25:34.365 --> 25:36.702
I wanna have a deeper connection.

25:37.452 --> 25:40.872
You know, I wanna love
someone enough to burn their shit.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.336
What are you saying?
I mean, we have a good time together.

25:46.419 --> 25:50.381
Yeah, we do. We like the same TV shows,
we like having sex.

25:50.465 --> 25:51.507
Exactly.

25:52.593 --> 25:55.470
[chuckles] For a second there, I thought
you were breaking up with me.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.097
I am breaking up with you.

25:58.181 --> 25:59.182
Oh.

26:01.392 --> 26:03.561
-Okay.
-[stutters] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.230
You are a great guy...

26:06.314 --> 26:08.692
but it's just not enough anymore.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.695
Right.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.491
Well, I'm not sure what to say. [sighs]

26:18.118 --> 26:20.453
I think I'll just get out of here.
[clears throat]

26:22.288 --> 26:23.790
I'm really, really sorry.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.918
No, it's fine. I'll be good.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.130
Look, Mary,
you're a real cool chick, you know.

26:31.339 --> 26:34.926
And I hope, someday, you find somebody
whose shit you wanna burn.

26:44.144 --> 26:47.939
This kid wrote that Abraham Lincoln
was the father of our country.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.317
Smart kid.
One of your honor students?

26:53.111 --> 26:54.112
No.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.239
[doorbell rings]

26:57.032 --> 26:59.159
Whatever, Abraham Lincoln was the best.

26:59.242 --> 27:02.162
He freed the slaves and he was
a kick-ass vampire hunter.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.960
Jeff Scurry, this is your lucky day.

27:09.044 --> 27:12.505
With one simple line,
your "F" becomes an "A."

27:12.588 --> 27:13.589
[door closes]

27:14.800 --> 27:17.427
Oh, shit, Mr. Phillips.

27:18.804 --> 27:19.930
Can I talk to Abby?

27:20.013 --> 27:22.015
[sighs] It's fine, Dad. He can stay.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.142
No, no. You two... you two talk.

27:24.225 --> 27:26.477
I'll just help you grade
some of these papers.

27:26.561 --> 27:27.938
Please, don't.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.649
Right. Okay.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.861
[stutters] Just so you know,
there's two sides to every story.

27:34.945 --> 27:35.946
I bought him a Baconator.

27:38.740 --> 27:41.326
All right, if you're here
to lecture me again about Colt,

27:41.409 --> 27:43.078
I don't want to hear it.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.538
No, I'm... I'm here 'cause...

27:47.290 --> 27:50.293
Oh, Christ, how can I say this?

27:52.295 --> 27:56.925
When you were about 14,
you did something that really upset me.

27:57.508 --> 27:59.928
Oh, you mean when I started smoking weed?

28:00.011 --> 28:02.638
What? No.
You smoke weed?

28:04.975 --> 28:07.185
Tried it once, hated it.
Keep going.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.731
No, I'm... I'm talking
about that phase you went through

28:10.814 --> 28:15.401
where you stopped being a Broncos fan
and started rooting for the Cowboys.

28:15.485 --> 28:19.072
-Yeah, you hated that.
-One time, Denver was playing Dallas.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.784
And I was hoping
the Broncos would crush 'em

28:22.868 --> 28:25.871
and you'd come back to your senses.

28:27.789 --> 28:31.251
But the crazy thing is...
once the game started,

28:31.334 --> 28:35.046
and I saw you sitting there
in your stupid Troy Aikman jersey...

28:36.631 --> 28:39.384
I found myself rooting for the Cowboys.

28:40.426 --> 28:43.096
What? [chuckles] Why?

28:43.179 --> 28:46.349
Because I knew
how happy you'd be if they won.

28:47.475 --> 28:51.021
I wasn't really rooting for the Cowboys.
I was rooting for you.

28:51.855 --> 28:55.066
Abby, I would do anything
to make you happy.

28:55.776 --> 28:58.486
Even if it meant
supporting something I hate.

29:00.030 --> 29:03.033
[chuckles softly] Colt's the Cowboys
of boyfriends, isn't he?

29:05.827 --> 29:07.996
Colt's the Cleveland Browns.

29:10.373 --> 29:12.500
I'm still not sold on him, but...

29:13.960 --> 29:16.755
-I know that you love him.
-I really do.

29:16.838 --> 29:19.049
And he says he loves you.

29:20.508 --> 29:21.717
[sighs deeply]

29:21.802 --> 29:24.137
If I can put up
with Troy Aikman in your life,

29:24.220 --> 29:26.306
-I can put up with Colt Bennett.
-[chuckles]

29:28.558 --> 29:31.186
-So, you'll be at our wedding?
-Of course.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.898
-You're my little Toots.
-[chuckles]

29:39.110 --> 29:40.070
I love you.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.240
I love you too, Dad.
Come here. Thank you.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.915
What the fuck you
doing on my property?

29:51.998 --> 29:54.042
Hey, Sam, it's me.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.626
Why do you think I have this gun?

29:58.338 --> 29:59.339
What are you doing here?

30:00.715 --> 30:05.011
I'm here to apologize to my neighbor
and return his deer stand.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.681
Get the fuck off my land.

30:08.764 --> 30:12.560
Hey, Sam, you're right.
You were always right.

30:13.769 --> 30:14.938
This is your property.

30:15.021 --> 30:16.898
I know what you're doing.

30:17.607 --> 30:20.986
You're trying to get me to sign off
on that access road. It's not gonna work.

30:21.777 --> 30:24.280
I don't need it.
They found another way in.

30:25.448 --> 30:26.950
I'm here because of...

30:30.286 --> 30:31.246
the snow plow.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.332
What the fuck you talking about?

30:35.333 --> 30:36.835
The morning Rooster was born,

30:36.918 --> 30:39.754
and Maggie and I were stranded
down at the fire station.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.298
You hooked that blade up to your pickup

30:42.382 --> 30:44.509
and drove all the way
down there to bring us home.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.929
You were a good neighbor.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.473
Hell, you were a good friend.

30:51.724 --> 30:54.352
This damn thing has gotten
in our way for way too long.

30:54.435 --> 30:56.146
Only 'cause you let it.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.689
All right, I've said my piece.

31:01.317 --> 31:03.987
Enjoy your deer stand.
I'm going home.

31:04.070 --> 31:06.781
All this being nice
has made me fucking exhausted.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.832
All we had was a laundry basket.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.712
-What?
-For Rooster's car seat...

31:21.796 --> 31:23.173
that morning we brought him home.

31:24.132 --> 31:28.636
He slept all the way on a pile
of freshly washed linens.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.140
He threw up all over those sheets.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.935
Yeah, he's still doing that.

31:40.190 --> 31:43.026
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you
when Estelle passed.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.279
Thanks for saying that.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.200
I'm... I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you when Maggie left.

31:51.952 --> 31:55.413
Although... I can't say I blame her.

31:58.041 --> 32:01.377
-Fuck you, Sam.
-[chuckles] Fuck you too, Beau.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.967
[country music playing]
