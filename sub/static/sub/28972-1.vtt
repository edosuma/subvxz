01:58.074 --> 01:59.423
I'm gonna kill you.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.846
They said
the wars were terrible

02:30.889 --> 02:33.240
and sectors were built
to keep the people safe,

02:33.283 --> 02:35.807
led by men who value
knowledge and logic,

02:39.333 --> 02:41.987
one man called Dominion
led people to think

02:42.031 --> 02:44.120
he was honorable and honest.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.817
Many still believe that.

02:45.861 --> 02:49.081
The truth is, he
has created anarchy.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.685
Over a billion people
have been murdered

02:50.692 --> 02:53.564
under the hands of
Dominion Industries.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.578
Growing up, I tried to
figure out who I was.

03:07.622 --> 03:11.756
Now, more than ever, I
don't know who I truly am,

03:11.800 --> 03:14.672
but I, along with
other deviants,

03:14.716 --> 03:15.934
have already been labeled.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.501
We've already been cast out.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.634
We were the ones
blamed for the wars

03:19.677 --> 03:22.158
and each and every
single day, we fight.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.116
We fight for what's right.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.683
We fight for our lives.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.946
We fight to survive.

05:23.932 --> 05:24.932
Let's move.

05:40.905 --> 05:43.299
Is this a part of your plan?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.648
Where are we going?

05:44.692 --> 05:45.692
What now?

05:47.347 --> 05:48.348
I don't know.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.391
What?

06:09.499 --> 06:11.414
You just don't
give up, do you?

06:17.638 --> 06:22.599
You know, watching you
kill those other fighters

06:23.818 --> 06:27.169
almost makes me feel
bad.

06:27.212 --> 06:28.866
Not yet.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.652
Not that way.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.480
Did you really think

06:33.523 --> 06:37.266
defeating me would
grant you your freedom?

06:41.357 --> 06:42.357
You feel that?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.100
That's death creeping in.

06:47.363 --> 06:48.582
The end is rising.

06:50.235 --> 06:51.976
Don't worry.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.717
I'll make it quick.

06:53.761 --> 06:56.285
I didn't ask for this.

06:56.328 --> 06:59.593
I don't want to do this, but...

07:12.257 --> 07:15.435
Dominion will fall.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.374
I win.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.339
It is revealed.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.436
It will return.

08:06.877 --> 08:09.445
We are witnessing
history in the making.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.273
The tale of a young
fighter has flourished

08:12.274 --> 08:13.797
into a legendary moment.

08:13.841 --> 08:17.453
The world's most powerful
deviant stands before us.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.456
United States has once
again proven to be

08:20.500 --> 08:23.024
the strongest sector
on the planet.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.643
I told you she'd win.

08:33.687 --> 08:37.472
When are you gonna
learn to just trust me?

10:03.559 --> 10:04.995
Wow.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.039
We're on.

10:07.737 --> 10:08.869
Chris.

10:08.912 --> 10:09.696
Huh?

10:09.739 --> 10:10.739
We're on.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.526
Tonight's events will change
the world as we know it.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.920
Let us recap this
year's battles.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.053
Please stay with us
because when we return,

10:19.096 --> 10:21.142
the annual victor
walk will commence.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.927
And we're out.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.434
We need to hurry.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.479
It's this way.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.043
Trikalypse,

13:03.086 --> 13:03.826
Trikalypse, I'm
your biggest fan.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.567
Trikalypse, I love you!

13:05.610 --> 13:07.874
We need a win, Trikalypse.

13:31.854 --> 13:32.854
Oh shit.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.294
I'm keeping it running.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.112
You're coming with us.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.155
No.

14:54.676 --> 14:55.676
Let's move.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.508
Scramble the security teams,

15:00.551 --> 15:02.771
sweep the corridor with
a UV light immediately.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.499
Boo.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.695
Sir, they got away.

15:58.740 --> 15:59.915
They got away.

16:02.178 --> 16:04.267
They have also taken
Fresno with them.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.973
Is there anything else?

16:14.016 --> 16:16.018
We found the body
of Major Bid, sir.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.106
We were betrayed.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.980
Lieutenant Jankins
led them to escape.

16:26.942 --> 16:27.987
Major Hart,

16:29.162 --> 16:30.424
Sir?

16:30.467 --> 16:31.729
You're in command now.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.905
Assemble Alpha Team and find em.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.995
Have my daughters go
to the south quarters.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.344
Yes, sir.

16:37.387 --> 16:38.387
Move out.

16:47.223 --> 16:50.531
This is the main
entrance checkpoint.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.971
Are you okay?

16:56.015 --> 16:56.798
No.

16:56.841 --> 16:57.841
Yes.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.280
I mean, I don't know.

17:50.112 --> 17:53.681
I thought sanctuary
camps no longer existed.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.813
Above ground they're illegal,

17:55.857 --> 17:57.728
but we've learned to
survive down here.

18:16.486 --> 18:17.357
Is that her?

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
Yeah.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.928
They've been following you
throughout the entire show.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.714
Some of them look up to you.

18:27.758 --> 18:28.977
We're saved.

18:35.940 --> 18:36.940
Others well,

18:37.638 --> 18:38.943
they're not so supportive.

18:55.525 --> 18:56.525
It means freedom.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.225
It's a reminder of why we fight.

19:14.327 --> 19:15.805
You and the others
are more than welcome

19:15.806 --> 19:17.373
to stay for as
long as you'd like.

19:18.722 --> 19:19.984
You should get some rest.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.597
We're still waiting for
the second team to arrive.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.468
They should be back
from D.I. Soon.

19:25.512 --> 19:26.730
D.I.?

19:26.774 --> 19:29.211
It's our way of saying
Dominion Industries.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.126
We don't acknowledge
his name entirely.

19:32.823 --> 19:35.217
Why
are they still there?

19:35.261 --> 19:37.001
Our first objective
was to get you out.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.962
The second was to
take D.I. down.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.094
Get some rest.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.445
I'll have someone notify
you when they return.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.191
There.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.272
This is how they treat us.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.102
This is where they
want us to die.

21:20.148 --> 21:24.152
Do not fear.

21:24.195 --> 21:25.284
For I am born of death.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.812
You have all been
trapped in darkness,

21:34.336 --> 21:36.773
but you are all much more
powerful than you think.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.342
Reach down.

21:43.171 --> 21:46.174
Reach down into your
inner core and live.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.787
You will see that they
only made us stronger

21:52.876 --> 21:54.574
and everything
that they have done

21:56.097 --> 21:58.447
will turn to ashes
beneath our feet.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.008
That's impressive.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.282
So you're the winner.

23:37.503 --> 23:39.896
It's just, I didn't, sorry,
I just never thought of you

23:39.940 --> 23:43.291
as uh, well anyway, I watched
you throughout the whole show.

23:43.334 --> 23:44.597
I knew you'd be the winner.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.512
I mean the way you
took out D.K. was...

23:46.555 --> 23:48.035
Don't mind Evan here.

23:48.078 --> 23:50.211
This sapian is
somewhat of a fan.

23:50.254 --> 23:50.994
But...

23:51.038 --> 23:52.648
You mean you're...

23:52.692 --> 23:53.562
Human?

23:53.606 --> 23:54.998
Yeah, one of the few down here.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.438
I want to introduce
you to someone.

23:59.481 --> 24:00.439
Go on.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.440
What?

24:01.483 --> 24:02.571
All right, fine, fine.

24:03.877 --> 24:05.487
Sorry.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.096
Dominion Industry's headquarters

24:07.097 --> 24:11.058
have collapsed due to
a series of explosions.

24:11.101 --> 24:14.235
The attack happened
less than an hour ago.

24:14.278 --> 24:16.716
Authorities are still arriving.

24:16.759 --> 24:19.719
The number of casualties
is still rising.

24:19.762 --> 24:24.288
Again, Dominion Industry's
headquarters has collapsed

24:24.332 --> 24:27.378
due to a series of explosions,

24:27.422 --> 24:31.295
only 24 hours from
the previous attack.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.472
Authorities believe
these attacks

24:33.515 --> 24:35.474
are linked to the disappearance

24:35.517 --> 24:38.433
of T.V. personality,
Chris Fresno.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.391
Is it true?

24:40.435 --> 24:41.435
It is.

24:44.352 --> 24:45.222
Listen.

24:45.266 --> 24:46.615
Why?

24:46.659 --> 24:47.964
Innocent people are dead.

24:48.008 --> 24:49.966
That makes us no
better than them.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.794
You're right.

24:51.838 --> 24:52.882
I'm Calera.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.231
I run this place.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.584
For us, this is a safe haven,

24:58.627 --> 25:01.804
a place where both humans
and deviants are one.

25:01.848 --> 25:04.111
Follow me, I'd like
to show you something.

25:18.473 --> 25:21.389
Everything that's
happened was set in motion

25:21.432 --> 25:23.130
even before the show began.

25:26.263 --> 25:27.961
Winning comes with sacrifice.

25:28.004 --> 25:30.224
We knew what the
consequences would be

25:30.267 --> 25:32.095
even before it all started.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.143
Were the
consequences worth it?

25:36.186 --> 25:37.318
We got you out.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.999
The second team found
her barely breathing

26:06.042 --> 26:07.261
along with a few more.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.788
How,

26:12.832 --> 26:14.877
how is this possible?

26:14.921 --> 26:17.576
Seems like she's healing
herself from the inside out.

26:30.676 --> 26:31.633
Sir.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.635
Find them and end them.

26:35.942 --> 26:39.598
Bring her to me even if
it's her head on a stick.

26:41.164 --> 26:42.164
Sir.

26:48.476 --> 26:49.390
El.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.392
Yes sir?

26:51.435 --> 26:53.089
Are you settled in?

26:53.133 --> 26:54.133
Yes, sir.

26:57.224 --> 26:58.660
You heard what he said,

26:58.704 --> 27:00.053
aim to kill.

27:00.096 --> 27:02.272
Dead or alive.

27:02.316 --> 27:05.101
Oh I can't believe this
is it, our first mission.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.893
You do understand the
importance of this mission, right?

27:15.198 --> 27:16.983
You make one mistake
and it'll be your head

27:17.026 --> 27:18.245
I take back to Dominion.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.641
You may be used to the way
Bedsor did things around here,

27:22.684 --> 27:23.859
but I'm in charge now.

27:25.426 --> 27:27.733
And if any one of you make
the slightest mistake,

27:27.776 --> 27:29.691
you'll be tasting the
bottom of my boot so fast,

27:29.735 --> 27:30.953
you won't see it coming.

27:45.576 --> 27:48.405
All of you have been
given a second chance.

27:48.449 --> 27:49.842
It may not seem like it now,

27:49.885 --> 27:51.757
but you all were
chosen for a reason.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.021
I could not imagine what
you all went through,

27:55.064 --> 27:58.764
but you survived and
we'll continue to fight

27:58.807 --> 28:00.417
and bring down D.I..

28:00.461 --> 28:02.681
Today's events were
just the first steps

28:02.724 --> 28:04.683
to bringing peace and
order to the world.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.599
And you?

28:08.643 --> 28:11.733
You will be the one that
brings an end to it all.

28:11.777 --> 28:12.777
How?

28:13.822 --> 28:15.128
With violence?

28:15.171 --> 28:17.696
By going through
this all over again?

28:17.739 --> 28:18.739
No.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.962
Look, we got you all out.

28:24.267 --> 28:27.836
Some of us didn't make
it, Dominic, Costa,

28:27.880 --> 28:32.798
Alios, Bloodshed, they
died for what's right.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.496
They died for all of you.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.760
Each one of them
believed in you.

28:41.023 --> 28:43.765
They did what they needed
to do for the mission,

28:43.809 --> 28:45.724
even if it meant death.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.856
Jankins,

28:47.900 --> 28:48.944
you guys gotta see this.

28:54.471 --> 28:57.648
People of the
world, I address you as one.

28:57.692 --> 29:02.566
Since the wars, the planet
has found a way to survive.

29:02.610 --> 29:05.613
It is survival built
on trust and order.

29:05.656 --> 29:07.658
In the past 48 hours,
you have watched

29:07.702 --> 29:09.582
a great amount of violence
following the actions

29:09.617 --> 29:11.575
of some of the chosen
deviants in this age

29:11.619 --> 29:12.751
of the Immortal Wars.

29:14.056 --> 29:16.189
They have caused a great
amount of destruction

29:16.232 --> 29:19.627
as well as taking the
lives of my fellow leaders.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.237
What?

29:21.281 --> 29:24.066
Which brings me to announce,
effective immediately,

29:24.110 --> 29:28.027
I am honored and privileged
to step up as world leader.

29:29.593 --> 29:33.510
These are dark days and those
who follow this dark path,

29:34.816 --> 29:38.472
your actions are based
on misleading beliefs,

29:39.952 --> 29:41.780
beliefs that go against the law.

29:43.738 --> 29:46.219
Deviants are the reason
this planet cracked.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.657
We stopped them from
bringing us down.

29:50.963 --> 29:53.792
We taught our children
the right way of life,

29:53.835 --> 29:55.445
with peace and humility.

29:56.664 --> 30:00.276
Disbelieving in that
puts the system at risk.

30:01.538 --> 30:04.367
Dominion Industries
provides for the people

30:04.411 --> 30:06.848
security and order.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.677
Without it, the world as we
know it will cease to exist.

30:10.678 --> 30:14.073
It'd be filled with crime,
destruction and death.

30:14.116 --> 30:18.033
The individuals you
see are not human.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.734
They cause destruction.

30:23.778 --> 30:26.781
They bring death
and that is why,

30:26.825 --> 30:28.130
from this day forward,

30:29.828 --> 30:32.091
all deviants will be
taken into custody.

30:33.701 --> 30:38.314
Those who follow their paths
will be considered a traitor,

30:39.098 --> 30:40.098
traitor to the people.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.929
Showing support or
displaying civilization

30:43.972 --> 30:45.800
with these criminals
will be considered

30:45.844 --> 30:48.324
an act of treason as
well, punishable by death.

30:51.588 --> 30:54.156
Justice shall be served.

30:55.418 --> 30:59.161
Trikalypse and
our fellow futures

30:59.205 --> 31:01.076
must pay for what
they have done.

31:01.120 --> 31:05.298
I promise, to the people of
Lambent and fellow sectors,

31:06.212 --> 31:07.212
this will end.

31:09.041 --> 31:13.959
Hand over Trikalypse, or
everyday death shall follow.

31:28.799 --> 31:29.931
What's the plan?

31:29.975 --> 31:31.193
We continue on.

31:31.237 --> 31:32.891
Objective three will commence.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.022
Let's go.

32:02.529 --> 32:03.529
Hey Charge,

32:07.621 --> 32:08.970
looks like we found your match.

32:16.847 --> 32:18.414
You got an army
around here, huh?

32:19.894 --> 32:22.723
I agree with Mr. Tall,
Dark and Dangerous here.

32:26.596 --> 32:28.381
Come on, man, why?

32:28.424 --> 32:29.686
Why what?

32:29.730 --> 32:30.730
Why now?

32:32.254 --> 32:33.560
Why us?

32:33.603 --> 32:35.736
The fact that you
are all still alive

32:35.779 --> 32:38.391
makes you the group
that will save us all.

32:38.434 --> 32:40.088
You brought us back to life.

32:41.394 --> 32:42.394
We all died already.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.963
Yes, I brought you all back,

32:46.007 --> 32:47.617
but it can only happen once.

32:49.663 --> 32:50.751
It won't happen again.

32:52.622 --> 32:55.843
Your death was already gonna
happen because of this.

32:56.844 --> 32:57.844
What's that?

32:59.107 --> 33:01.631
This bug was planted
into each one of you

33:01.675 --> 33:02.806
during processing.

33:04.199 --> 33:06.810
Your death was set the
moment it entered your body.

33:08.116 --> 33:12.991
He controls it, your
strength, power, healing.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.517
It was already gonna happen.

33:18.909 --> 33:21.738
Once your time is up, it
releases a toxic pesticide

33:21.782 --> 33:26.395
into your bloodstream that
silently takes you out,

33:26.439 --> 33:29.050
but for some reason,
their system malfunctioned

33:29.094 --> 33:31.139
which gave us the
window to move in.

33:31.183 --> 33:34.012
Unfortunately, it
made you all targets,

33:35.056 --> 33:36.579
but your bug wasn't set.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.279
Dominion knew you would win
so he never turned it on.

33:44.152 --> 33:46.198
Ah, let me introduce you.

33:47.721 --> 33:52.595
Spike, Lucas, Lash,
Tiphoid, Ryon, and Edmond,

33:54.032 --> 33:55.946
these are your freedom fighters.

33:55.990 --> 33:59.689
Freedom fighters, yeah.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.996
They've also witnessed
the wrath of Dominion.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.914
Now, Trikalypse
will be leading us.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.437
What?

34:08.481 --> 34:09.830
Why me?

34:09.873 --> 34:11.918
You're the strongest
deviant ever recorded.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.574
You shook the ground
beneath Dominion.

34:15.618 --> 34:17.533
You cracked their system.

34:18.447 --> 34:19.447
It's true.

34:20.754 --> 34:23.016
You're the only one that
can end all of this.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.021
I believe in you.

34:28.283 --> 34:29.283
We

34:30.242 --> 34:31.504
Believe in you.

34:42.428 --> 34:43.342
El.

34:43.385 --> 34:44.386
Yes, sir?

34:44.429 --> 34:45.605
Any updates?

34:45.648 --> 34:47.607
I was able to track
the faint signal

34:47.650 --> 34:49.522
a few miles from
the east quarters.

34:49.565 --> 34:52.045
I'm working on pinpointing
its exact location.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.570
Patch me through to Hart.

34:57.312 --> 34:58.922
This is Hart.

34:58.966 --> 35:01.099
Round up a few
of the innocents.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.143
Sir?

35:02.187 --> 35:03.797
Round up a few
of the innocents.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.320
Make it live.

35:05.364 --> 35:06.626
The people of Lambent must know

35:06.669 --> 35:08.976
that she's taking our
kind down with her.

35:09.019 --> 35:10.020
You got me?

35:14.155 --> 35:15.155
You're set.

35:25.688 --> 35:27.342
It's okay, have a seat.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.135
You okay?

35:37.178 --> 35:38.178
Yeah.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.365
You know, during the shows,

35:52.237 --> 35:55.065
kinda had a hard time keeping
my composure around you.

35:56.110 --> 35:58.068
Yes, slipped a few times.

35:59.896 --> 36:00.896
Oh really?

36:01.724 --> 36:04.074
Just a little.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.322
They're awake.

36:47.727 --> 36:48.727
Iro.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.253
I'm alive?

36:58.085 --> 37:00.130
Yeah, you're back.

37:00.174 --> 37:02.089
Yeah, you're back.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.616
Looks like the
team's now complete.

37:26.374 --> 37:28.855
Let me go, let
me go, baby no, no.

37:29.725 --> 37:30.725
Please.

37:31.771 --> 37:33.816
Please get off me,
somebody help me!

37:33.860 --> 37:37.864
It's okay, it's okay,
baby, it's okay.

37:37.907 --> 37:42.303
These individuals have had
contact with the fugitives.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.392
No, nobody's done,
no miss, no, baby no.

37:45.959 --> 37:47.917
We haven't done anything.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.267
Let go.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.660
These individuals
have committed treason

37:52.574 --> 37:54.837
by helping these criminals.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.448
That was, let me go.

37:56.491 --> 38:01.017
Witness what she
is doing to us.

38:01.061 --> 38:02.192
She's killing us.

38:03.193 --> 38:04.630
She's killing our children.

38:04.673 --> 38:08.286
No, oh god, please
no, no, no, no baby, look.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.071
Baby, look at me.

38:13.073 --> 38:14.727
No, no, look at
me, look at me!

38:14.770 --> 38:16.424
No!

38:26.260 --> 38:28.088
She has to be stopped!

38:28.131 --> 38:29.089
I will find her and she'll pay

38:29.132 --> 38:30.569
for what she did to my family.

38:30.612 --> 38:32.310
She's killing us!

38:34.529 --> 38:38.577
In a few hours, nothing but
the objective will matter.

38:40.448 --> 38:41.448
Some will die.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.713
Others will continue forward.

38:46.062 --> 38:47.412
Prepare yourselves mentally.

38:48.543 --> 38:51.154
Physically you're ready.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.331
Otherwise you wouldn't
be here if you weren't.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.855
What you are all
about to go through

38:55.898 --> 38:58.684
is something that you have
never experienced before.

39:00.686 --> 39:02.514
All of your powers
have been charged.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.777
What Dominion doesn't
know is that the UV lines

39:05.778 --> 39:08.520
and the UV rounds
suppressed your powers,

39:09.477 --> 39:10.477
made them dormant.

39:11.958 --> 39:14.395
But in some way, all of your
powers have been charged.

39:16.005 --> 39:19.792
All of you have new abilities
that need to be discovered.

39:22.055 --> 39:23.622
Reach deep inside.

39:24.710 --> 39:27.365
Pull out the pain, the anger,

39:28.888 --> 39:31.325
all that is inside of
your heart and soul

39:32.718 --> 39:33.893
and use it.

40:17.545 --> 40:18.807
All my fault.

40:29.296 --> 40:30.340
It's my fault.

40:37.304 --> 40:38.914
You did this.

40:45.268 --> 40:47.182
How long have
you been standing there?

40:47.183 --> 40:50.012
Long enough to see you fly.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.450
What?

40:52.493 --> 40:54.974
You lifted off the ground.

40:57.063 --> 40:58.194
Can you do it again?

40:59.935 --> 41:00.935
I don't know.

41:12.339 --> 41:14.428
I can't.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.472
Yes you can.

41:19.172 --> 41:20.172
I know you can.

41:24.612 --> 41:25.612
Wow.

41:26.832 --> 41:28.790
When did this happen?

41:31.010 --> 41:33.142
Oh don't worry, he
didn't see anything.

41:34.230 --> 41:35.230
Let's suit up.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.323
So,

41:40.367 --> 41:41.499
Shut up.

41:43.805 --> 41:44.805
Sorry.

42:09.527 --> 42:13.400
Well well well, looks like
little Chrissy's finally up.

42:13.443 --> 42:14.575
Hey freak.

42:14.619 --> 42:16.664
All right,
guys, that's enough.

42:16.708 --> 42:17.708
Leave him alone.

42:19.275 --> 42:20.668
You're lucky.

42:34.900 --> 42:35.770
You know it's people like you

42:35.814 --> 42:37.511
that split me and my family up.

42:41.515 --> 42:44.387
They were killed by
Dominion and his soldiers.

42:46.389 --> 42:48.783
That night you came on
the nightly coverage

42:50.437 --> 42:53.092
and explained that a massive
cleansing was successful.

42:57.618 --> 42:59.577
This is where you
forced us to hide.

43:00.795 --> 43:03.406
Our kids aren't able
to see sunlight,

43:05.321 --> 43:07.236
unable to live a normal life?

43:10.500 --> 43:11.632
Just think about that.

43:23.078 --> 43:24.514
How did you get all this?

43:26.604 --> 43:29.694
Calera's been assembling
the team for some time now.

43:29.737 --> 43:32.610
Working undercover played
a big part in this.

43:32.653 --> 43:34.786
And that's where I come in.

43:34.829 --> 43:38.572
Before meeting Calera, I got
word there was a facility

43:38.616 --> 43:41.444
that was genetically
enhancing humans,

43:42.794 --> 43:46.667
trying to create the
ultimate soldier.

43:46.711 --> 43:50.323
So naturally, I had
to see for myself.

43:50.366 --> 43:53.935
I broke into D.I. and
did a self-guided tour.

43:55.371 --> 43:58.723
Security cameras,
hallways, ventilation shafts,

43:58.766 --> 44:01.508
Typhoid basically
created a map in his mind

44:01.551 --> 44:03.510
which we now have.

44:04.859 --> 44:07.253
But this map is
useless though.

44:07.296 --> 44:08.776
The whole facility
was destroyed.

44:10.299 --> 44:12.171
It was a decoy.

44:12.214 --> 44:13.563
That's right.

44:15.217 --> 44:17.829
You see the location he
held this year's show

44:17.872 --> 44:20.135
was at a building
Dominion just dressed up

44:20.179 --> 44:21.397
for the Immortal Wars.

44:22.834 --> 44:27.621
Well, you see, Dominion
has these fake distractions

44:28.448 --> 44:30.406
built all over the sector.

44:30.450 --> 44:32.582
When we got into their system,

44:32.626 --> 44:34.628
we discovered that
their main headquarters

44:34.672 --> 44:35.803
is just south from us.

44:36.978 --> 44:39.677
It's the exact
same building only,

44:42.636 --> 44:44.116
Underground.

44:44.159 --> 44:45.595
Oh hell no.

44:46.945 --> 44:50.731
Oh no, no, no, it's one
thing to be 100 levels up,

44:50.775 --> 44:53.516
but to be 100, 200
feet underground,

44:55.127 --> 44:57.129
you may as well be walking
to your own graves.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
He's right.

45:01.786 --> 45:03.788
That doesn't sound safe.

45:03.831 --> 45:06.007
That's why you're
not coming with us.

45:06.051 --> 45:07.574
You will help us get there.

45:08.880 --> 45:12.448
Trikalypse, Iro, Leo
and myself will go in.

45:12.492 --> 45:15.713
The rest of you,
take the exterior.

45:15.756 --> 45:18.933
And remember the facility is
rigged with security cameras

45:18.977 --> 45:21.675
that have all of our faces
recorded and targeted.

45:22.894 --> 45:24.678
Once we're inside,
we have to be quick.

45:25.940 --> 45:27.245
We have codes that
need to be entered

45:27.246 --> 45:29.204
into Dominion's system.

45:29.248 --> 45:30.728
Once these codes are entered,

45:30.771 --> 45:34.079
it will give us access to all
of Dominion's top secret files

45:35.733 --> 45:37.604
and will destroy any
security firewall.

45:39.998 --> 45:44.829
We do this, we expose Dominion
Industries to the world.

45:45.612 --> 45:46.656
That is the objective.

45:48.658 --> 45:51.183
Now we must stay off grid.

45:51.226 --> 45:52.924
Dominion has the area
tightly monitored

45:52.967 --> 45:54.273
so we travel by foot.

45:57.232 --> 45:58.581
All right, let's move out.

46:11.029 --> 46:12.770
She'll be safe.

46:12.813 --> 46:14.684
I'll be waiting
at the checkpoint.

46:18.645 --> 46:21.300
Sibyl,

46:21.343 --> 46:23.737
I never said thank
you for everything.

46:25.826 --> 46:26.826
It's part of my job.

46:28.742 --> 46:30.700
You're not coming with us?

46:30.744 --> 46:32.224
No.

46:32.267 --> 46:33.703
I don't fight.

46:33.747 --> 46:36.619
I stick with what
I'm good at, living.

46:40.623 --> 46:42.190
Come on, let's get you ready.

47:06.998 --> 47:08.608
When you spot the fugitives,

47:08.651 --> 47:12.873
you hold your formation
and you take no prisoners.

47:12.917 --> 47:15.833
Prime targets, Lieutenant
Jankins, Iro, Leo,

47:18.966 --> 47:21.534
Project Blackout,
and Trikalypse.

47:23.884 --> 47:27.714
So soldiers, whatever you
come across out there,

47:28.671 --> 47:29.890
understand one thing,

47:31.065 --> 47:32.719
you'll be in a
fight like no other.

47:35.374 --> 47:36.854
Move out.

47:36.897 --> 47:38.681
You heard her, move out.

47:38.725 --> 47:39.725
Let's go.

47:46.864 --> 47:47.908
Leave Trikalypse to me.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.215
But Dominion say to...

47:51.607 --> 47:52.608
I'm sorry, say again?

47:53.696 --> 47:55.568
Dominion isn't
here on the ground.

47:57.048 --> 47:58.353
Believe me,

47:58.397 --> 48:00.312
if she comes across
any of our subjects,

48:00.355 --> 48:02.009
she will end us.

48:03.358 --> 48:06.013
If you see her, you
better notify me.

48:06.057 --> 48:07.667
Do you understand?

49:21.262 --> 49:22.262
This way.

49:26.180 --> 49:28.182
It's roughly 100 yards
ahead to the left.

49:43.806 --> 49:44.806
Come on.

49:45.983 --> 49:46.983
Let's go.

50:07.482 --> 50:08.875
What is it?

50:08.918 --> 50:10.398
It's a quarantine area.

50:11.878 --> 50:13.183
When Dominion's science
projects go wrong,

50:13.184 --> 50:15.838
he disposes of them.

50:15.882 --> 50:17.666
He just throws them
out in the streets?

50:18.885 --> 50:20.843
It's his way of
population control.

50:22.149 --> 50:23.803
This guy gets more
twisted by the second.

50:23.846 --> 50:25.109
Yeah.

50:25.152 --> 50:27.241
If we split up, we
continue to the checkpoint.

50:27.285 --> 50:29.243
Sibyl and the others
will meet us there.

50:31.767 --> 50:32.767
Let's go.

51:47.713 --> 51:49.845
So how do you create it?

51:51.151 --> 51:52.935
I can't create it on my own.

51:52.979 --> 51:56.113
I can conduct the charge from
any power source around me.

51:56.156 --> 51:58.071
Have you tried to
create it on your own?

51:58.115 --> 51:59.115
It doesn't work.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.160
I'm sure you can.

52:02.771 --> 52:05.383
I had that problem
when I was younger.

52:05.426 --> 52:07.036
I practiced a lot

52:07.950 --> 52:10.127
and eventually,

52:18.047 --> 52:19.614
It began to spark.

52:25.098 --> 52:28.406
Maybe after all this,
I can teach you?

52:29.581 --> 52:30.973
I'd like that.

53:34.254 --> 53:35.254
Come on.

53:41.087 --> 53:42.087
Jesus.

53:43.698 --> 53:47.572
No, I don't want
to end up like these people.

53:47.615 --> 53:48.616
Did you hear me?

53:48.660 --> 53:51.140
Yes and you won't, okay?

53:53.273 --> 53:55.275
None of us will.

54:04.458 --> 54:06.155
How much
further do we have?

54:06.199 --> 54:07.679
Just another
couple of blocks.

54:07.722 --> 54:08.722
Straight this way.

54:46.761 --> 54:47.761
You good?

54:48.502 --> 54:49.502
Yeah.

54:51.549 --> 54:52.941
I'm sorry, I have to ask.

54:55.074 --> 54:56.162
Are you completely blind?

54:58.904 --> 54:59.948
I'm just curious.

55:01.646 --> 55:03.343
How do you know
where you're going?

55:03.387 --> 55:05.563
I see movements,
vibrations, sound.

55:07.260 --> 55:09.088
It's kind of like radar.

55:09.131 --> 55:11.264
Every few seconds, I
see vibration waves.

55:12.309 --> 55:13.310
That's cool.

55:14.223 --> 55:15.399
Have you always been blind?

55:26.366 --> 55:27.366
What is it?

55:29.978 --> 55:31.415
Hey,

55:31.458 --> 55:32.677
I thought I saw,

55:34.983 --> 55:35.983
nothing.

55:37.986 --> 55:38.944
You sure?

55:38.987 --> 55:40.293
Yeah.

56:13.587 --> 56:14.893
It's just up here.

56:14.936 --> 56:15.936
No, no, no, no, wait!

56:16.721 --> 56:17.721
No, no!

56:22.466 --> 56:24.424
We have to do something!

56:52.974 --> 56:53.974
Okay.

56:56.935 --> 56:59.067
Let's go, let's keep moving.

56:59.111 --> 57:00.547
What are you crazy?

57:00.591 --> 57:03.115
What if there are more of
those light things out there?

57:17.695 --> 57:19.523
Get it off us, move!

57:33.101 --> 57:34.538
This way, come on.

57:36.496 --> 57:37.976
This way, this way!

57:48.595 --> 57:50.423
Watch out!

57:52.730 --> 57:53.730
Go!

57:58.257 --> 58:02.609
You are entering
a high security area.

58:02.653 --> 58:06.961
All citizens must pass
through both scanners.

58:07.005 --> 58:10.095
Family members must pass
through security check.

58:10.138 --> 58:13.751
Once you have, proceed
in an orderly fashion.

58:28.679 --> 58:30.942
Confessions are being taken.

58:30.985 --> 58:33.640
The situation is under
high surveillance.

58:39.733 --> 58:42.344
She's
okay, let her pass.

59:00.537 --> 59:04.889
We've got movement
in quarantine zone three.

59:39.532 --> 59:40.838
I got you.

59:40.881 --> 59:42.143
I got you.

01:00:06.385 --> 01:00:08.300
Through here, here!

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:26.448
Hello?

01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:30.496
No!

01:00:30.539 --> 01:00:33.499
You, you killed her.

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:36.023
You killed her, why
did you do that?

01:00:36.067 --> 01:00:37.372
I was trying to help.

01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:38.634
I was helping
her, you killed her.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:39.766
That's enough!

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:44.728
That's enough!

01:00:54.781 --> 01:00:55.781
Come on.

01:00:58.567 --> 01:00:59.567
Come on, we have to go.

01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:04.835
We have to keep going.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:15.846
Hey.

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:17.369
You okay?

01:01:17.412 --> 01:01:18.413
Yeah.

01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:19.676
Come on, let's go.

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:32.210
Where the hell are they?

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:36.910
Is this it?

01:01:36.954 --> 01:01:37.824
This is the checkpoint.

01:01:37.868 --> 01:01:39.217
They should be here by now.

01:01:55.755 --> 01:01:57.931
The grounds are
crawling with guards.

01:01:57.975 --> 01:02:00.542
We'll have to pick
it up at sunrise.

01:02:00.586 --> 01:02:01.586
You okay?

01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:05.677
Edmond,

01:02:08.072 --> 01:02:09.595
where's Edmond?

01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:10.988
Sibyl.

01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:11.989
No.

01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:13.686
No, not Edmond.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:17.734
No please, no please,
not Edmond, please, no.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:20.737
No.

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:25.611
No, please.

01:02:25.654 --> 01:02:26.654
No.

01:02:27.265 --> 01:02:28.265
No.

01:02:36.665 --> 01:02:37.665
Damage report.

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:39.886
There definitely was movement.

01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:42.671
Radar detected high levels of
energy about 40 minutes ago.

01:02:46.284 --> 01:02:47.807
Scan the perimeter.

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:48.851
Yes, ma'am.

01:02:57.817 --> 01:02:59.384
This is Hart.

01:02:59.427 --> 01:03:01.298
I was able to pinpoint
that signal from the tracker.

01:03:01.299 --> 01:03:03.040
I'm sending over
the coordinates now.

01:03:04.128 --> 01:03:05.607
Three miles from headquarters?

01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.220
She must have found
a way to take it out.

01:03:12.658 --> 01:03:13.658
Where are you?

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:36.813
All right, guys, we'll
rest here for the night

01:03:36.856 --> 01:03:37.988
until things calm down.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:41.120
Get some rest.

01:03:45.212 --> 01:03:46.605
You all right?

01:03:46.648 --> 01:03:47.648
Yeah.

01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:51.784
Hey,

01:03:52.785 --> 01:03:53.785
hey,

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:56.615
look, it's not your fault.

01:03:58.878 --> 01:03:59.878
You did your best.

01:04:01.228 --> 01:04:02.926
She was dead before
your power hit.

01:04:10.672 --> 01:04:11.804
Don't worry about him.

01:04:16.417 --> 01:04:19.159
Every time I use my
power, someone dies.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:25.426
It's more like a
curse than a gift.

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.127
Maybe Dominion's right.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.871
Maybe I should be
locked away or dead.

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:37.873
No.

01:04:38.831 --> 01:04:40.659
No, you don't mean that.

01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:41.747
I know you don't.

01:04:43.488 --> 01:04:45.403
You're the reason
we're all still here.

01:04:47.709 --> 01:04:51.757
You need to believe,
just like we all do.

01:05:16.825 --> 01:05:18.740
This is it, isn't it?

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:24.006
What do you mean?

01:05:25.617 --> 01:05:29.969
Those things out
there, they were once me.

01:05:31.275 --> 01:05:33.059
Just another one of
their sick projects.

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.803
It's only a matter
of time before I

01:05:37.846 --> 01:05:39.065
change back to...

01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:40.109
No.

01:05:41.415 --> 01:05:42.764
You'd have changed by now.

01:05:50.511 --> 01:05:51.991
What did they do
to you in there?

01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.039
I don't know.

01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:03.655
My powers went from seeing
red to black and white.

01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:09.139
It's as if they
put a veil over me,

01:06:09.182 --> 01:06:10.749
something took over,

01:06:12.794 --> 01:06:16.276
something dark.

01:06:23.936 --> 01:06:25.111
So you did see once.

01:06:28.245 --> 01:06:29.942
You know what the color red is.

01:07:16.423 --> 01:07:17.423
You see?

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:26.868
All of this blood and
death is because of you.

01:07:32.222 --> 01:07:33.484
What's wrong?

01:07:37.401 --> 01:07:39.446
Nothing.

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:41.274
Let's go.

01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:42.318
Let's move.

01:07:58.117 --> 01:08:00.424
Hey man, wake up,
we're moving out.

01:08:14.699 --> 01:08:16.527
Poor guy, died angry.

01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:26.014
Let's go.

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:41.158
Come on.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:59.265
This way, let's keep moving.

01:09:19.981 --> 01:09:22.113
Hey right over
here, stick close.

01:09:29.861 --> 01:09:30.904
Hey, come on.

01:09:32.037 --> 01:09:33.256
No, you guys go ahead.

01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:37.346
Are you sure?

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:38.783
Yeah.

01:09:38.826 --> 01:09:40.001
We both know I don't fight.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:42.482
I'll head back to camp,

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.573
see if I can help Clara
tap into Dominion's system.

01:09:48.053 --> 01:09:49.968
Let's keep moving.

01:09:50.011 --> 01:09:51.011
Listen,

01:09:52.752 --> 01:09:54.189
make sure you stop this asshole.

01:10:13.165 --> 01:10:14.210
You hungry?

01:10:16.995 --> 01:10:19.171
We have movement,
30 yards out.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:20.128
They're here.

01:10:20.172 --> 01:10:21.217
Notify everyone.

01:10:43.978 --> 01:10:44.978
Mr. Fresno.

01:10:46.067 --> 01:10:47.243
Glad to see you're okay.

01:10:49.201 --> 01:10:51.072
No sign of Trikalypse, but uh,

01:10:51.116 --> 01:10:53.074
the mission wasn't a total loss.

01:10:53.118 --> 01:10:54.685
We're here to rescue you, sir.

01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:07.827
Mr. Fresno?

01:11:09.134 --> 01:11:10.178
Sir, are you okay?

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.985
It's okay, you're okay.

01:11:36.988 --> 01:11:38.250
They found our plans.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:39.599
We need to warn the others.

01:12:42.227 --> 01:12:44.969
There it is,
that's how we get in.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:47.363
Let's go.

01:13:07.513 --> 01:13:08.513
Wait.

01:13:10.298 --> 01:13:11.517
No, we have to keep going.

01:13:13.301 --> 01:13:14.520
No.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.221
Shit.

01:13:20.265 --> 01:13:21.397
How did she find us?

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:23.790
Well, well, well,

01:13:25.096 --> 01:13:27.664
if it isn't Trikalypse
and her band of freaks.

01:13:29.927 --> 01:13:31.755
Thanks to our secret operative,

01:13:31.798 --> 01:13:34.322
we were able to jump in
front of your current path.

01:13:42.983 --> 01:13:43.983
Hey.

01:13:46.247 --> 01:13:47.858
What have you done?

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:49.468
What?

01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:54.430
A man's gotta survive and
Dominion made an offer

01:13:55.387 --> 01:13:56.344
I couldn't pass up.

01:13:56.388 --> 01:13:57.433
How could you?

01:13:59.043 --> 01:14:00.827
Easy, like this.

01:14:02.133 --> 01:14:03.439
You'll die for this.

01:14:09.314 --> 01:14:11.272
We are not going with you.

01:14:11.316 --> 01:14:12.360
Oh really?

01:14:13.927 --> 01:14:15.451
Says who?

01:14:21.979 --> 01:14:22.979
It's about time,

01:14:24.198 --> 01:14:25.198
round two.

01:14:47.352 --> 01:14:49.223
You seem a bit weak.

01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:50.834
Why are you holding back?

01:14:50.877 --> 01:14:52.400
I'm not trying to kill you.

01:15:14.466 --> 01:15:16.642
I promise I won't hit hard.

01:15:19.819 --> 01:15:21.342
Is that it, come on!

01:15:33.006 --> 01:15:34.486
Don't hold back.

01:15:35.356 --> 01:15:36.357
Go!

01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:52.547
She's mine.

01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:12.323
Snap out of it!

01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:26.510
You're not human.

01:17:27.294 --> 01:17:28.992
Not your typical human.

01:17:32.604 --> 01:17:34.388
Stay down or I'll make you.

01:17:47.314 --> 01:17:51.884
You know, I never understood
why you were the leader.

01:17:53.103 --> 01:17:54.234
You're pathetic.

01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:52.249
You picked the
wrong side, Jankins.

01:19:35.118 --> 01:19:36.597
Just give it up.

01:19:36.641 --> 01:19:38.643
There's no way you can beat me.

01:19:40.514 --> 01:19:42.299
I'm stronger than you.

01:20:16.246 --> 01:20:17.246
No.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:48.843
Wake up,

01:20:49.496 --> 01:20:51.629
wake up, Jankins, wake up.

01:21:36.587 --> 01:21:39.764
No.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.493
Hey, we got something.

01:22:56.536 --> 01:22:57.450
Seems like a pretty big pulse,

01:22:57.494 --> 01:22:59.670
about three miles from D.I..

01:22:59.713 --> 01:23:02.412
Finally, only she
can cause such a spike.

01:23:02.455 --> 01:23:03.848
They are only a
couple miles away.

01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:04.979
Yeah, now we
have to figure out

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.807
a way to scramble security.

01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:08.244
I have an idea.

01:23:08.287 --> 01:23:10.419
I can shut down the system
the moment they are detected.

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.988
That'll give em 15 minutes
to make their move.

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.034
After that, they're
on their own.

01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:18.297
El controls everything
from the inside

01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:20.647
and it'll be
impossible to stop her.

01:23:20.691 --> 01:23:23.476
Well then, Trikalypse
will have to figure it out.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.869
Be ready for when they arrive.

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.002
What is it?

01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:32.659
You know we can't stop her.

01:23:32.703 --> 01:23:34.444
She's programmed to kill.

01:23:34.487 --> 01:23:35.923
They're walking
into a death trap.

01:23:35.967 --> 01:23:37.534
Yeah, but that's
why we chose her.

01:23:37.577 --> 01:23:38.622
They can do this.

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:44.541
As one of his failed programs,

01:23:44.584 --> 01:23:46.282
you know there's
always a glitch.

01:23:49.415 --> 01:23:50.415
God help them.

01:23:56.857 --> 01:23:58.685
I can't bury him yet.

01:23:58.729 --> 01:24:00.948
Maybe Sibyl can bring him back.

01:24:00.992 --> 01:24:01.993
He's not one of us.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:03.038
We have to try.

01:24:08.565 --> 01:24:09.565
You be brave, okay?

01:24:11.089 --> 01:24:13.249
Spike's gonna take you back
to camp and you'll be safe.

01:24:33.633 --> 01:24:34.373
Go.

01:24:34.417 --> 01:24:35.417
Go now.

01:25:12.585 --> 01:25:14.021
I can't.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:21.116
Charge?

01:25:22.465 --> 01:25:23.465
Charge!

01:25:42.572 --> 01:25:45.052
This one hasn't
moved in a while.

01:25:45.096 --> 01:25:46.358
I think it's expired.

01:25:57.978 --> 01:25:58.979
What the fuck?

01:25:59.023 --> 01:26:01.330
Yeah, it's dead.

01:26:01.373 --> 01:26:03.984
Must have broke its
neck in the blast.

01:26:04.028 --> 01:26:05.203
Cut it down.

01:26:05.247 --> 01:26:06.726
You're disgusting.

01:26:16.606 --> 01:26:17.606
Hey!

01:26:22.089 --> 01:26:24.004
I'm going to kill you.

01:26:26.093 --> 01:26:27.225
We'll see about that.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:38.193
You really thought you
could beat us, didn't you?

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:22.280
Subject one,
sanitization complete.

01:27:31.289 --> 01:27:34.205
Subject two,
sanitization complete.

01:28:22.209 --> 01:28:23.254
So what's the plan?

01:28:26.953 --> 01:28:28.215
You two find the control room,

01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:31.349
scramble the system,
find an exit plan.

01:28:31.393 --> 01:28:33.308
Me and Iro will go for Dominion.

01:28:50.237 --> 01:28:51.237
Go.

01:28:52.065 --> 01:28:53.066
We got this.

01:29:14.392 --> 01:29:18.309
Oh god.

01:29:28.493 --> 01:29:29.493
These are humans.

01:29:30.626 --> 01:29:32.367
He's creating weapons.

01:29:35.413 --> 01:29:37.197
Let's get the
hell out of here.

01:29:46.206 --> 01:29:47.424
The subjects
are in holding.

01:29:47.425 --> 01:29:49.253
Let's get them transported
to separate labs

01:29:49.296 --> 01:29:51.255
so we can start the
draining process.

01:29:54.127 --> 01:29:55.520
Subject five

01:29:55.564 --> 01:29:56.826
What?

01:29:56.869 --> 01:29:57.740
Subject
five has escaped.

01:29:57.783 --> 01:29:58.863
How did this happen?

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:11.754
Come on.

01:30:35.517 --> 01:30:37.083
They didn't make it.

01:30:37.127 --> 01:30:39.303
We would have received
the security alert by now.

01:30:39.346 --> 01:30:41.218
Please, please.

01:30:41.261 --> 01:30:42.785
Hey.

01:30:42.828 --> 01:30:44.439
I got something.

01:30:44.482 --> 01:30:45.657
Claire, you guys there?

01:30:45.701 --> 01:30:46.701
Yes, yes.

01:30:47.572 --> 01:30:49.226
Glad you guys made it.

01:30:49.269 --> 01:30:50.270
Not all of us.

01:30:51.837 --> 01:30:55.450
Just me, Lucas, Iro and
Trikalypse that are left.

01:31:00.803 --> 01:31:02.281
Not sure how long we're
gonna have a connection.

01:31:02.282 --> 01:31:03.719
We need an exit plan.

01:31:05.155 --> 01:31:06.243
Sending it now.

01:31:13.511 --> 01:31:15.731
Lucas is inputting the codes.

01:31:19.212 --> 01:31:20.649
You guys get out of there.

01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:21.692
I got it.

01:31:27.438 --> 01:31:28.438
We're in.

01:32:02.386 --> 01:32:03.996
Are you okay?

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:07.783
Yeah, I just can't imagine
what all these people

01:32:07.826 --> 01:32:09.001
went through down here.

01:32:17.923 --> 01:32:18.923
Watch out!

01:32:49.607 --> 01:32:51.609
Can't you see we should
be fighting together?

01:32:51.653 --> 01:32:54.090
They're trying to kill us.

01:32:54.133 --> 01:32:57.354
That may be true,
but you killed me.

01:32:57.397 --> 01:32:58.921
So I'm going to kill you.

01:33:05.536 --> 01:33:08.495
Well, well, well,
look who got loose.

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:08.414
Help me.

01:36:08.458 --> 01:36:09.502
All of them?

01:36:09.546 --> 01:36:10.546
Help me!

01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:51.631
Get them out of here.

01:36:51.675 --> 01:36:53.024
Take her with you.

01:37:01.772 --> 01:37:02.817
Go with them.

01:37:05.994 --> 01:37:07.952
You win this.

01:37:07.996 --> 01:37:08.996
You end him.

01:38:58.497 --> 01:39:00.717
You know, when I
first laid eyes on you,

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.284
I knew you were the one.

01:39:02.327 --> 01:39:03.763
I knew you'd win.

01:39:03.807 --> 01:39:05.940
Ah, not so fast.

01:39:07.158 --> 01:39:08.812
You're one of us.

01:39:10.553 --> 01:39:13.730
As much as it
pains me to say, yes.

01:39:13.773 --> 01:39:15.819
Yes, I am.

01:39:15.862 --> 01:39:16.994
Why?

01:39:17.038 --> 01:39:19.866
Why?

01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:22.304
You know, I asked that
too when I lost her.

01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:24.828
She was all I had.

01:39:24.871 --> 01:39:26.308
I had a beautiful little girl,

01:39:26.351 --> 01:39:28.832
had her whole life
in front of her.

01:39:28.875 --> 01:39:30.442
All she ever wanted
was to help people.

01:39:30.486 --> 01:39:32.618
Ever since she was a
kid, all she ever wanted

01:39:32.662 --> 01:39:34.533
was to see everyone happy.

01:39:36.622 --> 01:39:38.711
But that all came to
an end and I lost her

01:39:39.756 --> 01:39:42.150
to someone of your kind.

01:39:42.193 --> 01:39:43.325
Our kind.

01:39:43.368 --> 01:39:46.371
The deviant
population was rising

01:39:46.415 --> 01:39:47.677
just as the human wars began.

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.896
It was the perfect opportunity.

01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:52.073
The government needed to
pinpoint those responsible.

01:39:52.116 --> 01:39:54.031
I saw it as my chance
and I ran with it.

01:39:55.946 --> 01:39:59.515
No hard feelings, just business.

01:40:03.475 --> 01:40:04.215
Hello father.

01:40:04.259 --> 01:40:05.259
Hello darling.

01:40:06.652 --> 01:40:09.873
I was able to save
one part of her,

01:40:09.916 --> 01:40:12.484
the part that would never
forget who I was to her.

01:40:12.528 --> 01:40:15.879
You did all this for her?

01:40:15.922 --> 01:40:17.924
It makes no difference.

01:40:17.968 --> 01:40:19.926
The world's gonna
know what you've done.

01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:22.407
Dominion Industries will
be exposed to everyone.

01:40:22.451 --> 01:40:24.018
You think it's easy?

01:40:26.890 --> 01:40:30.285
For over a decade, Dominion
Industries has run this planet.

01:40:30.328 --> 01:40:34.028
It's not going anywhere, even
after I die, it continues on.

01:40:34.071 --> 01:40:35.071
Now,

01:40:36.291 --> 01:40:37.857
did you come down
here to kill me

01:40:39.468 --> 01:40:41.948
or are you going to continue
to talk all this nonsense?

01:40:44.603 --> 01:40:47.171
You think I'm
going to fight you?

01:40:48.607 --> 01:40:49.607
No.

01:40:50.261 --> 01:40:52.394
You're gonna fight them.

01:42:26.749 --> 01:42:28.011
Typical Dominion,

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:34.974
getting others to fight
his battles for him.

01:42:37.107 --> 01:42:40.110
Too afraid to face
the fact that you're

01:42:44.549 --> 01:42:46.116
One of us?

01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:55.995
Not bad.

01:42:56.039 --> 01:43:00.826
Now before I let you kill me,
I wanna show you something.

01:43:01.566 --> 01:43:02.566
Yeah, what's that?

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:09.139
I need you to see the real me.

01:43:15.624 --> 01:43:20.585
There it is.

01:44:51.110 --> 01:44:52.110
Is it over?

01:44:53.025 --> 01:44:54.025
Yeah.

01:44:58.074 --> 01:44:59.423
We just got word
that D.I.'s files

01:44:59.467 --> 01:45:02.600
made it out to every
sector, every news outlet.

01:45:02.644 --> 01:45:05.081
Everyone's seeing the
truth about Dominion.

01:45:05.124 --> 01:45:06.300
That's good.

01:45:07.518 --> 01:45:09.303
That's real good.

01:45:35.198 --> 01:45:36.591
Come back to me.

01:46:09.493 --> 01:46:10.493
Uh,

01:46:11.452 --> 01:46:14.063
how is this possible?

01:46:14.106 --> 01:46:15.194
I don't know,

01:46:17.283 --> 01:46:18.676
but you're back.

01:46:32.342 --> 01:46:33.387
What's that?

01:46:43.484 --> 01:46:46.661
The new head of Dominion
Industries, Lori Harvey,

01:46:46.704 --> 01:46:47.704
breaks her silence.

01:46:49.098 --> 01:46:51.274
We'll correct the
mistakes made by my father

01:46:51.317 --> 01:46:52.754
and I promise to help those

01:46:52.797 --> 01:46:55.452
suffering under the
hands of the gifted ones.

01:46:55.496 --> 01:46:57.541
In other news, the
manhunt continues

01:46:57.585 --> 01:47:00.196
for the criminals which
rebel groups have deemed

01:47:00.239 --> 01:47:01.415
the vanquishers.

01:47:01.458 --> 01:47:04.679
Fugitives Trikalypse, Iro, Leo

01:47:04.722 --> 01:47:09.161
and other unidentified
deviants are still on the run.

01:47:10.946 --> 01:47:12.121
It's her.

01:49:54.457 --> 01:49:57.982
My dear sister, welcome back.

01:50:00.637 --> 01:50:02.813
I don't think so.
