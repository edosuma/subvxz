00:01.800 --> 00:03.640
- Make your peace.
- You can't shoot me!

00:03.675 --> 00:05.300
- Yeah, I can.
- I'm CIA.

00:05.390 --> 00:08.340
Al-Zuhari is targeting
western military bases.

00:08.345 --> 00:09.665
- Which bases?
- All of them

00:09.670 --> 00:12.125
- Do you know who the fuck I am?!
- I don't care who you are. Come here, mate.

00:12.145 --> 00:13.010
Don't.

00:13.020 --> 00:17.000
You killed the son of Arkady
Ulyanov in my fucking house!

00:17.005 --> 00:18.625
I have no idea who
you're talking about.

00:18.635 --> 00:22.820
You give me Kamali.
They murdered one of my men.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.865
- Let me show you something.
- Christ, Leo.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.885
I understand that
you don't trust me.

00:26.920 --> 00:31.570
Al-Zuhari will sacrifice anyone
and everything to achieve his goals:

00:31.605 --> 00:34.870
You must be prepared
to do the same.

00:53.471 --> 00:55.271
is it true he once...

01:13.780 --> 01:17.430
You're sweating.
Why are you nervous?

01:19.890 --> 01:22.175
Allah himself has
mapped out your path,

01:22.210 --> 01:25.180
and he wouldn't want any
harm to come to his believers,

01:25.690 --> 01:26.890
would he?

01:28.620 --> 01:30.500
Al-Zuhari has a request.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.675
Make life a lot easier
if he could pick up the phone, huh?

01:51.600 --> 01:53.615
Al-Zuhari must trust
you very much

01:53.620 --> 01:55.400
to have let you
carry this message.

01:55.870 --> 01:58.230
You are to be rewarded.

02:01.610 --> 02:03.290
Wait here.

02:13.430 --> 02:14.860
Kaboom.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.233
BEIRUT, LIBANON

04:02.400 --> 04:04.414
Good to see you, Amir.

04:05.895 --> 04:08.415
I hear it may happen very soon.

04:09.599 --> 04:11.200
An Al-Zuhari will be...

04:12.480 --> 04:14.760
Such things are not spoken.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.000
Forgive me.

04:17.502 --> 04:19.250
<i>My words fail me.</i>

04:19.555 --> 04:20.904
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

04:22.310 --> 04:26.646
- You have a message?
- The Scotsman must be paid

04:41.977 --> 04:43.377
Traitor!

04:45.130 --> 04:46.790
You've been made.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.430
Fuck.

04:56.430 --> 05:00.120
Bravo Team, I want Amir alive.

05:02.830 --> 05:04.490
There's a lot of
Hezbollah yellow out here.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.095
- They run the city. If we tangle with them...
- You will bring him in. That's an order.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.410
Copy that.

05:33.260 --> 05:35.650
- Out the back.
- Thanks.

05:43.230 --> 05:45.190
Zero, one Hezbollah guard KIA.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.980
- Sorry. It was him or me.
- Roger.

05:48.005 --> 05:49.410
Bravo Two,
I'm out back.

05:49.420 --> 05:51.580
- Bravo One, target coming to you.
- Yeah. Roger.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.130
Target acquired.

05:59.140 --> 06:01.450
- Get the target back here.
- Roger.

06:01.510 --> 06:02.930
Let's move.

06:03.300 --> 06:04.990
What kept you?

06:13.030 --> 06:14.710
Down those stairs. Move.

06:25.621 --> 06:27.121
Fuck!

06:32.150 --> 06:34.420
Zero, we're taking
fire. Exit's no good.

06:41.050 --> 06:42.780
Bravo three,
we're falling back.

06:43.380 --> 06:45.380
Copy that.
I'm circling around.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.730
- Stand up! Stand up! Shit. Scott.
- Fuck.

06:54.030 --> 06:56.230
Target's been gut-shot.
He's never gonna make it.

06:58.270 --> 07:02.200
- You're prepped for a field interrogation. - In the
fucking van, not here. We're under heavy fire.

07:02.610 --> 07:05.190
- You will interrogate the prisoner.
- Shit.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.390
Oi, look at me.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.840
The Scotsman's name
is Leatherby, right?

07:12.660 --> 07:14.460
What's he being paid for?

07:15.800 --> 07:17.930
Shit. Armed x-rays
entering the building.

07:19.410 --> 07:22.605
OK. See this? See this account?

07:22.990 --> 07:25.980
Those are your transactions,
paid for by the CIA.

07:26.710 --> 07:29.000
- That is not mine. - Not?
- You forged them.

07:30.610 --> 07:33.130
You see this? See, this is your
passport, proof of travel

07:33.160 --> 07:35.620
between the United States
of America and Israel.

07:35.860 --> 07:37.440
I'm dying.

07:37.860 --> 07:40.090
Zero, this guy's
not gonna talk.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.770
Put the papers in his pocket.

07:45.390 --> 07:47.150
- Fuck.
- Shit.

07:47.190 --> 07:49.630
Tell him Hezbollah
will take his family.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.510
Fuck.

07:56.190 --> 07:57.510
Shit.

07:57.620 --> 08:00.230
They find these on you,
they're gonna kill your family.

08:02.540 --> 08:03.920
Make a choice.

08:04.930 --> 08:07.060
Mikey, we got some
action downstairs.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.970
Mike, come on.
We got to move.

08:18.180 --> 08:20.370
Hey, come on.
We got to move, Mike.

08:21.530 --> 08:25.250
You destroy the papers,
I tell you what you wish to know.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.140
Move!

08:31.950 --> 08:33.360
Come on.

08:55.900 --> 08:59.040
- We're really ready to be picked up
right now. - You're not finished.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.360
- Find me something concrete!
- Scott, your lighter.

09:02.570 --> 09:04.050
She's fucking losing it.

09:04.055 --> 09:05.600
Throw me your lighter.

09:05.770 --> 09:08.540
- Fucking fine time to start smoking.
- Yeah. Great. Nice of you to care.

09:09.460 --> 09:10.810
Look.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.920
Bravo Three,
what's your position?

09:14.950 --> 09:16.680
Exfil, two minutes.

09:17.440 --> 09:19.310
Your family is safe. Talk.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.360
Allah forgive me.
This is for them.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.260
He's coming...

09:25.500 --> 09:27.060
from Syria.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.740
He's coming.
Leatherby's bringing him.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.490
Who? Who's coming from Syria?

09:33.600 --> 09:35.590
Who's Leatherby
bringing from Syria?

09:35.600 --> 09:36.800
Al-Zu...

09:37.160 --> 09:41.050
Al-Zuhari.
Al-Zuhari.

09:46.051 --> 09:47.451
Shit.

09:48.850 --> 09:51.220
Zero, Leatherby's
bringing in Al-Zuhari.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.440
<i>Al-Zuhari's coming in from Syria.
Did you get that?</i>

09:55.510 --> 09:57.610
<i>Al-Zuhari's coming in
from Syria.</i>

09:58.090 --> 09:59.830
I fucking knew it.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.336
PEREDELKINO, SOUTH WEST MOSCOW

10:29.650 --> 10:31.349
I am sorry

10:32.050 --> 10:34.158
for your loss my friend.

10:41.489 --> 10:44.588
Viktor was a good son.

11:02.350 --> 11:05.425
My sources say
they are British Military.

11:12.190 --> 11:14.350
Do what has to be done.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.595
- Oi, where the fuck is Dalton?
- Not now.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.490
- What do you mean, not now?
- You saw what happened out there.

11:42.491 --> 11:44.277
- She nearly got us killed.
- No. I'm on your side.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.320
It's true. Yeah. It's true, all right?
But she also got us Al-Zuhari.

11:47.770 --> 11:50.740
- Yeah, and what happens if he's lying, Michael?
- He wasn't lying.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.610
You want to be fucking right.
You hear me?

11:55.810 --> 11:57.620
I had no choice.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.290
A street battle in
Daheih in broad daylight?

12:00.660 --> 12:03.685
<i>How do you expect to operate effectively
with Hezbollah breathing down your neck?</i>

12:04.160 --> 12:06.270
Please tell me you got
something to show for this mess.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.390
Amir gave us Al-Zuhari.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.900
He's coming into
the city from Syria.

12:13.020 --> 12:16.035
Well, if Al-Zuhari's moving, then whatever
he's planning must be happening soon.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.370
James Leatherby's bringing
him across the border.

12:18.410 --> 12:20.340
<i>We need to know
time and location.</i>

12:20.900 --> 12:23.289
Well, assuming your intel's good,
what's your next move?

12:23.330 --> 12:26.640
- Kamali is supposed to pay him.
- Let him.

12:27.170 --> 12:29.290
You know that
I don't trust Kamali.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.770
Listen, Rachel, Kamali's
the best thing we've got.

12:32.230 --> 12:34.840
You let him make the payment,
see what he can get us,

12:34.950 --> 12:38.430
<i>and, Major, we've lost enough men.
Don't make me come back to Beirut.</i>

12:52.990 --> 12:54.560
<i>I can guarantee you...</i>

12:54.860 --> 12:56.490
<i>What happens if
he's lying, Michael?</i>

12:56.492 --> 12:58.460
<i>...Al-Qaeda did before 9/11.</i>

12:58.680 --> 13:00.840
<i>We get Kamali, we
get Al-Zuhari himself.</i>

13:00.870 --> 13:03.810
<i>This is a systematic
cleansing of the... Al-Zuhari.</i>

13:29.910 --> 13:31.610
What happened
out there today

13:32.330 --> 13:33.860
was a mess.

13:33.940 --> 13:36.210
I told you I could handle it.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.870
Your people should
never have been there.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.610
Amir was my contact on
the operational side.

13:43.800 --> 13:48.380
- If you don't let me do things my way...
- Al-Zuhari is being brought in from Syria.

13:50.710 --> 13:53.340
That can't be true.
You're sure?

13:54.490 --> 13:56.360
Leatherby's the courier.

13:58.860 --> 14:00.880
I need to know
where and when.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.360
I am just the money man.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.510
Well, then do your job.

14:05.910 --> 14:08.830
Take Leatherby his payment and
find out what I need to know.

14:10.030 --> 14:13.650
- The moment I start asking questions...
- You'll do as I say.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.050
I meet him at
his casino, yeah...

14:23.750 --> 14:26.690
Apres La Guerre,
tomorrow morning, 3 A.M.,

14:27.250 --> 14:29.560
pay him in uncut diamonds.

14:29.690 --> 14:31.120
That's it.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.640
You'll wear a wire.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.550
And have my cover blown?

14:37.610 --> 14:41.660
I don't give a shit what
the chain of command want

14:42.890 --> 14:44.500
or what the CIA believe.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.165
If you're playing us,
I'll have you castrated

14:48.200 --> 14:51.030
before I see another
one of those men hurt.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.160
You're out of control, Major.

14:58.110 --> 15:02.280
For the record, it's you, not me,
that's gonna get your people killed.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.660
You hate me, don't you?

15:17.820 --> 15:19.450
- James...
- Don't.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.990
Just one of a long
line of bastards, aren't I,

15:26.340 --> 15:28.020
men that come out here

15:29.390 --> 15:32.430
and moan about the
heat and the dust

15:33.980 --> 15:36.240
whilst taking whatever
the fuck they like.

15:36.940 --> 15:38.400
The English...

15:38.960 --> 15:42.790
The English like to bang on
about the fucking Empire

15:43.510 --> 15:45.200
and the glory days,

15:45.360 --> 15:48.230
and yada, yada, fucking yada,

15:49.270 --> 15:51.510
but it was us
Scots who found it,

15:51.900 --> 15:54.360
took it, and held it for them.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.110
Why?

15:58.080 --> 16:00.860
We love these faraway places,

16:02.910 --> 16:05.070
these faraway people.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.420
Can't help ourselves.

16:21.430 --> 16:23.780
Have you got anything to tell me?

16:25.330 --> 16:26.670
Anything at all?

16:32.130 --> 16:34.165
Ex-SAS, operating out of Beirut

16:34.200 --> 16:38.130
since the late Nineties,
smuggles weapons, drugs, dirty money.

16:38.550 --> 16:40.410
Yeah. We know all that.

16:40.470 --> 16:42.820
Before Iraq, this guy's
record was impeccable.

16:43.950 --> 16:45.650
Oh, yeah? So was mine.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.090
I just want to know
what went wrong,

16:48.600 --> 16:50.730
what turned that man
into this man.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.130
Come on, Mike.

16:53.370 --> 16:56.980
Young people change,
sometimes for good...

16:57.980 --> 17:00.070
sometimes bad.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.750
During the first Gulf War,
he was operating behind Iraqi lines,

17:04.010 --> 17:07.690
where he was captured and tortured
by officers of the Republican Guard.

17:09.010 --> 17:11.010
Yeah. Maybe that's it.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.025
<i>Zero, we are in position,
no visual on target.</i>

17:36.030 --> 17:38.000
<i>I repeat, no visual on target.</i>

17:38.005 --> 17:39.770
Place your bets.

17:49.340 --> 17:51.360
<i>Leatherby in play.</i>

18:05.290 --> 18:06.890
AWOL, soldier?

18:08.050 --> 18:11.620
- Lucky escape.
- Ah, Tommy this, Tommy that.

18:12.060 --> 18:14.170
How's your fucking soul, huh?

18:14.500 --> 18:16.920
But here's the thing,
my bright-eyed friend.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.590
A killer is a killer,

18:19.780 --> 18:22.250
and a man may escape
many things...

18:24.440 --> 18:26.050
but never himself.

18:27.220 --> 18:29.430
You and I have had the
same fortune cookie.

18:31.890 --> 18:34.330
All good soldiers
are bound for hell.

18:35.160 --> 18:38.240
It's just that some see
it, and others don't.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.990
Whit's fur ye'll no go past ye.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.170
Cheers.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.230
Bring some wine.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.900
You want some work, Heh.

18:57.540 --> 18:59.080
you give me a call, eh...

19:01.840 --> 19:03.460
or give me a call, anyway.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.430
No more bets. No more bets.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.210
Cheers.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.440
You want a drink?

19:27.350 --> 19:29.090
No, thanks. I got one.

19:30.980 --> 19:34.280
- You want to buy me one?
- I would love to, but I can't.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.880
Call me.

19:44.090 --> 19:45.590
<i>No more bets.</i>

19:48.330 --> 19:50.080
<i>Kamali in play.</i>

20:13.880 --> 20:15.620
Just to be careful.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.350
Killed my first
man with a knife...

20:25.010 --> 20:26.710
Argentinean conscript.

20:27.690 --> 20:29.480
It was so fucking cold,

20:30.330 --> 20:32.620
<i>the blood froze on the blade.</i>

20:34.450 --> 20:36.050
Imagine that.

20:37.210 --> 20:39.880
Seventeen years later,
I'm lying in bed,

20:39.915 --> 20:42.020
I roll over...
wait...

20:43.350 --> 20:46.915
and the bastard is there
lying next to me, smiling at me,

20:48.300 --> 20:51.170
just fucking smiling at me.

20:52.350 --> 20:54.480
It's always the soldiers
that have the nightmares,

20:54.750 --> 20:57.070
<i>they send in to do
all the filthy work.</i>

20:57.520 --> 20:59.770
No blood under your fingernails,

21:00.850 --> 21:02.440
or is there?

21:03.200 --> 21:05.600
Heard a lot of men
died in Colombia, Leo.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.000
Do you have them?

21:27.590 --> 21:30.550
The other half once the
package is safely delivered.

21:32.260 --> 21:34.410
I need to know when and
where it's coming in.

21:35.620 --> 21:38.300
Why would you want
to know that?

21:42.060 --> 21:43.580
Don't push it. Come on.

21:44.870 --> 21:47.170
<i>Because I've been told
to make arrangements.</i>

21:48.810 --> 21:53.730
No offense, James. You're just a fucking
delivery boy peddling old war stories.

21:54.410 --> 21:56.340
Tell me what I need to
know... there's a good boy...

21:57.020 --> 21:59.610
or I'll see you never
work for Al-Zuhari again.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.270
Sit.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.700
Think you scare me?

22:16.760 --> 22:18.220
Really?

22:18.690 --> 22:20.390
Why the gun?

22:22.550 --> 22:24.200
Emphasis.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.900
- Asset's compromised. - Zero,
are we gonna pull him out, or what?

22:31.030 --> 22:34.170
- Leave him in play.
- Yes, ma'am.

22:34.710 --> 22:36.360
- Buy me in.
- Yes, sir.

22:57.410 --> 23:00.760
<i>Leo, this was a matter
between me and my boy.</i>

23:05.500 --> 23:08.240
- A fucking barman?
- No. It's nothing!

23:09.570 --> 23:12.960
I see your face in here
again, I'll cut it off.

23:15.470 --> 23:18.200
- Sorry.
- For fuck's sake. - No, no, no, no!

23:20.200 --> 23:21.690
Oh, God!

23:23.850 --> 23:26.020
Now it's nothing.

23:30.810 --> 23:33.570
Leo, I just wanted you to know

23:34.180 --> 23:36.920
what I feel about betrayal.

23:40.270 --> 23:42.020
He's just a friend.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.310
You belong to me.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.190
- Best get that seen to.
- No!

23:54.430 --> 23:58.950
You want to get yourself killed, go ahead.
I'm through. I'm done. I'm out.

24:02.170 --> 24:03.620
We've got him.

24:06.590 --> 24:09.550
Eyes on the boyfriend.
Looks like he took a bullet.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.580
Bring him in.

24:18.710 --> 24:21.080
Get in, or I shoot the other one.

24:23.990 --> 24:25.570
What?
Wha...

25:12.490 --> 25:14.730
Kamali, put that gun down.

25:16.260 --> 25:18.290
What the fuck
are you doing here?

25:26.440 --> 25:27.780
Dad.

25:31.098 --> 25:33.955
Amma, everything is fine.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.695
Take Ester and go
back to your room.

25:36.730 --> 25:39.190
- Dad, what is going on?
- Ester, please.

25:39.430 --> 25:43.600
Go with Amma
back to her room now.

25:47.550 --> 25:51.450
Kamali, I need you to come
down here and give me that gun.

26:27.450 --> 26:29.130
You got a spare?

26:31.900 --> 26:34.410
Oi, how old are you?

26:35.080 --> 26:37.230
What are you, my mom?

26:39.390 --> 26:41.040
Eh, he just looks like one.

26:42.450 --> 26:44.630
So how do you two know my dad?

26:46.980 --> 26:48.680
Eh, it's kind of a long story.

26:49.420 --> 26:51.220
I get it. I'm young.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.270
The Clash, huh?

26:54.120 --> 26:55.840
Got a favorite album?

26:55.850 --> 26:59.130
"London Calling," And don't
try and change the subject.

27:01.350 --> 27:04.150
- How about you, ma?
- Sex Pistols.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.130
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:07.100 --> 27:08.980
I would've taken you
as a Wham kind of guy.

27:08.985 --> 27:11.150
Andrew Ridgely is
hugely underrated.

27:13.990 --> 27:16.430
So you got it pretty
together for a,

27:16.540 --> 27:18.530
what,
thirteen-year-old?

27:18.540 --> 27:22.070
Don't tell me. You used to know a kid
who was just like me,

27:22.080 --> 27:24.660
and it was...you.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.280
Come here.
Give me that.

27:26.290 --> 27:28.700
- Who do you think you are?
- Smoking will kill you.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.240
You're really good
with kids, aren't you?

27:34.250 --> 27:35.990
Been there and done that.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.745
We should have a talk.

27:41.750 --> 27:44.165
I told you, I'm
done, leaving...

27:44.200 --> 27:46.580
his place, this city, all of it.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.215
Your commanding officer
just shoved me into a room

27:51.220 --> 27:54.160
with a delusional sociopath
and a list of questions

27:54.165 --> 27:56.660
guaranteed to fuel
his fucking paranoia.

27:57.250 --> 28:00.046
Anyway, it's not just about me.

28:00.501 --> 28:02.280
I have to think of Ester.

28:08.480 --> 28:12.550
If Hezbollah found out you
and Leatherby were lovers, you'd be dead.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.620
If you help me, I will help you.

28:18.481 --> 28:20.621
Nobody can help me.

28:20.860 --> 28:24.260
We can get you a visa,

28:24.590 --> 28:26.720
a new life, some money.

28:27.190 --> 28:28.788
And in return, you can tell us

28:28.790 --> 28:33.200
when and where Leatherby's
going to be bringing Al-Zuhari over the border.

28:33.310 --> 28:34.565
I can't.

28:34.570 --> 28:37.540
Then I'll just have to tell
Hezbollah that you're a manyook,

28:37.910 --> 28:39.960
but before Hezbollah know,

28:40.520 --> 28:43.610
I'll make sure your
father hears of your shame.

28:49.930 --> 28:51.370
Answer it.

28:59.610 --> 29:00.980
Yeah. What is it?

29:03.448 --> 29:04.982
Come home.

29:10.140 --> 29:11.640
So you decide.

29:27.850 --> 29:32.830
There's an air field
just outside Kefraya.

29:33.650 --> 29:35.270
James uses...

29:37.470 --> 29:40.590
and they will come
tomorrow at noon.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.250
So where would you go?

29:53.100 --> 29:56.620
There are options.
I always planned to get out.

29:56.970 --> 29:59.530
Nobody can live this
kind of life forever.

29:59.730 --> 30:02.630
You must have plans for
the future, a way out.

30:03.140 --> 30:04.850
Is that before somebody
pushes us to our knees

30:04.885 --> 30:06.560
and puts a bullet in
that back of our head

30:06.565 --> 30:09.565
- like you did with Baxter?
- Michael...

30:14.180 --> 30:16.400
Would it have been
the first time

30:16.520 --> 30:19.690
that you'd killed the wrong
person for the right reason?

30:22.570 --> 30:26.550
I'm not gonna pretend I understand
or even like a man like you.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.130
You need to finish
what you started.

30:31.240 --> 30:35.438
Easy for you to say.
What do men like you have to lose?

30:37.060 --> 30:39.140
What I had, I lost.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.110
Was it worth it?

30:57.960 --> 31:03.550
If I come back, what about Dalton?

31:04.150 --> 31:06.020
She's a liability.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.390
Yeah.

31:11.020 --> 31:13.030
We got your back on that, Leo.

31:19.850 --> 31:22.890
File from the CIA didn't
mention anything about a kid.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.730
And I'll appreciate it if
we could keep it that way.

31:29.990 --> 31:31.340
All right.

31:32.230 --> 31:34.220
What happened to her mother?

31:34.240 --> 31:35.630
She died.

31:38.750 --> 31:40.310
I'm sorry.

31:41.610 --> 31:43.710
We'll get you through this, Leo.

31:47.790 --> 31:49.130
Ok.

31:50.780 --> 31:52.930
Now get the fuck out of my house.

32:08.990 --> 32:12.235
We'll set up an armed support towards
the south side of the airstrip.

32:12.570 --> 32:14.290
- If you look at the map...
- Ok.

32:14.295 --> 32:15.750
What's all this?

32:16.170 --> 32:18.700
- And?
- Kamali's still in.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.400
- We have intel.
- The boyfriend talked.

32:24.410 --> 32:27.410
Leatherby's bringing Al-Zuhari
in through this airfield.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.880
So that's what we're going in on,
the boyfriend's word?

32:30.220 --> 32:32.330
- We could run it past Kamali.
- No.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.290
Ma'am, does Colonel Locke
know about this?

32:37.325 --> 32:40.000
Locke will be briefed post-op.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.570
What's your fucking
problem with Kamali?

32:42.910 --> 32:45.680
We all know what he
did and why he did it,

32:45.700 --> 32:48.880
but the truth is, you're the one
that put Baxter in front of that gun.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.630
How do you think a man like
Leo Kamali survives, hmm?

32:56.970 --> 32:58.340
It's simple.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.520
He sells himself as
whatever you need him to be...

33:04.200 --> 33:06.640
CIA asset, terrorist,

33:08.220 --> 33:09.770
money launderer.

33:11.110 --> 33:14.310
So what the fuck were you buying
today, huh, new best friend?

33:16.330 --> 33:18.400
This is a one-shot deal.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.670
We screw up, and
Al-Zuhari is gone,

33:22.470 --> 33:25.100
and we don't see him
again until it's too late.

33:27.850 --> 33:29.970
So are you in, or you out?

33:30.070 --> 33:32.850
Ma'am, what time's
that plane land?

33:33.470 --> 33:35.030
Tomorrow at noon.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.600
Gonna see my shrink.

33:54.970 --> 33:56.250
Pleased you called me.

34:02.710 --> 34:04.420
You have girl at home?

34:04.570 --> 34:06.210
No girl...

34:11.110 --> 34:12.590
and no home.

34:15.050 --> 34:16.510
Sad story.

34:16.540 --> 34:20.350
Maybe there's happy
ending for you and me, huh?

34:21.260 --> 34:23.639
- Yeah.
- You like that, tough guy?

34:24.600 --> 34:27.429
So you work out of here? Beirut?

34:27.465 --> 34:29.146
- I'm artist.
- Ha, ha, ha!

34:29.614 --> 34:31.130
No laugh. I prove.

34:31.989 --> 34:33.320
Yeah.

34:34.770 --> 34:36.830
See? Artist visa.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.770
To dance and take
clothes off is not easy.

34:39.804 --> 34:42.960
So, Katya Sergeyevich Tarasov,

34:44.389 --> 34:46.710
how come you're
so far from home?

34:47.530 --> 34:50.310
I borrow some money
to set up business.

34:51.230 --> 34:53.750
Big mistake. Bad man.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.740
How you say?
Don Corleone?

34:57.750 --> 34:59.400
Mafia.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.510
So I dance, save money
to pay him back,

35:03.920 --> 35:05.250
or he break legs.

35:05.260 --> 35:07.710
- How much?
- $10,000.

35:08.020 --> 35:09.760
Fucking lot of dancing.

35:11.580 --> 35:13.290
I like to dance.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.950
I like my legs.

35:18.330 --> 35:21.825
Yeah. I do, too.

35:21.860 --> 35:24.480
I will see you?
Where you stay?

35:25.140 --> 35:26.950
Heh. I'll call you.

35:29.310 --> 35:31.450
See you around, sexy legs.

36:18.630 --> 36:20.340
Zero, approaching position,

36:20.440 --> 36:22.830
<i>one click from Kefraya airstrip.</i>

36:38.290 --> 36:39.920
Let's do this.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.860
Shit.

37:00.460 --> 37:02.410
We're on. Target
convoy approaching.

37:02.445 --> 37:06.105
- Four SUVs heading your way.
- Roger that. I'm in position.

37:06.140 --> 37:08.320
I can see your sorry ass from here.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.440
- I have eyes on you.
- Yeah. I see you, too.

37:14.990 --> 37:17.280
Bird is circling to land.

37:19.290 --> 37:21.255
Bravo One
 I have eyes on the bird.

37:21.290 --> 37:23.420
<i>I repeat, I have eyes
on the bird.</i>

37:46.170 --> 37:47.550
Shit.

37:57.090 --> 37:59.830
Bravo Two, I got eyes
on Leatherby.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.970
I have multiple X-rays.

38:08.330 --> 38:10.730
Yeah. I got someone
stepping off that bird now.

38:11.900 --> 38:13.660
It's impossible to I.D. him.

38:14.060 --> 38:17.670
- Bravo One, report.
- That's a negative on an I.D.

38:19.740 --> 38:22.010
I have no clear shots
on X-rays.

38:22.410 --> 38:24.190
Moving for a better visual.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.120
- Bravo One, come in.
- What the fuck is that?

38:40.240 --> 38:41.915
Bravo One, come in. Mike.

38:41.950 --> 38:44.460
Foxhound, this is Sunray.
Cover our exfil. Over.

38:46.180 --> 38:47.410
Move!

38:51.560 --> 38:53.240
Bravo One?

38:54.650 --> 38:56.270
Mike, you all right?

38:57.600 --> 38:59.460
- Fuck.
- Shit.

38:59.820 --> 39:01.860
Zero, Leatherby
has the target.

39:01.895 --> 39:04.100
Repeat, Leatherby
has Al-Zuhari.

39:06.360 --> 39:07.870
Bravo One, come in.

39:07.900 --> 39:09.390
Ow! Shit.

39:11.810 --> 39:15.600
- Bravo One...
- Mike, you all right?

39:15.635 --> 39:17.990
I'm fine. I'm on the move.

39:28.750 --> 39:30.460
Cut across!

39:34.280 --> 39:36.470
I got you. Stop
running like a girl.

39:38.390 --> 39:41.040
- OK. Go, go, go, go.
- Good? - Yeah. I'm OK. I'm good.

39:41.220 --> 39:44.715
- You drive like a pussy. Move.
- Bravo Four on the move. - Copy.

39:44.740 --> 39:46.930
Bravo team. Target
heading south of airfield.

39:46.965 --> 39:48.507
Copy that. Coming to you.

39:48.512 --> 39:49.990
Coming up on our two o'clock.

39:52.300 --> 39:53.680
Goddamn it.

39:58.130 --> 39:59.640
Hold on.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.065
- Scott, did you see that?
- What?

40:04.070 --> 40:05.740
Fucking sign that said, "Mines."

40:05.750 --> 40:08.010
- What should I do? Should I slow down?
- No. Keep going.

40:11.550 --> 40:14.360
There's no mines here, Mike.
It must be an old sign.

40:16.130 --> 40:17.770
Nope. Maybe they missed one.

40:17.785 --> 40:20.040
- Go faster. Go faster.
- All right, all right, all right.

40:24.060 --> 40:26.055
- Fuck!
- Nope. Maybe it's two.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.750
Getting us off here,
all right?

40:29.140 --> 40:31.200
Bravo One,
what is your position?

40:32.010 --> 40:33.420
Ah, there they are.

40:42.290 --> 40:45.460
Just get up alongside. There you go.
Have that, mates.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.330
Fuck.

41:01.230 --> 41:04.100
You have to take Al-Zuhari alive.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.450
Shit.

41:20.070 --> 41:22.380
Scott! Yo, I'm out of ammo!

41:24.020 --> 41:25.380
Scott!

41:27.590 --> 41:28.990
Changing!

41:31.790 --> 41:34.890
Bravo One is taking fire.
No visual on target.

41:39.620 --> 41:41.880
- Scott!
- What?

41:41.915 --> 41:43.250
Moving!

41:44.350 --> 41:45.675
Fuck!

41:45.680 --> 41:47.860
That's our target vehicle!

41:50.920 --> 41:52.520
Confirm target.

41:55.290 --> 41:57.090
That's a negative.
It's a female.

41:57.125 --> 41:59.200
Negative. It's a female.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.330
Shit.

42:01.350 --> 42:04.170
Al-Zuhari is not here.
I repeat, not here.

42:13.040 --> 42:16.345
<i>Well, if Al-Zuhari's moving, then whatever
he's planning must be happening soon.</i>

42:16.375 --> 42:18.470
<i>Please tell me you got
something to show for this mess.</i>

42:19.590 --> 42:21.130
Bring her in.

42:21.165 --> 42:22.670
Scott! Moving!

42:23.320 --> 42:24.620
Move!

42:25.400 --> 42:26.585
Come on.

42:26.587 --> 42:28.525
<i>You and I got the
same fortune cookie.</i>

42:28.560 --> 42:30.370
<i>I need to know when and
where it's coming in.</i>

42:30.390 --> 42:35.200
Aah! James, get me out!
It's gonna blow! Hey!

42:35.270 --> 42:37.880
James! James, help!

42:39.110 --> 42:40.480
Go, go, go, go, go!

42:44.740 --> 42:46.740
Go, go, go! Let's go!

42:48.910 --> 42:52.540
Fucking traitor! Find me Kamali.

43:07.720 --> 43:11.135
OK. OK. Follow my voice. Stand up.
Turn your back against...

43:11.370 --> 43:12.920
Fuck, This is fucking bullshit.

43:12.930 --> 43:15.340
- I need you to stand up...
- I've done nothing wrong.

43:16.160 --> 43:17.860
- OK. Move forward.
- Where...

43:18.100 --> 43:20.100
Quiet. Be quiet.

43:20.450 --> 43:22.670
My father is Tareq Abboud.

43:24.350 --> 43:26.920
My name is Sofia Abboud.
My father is Tareq Abboud.

43:26.955 --> 43:29.460
- I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't
be here. - Take her downstairs.

43:29.530 --> 43:31.700
- Please. This is a terrible mistake.
- Move forward.

43:31.710 --> 43:33.340
- No, please!
- It's alright.

43:36.130 --> 43:37.825
He's a businessman.
He paid to get me out of Syria.

43:37.860 --> 43:40.240
Bullshit, come on.
Who are you, really?

43:41.020 --> 43:43.790
- Stand down, Major.
- What the fuck?

43:43.960 --> 43:46.985
- Will you take this woman
somewhere else, please? - Sir.

43:47.020 --> 43:48.510
Please...

43:54.790 --> 43:56.930
Colonel, I believe
that woman to be...

43:56.965 --> 43:59.420
Is exactly who she said she is.

44:00.240 --> 44:04.355
Her father was Assad's
finance minister until 2007.

44:04.390 --> 44:07.360
It was rumored that he might
provide al-Zuhari with funding,

44:07.500 --> 44:09.740
but that's it.

44:09.960 --> 44:11.520
She has to be a courier.

44:12.560 --> 44:15.700
You know that they use women
and family members to carry messages.

44:15.701 --> 44:16.585
I know.

44:16.587 --> 44:19.720
She'll be processed,
just not by you.

44:23.720 --> 44:25.830
You sent me on this operation.

44:27.350 --> 44:29.870
I've been undercover
for three months. Baxter...

44:35.150 --> 44:37.080
You can't take this
away from me, Philip.

44:38.910 --> 44:41.640
If Al-Zuhari had
been on that plane...

44:44.970 --> 44:46.640
But he wasn't, was he?

44:49.290 --> 44:52.170
You're taking
unjustifiable risks, Rachel.

44:52.900 --> 44:54.595
You're making bad calls.

44:54.630 --> 44:57.310
It's only a matter of time
before someone else is killed.

45:06.180 --> 45:08.160
You can't fucking do this.

45:08.170 --> 45:10.520
Major, consider yourself
on extended leave,

45:10.555 --> 45:12.310
effective immediately.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.370
OK. Listen up.

45:40.790 --> 45:44.040
As of this moment, I'm taking
direct command of this unit.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.500
Sir. Sir.

46:15.470 --> 46:18.030
OK, Sofia. Let's talk.

46:18.450 --> 46:20.490
Oh, Jesus Christ.

46:26.460 --> 46:30.090
We're gonna take a drive,
and then we're gonna talk,

46:30.125 --> 46:33.720
and as we do, I want you
to bear one thing in mind...

46:33.970 --> 46:37.470
I have absolutely nothing to lose.
