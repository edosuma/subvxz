EXCUSE ME, SLOOPS.

15:13.208 --> 15:16.083
WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU DON'T

15:13.208 --> 15:16.083
LIKE THE NAME COUCH?

15:16.125 --> 15:17.750

15:17.792 --> 15:19.041
-MORAN, I'M GOING TO

15:17.792 --> 15:19.041
TELL YOU A STORY

15:19.083 --> 15:21.083
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE.

15:21.125 --> 15:24.375
WHEN I WAS A KID I HAD A LISP.

15:24.417 --> 15:26.834
ONE DAY MY TEACHER ASKED ME HOW

15:24.417 --> 15:26.834
I FELT ABOUT MY DAD GOING

15:26.875 --> 15:28.375
OFF TO WAR.

15:28.417 --> 15:33.917
AND I SAID, "MS. SIMMONS, I'M

15:28.417 --> 15:33.917
REALLY SAD." I MEANT TO SAY

15:33.959 --> 15:36.792
SAD BUT IT CAME OUT THAD.

15:36.834 --> 15:40.250
AFTER THAT ALL THE KIDS STARTED

15:36.834 --> 15:40.250
CALLING ME THAD.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.083
AT FIRST I HATED IT.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.417
EVERY DAY I WAS HUMILIATED.

15:44.458 --> 15:46.792
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT

15:44.458 --> 15:46.792
I DECIDED TO DO?

15:46.834 --> 15:47.792
-WHAT?

15:47.834 --> 15:50.625
-I DECIDED TO OWN IT.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.583
I STARTED CALLING MYSELF THAD.

15:53.625 --> 15:54.750
WHY?

15:54.792 --> 15:56.583
BECAUSE SCREW EVERYONE

15:54.792 --> 15:56.583
ELSE, THAT'S WHY.

15:56.625 --> 15:57.750
-DAMN, RIGHT.

15:57.792 --> 16:01.959
-AND THAT DECISION MADE

15:57.792 --> 16:01.959
ME WHO I AM TODAY.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.291
-SO WHAT WAS YOUR REAL NAME?

16:03.333 --> 16:08.834
-KEVIN, BUT DON'T YOU

16:03.333 --> 16:08.834
EVER CALL ME THAT

16:08.875 --> 16:12.792
BECAUSE I AM THAD.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.125
-ALL RIGHT.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.667
ALL RIGHT.

16:20.709 --> 16:23.667
SO I BANGED A COUCH

16:20.709 --> 16:23.667
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

16:23.709 --> 16:24.500
BIG DEAL.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.500
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:26.542 --> 16:29.000
IT FELT GREAT.

16:29.041 --> 16:32.291
AND I CAME.

16:32.333 --> 16:33.917
I ONCE HAD SEX WITH

16:32.333 --> 16:33.917

16:47.583 --> 16:52.959

18:45.125 --> 18:46.083
-WHAT?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.250

18:55.333 --> 19:00.959

19:22.375 --> 19:24.291

19:22.375 --> 19:24.291

19:30.375 --> 19:32.500
