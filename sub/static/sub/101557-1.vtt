WEBVTT

01:55.673 --> 01:57.040
Dammit!

01:57.108 --> 01:57.942
First day.

02:17.728 --> 02:18.562
What'd you do?

02:18.628 --> 02:19.629
Excuse me.

02:19.697 --> 02:21.397
What are you seeing
the principal for?

02:21.465 --> 02:22.231
Vandalism?

02:22.299 --> 02:23.933
Smoking pot in the boys room?

02:24.001 --> 02:25.868
Bring a weapon to school? What?

02:25.936 --> 02:28.539
No, it's personal.

02:28.605 --> 02:29.873
Ooh, personal.

02:31.675 --> 02:32.975
Wait.

02:33.043 --> 02:34.578
You're the new kid, aren't ya?

02:34.645 --> 02:35.778
Busted.

02:35.846 --> 02:37.046
Tonya Michaels?

02:37.114 --> 02:39.717
Consider me the
welcoming committee.

02:39.783 --> 02:40.651
Follow me.

02:42.485 --> 02:44.887
So what brings you
to Willow Falls?

02:44.955 --> 02:47.124
Kinda late in the
year, don't you think?

02:47.191 --> 02:48.292
Well, my parents split.

02:48.359 --> 02:50.027
My mom's a nurse and
this is the only place

02:50.093 --> 02:51.527
that she could find work.

02:51.594 --> 02:52.663
Meaning what?

02:52.729 --> 02:54.064
Huh?

02:54.131 --> 02:55.998
What are you implying? This
place is just some shit hole?

02:56.066 --> 02:57.167
- No, no, I...
- Not good enough for you?

02:57.234 --> 03:00.070
I didn't mean that
it was some shit hole.

03:00.137 --> 03:01.405
Relax.

03:01.472 --> 03:02.674
I'm just fucking with ya.

03:04.842 --> 03:05.977
Welcome, new fish.

03:07.110 --> 03:09.612
You got some major balls
coming to this town.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.548
Most of us just wanna
get the hell out.

03:11.615 --> 03:12.884
Yeah, why is that?

03:25.028 --> 03:27.031
It's a pleasure
being your tour guide.

03:29.199 --> 03:30.067
Before I forget.

03:42.479 --> 03:43.347
Mr. Mitchell.

03:44.581 --> 03:47.617
We pride ourselves on
punctuality at this school.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.120
Ain't that right, Ms. Michaels?

03:51.855 --> 03:53.956
I was just
showing him the way.

03:54.024 --> 03:55.192
That's sweet of you.

03:55.258 --> 03:56.626
Class.

03:57.627 --> 03:58.495
Now.

04:09.173 --> 04:11.509
Look, I know why you
called me down here.

04:13.009 --> 04:14.844
Maybe we should talk
about this in private.

04:14.912 --> 04:16.913
There's not really
much to talk about.

04:20.918 --> 04:23.388
I talked to your
principal at your old school

04:24.822 --> 04:25.822
about what happened.

04:26.824 --> 04:28.158
Past is the past.

04:28.225 --> 04:30.127
And sir, I'd really appreciate
if we could keep it there.

04:30.194 --> 04:30.860
I hear you.

04:32.028 --> 04:33.531
Let's talk about it anyway.

04:34.732 --> 04:35.600
After you.

04:43.607 --> 04:44.509
Nice office.

05:12.235 --> 05:13.437
Damn!

05:16.206 --> 05:17.475
Hey, honey.

05:18.576 --> 05:20.677
I didn't know you would be home.

05:20.744 --> 05:22.113
My shift ends at 10.

05:22.980 --> 05:24.213
Oh!

05:24.281 --> 05:25.516
Yeah.

05:25.583 --> 05:26.250
Right.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.587
How was your first shift?

05:30.653 --> 05:31.687
It was okay.

05:31.754 --> 05:33.925
Listen, I really need
to get some sleep.

05:34.925 --> 05:36.293
Can you and Patrick-

05:36.360 --> 05:37.761
- TJ!

05:37.827 --> 05:39.129
He works at the bank.

05:40.129 --> 05:42.665
He took me to Dairy Queen.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.901
He's a really, really nice guy.

05:44.968 --> 05:46.838
You're really gonna like him.

05:47.870 --> 05:49.473
Can you do me a favor, hun?

05:50.374 --> 05:54.011
When you meet him,
could you call him, dad?

06:02.752 --> 06:03.620
Okay.

06:04.721 --> 06:05.589
Goodnight.

06:07.925 --> 06:12.930
Night.

06:30.079 --> 06:31.248
Swing the hammer.

06:33.884 --> 06:35.852
Challenge the strong man.

06:35.918 --> 06:37.120
Swing the hammer.

06:41.024 --> 06:41.691
Pussies.

06:42.959 --> 06:44.760
Challenge the strong man.

06:44.827 --> 06:46.729
Swing the hammer.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.702
Three in a row is a winner.

06:52.769 --> 06:53.936
Okay. Okay.

06:54.004 --> 06:55.605
Bon Jovi, that's enough.

06:55.673 --> 06:57.274
Come on over, that's enough.

06:57.341 --> 06:58.240
You're not a winner?
You're a loser.

06:58.307 --> 06:59.175
Take off.

07:03.312 --> 07:05.216
So what are your
friends? Carnies?

07:06.283 --> 07:07.151
Funny.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.286
Let me guess.

07:09.353 --> 07:11.153
In your old town,
you and your friends

07:11.221 --> 07:14.091
got drunk in the McDonald's
parking lot and did wheelies.

07:21.230 --> 07:22.699
Top that, bitches.

07:26.836 --> 07:28.404
What's up, babe?

07:28.471 --> 07:30.774
I was wondering
when you'd get here.

07:30.841 --> 07:31.709
Fuck off.

07:33.110 --> 07:36.812
I decided to drag the new kid
out to have some fun with us.

07:36.879 --> 07:38.014
This is Chris Mitchell.

07:38.081 --> 07:39.951
Tonya does love her strays.

07:42.185 --> 07:43.120
This is Zack.

07:44.454 --> 07:46.824
He seems like a big jerk,
but then you find out, he is.

07:48.959 --> 07:50.360
You used to love jerking it.

07:51.394 --> 07:53.096
Now you jerk yourself.

07:54.764 --> 07:55.632
Shut up.

07:56.899 --> 07:59.269
You look like a laffy taffy
in that, you know that?

08:00.838 --> 08:02.338
What is it? A buck a piece?

08:02.406 --> 08:03.973
Yes, sir. Buck a piece.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.843
Three in a row, big time winner.

08:12.415 --> 08:13.283
Today, please.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.762
You got this.

08:29.132 --> 08:30.366
How about you, tough guy?

08:30.434 --> 08:31.302
Number three?

08:41.410 --> 08:43.846
- Jeez!
- Mr. Chuckles here is Brett.

08:43.913 --> 08:44.880
Nice to meet you.

08:44.947 --> 08:46.316
Yeah, you too.

08:46.383 --> 08:47.251
Cotton candy?

08:48.918 --> 08:49.952
Nah, I'm good.

09:11.475 --> 09:12.343
You know it.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.277
- Let's go.
- Cotton candy?

09:14.344 --> 09:15.011
Yeah.

09:18.248 --> 09:19.750
See you after the carnival.

09:26.523 --> 09:28.024
Come.

09:28.091 --> 09:29.025
Come, my friend.

09:30.494 --> 09:31.362
Come inside.

09:36.033 --> 09:36.901
Come inside.

09:38.034 --> 09:39.202
What do you want, man?

09:40.336 --> 09:41.403
What are your
future, my friend.

09:41.471 --> 09:42.471
Sit down.

09:42.538 --> 09:43.907
I'm not paying you.

09:43.974 --> 09:44.842
It's free.

09:47.043 --> 09:48.011
Yes.

09:49.111 --> 09:49.980
Your hand.

09:56.854 --> 09:57.722
Yes.

10:01.524 --> 10:04.560
There's a man from your past.

10:04.628 --> 10:06.930
You need to reconnect with him.

10:06.996 --> 10:09.065
What are you talking about?

10:13.870 --> 10:18.274
You will have a long and
prosperous life, my friend.

10:19.142 --> 10:20.411
Get off me, you freak?

10:21.611 --> 10:22.846
What's the hold up?

10:50.673 --> 10:52.108
You want some?

10:55.544 --> 10:56.880
Yeah, I didn't think so.

10:58.081 --> 11:01.351
The way you're drinking
that beer, like a pussy?

11:09.458 --> 11:10.894
All right, hand it over.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.826
We should do a toast to Laura.

11:44.226 --> 11:45.095
Bro.

11:46.229 --> 11:47.430
Dick move.

11:47.496 --> 11:48.331
What?

11:50.100 --> 11:50.935
Who's Laura?

11:51.969 --> 11:53.436
Tonya's little sister.

11:53.503 --> 11:56.273
Oh, you never mentioned
you have a sister.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.508
Had a sister.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.043
What happened?

12:01.644 --> 12:02.678
She went missing.

12:02.745 --> 12:04.213
Missing.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.282
We all know what happened.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.618
Edith Cranston got to her.

12:08.684 --> 12:09.685
What?

12:09.753 --> 12:13.123
She used to run
this daycare center.

12:14.457 --> 12:18.995
One day Laura was there and
then no one ever saw her again.

12:24.201 --> 12:24.802
Look, I don't want
to talk about that.

12:24.868 --> 12:26.269
It's okay, babe.

12:26.336 --> 12:28.004
It's not okay.

12:28.071 --> 12:29.306
It's never gonna be okay.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.543
Look, we can't
get her to confess,

12:33.710 --> 12:35.613
but we can make
that old hag suffer.

12:37.014 --> 12:38.315
Oh yeah.

12:38.381 --> 12:39.250
I'm feelin' it.

12:41.018 --> 12:43.153
I think it's time we
pay her another visit.

12:50.559 --> 12:53.128
Where are we going?

12:53.196 --> 12:54.431
It's an old tradition.

12:55.731 --> 12:56.966
You'll see.

13:00.470 --> 13:02.038
All right, Mr. Chuckles.

13:20.389 --> 13:24.595
So, fill me in on
this little tradition.

13:26.696 --> 13:27.463
You'll see.

13:27.529 --> 13:29.064
We're going to Cranston's.

13:29.131 --> 13:31.066
Cranston's? Why?

13:31.134 --> 13:34.269
We like to remind her
what kinda monster she is.

13:34.336 --> 13:35.337
Yeah?

13:35.404 --> 13:39.009
We flooded her
basement, cut her tires.

13:39.076 --> 13:42.111
One time we left flaming
shit on her porch,

13:42.178 --> 13:43.212
which is classic.

13:45.148 --> 13:47.951
And you know, she
really is a monster.

13:49.418 --> 13:51.053
- She's a witch.
- Bro.

13:51.120 --> 13:51.721
She is.

13:51.788 --> 13:52.656
Everyone knows it.

13:53.789 --> 13:54.658
Your sister.

13:56.393 --> 13:57.060
What happened?

13:58.160 --> 13:59.695
We don't know for sure.

13:59.763 --> 14:00.965
That's the hard part.

14:02.631 --> 14:03.967
On her birthday,

14:05.368 --> 14:07.071
she was at Cranston's daycare

14:09.339 --> 14:10.708
and she just never came home.

14:13.409 --> 14:15.144
The police questioned Cranston.

14:16.546 --> 14:18.983
They shut down her
daycare completely,

14:21.118 --> 14:22.686
but they never
found Laura's body.

14:27.657 --> 14:28.658
And that rich bitch,

14:29.960 --> 14:33.330
she hired a fancy lawyer
and just got away with it.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.034
I'm sorry.

14:40.269 --> 14:41.138
Me too.

14:45.307 --> 14:46.744
The police forgot about Laura.

14:49.211 --> 14:50.080
But we never did,

14:52.282 --> 14:53.617
and we won't let her either.

15:24.614 --> 15:25.482
For Laura.

15:27.216 --> 15:28.750
For Laura.

15:28.817 --> 15:29.819
For Laura.

15:42.731 --> 15:43.799
I'm sorry.

15:43.866 --> 15:46.135
Pussy.

15:46.202 --> 15:47.203
Move your ass.

15:50.472 --> 15:51.442
Oh, shit.

15:55.879 --> 15:56.813
Going somewhere?

15:58.648 --> 15:59.449
Yeah.

15:59.515 --> 16:01.184
So get the hell out of our way.

16:04.754 --> 16:07.423
This is my property,

16:07.490 --> 16:09.725
and you are trespassing.

16:11.727 --> 16:13.262
You're lucky my
husband is not here.

16:13.330 --> 16:16.266
He would shoot you
right where you stand.

16:16.332 --> 16:18.367
And there's a little
more blood on your hands.

16:23.873 --> 16:26.310
I am not going to be
run out of my own home.

16:28.245 --> 16:32.548
You can shatter my windows
and I will replace them.

16:34.551 --> 16:37.621
You can throw a dead
animal and I will bury it.

16:39.556 --> 16:41.724
You can slash my tires,

16:41.791 --> 16:43.826
I will get new ones.

16:46.696 --> 16:48.197
But I'm staying right here.

16:50.667 --> 16:51.668
You wanna know why?

16:52.534 --> 16:53.603
Do you wanna know why?

16:57.640 --> 17:02.578
Because as much as you
hate me, I hate you more.

17:03.279 --> 17:03.980
I hate you more.

17:04.047 --> 17:05.249
I hate you more.

17:06.650 --> 17:10.386
Then leave, 'cause
we're never gonna stop.

17:10.452 --> 17:12.655
Not until you leave or die.

17:13.722 --> 17:14.892
I'm not afraid of you,

17:17.460 --> 17:18.327
but you,

17:21.530 --> 17:24.835
you should be very,
very afraid of me.

17:34.411 --> 17:36.346
Where did you get
that necklace, Tonya?

17:47.757 --> 17:49.493
See you in hell,
you old woman.

17:51.027 --> 17:51.929
Yes, you will.

17:53.696 --> 17:55.331
And I'm gonna save you a seat.

18:00.869 --> 18:01.938
Now, get out.

18:36.439 --> 18:38.708
Oh my God.

19:22.684 --> 19:24.553
Penny for your thoughts.

19:29.992 --> 19:30.860
A penny.

19:32.828 --> 19:33.696
That's it?

19:39.067 --> 19:40.403
A kiss then.

19:47.509 --> 19:48.679
I'm trying to remember

19:51.213 --> 19:52.982
the adventures we had.

19:55.151 --> 19:56.320
The hopes,

19:58.555 --> 19:59.556
dreams,

20:05.561 --> 20:06.429
the children.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.903
But it's all gone.

20:18.141 --> 20:20.344
Edith, what are you...

20:27.483 --> 20:29.485
There's only darkness.

20:31.753 --> 20:32.855
Look at me.

20:37.894 --> 20:39.930
My dream was to be
with you forever.

20:43.500 --> 20:44.134
And I am.

20:46.502 --> 20:47.937
So I'm happy as a clam.

20:55.577 --> 20:56.413
Good.

23:02.171 --> 23:03.807
Are you okay, Chris?

23:05.741 --> 23:06.609
I'm fine, ma.

23:09.178 --> 23:10.580
You don't seem like yourself.

23:10.646 --> 23:12.147
Are you sure everything's okay?

23:20.056 --> 23:22.659
You know, if you need to
talk to someone, I'm here.

24:07.836 --> 24:08.704
Hey.

24:11.374 --> 24:12.308
Hey, you.

24:15.077 --> 24:16.680
I got your call.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.985
Haven't seen you at
school the last few days.

24:23.051 --> 24:24.319
I got worried.

24:24.386 --> 24:25.355
You got worried.

24:25.421 --> 24:28.124
Actually I was
a little worried.

24:32.394 --> 24:33.929
Are you okay?

24:33.996 --> 24:34.663
Not really.

24:38.734 --> 24:40.936
You do feel a little hot.

24:43.740 --> 24:45.674
Is this about Cranston?

24:50.413 --> 24:54.016
We were there the night she...

24:54.083 --> 24:55.352
- What if...
- What if what?

24:57.019 --> 24:58.319
I don't know, man.

24:58.386 --> 24:59.621
What if she had a heart attack?

24:59.688 --> 25:02.425
- What if we were the reason?
- We didn't do anything.

25:02.491 --> 25:05.961
And if anybody asks, you
keep your mouth shut.

25:06.028 --> 25:07.129
Or what?

25:07.195 --> 25:08.830
You're gonna throw a rock at me?

25:08.897 --> 25:10.231
You think you're such a badass?

25:10.298 --> 25:11.466
Well, I'm not some
little old lady

25:11.534 --> 25:13.035
you can just push around.

25:13.102 --> 25:13.769
I'm not afraid of you.

25:13.836 --> 25:14.937
Maybe you should be.

25:15.003 --> 25:17.238
Maybe you should come
up with a better line.

25:17.306 --> 25:18.408
Relax. Relax.

25:19.509 --> 25:21.176
You're both pretty.

25:23.311 --> 25:24.179
Hey.

25:33.855 --> 25:35.324
You're a good guy.

25:35.391 --> 25:36.926
I like that about you.

25:39.095 --> 25:39.962
You're sweet.

25:42.365 --> 25:43.298
She's gone.

25:45.334 --> 25:47.336
And the world is a
better place for it.

25:49.204 --> 25:51.840
Yeah, she was into
some dark stuff.

25:51.907 --> 25:52.507
I'm telling you, man.

25:52.575 --> 25:53.442
She was a witch.

25:57.346 --> 25:58.213
What?

25:59.080 --> 26:00.982
You saw how she was that night.

26:01.049 --> 26:02.051
Acting all crazy.

26:03.286 --> 26:04.153
Fucking witch.

26:05.221 --> 26:06.221
It doesn't matter.

26:10.526 --> 26:11.461
She's dead.

26:13.296 --> 26:14.798
And we can't change that.

26:17.066 --> 26:17.933
And we,

26:20.036 --> 26:20.903
we're alive.

26:22.505 --> 26:24.974
We've got our whole
lives ahead of us.

26:26.375 --> 26:30.980
So we should just bury
the past and enjoy it.

26:33.382 --> 26:35.884
Hey, are we good?

26:38.988 --> 26:39.855
Yeah.

26:41.123 --> 26:41.990
I guess.

26:44.426 --> 26:45.294
Then say it.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.163
Tell me we're good.

26:51.601 --> 26:52.769
Yeah, we're good.

26:56.105 --> 26:56.971
We're good.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.884
Hey, you wanna play Pac-Man?

27:10.185 --> 27:11.987
I wanna play Pac-Man.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.581
Hello.

28:13.648 --> 28:15.116
Hello, Christopher.

29:16.679 --> 29:18.047
Come with me.

29:21.384 --> 29:22.251
Hold on.

29:23.286 --> 29:24.254
We're not going
anywhere with you

29:24.319 --> 29:26.121
until you tell us
why we're here.

29:27.355 --> 29:28.991
Patience is a virtue.

29:32.161 --> 29:34.430
We're not exactly the
virtuous type, old man.

29:53.449 --> 29:54.584
Have a seat.

30:19.575 --> 30:20.375
Tonya.

30:28.550 --> 30:29.418
Zack.

30:36.125 --> 30:36.992
Brett.

30:45.134 --> 30:45.969
And Chris.

30:50.573 --> 30:51.407
You must be new.

30:54.777 --> 30:55.644
Doesn't matter.

30:58.279 --> 31:00.115
I'm sorry to hear
about your wife.

31:04.653 --> 31:06.255
I'm sure you're heartbroken.

31:10.593 --> 31:11.727
And I know you all are

31:11.794 --> 31:15.131
because whose house are
you gonna terrorize now?

31:16.265 --> 31:17.733
Look, we don't
want any trouble.

31:17.799 --> 31:20.669
No one wants trouble.

31:22.872 --> 31:25.407
Sometimes it just finds them.

31:25.473 --> 31:27.775
Look, enough with
the small talk.

31:27.843 --> 31:28.745
What do you want?

31:33.182 --> 31:34.384
Tonya, Tonya.

31:39.888 --> 31:41.522
If I got what I wanted, Tonya,

31:41.589 --> 31:46.596
this meeting would be
a whole lot less civil.

31:50.766 --> 31:52.168
Edith was different.

31:53.736 --> 31:56.039
She was more forgiving.

31:58.874 --> 32:01.309
So it seems like she
surprised everyone

32:02.443 --> 32:04.579
when she included
you in her will.

32:07.316 --> 32:08.784
Bullshit.

32:08.851 --> 32:10.053
She hated us.

32:11.619 --> 32:12.788
That's what I thought.

32:16.959 --> 32:18.061
Yet, here we are.

32:22.932 --> 32:24.099
For what?

32:25.201 --> 32:26.068
Read.

32:27.202 --> 32:28.538
You can read, can't you?

32:30.638 --> 32:33.908
Or was your school too far
from your trailer park?

32:33.976 --> 32:35.577
We don't have to take this.

32:35.644 --> 32:36.511
Sit down.

32:41.317 --> 32:42.785
I don't want anything of hers.

32:44.385 --> 32:45.253
Really?

32:49.290 --> 32:52.760
Not even $100,000?

32:52.827 --> 32:55.263
Did you just say $100,000?

33:04.506 --> 33:06.240
What's the catch?

33:06.307 --> 33:07.175
Pardon me?

33:08.376 --> 33:10.244
With people like you,
there's always a catch.

33:10.311 --> 33:11.213
People like me.

33:14.817 --> 33:17.786
You don't know
anything about me.

33:17.853 --> 33:21.323
You don't know anything
about me or my wife.

33:21.390 --> 33:22.792
We know all we need to know.

33:25.394 --> 33:26.496
So you think.

33:28.297 --> 33:31.666
If you knew anything
about Edith,

33:31.733 --> 33:33.769
you'd know there was
one thing she liked.

33:34.936 --> 33:36.404
And that was to play games.

33:37.573 --> 33:38.441
I like games.

33:40.476 --> 33:41.544
What kind of game?

33:42.611 --> 33:43.746
Simple ones, really?

33:45.847 --> 33:48.151
Now, are any of
you superstitious?

33:50.818 --> 33:54.589
Not afraid of ghosts or things
that go bump in the night?

33:54.656 --> 33:56.891
I don't believe
in any of that shit.

33:56.959 --> 33:58.494
So the answer would be no.

33:59.494 --> 34:00.562
It's a no for me too.

34:01.963 --> 34:03.398
And what about you boys?

34:10.873 --> 34:11.673
Good.

34:11.740 --> 34:13.543
Well, the game's simple really?

34:15.643 --> 34:18.379
There's a phone
upstairs in the study

34:18.447 --> 34:19.582
at the end of the hall.

34:21.349 --> 34:24.920
All four of you must go
up there one at a time.

34:26.054 --> 34:27.556
There's a number
next to the phone.

34:27.623 --> 34:29.023
You call it.

34:29.090 --> 34:31.425
You stay on the
phone for one minute,

34:31.492 --> 34:32.862
you get $100,000.

34:35.396 --> 34:36.664
That's it?

34:36.731 --> 34:37.599
That's it.

34:38.666 --> 34:39.601
Easy as pie.

34:41.369 --> 34:42.438
Who are we calling?

34:44.806 --> 34:45.907
You're calling Edith.

34:55.617 --> 34:57.687
See, she had me bury
a phone with her.

34:58.987 --> 35:00.389
Okay, now that's crazy.

35:03.958 --> 35:05.894
Edith was always
a little eccentric.

35:06.961 --> 35:07.896
Wait, so all we gotta do

35:07.963 --> 35:10.832
is stay on the
phone for a minute?

35:10.898 --> 35:12.366
One minute.

35:12.434 --> 35:13.302
That's it.

35:14.635 --> 35:16.038
Then you exit out the back door

35:16.105 --> 35:19.507
and the money will be
yours in the morning.

35:19.574 --> 35:21.676
And what if we hang up early?

35:21.744 --> 35:23.045
Then your money will be split

35:23.112 --> 35:26.249
between the people
who stay on the call.

35:27.048 --> 35:28.750
I still call bullshit.

35:28.817 --> 35:30.452
I don't know what you're up to.

35:31.686 --> 35:33.087
Read the contract.

35:33.155 --> 35:34.189
It's all legal.

35:34.255 --> 35:36.757
Legal or not, I
don't want your money.

35:36.824 --> 35:38.260
Hey, speak for yourself.

35:41.429 --> 35:43.298
If I get this, we're set.

35:45.534 --> 35:46.635
Zack, there is no we.

35:47.702 --> 35:49.405
You gotta get that
through your head.

35:52.840 --> 35:53.808
And I'm outta here.

35:57.746 --> 35:58.814
Screw your game.

36:00.148 --> 36:03.585
Tonya, before you leave, dear,

36:06.121 --> 36:08.423
there's one more thing
I need to tell you.

36:09.958 --> 36:10.826
What?

36:11.860 --> 36:14.829
Edith's death was
not an accident.

36:17.432 --> 36:21.570
The paper was kind enough
to omit the details,

36:25.706 --> 36:27.309
but Edith killed herself.

36:31.447 --> 36:32.914
That sucks.

36:32.981 --> 36:34.650
What does it have to do with us?

36:36.918 --> 36:37.786
Everything.

36:42.190 --> 36:44.025
You see, she left
a suicide note.

36:45.494 --> 36:48.998
And in that note, she
made it very clear

36:50.898 --> 36:54.469
that your constant
threats to her,

36:54.536 --> 36:58.606
you and your little
friends over the years

36:58.673 --> 37:00.376
was more than she could bear.

37:03.478 --> 37:04.913
She was a strong woman,

37:06.614 --> 37:07.682
but she was depressed.

37:11.052 --> 37:12.853
And all those years of torture-

37:12.920 --> 37:13.654
- They were just pranks.

37:13.722 --> 37:15.091
They were pranks to you.

37:18.693 --> 37:20.362
They were devastating to her.

37:22.164 --> 37:23.032
Devastating.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.936
Then your little confrontation
with her the other night.

37:30.972 --> 37:32.574
That was the final straw.

37:32.641 --> 37:33.642
I was traveling.

37:35.978 --> 37:39.414
I wish to God I was
here, but I wasn't.

37:41.782 --> 37:43.117
She was all alone.

37:43.184 --> 37:45.920
She was afraid for her life.

37:54.195 --> 37:56.766
And she knew that not
one person in this town

37:58.300 --> 38:01.637
would protect her from
you or you or you.

38:03.204 --> 38:04.672
Oh God!

38:04.739 --> 38:05.373
I didn't even know her.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.509
But you were here.

38:07.576 --> 38:08.443
You saw it.

38:12.213 --> 38:13.081
Yeah.

38:15.918 --> 38:16.986
What are you saying?

38:21.255 --> 38:24.125
I'm saying, you let me
honor my wife's last wish

38:24.192 --> 38:25.527
by making the call.

38:31.266 --> 38:34.670
Otherwise, I'll go to
the police with the note.

38:37.606 --> 38:42.611
Make sure that you all
pay for what you did.

38:46.248 --> 38:48.983
I loved Edith more than life.

38:52.721 --> 38:53.989
Even more than revenge.

38:56.224 --> 38:58.027
That's why I'm
giving you a choice.

39:04.833 --> 39:06.601
Now, I'm gonna pour
myself a drink.

39:08.235 --> 39:10.071
When I get back, I
expect an answer.

39:27.755 --> 39:29.657
You guys aren't
seriously considering this,

39:29.724 --> 39:30.324
are you?

39:30.391 --> 39:31.259
Hell yeah.

39:32.393 --> 39:33.394
We may not wanna grow
up in the shit hole,

39:33.461 --> 39:36.063
we'll tell him about
this

39:36.130 --> 39:38.199
Right now I need this
money to get outta here.

39:42.371 --> 39:44.873
Crazy
as you say she is,

39:44.940 --> 39:47.041
I have to admit I've
seen stranger things.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.646
I can't get the
police on my tail.

39:51.780 --> 39:52.847
Why?

39:52.914 --> 39:53.782
You got a record?

39:55.851 --> 39:57.052
I just can't.

39:58.186 --> 39:59.721
A one minute phone call.

39:59.788 --> 40:01.222
There's four of us.

40:01.289 --> 40:04.026
We each call, we could
be gone in five minutes.

40:10.197 --> 40:11.533
So what's it gonna be?

40:15.971 --> 40:18.740
Do you make your call
or do I make mine?

40:21.309 --> 40:24.278
We're gonna do it, but
if you try anything...

40:24.346 --> 40:26.114
You don't have
to worry about me.

40:27.815 --> 40:29.617
I'll be outside
the back entrance

40:29.684 --> 40:31.686
waiting to greet you
when you're done.

40:32.820 --> 40:35.089
Just one of you can
go upstairs at a time.

40:36.391 --> 40:38.561
The rest of you have
to wait down here.

40:40.027 --> 40:41.696
Don't go snooping around.

40:45.867 --> 40:47.970
Once one of you has
completed the call,

40:50.038 --> 40:53.876
the Lira clock
upstairs, it will chime.

40:55.376 --> 40:57.779
Then the next person
can take their turn.

41:02.050 --> 41:03.318
Zack.

41:03.385 --> 41:05.588
You're such a tough
guy. You go first.

41:08.056 --> 41:11.994
Brett, you like following
your brother's footsteps.

41:13.128 --> 41:14.129
You'll be second.

41:15.996 --> 41:18.600
Chris, you follow Brett.

41:21.001 --> 41:23.837
Tonya, you'll make
the final call.

41:23.905 --> 41:24.873
Lucky me.

41:28.476 --> 41:29.344
So good.

41:30.411 --> 41:32.946
I know that Edith's
looking down on us.

41:33.014 --> 41:36.684
Smiling knowing that her
final wish has been granted.

41:39.954 --> 41:40.889
Once we're done with all this,

41:40.956 --> 41:42.691
we can put the
ugliness behind us

41:42.757 --> 41:44.092
and we can start to heal.

42:11.887 --> 42:14.757
Well, that wasn't
creepy at all.

42:16.157 --> 42:17.326
Hey, bro.

42:18.527 --> 42:19.827
It's just a phone call.

42:21.829 --> 42:22.998
I know that, dumb ass.

42:37.344 --> 42:38.212
Zack.

42:41.148 --> 42:42.016
Zack.

42:44.885 --> 42:47.355
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

42:47.422 --> 42:48.289
I'm fine.

42:50.291 --> 42:51.927
We're not all pussies like you.

43:23.023 --> 43:24.159
Let's do this.

44:35.963 --> 44:37.465
This house is whack.

46:35.282 --> 46:36.750
What the hell!

46:36.818 --> 46:37.686
Hello.

46:38.619 --> 46:39.753
Who is this?

46:39.820 --> 46:43.123
I'm so
glad you called.

46:43.190 --> 46:44.058
Okay.

46:45.159 --> 46:46.161
Fine, I'll bite.

46:47.195 --> 46:48.363
How're you doing this?

46:48.429 --> 46:51.164
Let's not waste
time with questions.

46:51.231 --> 46:53.101
Can you do me a favor?

46:54.369 --> 46:55.570
Yes ma'am.

46:55.637 --> 46:57.705
And what is it that
I can do for you?

46:57.771 --> 47:02.175
Be a dear
and look in the mirror.

47:33.807 --> 47:36.510
What the hell is this?

47:36.577 --> 47:41.583
You're
in my world now.

47:42.516 --> 47:43.384
You know what?

47:43.451 --> 47:45.119
The hell with this?

48:08.675 --> 48:10.444
Boys.

48:10.512 --> 48:11.612
Brett, get under the bed.

48:11.679 --> 48:13.247
No, Zack.

48:13.313 --> 48:14.414
I can't.

48:14.481 --> 48:16.483
There's monsters under the bed.

48:16.550 --> 48:17.351
Just do it.

48:17.418 --> 48:18.286
Come on.

48:30.532 --> 48:32.534
Unlock this damn door.

48:33.735 --> 48:35.369
How many times have I told you

48:35.436 --> 48:37.706
about locking the goddam
door in my house, huh?

48:40.407 --> 48:43.177
Oh, you're gonna
stand up to me now?

48:49.717 --> 48:50.585
Yeah.

48:51.585 --> 48:52.520
Let's see it then.

48:54.489 --> 48:56.324
Come here, you
little piece of shit.

48:58.458 --> 49:00.161
I'm not afraid of you.

49:00.228 --> 49:01.329
Are you a big man now?

49:02.630 --> 49:03.698
Yeah?

49:03.764 --> 49:04.766
Why don't you show me?

49:07.735 --> 49:08.737
Take your best shot.

49:16.610 --> 49:18.079
You're pathetic.

49:18.980 --> 49:19.847
Both of ya.

49:25.253 --> 49:25.987
Come on.

49:26.054 --> 49:28.222
You know what time it is.

49:32.659 --> 49:35.428
I don't know why you
make me do this to you.

49:55.416 --> 49:56.618
Zack.

50:00.621 --> 50:01.489
Zack.

50:19.373 --> 50:20.241
Zack.

52:18.626 --> 52:19.494
Zack.

52:20.927 --> 52:22.496
Zack, Zack, Zack.

52:24.632 --> 52:27.369
You know you cannot run from me,

52:28.469 --> 52:31.338
because I am always
gonna find you.

52:33.440 --> 52:34.308
Dad.

52:37.577 --> 52:38.445
You.

52:41.849 --> 52:44.352
So just like I thought.

52:44.418 --> 52:48.789
You are still too much
of a pussy to fight back.

52:49.690 --> 52:50.557
Dad...

52:54.661 --> 52:56.630
You're a complete
embarrassment, Zack.

52:58.565 --> 53:01.302
I'm embarrassed
to be your father

53:04.704 --> 53:07.574
I'm gonna give you
one last chance

53:10.844 --> 53:13.080
to hit me, you piece of shit.

53:15.682 --> 53:16.550
I can't.

53:18.920 --> 53:19.988
I'm sorry, I can't.

53:24.125 --> 53:27.762
You can't?

53:27.829 --> 53:28.697
I can't.

53:30.565 --> 53:31.566
It's okay.

53:35.836 --> 53:37.438
That's a good boy.

53:40.608 --> 53:42.943
I just wanna go home.

53:43.010 --> 53:44.512
It's all right.

53:45.880 --> 53:47.481
That's a good boy.

53:48.715 --> 53:50.817
You're gonna go home.

54:11.172 --> 54:12.706
Son of a bitch.

54:23.184 --> 54:25.452
What kinda door
doesn't have handles?

54:26.521 --> 54:27.855
He's taking too long.
I want my money.

54:27.922 --> 54:29.155
Simmer down.

54:29.222 --> 54:30.791
It's only been a few minutes.

54:32.159 --> 54:32.960
Yeah. Yeah.

54:33.027 --> 54:33.894
All right.

54:57.217 --> 54:58.985
It's my turn.

54:59.052 --> 55:01.955
- Wait.
- I am not pussy.

55:08.695 --> 55:11.731
If Zack can do it, so can I.

55:11.798 --> 55:12.867
See you when I'm rich.

55:18.105 --> 55:20.907
Hey, would you
mind holding this?

55:20.974 --> 55:22.242
Yeah, sure.

55:22.309 --> 55:23.445
You can have it if you want.

55:30.083 --> 55:30.951
Weird day.

55:35.121 --> 55:36.155
You're fine.

55:36.222 --> 55:39.827
You're not weak, and
you're not a pussy.

55:50.670 --> 55:51.538
Shit.

55:55.242 --> 55:56.577
It's just a phone call.

56:27.273 --> 56:28.141
Hello.

56:32.746 --> 56:35.716
Hey, I'm calling about my money.

56:37.083 --> 56:39.721
You've called
the right place, Brett.

56:43.157 --> 56:44.025
Mrs. Cranston?

56:45.760 --> 56:46.661
Yes.

56:52.132 --> 56:53.000
You're alive.

56:54.235 --> 56:55.235
Holy crap.

56:55.302 --> 56:56.938
So this is all a joke?

56:58.039 --> 56:59.206
Wait, so you faked your death,

56:59.273 --> 57:00.909
and now you're fucking with us?

57:02.309 --> 57:05.012
Fucking with you
was the last thing I wanna do.

57:06.079 --> 57:08.114
And speaking of fucking
with you, Brett,

57:08.181 --> 57:09.149
how's your daddy?

57:13.721 --> 57:14.688
What did you say?

57:18.291 --> 57:20.295
How's Harliss?

57:26.132 --> 57:27.201
Where are you?

57:27.268 --> 57:29.403
I'm everywhere,

57:29.469 --> 57:34.641
and that is the amazing
thing about being dead.

57:36.110 --> 57:37.778
The things you learn.

57:39.112 --> 57:41.047
The things you see.

57:41.114 --> 57:42.649
I don't know what
you're talking about.

57:42.717 --> 57:43.785
Really?

57:43.851 --> 57:48.789
I mean, I knew your
dad was a horrible man.

57:48.856 --> 57:50.324
The way he beat your brother,

57:50.391 --> 57:53.327
I can't imagine treating
a child with my likeness-

57:53.393 --> 57:54.261
- Shut up.

57:55.161 --> 57:56.195
Shut up.

57:56.262 --> 57:58.731
But you,
after his wife died,

57:58.798 --> 58:02.869
he started hurting you,
in unimaginable ways.

58:02.936 --> 58:03.904
I said, shut up.

58:07.942 --> 58:08.876
Do you remember

58:08.943 --> 58:10.211
your favorite
nursery rhyme, Brett.

58:12.246 --> 58:17.251
♪ Something very scary
is underneath my bed ♪

58:19.186 --> 58:22.624
Could it be a monster
underneath my bed?

58:26.427 --> 58:29.030
All you have to do
is stay on the call.

58:30.030 --> 58:30.898
And?

58:32.231 --> 58:35.402
Check to see if
the monster is under the bed.

58:36.903 --> 58:38.405
What bed?

58:38.472 --> 58:40.040
No, Zack.

58:40.106 --> 58:41.742
There's monsters under the bed.

58:41.809 --> 58:42.677
You can run but
you can't hide.

58:49.150 --> 58:50.251
How many times have I told you

58:50.318 --> 58:52.887
about locking the goddam
door in my house, huh?

58:55.222 --> 58:57.458
Oh, you're gonna
stand up to me now?

58:57.525 --> 58:58.693
Why don't you show me?

58:59.793 --> 59:01.828
Go ahead. Take your best shot.

59:06.000 --> 59:06.867
Pathetic.

59:07.867 --> 59:08.735
Both of ya.

59:22.983 --> 59:23.851
Zack.

59:43.003 --> 59:43.871
Zack.

1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:28.148
Son.

1:01:24.471 --> 1:01:25.940
She wants you.

1:01:27.708 --> 1:01:29.110
You're so sick.

1:02:47.521 --> 1:02:48.556
I'm not afraid.

1:02:54.061 --> 1:02:58.032
You're scared your
little friends can hear ya?

1:03:00.367 --> 1:03:01.969
You know why this happens?

1:03:03.603 --> 1:03:06.973
Because you're too weak
to do anything about it.

1:03:46.679 --> 1:03:48.048
Have you seen this?

1:04:04.097 --> 1:04:05.666
Don't tell me he
actually made it.

1:04:07.134 --> 1:04:09.702
I didn't hear
the back door open.

1:04:09.769 --> 1:04:10.637
Me neither.

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:14.307
But...

1:04:18.644 --> 1:04:19.579
It's your turn.

1:04:22.516 --> 1:04:23.384
All right.

1:04:24.485 --> 1:04:27.488
Weird or not, let's do this.

1:04:36.262 --> 1:04:37.630
See you on the other side.

1:04:40.367 --> 1:04:41.235
Hey.

1:04:46.539 --> 1:04:48.275
Good luck, new fish.

1:06:19.599 --> 1:06:20.768
Hello, Chris.

1:06:23.536 --> 1:06:26.272
So many secrets, so much pain.

1:06:28.541 --> 1:06:30.510
How do you handle it?

1:06:31.777 --> 1:06:32.779
Handle what?

1:06:51.864 --> 1:06:53.732
I love you.

1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:54.668
Me too.

1:06:58.938 --> 1:06:59.806
What's wrong?

1:07:04.811 --> 1:07:06.347
I wanna tell mom and dad.

1:07:10.016 --> 1:07:11.750
You're not having
second thoughts, right?

1:07:11.818 --> 1:07:12.886
No.

1:07:12.952 --> 1:07:14.221
No, I just...

1:07:15.688 --> 1:07:17.790
Can't we wait a little longer?

1:07:17.858 --> 1:07:18.826
What?

1:07:18.891 --> 1:07:20.094
Just until the
semester is over.

1:07:20.159 --> 1:07:23.563
We've got finals and that
big trip with my mom.

1:07:24.931 --> 1:07:26.900
She's gonna totally
flip when she finds out.

1:07:26.967 --> 1:07:27.901
She's gonna flip?

1:07:27.967 --> 1:07:29.768
My dad's gonna
ground me for life?

1:07:29.835 --> 1:07:31.270
He's probably gonna
make us get married.

1:07:31.338 --> 1:07:32.439
But you wanna do it?

1:07:33.940 --> 1:07:35.442
After we graduate.

1:07:38.711 --> 1:07:40.480
Look, this isn't
just about you.

1:07:41.581 --> 1:07:42.849
We didn't plan this.

1:07:46.485 --> 1:07:48.754
It's happening and we
have to deal with it.

1:07:48.822 --> 1:07:50.957
Bat can we just deal with
it whenever the time is right?

1:07:51.023 --> 1:07:51.924
Now.

1:07:51.992 --> 1:07:52.859
Now is the right time.

1:07:52.925 --> 1:07:53.960
I'm already showing.

1:07:55.795 --> 1:07:57.197
What am I supposed to do?

1:07:58.431 --> 1:07:59.500
Just wear baggy clothes
and just tell people

1:07:59.567 --> 1:08:01.300
I'm gaining weight till
you feel comfortable

1:08:01.367 --> 1:08:02.034
to tell your mom?

1:08:02.101 --> 1:08:03.702
No.

1:08:03.769 --> 1:08:05.206
Can we talk about this?

1:08:06.606 --> 1:08:09.776
There's nothing to talk about?

1:08:09.842 --> 1:08:13.545
I have to tell them, and if
you can't support me then...

1:08:13.612 --> 1:08:15.014
Sarah.

1:08:15.081 --> 1:08:16.682
Sarah, I...

1:08:16.750 --> 1:08:17.618
I do...

1:08:50.684 --> 1:08:52.686
What did you fucking do?

1:11:01.981 --> 1:11:03.117
Christopher.

1:11:05.618 --> 1:11:06.619
Christopher.

1:11:13.260 --> 1:11:14.994
Christopher Michael.

1:11:20.900 --> 1:11:21.769
Hey.

1:11:23.936 --> 1:11:25.572
Come, hold my hand.

1:11:49.895 --> 1:11:51.163
Listen, we don't have much time.

1:11:51.230 --> 1:11:52.565
We've gotta hurry.

1:11:53.667 --> 1:11:54.568
It's not over yet.

1:11:55.601 --> 1:11:56.836
I missed you so much.

1:11:58.572 --> 1:11:59.539
I missed you too.

1:12:00.673 --> 1:12:05.144
The way you got in is
the way you get out.

1:12:05.211 --> 1:12:06.713
What do you mean?

1:12:06.779 --> 1:12:07.680
Find the phone.

1:12:21.194 --> 1:12:22.062
I love you.

1:12:23.162 --> 1:12:24.030
Always.

1:12:29.234 --> 1:12:30.103
Now go.

1:12:31.136 --> 1:12:32.005
Go now.

1:12:32.905 --> 1:12:34.106
Find the phone.

1:13:03.302 --> 1:13:04.703
Brett.

1:13:04.770 --> 1:13:05.704
You're alive.

1:13:05.771 --> 1:13:06.838
What's happening?

1:13:06.905 --> 1:13:07.573
The phone.

1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:09.108
It's the only way out.

1:13:09.175 --> 1:13:10.777
I think I saw it this way.

1:13:10.844 --> 1:13:11.511
What are you talking about?

1:13:11.578 --> 1:13:12.646
The phone is right here.

1:13:16.783 --> 1:13:17.651
Brett.

1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:21.087
Brett.

1:14:00.694 --> 1:14:01.562
Tonya.

1:14:36.261 --> 1:14:37.130
Tonya.

1:17:41.046 --> 1:17:42.547
Everything ready?

1:17:42.614 --> 1:17:43.416
Yeah.

1:17:43.483 --> 1:17:44.484
They bought it.

1:17:44.551 --> 1:17:48.254
The contract, your
death, everything.

1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:49.454
Good.

1:17:49.521 --> 1:17:51.423
Two down, one to go.

1:17:53.192 --> 1:17:55.261
And once you take care
of the little slut,

1:17:56.462 --> 1:18:00.133
the money will be yours
just like I promised.

1:18:02.702 --> 1:18:03.570
Good boy.

1:18:33.166 --> 1:18:34.034
Tonya.

1:18:37.235 --> 1:18:37.903
I'm right here.

1:18:41.707 --> 1:18:43.342
Where is it, you bastard?

1:18:44.444 --> 1:18:45.978
Well, calm down.

1:18:46.045 --> 1:18:47.179
Where is the gun?

1:18:47.246 --> 1:18:49.547
The only gun I see is
the one you're holding.

1:18:49.614 --> 1:18:51.283
- Yeah, right.
- I came back for you.

1:18:51.350 --> 1:18:53.051
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:18:53.118 --> 1:18:53.987
Don't move.

1:18:55.387 --> 1:18:58.291
I saw you and Edith on the TV.

1:18:59.359 --> 1:19:00.459
You saw her?

1:19:00.525 --> 1:19:01.394
Yes.

1:19:02.295 --> 1:19:03.996
On the TV?

1:19:04.063 --> 1:19:04.864
Yeah.

1:19:04.930 --> 1:19:06.431
And I know what you're planning.

1:19:06.498 --> 1:19:08.134
I swear. I don't know what...

1:19:15.007 --> 1:19:15.876
Put the gun down.

1:19:18.077 --> 1:19:19.478
You're right.

1:19:19.545 --> 1:19:22.213
You saw Edith, but
she's not alive.

1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:25.417
She's something else.

1:19:27.185 --> 1:19:28.487
What?

1:19:28.554 --> 1:19:29.755
I know it sounds crazy.

1:19:29.822 --> 1:19:34.426
I know this all sounds
crazy, but there's no game.

1:19:35.228 --> 1:19:36.095
There's no money.

1:19:36.162 --> 1:19:37.496
The call.

1:19:37.563 --> 1:19:38.565
It's just a trap.

1:19:39.532 --> 1:19:41.100
It's just a trap.

1:19:41.167 --> 1:19:42.302
She tricked me.

1:19:43.569 --> 1:19:44.905
She tricked all of us.

1:19:49.641 --> 1:19:51.110
Where are Brett and Zack?

1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:56.149
They're dead.

1:20:01.186 --> 1:20:03.355
We've gotta get outta here.

1:20:15.568 --> 1:20:19.072
They were into some
really twisted stuff.

1:20:20.405 --> 1:20:24.344
When I made the call, it
was like I was transported.

1:20:26.479 --> 1:20:27.546
I don't understand.

1:20:27.613 --> 1:20:28.481
Where?

1:20:29.649 --> 1:20:33.086
Darkest reaches of my mind.

1:20:34.287 --> 1:20:35.721
I don't know.

1:20:35.787 --> 1:20:37.289
It's hard to explain.

1:20:40.225 --> 1:20:41.994
But what I saw there...

1:20:42.862 --> 1:20:44.363
But you're still here.

1:20:44.430 --> 1:20:45.265
You're alive.

1:20:46.698 --> 1:20:48.100
'cause I didn't give up.

1:20:53.706 --> 1:20:55.375
Maybe you should have.

1:21:03.416 --> 1:21:04.583
You all...

1:21:10.890 --> 1:21:14.127
You all took the only thing

1:21:15.228 --> 1:21:17.998
that I cared about
in this world.

1:21:22.335 --> 1:21:25.005
But we figured out a
way to stay in touch.

1:21:28.573 --> 1:21:29.576
The phone.

1:21:33.546 --> 1:21:35.515
Technology's a
wonderful thing.

1:21:37.416 --> 1:21:38.752
It can bring people together

1:21:39.685 --> 1:21:41.287
or it can tear 'em apart.

1:21:52.164 --> 1:21:52.798
Yes, dear.

1:21:55.635 --> 1:21:56.536
Yes, I know.

1:21:57.936 --> 1:21:59.439
The boy came back.

1:22:01.239 --> 1:22:02.274
It's a pity really?

1:22:07.512 --> 1:22:08.180
Yes, my love.

1:22:11.384 --> 1:22:12.751
She wants to talk to you.

1:22:12.818 --> 1:22:13.720
Fuck you.

1:22:17.323 --> 1:22:18.425
Get on the phone.

1:22:34.539 --> 1:22:36.676
We gotta get outta here.

1:22:38.211 --> 1:22:39.479
The door's open.

1:23:03.469 --> 1:23:04.369
Dammit.

1:23:04.436 --> 1:23:05.305
Dammit!

1:23:06.338 --> 1:23:07.805
There's an exit
in the call room.

1:23:07.872 --> 1:23:08.740
Go!

1:23:24.923 --> 1:23:25.792
Tonya.

1:23:27.493 --> 1:23:28.861
Tonya.

1:23:28.927 --> 1:23:29.796
Tonya.

1:23:31.264 --> 1:23:32.664
No, please.

1:23:38.304 --> 1:23:39.172
Tonya.

1:23:46.679 --> 1:23:48.581
Leave me alone.

1:23:48.648 --> 1:23:49.914
No.

1:23:49.981 --> 1:23:52.484
You should have left me alone.

1:23:52.551 --> 1:23:55.355
But you couldn't, could you?

1:23:56.822 --> 1:24:00.326
Because you needed
someone to blame.

1:24:00.393 --> 1:24:01.760
Shut up.

1:24:01.827 --> 1:24:04.329
Shut up, you fucking witch.

1:24:04.396 --> 1:24:06.431
So innocent, so pretty.

1:24:18.778 --> 1:24:19.646
Laura.

1:24:20.578 --> 1:24:21.447
Sit down.

1:24:23.515 --> 1:24:26.652
A little birdie told me
today is someone's birthday.

1:24:26.719 --> 1:24:28.654
For your special day,

1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:30.389
I got you something special.

1:24:31.323 --> 1:24:32.192
What is it?

1:24:51.644 --> 1:24:52.311
Tonya.

1:24:56.414 --> 1:24:58.016
Why are we going this way?

1:24:58.083 --> 1:24:59.251
It's a shortcut.

1:25:00.386 --> 1:25:02.454
Did you see what
Mrs. Cranston gave me?

1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:03.722
She said I was special.

1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:10.729
Yeah. Everyone
thinks you're special.

1:25:10.796 --> 1:25:12.731
So special.

1:25:14.899 --> 1:25:17.568
Hey, give it back.

1:25:17.636 --> 1:25:18.437
No.

1:25:18.503 --> 1:25:19.439
I'll tell dad.

1:25:21.039 --> 1:25:22.541
Tonya.

1:25:22.608 --> 1:25:24.476
Daddy's little girl.

1:25:25.744 --> 1:25:26.746
I hate you.

1:25:28.146 --> 1:25:31.751
She was his favorite
and you couldn't stand it.

1:25:34.453 --> 1:25:36.256
Now I'm daddy's little girl.

1:26:09.721 --> 1:26:10.590
Hello, Tonya.

1:26:15.961 --> 1:26:19.798
When I saw you wearing the
necklace that I gave Laura,

1:26:19.864 --> 1:26:21.768
I knew she was dead,
and I knew it was you.

1:26:25.438 --> 1:26:29.375
When they told us she was
missing and I was blamed,

1:26:29.442 --> 1:26:31.542
I died inside.

1:26:31.609 --> 1:26:34.145
The demons, they swirled
around me and I joined them.

1:26:34.212 --> 1:26:35.146
And they took me down,

1:26:35.213 --> 1:26:36.148
and they took me down

1:26:36.215 --> 1:26:37.583
and they took me down.

1:26:38.884 --> 1:26:41.686
Until nothing was left in
me but hatred and rage.

1:26:41.753 --> 1:26:43.756
And you know what's
so interesting?

1:26:44.722 --> 1:26:46.457
You're in the same boat.

1:26:46.524 --> 1:26:48.460
You and your stupid
little friends,

1:26:48.527 --> 1:26:49.328
you're all gonna suffer,

1:26:49.395 --> 1:26:51.497
and you're gonna die violently

1:26:51.564 --> 1:26:52.899
with your own hatred
and your own rage.

1:26:55.734 --> 1:26:58.137
Please, leave me alone.

1:26:58.203 --> 1:26:59.537
Oh, you don't have to worry.

1:26:59.604 --> 1:27:01.340
You are very alone.

1:27:02.740 --> 1:27:05.577
There's a special place in
hell for you, little girl.

1:27:05.644 --> 1:27:06.878
Do you know what hell is?

1:27:06.945 --> 1:27:08.947
There's a special place for you,

1:27:09.014 --> 1:27:11.083
and it's not what
the good book says.

1:27:11.149 --> 1:27:13.117
It is not fire and brimstone.

1:27:13.185 --> 1:27:14.953
It's reliving your
worst nightmares

1:27:15.020 --> 1:27:16.989
over and over and over.

1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:35.668
Tonya.

1:28:37.569 --> 1:28:38.970
Come play with me.

1:28:46.979 --> 1:28:47.847
Tonya.

1:28:49.148 --> 1:28:50.750
Come play with me.

1:28:57.655 --> 1:29:00.859
I told you we'd be
together forever.

1:29:15.006 --> 1:29:15.907
Tonya.

1:29:15.975 --> 1:29:16.843
Tonya.

1:29:46.704 --> 1:29:47.840
Mrs. Cranston.

1:29:54.412 --> 1:29:55.646
What do you want?

1:29:55.713 --> 1:29:57.248
Vengeance.

1:29:57.315 --> 1:29:59.117
I'm sorry.

1:29:59.184 --> 1:30:00.918
I'm so sorry.

1:30:00.985 --> 1:30:03.855
You're not sorry
about anything.

1:30:05.157 --> 1:30:07.159
Certainly not about me.

1:30:07.225 --> 1:30:08.193
My husband.

1:30:15.934 --> 1:30:17.869
You're in my world now.

1:30:25.877 --> 1:30:27.112
Christopher.

1:30:27.179 --> 1:30:28.313
Sarah.

1:30:28.380 --> 1:30:29.649
Why'd you leave me?

1:30:30.381 --> 1:30:31.048
Why?

1:30:32.917 --> 1:30:35.286
I was coming right back.

1:30:35.354 --> 1:30:36.222
Liar.

1:31:30.141 --> 1:31:31.610
Hello.
