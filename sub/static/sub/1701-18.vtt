WEBVTT

00:02.168 --> 00:05.170
Oh, Drake.
I'm sorry, Amber.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.923
It's just like Brad to have
to have the last word.

00:08.967 --> 00:12.052
- I'm sorry I'm late. What happened?
- We wanna see the end.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.014
- I want you, Drake.
- I know you do.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.349
But you and I can never
be together that way.

00:17.976 --> 00:21.145
- What?
- There's something I never told you.

00:21.312 --> 00:24.231
I'm actually your half-brother.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.191
- What?
- Huh?

00:29.529 --> 00:31.196
So, what happens next?

00:31.364 --> 00:34.867
Well, I get the medical award
for separating the Siamese twins.

00:35.035 --> 00:39.329
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela
to meet our other half-brother, Ramon...

00:40.540 --> 00:44.334
...and that's where I find the world's
biggest emerald. It's really big.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.794
But it's cursed.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.007
- So cool!
- God, that is good TV.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.017
- Pheebs, play with me!
- No!

01:42.185 --> 01:43.560
This game is grotesque.

01:43.770 --> 01:47.689
Twenty armless guys joined
at the waist by a steel bar...

01:48.024 --> 01:51.276
...forced to play soccer forever? Ugh!

01:51.444 --> 01:53.654
Hello? Human rights violation.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.698
Don't feel so bad.
After they're done playing...

01:56.866 --> 02:01.036
...I break out the plastic women
and everybody has a pretty good time.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.248
Why don't you play with your roommate?

02:04.415 --> 02:06.041
Eh, he's, uh...

02:06.209 --> 02:08.168
He's not a big fan of foosball.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.130
Uh-oh. Ooh. Are we not getting along
with the new boy?

02:11.297 --> 02:15.259
No, he's all right. He just, uh,
spends most of his time in his room.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.053
Maybe because you haven't
taken time to get to know him.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.805
Let's remedy that, shall we?

02:20.140 --> 02:23.058
- We don't need to remedy that.
- Oh, yeah, it'll be fun!

02:25.645 --> 02:27.563
- What was that?
- Hi!

02:27.730 --> 02:30.482
Um, I thought it'd be fun
if the three of us had beers...

02:30.650 --> 02:32.192
...and got to know each other.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.487
- All right. That sounds all right.
- Oh, good! Okay.

02:35.655 --> 02:40.200
Oh, no, I have to go,
because I'm late for my, um...

02:40.368 --> 02:42.452
...Green Eggs and Ham
discussion group.

02:43.538 --> 02:47.541
Um, tonight, it's "Why he would not
eat them on a train."

02:48.042 --> 02:50.210
- Have fun! Bye!
- That was so lame.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.337
I know. Yeah, heh.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.798
- Okay, talk to him.
- Ahem.

02:57.844 --> 03:02.973
So you, uh, think that Speed Racer guy
gets a lot of tickets or?

03:05.059 --> 03:07.769
Ha-ha-ha. That's good.
So who broke up with who?

03:07.937 --> 03:09.688
You kidding? I broke up with her.

03:09.939 --> 03:13.525
She actually thought Sean Penn
was the capital of Cambodia.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.155
When everybody knows that
the, uh, capital of Cambodia is...

03:18.323 --> 03:20.115
Is, uh...

03:20.283 --> 03:22.534
It's not Sean Penn.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.995
All right, I got a funny one. All right?

03:25.163 --> 03:27.956
My last girlfriend, Tilly.
We're eating breakfast, right?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.500
I made these pancakes.
Like, 50 pancakes.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.837
All of a sudden,
she turns to me and says, "Eddie...

03:34.047 --> 03:36.048
...I don't wanna see you anymore."
Ha, ha.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.092
It was literally like she had
reached into my chest...

03:39.344 --> 03:42.679
...ripped out my heart
and smeared it all over my life!

03:43.848 --> 03:46.767
There was this incredible abyss
and I'm falling.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.728
I keep falling and
I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!

03:55.026 --> 03:57.027
That wasn't such a funny story, was it?

04:02.784 --> 04:05.285
And a crusty old man
Said I'll do what I can

04:05.453 --> 04:07.746
And the rest of the rats
Played maracas

04:10.416 --> 04:12.626
That's it! Thanks! Good night.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.463
- Phoebe's got another job, right?
- Heh.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.675
- Great set tonight, Pheebs.
- Yes.

04:19.841 --> 04:20.968
I know.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.887
- We should get going.
- Mm.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.848
We should too.
I've got patients at 8 in the morning.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.309
You know how we always stay
at your apartment?

04:29.560 --> 04:31.770
I thought tonight
we'd stay at my place.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.523
I don't know.
I don't have my jammies.

04:34.691 --> 04:35.857
Heh.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.359
You don't need them.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.445
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.282
Shut up. I'm happy.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.245
Oh, this is so nice!
I have to make a speech.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.788
Ahem. I just want to say...

04:49.956 --> 04:53.542
...of all the guys that Monica
has been with, and that is a lot...

04:55.878 --> 04:58.588
...I like you the best.
- Aw.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.425
Thank you, Pheebs.
That's very sweet.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.093
You hear that?

05:03.344 --> 05:06.847
She likes me best. And apparently,
there have been a lot.

05:08.599 --> 05:09.766
Not a lot.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.477
Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.023
Phoebe's dead.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.030
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.740
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.617
Oh, uh, he's not here right now.
I'm Chandler.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.704
Can I take a message or...
Or a fish tank?

05:30.913 --> 05:32.080
Thanks.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.957
Come on in.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.375
I'm Tilly.

05:40.506 --> 05:41.548
Oh.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.509
I gather by that "Oh,"
he told you about me.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.554
Yeah, your, uh, name came up...

05:47.805 --> 05:51.266
...in a conversation that
terrified me to my very soul.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.061
He's kind of intense, huh?

05:54.270 --> 05:57.064
Yes! Hey, can I ask you,
is Eddie a little...

05:57.273 --> 05:59.941
- A little what?
...bit country?

06:03.112 --> 06:04.404
Come on in, you roomie!

06:05.615 --> 06:06.907
Hello, Tilly.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.576
Eddie, I just came by
to drop off your tank.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.953
That was very thoughtful of you.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.705
It's very thoughtful.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.586
Well, okay then.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.255
I'm gonna go. Bye.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.132
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:26.677 --> 06:27.886
So we getting a fish?

06:28.513 --> 06:30.597
You had sex with her, didn't you?

06:33.101 --> 06:35.727
Pheebs! Check it out, check it out!

06:35.937 --> 06:40.065
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest!
That's one of my favorite digests!

06:41.567 --> 06:43.860
- Page 42! Page 42!
- Okay, okay.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.904
Okay. Ooh. Hey!

06:46.072 --> 06:48.949
"New Doc on the Block,
Days of our Lives Joey Tribbiani."

06:49.117 --> 06:51.618
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh, cool picture!

06:51.786 --> 06:54.037
- Ah.
- Oh, I look good.

06:55.706 --> 06:59.000
Is this true? That you write
a lot of your own lines?

06:59.669 --> 07:01.169
Well, kind of, yeah.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.340
Remember last week
when Alex was in the accident?

07:05.591 --> 07:07.384
The line in the script was:

07:07.593 --> 07:11.054
"If we don't get this woman
to a hospital, she's going to die."

07:11.305 --> 07:14.307
But I made it, "If this woman
doesn't get to a hospital...

07:14.517 --> 07:16.435
...she's not gonna live."

07:18.062 --> 07:21.523
Oh, okay.
I see what you did there.

07:24.026 --> 07:28.029
Aren't you afraid the writers will be
kind of mad when they read this?

07:28.239 --> 07:29.531
Huh.

07:29.699 --> 07:34.077
I never thought about the writers.
The scripts just come to my house.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.415
But you know what?

07:38.624 --> 07:42.043
This makes me look good,
which makes the show look good...

07:42.295 --> 07:45.964
...which makes the writers look good.
So how could they be mad?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.509
Makes up most of his lines.

07:49.719 --> 07:50.969
Son of a...

07:52.763 --> 07:55.724
Yeah. Write this, jerk-weed.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.684
I fall down an elevator shaft?

07:57.852 --> 08:00.854
What does this mean?
I fall down an elevator shaft?

08:01.063 --> 08:04.524
Uh, I don't know.
I just bring the scripts.

08:06.068 --> 08:09.488
They can't kill me!
I'm Francesca's long-lost son!

08:09.655 --> 08:11.740
Right.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.700
Uh, could you sign?

08:13.951 --> 08:16.870
No! No way! I'm not signing that!

08:17.038 --> 08:20.373
I don't think that's gonna affect
the plot of the show.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.793
How can they do this to me?

08:26.756 --> 08:29.132
All right, uh, I'm just gonna go.

08:29.842 --> 08:30.884
Sorry.

08:37.140 --> 08:39.226
Well, it wasn't that many guys.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.395
If you consider how many guys
there actually are...

08:42.772 --> 08:45.148
...it's a very small percentage.
- Hey.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.109
It's not that big a deal.
I was just curious.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.028
- Good night.
- Good night, Richard.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.113
Good luck, Mon.

08:52.323 --> 08:56.576
All right, before I tell you, uh, you tell me
how many women you've been with.

08:58.788 --> 09:03.041
- Two.
- Two? Two? Heh.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.460
How is that possible? I mean...

09:05.670 --> 09:07.754
...have you seen you?

09:08.923 --> 09:11.258
Well, I mean, what can I say?

09:11.467 --> 09:15.637
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,
my high-school sweetheart.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.806
Now you. That's two.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.809
- Two it is. Heh.
- Mm-hm.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.311
Okay, time for bed.
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

09:23.479 --> 09:26.022
Whoa, no, wait a minute now!

09:26.232 --> 09:27.983
Come on, it's your turn.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.026
Oh, come on!

09:31.279 --> 09:34.990
You know, I don't need the
actual number. Just a ballpark.

09:36.450 --> 09:39.494
Okay, it is definitely
less than a ballpark.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.710
Wow, I am so glad
I'm not Monica right now.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.670
Tell me about it.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.506
So, what's your magic number?

09:52.883 --> 09:54.050
Ahh...

09:54.218 --> 09:58.597
Come on, you know everyone
I've been with. All both of them.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.516
Well, ahem, there's you.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.768
Better not be doing these in order.

10:05.271 --> 10:09.024
Okay, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.859
- Ah.
- Barry.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.153
And, uh, oh, Paolo.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.531
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.953
Oh, honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

10:22.163 --> 10:25.790
I'm so much happier with you
than I ever was with him.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.043
- Really?
- Oh, please.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.296
That Paolo thing was
barely a relationship.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.216
All it really was
was just meaningless, animal sex.

10:39.305 --> 10:44.059
Okay, you know, that sounded
so much better in my head.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.437
Eddie! I didn't sleep with
your ex-girlfriend.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.899
That's exactly what someone
who slept with her would say.

10:51.067 --> 10:54.194
This is nuts! Crazy!
She came over for two minutes...

10:54.362 --> 10:56.738
...dropped off a fish tank and left!
End of story.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.366
- Where's Buddy?
- Buddy?

10:59.533 --> 11:01.159
My fish, Buddy.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.496
There was no fish
when she dropped it off.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.414
Oh, this is unbelievable!

11:07.166 --> 11:11.169
You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,
insult my intelligence by lying...

11:11.420 --> 11:13.338
...then you kill my fish?
My Buddy?

11:13.756 --> 11:15.382
I didn't kill your fish!

11:15.633 --> 11:17.425
Look, Eddie...

11:20.846 --> 11:23.056
Would you look at what I'm doing?

11:23.557 --> 11:25.058
Now that can't be smart.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.648
So we're just gonna
take this guy right off you...

11:31.857 --> 11:34.317
...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.737
Tangelo?

11:47.581 --> 11:50.709
That's it? That's the giant number
you were afraid to tell me?

11:50.876 --> 11:53.962
- Well, yeah.
- Well, that's not bad at all.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.881
You had me thinking it was,
like, a fleet.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.426
You're okay with it?

11:59.593 --> 12:01.344
Oh, honey, I'm fine.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.679
Oh, yay!

12:06.016 --> 12:07.892
Okay, about that two.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.394
What?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.603
All right.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.647
What about my two?

12:12.857 --> 12:15.483
It just seems like
a really small number.

12:15.693 --> 12:16.735
Right.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.362
- And?
- And, well...

12:19.572 --> 12:22.490
Don't you have a lot
of wild oats to sow?

12:23.200 --> 12:27.495
Or is that what you're doing with me?
Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

12:28.414 --> 12:30.123
Honey, you are not an oat.

12:30.374 --> 12:34.169
I don't know, I guess
I'm just not an oat guy.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.337
I've only slept with women I love.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.757
You've only slept with two people.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.430
Right.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.184
Wow.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.853
Oh, wow.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.856
You know I love you too, right?

12:55.733 --> 12:57.358
Now I do.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.989
Ugh, Ross!

13:03.157 --> 13:04.699
Ross, please listen to me.

13:04.867 --> 13:09.078
Ross, you are so much better for me
than Paolo ever was.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.373
You care about me, you're loving,
you make me laugh.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.918
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.

13:15.085 --> 13:18.588
Invite Paolo to have a romp in the sack,
and I'll stand in the corner...

13:18.756 --> 13:21.424
...and tell knock-knock jokes.
- Ross! Agh!

13:21.592 --> 13:24.010
God, Ross!

13:24.178 --> 13:27.263
What you and I have is special!
All Paolo and I ever had was...

13:27.431 --> 13:28.681
Animal sex, animal sex?

13:32.019 --> 13:33.686
So, what are you saying?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.815
There's nothing between us
"animal" at all?

13:37.066 --> 13:40.985
There's not even,
like, um, a little animal?

13:41.237 --> 13:42.821
Not even, like...

13:43.197 --> 13:44.447
...chipmunk sex?

13:46.492 --> 13:47.951
Okay, Ross...

13:48.202 --> 13:50.954
Try to hear me, okay?

13:51.121 --> 13:53.289
I... Hey. I'm not gonna lie to you.

13:53.916 --> 13:57.210
- It was good with Paolo.
- Knock-knock.

13:59.463 --> 14:02.423
But what you and I have
is so much better.

14:02.675 --> 14:07.011
We have tenderness,
we have intimacy, we connect.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.680
You know? I swear.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.015
This is the best...

14:11.267 --> 14:13.935
...I have ever had.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.522
- Until now.
- Aah!

14:22.278 --> 14:24.904
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.656
Richard told me he loved me.

14:26.907 --> 14:27.991
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

14:28.242 --> 14:29.576
Honey, that's great!

14:29.785 --> 14:30.994
- I know!
- Ha, ha.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.912
- I just can't find...
- Top drawer.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.206
- Hurry.
- Why? You need one too?

14:35.374 --> 14:37.792
Oh, yeah.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.336
- Found them!
- Whoo.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.258
There's only one.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.219
- Monica!
- Hi.

14:48.387 --> 14:52.473
Uh, we'll be right there.
We're just trying to decide something.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.395
Rachel?

15:08.073 --> 15:09.908
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.953
- They're trying to decide something.
- Good. Good, good.

15:20.252 --> 15:24.464
So is, um... So was your mustache...
Did it used to be different?

15:26.884 --> 15:28.718
- No.
- Oh.

15:31.555 --> 15:34.599
How do you, uh, you know,
keep it so neat?

15:36.560 --> 15:38.686
- I have a little comb.
- Oh.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.067
- What do you call that?
- A mustache comb.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.652
Thank you.

15:47.029 --> 15:50.865
Okay, I will do your laundry
for one month.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.242
- No!
- Okay, okay!

15:53.410 --> 15:55.078
I will, I will, I will...

15:55.287 --> 15:57.956
I will clean the apartment
for two months.

15:58.165 --> 16:02.460
I'll give this to you now, if you
tell me where we keep the dustpan.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.846
So were you in Nam?

16:18.477 --> 16:20.687
- Rock, paper, scissors?
- Gotcha.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.022
One, two, three.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.857
- Yes!
- Agh!

16:25.025 --> 16:28.319
- Ah!
- Fine. Go have sex.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.157
No! You have got it completely wrong!

16:33.325 --> 16:36.202
John Savage was Deer Hunter,
no legs.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.330
Jon Voight was Coming Home,
couldn't feel his legs.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.710
No, you've got it totally the other way
around, my friend. Jon Voight...

16:43.877 --> 16:45.712
- Honey? Ahem.
- What? Oh.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.806
- Shall we?
- It's not gonna happen.

16:57.057 --> 17:00.309
They're doing it tonight.
We can do it tomorrow.

17:02.646 --> 17:06.566
Uh, in the future, if I could see
the schedule beforehand...

17:10.362 --> 17:12.155
So when I woke up this morning...

17:12.364 --> 17:15.532
...he'd stolen all the insoles
out of my shoes!

17:15.701 --> 17:16.826
Why?

17:16.993 --> 17:20.872
He thinks I slept with his
ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.915
Why would you kill his fish?

17:26.336 --> 17:29.005
Because sometimes
after you sleep with someone...

17:29.256 --> 17:31.591
...you have to kill a fish.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.136
Chandler, honey...

17:35.387 --> 17:36.512
...I'm sorry.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.057
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?

17:39.224 --> 17:41.100
- Yeah!
- Wait. He's not here yet.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.603
He's on the show,
he knows what happens.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.231
I'm fine about my problem now,
by the way.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.694
Amber...

17:52.321 --> 17:54.739
...I want you to know
I'll always be there for you...

17:54.948 --> 17:56.991
...as a friend and as your brother.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.243
Oh, Drake.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.245
Hard day, huh?

18:01.497 --> 18:04.165
- First the medical award, now this?
- Yeah.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.668
- Some guys are just lucky, I guess. Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.504
Dr. Ramoray...

18:09.671 --> 18:12.381
...report to first floor Emergency stat.
- Hmm.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.884
Well, then...

18:15.677 --> 18:17.386
...l, uh, guess that's me.

18:19.848 --> 18:23.226
Anyone else need to go on the elevator?
Dr. Horton? Dr. Wong?

18:23.393 --> 18:26.479
No, no. They only said you.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.234
Oh, okay. All right.

18:31.401 --> 18:34.070
- I love you, Drake.
- Yeah, whatever.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.074
- Oh, no!
- Drake, look out!

18:42.704 --> 18:45.039
- Did they just kill off Joey?
- No!

18:47.459 --> 18:49.168
Now maybe.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.756
Come on! Open up!
We want to talk to you!

18:53.966 --> 18:55.424
I don't feel like talking!

18:55.634 --> 18:57.426
Come on! We care about you.

18:57.594 --> 19:01.889
- We're worried about you.
- And some of us have to pee!

19:06.061 --> 19:07.562
I'm sorry, Joey.

19:09.690 --> 19:13.151
Listen, sorry about your death.
That really sucks.

19:13.819 --> 19:17.155
- We came over as soon as we saw.
- How could you not tell us?

19:17.364 --> 19:21.117
I don't know. I was kind of hoping
no one would ever find out.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.329
Well, maybe they could find
a way to bring you back.

19:25.497 --> 19:31.002
No, they said that when they found
my body, my brain was so smashed in...

19:31.253 --> 19:34.839
...that the only doctor
who could've saved me was me.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.885
It's supposed to be
some kind of irony.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.555
But Joey, you're gonna be fine.

19:42.764 --> 19:46.184
You don't need that show.
It was just a dumb soap opera.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.562
This was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.398
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.986
Oh, good, here's Monica.
She'll have something nice to say.

19:58.405 --> 20:02.074
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain
so you won't get mildew.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.119
What? To me, that's nice.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.497
It's gonna be okay. You know that.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.750
No, I don't.

20:12.044 --> 20:15.338
It's like you work
your whole life for something...

20:15.589 --> 20:17.715
...and you think
that when you get it...

20:17.966 --> 20:20.301
...it'll never be
as good as you thought.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.261
But this so was.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.222
It changed everything.

20:24.431 --> 20:27.642
Like, the other day,
I got this credit card application...

20:27.893 --> 20:30.186
...and I was pre-approved!

20:31.730 --> 20:36.108
Huh? I've never been pre-approved
for anything in my life!

20:36.318 --> 20:37.860
I'm sorry, man.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.364
I don't know if this'll mean
anything to you...

20:41.573 --> 20:44.200
...but you'll always be
pre-approved with us.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.161
No, that means nothing to me.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.000
Ahh!

20:54.378 --> 20:56.254
Pecan sandy? Just made them.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.298
Yeah, all right.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.593
Are these raisins?

21:02.761 --> 21:04.220
Uh, sure, why not?

21:11.645 --> 21:13.813
Listen, Eddie. Um, ahem.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.858
I've been thinking about
our living situation and, uh...

21:18.026 --> 21:19.193
Why are you smiling?

21:19.361 --> 21:22.780
I got a little surprise.
Look. There's a new fishy.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.865
I named him, uh...

21:25.075 --> 21:27.618
...Chandler, you know, after you.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.547
Well, that's not even a real fish.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.301
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.846
So, what's your point, man?

21:51.018 --> 21:52.893
Okay, good night.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.230
You big freak of nature.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.206
- Aah.
- Hey.

22:18.628 --> 22:19.670
Hey.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.714
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:21.882 --> 22:25.217
- Whoo. Brisk tonight.
- Oh, man.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.763
- Let's never speak of this.
- You got it.
