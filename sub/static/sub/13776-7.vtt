WEBVTT

00:01.589 --> 00:03.589
No. That's one of the
amazing things about this

00:03.591 --> 00:05.591
place-- you can use the
furniture as actual furniture.

00:05.593 --> 00:07.593
- Go ahead, you should try it.
- This place is way

00:07.595 --> 00:10.138
- better than our house.
- You mean, my house.

00:10.258 --> 00:13.092
Yeah, this place is real...
dicey!

00:13.094 --> 00:15.027
What is that?
Holy shit.

00:15.029 --> 00:16.963
That's not comedy.
You need to take that stand-up

00:16.965 --> 00:19.131
class again, Andre.
I actually am taking that

00:19.133 --> 00:21.667
stand-up class again.
I failed the first time.

00:21.669 --> 00:23.669
But I think it'll be fun to be

00:23.671 --> 00:25.872
the fun doctor around the
office.

00:25.874 --> 00:28.274
Andre, you don't want to be
the funny doctor.

00:28.276 --> 00:30.276
The last car to go down that
road was Patch Adams.

00:30.278 --> 00:32.278
I beg to differ, and that's
why I hope you all join me at my

00:32.280 --> 00:34.480
stand-up comedy showcase.
Oh, no!

00:34.482 --> 00:36.883
Oh, God.
You have to go.

00:36.885 --> 00:38.885
Look, it's a bringer show.
If there's no one in the

00:38.887 --> 00:40.887
audience, I can't perform.
I got a lot bigger problems

00:40.889 --> 00:42.989
than Andre's shitty comedy show.
My buy-week issues are insane.

00:42.991 --> 00:44.891
That's right, you're coming
up against Pete-top,

00:44.893 --> 00:47.126
Kevin-bottom.
I don't give a shit about

00:47.128 --> 00:49.128
that. My players are amazing.
If I pick somebody up, I got to

00:49.130 --> 00:51.130
drop somebody really valuable.
I mean, what am I gonna do, drop

00:51.132 --> 00:53.299
Percy Harvin?
He's coming back.

00:53.301 --> 00:55.501
Don't want to drop him.
Mm-hmm.

00:55.503 --> 00:57.403
I think, at this point, the
smartest thing to do-- not pick

00:57.405 --> 00:59.839
up anybody.
What?

00:59.841 --> 01:02.041
I'm gonna start my team down
two players.

01:02.043 --> 01:03.976
Why?
It's kind of the ultimate

01:03.978 --> 01:05.878
move in fantasy disrespect.
I'm gonna play you with one hand

01:05.880 --> 01:07.680
tied behind my back.
And you're gonna lose.

01:07.682 --> 01:09.715
Am I, though?
Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna beat

01:09.717 --> 01:11.918
you.
Will you?

01:11.920 --> 01:13.920
Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna set
the lineup that's gonna knock

01:13.922 --> 01:15.922
you out of the park.
Will it?

01:15.924 --> 01:18.024
Yeah, 'cause I'm not gonna...
Oh, you think you're gonna make

01:18.026 --> 01:19.859
me overthink this?
It's interesting to think

01:19.861 --> 01:21.827
about.
Well, I'm not going to, okay,

01:21.829 --> 01:23.930
'cause I know I'm gonna win even
when you have your...

01:23.932 --> 01:26.098
I don't know what game you're...
It's not a... I'm fine. I...

01:26.100 --> 01:28.100
I'm not spending any extra time
on this, you're not gonna mess

01:28.102 --> 01:30.102
with my head.
Won't I?

01:30.104 --> 01:32.171
You're not.
Hey, I like your lamp.

01:32.173 --> 01:34.867
It's like a big old dick!
What was that?

01:34.987 --> 01:35.839
That's a joke.

01:35.959 --> 01:40.943
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:41.063 --> 01:44.303
So, Jenny, the philosophy
behind our investment club is to

01:44.423 --> 01:47.858
empower women.
We are very particular about who

01:47.860 --> 01:50.260
we let into the Lucrative Ladies
Club.

01:50.262 --> 01:52.729
Yes, very particular.
We're looking for women who

01:52.731 --> 01:55.365
are... impressive.
You could be impressive.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.868
- You might be impressive.
- I would <i>love</i> to be

01:57.870 --> 02:00.070
impressive.
Okay, and there's also a

02:00.072 --> 02:03.306
social aspect of this club, yes?
We're looking for husbands who

02:03.308 --> 02:08.945
are equally impressive.
My husband... is... very

02:08.947 --> 02:11.381
impressive.
It seems like every day, I catch

02:11.383 --> 02:13.750
myself saying, "I can't believe
you just did that."

02:13.752 --> 02:15.952
Is he well-read?
Well-kept?

02:15.954 --> 02:17.954
Well-spoken?
Well...

02:17.956 --> 02:19.923
What's his name?
Kevin.

02:19.925 --> 02:25.495
Hmm.
Kevin Arian Foster Fitzgerald

02:25.497 --> 02:27.998
Peterson MacArthur, the third.
Hmm.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.433
Hmm.
But ever since his prep

02:30.435 --> 02:32.802
school days, we all just call
him Kip.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.238
Kip.
Mm-hmm.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.607
Kip. I'd love to meet Kip.
Me, too. Thank you.

02:37.609 --> 02:40.143
The other day, I was at the
bank, and, um, my teller was

02:40.145 --> 02:43.313
this old Southern shrimp boat
captain, so I gave him a 20, and

02:43.315 --> 02:45.315
he was like,:
"Oh, a $20 bill.

02:45.317 --> 02:47.684
Oh, now how do you want that?
You want two tens?"

02:47.686 --> 02:50.120
And I was like, "Hey, just give
me whatever you want."

02:50.122 --> 02:52.522
He's like, "No, no, I got to
keep 'em separated.

02:52.524 --> 02:54.925
I keep 'em all separated."
Okay, that's good.

02:54.927 --> 02:57.994
What is that?
Uh, that's... is Crawdad Man.

02:57.996 --> 03:00.931
Remember, class,
just because you don't have

03:00.933 --> 03:03.333
talent doesn't mean you can't
make it in this industry.

03:03.335 --> 03:05.669
I tell myself that every day,
yeah.

03:05.671 --> 03:08.104
It takes hard work,
perseverance.

03:08.106 --> 03:10.507
You want to be the person who
lights their farts on fire at a

03:10.509 --> 03:12.509
party?
No.

03:12.511 --> 03:14.511
Or do you want to be the
person who lights their farts on

03:14.513 --> 03:17.314
fire on a stage?
Whoa, whoa. I can do that?

03:17.316 --> 03:19.783
It's an option for you.
Okay, like a farting mime?

03:19.785 --> 03:21.718
Like, I'll be, like...

03:21.720 --> 03:27.524
No? Okay.
That's something I can work on.

03:27.526 --> 03:29.893
I can work on that.
You need to do your thing.

03:29.895 --> 03:32.162
Okay.
You need to find your truth.

03:32.164 --> 03:34.631
What is your thing?
I don't know. Tell me.

03:34.633 --> 03:36.733
You are an untalented,
uncharismatic, nondescript,

03:36.735 --> 03:38.969
balding white male?
And that's very difficult to

03:38.971 --> 03:41.171
pull off.
That's your thing, so you got

03:41.173 --> 03:43.206
to work with it.
Oh, I need a... I need a

03:43.208 --> 03:45.408
better thing.
I need a thing like-like her

03:45.410 --> 03:47.611
thing, you know?
Well, what's my thing?

03:47.613 --> 03:49.579
You know what your thing is.
No, actually, I don't know

03:49.581 --> 03:51.781
what my thing is.
What's my thing?

03:51.783 --> 03:53.583
You're doing it right now,
right?

03:53.585 --> 03:55.585
What is it? What is it?
What's my thing?

03:55.587 --> 03:57.621
Guys, tell her.
Whatever this thing is that

03:57.623 --> 03:59.689
you say I got, why you can't
tell me what it is?

03:59.691 --> 04:01.825
'Cause I'm not saying it's a
bad thing, not saying it's a

04:01.827 --> 04:03.927
good thing, I like your thing,
but you got a thing.

04:03.929 --> 04:06.029
Okay, that's...
You know what your thing is?

04:06.031 --> 04:07.430
You're an idiot.
How about that?

04:07.432 --> 04:09.432
Okay. By the way, I'm giving
you a compliment, okay?

04:09.434 --> 04:11.534
You know what? Shut up.
What all comics need to do

04:11.536 --> 04:14.804
is you need to say the things
people are afraid to say.

04:14.806 --> 04:19.309
You got to find the specifics.
Gonna bees, uh, specific!

04:19.310 --> 04:21.711
Is that Hitler?
Okay, I got it.

04:21.713 --> 04:23.913
Bitch, let me tell you
something.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.915
Hey, was that supposed to be
me?

04:25.917 --> 04:27.717
Aha. You're admitting you
have a thing.

04:27.719 --> 04:29.319
Please don't make me come up
there.

04:29.321 --> 04:31.087
Okay, Ben, you're next.
Uh, tip your waitress.

04:31.089 --> 04:32.922
Can you stop talking?
Okay. Just...

04:32.924 --> 04:34.624
No, don't tap.
No talking, no...

04:34.626 --> 04:39.729
Okay. Keep 'em separated.
Hmm. "Welcome to the Total

04:39.731 --> 04:44.668
Gym XL."
Height: six-three.

04:44.670 --> 04:50.640
Weight: One... eighty...
163.

04:50.642 --> 04:53.977
"How do you feel?"
Good.

04:53.979 --> 04:57.347
Good overall, but surely, there
are elements that can be

04:57.349 --> 05:00.617
improved.
"I don't appreciate how Jenny is

05:00.619 --> 05:02.986
constantly emasculating me in
front of the guys.

05:02.988 --> 05:05.355
It's embarrassing.
And I'm not exactly where I

05:05.357 --> 05:07.957
thought I'd be in my career.
I figured by this time, I would

05:07.959 --> 05:11.861
be at least Judge MacArthur or
Senator MacArthur.

05:11.863 --> 05:14.798
Certainly not District Attorney
MacArthur."

05:14.800 --> 05:18.635
Assistant District Attorney.
Hey, babe, what you doing?

05:18.637 --> 05:21.004
Hey. What's up?
Look at this, huh?

05:21.006 --> 05:23.440
Yeah.
Got it all ready to go.

05:23.442 --> 05:25.809
You still gonna love me when I'm
jacked?

05:25.811 --> 05:28.111
Does jacked mean you can fit
back into your tux?

05:28.113 --> 05:30.113
Probably not the pants.
Big news.

05:30.115 --> 05:32.882
The LLC approved me.
Oh!

05:32.884 --> 05:35.318
The Lucrative Ladies Club.
I'm in. I'm a lady.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.320
Congratulations.
That's awesome.

05:37.322 --> 05:39.489
I know. I'm so excited.
What kind of club is it?

05:39.491 --> 05:42.525
It's just a really great
group of women, and we talk

05:42.527 --> 05:44.861
about just investments.
Investments?

05:44.863 --> 05:47.063
Yeah.
All right, well, don't worry

05:47.065 --> 05:49.499
about it, okay?
I've got us taken care of.

05:49.501 --> 05:51.868
You do?
Yeah. I've been investing for

05:51.870 --> 05:54.070
years now.
Stocks, CDs, bonds?

05:54.072 --> 05:57.006
No, I've-I've got funds.
Mutual funds?

05:57.008 --> 05:59.409
Not exactly.
Just, more like, you know,

05:59.411 --> 06:02.812
different funds stashed...
throughout the house.

06:02.814 --> 06:05.982
You know, like, I have a pizza
fund and a kid fund and a little

06:05.984 --> 06:08.551
fun fund.
What's a fun fund?

06:08.553 --> 06:10.920
For when, like, I go to the
batting cages.

06:10.922 --> 06:13.156
You go to the batting cages?
I used to, but they make you

06:13.158 --> 06:15.225
wear a helmet, and they don't
have one that fits my head.

06:15.227 --> 06:17.427
Right. It sounds like you
have a really good handle on our

06:17.429 --> 06:19.829
finances.
Yeah, I do.

06:19.831 --> 06:21.831
If you're cool with it, I
might still play around with the

06:21.833 --> 06:24.033
ladies, just for social reasons.
You can do what you want, but

06:24.035 --> 06:26.436
I got us.
Been investing.

06:26.438 --> 06:28.405
I'm all over the place,
diversified.

06:28.407 --> 06:30.440
You're diversified throughout
our house.

06:30.442 --> 06:32.208
I love you.
All right, know that I have

06:32.210 --> 06:34.277
taken care of you.
Remember that.

06:34.279 --> 06:36.913
"I feel like she's beginning to

06:36.915 --> 06:39.349
doubt my financial acumen.
Maybe I should start a

06:39.351 --> 06:41.751
therapist's fund."
No, no, no.

06:41.753 --> 06:44.120
That would just take away from
my pizza fund.

06:44.122 --> 06:47.690
Ooh, pizza would be really good
right now.

06:49.848 --> 06:51.849
So I said to the patient,
"You have Alzheimer's."

06:52.009 --> 06:54.009
And he said to me, "What's the
bad news?"

06:54.011 --> 06:56.011
He died later that month.

06:56.013 --> 06:58.892
Hi, Dr. Ewing, hi.
Oh, Dr. Nowzick, hello.

06:59.012 --> 07:00.644
Hey, how you guys doing
tonight?

07:00.646 --> 07:02.646
It's actually 11:30 a.m.
You ever notice that

07:02.648 --> 07:05.016
hospitals are kind of like the
set of <i>Star Wars?</i>

07:05.018 --> 07:08.252
<i>I mean, what's this guy, uh, a</i>
<i>old school R2-D2?</i>

07:08.254 --> 07:11.155
<i>Like...</i>
<i>Just a medical cart.</i>

07:11.157 --> 07:12.823
<i>Where's that Princess Leia</i>
<i>hologram?</i>

07:12.825 --> 07:14.825
<i>Princess Leia, hello?</i>
<i>Princess Leia?</i>

07:14.827 --> 07:16.527
<i>I wouldn't go... No, that's</i>
<i>not Princess Leia.</i>

07:16.529 --> 07:18.529
<i>That's highly toxic used</i>
<i>needles.</i>

07:18.531 --> 07:20.164
<i>You probably contracted</i>
<i>something.</i>

07:20.166 --> 07:22.166
<i>Oh, well, uh, then help me,</i>
<i>Obi-Wan.</i>

07:22.168 --> 07:24.201
<i>I haven't seen all the Star</i>
<i>Wars</i> movies, but I don't

07:24.203 --> 07:26.203
believe that Obi-Wan can help
you with Hepatitis C.

07:26.205 --> 07:28.205
Thank you.

07:28.207 --> 07:30.307
You know what, if you want
the show to continue, just

07:30.309 --> 07:32.309
follow me right into this room.
Is there a medical emergency

07:32.311 --> 07:34.311
of some kind?
Oh, it's actually a joke

07:34.313 --> 07:36.347
emergency.
We have other rounds to...

07:36.349 --> 07:38.549
Uh, it is... it is actually a
medical emergency, so come,

07:38.551 --> 07:42.286
please, yes?
Oh, my goodness.

07:42.288 --> 07:46.123
What do we have here?
Looks like someone in a coma.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.125
Yes, he appears stable though.

07:48.127 --> 07:50.294
"Oh, hello.
My name's Joe."

07:50.296 --> 07:52.463
I'm beginning to suspect this
is not a medical emergency.

07:52.465 --> 07:54.732
"No, we're just being a
little cheeky, right?

07:54.734 --> 07:57.068
Behave."
This man will be moved to

07:57.070 --> 07:59.737
hospice later today.
Please let him die with dignity

07:59.739 --> 08:02.173
or at least as part of a more
coherent act.

08:02.175 --> 08:06.010
♪ Oh, oh, oh
Barely alive, barely alive ♪

08:06.012 --> 08:08.345
This is the saddest day this
ward has ever seen, and this is

08:08.347 --> 08:11.348
the terminal ward.
Maybe he's, uh, a Southern

08:11.350 --> 08:13.384
- shrimp boat captain.
- "Oh, you got

08:13.386 --> 08:15.419
to keep 'em separated.
You got to keep 'em separated or

08:15.421 --> 08:17.488
they're gonna eat themselves..."
What? What's going on here?

08:17.490 --> 08:20.057
Who are you?
"Hey! Nice sweater!

08:20.059 --> 08:23.094
Bill Cosby called.
He wants his closet back."

08:23.096 --> 08:25.996
We are his family.
Oh.

08:25.998 --> 08:30.501
You must be so proud.
He's in a coma.

08:30.503 --> 08:35.106
So proud and so sad.
So I got to pick a stage name.

08:35.107 --> 08:38.741
I'm thinking either Diamond Doc
Nowzick, huh?

08:38.744 --> 08:42.580
Or I wear all my scrubs and I
call myself Dr. Laughs.

08:42.582 --> 08:45.516
What about Lamey Foxx?
I have a lot of good stuff.

08:45.518 --> 08:48.185
Paula Shitstone.
Okay, what's up with delis,

08:48.187 --> 08:50.354
right? You go into...
Oh, no.

08:50.356 --> 08:52.389
What?
Wait, no, no, no, no, no.

08:52.391 --> 08:54.391
You guys are not supposed
to be here.

08:54.393 --> 08:56.527
Why?
I told you, today is my

08:56.529 --> 08:59.530
Lucrative Ladies Club meeting.
I am trying to maintain the

08:59.532 --> 09:02.433
impression of being a classy,
sophisticated lady about town.

09:02.435 --> 09:05.369
That is your problem right
there.

09:05.371 --> 09:08.038
I have spent all morning
clearing out all of the

09:08.040 --> 09:10.708
classless shit in this house,
and that includes all of you

09:10.710 --> 09:12.710
guys, okay?
So this frittata rodeo has got

09:12.712 --> 09:14.745
to hit the road.
I don't think so.

09:14.747 --> 09:16.747
I drove all the way out to the
suburbs; I'm staying.

09:16.749 --> 09:18.916
Yeah, I need an audience to
workshop my bits.

09:18.918 --> 09:21.418
Fine, you guys can
stay in here.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.821
Do not go in there.
Do not make a sound.

09:23.823 --> 09:26.223
I will let you know when you can
come out.

09:26.225 --> 09:28.459
So we can have our bro time,
we just got to do it Anne Frank

09:28.461 --> 09:30.594
style?

09:30.596 --> 09:33.564
Coming.
My God.

09:33.566 --> 09:36.267
Okay.
Good-bye, trashy magazines.

09:36.269 --> 09:39.603
Maude.
How are you?

09:39.605 --> 09:41.839
It's so good to see you.
Good to see you.

09:41.841 --> 09:44.608
Hello, hi.
Please come in.

09:44.610 --> 09:48.179
Oh, <i>Corbusier.</i>
<i>Did you see the retrospective?</i>

09:48.181 --> 09:50.648
<i>Oh, who didn't?</i>
<i>God, wonderful.</i>

09:50.650 --> 09:52.917
<i>Where's Kip?</i>
<i>Kip?</i>

09:52.919 --> 09:55.786
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Kip is doing social work</i>

09:55.788 --> 09:59.023
<i>today.</i>
<i>Mm-hmm. He works with inner-city</i>

09:59.025 --> 10:01.859
<i>kids, teaching them to cook with</i>
<i>gredients from the urban</i>

10:01.861 --> 10:04.328
<i>garden that they planted</i>
<i>together.</i>

10:04.330 --> 10:06.297
<i>Wow, yeah, I've read</i>
<i>about that.</i>

10:06.299 --> 10:08.532
<i>Yeah, I read about that, too.</i>
<i>Yeah, and then from there, he</i>

10:08.534 --> 10:10.601
<i>goes straight to his advanced</i>
<i>Italian class.</i>

10:10.603 --> 10:13.270
<i>He is obsessed with the idea of</i>
<i>writing me poetry in Italian.</i>

10:13.272 --> 10:15.606
<i>Aw.</i>
<i>Aw.</i>

10:15.608 --> 10:18.609
<i>Yeah, he's something else.</i>

10:18.611 --> 10:21.946
<i>That Kip.</i>
<i>Um, you know, I have a plumber</i>

10:21.948 --> 10:24.982
<i>in the garage, I know.</i>
<i>He's plumbing.</i>

10:24.984 --> 10:27.117
<i>Just make yourselves</i>
<i>comfortable.</i>

10:27.119 --> 10:29.787
<i>There's wine and cheese.</i>
<i>All right, great, thank you.</i>

10:29.789 --> 10:32.356
<i>Oh, look at, the kid's got a</i>
<i>block on the outside.</i>

10:32.358 --> 10:34.358
<i>Yeah!</i>

10:34.360 --> 10:36.860
<i>That was a good block.</i>
<i>Hey, shh!</i>

10:36.862 --> 10:39.563
<i>What part of "keep it down"</i>
<i>don't you understand, Kip?</i>

10:39.565 --> 10:41.999
<i>Who's Kip? Hey, hey,</i>
<i>give me that back.</i>

10:42.001 --> 10:45.002
<i>Kevin, just...</i>
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no! Hey!</i>

10:45.004 --> 10:47.905
<i>That's our lifeline!</i>
<i>Bitches be trippin'.</i>

10:47.907 --> 10:49.840
<i>Andre, no.</i>

10:49.842 --> 10:56.046
<i>I can hear something.</i>
<i>I'm basically the father</i>

10:56.048 --> 10:58.382
<i>figure around here.</i>
<i>That is taken care of.</i>

10:58.384 --> 11:00.551
<i>They can't take care of</i>
<i>themselves.</i>

11:00.553 --> 11:02.553
<i>People ask me for advice.</i>
<i>I give it to them.</i>

11:02.555 --> 11:04.755
<i>I don't charge them for it.</i>
<i>Ladies, Taco, hi.</i>

11:04.757 --> 11:06.824
<i>Hey, Jenny.</i>
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

11:06.826 --> 11:09.193
<i>Taco Corp is looking for</i>
<i>funding, so I decided to pop in.</i>

11:09.195 --> 11:12.196
<i>I am so sorry.</i>
<i>And I am so grateful.</i>

11:12.198 --> 11:14.665
<i>Thank you for bringing in a</i>
<i>guest speaker.</i>

11:14.667 --> 11:17.234
<i>All right, Mr. Taco,</i>
<i>let's talk Taco Corp.</i>

11:17.236 --> 11:19.703
<i>What kind of businesses do you</i>
<i>dabble in?</i>

11:19.705 --> 11:21.705
<i>Well, Taco Corp is</i>
<i>multi-faceted.</i>

11:21.707 --> 11:23.707
<i>We have dealings in</i>
<i>telecommunications.</i>

<i>Excellent, excellent.</i>
<i>Ringtones.</i>

11:25.745 --> 11:27.678
<i>Textiles.</i>
<i>Nice.</i>

11:27.680 --> 11:29.380
<i>Pee bibs.</i>
<i>We develop weapons for the</i>

11:29.382 --> 11:31.048
<i>military.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

11:31.050 --> 11:32.850
<i>The brown note?</i>
<i>We're working on cloud</i>

11:32.852 --> 11:34.718
<i>technology.</i>
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

11:34.720 --> 11:36.720
<i>Our Taco is always in the</i>
<i>cloud.</i>

11:36.722 --> 11:38.956
<i>I'm in the cloud right now.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

11:38.958 --> 11:40.958
<i>Yeah, and the whole operation</i>
<i>began out of a storage</i>

11:40.960 --> 11:42.860
<i>container.</i>
<i>Whoa.</i>

11:42.862 --> 11:45.095
<i>Whoa.</i>
<i>That he still lives in.</i>

11:45.097 --> 11:47.298
<i>And what kind of tax</i>
<i>shelter do you recommend?</i>

11:47.300 --> 11:49.366
<i>I don't recommend shelters at</i>
<i>all.</i>

11:49.368 --> 11:51.602
<i>Stop using them three years ago.</i>
<i>Very risky.</i>

11:51.604 --> 11:53.737
<i>You can get murdered in one of</i>
<i>those things.</i>

11:53.739 --> 11:55.973
<i>Wow, you're operating on a</i>
<i>whole different level than us.</i>

11:55.975 --> 11:58.642
<i>That's the cloud.</i>
<i>Oh, cheers, cheers.</i>

11:58.644 --> 12:00.911
<i>To Taco Corp.</i>
<i>Taco Corp.</i>

12:00.913 --> 12:05.082
<i>To Taco Corp.</i>
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

<i>We have bread, we have meat,</i>
<i>we have cheese.</i>

<i>I love you, good-bye.</i>
<i>Whoa, hey.</i>

12:22.134 --> 12:24.568
<i>You know, sometimes she treats</i>
<i>me like an animal.</i>

12:24.570 --> 12:29.440
<i>I'm not an animal.</i>

12:29.442 --> 12:32.810
<i>What is that?</i>
<i>This is Kevin's diary, where</i>

12:32.812 --> 12:35.612
<i>he writes all of his specific</i>
<i>thoughts about his reps.</i>

12:35.614 --> 12:37.815

<i>So, thank you.</i>

12:40.019 --> 12:42.086
<i>Well, one thing I can do here</i>
<i>is make an announcement.</i>

<i>Pete, I will also be playing</i>
<i>seven players this weekend.</i>

12:44.323 --> 12:46.857
<i>So you are gonna lose fair and</i>
<i>square, my friend.</i>

12:46.859 --> 12:49.259
<i>Why would you do that?</i>
<i>Well, 'cause he's never gonna</i>

12:49.261 --> 12:51.762
<i>let me live it down.</i>
<i>If I beat him and he's only got</i>

12:51.764 --> 12:53.864
<i>seven players, he's gonna make a</i>
<i>whole thing out of it.</i>

12:53.866 --> 12:55.999
<i>That's stupid, Ruxin.</i>
<i>You realize that just because</i>

12:56.001 --> 12:58.202
<i>you are the Sacko, you don't</i>
<i>have to actually be the worst.</i>

12:58.204 --> 13:00.037
<i>Yeah, and he doesn't even</i>
<i>have a choice.</i>

13:00.039 --> 13:01.872
<i>You have a choice.</i>
<i>So I'll just play</i>

13:01.874 --> 13:03.540

<i>Are you gonna welch now?</i>

13:03.542 --> 13:05.209
<i>What?</i>
<i>You gonna chicken out?</i>

13:05.211 --> 13:06.877
<i>Oh, yeah, now you can't welch.</i>

13:06.879 --> 13:08.545
<i>Welcher! You're a</i>

<i>You said you were gonna</i>
<i>do it; now you're not gonna</i>

13:10.349 --> 13:12.216
<i>do it. Flip-flop, flip-flop...</i>
<i>You know what, guys, if he</i>

13:12.218 --> 13:14.284
<i>wants to start an extra player,</i>
<i>let him start Wes Welcher.</i>

13:14.286 --> 13:16.186
<i>It's fine.</i>
<i>You know what...</i>

13:16.188 --> 13:18.021
<i>Oh, oh, very funny.</i>
<i>You know what, the puppeteer</i>

13:18.023 --> 13:20.791
<i>moving all the strings here.</i>
<i>This is all collusion.</i>

13:20.793 --> 13:22.960
<i>You guys have been planning this</i>
<i>from the beginning, and you know</i>

13:22.962 --> 13:24.995

<i>I don't need this. I'm out.</i>

13:24.997 --> 13:27.297
<i>You brought this on.</i>
<i>I'm leaving, I'm leaving.</i>

13:27.299 --> 13:30.000
<i>Bye, Wes Welcher.</i>
<i>Hey, Kevin, your wife,</i>

<i>I'm going out the garage door!</i>
<i>Hey, do you have</i>

13:34.473 --> 13:36.573
<i>a funny bone?</i>
<i>Find out at my comedy show.</i>

13:36.575 --> 13:38.976
<i>Come on, hey, all right.</i>
<i>What are you doing on Monday?</i>

13:38.978 --> 13:41.545
<i>There you go, all right.</i>
<i>Comedy consultations.</i>

13:41.547 --> 13:44.148
<i>The doctor is in.</i>
<i>Yes, thank you.</i>

13:44.150 --> 13:46.550
<i>What? Hey, give me those.</i>
<i>My associates and I would</i>

13:46.552 --> 13:50.087
<i>like to build a paper boat!</i>
<i>Just stop making a scene and</i>

13:50.089 --> 13:52.189
<i>go please.</i>
<i>By the way, you smell of</i>

13:52.191 --> 13:54.324
<i>feces.</i>
<i>It's not me; it's you.</i>

13:54.326 --> 13:56.927
<i>Kettle black.</i>
<i>Good day.</i>

13:56.929 --> 13:59.062
<i>Oh... hey.</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

13:59.064 --> 14:01.432
<i>Good day!</i>

14:01.434 --> 14:07.504
<i>Uh, actually, sir...</i>
<i>I can't believe Taco got the</i>

14:07.506 --> 14:10.107
<i>LLC to go to Andre's stupid</i>
<i>stand-up show.</i>

14:10.109 --> 14:12.009
<i>Taco told them it was worth</i>
<i>seeing.</i>

14:12.011 --> 14:13.877
<i>They listen to everything Taco</i>
<i>says.</i>

14:13.879 --> 14:15.612
<i>Who listens to anything Taco</i>
<i>says?</i>

14:15.614 --> 14:17.247
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>The other day he called me up</i>

14:17.249 --> 14:19.283
<i>to tell me, "I like biscuits."</i>
<i>I like biscuits.</i>

14:19.285 --> 14:21.251
<i>I like biscuits, too.</i>
<i>But then he sent me a text later</i>

14:21.253 --> 14:23.387
<i>on: "I still like biscuits."</i>
<i>I don't know what to tell</i>

14:23.389 --> 14:25.189
<i>you, but the ladies love him.</i>
<i>So we're going.</i>

14:25.191 --> 14:26.857
<i>Awesome.</i>
<i>So, uh, when do you want to</i>

14:26.859 --> 14:28.525
<i>leave?</i>
<i>Oh. Um...</i>

14:28.527 --> 14:31.061
<i>I mean, I have errands to run.</i>
<i>I can run errands.</i>

14:31.063 --> 14:33.397
<i>Tampons.</i>
<i>I'm great with tampons now.</i>

14:33.399 --> 14:36.467
<i>I look directly at the cashier</i>
<i>and I say, "Tampons, please,"</i>

14:36.469 --> 14:38.302
<i>with a big smile.</i>
<i>It's a power trip for me.</i>

14:38.304 --> 14:40.103
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>I was just thinking we'd take</i>

14:40.105 --> 14:41.972
<i>separate cars.</i>
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

14:41.974 --> 14:43.774
<i>You don't want to be seen with</i>
<i>me?</i>

14:43.776 --> 14:45.776
<i>I want to impress the</i>
<i>Lucrative Ladies!</i>

14:45.778 --> 14:47.444
<i>Go ahead, go ahead.</i>
<i>Go out, hang out with your</i>

14:47.446 --> 14:48.679
<i>friends.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

14:48.681 --> 14:50.380
<i>I feel like I look fine,</i>
<i>though.</i>

14:50.382 --> 14:52.282
<i>I really do.</i>
<i>Is this sweatshirt on backwards?</i>

14:52.284 --> 14:54.696
<i>'Cause the loops go down both</i>
<i>sides, and I-I...</i>

14:54.816 --> 14:56.417
<i>Oh, bye, Kevin.</i>
<i>...I put it on both ways.</i>

14:56.518 --> 14:57.421
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

14:59.413 --> 15:00.173
Where's my journal?

15:03.766 --> 15:07.212
Where's my journal?
What'd she do with my journal?

15:08.195 --> 15:11.452
Where'd she put it?
Oh!

15:15.950 --> 15:19.676
Did someone put it in here?!
Jenny left, I can't find my journal.

15:22.730 --> 15:25.625
It's got to be here somewhere.

15:25.627 --> 15:27.460
Oh...
Oh, God!

15:27.462 --> 15:32.231
God, c-come on.
Oh, I got to go.

15:32.351 --> 15:36.636
Oh, I got to go! Oh...
Great. I'm a mess.

15:36.638 --> 15:40.072
And I have no time to change.
Okay.

15:40.074 --> 15:42.008
Got to do what you got to do.

15:42.010 --> 15:46.412
Ah!
Good evening, madam.

15:46.414 --> 15:49.348
We are here to see Dr. Laughs.
Nope, I'm sorry.

15:49.350 --> 15:51.651
Not tonight, guys.
But we have a legally binding

15:51.653 --> 15:53.886
contract.
And we have a dress code.

15:53.888 --> 15:57.690
And I have a bathrobe.
We demand service!

15:57.692 --> 15:59.559
We demand...
Hi, hi!

15:59.561 --> 16:02.161
These are my guests, and, uh,
they can put it all on the card.

16:02.163 --> 16:04.063
Now I can perform 'cause I have
the right number of people,

16:04.065 --> 16:05.331
right?
Okay.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.766
Okay, we have a two-drink
minimum.

16:06.768 --> 16:10.670
Uh, don't worry.
It's all going on the card.

16:10.672 --> 16:12.572
Oh...
God.

16:12.574 --> 16:14.674
Smells like a diaper party.
Yeah, except nobody's wearing a

16:14.676 --> 16:16.375
diaper.
What can I get you to drink?

16:16.377 --> 16:18.411
Ah.
Do you have any wood alcohol?

16:18.413 --> 16:20.546
No.
I guess we'll have six red

16:20.548 --> 16:22.882
wine and Cokes.
Hello!

16:22.884 --> 16:24.584
Hi.
Hello, girlfriend.

16:24.586 --> 16:26.719
Hi, girlfriend.
I was just asking Mr. Taco

16:26.721 --> 16:28.888
here what his next move in the
market's gonna be.

16:28.890 --> 16:30.590
Oh.
Market, well...

16:30.592 --> 16:33.860
My gut's telling me that I
should be buying some fruit.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.628
The produce sector.
Very intriguing.

16:35.630 --> 16:37.797
You're so brilliant.
I know.

16:37.799 --> 16:39.732
Are you guys sleeping together?

16:39.734 --> 16:42.735
Define "sleeping."
Hey, everybody, thanks for

16:42.737 --> 16:47.707
coming to the Bringer Showcase!
I know you're all here because

16:47.709 --> 16:50.776
you had to be here, uh...
that's why I'm here.

16:50.778 --> 16:54.480
So let's give it up for Diamond
Doc Nowzick!

16:54.482 --> 16:57.450
Dr. Laughs.

16:57.452 --> 16:59.719
Dr. Laughs.
Let's give it up for Dr.

16:59.721 --> 17:03.789
Laughs.
You know, I'm kind of feeling

17:03.791 --> 17:05.458
the other one.
I feel we should go back.

17:05.460 --> 17:08.961
Andre, come up here.
Yeah, let's give it up.

17:08.963 --> 17:10.730
Yeah.
All right.

17:10.732 --> 17:12.397
Yeah.
Hey, everybody!

17:12.400 --> 17:14.333
By the time you're done tonight,
you're gonna need an emergency

17:14.335 --> 17:19.771
chuckle-ostomy.
You ever notice, uh, when you're

17:19.773 --> 17:21.773
going to the bathroom out in a
public place, there's always

17:21.776 --> 17:24.577
like, a, uh, long line for the
ladies', very short line for the

17:24.579 --> 17:26.846
men's room...
Here comes Crawdad Man.

17:26.848 --> 17:28.981
But in the middle there's a
Southern boat captain who's

17:28.983 --> 17:32.318
like, "Oh!
You gotta keep 'em separated!"

17:32.320 --> 17:34.587
'Cause, uh, you know, he's,
like, Crawdad Man.

17:34.589 --> 17:36.989
Uh, excuse me.
Yes, uh, some crowd work.

17:36.991 --> 17:40.960
When does the comedy start?

17:40.962 --> 17:42.962
Maybe we'll do some
observational stuff.

17:42.964 --> 17:44.630
Uh...
How about we observe you

17:44.632 --> 17:47.700
leaving the stage?

17:47.702 --> 17:49.535
This is amazing.
Andre is losing a battle of wits

17:49.537 --> 17:51.370
with a hobo.
Yeah.

17:51.372 --> 17:53.639
I thought you took the
Hippocratic Oath to <i>not</i> make us

17:53.641 --> 17:55.775
sick.

17:55.777 --> 17:59.312
Well, and I thought you took
an oath of the audience member,

17:59.314 --> 18:01.314
which is to be quiet during the
show.

18:01.316 --> 18:03.049
I will.
Just let me know when the show

18:03.051 --> 18:05.284
starts.

18:05.286 --> 18:07.853
That's what your m said
before I had sex with her.

18:07.855 --> 18:11.958
Well, now you have gonorrhea.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.793
Really, everything's coming
up Ruxin.

18:13.795 --> 18:16.696
I get to see Andre flail
publicly, I'm gonna eke out a

18:16.698 --> 18:19.165
two-point win versus you,
<i>mano y mano.</i>

18:19.167 --> 18:21.000
<i>You know, there's still the</i>
<i>Falcons and the Jets playing</i>

18:21.002 --> 18:22.735
<i>right now.</i>
<i>Yeah, but you don't have</i>

18:22.737 --> 18:24.670
<i>anybody playing that game.</i>
<i>Unless I decided last</i>

18:24.672 --> 18:27.073
<i>minute to pick up, like, a</i>
<i>Harry Douglas and a Kellen</i>

18:27.075 --> 18:29.008
<i>Winslow off the free agent pile.</i>
<i>You know, just to get a couple</i>

18:29.010 --> 18:30.676
<i>of points.</i>
<i>No, that's not fair.</i>

18:30.678 --> 18:32.345
<i>That's collusion!</i>
<i>How is that collusion?</i>

18:32.347 --> 18:34.513
<i>You're colluding with me</i>
<i>against myself!</i>

18:34.515 --> 18:36.315
<i>Whoa, hey, simmer down there,</i>
<i>fella.</i>

18:36.317 --> 18:38.517
<i>I don't come to your job and</i>
<i>knock the mop out of your hands.</i>

18:38.519 --> 18:42.021
<i>I'm not a janitor, Andre.</i>
<i>But you did just get broomed.</i>

18:42.023 --> 18:45.992
<i>Hey, you guys like insult humor.</i>

18:45.994 --> 18:47.660
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

18:47.662 --> 18:49.495
<i>Uh, I'm here for Dr. Laughs or</i>
<i>Dr. Giggles...</i>

18:49.497 --> 18:51.497
<i>I don't know what he's calling</i>
<i>himself-- the unfunny doctor?</i>

18:51.499 --> 18:53.332
<i>Right this way.</i>
<i>Who do we got?</i>

18:53.334 --> 18:54.834
<i>Your friends are right over</i>
<i>here.</i>

18:54.836 --> 18:56.736
<i>No, I-I don't... I don't</i>
<i>know these people.</i>

18:56.738 --> 18:58.704
<i>Ugh, more homeless.</i>
<i>They'll let anybody in.</i>

18:58.706 --> 19:00.406
<i>It's gross.</i>
<i>Take a seat, we have a show</i>

19:00.408 --> 19:02.008
<i>going on.</i>
<i>I don't have anyone...</i>

19:02.010 --> 19:03.542
<i>Nice outfit, sir.</i>
<i>What do you call that?</i>

19:03.544 --> 19:05.411
<i>Homeless chic?</i>
<i>Where'd you get that?</i>

19:05.413 --> 19:07.371
<i>From sleeping in your car?</i>
<i>Like he has a car!</i>

19:07.373 --> 19:09.206
<i>Shut up... oh. Oh!</i>

19:09.208 --> 19:11.050
<i>Hey... hello.</i>
<i>God, no.</i>

19:11.052 --> 19:12.284
<i>No!</i>
<i>Ew!</i>

19:12.286 --> 19:13.853
<i>Ew!</i>
<i>Oh, my God, do you know this</i>

19:13.855 --> 19:15.087
<i>guy?</i>
<i>No.</i>

19:15.089 --> 19:16.547
<i>Yeah, she does.</i>
<i>That's her husband.</i>

19:16.549 --> 19:17.782
<i>That's Kip?</i>
<i>Kip?</i>

19:17.784 --> 19:19.216
<i>Kip?</i>
<i>Hey, Kip.</i>

19:19.218 --> 19:21.118
<i>What the hell.</i>
<i>This is my husband Kevin.</i>

19:21.120 --> 19:24.955
<i>He keeps money in shoeboxes, is</i>
<i>a total shit pig, and he is so</i>

19:24.957 --> 19:28.025
<i>much more fun than you guys.</i>
<i>Good night.</i>

19:28.027 --> 19:30.761
<i>Whoa, Jenny!</i>
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

19:30.763 --> 19:33.297
<i>I-I was really late, and I</i>
<i>can't find my diary.</i>

19:33.299 --> 19:35.266
<i>Maybe it's because I found it.</i>

19:35.268 --> 19:37.635
<i>You guys want to hear a</i>
<i>passage from his diary?</i>

19:37.637 --> 19:39.437
<i>No, no, Andre, those are my</i>
<i>private reps!</i>

19:39.439 --> 19:42.306
<i>"Sometimes I wish I married</i>
<i>someone smarter, because then at</i>

19:42.308 --> 19:45.284
<i>least my kids would have a</i>
<i>chance to get a real job."</i>

19:45.286 --> 19:47.411
<i>What?</i>

19:47.413 --> 19:50.081
<i>I don't... that's crazy.</i>
<i>"I swear, half of my wife's</i>

19:50.083 --> 19:53.284
<i>vocabulary is just curse words."</i>
<i>Oh, eat a dick, Andre.</i>

19:53.286 --> 19:55.086
<i>Whoa!</i>

19:55.088 --> 19:57.888
<i>Her mouth is so dirty, you guys</i>
<i>wouldn't even sleep in it.</i>

19:57.890 --> 19:59.957
<i>What kind of woman are you?</i>
<i>I'm awesome.</i>

19:59.959 --> 20:02.326
<i>The kind of woman who takes</i>
<i>her husband from behind.</i>

20:02.328 --> 20:04.095
<i>Kind of like I just did to</i>
<i>your team.</i>

20:04.097 --> 20:05.763
<i>Oh, you watch your mouth.</i>
<i>Whoa, these guys are</i>

20:05.765 --> 20:07.898
<i>fighting, these guys are</i>
<i>fighting.</i>

20:07.900 --> 20:10.601
<i>You know what you gotta do?</i>
<i>You gotta keep 'em separated!</i>

20:10.603 --> 20:12.403
<i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

20:12.405 --> 20:14.071
<i>Taco!</i>
<i>Oh, hey, Luther.</i>

20:14.073 --> 20:16.841
<i>You owe me $16 and a bag of</i>
<i>old dinner rolls.</i>

20:16.843 --> 20:18.609
<i>Why would you write something</i>
<i>like that?</i>

20:18.611 --> 20:20.478
<i>That was... those weren't my</i>
<i>thoughts, that was just what I</i>

20:20.480 --> 20:22.146
<i>was thinking!</i>
<i>Oh, come on, dummy.</i>

20:22.148 --> 20:24.181
<i>For your information, I'm not</i>
<i>the one who screwed you here.</i>

20:24.183 --> 20:25.983
<i>Yes, you are!</i>
<i>I just convinced you to take</i>

20:25.985 --> 20:27.918
<i>your own dick and screw your own</i>
<i>ass.</i>

20:27.920 --> 20:29.587
<i>Well, let me tell you</i>
<i>something, Pete!</i>

20:29.589 --> 20:31.622
<i>It feels just about the same!</i>
<i>You know the rules, Luther.</i>

20:31.624 --> 20:33.858
<i>If you don't keep your dinner</i>
<i>rolls in your cart, they're</i>

20:33.860 --> 20:36.994
<i>anyone's rolls.</i>

20:36.996 --> 20:38.485
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>That's my time!</i>

20:38.605 --> 20:42.014
<i>You guys have been great!</i>
<i>Keep 'em separated.</i>
