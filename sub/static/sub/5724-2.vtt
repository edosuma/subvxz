me. I should probably head out.

16:57.757 --> 16:59.325
It's good seeing you again, Ali.

16:59.325 --> 17:01.261
You, too.

17:01.261 --> 17:02.328
Afternoon, ma'am.

17:02.328 --> 17:05.464
Come back anytime.

17:05.464 --> 17:07.433
Who was he?

17:07.433 --> 17:09.269
Just an old friend of mine.

17:09.269 --> 17:10.537
Is he single?

17:10.537 --> 17:13.172
Oh, yeah... well, I think he is... I...

17:13.172 --> 17:16.009
I have a niece who would
love him. She's just like me.

17:16.009 --> 17:18.411
She's got a terrible weakness
for a guy with rough hands.

17:21.481 --> 17:23.983
[approaching footsteps]

17:23.983 --> 17:27.983
Almost forgot the most
important piece of the puzzle.

17:28.655 --> 17:32.258
I'm sure you didn't mean
to leave that behind.

17:38.431 --> 17:41.634
He's a bit intense, isn't he?

17:41.634 --> 17:45.634
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine, I...

17:46.239 --> 17:50.310
Say, what are you doing for
the rest of the afternoon?

17:50.310 --> 17:53.680
Uh, I-I don't have any plans.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.349
Why don't you come up to
the house for a cup of tea?

17:56.349 --> 17:58.318
I feel truly terrible that we
haven't had a chance to connect.

17:58.318 --> 17:59.485
You know, I'm usually very good

17:59.485 --> 18:01.087
about making our guests feel at home.

18:01.087 --> 18:03.156
It's just that it's been insane at work

18:03.156 --> 18:05.625
and with Robert's injury, and
I haven't had a minute to myself

18:05.625 --> 18:09.625
and I'm afraid my manners
have gone right out the window.

18:10.029 --> 18:12.765
You must give me a chance
to make it up to you.

18:12.765 --> 18:15.368
How about 3:00?

18:15.368 --> 18:19.205
- Okay.
- Oh, wonderful.

18:19.205 --> 18:21.407
I'll see you then.

18:59.712 --> 19:02.448
[Yvonne] That's the tour.

19:02.448 --> 19:04.183
Well, you have such a beautiful home.

19:04.183 --> 19:05.652
Thank you.

19:05.652 --> 19:09.055
A house, it's... it's
like a marriage, actually.

19:09.055 --> 19:11.024
You gotta be in it for the long haul

19:11.024 --> 19:13.326
if you ever want to see it come together.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.994
What kind of tea can I get you?

19:14.994 --> 19:17.196
I'll... I'll take anything, really.

19:17.196 --> 19:20.066
So polite. You clearly
had excellent parents.

19:20.066 --> 19:23.202
All righty, I'm making Moroccan mint.

19:25.738 --> 19:29.208
Oh! Darling. Look who I found.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.110
Hey. I see you got back
here all by yourself.

19:31.110 --> 19:33.012
How was the dump?

19:33.012 --> 19:35.214
The dump is literally Robert's
favorite place in town.

19:35.214 --> 19:36.649
You never know what
you'll find at the dump.

19:36.649 --> 19:38.651
Someone dropped off a
Herman Miller chair today.

19:38.651 --> 19:40.086
- No!
- Yeah.

19:40.086 --> 19:41.554
That's astonishing.

19:41.554 --> 19:43.589
I saved that chair and
I'm gonna refurbish it

19:43.589 --> 19:45.458
and when it's done, you're not
gonna be allowed to sit in it.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.627
You rest.

19:47.627 --> 19:50.430
I made you lunch.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.031
What happened?

19:52.031 --> 19:54.400
Ugh, I had a knee surgery a few weeks ago.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.335
- It's fucking annoying.
- I'll tell you what's annoying.

19:56.335 --> 19:58.337
The fact that you won't do
your physical therapy exercises

19:58.337 --> 20:00.273
because you think you're smarter than Hugo.

20:00.273 --> 20:01.441
I am smarter than Hugo.

20:01.441 --> 20:03.209
Who's Hugo?

20:03.209 --> 20:05.511
He's this ridiculously
expensive physical therapist

20:05.511 --> 20:07.113
that Yvonne imported from France.

20:07.113 --> 20:08.648
He's from New Jersey.

20:08.648 --> 20:11.551
Who has choreographed an
entire exercise routine for me

20:11.551 --> 20:13.519
because what he really
wants to do is dance.

20:13.519 --> 20:15.388
Hugo made the mistake of telling Robert

20:15.388 --> 20:17.190
that he had been in a ballet
corp when he was younger,

20:17.190 --> 20:19.258
and now Robert can't take
anything he says seriously.

20:19.258 --> 20:21.527
The best thing you can do
after knee surgery is just walk.

20:21.527 --> 20:23.396
How do you know that?

20:23.396 --> 20:25.264
Everybody knows that. The
whole internet knows it.

20:25.264 --> 20:27.133
Actually, the best thing you could do

20:27.133 --> 20:29.402
is work out with an elastic band.

20:29.402 --> 20:31.270
A lot of people make the
mistake of focusing on

20:31.270 --> 20:33.372
strength building, but in the beginning

20:33.372 --> 20:35.441
range of motion is much more important.

20:35.441 --> 20:37.477
Oh, you sound like you know
what you're talking about.

20:37.477 --> 20:39.078
Sit, dear.

20:39.078 --> 20:41.981
Oh, well, I was a nurse for a while.

20:41.981 --> 20:44.250
You were a nurse? Fascinating.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.519
Well, what are you doing now?

20:46.519 --> 20:48.654
Uh...

20:48.654 --> 20:51.424
I don't actually know.

20:51.424 --> 20:55.424
I know that sounds ridiculous
because I'm 32, but I, uh...

20:56.496 --> 21:00.666
I guess I'm still trying to figure it out.

21:00.666 --> 21:02.602
Welcome to the club.

21:02.602 --> 21:04.070
- [phone rings]
- Oh, shit.

21:04.070 --> 21:06.272
I have a conference call. I forgot.

21:09.075 --> 21:11.277
You know, Yvonne has been looking

21:11.277 --> 21:13.012
for a personal assistant.

21:13.012 --> 21:14.413
Oh?

21:14.413 --> 21:16.282
Yeah, someone to help her
and me around the house.

21:16.282 --> 21:18.151
She really shouldn't be here at all.

21:18.151 --> 21:19.685
She usually spends Monday through Thursdays

21:19.685 --> 21:21.154
in the city for work.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.990
What does she do?

21:23.990 --> 21:27.160
She's the head of Radford House.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.394
Uh...

21:28.394 --> 21:31.063
It's a major publishing house.

21:31.063 --> 21:32.265
Oh.

21:32.265 --> 21:33.499
[chuckles]

21:33.499 --> 21:37.503
I don't know anything about publishing.

21:37.503 --> 21:39.572
My God, I like you.

21:39.572 --> 21:42.175
Anyway, our last
assistant wasn't competent.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.676
We had to fire her,

21:43.676 --> 21:46.245
but it's been a disaster here without her.

21:46.245 --> 21:48.347
Yvonne's afraid to leave me alone.

21:48.347 --> 21:50.316
[Yvonne] Well, I don't
understand why this wasn't done

21:50.316 --> 21:52.351
when I asked, Shane.

21:52.351 --> 21:54.120
I specifically laid out the
numbers that needed to be run

21:54.120 --> 21:55.588
and you said you'd have it on her desk...

21:55.588 --> 21:57.723
She's starting to resent
me for keeping her here.

21:57.723 --> 22:00.059
If I don't figure out how to
get her back to the city soon,

22:00.059 --> 22:02.061
it's going to get ugly.

22:02.061 --> 22:04.030
Uh... I'd be happy to help.

22:04.030 --> 22:05.598
It's not a glamorous job,

22:05.598 --> 22:09.702
and you seem horribly
overqualified for this position.

22:09.702 --> 22:12.471
I just thought, since you're
here and you seem kind of bored

22:12.471 --> 22:14.607
- and we get along so well...
- I'll take it.

22:14.607 --> 22:16.409
I told you, I should have
fired Shane after the holidays,

22:16.409 --> 22:18.544
but you made me feel bad
because his wife had just had

22:18.544 --> 22:20.246
those hideous twins.

22:20.246 --> 22:21.747
Yvonne.

22:21.747 --> 22:24.650
Meet your new assistant.

22:24.650 --> 22:27.153
Oh, God bless you.

22:31.090 --> 22:34.227
[vehicle approaches]

22:48.341 --> 22:49.408
Hi.

22:50.676 --> 22:53.546
How was your day?

22:53.546 --> 22:56.048
Fine.

23:09.595 --> 23:11.664
What are you making?

23:11.664 --> 23:14.066
Dover sole.

23:14.066 --> 23:15.434
Does that taste fishy?

23:19.038 --> 23:22.141
Well, it's a fish.

23:22.141 --> 23:24.477
Whatever.

23:24.477 --> 23:27.280
What's wrong?

23:27.280 --> 23:29.749
A shit day.

23:29.749 --> 23:33.019
What happened?

23:33.019 --> 23:34.687
Where do I start? The
mediator was a burn-out.

23:34.687 --> 23:38.524
Whitney won't speak to me,
my mother-in-law's homicidal.

23:38.524 --> 23:40.326
Harry hates my book.

23:40.326 --> 23:44.397
Not gonna publish it, so in a
month I will be broke, jobless,

23:44.397 --> 23:48.397
homeless, and I will have
lost custody of my kids.

23:52.271 --> 23:54.407
I'm sorry.

23:56.375 --> 23:59.178
Is there anything I can do to help?

24:03.416 --> 24:06.152
What's going on with your house?

24:06.152 --> 24:08.321
What do you mean?

24:08.321 --> 24:11.424
Are you selling it or what?

24:11.424 --> 24:13.225
[small laugh]

24:13.225 --> 24:15.461
I-I don't think so, I...

24:26.973 --> 24:28.674
You hungry? Dinner's almost ready.

24:28.674 --> 24:30.509
Where's my manuscript?

24:30.509 --> 24:34.380
I, uh, I put it in a
drawer for safekeeping.

24:43.589 --> 24:45.725
- Have you... have you read it?
- No, of course not.

24:45.725 --> 24:47.560
I don't want you to
read it before it's done.

24:47.560 --> 24:50.062
No, I... I was worried
it would get blown away.

24:50.062 --> 24:53.232
It was... breezy today.

25:03.676 --> 25:07.713
And guess what I did today.

25:07.713 --> 25:09.015
What did you do?

25:09.015 --> 25:11.484
I got a job.

25:11.484 --> 25:12.485
[laughs] Where?

25:12.485 --> 25:14.353
With Robert and Yvonne.

25:14.353 --> 25:16.088
They've asked me to be
their personal assistant.

25:16.088 --> 25:19.492
What?

25:19.492 --> 25:22.395
What, is something wrong with that?

25:22.395 --> 25:24.163
Uh...

25:24.163 --> 25:27.233
Yes, Alison. That's fucking weird.

25:27.233 --> 25:28.968
Why?

25:28.968 --> 25:31.070
Because we're their guests,
and they invited me here

25:31.070 --> 25:33.305
to finish my novel.

25:33.305 --> 25:35.474
What, so I can't work for them?

25:35.474 --> 25:38.711
- Are you working for free?
- No.

25:38.711 --> 25:41.147
Oh. That is...

25:41.147 --> 25:44.316
That is completely inappropriate.

25:44.316 --> 25:46.685
They're already doing me a
favor and now they gotta pay you.

25:46.685 --> 25:48.220
Noah, they offered me a job.

25:48.220 --> 25:50.256
You should have said no.

25:50.256 --> 25:53.492
Well, I didn't want to.

25:53.492 --> 25:55.594
You know, I can't deal with this right now.

26:17.116 --> 26:18.684
[sighs]

26:19.752 --> 26:21.687
[door opens]

26:29.261 --> 26:33.632
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:33.632 --> 26:34.767
I'm an asshole.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.535
Yeah. Ha.

26:40.172 --> 26:43.042
Forgive me.

26:47.279 --> 26:50.015
It's okay.

26:53.652 --> 26:55.654
This is hard, isn't it? I
mean, it's not just me, right?

26:55.654 --> 26:58.491
No, it's not just you.

27:02.228 --> 27:04.463
I just want you to be happy, that's all.

27:04.463 --> 27:07.166
I just want you to be happy.

27:07.166 --> 27:08.501
Oh.

27:11.137 --> 27:15.341
Oh.

27:15.341 --> 27:17.710
I am happy.

27:21.113 --> 27:23.182
You sure?

27:35.194 --> 27:37.730
Oh, oh.

27:43.569 --> 27:45.504
I love you.

27:50.609 --> 27:54.246
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

28:18.737 --> 28:20.739
[door shuts]

28:23.075 --> 28:25.311
It works.

28:25.311 --> 28:28.247
Yvonne called a plumber?

28:28.247 --> 28:29.381
That's right.

28:29.381 --> 28:31.183
Wow, look at this.

28:31.183 --> 28:32.985
[small giggle]

28:46.398 --> 28:49.735
What are we drinking to?

28:49.735 --> 28:51.704
To us.

28:56.475 --> 28:57.977
To us.

29:05.451 --> 29:07.219
[elevator door dings]

29:25.271 --> 29:27.606
Hey.

29:27.606 --> 29:29.375
I need to talk to you.

29:29.375 --> 29:31.210
I'm sorry, and you are?

29:31.210 --> 29:32.678
I'm his wife.

29:32.678 --> 29:36.678
Ah. The famous Ms. Alison Bailey.

29:37.516 --> 29:40.386
It's a pleasure to finally
meet you. Jon Gottlief.

29:40.386 --> 29:43.255
Yeah, I know who you are.

29:43.255 --> 29:45.190
What are you doing here?

29:45.190 --> 29:47.693
Providing counsel to your husband.

29:47.693 --> 29:49.194
What?

29:49.194 --> 29:51.030
I'm his lawyer.

29:51.030 --> 29:53.232
- No.
- Yes.

29:55.134 --> 29:57.269
What... what, did Noah call you?

29:57.269 --> 30:01.407
Helen did.

30:01.407 --> 30:03.575
She shouldn't be getting involved.

30:03.575 --> 30:05.044
I'm his wife now.

30:05.044 --> 30:07.012
Yes, we are all quite
painfully aware of that.

30:07.012 --> 30:09.481
So any decisions concerning my
husband's legal representation

30:09.481 --> 30:11.183
need to go through me.

30:11.183 --> 30:12.718
Do they? Really?

30:12.718 --> 30:15.354
Because your husband has
already accepted my services.

30:15.354 --> 30:16.588
I'll tell you what.

30:16.588 --> 30:18.357
From here on in, we will do our very best

30:18.357 --> 30:21.427
to keep you in the loop.

30:21.427 --> 30:24.330
What, is she paying you?

30:24.330 --> 30:26.198
Yes, of course.

30:26.198 --> 30:30.602
- That's not acceptable.
- If you will excuse me.

30:33.272 --> 30:34.506
Ms. Bailey,

30:34.506 --> 30:36.475
I am sure that this will work out

30:36.475 --> 30:40.079
exactly how it... should.

30:53.793 --> 30:57.700

31:20.052 --> 31:23.522
[woman over PA in background]

31:29.395 --> 31:31.663
[engine turns]

31:32.998 --> 31:36.435
64 Elizabeth Lane, Montauk.

31:49.348 --> 31:51.583
So how's business?

31:53.752 --> 31:55.687
You speak English?

31:58.157 --> 31:59.658
Yeah, of course I speak English.

31:59.658 --> 32:03.295
I asked how business is this summer.

32:10.035 --> 32:14.239
Uh... no. No, it's my first summer driving.

32:14.239 --> 32:15.574
I knew it.

32:15.574 --> 32:19.574

32:20.012 --> 32:22.281
It's a nice area we got out here, isn't it?

32:22.281 --> 32:24.416

32:35.661 --> 32:37.496
When we first bought property out here,

32:37.496 --> 32:40.199
it was a farm and fishing community.

32:40.199 --> 32:42.534
Our friends thought we were crazy.

32:42.534 --> 32:45.704
So far away, nothing to do.

32:45.704 --> 32:49.741
But I loved it. I loved the peace.

32:49.741 --> 32:52.177
I loved the way the corn
grew so high in summer

32:52.177 --> 32:55.714
and then just disappeared one day.

32:55.714 --> 32:58.417
I loved the colors in the fall.

32:58.417 --> 33:00.552
The fallow fields in the winter.

33:00.552 --> 33:03.322
The way the ocean changes
like a moody woman.

33:03.322 --> 33:07.322

cold and gray the next.

33:08.360 --> 33:10.729
It's just not the same anymore.

33:10.729 --> 33:12.764
And it'll never go back, you know?

33:12.764 --> 33:15.367
That's the terrible thing about living.

33:15.367 --> 33:19.204
You never get to go back no
matter how badly you miss it.

I know it's impossible.

33:40.158 --> 33:42.528
Does that make me a fool?

33:42.528 --> 33:44.363
I don't know, sir.

33:44.363 --> 33:46.098
You'd have to tell me
more about the situation.

33:46.098 --> 33:47.499
[chuckles]

33:47.499 --> 33:51.737
It's a long story.

33:51.737 --> 33:54.506
My son-in-law left
my daughter recently.

33:54.506 --> 33:56.575
He's a pathetic son of a bitch,
and as far as I'm concerned,

33:56.575 --> 33:58.677
good riddance.

33:58.677 --> 34:01.380
But it got me thinking.

34:01.380 --> 34:04.316
If that poor, talentless schmuck
thinks he deserves to be happy,

34:04.316 --> 34:06.251
why don't I?

34:06.251 --> 34:10.222
So I went online and I tracked
down this girl I used to know.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.056
I called her up.

34:12.056 --> 34:15.661
And then I went to see
her, and now we're in love.

34:15.661 --> 34:19.531
I just took her to Barcelona for a weekend.

34:35.647 --> 34:39.150
I've been married for over 40 years.

34:45.123 --> 34:48.327
40 wasted years.

34:53.165 --> 34:56.400
So what happened
to your son-in-law?

34:56.400 --> 34:59.137
Sorry?

34:59.137 --> 35:00.505
Your
son-in-law.

35:00.505 --> 35:02.307
Or, I guess, your
ex-son-in-law now.

35:02.307 --> 35:04.109
Whatever happened to him?

35:04.109 --> 35:08.146
Oh. I feel bad for the guy, actually.

35:08.146 --> 35:12.146
He's 45, has no savings.
All the money was ours.

35:13.018 --> 35:17.522
I heard he lost his job.

35:17.522 --> 35:21.522

I don't know. I can't remember now.

52:37.428 --> 52:40.564
Remember that long run
we took on New Year's Day,

52:40.564 --> 52:44.402
before I got pregnant?

52:44.402 --> 52:48.402
Went out to the lighthouse and
back and then we made pancakes

52:49.440 --> 52:53.244
and we sat by the fire
and read... that afternoon?

52:53.244 --> 52:56.213
Yeah, I remember.

52:56.213 --> 52:58.616
I've been thinking about that day recently.

53:05.089 --> 53:07.692
That was a really good day, wasn't it?

53:11.228 --> 53:13.631
Yes, that was a good day.

53:37.655 --> 53:39.423
I needed these.

53:39.423 --> 53:43.194
Thank you for bringing them.

53:43.194 --> 53:45.663
Can I ask you a question
before I head back?

53:53.170 --> 53:56.240
Are you ever coming home?

53:59.643 --> 54:01.512
I don't think so.
