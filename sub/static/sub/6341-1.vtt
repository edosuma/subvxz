00:18.785 --> 00:19.318
ADMISSION

00:19.319 --> 00:22.287
<i>An admissions officer
must have a strong constitution...</i>

00:22.288 --> 00:23.956
<i>to be on the receiving end of...</i>

00:23.957 --> 00:26.725
<i>..-an entire nation's application panic.</i>

00:26.726 --> 00:31.726
<i>To endure the frustration and anger
of all the so-called millennial parents,</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:32.798
<i>who just realized...</i>

00:32.799 --> 00:35.200
- Come on, hurry up!
- God, mom, relax.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.836
<i>There isn't room
for every perfectly nurtured,</i>

00:37.837 --> 00:39.874
<i>organically fed,
well-tutored offspring.</i>

00:39.973 --> 00:41.673
OK, I'm your tour guide.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.375
There's no point
in trying to impress me.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.912
I have absolutely no power
over your fate here.

00:46.913 --> 00:48.914
The people with the power
are right in there.

00:48.915 --> 00:51.122
The Admissions officers.

00:51.317 --> 00:54.520
And no,
that sign is not an omen.

00:54.521 --> 00:56.288
Except for some of you.

00:56.289 --> 00:57.956
Almost all of you, actually.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.425
We had twenty six thousand,

00:59.426 --> 01:02.895
two hundred and forty one
applications last year.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.397
One thousand, three hundred
and eight of those applicants...

01:05.397 --> 01:07.469
are attending school here.

01:14.507 --> 01:17.709
James, tours leave at 9:15.
It is 9:25.

01:17.710 --> 01:21.346
Sorry, I thought I'd wait.
We had a late arrival.

01:21.347 --> 01:24.453
I'm sorry, our GPS lied.

01:25.452 --> 01:28.120
No worries, Mrs...

01:28.121 --> 01:29.464
...Lafont.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.832
Welcome to Princeton.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.961
So what's the secret
to getting in?

01:35.962 --> 01:37.498
The secret.

01:41.401 --> 01:42.868
Just be yourself.

01:42.869 --> 01:47.409
If this is the right place for you,
then this is where you'll end up.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.742
- James?
- Ok, let's go see Princeton.

01:50.743 --> 01:51.944
We're going to play
a fun game.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.246
It's called spot
the Nobel Prize winner.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.647
<i>What's the secret
to getting in?</i>

01:55.648 --> 01:57.249
<i>There has to be one, right?</i>

01:57.250 --> 01:58.317
<i>Well, there is.</i>

01:58.318 --> 02:00.719
<i>But I can't tell you.
Not yet.</i>

02:00.720 --> 02:03.322
<i>What I can tell you
is everyone thinks we're sadists.</i>

02:03.323 --> 02:06.191
<i>That we like saying no.
This is not true.</i>

02:06.192 --> 02:08.293
- No.
- Portia.

02:08.294 --> 02:08.926
<i>No no no.</i>

02:08.928 --> 02:11.530
You're second reader
on my territory this season.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.799
Yes, I know.
As are you on mine.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.246
That's the way it works.

02:18.271 --> 02:21.980
I'll just wail
until you catch up with me.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.678
<i>We are in this job
for one reason.</i>

02:26.679 --> 02:28.113
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Is this Portia Nathan?</i>

02:28.114 --> 02:28.580
<i>To say.</i>

02:28.581 --> 02:29.214
Yes.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.583
Wow, I didn't think I'd gel you.
It's John Pressman...

02:31.584 --> 02:34.386
...from the New Quest School
in Keene, New Hampshire.

02:34.387 --> 02:34.987
OK.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.023
Yeah, I sent you a few e-mails
and left a couple messages.

02:38.024 --> 02:39.091
Listen, thank you for calling.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.326
Can you please e-mail me your information
and I will call you back?

02:41.327 --> 02:42.327
<i>Hey, not so rough.</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:44.096
How'd you like
to have your udder yanked like that?

02:44.097 --> 02:46.465
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, I was just talking to a student.

02:46.466 --> 02:49.601
People, everyone, please.

02:49.602 --> 02:51.904
I have a couple
of announcements.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.572
There is an announcement.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.207
Portia,
we're a new developmental school...

02:55.208 --> 02:57.743
and we have our first
graduating class this year.

02:57.744 --> 03:00.312
I know you're going to be making
your school visits in the next few weeks.

03:00.313 --> 03:02.014
<i>I'd like for you
to visit our campus.</i>

03:02.015 --> 03:04.816
<i>Our kids would gain a lot from it
and I think you would too.</i>

03:04.817 --> 03:06.818
Right, I will look into it.
Gotta go.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.887
You know,
I went to Dartmouth, same time as you.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.156
Bye.
Thank you for calling.

03:11.157 --> 03:15.127
So we're breaking records
in application numbers, naturally...

03:15.128 --> 03:18.931
...because we've been
number one for so long.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.776
Number one until today.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.775
Princeton has just fallen
to number two.

03:27.307 --> 03:31.577
What this means
is that we all have to work harder than ever...

03:31.578 --> 03:33.845
...because I want to go out on top.

03:33.846 --> 03:36.815
Yes,
you see the rumors are true.

03:36.816 --> 03:38.817
I've decided to retire.

03:38.818 --> 03:43.021
And pass the baton
to a worthy successor.

03:43.022 --> 03:45.724
I'm spending an extra four days
in the Andover-Hotchkiss triangle.

03:45.725 --> 03:49.494
And I've added five full days to the San Francisco
Bay Area and Northern California.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.763
And I've added a number
of new schools.

03:51.764 --> 03:55.100
In fact, I was just talking
to the co-founder of Quest.-.

03:55.101 --> 03:58.303
...a developmental high school
with their first year of college applicants.

03:58.304 --> 04:00.105
Clarence,
we're going to be back on lop.

04:00.106 --> 04:01.540
We're going to make that happen.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.953
By working together.
Right, Portia?

04:04.777 --> 04:06.188
Absolutely.

04:06.613 --> 04:09.348
As a mother myself,
I know the importance of teamwork.

04:09.349 --> 04:13.118
And I am not a mother,
but I know the importance of it loo.

04:13.119 --> 04:14.792
Can't go it alone.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.190
Good.

04:18.190 --> 04:21.392
Because you two
are my superstars...

04:21.394 --> 04:24.997
...and nothing would make me happier
than if one of you...

04:24.998 --> 04:29.003
.-.were to have this office next year-.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.184
OK.

04:40.813 --> 04:43.726
Class of 2016.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.454
Pediatric surgery best combines
my love of children...

04:49.455 --> 04:53.492
...of science, and my desire
to give back to my community.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.927
Yes, but you didn't challenge
yourself academically.

04:55.928 --> 04:59.671
B's in Physics
and you didn't take AP Chem.

05:02.368 --> 05:03.235
UNLIKELY

05:03.236 --> 05:04.403
<i>Princeton's awesome.</i>

05:04.404 --> 05:09.478
Since 1841, every male in my family
has attended the place.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.244
Student Body President.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.112
And gymnastics
national champion.

05:14.113 --> 05:16.848
Educated family.
Privileged upbringing.

05:16.849 --> 05:18.350
Unfair advantage?

05:18.351 --> 05:21.520
2400 on the SAT. 4.5 GPA.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.189
And my poetry,
written in my mother's psych ward...

05:24.190 --> 05:27.492
...will be published by Knopf.
And my father is Cuban.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.200
And in a wheelchair.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.666
- Can I gel some advice?
- No.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.868
Applicalus interruptus.
You know the rule.

05:36.869 --> 05:39.509
Never start a folder
if you can't finish it.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.041
I have to start over anyway.
OK.

05:43.042 --> 05:46.244
This kid from Alaska,
Aput Kunayak.

05:46.245 --> 05:49.214
High grades,
but low scores.

05:49.215 --> 05:52.451
President of ten clubs,
but that might be because of his ADD.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.953
We want to accept people
who will succeed here.

05:54.954 --> 05:59.524
You know, I once fought for a bipolar Inuit girl
and she lasted nineteen days.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.793
- Do you think he might fail?
- Maybe.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.535
I like him.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.040
It's so hard.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.468
You can't take it
so personally.

06:09.469 --> 06:12.416
You have to toughen up
or you won't last here either.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.552
Now outsies.
I'm swamped.

06:15.475 --> 06:16.920
<i>Portia?</i>

06:17.410 --> 06:19.185
I hope it's you.

06:19.445 --> 06:20.753
Thank you.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.883
Back to work.

06:35.194 --> 06:36.172
<i>Portia!</i>

06:36.729 --> 06:37.329
Hello?

06:37.330 --> 06:39.831
Portia?
Portia? Portia...

06:39.832 --> 06:42.033
I'm so sorry,
I've got an emergency.

06:42.034 --> 06:44.469
Can you just watch the kids
while I run to the vet?

06:44.470 --> 06:46.438
Because Richard's
at his Faulkner seminar.

06:46.439 --> 06:47.439
Me?

06:47.440 --> 06:49.107
Well, Mark should have been home
twenty minutes ago,

06:49.108 --> 06:51.343
and it's our poetry night, and...

06:51.344 --> 06:54.848
...really, I'm the last person
you want watching your kids.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.824
Quiet!

07:02.522 --> 07:05.257
- Did someone die?
- Rachael's dog is sick.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.601
She begged me.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.801
Good times.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.874
- I've got essays to grade.
- No.

07:19.472 --> 07:22.174
It's OK.
Mommy's here.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.241
What did you do to them?

07:23.242 --> 07:25.744
Rachael,
you know Portia's not good with kids.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.245
It's not her fault.

07:27.246 --> 07:30.615
Kids just don't take
to some people.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.823
I don't know
what you were thinking.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.953
Sorry, he's right.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.856
They're like pit bulls.
They can smell fear.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.324
Good night.

07:39.325 --> 07:40.633
Take them all.

07:49.035 --> 07:52.170
You know, if I gel Clarence's job,
this will be my last travel season.

07:52.171 --> 07:53.371
Lovely and wonderful.

07:53.372 --> 07:56.408
I've got everything planned out.
I'll be back in time for the department lunch.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.943
And I've ordered everything,
you just need to pick up the...

07:57.944 --> 08:02.581
...chicken and I will stop and get
the famous bean salad on my way home.

08:02.582 --> 08:05.250
The famous bean salad.

08:05.251 --> 08:08.153
Is that horrible Woolf woman
going to be there?

08:08.154 --> 08:12.257
Helen is the preeminent
Virginia Woolf scholar.

08:12.258 --> 08:13.792
It was quite a coup
to get her from Cambridge.

08:13.793 --> 08:16.895
But I think
she has other plans.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.705
Lovely and wonderful.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.977
I like this life.

08:26.372 --> 08:29.819
- I do, I do.
- Good. So do I.

08:31.611 --> 08:34.922
It's so wonderfully...

08:35.081 --> 08:36.081
...simple.

08:36.082 --> 08:39.495
Well, we're simple folk.

08:43.722 --> 08:44.723
Woof!

08:44.724 --> 08:45.724
Excuse me?

08:45.725 --> 08:48.827
You just patted me
on the head like a dog.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.273
Did I?

08:50.963 --> 08:52.738
Good doggie.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.852
Hi.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.520
Thank you so much for coming.

09:15.521 --> 09:17.422
My pleasure.
We love Deerfield students.

09:17.423 --> 09:19.190
I'm so pleased.
Good.

09:19.191 --> 09:21.831
- Can I help you bring in your things?
- Yes, please.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.002
<i>Princeton.</i>

09:31.003 --> 09:35.281
<i>In the nation's service
and in the service of all nations.</i>

09:37.009 --> 09:42.584
So, you all want to know
the secret formula for getting in, right?

09:42.915 --> 09:45.984
Take out your pens.
Write this down.

09:45.985 --> 09:48.363
There is no secret formula.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.656
<i>Left on Pony Run Drive.</i>

09:51.657 --> 09:53.959
But I will tell you
what not to do.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.127
No champagne,
no baked goods,

09:56.128 --> 09:59.064
and when you phone,
it is noted in your file.

09:59.065 --> 10:02.634
So put the reins
on those eager parents of yours.

10:02.635 --> 10:04.035
We're looking for passion.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.304
Whatever it's for,
doesn't matter.

10:06.305 --> 10:07.138
Passion.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.074
<i>Right on Shady Lane.</i>

10:09.075 --> 10:13.678
Does that mean every Princeton
undergraduate is a genius or a prodigy?

10:13.679 --> 10:14.980
Absolutely not.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.816
Although we certainly
wouldn't hold it against you.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.592
Almost enough for everybody.

10:24.957 --> 10:29.463
Recalcu Eating.
Recalculating. Recalculating-.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.801
Make a U turn
as soon as possible.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.008
The New Quest School

10:39.171 --> 10:40.013
No Service

10:56.088 --> 10:57.355
<i>HEY-</i>

10:57.356 --> 10:58.630
Hi.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.559
Portia Nathan,
Princeton Admissions office.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.194
I know. I'm John.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.664
Yes, and you said
you went to Dartmouth?

11:05.665 --> 11:09.100
Yeah, and my dad,
and his dad, and his dad.

11:09.101 --> 11:10.201
A legacy-

11:10.202 --> 11:12.773
A legacy of what,
I'm not really sure.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.874
So you're chopping
some wood here?

11:15.875 --> 11:19.277
I'm showing them how to build
a sustainable irrigation system.

11:19.278 --> 11:20.945
This is my third world
development class.

11:20.946 --> 11:22.881
Well, nice axe.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.520
Great axe.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.164
- So let's gel to it.
- Yeah.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.071
Hi there.

11:46.072 --> 11:50.680
You all want to know the secret formula
for getting in, right?

11:53.145 --> 11:55.648
Well, take out your pens.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.426
Take them out.

12:04.156 --> 12:05.464
Yes?

12:06.025 --> 12:08.359
I'll tell you what I'd like to know.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.929
Why should I apply
to an elitist institution...

12:10.930 --> 12:14.666
.-.with a history of anti-black, anti-gay,
and anti-female oppression?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.768
Well, actually,
I reject that stereotype-

12:16.769 --> 12:17.902
Speaking of rejection,

12:17.903 --> 12:20.939
don't you reject 99.9 percent
of your applicants?

12:20.940 --> 12:23.808
And don't you just want to drum up applications
to keep your number one position...

12:23.809 --> 12:25.076
on U.S. News
and World Report?

12:25.077 --> 12:27.645
Well actually,
I think it's number two this year, right?

12:27.646 --> 12:30.648
- Yes, but-
- No, I'm sure it's an aberration.

12:30.649 --> 12:33.017
Don't people just need
a college degree if you want lo pursue...

12:33.018 --> 12:35.787
the societally
approved definition of success?

12:35.788 --> 12:38.623
Yeah, wouldn't you be better
off sitting in your room reading books...

12:38.624 --> 12:40.158
instead of spending all that money?

12:40.159 --> 12:41.793
I'm sorry, _
are you a senior?

12:41.794 --> 12:43.261
No, I'm in sixth grade.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.997
Yeah, Portia,
this is my son, Nelson.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.032
I'm adopted.
I was born in Uganda.

12:48.033 --> 12:50.809
- Love you, buddy.
- OK, dad.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.939
I thought it would be educational
for him to sit in on this.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.975
How's it going so far?
Are you learning a lot?

12:56.976 --> 12:59.244
Kind of.
Half and half.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.913
- Well there you go.
- OK. Right.

13:01.914 --> 13:05.016
Well, Nelson, sure...

13:05.017 --> 13:08.486
sitting in a room and reading books
would be very cost effective, but-

13:08.487 --> 13:10.388
Princeton is a corporation.

13:10.389 --> 13:12.624
No different
than an oil company.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.260
We should be educating ourselves
to be citizens of the world...

13:15.261 --> 13:17.362
and not of some guarded
suburban enclave.

13:17.363 --> 13:21.869
What we want is to leave the planet
better than we found it.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.445
OK. Well.
Good luck with that.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.017
Wail, wait.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.778
I want to hear about Princeton, please.

13:33.779 --> 13:37.048
OK, fine.
But first, I have a question for all of you.

13:37.049 --> 13:40.251
Just how will you leave
the planet better?

13:40.252 --> 13:43.254
Will you eradicate disease?
You're going to need a medical degree.

13:43.255 --> 13:45.990
If you want to create new drug therapies,
that's a PhD.

13:45.991 --> 13:50.128
Do you want to defend the innocent
and secure justice for all?

13:50.129 --> 13:53.731
I regret to inform you
that you will have to go to law school.

13:53.732 --> 13:56.501
There are plenty
of college graduates out there...

13:56.502 --> 13:59.671
...ardently hoping to leave the world
better than they found it.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.940
We are looking
for those people!

14:01.941 --> 14:07.323
Students with blazing minds
and hearts who will change the goddamn world!

14:11.217 --> 14:13.885
All right, Portia.
Well done!

14:13.886 --> 14:17.026
I bet you guys
feel like bunch of assholes.

14:21.894 --> 14:22.660
Sorry,
I probably should have warned you.

14:22.661 --> 14:24.429
Sorry,
I probably should have warned you.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.131
We tend to encourage
that sort of spirited debate here.

14:27.132 --> 14:28.600
But you did well.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.945
You can hit a curveball.

14:32.037 --> 14:35.506
You know, I'd really like
to introduce you to somebody.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.342
This is Jeremiah Balakian.

14:37.343 --> 14:39.010
He's a very special student.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.079
My parents work in a mini-mart.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.480
They're not very educated.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.883
Do you think that matters?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.218
Of course not.
It's your application.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.654
Maybe I should apply then.
Princeton seems like a cool place.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.389
It's very cool.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.391
So you're saying
I should apply?

14:53.392 --> 14:55.126
You know,
I'm not really your typical student.

14:55.127 --> 14:59.473
My brain sort of goes
on a little Walkabout, you know?

14:59.765 --> 15:02.100
Yes, you should apply.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.903
And if you would like
to visit the campus...

15:04.904 --> 15:07.906
...we can match you up with an undergrad
and you can spend the night in his room.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.973
That sounds great.

15:08.974 --> 15:12.210
Then you could hang out
and gel to know each other.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.612
Well, I don't really hang out
with the applicants.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.247
- That's not how it works.
- Right.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.515
Because
there's over twenty thousand of them.

15:17.516 --> 15:18.650
Exactly.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.632
Still,
I think you should gel to know this one.

15:23.188 --> 15:24.923
So, Portia,
like the Merchant of Venice?

15:24.924 --> 15:25.490
Yes.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.926
My mother thought if she named me
that I would grow up to be wise.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.193
I'm lucky
she didn't name me Athena.

15:29.194 --> 15:30.962
Or Minerva.
Or Sophie.

15:30.963 --> 15:32.196
Except a lot of people
are named Sophie.

15:32.197 --> 15:33.498
They probably don't even know
what their name means.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.266
Or Metis.
That would be really strange.

15:35.267 --> 15:39.871
Or if your name was Aushenaya
or lﬂok or Saraswati.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.572
I think you got lucky.

15:41.573 --> 15:44.417
If you had to be called something
that stands for wisdom.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.381
Well, thanks for this.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.556
I have to go.
I have robotics class.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.390
- Interesting kid.
- He's a great kid.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.392
He's become
like part of my family.

16:01.393 --> 16:02.994
I met him at a garage sale.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.562
He was reading a law
encyclopedia.

16:04.563 --> 16:07.565
We went and had coffee
and talked for five hours.

16:07.566 --> 16:08.733
He's a prodigy.

16:08.734 --> 16:11.536
Well, be sure to include all of that
in your recommendation.

16:11.537 --> 16:13.016
Bye.

16:17.176 --> 16:20.111
So how long have you been
at Princeton?

16:20.112 --> 16:21.312
Since college.
Sixteen years.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.348
Wow, that's a long time
to stay in one place.

16:23.349 --> 16:24.148
Are you married?

16:24.149 --> 16:25.516
No I live with someone.

16:25.517 --> 16:26.784
- Chair of the English Department.
- Kids?

16:26.785 --> 16:27.752
Thousands.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.620
Can you get these cows
out of the way?

16:29.621 --> 16:31.155
I doubt it.
They're enormous.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.590
That one's pregnant.

16:32.591 --> 16:33.891
Where do you stay
while you're here?

16:33.892 --> 16:37.203
My morn lives
about ten miles away.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.745
Mom?

16:42.901 --> 16:44.209
It's me.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.537
Who?

16:46.538 --> 16:48.373
How many people
call you morn?

16:48.374 --> 16:51.609
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

16:51.610 --> 16:54.112
I left a message.
I was visiting a school nearby.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.880
<i>K never check
my messages.</i>

16:55.881 --> 16:57.548
That's a good policy.

16:57.549 --> 17:00.585
<i>Thought Yd spend the night
if it's a“ right with you.</i>

17:00.586 --> 17:03.888
I've got to gel up very early,
and then hit a few schools and race back...

17:03.889 --> 17:05.089
...for Mark's
department lunch.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.858
How can you stand
those English Department gatherings?

17:07.859 --> 17:09.127
What could be more dull?

17:09.127 --> 17:13.297
Sometimes you make sacrifices for the person
you've been living with for ten years.

17:13.298 --> 17:14.932
That's what a healthy relationship is.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.968
Thank god
I'm not in one of those.

17:16.969 --> 17:17.835
Yes.
Thank god.

17:17.836 --> 17:22.640
If I had to do what I was supposed to be doing
every minute of my life, like you do...

17:22.641 --> 17:24.746
...I'd kill myself.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.579
Did you just say if you were me
you would kill yourself?

17:28.580 --> 17:30.782
Portia, don't' exaggerate.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.883
I'm working on my bike.

17:31.884 --> 17:36.320
You know, they actually have stores
where you can buy bikes already made.

17:36.321 --> 17:38.956
And did you know that women
are the only exploited group in history...

17:38.957 --> 17:41.659
...to have been idealized
into powerlessness.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.528
<i>- Erica Jung.
- Erica long.</i>

17:43.529 --> 17:44.896
Hey pups!

17:44.897 --> 17:46.205
Hey!

17:46.665 --> 17:49.333
Hi Gloria! Hi Betty!
Hi!

17:49.334 --> 17:50.868
Whoa, you're so skinny.

17:50.869 --> 17:52.036
Come on,
let's gel you something to eat.

17:52.037 --> 17:52.970
No, no.

17:52.971 --> 17:55.139
They're not skinny,
they're lean.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.075
Dogs are too dependent
on humans.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.510
I'm not their slave.
They can gel their own damn food.

17:59.511 --> 18:02.346
- From where?
- Outside. Gophers, squirrels...

18:02.347 --> 18:05.483
- ..-neighbor's cat.
- An unattended baby?

18:05.484 --> 18:09.520
They're carnivores.
They're meant to be hunters.

18:09.521 --> 18:13.264
Here,
hand me that chain break.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.407
Mom, you look...

18:17.529 --> 18:18.974
bigger.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.399
These?
Fake.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.935
Fake?
You mean you had a boob job?

18:23.936 --> 18:26.337
No, I had a mastectomy.

18:26.338 --> 18:27.772
These are prosthetic.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.374
I was wondering, you know,
women who have really big breasts,

18:30.375 --> 18:32.243
I'd like to see what that's like...

18:32.244 --> 18:35.646
...and I'll tell you,
they get so in the way, it's unbelievable.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.082
I'm thinking
of trading them in for a mid-size.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.151
When?
When did you have a mastectomy?

18:40.152 --> 18:42.553
I don't know.
Five weeks ago or so.

18:42.554 --> 18:44.322
Who keeps track?

18:44.323 --> 18:46.424
They found a lump.
It was aggressive.

18:46.425 --> 18:47.158
Hadn't spread yet.

18:47.159 --> 18:50.328
I'm aggressive too, so I said "what the hell,
why push my luck?

18:50.329 --> 18:51.706
Take them both."

18:52.231 --> 18:53.831
Why didn't you tell me?

18:53.832 --> 18:56.108
I am telling you.

18:56.401 --> 18:57.568
Now.

18:57.569 --> 19:01.005
Well I would have driven you
to the hospital.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.073
Portia...

19:02.074 --> 19:04.308
I cabbed it.
I'm OK.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.245
You know,
I'm thinking you should...

19:07.246 --> 19:10.615
.-.start calling me Susannah.

19:10.616 --> 19:12.950
I think
this could help us avoid...

19:12.951 --> 19:19.095
...all this mother-daughter role playing crap
that you can't seem to shake.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.325
You're welcome to stay...

19:21.326 --> 19:24.773
but there's not much for supper
unless you want to go pick some kale.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.675
I'm remodeling
your old room.

19:30.335 --> 19:34.579
That's good.
I'm going to make a tea kettle.

19:35.874 --> 19:38.252
<i>Come on, do it!</i>

19:40.679 --> 19:42.659
<i>Oh baby.</i>

19:50.389 --> 19:52.924
- Portia Nathan.
- John Pressman.

19:52.925 --> 19:53.925
Hi.

19:53.926 --> 19:58.529
Look, I wanted to see if you wanted to maybe
get a drink or a bite to eat or something?

19:58.530 --> 20:01.399
Maybe talk about the application process,
since we're new to it?

20:01.400 --> 20:05.507
- I can swing by and pick you up.
- I guess I could eat.

20:07.105 --> 20:09.774
The parents all think
that their kids' acceptance...

20:09.775 --> 20:12.443
is the final referendum
on their parenting skills...

20:12.444 --> 20:14.312
...which, hello,
it's not about you.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.748
As far as I can tell,
parents exist just to drive their kids insane.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.417
Of course,
what the hell do I know, really?

20:19.418 --> 20:21.219
Why, were you raised
by wolves?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.054
Wolf.
Singular.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.122
- One wolf.
- One wolf.

20:25.123 --> 20:27.391
And you never wanted kids?

20:27.392 --> 20:29.627
I love that question.

20:29.628 --> 20:34.628
It seemed unfair to subject anyone
to the miserable experience I had.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.000
Why would you?

20:36.001 --> 20:38.603
There's no way in hell I would raise
Nelson the way I was raised.

20:38.604 --> 20:39.503
Why not?

20:39.504 --> 20:41.772
Because I was raised by sheep.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.475
So... Uganda.

20:44.476 --> 20:48.646
I was working there
and Nelson's morn was a friend.

20:48.647 --> 20:51.015
And she died in a car crash.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.751
Along with his uncle.
Nelson was two.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.920
So you adopted him.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.089
Seemed like the only thing to do.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.859
All my friends
thought for sure that I'd bail.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.528
That I was not ready
to be a father, but...

21:04.529 --> 21:06.998
- ...screw that.
- Right. Screw that.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.800
Nelson loves traveling.
He loves it.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.836
We've lived in Indonesia.

21:11.837 --> 21:15.539
We built a water
purification system in Myanmar.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.975
I'm sorry,
so you're just this single dad...

21:17.976 --> 21:21.045
...traveling the world with his kid,
doing good?

21:21.046 --> 21:24.081
Well, when you put it like that
it just sounds so appealing.

21:24.082 --> 21:26.584
But I have that on a t-shirt,
actually.

21:26.585 --> 21:29.320
'Single dad,
traveling the world with his kid, doing good"

21:29.321 --> 21:30.755
You can borrow it
some day if you like.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.457
I'm not sure
people would believe it on me.

21:33.458 --> 21:37.161
Anyway,
it's the best thing I ever did...

21:37.162 --> 21:38.863
...adopting a kid.

21:38.864 --> 21:40.537
It's getting late.

21:44.403 --> 21:45.736
Excuse me?

21:45.737 --> 21:49.840
Oh no, I can't do that, actually.
I can't accept gifts.

21:49.841 --> 21:51.442
Excuse me?

21:51.443 --> 21:54.219
Princeton wants to buy me
a chicken sandwich.

22:03.855 --> 22:06.096
Thank you so much.

22:08.293 --> 22:12.029
Portia,
there's something I want to ask you...

22:12.030 --> 22:14.565
...and I know
this is all a bit abrupt.

22:14.566 --> 22:15.636
Yes?

22:17.869 --> 22:21.872
Do you think you have room
for one more in your life?

22:21.873 --> 22:23.541
One more what?

22:23.542 --> 22:26.785
One more person.

22:27.079 --> 22:31.048
Oh John,
that's so sweet.

22:31.049 --> 22:33.250
But you seem
like a great guy too.

22:33.251 --> 22:34.552
And you can handle an axe...

22:34.553 --> 22:38.389
...and you know,
you have a very nice nose and your...

22:38.390 --> 22:40.057
...face,
but I have a long-term boyfriend.

22:40.058 --> 22:42.193
Long, long,
long-term.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.228
And you know, we are happy.
We're very happy.

22:44.229 --> 22:45.730
We're so...

22:45.731 --> 22:46.709
haPPY-

22:47.099 --> 22:50.167
Wow, happy is one of those words
that if you say it...

22:50.168 --> 22:53.304
...a lot, it loses its meaning.
Like "fork."

22:53.305 --> 22:55.940
Fork. Fork.
Fork. Fork.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.341
Happv- Happy-
Happy- Hapw

22:57.342 --> 22:58.209
Happy. Fork.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.311
It's not...Portia, what I mean-

23:00.312 --> 23:04.658
No, goodbye. Thank you.
This was so much better than kale.

23:05.751 --> 23:08.085
OK.
I'm sorry.

23:08.086 --> 23:09.820
I was going for the cheek.

23:09.821 --> 23:11.689
Yeah!
That's OK.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.624
OK, well,
nice catching up...

23:13.625 --> 23:15.926
...and best of luck
with the application process.

23:15.927 --> 23:17.328
Here is my card.

23:17.329 --> 23:18.796
I have your card.

23:18.797 --> 23:20.398
- I gave you my card?
- Yeah.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.777
That's great.
Then you have my card-

23:30.108 --> 23:31.842
Oh my god.

23:31.843 --> 23:34.478
Sorry, it was there, you know?
You just...

23:34.479 --> 23:35.646
What are you going to do?

23:35.647 --> 23:37.181
- Look, the reason that I'm -
- You look!

23:37.182 --> 23:41.051
I am an admissions officer
and you run a school and I live with someone.“...

23:41.052 --> 23:43.320
...and I've had a really long day...

23:43.321 --> 23:45.389
and I'm exhausted
and this never happened, do you understand?

23:45.390 --> 23:46.926
Portia, no.

23:47.492 --> 23:50.060
Portia, look,
I asked you here for a reason.

23:50.061 --> 23:51.162
And it wasn't to kiss you.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.097
Please communicate
with my associate Ben in the future.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.732
Portia, wait!
Wait, it's just...

23:54.733 --> 23:55.939
I think.-.

23:56.635 --> 23:59.970
I think
maybe Jeremiah's your son.

23:59.971 --> 24:01.172
What?

24:01.173 --> 24:02.673
Jeremiah.

24:02.674 --> 24:05.655
I think maybe he's your son.

24:05.811 --> 24:08.179
Are you
out of your fucking mind?

24:08.180 --> 24:09.580
All right.
Let me rewind.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.582
At Dartmouth,
I was friends with Shelley-

24:11.583 --> 24:14.051
I don't know what you're talking about
and you need to leave.

24:14.052 --> 24:15.853
- Now.
- Portia, wait-

24:15.854 --> 24:17.755
- Jesus!
- She said leave her alone!

24:17.756 --> 24:19.757
What the hell! Morn,
put the gun down!

24:19.758 --> 24:21.759
No means no, asshole.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.329
I have got this under control.
Go inside!

24:25.330 --> 24:28.065
You don't have shit under control.
You never have.

24:28.066 --> 24:30.801
Screw you, mom.
I do so have my life under control!

24:30.802 --> 24:33.204
You could have been somebody,
goddamn it!

24:33.205 --> 24:34.672
You could have been
a trailblazer!

24:34.673 --> 24:35.673
Right, like you?

24:35.674 --> 24:37.741
Holed up here
like some crazy old witch?

24:37.742 --> 24:40.945
You know what?
I'm just going to get into my car, very slowly...

24:40.946 --> 24:43.358
...and let you two chat.

24:44.449 --> 24:46.250
- Portia, I'll call you.
- Please don't-.

24:46.251 --> 24:49.323
Well you're not very good
at returning e-mails.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.557
- You all right?
- Fine.

24:53.558 --> 24:56.026
Watch where you're waving
that thing.

24:56.027 --> 24:58.530
Your breasts are sliding off.

25:01.099 --> 25:02.566
Hi everyone.

25:02.567 --> 25:05.970
Just back from a boring recruitment trip.
Uneventful.

25:05.971 --> 25:07.104
There she is.

25:07.105 --> 25:11.775
So, have you found the finest young minds
in the nation for us?

25:11.776 --> 25:12.776
I'm trying!

25:12.777 --> 25:17.157
Course she has,
she's our golden retriever.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.619
I love this.
I love this bean salad.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.321
It's just so beans
and vinaigrette.

25:24.322 --> 25:27.895
- So simple, but it just works.
- Yeah, beans.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.362
Oh, hello Helen.
So glad you could make it after all-.

25:31.363 --> 25:35.099
And I can guarantee personally
that next year all your Virginia Woolf seminars...

25:35.100 --> 25:37.268
will be filled with superhumans.

25:37.269 --> 25:40.738
I'll never really understand
your admissions system in America.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.339
Because we just do tests.

25:42.340 --> 25:45.276
You know, we don't really care
about your childhood...

25:45.277 --> 25:47.678
...or your recent conversion
to Buddhism.

25:47.679 --> 25:50.047
Gray matter,
that's what counts.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.250
Helen, would you mind putting
the bread on the table?

25:53.251 --> 25:55.891
Thank you so much.

25:57.589 --> 26:00.524
I just...
I want you to know that this...

26:00.525 --> 26:04.200
...us, this life,
it's everything I've always wanted.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.263
Helen, back so soon.

26:06.264 --> 26:08.744
Could you put the salad on?

26:13.038 --> 26:15.780
What's she got against bean salad?

26:17.142 --> 26:18.876
Portia, we need to talk.

26:18.877 --> 26:21.145
I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.

26:21.146 --> 26:22.646
Oh god,
I hate these lunches too.

26:22.647 --> 26:25.093
No, this.
Us.

26:25.884 --> 26:29.086
Is that Helen?
That's weird.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.020
Portia, I'm having twins.

26:30.021 --> 26:32.022
- What are you talking about?
- Twins.

26:32.023 --> 26:35.292
Twins, I'm having twins.

26:35.293 --> 26:36.427
You're talking like a crazy person.

26:36.428 --> 26:41.104
Helen is having twins. My twins.
I'm leaving you.

26:41.666 --> 26:45.035
I'm sorry,
you had sex with that woman?

26:45.036 --> 26:45.736
A bit.

26:45.737 --> 26:50.107
You had unprotected sex
with that vile Virginia Woolf scholar?

26:50.108 --> 26:52.242
There's no need to make a scene.
I'm sorry.

26:52.243 --> 26:54.111
You don't deserve this, you don't.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.347
You're loyal
and a good companion...

26:56.348 --> 26:58.515
- Slop it with the dog stuff!
- What?

26:58.516 --> 26:59.984
I have to go.
Now.

26:59.985 --> 27:03.454
No, you have to slay.
We have guests.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.190
And, we are a family..-unit.

27:06.191 --> 27:07.925
You didn't want a family.

27:07.926 --> 27:11.795
- Neither did you!
- No, that's true. I really don't.

27:11.796 --> 27:15.165
I can't stand babies.
They're repulsive.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.868
Oh god,
she's backing out now.

27:17.869 --> 27:18.669
That's the chicken.

27:18.670 --> 27:21.810
Would you mind, terribly,
taking it out? Goodbye.

27:23.208 --> 27:27.054
I kissed someone!
Almost on purpose!

27:29.648 --> 27:33.917
Mark had an emergency.
A student was...

27:33.918 --> 27:37.021
...having a breakdown
about Robert Frost.

27:37.022 --> 27:40.891
Two roads diverging in a wood
and which to lake.

27:40.892 --> 27:43.460
So, who likes breasts?

27:43.461 --> 27:45.996
Mark loves breasts.
The more the merrier.

27:45.997 --> 27:49.500
In fact, why don't I just put
this aside for him for when he gets home?

27:49.501 --> 27:53.142
So who likes legs?
Well, Mark likes legs.

27:53.705 --> 27:56.948
Who likes assholes?
I guess that's me.

27:58.576 --> 28:03.576
Virginia Woolf was a twat.
Extremely overrated.

28:03.715 --> 28:06.093
No Gertrude Stein.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.691
I'll have a breast, please.

28:15.060 --> 28:16.630
Oh god.

28:16.828 --> 28:20.537
God dammit.
Dammit!

28:28.106 --> 28:29.813
Excuse me.

28:30.308 --> 28:33.243
This is your mother?

28:33.244 --> 28:34.746
Yes.

28:35.280 --> 28:39.016
I saw her lecture
on Frida Kahlo in 1977.

28:39.017 --> 28:42.219
She was extremely hot.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.221
OK.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.889
Is she well?
Your mother?

28:45.890 --> 28:47.124
Yeah, she's fine.

28:47.125 --> 28:52.125
Good. Well, thank you for the party.
It was very pleasant.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.832
Everyone is now leaving, OK.

28:54.833 --> 28:59.077
- I shall close this door behind?
- Yes. I'll be right out.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.376
Get to work.

29:37.642 --> 29:42.682
I will always be there for you.
Nothing will ever change that.

30:10.975 --> 30:13.353
Top of the morning, Clarence.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.548
Morning.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.389
If you want to take
a couple personal days...

30:22.086 --> 30:24.191
Why would I?

30:25.290 --> 30:27.825
Everyone knows?

30:27.826 --> 30:30.864
- About Mark, I mean.
- Yes.

30:31.162 --> 30:34.631
And that Woolf woman.

30:34.632 --> 30:37.868
I'm very sorry
about the timing of this...

30:37.869 --> 30:42.239
...bul I want you to know
that I am here for you one thousand percent.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.442
This is my life.
It's what I'm good at.

30:45.443 --> 30:46.743
I know.

30:46.744 --> 30:50.113
And please, rest assured,
that nothing...

30:50.114 --> 30:52.416
...will affect my work.
Nothing.

30:52.417 --> 30:56.365
Well that's great.
You just carry on.

31:05.830 --> 31:09.141
And that
was the famous Blair Arch.

31:10.668 --> 31:13.604
Here comes one of our illustrious
Admissions officers.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.739
Clearly a very busy time
for you all.

31:15.740 --> 31:19.710
Any words of wisdom
for hopefully future Princelonians?

31:19.711 --> 31:22.282
- What?
- Words of wisdom?

31:23.248 --> 31:26.817
Just...
gel those applications in and...

31:26.818 --> 31:29.219
...remember to be yourself,
because...

31:29.220 --> 31:32.133
...who else could you be?
That's...

31:32.290 --> 31:34.531
.-.that's who you're stuck with.

31:35.526 --> 31:40.063
OK. You got the idea.
Let's keep moving!

31:40.064 --> 31:42.633
Any budding astrophysicists
in the crowd?

31:42.634 --> 31:44.434
Because I've got a treat
for you next!

31:44.435 --> 31:47.437
Jeremiah, from Quest.
Hi.

31:47.438 --> 31:49.706
- You remember me?
- Yes. I remember you.

31:49.707 --> 31:51.241
I'm Nelson.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.175
I remember you loo.

31:52.176 --> 31:53.243
I'm John.

31:53.244 --> 31:56.046
Turns out we had a chance to come down
here today, visit the campus.

31:56.047 --> 31:57.047
What a surprise.

31:57.048 --> 31:59.716
It's awesome.
It's like, ancient.

31:59.717 --> 32:02.586
I'm sorry, but what do you think
that you're doing here?

32:02.587 --> 32:05.122
Jeremiah wanted to see the place.
And you and I should talk.

32:05.123 --> 32:06.590
You are out of your mind.

32:06.591 --> 32:07.791
I almost forgot to ask...

32:07.792 --> 32:11.795
Remember when you said
I could spend the night with an undergrad?

32:11.796 --> 32:14.865
Is that still possible?

32:14.866 --> 32:17.134
OK. Yes.
That's possible.

32:17.135 --> 32:20.708
Just catch up with the tour
and meet me back at Admissions.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.524
What are you doing?
You're not allowed in here!

32:40.525 --> 32:41.692
What happened the other night.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.093
Nothing happened the other night.

32:43.094 --> 32:44.494
Right.
It was nothing.

32:44.495 --> 32:48.068
So don't let it get in the way of this.

32:49.033 --> 32:51.702
This is Jeremiah's
birth certificate.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.104
I knew Shelley.
Your roommate at Dartmouth.

32:54.105 --> 32:55.038
I had a car.

32:55.039 --> 32:57.074
She borrowed it to pick you up
after you had the baby.

32:57.075 --> 32:58.642
Valentine's Day.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.578
Shelley told me you had the baby
at 1pm on Valentine's Day.

33:01.579 --> 33:05.315
That stuck with me.
I hate Valentine's Day-.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.851
- It's a despicable holiday.
- It sucks.

33:07.852 --> 33:09.619
Here's the crazy part.

33:09.620 --> 33:12.155
When Jeremiah applied to Quest,
I saw this and put it together.

33:12.156 --> 33:15.192
It says that he was born
and given up for adoption on Valentine's Day...

33:15.193 --> 33:18.795
1995, 1pm at Blaine Hospital.

33:18.796 --> 33:20.797
I know you didn't ask for this.

33:20.798 --> 33:23.200
And I'm not trying to ruin your life.

33:23.201 --> 33:24.668
But I care about this kid...

33:24.669 --> 33:28.405
and I think he could use a
little more connection in his life.

33:28.406 --> 33:31.074
But I didn't tell him anything.
It's your decision-.

33:31.075 --> 33:32.884
I'm
just setting it up.

33:34.545 --> 33:39.216
He has his parents.
He has you, right? Nelson?

33:39.217 --> 33:41.752
Yeah, his parents are great people.
But we're moving on...

33:41.753 --> 33:43.220
.-.Nelson and me.

33:43.221 --> 33:44.955
Hey, maybe it was meant to be.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.156
Nothing is meant to be.

33:46.157 --> 33:48.792
And you don't just barrel into
other people's lives like this.

33:48.793 --> 33:50.193
This is bad form.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.829
- This is bad form.
- Bad form.

33:52.830 --> 33:54.031
I am not a project.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.343
I am not some village in need
of a water system.

33:57.769 --> 34:01.080
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:01.506 --> 34:04.419
John Pressman.
Quest School.

34:04.575 --> 34:08.445
Clarence Hall, Dean of Admissions.
Princeton.

34:08.446 --> 34:10.847
- It's quite an operation you have here.
- Thank you.

34:10.848 --> 34:13.761
OK.
Well, Mr. Pressman was just leaving.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.554
Right. Of course.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.588
It was nice to meet you.

34:18.589 --> 34:21.391
Hey, I heard about you guys
dropping to number two.

34:21.391 --> 34:22.059
Sorry.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.062
But number two is,
you know, that's good..-too-.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.264
Here's the information
you wanted for your student...

34:27.264 --> 34:29.099
the undergrad
he'll be spending the night with.

34:29.100 --> 34:29.800
Thank you.

34:29.801 --> 34:33.010
And here is the information
you'll need on that student.

34:34.072 --> 34:37.007
Ben, do you mind escorting
Mr. Pressman out?

34:37.007 --> 34:38.341
And Mr. Pressman,
in the future...

34:38.342 --> 34:41.011
e-mail is the appropriate form
of communication.

34:41.012 --> 34:44.880
Right. Sorry.
Yeah. E-mail.

34:44.882 --> 34:49.262
Will do.
All right, see you.

34:50.888 --> 34:53.956
You know,
it's highly unusual...

34:53.958 --> 34:58.495
...it's actually unheard of,
for a school director lo be back here.

34:58.496 --> 34:59.296
I know.

34:59.297 --> 35:03.366
I think we should hire a security guard
to keep the crazies out because...

35:03.367 --> 35:05.540
...it is getting out of control.

35:26.924 --> 35:28.258
New Hampshire Certificate
of Live Birth

35:28.259 --> 35:29.159
CHILD'S NAME:
DOE, JOHN

35:29.160 --> 35:30.230
MOTHER'S CURRENT LEGAL NAME
DOE, JANE

35:44.542 --> 35:45.876
Yo, whassup?

35:45.877 --> 35:49.450
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm looking for my roomie.

35:51.549 --> 35:54.996
- Can I help you?
- You're doing a great job.

35:55.753 --> 35:59.623
So a zombie will move and talk
as if it were awake and genuinely aware...

35:59.624 --> 36:02.292
...of its surroundings,
but its inner light is off.

36:02.293 --> 36:02.826
Right.

36:02.827 --> 36:06.263
And if it is logically possible for a creature
to have a brain just like yours...

36:06.264 --> 36:07.631
...and no conscious experience,

36:07.632 --> 36:11.268
then consciousness
is not literally identical to brain activity.

36:11.269 --> 36:12.145
Exactly!

36:12.436 --> 36:13.608
Exactly!

36:14.172 --> 36:17.374
Hi.
You are not a student.

36:17.375 --> 36:21.111
- What, you're trying to crash or something here?
- Yo, whassup?

36:21.112 --> 36:23.092
L...Hi!

36:25.383 --> 36:28.718
Hi everyone, I'm from Admissions
and we like to come in and..-...

36:28.719 --> 36:31.388
...check on our overnight
high school visitors.

36:31.389 --> 36:33.924
So Jeremiah,
are you warm enough?

36:33.925 --> 36:35.659
Do you have everything
that you need?

36:35.660 --> 36:38.595
Do you need
a Princeton sweatshirt...

36:38.596 --> 36:41.631
or did you remember
to bring your toothbrush?

36:41.632 --> 36:42.999
I'm fine. Thanks.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.734
Good.
What is that?

36:44.735 --> 36:47.404
- This is diet soda?
- Diet soda? Why diet?

36:47.405 --> 36:51.274
- I just like the taste better.
- So do I. That is...unbelievable.

36:51.275 --> 36:52.042
I guess.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.878
Just diet soda?
No...

36:54.879 --> 36:56.213
Yeah. It's just...

36:56.214 --> 36:57.948
Great. Good. Well...

36:57.949 --> 37:00.987
...gel back to your zombie talk.

37:01.686 --> 37:04.189
OK.
Thank you.

37:06.624 --> 37:09.264
Dude, what a cougar.

37:15.700 --> 37:16.872
Shit.

37:20.905 --> 37:21.972
Hi.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.774
You don't happen to actually have
an extra toothbrush on you, do you?

37:24.775 --> 37:27.711
On me? No. No. Why?
You do need a toothbrush?

37:27.712 --> 37:29.157
- Yeah.
- OK.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.880
Soft bristles, right?

37:30.881 --> 37:33.750
That's what kids
- teenagers - your age...

37:33.751 --> 37:35.788
...are supposed to use, right?

37:36.354 --> 37:38.455
I think soft might be
more for baby teeth.

37:38.456 --> 37:39.723
I prefer to
use just a medium.

37:39.724 --> 37:41.591
Yup, don't listen to me.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.994
You'd end up
with a mouthful of cavities.

37:43.995 --> 37:46.796
Hey, how about this rechargeable
toothbrush?

37:46.797 --> 37:48.164
That looks pretty cool.

37:48.165 --> 37:49.266
Yeah, I don't think I need that...

37:49.267 --> 37:53.215
as much as I do appreciate
Thomas the Tank Engine.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.073
I'm an idiot.

37:57.074 --> 37:59.520
You just pick what you need.

38:00.411 --> 38:01.981
Just...

38:02.546 --> 38:04.389
Ok then.

38:05.483 --> 38:06.549
OK...

38:06.550 --> 38:09.463
- Well I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

38:12.556 --> 38:15.594
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.271
Portia?

38:25.770 --> 38:28.683
Are you all right?

38:30.841 --> 38:33.109
I'm fine.
I'm great.

38:33.110 --> 38:34.444
What are you doing here?

38:34.445 --> 38:37.781
Well, we're just up the street.

38:37.782 --> 38:39.728
She said she's fine.

38:39.884 --> 38:41.351
Have you been drinking, Portia?

38:41.352 --> 38:44.120
A little bit.
You know me, I'm a lightweight.

38:44.121 --> 38:45.896
Where are your glasses?

38:46.357 --> 38:49.959
I thought I'd give contacts a try.

38:49.960 --> 38:53.806
Well, all right.
Good to see you.

38:58.035 --> 38:59.742
Oh no.

39:00.571 --> 39:02.949
That's harsh.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.743
Yes.
Yes it is.

39:09.747 --> 39:12.415
- Portia Nathan here.
- Susannah here.

39:12.416 --> 39:15.018
Your mother. Mom.

39:15.019 --> 39:15.952
<i>Mark called.</i>

39:15.953 --> 39:16.886
<i>I know he never liked</i> me...

39:16.887 --> 39:19.022
<i>but he thought you might be in need
of some comfort and guidance.</i>

39:19.023 --> 39:22.225
So, I think this is all a very good thing.

39:22.226 --> 39:25.428
Getting left is a good thing?
Really? I have to go.

39:25.429 --> 39:27.430
Good, you're angry.
You need to express that.

39:27.431 --> 39:29.165
Talk to me.
I'm here for you.

39:29.166 --> 39:30.406
Sweetie.

39:31.702 --> 39:34.904
Well, I actually feel really sad and-

39:34.905 --> 39:38.708
And that is exactly why I knew that night
on the train thirty seven years ago...

39:38.709 --> 39:40.910
...-the man reading
"I'm OK, You're OK".-.

39:40.911 --> 39:42.278
No, please,
not the train story.

39:42.279 --> 39:45.849
I knew I needed his sperm
but I did not need him.

39:45.850 --> 39:48.660
Hey!
Watch yourself, asshole!

39:49.620 --> 39:51.521
Mom. Susannah...

39:51.522 --> 39:54.557
I wanted a child
but not some moody relationship.

39:54.558 --> 39:58.595
Sex with a stranger on the New Jersey Transit
was the answer to my problems.

39:58.596 --> 40:01.164
<i>It's not healthy
to need other people too much.</i>

40:01.165 --> 40:03.867
Now you need to go out
and fall in love with yourself.

40:03.868 --> 40:06.603
- Well I'm going to go do that.
- You go, girl.

40:06.604 --> 40:08.948
Yup.
Going to go buy a train ticket right now.

40:14.678 --> 40:16.521
<i>Please Do Not Disturb</i>

40:17.281 --> 40:19.349
John, it's Portia again.
This is my eighth...

40:19.350 --> 40:21.684
no ninth message.
Please call me back.

40:21.685 --> 40:26.685
It is very important
that you not tell Jeremiah a thing about...

40:27.258 --> 40:28.324
...the thing.

40:28.325 --> 40:31.928
The thing that we were talking about.
Not a word.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.738
Call me back.

40:39.470 --> 40:44.274
<i>Maybe I got a glass eye, but it some from working
in a factory at the age of eleven.</i>

40:44.275 --> 40:46.609
They hooked it out
because they didn't have a shield on the works...

40:46.610 --> 40:49.312
...bul I wear it like a medal
because it tells the world where I belong,

40:49.313 --> 40:51.347
deep down in the working class.

40:51.348 --> 40:52.449
Yeah!

40:52.450 --> 40:54.050
Hey Princeton,
what are you doing?

40:54.051 --> 40:58.855
Just observing the school
so I can better evaluate applicants.

40:58.856 --> 41:00.457
Cool.
I'm cutting class.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.325
Cutting class
is never a good idea.

41:02.326 --> 41:05.528
I hate geography class.
I hate maps.

41:05.529 --> 41:06.863
You hate maps?
Why?

41:06.864 --> 41:09.532
Because you never know
where you'll end up on them.

41:09.533 --> 41:10.700
Not with my dad.

41:10.701 --> 41:14.838
Well, I'm sure your dad has excellent reasons
for living a rootless and impulsive life.

41:14.839 --> 41:15.638
I thought you loved traveling.

41:15.639 --> 41:18.575
I'm sick of traveling.
I love playing Bridge.

41:18.576 --> 41:20.610
Besides, do they even play
Bridge in Ecuador?

41:20.611 --> 41:21.578
No idea.

41:21.579 --> 41:23.546
- How long have you been at Princeton?
- Sixteen years, but-

41:23.547 --> 41:24.948
Wow.
You totally rock.

41:24.949 --> 41:28.251
- Yeah, thanks. Why is that?
- Because you're totally predictable.

41:28.252 --> 41:31.256
So, can you tell me
where I can find your dad?

41:32.456 --> 41:35.525
I've been trying to reach you.
I left you a million messages.

41:35.526 --> 41:36.860
Yeah, well sorry,
I'm a little busy.

41:36.861 --> 41:38.061
What are you doing
to that cow?

41:38.062 --> 41:40.129
The cow's in labor.
I'd shake your hand, but...

41:40.130 --> 41:42.765
- Look, I never told a soul-
- Stay back!

41:42.766 --> 41:44.033
This cow doesn't know you.

41:44.034 --> 41:46.870
Actually, I think we met
the last time I was here.

41:46.871 --> 41:50.707
Do you even know whether Jeremiah
wants to meet his birth mother'?

41:50.708 --> 41:52.509
He wrote an essay
last year entitled...

41:52.510 --> 41:55.211
"Nature versus Nurture:
I wonder who my birth parents are"

41:55.212 --> 41:57.614
Portia the Wise!
Nelson told me you were here.

41:57.615 --> 42:01.451
I just wanted to thank you so much!
I had the best night of my life.

42:01.452 --> 42:03.820
There is nothing I want more in life
than to go to Princeton.

42:03.821 --> 42:05.562
Nothing.

42:07.591 --> 42:08.791
Is something wrong
with that cow?

42:08.792 --> 42:10.560
Where's the goddamn vet!

42:10.561 --> 42:13.363
Well, I'm going to find
my own way out.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.098
Shit!
This isn't right.

42:15.099 --> 42:16.399
This isn't how it looks
on the internet!

42:16.400 --> 42:18.401
- OK, bye now. Best of luck with all that.
- Come back!

42:18.402 --> 42:19.736
Grab her head.
Calm her down.

42:19.737 --> 42:21.337
No, you said stay back.

42:21.338 --> 42:22.908
I changed my mind!

42:26.810 --> 42:31.054
- She looks so mad.
- Well she's probably protecting her young.

42:31.649 --> 42:33.993
Hey there, little mama.

42:34.418 --> 42:36.953
It's all going to be OK. Just...

42:36.954 --> 42:39.222
...just focus on your breath.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.224
Your terrible, terrible breath.

42:41.225 --> 42:44.694
Think how lucky you are
not to be on a beef ranch right now.

42:44.695 --> 42:47.730
I'm sorry,
that was inappropriate.

42:47.731 --> 42:50.567
Where is the bull
that did this to you?

42:50.568 --> 42:52.569
He's probably out partying
with his friends.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.571
She's clamping again!
Jeremiah, get back here!

42:54.572 --> 42:56.439
Please! Fast!

42:56.440 --> 42:59.509
You are not alone.
You are not alone, OK mama?

42:59.510 --> 43:02.312
We're here with you.
You can do this.

43:02.313 --> 43:06.049
Because it happens either way.
It happens either way.

43:06.050 --> 43:08.451
All right, it's coming!
Portia, gel back here, now!

43:08.452 --> 43:09.919
Horrible.

43:09.920 --> 43:13.766
Grab a hoof, grab a hoof.
All right, I'm going to count to three. One...

43:14.992 --> 43:17.632
...two, three, pull!

43:22.733 --> 43:24.303
It's gross!

43:28.339 --> 43:29.539
Boundaries!

43:29.540 --> 43:31.674
Did you not see
my "Do Not Disturb" Sign?

43:31.675 --> 43:32.609
Yeah, I saw it.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.410
But you're not the only one
who reeks of cow placenta.

43:34.411 --> 43:36.613
Why do you have
"Do Not Disturb" signs with you?

43:36.614 --> 43:38.982
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe for times like these.

43:38.983 --> 43:41.017
Here, try this soap.

43:41.018 --> 43:43.152
Look, he's a great kid...

43:43.153 --> 43:46.623
...and you're clearly a great,
mildly compulsive woman.

43:46.624 --> 43:47.423
Take the leap!

43:47.424 --> 43:49.158
I'm sorry,
who's mildly compulsive?

43:49.159 --> 43:51.427
Why do you run around
fixing everyone else's life?

43:51.428 --> 43:52.495
What about yours?

43:52.496 --> 43:55.832
My life is fine, thank you very much.
It's frigging great.

43:55.833 --> 43:57.967
Oh god,
the water just turned to ice!

43:57.968 --> 44:00.236
Whoops, sorry.
Yeah, it's solar powered.

44:00.237 --> 44:01.875
Bit finicky.

44:04.508 --> 44:07.844
Jeremiah has to get
his application in, pronto.

44:07.845 --> 44:08.645
Work on his resume.

44:08.646 --> 44:12.382
A unique talent that demonstrates passion
and commitment would be good.

44:12.383 --> 44:14.384
He has got to get
going on his essay.

44:14.385 --> 44:17.186
And you have to prepare him
for an alumni interview.

44:17.187 --> 44:19.455
You may have built schools
in third world countries...

44:19.456 --> 44:21.457
and cleaned contaminated water
from villages...

44:21.458 --> 44:23.860
...but you have never tried
to get a kid into Princeton.

44:23.861 --> 44:25.995
- Neither have you.
- I am not trying!

44:25.996 --> 44:29.198
I am an Admissions Officer.
I'm just helping you try.

44:29.199 --> 44:33.336
As I would with any outstanding student
who may have been overlooked.

44:33.337 --> 44:35.715
There's nothing improper
going on here.

44:37.608 --> 44:39.609
I am going to exit
the shower stall now.

44:39.610 --> 44:40.677
OK.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.880
Well I'm going to remain in the shower stall
for approximately thirty seconds.

44:43.881 --> 44:45.189
Fantastic.

44:45.616 --> 44:46.749
<i>HEY-</i>

44:46.750 --> 44:48.551
Yes?
How can I help you?

44:48.552 --> 44:50.286
Do you think he has a shot?

44:50.287 --> 44:52.130
Send me his transcripts.

44:53.891 --> 44:53.990
Nelson, take a corner kick.

44:53.991 --> 44:56.528
Nelson, take a corner kick.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.430
What was that?
Do it again.

45:00.431 --> 45:02.165
I'm not good at corner kicks.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.407
Horseshit.
Put your heart into it-.

45:07.504 --> 45:08.971
Hey, Portia-
How you doing?

45:08.972 --> 45:12.842
This is, without a doubt,
the worst transcript I have ever seen.

45:12.843 --> 45:13.509
Switch.

45:13.510 --> 45:16.979
<i>Ds and Fs in ninth,
tenth and eleventh grade?</i>

45:16.980 --> 45:20.450
Suspensions, detentions,
a Special Ed class?

45:20.451 --> 45:21.784
What the hell
were you thinking?

45:21.785 --> 45:22.819
Did you read the rest of it?

45:22.820 --> 45:25.388
Why?
Am I missing a police record?

45:25.389 --> 45:27.390
<i>Come on, man!</i>

45:27.391 --> 45:29.525
Quit half-assing it!

45:29.526 --> 45:32.061
Play like that, those Ecuadorian kids
are going to eat you up.

45:32.062 --> 45:32.595
<i>An right.</i>

45:32.596 --> 45:35.264
Jeremiah got the top score on eight
Advanced Placement tests...

45:35.265 --> 45:38.201
<i>...without ever taking
the Advanced Placement courses?</i>

45:38.202 --> 45:41.003
<i>And his SATs
are almost perfect.</i>

45:41.004 --> 45:43.539
- God, did he...
- Cheat? No.

45:43.540 --> 45:44.874
<i>I insisted
he take those tests.</i>

45:44.875 --> 45:48.211
He's the most brilliant
student I've come across.

45:48.212 --> 45:49.946
- Really?
- Switch!

45:49.947 --> 45:53.149
Regardless, kids like Jeremiah
don't get into Princeton.

45:53.150 --> 45:56.085
He's going to be up against kids
that have resumes fifteen feet long.

45:56.086 --> 45:56.786
So?

45:56.787 --> 45:59.689
<i>Those kids are so burnt out already
all they want to do is get stoned...</i>

45:59.690 --> 46:00.890
<i>and play frisbee
for the rest of their lives.</i>

46:00.891 --> 46:04.093
Princeton would be damn
lucky to have Jeremiah.

46:04.094 --> 46:05.695
Hey, "Fulbol."

46:05.696 --> 46:07.630
"Futbol"
- it's the world's sport, all right?

46:07.631 --> 46:08.731
Put some
heart into it!

46:08.732 --> 46:10.233
Did you get
that other thing I sent you?

46:10.234 --> 46:12.475
- In the box?
- What?

46:17.975 --> 46:19.818
World's Greatest Mom

46:20.244 --> 46:22.912
- Very funny.
- Look, he wants this.

46:22.913 --> 46:23.980
He really wants this.

46:23.981 --> 46:27.019
And I think he would thrive there.
I can see it.

46:27.451 --> 46:30.520
Look, I can't do anything
that could get me into trouble.

46:30.521 --> 46:35.191
But since you're new to the process,
as a professional courtesy, I can...

46:35.192 --> 46:38.528
...send you books, resources,
everything that one might need. OK?

46:38.529 --> 46:40.372
- Great.
- Goodbye.

46:41.231 --> 46:43.232
What the hell was that?

46:43.233 --> 46:46.269
I put my heart into it-
"Futbol."

46:46.270 --> 46:49.410
I'll give you ten bucks
if you can do it again.

46:52.176 --> 46:54.310
They grow up so damn fast,
don't they?

46:54.311 --> 46:57.079
Yeah.
Which one is yours?

46:57.080 --> 46:58.115
Yeah.

47:02.152 --> 47:04.420
<i>How to Talk

47:04.421 --> 47:06.155

47:25.776 --> 47:27.910
- No, I'm just helping.
- What are you doing?

47:27.911 --> 47:29.245
Everybody needs a little help.

47:29.246 --> 47:32.315
- What the hell.
- I'm helping you.

<i>Come on, come on.

<i>Balakian, Jeremiah</i>

47:52.302 --> 47:53.836
When I was eight years old...

47:53.837 --> 47:56.706
I realized my teachers
were not going to be able to teach me.

47:56.707 --> 47:59.709
So I became an autodidact.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.849
I read everything.

48:04.448 --> 48:06.716
<i>I read biographies...</i>

48:06.717 --> 48:10.358
<i>mainly because I didn't know how
other people lived their lives.</i>

48:16.493 --> 48:19.428
<i>I learned several years ago
that I was adopted.</i>

48:19.429 --> 48:23.699
<i>That I was supposed to be the son
that my parents tried so hard to have on their own.</i>

48:23.700 --> 48:28.700
<i>I think my voracious reading came from a deep
longing for something that was missing.</i>

48:28.772 --> 48:30.239
<i>I was searching for someone.</i>

48:30.240 --> 48:31.947
<i>For my story.</i>

48:32.643 --> 48:35.146
<i>To not feel so alone.</i>

48:40.651 --> 48:42.631
Portia?

48:44.788 --> 48:46.989
I knew you were taking
this all rather hard...

48:46.990 --> 48:48.925
but I thought by now
you'd be back on your feet.

48:48.926 --> 48:50.393
What?

48:50.394 --> 48:52.428
It kills me.

48:52.429 --> 48:54.497
It really kills me.
You'll get through this.

48:54.498 --> 48:56.732
- You think-
- I know it seems impossible, but you will.

48:56.733 --> 49:01.537
- No, this has nothing to do with-
- It's OK, it's OK. I understand.

49:01.538 --> 49:03.172
No really.

49:03.173 --> 49:08.452
Christ, I have to go.
Hang on in there.

49:09.313 --> 49:10.246
That's so funny.

49:10.247 --> 49:12.915
Il Forno is one of my favorite
restaurants loo.

49:12.916 --> 49:15.251
- That's amazing.
- I know.

49:15.252 --> 49:18.888
Portia, sweetie.
You feeling all right?

49:18.889 --> 49:20.356
Just terrific, thanks.

49:20.357 --> 49:21.257
Oh good.

49:21.258 --> 49:25.528
Then I think there was an evaluation card
that was placed on the wrong file.

49:25.529 --> 49:27.663
Jeremiah Balakian.

49:27.664 --> 49:29.465
- Balakian.
- Ba...?

49:29.466 --> 49:30.766
Balakian.

49:30.767 --> 49:33.769
- Balakian.
- Balakian.

49:33.770 --> 49:35.071
I think-.

49:35.072 --> 49:39.141
You didn't mean to put
"High Consider," did you?

49:39.142 --> 49:40.678
Let me see-.

49:44.414 --> 49:45.348
No, that's right.

49:45.349 --> 49:47.683
<i>But he has Ds
and Fs and suspensions.</i>

49:47.684 --> 49:51.454
But did you notice that he also got 5s
on all eight AP exams...

49:51.455 --> 49:54.323
.-.without ever taking
any AP courses?

49:54.324 --> 49:57.159
Yes. I'm going to investigate that.
That's impossible.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.227
No, apparently not.

49:58.228 --> 50:02.598
If the child in question is a unique,
special child.

50:02.599 --> 50:05.735
This isn't a child,
it's an applicant.

50:05.736 --> 50:07.837
He's got
no extracurriculars at all.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.672
The counselor at his old high school
said he was shocked...

50:09.673 --> 50:11.407
Jeremiah
was even applying to college.

50:11.408 --> 50:13.142
He's an autodidact.

50:13.143 --> 50:15.678
He's an advanced reader
from the age of eight.

50:15.679 --> 50:20.082
Leonardo DaVinci was an autodidact.
So was Benjamin Franklin-.

50:20.083 --> 50:23.686
Did this Balakian kid
discover electricity or paint the Mona Lisa?

50:23.687 --> 50:25.688
I must have missed that in his file.

50:25.689 --> 50:27.423
He's a great kid.

50:27.424 --> 50:28.732
Portia, dear.

50:28.925 --> 50:30.632
Take a deep breath.

50:30.894 --> 50:33.429
Teamwork, remember?

50:33.430 --> 50:35.698
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

50:35.699 --> 50:38.100
I forgot
you're in a very fragile stale.

50:38.101 --> 50:42.208
Maybe you'd like to step outside
and see how fragile I am.

50:44.241 --> 50:46.642
Only kidding!
Only kidding.

50:46.643 --> 50:51.447
Just a little levity
to enhance the teamwork.

50:51.448 --> 50:53.826
Thank you for your thoughts,
Corrine.

50:57.154 --> 50:58.888
He is never getting in.
Never.

50:58.889 --> 50:59.789
Calm down.

50:59.790 --> 51:01.123
There's something great
I want to show you.

51:01.124 --> 51:03.692
- It turns out Jeremiah was a stale champion-
- In what?

51:03.693 --> 51:05.728
You know what?
It's better if you see it for yourself.

51:05.729 --> 51:08.297
He's going to be doing it
at Nelson's birthday party.

51:08.298 --> 51:11.667
Shows originality, intellectual passion,
everything the books talk about.

51:11.668 --> 51:13.302

Thank god.

51:13.303 --> 51:14.136
Excellent.

51:14.137 --> 51:17.773
<i>So Hi send you the address

51:17.774 --> 51:18.874
It's at my parents' house.

51:18.875 --> 51:21.253
- I'll be there.
- Good.

51:22.479 --> 51:25.289
Is she coming to my party?

51:27.017 --> 51:28.617
Why do you like her so much?

51:28.618 --> 51:30.886
I don't know.
She's weird.

51:30.887 --> 51:34.023
- She is indeed.
- Doesn't matter anyway, right?

51:34.024 --> 51:35.662
Sure it matters.

51:38.161 --> 51:41.764
But, about this Spanish test.

51:41.765 --> 51:43.799
This is your third
"try harder" in a row.

51:43.800 --> 51:46.168
Senora Garcia says
you have an aptitude for languages-

51:46.169 --> 51:47.903
What if I don't?

51:47.904 --> 51:51.073
What if I don't have an aptitude
for languages?

51:51.074 --> 51:53.008
What if I'm not a genius
like Jeremiah?

51:53.009 --> 51:55.778
I don't want you to be a genius.
I'm not a genius.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.379
But I want you to be able
to get by in the world.

51:57.380 --> 51:59.115
- Whatever.
- En espanol.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.892
Whatever. I have class.

52:03.320 --> 52:06.522
Even Becket emerged
from Goebbels' overcoat.

52:06.523 --> 52:08.190
Not to mention Pinter, Janet.

52:08.191 --> 52:09.658
- Professor Polokov.
- Yes?

52:09.659 --> 52:11.794
- Portia Nathan.
- Yes, the sad lady.

52:11.795 --> 52:13.929
The sad lady?
That's not really how I think of myself.

52:13.930 --> 52:15.397
How is your mother?

52:15.398 --> 52:16.732
She's fine.

52:16.733 --> 52:21.733
So I wonder, would you consider conducting
some supplementary admissions interviews?

52:22.339 --> 52:26.208
A scholar of your stature would carry
a huge amount of weight with the committee.

52:26.209 --> 52:29.411
In fact, there's one
extremely unusual applicant...

52:29.412 --> 52:32.214
...who's shown a strong interest
in literature and philosophy-

52:32.215 --> 52:35.284
Why would I want to speak
with a high school student?

52:35.285 --> 52:39.021
Of course, perhaps we could make
some sort of arrangement...

52:39.022 --> 52:41.357
I can't believe you're pimping me.

52:41.358 --> 52:44.493
I'm not "pimping" you.
He's a fan of your writing.

52:44.494 --> 52:46.495
And I need him
to meet this applicant.

52:46.496 --> 52:49.031
Besides, when was the last time
you went to a party?

52:49.032 --> 52:51.033
With racist jockey statues?
Never.

52:51.034 --> 52:53.139
Yeah, those are pretty weird.

52:58.875 --> 53:00.743
Hey Portia,
thanks for coming to my party.

53:00.744 --> 53:02.621
Hey Nelson, happy birthday!

53:03.813 --> 53:05.281
Glad you could make it.

53:05.282 --> 53:07.983
So this is your parents' place?

53:07.984 --> 53:10.519
Yeah, well,
my mom's now.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.788
My dad passed away
a few months ago.

53:12.789 --> 53:14.234
I'm sorry.

53:15.325 --> 53:17.059
It's nice to see you again.

53:17.060 --> 53:19.128
You're not packing heat
by any chance, are you?

53:19.129 --> 53:19.862
Should I be?

53:19.863 --> 53:21.997
No, no, we're all friendlies.

53:21.998 --> 53:23.465
So, what is this?

53:23.466 --> 53:26.202
That is a fossil
from the Jurassic era.

53:26.203 --> 53:29.271
It has been in the same place
for a hundred and fifty million years.

53:29.272 --> 53:30.139
Cool!

53:30.140 --> 53:32.808
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

53:32.809 --> 53:36.412
- Mom, I would like you to-
- I'm Johnny's mother, Mrs. Pressman.

53:36.413 --> 53:38.414
Are you Johnny's girlfriend?

53:38.415 --> 53:39.515
No.
We are friends.

53:39.516 --> 53:41.951
Just friendly acquaintances.
Portia Nathan.

53:41.952 --> 53:43.863
Of course.
What am I thinking?

53:44.054 --> 53:46.455
He can't love anything...

53:46.456 --> 53:49.491
...that's less than
a ten hour ﬂight from JFK.

53:49.492 --> 53:51.493
Maybe we don't have to go,
right Grandma?

53:51.494 --> 53:54.563
- Nelson...
- You're absolutely right, Nelson.

53:54.564 --> 53:58.834
There's nothing wrong
with staying in the same place for a while.

53:58.835 --> 53:59.635
Ask Portia.

53:59.636 --> 54:01.804
She's been in the same job
for sixteen years!

54:01.805 --> 54:03.772
Yeah,
and it's a travesty, Nelson.

54:03.773 --> 54:05.908
Portia was president
of her high school class.

54:05.909 --> 54:06.442
Mom-

54:06.443 --> 54:10.179
She resigned in protest
over funding for the girls' sports program.

54:10.180 --> 54:12.648
She led a school-wide walk out.

54:12.649 --> 54:14.450
And the relevance of all this is?

54:14.451 --> 54:18.988
When you were nine months old,
you could walk.

54:18.989 --> 54:20.055
She actually walked.

54:20.056 --> 54:23.926
I don't mean just stumble walking
like an infant or a toddler...

54:23.927 --> 54:26.061
...she waked with absolute certainty.

54:26.062 --> 54:28.597
One day I saw her
tumble over her shoelaces.

54:28.598 --> 54:31.100
She did not cry.
She didn't fall down.

54:31.101 --> 54:36.101
She sat down, carefully,
and tied her shoelaces in a double knot...

54:36.206 --> 54:39.141
.-.got up and kept going-
At nine months old.

54:39.142 --> 54:40.743
There are a lot
of holes in that story.

54:40.744 --> 54:44.480
You were fearless.
You were born an Amazon.

54:44.481 --> 54:46.081
That's amazing.
I love it.

54:46.082 --> 54:48.217
And what makes you think
she needs your approval?

54:48.218 --> 54:50.486
- I don't.
- OK, that's enough crazytown.

54:50.487 --> 54:53.155
When Johnny
got admitted to Harvard Law...

54:53.156 --> 54:53.822
Oh god.

54:53.823 --> 54:57.026
...he decided to go
and live in Outer Mongolia instead.

54:57.027 --> 54:57.559
Yeah.

54:57.560 --> 54:58.494
Outer Mongolia.

54:58.495 --> 55:00.896
You know what, Portia, I'm with you.
Enough crazytown.

55:00.897 --> 55:04.366
Have another vat of gin, Mom.

55:04.367 --> 55:06.101
- Ms. Nathan.
- Yes?

55:06.102 --> 55:07.945
Vladimir Polokov.

55:13.610 --> 55:16.812
You are just as beautiful today
as you were thirty years ago.

55:16.813 --> 55:18.647
I just had a mastectomy.

55:18.648 --> 55:21.686
I was just translated into Finnish.

55:23.453 --> 55:25.721
Brilliant.

55:25.722 --> 55:27.323
Can I gel you some iced lea?

55:27.324 --> 55:29.491
Or something stronger perhaps?

55:29.492 --> 55:31.060
Why not.

55:31.061 --> 55:32.261
I'll stroll with you-.

55:32.262 --> 55:35.064
I would love to.
It would be a pleasure.

55:35.065 --> 55:39.868
It was a pleasure.
Your lawn jockeys are just...outstanding.

55:39.869 --> 55:41.576
Yeah, aren't they fun?

55:44.407 --> 55:49.857
And now, with a special performance
for Nelson on his big day.

55:52.349 --> 55:55.417
Performing the act
that won him honorable mention...

55:55.418 --> 55:57.219
at the New Hampshire Slate
Championships.

55:57.220 --> 55:59.063
Put your hands together...

56:00.290 --> 56:02.668
Put your hands together!

56:03.793 --> 56:06.831
For Jeremiah Balakian!

56:10.166 --> 56:12.942
I want to dedicate
this performance to Nelson.

56:13.103 --> 56:15.083
Happy birthday, pal.

56:15.905 --> 56:18.440
Honorable mention,
I thought you said he won.

56:18.441 --> 56:19.775
He was robbed.

56:19.776 --> 56:21.243
This is my other friend...

56:21.244 --> 56:23.112
...Rene Descartes.

56:23.113 --> 56:26.448
- Say "Hello, Rene."
- Hello, Rene.

56:26.449 --> 56:28.429
How are you, Rene?

56:29.519 --> 56:34.025
I think, therefore I am.

56:36.059 --> 56:39.261
Did you say you're pink,
therefore you're ham?

56:39.262 --> 56:41.397
Do you have any advice
for a young man, Rene?

56:41.398 --> 56:42.998
Whatever you do...

56:42.999 --> 56:47.106
...don't put the horse before...

56:47.670 --> 56:49.911
"Descartes.

56:52.475 --> 56:57.117
Do you guys want to see Descartes
philosophize backwards?

56:57.547 --> 57:00.215
I think, therefore I am.

57:00.216 --> 57:02.484
Oh god.

57:02.485 --> 57:04.863
That's terrible.

57:09.159 --> 57:10.426
What was that?

57:10.427 --> 57:12.761
Come on,
that showed originality, depth-

57:12.762 --> 57:13.829
Are you kidding me?

57:13.830 --> 57:16.765
Here from the island of misfit toys
is Jeremiah Balakian.

57:16.766 --> 57:18.100
Are those birds?

57:18.101 --> 57:19.435
Those are doves.

57:19.436 --> 57:20.636
For the party?

57:20.637 --> 57:22.638
No, you know,
my morn has a dove room.

57:22.639 --> 57:25.974
By the way,
I know that wasn't a perfect showcase...

57:25.975 --> 57:27.843
but he can't pretend
to be somebody he's not.

57:27.844 --> 57:29.745
Yes he can.
You should try it sometime.

57:29.746 --> 57:31.914
It's how humans behave here
on planet earth.

57:31.915 --> 57:33.715
I know how humans
behave on planet earth...

57:33.716 --> 57:36.452
because I've actually lived
a few places on planet earth-.

57:36.453 --> 57:38.120
Wait!
Here, help me out.

57:38.121 --> 57:39.388
Aren't you ready yet?

57:39.389 --> 57:41.890
- I'm lighting them as fast as I can.
- Hurry up!

57:41.891 --> 57:43.459
Do you like the cake?

57:43.460 --> 57:44.660
It's very patriotic.

57:44.661 --> 57:46.231
Nelson's idea.

57:46.930 --> 57:49.331
How many frigging candles
are on this cake?

57:49.332 --> 57:50.367
Fifty.

57:50.667 --> 57:51.867
It was my mom's idea.

57:51.868 --> 57:54.536
Polokov was looking
at Jeremiah like he had two heads.

57:54.537 --> 57:56.004
Well that's his problem, isn't it!

57:56.005 --> 57:59.475
Look, I want Jeremiah to go to Princeton
because he wants to go to Princeton...

57:59.476 --> 58:00.809
and I actually think
he'd do great there...

58:00.810 --> 58:03.212
.-.but if he doesn't get in to Princeton,
if he gets in to another school-..

58:03.213 --> 58:04.279
Well that's fine loo.

58:04.280 --> 58:05.747
Because where you went to school...

58:05.748 --> 58:08.283
and what your background is,
that's just a box and I reject it.

58:08.284 --> 58:10.924
I reject being put into a box.
OK?

58:18.161 --> 58:19.895
- Hi.
- Hi, morn.

58:19.896 --> 58:21.739
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

58:28.771 --> 58:32.908
Mr. and Mrs. Balakian,
I'm Portia Nathan.

58:32.909 --> 58:37.513
I want to say thank you so much for everything that
you have done for this boy.

58:37.514 --> 58:39.494
You're wonderful people.

58:41.784 --> 58:44.287
She's from Princeton.

58:45.121 --> 58:46.989
Well, you're welcome.

58:46.990 --> 58:48.560
I love you.

58:48.992 --> 58:50.699
OK.

58:50.994 --> 58:52.701
Bye.

59:02.071 --> 59:03.138
Portia?

59:03.139 --> 59:04.473
What are you doing here?

59:04.474 --> 59:05.941
I want to come live with you!

59:05.942 --> 59:08.877
Why in god's name
would you want to live with me?

59:08.878 --> 59:11.947
Because you're a normal,
boring adult.

59:11.948 --> 59:13.549
I bet you'd take me
to Chuck E. Cheese.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.551
What makes you think
I'm so boring?

59:15.552 --> 59:17.286
You just are.

59:17.287 --> 59:17.953
It's good.

59:17.954 --> 59:19.855
At your age,
you're supposed to be boring.

59:19.856 --> 59:21.290
I'm the same age
as your dad!

59:21.291 --> 59:22.624
Tell him that!

59:22.625 --> 59:25.027
- Hello?
- John, it's Portia. I have Nelson.

59:25.028 --> 59:26.495
- <i>You do?</i>
- <i>He's fine.</i>

59:26.496 --> 59:28.096
- He is?
- Yes. He's fine.

59:28.097 --> 59:29.269
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

59:37.040 --> 59:40.509
Nelson, you know how much
I love this statue, right?

59:40.510 --> 59:41.476
Yeah.

59:41.477 --> 59:46.148
You rode a horse three days
through Outer Mongolia in the pouring rain...

59:46.149 --> 59:48.450
...living off
mare's milk to bring it back.

59:48.451 --> 59:49.718
That's right.

59:49.719 --> 59:54.759
And I've dragged it place to place,
across the world ever since I was twenty two.

59:57.994 --> 01:00:01.730
That is nothing compared
to how much I love you.

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:04.266
Please don't scare me
like that again.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.668
Why?
You do it all the time?

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:07.869
Hide out in cars?

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:09.204
Run away!

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.339
I'll never run away from you.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.942
And going across the world
and helping people is not running away.

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:17.713
I know, but why
can't we ever just do what I want?

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:20.182
Because you are a kid.
I am an adult.

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:24.598
What I say in this house goes!

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:36.141
This parenthood thing...

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.567
...well, it's a disaster.

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:40.302
So I hear.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:44.172
I'm screwing it up.
Am I? Screwing it up?

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:45.240
You're asking me?

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:48.176
I don't know, it's just,
Nelson and I have always travelled.

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:50.579
I wanted to give him the kind of life
I didn't have as a kid.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.180
I wanted to give him
the opposite of what I had as a kid...

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:54.583
but now all of a sudden
he's turning into my mother.

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:57.919
You know, he plays Bridge.
He listens to Lite FM.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.324
He asked for a blue blazer with gold buttons
and anchors on them for Christmas.

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:03.792
Does your mom
wear blue blazers?

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.670
No, that was my father.

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:08.196
How is it possible?

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:10.198
What am I doing wrong?

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:11.800
At least you're trying.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:14.736
I mean, there's so many
different kinds of parents.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:17.377
There's no one best way to do it.

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.141
Or so I have gathered...

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:22.885
with my vast experience
reading personal essays.

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:28.721
Speaking of which, I have
fifteen essays to get through tonight, so...

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:36.091
Well thank you
for bringing him back.

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.400
Of course.

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:41.531
So you really are leaving,
aren't you?

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:43.671
In a month and a half.

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:56.079
- I thought-
- Let's just not think for a while.

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:57.954
Great.

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:32.787
Hey Portia.

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:36.384
Are you going to be my mom?

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:38.126
What? No.

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:41.193
Just messing with you.

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:43.604
Right. Go back to sleep.

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:47.206
Guess you're not so boring after all-.

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:06.181
- Good morning.
- Hi.

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:08.316
Did you stay over?

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:10.185
Too long
of a drive back to campus?

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:11.756
I slept on the sofa.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.298
So did your mother.

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:16.992
We did not make it
all the way to the bedroom.

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.460
I didn't need to know that.

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.996
Interesting.
Unique, I would say.

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:22.464
Really, that's enough information.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.599
The boy. Jeremiah.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.067
The ventriloquism...

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:29.271
Weird- I liked it.

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:31.807
- I will write a recommendation.
- Thank you!

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.049
Thank you, sad lady.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.742
Mom?

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:02.209
Mom?

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:07.820
What are you doing here?

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:12.113
I wanted to tell you something.

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:13.181
I know.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:15.717
You slept with that guy,
didn't you?

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:16.918
I did.

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.024
Then we both got lucky.

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:22.365
Yeah.
He's leaving.

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:25.838
It's OK. It's good.

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:26.795
It is good.

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:29.397
You don't need
any commitments right now.

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.036
It's perfect.

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:32.934
No.

01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:35.470
Honey, I'm exhausted.

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:39.248
That old Russian guy
gave me a workout.

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.855
Just take a nap.

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.790
Just for a bit.

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:51.060
Actually,
I've got to hit the road.

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:51.613
Next victim!

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:54.683
Good luck with the fencing finals,
Sebastian.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:57.018
It was a pleasure to meet you.

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:58.726
Thank you so much.

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:01.524
- Hi there.
- Hi.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.927
This is Jeremiah Balakian.

01:06:05.928 --> 01:06:08.196
Good to meet you.
Are you Mr. Balakian?

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:08.630
No.

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.765
His parents couldn't make it.
I'm his teacher.

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.473
Yeah,
you look like a teacher.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:15.170
Might want to tuck that in, son.

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:17.572
So, Jeremiah, why don't you come
into my torture chamber...

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:20.075
...we'll have a chat and you can tell me
why you want to go to Princeton.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.977
I rode crew.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.891
Class of eighty-one.
Lot's changed since then.

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:28.917
Hey.
This kid, he's terrific.

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:30.885
Yeah. Great.

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:33.455
No, I mean he's authentic.

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:36.658
He doesn't want to just go to Princeton
to meet future business partners.

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:39.995
He loves learning
for the sake of learning.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:42.237
That's what it's about,
isn't it?

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.401
Right.

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:48.937
Why don't you go get yourself
a cup of coffee.

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.578
Yeah, great.
Thanks.

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.786
- Prick.
- Excuse me?

01:06:57.213 --> 01:07:01.216
I just called you a prick.
I'm sorry.

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:04.664
Don't take it out on him.
It's my own thing.

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:09.624
That's not very nice.

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:10.797
I know.

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:14.799
So, Jeremiah,
tell me about yourself-.

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:21.102
Myself as in, you know,
in relation to my soul or...

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:25.106
...do you mean myself as like a unified person
as the source of consciousness?

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:29.078
Or do you mean myself
like a narrative center of gravity?

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:31.479
How bad was it?

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.782
I'm not supposed to discuss
alumni recommendations.

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:34.849
<i>It was that bad?</i>

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:36.384
Can we get him
a second alumni interview?

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:37.519
I'm afraid not.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.387
<i>Tomorrow,
the committee meetings begin...</i>

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:41.523
...and...look, I've got to go home
and get some sleep.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.258
<i>It's the last chance
I'm going to have for three weeks.</i>

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.393
Your meetings
last three weeks?

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:47.395
- I have to go.
- Right.

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:48.568
Bye.

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:12.887
I have spoken
to the Judo Association and...

01:08:12.888 --> 01:08:16.461
...they have no record
of his "national championship.'

01:08:16.524 --> 01:08:18.526
<i>DENY</i>

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:20.506
Thank you. Goodbye.

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:27.635
I just want to say thank you.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:32.636
I've tried to put
on a brave front about M-M-

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:36.511
I can't even say his name.

01:08:36.511 --> 01:08:38.212
- Mark.
- Yes. Him.

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:39.591
And honestly...

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:43.685
...you're the only person
who has really been so sensitive...

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:47.292
...to what I'm going through
and I appreciate it so much.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.294
Men can be such pigs.

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:53.968
People are all pigs.

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:58.104
OK, yes.
I'm with you on that.

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.314
Oh no-

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:10.278
Maybe we can declare
a truce, because...

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:15.216
...we women have to stick together
in this man eat woman...

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:17.457
...dog eat bitch world.

01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:20.529
Sisterhood.

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:24.533
You are so right.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:29.734
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:34.435
Friends, today...

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:36.837
...we begin
the process of choosing...

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:41.879
...the most remarkable freshman class
in Princeton history.

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:48.827
Here is the order of territories,
chosen randomly.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:52.288
We begin with the West.

01:09:52.587 --> 01:09:54.568
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:56.991
Corrine, are you ready?

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:58.699
Yes.

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:01.162
Yulia Karasov.

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:06.163
Class rank two of four hundred and fifty,
magnet school in a suburb of San Diego.

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:09.270
Her family emigrated
from Russia ten years ago.

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:13.541
She's captain of the cross-country team,
sports editor of the school paper.

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:17.946
Math 760,
Critical Reading 710, Writing 740.

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:19.681
But the recs aren't special.

01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:23.151
They admire her,
but they don't love her.

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:26.599
Show of hands for acceptance.

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:31.531

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:36.364

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:37.699
Sylvia Hadlock.

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.766
Applying from Los Angeles...

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:41.402

from our beautiful stale of New Jersey.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.483
Alice Copley.

01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:59.053
Her dream is to be a prosecutor,
then serve on the Supreme Court.

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:01.522
Alice's mother was murdered.

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:04.058
The murderer got off on a technicality.

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:05.793
Alice would like to retry him...

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:07.637
...and put him away for life.

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:11.069
Though she would prefer
the death penalty.

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:13.735
Excellent extracurriculars.

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:18.206
Twenty-two twenty
combined SAT. 4.2 GPA

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:22.710
I'm a little concerned about a revenge
fantasy fueling her academics.

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:26.853
Portia, you were second reader.
I see you put "Maybe"

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:29.550
I might have
underestimated her passion...

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:32.787
...upon first reading,
as we all sometimes do.

01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:36.424
I think this girl's
self-knowledge is impressive.

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:38.234
She's an excellent candidate.

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:41.570
Vote.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.635
Very good.

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:48.376
<i>ACCEPT</i>

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:56.689
Dashiel Weld Broward.

Fourth generation legacy.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.019
Four point oh.

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:04.319
Captain of his sailing club.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.055
He led them to victory
three years in a row.

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:08.091
SATs?

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:10.992
660, 710, 600-.

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:13.328
He's just one of those kids
that doesn't test well.

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.531
But, oh,
can he read the wind.

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:20.068
So what you're saying
is that an unusual candidate's strengths...

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:23.204
...in some areas
really do outweigh major...

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:26.846
...and I mean
major - weakness elsewhere.

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:29.852
Yes.

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:32.613
Well let's vote then.

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.252
For acceptance?

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:42.525
Aput Kunayak

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.625

to take five AP classes...

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:47.829
...while working
on his father's reindeer farm and...

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:52.567
.-.starting and running a shelter
for homeless sled dogs-.

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:54.969
Had suffered
from ADD but overcame it...

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.505
...to become a leader
in his high school.

01:12:57.506 --> 01:13:00.375
He'd be the first
in his family to attend college.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:05.376
Now Ben, as you know, we have room
for very few of these "iffy" students.

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:09.427
But then again, we have to make room
for the exceptional, right?

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:11.554
Let's vote.

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:27.142
Aput Kunayak.

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:32.184
Are you going
to give me the file?

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:35.109
And last,
we come to the end.

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:37.111
The Northeast.

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:40.491
Portia, please begin.

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:42.728
Thank you.

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:48.089
Richard Guinness.

Chess club,

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:02.873
...member of the team
but not a leader.

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:06.507
Backbone
of the Woodwinds section...

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:08.443
...was the highest praise he got.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:12.213
He is the kind of student
you could always call upon...

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:15.316
...-to help with
Martin Luthor King Day activities-.

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:16.591
Who isn't?

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:21.789
That's twenty eight
denies in a row.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.892
Come on, Portia.
Make us fall in love.

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.668
OK. Let's see.

01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:34.581
Jeremiah Balakian.

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:41.943
Jeremiah is our first applicant
from Quest...

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:43.845
...a new school
in New Hampshire.

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:46.714
Developmental,
but academically rigorous.

01:14:46.715 --> 01:14:48.549
Jeremiah is an only child.

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:51.152
Parents both work
at a Stop N Go.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.354
Neither
of them attended college.

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:56.097
The first three years
of his high school life were...

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:58.230
...a disaster.

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.168
If you're wondering
why you are even listening to this...

01:15:01.263 --> 01:15:06.263
Jeremiah is also a self-described
autodidact since the age of eight.

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:07.535
He's very well read.

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:10.705
In fact, he's the most well read
person I have met.

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:11.810
Ever.

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:15.443
And why?
For his resume?

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:17.044
To impress someone?

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:21.755
For the sake of learning.
His passion for knowledge.

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:26.087
He had no plans to attend college
until this past fall...

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.522
...when he switched to Quest...

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:32.523
...and came into contact with teachers
who recognized his potential.

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:37.832
Last spring,
he took the SATs and eight AP tests.

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:40.601
Wail, so he took AP classes?

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:44.071
No AP classes.
No SAT prep courses.

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:47.308
But he got 5's on all eight APs.

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:52.309
And 790, 780
and 790 on the SATs.

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:55.182
- That's amazing.
- I'm sorry, what did you say?

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:57.118
- That's amazing.
- Amazing.

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.292
It's amazing.
Exactly.

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:03.257
Do you think he can handle
an intense academic community?

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:03.991
Thank you.

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:05.626
- That's a great question, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:07.962
The director
of his new school says...

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:10.831
...he is idiosyncratic,
cerebral...

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:15.036
.-.a true original whose abilities
would lift the level of discourse.“...

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:16.771
...in any class he enrolled in.

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:19.006
You seem...
passionate about him.

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:19.941
I am.

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:24.879
So what was his GPA?
I mean, before Quest?

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.548
D plus.
One point five.

01:16:27.549 --> 01:16:29.617
He was a lost kid.

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:31.996
And then he was found.

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:37.391
So Corrine, you were second reader.
I see you wrote "Deny."

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:39.167
Any second thoughts?

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:45.778
Well, he is like no other applicant
we have ever considered.

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.869
His alumni interview
was not so great.

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:51.214
That guy sounded like a jerk.

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:57.011
And he has a positive
recommendation...

01:16:57.012 --> 01:17:00.425
...from no less of a scholar
than Vladimir Polokov.

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:08.222
OK, maybe from our perspective
he could have done more...

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:12.927
...made himself more of a resume
and paper trail.

01:17:12.928 --> 01:17:17.431
But he look himself
from nowhere to where he is today.

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:21.938
He educated himself
purely by instinct.

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:25.250
Not because he wants
to put away his mother's killer.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:29.777
He was as isolated
as someone in Nome, Alaska.

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:31.052
He was alone.

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:33.483
He was completely alone.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.984
And you know,
maybe if his parents had been rich...

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.965
he would have been exposed
to more.

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:42.894
We have to make room
for these kids.

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:53.736
We have to make room
for kids like these.

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:59.106
Clarence, you told us
at the beginning of the year...

01:17:59.107 --> 01:18:01.986
to find that undiscovered gem.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.958
I found him.

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:14.588
Well, let's vote.

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:17.229
All in favor of admission?

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:38.946
He also received an honorable mention
at the state finals for ventriloquism.

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:40.585
We're in the middle of a vole.

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:46.193
Brandt?

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.924
I'm sorry, Portia.

01:18:49.925 --> 01:18:53.427
I just think he's got
a little too much to overcome.

01:18:53.428 --> 01:18:56.597
I mean,
the kid was in Special Ed.

01:18:56.598 --> 01:19:00.000
I know sometimes we subconsciously
identity with applicants...

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:03.073
...who remind us of ourselves,
but honey, no.

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:07.112
OK then.

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:08.676
Pen)'-

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:11.979
Wait!
Polokov called him inspirational!

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.688
Portia, please.
Sit down.

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:23.993
It's too risky.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.931
He's just not Princeton material.

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:34.010

that you thought he was.

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:05.726
Portia Nathan.

01:21:05.727 --> 01:21:08.708
<i>Hey, this is Bob Barrow
from Hotchkiss.</i>

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:12.199
<i>I wanted to talk to you
about one of our applicants.</i>

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.401
All decisions have been made.

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:18.272
<i>Yes, but I wanted you to know
that Jesse Bolton is going to Yale.</i>

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:20.140
<i>Definitely.
He was just in here.</i>

01:21:20.141 --> 01:21:23.520
<i>Even though he's a legacy,
he's definitely going to Yale.</i>

01:21:24.346 --> 01:21:27.014
<i>So look,
if you accepted him...</i>

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:29.016
<i>maybe that place can go
to another of our students?</i>

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:32.055
<i>Instead of Jesse
just rejecting Princeton.</i>

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:35.956
Thank you for your call,
but all decisions are absolutely final.

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:37.937
No changes can be made.

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:39.670
Yes, but-

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:09.166
<i>Password</i>

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:14.900
Love, Aleksai

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:16.031
Aleksai.

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:29.447
<i>Final Accept-Deny</i>

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:37.057
Bolton, Jesse

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:44.469
Balakian, Jeremiah

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.565
I'm sorry you feel that way.

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:26.934
No, there isn't
an appeals process.

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:29.603
How wonderful that Elissa
got so many acceptances.

01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:31.982
Harvard and Yale too?

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:36.343
Listen, I'd love to talk to you
about the financial aid package we could offer.

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:39.213
No seriously,
I'm so happy too.

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:41.125
No, you rock.

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:44.485
Yes,
I know he is a legacy...

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:46.754
...and I certainly understand
why you would never want to give...

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.928
another penny
to this university ever again.

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:53.133
Wow.
That is a new one.

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:56.374
<i>You're our angel on earth</i>

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:03.850
<i>I hope you get rectal cancer</i>

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:12.179
Portia Nathan.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.660
Hey, I have somebody here
who wants to talk to you.

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:18.118
- I got in.
- Yes, I know.

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:20.921
This is the best day of my life!

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:23.368
The best day of your life?
Well that's...

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:26.667
...good, good,
that's...I'm very happy.

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:31.398
<i>Look, we're having
a school dance here tonight...</i>

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:33.845
and I think
you should come and celebrate.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:39.573
There you are.
Clarence wants to see you.

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:42.443
Yes, thank you.
I've been expecting that.

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:44.720
I have to go.
I'll call you later.

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:47.652
Have a seal, please.

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:04.071
- So, I had a call.
- Oh yes?

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:06.642
From Richard Bolton.

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:09.042
Class of '81.

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:11.538
Father of Jesse Bolton.

01:25:11.539 --> 01:25:13.574
Do you recall Jesse Bolton?

01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:14.842
Budding journalist...

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:18.312
writes for the Boston Globe -
is this coming back?

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:21.281
I remember Jess Bolton.
We loved Jesse Bolton.

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:22.683
We accepted Jesse Bolton.

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:24.027
And yet...

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:30.357
So I asked for the admit list.

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:32.759
Looked for Bolton, Jesse.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.328
No Bolton, Jesse.

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:38.106
But I did find Balakian, Jeremiah.

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:44.271
We sent Mr. Balakian an offer of admission,
which he accepted.

01:25:44.272 --> 01:25:45.672
The only thing is...

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:48.342
I don't remember
making him an offer of admission.

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:51.916
But I do remember
your plea that we do so.

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.948
You have exposed this office...

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:58.852
...and the University
to a completely undeserved scandal.

01:25:58.853 --> 01:26:04.667
If word of this were ever to get out,
the damage would be irreparable.

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:07.329
Well, I won't tell anyone.

01:26:07.862 --> 01:26:11.198
That's right.
You won't.

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:14.401
What you will do
is submit your resignation...

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:17.971
...and take this week
to clear up your affairs.

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:19.315
And then...

01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:23.186
...I don't ever want to see you
in this building again.

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:32.854
He's going to Yale.

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:35.026
Jesse Bolton.

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:38.525
The guidance counselor called me.
We never had a shot at him.

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:39.596
Yale!

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:42.129
Well,
that's not the point.

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:44.398
I assume
you will be standing by the offer?

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:46.133
Well I don't see
how we can rescind it...

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:49.102
without the whole thing
blowing up in our faces.

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:51.310
The whole system
would be questioned.

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.513
We wouldn't
want that to happen.

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:13.772
Yeah?

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:19.141
Oh hi,
glad you're here.

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:22.414
I was just coming down
to the dance.

01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:30.510
- You OK?
- Yeah, why?

01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:33.046
- You just seem kind of intense.
- I'm OK, are you OK?

01:27:33.047 --> 01:27:34.958
Yeah, I'm great.

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:38.919
I'm supposed
to be chaperoning this dance.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.695
You're doing a great job.

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:00.009
You can do this.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.057
You having fun?

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:16.223
This is the best day
of my life.

01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:19.000
You have no idea
how happy that makes me feel.

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:22.838
I want so much for you
to be happy and...

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:26.142
...for you to have all the things
that you want in life.

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:27.844
Thanks.

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:31.972
You know how when you're swinging
on a rope swing across a stream...

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.840
...and you're afraid to jump in
and then you just do?

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:37.110
No, I'm kind of afraid of heights, so...

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:38.351
Me too.
That's...

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:40.418
You and I
have so much in common.

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:44.363
That's not as odd as it seems.

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:49.656
Jeremiah,
there's something I want to tell you...

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:54.163
...and it's going to come
as quite a shock.

01:28:56.397 --> 01:28:58.377
I'm your mother.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.440
- What?
- Your birth mother.

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:06.106
I've been trying to figure out
the best time to tell you...

01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:08.075
and I know,
I was speechless loo.

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:09.316
No, it's not that.

01:29:10.211 --> 01:29:14.047
- It's just...you're not my birth mother.
- Yes, I am.

01:29:14.048 --> 01:29:15.982
And I know this is very sudden
and I don't expect-

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:19.619
No, my birth mother
is named Janie Schroder and.-.

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.861
She's a hairdresser from Keene.

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:27.523
And I met her and my half sisters
a couple months ago.

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.996
I put my name in at the adoption agency
and they contacted me-

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:32.034
No, Jeremiah...

01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:37.333
...you were born on Valentine's Day
at 1pm at Blaine General.

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:38.905
<i>To me.</i>

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:41.408
No, I was born at 11pm.

01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:43.944
They said my mom
tried like hell to hold off till the last hour...

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:46.892
.-.so I wouldn't have some lame
Valentine's Day birthday-.

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.788
It's a copy - see?

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:53.623
That's an eleven
with one of the ones missing.

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:56.801
It's faded, you see?

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:04.731
I never told anybody because I didn't want
my parents to find out.

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:06.734
I was worried
that it would hurt their feelings.

01:30:07.034 --> 01:30:10.072
And I don't want to hurt them,
because they're my parents.

01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:11.813
Of course.

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:16.576
This whole time you thought
you were my mother?

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:17.677
Why didn't you tell me?

01:30:17.678 --> 01:30:21.681
I didn't want anything getting in
the way of you getting into Princeton.

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:23.049
I'd have to recuse myself.

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:25.719
So everything you did
was because you thought I was your son?

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.428
No.
I completely believe in you.

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:31.904
I actually do.

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:35.198
You were lying to me
the whole time.

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:38.606
I don't understand.

01:30:40.067 --> 01:30:42.308
I can't tell what's real.

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:48.683
I don't get it.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.788
- How did it go?
- 11pm, not 1pm!

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.657
- What?
- Just stay out of my life!

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:05.763
Or what's left of it.

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:11.235
Hey!

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.109
Hold on.

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:19.406
Janie Schroder. A hairdresser.
His mother is a hairdresser.

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:22.786
What?
No, I read the birth certificate.

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:26.055
A copy.
A faded copy.

01:31:30.084 --> 01:31:31.791
- Look!
- What?

01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:35.555
Eleven.
That is supposed to be an eleven.

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:38.592
None of this was true.
This is all a stupid dream.

01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:42.095
This is all in your head
and I just jumped in like a complete idiot.

01:31:42.096 --> 01:31:45.398
I can fix this.
I'll contact adoption services-

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:46.266
No!

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:50.170
Do not fix anything!
I don't want to ever see you again!

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:52.506
Go be a citizen
of the planet!

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:55.375
I am so glad that you are going to Ecuador
except for one thing.

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:56.109
What?

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:59.284
I feel sorry
for the Ecuadorians!

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:35.955
Hi. Come on in.
You can help me grind sausage.

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:39.152
I've got something to say,
Susannah.

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:43.023
Having sex on a train with a stranger
to gel pregnant - really not so great!

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:44.758
You didn't even ask his name.

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:47.027
And so I will never know
who my father is.

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:48.094
Maybe he's in Paris.

01:32:48.095 --> 01:32:49.496
Maybe he's in Hoboken.

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:50.297
Maybe he's president.

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:53.066
Obviously not that.
But I'll never know.

01:32:53.067 --> 01:32:56.536
Because you forgot one important thing
on your way to self-empowerment.

01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:57.515
Me!

01:32:58.139 --> 01:33:00.240
Why didn't you ask his name?

01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:03.279
- Why don't you just shut up.
- No, you shut up!

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:06.313
I got pregnant,
and I had a kid.

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:09.449
Back in college.
And I gave him up for adoption.

01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:12.586
I wasn't in the Netherlands.
I was living above an auto repair shop.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.726
Hiding.
From you.

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:17.190
Because I can't stand you.

01:33:17.191 --> 01:33:19.262
And that's it.
That's all I have to say.

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:22.633
Except,
gel some goddamn dog food.

01:33:27.835 --> 01:33:30.170
Wait,
Portia! Portia!

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:32.772
Portia, don't leave!
Don't leave!

01:33:32.773 --> 01:33:35.219
Portia!
Wait, wait!

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:43.657
I didn't ask the name
of the man on the train because...

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:48.599
...actually,
I didn't have a grand plan.

01:33:48.723 --> 01:33:50.703
I made all that up.

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:53.928
It was all an accident.

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:59.466
A happy accident,
because it led to you.

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.101
Baby, it led to you.

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:04.404
And I wished so many times
that I could have told you his name.

01:34:04.405 --> 01:34:09.514
It's one of the disappointments of my life
and I am so sorry.

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:14.588
Please, come back in.

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:17.588
Mom, I have to go.

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.967
Dad?

01:35:35.696 --> 01:35:36.868
MY car!

01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:39.142
Really?

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:51.144
What happened?
Are you OK?

01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:52.846
It's a slight fracture.

01:35:52.847 --> 01:35:55.623
Fender bender.
It's dumb.

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:01.962
I'm sorry,
I mean, about everything.

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:04.190
I was stupid and selfish.

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:07.229
A selfish asshole.
And I just wanted to come here and...

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:10.642
...tell you that I'm sorry.

01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:17.145
Wait.
How's Nelson?

01:36:18.706 --> 01:36:20.440
Good. He's good.

01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:21.818
How's his Spanish?

01:36:22.243 --> 01:36:23.551
Terrible.

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:26.423
Is he ready for Ecuador?

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.449
We're not going to Ecuador.

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:32.519
- You're not?
- No. I passed on that job.

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.659
Nelson wanted to stay put and...

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:38.030
...you know,
I finally realized that...

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:40.760
...I want him to be happy.

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:43.503
So this decision, right now...

01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:46.011
...I'm going to let him make it.

01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:49.842
Nelson really likes you.

01:36:50.805 --> 01:36:53.039
Nelson likes me
because I'm so boring.

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.141
- You're not boring.
- I'm pretty boring.

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.810
You're not boring.

01:36:56.811 --> 01:36:58.620
I think you're exquisite.

01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:06.729
- You want to go out sometime?
- Yes.

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:10.290
- I mean with me.
- Oh- Yes-.

01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:11.424
Good.

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:13.960
I thought it was important
to acknowledge that it's maybe-

01:37:13.961 --> 01:37:14.828
It's good to clarify.

01:37:14.829 --> 01:37:16.069
I think so.

01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:19.377
NO ADMITTANCE

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:23.239
Portia Nathan?

01:37:25.472 --> 01:37:28.180
So, tell me about yourself-.

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:32.783
I worked in college admissions
for sixteen years.

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:36.316
I used to spend my days
passing judgment...

01:37:36.317 --> 01:37:41.824
...on young people who were
way more together than I was at their age.

01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:45.191
I'm figuring out
what I want to do next.

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:47.894
<i>I've been living at my mom's place
for the last two months.</i>

01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:50.000
<i>I thought
that would drive me insane but...</i>

01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:54.467
...actually, we're going to be throwing a graduation
party for a kid who I thought was my son.

01:37:54.468 --> 01:37:56.106
He's a great kid.

01:37:57.304 --> 01:38:00.751
I killed my bonsai tree
by over trimming it.

01:38:03.644 --> 01:38:08.644
I got pregnant in college and my boyfriend
had already dumped me for someone else.

01:38:08.916 --> 01:38:11.951
I didn't realize
until I was very far along...

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:15.488
...and I didn't think
I could be a mother.

01:38:15.489 --> 01:38:16.356
Ever.

01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:17.223
Portia?

01:38:17.224 --> 01:38:19.932
Did you mean it
when you said I could do this?

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:23.106
Yes.
I meant it.

01:38:23.898 --> 01:38:27.471
- Thanks.
- You're going to do great there.

01:38:27.768 --> 01:38:32.305
My boy, if you are truly outstanding
you'll probably be kicked out of there after one term.

01:38:32.306 --> 01:38:34.173
- Cut it out, Vlad.
- Excuse me.

01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:36.609
Don't listen to him.
Did you decide what your major is?

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:38.283
Philosophy, love.

01:38:39.647 --> 01:38:41.547
Not philosophy,
women's studies.

01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:43.323
You know, that's
enough philosophy.

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:46.719
<i>And if your biological son
chooses to contact you'?</i>

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.453
<i>How would you feel?</i>

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:48.899
<i>I would feel...</i>

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:53.026
<i>...nervous, but...</i>

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:56.496
...lucky.
I would feel lucky.

01:38:56.497 --> 01:39:00.172
I would just be grateful
to get to know him.

01:39:00.534 --> 01:39:04.203
I overwalered it too.
The bonsai.

01:39:04.204 --> 01:39:06.439
I just drowned it.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:07.640
- It's OK.
- OK.

01:39:07.641 --> 01:39:09.621
I can't promise anything...

01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:13.757
.-.but we'll contact you
if there's any news.

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:15.548
OK.

01:39:15.549 --> 01:39:16.449
Hey!

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:19.727
Hey.
It's a thin envelope.

01:39:21.555 --> 01:39:23.330
That doesn't mean anything.

01:39:24.758 --> 01:39:26.328
Open it.

01:39:39.807 --> 01:39:42.788
It says he's not ready
to meet me at this time.

01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:49.818
OK.
Well then...

01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:52.391
You're on the waitlist.

01:39:53.287 --> 01:39:55.421
That's not so bad.

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:58.460
No, it's not.
Right.

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:10.512
Hey Portia.
Everything OK?

01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:12.243
Yes.

01:40:21.648 --> 01:40:23.821
<i>What's the secret
to getting in'?</i>

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:25.863
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.160
<i>You have to find out
for yourself.</i>
