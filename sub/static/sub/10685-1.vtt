01:18.000 --> 01:21.002
"Ludwig van Beethoven,
the man who inherited...

01:21.086 --> 01:25.924
and increased the immortal fame
of Handel and Bach...

01:26.008 --> 01:29.930
of Haydn and Mozart,
is now no more.

01:45.733 --> 01:50.572
He was an artist,
and who will stand beside him?

01:50.615 --> 01:53.367
He was an artist...

01:53.450 --> 01:57.704
and what he was,
he was only through music.

01:58.578 --> 02:02.291
The thorns of life
had wounded him deeply...

02:02.373 --> 02:05.293
so he held fast to his art...

02:05.376 --> 02:09.591
even when the gate through which
it entered was shut.

02:09.673 --> 02:14.262
Music spoke through a deafened ear
to he who could no longer hear it.

02:16.055 --> 02:18.474
He carried the music
in his heart.

03:28.954 --> 03:33.626
Because he shut himself off
from the world, they called him hostile.

03:33.667 --> 03:36.087
They said he was unfeeling...

03:36.171 --> 03:37.421
and called him callous.

03:38.796 --> 03:42.634
But he was not hard of heart.

03:44.343 --> 03:49.056
It is the finest blades
that are most easily blunted...

03:50.141 --> 03:53.061
bent or broken.

04:03.863 --> 04:09.034
He withdrew from his fellow man
after he had given them everything...

04:09.118 --> 04:12.746
and had received nothing in return.

04:12.828 --> 04:14.497
He lived alone...

04:14.539 --> 04:17.665
because he found no second self.

04:17.750 --> 04:21.793
Thus he was, thus he died.

04:21.879 --> 04:24.587
Thus he will live for all time".

05:54.088 --> 05:55.758
Which one of you is the thief?

05:55.841 --> 05:58.092
Huh?

06:00.553 --> 06:03.930
Produce the money,
or I will have you arrested!

06:05.640 --> 06:07.519
Then arrest me!

06:07.602 --> 06:11.896
I took him in when nobody
could bear his company!

06:11.982 --> 06:14.107
And now you want to get paid, eh?

06:15.901 --> 06:18.237
- Bank shares.
- Give them to me!

06:18.319 --> 06:22.198
The money is mine!

06:22.280 --> 06:25.326
Here. Here is his will.

06:26.827 --> 06:30.248
"I declare that my brothers
Caspar and Johann...

06:30.331 --> 06:33.959
are the heirs to my fortune,
if so it can be called".

06:34.001 --> 06:38.589
As Caspar is long dead,
that leaves me! Just me!

06:38.673 --> 06:43.300
Well, give me my money!
Answer!

06:45.011 --> 06:47.597
This is his final testament.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.098
What?

06:51.350 --> 06:55.937
"All my music
and all the capital of my estate..

06:56.021 --> 07:00.652
shall go to my sole heir,
my immortal beloved".

07:00.694 --> 07:03.445
Signed, "Ludwig van Beethoven".

07:03.528 --> 07:05.448
A letter is enclosed.

07:07.532 --> 07:09.284
- This is...
- Come on, now.

07:09.368 --> 07:11.328
Don't keep me in suspense.
Who is it?

07:12.453 --> 07:14.331
- Nobody.
- Oh, not so.

07:14.415 --> 07:15.917
The letter bears no name.

07:16.749 --> 07:18.500
"To my immortal beloved".

07:26.134 --> 07:30.970
"My angel, my all,
my other self".

07:33.223 --> 07:36.978
The maestro was nursing
a secret passion.

07:37.060 --> 07:41.647
I never heard such words from his lips.
Who could this be?

07:41.730 --> 07:44.192
The only love he held
was for himself.

07:44.275 --> 07:48.195
I suffered his insults, his temper.

07:48.279 --> 07:52.031
I suffered in silence when he spat
the food I made back in my face.

07:52.074 --> 07:54.367
That money is ours!

07:54.409 --> 07:55.995
It is not.

07:56.077 --> 08:00.373
It doesn't matter anymore.
He is gone.

08:00.457 --> 08:02.375
We have his music.

08:05.002 --> 08:06.420
Destroy this letter.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.342
It would only show
his disordered life to the world.

08:11.425 --> 08:15.595
It's his dying wish.
We owe him at least that.

08:15.678 --> 08:17.888
You have no authority in this matter.

08:17.974 --> 08:19.974
I have his authority.

08:21.644 --> 08:23.311
Still the faithful dog, eh?

08:24.102 --> 08:25.356
He was my friend.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.564
What friend would be so cruel?

08:27.649 --> 08:30.359
What brother so uncaring?

08:30.445 --> 08:32.903
You know nothing of my brother!

08:52.295 --> 08:55.089
Take me to Karlsbad.

09:03.805 --> 09:08.769
"My angel, my all, my other self.

09:08.811 --> 09:13.065
Just a few words today
and that in pencil, yours.

09:14.482 --> 09:18.280
Only tomorrow will I know for certain
where I am to stay.

09:18.320 --> 09:22.239
A worthless waste of time
and such.

09:22.323 --> 09:24.742
Why this deep sorrow?

09:24.826 --> 09:29.913
If we could be united,
we would feel this pain no longer".

09:36.713 --> 09:39.507
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, Frau...

09:39.589 --> 09:41.050
Streicher.

09:41.134 --> 09:45.094
- Herr Schindler.
- Let me find your reservation.

09:45.176 --> 09:47.472
I'm afraid I don't have
a reservation.

09:47.557 --> 09:52.684
Oh, no matter. We have always room
for a gentleman such as yourself.

09:52.768 --> 09:55.771
Is this the address for this hotel?

09:58.400 --> 10:00.486
One moment.

10:00.568 --> 10:02.611
Ja, of course.

10:02.695 --> 10:05.864
Do you know the name
Ludwig van Beethoven?

10:05.946 --> 10:08.199
- The composer?
- Yes.

10:08.284 --> 10:10.661
I knew him.

10:10.701 --> 10:14.829
- Did he ever stay here?
- Are you a policeman?

10:16.541 --> 10:19.002
Then I will not answer your questions.

10:19.043 --> 10:22.296
Oh, please, I'm trying
to conclude his affairs.

10:22.379 --> 10:24.297
Ah, van Beethoven is dead.

10:25.339 --> 10:26.383
Alas, yes.

10:26.467 --> 10:29.218
Best thing for him.
He was a terrible man.

10:30.013 --> 10:31.513
Then he stayed here?

10:31.554 --> 10:35.266
A long time ago.
Too long to remember.

10:35.349 --> 10:37.394
I can remember only the damage.

10:37.476 --> 10:39.144
The damage?

10:39.187 --> 10:42.565
I was never paid for the damage.

10:42.647 --> 10:45.609
He smashed it all up, everything.

10:45.694 --> 10:50.155
There was a chair, three florins.
Window, five.

10:50.196 --> 10:52.949
- I had to paint everything.
- Frau Streicher.

10:54.034 --> 10:56.995
Would this be sufficient?

11:07.795 --> 11:09.548
There was a woman.

11:11.175 --> 11:16.053
We had been expecting
Herr van Beethoven for days.

11:16.097 --> 11:17.889
She came instead.

11:19.514 --> 11:23.186
She said he was to join her.

11:23.227 --> 11:26.815
She registered in his room.

11:26.896 --> 11:29.483
Under what name?

11:29.568 --> 11:31.820
illegible. Then...

11:33.236 --> 11:37.533
there was this terrible storm,
a deluge.

11:37.616 --> 11:39.451
The woman hid in her room...

11:40.784 --> 11:42.497
waiting.

11:42.579 --> 11:45.832
Ashamed to show her face,
I'd say.

11:47.876 --> 11:51.128
And then, the letter arrived.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.430
You opened the letter.

12:03.515 --> 12:06.852
I had to. How else would I know
who it was for?

12:06.936 --> 12:09.814
I only read his signature.

12:12.355 --> 12:16.778
"My angel, my all, my other self.

12:16.821 --> 12:18.737
Just a few words...

12:18.821 --> 12:22.324
and that in pencil..."

12:22.408 --> 12:25.118
I sent it to her room at once.

12:58.859 --> 13:02.445
She can't have liked what she read.

13:02.528 --> 13:06.656
She left at once, right away.

13:06.742 --> 13:09.244
Left without a word to anybody.

13:11.037 --> 13:15.624
And then, of course,
Herr van Beethoven arrives.

13:15.708 --> 13:19.211
When he found she was gone,
he went mad.

13:19.293 --> 13:21.213
He was like a madman.

13:37.185 --> 13:40.354
Threw a chair out of the window.

13:40.438 --> 13:44.068
I called the police.
I was frightened of him.

13:50.614 --> 13:53.366
Herr van Beethoven!

13:53.450 --> 13:54.869
Open up!

14:29.274 --> 14:31.527
Here is her signature.

14:33.652 --> 14:36.196
Is that a "J" or a "G"?

14:37.534 --> 14:40.115
It looks more like an "A" to me.

14:42.329 --> 14:46.499
She was haughty like a countess.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.125
What did she look like?

14:49.876 --> 14:53.257
Never got a proper look at her.

14:53.339 --> 14:56.509
I don't think she wanted
to be recognized.

15:06.059 --> 15:07.977
Herr Schindler.

15:10.145 --> 15:12.563
Lock the door.

15:12.607 --> 15:13.734
But, Countess...

15:14.318 --> 15:15.985
Lock the door.

15:20.365 --> 15:22.281
We must not be disturbed.

15:23.909 --> 15:26.744
Not everything they say
about me is true.

15:30.750 --> 15:34.879
Holz was here
with the other one, the weasel.

15:34.961 --> 15:36.128
Johann.

15:36.171 --> 15:39.048
How could Luigi
have such a vile brother?

15:39.132 --> 15:41.553
I hope they were in good health.

15:43.009 --> 15:47.139
They say you have
stolen Luigi's money.

15:47.179 --> 15:48.974
They thought you would come here.

15:50.058 --> 15:51.226
Why?

15:51.311 --> 15:53.855
I told them nothing.

15:53.937 --> 15:58.233
The price for my silence
is that you must tell me everything.

15:59.190 --> 16:03.779
I'm afraid that's impossible.
It falls upon me to interrogate you.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.573
Why should I submit to that?

16:08.492 --> 16:10.075
That is what he wanted.

16:10.161 --> 16:11.621
Who?

16:12.579 --> 16:13.998
The maestro.

16:17.918 --> 16:21.462
What I shall tell you
will never leave this room?

16:21.504 --> 16:25.675
On my word of honor, Contessa.

16:29.511 --> 16:32.473
There is substance to the rumors.

16:35.100 --> 16:38.018
I was the great love of Luigi's life.

16:57.371 --> 17:01.208
I first heard the name
Beethoven when I was 17.

17:01.291 --> 17:06.964
I had heard that his music
aroused such passion as to be dangerous.

17:07.046 --> 17:10.883
Some thought it obscene
and unsuitable for the young.

17:35.615 --> 17:39.326
I wrote to my cousins,
Theresa and Josephine.

17:39.410 --> 17:43.705
They lived in Vienna,
the great music capital of the world.

17:45.622 --> 17:50.211
Surely they would know more.
Indeed they did.

17:50.295 --> 17:53.049
They knew him intimately.

17:53.132 --> 17:55.843
More intimately than
they admitted at the time.

18:43.134 --> 18:45.304
Most nights I dreamt of him.

18:45.385 --> 18:48.516
And then,
Father was posted to Vienna.

18:50.977 --> 18:55.440
We were invited to Prince Lichnowsky's
palace for a musical evening.

18:55.522 --> 18:57.274
Beethoven was going to be there.

19:01.361 --> 19:03.029
I knew he must be so noble...

19:03.111 --> 19:06.240
so refined in feeling,
so cultured.

19:06.323 --> 19:10.368
I could hardly wait.
I was going to hear him play.

20:43.914 --> 20:48.752
That music affected me like
none I had ever heard before.

20:48.795 --> 20:51.211
And as for Beethoven...

20:52.255 --> 20:54.215
I was soon overcome.

20:54.256 --> 20:56.219
I feared I might faint.

21:04.182 --> 21:05.435
Hello.

21:06.350 --> 21:09.061
Oh. I didn't see you.

21:10.105 --> 21:12.064
I have to go back.

21:13.274 --> 21:17.029
Oh, you are leaving me
to listen to that ass...

21:17.111 --> 21:21.406
who plays like a kitchen maid,
all clipped and staccato.

21:21.491 --> 21:23.951
This music is beautiful.

21:23.992 --> 21:27.289
I was told that the Viennese
had superior taste.

21:27.329 --> 21:30.708
Clearly in your case,
it is not true.

21:30.792 --> 21:33.834
You must be Julia Guicciardi.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.338
I hear there's quite a contest
for your charms.

21:37.464 --> 21:41.218
Sir, you're rude and offensive.
I'm leaving.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.430
- Do you play the piano?
- What?

21:45.513 --> 21:48.391
I intend to be your teacher.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.935
I shall call for you
tomorrow at 10:00.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.480
You shall be barred from the house.

22:03.154 --> 22:05.657
I could not believe the outrage.

22:05.739 --> 22:10.036
This ugly man, surely a servant,
had called at the front door.

22:16.583 --> 22:19.295
I have an appointment.

22:19.336 --> 22:21.797
She has a piano.

22:25.885 --> 22:27.845
A gentleman is here to see you.

22:27.968 --> 22:30.679
He says he's your new music teacher.

22:30.762 --> 22:33.848
Father, there has been a mistake.
This man is a common oat.

22:33.931 --> 22:38.185
He accosted me last night.
Send him away at once.

22:38.228 --> 22:41.814
I will not! It would be a shame
on our household.

22:44.693 --> 22:47.112
Sir?

22:53.283 --> 22:57.539
May i present Ludwig van Beethoven?

23:21.728 --> 23:24.062
So you must attend my next recital.

23:24.104 --> 23:26.064
I heard you last week.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.066
I remember.

23:28.109 --> 23:30.276
The music was beautiful.

23:30.359 --> 23:32.361
Surely not that bad.

23:32.404 --> 23:34.240
I found the playing exquisite.

23:36.073 --> 23:39.742
It's that damned Beethoven
I can't stand.

23:39.785 --> 23:43.246
People only claim to admire his stuff
so as not to seem ignorant.

23:43.287 --> 23:47.749
My dear husband, don't confirm
your stupidity in front of the guests.

23:52.047 --> 23:54.548
We all speak frankly here.

23:55.633 --> 23:57.092
Tell us your opinion.

23:57.176 --> 23:59.886
Heavens, no.
I was not looking for flattery.

24:02.055 --> 24:04.225
It was too clipped and staccato.

24:04.266 --> 24:07.687
There was not enough singing tone.

24:07.769 --> 24:12.316
Julia, as you can see, is being taught
by the maestro himself.

24:13.525 --> 24:14.442
What?

24:14.526 --> 24:16.571
He comes every day to the house.

24:16.612 --> 24:18.654
Every day?

24:18.736 --> 24:21.117
Is that wise?

24:21.199 --> 24:23.450
Why do you say that?

24:23.536 --> 24:25.619
He's a harsh teacher.

24:26.663 --> 24:29.499
He's a scoundrel
and a republican.

24:29.580 --> 24:31.875
It is even said that he is
a follower of Napoleon.

24:31.959 --> 24:35.086
He'd have us all in the arms
of Madame La Guillotine.

24:35.129 --> 24:39.214
He travels in polite society
on his reputation as a virtuoso...

24:39.298 --> 24:41.424
but flies into a fit if anyone...

24:41.468 --> 24:45.595
even dares suggest
he sit at the keyboard.

24:45.636 --> 24:48.640
Why will he no longer play?

24:48.683 --> 24:52.519
Beethoven is a strange
and obstinate man.

24:52.602 --> 24:54.979
He says it makes him
feel like a servant...

24:55.065 --> 24:57.149
and he serves no masters.

24:57.232 --> 24:59.150
But he takes the money.

25:34.850 --> 25:38.728
You think because I did not stop you
that I am not listening.

25:40.812 --> 25:44.193
A mistake is nothing.

25:45.109 --> 25:47.654
But the fact that
you thump out the notes...

25:47.695 --> 25:52.115
without the least sensitivity
to their meaning is unforgivable.

25:52.198 --> 25:56.493
And your lack of passion
is unforgivable.

25:58.747 --> 26:00.666
I shall have to beat you.

26:26.105 --> 26:28.442
I am writing a new symphony.

26:28.526 --> 26:31.110
It will cause a scandal
because of its subject.

26:31.192 --> 26:33.906
- Tell me.
- Here. Take my arm.

26:40.078 --> 26:42.581
They should make way for us,
not us for them!

26:42.663 --> 26:44.832
Their days are over.
Your world is finished!

26:44.915 --> 26:46.750
Oh, shut up!

26:48.084 --> 26:51.338
When I was a boy, they would have
had you arrested for less.

26:51.421 --> 26:54.756
But now they are scared
of what is happening in France.

26:54.800 --> 26:57.508
- You know why wigs went out of fashion?
- Why?

26:57.595 --> 27:00.180
Because too many ended up
in the bottom of baskets.

27:00.262 --> 27:02.516
But I am a countess, too, Luigi.

27:02.598 --> 27:06.477
They are scared.
Scared of Napoleon.

27:06.562 --> 27:09.480
That is why Napoleon
is the subject of my symphony.

27:49.225 --> 27:53.187
I have here
a proposal of marriage..

27:53.269 --> 27:55.188
from a composer.

27:57.483 --> 28:00.275
- Count Gallenberg.
- Oh.

28:00.318 --> 28:02.195
You were thinking of Beethoven?

28:02.277 --> 28:05.282
Julia, the gossip is everywhere.

28:07.616 --> 28:12.245
- He also has proposed.
- Then there is no contest.

28:12.329 --> 28:14.666
- You love Beethoven?
- Yes.

28:17.500 --> 28:21.380
I cannot give my consent.

28:21.462 --> 28:23.549
We are not wealthy, Julia.

28:23.630 --> 28:27.176
He is a man without rank,
fortune or permanent engagement.

28:27.260 --> 28:30.512
His character and temperament
are so peculiar that I doubt...

28:30.597 --> 28:32.684
any would find happiness with him.

28:32.767 --> 28:34.433
- He's a genius.
- Perhaps.

28:35.518 --> 28:39.981
But in the last year he has not
played nor published a single note.

28:40.021 --> 28:44.857
There are those who say there is
some infirmity that prevents him.

28:44.943 --> 28:48.030
Untrue gossip! Lies!

28:48.113 --> 28:50.114
Has he played for you?

28:53.492 --> 28:56.662
We made a bargain. If I could
prove Luigi could still play...

28:57.705 --> 28:59.625
Father would give his consent.

29:10.050 --> 29:12.508
Obviously a fine countess.

29:14.387 --> 29:15.971
Dear brother...

29:16.057 --> 29:17.890
you are going up in the world.

29:17.974 --> 29:20.601
Hand it over, you ignoramus.

29:20.684 --> 29:24.230
As your secretary,
it is my solemn duty to read this.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.570
"Beloved Luigi, my father
has recently taken delivery...

29:31.653 --> 29:35.405
of a new pianoforte
from Broadwood in London.

29:35.492 --> 29:39.618
It is of the latest design and is
the first of its kind in Vienna.

29:39.703 --> 29:44.831
Tomorrow morning I will send away
the servants and we shall all be out.

29:44.916 --> 29:49.253
I have done this so that you might try
this new invention undisturbed".

33:25.870 --> 33:28.790
What is the meaning of this? What
kind of trick have you played on me?

33:28.872 --> 33:30.624
Stop it, Luigi.

33:30.708 --> 33:33.836
- Herr Beethoven, I beg you.
- Now I see.

33:33.918 --> 33:35.796
- I see perfectly.
- We mean you no harm.

33:35.878 --> 33:39.007
- A little test!
- Luigi, wait!

33:40.092 --> 33:43.928
It is terrible to rob me
in this way...

33:43.970 --> 33:45.931
of my most treasured feelings!

33:48.138 --> 33:50.977
Father can go to hell!
I bid you wait!

33:51.061 --> 33:53.436
It's no use. He can't hear you!

33:53.480 --> 33:55.439
He's deaf!

34:01.654 --> 34:05.741
A month later
I married Count Gallenberg.

34:05.822 --> 34:09.284
And you never heard from him again?

34:09.369 --> 34:10.827
He wrote to me.

34:10.911 --> 34:12.079
It was...

34:13.873 --> 34:16.666
After the war,
there had been some...

34:16.710 --> 34:18.668
unpleasantness.

34:20.087 --> 34:22.130
It was a bad time.

34:31.681 --> 34:33.431
They who think me hostile...

34:34.309 --> 34:37.436
obstinate or misanthropic...

34:37.518 --> 34:40.521
how unjust they are to me...

34:40.606 --> 34:45.067
for they do not know
the secret reason I appear that way.

34:45.152 --> 34:49.529
It is not possible for me
to say, "Speak louder.

34:49.574 --> 34:51.532
Shout. I am deaf".

34:53.327 --> 34:56.954
How can I live if my enemies,
who are many...

34:57.038 --> 35:00.542
believe I no longer possess
the one sense that should be perfect...

35:00.627 --> 35:04.338
to a higher degree in me
than in others?

35:14.097 --> 35:17.889
Not so fast.
So what will you do?

35:17.932 --> 35:21.729
See every shallow countess
Ludwig gave a dedication to?

35:21.810 --> 35:24.521
They are all liars
who want a piece of him now he is gone.

35:24.563 --> 35:27.567
I have the lady's signature.

35:27.650 --> 35:31.194
I shall study his correspondence
to find the hand that matches.

35:31.277 --> 35:33.947
It is illegible.
You are wasting your time.

35:34.031 --> 35:36.992
- No court will uphold this nonsense.
- Help me then.

35:38.199 --> 35:39.702
Are you mad?

35:39.786 --> 35:44.164
Help you to cheat me?
I will tell you this.

35:44.249 --> 35:47.207
There is no lady
at the end of your search.

35:47.251 --> 35:50.504
Ludwig was a woman hater.
Look at how he behaved with Johanna.

35:50.586 --> 35:54.839
He had every right. Your brother
took a bride of low character.

35:54.926 --> 35:58.095
You are too much under Ludwig's
influence to see the truth.

35:59.264 --> 36:01.597
He wanted Caspar under his thumb.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.848
Running his errands.

36:03.933 --> 36:06.393
He hated Johanna
because she took him away.

36:18.780 --> 36:21.410
There she is.

36:22.367 --> 36:24.118
Oh, she's so beautiful.

36:26.577 --> 36:31.291
- A marvelous creature.
- She will be mine.

36:31.334 --> 36:34.127
So, you would betray me for that?

36:34.211 --> 36:36.754
Where is your book? Here.

36:41.133 --> 36:42.470
Willingly.

36:42.551 --> 36:44.095
She can be bought.

36:44.138 --> 36:46.764
- All women can be bought.
- You are insulting the woman I love.

36:49.142 --> 36:51.602
At first, it will
be all enticements.

36:51.688 --> 36:56.148
Then, snap! The trap shuts.
There's always a price to pay.

36:56.189 --> 36:59.276
I would never betray you
for one of those creatures.

37:10.452 --> 37:12.539
Brothers, I have wonderful news.

37:13.955 --> 37:16.042
She has finally consented.

37:16.125 --> 37:18.543
- You are to be wed?
- Yes!

37:18.627 --> 37:19.796
You explain to him.

37:19.836 --> 37:22.506
May I...

37:22.589 --> 37:25.092
present my bride?

37:25.175 --> 37:28.012
Is this a joke?

37:28.845 --> 37:30.805
You cannot be serious.

37:32.348 --> 37:35.101
By all means, copulate with her.

37:35.182 --> 37:38.895
But marriage? What for?

37:38.980 --> 37:40.606
You will be a laughingstock.

37:40.689 --> 37:43.650
Every farmhand in the region
has enjoyed her for free.

37:43.734 --> 37:46.110
Why should you pay more?

37:55.495 --> 37:58.664
I know you cannot hear me,
and I don't care.

37:58.705 --> 38:02.626
What I have to say
is for Caspar, not you.

38:04.878 --> 38:07.507
I have had lovers...

38:07.549 --> 38:09.509
but that is not a crime.

38:14.556 --> 38:16.680
I told you it was impossible.

38:27.900 --> 38:31.654
I only want what is right.

38:33.238 --> 38:37.659
He was jealous of his brother.

38:37.743 --> 38:39.868
Why, she will destroy him.

38:39.953 --> 38:42.663
Jealous of his happiness.

39:00.971 --> 39:05.060
I'm Ludwig van Beethoven,
and I need your help.

39:23.409 --> 39:25.328
Break the door down.

40:04.614 --> 40:05.864
What are you playing at?

40:05.949 --> 40:07.619
Arrest that whore.

40:08.744 --> 40:11.163
- Don't touch her!
- Arrest that whore.

40:11.246 --> 40:13.581
That is slander.

40:14.957 --> 40:16.752
We were married yesterday.

40:25.299 --> 40:26.843
She is with child.

40:29.179 --> 40:30.514
Now leave!

40:31.889 --> 40:35.311
He behaved no better
when I married Therese.

40:35.351 --> 40:38.352
He wanted us both
at his beck and call.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.856
Give up the search.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.857
I cannot.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.859
I have my reasons.

40:44.941 --> 40:47.405
I will find this lady.

40:47.487 --> 40:51.908
And she will claim her legacy
with the full force of the law.

41:03.377 --> 41:05.295
"The journey was dreadful.

41:05.380 --> 41:09.008
The coach had to go and break
down on such a terrible road.

41:09.049 --> 41:12.219
And for no reason,
just a country road.

41:13.969 --> 41:16.683
I have to see you.

41:16.721 --> 41:21.269
However much you love me,
I love you more.

41:21.354 --> 41:23.478
Never hide yourself from me".

41:35.949 --> 41:39.035
Excuse me. I'm looking for
the Countess Erdödy.

41:39.078 --> 41:40.537
Erdödy?

41:45.291 --> 41:47.249
I'm looking for the Countess Erdödy.

41:51.297 --> 41:52.256
Zoltan!

42:04.684 --> 42:07.769
Schindler.
You do not recognize me?

42:07.852 --> 42:09.063
Oh.

42:09.772 --> 42:12.232
Please, sit.
Join me for dinner.

42:18.071 --> 42:20.616
- Countess.
- Anna Marie.

42:20.698 --> 42:23.703
These are my people I'm home now.
I don't have to play the countess.

42:23.786 --> 42:25.204
I'm free!

42:31.624 --> 42:35.461
Poor Louis.
I miss him so much.

42:36.631 --> 42:38.590
His death has left a void.

42:38.674 --> 42:40.885
The way they treated him...

42:42.552 --> 42:44.765
disgusted me.

42:45.805 --> 42:48.017
He was too good for them.

42:48.099 --> 42:49.766
His fire...

42:50.852 --> 42:52.560
offended their small brains.

42:53.396 --> 42:55.649
But not you.

42:56.856 --> 42:59.151
I could match his temperament.

43:01.488 --> 43:03.490
You gave him rooms at your palace?

43:04.948 --> 43:07.660
I wanted him near me.

43:08.536 --> 43:10.077
Was he your lover?

44:26.232 --> 44:27.650
Horns!

44:31.861 --> 44:33.321
Clarinets!

45:21.408 --> 45:23.327
From the beginning.

45:55.147 --> 45:56.480
From the beginning.

46:46.359 --> 46:49.240
That was how I met Louis...

46:51.324 --> 46:54.369
and how the world
learned of his deafness.

46:59.708 --> 47:02.210
I was separated from my husband.

47:02.292 --> 47:07.424
I lived an independent life in Vienna
with my three children.

47:23.896 --> 47:26.356
I will arrange a housekeeper.

47:44.166 --> 47:45.584
Please.

47:55.092 --> 47:57.052
Oh, I had one.

47:59.346 --> 48:01.265
She cheated me.

48:10.940 --> 48:14.361
We had thought of Napoleon
as a liberator...

48:14.443 --> 48:17.156
a force for change.

48:17.237 --> 48:20.034
Now we saw the truth.

48:20.116 --> 48:23.536
Bonaparte
had declared himself emperor...

48:23.619 --> 48:26.413
and set out to conquer the world.

48:26.454 --> 48:30.584
He said he brought freedom
from the tyranny of kings.

48:30.626 --> 48:35.255
But he was Saturn,
gobbling up his children.

48:51.686 --> 48:54.189
His cannon fired night and day...

48:54.272 --> 48:56.191
on the city of Vienna.

49:35.100 --> 49:38.521
Leave her alone!

49:57.122 --> 49:58.082
Mimi!

50:21.727 --> 50:23.147
Fire!

51:02.432 --> 51:04.392
Madam.

51:04.434 --> 51:07.271
There is a gentleman
here to see you.

51:10.440 --> 51:14.236
I cannot receive anybody.

51:14.277 --> 51:16.487
I think he is deaf.

51:16.569 --> 51:18.864
He will not go away.

51:22.159 --> 51:24.120
The countess will see you now.

51:38.506 --> 51:40.259
Your son...

51:51.393 --> 51:53.938
We will speak in music.

52:15.416 --> 52:18.420
Napoleon was victorious.

52:18.502 --> 52:22.049
The whole of Europe was at his feet.

52:22.131 --> 52:26.593
He took a Hapsburg princess
as his bride...

52:26.676 --> 52:29.429
and set up court at Schoenbrun Palace.

52:31.098 --> 52:36.561
He proved himself no different
than any aristocrat.

52:36.643 --> 52:38.562
Everybody was betrayed.

52:40.814 --> 52:43.318
This was the way
of the modern world.

53:55.426 --> 53:58.179
The year Louis lived with us...

53:58.262 --> 54:01.890
was the happiest of my life.

54:01.974 --> 54:03.933
And, I think, of his too.

54:27.246 --> 54:30.250
He opened his heart to me.

54:30.334 --> 54:33.379
He called me
his father confessor.

54:33.461 --> 54:35.380
He told me everything.

54:38.591 --> 54:42.553
You must have loved him
very, very much.

54:42.635 --> 54:44.682
With all my heart.

54:44.763 --> 54:46.516
And he you.

54:58.401 --> 54:59.986
I don't think so. No.

55:00.068 --> 55:02.613
Then he was a fool!

55:05.408 --> 55:06.992
I like you better drunk.

55:08.453 --> 55:10.496
- It's good to talk about him.
- Yeah.

55:11.997 --> 55:14.958
But is this why
you came all this way?

55:14.999 --> 55:17.834
No, not only.

55:17.878 --> 55:20.504
You said there was
some unfinished business.

55:20.587 --> 55:22.005
There is.

55:23.174 --> 55:25.885
But how can I help you, Anton?

55:29.387 --> 55:31.931
Perhaps it's nothing.

55:32.017 --> 55:36.436
And perhaps it's the key to him.

55:38.939 --> 55:43.151
Perhaps they're right
and I should let it go, but I cannot.

55:43.193 --> 55:46.905
- It's impossible for me.
- But why?

55:49.283 --> 55:52.450
It was that damned sonata...

55:54.037 --> 55:55.620
the "Kreutzer".

55:57.039 --> 56:00.501
At the time I entertained
ambitions of a musical career.

56:00.541 --> 56:03.337
I'd gone to Vienna to study
and was fortunate enough...

56:03.379 --> 56:05.880
to be taken by Schuppanzigh
as a pupil.

56:05.921 --> 56:09.135
He and George Bridgetower,
the famous virtuoso from Africa...

56:09.216 --> 56:12.178
were about to premiere
this new Beethoven sonata...

56:12.260 --> 56:15.098
at Count Razumovsky's that evening...

56:15.182 --> 56:18.100
and I was allowed
to attend the rehearsal.

56:19.559 --> 56:24.107
It was there that the seed
of a mystery was planted...

56:24.189 --> 56:27.066
that haunts me to this day.

56:37.076 --> 56:38.411
Do you like it?

56:39.495 --> 56:42.415
I cannot hear them.

56:42.456 --> 56:44.750
But I know they are
making a hash of it.

56:44.832 --> 56:46.753
What do you think?

56:50.212 --> 56:54.299
Music is a dreadful thing.

56:55.759 --> 56:57.888
What is it?

56:57.970 --> 56:59.473
I don't understand it.

56:59.555 --> 57:02.850
What does it do?

57:04.476 --> 57:07.646
It exalts the soul.

57:07.730 --> 57:10.733
Utter nonsense If you hear
a marching band, is your soul exalted?

57:10.774 --> 57:14.028
No, you march.
If you hear a waltz, you dance.

57:14.111 --> 57:16.238
If you hear a mass,
you take communion.

57:17.405 --> 57:20.783
It is the power of music...

57:20.824 --> 57:24.412
to carry one directly
into the mental state...

57:24.494 --> 57:26.288
of the composer.

57:26.998 --> 57:29.710
The listener has no choice.

57:29.792 --> 57:31.708
It is like hypnotism.

57:33.503 --> 57:36.256
So, now...

57:36.296 --> 57:38.923
what was in my mind
when I wrote this?

57:43.470 --> 57:47.850
A man is trying
to reach his lover.

57:47.933 --> 57:50.560
His carriage has broken down
in the rain.

57:50.644 --> 57:53.482
The wheels stuck in the mud.

57:55.065 --> 57:56.983
She will only wait so long.

57:59.277 --> 58:01.779
This...

58:01.863 --> 58:05.033
is the sound of his agitation.

58:13.539 --> 58:16.335
"This is how it is..."

58:17.252 --> 58:19.837
the music is saying.

58:21.464 --> 58:24.091
"Not how you are used to being.

58:24.176 --> 58:27.136
Not how you are used to thinking.

58:28.679 --> 58:30.641
But like this".

58:33.353 --> 58:37.188
Who was the woman?
He never told me.

58:37.273 --> 58:39.356
I knew better than to ask.

58:42.651 --> 58:46.072
He made me see the world
in an entirely new light.

58:47.904 --> 58:52.827
I abandoned my petty ambitions.
I fetched and carried for him.

58:52.870 --> 58:56.373
I wrote his letters and smoothed over
his domestic disputes.

58:58.248 --> 59:00.625
I became his secretary.

59:05.879 --> 59:10.551
Oh, the hag has sold it in the market
for a souvenir.

59:10.633 --> 59:12.345
Oh, no.

59:12.427 --> 59:14.514
It's lost.

59:15.557 --> 59:17.684
Gone forever.

59:17.766 --> 59:19.226
Here.

59:24.065 --> 59:25.525
Maybe not.

59:27.191 --> 59:30.278
Ludwig was convinced he had left
the sketch for his new symphony...

59:30.361 --> 59:32.905
in the safekeeping
of his brother Caspar.

59:32.990 --> 59:35.034
- My God. Here.
- Uncle!

59:35.115 --> 59:37.618
The brothers had barely spoken
for eight years.

59:37.700 --> 59:39.286
This is Herr Schindler.

59:39.369 --> 59:42.374
This is my brother Caspar...

59:43.249 --> 59:47.126
and my nephew, young Karl.

59:47.211 --> 59:50.379
Had I realized this,
I would have stopped him.

59:52.757 --> 59:54.718
It is good to see you.

01:00:04.265 --> 01:00:07.771
I need the papers
I entrusted to you.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:19.573
They were all returned to you.

01:00:35.588 --> 01:00:39.842
I said, your papers
are not here.

01:00:51.479 --> 01:00:54.063
You.
Where are my notes?

01:00:54.148 --> 01:00:57.108
I would rather he not cause a scene
in front of the boy.

01:00:57.191 --> 01:01:00.194
- What did the whore say?
- Get out of my house!

01:01:00.278 --> 01:01:02.530
You've thrown away my music.

01:01:02.615 --> 01:01:06.117
You and this foul slut
you call a wife.

01:01:16.836 --> 01:01:18.753
- You have betrayed me!
- Maestro!

01:01:18.839 --> 01:01:20.588
Maestro, please!

01:01:20.673 --> 01:01:22.007
Stop it!

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:25.009
He's sick!

01:01:29.345 --> 01:01:32.391
Leave!
Never return to this house!

01:01:34.184 --> 01:01:36.145
He has consumption.

01:01:53.953 --> 01:01:56.621
Caspar died
before the year was out...

01:01:56.706 --> 01:01:59.499
but there was no relief
in his death.

01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:02.126
Rather, it sent Ludwig
on a path of action...

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:04.129
that would lead to his destruction.

01:02:05.213 --> 01:02:07.255
That man.

01:02:07.341 --> 01:02:09.508
He rooms with her.

01:02:10.303 --> 01:02:14.223
My brother's bed is not yet cold...

01:02:15.055 --> 01:02:17.017
and he is climbing in.

01:02:27.358 --> 01:02:31.613
If he says nasty things about me,
don't listen. None of it is true.

01:02:31.697 --> 01:02:34.366
- Promise?
- I promise.

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:37.452
I will come and see you
every day.

01:02:38.244 --> 01:02:39.663
Come in.

01:02:42.247 --> 01:02:43.666
Is this the lad?

01:02:47.545 --> 01:02:48.962
Yes.

01:02:50.924 --> 01:02:52.840
"By order of the Landrechte...

01:02:52.924 --> 01:02:57.638
Ludwig van Beethoven has been appointed
the legal guardian of his nephew Karl...

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:02.808
owing to the low moral character
of his mother, Johanna van Beethoven.

01:03:02.892 --> 01:03:06.311
Rights of visitation for the mother will
be at the discretion and convenience...

01:03:06.396 --> 01:03:08.313
of the legal guardian".

01:03:47.892 --> 01:03:49.435
Too watery.

01:03:52.147 --> 01:03:53.563
Write.

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:10.914
Then we shall have to find
someone who can cook.

01:04:15.834 --> 01:04:18.463
She has a swinish face anyway.

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:25.510
- Were you taught music?
- Yes.

01:04:27.762 --> 01:04:29.680
I have a gift for you.

01:04:37.187 --> 01:04:38.606
Come.

01:04:47.531 --> 01:04:49.948
- Can you read?
- Yes.

01:05:13.011 --> 01:05:15.098
Here.

01:05:15.181 --> 01:05:17.101
Let me show you.

01:05:30.528 --> 01:05:32.448
You shall be a musician.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:35.866
I want to be a soldier.

01:05:35.908 --> 01:05:37.534
A composer?

01:05:37.578 --> 01:05:39.537
No. A soldier.

01:05:41.373 --> 01:05:42.790
Oh.

01:05:47.294 --> 01:05:50.255
I gave my first concert
when I was your age.

01:05:52.174 --> 01:05:53.718
I was terrible.

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:59.598
Your grandfather thought that he was
going to make a fortune out of me...

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.599
as a child prodigy.

01:06:02.933 --> 01:06:04.852
Like Mozart's old man.

01:06:12.192 --> 01:06:14.403
But I was pigheaded.

01:06:14.488 --> 01:06:19.741
I wouldn't play that tinkly,
pretty stuff that was in vogue then.

01:06:19.824 --> 01:06:22.410
But the keyboards of the day
were not up to it.

01:06:22.493 --> 01:06:25.996
The first time I played at court,
I broke four strings.

01:06:26.079 --> 01:06:27.999
Herr Beethoven!

01:06:29.124 --> 01:06:31.543
The boy is hardly a Mozart,
is he?

01:06:34.378 --> 01:06:36.298
I was 12...

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:38.799
but Father told them I was nine.

01:07:30.849 --> 01:07:33.685
Mother died of consumption...

01:07:33.726 --> 01:07:36.980
and I became
the head of the family.

01:07:41.442 --> 01:07:42.735
Your papa...

01:07:43.986 --> 01:07:45.904
I loved most of all.

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:50.785
As I love you...

01:07:51.866 --> 01:07:53.620
my dear Karl.

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.893
His eyes shone with joy...

01:08:19.975 --> 01:08:22.229
when he looked at the boy.

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:25.817
All the love in his rich and deep nature
seemed to concentrate...

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:28.236
on this boy.

01:08:28.318 --> 01:08:31.446
There was no more tender father.

01:08:45.084 --> 01:08:47.001
You should hear him play.

01:08:48.587 --> 01:08:50.921
He is going to be a great virtuoso.

01:08:57.344 --> 01:08:58.763
You spoil him.

01:09:05.435 --> 01:09:08.064
Schindler tells me
you've written nothing.

01:09:08.106 --> 01:09:10.064
Well, I have no time.

01:09:11.608 --> 01:09:13.359
And besides...

01:09:14.196 --> 01:09:17.490
all the servants that Schindler sends me
are scoundrels.

01:09:17.573 --> 01:09:18.991
You are impossible.

01:09:20.867 --> 01:09:22.911
Perhaps.

01:09:24.412 --> 01:09:25.912
You and I...

01:09:29.206 --> 01:09:30.794
Could Karl...

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:35.881
not replace
the son that you lost?

01:09:53.354 --> 01:09:56.317
I know what it is to lose a son.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:09.077
I know the sorrow Johanna feels.

01:10:10.287 --> 01:10:13.709
- She has no right to him!
- She's his mother!

01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:16.836
She's his mother!

01:10:22.173 --> 01:10:24.219
What new insanity is this?

01:10:24.301 --> 01:10:27.931
It has come to our attention
that you have been bribing servants...

01:10:28.013 --> 01:10:30.807
in order to have access to the boy
in secret...

01:10:30.848 --> 01:10:33.685
while you well know that Herr Beethoven
would not allow...

01:10:33.727 --> 01:10:36.060
You are talking about my son.

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:41.067
My son, who I have not seen for a year,
who is being taught to hate me.

01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:43.236
The decree of the court states...

01:10:43.319 --> 01:10:45.320
I know what it says.

01:10:47.865 --> 01:10:52.702
Can you look me in the eye and tell me
a mother has no right to see her son?

01:10:55.455 --> 01:10:57.248
I will fight this.

01:10:57.332 --> 01:10:59.500
You will lose.

01:10:59.542 --> 01:11:01.500
He has many enemies.

01:11:04.045 --> 01:11:06.675
The filth was bad enough.

01:11:06.757 --> 01:11:08.715
That man is mad.

01:11:08.759 --> 01:11:12.885
He cannot hear a thing.
He's always shouting and yelling.

01:11:12.971 --> 01:11:16.516
The landlord would chuck him out
from his carrying on.

01:11:16.599 --> 01:11:20.603
The boy is just as bad.
His uncle encouraged him.

01:11:20.685 --> 01:11:25.024
I overheard them discussing how
they was going to beat me, so I left.

01:11:25.065 --> 01:11:27.569
Was the boy kept clean?

01:11:27.652 --> 01:11:31.697
He'd go a month
without fresh underwear.

01:11:31.737 --> 01:11:35.326
That man cannot look after himself,
let alone a child.

01:11:35.408 --> 01:11:38.579
I would now like to call
Karl van Beethoven.

01:11:52.258 --> 01:11:54.216
Good afternoon, Karl.

01:11:54.261 --> 01:11:55.636
Good afternoon.

01:11:55.718 --> 01:11:57.637
How does your uncle treat you?

01:11:58.346 --> 01:11:59.431
Well.

01:11:59.513 --> 01:12:01.515
He has a hot temper?

01:12:01.599 --> 01:12:02.683
Yes.

01:12:02.769 --> 01:12:05.268
- Do you fear his temper?
- No.

01:12:06.185 --> 01:12:09.983
- Did he ever punish you?
- Only when I deserved it.

01:12:11.066 --> 01:12:13.610
Who would you prefer to live with?

01:12:14.445 --> 01:12:17.198
Your uncle or your mother?

01:12:18.281 --> 01:12:20.534
Do you want to stay
with your uncle?

01:12:21.618 --> 01:12:22.743
Yes.

01:12:22.785 --> 01:12:24.120
Speak up.

01:12:24.204 --> 01:12:27.206
- Yes.
- You don't sound certain.

01:12:27.291 --> 01:12:31.212
It would be better
if Uncle had someone to be with him...

01:12:31.293 --> 01:12:35.297
because he is hard of hearing
and can't talk to me.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.299
In fact, he is stone deaf.

01:12:43.473 --> 01:12:45.182
Do you love your mother?

01:12:50.353 --> 01:12:52.438
Yes.

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.356
Do you miss her?

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.109
Yes.

01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:59.570
Then would you not prefer
to live with her?

01:13:05.284 --> 01:13:07.202
Uncle needs me.

01:13:11.165 --> 01:13:15.793
What I would prefer...

01:13:15.835 --> 01:13:19.172
is that we might all live together.

01:13:21.256 --> 01:13:23.176
This way, gentlemen, please.

01:13:29.722 --> 01:13:33.809
Herr Beethoven,
our most accomplished composer.

01:13:35.019 --> 01:13:37.104
It is an honor.

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:42.319
Chancellor Metternich...

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.904
due to his infirmity, Herr Beethoven
has requested that I speak for him.

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:48.364
As you wish.

01:13:48.449 --> 01:13:51.369
His case in the magistracies
is not going well.

01:13:51.451 --> 01:13:54.871
That is, Frau Beethoven
has bribed witnesses...

01:13:54.954 --> 01:13:57.291
Sir, I need your help.

01:13:57.373 --> 01:14:00.586
My young nephew, Karl...

01:14:00.668 --> 01:14:04.547
he is being corrupted
by this woman's poisonous carryings on.

01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:09.342
- What Herr Beethoven means...
- Why should I help you, Beethoven?

01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:34.783
"Metternich is a worse tyrant
than Napoleon".

01:14:34.866 --> 01:14:38.578
That was recorded last Tuesday
at the Swan Tavern.

01:14:41.664 --> 01:14:45.126
"Metternich should be forced
to eat my shit".

01:14:46.378 --> 01:14:48.964
And so on, and so forth.

01:14:50.045 --> 01:14:53.176
Herr Beethoven,
there are many forces in Austria...

01:14:53.258 --> 01:14:55.302
that foment revolt.

01:14:55.386 --> 01:14:58.304
I like a lively discussion
as much as the next man...

01:14:58.388 --> 01:15:02.434
but I fear that these days
we cannot allow quite so much...

01:15:02.516 --> 01:15:04.768
How can I put it?

01:15:04.852 --> 01:15:06.314
Enthusiasm.

01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:10.192
Perhaps it would be better
if our great artists...

01:15:10.274 --> 01:15:12.193
were a little more circumspect.

01:15:12.276 --> 01:15:15.029
Herr Beethoven proposes
that he write a grand oratorio...

01:15:15.113 --> 01:15:18.449
praising Austria
and your magnificent diplomacy...

01:15:18.532 --> 01:15:20.575
at the Congress of Vienna...

01:15:20.617 --> 01:15:23.578
that has secured the peace
for all of Europe.

01:15:27.414 --> 01:15:29.542
This court...

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:33.838
has seen fit to ordain...

01:15:33.922 --> 01:15:38.009
that Johanna van Beethoven...

01:15:38.091 --> 01:15:41.345
shall be excluded from...

01:15:42.513 --> 01:15:44.973
This court is corrupt!

01:15:52.647 --> 01:15:56.400
Now that the boy was delivered
to Ludwig, body and soul...

01:15:56.484 --> 01:16:01.990
the deaf genius began in earnest what
was to be his most tragic endeavor...

01:16:02.072 --> 01:16:04.992
to make his ward a great virtuoso.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.748
For five long years
this was his goal...

01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:12.834
and in those five years
Ludwig wrote nothing.

01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:14.835
Not the oratorio
he promised Metternich.

01:16:14.919 --> 01:16:17.837
Not the mass he promised
the London Philharmonic Society.

01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:20.840
Not the great symphony
he spoke of endlessly.

01:16:22.091 --> 01:16:23.509
Nothing.

01:16:27.553 --> 01:16:31.057
In Vienna they thought he was finished...
deaf, written-out.

01:16:32.143 --> 01:16:34.061
Rossini had performed
The Thieving Magpie..

01:16:34.143 --> 01:16:36.814
and Italian opera was all the rage.

01:16:36.852 --> 01:16:39.815
Beethoven was no longer performed.

01:16:45.444 --> 01:16:46.863
Karl!

01:17:07.633 --> 01:17:08.718
It's late.

01:17:10.221 --> 01:17:11.470
I'm sorry, sir.

01:17:19.808 --> 01:17:21.938
It's disgusting.

01:17:22.022 --> 01:17:26.566
Why does she disobey me? She knows
my bowel is in a terrible state.

01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:37.244
You're trying to poison me!

01:17:48.002 --> 01:17:52.758
Well, she might appear
plump and pretty to you...

01:17:52.841 --> 01:17:55.386
but she's a vulgar bitch.

01:17:55.469 --> 01:17:59.472
Gossips about me all over town.

01:18:02.558 --> 01:18:03.851
Fräulein!

01:18:06.105 --> 01:18:07.440
Yes, sir?

01:18:07.523 --> 01:18:10.192
Your food is poison.
You're fired.

01:18:17.449 --> 01:18:19.199
You foul old bastard.

01:18:19.283 --> 01:18:21.201
Write.

01:18:26.706 --> 01:18:28.293
Where are you going?

01:18:29.918 --> 01:18:31.419
Away from you.

01:18:34.629 --> 01:18:36.591
Well, leave me, then.

01:18:37.967 --> 01:18:39.886
You're evil.

01:18:39.969 --> 01:18:41.886
Like your mother.

01:18:43.764 --> 01:18:47.059
Leave me alone with no food.

01:19:06.159 --> 01:19:08.077
Have you seen Karl?

01:20:08.675 --> 01:20:10.595
You're worthless!

01:20:11.889 --> 01:20:13.512
Worthless!

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.508
I'm sending for the doctor now.

01:20:56.053 --> 01:20:57.471
Tomorrow.

01:21:02.558 --> 01:21:04.143
Play for me.

01:21:05.437 --> 01:21:06.854
Not now.

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:09.941
It will calm me.

01:21:11.609 --> 01:21:13.068
Play.

01:22:27.346 --> 01:22:29.765
I found this the other day.

01:22:30.850 --> 01:22:32.767
"The Maestro,
Ludwig van Beethoven...

01:22:32.853 --> 01:22:34.769
has the pleasure
to announce a concert...

01:22:34.853 --> 01:22:39.691
which will be the debut of his nephew
and ward, Karl van Beethoven...

01:22:39.775 --> 01:22:42.192
a prodigy instructed
by the Maestro himself".

01:22:42.276 --> 01:22:46.490
Why, this is wonderful. The very thing
that will raise his spirits.

01:22:46.531 --> 01:22:48.532
You must be very excited.

01:22:48.615 --> 01:22:50.825
Anton, have you ever heard me play?

01:22:50.868 --> 01:22:53.621
- No, but...
- You have to help me.

01:22:53.705 --> 01:22:56.122
I'm at the end of my tether.

01:22:58.750 --> 01:23:01.337
Endless hours at the keyboard.

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:05.381
For what?

01:23:05.466 --> 01:23:08.383
He cannot hear
my ham-fisted playing.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.391
He does no work.

01:23:17.725 --> 01:23:21.355
All he does is
scribble incomprehensible phrases.

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:27.986
Then he bellows this stupid,
childish tune at the top of his lungs.

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:38.828
He says this is the motif
of a grand symphony.

01:23:40.661 --> 01:23:42.249
I think it's ridiculous.

01:23:43.666 --> 01:23:46.586
- That cannot be.
- But it is.

01:23:47.921 --> 01:23:50.339
I think he's going mad.

01:23:54.386 --> 01:23:56.388
So...

01:23:57.595 --> 01:24:00.516
I am to abandon my plans, eh?

01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:03.767
I am placing...

01:24:03.852 --> 01:24:06.771
intolerable pressure..

01:24:06.813 --> 01:24:08.814
on Karl, eh?

01:24:12.902 --> 01:24:14.529
He is a...

01:24:15.528 --> 01:24:17.450
a mediocre talent.

01:24:26.122 --> 01:24:30.251
There are always these...

01:24:30.335 --> 01:24:33.004
asinine fellows like Schindler...

01:24:33.088 --> 01:24:35.132
with their...

01:24:35.215 --> 01:24:37.633
commonplace opinions...

01:24:37.718 --> 01:24:40.218
from their commonplace minds.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.138
Schindler is right.

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:44.640
Oh.

01:24:46.641 --> 01:24:48.603
Anton Schindler...

01:24:48.644 --> 01:24:50.102
bad violinist...

01:24:50.144 --> 01:24:53.648
knows more about music
than Ludwig van Beethoven.

01:24:54.648 --> 01:24:56.567
This is too much.

01:24:58.653 --> 01:25:00.279
You're torturing the boy.

01:25:10.621 --> 01:25:14.042
I always thought
that you were a bore...

01:25:15.628 --> 01:25:17.878
and an ass...

01:25:17.962 --> 01:25:21.507
but you've had your uses,
and now you have none.

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:22.718
Get out.

01:25:31.726 --> 01:25:35.230
Get out.

01:26:36.076 --> 01:26:38.370
Wake up, bastard!

01:26:38.411 --> 01:26:39.872
Schindler!

01:26:41.625 --> 01:26:43.248
Wake up!

01:26:44.334 --> 01:26:45.753
Karl.

01:26:46.796 --> 01:26:48.253
He's gone...

01:26:49.298 --> 01:26:50.507
on your account.

01:28:44.904 --> 01:28:47.073
My Karl has shot himself.

01:28:47.157 --> 01:28:50.951
A farmer found him in the ruins.
He carried him here on his cart.

01:28:51.035 --> 01:28:52.453
I fear the worst.

01:28:54.205 --> 01:28:55.622
Uncle.

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:58.417
I was expecting you.

01:29:46.587 --> 01:29:49.841
Karl was a bungler with firearms.

01:29:49.922 --> 01:29:53.050
The bullet
did not penetrate his skull.

01:29:53.135 --> 01:29:55.762
He did not die.

01:29:55.844 --> 01:29:59.431
But the legend grew in Vienna
of Ludwig's cruelty to the boy...

01:30:00.684 --> 01:30:03.437
of how he drove him to a desperate act.

01:30:04.685 --> 01:30:08.023
Those who had
silently disliked him...

01:30:08.107 --> 01:30:10.024
now shouted their derision...

01:30:11.109 --> 01:30:13.026
from the rooftops.

01:30:53.647 --> 01:30:55.192
There is a letter.

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:02.405
I must find this lady.

01:31:04.074 --> 01:31:07.495
He bequeathed
his entire estate to her.

01:31:21.549 --> 01:31:23.802
It was not written to me.

01:31:27.136 --> 01:31:28.808
Then who?

01:31:36.521 --> 01:31:39.608
It was she who came between us.

01:31:41.484 --> 01:31:43.487
I loved him completely...

01:31:43.527 --> 01:31:47.115
but he could never
return that sentiment.

01:31:47.199 --> 01:31:49.116
He could not forget her.

01:31:50.244 --> 01:31:51.496
Who is she?

01:31:56.873 --> 01:31:58.626
I failed him.

01:31:58.710 --> 01:32:01.129
We all failed him.

01:32:01.211 --> 01:32:03.172
He gave us so much.

01:32:03.213 --> 01:32:06.174
We couldn't even
make his life tolerable.

01:32:06.215 --> 01:32:08.842
This last wish
must be as he wanted.

01:32:08.885 --> 01:32:11.262
Tell me.

01:32:11.346 --> 01:32:13.347
Tell me her name.

01:32:16.434 --> 01:32:19.104
The answer was always
in front of you.

01:32:26.359 --> 01:32:28.321
"While still in my bed...

01:32:28.405 --> 01:32:30.530
my thoughts turn to you...

01:32:30.612 --> 01:32:32.574
my immortal beloved.

01:32:32.615 --> 01:32:33.866
What will you do?

01:32:33.907 --> 01:32:35.703
Some happy, some sad...

01:32:35.785 --> 01:32:37.744
I don't know.

01:32:37.829 --> 01:32:41.499
waiting to see
whether fate will hear us.

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:44.251
I don't know.

01:32:50.215 --> 01:32:54.968
I can live only completely
with you or not at all.

01:32:55.052 --> 01:32:57.555
Yes. It must be".

01:32:58.763 --> 01:33:00.184
Go to her.

01:33:01.933 --> 01:33:03.352
It must be.

01:33:42.722 --> 01:33:44.641
May we speak in private?

01:33:45.974 --> 01:33:49.021
I have nothing to hide
from my workers.

01:33:49.812 --> 01:33:51.397
I implore you.

01:33:56.652 --> 01:33:59.113
As you can see,
I am very busy.

01:34:03.157 --> 01:34:05.117
Frau Beethoven...

01:34:06.534 --> 01:34:09.663
may I see a sample
of your handwriting?

01:34:10.747 --> 01:34:12.832
- Why?
- Please.

01:34:14.376 --> 01:34:15.836
Indulge me.

01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:25.845
Here.

01:34:35.062 --> 01:34:37.149
Is this your handwriting?

01:34:38.108 --> 01:34:39.232
What is this?

01:34:40.025 --> 01:34:43.903
A page from the registry
of a hotel in Karlsbad.

01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:47.073
I would like you to go.

01:34:47.158 --> 01:34:48.573
Signed...

01:34:51.077 --> 01:34:52.329
by you.

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:56.875
Did you ever meet Ludwig
in Karlsbad?

01:34:58.709 --> 01:35:02.419
You can hardly be unaware of the manner
in which I suffered at his hands.

01:35:02.504 --> 01:35:05.422
I find the question
as insulting as it is impudent.

01:35:05.507 --> 01:35:07.092
What are you implying?

01:35:07.175 --> 01:35:10.845
There can be no peace
without the truth.

01:35:14.850 --> 01:35:16.767
For you, maybe.

01:35:17.892 --> 01:35:20.353
But I have made my peace
with Ludwig.

01:35:41.914 --> 01:35:44.875
I forgave him
because of the "Ode to Joy".

01:35:47.754 --> 01:35:50.714
When they announced the premiere
of the Ninth Symphony...

01:35:50.758 --> 01:35:52.925
the gossip was everywhere.

01:35:53.010 --> 01:35:55.176
Ludwig had fought with the singers.

01:35:55.261 --> 01:35:57.178
He had fought the theater.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:04.854
Even though
I had hated him for so long...

01:36:04.936 --> 01:36:08.022
even though
he had tried to destroy me...

01:36:08.105 --> 01:36:10.486
I went.

01:36:10.569 --> 01:36:11.987
I had to go.

01:36:13.068 --> 01:36:15.488
I knew it would be the last time.

01:37:08.454 --> 01:37:10.246
I could not see him...

01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:13.167
and I imagined
some last-minute insult...

01:37:13.250 --> 01:37:15.168
had sent him running home.

01:37:34.186 --> 01:37:35.857
Then I saw him.

01:37:35.938 --> 01:37:37.857
Everybody saw him.

01:43:02.866 --> 01:43:04.533
Bravo!

01:43:39.983 --> 01:43:44.071
He had revealed
his most hidden secrets to us.

01:43:44.155 --> 01:43:46.531
The circle was broken.

01:43:46.615 --> 01:43:50.035
I could not hate the man
who could write such music.

01:43:52.702 --> 01:43:54.621
I saw him one more time...

01:43:54.705 --> 01:43:57.833
at his rooms
on Schwarzspanier Strasse.

01:43:57.915 --> 01:43:59.877
That was where he died.

01:44:01.587 --> 01:44:03.548
His belly swelled so much...

01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:06.969
that the surgeon had to make a puncture
to drain off the fluid.

01:44:08.095 --> 01:44:10.679
The incision became inflamed.

01:44:10.721 --> 01:44:14.849
His strength has gone,
and I fear the death struggle has begun.

01:44:16.392 --> 01:44:20.353
I want him to receive the last rites
while he is still conscious.

01:44:20.395 --> 01:44:24.232
But when I suggested
I send for a priest...

01:44:24.316 --> 01:44:27.527
he turned his face to the wall
and called me an ass.

01:44:27.609 --> 01:44:30.864
Then he asked for you.
I don't know why.

01:44:30.949 --> 01:44:32.490
Is he sleeping?

01:44:32.574 --> 01:44:34.157
I don't think so.

01:44:36.202 --> 01:44:37.786
He is composing.

01:47:48.046 --> 01:47:50.383
The comedy is over.

01:48:24.914 --> 01:48:26.332
Yes.

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:30.127
I once loved him.

01:48:35.466 --> 01:48:37.969
But he turned his back on me.

01:48:38.054 --> 01:48:39.970
He abandoned me.

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:43.265
I never heard a word from him.

01:48:45.684 --> 01:48:48.269
I was a fool.

01:48:48.353 --> 01:48:50.689
I never meant anything to him.

01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:53.609
But the letter...

01:48:54.609 --> 01:48:55.735
What letter?

01:49:18.465 --> 01:49:20.465
Frau Beethoven, I believe...

01:49:21.716 --> 01:49:23.678
this is addressed to you.

01:50:45.919 --> 01:50:48.171
"My angel...

01:50:48.255 --> 01:50:50.632
my all...

01:50:50.716 --> 01:50:53.303
my other self.

01:50:53.386 --> 01:50:57.389
Just a few words today,
and that in pencil...

01:50:57.471 --> 01:50:58.932
yours.

01:51:05.856 --> 01:51:09.776
Only tomorrow will I know for certain
where I am to stay.

01:51:09.858 --> 01:51:13.570
A worthless waste
of time and such.

01:51:13.654 --> 01:51:16.407
Why this deep sorrow?

01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:20.953
If we could be united,
we would feel this pain no longer.

01:51:22.203 --> 01:51:23.915
Where I am...

01:51:23.997 --> 01:51:26.374
you are with me too.

01:51:26.459 --> 01:51:30.838
Soon we shall live together,
and what a life it will be".

01:51:54.317 --> 01:51:56.236
- We must talk.
- Not here.

01:51:59.906 --> 01:52:02.158
Caspar will come.

01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:03.659
We must speak.

01:52:06.036 --> 01:52:07.995
I'm talking too loudly.

01:52:12.836 --> 01:52:15.628
Meet me in Karlsbad.

01:52:15.710 --> 01:52:17.921
This is the address.

01:52:18.005 --> 01:52:21.674
I can no longer skulk around
like a guilty schoolboy.

01:52:33.978 --> 01:52:36.440
I have your child in me.

01:52:40.985 --> 01:52:42.403
Go.

01:53:05.634 --> 01:53:07.843
"The journey was dreadful.

01:53:07.885 --> 01:53:11.638
I did not arrive here
until 4:00 in the morning.

01:53:11.722 --> 01:53:14.642
At the last stop they warned me
against traveling at night...

01:53:14.725 --> 01:53:17.351
and tried to frighten me
about a forest...

01:53:17.393 --> 01:53:20.563
but that only tempted me.

01:53:20.646 --> 01:53:25.027
The coach had to go and break down
on such a terrible road for no reason.

01:53:25.067 --> 01:53:26.737
Just a country road...

01:53:26.819 --> 01:53:30.448
and now I am held up completely.

01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:32.783
But I have found another...

01:53:32.868 --> 01:53:36.328
and we will surely
see one another soon.

01:53:36.412 --> 01:53:38.329
Today, I hope.

01:53:40.624 --> 01:53:43.501
I have to see you.

01:53:43.585 --> 01:53:45.503
However much you love me...

01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:49.213
I love you more.

01:53:49.299 --> 01:53:51.758
Never hide yourself from me".

01:55:08.415 --> 01:55:10.500
Herr van Beethoven!

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.459
Wait!

01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:49.618
"While still in my bed...

01:55:49.702 --> 01:55:52.827
my thoughts turn to you...

01:55:52.872 --> 01:55:54.831
my immortal beloved.

01:55:55.707 --> 01:55:58.877
Some of them happy, some sad...

01:56:00.042 --> 01:56:03.005
waiting to see
whether fate will hear us.

01:56:06.049 --> 01:56:10.846
I can live only completely
with you or not at all.

01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:13.390
Yes. It must be.

01:56:15.850 --> 01:56:18.187
I must go to sleep now.

01:56:18.228 --> 01:56:20.772
Be calm, love.

01:56:20.856 --> 01:56:23.440
Today, yesterday...

01:56:23.524 --> 01:56:25.736
what longing with tears for you.

01:56:26.819 --> 01:56:29.032
You.

01:56:29.072 --> 01:56:31.616
You're my life.

01:56:31.698 --> 01:56:33.619
My everything.

01:56:35.119 --> 01:56:36.787
Farewell, then.

01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:38.373
Go on loving me.

01:56:38.456 --> 01:56:41.916
Ever yours, ever mine...

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.002
forever".
