WEBVTT

00:15.958 --> 00:18.583
The turning has started early.

00:19.541 --> 00:22.333
Another must join our ranks.

00:23.291 --> 00:26.541
The dark initiation is nigh.

00:33.958 --> 00:36.875
-Sweet baby Jesus.

00:37.375 --> 00:39.291
The corn made a picture!

00:40.000 --> 00:42.625
The time has come.

00:42.708 --> 00:46.583
The time has come.
The time has come.

00:46.666 --> 00:50.875
The time has come. The time has come.

00:50.958 --> 00:52.791
The time has come.

00:53.666 --> 00:55.375
The time has come…

00:55.458 --> 00:58.875
-…for year-end bonus o'clock!

00:58.958 --> 01:00.541
-Great news, guys.

01:00.625 --> 01:03.208
I know I can be
a real cabal-buster sometimes.

01:03.291 --> 01:04.458
But the numbers are in,

01:04.541 --> 01:08.291
and we have finished
this year's missions in record time.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.833
So these gifts are from J.R.
to express his thanks.

01:11.916 --> 01:14.791
Ooh, what's it gonna be?
A private island?

01:14.875 --> 01:16.416
Please be the nuclear codes.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.333
-Tote bags? Again? Son of a bitch!

01:19.416 --> 01:22.125
I don't need a bag to carry shit.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.416
-I got six fucking arms.
-Uh-uh.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.833
Wait. There could be
a check inside of it or…

01:26.916 --> 01:28.375
…a commemorative tinfoil hat.

01:28.458 --> 01:29.875
That's just actual garbage.

01:29.958 --> 01:31.083
-Oh man.
-Oh my God.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.833
-I want gifts.
-Guys. Hey, guys.

01:32.916 --> 01:34.208
You know what? You're right.

01:34.291 --> 01:38.125
You do deserve more than tote bags.
I'm taking this to J.R.

01:38.208 --> 01:40.458
-Give it to him!
-Yeah, girl!

01:41.041 --> 01:45.000
J.R., my team has worked harder than ever
to deliver on our missions, and--

01:45.083 --> 01:47.583
And it has finally paid off!

01:47.666 --> 01:51.458
After a lifetime of kissing every ass
up the ass ladder,

01:51.541 --> 01:53.875
I have finally become top ass!

01:53.958 --> 01:56.500
The Robes are initiating me
into the Shadow Board!

01:56.583 --> 01:59.500
-Wow, very Hogwarts.

01:59.583 --> 02:01.625
And there's blood on my hands.

02:01.708 --> 02:03.333
Join the club.

02:03.416 --> 02:06.000
All my life,
I've had a humble dream

02:06.083 --> 02:09.666
to be the most rich
and powerful person in the universe.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.166
And now it's happening,

02:11.250 --> 02:13.791
and I want you to be the next CEO.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.208
Oh my God.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.791
-I'm gonna run Cognito?

02:17.875 --> 02:21.416
I thought this day would never come!
I'm so unprepared.

02:21.500 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, are you gripping a binder
called Reagan's Inevitable Takeover?

02:25.083 --> 02:26.041
Wow.

02:26.125 --> 02:29.250
This is so much to take in.
I feel like celebrating.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.708
Ooh, you wanna disappear someone
for funsies?

02:31.791 --> 02:36.000
It's hilarious. They get sent
to Shadow prison and erased from history.

02:36.083 --> 02:39.500
I should probably wait at least a week
before going mad with power.

02:39.583 --> 02:43.041
Ah, you remind me
of when I had more hair and values.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.666
-You want my advice?

02:44.750 --> 02:47.041
-You gotta be ruthless to run this place.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.750
Once you're actually sitting
in this chair, everything changes.

02:50.833 --> 02:53.708
With all due respect, sir,
that's what I'm counting on.

02:53.791 --> 02:56.083
-Hell yeah, Mole-Man!

02:56.166 --> 02:57.708
What up, 3Pac?

02:57.791 --> 03:00.083
Stem Cell Steve, have you gotten younger?

03:00.166 --> 03:01.250
That's what I do.

03:02.458 --> 03:03.500
What up, Deep State?

03:03.583 --> 03:05.708
Today I control you!

03:08.750 --> 03:10.333
Well, this will go well.

03:34.583 --> 03:38.125
Dad, I've got some good news
and some good booze.

03:38.208 --> 03:41.833
-Ah! Intruder!
-Ow! Ooh, Rea-- Kiddo! Kiddo, it's me!

03:41.916 --> 03:43.250
Whoa. Sorry, Dad.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.500
I wanted to surprise you
for your promotion

03:45.583 --> 03:46.958
by cleaning up the place.

03:51.083 --> 03:53.291
I almost got my vomit stains
out of your diploma.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.916
Wow, that's weirdly thoughtful of you.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.791
Hey, Dad, can I run a work problem by you?

03:58.875 --> 04:01.750
Are you kidding?
I was a work problem for years. Shoot.

04:01.833 --> 04:07.291
Do you think, in order to be a CEO,
I have to be a ruthless psycho like J.R.?

04:07.375 --> 04:08.958
Fuck J.R., Reagan.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.958
You've been preparing for this job
since you were six years old.

04:12.041 --> 04:14.125
I'm proud of myself for raising you.

04:14.208 --> 04:17.958
So by the transitive process,
you're saying you're proud of me.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.125
Eh, something like that.

04:20.208 --> 04:22.541
Aw, Dad. Distant hug.

04:22.625 --> 04:23.458
Ah.

04:23.541 --> 04:24.875
-Yeah, how's that?
-It's something.

04:24.958 --> 04:25.791
It's tolerable.

04:25.875 --> 04:31.291
Today, I finally leave Cognito Inc.
and ascend to the Shadow Board.

04:31.375 --> 04:33.666
I want you to know I love you all

04:33.750 --> 04:35.875
like a random group of people

04:35.958 --> 04:39.208
I was contractually required
to spend 40 hours a week with.

04:39.291 --> 04:43.541
To quote Christian Bale's meltdown
on the set of Terminator Salvation,

04:43.625 --> 04:45.375
"We are done professionally."

04:45.458 --> 04:47.333
Thank you, and enjoy the shrimp.

04:53.875 --> 04:56.666
Today, a new dawn is dawning.

04:56.750 --> 04:57.833
Look, let's get real.

04:57.916 --> 05:00.833
This company has been
an old boys' club for years.

05:00.916 --> 05:02.541
I mean, really old.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.000
-You take that back.

05:04.083 --> 05:07.666
For far too long, this company
has run on lies, selfishness,

05:07.750 --> 05:10.291
and a lust for money
that borders on the sexual.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.291
Hell yeah!

05:11.375 --> 05:12.708
Well, no more.

05:12.791 --> 05:16.000
-I present Cognito 2.0.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.750
We're gonna make the world a better place,

05:17.833 --> 05:20.166
starting with chairs
with improved neck support

05:20.250 --> 05:22.208
for our Easter Island population…

05:22.291 --> 05:24.791
-Oh, very ergonomic.

05:24.875 --> 05:28.666
…to increased media spending
for the subliminal messages that matter.

05:29.666 --> 05:32.875
Recycle.
Health care is a right. Delete Twitter.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.750
I even created an ethics bot

05:34.833 --> 05:37.958
to ensure that our missions
are morally acceptable.

05:38.041 --> 05:42.375
Congratulations, Cognito Inc.
You are 51% not evil.

05:42.958 --> 05:44.291
-Booyah!

05:44.375 --> 05:47.083
But best of all, no more shitty tote bags.

05:47.166 --> 05:50.291
Task force, you're getting crew jackets.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.708
Ah! It's me. I'm on a jacket.

05:53.791 --> 05:56.791
I'm so excited I can't breathe.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.291
Huh, jackets?

05:58.375 --> 06:01.541
Unlike these chumps,
my loyalty isn't for sale.

06:01.625 --> 06:04.333
Oh, I also upgraded
Myc's weird jerk-off machine

06:04.416 --> 06:06.750
so we can milk all six tentacles at once.

06:06.833 --> 06:09.000
Slay me, mushroom daddy.

06:09.083 --> 06:11.583
I would both kill and die for you.

06:11.666 --> 06:13.333
Reagan, 2024.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.041
Reagan! Reagan!

06:15.125 --> 06:18.250
Hell yeah! My best friend is my boss.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.291
This is gonna be so uncomplicated.

06:22.083 --> 06:23.000
Whoo!

06:25.000 --> 06:28.958
Finally, it's gonna be
a Deep State you can trust.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.750
Trust no one.
There's been a security breach!

06:35.000 --> 06:38.166
Shit! Crapping-ass! Damn it!
Pants full of fucking shit!

06:38.250 --> 06:39.541
There's a mole in our midst.

06:39.625 --> 06:43.041
They've broken in
and stolen the unspoken file.

06:44.583 --> 06:46.166
What's the unspoken file?

06:46.250 --> 06:49.041
The one we don't speak about.
You got a brain under that hot face?

06:49.125 --> 06:50.583
It's the master dossier

06:50.666 --> 06:53.166
of every conspiracy
we have ever committed.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.708
If that gets exposed,
the whole company goes down.

06:55.791 --> 07:00.000
Someone here is trying to personally
fuck me over, and I won't have it.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.833
If the Robes find out about this,
the only place I'll be promoted to

07:02.916 --> 07:04.666
is Shadow prison X.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.791
The place we disappear people to

07:06.875 --> 07:09.791
that's so secret
even we don't know where it is?

07:09.875 --> 07:11.875
That's where we sent
the third Olsen triplet.

07:11.958 --> 07:14.875
Pour one out for Stacey May Olsen.

07:14.958 --> 07:18.166
Okay, let's just all stay calm
and be reasonable about this.

07:18.250 --> 07:22.375
I'm filling the atrium
with sharks trained in Krav Maga!

07:30.333 --> 07:34.166
I'm going to my coronation ceremony
come hell or shark water.

07:34.250 --> 07:37.125
Reagan, you wanted to be boss.
Here's your first task.

07:37.208 --> 07:40.000
Find the mole by end of day,

07:40.083 --> 07:42.791
or I'm disappearing every one of you!

07:47.041 --> 07:49.541
Oh, and Reagan, congrats on the promotion.

07:50.625 --> 07:51.458
Thank you.

07:51.541 --> 07:54.416
I hope you survive yours as well.

07:56.666 --> 07:58.375
Hey, Cognito.

07:58.458 --> 08:01.083
It's your new CEO here,
thanking you for your cooperation

08:01.166 --> 08:03.791
with this whole friendly,
mandatory screening.

08:03.875 --> 08:06.708
Warrantless searches
are unethical.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.416
-Okay, Reagan, no pressure.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.583
You have ten hours to find the mole,
or everyone dies.

08:11.666 --> 08:14.666
This job is my dream.
I will not give up on my utopia.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.750
I can't go to Shadow prison X.

08:16.833 --> 08:18.666
I created all their torture devices

08:18.750 --> 08:22.000
with the express understanding
I'd never have to experience them.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.625
Okay, whoever did this
wanted to take down J.R.

08:24.708 --> 08:26.708
and didn't care about the fallout.
But why?

08:26.791 --> 08:29.750
Who in this company
would be such an asshole?

08:31.250 --> 08:32.750
Oh, come on.

08:32.833 --> 08:35.666
No, there's
only one truly vengeful traitor

08:35.750 --> 08:36.583
in the building,

08:36.666 --> 08:39.083
and I know because it's basically
all he talks about.

08:39.166 --> 08:41.791
It is not. Besides, I can't be your mole.

08:41.875 --> 08:45.208
I've been trapped in a glass tomb
for a reason we've all forgotten.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.791
Attempted global genocide?

08:46.875 --> 08:50.500
Do us all a favor,
build a bridge and get over it.

08:50.583 --> 08:51.625
Am I right, folks?

08:51.708 --> 08:55.291
This guy is a pistol.
Why don't we hang out more, man?

08:55.375 --> 08:56.750
His casing is intact.

08:56.833 --> 08:58.583
There's no way
he could've stolen the file.

08:58.666 --> 09:00.833
Ah, but I saw on the security log

09:00.916 --> 09:05.458
that J.R.'s door was opened at midnight
by someone with department-head clearance.

09:05.541 --> 09:08.250
Wait, but wouldn't that mean
that the mole would have to be…

09:08.333 --> 09:10.791
Someone in this room.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.791
Drama.

09:15.041 --> 09:18.041
It's fine, J.R.,
the Robes don't know about the leak.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.958
Don't lose it.
Just schmooze it.

09:21.041 --> 09:22.708
-Oh, hello!

09:22.791 --> 09:24.875
How's my favorite Shadow Council doing?

09:24.958 --> 09:29.166
You cryptic bastards
still keeping it shady, or what?

09:29.250 --> 09:30.958
Hello, J.R.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.250
We've been watching you.

09:33.333 --> 09:36.083
So is this
where we're doing my, uh, robe ceremony?

09:36.166 --> 09:39.666
We didn't bring you here
to give you a robe, J.R.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.791
Ah, okay, you caught me.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.833
Look, I can explain!

09:44.833 --> 09:47.208
We brought you
to compete to the death for one.

09:47.291 --> 09:50.333
So this isn't Shadow prison?

09:50.416 --> 09:52.791
No, it's an insidious maze

09:52.875 --> 09:56.916
filled with deadly traps
and sinister creations.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Wow.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.583
What a diabolical twist.

09:59.666 --> 10:00.791
You guys are good!

10:00.875 --> 10:02.375
I love the decor, by the way.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.458
May the first person
to exit the maze win.

10:05.541 --> 10:07.708
Let the games begin.

10:07.791 --> 10:10.958
Okay, crusty old guy, crusty old guy…

10:11.041 --> 10:15.375
J.R. Scheimpough,
the most entitled person I know,

10:15.458 --> 10:18.166
and I've had Tom Cruise
jump on my furniture.

10:18.250 --> 10:22.375
Well, well, well. Oprah. Hey, how are
things over at the Illuminati, by the way?

10:22.458 --> 10:25.708
You still tryin' to scramble up
to the top of that greasy pyramid?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.750
You're not
the only rich sociopath

10:27.833 --> 10:30.083
I'm going to leapfrog
on my way to the top.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.000
Ah!

10:31.083 --> 10:33.625
I knew God didn't exist. Ow!

10:33.708 --> 10:35.500
It's too many snakes.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.166
Booby-trap floor. That's cute.

10:38.250 --> 10:42.458
You seem calm for a man
who's one puzzle away from certain peril.

10:42.541 --> 10:46.250
A maze is just a building full of lies
designed to make everyone miserable.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.625
I've been running one of those
for 40 years.

10:53.416 --> 10:56.041
Okay, we're still a team,
except for the one of us that's not.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.583
Can't Myc just tell us who did it?

10:57.666 --> 10:59.833
My, uh, psychic powers
are tapped out.

10:59.916 --> 11:03.541
I might have gone a little overboard
test-driving Reagan's new spank tank.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.625
That sounds like
something a leaker would say.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.708
Look, he's leaking right now.

11:07.791 --> 11:09.500
You're quick to point a flipper.

11:09.583 --> 11:12.875
I say Glenn's the mole.
His backstory doesn't make any sense.

11:12.958 --> 11:14.875
He's a human who became a dolphin,

11:14.958 --> 11:17.625
but his last name
has always been Dolphman?

11:17.708 --> 11:19.666
-I'm calling bullshit.
-I have an idea.

11:19.750 --> 11:22.375
Maybe we can share the blame equally,

11:22.458 --> 11:23.458
like best bros.

11:23.541 --> 11:25.750
You'd love that. Maybe Brett's the mole,

11:25.833 --> 11:29.000
and he did this to force all of us
to be best buddies in prison forever!

11:29.083 --> 11:30.250
Everybody calm down.

11:30.333 --> 11:34.458
Don't forget, this is Cognito 2.0.
I'm gonna solve this humanely.

11:34.541 --> 11:35.875
None of us have left the building,

11:35.958 --> 11:37.791
so the unspoken file
hasn't left the building.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.833
We'll search office by office.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.875
We find the file, we find the mole.

11:41.958 --> 11:44.708
-It's every Mothman for himself!

11:44.791 --> 11:46.833
That's right, I'm taking all the lamps!

11:46.916 --> 11:48.708
Social order is breaking down!

11:49.958 --> 11:51.833
Well, Brett's creepily clean.

11:51.916 --> 11:54.583
Is that an entire drawer of Purell?

11:54.666 --> 11:56.750
Mm-hmm. That's some American Psycho shit.

11:56.833 --> 11:59.458
I'm a blank slate,
and I have nothing to hide.

11:59.541 --> 12:01.916
-Concealed item detected.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.416
Ooh.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.291
-He's got a wire.
-Oh, my God.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.791
My hunch about you from day one was right.

12:07.875 --> 12:11.833
You're some kind of sleeper agent
created in a lab by Abercrombie.

12:11.916 --> 12:14.666
-Quick, test his reflexes.
-Ow! Ah!

12:14.750 --> 12:16.250
Guys, okay, I can explain.

12:16.333 --> 12:18.166
-This is my audio journal.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.708
Dear diary,
how are you? I'm Brett.

12:20.791 --> 12:24.416
Sometimes I wonder,
do trees have feelings?

12:24.500 --> 12:26.125
My therapist recommended that I keep one

12:26.208 --> 12:29.333
because I feel
emotionally gaslit by you guys, a lot.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.666
Scan complete. Area cleared.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.333
Look, search all you want.

12:33.416 --> 12:36.833
The only thing you'll find looking through
my personal possessions is jealousy.

12:36.916 --> 12:40.416
Jealousy and dozens
of rejected job applications

12:40.500 --> 12:42.000
to work for the Illuminati?

12:43.041 --> 12:44.625
Maybe you sold out J.R.

12:44.708 --> 12:48.583
in exchange for a cushy new gig
with Oprah at our rival company.

12:48.666 --> 12:50.291
You're leaving us, Gigi?

12:50.375 --> 12:53.208
Dear diary, abandonment issues
rearing their ugly head again.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.000
That's none of your goddamn business.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.250
If I wanted J.R. canceled,
I'd have done it with a tweet.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.250
I got cancel tweets
locked and loaded for all y'all,

13:00.333 --> 13:02.333
so watch your ass.

13:03.041 --> 13:06.041
Did someone already ransack
Andre's office?

13:06.125 --> 13:07.125
What? No.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.666
This is how I keep my office.

13:10.583 --> 13:14.000
Or did you destroy your lab
in a fit of rage

13:14.083 --> 13:18.166
after J.R. refused
to let the FDA approve your truth serum?

13:18.250 --> 13:21.875
Look, I'm hooked on truth serum, okay?
Regular drugs don't work anymore.

13:21.958 --> 13:24.625
The only thing
that gives me a rush are harsh truths.

13:24.708 --> 13:25.791
Harsh truths?

13:25.875 --> 13:28.541
If you survive 40,
I hope you find peace with yourself.

13:28.625 --> 13:30.416
Yes! Harsher.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.291
Oh God, he's enjoying this.

13:32.875 --> 13:36.166
I'm no traitor. You can cavity-search me
if you want. Go ahead.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.916
What's inside the vault?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.375
Hmm. Nothing.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.083
-No, no, no, no!

13:44.916 --> 13:46.166
What the hell?

13:46.250 --> 13:48.166
A wig? Fidget spinners?

13:48.250 --> 13:49.541
A secret identity!

13:49.625 --> 13:52.125
You're a double agent with double chins!

13:52.208 --> 13:53.333
I am not!

13:53.416 --> 13:56.791
The truth is,
I've been working undercover at Georgetown

13:56.875 --> 14:00.625
under the alias of 19-year-old
liberal arts major Chad Dallas.

14:00.708 --> 14:04.458
Only thing Chad loves more
than vaping on his electronic cigarettes

14:04.541 --> 14:07.583
is signing up his fellow teens
to become drone pilots

14:07.666 --> 14:09.000
for the US military.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.541
Thanks, bros.

14:10.625 --> 14:14.083
Sacrificing yourself to the state is bae.

14:14.916 --> 14:18.000
-Area cleared.
-Booyah! Exonerated.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.625
Well, I guess that's everyone.

14:19.708 --> 14:20.958
It's Myc then.

14:21.041 --> 14:22.500
Myc's the goddamn mole.

14:22.583 --> 14:24.583
-Ah! It's not me.
-Unethical.

14:24.666 --> 14:26.375
-Unethical.
-Whoa, Reagan. A little timeout.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.125
-Ah!

14:28.208 --> 14:31.833
You are acting
cheugy right now, Reagan.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.625
Things are, uh, getting
a little heated in there, Ray-dawg.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.500
How does running
this company ethically help

14:40.583 --> 14:42.791
if I can't even find one lousy mole?

14:42.875 --> 14:44.875
Maybe the mole isn't one of our friends.

14:44.958 --> 14:47.375
I guess I'm just
an atrium half full kind of guy,

14:47.458 --> 14:48.958
but I think they're telling the truth.

14:49.791 --> 14:53.416
That's it, Brett, truth.
I know how we're gonna find the mole.

14:53.500 --> 14:57.166
We're gonna slip those shady bastards
a little of Andre's truth serum.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.250
Whoa, Reagan,
doesn't that seem a little--

14:59.333 --> 15:01.833
Unethical. Unethical.
Uneth--

15:01.916 --> 15:04.666
In a perfect world,
we wouldn't have to drug our friends

15:04.750 --> 15:06.333
to avoid being eaten by sharks.

15:06.416 --> 15:08.916
But we live in America in the 2020s,

15:09.000 --> 15:10.375
and all bets are off.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.583
It's time for you
to stop thinking with your heart

15:12.666 --> 15:14.291
and start thinking with your head.

15:14.375 --> 15:15.250
But…

15:15.333 --> 15:16.416
For the gang.

15:19.333 --> 15:23.041
Okay, let's drug our friends
to save our friends.

15:25.666 --> 15:29.125
Let's see, we've got a pharaoh, Aristotle…

15:29.208 --> 15:31.208
Ronald McDonald? Was he a real guy?

15:31.291 --> 15:33.958
-Can a god become a man?

15:34.041 --> 15:37.750
Look, let's skip the banter
till after I'm a Robe and you're dead.

15:37.833 --> 15:41.083
No, you simple sentient forehead.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.583
You're going to get me that robe.

15:43.666 --> 15:45.500
And why would I do that?

15:45.583 --> 15:48.875
'Cause Cognito has a mole.

15:48.958 --> 15:52.208
And unless you want the Robes to know
you can't keep your house clean,

15:52.291 --> 15:55.666
you're going to do
exactly what Oprah tells you.

15:55.750 --> 15:56.875
Goddamn it.

15:56.958 --> 15:59.708
Fine. But only because
you gave me a car that one time.

16:00.291 --> 16:03.416
Out of curiosity, how the hell
did you find out about the leak?

16:03.500 --> 16:05.916
Let's just say your extraction team

16:06.000 --> 16:08.500
was looking
for new employment opportunities.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.666
Is this about me
using them as a death squad?

16:13.083 --> 16:15.541
Goddamn millennials
just won't put the work in.

16:17.625 --> 16:18.708
Sorry, guys.

16:18.791 --> 16:21.166
I said things would be different
with me as CEO.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.708
If we go down, we go down together.

16:23.791 --> 16:27.875
A toast to the best group
of coconspirators anyone could ask for.

16:32.041 --> 16:35.541
Huh. I have a weird urge to tell someone
whatever the opposite of a lie is.

16:35.625 --> 16:36.833
Wh… what is that called again?

16:36.916 --> 16:40.458
That's because I put
Andre's truth serum in your drinks.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.833
-You truth-roofied us?

16:42.916 --> 16:45.250
I prefer tru-fied. It's more playful.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.000
Now you're all gonna talk.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.375
-Gigi, are you the mole?
-No!

16:49.458 --> 16:52.500
Then why were you applying
to join the Illuminati?

16:52.583 --> 16:55.583
Because they're the Prada
of secret societies,

16:55.666 --> 16:57.208
and you all ignore me.

16:57.291 --> 17:00.333
I don't think any of you
even know what my damn last name is.

17:00.416 --> 17:02.208
I wanna say Luigi?

17:02.291 --> 17:03.666
Gigi Luigi?

17:03.750 --> 17:06.958
I'm gonna kick whatever you have
instead of an ass.

17:07.041 --> 17:09.208
This is good.
We're talking, letting out our truths.

17:09.291 --> 17:10.208
Myc, are you the mole?

17:10.291 --> 17:12.083
Hell no.
But we're telling the truth?

17:12.166 --> 17:14.541
Well, I got some truth bombs for you.

17:14.625 --> 17:17.000
I've been in your minds all year.

17:17.083 --> 17:19.666
I know all your dirty little secrets.

17:19.750 --> 17:22.458
Gigi hooked up with Andre
at the company Christmas party.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.875
Brett thinks Reagan's mom is hot.

17:24.958 --> 17:26.833
Reagan has a Carl Sagan fetish,

17:26.916 --> 17:29.708
and Glenn has had sex dreams
about all of us.

17:29.791 --> 17:30.791
-Oh my gosh!
-Jesus Christ.

17:30.875 --> 17:31.750
No, no, no, no.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.625
Damn you, mushroom!

17:33.708 --> 17:37.791
This is why I've been secretly trying
to get your fungal ass deported

17:37.875 --> 17:39.333
back to the center of the Earth.

17:39.416 --> 17:42.041
-You've been trying to deport Myc?

17:42.125 --> 17:45.041
Dolphin versus mushroom.
This is like watching Planet Earth.

17:45.125 --> 17:46.958
Shut your bong hole, Tommy Chong.

17:47.041 --> 17:50.666
Everyone here just uses you to get drugs,
and you're definitely the mole.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.416
I… I'm not the mole.
I'm not even a real doctor.

17:54.916 --> 17:56.875
I flunked out of med school my first year.

17:56.958 --> 18:00.291
My PhD is photoshopped
from an episode of Doc McStuffins.

18:00.375 --> 18:03.375
Andre, you did my dolphin surgery.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.750
You literally said the words,

18:05.833 --> 18:07.666
"Trust me, I'm a doctor."

18:07.750 --> 18:09.416
That's just a turn of phrase.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.458
"I'm a doctor." "Where's the beef?"

18:11.541 --> 18:14.750
"Gigi, I wasn't kind of frightened
by our sexual encounter."

18:17.666 --> 18:18.625
Hey!

18:18.708 --> 18:19.708
You know what?

18:19.791 --> 18:23.958
If J.R. wants to kill me,
tell him to go ahead and try it.

18:24.041 --> 18:25.666
Hidden weapons!

18:29.666 --> 18:32.458
Stop! Stop!
Reagan, the truth is tearing us apart.

18:32.541 --> 18:33.708
It doesn't make any sense.

18:33.791 --> 18:38.208
It's not like some other perfect suspect
is gonna just, like, fall out of the sky.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.333
-What?

18:40.833 --> 18:43.916
Congrats
on the promotion, sweetie.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.541
-What the entire fuck are you doing here?

18:47.625 --> 18:49.333
Look, I know what this looks like.

18:49.416 --> 18:51.375
I'm a former disgruntled employee

18:51.458 --> 18:54.958
mysteriously sneaking
into a company I swore "vengeance" on.

18:55.041 --> 18:57.000
However, you know, fucking--

18:57.833 --> 18:59.833
Man, this one really got away from me.

19:02.250 --> 19:05.083
It all makes sense! Rand hates J.R.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.750
Conclusions jumped. Hand over the file.

19:07.833 --> 19:10.541
Dad, I want the truth, and if you lie,

19:10.625 --> 19:15.041
I swear I will have Bear-o
smother you physically and emotionally.

19:15.125 --> 19:17.416
Truth is, I just snuck in this morning

19:17.500 --> 19:19.833
to bring you a little surprise
on your big day.

19:19.916 --> 19:21.708
Well, it used to be cupcakes,

19:21.791 --> 19:24.583
but I got lost in the vents
and started boredom eating

19:24.666 --> 19:27.375
listening to you assholes
Agatha Christie each other.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.250
But you're banned from the company.
How do you have clearance?

19:30.333 --> 19:32.250
-I borrowed Reagan's.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.125
He's got the motive.
He's got department-head clearance.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.083
Feed him to the sharks.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:38.291 --> 19:41.208
Let's not make
any rash decisions here, guys.

19:41.291 --> 19:42.458
Guys, wait. Wait.

19:42.541 --> 19:45.666
The file has been gone for hours,
and it still hasn't been leaked.

19:45.750 --> 19:49.833
It's like whoever did this just wanted
to turn this team against each other.

19:49.916 --> 19:52.375
And take this in the best way possible,

19:52.458 --> 19:55.333
my dad just doesn't care about you guys.

19:55.416 --> 19:57.583
It's true.
I don't even know most of your names.

19:57.666 --> 20:00.041
Reagan, I try to give everyone
the benefit of the doubt,

20:00.125 --> 20:02.750
but what's more likely,
that this was done by one of our gang

20:02.833 --> 20:06.208
or that it was done by your dad,
who's a psychopath alcoholic?

20:06.291 --> 20:09.500
I know him, Brett.
He is an asshole, but he's got a good--

20:09.583 --> 20:12.291
Heart? What did you say
about listening to your heart?

20:12.916 --> 20:14.666
Ethical conundrum detected.

20:14.750 --> 20:18.000
Who to trust,
your work family or your real family?

20:18.083 --> 20:21.166
You know, lording
your ethical superiority over people,

20:21.250 --> 20:22.541
it's not very ethical.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.875
Ethics aren't ethical?

20:24.958 --> 20:28.125
Error.
Moral relativism detected. Error.

20:29.750 --> 20:33.041
We can still find the mole,
save your job and this office.

20:33.125 --> 20:34.916
It's him or us, Reagan.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.458
Hand over your dad.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.458
Sorry, Brett.

20:42.541 --> 20:43.500
Bear-o.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.875
Does Reagan need a hug?

20:45.958 --> 20:48.125
-Dad, jump!
-That's my girl.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.708
Reagan, no.

20:54.041 --> 20:55.500
Oh no, they don't.

20:57.541 --> 21:00.000
-Come on, I know where we can hide out.
-What?

21:06.958 --> 21:10.208
Oh my gosh. Is there
a secret tunnel in the Mayan calendar?

21:10.291 --> 21:13.208
How do we have shit like that
but no paid maternity leave?

21:13.291 --> 21:16.625
-We gotta follow them.
-Into that shark-infested water?

21:16.708 --> 21:21.250
Watch out. I'm about to open a can
of dolphin-safe whoop-ass.

21:24.333 --> 21:27.541
-Ah, thanks for saving me, kiddo.
-Do not make me regret this.

21:27.625 --> 21:30.458
We have to prove that you're right,
or we're all getting fired,

21:30.541 --> 21:34.333
disappeared, and/or eaten by sharks.
Kind of a stakes overkill.

21:34.416 --> 21:36.791
-Yeah, a lot of redundant stakes.
-Stakes a-poppin'.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.916
And, uh, where the hell are we?

21:39.000 --> 21:42.875
Behind here is a surveillance feed
of the entire office.

21:42.958 --> 21:45.416
I built it during the height
of the cocaine crisis

21:45.500 --> 21:46.916
to weed out any squares.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.083
This is how we're gonna find that mole.

21:50.166 --> 21:53.875
You built a secret surveillance state
within a secret surveillance state?

21:53.958 --> 21:55.041
Ain't she pretty?

21:55.125 --> 21:57.708
Back in my day,
the cameras never stopped rolling,

21:57.791 --> 21:59.708
and the fear flowed like wine.

21:59.791 --> 22:01.250
-Ah.

22:01.333 --> 22:04.750
I wish I could go back
for the steady stream of groveling alone.

22:04.833 --> 22:06.708
-Kiddo?

22:06.791 --> 22:09.708
I thought I was gonna be
different from J.R.

22:09.791 --> 22:12.083
On my first day, I had to drug my team

22:12.166 --> 22:14.083
and ride a robot bear
through a shark tank.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.833
Don't forget you made
a morality robot self-destruct.

22:16.916 --> 22:19.583
Maybe I'm… maybe I'm not cut out for this.

22:19.666 --> 22:21.916
Hey, you made it further
than your old man.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.750
If I'd gotten
complete control of the company,

22:23.833 --> 22:25.916
I'd have spent my first morning,
I don't know,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.458
disappearing anybody
your mom's ever dated

22:28.541 --> 22:30.833
and just killing people for fun.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.375
Be a dear and access
the surveillance tapes.

22:34.458 --> 22:36.833
Daddy's gonna rustle up
some black cherry Tab.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.791
Welcome to the final room.

22:42.875 --> 22:45.958
One door rings true, one door spells doom.

22:46.041 --> 22:49.166
Choose a Robe's most favorite beast

22:49.250 --> 22:52.375
to ride to your coronation feast.

22:52.958 --> 22:54.666
Last trap, J.R.

22:54.750 --> 22:57.125
A Robe's most favorite beast.

22:57.625 --> 22:58.458
It's the bull.

22:58.541 --> 23:02.208
You wouldn't be tricking me
into mortal danger, would you?

23:02.291 --> 23:06.333
Why, I'd have to be a complete snake
to do something like that.

23:07.166 --> 23:08.250
Good point.

23:09.083 --> 23:12.375
-Once a liar, always a liar.

23:12.458 --> 23:16.208
Now, to accept my robe
and have you banished to a black site.

23:17.041 --> 23:18.416
-Ah!

23:20.041 --> 23:21.958
You're right, Oprah. I'm a liar,

23:22.041 --> 23:24.291
which is why
the only way I could deceive you

23:24.375 --> 23:26.833
was to tell the truth.

23:26.916 --> 23:30.250
You truth-telling son of a bitch.
How did you know the answer?

23:30.333 --> 23:32.708
The Robes love a bull market.

23:32.791 --> 23:35.625
And I should know. I'm about to be one!

23:47.375 --> 23:49.875
Jesus, I've seen potato clocks
with more RAM.

23:49.958 --> 23:53.958
-Reagan, we know you're in there!
-Guys, we need some time to find the mole.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.500
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

23:55.583 --> 23:58.333
You already have, Reagan.
You already have!

23:58.416 --> 24:00.125
I'm gonna need something to hold them off.

24:00.208 --> 24:01.708
Dad, is there anything in here

24:01.791 --> 24:03.916
that is not a computer
the size of a house?

24:04.000 --> 24:07.500
The animatronic cryptids.
Our first generation of conspiracies

24:07.583 --> 24:10.333
just had that charm
of practical effects, huh?

24:11.250 --> 24:13.125
Freedom!

24:13.208 --> 24:15.291
-Try me, dolphin.

24:21.166 --> 24:25.000
You don't know who you're fucking with.
I'm the man who killed disco.

24:31.708 --> 24:33.791
-Go for the jugular, Reagan.

24:33.875 --> 24:35.041
Show no mercy.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.208
Dad, these are my friends.

24:40.291 --> 24:42.333
I'm Brett's emergency contact.

24:42.416 --> 24:45.291
Maybe he could call you
after you murder him.

24:45.375 --> 24:47.083
I'm not murdering anyone!

24:47.166 --> 24:49.833
I am not that kind of boss!

24:54.166 --> 24:55.083
I'm the mole.

24:55.166 --> 24:56.083
What?

24:56.166 --> 24:58.000
I mean, not really.

24:58.083 --> 25:01.625
But we're all about to die
because we can't find the mole.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.791
I have to take this one for the team

25:03.875 --> 25:06.083
so there can be a team.

25:07.333 --> 25:08.750
Take me to Shadow prison.

25:08.833 --> 25:11.500
-Reagan, no, sweetie.
-There's gotta be another option.

25:11.583 --> 25:14.375
Well, I can't choose
between my family and my friends.

25:14.458 --> 25:17.375
I'm choosing to be a good boss
the only way I know how.

25:18.375 --> 25:20.083
The surveillance footage.

25:21.916 --> 25:23.500
You'll see I wasn't the mole.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.291
The mole was…

25:25.791 --> 25:28.583
Holy shit.

25:30.416 --> 25:32.000
Bear-o's the mole?

25:32.083 --> 25:34.750
-It's okay, Reagan.

25:35.250 --> 25:38.583
Do you need a hug?
