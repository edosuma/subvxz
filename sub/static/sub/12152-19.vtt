Hey, I'm praising Jasmine.
How about you?

38:01.973 --> 38:04.123
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:05.693 --> 38:08.890
Tonight, the role of Judas Iscariot
will be played by Krevlornswath...

38:09.053 --> 38:11.362
...of the Deathwok Clan.

38:13.573 --> 38:16.849
Hey, feeling the love, huh?
Thank you, Jasmine.

38:17.013 --> 38:18.890
Feeling the love.

38:19.053 --> 38:20.930
Hey, good news, my devoted darlings.

38:21.093 --> 38:25.132
Jasmine's pulling you off stacking duty,
wants to see us ASAP for a little TLC.

38:25.293 --> 38:26.772
Really?

38:26.933 --> 38:29.367
- I haven't sensed anything, have you?
- No.

38:29.533 --> 38:31.967
Everything else
has been feeling pretty clear.

38:34.613 --> 38:36.968
What happened to you?

38:38.373 --> 38:40.728
- What do you mean?
- Your wrist. You've cut it.

38:41.013 --> 38:43.288
Oh, it's... That is...

38:43.453 --> 38:46.365
That's a long, boring story. Come on.

39:05.533 --> 39:08.047
[THUDDING AND GRUNTING]

39:16.973 --> 39:18.645
How did you figure it out?

39:19.093 --> 39:20.526
It was Angel.

39:22.293 --> 39:24.523
He figured since Cordy
gave birth to Jasmine...

39:24.693 --> 39:27.571
...they might share a blood link
as well as a mystical one.

39:27.733 --> 39:33.126
We hoped Cordy's blood would have the
same effect when we exposed you to it.

39:33.293 --> 39:35.124
- Thanks for nothing.
LORNE: Yeah.

39:35.293 --> 39:38.729
You slashed this wrist, and
I'm ready to do the other one myself.

39:38.893 --> 39:41.453
Everything we believed...

39:42.613 --> 39:44.012
...deception.

39:44.173 --> 39:48.883
How do we convince several million
people that Jasmine's message is false?

39:49.053 --> 39:50.247
It's impossible.

39:50.413 --> 39:55.282
Even if we're able to develop a synthetic
analog to the blood, there's...

39:55.813 --> 39:58.964
I mean, how do we fight something
this huge and powerful?

39:59.133 --> 40:00.407
I don't know yet.

40:00.573 --> 40:03.849
But what I do know is that I'm not
leaving this hotel without my son.

40:06.973 --> 40:08.292
I'll get him.

40:09.973 --> 40:11.804
I've kidnapped him before.

40:31.453 --> 40:33.205
What?

40:34.533 --> 40:35.648
Hey...

40:35.813 --> 40:37.610
- No!
- It's gonna be okay.

40:38.693 --> 40:42.083
- You've been lied to. We all have.
ANGEL: Don't make this any harder.

40:42.253 --> 40:43.732
Let go!

40:45.933 --> 40:47.252
ANGEL:
Easy!

40:48.053 --> 40:49.406
Don't.

40:53.573 --> 40:55.609
- I'll kill you!
- It'll pass.

40:55.773 --> 40:58.333
Right, because Lord knows
he's never tried that before.

40:58.693 --> 41:00.331
You're back with us now, Connor.

41:08.533 --> 41:10.524
ANGEL:
Sorry.

41:10.773 --> 41:12.889
The only way to make you see.

41:13.533 --> 41:16.286
What you're feeling is normal.

41:16.453 --> 41:18.808
We're all feeling it, the sadness.

41:21.453 --> 41:24.365
It gets better after a while.

41:25.093 --> 41:27.163
Jasmine.

41:27.653 --> 41:29.883
You understand why we're here?
