WEBVTT

00:34.500 --> 00:36.600
<i>Yes?</i>

00:37.800 --> 00:39.700
Can I help you?

00:45.800 --> 00:47.700
Help.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.200
What happened?
You scrape your hand?

00:57.400 --> 00:59.900
<i>Come on in and, uh,</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:01.900
we'll fix you right up.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.800
<i>I haven't seen you around here.
What's your name?</i>

01:11.900 --> 01:14.300
<i>My God.
You"re hot.</i>

01:15.700 --> 01:19.200
You come on in now.
Sit over here.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.400
Damn.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.800
<i>Because I remember a
scripture that talked about the time...</i>

01:59.900 --> 02:01.800
of Herod and the land of Canaan
when the slaughter...

02:01.900 --> 02:04.900
of the innocent children of Israel
ran the streets red with blood.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.900
Red! Red! Amen!
Hallelujah!

02:17.900 --> 02:19.900
You fall
off your bike?

02:24.700 --> 02:28.300
Now go ahead and lie back.
Let me put this in your mouth.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.300
Come on now!
You're hot!

02:30.400 --> 02:33.400
Lie back.
Open. There.

02:35.800 --> 02:39.000
I'll take a look
at that hand.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.800
That's really deep.

02:58.300 --> 03:01.700
You shouldn't be
this far out.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.800
Oh, my God!

05:02.200 --> 05:05.700
<i>The Norman Rockwell age is dead.</i>

05:05.900 --> 05:08.900
<i>That's according to
social scientist Gareth Waltrip.</i>

05:09.000 --> 05:11.800
<i>Waltrip's recent study
on small-town life in America...</i>

05:11.900 --> 05:14.300
<i>claims that America's small towns
have suffered a loss...</i>

05:14.400 --> 05:17.800
<i>of 15% of their population
over the last decade.</i>

05:17.900 --> 05:20.200
<i>And more decay
is expected to come.</i>

05:20.300 --> 05:24.100
<i>The report cites the sale of small
farms, deterioration of family life...</i>

05:24.200 --> 05:27.200
<i>and the allure of the urban economy
as the primary causes.</i>

05:45.100 --> 05:47.000
Welcome home.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.400
Hi, Mom.
How you doing?

06:06.900 --> 06:09.200
Hi, Grace.

06:09.400 --> 06:13.400
<i>Thank you for coming.
I didn't know what else to do.</i>

06:20.400 --> 06:23.800
It's okay, Mom.
I'm here now.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.600
Hi, Doc.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.100
Hello, Grace.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.000
It's certainly nice
to have you back.

06:35.100 --> 06:38.500
The dean okayed me for one semester,
but he wasn't real happy about it.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.500
Maybe you shouldn't
have come.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.800
<i>I just... Doc?</i>

06:44.000 --> 06:46.900
Maybe I...
I shouldn't have called.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.100
It's okay, Mom.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.900
Hi, Grace.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.500
And who are you?
Are you the fairy princess?

06:57.600 --> 06:59.500
No. I'm Margaret.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.700
<i>- This is a costume.
- Oh.</i>

07:02.800 --> 07:05.300
I had a crown
but James took it.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.400
<i>He did?
Where is James?</i>

07:08.500 --> 07:10.400
<i>Outside.</i>

07:10.500 --> 07:13.100
And what's he up to?

07:21.500 --> 07:25.300
Margaret, let go of your sister.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.400
It's okay, Mom.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.000
<i>He is with
that damn bike.</i>

07:31.100 --> 07:34.600
He never listens anymore.
You know, he won't listen to me!

07:34.700 --> 07:38.800
- He never listens to anything I say to him.
- Mom, it... it's okay.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.900
Grace, will you
walk me to the car?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.900
<i>Sure, Doc.</i>

07:54.800 --> 07:57.100
- Welcome to Psycho Central.
- Hey, James.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.500
God, I had no idea
she was this bad.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.300
The nightmares are what
made her finally call.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.700
Now, if it
had gotten worse,

08:09.800 --> 08:12.900
I would've called you
myself personally.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.200
But I gave her
a prescription...

08:15.300 --> 08:17.200
so that she'll sleep
through the night.

08:17.300 --> 08:20.300
The really important thing is to just
simply get her out of the house.

08:20.400 --> 08:25.100
- She hasn't left the house?
- Well, agoraphobia's a funny thing.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.600
She'll come out,
but she won't take one step...

08:28.700 --> 08:30.800
past this end
of the walkway here.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.200
- You're kidding.
- That is it.

08:33.299 --> 08:36.100
Now, what we have
to do is...

08:36.200 --> 08:38.100
relax her.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.100
Try not to let her
hear any bad news.

08:40.200 --> 08:44.700
<i>When she sees the world as
a safe place, she"ll come around.</i>

08:44.800 --> 08:46.900
<i>Why, good afternoon, ladies.</i>

08:47.000 --> 08:49.300
Is she here for
the children, Doc?

08:49.400 --> 08:51.800
Yes, ma'am.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.200
That and her mother.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.800
Oh, my God.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.800
Jane and Rosa Nock.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.900
They don't have much,
but what they have they...

09:01.000 --> 09:04.200
Well, they try to share it
with my homebound patients.

09:04.300 --> 09:07.300
<i>Probably left some turkey pot pie
for your mother.</i>

09:08.400 --> 09:10.800
Oh, uh, Dr. Larson,

09:10.900 --> 09:13.800
<i>I, um, I hate
to even ask this.</i>

09:13.900 --> 09:15.900
<i>You've done so much.</i>

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
While I'm here
I've nothing coming in, so...

09:19.100 --> 09:23.500
<i>- I was wondering...
- Say no more. You've got your old job back.</i>

09:23.600 --> 09:25.500
Thanks.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.800
<i>I"ll see you
first thing in the morning.</i>

12:38.500 --> 12:43.600
To those who take strong drink,
He shall send angels.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.200
Please...
Please, God, help me.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.700
I have come for the children.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.300
Charles Manson. Scorpio.
Killed eight people and an unborn baby.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.300
Favorite food:
Pistachio ice cream.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.300
Lovely.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.400
Great guitar player.
Could've been a rock star.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.100
<i>- I got all 30 of them.
- Hmm.</i>

13:30.200 --> 13:33.300
Who says kids don't
have heroes anymore?

13:33.400 --> 13:37.200
Grace, how long
are you going to stay?

13:37.300 --> 13:39.400
I'll stay 'til
Mom's feeling better.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.200
They should just throw her in
the cracker factory and call it a day.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.500
James.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.200
Is Mom a crackpot?

13:47.600 --> 13:50.600
Look, Mom's just...
She's sick.

13:50.700 --> 13:53.400
And sometimes she gets real nervous
and then she gets afraid.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.300
But you and I both know there's
nothing to be afraid of, right?

13:57.500 --> 14:00.800
<i>- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Good.</i>

14:00.900 --> 14:03.600
Now sleep tight.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.800
Grace.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.700
I like you better than Mom.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.700
Go to sleep.

14:21.700 --> 14:26.400
And then
the thermometer drops.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.700
And then...

14:28.900 --> 14:31.100
it breaks.

14:31.200 --> 14:35.000
And then...

14:35.100 --> 14:37.000
the boy...

14:37.100 --> 14:39.400
When I turn,

14:39.500 --> 14:41.600
he tries to...

14:41.700 --> 14:44.800
<i>Come on, Mom.
We can beat this thing.</i>

14:44.900 --> 14:47.800
<i>Now, let's get this place
cleaned up, okay?</i>

14:50.700 --> 14:53.700
That's all
I can remember.

14:53.800 --> 14:58.500
I can never, never remember
how it starts.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.800
It happens every night
like that.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.000
It's just
a nightmare.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.900
Just take the pills Doc Rob gave you
and it'll go away.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.700
Why don't you
go upstairs?

15:22.800 --> 15:25.500
I'll finish up here.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.500
Thanks, Grace.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.700
Mom, we're not Catholic.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.000
I know.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.000
Crazy.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.900
Does the word "recycling"
mean anything to you?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.800
Grace, I'm hot.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.200
Okay. Time.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.099
Blech.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.300
Well, you've got a little fever,
but I think you'll live.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.700
Good. I wanna live.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.200
Keep this washcloth
on your head.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.300
If you need anything
during the night, just yell.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.300
<i>- Grace.
- Okay.</i>

17:32.400 --> 17:35.800
James is feverish too.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.800
Oh, great.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.200
What do you think it is?
I mean...

17:41.300 --> 17:44.800
It's probably just the flu, Mom.
Kids get sick.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.300
Cavalry's here.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.500
You never were
the fucking Brady Bunch.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.400
Tell me about it.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.700
So, looks like I'm gonna be
joining you in Doc Rob's office.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.700
No. You won't.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.400
You're lookin' at the new nurse
at Grand Island Junior High.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.400
- No way!
- Yeah.

18:14.500 --> 18:17.500
You can hear those teen boys' hormones
just poppin' clear down the hall.

18:19.700 --> 18:22.300
And everything's
exactly the same.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.800
How'd we grow up
so fast?

18:24.900 --> 18:27.000
You grew up a little quicker than me.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.800
Thanks for your support.

18:32.400 --> 18:36.700
Just maybe you should think
about coming home to stay.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.400
Look,

18:40.500 --> 18:45.300
I'm just here to get Mom on her feet,
then I'm going back to school.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.500
Open up.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.300
- Come on, Michael. Help me out here.
- Uh-huh.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.900
- Tastes like a strawberry.
- You lie.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.900
<i>Michael. I'm sorry.</i>

19:36.000 --> 19:38.100
He usually doesn't mind
having his temperature taken.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.200
<i>- It's okay. I'll just
have to get the digital.</i>

19:44.100 --> 19:46.000
Hello. Clinic.

19:46.100 --> 19:51.700
<i>Well, just keep an eye on the fever
and don't let it go above 102.</i>

19:51.800 --> 19:54.200
<i>I have to go.
I'm sorry. Good-bye.</i>

20:19.400 --> 20:22.300
<i>So, are you going to that
new treatment center in Denver?</i>

20:22.400 --> 20:25.600
This week. The special kid
needs special treatment.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.800
I'm not the one who needs
the special treatment.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.300
Have you got a decent
clotting agent at the house?

20:31.400 --> 20:33.300
Yeah, we've got plenty
of it around the house...

20:33.400 --> 20:35.600
and we all know how to use it
in case of an emergency.

20:35.800 --> 20:39.100
Well, I'd say you've got
the same fever as these other kids.

20:39.200 --> 20:43.100
<i>But hemophilia is serious business.
I don't want you to get cut anymore.</i>

20:43.200 --> 20:46.000
One hundred percent
operational, captain.

20:46.100 --> 20:49.400
<i>- Are you excited about this move?
- Yeah.</i>

20:49.500 --> 20:52.200
I'll be with you guys
in just a minute, okay?

20:53.500 --> 20:56.400
We'll get to you two next.
Hang in there, okay?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
So, what do you think?

21:03.100 --> 21:05.300
Why don't you
tell me, Doctor?

21:05.400 --> 21:07.700
I don't know.
Fevers, shakes.

21:07.800 --> 21:12.200
Definitely flu of some kind.
But no nausea, no diarrhea. No sinus.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.200
Viruses are
always changing.

21:15.300 --> 21:17.400
That's what makes 'em
such a fun date.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.700
I think I'll keep the more
serious ones here tonight.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.700
I hope you don't
have any plans.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.700
<i>Mmm.</i>

22:16.700 --> 22:19.100
Come to me.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.000
He's also 103.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.300
She reads the same.
Flour patients and no fluctuation?

23:15.300 --> 23:17.700
Mom!

23:26.400 --> 23:28.300
Dad.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.400
Mom. Mom.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.700
<i>Plenty of wet towels, yes.</i>

23:47.800 --> 23:50.600
If it goes two-tenths
of a point higher, bring him in.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.500
Grace.

24:03.100 --> 24:06.400
Charlie, honey.
Oh, my God.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.100
- Marcus?
- Dad.

24:14.500 --> 24:17.700
Jesus, these kids are going up fast.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.300
We've gotta break this.
Prep an ice bath.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.700
- Charlie, I'm putting you in.
- No! Mom!

24:46.600 --> 24:49.400
- Is it ready?
- Almost!

24:49.500 --> 24:51.400
Honey, I'm gonna
cool you off.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.500
No! Mom!

24:58.800 --> 25:01.400
I'm comin' in.
Grab the other one.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.400
Mom!

25:05.600 --> 25:07.700
You've got to
stay there and cool off.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.100
We have to cool you down.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.400
<i>- Grace!
- I"ll get the last one.</i>

25:16.500 --> 25:18.400
Calm down.
One more time.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.200
Come on.
Help me out here.

25:20.300 --> 25:22.500
Lie down. Down, down.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.500
Grace!

25:31.100 --> 25:34.500
Grace!

25:45.600 --> 25:47.500
Okay. That's it.
We're done.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.800
- Are you warm enough?
- Yeah.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Okay.
Well, go to sleep.

26:56.900 --> 27:00.500
She was calling for you...
by the road.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.600
But she's come in now.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.200
Thanks.
Thank you.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.900
I'm gonna head off.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.900
You keep an eye on 'em
for the rest of the night,

27:24.100 --> 27:26.700
<i>but call me immediately
if anything changes.</i>

27:26.800 --> 27:28.900
Okay, Doc.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.600
You still sure you want
to go into medicine?

27:59.300 --> 28:01.200
That's it. Very nice.

28:01.300 --> 28:04.200
Okay. All set.
Go say hello to Dad.

28:04.300 --> 28:05.700
Hey.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.500
You can take him home today
if you want, but he seems fine.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.500
- Just like that?
- Well, he's asymptomatic. All the kids are.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.500
Thanks.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.400
So... that's it?

28:18.500 --> 28:20.400
Looks like it.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.200
- Whatever it was, it's gone.
- Whew.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.300
Hail Mary, mother of God,

28:27.400 --> 28:29.400
pray for us sinners now...

28:29.600 --> 28:31.500
Hail Mary, mother of God.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.500
Mary, mother of God.

28:36.700 --> 28:39.300
Mary, mother of...

28:40.700 --> 28:44.600
Now and at the hour of death...

28:44.700 --> 28:46.600
God!

29:05.900 --> 29:09.100
<i>[Sirens]</i>

29:09.200 --> 29:11.900
<i>Let's go, kid. Bedtime.</i>

29:17.600 --> 29:20.100
Big day tomorrow.
Big move.

29:24.200 --> 29:28.300
So you'll be a smaller fish
in a much bigger pond. That's okay.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.900
- I liked being a big fish.
- Hey.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.800
So, when we get to Denver,
you can run for mayor.

29:37.100 --> 29:40.400
<i>...the slaughter of the innocent
children of Israel...</i>

29:40.500 --> 29:42.600
<i>ran the streets
red with blood.</i>

29:42.700 --> 29:45.100
<i>Red! Red!
Amen! Halleluiah!</i>

29:45.200 --> 29:48.600
<i>According to God's plan...</i>

29:58.500 --> 30:02.700
I can't pry that kid away from that
idiot box. We ought to leave it here.

30:02.900 --> 30:05.900
<i>- It's not an idiot box when Oprah is on.
- That's educational.</i>

30:06.000 --> 30:08.600
Marcus, what did I
just get done telling you?

30:08.700 --> 30:11.600
Go to bed.
We're moving in the morning.

30:11.700 --> 30:14.100
I can't go.

30:19.300 --> 30:22.500
<i>Donald? Donald!</i>

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
- Sandra?
- No! No!

30:27.100 --> 30:29.600
<i>Sandra!</i>

30:29.700 --> 30:32.400
Marcus!
Sandra!

30:32.500 --> 30:35.400
<i>Sandra!</i>

30:53.800 --> 30:56.500
<i>Margaret, did you
burn yourself here?</i>

30:56.600 --> 30:58.000
No.

30:58.100 --> 31:01.200
You weren't playing in any leaves,
maybe poison ivy?

31:04.000 --> 31:06.400
Okay. Sleep tight.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.400
Okay.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.600
<i>16-Crash-21, Foothill.</i>

31:16.700 --> 31:21.300
<i>A male white, thin
build, 20 to 25 years in a rear yard...</i>

31:21.400 --> 31:24.300
I'm not saying that you did,
and I'm not saying that you didn't.

31:24.400 --> 31:27.600
We do have ourselves a little situation
here, now don't we, Donald?

31:27.700 --> 31:30.900
Sheriff, I don't know what happened
in that house tonight,

31:31.000 --> 31:33.800
<i>but something attacked us, Sheriff.</i>

31:33.900 --> 31:37.400
<i>And now something's
wrong with my boy.</i>

31:37.500 --> 31:40.800
It never looks good
for the husband, Donald.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.100
<i>Look at him, Sheriff.
Look at him.</i>

31:45.200 --> 31:48.800
<i>Marcus! Marcus, you stay near now.
We"re gonna need you.</i>

31:50.000 --> 31:53.100
<i>Marcus!
Smitty, watch this guy.</i>

31:56.800 --> 31:58.700
Marcus!

32:11.200 --> 32:13.100
Marcus?

32:14.700 --> 32:16.800
<i>Come on, son!</i>

32:32.300 --> 32:36.500
I know you've seen some
scary things tonight, son,

32:36.600 --> 32:39.700
<i>but if you come on back
we can help you.</i>

32:45.900 --> 32:48.100
Marcus!

32:50.700 --> 32:53.600
Come on in, son!

33:12.400 --> 33:14.300
Marcus!

33:15.800 --> 33:19.400
All right, son!
I'm gonna count to three.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.200
You better come in
or you're gonna be in big trouble.

33:23.300 --> 33:25.900
One...

33:26.000 --> 33:28.100
two...

33:28.300 --> 33:30.200
three!

33:32.000 --> 33:35.200
<i>Sheriff.</i>

33:38.600 --> 33:40.800
<i>- All right, son.
- Sheriff.</i>

33:40.900 --> 33:43.900
<i>We"re gonna get ya.
- Sheriff.</i>

33:57.200 --> 33:59.200
<i>Sheriff.</i>

33:59.300 --> 34:01.100
Marcus?

34:01.200 --> 34:02.100
Sheriff.

34:25.699 --> 34:28.600
<i>- What was that?
- Oh, my God!</i>

34:55.900 --> 34:58.400
<i>There's a gate down there.</i>

34:58.500 --> 35:01.100
<i>They went through here.</i>

35:05.700 --> 35:07.700
<i>Okay, good idea.</i>

35:14.200 --> 35:16.100
Grace?

35:18.100 --> 35:20.000
Grace!

35:23.600 --> 35:25.600
Grace!

35:28.200 --> 35:30.100
What's the matter,
honey?

35:30.200 --> 35:33.800
You feel okay?
You hot again?

35:35.400 --> 35:37.300
Help me.

35:52.500 --> 35:56.400
- Yaaah!
- Aaaaah!

36:11.700 --> 36:13.600
Mrs. Nock?

36:13.700 --> 36:16.400
We heard
about your trouble.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.300
Something's wrong
with my boy.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.900
Sandra's dead.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.400
They think I did it.
I need a place to hide.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.400
There's no need
to explain.

36:52.700 --> 36:54.600
Ow!
Why do you need it?

36:54.700 --> 36:58.400
Well, our machine will tell us
what the blood is made out of.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.400
Gross.

37:03.900 --> 37:07.900
Now let's see what this will do
for those little markings there.

37:10.600 --> 37:14.400
- Ow!
- That doesn't hurt. It's supposed to feel good.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.800
I don't like it.

37:19.200 --> 37:23.600
- Did Mom ever tell you you had any allergies?
- No.

37:23.700 --> 37:28.000
Well!
You two are in early.

37:28.100 --> 37:31.600
Oh, she had some little rashes. I wanted
to get a look at them and take some blood.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.600
Want me to take a peek?

37:33.700 --> 37:37.400
Oh, I don't think it's anything.
It's probably just an allergy.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.600
I'm gonna run her
to school.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.800
So, how's your mother
holding up?

37:41.900 --> 37:45.200
She's gettin' there. The medication seems
to help, and the house is shaping up.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.800
Have you considered
coming back?

37:47.900 --> 37:52.400
Oh, Doc, I just want to handle this
thing with Mom. Then I can think.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.700
Enough said.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.400
<i>Police are still
searching for Donald Atkins.</i>

38:08.500 --> 38:11.600
<i>He's wanted for questioning regarding
the bizarre double murder...</i>

38:11.700 --> 38:13.900
<i>of his wife and
Sheriff Biggs last night.</i>

38:14.000 --> 38:16.900
<i>Atkins fled the crime scene
and shortly afterward...</i>

38:17.000 --> 38:19.500
<i>police discovered the body of
the sheriff in a nearby cornfield.</i>

38:19.600 --> 38:22.500
<i>Apparently, the sheriff was searching
for the couple's son, Marcus.</i>

38:22.600 --> 38:25.500
<i>At the moment, there is no sign
of either father or son.</i>

38:25.600 --> 38:28.000
<i>Police are asking
that anyone...</i>

38:28.100 --> 38:31.000
<i>with any information on the two
contact them immediately.</i>

38:53.200 --> 38:55.600
Oh. Janet.

38:55.700 --> 38:59.600
I'm sorry, Dr. Robbie, but
they've been acting so strangely.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.500
<i>Ever since they got sick,
they just won't listen to me.</i>

39:02.600 --> 39:07.000
I thought they were teasing me,
you know, but I don't...

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
How're you doin' there,
Scott?

39:12.100 --> 39:13.800
I'm not Scott.

39:13.900 --> 39:16.400
Oh, then you
must be Scott.

39:18.300 --> 39:21.500
- I'm Zeke.
- I'm Caleb.

39:21.600 --> 39:26.200
<i>I told them to stop. They just won't
quit, Doc. What do you think it is?</i>

39:26.300 --> 39:28.700
What I think it is
is they're pulling your leg,

39:28.800 --> 39:31.500
and I think you're about
to collapse from exhaustion.

39:31.600 --> 39:35.700
Now, go on home and get you some sleep.
I'll keep them here tonight.

39:35.900 --> 39:38.600
<i>- Are you sure?
- I will keep an eye on them.</i>

39:38.700 --> 39:41.900
<i>I don't want to see you back here
'til you've had ten solid hours.</i>

39:42.000 --> 39:43.900
Okay.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.700
Well, now. All right.

39:51.800 --> 39:55.400
You want to tell me what's
going on here, Charlie?

39:55.500 --> 39:57.500
I'm not Charlie.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.100
Do you boys know
how old I am?

40:06.200 --> 40:10.200
<i>Well... I'm pretty old.</i>

40:11.600 --> 40:16.400
I've lived here in Grand Isle
my entire life.

40:16.500 --> 40:19.400
I was around during
the Second World War.

40:19.500 --> 40:22.100
I was around during the Depression.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.800
<i>Did you know that?</i>

40:24.900 --> 40:28.400
But when I was a boy here,
there was a set of twins...

40:28.500 --> 40:30.800
a couple years older
than I was.

40:30.900 --> 40:34.600
They weren't bad boys,
but they had a lot of...

40:34.700 --> 40:37.300
bad things and sad things
in their lives.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.700
<i>Do you know
what I'm getting at?</i>

40:39.800 --> 40:43.300
Ezekiel and Caleb Cuff.

40:47.900 --> 40:51.100
Do you know what happened
to the Cuff boys?

40:51.200 --> 40:54.700
They were killed
by their father.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.700
One of them was shot...

40:57.800 --> 41:01.400
and the other
was cut with a knife.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.800
Do you think
that is a funny thing?

41:04.900 --> 41:06.900
It is not.

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
And I don't think your little joke
is a funny thing, either.

41:12.100 --> 41:15.400
I'm going to suggest
to your mother...

41:15.500 --> 41:18.900
that she blister
your little behinds...

41:19.000 --> 41:21.200
real good.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.200
You understand me, Scott?

41:23.300 --> 41:26.400
I'm not Scott.

41:33.400 --> 41:38.300
I take the pills.
I do. I take them.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.400
But it just gets worse.

41:41.500 --> 41:44.300
Shhh.
It'll be okay, Mom.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.300
It will.

41:46.400 --> 41:50.800
The dream is getting worse, Grace.

41:52.900 --> 41:55.200
I close my eyes...

41:55.300 --> 41:57.500
and he's there.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.200
The boy is there.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.600
I told you to wait out front,
young man.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.200
Where is your brother?

42:31.300 --> 42:33.700
In bed.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.900
It's too late for that.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.200
<i>You boys have been
looking for trouble,</i>

42:40.300 --> 42:43.100
and now you are going
to get it!

42:50.300 --> 42:52.200
<i>Doc!</i>

42:56.000 --> 42:59.900
All right, boys.
That's enough!

43:00.000 --> 43:02.100
Boys!

43:04.200 --> 43:06.400
Boys!

43:06.500 --> 43:09.500
Yaaaaaah!

43:18.400 --> 43:21.100
He's back.

44:20.500 --> 44:23.500
Oh, my God!

44:28.500 --> 44:30.400
Hello?

44:34.500 --> 44:36.400
Doc?

44:56.400 --> 44:59.600
I don't want to hurt you.
The kids. Where are the kids?

44:59.700 --> 45:02.700
You were testing them.
You saw Marcus Atkins. Where is he?

45:02.800 --> 45:05.500
He's gone.
Disappeared with the sheriff.

45:05.700 --> 45:07.600
Something was wrong
with him.

45:07.700 --> 45:10.900
He saw what had happened.
He was in shock.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.300
Wait a minute.
You murdered Sandra.

45:13.400 --> 45:17.200
No, I didn't kill her! Something happened
in the house. Something happened to Marcus.

45:17.300 --> 45:19.600
<i>He was sick.
They were all sick.</i>

45:19.700 --> 45:21.700
It was just a virus,
but it's gone now.

45:21.800 --> 45:24.900
<i>- It did something to him. The fever.
- No, that's impossible.</i>

45:25.000 --> 45:27.600
Then why are you here?

45:27.700 --> 45:29.600
<i>What is that?</i>

45:29.700 --> 45:31.700
Blood tests
for my sister.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.000
<i>- What does it say?
- I don't know. I'm not a doctor.</i>

45:34.100 --> 45:36.000
What does it say?

45:36.100 --> 45:38.400
The readings
don't make any sense.

45:38.600 --> 45:41.000
There must have been something
wrong with the machine.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.100
<i>Something
is wrong with her.</i>

45:43.200 --> 45:45.400
She has it too.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.900
Whatever happened to my boy
is going to happen to her...

45:52.000 --> 45:54.400
<i>and the rest of them,
all of them.</i>

45:54.500 --> 45:58.300
All I want to do is find
my boy, bury my wife...

45:58.400 --> 46:01.600
and get the hell out
of this godforsaken town.

46:15.300 --> 46:18.000
Why do we have to
do it again? Ow.

46:18.100 --> 46:22.600
The machine that analyzes blood didn't do
it right last time, so we needed some more.

46:22.700 --> 46:24.800
But we don't like it.

46:24.900 --> 46:27.400
Well, I had to do it too.

46:27.500 --> 46:30.100
Okay, guys,
let's get you to school.

46:55.900 --> 46:57.900
<i>Margaret, are you
feeling all right?</i>

47:01.300 --> 47:04.900
James? James.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.700
I can't get the door.

47:09.100 --> 47:10.900
I can't get it.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.800
Margaret, what's wrong?

47:36.200 --> 47:38.600
I'm not Margaret.

48:36.100 --> 48:38.900
What do you want?

48:59.200 --> 49:01.300
I haven't seen you
around here.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.400
What's your name?

49:04.800 --> 49:08.200
Whew! My God,
you're hot!

49:10.300 --> 49:12.900
You stay right here.

49:36.900 --> 49:38.500
Damn!

49:44.600 --> 49:47.700
<i>I remember a scripture...</i>

49:47.800 --> 49:50.700
<i>that talked about the time
of Herod in the land of Canaan...</i>

49:50.800 --> 49:54.700
<i>when the slaughter of the innocent children
of Israel ran the streets red with blood.</i>

49:54.800 --> 49:57.200
<i>Red! Red!
Amen! Halleluiah!</i>

49:57.300 --> 50:00.700
<i>According to God's plan,
those children of Israel...</i>

51:14.200 --> 51:17.900
We're going to see
the doctor right now, okay?

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Margaret, look at me.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Jesus.

51:34.100 --> 51:37.400
Something's wrong with my boy.
You said he was better.

51:37.500 --> 51:41.600
- We're doing everything we can.
- His teeth are falling out. He's calling himself names.

51:41.700 --> 51:43.900
- What's wrong?
- I've got a lot to do.

51:44.100 --> 51:46.300
You're not a doctor.
I want to see Doc Rob.

51:46.400 --> 51:51.400
So do I, but right now I'm all you've
got, so sit down and let me do my job.

51:51.500 --> 51:55.300
Okay, now listen up. Mrs. Becker,
take room one. You're first.

51:55.400 --> 51:58.000
Mrs. Amos, room two.
Mrs. Crandall, room three.

51:58.100 --> 52:00.700
Mary Anne, get back here.
You're my new nurse.

52:03.300 --> 52:05.600
Put this in your mouth
and bite on it.

52:05.700 --> 52:07.700
Come on, Doc.

52:07.800 --> 52:12.400
Where's Doc Rob?
I have complete chaos at the school.

52:12.500 --> 52:15.800
There's no answer.
He must be on his way in.

52:15.900 --> 52:18.900
I ran a blood test on her
that was totally off the scale.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.600
And Margaret's teeth, she pulled out
every one of her fillings.

52:22.700 --> 52:24.500
Grace.

52:27.700 --> 52:31.100
I don't wanna be in charge when their heads
start doing 360's and they're hurling pea soup.

52:31.200 --> 52:36.100
Get blood from these kids, give them
gauze to chew on and find Doc Rob.

52:43.800 --> 52:45.800
James!

53:00.900 --> 53:02.900
James?

53:18.500 --> 53:20.400
Jamie?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.900
Jamie?

53:49.400 --> 53:51.300
<i>Mom?</i>

53:57.100 --> 53:59.000
<i>Mom!</i>

53:59.100 --> 54:01.000
Jamie?

54:07.700 --> 54:09.600
Jamie?

54:59.700 --> 55:02.700
<i>We"ll show Doc Rob
the blood tests and give you a call.</i>

55:02.800 --> 55:05.500
<i>- I appreciate it. Thank you.
- Thanks for coming by.</i>

55:05.600 --> 55:08.300
- What the hell is going on?
- That was County General.

55:08.400 --> 55:11.400
<i>They"re sending out
the toxicology team in the morning.</i>

55:11.500 --> 55:13.700
A voodoo doctor
might be a better idea.

55:13.800 --> 55:16.700
I want to know
where the fuck Rob is!

55:16.800 --> 55:19.500
And where are all the files
on these kids?

55:19.600 --> 55:22.000
Every medical record
on a child is missing.

55:22.100 --> 55:25.400
Doc Rob must've taken them. I'm gonna
take these results and go by his house.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.900
<i>He's an old man.
Maybe he kicked it.</i>

55:28.000 --> 55:31.100
Grace, don't even
think about it.

55:31.200 --> 55:33.100
<i>What?</i>

55:33.200 --> 55:36.000
Mary Anne,
this blood sample...

55:36.100 --> 55:39.100
Mine looks fine,
but the kid's is...

55:39.300 --> 55:41.200
What is it?

55:41.300 --> 55:44.000
Where are my boys?
Doc Rob has my boys.

55:44.100 --> 55:46.700
I'm going to get them
right now.

55:46.800 --> 55:50.500
Mary Anne, this blood is not
properly oxygenating.

55:50.600 --> 55:53.600
It's decayed. It's like
it's mixed with something dead.

55:53.700 --> 55:57.400
That's it. Check, please.
I'm out of here.

55:57.500 --> 56:00.800
- Mary Anne, come on.
- No way, Grace! This shit is creeping me out big time!

56:00.900 --> 56:04.800
Run the rest of those samples
and look for something chemical.

56:04.900 --> 56:07.700
I'm going to Doc Rob's.
Come on, Margaret.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.300
<i>Come on.
Get in the car.</i>

56:17.300 --> 56:19.900
- Leave the child.
- Look, we have to find a doctor.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
Leave the child.
You and I have someplace to go.

56:24.800 --> 56:28.600
Margaret, you have to stay
with Mary Anne for now.

56:31.600 --> 56:33.900
Okay, drive.
Let's go.

57:03.500 --> 57:05.800
Mrs. Nock,
this is Grace.

57:05.900 --> 57:08.800
I know who it is.
Come.

57:08.900 --> 57:10.800
<i>Listen.</i>

57:12.900 --> 57:15.500
Harvest moon's up.

57:20.700 --> 57:22.800
Do you know
what that is?

57:22.900 --> 57:24.800
<i>Traveling preachers.</i>

57:24.900 --> 57:26.900
<i>Tent revivals.</i>

57:27.100 --> 57:29.800
Old-time religion.

57:29.900 --> 57:34.000
<i>Those preachers
wanted our money.</i>

57:34.100 --> 57:37.200
And we wanted
to believe.

57:38.900 --> 57:40.800
There was a boy...

57:40.900 --> 57:44.000
that boy...

57:44.100 --> 57:46.900
born of sin
to a young girl.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.700
It was a scandal...
back then.

57:54.200 --> 57:56.500
She up and left him.

57:56.600 --> 58:00.500
One of those travelin'
preachers took him in.

58:00.600 --> 58:02.700
So the boy took
to preachin'.

58:02.800 --> 58:05.100
<i>Like it was in his blood.</i>

58:05.200 --> 58:08.200
He had the gift,
he did.

58:08.300 --> 58:12.400
We'd come from miles around
just to hear him.

58:12.500 --> 58:15.700
<i>He'd scorch you with
the fear of hellfire,</i>

58:15.800 --> 58:18.700
<i>then raise you up to Heaven,
that boy.</i>

58:18.800 --> 58:23.300
They called him
Josiah.

58:23.400 --> 58:27.200
Josiah, the amazing
boy preacher.

58:27.300 --> 58:31.100
<i>Great crowds would
gather round to listen.</i>

58:31.200 --> 58:36.200
<i>And he made them adult preachers
rich as kings, he did.</i>

58:36.300 --> 58:39.200
But somethin' was wrong.

58:40.800 --> 58:43.500
Summer after summer,

58:43.600 --> 58:46.500
the tents
would come around,

58:46.600 --> 58:50.800
and the boy was
still just a boy.

59:33.700 --> 59:35.600
Oh, shit.

59:54.100 --> 59:56.900
Every summer,

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.900
the amazing boy preacher
would be the same age,

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.800
the same size.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:11.400
<i>They knew if he grew up,
the money would stop.</i>

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:15.000
So them wicked preachers...

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.100
<i>tried everything:
Kept him from sleep,</i>

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.800
fed him quicksilver...

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.900
poison.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.900
<i>To stunt his growth,
but it didn't work.</i>

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.300
But it just made
the boy crazy.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.800
<i>Finally,</i>

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.500
they took the step.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.500
<i>Gave him over.</i>

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.200
Wh... What do you mean,
"gave him over"?

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.700
<i>The darkness kept Josiah small.</i>

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.300
<i>But we learned the secret,
left the tents.</i>

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:49.300
Preachers didn't have
no use for Josiah no more,

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.800
<i>so they left him.</i>

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.000
<i>Like his mother done.</i>

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:01.600
He done them
preachers back good.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.100
With a harvestin' scythe.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.800
Up on the Spelling ranch.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:10.700
<i>In the dark of night.</i>

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.300
Jesus Christ.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.600
So we did
what we had to.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:22.300
Townspeople...

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.800
dragged that boy
out of the house.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:30.200
Dragged him out
to the cornfield...

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.900
and burned him up.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.900
- And the boy cried.
- I could feel him.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.900
<i>All through
the night...</i>

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
<i>I could still feel it.</i>

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.700
<i>Long after he should've been dead.</i>

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.200
<i>Next day we searched
the fields,</i>

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.300
<i>gathered every one
of the bones,</i>

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.300
the ashes.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.900
And deep in a well...

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.900
<i>we sealed the soul
of that wicked boy preacher.</i>

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:31.800
He's found a child.
One like himself.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:36.400
<i>And when that like child
takes his place,</i>

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.200
Josiah will take them all.

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.300
What do you mean,
"like child"?

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.600
Left. Abandoned.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.400
<i>You must kill the boy.</i>

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.700
Send his spirit to hell!

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.800
Take back the like child!

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.300
<i>Don't make my mistake!</i>

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:02.200
- Let's go.
- It all starts with a lie, girl.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:06.800
- It all starts with a lie.
- Let's go.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:09.200
Take back the child!

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.500
What is it?
What do you know?

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.500
This thing has got my boy.
You tell me what you know now.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.700
Margaret is the like child.
I abandoned her and I lied to her.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.700
Your sister?

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.200
She's my daughter.
Get in the fucking car.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.200
Margaret, I think
it's time to go.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.200
Margaret!

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.200
Margaret?

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.000
Margaret?

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.300
Margaret!

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.800
<i>- Grace!
- Oh, my God.</i>

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.400
Margaret!

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.800
- We have to find her! We've gotta get her back!
- Wait a minute. Hold on.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:48.500
- Look. Look at this. What is this?
- It's mercurochrome ointment.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:52.600
<i>Margaret hated it. That stuff and
fillings. They"re both made of mercury.</i>

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:57.800
- The boy. The boy was poisoned with quicksilver.
- Right.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.200
Quicksilver is mercury.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.400
Where's the
supply closet?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.900
Rosa.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.000
<i>It's time.</i>

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.500
Your boy's come home.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.900
I am Ezekiel and
I bring Him my flesh.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.500
I am Caleb and
I bring Him my flesh.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.900
<i>Let's take the truck.</i>

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.200
No, no, no.
You drive.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.400
By the looks of the moon,
we got about an hour.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.400
<i>- Where are we going?
- Spelling farm.</i>

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.600
That's where he killed those preachers
and where the townspeople burned him.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.100
Right, but what are we gonna do
when we get there?

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.200
I don't know, but I see
a lot of blood flowing.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.300
And if my son gets as much as a cut
on him, he's gonna bleed to death.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.300
Let's go.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.100
I'm Herbert.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.600
He comes with the blood
of children.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.500
With my soul,
He will lead them.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.100
What are you doing?

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.700
Spiking these shells
with mercury.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:31.200
If this kid really hates this stuff, then this
oughta send him right back where he came from.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.300
<i>Watch it!
Where the hell are you going?</i>

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.500
Short cut.

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:47.399
We bring Him our flesh.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.899
We bring Him our flesh.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.200
We bring Him our flesh.

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.700
We bring Him our flesh!

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.000
We bring Him our flesh!

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.200
We bring Him our flesh!

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.700
We bring Him our flesh!

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.500
We bring Him our flesh!

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.500
We bring Him our flesh!

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.899
We bring Him our flesh!

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.200
We bring Him our flesh!

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:13.600
We bring Him our flesh!

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.399
We bring Him our flesh!

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.100
<i>We bring Him our flesh!</i>

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.100
<i>We bring Him our flesh!</i>

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:50.200
These two red ones, they're filled with
mercury. Use these on the bad kid.

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.800
The black ones,
they're regular 12-gauge, all right?

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:56.400
- And what do we use those for?
- I hope not to shoot children.

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.500
Oh, my God.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.700
Oh, my God.

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.500
That's Marcus.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.900
Grace, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:57.700
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know. Come on. Let's go.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.700
<i>Come on.</i>

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.900
<i>Damn. I hope we brought
enough of this stuff.</i>

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.500
Grace. Grace.
I gotta get Marcus.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.500
You keep the gun.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.800
Margaret?

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.000
Margaret?

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.600
Hang in there.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.900
Marcus, hang in there.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.900
Don't die on me now.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.200
Just hang in there, buddy.
This'll do it, okay?

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:31.600
This is gonna do it.
Just hang in there, okay?

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:57.400
Margaret?

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.000
<i>My God.</i>

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.700
Bastard.

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:47.200
Oh.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:53.000
<i>I hope she can swim.</i>

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:04.800
<i>Doc? Oh, shit.</i>

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.900
Shit! Black ones.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.600
Shit!

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.800
I hope you can swim.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:15.100
<i>Hey, you"re gonna be all right.</i>

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.700
<i>You"re gonna be
all right.</i>

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.700
Come on.
Come on!

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.100
Come on, Margaret.

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.500
Come on.
Come on.

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.000
<i>Thank God.</i>

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:13.000
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.400
I don't think those
are so funny anymore.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.700
Well, I think she'd
be happy about that.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.400
Come on.
Let's go.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.900
<i>Okay, let's say good-bye
to Marcus and Donald.</i>

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.400
<i>Take care of Mommy, you hear?</i>

- Thanks a lot, Grace.
- Thank you.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.300
- Bye, Marcus.
- Bye.

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:12.000
<i>Mom, who will bring
our stuff to our new house?</i>

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:14.000
<i>That will be
the moving men.</i>

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.000
<i>It"ll be fun.</i>

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.600
Now, you ready?

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.600
Ready, James?

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.600
<i>James?
James!</i>
