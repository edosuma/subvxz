WEBVTT

00:14.016 --> 00:16.686
[Green] All right, here's
the plan. Triple-cuff him.

00:16.769 --> 00:19.522
Alpha team, you take point
positions in the convoy.

00:19.605 --> 00:21.816
Bravo team will bring up the rear.

00:21.899 --> 00:23.275
Remember, we're clear to engage,

00:23.358 --> 00:26.486
so if he so much as looks
at you funny, light him up.

00:26.571 --> 00:27.905
[officer 1] Copy that.

00:27.988 --> 00:30.825
You hear that, freak? I got
something special for you.

00:33.828 --> 00:35.788
This isn't necessary.

00:35.871 --> 00:38.332
Yeah, it is.

00:40.710 --> 00:42.461
[indistinct chatter]

00:45.923 --> 00:46.966
[groans]

00:47.049 --> 00:50.344
No. You need to let us
finish. Ms. Knight. Ms. Knight!

00:50.427 --> 00:53.430
It's Detective Knight, and I'm fine.

00:56.391 --> 00:58.018
I need a moment with Cage.

00:58.811 --> 01:00.479
[Green] Misty, we have special orders.

01:01.355 --> 01:02.898
Mario, come on.

01:03.816 --> 01:05.316
I was just held hostage.

01:06.235 --> 01:07.862
I just need a minute with him.

01:12.032 --> 01:14.869
All right. We'll be right
here. We got your back.

01:15.953 --> 01:17.204
[officer 2] Clear!

01:17.872 --> 01:19.414
You going down.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.251
It's about damn time.

01:23.252 --> 01:27.381
Cottonmouth, Officer Albini,
what just popped off in there...

01:29.174 --> 01:31.761
Look, your friend is in the wind.

01:34.764 --> 01:39.059
They've got public enemy number one in
handcuffs for the whole world to see...

01:39.769 --> 01:42.104
so they're not looking for anybody else.

01:43.898 --> 01:48.443
Every officer in your detail
has those modified Judas bullets.

01:48.527 --> 01:51.321
I wouldn't try anything if I were you...

01:52.657 --> 01:54.700
before I got to the precinct.

01:57.244 --> 01:59.538
You're not that crazy, are you?

02:01.331 --> 02:02.457
Always.

02:07.296 --> 02:09.006
Take his ass to jail.

02:10.841 --> 02:12.134
Come on.

02:17.347 --> 02:19.187
[officer 2] All right,
let's go. We're rolling.

02:22.519 --> 02:24.104
[sirens wailing]

02:29.860 --> 02:32.279
Three sets of cuffs?
Isn't that overkill?

02:32.362 --> 02:35.157
The camera's on. We need to
look like we're in control.

02:36.158 --> 02:38.285
[officer 1] It's a shit detail.

02:38.368 --> 02:41.371
You'd think ESU would be in the
back with those guns pointed at him.

02:41.455 --> 02:43.290
We've got the same guns
and bullets they do.

02:43.373 --> 02:45.668
You know, my wife says
it's the end of days,

02:45.751 --> 02:47.586
people like him popping up.

02:48.838 --> 02:51.506
They've been saying that
since Eve bit the apple.

02:51.590 --> 02:53.175
Cage? He's evolution.

02:53.258 --> 02:56.136
[stammers] Whatever
he is, it's just scary.

02:56.220 --> 02:58.723
Makes me feel small. Insignificant.

02:58.806 --> 03:00.640
Insecure?

03:00.725 --> 03:03.894
You know what they say. Once
you go black, you never go back.

03:03.978 --> 03:05.896
At least that's what your
wife keeps telling me.

03:05.980 --> 03:11.026
I was fast asleep when she came home.
Your daughter already wore me out.

03:11.110 --> 03:12.569
[officer 2] Just sit tight.

03:17.992 --> 03:19.243
God damn it.

03:19.326 --> 03:21.829
Homeless lady. Can't they
move her out of the way?

03:21.912 --> 03:24.224
[Green on loudspeaker] You are
in the path of a police convoy.

03:24.248 --> 03:25.916
Clear the road immediately.

03:27.292 --> 03:28.961
[tires screeching]

03:29.920 --> 03:30.963
[officer 3] Come on!

03:31.046 --> 03:33.758
[Green on loudspeaker] Cage
must not escape. Fire at will!

03:35.175 --> 03:36.468
[officer 3] Go, go, go, go, go!

03:37.887 --> 03:39.013
He went down the south side.

03:39.722 --> 03:42.307
[guns firing]

03:42.892 --> 03:45.310
[officers shouting indistinctly]

03:45.394 --> 03:47.538
[officer 4 on radio] <i>Somebody
give me a sitrep right now!</i>

03:47.562 --> 03:49.857
[officer 5] Team two...
Let's go, let's go!

03:51.316 --> 03:53.110
[officers shouting indistinctly]

04:10.460 --> 04:12.046
[sirens wailing]

04:14.757 --> 04:16.132
[shotgun cocks]

04:21.512 --> 04:23.640
Young cops always wanna chase somebody.

04:23.723 --> 04:26.143
Me, I'd rather be where
they're already going.

04:27.853 --> 04:30.773
They told us these Judas bullets
can kill someone like you.

04:30.856 --> 04:33.650
You don't want to die? Don't run.

04:33.733 --> 04:35.735
I'd rather die than go back to prison.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.822
[scoffs] Live free or die?

04:37.905 --> 04:39.715
You wanna get all New
Hampshire about this shit?

04:39.739 --> 04:41.075
Fine with me.

04:41.158 --> 04:44.578
- Cop killers don't survive these streets.
- I didn't kill a cop.

04:45.579 --> 04:48.290
My problem isn't with you or yours.

04:48.373 --> 04:50.000
It's much bigger than that.

04:50.084 --> 04:52.586
Some people are calling
you a hero for what you did.

04:52.669 --> 04:54.713
Connie's, Pop's...

04:55.214 --> 04:57.091
I'm no hero.

04:57.174 --> 05:00.135
But I do need to take out the
person responsible for all this.

05:01.428 --> 05:04.264
- You don't recognize me, do you?
- [sirens continue wailing]

05:08.477 --> 05:10.020
I've seen you at Pop's before.

05:11.063 --> 05:13.523
Pop cut my hair for 12 years.

05:13.607 --> 05:15.359
He didn't think he was a hero, either.

05:15.442 --> 05:18.112
He was just trying to do some
right after years of wrong.

05:22.950 --> 05:25.202
I hope I'm right about you.

05:26.703 --> 05:29.081
More people rooting
for you than you think.

05:30.124 --> 05:32.835
- What are you gonna tell your people?
- The truth.

05:32.918 --> 05:34.837
I had you in my sights,
but you outran me.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.338
I'm getting old.

05:38.924 --> 05:39.967
Luke?

05:40.634 --> 05:43.262
You better catch that
slippery son of a bitch.

05:54.148 --> 05:56.650

<font color="#ffff00">encoded by</font>
<font color="##2AAE22">eMRaN92@TUT</font>

07:06.178 --> 07:09.806
Moments after the tumultuous
events at Harlem's Paradise,

07:09.889 --> 07:15.479
<i>fugitive and alleged cop killer Luke
Cage was brought out in handcuffs.</i>

07:15.562 --> 07:17.064
<i>And now the city's most...</i>

07:17.147 --> 07:19.191
[Turk] Hey, I'm glad
you called me, Willis.

07:19.274 --> 07:22.444
Luke Cage is on the run.
They got Shades in bracelets,

07:22.527 --> 07:24.696
but they're gonna be onto
you before long, brother.

07:24.779 --> 07:26.573
Best believe that.

07:26.656 --> 07:29.659
Getting ghost and liquidizing
your cash, that was the right move.

07:29.743 --> 07:33.830
<i>- Luke Cage must be approached with...</i>
- [Stryker] I wouldn't touch any of that.

07:33.913 --> 07:34.914
[door opens]

07:36.416 --> 07:37.584
[door closes]

07:37.667 --> 07:40.212
People don't test me more than once.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.632
- I overstand.
- Hmm.

07:45.842 --> 07:47.677
What you need me for?

07:47.761 --> 07:51.556
I understand you're a man
of discretion and taste

07:51.640 --> 07:56.103
with numerous connections willing
to pay full price for my wares.

07:56.186 --> 07:58.438
I can still collect from the shadows.

07:58.522 --> 08:00.857
- Bad news, Diamondback.
- Take those off!

08:03.693 --> 08:06.863
I went to your crib. The
files you had are gone.

08:14.246 --> 08:15.539
[choking]

08:16.081 --> 08:17.624
[coughs]

08:17.707 --> 08:19.626
[continues choking]

08:25.132 --> 08:26.258
[laughs]

08:27.176 --> 08:29.428
- I had you, didn't I?
- [coughing]

08:29.511 --> 08:31.430
[Stryker continues laughing]

08:34.640 --> 08:36.184
I couldn't resist.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.938
I like you, Zip.

08:41.023 --> 08:44.068
You've got ambition.
It'll take you far...

08:44.150 --> 08:46.320
as long as you stay in your place.

08:46.945 --> 08:49.281
The first of the 48 laws of power.

08:50.407 --> 08:52.617
Never outshine the master.

08:53.618 --> 08:55.412
That was the mistake Shades made.

08:55.495 --> 08:58.707
He questioned me. He doubted
me. He tried to reach too far.

08:58.790 --> 09:01.585
He was on some Icarus shit.

09:04.046 --> 09:05.464
Do you know who that is?

09:06.756 --> 09:08.550
Yeah, he had a verse with Kendrick.

09:08.633 --> 09:11.053
- Right?
- No...

09:11.136 --> 09:15.140
Icarus was the boy who flew too
close to the sun with fake wings.

09:16.641 --> 09:19.018
Shades is no problem.
He's still in custody.

09:19.103 --> 09:20.562
Not for long.

09:21.980 --> 09:25.400
- You gonna blow the joint up?
- No, he's going to be bailed out.

09:26.526 --> 09:29.488
The hell for? That don't make no sense!

09:29.571 --> 09:31.823
See? The questioning.

09:32.574 --> 09:33.783
That's how it starts.

09:34.284 --> 09:35.327
[sighs]

09:43.127 --> 09:44.961
I'm gonna have an opening.

09:45.879 --> 09:47.964
You gonna step up?

09:48.047 --> 09:50.259
I'm down to do whatever you need.

09:51.426 --> 09:53.387
- No problem.
- [Stryker] Good boy.

09:54.429 --> 09:56.014
So are you down?

09:57.432 --> 09:58.808
I'm down.

09:58.892 --> 10:02.061
As long as the business is
business, I'm good with it.

10:02.146 --> 10:04.314
Till then, I'm out of here, man.

10:05.315 --> 10:06.900
Show Turk out, Zip.

10:14.158 --> 10:15.909
Romeo would roll over in his grave,

10:15.992 --> 10:18.828
the way you hop-skipping
with these cats nowadays.

10:18.912 --> 10:21.248
He was a man on these
streets. You's a boy.

10:21.331 --> 10:23.167
What the hell are you talking about?

10:23.250 --> 10:25.877
You're down here in
his pocket, same as me.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.796
I'm doing business with him, yes.

10:28.713 --> 10:32.634
But I ain't his boy. And I
definitely ain't his bitch.

10:43.353 --> 10:44.604
- [door slams]
- [Zip scoffs]

10:44.688 --> 10:47.941
These old-ass niggas talkin' about
shit they don't even know about.

10:48.024 --> 10:50.569
So... what's in the box?

10:51.486 --> 10:54.489
One of the seven deadly sins, my boy...

10:54.573 --> 10:57.534
which I plan to unleash
on dear old Carl.

10:57.617 --> 10:58.785
Which one?

11:00.537 --> 11:01.913
Wrath.

11:04.416 --> 11:08.044
[in Spanish] This Diamondback
needs to be dealt with.

11:08.628 --> 11:15.260
Ernesto is right, Domingo. This
is the perfect time to do it.

11:15.344 --> 11:17.637
We've got the muscle.

11:17.721 --> 11:24.143
Plus, with the Cuban, Jamaican,
Dominican and Haitian leaders dead,

11:24.228 --> 11:29.107
we can control the
drugs, guns, all of it...

11:29.858 --> 11:32.277
and walk out like kings.

11:33.445 --> 11:36.240
[in English] I was there
when he took them all out.

11:37.282 --> 11:38.617
Right next door.

11:40.452 --> 11:42.496
We got the drugs.

11:42.579 --> 11:44.456
We got that money.

11:44.539 --> 11:48.042
But with the guns, we
can control everything.

11:49.127 --> 11:51.255
Here, the islands, further south...

11:53.423 --> 11:56.260
We'd be unstoppable. Hmm?

11:56.343 --> 11:59.178
[Ernesto in Spanish]
So what are you saying?

12:01.556 --> 12:03.141
[in English] We take him out.

12:04.559 --> 12:06.270
We go after what's ours.

12:06.353 --> 12:08.522
[Ernesto scoffs and chuckles]

12:10.524 --> 12:12.191
Let's go find Diamondback.

12:14.903 --> 12:16.112
[sighs]

12:17.196 --> 12:19.991
- [camera shutter clicking]
- [officer 1] Turn and face the camera.

12:26.373 --> 12:27.973
[officer 2] All right,
let's go. Move it.

12:43.848 --> 12:46.393
You're supposed to be in the hospital.

12:48.019 --> 12:51.022
Push yourself too hard too soon and
you could make it worse, you know.

12:51.105 --> 12:53.567
- I appreciate your concern.
- No, you don't.

12:55.444 --> 12:57.612
I need you at 100%.

12:57.696 --> 13:00.490
I need to prove Luke Cage is innocent.

13:01.616 --> 13:03.410
Well, the hostages
have all been consistent

13:03.493 --> 13:05.173
that Luke Cage never
held them at gunpoint.

13:05.244 --> 13:07.706
[Misty] He was set up.
You know it, Priscilla.

13:07.789 --> 13:09.541
Half this damn department knows it.

13:10.542 --> 13:12.544
We need to be going
after Willis Stryker.

13:12.627 --> 13:14.671
Well, then why is Luke Cage running?

13:16.673 --> 13:19.926
He's a black man being
chased by the cops...

13:20.009 --> 13:21.511
oh, with special bullets.

13:23.638 --> 13:24.639
Accused of killing a cop,

13:24.723 --> 13:27.016
and you're asking why
he's running? Come on.

13:32.481 --> 13:35.984
Look at how relaxed
Hernan "Shades" Alvarez is.

13:36.067 --> 13:38.528
He knows he's not going
anywhere anytime soon,

13:38.612 --> 13:40.113
so he's resting up.

13:41.490 --> 13:42.949
He knows he's guilty.

13:51.458 --> 13:52.834
See this perp?

13:54.043 --> 13:57.964
Look how his foot is bouncing. Nervous.

13:58.047 --> 14:01.426
- No wonder his street name is Sugar.
- [chuckles]

14:01.510 --> 14:03.571
I don't even have to say a word,
and here come the waterworks.

14:03.595 --> 14:05.514
He's probably innocent...

14:06.431 --> 14:08.767
or less guilty than whoever
he's about to give up.

14:08.850 --> 14:10.268
That's a detectives' wives' tale.

14:10.351 --> 14:12.396
You can't prove guilt
or innocence by that.

14:12.479 --> 14:14.814
Oh, but you can...

14:14.898 --> 14:16.691
- because Luke gave you his word.
- Luke...

14:16.775 --> 14:19.528
Right now, his actions are
speaking louder than his words.

14:19.611 --> 14:20.987
Luke Cage...

14:21.905 --> 14:23.740
saved my life.

14:25.241 --> 14:28.161
I don't dispute that we should
be bringing in Diamondback,

14:28.244 --> 14:31.330
but to get to the truth, we
need to bring them both in.

14:32.999 --> 14:34.459
[indistinct chatter]

14:36.044 --> 14:40.465
Okay, well, let me lead the charge.
Make sure Luke is brought in safely.

14:40.549 --> 14:43.051
He threw away his chance when
he jumped out that damn van.

14:43.134 --> 14:46.137
Now they will shoot him on
sight with the mayor's blessing.

14:50.975 --> 14:54.187
You know what? At least let
me take a crack at Shades.

14:54.270 --> 14:56.565
He's in deep with all the players.

14:58.107 --> 14:59.401
He doesn't scare me.

14:59.484 --> 15:00.902
- Detective...
- I can handle him.

15:00.985 --> 15:02.654
You just got shot.

15:02.737 --> 15:05.364
- I need you to go home, get some rest.
- [sighs]

15:08.242 --> 15:09.536
I'll interview Shades.

15:21.047 --> 15:24.217
[Mariah] My grandmother
loved Harlem's Paradise.

15:27.721 --> 15:31.433
She took care of all the small details.

15:31.516 --> 15:32.976
She loved it.

15:36.354 --> 15:38.648
From the murals...

15:38.732 --> 15:41.860
the glasswork, all the way
down to the table linens.

15:42.944 --> 15:45.321
No fine point was overlooked.

15:47.240 --> 15:50.034
- [glass shattering]
- This was her legacy.

15:51.077 --> 15:55.749
My family's in tatters, and it's
all because of Diamondback. Shit!

15:56.750 --> 15:57.959
[stammers]

15:58.042 --> 15:59.919
Uh, I know, I know...

16:00.920 --> 16:02.839
[sighs] I need to get
out in front of this.

16:02.922 --> 16:08.302
Release a statement about Damon
Boone and how much I respected him.

16:08.386 --> 16:10.179
That is not what I was gonna say.

16:10.263 --> 16:13.141
Well, yeah, just... Please, no lectures.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.147
This is just a thing.

16:19.230 --> 16:24.193
Things can be rebuilt, and when you
do, you rebuild it as your legacy.

16:24.277 --> 16:25.779
Not just the clubs.

16:30.534 --> 16:32.827
I want to be a part of that.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.459
Here's what I think.

16:40.544 --> 16:43.505
Controlling the narrative is everything.
We can't have any loose threads.

16:43.588 --> 16:44.964
So anyone who might have overheard

16:45.048 --> 16:48.301
anything you said to
Diamondback or Shades in here...

16:48.384 --> 16:49.803
is a threat.

16:50.887 --> 16:52.597
You're absolutely correct.

16:53.765 --> 16:55.349
[chuckles]

16:55.433 --> 16:57.393
How may I be of service?

17:01.355 --> 17:04.651
I wouldn't want you to
do anything untoward.

17:05.652 --> 17:06.736
Never.

17:08.655 --> 17:09.864
Okay.

17:11.115 --> 17:12.784
[indistinct chatter]

17:36.975 --> 17:38.852
I don't have time for this.

17:39.978 --> 17:41.896
- [cash rustling]
- [man 1] Don't move.

17:41.980 --> 17:43.940
He'll blow your head
off. He's crazy like that.

17:44.023 --> 17:45.609
Don't try no shit.

17:50.029 --> 17:52.824
My bad, Meth. I grew
up on that Wu-Tang shit.

17:52.907 --> 17:55.368
- But you know how it is.
- [Method Man] Are you serious?

17:55.451 --> 17:58.162
Are you really trying to
have a conversation right now?

17:58.246 --> 18:00.432
I'm just tryin'... I'm just
sayin'... You're the man, yo.

18:00.456 --> 18:02.852
Pull your mask down! You supposed
to be watchin' the damn door, Bryce!

18:02.876 --> 18:05.003
What I say about using my
government name, Michael?

18:05.086 --> 18:06.337
[door chimes]

18:07.631 --> 18:09.483
Damn, homie. You look like you
went through a cheese grater.

18:09.507 --> 18:10.967
Oh, snap, you Luke...

18:11.050 --> 18:12.719
- [gun firing]
- [bullet ricocheting]

18:12.802 --> 18:15.221
- [glass shattering]
- [gasping]

18:18.600 --> 18:20.018
I ain't mean that.

18:23.855 --> 18:25.774
Give me your phone.

18:25.857 --> 18:27.025
The phone, fool.

18:27.859 --> 18:30.045
Yo, my bad, man. You know, I
just got a little nervous and shit

18:30.069 --> 18:32.697
- when you threw my mans across the...
- [grunts]

18:35.533 --> 18:36.660
It's you.

18:38.036 --> 18:40.747
- Yeah, it's you.
- [chuckles]

18:40.830 --> 18:42.331
No, man, it's you.

18:43.249 --> 18:46.210
Yo, man, "P.L.O. Style" was
my joint back in the day.

18:46.294 --> 18:48.797
Sweet Christmas. [chuckles]

18:49.422 --> 18:50.924
Yeah, man, one second.

18:55.094 --> 18:57.096
Hey. It's me.

18:58.306 --> 19:00.141
Yeah, they'll be looking for me.

19:00.850 --> 19:04.103
I'll lay in the cut.
I'll see you in a few.

19:09.483 --> 19:10.652
You a double XL?

19:10.735 --> 19:12.278
[scoffs] Way ahead of you, homie,

19:27.085 --> 19:28.544
Call the cops.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.981
I know a lot of people who would
pay you for this kind of protection.

19:31.005 --> 19:32.882
They can keep their money.

19:34.718 --> 19:35.760
Salute.

19:39.638 --> 19:41.432
[laughs]

19:41.515 --> 19:44.268
You ever see anything like that before?

19:44.352 --> 19:45.979
Harlem, baby.

19:46.855 --> 19:48.189
Harlem.

19:48.272 --> 19:49.733
[cell phone ringing]

19:50.692 --> 19:53.027
- Hello?
- [Candace] <i>Detective Knight?</i>

19:54.070 --> 19:55.654
- Candace?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

19:55.739 --> 19:57.741
<i>What number are you calling me from?</i>

19:57.824 --> 20:00.576
A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS.

20:00.659 --> 20:02.078
I need to see you.

20:02.161 --> 20:05.248
- Come into the precinct.
<i>- No. No.</i>

20:05.331 --> 20:08.918
You saw how quickly Mariah sent
that lawyer and got me out of there.

20:10.211 --> 20:13.297
You didn't wanna talk to me
before. What makes you trust me now?

20:13.381 --> 20:15.216
<i>Because Luke Cage does.</i>

20:15.800 --> 20:19.345
He saved my life. And
you saw right through me.

20:21.597 --> 20:24.726
<i>- You want the truth, right?</i>
- Where are you?

20:24.809 --> 20:26.853
<i>- Look, if you can't help...</i>
- Candace.

20:26.936 --> 20:29.438
<i>Tell me a place, and I will be there.</i>

20:34.402 --> 20:37.488
[Ridley] You should be at Rikers
right now, but I held you...

20:38.406 --> 20:41.242
because I think you
have something to say.

20:42.535 --> 20:43.787
Lawyer.

20:44.954 --> 20:47.832
[chuckles] I know your
record, Mr. Alvarez.

20:48.833 --> 20:51.961
Came up in Harlem, rolled around
with Cottonmouth in the late '90s,

20:52.045 --> 20:54.047
spent some time at Spofford, Sing Sing,

20:54.130 --> 20:56.841
then you made it to the
big time, went to Seagate.

20:57.842 --> 20:59.052
[sighs]

21:01.220 --> 21:02.638
Lawyer.

21:02.721 --> 21:06.100
Cornell Stokes is dead,
but you're still alive.

21:07.101 --> 21:09.728
And I've never seen an
arraignment happen so quickly.

21:09.813 --> 21:11.773
Two million dollar bail...

21:11.856 --> 21:14.275
and someone paid it in cash.

21:14.358 --> 21:17.611
Who's your new sponsor?
Is it Willis Stryker?

21:18.696 --> 21:19.781
Law...

21:20.698 --> 21:21.825
yer.

21:23.326 --> 21:26.579
You were part of a
hostage situation, Hernan.

21:28.122 --> 21:30.541
Even if your lawyer does get you out...

21:31.918 --> 21:34.045
you won't be walking away from that.

21:35.088 --> 21:37.590
That's multiple kidnapping
and weapons charges.

21:37.673 --> 21:41.302
How does 25 years to life
sound to you? Minimum.

21:42.220 --> 21:43.387
Are you serious?

21:44.889 --> 21:46.099
Yep.

21:50.103 --> 21:51.354
Okay.

21:52.605 --> 21:53.857
[scoffs]

21:55.149 --> 21:56.275
Okay.

21:57.443 --> 21:58.486
[scoffs]

21:59.528 --> 22:01.447
I... I was in the club.

22:01.530 --> 22:02.698
[clears throat]

22:03.741 --> 22:05.368
I saw what happened.

22:07.036 --> 22:08.662
I know who did it.

22:09.956 --> 22:12.541
- Okay.
- [inhales deeply]

22:12.625 --> 22:16.462
We can protect you, but
I need a name to verify.

22:17.380 --> 22:18.589
Who was it?

22:22.051 --> 22:23.761
Was it Stryker?

22:28.516 --> 22:29.976
He goes by...

22:32.728 --> 22:33.938
lawyer.

22:37.150 --> 22:38.484
You need me to spell it?

22:39.610 --> 22:40.861
[laughing]

22:43.364 --> 22:44.490
[door slams]

22:57.211 --> 23:00.798
- You call this safe?
- We're hiding in plain sight.

23:00.881 --> 23:04.052
I've got you. For now.

23:04.135 --> 23:07.471
Lie to me again, Candace, I walk away
from here, and you are on your own.

23:07.555 --> 23:09.807
- It's not bullshit.
- We'll see.

23:11.475 --> 23:14.270
How did you even get out of Harlem's
Paradise without being stopped?

23:14.353 --> 23:18.024
They were so busy trying to
arrest Luke, I just walked away.

23:20.944 --> 23:22.736
So what is it?

23:22.820 --> 23:24.700
What do you need to tell
me that's so important?

23:24.738 --> 23:25.949
[sighs]

23:28.367 --> 23:30.911
I was at the club the
night Cottonmouth died.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.789
I already know that.

23:35.208 --> 23:36.584
I mean right after.

23:44.258 --> 23:45.801
[sighs]

23:56.145 --> 23:57.188
[beeps]

24:01.025 --> 24:02.651
Mariah killed him.

24:03.611 --> 24:06.405
[Shades] The trash bag is for
the clothes you're wearing now.

24:06.489 --> 24:09.617
Every stitch goes in. Jewelry, too.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.995
Someone from Spurlock's
will incinerate them.

24:13.037 --> 24:17.291
The secret to any good lie is it
has to run parallel to the truth.

24:18.334 --> 24:20.294
[Misty] <i>How do you know this?</i>

24:20.378 --> 24:22.421
[Candace] <i>I heard them talking about it.</i>

24:22.505 --> 24:23.672
[Shades] Do what I say.

24:23.756 --> 24:26.759
[Candace] <i>The guy who always</i>
<i>wears sunglasses, he was there.</i>

24:29.720 --> 24:32.681
<i>It was his idea to say Luke
Cage killed Cottonmouth.</i>

24:38.104 --> 24:39.147
[grunts]

24:42.191 --> 24:43.901
I was so scared.

24:43.984 --> 24:46.362
I snuck out of there,
back to the lockers.

24:46.445 --> 24:49.282
And, um, I was trying
to calm myself down.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.868
When I went upstairs,
the guy with the glasses

24:52.951 --> 24:55.579
offered me $50,000 to tell a story.

24:57.748 --> 24:58.957
So I told one.

25:00.459 --> 25:03.754
- Why are you coming clean now?
- 'Cause I can't live with this.

25:04.713 --> 25:07.091
Especially after Luke saving my life.

25:09.052 --> 25:11.054
If you can guarantee my safety,

25:11.137 --> 25:14.223
I will testify about
everything I just told you.

25:17.351 --> 25:18.477
[phone beeps]

25:23.107 --> 25:25.984
Mariah scares me more than Cottonmouth.

25:27.195 --> 25:32.533
I asked her if she thought Luke did
it, mostly to see if I could trust her.

25:32.616 --> 25:35.035
To see if she would tell me the truth.

25:39.957 --> 25:42.793
She looked me right
in my eye and said...

25:44.420 --> 25:47.423
"You never know what
anyone is capable of."

25:48.841 --> 25:51.427
[breath trembling] It
was the way she said it.

25:52.803 --> 25:55.598
She... she would kill me if
she knew I was speaking to you.

25:55.681 --> 25:57.391
I truly believe that.

25:59.477 --> 26:01.061
Thank you for helping me.

26:03.481 --> 26:07.110
I'm gonna nail Mariah
Dillard's ass to the wall.

26:11.530 --> 26:14.200
- Who else knows that you're here?
- Just my friend Leslie.

26:14.283 --> 26:17.828
Don't call anyone else, not even Leslie.

26:19.163 --> 26:20.763
As a matter of fact, give me your phone.

26:22.125 --> 26:23.376
Come on.

26:25.419 --> 26:31.342
Okay. Now, I picked this
up... on the way, just in case.

26:32.885 --> 26:34.845
It's already got my
number programed in there,

26:34.928 --> 26:37.556
so if I call or text, you know it's me.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.853
Is your arm okay?

26:42.936 --> 26:45.689
[sighs] My trigger finger is just fine.

26:47.775 --> 26:49.693
Come on, let's go.

26:49.777 --> 26:51.862
- Where?
- Soledad's.

26:51.945 --> 26:53.281
Her daughter Claire

26:53.364 --> 26:55.741
is the one who treated your
ankle at Harlem's Paradise.

26:55.824 --> 26:56.992
She'll be there, too.

26:57.993 --> 26:59.828
I'm gonna take you there myself.

27:14.802 --> 27:17.388
[Method Man] No lie. Bullets
was flying everywhere and shit.

27:17.471 --> 27:22.268
You trying to tell me that
those are bullet holes?

27:22.351 --> 27:24.937
Man, Meth, I love you,
but get out of here.

27:25.020 --> 27:26.272
I... I don't believe that.

27:26.355 --> 27:29.024
HB, I thought the same thing...

27:29.107 --> 27:33.404
until shorty pulled the
biscuit and let two off on Cage

27:33.487 --> 27:35.030
and they bounced off.

27:35.113 --> 27:36.699
Bullets ricochetin' and shit.

27:36.782 --> 27:38.542
[stammers] Look, I'm
telling y'all the truth.

27:38.576 --> 27:40.345
I see y'all over there,
y'all don't believe it.

27:40.369 --> 27:41.412
Trust me, it's the truth.

27:41.495 --> 27:44.332
[stutters] And after he
smacked fire out these dudes,

27:44.415 --> 27:47.918
he left the hoodie, told me
and Gomez to call the police.

27:48.001 --> 27:50.296
You know I ain't calling
no po-po. Then he bounced.

27:50.379 --> 27:52.756
- Say word.
- Word, Sway. I'm telling you.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.343
He even balled the dude's
gun up like some old homework.

27:56.385 --> 27:59.930
But my thing is, though, if he
innocent, so what he running for?

28:00.848 --> 28:03.183
Bulletproof always gonna
come second to being black.

28:03.267 --> 28:06.019
HB, you should know
that. You from Jers. Jers!

28:06.103 --> 28:08.314
Wow! Sound like he
stunted on you right there.

28:08.397 --> 28:10.083
He did stunt. It was a
stunt. It was a stunt.

28:10.107 --> 28:11.775
- Why you gotta stunt on me?
- [laughs]

28:11.859 --> 28:12.901
No, I mean, seriously.

28:12.985 --> 28:16.405
Seriously, though, what I'm just
saying, like, if that was me...

28:16.489 --> 28:18.407
- [Heather B] Right.
- And I was on the run.

28:19.450 --> 28:21.118
- Why even get involved?
- [Sway] Hmm.

28:21.201 --> 28:22.245
But he did.

28:22.995 --> 28:26.790
And those dudes was nervous,
so anything could've happened.

28:26.874 --> 28:29.752
As far as I'm concerned,
Luke Cage saved my life, man.

28:29.835 --> 28:31.504
That's what's up, man.

28:31.587 --> 28:34.507
You know what, that don't
sound like no cop killer to me.

28:34.590 --> 28:36.133
For real, for real.

28:36.216 --> 28:41.305
You know, there's somethin'
powerful about seeing a black man

28:41.389 --> 28:44.099
that's bulletproof and unafraid.

28:44.182 --> 28:46.143
- Come on, y'all. You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

28:46.227 --> 28:47.787
[Method Man] Streets
got mad love for Cage.

28:47.811 --> 28:51.064
I got mad love for Cage, man,
and... and he one of ours.

28:51.148 --> 28:52.900
Yeah, yeah. But you know what?

28:52.983 --> 28:54.693
We got mad love for you, too.

28:54.777 --> 28:56.404
- No doubt.
- You one of ours, man.

28:56.487 --> 28:58.882
You know, the show's almost
over, man. You gonna spit for us?

28:58.906 --> 29:01.575

The homie, Method Man, HB, and

31:04.907 --> 31:07.868
Law enforcement is in a
frenzy looking for Luke Cage.

31:07.951 --> 31:09.828
There have been
numerous false sightings,

31:09.912 --> 31:12.706
with some people wearing
hoodies with holes

31:12.790 --> 31:18.462

I understand playing against the computer,
but, um, how do you beat yourself?

32:09.346 --> 32:11.181
Chess is a game of anticipation.

32:14.392 --> 32:16.144
If you know every single possible move,

32:16.228 --> 32:20.023
you can anticipate your adversary's
next move before he does.

32:20.107 --> 32:21.149
Oh.

32:22.067 --> 32:23.110
That's deep.

him, there'll be hell to pay.

No, she's got her hands full already.

had to change things up.

You stopped playing your
position. Asked too many questions.

needed to be dealt with.

She left with Detective Knight.

I'm sorry. I'm not used to
doing anything like this.

40:17.167 --> 40:18.418
We'll find her again.

I wasn't particularly fond of Shades...

41:26.694 --> 41:31.074
and the death of Damon
Boone, although unnecessary,

41:31.158 --> 41:32.950
was appreciated.

41:35.203 --> 41:39.291
But you need to know this.
I'm out of the political game.

41:40.292 --> 41:43.878
I'm focusing on Harlem's
Paradise. Using it for a...

41:45.005 --> 41:48.633
a power base for community relations.

41:48.716 --> 41:51.386
That's a smart move.

41:51.469 --> 41:53.263
But you've made some dumb ones also.

41:53.346 --> 41:57.017
You should never talk about
murder on an open line.

42:03.606 --> 42:04.857
Open it.

Seed money... for your New
Harlem Renaissance project

I don't know... [screaming]

44:12.485 --> 44:13.778
What the... [yelps]

44:16.614 --> 44:18.115
- Hey!
- You still stalling?

44:20.493 --> 44:22.078
[Turk whimpering]

44:23.246 --> 44:24.706
All right! All right!

44:24.789 --> 44:27.209
He's at a warehouse by the Harlem River.

44:27.292 --> 44:29.126
Near 145th, all right?

44:30.962 --> 44:34.757
I gave you what you
wanted! Now let me out!

44:34.841 --> 44:36.968
Sit tight, Mr. Barrett.

44:37.051 --> 44:38.970
Trash pickup is tomorrow.

44:39.053 --> 44:42.474
You can breathe just fine.
There's food in there, too.

44:43.891 --> 44:45.893
[banging]

44:45.977 --> 44:48.313
You can't leave me in here!

44:48.396 --> 44:51.107
There's baby diapers in here, man!

44:52.024 --> 44:53.067
Hey!

44:53.985 --> 44:56.153
Come on!

44:56.238 --> 44:57.614
[door opening]

45:04.120 --> 45:05.372
[door slams]

45:23.348 --> 45:25.308
[Domingo] Looks like you downgraded.

45:26.268 --> 45:28.060
I liked the club better.

45:29.312 --> 45:31.648
I'm a man who needs his space.

45:33.275 --> 45:35.192
Space is a good thing.

45:36.193 --> 45:38.464
- Especially when you come to kill a man.
- [guns cocking]

45:38.488 --> 45:39.656
Whoa, whoa.

45:43.660 --> 45:45.077
[guns cocking]

45:50.667 --> 45:53.085
Someone did your boy
Zip and his two homies.

45:53.169 --> 45:55.672
That's not Cage's style...

45:55.755 --> 45:59.091
so I'm guessing Shades didn't
appreciate you bailing him out.

46:05.848 --> 46:10.520
You know when a rattlesnake is
at its most dangerous, Domingo?

46:13.230 --> 46:14.399
When it's cornered.

46:41.676 --> 46:43.428
I'm gonna rip your head off!

46:47.974 --> 46:49.183
[groans]

47:05.367 --> 47:06.826
[gunshots continue]

47:11.330 --> 47:14.041
- [whirring]
- [chuckles]

47:17.420 --> 47:19.547
"And behold a pale horse...

47:20.507 --> 47:24.469
and he that sat upon
him, his name was Death."

47:33.811 --> 47:35.104
[exhales]

47:35.187 --> 47:36.313
[sniffs]

48:13.017 --> 48:15.061
You really need a security system.

48:17.063 --> 48:20.066
- You waiting for me?
- No.

48:21.651 --> 48:23.903
I bet he told you I was dead.

48:26.489 --> 48:28.199
Diamondback got to you, didn't he?

48:28.282 --> 48:30.409
No, he didn't.

48:31.202 --> 48:32.454
[scoffs]

48:35.457 --> 48:38.209
What are you doing with
a gun? It's not you.

48:38.292 --> 48:39.544
Shut up.

48:41.713 --> 48:42.880
[sighs]

48:44.048 --> 48:45.800
I have something for you.

48:51.055 --> 48:52.389
Figured...

48:55.560 --> 48:57.269
you'd want this.

49:01.440 --> 49:04.694
Your prints... Cornell's blood.

49:12.368 --> 49:14.871
Then you'll have nothing
to blackmail me with.

49:16.038 --> 49:17.206
I don't need it.

49:18.165 --> 49:19.876
We're in this together now.

49:22.962 --> 49:24.046
[bottle thuds]

49:26.048 --> 49:28.134
You and I have come a long way.

49:29.636 --> 49:34.348
You know, sometimes you have to reach
across the aisle to get things done.

49:36.433 --> 49:38.394
You're talking about Luke Cage?

49:39.646 --> 49:43.315
It's incredible... how
much you and I think alike.

49:45.610 --> 49:46.819
We're at war.

49:47.779 --> 49:51.824
And right now, the enemy
of my enemy is my friend.

49:53.660 --> 49:56.579
Maybe. But it might not take.

49:57.580 --> 50:00.166
You did beat his ass
and give him his powers.

50:00.249 --> 50:01.876
- Mmm-hmm.
- And...

50:01.959 --> 50:06.172
Cornell's flunky killed Pop. You
think he really is gonna jump?

50:06.255 --> 50:07.757
Just jump on our bandwagon?

50:07.840 --> 50:09.801
Absolutely.

50:09.884 --> 50:13.304
'Cause we have something that
he wants more than anything.

50:16.891 --> 50:17.975
His old life.

50:18.810 --> 50:21.979
A chance to clear his name. Right here.

50:25.567 --> 50:29.904
If we send Luke after Diamondback
and they kill each other...

50:30.947 --> 50:32.740
all of our problems are swept away.

50:32.824 --> 50:34.533
- [exhales]
- No matter who wins.

50:34.617 --> 50:37.411
[chuckles] Even better.

51:35.177 --> 51:36.721
[Domingo groaning]

51:42.476 --> 51:44.771
I should've known you'd
turn up. [breathing heavily]

51:45.897 --> 51:47.649
What the hell happened here?

51:49.358 --> 51:51.068
Diamondback.

51:51.152 --> 51:52.444
[groaning]

51:52.528 --> 51:54.864
[faint beeping in distance]

52:07.418 --> 52:09.211
[beeping continues]

52:22.809 --> 52:24.894
Sweet sister.

52:24.977 --> 52:26.688
[beeping continues]

52:43.537 --> 52:45.915
[Luke panting] Slow.

52:47.541 --> 52:48.710
Take it easy.

52:51.170 --> 52:52.880
What did he use?

52:52.964 --> 52:55.049
How did Diamondback do that?

52:56.592 --> 52:58.886
[breathing heavily] Something
I've never seen before.

52:58.970 --> 53:00.972
[siren wailing in the distance]

53:01.055 --> 53:03.140
Even you can't stop him.

53:05.517 --> 53:07.353
[exhales softly]

53:19.824 --> 53:21.242
These just came in.

53:22.284 --> 53:25.496
- [sighs] Elephant punches all over again.
- Mmm-hmm.

53:25.579 --> 53:26.705
That's gotta be Cage, right?

53:26.789 --> 53:28.540
[cell phone ringing]

53:34.130 --> 53:36.340
- Hello?
- [Luke] <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

53:36.423 --> 53:39.010
<i>You guys find Domingo?</i>

53:39.093 --> 53:40.928
- Yeah.
<i>- Meet me.</i>

53:41.012 --> 53:42.221
Where?

54:06.620 --> 54:08.497
Should I thank you for this?

54:09.498 --> 54:11.625
All credit goes to Diamondback.

54:11.708 --> 54:14.378
I don't suppose we'll find his body.

54:14.461 --> 54:17.673
We found Zip's, though, and two
other thugs in an old building.

54:17.756 --> 54:20.509
Shot up. Right after they
picked up your other boy.

54:21.552 --> 54:22.761
Shades.

54:24.471 --> 54:26.682
Don't you ever get tired
of people getting out?

54:27.599 --> 54:28.684
Yes.

54:30.561 --> 54:34.648
Look, it's not safe for you to be
here. If you don't find Diamondback...

54:34.731 --> 54:37.609
Then he wins, and my life
is forever a living hell.

54:40.279 --> 54:41.864
Is there anything I can do?

54:42.781 --> 54:44.450
See what else Turk knows.

54:44.533 --> 54:46.994
He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd.

54:47.078 --> 54:49.288
Near Mount Olivet and the shop.

54:50.789 --> 54:52.166
A Dumpster?

54:58.297 --> 54:59.340
[sighs]

55:06.848 --> 55:09.516
Even if we handle Diamondback...

55:09.600 --> 55:13.104
he's not gonna forgive us for
framing him for Cornell's death.

55:14.021 --> 55:15.731
We could hurdle that easy.

55:16.815 --> 55:19.193
The only people who know what
really happened in the club

55:19.276 --> 55:21.070
are you and me.

55:24.031 --> 55:26.909
I'll regret that night
for the rest of my life.

55:28.035 --> 55:29.495
You did what you had to do.

55:29.578 --> 55:31.622
You shouldn't regret that.

55:34.208 --> 55:37.253
What were you even doing
at the club that night?

55:42.091 --> 55:44.218
I was going there to kill him.

55:46.095 --> 55:47.679
You beat me to it.

55:53.269 --> 55:55.354
Cornell never needed my political money.

55:56.272 --> 55:58.607
And he was never going to pay it back.

56:00.526 --> 56:04.613
He just wanted me in all the way.

56:05.907 --> 56:07.074
So what are you saying?

56:11.870 --> 56:16.167
He saw things in me... that
I avoided my whole life.

56:19.461 --> 56:24.175
Now I am becoming that
person he always saw...

56:27.219 --> 56:28.845
and I always denied.

56:33.725 --> 56:35.061
You ready?

56:36.853 --> 56:38.564
I stay ready, baby.

57:03.880 --> 57:06.675
I should've kept my coat
on. Hell just froze over.

57:06.758 --> 57:07.801
[door closes]

57:07.884 --> 57:10.972
- Where's Luke Cage?
- I'm right here.

57:12.974 --> 57:14.600
- We have a problem.
- So do I.

57:14.683 --> 57:17.937
I can't decide which one of
you I'm gonna knock out first.

57:18.020 --> 57:20.814
- Where's Diamondback?
- I don't know.

57:20.897 --> 57:24.026
The parley between the three
of us is more important.

57:24.110 --> 57:26.112
You have the nerve to use that term?

57:26.195 --> 57:28.322
Right here? Where Pop died?

57:29.240 --> 57:30.950
Cough up Diamondback's location,

57:31.033 --> 57:33.160
or I'll stomp you like
we were back at Seagate.

57:33.244 --> 57:34.870
Luke, be cool, brother.

57:34.954 --> 57:38.207
Whoa, whoa. No one
needs to stomp anyone.

57:38.290 --> 57:41.085
Pops made this place
Switzerland for a reason.

57:41.168 --> 57:43.504
Cage, we have a mutual enemy,

57:43.587 --> 57:46.632
and the only way to bring him down
is for us all to come together.

57:46.715 --> 57:48.842
There's no way I'm helping you.

57:48.925 --> 57:51.512
We came to offer you a truce.

57:51.595 --> 57:54.765
In exchange for helping
you find Diamondback,

57:54.848 --> 57:56.350
you drop your beef with us.

57:56.433 --> 57:58.560
You both framed me for murder.

57:58.644 --> 58:01.397
There's nothing you can offer me
that's going to make me let that go.

58:01.480 --> 58:04.525
Uh... how about your freedom?

58:05.734 --> 58:08.862
Right here is everything you need

58:08.945 --> 58:11.907
to prove that Diamondback
framed Carl Lucas.

58:22.126 --> 58:25.046
Even if Carl Lucas is exonerated...

58:25.129 --> 58:28.049
Luke Cage is now wanted for
the murder of Cottonmouth.

58:28.132 --> 58:29.966
I'll tell them the truth.

58:30.051 --> 58:33.429
Diamondback killed
Cornell and Damon Boone.

58:33.512 --> 58:35.056
You'll go free.

58:37.433 --> 58:38.934
What the hell is this?

58:39.018 --> 58:42.646
Mariah Dillard, you're under arrest
for the murder of Cornell Stokes.

58:42.729 --> 58:44.416
I thought you said you
were going after Turk?

58:44.440 --> 58:46.126
[Misty] I've been tracking
you since you called.

58:46.150 --> 58:48.444
I wasn't going to let
you just ghost me again.

58:48.527 --> 58:52.156
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Shades, back off!

58:52.239 --> 58:55.034
Misty, stand down.
We're working this out.

58:55.117 --> 58:56.785
Oh, so you workin' with them now?

58:56.868 --> 58:59.580
- He knows where Diamondback is.
- I didn't say that.

58:59.663 --> 59:03.125
Well, whatever you know, Hernan, you
should share it with the whole class.

59:03.209 --> 59:05.086
I ain't telling you shit.

59:08.089 --> 59:09.173
Grenade!

59:10.091 --> 59:11.217
[screaming]

59:15.846 --> 59:17.764
[car alarm blaring in distance]

59:17.848 --> 59:19.183
[Mariah coughs]

59:24.271 --> 59:25.397
What the hell?

59:25.481 --> 59:27.399
What type of Jean Paul
Gaultier shit is this?

59:27.483 --> 59:29.068
What are you, a pimp stormtrooper?

59:29.151 --> 59:31.278
No, I'm the angel of death.

59:31.362 --> 59:33.280
- You told him to meet us here?
- No.

59:33.364 --> 59:36.325
Damn! Look at Hernan the cockroach.

59:36.408 --> 59:38.285
Your mama should have named you Pedro.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.621
Shades!

59:40.704 --> 59:42.164
[bullets ricocheting]

59:48.087 --> 59:49.421
[Bobby] God damn it!

59:49.505 --> 59:52.716
I just fixed this place
up all perfect and shit!

59:52.799 --> 59:54.176
Y'all can't take this outside?

59:54.260 --> 59:56.095
- No.
- No!

59:56.178 --> 59:58.013
All right, just... just sayin'.

59:58.805 --> 01:00:01.600
- Don't let Mariah get away.
- I won't.

01:00:01.683 --> 01:00:03.519
Kick his ass, Luke.

01:00:06.688 --> 01:00:09.108
You know I'm gonna kill
'em all later, right?

01:00:09.191 --> 01:00:11.610
You have to get past me first.

01:00:11.693 --> 01:00:14.029
Oh, I don't go past.

01:00:14.113 --> 01:00:15.489
I go through.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.491
[both yelling]

01:00:19.486 --> 01:00:21.488
