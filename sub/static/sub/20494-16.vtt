05:05.999 --> 05:06.999
Lemonis: IT JUST MEANS

05:05.999 --> 05:06.999
HE'S MAKING IT UP.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
Anthony: NO! NO, NO, NO.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
I'VE HAD THAT.

05:08.999 --> 05:09.999
Lemonis:

05:08.999 --> 05:09.999
YOU'RE TOTALLY MAKING THAT UP.

05:09.999 --> 05:11.999
Kristen: I'VE NEVER HEARD

05:09.999 --> 05:11.999
YOU SAY THAT, EVER.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
Josh: IT'S ALWAYS BEEN

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
"ASIL" TO ME.

05:13.999 --> 05:15.999
Lemonis: [ CHUCKLES ]

05:15.999 --> 05:16.999
-Kristen: ASIL.

05:15.999 --> 05:16.999
-Anthony: ASIL.

05:16.999 --> 05:18.999
-Kristen: [ LAUGHS ]

05:16.999 --> 05:18.999
-Lemonis: WHO MADE THE LOGO?

05:18.999 --> 05:19.999
-Kristen: JOSH.

05:18.999 --> 05:19.999
-Anthony: JOSH.

05:19.999 --> 05:20.999
Josh: IT WAS SUPPOSED

05:19.999 --> 05:20.999
TO BE A JOKE.

05:20.999 --> 05:21.999
Kristen: [ LAUGHS ]

05:21.999 --> 05:23.999
Anthony: WELL, JOKE'S ON HIM

05:21.999 --> 05:23.999
BECAUSE NOW I'M USING IT.

05:23.999 --> 05:25.999
Josh: NOW IT'S EVERYWHERE.

05:25.999 --> 05:27.999
Lemonis: AND SO, WHAT HAPPENS

05:25.999 --> 05:27.999
WHEN YOU GET MARRIED?

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
DOES THE SIGN-COMPANY NAME

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
CHANGE OR...?

05:29.999 --> 05:30.999
Anthony: [ SIGHS ]

05:29.999 --> 05:30.999
IF SHE WANTS.

05:30.999 --> 05:32.999
Kristen:

05:30.999 --> 05:32.999
I DON'T NEED MY FACE ON THERE.

05:32.999 --> 05:33.999
Lemonis: YOU DON'T NEED

05:32.999 --> 05:33.999
TO BE DOING THIS?

05:33.999 --> 05:35.999
Kristen: HE CAN KEEP THAT.

05:35.999 --> 05:37.999
Lemonis: BUILDING A BRAND IN ANY

05:35.999 --> 05:37.999
BUSINESS IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS.

05:37.999 --> 05:41.999
AND BUILDING THAT BRAND AROUND

05:37.999 --> 05:41.999
THE OWNER IS NOT A BAD IDEA,

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
AS LONG AS THE OWNER

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
IS LIKEABLE AND RELATABLE.

05:43.999 --> 05:44.999
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU,

05:43.999 --> 05:44.999
BY THE WAY.

05:44.999 --> 05:46.000
Josh: HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:46.999 --> 05:47.999
-Lemonis: I'M MARCUS.

05:46.999 --> 05:47.999
-Josh: JOSHUA THOMAS.

05:47.999 --> 05:48.999
Lemonis: SO,

05:47.999 --> 05:48.999
YOU DO THE DESIGNS HERE?

05:48.999 --> 05:53.999
Josh: I DO ALL THE DESIGN WORK,

05:48.999 --> 05:53.999
RUN THE MACHINERY,

05:53.999 --> 05:54.999
I DO ALL THE PRODUCTION

05:53.999 --> 05:54.999
RENDERINGS.

05:54.999 --> 05:56.999
Lemonis: AND DO YOU DO SOME

05:54.999 --> 05:56.999
OF THE DESIGN YOURSELF AS WELL?

05:56.999 --> 05:57.999
Kristen: YES.

05:57.999 --> 05:59.999
-Lemonis: AND DOES HE?

05:57.999 --> 05:59.999
-Kristen: HE TRIES TO.

05:59.999 --> 06:00.999
Lemonis:

05:59.999 --> 06:00.999
SHE'S DOING ALL THE WORK?

06:00.999 --> 06:01.999
Anthony: ALL THE WORK.

06:00.999 --> 06:01.999
EVERY LITTLE BIT OF IT.

06:01.999 --> 06:04.999
-SHE'S DOING EVERYTHING.

06:01.999 --> 06:04.999
-Lemonis: WHAT'S MR. ASL DO?

06:04.999 --> 06:05.999
Josh:

06:04.999 --> 06:05.999
WE LIKE TO KEEP HIM OUTSIDE.

06:07.999 --> 06:08.999
Lemonis: SELLING.

06:08.999 --> 06:09.999
Josh: NO, NOT SELLING.

06:08.999 --> 06:09.999
LIKE, INSTALLATIONS.

06:09.999 --> 06:11.999
Kristen:

06:09.999 --> 06:11.999
JUST DOING THE WORK.

06:11.999 --> 06:13.999
Lemonis: WHY DID EVERYBODY

06:11.999 --> 06:13.999
SAY NO TO YOU SELLING?

06:13.999 --> 06:15.999
Josh: I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE

06:13.999 --> 06:15.999
SEE HIM AS BEING OVERBEARING.

06:15.999 --> 06:16.999
-Kristen: YEAH.

06:15.999 --> 06:16.999
-Anthony: TOO MUCH?

06:16.999 --> 06:17.999
-Kristen: HE'S OVERWHELMING.

06:16.999 --> 06:17.999
-Anthony: I AM NOT.

06:17.999 --> 06:18.999
Josh:

06:17.999 --> 06:18.999
HE'S A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR.

06:18.999 --> 06:19.999
Kristen: HE'S LOUD.

06:19.999 --> 06:21.999
Lemonis: SO WHO DOES SALES

06:19.999 --> 06:21.999
AROUND HERE?

06:21.999 --> 06:22.999
-Anthony: US THREE.

06:21.999 --> 06:22.999
-Josh: YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
Lemonis: THEY'RE

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
KIND OF NOT INCLUDING YOU

06:24.999 --> 06:25.999
IN THAT SALES LOOP.

06:25.999 --> 06:28.000
Kristen: THE TWO OF US

06:25.999 --> 06:28.000
ARE ALWAYS IN THE OFFICE.

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
MOST OF THE TIME,

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
HE'S NOT IN THE OFFICE.

06:30.999 --> 06:31.999
Anthony:

06:30.999 --> 06:31.999
WE HAVE A COUPLE SALESMEN,

06:31.999 --> 06:33.999
AND THIS CREW RIGHT HERE

06:31.999 --> 06:33.999
THAT I HAVE IS PHENOMENAL.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.999
Lemonis:

06:33.999 --> 06:35.999
THEN HOW DO YOU GUYS GET PAID?

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
YOU GET A SALARY

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
OUT OF THE BUSINESS?

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
Anthony: YEAH, I JUST STARTED

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
TAKING A SALARY

06:39.999 --> 06:41.000
MAYBE A MONTH AGO,

06:39.999 --> 06:41.000
TWO MONTHS AGO,

06:41.999 --> 06:42.999
NOW THAT BANK ACCOUNT'S

06:41.999 --> 06:42.999
STARTING TO FILL UP.

06:42.999 --> 06:44.999
-AND ME AND HER --

06:42.999 --> 06:44.999
-Kristen: I DON'T GET PAID.

06:44.999 --> 06:47.000
Anthony: WELL, SHE GETS PAID

06:44.999 --> 06:47.000
THROUGH MY SALARY.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
IF SHE NEEDS MONEY,

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
I GIVE IT TO HER.

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
Lemonis: UH, LET ME SEE

06:49.999 --> 06:51.999
IF I UNDERSTAND THAT AGAIN.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
SHE DOESN'T GET PAID.

06:53.999 --> 06:56.999
AND IF SHE NEEDS SOMETHING,

06:53.999 --> 06:56.999
YOU'LL GIVE IT TO HER?

06:56.999 --> 06:57.999
Anthony: WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

06:56.999 --> 06:57.999
THAT'S CORRECT.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.999
Lemonis: [ SCOFFS ]

06:59.999 --> 07:01.999
IT'S SURPRISING TO ME

06:59.999 --> 07:01.999
THAT KRISTEN IS OKAY

07:01.999 --> 07:04.999
LEAVING ANTHONY IN CHARGE

07:01.999 --> 07:04.999
OF HER PERSONAL FINANCES.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.999
SHE'S HELPING ANTHONY

07:04.999 --> 07:06.999
RUN THE COMPANY

07:06.999 --> 07:07.999
AND SHE'S NOT EVEN

07:06.999 --> 07:07.999
GETTING A CHECK.

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
Anthony: WELL, I JUST STARTED

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
TAKING A SALARY, TOO.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.999
I SUFFERED

07:10.000 --> 07:11.999
FOR A LONG TIME, AS WELL.

07:11.999 --> 07:12.999
THANK GOD MY FATHER

07:11.999 --> 07:12.999
HELPED ME OUT

07:12.999 --> 07:13.999
WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF STUFF.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.999
Lemonis: IS YOUR FATHER

07:13.999 --> 07:15.999
IN THE SIGN BUSINESS?

07:15.999 --> 07:16.999
Anthony:

07:15.999 --> 07:16.999
HE WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

07:16.999 --> 07:17.999
Lemonis: RIGHT.

07:17.999 --> 07:18.999
Anthony: AND HE JUST RETIRED

07:18.999 --> 07:20.999
AND GAVE UP ON IT

07:18.999 --> 07:20.999
AND JUST SOLD EVERYTHING OFF.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.999
Lemonis: OH, OKAY.

07:22.999 --> 07:23.999
YOU KNOW, CAN WE ACTUALLY LOOK

07:22.999 --> 07:23.999
AT SOME OF THE MACHINERY?

07:23.999 --> 07:24.999
Anthony:

07:23.999 --> 07:24.999
SURE, LET'S GO UP FRONT.

07:24.999 --> 07:26.999
Lemonis:

07:24.999 --> 07:26.999
ANTHONY'S GOT A GREAT SETUP.

07:27.999 --> 07:30.999
THERE ARE MACHINES

07:27.999 --> 07:30.999
THAT CAN BLOW UP PHOTOGRAPHS...

07:32.999 --> 07:34.999
...THAT CAN CUT LETTERS

07:32.999 --> 07:34.999
OUT OF STAINLESS STEEL...

07:37.000 --> 07:38.999
...AND HE'S GOT PEOPLE

07:37.000 --> 07:38.999
THAT CAN WORK

07:38.999 --> 07:41.999
WITH THE LATEST

07:38.999 --> 07:41.999
LIGHTING TECHNOLOGY.

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
WITH ALL THIS

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
IN-HOUSE MANUFACTURING,

07:43.999 --> 07:46.999
ANTHONY HAS TO BE GENERATING

07:43.999 --> 07:46.999
SOME SERIOUS GROSS PROFIT.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
Anthony: DONE.

07:48.999 --> 07:50.999
Lemonis: MAN, THAT WOULD TAKE

07:48.999 --> 07:50.999
HOURS TO DO IT THE OTHER WAY.

07:50.999 --> 07:51.999
Anthony: SEE, THERE'S

07:50.999 --> 07:51.999
NO BUBBLES IN IT?

07:51.999 --> 07:52.999
Lemonis: THERE'S NOTHING.

07:52.999 --> 07:55.999
Anthony:

07:52.999 --> 07:55.999
IT'S 450 BUCKS. DONE.

07:55.999 --> 07:57.999
Lemonis: WHAT'S THIS COST?

07:57.999 --> 07:58.999
Anthony: WHAT, $45, MAYBE?

07:58.999 --> 07:59.999
Kristen: MAYBE $45 OF LABOR.

07:59.999 --> 08:01.999
Anthony:

07:59.999 --> 08:01.999
TREMENDOUS MARKUP ON THIS.

08:01.999 --> 08:03.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

08:01.999 --> 08:03.999
IF THE SIGN COSTS $45 TO MAKE,

08:03.999 --> 08:08.999
AND IT SELLS FOR $450,

08:03.999 --> 08:08.999
THE MARGIN IS 90%.

08:08.999 --> 08:11.999
BECAUSE ANTHONY MAKES

08:08.999 --> 08:11.999
THE SIGNAGE IN HOUSE,

08:11.999 --> 08:13.999
HE'S ABLE TO RETAIN

08:11.999 --> 08:13.999
ALL OF THE MARGIN.

08:13.999 --> 08:16.999
SEEING NUMBERS LIKE THIS MAKES

08:13.999 --> 08:16.999
INVESTING IN THIS INDUSTRY

08:17.000 --> 08:18.999
A LOT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO ME.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.999
AND SO, HOW DOES THE CHAIN

08:18.999 --> 08:21.999
OF COMMAND HERE WORK?

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
Anthony: WE ALL TRY TO WORK

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
VERY WELL TOGETHER.

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
-Lemonis: WHO'S THE BOSS?

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
-Anthony: I'M THE BOSS.

08:25.999 --> 08:27.999
I LIKE TO BE -- AND I HATE

08:25.999 --> 08:27.999
TO SAY IT, I LIKE TO SAY,

08:27.999 --> 08:30.000
"HEY, I'M THE BOSS, LET'S JUST

08:27.999 --> 08:30.000
DO IT THE WAY I WANT TO DO IT."

08:30.999 --> 08:32.999
'CAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,

08:30.999 --> 08:32.999
IF I MAKE THE MISTAKE,

08:32.999 --> 08:33.999
I CAN'T YELL AT THEM.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
Lemonis: YOU'RE LAUGHING 'CAUSE

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.

08:35.999 --> 08:36.999
-Anthony: IT'S TRUE.

08:35.999 --> 08:36.999
-Josh: OH, ME?

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
OH, YEAH,

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
HE'S JUST VERY STUBBORN.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
HE'LL GET UPSET OR FRUSTRATED

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
WHEN WE SAY, "CAN'T DO IT

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
THAT WAY, MAN."

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
Anthony:

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
I DO LISTEN TO ALL PARTIES.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
Josh: HE DOES.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
BUT THERE IS A FINITE LINE.

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
"OKAY, I'M SICK

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
OF TALKING ABOUT IT."

08:52.999 --> 08:54.999
Lemonis:

08:52.999 --> 08:54.999
SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.999
I STILL DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND

08:55.000 --> 08:57.999
ASL's PROCESS --

08:57.999 --> 09:01.999
HOW THEY GENERATE BUSINESS AND

08:57.999 --> 09:01.999
HOW THOSE ORDERS ARE EXECUTED.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.000
SO I WALKED THE FLOOR TO TALK

09:01.999 --> 09:04.000
TO SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES.

09:04.999 --> 09:05.999
-Man: SIR, HOW ARE YOU?

09:04.999 --> 09:05.999
-Lemonis: NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:05.999 --> 09:06.999
-J.R.: HOW YOU DOING?

09:05.999 --> 09:06.999
-Lemonis: J.R.?

09:06.999 --> 09:07.999
-NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS.

09:06.999 --> 09:07.999
-J.R.: NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:08.999 --> 09:11.000
Lemonis: HOW DO YOU KNOW

09:08.999 --> 09:11.000
WHERE THE JOBS ARE?

09:11.999 --> 09:12.999
Man #2: WE DO ALL THE WORK,

09:12.999 --> 09:13.999
SO WE PRETTY MUCH KNOW

09:12.999 --> 09:13.999
WHERE EVERYTHING'S AT.

09:13.999 --> 09:14.999
THESE SIGNS HERE,

09:13.999 --> 09:14.999
I THINK, CAME IN --

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
Lemonis:

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
SO, WHEN THESE SIGNS COME IN,

09:16.999 --> 09:18.999
DO YOU KNOW WHAT SALESPERSON

09:16.999 --> 09:18.999
THEY BELONG TO?

09:18.999 --> 09:19.999
-Man #2: NO.

09:18.999 --> 09:19.999
-Man #3: NO.

09:19.999 --> 09:21.999
-Man #2: THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

09:19.999 --> 09:21.999
-Lemonis: OKAY.

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999
THE SHOP SEEMS

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999
VERY DISORGANIZED,

09:23.999 --> 09:25.999
SO I WANTED TO TALK

09:23.999 --> 09:25.999
TO THE SALES TEAM

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
TO FIND OUT

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
HOW THESE JOBS COME IN.

09:27.999 --> 09:30.999
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO FOLLOW UP

09:27.999 --> 09:30.999
ON A LEAD, OR...?

09:30.999 --> 09:31.999
Edmond: I CALL BACK.

09:31.999 --> 09:34.999
LIKE, ALL OF THESE THAT ARE HERE

09:31.999 --> 09:34.999
ARE PEOPLE THAT I'VE TALKED TO

09:34.999 --> 09:37.999
THAT SAID, "CALL ME IN A FEW

09:34.999 --> 09:37.999
WEEKS," "CALL ME IN THIS TIME."

09:37.999 --> 09:38.999
Lemonis:

09:37.999 --> 09:38.999
I FEEL LIKE 1985 CALLED,

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
AND THEY WANT

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
THEIR SALES PRICES BACK.

09:40.999 --> 09:41.999
Edmond: I KNOW. MM-HMM.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.999
Woman: IT'S DEFINITELY NOT

09:41.999 --> 09:43.999
100% ACCURATE.

09:43.999 --> 09:46.999
Lemonis: MAYBE ANTHONY'S FATHER,

09:43.999 --> 09:46.999
LOUIS, CAN SHED SOME LIGHT

09:46.999 --> 09:48.999
ABOUT HOW ANTHONY RUNS THINGS

09:46.999 --> 09:48.999
AROUND HERE.

09:48.999 --> 09:49.999
Lemonis: HOW MUCH MONEY

09:48.999 --> 09:49.999
DO YOU HAVE IN HERE?

09:49.999 --> 09:53.999
Louis:

09:49.999 --> 09:53.999
ABOUT $220,000, $225,000.

09:53.999 --> 09:54.999
SOMEWHERE.

09:54.999 --> 09:57.999
-Lemonis: FOR REAL?

09:54.999 --> 09:57.999
-Louis: YEAH.

09:57.999 --> 09:58.999
Lemonis: HE HASN'T PAID YOU

09:57.999 --> 09:58.999
ANYTHING BACK?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
-Louis: NO, HE HAS NOT.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
-Lemonis: OH, MY GOSH.

10:00.999 --> 10:03.999
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I SHOULD

10:00.999 --> 10:03.999
KNOW ABOUT HIM, BE HONEST,

10:03.999 --> 10:06.999
THAT WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY

10:03.999 --> 10:06.999
THAT DRIVES YOU CRAZY?

10:06.999 --> 10:09.999
Louis: I'M FROM THE OLD SCHOOL.

10:06.999 --> 10:09.999
I'M THE OLD MAN.

10:09.999 --> 10:11.999
SO, SOMETIMES HE THINKS

10:09.999 --> 10:11.999
HE KNOWS IT ALL,

10:11.999 --> 10:12.999
AND YOU HAVE TO

10:11.999 --> 10:12.999
STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT,

10:12.999 --> 10:14.999
SAY, "NO,

10:12.999 --> 10:14.999
YOU DON'T KNOW IT ALL."

10:14.999 --> 10:16.999
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, HEY,

10:14.999 --> 10:16.999
I THOUGHT I KNEW IT ALL, TOO.

10:16.999 --> 10:17.999
Lemonis: YEAH.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
IT'S A TERRIBLE SIGN

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
THAT ANTHONY DOESN'T TAKE ADVICE

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
FROM HIS FATHER,

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
ESPECIALLY SINCE HIS FATHER

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
IS HIS BANKER.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.999
I WONDER HOW HE'S GONNA TAKE

10:23.999 --> 10:26.999
ADVICE FROM AN OUTSIDE PARTY?

10:29.999 --> 10:31.000
Todd: HOW YOU DOING TODAY?

10:31.999 --> 10:32.999
-Josh: GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

10:31.999 --> 10:32.999
-Todd: PRETTY GOOD.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.999
I NEED A SIGN REFURBISHED.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.999
DO YOU DO THAT?

10:35.999 --> 10:36.999
Josh: WE CAN DO IT ALL,

10:35.999 --> 10:36.999
PRETTY MUCH.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.999
WHAT KIND OF A SIGN

10:37.000 --> 10:39.999
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
-PirateLand RESORT?

10:41.999 --> 10:43.999
-Todd: MAIN SIGN OUT FRONT.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
-Josh: OKAY.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
-Todd: SO, ARE YOU THE OWNER?

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
-Josh: NO.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
-Anthony: NO, I'M THE OWNER.

10:47.999 --> 10:48.999
-Todd: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

10:47.999 --> 10:48.999
-Anthony: ANTHONY.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.999
Todd: ANTHONY. TODD.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.999
HOW ARE YOU?

10:50.999 --> 10:52.999
Anthony:

10:50.999 --> 10:52.999
THIS IS MY CARD, TOO.

10:52.999 --> 10:53.999
Lemonis:

10:52.999 --> 10:53.999
YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

10:53.999 --> 10:54.999
Todd: IS YOUR PRIVATE CELLPHONE

10:53.999 --> 10:54.999
ON HERE?

10:54.999 --> 10:56.999
Anthony:

10:54.999 --> 10:56.999
I CAN PUT IT ON THERE.

10:56.999 --> 10:59.000
KRIS, DO YOU HAVE A MARKER,

10:56.999 --> 10:59.000
PLEASE?

10:59.999 --> 11:00.999
Lemonis: HOW DO YOU GET THE GUY

10:59.999 --> 11:00.999
TO WANT TO COME IN,

11:00.999 --> 11:02.999
OTHER THAN JUST GIVING HIM

11:00.999 --> 11:02.999
A BUSINESS CARD?

11:02.999 --> 11:05.999
Anthony: I CAN OFFER SOME,

11:02.999 --> 11:05.999
YOU KNOW, FREE BUSINESS CARDS

11:05.999 --> 11:07.999
IF HE SIGNS A SIGN WITH US.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.999
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS --

11:07.999 --> 11:10.999
Lemonis: NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:07.999 --> 11:10.999
LIKE, HE CAME IN TO GET WHAT?

11:10.999 --> 11:11.999
Anthony: A RE-FACE ON A SIGN.

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
Lemonis: OKAY, SO,

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
WHAT COULD YOU DO RIGHT NOW

11:14.999 --> 11:16.999
THAT WOULD GET THE GUY

11:14.999 --> 11:16.999
TO REALIZE YOU'RE SERIOUS?

11:16.999 --> 11:17.999
Anthony: I'M THINKING.

11:16.999 --> 11:17.999
I DON'T KNOW.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.999
Lemonis: HIS BUSINESS

11:18.000 --> 11:19.999
IS A MILE DOWN THE ROAD.

11:19.999 --> 11:21.999
Kristen: I WOULD GO THERE.

11:22.999 --> 11:24.999
Lemonis: WHY ARE YOU

11:22.999 --> 11:24.999
NOT GOING THERE?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.999
Anthony:

11:25.000 --> 11:26.999
I DON'T KNOW, MARCUS.

11:26.999 --> 11:28.000
-Lemonis: THIS ISN'T A TEST.

11:26.999 --> 11:28.000
-Anthony: NO, I KNOW.

11:28.999 --> 11:29.999
WE USUALLY WOULD FOLLOW IT UP

11:28.999 --> 11:29.999
TOMORROW OR THE NEXT DAY.

11:29.999 --> 11:31.999
Lemonis: I WASN'T ASKING YOU

11:29.999 --> 11:31.999
TO CHANGE YOUR PROCESS,

11:31.999 --> 11:34.999
I WAS ASKING YOU TO TELL ME

11:31.999 --> 11:34.999
WHAT YOUR PROCESS WAS.

11:34.999 --> 11:36.999
Anthony:

11:34.999 --> 11:36.999
I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD SYSTEM.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.999
Kristen: I THINK

11:39.999 --> 11:41.999
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

11:41.999 --> 11:44.999
Lemonis: I SEE A CUSTOMER WALK

11:41.999 --> 11:44.999
IN, I SEE POTENTIAL BUSINESS,

11:44.999 --> 11:47.999
AND ANTHONY'S NOT DOING ANYTHING

11:44.999 --> 11:47.999
TO HUSTLE THE SALE.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.999
I'D LIKE TO GO OVER

11:48.999 --> 11:51.999
THE FINANCIALS WITH YOU.

11:51.999 --> 11:55.999
Kristen: THIS IS THE FINANCIAL

11:51.999 --> 11:55.999
STATEMENTS THROUGH '12 TO '13.

11:55.999 --> 11:58.999
Lemonis: OH, OKAY.

11:55.999 --> 11:58.999
LET'S START WITH THAT.

11:58.999 --> 12:00.999
HOW MUCH CASH IS IN THE BANK

11:58.999 --> 12:00.999
RIGHT NOW?

12:00.999 --> 12:03.999
Kristen: RIGHT NOW,

12:00.999 --> 12:03.999
I'D SAY ABOUT $75,000.

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
-Lemonis: THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
-Kristen: YES.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.999
Lemonis:

12:06.000 --> 12:07.999
AND HOW MUCH IN RECEIVABLES?

12:07.999 --> 12:09.999
Kristen: IN RECEIVABLES,

12:07.999 --> 12:09.999
WE HAVE $60,000.

12:09.999 --> 12:11.999
Lemonis:

12:09.999 --> 12:11.999
SO, $135,000 IN ASSETS.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
AND THEN HOW MUCH

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
DO YOU OWE PEOPLE?

12:13.999 --> 12:15.999
CREDIT CARDS, BANK LOANS?

12:15.999 --> 12:17.999
-Kristen: ABOUT $25,000.

12:15.999 --> 12:17.999
-Lemonis: OKAY.

12:17.999 --> 12:21.999
THERE'S $135,000 ON THE BOOKS

12:17.999 --> 12:21.999
BETWEEN CASH AND RECEIVABLES,

12:21.999 --> 12:24.999
AND THERE'S ONLY $25,000

12:21.999 --> 12:24.999
IN DEBT.

12:24.999 --> 12:26.999
FOR A NEW BUSINESS, THEY'RE

12:24.999 --> 12:26.999
ACTUALLY DOING PRETTY GOOD.

12:26.999 --> 12:27.999
ANY OTHER DEBT ON THE BOOKS?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.999
Kristen:

12:28.000 --> 12:29.999
JUST OUR DEBT WITH LOU.

12:29.999 --> 12:30.999
-Lemonis: ANTHONY'S DAD?

12:29.999 --> 12:30.999
-Kristen: ANTHONY'S DAD, YES.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.999
AND HOW MUCH IS THAT?

12:32.999 --> 12:34.999
Kristen:

12:32.999 --> 12:34.999
ROUGHLY ABOUT $200,000.

12:34.999 --> 12:36.999
Lemonis: AND SO, I DON'T SEE

12:34.999 --> 12:36.999
THAT ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
IS THAT NOT ON YOUR BOOKS,

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
BUT IT'S IN REALITY, OR...?

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
Kristen: YEAH, IT'S NOT LISTED

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
WITHIN THE COMPANY.

12:40.999 --> 12:42.999
Lemonis: OKAY,

12:40.999 --> 12:42.999
SO IT'S NOT A COMPANY ASSET,

12:42.999 --> 12:43.999
-AND IT'S NOT A COMPANY DEBT.

12:42.999 --> 12:43.999
-Kristen: RIGHT.

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
Lemonis:

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
SO, WHAT I'M NOTICING IS,

12:45.999 --> 12:46.999
PRETTY GOOD INCREASE IN SALES.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.999
2012, $105,000.

12:48.999 --> 12:51.000
2013, $278,000.

12:51.999 --> 12:52.999
WHERE ARE YOU

12:51.999 --> 12:52.999
AT YEAR TO DATE NOW?

12:52.999 --> 12:54.999
Kristen: RIGHT NOW,

12:52.999 --> 12:54.999
WE'RE AT $441,000.

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

12:56.999 --> 12:58.999
AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

12:56.999 --> 12:58.999
YOU'RE GONNA FINISH AT?

12:58.999 --> 13:00.999
Kristen: I'M HOPING, YOU KNOW,

12:58.999 --> 13:00.999
BETWEEN $600,000 AND $700,000.

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
Lemonis:

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD GROWTH.

13:02.999 --> 13:03.999
REALLY GOOD GROWTH, ACTUALLY.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.999
HOW MUCH IS THE RENT HERE

13:03.999 --> 13:05.999
A MONTH?

13:05.999 --> 13:06.999
Kristen: $2,000 A MONTH.

13:06.999 --> 13:08.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

13:06.999 --> 13:08.999
AND YOU GUYS PAY THAT?

13:08.999 --> 13:09.999
Kristen: LOU GIVES US $1,000.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.999
-Lemonis: HE PAYS HALF THE RENT?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.999
-Kristen: YEAH.

13:11.999 --> 13:12.999
Lemonis:

13:11.999 --> 13:12.999
I MEAN, THANK GOD HE'S HERE.

13:12.999 --> 13:14.999
I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T HAVE

13:12.999 --> 13:14.999
STARTED THIS BUSINESS...

13:14.999 --> 13:15.999
-Kristen: NO WAY.

13:14.999 --> 13:15.999
-Lemonis: ...WITHOUT HIM.

13:15.999 --> 13:16.999
Kristen: NOPE.

13:16.999 --> 13:18.999
Lemonis: AND DOES HE OWN

13:16.999 --> 13:18.999
ANY SHARES IN THE BUSINESS?

13:18.999 --> 13:19.999
Kristen: NO.

13:19.999 --> 13:20.999
Lemonis: YOU AND ANTHONY

13:19.999 --> 13:20.999
OWN THE EQUITY?

13:20.999 --> 13:22.999
-Kristen: ANTHONY DOES.

13:20.999 --> 13:22.999
-Lemonis: NOT YOU?

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
-Kristen: NO.

13:22.999 --> 13:24.999
-Lemonis: OKAY.

13:24.999 --> 13:27.999
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE INVOLVED

13:24.999 --> 13:27.999
IN PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING.

13:27.999 --> 13:29.999
-AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAID.

13:27.999 --> 13:29.999
-Kristen: RIGHT.

13:29.999 --> 13:30.999
Lemonis:

13:29.999 --> 13:30.999
EVERYBODY ELSE THINKS

13:30.999 --> 13:32.999
THAT THEY'RE JUST OWED

13:30.999 --> 13:32.999
SOMETHING,

13:32.999 --> 13:33.999
AND YOU SEEM TO JUST WANT

13:33.999 --> 13:35.999
TO JUST PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN

13:33.999 --> 13:35.999
AND WORK FOR IT.

13:35.999 --> 13:36.999
Kristen: YES.

13:36.999 --> 13:39.999
Lemonis: I DON'T GET

13:36.999 --> 13:39.999
THAT SAME SENSE FROM ANTHONY.

13:39.999 --> 13:42.000
Kristen: I CAN ONLY SAY HE'LL

13:39.999 --> 13:42.000
ALWAYS WORK AS HARD AS I DO.

13:42.999 --> 13:43.999
Lemonis: YEAH.

13:42.999 --> 13:43.999
NO, NO, NO.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.000
I KNOW HIM AND YOU

13:43.999 --> 13:45.000
ARE VERY DIFFERENT.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.999
Kristen: HE'S RARE.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.999
AND HE LOVES TO HAVE FUN.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.999
YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT TRYING

13:47.999 --> 13:49.999
TO BE RUDE ALL THE TIME,

13:49.999 --> 13:51.999
IT'S JUST SOMETIMES

13:49.999 --> 13:51.999
IT COMES OFF THAT WAY.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.999
BUT HE'S REALLY

13:51.999 --> 13:53.999
JUST TRYING TO HAVE FUN.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.999
Lemonis: THE PROBLEM IS,

13:55.999 --> 13:58.999
PEOPLE'S DEMEANOR RUB ANYBODY

13:55.999 --> 13:58.999
THE WRONG WAY, IT'S A PROBLEM.

13:58.999 --> 14:01.999
HIS DAD HAD SAID

13:58.999 --> 14:01.999
THAT HE'S A KNOW-IT-ALL.

14:01.999 --> 14:02.999
Kristen: MM-HMM.

14:02.999 --> 14:03.999
Lemonis: THAT CAN REALLY AFFECT

14:02.999 --> 14:03.999
THE BUSINESS.

14:08.999 --> 14:11.999
THIS IS A HEALTHY BUSINESS,

14:11.999 --> 14:13.999
AND IT'S GOT REAL POTENTIAL

14:11.999 --> 14:13.999
TO GROW AND TO GROW QUICKLY.

14:13.999 --> 14:16.999
AND WITH ANY PARTNER,

14:13.999 --> 14:16.999
I NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE.

14:16.999 --> 14:17.999
AND I HAVE TO BE HONEST,

14:17.999 --> 14:19.999
WITH ANTHONY,

14:17.999 --> 14:19.999
I HAVE SOME REAL RESERVATIONS.

14:19.999 --> 14:21.999
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB.

14:21.999 --> 14:22.999
Anthony: THANK YOU.

14:22.999 --> 14:23.999
Kristen: THANK YOU.

14:23.999 --> 14:25.999
Lemonis: I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.999
IT'S A $500,000-PLUS BUSINESS

14:25.999 --> 14:28.999
IN 36 MONTHS.

14:28.999 --> 14:29.999
Anthony: YEAH,

14:28.999 --> 14:29.999
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.999
Lemonis: YOU'VE GOT MONEY

14:29.999 --> 14:31.999
IN THE BANK.

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
ANTHONY, WHY'D YOU CALL ME HERE?

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
Anthony: I CALLED YOU HERE

14:35.999 --> 14:38.999
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING FOR THAT

14:35.999 --> 14:38.999
NEXT STEP IN MY BUSINESS.

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
I WANT TO DEAL WITH A LOT

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
OF NATIONAL COMPANIES.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I DON'T WANT TO DEAL

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
WITH MOM-AND-POPS ANYMORE.

14:43.999 --> 14:44.999
WITH AS MANY BUSINESSES

14:43.999 --> 14:44.999
THAT YOU OWN

14:44.999 --> 14:47.999
AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU

14:44.999 --> 14:47.999
KNOW, THAT YOU CAN BRING THAT.

14:47.999 --> 14:49.999
Lemonis: BUT FOR YOU TO SAY,

14:47.999 --> 14:49.999
"I WANT TO BE YOUR PARTNER

14:49.999 --> 14:51.999
BECAUSE YOU CAN BRING ME

14:49.999 --> 14:51.999
ALL YOUR BUSINESSES,"

14:51.999 --> 14:52.999
WE COULD JUST HAVE

14:51.999 --> 14:52.999
A RELATIONSHIP

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
-AND YOU COULD EARN MY BUSINESS.

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
-Anthony: RIGHT.

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
Lemonis: WE DON'T HAVE TO BE

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
PARTNERS FOR US TO DO THAT.

14:56.999 --> 15:00.999
I DON'T SEE A NEED FOR ME.

15:00.999 --> 15:01.999
I DON'T THINK

15:00.999 --> 15:01.999
YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN.

15:01.999 --> 15:03.999
I THINK YOU THINK

15:01.999 --> 15:03.999
YOU KNOW IT ALL,

15:03.999 --> 15:05.999
AND SO, THAT'S GONNA BE

15:03.999 --> 15:05.999
A CHALLENGE FOR ME.

15:05.999 --> 15:08.999
Anthony: NO. YOU DON'T KNOW ME

15:05.999 --> 15:08.999
THAT MUCH WELL.

15:08.999 --> 15:09.999
Lemonis: WELL,

15:08.999 --> 15:09.999
I DON'T KNOW YOU THAT MUCH.

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
BUT EVERYBODY ELSE,

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
INCLUDING YOUR FATHER,

15:10.999 --> 15:12.999
TOLD ME YOU'RE A KNOW-IT-ALL.

15:12.999 --> 15:13.999
Anthony: WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T

15:12.999 --> 15:13.999
LISTEN TO WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE.

15:13.999 --> 15:15.999
LIKE YOU SAID, YOU SHOULD LISTEN

15:13.999 --> 15:15.999
TO WHAT YOU FEEL.

15:15.999 --> 15:16.999
Lemonis: WELL,

15:15.999 --> 15:16.999
I FEEL THAT WAY, TOO.

15:20.999 --> 15:23.999
YEAH, I MEAN, LOOK, I THINK

15:20.999 --> 15:23.999
YOU HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE.

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
WHETHER I'M IN THE DEAL OR NOT.

15:25.999 --> 15:27.999
YOU'RE GONNA BE FANTASTIC.

15:25.999 --> 15:27.999
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN FIRST PLACE.

15:27.999 --> 15:28.999
Anthony: EVENTUALLY.

15:28.999 --> 15:30.999
Lemonis: WHAT IS THIS

15:28.999 --> 15:30.999
TIME THING FOR YOU?

15:30.999 --> 15:32.999
Anthony:

15:30.999 --> 15:32.999
I'M A NOW TYPE OF GUY.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.999
Lemonis: BUT IT'S A MARATHON

15:32.999 --> 15:34.999
AND NOT A SPRINT.

15:34.999 --> 15:37.999
I WANT TO BE

15:34.999 --> 15:37.999
IN THE SIGN BUSINESS

15:37.999 --> 15:42.999
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT EVERY

15:37.999 --> 15:42.999
SINGLE PERSON NEEDS A SIGN.

15:42.999 --> 15:44.999
SO I'M GETTING

15:42.999 --> 15:44.999
IN THE SIGN BUSINESS.

15:44.999 --> 15:47.999
QUESTION IS, AM I GETTING

15:44.999 --> 15:47.999
IN THE SIGN BUSINESS WITH YOU?

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
Lemonis: I'M GETTING

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
IN THE SIGN BUSINESS.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.999
QUESTION IS, AM I GETTING

15:57.999 --> 16:00.999
IN THE SIGN BUSINESS WITH YOU?

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
Anthony: YOU WILL BE.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
I'M GONNA PROVE TO YOU.

16:03.999 --> 16:04.999
Lemonis: HOW DO I OVERCOME

16:04.999 --> 16:08.999
YOU NOT BEING THE MOST PROCESS-,

16:04.999 --> 16:08.999
STRUCTURE-ORIENTED GUY?

16:08.999 --> 16:11.999
HOW DO I OVERCOME

16:08.999 --> 16:11.999
YOU THINKING YOU'RE RIGHT

16:11.999 --> 16:13.999
MORE OFTEN THAN YOU ARE?

16:13.999 --> 16:14.999
HOW DO I OVERCOME ALL THAT?

16:14.999 --> 16:16.999
Anthony: WELL, IF YOU'RE WILLING

16:14.999 --> 16:16.999
TO TAKE A GAMBLE,

16:16.999 --> 16:16.999
I'M WILLING TO PROVE THAT

16:16.999 --> 16:16.999
TO YOU.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.999
Lemonis:

16:17.000 --> 16:18.999
I DON'T WANT TO GAMBLE.

16:18.999 --> 16:21.999
THAT'S THE WRONG CLOSING LINE.

16:21.999 --> 16:25.999
I LIKE TO BET ON PEOPLE

16:21.999 --> 16:25.999
THAT I KNOW I CAN COUNT ON.

16:25.999 --> 16:31.000
I LIKE YOU AS PEOPLE.

16:25.999 --> 16:31.000
I LIKE YOUR PRODUCT.

16:31.999 --> 16:33.999
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I COULD

16:31.999 --> 16:33.999
CHANGE THE PROCESS,

16:33.999 --> 16:36.999
'CAUSE I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE

16:33.999 --> 16:36.999
WILLING TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.999
AND SO, I HAVEN'T DONE THIS.

16:42.999 --> 16:44.999
I'M NOT PREPARED

16:42.999 --> 16:44.999
TO WRITE A CHECK TONIGHT.

16:49.999 --> 16:53.999
I'M WILLING TO DEDICATE TIME,

16:49.999 --> 16:53.999
ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES,

16:53.999 --> 16:56.999
LOOK AT THE PROCESS,

16:53.999 --> 16:56.999
AND FIX THINGS.

16:56.999 --> 16:59.999
AND AT SOME POINT, I'M EITHER

16:56.999 --> 16:59.999
GONNA WRITE A CHECK...

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
-Anthony: OR YOU'RE NOT.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
-Lemonis: ...OR I'M NOT.

17:01.999 --> 17:02.999
SO I'M GONNA PUT

17:01.999 --> 17:02.999
MY CHECKBOOK AWAY...

17:02.999 --> 17:03.999
Anthony: MM-HMM.

17:03.999 --> 17:05.999
Lemonis:

17:03.999 --> 17:05.999
...BUT I'M NOT WALKING AWAY.

17:05.999 --> 17:07.999
Anthony: THAT'S FINE.

17:05.999 --> 17:07.999
AND I RESPECT THAT.

17:07.999 --> 17:10.999
Lemonis: OKAY? ALL RIGHT.

17:07.999 --> 17:10.999
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

17:17.999 --> 17:18.999
Josh:

17:17.999 --> 17:18.999
HOW DID IT GO LAST NIGHT?

17:18.999 --> 17:19.999
Kristen: IT WAS INTERESTING.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.999
Josh: LIKE,

17:20.999 --> 17:23.999
WHAT KIND OF INTERESTING?

17:23.999 --> 17:25.999
Kristen: I GUESS

17:23.999 --> 17:25.999
HE'S HAVING A HARD TIME

17:25.999 --> 17:27.999
WITH THINKING HE CAN DO BUSINESS

17:25.999 --> 17:27.999
WITH ANTHONY,

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
AND HE THINKS

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
HE'S A KNOW-IT-ALL.

17:29.999 --> 17:32.999
-Josh: DID HE MAKE AN OFFER?

17:29.999 --> 17:32.999
-Kristen: NO.

17:32.999 --> 17:35.999
Josh: I CAN'T BELIEVE

17:32.999 --> 17:35.999
THAT HE DIDN'T WRITE A CHECK.

17:35.999 --> 17:38.999
Anthony: HE DIDN'T WANT

17:35.999 --> 17:38.999
TO WRITE A CHECK, SO I THINK...

17:38.999 --> 17:39.999
Louis: WELL, HOPEFULLY

17:39.999 --> 17:41.000
YOU'LL CLEAR UP ANY ISSUES

17:39.999 --> 17:41.000
HE MIGHT HAVE.

17:41.999 --> 17:42.999
Anthony: YOU WANT ME

17:41.999 --> 17:42.999
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU?

17:42.999 --> 17:44.999
I DON'T WANT HIS MONEY.

17:42.999 --> 17:44.999
I DON'T WANT HIS CHECK.

17:44.999 --> 17:45.999
I WANT THE BUSINESS

17:44.999 --> 17:45.999
THAT HE CAN BRING.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.999
Louis: WELL, IF HE CAN BRING YOU

17:45.999 --> 17:47.999
THE BUSINESS --

17:47.999 --> 17:48.999
Anthony:

17:47.999 --> 17:48.999
I CAN ALWAYS MAKE MONEY.

17:48.999 --> 17:49.999
I CAN ALWAYS MAKE MORE MONEY.

17:49.999 --> 17:51.999
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

17:49.999 --> 17:51.999
IF I DON'T HAVE THE BUSINESS,

17:51.999 --> 17:52.999
I DON'T HAVE THE BUSINESS,

17:51.999 --> 17:52.999
WHETHER HE'S MY PARTNER OR NOT.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
Louis: THAT'S TRUE.

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
Anthony: I WANT HIM TO FIGURE

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
OUT I'M A GO-GETTER.

17:56.999 --> 17:57.999
I'M A GO-GO GUY.

17:57.999 --> 17:59.999
THERE'S NO -- YOU KNOW,

17:57.999 --> 17:59.999
THERE'S ONLY ONE SPEED WITH ME.

17:59.999 --> 18:00.999
IT'S JUST GO.

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
Louis:

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
WELL, TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.999
Anthony: AND IF HE'S WILLING

18:02.999 --> 18:05.999
TO GIVE ME $1.5 MILLION A YEAR

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
IN WHAT HE SAYS HE HAS,

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
KEEP THE MONEY.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
Louis: OKAY.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
HOPEFULLY I CAN --

18:09.999 --> 18:12.999
Anthony: I'M NOT BEGGING HIM.

18:09.999 --> 18:12.999
I JUST WANT THE BUSINESS.

18:14.999 --> 18:16.999
Louis: WELL,

18:14.999 --> 18:16.999
LET ME CLEAN THIS FLOOR.

18:16.999 --> 18:18.999
Anthony: YEAH, GET TO WORK.

18:16.999 --> 18:18.999
I'M OVERPAYING YOU.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.999
-ALL RIGHTY.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.999
-Louis: OH, BOY.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
Lemonis: I'M NOT READY

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
TO DO A DEAL WITH ANTHONY.

18:25.999 --> 18:26.999
NOT YET AT LEAST.

18:26.999 --> 18:28.999
BUT I'M WILLING TO START

18:26.999 --> 18:28.999
WORKING ON THE PROCESS

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
TO IMPROVE THE EXPERIENCE

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
FOR CUSTOMERS.

18:30.999 --> 18:32.999
FIRST IMPRESSIONS

18:30.999 --> 18:32.999
ARE EVERYTHING.

18:32.999 --> 18:33.999
IF I'M A CUSTOMER

18:32.999 --> 18:33.999
AND I'M PULLING UP,

18:33.999 --> 18:36.999
I LOOK AT ALL THIS CRAP.

18:36.999 --> 18:37.999
LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF

18:36.999 --> 18:37.999
BACK THERE.

18:37.999 --> 18:38.999
Anthony: MM-HMM.

18:38.999 --> 18:41.999
Lemonis:

18:38.999 --> 18:41.999
IT LOOKS LIKE A DISASTER.

18:41.999 --> 18:44.000
I CALLED IN A SALVAGE COMPANY

18:41.999 --> 18:44.000
TO COME CLEAN UP ALL THE JUNK

18:44.999 --> 18:45.999
THAT'S LYING

18:44.999 --> 18:45.999
AROUND ANTHONY'S BUILDING.

18:51.999 --> 18:53.999
WHILE THE CREW IS WORKING

18:51.999 --> 18:53.999
ON THE OUTSIDE,

18:53.999 --> 18:56.999
I WANT TO BEGIN CLEARING UP

18:53.999 --> 18:56.999
THE CLUTTER ON THE INSIDE.

18:56.999 --> 18:58.999
I'M A CUSTOMER.

18:56.999 --> 18:58.999
"WELCOME TO MY STORE."

18:58.999 --> 19:00.999
Louis: LOOKS TRASHY.

19:00.999 --> 19:01.999
Anthony: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
THIS CAN BE MOVED.

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
THIS CAN BE MOVED.

19:05.999 --> 19:07.999
OKEYDOKEY!

19:09.999 --> 19:11.999
Lemonis:

19:09.999 --> 19:11.999
AND IT'S ALSO BENEFICIAL

19:11.999 --> 19:13.999
THAT THE SALES PRESENTATION

19:13.999 --> 19:15.999
HAS A CENTRAL FOCUS

19:13.999 --> 19:15.999
OR A STARTING POINT.

19:15.999 --> 19:17.999
WHAT'S --

19:15.999 --> 19:17.999
WHAT'S THAT DOWN BELOW?

19:17.999 --> 19:18.999
Kristen:

19:17.999 --> 19:18.999
THIS IS A LITTLE GUIDE.

19:18.999 --> 19:21.999
SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE

19:18.999 --> 19:21.999
OF SIGN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.

19:21.999 --> 19:22.999
THEY DON'T KNOW

19:21.999 --> 19:22.999
WHAT IT'S CALLED.

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
Lemonis:

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S AWESOME.

19:24.999 --> 19:27.999
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT THING

19:24.999 --> 19:27.999
BE THIS BIG.

19:27.999 --> 19:28.999
AND WHEN PEOPLE COME IN,

19:28.999 --> 19:30.999
"WHAT KIND OF SIGN

19:28.999 --> 19:30.999
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?"

19:30.999 --> 19:31.999
Anthony: BOOM, HERE IT IS.

19:31.999 --> 19:33.999
Lemonis: THAT'S THE FIRST PLACE

19:31.999 --> 19:33.999
THEY COME TO.

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
AND THEN THEY WANT TO SEE

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
A SAMPLE OF IT,

19:35.999 --> 19:37.999
THEN WE TAKE THEM TO WHAT IT IS

19:35.999 --> 19:37.999
THEY WANT TO SEE.

19:37.999 --> 19:38.999
ONCE WE HAVE THIS,

19:37.999 --> 19:38.999
WE HAVE THE START

19:38.999 --> 19:40.999
OF BUILDING A SALES PRESENTATION

19:38.999 --> 19:40.999
OVER HERE.

19:52.999 --> 19:54.999
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND

19:52.999 --> 19:54.999
HOW AN ORDER ACTUALLY WENT

19:54.999 --> 19:56.999
FROM THE BEGINNING

19:54.999 --> 19:56.999
TO THE INSTALLATION,

19:56.999 --> 19:58.999
SO I SPENT A LITTLE TIME

19:56.999 --> 19:58.999
WITH JOSH

19:58.999 --> 20:00.999
WHILE HE WAS WORKING ON AN ORDER

19:58.999 --> 20:00.999
FROM A TANNING COMPANY.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.999
WHO PICKS THE ARTWORK?

20:02.999 --> 20:05.999
Josh: I TRY TO POINT PEOPLE

20:02.999 --> 20:05.999
IN AN APPROPRIATE DIRECTION.

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999
PEOPLE ALSO HAVE

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999
THEIR OPINIONS, THOUGH.

20:10.999 --> 20:12.999
Lemonis: LET ME TELL YOU

20:10.999 --> 20:12.999
WHAT MY ISSUE IS.

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
THIS IS NOT A GOOD SIGN.

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
WHO CREATED THAT LOGO?

20:17.999 --> 20:18.999
Josh:

20:17.999 --> 20:18.999
ANTHONY PICKED THE FONT.

20:18.999 --> 20:20.999
Lemonis:

20:18.999 --> 20:20.999
ANTHONY PICKED THE FONT?

20:20.999 --> 20:21.999
Josh: YES.

20:21.999 --> 20:22.999
Lemonis:

20:21.999 --> 20:22.999
WHY IS HE PICKING THE FONT?

20:22.999 --> 20:23.999
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE DESIGNER.

20:23.999 --> 20:25.999
Josh:

20:23.999 --> 20:25.999
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED TO SEE.

20:25.999 --> 20:26.999
WELL, I'LL SHOW YOU

20:25.999 --> 20:26.999
WHAT I STARTED WITH.

20:26.999 --> 20:28.999
Lemonis:

20:26.999 --> 20:28.999
THIS IS YOUR ORIGINAL DESIGN?

20:28.999 --> 20:29.999
-Josh: YES.

20:28.999 --> 20:29.999
-Lemonis: VERY CLEAN.

20:29.999 --> 20:30.999
I CAN READ EVERY LETTER.

20:30.999 --> 20:32.999
AND THE CUSTOMER DIDN'T LIKE IT?

20:32.999 --> 20:34.999
Josh:

20:32.999 --> 20:34.999
THE CUSTOMER NEVER SAW IT.

20:34.999 --> 20:35.999
Lemonis:

20:34.999 --> 20:35.999
OKAY, SO ANTHONY CAME IN,

20:35.999 --> 20:38.999
NOT A DESIGNER, NOT YEARS

20:35.999 --> 20:38.999
IN THE BUSINESS, RIGHT?

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
-Josh: RIGHT.

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
-Lemonis: AND SAID TO YOU,

20:40.999 --> 20:42.999
"I DON'T LIKE THAT DESIGN.

20:40.999 --> 20:42.999
THIS IS THE DESIGN I WANT."

20:42.999 --> 20:44.999
Josh: YES. PRETTY MUCH.

20:44.999 --> 20:47.999
Lemonis: WHEN WE'RE DOING

20:44.999 --> 20:47.999
CREATIVE IN THE SIGN BUSINESS,

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
YOUR ODDS OF GETTING

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
THE CUSTOMER TO COME BACK

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
OR REFER SOMEBODY ELSE

20:49.999 --> 20:51.999
ARE EXPONENTIALLY BETTER

20:51.999 --> 20:53.999
-IF THE SIGN BRINGS IN BUSINESS.

20:51.999 --> 20:53.999
-Josh: RIGHT.

20:53.999 --> 20:55.999
Lemonis: I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

20:53.999 --> 20:55.999
I CAN READ THAT.

20:55.999 --> 20:56.999
-CAN YOU READ THAT?

20:55.999 --> 20:56.999
-Josh: YES.

20:56.999 --> 20:58.999
-Lemonis: CAN YOU READ THAT?

20:56.999 --> 20:58.999
-Josh: NO.

20:58.999 --> 20:59.999
-Lemonis: NO.

20:58.999 --> 20:59.999
-Josh: NO.

20:59.999 --> 21:01.000
Lemonis: SO LET ME GRAB HIM.

21:01.999 --> 21:02.999
HEY, ANTHONY, I NEED

21:01.999 --> 21:02.999
TO BORROW YOU REAL QUICK

21:02.999 --> 21:03.999
-WHILE THEY'RE WORKING.

21:02.999 --> 21:03.999
-Anthony: SURE.

21:05.999 --> 21:06.999
YES, SIR?

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
Lemonis:

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
SO, I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND,

21:08.999 --> 21:09.999
WHO IS THE DESIGNER

21:08.999 --> 21:09.999
IN THIS BUILDING?

21:09.999 --> 21:11.999
Anthony:

21:09.999 --> 21:11.999
JOSH IS THE DESIGNER.

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
Lemonis: PERFECT.

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
SO YOU TRUST HIS JUDGMENT 100%?

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
Anthony: I TRUST HIS JUDGMENT,

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
BUT SOMETIMES,

21:15.999 --> 21:17.999
WHEN I GET THAT VIBE

21:15.999 --> 21:17.999
OFF THE CUSTOMER,

21:17.999 --> 21:19.999
I LIKE TO PUT MY TWO CENTS IN.

21:19.999 --> 21:21.999
Lemonis: YOU HAD A VIBE

21:19.999 --> 21:21.999
FROM THIS CUSTOMER?

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
-Anthony: YEAH.

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
-Lemonis: THEY SAW THIS LOGO?

21:23.999 --> 21:26.999
Anthony: THAT WAS THE...

21:23.999 --> 21:26.999
NO, THEY DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE.

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
Lemonis:

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
OKAY, SO HERE'S THE ISSUE.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.999
THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
OF HOW OUR BUSINESS

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
CAN FALL OFF THE RAILS.

21:32.999 --> 21:35.000
WE START HAVING YOU

21:32.999 --> 21:35.000
IN THE DESIGN DEPARTMENT,

21:35.999 --> 21:38.999
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

21:35.999 --> 21:38.999
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT SAYS.

21:38.999 --> 21:39.999
Anthony: OKAY.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.999
Lemonis: DO YOU...?

21:41.999 --> 21:42.999
Anthony: IT JUST LOOKS NICE.

21:42.999 --> 21:43.999
Lemonis: DOES IT LOOK NICE?

21:43.999 --> 21:45.999
Anthony: I THINK IT'S FANCY.

21:45.999 --> 21:47.999
I JUST THINK IT'S PRETTY.

21:47.999 --> 21:50.999
Lemonis: TRUTHFULLY,

21:47.999 --> 21:50.999
WHICH ONE CAN YOU REALLY READ?

21:50.999 --> 21:52.999
Anthony: THE TOP ONE.

21:50.999 --> 21:52.999
TOP LEFT.

21:52.999 --> 21:53.999
IT'S THE ONE JOSH DID.

21:53.999 --> 21:55.999
Lemonis:

21:53.999 --> 21:55.999
AND SO, YOU GOT IN HERE

21:55.999 --> 21:56.999
AND STARTED CHANGING

21:55.999 --> 21:56.999
THE ARTWORK.

21:56.999 --> 21:59.999
THE OUTCOME IS,

21:56.999 --> 21:59.999
EVEN IF THE CUSTOMER LIKES IT,

21:59.999 --> 22:00.999
IT'S BAD FOR THEIR BUSINESS.

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
THEY CAN'T SEE IT.

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
YOU'RE NOT A DESIGNER.

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
YOU'RE NOT AN ARTIST.

22:06.999 --> 22:09.999
LET EVERYBODY DO THEIR JOB.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.999
YESTERDAY, A CUSTOMER CAME IN,

22:14.999 --> 22:17.999
AND ANTHONY WASN'T ABLE

22:14.999 --> 22:17.999
TO SEAL THE DEAL.

22:17.999 --> 22:20.999
SO TODAY, WE'RE GONNA GO TO THEM

22:17.999 --> 22:20.999
AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY NEED

22:20.999 --> 22:22.999
AND SEE IF WE CAN MAKE THE SALE.

22:22.999 --> 22:23.999
Josh: WE COULD

22:22.999 --> 22:23.999
DEFINITELY DO A CLOUD.

22:23.999 --> 22:25.999
ILLUMINATE THE LOGO ITSELF,

22:23.999 --> 22:25.999
THE PIRATE.

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
Anthony: WELL,

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
I WOULD DEFINITELY --

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
SORRY, JOSH, TO INTERRUPT YOU,

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
BUT IT NEEDS MORE POP.

22:29.999 --> 22:30.999
Josh: WELL,

22:29.999 --> 22:30.999
IF WE WENT WITH ILLUMINATION,

22:30.999 --> 22:32.999
YOU'D DEFINITELY GET YOUR POP.

22:32.999 --> 22:33.999
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T DO

22:32.999 --> 22:33.999
THE YELLOW FACE.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
I WOULD PROBABLY GO WITH WHITE,

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
GIVE YOU MORE CONTRAST.

22:35.999 --> 22:36.999
Anthony: YOU NEED AS MUCH

22:35.999 --> 22:36.999
CONTRAST AS POSSIBLE.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.999
Todd: BUT THEN HOW WOULD YOU DO

22:37.000 --> 22:38.999
THAT WITH THAT TYPE OF LOGO?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.999
Josh: WELL,

22:39.000 --> 22:40.999
THAT WOULD BE A CLOUD SIGN.

22:40.999 --> 22:42.999
Anthony:

22:40.999 --> 22:42.999
THIS WOULD BE THE CLOUD,

22:42.999 --> 22:43.999
AND THIS WOULD BE CUT VINYL.

22:43.999 --> 22:46.999
Josh: ONE INCH THICK, SO

22:43.999 --> 22:46.999
YOU'D BE LOOKING AT THE SAME...

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
Lemonis: LET HIM TALK.

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
Todd: SO,

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Lemonis: NO, JUST --

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
YEAH, JUST LET HIM TALK.

22:54.999 --> 22:55.999
Josh: YOU'RE LOOKING AT

22:55.999 --> 22:57.999
PROBABLY ABOUT THREE WEEKS

22:55.999 --> 22:57.999
FROM BEGINNING TO END.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.999
Anthony: I BEG TO DIFFER.

22:59.999 --> 23:00.999
WE COULD DEFINITELY

22:59.999 --> 23:00.999
KNOCK THIS SIGN OUT

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
IN A WEEK WITH NO QUESTIONS.

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
Lemonis: JOSH, DO YOU BELIEVE

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
THAT A WEEK'S POSSIBLE?

23:04.999 --> 23:06.999
Josh: NOT 100%.

23:06.999 --> 23:07.999
Todd: OKAY, NOW I'M LOST.

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
Lemonis: YOU GUYS GOT

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
TO GET YOUR STORY STRAIGHT.

23:11.999 --> 23:12.999
Anthony:

23:11.999 --> 23:12.999
IN MY EYES, YOU'RE LATE.

23:12.999 --> 23:13.999
Lemonis:

23:12.999 --> 23:13.999
I DON'T WORK FOR YOU.

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
Anthony: RIGHT.

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
AND I DON'T WORK FOR YOU.

23:15.999 --> 23:17.999
I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU WHAT

23:15.999 --> 23:17.999
IT TAKES TO PUT A SIGN TOGETHER.

23:17.999 --> 23:18.999
SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
IF YOU WERE HERE

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
A LITTLE EARLIER.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
Lemonis:

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

23:26.999 --> 23:27.999
Todd:

23:26.999 --> 23:27.999
SO, HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE?

23:27.999 --> 23:29.999
Josh: PROBABLY ABOUT THREE WEEKS

23:27.999 --> 23:29.999
FROM BEGINNING TO END.

23:29.999 --> 23:30.999
Anthony: I BEG TO DIFFER.

23:30.999 --> 23:32.999
WE COULD DEFINITELY

23:30.999 --> 23:32.999
KNOCK THIS SIGN OUT

23:32.999 --> 23:33.999
IN A WEEK WITH NO QUESTIONS.

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
Lemonis: JOSH, DO YOU BELIEVE

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
THAT A WEEK'S POSSIBLE?

23:35.999 --> 23:37.999
Josh: NOT 100%.

23:37.999 --> 23:38.999
Todd: OKAY, NOW I'M LOST.

23:38.999 --> 23:41.999
Lemonis: YOU GUYS GOT

23:38.999 --> 23:41.999
TO GET YOUR STORY STRAIGHT.

23:42.999 --> 23:44.999
Anthony: SURE.

23:42.999 --> 23:44.999
THERE YOU GO.

23:44.999 --> 23:47.999
Todd: OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GO

23:44.999 --> 23:47.999
FOR THE SMALL LETTERS.

23:47.999 --> 23:48.999
Lemonis: YOU GOT TO LET PEOPLE

23:47.999 --> 23:48.999
DO THEIR JOB.

23:48.999 --> 23:49.999
AND SO, LET JOSH DO HIS JOB.

23:49.999 --> 23:51.999
WHEN HE'S TALKING

23:49.999 --> 23:51.999
AND YOU'RE JUMPING IN

23:51.999 --> 23:53.999
AND YOU'RE JUMPING IN, IT

23:51.999 --> 23:53.999
CONFUSES THE GUY IN THE MIDDLE.

23:53.999 --> 23:54.999
Anthony: YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.999
Lemonis: HE DOESN'T KNOW

23:55.000 --> 23:56.999
WHO HE'S SUPPOSED TO LISTEN TO.

23:56.999 --> 23:58.999
-Anthony: I'M OVERWHELMING HIM.

23:56.999 --> 23:58.999
-Lemonis: YEAH.

23:58.999 --> 24:01.999
AND SO, JOSH TECHNICALLY

23:58.999 --> 24:01.999
KNOWS HIS JOB BETTER THAN --

24:01.999 --> 24:02.999
BETTER THAN YOU DO,

24:01.999 --> 24:02.999
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

24:02.999 --> 24:03.999
Anthony: OKAY.

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
Lemonis:

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
SO LET HIM DO HIS THING.

24:05.999 --> 24:08.999
-LET HIM DO HIS JOB.

24:05.999 --> 24:08.999
-Anthony: THANK YOU.

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
Todd: HOW MUCH IS THAT SIGN?

24:09.999 --> 24:13.999
Josh: UM...[ SIGHS ]

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
Anthony: JOSH,

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
I'D FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE

24:14.999 --> 24:15.999
IF YOU DIDN'T SAY A PRICE

24:15.999 --> 24:18.000
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU

24:15.999 --> 24:18.000
TO SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE FOOT.

24:18.999 --> 24:19.999
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TOO LOW,

24:18.999 --> 24:19.999
IT'S BAD BUSINESS,

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
AND IF YOU'RE TOO HIGH,

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
IT'S BAD BUSINESS.

24:21.999 --> 24:23.000
-Todd: REALLY?

24:21.999 --> 24:23.000
-Anthony: YES, SIR.

24:23.999 --> 24:25.999
Lemonis: ANTHONY CANNOT STOP

24:23.999 --> 24:25.999
HIMSELF FROM INTERRUPTING,

24:25.999 --> 24:27.999
LET ALONE THE FACT

24:27.999 --> 24:30.999
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE THE

24:27.999 --> 24:30.999
CUSTOMER A BALLPARK ESTIMATE.

24:30.999 --> 24:31.999
HE'S GOT A LOT TO LEARN.

24:31.999 --> 24:32.999
Todd: I NEED SOMETHING

24:31.999 --> 24:32.999
TO LOOK AT.

24:32.999 --> 24:33.999
Josh: I'LL GET YOU SOMETHING

24:32.999 --> 24:33.999
TO LOOK AT TOMORROW.

24:33.999 --> 24:35.999
Todd: OKAY.

24:35.999 --> 24:36.999
Anthony:

24:35.999 --> 24:36.999
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, AGAIN.

24:36.999 --> 24:37.999
I APPRECIATE IT.

24:37.999 --> 24:40.999
Todd: THANK YOU GUYS.

24:40.999 --> 24:43.999
Lemonis:

24:40.999 --> 24:43.999
I REPEATEDLY SEE ANTHONY

24:43.999 --> 24:47.999
MICROMANAGE HIS EMPLOYEES, AND

24:43.999 --> 24:47.999
HE DOESN'T SEEM OPEN TO CHANGE.

24:47.999 --> 24:48.999
SO I WANT TO GET HIM ONE-ON-ONE

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
TO FIND OUT

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
WHAT HIS ISSUE REALLY IS.

24:50.999 --> 24:54.999
YOU HAVE TO LET PEOPLE DO THEIR

24:50.999 --> 24:54.999
JOB, AND YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT.

24:54.999 --> 24:56.999
I THINK WHAT YOU NEED

24:54.999 --> 24:56.999
TO TELL ME IS,

24:56.999 --> 24:58.999
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING

24:56.999 --> 24:58.999
FOR ME TO DO?

24:58.999 --> 25:00.999
Anthony:

24:58.999 --> 25:00.999
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR MONEY.

25:00.999 --> 25:01.999
Lemonis:

25:00.999 --> 25:01.999
SO YOU DON'T NEED ANY MONEY?

25:01.999 --> 25:02.999
Anthony: I MEAN, THE MONEY'S

25:02.999 --> 25:04.000
GONNA HELP GROW

25:02.999 --> 25:04.000
THE BUSINESS MORE,

25:04.999 --> 25:06.999
BUT IF YOU SAY, "ANT, I'M NOT

25:04.999 --> 25:06.999
GIVING YOU A DAMN PENNY,

25:06.999 --> 25:07.999
BUT I'LL GIVE YOU MY BUSINESS,"

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
I'M GONNA MAKE THE MONEY

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
THAT WAY.

25:08.999 --> 25:10.999
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN

25:08.999 --> 25:10.999
REASONS WHY WE CALLED YOU,

25:10.999 --> 25:13.999
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU CAN SHOVE

25:10.999 --> 25:13.999
MORE WORK DOWN MY THROAT

25:13.999 --> 25:14.999
THAN I CAN HANDLE.

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
Lemonis: SO, REALLY,

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU

25:16.999 --> 25:18.999
IS YOU DON'T REALLY

25:16.999 --> 25:18.999
NEED ME INVOLVED

25:18.999 --> 25:20.999
UNLESS I'M GONNA GIVE YOU

25:18.999 --> 25:20.999
MY BUSINESS.

25:20.999 --> 25:23.999
YOU REALLY DON'T CARE

25:20.999 --> 25:23.999
IF WE DO A DEAL OR NOT.

25:23.999 --> 25:24.999
Anthony: NO, I CARE,

25:24.999 --> 25:27.999
BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU

25:24.999 --> 25:27.999
AS A PARTNER.

25:27.999 --> 25:29.999
WE DO NEED TO GROW

25:27.999 --> 25:29.999
BIGGER AND BETTER.

25:29.999 --> 25:30.999
Lemonis: BUT YOU HAVE MONEY

25:29.999 --> 25:30.999
IN THE BANK,

25:30.999 --> 25:31.999
SO WHAT DO YOU NEED MONEY FOR?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.999
Anthony: BECAUSE IF I BUY

25:32.000 --> 25:33.999
THE THINGS THAT I NEED,

25:33.999 --> 25:35.999
I'LL HAVE NO MONEY.

25:35.999 --> 25:36.999
Lemonis: I DIDN'T COME HERE

25:35.999 --> 25:36.999
JUST TO GIVE YOU MONEY.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.999
MY JOB IS TO HELP

25:37.000 --> 25:38.999
FIX BUSINESSES.

25:38.999 --> 25:41.999
BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT I DO

25:38.999 --> 25:41.999
OR DON'T WANT TO DO A DEAL YET.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
I'M JUST -- I DON'T KNOW YET.

25:43.999 --> 25:44.999
Anthony: I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU

25:43.999 --> 25:44.999
TO DO A DEAL.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
Lemonis: WOULD YOU BE WILLING

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
TO DO A DEAL WITH ME

25:46.999 --> 25:47.999
IF I SAID YOU'D NEVER GET

25:46.999 --> 25:47.999
MY BUSINESS?

25:50.999 --> 25:54.999
I'LL JUST HELP YOU FIX

25:50.999 --> 25:54.999
YOUR PROCESS, AND THAT'S IT?

25:54.999 --> 25:55.999
Anthony: NO.

25:55.999 --> 25:56.999
-Lemonis: YOU WOULD NOT?

25:55.999 --> 25:56.999
-Anthony: NO.

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
Lemonis: TODAY,

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
I GOT A FACEBOOK MESSAGE

26:10.999 --> 26:11.999
FROM A PREVIOUS CUSTOMER OF ASL.

26:11.999 --> 26:13.999
HE HEARD I WAS IN TOWN,

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
AND HE WANTED TO SHARE SOME

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
IMPORTANT INFORMATION

26:15.999 --> 26:16.999
ABOUT ANTHONY.

26:16.999 --> 26:17.999
HOW YOU DOING? I'M MARCUS.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.999
Jeff: JEFF HYPE.

26:17.999 --> 26:19.999
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

26:19.999 --> 26:21.999
Lemonis: HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

26:19.999 --> 26:21.999
SO, WHAT'S UP?

26:21.999 --> 26:23.999
Jeff: I WANTED TO MEET WITH YOU

26:21.999 --> 26:23.999
IN PERSON

26:23.999 --> 26:24.999
SO THAT I COULD TALK TO YOU

26:24.999 --> 26:25.999
ABOUT YOUR POTENTIAL INVESTMENT

26:24.999 --> 26:25.999
IN ASL SIGNS.

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT I WAS

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
POTENTIALLY INVESTING?

26:29.999 --> 26:32.999
Jeff: SURFSIDE BEACH, IN ITSELF,

26:29.999 --> 26:32.999
IS 2.2 MILES LONG.

26:32.999 --> 26:33.999
Lemonis: SMALL WORLD.

26:33.999 --> 26:34.999
Jeff: UNFORTUNATELY,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.999
THE OWNER OF ASL SIGNS,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.999
ANTHONY,

26:37.999 --> 26:40.999
ACTUALLY HAS A VERY BAD

26:37.999 --> 26:40.999
REPUTATION IN THIS TOWN.

26:40.999 --> 26:42.999
-Lemonis: REALLY?

26:40.999 --> 26:42.999
-Jeff: YES.

26:42.999 --> 26:44.999
HE CAME DOWN HERE

26:42.999 --> 26:44.999
WITH DADDY'S MONEY

26:44.999 --> 26:48.999
AND THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE

26:44.999 --> 26:48.999
SOMETHING THAT WAS PROFITABLE

26:48.999 --> 26:50.999
AND NEEDED HERE IN MYRTLE BEACH.

26:50.999 --> 26:54.999
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF HE

26:50.999 --> 26:54.999
KEPT HIS TEMPER UNDER CONTROL.

26:54.999 --> 26:55.999
Lemonis:

26:54.999 --> 26:55.999
AND YOU'VE USED HIM BEFORE?

26:55.999 --> 26:56.999
Jeff: I HAVE.

26:56.999 --> 27:00.999
THE WORK THAT THEY DID

26:56.999 --> 27:00.999
WAS VERY SUBPAR.

27:00.999 --> 27:03.999
THE LETTERING WAS ALL CROOKED,

27:00.999 --> 27:03.999
IT WAS BUBBLED UP.

27:03.999 --> 27:04.999
Lemonis: DID THEY TRY

27:03.999 --> 27:04.999
TO MAKE IT RIGHT?

27:04.999 --> 27:05.999
WERE THEY APOLOGETIC?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.999
Jeff: NO.

27:07.999 --> 27:09.999
Lemonis: DID YOU END UP

27:07.999 --> 27:09.999
PAYING FOR THAT SIGN?

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
Jeff:

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
WELL, HE ACTUALLY SUED ME.

27:13.999 --> 27:14.999
YES. I LOST $600.

27:14.999 --> 27:16.999
Lemonis:

27:14.999 --> 27:16.999
AND HE SUED YOU OVER $600?

27:16.999 --> 27:17.999
Jeff: EXACTLY.

27:17.999 --> 27:18.999
Lemonis: [ SCOFFS ]

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
Jeff: I DON'T THINK

27:20.999 --> 27:23.999
THAT THERE'S ANYTHING

27:20.999 --> 27:23.999
THAT CAN BE DONE

27:23.999 --> 27:26.999
TO REMOVE THE TARNISH

27:23.999 --> 27:26.999
OF HIS NAME AND HIS LIKENESS

27:26.999 --> 27:28.999
BEING ASSOCIATED

27:26.999 --> 27:28.999
WITH THAT COMPANY

27:28.999 --> 27:30.000
WITH THE REPUTATION

27:28.999 --> 27:30.000
THAT HE ALREADY HAS.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
YOU KNOW, HE'S GOTTEN UP

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
IN PEOPLE'S FACES.

27:32.999 --> 27:33.999
Lemonis: THAT'S A BIG RISK.

27:33.999 --> 27:36.999
Jeff: YEAH.

27:36.999 --> 27:37.999
Lemonis:

27:36.999 --> 27:37.999
JEFF WAS SUED BY ANTHONY,

27:37.999 --> 27:40.999
SO THEIR HISTORY HAS TO BE TAKEN

27:37.999 --> 27:40.999
INTO ACCOUNT.

27:40.999 --> 27:41.999
BUT I'VE BEEN AROUND ANTHONY,

27:41.999 --> 27:44.999
AND HEARING THIS STORY,

27:41.999 --> 27:44.999
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

27:44.999 --> 27:46.999
Anthony: TRY TO GET THEM

27:44.999 --> 27:46.999
AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
Man #3: YEAH. YOU WANT THEM ALL

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
TO BE THE SAME, OKAY?

27:48.999 --> 27:49.999
SINCE THIS IS THE TOP,

27:48.999 --> 27:49.999
THAT'S FINE.

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
IT NEEDS TO COME DOWN SOME.

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

27:51.999 --> 27:52.999
-Man #2: YEAH.

27:51.999 --> 27:52.999
-Man #3: OKAY.

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
THERE'S A LIP THERE, OKAY?

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
SHOULD BE GOOD THERE.

27:54.999 --> 27:55.999
Anthony: HEY, JOSH.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.999
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T PUT

27:56.000 --> 27:58.999
THE BOX LINE ON HERE THIS TIME?

27:58.999 --> 28:01.999
-Josh: 'CAUSE I --

27:58.999 --> 28:01.999
-Anthony: HEY! MARCUS.

28:01.999 --> 28:02.999
Lemonis: HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?

28:02.999 --> 28:04.999
-Anthony: YOU'RE LATE.

28:02.999 --> 28:04.999
-Lemonis: I'M NOT LATE.

28:04.999 --> 28:05.999
I DON'T WORK FOR YOU.

28:04.999 --> 28:05.999
YOU WORK FOR ME.

28:05.999 --> 28:07.999
Anthony:

28:05.999 --> 28:07.999
I DON'T WORK FOR YOU YET.

28:07.999 --> 28:08.999
Lemonis: ACTUALLY,

28:07.999 --> 28:08.999
AS A CUSTOMER, YOU WORK FOR ME.

28:08.999 --> 28:09.999
-Anthony: YES.

28:08.999 --> 28:09.999
-Lemonis: RIGHT.

28:09.999 --> 28:10.999
SO YOU WORK

28:09.999 --> 28:10.999
FOR EVERY CUSTOMER, RIGHT?

28:10.999 --> 28:11.999
Anthony: THAT'S CORRECT.

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
Lemonis: OKAY,

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
SO DON'T TELL ME I'M LATE.

28:13.999 --> 28:14.999
Anthony: WELL,

28:13.999 --> 28:14.999
WHEN YOU TELL ME YESTERDAY --

28:14.999 --> 28:16.999
Lemonis: DON'T TELL ME I'M LATE.

28:14.999 --> 28:16.999
WE'RE NOT PARTNERS.

28:16.999 --> 28:17.999
Anthony: DON'T YELL AT ME.

28:16.999 --> 28:17.999
DON'T YELL AT ME.

28:17.999 --> 28:18.999
Lemonis:

28:17.999 --> 28:18.999
DON'T COMMENCE THE SHOWBOATING,

28:18.999 --> 28:19.999
TELLING ME I'M LATE.

28:19.999 --> 28:20.999
Anthony:

28:19.999 --> 28:20.999
I'M NOT SHOWBOATING NOTHING.

28:20.999 --> 28:21.999
IN MY EYES, YOU'RE LATE.

28:21.999 --> 28:23.999
Lemonis:

28:21.999 --> 28:23.999
I DON'T WORK FOR YOU.

28:23.999 --> 28:25.999
Anthony: RIGHT.

28:23.999 --> 28:25.999
AND I DON'T WORK FOR YOU.

28:25.999 --> 28:26.999
Lemonis: IF YOU WANT TO START

28:25.999 --> 28:26.999
GOING AT IT THIS MORNING,

28:26.999 --> 28:27.999
-WE CAN DO IT.

28:26.999 --> 28:27.999
-Anthony: NO, NO, I'M DONE.

28:27.999 --> 28:29.999
Lemonis: 'CAUSE I'LL MAKE YOU

28:27.999 --> 28:29.999
LOOK STUPID.

28:29.999 --> 28:30.999
'CAUSE YOU'RE COMING AT ME

28:29.999 --> 28:30.999
ALREADY.

28:30.999 --> 28:31.999
Anthony:

28:30.999 --> 28:31.999
I'M NOT COMING AT YOU.

28:31.999 --> 28:33.999
YOU'RE TELLING ME

28:31.999 --> 28:33.999
ROLL UP MY SLEEVES,

28:33.999 --> 28:34.999
LET'S GET SOME WORK DONE.

28:34.999 --> 28:35.999
Lemonis:

28:34.999 --> 28:35.999
GOOD, GET YOUR WORK DONE.

28:35.999 --> 28:36.999
Anthony: WE ARE.

28:35.999 --> 28:36.999
WE'RE CRANKING ALL DAY.

28:36.999 --> 28:37.999
Lemonis: THAT'S GOOD.

28:36.999 --> 28:37.999
AWESOME. AWESOME.

28:37.999 --> 28:39.999
Anthony: I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

28:37.999 --> 28:39.999
I WANT YOU TO BE A PART OF IT.

28:39.999 --> 28:40.999
I WANT YOU TO BE

28:39.999 --> 28:40.999
A PART OF IT, MARCUS.

28:40.999 --> 28:42.999
I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT

28:40.999 --> 28:42.999
TAKES TO PUT A SIGN TOGETHER.

28:42.999 --> 28:45.999
SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU

28:42.999 --> 28:45.999
WERE HERE A LITTLE EARLIER,

28:45.999 --> 28:47.999
AND I WOULD LIKE

28:45.999 --> 28:47.999
TO SHOW YOU HOW --

28:47.999 --> 28:49.999
Lemonis:

28:47.999 --> 28:49.999
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.999
Anthony:

28:56.000 --> 28:57.999
...SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT

28:57.999 --> 28:58.999
IF YOU WERE HERE

28:57.999 --> 28:58.999
A LITTLE EARLIER.

28:58.999 --> 29:00.999
Lemonis:

28:58.999 --> 29:00.999
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

29:00.999 --> 29:01.999
I DON'T TALK TO YOU THAT WAY,

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
SO WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
THIS WAY?

29:03.999 --> 29:04.999
Anthony: I'M TRYING TO SHOW YOU

29:04.999 --> 29:06.999
SO YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS

29:04.999 --> 29:06.999
A LITTLE BIT BETTER, OKAY?

29:06.999 --> 29:09.000
'CAUSE YOU SAID YOU DON'T KNOW

29:06.999 --> 29:09.000
THE BUSINESS THAT WELL.

29:09.999 --> 29:10.999
Lemonis: I WANT TO LEARN.

29:10.999 --> 29:11.999
BUT I WANT TO LEARN

29:10.999 --> 29:11.999
FROM SOMEBODY

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
WHO ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
THE BUSINESS

29:13.999 --> 29:15.999
AND HAS A GOOD ATTITUDE

29:13.999 --> 29:15.999
ABOUT IT.

29:15.999 --> 29:16.999
Anthony:

29:15.999 --> 29:16.999
I HAVE A GREAT ATTITUDE.

29:16.999 --> 29:18.999
Lemonis: RIGHT NOW,

29:16.999 --> 29:18.999
YOUR ATTITUDE ISN'T GOOD.

29:18.999 --> 29:19.999
Anthony: I WANTED TO SHOW YOU

29:18.999 --> 29:19.999
THIS MORNING

29:19.999 --> 29:20.999
HOW WE PUT THINGS TOGETHER.

29:20.999 --> 29:21.999
Lemonis:

29:20.999 --> 29:21.999
I'M GONNA GO TAKE A WALK.

29:21.999 --> 29:23.999
Anthony: OKAY. TAKE A WALK.

29:25.999 --> 29:28.999
Lemonis: I'VE SEEN ANTHONY

29:25.999 --> 29:28.999
DISRESPECT HIS EMPLOYEES,

29:28.999 --> 29:31.999
HIS GIRLFRIEND, AND AT LEAST

29:28.999 --> 29:31.999
ONE OF HIS CUSTOMERS.

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
NOW THAT I'VE COOLED OFF,

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM

29:33.999 --> 29:37.999
ABOUT SOME OF THE ACCUSATIONS

29:33.999 --> 29:37.999
I HEARD FROM HIS CUSTOMER JEFF.

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
-IT'S A SMALL TOWN, RIGHT?

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
-Anthony: YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:39.999 --> 29:42.999
Lemonis: AND SO, IF A CUSTOMER

29:39.999 --> 29:42.999
HAS A BAD EXPERIENCE,

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
-PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
-Anthony: YEAH.

29:44.999 --> 29:46.999
Lemonis: SO,

29:44.999 --> 29:46.999
I GOT CONTACTED ON FACEBOOK

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
BY SOMEBODY THAT SAYS

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
THAT YOU GUYS SUED HIM.

29:48.999 --> 29:49.999
HIS NAME IS JEFF.

29:48.999 --> 29:49.999
JEFFREY.

29:49.999 --> 29:51.999
Kristen: YEAH.

29:51.999 --> 29:52.999
Anthony: I BENT OVER BACKWARDS

29:51.999 --> 29:52.999
FOR THAT SON OF A...

29:52.999 --> 29:55.999
Lemonis: I'M TRYING

29:52.999 --> 29:55.999
TO POINT OUT TO ANTHONY

29:55.999 --> 29:58.999
THAT HIS STYLE CAN BE ABRASIVE,

29:55.999 --> 29:58.999
BUT I'M NOT SURE HE GETS IT.

29:58.999 --> 30:01.999
QUITE FRANKLY, ALL I HEAR HIM

29:58.999 --> 30:01.999
DOING IS BLAMING EVERYBODY ELSE.

30:01.999 --> 30:03.999
AND IN THE END, HE'S GONNA BE

30:01.999 --> 30:03.999
THE ONE THAT LOSES.

30:03.999 --> 30:05.999
HE OWED ME MONEY.

30:03.999 --> 30:05.999
WE TRIED GETTING OUR MONEY.

30:05.999 --> 30:07.999
HE REFUSED TO PAY US.

30:07.999 --> 30:10.999
Lemonis: ONCE IN A WHILE,

30:07.999 --> 30:10.999
...HAPPENS, AND YOU LET IT GO.

30:10.999 --> 30:13.999
BUT YOU DO NOT WANT TO HAVE

30:10.999 --> 30:13.999
A REPUTATION IN TOWN

30:13.999 --> 30:15.999
THAT, IF YOU HIRE ASL

30:13.999 --> 30:15.999
TO DO A JOB

30:15.999 --> 30:17.999
AND THE JOB DOESN'T GO PERFECT

30:15.999 --> 30:17.999
AND THERE'S A DISCREPANCY,

30:17.999 --> 30:19.999
THE SIGN COMPANY'S

30:17.999 --> 30:19.999
JUST GONNA SUE YOU.

30:19.999 --> 30:20.999
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
Anthony: NO,

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
THAT'S NOT HOW IT HAPPENED.

30:22.999 --> 30:23.999
Lemonis: I'M NOT SAYING

30:22.999 --> 30:23.999
THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED.

30:23.999 --> 30:26.999
I'M SAYING THAT THE PERCEPTION

30:23.999 --> 30:26.999
EXISTS THAT YOU'RE AGGRESSIVE,

30:26.999 --> 30:27.999
THAT YOU'RE A KNOW-IT-ALL,

30:27.999 --> 30:29.999
THAT YOU TELL PEOPLE

30:27.999 --> 30:29.999
THAT THEY'RE WRONG,

30:29.999 --> 30:31.999
THAT YOU TELL PEOPLE,

30:29.999 --> 30:31.999
"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
AND THAT YOU SUE YOUR CUSTOMERS.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.999
RIGHT, WRONG, OR INDIFFERENT,

30:33.999 --> 30:36.999
THAT'S THEIR PERCEPTION.

30:36.999 --> 30:37.999
AS A POTENTIAL CUSTOMER,

30:37.999 --> 30:39.999
I HAVE TO WORRY

30:37.999 --> 30:39.999
THAT YOU'RE GONNA SUE ME.

30:39.999 --> 30:41.999
Anthony: WELL, MARCUS --

30:41.999 --> 30:43.999
Lemonis: AND YOU TOLD ME

30:41.999 --> 30:43.999
IN THE CAR LAST NIGHT,

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
"I DON'T WANT TO DO A DEAL

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
WITH YOU

30:45.999 --> 30:47.999
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE ME

30:45.999 --> 30:47.999
YOUR BUSINESS."

30:47.999 --> 30:49.000
Anthony:

30:47.999 --> 30:49.000
THERE'S THINGS BEHIND THAT.

30:49.999 --> 30:50.999
IT'S NOT JUST SAYING, "WELL,

30:49.999 --> 30:50.999
IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME BUSINESS,

30:50.999 --> 30:52.999
MARCUS, I DON'T WANT TO DO

30:50.999 --> 30:52.999
A DEAL WITH YOU."

30:52.999 --> 30:53.999
Lemonis:

30:52.999 --> 30:53.999
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID TO ME.

30:53.999 --> 30:55.999
YOU THINK YOU KNOW IT ALL.

30:55.999 --> 30:58.999
YOU THINK YOU HAVE

30:55.999 --> 30:58.999
ALL THE ANSWERS ALL THE TIME.

30:58.999 --> 31:00.999
IT'S ALWAYS

30:58.999 --> 31:00.999
EVERYBODY ELSE'S FAULT.

31:00.999 --> 31:01.999
Anthony: NO.

31:01.999 --> 31:02.999
Lemonis: EVERYBODY ELSE

31:01.999 --> 31:02.999
CAN'T ALWAYS BE WRONG.

31:02.999 --> 31:05.999
Anthony: BUT THERE'S SOME THINGS

31:02.999 --> 31:05.999
THAT THEY'RE NOT RIGHT ABOUT.

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
Lemonis: THIS IS ABOUT BUSINESS

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
FOR ME.

31:07.999 --> 31:08.999
Anthony:

31:07.999 --> 31:08.999
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.999
Lemonis: AND I CAME HERE TO HELP

31:09.000 --> 31:11.999
YOU FIX YOUR BUSINESS,

31:11.999 --> 31:13.999
NOT GIVE YOU A HANDOUT

31:11.999 --> 31:13.999
BY GIVING YOU MY BUSINESS.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.999
AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT

31:13.999 --> 31:16.999
THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS,

31:17.000 --> 31:18.999
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN,

31:17.000 --> 31:18.999
DON'T LIKE YOU.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
Anthony: YOU CAN'T MAKE

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
EVERYBODY HAPPY, MARCUS.

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
Lemonis: YES, YOU HAVE

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY.

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
Anthony: I TRY. I TRY, BUT I

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
CAN'T MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY.

31:24.999 --> 31:25.999
Lemonis:

31:24.999 --> 31:25.999
NOT IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE,

31:25.999 --> 31:27.999
YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE

31:25.999 --> 31:27.999
TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY,

31:27.999 --> 31:30.999
BUT IN A BUSINESS, YOU HAVE

31:27.999 --> 31:30.999
TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY.

31:30.999 --> 31:32.999
WHICH MEANS THAT SOMETIMES

31:30.999 --> 31:32.999
YOU GOT TO TAKE A PILE OF POOP

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
AND STICK IT IN YOUR MOUTH

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
AND SHUT UP.

31:34.999 --> 31:36.999
YOU CALLED ME

31:34.999 --> 31:36.999
FOR THE WRONG REASON.

31:36.999 --> 31:39.999
-Anthony: YOU THINK SO?

31:36.999 --> 31:39.999
-Lemonis: I KNOW SO.

31:39.999 --> 31:40.999
YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE.

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
Anthony:

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
NO, I DO WANT TO CHANGE.

31:42.999 --> 31:43.999
IF I DIDN'T WANT TO CHANGE,

31:42.999 --> 31:43.999
I WOULDN'T HAVE START DOING --

31:43.999 --> 31:45.000
Lemonis:

31:43.999 --> 31:45.000
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CONVINCE ME.

31:45.999 --> 31:49.000
I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR

31:45.999 --> 31:49.000
CUSTOMER, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

31:49.999 --> 31:53.000
I'VE GOTTEN AN INSIDE VIEW,

31:49.999 --> 31:53.000
FROM THE GUTS INSIDE OUT.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.999
AND YOU TOLD MY CREW

31:53.999 --> 31:55.999
THAT IF I OFFERED YOU A CHECK,

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
IF YOU'D TAKE IT.

31:57.999 --> 31:58.999
Anthony:

31:57.999 --> 31:58.999
YEAH, BECAUSE I WANT --

31:58.999 --> 32:01.999
Lemonis: WELL, GOOD NEWS.

31:58.999 --> 32:01.999
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ONE.

32:05.999 --> 32:08.999
I HOPE THAT YOU GUYS

32:05.999 --> 32:08.999
LEARN THIS LESSON.

32:08.999 --> 32:11.999
YOU HAVE POTENTIAL. IT'S NOT

32:08.999 --> 32:11.999
ABOUT BEING THE BIGGEST.

32:11.999 --> 32:13.999
-Anthony: RIGHT.

32:11.999 --> 32:13.999
-Lemonis: IT'S NOT. OKAY?

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
-Anthony: MM-HMM.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
-Lemonis: THANKS.

32:15.999 --> 32:16.999
Anthony: THANK YOU.

32:15.999 --> 32:16.999
TAKE CARE.

32:21.999 --> 32:24.999
Lemonis: THERE ARE HUNDREDS

32:21.999 --> 32:24.999
OF THOUSANDS OF BUSINESS

32:24.999 --> 32:25.999
STRUGGLING IN THIS COUNTRY,

32:25.999 --> 32:28.000
AND THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM HELP

32:25.999 --> 32:28.000
AND AN INVESTMENT

32:28.999 --> 32:29.999
FROM ANYBODY, LET ALONE ME.

32:29.999 --> 32:31.999
BUT ANTHONY DIDN'T CALL ME

32:29.999 --> 32:31.999
FOR HELP,

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
AND HE DIDN'T CALL ME

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
FOR A PARTNERSHIP.

32:33.999 --> 32:35.999
HE CALLED ME

32:33.999 --> 32:35.999
FOR A PIECE OF MY BUSINESS.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.999
WELL, THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.999
THIS IS JUST ONE THAT

32:37.999 --> 32:40.999
I WAS NOT GONNA DO A DEAL WITH.

32:40.999 --> 32:42.999
Anthony:

32:40.999 --> 32:42.999
I WAS ACTUALLY SHOCKED.

32:42.999 --> 32:43.999
I DIDN'T THINK

32:42.999 --> 32:43.999
HE WAS GONNA DO THAT.

32:43.999 --> 32:46.999
I MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES.

32:43.999 --> 32:46.999
I APOLOGIZE TO ALL OF YOU.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.999
LITTLE UPSET

32:46.999 --> 32:48.999
BECAUSE MARCUS KICKED ME

32:48.999 --> 32:50.999
RIGHT IN MY ASS,

32:48.999 --> 32:50.999
AND I NEEDED IT.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
I NEEDED THIS.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
INSIDE.

32:58.999 --> 32:59.999
Lemonis: ...THE FOLLOW-UP --

32:59.999 --> 33:00.999
THE DEAL THAT I HAD

32:59.999 --> 33:00.999
TO WALK AWAY FROM.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.999
TRUST AND INTEGRITY

33:01.000 --> 33:03.999
ARE EVERYTHING TO ME.

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
I'M NOT GONNA DO

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
BUSINESS WITH YOU.

33:06.999 --> 33:08.999
AND MAYBE A SHOT

33:06.999 --> 33:08.999
FOR A SECOND CHANCE.

33:08.999 --> 33:09.999
Sharla:

33:08.999 --> 33:09.999
I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
THAT I WAS [SNIFFLES] UNETHICAL.

33:11.999 --> 33:13.000
I STARTED LOOKING BACK

33:11.999 --> 33:13.000
AT EVERYTHING YOU SAID

33:13.999 --> 33:15.999
AND THOUGHT, "I'M GONNA FIGURE

33:13.999 --> 33:15.999
OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS RIGHT."

33:20.000 --> 33:22.999
Lemonis: EVERY TIME

33:20.000 --> 33:22.999
I GO TO A NEW BUSINESS,

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
I GO WITH THE INTENTION

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
TO MAKE IT WORK.

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
LIKE ASL SIGNS,

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
NOT EVERY DEAL WORKS OUT.

33:26.999 --> 33:29.999
BUT SOME MAY DESERVE

33:26.999 --> 33:29.999
A SECOND CHANCE, LIKE THIS ONE.

33:29.999 --> 33:33.999
I TOLD YOU THAT TRUST AND

33:29.999 --> 33:33.999
INTEGRITY ARE EVERYTHING TO ME.

33:33.999 --> 33:34.999
QUITE FRANKLY, YOU BLEW IT.

33:34.999 --> 33:37.999
THAT'S SHARLA McBRIDE.

33:37.999 --> 33:38.999
SHARLA MAKES GOURMET POPCORN

33:38.999 --> 33:41.999
OUT OF A SMALL SHOP

33:38.999 --> 33:41.999
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

33:41.999 --> 33:44.999
SHE SOLD HER POPCORN

33:41.999 --> 33:44.999
AT DISNEYLAND

33:44.999 --> 33:46.000
AND OUT OF THREE

33:44.999 --> 33:46.000
CONCESSION TRAILERS.

33:46.999 --> 33:47.999
GOOD MORNING.

33:46.999 --> 33:47.999
I'M MARCUS.

33:47.999 --> 33:48.999
Sharla: HOW ARE YOU?

33:47.999 --> 33:48.999
NICE TO MEET YOU.

33:48.999 --> 33:50.999
Lemonis: WHEN I FIRST MET SHARLA

33:48.999 --> 33:50.999
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,

33:51.000 --> 33:52.999
HER COMPANY, PLANET POPCORN,

33:52.999 --> 33:55.999
WAS GENERATING ABOUT

33:52.999 --> 33:55.999
$2.5 MILLION IN REVENUE.

33:55.999 --> 33:59.999
DESPITE LOW OVERHEAD, SHE WAS

33:55.999 --> 33:59.999
STILL UNABLE TO MAKE A PROFIT.

33:59.999 --> 34:02.999
-WHERE'S ACCOUNTING?

33:59.999 --> 34:02.999
-Sharla: SHE'S COUNTING.

34:02.999 --> 34:03.999
Lemonis:

34:02.999 --> 34:03.999
NO, WHERE'S ACCOUNTING?

34:03.999 --> 34:06.999
Sharla: OH, WHERE'S ACCOUNTING?

34:03.999 --> 34:06.999
UH...

34:06.999 --> 34:08.998
Lemonis:

34:06.999 --> 34:08.998
BUT I LIKED THE PRODUCT.

34:08.998 --> 34:10.998
OH, MY GOD.

34:08.998 --> 34:10.998
THIS IS AMAZING.

34:10.998 --> 34:11.998
Sharla: THANK YOU.

34:11.998 --> 34:12.998
Lemonis:

34:11.998 --> 34:12.998
I LOVED THE PROFIT MARGIN.

34:12.998 --> 34:14.998
THE GOAL IS TO GO FROM

34:12.998 --> 34:14.998
A $2 MILLION COMPANY

34:14.998 --> 34:16.998
TO A $10 MILLION COMPANY.

34:16.998 --> 34:20.998
AND I AGREED TO INVEST $200,000

34:16.998 --> 34:20.998
FOR 50% OF THE BUSINESS.

34:20.998 --> 34:22.998
LET'S GET TO WORK.

34:22.998 --> 34:25.998
BUT THIS WAS A BUSINESS

34:22.998 --> 34:25.998
THAT WAS WILDLY DYSFUNCTIONAL.

34:25.998 --> 34:28.998
THE PROBLEM IS,

34:25.998 --> 34:28.998
THERE'S $319,000 MISSING.

34:28.998 --> 34:30.998
WHERE IS THE CASH?

34:30.998 --> 34:32.998
Sharla: COULDN'T TELL YOU.

34:32.998 --> 34:34.998
Lemonis:

34:32.998 --> 34:34.998
THERE WERE INVENTORY ISSUES.

34:34.998 --> 34:36.998
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

34:34.998 --> 34:36.998
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

34:36.998 --> 34:38.998
THERE WERE PRODUCTION ISSUES.

34:38.998 --> 34:41.998
SHE WASN'T TRACKING

34:38.998 --> 34:41.998
OR PROTECTING HER CASH.

34:41.998 --> 34:44.998
CASH, TO ME, IS THE MOST

34:41.998 --> 34:44.998
IMPORTANT THING IN BUSINESS.

34:44.998 --> 34:47.998
AND PROTECTING IT

34:44.998 --> 34:47.998
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

34:47.998 --> 34:48.998
AND HER ACCOUNTING SYSTEM

34:48.998 --> 34:51.000
WAS LIKE NOTHING

34:48.998 --> 34:51.000
I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE.

34:51.998 --> 34:52.998
DO YOU GUYS

34:51.998 --> 34:52.998
JUST LEAVE MONEY OUT?

34:52.998 --> 34:53.998
Sharla: YES.

34:53.998 --> 34:55.998
Lemonis: THIS WOULD BE

34:53.998 --> 34:55.998
A COOL PLACE TO ROB.

34:55.998 --> 34:56.998
MY PLAN WAS SIMPLE.

34:56.998 --> 34:59.999
I WANTED HER TO OPEN UP

34:56.998 --> 34:59.999
A GOURMET-POPCORN SHOP

34:59.999 --> 35:03.999
IN A GOOD LOCATION, GOOD

34:59.999 --> 35:03.999
SYSTEMS, AND TRACK HER REVENUE.

35:03.999 --> 35:05.999
WE WERE GONNA REDESIGN

35:03.999 --> 35:05.999
HER WEBSITE

35:05.999 --> 35:07.999
AND BUILD A BUSTLING

35:05.999 --> 35:07.999
ONLINE BUSINESS.

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
WE WERE GOING TO EXPAND

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
HER PRESENCE AT DISNEY

35:10.999 --> 35:12.999
AND LIQUIDATE

35:10.999 --> 35:12.999
HER TRAILER BUSINESS.

35:12.999 --> 35:13.999
WE'RE GETTING OUT

35:12.999 --> 35:13.999
OF THE CARNIVAL BUSINESS.

35:13.999 --> 35:15.999
BUT SHARLA PUSHED BACK.

35:15.999 --> 35:17.999
Sharla: I AM NOT COMFORTABLE

35:17.999 --> 35:19.999
SELLING OFF THE CONCESSION SIDE

35:17.999 --> 35:19.999
OF MY BUSINESS.

35:19.999 --> 35:22.999
Lemonis:

35:19.999 --> 35:22.999
AND SHE WAS UNWILLING TO CHANGE.

35:22.999 --> 35:23.999
Sharla: THIS IS MY COMPANY.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.999
Lemonis:

35:23.999 --> 35:25.999
SHE EVEN WENT BEHIND MY BACK

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
TO TRY TO PURCHASE A WEBSITE

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
THAT I ALREADY OWNED.

35:27.999 --> 35:29.999
Sharla: I WANTED TO SECURE IT

35:27.999 --> 35:29.999
FOR US SO WE COULD DO THE BRAND.

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
WHAT'S -- I DON'T UNDERSTAND

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
WHAT'S WRONG.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.999
Lemonis: BUT I TOLD YOU

35:31.999 --> 35:33.999
THAT I ALREADY OWNED IT.

35:33.999 --> 35:34.999
I WALKED AWAY.

35:34.999 --> 35:35.999
I WISH YOU A LOT OF LUCK,

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
BUT I'M NOT GONNA DO BUSINESS

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
WITH YOU.

35:39.999 --> 35:40.999
AND WHEN THE SHOW AIRED,

35:40.999 --> 35:43.999
SHARLA WAS NOT ONLY DEVASTATED

35:40.999 --> 35:43.999
BY THE STORY THAT PLAYED OUT,

35:43.999 --> 35:46.999
BUT SHE LOST HER NUMBER-ONE

35:43.999 --> 35:46.999
SOURCE OF REVENUE,

35:46.999 --> 35:47.999
HER DISNEY CONTRACT.

35:47.999 --> 35:49.999
IT WAS A BIG HIT.

35:49.999 --> 35:50.999
BUT RATHER THAN GETTING ANGRY,

35:50.999 --> 35:53.999
SHE TOOK STOCK

35:50.999 --> 35:53.999
AND BEGAN MAKING CHANGES.

35:53.999 --> 35:57.000
A FEW MONTHS AGO, WE BEGAN

35:53.999 --> 35:57.000
E-MAILING AND TALKING AGAIN,

35:57.999 --> 36:00.999
WHICH IS WHY I DECIDED

35:57.999 --> 36:00.999
TO GO BACK TO PLANET POPCORN,

36:00.999 --> 36:03.999
TO SEE IF THIS IS A DEAL

36:00.999 --> 36:03.999
THAT DESERVED A SECOND LOOK.

36:03.999 --> 36:05.999
-HOW ARE YOU?

36:03.999 --> 36:05.999
-Sharla: HOW ARE YOU?

36:05.999 --> 36:07.999
-Lemonis: GOOD TO SEE YOU.

36:05.999 --> 36:07.999
-Sharla: GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.999
I BELIEVE WHEN YOU AND I MET,

36:07.999 --> 36:10.999
IT WAS QUITE DISORGANIZED.

36:10.999 --> 36:12.999
Lemonis:

36:10.999 --> 36:12.999
AND YOUR DESK WAS A MESS.

36:12.999 --> 36:13.999
Sharla:

36:12.999 --> 36:13.999
IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

36:13.999 --> 36:14.999
Lemonis: IT DOES.

36:14.999 --> 36:16.999
Sharla: I HAVE A BABYSITTER

36:14.999 --> 36:16.999
THAT KEEPS ME CLEAN.

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
-IT'S CALLED MY BOOKKEEPER.

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
-Lemonis: OKAY.

36:18.999 --> 36:19.999
Sharla:

36:18.999 --> 36:19.999
AND MY MOTHER STILL COMES IN.

36:19.999 --> 36:21.999
Lemonis:

36:19.999 --> 36:21.999
AND HOW ARE THINGS WITH MOM?

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
Sharla: GREAT. MY MOTHER AND I

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.

36:23.999 --> 36:26.999
Lemonis: HOW MUCH MONEY

36:23.999 --> 36:26.999
HAS SHE BORROWED FROM YOU?

36:26.999 --> 36:27.999
Woman: OH...I TOOK A --

36:27.999 --> 36:29.999
Sharla: NO, SHE TOOK A SECOND

36:27.999 --> 36:29.999
OUT ON HER HOUSE,

36:29.999 --> 36:31.999
AND THE TOTAL

36:29.999 --> 36:31.999
WAS ABOUT $100,000.

36:31.999 --> 36:32.999
Woman: WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

36:32.999 --> 36:35.999
I OWED $125,000 ON MY HOME,

36:32.999 --> 36:35.999
AND NOW I OWE $250-SOMETHING.

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
Lemonis:

36:35.999 --> 36:37.999
SO THAT'S MORE THAN $100,000.

36:37.999 --> 36:38.999
Woman: AND THEN

36:37.999 --> 36:38.999
SHE OWES ME $10,000

36:38.999 --> 36:39.999
FROM MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT.

36:39.999 --> 36:41.999
Lemonis: HAVE YOU PAID HER

36:39.999 --> 36:41.999
ANYTHING BACK?

36:41.999 --> 36:44.999
Sharla: YES.

36:41.999 --> 36:44.999
I'VE BEEN PAYING HER MORTGAGE,

36:44.999 --> 36:45.999
AND THAT'S HOW I PAY HER BACK.

36:45.999 --> 36:47.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

36:45.999 --> 36:47.999
THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

36:47.999 --> 36:48.999
Sharla: WANT TO SEE THE REST

36:47.999 --> 36:48.999
OF MY BEAUTIFUL OFFICE?

36:48.999 --> 36:49.999
Lemonis: YEAH.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.999
Sharla:

36:49.999 --> 36:51.999
THIS ROOM, IT WAS A MESS.

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
OUR CASH ROOM.

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
[ LAUGHS ]

36:53.999 --> 36:56.999
Lemonis: AND I DON'T SEE

36:53.999 --> 36:56.999
ANY MONEY ON THE FLOOR.

36:56.999 --> 36:58.999
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DIFFERENTLY?

36:58.999 --> 36:59.999
Sharla:

36:58.999 --> 36:59.999
I PUT IN SECURITY CAMERAS

36:59.999 --> 37:02.999
TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE CASH ROOM,

36:59.999 --> 37:02.999
AND CAMERAS IN MY TRAILERS.

37:02.999 --> 37:04.999
AT EACH LOCATION,

37:02.999 --> 37:04.999
WE HAVE A CASH FORM,

37:04.999 --> 37:06.999
AND THE MANAGER

37:04.999 --> 37:06.999
WILL "Z" OUT THE REGISTER.

37:06.999 --> 37:08.999
AND IT GOES FROM THE VENUE

37:06.999 --> 37:08.999
WE'RE AT INTO THAT SAFE,

37:08.999 --> 37:11.999
AND THEN INTO MY HANDS

37:08.999 --> 37:11.999
AND INTO THE BANK.

37:11.999 --> 37:12.999
-Lemonis: OKAY.

37:11.999 --> 37:12.999
-Sharla: IT DOESN'T STAY HERE.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.999
SO, THIS IS

37:13.000 --> 37:14.999
OUR INVENTORY SYSTEM.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.999
Lemonis:

37:14.999 --> 37:16.999
A GOOD INVENTORY SYSTEM.

37:16.999 --> 37:19.999
Sharla: THIS IS WHERE WE PACKAGE

37:16.999 --> 37:19.999
UP ALL OF OUR POPCORN.

37:19.999 --> 37:20.999
Lemonis: AND THEN YOU'LL WHAT?

37:20.999 --> 37:21.999
OPEN FROM HERE

37:20.999 --> 37:21.999
AND FILL THE ORDER FROM HERE?

37:21.999 --> 37:23.999
Sharla: YES. CORRECT.

37:23.999 --> 37:25.000
Lemonis: AND THEN THIS

37:23.999 --> 37:25.000
IS THE FINISHED GOODS?

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
Sharla: MM-HMM. AND THEN WE HAVE

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
OUR POPCORN TINS OVER THERE.

37:27.999 --> 37:29.999
Lemonis: WHAT DOES SOMETHING

37:27.999 --> 37:29.999
LIKE THIS RETAIL FOR?

37:29.999 --> 37:33.999
Sharla: THAT SIZE IS $48.

37:29.999 --> 37:33.999
THIS SIZE IS $38.

37:33.999 --> 37:35.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

37:33.999 --> 37:35.999
SO LET'S START WITH THIS ONE.

37:35.999 --> 37:36.999
WHAT DOES THE TIN COST?

37:36.999 --> 37:37.999
Sharla: $6.73.

37:37.999 --> 37:39.999
Lemonis: AND WHAT DOES THE

37:37.999 --> 37:39.999
POPCORN COST THAT GOES IN IN?

37:39.999 --> 37:40.999
Sharla: $5.

37:40.999 --> 37:42.000
Lemonis:

37:40.999 --> 37:42.000
WHAT ELSE NEEDS TO GO IN HERE?

37:42.999 --> 37:43.999
Sharla: A DIVIDER.

37:42.999 --> 37:43.999
45 CENTS.

37:43.999 --> 37:44.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

37:44.999 --> 37:46.000
Sharla: SHRINK BAND,

37:44.999 --> 37:46.000
ANOTHER 45 CENTS.

37:46.999 --> 37:47.999
STICKER, 28 CENTS.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.999
HOW MUCH DOES THE LABOR COST?

37:49.999 --> 37:50.999
Sharla: A FEW DOLLARS.

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999
Lemonis:

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999
AND SO YOU'RE RIGHT UNDER $17.

37:52.999 --> 37:53.999
THEN YOU GOT TO PAY

37:52.999 --> 37:53.999
FOR SHIPPING.

37:53.999 --> 37:56.999
Sharla: WE HAVE

37:53.999 --> 37:56.999
A FLAT-RATE SHIPPING OF $5.

37:56.999 --> 37:57.999
Lemonis: SO,

37:56.999 --> 37:57.999
WHAT ARE YOUR MARGINS?

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
SELL IT FOR $48.

37:58.999 --> 38:01.000
Sharla: IF WE SELL IT FOR $48

37:58.999 --> 38:01.000
AND IT COSTS ME...

38:01.999 --> 38:04.999
Lemonis: INCLUDING SHIPPING,

38:01.999 --> 38:04.999
CALL IT $24, $25.

38:04.999 --> 38:05.999
WHAT ARE YOUR MARGINS?

38:05.999 --> 38:06.999
Sharla: WELL, IT'S ALMOST 50%.

38:06.999 --> 38:08.999
Lemonis: THIS IS A NEW SHARLA.

38:08.999 --> 38:11.999
SHE KNOWS HER NUMBERS

38:08.999 --> 38:11.999
AND SHE'S TRACKING HER MONEY.

38:11.999 --> 38:12.999
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
SHE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
FOR THE THINGS SHE DID,

38:14.999 --> 38:16.999
AND SHE'S TURNED IT AROUND.

38:16.999 --> 38:18.999
SHARLA, WHAT HAPPENED TO DISNEY?

38:18.999 --> 38:20.999
Sharla:

38:18.999 --> 38:20.999
WHAT HAPPENED TO DISNEY?

38:20.999 --> 38:23.999
Lemonis:

38:20.999 --> 38:23.999
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ACCOUNT?

38:23.999 --> 38:24.999
IS IT FAIR TO SAY

38:24.999 --> 38:26.999
THAT THE DISNEY RELATIONSHIP

38:24.999 --> 38:26.999
JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT?

38:30.999 --> 38:32.999
Sharla: IS THAT WHAT

38:30.999 --> 38:32.999
WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT?

38:32.999 --> 38:34.999
Lemonis: IF I ASK YOU,

38:32.999 --> 38:34.999
THERE'S A REASON I'M ASKING.

38:34.999 --> 38:35.999
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT.

38:39.999 --> 38:42.999
SHARLA, YOU OKAY?

38:55.999 --> 38:57.999
Lemonis: SHARLA, YOU OKAY?

38:57.999 --> 38:59.999
Sharla: [ CLEARS THROAT ]

38:57.999 --> 38:59.999
SORRY.

39:03.999 --> 39:04.999
Lemonis: NO,

39:03.999 --> 39:04.999
I'M BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

39:04.999 --> 39:05.999
I WANT YOU TO LOOK IN MY FACE.

39:05.999 --> 39:09.999
NO ONE IS HERE TO DO ANYTHING

39:05.999 --> 39:09.999
BUT HELP YOU.

39:09.999 --> 39:12.999
Sharla: IF I HADN'T BEEN ON TV,

39:09.999 --> 39:12.999
MARCUS,

39:12.999 --> 39:15.999
I WOULD NOT BE WHERE I AM TODAY

39:12.999 --> 39:15.999
WITH MY CONTRACTS.

39:15.999 --> 39:18.999
AFTER YOU AND I MET, SOME

39:15.999 --> 39:18.999
OF THE CONTRACTS THAT I HAD...

39:18.999 --> 39:20.999
Lemonis: GOT TERMINATED.

39:20.999 --> 39:23.999
Sharla: ...WERE TERMINATED.

39:20.999 --> 39:23.999
IT WAS A MEDIA NIGHTMARE.

39:23.999 --> 39:26.999
BUT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK

39:23.999 --> 39:26.999
THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME

39:26.999 --> 39:28.999
WAS BECAUSE I WAS [SNIFFLES]

39:26.999 --> 39:28.999
UNETHICAL OR DISHONEST.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.999
I STARTED LOOKING BACK

39:29.000 --> 39:32.999
AT EVERYTHING YOU SAID,

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
AND THOUGHT,

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
"OKAY, I'M NOT A LOSER.

39:34.999 --> 39:36.999
"I'M NOT A FAILURE.

39:36.999 --> 39:38.999
"THIS IS A GREAT COMPANY,

39:36.999 --> 39:38.999
AND I'M GONNA PICK IT BACK UP.

39:38.999 --> 39:40.999
"I'M GONNA PULL MYSELF BACK UP

39:38.999 --> 39:40.999
BY MY BOOT STRAPS,

39:40.999 --> 39:42.999
AND I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT

39:40.999 --> 39:42.999
HOW TO MAKE THIS RIGHT."

39:47.999 --> 39:49.999
Lemonis: WHEN I FIRST CAME

39:47.999 --> 39:49.999
TO PLANET POPCORN,

39:49.999 --> 39:51.999
THE BUSINESS NEEDED

39:49.999 --> 39:51.999
A LOT OF HELP,

39:51.999 --> 39:53.999
BUT SHARLA WASN'T WILLING

39:51.999 --> 39:53.999
TO MAKE THE CHANGES.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.999
SINCE THEN,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.999
SHE'S REFLECTED AND LEARNED.

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
AND I THINK IF YOU CAN BE

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
HUMBLE ENOUGH

39:58.999 --> 40:01.999
TO OWN UP TO YOUR MISTAKES, THEN

39:58.999 --> 40:01.999
YOU DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.999
MOST PEOPLE

40:01.999 --> 40:03.999
WILL SCRATCH THEIR HEAD,

40:03.999 --> 40:06.999
WONDERING WHY IN THE HELL

40:03.999 --> 40:06.999
WE'RE SITTING TOGETHER.

40:06.999 --> 40:09.999
IT'S VERY RARE THAT I COME BACK

40:06.999 --> 40:09.999
TO THE TABLE AGAIN.

40:09.999 --> 40:10.999
IT'S RARE.

40:10.999 --> 40:13.999
AND SO, WHY DID YOU THINK IT WAS

40:10.999 --> 40:13.999
A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO MEET?

40:13.999 --> 40:16.000
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU

40:13.999 --> 40:16.000
TO HELP YOUR BUSINESS?

40:16.999 --> 40:18.000
Sharla: I WAS HOPING

40:16.999 --> 40:18.000
YOU WOULD MAKE AN INVESTMENT.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.999
I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS

40:18.999 --> 40:21.999
ON planetpopcorn.com.

40:21.999 --> 40:24.000
Lemonis: LET ME SEE

40:21.999 --> 40:24.000
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SHOW.

40:24.999 --> 40:27.999
Sharla: I JUST BROUGHT YOU SOME

40:24.999 --> 40:27.999
INFORMATION AND SOME QUOTES.

40:27.999 --> 40:30.999
WE NEED MORE PACKAGING,

40:27.999 --> 40:30.999
I NEED EQUIPMENT.

40:30.999 --> 40:32.999
Lemonis:

40:30.999 --> 40:32.999
SO, IT'S ALMOST $50,000.

40:32.999 --> 40:34.999
WHAT WOULD I GET FOR $50,000?

40:34.999 --> 40:37.999
-Sharla: 10%.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.999
-Lemonis: 10%.

40:37.999 --> 40:39.999
YOU'RE IN THE POPCORN BUSINESS.

40:37.999 --> 40:39.999
I'M NOT.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.999
IT'S A COMMODITY.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.999
I CAN BUY IT ANYWHERE.

40:42.999 --> 40:44.999
AND SO, $50,000

40:42.999 --> 40:44.999
IS A LOT OF MONEY,

40:44.999 --> 40:47.999
ESPECIALLY IN A DEAL

40:44.999 --> 40:47.999
THAT I WALKED AWAY FROM.

40:47.999 --> 40:49.999
Sharla: HOW ABOUT 20%?

40:49.999 --> 40:52.999
Sharla: 10%, 20%,

40:49.999 --> 40:52.999
IT'S BEEN AWESOME TO SEE YOU,

40:52.999 --> 40:54.999
AND I THINK THAT YOU'VE MADE

40:52.999 --> 40:54.999
A LOT OF STRIDES --

40:54.999 --> 40:57.999
Sharla: DO YOU HAVE

40:54.999 --> 40:57.999
A NUMBER IN YOUR HEAD?

40:57.999 --> 40:59.999
Lemonis: I WOULDN'T DO IT

40:57.999 --> 40:59.999
FOR LESS THAN 50%.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.999
-Sharla: 50%?

41:02.000 --> 41:06.999
-Lemonis: YEP.

41:06.999 --> 41:07.999
Sharla: HOW ABOUT 25%?

41:07.999 --> 41:10.999
Lemonis: I'LL DO 25%

41:07.999 --> 41:10.999
IF I GET $1 A PACKAGE.

41:10.999 --> 41:13.999
Sharla: YOU WON'T GO ANY LOWER

41:10.999 --> 41:13.999
THAN 50% WITHOUT A ROYALTY?

41:13.999 --> 41:16.999
Lemonis: NO. BECAUSE I HAVE

41:13.999 --> 41:16.999
NO GUARANTEED RETURN.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.999
WHAT PERCENTAGE

41:19.999 --> 41:21.999
IS IMPORTANT TO YOU?

41:21.999 --> 41:23.999
Sharla: I WOULD LIKE TO OWN

41:21.999 --> 41:23.999
AT LEAST 60%.

41:23.999 --> 41:24.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

41:24.999 --> 41:26.000
I'LL GIVE YOU MY FINAL OFFER.

41:26.999 --> 41:29.999
I'LL DO 40%,

41:26.999 --> 41:29.999
BUT I GET 50 CENTS A BAG.

41:33.999 --> 41:35.999
Sharla: YOU HAVE A DEAL.

41:35.999 --> 41:36.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

41:36.999 --> 41:39.999
Sharla: OKAY.

41:39.999 --> 41:40.999
Lemonis:

41:39.999 --> 41:40.999
I MADE THIS DEAL WITH SHARLA

41:40.999 --> 41:41.999
BECAUSE I BELIEVE SHE'S CHANGED.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.999
BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO MAKE MONEY

41:41.999 --> 41:44.999
ON THIS DEAL.

41:44.999 --> 41:48.999
WITH MY INVESTMENT OF $50,000,

41:44.999 --> 41:48.999
I CAN MAKE A 10% ANNUAL RETURN

41:48.999 --> 41:51.999
BY ONLY SELLING 850 BAGS

41:48.999 --> 41:51.999
OF POPCORN A MONTH.

41:51.999 --> 41:53.999
IF I WERE TO PUT THAT MONEY

41:51.999 --> 41:53.999
IN A BANK,

41:53.999 --> 41:55.999
MY ANNUAL RETURN

41:53.999 --> 41:55.999
WOULD BE LESS THAN 2%.

41:55.999 --> 41:58.000
AND WHILE I'M HAPPY THAT SHARLA

41:55.999 --> 41:58.000
MADE ALL THE CHANGES,

41:58.999 --> 41:59.999
WHAT I'M REALLY HAPPY ABOUT

41:59.999 --> 42:01.999
IS THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE

41:59.999 --> 42:01.999
A LOT OF MONEY

42:01.999 --> 42:02.999
SELLING A LOT OF POPCORN.

42:05.999 --> 42:08.999
SHARLA, THE FACT THAT I...

42:17.999 --> 42:21.999
Sharla: [ SNIFFLES ]

42:17.999 --> 42:21.999
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE TOUGH.

42:21.999 --> 42:24.999
[ CHUCKLES ] NO TEARS.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
JUST...THANK YOU FOR HELPING.

42:31.999 --> 42:32.999
NOW LET'S GO MAKE MONEY.

42:32.999 --> 42:34.999
Lemonis: WE GOT TO GET IT RIGHT

42:32.999 --> 42:34.999
THIS TIME, OKAY?

42:34.999 --> 42:37.999
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO,

42:34.999 --> 42:37.999
BUT I WANT YOU TO GET IT RIGHT.

42:37.999 --> 42:38.999

42:37.999 --> 42:38.999
