00:45.378 --> 00:46.504
Hey, doll.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.513
<i>Death by shark or alligator?</i>

00:51.751 --> 00:52.945
Oh...

00:55.789 --> 00:57.086
I don't swim in the ocean.

00:57.457 --> 00:59.584
Alligators are in lakes or swamps
and marshes.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.317
But sharks are only in the ocean.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.362
You can't change the rules, Jase.
You gotta pick.

01:03.530 --> 01:06.397
The rules presume
that both deaths could occur.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.832
They can.
You can't mitigate risk to zero.

01:09.035 --> 01:13.335
I can mitigate risk to zero on shark
death if I never get into the ocean.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.197
Unless you're in a plane
that goes down in the ocean

01:15.275 --> 01:16.299
and you don't die on impact.

01:16.376 --> 01:20.073
Okay, fine. Shark. It's faster.

01:20.146 --> 01:26.847
Alligators drown you before they eat you.
So, there. Shark. Okay?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.080
- You happy?
- Yes.

01:28.888 --> 01:29.877
You wanna come up?

01:30.957 --> 01:32.549
- Is Katherine there?
- Yeah.

01:32.725 --> 01:35.489
- Then, no thank you.
- No, it's fine. Come up. She...

01:38.698 --> 01:40.097
I'm going to break up with her
soon anyway.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.322
Really? Already?

01:41.534 --> 01:43.764
<i>- I give it like three weeks.
- Poor Katherine.</i>

01:44.304 --> 01:47.671
She'll be fine. She's got a great

01:47.740 --> 01:49.002
sense of humor.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.134
- You're such an asshole.
- I know.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.905
<i>- You have a problem.
- I have many.</i>

01:53.046 --> 01:55.708
I blame my parents.
Why are you whispering by the way?

01:56.249 --> 01:58.911
Oh, there's a guy in my bed.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.818
What? Doll, that's great.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.726
No, it's not. He's like eleven.
He's a bartender. What is wrong with me?

02:08.061 --> 02:10.551
Nothing. It's been like years, hasn't it?

02:10.729 --> 02:12.095
<i>- Six months and a week.
- Exactly.</i>

02:12.232 --> 02:14.996
It's not natural.
Doll, you gotta sweep out the cobwebs.

02:15.368 --> 02:16.562
Thank you for that.

02:16.836 --> 02:17.894
From your vagina.

02:18.004 --> 02:19.130
Got it.

02:19.439 --> 02:22.499
<i>- I think you should come up.
- No, it's okay.</i>

02:22.942 --> 02:25.376
I'm just gonna take a pill.
I'll see you tonight, yeah?

02:25.678 --> 02:27.305
All right. Is it all of us?

02:27.514 --> 02:31.644
Yeah, it's the six of us, and Katherine.
Unless you break up with her before then.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.881
<i>- Okay.
- Keep me posted.</i>

02:34.020 --> 02:35.009
- Night, doll.
- Night.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.334
Thank you. Okay.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.577
Yeah, that's fine. Just make it a breakfast.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.160
Can you hold that, please?

03:18.965 --> 03:20.694
- Gotta stop meeting like this.
- Hi, doll.

03:20.767 --> 03:21.825
Hi.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.675
Did you have to wear those shoes?

03:29.742 --> 03:31.937
- Do you feel inadequate?
- Do you feel enormous?

03:32.011 --> 03:33.000
Fuck you.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.014
<i>- Thank you.
- Thank you.</i>

03:38.117 --> 03:40.483
Well done, doll.
Did you do this through your boss?

03:40.553 --> 03:43.545
Yep. And I only had to blow him
like three times.

03:43.623 --> 03:44.612
And that guy, twice.

03:49.596 --> 03:50.654
- Hello!
- Hi.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.425
- Hi, beauty.
- You look so pretty.

03:52.498 --> 03:53.624
You look gorgeous.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.597
I think we both look terrific.

03:55.835 --> 03:57.325
How are you? Good to see you.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.461
You're all glowy.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.870
- I love touching your face.
- I love it when you do.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.077
Jase, where's Katherine?
Is she meeting you here?

04:07.313 --> 04:08.302
Well...

04:08.715 --> 04:09.704
- No!
- Seriously?

04:09.849 --> 04:11.476
I don't know. I don't know.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.415
- Poor Kath.
- What?

04:16.122 --> 04:18.055
I forget, what do they say
about commitment issues?

04:18.124 --> 04:19.954
Is it you hated your mom,
you wanted sex with your mom?

04:20.226 --> 04:21.591
- Come on...
- I think it's hate your mom.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.925
I thought it was that you're afraid
your mom's gonna cut your penis off.

04:23.997 --> 04:24.986
Okay.

04:31.638 --> 04:32.662
No!

04:34.807 --> 04:37.367
Thank you all very, very much. Thank you.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.105
Can I just point out that
Jule can't get to a second date.

04:40.179 --> 04:42.511
Oh, that's not fair, that is not fair.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.948
I'm trying, I went to the last setup
from this one, brutal...

04:46.019 --> 04:48.749
Wait, your message got cut off.
You didn't like Russell? He's gorgeous.

04:48.988 --> 04:50.785
- He's a criminal.
- Yeah.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.651
- White collar. You can make that work.
- Really?

04:53.826 --> 04:55.919
- Is that what it's come to?
- Come on.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.221
That is not that big of a deal.

04:57.297 --> 05:01.063
- How do you make that work?
- It is a fancy prison.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.633
So, wait, are Ben and Missy late, or...

05:04.704 --> 05:06.103
Oh, no. They're here.

05:06.539 --> 05:07.904
- What...
- They went to the bathroom...

05:08.207 --> 05:10.300
- Twenty minutes ago.
- What?

05:10.410 --> 05:11.570
- To have...
- Yes. I believe so.

05:11.678 --> 05:15.079
- Oh, my God...
- To do... I think that means this, is that...

05:15.148 --> 05:16.775
Do they have sex, like, all the time?

05:16.849 --> 05:19.215
They have sex
way more than anyone we know.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.176
Jase has sex a lot...

05:21.354 --> 05:22.787
I do, but not at that level.

05:22.855 --> 05:25.449
I mean, I've never had sex on a boat
or a piano.

05:25.525 --> 05:26.992
Not yet. Not yet you haven't.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.857
Remember at my dad's funeral?
When they had sex in that...

05:28.928 --> 05:30.190
- Hey!
- Hi!

05:30.363 --> 05:31.796
What's up, guys?

05:32.665 --> 05:33.927
- Hi.
- How's it going?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.433
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

05:35.768 --> 05:37.133
- Hi. How are you? Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

05:37.203 --> 05:38.192
Good to have you back.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.805
We ran into a couple of his friends
from work downstairs...

05:40.873 --> 05:42.033
Then we were in line,
a phone call...

05:42.108 --> 05:43.132
In the bathroom?

05:43.209 --> 05:44.733
- Who'd you run into?
- Yeah.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.169
- Our friends, Barbara and Dave.
- Dave and Barbara.

05:48.247 --> 05:49.805
- I don't know them.
- All right.

05:49.882 --> 05:51.611
- So great we're all here.
- Yeah, I know.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.673
Oh, my God.

05:52.819 --> 05:53.843
So nice...

05:58.024 --> 05:59.651
- Guys, can you believe this?
- What?

05:59.726 --> 06:02.194
Hundred bucks a plate,
and they're bringing toddlers?

06:02.628 --> 06:03.925
Are they even allowed in here?

06:03.996 --> 06:06.226
People, it's Manattan,
we're here to live the dream,

06:06.299 --> 06:07.596
leave the kiddies at home.

06:07.834 --> 06:08.994
We're pregnant.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.200
- Oh, my God, that's amazing!
- Congratulations!

06:14.240 --> 06:16.367
- That is such great news.
- That's so nice.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.909
- That's amazing!
- I know, isn't it?

06:18.678 --> 06:20.111
- Thanks, Ben.
- Sorry, we knew.

06:20.179 --> 06:22.773
They told us before. We knew
and we didn't want to say anything.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.815
- No, no. We just told them.
- We just told them.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.943
- They've been busy.
- That is amazing...

06:27.820 --> 06:30.084
Please disregard what I just said.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.714
- No, no, we hate those people, too...
- We hate them. We hate them...

06:32.792 --> 06:34.384
- We are not those people.
- These are awful people.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.690
- I don't hate them...
- I love those.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.458
We are never going to bring our kids
to a place like this.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.328
Or any fancy place.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.265
Or anywhere.
We are going to keep them at home.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.496
- You can't...
- Yeah, we're gonna be cool.

06:44.570 --> 06:48.097
Les will still be strident and I'm going
to keep drinking a lot, so...

06:48.174 --> 06:49.163
I'm kidding.

06:49.375 --> 06:50.364
I'm kidding.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.610
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.276
We're excited.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.577
Serious, you guys,
everything's gonna be the same.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.780
- Nothing's gonna change.
- Of course.

07:16.869 --> 07:20.566
I guess I need six pink and eight blue ones.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.732
<i>- So, 14 total.
- Yeah.</i>

07:21.808 --> 07:23.935
<i>- Wrapped?
- Oh, wrapped would be so great.</i>

07:24.277 --> 07:27.576
If you could do... Oh, thank you.
Hold on one sec, sorry.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.615
Thanks, Steph. Thank you.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.309
<i>- Did you say 1,400 something?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

07:37.123 --> 07:40.752
I'm gonna get back to you
after I make some tough decisions, thanks.

07:41.427 --> 07:42.416
Hi.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.095
Are you looking at what I'm looking at?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.325
Check your inbox.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.900
Okay. Hold please.

07:50.236 --> 07:51.464
Oh, my God.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.305
Wow, that is bold!

07:53.473 --> 07:55.407
Yeah, really.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.004
Really. I was eating lunch.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.200
Is that corn?

07:59.579 --> 08:01.740
But now my appetite's back, thank you.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.908
Sorry. Hey, what do you want
for your birthday, anyway?

08:05.117 --> 08:10.714
A great girl with big tits, long legs,
who isn't crazy, or neurotic, or religious.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.914
What that I can get in the next three hours?

08:13.726 --> 08:15.626
- Nespresso machine.
- Done.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.732
I'm sorry, I couldn't get them to a restaurant.
I really tried.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.166
No, whatever. It's the baby card.
They all play it.

08:23.236 --> 08:26.763
But it's not just the baby card,
it's the baby card and Brooklyn.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.500
So it's like...

08:28.574 --> 08:31.099
- It's like two cards.
- It's two cards.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.177
- I hate Brooklyn.
- Brooklyn is the new Manattan.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.541
Manattan is the new Manattan.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.173
- Nice.
- I read it.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.548
Well, at least Ben and Missy will be there.
That's big.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.280
Havert seen them since the hospital.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.111
No, can't be that long.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.458
- Werert they at that thing at the...
- Nope.

08:47.226 --> 08:48.318
Thank you.

08:48.394 --> 08:50.555
Slow painful death by disease,

08:50.630 --> 08:55.363
or watching the love of your life
die a slow painful death by disease?

08:55.434 --> 08:57.163
A. Definitely A.

08:57.904 --> 09:01.601
Much worse to be without the person
you love than to have a slow painful death.

09:01.674 --> 09:04.472
But I wouldn't make mine slow and painful,
I'd get out early.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.638
- How?
- Up the morphine drip. You?

09:07.713 --> 09:09.908
Oh, B. I'm living!

09:09.982 --> 09:13.543
You would rather watch the love of your life
die slowly and painfully?

09:13.619 --> 09:16.611
Well, it wouldn't be awesome
but better them than me.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.418
I got a lot of good years left.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.686
Are we late enough? Should we circle?

09:20.760 --> 09:22.455
Thirty-five minutes?
I think we're late enough.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.454
- Hey!
- Happy Birthday.

09:25.531 --> 09:27.590
We're not quite there yet.

09:27.934 --> 09:31.028
Cole, honey, can you just...
Please, for a moment!

09:32.104 --> 09:35.039
Alex, can you come out here
for a second, please?

09:35.107 --> 09:36.267
I'm in the bathroom!

09:36.342 --> 09:39.402
Really? Well, Jule and Jase are here,
so why don't you come out!

09:39.845 --> 09:41.779
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Alex.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.576
You know what,
can you guys watch him for a second?

09:43.649 --> 09:46.345
- Yeah, of course.
- We brought some wine, if you...

09:46.953 --> 09:48.284
Hey, Cole.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.612
- I'm gonna open one of these.
- Do that.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.185
Hey, Cole. What's up, buddy?

09:53.292 --> 09:55.123
Hey, Cole, you know what?
We brought you something.

09:55.194 --> 10:00.063
Oh, my goodness, you're huge!
And I like you tremendously!

10:01.367 --> 10:02.595
I missed you so much.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.363
Oh, my goodness! How you doing?

10:04.437 --> 10:05.699
Hey!

10:05.771 --> 10:06.863
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.338
- How you doing?
- How's it going, man?

10:08.407 --> 10:11.069
- Happy birthday, little fella.
- Thanks, haven't seen you in a while.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.299
Alex!

10:13.279 --> 10:14.678
I could use a little help,
what do you think, huh?

10:14.747 --> 10:16.612
- Maybe pick up a little bit?
- I was in the bathroom.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.673
Yeah, we know. Do you have to make it
a 45-minute production

10:18.751 --> 10:20.446
when we're having guests over? Jesus!

10:20.519 --> 10:22.316
- I was reading an article...
- Maybe you could shut the door.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.912
It's fucking toxic in here.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.824
I was airing it out!

10:26.926 --> 10:29.224
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry!

10:29.295 --> 10:32.890
- Oh, sweetie, no. Please.
- I got it, it's fine.

10:33.099 --> 10:34.566
Hon, did we get Jase a gift?

10:34.800 --> 10:37.428
Jase, we forgot.
We're gonna get it this weekend, sorry!

10:37.637 --> 10:38.968
- Oh, shit, we're gonna get something.
- It's fine.

10:39.038 --> 10:41.006
- That's Ben and Miss.
- Yeah, we haven't seen them.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.197
Ben and Missy are here.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.299
- You look good.
- Thanks, you, too.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.902
- I mean, you're... Did you...
- I lost weight.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.140
- It's fucking sweet of you to even notice.
- You did. You look good.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.307
- Really?
- Alex!

10:51.050 --> 10:53.382
Could you get the fucking door?
What are you, deaf?

10:54.286 --> 10:56.015
Did the... Did the bell ring?

10:57.156 --> 10:58.714
Are you fucking kidding me today?

10:59.158 --> 11:01.820
You want me to get it?
I'll get it, I'm doing everything else.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.460
- I might have to murder him.
- Do you want me to put the sauce on?

11:04.997 --> 11:06.362
- Hey, man.
- Hey! Oh...

11:06.432 --> 11:07.421
Yep. All day.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.196
I apologize for the 50 times
he rang the doorbell.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.434
- Hey.
- Hey, how we doing?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.733
- Hey, Troy.
- Hello.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.569
- Hey. Hi, guys.
- Hi.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.600
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.611
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry. I feel like an asshole,

11:19.679 --> 11:21.010
apparently I forgot to pick up your gift.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.708
Which was already wrapped and paid for
and two blocks from his office...

11:23.783 --> 11:26.479
- I'll get it to you tomorrow.
... still couldn't find the time to pick it up.

11:26.552 --> 11:28.486
It's a tie. You can return it.

11:28.587 --> 11:31.249
It's okay, but thanks.

11:34.393 --> 11:35.985
Wait, so who was this guy again?

11:36.062 --> 11:38.622
Oh, my God,
he was a set-up through my boss.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.290
I got there, he was 61.

11:41.067 --> 11:44.468
I'm sorry, excuse me.
Can I put him in with Katie? Do you mind?

11:44.603 --> 11:46.264
Oh, yeah, the monitor's right there.
Go ahead.

11:46.338 --> 11:47.327
He's fine.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.672
- My God, he's fine. He'll be fine.
- I'll put him in there. He'll fall asleep.

11:51.977 --> 11:52.966
He's hungry.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.608
That's his hungry cry. Just go feed him.

11:55.815 --> 11:57.510
Why don't you feed him?

11:58.451 --> 11:59.918
I brought the bottle,
why don't you feed him for once?

11:59.985 --> 12:02.749
Fine, I'll feed him!
It's not like it's that big a deal.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.347
She acts like I raped her to have a kid.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.730
So, Jase, how's work?

12:17.169 --> 12:18.500
Oh, fine.

12:18.971 --> 12:21.701
- We're doing the Bud Super Bowl spots.
- Excuse me.

12:21.974 --> 12:23.874
- Pretty cool.
- That is cool.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.940
And that's my cue.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.748
My turn, clearly...

12:30.816 --> 12:32.374
- You need help, sweetie?
- No, no, I'm all right.

12:35.855 --> 12:36.947
How's Callie?

12:37.757 --> 12:40.658
Oh, we... We broke up.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.725
- No...
- Like, four months ago.

12:46.632 --> 12:47.621
Oh...

13:22.334 --> 13:24.495
- Can we get another?
- Thank you.

13:26.605 --> 13:28.903
- Jesus Christ.
- That was unbelievable.

13:28.974 --> 13:29.963
- Seriously, though...
- God!

13:30.843 --> 13:36.804
We don't know those people.
Those people are mean, and angry, and...

13:37.082 --> 13:38.174
Mean.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.613
- When did that happen?
- I don't know.

13:40.686 --> 13:42.017
I don't know, when they had kids?

13:42.087 --> 13:45.454
- Come on, that doesn't make you mean.
- Maybe it does.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.319
Can we get a couple more?

13:47.693 --> 13:51.322
No, come on, it can't be that.
It can't be just that.

13:51.597 --> 13:54.065
- I mean, it's hard, yeah. It's got to be hard.
- Sure.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.293
You know, you go through pregnancy

13:55.367 --> 13:58.359
and it's stressful
and you're fat and cranky, and I get that.

13:58.437 --> 13:59.597
Of course.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.537
But, I'm sorry, that's what you signed on for.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.404
- Yes, you did.
- They both knew going in

14:03.475 --> 14:05.306
that it was going to be shitty
for nine or ten months.

14:05.377 --> 14:06.366
I know, right.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.675
But, then, you get a great kid at the end.
Like Cole.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.409
I know.
The having the kid part's exciting and great.

14:11.483 --> 14:13.007
Miracle of life, people bring gifts.

14:13.085 --> 14:15.349
You got visitors, the in-laws,
everyone's around,

14:15.421 --> 14:18.822
people bake things and knit little hats...

14:18.891 --> 14:20.222
Yeah,

14:20.826 --> 14:27.129
but then after all the hoopla,
nobody sleeps for what, like a year?

14:27.800 --> 14:28.892
Yeah, a year or two.

14:29.401 --> 14:30.561
Right.

14:31.737 --> 14:32.863
That'll make you mean.

14:33.405 --> 14:34.565
You know
what the hardest part is to me, though?

14:34.640 --> 14:36.631
The part I just can't wrap my brain around?

14:36.942 --> 14:38.273
The loosening of the vagina

14:38.344 --> 14:40.778
and the worry that
your guy'll never like fucking you again

14:40.846 --> 14:42.370
because it's cavernous now, and not...

14:42.882 --> 14:43.940
Sorry, go ahead.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.015
No, the hardest part, and everyone says this,

14:48.087 --> 14:52.387
is that suddenly you love this creature,
I mean, this stranger, right?

14:52.458 --> 14:54.858
Far and above the person you chose
to spend the rest of your life with.

14:54.927 --> 14:59.193
The person you chose on the planet
over absolutely everyone else to be with.

15:02.434 --> 15:06.564
But what's the alternative,
just not like your kid that much?

15:06.639 --> 15:10.006
Talk about him behind his back
and leave him out of things?

15:10.075 --> 15:11.099
Tell him he's a douchebag?

15:11.176 --> 15:15.977
No, this is my point, the setup is flawed.
I mean, think about it.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.278
At my age, even if I meet my guy,

15:18.350 --> 15:22.184
I mean, the guy I've been waiting for
my whole life, I'll have, like, what?

15:22.254 --> 15:25.348
Six months to a year of awesome
before we're plunged into babydom

15:25.424 --> 15:27.324
and then it doesn't get good again
for like five years?

15:27.393 --> 15:28.724
Yeah, if you survive it.

15:29.862 --> 15:35.425
You see? I don't know how you get to be
the most important person to your person

15:35.501 --> 15:37.025
and not miss out on having a kid.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.434
Unless you marry a divorced guy with kids.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.939
Yeah, but then you miss out on birth
and you're second best to the kids.

15:42.007 --> 15:42.996
So what are you saying?

15:43.075 --> 15:47.478
You want to be already divorced, with a kid,
so you can meet the man of your dreams?

15:51.450 --> 15:53.680
Actually, divorced people
have it kind of great.

15:53.752 --> 15:57.051
They get all the toxic unsexy stuff
out of the way with the first person,

15:57.122 --> 15:59.147
and then when they meet the person
they really want to be with,

15:59.224 --> 16:01.158
they only have to deal with the kid
half the time.

16:01.393 --> 16:02.485
Right, built-in child care.

16:02.561 --> 16:05.496
Right, they get all kinds of time together
when the kid's with the ex,

16:05.564 --> 16:08.897
then they get QT with the kid
because it's special.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.096
- Right. It's like the perfect setup.
- Or you could just not have kids.

16:12.237 --> 16:15.764
- Oh, I want them so much, don't you?
- Are you kidding? Of course, I do.

16:16.141 --> 16:20.202
- I'm gonna have a kid no matter what.
- Well, me, too. At least one.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.045
Thanks.

16:23.582 --> 16:26.415
- Why don't we just do it?
- Do what?

16:26.485 --> 16:29.579
- Have a kid. Get it over with.
- What?

16:29.655 --> 16:33.887
We love each other, we trust each other,
we're responsible, gainfully employed,

16:33.959 --> 16:37.360
and totally not
attracted to each other physically.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.397
Yeah, that'd be perfect, beat the system.

16:39.465 --> 16:42.628
Right. We have the kid,
share all the responsibility,

16:42.701 --> 16:45.397
and just skip over the whole
marriage and divorce nightmare.

16:45.471 --> 16:48.201
I mean, you don't really have
a lot of time to waste, doll.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.605
Get to it, pop one out,
lose the weight quickly,

16:50.676 --> 16:52.439
then start looking for your guy.

16:55.581 --> 16:58.744
I can't really tell if you're kidding right now.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.879
Yes?

17:04.323 --> 17:05.847
- What if I wasrt?
- What?

17:06.392 --> 17:07.950
- Kidding.
- Really?

17:08.292 --> 17:10.056
Just what if?

17:10.128 --> 17:12.529
Just talk it through for a sec, pro and con it.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.296
Yeah, just spitball.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.800
I never got that expression,

17:17.869 --> 17:22.102
how do you go from fourth grade, hitting
people in the neck with small pieces of...

17:22.407 --> 17:23.965
<i>- Off topic.
- Sorry.</i>

17:25.109 --> 17:28.602
Well, what would we tell our future people?

17:28.814 --> 17:31.977
Easy. We dated casually once or twice,
got pregnant,

17:32.051 --> 17:33.916
you wanted to keep the kid
'cause you're old.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.044
Thanks.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.419
I had no choice, so we decided
to split custody and remain friends.

17:38.490 --> 17:39.752
That makes me the villain.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.487
Okay, we both wanted a kid
but not each other,

17:42.561 --> 17:44.552
so split custody and remained friends.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.330
Better.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.562
What if I meet my guy while I'm pregnant?

17:48.634 --> 17:51.967
Then you say you're not sure whose it is.
You've been dating casually.

17:52.037 --> 17:54.938
- Then I'm a slut.
- Okay, all right.

17:55.007 --> 17:58.807
Well, then, you told the guy
whom you only slept with once, me,

17:58.877 --> 18:01.812
and I wasrt into it,
but you were and it's your body, so...

18:01.880 --> 18:05.213
You know what?
I'm not gonna find my guy till post-baby,

18:05.284 --> 18:06.342
I need to drink on dates.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.213
<i>- Really?
- Really, really.</i>

18:08.420 --> 18:10.650
- Really, really.
- Okay, look me in the eye...

18:10.722 --> 18:11.916
Oh, boy.

18:11.990 --> 18:15.619
And tell me that you will be 100%
committed to this, half the time.

18:15.694 --> 18:20.563
I will be 100% committed to this,
half the time, maybe even more.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.132
Cheers.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.505
Puts hair on your chest.

18:28.574 --> 18:30.474
Shit, what do we tell our friends?

18:30.542 --> 18:32.476
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm good on my feet.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.209
Oh, my God, are you serious?

18:35.380 --> 18:36.369
Yes.

18:36.548 --> 18:39.984
It's our dream, we've always wanted
you guys to get together!

18:40.419 --> 18:43.911
- Oh, no...
- No, we're not going to get together.

18:44.356 --> 18:45.345
They're not getting together.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.255
They're just gonna fuck one time
and have a kid.

18:47.326 --> 18:49.157
- Right?
- Yeah, pretty much.

18:49.561 --> 18:52.223
- Why do you have to call it "fucking," man?
- Oh, do we have to do this?

18:53.031 --> 18:54.760
Jule and Jase are trying
to tell us something.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.435
- Look, we really wanna have a kid.
- Yeah.

18:57.669 --> 19:01.332
We just don't want to subject that kid
to our tragic marriage.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.301
Our tragic marriage?

19:04.476 --> 19:08.173
- No, our tragic marriage.
- The one we would have.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.076
- Us.
- I mean, see,

19:10.149 --> 19:13.744
we don't want to fall into the trap
that most of our friends have...

19:16.989 --> 19:19.423
We want to do it in a way
that doesn't kill the romance and...

19:20.425 --> 19:21.756
Right.

19:24.263 --> 19:27.562
The thing is, I'm old. Is the thing.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.730
I get it.

19:29.801 --> 19:32.326
You want to have a kid, but without
all the shit that comes with marriage.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.398
- Right. Yes.
- Yes.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.668
Totally makes sense to me.

19:45.551 --> 19:49.487
You are good on your feet.
Your pitches must go great.

19:49.588 --> 19:50.919
You're welcome.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.986
Oh, my God, what about our parents?

19:55.060 --> 19:59.656
Well, your mom will cry,
and my dad will write a check.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.528
Right.

20:05.137 --> 20:08.197
- You don't think she's really upset, do you?
- No.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.939
- Why are you so upset?
- Why?

20:11.009 --> 20:15.446
- Why? Because it's an affront to us.
- To us? Like specifically to us?

20:15.514 --> 20:18.745
To all normal people
who struggle and make sacrifices

20:18.817 --> 20:22.253
and make commitments to make
a relationship work, yes, it's insulting.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.812
To us, specifically and in general.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.688
- Wow. Okay, Judge Judy.
- Judge...

20:27.960 --> 20:29.951
You don't think it's insulting
to our way of life?

20:30.162 --> 20:32.130
Our way of...

20:32.197 --> 20:33.391
What?

20:33.465 --> 20:38.425
We're not Mormons or old-timey people.
We don't exactly have a way of life, babe.

20:38.704 --> 20:41.502
- You know what I mean.
- It's a brave new world, honey.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.140
There are test-tube babies
and surrogate babies

20:44.209 --> 20:45.870
<i>and Jon & Kate Plus 8.</i>

20:45.944 --> 20:48.469
I don't think that two friends
having a kid together

20:48.547 --> 20:51.846
because it might be her last chance
is the worst thing that I ever heard.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.244
Two seconds, we'll be right back.
Two seconds.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.819
Oh, my God, that's the worst idea
I've ever heard.

20:57.889 --> 21:00.153
Oh, my God. What do we do?
What do we say?

21:00.225 --> 21:03.592
I don't know. Nothing.
I mean, we can't say anything, right?

21:03.662 --> 21:07.029
We'll be right there, you guys!
This is so exciting!

21:07.232 --> 21:09.200
- They're so fucked.
- So fucked.

21:09.401 --> 21:11.699
- They seem totally on board. Yes.
- They're on board.

21:12.137 --> 21:14.435
I mean, I get the ticking clock thing for Julie,

21:14.506 --> 21:16.235
but why do you think
Jason wants to do this?

21:16.308 --> 21:18.173
I know, I didn't even think
he wanted to have kids,

21:18.243 --> 21:20.438
but I know she wanted
to have kids eventually, but...

21:20.579 --> 21:21.568
Right.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.681
- You think he feels sorry for her?
- What? No.

21:23.882 --> 21:27.648
No, what, I mean, no.

21:27.719 --> 21:30.381
- Not just that.
- You think he feels sorry for her.

21:31.156 --> 21:34.455
Okay, maybe partly he feels sorry for her.
Is that so bad?

21:34.526 --> 21:37.962
I mean, he's got all the time in the world,
but this might be it for her.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.600
What? "It" for her?

21:42.701 --> 21:45.431
- Oh, no...
- That is so fucking insulting!

21:45.504 --> 21:47.597
- Oh, now I'm insulting?
- Yes!

21:47.673 --> 21:50.506
She's insulting, I'm insulting,
it's a terrible day for you.

21:50.575 --> 21:53.271
You're saying it's it for her.
I mean, she's not dying.

21:53.345 --> 21:57.281
Okay, well, you set her up with a guy,
what, four years ago?

21:57.349 --> 21:58.976
- Who was in prison!
- God!

21:59.051 --> 22:01.383
I'm just saying, who do we know?

22:01.453 --> 22:03.318
Who do we know, good guys,

22:03.388 --> 22:06.653
who are available and ready to commit
in their late thirties?

22:06.925 --> 22:08.256
I don't have anyone for her.

22:08.427 --> 22:10.987
It's not that hard. I mean, that's ridiculous.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.896
So we find her somebody younger,
like your age.

22:14.099 --> 22:15.157
Well that's not gonna happen.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.996
What do you mean?
That's happening right now.

22:17.302 --> 22:18.997
With us? That's different.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.538
- That's unfair.
- Why?

22:20.605 --> 22:22.937
Because, hon, when we met,
you were in your twenties.

22:23.008 --> 22:27.411
- So?
- So, 28, 22, that's hot.

22:27.479 --> 22:29.606
38, 32, not so much.

22:30.182 --> 22:34.141
Are you seriously telling me
that if we met today,

22:34.219 --> 22:35.208
it wouldn't happen?

22:36.655 --> 22:38.145
Honestly, no.

22:40.158 --> 22:41.284
Probably not.

22:41.793 --> 22:44.853
- You're a super douchebag.
- I'm kidding!

22:46.998 --> 22:49.125
- I'm kidding.
- I'm gonna strangle you!

22:49.534 --> 22:51.331
- Last question.
- Shoot.

22:52.337 --> 22:54.328
Did we decide on a method?

22:56.274 --> 23:01.211
Is it won'th trying the drunken sex thing
once or twice

23:01.346 --> 23:02.677
<i>on the off chance?</i>

23:13.058 --> 23:14.616
- He is not...
- Yeah...

23:15.961 --> 23:17.394
And that is... Okay.

23:19.531 --> 23:20.964
Sorry.

23:21.032 --> 23:23.227
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- No, no, no. I'm sorry.

23:23.301 --> 23:26.134
- It's just weird.
- I know.

23:26.204 --> 23:28.365
It's like kissing a brother, or something.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.070
- Great.
- Okay, try again.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.138
- For real.
- It's fine.

23:36.214 --> 23:37.203
Okay.

23:38.884 --> 23:42.047
Maybe we should not kiss
and just watch the porn.

23:42.454 --> 23:43.443
Little more porn.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.181
It's just sex, come on.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.783
- Just forget it's me for a second.
- Okay.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.350
- And let's do this.
- Okay.

23:51.730 --> 23:55.257
- Come on.
- Let me just dim the lights a little bit.

23:55.333 --> 23:58.700
That's better. I'm sorry I don't have big tits.
I know that's your thing.

23:58.770 --> 23:59.964
That's okay. I've seen your tits.

24:00.238 --> 24:01.705
You have? When?

24:02.207 --> 24:03.834
Streak night in college.

24:03.909 --> 24:07.470
Hamptons time-share,
in the hot tub, millennium weekend.

24:07.546 --> 24:10.174
- Oh, that was a great trip.
- It was.

24:10.382 --> 24:11.371
You're stalling.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.582
Sorry, okay.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.014
Let's just do it.

24:16.087 --> 24:19.682
Oh, I should tell you,
I'm a grower, not a shower.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.089
I know.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.756
- What?
- No, I know it gets big. Leslie told me.

24:27.566 --> 24:29.693
Alex told her. Oh, and Callie told me.

24:29.768 --> 24:31.668
- Callie told you?
- Yeah.

24:31.736 --> 24:34.534
I think she was trying
to make me feel bad or something.

24:34.606 --> 24:35.766
How?

24:35.841 --> 24:39.436
I don't know, just 'cause I didn't have
access to your big dick or something?

24:39.511 --> 24:42.344
I don't know, I didn't really get her.

24:42.747 --> 24:45.147
Really? Why didn't you ever tell me that?

24:45.217 --> 24:47.185
- I did.
- You did?

24:47.252 --> 24:48.583
I did.

24:51.890 --> 24:54.222
- Anyway. Okay.
- All right, good luck.

24:55.794 --> 24:56.988
- Here goes...
- Yes.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.367
Wow, does that move
really work on people...

25:05.437 --> 25:07.496
Are you kidding me? Seriously?

25:07.639 --> 25:08.833
Is this the way this is gonna go?

25:08.907 --> 25:11.205
That was such a... Right up there... It was...

25:11.276 --> 25:13.506
Well, yeah, we gotta
get down to business here, sweetie.

25:13.645 --> 25:14.634
It was very sudden.

25:14.813 --> 25:18.271
I'm sorry, it's just sometimes
girls need a little foreplay.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.874
- Oh, really?
- A little something.

25:19.951 --> 25:23.887
Really? Is that what girls need? Are you
going to tell me about what girls need?

25:23.955 --> 25:25.786
Sorry I said anything. Let's start again.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.415
You know I'm gonna need
to get down there at some point,

25:27.492 --> 25:28.516
if we're going to conceive a child.

25:28.593 --> 25:30.527
- I do know that. Agreed.
- All right.

25:30.729 --> 25:32.560
So may I approach the bench?

25:33.765 --> 25:34.754
Yes.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.390
Yeah? Okay.

25:42.941 --> 25:44.772
- This way? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:45.977 --> 25:50.505
You know, was this a terrible idea?
Not the thing, not the plan, but this way.

25:50.582 --> 25:51.742
Was it just not a good idea?

25:51.816 --> 25:54.717
Maybe I should just get going.
I mean, this is starting to get embarrassing.

25:54.786 --> 25:59.189
No, no, no. Please don't.
I haven't had sex in a really long time.

25:59.491 --> 26:01.254
Really? Me, too. How long?

26:02.627 --> 26:03.753
Three months.

26:06.164 --> 26:07.791
- You?
- Thursday.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.826
You are such an asshole.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.268
- God, you didn't even tell me!
- It's not a big deal.

26:13.338 --> 26:15.272
- It's kind of a big deal.
- Really?

26:15.373 --> 26:17.034
- With that waitress?
- Yeah.

26:18.677 --> 26:20.008
I bet she had big tits.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.204
- No.
- Yes, she did.

26:21.346 --> 26:24.008
- She did, they were enormous.
- Such an asshole.

26:24.215 --> 26:25.648
You're such a jerk, I hate you...

26:25.717 --> 26:30.086
Why don't you stop hitting me?
It's a pain in the ass.

26:41.366 --> 26:44.893
Let's just pretend
we're really into each other, okay?

26:46.237 --> 26:47.568
Okay.

27:00.752 --> 27:03.619
So, a life coach.
What exactly does that mean?

27:03.788 --> 27:08.282
Basically I just help people
strategize, focus, prioritize, you know?

27:08.593 --> 27:10.356
Wow, that's a mouthful.

27:11.763 --> 27:16.132
Hi, I'll have a glass of
the '93 Châteauneuf-du-Pape.

27:18.069 --> 27:19.593
I'll just get a Stella.

27:23.174 --> 27:25.165
Sorry, I have to take this.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.467
Hey.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.938
Now?

27:30.148 --> 27:33.606
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's okay.
Doctor Wong, great!

27:33.818 --> 27:37.720
Do you think this epidural
should be working better or something?

27:37.789 --> 27:39.518
Can you turn it up, do you think?

27:39.591 --> 27:41.491
Meningitis. Meningitis.

27:41.559 --> 27:43.083
Oh right, hey...

27:43.628 --> 27:44.822
Can I ask you to put some of this on?

27:44.896 --> 27:48.354
<i>We saw an ER episode
where the woman got spinal meningitis</i>

27:48.433 --> 27:51.061
because she got the germs
from the doctor's hands and died.

27:51.269 --> 27:54.363
It was really sad. I mean, it was good,
it was a strong episode, but sad...

27:54.439 --> 27:57.101
All right, we're almost there, keep pushing.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.906
Oh, my God, it really is disgusting.
It's super gross.

28:00.979 --> 28:03.140
Your vagina looks like a jellyfish.

28:04.949 --> 28:06.917
- Death by drowning or fire?
- Not now!

28:07.118 --> 28:08.415
It's crowning. Scissors.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.181
- No, no...
- Oh, no!

28:10.388 --> 28:12.720
No, Doctor, please, no episiotomy.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.157
She wants to be back in the dating pool
in six to eight weeks,

28:15.226 --> 28:17.490
so if you could just let it tear naturally...

28:17.662 --> 28:18.686
What are you doing?

28:18.797 --> 28:20.992
All right, just a few more pushes.

28:21.132 --> 28:22.360
There, keep pushing.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.967
- It's coming!
- I feel like it's coming out of my ass!

28:26.838 --> 28:27.827
Really?

28:28.373 --> 28:31.240
- Oh, my gosh, you guys.
- I know, right?

28:31.509 --> 28:32.635
Hi.

28:32.844 --> 28:34.311
Are you waving hello to us?

28:35.346 --> 28:36.335
Unbelievable.

28:36.481 --> 28:37.470
You have a baby.

28:38.583 --> 28:40.312
- It was bad.
- I know, honey, you look good...

28:40.385 --> 28:43.548
Look at him. He looks just like your father.

28:43.621 --> 28:45.816
Really? Who remembers?

28:46.391 --> 28:49.883
A widow with no grandchildren
until now remembers.

28:49.961 --> 28:53.556
Mom, Dad left us 12 years before he died,
and he remarried,

28:53.631 --> 28:56.657
you're not a widow,
that's not what "widow" means.

28:56.868 --> 28:59.632
- Hello.
- Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

28:59.704 --> 29:02.195
- Hey, Marcy.
- Hello, sweetheart.

29:02.807 --> 29:04.365
This is all very weird.

29:04.476 --> 29:05.500
Hi, Phil. Nice to see you.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.568
Elaine, how've you been?

29:07.879 --> 29:09.904
Just wish my husband was here to see this.

29:10.715 --> 29:13.809
Leslie, Alex, how are your children?

29:13.985 --> 29:17.853
- The ones born in wedlock?
- They're fine, thank you.

29:18.456 --> 29:20.651
- Who wants champagne?
- Right here.

29:20.892 --> 29:21.916
I'd love some, Alex.

29:21.993 --> 29:23.756
It seems appropriate, right?

29:24.362 --> 29:25.852
So, this is Joe.

29:27.031 --> 29:28.157
Nice job, son.

29:28.533 --> 29:29.522
Well...

29:29.801 --> 29:32.668
- Phil, give him the gift.
- Right.

29:32.737 --> 29:36.503
This is for your share, son.

29:36.708 --> 29:39.006
- Dad...
- Oh, no, no, it's fine.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.238
Of course,
it's all going to be down the middle.

29:41.312 --> 29:43.644
- So, don't worry.
- Okay, we gotta run.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.580
- Really? That's it?
- Congratulations.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.743
So you're... That's your... Okay.

29:47.819 --> 29:49.446
Gotta go check in at the hotel.

29:49.521 --> 29:50.920
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

29:51.022 --> 29:52.114
Thanks for...

29:53.625 --> 29:56.389
They are a delight. Cheers.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.092
You're really sweet.

29:59.597 --> 30:03.465
- It's a shame he got my nose.
- I know. And my weak chin.

30:03.935 --> 30:05.334
Your chirs not weak.

30:05.403 --> 30:08.634
Yes it is, I just jut it out a lot
because I'm self-conscious.

30:09.207 --> 30:12.472
- Lf I kind ofjust...
- Oh, yeah, you do.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.375
- Never noticed that before.
- Yeah.

30:14.946 --> 30:18.643
- But he got your upper lip, thank God.
- And hopefully my sense of humor.

30:18.716 --> 30:20.149
- What?
- What?

30:21.319 --> 30:23.310
Hey, how was your date, by the way?

30:24.455 --> 30:28.755
She over-French-pronounces French words.

30:30.295 --> 30:32.286
- That's terrible.
- Yeah. I needed an out.

30:33.431 --> 30:35.331
Good job.

30:35.400 --> 30:40.702
- Hey, doll, you did great.
- Thanks.

30:40.772 --> 30:43.104
- He's pretty special, huh?
- Yeah.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.400
I'm glad we did this.

30:45.844 --> 30:49.109
- Me, too.
- I think it's gonna work out really well.

31:17.609 --> 31:20.009
You can take these up to your place, right?

31:21.946 --> 31:24.881
Ski boots. Oscillating fan.

31:26.184 --> 31:27.173
Terrible luggage.

31:31.923 --> 31:32.912
You all right?

31:39.931 --> 31:40.920
Okay.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.759
- Hey.
- Oh, thank God you're here.

31:44.836 --> 31:45.860
What happened?

31:46.537 --> 31:48.471
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

31:48.539 --> 31:52.635
I did everything. I fed him, I changed him,
I burped him, I swaddled him...

31:53.011 --> 31:54.672
- Did you do the mobile?
- Mobile...

31:54.746 --> 31:57.237
- You did mobile.
- I did mobile, and the train thing,

31:57.315 --> 32:00.751
and fly like an airplane
and he's been crying like this for an hour!

32:00.818 --> 32:03.150
- I think he hates me!
- No, he doesn't hate you, sweetie.

32:03.221 --> 32:05.951
He doesn't hate anybody.
He's not a hater. Come here.

32:06.024 --> 32:09.460
He's not bright enough to be a hater
right now, his brain is like this big.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.424
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

32:11.596 --> 32:12.824
Don't say that in front of him.

32:12.964 --> 32:14.522
He's dumb as a stump right now.

32:14.599 --> 32:18.057
He can't discern the nuances of
who to hate right now. That comes later.

32:19.137 --> 32:20.195
You're okay.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.203
How did you do that?

32:28.546 --> 32:29.843
It's simple. He loves me and he hates you.

32:29.914 --> 32:31.381
- Oh, you are so mean!
- I'm joking!

32:46.931 --> 32:49.456
- Are you kidding me?
- Look.

32:49.534 --> 32:52.401
Are you kidding me? Are you re-gifting?

32:52.470 --> 32:54.097
- Yes. We have to be quiet.
- Is this for me?

32:54.172 --> 32:56.436
- No, this is temporary. So calm down.
- Is this for me?

32:56.507 --> 32:58.407
Okay. Oh, great.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.976
I can't do it. I gotta put Joe to bed.
It's my night. Let's do Tuesday.

33:02.046 --> 33:04.139
No, my kid's got tumbling practice.

33:08.252 --> 33:10.846
- What? They're enormous, right?
- They're big.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.219
But, you know, that's a good thing.

33:12.457 --> 33:15.051
What is the tits thing?
I sort of get it now, but...

33:15.226 --> 33:20.493
Look, I can explain it very simply to you.
Look at Joe right now.

33:20.965 --> 33:22.159
See how happy he is?

33:22.834 --> 33:24.734
That's as happy as he's ever going to be.

33:25.269 --> 33:26.634
Buried in tits.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.604
And your last job was?

33:28.806 --> 33:32.799
I was taking care of the most
beautiful little girl in SoHo.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.935
- Wow.
- That's wonderful.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.072
Wow.

33:40.151 --> 33:41.277
I just want to make one note.

33:41.352 --> 33:45.482
Is there anything you see, Jase,
that you want to enquire about?

33:45.556 --> 33:47.683
- Or comment on?
- Right.

33:47.925 --> 33:49.688
- No.
- No.

33:50.094 --> 33:51.152
So, do I have the job?

34:00.505 --> 34:03.531
Hey, when do you think it'll be okay
to get naked with someone?

34:03.608 --> 34:04.597
Let me see.

34:08.346 --> 34:09.677
I think we're three weeks out.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.973
- Three to four.
- Okay, thanks.

34:13.451 --> 34:14.782
Five, tops.

34:20.358 --> 34:23.793
No, we haven't seen them.
Like not once. Just e-mail.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.487
I'm amazed we're finally being invited over

34:25.563 --> 34:27.690
to witness this grand experiment
in progress.

34:27.764 --> 34:29.255
- You haven't seen Jule?
- No, can you imagine?

34:29.333 --> 34:32.962
We've had two dinner dates, and late drinks,
she calls to cancel at the last minute,

34:33.036 --> 34:34.937
literally while I'm in the cab, by the way,

34:35.005 --> 34:36.438
and I had a sitter and everything.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.338
And these are on her nights,
and I'm like, "Really?"

34:38.409 --> 34:40.342
Dude has missed the last five poker nights,

34:40.411 --> 34:41.810
and I'm like,
"I'm sorry, that's living the dream?"

34:41.879 --> 34:43.608
That's my shitty life.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.275
Seriously, I expected a lot more
out of these guys. A lot of big talk.

34:46.350 --> 34:49.808
He didn't even come Monday
when I had floor seats for the Knicks.

34:49.887 --> 34:52.253
- Fuck you, why didn't you ask me?
- Fuck you, you were in Chicago.

34:52.322 --> 34:54.085
Honey, just the floor, baby, that's it.
You got it.

34:54.158 --> 34:56.023
- How was it?
- It was amazing.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.493
I was right by Seinfeld.

34:57.562 --> 34:59.029
- Get the fuck out.
- No.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.595
Get the fuck out.

35:02.533 --> 35:05.058
- Great.
- That's funny.

35:09.207 --> 35:11.937
You know what, guys?
I think that they are really struggling.

35:12.009 --> 35:15.445
And I think they just
haven't been able to face us.

35:15.513 --> 35:16.502
Maybe.

35:16.581 --> 35:19.015
I don't think they had any idea
how hard any of this was gonna be.

35:19.083 --> 35:20.107
They had no idea.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.242
Fuck off!

35:22.120 --> 35:23.212
Troy.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.187
- He's good at that.
- No.

35:25.556 --> 35:29.754
Anyway, I think we need to be
a little more supportive. You know?

35:31.329 --> 35:33.058
Yeah, they're probably in hell.

35:33.764 --> 35:35.459
Hey!

35:36.767 --> 35:40.362
Hey, Cole. How are you,
can I take your coat?

35:40.438 --> 35:42.565
Good to see you, long time.

35:43.107 --> 35:44.938
Hi, Troy, how are you?

35:46.010 --> 35:48.706
Hi, Katie, you look so pretty.

35:48.779 --> 35:51.043
Hey, Cole, can I take your backpack?

35:51.916 --> 35:52.905
There he is.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.581
- Thank you very much.
- The place looks amazing.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.280
Something smells good.

35:57.355 --> 36:00.188
- Hey, Jase, did you remember to get...
- Of course, I did.

36:00.358 --> 36:03.054
<i>Hey, who would like to watch
Thomas the Tank Engine?</i>

36:03.261 --> 36:05.161
<i>- I do! I do!
- Thomas! Let's do this.</i>

36:05.229 --> 36:06.856
Uncle Jason is going to take you guys...

36:06.931 --> 36:08.558
- I know you want an espresso.
- Oh, please.

36:09.467 --> 36:10.661
Help yourself. We have Bloody Mary mix,

36:10.735 --> 36:14.000
mimosas, whatever you want,
I'm going to get the coffees going.

36:14.572 --> 36:17.336
Look at this!
I can't believe how big he's gotten.

36:17.408 --> 36:18.841
Nineteen weeks, can you believe?

36:19.010 --> 36:21.774
- I feel totally inadequate.
- No, don't.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.938
This is ridiculous.

36:24.382 --> 36:27.909
- Yes, sweetie, if you need sugar, cream...
- Gosh, look at you guys. Thank you...

36:27.985 --> 36:30.180
Jason made the most amazing quiches.

36:30.254 --> 36:34.247
We've got quiche Lorraine,
and spinach, too.

36:34.492 --> 36:38.485
Oh, I got it, yeah.
They're really great and hot, so dig in.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.724
- It's all right, buddy.
- Hey, Jule, can you take him?

36:40.798 --> 36:41.822
Oh, you're such a faker.

36:41.966 --> 36:43.399
Oh, you're okay.

36:43.834 --> 36:45.392
Why don't you check him?
You wanna check him?

36:45.469 --> 36:47.403
- Yeah, maybe. Do you mind?
- Yeah, sure.

36:47.471 --> 36:49.769
- Can you do it?
- Yeah, can you deal with the coffee?

36:49.840 --> 36:52.035
Yeah, I figured out the thing
I kept fucking up, it was the lever...

36:52.109 --> 36:54.373
Look at you, competent.
See how that works?

36:54.445 --> 36:57.073
Yeah, sure, it turns out
I'm much better with shit than she is.

36:58.015 --> 37:01.849
It's true. But we decided guys spend more
time crapping and puking, right?

37:01.919 --> 37:03.216
Are you kidding me?
This one goes into the bathroom

37:03.287 --> 37:04.618
with a laptop and a sandwich.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.917
I like to take my time, babe.
I like to take my time.

37:07.124 --> 37:08.614
Why are you proud of that? It's gross.

37:08.693 --> 37:10.957
So, you guys, tell me everything,
what's been happening?

37:11.429 --> 37:12.623
Let's see...

37:13.231 --> 37:18.464
Well, we've been filling out the world's most
ridiculous kindergarten application for Cole,

37:18.536 --> 37:19.594
tougher than the LSATs.

37:19.737 --> 37:23.229
- Oh, my God, really?
- It's literally 17 pages of stuff like,

37:23.507 --> 37:25.805
"What are your child's
most promising attributes?"

37:25.876 --> 37:28.970
I don't know. Pulling on his wiener
and hitting stuff all the time?

37:29.347 --> 37:30.507
Freaking out his sister.

37:31.148 --> 37:32.775
- It's just gas.
- Oh, good.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.512
Hey, Jase, how are things
with the hot Latina nanny?

37:35.853 --> 37:37.445
Thanks for sending me her Facebook page,
by the way,

37:37.521 --> 37:38.988
I jerked off to it a few times already.

37:39.357 --> 37:43.157
Wow, you are such a pig!
You're a complete pig!

37:43.227 --> 37:45.457
- You werert in the room.
- It's fine. Penelope's over.

37:45.529 --> 37:47.121
- It doesn't matter.
- What, since last night?

37:47.198 --> 37:48.392
- Yeah.
- What happened?

37:48.466 --> 37:51.833
She got needy. And she voted for Bush.
2004, actually.

37:52.837 --> 37:55.271
Damn, six weeks and out?
We could have hired her.

37:55.373 --> 37:56.806
You don't think Gladys is working out?

37:56.874 --> 38:00.640
No, I do, she just scares me a little.

38:00.711 --> 38:03.179
Doll, you didn't tell me that. Come on.

38:03.247 --> 38:05.044
- She's, like, mean to me sometimes.
- She is?

38:05.116 --> 38:07.744
- A little bit mean. Just a couple of times.
- She's gone. I'm gonna kill her.

38:07.818 --> 38:10.082
I think she just doesn't like me, exactly...

38:10.154 --> 38:12.384
Julie, when are you gonna
get back out there?

38:12.456 --> 38:16.859
- Oh, I don't know, I'm not ready yet...
- She thinks her vagina's too loose.

38:17.094 --> 38:18.857
- Jason!
- No, I do. I absolutely do.

38:18.929 --> 38:21.090
- But she's Kegeling.
- Talking about Kegeling?

38:21.265 --> 38:23.631
- What is Kegeling?
- It's exercises to strengthen your vagina.

38:23.734 --> 38:25.634
Yeah. I'm doing them constantly.
I'm doing them right now.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.565
- You can't even tell.
- I can tell.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.401
- I can see.
- You saw it, right?

38:30.141 --> 38:31.165
That was a mean Kegel.

38:31.275 --> 38:33.800
Jule, don't wait too long, 'cause I
have some serious prospects for you.

38:33.878 --> 38:35.345
Not all of them are convicts.

38:35.413 --> 38:38.348
- Oh, my God, I'm so annoyed with you.
- Fingers crossed.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.729
- I don't want to go.
- You're going. You should just go.

38:57.802 --> 39:03.570
But how lame is it that it's a lunch?
I mean, late lunch? Really?

39:03.741 --> 39:06.073
Lunch is good, lunch is low stakes.

39:06.344 --> 39:10.041
I just want to stay here, though,
and go to the park with you guys.

39:10.114 --> 39:11.513
I don't want to miss anything.

39:11.582 --> 39:13.914
We're literally going to see you
in two hours.

39:13.984 --> 39:17.784
I know, but late lunch. It's so unpromising.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.618
- You know what I think?
- What?

39:19.690 --> 39:21.954
I think late lunch
can turn into early cocktails.

39:22.326 --> 39:24.817
So you can roll into evening
if it's going well,

39:25.129 --> 39:28.064
but you also have a solid out
'cause it's just lunch.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.064
- A late lunch.
- A late lunch, yes.

39:30.201 --> 39:33.034
So, I think it's an impressive,
strategic move on his part.

39:33.304 --> 39:36.034
Wow. Thanks for saying that.

39:36.507 --> 39:37.701
All right, I'm gonna go.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.467
Good-bye. Good-bye.

39:41.746 --> 39:45.580
I will see you very soon. Bye.
Have fun with Daddy.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.210
Say bye to Mommy.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.515
Tell Mommy you hope she gets laid!

39:49.653 --> 39:51.416
Shut up! God.

39:56.861 --> 39:59.091
No, no.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.324
Holy shit.

40:01.766 --> 40:04.633
Slow down!
Okay, okay, you know what? Hey.

40:05.002 --> 40:07.664
- Okay, buddy, you just go with this, okay?
- Okay, let's sit. Can you sit?

40:08.205 --> 40:10.196
Sit. Thank you.

40:11.942 --> 40:16.072
"Daw!" That's right, bud. "Daw!"

40:16.147 --> 40:19.674
Yeah, do you want to say hi to "daw"?

40:19.984 --> 40:25.513
Well, maybe this drop-dead beautiful woman
who owns the "daw" will let you...

40:25.856 --> 40:27.050
Let you say hi...

40:27.558 --> 40:28.957
Are you serious?

40:29.026 --> 40:32.723
You're gonna hit on me with a baby?
That's terrible. Boo!

40:32.963 --> 40:35.022
- What's wrong with you?
- No, no, no, hey, I'm a free agent.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.633
I'm not married. And I wasrt hitting on you.

40:38.702 --> 40:39.726
Really?

40:39.804 --> 40:42.272
Okay, yeah, maybe I was
hitting on you. But...

40:42.473 --> 40:43.997
Thank you.

40:44.074 --> 40:48.977
To be honest,
you can't really walk around with that

40:49.046 --> 40:51.310
face and not invite that kind of comment.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.850
I'm sorry for saying that,
that was the first thing that came out.

40:53.918 --> 40:57.615
I'm not usually this inarticulate or cheesy.

40:57.688 --> 41:00.020
I'm a bit off my game. A bit off my game.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.884
- Maybe a little bit.
- Yeah.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.951
I'm sorry, do you mind if we, you know,

41:05.229 --> 41:06.890
he gets so excited when he sees a dog,
it's crazy.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.556
Yeah, of course, it's fine.

41:08.766 --> 41:10.199
Hey, buddy, do you want to see the doggy?

41:11.602 --> 41:12.591
Great dog.

41:12.903 --> 41:16.134
Yeah, he's actually my neighbor's dog.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.903
I could never ever be responsible
for another living thing.

41:19.944 --> 41:20.933
He's adorable.

41:21.078 --> 41:23.069
Thanks, yeah, I think so.

41:23.914 --> 41:26.439
Except for the nose.
He got mine, poor thing.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.183
World of pain coming.

41:28.252 --> 41:30.584
Really? I think you have a great nose.

41:31.088 --> 41:33.283
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, it's your ears I would worry about.

41:34.291 --> 41:36.088
- Really...
- I'm just kidding.

41:37.394 --> 41:38.452
What's wrong with your nose?

41:38.829 --> 41:41.127
You know,
it's just always been a thing for me, like...

41:41.198 --> 41:44.065
At certain angles, I really like
the way it looks, and others, it's like,

41:44.134 --> 41:47.194
I don't know,
it's not quite symmetrical with my chin.

41:47.271 --> 41:51.605
Wow, this is coming off very gay.
And I am straight, 100%.

41:51.675 --> 41:54.940
You should know that.
Don't let the hair product fool you.

41:55.980 --> 41:57.004
Oh, boy...

41:57.515 --> 41:59.847
- Okay, so you're not married.
- No.

41:59.917 --> 42:02.215
- You're not gay.
- No.

42:02.286 --> 42:04.049
- And you have a baby.
- Yeah.

42:04.121 --> 42:05.247
So you're divorced?

42:05.489 --> 42:08.185
No. Never married.

42:08.492 --> 42:10.926
So, did you knock up a Catholic girl, or...

42:10.995 --> 42:12.690
No, she's not religious.

42:13.664 --> 42:19.899
We're friends, and she really wanted a baby.
So, you know, this is my life now.

42:20.838 --> 42:22.931
Half the time. We split custody.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.967
- Wow. That's noble.
- Thank you.

42:27.444 --> 42:29.571
- I'm Jason, by the way. I'm sorry.
- Maryjane.

42:29.647 --> 42:31.706
Maryjane. That is a great name.

42:31.982 --> 42:34.883
- I was named after shoes.
- It's a terrible name.

42:34.952 --> 42:37.819
Just kidding. It's a good name.
It's a lovely name.

42:40.024 --> 42:42.822
Sorry, do you wanna go get coffee
with me, by any chance?

42:44.061 --> 42:47.030
Just a cup of coffee.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.892
<i>You are a pumpkin.</i>

42:51.068 --> 42:52.194
You are such a pumpkin.

42:53.938 --> 42:58.136
- So what was wrong with him?
- Nothing. He couldn't have been nicer.

42:58.742 --> 43:02.109
So just boring? Flatline?

43:02.179 --> 43:05.740
He was a nice, pleasant guy.

43:06.951 --> 43:09.818
Well, you got back out there,
and we're all real proud of you.

43:09.887 --> 43:10.911
Thank you.

43:11.088 --> 43:13.215
- Cherry popped.
- So to speak.

43:13.357 --> 43:15.552
- Oh, I have some news.
- Oh, yeah?

43:16.427 --> 43:19.624
Let me put him down,
and I can give you my full attention.

43:19.697 --> 43:21.255
It is way past bedtime.

43:21.332 --> 43:24.267
- Bye!
- Bye. Good night, buddy boy.

43:25.869 --> 43:29.202
Okay, all right, I got you. Let's go.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.064
Let's go.

43:31.342 --> 43:33.207
- Bye.
- Say good night to Daddy.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.268
- Say good night.
- Bye.

43:36.714 --> 43:39.774
- I'll be right back. I want to hear your news.
- Okay.

44:05.809 --> 44:06.798
What?

44:09.913 --> 44:11.380
Nothing, I...

44:12.916 --> 44:14.110
Just...

44:15.419 --> 44:16.977
I don't think this is so hard.

44:19.056 --> 44:20.318
You know.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.720
I mean, for me, it's been really...

44:27.865 --> 44:29.332
Really great.

44:30.267 --> 44:33.327
- You know?
- Well, maybe we just got a good one.

44:34.605 --> 44:36.596
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe.

44:37.041 --> 44:40.807
Well, we also have the advantage of...
We're not sleeping together,

44:40.878 --> 44:42.539
and we're not attracted to each other,

44:42.613 --> 44:46.208
so there's none of that sex stuff
to cloud the experience.

44:46.450 --> 44:47.439
Right.

44:47.518 --> 44:50.885
I mean, it'd be different if we were married
and I owed you something,

44:50.954 --> 44:54.219
and every time I went out,
you resented the shit out of me,

44:54.291 --> 44:57.886
and every time I commented
on how hot another woman is,

44:57.961 --> 44:59.223
you thought I was an asshole,

44:59.296 --> 45:03.824
or if I had to say you were back
at your old weight when you werert.

45:04.568 --> 45:07.264
All that stuff. We're lucky.

45:08.739 --> 45:11.708
- This is clean. Simple. You know?
- Yes, yes.

45:12.910 --> 45:15.902
So, I'm sorry, you said you had... Thank you.
You had news. What's your news?

45:16.046 --> 45:17.377
Oh, right.

45:20.617 --> 45:22.482
I think I met "the girl" today.

45:25.522 --> 45:26.511
I'm serious.

45:26.890 --> 45:30.121
That's so great. That's so great.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.290
I don't know what is wrong with me.

45:32.763 --> 45:37.223
Oh, babe. I was waiting for this to happen.

45:37.835 --> 45:38.893
You were?

45:39.169 --> 45:40.761
I mean, honey,
you can't share all that shit with someone

45:40.838 --> 45:43.204
and not get confused, you know?

45:43.273 --> 45:46.834
Right. I'm just confused. It's not like
I really want him or something, right?

45:46.910 --> 45:50.676
- No, honey. Yeah, it's Jason. You know?
- I know.

45:51.715 --> 45:53.580
Jason, who we've always found to be...

45:53.650 --> 45:55.618
- Slightly effeminate.
... kind of gay.

45:55.686 --> 45:58.519
- He's short for you.
- Yes. He's too short for me, right?

45:58.589 --> 45:59.681
Yes, yes.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.584
- You have never...
- He is too short for me, right?

46:01.658 --> 46:03.182
...dated anyone near your height.
- Is that right?

46:03.260 --> 46:05.125
Just because
it makes me feel big, you know?

46:05.195 --> 46:07.390
Makes me feel like a linebacker, you know?
Like, I have to slouch.

46:07.464 --> 46:10.228
You never go short, right?
You can't wear heels...

46:10.300 --> 46:12.200
- You can't look up and...
- Yeah. Yeah. I know.

46:13.003 --> 46:17.064
Plus he only likes hot girls with big tits.
He doesn't find me even remotely attractive.

46:17.374 --> 46:19.899
Stop it. Stop that.

46:20.511 --> 46:23.071
I got to tell you, you know what,
he's a pig when it comes to women.

46:23.147 --> 46:24.239
I know.

46:24.314 --> 46:26.282
This has got nothing to do with you.

46:26.350 --> 46:31.014
This is a guy who is a terrific friend,
and he is a disaster romantically.

46:31.088 --> 46:32.077
Yes.

46:32.189 --> 46:34.749
And plus, we just know each other too well,
you know?

46:34.825 --> 46:36.315
He's like a brother.

46:36.393 --> 46:39.487
- He's like an annoying dog of a brother.
- Right.

46:39.730 --> 46:42.494
You don't want that.
You don't want your brother.

46:42.666 --> 46:45.726
- Right. Of course not.
- Because that's... That's gross.

46:45.803 --> 46:48.271
It is gross. And I don't want him.

46:48.338 --> 46:49.737
- You don't, right? Yeah.
- I don't.

46:49.807 --> 46:52.901
I just want someone.

46:53.744 --> 46:55.678
You know, I just want somebody.

46:57.381 --> 46:59.815
It's been a really long time.

47:00.050 --> 47:02.280
I've never felt lonelier, you know.

47:02.753 --> 47:06.655
This is good. Change is good.
I'm telling you, I have at least four setups.

47:06.924 --> 47:08.118
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay?

47:08.192 --> 47:10.490
- One of which is promising.
- Okay.

47:10.561 --> 47:13.052
- Okay?
- All right. And what about the other ones?

47:14.431 --> 47:15.955
They're not as promising.

47:18.335 --> 47:23.238
If you had any idea what it was like
to look at you wearing that thing...

47:23.674 --> 47:24.698
I'm gonna head out.

47:24.775 --> 47:27.107
It makes, like, boners shoot out of my eyes.

47:27.211 --> 47:29.679
- I'm going on my date.
- Okay, bye, Jule.

47:29.947 --> 47:31.039
Sorry about that, baby.

47:31.215 --> 47:34.548
We're all men, right?
I mean, I showed up a man, I'm pretty sure.

47:34.618 --> 47:37.314
And not for nothing, but it's like,

47:37.387 --> 47:40.185
whose dick did you kiss to get
the company pen, you know what I mean?

47:40.357 --> 47:41.381
Probably.

47:48.198 --> 47:50.166
- It's fine, it's fine.
- He sounds pretty upset.

47:50.234 --> 47:51.292
No, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.

47:58.408 --> 47:59.432
I'll be right back.

47:59.543 --> 48:03.343
I got it. I'll be right in. Yes, I will.

48:04.448 --> 48:07.417
I promise. Bye. I gotta go.

48:07.584 --> 48:09.677
- Where do I...
- Go talk to your guy. Go talk to your guy.

48:09.820 --> 48:11.253
Can I throw a grenade on him?

48:11.321 --> 48:12.913
- No, because he's on your team.
- Right. How do I do that?

48:12.990 --> 48:15.424
Follow, it's showing you. It's showing you.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.326
I will do it. I will do it.

48:17.761 --> 48:21.754
You are so terrible at this. You are so bad.

48:26.370 --> 48:28.497
<i>- Did you enjoy the show?
- Oh, my God, it was amazing!</i>

48:28.572 --> 48:29.561
That MJ's really something, huh.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.006
Yeah, I had no idea
what a big deal this whole thing was.

48:32.075 --> 48:33.099
She's so great.

48:33.176 --> 48:37.272
Hey, Lewis, don't forget rehearsal tomorrow,
right? 7:00. She's right this way.

48:37.648 --> 48:39.240
- You decent?
- Yeah.

48:39.650 --> 48:41.345
Someone's here to see you.

48:41.418 --> 48:43.079
- In here?
- In here.

48:43.153 --> 48:48.250
Hey. Oh, my God, thank you very much.
Hi. Thanks so much.

48:48.325 --> 48:50.520
Is this okay that I come back here?

48:50.594 --> 48:52.459
- Yeah, of course.
- Oh, my God.

48:52.529 --> 48:56.590
Well, she's an amazing dancer,
so you can imagine how flexible she is.

48:56.667 --> 49:01.127
She literally does this position
where her legs go behind her...

49:01.204 --> 49:02.364
I don't even know how it's done.

49:02.606 --> 49:05.200
I don't understand how it's possible.

49:06.109 --> 49:08.475
Dancers are usually lithe and boyish, so...

49:08.545 --> 49:11.571
Okay, well,
get ready because here's the amazing thing.

49:11.648 --> 49:16.017
She is a skinny, flexible dancer,
with a big rack.

49:16.119 --> 49:17.882
I mean, what are the odds?

49:17.955 --> 49:20.389
- What are the odds?
- Wow, that is so great.

49:20.691 --> 49:22.022
- I know.
- Yeah.

49:22.492 --> 49:26.223
Yeah. Is she nice?
Does she have any sort of personality?

49:26.296 --> 49:28.264
Oh, the body is just the gravy.

49:28.332 --> 49:33.235
She is so cool and smart and talented,
and she doesn't want kids.

49:34.037 --> 49:35.026
She's amazing, you're gonna love her.

49:35.105 --> 49:38.302
- I can't wait for you to meet her.
- Yeah, me, too.

49:39.643 --> 49:41.440
- What was that?
- What?

49:41.878 --> 49:45.712
- Are you not okay with this?
- What?

49:45.782 --> 49:48.615
I don't know. You just seem
so unsupportive. That's so unlike you.

49:48.685 --> 49:52.382
Oh, no, no, no. She sounds...
She sounds great.

49:53.223 --> 49:55.054
She is. I can't wait for you to meet her.

49:55.225 --> 49:57.159
Me, too. Me, too.

49:57.461 --> 49:58.450
Okay.

49:58.829 --> 50:02.390
I gotta go. I'm late. So have a great night.

50:23.787 --> 50:27.188
- Hey, hey, hey, where you going?
- Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. I'm going home.

50:27.257 --> 50:28.315
No, no, no, no.

50:28.392 --> 50:32.624
- I'm just not feeling my sparkliest.
- Listen to me! Pull it together.

50:32.696 --> 50:35.631
Right now, all right? Because this is it.

50:35.699 --> 50:37.860
That guy over there,
is the Holy fucking Grail.

50:37.934 --> 50:39.094
- Okay.
- Let's go.

50:39.169 --> 50:40.227
What's the catch?

50:40.303 --> 50:43.932
There's no catch. Great guy, great dad,
very successful contractor.

50:44.074 --> 50:47.669
He just got divorced, that was in March, so
I've sort ofjust been giving it time to settle,

50:47.744 --> 50:49.871
you know, because you only get one shot
at a first impression.

50:50.147 --> 50:53.139
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my God! So sorry.

50:53.216 --> 50:55.446
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

50:55.919 --> 50:57.250
We're so sorry.

50:57.954 --> 50:59.649
No, that was me. That was...

50:59.723 --> 51:02.590
I lost my footing, and then,
I bumped into my friend Julie, here...

51:02.659 --> 51:06.026
- We were looking at the tree...
- And then slammed into me.

51:06.129 --> 51:08.859
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it is my fault.

51:08.932 --> 51:10.297
I'm very clumsy.

51:10.367 --> 51:12.801
Are you guys completely hammered already,
or what's going on?

51:13.270 --> 51:15.170
- We're not drunk. Not yet.
- No.

51:15.238 --> 51:17.638
I'm like an elephant in a china shop.

51:18.341 --> 51:20.138
Bull in a china shop.

51:20.911 --> 51:23.243
Anyhow, I am Kurt. And you are?

51:23.313 --> 51:25.508
- Julie.
- I'm Julie.

51:25.582 --> 51:26.981
Like she said.

51:29.786 --> 51:33.017
- Okay, okay.
- Is everything okay?

51:33.090 --> 51:35.320
Yeah, just a second...

51:37.160 --> 51:40.391
Okay, well, I actually have to be
at the theater at like 7:00.

51:40.464 --> 51:42.864
- Okay.
- So, I'm probably gonna head out...

51:43.800 --> 51:44.824
Hey...

51:45.535 --> 51:46.968
- Wow...
- How's it going?

51:47.137 --> 51:49.367
That... That's...

51:49.539 --> 51:50.767
It's okay.

51:51.308 --> 51:54.436
- Okay, you know what, I'll see you later.
- Yeah, yeah.

51:54.644 --> 51:58.102
I have the whole night
just like later on after this.

51:58.181 --> 52:00.046
- Okay?
- Okay.

52:00.150 --> 52:01.139
Yeah!

52:01.218 --> 52:03.778
- Bye.
- How about a kiss. Just kidding.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.089
So, what do you do?

52:06.156 --> 52:09.216
When you're not busy
crashing elementary school functions.

52:10.694 --> 52:13.720
Basically, I help this really rich guy
decide who to give his money to.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.788
Wall Street guy, looking to
clear his conscience kind of thing?

52:16.066 --> 52:18.159
Something like that, yeah. Nice guy, though.

52:18.235 --> 52:20.362
- You know, ish.
- Ish.

52:20.437 --> 52:21.426
Yeah.

52:22.539 --> 52:23.870
Oh, God...

52:24.608 --> 52:25.597
What is it?

52:25.842 --> 52:30.802
Nothing, I really just haven't had
anything like...

52:30.881 --> 52:33.372
Like this happening for me, so...

52:34.885 --> 52:37.115
So, I just... You're very... You know...

52:37.754 --> 52:40.814
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Oh, no, no.

52:42.359 --> 52:43.348
I...

52:43.860 --> 52:49.492
I mean, I can put myself together, but...
I just have good hair, you know.

52:49.699 --> 52:53.635
Put myself together and good hair,
two things.

52:54.271 --> 52:56.034
Oh, come on,
just hop in a cab and come back.

52:56.206 --> 52:58.265
You know what? We have Sunday, right?

52:58.341 --> 53:00.901
And I think that we should
just stick with that

53:00.977 --> 53:03.605
instead of ruining it
with all of these almosts, okay?

53:03.680 --> 53:04.704
But...

53:04.781 --> 53:09.047
Look, I feel like a fucking teenager
when I'm at your baby mama's apartment.

53:09.619 --> 53:12.281
<i>- Well, she's dating right now so I have to...
- No, I know.</i>

53:12.355 --> 53:15.984
You guys are super progressive
and cool and all of that shit,

53:16.059 --> 53:20.393
and I love it, it's great, but I just don't need
to know the ins and the outs of it.

53:20.797 --> 53:22.355
Okay, well...

53:23.600 --> 53:24.692
I'm coming. I'm coming.

53:24.868 --> 53:27.769
Babe, I have to go.
We are going to a gig downtown.

53:27.904 --> 53:29.394
So I'm gonna talk to you later, okay?

53:29.706 --> 53:32.504
Okay, well maybe I can meet you... Hello?

53:33.510 --> 53:34.499
Babe?

53:34.911 --> 53:36.242
Nobody ever came close?

53:36.446 --> 53:42.214
Oh, no. I had this epic nine year thing
from college with this guy Andy,

53:42.285 --> 53:44.253
but it ended,

53:44.788 --> 53:46.187
badly.

53:47.123 --> 53:51.560
I don't know. Just not much of note since.

53:51.628 --> 53:53.755
- I'm surprised.
- Oh, well.

53:54.164 --> 53:57.793
I don't get how people meet people
if it isn't through college or work.

53:57.867 --> 53:58.856
Yeah.

53:59.069 --> 54:02.835
Anyway, so how about you.
How did you meet your wife?

54:02.906 --> 54:04.601
- College. Yep.
- Right.

54:04.674 --> 54:06.574
- What could go wrong?
- Yeah.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.404
What did?

54:09.512 --> 54:12.242
You know, nothing really.
There's no big story there.

54:12.315 --> 54:13.839
We just fell out of love.

54:14.951 --> 54:17.215
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

54:17.287 --> 54:20.848
We had been going through the motions
for years, for the kids,

54:20.924 --> 54:25.793
and it just seemed like a crazy way
to spend your life, I mean,

54:25.996 --> 54:27.759
- we're not dead yet.
- Right.

54:29.933 --> 54:31.400
So look, this is me.

54:33.069 --> 54:38.302
So I can either call you a car,
or maybe you want to come up for a drink,

54:38.375 --> 54:39.501
in a real glass.

54:42.679 --> 54:47.139
I would love to, but I should go home.

54:47.550 --> 54:48.676
- You know...
- Yeah.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.815
- I have a baby.
- Okay.

54:55.892 --> 54:57.723
- But there's no guy.
- Great.

54:57.794 --> 55:00.126
I mean, there's a guy, but he's not my guy.

55:00.196 --> 55:02.858
I mean, he's a friend guy,
but I'm totally unattached.

55:02.932 --> 55:04.490
- Even better.
- Except for my kid.

55:05.502 --> 55:08.733
- Yeah, of course.
- Are you sure you still want to...

55:09.539 --> 55:12.440
Wow, do you always talk this much?

55:12.542 --> 55:14.476
Maybe. Sorry.

55:33.697 --> 55:34.994
- Morning, Gord.
- Morning.

55:35.665 --> 55:37.155
It's a great day, isn't it?

55:44.007 --> 55:45.338
Oh, my God.

55:46.443 --> 55:48.104
Wow. Someone got lucky.

55:48.878 --> 55:50.607
You have no idea.

55:51.014 --> 55:52.777
- Is he asleep?
- Yeah.

55:53.216 --> 55:55.878
This guy is amazing.

55:56.353 --> 55:58.218
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

55:58.288 --> 56:03.385
I mean, who knew there were men like this
out there in the world?

56:04.094 --> 56:06.528
- Really?
- He's like, he's a man.

56:06.596 --> 56:10.123
He's like a real, grown-up man.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.998
So the exercises paid off.

56:13.069 --> 56:14.127
The what?

56:16.606 --> 56:20.940
Oh, yes, I think so. I think it was pretty tight.

56:21.411 --> 56:25.279
- Wow, and you were so worried.
- I know, I know, I mean...

56:27.117 --> 56:32.054
Thank you. He's so big, it could be that
that just canceled out any looseness.

56:32.422 --> 56:36.324
I mean, the last guy I had sex with was you
and this was like a quantum leap size-wise,

56:36.426 --> 56:40.760
so I think it might end up being
the same tightness overall.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.392
Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean it that way.

56:46.469 --> 56:49.802
No, you were totally perfectly in proportion
to your height.

56:50.140 --> 56:51.630
Kurt's really tall, so...

56:51.841 --> 56:53.672
- Kurt, huh?
- Yeah.

56:53.743 --> 56:55.734
Is he a Nazi? Nazi basketball player?

56:56.846 --> 56:58.336
- What?
- Nothing.

56:58.415 --> 57:01.942
Oh, thank you for asking
about my night, by the way.

57:02.018 --> 57:05.249
- Joe had explosive diarrhea.
- Oh, no.

57:05.655 --> 57:06.644
Twice.

57:07.123 --> 57:09.648
I scrubbed everything with bleach,
even the baseboards,

57:09.726 --> 57:12.251
I did laundry,
and I waited up for you to come home,

57:12.328 --> 57:13.590
so I could go see my girlfriend,

57:13.663 --> 57:17.360
but I never heard from you
because you were fucking Dirk Diggler.

57:17.834 --> 57:20.928
- So...
- Wait a second.

57:21.004 --> 57:22.995
I'm sorry.

57:23.873 --> 57:26.034
- I thought I had your blessing.
- You do.

57:26.109 --> 57:28.942
You always said if I was on a date
and it was going well, to just go for it.

57:29.012 --> 57:30.775
- That's what we...
- Yeah, no, that's great.

57:30.847 --> 57:34.078
That's perfect.
A call or a text would have been nice,

57:34.150 --> 57:37.984
but I'm incredibly relieved to know
your pussy is still tight.

57:39.522 --> 57:42.980
So, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go shower, change,

57:43.159 --> 57:47.596
and try and reclaim a small shred of
my masculinity before going to work.

57:48.565 --> 57:49.827
To try and sell beer.

57:50.667 --> 57:53.192
- So, you're on duty tonight.
- Okay.

57:53.903 --> 57:55.370
- All night!
- Okay.

58:09.886 --> 58:11.478
Ski trip! Leave in 20.

58:13.356 --> 58:16.052
- You do not sound excited.
- I'm excited!

58:22.098 --> 58:24.965
No, we're good. We're gonna get
on the road in 15, 20 at the most,

58:25.034 --> 58:27.025
which basically means 45 minutes.

58:27.270 --> 58:29.704
I'm doing only slightly better myself.

58:29.906 --> 58:33.000
Honey, did you find the sled yet?

58:33.343 --> 58:34.833
I did everything you asked!

58:35.011 --> 58:36.000
<i>Thank you.</i>

58:36.079 --> 58:37.910
Oh, my God, I've been getting
really excited about this trip.

58:37.981 --> 58:40.313
<i>- I think it's gonna be fun.
- Do you think it's too soon?</i>

58:40.383 --> 58:41.714
What? With Kurt?

58:41.784 --> 58:47.279
Yeah, I mean, meeting the friends,
and Jason and dancer girl with the tits.

58:47.357 --> 58:48.585
Is this a terrible idea?

58:48.791 --> 58:50.691
Stop it, it's a great idea.

58:50.927 --> 58:52.394
<i>Kurt gets it, he's got kids.</i>

58:52.462 --> 58:53.895
- Hey.
- Oh, there's Jason.

58:54.063 --> 58:55.928
I should go. I'll call you from the road.
I love you.

58:56.099 --> 58:57.532
- Okay, babe, love you.
- Bye.

58:58.301 --> 59:01.964
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

59:02.071 --> 59:06.007
Hey, buddy, how you doing? Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

59:07.477 --> 59:09.240
I'll get it. Hello?

59:09.712 --> 59:11.703
<i>- Sorry, I must have pressed the wrong...
- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

59:11.781 --> 59:16.775
No, that's me. Hey, Kurt, it's me.
That's just Jason, my friend.

59:18.221 --> 59:21.554
My baby... Joe's dad, that's just Joe's dad.

59:21.624 --> 59:22.989
Come on up.

59:28.164 --> 59:29.188
I...

59:29.265 --> 59:31.426
So, are you guys all packed?

59:31.501 --> 59:35.665
Oh, no, not quite. MJ's still in bed.
We had a pretty late night.

59:36.439 --> 59:37.599
Right.

59:37.807 --> 59:40.207
Well, do you want us to wait for you guys,
we have room for...

59:40.276 --> 59:42.403
No, we rented a car.

59:42.478 --> 59:45.641
Thought it would be more romantic
to take our time, stop along the way.

59:45.748 --> 59:47.375
Never been on a road trip together.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.741
Right. Right. Of course.

59:55.758 --> 59:58.249
- Well, I better get going.
- Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah.

59:58.428 --> 59:59.827
- Here you go.
- Okay, bud.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.422
Okay, bud.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:02.724
- All right, I got you.
- All right.

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.061
All right, well, have a great drive.

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:05.191
- We'll see you up there.
- Thank you.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:09.304
Wow, you must be Kurt.

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:11.531
- Yeah, yeah. Hey, babe.
- Hi.

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:13.468
Boy, you were not kidding.

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:16.512
You are one extremely handsome
German man.

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:18.947
I'm actually from Long Island,
but, how are you?

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:23.550
Right. I'm Jason. This is my son.

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:25.242
- Hey, buddy.
- They know each other.

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:27.812
- Take it up top. Take it up top.
- Who's that? Who's that?

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:28.879
That hurts!

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:30.957
Oh, come here, you.

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:34.163
- Oh, I got you. I got you.
- You want Kurt? You want Kurt?

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.391
- Hey, buddy, good to see you again. Yeah.
- I know. I know.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.797
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:40.301
I'm good. Oh, it's your best friend!

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:42.001
It's your best friend!

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:43.695
- What have I got in here?
- What did you bring?

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:46.307
Look at that treat. Check that out.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.900
- Look at that.
- That's yummy.

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.171
That's so nice of you.

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:52.405
You know what, we don't actually
allow sweets this early in the day.

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:56.116
Oh, you know what,
but this is actually the fake stuff, carob.

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:57.311
It just looks like chocolate.

01:00:57.387 --> 01:01:01.448
The good thing is, he won't notice
the difference for another two years.

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:02.513
I hope that's okay.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.891
Yeah, that's fine.

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:20.206
You gonna carry the boots, Cole?

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:35.288
Pretty great, huh? What do you think, bud?

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.654
- I'm moving in. Don't tell Alex.
- I want to stay forever. Can we?

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.958
Oh, my God, look, look, look.

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:44.932
We're gonna put it right over there.
Don't get too close to that fire.

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:46.693
Do you see that?

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.834
Seriously, look at all the men.

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.898
I'm happy with all the accessories.

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:53.473
And then look at him.

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.167
- I know.
- Ready?

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:56.575
But he did that!

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:59.046
Reinforcements flying in.

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:06.349
Oh, my God. Miss, you want some... Sorry!

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:07.719
- Hey, everybody!
- Do you wanna top up?

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:09.416
- Hey!
- This is MJ.

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:10.953
Hi.

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.592
- Good God, hello.
- This is Alex right here. MJ.

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.495
- Alex. MJ.
- Hi, I'm Alex.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:18.500
- Hi, Alex. How are you?
- How are you?

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.433
- Good, nice to meet you.
- Holy God.

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:21.595
- Hey, man.
- Well done.

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:24.367
- I'm sorry about my husband. I'm Leslie.
- Hi. It's okay. Hi. How are you?

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.539
That was good help, buddy,
thank you very much.

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:27.940
- Did you meet MJ?
- Yeah, we just met.

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:29.773
- Hey, did you meet MJ?
- I did. I met her.

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:32.007
Good. Did you meet everybody?

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:33.474
Hi, I'm Ben.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.081
That's Ben over there.

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:36.982
Hi, I'm Julie.

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:38.848
- Hi, I'm MJ.
- Sorry, this is Julie.

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:40.650
This is Julie, and this is MJ.

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.918
- Nice to meet you finally.
- Of course. I've heard so much about you,

01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:47.224
I feel like I know you. I have two
of your thongs in my apartment.

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:48.285
I washed them.

01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:51.530
- Night, you guys.
- Night.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:53.732
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:54.895
I just didn't know what you were thinking,

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:57.303
if you wanted him in your room
or ours tonight.

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:01.142
Can you do me a favor
and keep him with you guys tonight?

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:06.315
It's just, she makes a lot of noise
and between that and the positions

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:10.384
that we do,
I just don't want to scare him, you know?

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.711
Right. Right. Okay.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.183
Well, sometimes we can be loud, too.

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:20.155
Okay, all right, great.
We'll take him tonight then.

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:21.757
- Great, you're the best.
- Okay.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:22.820
Good night, buddy.

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.262
- Have fun.
- Thanks a lot.

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.322
Yep.

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.277
Aneurysm or cancer?

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:45.310
- I'm sorry, what?
- Which would you choose?

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:48.081
- Neither.
- No, it's a game. You have to choose.

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:49.215
Which would you rather?

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.922
Think about it, aneurysm, it goes fast,
you don't even know it's happening,

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:59.195
which is nice, but cancer,
you get to prepare, say your goodbyes,

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:00.530
maybe write a memoir, so...

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.571
Okay, all right, in that case,
I would go with cancer.

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:03.662
Okay.

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:06.071
Right? Because with early detection
and vigilance...

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:08.667
No, no, no. You don't get it,
you don't get it. You're dying!

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.109
Right? Either way you're dying.

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:11.880
Okay, got it.

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:18.251
Why am I dying? Why is this fun?

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:21.554
Forget it.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:28.653
Look, if you want to talk about these
terribly depressing things, I'm totally game.

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:30.824
All right?
I don't want to ruin your holiday, so...

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.458
How about waterboarding,
how do you feel about that?

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.900
That's good and depressing.

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:36.996
For the record, I'm against it,
but it is depressing.

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:40.236
I'm just tired. You don't have to do anything.

01:04:40.943 --> 01:04:42.069
All right, sorry.

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:43.367
You like this?

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:44.674
- You want this?
- Thank you.

01:04:45.414 --> 01:04:46.972
Yeah, give everybody the food...

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.539
Oh, we lost one!

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:51.478
You have to eat.

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:54.316
- Honey, please.
- MJ, I should warn you, we're pretty good.

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:57.252
We used to have a ski share every winter,
so just try and keep up.

01:04:57.326 --> 01:05:01.319
I'm probably going to be boarding
just because I'm not 100, so...

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:03.064
Oh, my God.

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:04.255
Okay.

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:05.999
Stop it. Stop it.

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:08.995
Hey, are you sure this is okay?
I can do a half day,

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:11.938
- come back at 1:00 if you want?
- No, no, no, I'll ski tomorrow. It's fine.

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:13.566
- You sure?
- Yeah, it's fine.

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:16.908
Let's go, if you're skiing.
Cars are loaded up, grab your stuff, let's go.

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:19.072
Hey, Kurt, you in or out, buddy?

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:21.610
You know, I think I'm gonna stick around,
go tomorrow with Jule.

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:26.087
Besides, it looks like these guys
could use a little bit of a hand here.

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.582
Oh, God.

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.425
- Just take him, please.
- Of course, of course. I got him.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:31.824
Are you okay, sweetie?

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:38.461
- I'm sorry, is it something I said, or...
- Don't ask.

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.037
Let's go!

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:51.471
- There's no line.
- Yeah, we'll catch up.

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.942
So how 'bout the whole
Ben and Missy of it all?

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:59.351
- Jesus. How 'bout just the Ben of it all?
- Right?

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:03.051
- That is one long, bad mood.
- Yeah, no shit.

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:09.026
- Kurt seems like a nice guy, though.
- Yeah. As long as Jule's happy.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.633
MJ's great.

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:20.006
Dude, you have no idea.
I have never, ever had sex like this before.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:22.067
No, it's crazy.

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:25.511
- I mean, like, I'm sore from overuse.
- Whoa, dude...

01:06:25.681 --> 01:06:27.911
It's like hurting me just to stand here.

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:31.317
Seriously, a little sensitivity
for the have-nots, please.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.081
Sorry. What, you guys
aren't really back in the saddle?

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.886
No. No, sir.

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:41.595
It's kind of hard to hit it when you have
two kids asleep and drooling on you.

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:45.963
So, what are we talking? Like once a...

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:49.630
- Once a month, is what we're talking.
- What?

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.497
Maybe twice a month,
maybe it's not that bad.

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:55.169
- More when the grandparents visit.
- Oh, my God.

01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:56.871
- I know.
- Oh, my God.

01:06:56.946 --> 01:07:01.645
- I am so sorry, man. I had no idea.
- It's fine. It's fine. It's...

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:03.282
I feel like we're over the worst of it.

01:07:04.086 --> 01:07:06.111
I've made my peace with it.

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:09.589
Come on! You coming? Let's go!

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:13.794
Let's do this.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.104
You look beautiful, by the way.

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:31.244
Oh, my goodness, wow. Hi.

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.473
- You look great.
- Thank you.

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:36.075
I might need a moment to myself here
to think about your face and your body.

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:38.248
- Go masturbate.
- Okay...

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.481
Speaking of masturbating,
who wants some chicken?

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:42.956
- I do.
- I just love that...

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:48.293
Guys, guys, just before we all start eating.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:52.292
I just wanted to say
how glad I am that we're all here.

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:55.330
You know, old friends and new.

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:59.130
It makes me happy, nice to meet you,
young lady.

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:02.675
And Kurt, if things don't work out
with you and Jule,

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:05.145
I just want you to know that
we would like you to live with us.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.312
- Just help us raise our kids.
- Please.

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:11.884
I just want a role model
for my young boy, so...

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:14.855
But seriously, I did actually
want to make a little toast,

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.983
so if we can just raise our glasses.

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:18.752
To Jase and Jule.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:22.723
That's right. I gotta hand it to you guys,

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:26.461
a year ago not everyone thought that
this little arrangement was gonna work out.

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:33.139
But... There was talk
that it might end in tears,

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:34.640
and lawsuits,

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:38.171
and possibly some broken bones,
maybe child services being called.

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:42.313
But it has been...
It has been really impressive to watch.

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:44.447
Wow, thanks, Al.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.488
- That's lovely.
- We're proud of you.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.852
- So cheers.
- Thanks, man.

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:50.152
Yeah, thanks a lot, Al.

01:08:50.225 --> 01:08:51.420
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:53.621
- Love you guys.
- Cheers. Cheers.

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:56.130
- That was really sweet.
- You're really sweet, baby.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:59.700
So, I'm curious,
whose idea was this anyhow?

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:01.200
- It was his.
- Hers.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:02.599
- It was yours.
- It was mine?

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:03.763
- Yes.
- You're right.

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.397
She paid me $200,000

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:08.238
just so she could, like,
get involved with this gene pool.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.970
No, it was kind of mutual. Right? I mean...

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:16.843
Both wanted a kid,
and we hadrt met our people,

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:19.479
so we just decided to do it.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:22.916
The truth is they just didn't want
to end up like us.

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.015
I wonder why...

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:31.192
- Honey, don't you think you've had enough?
- No, I think I'm fine. Thank you.

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:35.560
Unbelievable.

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:44.636
- This food is amazing!
- It is good!

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:45.941
It's so moist.

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:48.345
- What is that sauce, is that mushrooms?
- It's amazing.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.714
I threw mushrooms in there.

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:53.551
So, have you guys thought about what
you're gonna tell Joe when he gets older?

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.214
I mean, I'm sure you're going to have to deal
with some of the same issues

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:58.317
- that I'm dealing with right now.
- What do you mean?

01:09:58.427 --> 01:10:00.395
How do you explain to your kids

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:03.022
that their parents
want to be with other people,

01:10:03.098 --> 01:10:05.396
and all of the sort of
conflicting theories on that.

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:06.456
Right.

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:09.503
I probably don't need to tell you, you
probably already did exhaustive research

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:13.565
on how it's gonna affect him,
and the right way to handle it, and all that.

01:10:13.642 --> 01:10:20.070
Yeah, no, I mean we definitely
read all the books, and articles and...

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:22.149
Blogs, and... You know.

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:24.348
- On all the various... I mean...
- Right.

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.388
- I mean, we definitely...
- We got into it.

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:29.981
- All over the place.
- Yeah, 'cause when you're dealing

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:32.357
with something as important
as bringing a child into the world,

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:35.124
you might want to have
a few key discussions, you know?

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.864
Maybe sign a legal document or something?

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:43.765
No, this way was more of a "Let's just
roll the dice and see what happens," right?

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:46.297
It's just a life.

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:49.834
Yeah, but the proof is in the pudding.
I mean, he's a great kid.

01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:51.411
- He is a great kid.
- Yeah.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.573
- He's a great kid.
- And funny.

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:56.674
The kid's got shtick,
already got shtick, this kid.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.054
Yeah, we think he's pretty great, Ben.

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.616
But do any parents ever say
that their kid's not great?

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.782
I mean, that's like really taboo.

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:06.760
They'd probably revoke
your parenting license or something.

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:10.158
What about you, Maryjane,
do you want to have kids?

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:11.594
Oh, God, no!

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:15.334
I mean, it's amazing for you guys,
and you're all doing such a good job,

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.395
and you're happy, and it makes sense,

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:20.967
but I'm like a gypsy.
I do eight shows a week and I'm never home,

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:24.274
and I have to be able to leave town
on a moment's notice.

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:27.679
And, honestly, I've just never had the urge.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.919
And I really enjoy my freedom, so...

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:32.476
- She does.
- I do.

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.385
- You like your freedom.
- I like it.

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:36.686
You know, some people
just aren't meant to be parents.

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:43.395
Look, none of us really
ever thinks we're doing a perfect job.

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:44.966
- Right.
- God, yeah.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.931
But it's just par for the course.
That's the gig.

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:48.799
But then you have those moments,
you come home from work,

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:51.101
you open the door, your kid runs in
and gives you a big hug,

01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:52.731
and it's kind of game over, right?

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:55.139
And that's kind of the whole thing
right there, you know.

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:58.304
But how are you two gonna deal with this?

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:03.309
I mean, if all this awesomeness continues.

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:08.555
You know what, I feel like there are so many
unconventional parenting situations,

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:11.024
I mean, Cole came home the other day

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:13.323
and asked why his friend Bobby
had two moms.

01:12:13.762 --> 01:12:15.525
- Not everybody is the same.
- Right.

01:12:15.731 --> 01:12:19.861
Well, look, I know for my part,
I'm not gonna introduce Jule to my kids

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:23.928
until I'm certain
we're fully committed to one another.

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:28.234
It'll be too confusing for them
if they see their dad

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:30.207
with a different woman
every couple of months.

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:32.243
- Sure. No, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.551
Jase, you're fucked.
What are you going to do?

01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:38.712
What?

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:40.946
This is the longest relationship he's been in.

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:43.215
And what is it, seven weeks old?
How old is it?

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:44.987
Okay, all right.

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:46.721
You know what, Benny?

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:50.959
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I have never been happier, so...

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.061
People change, you know?

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:56.895
God knows you have. What is that,
your sixth scotch? Is that what's going on?

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:59.566
No, this is not booze...
This is not booze talking.

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:02.235
I'm just trying to set it straight,
put it out there,

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:05.903
because I think our friend Kurt here has
actually raised some very good questions.

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.312
I mean, seriously,

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.950
you guys didn't think any of this through.

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:16.558
You made a totally irresponsible decision
about a kid!

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:20.284
And, yeah, Joe is fine now. He's one!

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:24.665
But do you really think
he's going to be okay later

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:27.031
when he finds out that his parents
never loved each other?

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:28.194
Even when they had him?

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:31.997
That it was just some, like, arrangement,
so they could have sex with hotter people!

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:33.232
Ben!

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:36.672
Do you really think you of all people
should be doling out parenting advice?

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.042
You really think Troy's doing great

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:39.910
being around two people
that fucking hate each other?

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:42.450
- Hey, hey, hey, guys...
- I'm being serious!

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.918
It's a nice night, let's just have New Year's...

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:48.047
You know, why don't we just dial it down
a notch? I mean, it's a ski trip!

01:13:48.123 --> 01:13:50.284
No, no, no, you know what?
You know what? I'm not finished.

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:53.457
You think that I haven't
thought this through?

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:58.262
You think that we don't love each other?

01:14:00.135 --> 01:14:03.662
You know, I've loved this girl
for 19 years, Ben.

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.634
That is fully half of my life.

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:08.271
I know everything
there is to know about her.

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:11.710
I know the mood she's in
when she wakes up in the morning.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.772
Always happy, ready for the day,
can you imagine?

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.780
I know that she's honest,

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:19.443
she won't even take the little
shampoo bottles from the hotel room,

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:21.580
or sneak into the movie theater
for a double feature.

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:23.989
She always buys a second ticket, always.

01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:26.452
I know that we have the same values,

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:30.521
we have the same taste,
we have the same sense of humor.

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:35.396
I know that we both think that
organized religion is completely full of shit.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.905
I know that if she is ever paralyzed
from the neck down,

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:40.965
she would like me to unplug her, and I will.

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:46.074
I know her position on just about
everything, and I am on board!

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.582
I am on board with everything about her.

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.140
So you tell me, Ben!

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.580
What better woman could I have picked
to be the mother of my child?

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:55.679
Seriously!

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:58.291
What more responsible choice
could I have made?

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.622
You tell me!

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:01.185
Fucking prick!

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.092
Seriously, so whatever happens,
whatever the fuck happens,

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:07.499
this year, or next year, or whenever,

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:10.227
we're gonna be fine.

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:12.031
Okay?

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:13.633
Okay.

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:16.639
Whatever.

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:21.008
You always want to find some way
to stay above the fray, right?

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:23.517
Have your cake and eat it, too.
Well, guess what?

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:27.849
If you think that you and Jule
are gonna be BFFs for life,

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:30.287
- and that Titty McTitteneimer...
- Hey!

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:31.621
...greatest fuck in your life...
- Hey!

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:34.093
And "Oh, my God, she snowboards,"

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:38.928
is not gonna make you bored as shit
one day, then you are fucking wrong!

01:15:41.303 --> 01:15:45.740
I mean, Missy and I used to have sex
in the bathroom of the train

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:47.775
because we couldn't wait to get home.

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:50.375
She gave me a fucking blowjob
on the Taconic!

01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:51.434
Now look at us!

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:58.578
But good luck to you guys.
I can't wait to see how it all turns out.

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.554
Sweetie, are you...

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:09.363
Hey, it's okay.

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:49.099
Hey, babe, what's up? You okay?

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:52.004
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You sure?

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:54.700
You look a little...

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:59.136
Sorry, no. It's just stuff.

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:42.618
Okay, so, Maryjane,
this is my father and my mother.

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:43.748
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm Marcy.

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:45.486
- Marcy, it's so nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.323
- That's my dad.
- Hi, Phil. How are you?

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:49.421
- You were stunning. Absolutely stunning.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.328
Hey, good morning.

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.061
They look beautiful.

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:37.204
Mom, I'm gonna go.

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:42.072
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:44.812
Are you certain this is okay?
Are you okay with him?

01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:47.420
Are you kidding? I live for this.

01:18:47.589 --> 01:18:49.489
I just wish you'd ask me more often.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:53.622
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:57.759
See, that's my baby.

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.632
Your momma is my baby.

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:04.502
Okay, gorgeous boy,
let's go get you dressed.

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:06.800
All right, sweetheart. I love you.

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:09.337
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:10.800
Love you.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.811
Thanks, Mom.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:20.479
Hey.

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:22.752
- Hi.
- Happy birthday.

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:24.824
- Thanks.
- Wow, you look great.

01:19:24.893 --> 01:19:25.882
Thanks.

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:28.357
Where is everybody?
I thought I'd be the last.

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:30.225
You are.

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.261
- What?
- It's just us.

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:34.097
- Your table is ready.
- Thank you.

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:37.370
Don't tell me everybody's sitter crapped out.

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:40.966
- Yeah, something like that.
- I'm sorry, doll, that sucks.

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.270
- Thank you. It's all right.
- Thanks.

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:45.975
Well, where's Kurt?

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:49.314
Kurt is not coming.

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:52.714
Oh, shit. You guys have a fight?

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:54.413
No.

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:01.690
I don't understand, so what's wrong?

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:05.466
Nothing. Nothing. Kurt is...

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:07.892
Perfect.

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:10.369
Yes. It's annoying.

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:18.312
- He wants me to meet his kids this weekend.
- Oh, yeah?

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:22.444
Wow, that's big. You ready for it?

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:28.478
No.

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:33.719
Doll, what is it?
You seem weird, or sad, or something.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.468
Kurt is

01:20:40.535 --> 01:20:42.969
the nicest,

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:44.699
smartest,

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:46.968
hottest,

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:49.909
most caring man I have ever dated.

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:52.035
Yep.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.406
Seems to have it all.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.847
Several notches above Andy
on his best day.

01:20:58.186 --> 01:21:02.418
And for some strange reason,
he seems genuinely into me.

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:05.889
He adores you, it's obvious.

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:11.197
But all I do when I'm with him
is think about you.

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:22.603
I didn't invite Kurt or anyone here tonight

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:27.276
because I just wanted to be with family.

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:31.475
You're my family.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.283
You and Joe. Just you and Joe.

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:37.983
Not my mom, not even Leslie.
Just you guys.

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:42.395
I'm so in love with you
I don't know what to do.

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:43.795
Oh, honey...

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:49.261
Hey, hey, hey.

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:52.229
It's okay. It's okay.

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:01.115
Hey, hey, hey, Jule, Jule...

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:06.954
I don't know
when you started the cocktails...

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:08.653
I'm not drunk.

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.284
I'm not drunk.

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:14.127
Well, I'm with Maryjane.

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:17.631
I know, but you and I both know
that's gonna burn out soon.

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.030
Jule...

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.896
She's moving in with me.

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:39.615
But all those things that you said
at the cabin, you said...

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:41.478
Yeah, I meant all of them.

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:46.451
Jule, I love you so much.

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:50.086
As a friend.

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:53.963
You're my best friend.

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:57.402
You're my best friend.

01:22:59.207 --> 01:23:02.472
I'm just not attracted to you...

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.104
Like that.

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:09.742
I mean, God knows you're attractive,
you are beautiful.

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:11.044
I'm just...

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:16.085
See, I thought you felt the same way.

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:18.483
Jule...

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:36.036
"Feel the ground, ants running round.

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:39.774
"Feel the ground,
you scratched little feet. "

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:51.653
You know, leaving a rent-stabilized
apartment in Manattan

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:54.388
is considered a cry for help in many circles.

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:01.530
Brooklyn, huh?

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:04.037
Never thought that day would come.

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:08.265
That's two cards. Just so you know.

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:10.810
PS 687 is the best public pre-school.

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:13.908
And you know I can't afford
half of 20K a year for private.

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:15.310
I don't work in advertising.

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:17.781
You know I'd pay for school.
I've always said that.

01:24:17.852 --> 01:24:19.183
No, that's not the arrangement.

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:21.916
Everything down the middle, right? Even.

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.683
So you get to take him away from me?

01:24:26.661 --> 01:24:31.496
- Three trains or a $70 cab ride? That's even?
- Please don't do this.

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:32.688
Well...

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:35.962
You can see him whenever you want,
as much as you want.

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:40.167
I just can't be close to you anymore.

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:49.606
- Where do you want this, hon?
- Right there is fine. Thanks.

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:56.482
Babe, you want a latte?

01:24:57.292 --> 01:25:00.784
No, no, I'm on a cleanse.

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:05.058
I have to drop five by Friday.

01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:11.400
A one, a two...

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:17.639
Wait, wait. Hold my hand.

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:26.111
That's what you need.
You need a guy like Jim.

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:27.415
That is true.

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:30.424
Wait a minute, I just got him.
Don't take him away.

01:25:30.492 --> 01:25:31.982
You make the rest of us look bad.

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:33.692
Is it burning?

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:35.626
It's not burning? Okay.

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:37.631
- And what about...
- I don't want ketchup!

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:40.166
Is the ketchup
inside your nostril still burning, Milo?

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:42.101
- It's wet.
- Who made it wet?

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:44.138
- Whose big idea was that?
- Stop it. You guys.

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:46.173
You guys, I mean it. No, no, no.
We're doing so well.

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:48.801
Why would you wanna bring your kids
to a place like this?

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:50.606
People are fucking crazy.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.669
- Yeah.
- Good job.

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:55.646
Please, please, please don't.
Okay, thank you very much.

01:25:55.717 --> 01:25:57.810
- Hi.
- Your kids are adorable.

01:25:57.886 --> 01:26:00.946
Thank you. We thought we'd try.
See how far we get.

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:02.011
It's my husband's birthday.

01:26:02.557 --> 01:26:04.286
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:09.393
- How old are they?
- She is seven, and the twins are five.

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:13.534
I have a boy.
He's gonna be two in a few months.

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:15.592
Oh, God. Get ready.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.161
Thanks.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.305
Actually, now I miss twos.

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:25.207
All right, you guys, listen.
Those nice people next to us,

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.444
they don't want French fries flying
into their plates, okay?

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:31.917
So if you eat everything,
and if you eat nicely,

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:34.352
we can have ice cream for dessert.

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:42.361
Hey, he's ready. I'll go get him.

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:46.730
- Hey, did you hear? They're closing Ollie's.
- No, I hadrt.

01:26:47.168 --> 01:26:48.260
End of an era.

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:50.427
- Let me... I'll go grab him.
- Okay.

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:51.904
Sweetie, your dad's here.

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:55.440
Hi! Oh, my goodness, you're gorgeous.

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:58.445
- Hi. So happy to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.674
We were just drinking heavily by ourselves.

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:04.240
- Thank you for saving us.
- Heavily. That's the best.

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:06.914
- That's even worse.
- I don't know whose it is.

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:09.115
It just comes out sometimes.

01:27:11.192 --> 01:27:13.990
- Thanks for coming out, man.
- Yeah, sure.

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:17.362
- It's been a while.
- Yes, it has.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:22.463
I just wanted to apologize in person,
by the way.

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:28.239
For being such a profound asshole
up in Vermont.

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:30.976
I was in a really bad place, man.

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:33.912
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you. Thanks.

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:36.844
Yeah, that wasrt great.

01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:42.622
But you know what? You were right.

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:45.520
About pretty much everything.

01:27:47.495 --> 01:27:49.326
Yeah, Alex told me about MJ.
Sorry about that.

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:51.831
Oh, no, that's fine.

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:58.004
It's everything else that really sucks.

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.370
Yeah, I heard about that, too.

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:05.008
It's amazing how fleeting it is, you know?

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:08.508
That thing, whatever it is.

01:28:10.852 --> 01:28:12.251
Being into someone new.

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:15.982
Yes, I've had a few
one-night versions of that

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:19.083
over the last six months.
Not that I'm particularly proud of, but...

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.490
No, it's crazy. It's like one day,
they're the hottest thing on two legs,

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:27.625
and then the next,
they just look ugly to you.

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:30.963
That's why you stay with someone

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:34.668
you want to be with
under the worst possible circumstances.

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:40.572
That's what Missy and I didn't have.
When things were great, we were great.

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:43.975
As soon as things got hard,

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:45.679
we didn't want to be
anywhere near each other.

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.954
I had a really dirty dream about her.

01:28:55.396 --> 01:28:57.125
MJ? I had like 10. Dude...

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:59.325
No. Dude, Julie.

01:29:03.604 --> 01:29:04.730
Julie.

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:05.898
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:11.475
I don't know. I'm... You know.
It's like... Fucking Jesus.

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:17.747
So why didn't you guys ever even try
being together?

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:21.050
I mean, after Andy was out of the picture,
you were right there.

01:29:21.122 --> 01:29:24.580
I don't know, man.
Just too much familiarity, you know?

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:28.058
Nothing surprising.

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:33.125
It's like she's one of my limbs or something.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:36.432
Like she's part of my body, you know?

01:29:38.573 --> 01:29:41.303
And that's bad because...

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.831
Hey.

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:44.894
Hi, buddy. Hi, buddy.

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.234
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:47.774
Did you save any pizza for me?

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:50.242
No pizza for me. No pizza for me.

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.642
All right, listen, it's bedtime.

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:54.704
We should say good night to your dad.
It's way past your bedtime.

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:57.012
Wait. I just...

01:30:57.084 --> 01:31:00.918
I know the big birthday is next week,
and I just...

01:31:00.988 --> 01:31:03.183
You never opened your gift from last year,

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:06.090
so I just wanted to get it to you
under the wire.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:09.357
That's nice. I don't need any gifts.

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:13.161
No, just take it. You know.
Throw it away if you want.

01:31:13.234 --> 01:31:14.326
Open it! Open it!

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.893
- No, I don't really...
- Open it, Mommy!

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:19.306
No, sweetie, I'll just...

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:21.807
Thanks for taking him tonight.
I had a really rough deadline.

01:31:21.876 --> 01:31:23.776
- Sure.
- Daddy, stay!

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:25.568
Daddy, stay!

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:28.706
- Okay, sweetie, we're gonna go to bed.
- Daddy, open present.

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:31.445
- That's okay.
- Stay and open present, Daddy!

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:34.283
You know what? This is what we'll do.
We'll open the present real fast

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:36.289
as long as you promise
to go right to bed, okay?

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:38.416
- You promise to go right to bed.
- I want Daddy to put me to bed!

01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:42.156
- No, that's okay, buddy.
- I want Daddy to put me to bed!

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:45.293
Daddy, stay!

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:48.524
Okay, all right, you know what?
We'll both put you to bed,

01:31:48.603 --> 01:31:50.468
and then we'll open the present,

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:52.369
and then you're going to go to sleep
real quick, okay?

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.930
- Okay.
- Daddy, stay!

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:56.405
Here we go.

01:31:57.078 --> 01:31:58.443
Come on in.

01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:03.144
- Sorry, it's kind of a mess.
- Oh, no, it's great.

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:05.510
Wow, you get square footage
in Brooklyn, huh?

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:07.247
Yeah, we like it.

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:12.358
Okay, you're going to open it really fast?
Are you gonna rip it open?

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:14.519
- Yeah.
- You're gonna rip it open?

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:16.529
- Real fast.
- Okay.

01:32:16.597 --> 01:32:17.996
It's right through here.

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:22.434
Okay, bud, let's get you in your PJs,
and then we'll open the present, okay?

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:25.768
That's our deal, right?
Let's get you your PJs, okay?

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:28.636
- PJs?
- Top left.

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:32.173
Good job. Thank you.

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:35.612
Thank you very much.

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:38.714
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:41.448
Ready for rocket ship? Here you go.

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:43.012
Okay.

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:45.953
These don't fit that well, huh?
I guess you're getting big.

01:32:46.027 --> 01:32:49.861
- Yeah, I guess.
- Here, let's pull your arm right through here.

01:32:50.298 --> 01:32:51.287
There we go.

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:54.027
- I do it.
- You wanna do it?

01:32:54.101 --> 01:32:57.434
We gotta get your shoes off.
Let's put you in the bed. Real quick.

01:32:57.772 --> 01:33:00.605
One foot. Other foot.

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:04.941
All right, there we go.
So now, let's open this present.

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:08.074
- You wanna tear it open?
- Sure.

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:10.208
Okay, let's rip it. Okay.

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:12.986
Oh, my goodness.

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:14.487
- Oh, my goodness.
- Joe power!

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:16.079
How did you do that so fast?

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:18.649
- Oh, my God.
- What is this?

01:33:19.827 --> 01:33:22.057
- What's that?
- A video.

01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:25.587
What is it, huh? You wanna look?

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:32.134
You wanna open it, sweetie?

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:36.701
Oh, God. Well, that's just mean.

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:38.739
- Who's that?
- You wanna know who this is?

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:42.010
That's Mommy, and that's Daddy.
Can you believe that?

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:44.847
Looking really, really dorky.

01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:48.685
- That's Mommy and Daddy.
- That's just terrible. Terrible hair.

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:50.246
But anyway...

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:53.452
That was before your time.
We went on a really fun trip.

01:33:54.328 --> 01:33:55.659
- And that's you.
- Wait. Wait.

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:57.197
Look at this.

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:58.823
That was you.

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.457
- That was you in Mommy's tummy.
- You were in that tummy.

01:34:00.534 --> 01:34:02.024
- Inside the tummy.
- Right there. That was you.

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:04.071
- Can you imagine?
- There, see. See how fat I look.

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:05.127
Mommy looks beautiful.

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:08.536
That was my favorite.

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:11.370
Okay. Okay, that's enough.

01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:14.243
Right? We made a deal, buddy, right?
Let's get you to bed.

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:16.007
Let's get you to bed.

01:34:16.083 --> 01:34:18.483
All right, sweetheart. All right.

01:34:18.753 --> 01:34:20.812
Let's take these pillows off.

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:25.551
I know. I know. Let's get your pillow.
Let's get you cozy.

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:29.521
I want Daddy to sleep at our house.

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:36.861
Why doesn't Daddy sleep
in our house?

01:34:36.937 --> 01:34:40.703
Well, Daddy sleeps in his house,
and you know what?

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:42.902
- What?
- You get two houses to sleep in

01:34:42.977 --> 01:34:44.911
because you're the most special ever,

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:48.608
and only really special people get
two houses to sleep in.

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:50.816
I wish I could sleep at your house, bud.

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:53.443
What are you doing?

01:34:55.256 --> 01:34:56.689
I want to stay in your house.

01:34:58.592 --> 01:35:01.322
Okay, sweetie. I love you so much.
Good night, okay.

01:35:04.965 --> 01:35:07.092
Okay, buddy, good night.

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:09.227
- I love you. Okay.
- Love you, too.

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:13.896
- Hey.
- What the hell was that about?

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:15.441
- You want to tell me what that was about?
- Sorry.

01:35:15.509 --> 01:35:17.841
- I'm sorry.
- You can't say shit like that to a kid.

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:19.743
- You understand that?
- I know. I'm sorry.

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:21.145
I just...

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:25.050
You know, I didn't want him to...

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:29.084
I want...

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:32.915
Please don't do that.

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:34.886
- Please don't do that.
- I'm sorry.

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:40.995
Look, I don't know
where all this is coming from.

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:45.632
I'm sorry if you're feeling lonely, or guilty,
or whatever it is you're feeling,

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:48.539
but, look, you can't come into my house

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:51.601
and say all this confusing shit
to a two-and-a-half-year-old. You just can't.

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:55.873
- I know.
- Jase, I'm finally in a good place, okay?

01:35:56.484 --> 01:36:00.921
I'm not angry at you. I'm not pining for you.
I'm dating a lot. I'm good.

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:04.781
So just... You should go home.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.691
Okay, I...

01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:10.729
You can get out this way. Please.

01:36:43.597 --> 01:36:45.189
Fuck.

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:38.476
- What do you want?
- Slow painful death by disease.

01:38:40.281 --> 01:38:43.614
- What?
- I'd like to revise my earlier answer.

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:49.179
- Okay, it's freezing, and I have no idea...
- I said that I would rather live

01:38:49.256 --> 01:38:53.124
and watch the love of my life
die a slow painful death by disease

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:55.889
than myself die
a slow painful death by disease.

01:38:58.666 --> 01:39:00.133
I don't feel that way anymore.

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:04.169
Because the thing is when I said that, I...

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:09.502
I'd never had a love of my life, okay?
I mean, I didn't know I did.

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:12.577
I was just too fucking stupid to realize it.

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:15.240
And it's not because I'm lonely,
or desperate, or whatever else you think.

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:18.479
It's because I realized
that we got it all wrong.

01:39:19.553 --> 01:39:20.986
- Excuse me?
- Both of us.

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:24.115
I'm sorry. You're gonna really
come back here and tell me...

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:27.627
We had this great plan
that we would raise a kid together,

01:39:27.695 --> 01:39:30.858
so we could still have
the romantic part, right?

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:34.592
But you see,

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:39.196
this was the romantic part.

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:45.841
Everything we had was the romantic part.

01:39:48.782 --> 01:39:51.114
Everything else was just filler.

01:39:54.621 --> 01:39:55.713
Shit!

01:39:58.859 --> 01:39:59.848
Shit!

01:40:01.362 --> 01:40:03.159
What am I supposed to do with that?

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:07.929
I mean, really, what am I supposed
to do with that?

01:40:09.103 --> 01:40:12.004
Just come in here
and say all that great stuff.

01:40:12.072 --> 01:40:14.040
And I'm just supposed
to believe you all of a sudden?

01:40:14.108 --> 01:40:15.575
I mean, after everything
that we've been through?

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:17.371
- I know what I've said.
- After everything you said...

01:40:17.444 --> 01:40:21.175
I know what I said that night,
and all I can say is I...

01:40:25.419 --> 01:40:28.217
It was just too much, okay?

01:40:30.758 --> 01:40:32.282
I wasrt ready.

01:40:34.762 --> 01:40:37.287
Look, I know my timing sucks, but...

01:40:41.135 --> 01:40:45.731
You're the love of my life, Jule.
You're my person, and...

01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:50.235
That's just the way it is.

01:40:53.981 --> 01:40:55.744
I miss you so much.

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:04.250
Don't you miss me at all?

01:41:07.761 --> 01:41:09.023
Even a little?

01:41:11.131 --> 01:41:13.827
- I miss you a little.
- Yeah?

01:41:17.137 --> 01:41:22.666
But see, I'm not just gonna be with someone
who's not into me.

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:34.780
- Does that feel like not into you?
- No.

01:41:35.522 --> 01:41:38.184
'Cause right now
I just really want to have sex with you.

01:41:39.793 --> 01:41:40.885
I wanna fuck the shit out of you.

01:41:42.696 --> 01:41:47.395
Please, please, just let me
fuck the shit out of you right now.

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:51.163
And if you're not convinced afterwards
that I am into you

01:41:51.238 --> 01:41:54.401
in every possible way
a person can be into another person,

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:59.105
then I promise I will never try to kiss you,
or fuck you,

01:41:59.179 --> 01:42:03.081
or impregnate you ever again,
as long as I live. I swear to God.

01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:05.577
Okay?

01:42:06.887 --> 01:42:08.081
Please.

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:10.550
Please.

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:13.657
What do you say?

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:18.094
I say...

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:22.026
Fuck the shit out of me.

01:42:23.337 --> 01:42:24.463
Yeah?
