WEBVTT

00:03.094 --> 00:05.854
KC, it's time for
your yearly review.

00:05.889 --> 00:08.323
Oh, is that why we're here,

00:08.359 --> 00:11.026
because I had totally
forgotten about that.

00:11.061 --> 00:12.630
By the way, here's a $400
orchid arrangement.

00:12.654 --> 00:14.704
Completely a coinky-dink.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.340
You were saying something
about a review?

00:18.452 --> 00:21.053
Well, your surveillance ability
is top notch.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.688
That's my girl.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.348
Your recon skills
are off the charts.

00:24.383 --> 00:26.032
That's my girl.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.776
But you've also broken
a lot of rules.

00:27.811 --> 00:29.978
BOTH: That's your girl.

00:30.013 --> 00:33.465
So some of my spying
wasn't by the book.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.108
But I put
a lot of bad guys away.

00:35.143 --> 00:37.143
Which is why you're
in line for a promotion

00:37.179 --> 00:38.832
to be the youngest
senior junior special agent

00:38.856 --> 00:40.713
we've ever had.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.634
Nice. Youngest
senior special, um...

00:43.669 --> 00:46.286
What does that mean?

00:46.321 --> 00:49.381
More advanced missions and
higher level security clearance.

00:49.458 --> 00:53.110
But first, you have to pass
a very difficult test.

00:53.145 --> 00:54.480
Perfect. I love tests.
Is it multiple choice?

00:54.504 --> 00:56.463
- Can't say.
- Essay?

00:56.498 --> 00:58.126
- Can't say.
- Is it a test of physical stamina?

00:58.150 --> 00:59.899
- Can't say.
- Can you tell me what it is?

00:59.935 --> 01:01.502
- No.
- Tell me what it is. - No.

01:01.537 --> 01:03.403
- What is it? - Soon.
- Ha!

01:03.438 --> 01:05.022
Got that out of you.

01:05.057 --> 01:07.791
- Is that part of the test? Did I pass?
- No.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.284
No, it wasn't
part of the test or...

01:09.319 --> 01:12.003
- Get out.
- Okay.

01:12.038 --> 01:15.382
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:15.417 --> 01:18.577
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:18.654 --> 01:21.538
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

01:21.573 --> 01:26.509
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

01:26.545 --> 01:30.213
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

01:30.248 --> 01:32.307
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

01:32.343 --> 01:36.378
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

01:36.413 --> 01:40.315
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

01:40.351 --> 01:42.384
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

01:42.419 --> 01:44.661
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

01:44.696 --> 01:46.846
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

01:46.882 --> 01:49.040
¶ But I always got your back ¶

01:49.075 --> 01:51.134
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

01:51.169 --> 01:53.128
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

01:53.163 --> 01:56.056
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

01:56.091 --> 01:57.126
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

01:57.150 --> 01:59.476
I keep it undercover.

01:59.511 --> 02:00.511
I keep it undercover.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.811
You're in Lithuania, and you
need to get to a safe house.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.185
Which is the closest one
to the capital?

02:09.220 --> 02:11.129
The capital of Lithuania
is Palanga,

02:11.164 --> 02:13.273
so I would say Kelme,

02:13.308 --> 02:15.091
in a sausage factory
in the cellar,

02:15.126 --> 02:16.910
third door to the left.

02:16.945 --> 02:18.225
Whoo! Do I know
my stuff or what?

02:20.090 --> 02:22.991
- What.
- Excuse me.

02:23.026 --> 02:25.526
The capital of Lithuania
is Vilnius,

02:25.562 --> 02:27.996
the closest safe house
is in Trakai,

02:28.031 --> 02:29.581
and apart from there
being a door,

02:29.616 --> 02:31.850
everything else you said
was completely wrong.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.018
Great. So my test could be
at any minute,

02:34.054 --> 02:36.029
and I'm completely unprepared.

02:36.064 --> 02:38.139
This is gonna be an epic fail.

02:38.175 --> 02:41.501
Relax. I promise you,
you're gonna do great.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.289
You're just saying that 'cause you
don't wanna help me study anymore.

02:43.313 --> 02:46.198
Hey, look at that.
You finally got one right.

02:48.193 --> 02:50.627
KC, guess what.

02:50.662 --> 02:52.879
I'm hosting
a foreign exchange student

02:52.914 --> 02:56.458
for two whole weeks,
a guy from Sweden.

02:56.493 --> 03:00.153
Population 9.5 million,
chief export, tiny candy fish.

03:00.188 --> 03:01.922
Actually,
it's refined petroleum.

03:04.810 --> 03:08.728
Anyway, I am getting a Swede.

03:08.763 --> 03:11.023
Have you ever seen a Swede?

03:11.099 --> 03:13.984
They are all gorgeous,
blonde, and look like Thor.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.952
Thor is going to be
living at my house

03:15.988 --> 03:18.121
for two whole weeks. Thor!

03:18.156 --> 03:21.900
And your father is okay with
Thor moving in with you guys?

03:21.935 --> 03:25.153
Oh, my father.

03:25.188 --> 03:27.868
I should probably tell him we're
hosting a foreign exchange student.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.201
( Chainsaw revving )

03:34.423 --> 03:36.223
Wow, Marisa's dad did not
take that news well.

03:38.793 --> 03:40.043
( Chainsaw continues )

03:45.500 --> 03:48.635
Craig, will you get down from
there before you hurt yourself?

03:48.670 --> 03:50.323
Hurry up and hurt yourself,
'cause I'm trying to study

03:50.347 --> 03:52.747
and all that ( imitates
chainsaw) is not helping.

03:52.782 --> 03:55.108
Your father is too cheap
to hire a tree trimmer.

03:55.143 --> 03:57.586
I know what I'm doing.

03:57.621 --> 03:59.779
Dad, you barely know how
to trim your nose hairs.

03:59.814 --> 04:01.422
How are you gonna trim a tree?

04:01.458 --> 04:03.900
How hard can it be?

04:03.935 --> 04:06.077
It's just one branch.
( chainsaw revs )

04:06.112 --> 04:08.212
- Got it.
- ( branch snaps )

04:08.248 --> 04:09.781
- ( glass shatters )
- Uh-oh.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.912
- Hey, you know that branch I was just trying to cut down?
- Yeah.

04:15.947 --> 04:19.816
- It may or may not have ended up in Mrs. Goldfeder's kitchen.
- Oh, boy.

04:19.851 --> 04:21.568
Maybe Mrs. Goldfeder
won't notice.

04:21.603 --> 04:24.538
( Mrs. Goldfeder shrieking )

04:24.573 --> 04:25.714
Yeah, I think she noticed.

04:29.694 --> 04:34.422
So, Cooper, what do you plan
on doing about your tree

04:34.458 --> 04:37.742
that's currently residing
on top of my refrigerator?

04:37.778 --> 04:40.203
Hey, look on the bright side.

04:40.239 --> 04:43.974
It could be residing
on the top of your Petey.

04:44.009 --> 04:46.226
What she means to say is,

04:46.261 --> 04:48.611
as much as we love your kitchen,

04:48.646 --> 04:50.663
we think a skylight
would be a nice way

04:50.698 --> 04:52.716
to brighten things up.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.442
We mean we're sorry.

04:54.477 --> 04:56.670
Don't apologize.

04:56.747 --> 04:58.588
Just pay for a suite at
the Five Seasons Hotel.

04:58.623 --> 05:01.958
The last time I checked,
there was only four seasons.

05:01.993 --> 05:03.601
Hm, let's see.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.170
Winter, spring, summer, fall,

05:06.206 --> 05:09.315
and oh yeah, lawsuit!

05:09.351 --> 05:11.701
I am not paying for a suite
at that fancy hotel.

05:11.737 --> 05:13.637
What he means is,

05:13.672 --> 05:17.115
why don't you just stay here
until your house is repaired?

05:17.150 --> 05:20.110
No, no, no, no, no!

05:20.145 --> 05:22.829
Stop the clock.
They cannot stay here...

05:22.865 --> 05:25.156
because I have
that big exam at school

05:25.191 --> 05:27.109
to study for, remember?

05:27.144 --> 05:29.185
We'd love to.

05:29.220 --> 05:31.646
I'll go pack my sundries.

05:31.682 --> 05:33.665
You will be hiring
a cleaning crew, right?

05:33.700 --> 05:35.617
We can't have this mess

05:35.652 --> 05:37.004
when you host
the neighborhood pot luck.

05:37.028 --> 05:39.729
The neighborhood what the heck
are you talking about?

05:39.764 --> 05:41.264
We didn't hear about
any pot luck.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.607
Is this a new thing?

05:42.642 --> 05:44.884
No, we have it every year...

05:44.919 --> 05:46.336
Yeah, yeah, it's new.

05:49.257 --> 05:50.823
I was supposed to host it
at my house,

05:50.859 --> 05:53.025
but now it's here,

05:53.061 --> 05:55.152
because you casa is mi casa.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.155
You know what's a better casa?

05:57.191 --> 06:00.199
The International
Casa of Pancakes.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.134
They got a little private
room in the back, too.

06:01.169 --> 06:04.395
My lawyer's on speed dial.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.881
Whoa, whoa. KC's just joking.

06:06.916 --> 06:09.275
We'd be happy to host
the pot luck.

06:12.338 --> 06:14.022
What are you guys thinking?

06:14.057 --> 06:16.182
If I don't pass that test,

06:16.217 --> 06:18.843
I have to wait a whole
nother year to take it.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.598
Then I'll be the oldest youngest
junior senior specialist agent ever.

06:22.466 --> 06:23.926
I for one think hosting
a neighborhood pot luck

06:23.950 --> 06:26.042
is a great idea.

06:26.077 --> 06:28.953
We're spies, but we're
also human beings,

06:28.989 --> 06:30.839
and we're disconnected
from our neighbors.

06:30.874 --> 06:34.050
We need to be part of
the fabric of this society.

06:34.085 --> 06:36.336
Or at least not be
the uninvited losers.

06:36.371 --> 06:38.237
Guys, we cannot do
this pot luck.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.831
I need to study for my test.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.733
KC, sorry. It's a done deal.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.452
Okay, fine.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.388
Now Mrs. Goldfeder
and the entire neighborhood

06:46.423 --> 06:48.773
will be hanging out
in our house.

06:48.808 --> 06:51.734
Hey, maybe we can all
celebrate my failure together.

06:51.769 --> 06:54.929
Hey, KC, you know what you
can bring to the pot luck?

06:54.965 --> 06:57.323
A better attitude.

07:03.331 --> 07:05.815
KC, meet my foreign
exchange student,

07:05.850 --> 07:08.451
who ironically
you cannot exchange,

07:08.486 --> 07:10.962
because, trust me, I have tried.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.490
Hi. I'm KC. Nice to meet you.

07:13.525 --> 07:15.365
( Swedish accent )
It is nice to meet you, too.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.455
There has been a huge mix-up.

07:20.490 --> 07:23.008
I was expecting tall,
muscle-y Thor,

07:23.043 --> 07:25.260
and I got stuck
with this... Jerk.

07:25.295 --> 07:27.244
Okay, Marisa, do not
call him that.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.038
Why not? That is his name.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.765
Hey, Jerk, come over here.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.459
Actually, it's "Yerk."

07:33.495 --> 07:36.571
Like New Yerk.
Yerk, ja, this is me.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.052
Can you believe I got
stuck with this Yerk?

07:43.088 --> 07:46.664
He looks nothing like
the guy in the brochures.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.492
This is not the Swede I ordered.

07:49.528 --> 07:51.686
Marisa, he is
a foreign exchange student.

07:51.722 --> 07:52.999
He is not
your mail order boyfriend.

07:53.023 --> 07:54.255
Can't he be both?

07:56.660 --> 07:59.177
Come on, Yerk.
Let's go. ( Yodels )

08:02.624 --> 08:04.304
Marisa, I'm pretty sure
that's Switzerland.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.178
Petey, you're going
to sleep up here,

08:09.214 --> 08:11.648
and if you need anything,
that's too bad.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.285
Sleep up here?

08:15.320 --> 08:17.270
With a view of all the trees?

08:17.305 --> 08:18.721
I don't think I can do it.

08:18.756 --> 08:21.708
Petey, you can't do
a lot of things.

08:21.743 --> 08:23.425
But if you take
sleeping off the table,

08:23.461 --> 08:25.770
you're left with very little.

08:25.805 --> 08:29.190
A tree came crashing
through my roof.

08:29.225 --> 08:32.118
My whole life
flashed before my eyes.

08:32.153 --> 08:33.920
Granted, it didn't
take very long,

08:33.955 --> 08:35.655
but it flashed.

08:35.690 --> 08:36.810
I'll be too scared to sleep.

08:36.841 --> 08:39.509
I've never been scared.
Just wasn't wired that way.

08:41.345 --> 08:44.272
Never been scared, huh?

08:44.307 --> 08:45.807
We'll see about that.

08:48.979 --> 08:51.921
( Shrieks )

08:51.956 --> 08:54.549
Boy, if you're trying
to scare me,

08:54.584 --> 08:57.869
you're gonna have to try
a lot harder than that.

08:57.904 --> 09:00.714
Ninety-eight burpees.

09:00.749 --> 09:04.275
Ninety-nine burpees.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.885
Named after its inventor,

09:05.921 --> 09:08.171
physiologist Royal H. Burpee.

09:08.206 --> 09:10.464
That's not gonna be on my test,

09:10.500 --> 09:11.224
but it's good to know;
I might be on<i> Jeopardy</i> one da.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.301
Who's Burpee, Alex?

09:13.337 --> 09:15.928
One hundred.

09:15.964 --> 09:18.990
Hi, roomie.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.767
Thanks for letting me
bunk with you.

09:20.802 --> 09:22.310
You sure I'm not
putting you out?

09:22.345 --> 09:24.078
Oh, no, it's all good.

09:24.113 --> 09:25.513
I set up an air mattress
over there.

09:25.540 --> 09:27.640
Good. I'm sure
you'll be comfortable.

09:29.578 --> 09:32.770
Ooh. Memory foam.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.525
And hopefully, it can forget.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.290
You're not going to
do that all night, are you?

09:44.325 --> 09:45.700
Not anymore, I'm not.

10:03.411 --> 10:05.595
( Screaming ) Petey!!

10:05.630 --> 10:08.965
PETEY: What?!

10:09.000 --> 10:10.884
Did you brush your teeth?

10:10.919 --> 10:14.937
- No!
- Go do it now.

10:14.972 --> 10:17.590
You know gingivitis
runs in our family.

10:17.626 --> 10:19.859
But Mom...

10:19.894 --> 10:21.844
For crying out loud,
go brush your teeth!

10:21.879 --> 10:24.739
You don't have to yell, KC.

10:27.444 --> 10:28.718
Good night, Mrs. G.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.827
Nighty-night, dear.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.249
( Crying )

10:46.120 --> 10:48.245
Mrs. G., are you crying...

10:48.281 --> 10:50.056
or calling a bear?

10:50.092 --> 10:53.701
I always cry myself to sleep.

10:53.737 --> 10:57.104
I keep everything
all bottled up during the day,

10:57.139 --> 10:59.365
and then, at night,
I turn out the lights

10:59.400 --> 11:00.733
and let the demons out.

11:02.695 --> 11:05.104
You should try it some time.

11:05.139 --> 11:08.391
Why not?

11:08.426 --> 11:10.266
It'll be good practice
for when I fail my test.

11:12.447 --> 11:16.749
( Both sobbing )

11:22.407 --> 11:25.417
Okay, the whole neighborhood
will be here in a minute,

11:25.452 --> 11:26.784
so put this platter
on the buffet.

11:26.819 --> 11:29.270
( Gasps )
A plastic serving spoon?

11:29.305 --> 11:31.864
What are we, barbarians?

11:31.900 --> 11:33.799
Why don't we just
throw the food on the ground

11:33.835 --> 11:37.236
and let the neighbors
lick it up like dogs?

11:37.272 --> 11:39.912
And he wonders why we've never been
invited to the pot luck before.

11:41.959 --> 11:44.819
All right, guys,
so there's 137 different ways

11:44.854 --> 11:47.763
to dislocate someone's shoulder.
I can only remember 124 of them.

11:47.798 --> 11:50.241
- Oh, wait...
- ( bones cracking )

11:52.137 --> 11:54.988
Yeah, that's 125.

11:55.023 --> 11:57.240
How many ways to pop it back in?

11:57.275 --> 12:00.985
- Just one.
- ( bones cracking )

12:01.021 --> 12:04.122
( watch chiming )

12:04.157 --> 12:06.782
Coopers, we just got intel

12:06.817 --> 12:09.468
that an assassin
hacked our database.

12:09.504 --> 12:10.886
The good news is, we stopped him

12:10.922 --> 12:13.314
before he found any information

12:13.350 --> 12:15.983
- on taking down the Organization.
- And the bad news?

12:16.019 --> 12:18.619
He found a ton of information
about taking down our agents,

12:18.655 --> 12:19.829
like where some of them live.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.581
Well, not us, right?

12:21.616 --> 12:24.867
O... kay.

12:24.902 --> 12:26.961
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.871
This cannot be happening.
I have a test, okay?

12:28.906 --> 12:31.107
I don't have time
to be assassinated.

12:31.142 --> 12:33.685
Guys, we gotta cancel the party.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.204
Is it a going-away party?
Because it probably should be.

12:47.825 --> 12:50.168
Oh, look. I got a gift.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.728
I wonder what it could be.

12:52.764 --> 12:55.348
( Roaring )

12:55.383 --> 12:59.110
I said roar!!

12:59.145 --> 13:02.688
Yeah, I heard what you said.

13:02.723 --> 13:06.708
Come on. Don't tell me
that didn't scare you.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.844
I'm sorry. Here's an idea.

13:08.879 --> 13:10.538
How about you get
back in the box,

13:10.573 --> 13:13.132
and let's try it again.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.918
And this time, give me a
big, loud, angry roar, okay?

13:15.954 --> 13:16.954
Okay, okay.

13:23.086 --> 13:25.253
( Roaring )

13:27.832 --> 13:30.216
Oh, she left.

13:30.252 --> 13:32.677
- ( Roaring )
- ( screaming )

13:35.623 --> 13:37.265
Now that's how you do it.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.703
Welcome, welcome.
How you doin'? All right.

13:42.738 --> 13:46.007
Excuse me.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.534
All right. These crab cakes
are going like hot cakes.

13:48.569 --> 13:50.870
I hope we have enough.

13:50.905 --> 13:52.282
Nothing worse than
running out of food.

13:52.306 --> 13:54.281
Really? Nothing?

13:54.317 --> 13:56.508
How about war? Disease?

13:56.544 --> 13:58.127
Getting knocked off
in your own home

13:58.162 --> 14:00.896
by an unknown assailant?

14:00.931 --> 14:03.232
No one's eating
my stuffed mushrooms.

14:03.268 --> 14:06.327
There's nothing worse than no one
eating your food at a party.

14:06.362 --> 14:09.297
What is wrong with this family?

14:09.332 --> 14:10.667
There is a killer here, and we
need to find out who they are.

14:10.691 --> 14:13.634
KC, we also have
to keep our covers,

14:13.669 --> 14:15.749
which means, like it or not,
this party has to go on.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.657
What are those?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.634
These are
my conversation starters.

14:21.669 --> 14:24.103
I did recon on
all the neighbors,

14:24.138 --> 14:26.013
and wrote up insightful
questions to ask.

14:26.049 --> 14:28.089
That way, they'll be impressed
by my witty repartee.

14:30.153 --> 14:31.463
Then maybe someone
in this neighborhood

14:31.487 --> 14:34.055
will actually like us.

14:34.090 --> 14:37.016
Perfect. I'm gonna go ask the
neighbors these questions,

14:37.051 --> 14:39.434
and see if I can
sniff out our bad guy.

14:39.470 --> 14:40.536
Or gal.

14:43.524 --> 14:45.900
- Hi, Mrs...
- Perkins.

14:45.935 --> 14:47.651
Perkins. How are you doing?

14:47.686 --> 14:50.638
Well, every day's a battle.

14:50.673 --> 14:54.267
Interesting choice of words.

14:54.302 --> 14:57.002
Oh, Perkins. So are you
and Mr. Perkins

14:57.038 --> 14:59.572
still planning on taking
your annual cruise to Majorca?

14:59.607 --> 15:02.283
Well, I'm not going,

15:02.318 --> 15:04.793
but Mr. Perkins is.

15:04.828 --> 15:07.813
He left me three months ago.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.169
And, um, would you say
that made you angry enough

15:13.204 --> 15:15.237
to become a hit man?

15:17.684 --> 15:21.068
You know, this weird
social behavior of yours

15:21.104 --> 15:24.080
is the reason you are never
invited to the pot luck.

15:26.309 --> 15:28.467
Nice talking to you.

15:28.502 --> 15:30.862
Well, now thanks to you,

15:30.897 --> 15:33.155
there's one neighbor
we're never gonna win over.

15:33.191 --> 15:35.082
I'm sorry, Ernie,

15:35.118 --> 15:36.817
but would you like
to be alive or popular?

15:36.853 --> 15:39.036
Gee, let me think about it.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.072
Popular.

15:42.266 --> 15:46.827
I was just sitting there,
minding my own business,

15:46.863 --> 15:48.855
then a tree crashed
into my kitchen.

15:48.890 --> 15:50.648
( All gasping )

15:53.694 --> 15:54.847
Uh, hi. I don't believe
we've ever met.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.737
I'm KC Cooper, and you are?

15:56.772 --> 15:59.181
Martin Sherman. Just moved
in a couple of weeks ago.

15:59.216 --> 16:00.769
Oh, great. How do you
like the neighborhood?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.285
It's fine.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.423
I don't really plan
on being here that long.

16:04.447 --> 16:07.398
Oh. Interesting.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.051
So what do you do
for a living, Mr. Sherman?

16:10.086 --> 16:12.295
That's not something
I discuss at parties.

16:12.330 --> 16:13.546
Huh.

16:16.901 --> 16:18.020
What are you doing?
What's going on?

16:18.044 --> 16:19.618
I know why you're here.

16:19.654 --> 16:21.145
To have a good time?

16:21.181 --> 16:22.788
Oh, save it.

16:22.823 --> 16:24.799
What are you doing
to Mr. Sherman?

16:24.834 --> 16:27.151
He is the assassin, okay?

16:27.228 --> 16:29.237
He's not staying here long,
he just moved here,

16:29.239 --> 16:31.964
and he's not telling me
what he does for a living.

16:31.999 --> 16:36.536
Martin Sherman,
undertaker-embalmer.

16:36.612 --> 16:39.321
Oh, I see how that's
not really good party talk.

16:41.726 --> 16:43.420
Why'd you say
you weren't staying here long?

16:43.444 --> 16:45.377
None of us are.

16:45.412 --> 16:47.705
It's all just temporary.

16:51.861 --> 16:54.612
Great. The one person
in this neighborhood

16:54.647 --> 16:55.975
who didn't have
an opinion about us

16:55.999 --> 16:59.083
now has one, and it's not good.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.121
Okay, I'm sorry. Why am I
the only one in this family

17:01.145 --> 17:02.705
who is worried about
finding the killer?

17:06.267 --> 17:09.285
Mushrooms.
These mushrooms, guys,

17:09.320 --> 17:12.604
are killer!

17:12.640 --> 17:15.066
Yum. They are just... delicious.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.382
Hey, Judy.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.600
Sorry I tried to scare you.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.309
It's cool.

17:34.345 --> 17:37.137
So you accept my apology?

17:37.172 --> 17:41.116
Yeah. It's no big deal.

17:41.152 --> 17:42.626
Then shake on it.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.903
No, we're good.

17:44.939 --> 17:48.223
I insist we make it official.

17:48.259 --> 17:50.484
No, really, Petey,
it's all good.

17:50.520 --> 17:51.894
Shake my hand!

17:55.591 --> 17:57.108
Fine.

18:13.117 --> 18:15.851
Really? Nothing?

18:15.887 --> 18:17.545
You might wanna see
a doctor about that.

18:21.084 --> 18:23.434
Hey, who wants
the last crab cake?

18:23.511 --> 18:24.451
By the way, stay away from
the stuffed mushrooms.

18:24.486 --> 18:25.606
I found a fingernail in 'em.

18:27.657 --> 18:29.948
Thank you.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.383
I can't believe you did that.

18:31.418 --> 18:32.860
What?

18:32.895 --> 18:35.363
Um, in Sweden, Marisa,

18:35.439 --> 18:36.566
it's actually rude
to take the last hors d'oeuvre.

18:36.590 --> 18:38.824
Also rude here.

18:38.859 --> 18:41.085
Kinda rude everywhere.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.319
( Muffled ) Sorry.

18:47.743 --> 18:50.694
Yes, that's much less rude.

18:50.730 --> 18:54.940
Marisa, I have had it
down to here with you.

18:54.975 --> 18:57.309
You have had it
down to here with me?

18:57.345 --> 19:01.204
Yes. You are what's known
as an ugly American,

19:01.240 --> 19:04.683
except that clearly,
you are very attractive.

19:04.718 --> 19:07.136
Hotter than a pocket.

19:07.171 --> 19:12.792
But still, you are
an<i> ugly</i> American.

19:12.827 --> 19:17.238
Well, I want<i> you</i>
on the next bus to Sweden.

19:17.273 --> 19:19.940
I kind of think
you're missing the point

19:19.976 --> 19:21.867
of the exchange program,

19:21.902 --> 19:25.313
and transportation in general.

19:25.348 --> 19:27.389
KC, we have
a crab cake emergency.

19:27.425 --> 19:29.366
We're totally out.

19:29.401 --> 19:30.512
And there's two hours
left of the party.

19:30.536 --> 19:33.787
The real question is
how much time do we have left?

19:33.822 --> 19:35.825
If you need crab cakes,
you should just order in some

19:35.849 --> 19:37.925
from Paul's Crab Shack
on D Street.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.360
I would but Paul's...

19:40.395 --> 19:43.064
is actually a great idea.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.557
Yeah, no, for sure.

19:44.592 --> 19:46.024
I think I have a menu upstairs.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.601
You wanna come help me
find it, Yerk?

19:47.637 --> 19:49.053
Okey-dokey.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.131
I could've sworn we had
a menu up here.

19:53.167 --> 19:55.884
I guess we threw it out
when Paul's Crab Shack

19:55.920 --> 20:00.280
went out of business
two years ago... Yerk.

20:00.315 --> 20:01.891
Or should I say jerk?

20:01.926 --> 20:04.844
Or should I say assassin?

20:04.879 --> 20:07.337
( American accent )
Wow, you caught me, KC.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.532
Looks like the party's over...
for you!

20:20.761 --> 20:22.253
Eight ball, corner pocket.

20:41.624 --> 20:44.208
Any last words before I haul
you off to prison, sucka?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.526
Just one.

20:46.562 --> 20:48.737
- Congratulations!
- Excuse me.

20:48.773 --> 20:50.572
- You passed your test.
- Test?

20:54.945 --> 20:57.038
This is a te...

20:57.073 --> 20:58.881
This is my test.

20:58.916 --> 21:00.291
I passed my test, guys!

21:09.526 --> 21:10.851
Congratulations, KC Cooper.

21:10.886 --> 21:13.153
You are now officially

21:13.189 --> 21:15.364
the youngest senior junior
special agent ever.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.674
In your face, Sarah.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.761
Yeah!

21:20.797 --> 21:22.415
I can't believe you guys
were in on this the whole time.

21:22.439 --> 21:24.431
I thought you were on to us.

21:24.467 --> 21:26.325
I should've been.
It all makes sense now.

21:26.402 --> 21:29.161
<i>I mean, Dad, since when
do you do yard work?</i>

21:29.196 --> 21:30.997
CRAIG: <i>Hey, it took
a lot of skill</i>

21:31.073 --> 21:32.734
<i>to get that branch to
fall onto the kitchen.</i>

21:32.758 --> 21:36.577
KIRA:<i> And that forced the
Goldfeders to move in with us.</i>

21:39.707 --> 21:41.799
KC: <i>And with Mrs. G. In my room,</i>

21:41.834 --> 21:43.892
<i>you guys knew I'd be distracted.</i>

21:43.928 --> 21:46.595
KIRA: <i>And moving
the pot luck to the house</i>

21:46.631 --> 21:49.373
<i>made it even harder for you
to identify your target.</i>

21:49.408 --> 21:51.016
And then Mom tried
to throw me off

21:51.051 --> 21:52.634
by making those
awful stuffed mushrooms.

21:52.669 --> 21:54.803
( Forced laugh )
Yeah. That was part of it.

21:56.807 --> 21:58.698
I still don't understand

21:58.734 --> 22:00.801
why you guys had to
make it so hard.

22:00.836 --> 22:03.270
Because, KC,
an agent has to function

22:03.305 --> 22:05.283
at a high level even when
their life isn't perfect.

22:05.307 --> 22:07.808
And we needed to know
that you would pass this test

22:07.844 --> 22:09.471
even when you're tired
or stressed out or distracted,

22:09.495 --> 22:11.312
and honey, you did.

22:11.347 --> 22:13.397
The one thing I can't figure out

22:13.432 --> 22:16.141
is if Yerk is actually an agent,

22:16.176 --> 22:17.568
then whatever happened
to Marisa's

22:17.603 --> 22:18.603
foreign exchange student?

22:27.129 --> 22:29.004
Yeah. Hot as a pocket.

22:32.226 --> 22:35.469
( Petey shrieking )

22:35.504 --> 22:37.855
Petey, if you're trying
to scare me again,

22:37.890 --> 22:41.108
get a new bit.
It is getting old.

22:41.143 --> 22:43.393
I have some big news.

22:43.428 --> 22:44.914
Mom's selling our house
and we're moving.

22:44.938 --> 22:46.814
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:49.293 --> 22:51.134
Wow. You know what?

22:51.169 --> 22:54.154
I'm actually gonna miss you.

22:54.190 --> 22:56.398
Don't worry. We'll be close by.

22:56.434 --> 22:58.742
In fact, we're moving in
with your family.

23:00.771 --> 23:04.581
I'll be with you forever.

23:07.286 --> 23:11.080
( Shrieking )
