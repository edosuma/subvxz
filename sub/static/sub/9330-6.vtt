00:03.142 --> 00:04.343
Morning, Tuck.

00:04.378 --> 00:05.927
Hey, did you hear that weird
high-pitched shriek last night?

00:05.963 --> 00:07.947
Kind of like a... a cat dying?

00:07.980 --> 00:09.914
Where's my cuddle bear?

00:09.949 --> 00:11.217
Oh, there you are!

00:11.250 --> 00:12.917
That's the one.

00:12.952 --> 00:14.285
Oh. Ben, hi.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.320
I don't suppose you'd believe

00:15.355 --> 00:17.189
I was just down here
borrowing a cup of sugar?

00:17.224 --> 00:18.207
Even though I kind of was.

00:19.326 --> 00:20.259
Just so you know,

00:20.309 --> 00:22.094
I'm not normally the kind of girl

00:22.096 --> 00:23.278
that does this sort of thing,
but ever since my divorce,

00:23.312 --> 00:25.114
I've just been trying
to get out there more.

00:25.164 --> 00:27.099
But ironically, out there is
really just the fourth floor.

00:27.134 --> 00:28.184
I'm so lucky to have my Tuckle-bear.

00:28.234 --> 00:30.036
I would be totally lost without him.

00:31.170 --> 00:33.072
Dude, how do you put up with her voice?

00:34.975 --> 00:35.941
Oh.

00:37.911 --> 00:38.860
I'm sorry, did you say something?

00:38.895 --> 00:39.844
(chortles)

00:39.896 --> 00:41.313
Asked and answered.

00:41.314 --> 00:43.883
So, are you and Sondra dating again?

00:43.917 --> 00:45.250
Dating? Please.

00:45.284 --> 00:47.902
She knocks on the pipes
whenever her ex has the kid

00:47.938 --> 00:51.189
and comes down to be Tucked into bed.

00:51.223 --> 00:53.125
Okay. Good to know.

00:53.127 --> 00:55.094
Is it? No. No, not at all.

00:55.128 --> 00:56.045
(phone rings)

00:58.164 --> 00:59.097
Hello?

00:59.100 --> 01:00.115
Yeah, this is Ben.

01:01.167 --> 01:02.100
What?

01:02.134 --> 01:03.868
Uh, yeah.

01:03.903 --> 01:05.004
Let me see if I can find her. Thanks.

01:05.055 --> 01:06.855
Dude, something's wrong with Riley.

01:06.890 --> 01:07.989
She didn't show up to work today. Here.

01:08.025 --> 01:09.875
Apparently, I'm still
her emergency contact.

01:12.344 --> 01:15.213
Hey, well, if she's
not dead, we need milk.

01:15.215 --> 01:17.132
- (door closes)
- But actually, we need it either way!

01:19.118 --> 01:20.085
Riley? Are you here?

01:20.137 --> 01:21.103
- Whoa! Oh!
- (Yelps)

01:24.307 --> 01:26.192
Oh, good, you're okay.

01:26.225 --> 01:27.225

01:38.938 --> 01:41.561
I just don't understand why
you're her emergency contact.

01:41.662 --> 01:43.579
And I just don't understand
why you don't understand

01:43.614 --> 01:44.614
how an alarm clock works!

01:44.698 --> 01:45.698
Oh, my God, I am so late.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.617
Dude, it's just an emergency contact.

01:48.668 --> 01:51.587
Calm down. It's not like my
name is tattooed on her ass.

01:51.621 --> 01:52.704
Although it could have been.

01:52.756 --> 01:53.789
We were in a relationship.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.341
Relationship?

01:55.375 --> 01:56.626
That's kind of a stretch, isn't it?

01:56.676 --> 01:57.759
Uh, no. We dated.

01:57.793 --> 01:58.793
So?

01:58.844 --> 02:00.629
She dated a lot of people.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.715
This, this is a relationship.

02:02.766 --> 02:06.551
Oh, so what you're saying is that
what I had with Riley doesn't count?

02:06.554 --> 02:07.602
Yeah, kinda.

02:07.638 --> 02:09.555
Oh, I see what this is.

02:09.556 --> 02:11.274
Yeah, you're just
jealous of what we had.

02:11.307 --> 02:13.643
Oh, so I'm jealous of nothing? Got it.

02:13.693 --> 02:14.727
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:14.728 --> 02:16.562
I'd like to say goodbye
to my girlfriend.

02:16.612 --> 02:17.646
(door slams shut)

02:20.317 --> 02:22.617
She's probably just in a rush
to change her emergency contact.

02:24.788 --> 02:25.788
Bonnie: "All I can say

02:25.822 --> 02:30.575
is Realtor Bonnie Wheeler
found me my dream home."

02:30.578 --> 02:31.711
There you go, Emma.

02:31.745 --> 02:33.746
Your very first online review.

02:35.716 --> 02:37.582
If this doesn't drum up more listings,

02:37.634 --> 02:39.668
Grandma's gonna need you
to tap dance in a bear suit

02:39.719 --> 02:41.721
while I hand out fliers in Times Square.

02:43.590 --> 02:44.639
Hey, Danny, oh, my gosh.

02:44.675 --> 02:47.593
I have some amazing news.

02:47.594 --> 02:48.644
Okay, get this.

02:48.679 --> 02:50.763
Out of all of the associates,
I was asked to give

02:50.813 --> 02:53.598
the retirement speech
for Bernard Bender,

02:53.600 --> 02:54.766
one of the firm's founding partners!

02:54.817 --> 02:56.686
- That's cool!
- Bigger.

02:56.736 --> 02:58.603
- That's amazing!
- Bigger.

02:58.655 --> 02:59.688
I am so proud of you!

03:01.574 --> 03:02.625
Are you talking about

03:02.675 --> 03:06.429
the legendary real estate
attorney, Bernard Bender?

03:06.462 --> 03:07.430
The King of Condos?

03:07.463 --> 03:08.431
The Crown of Downtown?

03:08.481 --> 03:09.448
The Lord of Slumlords?

03:10.500 --> 03:11.467
Where are you going with this?

03:11.501 --> 03:13.502
Oh, my God, if I could
get him as a client...

03:13.537 --> 03:15.288
And we're there. No.

03:15.322 --> 03:16.254
No, no, no, no.

03:16.306 --> 03:17.272
Mrs. Wheeler, please.

03:17.306 --> 03:18.290
He is a sweet,

03:18.324 --> 03:21.259
darling, old man who
occasionally mistakes me

03:21.311 --> 03:22.395
for his daughter...
Put those away!

03:22.429 --> 03:23.361
- Okay, fine!
- All right?

03:24.364 --> 03:25.615
No.

03:25.649 --> 03:27.616
You have to promise me that
you will stay away from him.

03:27.651 --> 03:29.301
(scoffs) What?

03:29.336 --> 03:30.652
I just want to meet him...

03:30.687 --> 03:32.570
shake his wallet... hand!

03:32.605 --> 03:33.706
I mean hand! Totally his hand.

03:33.707 --> 03:35.557
(groans)

03:35.591 --> 03:37.575
Okay, fine.

03:37.627 --> 03:41.479
I promise to stay away from him.

03:42.498 --> 03:43.549
- Good. Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:43.599 --> 03:46.401
All right, I am gonna
go work on my speech.

03:46.436 --> 03:47.485
I will... I'll see
you later, Danny?

03:47.521 --> 03:48.420
Bye!

03:50.356 --> 03:51.324
(door closes)

03:51.358 --> 03:52.341
What?

03:52.376 --> 03:54.393
I'm just trying to
figure out the loophole.

03:54.395 --> 03:57.629
See, you promised to stay away from him,

03:57.680 --> 03:59.781
but you didn't promise that
he'd stay away from you!

04:01.668 --> 04:03.436
Oh, my God, you are my son.

04:03.486 --> 04:04.486
Come here. I'm sorry.

04:08.675 --> 04:10.609
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben!

04:10.610 --> 04:12.561
We've got a problem.

04:12.596 --> 04:14.362
Is it that my best friend likes

04:14.397 --> 04:16.348
to walk around town
carrying a stuffed bear?

04:17.401 --> 04:19.451
Because I accept you anyway.

04:19.454 --> 04:21.387
- Though I'd rather you get rid of the bear.
- (Scoffs)

04:21.420 --> 04:24.322
No. And this was a gift...

04:24.324 --> 04:25.707
- from Sondra.

04:25.742 --> 04:28.293
<i>Sondra's voice: Happy one
month anniversary, Tuckle-bear!</i>

04:30.297 --> 04:32.564
Dude, she thinks we're dating!

04:32.598 --> 04:34.617
Why would she want to ruin a good thing

04:34.668 --> 04:36.468
with actual feelings?

04:36.519 --> 04:38.536
What am I supposed to do now?

04:38.572 --> 04:39.572
Here's a thought.

04:39.622 --> 04:41.557
Next time she bangs on
the pipes, don't bang back.

04:42.608 --> 04:44.492
Well, what about my pipes?

04:45.562 --> 04:47.413
Hey, Tuck...

04:47.447 --> 04:49.348
you think Riley and I
had something, right?

04:49.382 --> 04:50.348
Really?

04:50.384 --> 04:52.317
We can't have one conversation about me?

04:53.452 --> 04:55.353
It's like Danny wants to
pretend that what I had

04:55.389 --> 04:56.389
with Riley didn't even exist.

04:56.439 --> 04:58.740
Well, I guess I understand that.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.259
It's kind of like when
I gave my cousin my bike,

05:01.310 --> 05:02.694
and he wouldn't even let
me ride it once in a while.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.598
I just know that if
the roles were reversed,

05:06.649 --> 05:08.584
I would have the decency
to be jealous of him.

05:10.670 --> 05:13.406
They are, and you are.

05:14.473 --> 05:16.408
No, I am not! But he will be!

05:17.543 --> 05:19.495
Hey, guys! How's it goin'?

05:19.528 --> 05:21.480
Riles, I just got a text
from Abbey and Steve.

05:21.481 --> 05:21.869
Oh!

05:21.894 --> 05:23.440
Yeah, they were just
saying how much they miss us

05:23.466 --> 05:25.266
at Couples-Only Game Night,

05:25.317 --> 05:26.735
which you only get to
go to if you're a couple.

05:28.338 --> 05:29.687
Well, we should have them over!

05:29.723 --> 05:30.689
I love games!

05:30.690 --> 05:32.341
Oh, my God, how much fun would that be?

05:32.375 --> 05:33.759
Ben you have their number, right?

05:35.694 --> 05:36.711
It's in my phone.

05:36.747 --> 05:38.730
(laughter)

05:38.764 --> 05:40.566
- (laughing)
- Oh, my God.

05:40.617 --> 05:42.500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:42.502 --> 05:45.571
And that's why I have
dual citizenship in Guam!

05:45.622 --> 05:46.555
So...

05:48.557 --> 05:50.408
Mrs. Wheeler.

05:50.459 --> 05:52.343
Mr. Bender, hi.

05:52.379 --> 05:54.362
What an odd,
why-am-I-not-surprised surprise.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.413
What are you doing here?

05:55.415 --> 05:56.749
Oh, it's a funny story.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.733
Do you wanna tell it?

05:57.768 --> 05:59.317
- Eh.
- Okay, yeah, I'll tell it.

06:01.387 --> 06:03.656
So I came by to meet you for lunch...

06:03.658 --> 06:04.622
We weren't having lunch.

06:04.673 --> 06:06.257
I know. I forgot to invite you.

06:06.309 --> 06:08.543
And on my way out,

06:08.577 --> 06:10.629
Bendy here practically ran me over,

06:10.680 --> 06:12.648
and somehow, I ended up in his lap.

06:12.699 --> 06:14.550
Well, you know, one
thing led to another,

06:14.584 --> 06:16.601
and he insisted on
taking me out to lunch,

06:16.653 --> 06:18.353
so, well, here we are.

06:19.473 --> 06:20.422
So you kidnapped him.

06:21.524 --> 06:23.459
Isn't she hilarious?

06:23.492 --> 06:25.293
(louder) She's hilarious!

06:25.327 --> 06:26.444
Ha!

06:26.480 --> 06:28.297
(wheezes, coughs)

06:31.317 --> 06:32.668
Oh, my God, I love your laugh.

06:37.757 --> 06:38.757
It's done.

06:38.792 --> 06:40.692
Sondra will not be bothering us anymore.

06:40.744 --> 06:42.661
If you need help burying
the body, count me out.

06:42.711 --> 06:43.696
I hurt my back yesterday.

06:44.764 --> 06:46.649
No, man. I told her the truth.

06:46.682 --> 06:47.665
That I wasn't interested

06:47.716 --> 06:50.536
in anything more than
a physical relationship.

06:52.338 --> 06:54.355
Tucker, women don't
want to hear the truth.

06:54.406 --> 06:55.757
Well, I mean, I guess they probably do,

06:55.792 --> 06:57.308
but it's just safer not to.

06:58.444 --> 07:00.696
Dude, but she just kept
going on and on about how

07:00.747 --> 07:04.233
we're so right for each other
and how she feels so betrayed.

07:04.266 --> 07:05.317
I mean, at least that's
what I think she said.

07:05.401 --> 07:06.634
I had my earplugs in.

07:07.721 --> 07:09.672
God, some people just
don't know how to move on.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.557
Oh!

07:12.608 --> 07:13.526
That's what I should do!

07:13.576 --> 07:14.627
And we're back to you.

07:15.711 --> 07:17.463
I'm gonna show Danny

07:17.497 --> 07:18.581
that Riley hasn't completely moved on!

07:18.615 --> 07:19.632
But she has.

07:19.665 --> 07:21.516
- Well, you don't know that.
- But I do.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.535
You know what?

07:22.569 --> 07:24.420
I'm gonna find some old
photos of us together,

07:24.471 --> 07:26.372
leave them in her apartment
where Danny will see them,

07:26.406 --> 07:27.488
and then he'll think
she's still pining over me.

07:27.524 --> 07:29.257
But she's not!

07:29.292 --> 07:30.475
You don't know that!

07:30.509 --> 07:31.744
(knocking)

07:36.682 --> 07:37.716
Sondra, hi.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.334
- Look, I know this must be hard on y...
- Shh.

07:40.754 --> 07:42.288
It's my turn, Tuckle-bear.

07:42.322 --> 07:43.622
I was doing a lot of thinking

07:43.673 --> 07:45.524
while I was cutting up pictures of you.

07:45.526 --> 07:46.542
Um, I'm sorry,

07:46.576 --> 07:47.625
what's up with your voice?

07:48.677 --> 07:51.413
If you must know,
I've also been drinking

07:51.447 --> 07:54.399
and alcohol makes my voice
kind of low and annoying.

07:55.569 --> 07:57.369
You know what?

07:58.487 --> 08:00.406
I think you might have misunderstood

08:00.408 --> 08:02.341
what I was saying earlier.

08:02.375 --> 08:05.276
Let's talk about this over some wine.

08:05.312 --> 08:06.377
Yeah. In my room.

08:07.747 --> 08:09.665
Go ahead, girl! I'mma get you! Go!

08:09.699 --> 08:10.682
(chuckles)

08:17.290 --> 08:18.557
No, that's too obvious.

08:18.591 --> 08:19.507
Oh! Nightstand.

08:20.526 --> 08:21.509
What the hell are you doing?

08:21.543 --> 08:23.461
Riley! Hi! Uh...

08:23.495 --> 08:25.480
I was just looking for
something I dropped earlier.

08:25.514 --> 08:26.581
- Hey, what is that? Is that a picture of us?
- No.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.350
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

08:28.384 --> 08:29.401
- Yes, it is. Let me see it.
- No, it's not, Riley.

08:29.435 --> 08:30.485
- Just let go. No.
- Ben, let me see the picture!

08:30.519 --> 08:31.502
(both grunt)

08:31.538 --> 08:32.504
What the hell is going on?

08:32.554 --> 08:34.273
Dude, calm down.

08:34.323 --> 08:36.292
This is not what it looks like...

08:36.342 --> 08:37.725
but I completely understand
if you're jealous.

08:44.436 --> 08:45.452
I mean, are you actively

08:45.486 --> 08:47.303
trying to make Danny jealous?

08:47.355 --> 08:49.373
(sputters) No, that's ridiculous.

08:49.408 --> 08:50.374
You think it worked?

08:51.493 --> 08:54.260
No, because he's not, all right?

08:54.296 --> 08:55.261
But if you keep this up,

08:55.297 --> 08:57.280
I mean, you can kiss
our friendship goodbye.

08:57.315 --> 08:58.282
You want to kiss me goodbye?

08:58.283 --> 09:00.100
That would definitely
make Danny jealous.

09:01.135 --> 09:03.203
Ben, oh, my God. I am begging you.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.172
- Please! You cannot...
- Okay! Fine, fine, fine, fine!

09:05.206 --> 09:06.222
I'm sorry, okay? Calm down.

09:06.274 --> 09:07.191
I'm sorry.

09:07.241 --> 09:08.442
Forgive me?

09:08.493 --> 09:09.427
I'm sorry.

09:12.163 --> 09:13.114
Thank you.

09:13.164 --> 09:14.581
- It's just that...
- Oh, my... oh, my God.

09:14.633 --> 09:16.100
Oh, no, no, no! -My... my... my...
my hand! It... it's okay. It's fine.

09:16.150 --> 09:17.784
- No, don't pull it! It's gonna snag!
- It's caught on your shirt!

09:17.818 --> 09:19.419
- This is an expensive shirt!
- Hey, Riley, I was just wondering if you wanted to...

09:21.000 --> 09:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:29.346 --> 09:31.197
Hey, what's up, Danny?,

09:33.184 --> 09:34.150
Bonnie: What?

09:34.153 --> 09:36.136
You're a real estate attorney?

09:36.171 --> 09:38.087
I'm a real estate agent.

09:38.090 --> 09:41.040
With your money and
my sales associates...

09:43.094 --> 09:45.062
we would be unstoppable!

09:46.565 --> 09:49.133
You have kind eyes, Margaret.

09:49.134 --> 09:50.433
(chuckles)

09:50.436 --> 09:52.536
Again, it's Bonnie.

09:52.538 --> 09:54.053
But thank you.

09:55.474 --> 09:57.290
So do you...

09:57.325 --> 09:59.426
in a bloodshot, cataracty sort of way.

10:01.363 --> 10:04.215
I'm being honored at a banquet.

10:04.216 --> 10:05.381
Will you come as my date?

10:06.400 --> 10:08.201
What do you say, Beatrice?

10:10.172 --> 10:14.124
Well, I say let's party like it's 1899!

10:14.158 --> 10:15.142
Yeah!

10:15.177 --> 10:17.193
Or whatever year you're from. So...

10:17.245 --> 10:19.547
All right, you know, I'm gonna
go get us some more drinks, okay?

10:19.597 --> 10:21.130
Here you go.

10:21.133 --> 10:22.066
Yeah.

10:23.150 --> 10:25.134
Tucker, I just got the craziest idea.

10:25.169 --> 10:26.086
(whispering)

10:27.172 --> 10:28.105
Damn, girl!

10:28.155 --> 10:30.090
I'm gonna need different shoes for that!

10:31.426 --> 10:34.461
Uh-oh, I can see the
bottom of my wine glass.

10:34.495 --> 10:36.379
(chuckles)

10:36.381 --> 10:37.413
I'm on it.

10:40.519 --> 10:42.403
Mrs. Wheeler.

10:42.437 --> 10:44.288
How's it going with Father Time?

10:46.173 --> 10:48.192
Oh, can you ask him what
happened to the dinosaurs?

10:48.193 --> 10:49.210
Oh. (scoffs)

10:49.244 --> 10:51.128
Yeah, like you're any better.

10:51.178 --> 10:54.498
Trying to muzzle that
pterodactyl with chardonnay.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.150
Hey, hey, she is getting
herself drunk, all right?

10:57.184 --> 10:58.536
What am I supposed to do?

10:58.538 --> 11:00.120
Not sleep with someone

11:00.171 --> 11:02.489
whose sober voice makes me want
to go cordless bungee jumping?

11:04.341 --> 11:05.392
And what am I supposed to do?

11:05.427 --> 11:08.278
Not seduce one of the most
powerful men in real estate

11:08.280 --> 11:09.263
to further my career?

11:12.333 --> 11:14.350
- We're horrible people.
- Yes.

11:14.385 --> 11:16.153
Yes, we are.

11:16.154 --> 11:17.288
- Well, you in particular.
- What?

11:18.340 --> 11:20.190
Well, what do you think we should do?

11:20.225 --> 11:22.091
Say a few "Hail Marys,"
do a couple of shots,

11:22.126 --> 11:23.092
and pretend we're cool with it?

11:24.578 --> 11:26.080
In the meantime,

11:26.114 --> 11:27.463
Bendy just invited me to a hot party.

11:27.466 --> 11:28.481
- Do you want to come?
- Open bar?

11:28.515 --> 11:29.466
- You know it.
- We'll be there.

11:34.121 --> 11:35.371
Oh, hey, Tuck.

11:35.423 --> 11:36.373
About to head out.

11:36.423 --> 11:37.457
Oh. Away game?

11:37.491 --> 11:38.475
Yeah, just for us.

11:38.476 --> 11:40.311
The other team's playing at home.

11:42.413 --> 11:44.264
But you're gonna miss Riley's speech.

11:44.298 --> 11:45.249
That's okay.

11:45.299 --> 11:46.417
She practiced on me this morning.

11:46.418 --> 11:49.202
You're probably gonna wish
you had an away game too.

11:49.254 --> 11:51.171
I'm gonna go grab a quick
shower before I take off.

11:51.206 --> 11:52.155
All right.

11:58.163 --> 11:59.129
(pipes banging)

11:59.163 --> 12:02.066
Aah. The pipes.

12:02.116 --> 12:03.484
I'll take this one...

12:05.403 --> 12:07.370
Should probably take these too.

12:07.373 --> 12:08.389
(door opens)

12:08.423 --> 12:10.256
Knock, knock. Oh, hey, Tuck.

12:10.307 --> 12:11.357
- Is Danny here?
- Yeah. He's in the shower.

12:23.171 --> 12:24.120
(shower running)

12:27.192 --> 12:28.192
Ben:
What the...

12:28.243 --> 12:29.176
- (Riley screams)
- (Ratting, thump)

12:31.513 --> 12:32.495
Seriously?

12:32.529 --> 12:35.099
Danny! Hey...

12:35.100 --> 12:36.399
Riley: Oh,
Dan... Wait!

12:38.436 --> 12:40.303
- Ugh.
- (Door slams shut)

12:40.355 --> 12:41.471
- Been working out?
- Get off of me.

12:48.677 --> 12:50.115
Uh, what the hell are you doing here?

12:50.215 --> 12:51.538
Oh, I just came to show my support

12:51.639 --> 12:53.524
and thought I'd send Danny a
few snaps from your big event.

12:53.575 --> 12:54.741
- You want to get in one?
- Oh, my God. Stop.

12:54.793 --> 12:56.559
Ben, this has to stop.

12:56.594 --> 12:57.977
Riley, this isn't even about you.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.562
Oh, my God! I know.

12:59.596 --> 13:01.465
You know what? It's never about me.

13:01.515 --> 13:02.932
It is always about you.

13:02.934 --> 13:04.868
You know what? For
once, it would be great...

13:04.918 --> 13:07.571
no, grand, no, spectacular...

13:07.605 --> 13:09.789
if it could be about me!

13:09.841 --> 13:12.442
Do you have any idea how
hard this has been for me?

13:12.494 --> 13:13.876
- Riley, it's not...
- Hard, Ben!

13:13.879 --> 13:14.878
The answer is hard.

13:16.815 --> 13:19.799
Do you know how many
age-appropriate single men

13:19.850 --> 13:21.652
there are in Manhattan?

13:21.702 --> 13:23.821
130,000!

13:23.855 --> 13:25.639
Yep, I looked it up!

13:26.857 --> 13:28.658
Could I have fallen for,
like, one or two of those guys?

13:28.710 --> 13:32.578
Oh, no. I got to fall
in love with brothers!

13:32.614 --> 13:33.580
And instead of being mature

13:33.630 --> 13:36.482
and realizing how
crazy this situation is,

13:36.518 --> 13:37.868
you are trying to destroy me!

13:37.918 --> 13:38.869
Why, Ben? Why?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.520
Why can't you just let me be happy?

13:40.554 --> 13:42.956
Oh, my God, that felt so good
to get that all out at once.

13:45.994 --> 13:47.911
Now that you spell it all
out, I can kinda see how

13:47.946 --> 13:49.846
this could be a little stressful for ya.

13:49.849 --> 13:51.664
Oh, could you?

13:53.817 --> 13:55.686
Ben, please.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.671
I am begging you...

13:57.721 --> 13:59.523
to be the amazing guy

13:59.573 --> 14:01.457
that I know you can be and just...

14:02.644 --> 14:04.461
let me move on.

14:05.629 --> 14:06.596
You're right.

14:06.630 --> 14:08.565
And I promise I won't
be a problem anymore.

14:10.501 --> 14:11.802
(exhales) Thank you.

14:11.852 --> 14:12.970
Well, that's good.

14:12.971 --> 14:15.855
So, um, can you help me
find your mom and Mr. Bender?

14:15.889 --> 14:16.923
He's the one with her claws in him.

14:20.745 --> 14:21.794
I'll have another beer.

14:21.846 --> 14:23.647
And for you, m'lady?

14:23.697 --> 14:24.780
Oh, nothing for me, Tuckle-bear.

14:24.783 --> 14:26.600
My drinking days are over!

14:26.634 --> 14:27.634
What?

14:27.684 --> 14:28.684
No. No, no, no.

14:28.687 --> 14:30.703
Come on, girl. Nobody likes a quitter.

14:30.754 --> 14:33.506
Well, I've just been
drinking way too much lately.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.691
Hello, wagon. Meet this girl.

14:34.741 --> 14:35.676
This girl is off the hooch.

14:35.710 --> 14:37.543
"Hooch" is a funny word, right?

14:37.595 --> 14:38.705
I had a cousin named Hooch.
He was a riot.

14:38.730 --> 14:39.504
Think I'll have a double.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.548
He was this giant man with a tiny
chihuahua with the worst gas ever.

14:41.582 --> 14:42.682
Oh, my God, I really want to get a dog,

14:42.716 --> 14:43.933
but I don't know if I want
a big dog or a small dog.

14:43.967 --> 14:44.902
You know, we can name it Stinky.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.036
You know, he named
his dog Stinky because

14:46.070 --> 14:47.888
his gas was really stinky
made this funny sound,

14:47.922 --> 14:50.774
so it'd be, like, he'd be funny and be
laughing but he'd also be smelling it

14:50.775 --> 14:52.042
and be like, "Ooh, that's Stinky,"

14:52.043 --> 14:53.177
so he'd be laughing and gagging
and laughing and gagging.

14:53.211 --> 14:54.695
There's, like, this whole
new word called "gagging."

14:54.729 --> 14:55.778
I don't think...
No, it's "gaughing."

14:55.812 --> 14:56.996
Is "gaughing" a word?
I don't think gaugh...

14:57.048 --> 14:58.664
Did you know that you can make
a new word in the dictionary

14:58.716 --> 14:59.765
if you just tell them a word and then
tell them the meaning of the word?

14:59.817 --> 15:00.767
If they think it's a good enough word,

15:00.817 --> 15:01.735
they'll just add it to the dictionary.

15:02.787 --> 15:05.772
Don't they make motorized wheelchairs?

15:05.822 --> 15:08.591
Last time I pushed this
long, I went home with a kid.

15:09.677 --> 15:10.677
Bonnie, wait.

15:10.727 --> 15:12.495
I... I need your help.

15:12.529 --> 15:13.663
Oh, you want me to help you

15:13.666 --> 15:15.432
with your new Wall Street project

15:15.482 --> 15:16.517
by giving me the exclusive listing?

15:16.567 --> 15:17.868
- Oh, Bendy!
- I can't...

15:17.918 --> 15:19.536
I can't believe it either!

15:19.586 --> 15:20.604
My... my heart.

15:20.638 --> 15:22.471
Well, my heart is as full as yours!

15:22.474 --> 15:23.490
I know!

15:23.541 --> 15:24.541
I'm... I'm dying.

15:24.576 --> 15:26.475
I'm dying to start working with you too!

15:26.510 --> 15:27.476
Oh, Bendy!

15:27.479 --> 15:29.779
My girls and I are forever grateful!

15:29.813 --> 15:31.815
Oh, my God!

15:31.849 --> 15:32.816
Oh, gosh!

15:34.818 --> 15:36.669
Bendy?

15:36.721 --> 15:37.687
Mr. Bender?

15:38.773 --> 15:40.624
Are you...

15:40.625 --> 15:41.625
are you okay?

15:41.626 --> 15:42.643
Are you? Huh?

15:42.693 --> 15:44.711
Oh, God! No! God!

15:44.745 --> 15:46.580
Oh, my God. Okay, listen, all right?

15:46.630 --> 15:49.533
Um, you just stay here and
I'm gonna go get some help.

15:49.567 --> 15:50.918
God, why didn't you say anything?

15:52.003 --> 15:53.503
Don't go into the light!

15:57.591 --> 15:59.493
Mr. Bender! There you are.

15:59.527 --> 16:01.427
Everyone has been looking for you,

16:01.461 --> 16:03.429
so let's get you in there.

16:10.888 --> 16:13.774
- What are you doing?
- I brought these!

16:13.825 --> 16:15.658
What are you doing here?
What happened to your game?

16:15.710 --> 16:16.759
I left right after the final buzzer

16:16.793 --> 16:18.678
so I could be here for my girlfriend.

16:18.712 --> 16:19.696
What are you doing here?

16:19.746 --> 16:21.631
It's called friendship, Danny.

16:21.634 --> 16:23.649
You know what? Look, I'm sorry.

16:23.684 --> 16:26.452
I'll take my salt and pepper shakers

16:26.504 --> 16:28.471
and my sugar caddy
and I'll be on my way.

16:28.474 --> 16:29.523
Good idea.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.541
No, no, no. Bad idea. Ben, sit down.

16:31.543 --> 16:32.808
Danny, take my seat, okay?

16:32.844 --> 16:34.778
No one is leaving until after my moment.

16:34.779 --> 16:35.912
I... I mean...

16:35.963 --> 16:37.880
(louder) after Mr. Bender's moment!

16:37.883 --> 16:38.865
Okay.

16:40.951 --> 16:43.720
Oh, my God, there you are.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.688
You had me freaking out.

16:45.740 --> 16:47.790
For a second there, I
actually thought you were...

16:49.726 --> 16:50.693
Yeah, that.

16:51.745 --> 16:53.713
I am gonna knock you dead, sir.

16:53.748 --> 16:56.616
(laughs) Not gonna be that hard.

16:56.650 --> 16:59.602
Um, don't you think you've
had enough to drink, Tucky?

16:59.636 --> 17:02.438
No, because I can still hear you.

17:02.472 --> 17:03.407
What's that supposed to mean?

17:04.459 --> 17:06.526
It means the more I drink,

17:06.560 --> 17:07.560
the better you sound.

17:11.516 --> 17:13.450
Ahem. Hello. Hi. Hi, everyone.

17:13.483 --> 17:15.751
If I could please have your attention.

17:15.752 --> 17:16.886
We are here to celebrate

17:16.938 --> 17:19.704
a man so full of life.

17:19.740 --> 17:21.758
His very presence lights up a room.

17:21.759 --> 17:24.611
Bernard Nathaniel Bender.

17:24.694 --> 17:25.578
(applause)

17:28.615 --> 17:30.599
Well, you don't have
to hear this voice again

17:30.634 --> 17:31.667
because you know who I'm done with?

17:31.670 --> 17:33.603
You!

17:33.637 --> 17:34.621
Oh!

17:34.655 --> 17:36.640
I'm sorry, sir. Did she get you too?

17:36.673 --> 17:38.592
Oh, excuse me.

17:38.643 --> 17:40.493
Sir?

17:40.528 --> 17:42.496
Holy crap! This guy's dead!

17:42.547 --> 17:43.596
- (all gasp)
- Oh, my Lord!

17:43.647 --> 17:45.882
He's just died at this very moment

17:45.916 --> 17:47.834
right now in front of everyone!

17:47.868 --> 17:48.919
Stand back! I know CPR!

17:48.970 --> 17:50.854
- Yeah, so do I!
- What's your problem?

17:50.855 --> 17:51.855
This isn't a competition!

17:51.905 --> 17:53.039
Oh, really?

17:53.074 --> 17:54.807
'Cause I'm pretty sure you
make everything a competition!

17:54.842 --> 17:56.692
You guys really think
it's a good time for this?

17:56.743 --> 17:57.794
Excuse me, excuse me.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.646
We have a dead guy at table three!

18:00.698 --> 18:01.731
I already said I was sorry!

18:01.782 --> 18:02.749
Sorry for what?

18:02.799 --> 18:03.799
Grabbing my girlfriend's boob

18:03.835 --> 18:05.602
or me catching you in the shower?

18:05.604 --> 18:06.653
Wasn't the first time for either!

18:06.688 --> 18:08.538
Oh, you're a dead man.

18:08.573 --> 18:10.557
No, no, no, no. This,
this is a dead man!

18:10.590 --> 18:12.491
Oh, he's going down!
He's going down, people!

18:12.527 --> 18:14.153
Can't you just for one second
admit that you're jealous?

18:14.180 --> 18:14.560
Jealous?

18:14.595 --> 18:16.913
I'm only jealous of people who
don't have you as a brother!

18:16.948 --> 18:18.498
- Oh, it's on!
- It's not...

18:18.548 --> 18:19.499
(screams)

18:19.549 --> 18:20.517
Riley!

18:20.550 --> 18:22.486
Riley: Oh, yep, he's definitely dead.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.472
Oh, my God.

18:27.825 --> 18:29.710
Riley killed Mr. Bender.

18:30.961 --> 18:32.729
- Who wants to split a cab?
- I do.

18:32.730 --> 18:33.697
Okay.

18:39.686 --> 18:40.753
Hey.

18:40.805 --> 18:41.721
Hey.

18:43.607 --> 18:44.574
(sighs)

18:44.608 --> 18:45.541
We need to talk.

18:47.528 --> 18:49.546
I really am sorry about this whole mess.

18:49.579 --> 18:52.598
I was being childish
and immature, and...

18:52.650 --> 18:55.951
I just wanted you to admit that
I had meant something to Riley.

18:57.555 --> 19:00.740
I wanted just for once for
you to be jealous of me.

19:02.460 --> 19:03.759
Oh, my God.

19:03.761 --> 19:05.444
Don't you get it?

19:05.480 --> 19:07.413
I was lying.

19:07.448 --> 19:09.415
Ben, I've watched the girl of my dreams

19:09.467 --> 19:11.468
be in love with you for two years.

19:11.501 --> 19:12.853
Every time she held your hand,

19:12.886 --> 19:15.855
every time she kissed you
and not me, it killed me.

19:16.941 --> 19:18.892
I'm tired of feeling jealous.

19:18.942 --> 19:20.777
I just want to get past this.

19:20.811 --> 19:21.894
But I won't let you.

19:28.486 --> 19:30.737
Maybe it's because I never thanked you.

19:30.788 --> 19:31.821
For what?

19:31.824 --> 19:34.458
For what you did at mom's wedding.

19:34.491 --> 19:36.826
If it wasn't for you, there
would be no Riley and me.

19:36.877 --> 19:39.880
And I know that that was probably the
hardest thing that you've ever done.

19:41.798 --> 19:42.798
So, thanks, bro.

19:43.884 --> 19:44.917
Oh.

19:44.969 --> 19:46.836
So, I'm kind of the hero in this story?

19:46.838 --> 19:47.837
- I'm good with that.
- Yeah.

19:47.888 --> 19:48.888
(chuckles)

19:50.508 --> 19:51.842
Look, Danny...

19:51.893 --> 19:53.759
please trust me when I say

19:53.810 --> 19:55.729
I am truly happy that
you're with Riley now.

19:58.516 --> 19:59.816
How's she doing?

20:00.852 --> 20:01.902
Eh, she'll be fine.

20:02.987 --> 20:04.738
Has she been working out?

20:04.771 --> 20:05.855
Yeah, man. She has.

20:08.859 --> 20:09.859
Don't tell her we did that.

20:15.265 --> 20:18.067
Got a fresh stack of fliers

20:18.166 --> 20:20.167
and the world's cutest assistant.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.086
Okay, Emma. Can you show
me that dance we practiced?

20:23.137 --> 20:24.255
Come on, show it.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.257
Yes! All right!

20:26.307 --> 20:28.058
All right.

20:28.093 --> 20:30.144
Let's go drum up some
business for grandma!

20:30.179 --> 20:32.012
Come on, sweetie.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.148
Hey. What's going on?

20:35.183 --> 20:36.183
Nothing.

20:36.185 --> 20:38.185
Just getting Emma ready for Halloween.

20:38.188 --> 20:40.104
- Oh, cute.
- Mm-hmm.

20:40.154 --> 20:41.189
Let's hit Times Square, sweetie.

20:43.107 --> 20:44.075
Wait a minute.

20:44.108 --> 20:45.108
(door closes)

20:45.160 --> 20:46.160
Halloween's not for six months.

20:46.194 --> 20:48.278
Mom? Mom!
