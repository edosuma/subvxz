00:48.520 --> 00:49.555
Go!

00:53.240 --> 00:54.229
Go!

00:58.200 --> 00:59.269
What's that?

01:00.040 --> 01:01.109
It's a man!

01:02.240 --> 01:04.071
- What? Is he dead?
- No, sir.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.872
He's writing!

01:06.120 --> 01:07.075
Repeat!

01:07.720 --> 01:08.630
He's writing,

01:08.800 --> 01:11.519
sir, he's writing in a notebook!

01:11.760 --> 01:14.672
That man was not mad.
He was working

01:14.840 --> 01:18.469
with shrapnel whistling round him
because he couldn't wait.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.280
The contents of that notebook
were too important

01:21.440 --> 01:22.998
to write it down later.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.799
He had to do it
when his mind dictated,

01:25.960 --> 01:28.428
he couldn't put it off
a single second.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.831
What was so important that
he would risk his life for it?

01:33.360 --> 01:36.238
What was he writing that
stopped him from standing up

01:36.400 --> 01:38.152
and running, like any other man
would have done?

01:42.520 --> 01:45.671
The "Tractatus
Logico-philosophicus",

01:48.040 --> 01:51.589
the most influential philosophical
work of the twentieth century.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.032
That soldier was called
Ludwig Wittgenstein,

01:55.200 --> 01:57.760
the man who set the limits
on our thoughts.

01:58.680 --> 02:01.274
The enigma that
he tried to decipher

02:01.920 --> 02:03.148
was the following:

02:07.160 --> 02:09.594
Can we know the truth?

02:12.400 --> 02:14.152
All the great thinkers
throughout history

02:14.320 --> 02:15.992
have sought a single certainty,

02:16.160 --> 02:17.991
something which
no one can refute,

02:18.160 --> 02:20.549
like "two and two make four".

02:21.640 --> 02:23.471
In order to find that truth,

02:23.640 --> 02:25.471
Wittgenstein used, in fact,

02:25.640 --> 02:29.792
mathematical logic. What better
means of obtaining a certainty

02:29.960 --> 02:33.350
than an immutable language,
free from the passions of men?

02:34.800 --> 02:38.634
He advanced slowly,
using equation after equation,

02:38.800 --> 02:41.439
with impeccable method,
until he reached

02:41.640 --> 02:43.358
a terrifying conclusion.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.628
There is no such truth

02:47.880 --> 02:50.075
outside of mathematics.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.158
There is no way of finding

02:52.320 --> 02:54.595
a single absolute truth,

02:54.760 --> 02:56.557
an irrefutable argument

02:56.720 --> 02:59.917
which might help answer
the questions of mankind.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.392
Philosophy,
therefore, is dead.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.714
Because "Whereof we cannot speak,

03:10.640 --> 03:13.154
thereof we must be silent."

04:33.880 --> 04:35.438
Don't touch that, please.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.393
This is an Enigma machine!

04:37.560 --> 04:40.916
Just a copy. The original's in
the Imperial War Museum in London.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.870
Sorry to sneak in like that...
The door was open.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.589
Of course it was open. You surely
didn't expect me to get up

04:47.760 --> 04:49.239
and let you in
on these legs, did you?

04:49.680 --> 04:50.635
I'm...

04:50.840 --> 04:56.392
Martin, our new overseas
student lodger, I presume.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.790
- This man in the photo with you...
- Yes.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.951
That's Turing, Alan Turing,

05:02.560 --> 05:04.835
the man who deciphered
the Enigma code.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.992
Thanks to him, we won the war.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.196
Poor man died
such a strange death...

05:11.080 --> 05:13.992
a poisoned apple, like Snow White.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.519
And the one on the left?

05:16.680 --> 05:18.591
My husband, Harry.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.797
Harry Eagleton. He developed the
concept of fractional dimensions...

05:21.960 --> 05:24.997
He deserved a bloody Nobel prize,
but he hated sucking up

05:25.160 --> 05:27.549
to politicians.
Politicians or anybody.

05:27.720 --> 05:28.994
He never had many friends.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.195
He had one at least.
Arthur Seldom.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.430
Poor boy. He spent day

05:34.600 --> 05:37.273
after day in the house,
tidying Harry's papers.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.955
He'd go without lunch or dinner,
going over the equations.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.275
Eagleton tutored his doctoral thesis
on the logical series. In 1960,

05:45.440 --> 05:48.318
- wasn't it?
- I see you've done your homework.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.949
I know everything there is
to know about Arthur Seldom.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.315
In fact, Mrs. Eagleton,
it's because of him that I'm here.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.993
In Oxford, I mean.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.593
I know what you mean.
Seldom is... unique.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.238
Every prize,
every acknowledgement

06:01.400 --> 06:05.598
he's received over the years
has been a real joy for me.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.516
Careful, mother, or
your secret will be discovered.

06:08.680 --> 06:09.715
What secret?

06:09.880 --> 06:11.472
After daddy died,
you tried to marry him.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.473
How dare you!
That's not true.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.914
He's always been
like a brother to me.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.957
Only because there was no chance
of him being anything else.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.155
Beth!

06:20.080 --> 06:21.991
There's no doubt
Professor Seldom is a genius,

06:22.160 --> 06:24.276
but there's one area
he's no different from other men.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.753
He likes young girls.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.515
Beth, darling, couldn't you stop
being so spiteful just for a second?

06:30.680 --> 06:31.795
Sorry, mother.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.673
Take no notice of us.
We're like two bitter old spinsters.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.911
Thank you, mother, for tarring me
with the same brush.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.830
I'm sorry,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.115
you are?

06:42.400 --> 06:44.914
I sent a fax a few weeks ago,
about renting a room.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.718
Ah, our overseas student.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.518
Why don't you
show him to his room?

06:51.320 --> 06:52.833
If I'd known,
I'd have rented a tux.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.474
You look stunning.

06:54.720 --> 06:56.915
My daughter has
a concert tonight. That's all.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.276
A concert?

06:58.440 --> 07:00.715
I play the cello
in the Sheldonian.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.996
- It's the local amateur orchestra.
- Yes.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.435
We're not quite
the London Symphony.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.715
I... I love the cello.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.077
Me too. Maybe it's because
it's all I get to cuddle

07:10.240 --> 07:11.309
- these days.
- Beth.

07:11.480 --> 07:12.833
Please.
You'll scare the young man.

07:13.000 --> 07:13.955
Mother.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.191
My daughter's suitors
tend not to be

07:16.360 --> 07:17.679
around very long.

07:17.840 --> 07:18.989
Difficult character, you know.

07:19.560 --> 07:22.393
Having an old lady hovering in the
doorway doesn't exactly help either.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.915
Are you calling me a busybody?

07:25.080 --> 07:27.389
No, mother. You just want
to protect me, don't you?

07:27.920 --> 07:29.035
Of course.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.429
My mother has this theory

07:30.600 --> 07:32.716
that unless a man lived
through the Second World War

07:32.880 --> 07:34.313
he's not to be trusted.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.196
My daughter

07:35.440 --> 07:36.395
thinks I've gone a bit

07:36.560 --> 07:37.788
gaga, but she knows

07:37.960 --> 07:38.756
I'm right.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.351
The Nazis changed the wheels

07:41.520 --> 07:44.432
on that damned machine
every bloody day,

07:44.600 --> 07:47.990
that altered the code, and we
had to decipher it all over again.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.631
There were no computers
in those days,

07:51.040 --> 07:53.429
calculations were done by hand.

07:54.520 --> 07:55.839
You must have been very young.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.149
Time for me to go.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.519
Fancy a game of Scrabble?

08:13.320 --> 08:15.515
Well, this is your study.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.757
I trust you'll be comfortable.

08:17.920 --> 08:18.955
It's perfect.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.588
You should also be thinking
of a supervisor

08:21.760 --> 08:22.749
for your thesis.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.832
I've had one in mind
for a long time; Arthur Seldom.

08:29.920 --> 08:30.955
Your parents?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.109
Yeah.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.875
Very American.
Is it close to the beach?

08:36.039 --> 08:39.794
Not at all.
It's the desert, Arizona.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.513
It actually happens to be my home.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.675
Really? Lovely.

08:45.560 --> 08:46.629
Anyway...

08:46.840 --> 08:48.193
all the studies are shared.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.790
Your colleague is
also an overseas student.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.518
I'm sure we'll get on fine.

08:53.040 --> 08:53.950
By the way,

08:54.120 --> 08:58.079
I think you'll find Professor Seldom
only works as a researcher now.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.473
I know, but the college told me that
he could supervise my doctorate.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.039
Who told you that?

09:03.400 --> 09:05.118
I've got a fax...

09:05.360 --> 09:06.031
here.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.755
I see.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.518
I'm sorry to say Mrs. Keeman

09:13.800 --> 09:15.711
was being rather over-optimistic.
Also,

09:15.880 --> 09:17.029
she no longer works here.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.430
But there must be some way,
perhaps if I speak to him...

09:19.760 --> 09:20.954
You're free to talk
to whoever you want,

09:21.120 --> 09:24.908
of course, but I must
warn you Professor Seldom

09:25.080 --> 09:27.833
is not one for
this sort of spontaneity.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.558
If you take my advice,

09:29.720 --> 09:32.632
I suggest you approach your studies
in a more realistic way.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.678
I'm sure you'll find some excellent
tutors among our teaching staff

09:35.960 --> 09:38.918
who will more than understand
the nature of your work.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.751
- Don't take it out on the wall.
- Walls?

10:01.360 --> 10:03.635
Don't talk to me about walls. That's
all you get in this fucking city.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.556
Sorry, just letting off
a little steam.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.473
Well, at least they come in
handy for doing your homework.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.593
These? I was just trying to save
myself 16 years of practice.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.638
See, I'm trying to calculate
where I need to run,

10:17.920 --> 10:19.069
depending on where
the ball bounces,

10:19.240 --> 10:20.832
and what height it makes contact

10:21.000 --> 10:21.637
with my racquet.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.271
Makes it easier. Here.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.393
See? It works.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.597
Yeah, and what would happen
if you played against a person?

10:37.640 --> 10:38.993
There would be more variables

10:39.200 --> 10:42.112
but it would still be possible
to work out the trajectory.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.835
Please.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.874
Give me time.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.590
I have to rethink my calculations.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.355
Okay.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.755
Thanks for the beating.

11:41.480 --> 11:42.833
Do you want to continue
letting off steam

11:43.000 --> 11:44.353
on your own
or do you prefer company?

11:46.240 --> 11:47.878
Wednesday, same time?

11:48.120 --> 11:51.669
Yes. Bring a proper squash racquet.
Makes life much easier.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.715
Okay.

12:04.120 --> 12:07.237
I see you're picking up
the local customs very quickly.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.674
I try my best.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.637
Maybe she can help you
with your doctoral thesis,

12:10.800 --> 12:12.995
since uncle Arthur
is out of the question.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.753
- Can nothing be done?
- No.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.074
And if you're suggesting my mother
have a word with him, forget it.

12:18.680 --> 12:19.954
I wasn't suggesting anything.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.478
Do you really expect me to believe
you chose this house by chance?

12:24.440 --> 12:26.351
No, not by chance, no.

12:26.760 --> 12:27.909
Nothing happens by chance.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.718
I wanted to meet
your mother, that's true,

12:29.920 --> 12:31.717
but I never planned to use her.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.518
There's no need to apologize.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.236
I like people who
go for what they want.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.799
I wish I was more like you.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.231
You're not missing much,
I assure you.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.628
Oh, really?

12:41.800 --> 12:44.109
You come here from another country,
all on your own,

12:44.280 --> 12:46.510
and no sooner do you get here
than you make friends with a girl.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.429
With two, I hope.
At least that's what I thought

12:49.600 --> 12:51.955
- until a moment ago.
- It's not just that.

12:52.440 --> 12:53.509
You're happy,

12:54.640 --> 12:56.073
you only have to look at
your face to see that.

12:56.560 --> 12:57.675
I try to be.

12:57.840 --> 12:58.955
How do you do it?

13:00.120 --> 13:01.155
It's easy.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.514
It's a case of going
with the flow.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.193
And what if it goes badly?

13:08.240 --> 13:10.071
I'd rather make mistakes
than do nothing.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.789
I'd rather mess up
than miss out completely.

13:13.640 --> 13:14.789
It works for me.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.714
You should try it.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.475
Just a minute!

13:33.280 --> 13:34.838
I thought you might
find this interesting.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.718
Seldom is giving a lecture
on his latest book

13:36.880 --> 13:38.632
at Merton College on the 24th!

13:38.800 --> 13:40.279
There's your big chance!

13:42.360 --> 13:44.794
There is no way
of finding a single

13:44.960 --> 13:48.316
absolute truth, an irrefutable
argument that might help to answer

13:48.480 --> 13:50.357
the questions of mankind.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.358
Philosophy,
therefore, is dead.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.838
Because "Whereof we cannot speak,

14:00.720 --> 14:03.393
thereof we must be silent."

14:18.080 --> 14:21.117
Oh, it seems that
someone does wish to speak.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.193
It appears you are not
in agreement with Wittgenstein.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.469
That means either you have found
a contradiction in the arguments

14:29.640 --> 14:33.315
of the Tractatus, or you have an
absolute truth to share with us all.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.630
I believe in the number Pi.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.394
I'm sorry,
I didn't understand you.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.073
What was it
you said you believed in?

14:44.240 --> 14:48.392
In the number Pi, in the Golden
Section, the Fibonacci Series.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.028
The essence of nature
is mathematical.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.271
There is a hidden meaning
beneath reality.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.275
Things are organized following
a model, a scheme, a logical series.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.434
Even the tiny snowflake

14:59.600 --> 15:02.433
includes a numerical basis
in its structure. Therefore,

15:02.600 --> 15:05.956
if we manage to discover
the secret meaning of numbers,

15:06.120 --> 15:08.475
we will know
the secret meaning of reality.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.315
Impressive!

15:18.480 --> 15:19.913
Translating his words into

15:20.080 --> 15:21.195
the Queen's English,

15:23.240 --> 15:24.514
we find ourselves
faced with a fresh,

15:24.720 --> 15:27.757
rousing defence of mathematics,
as if numbers

15:27.920 --> 15:30.309
were pre-existing ideas in reality.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.915
Anyway, this is nothing new.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.233
Since man is incapable
of reconciling mind and matter,

15:36.400 --> 15:39.551
he tends to confer
some sort of entity on ideas,

15:39.720 --> 15:42.917
because he cannot bear the notion
that the purely abstract

15:43.080 --> 15:45.548
only exists in our brain.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.555
The beauty and harmony
of a snowflake.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.195
How sweet!

15:57.440 --> 15:58.475
The butterfly

15:58.640 --> 16:00.119
that flutters its wings

16:00.280 --> 16:03.158
and causes a hurricane
on the other side of the world.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.154
We've been hearing about
that damn butterfly for decades,

16:06.320 --> 16:10.279
but who has been able
to predict a single hurricane?

16:16.120 --> 16:17.439
Nobody!

16:22.360 --> 16:23.509
Tell me something...

16:24.320 --> 16:27.995
Where is the beauty
and harmony in cancer?

16:28.840 --> 16:30.637
What makes a cell

16:30.800 --> 16:33.189
suddenly decide to turn itself
into a killer metastasis

16:33.360 --> 16:36.716
and destroy the rest of
the cells in a healthy body?

16:38.440 --> 16:39.668
Does anyone know?

16:42.440 --> 16:43.475
No.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.595
Because we'd rather think
of snowflakes

16:46.760 --> 16:48.830
and butterflies than of pain,

16:49.560 --> 16:50.788
war

16:51.320 --> 16:52.992
or that book.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.394
Why?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.834
Because we need to think
that life has meaning,

17:00.360 --> 17:03.033
that everything
is governed by logic

17:03.200 --> 17:05.236
and not by mere chance.

17:06.200 --> 17:10.796
If I write 2 then 4 then 6,
then we feel good, because we know

17:10.960 --> 17:12.518
that next comes 8.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.079
We can foresee it,

17:14.599 --> 17:16.477
we are not in the hands

17:16.640 --> 17:17.834
of destiny.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.231
Unfortunately, however,

17:22.560 --> 17:25.632
this has nothing to do with truth.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.398
Don't you agree?

17:31.160 --> 17:32.070
This...

17:33.720 --> 17:35.039
is only fear.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.354
Sad...

17:42.320 --> 17:43.548
but there you go.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.196
You must

17:55.440 --> 17:56.998
be Martin.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.958
At last we meet.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.715
But, I don't get it,
are you leaving?

18:01.880 --> 18:04.917
Yes, I'm leaving. It was a mistake.
It was all a big mistake.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.989
Things have not turned out
as you expected, I guess.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.549
No, they haven't.
You bet they haven't.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.872
I hope the hastiness
of your decision

18:14.040 --> 18:15.029
has nothing to do with

18:15.200 --> 18:16.110
Professor Seldom.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.038
News travels fast in Oxford.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.998
We are a little village of gossips.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.952
Anyway, I think you are wrong
about the great sage.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.676
He was the best in his day, but...

18:28.840 --> 18:31.752
now he just wants to sell books.
Like those assholes.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.194
A real Seldom fan, eh?

18:34.480 --> 18:36.471
I have a framed photo
of him in my room.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.868
So he refused you too?

18:39.120 --> 18:42.396
I would rather jump out of
a window than ask him for help.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.597
I want nothing to do
with him or his books.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.597
I prefer the Reader's Digest.

19:19.000 --> 19:19.876
Taxi!

19:38.400 --> 19:39.037
Hello.

19:39.240 --> 19:42.038
Ah, we've got
the book you wanted!

19:45.120 --> 19:46.235
There.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.473
Fucking hell!

21:29.040 --> 21:30.234
What are you doing here?

21:30.760 --> 21:32.034
I live here.
What's your excuse?

21:33.400 --> 21:35.391
I came to visit an old friend.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.793
I'm sorry about before.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.632
No, don't apologize.
I talked a lot of rubbish.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.199
I tend to overact
when I have an audience.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.158
The truth is I just wanted
to attract your attention.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.994
You succeeded.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.239
September the 24th,

21:56.400 --> 21:58.960
1993. Inspector Petersen,
Oxford police station.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.351
Investigating the murder
of Mrs. Julia Eagleton.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.918
According to this report,
you and Professor Arthur Seldom

22:06.080 --> 22:08.833
discovered the body...
at the same time.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.910
Yes, we entered
the room together.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.034
Are you one of
Professor Seldom's students?

22:15.600 --> 22:16.555
No.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.716
- Do you work for him?
- No.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.110
Can you explain
why you were there together?

22:22.280 --> 22:23.269
No.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.758
To tell you the truth, I can't.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.959
I was also surprised
to see him there.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.435
So it was pure coincidence?

22:32.600 --> 22:34.909
Everything seems to point
to that being the case.

22:37.120 --> 22:41.398
And was this the first time
you'd seen Professor Seldom?

22:41.560 --> 22:45.075
Not exactly. I was at
a conference he gave this morning.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.673
I asked him a few questions.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.309
What sort of questions?

22:49.800 --> 22:50.869
Mathematical ones.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.871
It's not by chance that I went

23:02.040 --> 23:03.393
to Mrs. Eagleton's house
this afternoon.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.230
I went there because
the murderer told me to.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.913
The murderer warned you?

23:08.560 --> 23:11.597
Yes, I received a note
during the conference.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.273
What did it say?

23:13.680 --> 23:14.908
Just one sentence:

23:15.600 --> 23:17.033
"The first of the series,"

23:17.480 --> 23:20.074
written in capital letters.
Underneath,

23:20.520 --> 23:22.351
Mrs. Eagleton's address

23:22.880 --> 23:24.074
and the time.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.833
Can we see it?

23:26.760 --> 23:27.670
No.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.309
Why?

23:30.400 --> 23:31.549
I threw it away.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.076
You threw away
a vital piece of evidence?

23:37.280 --> 23:39.475
Yes, well, let me explain.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.152
After the conference,

23:42.320 --> 23:45.232
I signed a number of copies.
When I'd finished, I set off home.

23:46.200 --> 23:50.273
And that is when I realized
that the address on the note

23:50.440 --> 23:51.759
was familiar

23:52.400 --> 23:54.118
but honestly, I...

23:54.280 --> 23:58.398
it just never occurred to me that
anything like this could happen.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.350
Of course, when I got there,
it was too late.

24:14.600 --> 24:15.874
We should call the police.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.115
You're right.

24:18.640 --> 24:19.709
Call them.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.799
999.

24:23.960 --> 24:24.915
Hello,

24:25.080 --> 24:27.071
I'm calling to report a death.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.678
3 Cunliffe Close.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.709
It's an old woman.

24:33.920 --> 24:34.875
Thank you.

24:36.480 --> 24:37.754
What do you think happened?

24:38.200 --> 24:39.315
I don't know.

24:39.960 --> 24:42.269
We should wait outside.
We'd better not touch anything.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.953
I shouldn't have
even used this phone.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.317
Try to etch on your memory
everything you can see.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.516
This moment is crucial.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.831
She was playing Scrabble
when it happened.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.195
Was she playing on her own?

24:53.680 --> 24:56.353
Yes, she has both
the letter racks on her side.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.353
You don't think she's been killed?

24:59.920 --> 25:01.638
I can't see any other alternative.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.670
Whoever did this obviously
intended to smother her

25:07.880 --> 25:09.029
with the cushion
while she was sleeping.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.838
She wakes up, puts up a struggle,

25:11.080 --> 25:13.548
he presses down harder,
using both hands perhaps,

25:13.720 --> 25:16.075
breaks her nose, hence the blood.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.959
Or it could have been a woman,

25:18.120 --> 25:20.475
using her knee
to add extra pressure.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.795
When the killer removes
the cushion, sees the blood,

25:23.960 --> 25:25.473
he drops it on the carpet
and doesn't even bother

25:25.640 --> 25:27.198
to put anything back in its place.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.713
Scared, probably.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.070
In the book

25:32.240 --> 25:35.312
that I based my conference on,
I unfortunately

25:35.680 --> 25:39.116
compare logical series
with serial murders.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.750
And since its publication
I've received

25:41.920 --> 25:43.433
dozens of totally absurd letters,

25:43.600 --> 25:45.192
which is why I attached
little importance to this one.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.551
And you're sure you destroyed it?

25:48.360 --> 25:51.318
Well, no, I threw it away
in the street.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.469
Where?

25:55.360 --> 25:57.078
Well, somewhere near
the Sheldonian Theatre.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.993
Scott, get on to it,
it might still be there.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.718
The road sweepers
will have passed through by now.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.952
It doesn't matter. We'll search
the dust carts, if necessary.

26:05.560 --> 26:09.269
Now is there anything else? Anything
else that caught your attention?

26:09.440 --> 26:11.954
Oh, uh, under the text

26:12.800 --> 26:14.711
there was a hand-drawn circle,

26:15.960 --> 26:17.473
a perfect circle,

26:18.920 --> 26:20.512
also in black.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.268
About...

26:25.880 --> 26:27.632
this size,

26:29.520 --> 26:30.635
approximately.

26:32.560 --> 26:33.675
A circle?

26:34.520 --> 26:35.635
Like a signature?

26:35.840 --> 26:37.910
Oh no, I'm almost convinced
it was a symbol,

26:38.080 --> 26:39.957
the first element
of a logical series.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.997
Well, excuse my ignorance,

26:43.200 --> 26:45.873
I must have been off school
the day they taught

26:46.040 --> 26:47.189
logical series.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.114
A logical series

26:49.280 --> 26:50.838
is a group of elements
that succeed one another,

26:51.040 --> 26:52.268
following a particular rule.

26:52.440 --> 26:53.509
Could be 1, 2, 3, 4...

26:53.680 --> 26:55.989
or even numbers, 2, 4, 6, 8...

26:56.800 --> 26:59.234
Or of course it could be
the Fibonacci series.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.079
Fibonacci?

27:01.240 --> 27:02.639
A 12th-century mathematician.

27:02.800 --> 27:07.112
Each element is the sum of the two
previous ones: 1, 1, 2, 3, 6,

27:07.280 --> 27:09.840
- 8, 13...
- Look, I still don't see

27:10.000 --> 27:12.833
the relationship between
the murder and these series.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.310
I'm sorry. In my book I sustain
the theory that the murder committed

27:16.520 --> 27:19.512
for intellectual reasons
does not exist in the real world.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.432
In general, the patterns
followed by a serial killer

27:23.600 --> 27:26.990
are crude, monotonous
and repetitive,

27:27.160 --> 27:30.311
cases that can be analyzed
psychologically, not logically.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.995
So you think the murderer is
killing to prove something to you?

27:34.880 --> 27:37.713
Yes, sadly, I believe
that to be the case.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.639
Murderer wants to prove me wrong.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.518
He wants to show that
he's more intelligent than I am

27:41.680 --> 27:43.033
and that he can beat me

27:43.200 --> 27:46.192
at my own game.
Somehow he knew of my friendship

27:46.360 --> 27:49.716
with Mrs. Eagleton,
and decided to begin there.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.314
How about this circle?
How do you explain this?

27:52.600 --> 27:55.034
Oh, a circle's a good way
to start a logical series.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.713
There's no symbol
more indeterminate.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.399
Could mean almost anything.

27:58.560 --> 28:02.348
So you mean there's gonna be
another murder after this one?

28:02.680 --> 28:03.874
I'm afraid so.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.598
And if we don't
discover it in time,

28:07.920 --> 28:09.558
could be many more.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.312
Okay, we are going to change

28:11.480 --> 28:13.835
some notes please in part 12.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.508
We knew she was going
to die at any time,

28:17.440 --> 28:18.873
but never like this.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.118
The doctors gave her 6 months
to live, 6 years ago.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.552
Thanks to Beth's nursing
she had an extra lease of life,

28:26.040 --> 28:27.439
like a blessing from heaven.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.357
Maybe that's why
the murderer chose her.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.674
How do you mean?

28:32.960 --> 28:35.349
If he is trying to demonstrate
something purely intellectual,

28:35.520 --> 28:37.829
maybe the deaths in themselves
don't interest him.

28:38.040 --> 28:40.838
Maybe his aim is to inflict
as little harm as possible.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.036
He chose someone
that should have died.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.430
He probably knew Mrs. Eagleton
was receiving treatment...

28:45.600 --> 28:47.795
She went every week
to St Joseph's hospital.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.270
He could have found out about her
illness there, and that made her

28:51.440 --> 28:53.158
the perfect victim for him.

28:53.480 --> 28:54.515
Go on.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.352
If he hadn't broken her nose,

28:57.520 --> 28:59.590
it would have looked
like death by natural causes.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.836
In that case, only you
would have known what happened.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.592
The police would never
have been involved.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.796
It would have been
a private challenge.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.752
A murder that almost isn't a murder.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.512
That makes sense.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.233
What do you think
he would do next?

29:12.920 --> 29:15.036
I suppose he'll try
to be more careful.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.273
He'll commit another murder
that almost isn't a murder.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.154
An imperceptible murder...

29:26.960 --> 29:28.109
Excuse me.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.388
Excuse me, officers,
but I need to speak

29:35.560 --> 29:37.198
to Miss Eagleton first,
to break the bad news,

29:37.360 --> 29:39.510
to her, if that's all right.
Thank you.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.319
You have a C,

29:47.480 --> 29:50.199
B flat, and C sharp.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.078
Excuse me, please,
I can talk to him?

29:52.240 --> 29:54.913
Yes, so

29:55.080 --> 29:56.399
you have a C, B flat,

29:56.560 --> 29:57.879
and C sharp.

29:59.440 --> 30:02.273
Oh, no, no, no. You have a B,
a C sharp, and C natural...

30:03.360 --> 30:04.349
Oh, okay,

30:04.920 --> 30:06.478
let's do a break, please.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.195
The police told me that you
were the one who found the body.

30:42.360 --> 30:43.952
Forgive me, Beth.
I'm really sorry.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.076
They asked me to try
and remember every detail and...

30:46.240 --> 30:49.073
It's no problem.
I understand.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.077
It must have been difficult
for you to go through all of this.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.071
Two hours of interrogation.

30:57.400 --> 31:00.073
It's logical, though, bearing
in mind I'm the chief suspect.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.389
Did they tell you that?

31:01.560 --> 31:04.120
No. No, they didn't have to.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.674
You don't need to be
a detective to realize

31:06.840 --> 31:08.592
that I'm the one who
most benefits from all this.

31:08.760 --> 31:11.991
But you looked after her
for years. Seldom told me.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.189
Five years...

31:14.920 --> 31:17.309
Five years of waiting
for her to drop dead.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.272
Forgive me for being
so cruelly sincere,

31:20.440 --> 31:22.510
but if anyone wanted this
to end, it was me.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.435
Do you know what it is
to wake up every morning

31:28.600 --> 31:31.068
wondering when you're going
to have a life of your own?

31:31.720 --> 31:34.029
I couldn't abandon her,
she was my mother.

31:34.880 --> 31:38.077
She had cancer but it was supposed
to be a question of months.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.399
You want this person you're supposed
to be looking after to disappear

31:43.560 --> 31:44.675
and at the same time you know

31:44.840 --> 31:46.239
there's something evil in you
for thinking that way.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.349
You hate yourself

31:49.520 --> 31:51.112
for the thoughts
that go through your head.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.479
It's like being rotten inside.

31:53.640 --> 31:56.108
Beth, you've no need to worry.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.194
Seldom got a note.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.669
Someone warned him of
what was going to happen,

32:00.840 --> 32:03.195
- and is threatening to do it again.
- Who?

32:03.360 --> 32:04.588
No one knows.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.316
They made me go to the morgue
to look at the body.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.278
Her eyes were still open.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.714
Don't think about it.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.715
I don't think I can sleep
upstairs tonight.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.638
Is it okay
if I stay here with you?

32:40.440 --> 32:41.668
I'm sorry.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.558
Don't be... it's okay.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.437
I don't know what you must
think of me. I'm so embarrassed.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.432
Beth, please. Don't go.

33:04.760 --> 33:07.991
Congratulations! Your name
in the papers and with Seldom!

33:08.160 --> 33:10.958
Knock off the old lady
to attract attention, did you?

33:11.120 --> 33:12.678
Not so fast!

33:13.800 --> 33:15.233
Your friend is lucky.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.633
Always close to death,
but never touched by it.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.629
Didn't you know?

33:22.120 --> 33:23.314
Thirty years ago,
the four of them

33:23.480 --> 33:25.994
- were travelling together.
- What are you talking about?

33:26.160 --> 33:29.550
Mrs. Eagleton's husband
and Seldom's wife were killed.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.478
And guess who was driving.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.149
And now the old lady is dead.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.631
Three down, one to go.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.558
This is Miss Scarlet

33:42.720 --> 33:45.029
and she is in the dining room.
Now we know that the murder

33:45.200 --> 33:46.076
took place in the dining room,

33:46.240 --> 33:48.151
don't we? And that the victim
was killed with a cushion,

33:48.320 --> 33:49.389
but since we don't have

33:49.560 --> 33:51.710
a cushion, we'll use
the nasty little knife.

33:53.520 --> 33:54.350
Now I'll stick

33:54.520 --> 33:56.476
my neck out and say that
Miss Scarlet was the murderer

33:56.640 --> 33:58.551
in the living room,
with the knife.

33:59.720 --> 34:00.789
What do you think?

34:00.960 --> 34:03.076
Clue didn't figure
into my degree course.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.309
Cleudo!

34:05.560 --> 34:06.993
It's recommended reading
in police academies.

34:08.400 --> 34:09.594
In the papers,

34:10.440 --> 34:12.954
Beth appears as the chief suspect.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.473
But the police know all the facts.

34:16.560 --> 34:20.393
Ah, I forgot that I was talking
to the champion of universal logic.

34:20.800 --> 34:21.755
Thank you.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.636
You and the police think that it's
possible to demonstrate the truth.

34:26.000 --> 34:26.670
On the basis

34:26.840 --> 34:28.795
of certain axioms
and by using valid reasoning,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.434
you can reach a valid conclusion,
isn't that so?

34:31.600 --> 34:33.750
As sure as today is Wednesday.

34:33.920 --> 34:37.196
And what if I say,
"All Britons are liars"?

34:38.199 --> 34:40.475
True, false
or impossible to prove?

34:41.000 --> 34:43.467
All right. There are
mathematical formulations

34:43.639 --> 34:46.279
that can neither be proved
nor refuted starting from axioms.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.112
Indeterminable propositions.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.918
Exactly, Gödel's
incompleteness theorem.

34:51.159 --> 34:53.435
So, even in your world
of mathematical purity,

34:53.600 --> 34:55.750
there are things
that can never be proven.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.956
Yes, but that is not the case here.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.114
There is a gap,

35:01.160 --> 35:04.755
there is a gulf between
what is true and what is provable.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.234
We can never be sure

35:06.400 --> 35:08.118
of all the facts about a phenomenon,

35:08.280 --> 35:11.238
and to lack just one, could change
everything. Even if we know

35:11.400 --> 35:12.310
that the murder

35:12.480 --> 35:14.232
took place in the dining room
with the knife,

35:14.440 --> 35:17.398
and that Miss Scarlet was there
at the exact moment of the murder,

35:17.560 --> 35:19.630
and that her fingerprints

35:19.800 --> 35:21.074
were on the knife,
we can never

35:21.240 --> 35:24.118
affirm with absolute certainty
that she committed the crime.

35:24.280 --> 35:27.750
Oh, come on! It's
99% probable, for fuck's sake!

35:28.840 --> 35:31.877
That's not absolute certainty,
that is an opinion.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.678
We could have absolute certainty

35:33.840 --> 35:34.955
if we trusted the word
of an eye-witness,

35:35.120 --> 35:38.317
or we saw it with our own eyes.
I trust my own eyes.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.114
No comment.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.880
Things are here, under our noses.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.395
These paving stones. They exist!

35:46.560 --> 35:48.152
Or do you refute that
as well? You can't.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.880
Are you sure? Heisenberg
wasn't quite as certain.

35:51.720 --> 35:52.948
The physicist?

35:53.120 --> 35:55.315
Yes, well, he tried to make
an atom bomb for the Nazis,

35:55.480 --> 35:56.629
but he wasn't famous for that.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.917
What is this? An exam? Heisenberg's
"uncertainty principle".

36:00.080 --> 36:03.390
Bingo! Miss Scarlet
is now an electron, okay?

36:03.560 --> 36:05.198
And you're looking at her
through a keyhole,

36:05.360 --> 36:07.237
or a particle accelerator,
as you wish.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.628
And every time you look at her,

36:08.800 --> 36:12.270
Miss Scarlet will have
changed her appearance or...

36:12.840 --> 36:13.750
her position.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.752
Because the very fact
that you observe her

36:15.960 --> 36:18.315
alters her atomic state.
How about that?

36:18.560 --> 36:20.278
Don't try to confuse me with tricks.

36:20.440 --> 36:23.079
Beth is not an electron,
and neither is Mrs. Eagleton.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.435
So, do you really think
that criminal investigation

36:25.600 --> 36:27.750
is more reliable
than physics or mathematics?

36:27.920 --> 36:30.070
There are evident,
irrefutable facts.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.839
For Christ's sake,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.389
can you turn that bloody thing
off for a minute?

36:40.040 --> 36:42.838
Unfortunately, the police
were unable to find the note.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.878
Consequently, we have
no material evidence whatsoever.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.712
Not a thing!

36:48.280 --> 36:49.998
Imagine if that bloody psychopath

36:50.160 --> 36:52.515
gets the wind up
and decides not to kill again...

36:52.960 --> 36:55.474
Beth will be declared guilty.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.235
I'd love to know
who it is you hate so much.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.669
Myself.

37:05.800 --> 37:08.553
I read the news in the papers.
You're not to blame for anything.

37:09.080 --> 37:10.479
The worst thing is...

37:11.120 --> 37:12.599
This is embarrassing...

37:13.320 --> 37:15.709
Thanks to that
poor woman's death,

37:15.880 --> 37:17.279
I've just had lunch
with Arthur Seldom.

37:17.440 --> 37:20.750
Before, he didn't
even know I existed, but now...

37:21.040 --> 37:22.598
I'm sorry about what

37:22.800 --> 37:26.952
has happened but at the same time,
I swear I can't help feeling happy.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.675
Never, in my life, have I
enjoyed myself so much.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.509
One hour with Seldom is like
a lifetime with anybody else.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.557
Well, you know,

37:36.720 --> 37:38.438
there's nothing embarrassing
about sincere feelings.

37:39.600 --> 37:40.828
Are you sure about that?

37:46.200 --> 37:47.792
Spend an hour with me?

38:16.360 --> 38:17.873
You have something to drink?

38:18.240 --> 38:19.514
- No.
- Great.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.751
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, are you okay?

39:07.800 --> 39:08.869
What's wrong?

39:09.040 --> 39:10.996
Nothing, it's... Sorry.

39:11.720 --> 39:12.709
It's Seldom.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.757
Just strange that you should
have read this book too.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.753
- A nurse interested in mathematics.
- Well, not really.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.519
It was the author who interested me.
He gave it to me.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.151
- You know Seldom?
- Of course I do.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.992
- See him almost every day.
- What?

39:28.320 --> 39:30.356
He visits a friend
at the hospital,

39:30.600 --> 39:32.079
a terminal patient.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.911
One day we began to chat and...

39:35.080 --> 39:36.115
And what?

39:37.000 --> 39:38.592
And he gave me the book.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.675
- That's all?
- You're jealous?

39:41.840 --> 39:45.116
He could be yourfather... Your
grandfather, come to think of it.

39:45.280 --> 39:46.269
Yeah.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.036
I just like mystery novels,

39:50.400 --> 39:52.356
he was here for a while,
we had a laugh,

39:52.520 --> 39:54.795
I gave him a couple of my books
and he gave me his.

39:55.120 --> 39:57.839
- Is that a crime?
- No... Of course not.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.471
Can you get him out of your mind,

40:04.520 --> 40:05.157
please?

40:06.160 --> 40:08.310
I just don't understand why
you didn't tell me to begin with.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.435
What do you want?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.911
A list of all the people
who have passed through here?

40:14.720 --> 40:16.392
- No.
- Good.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.114
Everything you read
in the papers is a lie.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.349
Did you know that?

41:26.280 --> 41:27.679
No, uh...
I don't pay much attention.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.796
- Have you read the Bible?
- Not all of it.

41:30.280 --> 41:33.750
Jesus died on the cross
and then rose on the third day.

41:33.960 --> 41:35.234
But in body and soul,

41:35.960 --> 41:37.279
at least so they say.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.348
He ate fish and spoke to Peter.

41:40.520 --> 41:42.590
That's how he spent forty days.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.154
Forty days!

41:44.480 --> 41:47.358
He must have been green,
and have stunk to high heaven.

41:48.360 --> 41:49.759
Hey, wait, wait.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.239
Jesus was a terrorist.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.479
All his life.

41:56.600 --> 42:00.673
A revolutionary who kicked
money changers out of the temple.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.552
Do you know why
he came back from the dead?

42:03.720 --> 42:06.234
- No, theoretically...
- Jesus

42:06.560 --> 42:09.358
came back to life to avenge
himself on his murderers.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.509
Like in a horror movie.

42:12.760 --> 42:16.036
Of course, that's not nice.
That's not interesting.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.278
You can go in now,
your daughter

42:19.440 --> 42:20.475
- is expecting you.
- All right.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.513
What are you doing here?

42:26.680 --> 42:29.797
I had the urge to see you,
that's all. Do you mind?

42:30.360 --> 42:31.475
You're lying.

42:31.640 --> 42:32.709
How do you know?

42:33.000 --> 42:34.558
I didn't, I do now.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.356
You're here to see
Seldom's friend, aren't you?

42:37.520 --> 42:39.875
You should have seen the look
on your face when I mentioned him.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.557
And how are you going to explain
what you're doing here?

42:42.920 --> 42:44.592
I'll tell him I came to see you.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.429
You swine.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.637
Who is that guy?
He's nuts.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.389
Well, you would be too
if your daughter needed a transplant

43:04.560 --> 43:06.039
and you couldn't find a donor.

43:06.320 --> 43:07.833
There were two people
that could have been compatible,

43:08.000 --> 43:09.479
but their families refused.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.949
Now I get it.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.679
You know, he thought
of committing suicide

43:12.840 --> 43:14.751
in order to give her his lungs.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.433
That's ridiculous.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.910
Giving your life for someone
you love is ridiculous?

43:22.840 --> 43:23.875
His name is Kalman,

43:24.040 --> 43:25.758
one of my most brilliant students.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.069
He was quick in his conclusions,

43:27.240 --> 43:28.389
clear in his exposition.

43:28.920 --> 43:31.673
He designed intelligence tests.
I initiated him

43:31.880 --> 43:34.110
into the study of logical series.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.236
He was meticulous,
to the point of obsession.

43:36.400 --> 43:37.913
He marked the tests himself,

43:38.080 --> 43:39.354
one by one, and discovered

43:39.520 --> 43:40.794
something really curious:

43:40.960 --> 43:43.838
some of the tests were perfect;
the majority had a few mistakes.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.434
But there was a third group.

43:46.600 --> 43:48.511
The answers were absurd,
incomprehensible,

43:48.720 --> 43:49.869
illogical, random,

43:50.040 --> 43:51.917
the sort of thing
that a lunatic would write.

43:52.080 --> 43:53.149
Kalman interviewed

43:53.320 --> 43:54.799
the pupils of this third category.

43:55.280 --> 43:57.157
The answers that
he had considered absurd

43:57.440 --> 43:59.715
were, in fact,
another possible solution

43:59.880 --> 44:00.710
and perfectly valid

44:00.880 --> 44:01.915
to continue the series,

44:02.080 --> 44:04.799
only with an infinitely
more complex justification.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.111
The intelligence
of these pupils

44:07.280 --> 44:09.874
went beyond
the conventional solution and was

44:10.040 --> 44:11.393
much more far-reaching.

44:14.120 --> 44:17.078
It was then that I had
to break the bad news to him.

44:18.160 --> 44:21.152
Wittgenstein's paradox
concerning finite rules.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.352
Kalman found in practice

44:23.520 --> 44:25.272
what Wittgenstein
discovered decades before.

44:25.440 --> 44:26.589
The series 2, 4, 8,

44:26.760 --> 44:27.909
could obviously be followed

44:28.080 --> 44:30.469
by 16, but also by 10

44:30.800 --> 44:32.631
or 7004.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.594
It's always possible
to find a rule,

44:35.760 --> 44:37.352
a justification which allows

44:37.520 --> 44:39.636
a series to be continued
by any number.

44:40.240 --> 44:42.071
It all depends on
how complicated the rule is.

44:42.240 --> 44:45.073
Suddenly, he realized
that he couldn't even trust

44:45.240 --> 44:45.911
the two times table.

44:46.120 --> 44:48.714
His whole life was being
sucked into a whirlpool

44:48.880 --> 44:50.438
of meaningless numbers.

44:50.600 --> 44:53.319
Normal thought seems to be
guided by certain grooves

44:53.480 --> 44:55.311
etched into our brain

44:55.480 --> 44:56.993
which impede
our leaving that track

44:57.160 --> 44:58.798
and jumping it like the chosen few

44:58.960 --> 45:01.235
who are able to think
without limitations.

45:01.400 --> 45:03.755
Kalman decided
to take a strange path.

45:03.920 --> 45:05.512
He began to try out his tests

45:05.680 --> 45:08.399
in psychiatric hospitals,
on lobotomized patients.

45:08.560 --> 45:10.118
There was a remarkable similarity

45:10.280 --> 45:11.918
between those symbols

45:12.080 --> 45:13.433
and the results of the tests

45:13.600 --> 45:14.794
of the highly-gifted subjects.

45:15.200 --> 45:17.350
He was in the presence
of pure thought,

45:17.520 --> 45:18.999
without grooves,

45:19.520 --> 45:21.636
but he couldn't understand it.
The problem

45:21.800 --> 45:23.119
was his own brain.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.875
He saw everything from the outside.
To understand

45:26.040 --> 45:28.156
those symbols, he had
to see them from the inside.

45:28.320 --> 45:32.996
There was only one way of
achieving it: to erase the grooves.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.952
The idea might seem grotesque,

45:35.120 --> 45:36.599
but not to a person
who has been told

45:36.760 --> 45:38.751
that he's suffering
from terminal cancer.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.359
His bones were rotting like wood

45:40.520 --> 45:42.192
infested with woodworm.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.231
All he had to look forward to

45:44.400 --> 45:46.960
was the amputation
of his limbs, one by one.

45:47.800 --> 45:51.190
He was euphoric, he laughed,
nervously, like someone about

45:51.400 --> 45:54.312
to discover something incredible
who can't contain his joy.

45:54.480 --> 45:55.310
It was then

45:55.520 --> 45:57.795
that I realized that my friend
had gone completely mad.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.513
He wanted to lobotomize himself.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.557
His only problem
was how to ensure

46:02.720 --> 46:04.836
that the brain damage
was not excessive.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.272
He had to perforate
the skull and reach

46:07.440 --> 46:08.839
the brain, with something like

46:09.000 --> 46:10.069
a small harpoon.

46:11.120 --> 46:13.076
He asked for my help
and I refused,

46:13.400 --> 46:16.631
although I did promise I would try
to collect the messages he wrote

46:16.800 --> 46:18.028
from the other side.

46:18.320 --> 46:20.197
He used a nail gun.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.079
What does he write?

46:25.560 --> 46:27.551
The symbols are becoming
more and more illegible.

46:28.080 --> 46:31.709
In all this time he's never drawn
a logical symbol or a number.

46:31.880 --> 46:33.438
So what are they, then?

46:33.640 --> 46:36.712
Four letters that
he repeats over and over.

46:38.080 --> 46:39.229
A woman's name.

46:53.080 --> 46:54.593
Where were you last night?

46:55.040 --> 46:56.439
Beth, what are you doing here?

46:56.600 --> 46:58.352
I was waiting for you.

46:59.360 --> 47:00.679
I'm sorry. I was out and...

47:00.840 --> 47:03.308
I thought you felt
something for me.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.428
More than pity,

47:07.000 --> 47:08.353
but I was wrong.

47:08.920 --> 47:11.036
Of course I feel something
for you. We're friends.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.428
I want to help you, but...

47:12.600 --> 47:14.875
"We're friends,
you want to help me".

47:15.840 --> 47:17.353
That's worse than saying
"you disgust me".

47:17.680 --> 47:19.079
- Beth, please.
- Don't touch me!

47:22.560 --> 47:23.959
The kinder you try to be,

47:24.120 --> 47:25.917
the more humiliated I feel.

47:26.680 --> 47:28.352
Beth, I don't mean to humiliate you.

47:28.760 --> 47:32.753
Then treat me like a woman. You all
treat me like I was a little girl.

47:32.960 --> 47:33.995
Maybe this isn't the time for...

47:34.160 --> 47:36.071
Now is the fucking
perfect time for this, Martin.

47:38.960 --> 47:40.029
What's the matter?

47:41.320 --> 47:43.390
You're embarrassed to be seen
with me? Is that it?

47:43.640 --> 47:45.278
Don't worry.
I'm his mother.

47:45.480 --> 47:47.471
I'm just making sure
he does his homework.

47:47.640 --> 47:48.356
Be quiet!

47:50.000 --> 47:51.228
Beth, wait!

48:01.280 --> 48:02.474
Found your killer yet?

48:27.440 --> 48:31.115
Lorna? It's me, Martin. Do you know
anything about Seldom's friend?

48:31.280 --> 48:33.555
Kalman?
What's wrong?

48:33.800 --> 48:35.597
He's been murdered.
Today, at two fifteen.

48:36.360 --> 48:37.952
No... Wait a second.

48:50.280 --> 48:51.998
Sorry, Sherlock,
but he's alive.

48:52.160 --> 48:53.229
Are you sure?

48:53.400 --> 48:54.913
Yes, he's right in front of me.

48:55.080 --> 48:57.389
If it's not him, then who?

48:59.040 --> 49:01.349
It would have looked like
death from natural causes,

49:01.520 --> 49:03.795
if we hadn't discovered
this little detail.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.398
It's an intravenous injection,

49:06.640 --> 49:08.915
and he wasn't receiving
that kind of treatment.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.274
What sort of poison
was administered?

49:10.440 --> 49:12.829
We don't know. We'll have to wait
for the post mortem report.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.319
We know the time of death?

49:14.480 --> 49:16.038
Exactly as it said on the note:

49:16.240 --> 49:17.719
quarter past two.
It says so

49:17.880 --> 49:19.598
- on the wristband.
- Where did they find the body?

49:19.760 --> 49:22.149
In the ward,
before it was brought here.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.949
All of these people
have died in the last few hours?

49:25.120 --> 49:28.669
Well, it's only to be expected.
This is the terminal illnesses ward.

49:29.120 --> 49:30.678
At least a couple
of patients die every day,

49:30.840 --> 49:32.319
according to
the senior nursing officer.

49:32.480 --> 49:34.630
He knew my movements,
which encouraged him

49:34.800 --> 49:35.676
to commit the crime here.

49:35.840 --> 49:38.991
If he had meant to harm me,
he would have killed Kalman.

49:39.160 --> 49:40.115
Or he could have seen you

49:40.280 --> 49:42.316
enter the ward and didn't know
which of the two was your friend.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.754
A terminal patient

49:43.920 --> 49:45.035
on the point of death.

49:45.200 --> 49:47.475
A murder that wouldn't have been
discovered had it not been

49:47.680 --> 49:49.830
- for the note.
- Another imperceptible crime.

49:51.480 --> 49:55.393
And might I know what
you're talking about, gentlemen?

49:55.920 --> 49:59.754
The second sign gives the clue as to
how the sequence should be read.

49:59.920 --> 50:01.797
It could be
figurative representations,

50:01.960 --> 50:05.635
or could be semantic or syntactic,
like geometric figures.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.756
Can you translate that?

50:08.600 --> 50:09.919
The professor means the signs

50:10.080 --> 50:11.718
could represent things
in the real world

50:12.280 --> 50:15.590
or not represent anything,
be abstract, like geometric shapes.

50:16.120 --> 50:18.031
The second symbol
is again astute, because,

50:18.200 --> 50:20.156
being so schematic,
it allows both readings.

50:20.640 --> 50:24.189
It could be a game of symmetry,
or it could simply be a fish.

50:24.520 --> 50:25.555
Soup,

50:26.560 --> 50:27.629
fish,

50:28.920 --> 50:30.114
dessert.

50:30.960 --> 50:32.712
Martin, show some respect

50:33.080 --> 50:33.876
for the inspector, please.

50:34.040 --> 50:36.349
No possibility deserves
to be overlooked.

50:37.040 --> 50:38.598
Let me propose a puzzle.

50:38.960 --> 50:41.030
What is the fourth

50:41.200 --> 50:42.394
symbol...

50:43.480 --> 50:44.879
in this other series?

50:50.640 --> 50:51.789
No idea.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.632
Did you miss class that day, too?

50:54.320 --> 50:56.515
You just have to know how to look.
The solution

50:56.680 --> 50:57.715
is very simple, I assure you.

50:57.880 --> 50:59.518
It's called the idiot series.

51:00.080 --> 51:00.990
Anyone who can't work it out...

51:01.160 --> 51:02.673
Thank you, professor.
I get the message.

51:03.640 --> 51:07.110
However, I incline to the idea that
the symbols relate to mathematics,

51:07.320 --> 51:08.594
rather than gastronomy.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.836
So, you think
a mathematician's involved?

51:11.000 --> 51:14.629
It's possible, someone who seeks
recognition of some sort,

51:15.800 --> 51:17.756
or someone who's not
a mathematician but wants to be.

51:17.920 --> 51:18.909
A student?

51:19.080 --> 51:19.990
That's unlikely.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.275
Could you take

51:21.440 --> 51:23.112
the second lieutenant out, Martin?

51:23.480 --> 51:24.390
No, I haven't taught
for a long time.

51:24.560 --> 51:26.516
Well, can you tell us

51:26.680 --> 51:28.750
what the third symbol

51:28.920 --> 51:29.750
will be?

51:30.920 --> 51:31.909
No.

51:32.320 --> 51:34.117
Far too many options.

51:34.640 --> 51:38.155
He's putting us to the test,
and I wouldn't like to slip up.

51:38.360 --> 51:40.078
Okay, let's see
if I've got this right.

51:41.400 --> 51:44.073
We are going to wait
until he kills another person

51:44.240 --> 51:47.437
because we can't decipher
this bloody puzzle?

51:49.280 --> 51:50.872
Tricky situation, isn't it?

51:52.400 --> 51:54.868
- Could I get those there?
- 2.60 please, sir.

51:56.480 --> 51:57.629
Good evening.

52:17.480 --> 52:18.515
Seldom!

52:18.720 --> 52:19.709
Martin?

52:19.880 --> 52:21.359
Why are you following me?

52:21.520 --> 52:24.318
I'm not following anybody,
for God's sake, least of all you!

52:24.480 --> 52:25.833
So what are you doing here?

52:26.000 --> 52:27.274
I'm going to that restaurant.

52:27.440 --> 52:29.078
Do you find it so odd that
I should be going out for dinner?

52:29.240 --> 52:30.150
That's where I'm going, too.

52:31.160 --> 52:32.752
Why, that's absurd.

52:34.880 --> 52:35.949
I'm sorry.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.189
I should have told you
Arthur was coming as well.

52:38.440 --> 52:40.476
Excuse me, Lorna,
but I'm the one who's annoyed

52:40.680 --> 52:42.671
by the presence at our table
of this good-for-nothing.

52:42.840 --> 52:43.636
Good-for-nothing?

52:44.520 --> 52:47.398
You couldn't see a joke if it stood
up and bit you in the arse, Martin.

52:47.560 --> 52:48.470
You're far too serious

52:48.640 --> 52:51.279
- for your age.
- He called me at the hospital and I

52:51.440 --> 52:53.032
just thought it would be best to
bring you up to date together, so...

52:53.200 --> 52:57.239
Forget it, I'm not bothered by it.
I just hope I didn't hurt you.

52:57.400 --> 52:59.356
Even if you had,
I wouldn't admit it.

52:59.520 --> 53:00.999
You're like two kids
fighting over a ball.

53:01.160 --> 53:03.515
- And you're the ball?
- No, I'm the nurse who's gonna spank

53:03.720 --> 53:04.675
your bottoms
if you don't shut up.

53:04.840 --> 53:05.955
Please.

53:07.360 --> 53:09.351
I talked with the forensic expert.

53:09.520 --> 53:10.316
And?

53:10.480 --> 53:11.356
Nothing.

53:12.760 --> 53:14.830
Not a trace of
any toxic substance.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.797
Whatever he was injected with
is totally unknown.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.075
Air, maybe?

53:18.240 --> 53:19.389
No!

53:19.560 --> 53:20.675
Let her speak, please.

53:20.840 --> 53:24.628
He's right, it's unlikely.
If he'd been injected with air,

53:24.840 --> 53:26.876
they would have spotted it
in the post mortem.

53:27.640 --> 53:30.438
However there is another
possibility. A substance

53:30.600 --> 53:32.750
they extract from
a poisonous mushroom: Amanita

53:32.920 --> 53:35.718
Muscaria. But there are
no reagents that detect it.

53:35.920 --> 53:37.592
So it's a sort of secret among

53:37.800 --> 53:39.552
- forensic pathologists.
- How did you find out?

53:39.920 --> 53:42.434
Lorna has a knack
of finding out what she wants.

53:44.240 --> 53:45.753
Her house is littered
with murder mysteries,

53:45.920 --> 53:47.797
but I imagine
you know that by now.

53:47.960 --> 53:48.995
Yes, I do.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.430
What surprises me
is that you haven't managed

53:52.600 --> 53:54.431
to worm all the information
out of Martin.

53:55.920 --> 53:58.036
Martin is a good guy.
He knows he can't tell anyone

53:58.240 --> 53:59.559
what you or the police
have told him in confidence.

53:59.720 --> 54:01.517
Well, he does right
not to tell you anything.

54:01.680 --> 54:03.511
After all, you're still
on the list of suspects.

54:03.680 --> 54:04.430
Me?

54:04.600 --> 54:06.192
Well, don't look so surprised.

54:06.360 --> 54:08.112
Both murders are closely linked
with the hospital.

54:08.280 --> 54:10.191
You could have gone
into the room and injected

54:10.360 --> 54:11.429
that substance which, curiously,

54:11.600 --> 54:13.670
only you and the forensic
pathologists know about.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.876
That's ridiculous.
She has no motive.

54:16.160 --> 54:20.392
Of all the vast mountains of
knowledge you have not yet scaled,

54:20.560 --> 54:24.394
Martin, this slope is one
of the most slippery. Be careful.

54:25.440 --> 54:27.431
Don't even go there, Arthur.

54:30.280 --> 54:31.679
Let it suffice to say

54:32.520 --> 54:35.239
that our relationship
transcended the purely intellectual,

54:36.280 --> 54:36.951
and when it ended,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.070
she took it anything but sportingly.

54:40.240 --> 54:41.753
If you don't shut up
I'll kill you, I promise.

54:42.360 --> 54:43.429
There, you see?

54:44.840 --> 54:47.400
Has she or has she not got a motive?

54:47.840 --> 54:50.070
You are so obnoxious.

54:50.680 --> 54:52.750
You enjoy playing with people.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.033
Now do you understand?

55:00.520 --> 55:02.476
Any formulation
is valid in the series,

55:02.640 --> 55:05.518
because we can always find
a rule that justifies it.

55:06.120 --> 55:09.192
Heart on a line,
now you've got the eight...

55:11.800 --> 55:13.392
now you give me the fourth.

55:19.720 --> 55:22.314
Ah, well, well, young man.
You are certainly not a total idiot.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.197
One, two, three, four.

55:28.440 --> 55:30.271
- This was easy.
- The murderer's series

55:30.440 --> 55:32.317
is infinitely more complex.

55:34.480 --> 55:35.833
Tell me what the third symbol is.

55:36.560 --> 55:38.391
Circle, fish...

55:39.480 --> 55:40.674
What's the third?

55:41.960 --> 55:43.313
I'm sorry, I can't say.

55:44.400 --> 55:47.233
- Why not? Don't you trust me?
- I trust you

55:47.400 --> 55:48.549
implicitly but
that's not the point.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.478
If I tell you,
then you'll stop thinking.

55:51.120 --> 55:52.917
You might come up
with a better idea

55:53.080 --> 55:54.195
than mine.

55:54.360 --> 55:58.069
No, there's something else. You
could have easily told the police.

55:58.360 --> 56:00.078
For them, anything
is better than nothing.

56:00.680 --> 56:01.874
You're right.

56:03.440 --> 56:05.032
But there's a good reason
why I didn't.

56:05.200 --> 56:06.474
I'm scared.

56:06.640 --> 56:07.356
Scared?

56:07.640 --> 56:10.438
This whole business terrifies me.

56:10.600 --> 56:12.716
We're playing
with symbols and puzzles,

56:12.880 --> 56:14.279
but behind it all
is the real world,

56:14.440 --> 56:17.113
do you understand?
It's about people's lives.

56:17.360 --> 56:20.830
If we make a mistake in an equation,
we rub it out, no problem.

56:21.680 --> 56:23.352
But where life is concerned,

56:23.680 --> 56:25.033
there's no turning back.

56:25.960 --> 56:27.393
In the real world any decision,

56:27.560 --> 56:30.518
however insignificant,
has irreversible consequences.

56:30.680 --> 56:33.194
At least, that's
what life has taught me.

56:35.440 --> 56:36.793
You're very young.

56:38.880 --> 56:41.599
I've already paid
a high price for my mistakes.

56:55.720 --> 56:56.789
Keep this.

56:58.040 --> 56:58.995
What is it?

56:59.560 --> 57:01.073
It's the third symbol of the series.

57:01.320 --> 57:04.278
You can do one of two things: you
can open it now and have your answer

57:04.440 --> 57:06.715
or you can work out
the solution yourself,

57:06.880 --> 57:09.155
and prove you're not an idiot.

57:34.880 --> 57:36.029
Thank you very much.

57:36.200 --> 57:37.474
We're finished.

57:37.640 --> 57:38.470
Thanks.

57:41.880 --> 57:42.949
I'm glad to see you.

57:43.320 --> 57:44.673
That was spectacular.

57:44.880 --> 57:46.199
You should see it
with the fireworks

57:46.360 --> 57:47.713
- and everything...
- What, here?

57:47.880 --> 57:49.791
No. It's just a rehearsal
for the Guy Fawkes' day concert.

57:50.360 --> 57:51.475
Guy Fawkes?

57:51.640 --> 57:52.993
Remember, remember
the fifth of November?

57:53.160 --> 57:54.832
No, sorry, I don't remember.

57:55.120 --> 57:55.950
And...

57:56.120 --> 57:57.792
it'll be my last concert.

57:57.960 --> 57:59.234
I'm taking your advice
and getting out.

57:59.400 --> 58:01.277
This "marvellous" city
can be stifling.

58:01.440 --> 58:02.919
It's too dismal.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.957
I want to go somewhere
with more light.

58:05.680 --> 58:08.319
Spain or...
maybe South America.

58:08.480 --> 58:10.869
Beth, I want to apologize
for what happened.

58:12.120 --> 58:14.475
It was my fault.
I needed help,

58:14.640 --> 58:16.915
a little affection, you gave it
to me and I spoiled it all.

58:17.080 --> 58:19.435
You were going through
a difficult time, I understand.

58:20.720 --> 58:23.280
You're very sweet.
So, you coming to the concert?

58:23.480 --> 58:24.595
I'll be there.

58:33.240 --> 58:34.275
Martin!

58:35.760 --> 58:37.591
There's something else
I need to tell you.

58:38.360 --> 58:41.318
I spoke with Petersen and maybe
I said more than I should have.

58:41.480 --> 58:42.629
Why?

58:43.680 --> 58:46.433
He began to ask me
some questions about you.

58:46.680 --> 58:47.749
Me?

58:48.320 --> 58:49.355
He wanted to know

58:49.520 --> 58:51.238
why you chose
my house in particular.

58:51.520 --> 58:52.748
What did you tell him?

58:53.240 --> 58:54.116
The truth.

58:54.280 --> 58:56.396
That you're obsessed with everything
there is to do with Seldom.

58:56.560 --> 58:57.515
You told him what?

58:57.680 --> 58:59.033
I didn't think it was important.

58:59.360 --> 59:01.828
I'm sure you're not going to deny
that you're obsessed with him.

59:02.040 --> 59:03.109
What are you talking about?

59:04.760 --> 59:06.079
He also asked me...

59:07.360 --> 59:10.397
if... there was any relationship
between the two of us.

59:10.600 --> 59:12.591
- And you said...
- I told him what happened.

59:12.760 --> 59:14.159
What happened?
Nothing!

59:14.320 --> 59:16.356
Exactly, that's what
I told him, nothing happened.

59:17.560 --> 59:20.393
Okay, okay... You'd have been better
off not saying anything at all.

59:20.560 --> 59:22.073
I know, and...

59:22.480 --> 59:24.835
as soon as I said it
I regretted it but...

59:25.320 --> 59:26.548
I was angry
with you and it was

59:26.760 --> 59:27.875
the first thing
that came into my mind.

59:28.400 --> 59:29.879
What else did you tell him, Beth?

59:30.040 --> 59:31.951
I told him that I...

59:32.760 --> 59:35.672
I had a feeling that
you weren't interested in me

59:36.640 --> 59:38.312
and that you preferred
being with Seldom.

59:38.480 --> 59:39.595
Oh, bloody hell!

59:39.760 --> 59:40.909
I'm sorry.

59:43.640 --> 59:46.200
You don't think they'll take
something so stupid seriously?

59:46.360 --> 59:48.430
They take everything
seriously, Beth.

59:49.800 --> 59:51.870
Well, I don't think it's going
to put you on the spot.

59:52.080 --> 59:55.390
It's absurd that the police should
think that you're the murderer.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.195
Does the perfect crime exist?

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.558
For years, writers
have speculated on this idea

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.989
and murderers too.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.754
Some even managed to put
the idea into practice.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.309
Like the case
of Howard Green, in London.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.232
Green was a humble tailor,

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.718
well-considered socially.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.792
He kept a diary which
the police found in his own house.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.871
In the diary, he analyzed

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.109
in great detail

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.713
fourteen ways of murdering

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.509
his wife, for whom he professed
a deep and secret

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.795
hatred. Some of

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.473
the procedures were ridiculous,

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.915
others brutal, one or two

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.274
really brilliant.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.032
But what Green understood at once

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.270
was that the main danger
for the criminal

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.750
was not the possible investigation
of facts in the past

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.114
but the problems that

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.918
might arise in the future.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.710
Every alibi contains an element
of falsehood which with patience

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.359
can be discovered.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:53.513
His conclusion was that
the only perfect crime that exists

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.156
is not the one that remains
unsolved but the one

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.754
which is solved
with the wrong culprit.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.993
Does he kill her in the end?

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.750
No, she kills him.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.109
One night she found the diary.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.038
She ended up stabbing him with

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.189
the kitchen scissors.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.994
The jury, horrified
by the reading of the diary,

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.231
judge the murder to have been

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.436
in self-defence
and declare her innocent.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.429
Julia Green,

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.955
you have been found
not guilty, you are free to go.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.315
I don't understand.
How is it the perfect crime?

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.994
It was discovered recently

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.754
that the handwriting in the diaries
was not Howard Green's.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.194
So, who wrote them?

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.591
His wife's lover,
a forger of works of art.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.874
The murderer is 30/36 years old.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:44.271
Born into a lower middle class
family, in a small town or a suburb

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.509
of a big city.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.633
He's got the characteristics
of a precocious genius.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.519
And probably

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.159
some form of physical defect.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.312
He imagines that his talents

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.234
triumph and that he can destroy
those who humiliate him.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.879
Then his big chance arrives:

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.589
to leave his environment and put
his former world behind him.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.159
And it is here that something
unexpected happens: he is rejected.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.591
For some, probably
unfair reason, he is expelled

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.992
from the place that he considers
to be his by right.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.720
And he finds himself
faced with the prospect

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.950
of having to return to the world
that he thought he'd escaped.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.831
Goodness, sounds like
this woman knew him personally.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.560
That's crazy, she has no basis.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.836
In any case, we're not talking
about a psychopath,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.911
there are no elements of cruelty.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.953
In fact, we could say
that he is virtually innocent.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.238
Exactly. The psychologist
puts special emphasis on that.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.674
The murderer is seeking

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.478
vengeance and admiration.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.353
The murders are, in a sense,
a way of paying court to you.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.988
There's a mixture
of the desire for vengeance

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.390
and the much stronger desire
to belong

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.836
to your world. He wants you
to accept him, Seldom.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.270
He's trying to please you,

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.398
as if he was in the first stages
of falling in love.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.515
The psychologist

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.037
thinks the murderer is a repressed
homosexual who lives alone.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.556
Bad cut.
You should have that seen to.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.478
I don't know what the hell...

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.071
At least you didn't tip a pot of
boiling coffee over your trousers.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.231
I'm an expert
at that, believe me.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.474
If you want,
we can carry on later.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.548
Yes, that might be an idea.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.748
Don't you think
you're exaggerating a bit?

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.309
The police are open
to all sorts of hypotheses.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.710
Right now any formulation
can be valid for them.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.995
You sound like Seldom.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.993
He's right, for God's sakes.
I could be a suspect, too!

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.479
Yeah, like me.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.552
Yes, like you, like everyone.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.716
Don't let Seldom
get into your head, baby.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.914
Cuz once he's in there,
there's no way of getting him out.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.709
That's what happened to you, isn't
it? You're still in love with him.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.549
That's not funny.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.515
Sorry.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.760
It's as if Seldom was everywhere,
it's a nightmare.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.911
There's nothing I've done
that he hasn't done already,

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.229
and apparently much better

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.117
than me.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.599
What do you want me to do?
To tell you

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.318
I prefer you and you fuck
better than he did?

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.358
No. I want you to lie
and tell me I'm more intelligent.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.709
Go to hell.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.233
You know what pissed me off?

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.628
What pissed me off was knowing

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.472
that I wasn't the only one
at the table who'd fucked you.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.553
That was so long ago.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.271
When you were thirteen, right?
He calls you

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.032
and you go running
like a little lapdog,

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.316
and all so he can
give you another kick.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.071
Yeah, that's how I am.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.069
Exactly like you.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.156
Martin, I think
you'd better go now, really.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.358
And until all this is over,

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.559
I really don't want to know
anything about you or Seldom.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.556
You are a shit
like the rest of us.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.149
We are mediocre,

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.437
and all mediocre people can do is...

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.634
get drunk and forget.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.309
Leave me alone.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.153
To the mediocre of this world!

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.516
To vulgarity

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.789
and stupidity!

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.636
Cambridge has kicked us
in the arse again!

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.315
What?

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.310
What are you looking at?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.319
It's true, isn't it?

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.109
You should give up maths
and write children's stories

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.310
- instead!
- Calm down.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.392
- Let's get out of here.
- One day

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.393
the Mad Hatter will come
out of his closet and assfuck

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.516
- the lot of you!
- Okay, come on.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.994
What are you talking about?

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.116
What planet are you from,
bloody fool?

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.918
If you'd stopped
fucking everyone in sight

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.913
and paid a bit of attention,
you'd have realized.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.671
Henry Wilkins?
Who's Henry Wilkins?

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.155
He's Kennedy's assassin,
who do you think?

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.711
He's solved Bormat's Last Theorem?

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.880
At least that is the rumour.
He's giving

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.519
a demonstration
in the next three days,

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.591
in the theory of numbers
conference at Cambridge.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.632
He's solved
the most fucking difficult

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.030
mathematics problem
of the last 300 years.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.158
And you know who should be there,
giving this demonstration?

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.799
Me!
Yuri Ivanovich Podorov!

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.757
You have a demonstration
of Bormat's Last Theorem?

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.359
No, of course I don't!

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.791
But I would have it, if your friend
Seldom had not stolen it from me.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.188
Ah, so that's it...

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.113
It was me who deduced
that the Bormat conjecture

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.748
could not be solved without
Taniyama's formulation.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.190
For every modular form,
there is an elliptic curve,

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.555
and for every elliptic curve
there is a modular form.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.596
You're drunk.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.513
Yes, I'm drunk!
But eight years ago I was not!

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.238
I went to Seldom,

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.118
explained to him,
asked him to help me

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.271
get into the theory
of numbers group at Cambridge,

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.432
and, do you know what
he said about my idea?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.194
"It's absurd."

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.712
"It's absurd"!

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.717
And now, thanks to this
little bit of absurdity,

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.714
Henry Wilkins

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.272
will go down in history.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.558
Apparently, he's been working

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.870
on Bormat in secret

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.349
- for seven years.
- Why in secret?

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.319
What do you mean why?

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:11.119
Because they stole it from me!
It was my idea!

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.396
But I tell you something:
they don't know how to do it.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.869
There's a mistake in their approach.
They don't know how to do it.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.359
But it hasn't been proved yet.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.719
Don't contradict me.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.311
You're on their side, aren't you?

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.791
You are all against me!
You are trying to steal my ideas!

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.518
You won't read my mind!

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.716
Help me! I'm being robbed!
Help me!

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.199
They're trying to kill me!

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.590
If you don't shut up,
I fucking will kill you!

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.989
Easy, easy.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.309
Bastards!

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.480
Fucking English and
their damned good manners.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.954
When they fuck you,

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.037
they really fuck you.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.312
Welcome to the party.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.877
I gather nobody told you
about the dress code for this do?

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.434
Good old Guy Fawkes
was ahead of his time.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.078
He tried to blow up Parliament

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:42.430
with the king, the lords and
the whole bloody government inside.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.549
Since then, every November 6th,
we've had this civilized celebration

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.836
where we burn his image,

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.075
although nowadays
I'd be hard pushed to tell you

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.959
whether it's to commemorate
his failure or his brilliant idea.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.792
Talking of conspirators...

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.156
No, don't look now, be discreet.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.630
Sitting behind me,

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.950
a few rows back, is a tall black
gentleman. Do you remember him?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.035
Yes.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.595
He's been following me for 3 days
now. He's one of Petersen's men.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:14.908
Is Petersen here as well?

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:15.910
Sitting to our right,

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.638
just there,
with his daughter.

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:21.679
There's something
I need to speak to you about.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.676
It might be...

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:43.799
- Did you see him?
- Who?

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.676
Podorov.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.399
He had something under his cape.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.596
We're following a suspect
inside the palace.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.718
I want all available men
inside here, now.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.510
Podorov!

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.588
He's going up to the roof!

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.354
What are you doing here?
Who's with Seldom?

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.034
- I only want...
- Shut up

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.474
and stay on the ground.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.517
What the hell's this?

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.989
Martin, you traitor.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.676
"Bastards".

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.989
This guy's just a fucking

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.309
clown.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.074
Scott, what the hell are you
doing here? Get back on Seldom!

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.116
I'm on to it.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.639
Let me through, please.
I'm a doctor.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.230
You okay?

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.955
This man is dead.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.276
Seems the cause
of death was asphyxia.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.635
How could they have choked him,
up there, in front of everyone?

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.756
According to the doctor
who attended to him,

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.512
it was a spontaneous
respiratory arrest.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.193
I've just spoken to Beth.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.476
Apparently, the man's state
of health was somewhat delicate.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.632
He was operated on a few years ago
for pulmonary emphysema.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.030
By rights he should
have died some time ago.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.270
With that problem,
if your breathing is obstructed,

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.913
you'd be dead
in a matter of seconds.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.790
We have no evidence to indicate
that this was a murder.

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.234
Yes, we do.

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.073
The third symbol is a triangle!

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.150
Where did you find this?

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.915
It was found on the conductor's
music stand. The assassin

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.230
tore the words
"the third in the series"

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.515
from the program notes.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.636
The circle, the fish,

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.436
and the triangle.
Well, it makes sense.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.198
I've had enough of this.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.035
I want you to tell me right now
exactly what you know.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.474
Otherwise, I'm gonna have

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.153
to consider you
to be an accomplice, because

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.117
it's obvious that
you're withholding information.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.993
I only have a rudimentary idea
of what his reasoning might be.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.115
So what is it,

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.269
for Christ's sake?

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.710
Well, I think maybe this is

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:31.828
not the best time.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.234
I don't believe it.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.118
Fine, fine.
I'll get out here.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.031
- Do you mind, Martin?
- No, don't worry about me.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:38.996
I could use a walk.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.958
Just don't walk
too far, all right?

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.275
Bastards.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.832
In Cambridge preparations
are being made

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.554
to celebrate one of the crowning
moments in its history.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.272
If the rumours are true, thanks to
Professor Henry Wilkins, Bormat's

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.433
famous last theorem could cease to
be unsolvable in the next few hours.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.194
Hundreds of mathematicians
from all over the world

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.316
will meet today
in Cambridge to witness,

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.799
live, the public demonstration

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.598
that Professor Wilkins will give

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.558
in the university's
Number Theory Congress.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.073
For centuries mathematicians

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.470
have tried in vain
to answer that theorem.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.517
Will the mystery be resolved?

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.109
I'm sorry about yesterday,
but I still think that you should...

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.669
Yeah, that I should think
for myself.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.396
Though I haven't been
too successful so far.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.910
Tomorrow the paper will publish
an article about the murders.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.593
In it I explain everything I know.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.315
Everything?

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.430
The police think that
if we make it public

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.353
and we give our solution to the 4th
symbol, it'll stop the murderer.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.398
What interests him is that

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.835
I recognize his intelligence.
That should be enough.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.674
Do you think it will work?

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.991
It's the best
I could come up with.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.154
So I have 12 hours
to prove I'm not an idiot.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.833
That just about sums it up, right?

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.074
You're not an idiot,
much as you might try.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.830
You know it, Martin,
you just have to remember.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.718
After all, you belong to the sect.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.914
- I know what you're thinking.
- So?

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.196
It could be the biggest mistake
of your life, believe me.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.429
I don't believe you.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.635
I think you're lying.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.394
You're right.
I am lying,

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:30.832
but if I distract you long enough,
maybe the bus'll set off and it'll

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.115
be too late.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.796
You know, these are a bit
hard to swallow at first,

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.838
but after a while
you get a taste for them.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.991
My spaghetti
or my mystery novels?

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.798
No, spaghetti
is a great invention.

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.678
So are mystery novels.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.068
You know, they make sense.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.519
There's something to find out and
they explain it to you at the end.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.238
In life, nobody
bothers explaining anything.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.278
I don't want to speak
of explanations,

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.317
or conjectures, or anything else.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.074
Outside this room nothing exists.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.995
Only you, me

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.348
and this spaghetti.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.510
I know what it meant
for you to get off that bus.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.878
It was worth it.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.673
It's only just begun.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.157
Look what you've done.
You're mad.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.475
Mad about you.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.878
You've got some there.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.353
This moment is perfect...

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.275
unique.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.109
"The unshaken heart
of well-rounded truth".

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.870
Come again?

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:27.636
It's from Parmenides,
he was a Greek stand-up comedian.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.354
He said that reality
is one big lie,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.274
and the only thing that exists

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.749
is a single unchanging God.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.712
Wow, you're doing it again.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:38.756
What?

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.433
Talking like
the people from your sect.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.989
- Well, I guess we can't help it.
- I guess.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.514
Now I understand

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.195
why girls go out with musicians
and not mathematicians.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.509
That's what he said.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.399
Really? He knew
girls prefer musicians?

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.472
No, no, no, no.
The thing about the sect.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.671
"You should know.
You're part of the sect."

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.958
- What?
- Fuck.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.158
No, no, no.
It can't be, it's too easy.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.150
What's wrong?

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.556
I have to discover it before
it comes out in the papers.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.789
What?

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:09.556
Oh my God, it's Seldom.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.278
You just have to go along
with his bloody game, don't you?

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.271
Yes, I do! It's all
I can fucking think about.

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.158
- Beth was right.
- What?

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:17.231
You're in love with
a bloody lunatic. That old man

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.391
- turns you on more than I do!
- Look, Lorna, listen to me.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.516
Just this once, that's all I ask.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.597
When this nightmare's over,
we're getting out

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.512
- of here.
- Where to?

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.990
Wherever. Outside these walls,
to a place with no books,

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.639
where people don't know
their two times tables.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.356
- Shit!
- I told you.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.356
It's too early,
even for the bookworms.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.348
What now?

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.074
Bookstore!

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.596
- Hey, we're closed.
- We'll just be a moment!

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.798
At least tell me
what we're looking for.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:03.999
Ah, here it is.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.279
The sect of the Pythagoreans...

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.714
The fathers of mathematics.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.791
They were forbidden
to reveal their secrets.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.434
They functioned like
a religious sect, numbers

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.397
were sacred to them,
gods that conformed the world.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.908
No, it's not here.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.639
I'm sorry but you'll have
to come back later.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:21.630
There's no one on the cash register.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.518
Don't worry.
We don't need to buy anything.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.908
Well, I think
you'd better leave, then.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.759
Oh, give us a moment.
Pretty please? Please.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.314
If you consult our catalogue,

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.038
I think you'll find everything
to meet your requirements.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.196
Will you shut up for a minute!
I can't think!

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.437
I'm sorry,

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.591
but you give me no option
but to call security.

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:38.988
Fine, call security.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.076
Just leave.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.516
It's got to be mentioned
in one of these,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.228
a diagram, or something.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.515
Kind of like that?

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.519
That's it. Perfect.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:58.870
One,

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.952
the beginning of all things.
Perfection, enclosed in itself.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:02.757
The fish.

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:05.713
That's what we thought. The Vesica
Piscis, a Christian symbol, but

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:06.630
this one's much earlier.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.316
It's simply two, the intersection
of two circles. Symbol of opposites,

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.835
duality, the war
between good and evil.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.115
Three, the triad,

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.669
the synthesis of opposites.
Peace after war.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.275
And the fourth symbol?

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.598
The Tetraktys, the quaternary.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:25.672
One plus two, plus three,
plus four: ten.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.399
Totality, the Demiurge.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.950
It was their divine number.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.029
One, two, three, four.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.634
That simple.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.513
How could I not see it?

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.310
Any enigma is easy
once you know the answer.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.795
What are you looking for?

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.839
The only thing I know about these
guys is that they had a unique...

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:52.152
understanding of medicine.
You know, if...

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.391
intelligence was
the supreme value,

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.155
then the mentally retarded
were the greatest sinners.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.515
They used them as guinea pigs

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.795
for medical experiments.

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.270
They even tried organ transplants...

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.354
Oh shit.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.074
Thanks very much,
that's all I need!

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.599
- Thank you.
- Really sorry.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.795
Come on!

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:56.711
Hey!

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:57.911
Come here!

01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.675
Come back here!

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:00.996
You two!

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:03.116
Where do you think
you're going? Come here!

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.715
I know who the murderer is.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:08.269
It's okay, John.
Really?

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:09.959
Look, I know I fucked up
in the concert,

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.109
but now you have to believe me.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.840
This time it could be worse, he
could kill more people, probably 10.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:14.830
Relax.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.794
This time he got in touch with us
directly. We guessed the symbol.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.351
The tetraktys...

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.909
Exactly. The message
indicates a particular place.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.229
He told us to send ambulances there.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.037
A road?

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.316
The A421. Just past
the Black Cat roundabout.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.913
That's the road to Cambridge.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.029
There's a flyover
on the main road.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.872
Petersen's already on his way.

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.156
He'll try to stop the bus
before it reaches that spot.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.799
Have you located the bus yet?

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.552
It's three miles from where

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.233
you are, sir.
You'll be meeting up

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.469
in under a minute.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.594
Petersen here, to all units.

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.830
The murderer may be travelling

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.037
with them, so keep your heads
down until I give the word.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.992
Where are they?
I can't see them.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.478
- Right in front of you, sir.
- Got it!

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:25.230
Now!

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.150
Now!

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.915
Jesus!

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.794
Turn off the engine!
Put your hands on the wheel!

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.310
We made it in time.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.274
They've stopped the bus.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.953
Seldom and the other
mathematicians are safe.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.237
Seldom? What have you done?
You've got the wrong bus!

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:29.790
Hello?

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.872
Seldom, you have to speak with
Petersen, there's another bus!

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.075
What are you talking about?

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.514
It's the girl's father!

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.829
What girl?

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.109
Martin?

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.114
Martin, can you hear me?

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.033
The girl in the hospital,
she needs a transplant.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.509
He wants to kill
the kids to save her!

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.115
Sir?

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.919
Excuse me, sir.
Sir, this way, please.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.391
- That bus has to be stopped!
- Calm down, sir.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.073
They're going to be killed!
I have to talk to Petersen!

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:20.119
Sir, one of the professors
insists on speaking to you.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.679
He's completely
lost control of himself.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.278
Oh what the hell?

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:57.677
You.
Did you know about this?

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.668
Did you fucking know about this?

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.353
You and your fucking equations!

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.033
I don't know anything.

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.875
Nothing.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:12.672
Five of the victims
are possible donors.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:16.075
Five organs offer a fair chance.

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.748
They're rushing them off
to St Joseph's.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.639
That's why he sent the ambulances.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.233
That's right.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.118
The petrol tank
was down to a minimum.

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.799
He wanted to cause
as little harm as possible,

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.758
only this time
it wasn't exactly imperceptible.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.438
Why all these?
Why all the symbols?

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.910
He didn't plan
to die in the accident.

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.992
His idea was to jump in time
to avoid being a suspect.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:37.876
How do you know?

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.153
When the bus crashed,
the doors were already open.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.873
And what about the other deaths?

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.317
Well, if only the children
had been killed,

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.038
he would have been
the prime suspect.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.918
Making us believe
in a serial killer

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.433
took the spotlight off him.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.478
Only he miscalculated
and didn't get out in time.

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.788
So, he didn't really want
to kill the other people,

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:01.799
- he just needed an alibi?
- Exactly.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.108
Shame we didn't work it out sooner.

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:06.469
So much

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:07.709
for logic.

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.435
You were just a pawn in his game.

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.756
You have nothing
to feel guilty about.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.229
You don't know what you're saying.

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.197
You don't need to get on a plane.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:35.235
Sorry?

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.676
I said, you don't need to get on
a plane. You're already miles away.

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.349
I was just thinking...

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.430
Really?

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:47.552
Ok.
From now on,

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.392
we are just two tourists

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:52.711
in an airport with the heaviest
rucksack I've ever seen.

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.633
What did you pack in here anyway?

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.513
Oh, you know, just the essentials.
A double bed, a cooker,

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.033
for making spaghetti

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.792
- and a couple of other things.
- Well, I hope

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.552
you didn't pack a single
one of your mystery novels.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:04.391
Of course not!

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.313
No mystery novels,
no symbols, no Oxford.

01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:09.118
We had a deal, remember?

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.833
You gonna be able to live like this?

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:12.909
Yes.

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.115
Just you and me.

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.430
Come on.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:29.989
Thank you.

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.318
Can I have your
boarding pass, please?

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.709
He didn't know!

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:42.916
Martin?

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.269
That old fucker tricked me!

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:47.915
He didn't know
what the third symbol was!

01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.189
My God!

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.432
You've got the pictures with you?

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.119
What is this?

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:05.316
"Kreis".

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:09.999
What is that?

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.078
She spent 3 years
deciphering German codes.

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:23.150
Excuse me, sir,
you can't do that here.

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:24.275
Of course!

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:26.590
Kreis is German for circle.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.433
He came up with it on the spot!

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.479
Have you been here before?

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.953
I never had a chance.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.991
It would be a pity to leave the
country without seeing this place.

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:18.875
This is the largest

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.190
collection of fakes in the world.

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.078
Not even Michelangelo

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.470
can distinguish
this David from his original.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.151
Trajan's column
we believe to be in Rome,

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.432
but we are sure
that this is a common

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:37.596
plaster copy.

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.238
I feel at ease here.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.876
No one tries to deceive me.

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.277
In effect, Martin,
this is the place

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.318
that contains the most truth
in the entire planet.

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.517
We have an absolute truth:

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.870
everything is fake.

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.832
Outside of these walls

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.956
nobody is sure of anything.

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:07.156
You took a big risk in giving me
a blank piece of paper.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.837
That was important.
I had to convince you that I knew

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.798
what the sign was when, at
that moment, I wasn't at all sure.

01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:19.276
I knew you wouldn't
let me down, Martin.

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.874
Your pride wouldn't let you open
this piece of paper

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.268
until you had
a solution of your own,

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.115
and that, if I might say,
was going to take some time.

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.478
There was no serial killer.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.799
It was an invention,
just like Petersen said.

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.430
But it wasn't
the bus driver's invention.

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:36.749
It was yours.

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.517
You invented a series of killings
to hide the only real crime:

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.753
the death of Mrs. Eagleton.
Beth killed her,

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:46.195
just as the police had suspected
from the very beginning.

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:53.436
Beth hated her life.
She couldn't put up

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.397
with that woman any more
so she killed her.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.471
That's when she sent you a note

01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.119
asking for help.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:01.277
I couldn't look her in the face.

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.950
It was my fault that her father
was killed in that accident

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.156
30 years ago.

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.758
I couldn't let her down again.

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.558
We both met at the door.

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.359
You'd come to get rid
of the evidence,

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.239
but I was there, in the way,
and that spoiled everything.

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:19.192
You had to come up with
a new plan, in front of me,

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.397
just moments before the police
arrived. You read the word

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.118
"circle" in German
on the Scrabble rack,

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.269
and that gave you the idea.

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.199
A series with
infinite possibilities.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:29.998
But you needed a second death

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:32.435
to convince the police
that the murderer was not Beth.

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.397
And unwittingly, I helped you.

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:39.477
I gave you the idea of how
to do it, without even realising.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:40.994
An imperceptible murder.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.554
A murderer who only kills

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:43.630
someone who is at

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:44.989
death's door. You only had

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.515
to wait for the occasion
and prick the body with a syringe.

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.554
That's when you sent
the second message. The fish.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.709
You still didn't know
where all this was going to lead.

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.792
The possibilities of continuing
the series were still infinite.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.030
You had to wait for
another occasion to arise.

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:01.191
And that could take weeks, months.

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.554
There was no hurry.

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.394
You probably had a different plan
for the third death,

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.592
but that triangle player suddenly
appeared like a gift from the gods,

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.353
- and you had your solution.
- At first I rejected it.

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:13.714
Too many people, too operatic.

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:15.591
Don't lie.

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:16.670
You couldn't waste

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.029
a chance like that.

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.591
What's more, there was a triangle.
It all took on meaning!

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:25.193
Beautiful... It was as if
the damned Pythagoreans

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.793
were on your side.

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.679
It was perfect,
but what's more important,

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.558
it was totally inoffensive.

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.598
Until the madman appeared.

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:37.591
Any one of our acts can have
unexpected consequences.

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:38.875
That's what you most feared.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:41.348
Who was to know that poor devil

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.511
was going to read
the article in the paper?

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:46.353
He was looking for a solution
to his daughter's problem,

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:49.319
while every day he drove to school
those healthy children

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:51.675
with perfect lungs
but damaged brains.

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.236
Why did they deserve to live
and not his daughter?

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.508
Mathematicians are not the only ones
familiar with the Greeks, professor.

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.792
You gave him his solution
when you published the series.

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:04.076
He also wanted to hide his crime.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.555
He only had to make
a phone call, and he did.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.149
So...

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.239
you think I'm the killer.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.195
No.

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.118
You haven't killed anyone,

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.235
but you're guilty of provoking the
deaths of those innocent children.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.717
You're guilty of arrogance,

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.673
of using us all like
pieces on a board game.

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.551
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:45.228
I hope my failure has, at least,
served to teach you something.

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.872
Yes, one thing.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.591
One very painful thing.

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.277
Numbers also lie.

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.598
The truth is not mathematical,
as I once believed.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.434
It's absurd, confused, random,

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.989
disorderly, and deeply unpleasant.

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:07.236
I'm glad that finally we can agree
on something, Martin, my friend.

01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:10.270
Just one thing has escaped you.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.278
The real culprit.

01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:20.758
The one who triggered off
this whole string of crimes.

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:22.239
Who?

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.515
You, Martin.

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.829
Don't make me laugh.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.275
If you don't believe me,
then speak to Beth.

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.678
She was in love with you,

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.078
or weren't you aware of that?

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:36.994
She remembered
your words exactly.

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.192
"You should try it."

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.911
"You should try it,"
pounded time and again

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.957
inside her head, like a hammer.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.195
"You should be free, like me."

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.397
That's what she understood,

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.318
and that's what she did.

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.513
Put an end to what
prevented her from being free...

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:05.512
her own mother.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.829
The butterfly

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.708
that flutters its wings
and causes a hurricane

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.757
on the other side of the world.

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.832
Sound familiar?

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.007
Are you that butterfly, Martin?

01:40:23.608 --> 01:40:24.608
