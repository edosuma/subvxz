00:55.639 --> 00:57.357
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

00:57.516 --> 01:00.895
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

01:01.061 --> 01:02.813
Well, sometimes
you have to get captured

01:02.938 --> 01:04.565
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.158
It's a long story,

01:07.234 --> 01:09.202
but basically,
I'm a bit of a hero.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.952
See, I spent some time
on Earth...

01:13.407 --> 01:14.579
fought some robots,

01:14.658 --> 01:16.285
saved the planet
a couple of times.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.329
Then I went searching
through the cosmos

01:18.537 --> 01:21.461
for some magic, colorful
Infinity Stone things.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.759
Didn't find any.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.135
That's when I came across

01:26.211 --> 01:28.964
a path of death
and destruction...

01:29.089 --> 01:31.842
which led me all the way here
into this cage...

01:33.468 --> 01:34.811
where I met you.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.059
Hmm.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.649
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?

01:56.700 --> 02:00.295
Thor, son of Odin.

02:00.912 --> 02:04.212
Surtur, son of a bitch.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.292
You're still alive.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.805
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.590
I cannot die.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.509
Not until
I fulfill my destiny...

02:13.675 --> 02:15.928
and lay waste to your home.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.596
It's funny
you should mention that.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.061
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.476
Asgard up in flames,
falling to ruins.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.860
And you, Surtur,

02:23.935 --> 02:25.437
are at the center
of all of them.

02:25.729 --> 02:29.450
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.451
-The great prophecy...
-Hang on.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.325
Hang on.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.123
I'll be back around shortly.

02:37.407 --> 02:40.251
I really feel like we were
connecting there.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.381
Okay, so Ragnarok.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.129
Tell me about that.
Walk me through it.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.293
My time has come.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.589
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame...

02:51.755 --> 02:54.429
I shall be restored
to my full might.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.844
I will tower
over the mountains...

02:57.010 --> 02:59.604
and bury my sword
deep in Asgard's...

02:59.846 --> 03:02.315
Oh, hang on.
Give it a second.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.771
I swear I'm not even moving.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.397
It's just doing this
on its own.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.988
I'm really sorry.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.857
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.653
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame...

03:13.819 --> 03:16.197
and then you'll suddenly grow
as big as a house?

03:16.363 --> 03:17.535
A mountain!

03:17.698 --> 03:20.747
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

03:20.909 --> 03:23.332
Odin is not on Asgard.

03:23.620 --> 03:27.545
And your absence has left
the throne defenseless.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.551
Okay, so where is it?
This crown?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.634
This is my crown,
the source of my power.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.632
Oh, that's a crown.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.513
I thought it was
a big eyebrow.

03:36.675 --> 03:37.847
It's a crown.

03:38.009 --> 03:41.513
Anyway, it sounds like all I
have to do to stop Ragnarok...

03:41.680 --> 03:43.398
is rip that thing
off your head.

03:43.682 --> 03:47.277
But Ragnarok
has already begun.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.234
You cannot stop it.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.042
I am Asgard's doom,
and so are you.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.795
All will suffer,
all will burn.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.672
Oh, that's intense.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.674
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big...

04:09.833 --> 04:12.336
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.172
But it looks like I'm gonna
have to choose option B...

04:15.338 --> 04:17.089
where I bust
out of these chains...

04:17.257 --> 04:19.009
knock that tiara
off your head,

04:19.091 --> 04:21.094
and stash it away
in Asgard's vault.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.273
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.523
Why fight it?

04:25.891 --> 04:29.361
Because that's what heroes do.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.357
Hmm.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.364
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.990
Hmm?

04:38.195 --> 04:39.538
And, now!

04:44.159 --> 04:47.709
You have made
a grave mistake, Odinson.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.419
I make grave mistakes
all the time.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.128
Everything seems to work out.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.234
Huh?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.501
Heimdall, I know
it's been a while,

06:15.584 --> 06:17.586
but I could really use
a fast exit.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.509
Heimdall?

06:21.506 --> 06:23.383
Heimdall was an idiot.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.518
This job should have
made him rich.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.930
Now, the job ain't easy...

06:28.096 --> 06:29.894
but it does have its benefits.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.434
The Bifrost gives me
access to everything

06:32.517 --> 06:34.440
the Nine Realms has to offer.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.901
I mean it's all mine
for the taking.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.567
Behold...

06:41.735 --> 06:42.907
my stuff.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.237
Ooh.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.914
I'm particularly fond
of these.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.623
I pulled them out of a place
on Midgard called Texas.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.834
I even named them.
Des and Troy.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.043
You see,
when you put them together...

06:58.043 --> 06:59.090
they destroy.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.107
Heimdall, come on.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.465
Stay!

07:43.213 --> 07:46.092
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.852
<i>- Heimdall?</i>

07:48.927 --> 07:50.349
Um... Skurge?

07:53.765 --> 07:55.108
ls that important?

08:02.107 --> 08:03.905
You girls
are in for a treat.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.417
Girls!

08:59.956 --> 09:03.677
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.883
Thanks for scaring away
my company

09:05.962 --> 09:07.635
and drenching my workplace
in brains.

09:07.922 --> 09:08.923
Who are you?

09:09.007 --> 09:10.759
Don't you remember?
I'm Skurge.

09:10.842 --> 09:11.968
We fought together
on Vanaheim.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.471
Right. Where is Heimdall?

09:15.096 --> 09:17.645
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.434
Traitor?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.103
Yeah. Well, you see,
Odin charged Heimdall

09:21.186 --> 09:22.187
with negligence of duty...

09:22.479 --> 09:24.277
but he disappeared
before the trial.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.565
Hard to catch a guy

09:25.648 --> 09:26.649
who can see
everything in the universe.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.734
Sure.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.362
Hold on. I'm supposed
to announce your arrival.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.145
What the hell is that?

10:04.104 --> 10:06.823
Oh, brother.
This is it.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.359
I take my leave.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.236
You fool,
you didn't listen!

10:11.528 --> 10:12.529
I'm sorry.

10:12.737 --> 10:13.738
Lady Sif, get help!

10:13.822 --> 10:14.823
Somebody, help!

10:15.865 --> 10:17.162
Sorry
for all I've done.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.081
Shh. It's all right. Hold on.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.664
I'm sorry
I tried to rule Earth.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.173
They'd be lucky to have you.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.176
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.129
-I just couldn't help myself.
-I know.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.512
I'm a trickster.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.515
So mischievous.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.393
Sorry about that time
I turned you into a frog.

10:35.677 --> 10:36.974
It was a wonderful joke.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.268
'Twas indeed hilarious.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.524
You are the savior
of Asgard.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.856
-Tell my story.
-I will.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.061
Build a statue for me.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.946
We will build
a big statue for you.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.983
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.119
I will tell Father
what you did here today.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.950
I didn't do it for him.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.788
I didn't do it for him.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.715
No!

11:13.423 --> 11:16.142
And so,
Loki died of his wounds...

11:16.426 --> 11:18.224
giving his life for ours.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.060
He fought back
those disgusting elves...

11:21.347 --> 11:23.020
he brought peace to the realm.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.481
Loki, my boy...

11:26.269 --> 11:27.942
‘tvvas many moons ago
I found you

11:28.021 --> 11:29.989
on that
frostbitten battlefield.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.238
On that day,
I did not yet see in you...

11:33.526 --> 11:35.699
Asgard's savior. No.

11:35.987 --> 11:40.367
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle...

11:41.284 --> 11:44.379
that melted
this old fool's heart.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.342
Bravo! Bravo!
Well done. Bravo.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.089
Father.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.175
Oh, shit.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.802
Uh, my son, Thor,
has returned!

12:00.178 --> 12:03.182
Greetings, my boy.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.936
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.193
<i>The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.</i>

12:07.268 --> 12:09.191
The people wanted
to commemorate him.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.696
Ah, indeed they should.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.156
I like the statue.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.488
A lot better looking than he
was when he was alive, though.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.494
A little less weaselly,
less greasy, maybe.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.622
Do you know what this is?

12:20.657 --> 12:23.501
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!

12:23.785 --> 12:25.207
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault...

12:25.495 --> 12:27.122
so it doesn't turn
into a giant monster

12:27.205 --> 12:28.582
and destroy the whole planet.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.881
Thank you, dear. Um...

12:31.960 --> 12:34.634
So it's back to Midgard
for you, is it?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.005
Nope.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.138
I've been having this
reoccurring dream lately.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.099
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.388
That's just
a silly dream...

12:43.680 --> 12:45.523
signs of an overactive
imagination.

12:45.807 --> 12:46.808
Possibly.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.734
But then I decide to go
out there and investigate.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.152
And what do I find,

12:50.228 --> 12:52.981
but the Nine Realms
completely in chaos.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.117
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise...

12:56.401 --> 12:57.823
all while you, Odin,

12:57.902 --> 12:59.199
the protector
of those Nine Realms...

12:59.487 --> 13:01.034
are sitting here
in your bathrobe,

13:01.114 --> 13:02.115
eating grapes.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.326
Yes, it is best to respect
our neighbors' freedom.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.583
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.545
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.

13:11.833 --> 13:12.834
Watching theater.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.760
Board meetings, and security
council meetings...

13:14.961 --> 13:16.053
You're really gonna
make me do it?

13:16.296 --> 13:17.468
DO what?

13:21.050 --> 13:23.178
You know that
nothing will stop Mjolnir

13:23.261 --> 13:24.763
as it returns to my hand.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.397
Not even your face.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.775
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.478
Then I'll see you
on the other side, brother.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.272
All right, I yield.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.575
Behold!

13:46.534 --> 13:47.626
<i>Thor...</i>

13:48.536 --> 13:49.753
-Odinson.
-No.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.799
You had one job. Just the one.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.961
Where's Odin?

13:57.253 --> 13:58.880
You just couldn't stay away,
could you?

13:58.963 --> 14:00.931
Everything was fine
without you.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.764
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.261
-Ask them.
-Where's Father?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.972
-Did you kill him?
-You had what you wanted.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.056
You had the independence
you asked for.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.265
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:09.349 --> 14:11.443
Okay. I know exactly
where he is.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.698
I swear I left him right here.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.459
Right here
on the sidewalk,

14:28.534 --> 14:29.831
or right there where the
building is being demolished?

14:30.161 --> 14:31.162
Great planning.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.584
How was I supposed to know?

14:32.705 --> 14:33.922
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.297
No? Then why do you dress
like one?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.677
-Hey.
-I can't believe you're alive.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.304
I saw you die.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.098
I mourned you,
I cried for you.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.470
I'm honored.

14:43.841 --> 14:44.842
Ask him.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.511
Hi. Would you mind taking
a picture with us?

14:46.761 --> 14:48.889
Oh, sure.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.518
Start figuring out
where he is.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.521
Oh, my God.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.692
Sorry to hear
that Jane dumped you.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.438
She didn't dump me, you know.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.777
I dumped her.
It was a mutual dumping.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.610
What's this?
What are you doing?

15:02.944 --> 15:03.945
This isn't me.

15:08.658 --> 15:09.659
Loki.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.607
Thor Odinson.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.698
God of Thunder.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.292
You can put down the umbrella.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.103
So, Earth has, uh,
wizards now?

16:11.429 --> 16:13.682
{CHUCKUNG)

16:17.226 --> 16:18.398
The preferred term is

16:18.478 --> 16:20.196
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.865
All right, wizard.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.237
Who are you?
Why should I care?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.573
My name
is Doctor Stephen Strange,

16:26.652 --> 16:28.620
and I have some questions
for you.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.697
Take a seat.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.828
Tea?

16:38.623 --> 16:39.624
I don't drink tea.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.042
What do you drink?

16:41.417 --> 16:42.509
Not tea.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.590
So, I keep a watch list

16:47.715 --> 16:49.467
of individuals and beings
from other realms...

16:49.800 --> 16:51.347
that may be a threat
to this world.

16:51.427 --> 16:55.022
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.684
He's a worthy inclusion. Hmm.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.107
Then why bring him here?

17:01.646 --> 17:02.943
We're looking for my father.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.451
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was...

17:06.943 --> 17:09.116
all parties concerned would
promptly return to Asgard?

17:09.487 --> 17:10.488
Prom PflY-

17:10.655 --> 17:11.872
Great! Then I'll help you.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.242
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.160
I have to tell you,
he was adamant

17:16.243 --> 17:17.244
that he not be disturbed.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.460
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.714
-Hmm.
-And you don't have a phone.

17:24.292 --> 17:25.795
No, I don't have a phone...

17:26.087 --> 17:27.714
but you could have sent
an electronic letter.

17:27.797 --> 17:28.889
It's called an email.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.633
-Yeah, do you have a computer?
-No. What for?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.885
-Uh-huh.
-Anyway,

17:32.969 --> 17:34.562
my father
is no longer in exile.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.392
So if you could
tell me where he is,

17:36.472 --> 17:37.473
I can take him home.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.517
Gladly. He's in Norway.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.695
I'm just seeing
whether this incantation

17:42.770 --> 17:45.774
requires any Asgardian
modifications.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.487
Nope.

17:48.526 --> 17:49.527
Oh, we don't need that.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.669
Will you stop doing that?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.873
I need just one strand
of your hair.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.124
Let me explain something.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.714
My hair is not to be
meddled with.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.723
We could have just walked.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.315
He's waiting for you.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.691
All right.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.227
Don't forget your umbrella.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.649
Oh, yes.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.445
Sorry.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.703
There we go.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.702
I suppose I'll need
my brother back.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.545
Oh, yeah. Right.

18:47.084 --> 18:50.088
I have been falling
for 30 minutes!

18:51.088 --> 18:52.260
You can handle him from here.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.008
Yes. Of course.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.430
Thank you very much
for your help.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.677
Good luck.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.729
Handle me? Who are you?

18:59.472 --> 19:00.473
Loki.

19:00.723 --> 19:01.895
You think you're
some kind of sorcerer?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.688
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

19:03.976 --> 19:04.977
Bye-bye.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.379
Father?

19:33.214 --> 19:35.683
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.519
Father, it's us.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.437
My sons.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.730
I've been waiting for you.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.528
I know. We've come
to take you home.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.491
Home, yes.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.451
Your mother, she calls me.

19:59.990 --> 20:00.991
Do you hear it?

20:03.119 --> 20:04.666
Loki, lift your magic.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.834
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.503
Frigga would have been proud.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.297
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.680
I know that we failed you.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.139
But we can make this right.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.107
I failed you.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.737
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.695
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.483
No.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.035
It has already begun.
She's coming.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.414
My life was all that
held her back.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.490
But my time has come.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.162
I cannot keep her away
any longer.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.126
Father, who are you
talking about?

20:49.039 --> 20:51.792
Goddess of Death. Hela.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.382
My firstborn.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.589
Your sister.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.344
Your what?

21:03.929 --> 21:06.648
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.982
I couldn't stop her,
so I imprisoned her.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.153
Locked her away.

21:13.397 --> 21:16.401
She draws her strength
from Asgard...

21:17.735 --> 21:21.239
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.

21:21.947 --> 21:22.994
Whatever she is,
we can stop her together.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.074
We can face her together.

21:24.325 --> 21:25.326
No, we won't.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.462
I'm on a different path now.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.085
This you must face alone.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.218
I love you, my sons.

21:37.046 --> 21:38.423
Look at that.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.182
Remember this place.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.056
Home.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.059
Brother.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.490
This was your doing.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.283
So he's gone.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.499
That's a shame. I would've
liked to have seen that.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.413
You must be Hela.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.329
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

23:33.746 --> 23:37.000
Really?
You don't look like him.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.168
Perhaps we can come
to an arrangement.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.212
You sound like him.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.298
Kneel.

23:44.715 --> 23:45.807
Beg your pardon?

23:50.220 --> 23:51.642
Kneel.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.735
Before your queen.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.397
I don't think so.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.117
It's not possible.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.835
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.143
Bring us back!

24:38.227 --> 24:39.228
No!

24:48.404 --> 24:49.405
Loki!

25:36.577 --> 25:37.954
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?

25:43.375 --> 25:44.422
I'm Hela.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.301
I'm just a janitor.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.889
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.644
How would you like a job?

28:09.146 --> 28:10.614
Are you a fighter?

28:11.523 --> 28:12.775
Or are you food?

28:13.567 --> 28:14.944
I'm just passing through.

28:15.652 --> 28:16.949
It is food.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.322
On your knees.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.408
He's mine.

29:11.792 --> 29:12.793
Wait!

29:21.843 --> 29:22.844
Wait!

29:25.180 --> 29:26.181
He's mine.

29:26.431 --> 29:29.526
So if you want him,
you go through me.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.145
But we've already got him.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.740
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.743
More food.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.438
Thank you.

30:49.806 --> 30:53.276
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.525
I've got something special.

30:55.812 --> 30:58.031
Hey! Where are you taking me?

30:59.566 --> 31:00.692
Answer me!

31:01.068 --> 31:02.160
Hey!

31:02.611 --> 31:04.989
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.250
Many apologies, your majesty.

31:36.978 --> 31:40.528
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

31:47.781 --> 31:51.206
I am Hela,
Odin's firstborn...

31:51.326 --> 31:53.579
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard...

31:53.870 --> 31:55.497
the rightful heir
to the throne,

31:55.580 --> 31:57.127
and the Goddess of Death.

32:01.795 --> 32:04.298
My father is dead.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.341
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.435
We were once the seat

32:08.510 --> 32:10.387
of absolute power
in the cosmos.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.768
Our supremacy
was unchallenged.

32:13.056 --> 32:16.026
Yet Odin stopped
at Nine Realms.

32:16.309 --> 32:19.609
Our destiny is to rule over
all others.

32:20.522 --> 32:23.571
And I am here
to restore that power.

32:25.235 --> 32:26.737
Kneel before me...

32:26.862 --> 32:30.787
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.124
Whoever you are...

32:34.327 --> 32:37.251
whatever you've done,
surrender now!

32:37.539 --> 32:39.633
Or we will show you no mercy.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.338
Whoever I am?

32:41.418 --> 32:44.012
Did you listen
to a word I said?

32:44.296 --> 32:46.173
This is your last warning!

32:48.425 --> 32:50.519
I thought you'd be happy
to see me.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.567
Fine.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.164
Charge!

34:06.336 --> 34:08.464
Oh, I've missed this.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.299
Still, it's a shame.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.268
Good soldiers dying
for nothing...

34:13.342 --> 34:15.516
all because
they couldn't see the future.

34:15.971 --> 34:17.223
Sad.

34:17.429 --> 34:20.434
Oh, look, still alive.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.701
Change of heart?

34:30.110 --> 34:32.362
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.121
You evil demoness!

34:39.159 --> 34:41.083
Let's go see my palace.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.280
Fear not, for you are found.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.332
<i>You are home,
and there is no going back.</i>

35:21.411 --> 35:23.755
<i>No one leaves this place.</i>

35:24.080 --> 35:25.627
<i>But what is this place?</i>

35:25.832 --> 35:28.927
<i>The answer is Sakaar.</i>

35:30.962 --> 35:33.056
<i>Surrounded
by cosmic gateways...</i>

35:33.256 --> 35:35.975
<i>Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.</i>

35:36.301 --> 35:37.928
<i>It is the collection point</i>

35:38.011 --> 35:39.684
<i>for all lost
and unloved things...</i>

35:40.013 --> 35:41.640
<i>like you.</i>

35:41.848 --> 35:44.476
<i>But here on Sakaar,
you are significant.</i>

35:44.809 --> 35:46.186
<i>You are valuable.</i>

35:46.269 --> 35:47.896
<i>Here you are loved.</i>

35:47.979 --> 35:48.980
What the hell?

35:49.105 --> 35:52.154
<i>And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.</i>

35:52.442 --> 35:54.410
<i>He is the original,</i>

35:54.486 --> 35:56.534
<i>the first lost
and the first found...</i>

35:56.738 --> 35:57.830
<i>the creator of Sakaar...</i>

35:58.156 --> 36:01.205
<i>and father
of the Contest of Champions.</i>

36:01.534 --> 36:05.664
<i>Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.</i>

36:05.997 --> 36:09.046
<i>You are the property
of the Grandmaster.</i>

36:09.417 --> 36:10.760
<i>Congratulations!</i>

36:11.002 --> 36:14.347
<i>You will meet the Grandmaster
in 5 seconds.</i>

36:14.798 --> 36:16.050
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

36:17.967 --> 36:19.093
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

36:20.804 --> 36:24.024
<i>You are now meeting
the Grandmaster.</i>

36:33.066 --> 36:34.363
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.198
He's wonderful.
It is a he?

36:39.531 --> 36:40.703
It is a he.

36:40.782 --> 36:41.783
Yeah.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.959
I love when you come
to visit, 142.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.621
You bring me the best stuff.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.710
Whenever we get
to talking, Topaz,

36:47.789 --> 36:49.507
about Scrapper 142...

36:49.708 --> 36:51.085
what do I always say?

36:51.167 --> 36:53.135
"She is the..."
And it starts with a

36:53.336 --> 36:54.337
Trash.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.098
No, not trash.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.517
Were you waiting
just to call her that?

36:59.592 --> 37:00.969
It doesn't start with a

37:01.261 --> 37:02.262
Booze hag.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.275
Uh, I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."

37:07.517 --> 37:08.643
'Cause I always say
you're the best.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.812
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

37:11.104 --> 37:12.822
You say that every time
she's here.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.065
What have you brought today?
Tell me.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.567
A contender.

37:15.775 --> 37:16.776
A what?

37:17.110 --> 37:18.987
I need to go closer.
I want a closer look at this.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.118
Can you take us closer?
Thank you.

37:33.710 --> 37:34.711
Pay this lady.

37:34.878 --> 37:36.505
Just wait a damn minute.

37:36.796 --> 37:39.049
I'm not for sale.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.015
Man, he's a fighter.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.475
I take 10 million.

37:48.767 --> 37:49.768
Tell her she's dreaming.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.819
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
transfer the units.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.411
You'll pay for this.

38:00.779 --> 38:01.996
No, I got paid for this.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.367
Here's what I wanna know.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.161
Who are you?

38:08.244 --> 38:12.215
I am the God of Thunder.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.709
Wow.

38:15.585 --> 38:16.802
I didn't hear any thunder,

38:16.878 --> 38:18.926
but out of your fingers,
was that sparkles?

38:19.631 --> 38:21.474
We've located your cousin.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.560
Uh,oh,good!

38:23.802 --> 38:25.804
Yeah, come on. I think
you're gonna like this.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.138
There he is.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.314
Hey, cuz.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.188
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

38:31.351 --> 38:32.648
Hi.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.153
Hmm.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.355
So...

38:35.647 --> 38:36.648
Please.

38:37.357 --> 38:38.859
I'm sorry.

38:39.108 --> 38:40.155
Yeah.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.486
Carlo...

38:42.779 --> 38:43.871
I pardon you.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.414
Oh, thank you.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.491
Thank you.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.661
You're officially pardoned.
From life.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.709
Help me.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.005
Oh, my God!

39:00.547 --> 39:02.390
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!

39:03.174 --> 39:04.346
Wow.

39:04.884 --> 39:06.306
Oh, the smell.

39:06.845 --> 39:07.937
What does it smell like?

39:08.221 --> 39:10.394
Burnt toast.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.191
What happened to my manners?

39:12.559 --> 39:13.981
lhaven1
properly introduced myself.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.067
Come on. Uh, follow me.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.489
My name is Grandmaster.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.488
I preside over
a little harlequinade

39:20.567 --> 39:21.989
called
the Contest of Champions.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.657
People come from far and wide

39:23.736 --> 39:24.908
to unwillingly
participate in it.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.322
And you, my friend,

39:26.406 --> 39:27.908
might just be part
of the new cast.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.121
What do you say to that?

39:29.200 --> 39:31.202
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

39:31.411 --> 39:32.663
I'm going back to Asgard.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.131
Ass-gard.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.917
One, two, three, four.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.680
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.009
At that moment,
I let go.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.259
Loki?

39:47.719 --> 39:49.312
Loki! Loki!

39:49.554 --> 39:52.808
Over here. over here.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.274
-Excuse me one second.
-Loki!

39:56.269 --> 39:57.441
-What?
-You're alive?

39:57.520 --> 39:59.193
-Yes, of course I'm alive.
-What are you doing here?

39:59.480 --> 40:00.481
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

40:00.565 --> 40:01.566
I'm stuck
in this stupid chair.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.946
-Where's your chair?
-I didn't get a chair.

40:03.318 --> 40:04.615
-Get me out of this one.
-I can't.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.037
-Get me out. What?
-I can't.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.113
I've made friends
with this man.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.197
He's called the Grandmaster.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.407
- Oh, he's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.167
The Bifrost brought me
out here weeks ago.

40:11.451 --> 40:12.452
-Weeks ago?
-Yes.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.661
I just got here.

40:13.912 --> 40:14.913
What are you
whispering about?

40:16.205 --> 40:17.832
Time works real different
around these parts.

40:18.124 --> 40:21.048
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

40:21.336 --> 40:22.838
But here on Sakaar...

40:28.384 --> 40:30.933
In any case,
you know this, uh...

40:31.012 --> 40:32.355
You call yourself
Lord of Thunder?

40:32.430 --> 40:34.808
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.688
I've never met this man
in my life.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.478
-He's my brother.
-Adopted.

40:38.561 --> 40:39.653
ls he any kind of a fighter?

40:40.021 --> 40:41.068
You take this thing

40:41.147 --> 40:42.148
out of my neck
and I'll show you.

40:42.398 --> 40:43.991
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.110
Hey, Sparkles,
here's the deal.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.496
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

40:48.738 --> 40:49.830
Asgard.

40:49.906 --> 40:52.750
Any contender who defeats
my champion...

40:52.951 --> 40:54.669
their freedom they shall win.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.500
Fine. Then point me
in the direction

40:56.579 --> 40:58.047
of whoever's ass
I have to kick!

40:58.373 --> 41:00.796
That's what I call, contender.

41:01.042 --> 41:03.340
Direction would be
this way, Lord.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.012
Ah! Loki!

41:10.760 --> 41:12.888
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.690
Over here.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.350
The pile of rocks
waving at you. Here.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.069
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.904
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.277
I'm kind of like
the leader in here.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.316
I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.868
But don't let that
intimidate you.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.323
You don't need to be afraid

41:28.403 --> 41:29.950
unless you're
made of scissors.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.326
Just a little
rock-paper-scissor

41:31.406 --> 41:32.407
joke for you.

41:32.699 --> 41:35.327
This is my very good friend
over here, Miek.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.246
He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.294
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

41:40.665 --> 41:43.134
-That I am.
-How'd you end up in here?

41:43.376 --> 41:45.094
Ah, well, I tried to start
a revolution,

41:45.169 --> 41:46.216
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.881
So hardly anyone turned up,

41:47.964 --> 41:50.558
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.180
As punishment, I was forced

41:52.260 --> 41:54.638
to be in here
and become a gladiator.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.143
Bit of a promotional disaster,
that one.

41:56.472 --> 41:59.066
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.351
I don't know
if you'd be interested

42:00.435 --> 42:01.482
in something like that.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.234
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

42:05.523 --> 42:06.524
How did you...

42:06.774 --> 42:09.368
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

42:09.652 --> 42:12.701
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.203
This doesn't make any sense.

42:14.282 --> 42:15.579
No, nothing makes sense
here, man.

42:15.825 --> 42:17.202
The only thing
that does make sense

42:17.285 --> 42:18.662
is that nothing makes sense.

42:18.995 --> 42:21.214
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

42:21.497 --> 42:22.498
Doug has.

42:22.665 --> 42:23.666
Doug!

42:23.916 --> 42:24.917
Our luck, Doug's dead.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.002
That's right.

42:26.169 --> 42:27.261
Everyone who fights

42:27.336 --> 42:28.428
the Grandmaster's champion
peﬂshes.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.427
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

42:30.673 --> 42:33.222
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.303
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

42:35.386 --> 42:37.229
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

42:37.513 --> 42:39.140
Wait. You're not gonna
face him, are you?

42:39.432 --> 42:40.729
Yes, I am.

42:41.059 --> 42:42.811
Gonna fight him, win,

42:42.894 --> 42:44.191
and get the hell out
of this place.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.689
That's exactly
what Doug used to say.

42:47.023 --> 42:48.741
See you later, new Doug.

42:58.659 --> 43:00.286
Does no one remember me?

43:01.079 --> 43:03.332
Has no one been taught
our history?

43:09.128 --> 43:10.471
Look at these lies.

43:11.297 --> 43:12.640
Goblets and garden parties?

43:15.009 --> 43:16.556
Peace treaties?

43:17.470 --> 43:18.596
Odin...

43:18.846 --> 43:20.348
proud to have it...

43:20.640 --> 43:21.892
ashamed of how he got it.

43:41.327 --> 43:43.455
We were unstoppable.

43:43.538 --> 43:45.461
I was his weapon
in the conquest

43:45.540 --> 43:48.009
that built Asgard's empire.

43:50.878 --> 43:54.178
One by one,
the realms became ours.

43:54.423 --> 43:58.519
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

43:58.803 --> 44:03.354
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

44:03.724 --> 44:06.398
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honored...

44:06.686 --> 44:10.190
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.123
-Odin's treasures.
-Fake.

44:25.413 --> 44:27.836
Most of the stuff in here
is fake.

44:28.541 --> 44:29.633
Or weak.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.713
Smaller than I thought
it would be.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.383
That's not bad.

44:36.465 --> 44:38.138
But this...

44:38.843 --> 44:40.845
The Eternal Flame.

45:09.290 --> 45:11.463
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

45:40.321 --> 45:42.915
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?

45:45.451 --> 45:49.456
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.

46:05.137 --> 46:06.935
I've missed you.

46:07.890 --> 46:09.688
I've missed you all.

46:12.520 --> 46:13.521
Odin...

46:13.813 --> 46:16.987
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla...

46:17.275 --> 46:19.528
where the brave
shall live forever.

46:21.070 --> 46:23.323
Nor shall we mourn
but rejoice...

46:23.698 --> 46:24.950
for those that have died...

46:25.032 --> 46:26.329
...the glorious death.

46:34.417 --> 46:35.714
Hurts, doesn't it?

46:36.002 --> 46:37.003
Being lied to.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.388
Being told you're one thing

46:39.463 --> 46:41.340
and then learning
it's all a fiction.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.181
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

46:48.472 --> 46:50.099
This place is disgusting.

46:53.102 --> 46:54.820
Does this mean
you don't want my help?

46:55.104 --> 46:57.027
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
position with the Grandmaster.

46:57.189 --> 46:58.566
It took me time
to win his trust.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.117
He's a lunatic,
but he can be amenable.

47:00.443 --> 47:01.660
What I'm telling you is,

47:01.736 --> 47:03.534
you could join me
at the Grandmaster's side.

47:03.779 --> 47:04.780
Perhaps, in time,

47:04.864 --> 47:08.334
an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...

47:14.373 --> 47:16.751
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

47:19.337 --> 47:21.931
Our sister destroyed
your hammer

47:22.006 --> 47:23.383
like a piece of glass.

47:24.467 --> 47:26.140
She's stronger than both of
us. She's stronger than you.

47:26.344 --> 47:27.641
You don't stand a chance.

47:27.803 --> 47:29.976
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

47:34.518 --> 47:35.519
Fine.

47:38.230 --> 47:40.699
I guess
I'll just have to go it alone.

47:41.609 --> 47:42.610
Like I've always done.

47:45.738 --> 47:46.910
Would you say something?

47:49.700 --> 47:51.122
Say something!

47:52.370 --> 47:54.464
What would you like me to say?

47:54.955 --> 47:57.049
You faked your own death...

47:57.333 --> 47:59.836
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power...

48:00.086 --> 48:01.554
stranded him on Earth to die,

48:01.629 --> 48:03.256
releasing
the Goddess of Death.

48:03.881 --> 48:05.053
Have I said enough or would
you like me to go back

48:05.132 --> 48:07.055
further than the past
two days?

48:08.761 --> 48:10.138
You know, I haven't seen this

48:10.221 --> 48:12.269
beloved champion
he talks of...

48:12.556 --> 48:14.433
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.

48:15.226 --> 48:17.820
I've placed a large wager
against you tomorrow.

48:19.188 --> 48:20.189
Don't let me down.

48:24.235 --> 48:25.657
Piss off, ghost!

48:28.239 --> 48:29.707
He's freaking gone.

48:38.124 --> 48:39.125
Oh, yuck!

48:39.250 --> 48:41.344
There's still someone's hair
and blood all over this.

48:41.627 --> 48:42.924
Guys, can you clean up
the weapons

48:43.003 --> 48:44.220
once you finish your fight?

48:44.380 --> 48:45.381
Disgusting slobs.

48:46.632 --> 48:48.054
Oh, Thor...

48:48.551 --> 48:50.349
wanna use a big wooden fork?

48:50.719 --> 48:51.720
No.

48:51.846 --> 48:53.018
Yeah, not really useful.

48:53.222 --> 48:54.940
Unless you're fighting off
three vampires

48:55.015 --> 48:56.608
that were huddled together.

48:57.601 --> 48:59.069
I really wish I had my hammer.

48:59.478 --> 49:00.479
Hammer?

49:00.688 --> 49:02.190
Quite unique.
It was made from this

49:02.273 --> 49:04.241
special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

49:04.817 --> 49:06.285
And when I spun it really,
really fast,

49:06.360 --> 49:07.862
it gave me the ability to fly.

49:07.987 --> 49:08.988
You rode a hammer?

49:09.238 --> 49:10.660
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

49:11.073 --> 49:12.325
The hammer rode you
on your back?

49:12.491 --> 49:14.084
No. I used to spin it
really fast,

49:14.160 --> 49:15.753
and it would pull me
off the...

49:15.828 --> 49:17.922
Oh, my God.
A hammer pulled you off?

49:17.997 --> 49:19.749
The ground. It would pull me
off the ground,

49:19.832 --> 49:21.630
up into the air,
and I would fly.

49:21.917 --> 49:22.918
Every time I threw it,

49:23.002 --> 49:24.800
it would always
come back to me.

49:25.171 --> 49:26.297
Sounds like you had
a pretty special

49:26.380 --> 49:27.757
and intimate relationship
with this hammer...

49:27.840 --> 49:28.966
and that losing it

49:29.049 --> 49:30.847
was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.063
That's a nice way
of putting it.

49:35.723 --> 49:36.975
I said they're mine.

49:38.517 --> 49:40.394
See her, that's the one
that put me in here.

49:40.728 --> 49:42.947
Oh, yeah. Scrapper 142.

49:43.022 --> 49:45.150
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.

49:45.232 --> 49:46.825
They are hard to perish.

49:47.026 --> 49:48.403
Asgardian?

49:50.237 --> 49:52.114
Hey. Hey.

49:52.865 --> 49:53.866
Hey-

49:54.241 --> 49:56.869
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

49:58.579 --> 49:59.956
Asgard is in danger.

50:04.460 --> 50:05.928
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.223
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger...

50:09.548 --> 50:11.846
until I found out that
you were all women.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.010
There's nothing wrong
with women, of course.

50:13.093 --> 50:14.094
I love women.

50:14.303 --> 50:15.725
Sometimes a little too much.

50:15.930 --> 50:16.977
Not in a creepy way,

50:17.056 --> 50:18.774
just more
of a respectful appreciation.

50:19.058 --> 50:20.310
I think it's great
that there is

50:20.392 --> 50:23.441
an elite force
of women warriors.

50:23.687 --> 50:25.109
It's about time.

50:26.607 --> 50:27.733
Are you done?

50:27.816 --> 50:28.817
Lord of Thunder,
you're up.

50:28.901 --> 50:29.993
Please, help me.
I need your help.

50:30.069 --> 50:31.070
Bye.

50:31.153 --> 50:33.326
Fine, then you must be
a traitor or a coward.

50:33.614 --> 50:35.867
Because the Valkyrie is sworn
to protect the throne.

50:36.492 --> 50:39.666
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.880
And I'm a Scrapper,
not a Valkyrie.

50:45.209 --> 50:47.086
Bring him in for processing.

50:47.461 --> 50:51.182
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

51:03.102 --> 51:04.570
Now, don't you move.

51:04.937 --> 51:07.440
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.

51:07.690 --> 51:10.489
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair...

51:10.818 --> 51:13.287
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.

51:17.658 --> 51:20.036
Please. Please, kind sir,
do not cut my hair.

51:21.370 --> 51:22.713
Please! No!

51:22.913 --> 51:23.960
No!

51:36.260 --> 51:39.013
<i>Wow! Look at
all of you.</i>

51:39.096 --> 51:40.769
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

51:41.015 --> 51:42.016
<i>Who's having fun?</i>

51:42.933 --> 51:44.810
<i>Please, I'm your host.</i>

51:45.060 --> 51:46.232
<i>Big round of applause</i>

51:46.312 --> 51:48.189
<i>for all of our
undercard competitors...</i>

51:48.439 --> 51:51.158
<i>who today died so gruesomely.</i>

51:51.400 --> 51:52.526
<i>Good sports.</i>

51:52.776 --> 51:54.369
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

51:55.070 --> 51:58.700
<i>This is what you've come for,
and so have I.</i>

52:04.747 --> 52:07.591
<i>And now,
without further</i> ado...

52:07.666 --> 52:10.169
<i>it's main event time.</i>

52:12.087 --> 52:13.555
<i>Making his first appearance,</i>

52:13.631 --> 52:15.178
<i>though he looks
quite promising...</i>

52:15.633 --> 52:17.306
<i>got a couple of tricks
up his sleeve.</i>

52:17.801 --> 52:20.350
<i>I'll say no more,
see what you think.</i>

52:20.846 --> 52:22.018
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...</i>

52:23.140 --> 52:25.313
<i>Lord of Thunder.</i>

52:48.624 --> 52:50.797
<i>Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.</i>

52:50.876 --> 52:52.219
<i>Okay, this is it.</i>

52:52.711 --> 52:55.635
<i>Let's get ready to welcome
this guy. Here he comes.</i>

53:04.765 --> 53:06.062
<i>He is a creature.</i>

53:06.266 --> 53:07.563
<i>What can we say about him?</i>

53:07.643 --> 53:10.112
<i>Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.</i>

53:10.354 --> 53:12.777
<i>l feel a special connection
with him.</i>

53:14.608 --> 53:15.780
<i>He's undefeated.</i>

53:17.236 --> 53:18.658
<i>He's the reigning.</i>

53:21.073 --> 53:23.121
<i>He's the defending.</i>

53:23.617 --> 53:24.618
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

53:25.035 --> 53:26.036
<i>I give you...</i>

53:26.370 --> 53:27.371
Uh-oh.

53:30.916 --> 53:34.591
<i>...your Incredible...</i>

53:38.424 --> 53:40.267
Hulk!

53:40.884 --> 53:42.227
Yes!

53:46.181 --> 53:48.024
I have to get off this planet.

53:48.767 --> 53:50.519
Hey, hey, hey.
Where you going?

53:58.902 --> 54:00.028
Hey!

54:00.738 --> 54:01.955
We know each other.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.283
He's a friend from work.

54:13.667 --> 54:15.214
Where have you been?

54:15.419 --> 54:17.421
Everybody thought
you were dead.

54:17.713 --> 54:19.511
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

54:20.132 --> 54:21.679
I lost my hammer.

54:21.842 --> 54:24.812
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.

54:25.345 --> 54:27.518
Loki. Loki's alive.
Can you believe it?

54:27.806 --> 54:28.853
He's up there.

54:29.057 --> 54:30.980
Loki! Look who it is!

54:33.228 --> 54:35.230
Banner, I never thought
I would say this...

54:35.314 --> 54:37.567
but I'm happy to see you.

54:37.900 --> 54:40.244
AUDIENCE;
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

54:46.033 --> 54:47.034
Banner.

54:48.160 --> 54:49.412
Hey,BanneH

54:49.995 --> 54:51.997
No Banner. Only Hulk.

54:52.498 --> 54:53.545
What are you doing?

54:53.624 --> 54:55.501
It's me. It's Thor!

55:16.021 --> 55:17.193
Banner, we're friends.

55:17.272 --> 55:19.240
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!

55:26.365 --> 55:28.208
Here we go.

55:47.052 --> 55:48.144
What?

55:58.689 --> 56:00.066
Hey, big 9W-

56:02.025 --> 56:03.902
The sun's getting real low.

56:15.205 --> 56:17.549
That's it.
The sun's going down.

56:20.669 --> 56:22.262
I won't hurt you anymore.

56:22.671 --> 56:23.923
No one will.

56:36.101 --> 56:38.103
Yes! That's how it feels!

56:39.688 --> 56:41.235
I'm just a huge fan
of the sport.

56:49.031 --> 56:51.375
All right. Screw it.

56:57.414 --> 56:58.540
Oh!

57:03.128 --> 57:04.220
I know
you're in there, Banner.

57:04.296 --> 57:05.297
I'll get you out!

57:14.681 --> 57:16.524
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

57:16.767 --> 57:17.893
I told them we were friends!

58:49.401 --> 58:52.245
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

58:54.031 --> 58:58.832
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

59:30.484 --> 59:33.112
Another day, another Doug.

59:42.370 --> 59:44.293
What is that noise?

59:44.539 --> 59:47.213
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.

59:47.709 --> 59:51.304
There's a resistance trying
to knock down the front gates.

59:56.843 --> 59:58.595
Tell me about yourself,
Skurge.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:01.315
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:03.479
Right, yeah,
I'll just stop you there.

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:05.310
What I meant was...

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:07.108
what's your ambition?

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:11.650
I just want a chance
to prove myself.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.401
Recognition.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:15.029
When I was young...

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.949
every great king
had an executioner.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.164
Not just to execute people...

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.920
but also
to execute their vision.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.712
But mainly to execute people.

01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:29.922
Still, it was a great honor.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:34.472
I was Odin's executioner.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:39.853
And you shall be
my executioner.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.352
Let's begin our conquest.

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.286
Skurge, where's the sword?

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:09.425
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.377
Those people you mentioned,

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.461
the ones who aren't
falling into line...

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:15.221
round them up.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:40.576
Excuse me.

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.089
Sorry about that.

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.466
These bloody things
are everywhere.

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:57.923
Come on.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:34.467
You'll be safe here.

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:44.946
Are we cool?

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.247
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.122
So how long
have you been like that?

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:54.835
Like what?

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:58.757
Like this. Big, and green,
and stupid.

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:02.051
Hulk always Hulk.

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:08.224
How'd you get here?

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:10.138
Winning.

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:11.814
You mean cheating, huh?

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:14.234
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:15.648
How'd you arrive here?

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:19.647
Quinjet.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.367
Yes. Now,
where is the Quinjet now?

01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:29.199
That's naked.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:32.077
He's very naked. Hmm.

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:36.877
It's in my brain now.

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:38.708
Quinjet.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:50.728
Yes!

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:52.348
I'm getting us out of here.

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.975
This is a terrible,
awful place.

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:58.855
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:00.397
Hulk stay.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:03.950
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:06.491
We must prevent Ragnarok.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:07.912
Ragnarok?

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:09.789
The prophesied death
of my home world.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:11.207
The end of days,
it's the end of...

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:15.586
If you help me
get back to Asgard...

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.838
I can help you
get back to Earth. Huh?

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:19.124
Earth hate Hulk.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:20.759
Earth loves Hulk.
They love you.

01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:22.343
You're one of the Avengers.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:23.636
One of the team,
one of our friends.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:26.097
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.473
You're Banner's friend.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.805
I'm not Banner's friend.
I prefer you.

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:31.136
Banner's friend.

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:32.220
I don't even like Banner.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.144
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:37.104
Thor go. Hulk stay.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:38.518
Fine.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:40.103
Stay here.

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:43.323
Stupid place.
It's hideous, by the way.

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:46.951
The red, the white.
Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:48.994
Smash you.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:51.452
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:53.741
-I smashed you.
-Yeah, sure, sure.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:55.660
-Baby arms.
-What?

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.124
Baby.

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:58.625
Moron! You big child.

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:00.005
<i>Thor gm!</i>

01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:01.833
I am going.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.214
Thor go again.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:13.265
Thor home.

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:24.864
Hulk trains.

01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:27.116
That's great. Have fun.

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.031
-Hey, big guy.
-Angry girl.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:30.324
What have you been up to?

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:31.654
Winning.

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:45.260
Heimdall, I know
you can see me.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.387
<i>I need you to help me.</i>

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.841
Help me see.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:04.696
I see you,
but you're far away.

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:06.819
What's going on here?

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.445
Come see for yourself.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:12.662
I'm providing refuge
in a stronghold

01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:13.738
built by our ancestors.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:17.493
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.707
You're talking
about evacuating Asgard?

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.795
We won't last long if we stay.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:26.801
She draws her power
from Asgard

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.002
and grows stronger every day.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:29.295
Come on.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:34.760
Hela is ravenous.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.052
If I let her leave,

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:37.933
she'll consume Nine Realms
and all the cosmos.

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:39.264
We need you.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:40.439
I'm working on it.
But I don't even know

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:41.516
where the hell I am.

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:44.106
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:46.192
-Which one?
-The big one.

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:16.430
Thor sad.

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:17.975
Shut up.

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:21.814
Thor sad.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:24.684
I'm not sad, you idiot.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:26.810
- I'm pissed off!
- Oh.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.448
Angry. I lost my father.

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:34.160
I lost my hammer.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:35.870
-You're not even listening.
-Whining and crying.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.117
Cry like baby.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:38.997
Don't kick stuff.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:42.456
You're being
a really bad friend.

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:43.745
You bad friend!

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.212
-You know what we call you?
-No.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:47.082
We call you
the stupid Avenger.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.300
You're tiny Avenger!

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:53.087
What, are you crazy?

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:54.296
Yes.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.841
You know what?
Earth does hate you.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.622
No. Mmm-mmm.

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:24.665
I'm sorry I said those things.

01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:26.787
You're not the stupid Avenger.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:28.919
Nobody calls you
the stupid Avenger.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:31.046
It's okay.

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:32.417
You just can't go around
throwing shields

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.627
at people.
Could have killed me.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:34.928
I know. I'm sorry.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.676
I just get so angry
all the time.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.804
Hulk always, always angry.

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:41.352
I know.
We're the same, you and I.

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:43.437
We're just
a couple of hot-headed fools.

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:47.484
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire,
Thor like water.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.194
We're kind of both like fire.

01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:52.354
But Hulk like real fire.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.776
Hulk like raging fire.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:58.153
Thor like smoldering fire.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.532
Hulk, I need you
to do something for me.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:03.700
Hmm?

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.582
Angry girl.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.175
What's going on?
What are you...

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:31.068
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell...

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:32.695
when someone's hiding
all the way across

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.067
the universe and wants
to be left alone.

01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:36.858
-We need to talk.
-No, you wanna talk to me.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:38.781
I need her to stay.

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:39.944
Stay?

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:41.571
Block.

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:44.995
Stay.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.667
-Please.
-Please.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:50.455
All right.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.508
Here's the deal.

01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:56.802
I'll listen to you...

01:10:57.628 --> 01:10:58.845
till this is empty.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:02.593
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:04.261
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:05.803
Wow.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.310
Finished. Bye.

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:11.309
Odin is dead.

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:16.906
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:20.326
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.

01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:21.868
I'm going to stop her.

01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:23.863
-Alone?
-Nope.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.330
I'm putting together a team.

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.284
It's me, you, and the big guy.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:30.879
No. No team. Only Hulk.

01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:32.630
It's me and you.

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:33.998
I think it's only you.

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:36.379
Wait. Just listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.886
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:40.880
I'm not getting dragged into

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:41.964
another one of Odin's
family squabbles.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.342
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Your sister.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.432
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:47.845
When it grew
beyond Odin's control

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:49.101
she massacred everyone
in the palace...

01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:50.731
and tried to seize the throne.

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.729
When she tried
to escape her banishment...

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:55.107
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.731
I only survived because...

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:01.863
Look, I already faced her once

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:03.695
back when I believed
in the throne...

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:05.033
and it cost me everything.

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:06.865
That's what's wrong
with Asgard.

01:12:06.948 --> 01:12:09.326
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:10.868
I agree.

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.163
Don't get familiar.

01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:15.040
I agree.

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.708
That's why I turned down
the throne.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.876
But this isn't
about the crown.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.007
This is about the people.

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:22.137
They're dying
and they're your people, too.

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:23.757
Forget it.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.134
I have.

01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:27.476
_kay.
- Q|<ay.

01:12:27.718 --> 01:12:28.810
-Good. Great.
-Great.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.012
Thank you.

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:31.684
-For what?
-For this.

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:35.234
Didn't see that,
did you?

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:38.817
There... That's better.

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.400
You know, go ahead.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:47.072
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.615
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

01:12:48.906 --> 01:12:49.998
But me...

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.919
I choose to run
toward my problems

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:55.121
and not away from them.

01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:57.506
Because that's what...

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:04.635
Because that's what heroes do.

01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:17.606
Friend stay!

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:30.786
Yes!

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:46.380

-Oh, thanks.

-What?

01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:53.883

at his house for awhile.

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:50.898
-I did?
-Yeah.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:53.025

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:56.805
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?

01:17:57.131 --> 01:17:58.758
He was interrupting.

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:00.806
That's not
a capital violation.

01:18:01.093 --> 01:18:02.265
Where was I?

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:05.147
My precious champion
has come up missing...

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:07.399
and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:09.647
It's all because of him.
Your brother.

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:12.779
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:13.939
I'm sure
there's a big history.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:15.191
And your contender...

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:16.942
My dear friend...

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.077
if you were to give me
12 hours,

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:20.530
I could bring them both
back to you. Alive.

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:22.201
I could do it in two.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.200
I could do it in one.

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:25.451
Let's stop there.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:27.377
You know what?
I woke up this morning

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.171
thinking about
a public execution.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:31.207
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.259
"Who's gonna get him first?"

01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:37.839
So, you're on the clock.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.932
What have you done?

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:42.260
I don't answer to you, lackey.

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.385
It's Loki.

01:18:43.594 --> 01:18:45.096
And you will answer
to the Grandmaster.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:48.057
Hmm.

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:51.068
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:52.603
I don't help anyone.

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:00.277
You're a Valkyrie.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:07.368
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:10.288
Choose your next words wisely.

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:13.716
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:09.021
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:11.564
The sun's going down.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.062
- It's getting real low.
- Oh, shoot.

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:15.653
-Sun's getting low.
-Would you stop saying that?

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:16.775
I just need you to stay calm.

01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:18.864
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:20.775
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

01:20:20.858 --> 01:20:21.905
Yeah. One.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:23.781
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:25.195
It's a new experience.

01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:27.327
My neurons,
they're firing faster

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:29.408
than my brain can handle
the information.

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.831
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:33.837
In the past, I always felt
like Hulk and I

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:35.209
each had a hand on the wheel.

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.254
But this time, it's like
he had the keys

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:38.880
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:40.924
All right, well, you're back
now. That's all that matters.

01:20:41.128 --> 01:20:42.175
No, it's not what matters.

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:43.426
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.052
if I turn into
the Hulk again...

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:46.676
Banner may never come back.

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:48.184
And we're stranded on a planet

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.012
that is designed
to stress me out.

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:51.221
We're not stranded.

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:52.648
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.183
Thank you.

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.518
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:57.899
What?

01:20:58.145 --> 01:20:59.738
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:02.487
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.485
who also happens
to be my sister.

01:21:04.735 --> 01:21:06.408
Okay, that is so wrong
on so many...

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:07.704
I don't wanna
fight your sister.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.032
That's a family issue.

01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:10.408
No, she's an evil being.

01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:12.289
I don't care what she is.

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:14.541
I'm not fighting any
more beings. I'm sick of it.

01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:15.788
-What?
-I just told you.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:17.623
If I turn into the Hulk,

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:18.878
I am never gonna
come back again.

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.130
And you don't care.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:22.010
No, no. I'm putting together
the team.

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:23.511
The Hulk is the fire.

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:25.469
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.136
-What? No!
-It's gross.

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:29.056
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

01:21:29.426 --> 01:21:31.053
No! I don't even
like the Hulk.

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:32.388
He's all like...

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:33.976
"Smash, smash, smash."

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.224
I prefer you.

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:37.142
Thanks.

01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:39.520
But if I'm being honest,

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:40.980
when it comes
to fighting evil beings...

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:42.527
he is very powerful
and useful.

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:44.654
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:46.034
ls he though?

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:48.320
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

01:21:48.529 --> 01:21:50.281
How many PhDs does
Banner have? Seven.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.117
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:55.165
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:00.336
What are you doing with that?

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:01.500
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.256
-I need a disguise.
-You are the disguise.

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:05.596
-I'll be Tony Stark.
-What?

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:07.556
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:10.259
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:11.726
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:12.970
Because you were naked.

01:22:13.137 --> 01:22:14.263
Okay, I'll give you that.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.397
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

01:22:16.473 --> 01:22:17.850
Tony wears his pants
superﬁght

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:18.934
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:21.270
-Why are you being so weird?
-I don't know.

01:22:21.562 --> 01:22:23.815
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:26.445
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:28.364
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.908
You're good. Calm down.
Come on.

01:22:31.155 --> 01:22:32.452
Listen, we're gonna
go to Asgard...

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:33.699
and you're not gonna
have to think about

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:34.783
the Hulk ever again.

01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:36.122
-All right?
-All right.

01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:41.878
Hulk!

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.427
Oh. This is bad.

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:50.933
Banner! Banner!

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.017
Banned

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:10.740
Banned

01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:12.404
Thor!

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:24.708
Hi.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.001
Hi.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:27.503
I was gonna do that.

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:28.712
Yeah, well, I did it first.

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:30.885
That's good.
What are you doing here?

01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:33.517
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:34.718
I got sidetracked.

01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:36.178
What's with the...

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:37.770
It's my disguise.

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:38.931
But I can see your face.

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:41.024
Not when I do this, you can't.

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:43.560
Your hair looks nice.
I like what you did with it.

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:45.066
Change it? Washed it maybe?

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:52.528
What are those things
on her eyes?

01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:53.954
Are those the people
that she's killed?

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:55.664
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.

01:23:55.948 --> 01:23:56.949
Who is this guy?

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.033
-He's a friend.
-Who? Me?

01:23:58.116 --> 01:23:59.459
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.624
I feel like I know you, too.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:08.168
Look, I've spent years
in a haze,

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:09.629
- trying to forget my past.
- Mmm.

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:11.467
Sakaar seemed like
the best place

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:13.800
to drink and forget,
and to die one day.

01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:15.801
I was thinking
that you drink too much,

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:17.261
and that probably
was gonna kill you.

01:24:17.427 --> 01:24:18.519
I don't plan to stop drinking.

01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:20.898
-Oh.
-But I don't wanna forget.

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:22.686
I can't turn away anymore...

01:24:23.433 --> 01:24:25.106
so if I'm gonna die...

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:26.987
well, it may as well be
driving my sword

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:28.439
through the heart
of that murderous hag.

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.198
- Good.
- Yeah.

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:33.361
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:35.286
Has it got a name?

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:38.161
Yeah, it's called
the Revengers.

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:39.533
Revengers?

01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:41.994
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:45.167
Do you want revenge?

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:47.458
I'm undecided.

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:48.750
Okay.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.136
Also, I've got
a peace offering.

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:56.266
Surprise.

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:03.266
Ow.

01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:04.733
Just had to be sure.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.521
Hello, Bruce.

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.691
So, last time I saw you,

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:13.900
you were trying
to kill everybody.

01:25:14.192 --> 01:25:15.284
Where are you at these days?

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:17.579
It varies
from moment to moment.

01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:19.873
ls that a Dragonfang?

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:21.624
It is.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:22.747
My God.

01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:25.795
This is the famed sword
of the Valkyrie.

01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:27.714
Sakaar and Asgard
are about as far apart

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:28.961
as any two known systems.

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:31.961
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:34.254
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard

01:25:34.338 --> 01:25:35.806
in 18 months.

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:39.218
Nope. We are going through
the big one.

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:40.469
The Devil's Anus?

01:25:40.844 --> 01:25:41.845
Anus?

01:25:42.012 --> 01:25:43.013
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:44.222
For the record, I didn't know

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:45.307
it was called that
when I picked it.

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:46.983
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star...

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:49.482
inside of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.067
We need another ship.

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:52.568
That would tear
mine to pieces.

01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:54.403
She's right. We need one
that can withstand

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:55.575
the geodetic strain
from the singularity.

01:25:55.859 --> 01:25:57.702
And has an offline
power steering system...

01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.406
that could also function
without the on-board computer.

01:26:00.697 --> 01:26:01.994
And we need one
with cup holders,

01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:03.621
because we're gonna die.
So, drinks!

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.790
Do I know you?
I feel like I know you.

01:26:06.036 --> 01:26:07.788
I feel like I know you, too.
It's weird.

01:26:08.038 --> 01:26:09.039
What do you say?

01:26:09.373 --> 01:26:10.374
Uncharted metagalactic travel

01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:11.674
through a volatile
cosmic gateway.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.092
Talk about an adventure.

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:15.382
-We need a ship.
-Need a ship.

01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:16.630
There are one or two ships.

01:26:16.713 --> 01:26:17.714
Absolute top of the line
models...

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:19.178
I don't mean to impose...

01:26:22.636 --> 01:26:24.183
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.

01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:26.265
I may even have stolen

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:28.316
the access codes
to his security system.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.601
And suddenly you're overcome

01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:30.777
with an urge
to do the right thing.

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:32.062
Heavens, no.

01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:33.772
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster...

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.698
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship...

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:39.031
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.

01:26:39.403 --> 01:26:40.746
You're telling us
that you can get us

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:41.947
access into the garage...

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.657
without setting off
any alarms?

01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:45.663
Yes, brother. I can.

01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:48.583
Okay, can I just...
A quick FYI.

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:50.463
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:53.084
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:54.425
He did try to kill me.

01:26:54.710 --> 01:26:56.428
Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:58.180
There was one time
when we were children...

01:26:58.422 --> 01:26:59.890
he transformed himself
into a snake,

01:26:59.965 --> 01:27:01.091
and he knows
that I love snakes.

01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:03.093
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

01:27:03.343 --> 01:27:04.765
and he transformed back
into himself

01:27:04.845 --> 01:27:05.971
and he was like,
"Yeah, it's me!"

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:09.100
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:10.772
If we're
boosting a ship...

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:12.478
we're gonna need to draw some
guards away from the palace.

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:14.025
Why not set the beast loose?

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:15.230
Shut up.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.481
You guys have a beast?

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:18.988
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:20.694
We're going to start
a revolution.

01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:22.245
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.

01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:24.994
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:28.327
ls that
some sort of protoplasm,

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.536
all the stuff
that's coming out of you...

01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:30.875
<i>or are they 999$?</i>

01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:33.498
Looks like eggs.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:36.968
Oh!

01:27:43.049 --> 01:27:44.266
I'm looking for Korg.

01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:45.806
Who's asking?

01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:47.144
I know you're asking.

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:49.306
Is anyone else asking,
or is it just you?

01:27:49.639 --> 01:27:51.607
The Lord of Thunder
sends his best.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.272
The revolution has begun.

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:59.529
Revolution?
How did this happen?

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:01.238
Don't know.

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:02.903
But the arena's mainframe

01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:04.579
for the Obedience Disks
have been deactivated...

01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:06.744
and the slaves
have armed themselves.

01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:08.875
Oh. I don't like that word.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:10.334
Which? Mainframe?

01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:12.579
No. Why would I not like
"mainframe"?

01:28:12.829 --> 01:28:14.797
No, the "S" word.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.589
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.344
Okay, that's better.

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:28.353
Hey, so, listen.
We should talk.

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:30.852
I disagree.

01:28:31.348 --> 01:28:34.147
Open communication
was never our family's forte.

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:35.519
You have no idea.

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:38.279
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

01:28:38.355 --> 01:28:39.356
Hello.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.441
Hi.

01:28:48.532 --> 01:28:50.079
Odin brought us together.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.958
It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.

01:29:00.085 --> 01:29:02.087
We might as well be
strangers now.

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:05.307
Two sons of the crown,
set adrift.

01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:07.555
Oh.

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:09.974
Thought you didn't
wanna talk about it.

01:29:11.471 --> 01:29:12.472
Here's the thing.

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:14.521
I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

01:29:14.724 --> 01:29:16.351
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:19.692
Did you just agree with me?

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.448
Come on, this place
is perfect for you.

01:29:21.731 --> 01:29:23.324
It's savage,
chaotic, lawless...

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:25.118
Brother, you're gonna do
great here.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.953
Do you truly think
so little of me?

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:30.824
Loki, lthought
the world of you.

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:34.502
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:37.505
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:40.668
I don't know, maybe
there's still good in you.

01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:42.089
But let's be honest,

01:29:42.168 --> 01:29:44.341
our paths diverged
a long time ago.

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:50.135
Yeah.

01:29:51.344 --> 01:29:52.391
It's probably for the best

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:53.596
that we never
see each other again.

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:54.981
That's what you always wanted.

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:00.987
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:02.230
-What?
-"Get Help."

01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:03.315
No.

01:30:03.398 --> 01:30:04.399
-Come on, you love it.
-I hate it.

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:05.483
It's great.
It works every time.

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:07.194
-It's humiliating.
-Do you have a better plan?

01:30:07.277 --> 01:30:08.824
-No.
-We're doing it.

01:30:08.987 --> 01:30:10.660
We are not doing "Get Help."

01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:12.954
Get help! Please!

01:30:13.199 --> 01:30:14.200
My brother, he's dying.

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:16.332
Get help! Help him!

01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:19.622
Classic.

01:30:19.789 --> 01:30:21.132
sun hate it.

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:23.586
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:25.883
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?

01:30:25.962 --> 01:30:26.963
<i>The Commodore.</i>

01:30:27.881 --> 01:30:28.882
Right.

01:30:31.635 --> 01:30:34.138
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.

01:30:36.389 --> 01:30:38.062
Oh, Loki.

01:30:39.309 --> 01:30:40.561
I know I've betrayed you
many times before...

01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:42.357
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.485
The reward for your capture

01:30:44.564 --> 01:30:45.656
will set me up nicely.

01:30:45.941 --> 01:30:47.363
Never one for sentiment,
were you?

01:30:47.734 --> 01:30:48.986
Easier to let it burn.

01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:50.320
I agree.

01:30:58.995 --> 01:31:00.497
Oh, that looks painful.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:03.963
Oh, dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.

01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:06.132
I trust you, you betray me.

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:08.384
Round and round
in circles we go.

01:31:08.672 --> 01:31:10.549
See, Loki, life is about,
it's about growth.

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:11.966
It's about change.

01:31:12.217 --> 01:31:15.187
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:17.518
I guess
what I'm trying to say...

01:31:17.764 --> 01:31:20.608
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief...

01:31:20.892 --> 01:31:22.235
but you could be more.

01:31:24.854 --> 01:31:26.777
I'll just put this over here
for you.

01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:30.744
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.

01:31:36.199 --> 01:31:37.451
All right,
I can figure this out.

01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:39.661
It's just another spaceship.

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:54.388
<i>Loyal</i> Sakaarians...

01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:56.511
<i>Lord of Thunder
has stolen my ship</i>

01:31:56.594 --> 01:31:57.971
<i>and my favorite champion.</i>

01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:02.692
<i>Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.</i>

01:32:02.892 --> 01:32:04.519
<i>Do not let him
leave this planet.</i>

01:32:17.741 --> 01:32:18.993
-Good shot!
-Thanks.

01:32:22.078 --> 01:32:23.079
Open the doors.

01:32:23.163 --> 01:32:24.460
Okay.

01:32:29.836 --> 01:32:31.588
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.

01:32:31.755 --> 01:32:32.802
Why?

01:32:45.351 --> 01:32:47.069
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?

01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:48.146
Yes, we should.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.232
Where are the guns
on this ship?

01:32:50.523 --> 01:32:51.820
<i>There</i> aren't any.

01:32:52.067 --> 01:32:53.535
- It's a leisure vessel.
<i>- What?</i>

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:55.320
Grandmaster uses it
for his good times,

01:32:55.445 --> 01:32:56.446
orgies and stuff.

01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:58.118
Did she just say
the Grandmaster

01:32:58.198 --> 01:32:59.324
uses it for orgies?

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:00.700
Yeah.

01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:02.247
Don't touch anything.

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:23.977
No!

01:33:26.976 --> 01:33:27.977
- No!
- No!

01:33:34.984 --> 01:33:36.031
Get inside!

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:37.741
In a minute.

01:33:49.165 --> 01:33:51.008
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

01:33:51.084 --> 01:33:52.461
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.

01:33:52.752 --> 01:33:54.504
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.

01:33:54.587 --> 01:33:57.807
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!

01:34:32.584 --> 01:34:33.585
Okay, come on.

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:35.716
There's gotta be a gun
on this thing.

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:36.838
That looks like a gun.

01:34:38.173 --> 01:34:39.470
<i>It's my birthday</i>

01:34:39.549 --> 01:34:40.596
<i>It's my birthday</i>

01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:42.552
<i>It's my birthday</i>

01:34:50.602 --> 01:34:51.694
Yeah!

01:35:09.245 --> 01:35:11.339
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!

01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:19.130
There she is.

01:35:19.422 --> 01:35:21.265
Our ticket out of here.

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:23.097
Hey, what's this?

01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:29.231
Thank you.

01:35:29.307 --> 01:35:31.810
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:32.894
You wanna come?

01:35:33.269 --> 01:35:35.897
You do seem like

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.482
you're in desperate need
of leadership.

01:35:37.899 --> 01:35:39.321
Why, thank you.

01:35:43.196 --> 01:35:44.197
Here we go.

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:51.746
Shit.

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:11.023
Asgardians...

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:13.689
some misguided soul...

01:36:14.644 --> 01:36:16.521
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

01:36:16.854 --> 01:36:19.073
Tell us where it is...

01:36:19.357 --> 01:36:21.860
or there will be consequences.

01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:26.823
Bad ones.

01:36:30.159 --> 01:36:31.160
Well?

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:39.294
You.

01:37:15.538 --> 01:37:19.509
Well? Executioner?

01:37:24.547 --> 01:37:25.764
Wait!

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:26.841
Wait!

01:37:29.218 --> 01:37:30.390
I know where the sword is.

01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:15.811
I never thought
I'd be back here.

01:38:19.477 --> 01:38:20.945
I thought
it'd be a lot nicer.

01:38:21.479 --> 01:38:22.947
I mean,
not that it's not nice.

01:38:23.022 --> 01:38:24.399
It's just, it's on fire.

01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:25.650
Here, up here
in the mountains.

01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:28.203
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.

01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:29.362
She's coming for them.

01:38:29.654 --> 01:38:30.655
Okay, drop me off
at the palace

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:32.866
-and I'll draw her away.
-And get yourself killed?

01:38:33.074 --> 01:38:34.747
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.

01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:36.169
While I'm dealing with Hela,
I need you two

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:37.336
to help get
everyone off Asgard.

01:38:37.787 --> 01:38:39.414
How the hell are we supposed
to do that?

01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:41.628
I have a man on the ground.

01:38:47.505 --> 01:38:48.506
Asgard.

01:38:52.135 --> 01:38:53.307
She's here.

01:39:05.022 --> 01:39:06.615
Now the ship has a gun.

01:39:06.858 --> 01:39:07.950
I'll take it from here.

01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:11.780
I found this in the armory.

01:39:15.158 --> 01:39:16.159
Good luck.

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:19.041
Your Majesty...

01:39:21.122 --> 01:39:22.169
don't die.

01:39:25.168 --> 01:39:26.795
You know what I mean.

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:27.605
We must keep moving!

01:40:28.397 --> 01:40:29.990
Go to the Bifrost!

01:41:12.775 --> 01:41:13.867
Sister.

01:41:16.153 --> 01:41:17.780
You're still alive.

01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:19.949
I love what you've done
with the place.

01:41:20.032 --> 01:41:21.375
Redecorating, I see.

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:23.790
It seems our father's solution

01:41:23.869 --> 01:41:26.338
to every problem
was to cover it up.

01:41:27.957 --> 01:41:29.459
Or to cast it out.

01:41:31.794 --> 01:41:35.219
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:37.175
You see?

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:39.973
You never knew him.

01:41:40.386 --> 01:41:42.138
Not at his best.

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:45.309
Odin and I drowned
entire civilizations

01:41:45.391 --> 01:41:46.893
in blood and tears.

01:41:47.184 --> 01:41:49.983
Where do you think
all this gold came from?

01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:51.864
And then, one day...

01:41:52.148 --> 01:41:55.027
he decided to become
a benevolent king.

01:41:55.359 --> 01:41:57.862
To foster peace,
to protect life...

01:41:59.113 --> 01:42:00.581
to have you.

01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:03.413
I understand why you're angry.

01:42:03.659 --> 01:42:05.127
And you are my sister,
and technically

01:42:05.202 --> 01:42:07.500
have a claim to the throne.

01:42:07.747 --> 01:42:09.670
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

01:42:09.749 --> 01:42:10.875
But it can't be you.

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:14.629
You're just...
The worst.

01:42:16.297 --> 01:42:17.844
Okay, get up.

01:42:18.215 --> 01:42:20.092
You're in my seat.

01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:23.137
You know,
Father once told me...

01:42:23.387 --> 01:42:25.856
that a wise king
never seeks out war.

01:42:26.098 --> 01:42:28.521
But must always
be ready for it.

01:43:00.925 --> 01:43:02.177
Go back!

01:43:07.348 --> 01:43:08.600
HEIMDALLI GO!

01:43:43.759 --> 01:43:46.137
To be honest, I expected more.

01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:50.391
Heimdall!

01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:54.354
The sword!

01:43:58.941 --> 01:44:00.409
Here's the difference
between us.

01:44:00.735 --> 01:44:02.203
I'm Odin's firstborn...

01:44:02.445 --> 01:44:04.743
the rightful heir,
the savior of Asgard.

01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:06.748
And you're nothing.

01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:19.800
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.090
Oh.

01:44:23.632 --> 01:44:25.760
Now you remind me of Dad.

01:44:36.145 --> 01:44:37.818
The stupid dog won't die!

01:44:59.919 --> 01:45:02.638
Everything's gonna be
all right now. I got this.

01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:05.098
You wanted to know who I am?

01:45:06.175 --> 01:45:07.677
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:09.265
You'll see!

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:00.146
You see?
No one's going anywhere.

01:46:00.437 --> 01:46:01.734
I'll get that sword...

01:46:01.897 --> 01:46:04.525
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

01:46:31.343 --> 01:46:32.595
Hey, man.

01:46:33.888 --> 01:46:35.140
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

01:46:35.389 --> 01:46:36.515
We're gonna jump
on that spaceship

01:46:36.599 --> 01:46:37.691
and get out of here.
Wanna come?

01:46:47.318 --> 01:46:51.073
Your savior is here.

01:46:58.704 --> 01:47:00.422
Did you miss me?

01:47:00.748 --> 01:47:01.965
Everyone, on that ship now.

01:47:06.503 --> 01:47:08.551
Welcome home.
I saw you coming.

01:47:08.839 --> 01:47:09.840
Of course you did.

01:47:26.690 --> 01:47:28.784
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

01:47:29.944 --> 01:47:30.991
You see...

01:47:31.862 --> 01:47:34.536
I'm not a queen or a monster.

01:47:36.659 --> 01:47:38.206
I'm the Goddess of Death.

01:47:39.453 --> 01:47:41.547
What were you
the god of, again?

01:47:53.175 --> 01:47:54.893
Even when you had two eyes...

01:47:55.761 --> 01:47:57.479
you'd see
only half the picture.

01:47:59.014 --> 01:48:01.858
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.

01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:06.606
Are you Thor,
the God of Hammers? Hmm?

01:48:09.858 --> 01:48:12.156
That hammer was to help you
control your power,

01:48:12.236 --> 01:48:13.488
to focus it.

01:48:14.405 --> 01:48:15.998
It was never your source
of strength.

01:48:16.907 --> 01:48:19.035
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.

01:48:20.285 --> 01:48:22.834
Asgard is not a place.
Never was.

01:48:24.206 --> 01:48:25.298
This could be Asgard.

01:48:26.667 --> 01:48:28.669
Asgard is where
our people stand.

01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:34.301
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.

01:48:42.141 --> 01:48:44.143
I'm not <i>as</i> strong as you.

01:48:47.021 --> 01:48:48.022
No...

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.692
you're stronger.

01:48:59.825 --> 01:49:01.077
Tell me, brother.

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:03.504
What were you
the god of again?

01:51:19.173 --> 01:51:21.221
-You're late.
-You're missing an eye.

01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:22.893
This isn't over.

01:51:30.142 --> 01:51:31.769
I think we should
disband the Revengers.

01:51:33.437 --> 01:51:34.484
Hit her
with a lightning blast.

01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:35.897
I just hit her with
the biggest lightning blast

01:51:35.981 --> 01:51:37.107
in the history of lightning.

01:51:37.191 --> 01:51:38.192
It did nothing.

01:51:41.987 --> 01:51:44.490
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

01:51:45.282 --> 01:51:46.659
It won't end there.

01:51:47.117 --> 01:51:50.371
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

01:51:50.704 --> 01:51:52.297
She'll hunt us down.

01:51:52.497 --> 01:51:53.919
We need to stop her
here and now.

01:51:54.208 --> 01:51:55.255
So what do we do?

01:51:56.251 --> 01:51:57.594
I'm not doing "Get Help."

01:52:09.973 --> 01:52:13.102
Asgard's not a place,
it's a people.

01:52:15.145 --> 01:52:16.146
Loki...

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.323
this was never about
stopping Ragnarok.

01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:20.526
This was about
causing Ragnarok.

01:52:20.734 --> 01:52:22.236
Surtur's crown, the vault.

01:52:24.112 --> 01:52:25.329
It's the only way.

01:52:26.031 --> 01:52:27.374
Bold move, brother.

01:52:28.784 --> 01:52:30.127
Even for me.

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:34.414
Shall we?

01:52:35.582 --> 01:52:36.583
After you.

01:53:02.276 --> 01:53:03.619
This is madness.

01:53:17.165 --> 01:53:18.667
Go! Go, now!

01:54:19.936 --> 01:54:21.233
For Asgard.

01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:36.877
Hela!

01:55:01.603 --> 01:55:05.608
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.

01:55:16.868 --> 01:55:18.370
Hela, enough!

01:55:22.207 --> 01:55:24.835
You want Asgard, it's yours.

01:55:25.335 --> 01:55:28.555
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.

01:55:28.797 --> 01:55:30.219
You can't defeat me.

01:55:31.091 --> 01:55:32.343
No, I know.

01:55:34.052 --> 01:55:35.053
But he can.

01:55:39.558 --> 01:55:40.650
No.

01:55:48.733 --> 01:55:52.033
Tremble before me, Asgard!

01:55:52.279 --> 01:55:54.407
I am your reckoning!

01:56:03.915 --> 01:56:05.337
The people are safe.

01:56:06.084 --> 01:56:07.757
That's all that matters.

01:56:09.671 --> 01:56:10.888
We're fulfilling
the prophecy.

01:56:11.631 --> 01:56:12.883
I hate this prophecy.

01:56:13.175 --> 01:56:14.848
So do I,
but we have no choice.

01:56:15.135 --> 01:56:16.808
Surtur destroys Asgard...

01:56:17.095 --> 01:56:19.314
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.

01:56:19.431 --> 01:56:21.024
But we need to let him
finish the job,

01:56:21.099 --> 01:56:22.191
otherwise...

01:56:23.935 --> 01:56:24.936
No!

01:56:27.439 --> 01:56:29.282
Hulk, stop, you moron!

01:56:38.492 --> 01:56:39.539
Hulk, stop.

01:56:39.784 --> 01:56:42.628
Just for once in your life,
don't smash.

01:56:43.997 --> 01:56:45.590
Big monster!

01:56:46.041 --> 01:56:47.133
Let's g0!

01:56:49.002 --> 01:56:50.003
Fine.

01:57:14.194 --> 01:57:16.868
I am Asgard's doom!

01:57:40.053 --> 01:57:42.021
The damage is not too bad.

01:57:42.305 --> 01:57:44.182
As long as the foundations
are still strong...

01:57:44.474 --> 01:57:45.817
we can rebuild this place.

01:57:46.268 --> 01:57:48.362
It will become a haven...

01:57:48.645 --> 01:57:51.364
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.

01:57:58.405 --> 01:58:00.749
Now those foundations
are gone. Sorry.

01:58:15.964 --> 01:58:17.762
What have I done?

01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:21.348
You saved us from extinction.

01:58:21.636 --> 01:58:23.229
Asgard is not a place...

01:58:25.015 --> 01:58:26.562
it's a people.

01:58:55.879 --> 01:58:57.301
It suits you.

01:59:00.175 --> 01:59:02.519
Maybe you're not so bad
after all, brother.

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:04.016
Maybe not.

01:59:05.472 --> 01:59:06.519
Thank you.

01:59:07.432 --> 01:59:09.605
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.

01:59:14.105 --> 01:59:15.277
I'm here.

01:59:39.506 --> 01:59:40.758
Your throne.

01:59:56.064 --> 01:59:58.988
So. King of Asgard.

02:00:09.661 --> 02:00:10.662
Where to?

02:00:11.913 --> 02:00:13.165
I'm not sure.

02:00:13.915 --> 02:00:15.007
Any Suggestions?

02:00:17.877 --> 02:00:19.595
Miek, where are you from?

02:00:19.963 --> 02:00:21.761
Oh, Miek's dead.

02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:25.052
Yeah, no, I accidentally
stomped on him on the bridge.

02:00:25.218 --> 02:00:26.561
I've just felt so guilty,

02:00:26.636 --> 02:00:27.808
I've been carrying him around
all day.

02:00:29.973 --> 02:00:31.896
Miek, you're alive!

02:00:31.975 --> 02:00:33.147
He's alive, guys.

02:00:33.226 --> 02:00:34.398
What was
your question again, bro?

02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:37.230
Earth it is.

02:02:53.992 --> 02:02:55.414
Do you really think
it's a good idea

02:02:55.493 --> 02:02:56.585
to go back to Earth?

02:02:57.161 --> 02:02:58.162
Yes, of course.

02:02:58.246 --> 02:03:00.340
The people of Earth love me.
I'm very popular.

02:03:00.874 --> 02:03:02.672
Let me rephrase that.

02:03:03.042 --> 02:03:04.840
Do you really think
it's a good idea

02:03:04.919 --> 02:03:06.296
to bring me back to Earth?

02:03:06.963 --> 02:03:08.931
Probably not, to be honest.

02:03:09.007 --> 02:03:10.725
I wouldn't worry, brother.

02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:13.804
I feel like everything's
gonna work out fine.

02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:43.901
Oh, boy.

02:09:50.491 --> 02:09:52.209
on.

02:09:52.285 --> 02:09:56.290
I just gotta say,
I'm proud of you all.

02:09:56.706 --> 02:09:59.926
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!

02:10:00.293 --> 02:10:02.671
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.

02:10:02.753 --> 02:10:05.006
Come on. No?

02:10:05.548 --> 02:10:07.550
Me too. 'Cause I've been
a big part of it.

02:10:07.633 --> 02:10:10.432
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.

02:10:10.511 --> 02:10:12.388
So, you're welcome.

02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:14.933
And, uh, it's a tie.
