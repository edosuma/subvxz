WEBVTT

00:05.588 --> 00:07.757
[gun cocks and fires]

00:09.843 --> 00:12.387
[cheering and applause]

00:16.808 --> 00:19.936
[announcer]  Chicago, are you ready?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.397
[cheering and applause]

00:22.480 --> 00:26.443
Party goblins, are you ready?

00:26.526 --> 00:28.111
[cheering and applause]

00:28.194 --> 00:29.738
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:29.821 --> 00:31.573
please welcome to the stage,

00:31.656 --> 00:33.825
Iliza!

00:33.908 --> 00:37.912
[cheering and applause]

00:44.794 --> 00:47.130
[cheering and applause]

00:51.176 --> 00:53.803
-Chicago!
-[cheering]

00:53.887 --> 00:55.889
-Thank you!
-[cheering]

00:57.724 --> 00:59.100
Thank you for having me.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.686
I'd like to discuss something with you.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.857
There are two kinds of hungover.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.650
[laughter]

01:07.734 --> 01:10.820
There's the kind of hungover
where you wake up the next morning

01:10.904 --> 01:14.407
and you're like,
"What? I touched his penis over his jeans?

01:14.491 --> 01:17.786
-It's okay, I'm sassy." And then...
-[laughter]

01:17.869 --> 01:22.832
there's the kind of hungover
where whatever happened the night before

01:22.916 --> 01:25.084
wasn't even your fault.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.669
[laughter]

01:26.753 --> 01:30.381
Because you weren't mentally present
for any of it.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.091
[laughter]

01:32.675 --> 01:36.012
[in croaky voice] For 'twas not you
that was is charge.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.430
[laughter]

01:37.514 --> 01:41.017
'Twas your party goblin!

01:41.100 --> 01:43.812
[cheering and applause]

01:43.895 --> 01:45.647
Yeah.

01:47.732 --> 01:51.611
Just so you know, your party goblin
sleeps in the back of your brain.

01:51.694 --> 01:54.072
For those of you
that are unfamiliar with my work,

01:54.155 --> 01:56.032
she sleeps in the back of your brain

01:56.116 --> 01:58.868
and she waits... [snorts]
on a pile of rags... [snorts]

01:58.952 --> 02:02.455
and regrets... [snorts]
and old Tiger Beat magazines. She waits!

02:03.039 --> 02:05.125
-[laughter]
-For the perfect opportunity.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.835
[laughter]

02:06.918 --> 02:08.836
She's back there in your brain,

02:08.919 --> 02:10.880
sleeping her goblin sleep, just...

02:10.964 --> 02:13.883
-[snorts and sighs]
-[laughter]

02:13.967 --> 02:16.177
-[snorts and sighs]
-[laughter]

02:16.261 --> 02:18.429
[snorts] Channing Tatum, stick of butter.
[snorts]

02:18.513 --> 02:21.266
[laughter]

02:21.349 --> 02:23.184
[applause]

02:25.186 --> 02:27.730
-And she will awaken...
-[laughter]

02:27.814 --> 02:29.816
when she hears you say...

02:30.608 --> 02:33.945
"I guess I'll just come out
for one drink."

02:34.028 --> 02:35.613
[snarls]

02:35.697 --> 02:38.241
[laughter and applause]

02:38.324 --> 02:41.244
[cheering]

02:45.039 --> 02:47.292
"I'll just come out for one

02:47.375 --> 02:49.294
because I have to be up early."

02:49.377 --> 02:51.713
[screams]

02:53.173 --> 02:55.884
Eat that sandwich out of the garbage

02:55.967 --> 02:57.886
and text your ex-boyfriend
that you love him

02:57.969 --> 03:00.555
then turn your phone off!

03:00.638 --> 03:03.808
[cheering]

03:03.892 --> 03:07.729
[cheering and applause]

03:10.148 --> 03:14.903
And by the way, there is zero culpability
on the part of your party goblin.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.238
She's not there the next morning

03:17.322 --> 03:19.908
like, "Oh, my God, are you okay?
Do you need Pedialyte?"

03:19.991 --> 03:21.034
No!

03:21.117 --> 03:22.452
She doesn't give a fuck.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.747
She straight up ghosts at, like, 3:00 a.m.

03:25.830 --> 03:29.500
when you're shit-faced
in the back of an Uber, right?

03:29.584 --> 03:31.794
You scooped yourself
into the back of this car.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.881
Your crowing achievement of the evening
is that you didn't die.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.424
[laughter]

03:36.507 --> 03:38.801
And we've all had that moment.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.888
Anybody that's been out drinking,
you've been out, it's been loud,

03:41.971 --> 03:46.184
there's been yelling, dancing, you stole
an ambulance, it's been a crazy night.

03:46.893 --> 03:50.396
We've all had that moment
of solitary drunken serenity

03:50.480 --> 03:53.107
where you get in the back of the car
and you shut the door

03:53.191 --> 03:55.777
and for the first time all night
it's quiet.

03:55.860 --> 03:56.778
[laughter]

03:56.861 --> 03:59.614
And you think, "Oh, my God, I made it."

03:59.697 --> 04:02.533
[laughter]

04:02.617 --> 04:04.494
Followed by, "I'm gonna throw up."

04:04.577 --> 04:07.664
And the car is going,
you're like, "Oh, fuck!"

04:07.747 --> 04:09.415
You're trying to hold it in, right?

04:09.499 --> 04:12.252
You roll the window down.
You're like, "Agh! It's too much air!"

04:12.335 --> 04:14.712
You roll the window back up.
You're like, "Too much me!"

04:14.796 --> 04:16.839
You crack the window. You're like, "No!"

04:16.923 --> 04:21.511
The vomit's coming up. It's right here,
like A1 Steak Sauce, it gets you here.

04:21.594 --> 04:25.098
You're like, "Uhh!" You're trying to focus
on anything to distract you.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.683
You're listening to the radio.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.060
For the first time ever,
you're paying attention

04:29.143 --> 04:31.145
to the words of a Pitbull song.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.022
-You're like...
-[laughter]

04:33.106 --> 04:35.566
♪ Uno, dos, tres... ♪
We get it! We get it!

04:35.650 --> 04:36.818
[laughter]

04:36.901 --> 04:40.488
You look at party goblin, she's loving it.
She's got her head out her window like...

04:40.571 --> 04:42.073
[screams]

04:42.156 --> 04:43.866
[laughter]

04:43.950 --> 04:46.536
And you know
it's your party goblin that got you

04:46.619 --> 04:49.455
by the manner in which
you wake up the next morning.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.666
If you wake up. If you wake up, Chicago.

04:51.749 --> 04:52.875
[laughter]

04:52.959 --> 04:56.713
You wake up... When party goblin gets you,
you wake up on your couch.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.799
Beds are for closers.
You wake up on your couch, okay?

05:00.550 --> 05:03.011
You ever pass out on a pillow so hard,

05:03.094 --> 05:05.805
you get a cushion scar
down the side of your face?

05:05.888 --> 05:08.808
[laughter]

05:08.891 --> 05:12.353
And you wake up, no idea where you are,
no idea where you were.

05:12.437 --> 05:16.149
You check your wrist, it's just
a dirty patchwork of entry stamps.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.567
[laughter]

05:17.650 --> 05:19.027
Putting the pieces together

05:19.110 --> 05:21.529
from the night before
is like the plot from  Memento.

05:21.612 --> 05:22.655
No idea.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.614
[laughter]

05:24.407 --> 05:27.368
You check your Instagram feed,
it's a blurry feed of pictures

05:27.452 --> 05:29.495
you took of your own face from this angle.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.456
[laughter and cheering]

05:31.539 --> 05:35.168
It's just me and three girls in a bathroom
in East LA like, "Squad goals."

05:35.251 --> 05:36.711
Who the fuck are they?

05:36.794 --> 05:38.129
[laughter]

05:38.212 --> 05:40.631
I don't know,
but I think I'm in the gang now, right?

05:41.466 --> 05:43.676
No idea what you did the night before.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.722
We... I... You know when party goblin
gets you by the amount that you sleep.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.600
I slept for 15 hours the other day.

05:51.225 --> 05:54.228
-I slept so long, my muscles atrophied.
-[laughter]

05:54.312 --> 05:56.022
Okay? I turned to fucking stone.

05:56.105 --> 05:56.981
You ever pass out

05:57.065 --> 05:59.400
with your full body weight
on your hands, like...

05:59.484 --> 06:02.653
[laughter]

06:02.737 --> 06:06.324
No blood in, no blood out. Your hands
are just purple, bloated flippers.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.159
[laughter]

06:08.242 --> 06:10.369
I slept so long, I almost died.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.830
Like, there was a point
at around 4:00 p.m.

06:12.914 --> 06:16.042
where my soul was like,
"Should I just go?"

06:16.125 --> 06:19.337
[laughter]

06:19.420 --> 06:22.215
[cheering]

06:24.884 --> 06:26.677
There's different kinds of drunk.

06:26.761 --> 06:30.473
Some people think they get smarter when
they're drunk, some people wanna talk.

06:30.556 --> 06:34.018
The Latin phrase is  in vino veritas,
which means, "in wine, there's truth,"

06:34.102 --> 06:37.063
which is why when girls get drunk,
we're always like,

06:37.146 --> 06:39.107
"Can I just tell you a secret?"

06:39.190 --> 06:42.360
[laughter and applause]

06:45.238 --> 06:48.116
[laughter]

06:49.242 --> 06:50.952
"I don't have a neck."

06:51.035 --> 06:52.328
[laughter]

06:55.498 --> 06:57.708
I don't really make
a lot of drunk mistakes

06:57.792 --> 07:00.878
but I worry when I make dumb decisions
when I'm drunk for this simple fact.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.464
In my group of friends, I'm the alpha.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.591
I decide what we do. Obviously.

07:05.675 --> 07:09.720
I pick the restaurants, I pick the bars,
mostly because no one cares,

07:09.804 --> 07:11.514
but I am the decision-maker.

07:11.597 --> 07:15.101
And what worries me is,
if I'm doing stupid shit when I'm drunk,

07:15.184 --> 07:18.104
what hope do the sheep who I lead have...

07:18.187 --> 07:20.440
[cheering and applause]

07:20.523 --> 07:22.316
if that's my example?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.445
So this is the story of one such night.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.488
So, we were out the other night
and we were

07:27.572 --> 07:28.656
shit-canned.

07:28.739 --> 07:32.827
Like, the kind of drunk
where you can't even read.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.413
[applause]

07:35.496 --> 07:39.000
And then you realize it's because...
you're in China Town.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.419
[laughter]

07:41.502 --> 07:43.921
[cheering]

07:44.005 --> 07:45.923
[applause]

07:47.008 --> 07:49.510
[laughter]

07:49.594 --> 07:53.806
Actually, you know you're fucked up when
you're in China Town and you  can  read.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.517
Ohhh!

07:56.601 --> 08:00.021
-Ancient secrets, not so hidden. So...
-[laughter]

08:00.104 --> 08:05.818
We're drunk and we're walking through
China Town and we walk into a bar.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.070
I'm reticent to say that it's a club
because I'm 33,

08:08.154 --> 08:11.073
but there was a dance floor, a DJ
and I had on a little body glitter, okay!

08:11.157 --> 08:14.243
[laughter]

08:14.327 --> 08:17.622
You're probably wondering,
"Why are you wearing body glitter?"

08:17.705 --> 08:19.290
I will tell you, Chicago.

08:19.373 --> 08:22.793
Because my date was late to pick me up.
Gentlemen!

08:23.461 --> 08:24.837
[laughter]

08:24.921 --> 08:26.797
You need to know this about women.

08:26.881 --> 08:30.468
When we get ready,
we have a list of things we do

08:30.551 --> 08:32.636
to reach our most attractive point.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.682
There is an apex,
nay, a pinnacle of beauty...

08:37.225 --> 08:39.477
that women reach
when they're getting ready.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.562
And every minute you're late to get us

08:41.645 --> 08:44.065
is one more minute
we spend doubting ourselves,

08:44.148 --> 08:47.652
dicking with our makeup,
and we get incrementally uglier...

08:47.735 --> 08:50.071
-[laughter]
-as time goes on.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.199
[cheering and applause]

08:55.910 --> 08:58.996
One time, my date was an hour late,
I grew a tail.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.082
[laughter]

09:01.666 --> 09:03.960
This guy was only 30 minutes late,
thank God.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.797
He walks in, I'm on the ground,
there's caboodle shrapnel everywhere.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.716
I've got a Wet N Wild lip gloss wand,

09:10.800 --> 09:12.510
I'm like, "I'm a pretty girl!"

09:12.593 --> 09:14.220
[laughter]

09:14.303 --> 09:15.846
"Save yourself."

09:15.930 --> 09:17.473
[laughter]

09:17.557 --> 09:20.142
But what happens is, we have time,

09:20.226 --> 09:23.229
so we start to add things,
doubt ourselves.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.898
-That's where I found that glitter.
-[laughter]

09:25.982 --> 09:28.109
"He's not here. [gasps] What's this?"

09:28.943 --> 09:32.446
In hindsight, it wasn't body glitter,
it was straight-up craft glitter.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.781
[laughter]

09:33.864 --> 09:36.325
But I was like, "I'm gonna put it
on my face, make it dainty."

09:36.409 --> 09:39.870
Do you ever feel that? Do you ever feel
that you can make something work?

09:39.954 --> 09:42.331
Do you ever feel that
because you're not trashy,

09:42.415 --> 09:45.042
you can pull off
doing something that's trashy?

09:45.126 --> 09:47.753
[cheering]

09:49.547 --> 09:52.675
You're like, "I can wear
fishnet stockings, I went to Stanford."

09:52.758 --> 09:54.594
Like it's okay for some reason.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.220
[laughter]

09:56.304 --> 09:58.055
That's how I felt about that body glitter.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.267
I was like, "I'll just do a little bit.
I'll do a classy amount.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.102
I'm just gonna do a little bit."

10:03.185 --> 10:06.147
Fun fact, you know what body glitter
up close looks like? Conjunctivitis.

10:06.230 --> 10:08.190
-Like, real up close.
-[laughter]

10:08.274 --> 10:13.279
"I'll do a little." Five minutes later,
"Maybe just highlight the orbital rim.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.448
That way when we're dancing,

10:15.531 --> 10:18.534
the light will hit it and it'll be like,
'Bing, anime! Ah!'

10:18.618 --> 10:20.411
Keep going. Keep going."

10:20.494 --> 10:23.164
Five more minutes later,
"Maybe I'll bring a little bit down here

10:23.247 --> 10:28.377
and highlight the jawbone so he knows I,
what, come from good chewing stock?"

10:28.461 --> 10:29.587
[laughter]

10:29.670 --> 10:32.423
Five more minutes later, sparkle fish!
So now...

10:32.506 --> 10:34.258
[laughter]

10:34.342 --> 10:37.637
I look like a goddamn road flare
and we're in public. So...

10:37.720 --> 10:39.764
[laughter]

10:39.847 --> 10:45.102
We walk into this bar and one of
the difficult parts about being a woman,

10:45.186 --> 10:47.438
besides everything, is that...

10:48.189 --> 10:49.273
It's really hard.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.735
Is that you're constantly battling
with yourself.

10:52.818 --> 10:56.864
In the long run, we're battling
our weight, hair color, wrinkles.

10:56.947 --> 11:00.993
Minute to minute, it's just
an adjustment of your hair and your bra

11:01.077 --> 11:02.828
and your underwear and your makeup

11:02.912 --> 11:04.664
and your mustache,
braid it, bead it, set it.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.208
-You're always doing something.
-[laughter]

11:07.833 --> 11:11.712
Because if one thing is off,
then the night is ruined, Scott, okay?

11:12.630 --> 11:14.965
One time,
I left my house without mascara on.

11:15.049 --> 11:18.844
I did a U-turn on a four-lane highway.
Like, "No!"

11:18.928 --> 11:19.762
[laughter]

11:19.845 --> 11:22.556
"They will see the whites of my eyes!"

11:22.640 --> 11:25.017
[laughter]

11:26.143 --> 11:29.688
Everything has to be perfect.
And guys, it's exhausting.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.482
It's exhausting being a girl.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.360
Did you know, fun scientific fact
that I made up on the way here,

11:34.443 --> 11:38.406
that women get four minutes
out of every night,

11:38.489 --> 11:40.950
four minutes out of every night

11:41.033 --> 11:43.077
where our brain sends a message
to our body saying,

11:43.160 --> 11:45.246
"Everything's okay, stop messing with it"?

11:45.329 --> 11:47.581
Four minutes out of every night

11:47.665 --> 11:49.875
where your brain sends a message
to your body like,

11:49.959 --> 11:52.253
"Homeostasis achieved." You're like...

11:52.336 --> 11:55.214
[laughter]

11:55.297 --> 11:58.884
[cheering and applause]

12:01.762 --> 12:04.265
And the rest of the time,
it's just mayhem!

12:04.348 --> 12:08.894
Everything has to be perfect. So,
we walk into this bar, my first thought...

12:09.854 --> 12:12.148
"I gotta fix my lip liner. Now!"

12:12.231 --> 12:13.274
[laughter]

12:13.357 --> 12:15.693
I'm not even a big lip liner wearer,

12:15.776 --> 12:17.736
but in that moment, 'twas everything.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.865
In that moment,
I believed fixing my lip liner

12:20.948 --> 12:23.492
is what stood between me
and eternal happiness, okay?

12:23.576 --> 12:28.038
I had to take a liner, I had to find
my liner and line my chola lips, okay?

12:28.122 --> 12:29.748
-That's what I had to do.
-[applause]

12:29.832 --> 12:33.210
So glad that got a response.
In North Carolina, nothing. Okay.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.087
[laughter]

12:35.171 --> 12:39.675
[cheering and applause]

12:40.634 --> 12:44.263
Had to fix my lip liner,
had to be right then.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.390
To the gentlemen in the room,

12:46.474 --> 12:48.851
I don't expect you
to understand the urgency

12:48.934 --> 12:50.811
with which I had to fix my lip liner.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.106
The only thing I could liken it to
in male culture is, like...

12:54.940 --> 12:57.151
when you feel
you have to adjust your balls.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.235
[laughter]

12:58.319 --> 13:00.154
Similar immediacy.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.032
As we've seen, unfortunately.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.742
[laughter]

13:04.825 --> 13:08.996
When you feel that's gotta happen,
it's gotta happen now! Go! Go! Go!

13:09.079 --> 13:12.791
In front of children, Christmas Eve,
family portrait, messing with my dick.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.043
[laughter and cheering]

13:14.126 --> 13:17.129
♪ Messing with my dick in public ♪

13:17.213 --> 13:18.589
Wahoo!

13:19.798 --> 13:22.510
♪ It's a dick puzzle
and I'm solving it now ♪

13:22.593 --> 13:24.970
♪ Maximum comfort at any cost ♪

13:25.054 --> 13:27.097
♪ This is my right,
Nancy, get off my back ♪

13:27.181 --> 13:29.058
-So...
-[laughter]

13:29.141 --> 13:32.269
So many guys right now have to adjust.
They're like, "I'm not gonna do it!"

13:32.353 --> 13:34.772
[laughter]

13:35.773 --> 13:37.566
[laughter]

13:37.650 --> 13:39.693
I believe that's what Elvis was doing.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.946
[laughter]

13:42.029 --> 13:43.405
Makes sense.

13:45.699 --> 13:49.119
Needed my liner. Now you understand
that I needed it, guys, okay?

13:49.203 --> 13:53.874
Needed the fucking liner. That means
I had to find the liner in my bag.

13:55.042 --> 13:59.088
-However, I had a big bag.
-[laughter]

13:59.171 --> 14:02.800
There's a very specific way
that women will search for something

14:02.883 --> 14:04.843
when we have a big bag.

14:04.927 --> 14:09.014
What do you do?
You take a designated search claw...

14:09.098 --> 14:10.975
[laughter]

14:11.058 --> 14:12.852
and you plunge it.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.771
[laughter]

14:17.147 --> 14:20.234
[cheering]

14:20.317 --> 14:22.820
[applause]

14:24.405 --> 14:27.491
Never breaking eye contact with your prey,
I mean your date.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.118
[laughter]

14:29.201 --> 14:32.121
Notice I haven't blinked, Chicago.
Dedication acting.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.749
[cheering]

14:35.833 --> 14:38.168
[applause]

14:38.252 --> 14:40.588
The constant eye contact
being a reminder that,

14:40.671 --> 14:44.800
yes, I can multitask and keep talking.
I'll make a great partner. Marry me.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.386
[laughter]

14:47.469 --> 14:49.138
Meanwhile, to the outside world,

14:49.221 --> 14:51.849
it looks like you're wrestling
with a very small bass.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.810
If you're a pro,
you keep conversation moving.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.895
Still haven't blinked.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.230
If you're a pro,
you keep conversation moving.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.108
"I'm listening. Keep talking.
Keep talking. I can look and listen.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.652
Say FanDuel one more time, motherfucker.
I'm listening."

15:03.736 --> 15:07.197
[laughter and applause]

15:09.366 --> 15:12.077
You're digging around in there.
Meanwhile, as a woman,

15:12.161 --> 15:15.247
you're having to come to terms
with the seventh layer of hell

15:15.331 --> 15:17.458
that is the bottom of your bag.

15:17.541 --> 15:22.171
It's just a graveyard of dismembered pens,
there's coins.

15:22.254 --> 15:27.927
Why is there always a Nature's Valley
granola bar crumbled... at the bottom?

15:28.010 --> 15:31.013
[cheering and applause]

15:31.096 --> 15:35.225
You stick your hand down, you come up
with oats between your fingernails.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.936
You're like, "Ow! Ow!"

15:37.728 --> 15:39.104
[laughter]

15:39.188 --> 15:41.690
Digging around.
A gym lock, a phone charger,

15:41.774 --> 15:42.942
a concealer without its lid.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.735
Why? Why can't we make them

15:44.818 --> 15:46.528
with retractable lids
that don't break off?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.489
Because you stick your hand down there,

15:48.572 --> 15:51.951
unknowingly you come up
with one creamy finger. You're like, "No!"

15:52.034 --> 15:54.453
-[laughter]
-"No!"

15:54.536 --> 15:56.997
But it was expensive,
so you're like, "No!"

15:57.081 --> 15:59.083
[laughter]

15:59.166 --> 16:01.794
[cheering]

16:01.877 --> 16:04.463
So now you look amazing.
Keep looking, keep looking.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.591
Bits of paper. A sock. Keep looking.
Tampon out of its wrapper.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.135
Maybe I keep it.
No, I'll get sick. Digging around.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.471
If it's out of the wrapper, don't keep it.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.349
Sometimes it's like, "I'll just..."
Don't blow on it and...

16:15.432 --> 16:18.686
You're gonna get dysentery,
you'll never finish the Oregon Trail.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.188
[laughter and cheering]

16:26.318 --> 16:30.197
Seven or eight seconds go by,
I cannot find my lip liner.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.742
Seven or eight seconds go by,
which in girl years is, like, forever,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.536
I cannot find my lip liner.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.247
So, what's a logical thing to do?

16:38.330 --> 16:39.707
Maybe use the other hand

16:39.790 --> 16:42.292
to add to the search, right?
To aid in the excavation.

16:42.376 --> 16:46.005
Maybe get a cellular device
to illuminate the situation.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.508
Not me!
I dropped to my knees on a dance floor,

16:49.591 --> 16:52.136
dumped out the bag
and start sifting through it

16:52.219 --> 16:55.264
like Helen Keller
learning how to spell water.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.851
[laughter and applause]

17:02.563 --> 17:05.482
Fun fact. Girls,
if you wanna let people around you know

17:05.566 --> 17:09.403
that you're absolutely not
on the same mental playing field as them,

17:09.486 --> 17:12.990
a great way to do it, I found,
is to dump our personal property

17:13.073 --> 17:17.578
onto a shared communal space, because that
immediately lets other bar-goers know,

17:17.661 --> 17:18.912
"I don't give a fuck!"

17:18.996 --> 17:20.497
[laughter]

17:20.580 --> 17:22.249
"Where is it?"

17:23.083 --> 17:25.961
This body language, this body language,

17:26.045 --> 17:29.590
-this feral-raccoon-like body language...
-[laughter]

17:29.673 --> 17:32.301
was enough to alert the door guy.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.427
[laughter]

17:33.510 --> 17:36.847
You're a door guy at a busy nightclub,
you've got a lot to deal with.

17:36.930 --> 17:41.977
However, he found
my witch over a cauldron behavior...

17:42.853 --> 17:46.356
threatening enough to leave his post,
flashlight in hand,

17:46.440 --> 17:48.567
and walk up to me.

17:48.650 --> 17:53.072
He was a big guy. He was, like, six-eight,
black guy, good-looking.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.782
[laughter]

17:54.865 --> 17:57.534
-I had to say he was good-looking.
-[laughter]

17:57.618 --> 17:59.453
Because I said he was black.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.998
[laughter]

18:04.208 --> 18:08.003
Seems to be the face of thinly-veiled
political correctness in our country,

18:08.087 --> 18:10.380
if you say someone's color,
other than white,

18:10.464 --> 18:13.175
you must assign them an accolade,
deserved or otherwise,

18:13.258 --> 18:15.636
to prove that you're not racist,
when in the first place,

18:15.719 --> 18:16.929
I wasn't fucking racist,

18:17.012 --> 18:20.474
I was giving you an accurate depiction
of the events that transpired.

18:20.557 --> 18:23.560
I didn't see his face!
Dude had a flashlight in my eye!

18:23.644 --> 18:25.813
[laughter]

18:25.896 --> 18:29.691
[cheering and applause]

18:31.026 --> 18:34.947
I can tell you this much. Black, white
or other, there's no way he was hot.

18:35.030 --> 18:38.450
He's six-eight. They get weird-looking
after a certain height, okay?

18:38.534 --> 18:40.744
Structurally, it gets weird. Okay.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.747
I am not wrong. #IAmNotWrong
Okay, so...

18:43.831 --> 18:45.874
[laughter]

18:45.958 --> 18:47.251
It's true.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.586
There's no hot giants.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.380
[laughter]

18:51.463 --> 18:53.423
So he Shreks up to me...

18:53.507 --> 18:56.677
[laughter]

18:56.760 --> 19:00.013
And I feel his presence and I see
the ball of light and I hear his voice

19:00.097 --> 19:02.724
and he goes,
"Everything a'ight over here?"

19:02.808 --> 19:07.146
Fucking no, dude, everything is most
definitely not a'ight. I'm on the floor.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.355
[laughter]

19:08.438 --> 19:11.191
I don't exist on this plane.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.236
Fun fact about being on the floor.

19:14.319 --> 19:18.365
As an adult, when you choose to take it
to this place, you lose all credibility.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.785
Nobody wants to hear the prerogative
of someone on the floor.

19:21.869 --> 19:26.665
If you have to crane your neck up
to explain yourself, you are fucked, okay?

19:27.416 --> 19:28.458
You don't believe me?

19:28.542 --> 19:31.670
You ever tried to get the life story
of someone sitting on a curb? No.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.422
Because they were sitting
on a fucking curb

19:33.505 --> 19:35.340
and you didn't wanna talk to them.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.676
They were someone who's drunk,
on a lot of meth

19:37.759 --> 19:41.680
or like a really pissed off bridesmaid
just waiting for the service to be over.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.473
[laughter]

19:43.557 --> 19:47.019
But now I'm on the floor and I'm nervous
because that's an authority figure

19:47.102 --> 19:49.980
and in my head I'm like,
"Oh, fuck, I'm gonna go a bar jail."

19:50.063 --> 19:51.690
[laughter]

19:51.773 --> 19:53.859
"What if they repossess my wedges?"

19:53.942 --> 19:55.611
[laughter]

19:55.694 --> 19:57.446
But I was drunk and in my head I'm like,

19:57.529 --> 19:59.823
"It's cool. Be smart.
Explain what you're doing.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.992
Whatever you do, Iliza,
just sound intelligent."

20:02.075 --> 20:04.244
Instead, what came out of my mouth was,

20:04.328 --> 20:06.788
"I gotta find my lip liner, man!" And...

20:06.872 --> 20:07.998
[laughter]

20:08.081 --> 20:12.336
what I feel he understood,
nay respected, nay...

20:12.836 --> 20:14.046
Neigh.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.798
[laughter]

20:16.882 --> 20:20.969
[cheering and applause]

20:23.430 --> 20:25.057
resonated with

20:25.140 --> 20:27.184
wasn't that I had to find my lip liner.

20:27.267 --> 20:32.356
What I feel he understood was
the sheer amount of white-girl crazy...

20:32.439 --> 20:33.482
[laughter]

20:33.565 --> 20:35.525
coming out from behind my eye.

20:35.609 --> 20:39.905
Because he then gave me
the international verbal sign for,

20:39.988 --> 20:44.409
"I respect you and fear you,
I'm going to back off," which is...

20:45.327 --> 20:48.038
"A'ight, then." And he just walked away.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.333
[laughter and applause]

20:51.416 --> 20:54.294
[cheering]

20:56.129 --> 20:58.966
I never found my lip liner.
It was, like, in my other bag.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.134
[laughter]

21:01.218 --> 21:03.262
I didn't like that experience.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.138
I didn't like being on the floor.

21:05.222 --> 21:08.058
And I didn't like being on the floor
for a very specific reason.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.477
As a woman, I didn't need a reminder

21:10.560 --> 21:14.815
of how vulnerable women are
on a day-to-day basis.

21:14.898 --> 21:17.276
Being on the floor,
it's a very vulnerable place.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.527
I didn't need that reminder.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.071
And women in our society are vulnerable

21:21.154 --> 21:25.742
by virtue of the fact that we are
physically not as strong as men.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.787
That's the root of the issue,
that's the root of the oppression.

21:28.870 --> 21:32.291
And that's the root of oppression
of any side of war throughout history.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.918
One side was stronger,
they get to make the rules.

21:35.002 --> 21:38.463
Do you think for a second that
if women were physically stronger than men

21:38.547 --> 21:41.591
we would've waited for the right to vote?

21:41.675 --> 21:45.429
[cheering]

21:45.512 --> 21:48.098
[applause]

21:48.181 --> 21:53.228
It's 1910, some jacked-up housewife
is just putting up weight in her garage.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.773
She's got a shaker
of horse testosterone and creatine.

21:57.566 --> 22:01.069
Her little husband comes in,
he's like, "You're not voting."

22:01.153 --> 22:02.863
She'd be like...

22:02.946 --> 22:05.157
"Out of the way, Jedediah."

22:05.240 --> 22:07.784
[laughter]

22:07.868 --> 22:11.621
[cheering]

22:17.419 --> 22:20.005
"Mama's going to the polls."

22:20.088 --> 22:22.090
[laughter]

22:22.174 --> 22:24.718
It's physical strength,
that's the root of the issue.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.345
Physical strength.
And they try to placate women.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.514
They try to tell us
we're other types of strong.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.142
Sure. But none that matter
as much as physical strength.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.978
"Well, you're a woman,
so... mentally strong."

22:35.062 --> 22:36.563
[laughter]

22:36.646 --> 22:39.566
Mentally strong.
You put up with him all day, huh?"

22:39.649 --> 22:40.859
Pfft!

22:40.942 --> 22:43.779
[laughter]

22:43.862 --> 22:46.823
Mentally strong.
Mentally strong? What do I do with that?

22:46.907 --> 22:50.660
Mentally strong. What do I do
when a rapist runs at me? Math?

22:50.744 --> 22:53.622
[laughter]

22:56.333 --> 22:58.376
It's physical strength.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.755
Physical strength is what counts
when it comes to protecting yourself

23:01.838 --> 23:06.134
and women are only naturally
physically super-human strong

23:06.218 --> 23:07.469
when it comes to two things.

23:07.552 --> 23:10.305
The first is a recent one,
and that's CrossFit, which...

23:10.388 --> 23:13.558
It's enough, by the way.
It's a cult. Okay?

23:13.642 --> 23:14.851
[cheering]

23:14.935 --> 23:17.145
It's insane. It goes...

23:17.896 --> 23:21.483
Scientology, CrossFit, people without
celiac disease that don't eat gluten.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.236
It's a cult, okay? It's enough.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.406
"I can deadlift 600 pounds." Cool.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.491
What Starbucks do you work at?
What are you...

23:29.574 --> 23:31.326
Guard a village. Join up.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.579
What are you doing with that muscle,
all the horse meat?

23:35.664 --> 23:39.417
The workouts that they're doing,
it's all snake oil, I believe, okay?

23:39.501 --> 23:43.713
Push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups,
the foundations of a military workout,

23:43.797 --> 23:45.924
these are applicable
in the rest of your life.

23:46.007 --> 23:51.054
Instead, they've got a father of six
at 7 a.m. flipping a monster truck tire?

23:51.138 --> 23:53.849
Why? When do you need that?

23:53.932 --> 23:55.684
When do you need
to know the form for that?

23:55.767 --> 23:59.062
What post-apocalyptic
gorilla playground...

23:59.146 --> 24:00.355
[laughter]

24:00.439 --> 24:01.940
are you gonna find yourself in?

24:02.023 --> 24:05.777
Why don't we give you an empty suitcase
to throw around your cage, Peaches?

24:05.861 --> 24:08.989
[laughter and applause]

24:09.072 --> 24:13.702
And the rope thing. There are other ways
to build up your pectoral muscles.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.163
Men have been doing it for centuries.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.291
Instead they've got you using a rope.
When are you gonna use that?

24:19.416 --> 24:23.336
"Timmy's stuck down by the dock
under some boat rope!" "I got it!"

24:23.420 --> 24:25.255
[laughter]

24:25.338 --> 24:27.924
[cheering and applause]

24:31.219 --> 24:36.683
And the only time that women are
naturally, exceptionally physically strong

24:36.766 --> 24:39.936
is when it comes to childbirth.
And that's amazing.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.438
-[cheering]
-Yes.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.567
It'd be amazing if those were all men
with, like, really high-pitched voices.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.278
[laughter]

24:48.987 --> 24:51.531
It's an amazing amount
of super-human strength

24:51.615 --> 24:55.785
that unfairly women only get to tap into
when they're having a baby.

24:55.869 --> 24:59.956
You only get to tap into that super-human
strength once, maybe twice a year,

25:00.040 --> 25:03.668
but that second baby's gonna be very tiny.
You only get to use it then.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.795
That's a disproportionate
amount of strength.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.797
Mother Nature is playing
a cruel joke on us.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.593
Do you know how many pounds of pressure
per square snootch inch it takes

25:11.676 --> 25:13.887
to deliver a baby?

25:13.970 --> 25:15.472
[laughter]

25:15.555 --> 25:17.474
We're not even using our hands!

25:17.557 --> 25:20.477
You're like python-like digesting a goat.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.645
[laughter]

25:21.728 --> 25:22.979
"Get out of there!"

25:23.063 --> 25:27.442
Using fucking grit and rage and, like,
a mother's love, but just, "Aghh!"

25:27.525 --> 25:28.902
[laughter]

25:28.985 --> 25:31.529
Sparta! Just fucking going.

25:31.613 --> 25:32.822
[laughter]

25:32.906 --> 25:34.699
You can do that with your body,

25:34.783 --> 25:38.453
yet the rest of the year, we have trouble
not doing push-ups on our knees.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.205
That doesn't seem fair.

25:40.288 --> 25:42.082
[laughter]

25:43.333 --> 25:45.794
We're only exceptionally strong
when it comes to children.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.004
We have something called
mama bear strength.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.174
So that means when your child
is in danger, your child,

25:51.258 --> 25:53.760
someone else's child, "Sorry, junior."
Your child...

25:53.843 --> 25:55.136
[laughter]

25:55.220 --> 25:57.973
"Lift the piano off your legs yourself,
okay, I'm not your mama."

25:58.056 --> 26:02.310
When your child is in danger,
in that moment, through adrenaline,

26:02.394 --> 26:04.854
you can develop super-human strength
and save the baby.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.565
So if your child is trapped under a car,

26:07.649 --> 26:11.111
you can go ahead and flip that Buick
like an orangutan, no problem.

26:11.194 --> 26:12.195
[laughter]

26:12.279 --> 26:15.573
Yet if you're a single girl
walking alone on a Saturday night

26:15.657 --> 26:18.368
and some maniac runs at you,
what's your defense?

26:18.451 --> 26:20.412
Like, "No, two plus two is four."

26:20.495 --> 26:22.956
[laughter]

26:25.625 --> 26:28.628
We're millennials,
we'd probably use our phone calculators.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.338
[laughter]

26:30.422 --> 26:33.466
That's why sexual harassment
is such a big deal.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.845
It really has less to do
with the disgusting thing

26:36.928 --> 26:39.055
a man feels he has the right
to yell at you

26:39.139 --> 26:42.267
out of van or a truck.
Never out of a Civic for some reason.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.518
[cheering]

26:43.601 --> 26:47.355
But for the girls that might not know,
you can wear whatever you want.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.358
It doesn't give someone the right
to treat you like an animal.

26:50.442 --> 26:54.946
[cheering and applause]

26:55.030 --> 26:57.699
You can wear whatever you want.
You can leave the house out naked.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.493
You will go to jail,
but you can do whatever you want.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.538
But it has less to do with
what a man is yelling at you,

27:03.621 --> 27:05.498
and nobody wants to say this, but I will,

27:05.582 --> 27:08.293
what it has to do with
is the underlying notion

27:08.376 --> 27:11.171
that if that man wanted to act on it,
he could.

27:11.254 --> 27:13.882
And if you don't believe me,
every girl knows what it's like,

27:13.965 --> 27:17.761
a guy yells something disgusting at you,
and because you're strong, you yell back.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.888
He's like, "Nice tits."
You're like, "Fuck off!"

27:19.971 --> 27:23.767
Immediately followed by, "What if he
kills me?" Like, there's that moment.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.018
[laughter]

27:25.101 --> 27:27.729
Hoping to God
that your bark was big enough

27:27.812 --> 27:29.939
that you don't have to take a lady bite.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.443
Being sexually harassed is the worst.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.570
I'm sorry, let me rephrase that.

27:36.738 --> 27:40.325
Being sexually harassed by an ugly guy
is the worst.

27:40.408 --> 27:42.369
[laughter]

27:42.452 --> 27:45.413
[cheering and applause]

27:46.915 --> 27:49.167
If he's hot, it's just plain old flirting.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.835
[laughter]

27:51.211 --> 27:54.464
No one's ever been like, "Get away
from me, you model!" That's fine.

27:54.547 --> 27:55.882
[laughter]

27:55.965 --> 28:00.387
It has to do also with
an unrequited, uninvited sexual energy.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.097
And women are very aware of that.

28:02.180 --> 28:05.600
Every woman in here knows what it
feels like to have a guy's eyes on you

28:05.683 --> 28:08.144
when you find him attractive.
It's the best feeling.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.522
When you see hot guys and you walk by,
you're like,

28:10.605 --> 28:14.692
"Hope they're looking at my butt.
I feel so good about my little haunches."

28:14.776 --> 28:17.445
When the dudes are gross
and you walk by, you're like,

28:17.529 --> 28:20.698
"Please don't look at my butt,
please don't look at my butt."

28:21.866 --> 28:25.286
Having someone sexually harass you,
it's their energy on you.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.705
It feels like you're getting shot

28:26.788 --> 28:29.332
with a dick gun.
That's what it feels like.

28:29.416 --> 28:30.250
[laughter]

28:30.333 --> 28:31.751
Minding your own business, like,

28:31.835 --> 28:34.421
"I love being an independent woman."
"Nice tits!"

28:34.504 --> 28:35.713
"Agh!"

28:35.797 --> 28:39.592
[laughter]

28:39.676 --> 28:42.887
[cheering and applause]

28:48.768 --> 28:50.979
Aw, he got a boner for free.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.314
[laughter]

28:53.398 --> 28:56.526
Women have to think about these things.
It's hard being a girl.

28:56.609 --> 28:59.529
I haven't been a guy in, like, a while,
but it is difficult.

28:59.612 --> 29:00.739
[laughter]

29:00.822 --> 29:03.074
And we're constantly questioning ourselves

29:03.575 --> 29:07.162
and we're constantly being told that what
we feel is wrong and how we look is wrong.

29:07.245 --> 29:10.081
And we tell it to little girls
and it sticks with us.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.000
Take a man and a woman shopping.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.753
Nothing will fit
because fashion is the enemy, for sure.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.505
But nothing will fit the woman
for negative reasons

29:17.589 --> 29:20.425
and nothing will fit the guy
for positive reasons.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.510
Take a woman shopping,
"Nothing fits,

29:22.594 --> 29:25.472
my arms are fat, my thighs are big,
I'm fucking gross, I hate my body."

29:25.555 --> 29:28.516
Take a guy shopping,
an average man of average build,

29:28.600 --> 29:30.935
five-ten, 170,

29:31.019 --> 29:35.148
"Nah, I can't buy off the rack because
my shoulders are so abnormally broad.

29:35.857 --> 29:39.861
I'm tall. For my height, my waist tapers
at such an Adonis-like angle."

29:39.944 --> 29:41.112
[laughter]

29:41.196 --> 29:43.948
My dick is so girthy,
I can only wear JNCOs."

29:44.032 --> 29:45.033
[laughter]

29:45.116 --> 29:46.743
"It's hard for me."

29:46.826 --> 29:48.453
[applause]

29:48.536 --> 29:50.580
These are good things.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.958
Women are told to change.
It's okay if men are the same.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.335
That's why we have stereotypes.

29:55.418 --> 29:57.754
That's why you've got
the stereotype of your Grandpa,

29:57.837 --> 30:00.840
"I sit in my chair, I drink my beer,
I've got the remote,

30:00.924 --> 30:03.426
I fought in Korea,
don't fucking talk to me," right?

30:03.510 --> 30:05.136
"I'm not moving, you move!"

30:05.220 --> 30:07.847
Women aren't like that, right?
What do women do?

30:07.931 --> 30:10.016
-"I'm taking a class."
-[laughter]

30:10.099 --> 30:12.477
-Love classes.
-[laughter]

30:12.560 --> 30:15.313
-"I'm learning more about Cheryl."
-[laughter]

30:15.855 --> 30:18.775
-"I'm meeting Cindy for the first time."
-[laughter]

30:18.858 --> 30:22.403
There's two women in this monologue.
I'm two different women, it's fine.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.864
"I'm learning to breathe.
I'm getting a sense of myself.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.199
I'm canning.

30:26.282 --> 30:28.117
I'm canning my own beets."

30:28.201 --> 30:29.536
[laughter]

30:29.619 --> 30:31.412
For no reason.
I live in the middle of a city.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.456
I just thought I wanted to connect.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.835
I'm canning my own shit now.
I take it, put it in there,

30:36.918 --> 30:40.255
I let it solidify, I make jewelry,
I sell it on Etsy.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.464
It's nice pocket money."

30:41.548 --> 30:44.259
[laughter]

30:44.342 --> 30:47.470
"I'm learning about myself.
I'm learning to breathe.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.515
-I'm cutting my own hair."
-[laughter]

30:50.598 --> 30:53.560
"I'm learning to make my own tea,
putting the hair in the tea,

30:53.643 --> 30:54.561
I drink my hair."

30:54.644 --> 30:56.271
[laughter]

30:56.354 --> 30:57.188
Changing.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.274
We always wanna change
a little bit, right?

30:59.357 --> 31:03.027
Always wanna lose a little bit of weight.
No matter what your body looks like.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.905
-"I just wanna lose, like, five pounds."
-[laughter]

31:05.989 --> 31:08.533
We think that's the answer.
"Just wanna lose, like, five pounds."

31:09.325 --> 31:11.035
[gabbles]

31:11.119 --> 31:12.287
[laughter]

31:12.370 --> 31:14.998
"Just wanna lose, like,
five pounds before lunch."

31:15.081 --> 31:17.584
[laughter]

31:17.667 --> 31:19.586
"So I can have more lunch."

31:19.669 --> 31:23.047
[laughter and cheering]

31:23.131 --> 31:25.383
[applause]

31:27.635 --> 31:30.138
Because we think being skinny
is the answer, right?

31:30.221 --> 31:33.808
It's not even enough to be skinny, is it?
It's not even enough to be thin, is it?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.853
You have to be the thinnest
out of your friends,

31:36.936 --> 31:39.397
-who you hate.
-[laughter]

31:39.480 --> 31:43.151
You don't believe me? Look at any
Instagram picture of more than four women.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.153
It's a fucking pose-off.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.279
[laughter]

31:46.362 --> 31:50.325
Dudes don't care. They'll turn
around like gorillas mid-meal. [grunts]

31:50.950 --> 31:53.161
"Take the picture, I don't care.
Fucking..."

31:53.244 --> 31:56.164
[laughter]

31:56.247 --> 32:00.585
Girls, it's like a Mr. Universe, like,
"Fucking line up! Line up!

32:00.668 --> 32:03.421
Make it pointy! Concave!
Make it fucking pointy!

32:03.504 --> 32:04.505
Kisses.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.549
Neck vein.
Look at the motherfucking neck vein.

32:06.633 --> 32:07.467
Hamstring.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.385
Happy birthday, Stacey."

32:09.469 --> 32:12.388
[laughter]

32:12.472 --> 32:16.059
[cheering and applause]

32:19.604 --> 32:21.856
It's not enough to just be thin, right?

32:22.607 --> 32:25.944
You wanna be the kind of thin
where your friends...

32:27.612 --> 32:29.197
are worried for you.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.491
[laughter]

32:32.992 --> 32:35.203
[laughter]

32:39.332 --> 32:41.501
[laughter]

32:42.919 --> 32:45.838
[laughter and applause]

32:46.923 --> 32:49.634
So thin. Horrible looking.

32:49.717 --> 32:54.639
Stalking around Gap Kids.
"I wear a youth large, thank you." Right?

32:54.722 --> 32:57.850
-Fucking femur for days.
-[laughter]

32:57.934 --> 33:01.479
Right? Mr. Peanut Legs
coming out six seconds ahead of you.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.941
Like an R. Crumb comic book thinner,
right?

33:05.024 --> 33:08.361
Just walking around,
baby stegosaurus spine.

33:09.195 --> 33:11.781
Clothes hanging like moss
off a willow tree.

33:11.864 --> 33:14.701
A fucking clavicle
you can serve soup out of.

33:15.284 --> 33:16.911
Yeah!

33:17.912 --> 33:19.455
So happy!

33:19.539 --> 33:22.250
[laughter]

33:22.333 --> 33:24.252
I like my body, but I always...

33:24.335 --> 33:27.797
Everybody wants to change something,
right? I just wanted have shoulders

33:27.880 --> 33:31.843
that were so frail and tiny,
little bird shoulders.

33:31.926 --> 33:34.178
Do they even have shoulders?
No, it's just...

33:34.929 --> 33:37.890
That's what I want, I want no shoulders.
I want the kind of shoulders

33:37.974 --> 33:40.184
where my bra strap just falls down.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.979
-[mumbles weakly]
-[laughter]

33:43.062 --> 33:45.064
Just floppy hair. "Ohh. Whoops."

33:45.148 --> 33:47.066
[laughter]

33:47.150 --> 33:48.359
[mumbles weakly]

33:48.693 --> 33:51.320
Men love it. They love it. They go crazy.
One strap...

33:51.404 --> 33:53.573
Because it's one less thing
they gotta do, right?

33:53.656 --> 33:56.451
-[grunts]
-[laughter]

33:56.534 --> 33:58.745
It's not my fault
I think that's attractive.

33:58.828 --> 34:02.582
You see it on lingerie ads in magazines.
The women are on the bed, bra strap.

34:02.665 --> 34:05.835
Men love vulnerability
and that's what that represents.

34:05.918 --> 34:08.920
"Not me, I like a strong woman."
Bullshit. Vulnerability.

34:09.005 --> 34:12.550
"Help me. Open this jar. Please help me."
They love it.

34:12.632 --> 34:15.094
[laughter and applause]

34:16.554 --> 34:18.556
What does the bra strap down represent?

34:18.639 --> 34:22.643
You're not supported. When your tits are
flopping around, you can't run away. Yeah!

34:22.726 --> 34:24.978
[laughter]

34:26.773 --> 34:28.274
I want that.

34:28.357 --> 34:31.527
I want that bone structure, right?
I wanna have those shoulders.

34:31.610 --> 34:35.531
I wanna look like the girl on the cover
of the playbill for  Les Mis.  Just...

34:35.614 --> 34:38.326
[laughter]

34:38.409 --> 34:40.286
"Oh,  monsieur!"

34:40.369 --> 34:41.913
[laughter]

34:41.996 --> 34:44.956
It's a ten-year-old French girl.
Still, I want those bones.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.042
[laughter]

34:46.125 --> 34:50.713
They do, men love vulnerability, right?
That's why the thin thing is the thing.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.672
That's why women are expected to be...

34:52.757 --> 34:56.803
You can't have a baby if you're this big.
That's why we have to be... garden party.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.721
Like that kind of thin.

34:58.805 --> 35:01.349
Because if women are thin,
there's no nutrition,

35:01.432 --> 35:05.269
so you're cold, you don't leave the house,
you don't vote. Yeah!

35:05.353 --> 35:07.897
[laughter]

35:07.980 --> 35:12.401
[cheering and applause]

35:12.485 --> 35:14.987
That's why every model
has that vulnerable look.

35:15.071 --> 35:19.450
That's why models look like you uncovered
a refugee from under a manhole cover.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.078
"Ohhh! Gucci."

35:22.161 --> 35:24.997
[laughter and applause]

35:25.915 --> 35:29.418
They love vulnerability. And we do things
to make ourselves vulnerable.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.963
Strong women are told
to tone it down, right?

35:32.046 --> 35:35.299
But men are told to toughen up.
We don't let men be vulnerable.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.300
That's not fair.

35:36.384 --> 35:39.679
But I can't help you because I'm a girl
and I can only fight one fight at a time.

35:39.762 --> 35:42.014
[laughter]

35:42.098 --> 35:44.600
If you wanna come to my green room
and cry after, I will...

35:44.684 --> 35:46.185
laugh at you. But, no...

35:46.269 --> 35:47.270
[laughter]

35:47.353 --> 35:49.605
But we tell strong women
to bring it down, right?

35:49.689 --> 35:54.318
High heels? Why do you wear high heels?
So you what? Can't run from your attacker.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.444
Good.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.779
[laughter]

35:56.863 --> 35:58.030
Smoky eye makeup?

35:58.114 --> 35:59.866
Why does that make sense?
What are you doing?

35:59.949 --> 36:03.077
You take the makeup, grind it
into your eye. Why is that attractive?

36:03.161 --> 36:06.747
I figured it out. Smoky eye makeup
makes you look like you what?

36:06.831 --> 36:10.543
Just choked on a dick and cried. Good.

36:10.626 --> 36:12.670
[laughter]

36:12.753 --> 36:13.963
[cheering and applause]

36:14.046 --> 36:16.716
I am not wrong.
It's a little off-brand for me.

36:16.799 --> 36:17.717
I am not wrong.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.428
[laughter]

36:21.179 --> 36:23.347
It's not enough to be thin ever!

36:24.098 --> 36:26.726
You gotta be gaunt
to the point of extinction.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.854
The kind of thin where it's like,
"What up, bitches? Find me."

36:29.937 --> 36:31.230
That kind of thin.

36:31.314 --> 36:32.648
[laughter]

36:33.566 --> 36:36.027
Maybe I'm being unfair.
Maybe it's a cultural thing.

36:36.110 --> 36:39.071
I can only truly speak
from the perspective of what I am.

36:39.155 --> 36:42.116
I'm an upper-middle-class white woman.
Hope I die that way.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.034
[laughter]

36:43.117 --> 36:47.246
And the expectation of being thin
has been put on us for about 100 years.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.833
That's been the look. The like...
"Uhh, come, have some tea.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.753
Yes, these jeans are high.
That's not weird."

36:53.836 --> 36:56.547
We like that look.
And that's a hard look to achieve.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.008
Some women die trying to be thin.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.635
And it was only in the last...

37:00.718 --> 37:02.094
forty years

37:02.178 --> 37:06.682
that women of color and women
of other ethnicities rose to prominence

37:06.766 --> 37:10.144
and made it socially acceptable,
nay attractive,

37:10.228 --> 37:12.313
to have the body of a grown woman.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.106
Jennifer Lopez came out of nowhere

37:14.190 --> 37:16.484
with the backside
of a brontosaurus, like...

37:16.567 --> 37:18.402
[laughter]

37:18.486 --> 37:19.904
[cheering and applause]

37:19.987 --> 37:21.030
"Qué pasó?"

37:21.113 --> 37:23.241
[applause]

37:23.324 --> 37:25.076
And it became attractive.

37:25.159 --> 37:29.247
And somewhere, with everybody having
an agenda in our social conversation,

37:29.330 --> 37:31.999
it became okay to tell white girls
to their faces,

37:32.083 --> 37:33.709
"You're fat. Kill yourself."

37:33.793 --> 37:35.544
Bullying us on Facebook.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.338
Because you're white,
so life must be easy.

37:37.421 --> 37:40.174
Which, I'm not gonna lie, it's great.
Being white is great. But...

37:40.258 --> 37:41.342
[laughter]

37:41.425 --> 37:44.804
It became okay to say that
because we are not spicy, right?

37:44.887 --> 37:48.349
White women don't have a fire in them.
There's not a chili pepper here.

37:48.432 --> 37:51.352
Inside here is a scoop
of Breyer's vanilla bean ice cream.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.354
[laughter]

37:54.647 --> 37:57.817
And we'll take it.
Your boyfriend tells you you're fat,

37:57.900 --> 38:00.903
we'll be like, "I'm sorry, Chad,
please don't get out of the kayak."

38:00.987 --> 38:03.698
[laughter]

38:03.781 --> 38:06.284
"We're gonna have an afternoon.
I brought Jenga."

38:06.367 --> 38:08.494
[laughter]

38:08.577 --> 38:12.248
You know who has an unshakeable sense
of self-esteem? Black women.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.332
[cheering]

38:13.416 --> 38:14.834
You... Yes!

38:14.917 --> 38:19.130
You cannot tell a sister on her something
isn't working. She won't believe it.

38:19.213 --> 38:20.423
[laughter]

38:20.506 --> 38:23.050
Try it. Say to a black girl,
"I don't like those jeans."

38:23.134 --> 38:25.177
First of all, I dare you.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.096
[laughter]

38:27.179 --> 38:31.142
[cheering and applause]

38:31.225 --> 38:34.895
It will not rattle her for a second.
Be like, "I don't like those jeans."

38:34.979 --> 38:37.315
She'll be like,
"Bullshit. I see you looking."

38:37.398 --> 38:39.317
[laughter]

38:39.400 --> 38:42.278
[cheering and applause]

38:43.279 --> 38:47.575
Girls, if you want respect,
you're gonna have to take it.

38:47.658 --> 38:48.993
It's 2016.

38:49.452 --> 38:52.955
Let's learn math, let's learn science,
let's drop the body issues, okay?

38:53.039 --> 38:56.876
Don't let anybody make you feel less than.
Your bodies are perfect as they are.

38:56.959 --> 39:00.338
[cheering and applause]

39:00.421 --> 39:02.631
And if you want respect,

39:02.715 --> 39:05.843
you have to command respect,
not demand it.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.345
Two totally different things.

39:07.428 --> 39:09.388
Commanding respect is in the actions,

39:09.472 --> 39:11.599
it's the way
that we speak about each other,

39:11.682 --> 39:13.768
it's the way that you speak
about yourself.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.228
If your whole agenda is to be sexual,

39:16.312 --> 39:18.522
and confusing being sexual
with empowerment,

39:18.606 --> 39:20.816
and talking about fucking and sex
all the time,

39:20.900 --> 39:24.779
thinking that that's the reason that women
are empowered, you're fucking wrong.

39:24.862 --> 39:26.697
It comes with the way you treat yourself.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.282
Don't call each other whores.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.534
Don't call each other sluts.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.661
[cheering and applause]

39:33.621 --> 39:36.540
Because when you do that,
society looks at you and they say,

39:36.624 --> 39:38.584
"Oh, it's okay to talk to women that way."

39:38.667 --> 39:40.461
You teach people how to treat you.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.421
Let's get rid of the phrase
"walk of shame."

39:42.505 --> 39:44.757
What is that one? What is walk of shame?

39:45.716 --> 39:48.969
I don't understand that.
I've never had a walk of shame.

39:49.553 --> 39:51.263
What could that be?

39:51.347 --> 39:54.350
Walk of shame.
What's there to be shameful about?

39:54.850 --> 39:59.688
What's the shame in the fact that he and I
went out, we had the same amount of vodka,

39:59.772 --> 40:01.816
he got too drunk to get it up,
so he passed out,

40:01.899 --> 40:05.486
then I used his credit card to buy $100
worth of Chinese and stole his golf clubs?

40:05.569 --> 40:08.572
[cheering and applause]

40:08.656 --> 40:10.658
Walk of shame!

40:10.741 --> 40:13.828
[applause]

40:15.704 --> 40:18.916
We're starting from behind here, girls,
we've gotta say smarter things.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.001
From now on... Let's make a pact.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.003
From now on,

40:24.130 --> 40:26.549
I don't wanna hear any more women

40:27.133 --> 40:31.053
talk about how they wanna be... mermaids.

40:31.137 --> 40:32.430
[laughter]

40:32.513 --> 40:33.889
Okay?

40:33.973 --> 40:36.142
-[cheering and applause]
-Okay?

40:37.435 --> 40:38.978
It's stupid.

40:39.937 --> 40:43.774
And I'm not trying to be a bitch, but
it's probably not gonna happen for you.

40:43.858 --> 40:44.900
[laughter]

40:44.984 --> 40:46.360
Okay?

40:46.444 --> 40:48.988
Literally,
you don't have the bone structure.

40:49.071 --> 40:50.156
[laughter]

40:50.239 --> 40:52.158
What worries me, I see it a lot

40:52.241 --> 40:54.243
and it's not from children,
it's grown women,

40:54.326 --> 40:57.830
like, "I don't wanna be adult any more.
I wanna be a mermaid."

40:57.913 --> 41:02.042
You... The amount of escapism
that's in that sentence!

41:02.126 --> 41:04.962
You wanna move to the woods,
you wanna make jam, fine.

41:05.045 --> 41:07.548
At least you're still paying taxes.
You wanna be a mermaid?

41:07.631 --> 41:10.551
That means all of your achievements
in life are gonna lead to you being

41:10.634 --> 41:13.846
a fictional fuck toy for a horny sailor.
That's what you want?

41:13.929 --> 41:17.308
That's what mermaids are! Read a book!

41:17.391 --> 41:19.685
[cheering and applause]

41:19.768 --> 41:21.437
Because I see it a lot.

41:21.520 --> 41:24.273
T-shirts, right? "I am a mermaid."

41:25.107 --> 41:26.901
"Yo soy mermaid."

41:26.984 --> 41:28.110
[laughter]

41:28.194 --> 41:30.070
"Je suis mermaid."

41:30.154 --> 41:31.697
[laughter]

41:32.281 --> 41:33.991
Let's discuss the logistics...

41:35.075 --> 41:36.952
of being a mermaid,

41:37.036 --> 41:39.246
so that you have the information.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.833
If and when
the job opportunity presents itself

41:42.917 --> 41:44.543
on LinkedIn...

41:44.627 --> 41:46.295
[laughter]

41:46.879 --> 41:49.465
you can make an informed decision,
okay?

41:49.798 --> 41:52.676
If you are a mermaid, you don't sleep.

41:52.927 --> 41:54.720
Girls are like, "Oh, my God,
I love sleeping."

41:54.803 --> 41:56.430
"None for you. Just swim."

41:56.514 --> 41:58.015
[laughter]

41:58.098 --> 41:59.850
It's chugging Mountain Dew Code Red.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.394
There are no beds,
but there is Mountain Dew Code Red.

42:02.478 --> 42:05.940
You're some white-trash jacked-up mermaid
just swimming, swimming.

42:06.023 --> 42:08.651
And by the way, you don't have fins.
Remember, you're half-human.

42:08.734 --> 42:12.154
So you've got arms. You've got
these thick-ass traps, just swimming.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.323
[pants heavily]

42:14.406 --> 42:16.575
You can't stop swimming,
because if you do,

42:16.659 --> 42:19.745
something will try to eat you,
fuck you or kill you, okay?

42:20.371 --> 42:22.831
It's not dissimilar to being a woman
in a downtown area.

42:22.915 --> 42:25.417
So just swimming, swimming.

42:25.501 --> 42:28.754
Now, you're swimming all day,
you're probably pretty hungry, right?

42:28.837 --> 42:31.757
How are you gonna catch food?
Remember, you're half-human.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.176
We don't have
animal-catching accoutrements,

42:34.260 --> 42:38.097
like claws and tentacles and lasers.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.890
We don't have those kind of things.

42:39.974 --> 42:43.227
We have big brains.
So I don't know what you're gonna do.

42:43.310 --> 42:45.271
Maybe talk a crab to death.

42:45.354 --> 42:47.565
Like, "Excuse me. Excuse me."

42:47.648 --> 42:49.441
[laughter]

42:49.525 --> 42:54.071
I was thinking of double majoring in
psychology and communications. Excuse me.

42:54.154 --> 42:56.323
Excuse me. Are you a cancer?"

42:56.740 --> 43:00.327
So now... you're hungry, you're tired,

43:00.411 --> 43:03.163
you're like, "I don't care
because I'm gonna lay on the beach

43:03.247 --> 43:04.081
like a mermaid."

43:04.164 --> 43:06.375
No, you won't.
Sailors are gonna try to fuck you

43:06.458 --> 43:09.878
and the Japanese will definitely
try to eat you just for funsies, okay?

43:09.962 --> 43:11.880
[laughter]

43:11.964 --> 43:17.219
You're swimming around like, "I don't care
because I'll have long, flowing hair."

43:17.303 --> 43:19.513
No, you won't. You ever go in the ocean?

43:19.597 --> 43:21.682
You guys aren't on an ocean,
you're on a lake.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.852
You're a lake mermaid?
What are you, half trout? Kill yourself.

43:24.935 --> 43:27.605
[laughter and applause]

43:27.688 --> 43:31.150
Ohh! Freshwater mermaid?

43:32.484 --> 43:35.237
[laughter]

43:37.948 --> 43:42.077
What if you got, like, the weird end of
the genetic pool and you were half turtle?

43:42.620 --> 43:44.246
No tail but just half...

43:45.039 --> 43:48.250
"Long flowing mermaid hair."
You're not gonna have that.

43:48.334 --> 43:50.586
You ever go in the water
when there's waves?

43:50.669 --> 43:52.212
You won't have long flowing hair.

43:52.296 --> 43:55.591
You're going to have one giant mer-dread.

43:55.674 --> 43:57.384
[laughter]

43:57.468 --> 44:00.346
And it's just gonna follow you.
It's just one big old mer-lock

44:00.429 --> 44:04.767
and it's getting caught on propellers,
it's getting caught on anchors.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.977
There's sea lice living in your mer-dread

44:07.061 --> 44:09.355
because that's a warm,
hospitable environment.

44:09.438 --> 44:11.565
Then there's fish
feeding off those sea lice.

44:11.649 --> 44:15.486
There's an entire sustainable maritime
ecosystem attached to your fucking head.

44:15.986 --> 44:18.530
You drag it around.
Sea lice are nipping at your scalp.

44:18.614 --> 44:21.617
You gotta get rid of it, right?
You're like, "I'll just cut it off."

44:21.700 --> 44:23.702
Ain't no scissors in the ocean, all right?

44:24.286 --> 44:26.080
I don't care
what the Little Mermaid told us

44:26.163 --> 44:29.208
because she was a liar and a hoarder.

44:29.291 --> 44:31.377
[laughter and applause]

44:31.460 --> 44:32.795
Hoarder!

44:33.420 --> 44:36.632
We let it go because she was pretty,
but she was super-gross.

44:36.715 --> 44:37.841
[laughter]

44:37.925 --> 44:40.469
♪ Look at this stuff, isn't it neat? ♪

44:40.552 --> 44:42.680
That's a used toothbrush.
Don't put it in your...

44:42.763 --> 44:45.265
[screams] Ohh! Ohh!

44:45.349 --> 44:47.518
[gags] Ohh!

44:47.601 --> 44:49.103
You're gonna get sick!

44:49.186 --> 44:50.145
[laughter]

44:50.562 --> 44:53.816
Still gotta get rid of that mer-dread
because it's a hazard, so what do you do?

44:53.899 --> 44:55.526
You have to get another fish to help you.

44:55.609 --> 44:58.737
You have to do what they do
in the animal kingdom. You must what?

44:58.821 --> 45:02.282
You must what? Who here took
marine biology? You have to what?

45:02.366 --> 45:06.870
Form a symbiotic relationship
with other marine life.

45:06.954 --> 45:09.623
-Good. And have that fish...
-[laughter]

45:09.707 --> 45:13.669
come in with his fish tooth
and just saw off your mer-dread, right?

45:13.752 --> 45:17.381
It's gonna be bad-looking. But now,
remember, you gotta pay that fish back.

45:17.464 --> 45:20.551
That's the nature of a symbiotic
relationship, you must reciprocate.

45:20.634 --> 45:24.054
How you gonna pay that fish back?
You ain't got no money, shell-tits.

45:24.138 --> 45:26.473
[laughter]

45:27.391 --> 45:29.977
I hate to say it,
but the only thing you have...

45:30.060 --> 45:31.270
is fish sex

45:31.353 --> 45:33.731
and I don't know if you have a vagina

45:33.814 --> 45:38.527
because I'm not an ichthyologist
and I don't know how fish work.

45:38.610 --> 45:42.322
I should've looked it up before the taping
but I'm just trying to tell you some jokes

45:42.406 --> 45:45.701
and I think I've done a pretty good job.
You know what fish do? They poop.

45:45.784 --> 45:47.536
You've got a fish butt.
So think about that.

45:47.619 --> 45:50.080
-So.
-[laughter]

45:50.164 --> 45:53.041
So now you're swimming around,
you're hungry, you're tired,

45:53.125 --> 45:56.170
you've got a fucked-up haircut,
you're like a little sore, you're like...

45:56.253 --> 45:57.463
[groans]

45:57.546 --> 46:00.132
"I don't care.
I'm gonna be a mermaid. I'm gonna swim.

46:00.215 --> 46:02.176
Because I will swim like a mermaid."

46:02.259 --> 46:07.139
Let's remember how mermaids allegedly,
because they are not real, swim.

46:07.723 --> 46:10.309
They swim... like dolphins.

46:10.392 --> 46:11.226
[laughter]

46:11.310 --> 46:14.313
Hey, ladies,
do you love ab day at the gym?

46:14.396 --> 46:16.356
Well, that's your fucking life, sister!

46:16.440 --> 46:18.025
[laughter]

46:18.108 --> 46:21.069
"37. 38." Just trying to get through.

46:21.153 --> 46:24.531
Your entire existence
is that of an R. Kelly backup dancer.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.408
[laughter]

46:26.492 --> 46:28.660
Just swimming through the nineties.

46:28.744 --> 46:30.579
[applause]

46:30.662 --> 46:32.206
So, you can be a mermaid

46:32.289 --> 46:35.542
or you can always get a job
in front of a used car dealership.

46:35.626 --> 46:38.629
[laughter]

46:38.712 --> 46:43.300
[cheering and applause]

46:45.886 --> 46:48.680
No mermaids.
We can do better. No mermaids.

46:48.764 --> 46:52.267
I worry for women. I worry for men.
I worry for our country.

46:52.351 --> 46:55.187
Is anybody else
really worried for our country?

46:55.270 --> 46:57.981
[cheering and applause]

46:59.233 --> 47:03.612
So I'm worried... And by the way,
I am very proud to be an American

47:03.695 --> 47:06.657
and I love my country very much
and I want the best for it.

47:06.740 --> 47:09.785
There's no joke, it's just a statement.
I love being an American.

47:09.868 --> 47:11.453
[cheering]

47:11.537 --> 47:13.372
What I'm scared for...

47:14.164 --> 47:17.042
What I'm scared about
aren't so much the nightmares

47:17.125 --> 47:21.004
clawing at our front and back doors,
both politically, foreign, domestic,

47:21.088 --> 47:22.839
economical, ecological, whatever.

47:22.923 --> 47:25.425
What I'm scared about
is the fact that, like,

47:25.509 --> 47:28.679
my generation
is supposed to be grown-up and mature now.

47:29.847 --> 47:33.100
I represent the millennials.
Perhaps you've seen our Instagram pages.

47:33.183 --> 47:34.476
[laughter and cheering]

47:34.601 --> 47:36.895
Yeah, we cheer for ourselves.
We're the worst.

47:36.979 --> 47:39.606
[laughter]

47:39.690 --> 47:42.818
I will say this as the Lorax
of my generation, mustache,

47:42.901 --> 47:46.572
we... didn't ask to be spoiled.

47:46.655 --> 47:49.032
Our parents loved us
and they gave us everything.

47:49.116 --> 47:51.159
That's the job of the generation prior,

47:51.243 --> 47:54.079
to give the next generation
a better world than they had.

47:54.162 --> 47:58.792
So I'm gonna apologize to my grandkids for
the radioactive ball of foil and Diet Coke

47:58.875 --> 48:01.878
that they're gonna inherit from us.

48:01.962 --> 48:04.715
But that's what the people before you do.

48:04.798 --> 48:08.427
And I believe that this wave of
entitlement started with our grandparents.

48:08.510 --> 48:10.888
Our grandparents were called
the greatest generation,

48:10.971 --> 48:12.306
and I believe that they were.

48:12.389 --> 48:14.933
They selflessly gave
and they made this country

48:15.017 --> 48:17.477
the idea of America that a lot of us miss.

48:17.561 --> 48:20.355
White people. The rest of us,
it was horrible for most of them.

48:20.439 --> 48:21.773
-But in general...
-[laughter]

48:21.857 --> 48:23.525
The main points of it, okay?

48:23.609 --> 48:26.320
Your grandparents had to fight.
They had no choice.

48:26.403 --> 48:28.947
Grandpa had to fight in World War II.

48:29.031 --> 48:32.409
Grandpa was straight-up drizafted, okay?
He had no choice.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.661
And when he came home from the war,

48:34.745 --> 48:37.998
all he wanted to do was have a family,
have a job, be a little racist

48:38.081 --> 48:40.667
-and live the American dream, that's it.
-[laughter]

48:40.751 --> 48:44.129
He fought, he got right to work.
It's not like guys today who'd be like,

48:44.212 --> 48:47.549
"Oh, I just wanna backpack around Oregon
and find myself." No!

48:47.633 --> 48:49.176
[laughter]

48:49.259 --> 48:52.763
And they're allowed to say that
because, whether you like them or not,

48:52.846 --> 48:56.975
our military does such a good job
of defending us on a day-to-day basis.

48:57.059 --> 48:59.561
[cheering and applause]

48:59.645 --> 49:02.814
And I know that TSA blows.

49:04.232 --> 49:07.611
But they do such a good job
that you're allowed to mentally check out.

49:07.694 --> 49:10.322
Like, if you don't like
the war going on right now,

49:10.739 --> 49:12.199
unlike it on Facebook.

49:12.282 --> 49:13.450
[laughter]

49:13.533 --> 49:15.077
You're allowed to do that.

49:15.160 --> 49:17.537
There was no concerted effort.
You didn't have to fight.

49:17.621 --> 49:20.874
My point is, there was no day
we all gathered in our town squares

49:20.957 --> 49:24.795
and threw our iPhones into the center
so the military could use the scrap metal.

49:24.878 --> 49:27.589
"What's this? A droid? Take it back,
freak." We didn't have that.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.299
[laughter]

49:29.383 --> 49:33.470
I think it's difficult to conceive of a
world where you have to sacrifice so much

49:33.553 --> 49:36.723
and to understand what our grandparents
did because now they're old,

49:37.224 --> 49:40.644
and when you think old, what do you think?
Cute, right?

49:40.727 --> 49:43.188
Your grandparents are cute because
they're tiny, shrinking.

49:43.271 --> 49:44.356
Pick them up, put them down,

49:44.439 --> 49:47.109
they don't like it, sprinkle water,
"Get it off me."

49:47.192 --> 49:48.026
[laughter]

49:48.110 --> 49:51.029
And the whiter you are,
the greater a chance there is

49:51.113 --> 49:55.701
that you've developed some weird
prerogative kitten-like nickname

49:55.784 --> 49:57.661
for your grandfather.

49:57.744 --> 50:01.665
Oh, it's not Grandpa anymore,
it's like, "This is my Nim-Nam."

50:01.748 --> 50:04.626
[laughter]

50:04.710 --> 50:07.212
"This is my Yippers."

50:08.171 --> 50:09.840
"This is my Pip-Pop."

50:09.923 --> 50:13.552
Pip-Pop doesn't give a fuck. He's like,
"I was a prisoner of war for six years,

50:13.635 --> 50:15.929
call my Pip-Pop, I've had worse."

50:16.012 --> 50:18.306
[laughter]

50:19.766 --> 50:22.144
"Oh, my God, you guys,
my Pip-Pop is so cute.

50:22.227 --> 50:24.271
Oh, my God, Pip-Pop,
he's so cute, you guys.

50:24.354 --> 50:27.774
Sometimes at Christmas,
when Pip-Pop falls asleep,

50:27.858 --> 50:30.110
we like to decorate him
with Christmas bows.

50:30.193 --> 50:32.237
Isn't that funny? Silly Pip-Pop."

50:32.320 --> 50:34.614
Pip-Pop's got 53 confirmed kills!

50:34.698 --> 50:36.742
[laughter]

50:36.825 --> 50:40.620
[cheering and applause]

50:45.333 --> 50:47.294
Don't think for a second

50:47.377 --> 50:51.298
Pip-Pop doesn't remember how to repurpose
that Christmas bow around your neck

50:51.381 --> 50:53.508
to get the intel that he needs out of you.

50:53.592 --> 50:56.553
"Sit the fuck down,
Colton, Caleb, Ashton, Crashton, Crandon,

50:56.636 --> 50:58.805
whatever your fucking hipster name is,
sit down!"

50:58.889 --> 51:00.640
[laughter and cheering]

51:00.724 --> 51:04.269
Pip-Pop came home from the war
and then they had our parents.

51:04.352 --> 51:09.483
Our parents are called the baby boomers
because Pip-Pop came home from Normandy

51:09.566 --> 51:14.446
and he was like, [gasps] "I'm not dead.
Boom, Gladys, let's fuck."

51:14.529 --> 51:16.072
And then...

51:16.156 --> 51:19.034
[laughter and applause]

51:19.117 --> 51:21.369
The baby boomers, ask your parents,

51:21.453 --> 51:24.998
were the first generation that were
allowed to be artists on a mass scale.

51:25.082 --> 51:28.335
You didn't have to work on your
family business, you could take drugs,

51:28.418 --> 51:31.838
rock 'n' roll, you could do and be
what you wanted to be in the big city.

51:31.922 --> 51:33.840
The baby boomers had generation X.

51:33.924 --> 51:35.884
I don't care about them
because I'm a millennial.

51:35.967 --> 51:39.971
We showed up, got a trophy for breathing
and then we invented Instagram.

51:40.055 --> 51:43.725
[cheering and applause]

51:45.519 --> 51:47.562
What's insane about Instagram is this.

51:47.646 --> 51:52.567
We use hashtags, right?
Hashtag, formerly known as the pound sign.

51:52.651 --> 51:53.902
[laughter]

51:53.985 --> 51:55.362
She got a makeover.

51:55.445 --> 51:58.949
What's weird about a hashtag... is this.

51:59.032 --> 52:03.495
The more hashtags there are
under a posted picture on Instagram,

52:03.578 --> 52:07.874
the less likely the last hashtag
is gonna have anything to do...

52:07.958 --> 52:08.959
[laughter]

52:09.042 --> 52:10.794
with that posted picture.

52:10.877 --> 52:13.630
You got more than four hashtags
under your picture,

52:13.713 --> 52:16.842
you are witnessing
a human thought process devolve.

52:16.925 --> 52:18.343
[laughter]

52:18.426 --> 52:22.138
By the end, it's just word association.
Free word association.

52:22.222 --> 52:25.100
Bunch of people on the beach,
Fourth of July, right?

52:25.183 --> 52:27.686
"Fuck, yeah! #FourthBitches

52:27.769 --> 52:30.147
#Fourth #BeachDay #BDay

52:30.230 --> 52:33.191
#IndependenceDay #IndependentWoman
#Beyonce" Yes!

52:33.275 --> 52:36.695
"#Blessed #IPayMyBills
#BikiniBody #BeachBody

52:36.778 --> 52:39.739
#BoutThatLife #DontNeedAMan
#DontWantAMan #NeverHadAMan

52:39.823 --> 52:42.701
#SometimesToFeelAHumanEmotion
ILikeToDrinkMyOwnHair"

52:42.784 --> 52:44.619
What? What? What?

52:44.703 --> 52:46.121
[cheering and applause]

52:46.204 --> 52:47.038
Say something.

52:48.957 --> 52:50.625
Talking about?

52:53.253 --> 52:55.338
And then, because we're so hard on women,

52:55.422 --> 52:58.717
we're mean to women when they're proud
of their bodies on Instagram.

52:58.800 --> 53:02.387
We only allow women to post pictures
when they're a work in progress, right?

53:02.470 --> 53:04.222
"Keep it going." If you're ever like,

53:04.306 --> 53:06.433
"This is as good as it gets,
fucking check it out!"

53:06.516 --> 53:09.019
it's like,
"You whore. You showy fucking bitch."

53:09.102 --> 53:13.106
So instead of empowering women
and letting them be proud of themselves,

53:13.189 --> 53:16.985
women have to shroud their pride
in misdirect hashtags.

53:17.068 --> 53:20.947
So you've got a generation of girls proud
of their bodies in a bathroom like this,

53:21.031 --> 53:24.743
and rather than be like,
"#CheckOutMyBodyImSoHappyWithMyself,"

53:24.826 --> 53:28.330
instead she's like,
"#CheckOutTheGroutWorkOnTheseTiles."

53:28.413 --> 53:29.748
[laughter]

53:29.831 --> 53:31.458
Who's looking at that?

53:33.251 --> 53:35.670
I broke up with my boyfriend
a couple of months ago.

53:35.754 --> 53:40.634
Let me ask you a question. Have you ever
dated someone who is... so pretty...

53:42.218 --> 53:43.887
but so stupid?

53:43.970 --> 53:47.098
[laughter and cheering]

53:47.182 --> 53:49.184
Notice, it's girls cheering.

53:49.267 --> 53:52.562
All the guys are like, "Yeah,
I brought her here. Keep it moving!"

53:52.646 --> 53:54.689
[laughter]

53:54.773 --> 53:56.566
"I don't wanna get in a fight!"

53:58.777 --> 54:02.447
So, men can do that. Women really can't.

54:03.490 --> 54:07.077
And the reasoning isn't because men
are dicks, there's nothing like that,

54:07.160 --> 54:09.329
it has to do
with the wiring of our brains.

54:09.412 --> 54:13.959
Men are visually stimulated, women,
unfortunately, are cerebrally stimulated.

54:14.042 --> 54:17.420
Men are visual creatures.
They have to be attracted to a woman

54:17.504 --> 54:20.966
before they can get to know how amazing
she is inside. They have to be...

54:21.049 --> 54:24.761
A dude will date a popsicle stick if
it's got a wig. Like, it doesn't matter.

54:24.844 --> 54:26.262
[laughter]

54:26.346 --> 54:29.432
That's why it's tough,
because you wanna be a feminist,

54:29.516 --> 54:31.226
like, "I don't have to get ready
for a man,"

54:31.309 --> 54:33.895
but that's what they're attracted to.
Just the littlest bit.

54:33.979 --> 54:37.107
Everybody's got that one girlfriend that's
like, "I don't get it. I volunteer

54:37.190 --> 54:40.527
and I rescue animals and I'm very sweet."
It's like, "Yeah, but you're so ugly

54:40.610 --> 54:43.613
so you have to... Just brush the hair!

54:43.697 --> 54:46.491
Just, anything! One tooth."

54:46.574 --> 54:48.952
[laughter]

54:49.035 --> 54:50.662
You don't have to have it out there.

54:50.745 --> 54:53.748
He cannot check out your personality
from across the room.

54:53.832 --> 54:54.833
That's all I'm saying.

54:54.916 --> 54:56.418
No man has ever done that.

54:56.501 --> 54:59.671
No man has ever seen a woman
who's sitting there nibbling on her nubs

54:59.754 --> 55:02.173
-with, like, a gill...
-[laughter]

55:02.257 --> 55:05.677
and walked up and been like, "Excuse me,
you're hideous, but you look like

55:05.760 --> 55:08.805
you might enjoy Tom Clancy,
light nipple play and barbecue.

55:08.888 --> 55:09.723
Is that true?"

55:09.806 --> 55:11.391
[laughter]

55:11.474 --> 55:14.769
[applause]

55:17.272 --> 55:20.275
And women do stuff to make themselves
physically attractive.

55:20.358 --> 55:22.193
Even if you're not trying that hard,

55:22.277 --> 55:24.654
most of the stuff we do
is just to get men's attention.

55:24.738 --> 55:27.490
Shiny hair. Why is your hair shiny?
It makes you look fertile.

55:27.574 --> 55:28.450
Thanks, Pantene.

55:28.533 --> 55:32.078
But that's why. There's no reason to have
it shiny other than to get attention.

55:32.162 --> 55:35.123
You're not, like, deflecting a car light
when you're running.

55:35.206 --> 55:39.085
Big eyes. "Look at me! My lips look like
a vagina and my boobs look like a butt

55:39.169 --> 55:42.422
and my butt looks like boobs.
I'm a Mrs. Potato Head. Mate with me!"

55:42.505 --> 55:44.424
[laughter]

55:45.133 --> 55:47.844
-You may not like it, but I'm not wrong.
-[laughter]

55:47.927 --> 55:50.138
Women are cerebrally stimulated.

55:50.221 --> 55:54.392
That's why we say the number one thing
we look for in a man is a conversation.

55:54.476 --> 55:57.687
"Someone I can talk to. Sense of humor."

55:58.480 --> 56:02.150
I have dated gutter goblins who were just,
like, really funny and smart.

56:02.776 --> 56:04.569
"I just wanna talk to him. It's sexy.

56:04.652 --> 56:07.697
I just want someone I can talk to.
At. Just sit there and breathe, Steve."

56:07.781 --> 56:11.284
We need that back and forth.
We have to be able to talk.

56:11.368 --> 56:14.788
And it's something that we need,
and yet we're chastised for it.

56:15.288 --> 56:17.207
You ever been called a "chatty Cathy"?

56:17.290 --> 56:19.709
By an idiot, but still,
ever been called that?

56:20.251 --> 56:23.755
"A couple of girls just yipping away, huh?
She'll talk your ear off.

56:23.838 --> 56:26.800
Bunch of giblets in a henhouse."
No-one says giblets in a hen...

56:26.883 --> 56:28.927
That means the chicken's already dead.

56:29.010 --> 56:30.595
[laughter]

56:30.678 --> 56:33.723
Women are always chastised
for talking a lot.

56:33.807 --> 56:36.726
The reason women talk
goes back thousands of years.

56:36.810 --> 56:40.480
The reason women talk a lot,
have a proclivity for speaking... Mm!

56:40.563 --> 56:44.776
is when men would go out and hunt
and fight and get animals,

56:44.859 --> 56:47.237
-otherwise known as hunting...
-[laughter]

56:47.320 --> 56:50.490
"Go get an animal."
Women stayed behind...

56:50.573 --> 56:52.242
[laughter]

56:52.325 --> 56:55.245
And we raised the kids
and we made food.

56:55.328 --> 56:57.664
And because the world
wasn't really a thing yet,

56:57.747 --> 56:59.958
we exchanged survival secrets.

57:00.041 --> 57:02.961
We would tell each other things like,
"Oh, don't eat that berry,

57:03.044 --> 57:05.588
it'll make your husband's dick fall off."

57:05.672 --> 57:07.257
"Don't wipe with that leaf,

57:07.340 --> 57:10.385
I found in my studies
that it really hurts your vagina."

57:10.468 --> 57:13.930
You had to exchange this information
to keep your tribe alive.

57:14.013 --> 57:16.391
Now, that's devolved to,
"What color lip gloss?"

57:16.474 --> 57:20.353
but it's the exchange of information.
Girls gather and then share.

57:20.437 --> 57:23.314
So guys,
when we're talking and it bothers you,

57:23.398 --> 57:26.317
just know we're trying to make it
so your dick doesn't fall off!

57:26.401 --> 57:27.819
That's what we're doing.

57:27.902 --> 57:29.821
Trying to help you!

57:29.904 --> 57:32.490
-Trying to help you live!
-[cheering and applause]

57:36.286 --> 57:40.206
Nothing wrong with it. I'll say it.
I'm a feminist. You know what?

57:40.290 --> 57:42.834
I'll say it for the women
that don't know to say it.

57:42.917 --> 57:44.919
And you might not be comfortable with it.

57:45.003 --> 57:48.548
Because a lot of women are like, "I love
being a woman, but I'm not a feminist."

57:48.631 --> 57:51.384
What are you, a horse?
Like, what are the other options?

57:52.177 --> 57:53.803
Let me clarify it...

57:53.887 --> 57:55.013
[cheering]

57:55.597 --> 57:57.974
for the men and the women
who might not have a clear idea.

57:58.057 --> 58:00.727
Being a feminist means
you just wanna be treated fairly,

58:00.810 --> 58:03.938
you just want it even, no more, no less.
Maybe like a little bit more.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.190
You just wanna get the same.

58:06.191 --> 58:08.276
And a lot of women
don't like to say they're feminists

58:08.359 --> 58:10.987
because they don't think
it sounds attractive, right?

58:11.070 --> 58:13.364
Which is inherently an issue
in and of itself.

58:13.448 --> 58:16.117
Because men think feminist,
they have a bad idea of it.

58:16.201 --> 58:19.913
Guys think of some square-jawed broad
with three chin hairs and a power suit,

58:19.996 --> 58:22.248
like, "I'm gonna kick you in the dick
and take your job!"

58:22.332 --> 58:23.875
That's not what we want.

58:23.958 --> 58:25.835
We just want it even.

58:25.919 --> 58:28.796
If we're gonna be feminists,
let's start with something fun.

58:28.880 --> 58:30.465
Wage gap, gotta close that.

58:30.548 --> 58:34.302
But let's start with something everybody
wants to deal with. Yeah, for sure. Duh!

58:34.385 --> 58:35.220
[cheering]

58:35.303 --> 58:37.096
Let's start with porn.

58:37.180 --> 58:40.266
[cheering]

58:40.350 --> 58:43.311
Because even if you're a woman
and you love being a porn star,

58:43.394 --> 58:46.147
it's still you taking it
for, like, three hours,

58:46.231 --> 58:49.234
you're getting paid 30 percent less
and he's actually getting off,

58:49.317 --> 58:51.903
so let's make some feminist porn.

58:51.986 --> 58:54.656
Let's see a porn
where a girl kicks a door in, like...

58:55.198 --> 58:58.076
"Who wants to lick it? Line up! Go!"

58:58.159 --> 59:00.161
[laughter and cheering]

59:00.245 --> 59:01.412
Go!

59:02.288 --> 59:03.623
Next! Go!

59:04.832 --> 59:06.751
Beat your best time. Go!"

59:06.834 --> 59:09.587
[laughter]

59:09.671 --> 59:12.340
-That's so gross.
-[laughter]

59:12.423 --> 59:13.967
So off-brand. So gross.

59:14.050 --> 59:17.720
Now, all the girls are cheering,
because in theory, that's empowering.

59:17.804 --> 59:19.681
But in practice, horrific.

59:19.764 --> 59:22.809
That would be horrible.
No woman could withstand that.

59:22.892 --> 59:26.229
Halfway through the second guy, we'd
all be like, "Okay, okay, okay, okay!"

59:26.312 --> 59:27.272
[laughter]

59:27.355 --> 59:29.190
"It's sensitive! I need a minute!"

59:29.274 --> 59:31.651
[laughter and applause]

59:31.734 --> 59:33.861
"I just need a minute!
I just need a minute.

59:34.279 --> 59:36.531
Don't hug me.
I'm not mad, I just need a minute."

59:36.614 --> 59:38.032
[laughter]

59:38.116 --> 59:41.411
"Why don't you go order us a pizza?
I'll fire up my Pinterest page."

59:41.494 --> 59:43.955
[laughter and cheering]

59:45.707 --> 59:48.334
Let me ask you a question.
This is for the girls in the audience.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.712
This is a very real question,
very real statement.

59:50.795 --> 59:52.338
Have you ever been...

59:52.422 --> 59:55.174
Have you ever been
having sex with your boyfriend

59:55.258 --> 59:58.553
and you're not into it, like, obviously,
and then all of a sudden,

59:58.636 --> 01:00:00.638
you start to get really excited?

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:03.308
Not so much from physical stimulation,

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.310
but because mentally you're like...

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:09.897
"This is almost done."

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:12.483
[cheering and applause]

01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:18.406
[laughter]

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:20.408
And when it is done... [gasps]

01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:24.495
we shall go to the farmers market!"

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.706
You plan out the whole day.

01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:31.377
Guys, you have to make sure
her head is in the game,

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:34.422
no pun intended,
but, like, pun intended for sure.

01:00:34.505 --> 01:00:38.343
I don't think we check in with each other
enough as opposite sexes.

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:42.347
Men think because she's making noises
they hear in movies, she's enjoying it.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:45.642
Women are like, "I'm making noises,
let's fucking get it over with."

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:49.729
If you care about the girl, you gotta
make sure she's getting what she wants.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:52.982
And girls, the best thing you can do,
if you have great sex,

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:55.735
the best thing you can do
the second sex is over

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:58.529
is... not talk to him.

01:00:58.613 --> 01:00:59.906
[laughter]

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:02.325
Sounds horrible.
It's actually to your benefit.

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:05.912
That's not your boyfriend
lying next to you.

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:08.873
That is a husk of a man...

01:01:08.956 --> 01:01:10.083
[laughter]

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:12.335
-depleted of all bodily fluids...
-[laughter]

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:17.382
incapable of giving you
the answer you deserve.

01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:20.677
And I get it. You just had sex,
you're feeling great, oxytocin is flowing,

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.346
you just hosted a human being
inside of you...

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:26.557
You love him
and you wanna talk about the future.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:28.226
He can't do it.

01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:32.271
You look at him and say, "What are you
thinking about?" He's laying there, dust.

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:35.441
[exhales heavily]

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.151
[laughter and applause]

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:39.153
"Ohh."

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:41.698
Get him a Gatorade, give him five.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:45.702
He can't answer you. You'll be like,
"What are you thinking about?"

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:50.289
He'll never, ever be like,
"You in a wedding dress."

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.500
[laughter]

01:01:54.627 --> 01:01:58.798
But guys, if you love your girl, check in
with her. Because you're far away.

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:00.675
She's up there. You're here like,

01:02:00.758 --> 01:02:03.428
"I'm amazing.
I'll bet she fucking loves this."

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:07.306
And we're down there like,
"I wonder if lavender is in season."

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.976
[laughter]

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:12.854
[applause]

01:02:12.937 --> 01:02:14.522
Still back there.

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:17.066
"Siri, is lavender..."

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.319
[laughter]

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.029
"Calling Mom Cell."

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:24.031
-"No, Siri!"
-[laughter]

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:25.950
"No!" Snap.

01:02:26.033 --> 01:02:27.535
[laughter]

01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:33.124
The moral of that story is
I was in a relationship

01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:35.710
and I wasn't happy,
so I left the relationship.

01:02:35.793 --> 01:02:38.421
I'm not advocating
for leaving the person you're with.

01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:41.340
What I am advocating for is this.
If you're not happy,

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:44.427
there's no reason to stay
out of fear of being alone.

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:46.554
We like to scare women.

01:02:46.637 --> 01:02:49.474
[cheering and applause]

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:51.726
And I'm sure there are men
that feel this way.

01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:55.730
But we like to scare women when they're
single and we like to be mean to them

01:02:55.813 --> 01:02:58.733
and we label them.
We say mean things to them.

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:01.277
She's a spinster. Old maid.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.696
Really involved with animal rescue.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.073
-We have names like that.
-[laughter]

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.826
And we like to question them,
as if there's something wrong.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:09.869
"Why are you single?"

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:12.455
"Because the last one was a dick
and I'm not stupid."

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:14.457
Like, that's why you do it.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.292
[cheering and applause]

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:18.252
Nobody wakes up married.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:20.630
Nobody is born betrothed to someone.

01:03:20.713 --> 01:03:23.674
We have to be kinder to women
and stop doing it.

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:26.177
And we have the audacity
to have magazines,

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.888
self-help books, articles,
posing the question,

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:32.266
"You're single. Now what?
You're single. Now what?"

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.893
What do you mean, "Now what?"

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.020
Now I shave off an eyebrow
and take up with wolves.

01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:38.856
What do you mean, "Now what?"
What do you mean, "Now what?"

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.026
I got a mortgage.
How about fuck bitches, get money?

01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.944
[cheering]

01:03:43.027 --> 01:03:44.737
It's so stupid.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.740
[cheering and applause]

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:58.709
What upsets me is that women
spend so much time and energy

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:02.338
flogging themselves mentally
for being single,

01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:05.591
and changing and trying different methods
and looking for guys.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.427
And men don't have to do that.
They have the luxury of relaxing

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:12.640
because they don't have eggs.
There are no articles in GQ like,

01:04:12.723 --> 01:04:15.309
"You're single. Now what?"
There's none of that.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:19.397
The answer would always be, "Now I can
jerk off where I want. No-one bugs me.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.898
#Sandwich."

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:24.193
[laughter and applause]

01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:30.575
The good part about traveling for
the last year, I've had time for myself.

01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:31.784
[laughter]

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.619
More time from my research.

01:04:34.495 --> 01:04:36.831
-I don't do research.
-[laughter]

01:04:36.914 --> 01:04:38.916
-I just watch TV.
-[laughter]

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.211
But I wear a lab coat while I do it
for the tax write-off.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.005
[laughter]

01:04:44.797 --> 01:04:48.134
Before we get out of here,
before we conclude this  TED Talk...

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:50.720
[laughter]

01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:53.222
Does everybody here watch  Shark Tank?

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:56.392
[cheering and applause]

01:04:56.475 --> 01:04:57.852
So...

01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:02.398
All I want, all I want,

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:04.984
is a live episode of  Shark Tank.

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:07.695
That's what I want. A live episode.

01:05:07.778 --> 01:05:09.363
It's a reality show.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:12.909
But if you watch it, you'll notice
it's heavily edited, heavily produced,

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:14.619
and what bothers me...

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:18.539
is the presentations from
the entrepreneurs are too polished.

01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:22.376
There's no grit to them. They come out
like a fifth-grade Thanksgiving pageant.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.295
"The natives called it maize.
We bottled it."

01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:26.297
I don't wanna see that, okay?

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.341
I want to see you mess up.

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:30.843
I wanna see you trip.
Maybe you forget your words.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:36.098
Maybe you chip a tooth. I wanna see you
crumble as an entity before my eyes.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:41.145
Only then will I tolerate you rising
from the ashes with any degree of hubris.

01:05:41.228 --> 01:05:43.856
That's the way to consume
American reality TV.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.485
The sheer  schadenfreude  of watching
someone shit themselves on TV

01:05:47.568 --> 01:05:50.947
and then building them back up.
That's what we like to see. Okay?

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.616
[cheering and applause]

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:57.078
These are cattle farmers
from the middle of Iowa

01:05:57.161 --> 01:06:00.623
and they get in front of a camera
and suddenly they're Winston Churchill?

01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:02.667
I don't buy it, okay?

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:05.378
I speak for a living and even I mess up,

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:08.547
so there's no way
these two fucking dye jobs from ASU

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.008
with, like, a new take on cookies,
there's no way!

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:12.134
[laughter]

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:14.136
Flawlessly orating.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.599
There are three archetypes of women
that they like to have on  Shark Tank.

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:22.103
They love to have moms,
because most of us have moms.

01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:24.855
[laughter]

01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:29.068
But what's crazy and, like, creepy

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:31.779
is that all the moms on  Shark Tank

01:06:31.862 --> 01:06:34.115
have the exact same voice.

01:06:34.198 --> 01:06:35.116
[laughter]

01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:36.867
It's a little Stepfordian.

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:39.453
They all sound like this.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:42.331
[in perky voice] "Hi, Sharks.
My name's Nancy from Laguna Niguel

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:46.002
and I've discovered a new way to get
your toddler to eat their blueberries."

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.253
[jabbers]

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:50.589
[laughter and cheering]

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:53.551
[cheering and applause]

01:06:53.634 --> 01:06:57.555
Then they have really smart women.
They do. They'll have brilliant women.

01:06:57.638 --> 01:07:00.891
But it seems that the smarter the woman,
the longer the last name.

01:07:00.975 --> 01:07:03.019
Like, they'll hyphenate their last names.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:04.979
I can't stand hyphenated last names.

01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:08.441
If you're in this room and you've got
a hyphenated last name, chop it in half!

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:09.525
[laughter]

01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:12.111
Okay? You're not Spanish royalty. Chop it!

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:13.195
[laughter]

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.281
I barely care about your first name.

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:16.949
[laughter]

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.410
Let alone
the entire questionable heritage.

01:07:19.493 --> 01:07:21.954
When you have a hyphenated last name,

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:25.374
all that makes me think is that
mama was a big old strong lesbian

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:27.543
and she didn't wanna
give up her family inheritance

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:31.088
so she begrudgingly married your father,
now they have separate twin beds

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:34.008
and are co-women's studies professors
at Wellesley.

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:36.844
[laughter and applause]

01:07:36.927 --> 01:07:38.846
It's also just so much information.

01:07:38.929 --> 01:07:42.391
I'm trying to hear you,
your valuation, listen to the equity,

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:45.019
and you're coming up there
with a phonebook, like, "Hi, Sharks.

01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:47.563
My name's
Michelle-Lida-Julia Freeman-Cereal."

01:07:47.646 --> 01:07:49.857
"And I'm Rebecca-Lynn-Stacey
Fitzgerald-Yang.

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.234
And together, we sound like five dudes."

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:55.529
Like, it's a lot... of information.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:58.574
Are you inventors or a law firm?
Like, what is that?

01:07:58.657 --> 01:07:59.992
[laughter]

01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:02.036
And then in the final category,

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:04.789
the toy category, we have the hot women.

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:08.125
Not attractive. Not cute.

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:11.212
Fucking hot. Teeth, tan, tits, hair.
"Sharks!"

01:08:11.295 --> 01:08:13.631
[laughter]

01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:16.841
Sometimes they do this.
They'll have very smart woman on the show.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:21.721
Sometimes it feels like the hotter
the woman, the dumber the product.

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:24.265
And I believe it's done
to keep us in line.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:28.979
But... a lot of the time, the women's
products have to do with two categories.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:31.398
It's either wrangling your femininity.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:35.277
"Sharks, it's a flap you put
over your vagina

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:36.694
so no one knows you have one."

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:40.407
[laughter]

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:42.660
"Move through the workplace with ease."

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:43.911
[laughter]

01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:48.499
Or it's a product so stupid,
it will just confirm

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:52.252
any preconceived notions you might have
about female intelligence.

01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:56.506
Like, "Sharks, it's a shower cap
that you can wear while you're cooking

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:58.634
so your hair doesn't smell!"

01:08:58.716 --> 01:09:00.386
[imitates gun firing] No!

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.513
[laughter]

01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:06.267
[applause]

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:09.520
You just set us back, like, a week
with that shit, Lexi.

01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:10.979
[laughter]

01:09:11.063 --> 01:09:13.107
But that's the one
that I'd like to see live.

01:09:13.607 --> 01:09:14.899
The hot one.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:18.112
Because I believe
watching an attractive woman

01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:19.863
mentally unravel...

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:20.781
[laughter]

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:25.243
on national television
is the reason we all watch reality TV.

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:26.828
[laughter]

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.999
"Up next are two sisters
from Scottsdale, Arizona,

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.751
with a new take on popcorn."

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:35.421
[sings Shark Tank music]

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:38.006
[laughter]

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:43.179
[sings Shark Tank music]

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:45.389
Jiggle, jiggle.

01:09:45.471 --> 01:09:47.224
[laughter]

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:51.770
"Hi, Sharks! My name's Madison."

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.189
Duh. They're always named Madison, right?

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:56.567
"And this is my sister, Michaela."

01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:58.903
They're always named Michaela.
Fucking obviously.

01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:03.199
"And together,
we are the inventors, creators

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:05.159
and CEOs of...

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:09.330
[whispers] Put your back against mine."

01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:11.832
[laughter]

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.177
"CEOs of...

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.055
[whispers] Put your fucking back
against mine.

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:29.683
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

01:10:30.684 --> 01:10:32.770
We do this then we do the product, yes?

01:10:32.853 --> 01:10:36.148
Oh, my fucking goodness!
We haven't done the product yet.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.025
We can't. We can't start over.

01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:40.986
That's what that light is.
That's fucking live, bitch. Yes!"

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.112
[laughter]

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.156
"We can't... Can we start over?"
"No."

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.115
"I got nothing."

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.409
[laughter]

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.495
"Oh, my God, I'm not yelling at you!

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:52.456
I'm not yelling at you.
I'm not making it about me!

01:10:52.539 --> 01:10:55.668
Do not do this here! It's fucking live TV!
I'm not making it about me!

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:59.255
You're making it about me
making it about you making it about me!

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:01.340
I am trying to make this... Oh, my God.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:04.551
Okay. Just stay there. I will do it.
I will do it. Just stay there.

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:08.097
It's fine. Stay there. I will handle it.
Stay there, you fucking casualty.

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:10.266
Okay, the other day,

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:13.644
my sister and I were at home
eating popcorn and crying,

01:11:13.727 --> 01:11:16.230
and we got down to the bottom of the bag.

01:11:16.313 --> 01:11:19.650
And, shake, shake, shake,
what was left at the bottom?

01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:21.443
All the unpopped kernels.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:25.114
That's when my sister and I
decided that we should...

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:28.993
Put your fucking back..."

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:30.786
[laughter and applause]

01:11:30.869 --> 01:11:32.371
"Against mine.

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.164
Put your fucking back against mine!

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:37.293
What the fuck are you doing?
I am trying... No! No!

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.628
You're not gonna fucking do this
to me again!

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:43.215
I am trying to keep this family together!
Do you not understand that?

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.925
No, this is not about me!

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:47.720
I am trying to help!
This is nothing like when Daddy died!

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:49.179
You are being a bitch!

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:51.056
I am trying to keep this family...

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.600
She does this! She does this every time!

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:56.186
Everybody's gonna know
that you're a fucking...

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:59.815
I wasn't flirting with your husband!
You are so fucking insecure!

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:01.942
Because I slept with your boyfriend
in high school

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:03.485
and he turned out to be gay!

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.654
No, it wasn't your fault!
Big fucking deal!

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:07.531
He wanted to talk about your birthday

01:12:07.614 --> 01:12:11.035
so that fucking Michaela could turn 40
for the third time!

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:13.203
You're a fucking bitch! I need a minute!

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.664
I need a fucking minute! I need...

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:17.750
I need a Madison minute! Hold on!

01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:21.420
[sniffs] I'm fucking good.
I'm fucking good!

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:24.089
Let's fucking do it! You wanna go?

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:26.216
Shit. I don't care. I am trying....

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.179
I am not... I can't. I can't. Why are
the walls bleeding? I can't do this.

01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:32.264
I can't fucking do this. I can't do it.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:35.017
You being a... I shit. I shit my pants.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.604
Oh, good news. It's not shit. It's blood!
It's blood, you fucking monster!

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:42.358
I am trying... I can't... No.
You know what? I am keeping it together.

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:45.486
I am the stable one!
I am keeping it... I am not...

01:12:45.569 --> 01:12:48.155
I am not yelling!
I am not yelling. I am not yelling.

01:12:48.238 --> 01:12:51.283
Huh? What? Yes, it's a hive.
This happens.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:55.204
It happens every time you open
your fucking whore mouth! Yes, I know!

01:12:55.287 --> 01:12:57.122
And I'm trying...

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.792
I'm a good feminist.
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:00.918
I'm sorry!

01:13:01.001 --> 01:13:03.337
I'm sorry! My tan is dripping off.

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.922
I am not..."

01:13:05.005 --> 01:13:07.132
[hyperventilates]

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.592
"I am not...

01:13:08.675 --> 01:13:11.804
I am not... [exhales]
I am not yelling. I am not yelling!

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:14.098
-I am using..."
-[laughter]

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:16.016
"I am using the vocabulary

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.143
that Dr. Goldstein told us to use."

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.061
[laughter]

01:13:19.144 --> 01:13:21.980
"I am requesting..."

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:24.149
[screams]

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.776
"that you....

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.320
hear... my..."

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.365
[laughter]

01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:34.743
"desire... to communicate...

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.954
in an open way...

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:39.581
and put your fucking back against mine!

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:42.751
She's ruining it!
She's ruining everything!"

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:46.380
[hyperventilates]

01:13:46.463 --> 01:13:48.841
"She's ruining it. This is a big deal.

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:51.802
We put everything...
We put everything into this company!"

01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:54.596
"Did you really?" "No, but my mom did."

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.223
[laughter]

01:13:56.306 --> 01:13:59.059
"I am trying to keep it together.
Everybody depends on me

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:03.355
because we spent all of our money
on our first company and it shat the bed."

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:06.567
"What was your first company?"
"I'm gonna tell them."

01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:08.402
[laughter]

01:14:08.485 --> 01:14:10.654
"I'm gonna tell them
and you're gonna look like

01:14:10.737 --> 01:14:14.867
the fucking psycho bitch that you are.
Everyone's gonna know. I'm gonna...

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:18.328
I'm gonna tell the cameras.
Is this camera still on? Good."

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:20.622
[laughter]

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:26.003
[laughter]

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:28.589
"Fuck you."

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:31.216
[laughter]

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:34.052
"Do you remember when...

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:38.724
Um... Fuck, it's, like,
stuck right here in my nose."

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.517
[sniffs and gasps]

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.644
-[laughter]
-"Uhh!

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:47.274
Do you remember when, um,
our country went through a recession,

01:14:47.357 --> 01:14:51.528
and everybody was losing their homes
and their money?

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:55.115
My sister and I decided that rather
than save up or go back to school,

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:58.327
we would do what every other girl
without a marketable skill did,

01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:02.247
we... opened up a cupcake company."

01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:05.000
[laughter]

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:08.504
[cheering and applause]

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:13.217
"I don't know if you noticed,
but during the recession,

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.303
there was a fucking boom
in the confection industry!

01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:19.515
That's because it doesn't take
a fucking rocket science degree

01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:21.600
to shit out, like, an okay cupcake.

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:24.102
And, like,
no one's gonna say no to a cupcake.

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:27.105
People will spend their last dollar.
They're not gonna be like, "No,"

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.816
they'll be like,
"A cupcake. My day's okay for a minute."

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.027
And we were feeding people these cupcakes

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:34.488
and they were upside-down on their houses

01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:37.741
and they were jobless and we were feeding
these depressed people cupcakes.

01:15:37.824 --> 01:15:40.452
And it's a scientific fact
that obesity and depression

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.789
have a direct correlation, and we were
just feeding the belly of the beast

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:46.750
from within the belly of the beast
and capitalizing off of it.

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:50.379
People needed answers.
They needed a viable option for credit,

01:15:50.462 --> 01:15:54.508
not a buttercream... Put your fucking back
against mine! I swear to Christ, Michaela,

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:56.843
if you ruin this for me,
I will fuck your husband!

01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:59.555
Screw it! Cut!
I should've been a mermaid!"

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:04.560
[cheering and applause]

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:17.698
[dance music]

01:17:14.087 --> 01:17:15.464
Pack your hip!
