00:02.509 --> 00:06.966
Goddamn it, Ray. Are you drunk?

00:07.086 --> 00:09.615
- No, dumbass, are you?
- No.

00:09.735 --> 00:12.637
- Although not for lack of trying.
- Exactly, that's my

00:12.771 --> 00:16.373
- whole point.
- Oh, how can you drink

00:16.509 --> 00:20.245
- rum with all this turbulence?
- Oh, my God! That's my whole point!

00:20.379 --> 00:24.315
Enough already! My God,
are you people paid by the word?

00:24.450 --> 00:28.353
It's bad enough I'm packed into this
flying boxcar with you...

00:28.487 --> 00:32.256
...without all this incessant bickering.
It's like I'm stuck on a school

00:32.391 --> 00:36.761
bus with the worst driver on the planet!

00:36.896 --> 00:40.231
- What was that? - It is
kind of like a school bus.

00:40.366 --> 00:43.468
- When have you ever been on a bus?
- No, from the movies.

00:43.602 --> 00:46.771
We've got the whole Breakfast Club in here.
I'm Emilio Estevez.

00:46.906 --> 00:50.475
Cyril's obviously Anthony Michael Nerd.
Mother, you're Paul Gleason.

00:50.609 --> 00:55.580
Krieger's the loose cannon, Judd
Nelson, and Lana, you're... um...

00:55.714 --> 01:00.185
- Wait, seriously? Molly Ringwald.
- Eh...

01:00.319 --> 01:03.154
- Oh, my God. - What
the hell are you talking about?

01:03.289 --> 01:06.324
Mother, hush. Lana, come on, if any
of you ISIS women is Molly Ringwald...

01:06.458 --> 01:09.427
- It's obviously Cherlene.
- Totally.

01:09.562 --> 01:12.397
- What? - Yes, she's
the rich one, she's a redhead...

01:12.531 --> 01:15.900
- So, what, you think I'm Ally Sheedy?
- Are you all just

01:16.035 --> 01:19.537
- saying random words? - Ally Sheedy
would've been way more likely to get

01:19.672 --> 01:22.540
- pregnant in high school. 
- Had there been a sequel.

01:22.675 --> 01:25.343
- God forbid. - Right?
- And as for who's the

01:25.477 --> 01:28.880
- hot one... - Wait, what, of us?
I'm the hot one!

01:29.014 --> 01:32.283
- Eh... - Oh, my God.
- Oh, get over

01:32.418 --> 01:35.286
- yourself!  - Shh!
Will you shut up?

01:35.421 --> 01:38.021
- Oh, please. She knows
we're in here. - She will if you

01:38.023 --> 01:41.192
- don't shut up.
- Pam, I know you're in there.

01:41.327 --> 01:45.964
No, we're not. But if we are, which
I don't admit to, which Breakfast

01:46.098 --> 01:50.335
- Clubber am I? - Hmm, I guess
the janitor everybody thinks is

01:50.469 --> 01:54.606
- gross but turns out to be cool. - Aw.
- I love

01:54.740 --> 01:59.277
that you take that as a compliment.

02:38.507 --> 02:42.410
- So, can we get out of the crate now?
- No, but as it seems

02:42.544 --> 02:47.381
we've arrived at a pause in the idiocy, let's
recap the plan for when we land in San Marcos.

02:47.516 --> 02:51.219
Yeah, because I'm curious how we tell
Calderón we turned six million dollars'

02:51.353 --> 02:54.856
worth of cocaine into one million
dollars' worth of weapons.

02:54.990 --> 02:57.892
That's the CIA's problem.
Calderón doesn't care.

02:58.026 --> 03:01.395
- It's all gravy to him. - Yeah, Lana.
I was actually wondering that

03:01.530 --> 03:04.866
- myself. - All that matters
is that Calderón pays us for this

03:05.000 --> 03:09.070
shipment. Then we use the profits to
buy more weapons, which we sell to

03:09.204 --> 03:13.274
him to make more profits to buy
more weapons. Blah, blah, blah.

03:13.408 --> 03:17.545
- Lana, for God's sakes,
it's Econ 101. - Cyril, don't be

03:17.679 --> 03:20.548
- shitty. - Yeah, Cyril!
- Tower

03:20.682 --> 03:24.285
to unidentified aircraft, you are now
entering restricted San Marcos airspace.

03:24.419 --> 03:28.156
- Identify yourself. - Uh, guys?
- Just tell them Slater

03:28.290 --> 03:31.192
- sent us. - You think that's a
good idea, flying into a war zone,

03:31.326 --> 03:35.363
- telling them we're with the CIA?
- If Slater even was CIA.

03:35.497 --> 03:38.799
Now, he's the one who teabagged
you?

03:38.934 --> 03:41.802
- Beanbagged.
- Oh, whichever. - It's a fairly

03:41.937 --> 03:44.972
- important distinction. - Sorry,
can I be a nag for a second?

03:45.107 --> 03:48.075
Oh, my God, Lana, I've
had only, like, eight drinks.

03:48.210 --> 03:51.279
- Okay, not that, but wait, really?
- Yeah, I've totally

03:51.413 --> 03:55.483
cut back, and not that it's any of your
beeswax, but I've also cut back on... you know.

03:55.617 --> 04:00.221
On what? Sterling, with you,
that could almost literally be anything.

04:00.355 --> 04:03.558
- Anonymous sex, if you must know.
- Ew!

04:03.692 --> 04:06.360
- Beechcraft, please identify. 
- Guys?

04:06.495 --> 04:09.363
- Really? - I've totally,
relatively cleaned up my act.

04:09.498 --> 04:13.367
So maybe keep that in mind when you're
choosing godparents.

04:13.502 --> 04:17.572
I will, Archer. I really will.

04:17.706 --> 04:20.241
- Beechcraft, identify. - Guys!
- Goddamn it, tell him

04:20.375 --> 04:22.944
- Slater sent us. - Wait, wait,
wait, wait. - Tower, this is

04:23.078 --> 04:26.147
- Beechcraft. - Ray!
- Uh, Slater sent us?

04:26.281 --> 04:29.283
Beechcraft, you are clear for

04:29.418 --> 04:32.587
- landing. - Thank you
for hearing my concerns.

04:32.721 --> 04:36.857
Jesus, will you relax?

04:36.992 --> 04:40.194
What's the worst that

04:40.329 --> 04:43.464
- could happen?
- Get on the ground!

04:43.599 --> 04:46.601
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

04:46.735 --> 04:49.971
Way
to go, Gilligan.

04:50.105 --> 04:54.609
<i>-  Silencio!</i> Who is in charge here?
- Señor Presidente,

04:54.743 --> 04:57.878
- I... 
-  Not you, you baboon-faced baboon.

04:58.013 --> 05:02.016
I am obviously talking to these gringos, and also,
if I am here, then you are obviously not in

05:02.150 --> 05:05.286
- charge. 
- I...

05:05.420 --> 05:10.992
And to repeat,

05:11.126 --> 05:15.363
- who is in charge here? - That would
be... - Because they are to

05:15.497 --> 05:18.866
- blame for this shipment of weapons being
late. - Her, that older woman

05:19.001 --> 05:24.005
- down there with the more or less permanent
scowl. - Señor Presidente, it

05:24.139 --> 05:29.010
- is such an honor to meet you. I'm
Malory Archer. - Wow.

05:29.144 --> 05:33.514
Well, thank you.
Anyhoo, hello?

05:33.649 --> 05:38.219
- So, the stories are true.
- What stories?

05:38.353 --> 05:41.355
I... no, not what, huh? Damn
it, man, I was sleepwalking.

05:41.490 --> 05:44.992
Eh? 
Hey, what's

05:45.127 --> 05:48.029
going on?
Maybe you're their god.

05:48.163 --> 05:50.998
Okay,
all but him, arrest.

05:51.133 --> 05:54.435
Without
even checking the merchandise?

05:54.569 --> 05:58.572
Although not that particular

05:58.707 --> 06:02.343
merchandise.

06:09.685 --> 06:14.689
- Goddamn it! Who the hell drilled
my box?! - So, we're just done

06:14.823 --> 06:17.992
with phrasing, right? That's
not a thing anymore?

06:18.126 --> 06:20.995
- I know, right? - Cherlene.
- What?!

06:21.129 --> 06:23.664
Wait, what?!
Yeah, seriously, what?

06:23.799 --> 06:27.368
"Outlaw Country," "Hoochie Coochie
Coochie Man," "Travis County Limitado."

06:27.502 --> 06:31.572
I am... I am your biggest fan. Please,
we go to the presidential palace?

06:31.707 --> 06:34.709
- I'm fine, too, by the way.
- Oh, great.

06:34.843 --> 06:37.545
- That's good. - Please, come,
come. Come, come, come, come, come.

06:37.679 --> 06:40.481
- So, phrasing's just dead then?
- What is your...?

06:40.615 --> 06:43.617
Wait, are you drunk?
Please. Off 12 drinks?

06:43.752 --> 06:47.054
- Viva Cherlene! Viva Cherlene!
- Cherlene!

06:47.189 --> 06:50.524
- Cherlene!
- Wait a minute, you said eight drinks!

06:50.659 --> 06:54.328
I lied.
I mean, yes, eight.

06:54.463 --> 06:56.897
Cherlene! Cherlene!

07:02.522 --> 07:07.426
Holy dickballs!
I mean, I mean, I mean, just

07:07.560 --> 07:10.429
- holy....
- Dickballs. Yes, Pam, I got it.

07:10.563 --> 07:13.698
- Are you sure? The room is okay?
- Yeah, it's fine, whatever.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.701
I-I cannot believe
it is actually you.

07:16.836 --> 07:20.205
Here in my palace, I mean...
Yeah, it's blowing your mind, huh?

07:20.339 --> 07:24.209
- Boom! - Yeah.
Can I please bring you anything?

07:24.343 --> 07:27.579
A freshly squeezed juice, a cocktail,
a sandwich of your own choosing?

07:27.713 --> 07:30.582
Don't you, like,
have a war to go to?

07:30.716 --> 07:34.419
It's in the mountains far, far
away where we will crush the communist rebel

07:34.554 --> 07:38.757
dogs! Especially now that we are
once again receiving weapons.

07:38.891 --> 07:43.328
Yoo-hoo! And about that, I was
hoping that you and I could discuss

07:43.463 --> 07:47.699
- our terms? - I... but Cherlene?
- Is exhausted.

07:47.834 --> 07:52.637
- As is my drink.
- Why do we always have

07:52.772 --> 07:57.175
- to share a room? - The sinister gay
cabal, Cyril, you have fallen victim to

07:57.310 --> 08:00.545
- the sinister gay cabal. - Okay,
you know... - I don't know why we

08:00.680 --> 08:05.250
- always get stuck together. But I kind of
don't mind it. - Hmm, actually I don't

08:05.384 --> 08:10.455
- either, now that I think...
- Queer!

08:10.590 --> 08:16.194
♪ Apache

08:16.329 --> 08:19.598
Helicopters We should sell
those 'Cause I'm a ropper. ♪

08:19.732 --> 08:23.301
Ropper...
Wow, that's awful.

08:23.436 --> 08:26.771
But so far, being an international
arms dealer is not.

08:26.906 --> 08:31.510
I could get extremely used to this.
Matt, Joel, hi, shut up.

08:31.644 --> 08:34.679
Let's set up lunch with Adnan
Khashoggi, I...

08:34.813 --> 08:39.384
Whoa, whoa, uh, uh, oh,
I ju... oh, ah, I just...

08:39.519 --> 08:45.290
I... oh, got a, I got a... whoa,
ho, ho, ho, oh, ho, ho, oh, no!

08:52.098 --> 08:55.700
- Uh, may I help you?
- I'm sorry to bother

08:55.835 --> 08:59.638
- you, sir. - No, no, you didn't,
aren't, or rather you couldn't,

08:59.772 --> 09:04.743
or still haven't, I... 
I thought you might need more towels.

09:04.877 --> 09:09.848
Oh, uh, no. I-I think
I'm okay for right now.

09:09.982 --> 09:13.418
Although that being
said, it's better to be safe than

09:13.553 --> 09:17.556
sorry, at least with regards to towels.

09:17.690 --> 09:22.327
But only towels.
Hey, are there more towels?

09:22.461 --> 09:26.565
- Hey, are there more towels? Hey, are
there more...? - You realize this

09:26.699 --> 09:29.601
- isn't a hotel, right? - And even if
it were, that is not how you'd go about

09:29.735 --> 09:33.972
- getting towels! - Who are you,
Princess... hang on... Lana?

09:34.106 --> 09:36.975
- Well played. - I've got crate lag.
- And where are you

09:37.109 --> 09:39.978
- going with that? - Ice machine.
- Ooh, hey, I could use

09:40.112 --> 09:42.981
- some ice. - Oh, and if you see
a housekeeping cart, can you grab

09:43.115 --> 09:46.785
- me some towels? - Yep!
- You're not going to,

09:46.919 --> 09:49.921
- are you? - Nope!
- Goddamn it.

09:50.056 --> 09:53.858
Ha, hee, cold, cold, cold...
And there, but for the grace of...

09:53.993 --> 09:58.496
- Hey, get me fizzy water!
-  Thanks!

09:58.631 --> 10:02.367
- I'm sorry? - Tanks?
- For?

10:02.501 --> 10:07.005
Hmm. Hmm...
Maybe to start?

10:07.139 --> 10:13.111
I... defer to you?
Then yes, I think to start.

10:13.245 --> 10:16.581
Yes? 
Oh.

10:16.716 --> 10:21.720
Yes, please. 
But soon I think more, no?

10:21.854 --> 10:27.726
Well, I should hope so.
Or is that not...?

10:27.860 --> 10:30.895
No, please, of course, I
am willing to do whatever it takes.

10:31.030 --> 10:35.467
Anything.
Well, then that makes two of us.

10:35.601 --> 10:41.773
- Wait, really? Anything?
- Yes?

10:43.242 --> 10:47.045
- Gas? - I'm sorry?
- You have gas?

10:47.179 --> 10:50.139
- Wha...? No! - Oh, my
God, oh, my God, oh, my God, sorry, I'm

10:50.149 --> 10:53.018
- sorry, I'm sorry, I thought you...
- No! For the... No!

10:53.152 --> 10:56.054
- I misunderstood. I apologize.
- And well you should!

10:56.188 --> 10:59.057
- And well I do! Please forgive me.
- I mean...

10:59.191 --> 11:02.394
- What a frickin' clip joint.
- No towels.

11:02.528 --> 11:06.064
No ice machine. 
No towel machine?!

11:06.198 --> 11:09.100
Yeah, right?
What is this-- <i>Escape Fro..?</i>

11:09.235 --> 11:12.103
- Wait, are we still in New York, or...?
- What?

11:12.238 --> 11:15.840
- No, we're in Central America.
- Oh, my God!

11:15.975 --> 11:19.711
- We did it! We're free!
- Do...?

11:19.845 --> 11:23.048
Outlaw different
country woooooo!

11:25.084 --> 11:27.952
- Sometimes I worry about her.
- Eh.

11:28.087 --> 11:31.122
- Ooh, hang on, maybe this is it.
- I don't know.

11:31.257 --> 11:34.526
- It looks kind of... - Ugh, Pam,
they can't leave valuable towels and ice

11:34.660 --> 11:39.531
just lying around. Hotel
profit margins are very thin.

11:39.665 --> 11:45.904
Oh, oh, oh...

11:56.916 --> 12:01.086
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
Krieger? What'd you, see a ghost?

12:01.220 --> 12:04.122
- Oh, my God, please say yes.
- All right, is

12:04.256 --> 12:08.159
that happy hour I smell?
Yes, Mr. Archer. Please join us.

12:08.294 --> 12:11.596
Your mother and I are drinking wine
that belonged to Benjamin Franklin.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.100
- We are? - And discussing
a shipment of four American tanks.

12:15.234 --> 12:19.237
- Oh, tanks! - Thanks.
Tanks? - We do tanks!

12:19.371 --> 12:22.874
- We can do anything, as long as you're
willing to pay. - Me... me pay?

12:23.008 --> 12:25.877
- Good, then it's settled.
- If you say so,

12:26.011 --> 12:28.913
- Mother. - No, no, no, I'm
sorry, I-I thought this was why

12:29.048 --> 12:33.551
the CIA was buying my cocaine. To sell to the
American black people, to make the money to buy

12:33.686 --> 12:37.088
- the weapons to give me to fight
the <i> comunistas.</i> - Exactly.

12:37.223 --> 12:40.091
Wait, what? Why wouldn't they just...?  
Sterling, shut up

12:40.226 --> 12:43.261
- and let me handle this. Because the
problem, Gustavo... - Ooh.

12:43.395 --> 12:46.297
- I'm sorry, may I call you Gustavo?
- No.

12:46.432 --> 12:52.504
The problem, Señor Presidente,
the problem, you see, the problem is...

12:52.638 --> 12:56.474
is the White House has lost faith
in your ability to win this war!

12:56.609 --> 12:59.529
- Ooh. - And so, if you
want any more weapons, you'll have to

12:59.612 --> 13:02.480
- pay for them in cash. - Ooh!
- Starting now.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.550
- No, no, but I cannot afford
to do this! - Oh, please.

13:05.684 --> 13:08.953
Look at you, drinking Ben Franklin's
wine like it's Kool-Aid, surrounded by

13:09.088 --> 13:13.625
- priceless art... Not this one obviously,
but... - Oh, no, this one

13:13.759 --> 13:16.795
- cost 40 millions. - What?!
- Yes, it is an Ivan

13:16.929 --> 13:20.765
Blitko. So we have, in this area,
these very geometric shapes, in these

13:20.900 --> 13:25.603
very bold colors here, and then the thick black
lines are coming here, always drawing the eye to

13:25.738 --> 13:30.008
here, and then, over everything... just
white. Just layer after layer after

13:30.142 --> 13:35.013
layer of pure white. Until you can
see nothing of the painting below.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.883
- Not even with an infrared camera.
- So... what's the

13:39.018 --> 13:43.321
- point? - The point? What
is the point of a beautiful

13:43.455 --> 13:48.767
- woman? And speaking of!
- Hello, darling.

13:48.887 --> 13:53.498
My wife.

14:02.076 --> 14:06.646
- Sterling! Where are your manners?
- Probably in my room,

14:06.780 --> 14:08.845
- so I should go there right now and
find them. - No, no, no, no,

14:08.956 --> 14:14.663
no, please stay. <i>Mi amor,</i> may I present to you
Sterling Archer, and also his charming mother Malory.

14:14.783 --> 14:18.242
- Juliana Calderón.
- A pleasure to meet you, Juliana.

14:18.362 --> 14:20.594
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, may I call you...

14:20.714 --> 14:23.646
No.
Uh, darling, how was your afternoon?

14:23.766 --> 14:26.606
- Exhausting.
- Mmm.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.877
- So hot and sweaty. To
be honest, I'm... - Mmm.

14:31.011 --> 14:33.880
- really quite sore.
- You see?

14:34.014 --> 14:37.483
This is why I disapprove. Juliana sometimes
goes among the servants, pretending to be a

14:37.618 --> 14:41.254
maid, or working in the laundry, even
one time helping to carry some rocks?

14:41.388 --> 14:44.590
Oh, how... 
Inspiring, really.

14:44.725 --> 14:47.645
I was just showing them the Blitko.
Do you like what you

14:47.761 --> 14:52.431
- see, Mr. Archer? - You know,
so much that... I-I'm gonna go write

14:52.566 --> 14:59.272
about it in my art journal!
She is going to bring us some tanks, so that we

14:59.406 --> 15:04.243
may crush the rebel dogs. Did
they tell you what is for dinner?

15:04.378 --> 15:07.880
Clones? 
Yes, clones! My God, it was like looking

15:08.015 --> 15:11.817
in... several mirrors!
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man...

15:11.952 --> 15:16.789
- Archer! - What?!
- Ow, ah, hang on...

15:16.924 --> 15:20.393
- gotta stitch... oh... - Damn it, I
don't have time for... wait, Pam, did you

15:20.527 --> 15:24.664
find an ice machine?
Huh-uh. Ow, hang on...

15:24.798 --> 15:27.333
- Goddamn it... - Clones!
- What?

15:27.467 --> 15:30.002
- Krieger says-- ow, hold on...
- Goddamn it!

15:30.137 --> 15:33.239
- Krieger says he saw a bunch
of clones! - Of what?

15:33.373 --> 15:35.841
- Of me! We're running to find them.
- Wait, what?

15:35.976 --> 15:39.245
- I thought we were running away from them!
- Hang on, shut up,

15:39.379 --> 15:43.482
hold that thought.
Guys, come on, let's go!

15:43.617 --> 15:46.319
- Not without a bunch of garlic and
some wooden stakes. - What...?

15:46.453 --> 15:49.855
They're clones, not vampires!
It doesn't matter to the stake!

15:49.990 --> 15:52.658
- What're you... we can't kill them!
- Well, not now.

15:52.793 --> 15:55.861
We wait till morning and then murder
them in their coffins. Cyril?

15:55.996 --> 15:59.231
- Thoughts? - I just really wish
I hadn't come on this stupid trip.

15:59.366 --> 16:06.672
But since I did... 
Taaaaanks! You jerks.

16:11.511 --> 16:14.580
Don't even want to

16:14.715 --> 16:17.717
know. 
Lana! Lana!

16:17.851 --> 16:21.520
Oh, my God, you gotta help me!
Oh, for the... there is no ice machine!

16:21.655 --> 16:25.024
Okay, not that, but A) a palace
this big definitely has an ice machine,

16:25.158 --> 16:28.394
maybe not in the hall, but it's not
like they make ice with trays.

16:28.528 --> 16:30.930
- B)... - "B" is hey, shut up,
because I want to talk to you

16:31.064 --> 16:34.464
- about that thing where you said you're cleaning
up your act. - Which I'm actually

16:34.534 --> 16:38.471
pretty serious about, by the way, but right
now I want to talk about this other thing

16:38.605 --> 16:43.576
where I just banged Calderón's wife.
Lana?

16:43.710 --> 16:47.680
Uh, hang on. Okay.

16:47.814 --> 16:52.718
Why would you do that?!
I... I'm sorry, do you mean where?

16:52.853 --> 16:56.622
No, Archer, I mean why! What
happened to no more anonymous sex?

16:56.757 --> 16:59.625
It wasn't anonymous, Lana.
I thought she was the maid.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.795
- Why would you think that?!
- I'm sorry, do you

17:02.929 --> 17:06.398
mean why? 
Wh... Yes! Why?!

17:06.532 --> 17:09.902
Uniform, towels, the usual maid stuff!
The... whoa-whoa-whoa-

17:10.037 --> 17:13.305
whoa, back up. What is your
definition of anonymous sex?

17:13.440 --> 17:15.875
- I don't know, bird masks?
- What?

17:16.009 --> 17:18.544
Or a woman you literally
bump into on the train.

17:18.679 --> 17:21.946
Or the ferry. Or in a port-a-john
at the Preakness that time, but not

17:22.082 --> 17:25.084
somebody who works directly for a
president, I can tell you that.

17:25.218 --> 17:29.088
I mean, we're talking major security clearance,
so you got to assume there's a pretty

17:29.222 --> 17:35.061
- thorough vetting process for... that...
you know... - You done?

17:35.195 --> 17:38.998
- Hang on. Yes?
- Okay. So.

17:39.132 --> 17:46.305
Here's my advice. Do with it as you will.

17:46.440 --> 17:53.913
Hey, are you going

17:54.047 --> 17:59.618
to this dinner?
Or did you already eat...

17:59.753 --> 18:03.989
crayons? 
Should we not just start?

18:04.124 --> 18:06.992
Not
until the guest of honor arrives.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.829
Woooooo-hoo! 
Yes, yes, yes, yes,

18:09.963 --> 18:12.724
yes, yes, come, come, come, come,
come, come, because I am pulling out!

18:12.733 --> 18:16.068
- Phrasing, boom!
- Thank you.

18:16.203 --> 18:18.804
How's the balls?
Ruined? I'm pretty sure?

18:18.939 --> 18:21.507
Okay, you sit there.
Uh... you.

18:21.641 --> 18:24.477
- Up. - I beg your pardon?
- Get up.

18:24.611 --> 18:27.931
- Come on, move it, up, up, up! - Well,
of all the... - Please, Cherlene.

18:28.048 --> 18:33.486
Everyone, raise a glass, and join me to toast
Cherlene! Because-- and I happen to know

18:33.620 --> 18:38.991
this for a fact-- her debut album has
now officially sold one million copies!

18:39.126 --> 18:41.660
Yay!

18:41.795 --> 18:44.396
- How? It came out,
like, yesterday. - Yes!

18:44.531 --> 18:47.066
Amazing! A toast.
No, like literally

18:47.200 --> 18:50.069
yesterday.
And now it is platinum.

18:50.203 --> 18:53.639
A toast! 
I just don't see how it's possible.

18:53.774 --> 19:01.447
It doesn't matter

19:01.581 --> 19:04.416
how! A toast!
 Hear, hear!

19:04.551 --> 19:09.121
And also
let us not forget my brave soldiers, yes,

19:09.256 --> 19:14.059
- out there, fighting those rebel dogs,
far away! - And plus that one right

19:14.194 --> 19:17.730
- there. - Señor Presidente!
The rebels have broken through

19:17.864 --> 19:20.733
our lines!
They...

19:23.937 --> 19:27.873
They are now within mortar range!

19:28.008 --> 19:30.876
- Oh, my God! It's starting!
- What is?

19:31.011 --> 19:35.815
- Cherlenemania! - It's
a mortar attack! - I know!

19:35.949 --> 19:39.985
How frickin' outlaw country
is that?!

19:40.187 --> 19:42.054
♪ I'll burn it down

19:42.189 --> 19:43.923
I'll burn it down to the ground
