WEBVTT

03:40.657 --> 03:42.716
Aha! You like it?

03:42.793 --> 03:46.456
Well, everybody join with me.
We sing together, huh?

04:20.797 --> 04:23.698
Thank you.

04:23.767 --> 04:27.567
Thank you. Thank you.

04:30.641 --> 04:34.772
You want more? You do?
Well, aren't you wonderful?

04:34.846 --> 04:36.973
Wait. Don't go away.
I'll be right ba-

04:37.048 --> 04:39.983
I'll be right back
with the luscious Colette.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.384
Boy, it's a great audience.
Best yet.

04:48.459 --> 04:50.552
- They love you.
- And what about you?

04:50.628 --> 04:52.721
- I love you too.
- Well, give me a kiss.

04:52.797 --> 04:55.664
- No. Turn around.
- Not till you give me a kiss. Okay.

04:55.733 --> 04:58.327
- You know something?
- What?

04:58.403 --> 05:01.497
Gapeaux will be moving us
up to the Terrace Room soon. The big show.

05:01.572 --> 05:04.700
- He's crazy if he doesn't.
- Don't say that. He is crazy.

05:04.776 --> 05:07.244
- Hurry up. Come on.
- All right. Thank you.

05:12.283 --> 05:17.050
Come. Duran is landing any minute.
We've got Nice on the television. Come on!

05:18.289 --> 05:20.723
Oh, it's Duran!
Come on. Come with me.

05:20.792 --> 05:23.852
Duran is landing. Come with me.

05:25.997 --> 05:28.090
- Okay. Ready?
- Wait a second, lassie.

05:28.166 --> 05:31.829
- There is a wee spot on my kilt here.
- Well, I'll fix that.

05:31.903 --> 05:34.701
Stop it! You tickle.

05:34.772 --> 05:37.263
Hey, we're on.

05:55.126 --> 05:59.392
Watch it, Mac.

05:59.464 --> 06:01.694
What-

06:04.068 --> 06:06.468
Hey! Wait a minute.
What's going on in there?

06:06.537 --> 06:10.531
- It is Duran. He's landing.
- Duran! Let's go and see!

06:13.212 --> 06:16.579
Huge crowds have gathered
to welcome the nation's hero...

06:16.648 --> 06:18.741
Capitaine Henri Duran.

06:18.817 --> 06:20.910
Not since the arrival
of Lindbergh...

06:20.986 --> 06:23.546
has a flight created
so much excitement.

06:23.622 --> 06:26.420
When his magnificent plane,
the Victory, touches the ground...

06:26.492 --> 06:29.655
he will have broken the round-the-world
nonstop flight record...

06:29.728 --> 06:33.664
by more than 12 hours,
a great, great achievement.

06:33.732 --> 06:36.860
You can feel
the mounting tension of the crowd.

06:38.070 --> 06:40.595
Is he gonna land in all that fog?

06:40.672 --> 06:44.836
Jack, don't be so vain. Put on your
glasses so you can see something.

06:44.910 --> 06:47.174
Ah, it is he!

06:47.246 --> 06:51.580
The Victory is coming in!
Just listen to that crowd roar!

07:16.208 --> 07:20.770
And now, on the platform, the distinguished
committee of high officials...

07:20.846 --> 07:23.781
waits to receive
the great capitaine.

07:23.849 --> 07:27.649
Even the air minister is here
to pay him honor.

07:27.719 --> 07:30.620
In just a moment now,
Capitaine Duran will appear.

07:30.689 --> 07:33.487
He has been at the controls
for more than two days...

07:33.559 --> 07:37.188
and, without sleep,
he must be exhausted.

07:37.262 --> 07:40.561
Bravo!

07:44.203 --> 07:46.468
The first to greet the capitaine...

07:46.539 --> 07:49.133
are Philippe Labrix
and Louis Forel...

07:49.209 --> 07:53.407
his associates in the manufacture
of these magnificent planes.

07:53.480 --> 07:58.076
We have been told that Air Europa
has given them a contract for 50 of them.

07:58.151 --> 08:02.315
Hey, Colette. Doesn't he look familiar
to you? Kind of like somebody we know?

08:02.388 --> 08:04.481
- Mmm-
- Huh? Huh?

08:04.557 --> 08:06.650
You know, he looks much like you!

08:06.726 --> 08:10.662
That's what I thought, too, except I
didn't want to be the one to say it.

08:10.730 --> 08:14.564
Good-looking chap, isn't he?

08:16.169 --> 08:19.502
Aha! Here is Madame Duran...

08:19.572 --> 08:22.063
the beautiful wife of the capitaine.

08:22.141 --> 08:25.008
Oh, no, no. Sorry.
That is not Madame Duran.

08:25.078 --> 08:27.546
It is Elena Petrovna,
the ballet dancer.

08:27.614 --> 08:30.708
Ah, now we have Madame Duran.

08:30.783 --> 08:32.909
A situation, no?

08:32.986 --> 08:36.046
No. No, sorry again.

08:36.121 --> 08:40.388
That is Marilyn Turner,
the American movie star.

08:40.460 --> 08:44.054
Wait, wait! Let us hope that this
is Madame Duran!

08:44.130 --> 08:47.065
Ah, oh, yes. There is no doubt.

08:47.133 --> 08:49.226
This is really Madame Duran.

08:49.302 --> 08:51.896
What a giant among men.

08:51.971 --> 08:54.405
Capitaine Duran. Capitaine, please.

08:54.474 --> 08:56.834
Would you kindly say a few words
to the television audience?

08:56.876 --> 08:59.208
- Congratulations, Capitaine!
- Did you have any trouble, Capitaine?

08:59.279 --> 09:02.920
- What did you think about while you were making
this flight? - Will you give us a statement?

09:02.949 --> 09:06.441
- I would be delighted.
- The whole world is waiting to hear you.

09:06.519 --> 09:09.249
My dear friends,
thank you very much.

09:09.322 --> 09:12.883
I am deeply moved
by this demonstration.

09:12.959 --> 09:16.588
I, uh-I would like to say more,
but I'm sure you will excuse me.

09:16.663 --> 09:19.325
I am really so very tired.

09:19.399 --> 09:22.334
All I would like now
is a bottle of champagne, and after that...

09:22.402 --> 09:24.667
I would like
to go to bed for a week.

09:24.738 --> 09:29.641
Who will join me in cheering my brave comrades
who have made this achievement possible?

09:29.710 --> 09:31.905
- Bravo.
- Bravo!

09:34.148 --> 09:36.912
- How can he?
- What?

09:36.984 --> 09:39.680
Look at other women.
His wife is so beautiful.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.983
Boy, look at those eyes. Those-

09:42.056 --> 09:44.149
Now, come on, you. Back to work.

09:44.224 --> 09:48.820
I've got those too.
I've got beautiful eyes.

09:48.896 --> 09:51.660
This concludes our broadcast
brought to you...

09:51.732 --> 09:53.529
from the Nice Airport.

09:53.601 --> 09:54.881
We now return you to the studio.

09:56.036 --> 09:58.630
I sure hate to follow that guy.
He's terrific, isn't he?

09:58.706 --> 10:01.004
- Oh, Jack.
- Yes?

10:01.075 --> 10:04.135
- Monsieur Gapeaux-he wants to see you.
- He does?

10:04.211 --> 10:06.702
- Uh-huh.
- I'll be right with him. Thank you, Andre.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.442
- Right.
- Did you hear that? Gapeaux wants to see me.

10:09.516 --> 10:12.212
Here we go, baby,
up to the Terrace Room and a raise.

10:12.286 --> 10:14.345
- I do not like it.
- Why not?

10:14.421 --> 10:17.015
- Because when you want to see him, that's a raise.
- Yeah?

10:17.091 --> 10:19.651
But when he wants to see you,
I don't like it.

10:19.727 --> 10:22.025
Ah, do not fret, my bonny lassie.

10:22.096 --> 10:25.224
The clan MacMartin
has never lost a battle yet.

10:25.299 --> 10:27.494
Hee-hee!

10:27.568 --> 10:31.334
No! Saturday night, you are through.

10:31.405 --> 10:34.306
Through? But I don't get it. Why?

10:34.375 --> 10:37.139
Because I no longer
find you amusing.

10:37.211 --> 10:40.408
That's just a matter of personal taste.
I don't happen to like olives.

10:40.481 --> 10:44.247
- The audience loved me.
- I do not care about the audience!

10:44.318 --> 10:47.913
- It is what I like that matters.
- But business is great!

10:47.988 --> 10:50.980
Oh, please do not argue,
Monsieur Martin.

10:51.058 --> 10:54.186
I've seen everything you do,
and I'm bored.

10:54.261 --> 10:56.491
After all, I have to live too.

10:56.563 --> 10:58.929
Look, Monsieur Gapeaux,
I can give you something new.

10:58.999 --> 11:01.195
I've got a lot of
other things I can do.

11:01.269 --> 11:04.534
If you can do something sensational,
I might reconsider.

11:04.606 --> 11:06.801
In the meantime, Saturday night,
you are through.

11:08.309 --> 11:10.675
Well, thank you very much.

11:13.281 --> 11:17.615
- Sensational, huh?
- And it better be better than you are doing now!

11:19.187 --> 11:21.280
Yeah.

11:21.356 --> 11:25.122
Something sensational, huh?

11:25.193 --> 11:30.028
Yeah, sure. Any little thing
will do, just so he likes it.

11:30.098 --> 11:32.965
Who cares what he likes?
Who tells him to watch?

11:33.034 --> 11:35.366
- He owns the place.
- Oh!

11:35.437 --> 11:39.203
Look, let's not argue,
will you, sweetie? Let's just think.

11:44.145 --> 11:46.579
Wait a minute. Maybe this will go.

11:46.648 --> 11:50.414
Ah! I'm mortified!

11:54.856 --> 11:56.790
Nothin', huh?

11:56.858 --> 11:59.622
Well, I don't know.
I just don't know.

11:59.694 --> 12:01.787
I- Wait a minute.

12:09.804 --> 12:13.137
Who is that?

12:13.208 --> 12:15.301
Never mind.

12:18.747 --> 12:21.341
- You really think I look like him?
- Who?

12:21.416 --> 12:24.351
- Duran.
- What has that to do with this?

12:24.419 --> 12:26.785
Nothin'. Nothin'.
I was just lookin'.

12:26.855 --> 12:30.347
Well, you look like him, but
you do not, uh- - Do not what?

12:30.425 --> 12:32.518
Well, it's just that you do not.

12:32.594 --> 12:37.088
I mean, you see, when you look at Duran,
something happens to you.

12:37.165 --> 12:39.430
- Yeah.
- And when I look at you-

12:39.502 --> 12:44.371
Fine. I suppose if Duran walked in here now,
you'd run off with him and leave me flat.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.307
No, Jack, I wouldn't leave you flat.

12:47.376 --> 12:49.469
- I'm in love with you.
- Mmm.

12:49.545 --> 12:51.706
But everyone is
in love with Duran...

12:51.781 --> 12:54.181
and I'm the only one
in love with you.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.548
- You see? That's the difference.
- Oh.

12:56.619 --> 12:58.712
- No savoir faire, huh?
- No savoir faire.

12:58.788 --> 13:01.518
Oh, well, that's just an act
like anything else is.

13:01.590 --> 13:04.616
He happens to be
the big hero at the moment, a great lover.

13:04.693 --> 13:06.718
- You know something?
- What?

13:06.796 --> 13:09.321
I could have what he's got just like that.

13:09.398 --> 13:12.890
I'll show you.
It's very simple. Watch.

14:17.968 --> 14:20.766
Capitaine, I trust
you find this table satisfactory?

14:20.837 --> 14:23.965
- Quite. Thank you very much, Gapeaux.
- Oh, not at all.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.304
- Madame?
- Thank you.

14:44.327 --> 14:46.488
Mesdames...

14:46.563 --> 14:48.656
et messieurs...

14:50.066 --> 14:53.502
we take great pleasure...

14:53.570 --> 14:55.765
in presenting...

14:55.839 --> 14:57.932
to you...

14:58.008 --> 15:00.067
Monsieur Jack Martin...

15:01.177 --> 15:03.577
in his impersonation of...

15:03.647 --> 15:07.917
the one and only
Capitaine Henri Duran!

15:49.959 --> 15:52.052
Duran!

15:52.127 --> 15:55.894
Ahh!

15:55.966 --> 15:58.059
My dear friends-

15:58.134 --> 16:00.694
Mimi, Fifi...

16:00.770 --> 16:02.863
and Celia.

16:04.574 --> 16:06.667
I don't recall your face...

16:06.743 --> 16:09.871
but I'd like to be familiar.

16:29.232 --> 16:31.291
It's uncanny.

16:43.880 --> 16:47.509
You should at least
pretend to be amused, my dear.

16:47.584 --> 16:51.020
Oh, it is amusing, Henri,
and very enlightening.

19:43.595 --> 19:45.586
India!

19:52.204 --> 19:54.263
Pardon.

19:58.843 --> 20:01.744
Hello.

20:23.368 --> 20:25.461
Eeh!

20:31.676 --> 20:34.611
Eeh! Oh, oh. Eeh!

20:34.679 --> 20:38.706
Oh, oh!

20:41.419 --> 20:45.151
Eeh! Oh, eeh! Oh, eeh, oh! Oh!

21:04.777 --> 21:06.768
[ Squeals )

22:08.974 --> 22:10.965
Hey!

23:29.656 --> 23:32.921
- Oh, good, good!
- What about Duran? Is he applauding?

23:32.993 --> 23:35.826
With his hands, yes,
but with his face, I don't know.

23:35.896 --> 23:38.228
- Oh.
- Go ahead. Come on.

23:47.674 --> 23:51.110
- Capitaine, I do hope you were not offended.
- On the contrary.

23:51.178 --> 23:54.147
We found it terribly amusing.
Didn't we, my dear?

23:54.214 --> 23:56.273
Oh, terribly.

23:56.349 --> 23:58.716
I should like to go back
and meet Jack Martin.

23:58.786 --> 24:01.277
But of course!
He would be delighted.

24:01.355 --> 24:04.791
- Would you excuse me, my dear?
- This is quite refreshing.

24:04.859 --> 24:07.657
- What?
- Your going backstage to see a man.

24:07.728 --> 24:09.992
Hmm. I won't be very long.

24:10.064 --> 24:13.693
Don't worry about us, Henri.
We'll either be here or in the bar.

24:13.768 --> 24:16.464
Excuse me.

24:22.610 --> 24:25.010
Please, his dressing room
is just downstairs.

24:25.079 --> 24:27.172
- Monsieur Gapeaux.
- Yes?

24:27.248 --> 24:30.240
You must come at once. The magician
had a terrible fight with his wife.

24:30.318 --> 24:32.912
- She ran off with his rabbit.
- Oh!

24:32.987 --> 24:35.922
Will you excuse me, Capitaine?
This is very sad.

24:35.990 --> 24:39.653
- You see, he loves that rabbit. Quick.
- Right here.

24:47.735 --> 24:49.669
- Eugenie!
- Henri!

24:49.737 --> 24:51.830
My little soufflé!

24:51.906 --> 24:53.999
It's been such a long time.
Two years!

24:54.075 --> 24:56.509
Yes. And still
the soufflé has not fallen.

24:56.577 --> 25:00.411
- Oh, Henri. I must go now. You will call me?
- Yes. Same number?

25:00.481 --> 25:04.247
- And if a man answers?
- That is my husband. He will take the message.

25:06.354 --> 25:09.289
- Very touching! Soufflé, huh?
- I beg your pardon?

25:09.357 --> 25:12.383
You no-good two-face.
The minute you think my back is turned-

25:12.460 --> 25:14.553
Mademoiselle,
you are making a mistake.

25:14.629 --> 25:17.359
- I'm not the one who makes mistakes.
- But this time you are.

25:17.431 --> 25:21.595
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Capitaine Henri Duran at your service.

25:21.669 --> 25:24.900
Capitaine Henri Duran!
Do you expect me to believe-

25:24.972 --> 25:28.408
Ah!
You see, the mustache is real.

25:28.476 --> 25:30.569
It's incredible!

25:30.645 --> 25:33.170
Oh, you've come to see Jack.
You're angry with him.

25:33.247 --> 25:36.809
- You do not wish me to be angry with him?
- Please, no.

25:36.885 --> 25:39.911
Ah. I take it you are
interested in him.

25:39.988 --> 25:42.582
Very much.

25:42.658 --> 25:45.559
Mademoiselle, you should not
be interested in imitations.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.152
You have too much to offer yourself.

25:48.230 --> 25:50.960
A beautiful girl like you
should have the real thing.

25:51.033 --> 25:53.365
Capitaine Duran,
are you making love to me?

25:53.435 --> 25:57.098
But of course. What are you doing,
my dear, after the show?

25:57.172 --> 26:00.005
I have a previous engagement.

26:00.075 --> 26:02.475
Perhaps I could, uh,
persuade you to break it?

26:02.544 --> 26:05.274
You probably could,
but I'm not going to let you.

26:05.347 --> 26:07.679
- Tomorrow night?
- No.

26:07.749 --> 26:11.082
Well, then perhaps
you will come to my villa Saturday evening.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.281
- Certainly not!
- You misunderstand, my dear.

26:14.356 --> 26:18.292
We're having a large reception,
and the house will be filled with people.

26:18.360 --> 26:21.090
Capitaine Duran,
that's a very old one.

26:21.163 --> 26:24.360
I come, and all the other
guests have failed to show up, eh?

26:24.433 --> 26:27.766
Oh, it is my misfortune
that they all will be there.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.963
But please come anyway.

26:30.038 --> 26:32.097
- Here's my card.
- Henri!

26:32.174 --> 26:36.543
- Henri, this telegram-Read it. It is urgent.
- Yes. Just a moment.

26:36.612 --> 26:39.012
- You will come?
- I will think about it.

26:39.081 --> 26:41.174
- Good.
- Good night, Capitaine.

26:41.249 --> 26:43.342
- Good night.
- Will you excuse me?

26:43.418 --> 26:45.613
Antoine just brought it over.
Read it, Henri.

26:45.687 --> 26:49.953
- For heaven's sake, read it!
- Calm yourself, Philippe.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.620
"Regret to advise
Air Europa unable to execute contract...

26:53.695 --> 26:56.061
"for purchase of Victory planes...

26:56.131 --> 26:58.656
"pending further tests.

26:58.734 --> 27:01.532
- "Periton."
- He's only fooling, yes?

27:01.603 --> 27:05.630
- I wish he were, Philippe.
- Why should Periton do this? He needs our planes.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.800
Periton is playing a game.

27:07.876 --> 27:11.334
He knows I'm overextended at the bank
and need money desperately.

27:11.413 --> 27:14.474
- If he delays signing the contract, we are ruined.
- Oh!

27:14.550 --> 27:17.485
He will buy our company
for a song and make the planes himself.

27:17.553 --> 27:20.886
- He cannot do this. It would finish us.
- Definitely.

27:20.957 --> 27:24.518
Unless-Unless I can raise
the money from someone else.

27:24.594 --> 27:26.755
- But who?
- Monsieur Alonzo.

27:26.829 --> 27:30.663
Yes! He always liked me.
But suppose he does not give us the money.

27:30.733 --> 27:33.429
Henri, let's take
what we can and fly to South America.

27:33.503 --> 27:37.439
Stop trembling, Philippe. If you look
like that, no one will give us a penny.

27:37.507 --> 27:42.410
Pull yourself together. If one word of this
leaks out, we are ruined, all finished!

27:42.478 --> 27:46.141
Now, come. I will telephone Monsieur Alonzo
for an appointment immediately.

29:27.084 --> 29:29.484
- Thank you, madame.
- You're quite welcome.

29:29.553 --> 29:32.215
What about the impersonation?
Did you like that too?

29:32.289 --> 29:35.190
Well, you're enormously
successful, monsieur.

29:35.259 --> 29:37.727
- Why should my opinion make any difference?
- But it does.

29:37.795 --> 29:40.525
- It's the only opinion that counts.
- Lili, we must be going.

29:40.597 --> 29:43.395
- Henri will be waiting.
- Sit down, Louis.

29:43.467 --> 29:46.595
- Mine is the only opinion that matters?
- That's right.

29:46.670 --> 29:50.003
And if I didn't like
your impersonation...

29:50.073 --> 29:52.200
would you stop doing it?

29:52.276 --> 29:54.744
- Well, I don't know.
- Oh, don't be frightened, Monsieur Martin.

29:54.812 --> 29:57.076
I'm not going to suggest
that you drop it.

29:57.147 --> 30:00.014
What about the captain?
Did he like it?

30:00.083 --> 30:02.176
Oh, yes, very much.

30:02.252 --> 30:04.618
He's backstage at this
very moment, seeing you.

30:04.688 --> 30:06.918
I know. That's why I came in here.

30:09.493 --> 30:11.927
Tell me something, monsieur.
I'm very curious.

30:11.995 --> 30:14.520
When you do these impersonations,
how do you go about it?

30:14.598 --> 30:16.828
Do you make a study of your victim?

30:16.900 --> 30:18.335
Well, as much as I can. It's something
that comes to me kind of easy, I guess.

30:18.336 --> 30:21.601
Well, as much as I can. It's something
that comes to me kind of easy, I guess.

30:21.672 --> 30:25.199
I try to mimic
his way of speaking, his mannerisms.

30:25.276 --> 30:28.075
You know, sort of put myself
in his shoes.

30:28.146 --> 30:32.378
Like, uh-
Madame, you are very beautiful.

30:32.451 --> 30:35.215
This actor, this Jack Martin...

30:35.287 --> 30:38.415
has never met
a woman like you before.

30:38.490 --> 30:41.357
It will go to his head, like wine.

30:41.426 --> 30:45.192
Yes, monsieur. You do do it easily.

30:45.263 --> 30:49.199
- I suppose you could even do an impression of me.
- No, madame.

30:49.267 --> 30:52.634
To capture you, I would have to reach up
for some stars...

30:52.704 --> 30:55.639
seek the petals of a white rose...

30:55.707 --> 30:59.268
the blue of the sky
over the Mediterranean...

30:59.344 --> 31:02.040
- the sadness that I see in-
- Sadness?

31:02.114 --> 31:06.141
Yes. The sadness that I -

31:06.218 --> 31:08.709
Forgive me, madame.

31:08.787 --> 31:12.223
When I do Captain Duran,
I get carried away. It's a wonderful part.

31:12.290 --> 31:15.384
If I may say so, monsieur,
you have brought something to it...

31:15.460 --> 31:17.826
that I don't think
you saw in the original.

31:17.896 --> 31:20.387
Thank you.

31:20.465 --> 31:23.628
- Now, if you'll excuse us, I think we'd
better get back. - I should think so.

31:23.702 --> 31:25.795
- Good night, Monsieur Martin.
- Good night.

31:25.871 --> 31:29.102
I hope I've given you some new ideas to use
as Capitaine Duran.

31:29.174 --> 31:32.507
You've given me some new ideas to use
as Jack Martin.

31:32.577 --> 31:34.670
- Good night.
- Good night.

31:44.823 --> 31:47.451
"New ideas", huh?

31:47.526 --> 31:49.619
Dropped this, sweetie.

31:49.694 --> 31:53.027
Oh, Jack, darling! This is gorgeous!

31:53.098 --> 31:56.431
What? Oh, wait a minute.
That belongs to Madame Duran.

31:56.501 --> 31:59.197
- Is that so?
- Hey, Colette!

32:11.017 --> 32:13.076
Glorious day.

32:19.959 --> 32:23.861
Such beautiful girls.
I hope Henri gets the money.

32:23.930 --> 32:26.023
Ah, yes, Louis, you are in trouble.

32:26.098 --> 32:28.191
Today you are a rich, fat man.

32:28.267 --> 32:31.293
Tomorrow you'll be only a fat man.

32:31.370 --> 32:33.804
- Periton!
- Stop thinking about Periton.

32:33.873 --> 32:37.673
Thinking about him?
I see him, there, with Lili!

32:40.346 --> 32:44.339
- What is he doing here?
- He's down here for the kill, no doubt.

32:44.417 --> 32:47.875
Let's find out. Come on.
Stop looking like that. Smile!

32:47.954 --> 32:50.047
- Hmm?
- Smile!

32:51.691 --> 32:53.989
Forgive me. Oh, gentlemen.

32:54.060 --> 32:56.358
- I'm delighted to see you.
- Good morning.

32:56.429 --> 32:59.330
- Good morning.
- We thought you were in Paris.

32:59.398 --> 33:02.265
- Yes. What brings you here?
- What brings anyone here?

33:02.335 --> 33:04.895
Climate, beautiful girls-

33:04.971 --> 33:07.201
and, uh, business.

33:07.273 --> 33:09.104
Uh, business?

33:09.175 --> 33:11.700
Yes. I always mix business
with pleasure.

33:11.777 --> 33:14.507
That way my opponents
never know what I'm up to.

33:16.182 --> 33:18.275
I must be going, my dear.

33:18.351 --> 33:20.683
I'll see you this evening.
My best to Henri.

33:20.753 --> 33:24.348
Tell him not to worry.
I shall not forget our long friendship.

33:24.423 --> 33:27.358
I'll try to make things
as easy for him as possible.

33:27.426 --> 33:29.587
Good-bye. Good-bye, gentlemen.

33:29.662 --> 33:31.755
- Good-bye, Felix.
- Good-bye.

33:31.831 --> 33:34.356
- Bye.
- What did he mean by that?

33:34.433 --> 33:36.526
He says Henri needs money.

33:36.602 --> 33:39.298
He seems to think
he's taking over the airplane company.

33:39.372 --> 33:42.205
- Is that true?
- Yes, too true. He has found out everything.

33:42.276 --> 33:44.608
- We'd better tell Henri right away.
- He's at home.

33:44.678 --> 33:46.805
- I'll drive.
- Good.

33:46.880 --> 33:50.475
I invited Felix to the reception
this evening before I knew all this.

33:50.551 --> 33:53.418
- Perhaps I should make some excuse-
- No, you cannot do that.

33:53.487 --> 33:56.581
- Let him come. Then Henri can talk to him.
- Yes, Henri will save us.

33:56.657 --> 33:58.955
- He's the only one who can.
- Yes, Henri.

33:59.026 --> 34:01.995
And for heaven's sake,
take that foolish smile off your face!

34:02.062 --> 34:04.155
- But you told me to!
- Oh!

34:39.866 --> 34:42.801
- Madame. Oh, madame-
- Excuse us, Lili.

34:42.869 --> 34:45.963
The florist, madame. He'd like to see
you about the table arrangements.

34:46.039 --> 34:48.530
- He's on the terrace.
- Thank you, Antoine.

34:53.947 --> 34:56.177
- Antoine! Antoine!
- Yes, monsieur?

34:56.248 --> 34:58.615
- Capitaine Duran-he's not here.
- No, monsieur. He's gone.

34:58.685 --> 35:00.619
- Gone?
- Where?

35:00.687 --> 35:05.624
He did not say, monsieur, and I never ask.
However, he carried a valise.

35:05.692 --> 35:08.320
- Thank you, Antoine. Now, why would he-
- Carry a valise?

35:08.395 --> 35:10.488
- I do not know.
- Neither do I.

35:10.564 --> 35:12.657
- Do you think he has-
- Gone to Paris?

35:12.733 --> 35:15.634
- I do not know.
- Neither do I.

35:15.702 --> 35:18.865
Well, he must have been
in a very big hurry. Look at his desk.

35:18.939 --> 35:21.670
- I've never seen it like that before.
- Look! A note.

35:21.743 --> 35:23.802
It is addressed to both of us.

35:23.878 --> 35:25.937
In Henri's handwriting.

35:26.014 --> 35:31.145
You don't suppose- - Do not start
supposing. Read it, Philippe. Read it.

35:34.255 --> 35:39.488
"Dear friends, I failed last night
to get the money from Alonzo.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.723
Our dear friend Periton seems
to have reached him first."

35:42.797 --> 35:44.856
I knew it. I knew it.

35:44.932 --> 35:47.867
"There is only one hope left-
Sir Hubert Canon.

35:47.935 --> 35:50.028
"I'm flying to London to see him.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.834
If I do not succeed,
you may never see me again."

35:52.907 --> 35:55.000
He's going to kill himself!

35:55.076 --> 35:57.738
"Don't worry.
I'm not going to kill myself.

35:57.812 --> 36:01.714
"I must succeed. But be certain
to say nothing of this to anyone.

36:01.783 --> 36:04.911
If word gets back to Periton,
we are ruined."

36:04.986 --> 36:07.079
"Back to Periton." He's here!

36:07.155 --> 36:09.248
I know, I know.

36:10.825 --> 36:15.524
I- Sir Hubert Canon. Yes, he might.

36:18.966 --> 36:21.992
Louis, we are lost! Completely lost!

36:22.070 --> 36:24.595
- What now?
- The reception tonight!

36:24.672 --> 36:27.732
Lili invited Periton.
If he finds out that Henri is not here-

36:27.809 --> 36:31.802
- He will know that he has gone to London.
- Exactly! We must see Lili.

36:31.879 --> 36:33.870
- At once.
- At once.

36:33.948 --> 36:36.746
- There is but one thing to do. Lili must-
- Call off the reception.

36:36.818 --> 36:38.877
- No, that would be even-
- Worse.

36:38.953 --> 36:41.148
- But she must make some-
- Could I see Madame Duran?

36:41.222 --> 36:43.622
- May I tell madame who's calling?
- Oh, sure.

36:43.691 --> 36:46.159
- Tell her Jack Martin.
- Who?

36:46.227 --> 36:48.286
Jack Martin.

36:48.362 --> 36:51.331
She left her cigarette case
at the Cote d'Azur. I'd like to return it.

36:51.399 --> 36:56.063
- I will see that madame gets it.
- Well, I'd kind of like to give it to her myself.

36:56.137 --> 36:59.073
- I had a pretty tough time getting this back.
- Very well.

36:59.141 --> 37:02.133
- There's the actor.
- The one who impersonated Henri.

37:02.211 --> 37:04.304
- Are you thinking-
- What I am thinking?

37:04.379 --> 37:06.472
- Will it work?
- What have we got to lose?

37:06.548 --> 37:08.573
Nothing.

37:08.650 --> 37:12.279
It will be simple, monsieur.
You just act gracious and charming.

37:12.354 --> 37:14.618
- I don't know.
- We will be right beside you.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.750
- We will not leave you for a moment.
- There. A perfect fit.

37:17.826 --> 37:20.420
- Like it was made for you.
- And think, monsieur.

37:20.496 --> 37:23.624
Half a million francs
for one night's work.

37:23.699 --> 37:25.690
- All right. I'll do it.
- Wonderful!

37:25.768 --> 37:28.498
On two conditions. First, that I get half
the money in advance.

37:28.570 --> 37:30.629
- Yes, yes!
- Agreed.

37:30.706 --> 37:33.766
And second, Madame Duran is not to know
I'm impersonating her husband.

37:33.842 --> 37:35.969
- That is impossible.
- We will have to tell her.

37:36.044 --> 37:38.604
- I'm sorry, gentlemen. Those are my conditions.
- No, wait.

37:38.680 --> 37:42.116
- Why not tell her?
- Because I'd get stage fright, that's why.

37:42.184 --> 37:45.312
I couldn't give a good performance
if I thought she was laughing at me.

37:45.387 --> 37:47.685
I just couldn't go through
with it if she knew.

37:47.756 --> 37:49.849
- If we must agree-
- We must.

37:49.925 --> 37:52.325
- That I insist upon. Okay?
- Okay.

37:52.394 --> 37:56.296
- Okay. You got a deal.
- There are certain things you should know.

37:56.365 --> 37:58.959
- Like what?
- Your wife's name is Lili.

37:59.034 --> 38:01.662
Oh, yes, I know. Lili.

38:01.737 --> 38:04.331
- That's a lovely name, isn't it?
- The butler is Antoine.

38:04.406 --> 38:06.397
The gardener's name is Emile.

38:06.475 --> 38:08.807
- Your chef is Monsieur Popoliniere.
- Who?

38:08.877 --> 38:11.038
- Popoliniere.
- Popoliniere?

38:11.113 --> 38:14.207
Yes. Your pilot's name is Georges.
Your wife's maid is Michele.

38:14.283 --> 38:17.719
- Michele.
- She is rather pretty and a trifle forward.

38:17.786 --> 38:19.879
Forward? How far forward?

38:19.955 --> 38:23.322
You joke with her occasionally.
Sometimes you pinch her cheek.

38:23.392 --> 38:25.485
- Her, uh, cheek.
- Cheek.

38:25.561 --> 38:28.496
- Can you remember all that?
- What, learn a few names?

38:28.564 --> 38:31.658
Gentlemen, that's my business.
I'm supposed to be an actor.

38:33.902 --> 38:36.599
My name is Henri. My wife is Lili.

38:36.673 --> 38:39.403
You are Philippe and Louis.
The butler's Antoine.

38:39.475 --> 38:43.241
The gardener is Emile.
The chef is Monsieur... Popoliniere.

38:43.313 --> 38:46.441
- Good!
- The maid is Michele. I joke with her.

38:46.516 --> 38:49.246
- And occasionally I pinch her cheek.
- Cheek.

38:49.319 --> 38:51.378
Bravo. Bravo.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.854
Hey, about this Felix, this Periton-

38:53.923 --> 38:56.391
- You'll point him out to me?
- The moment he arrives.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.552
- Ah, and what do I say to him?
- Nothing!

38:58.628 --> 39:00.721
- You must say nothing.
- Nothing?

39:00.797 --> 39:03.766
What am I supposed to do,
stand around with egg on my face?

39:03.833 --> 39:06.393
- I have it. Henri has a trick.
- Oh, good.

39:06.469 --> 39:09.768
When he does not understand something
or does not wish to answer...

39:09.839 --> 39:14.367
he taps his fingertips together so,
looks down his nose and says, "Hmm."

39:14.444 --> 39:18.710
You see the beauty of it? He says nothing.
He commits himself to nothing.

39:18.781 --> 39:23.912
He does not understand a word,
but he looks very wise.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.547
Hmm. Say, that's
a pretty good piece of business.

39:26.623 --> 39:29.786
- I think I may be able to use that in my act.
- Yes, you could.

39:29.859 --> 39:33.056
- No. That is not a closet. That leads to Lilt's room.
- Oh, really?

39:33.129 --> 39:35.563
- One moment, monsieur.
- Oh, monsieur.

39:35.632 --> 39:39.159
You and your wife are
on very formal terms.

39:39.235 --> 39:41.328
- Very formal.
- You're kidding.

39:41.404 --> 39:43.497
- What's the matter with him?
- Nothing.

39:43.573 --> 39:45.973
- Doesn't she like him?
- She's crazy for him.

39:46.042 --> 39:48.772
- Well?
- To Henri, the grass is always greener-

39:48.845 --> 39:52.440
- The sky is always bluer-
- The tomatoes are always juicier-

39:52.515 --> 39:54.642
In somebody else's garden.

39:54.717 --> 39:56.844
You understand, monsieur.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.320
- Hmm.
- Good! Good!

40:05.028 --> 40:08.191
- Albert will take you to your table.
- We will see you out there?

40:08.264 --> 40:11.428
- Fine.
- Please, Lili, please!

40:11.502 --> 40:13.595
Our whole future depends on it.

40:13.671 --> 40:16.367
No. Of course I won't.
It's ridiculous!

40:16.440 --> 40:19.807
- Just for these few hours!
- But why should I pretend that I don't know?

40:19.877 --> 40:22.539
Because this actor, this Martin,
insists upon it.

40:22.613 --> 40:25.776
Don't you see, Lili? If he thinks
you don't suspect, it will give him-

40:25.849 --> 40:28.841
Confidence! Make him feel that he
really is Henri.

40:28.919 --> 40:31.854
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Lili, you have nothing to fear.

40:31.922 --> 40:35.016
We have explained that you and Henri
are on very formal terms.

40:35.092 --> 40:37.185
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

40:37.261 --> 40:40.958
As soon as the party is over,
he is to go home. He understands that.

40:41.031 --> 40:44.398
If he does not go, we will not pay him
the other half of the money.

40:44.468 --> 40:47.028
No! It's impossible. Ah, Suzanne!

40:47.104 --> 40:49.436
- Good evening. How are you?
- Ah, Pierre.

40:52.543 --> 40:56.001
- Good evening, Capitaine.
- Good evening, uh, Michele.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.139
- Oh, Michele.
- Yes, Capitaine?

41:01.118 --> 41:03.211
Thank you, Capitaine.

41:03.287 --> 41:07.053
Not at all, my dear. It's my pleasure.

41:09.159 --> 41:11.889
Please, Lili, if you refuse,
it means the end.

41:11.962 --> 41:15.227
- Oh!
- Oh, Lili, you are young and beautiful.

41:15.299 --> 41:18.700
- But Louis and I, we are old-
- And broken.

41:18.769 --> 41:21.135
Shh.

41:22.573 --> 41:27.340
- Good evening, my dear.
- Good evening, Henri.

41:27.411 --> 41:30.437
I, uh, trust the arrangements for tonight
have been managed...

41:30.514 --> 41:32.778
without too much difficulty for you.

41:32.850 --> 41:35.478
So far everything seems
to be proceeding nicely.

41:35.552 --> 41:37.611
Good, good.

41:37.688 --> 41:41.021
The champagne is properly iced
and the birds are properly cooked?

41:41.091 --> 41:43.252
I basted them myself.

41:43.327 --> 41:47.263
Hmm. I am looking forward
to a wonderful party this evening.

41:47.331 --> 41:50.165
What entertainment
have you planned for our guests, Lili?

41:50.235 --> 41:52.362
- Entertainment?
- Yes.

41:52.437 --> 41:56.305
I did have a dreadful disappointment.
I meant to tell you about it earlier.

41:56.374 --> 41:58.638
Really? What is it, my dear?

41:58.710 --> 42:02.669
Well, I tried to get that, um- that performer
that they have at the Cote d'Azur.

42:02.747 --> 42:06.046
- What's his name again?
- - Oh, Jack-Uh, Jack Martin?

42:06.117 --> 42:08.210
Yes, yes. That's the one.

42:08.286 --> 42:10.720
Yes, he's very good. I liked him.

42:10.789 --> 42:14.589
Yes, I thought you did.
That's why I tried to get him, of course.

42:14.659 --> 42:18.493
I'm sure if he had known you wanted him, he
would have been delighted to come to you.

42:18.563 --> 42:22.226
- Do you really think so, Henri?
- I am positive.

42:22.300 --> 42:24.359
Uh, shall we dance?

42:24.436 --> 42:28.167
Why, Henri, I thought
you detested dancing.

42:28.239 --> 42:30.969
I do? Oh, I do.

42:31.042 --> 42:34.876
I do, but, uh, anything
to be near you, my dear.

42:34.946 --> 42:37.437
- How nice.
- Not at all.

42:37.515 --> 42:39.506
Pardon.

42:48.660 --> 42:52.426
- Well, so far, so good.
- Yes. Yes.

42:52.497 --> 42:55.933
What are we so happy about?
Who has he fooled? She knows who he is.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.527
- But he does not know that she knows, so-
- So she has fooled him.

42:59.604 --> 43:02.368
Exactly.

43:09.447 --> 43:12.974
Lili, this is a lovely party.
I must compliment you, my dear.

43:13.051 --> 43:15.713
Why, Henri, you have changed.

43:15.787 --> 43:17.880
- Have I?
- Yes.

43:17.956 --> 43:21.289
Once you would have said to me,
"Parties are so dull.

43:21.359 --> 43:25.193
Let's run away from all our guests,
just you and I, and-".

43:25.263 --> 43:28.392
- And what?
- Henri!

43:37.076 --> 43:39.670
- Come in!
- Where is Jack?

43:39.745 --> 43:42.145
Don't talk to me about Jack!
I hate him!

43:42.214 --> 43:45.877
But where is he?
He's not in his dressing room.

43:45.951 --> 43:48.545
Monsieur Gapeaux,
what's wrong with me?

43:48.621 --> 43:50.714
Nothing! Nothing shows.

43:50.789 --> 43:53.917
That's it! Nothing shows.
Well, I'll fix that!

43:53.993 --> 43:57.759
But you haven't answered me.
Where is Monsieur Martin?

43:57.830 --> 44:00.162
He's not going to be here tonight.

44:00.232 --> 44:03.030
- He sent word that he's indisposed.
- Indisposed?

44:03.102 --> 44:05.935
- Oh!
- But the broadcast-the television broadcast!

44:06.005 --> 44:08.667
- I've made all the arrangements.
- Television?

44:08.741 --> 44:10.902
What are you talking about?

44:10.976 --> 44:14.377
Jack is such a success, the television
people want to put him on the air tonight...

44:14.446 --> 44:16.437
and I said yes.

44:16.515 --> 44:18.676
- Now, where is he?
- You find out and tell me!

44:18.751 --> 44:20.116
I'll go there and break his head!

44:20.219 --> 44:22.020
If he does not show up tonight,
he is through!

44:23.487 --> 44:26.615
He will never work in another nightclub
in France, on the continent.

44:26.691 --> 44:28.818
I have friends. I will finish him!

44:28.893 --> 44:31.521
Good!

44:31.596 --> 44:35.123
- Now tell me nothing shows.
- Oh!

44:35.199 --> 44:38.134
- We will put you on the television.
- No.

44:38.202 --> 44:40.295
But you will be a sensation.

44:40.371 --> 44:43.101
With that neckline, you will be
the Faye Emerson of France.

44:43.174 --> 44:46.610
- I said no.
- Where are you going that you got so undressed?

44:46.677 --> 44:49.237
To the villa
of Capitaine Henri Duran.

44:49.313 --> 44:54.376
My dear Jack is going to find out he's not the
only one who can get himself "indisposed."

45:11.870 --> 45:14.839
Madame Charlier
looks lovely this evening, doesn't she?

45:14.907 --> 45:18.343
- Madame Charlier? - Yes, the woman
over there wearing the diamond choker.

45:18.410 --> 45:22.176
- Oh. - Why, Henri, since when
have you been wearing glasses?

45:22.247 --> 45:24.943
Glasses? Uh, glass-Oh!

45:25.017 --> 45:27.747
Uh, since the flight.
Yes, since the flight.

45:27.819 --> 45:31.414
We were flying over the polar cap,
and the glare was blinding.

45:31.490 --> 45:33.981
- Absolutely blinding.
- Oh.

45:34.059 --> 45:36.619
These are the price
of adventure, my dear.

45:36.695 --> 45:40.153
- Oh, Louise. How nice to see you.
- Lili, darling.

45:40.232 --> 45:42.632
- Henri.
- Charmed, madame, I'm sure.

45:42.701 --> 45:47.161
Isn't he formal tonight?
You old fox. Don't you remember Antibes?

45:47.239 --> 45:52.142
Uh, oh, yes, of course.
Uh, Antibes. Hmm.

45:52.210 --> 45:55.043
I thought you would.
I'll see you later, darling?

45:55.113 --> 45:57.206
Yes, Louise.

45:57.282 --> 45:59.546
Henri, what happened at Antibes?

45:59.618 --> 46:02.815
Lili, would you believe me
if I told you I didn't remember?

46:02.888 --> 46:04.947
Yes, indeed, I would.

46:05.023 --> 46:08.982
Oh, the Peritons.
Madeleine, I'm so glad you could come.

46:09.061 --> 46:12.189
- I'm very happy to be here, Lili.
- You are beautiful as always.

46:12.264 --> 46:14.357
- Henri.
- Good evening.

46:14.433 --> 46:16.526
- Henri.
- How are you, uh, Felix?

46:16.601 --> 46:18.694
- Delighted to see you.
- Thank you.

46:18.770 --> 46:21.500
- And surprised. I rather thought
you'd be in London. - London?

46:21.573 --> 46:24.303
What could I do in London
that I cannot do here?

46:24.376 --> 46:27.174
- You could be seeing Sir Hubert Canon.
- Shh!

46:27.245 --> 46:29.338
Oh, yes, Sir Hubert.

46:29.414 --> 46:32.975
He's a charming fellow,
but hardly worth a trip to London.

46:33.051 --> 46:36.487
Lili, why don't we invite Sir Hubert down
for a weekend soon?

46:36.555 --> 46:39.683
- Oh, but, Henri, he's so dull.
- Oh, no, not really.

46:39.758 --> 46:42.353
It's only the way he talks.

46:42.428 --> 46:44.760
Jolly good hunting yesterday.

46:44.831 --> 46:48.130
Caught three rabbits and the upstairs maid.

46:48.201 --> 46:51.762
You two seem very happy.

46:51.838 --> 46:54.033
- Why not, Felix?
- Yes.

46:54.107 --> 46:57.042
- Henri, perhaps you could
spare me a few moments. - Yes?

46:57.110 --> 47:00.341
That little business matter-
I'd like to discuss it with you.

47:00.413 --> 47:03.610
- Business matter?
- Yes. You know what I mean, of course.

47:03.683 --> 47:06.550
- Uh, hmm.
- Henri!

47:06.619 --> 47:09.679
Pardon. You must come at once-
the telephone.

47:09.756 --> 47:11.849
- The air ministry.
- Air ministry?

47:11.924 --> 47:14.392
- About the planes.
- Oh, good, good.

47:14.460 --> 47:18.226
- The planes?
- Yes. Will you excuse us, Felix?

47:18.297 --> 47:20.231
I'll take it in there.

47:24.437 --> 47:26.997
- What did he want?
- Something about business.

47:27.073 --> 47:29.598
- He wants to see me alone.
- Do not! Whatever you do-

47:29.675 --> 47:32.200
- Do not let him see you alone.
- Suppose he corners me.

47:32.278 --> 47:34.371
- What do I do?
- Radiate confidence.

47:34.447 --> 47:36.779
- Be very sure of yourself.
- But do not say a word.

47:36.849 --> 47:38.942
And another thing,
with Madame Duran-

47:39.018 --> 47:41.111
- You are being much too attentive.
- What?

47:41.187 --> 47:43.280
- Everyone will know-
- That you are not Henri.

47:43.356 --> 47:46.553
- You may pay attention to all the other
women at the party. - But not Lili.

47:46.626 --> 47:50.221
Look, I thought I was giving an inspired
performance. If you want a run-of-the-mill-

47:50.296 --> 47:52.161
You understand. It is dangerous-

47:53.032 --> 47:55.728
Pardon me, Capitaine.
Could I speak with you for a moment?

47:55.802 --> 47:57.895
- Certainly, Antoine.
- In private.

47:57.970 --> 48:00.029
Oh. Excuse me, gentlemen.

48:02.575 --> 48:05.738
- What is it?
- There's a young lady to see you, Capitaine.

48:05.812 --> 48:09.976
- I showed her into the library.
- Uh-Well, do I know her?

48:10.049 --> 48:14.008
I do my best to keep track, Capitaine,
but this is one I have never seen before.

48:14.087 --> 48:17.250
Uh, it's a little difficult
for me to see her now.

48:17.323 --> 48:20.657
- Why don't you send her away?
- I'm afraid that's easier said than done, Capitaine.

48:20.727 --> 48:24.163
She's quite persistent
and might make a most unpleasant scene.

48:24.231 --> 48:27.359
- Ah! - If I might suggest, you
are most adept in such matters.

48:27.434 --> 48:30.028
I am? Oh, yes, of course I am, but-

48:30.104 --> 48:33.801
I have never been in the service of any
gentleman who could handle them as well...

48:33.874 --> 48:35.865
coming and going.

48:35.943 --> 48:38.036
Thank you, Antoine. I will see her.

48:38.112 --> 48:40.080
Thank you, Capitaine.

48:51.358 --> 48:53.724
Di-Uh-

48:53.794 --> 48:55.887
I- Good evening, mademoiselle.

48:55.963 --> 48:58.295
Capitaine Duran,
are you surprised to see me?

48:58.365 --> 49:01.698
Surprised?
I am delighted, astonished.

49:01.768 --> 49:04.862
But you invited me.
Or did I misunderstand you?

49:04.938 --> 49:06.963
No. No.

49:07.040 --> 49:10.737
It's just that I thought you had given
your heart to that young American.

49:10.811 --> 49:15.145
- Martin?
- Yes, he is such a handsome, such a gifted, such a-

49:15.215 --> 49:17.308
Such a big, ugly pig!

49:17.384 --> 49:21.548
But, mademoiselle,
I have always found him charming.

49:21.622 --> 49:24.750
- You don't know him.
- Ah, you are angry.

49:24.825 --> 49:28.352
That is why you have come to see me-
because you are angry with him.

49:28.428 --> 49:31.022
Why do you keep talking about him?

49:31.098 --> 49:35.262
I have a very good reason.
You see, my wife and he-

49:35.335 --> 49:37.667
- No!
- Yes.

49:37.738 --> 49:39.831
She is very attracted to him.

49:39.907 --> 49:41.932
- She is?
- Yes.

49:42.009 --> 49:44.944
And he's attracted to her? Yes?

49:45.012 --> 49:47.105
I'm afraid so.

49:47.181 --> 49:50.947
- There's only one thing we can do, mademoiselle.
- What?

49:51.018 --> 49:53.953
We must, uh, console each other.

49:56.457 --> 49:59.449
- This is our vengeance.
- Please, Capitaine.

49:59.527 --> 50:03.395
Uh-huh. I was right.
You do belong to Martin.

50:03.464 --> 50:05.557
I belong to no one but myself.

50:05.633 --> 50:08.500
It's just that you-

50:08.570 --> 50:11.095
you go too quickly.

50:11.172 --> 50:14.107
Very well, my dear.
I will not frighten you.

50:14.175 --> 50:16.336
We have the whole night before us.

50:16.411 --> 50:18.971
What a beautiful home
you have, Capitaine.

50:19.047 --> 50:22.073
- What lovely pictures.
- I'm glad you like them.

50:22.150 --> 50:24.550
This one-those little dogs,
they are adorable.

50:29.023 --> 50:31.014
Yes. I raised those puppies myself.

50:33.093 --> 50:35.493
I can hardly believe it, Capitaine.

50:35.562 --> 50:38.827
With all these lovely women,
do you really care for me?

50:38.899 --> 50:42.198
My angel, I cannot tell you
what you do to me.

50:42.269 --> 50:45.102
Just looking at you is like a tonic.

50:45.172 --> 50:47.663
Yes, Capitaine Duran. You and I.

50:47.741 --> 50:51.768
- Our vengeance will really be sweet.
- Darling.

50:51.845 --> 50:54.837
- What was that for?
- You pig! I knew it was you all the time.

50:54.915 --> 50:57.475
You did, huh? You did not.
You thought I was Duran.

50:57.551 --> 50:59.883
And you thought they were puppies.
Well, take a look.

50:59.953 --> 51:01.944
They are horses.
Horses as big as a house.

51:02.022 --> 51:04.957
You thought you were going places. You
came here to throw yourself into his arms.

51:05.025 --> 51:07.425
What are you doing here?
You came here because of that woman.

51:07.494 --> 51:09.826
- She doesn't even know who I am.
- You don't fool me.

51:09.897 --> 51:14.334
- You don't care about me anymore.
- Stop screaming and listen to me!

51:14.401 --> 51:16.892
They're paying me a half
a million francs for this.

51:16.970 --> 51:19.370
And who am I gonna spend it on? You.

51:19.440 --> 51:21.431
- Half of a million francs?
- Yes.

51:21.508 --> 51:25.672
Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Television.

51:25.746 --> 51:28.544
- Jack, the television.
- What television?

51:28.615 --> 51:31.379
Gapeaux made arrangements for you to be on
television tonight and you're not there.

51:31.452 --> 51:34.786
- Why didn't he tell me? - It all happened
today. He has been looking for you.

51:34.856 --> 51:38.417
Jack, he's furious. He said if you're
not there, you'll never work again.

51:38.493 --> 51:41.553
Oh, it was the chance
of a lifetime too.

51:41.629 --> 51:43.563
- I'll make it.
- But how?

51:43.631 --> 51:45.690
I'll get there somehow.
You go back to the theater.

51:45.767 --> 51:48.031
Tell Gapeaux I'll be there,
not to cancel the show.

51:48.103 --> 51:51.698
- If necessary, you go on first. You better go
out this way. - All right, baby, but hurry.

51:51.773 --> 51:55.436
- I will. I'll get there as quick as I can.
- Kiss me.

51:55.510 --> 51:59.276
- I would still like to meet this Capitaine Duran.
- Oh, come on.

52:10.625 --> 52:14.391
- Ah, Henri. I have caught you at last.
- Uh, caught me?

52:14.462 --> 52:16.828
Yes, I thought perhaps
if we could step into the library...

52:16.898 --> 52:19.560
we might have our
little business talk now.

52:19.634 --> 52:22.967
Business talk at a party?
Oh, Felix, you surprise me.

52:23.037 --> 52:26.734
Look, my friend. It is not that important.
We will talk tomorrow.

52:26.808 --> 52:30.642
Not important? Henri, sometimes
I do not understand you.

52:30.712 --> 52:34.876
Hmm. Now, Felix,
if you will excuse me, I must see Lili.

52:36.718 --> 52:39.983
At the casino, really?
Oh, please sit down.

52:40.054 --> 52:42.147
With your luck, I can understand it.

52:42.223 --> 52:45.818
- Pardon. Lili, may I speak with you for a moment?
- Of course.

52:45.894 --> 52:48.089
- You will excuse us?
- Excuse me.

52:48.163 --> 52:50.324
Henri, what is it?
Is anything wrong?

52:50.398 --> 52:53.993
No, no, my dear. It's just that, well,
you may not see me for a little while.

52:54.068 --> 52:57.003
- Why not?
- Felix persists in talking business.

52:57.071 --> 52:59.437
- And you want to keep out of his way?
- Exactly.

53:36.478 --> 53:39.379
And remember,
you promised me another dance.

53:39.448 --> 53:41.439
I'll be waiting.

53:47.723 --> 53:50.123
Henri.

53:51.293 --> 53:53.523
Oh, Henri, I have missed you so.

53:53.596 --> 53:57.498
- I-I've missed you too.
- Where can we go?

53:57.566 --> 54:01.559
Uh, well, really, just now
I cannot go anyplace. I-I have to leave-

54:01.637 --> 54:05.835
- You are putting me off. I can hear it in your voice.
- You-You can?

54:05.908 --> 54:08.604
You are not going to drop me
like you dropped all the others.

54:08.677 --> 54:11.544
- No?
- No, not after all the promises you made.

54:11.614 --> 54:15.607
Oh. Well, I promise to keep
those promises, every one.

54:15.684 --> 54:18.445
- But later. Really, right now I must
be leaving at once. - But, Henri.

54:18.487 --> 54:21.581
I will be back.
You wait for me right here.

54:21.657 --> 54:23.648
Will you? Hmm?

54:26.295 --> 54:28.354
What a man.

54:29.431 --> 54:31.490
Where does he find the time?

55:10.807 --> 55:13.241
Ah, where is Henri?

55:13.310 --> 55:16.837
Henri? I saw him a moment ago.
He is with Lili, I suppose.

55:16.913 --> 55:20.110
- Dancing, drinking, enjoying himself.
- He's not with Lili.

55:20.183 --> 55:22.515
Oh, well, you know Henri.

55:22.585 --> 55:24.917
He may be busy elsewhere.

55:24.988 --> 55:27.513
You all seem to be
in very good spirits this evening.

55:27.590 --> 55:31.117
- And why not?
- Yes. Is this not an occasion to be gay?

55:31.194 --> 55:34.652
Perhaps. And perhaps it is just
a front for my benefit.

55:34.731 --> 55:36.756
Oh, nonsense.

55:36.833 --> 55:39.961
- Then why is Henri afraid to talk to me?
- Afraid?

55:40.036 --> 55:44.200
- Ridiculous. - Oh, Felix, Madame
Cornet wants to see the television.

55:44.274 --> 55:46.299
Yes, that actor at
the Cote d'Azur is on.

55:46.376 --> 55:48.674
The one who does
the marvelous imitation of Henri.

55:48.745 --> 55:51.805
- He is supposed to be on now?
- Yes, I read it in the Eclaireur.

55:51.881 --> 55:54.111
- This is not possible.
- Why not?

55:54.184 --> 55:56.846
Of course it is possible.
He could be wrong.

55:56.920 --> 55:59.718
- But he is very bad.
- I hear he's excellent.

55:59.789 --> 56:01.882
Who could have told you that?
He is terrible.

56:01.958 --> 56:06.258
Well, I want to see him anyway.
Come along, Felix, or we will miss it.

56:09.466 --> 56:12.629
- What are we going to do?
- Why worry? How can there be a show?

56:12.702 --> 56:15.068
Martin cannot be
in two places at once.

56:15.138 --> 56:19.302
But if Periton finds out that Martin is not at
the theater, he'll put two and two together.

56:19.376 --> 56:21.401
- He is no fool.
- He's not that clever.

56:21.478 --> 56:25.245
What do you mean, "He's not that clever"?
Who has all the money, you or he?

56:25.316 --> 56:27.876
He. You are right.
We must stop them.

56:27.952 --> 56:30.887
That cannot be the right station.

56:30.955 --> 56:35.187
- Try another.
- No, no. That boy is magnificent. Leave it on.

56:35.259 --> 56:38.490
I've been reading
about this child. He is a genius.

56:38.562 --> 56:41.895
Yes, the greatest
violinist since Paganini.

56:49.140 --> 56:52.075
That may be. But to me, he's terrible.
Let me get the right station-

56:52.143 --> 56:55.704
Please, I'll do it. These things, you know,
they are very complicated.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.771
Allow me.

57:00.084 --> 57:04.783
This special program from the stage
of the Cote d'Azur of Monte Carlo.

57:04.855 --> 57:07.016
There you are.

59:55.695 --> 59:57.959
Moo. Oink.

01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:07.628
Very good. But I thought
Henri was going to-

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:12.296
- Where is Henri?
- Shh. He's going to do Henri now.

01:01:12.438 --> 01:01:15.703
- So, he fooled everyone, did he?
- Yes, but what about you, Henri?

01:01:15.776 --> 01:01:17.971
Did you see Sir Hubert?

01:01:18.045 --> 01:01:22.038
I went only as far as Paris. I called him
on the telephone while we were refueling.

01:01:22.115 --> 01:01:25.278
He knew what I wanted.
Periton had seen to that.

01:01:25.352 --> 01:01:28.378
He was polite, but he said
it was impossible to see me.

01:01:28.455 --> 01:01:30.480
So I turned around and flew back.

01:01:30.557 --> 01:01:32.855
What are you going to say to Felix?

01:01:32.926 --> 01:01:38.159
That depends entirely on what Felix has
to say to me. He has the upper hand now.

01:01:38.231 --> 01:01:42.793
- By the way, did Lili know it was Martin?
- Of course.

01:01:42.869 --> 01:01:48.034
- She has been an angel. Such a display of affection.
- Such a performance.

01:01:48.108 --> 01:01:50.235
You're certain it was a performance?

01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:52.335
Oh, Henri, that is
not important now.

01:01:52.412 --> 01:01:56.178
You must think of Periton.
He has been trying to see you all evening.

01:01:56.249 --> 01:01:58.342
Very well, I will speak to him.

01:01:58.418 --> 01:02:02.514
But I'm afraid that all I can do
is plead for more time.

01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:08.318
- I think, Louis, that we have come to-
- To the end of our rope.

01:02:09.963 --> 01:02:13.763
Why, Henri. You didn't disappear
for so long after all.

01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:16.860
- Lili.
- Henri.

01:02:16.937 --> 01:02:19.337
You've been so
affectionate this evening.

01:02:19.406 --> 01:02:22.773
- Have I?
- Yes. Just like a schoolboy with his first crush.

01:02:22.843 --> 01:02:25.539
- Oh.
- But I like it.

01:02:25.612 --> 01:02:30.879
Hmm, may I say, Lili,
that you are looking very lovely tonight?

01:02:30.951 --> 01:02:35.115
- Or have I said that before?
- Several times.

01:02:35.188 --> 01:02:38.351
Now come along. You promised to dance
with me again, remember?

01:02:38.425 --> 01:02:40.484
Yes, I forgot.

01:02:44.197 --> 01:02:48.099
- Hi.
- Jack, wait a minute.

01:02:48.168 --> 01:02:50.693
- Where are you going?
- I have to get back to the party.

01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:53.036
No, you're not going
back to that woman!

01:02:53.107 --> 01:02:55.632
- Well, I've gotta finish the job.
- It's not the job.

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:58.042
- You're going back because of her.
- Oh, Colette.

01:02:58.112 --> 01:03:00.239
You told me yourself
she was beautiful.

01:03:00.314 --> 01:03:03.750
Everybody knows her husband doesn't
even look at her. So now she wants you, eh?

01:03:03.818 --> 01:03:07.151
- Now don't you talk that way
about her. She's a lady. - Oh!

01:03:07.221 --> 01:03:09.246
- And I'm not.
- Nobody said you weren't.

01:03:09.323 --> 01:03:11.723
It's true. You've really fallen
in love with her.

01:03:11.793 --> 01:03:13.127
Colette, don't be silly.
I'll see you tomorrow morning at rehearsal.

01:03:13.128 --> 01:03:14.925
Colette, don't be silly.
I'll see you tomorrow morning at rehearsal.

01:03:14.996 --> 01:03:19.262
If you go back to that woman, you'll never see
me at rehearsal tomorrow morning or ever again.

01:03:19.334 --> 01:03:21.325
- Would you stop-
- I mean it!

01:03:26.307 --> 01:03:28.775
Close the door.
Nothing but champagne.

01:03:28.843 --> 01:03:31.277
If I don't have a real
drink, I will go crazy.

01:03:31.346 --> 01:03:33.337
I think I will go crazy anyway.

01:03:33.414 --> 01:03:36.349
Fix me one too, a stiff one.

01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:38.817
Gentlemen, I am leaving.

01:03:38.887 --> 01:03:41.151
- Leaving?
- But Felix, why?

01:03:41.222 --> 01:03:43.622
I have found out
what I wanted to know.

01:03:43.691 --> 01:03:45.682
- But you have not talked with Henri.
- Exactly.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.526
He continues to avoid me. And why?
Because he has failed to get the money.

01:03:49.597 --> 01:03:51.622
- That is why.
- You're jumping to conclusions.

01:03:51.699 --> 01:03:54.634
- That is not true at all.
- Just wait here. We will get Henri.

01:03:54.702 --> 01:03:56.795
- He will convince you.
- Can we fix you a drink?

01:03:56.871 --> 01:03:59.135
- I do not want a drink.
- Please, Felix, relax.

01:03:59.207 --> 01:04:01.141
I will wait exactly one minute.

01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:03.143
- We will get Henri.
- Right away.

01:04:03.211 --> 01:04:05.145
- Relax.
- Don't go away.

01:04:10.885 --> 01:04:12.876
Have you seen Felix?
I've been looking everywhere-

01:04:12.954 --> 01:04:14.979
- He is in the library.
- He is very disturbed.

01:04:15.056 --> 01:04:18.548
- If he does not see you at once, he
threatens to leave. - Just a moment.

01:04:18.626 --> 01:04:20.821
- Has something happened that
I do not know about? - No.

01:04:20.895 --> 01:04:23.989
- Why? - If he holds all the trump
cards, why does he not leave?

01:04:24.065 --> 01:04:26.056
Why does he have to see me?

01:04:26.134 --> 01:04:28.864
There must be something to our advantage
that we do not know about.

01:04:28.937 --> 01:04:32.897
- What?
- I do not know. But I shall behave as if I do.

01:04:32.975 --> 01:04:38.743
And you two, stay away. One look
at your faces, and our credit will be zero.

01:04:38.814 --> 01:04:41.009
Credit-What is it now?

01:04:42.318 --> 01:04:45.048
Ah, Felix, I'm sorry
to have neglected you.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.179
What is it you wish to see me about?

01:04:47.256 --> 01:04:51.192
- Henri, you astonish me. Such confidence.
- Why not?

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:55.924
Because I have you blocked at every turn.
You are entirely at my mercy.

01:04:55.998 --> 01:04:58.432
I know everything there is
to know about you.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.731
That telephone call.

01:05:01.804 --> 01:05:05.399
Which one, Felix?
I receive so many, you know.

01:05:05.474 --> 01:05:08.671
The one from the air ministry.
What did they want?

01:05:08.744 --> 01:05:12.180
You surprise me. Really, Felix.

01:05:12.248 --> 01:05:15.376
I thought you knew everything
there is to know about me.

01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:18.113
- Henri, we have been friends for many years.
- Yes.

01:05:18.187 --> 01:05:20.781
Tell me what
the air ministry offered.

01:05:20.856 --> 01:05:22.881
I'm afraid I cannot do that, Felix.

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:25.051
Then I'll call them
myself and find out.

01:05:25.127 --> 01:05:27.118
You do that, and all
negotiations are off.

01:05:27.196 --> 01:05:29.357
Now, Henri, let us not be too hasty.

01:05:29.431 --> 01:05:34.300
I, hasty? Who sent a telegram canceling
Air Europa's contract for our planes?

01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:38.363
- My telegram canceled nothing.
- Well, that is hardly debatable, Felix.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.568
It is a simple matter of record.
I have the telegram right in my office.

01:05:41.644 --> 01:05:44.044
I would certainly like
to see such a telegram.

01:05:44.113 --> 01:05:47.207
I'll be very happy to get it
and show it to you.

01:06:17.514 --> 01:06:20.244
- Oh, Capitaine.
- Yes, Antoine?

01:06:20.317 --> 01:06:24.344
That young lady you told to wait
on the terrace- - What? Oh, yes.

01:06:24.421 --> 01:06:26.685
No, sir. She's no longer there.

01:06:26.756 --> 01:06:31.955
She became quite impatient, so I put her in
the upstairs sitting room. She is furious.

01:06:32.028 --> 01:06:35.020
Ah. Well, uh, you speak to her.

01:06:35.098 --> 01:06:37.123
I'm afraid that would
do no good, Capitaine.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.430
If I may say so,
once they have met you...

01:06:39.502 --> 01:06:41.493
it seems to spoil them
for anyone else.

01:06:41.571 --> 01:06:43.835
I suppose that is true.

01:06:43.907 --> 01:06:46.603
- Very well, I will see her.
- Thank you, Capitaine.

01:06:50.246 --> 01:06:53.181
Oh, Henri.
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

01:06:53.249 --> 01:06:55.274
We will forget about the telegram.

01:06:55.352 --> 01:06:58.321
- And we will talk things over like friends.
- Yes, but, uh-

01:06:58.388 --> 01:07:00.879
I know, I know.
I perhaps did say that in the telegram.

01:07:00.957 --> 01:07:04.688
But it is of no consequence at all.

01:07:09.933 --> 01:07:12.231
Henri, you do not understand me.

01:07:12.302 --> 01:07:15.533
- And I do not understand you.
- What could be fairer than that?

01:07:15.605 --> 01:07:19.701
But you are acting so strangely.
I'm beginning to think you do not care.

01:07:24.147 --> 01:07:26.638
- There is no need to worry.
- Henri will be-

01:07:28.385 --> 01:07:31.821
Look, that actor. He's back.

01:07:31.888 --> 01:07:34.584
- Oh, if Periton sees him-
- It will spoil everything.

01:07:34.657 --> 01:07:36.750
We've got to get him out of here.

01:07:39.929 --> 01:07:42.022
- What are you doing? Go away.
- Far away.

01:07:42.098 --> 01:07:44.829
- What is the matter with you?
- We do not need you any longer.

01:07:44.902 --> 01:07:47.496
- Duran is back.
- Duran, Duran. I am Duran.

01:07:47.571 --> 01:07:51.530
- You're- - Certainly. I do not
know how, but Martin is in there.

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:54.703
- Martin? But he's at the theater.
- I tell you he is in there.

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:56.770
Then you cannot stay here, Henri.

01:07:56.847 --> 01:07:59.577
Where shall I go,
to his nightclub and do his act?

01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:02.414
It will be all right
if you two go into the office.

01:08:02.486 --> 01:08:06.354
- "It will be all right." - Do not worry.
He has been told not to commit himself.

01:08:06.424 --> 01:08:09.791
I will wait out here.

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.091
- Hmm.
- Will you please stop doing that?

01:08:13.164 --> 01:08:16.564
It is driving me mad. Say something.

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:19.194
- Felix.
- Yes?

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:22.728
Have a cigar.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:26.573
Bonbons. I never know where anything is
in this house anymore.

01:08:26.644 --> 01:08:30.375
Oh, please, Henri. Let's come down to
business. What about the telephone?

01:08:30.448 --> 01:08:32.746
- Telephone?
- Yes, the telephone.

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:35.752
- Felix, I have a confession to make.
- Ah.

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:38.880
I do not know where
the telephone is either.

01:08:38.956 --> 01:08:41.754
Always redecorating.
Always something new.

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:43.817
I go around the world in two days.

01:08:43.894 --> 01:08:47.125
I arrive back, Lili
has changed everything.

01:08:47.198 --> 01:08:51.600
Henri, something has happened to you.
Your trip-you should take a vacation.

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:54.832
Really, Felix? Where do you think
I should go at this time of year?

01:08:54.904 --> 01:08:58.102
Well, at this time of year,
I think a cruise on your boat would be-

01:08:58.175 --> 01:09:00.166
How did we come to talk about this?

01:09:00.243 --> 01:09:04.510
How did we come
to talk about this? Let me see.

01:09:04.582 --> 01:09:08.018
I was doing this and you said I should
stop because it was driving you crazy.

01:09:08.085 --> 01:09:10.814
Then I offered you a cigar,
but it turned out to be bonbons.

01:09:10.888 --> 01:09:13.287
I said, "I never know where anything
is in this house anymore."

01:09:13.357 --> 01:09:15.325
You said, "What about the telephone?"
I said, "I do not know"-

01:09:15.392 --> 01:09:19.294
All right, Henri. I see your game.
You're fencing for time.

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:22.197
- So?
- You do not wish to make a deal tonight...

01:09:22.267 --> 01:09:26.430
because tomorrow, you will make a better deal
with the air ministry, is that not true?

01:09:26.505 --> 01:09:29.269
Hmm.

01:09:29.341 --> 01:09:31.332
I wish I knew
what you are thinking.

01:09:31.408 --> 01:09:34.776
But I cannot afford to take a chance.
Air Europa must have those planes.

01:09:34.845 --> 01:09:38.042
My first and last offer,
20 billion francs.

01:09:38.116 --> 01:09:40.140
- 20 billion-
- Shh.

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:43.984
- 20 billion francs.
- Hmm.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:47.616
Very well, then. 25 billion.

01:09:47.692 --> 01:09:49.990
Hmm.

01:09:51.696 --> 01:09:54.290
- What has happened?
- I do not know. They are still in there.

01:09:54.366 --> 01:09:56.391
Stay inside. I will let you know.

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:10.211
I have to find my wife.

01:10:16.788 --> 01:10:19.313
- What did he say?
- He said he had to find his wife.

01:10:19.391 --> 01:10:22.724
- No. What did he say in there?
- I don't know. I think that guy is wacky.

01:10:22.794 --> 01:10:24.819
And I'm not so sure
about you either.

01:10:24.896 --> 01:10:27.694
- You must go away from here at
once. Duran has returned. - He has?

01:10:27.766 --> 01:10:30.257
Yes. Here's the rest of your money.
Go out through the library.

01:10:30.335 --> 01:10:32.360
Wait a minute.
What about my clothes upstairs?

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:36.168
You can get everything tomorrow,
but go, please, and quick.

01:10:43.915 --> 01:10:47.681
- Our friend has finally gone.
- Good. What has happened?

01:10:47.752 --> 01:10:52.416
- I don't know nothing. I think this Martin is wacky.
- At least he is gone.

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:55.220
If I only knew what I said in there,
I'd be much happier.

01:10:58.964 --> 01:11:01.661
Mimi, I'm delighted-

01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:07.769
Oh, this Martin.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.866
Mimi has never slapped anybody before.

01:11:10.943 --> 01:11:14.003
Perhaps he should have
paid us for tonight's work.

01:11:15.982 --> 01:11:18.576
- Good night, Henri.
- Good night, Madeleine.

01:11:18.651 --> 01:11:20.642
- Lovely evening.
- Thank you. Felix.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.745
I meant every word I said, Henri.

01:11:22.822 --> 01:11:25.757
And when I see you tomorrow,
I will prove it to you. Good night.

01:11:25.825 --> 01:11:28.293
- Good night, Felix.
- Good night, gentlemen.

01:11:28.361 --> 01:11:30.921
Good night.

01:11:30.997 --> 01:11:33.329
See me tomorrow?
What did he mean by that?

01:11:33.399 --> 01:11:35.424
- Just what he said.
- He will see you tomorrow.

01:11:35.501 --> 01:11:37.765
Ah, no. There was
something underneath it.

01:11:37.837 --> 01:11:39.930
Do you think that Martin
gave the whole thing away?

01:11:40.006 --> 01:11:42.236
How could he?
He did not know anything.

01:11:42.308 --> 01:11:45.835
- He knew how to fascinate Lili.
- He certainly did.

01:11:45.911 --> 01:11:48.277
You, uh, have not
told Lili I am back?

01:11:48.347 --> 01:11:51.248
No, you are still in London
as far as she's concerned.

01:11:51.317 --> 01:11:54.650
Then I am still in London
as far as you are concerned.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.814
I think I will be Monsieur Martin till
the party is over...

01:11:57.890 --> 01:12:00.586
and even afterwards perhaps.

01:12:16.008 --> 01:12:20.536
- It must be very bad.
- Asking us to rush out to the boat like this.

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:27.041
Yes?

01:12:28.353 --> 01:12:30.844
- Bad news?
- From Periton?

01:12:30.923 --> 01:12:33.357
- Something far more tragic.
- More tragic?

01:12:33.425 --> 01:12:36.189
- Good heavens. What?
- I have lost everything.

01:12:36.261 --> 01:12:40.289
- Tell us, Henri. Tell us.
- It's Lili. She has betrayed me.

01:12:40.366 --> 01:12:43.494
- Last night she was in the arms of another man.
- Oh, I don't believe it.

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:47.165
- How do you know?
- How do I know? I was there.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.801
- You mean you actually-
- Yes. I wish I could say no.

01:12:50.877 --> 01:12:55.473
- Poor Henri. Who was the man?
- I was.

01:12:55.548 --> 01:12:59.245
- Perhaps we did not understand.
- Of course not. How could you understand?

01:12:59.319 --> 01:13:01.810
You cannot imagine
such an experience.

01:13:01.888 --> 01:13:03.879
Last night I went to her room.

01:13:03.957 --> 01:13:06.892
I took her in my arms
and kissed her tenderly...

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.360
hoping against hope
she would rebuff me.

01:13:09.429 --> 01:13:14.833
But she did not. She kissed me eagerly,
fiercely. It was horrible.

01:13:14.901 --> 01:13:17.426
- What's horrible about a wife kissing-
- Her own husband?

01:13:17.503 --> 01:13:21.769
She was not kissing her husband. She thought I
was Martin. She thought she was kissing him.

01:13:21.841 --> 01:13:24.207
But she wasn't kissing him.
She was kissing you.

01:13:24.277 --> 01:13:27.713
- So she was the one who was fooled.
- That is not the point.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.681
Last night, with him-with me-

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:34.777
she was a completely different woman
than she ever was with me.

01:13:34.854 --> 01:13:37.846
I've been such a fool.

01:13:37.924 --> 01:13:41.189
I never realized how
wonderful she is until now.

01:13:41.261 --> 01:13:44.526
Now it is too late.
She's in love with that actor.

01:13:44.597 --> 01:13:47.225
There's nothing I can do about it.

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.929
I cannot even blame Martin for what
he did, because he did not do it.

01:13:51.004 --> 01:13:53.029
I did it myself.

01:13:53.106 --> 01:13:56.234
You have certainly placed yourself
in an embarrassing position.

01:13:56.309 --> 01:13:59.301
It's horrible.
That's why I sent for you.

01:13:59.379 --> 01:14:05.215
I cannot go back to the villa. I-I could
not face her. I'm sailing in an hour.

01:14:05.285 --> 01:14:07.776
- But what about our company?
- What about Periton?

01:14:07.854 --> 01:14:13.053
That is your affair.
I am no longer interested in anything.

01:14:13.126 --> 01:14:16.585
Oh, Henri. It is impossible. I do not
believe Lili would do such a thing.

01:14:16.664 --> 01:14:20.293
- Why not? - Every man in France has
tried to make love to Lili and failed.

01:14:20.367 --> 01:14:22.562
There was never any other
man for Lili but you.

01:14:22.636 --> 01:14:24.831
She knew it was you last night.
All the time.

01:14:24.905 --> 01:14:27.806
Of course she did.
She just wanted to teach you a lesson.

01:14:27.875 --> 01:14:29.900
You think so?

01:14:29.977 --> 01:14:32.639
- Knowing Lili, it is obvious.
- Think about it.

01:14:35.215 --> 01:14:37.240
I wonder.

01:14:37.318 --> 01:14:39.843
She did act rather
strangely last night.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.289
At first, uh, she was quite angry.
Then suddenly, she changed.

01:14:44.358 --> 01:14:47.486
- That was the moment she discovered it was you.
- Definitely.

01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:50.291
Right now, she's probably
laughing her head off.

01:14:50.364 --> 01:14:55.097
- And I have been worrying about nothing.
- Of course.

01:14:55.169 --> 01:14:58.195
Then perhaps it is time
I gave her something to worry about.

01:14:58.272 --> 01:15:01.799
- Come, my friends. I will telephone to shore.
- What for?

01:15:01.942 --> 01:15:04.934
First I shall call
the airport, then my wife.

01:15:16.457 --> 01:15:19.358
Come in.

01:15:21.261 --> 01:15:25.493
- Good morning, madame.
- Good morning, Antoine. Isn't it a lovely day?

01:15:25.566 --> 01:15:28.296
Yes, madame. The capitaine would like
to speak with you.

01:15:28.369 --> 01:15:31.236
- Why doesn't he come in?
- He's on the telephone, madame.

01:15:31.305 --> 01:15:34.570
The telephone?
Here. Take this, Antoine.

01:15:37.411 --> 01:15:39.470
Hello, Henri.

01:15:39.546 --> 01:15:43.004
You might at least have come in and said
good morning to me before you left.

01:15:43.083 --> 01:15:47.042
- Where are you anyway?
- I'm here at the airport, my dear.

01:15:47.121 --> 01:15:49.919
I'm sorry I could not get home
for the reception last night...

01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:52.858
but, uh, we ran into bad weather
and we were forced down.

01:15:52.927 --> 01:15:57.159
You mean you've just arrived?
You weren't at home last night?

01:15:57.232 --> 01:16:01.032
No, of course not, my dear.
Why? Did something happen?

01:16:01.102 --> 01:16:05.664
Oh, no, Henri.
No, nothing happened, nothing at all.

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:07.731
Didn't you sleep well?

01:16:07.809 --> 01:16:12.439
Oh, yes, I-I didn't
even take a pill. Oh, my.

01:16:12.514 --> 01:16:14.448
You sound upset, my dear.

01:16:14.516 --> 01:16:16.882
Oh, no, Henri. It's nothing.

01:16:16.951 --> 01:16:19.283
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

01:16:19.354 --> 01:16:21.447
I will be home in a little while.

01:16:21.523 --> 01:16:24.048
Good-bye, my dear.

01:16:27.595 --> 01:16:31.326
Oh, no. It-It couldn't have been.

01:16:44.045 --> 01:16:46.411
Madame?

01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:49.279
Michele, ask Antoine to come in,
please. Quickly.

01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:51.477
Yes, madame.

01:17:11.706 --> 01:17:14.504
Hello. Is this the airport?

01:17:14.576 --> 01:17:16.976
Control tower, please.

01:17:17.045 --> 01:17:19.240
Hello, this is Madame Duran.

01:17:19.314 --> 01:17:21.942
Would you please tell me
what time Capitaine Duran's plane landed?

01:17:22.016 --> 01:17:25.850
Just a minute, madame. It's Duran's wife.
She's checking up on him.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:31.188
- What will I tell her? - Duran told us to
say his plane got in this morning at 11:28.

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:33.455
Where do you suppose
he spent the night?

01:17:33.529 --> 01:17:35.656
Hello, madame?

01:17:35.731 --> 01:17:39.292
According to our records, Capitaine Duran's
plane landed at 11:28 this morning.

01:17:39.368 --> 01:17:43.327
This morning? Are you sure?

01:17:45.407 --> 01:17:49.673
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:17:52.014 --> 01:17:56.974
- Madame wishes to see me? - Yes, Antoine.
Did you see Capitaine Duran this morning?

01:17:57.052 --> 01:17:59.145
Of course, madame.
I laid out his clothes, as usual.

01:17:59.221 --> 01:18:01.849
Did you notice anything-
anything different about him?

01:18:01.924 --> 01:18:04.154
I mean, did he act
strangely in any way?

01:18:04.226 --> 01:18:06.456
If you please, madame.
I would rather not discuss it.

01:18:06.529 --> 01:18:09.828
- Oh, but you must. What happened?
- Very well, madame.

01:18:09.899 --> 01:18:11.890
I've been in service for many years.

01:18:11.967 --> 01:18:14.026
Now, I don't look down
upon my position.

01:18:14.103 --> 01:18:16.571
I consider it an honorable
and dignified calling.

01:18:16.639 --> 01:18:19.472
If more people took their jobs
as seriously as I do...

01:18:19.542 --> 01:18:22.511
the world wouldn't be
in the hideous mess it's in today.

01:18:22.578 --> 01:18:25.342
Yes, yes, Antoine.
What did the capitaine do?

01:18:25.414 --> 01:18:27.746
He was extraordinarily rude to me.

01:18:27.816 --> 01:18:30.751
He didn't shower. He didn't shave.
He didn't eat his breakfast.

01:18:30.819 --> 01:18:33.913
And to top it all, he completely
disregarded my selection...

01:18:33.989 --> 01:18:37.083
and left wearing a blue suit
with a green tie.

01:18:37.159 --> 01:18:39.593
Why, I shall be
the laughingstock of the Riviera.

01:18:39.662 --> 01:18:42.495
I've never known the capitaine
to behave in this fashion before.

01:18:42.565 --> 01:18:47.366
- Oh.
- It was almost as if he were another man.

01:18:47.436 --> 01:18:50.064
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, Antoine.

01:18:50.139 --> 01:18:53.836
So am I, madame. But it's a situation
for which there's no solution.

01:18:53.909 --> 01:18:56.844
If he apologizes, it will destroy our
relationship completely.

01:18:56.912 --> 01:18:59.710
Then I would have to leave.
Will that be all, madame?

01:18:59.782 --> 01:19:01.773
Yes, yes, Antoine. Thank you.

01:19:07.157 --> 01:19:09.523
By now, she has
telephoned the airport.

01:19:09.593 --> 01:19:12.528
- I will give her five minutes more.
- But Periton.

01:19:12.596 --> 01:19:17.090
They have verified my story, and the
horrible truth is beginning to dawn on her.

01:19:17.167 --> 01:19:20.102
Don't you think we ought to find out
what Periton is going to do?

01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:22.195
She has called in
Michele and Antoine...

01:19:22.272 --> 01:19:25.105
and they have confirmed
her worst fears.

01:19:25.175 --> 01:19:27.643
There's no longer
room for any doubt.

01:19:27.711 --> 01:19:30.111
She can barely face the realization
of what she has done.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:32.910
But, Henri- - It will take me
about half an hour to get ashore...

01:19:32.983 --> 01:19:35.383
and drive up to the villa.

01:19:35.452 --> 01:19:37.886
The bad news.

01:19:37.954 --> 01:19:40.081
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

01:19:40.156 --> 01:19:43.648
I'm glad I found all three of you together.
I've been looking for you all morning.

01:19:43.727 --> 01:19:47.094
- Well, you have found us. - They told
me at the club you had come out here.

01:19:47.163 --> 01:19:49.154
I was afraid you'd sail
without my seeing you.

01:19:49.232 --> 01:19:51.257
Perhaps that would
have been just as well.

01:19:51.334 --> 01:19:53.325
One would almost think
you did not want to see me.

01:19:53.403 --> 01:19:56.736
- Well, did we?
- Didn't you tell them?

01:19:56.806 --> 01:20:00.503
- What was there to tell?
- About our conference last night, of course.

01:20:00.577 --> 01:20:03.273
Oh, yes, of course I told them.

01:20:03.346 --> 01:20:07.646
- And you told them the terms?
- Mmm, yes, in a general way.

01:20:07.717 --> 01:20:11.153
- Then why are they acting so gloomy?
- Why, indeed?

01:20:11.221 --> 01:20:15.487
- You do not act very cheerful yourself.
- Cheerful? Why should I?

01:20:15.558 --> 01:20:17.685
Oh, Henri, you're an amazing man.

01:20:17.761 --> 01:20:21.857
I bring you a check for 30 billion
francs- - 30 billion francs?

01:20:21.931 --> 01:20:25.128
- You sound surprised.
- Well, I am.

01:20:25.201 --> 01:20:28.693
I, uh-I am surprised
that you got it so quickly.

01:20:28.772 --> 01:20:32.970
I'm a man of my word. I told you last night
I would bring you the check this morning.

01:20:33.043 --> 01:20:35.511
- And there it is.
- Yes, there it is.

01:20:35.578 --> 01:20:39.014
I have always said you had the shrewdest
business mind in Europe, Henri.

01:20:39.082 --> 01:20:42.279
- Last night, you proved it.
- You give me too much credit, Felix.

01:20:42.352 --> 01:20:47.950
- No, you held a trump card, and you played it
like a master. - Thank you very much, Felix.

01:20:48.025 --> 01:20:51.552
I'm sorry I cannot ask you to stay,
but Lili is not feeling very well just now.

01:20:51.629 --> 01:20:55.622
- I must get back to the villa. - I'm sorry to
hear that. I'll take you back in my launch.

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:59.261
- That's very kind of you, Felix. I'll
be with you in a minute. - Gentlemen.

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:04.531
30 billion francs!

01:21:04.608 --> 01:21:07.236
We are saved!
We are solvent! We are rich!

01:21:07.311 --> 01:21:10.678
- Thanks to Monsieur Martin.
- Yes.

01:21:10.748 --> 01:21:14.912
He seems to have played my part
almost as well as I have played his.

01:21:40.478 --> 01:21:43.709
- Oh, good morning.
- What are you doing here?

01:21:43.781 --> 01:21:47.080
- Came to get my clothes.
- How did you get in?

01:21:47.151 --> 01:21:50.518
Sneaked in through the library.
Oh, don't worry. Nobody saw me.

01:21:50.588 --> 01:21:53.785
- I'm surprised you have the gall to face me.
- Why not?

01:21:53.858 --> 01:21:57.555
What you did last night was utterly contemptible.
You knew I thought you were my husband.

01:21:57.628 --> 01:22:01.860
- Sure, I did. We had a lot of fun, didn't we?
- Fun?

01:22:01.932 --> 01:22:04.628
Yeah. You know, I wasn't
too keen about it at first.

01:22:04.702 --> 01:22:07.227
But when I realized the situation,
you know, with the captain gone...

01:22:07.304 --> 01:22:09.465
- and how desperate you were.
- Really?

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:12.134
- Oh, I'm not saying I can't use the money.
- Oh.

01:22:12.209 --> 01:22:16.043
- And I was wondering if I could ask you a favor.
- What kind of a favor?

01:22:16.113 --> 01:22:20.072
Well, if it isn't too much trouble,
I'd like a letter of recommendation.

01:22:20.151 --> 01:22:22.586
- Recommendation? After what you did?
- Yeah.

01:22:22.654 --> 01:22:25.748
What's the matter with what I did?
Didn't you like my performance?

01:22:25.824 --> 01:22:29.988
- I certainly did not. - Well, I'd like
to know anyone who could've done better.

01:22:30.061 --> 01:22:33.497
- Oh, you vulgar, insufferable-
- Wait a minute.

01:22:33.565 --> 01:22:36.432
If you weren't satisfied,
why didn't you tell me before this?

01:22:36.501 --> 01:22:39.061
Because your performance
was too good.

01:22:39.137 --> 01:22:41.765
I don't mind saying you gave a pretty good
performance yourself.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.933
Will you get out of here,
you conceited-

01:22:44.009 --> 01:22:47.740
It's not conceit. I did a good job last
night. And I'm proud of it. That's all.

01:22:47.813 --> 01:22:51.146
I just thought you might know some other
homes where I could do the same thing.

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:53.776
- My charges would be very reasonable.
- Monsieur Martin.

01:22:53.852 --> 01:22:56.343
- I must ask you to leave.
- Okay.

01:22:56.421 --> 01:22:59.151
But if the captain's ever away again,
I'll be very happy to oblige.

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.784
Is that why you came here?
To make cheap, disgusting-

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.488
No, I told you why I came.
I came to get my clothes.

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:07.157
Why didn't you take them
when you left this morning?

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:09.757
- What? - Why didn't you take your
clothes when you left this morning?

01:23:09.835 --> 01:23:13.327
Left this morning? I left last night.

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:17.205
- You left last night?
- Sure. Soon as I found out the captain was back...

01:23:17.275 --> 01:23:19.641
I beat it out of here
as fast as I could.

01:23:19.711 --> 01:23:21.712
Then the capitaine
was here last night.

01:23:21.845 --> 01:23:25.508
- Sure, he was. Didn't you see him?
- Oh, yes.

01:23:26.683 --> 01:23:28.844
Yes, of course I did.

01:23:28.919 --> 01:23:31.615
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

01:23:31.688 --> 01:23:33.883
I- I can't tell you
how relieved I am.

01:23:33.957 --> 01:23:36.221
I'm delighted
you came back this morning.

01:23:36.293 --> 01:23:38.784
I don't get it. You certainly haven't
been acting that way.

01:23:38.862 --> 01:23:43.162
Oh, I am sorry. I'm afraid I was confused.
But I'm not anymore.

01:23:43.233 --> 01:23:45.895
It's all very clear to me now.

01:23:45.969 --> 01:23:49.666
Jack, I wonder, would you
do me an enormous favor?

01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:53.369
- Sure, anything. - But we must act
quickly, before my husband gets here.

01:23:53.443 --> 01:23:55.434
- Okay.
- Now-

01:24:10.895 --> 01:24:13.056
Well, Monsieur Martin.

01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:15.565
Uh, good morning, Captain.

01:24:15.633 --> 01:24:20.434
Good morning.
I'm, uh-I'm delighted to find you here.

01:24:20.505 --> 01:24:22.530
- You are?
- Yes.

01:24:22.607 --> 01:24:25.337
I want to thank you
for what you did for me last night.

01:24:25.409 --> 01:24:29.038
I'm sending you a check in the morning
which will express my gratitude more fully.

01:24:29.113 --> 01:24:32.947
Well, thanks, Captain. I sure can use it.
By the way, what did I do?

01:24:33.017 --> 01:24:37.044
You made a great financial deal for me.
What did you say to Periton?

01:24:37.121 --> 01:24:40.181
Oh. I said, uh, "Hmm."

01:24:40.258 --> 01:24:42.886
- Oh, that.
- Yeah.

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.454
- I was told you always use it.
- But never with such success.

01:24:47.532 --> 01:24:51.093
Look, Captain. I don't know how to say
this. It's really none of my business.

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:53.296
But you're making a great mistake.

01:24:53.371 --> 01:24:57.137
- I am? How?
- Your wife. She's wonderful.

01:24:57.208 --> 01:25:01.611
Believe me, she's got everything,
everything a man could ask for.

01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:04.739
- I found that out.
- You know, she's so crazy about you...

01:25:04.816 --> 01:25:07.307
she just tried to talk me
into making you jealous.

01:25:07.385 --> 01:25:11.082
- You were supposed to come up
and find her in my arms. - Oh?

01:25:11.155 --> 01:25:15.057
Why don't you quit playing the field and
concentrate on her?

01:25:15.126 --> 01:25:18.152
- You're right, my friend.
- Now will you go up? She's waiting for you.

01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:21.130
Monsieur Martin...

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:24.100
will you and your charming Colette
have dinner with us tonight?

01:25:24.168 --> 01:25:27.968
We will come to the show and afterward,
the four of us will have a big celebration.

01:25:28.039 --> 01:25:31.907
- I wish we could, but, uh, I don't
know where Colette is. - No?

01:25:31.976 --> 01:25:35.606
No, she walked out on me.
She didn't understand about last night.

01:25:35.681 --> 01:25:40.084
- Oh, I am very sorry.
- So am I.

01:25:40.152 --> 01:25:43.679
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. No, I'm afraid not.

01:25:43.755 --> 01:25:47.657
- Wait a minute. You could do me one favor.
- Anything.

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:51.253
- Tell me, Captain. What's your secret?
- Secret?

01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:55.130
Yeah. Let's face it. We do resemble
each other. We proved that last night.

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.192
But when women
look at you, they-Well, you know.

01:25:58.270 --> 01:26:01.364
And when they look at me,
they run for the nearest exit.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.499
What's your secret?

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:13.884
- Well, thank you, Captain.
- Not at all.

01:26:13.952 --> 01:26:17.854
- Well, good-bye, Jack.
- Good-bye, Henri.

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:23.292
- Oh, Captain. Just one thing.
- Yes?

01:26:23.362 --> 01:26:26.957
Make sure she knows it's you this time.
I don't wanna get in any more trouble.

01:26:27.032 --> 01:26:29.694
Have no fear. She will know.
