00:14.200 --> 00:16.720
- David, what have you done?
- " Excuse me?

00:16.800 --> 00:21.320
I just got a call from the Secretary of State
about a covert action against the Chinese.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.480
That's correct. I sanctioned it.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.840
An attack on their consulate.
A military engagement.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.000
A covert operation.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.640
We marched on Chinese soil,

00:28.720 --> 00:32.800
we kidnapped one of their nationals, and
in the process the Chinese consul was killed.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.000
If we don't find that warhead
before it's deployed,

00:36.080 --> 00:38.800
ten million Americans
could face annihilation.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.560
We could be at war with a billion Chinese.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.760
- Is he gonna make it?
- We'll do our best.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.880
I just need him long enough
to get the information about Marwan.

00:46.960 --> 00:51.840
I know, Jack. You made me aware of that
when you forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.400
" I'm so sorry.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.640
You made a choice that killed Paul
and I'm trying to deal with it.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.680
We both have a job. Let's just do it.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.560
I know he worked on the warhead.
Now he needs to tell us where it is.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.360
He knows where Marwan might be.
A factory on Sixth.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.840
They're looking for the warhead in their cities.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.440
They have no idea that
it's going to be delivered by missile.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.480
Start the sequence.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.760
We're done here.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.720
They can't stop us now.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.880
I've been waiting for this.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.160
You're too late.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.400
Kill me.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.960
That won't stop the missile.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.040
- " Tony, can you see this?
- Yeah.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.800
Can you get the source of the transmission?

01:42.720 --> 01:45.800
No, it's on an encrypted uplink.
No way to trace it.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.240
Have you got a lock on the missile?

02:04.320 --> 02:06.720
Still trying to find it.
What about Marwan?

02:06.800 --> 02:10.560
I'm gonna scan the building, then
bring him into CTU. Prep a holding room.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.080
I'm going off com.
If you need me, get me on my cell.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.560
All right.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.920
Try and decode his files.
I'll prep a team to scan the building.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.320
Unbelievable.

02:21.400 --> 02:26.720
How did they manage to assemble a missile
capable of carrying a nuclear warhead?

02:26.800 --> 02:29.160
S-series cruise missile. Stealth technology.

02:29.240 --> 02:32.520
They smuggled it in piece by piece
and then assembled it on site.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.400
If it's Stealth, we can't track it by radar.
What about targets?

02:36.480 --> 02:38.560
Pull it up.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.760
An S-series has a range of 1800 miles.

02:41.840 --> 02:46.080
A warhead could be delivered from the
Midwest to anywhere in the continental US.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.440
Those missiles travel at a speed of 600mph.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.960
It could hit a target
on either coast in three hours.

02:51.040 --> 02:55.120
That's assuming it's headed for the coast.
If not, it could hit its target any time.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.040
No files. He just used this
to unscramble the downlink.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.680
- What else did you find?
- Nothing. Just the laptop and the cellphone.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.840
OK. Upload the SIM card to CTU.
See if any of it's traceable.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.200
- You got it.
- This is Bauer.

03:10.280 --> 03:15.000
This is Logan. I've been told a cruise missile
was launched containing a nuclear warhead.

03:15.080 --> 03:19.520
Our military tracking device is doing all
they can to find the trajectory of the missile,

03:19.600 --> 03:24.360
- but we don't have a lot to go on.
- What about Marwan? You think he'll break?

03:24.440 --> 03:29.080
That won't be easy, sir. He's planned and
organised everything that's happened today.

03:29.160 --> 03:33.640
- He's committed. He's prepared to die.
- I know you'll do your best. Keep me posted.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.120
Yes, sir. I will.

03:36.240 --> 03:41.080
Let the Joint Chiefs know. This should be
limited to the intelligence community only.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.880
A nuclear missile was launched.
We have to assume Washington is its target.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.080
- What are our options?
- " Not many.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.920
Our priority is to establish
a continuity of government

03:50.000 --> 03:53.280
and start a quiet evacuation
of government personnel in the city.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.160
Bring the cabinet members
and the Speaker to the bunker.

03:56.240 --> 04:01.960
Congress and Pentagon should be taken
to the mountain safety facility.

04:02.040 --> 04:07.400
Mike, let them know that this is a category
one emergency. Tell them nothing more.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.920
We can't afford an information leak.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.960
David, the public needs to be warned.
Cities need to be evacuated.

04:15.040 --> 04:19.000
Not yet. Let's see
what Bauer comes up with first.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.440
- He'll die before he talks to us.
- I know.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.000
Stand down.

04:34.960 --> 04:39.640
You and I both know all I wanna do right now
is kill you, but I have my orders.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.120
We've run out of time. You win.
I'm instructed to ask you what you want.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.360
What I want is already happening.

04:45.440 --> 04:50.080
The destruction of innocent life is a means
to an end. Why don't we just skip to the end?

04:50.160 --> 04:51.480
To the end?

04:51.560 --> 04:55.160
Everything you did today,
you did for a reason. For your people.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.240
What do you want to change?

04:57.320 --> 05:01.760
I have no interest in having
a political discussion with you.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.000
I am in the position to make things happen.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.720
I have the ear of the President
of the United States right now.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.960
You have the power to make
any kind of deal that you want,

05:11.040 --> 05:15.200
and I promise you, you'll do more for you
and your people if you cooperate with me

05:15.280 --> 05:18.480
than if you let that missile hit its target.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.600
You tell me where the missile's headed,
you help me stop it,

05:21.680 --> 05:25.240
and I guarantee you that you will talk
to the president and he will listen.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.200
He has no choice.

05:27.280 --> 05:31.960
Right here, right now,
you have the chance to get what you want.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.920
I already have, Agent Bauer.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.840
After this day, every elected official
and citizen of America

05:38.920 --> 05:45.040
will know that America cannot intervene
in our lives, in our countries, with impunity.

05:46.680 --> 05:51.080
Besides, your president sees me
in only one dimension.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.400
Evil.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.240
As you see us.

05:58.680 --> 06:02.360
Yes, and vulnerable.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.080
- Chloe.
- What?

06:09.160 --> 06:13.120
You'll never believe it. I got names
off the calls received on Marwan's cellphone.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.920
Take a look.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.280
- Richard Heller?
- Right. Secretary of Defense Heller's son.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.520
Called Marwan a week ago.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.800
Did you tell anyone yet?

06:25.560 --> 06:27.760
No. Just you.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.320
I'll let Buchanan know.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.600
With every minute
the missile's target zone widens.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.920
- We need to get updates from regional teams.
- Sorry to interrupt.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.600
Edgar pulled a name off Marwan's phone
from a call he received last week.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.400
- Who called him?
- Richard Heller.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.560
- Are you sure?
- The number originated from his cellphone.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.560
That's how Marwan knew
where Heller was yesterday morning.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.520
- Richard helped plan the kidnap?
- I don't know.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.880
- Where is he now?
- Well, it's 4am. He's at home asleep, I guess.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.880
- Where does he live?
- Van Nuys.

07:07.960 --> 07:14.080
- Do we have field teams in the area?
- I don't know. I'll pull it up on the IP phone.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.840
- Yes, we do.
- Dispatch them. I'll call Secretary Heller,

07:21.920 --> 07:24.280
tell him his son's being brought back in.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.680
Chloe, does Audrey know about this?

07:26.760 --> 07:31.800
No. It's more of a management conversation,
don't you think?

07:31.880 --> 07:36.440
Your team has been issued new orders.
You are to dispatch immediately to Van Nuys.

07:41.120 --> 07:44.480
- Audrey, you got a minute?
- Yeah, sure. What is it?

07:44.560 --> 07:47.480
- It's about your brother Richard.
- Is he all right?

07:47.560 --> 07:50.720
- I assume he is, yeah.
- What do you mean?

07:51.840 --> 07:55.400
We found out that Marwan got a call
from Richard's cellphone a week ago.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.560
I'm sorry, but that's absurd.

07:57.640 --> 08:01.120
We don't know what it means.
Buchanan sent a team to pick Richard up.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.000
He was brought in once today
and he was cleared.

08:04.080 --> 08:08.000
I know, but this call definitely
connects him to Marwan and the missile.

08:08.080 --> 08:14.160
Look, I don't know how he got mixed up
in this, but my brother is not a terrorist.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.360
Audrey.

08:18.320 --> 08:24.720
Richard's phone number was found on
the received registry of Marwan's SIM card.

08:24.800 --> 08:29.600
- Does my father know about this?
- Buchanan's calling him right now.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.040
All right.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.520
I'm sorry.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.360
All right. I'll tell him. Yeah.
Jack, we got something.

08:40.440 --> 08:44.120
- What?
- Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago.

08:44.520 --> 08:47.600
- We're sure?
- Yeah. They're bringing him to CTU.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.960
I wanna question this kid myself.
We need to get back there now.

08:53.560 --> 08:57.320
Put the suspect in the vehicle.
We're headed back to CTU now.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.440
It doesn't matter where you take me.

09:00.520 --> 09:02.920
Yeah. We'll see about that.

09:16.880 --> 09:20.120
- This is Bauer.
- Jack. Did you get anything out of Marwan?

09:20.200 --> 09:25.600
No. We've got a better chance of breaking him
at CTU. We're about ten minutes out.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.360
- Curtis, are you OK?
- Yes.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.160
- Can you see the shooters?
- On the roof behind us.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.920
Go!

09:57.920 --> 10:00.800
Notify the perimeter
we no longer have Marwan in custody.

10:00.880 --> 10:05.560
Perimeter teams, Marwan's escaped.
He's headed toward the southwest sector.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.880
- What have you got on Marwan?
- Nothing.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.600
He ditched the vehicle.
We can't find him on satellite.

10:28.680 --> 10:33.400
- How did his people get into that area?
- They didn't. They must've been there before.

10:33.480 --> 10:38.360
All right. Have perimeter teams comb
the nearby buildings for remaining hostiles.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.000
- We lost them, Jack.
- Dammit, Tony, how?

10:41.080 --> 10:45.040
They dumped their vehicle on the freeway.
Marwan got into another car.

10:45.120 --> 10:48.120
We're trying to analyse the satellite.
The images are noisy.

10:48.200 --> 10:53.160
- How does Buchanan wanna handle this?
- Finding Marwan is becoming less likely.

10:53.240 --> 10:56.840
We have to follow primary leads only.
Right now that's Richard Heller.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.520
- Has he arrived yet?
- No. He'll be back here momentarily.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.040
Bill, I wanna interrogate this kid myself.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.400
- I understand. I'll have him ready for you.
- We're on our way in.

11:06.480 --> 11:11.160
Curtis, we need to get back to CTU. They lost
Marwan. We'll have to track him from there.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.920
- What did Buchanan say?
- Heller's in first position.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.320
We're gonna interrogate him.

11:21.960 --> 11:23.960
Mr President.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.600
Please, everybody, be seated.

11:28.280 --> 11:31.800
I apologise for the abruptness
of your removal from your homes.

11:31.880 --> 11:37.880
Please know that every precaution had to be
taken to ensure the secrecy of your arrival.

11:39.160 --> 11:42.480
The US has been thrown
into a category one emergency.

11:42.560 --> 11:46.000
A cruise missile containing
a nuclear warhead has been launched

11:46.080 --> 11:51.640
and is now headed for, we believe, a major
US city, very possibly Washington, DC.

11:52.320 --> 11:55.520
Now, all branches of the military
have been alerted.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.440
They're doing everything in their power
to locate and intercept the missile.

11:59.520 --> 12:04.160
Excuse me, sir. You're saying that not only
do we not know what the missile's target is,

12:04.240 --> 12:07.320
- but you don't know where the missile is?
- That's correct.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.880
When do you plan to inform the public?

12:09.960 --> 12:15.400
At this time, we feel that informing the public
wouldn't be in the country's best interest.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.280
"We" meaning who, Mr President?

12:19.080 --> 12:21.200
I feel that way, Mr Speaker.

12:21.280 --> 12:25.280
Doesn't the public have
a right to know the truth?

12:25.360 --> 12:29.600
That's all I have for now.
When I know more, an update will be given.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.960
Thank you. Excuse me.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.760
Gentlemen.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.120
- Mr President.
- Yes, Don.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.760
Sir, I do not wish to question your decision
in front of the cabinet,

12:41.840 --> 12:46.520
but I think that you're making a grave mistake
in not alerting the public.

12:46.600 --> 12:52.320
Look, I've thought a lot about this,
and... I'm certain it's the right course.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.520
Well, if I may say so, sir,
you do not seem certain.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.800
It's a difficult day for all of us, Don.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.080
Now, if you'll excuse me...

13:11.160 --> 13:13.400
Mike.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.480
- What's going on here?
- Meaning what?

13:15.560 --> 13:18.640
Logan was just sworn in.
We're under a terrorist attack.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.640
He needs all the help he can get.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.360
He understands that and he's seeking advice.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.680
Not from his cabinet,
or the Congressional leadership.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.560
Give it time, Don.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.720
Give it time.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.120
Thank you.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.680
Tacticals are going
through Richard's things now.

13:45.760 --> 13:49.680
- What about Jack?
- Jack and Curtis are on their way back.

13:49.760 --> 13:53.760
Someone has to tell Audrey that Jack's
going to be interrogating her brother.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.480
Audrey's not gonna wanna
let Jack near her brother.

13:56.560 --> 14:01.360
It can't be helped. I mean, if Richard
knows something about that missile...

14:01.440 --> 14:04.560
This morning, Jack and Audrey
were planning their future.

14:04.640 --> 14:09.760
Now he's responsible for her husband's death
and he may have to torture her brother.

14:09.840 --> 14:14.840
And yet every move he's made
has been the right one.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.000
Not if he wanted to be with her.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.800
Look, Michelle.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.800
Everything that's happened here today...

14:30.560 --> 14:33.360
it's been hard going through it
with you again.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.680
It's been hard for me too.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.520
And I...

14:38.600 --> 14:42.480
Iook at what this job does
to the people in our positions,

14:42.560 --> 14:44.640
and I realise...

14:47.000 --> 14:49.200
I want us to be together again,

14:49.280 --> 14:52.160
but it's gotta be away from all this.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.800
You want us to leave our jobs?

15:01.120 --> 15:04.840
We've spent the last 12 years
of our lives doing this.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.720
Where would we go?

15:06.800 --> 15:08.600
What would we do?

15:08.680 --> 15:11.240
I don't care.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.680
People start over every day,
if it's important to them.

15:16.960 --> 15:21.400
You're asking me to leave
the only thing I've ever done.

15:22.760 --> 15:26.440
Yes, I am.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.480
" This is beyond belief!
I cannot be back here!

15:40.560 --> 15:44.240
Audrey, get me outta here! These guys
broke into my house. This is illegal.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.960
Richard, listen.
Just calm down, OK? Listen to me.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.680
Your number came up
on the cellphone of a terrorist.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.120
That's what they said and that's insane!

15:52.200 --> 15:54.080
- All right. Listen, OK?
- Audrey.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.120
Yes.

15:55.200 --> 15:59.200
- They have to get him into holding now.
- Audrey! Audrey, don't let them do this!

15:59.280 --> 16:01.280
Don't let them do this to me!

16:01.360 --> 16:04.000
- Who's interrogating him?
- Jack.

16:04.080 --> 16:06.400
What?

16:09.040 --> 16:12.120
- You are not gonna torture my brother.
- I'll be right in.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.920
We're outta time. He knows something
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.560
- And what if he doesn't?
- You're aware that he called Marwan.

16:19.640 --> 16:23.600
There has gotta be an explanation for that.
Let me talk to him.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.360
You believe you can interrogate
your own brother?

16:26.440 --> 16:32.520
Maybe I can get something out of him that
you can't. Please, just give me five minutes.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.200
Please.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.360
Take five minutes.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.440
Thank you.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.040
- Mike.
- Don.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.240
- How's President Logan managing?
- Given the circumstances, very well.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.560
I noticed that ex-president Palmer's here.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.920
Yes. He brought
the former president in to advise.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.320
Yeah, well, that's probably a good idea.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.960
Palmer's been at the helm in this kind
of crisis. He knows how to lead.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.840
President Logan doesn't
have any problem leading.

17:03.920 --> 17:08.680
No, not at all. It's just that if he's not going
to ask his cabinet for help, or the leadership,

17:08.760 --> 17:11.480
it comforts me somewhat

17:11.560 --> 17:13.760
that he's in good hands.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.880
- Is there something else you wanted to say?
- Yeah. Yeah, there is.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.760
The people elected John Keeler
to run this country.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.920
In his absence,
Logan is expected to take over,

17:25.000 --> 17:28.240
but if he's not up to the task, Mike,
it is I, Speaker of the House,

17:28.319 --> 17:31.400
and not David Palmer who steps up.

17:31.480 --> 17:35.840
Understood.
And let me assure you that's not the case.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.320
Logan is in complete control.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.920
- Excuse me, Don. I gotta get back.
- Sure.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.080
Excuse me, Mr President.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.160
We may have a problem.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.120
- What is it?
- Don Ashton.

17:58.200 --> 18:03.600
He's been asking questions and raising
concerns as to President Palmer's role here.

18:03.680 --> 18:07.360
That's too bad. We have more important
things to worry about at the moment.

18:07.440 --> 18:11.680
Sir, as Speaker of the House he can create
problems which you don't need right now.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.800
Mike's right, sir. Don's very ambitious.

18:14.880 --> 18:19.520
Now that he's next in line to the presidency,
he'll look to exploit any angle he can.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.000
He won't put ambition
before national security.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.120
He won't see it in those terms, sir.

18:24.200 --> 18:30.240
In his eyes, national security and his
personal ambition are one and the same.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.200
What do we do?

18:34.280 --> 18:37.120
Show him who's in charge.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.560
- Everything set up?
- Yeah, he's ready.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.680
Let's do this.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.280
- Hey.
- Audrey!

19:10.360 --> 19:12.680
Get me out! Tell them I didn't do anything!

19:12.760 --> 19:16.160
Richard, I want you to listen to me
very carefully, OK?

19:16.240 --> 19:21.200
A missile carrying a nuclear warhead
was launched by this man, Habib Marwan.

19:21.280 --> 19:25.400
- Tell me what you know about him.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

19:25.480 --> 19:29.800
CTU has proof that you called him last week.
Last Tuesday at four in the morning.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.920
I don't know any Habib Marwan
or anything about a missile.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.760
You have got to believe me.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.560
That missile is in the air now
heading toward a city.

19:37.640 --> 19:43.360
- Please, Richard, just tell me what you know.
- Look, I told you. I don't know anything.

19:43.440 --> 19:49.400
- Why'd you make that phone call last week?
- I didn't make a phone call, Audrey.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.120
What's happened with my son so far?

19:55.200 --> 19:58.320
We decided to let Audrey talk to him first.
They just started.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.840
- Has he confessed anything yet?
- No, sir.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.200
Richard, it's not making sense.
That call was made.

20:05.280 --> 20:10.520
Look, I don't know where you get
your information, Audrey, but it's all bull.

20:10.600 --> 20:15.240
His readings are spiking.
He's holding something back.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.720
Richard.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.480
Richard, I am begging you
to talk to me, all right?

20:21.560 --> 20:26.480
If you don't, there is a man who will come in
here and he will get the information from you.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.200
I saw him torture someone today.

20:29.280 --> 20:33.560
It's what he's trained to do. He won't stop
hurting you until you tell him the truth.

20:33.640 --> 20:34.960
Please.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.000
Don't let them do this to me.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.440
Tell me what you know and they won't.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.440
I don't know what you want from me. I don't.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.000
Richard, look at me. Look at me.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.760
We have a chance to fix this.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.480
- "Audrey..."
- " This is not working.

20:52.560 --> 20:56.000
We don't have time to coddle him. Open up.

20:56.480 --> 21:00.440
I don't care if he is my son.
He's playing games now.

21:03.360 --> 21:07.720
All right, Richard. This has gone far enough.
Either you tell us what we wanna know,

21:07.800 --> 21:11.880
or I will let them use every piece
of equipment they have to drag it out of you.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.120
You understand that?

21:14.200 --> 21:17.160
- Dad, don't.
- Audrey, leave the room.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.920
- Dad, please...
- Now!

21:21.000 --> 21:23.200
I mean it.

21:23.280 --> 21:28.040
- I want you to tell them everything you know.
- Don't let them do this to me.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.240
- " Now, what's it gonna be, Richard?"
- "Go to hell."

21:39.320 --> 21:41.640
I did nothing wrong. I don't have to tell you.

21:41.720 --> 21:46.000
There's a nuclear warhead gonna detonate
somewhere over this country.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.800
Those lost lives will be on your head.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.080
You will be a murderer!

21:51.160 --> 21:55.200
I didn't mean to do anything wrong, I swear.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.240
What did you do, Richard?
Tell me what you did.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.720
Look, don't...

22:05.800 --> 22:09.200
A week ago I was...

22:09.280 --> 22:12.760
I was at a bar and...

22:12.840 --> 22:16.360
and there was this girl and her boyfriend, OK?

22:17.520 --> 22:18.960
All right.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.720
- What were their names?
- I don't know.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.480
They wanted to party and I... we...

22:24.880 --> 22:27.200
we went back to my place.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.480
We got high and then...

22:34.080 --> 22:35.760
I guess...

22:35.840 --> 22:39.600
there was time for one of them
to make a call on my phone.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.600
How?

22:45.320 --> 22:47.960
When we were in bed.

22:50.040 --> 22:55.640
So, while you were in bed with her,
he used your phone in the other room?

22:56.920 --> 23:00.680
He wasn't the one in the other room, Dad.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.960
I was with him.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.280
She must have been the one
that made the call.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.920
So you were set up.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.320
Yeah, I guess so, Dad.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.600
Did they leave you with a number
or an address?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.480
No.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.120
What kind of a car were they driving?

23:41.200 --> 23:43.880
They didn't have one. I drove.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.240
Where did you drop them off afterwards?

23:47.320 --> 23:51.400
- I didn't. They took a cab.
- You remember the name of the company?

23:51.480 --> 23:53.760
No, Dad, I don't.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.880
Get logbooks from every cab company
that works in the area.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.920
- Get me a sketch artist now.
- I'll run it.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.360
- Take over.
- Yes, sir.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.880
So now you know.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.920
I suppose you're even more disgusted
with me, huh, Dad?

24:11.000 --> 24:15.360
This is not about how you choose
to live your life, son.

24:15.440 --> 24:18.920
This is about how you put
this country in jeopardy.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.920
If you had told us this yesterday, maybe
these attacks would not have occurred.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.720
No. Don't you put that on me, Dad,

24:25.800 --> 24:29.680
cos yesterday I didn't know that night
had anything to do with these attacks.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.520
You should've told us everything.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.440
I'll wait outside.

24:42.960 --> 24:46.640
You made a profound mistake today, Richard.

25:04.320 --> 25:07.960
Based on this information,
we can start to develop a contingency plan.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.560
- You got the cab company?
- Better than that. We got the cab driver.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.960
He dropped them off at an apartment complex
called the Mercerwood.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.960
- Did you talk to the manager?
- We gave him a description.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.480
- He knows what unit they're in.
- Jack, take this.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.680
I'm gonna need Curtis and Castle.

25:22.760 --> 25:26.600
- I need Curtis here with me.
- Then you gotta give me Tony.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.480
All right. What about
the phone call to Marwan?

25:31.560 --> 25:36.480
I analysed Richard's phone. The phone call
to Marwan activated a listen-in.

25:36.560 --> 25:39.400
He was able to hear all of Richard's calls
after that night.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.400
That's why Marwan knew
that Heller was visiting Richard.

25:42.480 --> 25:46.920
- Anything on the missile?
- We've run military protocol. So far, nothing.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.880
Is Logan gonna make an announcement?

25:48.960 --> 25:53.840
As of now, the president still thinks
that would do more harm than good.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.200
Please, as you were, everybody. Be seated.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.960
Gentlemen and ladies,
considering the crisis that we face today,

26:03.040 --> 26:06.360
I felt it prudent to enlist the assistance
of ex-president Palmer.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.240
- " In what capacity?
- Excuse me?

26:08.320 --> 26:11.440
Everybody in this room
has a title and specific function.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.720
Exactly what position
will President Palmer be occupying?

26:14.800 --> 26:16.800
I'm here solely as an advisor,

26:16.880 --> 26:19.960
not only to the president
but to anyone who requests my counsel.

26:20.040 --> 26:23.400
He is outside the chain of command,
if that's what you're asking.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.200
Asking for a clarification, sir.

26:26.280 --> 26:30.000
The missile carrying the warhead
was launched from a location in lowa.

26:30.080 --> 26:34.480
It's becoming more and more likely
that the target is on or near one of the coasts.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.760
It's clearly going to be New York or DC.
Why aren't we evacuating those two cities?

26:38.840 --> 26:41.160
I disagree, Jenny. It's not clear.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.720
And if you start to evacuate these two cities,

26:43.800 --> 26:48.440
then you may have an unauthorised
mass exodus of Boston, Philadelphia,

26:48.520 --> 26:50.440
Baltimore, Atlanta...

26:50.520 --> 26:53.120
The president shouldn't deal
with that situation.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.800
Maybe the president
should tell us that himself.

26:55.880 --> 27:00.840
Please, Mr Speaker. I've discussed this option
with a number of domestic experts,

27:00.920 --> 27:04.520
including President Palmer,
and that's my assessment as well.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.920
What about air defence?
Are we gonna stand by

27:07.000 --> 27:09.800
and let these cities' airspace
remain undefended?

27:09.880 --> 27:13.320
We have a limited number
of F-18 interceptorjets at our disposal.

27:13.400 --> 27:16.080
They need to be augmenting
the search for this missile

27:16.160 --> 27:18.240
and not deployed in a "wait and see" mode.

27:18.320 --> 27:22.040
Mr Palmer, I am sure that
we all appreciate your desire to help,

27:22.120 --> 27:25.880
but the Constitution has determined
who the decision makers should be.

27:25.960 --> 27:31.040
- I think you're overstepping your bounds.
- In the first place, it's "Mr President", Don.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.600
You should address
the content of my statements.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.160
David.

27:36.240 --> 27:40.040
You are to be addressed as "President",
it's an expression of respect,

27:40.120 --> 27:43.200
but not a functional title.

27:43.280 --> 27:47.320
I understand that, but you have to understand
I've been through this crisis before.

27:47.400 --> 27:52.800
Yes, but we are here now, the appointed
representatives of the people of the US.

27:52.880 --> 27:56.800
- Mr President...
- There will be no more discussion on this.

27:56.880 --> 27:59.160
Your point has been taken.

27:59.240 --> 28:03.200
However, Ashton has made a good point
and I wanna address his concerns.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.560
Perhaps it's best if I excuse myself.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.920
Perhaps.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.680
Ladies, gentlemen.

28:16.720 --> 28:22.640
Mr Speaker, I think you're right. We're gonna
put those jets over DC and New York.

28:35.880 --> 28:40.080
- Did you see it on the inside feed?
- Yes. It went exactly as you'd hoped.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.640
We won't have any more problems
with Don Ashton today.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.200
I hope you're right.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.960
We'll monitor everything on three.

28:49.040 --> 28:52.920
Make sure LAPD's there when we land.
We'll need transport to the site.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.720
- They've already been called.
- OK.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.160
Tony, wait.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.600
I-I can't...

29:05.840 --> 29:09.200
I can't spend another day without you.

29:09.280 --> 29:13.160
I'm ready to leave here.
I'm ready to go with you.

29:25.960 --> 29:26.960
Tony.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.440
Be careful.

29:40.120 --> 29:42.360
Right.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.960
They're setting up a feed.

29:44.040 --> 29:48.360
Richard will help Jack identify
the suspects when they get on site.

29:48.440 --> 29:51.960
- Then what?
- Then they'll let him go.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.480
His motives certainly weren't seditious.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.240
Dad, I feel so lost.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.000
I know, sweetheart.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.640
- " Ms Raines.
- Yes.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.000
Jack Bauer's on line two for you.

30:09.080 --> 30:11.520
Thank you.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.840
You take it, sweetheart. I'll be on the floor.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.800
- "Hello."
- Audrey, it's Jack.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.640
I know you don't wanna talk,
but I need to say a few things.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.160
All right.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.280
I know with everything that's happened,

30:44.360 --> 30:48.520
you've seen me do things that before now
you thought were unimaginable.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.600
I would have been happy to skip today.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.280
Yeah, me too.

30:54.440 --> 30:59.480
But I never believed you could ever love me
if you'd known about everything I've done.

30:59.560 --> 31:02.320
- Jack, I can't...
- "Audrey, please, let me finish."

31:03.160 --> 31:06.640
These were the things I was running
away from. That's why I moved to DC.

31:06.720 --> 31:09.720
That's why I stopped doing field work,
why I don't work at CTU.

31:09.800 --> 31:14.280
All I know is that you're back in it
and it's too much for me, Jack.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.200
I know.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.520
I know.

31:20.080 --> 31:23.640
The last thing I ever wanted to do
was push you away from me.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.800
God, Audrey, I love you.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.440
But this is how the job has to be done.

31:30.800 --> 31:36.840
I want you to know how sorry I am that it had
to involve you and the people you care about.

31:36.920 --> 31:40.280
Look, you don't have to say anything now.

31:40.360 --> 31:44.440
Please, just promise me
as soon as this is over,

31:44.520 --> 31:48.440
we can talk about everything that's happened.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.240
Audrey, please.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.120
Jack.

31:58.200 --> 32:01.760
I'm gotta call you back later, OK?

32:01.840 --> 32:03.640
All right.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.280
- Yeah.
- Tactical's got the schematic ready.

32:11.360 --> 32:16.600
- What are the approach perimeters?
- They want us to go in from the west.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.920
Edgar.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.080
This is the composite the artist made based
on Richard's description. Get it to Jack.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.240
Will do.

32:35.320 --> 32:39.920
- Now can we go?
- We have plenty of time to get to Marwan.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.240
I don't like cutting it this close.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.880
This is a sketch of the guy
Richard Heller described.

33:33.960 --> 33:36.840
He and the girl are our only leads
to finding Marwan,

33:36.920 --> 33:40.280
so once we identify the suspects
it is vital we take them alive.

33:40.360 --> 33:43.440
Manning.

33:43.520 --> 33:46.800
Curtis, it's Jack. We're getting ready to land.
Is everything set?

33:46.880 --> 33:49.040
Yeah. Richard's ready to make a positive ID.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.840
Copy that. I want you to stay on this channel.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.720
- You got it.
- We're a go.

34:14.920 --> 34:20.080
I need you to make sure no LAPD units go
inside our established perimeter. Am I clear?

34:20.159 --> 34:22.440
- Yes, sir.
- OK, let's go.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.440
- Ready?
- They found us.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.520
- What do you mean?
- A helicopterjust landed a block away.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.480
- So what?
- So, they found us.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.920
- Dammit!
- Hey! We can't go together.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.400
- Why not?
- One of us has to stay here in the apartment.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.480
- Why?
- If they think we're still here,

34:50.560 --> 34:52.600
it gives the other a chance to escape.

34:52.679 --> 34:56.320
You gotta be joking. One of us
is gonna get caught to save the other?

34:56.400 --> 34:58.600
Exactly. It's gonna be you.

35:29.880 --> 35:32.160
Do you wanna move in
on the apartment now?

35:32.240 --> 35:36.760
No. I want you and Castle to take up positions
here on the roof of the main building.

35:36.840 --> 35:39.080
- Teams B and C, are you in position?
- "Team A set."

35:39.160 --> 35:41.800
- " Team C in position."
- Copy that. Let's go.

35:43.480 --> 35:46.080
LAPD, I need the entry code
for the south gate.

35:46.160 --> 35:49.440
It's: Star 4763458.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.560
I'm in.

36:06.920 --> 36:11.240
OK, I've got a visual on the apartment.
There's activity inside.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.880
McAllen, meet me at the door of
the apartment. Have your people cover us.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.200
On my way. Go. Go.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.080
Pick it.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.560
OK.

37:14.920 --> 37:18.800
Put your hands where I can see them.
Put your hands where I can see them now!

37:23.240 --> 37:26.040
He's dead. Get a picture of him,
send it back to CTU.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.080
- Got it.
- Tony, this is Jack.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.720
- "Has anybody reported outside movement?"
- No. Why?

37:30.800 --> 37:33.720
The man is dead.
The girl is no longer in the apartment.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.680
- She couldn't get past the perimeter.
- "She could hide."

37:36.760 --> 37:40.680
All teams, maintain positions
until we search the other apartments.

37:40.760 --> 37:41.560
Roger that.

37:42.200 --> 37:46.680
- All teams, hold position.
- " Charlie, copy that. Holding steady."

37:58.280 --> 38:00.440
Drop your gun.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.240
Argh!

38:04.840 --> 38:06.800
All right. All right.

38:11.800 --> 38:14.080
Kick it away.

38:18.200 --> 38:22.040
Look, he's injured. Why don't you let him go?
You can take me instead.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.960
Your two-way.

38:29.120 --> 38:32.920
Turn around.
On your knees, hands on your head.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.640
Cuff him.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.720
Get up.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.760
" Curtis, you should have it.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.040
- Whoa.
- " Is that him? Is that him?

39:33.120 --> 39:34.400
Yeah. Yeah.

39:34.480 --> 39:38.160
Jack, that's him.
Richard gave us a positive ID on the picture.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.680
OK. Thank you, Curtis. Tactical, this is Bauer.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.760
I need five teams of two
to initiate a search of the complex.

39:43.840 --> 39:48.080
Start with the outer buildings along
the perimeter. Move your way in.

39:48.160 --> 39:51.040
Tony, this is Jack. We're initiating the search.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.760
Tony, do you copy?

39:53.840 --> 39:56.600
Castle, why is Almeida not on com?

40:02.120 --> 40:04.080
Tony, do you copy?

40:04.160 --> 40:06.240
Tony, come in!

40:34.200 --> 40:39.360
All teams, this is Bauer. Castle is down.
Almeida is missing and possibly a hostage.

40:39.440 --> 40:42.800
Our communications were compromised.
Move to secondary frequency.

40:42.880 --> 40:45.680
CTU, I need more tactical personnel now.

40:46.240 --> 40:49.120
Michelle, did you copy that? Michelle!

40:49.200 --> 40:53.280
You heard him, people. Shift profiles.
We may have a hostage situation.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.400
Move now!

41:15.960 --> 41:19.120
