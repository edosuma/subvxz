WEBVTT

00:03.879 --> 00:05.119
Whoo-hoo!

00:05.120 --> 00:07.079
Yeah!

00:07.080 --> 00:09.079
Whee!

00:09.080 --> 00:11.709
That's the spirit.
Like I always say,

00:11.710 --> 00:14.080
if you're gonna be late,
make an entrance.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.878
And here we are.

00:17.879 --> 00:19.459
Sorry I'm late, guys.
School night.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.249
Ms. Marvel, great
to have you here.

00:21.250 --> 00:25.619
Kamala! Welcome to the party!

00:25.620 --> 00:27.419
Nice to see you, Ms. Marvel.

00:27.420 --> 00:30.419
Hey, Shortstop,
glad you made it.

00:30.420 --> 00:33.618
Did I miss her? Is she here? Oh,
I really wanted to meet her.

00:33.619 --> 00:35.419
You have missed nothing, Ms.
Marvel.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.499
Indeed, now that
you have arrived,

00:37.500 --> 00:40.380
I can officially present the
reason for this gathering.

00:42.619 --> 00:45.020
My sister, Shuri,
princess of Wakanda.

00:47.420 --> 00:51.618
Shuri, these are my
compatriots, the Avengers.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.249
I'm very pleased
to meet you all.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.210
You said this was formal.

00:56.213 --> 00:58.459
It is your formal
introduction to the team.

00:58.460 --> 01:00.000
Just try to...

01:00.001 --> 01:01.538
Hi. So, I'm Kamala.

01:01.539 --> 01:04.378
Oh. Whoops. Sorry.
Superhero names, right?

01:04.379 --> 01:08.169
Ms. Marvel. My brother has
told me so much about you.

01:08.170 --> 01:11.749
Well, he told us next to
nothing about you. Shocking.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.749
I've never met a real princess.
It must be awesome.

01:14.750 --> 01:17.328
It... has its perks.

01:17.329 --> 01:20.499
You didn't have to go to all this
trouble for us to meet your sister,

01:20.500 --> 01:22.419
who is stunning, by the way.

01:22.420 --> 01:25.038
We could've just ordered some
pizza, watched a movie on the TV.

01:25.039 --> 01:27.328
Shuri is the crown
princess of Wakanda.

01:27.329 --> 01:29.078
She does not order in.

01:29.079 --> 01:31.119
Maybe she should.
Maybe you should.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.169
You gotta start relaxing, buddy.

01:33.170 --> 01:36.878
We are colleagues. Allies.

01:36.879 --> 01:39.288
I don't think we are... buddies.

01:39.289 --> 01:42.709
You're an Avenger. I'm an Avenger.
We're practically family.

01:42.710 --> 01:45.499
If that is so, we'd know
things about one another

01:45.500 --> 01:47.828
that the general public
would not, correct?

01:47.829 --> 01:49.288
Well, yeah, in theory.

01:49.289 --> 01:53.419
Then tell me, buddy, what
is my favorite color?

01:53.420 --> 01:56.288
I'm gonna go with... black?

01:56.289 --> 01:58.120
Huh?

01:59.460 --> 02:01.958
<i>Breaking news. Hundreds
of unknown soldiers</i>

02:01.959 --> 02:03.828
<i>are attacking Manhattan.</i>

02:03.829 --> 02:06.208
<i>First responders have been
activated all over the city.</i>

02:06.209 --> 02:07.645
<i>Stay tuned for updates.</i>

02:07.646 --> 02:09.079
Shuri, go to the embassy.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.310
But, T'Challa, I can...

02:10.311 --> 02:11.538
Please do not argue.

02:11.539 --> 02:12.830
Go!

02:14.039 --> 02:15.538
Black Panther!

02:15.539 --> 02:18.209
T'Challa! How does
he expect to get...

02:18.210 --> 02:20.329
Never mind. Let's go.

02:26.289 --> 02:28.878
Okay, people. You
know the drill.

02:28.879 --> 02:31.039
Protect civilians,
stop bad guys.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.210
Aah!

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:52.210 --> 02:54.209
Anybody got an ID on these guys?

02:54.210 --> 02:56.039
Atlanteans, forward!

02:59.879 --> 03:01.878
People of the surface,

03:01.879 --> 03:05.878
I am Tiger Shark of Atlantis,

03:05.879 --> 03:09.789
and this city belongs to me!

Sync and corrections by
<font color="#ff0000">masaca</font> - addic7ed.com -

03:51.510 --> 03:55.678
Atlantis already rules three
quarters of this world.

03:55.679 --> 03:59.009
The oceans must rule it all!

03:59.010 --> 04:03.088
You will fall before
me, surface dwellers!

04:03.089 --> 04:05.589
All of you will...

04:07.510 --> 04:10.588
What are you doing
here, Tiger Shark?

04:10.589 --> 04:12.380
What is this madness?

04:13.380 --> 04:14.968
Black Panther.

04:14.969 --> 04:17.918
I hadn't thought
to find you here.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.378
No matter.

04:19.379 --> 04:21.970
You will die just like the rest!

04:24.420 --> 04:27.378
Attuma signed a treaty
with the surface world.

04:27.379 --> 04:29.549
Why is Atlantis attacking now?

04:29.550 --> 04:32.049
Attuma is a fool.

04:32.050 --> 04:34.049
I will conquer this city.

04:34.050 --> 04:37.469
I will rule the surface,
and Atlantis as well!

04:37.470 --> 04:38.470
Ah-ah-ah!

04:42.550 --> 04:45.008
Oh. Wow. I felt that.

04:45.009 --> 04:47.339
Tiger Shark? He's
more like Tiger Tank.

04:47.340 --> 04:50.258
Tiger Shark is one of
Attuma's generals.

04:50.259 --> 04:51.758
He is a formidable opponent.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.969
Formidable? He went
down with one punch.

04:54.970 --> 04:56.549
You're welcome for
the save, buddy.

04:56.550 --> 04:58.339
Save? I was attempting

04:58.340 --> 05:00.419
to learn the reason for
this attack when...

05:02.886 --> 05:03.969
Nope.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.590
Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope, nope.

05:05.593 --> 05:06.839
Bad sharky!

05:08.550 --> 05:11.508
Wow. That was easier
than I expected.

05:11.509 --> 05:12.694
It is not over.

05:12.695 --> 05:13.878
I think it's over.

05:13.879 --> 05:15.758
And BT-dubs, you're
welcome, again.

05:15.759 --> 05:18.549
There was no splash. Why
wasn't there a sp...

05:18.550 --> 05:20.420
Iron Man, look out!

05:36.259 --> 05:38.549
Keep him off me.

05:38.550 --> 05:40.378
I need to do some quick repairs.

05:44.926 --> 05:46.258
That was my intention.

05:46.259 --> 05:48.919
Okay. I'm taking back
the "one punch" thing.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.589
This guy's like the Hulk
down here, with fins.

05:51.590 --> 05:54.508
Tiger Shark is vastly
more powerful underwater.

06:02.470 --> 06:05.219
You're only the first to fall.

06:05.220 --> 06:07.008
All of the surface world

06:07.009 --> 06:09.840
will kneel before Tiger Shark!

06:12.879 --> 06:16.300
So, you think now's a good time
to tell me your favorite color?

06:24.090 --> 06:26.469
Keep the pressure on.
We're pushing them back.

06:26.470 --> 06:31.008
I do prefer throwing, Captain,
but, yes, we are winning the day!

06:31.009 --> 06:32.970
Er, night!

06:44.779 --> 06:46.819
The Asgardian is right, my lord.

06:46.820 --> 06:50.778
The Avengers are winning. Is it
not now time to use the weapon?

06:50.779 --> 06:56.158
We will deploy the weapon
when <i> I</i> decide,<i> if</i> I decide.

06:56.159 --> 06:58.239
Keep to the plan!

06:58.240 --> 07:00.949
So, reroute from
tier six and three.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.529
No? All right.

07:02.532 --> 07:05.658
Uh, connect auxiliaries at
junction Beta 4-5, and...

07:05.659 --> 07:07.620
No again. Uh...

07:07.623 --> 07:10.158
T'Challa, tell me
you've got something.

07:10.159 --> 07:11.950
- I do.
- Hey, stop that!

07:11.953 --> 07:14.578
I'm having enough trouble
with Tiger Shark damage.

07:14.579 --> 07:18.778
The net is an Atlantean version of the
Starktech plasma cable, is it not?

07:18.779 --> 07:21.619
Basically. The phase variance
is a bit off, but...

07:21.620 --> 07:23.989
Wait a minute. How do you
know about the plasma cable?

07:23.990 --> 07:25.819
We're not releasing that
until the next Stark Expo.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.278
That is not important now.
I have the solution.

07:29.279 --> 07:31.619
I believe if we combine systems,

07:31.620 --> 07:33.619
we can create a
counter-variance pulse and...

07:33.620 --> 07:35.989
<i>And disrupt the net.
Good thinking, buddy.</i>

07:35.990 --> 07:38.028
Please do not call me "buddy."

07:38.029 --> 07:41.739
Rerouting tier four to upper plating.
Repulsor packs charging.

07:41.740 --> 07:44.408
Connecting junctions
15, 6, and 78.

07:44.409 --> 07:47.158
Ready for counter-pulse
in five, four...

07:47.159 --> 07:48.619
Three, two...

07:48.620 --> 07:50.240
One!

07:54.909 --> 07:57.408
Hey, guys, how was the swim?

07:59.740 --> 08:02.739
Welcome back. We can
use the extra hands.

08:05.079 --> 08:07.778
It seems you've contained
the battle to the bridge.

08:09.409 --> 08:11.820
Mostly.

08:18.159 --> 08:20.369
If we win here, the
fight is over.

08:20.370 --> 08:23.779
It is not over until
Tiger Shark is defeated.

08:28.240 --> 08:32.028
Call a halt, villain.
Your war ends here.

08:32.029 --> 08:34.948
No, Asgardian.

08:34.950 --> 08:37.779
Here is where the war begins!

08:37.780 --> 08:41.409
Mm, no. I'm pretty
sure this is the part

08:41.409 --> 08:44.578
where the bad guy gets smacked
unconscious, and the Avengers win.

08:44.579 --> 08:47.319
My lord, the weapon!
Now is the time!

08:47.320 --> 08:50.869
You are right. Now is the time.

08:54.119 --> 08:55.739
The Horn of Neptune!

08:58.780 --> 09:00.488
Everyone, back!

09:05.410 --> 09:07.115
Well, that was awful.

09:10.450 --> 09:13.738
You have no idea what's coming.

09:13.739 --> 09:15.949
None of you!

09:20.710 --> 09:22.878
Aah! What was that thing?

09:22.879 --> 09:25.788
Honestly, I was kind
of expecting more.

09:25.789 --> 09:28.288
I mean, don't get me wrong.
It was bad, but...

09:28.289 --> 09:32.878
The Horn of Neptune is not
the danger, Ms. Marvel.

09:32.879 --> 09:35.168
The danger is in what it calls.

09:35.169 --> 09:37.080
What does it call?

09:43.120 --> 09:44.580
That.

09:54.620 --> 09:57.209
Down, beast!

09:57.210 --> 10:00.038
Yield! Yield!

10:03.919 --> 10:06.168
I don't think it's listening.

10:06.169 --> 10:07.709
Then we turn up the volume.

10:12.081 --> 10:13.878
This isn't working!

10:13.879 --> 10:15.499
T'Challa, duck!

10:15.500 --> 10:18.709
Tiger Shark must not be allowed

10:18.710 --> 10:20.918
to use the Horn of
Neptune a second time.

10:20.919 --> 10:22.829
Split the team.
It's the only way.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.499
Heavy hitters, hold the bridge.
That means you, too, Ms. Marvel.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.918
Wait. I'm a heavy hitter?

10:27.919 --> 10:29.000
Awesome!

10:32.210 --> 10:36.289
Come on, boys! We're
going shark hunting!

10:37.879 --> 10:40.878
Iron Man, Black Panther,
we're moving out.

10:40.879 --> 10:42.999
You really like giving
orders, don't you?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.039
Old habits.

10:46.330 --> 10:49.288
Come on, buddy. I'm your ride.

10:49.289 --> 10:52.119
I'm getting traces of the
horn's unique energy signature,

10:52.120 --> 10:53.668
but nothing conclusive.

10:53.669 --> 10:56.249
What's the skinny on this
Horn of Neptune thing?

10:56.250 --> 10:57.788
What are we actually
dealing with?

10:57.789 --> 11:00.249
It is a powerful
Atlantean artifact.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.418
Wakanda keeps track
of such items.

11:02.619 --> 11:04.618
This is one of the worst.

11:04.619 --> 11:06.279
All right. Well, he's used it,

11:06.280 --> 11:08.279
and we have our
giant sea monster.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.450
What more can he do?

11:09.451 --> 11:10.618
There are many such creatures

11:10.619 --> 11:12.279
in the oceans' depths.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.659
The horn can summon all of
them if Tiger Shark wishes.

11:14.660 --> 11:17.319
See? This is the kind of thing
you share with your buddies

11:17.320 --> 11:20.449
before the super-powered megalomaniac
tries to take over the world.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.949
What's important is
finding Tiger Shark ASAP,

11:22.950 --> 11:24.615
before he can use
the horn again.

11:24.616 --> 11:26.279
Why is he running away?

11:26.280 --> 11:28.779
He's got that horn. Why not
stay with his soldiers?

11:28.780 --> 11:31.319
He is most powerful in water.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.029
It does not make sense he'd
move away from the river.

11:34.030 --> 11:35.279
Unless...

11:35.280 --> 11:37.530
Unless...

11:41.450 --> 11:44.118
Unless what? Finish
your sentences!

12:11.830 --> 12:14.749
Away, vile creature!

12:14.750 --> 12:17.829
You shall not have this bridge!

12:17.830 --> 12:20.619
Guys, whatever you're
doing, do it faster!

12:20.620 --> 12:22.710
I don't know how long
we can hold this thing!

12:28.539 --> 12:30.788
The horn's energy signature
is stronger here.

12:30.789 --> 12:33.788
Tiger Shark definitely
came this way.

12:33.789 --> 12:35.999
<i>Can you track him?</i>

12:36.000 --> 12:37.918
I can.

12:37.919 --> 12:39.315
Can you track me?

12:39.316 --> 12:40.709
<i>Absolutely, buddy.</i>

12:40.710 --> 12:43.749
<i>With your stealth mesh turned off,
you're lit up like a Christmas Tree.</i>

12:43.750 --> 12:45.619
Fine.

12:45.620 --> 12:47.960
Follow and be ready.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.038
All is well, my lord.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.749
Your army will take
this city, after all.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.918
With the power of this weapon...

12:57.919 --> 13:01.579
The horn is nothing.
This city is nothing.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.999
Find the others. Meet me
at the rendezvous point.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.620
Go!

13:11.789 --> 13:13.788
<i>Tiger Shark, what
are you playing at?</i>

13:13.789 --> 13:15.579
<i>Have you secured the target?</i>

13:15.580 --> 13:17.829
How dare you speak to me thus!

13:17.830 --> 13:19.829
<i>I dare quite a lot, Atlantean,</i>

13:19.830 --> 13:22.378
<i>and you are running out of time.</i>

13:22.379 --> 13:24.829
<i>This battle with the
Avengers is taking too long!</i>

13:24.830 --> 13:27.418
Watch your tone, human.

13:27.419 --> 13:29.918
All goes according to my plan.

13:29.919 --> 13:34.418
"The best laid plans of mice
and men often go awry."

13:34.419 --> 13:35.619
Robert Burns.

13:35.620 --> 13:38.709
Well, the king of cats.

13:38.710 --> 13:41.918
So brave, so foolhardy.

13:41.919 --> 13:45.829
Not so foolhardy. Cats
do eat fish, after all.

13:45.830 --> 13:48.918
And sharks eat everything!

14:03.250 --> 14:05.288
Aah!

14:14.500 --> 14:15.250
Fool.

14:15.251 --> 14:18.379
Water is my element.

14:21.169 --> 14:24.038
Did you think you could
face me here alone?

14:24.039 --> 14:26.210
Who told you that I was alone?

14:30.580 --> 14:32.169
Aah!

14:34.580 --> 14:37.119
Have you learned nothing?

14:37.120 --> 14:40.038
I have the Horn of Neptune!

14:40.039 --> 14:41.999
Sorry.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.918
We already heard that song.

14:54.463 --> 14:55.959
No dice, fella.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.038
We really can't let
you have that.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.459
It is over, Tiger Shark.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.538
Surrender.

15:14.539 --> 15:17.418
You think you've won?

15:17.419 --> 15:20.789
You've won nothing!

15:26.319 --> 15:28.779
Tiger Shark's gone again.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.900
He destroyed the horn.

15:31.901 --> 15:33.278
That's a good thing, right?

15:33.279 --> 15:34.639
Please tell me
that's a good thing.

15:36.439 --> 15:37.939
Thor, what's your status?

15:42.279 --> 15:45.609
Victory is ours, Captain.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.520
Uh, guys?

15:48.769 --> 15:50.809
The beast's power
was tremendous,

15:50.810 --> 15:52.349
but we have taken the field!

15:53.371 --> 15:54.388
Guys?

15:54.389 --> 15:58.100
Easy, Muscles. We did good out
here, but let's not get cocky.

16:02.269 --> 16:04.680
Guys, look!

16:15.850 --> 16:18.268
All right, then.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.429
Hey, Army, you know
what would be great?

16:20.430 --> 16:23.018
If you guys could do whatever it is
you're going to do with that horn.

16:23.019 --> 16:26.680
Please? Now? Like, right now?

16:29.389 --> 16:31.268
The big brains are
working on it.

16:31.269 --> 16:33.349
You'll just have to
hold the line, soldier.

16:33.350 --> 16:34.679
<i>Easy for you to say.</i>

16:34.680 --> 16:36.888
No circuitry, no working parts.

16:36.889 --> 16:38.475
How can it be just a shell?

16:38.476 --> 16:40.059
Two possibilities.

16:40.060 --> 16:42.559
A unique lattice of
fissures in its structure

16:42.560 --> 16:45.219
allowed it to produce its effects
when air was forced through.

16:45.220 --> 16:46.220
Or...

16:46.221 --> 16:47.768
"Or"? What's "or"?

16:47.769 --> 16:50.219
Or it is magic.

16:50.220 --> 16:51.768
Okay, let's reconstruct.

16:51.769 --> 16:54.388
These monsters are just...
monsters, right?

16:54.389 --> 16:55.660
They're not trained to obey.

16:55.661 --> 16:56.929
They are mindless.

16:56.930 --> 16:59.179
The horn calls them,
and they follow,

16:59.180 --> 17:01.219
attacking everything
in their path.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.309
So this thing has to have
an off switch, right?

17:04.310 --> 17:06.309
Yes. A counter-charm.

17:06.310 --> 17:08.637
But it requires the horn
to be in one piece.

17:08.638 --> 17:11.138
We'll leave you to it.
Come on, Cap.

17:19.929 --> 17:22.719
High and low, just
like in training.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.349
If I have to smell

17:33.350 --> 17:35.059
this thing much longer,
I'm gonna barf!

17:35.060 --> 17:36.060
Ugh!

17:40.560 --> 17:42.639
Captain Marvel!

17:55.679 --> 18:00.389
632, 633, 634, 635!

18:00.429 --> 18:02.265
Yes! We've got our off switch.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.319
The mapping is good. It
is a perfect replica.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.399
See? That wasn't so hard.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.569
Couple more compliments, and we'll
graduate from buddies to bromance.

18:10.570 --> 18:14.399
Right. Well, this hologram cannot
stand in for the horn itself.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.188
It lacks sufficient energy.

18:16.189 --> 18:17.630
Pretty sure my armor...

18:17.631 --> 18:19.069
Cannot generate enough energy.

18:19.070 --> 18:21.688
We need something at least
four times as powerful.

18:21.689 --> 18:23.688
Something...

18:23.689 --> 18:26.109
like that.

18:26.110 --> 18:29.188
Well, two for the penthouse?

18:29.189 --> 18:33.439
Indeed. I believe your arc
reactor might be just enough.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.400
Your arc reactor is not enough!

18:37.403 --> 18:39.728
I know. We have to
go with plan B.

18:39.729 --> 18:43.279
Right. Tap the
city's energy grid.

18:50.780 --> 18:52.860
Sorry, New York.
It's only temporary.

18:52.861 --> 18:54.938
Almost!

18:54.939 --> 18:56.188
Almost there!

18:56.189 --> 18:57.978
"Almost" won't cut it!

18:57.979 --> 18:59.688
I need more!

18:59.689 --> 19:02.569
There is no more!
The city is dark!

19:02.570 --> 19:04.438
Somebody's still got
their lights on!

19:04.439 --> 19:07.019
Who is that?

19:10.280 --> 19:12.438
The Wakandan Embassy! Of course!

19:12.439 --> 19:14.279
Makes sense.

19:14.280 --> 19:17.359
You're using one of those Vibranium
Gyroforges as a generator.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.840
Am I right?

19:18.841 --> 19:20.319
The Gyroforge is a secret.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.445
How do you know of it?

19:21.446 --> 19:22.569
We're buddies.

19:22.570 --> 19:25.859
We know things about each
other most people don't.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.820
Fair enough.

19:46.900 --> 19:50.149
Guys, seriously,
what's the holdup?

19:50.150 --> 19:53.228
<i>You see? If you had let me</i>

19:53.229 --> 19:55.728
<i>stay and help you, all of
this could've been avoided.</i>

19:55.729 --> 19:58.569
How would your presence
have changed...

19:58.570 --> 20:02.188
Never mind. Shuri,
please just do as I say.

20:02.189 --> 20:05.399
Connect the embassy's Vibranium
Gyroforge to the city's power grid.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.978
Sisters, huh?

20:06.979 --> 20:08.065
You have no idea.

20:11.479 --> 20:14.688
Shuri did it! We're
at 150 percent.

20:14.689 --> 20:17.609
Yes, yes. Wakandan
technology is fantastic.

20:17.610 --> 20:19.729
Blow the horn!

20:51.570 --> 20:53.569
Yeah! And stay out!

20:53.570 --> 20:56.359
Avengers, the bridge is clear.

20:59.939 --> 21:02.904
Nice work, team, but
we've got some bad news.

21:02.905 --> 21:05.359
We got ambushed by some
Atlantean stragglers.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.242
We lost Tiger Shark's
trail near Embassy Row.

21:08.493 --> 21:09.619
Embassy Row?

21:09.620 --> 21:11.359
What's Tiger Shark want there?

21:11.360 --> 21:12.779
Oh, no!

21:13.180 --> 21:16.799
Reconnect to Shuri,
royal priority!

21:16.800 --> 21:20.338
<i>And another thing. Aren't you
the one who strictly forbids us</i>

21:20.339 --> 21:22.759
<i>from connecting the embassy
to outside systems?</i>

21:22.760 --> 21:26.720
<i>- Honestly, for a king...</i>
- Shuri, behind you!

21:26.919 --> 21:28.589
Shuri!
