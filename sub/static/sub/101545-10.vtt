WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:02.002
Mistress:
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:02.002 --> 00:04.504
So wonderful
to finally meet you.

00:04.546 --> 00:07.007
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- I don't love her.

00:07.048 --> 00:09.009
No, go back to your wife,
Lord Tobin.

00:09.050 --> 00:11.094
This is not how I imagined
my life to turn out!

00:11.136 --> 00:13.638
You still have enough men
to make a mark.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.682
I think I know how
to find Yavalla.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.684
These people,
they're being drawn somewhere.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.519
Into the mountains
like they're on a pilgrimage?

00:19.561 --> 00:22.188
No ignition necessary.
Just throw it at Yavalla.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.440
Oh, and chop off her head
whilst you're at it.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.191
Hopefully one of these
will work

00:25.233 --> 00:27.027
before Zed and his gang figure
out how to kill my mother.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.903
An antidote.
We have to go save my mother!

00:28.945 --> 00:30.655
That's the ancient
Blackblood temple.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.575
All: Hail, Wren,
daughter of Yavalla.

00:33.616 --> 00:34.993
Uh...

00:40.623 --> 00:43.251
Your mum's got a lot more
friends than she used to.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.545
They aren't friends, Munt.
They're under her control.

00:51.259 --> 00:53.261
She's in there.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.889
Well, this looks safe,
doesn't it?

00:55.930 --> 00:59.517
No. But it can't be
any more dangerous than
it already is out here.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.931
Janzo, that old man,
that looks like--

01:37.972 --> 01:40.683
Captain Orlick.
He was one of the first.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.769
Doesn't have much longer,
I imagine.

01:56.574 --> 01:59.536
Wren.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.830
Step inside.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.582
The High Priestess
will see you.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.835
Alone.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.419
Janzo and Munt can wait here.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.341
They won't be touched.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.930
Wren, we're in this together.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.558
It's the best hope
we have at saving her.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.602
- You take the second one.
- Remember, you don't have to
inject it all to kill a kinj.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.710
( hawk screeching )

02:53.548 --> 02:56.718
- Daughter.
- Mother.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.304
You have come at last.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.392
I have so longed for you
to be one with us.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.311
You, above all others,

03:06.352 --> 03:08.813
you truly deserve the peace,

03:08.855 --> 03:12.984
the strength of Unity
that only we know.

03:13.026 --> 03:17.155
I don't know how much of this
is you and how much of it
is the kinj, but I--

03:17.197 --> 03:21.492
( chuckles ) It is all me,
I can assure you.

03:21.534 --> 03:25.413
I have become
what I was destined to be.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.208
The Bringer of Peace,
as you can see.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.001
- At what cost?
- Cost?

03:30.043 --> 03:32.212
The innocent people
you control.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.172
They've lost all ability
to choose for themselves.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.841
Their choice is to be United,

03:36.883 --> 03:38.843
to be devoid of all conflict.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.095
To lose themselves
to paradise,

03:41.137 --> 03:43.973
and thereby find themselves
more whole than ever before.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.392
No one chooses this paradise

03:46.434 --> 03:47.977
unless they have a kinj
forced upon them.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.438
No one? I certainly did.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.482
No, you didn't know the kinj
would do this before
you took it on.

03:52.523 --> 03:55.693
I knew as surely as one can
before experiencing.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.821
Wren, I chose this
for the good of all.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.032
Well, they're all dying.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.660
Every living thing dies.

04:03.701 --> 04:07.455
But in Unity,
each one dies on paradise.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.666
And I am made
the stronger for it,

04:09.707 --> 04:11.459
more able to carry on
my mission.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.879
- A mission of death?
- Of life eternal.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.049
If-- if I unite with you,
I'll die in only weeks.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.884
You're willing to let
that happen?

04:19.926 --> 04:23.680
You will be with me forever,

04:23.721 --> 04:26.307
living on in me eternally,

04:26.349 --> 04:28.101
having become one with a god.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.895
- What?
- ( chuckles )

04:30.937 --> 04:32.981
Is it not obvious,
my daughter?

04:33.022 --> 04:36.317
I am a god.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.656
( theme music playing )

04:51.582 --> 04:53.543
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

05:01.676 --> 05:05.722
What's going on in that head
of yours, Tobin?

05:05.763 --> 05:08.558
- You don't want to know.
- I'll be the judge of that.

05:10.893 --> 05:14.314
You're thinking of her.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.149
I can say, having
finally met Rosmund,

05:16.190 --> 05:17.900
I can certainly see
the attraction.

05:17.942 --> 05:22.947
She's beautiful,
charming, well-spoken.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.159
So, tell me,
which of her qualities is it

05:26.200 --> 05:27.785
that you find most appealing?

05:27.827 --> 05:29.537
Please, Falista,
let's not do this.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.498
Well, it seems
the choice is between talk
of your former lover

05:32.540 --> 05:37.545
or no talk at all,
and I've grown weary of
the silence, Tobin.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.796
Sorry. Do you want to talk
about the weather?

05:38.838 --> 05:40.840
Certainly.

05:40.882 --> 05:44.385
It's been nothing
but unseasonable gloom
since we left Aegisford.

05:44.427 --> 05:47.347
How long should I
expect it to last?

05:47.388 --> 05:49.557
Oh, there's a break
in the clouds.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.101
Haven't seen that smile
in some time.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.937
You think we may see
some sunshine after all?

05:54.979 --> 05:58.900
Well, there's nothing so
changeable as the weather, eh?

05:58.941 --> 06:02.403
- She made me feel useful.
- What?

06:02.445 --> 06:05.698
You asked what I liked
about being with Rosmund.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.992
Being with her
gave me purpose.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.370
Made me feel like
I was making my mark on
the world, you know?

06:10.411 --> 06:12.789
As you still are.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.207
Now more than ever.

06:26.677 --> 06:27.762
There.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.016
Yavalla's following
is a lot bigger.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.937
- It continues to grow.
- Where is she?

06:35.978 --> 06:40.441
Probably in that temple there
where they're all facing.

06:40.483 --> 06:44.821
- Gods, it's Janzo and Munt.
- What are they doing here?

06:44.862 --> 06:47.573
- Are they turned?
- I don't think so.
They look too uncomfortable.

06:47.615 --> 06:51.035
- I'm going to help--
- Wait.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.621
They're clearly waiting
for someone inside that temple.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.791
- So?
- We don't want to ruin a plan
that might be working.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.709
And what about this scenario
makes you think it can end well?

06:58.751 --> 07:01.963
Janzo's there.
How many times have you told me

07:02.004 --> 07:04.090
he's the smartest
human you know?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.383
As uncomfortable as he looks,

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
he's making
no attempts to escape.

07:07.468 --> 07:08.678
Must have something
up his sleeve.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.556
Let's just give it a moment.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.652
I don't like this, Janzo.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.446
Why are they all
looking at us like that?

07:26.487 --> 07:29.657
'Cause we're outsiders, Munt.
We're not part of the hive.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.243
But statistically speaking,
a fair number of them

07:32.285 --> 07:35.079
must have already had
their kinjes split since
we've arrived.

07:35.121 --> 07:38.458
No doubt they're
trying to pass on their
extra one to us.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.043
Yavalla mustn't be
allowing them then.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.088
Huh.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.300
Do you suppose it's like,
you know, holding it in
when you gotta go?

07:47.341 --> 07:50.678
I don't know, Munt.
Yes, I suppose so.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.930
Ooh.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.349
Sorry, Captain.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.310
- I hate that feeling.
- Munt.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.979
- I do.
- There is no hate

08:00.021 --> 08:02.023
in the paradise we share.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.906
What's taking Wren so long,
Janzo?

08:09.947 --> 08:11.199
She's just gotta stick her mum
with that needle, right?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.701
We have to wait
for the right moment.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.578
We might not get
to try this twice.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.788
Oh.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.373
( screeching )

08:19.415 --> 08:21.918
Wren, do you not see?
There is nothing to fear,

08:21.959 --> 08:25.838
nothing to lose,
only eternity to gain.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.716
- I want to believe you, Mother.
- You can believe me.

08:28.758 --> 08:32.094
How could I want anything
but what's best for you?

08:33.262 --> 08:35.097
Come to me.

08:35.139 --> 08:39.310
Please. We will be closer
than we have ever been.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.104
You will see.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.322
Oh.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.532
Oh.

09:01.207 --> 09:04.210
( ghostly whispering )

09:16.055 --> 09:17.765
Janzo!

09:17.807 --> 09:20.726
- No!
- Janzo!

09:22.603 --> 09:25.147
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving you.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.150
I did it.
I injected her.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.377
Uh-oh.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.756
Oh, foolish child.
You really think an alchemist
remedy is a match for me?

09:50.798 --> 09:54.051
It only works on
her offspring kinj.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.345
- Wren, have you
understood nothing?
- I understand enough.

09:56.387 --> 10:00.516
Whatever peace or paradise
this is, it's not right.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.934
I want no part of it.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.023
That is unfortunate.

10:07.064 --> 10:10.026
But take comfort, my dear,

10:10.067 --> 10:12.403
your days of disappointing
your mother...

10:15.656 --> 10:16.824
...are at an end.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.410
Wren!

10:19.452 --> 10:21.829
- Wren!
- ( grunting )

10:21.871 --> 10:23.372
Mother, please!

10:24.957 --> 10:26.876
( grunting )

10:30.588 --> 10:34.091
Wren?
Wren, your wrist.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.029
( gasps )

11:07.458 --> 11:11.504
- Oh, Mother.
- Daughter.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.713
All is forgiven.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.098
I'm glad it was with you.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.352
I shared my last gift.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.669
You see,
he is still with us.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.715
Yes, I feel his presence.

11:55.756 --> 12:00.094
We were wrong, Janzo.
We were so wrong.

12:00.136 --> 12:04.557
A mind expanding in ways
we never could have imagined.

12:04.598 --> 12:08.352
Not only peace,
but knowledge.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.814
Its potential is limitless.
You must experience this
for yourself.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.649
No, thank you.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.193
Oh, you don't have to
be brave, Janzo.

12:16.235 --> 12:20.114
- No.
- You don't have to
fight it anymore.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.743
You can be united
with more intelligence
and more strength

12:23.784 --> 12:25.953
than you've ever known.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.455
You can be at one with me.

12:27.496 --> 12:30.499
But, Wren, this isn't you.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.835
It's still me, Janzo.
I'm still Wren.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.090
He has the other syringe.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.217
He wants to take you
from the United.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.762
Don't you see, Janzo?
I want to be here.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.599
Join us.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.353
- Munt.
- ( yelling )

12:55.983 --> 12:57.777
Run, Janzo!

13:00.237 --> 13:02.448
- Wren, you would kill me?
- Of course not.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.082
- ( screaming )
- Drop the syringe, Janzo.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.044
Munt!

13:34.897 --> 13:37.691
This is good, Janzo.

13:37.733 --> 13:38.943
You should try it.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.321
( whimpers )

13:43.531 --> 13:44.949
Drop it.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.672
( grunting )

13:59.713 --> 14:01.215
- Janzo!
- Let him go.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.891
He won't get far.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.486
( screaming )

14:22.528 --> 14:23.487
Please don't kill me! No!

14:23.529 --> 14:25.656
No! Please don't kill me!

14:27.533 --> 14:29.118
No. Stop!

14:29.159 --> 14:31.871
Stand back! Stay away!

14:31.912 --> 14:33.080
Stay away! Stay away!

14:33.122 --> 14:35.541
Back! Stand back!

14:35.583 --> 14:37.084
Please, no!

14:40.713 --> 14:41.630
Talon!

14:44.800 --> 14:46.510
- Where's Munt?
- He and Wren were infected
by Yavalla.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.262
( yelling, grunting )

14:48.304 --> 14:50.139
There's too many of them!

14:51.557 --> 14:53.726
They're not gonna stop
until we're infected.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.811
- Let's go!
- ( yelling )

15:00.065 --> 15:02.568
Keep going!
I'll be right behind you!

15:05.863 --> 15:06.906
Zed, what are you doing?

15:09.074 --> 15:11.994
My incendiary device.

15:12.036 --> 15:12.995
Let's go.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.540
( screaming )

15:38.604 --> 15:39.897
I think we lost them.

15:42.608 --> 15:43.817
( hawk screeching )

15:45.235 --> 15:46.820
There's Yavalla's eye
in the sky.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.990
We have to hide or
she'll just keep sending more.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.677
Over here.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.556
Talon?

16:27.069 --> 16:29.363
So, what now?

16:36.745 --> 16:39.039
Garret:
A new wall built half
a league from the main,

16:39.081 --> 16:41.625
would incorporate over
330 acres of farmland

16:41.667 --> 16:44.086
currently abandoned
because of the epidemic.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.256
And that would allow us
to replenish our food stores
under Outpost protection.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.718
A new wall?
Isn't that a massive
undertaking?

16:50.759 --> 16:53.220
- Yes, it is.
- Do we have the resources?

16:53.262 --> 16:56.390
Well, we can use the rocks
from the quarry the Blackbloods
forced us to reopen.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.392
And do our people have
strength of will

16:58.434 --> 17:00.060
after everything
they've been through?

17:00.102 --> 17:02.354
Most of them are skin and bone,
their spirits threadbare.

17:02.396 --> 17:06.233
It's times like these
people long for a purpose
more than ever.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.611
I'm impressed.
We'll draw up plans immediately.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.702
Garret,
thank you for your help.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.872
Especially since I didn't ask
for any of this.

17:19.913 --> 17:23.876
It's all right.
I mean, I should be fighting
alongside Talon and Zed,

17:23.917 --> 17:27.588
but since I can't,
I decided to focus on
being a help to you.

17:27.629 --> 17:31.383
Well, your contribution
is much appreciated.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.431
And what about you?

17:37.473 --> 17:38.515
How are you faring?

17:38.557 --> 17:39.975
I'm fine.

17:43.562 --> 17:48.358
Gwynn,
you've been through a lot
the past few weeks.

17:48.400 --> 17:52.196
Used by the Priestess,
literally killed

17:52.237 --> 17:54.198
and brought back to life,
and then--

17:54.239 --> 17:58.577
Losing Tobin. Yes.

17:58.619 --> 18:02.331
It'll make for a rather
riveting diary entry, won't it?

18:02.372 --> 18:05.209
You know, the strangest thing
of all is how much I found
myself missing it.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.795
It's not strange.
You were betrothed to him.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.714
No, not Tobin.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.509
The United.

18:13.550 --> 18:16.178
I can't explain it.
It really was a kind
of paradise.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.430
Gwynn, it--
it would have killed you.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.974
I know.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.519
I knew it at the time
and still wouldn't have left it

18:23.560 --> 18:25.312
had I been given the chance.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.734
It's a frightening thought,
isn't it?

18:30.776 --> 18:31.693
Yes.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.280
Well, I know what it's like

18:35.322 --> 18:40.953
to be lost in something
that is insidious

18:40.994 --> 18:43.789
- and intoxicating.
- Oh, Garret.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.500
I never thought I'd be able
to fully forgive you

18:46.542 --> 18:49.336
after what you did under
the Prime Order's control.

18:49.378 --> 18:53.257
But now I've experienced
something similar myself,
I-- I feel--

18:53.298 --> 18:55.050
You don't have
to say any more.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.845
I understand.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.477
Gwynn, I'm--
I'm with Talon now.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.564
I know.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.107
I just wanted a hug
from an old friend.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.780
- I am happy for you and Talon.
- ( footsteps approaching )

19:16.822 --> 19:18.615
There's no two people
I'd rather see happy.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.992
( door opens )

19:21.410 --> 19:23.370
Forgive me, Your Majesty,

19:23.412 --> 19:25.956
but Lord Tobin has returned
with his army.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.666
They've brought food
from Aegisford.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.504
( cheering )

19:46.643 --> 19:48.770
Tobin:
People of Gallwood Outpost,

19:48.812 --> 19:52.024
though my beloved home
has been taken by the infected,

19:52.065 --> 19:55.611
my army was able
to successfully raid
the Aegisford store houses,

19:55.652 --> 19:58.405
securing a bulk
of their reserves for you.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.490
( cheering )

20:00.532 --> 20:02.868
Your days of starvation
are past.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.498
May Gallwood Outpost forever
stand as a refuge of hope

20:08.540 --> 20:10.375
against the outside world!

20:22.971 --> 20:24.848
Why in the gods
did you and Wren think

20:24.890 --> 20:28.060
it was a good idea to
take on Yavalla yourselves?

20:28.101 --> 20:32.439
We found some long-extinct
Ficter's sap left behind on
the map from the meld box.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.442
Turned out to rid one of
her followers at the Outpost of
his kinj without killing him,

20:35.484 --> 20:38.946
so we thought it was a way
to stop Yavalla without
killing her.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.992
Even if the chance was slim,

20:44.034 --> 20:45.202
I couldn't begrudge
my Wren trying.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.871
I gather it didn't work?

20:47.913 --> 20:49.665
Unfortunately not.

20:49.706 --> 20:50.791
It seems it only works
on her followers,

20:50.832 --> 20:52.834
not Yavalla's original kinj.

20:54.544 --> 20:55.629
Like Zed's kinj does.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.926
Talon.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.803
We have to go back for
Wren and Munt.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.763
Wren and Munt are gone.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.892
Only hope of saving them now
is burning Yavalla to an ash.

21:08.934 --> 21:12.813
I'm sorry,
are we forgetting something,
Mister Fire-happy? Huh?

21:12.854 --> 21:15.107
How about the part
where I already made you
an incendiary device,

21:15.148 --> 21:17.484
and then you just went off
and wasted it again?

21:17.526 --> 21:21.113
Oh, yes. To save your life.
You're welcome.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.240
Yes, and it was quite
an essential part of
your plan, wasn't it,

21:23.282 --> 21:26.535
seeing as stabbing
a woman through the heart
has proven ineffectual?

21:26.576 --> 21:28.287
What's your plan
of action now, huh?

21:28.328 --> 21:31.123
- Can't you just make us
another one?
- ( Janzo laughs )

21:31.164 --> 21:33.500
Make another one?
Make another incendiary device
out here?

21:33.542 --> 21:35.168
Sure, sure.
What do you want me to do?

21:35.210 --> 21:37.587
Just-- just pyrolize some
willow branches, do you?

21:37.629 --> 21:40.299
Or make a clay pot? I know.
How about I just go and--

21:40.340 --> 21:43.427
go and boil down some
of the salt from
the hot springs we passed?

21:43.468 --> 21:45.512
Or how about
I just fractionate

21:45.554 --> 21:47.681
some of this bat guano
that we're sitting in, huh?

21:49.850 --> 21:50.475
Can you actually do that?

21:54.771 --> 21:56.148
My genius even surprises me
sometimes.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.943
It's really quite bloody simple,
isn't it?

21:59.985 --> 22:01.737
All I have to do
is just grind it all up

22:01.778 --> 22:03.530
to a two-three-fifteen
weight ratio

22:03.572 --> 22:05.741
and then insert a fuse
made out of tree bark

22:05.782 --> 22:07.409
and lace it with fruit sugar.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.368
( squeals )

22:12.539 --> 22:14.916
I don't understand why
you're so upset.

22:14.958 --> 22:18.337
We risked life and limb and
more than a few close calls
with infected

22:18.378 --> 22:21.173
to bring food
to your starving subjects.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.966
Rosmund,
I did this for you.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.052
For me?

22:25.093 --> 22:27.346
Or for your and Falista's
own glory?

22:27.387 --> 22:30.307
- What?
- You left with an army,

22:30.349 --> 22:31.475
an army that
was pledged to me,

22:31.516 --> 22:32.851
with no word
of an explanation.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.145
Your return
was equally unannounced,

22:35.187 --> 22:38.357
making me look like a desperate
and ignorant leader

22:38.398 --> 22:40.984
fortunate enough to have
such bold and mighty allies

22:41.026 --> 22:42.652
like the Baron and Baroness.

22:42.694 --> 22:45.197
Clearly, Falista's
positioned you and herself

22:45.238 --> 22:46.615
are the great saviors
of this Outpost.

22:46.656 --> 22:47.657
Rosmund,
you're being paranoid.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.993
I don't think I am.

22:50.035 --> 22:53.372
Look, Tobin,
in the last few weeks,

22:53.413 --> 22:57.376
you and I have both gone
to paradise and hell and back.

22:57.417 --> 23:00.128
I don't know about you,
but it's left me with
no patience for games.

23:01.963 --> 23:06.051
All I crave is plain speaking
and the actions to back it up,

23:06.093 --> 23:10.013
though something tells me
I'm lecturing the wrong half
of your Barony about this.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.556
Please,
stop bringing Falista
into this.

23:11.598 --> 23:14.393
I'm not the one
that brought her into this.

23:14.434 --> 23:19.314
Rosmund,
you want plain-speaking?
Here it is.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.066
I love you.

23:21.108 --> 23:24.611
I am loyal to you
and only you.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.698
I want nothing more than
your happiness and safety.

23:33.870 --> 23:37.833
In return for your provisions,
Lord Aegisford,

23:37.874 --> 23:39.084
I'd like to give you a gift.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.427
Your wife should have
your mother's ring.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.264
Please give it to her
with my thanks.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.934
I trust you can see
yourself out.

24:09.656 --> 24:14.661
( ghostly whispering )

24:14.703 --> 24:17.164
There is a common enemy
out there.

24:17.205 --> 24:19.666
Yavalla will enslave us all
and send us to an early grave

24:19.708 --> 24:22.210
if we do not learn
how to stand together.

24:22.252 --> 24:26.465
I need every able-bodied,
uninfected man we can get.

24:26.506 --> 24:29.926
How did they bring Rosmund
back from death?

24:35.974 --> 24:39.352
She's the woman
that you used to call Two.

24:39.394 --> 24:42.898
Look at her.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.859
Captive.
Just an ordinary woman.
She is not a god.

24:50.947 --> 24:53.158
I shall keep an eye out
on this Two.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.579
She may prove useful.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.173
Thank you for seeing me,
Your Majesty.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.299
Did you like the ring?

25:10.550 --> 25:11.468
Ring?

25:13.929 --> 25:16.723
Never mind.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.142
I wanted to thank you
personally

25:19.184 --> 25:22.354
for your efforts
on behalf of my people.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.314
It's Lord Tobin
who deserves your thanks.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.066
I was merely along
for the ride.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.442
Well, I doubt that.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.361
My adopted father once told me

25:29.402 --> 25:31.738
that a good man
aspiring to be great

25:31.780 --> 25:33.490
must choose his wife
carefully.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.534
Lord Tobin's clearly
done that with you.

25:35.575 --> 25:40.372
Well, I'm glad you and I
both see Lord Tobin
the same way-- a good man.

25:40.413 --> 25:43.291
Which is why the request
I've come to make shouldn't be
too difficult for you.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.168
Yes?

25:45.210 --> 25:47.003
I understand
your Chief Advisor was killed

25:47.045 --> 25:50.048
during the Prime Order attack
on the Outpost.

25:50.090 --> 25:54.177
That's correct.
She was an uncommonly
shrewd woman.

25:54.219 --> 25:57.430
My condolences.
And she hasn't yet
been replaced?

25:57.472 --> 26:00.392
- No.
- Well...

26:00.433 --> 26:02.477
I'm sure both you and I agree
that Lord Tobin

26:02.519 --> 26:04.062
would be the obvious choice
for the job.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.774
- Baroness--
- Please, call me Falista.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.609
I don't think
that's a good idea.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.194
Appointing Lord Tobin
as Chief Advisor

26:11.236 --> 26:12.779
or calling me
by my given name?

26:12.821 --> 26:18.201
- Neither. Both.
- Why, Your Majesty?

26:18.243 --> 26:20.996
He has proven himself
on the battlefield

26:21.037 --> 26:25.208
and he has shown his loyalty
to you in countless ways.

26:25.250 --> 26:29.421
- Do you not trust him?
- Oh, I trust him completely.

26:29.462 --> 26:32.591
- Then what is it then?
- To be quite frank,
Baroness, it's you.

26:32.632 --> 26:35.594
- Me?
- Why are you doing this
for him?

26:35.635 --> 26:38.346
Is it not so you can have
more influence?

26:38.388 --> 26:40.599
Strengthen your connection
to royalty?

26:40.640 --> 26:44.686
Oh, are you not aware,
Your Majesty?

26:44.728 --> 26:48.023
- I am royal myself.
- Oh?

26:48.064 --> 26:52.444
My father's great-uncle's cousin
was Kelton the Green,

26:52.485 --> 26:54.613
nephew to Rayner of Ostrib,

26:54.654 --> 27:00.243
whose great-grandson
was Ranulf, your father.

27:00.285 --> 27:04.039
So, you and I are cousins
in one way or another.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.208
Fascinating.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.586
I've had it all documented
by the chronologists,
of course.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.047
- Well, I'm sure you do.
- It's not as if I go around

27:12.088 --> 27:13.590
making a point of it
to everyone.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.133
No, just those
you wish to threaten.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.886
Not at all, Your Majesty.

27:19.888 --> 27:23.391
I love Tobin.
I want him to be happy.

27:23.433 --> 27:26.686
And he is happiest when
he has an important job to do.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.773
Besides, I would have thought

27:29.814 --> 27:32.692
you'd have been above
such pettiness

27:32.734 --> 27:34.861
and would choose the right man
for the job.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.447
- Pettiness?
- Yes.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.533
You can't handle the man
you still love

27:40.575 --> 27:43.662
working long hours
in close quarters

27:43.703 --> 27:47.582
knowing you can't have him.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.542
Knowing he's married to me.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.506
Honestly, I can't understand
why you would want that,

27:54.547 --> 27:57.634
given we both know
which of us the man prefers.

28:02.972 --> 28:05.183
- Ow! What was that?
- You all right?

28:05.225 --> 28:08.019
- Well, what do you mean?
- The pain. That--
that was unbearable.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.522
Thank you for the wine,
Your Majesty.

28:10.563 --> 28:13.358
I do hope you give my request
the consideration it deserves.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.666
There.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.751
Finished.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.966
So we're going to burn Yavalla
to death with a pumpkin?

28:40.218 --> 28:41.553
Will it work as well
as the others?

28:41.594 --> 28:44.139
Can't guarantee that,
can I, Zed?

28:44.180 --> 28:47.600
One has a laboratory full
of carefully curated tools
and supplies for a reason.

28:47.642 --> 28:50.854
However,
being the Janzo that I am,

28:50.895 --> 28:55.775
yes, it should supply
no shortage of flame
and heat for us.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.444
Good work, Janzo.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.158
You're welcome?

29:03.199 --> 29:05.618
Garret:
In addition to screening
the new arrivals,

29:05.660 --> 29:07.537
we're also inspecting
the residents.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.873
And since Janzo discovered
Yavalla's use of livestock,

29:09.914 --> 29:11.499
we're inspecting
the animals as well.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.960
We're taking measures to control
the rodent population,

29:14.002 --> 29:16.254
and we even have a team
watching for birds.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.381
That's very good.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.176
I suspect the longer the Outpost
remains free of the United,

29:21.217 --> 29:24.137
the more of a target
it'll become.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.346
( sighs )

29:27.015 --> 29:30.393
Pray that Zed and Talon
are successful on their mission.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.771
You sound doubtful.

29:32.812 --> 29:35.774
Well, Yavalla grows stronger
with every mind that's
added to hers.

29:35.815 --> 29:40.737
By now she could be
truly unstoppable.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.781
I didn't mean to make you
worry for Talon.

29:42.822 --> 29:46.826
No, no. If anyone can
stop the unstoppable,
it's-- it's Talon.

29:46.868 --> 29:50.914
I just-- I just wish
I was out there with her,
that's all.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.541
Well, she'll find a way.
She always does.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.085
- Yeah.
- And for now it's useful
having you here.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.176
Rosmund:
Get off of me!

30:06.054 --> 30:10.475
Rosmund,
back from the dead.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.435
Back from the dead.

30:15.146 --> 30:19.025
You cannot escape
your destiny.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.695
You will rejoin me
before long.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.380
I should never have
let you get that close
to the uninspected.

30:40.421 --> 30:42.465
Are you sure
you're all right?

30:42.507 --> 30:44.676
Yes.
Thanks to your quick action.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.845
It sickens me,
having to kill them every time.

30:46.886 --> 30:49.264
They're innocent.

30:49.305 --> 30:53.685
Garret, I need to appoint
a new Chief Advisor.

30:53.726 --> 30:56.271
What do you think
of Tobin for the job?

30:56.312 --> 30:59.107
He's loyal,
a natural leader.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.817
I think he's
an excellent choice.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.194
Yes, he is.

31:05.738 --> 31:08.491
But he's also
your former betrothed.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.869
I don't want my personal
feelings getting in the way

31:10.910 --> 31:13.705
of any important decisions
in either direction.

31:13.746 --> 31:16.165
Sometimes what's
best for you personally

31:16.207 --> 31:18.710
is what's best for the Realm.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.205
Good night, my daughter.

32:03.129 --> 32:04.714
Now's our chance.

32:05.798 --> 32:08.009
Stay here.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.260
We'll get you
when it's safe.

32:28.404 --> 32:31.699
Talon, Zed, I missed you.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.376
Welcome back.

32:43.044 --> 32:47.382
Ugh. Your need for conflict
appears endless.

32:47.423 --> 32:48.925
When will you stop fighting,

32:48.967 --> 32:51.636
embrace the peace
we are all meant for?

32:51.678 --> 32:53.262
The peace you offer
is death.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.306
So we brought you
some peace of our own.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.600
( chuckles )
Oh, Zed.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.978
Have you not learned?

33:00.019 --> 33:02.397
Your weapons
are ineffective on me.

33:02.438 --> 33:04.983
We'll see about that.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.943
Enjoy paradise, Priestess.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.156
( screaming )

33:14.951 --> 33:17.203
( grunting )

33:28.464 --> 33:30.049
( screaming )

33:30.091 --> 33:31.718
It looks like they've lost
their connection to her.

33:31.759 --> 33:32.760
( gasps )

33:32.802 --> 33:35.972
( screaming )

33:36.014 --> 33:38.349
- Cut off her head!
- I can't see her head.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.517
Aim it high!

33:40.893 --> 33:41.936
( yelling )

33:50.361 --> 33:53.364
- You think it worked?
- It had to.

34:13.885 --> 34:14.969
You came back?

34:15.011 --> 34:17.138
Yes.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.058
I'm ready to join you
in the United.

34:20.099 --> 34:23.770
No, you're not.
You still think I need saving.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.438
What do you mean?

34:25.480 --> 34:27.857
Is that the syringe
of Ficter's sap
in you hand or not?

34:30.777 --> 34:32.904
You mean too much to me, Wren.

34:32.945 --> 34:35.698
- How can I not want
to save you?
- Save me from what, Janzo?

34:35.740 --> 34:37.742
Enlightenment?

34:37.784 --> 34:40.244
I want to be with you,
but you must join me here.

34:42.121 --> 34:46.375
Then if that's the only way
to be with you, I'll do it.

34:47.627 --> 34:48.544
Really?

34:53.591 --> 34:54.884
Really.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.401
I'm so happy
you're choosing this, Janzo.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.905
- Hmm.
- You won't regret it.

35:18.241 --> 35:21.160
( music playing )

35:38.886 --> 35:41.639
Janzo?

35:41.681 --> 35:43.349
- Janzo?
- The syringe you destroyed

35:43.391 --> 35:45.143
was the empty one
that you used on Yavalla.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.854
I just filled it back up with
mashed berries and pine sap.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.406
- Janzo?
- Wren?

35:58.447 --> 35:59.657
Oh.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.744
- You're you again?
- Mm-hmm.

36:03.786 --> 36:04.704
Mm, mm.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.332
We've got to go.

36:15.673 --> 36:18.593
( whimpering )

36:18.634 --> 36:22.388
Munt?
Munt, I had to choose Wren.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.182
I promise we'll save you.

36:33.608 --> 36:36.527
- Did it work?
- I think so.

36:36.569 --> 36:39.822
- Is she--
- The Ficter's sap worked.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.492
Gods above.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.882
( music playing )

37:00.635 --> 37:04.597
You cannot kill a god.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.397
They refuse to unite with us
in paradise.

37:16.609 --> 37:17.526
Kill them all.

37:31.707 --> 37:34.877
Defend our Unity.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.712
Kill the deniers.

37:39.048 --> 37:40.299
( grunting )

37:40.341 --> 37:43.177
( Munt yelling )

37:43.219 --> 37:44.136
Here we go.

37:49.308 --> 37:50.226
Talon: Munt.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.855
- Don't make me kill you.
- Munt!

37:54.897 --> 37:57.316
This way! This way!
There's a back way out!

38:02.029 --> 38:03.531
Come on.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.120
Munt.

38:09.161 --> 38:11.205
I'm sorry, brother.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.332
I'll keep to my word,
I promise!

38:20.589 --> 38:23.509
( music playing )

38:46.449 --> 38:49.327
Rosmund:
It's in times like these when
even the smallest of measures

38:49.368 --> 38:52.621
can mean the difference between
salvation and extinction.

38:52.663 --> 38:55.333
It's more important than ever
that as your queen,

38:55.374 --> 38:57.126
I have a trusted advisor
by my side.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.964
A bold military leader
in his own right,

39:02.006 --> 39:03.257
selfless and loyal,

39:03.299 --> 39:05.718
I am confident
that he will lead us

39:05.760 --> 39:07.553
from the mere salvation
of survival

39:07.595 --> 39:11.515
to a bastion of strength
and defiance

39:11.557 --> 39:13.726
against the forces
that threaten our world.

39:13.768 --> 39:18.272
I present to you
my new Chief Advisor...

39:18.314 --> 39:19.857
Captain Garret Spears.

39:19.899 --> 39:23.694
( cheers and applause )

39:56.268 --> 39:59.939
Falista: I'm sorry, Tobin.
You're ten times the man he is.

39:59.980 --> 40:03.359
Who is Spears anyway?
No lineage, no title.

40:03.401 --> 40:07.071
Seems being Rosmund's
childhood sweetheart was
his top qualification.

40:07.113 --> 40:10.408
Spears is more than qualified.

40:10.449 --> 40:13.327
- He's a good man.
- And you're an even better one.

40:13.369 --> 40:17.623
- You deserved that position.
- Rosmund owes me nothing.

40:17.665 --> 40:18.624
I serve at her command.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.252
Maybe if you talk
to Spears himself--

40:21.293 --> 40:23.546
Enough!

40:23.587 --> 40:27.091
Stop fixing this!
Stop handling me!

40:31.095 --> 40:32.847
I took this sort of
manipulation from Gertrusha

40:32.888 --> 40:35.850
from when I was a kid
to I'd long past outgrown it.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.059
And then I had
that Blackblood,

40:37.101 --> 40:39.603
that witch, in my head

40:39.645 --> 40:41.564
controlling my every move.

40:41.605 --> 40:45.776
Falista, I'm not sure
how much more I can take.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.862
I'm sorry.

40:47.903 --> 40:49.655
I wasn't trying
to be controlling.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.741
I just-- I just want
what's best for you.

40:52.783 --> 40:55.661
I know.

40:55.703 --> 40:56.871
And I'm sorry I shouted.

40:58.372 --> 41:00.040
But if I'm to make my mark
in this world,

41:00.082 --> 41:02.293
it can't be by your hand,
Falista.

41:02.334 --> 41:03.461
It has to be on my own terms.

41:09.425 --> 41:13.471
The traitors have severed
my daughter from our Unity.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.681
They have stolen her away.

41:15.723 --> 41:20.686
They have tried once more
to kill your god.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.855
As you have seen,

41:22.897 --> 41:27.193
I cannot die.

41:27.234 --> 41:31.864
Gallwood Outpost is now
the greatest threat to peace
in our world.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.700
We must prepare to show them

41:34.742 --> 41:38.204
the power of the United.

41:40.414 --> 41:43.000
All:
Yavalla, praised be she.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.920
Yavalla, praised be she.

41:45.961 --> 41:48.714
Yavalla, praised be she.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.509
Yavalla, praised be she.

41:51.550 --> 41:53.928
Yavalla, praised be she.

41:53.969 --> 41:56.847
Yavalla, praised be she.
