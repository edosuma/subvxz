WEBVTT

00:00.145 --> 00:02.027
Previously on Californication...

00:02.147 --> 00:03.996
So what, you guys are doing it now?

00:04.116 --> 00:05.415
It's none of your business.

00:05.434 --> 00:07.620
Pearl's learning how to drive right now.
Ben's teaching her.

00:07.740 --> 00:09.115
Got a little black Jesus.

00:09.235 --> 00:10.964
Did he turn water into whiskey too?

00:11.084 --> 00:13.338
- Sasha is back on board.
- Why?

00:13.458 --> 00:14.447
Eddie Nero's on board.

00:14.567 --> 00:16.492
Let's do some drinking.
Let's talk some story.

00:16.526 --> 00:18.027
I'm a writer, Sasha,

00:18.061 --> 00:19.495
not a fuck toy.

00:19.529 --> 00:21.263
Now you know.

00:21.298 --> 00:23.899
Stu done knocked me up.
I am indeed with child.

00:23.934 --> 00:25.568
I've had a couple
of vasectomies.

00:25.602 --> 00:26.702
What exactly are you saying?

00:26.736 --> 00:29.405
There still could
be swimmers in his junk?

00:29.439 --> 00:30.839
You still have feelings
for her, don't you?

00:30.874 --> 00:32.775
That's what you're mad about?

00:35.545 --> 00:36.712
Oh, sorry!

00:36.746 --> 00:38.247
You saw Hank Moody
having a conversation

00:38.281 --> 00:41.684
with your daughter prior
to the night of August 13th?

00:41.718 --> 00:43.352
Yes.

00:43.386 --> 00:44.687
That jury is now under
the assumption

00:44.721 --> 00:46.455
that you knew Mia before
you actually slept together.

00:46.489 --> 00:48.557
This changes everything.

00:48.592 --> 00:50.392
- Fuck.
- Guilty?

00:50.427 --> 00:51.660
- Yeah.
- So what does that mean?

00:51.695 --> 00:53.062
Is he going to jail?

00:53.096 --> 00:54.063
I don't know, honey.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.431
What do we do now?

00:55.465 --> 00:57.032
Let's go get shitfaced.

00:57.067 --> 00:59.335
Counselor.

01:09.746 --> 01:13.682
Mr. Moody,
before I commence sentencing,

01:13.717 --> 01:16.018
do you have anything
you'd like to say for yourself?

01:16.052 --> 01:18.554
Yes, I do, your honor.

01:18.588 --> 01:21.390
But I'm not sure it would move
you one way or the other.

01:21.424 --> 01:23.258
Begging for mercy
is not my style

01:23.293 --> 01:26.762
and to do so at this stage
would be disingenuous anyway.

01:26.796 --> 01:28.230
The only thing that
I'm truly sorry for

01:28.264 --> 01:31.634
is embarrassing my daughter
and her mother.

01:31.668 --> 01:33.035
Everything else is just noise.

01:33.069 --> 01:35.971
Plain and simple.

01:36.006 --> 01:37.840
Thank you, your honor.

01:37.874 --> 01:42.077
Oh, and free
the West Memphis three.

01:42.112 --> 01:44.079
Okay.

01:48.451 --> 01:52.755
Well, let's get on with it.

01:52.789 --> 01:56.358
Mr. Moody, you are
a tragic disappointment.

01:56.393 --> 01:59.128
You behave like an animal.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.864
You live in flagrant defiance

02:01.898 --> 02:04.366
of the rules of our society.

02:04.401 --> 02:08.237
I have no doubt that you have
done some good in your life

02:08.270 --> 02:09.872
as the many letters asking
for leniency

02:09.906 --> 02:11.874
on your behalf do state.

02:11.908 --> 02:15.611
You have been found guilty
of statutory rape,

02:15.645 --> 02:19.415
but the real crime here
is not one of moral turpitude.

02:19.449 --> 02:23.819
Your true crime is that
you seem committed

02:23.853 --> 02:26.221
to squandering your gifts
and wasting

02:26.256 --> 02:30.159
what appears to be
a rewarding life.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.928
You have a young daughter.

02:32.962 --> 02:35.864
I am forced to consider
what time without a father

02:35.899 --> 02:38.467
does to a prisoner's daughter.

02:38.501 --> 02:40.803
On the count of statutory rape,

02:40.837 --> 02:44.840
I hereby sentence you
to three years.

02:57.554 --> 02:58.887
Hank.

02:58.922 --> 02:59.955
Hello?

02:59.989 --> 03:01.957
Ow.

03:01.991 --> 03:03.826
What happened?

03:03.860 --> 03:05.094
You fainted.

03:05.128 --> 03:07.329
I fainted?
Like a little girl?

03:07.363 --> 03:08.330
Pretty much, yeah.

03:08.364 --> 03:10.165
What a pussy I am.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.967
You said it.
I just thought it.

03:12.001 --> 03:15.170
Are they gonna come and take
me away in handcuffs now?

03:15.205 --> 03:16.805
I don't think so.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.507
Why not?
I got three years, didn't I?

03:18.541 --> 03:19.908
Yes, you did.

03:19.943 --> 03:21.510
Probation.

03:21.544 --> 03:22.745
No jail time?

03:22.779 --> 03:24.813
No jail time.

03:29.552 --> 03:31.186
Say it again.

03:31.221 --> 03:33.021
Three years probation,

03:33.056 --> 03:35.491
$25,000 fine, and 288 hours

03:35.525 --> 03:37.426
of community service.

03:37.460 --> 03:40.329
Oh, never have
I been so excited

03:40.363 --> 03:42.231
to write a huge check
and service the community

03:42.265 --> 03:43.499
for 12 days.

03:43.533 --> 03:45.768
You are a lucky man,
Hank Moody.

03:45.802 --> 03:47.102
And pretty good at math too.

03:47.137 --> 03:48.470
Oh, yeah, I am.

03:48.505 --> 03:50.172
I won the Math-Off
in fourth grade.

03:50.206 --> 03:51.240
Really?

03:51.274 --> 03:54.009
Talk about a panty-peeler.

03:54.043 --> 03:56.011
First day of the rest
of your life.

03:56.045 --> 03:57.646
What are you gonna do with it?

03:57.680 --> 03:59.748
Oh, I think I'm doing it.

03:59.783 --> 04:01.283
Get up here.

former counselor?

05:07.750 --> 05:10.352
Am I ready to attend
a fancy Hollywood party?

05:10.386 --> 05:13.355
No, are you ready
to walk into said party

05:13.389 --> 05:15.324
with me on your arm
and say to the world,

05:15.358 --> 05:16.625

05:21.531 --> 05:23.498

are you ready?

05:23.533 --> 05:24.967
- Oh.
- Hmm?

05:25.001 --> 05:26.368
I think maybe we should
go back to the hotel,

05:26.402 --> 05:28.303
lock the door, and knock
some more boots.

05:28.338 --> 05:30.806
I have a pretty good idea
what that's about,

05:30.840 --> 05:32.741
but I have no idea what
it's like to attend

05:32.775 --> 05:33.809
a social event with you.

05:33.843 --> 05:35.277
Oh, oddly enough, very similar.

05:35.311 --> 05:36.445
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:36.479 --> 05:37.746
Either way,
somebody gets fucked.

05:37.780 --> 05:38.780
Oh.

05:38.815 --> 05:41.783
♪ Turn on, tune in ♪

05:41.818 --> 05:44.253
Wow.
You move fast.

05:44.287 --> 05:46.088
Or is this

05:46.122 --> 05:47.389
how you're paying off
your bill?

05:47.423 --> 05:49.992
Gee, Ben.

05:50.026 --> 05:52.527
What's up?

05:54.430 --> 05:56.398
Sorry.
That's fucked up.

05:56.432 --> 05:58.000
Uh, Ben, Abby.

05:58.034 --> 05:59.368
- Abby...
- How are you?

05:59.402 --> 06:02.070
This is Karen's new chill,
black bohemian lover.

06:02.105 --> 06:04.539
"Blackhemian."

06:04.574 --> 06:06.942
Is that a word?
Coining it.

06:06.976 --> 06:08.577
You can totally hit him.

06:08.611 --> 06:10.045
You know...
you know what?

06:10.079 --> 06:11.580
The only reason
why I never took a swing

06:11.614 --> 06:13.916
is because I was too busy
feeling sorry for you,

06:13.950 --> 06:16.685
and I was pretty fucking
sure you were going to jail.

06:16.719 --> 06:18.086
And, you know,
what kind of asshole

06:18.121 --> 06:20.489
kicks a man when he's down?

06:20.523 --> 06:22.024
But you're pretty much
out of trouble, right?

06:22.058 --> 06:23.558
Yeah, but
I'm three years' probation,

06:23.593 --> 06:25.494
so if you want to tussle,
it's got to be on the D-L.

06:25.528 --> 06:26.995
But I don't want to tussle.

06:27.030 --> 06:28.263
I don't want to scrap.

06:28.298 --> 06:29.598
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

06:29.632 --> 06:32.534
Can I just shoot him instead?

06:32.568 --> 06:34.236
Too many witnesses.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.371
But I'd be more than happy
to defend you.

06:36.406 --> 06:38.974
Uh, I think I'm gonna just
go in and look

06:39.008 --> 06:40.709
and look at
this fabulous house.

06:40.743 --> 06:42.144
All right.

06:42.178 --> 06:46.148
I think I'm gonna join you.

06:46.182 --> 06:48.550
Brother.
What are you doing here?

06:48.584 --> 06:50.719
- Marcy insisted that I come.
- Oh.

06:50.753 --> 06:51.987
She said you wouldn't be here.

06:52.021 --> 06:53.322
And you bring him?

06:53.356 --> 06:54.589
She said to bring a date, yeah.

06:54.624 --> 06:56.358
Oh, okay.
So now you guys are dating.

06:56.392 --> 06:58.260
Last I checked,
you were just friends.

06:58.294 --> 07:01.296
Oh, my God.
Nothing changes.

07:01.331 --> 07:02.898
You got off
so fucking lucky today

07:02.932 --> 07:05.867
and you still are behaving
like a bratty child.

07:05.902 --> 07:07.502
You're right.

07:07.537 --> 07:09.438
Thank you for reeling me in.

07:09.472 --> 07:10.539
Let's hug it out.
Celebrate my good fortune.

07:10.573 --> 07:12.474
Let's not.

07:12.508 --> 07:14.543
- How about you?
- What about me?

07:14.577 --> 07:17.245
Your attorney.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.780
You bring your attorney
and you're making out with her?

07:18.815 --> 07:20.649
Well, yeah,
after what I put her through,

07:20.683 --> 07:22.985
she deserves a party...
And some smooching.

07:23.019 --> 07:24.786
Have you been sleeping
with her all along?

07:26.723 --> 07:29.358
Jesus Christ, Karen.

07:29.392 --> 07:31.293
What... My God.

07:31.327 --> 07:33.996
She is a smart, driven,
career-oriented woman,

07:34.030 --> 07:36.732
and you cast aspersions
on her like that.

07:36.766 --> 07:39.468
A few times, yeah, sure,
we've slept together.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.570
But really it was...
Don't blame her,

07:41.604 --> 07:42.938
because it's a slip
on her part.

07:42.972 --> 07:44.306
And I'm just telling you this
to make you jealous.

07:44.340 --> 07:46.108
- I'm not jealous.
- A little bit.

07:46.142 --> 07:47.743
- Just a little bit, you are.
- Actually, not anymore. No.

07:47.777 --> 07:49.044
Yeah, don't kid a kidder.
Come on, yeah.

07:49.078 --> 07:50.045
And the judge?

07:50.079 --> 07:51.446
Did you sleep with
the judge too?

07:51.481 --> 07:53.482
No, no.
Just a little oral.

07:53.516 --> 07:54.716
- Hmm, nice.
- And some anal.

07:54.751 --> 07:56.685
- It's hard to get the robe up.
- Right.

07:56.719 --> 07:58.653
I need to talk to you
about something.

07:58.688 --> 07:59.788
- Um...
- Go.

07:59.822 --> 08:01.390
- Interesting.
- Later.

08:01.424 --> 08:03.658
Interesting.
Did you two come together?

08:03.693 --> 08:04.760
- No, Charlie.
- No. No, no.

08:04.794 --> 08:06.228
Hank brought his attorney.

08:06.262 --> 08:08.430
And she brought Ben.

08:08.464 --> 08:09.998
Well, at least you
and the Abster

08:10.033 --> 08:11.800
can shag with
no shame now, right?

08:11.834 --> 08:13.201
- Nice.
- What?

08:13.236 --> 08:14.836
- Thank you, Charlie.
- What did I say?

08:14.871 --> 08:16.438
What?

08:16.472 --> 08:17.973
You don't have
to whisper, weirdo.

08:18.007 --> 08:19.841
I'm a big boy.

08:19.876 --> 08:21.276
I can handle it.

08:21.310 --> 08:22.944
I was just telling him
I started my period.

08:22.979 --> 08:25.414
And that cherry poppin' daddy

08:25.448 --> 08:27.449
needs to earn his red wings.

08:27.483 --> 08:28.750
Oh, boy.

08:28.785 --> 08:30.285
This planet that you're from,

08:30.319 --> 08:31.853
how far from the sun
we talking?

08:31.888 --> 08:34.756
Excuse me, fellas.

08:34.791 --> 08:38.427
This bloody little girl scout
needs to plug herself up.

08:38.461 --> 08:40.861
Don't worry, Charlie.

08:40.897 --> 08:44.933
I'll let you pull the string.

08:46.369 --> 08:48.203
<i>Being There...</i>

08:49.705 --> 08:51.873
By Hal Ashby.

08:51.908 --> 08:54.142
This is my homage.

08:59.515 --> 09:01.216
Years of practice.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.517
Hi, Hank Moody.

09:02.552 --> 09:04.653
Oh, hey, Sasha Binghamness.

09:04.687 --> 09:06.354
- How you doing?
- Good.

09:06.389 --> 09:07.722
My man.

09:07.757 --> 09:10.058
Oh.

09:10.093 --> 09:11.760
I'm glad things worked out
for you today.

09:11.794 --> 09:13.061
Yeah, that makes three of us.

09:13.096 --> 09:14.396
I'm including my ass.

09:14.430 --> 09:15.964
He wasn't looking forward
to all that prison cock.

09:15.998 --> 09:18.233
Yeah, no offense,
but I was kind of hoping

09:18.267 --> 09:20.001
they'd lock you up
and throw away the key.

09:20.036 --> 09:22.137
What'd I ever do to you,
you little film brat?

09:22.171 --> 09:23.572
Not a thing.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.073
It's just who wants a writer
on set all the time?

09:25.108 --> 09:27.476
You know, especially one that's
been fucking the leading lady.

09:27.510 --> 09:29.144
I don't need that
kind of competition.

09:29.178 --> 09:30.412
Don't worry about it.

09:30.446 --> 09:31.646
It'll never happen again.

09:31.681 --> 09:32.681
Not even for old time's sake?

09:32.715 --> 09:34.182
No.

09:34.217 --> 09:36.118
Once you fucked my mother,
my vagina pretty much

09:36.152 --> 09:37.185
sealed right up.

09:37.220 --> 09:38.520
Oh, so you're
like a Barbie now?

09:38.554 --> 09:40.222
When it comes to you, yeah.

09:40.256 --> 09:41.490
So you're smooth and hairless

09:41.524 --> 09:42.924
with a little peachy cleft
right there?

09:42.959 --> 09:44.893
I should very much like
to see that someday.

09:44.927 --> 09:46.161
Hope I may.

09:46.195 --> 09:48.096
I've seen it.

09:48.131 --> 09:49.364
It's gorgeous.

09:49.398 --> 09:51.533
It's a "gorgina."

09:51.567 --> 09:53.935
Oh, so you guys are boning now?

09:53.970 --> 09:55.837
Yeah, you know,
ever since that first meeting

09:55.872 --> 09:58.273
where she showed her boobs,
I've been obsessed.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.342
- I'm devoted to those breasteses.
- Yeah.

10:00.376 --> 10:02.277
- I love 'em, Hank.
- Oh, I know.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.179
- I would do anything for them.
- They're pretty spectacular.

10:04.213 --> 10:05.514
Yeah.

10:05.548 --> 10:08.049
Who's ready to make
a motherfucking movie!

10:08.084 --> 10:10.185
Hoo-waa!

10:12.688 --> 10:13.688
Ha!

10:13.723 --> 10:15.790
Hello?

10:15.825 --> 10:18.226
Ladies? Gentlemen?

10:18.261 --> 10:21.963
We have much to celebrate
this evening.

10:21.998 --> 10:23.131
Whoo!

10:23.166 --> 10:26.768
"Whoo," indeed.

10:26.802 --> 10:28.803
The start of the production
of a film

10:28.838 --> 10:30.639
that has been
my passion project

10:30.673 --> 10:32.874
for quite some time now.

10:32.909 --> 10:34.376
<i>Fucking and Punching.</i>

10:34.410 --> 10:37.579
The bravest, most erotic book
I have ever read.

10:37.613 --> 10:38.747
Yeah!

10:38.781 --> 10:40.682
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:40.716 --> 10:43.585
And then there is
my latest passion project,

10:43.619 --> 10:44.619
Marcy Ellen.

10:44.654 --> 10:46.621
Perhaps the bravest,

10:46.656 --> 10:49.224
most erotic woman
I have ever met.

10:49.258 --> 10:50.292
Aw.

10:50.326 --> 10:51.359
Whoo!

10:51.394 --> 10:53.094
Thank you.

10:53.129 --> 10:54.996
Are you gonna toast me
like that one day, Charlie?

10:56.866 --> 10:58.266
Why are you laughing like that?

10:58.301 --> 10:59.668
What? Like what?

10:59.702 --> 11:00.735
Like you're uncomfortable,

11:00.770 --> 11:01.736
which is making me
uncomfortable.

11:01.771 --> 11:03.071
Jesus Christ, Charlie,

11:03.105 --> 11:04.739
don't be such
a misogynist asshole!

11:04.774 --> 11:06.041
Okay. Okay.

11:06.075 --> 11:07.943
Do you remember when
you asked me to tell you

11:07.977 --> 11:09.411
when you're acting
really crazy?

11:09.445 --> 11:10.946
- Mm-hmm.
- Right now.

11:10.980 --> 11:13.014
Okay, I'm sorry.
Kiss me.

11:13.049 --> 11:16.985
Pull my hair.

11:20.223 --> 11:21.223
- Ah.
- Okay.

11:21.257 --> 11:23.291
Okay.

11:23.326 --> 11:25.160
That got my endorphins going.

11:25.194 --> 11:26.561
I'd like to steer
this shit around

11:26.596 --> 11:29.030
to a man that I know.

11:29.065 --> 11:30.932
True blue American hero.

11:30.967 --> 11:31.967
Motherfucking Hank Moody.

11:32.001 --> 11:33.535
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

11:33.569 --> 11:35.437
He's the ballsiest
fucker I have ever

11:35.471 --> 11:37.239
had the pleasure
to man-dance with.

11:37.273 --> 11:38.773
Cheers, comrade.
To you.

11:38.808 --> 11:39.808
<i>Nostrovia.</i>

11:39.842 --> 11:41.109
- <i>Nostrovia.</i>
- <i>Salut.</i>

11:41.143 --> 11:42.510
You're not gonna play me
like that, are you?

11:42.545 --> 11:43.812
Like what, friend?

11:43.846 --> 11:45.046
Like a cross between
Bruce Springsteen

11:45.081 --> 11:46.815
meets Mickey Rourke
in a gay bar?

11:46.849 --> 11:49.317
Is Bruce Springsteen gay?

11:49.352 --> 11:51.319
I'm really glad I came.

11:51.354 --> 11:52.787
Yeah, that's right.

11:52.822 --> 11:54.756
I really know how to show
a girl a good time, don't I?

11:54.790 --> 11:56.925
- Mm-hmm, you do.
- Karen?

11:56.959 --> 11:58.126
Yes?

11:58.160 --> 11:59.327
You planning on coming
to the set at all?

11:59.362 --> 12:00.829
No.

12:00.863 --> 12:02.964
I would like to get
to know the Yin-Yang

12:02.999 --> 12:04.232
between the two of you.

12:04.267 --> 12:06.701
I mean, I understand it
from Hank's POV.

12:06.736 --> 12:08.870
The beauty,
the maternal qualities,

12:08.904 --> 12:12.440
the stems, the hindquarters.

12:12.475 --> 12:15.710
What is it about me?

12:15.745 --> 12:17.212
What keeps you coming back
for more?

12:17.246 --> 12:18.546
Is it the...

12:18.581 --> 12:19.914
Or is it something else?

12:19.949 --> 12:21.650
Is it something that's...

12:21.684 --> 12:23.218
- Neither.
- I can't speak for Karen.

12:23.252 --> 12:25.620
I shouldn't, but it's more
of a heart-cock combo platter

12:25.655 --> 12:27.188
from the Moody deli,
if you know what I'm saying.

12:27.223 --> 12:28.890
- Love the combo.
- What do you think, Ben?

12:28.924 --> 12:30.292
No, nothing.

12:30.326 --> 12:32.627
Yeah, I don't see you really
packing much of either.

12:32.662 --> 12:33.628
Ha!

12:33.663 --> 12:35.330
- Ouch.
- Good one, Ben.

12:36.832 --> 12:39.367
I'm beginning to feel a stirring
in my loins for you, Ben.

12:39.402 --> 12:40.635
Well, listen.
We don't need to work this out

12:40.670 --> 12:42.737
today, Karen, but I would
like to pick your brain

12:42.772 --> 12:44.339
and I think you should consider
opening yourself

12:44.373 --> 12:45.373
up to me sexually.

12:47.310 --> 12:48.843
Are you spoken for?

12:48.878 --> 12:50.211
Jesus crispies, Nero.

12:50.246 --> 12:52.547
Do you see this dreamboat
sitting right next to her?

12:52.581 --> 12:54.382
Let's go easy on the talent
there, Marcy.

12:54.417 --> 12:55.784
I'm so sorry to disrespect you.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.218
You're a handsome man.

12:57.253 --> 12:58.887
That comes with a price,
by the way.

12:58.921 --> 13:00.255
- Testify.
- It does.

13:00.289 --> 13:01.690
I heard that once before.

13:01.724 --> 13:03.224
You should come down
to the set and visit me too.

13:03.259 --> 13:04.826
Got a lot of fans in
the African-American community.

13:04.860 --> 13:06.361
What the fuck does that mean?

13:06.395 --> 13:07.629
- What the fuck?
- It's true.

13:07.663 --> 13:08.930
Studies show.

13:08.964 --> 13:09.998
My manager's done the research.

13:10.032 --> 13:11.399
Respect.

13:11.434 --> 13:12.767
I don't think we'll be able
to make it to set,

13:12.802 --> 13:14.569
'cause we're gonna
leave town tomorrow, so...

13:14.603 --> 13:16.071
What?

13:16.105 --> 13:18.273
That must be my trick ear,
but what'd I hear?

13:18.307 --> 13:19.341
Tomorrow?
Leaving town?

13:19.375 --> 13:20.742
What?

13:20.776 --> 13:22.811
You didn't tell him?

13:22.845 --> 13:23.945
What?

13:23.979 --> 13:25.947
We'll talk about it in private.

13:25.981 --> 13:27.082
Whoa, Karen.
There are no secrets here.

13:27.116 --> 13:28.450
Where you going?
Are you taking Becca?

13:28.484 --> 13:31.119
Yeah, we're taking
the girls on a road trip.

13:31.153 --> 13:32.120
In a car?

13:32.154 --> 13:34.456
In an RV.

13:34.490 --> 13:36.257
- Jesus, that's cozy.
- Yeah.

13:36.292 --> 13:37.292
How do you feel about that,
Hank?

13:37.326 --> 13:38.493
How do I feel about it?

13:38.527 --> 13:39.994
Yeah, how do you feel
about Karen

13:40.029 --> 13:41.963
taking a little road trip
with her boyfriend Benjamin?

13:41.997 --> 13:43.264
I think it's
a fucking solid plan.

13:43.299 --> 13:44.566
What the fuck do I care
anymore?

13:44.600 --> 13:46.034
You are not telling the truth,
Hank Moody,

13:46.068 --> 13:47.369
and that is not like you.

13:47.403 --> 13:49.104
Hank Moody I know
is a truth-telle

13:49.138 --> 13:50.171
soothsayer!

13:51.774 --> 13:54.008
Now, Karen, how do you feel
about this beautiful woman

13:54.043 --> 13:55.276
on his arm?

13:55.311 --> 13:56.644
And by the way,
you're an incredibly

13:56.679 --> 13:57.846
beautiful woman, very sexual.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.147
Are you ovulating right now?

13:59.181 --> 14:01.282
- I just got my period.
- People are trying to eat.

14:01.317 --> 14:03.184
Abby's great.

14:03.219 --> 14:05.453
She's solid.

14:05.488 --> 14:07.288
Very professional.

14:07.323 --> 14:08.957
And, Abby, how do you feel
about competing

14:08.991 --> 14:11.559
with the star-crossed nature
of their relationship?

14:11.594 --> 14:14.162
I haven't really thought
that much about it, Eddie.

14:14.196 --> 14:16.998
I call bullshit on that,
barrister.

14:17.032 --> 14:19.000
But this is just really
our first date, so...

14:19.034 --> 14:20.902
So you haven't slept together?

14:20.936 --> 14:22.904
- You told her?
- Yes.

14:22.938 --> 14:24.839
Just to make her jealous.

14:24.874 --> 14:28.676
Oh, this is so boring!

14:28.711 --> 14:30.445
I wish we were
at the kids' table

14:30.479 --> 14:33.248
and you were finger-banging
me underneath it.

14:33.282 --> 14:35.483
Hey, you want
to mind your manners,

14:35.518 --> 14:36.985
strawberry slutcake?

14:37.019 --> 14:38.219
You're just jealous
'cause you're old

14:38.254 --> 14:40.655
and dried up and you've got
stinky snatch.

14:40.689 --> 14:42.390
Stinky snatch!
Phew!

14:42.425 --> 14:44.592
You might want to curb
your crazy bitch, Charlie.

14:44.627 --> 14:46.327
Hello?

14:46.362 --> 14:48.196
I will have you know that Marcy
is the wettest woman

14:48.230 --> 14:49.597
- I have ever known.
- Hey-o!

14:49.632 --> 14:52.333
I slide right
in every damn time.

14:52.368 --> 14:55.103
Jesus Christ, Stu,
please shut the fuck up.

14:55.137 --> 14:57.572
I get it.
Hormone replacement.

14:57.606 --> 14:58.973
Good for you.

14:59.008 --> 15:00.141
Watch it, okay?

15:00.176 --> 15:02.243
Just don't talk to her
that way.

15:02.278 --> 15:03.912
Why?
Do you still love her?

15:03.946 --> 15:05.547
Of course I do.

15:05.581 --> 15:09.751
Runkle, are you challenging
me right here in my own home?

15:09.785 --> 15:11.419
That's fine.

15:11.454 --> 15:14.088
We will take it outside
and fists will fly, faggot.

15:15.524 --> 15:17.759
Say it again, Charlie.
Tell me you love her.

15:17.793 --> 15:19.327
Of course I love her!

15:19.361 --> 15:21.396
I've always loved her!

15:21.430 --> 15:22.564
The only reason I'm with you

15:22.598 --> 15:25.433
is because I was trying
to sleep with 100 women

15:25.468 --> 15:26.734
so I could forget about her,

15:26.769 --> 15:27.836
but it's impossible!

15:27.870 --> 15:29.437
Forgetting about her, that is.

15:29.472 --> 15:31.339
I think the 100
might be doable.

15:31.373 --> 15:33.608
I've loved her
and I've fucked her for years.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.009
And, okay, so maybe we never,
you know,

15:35.044 --> 15:37.612
got around to playing
brother and sister

15:37.646 --> 15:39.347
holocaust survivors
in the sack, okay?

15:39.381 --> 15:40.849
But that doesn't mean
I didn't love her

15:40.883 --> 15:42.684
with all my heart.

15:42.718 --> 15:44.352
So there.

15:44.386 --> 15:45.954
My man and my agent.

15:48.858 --> 15:50.692
I'm carrying Charlie's baby.

15:50.726 --> 15:52.527
- What?
- Whoa now!

15:52.561 --> 15:56.397
What the fuck?

15:56.432 --> 15:58.166
I had a really weird dream
about that

15:58.200 --> 15:59.801
just the other night, I think.

15:59.835 --> 16:01.202
I will not be trifled with,
Charlie!

16:01.237 --> 16:03.071
Oh!

16:03.105 --> 16:04.706
- Shit!
- Charlie!

16:04.740 --> 16:05.707
Marcy!

16:09.979 --> 16:12.380
Marcy! Oh!

16:12.414 --> 16:14.716
Marcy, the baby!

16:18.621 --> 16:20.421
Ah.

16:20.456 --> 16:22.123
This is giving me a raging hard-on.

16:22.157 --> 16:23.458
Feel it!
Feel it!

16:23.492 --> 16:24.893
Ah! Bitch!

16:24.927 --> 16:26.461
Not sure that's a good idea.

16:26.495 --> 16:27.562
Ah!

16:27.596 --> 16:30.965
Okay.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.434
Ah, oh. Oh, God.

16:33.469 --> 16:35.770
No! Marcy!

16:35.804 --> 16:37.005
- Go, kitty.
- Fuck you.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.840
Come on, kitty cat.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.109
You okay?

16:41.143 --> 16:42.810
Whoo!

16:46.282 --> 16:47.282
You're okay.

16:47.316 --> 16:48.416
Look at me.

16:48.450 --> 16:51.786
Charlie.

16:51.820 --> 16:53.621
I got this.

16:53.656 --> 16:55.456
She is just my kind of psycho.

17:07.202 --> 17:10.238
Hey.

17:10.271 --> 17:12.839
I'm gonna, uh, get a ride
with Ben and Karen.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.943
Traitor.
Don't do that.

17:14.977 --> 17:16.544
That's not how a date ends.

17:16.579 --> 17:20.013
A date ends when the gentleman
drives the lady home.

17:20.049 --> 17:22.016
Mm, yes,
but the gentleman seems

17:22.050 --> 17:23.685
slightly blotto.

17:23.719 --> 17:25.619
Okay, well, you got me there.

17:25.654 --> 17:27.321
Why don't you take the wheel?

17:27.356 --> 17:29.257
The lady takes the wheel
and that way

17:29.291 --> 17:31.526
I am free to fondle
your ladyness.

17:31.560 --> 17:35.063
They are so right,
your friends.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.965
You have such a good heart,

17:36.999 --> 17:39.133
but you're still so messed up.

17:39.168 --> 17:41.836
And you're trapped in the past.

17:41.870 --> 17:43.538
I can't go there with you.

17:43.572 --> 17:45.106
I can't rescue you.

17:45.140 --> 17:47.909
I've tried that
kind of thing before.

17:47.943 --> 17:50.745
It doesn't work.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.513
Good night.

17:52.548 --> 17:53.715
Okay, that's it?

17:53.749 --> 17:54.949
You're just gonna bail?

17:54.984 --> 17:57.085
Captain Fantastic.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.320
You would love that,
wouldn't you?

17:59.355 --> 18:01.089
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm just...

18:01.123 --> 18:06.027
Just home,
'cause the night's over.

18:06.061 --> 18:08.029
You know exactly
where to find me

18:08.063 --> 18:09.931
and that's what scares
the shit out of you.

18:09.965 --> 18:12.000
The fact that I am real.

18:12.034 --> 18:15.570
Not some ghost.

18:15.604 --> 18:17.672
So call me.

18:17.706 --> 18:18.973
Don't call me.

18:19.008 --> 18:21.275
The choice is yours.

18:21.310 --> 18:23.411
If not, uh,

18:23.445 --> 18:26.381
we'll always have Century City,
right, Hank?

18:30.919 --> 18:32.920
Hmm.

18:51.473 --> 18:53.574
Hey, lady lawyer!

19:33.949 --> 19:36.884
Ben, that's you?

19:36.919 --> 19:39.420
I thought it was black Jesus.

19:39.455 --> 19:40.822
I didn't tell you?

19:40.856 --> 19:44.592
That's my alter-ego.

19:44.626 --> 19:47.161
You saved my life.

19:47.196 --> 19:49.731
Like I had a choice.
Shit.

19:49.765 --> 19:51.899
If I let you die,
you'd fucking haunt me

19:51.934 --> 19:53.634
from beyond the grave.

19:53.669 --> 19:56.237
You're clearly the better man.

19:56.271 --> 19:57.805
Yeah, Hank.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.608
Like that was ever up
for a debate, buddy.

20:00.642 --> 20:03.678
Hey, you don't kiss Karen
like that, do you?

20:05.647 --> 20:07.281
It was like absolutely
no tongue.

20:08.717 --> 20:10.485
It was very pleasant, though.

20:10.519 --> 20:11.753
Now don't get me wrong.

20:31.907 --> 20:33.875
Hold on.

20:38.147 --> 20:39.380
Hi, dad.

20:39.414 --> 20:42.683
Hi, beautiful.

20:42.718 --> 20:45.386
Mom said I could run in
and say good-bye.

20:45.420 --> 20:47.188
We're hitting the road.

20:47.222 --> 20:48.823
Well.

20:48.857 --> 20:50.691
Wow.

20:50.726 --> 20:53.361
I don't know how to say good-bye
to you, sweetie.

20:53.395 --> 20:54.929
Are you mad at me?

20:54.963 --> 20:56.531
No, no, no, no.

20:56.565 --> 20:58.432
Never.

20:58.467 --> 21:00.535
Feel like I'm betraying you.

21:00.569 --> 21:01.969
It's not possible.

21:02.004 --> 21:04.071
Have fun out there.

21:04.106 --> 21:05.773
Bring me back a T-shirt
that says,

21:05.808 --> 21:07.942
"My daughter traveled
cross-country with her mother

21:07.976 --> 21:09.544
"and her mother's
new boyfriend and all I got

21:09.578 --> 21:11.712
was this lousy T-shirt."

21:11.747 --> 21:13.314
It's a long T-shirt,
but you could

21:13.348 --> 21:15.216
bring it back for me.

21:15.250 --> 21:16.584
Isn't it better this way?

21:16.618 --> 21:19.120
I mean, I'd rather say good-bye
to you like this

21:19.154 --> 21:20.855
than watch you go off
to prison.

21:20.889 --> 21:23.624
And we'll be back.

21:23.659 --> 21:26.327
Something tells me
it'll never be the same.

21:26.361 --> 21:27.762
Who knows?

21:27.796 --> 21:30.598
Maybe it'll be better.

21:30.632 --> 21:33.768
My sweet little
gloomy optimist.

21:33.802 --> 21:36.971
I love you so much.

21:37.005 --> 21:39.207
I love you too.

21:39.241 --> 21:41.175
Mm.

21:41.210 --> 21:43.477
Mom said you can
go back home if you want.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.079
Well, that's very nice of mom,

21:45.113 --> 21:48.983
but it's not really home without
my girls underfoot.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.418
You know what I mean.

21:50.452 --> 21:52.052
I do.

21:56.191 --> 21:59.293
You know what I think, dad?

21:59.328 --> 22:01.128
I think it's all gonna be okay.

22:01.163 --> 22:03.831
Chapters end.

22:03.866 --> 22:07.134
Sometimes you gotta
shake things up.

22:07.169 --> 22:09.070
Check out of this dump.

22:09.104 --> 22:13.474
Go home.
