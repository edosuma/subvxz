00:03.671 --> 00:06.340
CHRIS ROCK:
Tasha Clarkson was the new
girl next door.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.542
Unlike just about every other
girl in the neighborhood,

00:08.576 --> 00:09.743
she didn't hate me.

00:09.777 --> 00:10.744
Hi, Chris.
Hey, Tasha.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.547
I always tried to play it
cool around her,

00:13.581 --> 00:15.249
but every time she came
out the door,

00:15.283 --> 00:16.517
it looked like this...

00:20.821 --> 00:23.091
But Tasha's grandmother was one
of the strictest parents

00:23.124 --> 00:24.625
on the block.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.561
Where you going
dressed like that?

00:27.595 --> 00:30.098
Grandma, I have on
everything but gloves.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.599
Put some gloves on.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.635
Showing your hands to people.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.770
And it was 79 degrees.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.739
So I figured the smartest
thing to do

00:38.772 --> 00:41.175
was to just leave Tasha alone.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.646
Chris, come quick. I need you.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.715
So much for that plan.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.752
Do you see it?!
Chris, do you see it?!

00:51.785 --> 00:53.787
Oh, yeah, I see it.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.657
But what do you want
me to do with it?

00:59.260 --> 01:01.329
Get it out!

01:01.362 --> 01:03.764
Get it out of my closet!
Okay, okay, okay.
Stop screaming please.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.299
Stop, stop...

01:05.333 --> 01:07.368
She's screaming like
the mouse had a gun.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.416
Thank you.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.418
No problem.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.255
To you, that just looked
like a kiss on the cheek,

01:27.288 --> 01:29.657
but to me it felt
like this...

01:34.495 --> 01:36.664
Yo.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.566
Little dude from
across the street.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.269
Come here.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.671
Listen, man, I don't
have any money.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.206
I don't want your money,
little dude.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.840
I want to know how
you got Tasha.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.609
Got Tasha what?

01:48.642 --> 01:50.878
Come on, little dude.
I saw that.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.714
Every little dude on the block
been trying to get next to her.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.683
Little dude from up
on the third floor,

01:55.716 --> 01:57.518
little dude from
around the corner,

01:57.551 --> 01:59.520
little dude with
the funny leg,

01:59.553 --> 02:01.522
little dude with
the little loft,

02:01.555 --> 02:04.558
little dude that be
with big dude... and Kenny.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.527
Now I know why
they can't get nowhere.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.863
'Cause little dude from across
the street is on the case.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.565
Now why you ain't
tell nobody?

02:11.599 --> 02:12.733
Hey, well, you know.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.702
That's what you said when you
didn't want to lie,

02:14.735 --> 02:15.936
but you didn't want
to tell the truth.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.306
I underestimated
you, little dude.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.773
I ain't think you
had it in you.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.643
Tasha. Mean as her
grandmom is.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.246
You a bad man,
little dude.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.447
Just do me a favor.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.615
Don't tell anybody?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.483
It's between me and you.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.220
:
Little dude from
across the street.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.721
Mackin'.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.290
I should have told him the
truth that nothing happened,

02:36.324 --> 02:37.925
but, hey, well, you know.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.968
* Oh... make it funky now!

CHRIS:
My father never spent money
on himself.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.797
So to get the things he liked,
he used trading stamps.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.767
These weren't the kind of
stamps you put on an envelope.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.802
They were the kind of stamps
you put in books

03:21.835 --> 03:24.705
and could redeem for stuff
that you'd never buy with cash.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.873
Like a bumper pool table...

03:25.906 --> 03:27.875
Oh, yes!

03:27.908 --> 03:31.445
...electro energy ball...

03:31.479 --> 03:32.946
My father wished he could use
trading stamps

03:32.980 --> 03:33.947
to pay for everything.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.383
He needs
a new heart.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.950
Is it in the catalog?

03:36.984 --> 03:38.586
85,000 stamps.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.920
Get that boy
into surgery.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.691
Do they still have that
golden boomerang?

03:43.724 --> 03:45.459
We ain't getting no
golden boomerang.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.894
We getting a new
refrigerator.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.596
What's wrong with
the refrigerator?

03:48.629 --> 03:50.298
The thermostat
is broken.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.266
The freezer's too cold,
the refrigerator's too hot.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.034
It melted the ice cream
and froze the cheese.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.270
I thought we were going
to get something fun.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.871
Eating ain't fun?
Try not eating.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.906
Whatever we get...

03:58.939 --> 04:01.008
A new refrigerator.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.543
...we're gonna have
to do it soon.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.844
The paper said the catalog
store's closing.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.514
We got to redeem all these
by the weekend.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.816
If I have any stamps left,
I'm going to get this.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.284
What?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.052
An electric
ping

04:12.085 --> 04:13.987
It keeps score
automatically.

04:14.021 --> 04:17.257
Now you know you're too big
to be playing ping-pong.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.301
Can we use the sponge instead?

04:27.335 --> 04:29.036
You know how much
a sponge costs?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.804
Less than a new tongue.

04:32.506 --> 04:36.076
Oh, that's one cent
worth of stamp.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.778
Chris, give me the tape.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.548
What my father didn't realize
was that I had to use

04:40.581 --> 04:43.417
two cents worth of tape to
repair one cent worth of stamp.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.886
Hey, Mom, you want to watch
The Ropers with me?

04:47.421 --> 04:47.888
Oh, no, baby, I'm tired.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.958
I've been working all day,

04:50.991 --> 04:52.560
and after I finish
helping Tonya

04:52.593 --> 04:54.428
I got to go
fold clothes.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.529
Oh, okay.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.897
I'll watch it with you.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.198
No, thanks.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.501
The only thing Drew liked more
than watching The Ropers

05:00.534 --> 05:04.004
was watching The Ropers
with my mother.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.574
I hadn't said that anything
really happened

05:06.607 --> 05:07.908
between me and Tasha,

05:07.941 --> 05:09.943
but not saying anything
was almost worse.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.614
Hey, Chris.
Hey, Tasha.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.915
Hey, Tasha,
how you doing?

05:15.849 --> 05:16.950
Man, you better
leave her alone.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.051
Isn't that right,
little dude?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.853
Hey, well, you know.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.955
I know.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.792
I wasn't saying a word
about me and Tasha,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.794
and yet, it was all over
Bed-Stuy.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.996
Girl, little Tasha
who just moved in?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.498
That's right.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.732
You know what else
I heard?

05:31.765 --> 05:33.367
I heard she and Chris
were right outside

05:33.401 --> 05:34.635
on the street kissing.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.869
Ooh, girl, was it
tongue kissing?

05:35.903 --> 05:37.004
Right down
to the throat.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.706
Ooh, I didn't know
she was like that.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.840
You wasn't supposed to know.
Hmm.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.710
Not only Chris have Tasha,
but he got three other women.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.944
Hey, ain't nothing
wrong with that.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.547
The Good Book says
"Be fruitful and prosper."

05:46.580 --> 05:47.548
Yes, Lord.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.849
Got any ashes
in this?

05:48.882 --> 05:50.050
No.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.986
Man, I heard Tasha caught
Chris cheating

05:53.020 --> 05:54.622
with Valerie Simpson.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.924
Nick Ashford
gonna kill him.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.159
Hiyeh...

05:59.192 --> 06:01.529
Notice how Nick Ashford
and Verdine White

06:01.562 --> 06:02.630
look just alike?

06:02.663 --> 06:04.932
Verdine White from
the liquor store,

06:04.965 --> 06:07.034
or Verdine White from
Earth, Wind and Fire?

06:07.067 --> 06:10.170
It's the same guy.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.005
What?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.206
The story was taking off,

06:13.240 --> 06:16.109
and for the first time
I was trying to play it down.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.478
You kissed Tasha?

06:17.511 --> 06:19.447
Well, technically,
she kissed me.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.881
And it wasn't
a "kiss" kiss.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.716
She just kissed me
on the cheek.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.485
Which cheek?
This one.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.753
When did all
this happen?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.621
Yesterday.
She was scared
of a mouse

06:27.655 --> 06:29.957
and I went in
to go get it for her.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.224
Then she gave me
a quick peck.

06:31.258 --> 06:34.562
I was saying that, but I knew
Greg was thinking this...

06:38.231 --> 06:40.100
Wow, you are in there.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.069
Hey, well, you know.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.837
No, I really
don't know.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.673
Greg didn't even have
a vicarious thrill

06:45.706 --> 06:47.074
till he was 22.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.176
Just do me a favor--
don't tell anybody.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.711
Who would I tell?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.946
He would tell everybody.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.748
Hey, Chris.
Hey, Chris.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.450
And I mean everybody.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.085
BOTH:
Hi, Chris.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.721
Even Caruso gave me
some respect.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.557
Hey, Lakeside, I didn't
know you had it in you.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.527
Well, aren't you just
a little Sweet Sweetback.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.061
Hey, well, you know.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.097
Who knew that the secret
for a guy getting girls

07:10.130 --> 07:11.965
is for a guy to get a girl?

07:15.035 --> 07:17.805
While I was getting more
attention than I could handle,

07:17.838 --> 07:19.239
Drew wasn't getting
any at all.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.475
Hey, Mom, could you help
me with my homework?

07:21.509 --> 07:22.876
Oh, baby, I'm tired.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.712
I got to sort clothes
and do laundry.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.781
Can't Chris help you
when he gets home?

07:27.815 --> 07:29.750
I guess.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.453
Drew hadn't looked that sad
since E.T. went home.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.824
What?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.225
Okay, what?

07:38.258 --> 07:40.961
I'm just trying
to figure you out.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.129
Here I'm thinking,

07:42.162 --> 07:43.964
your middle name
is "Mr. Lonely."

07:43.997 --> 07:46.800
Come to find out
it's "Lady

07:46.834 --> 07:47.901
I'm not a lady-killer.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.603
Yeah, I wasn't either.
That's how come

07:49.637 --> 07:51.271
I got divorced
as many times as I did.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.607
Look, when
your time comes,

07:53.641 --> 07:55.709
get you a pre-nup.

07:55.743 --> 07:56.977
I don't have anything.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.078
Well, they'll
take that, too.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.713
You got that right.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.715
Hi, Chris.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.216
How you doing?

08:03.250 --> 08:04.985
Who are you?

08:05.018 --> 08:07.187
Diedre, but you can
call me Dee-Dee.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.856
This is Shavonda.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.025
What's this?

08:12.059 --> 08:13.260
My phone number.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.962
So I can call you?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.063
Yeah.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.230
You know, I heard about

08:17.264 --> 08:18.632
you and Tasha.

08:18.666 --> 08:19.933
Hey, well, you know.

08:21.802 --> 08:22.870
Hey, well, you know what?

08:22.903 --> 08:24.838
Hi, Tasha.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.006
Don't "Hi, Tasha" me.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.542
Hey, well, you know what?

08:28.576 --> 08:30.143
What were you gonna
say about me, Chris?

08:30.177 --> 08:33.747
You have something to say,
say it to my face.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.216
I want my mama!

08:38.185 --> 08:40.721
The only person who hadn't
heard about me and Tasha

08:40.754 --> 08:41.922
was my mother.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.223
But that was about to change.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.125
Hello, Louise.
How you doing?

08:45.158 --> 08:47.027
You keep

08:47.060 --> 08:49.162
your nasty little
nappy-headed son

08:49.196 --> 08:51.832
away from my granddaughter.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.166
That's how I'm doing.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.135
That look means all seven
of the words

08:55.168 --> 08:56.403
you can't say on television.

08:56.436 --> 09:00.240
Because this is a family show,
all she can say is this...

09:00.273 --> 09:01.642
Excuse me?

09:01.675 --> 09:04.244
Let me slow
it down for you.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.313
Keep...

09:06.346 --> 09:10.651
your nasty little
nappy-headed son...

09:10.684 --> 09:13.186
away... from my granddaughter.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.023
Okay, Louise, first of all,

09:16.056 --> 09:18.826
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.194
Second of all, I suggest
you watch your tone.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.998
I suggest you watch your son.

09:25.032 --> 09:30.671
Louise, I'm going to assume that
you have not lost your mind.

09:30.704 --> 09:31.972
All right.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.141
There's less anger
in the Middle East.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.945
So exactly what is it
that you're talking about?

09:37.978 --> 09:41.949
Your son was in my house

09:41.982 --> 09:44.251
with my granddaughter

09:44.284 --> 09:46.353
when I wasn't home.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.222
And then went around
the neighborhood

09:49.256 --> 09:52.993
and talked about her like
she was some kind of tramp.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.227
Chris?

09:54.261 --> 09:56.864
No, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.299
Yes, Chris.

09:59.332 --> 10:03.370
I don't know how he wormed
himself into my house,

10:03.403 --> 10:05.205
but I'll tell you this--

10:05.238 --> 10:07.641
if it happens again,

10:07.675 --> 10:11.679
there's going to be a problem.

10:11.712 --> 10:15.215
"Problem" is a polite word
for "ass-kicking."

10:18.952 --> 10:20.287
ROCHELLE:
Chris!

10:20.320 --> 10:21.855
CHRIS:
Uh-oh.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.793
Why is Miss Clarkson
talking about...?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.394
Boy, turn around
before I smack a face

10:27.427 --> 10:29.362
onto the back of your head.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.264
Why is

10:31.298 --> 10:32.700
Miss Clarkson talking
about you

10:32.733 --> 10:34.768
in her house with Tasha,
and it's all

10:34.802 --> 10:36.269
over the neighborhood?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.171
I do not appreciate
the whole neighborhood

10:38.205 --> 10:39.707
knowing something
about my child,

10:39.740 --> 10:41.341
and I'm the last to find out.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.678
My mother hated being the last
to find out about anything.

10:46.379 --> 10:50.718
ALL:
Surprise!

10:50.751 --> 10:53.353
Why am I the last to know?

10:53.386 --> 10:55.723
Congratulations.
You're pregnant.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.157
That's great!

10:57.190 --> 11:00.961
Pregnant?! Why am
I the last to know?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.029
What's going on?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.263
That's what
I'm trying to find out.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.766
Miss Clarkson said that Chris
was in her house with Tasha.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.367
Doing what?
CHRIS:
Nothing.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.002
She asked me to come over
because there

11:09.036 --> 11:11.304
was a mouse in her closet.
I got rid of it,

11:11.338 --> 11:14.041
and then we went
right back outside.
Getting rid of a mouse?

11:14.074 --> 11:15.275
Is that what
they're calling it nowadays?

11:15.308 --> 11:17.310
Are you an exterminator?
If you are,

11:17.344 --> 11:18.311
let me see your paycheck.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.379
No.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.914
Chris, I don't care

11:20.948 --> 11:22.449
if you were
over somebody's house

11:22.482 --> 11:25.886
getting rid of a mouse,
a spider, a roach, a tiger...

11:25.919 --> 11:27.354
I was just trying to help.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.856
Chris, please tell me.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.123
Is that all
that really happened?

11:30.157 --> 11:32.826
'Cause Miss Clarkson seems to
think that you were doing more

11:32.860 --> 11:34.361
than just getting rid
of a mouse, boy.

11:34.394 --> 11:39.499
Well, after we went outside,
she gave me a kiss on the cheek,

11:39.532 --> 11:41.334
and Jerome saw and,
next thing I know,

11:41.368 --> 11:42.369
it's all over the neighborhood.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.905
And you had nothing
to do with spreading that?

11:44.938 --> 11:48.475
Hey, well, you know.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.210
"Hey, well, you know"?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.912
Well, what is that
supposed to mean?

11:53.947 --> 11:57.184
Rochelle,
Chris and I need to talk

11:57.217 --> 11:59.452
for a minute.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.955
You putting me out?

12:01.989 --> 12:03.456
We need to have
a man-to-man talk.

12:03.490 --> 12:06.393
Okay, fine.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.494
Julius, the next
time somebody comes

12:07.527 --> 12:09.062
to this house with a problem,

12:09.096 --> 12:11.331
I'm gonna send them directly
to you. Is that okay?

12:11.364 --> 12:12.399
Huh?

12:12.432 --> 12:14.301
All right.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.779
Sit down.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.984
Chris, if you're leading
people to believe

12:31.018 --> 12:32.953
you did something
with that girl you didn't do,

12:32.986 --> 12:34.354
then you need to fix it.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.989
But I never said
we did anything.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.458
Let me tell you
how to treat women, son.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.960
If you do something,

12:39.993 --> 12:42.195
you should never say anything.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.497
If you don't do something,
and you don't say anything,

12:44.531 --> 12:45.999
that means you did something

12:46.033 --> 12:48.035
even if you
did nothing.

12:48.068 --> 12:51.438
So, by not saying anything,
you're doing something,

12:51.471 --> 12:54.441
and you need to say something
and let people know

12:54.474 --> 12:56.409
you did nothing.
You understand?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.078
No.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.546
Yeah.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.448
All right.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.283
Hey, Tasha, wait up!

13:05.118 --> 13:07.921
What?
I just wanted
to tell you
that I was sorry.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.890
Why would you say
all those things about me?

13:09.923 --> 13:12.559
I just moved in and,
all of a sudden,
I have a reputation.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.261
I didn't say
anything, for real.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.164
Well, somebody
said something,
and it wasn't me.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.938
Yo, little dude.
Your old lady
mad at you, huh?

13:24.972 --> 13:27.540
She's not my old lady.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.509
What

13:29.542 --> 13:31.544
Yeah, well...

13:31.578 --> 13:34.247
I know. I know.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.451
Hey, Mom, can you help me
make some Kool

13:38.485 --> 13:40.487
Aw, Drew, I'm trying
to rest for 20 minutes

13:40.520 --> 13:42.589
before I have
to cook dinner.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.926
Here. You know how
to make Kool-Aid.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.396
Never mind. Forget it.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.967
What's wrong with him?

13:54.001 --> 13:57.037
I don't know,
but I'm about
to find out.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.906
We got any Kool

13:58.939 --> 14:07.915
Mm-hmm.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.150
My mother had to find out
what was up

14:10.183 --> 14:12.352
before she had
to smack Drew down.

14:25.232 --> 14:28.268
Something you
want to talk about?

14:30.270 --> 14:31.471
Why do you
pay more attention

14:31.504 --> 14:33.373
to Chris and Tonya
than you do me?

14:33.406 --> 14:38.078
I don't do it
on purpose, baby.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.580
Well, then, how come
every time I ask you
to do something,

14:40.613 --> 14:42.615
you always make me
do it by myself?

14:42.649 --> 14:44.617
* The closer I get to you...

14:44.651 --> 14:47.254
Well, because you've
always been able

14:47.287 --> 14:48.922
to do things on your own.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.058
Doesn't mean
I love you any less.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.927
Sometimes
it feels like it.

14:53.961 --> 14:56.396
Oh, don't say that, Drew.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.564
I'm proud of you.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.667
* By giving me
all you've got... *

15:00.700 --> 15:04.004
I guess I don't see you
as being my baby anymore.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.605
You don't?

15:05.638 --> 15:07.540
Uh-uh.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.945
I look at you as a young man,
because you're so independent.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.114
I'm independent?

15:14.147 --> 15:15.582
Yeah.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.484
And you're funny.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.651
You're handsome.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.920
Oh, cool.

15:22.689 --> 15:25.058
So you going to be okay?

15:25.092 --> 15:27.961
Yeah.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.263
I'm sorry, Drew.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.065
I love you.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.666
I love you, too.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.203
Good. Come on, let's
make some Kool-Aid.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.505
Oh, and another thing.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.673
If you ever walk away
from me like that again,

15:40.707 --> 15:45.045
you going to need a wheelchair
to bring you back. Okay?

15:45.078 --> 15:48.581
Meanwhile, I had girl trouble
without having a girl.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.717
Hey, Tasha. Can I talk
to you for a second?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.152
No.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.520
Hey, why you acting
all stuck

15:53.553 --> 15:54.687
I know Chris is cool
and everything,

15:54.721 --> 15:55.688
but you're too good for me?

15:55.722 --> 15:57.724
CHRIS:
Tasha!

16:01.394 --> 16:03.563
I want everyone
to listen to me!

16:03.596 --> 16:05.232
Tasha is

16:05.265 --> 16:07.434
not my girlfriend.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.601
She never was.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.737
I know everybody
thinks that something

16:10.770 --> 16:13.673
was going on between us,
but nothing happened.

16:13.706 --> 16:18.645
And not nothing something.
Nothing nothing.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.614
Tasha's a nice girl.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.416
She's not like that.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.252
I got rid of a mouse for her.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.721
Then she gave me a kiss on
the cheek and a hug. That's it.

16:28.755 --> 16:33.126
Tasha, I'm sorry.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.528
Now, would you all

16:35.562 --> 16:38.331
quit talking about this?

16:38.365 --> 16:41.168
Because there is nothing
to talk about.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.503
I wish there was
something to talk about.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.338
But there's not.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.706
Okay?

16:46.739 --> 16:51.744
* Girl, don't take
your love from me... *

16:51.778 --> 16:54.647
Get off of my car, fool!

16:54.681 --> 16:57.484
How did he know my nickname?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.619
I can't believe you
made the whole thing up.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.221
I didn't make
anything up.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.423
Everyone else did.
What do you expect
people to think

17:03.456 --> 17:04.524
with you running
around saying,

17:04.557 --> 17:06.759
"Yeah, well, you know"
to everything?

17:06.793 --> 17:08.728
That's why
I had to stop it.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.630
I thought you
were so in there.

17:10.663 --> 17:11.964
Everybody did.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.701
Listen, just don't say anything
to anybody. I want this to die.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.769
I won't say a word.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.472
This is going to stay
between you and me.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.640
All right.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.175
Just like before.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.176
Hey.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.544
BOTH:
Ew!

17:26.713 --> 17:28.281
How you guys doing?

17:28.315 --> 17:29.682
Shut up!
Shut up!

17:31.451 --> 17:34.454
You blew it,
cornbread.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.789
Some Sweetback
you are.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.593
I wasn't the only one
looking for redemption.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.295
Back at the catalog store,

17:42.329 --> 17:44.264
my father was taking
his sweet stamps back.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.832
I'm here to
redeem my stamps.

17:45.865 --> 17:46.866
What would you like?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.868
The olive green refrigerator.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.437
We're out of those.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.304
You have one in yellow?

17:51.338 --> 17:53.573
No. We're out
of the refrigerators.

17:53.606 --> 17:54.807
Well, what
about the stove?

17:54.841 --> 17:55.775
Gone.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.644
The sofa?
Uh-uh.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.679
Washing machine?
Nope.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.714
Electric ping
Nada.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.782
Mini
Zilch.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.184
The golden boomerang?
The bishop

18:04.217 --> 18:05.818
just walked out
with the last one.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.187
Hello.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.356
So what do you have?

18:09.389 --> 18:13.593
Well, we got this.

18:13.626 --> 18:17.096
Oh, cool. Nice.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.799
This is a nice canoe.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.535
100,000 more stamps
and we could get a river.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.209
Julius, where you plan
on putting this canoe?

18:29.242 --> 18:32.379
I don't know. Somewhere.

18:39.886 --> 18:40.853
Where's the canoe?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.555
How did they untie it?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.891
When did they take it?

18:44.924 --> 18:47.794
They wouldn't have
taken a refrigerator.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.862
The next week, that's exactly

18:49.896 --> 18:51.898
how they stole
our new refrigerator.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.767
That's 4,652 books
worth of stamps!

18:54.801 --> 18:56.303
The word back on the block

18:56.336 --> 18:58.738
was that Tasha and I
had never done a thing,

18:58.771 --> 19:00.373
but sometimes you have
to hear things

19:00.407 --> 19:01.508
from the horse's mouth.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.509
Miss Clarkson?

19:02.542 --> 19:06.279
What do you want
with your little mannish behind?

19:06.313 --> 19:08.348
I wanted to apologize.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.518
What exactly is it
that you're apologizing for?

19:11.551 --> 19:13.820
Well, first, to Tasha
for letting all those people

19:13.853 --> 19:15.087
believe all that stuff
about her.

19:15.121 --> 19:19.326
And to you for going into your
house without your permission.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.461
Did your mother
send you over here to do that?

19:21.494 --> 19:22.462
Because, if she did...

19:22.495 --> 19:23.730
She didn't.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.234
You're not fooling anybody.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.868
I know you.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.537
I don't know what you do

19:30.570 --> 19:31.871
with these little fast girls
around here,

19:31.904 --> 19:33.840
but you're not going
to do that with Tasha.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.245
Miss Clarkson missed me
when Tasha started

19:38.278 --> 19:40.280
dating Bobby Brown.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.718
Chris?

19:47.654 --> 19:49.322
Thank you.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.230
Hey! Little dude
from across the street.

19:57.264 --> 20:00.267
Man, that's too bad
what happened with
you and Tasha.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.269
I told you,
nothing happened
with me and Tasha.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.771
Yeah, I know.
Let me hold a dollar.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.906
They say the truth
will set you free,

20:06.939 --> 20:08.775
but in my case
it cost a dollar.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.877
At least I still had
Dee Dee's phone number.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.412
Give me back
my phone number!

20:12.445 --> 20:14.514
You better not
have it memorized.

20:19.919 --> 20:23.256
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:23.290 --> 20:26.459
