     Oh, sensational.           

01:01.962 --> 01:03.895
            Oh, gee, you do that
              with such flair.  

01:03.897 --> 01:06.497
Well, either you have it or you 
 don't, you know what I mean?   

01:06.499 --> 01:07.899
                 Can I help you?
         Yeah.                  

01:07.901 --> 01:10.434
See if you can find             
my thumb in there.              

01:10.436 --> 01:12.503
          Hey, what's that thing
            you're cooking in?  

01:12.505 --> 01:13.972
    Oh, that's, uh--            
     That's a wok.              

01:13.974 --> 01:15.173
                      A what?   

01:15.175 --> 01:16.607
No, no, no, a wok.              

01:16.609 --> 01:18.777
It's Frank Lorenzo's.           
He's teaching me how to use it. 

01:18.779 --> 01:19.878
You cook                        
Chinese food in it.             

01:21.080 --> 01:22.080
                    Ooh!        

01:22.082 --> 01:23.314
You know, I'm starting          
to understand                   

01:23.316 --> 01:25.850
why Frank Lorenzo gets          
such a big kick out of cooking. 

01:25.852 --> 01:28.053
            Gee, you're really  
         having fun, aren't you?

01:28.055 --> 01:29.253
                  Yeah!         

01:29.255 --> 01:30.855
            You know, I oughta  
         cook dinner more often.

01:30.857 --> 01:34.559
    Oh, I wouldn't rush into    
 a decision like that, Michael. 

01:34.561 --> 01:35.827
                          EDITH:
                            Hi. 

01:35.829 --> 01:37.896
                How's it coming?
Oh, terrific, Ma.               

01:37.898 --> 01:39.363
                    Oh, good.   

01:39.365 --> 01:43.401
  Oh, Mike, I don't like to give
    advice when I ain't asked.  

01:43.403 --> 01:45.536
                Can I give you  
              a piece of advice?

01:45.538 --> 01:46.938
  Oh, yeah, sure, Ma.           

01:46.940 --> 01:50.541
    You're supposed to cook     
     in the pot, not in the lid.

01:52.111 --> 01:55.080
No, Ma, that's not              
a lid, it's a wok.              

01:55.082 --> 01:58.183
The Chinese cook in it,         
like we use a frying pan.       

01:58.185 --> 01:59.784
                         Oh, my!

01:59.786 --> 02:04.455
        I bet they have a lot   
     of trouble making pancakes.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.390
Don't you think                 
Michael's brave, though,        

02:06.392 --> 02:08.592
cooking dinner                  
all by himself?                 

02:08.595 --> 02:09.961
Well, well, well, not so brave. 

02:09.963 --> 02:12.230
  I mean, after all, remember   
    the old Chinese proverb,    

02:12.232 --> 02:16.300
        "Many men cook,         
    but <i>fu mein chu."</i>           

02:18.904 --> 02:22.807
I ain't never heard that before.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.243
         And let's hope         
    you never hear it again.    

02:25.245 --> 02:27.378
Come on, Ma,                    
let's set the table.            

02:27.380 --> 02:31.282
        Oh, Mike, are you sure  
     you can manage by yourself?

02:31.284 --> 02:32.483
Oh, sure, Ma.                   
There's no problem.             

02:32.485 --> 02:33.517
As long as I remember           

02:33.519 --> 02:35.120
the four basic rules            
that Frank taught me:           

02:35.122 --> 02:36.788
block, wok, hot, lot.           

02:36.790 --> 02:39.190
        Block, wok, hot, lot?   

02:39.192 --> 02:41.092
                Is that Chinese?
No, no, no, Ma.                 

02:41.094 --> 02:43.094
It means chop on block,         
cook in wok,                    

02:43.096 --> 02:44.863
serve it hot,                   
then pray a lot.                

02:46.866 --> 02:50.068
              Well, just yell   
        if you need anything.   

02:50.070 --> 02:51.970
Okay, Ma, I will.

     [WHISTLING TUNEFULLY]      

03:05.550 --> 03:07.085
                  Don't worry   
            about dinner, Ma.   

03:07.087 --> 03:10.321
                  It'll be fine.
Oh, I ain't worried, Gloria.    

03:10.323 --> 03:13.624
I just feel guilty              
doing nothing                   

03:13.626 --> 03:16.294
while a man                     
is cooking my dinner.           

03:16.296 --> 03:20.665
  I guess I just ain't used to  
    a life of luxury.           

03:21.801 --> 03:23.567
 But Michael's enjoying it, Ma. 

03:23.569 --> 03:26.171
  It's not as if he was forced  
    to do dinner every night    

03:26.173 --> 03:27.438
        the way you are.        

03:27.440 --> 03:31.109
    Oh, I ain't forced          
    to do it either, Gloria.    

03:31.111 --> 03:33.812
I do it because I want to.      

03:33.814 --> 03:38.416

             awful late tonight.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.155
Oh, he don't mind               
being late                      

03:44.157 --> 03:47.425
when he's driving               
Mr. Munson's cab.               

03:47.427 --> 03:50.628
    It means he's doing good    
     and making more money.

        Oh, 6:30, I bet

          held you up           
     and stole your wallet.     

04:09.582 --> 04:11.115
  I told you that three times.  

04:11.117 --> 04:12.884

      some action on this?

your statement down here.

  talk to you about it later.

all the Irish cops on the force?

      Oh, let me tell you,      

04:27.868 --> 04:30.468
them were the guys that knew how
to handle crime on the streets. 

04:30.470 --> 04:31.936
They was always out there       
         busting heads.

    Best types of all.          

04:38.178 --> 04:39.443
They didn't waste no time       

04:39.445 --> 04:41.779
     bringing the crinimals     
    into court to be let go.    

04:41.781 --> 04:44.949
They grab a guy, they tell him, 
 "Hey, don't do that no more!"  

04:44.951 --> 04:48.253
Then they crack him on the skull
     so he wouldn't forget.

      Oh.                       

06:56.549 --> 06:57.815
Roselli.                        

06:57.817 --> 07:00.184
Ain't you got                   
no barbers in the family?       

07:03.355 --> 07:07.158
Look, I wear my hair long       
  because I like it that way.   

07:07.160 --> 07:08.792
                    Does it     
                     bother you?

07:08.794 --> 07:12.497
No, no. I was just staring      
    at it, that's all.          

07:12.499 --> 07:15.533
         Let's talk about       
  your crook's hair, Mr. Bunker.

07:15.535 --> 07:18.403
     Now, you say there in your 
    statement that it was blond.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.603
  How blond?                    

07:19.605 --> 07:21.906
          Oh, he was very blond,
            very bright.        

07:21.908 --> 07:23.174
            He was almost white.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.910
  In fact, if you was to give   
      this guy a nickname,      

07:25.912 --> 07:29.080
it'd probably be, er, "Whitey." 

07:29.082 --> 07:31.916
Did he brush his hair           
straight back?                  

07:31.918 --> 07:33.217
             Yeah, he brushed it
                  straight--    

07:33.219 --> 07:34.452
            How'd you know that?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.354
        I'm a detective.        

07:36.356 --> 07:38.256
Mr. Bunker,                     
I think I know this guy,        

07:38.258 --> 07:40.258
and there's a good chance       
that I'm gonna catch him.       

07:40.260 --> 07:41.592
             Yeah, well, listen.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.695
    Before I go there, I just   
      wanna remind you once more

07:44.697 --> 07:46.764
    about the amount of money   
          in the wallet there.  

07:46.766 --> 07:51.069
        It was exactly 50 bucks,
         you know? On the nose. 

07:51.071 --> 07:52.670
Yeah, I know.                   
It's in your statement.         

07:52.672 --> 07:54.072
            Yeah, I know it's   
                in my statement,

07:54.074 --> 07:55.273
          but I hear tell       
        that sometimes          

07:55.275 --> 07:57.775
when money changes hands        
in police stations,             

07:57.777 --> 07:58.642
that it, uh...                  

08:00.212 --> 08:01.412
                 That it what?  

08:01.414 --> 08:04.215
That it gets lost.              

08:04.217 --> 08:07.085
         Don't worry about that.
             You're in luck.    

08:07.087 --> 08:08.486
            See, it's the end   
                 of the month.  

08:08.488 --> 08:10.455
                I'm already over
                 my graft quota.

08:12.691 --> 08:15.859
You see, if I stole any more,   
    I'd be in a higher bracket. 

08:18.063 --> 08:19.564
Come on,                        
are you telling--?              

08:19.566 --> 08:21.765
            Mr. Bunker, go home.

08:22.901 --> 08:24.635
All right.                      

08:26.405 --> 08:29.974
Oh, Archie,                     
I'm so glad you ain't hurt!     

08:29.976 --> 08:33.943
And I feel terrible             
because I wasn't even worried.  

08:33.946 --> 08:35.580
I thought you was doing good.   
                      All right.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.082
And all the time                
you was being robbed.           

08:38.083 --> 08:39.883
            Oh, but I'm fine.   
He could have killed you!       

08:39.885 --> 08:42.486
                     Look at me.
                    Am I killed?

08:42.489 --> 08:43.654
                What are you    
                  talking about?

08:43.655 --> 08:45.689
                    These punk  
                  stick-up guys,

08:45.691 --> 08:49.160
     they never kill a guy that 
    knows how to handle himself.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.495
How do you                      
handle yourself?                

08:50.497 --> 08:52.997
    Give him the money          
      before he kills you.      

08:55.000 --> 08:56.900
                 Daddy, how much
                did he get?     

08:56.902 --> 08:59.537
    How much did he get?        
  He got my whole wad, 50 bucks.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.239
            Oh, that's terrible!

09:01.241 --> 09:04.008
                Did he actually 
              pull a gun on you?

09:04.010 --> 09:05.409
            He didn't have to   
                  pull a gun.   

09:05.411 --> 09:07.011
            I could see the lump
            in his pocket.      

09:07.013 --> 09:11.182
Maybe he was doing like         
Edward G. Robinson used to do,  

09:11.184 --> 09:15.386
just holding a pipe in          
his pocket and making believe.  

09:19.625 --> 09:22.493
          Jeez, I wish I'd have 
         thought of that, Edith.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.094
                I'd have said   
             to the hold-up guy,

09:24.096 --> 09:26.564
        "Hey, you only got      
        Edgar G. Robinson's pipe

09:26.566 --> 09:28.566
                in your pocket."

09:28.568 --> 09:31.602
             Then he would have 
        killed me right then.   

09:33.138 --> 09:34.572
                 Daddy, what did
                 the police say?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.040
                Said nothing.   

09:36.042 --> 09:39.943
The guy I was talking to was    
 too busy combing his long hair.

09:39.945 --> 09:41.345
Sounds like Serpico.            

09:41.347 --> 09:42.880
          Serpico.              

09:42.882 --> 09:45.650
Ain't that a cough syrup?       

09:46.818 --> 09:48.018
No, Ma. Serpico is a detective. 

09:48.020 --> 09:49.520
He's one of the new breed.      

09:49.522 --> 09:51.689
     Yeah, to me he looked      
    like an old breed.          

09:51.691 --> 09:53.291
        Sheepdog.               

09:54.426 --> 09:55.426
    What do you want, Arch?     

09:55.428 --> 09:56.427
  Someone who's nice and neat   

09:56.429 --> 09:57.528
  and clean with shined shoes?  

09:57.530 --> 09:59.297
Why not? The city's paying them.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.599
Someone with a nice, sober suit 
        and short hair?         

10:01.601 --> 10:02.667
ARCHIE:                         
That's right!                   

10:02.669 --> 10:04.569
     Someone like Halderman     
         or Erlichman?          

10:04.571 --> 10:07.137
         That's right--         
         Get off that!          

10:10.642 --> 10:11.875
                  GLORIA: Daddy.

10:11.877 --> 10:14.512
         Daddy, will you be able
          to identify the thief 

10:14.514 --> 10:16.013
              if they catch him?

10:16.015 --> 10:17.582
            Certainly I will,   
                  little girl.  

10:17.584 --> 10:20.050
    I'll remember that young    
punk kid the longest day I live.

10:20.052 --> 10:23.020
Oh, Archie,                     
was he really young?            

10:23.022 --> 10:24.222
             Yeah, he was young.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.257
          And believe it or not,
            he was white.       

10:28.560 --> 10:29.893
 Why shouldn't we believe that? 

10:29.895 --> 10:31.995
    You never pick up           
        any black fares.        

10:31.997 --> 10:33.331
                    Ah, shut up.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.900
Why don't you never pick up     
any black people, Archie?       

10:36.902 --> 10:39.570
             You want me driving
             up there to Harlem?

10:39.572 --> 10:40.838
                  Suppose my cab
                    broke down  

10:40.840 --> 10:42.873
at the corner of 137th Street   
         and Lenox Avenue,      

10:42.875 --> 10:44.074
            what do you think   
                 would happen?  

10:44.076 --> 10:47.311
Maybe somebody would            
repair it for you.              

10:47.313 --> 10:50.348
                        What?   
Well, you're always...          

10:51.483 --> 10:52.516
You're always saying            

10:52.518 --> 10:56.220
that colored people             
are good fixing cars.           

10:56.222 --> 11:00.090
  Ah, that's only when they're  
    in white neighborhoods.     

11:00.092 --> 11:02.660
Archie, you are so full of--    
                        Michael!

11:02.662 --> 11:04.662
                  Hey, hey, hey!
What about your dinner?         

11:04.664 --> 11:08.065
  What was that? What was that? 
 I'm full of what? Full of what?

11:08.067 --> 11:10.067
                    Hey! Hey!   

11:10.069 --> 11:12.069
          The women cut you off,
        but you was gonna say   

11:12.071 --> 11:13.471
            something dirty     
    in the living room there.   

11:13.473 --> 11:14.538
Because you were                
talking stupid.                 

11:14.540 --> 11:16.206
Why do you always               
have to talk stupid?            

11:16.208 --> 11:18.709
         To make you understand!

11:20.646 --> 11:23.147
      Funny.                    

11:23.149 --> 11:24.715
            Let me ask you this,

11:24.717 --> 11:26.384
                how come you're 
            never on my side,   

11:26.386 --> 11:28.185
                even when       
              a guy holds me up?

11:28.187 --> 11:30.655
Archie, if they catch that boy, 

11:30.657 --> 11:34.425
will you have to take off work  
and go to court for his trial?  

11:34.427 --> 11:36.126
            Certainly I will.   
                  Sure I will.  

11:36.128 --> 11:38.028
          I'll lose a day's pay,
             but it's worth it  

11:38.030 --> 11:40.898
      to see that piece of filth
         thrown into the jug.   

11:40.900 --> 11:42.099
  Hey, hey, wait a second, Arch.

11:42.101 --> 11:43.501
      You're talking about      
         a human being.         

11:43.503 --> 11:44.868
          I'm talking about     
            a creep.            

11:44.870 --> 11:45.969
             All right, I agree.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.871
        He should be punished   
              for what he did,  

11:47.873 --> 11:50.308
 but you don't go around calling
    people "pieces of filth."   

11:50.310 --> 11:52.443
How about "piece of creep"?     

11:53.645 --> 11:55.245
            There you go,       
        talking stupid again.   

11:55.247 --> 11:58.382
There you go,                   
understanding me again.         

12:00.218 --> 12:03.921
What the hell are you slopping  
around with here in the pot?    

12:03.923 --> 12:05.623
              It's Chinese food.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.024
It don't look                   
like Chinks to me.              

12:07.026 --> 12:09.126
              GLORIA & MIKE:    
            Chinese food!       

12:09.128 --> 12:10.227
That's what I said,             
Chinks,                         

12:10.229 --> 12:11.696
and that ain't it.              

12:11.698 --> 12:14.565
  Yes, it is, Daddy, and it's   
  very good. Michael made it.   

12:14.567 --> 12:16.767
Michael m--                     

12:16.769 --> 12:19.102
    Are you letting the Meathead
        cook my supper?         

12:19.104 --> 12:22.540
Oh, yeah! Frank Lorenzo         
taught him how to do it.        

12:22.542 --> 12:24.442
              Then let him      
    and Frank Lorenzo eat it.   

12:24.444 --> 12:27.678
Oh, Archie, it looks so good    
and it smells--                 

12:27.680 --> 12:30.648
                    It smells   
                like fertilizer.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.116
            And that's what     
      you're full of! That's it!

12:33.118 --> 12:35.820
All right, you don't have to eat
it. He's not eating the food!   

12:35.822 --> 12:37.755
    Daddy, you could            
    at least try it.            

12:37.757 --> 12:39.357
    What would you say          
      if you cooked dinner      

12:39.359 --> 12:40.758

18:16.862 --> 18:18.062
                      I knew it.
                      I knew it.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.997
            Tom Farrell paid you
            to keep quiet.      

18:19.999 --> 18:21.198
  What's the matter with that?  

18:21.200 --> 18:23.366
      Ain't you ever heard      
    "silence is gold"?          

18:25.536 --> 18:28.505
Archie, I don't think           
you should have taken that.     

18:28.507 --> 18:29.973
            Why not?            

18:29.975 --> 18:32.876
Because you're breaking the law,
  Arch. You accepted a bribe.   

18:32.878 --> 18:34.377
I didn't accept no bribe!       

18:34.379 --> 18:37.848
 Well, what's your word for it, 
    "campaign contribution"?    

18:37.850 --> 18:40.718
        Don't be stupid.        
  I ain't running for nothing.  

18:40.720 --> 18:42.820
I was just doing something      
    to help a guy out.          

18:42.822 --> 18:45.089
    To help a guy out?          

18:45.091 --> 18:47.224
                ARCHIE:         
      That's right, little girl.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.726
        That's the American way.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.128
      If a guy's down, you don't
      kick him, you help him up.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.331
Then you scratch his back       
    and he scratches yours.     

18:54.333 --> 18:57.067
      This is the scratch       
          I just got.           

19:02.640 --> 19:06.476
Oh, don't be looking at me      
     like a wounded sheep.      

19:06.478 --> 19:09.079
 I gotta go down to the police  
 station to pick up the wallet. 

19:09.081 --> 19:11.381
    Now, before I go,           
      could I have a beer?      

19:11.383 --> 19:12.716
All right, Archie.              

19:12.718 --> 19:17.921
Daddy, what if the police find  
out that Mr. Farrell paid you?  

19:17.923 --> 19:19.556
Oh, I ain't splitting with them.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.291
          Let the cops          
      make their own deal.      

19:24.195 --> 19:28.065
Your wallet will be brought down
    in a minute, Mr. Bunker.    

19:28.067 --> 19:29.166
    Well, jeez, it's about time,

19:29.168 --> 19:31.168
            not that I wanna    
    put the rush on you guys.   

19:31.170 --> 19:32.502
      My cab's parked out there.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.604
    It don't make me no money   
          sitting at the curb.  

19:34.606 --> 19:35.773
Wait over there,                
will you?                       

19:35.775 --> 19:37.040
                Yeah, all right,
                all right.      

19:37.042 --> 19:40.443
          Jeez, it's gonna take 
          all night, this thing.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.913
[SIGHS]                         

19:42.915 --> 19:45.515
Oh, hi there. You must be       
working with Roselli, huh?      

19:45.517 --> 19:46.516
             What?              

19:46.518 --> 19:47.684
Yeah, what have                 
you got,                        

19:47.686 --> 19:49.719
another one of them             
grand larceny bums over there?  

19:49.721 --> 19:50.720
             What?              

19:50.722 --> 19:51.922
Listen, I wanna                 
tell you something.             

19:51.924 --> 19:53.723
I got a lot of respect          
for you guys,                   

19:53.725 --> 19:54.925
going around                    
the way youse do                

19:54.927 --> 19:56.726
with the long hair              
and them clothes like that,     

19:56.728 --> 19:58.295
smelling like                   
the river.                      

20:01.099 --> 20:03.901
All I wanna say is you're doing 
a great job for the city there  

20:03.903 --> 20:05.468
and I appreciate it.            

20:05.470 --> 20:07.404
    Hey, Pete, you can          
    bring him up now.           

20:07.406 --> 20:10.941
             Okay. On your feet.
                Come on.        

20:10.943 --> 20:13.510
Uh, wait a minute!              
What's going on?                

20:13.512 --> 20:14.611
What, are you                   
the detective?                  

20:14.613 --> 20:15.612
                That's right.   

20:15.614 --> 20:17.314
I thought you was               
the undercover man.             

20:17.316 --> 20:21.151
            :What are you,      
     some kind of a mental case?

20:29.194 --> 20:30.527
Oh, hello, Bunker.              

20:30.529 --> 20:32.095
                    Oh, hiya,   
                 Roselli, there.

20:32.097 --> 20:34.097
            Hey, why did you    
        hang up on me like that?

20:34.099 --> 20:36.333
Oh, well, because we had        
a visitor in the house,         

20:36.335 --> 20:37.767
and there was                   
a lot going on.                 

20:37.769 --> 20:40.170
Look, Roselli, I just come down 
to get my wallet, that's all.   

20:40.172 --> 20:41.471
                Yeah, I know.   

20:41.473 --> 20:43.740
How come you dropped the charges
      against Andy Farrell?     

20:43.742 --> 20:45.608
Well, I mean, after all,        

20:45.610 --> 20:47.410
I don't wanna get               
an innocent kid in Dutch.       

20:47.412 --> 20:48.846
You know, I mean--              

20:48.848 --> 20:50.047
Well, you don't go around       

20:50.049 --> 20:52.015
throwing human beings           
into the jug.                   

20:52.017 --> 20:54.584
        Why? You afraid         
    you'd give the kid a trauma?

20:54.586 --> 20:56.486
I don't want a trauma           
to go on his record.            

20:58.656 --> 21:00.623
You know, it's a prank.         

21:00.625 --> 21:03.426
After all, when I was a kid,    
you know what I used to do?     

21:03.428 --> 21:05.829
I used to steal hunks of ice    
off of the ice wagon.           

21:05.831 --> 21:08.098
          You stole off a wagon?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.000
  Forty years ago!              

21:10.002 --> 21:13.237
Come on, there's a statue       
of libertations here.           

21:13.239 --> 21:15.839
I'm talking about a prank       
like this kid was a prank.      

21:15.841 --> 21:17.640
     Well, it just happens to be
        the third prank         

21:17.642 --> 21:20.177
    that Andy Farrell has pulled
      on cab drivers this year. 

21:20.179 --> 21:21.578
      Oh, yeah?                 

21:21.580 --> 21:22.679
        Yeah, and the third time

21:22.681 --> 21:24.681
              that the charge   
        was suddenly dropped.   

21:24.683 --> 21:26.283
              Oh.               

21:26.285 --> 21:28.785
                 Well, jeez,    
            nobody told me that.

21:28.787 --> 21:32.189
Well, that's too bad. You       
 could have held out for more.  

21:32.191 --> 21:34.992
 Oh, now, wait a minute there,  
            Roselli.            

21:34.994 --> 21:36.760
      Don't be accusing me      
    of taking a bribe.          

21:36.762 --> 21:40.030
 You know what they call that?  
    Definition of character.    

21:42.200 --> 21:43.767
Here's your wallet,             
Mr. Bunker.                     

21:43.769 --> 21:45.202
Sign here, please.              

21:45.204 --> 21:49.206
    Yeah, well, I'll sign, but  
 let me check it out first, huh?

21:49.208 --> 21:50.407
You know,                       
I'm only sorry                  

21:50.409 --> 21:53.277
that we weren't able to         
get your money back too.        

21:53.279 --> 21:56.213
        I can see that!         
      Where's my 50 bucks?      

21:56.215 --> 21:57.381
     Oh, didn't I tell you?     

21:57.383 --> 21:59.283
         Andy Farrell,          
    the boy who robbed you--    

21:59.285 --> 22:00.650
         Oh, excuse me.         

22:00.652 --> 22:02.786
          The boy who           
     pulled a prank on you      

22:02.788 --> 22:05.655
said the wallet was empty       
    when he found it.           

22:05.657 --> 22:07.391
Hold it. Hold it, he said what? 

22:07.393 --> 22:08.792
        Yeah, we thought        
      it was strange too.       

22:08.794 --> 22:10.794
     Especially since Andy      
was carrying a roll of 50 bucks 

22:10.796 --> 22:12.595
 on him when we picked him up.  

22:12.597 --> 22:14.864
  Sure he was! That was my 50!  

22:14.866 --> 22:16.633
                    Ain't that  
                  a coincidence!

22:16.635 --> 22:18.201
              That's what I said
                to Chuck here.  

22:18.203 --> 22:20.904
    I said, "Chuck, I'll bet you
     that's Mr. Bunker's dough."

22:20.906 --> 22:23.606
        You were right.         

22:23.608 --> 22:26.209
          Then I said,          
     "No, I must be wrong.      

22:26.211 --> 22:29.947
      "How could I suspect      
  a sweet, innocent young boy,  

22:29.949 --> 22:33.083
    especially when nobody's    
    pressing charges?"          

22:34.218 --> 22:37.354
Sign here, please.              

22:37.356 --> 22:39.189
                Yeah, all right.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.924
                     Yeah, yeah,
                     yeah, yeah.

22:40.926 --> 22:45.128
Listen, I see what you police   
          are doing here.       

22:45.130 --> 22:46.596
                        Okay.   

22:46.598 --> 22:48.432
          There's the signature.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.033
                I gotta         
             get back to my cab.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.801
Oh, Mr. Bunker?                 
                    Yeah?       

22:51.803 --> 22:56.239
        Was that your cab parked
        out at the curb, 742-TA?

22:56.241 --> 22:58.708
    Yeah, at the curb. Why?     

22:58.710 --> 23:00.877
You were parked                 
in a no-standing zone.          

23:00.879 --> 23:02.712
They just towed away            
your cab.                       

23:04.082 --> 23:05.849
They can't do that to me!       

23:05.851 --> 23:07.784
  I'm here on police business!  

23:07.786 --> 23:09.086
I'm sorry, Mr. Bunker.          

23:09.088 --> 23:10.787
You can reclaim it              
down at the pier.               

23:10.789 --> 23:11.788
         Yeah, that's all right.

23:11.790 --> 23:13.190
              You just tell them
                  I sent you,   

23:13.192 --> 23:14.591
                 and they'll    
            give it back to you.

23:14.593 --> 23:15.725
        They will?              

23:15.727 --> 23:17.294
             Sure. For 50 bucks.

23:19.030 --> 23:20.630
          Fifty bucks?          

23:20.632 --> 23:23.000
 Look at this, from my wallet,  
        I'm out 50 bucks        

23:23.002 --> 23:24.201
and 50 bucks for the cab?       

23:24.203 --> 23:26.403
        It cost me $100         
    to walk into this joint!    

23:26.405 --> 23:27.570
A hundred and twenty-five.      

23:27.572 --> 23:28.805
A hundred and twenty-five.      

23:28.807 --> 23:31.041
A hundred and twenty-five?      
        What for?               

23:31.043 --> 23:32.242
                Twenty-five     
          for the parking ticket

23:32.244 --> 23:34.611
              you're gonna find 
             on your windshield.

23:41.452 --> 23:43.887
              Oh, yeah.         

23:46.190 --> 23:49.926
All right for youse guys.       

23:49.928 --> 23:51.395
    Tell you something else,    

23:51.397 --> 23:53.997
 this here is highway robbery.  

23:53.999 --> 23:55.198
        No, Mr. Bunker,         

23:55.200 --> 23:57.134
     this here is justice.      

24:14.318 --> 24:15.752
                  Hey! Hey,     
                look at this!   

24:15.754 --> 24:17.787
"Farrell attorney Morrison      

24:17.789 --> 24:20.690
involved in $200,000            
bribe attempt."                 

24:20.692 --> 24:22.325
                Where's that?
