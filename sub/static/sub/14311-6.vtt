WEBVTT

00:06.386 --> 00:08.555
It's not that kind of suit, Mr. O'Hirn.

00:08.722 --> 00:10.516
You will never be able to remove it.

00:10.682 --> 00:13.519
- But it's tough, right, doc?
-Indeed.

00:13.685 --> 00:16.438
But your skin
will fuse to the armor.

00:16.605 --> 00:19.024
A thick, titanium resin armor.

00:19.191 --> 00:20.400
A permanent change.

00:20.567 --> 00:25.656
Is it me, or is your boy
trying to talk my boy out of this?

00:25.822 --> 00:28.033
Look, O'Hirn. You'll be tough.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.702
Tough enough to bring down
you-know-who.

00:30.869 --> 00:32.662
Then what's the holdup?

00:44.925 --> 00:46.093
Let it finish, Otto.

00:46.260 --> 00:48.095
You owe me a success.

00:48.262 --> 00:50.305
No more flukes like the Sandman.

00:50.472 --> 00:53.183
I need super-mercenaries
I can mass-produce.

00:53.350 --> 00:55.644
No matter how many thugs
we have to go through.

00:55.811 --> 00:58.021
Or how many doctors.

01:02.901 --> 01:05.361
What's with the jungle look?

01:05.529 --> 01:08.657
The animal kingdom
offers many useful ideas.

01:08.824 --> 01:13.036
That armor is a part of him now,
a thick, impenetrable hide.

01:13.203 --> 01:17.165
The extras up top there
provide offensive capabilities...

01:17.332 --> 01:19.585
...making him unstoppable.

01:19.751 --> 01:24.256
The good doctor has his quirks,
but this approaches competence.

01:24.423 --> 01:26.925
Your Mr. Lincoln will be pleased.

01:27.092 --> 01:29.261
Ixnay, we don't ever use the I word.

01:29.428 --> 01:32.431
- Call him the Big Man.
- What's going on?

01:32.598 --> 01:36.727
- Mind your own business, O'Hirn.
- Right. My business.

01:36.893 --> 01:38.604
Better get to it, then.

01:44.192 --> 01:47.988
Because the Rhino
don't wanna keep Spider-Man waiting.

02:59.601 --> 03:02.104
<i>Hit it, go.</i>

03:03.271 --> 03:07.484
- Help, police.
- Must be 2000 in here. Score.

03:07.651 --> 03:11.947
Yeah, and Spidey's too busy
popping big bads to worry about us.

03:12.114 --> 03:14.324
Say my name,
and I magically appear.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.202
Okay, you should
fasten your seatbelt.

03:17.369 --> 03:19.788
- And you should pull over.
- Right, okay, yeah.

03:19.955 --> 03:21.832
No way.

03:38.014 --> 03:39.349
Surf's up.

04:13.425 --> 04:16.344
So guess it's fall formal time
in Midtown.

04:16.511 --> 04:19.389
- Pete ask you yet?
- Pete says he isn't going.

04:19.555 --> 04:22.058
Tell you what. Let me be your date.

04:22.225 --> 04:24.227
I'll even dance.

04:25.854 --> 04:27.105
You don't have to dance.

04:27.272 --> 04:30.358
Plus, if you say yes,
I promise to stop asking.

04:30.525 --> 04:33.445
Parker. I pay you
for front-page material.

04:33.653 --> 04:35.781
This stuff belongs
back with the funnies.

04:35.947 --> 04:37.407
So you don't want them?

04:37.574 --> 04:41.036
Not the point. Here's the point.
Quit harassing my secretary...

04:41.203 --> 04:43.246
...and get me a Page 1
web-head blowout.

04:43.413 --> 04:47.292
Trust me, Mr. Jameson, when
Spidey goes into action, I'll be there.

04:47.459 --> 04:50.462
Listen, you insufferable whelp.
When your publisher--

04:50.670 --> 04:54.132
You! Benny!
I said corned beef, not pastrami.

04:54.299 --> 04:57.093
- What? You wanna give me gas?
- You're only four years older.

04:57.260 --> 05:00.972
When you're 7O and I'm 66,
I'll seem quite the catch.

05:01.973 --> 05:05.268
- All right, I'll think about it.
- That's great.

05:05.435 --> 05:08.563
- You won't regret it.
- It's just a maybe.

05:16.071 --> 05:17.572
I'm wearing her down.

05:26.414 --> 05:27.749
Goodness, what's this?

05:27.916 --> 05:30.210
It's a great day.

05:31.586 --> 05:33.588
For starters, I sold more pics.

05:33.755 --> 05:35.841
Here's 90 percent to pay the bills.

05:36.007 --> 05:38.134
And 10 percent
for my new-camera fund.

05:38.301 --> 05:40.345
And that's not even the best news.

05:40.512 --> 05:43.431
I'm going to the formal,
Aunt May. I got a date.

05:43.598 --> 05:45.016
Almost for sure.

05:45.225 --> 05:46.935
That's wonderful, Peter.

05:47.102 --> 05:48.937
I had hoped
you'd change your mind.

05:49.104 --> 05:52.107
So I took in your uncle's tuxedo
to save you money on a rental.

05:52.274 --> 05:54.943
The corsage and car service
will be expensive enough.

05:55.110 --> 05:56.319
Car service?

05:56.486 --> 05:58.780
This'll barely pay for the corsage.

05:58.947 --> 06:01.491
What am I gonna do?
I can't ask Betty to take the bus.

06:01.658 --> 06:03.952
Betty? Who's Betty?

06:07.789 --> 06:10.333
Miss Brant.
I'm May Parker, Peter's aunt.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.836
Might I buy you a cup of coffee?

06:13.336 --> 06:15.213
Well, it's official.

06:15.380 --> 06:19.634
I'm going to the fall formal
with Glory Grant.

06:19.801 --> 06:24.180
I can top that, I'm almost definitely
going with Betty Brant.

06:24.347 --> 06:28.018
Hey, Grant, Brant. Our girls rhyme.

06:28.184 --> 06:31.146
Puny Parker's got a date? Right.

06:31.313 --> 06:34.482
You wouldn't know her, Flash.
She's 20 years old and hot.

06:34.649 --> 06:38.987
Come on, at least tell a good lie.
Bet you show up without any date.

06:39.154 --> 06:41.573
- Or you don't show up at all.
- I'll take that bet.

06:41.781 --> 06:44.159
Loser dresses as a cheerleader
for Halloween.

06:44.326 --> 06:46.161
You're on.

06:46.328 --> 06:48.872
Oh, look, my girl's texting me now.

06:49.706 --> 06:53.168
Having coffee with Aunt May.

06:53.335 --> 06:55.003
How old did you say your girl was?

06:56.171 --> 06:58.214
I gotta go.

07:06.681 --> 07:09.893
No one goes up to the <i>Bugle</i>
without a pass, sir.

07:10.435 --> 07:12.729
Make an exception.

07:16.691 --> 07:18.234
Hit 22, please.

07:18.401 --> 07:20.779
These don't work so good
on the little buttons.

07:20.946 --> 07:25.200
Actually, 22's already pressed.

07:25.367 --> 07:27.869
<i>So you</i> going <i>to the Bugle?</i>

07:28.036 --> 07:31.623
Yeah, your name ain't Parker, is it?

07:32.207 --> 07:33.875
No point
in paying the city prices...

07:34.042 --> 07:36.044
...when there's perfectly good
coffee here.

07:36.211 --> 07:39.714
I do appreciate a sensible girl.

07:49.516 --> 07:53.103
Bring me Peter Parker.

07:53.269 --> 07:55.814
What does that awful man
want with my nephew?

07:55.981 --> 07:58.525
- We'll ask Peter later.
- I ain't stupid.

07:58.692 --> 08:01.486
Peter Parker
takes all the web-creep's pictures.

08:04.531 --> 08:08.368
I've gotta hurry.
Before Aunt May destroys everything.

08:08.535 --> 08:10.453
Who do you think you are?

08:10.620 --> 08:12.205
Or what do you think you are?

08:12.414 --> 08:16.126
I'll give you 15 seconds to write me
a check for these damages or--

08:17.669 --> 08:20.547
I mean, how may I be of service?

08:20.714 --> 08:22.549
Peter Parker.

08:23.216 --> 08:25.176
Now.

08:30.890 --> 08:32.392
No, don't-- Parker?

08:33.058 --> 08:34.519
Parker the photographer?

08:37.522 --> 08:39.566
Never met the guy.

08:40.025 --> 08:43.068
No address, either.
Only makes contact by e-mail.

08:45.447 --> 08:49.784
What a fine, brave man
to protect my nephew that way.

08:49.951 --> 08:53.496
I'm glad Peter's found
such good people to work with.

08:53.663 --> 08:56.916
But you're too old for him, dear.

09:04.924 --> 09:08.428
- What do you think, I'm stupid?
- Well, you are dressed stupid.

09:17.771 --> 09:19.355
Put me down.

09:22.859 --> 09:25.195
It's for your own safety, picklepuss.

09:25.779 --> 09:29.032
- What do you want with Parker?
- You. Just you.

09:29.199 --> 09:32.202
And payback for all the times
you took me down.

09:32.368 --> 09:34.537
- O'Hirn?
- Not anymore.

09:34.704 --> 09:37.123
Call me Rhino.

09:39.793 --> 09:42.295
Hey, watch it,
glass doors are expensive.

09:48.802 --> 09:51.387
Your goop's useless now, creep.

09:51.596 --> 09:55.809
First Marko becomes Sandman, now
this? What's the Big Man's next move?

09:55.975 --> 10:00.188
Turning Flash Thompson
into the Belligerent Bug-Zapper?

10:12.826 --> 10:16.996
If I can't stop this bruiser,
maybe <i>2</i> feet of concrete will.

10:24.337 --> 10:25.839
No.

10:41.938 --> 10:44.440
Thrill ride.

10:49.404 --> 10:50.530
Attention Rhino.

10:50.947 --> 10:53.366
Lay down flat in your crater.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.243
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

10:55.410 --> 10:57.871
You see them now?

11:20.602 --> 11:23.605
This one's mine, detective.
Hey, needle-nose.

11:25.940 --> 11:27.275
Party's over here.

11:39.329 --> 11:40.997
You like being hunted, freak?

11:41.206 --> 11:42.832
Would you please
look who's talking?

11:42.999 --> 11:46.419
I may be a freak,
but I'm not a coward.

11:46.586 --> 11:50.465
Even the old O'Hirn
never ran away scared.

11:52.592 --> 11:53.635
I'm scared all right.

11:53.801 --> 11:55.595
Scared some bystander
will get hurt.

11:55.762 --> 11:58.097
Gotta lure rawhide
someplace deserted.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.607
Hurry up, hippo-

12:10.109 --> 12:13.613
Where do you find deserted
in a city of 8 million?

12:19.619 --> 12:20.703
Stupid truck.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.122
Made me lose Spider-creep.

13:00.660 --> 13:03.079
That's gonna leave a mark.

13:12.422 --> 13:14.882
This always works in the cartoons.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.554
Television so cannot be trusted.

13:22.849 --> 13:27.353
Remember what I did
to them bowling balls'?

13:33.151 --> 13:34.777
- Wait, wait.
- What?

13:34.944 --> 13:36.446
Weight.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.118
Where'd you g0?

13:50.209 --> 13:51.502
How's that for confident?

13:51.669 --> 13:54.005
He stops to satisfy
before smashing me.

13:54.172 --> 13:56.758
Unless it's not confidence.

13:58.926 --> 14:01.637
Okay, break's over.

14:11.564 --> 14:12.899
You missed.

14:20.073 --> 14:21.157
Over here, moose.

14:21.324 --> 14:23.868
Let's play follow the leader.

14:24.035 --> 14:26.537
Think you can hide
from me down there?

14:26.704 --> 14:27.997
Think again.

14:29.374 --> 14:30.666
Hot enough for you?

14:30.833 --> 14:33.628
Come on, you big lug,
let's go for a run.

14:48.267 --> 14:51.521
Can't help noticing
you've stopped spouting off.

14:53.064 --> 14:56.275
What's the matter?
Mouth a little dry?

15:11.791 --> 15:15.253
And to think my mistake was
trying to crack open that hide of yours.

15:15.420 --> 15:18.673
Nothing can do that.
Big Man's guys told me.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.967
I'm impenetrable.

15:21.134 --> 15:24.720
Too true. And if nothing can penetrate,
you can't perspire.

15:24.887 --> 15:26.889
Your face is sweating
for your whole body.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.100
It's probably enough
under most conditions.

15:29.267 --> 15:31.144
But in a steam tunnel...

15:31.310 --> 15:34.272
I gotta get out of here.

15:37.650 --> 15:39.819
Yeah, good luck with that.

16:03.926 --> 16:06.387
Come one, come all.
Before your very eyes...

16:06.554 --> 16:09.056
...the world's largest
dehydrated turtle.

16:09.223 --> 16:12.059
I swear I'm gonna crush you.

16:12.226 --> 16:14.854
Promised Big Man I'd crush you.

16:15.021 --> 16:19.233
Crush you. Crush you. Crush you.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.652
Are we losing it a bit, Alexander?

16:21.819 --> 16:24.780
Only Mama calls me Alexander.

16:24.947 --> 16:26.741
You're not my mama.

16:26.908 --> 16:29.744
Not my mama. Mama.

16:29.911 --> 16:33.414
- Yes, I think we are.
- Mama?

16:33.581 --> 16:36.125
Do I have to go to school?

16:36.292 --> 16:39.545
So, Alexander, tell Mama:

16:39.712 --> 16:41.422
Who's the Big Man?

16:41.589 --> 16:45.760
Ixnay, we don't ever use the B word.

16:45.927 --> 16:49.847
Call him Mr. Lincoln.

16:54.268 --> 16:56.020
You're gonna need a crane.

16:58.105 --> 16:59.273
I'm impressed.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.526
Rhino's still underground.

17:01.692 --> 17:06.614
And OsCorp's already got the contract
to build his prison cell.

17:06.781 --> 17:09.659
After our success
containing Sandman...

17:09.825 --> 17:11.618
...whom else would the city call?

17:11.786 --> 17:16.165
Meaning you get paid
coming and going. Sweet.

17:16.332 --> 17:19.460
Very. But these midtown brawls...

17:19.627 --> 17:22.338
People are beginning
to ask questions.

17:22.505 --> 17:25.049
Best to let things cool off for a bit.

17:25.215 --> 17:29.053
We cool off,
when the Big Man says so, see?

17:29.220 --> 17:33.266
Or do you want people to know
who created Freak 1 and Freak 2?

17:33.432 --> 17:38.271
Please, there's nothing to trace them
back to OsCorp or myself.

17:38.437 --> 17:42.275
Really? Tell that to Dr. Octavius.

17:42.441 --> 17:43.568
Hey, Dad, great news.

17:43.734 --> 17:45.528
I got straight A's on my midterms.

17:45.695 --> 17:50.116
I made varsity football, first-string. I
have a date to formal with the hottest--

17:50.283 --> 17:54.161
Harry, can't you see I'm in a meeting?
Get out.

17:54.328 --> 17:56.789
Yes, sir. Sorry.

17:56.956 --> 17:59.875
Didn't mean to interrupt.

18:02.128 --> 18:04.255
That wall-crawler's
as bad as the Rhino.

18:04.422 --> 18:05.673
I'll sue them blind.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.758
Is it safe to come out yet?

18:07.925 --> 18:10.636
Peter, were you here
this whole time?

18:10.803 --> 18:14.223
It's okay. I was hiding.
I'm good at hiding.

18:14.390 --> 18:17.143
I can also be very heroic, honest.

18:17.310 --> 18:19.061
Could we talk for a minute?

18:19.228 --> 18:21.897
About tonight, I can't go with you.

18:22.064 --> 18:25.901
I'm too old for you,
and it's just too weird.

18:26.068 --> 18:27.153
You think I'm weird?

18:27.320 --> 18:30.740
Oh, no, you're not weird, Peter.
It's weird.

18:30.906 --> 18:33.034
I'm sorry.

18:33.576 --> 18:38.080
Oh, dear. How disappointing.
I imagine you need some time alone.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.832
I'll find my own way home.

18:39.999 --> 18:41.917
<i>I gotta make something go right.</i>

18:42.543 --> 18:43.836
Mr. Foswell?

18:44.003 --> 18:46.756
Do you know anything
about a Mr. Lincoln?

18:46.922 --> 18:49.675
- Our 16th President?
- Not that Lincoln.

18:49.842 --> 18:53.763
This one might also go by the name
Big Man?

18:54.305 --> 18:56.474
You must mean
L. Thompson Lincoln.

18:56.641 --> 18:58.684
Yeah, a rumor surfaces
every few years...

18:58.851 --> 19:00.770
...that he's some kind of crime lord...

19:00.936 --> 19:02.396
...but, hey, I checked it out.

19:02.563 --> 19:05.524
Lincoln looks a little odd,
but he's one of the good guys.

19:05.691 --> 19:07.943
A true philanthropist.
Straight as they come.

19:08.110 --> 19:11.697
Hey, if there is a Big Man out there,
his name's not Lincoln.

19:30.883 --> 19:32.218
I'm here to see Mr. Lincoln.

19:32.385 --> 19:33.928
You should make an appointment.

19:34.095 --> 19:36.263
But perhaps
we'll make an exception...

19:36.430 --> 19:38.057
...for the hero of the day.

19:38.224 --> 19:40.393
I am I. Thompson Lincoln.

19:40.559 --> 19:42.103
Please, you're the Big Man.

19:42.269 --> 19:45.231
In my life,
I've been called many names.

19:45.398 --> 19:49.235
- My favorite is Tombstone.
- Back off.

19:49.402 --> 19:52.363
I just took down the Rhino.
A pale guy in a suit doesn't s--

19:57.118 --> 20:00.121
Don't move. Just listen.

20:00.287 --> 20:03.332
And I'll teach you the facts of life.

20:06.001 --> 20:10.464
The Big Man, whomever he might be,
has nothing against heroes.

20:10.631 --> 20:13.759
No hero can thwart enough crime
to dent his income.

20:13.926 --> 20:15.428
But you--

20:15.594 --> 20:18.305
You frighten criminals
off the street entirely.

20:18.472 --> 20:21.100
Except when you're off
battling the likes of the Rhino.

20:21.267 --> 20:24.311
Then the Big Man's profitable
army of petty thugs...

20:24.478 --> 20:27.523
...think themselves
beneath the Spider-Man's notice.

20:27.690 --> 20:31.569
So as long as I keep fighting crime,
you'll keep making bigger and badder--

20:31.736 --> 20:33.696
Now, you're learning.

20:33.863 --> 20:35.740
But there is a way out.

20:35.906 --> 20:37.825
Come work for me.

20:37.992 --> 20:40.494
You can still save the world
like a good hero.

20:41.454 --> 20:42.830
I'll even pay you.

20:42.997 --> 20:46.375
All you have to remember
is to look the other way on occasion.

20:46.542 --> 20:49.503
On any occasion I choose.

20:52.673 --> 20:56.010
I can't ever look the other way again.
Let's finish this.

20:56.969 --> 20:58.179
If you insist.

20:59.764 --> 21:03.267
Officers, Spider-Man has trespassed
on my property...

21:03.434 --> 21:06.270
...assaulted my employees
and threatened my person.

21:06.437 --> 21:08.481
Wait. You can't listen to him.

21:08.647 --> 21:09.940
He's the bad guy. He's--

21:11.901 --> 21:13.652
Freeze, Spider-Man. You're under--

21:18.032 --> 21:20.910
I never ran from the cops before.
I mean, this reeks.

21:21.076 --> 21:22.411
I've won all the battles...

21:22.578 --> 21:24.747
...and never came close
to winning the war.

21:24.914 --> 21:27.291
But Tombstone
did make one mistake.

21:27.458 --> 21:29.376
Now I know there is a war.

21:29.543 --> 21:31.712
So bring it on.

21:34.423 --> 21:37.134
Oh, see? A perfect fit.

21:38.052 --> 21:39.929
But what's the point?

21:40.095 --> 21:42.723
Betty said no. Gwen's not home.

21:42.890 --> 21:44.683
I already lost the bet to Flash.

21:44.850 --> 21:47.186
Showing up alone
would just make it worse.

21:47.353 --> 21:49.980
Well then, isn't it lucky
that Anna Watson's niece...

21:50.147 --> 21:52.817
...that sweet Mary Jane,
is on her way over?

21:52.983 --> 21:55.402
Miss Wonderful Personality?

21:55.569 --> 21:57.196
Is coming here?

21:57.363 --> 21:59.615
- Now?
- There she is.

21:59.782 --> 22:01.325
My, what a lovely dress.

22:01.492 --> 22:03.244
Here, I bought her corsage.

22:03.410 --> 22:06.747
- Couldn't afford the limousine, but--
- You planned this?

22:06.914 --> 22:09.333
Aunt May, you're an evil mastermind.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.169
Just answer the door, dear.

22:16.757 --> 22:20.678
You mean,
you're Mary Jane Watson?

22:22.555 --> 22:27.059
Face it, tiger.
You just hit the jackpot.
