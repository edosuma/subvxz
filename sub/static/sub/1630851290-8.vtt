00:09.444 --> 00:11.489
<i>Previously on
Chapelwaite...</i>

00:11.620 --> 00:14.362
Faith, no, no!

00:16.277 --> 00:19.367
Behold! This fraud!

00:19.497 --> 00:22.326
<i>The madness
suffered by every Boone </i>

00:22.457 --> 00:24.502
<i>is connected to this book.</i>

00:24.633 --> 00:26.330
<i>I had a vision
when I opened it. </i>

00:29.420 --> 00:31.727
<i>Eternal night.</i>

00:31.857 --> 00:34.556
<i>The undead rule,</i>

00:34.686 --> 00:36.297
<i>and man is meat.</i>

00:36.427 --> 00:38.429
It's all death in this book.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.692
It's the end of everything.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.477
You said the only way
to be rid of your curse

00:42.607 --> 00:43.652
was to return it to the undead.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.219
What?

00:45.349 --> 00:46.785
<i>
It's with Mary Dennison.</i>

00:46.916 --> 00:48.178
<i>She's restrained in the cellar.</i>

00:48.309 --> 00:49.310
She's one of them now.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.441
<i>
Phillip and Stephen</i>

00:50.572 --> 00:52.530
will come for this book
tonight.

00:52.661 --> 00:53.618
<i>We have to keep them
out of the house. </i>

00:53.749 --> 00:56.534
<i>We need planks.
And paint. </i>

00:56.665 --> 00:59.450
Give us the book!

01:00.582 --> 01:02.279
- Heave!

01:02.410 --> 01:03.541
Father!

01:11.897 --> 01:14.291
No!

01:14.422 --> 01:17.251
We will go to Chapelwaite

01:17.381 --> 01:21.168
<i>and take what is ours.</i>

02:42.379 --> 02:43.641
Jakub is out there.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.949
With how many,
I can't say.

02:47.079 --> 02:49.430
But we have our plan
to defend the house.

02:50.518 --> 02:53.956
And everyone knows
their positions.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.653
We have enough wood

02:55.784 --> 02:58.265
to cover any windows or doors
that get breached.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.011
Constable,
how are you feeling?

03:06.142 --> 03:07.883
Well enough
to see daylight.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.712
Good. It's on you
to keep them off the barn.

03:10.842 --> 03:13.018
We cannot allow them to find
the tunnel into the walls.

03:13.149 --> 03:15.760
If they do, we'll start
to lose the house.

03:15.891 --> 03:18.285
In that event,
we'll seal the last barricade

03:18.415 --> 03:20.417
and constrict our perimeter
to the dining room and kitchen.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.508
If we can't hold there, then...

03:25.727 --> 03:27.859
then we retreat
to the cellar as one,

03:27.990 --> 03:29.426
make our final stand.

03:31.036 --> 03:32.908
Better we go there now.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.866
That would give us
no chance to confront our enemy,

03:34.997 --> 03:36.607
nowhere to go.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.305
They'd breach
the cellar door,

03:38.435 --> 03:39.436
burn us out.

03:39.567 --> 03:40.829
We wouldn't last the hour.

03:40.959 --> 03:41.917
I have experience

03:42.047 --> 03:44.311
defending ships
against marauders.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.792
With proper fortification,
five can hold 50.

03:49.011 --> 03:49.838
We have that.

03:53.798 --> 03:56.192
Tonight will reveal
much about ourselves.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.760
There will be times
when you lose heart,

04:00.196 --> 04:01.632
and you want to quit.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.246
Do not.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.730
Minister, would you
say a prayer?

04:13.818 --> 04:15.864
I think it might
do us all some good.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.440
Better say one for yourselves.

04:35.187 --> 04:36.667
I'll say one.

04:41.977 --> 04:44.675
The Lord is my refuge
and fortress;

04:44.806 --> 04:46.503
my God in Him I will trust.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.723
No evil shall befall you,

04:48.853 --> 04:50.986
nor shall any plague
come near your dwelling;

04:51.116 --> 04:53.989
for He shall give His angels
charge upon you,

04:54.119 --> 04:55.425
to keep you in your ways.

04:56.644 --> 04:57.862
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.517
Anything?

07:10.647 --> 07:11.605
Nothing yet.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.999
What do you think
they're waiting for?

07:16.261 --> 07:18.350
Well, I imagine they're trying
to formulate their own plan.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.614
If they are,
we'll be ready for them.

07:23.225 --> 07:24.487
I'm proud of you.

07:27.055 --> 07:28.012
Both of you.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.192
You've come far
from the little deck rats

07:34.323 --> 07:35.716
I ferried around the world.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.459
You're a good boy.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.941
I'll see us through this.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.600
George...

07:51.949 --> 07:52.950
You need to get back upstairs.

07:54.256 --> 07:55.300
I want to check on Mary.

07:55.431 --> 07:56.737
Not too long now.

08:20.456 --> 08:23.111
George, I'm your wife.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.417
How can you keep me bound
like a wild animal?

08:25.548 --> 08:27.985
Phillip Boone
stole my wife from me.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.247
That's not true.

08:29.378 --> 08:32.424
I'm different
only because I know death.

08:32.555 --> 08:35.732
I've been there...
and returned.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.909
But we all die one day.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.521
So...
am I really so different?

08:42.609 --> 08:45.568
The dead should not
walk the earth.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.049
But we do.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.661
We were to spend
eternity together...

08:53.097 --> 08:53.968
...in Heaven.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.884
There is no Heaven.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.628
You have faith,
but I've been there.

09:03.412 --> 09:06.546
There is life,
and there is nothing.

09:08.025 --> 09:09.853
We've been told lies.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.687
That wound
in your stomach is deep.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.777
I can smell it.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.866
Soon you'll be nothing, George.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.652
Not alone.

09:26.522 --> 09:29.090
Not a spirit.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.700
Just mud and bone.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.616
But I'll be alive.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.317
No, no.
I have to go upstairs.

09:39.448 --> 09:40.797
I'm hungry.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.843
It's more than hunger.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.888
It burns, George.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.066
If you love me,
you'll feed me.

09:55.682 --> 09:59.207
Come close.
No need to cut again.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.142
No, I need my strength.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.452
They don't care about you.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.281
You're dying, George.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.457
I can save you.

10:32.588 --> 10:33.894
We can be together.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.941
Drink from me.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.697
How well
do you know Dennison?

10:57.526 --> 10:58.832
I've known him my whole life.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.142
Would you vouch
for his character?

11:06.361 --> 11:07.667
In what regard?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.107
I saw him feeding Mary.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.327
Was he feeding on her?

11:16.458 --> 11:19.113
No. But when faced
with one's own mortality...

11:20.288 --> 11:21.637
who knows what
desperate men may do?

11:21.768 --> 11:23.160
We can't risk him
becoming like Mary.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.163
We won't.

11:26.294 --> 11:27.904
I'll handle it.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.255
Your prayer was
much needed for morale.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.083
- Thank you.
- It's funny.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.259
God is most of what
I think about now.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.568
All religions claim
that their god

11:39.699 --> 11:42.005
to be the one and only.

11:42.136 --> 11:45.008
And now these vampires
return from the grave

11:45.139 --> 11:48.229
and tell us their god
is the one true God.

11:48.359 --> 11:51.014
So who are we to believe?
Whose version of God is real?

11:51.145 --> 11:54.365
Whichever god has the
strongest army at the moment

11:54.496 --> 11:56.019
is the most real.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.456
So the winner tonight
chooses the next God?

11:58.587 --> 12:01.111
The winner in all wars
decides the truth...

12:02.504 --> 12:03.897
God included.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.290
And that's it?

12:18.738 --> 12:22.350
I always thought of God
as love.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.699
Simple.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.920
I prefer your interpretation
to others.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.407
Once this is over,

12:36.538 --> 12:38.888
my mother and I will be
moving to New York.

12:40.063 --> 12:41.586
I made a promise to myself

12:41.717 --> 12:44.415
that I would get her
out of this town.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.374
That's the plan, at least.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.380
Might you build ships there?

12:56.384 --> 12:58.081
We shouldn't get ahead
of ourselves.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.256
Why not?

13:01.737 --> 13:03.260
Well, I'll still
have the book.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.264
- The curse will follow.
- Charles, please.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.182
Just for one moment...

13:37.468 --> 13:39.253
All clear, Martin?

13:39.383 --> 13:40.341
Nothing here.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.300
Mind the front as well.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.319
The fires before us
come for me.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.062
Don't fool yourself,
Minister.

14:06.193 --> 14:07.890
They're here for all of us.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.158
I understand all you've lost,

14:16.377 --> 14:18.248
but isn't that when
we lean on God the most?

14:19.641 --> 14:20.642
For some.

14:23.688 --> 14:27.170
But when Phillip Boone's hand
was around my throat,

14:27.301 --> 14:32.001
his grip was infinite...

14:32.132 --> 14:33.133
and bottomless.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.005
It was the death
of everything.

14:37.485 --> 14:40.053
I realized that... that
"nothing" is what I deserve.

14:40.183 --> 14:44.187
- That's not true.
- It is, Rebecca.

14:44.318 --> 14:47.408
You of all people know
that I am a fraud.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.366
You and your mother.

14:49.497 --> 14:52.456
We never thought of you
as a fraud.

14:52.587 --> 14:53.936
Just another flawed man.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.244
The kind that God favors
now and then.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.160
The kind who needs Him most.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.292
Isn't that what you always
used to preach?

15:08.603 --> 15:09.952
Empty words.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.608
You don't need faith
to fight, Minister,

15:13.738 --> 15:15.653
but you do need to fight.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.221
If not for yourself,
then for something else.

15:19.657 --> 15:22.617
May I remind you that there are
children in this house,

15:22.747 --> 15:25.185
and they deserve more
than the next few hours to live.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.633
How's the wound?

15:38.763 --> 15:40.330
I'll make the night,

15:40.461 --> 15:42.245
if that's what
you're worried about.

15:44.465 --> 15:45.335
I am.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.121
I want you to live.

15:53.691 --> 15:56.956
But there are conditions
worse than death.

16:02.526 --> 16:06.008
Mary was 12 years old
when we first met.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.230
And the prettiest thing
I have ever seen.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.840
I'm sure she was.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.364
We married
four years later.

16:14.495 --> 16:17.454
I never wanted to be
a day without her.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.458
For me there was never
any other,

16:23.417 --> 16:25.201
nor will there ever be.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.380
Must be...

16:31.991 --> 16:35.603
...must be tempting to want
to love someone forever.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.826
I love my daughter Loa.

16:41.957 --> 16:43.263
I always will.

16:45.482 --> 16:47.223
But...

16:47.354 --> 16:49.834
I don't believe
these vampires love.

16:49.965 --> 16:53.490
I've seen where their life
leads, Jerusalem's Lot.

16:56.319 --> 16:57.668
No love remains.

16:57.799 --> 17:00.802
Our Loa and Mary are gone.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.499
Mr. Boone.

17:03.674 --> 17:07.156
I will fight for you
and for that book.

17:08.636 --> 17:10.551
But don't tell me
how to handle my wife.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.037
I won't mention it again.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.869
But if I see you down there
alone with her--

17:25.000 --> 17:27.176
I guess we'll be keeping
an eye on each other, then.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.138
You know,
I saved Phillip Boone.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.402
I was 17 years old,

17:35.532 --> 17:37.317
and I saved his life.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.407
And your father's.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.149
What are you talking about?

17:43.279 --> 17:44.933
The town knew

17:45.064 --> 17:48.458
that your grandmother
Silence had gone mad.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.417
She hadn't been
seen in weeks.

17:51.592 --> 17:54.595
There was... concern
for the children.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.075
So...

17:57.337 --> 17:58.425
I rode up here,

17:59.861 --> 18:02.255
found Silence
hanging herself...

18:03.560 --> 18:06.824
and the two boys
from that elm tree down there.

18:06.955 --> 18:09.305
I cut Phillip
and your father down,

18:09.436 --> 18:12.656
but Silence, she...
she fought me off.

18:15.833 --> 18:19.315
Imagine if I hadn't saved
those two boys?

18:19.446 --> 18:21.926
No Boone curse.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.580
I'd still have Mary,

18:25.539 --> 18:27.454
and Phillip Boone
would be dead.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.151
Really dead.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.414
And you...

18:33.024 --> 18:35.766
you would have
never been born.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.681
Consider that
the next time you walk up

18:37.812 --> 18:39.248
behind me with a gun.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.223
Keep watch here.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.356
Protect the barn at all costs.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.753
What are you up to?

19:56.499 --> 19:57.979
What is that?

19:58.109 --> 19:59.720
The end of the road.

20:00.982 --> 20:02.462
Back to your post.

20:09.469 --> 20:10.774
Sweet Jesus.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.574
He's moving!
Stay vigilant!

20:30.054 --> 20:31.404
My God.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.713
He means to intimidate.

20:39.629 --> 20:42.241
Charles, I never want
to become like him.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.246
Then cry out
if you see anything.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.706
What is it?

21:12.836 --> 21:15.012
It's the man
Father told us about.

21:15.143 --> 21:16.492
Shoot him.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.712
It won't work.
We have to wait.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.289
It's okay.
He can't get in.

21:47.958 --> 21:50.396
That thing is out there.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.407
Is it the devil?

22:03.017 --> 22:05.541
You give him
too much credit, son.

22:05.672 --> 22:08.414
He was a man;
now he's less.

22:12.156 --> 22:13.506
He's moving to the front.

22:38.879 --> 22:40.924
The crosses held.

22:41.055 --> 22:42.143
Doesn't matter
if you or I believe

22:42.273 --> 22:44.580
in the cross, Martin,
as long as they do.

22:45.886 --> 22:48.715
Jakub will send
his acolytes now.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.152
They'll try to find ways in.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.545
They're mortal.

22:53.676 --> 22:54.895
Make them pay.

23:39.679 --> 23:40.636
Here they come!

23:50.603 --> 23:51.517
Charles!

23:53.823 --> 23:54.998
Two ran around back.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.654
When you see them, shoot!

23:58.785 --> 24:00.787
Even if just to ward them off.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.919
If they get in,
the undead are next.

24:13.147 --> 24:14.235
- Did you get 'em?
- I don't think so.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.758
It's hard to see.
Reload.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.083
There's one
coming to the front!

24:55.972 --> 24:57.887
I can see you.

25:00.281 --> 25:01.978
You're the minister.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.632
I knew Faith.

25:03.763 --> 25:05.547
She was our sister.

25:05.678 --> 25:07.157
Go away.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.029
Don't make me shoot you.

25:10.117 --> 25:12.293
I was there
when she died.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.078
It was terrible.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.558
She begged for her life.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.605
We just kept stabbing her.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.825
She wouldn't stop crying.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.566
Don't you mock her.

25:24.697 --> 25:27.743
- Who are you talking to?
- Faith's minister.

25:27.874 --> 25:29.005
- Oh, be gone, you sonofabitch.

25:30.746 --> 25:35.142
Minister, you don't have
to end up like Faith.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.231
Give Jakub the book.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.887
Our god doesn't care
that you're an adulterer.

25:41.017 --> 25:42.889
Lies mean nothing to him.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.760
He makes no judgment.

25:44.891 --> 25:46.109
He welcomes the sinner.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.722
You can fornicate

25:49.852 --> 25:51.506
with as many women
as you want.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.988
You're all going to die
in there if you don't.

25:55.118 --> 25:58.861
Why fight for a god
who doesn't care about you?

25:58.992 --> 26:02.735
The Worm is so much
stronger and wiser.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.737
Give Jakub the book.

26:04.867 --> 26:05.868
Save them all.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.917
What did you do to my child?

26:11.047 --> 26:12.571
Your child?

26:13.397 --> 26:15.748
My son.
Where is he?

26:17.967 --> 26:19.273
It's back
with its father,

26:19.403 --> 26:20.927
where it belongs.

26:22.319 --> 26:26.454
- What do you mean?

26:26.585 --> 26:30.240
Faith never told you
the truth about her child.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.068
It wasn't yours.

26:33.548 --> 26:35.724
The baby was Jakub's.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.598
She was his favorite.

26:39.728 --> 26:44.037
Every scar you kissed
was Jakub's bite.

26:44.167 --> 26:48.084
You threw your life away
for Jakub's whore.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.611
Give us the book,
Minister.

27:11.586 --> 27:12.935
Rebecca?

27:14.589 --> 27:15.895
- Are you all right?
- The window.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.160
Did I shoot one?

27:20.290 --> 27:21.204
You did.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.210
Reload. Reload now.

27:27.341 --> 27:28.821
- We can stop this.
- What are you doing here?

27:28.951 --> 27:30.039
Give 'em the damn book.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.955
If our god is a falsehood,
then so is theirs.

27:33.086 --> 27:35.175
- Get back to your post!
- They cannot raise a god

27:35.305 --> 27:38.918
- if none exist!
- Do not test me!

27:39.048 --> 27:40.833
Now go back
to the living room!

27:48.318 --> 27:49.493
Charles, what if he...

27:49.624 --> 27:51.191
I'll kill him myself.

27:54.629 --> 27:56.675
Shit. You stay here.

28:00.417 --> 28:01.767
What was it?

28:03.116 --> 28:04.683
I think they're
trying to breach this floor.

28:05.988 --> 28:07.163
Back upstairs!

28:08.295 --> 28:09.209
I have this.

28:26.139 --> 28:27.183
Shit.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.229
Rebecca!

29:13.360 --> 29:14.927
Honor told me
you might need some help.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.276
Ah, I'm all right now.

29:16.406 --> 29:17.886
Is anyone out there?

29:18.017 --> 29:20.193
- Not right now.
- Rebecca.

29:20.323 --> 29:21.629
Tane.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.544
I think one of them's
in the house.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.372
There's a broken window
upstairs.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.287
I searched all the bedrooms,
found nothing.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.202
Just move with caution.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.856
I'm gonna search
the rest of the house.

29:30.986 --> 29:32.292
Tane, come with me.

29:32.422 --> 29:34.424
- If anyone is in here...
- I know what to do.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.600
You let them have it.

29:46.262 --> 29:48.003
It's quiet outside.
Do you think they've given up?

29:48.134 --> 29:50.223
No. One may be inside.

29:50.353 --> 29:53.139
- I've told the others.
- A vampire?

29:53.269 --> 29:54.662
Whatever it is, I'll find it.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.620
Tane, you listen to me now.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.971
You be your sister's eyes
while her back is turned.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.190
- All right?
- We'll be careful.

30:03.714 --> 30:06.021
Why is this door open?

30:06.152 --> 30:07.196
Minister Burroughs
is down there.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.198
He said he needed
to check on Mary.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.079
What are you doing here?

30:20.209 --> 30:21.558
I don't understand
this world anymore.

30:21.689 --> 30:22.516
Did you intend
to take the book?

30:22.646 --> 30:24.344
Everything I thought
I was is gone.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.302
Did you mean to take
the book?

30:29.044 --> 30:30.916
I did.

30:31.046 --> 30:32.221
What stopped you?

30:34.441 --> 30:35.398
That thing...

30:39.141 --> 30:40.316
...in the tub.

30:41.752 --> 30:42.971
Put the gun down.

30:45.582 --> 30:46.975
Put it down.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.511
I know your kind.

31:01.642 --> 31:03.122
Your whole life,

31:03.252 --> 31:06.560
you run to God
for every hardship

31:06.690 --> 31:08.431
because "God provides."

31:08.562 --> 31:11.565
You credit God
with every victory,

31:11.695 --> 31:14.263
even if you've done
the work and sweat yourself.

31:14.394 --> 31:17.745
You blame every defeat
on God's will,

31:17.876 --> 31:19.486
especially when the failure

31:19.616 --> 31:22.271
is from your own
ignorance or weakness.

31:22.402 --> 31:25.535
Believe or don't believe,
I don't care.

31:25.666 --> 31:28.147
But stand up and be a man.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.064
Or remain still
and I will end it now,

31:33.239 --> 31:34.283
so I can defend my family.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.024
Do it.

31:37.286 --> 31:38.984
Do it.

31:40.246 --> 31:41.900
Damn you,
what's it going to be?

31:51.735 --> 31:53.433
I wanna go back upstairs.

31:55.348 --> 31:56.915
Whatever they are...

31:59.352 --> 32:00.919
wherever they're from,

32:03.225 --> 32:04.444
we can't let them win.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.158
Minister!

33:20.389 --> 33:22.130
Stop!

33:22.261 --> 33:23.218
Don't! Don't! Stop!

33:29.398 --> 33:31.270
- What happened?
- She's in the tunnels!

33:31.400 --> 33:33.402
One of them!
She took the boards off!

33:35.100 --> 33:37.015
Dammit! Tell Dennison
to watch the barn!

33:37.841 --> 33:38.799
Shit!

33:46.459 --> 33:47.634
- Constable!
- What is it?

33:47.764 --> 33:48.896
One of them got
into the tunnels.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.202
She's headed
for the barn.

34:02.692 --> 34:03.824
Oh no.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.498
- Aw, shit.
- They'll find the tunnel.

34:38.511 --> 34:39.773
They're in the barn!

34:39.903 --> 34:42.123
We couldn't stop them.

34:42.254 --> 34:45.648
George, start barricading
the dining room with Burroughs.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.607
We'll pull back
and fight them there.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.913
Rebecca, get back to
the parlor, keep watch.

34:50.044 --> 34:51.393
I'll come for you there.

35:03.623 --> 35:07.670
- George, rest.

35:07.801 --> 35:09.237
I'll do this.

36:12.953 --> 36:14.215
Tell Father.

36:46.987 --> 36:48.336
I can hear them.

36:49.468 --> 36:50.512
They're in.

36:51.861 --> 36:53.559
Fall back to the dining room.

36:57.084 --> 36:58.433
It's to create confusion.

36:59.434 --> 37:00.566
Go, go, go!

37:06.876 --> 37:09.009
Close it!
Close the barrier!

38:37.140 --> 38:38.707
They're everywhere!

38:38.838 --> 38:40.143
You can't leave the kitchen!

38:40.274 --> 38:42.494
- Honor!
- I'll go with her.

38:42.624 --> 38:43.625
Where's Tane?

38:45.584 --> 38:47.194
He's not with you?

38:47.325 --> 38:49.152
I sent him to get you when
I heard people in the walls.

38:49.283 --> 38:50.458
They're on the stairs.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.723
I'll find him! Go!

39:47.776 --> 39:48.864
Tane.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.174
Come with me.

39:54.304 --> 39:56.698
Tane? Now.

39:58.134 --> 40:00.006
Are you gonna hurt me?

40:00.136 --> 40:02.008
No.

40:02.138 --> 40:03.575
But they will.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.541
I'm gonna have
to find my boy!

40:20.026 --> 40:21.549
- Close the barricade behind me.
- Okay.

40:21.680 --> 40:22.594
Don't do it.

40:22.724 --> 40:24.683
I need to find my son.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.554
No, they're trying
to draw you out.

40:26.685 --> 40:28.948
Stick with the plan.

40:45.051 --> 40:46.661
Oh, no.

40:56.366 --> 40:57.585
No.

41:12.861 --> 41:14.733
I'm coming for you, demon.

41:15.821 --> 41:17.431
I'll have your head.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.135
Oh, no!

41:26.266 --> 41:27.920
They're in the cellar!
They've got the book!

41:33.360 --> 41:34.317
Father!

41:34.448 --> 41:36.015
Stay back!
Don't move!

41:43.718 --> 41:45.328
It can't be.

41:45.459 --> 41:46.982
Is it really you?

41:47.113 --> 41:48.288
Step aside!

41:58.080 --> 41:59.995
- Father!

42:51.351 --> 42:52.787
Honor, Honor, Honor.

42:52.918 --> 42:54.441
- It's all right.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.052
Rebecca,
take this downstairs.

42:58.837 --> 43:00.795
Go! Help Dennison.

43:02.928 --> 43:04.930
Honor,
are you all right?

43:05.060 --> 43:07.454
- I am.
- Come, help me with this.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.891
Help me with this.
Block the door.

43:18.334 --> 43:19.771
Tane?

43:19.901 --> 43:21.076
I don't know.

43:22.295 --> 43:23.731
Secure this.

43:30.912 --> 43:32.610
You're all going
to die here.

43:35.395 --> 43:36.788
There's no escape.

43:38.224 --> 43:39.225
Tane?

43:39.355 --> 43:40.487
Tane?

43:40.618 --> 43:43.142
Tane?
Is Tane down here?

43:43.272 --> 43:44.360
I don't think so.

43:44.491 --> 43:45.971
I'm coming.

44:02.204 --> 44:03.205
Charles.

44:07.253 --> 44:09.211
What are we doing?

44:09.342 --> 44:10.691
Fire at will.

44:12.388 --> 44:14.869
Charles.
You need to see this.

44:22.311 --> 44:23.138
No.

44:29.449 --> 44:32.017
You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.

44:32.147 --> 44:34.672
Father! Father!

44:35.455 --> 44:36.761
Honor?

44:41.417 --> 44:43.115
Father!

44:43.245 --> 44:44.507
- Son!

44:44.638 --> 44:47.206
Ah! I can't hold it! Ah!

44:47.336 --> 44:48.337
They're coming
over the barricade!

44:48.468 --> 44:49.861
Into the cellar!

44:49.991 --> 44:51.689
Everyone! Now!

45:15.538 --> 45:17.845
Come say your prayers.
Say your prayers.

45:19.455 --> 45:21.501
Christ in quiet,
Christ in danger,

45:21.631 --> 45:23.285
Christ in mouth of friend
and stranger.

45:23.416 --> 45:25.157
Christ beneath me,
Christ above me,

45:25.287 --> 45:27.072
Christ in hearts of
all that love me.

45:27.202 --> 45:29.204
Christ behind me,
Christ before me,

45:29.335 --> 45:31.119
Christ to comfort
and restore me.

45:31.250 --> 45:32.468
Christ in quiet,
Christ in danger,

45:32.599 --> 45:33.600
Christ in mouth of friend...

45:33.731 --> 45:34.949
They're comin' through!

45:35.080 --> 45:35.994
Christ behind me,

45:36.124 --> 45:37.473
Christ to comfort
and restore me.

45:37.604 --> 45:39.345
Hold back, Minister!

45:39.475 --> 45:41.913
Christ behind me,
Christ before me,

45:42.043 --> 45:44.002
Christ to comfort
and restore me.

45:44.132 --> 45:46.047
Christ in quiet,
Christ in danger,

45:46.178 --> 45:48.093
Christ in mouth
of friend and stranger.

45:48.223 --> 45:49.834
- They're coming through!
- Get ready!

45:56.362 --> 45:57.145
Charles!

46:25.043 --> 46:26.522
What's happening?

46:26.653 --> 46:28.089
They're leaving.

46:29.525 --> 46:30.613
Why?

46:30.744 --> 46:32.659
Why would they do that?

46:32.790 --> 46:34.487
I had to do it, Father.

46:34.617 --> 46:37.098
She said it would
make them stop.

46:37.229 --> 46:38.883
What?

46:39.013 --> 46:40.885
Tane, who said that?

46:41.015 --> 46:42.190
Make what stop?

46:42.321 --> 46:43.801
Loa.

46:45.454 --> 46:46.934
I gave her the book.

46:48.414 --> 46:50.851
Son... No!

46:50.982 --> 46:53.462
No! No!

46:59.207 --> 47:01.209
It was the only way
to stop them!

47:01.340 --> 47:03.298
She wanted to save us!
I'm sorry!

47:16.746 --> 47:18.096
Loa!

47:19.749 --> 47:21.142
Loa!

47:29.237 --> 47:30.151
Loa!
