00:02.170 --> 00:03.204
>> JIMMY: My frame of reference

00:03.237 --> 00:04.972
for love has always come from

00:05.005 --> 00:07.007
literature.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.243
In my brooding youth, Brontë

00:09.277 --> 00:11.212
encapsulated my viewpoint

00:11.245 --> 00:13.214
thusly: "The trouble is not that

00:13.247 --> 00:15.149
I am single and likely to stay

00:15.183 --> 00:16.984
single, but that I am lonely and

00:17.017 --> 00:19.587
likely to stay lonely."

00:19.620 --> 00:21.655
But as I grew up, my darkening

00:21.689 --> 00:23.591
view was more Shakespeare:

00:23.624 --> 00:26.327
"Love is merely a madness and I

00:26.360 --> 00:28.062
tell you, deserves as well a

00:28.096 --> 00:29.697
dark house and a whip as

00:29.730 --> 00:31.499
madmen do."

00:31.532 --> 00:33.667
But now...

00:33.701 --> 00:35.103
now...

00:35.136 --> 00:36.737
since you...

00:36.770 --> 00:38.706
to my abject horror, my view on

00:38.739 --> 00:40.408
love can be best described by

00:40.441 --> 00:43.277
Nicholas Sparks in The Notebook:

00:43.311 --> 00:45.446
"It's not easy...

00:45.479 --> 00:47.415
it's hard...

00:47.448 --> 00:48.716
and you have to work at it,

00:48.749 --> 00:50.518
but it's worth it...

00:50.551 --> 00:54.122
because I want you...

00:54.155 --> 00:57.425
I want all of you...

00:57.458 --> 00:59.293
forever."

00:59.327 --> 01:01.629
Or something like that.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.274
>> BECCA: No.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.758
>> * I'm gonna leave you anyway

01:30.791 --> 01:33.060
I'm gonna leave you anyway

01:33.093 --> 01:35.263
Gonna leave you anyway. *

01:41.869 --> 01:42.670
>> SAM: * I'm here

01:42.703 --> 01:43.504
>> SHITSTAIN: Uh... uh... uh.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.405
>> SAM: * I think I saw a deer

01:44.438 --> 01:45.038
>> HONEY NUTZ: What?

01:45.072 --> 01:45.473
>> SAM: * I'm about to kill

01:45.506 --> 01:45.973
the deer

01:46.006 --> 01:46.540
And get some meat *

01:46.574 --> 01:47.241
>> SHITSTAIN: Uh... uh.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.108
>> SAM: * 'Cause I'm hungry.

01:48.142 --> 01:48.842
Everybody talking 'bout they

01:48.876 --> 01:49.343
homies *

01:49.377 --> 01:50.178
>> SHITSTAIN: What?

01:50.211 --> 01:51.745
>> SAM: * My chain bling, bling!

01:51.779 --> 01:52.846
Now these girls owe me... *

01:52.880 --> 01:53.781
(both sniffling, sighing)

01:53.814 --> 01:54.748
>> LINDSAY: Tomorrow...

01:54.782 --> 01:55.816
we meet with the flower guy...

01:55.849 --> 01:57.585
then we're tasting cakes,

01:57.618 --> 01:59.320
and then me and, uh...

01:59.353 --> 02:00.354
Ugh...!

02:00.388 --> 02:01.589
>> GRETCHEN: You don't know your

02:01.622 --> 02:02.590
fiancé's name?

02:02.623 --> 02:04.091
>> LINDSAY (laughs): Of course I

02:04.124 --> 02:06.327
know his... don't be dumb.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.861
Paul!

02:07.895 --> 02:08.862
I'm just wired!

02:08.896 --> 02:09.663
>> GRETCHEN: Call it off.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.299
>> LINDSAY: No way!

02:11.332 --> 02:12.333
You should've seen Becca's dumb

02:12.366 --> 02:13.601
face when I told her I was

02:13.634 --> 02:14.602
getting married before her, and

02:14.635 --> 02:15.503
Mom has never paid me so much

02:15.536 --> 02:17.771
attention.

02:17.805 --> 02:18.772
I should've gotten married when

02:18.806 --> 02:19.473
I was 12.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.208
>> GRETCHEN: All right, you have

02:20.241 --> 02:20.874
to promise me something--

02:20.908 --> 02:23.143
cross your tits, hope to die--

02:23.177 --> 02:24.545
that even though you're getting

02:24.578 --> 02:26.880
m-m... married...

02:26.914 --> 02:28.216
we are gonna keep this party

02:28.249 --> 02:29.717
going, right?

02:29.750 --> 02:31.352
'Cause this is how this starts.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.453
First, you get married, then you

02:32.486 --> 02:33.521
get some bullshit job, then you

02:33.554 --> 02:35.456
have kids and then you die.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.291
But what you don't know...

02:37.325 --> 02:38.492
is that you were dead the entire

02:38.526 --> 02:39.727
time.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.794
>> LINDSAY: I'm on a lot of

02:40.828 --> 02:41.795
drugs right now.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.163
Can you not tell me I'm dead?

02:43.197 --> 02:44.232
I promise!

02:44.265 --> 02:46.567
I got to go pee.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.503
>> SAM (sighs): Ah...

02:49.537 --> 02:50.671
How was it?

02:50.704 --> 02:51.639
>> ENGINEER: Oh, dope, Sam.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.640
>> SAM: Not you, bitch.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.641
>> ENGINEER: Oh.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.808
>> SAM: You, bitch!

02:54.842 --> 02:55.643
>> GRETCHEN: What?

02:55.676 --> 02:56.644
Oh, me?

02:56.677 --> 02:57.478
No...

02:57.511 --> 02:58.346
I'm just Rick's shitty

02:58.379 --> 02:59.313
assistant.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.314
>> SAM: That Harvey

03:00.348 --> 03:02.416
Weinstein-on-antibiotics

03:02.450 --> 03:03.884
lookin' nerd couldn't be

03:03.917 --> 03:05.219
bothered to attend the final mix

03:05.253 --> 03:06.687
of my first major album?!

03:06.720 --> 03:08.389
>> GRETCHEN: He sent muffins.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.728
Hey, can I ask you guys

03:14.762 --> 03:15.663
something?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.331
Is...

03:17.365 --> 03:19.267
that how you normally dress?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.268
>> SHITSTAIN: What, like, in our

03:20.301 --> 03:21.435
regular lives?

03:21.469 --> 03:22.503
Like when we go to the farmer's

03:22.536 --> 03:23.504
market?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.572
>> HONEY NUTZ: Uh... Rick

03:24.605 --> 03:25.573
suggested that we cultivate

03:25.606 --> 03:26.940
a street-look.

03:26.974 --> 03:27.841
>> GRETCHEN: What do you usually

03:27.875 --> 03:28.942
look like?

03:28.976 --> 03:29.943
>> SAM: Annoying, white, skater

03:29.977 --> 03:31.545
kids from Venice at a rave.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.381
>> GRETCHEN: Well, then...

03:33.414 --> 03:34.782
I don't know, maybe dress like

03:34.815 --> 03:37.285
that.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.555
>> SAM: Tell Rick he's fired.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.756
You're our new publicist.

03:42.790 --> 03:43.857
>> GRETCHEN: What, me?

03:43.891 --> 03:46.627
N-No... I'm not a... (laughing)

03:46.660 --> 03:48.296
I'm not looking for a real job.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.363
>> SAM: Tough shit, bitch!

03:49.397 --> 03:51.732
You in it now.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.372
>> STEEB: I'm speaking with

03:58.406 --> 04:01.942
Jimmy Shive-Overly about his...

04:01.975 --> 04:03.911
pugnacious debut novel,

04:03.944 --> 04:07.315
Congratulations, You're Dying.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.248
Tell us about your writing

04:08.282 --> 04:09.717
process.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.218
>> JIMMY: Rage, heartbreak...

04:11.251 --> 04:12.620
alcohol.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.721
>> STEEB: Heartbreak?

04:13.754 --> 04:14.822
>> JIMMY: I woke up one day and

04:14.855 --> 04:17.391
found myself happy.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.559
It was awful.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.593
>> STEEB: Mm...

04:19.627 --> 04:20.894
Elucidate, please.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.496
>> JIMMY: The lass eviscerated

04:22.530 --> 04:24.832
me, as lasses are wont to do.

04:24.865 --> 04:25.733
That was about a year

04:25.766 --> 04:26.834
and a half ago.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.502
Best thing she ever could have

04:28.536 --> 04:29.570
done for me.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.438
>> STEEB: The book?

04:30.471 --> 04:31.472
>> JIMMY: Yeah...

04:31.505 --> 04:32.606
'Twas a result of that

04:32.640 --> 04:33.807
disemboweling.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.576
It was then I learned the

04:35.609 --> 04:36.777
truth of my writing.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.678
I suck when I'm happy.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.812
>> STEEB: Mmm!

04:38.846 --> 04:39.847
You have to be miserable to

04:39.880 --> 04:40.848
produce?

04:40.881 --> 04:41.915
>> JIMMY: Oh, I wouldn't say,

04:41.949 --> 04:42.783
"miserable," but I'd say

04:42.816 --> 04:45.519
constant horror and bone-deep

04:45.553 --> 04:47.421
dissatisfaction is helpful.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.856
Yeah.

04:48.889 --> 04:49.690
>> STEEB: You're listening to

04:49.723 --> 04:50.758
Folio.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.992
I'm your host, Steeb

04:52.025 --> 04:53.627
Corniglia, here with the

04:53.661 --> 04:57.665
puissant Jimmy Shive-Overly.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.700
Jimmy, it seems to me endemic in

04:59.733 --> 05:02.269
your work that the parental

05:02.302 --> 05:04.372
characters obfuscate by playing

05:04.405 --> 05:07.441
almost prosaic arpeggios on the

05:07.475 --> 05:09.943
central motif.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.445
>> JIMMY: I'm glad you picked up

05:11.479 --> 05:12.513
on that.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.815
>> STEEB: Mmm...

05:18.486 --> 05:19.620
>> EDGAR: How scary is America

05:19.653 --> 05:22.423
now... bitch?!

05:30.664 --> 05:32.299
Jimmy!

05:32.332 --> 05:33.567
Jimmy?

05:33.601 --> 05:34.468
>> JIMMY: I don't have any

05:34.502 --> 05:35.569
change, I don't have any change!

05:35.603 --> 05:36.704
>> EDGAR: What?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.672
No.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.341
It's Edgar.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.342
>> JIMMY: I used to buy weed

05:42.376 --> 05:43.377
from you.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.912
>> EDGAR: That's me.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.814
>> JIMMY: Get off me!

05:46.847 --> 05:48.048
>> EDGAR: How's it going?

05:48.081 --> 05:49.483
>> JIMMY: Yeah, great.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.551
I just got done doing a, uh,

05:50.584 --> 05:52.520
radio show about my new novel.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.354
>> EDGAR: That's awesome.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.756
I'm happy for you.

05:55.789 --> 05:56.990
>> JIMMY: Thanks.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.091
>> EDGAR: Yeah.

05:58.125 --> 05:58.892
>> JIMMY: You don't look so

05:58.926 --> 05:59.860
good.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.362
Here, I got something for you.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.899
Free of charge.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.402
I'll even sign it.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.705
So what's the latest?

06:11.739 --> 06:12.773
>> EDGAR: Actually, I got home

06:12.806 --> 06:13.941
from Iraq and things have

06:13.974 --> 06:15.676
been...

06:15.709 --> 06:17.010
sort of hard, in terms of

06:17.044 --> 06:18.846
adjusting.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.013
And homelessness.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.682
>> JIMMY: Well, hey, if things

06:21.715 --> 06:23.016
ever get really dire, I've got

06:23.050 --> 06:24.518
this chaise on my deck, you

06:24.552 --> 06:25.519
could always sleep there for

06:25.553 --> 06:26.520
a night.

06:26.554 --> 06:27.421
>> EDGAR: Awesome.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.121
Could, sh-should we, sh-should

06:28.155 --> 06:29.056
we go now or...?

06:29.089 --> 06:30.023
>> JIMMY: Right, so if...

06:30.057 --> 06:31.892
things ever get really dire, the

06:31.925 --> 06:33.527
publisher's e-mail's in the back

06:33.561 --> 06:35.563
of the book.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.898
All right, bye.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.369
>> EDGAR: You son of a...

06:42.402 --> 06:44.672
bitch!

06:48.108 --> 06:50.611
(photographers clamoring)

07:00.521 --> 07:01.789
>> INTERVIEWER: Sam! Sam, Sam.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.123
Hey.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.492
You guys recorded a song for the

07:04.525 --> 07:05.926
soundtrack, correct?

07:05.959 --> 07:08.161
>> SAM: I don't know.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.730
Is it a song?

07:09.763 --> 07:10.798
>> INTERVIEWER: Right!

07:10.831 --> 07:11.899
Well, what do you make of the

07:11.932 --> 07:12.933
themes of the movie?

07:12.966 --> 07:14.067
I mean, it is at its heart

07:14.101 --> 07:15.435
a war movie.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.604
>> SAM: Oh.

07:16.637 --> 07:19.473
Is tha the theme...?

07:24.778 --> 07:26.747
>> INTERVIEWER: Thanks.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.781
>> GRETCHEN: The guys are so

07:27.815 --> 07:29.517
excited to have contributed to

07:29.550 --> 07:30.951
such an esteemed director's film

07:30.984 --> 07:32.152
and... you know where I'm going

07:32.185 --> 07:33.420
with this.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.455
Just finish the quote for me.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.490
(Ty clears throat)

07:36.524 --> 07:37.925
>> TY: Ty Wyland.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.459
The director.

07:39.493 --> 07:40.193
That you were just talking

07:40.227 --> 07:41.194
about.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.162
>> GRETCHEN: Where'd you get the

07:42.195 --> 07:42.763
drink?

07:42.796 --> 07:43.697
(Ty laughs wryly)

07:43.731 --> 07:45.098
>> TY: I'll show you if you

07:45.132 --> 07:46.099
agree to get dinner with me

07:46.133 --> 07:47.034
sometime.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.802
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah... dating's

07:48.836 --> 07:50.938
not really my thing.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.840
>> TY: Good. Me neither.

07:52.873 --> 07:53.807
So I'll call you in a couple

07:53.841 --> 07:55.643
weeks?

07:55.676 --> 07:56.710
Heading to India for a

07:56.744 --> 07:58.445
little bit.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.780
>> GRETCHEN: Okay.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.781
I warned you.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.083
>> TY: I'll call you.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.794
>> GRETCHEN: Listen, Nestor, I

08:13.827 --> 08:15.996
am flattered, but I've been kind

08:16.029 --> 08:17.898
of seeing someone for about a

08:17.931 --> 08:18.899
year now.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.500
I'm actually on my way to his

08:20.534 --> 08:21.802
house right now.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.804
So I won't be coming over to

08:23.837 --> 08:24.805
your hotel.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.239
But, trust me, the guys are

08:26.273 --> 08:28.241
over the moon about the photo

08:28.275 --> 08:29.810
shoot.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.145
You are their favorite

08:32.179 --> 08:34.815
photographer by miles.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.217
Mm-hmm.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.986
Ciao.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.888
(turns up volume)

08:40.921 --> 08:43.190
*

08:54.602 --> 08:55.135
(phone chimes)

08:55.168 --> 08:55.903
>> GRETCHEN: Seriously?

08:55.936 --> 08:57.170
Dude, I'm on my way to

08:57.204 --> 08:59.707
your house.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.851
Aw, shit.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.853
Shit!

09:12.886 --> 09:14.955
Shit.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.256
(dog barking in distance)

09:18.558 --> 09:20.894
(clanking, scraping)

09:33.073 --> 09:33.907
(indistinct police radio

09:33.941 --> 09:34.908
communication)

09:34.942 --> 09:36.076
>> GRETCHEN: Shit.

09:38.646 --> 09:39.880
>> JIMMY: It's been a year!

09:39.913 --> 09:41.982
Where the hell are my royalties?

09:42.015 --> 09:43.050
Because I need them to live off

09:43.083 --> 09:44.584
of.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.720
Yes, I know Junot Díaz writes

09:46.754 --> 09:48.221
for Esquir but I am a

09:48.255 --> 09:49.923
novelist.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.591
Yeah, I'm-I'm working on the

09:51.625 --> 09:53.093
follow-up, but it's-it's slow

09:53.126 --> 09:54.227
going and...

09:54.261 --> 09:56.664
I'll talk to you later.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.732
>> EDGAR: I'm nervous, Jimmy.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.567
I-I haven't been to a big social

10:00.600 --> 10:01.969
event since I've been back.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.236
Are you sure they know I'm

10:03.270 --> 10:04.237
coming?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.006
>> JIMMY: Yes. Get in.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.941
>> EDGAR: Are you sure... it's

10:07.975 --> 10:09.777
even a good idea that you go?

10:09.810 --> 10:10.778
>> JIMMY: What's the worst I

10:10.811 --> 10:11.779
could do?

10:11.812 --> 10:13.246
>> EDGAR: Okay. Fine.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.247
>> JIMMY: No, seriously, what is

10:14.281 --> 10:15.749
the worst I could do?

10:15.783 --> 10:16.750
I've been up all night working

10:16.784 --> 10:17.751
on my list of ways to ruin their

10:17.785 --> 10:18.752
wedding.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.120
I keep getting stuck around

10:20.153 --> 10:22.122
"Seduce the groom's mother."

10:24.792 --> 10:26.326
>> KILLIAN: Hi, new neighbors!

10:26.359 --> 10:27.828
Hi!

10:27.861 --> 10:30.130
Hello!

10:40.808 --> 10:42.009
>> LINDSAY: Were the other jail

10:42.042 --> 10:43.777
girls mean?

10:43.811 --> 10:45.112
Did any of them try to make out

10:45.145 --> 10:46.113
with you?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.614
>> GRETCHEN: No.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.949
But one girl kept some pretty

10:48.982 --> 10:50.150
strong eye contact with me while

10:50.183 --> 10:52.119
she was on the toilet.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.286
>> PAUL: Well, we should

10:53.320 --> 10:54.722
vámonos, señoritas.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.723
>> GRETCHEN: What'd you get

10:55.756 --> 10:56.724
them, anyway?

10:56.757 --> 10:58.125
>> LINDSAY: A food processor.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.159
>> GRETCHEN: (scoffs) I don't

10:59.192 --> 11:00.861
get it.

11:00.894 --> 11:01.895
Why does everyone feel the need

11:01.929 --> 11:03.230
to have these things, these,

11:03.263 --> 11:05.799
like, symbols of adulthood?

11:05.833 --> 11:07.300
Like, a food processor?

11:07.334 --> 11:08.902
Why do you need this stuff?

11:08.936 --> 11:09.903
>> PAUL: That's an interesting

11:09.937 --> 11:10.904
question.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.807
I think, maybe, it means you're

11:13.841 --> 11:15.809
investing in your future.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.177
You may not use it every day or

11:17.210 --> 11:19.646
even very often at all, but

11:19.679 --> 11:22.049
knowing that at any moment you

11:22.082 --> 11:25.018
could make pesto without having

11:25.052 --> 11:26.653
to borrow a friend's or

11:26.686 --> 11:29.322
improvise some lesser method,

11:29.356 --> 11:30.924
that knowledge, that

11:30.958 --> 11:34.327
possibility, makes you an adult.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.329
>> LINDSAY: Plus, this one,

11:36.363 --> 11:37.397
it's, like, one level worse than

11:37.430 --> 11:38.932
ours, so Becca can never beat

11:38.966 --> 11:40.167
me.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.435
Bitch.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.104
*

11:44.137 --> 11:46.673
>> MAN: * Mm-hmm, hmm, hmm

11:46.706 --> 11:48.708
Yeah

11:48.742 --> 11:50.343
Aw, yeah... *

11:50.377 --> 11:51.344
>> WEDDING COORDINATOR: I'm

11:51.378 --> 11:52.345
sorry, Jimmy.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.346
You didn't include a name for

11:53.380 --> 11:54.347
your plus-one so we didn't hold

11:54.381 --> 11:55.348
the space.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.416
>> EDGAR: Jim-Jim...

11:56.449 --> 11:57.851
Um, I-I could help serve food

11:57.885 --> 11:58.852
or...

11:58.886 --> 11:59.853
>> JIMMY: I put in two years

11:59.887 --> 12:01.454
penetrating the bride at least

12:01.488 --> 12:03.390
thrice weekly.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.925
I deserve to have a friend here.

12:04.958 --> 12:05.926
>> WEDDING COORDINATOR: I'll see

12:05.959 --> 12:08.261
what I can do.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.067
>> PAUL: Hey, Jimmy.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.236
>> JIMMY: Sorry, have we met?

12:16.269 --> 12:17.871
>> PAUL: Okay.

12:17.905 --> 12:18.906
I get it.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.040
Shut the door on the former

12:20.073 --> 12:21.208
life.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.442
I think it's very brave of you

12:22.475 --> 12:23.476
to have come.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.946
>> JIMMY: Mmm. Thanks.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.281
You.

12:33.854 --> 12:34.721
>> WEDDING COORDINATOR: Okay,

12:34.754 --> 12:35.823
I found you a seat.

12:35.856 --> 12:36.824
>> GRETCHEN: One day all my

12:36.857 --> 12:38.491
L.A. friends were married, with

12:38.525 --> 12:41.061
houses and adult jobs,

12:41.094 --> 12:42.162
Instagramming every time they

12:42.195 --> 12:43.763
went to the ArcLight.

12:43.797 --> 12:44.798
So, basically, there's nothing

12:44.832 --> 12:45.799
keeping me here.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.800
And I figured if I want to move

12:46.834 --> 12:48.135
to New York, where I still have

12:48.168 --> 12:49.236
friends who aren't collecting

12:49.269 --> 12:50.770
their eggs in petri dishes,

12:50.804 --> 12:51.771
why not?

12:51.805 --> 12:52.772
>> BARTENDER: So you don't want

12:52.806 --> 12:53.773
the drink?

12:53.807 --> 12:54.908
>> GRETCHEN: So I am moving

12:54.942 --> 12:56.243
tomorrow.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.945
To New York.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.079
I'm not even gonna say good-bye

12:59.112 --> 13:00.080
to anyone.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.081
I hate good-byes.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.082
>> BARTENDER: Leaving a whole

13:02.115 --> 13:03.250
city Irish, huh?

13:03.283 --> 13:04.918
That's hard-core.

13:04.952 --> 13:05.986
>> GRETCHEN: Hey, what do you

13:06.019 --> 13:07.020
think a nice food processor goes

13:07.054 --> 13:08.021
for?

13:08.055 --> 13:09.022
>> BARTENDER: I don't know.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.157
400, 500 bucks?

13:10.190 --> 13:11.491
>> GRETCHEN: Seriously?

13:11.524 --> 13:13.994
Sweet.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.102
>> EDGAR: So, uh, are you all...

13:22.135 --> 13:23.103
you all gonna have the nuggets

13:23.136 --> 13:24.771
or-or the mac and cheese?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.773
I can't decide.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.941
(clears throat)

13:27.975 --> 13:29.843
So, what do you do?

13:29.877 --> 13:31.778
>> GIRL: I'm a child.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.346
>> EDGAR: Cool.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.116
Are we getting together after

13:36.149 --> 13:37.317
or...

13:37.350 --> 13:39.853
Cheers.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.460
>> JIMMY: No, you're right.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.461
This day isn't about me, is it?

13:48.495 --> 13:49.462
>> BECCA: What were you gonna

13:49.496 --> 13:50.463
say?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.464
>> JIMMY: Forget it.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.000
>> BECCA: No, I'm serious.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.467
I really want to know what does

13:54.501 --> 13:56.136
the brilliant Jimmy

13:56.169 --> 13:58.105
Shive-Overly think about me!

14:00.340 --> 14:01.408
(anxious laugh)

14:01.441 --> 14:02.409
>> JIMMY: I'm not one for

14:02.442 --> 14:04.144
psychic thought or oracles, but,

14:04.177 --> 14:06.313
Rebecca...

14:06.346 --> 14:07.480
(quietly): you and I have not

14:07.514 --> 14:09.349
made love for the last time.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.922
>> VERNON: Hey!

14:14.955 --> 14:18.025
(Becca crying)

14:18.058 --> 14:20.827
>> PAUL: ...and, Vernon, to

14:20.860 --> 14:22.996
you, I just want to say,

14:23.030 --> 14:24.998
"Welcome to the family.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.866
It gets better."

14:26.900 --> 14:27.867
>> VERNON: (chuckles) What a

14:27.901 --> 14:29.069
dork.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.070
>> BECCA: I can't believe it

14:30.103 --> 14:31.071
took them two months to edit our

14:31.104 --> 14:32.072
wedding video.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.073
>> VERNON: Dave did it for free.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.074
>> BECCA: Yeah, well, you get

14:34.107 --> 14:35.075
what you pay for.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.409
Oh, I talked to Aunt Helen.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.410
She insists she got us a

14:37.444 --> 14:38.411
blender.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.412
You don't have to get us a

14:39.446 --> 14:40.413
wedding gift, but don't lie

14:40.447 --> 14:41.614
about it.

14:41.648 --> 14:42.882
>> LINDSAY: Um, anyway, I love

14:42.916 --> 14:43.883
you so much.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.119
And, remember, there is no shame

14:46.153 --> 14:48.355
whatsoever in getting married

14:48.388 --> 14:49.556
two years after your little

14:49.589 --> 14:51.024
sister.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.025
Siblings mature at different

14:52.059 --> 14:53.026
rates.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.227
(Vernon laughs)

14:54.261 --> 14:55.228
>> BECCA: What a cooze.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.429
>> VERNON: Paul, did you hear?

14:56.463 --> 14:57.464
Jimmy took a photo of his dingus

14:57.497 --> 14:58.465
on every one of our disposable

14:58.498 --> 14:59.466
cameras.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.467
>> PAUL: Seriously?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.468
>> VERNON: Yeah.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.869
What a classic heckle.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.937
Becca recognized it on account

15:03.971 --> 15:05.272
of it having been in her mouth

15:05.305 --> 15:07.607
so much.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.044
>> PAUL: Did you hear?

15:11.078 --> 15:12.045
They broke up.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.046
>> VERNON: Who?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.047
Jimmy and Gretchen? No.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.048
>> BECCA: What?

15:15.082 --> 15:16.049
>> PAUL: Yeah.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.650
Gretchen's really upset.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.120
I can't say I'm that surprised.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.321
They're both quite spirited.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.389
>> VERNON: Wow.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.623
That's a bummer.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.992
I should call him.

15:25.025 --> 15:25.993
He's probably waiting to hear

15:26.026 --> 15:26.994
from me.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.261
Let me get one of those?

15:28.295 --> 15:29.262
>> BECCA: These are pretty

15:29.296 --> 15:31.598
expensive.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.011
>> JIMMY: Superman is aware that

15:44.044 --> 15:46.146
kryptonite is his kryptonite,

15:46.179 --> 15:47.180
and he keeps getting mixed up

15:47.214 --> 15:48.515
with it anyway.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.583
Women, romantic happiness, is my

15:50.617 --> 15:52.419
kryptonite.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.320
I got complacent being with

15:53.353 --> 15:54.121
Becca and produced shit-all.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.022
And the minute she left me

15:55.055 --> 15:56.423
twisting up on that hill with

15:56.456 --> 15:57.590
that ring--

15:57.624 --> 15:59.592
Bam, the book came to me.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.094
Whole cloth.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.096
And then-- then I did it again.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.098
At that selfsame succubi's

16:05.132 --> 16:07.100
wedding, no less.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.701
And, no doubt, my work suffered

16:08.735 --> 16:10.037
being with Gretchen.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.972
And now, having broken up with

16:13.006 --> 16:14.941
her is guaranteed to release

16:14.974 --> 16:16.109
the words.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.644
In fact, I can feel all my

16:17.677 --> 16:20.213
creative juices returning to me

16:20.247 --> 16:22.615
already.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.950
I wouldn't be surprised if I

16:23.983 --> 16:25.652
started playing guitar again.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.220
Nope.

16:27.254 --> 16:30.357
Would not be surprised at all.

16:30.390 --> 16:34.127
Cheers, mate.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.628
This is normally where you make

16:35.662 --> 16:37.364
a weird non sequitur and I

16:37.397 --> 16:38.365
chastise you and continue

16:38.398 --> 16:39.366
talking.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.367
>> EDGAR: Yeah, well, with

16:40.400 --> 16:41.501
Gretchen, you've been actually

16:41.534 --> 16:42.969
kind of fun to be around, but

16:43.002 --> 16:44.337
if you're telling me that we're

16:44.371 --> 16:45.638
going back to you being a

16:45.672 --> 16:47.507
hundred percent dick so that you

16:47.540 --> 16:48.741
can write another stupid book I

16:48.775 --> 16:49.742
won't read?

16:49.776 --> 16:51.078
(scoffs) Uh-uh.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.079
Unsubscribe.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.080
>> JIMMY: Whoa, what are you

16:53.113 --> 16:54.081
doing?

16:54.114 --> 16:55.082
You never pay for drinks.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.083
>> EDGAR: I'm done owing you

16:56.116 --> 16:57.084
stuff, Jimmy.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.085
>> JIMMY: Oh, sit down, man.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.086
>> EDGAR: Don't tell me what to

16:59.119 --> 17:00.087
do.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.254
You don't get to tell me what to

17:01.288 --> 17:03.523
do anymore!

17:03.556 --> 17:04.524
>> JIMMY: It's PTSD.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.525
He's all right, he's fine.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.526
>> EDGAR: You know that night

17:06.559 --> 17:07.694
you met Gretchen?

17:07.727 --> 17:09.396
Do you remember how nervous I

17:09.429 --> 17:12.165
was to go to Becca's wedding?

17:12.199 --> 17:14.667
How crowds freak me out?

17:14.701 --> 17:15.668
>> JIMMY: That was a lifetime

17:15.702 --> 17:16.669
ago.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.505
>> EDGAR: It was two months ago.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.407
You brought me as a prop

17:20.440 --> 17:22.709
and then forgot about me.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.044
I had to sit with a bunch of

17:25.078 --> 17:26.379
very condescending and

17:26.413 --> 17:27.514
unfriendly children who wouldn't

17:27.547 --> 17:29.216
even invite me to the after

17:29.249 --> 17:31.384
party.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.253
I'm going to get my stuff.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.287
I'll leave the keys on

17:34.321 --> 17:35.288
the table.

17:35.322 --> 17:40.760
>> JIMMY: Wait.

17:40.793 --> 17:41.761
You didn't read my book?

17:41.794 --> 17:43.396
>> EDGAR: No way.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.031
It looked crazy boring.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.700
>> JIMMY: Well, fine, go.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.302
You're only helping me.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.604
Now I'm even... even more alone.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.311
>> VERNON: Hey, I got something

17:58.345 --> 17:58.711
for you.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.412
>> PAUL: What?

17:59.446 --> 18:00.079
(farts)

18:00.113 --> 18:00.713
>> PAUL: Oh!

18:00.747 --> 18:01.548
>> VERNON: That's for you.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.649
It's a gift, straight from the

18:02.682 --> 18:04.651
heart.

18:09.656 --> 18:12.492
>> PAUL: Ugh.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.494
(car door shuts, engine starts)

18:16.163 --> 18:19.098
>> VERNON: She left. Huh.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.400
Bitches be trippin'.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.401
Speaking of bitches, where'd you

18:21.434 --> 18:22.402
say Lindsay was?

18:22.435 --> 18:23.403
>> PAUL: Comforting Gretchen

18:23.436 --> 18:25.104
after the breakup.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.105
Still.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.340
>> VERNON: Sweet.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.408
Let's bust open some scotch and

18:28.441 --> 18:29.409
get dumb.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.810
>> PAUL: I really shouldn't.

18:30.843 --> 18:31.811
And didn't you say you have

18:31.844 --> 18:32.812
surgery in the morning?

18:32.845 --> 18:33.813
>> VERNON: Come on, Paul.

18:33.846 --> 18:34.814
Don't be such a fa...

18:34.847 --> 18:35.815
>> SAM: * Part scorpion

18:35.848 --> 18:36.683
>> SINGERS: * Uh-huh

18:36.716 --> 18:37.684
>> SAM: * Part accordion

18:37.717 --> 18:38.585
>> SINGERS: * Uh-huh

18:38.618 --> 18:39.586
>> SAM: * Lord, according to Tom

18:39.619 --> 18:40.587
Ford, I'm born again *

18:40.620 --> 18:41.521
(Honey Nutz and Shitstain whoop)

18:41.554 --> 18:42.522
>> SAM: * I'm a cash box

18:42.555 --> 18:43.523
drippin' full of fives and tens

18:43.556 --> 18:44.424
I'm the sarcophagus, the

18:44.457 --> 18:45.425
parasite, so put me in *

18:45.458 --> 18:46.259
>> SHITSTAIN: Let's go!

18:46.293 --> 18:47.260
>> HONEY NUTZ: * You in the

18:47.294 --> 18:48.661
Thunderdome, son, with the young

18:48.695 --> 18:50.430
one writin' a blank check like

18:50.463 --> 18:51.598
* If my name was Young Gun

18:51.631 --> 18:52.599
>> SHITSTAIN: * Pass the iced

18:52.632 --> 18:55.101
tea, I'm parched, Middlemarch,

18:55.134 --> 18:56.102
cookie fart, false start,

18:56.135 --> 18:57.270
all parched... *

18:57.304 --> 18:58.271
(whoops)

18:58.305 --> 18:59.439
(both snorting)

18:59.472 --> 19:00.773
>> LINDSAY: Marriage is such

19:00.807 --> 19:02.275
bullshit.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.510
Why didn't you warn me?

19:03.543 --> 19:04.511
>> GRETCHEN: The morning of your

19:04.544 --> 19:06.379
wedding, I said, "Lindsay, don't

19:06.413 --> 19:07.647
do this."

19:07.680 --> 19:09.816
>> LINDSAY: The girls are back.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.818
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, thank God.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.386
I never told you-- I was gonna

19:13.420 --> 19:14.387
move to New York after Becca's

19:14.421 --> 19:15.388
wedding.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.389
>> LINDSAY: What?

19:16.423 --> 19:17.390
>> GRETCHEN: Yeah.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.326
I was like, "Everyone's getting

19:19.359 --> 19:21.294
so serious about everything.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.295
Ooh, my marriage, my career,

19:22.329 --> 19:25.832
I have groceries."

19:25.865 --> 19:26.833
I was like, "Nothing's keeping

19:26.866 --> 19:29.135
me here, let's go."

19:29.168 --> 19:30.136
>> LINDSAY: Okay.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.571
>> GRETCHEN: Okay what?

19:31.604 --> 19:33.206
>> LINDSAY: Let's go.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.207
Let's go.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.308
Gretchen, nothing's keeping me

19:35.342 --> 19:36.309
here, either.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.310
>> GRETCHEN: Lindsay.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.545
>> LINDSAY: Think about it.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.847
We can do drugs and go to weird

19:40.880 --> 19:42.582
Puerto Rican dance halls and

19:42.615 --> 19:44.183
take so much New York dick that

19:44.217 --> 19:45.752
our pussies start talking like,

19:45.785 --> 19:47.320
(New York accent): "Oh, another

19:47.354 --> 19:48.655
one-- fuggedaboutit."

19:48.688 --> 19:49.656
But they won't forget about it,

19:49.689 --> 19:50.857
Gretch, because we're just that

19:50.890 --> 19:51.858
memorable.

19:51.891 --> 19:52.859
>> GRETCHEN: How much blow have

19:52.892 --> 19:53.860
you done?

19:53.893 --> 19:55.328
>> LINDSAY: Oh, my God, I'm so

19:55.362 --> 19:57.163
excited about this plan that I

19:57.196 --> 19:58.498
have to pee.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.401
(Sam whoops, laughs)

20:03.636 --> 20:05.738
>> SAM: Yo, what the hell are

20:05.772 --> 20:06.739
you doing?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.575
>> GRETCHEN: Partying, what?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.209
>> SAM: This is where we work.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.444
>> GRETCHEN: Come on.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.512
This is where you do drugs

20:12.545 --> 20:13.846
and make up nonsense into the

20:13.880 --> 20:15.882
mic.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.620
>> SAM: You know, you were

20:20.653 --> 20:22.522
actually a pretty good PR rep,

20:22.555 --> 20:23.756
there.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.359
But lately, your ass has been

20:26.393 --> 20:27.727
tragic.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.228
If Rick hadn't died in that

20:29.262 --> 20:31.398
Jet Ski accident, his ass would

20:31.431 --> 20:33.533
be replacing you right now.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.701
>> GRETCHEN: You do the same

20:34.734 --> 20:35.702
dumb stuff I do.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.470
>> SAM: Bitch, I am 21.

20:37.504 --> 20:40.239
You're 30.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.274
>> LINDSAY: Hey, dawgs.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.275
(giggles)

20:42.309 --> 20:43.276
Should we live in a studio in

20:43.310 --> 20:44.277
New York?

20:44.311 --> 20:45.545
If we bang the same guys, we

20:45.578 --> 20:46.546
only need one bed.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.915
Gretch, do coke off my titties.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.249
>> GRETCHEN: I... I'm gonna go

20:50.283 --> 20:51.250
home.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.552
>> LINDSAY: With who, Shitstain?

20:52.585 --> 20:53.920
'Cause I'll take the other one.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.389
>> GRETCHEN: No, alone.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.292
This feels like someone else.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.427
I don't know.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.661
I'm sorry.

21:01.694 --> 21:02.729
I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna

21:02.762 --> 21:03.730
take a shower and I'm gonna

21:03.763 --> 21:04.731
figure out what I'm gonna do

21:04.764 --> 21:05.732
with my life.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.933
Maybe you should, too.

21:06.966 --> 21:07.934
>> LINDSAY: Are you goddamn

21:07.967 --> 21:08.935
kidding me?

21:08.968 --> 21:11.804
You always give me shit for

21:11.838 --> 21:12.939
being married, and now I'm

21:12.972 --> 21:14.507
cheating on my husband and you

21:14.541 --> 21:15.508
bail?

21:15.542 --> 21:16.909
You always bail on me, and I'm

21:16.943 --> 21:18.511
sick of it.

21:18.545 --> 21:19.579
>> GRETCHEN: I can only help

21:19.612 --> 21:21.814
myself, Linds, sorry.

21:21.848 --> 21:22.982
>> LINDSAY: Fine!

21:23.015 --> 21:24.651
I don't need you!

21:24.684 --> 21:26.285
You watch!

21:28.355 --> 21:30.457
(inhaling)

21:31.858 --> 21:35.428
>> JIMMY: Come on.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.697
Shit.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.631
(knocking on door)

21:41.801 --> 21:43.703
>> BECCA: Well, you were right,

21:43.736 --> 21:44.704
Jimmy.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.473
Here I am.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.441
>> JIMMY: Sorry?

21:48.475 --> 21:49.609
>> BECCA: Your prediction.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.843
At the wedding.

21:50.877 --> 21:51.844
>> JIMMY: What are you talking

21:51.878 --> 21:54.447
about?

21:54.481 --> 21:55.615
>> BECCA: "You and I have not

21:55.648 --> 21:57.617
made love for the last time."

21:57.650 --> 21:58.718
>> JIMMY: Why would you say

21:58.751 --> 21:59.719
that?

21:59.752 --> 22:01.721
>> BECCA: No, you said that.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.789
At my wedding.

22:02.822 --> 22:03.890
>> JIMMY: I did?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.858
Well, that was quite a heckle.

22:05.892 --> 22:06.959
>> BECCA: Oh, shut up.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.027
Come on, let's go.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.629
>> JIMMY: Becca, please...

22:09.662 --> 22:10.697
What are you doing?

22:10.730 --> 22:11.798
>> BECCA: Is this a joke?

22:11.831 --> 22:14.333
Are you not gonna have sex

22:14.367 --> 22:15.334
with me?

22:15.368 --> 22:17.970
>> JIMMY: Becca, you're married.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.872
>> BECCA: Oh, my God.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.508
You are a sociopath.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.742
I should've known.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.644
I-Is my entire life just a game

22:24.677 --> 22:25.645
to you?

22:25.678 --> 22:26.646
>> JIMMY: Becca, please, why

22:26.679 --> 22:27.647
don't you just go home?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.915
Get some sleep.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.017
You look tired.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.019
>> BECCA: Oh, my God, are you...

22:34.521 --> 22:36.756
*

22:40.693 --> 22:42.829
(cat meows)

22:42.862 --> 22:45.364
(purring)

22:57.744 --> 22:58.745
(Jimmy blows air)

23:04.584 --> 23:07.754
>> JIMMY: * You and I...

23:07.787 --> 23:09.422
(humming)

23:09.456 --> 23:13.392
Something, fly...

23:13.426 --> 23:17.396
* Do, do, do

23:17.430 --> 23:20.399
With love for-for...

23:20.433 --> 23:23.069
Y-You
