00:06.850 --> 00:09.050
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

00:09.150 --> 00:12.450
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.

00:12.550 --> 00:14.650
The entire song
is a metaphor for big dicks.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.149
No, it ain't.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.450
It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.

00:19.450 --> 00:22.750
She's been fucked over a few times
and she meets a guy who's sensitive.

00:22.850 --> 00:26.150
Whoa. Timeout.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

00:26.150 --> 00:28.450
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

00:28.450 --> 00:33.050
"Like A Virgin" is not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.750
That's what "True Blue" is about.
No argument about that.

00:35.850 --> 00:39.750
- Which one is "True Blue"?
- It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

00:39.750 --> 00:43.250
I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops
shit, and I've heard of "True Blue."

00:43.250 --> 00:46.050
I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
All I asked is, how's it go?

00:46.150 --> 00:48.550
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

00:48.650 --> 00:51.050
Personally, I can do without her.

00:51.150 --> 00:53.250
I used to like her early stuff,
"Borderline"...

00:53.350 --> 00:56.250
but once she got off with that
"Papa, Don't Preach" phase, I tuned out.

00:56.350 --> 00:59.150
Hey, you guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.350
I was sayin' something.
What was it?

01:01.450 --> 01:04.750
Oh, Toby's that
little Chinese girl.

01:04.849 --> 01:07.450
- What was her last name?
- What's that?

01:07.550 --> 01:12.050
It's an old address book I found in
a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

01:12.150 --> 01:15.150
- What was that name?
- What the fuck was I talkin' about?

01:15.250 --> 01:17.450
You said "True Blue"
was about a guy--

01:17.550 --> 01:19.850
a sensitive girl
who meets a nice guy...

01:19.950 --> 01:22.450
but "Like A Virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.850
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

01:24.950 --> 01:27.850
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

01:27.850 --> 01:30.250
I'm talkin' morning, day,
night, afternoon...

01:30.350 --> 01:33.250
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick!

01:33.250 --> 01:35.450
- How many "dicks" is that?
- A lot.

01:35.550 --> 01:38.850
Then one day, she meets
this John Holmes motherfucker.

01:38.850 --> 01:42.550
It's like, "Whoa, baby." He's like
Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."

01:42.650 --> 01:46.150
He's diggin' tunnels.
Now she's gettin' serious dick action.

01:46.150 --> 01:50.650
She's feelin' somethin' she ain't
felt since forever: pain, pain.

01:50.750 --> 01:52.350
Chew? Toby Chew?

01:52.450 --> 01:54.650
It hurts. It hurts her.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.250
It shouldn't hurt her.
Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.950
But when this cat
fucks her, it hurts.

02:00.050 --> 02:03.150
It hurts just like it did
the first time.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.850
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine...

02:05.950 --> 02:08.050
what it was once like
to be a virgin.

02:08.150 --> 02:10.949
Hence, "Like A Virgin."

02:12.150 --> 02:13.650
Wong.

02:13.750 --> 02:17.850
-Give me that fuckin' thing.
-What in hell do you think you're doin'?

02:17.950 --> 02:21.050
I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.

02:21.050 --> 02:23.650
What do you mean, when we leave?
Give me it back now!

02:23.750 --> 02:27.650
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.

02:27.750 --> 02:30.650
"Toby. Toby?

02:30.650 --> 02:32.950
Toby? Toby Wong.

02:33.050 --> 02:35.150
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.

02:35.250 --> 02:38.150
Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan."

02:38.250 --> 02:40.750
I've got Madonna's big dick
comin' out of my left ear...

02:40.850 --> 02:44.750
and Toby the Jap-- I don't know what--
comin' out of my right.

02:44.750 --> 02:47.350
Give me that book.

02:47.450 --> 02:49.350
Are you gonna put it away?

02:49.450 --> 02:52.950
I'm gonna do whatever
the fuck I want with it.

02:53.050 --> 02:55.450
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.450
Hey, Joe,
want me to shoot this guy?

02:58.550 --> 02:59.450
Shit.

02:59.550 --> 03:03.550
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.

03:07.450 --> 03:10.650
You guys been listenin' to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend?

03:10.750 --> 03:12.650
Yeah. That's fuckin' great.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.550
- You believe the songs they're playin'?
- Know what I heard the other day?

03:15.650 --> 03:18.550
"Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat" by little
Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.

03:18.650 --> 03:21.150
I haven't heard that song since
I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

03:21.250 --> 03:24.850
When I was comin' down here, "The Night
the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.

03:24.950 --> 03:27.850
I ain't heard that song
since it was big.

03:27.950 --> 03:31.150
But when it was big, I must've heard it
a million-trillion fuckin' times.

03:31.150 --> 03:33.150
But this is the first time
I ever realized...

03:33.250 --> 03:36.050
that the girl singin' the song
is the one who shot Andy.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.650
You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

03:38.750 --> 03:42.650
- I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.
- They say that at the end of the song.

03:42.750 --> 03:46.150
I know, motherfucker. I just heard it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

03:48.350 --> 03:50.650
I must've zoned out
during that part before.

03:50.750 --> 03:50.750
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

03:50.750 --> 03:54.450
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

03:54.550 --> 03:56.950
You guys can get the tip.

03:56.950 --> 03:59.350
Should be about a buck apiece.

03:59.450 --> 04:02.650
And you, when I come back
I want my book.

04:02.650 --> 04:05.150
Sorry. It's my book now.

04:05.250 --> 04:09.250
Hey, I changed my mind.
Shoot this piece of shit, will ya?

04:13.650 --> 04:16.350
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.450
Come on, throw in a buck.

04:24.550 --> 04:26.150
I don't tip.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.950
- You don't tip?
- I don't believe in it.

04:29.050 --> 04:31.150
You don't believe in tipping?

04:31.250 --> 04:34.450
Do you know what these chicks make?
They make shit.

04:34.550 --> 04:37.250
If she don't make enough money,
she can quit.

04:38.450 --> 04:41.050
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.850
Let me get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

04:43.950 --> 04:46.650
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

04:46.750 --> 04:51.150
If they really put forth the effort,
I'll give 'em somethin' extra.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.750
But this tipping automatically,
it's for the birds.

04:55.350 --> 04:57.550
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doin' their job.

04:57.650 --> 04:59.550
- This girl was nice.
- She was okay.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.850
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

05:01.950 --> 05:04.550
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?

05:07.550 --> 05:10.150
I'd go over 12% for that.

05:10.250 --> 05:14.150
I ordered coffee, all right?
She's only filled my cup three times.

05:14.150 --> 05:16.150
I want it filled six times.

05:16.250 --> 05:19.450
Six times? Well, what if
she's too fuckin' busy?

05:19.550 --> 05:22.650
The words "too fuckin' busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.450
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,
but the last fuckin' thing you need's...

05:25.450 --> 05:26.950
another cup of coffee.

05:26.950 --> 05:31.350
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
They make minimum wage.

05:31.450 --> 05:33.550
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did...

05:33.650 --> 05:36.550
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tip-worthy.

05:36.550 --> 05:38.650
You don't care they're
countin' on your tips to live?

05:41.150 --> 05:43.150
You know what this is?

05:43.150 --> 05:45.950
The world's smallest violin,
playin' just for the waitresses.

05:46.050 --> 05:49.450
You don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.850
These people bust their ass.
This is a hard job.

05:52.950 --> 05:56.250
So's working at McDonald's,
but you don't feel the need to tip them.

05:56.350 --> 05:58.850
They're servin' you food,
but society says...

05:58.950 --> 06:02.750
"Don't tip these guys over here,
but tip these guys." That's bullshit.

06:02.850 --> 06:04.950
Waitressing is
the number-one occupation...

06:05.050 --> 06:07.750
for female non-college graduates
in this country.

06:07.850 --> 06:11.750
It's the one job basically
any woman can get and make a living on.

06:11.850 --> 06:13.850
The reason is
because of their tips.

06:15.150 --> 06:16.550
Fuck all that.

06:19.350 --> 06:22.050
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips.

06:22.050 --> 06:24.350
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.550
It would appear that waitresses
are one of the many groups...

06:26.550 --> 06:28.850
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.

06:28.950 --> 06:32.450
Show me a paper that says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

06:32.550 --> 06:35.150
I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.

06:35.250 --> 06:39.150
This non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.

06:39.150 --> 06:42.650
If you're expectin' me to help out with
the rent, you're in for a big surprise.

06:42.650 --> 06:44.650
He's convinced me.
Give me my dollar back.

06:44.650 --> 06:48.050
Hey. Leave the dollars there.

06:49.650 --> 06:52.650
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

06:52.750 --> 06:55.450
Wait a minute.
Who didn't throw in?

06:55.550 --> 06:58.250
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

06:58.350 --> 07:00.950
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

07:01.050 --> 07:02.950
He don't tip?

07:03.050 --> 07:04.950
- You don't tip?
- He don't believe in it.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.350
Shut up. What do you mean,
you don't believe in it?

07:08.450 --> 07:13.050
Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

07:13.150 --> 07:17.050
Since you bought breakfast, I'll put in.
But normally I would never do this.

07:19.150 --> 07:21.450
Never mind what you
normally would do.

07:21.550 --> 07:25.950
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else. Thank you.

07:27.950 --> 07:32.250
That was the Partridge Family's
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted?"...

07:32.250 --> 07:34.350
followed by Edison Lighthouse's...

07:34.450 --> 07:37.550
"Love Grows Where
My Rosemary Goes"...

07:37.650 --> 07:41.250
as K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend...

07:41.350 --> 07:43.950
just keeps on truckin'.

07:43.950 --> 07:44.450
just keeps on truckin'.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.450
I'm gonna die.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.450
I'm gonna die!

09:32.550 --> 09:35.450
Just hold on, buddy boy!

09:35.450 --> 09:37.150
I'm gonna die!

09:39.650 --> 09:42.550
- I'm sorry!
- Give me your hand.

09:42.550 --> 09:46.850
I can't believe she killed me, man!
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

09:46.950 --> 09:51.550
Hey, just cancel
that shit right now!

09:51.550 --> 09:55.450
You're hurt. You're hurt
real fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!

10:01.950 --> 10:04.850
All this blood's scarin'
the shit out of me, Larry!

10:04.950 --> 10:07.350
I'm gonna die!
I know it!

10:07.450 --> 10:10.550
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

10:12.650 --> 10:14.750
Are you a doctor?

10:14.850 --> 10:16.650
Are you a doctor?

10:16.750 --> 10:19.250
Answer me, please!
Are you a doctor?

10:21.150 --> 10:23.950
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

10:24.050 --> 10:27.050
So you admit you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

10:27.150 --> 10:31.750
If you're through givin' me your
amateur opinion, lie back and listen.

10:31.750 --> 10:35.250
I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous,
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...

10:35.250 --> 10:39.050
the doctor's gonna
fix you up and...

10:39.050 --> 10:41.350
you're gonna be okay.

10:41.450 --> 10:44.850
Now say it!
You're gonna be okay!

10:44.850 --> 10:46.350
Say it!

10:46.350 --> 10:49.250
You're gonna be okay!

10:49.250 --> 10:52.450
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!

10:52.450 --> 10:53.950
Oh, God!

10:53.950 --> 10:56.050
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

10:56.150 --> 10:57.750
Say it!

10:57.850 --> 10:59.950
Okay, Larry.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.950
Correct! Correct!

11:05.650 --> 11:07.650
I'm okay.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.950
Look where we are.

11:17.950 --> 11:20.650
Look where we are.

11:20.750 --> 11:24.550
She had a baby, man.
She had a baby!

11:24.650 --> 11:26.550
We're in a warehouse.

11:27.650 --> 11:30.950
Who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?

11:32.050 --> 11:34.850
Come on, who's a tough guy?

11:34.950 --> 11:37.750
Who's a tough guy?
You're a tough guy.

11:37.850 --> 11:39.750
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.950
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

11:47.950 --> 11:50.350
We made it. We made it.

11:50.450 --> 11:53.750
We fuckin' made it.
We have fuckin' made it.

11:55.850 --> 11:58.850
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.250
Look where we are.

12:04.150 --> 12:06.050
Hold on. Hold on.

12:07.350 --> 12:09.850
- Shit!
- Stop bangin' your head.

12:09.950 --> 12:12.350
You're gonna bang
a fuckin' hole in the floor.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.150
You don't wanna hurt
the fuckin' floor, do you?

12:17.550 --> 12:19.450
I can't do anything for you.

12:19.550 --> 12:21.950
But when Joe gets here...

12:22.050 --> 12:24.050
which should be any time now...

12:24.150 --> 12:27.250
he's gonna help you out,
he's gonna take care of you.

12:27.350 --> 12:29.750
We're gonna sit
and wait for Joe.

12:31.750 --> 12:35.250
- Who are we waitin' for?
- Joe.

12:39.650 --> 12:43.750
Larry, I'm fucking scared, man.

12:46.650 --> 12:49.550
Would you please hold me?

12:49.650 --> 12:51.350
Yeah, sure.

13:17.050 --> 13:20.050
You go ahead and be scared.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.550
You've been brave enough
for one day.

13:26.550 --> 13:29.850
I just want you
to relax now, okay?

13:29.950 --> 13:32.350
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

13:32.350 --> 13:35.850
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.050
Am I hurt?
I'm hurt bad, Larry.

13:40.950 --> 13:44.150
It's not good, no.

13:44.250 --> 13:45.650
Hey, Larry...

13:46.850 --> 13:49.750
bless your heart
for what you're tryin' to do.

13:51.050 --> 13:53.750
I was panicking
for a minute back there.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.950
But I got my senses back now.

13:58.050 --> 14:01.050
The situation is,
I'm shot in the belly.

14:01.150 --> 14:04.350
Without medical attention,
I'm gonna die.

14:07.950 --> 14:11.350
- I can't take you to a hospital.
- Fuck jail, man!

14:11.450 --> 14:16.050
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front, man.

14:16.150 --> 14:19.850
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

14:22.350 --> 14:26.650
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

14:26.650 --> 14:29.350
I swear to fucking God, man.

14:30.950 --> 14:34.650
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

14:35.750 --> 14:40.450
I won't tell them anything.

14:40.550 --> 14:42.450
You'll be safe, man.

14:43.950 --> 14:47.850
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid.
All right?

14:47.950 --> 14:51.050
Listen to me.
You're gonna be fine.

14:52.550 --> 14:54.550
Along with the kneecap...

14:54.650 --> 14:57.150
the gut is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.350
No shit!

14:58.450 --> 15:01.250
But it takes a long time
to die from it.

15:01.350 --> 15:03.750
I'm talkin' days.

15:03.850 --> 15:07.950
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

15:08.050 --> 15:09.850
Time is on your side.

15:09.850 --> 15:12.150
Was that a fucking setup, or what?

15:13.650 --> 15:15.750
Shit. Orange got tagged?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.550
Gut shot.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.950
Fuck. Where's Brown?

15:21.050 --> 15:22.350
Dead.

15:23.850 --> 15:25.850
How did he die?

15:25.950 --> 15:29.150
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.

15:30.050 --> 15:31.350
This is bad.

15:31.350 --> 15:35.150
This is so fucking bad.
Is it bad?

15:35.250 --> 15:36.850
As opposed to good?

15:38.150 --> 15:40.150
Man, this is fucked up.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.550
This is so fucked up.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.550
Somebody fucked us up
big time, man.

15:48.250 --> 15:52.250
- You really think we were set up?
- Do you even doubt it, man?

15:52.250 --> 15:56.750
I don't think we got set up, I know it.
Where did all those cops come from, huh?

15:56.750 --> 15:59.250
One minute they're not there,
and the next minute they're there.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.550
I didn't hear any sirens.
The alarm went off, okay?

16:02.650 --> 16:05.150
When an alarm goes, you got
a four-minute response time.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.850
Unless a patrol car is cruising
that street at that moment...

16:07.950 --> 16:10.550
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.

16:10.550 --> 16:13.550
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there...

16:13.650 --> 16:17.050
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing, and they were all there!

16:18.150 --> 16:20.950
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

16:21.050 --> 16:23.650
Those were the ones responding to the
alarm, but those first motherfuckers...

16:23.750 --> 16:26.150
they were there
and they were waitin' for us.

16:26.250 --> 16:28.750
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

16:28.850 --> 16:31.550
I haven't had a chance to think.

16:31.650 --> 16:34.950
First I was just tryin'
to get the fuck outta there.

16:34.950 --> 16:38.050
And after we got away,
I've just been dealin' with him.

16:38.150 --> 16:40.450
Better start thinkin' about it,
'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.

16:40.550 --> 16:43.450
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was just gonna drive off, man...

16:43.550 --> 16:46.050
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

16:46.150 --> 16:49.950
There could've been cops here waitin'!
There could be cops comin' right now!

16:53.650 --> 16:56.950
Let's go in the other room.
Hey. In there.

16:56.950 --> 16:59.550
Larry, don't leave me.

17:03.950 --> 17:07.550
I'll be right in the other room, okay?
I'll be right there lookin' at ya.

17:07.650 --> 17:10.250
I'm right here
lookin' at you, okay?

17:12.849 --> 17:14.849
I'm right over there.

17:17.050 --> 17:18.950
Larry...

17:18.950 --> 17:21.250
I'm gonna fucking die.

17:21.349 --> 17:23.150
Larry.

17:25.150 --> 17:27.550
What the fuck
am I doin' here, man?

17:27.650 --> 17:29.750
I felt funny about
this job right off.

17:29.850 --> 17:33.550
As soon as I felt it I should have said,
"No, thank you," but I never listen.

17:33.650 --> 17:35.950
Every time I ever got fucked
buying weed, the same thing.

17:36.050 --> 17:38.650
I didn't trust the guy,
but I wanted to believe him.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.650
If he's not lying and it really
is Thai stick, then it's great.

17:41.650 --> 17:45.150
But it never is, and I always said that
if I felt that about a job, I'd walk.

17:45.150 --> 17:48.350
And I didn't. I didn't
because of the fuckin' money!

17:48.350 --> 17:51.150
What's done is done.
I need you cool.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.150
Are you cool?

17:55.350 --> 17:56.950
I'm cool.

17:58.450 --> 18:00.950
Splash some water on your face.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.650
Take a breather.

18:21.050 --> 18:24.150
Relax. Have a cigarette.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.250
I quit.

18:26.250 --> 18:29.050
- All right.
- Why, you got one?

19:01.850 --> 19:05.450
Okay, let's go through
what happened.

19:05.550 --> 19:08.050
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

19:08.150 --> 19:10.250
Then the alarm gets tripped.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.750
I turn around
and all these cops are outside.

19:16.650 --> 19:20.250
You're right. It was like, bam,
I blinked my eyes and they're there.

19:20.250 --> 19:24.650
Everybody starts going ape-shit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts to shoot all--

19:24.750 --> 19:27.750
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

19:27.750 --> 19:31.550
Okay. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

19:31.550 --> 19:35.150
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

19:35.250 --> 19:38.350
- Soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- It wasn't that soon.

19:38.450 --> 19:42.350
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.

19:42.350 --> 19:45.350
I'm not sayin' they weren't there.
I'm sayin' they were there.

19:45.350 --> 19:49.250
But they didn't make a move until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

19:49.350 --> 19:52.350
I mean, that's how
I know we were set up.

19:52.350 --> 19:55.750
- Mr. White, you can see that--
- Enough of this "Mr. White" shit.

19:55.850 --> 19:59.450
Wait! Don't tell me you're fuckin' name!
I don't wanna know it!

19:59.550 --> 20:02.150
Jesus Christ,
I ain't gonna tell you mine.

20:07.450 --> 20:09.750
You're right.
This is bad.

20:15.050 --> 20:18.650
- How did you get out?
- I shot my way out.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.150
Everybody started shootin',
so I blasted my way out of there.

20:25.350 --> 20:29.250
Move it! Get outta the way!
Get the fuck outta the way!

20:31.150 --> 20:32.850
Get the fuck outta the way!

20:34.450 --> 20:36.150
Move it!
Get outta the way!

20:41.850 --> 20:44.950
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is your problem, man?

20:45.050 --> 20:48.250
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck you!

20:48.350 --> 20:49.350
Move!

20:56.750 --> 20:57.950
Jesus!

20:58.050 --> 21:00.450
Get outta the car!
Get the fuck outta the car!

21:00.550 --> 21:02.750
Move it!
Move outta the way!

21:31.850 --> 21:34.350
I tagged a couple of cops.

21:34.450 --> 21:36.550
Did you kill anybody?

21:36.550 --> 21:39.750
- A few cops.
- No real people?

21:39.750 --> 21:41.750
Just cops.

21:53.150 --> 21:55.150
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

21:56.650 --> 21:59.650
That was the most insane
fuckin' thing I have ever seen.

21:59.650 --> 22:02.350
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

22:02.450 --> 22:04.050
I don't want to kill anybody.

22:04.150 --> 22:06.750
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standin' in my way...

22:06.750 --> 22:09.250
one way or the other
you're gettin' outta my way.

22:09.250 --> 22:11.650
That's the way I look at it.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.350
The choice between
doin' ten years...

22:14.450 --> 22:17.250
and takin' out
some stupid motherfucker...

22:18.250 --> 22:20.350
ain't no choice at all.

22:20.450 --> 22:23.050
But I ain't no madman, either.

22:23.150 --> 22:26.850
What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?
You can't work with a guy like that.

22:29.350 --> 22:32.750
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

22:32.850 --> 22:36.750
I came this close
to takin' his ass out myself.

22:36.850 --> 22:39.850
I mean, everybody panics.
Everybody.

22:39.950 --> 22:42.650
Things get tense.
It's human nature.

22:42.650 --> 22:46.450
You panic. I don't care what
your name is, you can't help it.

22:46.450 --> 22:50.350
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside,
in your head, you know?

22:50.450 --> 22:54.650
You give yourself a couple of seconds,
get ahold of it and deal with it.

22:54.750 --> 22:57.750
What you don't do is start shootin' up
the place and start killin' people.

22:57.850 --> 23:02.050
What you're supposed to do
is act like a fuckin' professional.

23:02.150 --> 23:06.650
A psychopath ain't a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath.

23:06.750 --> 23:09.350
You don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.

23:11.350 --> 23:15.650
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was? Twenty?

23:15.650 --> 23:18.050
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.650
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

23:23.950 --> 23:27.450
Me and Orange jumped in the car,
Brown floored it.

23:27.450 --> 23:29.650
After that,
I don't know what went down.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.750
It was every man for himself.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.750
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest...

23:34.750 --> 23:36.950
'cause once I got out,
I never looked back.

23:37.050 --> 23:39.050
What do you think?

23:39.150 --> 23:42.450
What do I think? The cops either
caught 'em or killed 'em.

23:44.250 --> 23:46.850
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

23:46.950 --> 23:49.350
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

23:49.350 --> 23:53.150
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

23:53.250 --> 23:56.550
You don't think it's possible one of 'em
got ahold of the diamonds and--

23:56.650 --> 24:00.050
- No, no way.
- How can you be so sure?

24:01.450 --> 24:03.950
I got the diamonds.

24:11.650 --> 24:13.950
That's my boy.

24:13.950 --> 24:16.750
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

24:16.750 --> 24:21.050
If you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em right now, this second.

24:21.050 --> 24:24.650
'Cause I think stayin' here, man, we
should have our fuckin' heads examined.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.850
That was the plan.
We meet here.

24:26.950 --> 24:28.850
Then where the fuck is everybody?

24:28.950 --> 24:32.050
I say the plan becomes null and void
once we found out we got a rat here.

24:32.050 --> 24:35.150
We ain't got the slightest idea
what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.650
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.650
The cops could have 'em right now
at the station, sweatin' 'em down.

24:40.650 --> 24:44.250
They don't know our names, but they
could be singin' about this place.

24:52.250 --> 24:55.950
I swear to God,
I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.

24:56.050 --> 24:57.950
What?

24:59.750 --> 25:02.850
Two jobs back,
it was a four-man job.

25:02.950 --> 25:05.350
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

25:07.250 --> 25:08.950
No shit?

25:10.050 --> 25:12.550
Thank God we discovered in time.

25:12.650 --> 25:15.750
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

25:16.850 --> 25:19.050
So who's the rat this time?

25:19.150 --> 25:21.050
Mr. Blue?

25:21.150 --> 25:22.850
Mr. Brown?

25:22.950 --> 25:27.150
Joe? Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.

25:27.150 --> 25:30.650
I don't buy it.
Me and Joe go back a long time.

25:30.750 --> 25:34.050
I can tell you definitely, Joe didn't
know a thing about this bullshit.

25:34.150 --> 25:38.750
I know Joe, and me sayin' he definitely
had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.

25:38.850 --> 25:41.950
I can say I definitely didn't do it,
'cause I know what I did or didn't do.

25:42.050 --> 25:45.550
But I cannot definitely say that about
anybody, 'cause I don't definitely know.

25:45.550 --> 25:47.650
For all I know, you're the rat.

25:47.750 --> 25:50.150
For all I know,
you're the fuckin' rat!

25:50.150 --> 25:52.550
All right, now you're usin'
your fuckin' head.

25:52.650 --> 25:55.050
For all we know, he's the rat.

25:55.150 --> 25:58.450
That kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take...

25:58.550 --> 26:00.650
so don't you be calling him a rat!

26:00.650 --> 26:03.050
Look, I'm right, okay?

26:03.150 --> 26:05.650
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

26:10.350 --> 26:12.950
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.750
Go down the hall, make a left,
go up the stairs...

26:18.850 --> 26:20.750
and make a right.

26:28.350 --> 26:32.150
- By the way, how's Alabama?
- Alabama?

26:32.250 --> 26:35.850
I haven't seen Bama
in over a year and a half.

26:35.950 --> 26:38.350
But I thought you two
were a team.

26:39.450 --> 26:41.350
We were for a little while.

26:41.450 --> 26:45.150
Did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

26:45.150 --> 26:46.750
Why?

26:49.850 --> 26:53.650
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.850
What's she doin' now?

26:55.950 --> 26:59.450
She hooked up with Frank McGar.
They've done a couple jobs together.

26:59.550 --> 27:01.750
Hell of a woman.
Good little thief.

27:05.350 --> 27:09.050
- So explain the telegram.
- Five-man job.

27:09.150 --> 27:11.350
Bustin' in and bustin' out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

27:11.450 --> 27:14.450
Can you move the ice afterwards?
I don't know nobody that can move ice.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.750
No problem.
We got guys waitin' for it.

27:16.750 --> 27:20.050
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

27:20.150 --> 27:22.650
He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.

27:22.750 --> 27:25.950
Twenty years? Holy God.
What for?

27:26.050 --> 27:27.450
Bad luck.

27:27.550 --> 27:29.350
I guess you can say that again.

27:30.350 --> 27:32.250
What's the exposure like?

27:32.350 --> 27:35.250
Two minutes, tops.
But it's a tough two minutes.

27:35.250 --> 27:38.750
Daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.

27:38.850 --> 27:41.250
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

27:41.350 --> 27:44.250
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.050
Security pretty lax.

27:46.150 --> 27:48.550
They most usually
just deal in boxes.

27:48.550 --> 27:51.550
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

27:51.650 --> 27:56.350
But on this day, they're getting a
shipment of polished stones from lsrael.

27:56.450 --> 27:58.650
They're like a way station,
you know?

27:58.750 --> 28:02.050
-They get picked up and sent to Vermont.
-No, they're not.

28:05.650 --> 28:07.550
What's the cut, poppa?

28:07.650 --> 28:11.250
Juicy, junior.
Real juicy.

28:13.950 --> 28:16.550
Look, man, you do what you want.

28:16.650 --> 28:19.450
I'm outta here, man. I'm gonna
check into a motel for a few days.

28:19.450 --> 28:22.450
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe--

28:22.550 --> 28:25.150
Shit. Did he fuckin' die on us?

28:26.750 --> 28:29.450
Huh? ls he dead or what?

28:30.950 --> 28:33.850
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?

28:33.950 --> 28:36.650
I think he's just passed out.

28:36.650 --> 28:40.850
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
I thought he was dead for sure.

28:40.850 --> 28:43.650
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

28:44.750 --> 28:47.750
What are we gonna do, man?
We can't take him to the hospital.

28:49.350 --> 28:53.250
Without medical attention,
he might not live through the night.

28:53.350 --> 28:56.150
The bullet in his belly
is my fault.

28:56.150 --> 28:59.950
While that might not mean jack shit
to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

29:00.050 --> 29:03.850
First things first, okay?
Stayin' here's goofy. We gotta book up.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.550
So what do you suggest we do?
Go to a hotel?

29:06.650 --> 29:10.850
We got a guy who's shot in the belly,
who can't walk, bleeds like a stuck pig.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.250
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

29:14.350 --> 29:16.350
You got an idea, spit it out.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.250
Joe could help.

29:18.250 --> 29:23.050
If we could get in touch with Joe,
Joe could get him to a doctor.

29:23.150 --> 29:26.150
Joe could get a doctor
to come to see him.

29:26.250 --> 29:30.350
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how we gonna get in touch with him?

29:30.350 --> 29:34.350
He's supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about bein' here.

29:34.450 --> 29:38.150
Even if he is on the up and up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.850
He planned a robbery and
he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.

29:40.950 --> 29:44.250
He's got dead cops, dead robbers,
dead civilians.

29:44.350 --> 29:47.050
I tend to doubt he's gonna have
a lot of sympathy for our plight.

29:47.150 --> 29:51.850
If I was him, I'd put as much distance
between me and this mess as possible.

29:55.550 --> 29:58.350
Before you got here,
Mr. Orange...

29:58.450 --> 30:02.250
was askin' me to take him
to a doctor, to a hospital.

30:04.050 --> 30:07.350
I don't like the idea of
turnin' him over to the cops...

30:07.350 --> 30:10.150
but if we don't,
he's gonna die.

30:10.150 --> 30:13.050
He begged me to do it.

30:13.150 --> 30:17.050
Well, all right.
Then I guess we take him to a hospital.

30:17.150 --> 30:19.250
If that's what he said,
let's do it.

30:19.350 --> 30:22.050
Since he don't know nothin' about us,
I say it's his decision.

30:22.150 --> 30:23.750
He knows a little about me.

30:26.850 --> 30:30.150
What? Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?

30:30.250 --> 30:33.350
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

30:33.450 --> 30:34.850
Why?

30:36.350 --> 30:39.050
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.

30:39.050 --> 30:41.750
It was just
a natural conversation.

30:41.850 --> 30:44.850
What was tellin' him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

30:44.950 --> 30:46.550
He asked.

30:48.050 --> 30:51.550
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.

30:51.650 --> 30:55.150
It was my fault he got shot.

30:55.150 --> 30:57.650
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

30:57.650 --> 31:00.150
He's screamin'.

31:00.150 --> 31:03.350
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

31:03.450 --> 31:07.350
I'm tryin' to comfort him,
telling him not to worry...

31:07.450 --> 31:11.050
everything's going to be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him.

31:11.150 --> 31:13.450
And he asked me
what my name was.

31:15.250 --> 31:19.750
I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

31:21.250 --> 31:26.050
Tell him I'm sorry? I can't
give out that fuckin' information?

31:26.150 --> 31:29.150
It's against the rules?

31:29.250 --> 31:32.150
I don't trust you enough?

31:32.250 --> 31:35.450
Maybe I should've,
but I couldn't.

31:35.550 --> 31:38.050
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!

31:38.150 --> 31:41.350
- I'm sure it was a beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronize me!

31:41.350 --> 31:43.850
I have one question. Do they have
a sheet on you where you're from?

31:43.950 --> 31:46.150
- Yeah!
- That's that, then.

31:46.250 --> 31:49.150
I mean, I was worried about
mug shot possibility as it was.

31:49.150 --> 31:53.550
He knows A, your name, B, your face,
C, your hometown and D, your specialty.

31:53.650 --> 31:56.850
They're not gonna have to show him a lot
of pictures for him to pick you out!

31:56.950 --> 32:00.550
You didn't tell him anything else
so they could narrow down the selection?

32:00.650 --> 32:04.250
If I have to tell you again to back off,
we're gonna go 'round and 'round.

32:04.250 --> 32:07.250
We ain't takin' him to a hospital.

32:07.350 --> 32:08.950
If we don't, he's gonna die.

32:09.050 --> 32:12.150
And I'm very sad about that, but
some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

32:12.250 --> 32:14.850
What the fuck are you
touchin' me for, man?

32:20.250 --> 32:22.350
I'll show you
who you're fuckin' with!

32:22.350 --> 32:24.550
You wanna shoot me,
you piece of shit?

32:24.650 --> 32:27.650
I didn't create this situation,
I'm dealin' with it!

32:27.750 --> 32:31.550
You're actin' like a first-year thief!
I'm actin' like a professional!

32:31.650 --> 32:34.450
If they get him, they could get you,
they could get closer to me...

32:34.450 --> 32:36.450
and that can't happen!

32:36.550 --> 32:39.250
You're lookin' at me like it's my fault?
I didn't tell him my name!

32:39.350 --> 32:41.850
I didn't tell him
where I was from!

32:41.950 --> 32:44.550
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago
you almost told me your name!

32:44.550 --> 32:46.750
You're gonna get stuck
in a situation you created!

32:46.850 --> 32:50.350
So if you wanna throw bad looks around,
throw 'em at a mirror!

32:50.350 --> 32:53.350
You kids shouldn't play so rough.

32:53.350 --> 32:56.250
Somebody's gonna start cryin'.

32:56.350 --> 32:57.950
Mr. Blonde.

33:00.050 --> 33:02.350
Shit. You're fuckin' kickin' me.

33:07.150 --> 33:10.950
What happened to you?
Figured you were dead.

33:14.550 --> 33:17.250
Hey, you okay?

33:18.550 --> 33:20.850
Did you see what happened to Blue?

33:20.950 --> 33:24.550
We didn't know what happened to you.
That's what we were wonderin' about.

33:26.650 --> 33:29.450
Look, Brown is dead,
Orange got it in the belly.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.750
Enough! Enough!

33:31.850 --> 33:34.950
You better start talkin', asshole.

33:34.950 --> 33:37.850
'Cause we got shit
we need to talk about.

33:37.950 --> 33:39.650
We're already freaked out.

33:39.750 --> 33:43.150
We need you actin' freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

33:44.050 --> 33:45.950
Okay, let's talk.

33:46.050 --> 33:48.450
We think we got
a rat in the house.

33:48.550 --> 33:50.550
I guarantee we got
a rat in the house.

33:50.650 --> 33:52.450
What makes you say that?

33:52.450 --> 33:54.450
Is that supposed to be funny?

33:54.550 --> 33:57.250
Look, we think
this place ain't safe.

33:57.350 --> 34:00.150
This place ain't secure anymore.
We're leavin' and you should go with us.

34:00.250 --> 34:02.450
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

34:03.350 --> 34:06.050
Piss on this fuckin' turd.

34:06.150 --> 34:09.250
- We're outta here.
- Don't take another step, Mr. White.

34:09.350 --> 34:12.150
Fuck you, maniac!

34:14.949 --> 34:16.949
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

34:17.050 --> 34:19.550
What's this guy's problem?

34:19.650 --> 34:22.550
What's my problem?
Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem!

34:22.650 --> 34:25.449
I got a big fuckin' problem...

34:25.550 --> 34:28.550
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

34:30.350 --> 34:34.050
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- That fucking shooting spree!

34:35.350 --> 34:37.550
In the store! Remember?

34:37.650 --> 34:42.449
Oh, fuck 'em. They set off the alarm.
They deserve what they got.

34:42.449 --> 34:44.449
You almost killed me!

34:45.550 --> 34:46.850
Asshole!

34:49.250 --> 34:53.250
If I knew what kind of guy you were, I
never would've agreed to work with you.

34:54.850 --> 34:58.350
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

34:58.450 --> 35:00.350
or are you gonna bite?

35:00.450 --> 35:02.550
What was that?

35:05.150 --> 35:09.050
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
Would you repeat it?

35:09.150 --> 35:12.850
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

35:14.050 --> 35:15.950
or are you gonna bite?

35:16.050 --> 35:18.950
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Hey, come on!

35:19.050 --> 35:22.650
What, are we on a playground here?
Am I the only professional?

35:22.750 --> 35:25.050
You're actin' like
a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

35:25.150 --> 35:28.450
Ever work with niggers? Always sayin'
they're gonna kill each other.

35:28.550 --> 35:30.450
You said yourself
you thought about taking him out.

35:30.550 --> 35:33.050
- You fuckin' said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

35:33.150 --> 35:36.850
But that was then. Right now, this guy
is the only one I completely trust.

35:36.950 --> 35:39.750
-He's too homicidal to be with the cops.
-You takin' his side?

35:39.850 --> 35:42.850
Fuck sides, man!
What we need here is solidarity!

35:42.850 --> 35:46.850
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker
up our ass, and I want to know who.

35:48.550 --> 35:51.750
Fuck. Look, I know
I'm no piece of shit.

35:51.850 --> 35:55.650
I'm pretty sure you're okay, and I'm
fuckin' positive you're on the level.

35:55.750 --> 35:59.550
So let's try and figure out
who the bad guy is, all right?

36:01.950 --> 36:03.750
Wow.

36:03.850 --> 36:05.950
That was really exciting.

36:07.750 --> 36:10.750
I bet you're a big
Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?

36:13.050 --> 36:16.150
Yeah, me too.
I love that guy.

36:17.750 --> 36:22.550
My heart's beatin' so fast,
I'm about to have a heart attack here.

36:22.550 --> 36:27.450
I got somethin' outside that
I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.

36:27.450 --> 36:29.350
Follow you? Where?

36:30.350 --> 36:31.950
To my car.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.650
Did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?

36:35.650 --> 36:39.450
No, I had them already. I got somethin'
I think you might wanna see, though.

36:39.450 --> 36:41.450
- What?
- It's a big surprise.

36:41.550 --> 36:44.550
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

36:54.450 --> 36:56.750
We still gotta get
outta here, you know.

36:56.850 --> 36:59.350
No. We're gonna stick around
and we're gonna wait.

36:59.350 --> 37:02.750
- What for? The cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.

37:02.850 --> 37:07.350
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he
isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?

37:07.350 --> 37:10.750
Because I spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.

37:10.850 --> 37:14.050
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
didn't you say that in the first place?

37:14.150 --> 37:16.950
- 'Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fuckin'-har.

37:16.950 --> 37:20.150
- What'd he say?
- He said stay put.

37:20.250 --> 37:22.750
So in the meantime...

37:22.850 --> 37:25.450
I'll show you guys somethin'.

37:30.050 --> 37:31.650
Jesus Christ.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.750
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions...

37:34.850 --> 37:38.150
about this rat business
you've been talkin' about.

37:38.250 --> 37:41.250
You're a piece of work,
my friend.

37:41.350 --> 37:43.350
Let's get him
the fuck outta here.

37:45.750 --> 37:47.950
Hey, Sid, will you relax?

37:48.050 --> 37:50.350
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

37:50.350 --> 37:52.850
I know you'll pay me back.

37:52.950 --> 37:56.750
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

37:56.850 --> 38:00.950
So you had a few bad months.
You do what everybody else does.

38:00.950 --> 38:05.850
I don't care if it's J.P. Morgan
or lrving the tailor. You ride it out.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.550
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.

38:08.650 --> 38:10.650
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

38:10.750 --> 38:13.550
Tell him to come in.
I gotta go.

38:13.550 --> 38:16.050
- Come on in.
- A friend of mine's outside.

38:16.050 --> 38:18.750
I'll be talkin' to you.
Don't worry.

38:23.350 --> 38:25.750
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

38:26.850 --> 38:29.150
How does freedom feel, huh?

38:29.250 --> 38:32.350
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

38:32.450 --> 38:35.350
Sit down, take your coat off,
make yourself at home.

38:35.450 --> 38:37.350
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

38:37.450 --> 38:40.450
How about a little Remy Martin?

38:40.550 --> 38:42.550
Sure.

38:42.650 --> 38:44.650
Who's your parole officer?

38:45.950 --> 38:48.050
Seymour Scagnetti.

38:48.150 --> 38:50.650
How is he?

38:50.750 --> 38:52.650
He's a fuckin' asshole.

38:52.750 --> 38:54.750
Won't even let me
leave the halfway house.

38:54.750 --> 38:57.350
It never ceases to amaze me.

38:57.450 --> 39:01.650
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there,
slits a woman's throat for 25 cents...

39:01.750 --> 39:04.550
he gets Doris Day
for a parole officer.

39:04.650 --> 39:08.250
A good fella like you
winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.

39:10.350 --> 39:13.750
I want you to know I appreciate all
the packages you sent me on the inside.

39:13.850 --> 39:15.750
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

39:15.850 --> 39:17.850
Forget about you?

39:17.850 --> 39:20.750
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

39:20.850 --> 39:24.450
It was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could've done a lot more.

39:24.550 --> 39:27.450
Thanks a lot, Joe.

39:27.550 --> 39:28.950
Ah, Vic.

39:32.250 --> 39:34.250
Toothpick Vic.

39:35.950 --> 39:39.850
So tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

39:39.950 --> 39:43.450
You son of a bitch. I see you
sittin' there, but I don't believe it.

39:43.550 --> 39:45.950
- How you doin', Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

39:50.850 --> 39:53.950
Listen, I'm sorry.
I should've picked you up myself.

39:54.050 --> 39:56.650
I was-- My fuckin'--
This week's been crazy.

39:56.750 --> 39:58.950
I've had my head up my ass
the whole time.

39:59.050 --> 40:02.150
Funny you say that, 'cause that's what
me and your daddy were talkin' about.

40:02.250 --> 40:04.150
That I should've picked you up?

40:04.250 --> 40:06.950
No, that you had
your head up your ass.

40:09.150 --> 40:11.250
I walk in the door, he's like,
"Vic, Vic...

40:11.350 --> 40:15.050
I'm so glad somebody's finally here
who knows what's goin' on.

40:15.150 --> 40:17.750
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.

40:17.750 --> 40:20.750
He's ruining the business.

40:20.850 --> 40:24.750
I mean, I love the guy, but he's
flushin' everything down the toilet."

40:24.850 --> 40:28.050
That's what you said, right, Joe?
Tell him yourself.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.850
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this...

40:30.950 --> 40:34.750
but Vic came in
and asked me how business was.

40:34.850 --> 40:37.750
You don't lie to a guy who's
just done four years in the slammer.

40:37.850 --> 40:39.050
That's very true.

40:44.450 --> 40:46.850
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

40:46.950 --> 40:49.150
Come on, this ain't a playground!

40:53.150 --> 40:58.250
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.

40:58.350 --> 41:01.150
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

41:01.250 --> 41:03.350
The guy got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me.

41:03.450 --> 41:06.050
- You wish.
- You sick bastard, Vic.

41:06.150 --> 41:08.550
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.

41:08.650 --> 41:11.850
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home...

41:11.950 --> 41:14.250
go to it,
but don't try to fuck me.

41:14.250 --> 41:16.450
I don't think of you that way.

41:16.550 --> 41:20.650
I like you a lot, buddy,
but I don't think of you that way.

41:22.650 --> 41:27.150
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy,
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

41:27.250 --> 41:30.650
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

41:30.750 --> 41:35.150
Four years fuckin' punks up the ass,
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.

41:35.250 --> 41:38.550
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

41:38.650 --> 41:40.250
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

41:40.350 --> 41:43.550
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.

41:43.650 --> 41:46.650
You know what?
I think it's all that black semen...

41:46.650 --> 41:49.250
pumped up your asshole, now it's
backed into your fuckin' brain...

41:49.250 --> 41:52.150
and it's comin' out your mouth!

41:52.250 --> 41:56.050
Eddie, you keep talkin' like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

41:56.150 --> 41:59.050
Enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

41:59.150 --> 42:01.250
Now both of you, sit down.

42:06.450 --> 42:08.650
Now, Eddie...

42:08.650 --> 42:11.650
when you came in here,
we were talkin' some serious business.

42:12.850 --> 42:14.750
Vic here's got a parole problem.

42:14.850 --> 42:17.750
- Who's your P.O.?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

42:17.850 --> 42:20.450
Scagnetti. Fuck.

42:20.550 --> 42:24.550
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

42:24.650 --> 42:27.850
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

42:27.950 --> 42:30.250
You're comin' back
to work for us, right?

42:33.750 --> 42:35.750
Well, I wanna.

42:35.850 --> 42:38.650
But first I gotta prove to,
uh, ass-head...

42:38.750 --> 42:42.150
that I can get a regular,
you know, job-type job...

42:42.250 --> 42:45.350
before I can move out on my own.

42:45.450 --> 42:48.850
I can't come back to work for you guys
if I gotta worry about, uh...

42:48.850 --> 42:51.250
makin' some silly-ass
10:00 curfew...

42:51.350 --> 42:53.250
every fuckin' night.

42:53.350 --> 42:56.750
We can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?

42:56.850 --> 42:58.750
This ain't all that bad.

42:58.850 --> 43:01.950
We can get you
a lot of legitimate jobs.

43:02.250 --> 43:05.150
I'll get you down in Long Beach
as a dockworker.

43:05.150 --> 43:08.550
I don't wanna lift
no fuckin' crates, Eddie.

43:08.550 --> 43:12.050
You ain't gonna lift shit.
You don't even work there.

43:12.150 --> 43:15.150
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

43:15.250 --> 43:19.150
I call Matthews and tell him he's got
a new guy, boom, you're on the rotation.

43:19.250 --> 43:23.150
You get a time card. It's clocked
in and out for you every day.

43:23.150 --> 43:27.850
At the end of the week you get a nice
paycheck. Dockworkers do very well.

43:27.950 --> 43:30.550
You can move into a halfway decent place
without Scagnetti goin'...

43:30.650 --> 43:32.850
"Where the fuck's
the money comin' from?"

43:32.950 --> 43:36.450
And, if he decides
to make a surprise visit...

43:36.550 --> 43:40.850
that's the day we sent you to Tustin
to pick up a load of shit.

43:40.950 --> 43:44.050
If he comes back again, hey,
"Sorry, Seymour.

43:44.150 --> 43:45.750
You just missed him.

43:45.850 --> 43:49.350
We had to send him to the Taft airstrip
five fuckin' hours away.

43:49.450 --> 43:52.150
We had a load of shit he had to
pick up there and bring back here."

43:52.250 --> 43:55.850
Part of your job is goin' different
places. That's the beauty of it.

43:55.850 --> 43:58.550
We got places all over the place.

43:58.650 --> 44:00.850
See, Vic?
Did I tell you not to worry?

44:00.950 --> 44:04.850
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.

44:04.950 --> 44:08.850
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

44:10.450 --> 44:13.250
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doin'...

44:13.350 --> 44:16.050
but I'd like to know
when I can come back...

44:16.150 --> 44:18.350
you know, do some real work.

44:18.450 --> 44:20.750
Well, it's hard to say.

44:20.850 --> 44:23.750
It's kind of a strange time now.

44:23.750 --> 44:26.250
Things are kind of--

44:26.250 --> 44:29.350
They're a little fucked up,
is what they are.

44:29.450 --> 44:32.550
We're just gettin' ready for
a big meetin' right now in Vegas.

44:32.550 --> 44:37.150
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

44:37.250 --> 44:40.550
Get you a job,
give you some cash...

44:40.650 --> 44:43.750
and get this Scagnetti fuck
off your back...

44:43.850 --> 44:47.050
and then we'll talk
to you, all right?

44:47.150 --> 44:48.150
Huh?

44:48.250 --> 44:51.950
Dad, I got an idea.

44:51.950 --> 44:54.750
Just hear me out.

44:54.750 --> 44:58.350
I know you don't like usin'
the boys on these jobs...

44:58.450 --> 45:02.850
but Vic here-- I mean, he's only
been nothin' but good luck for us.

45:02.950 --> 45:05.950
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot,
for cryin' out loud.

45:07.150 --> 45:09.450
I'd like to have him in.

45:09.550 --> 45:13.150
You know he can handle himself, and
you damn sure know you can trust him.

45:14.850 --> 45:16.850
All right, Vic...

45:16.950 --> 45:21.050
how would you feel about pullin'
a job with about five other guys?

45:23.650 --> 45:25.750
I'd feel great about it.

45:30.550 --> 45:34.250
K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

45:34.350 --> 45:36.450
If you're the 12th caller...

45:36.450 --> 45:39.950
you'll win two tickets to
the monster truck extravaganza...

45:39.950 --> 45:43.250
being held tonight
at the Carson Fairgrounds...

45:43.350 --> 45:48.350
featuring Big Daddy Don Bodine's truck,
"The Behemoth."

45:48.450 --> 45:53.350
The 12th caller wins on the station
where the '70s survived.

45:58.450 --> 46:01.950
Hey, Dov, we got
a major situation here.

46:02.050 --> 46:05.550
I know you know that. I gotta talk to
Daddy and find out what he wants done.

46:13.350 --> 46:17.750
All I know is what Vic told me.
The place turned into a bullet-fest.

46:17.850 --> 46:20.350
He took a cop hostage
just to get the fuck outta there.

46:20.450 --> 46:22.350
Get up! Get up!

46:25.550 --> 46:27.750
Do I sound like
I'm fuckin' jokin'?

46:27.750 --> 46:30.150
He's fuckin' drivin' around
with a cop in his trunk!

46:34.950 --> 46:36.850
I don't know who did what!

46:36.950 --> 46:40.050
I don't know who's got the loot.
I don't know if anybody's got the loot.

46:40.150 --> 46:44.050
I don't know who's dead, who's alive,
who's caught, who's not.

46:59.750 --> 47:02.750
I will know.
I'm practically there now.

47:03.950 --> 47:06.750
But what do I tell
these guys about Daddy?

47:08.950 --> 47:12.150
All right.
You sure that's what he said?

47:13.650 --> 47:15.850
Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.

47:15.950 --> 47:17.950
Huh? Fuck you!

47:18.050 --> 47:20.550
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

47:20.650 --> 47:22.150
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

47:25.450 --> 47:28.250
You're gonna suffer
for nothin', pal.

47:28.350 --> 47:30.650
You hear me?
'Cause you're gonna fuckin' talk.

47:30.750 --> 47:33.650
- I don't fucking know anything!
- You fuckin' know.

47:33.750 --> 47:36.350
You know. Look at me.
You fuckin' know.

47:36.450 --> 47:38.850
What in the Sam Hill's
goin' on here?

47:38.950 --> 47:42.050
- Nice Guy, we got a cop.
- Where the fuck is Joe?

47:43.250 --> 47:45.250
Holy shit. Orange is dead.

47:45.350 --> 47:49.250
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.

47:49.350 --> 47:51.750
We were set up.
The cops were there waitin' for us.

47:51.850 --> 47:54.150
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up.

47:54.250 --> 47:55.850
The cops were there
waitin' for us.

47:55.950 --> 47:57.650
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you, man!

47:57.750 --> 48:01.050
You weren't there, we were,
and the cops had that store staked out.

48:01.150 --> 48:04.450
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective,
you're so fuckin' smart.

48:04.550 --> 48:07.850
- Who did it?
- We've been askin' each other!

48:07.850 --> 48:10.850
What'd you come up with?
You think I fuckin' set you up?

48:10.950 --> 48:13.750
I don't know, but somebody did.

48:15.050 --> 48:18.550
Nobody did. You fuckin' assholes
turned the jewelry store--

48:18.650 --> 48:21.650
- Don't you call me an asshole!
- You fuckin' idiot!

48:21.750 --> 48:23.750
Turned the jewelry store
into a wild west show...

48:23.850 --> 48:26.250
and you wonder why
the fuckin' cops show up?

48:27.850 --> 48:29.250
Where's Joseph?

48:29.350 --> 48:31.550
I don't know.
I ain't talked to him.

48:31.650 --> 48:36.050
I talked to Dov. He says Daddy's comin'
down here and he's fuckin' pissed.

48:36.150 --> 48:38.550
He's pissed?
I told you he'd be pissed.

48:38.650 --> 48:40.150
What'd Joe say?

48:40.250 --> 48:42.150
I told you,
I ain't talked to him!

48:42.250 --> 48:45.150
- All I know is he's pissed.
- What are you gonna do about him?

48:45.850 --> 48:49.450
Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe.
I got a few questions of my own here.

48:49.450 --> 48:50.850
You ain't dying. He is.

48:50.950 --> 48:54.450
All right, Mr. Fuckin' Compassion,
I will call somebody!

48:54.550 --> 48:56.350
Who?

48:56.350 --> 48:59.850
A fuckin' snake charmer!
Who do you think? I'll call a doctor.

48:59.850 --> 49:03.750
They'll fix him right up.
What happened to Brown and Blue?

49:03.850 --> 49:06.150
Brown's dead.
We don't know what happened to Blue.

49:06.150 --> 49:08.050
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

49:08.150 --> 49:12.150
I'm sure. I was there.
He took one in the head.

49:12.150 --> 49:14.450
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?

49:14.550 --> 49:16.750
Either he's alive or he's dead...

49:16.850 --> 49:19.850
or the cops got him
or they don't.

49:22.750 --> 49:25.250
I take it this is the bastard
you told me about.

49:25.350 --> 49:27.250
Why are you beatin' on him?

49:27.350 --> 49:29.750
Maybe he could tell us
who set us up.

49:29.850 --> 49:34.050
You beat this prick long enough, he'll
tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

49:34.050 --> 49:36.850
Now that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

49:36.950 --> 49:39.150
Come on, man, think!

49:39.250 --> 49:42.650
All right,
first things fuckin' last.

49:42.750 --> 49:47.250
Who's got the stones? Please, somebody
tell me one little fuckin' favor.

49:47.250 --> 49:48.850
I got a bag.

49:48.950 --> 49:52.950
Okay? I stashed it 'til we could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

49:53.050 --> 49:55.350
Good for you.
Now let's go get it.

49:55.450 --> 49:59.650
First we gotta get rid of those cars.
It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.

49:59.750 --> 50:00.750
Okay.

50:00.850 --> 50:04.750
Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.

50:04.750 --> 50:07.450
White and Pink,
take a car each.

50:07.550 --> 50:11.150
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.
Pick up the stones.

50:11.250 --> 50:14.350
While I'm followin' you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

50:14.450 --> 50:16.350
You can't leave these guys
here with him.

50:16.450 --> 50:19.850
- Why not?
- Because he's a fuckin' psycho.

50:21.050 --> 50:23.250
And if you think
Joe's pissed off...

50:23.350 --> 50:26.250
that ain't nothin' compared
to how pissed off I am at him...

50:26.350 --> 50:28.450
for puttin' me
in the same room as that bastard.

50:30.650 --> 50:33.150
You see what I've been
puttin' up with, Eddie?

50:33.150 --> 50:38.250
I fuckin' walked in here,
I told these guys about stayin' put.

50:38.350 --> 50:41.350
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's stickin' it in my face...

50:41.450 --> 50:45.250
callin' me a motherfucker,
sayin' he's gonna blow me away...

50:45.350 --> 50:47.450
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

50:47.550 --> 50:50.950
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shootin' spree.

50:51.050 --> 50:53.650
What are you,
a fuckin' silent partner?

50:53.750 --> 50:55.550
Tell him!

50:55.550 --> 50:58.150
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.

50:59.350 --> 51:03.150
This is what he was doin':
bam, bam...

51:03.250 --> 51:05.950
bam, bam.

51:06.050 --> 51:08.350
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

51:08.450 --> 51:11.550
I told 'em not to touch
the fuckin' alarm, they did.

51:11.650 --> 51:16.150
If they hadn't have done what I told 'em
not to do, they'd still be alive.

51:17.850 --> 51:19.950
My fuckin' hero.

51:21.650 --> 51:23.650
Thanks.

51:23.750 --> 51:26.450
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

51:26.550 --> 51:28.650
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.

51:32.250 --> 51:34.550
What does it matter
who stays with the cop?

51:34.550 --> 51:36.650
We ain't lettin' him go.
He's seen everybody.

51:36.750 --> 51:38.750
I haven't been looking at you guys.

51:38.850 --> 51:41.350
Shut the fuck up, man!

51:41.350 --> 51:44.250
You guys should never have taken him
outta the trunk in the first place.

51:44.350 --> 51:48.350
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- There is no fuckin' setup!

51:48.450 --> 51:50.150
Now here's the news!

51:50.250 --> 51:53.350
Blondie, you stay here,
take care of these two!

51:53.350 --> 51:55.650
White and Pink, you come with me,
'cause if Joe gets here...

51:55.750 --> 51:57.950
and he sees all these
cars parked outside...

51:58.050 --> 52:01.050
I swear to you he's gonna be
just as mad at me as he is at you.

52:01.150 --> 52:03.150
Fine. Let's go.

52:23.950 --> 52:25.850
Alone at last.

52:47.350 --> 52:49.750
Guess what.

52:49.750 --> 52:52.450
I think I'm parked in the red zone.

52:57.650 --> 53:00.350
Now, where were we?

53:01.850 --> 53:05.250
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

53:06.750 --> 53:08.750
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

53:08.850 --> 53:11.050
They don't tell me anything.

53:12.650 --> 53:15.650
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.

53:15.650 --> 53:17.950
Torture you?
That's a good--

53:18.050 --> 53:21.150
That's a good idea.
I like that one, yeah.

53:22.650 --> 53:25.850
Even your boss said
there wasn't a setup.

53:27.850 --> 53:30.950
- My what?
- Your boss.

53:32.050 --> 53:33.950
Excuse me, pal.

53:34.050 --> 53:38.050
One thing I wanna make clear to you:
I don't have a boss.

53:38.150 --> 53:41.150
Nobody tells me what to do.
You understand?

53:41.250 --> 53:43.750
You hear what I said,
you son of a bitch?

53:43.850 --> 53:46.950
All right, all right, all right,
you don't have a boss.

53:49.950 --> 53:52.150
Get that fuckin' shit off.

54:00.350 --> 54:03.450
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?

54:04.950 --> 54:08.150
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know...

54:09.550 --> 54:12.150
but I'm gonna
torture you anyway...

54:14.150 --> 54:15.650
regardless.

54:15.750 --> 54:18.050
Not to get information.

54:19.650 --> 54:21.650
It's amusing to me...

54:21.650 --> 54:24.150
to torture a cop.

54:24.150 --> 54:27.350
You can say anything you want
because I've heard it all before.

54:28.950 --> 54:31.150
All you can do is...

54:31.250 --> 54:33.450
pray for a quick death...

54:36.050 --> 54:38.650
which...

54:38.750 --> 54:40.850
you ain't gonna get.

54:56.150 --> 54:57.850
Oh, God.

55:06.150 --> 55:10.150
You ever listen to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s"?

55:13.550 --> 55:15.850
It's my personal favorite.

55:22.050 --> 55:26.750
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel...

55:26.750 --> 55:30.850
when they recorded this Dylanesque,
pop, bubble-gum favorite...

55:30.950 --> 55:34.050
from April of 1974.

55:34.150 --> 55:36.050
That reached up to number five...

55:36.150 --> 55:39.550
as K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

56:28.550 --> 56:30.650
Hold still.

56:30.750 --> 56:32.850
Hold still, you fuck.

56:53.350 --> 56:55.750
Was that good for you too?

56:56.450 --> 56:58.350
Hey, what's goin' on?

56:58.350 --> 56:59.850
You hear that?

57:10.350 --> 57:12.750
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

58:56.950 --> 58:59.350
Don't! Stop! Stop!

59:00.750 --> 59:03.750
- What? What's the matter?
- Don't do this.

59:04.950 --> 59:06.850
That burn a little bit?

59:07.750 --> 59:09.350
Don't! Stop!

59:12.350 --> 59:14.150
Please stop.

59:14.150 --> 59:16.350
Just stop. Stop.

59:16.450 --> 59:18.350
Just talk to me.
Don't. Please.

59:18.450 --> 59:20.050
Don't burn me, please.

59:23.250 --> 59:26.950
I don't know anything about
any of you fucking guys.

59:26.950 --> 59:28.950
I'm not gonna say anything.

59:31.050 --> 59:32.250
No! Please, no.

59:32.350 --> 59:33.850
- You all through?
- Stop!

59:33.950 --> 59:35.050
You all through?

59:35.150 --> 59:38.650
Please.
I got a little kid at home.

59:39.250 --> 59:40.450
You all done?

59:40.450 --> 59:42.450
- Don't!
- Have some fire.

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.450
Oh, shit.

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:52.050
Hey, you.

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:57.150
What's your name?

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:01.650
Marvin.

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:04.850
Marvin what?

01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:10.650
Marvin Nash.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.150
Listen to me, Marvin.
I'm a--

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:24.850
Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
I'm a cop.

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.450
Yeah, I know.

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:32.550
You do?

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:37.050
Yeah.
Your name's Freddy somethin'.

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:39.750
Newendyke.

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:42.950
Freddy Newendyke.

01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:48.950
Frankie Ferchetti...

01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:52.850
introduced us
about five months ago.

01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:58.250
I don't remember that at all.

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.350
I do.

01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:08.850
Freddy.

01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:18.950
How do I look?

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.150
What?

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:33.650
I don't know what to tell you,
Marvin.

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:38.850
That fuck.

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:43.850
That sick fuck!

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:46.850
That fuckin' bastard!

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:52.250
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:55.250
There's cops waiting to move
a block away.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:59.350
What the fuck
are they waiting for?

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:02.650
This fuckin' guy,
he slashes my face...

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.250
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!

01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:07.550
I'm fuckin' deformed!

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.150
Fuck you!

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:12.550
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:14.650
I'm fuckin' dyin'!

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:27.150
They're not to make a move
'til Joe Cabot shows up.

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:30.050
I was sent in to get him.

01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:31.650
All right?

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:34.750
You heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:37.250
Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin.

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:41.450
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed...

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:44.950
'til Joe Cabot sticks
his fuckin' head through that door.

01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:07.950
Say hello to a motherfucker
who's inside.

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:10.850
Cabot's doing a job.
He wants me on the team.

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:13.350
This better not be a joke.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:17.150
This ain't a joke.
I'm in. I'm up his ass.

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:27.650
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:31.650
He says I should just wait
for a phone call.

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:36.050
After waiting three days he calls me
last night and says Joe's ready.

01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:39.150
- He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
- Who picked you up?

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.850
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.
- What bar?

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:43.450
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:45.150
We get there...

01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:48.150
and I meet Joe
and a guy named Mr. White.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:50.150
Phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:53.050
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:56.250
Okay, Mr. Orange.

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:59.950
- You ever see this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr. White?

01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:01.650
Yes. Mr. White.

01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:07.250
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
He's gotta be from out of town.

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:09.550
- Joe knows him good.
- How can you tell?

01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:12.650
The way they talk.
You can tell they're buddies.

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.850
- You two talk?
- Me and Joe?

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:16.850
Mr. White.

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:18.550
- A little.
- About what?

01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:19.650
The Brewers.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.150
Milwaukee Brewers?

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:24.350
They won the night before.
He made some money off them.

01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:29.150
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan,
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:32.050
And I'll bet you everything...

01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:35.250
they got a sheet in Milwaukee
on this Mr. White's ass.

01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:39.650
So I want you to go through
everybody in Milwaukee...

01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:43.150
with a history of armed robbery
and put a name to the face.

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:45.750
- Nice work, Freddy.
- Thank you, my man.

01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:49.450
- How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
- Perfect.

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:53.750
His backing me up went a long way.
I told them I played poker with him.

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:56.750
Nice Guy checked it out
and said it was A-okay.

01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:59.750
Said I was a good thief,
I didn't rattle...

01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:02.150
and that I was ready to move.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:04.950
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside without him.

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:09.450
Long Beach Mike
is not your friend.

01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:11.750
Long Beach Mike
is a fucking scumbag.

01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:13.750
He's selling out his friends.

01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:16.650
That's how nice he fuckin' is.

01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:18.650
I'll take care of his ass...

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:22.550
but you get that scumbag out of mind
and take care of business.

01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:24.250
Gone.

01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:31.950
Use the commode story?

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:35.550
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene. Memorize it.

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:40.750
- A what?
- Undercover cops gotta be Brando.

01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:44.050
To do this job you gotta be
a great actor, naturalistic.

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:46.850
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:51.950
If you're a bad actor,
that's bullshit in this job.

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.350
What is this?

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:56.350
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:02.750
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a job.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:06.150
I gotta memorize all this?
There's four pages of this shit.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:08.850
Think about it like it's a joke.

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:12.050
Memorize what's important.
The rest you make your own.

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:14.050
You can tell a joke,
can't you?

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:17.150
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles...

01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:19.150
and tell a joke, all right?

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:22.050
The things you gotta remember
are the details.

01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:24.150
The details sell your story.

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:27.250
This particular story
takes place in a men's room.

01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:29.950
You gotta know
all the details--

01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:33.850
whether they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands.

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:37.650
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not.

01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:40.750
You gotta know if they got liquid soap
or that pink, granulated shit...

01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:42.750
they used in high school.

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:45.750
You gotta know if they got
hot water or not, if it stinks...

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:49.250
if some nasty, lowlife,
scum-ridden motherfucker...

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:51.750
sprayed diarrhea
all over one of the bowls.

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:55.150
You gotta know every detail
there is to know about this commode.

01:07:55.250 --> 01:08:00.150
What you gotta do is take
all them details and make 'em your own.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:04.050
While you're doing that, remember
that this story is about you...

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:07.350
and how you perceived
the events that went down.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.350
The only way to do that...

01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:12.350
is keep sayin' it...

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:14.950
and sayin' it and sayin' it.

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:23.250
This is during
the L.A. marijuana drought, 1986.

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:26.649
I still had a connection,
which was insane 'cause...

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.950
you couldn't get any weed
anywhere then.

01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:34.350
Anyway, I had a connection with
this hippie chick in Santa Cruz...

01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:36.350
and all my friends knew it.

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:39.149
They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy--"

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.950
I say, "Hey, dude.

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:47.149
You gettin' some?
Can you get some for me too?"

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:52.050
They knew I still smoked,
so they asked me to buy some for them.

01:08:52.050 --> 01:08:53.550
It got to be--

01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:03.550
Every time I bought some weed
I was buyin' for four or five people.

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:08.250
Finally I said, fuck this shit.
I'm makin' this bitch rich.

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:11.750
She didn't even have to
meet these people.

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:13.750
I was doing all the work.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:18.149
That got to be a pain in the ass,
people calling all the time.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:21.850
I couldn't even rent a tape
without six fuckin' interruptions.

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:24.050
"When's the next time
you're gettin' some?"

01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:26.550
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin'
to watch The Lost Boys.

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:28.550
When I get some,
I'll call you."

01:09:29.649 --> 01:09:32.050
Then these rink-a-dink
potheads come by.

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:34.649
They're my friends and everything,
but still--

01:09:34.649 --> 01:09:38.050
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags,
they don't want 60 dollars worth.

01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:41.450
They want ten dollars' worth,
and breaking it up wasn't easy.

01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:45.149
I don't even know
what ten dollars' worth looks like.

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.450
This was a very weird situation.

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:50.850
Remember back in '86...

01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:53.250
there was a major
fuckin' drought.

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:54.750
Nobody had anything.

01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:58.150
People were livin' on resin,
smokin' the wood in their pipes.

01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:02.150
This chick had a bunch
and she's beggin' me to sell it.

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:05.150
So I told her I wasn't gonna be
Joe the pot man anymore...

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:09.050
but I would take a little bit
and sell it to my close friends.

01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:11.750
She agreed and we kept
the same arrangement as before--

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.750
ten percent
and free pot for me...

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.750
if I helped her
that weekend.

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:19.150
She was sellin' a brick of weed
and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

01:10:19.150 --> 01:10:22.650
Her brother usually goes with her,
but he's in County unexpectedly.

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:23.850
What for?

01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:25.750
His traffic tickets
gone to warrant.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:29.650
They stopped him, found warrants
on him, took him to County.

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:32.650
She doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.

01:10:32.650 --> 01:10:36.450
I don't wanna do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.

01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:38.550
She keeps asking me, asking me.

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:41.550
Finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of hearing it.

01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:43.850
- So we go to the train station--
- Wait.

01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:46.950
You're goin' to the train station
with the weed on ya?

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:49.150
The guy needed it right away.

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:51.550
Anyway, we get to
the train station...

01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:53.650
and we're waitin' for the guy.

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:56.250
I'm carryin' the weed
in a carry-on bag.

01:10:56.350 --> 01:11:01.050
I gotta take a piss, so I tell her
I'm goin' to the boy's room.

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:08.250
So I walk into the men's room
and who's standing there?

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:13.350
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.

01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:19.050
- They're waitin' for you?
- No, they're just talkin'.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:22.150
When I walked in,
they all stopped talkin'...

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:24.550
and they looked at me.

01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:27.450
That's hard.
That's a fuckin' hard situation.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.150
German shepherd starts barking.

01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:33.450
He's barkin' at me.

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:36.150
I mean, it's obvious
he's barkin' at me.

01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:41.850
Every nerve ending, all of my senses,
the blood in the veins was screamin':

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:45.950
"Take off, man. Just bail.
Get the fuck outta there."

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:48.450
Panic hits me
like a bucket of water.

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:50.050
Bam! Right in the face.

01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:55.050
I'm drenched in panic and these cops
are lookin' at me and they know it.

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:58.550
They can smell it,
sure as that fuckin' dog can.

01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:00.550
They can smell it on me.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:03.050
Shut up.

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:07.550
So anyway,
I got my gun drawn.

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:10.550
I point it at this guy
and I tell him...

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:13.050
"Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move."

01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:16.050
This little idiot's
looking right at me and saying...

01:12:16.150 --> 01:12:17.950
"I know, I know."

01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:21.450
But meanwhile his right hand
is creepin' toward the glove box.

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:26.350
I scream at him, "Asshole!
I'm gonna blow you away right now!

01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:28.550
Put your hands on the dash."

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:31.650
He's still looking at me,
nodding his head.

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.050
"I know, buddy, I know."

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:37.850
Meanwhile his hand is still
going for the glove box.

01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:39.550
And I said...

01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:43.550
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face...

01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:46.250
if you don't put your hands up."

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:51.850
Then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy Oriental bitch...

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:55.250
she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:58.550
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"

01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:02.850
So then the guy snaps out of it
and puts his hands on the dash.

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:04.350
What was he goin' for?

01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:06.650
His fucking registration.

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.550
- You're kidding.
- No, man!

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:13.250
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close
he came to gettin' blown away.

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:14.750
That close, man.

01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:50.350
You knew how to handle
that situation.

01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:53.350
You shit your pants,
dive in and swim.

01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:57.950
Tell me more about Cabot.

01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:59.850
I don't know.

01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:01.850
He's a cool guy.

01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:06.250
He's funny.
He's a funny guy.

01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:09.250
You remember
the Fantastic Four?

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:12.250
Yeah, with that invisible bitch...

01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:14.250
and "Flame on"
and shit, right?

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:16.650
Thing.

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:18.550
Motherfucker...

01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:20.650
Iooks just like the Thing.

01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:27.450
Hey! Showtime!

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:30.450
Grab your jacket.
I'm parked outside.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.350
I'll be right down.

01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:35.150
He'll be right down.

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:57.250
Don't pussy out on me now.

01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:59.250
They don't know.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:01.550
They don't know shit.

01:16:01.650 --> 01:16:04.750
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're fuckin' Baretta.

01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:08.250
They believe every fuckin' word
'cause you're super cool.

01:16:15.650 --> 01:16:17.050
There goes our boy.

01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:20.250
The guy has to have rocks in his head
the size of Gibraltar...

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:21.850
to work undercover.

01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:24.850
- You want one of these?
- Yeah, give me the bear claw.

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:42.850
I know what I'm talking about.

01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:45.550
Black women ain't the same
as white women.

01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:47.050
There's a slight difference.

01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:49.850
Very funny.
You know what I mean.

01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:53.450
What a white bitch will put up with,
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.

01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:56.350
If you cross their line,
they fuck you up.

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.950
I gotta go along with Pink
on that.

01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:01.850
Okay, Mr. Expert,
if this is such a truism...

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:06.350
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:09.850
I'll bet those same niggers
who show their ass in public...

01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:12.850
when their bitches get 'em home
they chill the fuck out.

01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:16.050
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys too.

01:17:16.150 --> 01:17:18.150
Tell you guys a story.

01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:23.050
In one of Daddy's clubs there's
a black cocktail waitress named Elois.

01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:25.150
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:28.750
E and Lois.
We called her Lady E.

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:30.750
Where was she from?
Compton?

01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:34.250
She's from Ladora Heights.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:36.750
Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills.

01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:40.150
It's not
the black Beverly Hills.

01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:42.850
It's the black Palos Verdes.

01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:44.750
Anyway...

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:49.150
Lady E, she was a man-eater-upper.
Un-fuckin'-believable.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:54.050
Every guy who ever saw her
had to jack off to her at least once.

01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:57.050
You know who she looked like?
Christie Love.

01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:59.050
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love...

01:17:59.150 --> 01:18:01.450
about the black female cop?

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:04.450
She always used to say,
"You're under arrest, sugar! "

01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:09.450
- Who played Christie Love?
- Pam Grier.

01:18:09.450 --> 01:18:12.450
No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
Pam Grier was the other one.

01:18:12.450 --> 01:18:14.450
Pam Grier did the film.

01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:19.150
Christie Love was like
a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:22.450
- So, who was Christie Love?
- How should I know?

01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:24.450
Great. Now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured.

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:27.750
Whoever it was,
she looked exactly like Elois.

01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:29.250
Anne Francis.

01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:32.050
No. That was Honey West.

01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:33.850
Anne Francis is white.

01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:38.150
I'm tryin' to tell a story here.
She looked exactly like Elois.

01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:40.850
We come into the club
one night...

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:42.850
and there's Carlos,
the bartender.

01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:46.050
He's a wetback.
He's a friend of mine.

01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:48.750
I says to him,
"Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:51.850
Apparently Lady E...

01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:55.250
was married to real piece
of dog shit, a real animal.

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:57.550
He used to do things to her.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:59.550
Like what?
What would he do?

01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:01.350
Beat her up?

01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:04.350
I don't know.
He just did things.

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:08.050
So anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

01:19:08.150 --> 01:19:10.450
She waits for him to get drunk.

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:13.450
He falls asleep
on the fuckin' couch.

01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:17.850
She sneaks up on him,
puts some glue on his dick...

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:20.150
and glues his dick
to his belly.

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:22.950
Jesus Christ!

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:25.850
I'm serious, man.
I'm dead serious.

01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:29.250
They had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose.

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:32.450
Was he all pissed off?

01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:38.750
How would you feel if you had to do
a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?

01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:47.050
You guys like to tell jokes
and giggle and kid around, huh?

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:50.050
Giggling like a bunch of girls
in the schoolyard.

01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:52.050
Well, let me tell a joke.

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:55.750
Five guys
sittin' in a bullpen...

01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:57.650
San Quentin...

01:19:57.750 --> 01:20:00.650
wonderin' how the fuck
they got there.

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:04.150
"What did we do wrong?
What shouldn't we have done?

01:20:04.150 --> 01:20:06.150
It's your fault, his fault--"

01:20:06.150 --> 01:20:07.950
All that bullshit.

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:09.750
Finally somebody says...

01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:12.050
"Wait a minute.

01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:14.150
While we were
planning this caper...

01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:16.750
we just sat around
tellin' fuckin' jokes."

01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:18.550
Got the message?

01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:22.750
I don't mean to holler at ya.

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:27.350
When this caper's over,
and I'm sure it'll be successful...

01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:30.850
we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands,
I'll laugh with all of youse.

01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:32.950
Find me a different character
down there.

01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:35.350
Right now it's a matter
of business.

01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:38.950
With the exception
of Eddie and myself...

01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:40.850
who you already know...

01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:43.750
we're gonna be using aliases
on this job.

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:46.250
Under no circumstances...

01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:49.550
do we want any one of you
to relate to each other...

01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:51.850
by your Christian names.

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:56.250
And I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

01:20:56.350 --> 01:21:00.250
That includes where you been,
your wife's name...

01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:02.250
where you might've done time...

01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:06.150
or a bank maybe you robbed
in St. Petersburg.

01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:10.150
All I want you guys to talk about,
if you have to...

01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:12.850
is what you're gonna do.

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:15.050
That should do it.

01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:17.650
These are your names--

01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:20.650
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...

01:21:20.650 --> 01:21:23.150
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...

01:21:23.150 --> 01:21:25.350
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:29.050
- Why am I Mr. Pink?
- Because you're a faggot! All right?

01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:33.350
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:36.050
No way. Tried it once.
It doesn't work.

01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:39.550
You get four guys all fightin'
over who gets to be Mr. Black.

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:43.050
They don't know each other,
so nobody wants to back down.

01:21:43.150 --> 01:21:45.450
No way. I pick.
You're Mr. Pink.

01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:47.650
Be thankful
you're not Mr. Yellow.

01:21:48.850 --> 01:21:51.150
But Mr. Brown,
that's too close to Mr. Shit.

01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:53.150
Mr. Pink
sounds like Mr. Pussy.

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:55.050
How about Mr. Purple?

01:21:55.150 --> 01:21:57.150
That's sounds good.
I'll be Mr. Purple.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:59.650
You're not Mr. Purple.

01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:03.950
Some guy on some other job
is Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink!

01:22:04.050 --> 01:22:05.850
Who cares what your name is?

01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:09.550
Easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.

01:22:09.650 --> 01:22:13.350
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink,
you wanna trade?

01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:16.150
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.

01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:19.350
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know.

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:23.150
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:25.750
There's two ways you can go
on this job--

01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:28.150
my way or the highway.

01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:30.250
What's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:33.950
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fuckin' forget about it.

01:22:34.050 --> 01:22:36.650
It's beneath me.
I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.

01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:39.650
I'll move on
when I feel like it.

01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:42.650
Do all you guys
got the goddamn message?

01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:48.350
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin'
at you guys, I can hardly talk.

01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:51.750
Let's go to work.

01:22:51.850 --> 01:22:54.650
Let's go over it.
Where are you?

01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:58.350
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody go in or out.

01:22:59.050 --> 01:23:01.250
- Mr. Brown.
- He waits in the car.

01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:04.850
I give him the signal,
he pulls up in front.

01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:07.150
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.

01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:10.850
Crowd control. They handle
the customers and the employees.

01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:14.050
- That girl's ass.
- Sittin' right here on my dick.

01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:18.550
Myself and Mr. Pink?

01:23:18.650 --> 01:23:22.750
You two take the manager
and make him give you the diamonds.

01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:24.950
We're there
for those stones, period.

01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:28.550
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:32.750
We're out in two minutes,
not one second longer.

01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:36.950
What if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:41.450
A store like this
is insured up the ass.

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:44.450
They're not supposed to give you
any resistance whatsoever.

01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:48.250
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...

01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:50.750
smash their nose with your gun.

01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:53.250
Drops him right to the floor.
Everyone jumps.

01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:56.350
He falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose.

01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:59.350
Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.

01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:02.950
Some bitch might
talk shit to you.

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:06.950
Give her a look like she's next.
Watch her shut the fuck up.

01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:10.750
If it's the manager,
that's different.

01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:13.150
The managers know not
to fuck around...

01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:15.450
so if he's giving you static...

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:19.750
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy
so you gotta that bastard in two.

01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:23.750
If he won't tell ya something,
cut off one of his fingers.

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:27.150
The little one.
Then tell him his thumb's next.

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:30.150
After that he'll tell you
if he wears ladies underwear.

01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:36.050
I'm hungry.
Let's get a taco.

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:52.650
Fuck.

01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:12.950
Jesus.

01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:15.250
I'm blind, man.
I'm fuckin' blind.

01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:17.750
No, you just got
blood in your eyes.

01:25:30.850 --> 01:25:32.250
Is he dead?

01:25:33.650 --> 01:25:35.550
Did he die or not?

01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:38.150
Let's go.

01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:15.150
Hold it! Get out!

01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:18.750
Get out of the fuckin' car!

01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:36.450
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Larry.

01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:39.450
I can't believe she killed me.

01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:41.050
Who'd have fucking thought that?

01:26:41.050 --> 01:26:43.750
Hey, just cancel that shit
right now.

01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:46.750
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad.

01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:48.550
But you ain't dying.

01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:52.850
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.

01:26:54.150 --> 01:26:56.050
I'm gonna die.
I know it.

01:27:31.150 --> 01:27:32.650
What the fuck happened?

01:27:32.650 --> 01:27:36.650
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:40.150
What? I didn't hear you.

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:41.650
I said...

01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:45.050
Blonde went crazy.

01:27:45.150 --> 01:27:50.450
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:51.750
This cop?

01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:58.850
He went crazy?
Something like that?

01:27:58.950 --> 01:28:01.050
Worse or better?

01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:04.350
Eddie, he was
pulling a burn, man.

01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:07.550
He was gonna kill
the cop and me.

01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:11.550
When you guys walked in, he was gonna
kill you and run with the diamonds.

01:28:12.150 --> 01:28:13.250
What'd I tell ya?

01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:16.850
That sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.

01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:20.150
You should've asked the cop,
not just killed him.

01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:23.950
He talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.

01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:27.150
I don't buy it.

01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:28.650
Doesn't make sense.

01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:35.450
Makes perfect fuckin' sense
to me.

01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:39.050
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.

01:28:39.150 --> 01:28:41.350
He's right.
The ear's hacked off.

01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:45.550
Let me just say this out loud,
'cause I wanna get this straight.

01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:48.550
You're saying that Mr. Blonde...

01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:49.750
was gonna kill you...

01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:53.050
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us...

01:28:53.050 --> 01:28:55.050
take the diamonds and scram.

01:28:55.050 --> 01:28:58.250
I'm right about that, right?
That's your story?

01:28:58.950 --> 01:29:00.850
I swear on my mother's soul...

01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:02.550
that's what happened.

01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:06.550
The man you killed
just got released from prison.

01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:09.650
He got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.

01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:12.350
He could've fuckin' walked.

01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:16.650
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.

01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:19.750
He did his fuckin' time
like a man.

01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:22.150
He did four years for us.

01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:24.650
So, Mr. Orange...

01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:27.750
you're telling me
that this good friend of mine...

01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:30.550
who did four years
for my father...

01:29:30.650 --> 01:29:35.550
who, in four years, never made a deal,
no matter what they offered him...

01:29:35.650 --> 01:29:38.750
you're telling me that
now that he's free...

01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:41.750
and we're making good
on our commitment to him...

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:46.450
he's just gonna decide,
out of the fucking blue...

01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:48.450
to rip us off?

01:29:50.150 --> 01:29:53.450
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:55.250
What the hell for?

01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:58.250
It'd just be more bullshit.

01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:02.450
This man set us up.

01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:06.750
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I don't know what's happening.

01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:10.550
- It's all right. I do.
- What are you talking about?

01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:14.350
That lump of shit's workin'
with the L.A.P.D.

01:30:15.650 --> 01:30:18.950
I don't have the slightest
fucking idea...

01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:20.450
what you're talking about.

01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:24.150
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:25.950
Like hell I am.

01:30:26.050 --> 01:30:29.150
Trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.

01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:30.950
He's a good kid.

01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:33.550
I understand
you're super-fuckin'-pissed.

01:30:33.650 --> 01:30:35.450
We're all real emotional.

01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:39.750
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know him. He wouldn't do that.

01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:41.350
You don't know jack shit!

01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:42.550
I do.

01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:44.550
The cocksucker
tipped off the cops...

01:30:44.650 --> 01:30:46.750
and got Mr. Brown
and Mr. Blue killed.

01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:49.850
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- Dead as Dillinger.

01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:51.950
How do you know all this?

01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:55.450
He was the only one
I wasn't 100 percent on.

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:58.750
I should have my head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

01:30:58.850 --> 01:31:02.650
- That's your proof?
- With instinct, you don't need proof.

01:31:02.650 --> 01:31:05.050
I ignored it before,
but no more.

01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:09.650
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:12.550
I'm not gonna let you make
a terrible mistake.

01:31:12.650 --> 01:31:15.550
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

01:31:15.650 --> 01:31:17.550
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

01:31:18.450 --> 01:31:20.350
Larry, look...

01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:22.350
it's been quite a long time.

01:31:22.450 --> 01:31:23.850
A lot of jobs.

01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:26.950
There's no need for this, man.

01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:29.450
Let's just put our guns down...

01:31:30.650 --> 01:31:32.350
and let's settle this...

01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:34.050
with a fucking conversation.

01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:37.550
Joe, if you kill that man,
you die next.

01:31:37.650 --> 01:31:39.850
Repeat: you kill him,
you die next.

01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:43.250
Larry, we have been friends.

01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:45.450
You respect my dad
and I respect you...

01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:47.450
but I'll put bullets
in you.

01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:49.850
You put that fuckin' gun
down now.

01:31:50.650 --> 01:31:52.950
Goddamn you, Joe...

01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:54.450
don't make me do this.

01:31:54.450 --> 01:31:57.150
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun
at my dad!

01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:45.850
I'm sorry, kid.

01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:50.150
Looks like we're gonna...

01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:53.450
do a little time.

01:33:59.950 --> 01:34:01.950
I'm a cop.

01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:05.650
Larry...

01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:08.850
I'm sorry.

01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:11.850
I'm...

01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:14.050
so sorry.

01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:19.350
I'm a cop.

01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:37.850
I'm sorry.

01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:51.050
I'm sorry.

01:34:52.650 --> 01:34:54.250
I'm...

01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:55.650
sorr--

01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:59.450
Freeze!

01:34:59.550 --> 01:35:01.550
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!

01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:03.550
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:06.450
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:09.750
- Drop the fucking gun!
- We're gonna blow you away!
