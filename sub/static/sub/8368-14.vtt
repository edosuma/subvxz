<i>McKenzie:</i>
<i>Previously on "Face Off"...</i>

00:04.805 --> 00:06.605
For your
final challenge,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.040
you'll be creating makeups

00:08.075 --> 00:10.809
that will star
in their very own horror film.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.411
- Wow.
- Yeah!

00:12.446 --> 00:14.213
- This is the lighting setup
we're thinking about.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.148
- My makeup looks beautiful.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.350
- Man, he's awesome.
- Such a cool experience.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.019
- It's too extreme.

00:20.054 --> 00:23.155
- This is my
worst-case scenario.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.289
<i>McKenzie:</i>
<i>And tonight...</i>

00:24.325 --> 00:25.391
<i>- I really want to win this</i>

00:25.426 --> 00:27.059
more than anything
in my entire life,

00:27.094 --> 00:31.330
because I want to build a future
with my wife and family.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.499
- I'm the youngest competitor
this season,

00:33.534 --> 00:35.200
but I know I have
what it takes

00:35.236 --> 00:37.803
to be the next
"Face Off" champion.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.204
<i>- If I can win "Face Off,"</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:42.241
I can pursue the career
that I've always wanted to do.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.510
I really, really,
really want this.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.178
- The winner
of "Face Off" is...

00:46.213 --> 00:49.214
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:54.520
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

00:54.555 --> 00:58.023
<i>¶ ¶</i>

00:58.059 --> 01:00.025
- Our director seemed very happy
fothr e most part,

01:00.061 --> 01:01.760
but just wants to tweak
some stuff.

01:01.796 --> 01:03.595
I'm really happy with how
our camera test went,

01:03.631 --> 01:06.565
<i>but this whole journey</i>
<i>has been exhausting.</i>

01:06.600 --> 01:09.134
I'm creatively depleted,
I'm missing my family,

01:09.170 --> 01:10.602
but this is the finale.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.071
I mean, I got to bring it.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.373
Sounds like you have the least
amount of changes of anyone.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.742
- I still have a lot to add,
'cause I want more.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.477
But I was happy
with yesterday.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.479
It's a good feeling
coming from the camera test,

01:20.514 --> 01:22.047
<i>knowing that I don't have</i>
<i>to start over anything.</i>

01:22.083 --> 01:24.483
<i>I can just keep</i>
<i>moving forward with it.</i>

01:24.518 --> 01:26.318
- You?
- I have a lot to do.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.820
<i>After the camera test,</i>

01:27.855 --> 01:30.989
<i>we have to redesign</i>
<i>both faces from scratch,</i>

01:31.025 --> 01:32.891
<i>resculpt the demon cowl,</i>

01:32.927 --> 01:35.260
<i>and sculpt</i>
<i>the shoulder appliances.</i>

01:35.296 --> 01:36.995
And I'm afraid
that we won't get it done.

01:37.031 --> 01:39.398
<i>¶ ¶</i>

01:39.433 --> 01:43.235
- What?
- Oh, [bleep].

01:43.270 --> 01:45.003
<i>'sIt my son and my husband.</i>

01:45.039 --> 01:47.039
I am completely shocked.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.941
- And you're crying.
- I am.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.709
- Hi.
- I'm so proud of you.

01:50.744 --> 01:51.977
- It's my parents!

01:52.012 --> 01:54.680
<i>It's so nice to see them.</i>

01:54.715 --> 01:55.848
- Hi, baby.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.583
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.418
So exciting for my wife
to be here.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.853
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.287
- Hi.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.623
- It's so emotional
to be with our families again.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.492
- Oh, I missed you so much.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.827
- And I missed you too.

02:08.863 --> 02:10.062
<i>- Been really,</i>
<i>really difficult</i>

02:10.097 --> 02:12.231
not being able
to talk to them fosor  long.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.732
How long are you here?

02:13.767 --> 02:14.900
- Until the finale.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.468
- So you're gonna be
at thein fale?

02:16.504 --> 02:17.903
- Uh-huh.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.172
<i>- Knowing that she's supporting</i>
<i>me at the finale,</i>

02:20.207 --> 02:22.407
<i>is gonna push me harder</i>
<i>to win.</i>

02:22.443 --> 02:24.676
- You're in the lab.
- I know.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.245
- This is where
the magic happens.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.446
- It is.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.948
- I sculpted
meso pretty cool stuff.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.750
- [sighs]
I can't wait to see.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.752
- My parents are definitely
a big part of the reason

02:33.787 --> 02:35.020
<i>why I'm even here.</i>

02:35.055 --> 02:36.121
<i>They have encouraged me</i>

02:36.157 --> 02:38.757
my entire time
in this business.

02:38.792 --> 02:42.194
So, in a big way,
me winning this competition

02:42.229 --> 02:44.029
would be me winning it
for them.

02:44.064 --> 02:48.133
- I know I'm just the mom,
but I think you're talented.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.568
- Maybe just a little bit.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.637
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.606
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.409
- Did they tell you
what I'm doing here?

02:57.444 --> 02:59.311
We're making a little movie,

02:59.346 --> 03:02.814
and I have to make the monsters
for the movie.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.316
- Okay.
- Yeah?

03:04.351 --> 03:05.484
[laughs]

03:05.519 --> 03:07.119
<i>My family's my everything.</i>

03:07.154 --> 03:09.421
It's the motivation
I really needed

03:09.456 --> 03:10.756
<i>to do my best.</i>

03:10.791 --> 03:13.759
- Say, "Good luck, Mom."

03:13.794 --> 03:16.028
- Oh, sweetie,
I am so proud of you.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.062
- Thank you.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.063
<i>¶ ¶</i>

03:18.098 --> 03:20.866
- I love you.
- I love you.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.869
- It's definitely hard
to go from that

03:23.904 --> 03:26.038
to wanting to work again,

03:26.073 --> 03:28.373
<i>but I know that $100,000</i>
<i>is on the line</i>

03:28.409 --> 03:31.843
<i>and I got to</i>
<i>get back into it.</i>

03:33.547 --> 03:34.613
- You're gonna sculpt
the possession face.

03:34.614 --> 03:35.680
I'm gonna sculpt this face,
and we're gonna do that now.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.815
- Okay.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.116
<i>- Bryce wanted</i>
<i>the possession makeup</i>

03:38.152 --> 03:39.718
<i>to have a different anatomy.</i>

03:39.753 --> 03:43.922
<i>So I'm having Anna sculpt more</i>
<i>simple version of the face.</i>

03:43.958 --> 03:45.791
<i>And because Bryce</i>
<i>had a lot of things</i>

03:45.826 --> 03:48.393
<i>that he wanted to change</i>
<i>for the demon face,</i>

03:48.429 --> 03:50.729
<i>I'm getting rid</i>
<i>of the horn on the nose</i>

03:50.764 --> 03:53.966
<i>and going with more of a sleek</i>
<i>design with slits in it,</i>

03:54.001 --> 03:57.035
<i>and then Kaleb will be working</i>
<i>the shoulder piece.</i>

03:57.071 --> 03:58.837
We need to do
an extreme amount of work

03:58.872 --> 04:01.640
<i>in a very short amount</i>
<i>of time.</i>

04:01.675 --> 04:05.477
<i>¶ ¶</i>

04:05.512 --> 04:07.479
<i>- After the camera test,</i>
<i>we have a ton to do.</i>

04:07.514 --> 04:09.948
John wants more with Sam,

04:09.984 --> 04:12.584
<i>so we're scrapping</i>
<i>the trauma makeup with his eye,</i>

04:12.620 --> 04:15.687
<i>and instead, making more</i>
<i>of this disease makeup,</i>

04:15.723 --> 04:18.156
<i>which we will have sticks</i>
<i>coming out of.</i>

04:18.192 --> 04:20.592
<i>Johnny takes</i>
<i>the arm prosthetics for Sam,</i>

04:20.628 --> 04:22.828
<i>and for the demon,</i>
<i>John wants a scar</i>

04:22.863 --> 04:24.129
right in the middle
of his forehead.

04:24.164 --> 04:27.466
<i>So Yvonne</i>
<i>is sculpting thapit ece.</i>

04:27.501 --> 04:31.737
<i>I just hope we can find</i>
<i>a way to get everything done.</i>

04:31.772 --> 04:33.972
<i>¶ ¶</i>

04:34.008 --> 04:35.540
- [laughing]
Do you need help?

04:35.576 --> 04:36.742
[laughing]

04:36.777 --> 04:37.876
- He's going in two.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.411
I'm in a really good place,

04:39.446 --> 04:41.880
<i>'cause I don't have</i>
<i>toet rrace any of my steps.</i>

04:41.915 --> 04:45.417
<i>I'm just adding to an already</i>
<i>really good makeup.</i>

04:45.452 --> 04:46.852
It's definitely an advantage,

04:46.887 --> 04:49.421
<i>because while the other artists</i>
<i>are busy resculpting,</i>

04:49.456 --> 04:51.089
<i>I get to work</i>
<i>on the full torso.</i>

04:51.125 --> 04:53.158
<i>That'll add to my character.</i>

04:53.193 --> 04:55.294
<i>Mel gets</i>
<i>the texture plates going,</i>

04:55.329 --> 04:58.463
and I have Robert
working on the teeth.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.865
[machine whirring]

04:59.900 --> 05:05.437
<i>¶ ¶</i>

05:05.472 --> 05:07.439
<i>- Once I get all of the forms</i>
<i>blocked out,</i>

05:07.474 --> 05:10.042
I start adding wrinkles
and cracking

05:10.077 --> 05:11.376
<i>to give it that dry look.</i>

05:11.412 --> 05:12.678
<i>At the same time,</i>

05:12.713 --> 05:16.481
<i>Kaleb and Anna finish sculpting</i>
<i>their pieces.</i>

05:16.517 --> 05:17.649
Thank you.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.786
And then we all go back
to get the stuff molded.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.922
I just hope
everything goes well.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.791
<i>¶ ¶</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:27.192
- Time is ticking away,

05:27.227 --> 05:30.996
and we manage to get our
sculptures in really good shape.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.965
And now we're tag-teaming
to get all our molds finished,

05:34.001 --> 05:37.869
and I just hope that John
is happy with what we've done.

05:37.905 --> 05:45.911
<i>¶ ¶</i>

05:50.451 --> 05:53.418
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

05:53.454 --> 05:57.489
<i>¶ ¶</i>

05:57.524 --> 05:59.257
- All right.
Whoo!

05:59.293 --> 06:00.792
- We got it.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.128
<i>- We pull up to the mansion</i>
<i>where we're filming,</i>

06:03.163 --> 06:04.763
and it's crazy.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.031
<i>People are just everywhere.</i>

06:06.066 --> 06:07.632
<i>I've never seen</i>
<i>anything like it before.</i>

06:07.668 --> 06:10.635
<i>And there's this</i>
<i>gigantic makeup trailer,</i>

06:10.671 --> 06:13.338
and I'm just super pumped.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.706
<i>The first thing I want to do</i>

06:14.742 --> 06:16.908
<i>is run the demon's second foot</i>
<i>in poly foam</i>

06:16.944 --> 06:19.277
<i>because we didn't get a chance</i>
<i>to do it at the lab,</i>

06:19.313 --> 06:20.712
and it's gonna
look really wonky

06:20.748 --> 06:22.681
if we only have one foot
on our guy.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.116
<i>While I'm doing that,</i>

06:24.151 --> 06:25.317
<i>Johnny is gonna take the lead</i>

06:25.352 --> 06:27.119
<i>on applying</i>
<i>the possession makeup,</i>

06:27.154 --> 06:30.555
<i>and Yvonne is going to start</i>
<i>applying our demon character.</i>

06:30.591 --> 06:33.625
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:33.660 --> 06:36.928
- I have 11 appliances
to apply,

06:36.964 --> 06:38.330
<i>and in the camera test,</i>

06:38.365 --> 06:40.332
<i>he was starting to kind of</i>
<i>sweat the pieces off,</i>

06:40.367 --> 06:43.869
<i>so I'm using Telesis</i>
<i>mixed with zinc oxide,</i>

06:43.904 --> 06:45.203
<i>which is an antiperspirant,</i>

06:45.239 --> 06:46.905
<i>so it should keep him</i>
<i>from sweating,</i>

06:46.940 --> 06:49.341
at least in those spots.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.710
- They came out.
We have feet.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.246
After I finish running
poly foam for the foot,

06:54.281 --> 06:56.882
<i>I jump on to the demon</i>
<i>character with Yvonne.</i>

06:56.917 --> 06:58.850
<i>We try to quickly finish</i>
<i>getting everything down</i>

06:58.886 --> 07:01.686
<i>and stk ucon really good.</i>

07:01.722 --> 07:02.921
And now it's time to paint.

07:02.956 --> 07:06.124
<i>¶ ¶</i>

07:06.160 --> 07:08.493
<i>I'm bouncing back and forth</i>
<i>between both makeups,</i>

07:08.529 --> 07:10.462
<i>trying to coordinate</i>
<i>and get things done,</i>

07:10.497 --> 07:11.997
and it's like,
go, go, go, go, go.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.231
- 15 minutes.

07:13.267 --> 07:20.205
<i>¶ ¶</i>

07:20.240 --> 07:21.540
- That's time, everybody.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.741
<i>We did it,</i>

07:22.776 --> 07:24.609
and the characters
look awesome in real life,

07:24.645 --> 07:26.311
<i>but the real test</i>
<i>is coming up--</i>

07:26.346 --> 07:28.447
<i>to see how they look on film,</i>

07:28.482 --> 07:30.282
and, God,
I hope they look good.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.484
All right,
oily people in first.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.586
<i>This is what "Face Off"</i>
<i>is all about.</i>

07:34.621 --> 07:36.822
<i>I fought my way</i>
<i>into the final three.</i>

07:36.857 --> 07:39.391
And it all comes down to this.

07:39.426 --> 07:46.765
<i>¶ ¶</i>

07:46.800 --> 07:48.099
<i>This is my first time on set.</i>

07:48.135 --> 07:49.501
So, while I'm very excited
for this,

07:49.536 --> 07:52.237
<i>at the same time,</i>
<i>I'm super nervous.</i>

07:52.272 --> 07:53.672
- Oh, my God.
- All right.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.907
- There it is!
- All right!

07:55.943 --> 07:57.175
- Oh!
- Look at you.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.376
- Oh!
- I'm digging it.

07:58.412 --> 07:59.845
Give me a hug, baby.
Come on.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.314
- Our director, Johnan, d the
judges are, like, right there.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.583
I just really hope
that they're all happy

08:04.618 --> 08:05.584
with what we've done.

08:05.619 --> 08:08.153
- This way, guys.
- All right.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.255
<i>[ominous music]</i>

08:10.290 --> 08:12.057
- Let's get you guys inside.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.191
And watch your feet
as you go in.

08:13.227 --> 08:14.559
It's a little tight
in here, okay?

08:14.595 --> 08:16.661
- The first thing we're shooting
is the possessed makeup.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.029
Oh, my God.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.365
And we're filming
a nighttime scene

08:20.400 --> 08:21.433
in the middle of the day.

08:21.468 --> 08:22.901
- You look up.
You see her.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.202
<i>- It's really amazing.</i>

08:24.238 --> 08:25.904
I hope it goes well.
[laughs]

08:25.939 --> 08:27.639
- Melissa, come with me.
- Yes.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.508
- And then we can see it
on the monitor, okay?

08:29.543 --> 08:30.775
- Okay.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.143
- 1-7.
Take one.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.645
- Action.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.715
<i>[sinister music]</i>

08:36.750 --> 08:37.916
- Help me!
- See here?

08:37.951 --> 08:39.918
A little bit of sheeonn  him
will help.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.653
<i>- Seeing my makeup on camera</i>

08:41.688 --> 08:43.488
is really amazing to watch.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.956
<i>But John immediately asked us</i>

08:44.992 --> 08:46.558
<i>to add more shine</i>
<i>on the character,</i>

08:46.593 --> 08:48.493
<i>so it looks like</i>
<i>it's glistening.</i>

08:48.529 --> 08:50.028
<i>It's really high pressure,</i>

08:50.063 --> 08:52.230
and I'm just trying
to do the best job I can.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.965
- Take two.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.700
- Action.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.036
<i>[upbeat electronic music]</i>

08:58.071 --> 09:00.005
- Help, help, please.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.308
- That little bit of sweat gloss
added to his shoulders--

09:03.343 --> 09:04.976
- Yeah.
- That's nice.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.478
- That's great.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.113
It's awesome.
That's it, that's it.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.814
- Oh!
- Yes, yes, yes!

09:09.850 --> 09:11.650
- Oh, yeah!
- Camera cuts!

09:11.685 --> 09:13.084
Camera cuts!
Let's move on!

09:13.120 --> 09:15.320
- John seems very happy
with the possessed charaerct,

09:15.355 --> 09:16.388
<i>which is a huge relief.</i>

09:16.423 --> 09:17.889
- That was
a fantastic job, guys.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.559
All right, let's reset.
Let's move on from this setup.

09:20.594 --> 09:21.893
- Oh, my God.
That was [bleep] awesome.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.528
Now it's time for our demon.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.996
<i>And it's very nerve-racking</i>

09:25.032 --> 09:28.466
because he is the
central character in our story.

09:28.502 --> 09:29.935
- Uh, Melissa,
can we make his eye area

09:29.970 --> 09:32.871
a little more gooey too?
- Okay.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.306
Oh, it's so gross.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.308
- 1-7 frame.
Take one.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.976
- Action.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.011
Really clench those arms.
Yeah.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.414
Feel it.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.317
And release your mouth.
Open it up.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.519
Yes!

09:47.554 --> 09:49.521
- [whispering]
So scary!

09:49.556 --> 09:51.656
- So I got to admit, it's
a pretty cool-looking cyclops.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.558
<i>- They seem to have really hit</i>

09:53.594 --> 09:55.927
the right notes
for the director.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.396
<i>- To see this character</i>
<i>and know that I made it,</i>

09:58.432 --> 10:01.433
it's beyond what
I could have imagined.

10:01.468 --> 10:05.570
- Camera cuts.
Great job, dude.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.739
You happy?
It looks fantastic.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.174
<i>- This is absolutely crazy.</i>

10:09.209 --> 10:12.510
It's my first time on set,
and it's insane.

10:12.546 --> 10:14.746
I'm so glad
that I have this opportunity.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.081
It's super cool

10:16.116 --> 10:17.749
<i>to see the makeup</i>
<i>on the monitor.</i>

10:17.784 --> 10:19.651
<i>It's so cool to see, like, them</i>
<i>as they are meant to be seen,</i>

10:19.686 --> 10:21.953
<i>as the director is seeing them</i>
<i>in his head.</i>

10:21.989 --> 10:24.556
Team Badass.
- Team Badass.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.025
<i>[laughter]</i>

10:30.339 --> 10:33.307
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

10:33.342 --> 10:38.545
<i>¶ ¶</i>

10:38.581 --> 10:40.214
<i>- It's the day</i>
<i>of our film shoot.</i>

10:40.249 --> 10:41.281
Come on.

10:41.317 --> 10:42.516
We get to our makeup trailer.

10:42.551 --> 10:44.318
<i>We have five hours</i>
<i>of application,</i>

10:44.353 --> 10:46.253
and this is it.

10:46.288 --> 10:47.988
Okay, let's do this.

10:48.024 --> 10:50.791
I am extremely excited,
but at the same time,

10:50.826 --> 10:52.326
<i>I am terrified.</i>

10:52.361 --> 10:55.095
It's a roller coaster
of emotion.

10:55.131 --> 10:56.497
- You guys ready?

10:58.467 --> 11:00.334
<i>- Anna will be applying</i>
<i>the possession makpeu</i>

11:00.369 --> 11:01.535
and painting most of it.

11:01.570 --> 11:03.103
- Well, today
we're gonna bald-cap you,

11:03.139 --> 11:04.171
and you're gonna have a wig.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.939
- Anna knows horror.

11:05.975 --> 11:07.775
<i>And she's really good</i>
<i>at application.</i>

11:07.810 --> 11:09.143
Pull these up a little bit.

11:09.178 --> 11:10.978
<i>And because there aren't</i>
<i>that many pieces</i>

11:11.013 --> 11:12.146
for the possession makeup,

11:12.181 --> 11:13.814
<i>I'm having her focus</i>
<i>on making sure</i>

11:13.849 --> 11:16.083
everything is blended down
perfectly.

11:16.118 --> 11:17.851
- Do you want me to pluck more
on this side?

11:17.887 --> 11:19.286
- That's good.
- Okay.

11:19.321 --> 11:20.621
<i>I want to do a great job.</i>

11:20.656 --> 11:22.423
I really want Rob to succeed.

11:22.458 --> 11:25.225
I want to see these makeups
look gorgeous

11:25.261 --> 11:29.830
and terrifying and amazing
on film.

11:29.865 --> 11:32.433
- For the demon,
Kaleb and I will be applying

11:32.468 --> 11:34.334
<i>all the pieces</i>
<i>as fast as we can,</i>

11:34.370 --> 11:37.371
and hopefully that leaves
us  time to paint both makeups.

11:37.406 --> 11:40.541
<i>¶ ¶</i>

11:40.576 --> 11:41.942
We're gonna test-fit
everything.

11:41.977 --> 11:45.846
I want to do an oil tear-drop
gag for the face,

11:45.881 --> 11:48.982
and I have to figure it out
before it goes on my model.

11:49.018 --> 11:50.517
<i>I'm running the tubing</i>

11:50.553 --> 11:52.786
<i>up the centeofr  his forehead</i>
<i>and down the back of his head,</i>

11:52.822 --> 11:56.056
<i>and then the model will</i>
<i>pump oil through the tubing</i>

11:56.092 --> 12:00.227
so it looks like
he's crying oil.

12:00.262 --> 12:04.832
<i>¶ ¶</i>

12:04.867 --> 12:07.968
<i>Kaleb and I finally get all</i>
<i>the stuff applied to the demon,</i>

12:08.003 --> 12:10.237
but now
time is getting away from us.

12:10.272 --> 12:13.807
Make sure, like, all of this
around it is glued down.

12:13.843 --> 12:17.077
We still have to glue down
their eye edges and mouth edges,

12:17.113 --> 12:18.278
finish painting everything...

12:18.314 --> 12:20.848
Why is there so much pink
on his neck?

12:20.883 --> 12:23.183
<i>Add moss,</i>
<i>add the demon's teeth,</i>

12:23.219 --> 12:26.153
and we have to add a tllhe oil
to bring everything together.

12:26.188 --> 12:34.461
<i>¶ ¶</i>

12:34.497 --> 12:35.996
That's time.

12:36.031 --> 12:40.234
Time's up, and these makeups
look so cool.

12:40.269 --> 12:41.335
We cut it close, guys.

12:41.370 --> 12:43.237
We cut it a little close.
- We really did.

12:43.272 --> 12:44.371
- But at the same time,

12:44.406 --> 12:45.906
<i>I was happy</i>
<i>before the camera test,</i>

12:45.941 --> 12:48.275
<i>and that turned out</i>
<i>to be a complete disaster.</i>

12:48.310 --> 12:51.211
So, at this point,
it could go either way.

12:51.247 --> 12:59.253
<i>¶ ¶</i>

13:02.691 --> 13:03.824
- Oh, my goodness.

13:03.859 --> 13:05.592
- Ooh.
- He's gonna be a mess.

13:05.628 --> 13:07.995
- The oil demon.

13:08.030 --> 13:09.630
- Ooh.
- Awesome.

13:09.665 --> 13:10.764
<i>- When we get to set,</i>

13:10.799 --> 13:12.833
this is when all the nerves
kick in for me.

13:12.868 --> 13:14.234
- Hi.
- Hello, there.

13:14.270 --> 13:16.803
- Hi, guys.
- How's this working?

13:16.839 --> 13:18.906
I'm the youngest competitor
this season,

13:18.941 --> 13:21.542
<i>so it's definitely</i>
<i>a newer experience,</i>

13:21.577 --> 13:24.278
and being on a set
is a little nerve-racking.

13:24.313 --> 13:26.280
- You are a terrifying SOB.

13:26.315 --> 13:27.548
Let's go shoot this.

13:27.583 --> 13:35.055
<i>¶ ¶</i>

13:35.090 --> 13:38.458
- We're shooting our
demon character's scene first.

13:38.494 --> 13:40.194
<i>We're adding</i>
al<i> l the last-minute details,</i>

13:40.229 --> 13:43.096
<i>like the dust and the dirt,</i>
<i>and immediately,</i>

13:43.132 --> 13:46.266
the pressure's really up
because this has to go well.

13:46.302 --> 13:49.369
- Maybe right as you rise,
it's a little t biof a shudder,

13:49.405 --> 13:51.471
something that's gonna, like,
release that dust on the air.

13:51.507 --> 13:52.472
- Okay.

13:52.508 --> 13:54.908
- We also have to do
the oil gag.

13:54.944 --> 13:56.543
This gag has to work.

13:56.579 --> 13:59.313
- Whene  hstands up,
just hit him with it.

13:59.348 --> 14:00.781
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:00.816 --> 14:02.482
- If it doesn't work, Bryce
will be really disappointed,

14:02.518 --> 14:04.151
and I don't want that
to happen.

14:04.186 --> 14:05.886
- Okay, are we ready?
Let's do this.

14:05.921 --> 14:07.554
- Scene 10 apple.
Take one.

14:07.590 --> 14:09.623
- And action.

14:09.658 --> 14:17.664
<i>¶ ¶</i>

14:18.834 --> 14:21.034
- Thank God
that it looks really cool.

14:21.070 --> 14:22.869
<i>Like, you can see the oil</i>
<i>dripping down his face,</i>

14:22.905 --> 14:24.438
<i>like, out of his eyes.</i>

14:24.473 --> 14:26.173
- Okay, that's cut.
Let's cut and reset.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.609
It looks so good.
- Hold that.

14:28.644 --> 14:30.110
<i>It's a really cool effect,</i>

14:30.145 --> 14:32.145
and it's definitely
a big relief.

14:32.181 --> 14:34.281
<i>- Look at all the goo</i>
<i>coming out of his eyeballs.</i>

14:34.316 --> 14:35.349
<i>- Nice.</i>

14:35.384 --> 14:36.850
- When it stands up
into the light

14:36.885 --> 14:39.386
and the light is swinging at
the same time, it's beautiful.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.088
- I want you guys to see
how good that looked.

14:41.123 --> 14:43.357
It looks so good.

14:43.392 --> 14:44.625
- [laughing]
Oh, my God.

14:44.660 --> 14:46.827
- That last lunge
made my heart stop.

14:46.862 --> 14:48.862
I think it's great.

14:48.897 --> 14:50.797
<i>- The possession makeup</i>
<i>is up next.</i>

14:50.833 --> 14:52.933
And it's just as important
that it looks great.

14:52.968 --> 14:54.568
- Let's just, like, loosen up
her hair a little bit,

14:54.603 --> 14:55.769
get some water in there,

14:55.804 --> 14:57.170
and then we're gonna put her
in place.

14:57.206 --> 14:58.805
- We have to maintain
a lot of oil for her.

14:58.841 --> 14:59.940
- Close your eyes for now.

14:59.975 --> 15:01.441
<i>- When the oil dries out,</i>

15:01.477 --> 15:03.143
it gets really hard and sticky,

15:03.178 --> 15:05.479
<i>so we have to</i>
<i>keep her hair moist,</i>

15:05.514 --> 15:06.913
and then for her mouth...

15:06.949 --> 15:08.382
Take a swig.

15:08.417 --> 15:12.019
<i>We have to reset the oil</i>
<i>dripping out before each shot.</i>

15:12.054 --> 15:13.787
It's a lot of stress.

15:13.822 --> 15:16.123
- Okay, here we go.
Roll camera, please.

15:16.158 --> 15:18.725
- 10 Carly.
Take one, mark.

15:18.761 --> 15:19.960
- Action.

15:19.995 --> 15:23.964
<i>¶ ¶</i>

15:23.999 --> 15:26.366
- You shouldn't have come here.

15:26.402 --> 15:28.535
- Oh, my God.

15:28.570 --> 15:30.103
- That is so scary.

15:30.139 --> 15:31.738
- Rob!

15:31.774 --> 15:34.007
- Okay, cut, cut. We got it.
We got it. That was great.

15:34.043 --> 15:36.610
- It feels like
Japanese horror ghost

15:36.645 --> 15:38.211
and making it more featureless

15:38.247 --> 15:39.946
just increases
the creep factor.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.049
- The both of them really
work well together.

15:42.084 --> 15:44.851
They resemble each other.
That's so cool.

15:44.887 --> 15:46.953
- I'm feeling--
I'm feeling good.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.089
I'm feeling good.
- We so excited.

15:49.124 --> 15:50.223
- Yeah!

15:50.259 --> 15:51.725
- I think today
went really well.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.060
<i>The makeups held up.</i>

15:53.095 --> 15:55.162
<i>I'm happy. My team is happy.</i>
<i>Bryce is happy.</i>

15:55.197 --> 15:56.663
<i>I know everyone says it,</i>

15:56.699 --> 15:58.298
<i>but I really couldn't have</i>
<i>asked for a better team.</i>

15:58.334 --> 16:00.801
I'm really hoping
that the judges love my makeup

16:00.836 --> 16:01.802
as much as I do.

16:01.837 --> 16:03.236
- I love the makpseu.

16:03.272 --> 16:06.807
I think they looked terrifying
and amazing and gorgeous.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.075
And I'm so excited.

16:08.110 --> 16:09.509
- All good words,
algol od words.

16:09.545 --> 16:12.979
The entire competition as
a whole has just felt surreal.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.748
<i>It's been</i>
<i>such a cool experience,</i>

16:14.783 --> 16:16.917
<i>and I feel like I've grown</i>
<i>so much as an artist.</i>

16:16.952 --> 16:20.620
<i>This is probably the</i>
<i>best creature I've ever made.</i>

16:20.656 --> 16:23.156
- I'm so glad
that you picked us.

16:23.192 --> 16:25.292
<i>- I am very proud of myself</i>
<i>and my team,</i>

16:25.327 --> 16:27.194
and I really hope win.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.394
- A-team.
- Yeah.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.464
- It's the day of my film shoot,
and I'm extremely pumped.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.333
<i>¶ ¶</i>

16:42.369 --> 16:43.968
<i>I love our concept.</i>

16:44.004 --> 16:47.472
I cannot wait to get this going
and try and win $100,000.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.440

16:49.476 --> 16:51.042

16:51.077 --> 16:52.410
- Hello, hello.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.545
- Today I'm just gonna tackle
most of the demon.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.948
<i>Mel is working</i>
<i>on the possessed makeup,</i>

16:56.983 --> 16:58.716

17:03.123 --> 17:05.757
It was really cool to sculpt
all of these extra things.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.426
<i>But now I have to find a way</i>
<i>to get everything applied</i>

17:08.461 --> 17:10.028
and paint it before time is up.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.031
<i>¶ ¶</i>

17:13.066 --> 17:14.699
- For the camera test,
I was really bummed out

17:14.734 --> 17:17.602
because I overpainted
the possessed makeup.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.338
<i>It grayed very quickly,</i>
<i>and in trying to bring it back,</i>

17:20.373 --> 17:22.140
I ripped up a lot of edges,

17:22.175 --> 17:25.209
so I'm hoping to dodge
a lot of those same mistakes

17:25.245 --> 17:27.345
<i>in today's application.</i>

17:27.380 --> 17:29.247
Walter, are you okay
with this?

17:29.282 --> 17:30.448
- Yeah, that looks good.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.383
<i>¶ ¶</i>

17:32.419 --> 17:35.853
I'm loving the application,
but we still have a lot to do.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.022
Just get the edges
and then get the Aquacolor,

17:38.058 --> 17:39.457
and you can go in
with Aquacolor too.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.759
<i>Therise  a lot</i>
<i>of real estate to paint.</i>

17:41.795 --> 17:44.529
And there's
so many little details.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.964
<i>Sponging, flicking,</i>
<i>airbrushing,</i>

17:47.000 --> 17:49.667
<i>adding different vines,</i>
<i>the little foam pieces,</i>

17:49.702 --> 17:51.202
putting a little bit
of moss on there,

17:51.237 --> 17:53.171
<i>making sure</i>
<i>that these two makeups</i>

17:53.206 --> 17:55.706
<i>are as camera-ready</i>
<i>as possible.</i>

17:55.742 --> 17:56.908
<i>¶ ¶</i>

17:56.943 --> 17:59.310
All right, guys,
that's time.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.312
I am extremely excited.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.980
<i>I love my demon character.</i>

18:03.016 --> 18:04.615
Yeah, that looks cool.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.950
I can't wait to get him
out there

18:05.985 --> 18:07.652
and see what he's gonna do
in front of the camera.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.787
- Whoa, be so careful!
- Oh, [bleep].

18:09.823 --> 18:17.128
<i>¶ ¶</i>

18:17.163 --> 18:20.698
<i>- I pull up to set on this</i>
<i>extremely cool location,</i>

18:20.733 --> 18:23.634
<i>and I'm so eager</i>
<i>to get these makeups on film.</i>

18:23.670 --> 18:24.969
- Whoa.
- Oh, my goodness.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.604
- Wow.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.539
- Look at that.
- Nice.

18:28.575 --> 18:29.941
- What's up, guys?

18:29.976 --> 18:34.278
- I couldn't be more excited
to see what Ryan thinks.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.646
It's about to go down.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.548
- Let's go inside,
and let's make some movies.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.683
- Cool.
- Cool.

18:38.718 --> 18:39.750
- Let's do it.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.052
<i>- We jump right into it</i>

18:41.087 --> 18:43.187
and start off
with the possession makeup.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.555
- You guys ready?
- Ready, man.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.057
- Is there something else
you see that you want?

18:46.092 --> 18:47.492
- Yeah, let's just go
a little bit--

18:47.527 --> 18:48.926
a little bit on the teeth.
- Okay.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.862
I think she should just swig
a little bit and spit it out.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.263
- Okay.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.398
- I want to be with my makeup
the entire time.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.201
<i>I want to make sure my makpeu</i>
<i>is on point</i>

18:57.237 --> 19:00.638
<i>and also take care of</i>
<i>whatever Ryan needs.</i>

19:00.673 --> 19:01.939
- ahYe.
- Okay.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.174
- I think we'rree ady.
- All right, here we go.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.943
Roll camera, please.
- Scene 8, take one, mark.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.378
- And action.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.147
- Martha!

19:09.182 --> 19:10.481
Martha!

19:10.517 --> 19:12.783
[screaming andru gnting]

19:12.819 --> 19:14.385
Baby, what do I do?

19:14.420 --> 19:15.987
- [whispering indistinctly]

19:16.022 --> 19:18.589
- What?

19:18.625 --> 19:19.857
- Pull.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.259
- No!

19:21.294 --> 19:22.627
- Cut.
Great.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.462
Great, guys.
- Good with her?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.763
- Yeah, it looks awesome.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.499
- I kind of like how the vines
play underneath the skin,

19:30.436 --> 19:31.402
where it's pushed up
on the side  tofhe face.

19:31.403 --> 19:32.369
It definitely helpsw the vines
integrate itath the skin,

19:32.405 --> 19:33.938
instead of just being
a couple of sticks

19:33.973 --> 19:35.473
wrapped around her head.
both: Mm-hmm.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.841
- I think they really
capitalized

19:36.876 --> 19:39.577
on giving a static makeup

19:39.612 --> 19:41.479
some animation
built into the sculpture,

19:41.514 --> 19:42.980
'cause it does feel
like this vine

19:43.016 --> 19:46.017
is diving in
and out of her flesh.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.919
- Do wnee ed his snapping vine?
- Yeah.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.254
<i>It's time for the demon shot,</i>

19:50.290 --> 19:51.989
and big boy's gonna step in,

19:52.025 --> 19:53.824
and I'm extremely excited
about it.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.959
- Let me ask you this.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.894
How do you guys
feel about...

19:56.930 --> 19:59.197
putting some actual dirt
on the makeup?

19:59.232 --> 20:00.598
- Yeah.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.533
Ryan has this great idea.
He wants to throw dirt on it.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.802
<i>So, when he gets up,</i>
<i>dirt falls off the makeup,</i>

20:04.837 --> 20:06.470
creating a steamy mist.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.572
- Action.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.575
<i>[heavy rock music]</i>

20:10.610 --> 20:13.878
<i>¶ ¶</i>

20:13.913 --> 20:16.214
<i>He is looking</i>
<i>extremely massive.</i>

20:16.249 --> 20:17.915
<i>It's exactly</i>
<i>how I imagined it.</i>

20:17.951 --> 20:20.351
<i>And I believe</i>
<i>that I have the biggest,</i>

20:20.386 --> 20:21.752
<i>the most terrifying,</i>

20:21.788 --> 20:24.422
and the most advanced makeup
in the finale,

20:24.457 --> 20:27.558
and I feel fantastic about it.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.727
- Oh, that looks rad.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.529
That looks rad
in those lights.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.464
- I really love the way
that lichen

20:33.499 --> 20:35.299
and all that stuff
they have glued all over him

20:35.335 --> 20:36.767
picks up that blue light.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.237
It looks like it's luminescent.
- Yeah.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.504
- You're "likin'" it?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.039
- I'm "likin'" it.
- "Likin'" it.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.041
- I'm "likin'" it.
That's right.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.209
- Cut.
Awesome.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.378
Perfect, guys.
That's a wrap for Terry.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.848
[cheers and applause]

20:50.883 --> 20:52.450
<i>- We're done with my demon.</i>

20:52.485 --> 20:54.418
<i>I'm thrilled</i>
<i>with how things went.</i>

20:54.454 --> 20:56.520
<i>Watching it come</i>
<i>to life on the monitor,</i>

20:56.556 --> 20:57.521
it was exciting.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.589
It was really cool.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.826
I want a monster hug, dude
. Yeah!

21:01.861 --> 21:03.661
[laughs]

21:03.696 --> 21:04.895
<i>And I couldn't</i>
<i>have done anything</i>

21:04.931 --> 21:06.731
without Mel,
without Robert.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.766
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.468
<i>And I owe them everything.</i>

21:10.503 --> 21:12.903
<i>I think I did more work</i>
<i>than anyone.</i>

21:12.939 --> 21:14.572
<i>It is definitely</i>
<i>the best makeup I've done</i>

21:14.607 --> 21:16.641
<i>since I've been here,</i>
<i>so I hope I win.</i>

21:16.676 --> 21:19.143
It would mean
the absolute world to me,

21:19.178 --> 21:20.411
and it would change my life.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.314
Thank you so much, man.
You did great.

21:23.349 --> 21:24.315
Thank you very much.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.950
Thanks, man.

Those pants.

<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:38.698 --> 21:40.431
- Welcome, everyone.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.366
How did it feel
for you guys to be on set?

21:42.402 --> 21:44.235
- That was amazing.
- Really cool.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.703
- Little crazy.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.439
- Well, congratulations again
to all three of you.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.709
Now, just as a reminder
of what is on the line tonight,

21:51.744 --> 21:54.178
this season's champion will win

21:54.213 --> 21:58.783
<i>a VIP trip to one of Kryolan's</i>
<i>85 international locations,</i>

21:58.818 --> 22:02.420
<i>a 2016 Fiat 500,</i>

<i>and $100,000.</i>

22:05.491 --> 22:09.060
[cheers and applause]

22:09.095 --> 22:10.695
All right,
so why don't we check in

22:10.730 --> 22:12.263
with our directors over here.

22:12.298 --> 22:14.799
How did everything go for
you guys these last few days?

22:14.834 --> 22:16.434
- It was intense.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.369
Shooting was just--
it's like a blur.

22:18.404 --> 22:20.137
- I'm still in the blur
right now.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.173
But what we accomplished
together,

22:22.208 --> 22:23.307
it was pretty incredible.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.842
- Absolutely.
It was super cool.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.178
That was a first
for me, yeah.

22:27.213 --> 22:30.114
[applause]

22:30.149 --> 22:32.016
- All right, well,
let's say hello to our judges--

22:32.051 --> 22:34.485
owner of Alchemy Studio,
Glenn Hetrick...

22:34.520 --> 22:38.322
- Good evening.

22:38.358 --> 22:41.625
- Oscar- and Emmy-award-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

22:41.661 --> 22:44.862
- Good evening, everybody.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.064
- Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.933
- Hello, everyone.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.135
[applause]

22:51.170 --> 22:53.003
- And, of course,
we are joined again

22:53.039 --> 22:55.639
by the man
behind huge horror hits,

22:55.675 --> 22:57.942
<i>like "Paranormal Activity,"</i>
<i>"The Purge,"</i>

22:57.977 --> 22:59.810
<i>"Insidious,"</i>
<i>and "Sinister"--</i>

22:59.846 --> 23:01.946
Mr. Jason Blum.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.647
- Thank you.
Thank you.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.151
- How you doing?

23:07.186 --> 23:08.619
- Very well.
- Excellent.

23:08.654 --> 23:11.389
Well, before we talk
to each of our finalists,

23:11.424 --> 23:12.590
I should let everyone know,

23:12.625 --> 23:16.427
we showed Jason footage
from each of your films

23:16.462 --> 23:17.762
to get him up to speed.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.830
So, Jason, what did you think
about what you saw?

23:19.866 --> 23:23.434
- Super, super creative
and just really cool.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.736
I was completely blown away,
actually.

23:25.772 --> 23:29.039
- All right, well, it is time
to get down to business.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.175
So, for this finale,

23:31.210 --> 23:33.244
we asked you to create
two characters--

23:33.279 --> 23:36.280
a demon
and its possessed victim--

23:36.315 --> 23:38.849
to star in your very own
horror films.

23:38.885 --> 23:42.520
And the film scripts
were adapted by our directors

23:42.555 --> 23:46.390
from the Christopher Denham
story, "Hellhole"

23:46.426 --> 23:49.894
in Jason's book, "The Blumhouse
Book of Nightmares."

23:49.929 --> 23:51.295
So, with that in mind,

23:51.330 --> 23:53.230
the judges would like to speak
with each of you

23:53.266 --> 23:55.199
before they choose a winner.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.902
Melissa, you are up first.

23:57.937 --> 24:01.572
[applause]

24:01.607 --> 24:03.340
- Team Badass!

24:03.376 --> 24:04.875
[laughter]

24:04.911 --> 24:06.243
- Hi, Melissa.
- Hi, Glenn.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.645
- Start off by explaining

24:07.680 --> 24:10.080
the concept behind your makeups
and your process.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.882
- Our concept is a demon

24:11.918 --> 24:14.652
who is trying
to come into our world

24:14.687 --> 24:16.454
through this doll, Mr. Sticks.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.289
So we wanted
to incorporate elements

24:18.324 --> 24:20.057
from the demon in Sam's makeup

24:20.092 --> 24:22.760
and draw from our environment
and have references

24:22.795 --> 24:24.929
to the sinister
om   inous oil rigs.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.697
I'm very happy
with how it turned out.

24:26.732 --> 24:29.667
- As are we.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.836
We loved how cohesive
the whole thing was.

24:31.871 --> 24:35.206
The use of the actual organic
elements in the prosthetics

24:35.241 --> 24:40.077
helped a lot to tie it
to the nature of the story.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.879
- What I really liked
about the demon

24:41.914 --> 24:44.982
<i>is that it was a mix</i>
<i>between a two-eyed creature</i>

24:45.017 --> 24:46.417
<i>and a single-eyed creature.</i>

24:46.452 --> 24:50.688
The shape of the actual face
felt really, really original.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.089
- Oh, thank you.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.091
- And I have to say,
that's where she made it better,

24:54.126 --> 24:55.926
'cause I actually asked
for a circle at first,

24:55.962 --> 24:57.061
and she said--
- Really?

24:57.096 --> 24:58.596
Ooh, I love--
I love getting into it.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.831
- She said to me, "But that's,
like, been done so many times."

25:00.867 --> 25:01.832
- Yeah.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.367
- It was like,
"All right, cool."

25:03.402 --> 25:05.803
[l  aughter]

25:05.838 --> 25:08.405
- I have tgio ve you kudos.
I really loved the paint job.

25:08.441 --> 25:11.141
<i>And there was a really great</i>
<i>over-the-shoulder shot of him</i>

25:11.177 --> 25:13.811
<i>with that mottling that--</i>
<i>all the white and the grey.</i>

25:13.846 --> 25:15.913
It was very effective.
It looked really terrific.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.582
Well done.
- Thank you.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.884
- All right, Melissa.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.085
It's time to check out
your film, "Hellhole,"

25:21.120 --> 25:24.054
directed by John Wynn.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.256
<i>- They're about</i>
<i>to roll my film,</i>

was very of the Earth,

29:38.836 --> 29:40.436
How did you work with him?

29:40.471 --> 29:42.171
- We sort of had this
bouncing back and forth,

29:42.206 --> 29:44.607
and he took the textures
and the ideas that I wanted,

29:44.642 --> 29:48.310

that was really terrifying.

29:48.346 --> 29:50.713
- It was very successful.

29:50.748 --> 29:53.048
- You covered a lot of ground.

- Hi.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.325
- Tell us
about your characters.

34:22.361 --> 34:25.228
- When this family moved here
and was violating the Earth

34:25.264 --> 34:27.030
with the oil pumps
and everything,

34:27.066 --> 34:29.299
it released
this malevolent spirit.

34:29.334 --> 34:34.071
And for the demon, Bryce wanted
a subterranean creature.

34:34.106 --> 34:35.472
And then for the possession,

34:35.507 --> 34:39.376
he wanted a subtle human makeup
with correlations to the demon,

34:39.411 --> 34:41.878
<i>like it was affecting</i>
<i>her physically.</i>

34:41.914 --> 34:45.282
- The one word for me
that defines what you achieved

34:45.317 --> 34:49.152
is "efficacy."

34:49.188 --> 34:53.490
You created a character
that had classic demon features,

34:53.525 --> 34:56.927
<i>and it's allowing</i>
<i>the audience to quickly get</i>

34:56.962 --> 34:58.762
<i>exactly what you're trying</i>
<i>to communicate.</i>

34:58.797 --> 35:03.166
And that success trickled down
to your possession character.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.668
- I really like
both the characters.

35:04.703 --> 35:07.537
I loved particularly
the little dust

35:07.573 --> 35:09.406
that flickered off the demon.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.875
<i>It almost looked like</i>
<i>an evil magic dust,</i>

35:11.910 --> 35:13.910
which I thought was great.

35:13.946 --> 35:17.147

35:21.920 --> 35:23.487

35:23.522 --> 35:25.055

35:25.090 --> 35:27.157
<i>to the point where you couldn't</i>
<i>see the human anymore.</i>

35:27.192 --> 35:29.126
What a brilliant way

35:29.161 --> 35:31.728
to conceptualize
showing the possession.

35:31.763 --> 35:32.963
- This man.

35:32.998 --> 35:34.531

Hey, talk to me.
Hey.

Hey.
Hey.

38:34.212 --> 38:37.514
What happened, Martha?

You shouldn't have come here.

- [growling]

38:48.827 --> 38:49.926

[machinery squeaking]

39:02.774 --> 39:05.775
[applause]

39:09.448 --> 39:10.714
- Rob, thank you vermuy ch.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.115
- Thank you.
- You can step back.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.983
- [whistles]
- Nice.

39:14.019 --> 39:17.454
[applause]

39:17.489 --> 39:18.688
- All right, guys,

39:18.724 --> 39:21.658
it's time for the judges
to deliberate in private

39:21.693 --> 39:24.027
and choose
this season's champion.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.695
anThk you.

39:27.499 --> 39:30.567
All right, judges, so let's talk
about tonight's finalists.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.135
<i>Why don't we start</i>
<i>with Melissa?</i>

39:32.170 --> 39:35.138
<i>- I thought she did a great job</i>
<i>doing what the director wanted.</i>

39:35.173 --> 39:37.607
<i>That really is at the core</i>
<i>of the challenge tonight.</i>

39:37.642 --> 39:40.110
- Where Melissa did deviate

39:40.145 --> 39:44.414
was when he said he wanted
a round, orbital hole,

39:44.449 --> 39:45.949
<i>and that's where she created</i>

39:45.984 --> 39:47.617
<i>something</i>
<i>much more interesting.</i>

39:47.652 --> 39:50.286
- Coming up with an original way
to solve that problem

39:50.322 --> 39:53.390
not only made it better,
but it created, for me,

39:53.425 --> 39:54.891
the best piece of the makeup.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.159
- I was a little confused

39:56.194 --> 39:58.728
about the possessed character
initially.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.997
<i>- It really wasn't evident</i>
<i>when you see him at first.</i>

40:01.032 --> 40:02.799
<i>He just looked like a guy</i>
<i>who had boils</i>

40:02.834 --> 40:04.000
<i>and sores all over him,</i>

40:04.035 --> 40:05.435
<i>but when they did</i>
<i>the reverse shot,</i>

40:05.470 --> 40:07.771
<i>you could see all the twigs</i>
<i>coming out of his head,</i>

40:07.806 --> 40:09.906
so that was a cool effect,
I think.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.808
- All right,
let's move on to Walter.

40:11.843 --> 40:14.210
<i>- Walter's demon</i>
<i>was very cool.</i>

40:14.246 --> 40:15.979
<i>I loved the misshapen gourd</i>

40:16.014 --> 40:18.181
and he really go
tthe director's vision.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.517
- They came up
with so many brilliant ways

40:20.552 --> 40:24.020
to cover a lot of ground,
and it still was quality.

40:24.055 --> 40:27.023
<i>The two characters felt like</i>
<i>they were from the same world.</i>

40:27.058 --> 40:28.291
<i>Also, the fact that it comes</i>

40:28.326 --> 40:29.659
<i>from this collection</i>
<i>of stories--</i>

40:29.694 --> 40:31.094
How do you think it resonates

40:31.129 --> 40:33.997
as far as
its actual source material?

40:34.032 --> 40:36.933
- It's funny, none of what I saw
was like what I imagined,

40:36.968 --> 40:39.469
but I would say, I feel like it
was all a lot better.

40:39.504 --> 40:40.870
It's pretty awesome.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.440
- All right,
let's move on to Rob.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.108
<i>- Absolutely stunning.</i>

40:45.143 --> 40:47.243
<i>He managed his time so well</i>

40:47.279 --> 40:49.279
<i>and focused on what needed</i>
<i>to be focused on</i>

40:49.314 --> 40:52.382
in regard to the classic
features of a demon,

40:52.417 --> 40:55.251
but turning up the volume
on his style.

40:55.287 --> 40:56.953
It was absolutely beautiful.

40:56.988 --> 40:59.422
- I particularly loved
the horn arrangement.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.258
<i>And that twisted motion,</i>
<i>it was so cool.</i>

41:02.294 --> 41:04.360
It was like
he had a crown of horns.

41:04.396 --> 41:07.697
- One of the boldest choices was
the way that the color came out.

41:07.732 --> 41:11.034
<i>If that thing would have been</i>
<i>any busier, color-wise,</i>

41:11.069 --> 41:12.435
it would have just been mud.

41:12.471 --> 41:14.471
Absolutely.
- That was really awesome.

41:14.506 --> 41:15.672
- Yeah, it was done so well.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.808
- All right, then, judges,
have you chosen a winner?

41:18.844 --> 41:20.210
- I think we have.
- Yeah.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.312
- Excellent,
'cause now comes the fun part.

41:22.347 --> 41:24.280
Let's bring them back out.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.349
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

41:26.384 --> 41:29.953
It's time to crown
this season's champion.

41:29.988 --> 41:33.523
So, Glenn,
who is the winner of "Face Off"?

41:33.558 --> 41:36.226
- The winner of "Face Of" is...

41:42.942 --> 41:44.776
- The winner of "Face Of" is...

I just won "Face Off."

42:03.663 --> 42:05.296
- You are the winner
of "Face Off"!

42:05.331 --> 42:06.964
Congratulations!
- Holy crap!

42:07.000 --> 42:10.134
I cannot believe that I won.

42:10.170 --> 42:12.737
<i>This has been the most</i>
<i>life-changing experience</i>

42:12.772 --> 42:13.805
<i>I've every had.</i>

42:13.840 --> 42:14.939
It's crazy.

42:14.974 --> 42:16.240
- Good job, Rob.

42:16.276 --> 42:19.610
I'm excited for Rob.
He is incredibly talented.

42:19.646 --> 42:21.646
<i>I didn't win,</i>
<i>but it was a dream of mine</i>

42:21.681 --> 42:23.114
<i>to be on "Face Off,"</i>

42:23.149 --> 42:25.683
<i>and I'm so proud of myself</i>
<i>for making it this far.</i>

42:25.718 --> 42:27.718
It was an awesome experience.

42:27.754 --> 42:29.554
<i>- This competition has meant</i>
<i>everything to me.</i>

42:29.589 --> 42:31.155
I mean,
I've grown tremendously.

42:31.191 --> 42:33.191
I've learned so, so much.

42:33.226 --> 42:34.625
<i>This was a unique experience,</i>

42:34.661 --> 42:36.360
and I'm forever grateful
for that.

42:36.396 --> 42:39.964
- Here are the keys
to your brand-new car.

42:39.999 --> 42:42.700
Congratulations.
- That works!

42:42.735 --> 42:44.102
The fact that my parents
are here

42:44.137 --> 42:47.105
and I get to share
this huge moment with them

42:47.140 --> 42:49.140
is one of the coolest things
about all of this.

42:49.175 --> 42:51.275
<i>If someone gives you</i>
<i>an opportunity,</i>

42:51.311 --> 42:52.777
take it and run with it,

42:52.812 --> 42:55.246
because you could do
something great.

42:55.281 --> 42:58.182
