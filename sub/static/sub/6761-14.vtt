02:15.413 --> 02:18.332
- Hey, Bren. What you doing?
- Homework.

02:18.749 --> 02:21.711
Do you have any idea
what's going on downstairs?

02:21.794 --> 02:25.673
Yeah. Mom and Dad are throwing
a party for Chick Schneider.

02:26.007 --> 02:27.633
Who's Chick Schneider?

02:27.717 --> 02:30.928
CS Schneider? CS Pacific?

02:31.595 --> 02:34.098
He's like the king kahuna
of beach fashion.

02:34.181 --> 02:36.892
He makes all those great wipe-out pants
that Dylan always wears.

02:36.976 --> 02:38.144
Oh, right.

02:38.227 --> 02:39.603
So, he's, like, Dad's new client,

02:39.687 --> 02:42.314
and he wants to give us
loads of freebies at the party.

02:42.398 --> 02:45.234
That's great, but what does that have
to do with Anna?

02:45.317 --> 02:47.736
Well, I think Mom's gonna let Anna
cater the party.

02:47.820 --> 02:51.198
I don't think so. I think she's being fired.

02:53.075 --> 02:54.785
Brandon, Brenda,

02:55.578 --> 02:58.330
could you come down here
for a minute?

03:01.041 --> 03:04.586
I want you to meet Anna's cousin,
Richard Rodriguez.

03:04.670 --> 03:08.966
Brandon, Brenda,
finally I get a chance to meet you.

03:09.174 --> 03:11.301
Anna's been telling us
how terrific you both are.

03:11.385 --> 03:13.595
Well, we think she's pretty terrific, too.

03:13.679 --> 03:16.515
- Isn't that right, Mom?
- Oh, absolutely.

03:16.890 --> 03:20.602
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

03:23.147 --> 03:26.775
- I'm not sure I know where to begin.
- Oh, here, let me try, Mrs Walsh.

03:26.859 --> 03:28.944
Your parents are being very kind.

03:29.027 --> 03:32.322
Anna has a niece that attends
one of the local high schools here

03:32.406 --> 03:35.575
that's been having some...
Well, some trouble.

03:35.951 --> 03:39.287
Yes, Carla's very smart.
She's a straight-A student,

03:39.371 --> 03:42.374
but with the gangs and drugs,
it's terrible.

03:42.457 --> 03:44.459
And it's depriving her of the opportunity

03:44.543 --> 03:47.546
to get the kind of education
that she deserves.

03:47.629 --> 03:50.382
So, your mother and I want to let Carla
use our address

03:50.465 --> 03:52.050
to enroll in West Beverly.

03:52.134 --> 03:53.677
You'd do that?

03:53.885 --> 03:55.679
Not normally, no,

03:55.762 --> 03:59.099
but under the circumstances,
I think it can be justified.

03:59.307 --> 04:00.851
Fine with me.

04:01.726 --> 04:04.479
If you don't have a problem with it,
I don't have a problem with it.

04:04.563 --> 04:07.148
- Then it's all settled.
- Thank you.

04:07.399 --> 04:09.651
You know,
we can show her around, if you want.

04:09.734 --> 04:13.780
Well, you can try, but Carla doesn't like
to attract a lot of attention to herself.

04:13.863 --> 04:15.407
I understand.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.165
<i>Good morning, MC Hammer's office.</i>

04:24.290 --> 04:27.836
Hi, how are you?
Is he in for David Silver?

04:27.919 --> 04:29.003
<i>For who?</i>

04:29.087 --> 04:31.214
David Silver,
broadcasting live and direct

04:31.297 --> 04:34.008
from the tree-lined campus
of West Beverly High.

04:34.092 --> 04:37.178
<i>- Beverly High?
- West Beverly High.</i>

04:37.262 --> 04:39.138
<i>- Does Mr Hammer know who you are?
- Not yet,</i>

04:39.222 --> 04:41.391
but he will
once you put the call through.

04:43.101 --> 04:44.352
Hello?

04:44.686 --> 04:45.770
<i>Hello?</i>

04:45.853 --> 04:48.189
I'm sorry, but David Silver is out there.

04:48.273 --> 04:51.484
It's too bad. He used to be
such a sweet little freshman geek.

04:51.567 --> 04:53.695
Steve's favorite mascot.

04:59.701 --> 05:01.452
So, I can get you
a bunch of wipe-out pants

05:01.536 --> 05:02.745
in all different colors.

05:02.829 --> 05:06.207
But you have to be looking at me
when I talk to you. Dylan!

05:10.545 --> 05:13.965
Are you telling me
the fax machine went down again?

05:14.131 --> 05:15.842
The fax machine went down again.

05:15.925 --> 05:18.469
This school is falling apart
right before my very eyes.

05:18.553 --> 05:19.929
Can I help you?

05:20.012 --> 05:21.639
This isn't the new building, is it?

05:21.722 --> 05:23.891
No, you have to go back out
through the quad

05:23.975 --> 05:25.434
and past the science labs.

05:25.518 --> 05:27.311
Which way is that?

05:27.395 --> 05:30.272
It's through the double doors.
I'm going that way. I'll show you.

05:30.356 --> 05:33.025
Great, and stick me with your typos?

05:33.567 --> 05:34.694
What typos?

05:34.777 --> 05:36.612
You totally forgot the "a" in recreational,

05:36.696 --> 05:39.365
and you failed
to capitalize "Sacramento."

05:39.448 --> 05:42.201
Well, that's because Sacramento
doesn't deserve a capital.

05:42.284 --> 05:45.246
Hey, cheap shot.
I was born in Sacramento.

05:48.374 --> 05:51.168
We'll try not to hold that against you.

05:53.712 --> 05:56.799
Hi, I'm Andrea Zuckerman.
I'm the editor of the school paper.

05:56.882 --> 06:01.053
- Hi, I'm Carla Montez. I'm...
- Carla! I'm Brandon Walsh.

06:01.679 --> 06:04.056
You know, Jim and Cindy Walsh.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.393
Hello, Brandon.

06:08.310 --> 06:10.187
So, Anna's your aunt?

06:10.521 --> 06:13.774
- More like a friend of the family.
- Well, she's the best.

06:13.857 --> 06:17.569
She's always so cheerful.
My mom really loves her. We all do.

06:17.653 --> 06:19.405
That's why there was never
any question of us

06:19.488 --> 06:22.991
- doing whatever we can to help you out.
- That's very kind.

06:23.075 --> 06:24.993
Hey, listen,
Brenda and I know what it's like

06:25.077 --> 06:28.789
starting at this school from scratch,
and we can introduce you to people

06:28.872 --> 06:31.625
or answer any questions you have,
or whatever.

06:31.708 --> 06:32.960
Thanks.

06:33.377 --> 06:37.923
- So, what are you taking?
- French, tech and American literature.

06:38.340 --> 06:40.467
You're in practically every one
of my classes.

06:40.550 --> 06:42.427
Is that good or bad?

06:43.095 --> 06:46.473
I think that's good.
I think that's very good.

06:49.184 --> 06:53.688
Listen, just one word of caution,
don't be too put off if the kids here

06:53.772 --> 06:56.817
are a little more competitive
than you're used to.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.944
I'll keep that in mind.

07:10.413 --> 07:13.041
<i>Putting aside the music
of My Fair Lady for a second,</i>

07:13.124 --> 07:14.751
<i>when I read Pygmalion,</i>

07:14.834 --> 07:17.379
I couldn't help but think
that Shaw was a total misogynist.

07:17.462 --> 07:20.215
With fiber optics, you can't depend
on an internal light source

07:20.298 --> 07:23.635
unless you can differentiate
between the filters.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.931
Anna said you were smart, but
she didn't mention you were a genius.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.892
Oh, come on. I just like to participate
in class discussions.

07:30.975 --> 07:32.477
You mean dominate them.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.522
Hey, all I want to do is get into
a good college like everybody else.

07:35.605 --> 07:39.442
Well, something tells me you won't have
any problem getting a scholarship.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.278
So, what are you saying?
A Hispanic can't get into a top college

07:42.362 --> 07:44.656
without some kind of
special assistance?

07:44.739 --> 07:47.200
- I didn't say that.
- No, not in so many words,

07:47.283 --> 07:49.661
but when you bring up
a minority scholarship out of the blue,

07:49.744 --> 07:51.079
it's pretty obvious
what kind of stereotypes

07:51.162 --> 07:52.580
- you're carrying around.
- Wait a second.

07:52.664 --> 07:55.291
Who said anything
about a minority scholarship?

07:55.375 --> 07:58.670
I was talking about financial aid,
something practically everyone can use,

07:58.753 --> 08:00.171
including me.

08:00.254 --> 08:04.133
So, excuse me if I didn't realize
you were independently wealthy.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.135
- Brandon...
- You know, I've gone out of my way

08:06.219 --> 08:10.556
to make this place a little less strange,
and you bite my head off.

08:12.308 --> 08:14.602
If you want to be alone,
why don't you just say so?

08:14.685 --> 08:15.812
It's not that.

08:15.895 --> 08:18.314
Well, then, what's going on here, Carla?

08:18.564 --> 08:21.734
It's just very complicated.

08:22.443 --> 08:24.946
Well, I'd love to hear all about it
someday,

08:25.029 --> 08:28.407
but the fact is
I gotta be at work in 20 minutes.

08:28.491 --> 08:31.577
- You work?
- Yeah, I work,

08:32.370 --> 08:35.246
or doesn't that fit
whatever Beverly Hills stereotype

08:35.331 --> 08:37.249
you're carrying around these days?

08:37.332 --> 08:39.376
- Touche.
- Ole.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.171
<i>So, where do you work, muchacho?</i>

08:43.339 --> 08:46.884
This is Kelly. That's Donna.
The guy back there is Steve,

08:46.967 --> 08:50.429
- and this is my sister Brenda.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

08:50.513 --> 08:54.016
Oh, and this handsome devil is Nat.
Mr Beverly Hills chichi himself.

08:54.099 --> 08:55.184
The same.

08:55.267 --> 08:57.478
He might be ugly,
but he serves great pie.

08:57.561 --> 09:00.731
It's from an old family recipe,
right out of the box.

09:02.566 --> 09:05.736
- So, she's related to your maid?
- I'll tell you later.

09:05.819 --> 09:08.822
Brenda, are you sure we can have
anything in this catalogue that we want?

09:08.906 --> 09:11.909
Yeah, just tell me the color, the size,
and it's yours.

09:11.992 --> 09:14.912
Wow. God, these baggies
are so trendoid.

09:16.580 --> 09:19.249
Hey, Brenda,
you think Carla can place an order, too?

09:19.333 --> 09:21.960
Sure, if you like Chick Schneider's stuff.

09:22.044 --> 09:25.005
I love Chick Schneider.
Who's Chick Schneider?

09:26.465 --> 09:29.676
Oh, cute stuff. I'll take one of each.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.055
- Oh! Our kind of girl.
- I like this.

09:36.808 --> 09:40.354
She's into you, Brandon.
Listen to me, I can feel it.

09:40.979 --> 09:43.065
- Yeah.
- Yeah, just slightly bright.

09:47.235 --> 09:49.738
Here you go.
Compliments of the house.

09:49.821 --> 09:51.448
- Thanks.
- Enjoy it.

09:51.531 --> 09:52.949
I plan to.

10:12.302 --> 10:15.096
So, is this part of town
considered East LA?

10:15.180 --> 10:17.390
Well, it's not Rodeo Drive.

10:36.117 --> 10:39.245
- Where are they coming from?
- Work.

10:39.746 --> 10:41.873
- Where?
- Anywhere.

10:43.208 --> 10:46.044
The trucks come in the morning.
That's when it's the worst,

10:46.127 --> 10:49.005
seeing 10 of them
chasing the trucks down the street,

10:49.088 --> 10:51.090
all for hard labor and very cheap pay.

10:51.174 --> 10:54.052
But who would just pick people up
off the street?

10:54.636 --> 10:59.599
How do you think all those pools and
tennis courts in Beverly Hills get built?

11:12.028 --> 11:16.449
- This is where Anna lives?
- What did you expect? A deluxe condo?

11:17.325 --> 11:22.205
Are you this defensive with everyone,
or do I just bring out the best in you?

11:22.663 --> 11:25.333
You and your friends have so much
that you take for granted.

11:25.416 --> 11:26.667
You can't appreciate it.

11:26.751 --> 11:28.711
Can't appreciate what?

11:28.794 --> 11:30.796
The language lab. The media centre.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.465
The safe, clean classrooms
that you have.

11:32.548 --> 11:35.885
Wait a second.
Those are your classrooms now, too,

11:36.052 --> 11:39.722
and with your brains, you'll be able
to do whatever you want with your life.

11:39.805 --> 11:43.934
Yeah, I'd like to believe that, too,
but then I go into the Peach Pit

11:44.018 --> 11:46.854
and I see those guys in the kitchen
looking at me like I'm a traitor

11:46.937 --> 11:48.731
for being
on the wrong side of the counter.

11:48.814 --> 11:50.858
Who are you talking about?
Manuel and Pepe?

11:50.941 --> 11:52.151
I don't know their names.

11:52.234 --> 11:54.278
The busboys,
the two guys in the little hats.

11:54.361 --> 11:55.529
Yes!

11:55.946 --> 11:58.115
'Cause they're not like that.

11:58.199 --> 12:00.534
If they were looking at you
it's because you're a pretty girl,

12:00.618 --> 12:02.453
not because you're Hispanic.

12:02.536 --> 12:06.040
And I gotta say, and I hope
you don't take this the wrong way,

12:06.123 --> 12:10.336
but I think a lot of this is in your head,
because I don't see it.

12:12.338 --> 12:15.924
You're very perceptive, Brandon,
and very sweet,

12:16.008 --> 12:18.927
but my life is so complicated right now.

12:21.138 --> 12:23.474
So, what can we do to simplify it?

12:23.557 --> 12:27.811
I can't decide if you're for real
or just a real smooth operator.

12:27.978 --> 12:30.606
I guess you'll just have to find that out,
won't you?

12:30.689 --> 12:32.024
Thanks for the ride.

12:32.107 --> 12:35.235
- I'll see you in school tomorrow.
- Definitely.

12:49.291 --> 12:50.876
Sorry I'm late.

12:52.169 --> 12:55.756
You better be careful, girl.
That's all I have to say.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.612
- What's wrong?
- You've got that look this morning.

13:18.695 --> 13:19.821
What look?

13:19.905 --> 13:23.074
That "Come on, baby, light my fire"
kind of a look.

13:23.158 --> 13:24.367
What?

13:25.243 --> 13:29.205
That "Hey, Carla, how you doing
this morning?" kind of a look.

13:29.331 --> 13:30.582
Get out of here.

13:30.665 --> 13:33.668
People are starting to talk
about you guys.

13:34.544 --> 13:35.795
What are they saying?

13:35.879 --> 13:37.714
Oh, it's just that
ever since we moved to LA,

13:37.797 --> 13:40.258
every girl you meet
suddenly becomes your next true love.

13:40.341 --> 13:43.053
- That's not true. What about Andrea?
- That doesn't count.

13:43.136 --> 13:45.430
She's your editor.
You have a professional relationship.

13:45.513 --> 13:47.974
And I have
a platonic relationship with Carla.

13:48.057 --> 13:49.559
For how long?

13:50.143 --> 13:53.354
You mean if it stops being platonic,
you might have a problem with it?

13:53.438 --> 13:55.732
What, you think I'm hung-up
because she's Hispanic?

13:55.815 --> 13:58.443
A lot of people get really weird
when it comes to the race thing.

13:58.526 --> 14:02.155
Well, not me, and I'm really offended
that you'd even bring that up.

14:02.238 --> 14:04.032
As far as I'm concerned,
people are people,

14:04.115 --> 14:07.076
no matter who they are
or where they come from,

14:07.160 --> 14:09.078
except maybe St Paul.

14:10.538 --> 14:12.957
Okay, Anna, now explain this to me.

14:13.207 --> 14:17.086
We're gonna start off
with the corn tamales, the rellenos,

14:17.170 --> 14:19.380
and the guacamole with tapas?

14:19.464 --> 14:21.299
Tapas, finger food.

14:21.382 --> 14:24.135
- Hello.
- Hey, beautiful. Hey, big guy.

14:24.218 --> 14:27.638
- So, you have the CS Pacific catalogue?
- Yes, I do.

14:28.431 --> 14:31.809
Here's the catalogue and our wish list.

14:32.310 --> 14:34.770
I can't get over how generous
Chick is being with the kids.

14:34.854 --> 14:37.773
With the kind of dough he's raking in,
believe me, he can afford it.

14:37.857 --> 14:40.776
Hey, Anna, listen, I was thinking,
the days that you work here,

14:40.860 --> 14:42.570
could Carla come in with you
in the morning?

14:42.653 --> 14:44.572
That way,
Brenda and I could give her a ride,

14:44.655 --> 14:48.242
and she wouldn't have to get up so early
to catch the bus.

14:48.326 --> 14:49.744
We'll see.

14:50.786 --> 14:53.539
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

14:57.752 --> 15:00.588
<i>- MC Hammer's office.
- Hi, MC Hammer, please?</i>

15:00.921 --> 15:02.423
<i>Who is this?</i>

15:03.632 --> 15:06.343
Well, if I tell you,
do you promise not to hang up?

15:15.227 --> 15:16.729
Yo, Sam!

15:19.815 --> 15:20.983
Sam.

15:21.358 --> 15:22.985
- Me?
- Come here.

15:24.778 --> 15:26.405
- I'm Scott.
- Whatever.

15:26.488 --> 15:28.991
What's going on
with him and MC Hammer?

15:29.074 --> 15:31.618
David wants him to play at the prom.

15:31.702 --> 15:34.747
MC Hammer's not going to play
at any school dance.

15:34.830 --> 15:38.000
You know that, and I know that,
and MC Hammer knows that,

15:38.083 --> 15:41.462
but, unfortunately,
somebody forgot to tell David.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.216
Oh, hey,
I'm going to need two more graphs

15:46.300 --> 15:47.634
on the Coach Cass profile.

15:47.718 --> 15:48.927
Fine.

15:50.262 --> 15:53.181
- I need to ask you something, okay?
- Shoot.

15:54.558 --> 15:57.227
What's your relationship with Carla?

16:02.858 --> 16:04.818
Have you been talking to Brenda?

16:04.901 --> 16:08.697
No, I just happened to be
in the Registrar's Office,

16:08.780 --> 16:11.366
and Carla's file
just happened to be on the counter

16:11.450 --> 16:13.577
with her address showing.

16:15.328 --> 16:17.122
Oh, Andrea.

16:18.498 --> 16:21.751
I'm sorry. You know how I am.

16:23.879 --> 16:27.340
- You just forget what you saw, okay?
- Already done.

16:28.425 --> 16:29.634
Good.

16:36.391 --> 16:40.312
I just need to know.
Is she living at your house?

16:41.604 --> 16:44.983
- What do you think?
- I think you better watch out.

16:45.233 --> 16:48.653
- You're one to talk.
- That's precisely my point.

16:48.737 --> 16:53.825
If anybody is found living out of district,
it can cause a whole chain reaction.

16:54.409 --> 16:55.952
I'll tell everyone to be careful.

16:56.035 --> 16:58.621
Okay, great.
I mean, that's all I'm asking.

16:59.164 --> 17:00.874
That's all you're asking?

17:01.040 --> 17:03.626
Oh, well,

17:03.710 --> 17:06.003
since we're on the subject...

17:06.880 --> 17:11.675
Okay, okay. For the record,
yes, I'm very attracted to Carla,

17:11.759 --> 17:14.012
and, yes,
I'd like to get to know her better.

17:14.095 --> 17:17.473
I'm very happy for you,
but that wasn't my question.

17:17.557 --> 17:19.642
What else do you want to know?

17:19.726 --> 17:22.478
Well, I hear that she's very smart,

17:22.561 --> 17:26.022
and I wanted to know
if you knew what her GPA was?

17:30.403 --> 17:34.699
Hi! Remember me? Brandon Walsh.
I drove you home a couple of days ago.

17:34.782 --> 17:36.284
Yeah, I thought
I knew you from somewhere.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.744
Yeah, well, it must be from somewhere
other than school.

17:38.828 --> 17:40.997
The way you dash out of class
when the bell rings,

17:41.080 --> 17:43.040
- I'm starting to get a complex.
- I'm sorry.

17:43.124 --> 17:45.835
It's just that when I'm at school,
I just tend to shut everybody out.

17:45.918 --> 17:48.421
Well, then, I'll just have to see you
outside of school.

17:48.504 --> 17:51.924
- Brandon, you're a really nice guy, but...
- Wait. No "buts."

17:52.758 --> 17:55.761
Tonight. 7:30. Your place.
I'll pick you up.

17:56.303 --> 18:00.224
- Brandon, I can't.
- Okay, all right, all right.

18:00.558 --> 18:03.602
Tomorrow. 7:30. Your place.
I'll pick you up.

18:03.686 --> 18:06.272
I might be working tomorrow night.

18:07.606 --> 18:11.652
- How about Sunday?
- I go to church on Sunday.

18:12.611 --> 18:13.946
All day?

18:14.530 --> 18:16.866
I have to go. Say hi to Brenda for me.

18:21.662 --> 18:23.956
So, what's new, Brandon?

18:39.763 --> 18:43.434
Excuse me, ma'am,
did someone order an express shuttle?

18:47.396 --> 18:49.648
You don't know when to quit, do you?

18:49.731 --> 18:52.109
Hey, I just go
where my dispatcher tells me.

18:52.192 --> 18:55.737
Besides, you can't rely on the buses
in this city. They're never running.

18:55.821 --> 18:57.906
And with me
you're guaranteed first-class,

18:57.990 --> 19:00.409
courteous, door-to-door service.

19:01.243 --> 19:03.078
So, what do you say?

19:10.669 --> 19:13.088
So, do you miss your old school?

19:14.631 --> 19:17.384
I miss my old school. In Minneapolis.

19:18.510 --> 19:20.887
I had a lot of good friends back there.

19:20.971 --> 19:24.266
I have friends here, too,
but it's not the same.

19:28.103 --> 19:30.230
Anna mentioned something.

19:30.397 --> 19:32.357
There was some kind of trouble
at your old school,

19:32.440 --> 19:34.234
something to do with drugs.

19:34.317 --> 19:36.945
Brandon, this isn't what
I want to be talking about.

19:37.028 --> 19:40.323
I'm sorry.
What do you want to be talking about?

19:40.907 --> 19:43.368
You're not making this very easy,
are you?

19:43.451 --> 19:45.161
Making what easy?

19:47.080 --> 19:48.873
You don't know anything about me.

19:48.957 --> 19:53.378
That's right, and you're not being
any help in that area, Ms. Montez.

19:53.461 --> 19:55.171
It's an age-old story.

19:55.255 --> 19:56.673
Boy meets girl. Boy likes girl.

19:56.756 --> 19:59.926
Boy gets girl
if girl gives boy half a chance.

20:00.510 --> 20:01.970
One chance.

20:03.638 --> 20:05.557
Do you like to dance?

20:06.724 --> 20:08.476
Is this my chance?

20:36.879 --> 20:40.091
- What is this place?
- The community rec centre.

21:24.510 --> 21:25.844
Come on.

21:28.389 --> 21:32.226
- You ready to walk the line?
- No, I'm the world's worst dancer.

21:32.309 --> 21:35.771
Oh, come on, you're not gonna
make me do it by myself?

22:19.940 --> 22:21.691
Oh, this is great.

22:22.526 --> 22:26.029
You really get to see
the whole skyline from up here.

22:26.405 --> 22:28.615
I don't get downtown too much.

22:28.698 --> 22:30.617
Oh, you have to see Olvera Street.

22:30.700 --> 22:34.454
<i>El Pueblo de la Reina de Los Angeles,
founded in 1781.</i>

22:36.289 --> 22:40.752
- You'll have to show me that sometime.
- I think that can be arranged.

22:42.045 --> 22:43.797
Is that a promise?

22:59.437 --> 23:02.899
That's what I wanted since
the first time I saw you.

23:03.066 --> 23:05.860
I can't believe it's only been a week.

23:18.748 --> 23:20.917
Cindy, come on.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.170
You used to pull off dinner parties
back home without batting an eyelash.

23:24.253 --> 23:27.882
That was back home,
not the first one in Beverly Hills.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.136
The guys from the rental company
are here.

23:32.220 --> 23:34.806
They need to know
where they should set up the chairs.

23:34.889 --> 23:37.016
Why don't we stack them
in the living room for now?

23:37.100 --> 23:40.103
- And get Brandon to help.
- Brandon's not here.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.604
Where did he run off to so early?

23:41.687 --> 23:43.523
I think he had to work
at the Peach Pit all day.

23:43.606 --> 23:45.650
He was out awfully late last night,
wasn't he?

23:45.733 --> 23:48.361
I don't know, Mom. I fell out early.

23:50.321 --> 23:53.032
You know who he went out with
last night, don't you?

23:53.115 --> 23:54.450
I have an inkling.

23:54.534 --> 23:57.453
Maybe we should tell the kids
the truth about Carla.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.455
I don't think we can.

24:24.855 --> 24:27.775
- Brandon.
- Did someone order room service?

24:28.359 --> 24:32.446
We got pan dulce, apple quesadilla,

24:32.947 --> 24:35.866
<i>cafe en casa, the whole enchilada.</i>

24:36.575 --> 24:39.828
The guy at the pastry shop
promised me this was good stuff.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.872
Yeah, but this isn't a good time.

24:41.956 --> 24:43.248
Why, is Anna still asleep?

24:43.332 --> 24:46.126
No, she's on her way to your house
to get ready for your folks' party.

24:46.210 --> 24:50.506
Then, this is a great time.
We can pick up right where we left off.

24:51.465 --> 24:53.884
I don't know about you,
but I didn't get much sleep.

24:53.967 --> 24:56.053
Yeah, I was up for a while.

24:56.136 --> 24:57.888
So, can I come in?

25:00.641 --> 25:03.227
- You better go.
- Why? What's wrong?

25:03.602 --> 25:05.646
Well, if it isn't Brandon Walsh.

25:07.147 --> 25:08.398
This is a nice surprise.

25:08.482 --> 25:10.609
- How are your parents?
- Fine, thanks.

25:10.692 --> 25:12.861
Good, good, good. Say hello for me.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.280
Did you come to give Anna a ride?

25:15.364 --> 25:18.825
No, actually, I came to take Carla
to breakfast in Beverly Hills,

25:18.909 --> 25:21.828
- and I brought you some pastries.
- Oh, no, no, no, none for me.

25:21.912 --> 25:26.083
I don't think Carla has time
for breakfast this morning, do you?

25:26.666 --> 25:29.461
I can't today. I'll talk to you later.

25:31.630 --> 25:32.756
I just don't trust him.

25:32.839 --> 25:35.008
- What's his name?
- Richard.

25:35.091 --> 25:38.512
He's Anna's cousin or uncle
or something.

25:38.720 --> 25:42.224
Every time I ask Carla about her family,
she changes the subject

25:42.307 --> 25:44.809
like she's embarrassed or ashamed.

25:44.893 --> 25:46.728
Well, weren't you with her last night?

25:46.811 --> 25:48.521
Come on, Walsh.

25:49.898 --> 25:52.150
Oh, if it isn't Dylan, the wild surfman.

25:52.233 --> 25:54.361
Hey, don't tell me
it wasn't cold out there this morning.

25:54.444 --> 25:56.655
Oh, no, man. It was happening.
Waves were breaking.

25:56.738 --> 25:57.947
We missed you.

25:58.031 --> 26:01.201
Hey, that's the same shirt I ordered
from Brenda's catalogue.

26:01.284 --> 26:03.203
Yeah, I'm supposed to
get some baggies tonight.

26:03.286 --> 26:04.662
The party's still on, right?

26:04.746 --> 26:06.289
You mean the social event
of the season?

26:06.372 --> 26:08.541
- Is Carla going to be there?
- I wish.

26:08.625 --> 26:12.712
- Well, you invited her, didn't you?
- Well, she didn't give me a chance.

26:12.796 --> 26:16.257
Besides, she said
she'd probably have to work tonight.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.717
Hey, hey!

26:45.870 --> 26:47.371
- Oh, hi, Carla.
- Hi.

26:47.455 --> 26:49.248
Anna tells me
you've been enjoying West Beverly

26:49.332 --> 26:50.792
a little more
than you thought you would.

26:50.875 --> 26:53.711
- I do. Thank you.
- She never stops reading, this one.

26:53.794 --> 26:56.631
- She's going to be a lawyer, eh?
- Really? That's great!

26:56.714 --> 26:58.466
Maybe. We'll see what happens.

26:58.549 --> 27:00.551
By any chance, do you have any rings
or some ribbons

27:00.635 --> 27:02.511
so I could tie a bow
around the napkins like this?

27:02.595 --> 27:05.765
Now, why didn't I think of that?
Yes, I have some napkin rings.

27:05.848 --> 27:08.351
They are in the dining room
in the top drawer.

27:10.645 --> 27:14.231
She's such a talented girl.
This must be a nightmare for her.

27:14.315 --> 27:15.566
It is.

27:16.359 --> 27:17.485
Hi, Mom. Hi, Anna.

27:17.568 --> 27:19.195
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:19.820 --> 27:21.822
How are things going here
at party central?

27:21.906 --> 27:24.658
Everything's under control,
thanks to Anna and the gang.

27:24.742 --> 27:27.578
Smells a lot better here
than it did at the Pit.

27:28.370 --> 27:30.789
- Oh, come on.
- Be my guest.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.254
Brandon.

27:38.672 --> 27:40.132
Hey, Carla.

27:41.926 --> 27:44.053
This is great.
I thought you had to work tonight.

27:44.136 --> 27:45.596
I am working.

27:45.679 --> 27:49.183
One of Anna's servers got sick,
so she asked me to fill in.

27:49.266 --> 27:52.770
Well, I was going to invite you tonight
as my guest.

27:53.145 --> 27:55.230
I wanted to introduce you to my parents.

27:55.314 --> 27:59.860
I met them. They're both really terrific.
Of course, I'm not surprised.

28:02.154 --> 28:05.073
After last night, how can you work here?

28:05.908 --> 28:08.952
I'm just helping out.
What's the big deal?

28:10.370 --> 28:13.165
- I have to do this now.
- No, you don't.

28:17.210 --> 28:19.046
I don't want Carla to work here.

28:19.129 --> 28:20.797
Why not? She's doing a great job.

28:20.881 --> 28:23.634
I just don't feel right
about having friends of mine serve me.

28:23.717 --> 28:26.345
Honey, you serve your friends
at the Peach Pit all the time.

28:26.428 --> 28:28.722
That's different.
That's a place of business.

28:28.805 --> 28:32.100
- This is in our house.
- I just don't see the difference.

28:32.184 --> 28:35.562
- Fine. Take me off the guest list.
- Brandon!

28:35.645 --> 28:39.357
Anna, if you need
an extra pair of hands, I'm available.

28:44.446 --> 28:46.823
Hey, Brandon, the clothes came.

28:49.326 --> 28:51.703
Chick sent us stuff
that's not even in the catalogue yet.

28:51.786 --> 28:53.538
They are so rude. I love them.

28:53.622 --> 28:56.625
Which did you order,
the green or the orange-fuchsia?

28:56.708 --> 28:58.710
I don't know, Brenda, and I don't care,
okay?

28:58.793 --> 28:59.961
What's with you?

29:00.045 --> 29:02.339
I can't believe Mom would hire Carla
to work here.

29:02.422 --> 29:04.883
Well, why not? Mom doesn't know
how you feel about her.

29:04.966 --> 29:07.093
- That's not the point.
- Yes, that is the point.

29:07.177 --> 29:09.304
You don't tell Mom how you feel,
and she doesn't tell us

29:09.387 --> 29:12.891
why she and Dad were willing to lie
in order to get Carla into school.

29:12.974 --> 29:15.185
They did it
so she could get a better education.

29:15.268 --> 29:17.187
That's what they say.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.064
Brandon, what's going on?

29:20.148 --> 29:22.525
Your mother says you're getting
bent out of shape over nothing.

29:22.609 --> 29:26.070
- It's not nothing, Dad.
- This is where I say adios.

29:28.698 --> 29:31.951
- You don't understand.
- No, you don't understand.

29:32.035 --> 29:34.621
CS Pacific is the first gold-star client
I've picked up

29:34.704 --> 29:36.289
since we moved to California.

29:36.372 --> 29:39.626
For me to be working
with Chick Schneider is a major coup.

29:39.709 --> 29:43.254
Now, what I need from you is
for you to be a gracious and happy host

29:43.338 --> 29:46.466
who makes sure that all of our guests
are having a good time.

29:46.549 --> 29:49.218
Do you think you can do that for me?

29:55.266 --> 29:58.060
<i>Good evening,
welcome to Casa de Walsh.</i>

29:59.604 --> 30:02.356
Can I interest you in a cocktail?

30:02.440 --> 30:06.277
- The margaritas are going fast.
- Thanks. That sounds great.

30:07.194 --> 30:09.822
Cindy, you remember Becky
and Alan Wilerson?

30:09.906 --> 30:11.949
Oh, yes. Hi. How are you?

30:12.033 --> 30:15.745
You have a lovely home,
and such a handsome bartender.

30:15.828 --> 30:17.913
- Oh, thank you.
- Well, enjoy.

30:19.498 --> 30:21.542
Well, at least he's being pleasant
to our guests,

30:21.625 --> 30:23.169
even if he's not speaking to us.

30:23.252 --> 30:26.505
- Well, just two more hours and it's over.
- Yeah, just keep on breathing.

30:26.589 --> 30:28.424
Mom, do you know
where the camera is?

30:28.507 --> 30:29.967
Chick wants to take
some pictures of us.

30:30.050 --> 30:32.428
Yeah, he says he wants to use us
in his next catalogue.

30:32.511 --> 30:35.347
Well, I don't blame him. You girls look...

30:35.431 --> 30:39.643
What's the hip word? Def? Dope? Rad?

30:39.727 --> 30:42.104
- Oh, my God.
- Foxy.

30:42.855 --> 30:46.066
- Do you want another one?
- Oh, these tacos are great, Carla.

30:46.150 --> 30:50.613
- I've never tasted a taco like this.
- That's because they're flautas.

30:52.323 --> 30:54.366
Well, you didn't know that either, Kelly.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.618
Have you tried one of these, Mr Walsh?

30:56.702 --> 30:59.580
Thanks, Carla. Can you see
if Mr Schneider needs anything?

30:59.663 --> 31:00.831
Okay.

31:01.331 --> 31:04.668
You have got to remember,
when we started surfing in North Shore,

31:04.752 --> 31:07.379
I mean, those boards
still weighed 2,000 pounds.

31:07.463 --> 31:09.339
If you got clunked
with one of those monsters,

31:09.423 --> 31:11.467
I mean, you were one dead tuna.

31:12.301 --> 31:15.888
- Can I get you anything else?
- Oh, thanks, sweetheart,

31:16.847 --> 31:19.933
but I think I'll slurp another one of these.

31:20.350 --> 31:22.769
Preferably with you in the dark.

31:24.771 --> 31:27.649
- It's a good thing Walsh didn't hear that.
- Yeah.

31:27.733 --> 31:31.028
He's really flipped for her
in a major way, huh?

31:35.282 --> 31:37.409
Hey, Carla, could you help me
bring some extra chairs

31:37.492 --> 31:39.703
down from my parents' room?

31:39.911 --> 31:43.749
Look, I said I was sorry about before.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

31:43.832 --> 31:46.042
You're the one who's embarrassed,
Brandon. Not me.

31:46.126 --> 31:49.504
Seeing you just caught me by surprise,
that's all.

31:50.589 --> 31:52.591
Why are you still being so cold to me?

31:52.674 --> 31:55.218
Look, I'm just trying to be conscientious.

31:59.306 --> 32:01.182
Where are the chairs?

32:02.475 --> 32:05.979
- This isn't your parents' room.
- No, this is my room.

32:06.604 --> 32:08.189
- Brandon, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

32:08.273 --> 32:11.401
I'm just tired of watching you
be conscientious.

32:11.484 --> 32:14.696
- What do you want, Brandon?
- What do you think?

32:17.657 --> 32:19.451
Are you happy now?

32:20.493 --> 32:21.744
What's the matter with you?

32:21.828 --> 32:24.539
I don't like being told how I should feel
or what I should think!

32:24.622 --> 32:27.584
Why don't you tell that to Richard?
He's obviously got something on you.

32:27.667 --> 32:29.294
Brandon, I don't need you to protect me.

32:29.377 --> 32:31.671
I don't want to protect you!

32:32.422 --> 32:35.258
I just want it to be like it was last night.

32:35.341 --> 32:37.510
That was last night, Brandon.

32:37.594 --> 32:40.972
Tonight, I'm working at a fancy party
in Beverly Hills,

32:41.055 --> 32:45.226
and I would appreciate it if you would
let me go downstairs and do my work.

33:11.168 --> 33:15.047
- It's not what you think.
- Richard told you to stay away from him.

33:15.131 --> 33:18.342
- It's not my fault.
- I don't care whose fault it is.

33:18.426 --> 33:20.386
You show some respect
for these people.

33:20.469 --> 33:24.056
- I have respect for them.
- Well, then, show some respect for me.

33:31.981 --> 33:34.817
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

33:42.241 --> 33:43.951
Okay, everybody.

33:44.410 --> 33:46.745
Oh, Brandon, smile.

33:46.829 --> 33:48.581
Kelly, tickle him.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.876
Okay, just one more.

33:53.294 --> 33:55.462
Oh, that was great. Thanks.

33:55.963 --> 34:00.092
You've got beautiful kids, Jim.
One more beautiful than the next.

34:00.175 --> 34:02.469
They especially look good
wearing your spring line.

34:02.553 --> 34:05.180
Oh, thanks.
We expect big things this season.

34:05.264 --> 34:07.891
We just opened a new factory
in Mexicali.

34:07.975 --> 34:10.268
- We should've done this 10 years ago.
- Oh?

34:10.351 --> 34:12.646
Yeah, well,
there is a language problem,

34:12.728 --> 34:15.815
but those people work hard,
and they work cheap.

34:15.899 --> 34:19.194
- How much do you pay them?
- Why? You need a job?

34:20.279 --> 34:23.657
No, thanks. I already have a job
that pays a fair wage.

34:23.739 --> 34:26.868
I just don't like to hear
about people being exploited.

34:26.952 --> 34:29.496
- Brandon.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

34:29.788 --> 34:32.040
It just seems to me
that the people who make his swimsuits

34:32.123 --> 34:33.542
ought to get something out of it

34:33.625 --> 34:36.962
so their relatives don't have to chase
after the work trucks in East LA.

34:37.045 --> 34:39.547
Brandon, you apologize right now!

34:44.052 --> 34:48.556
Hey, there's no need for that.
Who knows? He's probably right.

34:49.808 --> 34:51.226
Let's eat.

35:06.616 --> 35:09.619
- Carla, wait.
- Brandon, you were right.

35:09.911 --> 35:11.871
It wasn't a good idea
for me to come here.

35:11.955 --> 35:13.456
This was a big mistake.

35:16.459 --> 35:18.503
Please, let her go.

35:28.304 --> 35:31.266
Here you go, Anna, and again,
thank you so much for everything.

35:31.349 --> 35:32.934
Oh, thank you.

35:34.018 --> 35:36.813
- Good night, Anna.
- Good night. See you on Tuesday.

35:36.896 --> 35:38.439
- Good, bye-bye.
- Bye.

35:39.732 --> 35:43.570
- So, should we do this again next week?
- Why wait? Why not tomorrow?

35:43.778 --> 35:48.408
- Hey, great party, you guys.
- Well, I think it was a rousing success

35:48.491 --> 35:51.035
with one minor exception.

35:52.578 --> 35:55.998
- Well, I'm going to bed.
- Wait, I'll come with you.

35:56.082 --> 35:58.292
- Night, Brenda.
- Good night.

36:07.135 --> 36:09.846
- You need any help?
- No, I got it.

36:11.764 --> 36:15.309
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

36:17.019 --> 36:19.313
Do you ever have one of those days
where you wish you could just

36:19.397 --> 36:22.191
turn the clock back and start all over?

36:23.442 --> 36:25.778
I mean,
everyone in the world is furious at me.

36:25.861 --> 36:29.448
Mom, Dad, Anna, Carla, you.

36:29.865 --> 36:32.159
I'm not mad at you, Brandon.

36:32.410 --> 36:34.245
Thanks for sticking by me, Bren.

36:34.328 --> 36:37.915
But I do think you've been unbearably
obnoxious this whole past week.

36:37.998 --> 36:40.376
- Thanks.
- Well, what do you want me to say?

36:40.459 --> 36:42.837
You've been totally consumed
with Carla.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.547
You've clearly lost
your sense of humor

36:44.630 --> 36:45.881
about her and everything else.

36:45.965 --> 36:48.050
Well, maybe you can tell me
how I'm supposed to yuck it up

36:48.133 --> 36:51.011
when the girl I'm falling for
just walked out the door for no reason.

36:51.095 --> 36:52.721
Well, maybe she had a reason.

36:52.805 --> 36:55.224
Maybe there's stuff going on with her
you don't even know about.

36:55.307 --> 36:56.392
Like what?

36:56.475 --> 36:58.394
Like why her Uncle Richard
was parked outside

36:58.477 --> 37:00.229
the whole time the party was going on.

37:00.312 --> 37:02.606
- He was?
- Yeah, Dylan saw him.

37:02.815 --> 37:07.111
And when Carla tore out of the house,
she went straight to his car.

37:09.154 --> 37:13.367
That Richard guy is bad news.
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

37:20.499 --> 37:22.251
Can I talk to you?

37:23.043 --> 37:26.880
You mean there's a chance
we can be on speaking terms again?

37:26.964 --> 37:28.715
Oh, come on, Dad.

37:29.341 --> 37:32.135
I apologized to you.
I apologized to Chick.

37:32.219 --> 37:35.305
I know I was out of line.
What more can I do?

37:38.308 --> 37:41.853
We're just lucky the man has
a great sense of humor.

37:44.940 --> 37:46.316
I don't get it.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.902
Your behavior tonight
was so unlike you.

37:48.985 --> 37:51.988
Well, I'm confused, Dad,

37:54.199 --> 37:55.909
and I guess
it really burns me up to think

37:55.992 --> 37:59.955
there are things going on around here
that are purposely being kept from me.

38:00.038 --> 38:01.581
You know,
Brenda's been saying all along

38:01.665 --> 38:03.083
you weren't the kind of people who'd lie

38:03.166 --> 38:04.876
to help someone's niece
get into a better school,

38:04.960 --> 38:06.878
even someone as sweet as Anna.

38:06.962 --> 38:09.089
So, what's the story, Dad?

38:09.673 --> 38:12.259
You been keeping something from us?

38:12.676 --> 38:16.137
- We like Carla very much.
- No, not as much as I do.

38:17.430 --> 38:19.724
Dad, I've never felt this way
about anybody before.

38:19.808 --> 38:21.768
You gotta tell me what's going on.

38:21.851 --> 38:24.062
We can't tell you, Brandon.

38:24.688 --> 38:28.149
We made promises to these people.
We have to keep our word.

38:28.233 --> 38:29.442
I'm sorry, honey.

38:29.526 --> 38:32.821
It just never dawned on us
that you and Carla might get together.

38:32.904 --> 38:37.283
Yeah, well, we did.
At least we were trying to until tonight.

38:37.408 --> 38:41.162
If we'd known it was going to cause you
this much grief,

38:41.246 --> 38:44.374
- we would have said no.
- No question about it.

38:44.958 --> 38:47.794
Can you at least tell me
who Richard is?

38:48.169 --> 38:50.672
I think you better talk to Carla.

39:04.394 --> 39:06.729
Hi, Anna. Can I talk to Carla?

39:07.438 --> 39:10.149
No, she's... She's not here, Brandon.

39:10.650 --> 39:15.363
- Can I wait for her to come back?
- She's not coming back, Brandon.

39:16.322 --> 39:20.451
- Is she in trouble?
- No, not any more, thank God!

39:21.577 --> 39:23.955
She's gone back to her family.

39:24.247 --> 39:28.125
I know she'd like to see you again,
if only to say goodbye.

39:31.671 --> 39:33.214
Don't eat too many of those.

39:35.341 --> 39:37.551
Here you go. Anything else?

40:02.743 --> 40:04.328
If you can't give me another chance,

40:04.411 --> 40:07.206
can you at least give me
an explanation?

40:16.757 --> 40:19.301
Have you ever heard of Victor Montez?

40:19.385 --> 40:22.221
- Is he famous?
- To some people.

40:22.304 --> 40:24.098
He heads
the Department of Hispanic Culture

40:24.181 --> 40:26.725
at the Kenmont colleges in Pomona.

40:26.809 --> 40:28.685
He's also my father.

40:29.895 --> 40:32.689
- So, why do you live with Anna?
- I don't.

40:32.773 --> 40:35.400
I just moved to East LA last week.

40:35.734 --> 40:36.860
Why?

40:37.653 --> 40:39.238
Anna was my babysitter.

40:39.321 --> 40:42.282
I live with my parents
and my sisters at the university,

40:42.366 --> 40:46.161
but I also do volunteer work
at the projects near Dogtown,

40:46.244 --> 40:48.038
which is where I saw two lowlifes

40:48.121 --> 40:50.415
named Ruben Benequez
and Sleepy Saloman

40:50.499 --> 40:52.417
drive by a house three times

40:52.501 --> 40:55.379
before they pulled out their guns
and opened fire.

40:55.462 --> 40:57.005
You saw that?

40:57.464 --> 41:00.675
And I saw the bullets ricochet
into the brain of a four-year-old boy

41:00.759 --> 41:03.136
on his way to a birthday party.

41:04.262 --> 41:05.722
Oh, my God.

41:06.264 --> 41:08.308
And when Ruben let it be known that

41:08.391 --> 41:10.435
whoever came forward
to testify against him

41:10.519 --> 41:13.188
would not live a long
and prosperous life,

41:13.271 --> 41:16.566
Richard thought I should disappear
until the case came to court.

41:16.650 --> 41:18.443
Maybe for a year.

41:18.526 --> 41:22.072
And that's when Anna mentioned that
your folks might be able to help me out.

41:22.155 --> 41:23.990
So, Richard's a cop?

41:24.866 --> 41:27.952
Prosecuting attorney.
I was his star witness.

41:28.370 --> 41:31.706
- No wonder he was always dogging you.
- Not anymore.

41:31.790 --> 41:35.043
Sleepy broke down
and confessed to the murder last night.

41:35.126 --> 41:37.670
So, you're off the hook?
You don't have to testify?

41:37.754 --> 41:42.091
Yeah. And now I can go back home
and to my old school.

41:43.635 --> 41:46.179
- And you like it out there.
- Brandon...

41:46.262 --> 41:48.556
How far out is Pomona anyway?

41:49.724 --> 41:52.810
It's on the other side of the world,
Brandon.

41:54.062 --> 41:55.897
What are you saying?

41:56.898 --> 42:00.610
I'm just saying that
I'm not expecting anything from you.

42:00.693 --> 42:02.987
What if I want you to expect something?

42:03.071 --> 42:06.115
What? That you'll pledge
your undying devotion to me,

42:06.199 --> 42:08.409
and that I should do the same?

42:08.493 --> 42:12.914
I'm not a poor girl from the barrio
who's looking for a white knight.

42:15.041 --> 42:17.043
Is that how you saw me?

42:18.836 --> 42:22.632
Being with you was like a dream,
like a fairy tale,

42:24.091 --> 42:27.386
but now it's over,
and I have to go home now.

42:27.970 --> 42:31.974
- Why?
- Oh, Brandon. I said it was complicated.

42:32.058 --> 42:35.853
I disagree.
I don't think it is that complicated.

42:35.937 --> 42:39.815
And when it comes down to it,
I don't think you and I are that different.

42:39.899 --> 42:41.233
I agree.

42:41.859 --> 42:44.487
And that's what scares me the most.

42:47.490 --> 42:50.993
With you, it would be so easy for me
to forget who I am

42:51.077 --> 42:53.037
and where I come from.

42:53.537 --> 42:55.790
I don't want that to happen.

43:01.629 --> 43:06.675
- I really didn't know you at all, did I?
- Oh, you knew me better than you think.

43:13.098 --> 43:16.727
Yeah. Well, maybe sometime
when you come into town,

43:16.810 --> 43:19.396
you could meet me on Olvera Street.

43:20.898 --> 43:23.692
I'd like that. I really would.

43:27.112 --> 43:31.950
- Take care of yourself, Brandon.
- Yeah, you, too.

43:54.681 --> 43:57.976
I distinctly told you number 169B.
Remember?

43:58.060 --> 44:01.396
I pointed it out to you in the catalogue,
169B. I told you!

44:01.480 --> 44:04.399
Well, you know pink's
my favorite color.

44:05.484 --> 44:09.112
So, new clothes, new earrings.
What else is new?

44:10.614 --> 44:12.073
Dylan, I saw that.

44:12.157 --> 44:14.409
Oh, no, no, no.
Brenda, she looked at me first.

44:14.493 --> 44:15.869
Oh, yeah.

44:16.244 --> 44:19.831
You know... You know that piece
you did on Coach Cass?

44:19.915 --> 44:23.585
- Yeah, I know it. I wrote it.
- I didn't change a comma.

44:23.793 --> 44:26.338
I think it's your best piece yet.

44:26.588 --> 44:28.214
Thanks, Andrea.

44:28.298 --> 44:31.551
Don't thank me. You wrote it.

44:35.263 --> 44:37.098
I wish it could be like this with everyone.

44:37.182 --> 44:38.349
Like what?

44:38.433 --> 44:40.977
You know, how we are with each other.

44:41.061 --> 44:43.813
Easy. Comfortable. Real.

44:44.397 --> 44:46.065
Yeah, it's nice.

44:46.232 --> 44:49.694
I'm just glad we're
not attracted to each other romantically,

44:49.777 --> 44:53.156
so we can always be friends.
Good friends.

44:53.573 --> 44:56.284
Just friends. It's great.

44:59.078 --> 45:00.288
Yeah.

45:02.498 --> 45:04.417
Okay, don't hang up. Just don't hang up.

45:04.500 --> 45:07.462
Now, this is David Silver,
the voice of West Beverly High,

45:07.545 --> 45:08.838
and I really don't care

45:08.921 --> 45:11.215
if he doesn't want to come
to our homecoming dance

45:11.299 --> 45:15.219
<i>or that MC Hammer's one of the top
recording and video artists in the world,</i>

45:15.887 --> 45:20.433
but at least you could put my call
through one time without hanging up.

45:21.100 --> 45:24.979
<i>So, having said all that,
can I please talk to MC Hammer?</i>

45:25.062 --> 45:26.731
MC Hammer?

45:26.814 --> 45:29.484
Sorry, I think you have
the wrong number. Bye.

45:37.867 --> 45:39.410
Debbie Gibson?

45:49.128 --> 45:51.881
<i>Debbie Gibson, look,
this is David Silver,</i>

45:51.964 --> 45:54.759
<i>I've been trying to reach you all week.</i>

45:55.305 --> 46:01.887
