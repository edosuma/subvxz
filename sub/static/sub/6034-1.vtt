02:34.294 --> 02:36.159
Good morning, Bastian.

02:56.283 --> 03:00.117
I had another dream, Dad, about Mom.

03:04.524 --> 03:06.185
I understand, son.

03:08.095 --> 03:10.586
But we have to get on with things, right?

03:23.510 --> 03:26.172
Bastian, we each have responsibilities.

03:28.181 --> 03:29.978
We can't let Mom's death...

03:31.051 --> 03:33.986
...be an excuse
for not getting the job done, right?

03:35.155 --> 03:36.144
Yes.

03:52.205 --> 03:54.696
Son, it's time you and I had a talk.

03:58.879 --> 04:01.939
I got a call from your math teacher
yesterday.

04:05.852 --> 04:07.581
She says that you were...

04:07.921 --> 04:10.151
...drawing horses in your math book.

04:10.457 --> 04:12.948
Unicorns. They were unicorns.

04:13.593 --> 04:14.491
What?

04:16.897 --> 04:17.726
Nothing.

04:17.898 --> 04:21.231
She also says you don't
do your homework on time.

04:25.438 --> 04:28.669
I'm very disappointed you didn't even
try out for the swimming team.

04:31.144 --> 04:33.738
As to those riding lessons you wanted...

04:34.781 --> 04:38.945
You say you love horses
but you're afraid to get on a real one.

04:41.021 --> 04:45.014
You're old enough to get your head down
out of the clouds and...

04:45.959 --> 04:48.291
...and keep both feet on the ground.

04:51.464 --> 04:52.624
Okay.

05:00.173 --> 05:04.837
Stop daydreaming.
Start facing your problems. Okay?

05:09.616 --> 05:13.677
There, I think we've had a nice talk.

05:14.487 --> 05:16.546
We should have more.

05:16.623 --> 05:19.615
Have a good day, son.
Don't be late for school again.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.451
But, yesterday I wasn't.

05:27.968 --> 05:30.300
Hey, it's the weirdo.

05:31.471 --> 05:34.463
Weirdo, you got any cash for us today?

05:39.813 --> 05:41.610
Let's get him!

05:51.191 --> 05:52.658
You can't get away.

05:52.993 --> 05:54.824
You're dead, chicken!

05:54.928 --> 05:56.156
We'll get you!

05:59.499 --> 06:01.660
- Where's your money?
- I don't have any!

06:01.735 --> 06:04.135
No money? Mamma's boy is holding out.

06:05.238 --> 06:08.002
If you ain't got money,
you go in the garbage.

06:16.716 --> 06:19.583
Maybe the chicken can lay an egg in there.

06:26.559 --> 06:29.357
Who said you could get out of the garbage?

06:29.429 --> 06:31.192
Get back in there.

06:31.264 --> 06:32.629
Not again.

06:33.566 --> 06:34.658
Not again!

06:34.734 --> 06:36.565
Where are you going, wimp?

06:45.512 --> 06:47.946
- He went that way.
- Which way?

06:53.086 --> 06:56.078
Get out of here! I don't like kids.

07:11.604 --> 07:14.505
Are you still here? Didn't you hear me?

07:15.075 --> 07:16.542
You're hiding, aren't you?

07:17.777 --> 07:19.642
The video arcade is down the street.

07:20.447 --> 07:24.781
Here we just sell small rectangular objects.
They're called books.

07:25.452 --> 07:28.387
They require effort and make no beeps.

07:28.455 --> 07:29.444
On your way.

07:29.522 --> 07:33.390
I know books. I have 186 of them at home.

07:33.927 --> 07:34.951
Comic books.

07:35.028 --> 07:36.859
No, I've read <i>Treasure Island...</i>

07:37.030 --> 07:39.328
...<i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, <i>Wizard of Oz</i>...

07:39.399 --> 07:42.368
...<i>Lord of the Rings</i>,
<i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan.</i>

07:47.107 --> 07:49.098
Who are you running away from?

07:53.813 --> 07:55.474
Some kids from school.

07:56.383 --> 07:57.247
Why?

07:58.585 --> 08:00.450
They threw me in the garbage.

08:00.687 --> 08:02.678
Why not punch them in the nose?

08:05.992 --> 08:07.482
I don't know.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.491
What's that book about?

08:17.036 --> 08:20.199
Oh, this is something special.

08:26.513 --> 08:28.504
Well, what is it?

08:31.351 --> 08:32.249
Look.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.182
Your books are safe.

08:37.524 --> 08:39.355
While you're reading them...

08:39.525 --> 08:44.463
...you get to become
Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.

08:44.531 --> 08:46.692
But that's what I like about them.

08:46.866 --> 08:50.700
But afterwards you get to be
a little boy again.

08:51.037 --> 08:53.028
What do you mean?

08:53.540 --> 08:54.700
Listen.

08:57.377 --> 08:58.901
Have you ever been...

09:00.013 --> 09:01.378
...Captain Nemo...

09:02.215 --> 09:07.175
...trapped inside your submarine
while the giant squid is attacking you?

09:09.823 --> 09:10.653
Yes.

09:10.890 --> 09:13.381
Weren't you afraid you couldn't escape?

09:14.060 --> 09:15.652
But it's only a story.

09:15.895 --> 09:18.386
That's what I'm talking about.

09:19.065 --> 09:20.896
The ones you read...

09:21.234 --> 09:22.394
...are safe.

09:25.738 --> 09:27.228
And that one isn't?

09:29.742 --> 09:31.266
Don't worry about it.

09:31.411 --> 09:33.902
But you just said it was...

09:41.855 --> 09:43.516
Forget about it.

09:44.224 --> 09:47.421
This book is not for you.

09:57.136 --> 09:58.626
Koreander's.

10:00.740 --> 10:02.731
What can I do for you?

10:10.650 --> 10:12.982
They run maybe 300, 370...

10:13.653 --> 10:15.518
It will take me a couple of a weeks.

11:08.841 --> 11:11.674
Math test. Oh, no!

12:15.508 --> 12:18.671
<i>"It was midnight in the Howling Forest.</i>

12:19.012 --> 12:23.176
<i>"The wind whistled</i>
<i>through the tops of the ancient trees.</i>

12:23.516 --> 12:25.848
<i>"Suddenly, something enormous...</i>

12:26.052 --> 12:29.886
<i>"...crashed and rumbled</i>
<i>through the eerie woods. "</i>

12:55.782 --> 12:56.942
What's that?

13:33.086 --> 13:34.678
Excuse me...

13:35.121 --> 13:39.114
...but would it be all right
if I joined you this evening?

13:41.427 --> 13:45.761
You see, I've been traveling all day.

14:11.124 --> 14:15.060
Now I see why you picked this camp.

14:26.639 --> 14:30.131
A delicious looking limestone rock!

14:33.813 --> 14:35.713
Nice bouquet.

14:36.315 --> 14:40.046
Must be a real vintage year.

14:42.088 --> 14:44.079
Yes, you're right.

14:44.524 --> 14:47.584
Those delicious rocks
are the reason we've camped here.

14:49.428 --> 14:53.023
- Is he a nutcase?
- No, he's a Rock Biter.

14:53.232 --> 14:54.460
A Rock Biter!

15:10.283 --> 15:12.615
- Sorry.
- Poor baby.

15:17.089 --> 15:18.613
Pardon me.

15:20.059 --> 15:24.257
That was limestone, with a dash of quartz.

15:26.032 --> 15:27.727
Very tasty.

15:28.868 --> 15:33.771
Where I come from in the North,
we us to have exquisite gourmet rocks.

15:36.375 --> 15:37.774
Only now...

15:38.744 --> 15:40.075
...now...

15:41.214 --> 15:43.307
...they're all gone.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.244
I know how it happened.

15:46.919 --> 15:49.410
I swear it wasn't me.

15:51.557 --> 15:53.991
I think I know what it was. Tell us more.

15:54.060 --> 15:58.360
Near my home,
there used to be a beautiful lake...

15:59.198 --> 16:00.529
...but then...

16:01.100 --> 16:03.933
...then it was gone.

16:04.370 --> 16:06.235
Did the lake dry up?

16:06.873 --> 16:09.637
No. It just wasn't there anymore.

16:09.909 --> 16:14.573
Nothing was there anymore.
Not even a dried-up lake.

16:15.448 --> 16:16.346
A hole?

16:16.415 --> 16:20.579
A hole would be something.
No, it was Nothing.

16:21.487 --> 16:24.945
And it got bigger and bigger.

16:26.092 --> 16:28.788
First, there was no lake anymore.

16:28.861 --> 16:32.592
And then, finally, no rocks.

16:38.771 --> 16:43.367
If he keeps stuffing his face like that,
soon there won't be any rocks here either.

16:44.410 --> 16:46.878
Night Hob, this could be serious!

16:47.580 --> 16:48.808
Rock Biter...

16:48.881 --> 16:52.044
...what you told us is also happening
where I live in the West.

16:52.118 --> 16:55.212
A strange sort of Nothing
is destroying everything.

16:55.288 --> 16:59.725
Yes. We Night Hobs live in the South
and it's there, too.

17:00.092 --> 17:05.928
So, it's not just in our part of Fantasia?

17:06.965 --> 17:10.925
Maybe, it's already everywhere.

17:17.843 --> 17:20.641
Maybe our whole land is in danger.

17:21.681 --> 17:23.012
What can we do?

17:23.316 --> 17:28.049
My people are sending me to
the Ivory Tower, to the Empress, for help.

17:28.220 --> 17:29.881
We are on the same...

17:30.656 --> 17:35.320
We are on the same mission.
After all, if the Empress can't save us...

17:35.661 --> 17:36.889
...who could?

17:36.996 --> 17:39.487
Then why are we all just sitting here...

17:39.966 --> 17:42.764
...instead of taking off for the Ivory Tower?

17:43.402 --> 17:45.063
What are we waiting for?

17:45.137 --> 17:47.435
Yes. Let's go now.

17:47.540 --> 17:48.973
Wake up!

17:49.208 --> 17:50.607
Come on, old girl.

17:50.676 --> 17:52.667
We can't just hang around here.

17:53.646 --> 17:55.580
Wake up! Ready for takeoff.

17:55.848 --> 17:57.782
Oh, stupid bat!

17:58.351 --> 18:02.310
We can't wait for a snail. Can I carry you?

18:02.388 --> 18:05.755
Don't worry. It's a racing snail.

18:06.525 --> 18:10.655
But we can't even wait for a racing snail.

18:13.966 --> 18:16.298
It really is a racing snail.

18:16.602 --> 18:19.765
Nobody gives a hoot
about me and my stupid bat.

18:30.116 --> 18:35.884
Maybe I'll take a few of these
yummy gourmet rocks, for the road...

19:00.780 --> 19:02.008
The Nothing!

19:18.531 --> 19:19.520
Look!

19:20.966 --> 19:22.627
There it is!

19:23.402 --> 19:26.064
The heart of Fantasia!

19:46.759 --> 19:50.718
I never knew it was that beautiful.

20:04.844 --> 20:05.970
Stay awake!

20:08.247 --> 20:10.238
I told you to stay awake.

20:57.663 --> 20:59.995
The home of the Empress.

21:01.066 --> 21:02.658
She's our only hope.

21:36.468 --> 21:39.699
Friends, I know why you are all here.

21:41.106 --> 21:42.437
The Nothing...

21:45.177 --> 21:47.338
...is destroying our world.

21:49.782 --> 21:52.114
I also know that you...

21:52.618 --> 21:54.950
...have come to beseech...

21:56.121 --> 21:57.952
...the Empress for help.

22:02.328 --> 22:04.319
But I have terrible news.

22:07.633 --> 22:09.828
The Empress herself
has become deathly ill.

22:13.105 --> 22:17.974
There seems to be a mysterious link
between her illness and the Nothing.

22:20.579 --> 22:22.240
She's dying.

22:26.919 --> 22:30.650
So, she cannot save us.

22:33.826 --> 22:35.987
But there just might be one chance.

22:40.499 --> 22:43.662
The Plains People
who hunt the purple buffalo...

22:44.003 --> 22:46.164
...have among them a great warrior.

22:46.505 --> 22:50.669
He alone has a chance
to fight the Nothing and save us.

22:52.378 --> 22:54.369
He is our only hope.

22:57.016 --> 23:00.076
His name is Atreyu.

23:19.538 --> 23:21.199
Atreyu.

23:31.250 --> 23:34.651
<i>"The Empress had already</i>
<i>sent for the great warrior.</i>

23:35.554 --> 23:39.320
<i>"When he finally appeared</i>
<i>on the terrace of the Ivory Tower...</i>

23:40.059 --> 23:44.052
<i>"...he carried with him</i>
<i>the hopes of all Fantasia. "</i>

24:01.146 --> 24:03.307
A little boy!

24:04.283 --> 24:08.117
I'm sorry, but this is not
the time nor place for children.

24:09.488 --> 24:10.750
You must leave.

24:11.090 --> 24:14.082
If you don't want me here,
you shouldn't have sent for me.

24:17.529 --> 24:18.427
Is he a nutcase?

24:18.497 --> 24:21.193
It was not you we sent for.
We wanted Atreyu.

24:21.867 --> 24:23.357
I am Atreyu.

24:25.437 --> 24:27.428
Not Atreyu the Child.

24:27.773 --> 24:29.400
Atreyu the Warrior.

24:29.475 --> 24:32.137
I am the only Atreyu of the Plains People.

24:32.478 --> 24:35.413
But I'll be happy to go back
to hunting the purple buffalo.

24:37.383 --> 24:38.281
Wait!

24:42.454 --> 24:44.115
Come back, please.

24:55.300 --> 24:58.463
If you really are the Atreyu we sent for...

24:58.804 --> 25:01.466
...you would be willing to go on a quest?

25:03.642 --> 25:05.473
Yes, of course.

25:06.612 --> 25:08.273
What kind of a quest?

25:08.547 --> 25:11.038
To find a cure for the Empress...

25:13.318 --> 25:15.309
...and to save our world.

25:16.655 --> 25:19.886
No one can give you any advice
except this:

25:21.894 --> 25:23.555
You must go alone.

25:24.797 --> 25:27.288
You must leave all your weapons behind.

25:30.068 --> 25:32.002
It will be very dangerous.

25:33.839 --> 25:35.466
Any chance of success?

25:37.576 --> 25:38.838
I do not know.

25:39.478 --> 25:41.139
But if you fail...

25:41.680 --> 25:44.171
...the Empress will surely die...

25:44.616 --> 25:47.483
...and our whole world will be destroyed.

26:08.540 --> 26:09.632
When do I begin?

26:12.044 --> 26:14.877
Now. And you must hurry, Atreyu.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.412
The Nothing grows stronger every day.

26:24.022 --> 26:25.216
Take this.

26:34.433 --> 26:35.764
The Auryn!

26:42.040 --> 26:46.374
He who wears the Auryn
speaks for the Empress.

26:46.979 --> 26:49.971
It will guide and protect you.

27:03.028 --> 27:04.154
Wake up.

27:04.329 --> 27:05.921
Farewell, Atreyu.

27:07.266 --> 27:08.927
Take care.

27:46.572 --> 27:48.130
<i>"At the same time...</i>

27:48.206 --> 27:52.233
<i>"...elsewhere in Fantasia,</i>
<i>a Creature of Darkness...</i>

27:52.711 --> 27:55.202
<i>"...also began his quest."</i>

28:17.035 --> 28:21.028
<i>"They had been traveling aimlessly</i>
<i>for almost a week...</i>

28:21.473 --> 28:24.533
<i>"...but they could not find a cure</i>
<i>for the Empress.</i>

28:24.776 --> 28:29.440
<i>"Neither Atreyu nor his horse, Artax,</i>
<i>had the vaguest suspicion...</i>

28:29.881 --> 28:33.214
<i>"...that the Creature of Darkness,</i>
<i>the Gmork...</i>

28:33.619 --> 28:36.281
<i>"...was already tracking them down."</i>

28:45.731 --> 28:47.221
What is it, Artax?

28:48.400 --> 28:51.597
Is it time to go already?

28:54.072 --> 28:57.405
I know what you want. It's time to eat.

29:01.813 --> 29:02.905
Good idea.

29:03.215 --> 29:05.445
No, it's a great idea!

29:25.303 --> 29:27.737
No, not too much.

29:28.607 --> 29:31.599
We still have a long way to go.

30:35.173 --> 30:39.166
<i>"Atreyu and Artax had searched</i>
<i>the Silver Mountains...</i>

30:39.344 --> 30:42.677
<i>"...the Desert of Shattered Hopes</i>
<i>and the Crystal Towers...</i>

30:43.281 --> 30:44.908
<i>"...without success.</i>

30:45.484 --> 30:48.476
<i>"And so, there was only one chance left.</i>

30:49.221 --> 30:51.951
<i>"To find Morla, the Ancient One...</i>

30:52.524 --> 30:54.856
<i>"...the wisest being in Fantasia...</i>

30:55.127 --> 30:57.789
<i>"...whose home was the Shell Mountain...</i>

30:57.963 --> 31:02.525
<i>"...somewhere in the deadly</i>
<i>Swamps of Sadness. "</i>

31:11.877 --> 31:14.038
Come on, boy. Come on.

31:27.225 --> 31:28.317
That's it.

31:33.064 --> 31:34.258
It's okay.

31:35.233 --> 31:38.896
<i>"Everyone knew that</i>
<i>whoever let the sadness overtake him...</i>

31:39.471 --> 31:41.564
<i>"...would sink into the swamp."</i>

31:41.907 --> 31:43.636
You're doing fine, Artax.

31:59.024 --> 32:00.651
Come on, Artax.

32:06.364 --> 32:07.763
What's the matter?

32:08.967 --> 32:10.366
What's wrong?

32:16.608 --> 32:17.905
Come on, boy.

32:20.679 --> 32:22.078
What's the matter?

32:23.949 --> 32:25.314
I understand.

32:29.955 --> 32:31.752
It's too difficult for you.

32:35.794 --> 32:38.592
Artax, you're sinking! Come on!

32:38.730 --> 32:41.528
Turn around! You have to! Now!

32:46.905 --> 32:49.066
Fight against the sadness.

32:51.576 --> 32:53.669
Artax, please.

32:53.979 --> 32:56.641
Don't let the sadness
of the swamps get to you.

32:57.148 --> 33:00.481
You have to try. You have to care.

33:01.152 --> 33:03.052
For me.

33:03.121 --> 33:05.681
You're my friend. I love you.

33:10.028 --> 33:12.258
Artax, stupid horse.

33:12.964 --> 33:15.296
You got to move or you'll die.

33:15.667 --> 33:17.601
Move. Please.

33:18.503 --> 33:20.801
I won't give up. Don't quit.

33:20.872 --> 33:22.271
Artax!

34:54.766 --> 34:56.597
The Shell Mountain.

35:02.941 --> 35:05.603
Morla, the Ancient One.

35:49.821 --> 35:50.981
Morla.

36:56.988 --> 37:01.482
But that's impossible.
They couldn't have heard me.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.188
Are you Morla, the Ancient One?

37:10.902 --> 37:15.930
Not that it matters, but yes.

37:16.241 --> 37:19.540
Please help me. Do you recognize this?

37:20.411 --> 37:21.742
Well...

37:22.680 --> 37:25.012
...we haven't seen...

37:25.116 --> 37:29.109
...the Auryn in a long time.

37:29.988 --> 37:30.818
We?

37:33.258 --> 37:35.021
Is there someone else here, too?

37:35.093 --> 37:39.860
We haven't spoken to anyone else...

37:39.931 --> 37:43.594
...for thousands of years.

37:44.102 --> 37:47.799
So we started talking...

37:47.872 --> 37:49.863
...to ourselves.

38:02.353 --> 38:04.583
Morla, I bring terrible news.

38:05.056 --> 38:06.990
Did you know the Empress is ill?

38:07.058 --> 38:10.994
Not that it matters, but yes.

38:11.629 --> 38:14.621
Actually, we don't care.

38:14.799 --> 38:16.699
If I don't save her, she'll die.

38:16.868 --> 38:19.496
There's a terrible Nothing
sweeping over the land.

38:19.571 --> 38:20.902
Don't you care?

38:21.139 --> 38:23.471
We don't even care...

38:24.409 --> 38:27.469
...whether or not we care.

38:34.552 --> 38:35.883
Do you have a cold?

38:35.954 --> 38:40.288
No. We're allergic...

38:41.192 --> 38:42.750
...to youth.

38:47.131 --> 38:49.292
You know how to help the Empress,
don't you?

38:49.367 --> 38:51.892
Not that it matters...

38:52.737 --> 38:54.898
...but yes.

38:54.973 --> 38:59.171
If you don't tell me and the Nothing
keeps coming, you'll die too. Both of you.

38:59.844 --> 39:01.505
Die?

39:02.247 --> 39:05.910
That, at least, would be something.

39:17.428 --> 39:20.022
Please help me.
You said you knew the answer.

39:21.099 --> 39:24.125
We're tired of sneezing.

39:24.202 --> 39:27.968
Go away! Nothing matters.

39:28.506 --> 39:32.408
That's not true.
If it didn't matter to you, you could tell me.

39:36.014 --> 39:37.504
Clever boy.

39:37.682 --> 39:39.047
Tell me, please.

39:39.717 --> 39:41.708
We don't know.

39:42.887 --> 39:45.447
But you can ask...

39:45.723 --> 39:47.987
...the Southern Oracle.

39:48.092 --> 39:49.491
How can I get there?

39:49.560 --> 39:51.221
You can't.

39:52.463 --> 39:57.457
It's 10,000 miles away.

40:00.838 --> 40:02.829
But that's so far.

40:03.041 --> 40:04.702
That's right.

40:05.543 --> 40:07.807
Forget it.

40:09.580 --> 40:11.172
Give up.

41:42.173 --> 41:43.333
No.

41:45.276 --> 41:47.437
Atreyu wouldn't quit now.

43:23.908 --> 43:25.398
Oh, boy!

43:35.686 --> 43:38.780
<i>"After days and nights</i>
<i>of unconsciousness...</i>

43:39.023 --> 43:41.958
<i>"...Atreyu slowly opened his eyes...</i>

43:42.727 --> 43:46.629
<i>"...and found himself</i>
<i>in strange surroundings.</i>

43:47.398 --> 43:50.390
<i>"He was clean and</i>
<i>his wounds were dressed. "</i>

44:49.427 --> 44:51.395
Leaving so soon?

44:59.503 --> 45:01.471
I was just going to...

45:01.906 --> 45:03.601
I have to...

45:04.008 --> 45:06.033
- I was trying to...
- Sneak away?

45:06.110 --> 45:08.578
Yes. I mean, no.

45:08.779 --> 45:10.440
I like children.

45:11.282 --> 45:12.544
For breakfast?

45:14.185 --> 45:17.586
Never. I'm a luck dragon.

45:18.222 --> 45:20.213
My name is Falkor.

45:21.225 --> 45:25.252
- And my name is...
- Atreyu. And you're on a quest.

45:25.429 --> 45:26.760
How did you know that?

45:26.831 --> 45:28.492
You were unconscious.

45:29.367 --> 45:31.130
You talked in your sleep.

45:34.105 --> 45:36.505
Could you get around...

45:37.408 --> 45:40.775
...and scratch behind my right ear?

45:41.612 --> 45:44.775
I can never quite reach it.

45:50.888 --> 45:51.786
Here?

46:02.833 --> 46:05.165
That's so good.

46:06.337 --> 46:07.463
Thank you.

46:10.207 --> 46:15.076
So, little fellow, you're on your way
to the Southern Oracle?

46:15.413 --> 46:17.813
Yes. But it's hopeless.

46:18.449 --> 46:22.476
- It's too far away.
- I wouldn't necessarily say that.

46:23.888 --> 46:25.355
You know how to get there?

46:25.423 --> 46:28.950
Sure. It's right around the corner.

46:29.026 --> 46:30.857
How did all this happen?

46:32.063 --> 46:33.724
With luck.

46:34.732 --> 46:37.633
You brought me the entire 10,000 miles?

46:37.902 --> 46:43.534
No. Only 9,891...

46:43.874 --> 46:45.808
...as the dragon flies.

46:46.510 --> 46:47.841
You're amazing.

46:48.179 --> 46:53.617
Having a luck dragon with you
is the only way to go on a quest.

46:53.984 --> 46:56.145
Things will work out fine.

46:57.688 --> 47:01.522
Never give up and good luck will find you.

47:04.195 --> 47:06.288
It's good to have a friend again.

47:09.867 --> 47:12.028
You have more than one.

47:13.871 --> 47:15.202
Look.

48:12.062 --> 48:14.155
Get out of my light, wench.

48:14.265 --> 48:16.699
You're disturbing my scientific work.

48:16.767 --> 48:19.429
You and your scientific work.

48:19.937 --> 48:23.600
What the boy needs now
is one of my potions.

48:24.074 --> 48:28.067
The boy will need
my scientific advice much more.

48:29.613 --> 48:31.274
But not until he's well.

48:31.448 --> 48:34.747
Get back to your own corner, Engy.

48:34.985 --> 48:37.545
I'm always finding you in my place.

48:40.224 --> 48:42.055
He's well.

48:43.194 --> 48:44.821
Now it's my turn with him.

48:44.895 --> 48:46.658
No, you don't!

48:47.464 --> 48:51.127
I'll decide when he's well.
It's your turn when I say it is.

48:53.304 --> 48:55.636
Well, little man, still in pain?

48:56.106 --> 48:57.198
It's all right.

48:57.274 --> 49:01.608
I like that.
The patient telling the doctor it's all right.

49:02.079 --> 49:04.912
It has to hurt if it's to heal.

49:08.285 --> 49:09.411
Drink that.

49:11.589 --> 49:12.521
Good?

49:13.657 --> 49:15.488
That's my bat-wing broth.

49:16.560 --> 49:19.757
There's eye of newt in there,
tree mold, old lizard brains...

49:19.830 --> 49:23.163
...scales from a rancid sea serpent.

49:23.500 --> 49:27.334
Just where did you
and your dragon come from?

49:27.671 --> 49:29.138
What are you on to?

49:29.373 --> 49:32.536
Anything of interest
to the scientific community?

49:32.610 --> 49:35.602
My name is Atreyu.
I came to find the Southern Oracle.

49:36.146 --> 49:37.477
Here we go again.

49:37.681 --> 49:40.445
You've come to the right place, my boy.

49:40.885 --> 49:43.877
I am somewhat of an expert
on the Southern Oracle.

49:44.021 --> 49:46.990
"It is my scientific specialty."

49:47.324 --> 49:49.451
It is my scientific specialty.

49:50.027 --> 49:54.760
Why don't you sit down
and be quiet for once?

49:54.865 --> 49:56.799
You keep quiet, wench.

49:57.201 --> 49:58.429
It's my turn.

50:01.572 --> 50:05.804
My name is Engywook.
She's Urgl. Ever heard of me?

50:06.143 --> 50:07.508
I don't think so.

50:08.145 --> 50:10.636
You don't move in scientific circles.

50:11.115 --> 50:13.879
I am the expert on the Southern Oracle.

50:14.618 --> 50:16.813
You've come to the right place.

50:16.887 --> 50:19.048
There's no fool like an old fool.

50:19.223 --> 50:21.555
Wait! Stay here.

50:22.493 --> 50:25.656
The observatory. To the winch, wench.

50:31.101 --> 50:34.502
Come on, lazybones!
Can't you go any faster?

50:37.374 --> 50:40.707
I've been studying
the Southern Oracle for years.

50:40.911 --> 50:42.902
Some day I'll publish my book:

50:43.113 --> 50:46.776
<i>A Century of Studying the Southern Oracle</i>,
by Professor Engywook.

50:47.151 --> 50:49.142
<i>Volume I: The Early Years.</i>

50:51.255 --> 50:53.450
Have you ever been
to the Southern Oracle?

50:54.124 --> 50:55.523
What do you think?

50:55.592 --> 50:57.753
I work scientifically.

51:20.718 --> 51:21.707
Look.

51:30.427 --> 51:32.258
Is that the Southern Oracle?

51:32.830 --> 51:36.425
No. It's the first of the two gates
you must pass through...

51:36.700 --> 51:39.191
...before you reach the Southern Oracle...

51:39.303 --> 51:42.397
...and get me the final information
for my book.

51:44.141 --> 51:46.974
Of course, most people...

51:47.978 --> 51:49.969
...never get that far.

51:51.482 --> 51:52.471
Why?

51:53.017 --> 51:54.348
The Sphinxes' eyes...

51:54.418 --> 51:59.014
...stay closed until someone
who does not feel his own worth...

51:59.423 --> 52:00.913
...tries to pass by.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.992
Here comes one that looks fancy.

52:18.609 --> 52:21.942
Let's see what he really thinks of himself.

52:29.453 --> 52:31.717
Go on, scaredy-cat!

52:35.325 --> 52:39.091
It's my turn. Let me see. I'm the scientist.

52:39.263 --> 52:40.855
He's going on.

52:42.199 --> 52:43.791
I think he'll make it.

52:43.967 --> 52:48.927
The Sphinxes' eyes, are they open or shut?
Let me see.

52:49.740 --> 52:51.071
They're shut.

52:54.978 --> 52:56.468
The eyes are opening!

53:12.062 --> 53:14.496
Did he make it? Did he?

53:21.238 --> 53:23.570
Fancy armor doesn't help.

53:24.274 --> 53:28.574
The Sphinxes can see
straight into your heart.

53:32.683 --> 53:33.672
Listen.

53:33.884 --> 53:37.251
Next time let me see what happens.
It's my telescope.

53:42.059 --> 53:43.321
I'm going to try.

53:44.428 --> 53:47.727
Don't go yet.
I haven't told you about the next gate.

53:47.798 --> 53:49.925
It's even worse than this one.

54:29.940 --> 54:33.307
He'll never make it.

56:06.370 --> 56:10.101
Don't start to doubt yourself. Be confident.

56:15.612 --> 56:17.944
Be confident.

56:25.455 --> 56:26.649
Run, Atreyu!

56:27.591 --> 56:28.922
Run, Atreyu!

56:33.063 --> 56:34.030
Run! Now!

56:48.445 --> 56:49.742
He made it.

56:49.980 --> 56:51.311
He made it.

56:58.622 --> 57:01.614
He made it!

57:05.962 --> 57:08.863
You could use a dose of juicy vitamins, too.

57:08.932 --> 57:13.767
He made it!
Atreyu made it through the Sphinx gate.

57:14.404 --> 57:17.134
- I always said he could do it.
- Good.

57:19.076 --> 57:22.637
But that's no reason
to fall out of the basket again.

57:23.347 --> 57:25.338
I knew he'd be safe.

57:25.816 --> 57:29.343
Nonsense. You don't understand anything.

57:30.420 --> 57:35.255
The worst one is coming up.
Next is the Magic Mirror Gate.

57:36.093 --> 57:39.085
Atreyu must face his true self.

57:39.162 --> 57:43.258
So what? That won't be too hard for him.

57:43.333 --> 57:45.824
That's what everyone thinks.

57:46.336 --> 57:49.499
But kind people find that they are cruel.

57:50.107 --> 57:53.873
Brave men discover
they are really cowards.

57:54.444 --> 57:56.912
Confronted with their true selves...

57:56.980 --> 58:00.472
...most men run away screaming.

59:57.133 --> 59:59.465
Now, this is going too far.

01:00:18.922 --> 01:00:20.412
What if they...

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:24.023
...really do know about me in Fantasia?

01:01:12.909 --> 01:01:14.900
The Southern Oracle?

01:01:34.431 --> 01:01:36.365
<i>Do not be afraid.</i>

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.361
<i>We will not harm you.</i>

01:01:41.504 --> 01:01:45.998
<i>We have been waiting for you a long time.</i>

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.411
Are you the Southern Oracle?

01:01:52.882 --> 01:01:55.510
<i>Yes, we are.</i>

01:01:55.986 --> 01:01:58.648
Then you must know
what can save Fantasia.

01:01:59.055 --> 01:02:01.615
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

01:02:02.959 --> 01:02:05.951
Well, what is it? I have to know!

01:02:06.429 --> 01:02:07.760
<i>The Empress...</i>

01:02:09.165 --> 01:02:10.598
<i>... needs...</i>

01:02:11.201 --> 01:02:13.032
<i>... a new name.</i>

01:02:14.971 --> 01:02:18.600
A new name? That's all?

01:02:19.209 --> 01:02:20.369
But that's easy.

01:02:21.911 --> 01:02:24.175
I can give her any name she wants.

01:02:24.614 --> 01:02:27.242
<i>No one from Fantasia...</i>

01:02:28.218 --> 01:02:29.879
<i>... can do it.</i>

01:02:30.286 --> 01:02:32.948
<i>Only a human child...</i>

01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:36.622
<i>... can give her this new name.</i>

01:02:42.332 --> 01:02:45.165
A human child? Where can I find one?

01:02:45.669 --> 01:02:48.001
<i>You can only find one...</i>

01:02:49.506 --> 01:02:53.169
<i>... beyond the boundaries of Fantasia.</i>

01:02:59.215 --> 01:03:02.048
<i>If you want to save our world...</i>

01:03:02.886 --> 01:03:04.683
<i>... you must hurry.</i>

01:03:07.791 --> 01:03:09.452
<i>We don't know...</i>

01:03:09.626 --> 01:03:13.460
<i>... how much longer</i>
<i>we can withstand the Nothing.</i>

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.165
Falkor!

01:03:39.522 --> 01:03:42.184
Hurry, Falkor! The Nothing's everywhere.

01:03:42.292 --> 01:03:44.089
Don't worry.

01:03:44.928 --> 01:03:48.091
We'll reach the boundaries of Fantasia.

01:03:48.198 --> 01:03:52.032
- Do you know where they are?
- I have no idea.

01:03:52.969 --> 01:03:55.301
Then how do we find a human child?

01:03:55.638 --> 01:03:57.299
With luck.

01:03:58.808 --> 01:04:01.800
Faster, Falkor! We have to hurry.

01:04:02.011 --> 01:04:04.844
All right, hang on tight.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.982
What a shame they don't ask me.

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:22.321
My mother...

01:05:23.092 --> 01:05:25.754
...she had such a wonderful name.

01:05:41.244 --> 01:05:45.908
"On and on they flew
until they reached the Sea of Possibilities...

01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:48.317
"...where they could go no further."

01:05:50.653 --> 01:05:52.985
Look, Atreyu. The Nothing.

01:06:53.316 --> 01:06:54.647
Atreyu.

01:07:23.579 --> 01:07:25.240
Falkor!

01:07:29.485 --> 01:07:31.646
Where are you?

01:07:53.376 --> 01:07:56.573
Atreyu! Where are you?

01:08:48.296 --> 01:08:51.198
They look like big...

01:08:51.466 --> 01:08:55.596
...good, strong hands, don't they?

01:08:57.273 --> 01:09:01.265
I always thought that's what they were.

01:09:05.814 --> 01:09:08.283
My little friends.

01:09:08.718 --> 01:09:11.380
The little man with his racing snail...

01:09:11.687 --> 01:09:13.279
...the Night Hob...

01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:16.618
...even the stupid bat.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.393
I couldn't hold on to them.

01:09:21.697 --> 01:09:23.028
The Nothing...

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.633
...pulled them right out of my hands.

01:09:29.205 --> 01:09:30.866
I failed.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:34.332
No, you didn't fail. I'm the one who failed.

01:09:34.777 --> 01:09:37.609
I was the one chosen to stop the Nothing.

01:09:39.282 --> 01:09:41.113
But I lost the Auryn.

01:09:41.617 --> 01:09:43.778
I can't find my luck dragon.

01:09:44.087 --> 01:09:47.578
So I won't be able to get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

01:09:56.132 --> 01:09:57.463
Listen.

01:09:58.034 --> 01:09:59.524
The Nothing...

01:10:00.002 --> 01:10:01.902
...will be here any minute.

01:10:02.538 --> 01:10:05.029
I will just sit here...

01:10:05.741 --> 01:10:08.232
...and let it take me away, too.

01:10:09.846 --> 01:10:11.507
They look...

01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:14.212
...like good...

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:16.481
...strong...

01:10:16.686 --> 01:10:19.883
...hands, don't they?

01:11:22.552 --> 01:11:23.541
Morla?

01:11:26.989 --> 01:11:28.479
Artax!

01:12:19.775 --> 01:12:21.766
If you come any closer...

01:12:22.979 --> 01:12:25.812
...I will rip you to shreds.

01:12:32.555 --> 01:12:34.022
Who are you?

01:12:34.123 --> 01:12:36.455
I am Gmork.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.323
And you, whoever you are...

01:12:41.998 --> 01:12:45.729
...can have the honor
of being my last victim.

01:12:49.505 --> 01:12:51.200
I will not die easily.

01:12:51.941 --> 01:12:53.602
I am a warrior.

01:12:55.044 --> 01:12:57.035
Brave warrior.

01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.411
Then fight the Nothing.

01:12:59.482 --> 01:13:03.384
I can't. I can't get beyond
the boundaries of Fantasia.

01:13:06.055 --> 01:13:07.522
What's so funny?

01:13:07.623 --> 01:13:11.457
Fantasia has no boundaries.

01:13:17.767 --> 01:13:19.132
That's not true.

01:13:19.435 --> 01:13:22.097
- You're lying.
- Foolish boy.

01:13:23.906 --> 01:13:27.000
Don't you know anything about Fantasia?

01:13:27.877 --> 01:13:30.869
It's the world of human fantasy.

01:13:33.382 --> 01:13:35.043
Every part...

01:13:35.851 --> 01:13:37.443
...every creature...

01:13:38.187 --> 01:13:42.521
...is a piece of the dreams
and hopes of mankind.

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.521
Therefore...

01:13:47.363 --> 01:13:50.332
...it has no boundaries.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:00.131
Why is Fantasia dying then?

01:14:00.376 --> 01:14:04.210
Because people have begun
to lose their hopes...

01:14:05.481 --> 01:14:08.143
...and forget their dreams.

01:14:09.318 --> 01:14:12.151
So the Nothing grows stronger.

01:14:12.655 --> 01:14:14.145
What is the Nothing?

01:14:14.423 --> 01:14:17.085
It's the emptiness that's left.

01:14:18.494 --> 01:14:20.655
It is like a despair...

01:14:21.163 --> 01:14:23.324
...destroying this world.

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:27.194
And I have been trying to help it.

01:14:29.138 --> 01:14:30.230
But why?

01:14:30.606 --> 01:14:33.598
Because people who have no hopes...

01:14:34.343 --> 01:14:36.607
...are easy to control.

01:14:38.013 --> 01:14:40.675
And whoever has the control...

01:14:42.118 --> 01:14:44.450
...has the power.

01:14:59.235 --> 01:15:01.135
Who are you, really?

01:15:01.704 --> 01:15:03.695
I am the servant...

01:15:05.274 --> 01:15:08.107
...of the power behind the Nothing.

01:15:09.345 --> 01:15:12.678
I was sent to kill the only one...

01:15:13.315 --> 01:15:15.647
...who could have stopped the Nothing.

01:15:16.285 --> 01:15:19.618
I lost him in the Swamps of Sadness.

01:15:20.256 --> 01:15:21.587
His name...

01:15:22.892 --> 01:15:24.223
...was Atreyu.

01:15:28.764 --> 01:15:32.928
If we're about to die anyway,
I'd rather die fighting.

01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:37.196
Come for me, Gmork. I am Atreyu!

01:17:09.532 --> 01:17:11.022
Falkor!

01:17:20.376 --> 01:17:22.037
Atreyu!

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:47.733
<i>"That was the end of Fantasia.</i>

01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:51.405
<i>"Only a few fragments of this once...</i>

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:55.838
<i>"...rich and beautiful world</i>
<i>had been left by the Nothing. "</i>

01:18:06.322 --> 01:18:08.153
Good old Falkor.

01:18:08.691 --> 01:18:13.060
- Can you see anything? Anything at all?
- No.

01:18:14.363 --> 01:18:16.854
All the land is gone.

01:18:18.033 --> 01:18:21.366
I know. And all because I failed.

01:18:22.571 --> 01:18:24.129
You tried.

01:18:24.573 --> 01:18:27.064
Could the Ivory Tower still be standing?

01:18:27.476 --> 01:18:31.708
Let's hope so, Atreyu. Let's hope so.

01:18:36.552 --> 01:18:38.543
Let the Auryn guide you.

01:18:40.289 --> 01:18:44.282
If the Ivory Tower still stands,
take us there.

01:19:04.113 --> 01:19:05.774
The Ivory Tower!

01:20:09.044 --> 01:20:10.534
The Empress.

01:20:35.771 --> 01:20:37.102
Go on.

01:21:19.047 --> 01:21:21.880
Why do you look so sad?

01:21:38.734 --> 01:21:40.531
I have failed you, Empress.

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.400
You haven't.

01:21:48.143 --> 01:21:49.770
You brought him with you.

01:21:51.814 --> 01:21:52.803
Who?

01:21:53.448 --> 01:21:55.678
The earthling child.

01:21:56.418 --> 01:21:58.010
The one...

01:21:58.086 --> 01:22:00.247
...who can save us all.

01:22:00.989 --> 01:22:03.150
You knew about the earthling child?

01:22:04.226 --> 01:22:08.060
Of course. I knew everything.

01:22:09.631 --> 01:22:12.998
My horse died, I nearly drowned.

01:22:13.268 --> 01:22:15.668
I just barely got away from the Nothing.

01:22:15.804 --> 01:22:18.602
For what? To find out
what you already knew?

01:22:18.674 --> 01:22:22.007
It was the only way
to get in touch with an earthling.

01:22:22.277 --> 01:22:24.541
But I didn't get in touch with an earthling!

01:22:26.315 --> 01:22:27.976
Yes, you did.

01:22:29.251 --> 01:22:30.684
He has suffered with you.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:34.912
<i>He went through everything</i>
<i>you went through.</i>

01:22:36.158 --> 01:22:38.991
<i>And now, he has come here...</i>

01:22:40.028 --> 01:22:41.086
<i>... with you.</i>

01:22:42.264 --> 01:22:45.427
He is very close, listening...

01:22:46.568 --> 01:22:50.698
...to every word we say.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.229
What?

01:23:07.389 --> 01:23:11.120
Where is he?
If he's so close, why doesn't he arrive?

01:23:16.465 --> 01:23:21.300
He doesn't realize
he's already part of <i>The Neverending Story</i>.

01:23:23.772 --> 01:23:25.569
<i>The Neverending Story</i> ?

01:23:25.641 --> 01:23:27.233
What's that?

01:23:27.309 --> 01:23:30.767
Just as he is sharing all your adventures...

01:23:30.879 --> 01:23:33.370
...others are sharing his.

01:23:33.916 --> 01:23:35.178
They were with him...

01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:38.383
<i>... when he hid from the boys</i>
<i>in the bookstore.</i>

01:23:40.989 --> 01:23:42.684
But that's impossible!

01:23:42.925 --> 01:23:45.416
They were with him
when he took the book...

01:23:45.594 --> 01:23:47.653
...with the Auryn symbol on the cover...

01:23:48.797 --> 01:23:52.096
<i>... in which he's reading his own story...</i>

01:23:52.968 --> 01:23:54.458
...right now.

01:23:59.975 --> 01:24:01.966
I can't believe it.

01:24:03.445 --> 01:24:05.777
They can't be talking about me.

01:24:09.051 --> 01:24:11.076
What if he doesn't appear?

01:24:11.153 --> 01:24:13.553
Then our world will disappear.

01:24:14.556 --> 01:24:16.217
And so will I.

01:24:19.528 --> 01:24:21.325
How could he let that happen?

01:24:21.396 --> 01:24:26.197
He doesn't understand that he's the one
with the power to stop it.

01:24:26.268 --> 01:24:28.702
He simply can't imagine...

01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:31.637
...that one little boy
could be that important.

01:24:34.443 --> 01:24:35.910
Is it really me?

01:24:36.878 --> 01:24:38.505
Maybe he doesn't know what to do.

01:24:38.947 --> 01:24:40.414
What do I have to do?

01:24:41.183 --> 01:24:44.175
He has to give me a new name.

01:24:44.519 --> 01:24:46.680
He's already chosen it.

01:24:47.789 --> 01:24:49.780
He just has to call it out.

01:24:53.628 --> 01:24:56.153
But it's only a story. It's not real.

01:24:56.264 --> 01:24:57.356
It's only a story.

01:24:58.867 --> 01:25:00.858
Atreyu, no!

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.221
Bastian!

01:25:29.297 --> 01:25:32.960
Why don't you do
what you dream, Bastian?

01:25:33.301 --> 01:25:36.737
But I can't.
I must keep my feet on the ground.

01:25:37.039 --> 01:25:38.700
Call my name.

01:25:41.309 --> 01:25:44.301
Bastian, please!

01:25:46.314 --> 01:25:47.645
Save us!

01:25:47.716 --> 01:25:49.809
<i>All right! I'll do it!</i>

01:25:50.085 --> 01:25:53.782
I'll save you. I will do what I dream.

01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:20.971
<i>Why is it so dark?</i>

01:26:21.850 --> 01:26:25.684
<i>In the beginning, it is always dark.</i>

01:26:30.692 --> 01:26:32.182
What is that?

01:26:32.761 --> 01:26:34.922
One grain of sand.

01:26:35.564 --> 01:26:39.227
It is all that remains of my vast empire.

01:26:47.075 --> 01:26:49.839
Fantasia has totally disappeared?

01:26:51.346 --> 01:26:52.836
Yes.

01:26:55.717 --> 01:26:58.208
Then everything's been in vain.

01:26:59.054 --> 01:27:01.215
No, it hasn't.

01:27:02.557 --> 01:27:05.185
Fantasia can arise anew...

01:27:06.761 --> 01:27:09.423
...from your dreams and wishes.

01:27:11.233 --> 01:27:12.393
How?

01:27:13.168 --> 01:27:14.999
Open your hand.

01:27:29.918 --> 01:27:32.079
What are you going to wish for?

01:27:34.322 --> 01:27:35.619
I don't know.

01:27:37.459 --> 01:27:41.293
Then there will be no Fantasia anymore.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.529
How many wishes do I get?

01:27:49.137 --> 01:27:51.128
As many as you want.

01:27:51.973 --> 01:27:54.464
And the more wishes you make...

01:27:54.976 --> 01:27:58.605
...the more magnificent
Fantasia will become.

01:27:58.914 --> 01:28:00.074
Really?

01:28:01.016 --> 01:28:02.506
Try it.

01:28:15.730 --> 01:28:17.527
Then my first wish is...

01:28:26.775 --> 01:28:29.710
Falkor, it's even more beautiful
than I thought!

01:28:40.755 --> 01:28:44.247
- Like it?
- Falkor, it's wonderful.

01:28:49.231 --> 01:28:52.894
Falkor, it's like the Nothing never was.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.881
Atreyu and Artax!

01:29:27.502 --> 01:29:30.494
What would you like to wish for next?

01:30:00.402 --> 01:30:02.393
Look, there they are.

01:30:03.905 --> 01:30:05.395
It's a monster!

01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:10.375
Get them, Falkor!
Let's see how you like it, chickens.

01:30:10.679 --> 01:30:12.010
Down here.

01:30:26.628 --> 01:30:29.062
We're going to get you!

01:30:54.956 --> 01:30:57.117
<i>Bastian made many other wishes...</i>

01:30:57.759 --> 01:31:00.421
<i>... and had many other</i>
<i>amazing adventures...</i>

01:31:01.529 --> 01:31:04.521
<i>... before he finally returned</i>
<i>to the ordinary world.</i>

01:31:05.667 --> 01:31:08.192
<i>But that's another story.</i>
