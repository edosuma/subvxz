00:01.290 --> 00:03.690
Do not try what you're about to see at home.

00:03.860 --> 00:06.200
We're what you call experts.

00:07.710 --> 00:11.160
On this car-crazy episode of Mythbusters:

00:11.170 --> 00:13.000
The obscenity begins!

00:13.120 --> 00:15.890
Adam and Jamie think outside the box...

00:15.890 --> 00:17.060
Well, there's your problem.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.820
as they literally reinvent the wheel

00:19.820 --> 00:22.610
Our lives have officially become a cartoon.

00:22.610 --> 00:24.670
Testing the myth that square wheels

00:24.670 --> 00:26.070
will give you a smooth ride...

00:26.980 --> 00:29.640
provided you drive fast enough.

00:32.060 --> 00:34.450
Meanwhile, Kari, Tory, and Grant

00:34.540 --> 00:37.000
tackle a "Date Night" movie myth.

00:37.380 --> 00:39.230
Well, there's something you don't see every day.

00:39.230 --> 00:41.780
Can two cars stuck bumper to bumper...

00:41.780 --> 00:42.660
Let's do it.

00:42.660 --> 00:44.180
drive city streets...

00:44.180 --> 00:45.970
- I've got no steering! - Brakes! Brakes!

00:45.970 --> 00:47.990
cut corners...

00:48.270 --> 00:49.940
Can you believe we're getting paid to do this?

00:49.940 --> 00:51.980
and even do a 180 spin?

00:53.520 --> 00:54.520
So, yeah,

00:54.520 --> 00:56.960
that was pretty much the best date I've ever been on.

00:59.510 --> 01:01.630
Who are the mythbusters?

01:02.430 --> 01:03.240
Adam Savage...

01:05.940 --> 01:07.240
and Jamie Hyneman.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.910
Things are gonna start to get a little crazy in here.

01:09.910 --> 01:14.110
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.

01:14.120 --> 01:15.880
Together with Grant Imahara...

01:16.870 --> 01:18.030
Kari Byron...

01:18.350 --> 01:19.570
Hi, Grant!

01:19.570 --> 01:20.970
and Tory Belleci.

01:20.970 --> 01:21.680
Hit it!

01:22.040 --> 01:24.080
They don't just tell the myths,

01:24.440 --> 01:26.790
they put them to the test.

01:40.220 --> 01:42.230
Hey. What, uh -- whatcha doing?

01:42.230 --> 01:43.370
Daydreaming.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.950
What does a Hyneman daydream about?

01:46.410 --> 01:47.640
Square wheels.

01:48.390 --> 01:51.360
Like, what if you put square wheels on a truck?

01:51.590 --> 01:55.890
I would imagine it would give you the roughest possible ride.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.930
it would eventually smooth out, wouldn't it?

02:03.940 --> 02:08.120
You're wondering how fast you have to drive with square wheels

02:08.120 --> 02:10.229
in order to get a smooth ride?

02:10.229 --> 02:12.520
- Yeah. - That's great.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.370
I think we should put it to the test.

02:15.340 --> 02:17.740
It may have come from the Hyneman's mind,

02:17.740 --> 02:20.800
but it's also going gangbusters on the fan site.

02:21.830 --> 02:24.870
Because according to the myth, at a fast-enough speed,

02:24.870 --> 02:28.710
the difference between square and round wheels would disappear.

02:28.710 --> 02:30.540
But can this really be true?

02:30.540 --> 02:34.120
Or is this a myth that's headed back to square one?

02:34.270 --> 02:37.020
So, what's your plan for these square wheels?

02:37.020 --> 02:39.290
Well, pretty much everything that we need for this

02:39.290 --> 02:40.990
is gonna be really abused.

02:40.990 --> 02:43.090
So the wheels we're gonna have to design

02:43.090 --> 02:45.050
to be able to take all of the stress.

02:45.050 --> 02:46.960
The truck's gonna have to be really heavy-duty.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.490
It's gonna have to be four-wheel drive,

02:48.490 --> 02:50.560
and have a big torque engine in it.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.440
Super-beefy wheels, super-beefy truck.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.100
I think we should also add in there

02:54.100 --> 02:55.770
some nice, objective way

02:55.770 --> 02:58.210
of measuring the smoothness of the ride we get.

02:58.210 --> 03:00.510
Like, we compare it to a round-wheel drive,

03:00.510 --> 03:02.070
and see how close we can get.

03:02.070 --> 03:03.150
Instrumentation.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.080
Precisely.

03:05.510 --> 03:08.030
What I'm trying to figure out here is that

03:08.030 --> 03:10.390
if we took a wheel like this,

03:10.460 --> 03:14.230
and changed it into something shaped more like this, a square,

03:14.230 --> 03:16.190
how fast would we have to go

03:16.190 --> 03:19.420
to stay on the corners, like so,

03:20.790 --> 03:23.780
and actually end up with a smooth ride?

03:23.780 --> 03:25.470
Whether that's possible or not,

03:25.470 --> 03:27.310
at what speed that occurs --

03:27.770 --> 03:29.210
that's what we're trying to find out.

03:29.350 --> 03:31.490
And first up comes the brainstorm --

03:31.500 --> 03:34.480
how to design a square wheel in the first place.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.360
How is this square wheel gonna look?

03:36.530 --> 03:37.800
It's gonna be square.

03:37.850 --> 03:38.960
All right.

03:39.060 --> 03:41.560
Reinventing the wheel is no easy feat.

03:41.650 --> 03:43.420
Obviously we're gonna go with steel for this.

03:43.420 --> 03:44.510
What about something like,

03:44.510 --> 03:46.360
you know, a straight box?

03:46.360 --> 03:49.070
Well, I think that's a decent place to start.

03:49.070 --> 03:50.980
Every single wheel rotation...

03:50.980 --> 03:53.690
And then we spider out with some gussets.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.120
could lead to a catastrophic collapse...

03:56.120 --> 03:57.640
That'll start to look pretty sexy.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.920
because of the 5,000-pound truck that they'll be carrying.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.890
This is really, really bizarre.

04:04.610 --> 04:07.000
But by thinking inside the square,

04:07.000 --> 04:09.060
their idea gets into gear.

04:09.060 --> 04:09.620
Cool.

04:09.620 --> 04:11.400
Well, let's get to it.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.580
The final four-sided design

04:13.580 --> 04:16.500
has reinforcements at the center and corners,

04:16.500 --> 04:18.290
making it incredibly strong,

04:18.290 --> 04:20.620
but also, incredibly complex.

04:20.620 --> 04:23.380
And with so many individual pieces of steel,

04:23.380 --> 04:25.370
it'll need to be laser-cut.

04:25.380 --> 04:27.450
And thanks to the wonders of television...

04:27.450 --> 04:28.410
Our parts are here?

04:28.410 --> 04:29.400
They're here.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.600
Dude.

04:30.620 --> 04:32.420
That takes no time at all.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.060
That is gorgeous!

04:34.060 --> 04:36.420
Man, those are so pretty.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.310
- Let's set one up. - Okay.

04:40.510 --> 04:42.970
In order to keep our square wheels from each wing,

04:42.970 --> 04:44.310
like, 200 pounds a piece,

04:44.310 --> 04:47.070
we designed it all out of 3/16-inch steel.

04:47.070 --> 04:48.660
Now, that may not seem like much,

04:48.660 --> 04:50.270
but the design and the gussets

04:50.270 --> 04:52.450
and the distribution of the forces

04:52.450 --> 04:53.960
really ought to be able to take this.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.340
But with steel this thin,

04:55.340 --> 04:57.670
you can't just lay in these big, fat welding beads.

04:57.670 --> 04:59.230
You actually have to stitch it carefully,

04:59.230 --> 05:00.750
because the stuff, if it gets too hot,

05:00.750 --> 05:02.940
can warp, and that's bad.

05:02.940 --> 05:04.120
It's a laborious process,

05:04.120 --> 05:05.670
but hopefully, it'll be worth it.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.210
And once the mythbusters get their heads down,

05:08.210 --> 05:11.780
their hubs are soon looking like the "wheel" deal.

05:11.780 --> 05:12.970
Nice!

05:12.970 --> 05:14.870
Want to grab a side? Let's put it on the ground.

05:14.870 --> 05:16.770
Yeah. This is how the tire goes on, right?

05:16.770 --> 05:17.890
Hopefully.

05:20.660 --> 05:22.690
That has a satisfying ring to it, doesn't it?

05:22.690 --> 05:24.480
It really does. It rings like a bell.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.410
It's so pretty.

05:25.410 --> 05:26.660
I'll be right back.

05:30.220 --> 05:33.500
It's a square wheel!

05:33.600 --> 05:35.710
Those two words shouldn't go together!

05:36.120 --> 05:37.060
They shouldn't,

05:37.060 --> 05:39.490
But this isn't quite up to shape yet...

05:40.820 --> 05:42.260
Well, there's your problem.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.880
because next, it's time for the rubber to meet the rim.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.270
When you started this job,

05:47.270 --> 05:49.790
did you ever imagine you'd be lubing a square tire

05:49.790 --> 05:52.820
to fit a large piece of rubber on it?

05:53.550 --> 05:55.450
That's been my lifelong dream.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.020
In theory, the guide bars

05:59.020 --> 06:01.350
should make levering on the tire easier.

06:01.540 --> 06:04.030
Go ahead and get a clamp on that.

06:04.270 --> 06:07.430
But trying to fit a square peg into a round hole

06:07.990 --> 06:10.670
is just as difficult as it sounds.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.890
My family's been fitting square wheels

06:13.890 --> 06:15.490
for two centuries now.

06:15.860 --> 06:17.420
No one's bought one, though.

06:18.270 --> 06:20.770
I want my square wheels!

06:22.150 --> 06:25.020
Even bringing in a 2,000-pound wrecking ball...

06:25.660 --> 06:27.620
This is like how the Egyptians do it.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.480
Behold, the Egyptian forklift.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.580
doesn't get the tire onto the square.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.340
So, Jamie has a solution.

06:33.790 --> 06:35.000
Slightly bigger.

06:35.930 --> 06:37.210
I hope it works.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.160
How's it look?

06:39.600 --> 06:40.490
Much better.

06:40.490 --> 06:42.040
Dude!

06:42.170 --> 06:44.360
I was able to just put it on by hand.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.310
That is a square wheel.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.910
That is, without a doubt, a square-frigging-wheel.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.570
Thanks to their ingenuity and hard work,

06:55.570 --> 06:57.950
the mythbusters have squared the circle.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.900
Doing that makes me nervous.

06:59.900 --> 07:03.300
Now, they just have to complete another three.

07:05.950 --> 07:08.750
Next up, a conjoined car caper.

07:11.050 --> 07:12.530
All right, so, we have another Hollywood myth,

07:12.530 --> 07:14.360
and this one comes from the movie "Date Night,"

07:14.360 --> 07:16.360
where two cars get into a head-on collision

07:16.360 --> 07:17.670
and become conjoined.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.930
Not only that, but they continue to drive around the city.

07:19.930 --> 07:20.840
I know this one.

07:20.840 --> 07:21.900
They actually get stuck together.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.890
They go forward, backward, go around corners.

07:23.890 --> 07:24.750
It's awesome.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.780
A little demolition, a little stunt driving.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.840
I love it.

07:28.050 --> 07:30.120
It's a date night with a difference.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.250
According to the movie, two cars crash together,

07:33.580 --> 07:37.320
then speed down city streets, cut corners,

07:38.480 --> 07:40.730
and even manage a 180 spin.

07:41.780 --> 07:44.930
But could two conjoined cars even move,

07:44.930 --> 07:48.130
let alone achieve these turbocharged tricks?

07:48.610 --> 07:49.760
All right, so we're gonna test

07:49.770 --> 07:51.090
whether these two conjoined cars

07:51.100 --> 07:53.020
can drive all these crazy maneuvers, right?

07:53.020 --> 07:54.580
But are we gonna test whether they can

07:54.580 --> 07:56.570
become joined that way in the first place?

07:56.570 --> 07:58.000
No, actually we don't have to test that.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.920
I was talking to these guys at the crash-test facility,

07:59.920 --> 08:02.160
and they were saying that this can happen.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.460
Cars can become connected in a collision.

08:04.460 --> 08:07.280
It's very rare, like, 1 in 100,000 chances.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.740
But it can happen.

08:08.740 --> 08:11.210
Which means that could take days and days to replicate,

08:11.220 --> 08:12.840
not to mention that's quite a chunk of change.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.590
Okay, so, we'll join the cars ourselves.

08:14.590 --> 08:16.050
And we'll do just like they did in the movie --

08:16.050 --> 08:18.930
nose-to-nose, and make sure that they never separate.

08:18.930 --> 08:19.960
Cool, because this myth really

08:19.960 --> 08:20.890
is about the maneuvers,

08:20.890 --> 08:22.650
and not whether they can get stuck together.

08:22.860 --> 08:24.770
And we've got to design something

08:24.770 --> 08:26.960
that can accelerate, brake, do slide turns,

08:26.960 --> 08:28.860
180s, and safely.

08:28.860 --> 08:30.600
Exactly. Now the real question is,

08:30.600 --> 08:32.270
how the heck are we gonna do this?

08:33.200 --> 08:35.260
Well, step one is to get two cars

08:35.270 --> 08:37.990
more or less identical to the ones in the movie.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.120
Here's what we've got.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.799
Over here we have our cab,

08:40.799 --> 08:43.000
which is a basic sedan, rear-wheel drive.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.700
And for our sports sedan,

08:44.700 --> 08:48.630
since we can't afford a $158,000 car just to wreck,

08:48.630 --> 08:50.870
we got one with equivalent technology.

08:50.870 --> 08:53.570
It's got equivalent horsepower, and it's all-wheel drive.

08:53.910 --> 08:54.940
And with that,

08:54.940 --> 08:57.870
step two is to turn them into a double act.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.630
What's that?

09:03.630 --> 09:04.930
It's got missiles!

09:05.080 --> 09:06.980
This is the coolest car ever!

09:07.270 --> 09:08.700
What the heck are these?

09:08.730 --> 09:11.140
But connecting two cars bumper-to-bumper

09:11.140 --> 09:12.840
was never going to be easy.

09:15.030 --> 09:16.980
All right, well, problem number one --

09:17.000 --> 09:18.840
this car has an all-aluminum frame,

09:18.840 --> 09:19.870
so there's no welding to it.

09:19.870 --> 09:21.170
That sucks.

09:21.340 --> 09:23.570
No welding means that the mythbusters

09:23.570 --> 09:25.680
will have to come up with a plan B.

09:26.170 --> 09:28.170
Now, initially we were gonna try and connect to the bumper,

09:28.180 --> 09:30.000
but that's not the strongest part of the car.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.260
The strongest part of the car is actually the frame.

09:32.260 --> 09:33.930
That's where the driver's cage is.

09:33.930 --> 09:35.880
That's the most rigid part of the car.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.080
So, we're gonna use that to connect frame-to-frame

09:39.080 --> 09:40.580
instead of bumper-to-bumper.

09:40.850 --> 09:42.530
Let's put these cars together.

09:43.530 --> 09:45.650
It's a heavy-duty solution...

09:45.850 --> 09:47.410
Oh, not using the light stuff.

09:47.730 --> 09:50.250
That'll ensure that their heavy-duty cars

09:50.250 --> 09:52.570
stay nose-to-nose on the track.

09:52.970 --> 09:55.460
Now, each of these cars weighs over 2 tons,

09:55.460 --> 09:56.800
and we'll have these stuck together

09:56.800 --> 09:58.690
driving over 40 miles an hour.

09:58.700 --> 10:02.250
So, we've designed a steel frame that will fuse to the taxi,

10:02.260 --> 10:04.660
and that will bolt to the sedan -- simple.

10:05.050 --> 10:06.930
And all that serious steel

10:06.940 --> 10:09.740
means they've got some serious welding to do.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.340
Glamorous.

10:12.460 --> 10:13.890
Very glamorous.

10:14.910 --> 10:17.130
The guys take a page from "Flashdance"

10:17.140 --> 10:18.710
as the sparks fly.

10:19.980 --> 10:23.070
And, slowly, the "Date Night" frame comes together.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.170
You cut the muffler off of any car,

10:36.170 --> 10:37.280
it sounds cooler.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.330
The cars have got serious muscle,

10:39.330 --> 10:41.530
but with the aluminum side bolted in,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.320
and the other side welded on,

10:45.320 --> 10:47.480
the frame should keep that in check.

10:48.140 --> 10:50.670
So, all we need to do is get our cars on the flatbed,

10:50.670 --> 10:52.820
and take it out to location and test this myth.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.490
That's all they have to do.

10:54.490 --> 10:57.210
But with the connected cars weighing in at 4 tons,

10:58.470 --> 11:01.010
I think we got a problem here with this forklift.

11:01.180 --> 11:03.370
that's not an easy proposition.

11:05.640 --> 11:06.930
What's that?

11:06.930 --> 11:08.100
It's making evil noises,

11:08.100 --> 11:09.910
and it's kind of doing like this.

11:11.820 --> 11:12.800
Who would have thought

11:12.800 --> 11:14.920
this would be the most difficult part of the day,

11:15.170 --> 11:17.050
just packing up the cars?

11:17.050 --> 11:18.930
We haven't even started the experiment.

11:19.610 --> 11:21.650
Well, there's something you don't see every day.

11:22.170 --> 11:24.440
Eventually the double-wide is loaded up,

11:24.450 --> 11:27.250
and ready for its turbocharged excursion.

11:28.110 --> 11:29.380
See you there.

11:30.720 --> 11:31.530
Later...

11:31.530 --> 11:32.980
I've got no steering!

11:32.980 --> 11:34.180
Will the "Date Night" driving

11:34.180 --> 11:35.840
be double or nothing?

11:37.050 --> 11:38.500
That's better than coffee.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.540
But first...

11:39.980 --> 11:41.470
In a few minutes,

11:41.540 --> 11:43.100
we're about to make another little piece

11:43.100 --> 11:44.430
of Mythbusters' history.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.530
For who else, I ask you,

11:46.540 --> 11:49.820
has attached square wheels to a car?

11:56.210 --> 11:59.230
Since Jamie was just a baby, a circular wheel

11:59.230 --> 12:02.020
has been the design of choice for a smooth ride.

12:02.730 --> 12:05.170
But could a square wheel at speed

12:05.170 --> 12:07.250
be just as comfortable?

12:07.290 --> 12:10.860
Well, after squaring up a feat of engineering excellence,

12:10.860 --> 12:13.980
the mythbusters are ready to roll on testing.

12:14.070 --> 12:15.240
Let's get out of here.

12:15.240 --> 12:17.720
And with a truck packing plenty of power,

12:17.730 --> 12:20.740
they hit the road for a familiar testing ground.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.830
I love this tarmac.

12:22.980 --> 12:24.640
Nice day for a bouncy ride, huh?

12:24.640 --> 12:26.580
Absolutely it is. Let's get started.

12:27.660 --> 12:29.970
If these babies have any chance at all

12:29.970 --> 12:30.920
of giving us a smooth ride,

12:30.920 --> 12:32.430
how are we gonna know

12:32.430 --> 12:33.660
beyond our own subjective experience?

12:33.660 --> 12:36.170
We need an objective measuring system

12:36.170 --> 12:38.530
for telling us how smooth our ride is.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.680
And that's where Jason and Scott come in.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.030
They work at LMS,

12:43.030 --> 12:44.700
a software and hardware engineering company

12:44.700 --> 12:46.750
that measures the vibration of all sorts of things,

12:46.760 --> 12:50.050
from cars to airplanes to washing machines.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.280
And they're going to measure our experiment.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.100
Jason and Scott

12:54.100 --> 12:57.280
position the sensitive sensors in three key areas...

12:57.280 --> 12:58.220
Good to go.

12:58.220 --> 13:00.740
to track the vibration on the suspension,

13:00.750 --> 13:04.020
the steering column, and, of course, the passengers.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.540
And with the test track set...

13:07.680 --> 13:09.020
That looks festive.

13:09.470 --> 13:12.860
they'll be put to use first in the round-wheel control.

13:13.310 --> 13:16.680
In 3, 2, 1. Go.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.370
Here we go.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.940
Feels like a pretty nice ride so far.

13:22.750 --> 13:23.630
As it should be.

13:27.430 --> 13:28.630
55.

13:28.630 --> 13:29.810
55.

13:30.140 --> 13:33.860
And...60.

13:33.860 --> 13:35.300
60 miles an hour.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.360
Feels pretty smooth.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.570
I'm thinking we got a good measurement.

13:38.570 --> 13:40.540
Bring it to a halt and head back to home base,

13:40.540 --> 13:42.510
throw some square wheels on this puppy.

13:43.010 --> 13:44.960
Unsurprisingly, the traditional wheels

13:44.960 --> 13:46.720
provide a comfortable ride,

13:46.740 --> 13:49.220
something's that's backed up by the sensors.

13:49.780 --> 13:50.780
Hey, guys.

13:50.780 --> 13:52.850
- We get anything good? - Absolutely.

13:52.850 --> 13:55.030
So, we see you went up to about 60 miles an hour.

13:55.030 --> 13:56.410
Steering column and the seat pad

13:56.410 --> 13:59.280
are nice low levels of vibration, as we'd expect.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.550
That looks like a really good baseline.

14:00.550 --> 14:02.100
We expect this to go way up

14:02.100 --> 14:03.460
with the square wheels, I'd say.

14:03.460 --> 14:04.730
So do we.

14:04.730 --> 14:05.580
All right, let's get it.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.680
With the baseline set,

14:06.680 --> 14:08.890
it's time for the weirdest wheel change

14:08.890 --> 14:10.710
in automobile history.

14:11.330 --> 14:12.570
This is so wrong.

14:13.550 --> 14:15.860
And yet it feels so right.

14:22.540 --> 14:24.560
The obscenity begins!

14:25.060 --> 14:26.160
You know, I don't think you'd need

14:26.160 --> 14:27.970
a parking break with these things.

14:28.190 --> 14:30.170
No need to curve your wheels on a hill.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.140
- No. - No.

14:32.630 --> 14:34.760
Personally, I don't think we're gonna get a smooth ride

14:34.760 --> 14:35.580
out of these square wheels.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.570
But more than that, with all of them flat,

14:37.570 --> 14:40.200
I seriously imagine that the first quarter turn,

14:40.210 --> 14:41.410
the first turn the truck...

14:41.520 --> 14:46.240
boom...and lands on that second part of the square.

14:46.650 --> 14:48.520
The truck may look at that as an accident

14:48.520 --> 14:49.410
and just shut down.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.470
We might not even get

14:50.470 --> 14:52.810
more than one quarter turn on this test.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.990
Well, as the mythbusters' mantra goes,

14:54.990 --> 14:56.900
"There's only one way to find out."

14:57.130 --> 15:00.960
But that's a way that first involves a suit-up for safety...

15:01.810 --> 15:04.540
because with the world's first set of square wheels

15:04.540 --> 15:05.760
doing the spinning,

15:05.760 --> 15:07.980
the mythbusters are taking no chances.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.130
Let's do it!

15:09.140 --> 15:10.440
- I'm ready. - All right. Here we go.

15:10.440 --> 15:11.580
The moment of truth.

15:11.740 --> 15:13.780
Square wheels, smooth ride,

15:13.810 --> 15:15.370
all four wheels flat.

15:15.370 --> 15:18.730
In 3, 2, 1. Go!

15:20.810 --> 15:22.630
They're off to a bumpy start.

15:25.110 --> 15:26.600
That smoothed right out!

15:26.620 --> 15:30.440
But as Jamie accelerates, the ride seems to get smoother...

15:30.440 --> 15:31.530
Dude!

15:31.760 --> 15:32.710
I think -- whoa!

15:35.030 --> 15:37.870
At least until it suddenly stops altogether.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.900
Something's dreadfully wrong.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.680
Yeah, we're sitting sideways.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.060
We're sitting sideways, and we're not level.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.080
I know.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.750
Aw, crap, Jamie.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.000
It's bad.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.570
There's your problem!

15:59.990 --> 16:00.840
What happened?

16:00.840 --> 16:03.560
We sheared everything out of that wheel hub.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.270
- All the bolts? - All of them.

16:05.270 --> 16:07.390
Well, at least it didn't ruin the wheels.

16:07.390 --> 16:09.040
I know. Exactly.

16:10.110 --> 16:13.730
The term of art for that is "One hell of a ride."

16:16.330 --> 16:17.840
That smoothed right out!

16:17.840 --> 16:19.940
For about five seconds there,

16:19.940 --> 16:21.600
it felt like we were actually getting

16:21.600 --> 16:23.090
something approaching a smooth ride.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.610
And then everything fell apart.

16:28.860 --> 16:30.050
The fact is,

16:30.050 --> 16:31.580
this is one of the most powerful trucks

16:31.580 --> 16:32.920
we could get our hands on.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.740
And driving with all four wheels flat --

16:34.740 --> 16:36.540
just too much for it.

16:36.540 --> 16:38.770
But even in that 15-second window,

16:38.770 --> 16:40.760
the wheels did get up enough speed

16:40.760 --> 16:42.690
to spin corner-to-corner.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.810
However, do the sensors confirm that it was smooth?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.880
All right, Scott. What do you got for us?

16:48.920 --> 16:51.600
Well, you can definitely see some trends here.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.600
As the speed goes up,

16:52.600 --> 16:54.190
the vertical acceleration in the suspension

16:54.190 --> 16:55.630
is definitely going down.

16:55.640 --> 16:56.620
If I go to the steering column,

16:56.620 --> 16:57.600
you'll see the same trend.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.770
As the speed goes up,

16:58.910 --> 17:01.030
vibrational energy definitely goes down.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.190
Well, the data is pretty compelling,

17:03.190 --> 17:04.280
and it actually seems to match

17:04.280 --> 17:05.740
what Jamie and I felt in the truck,

17:05.740 --> 17:08.470
which is that before it destroyed itself,

17:08.680 --> 17:10.420
we actually felt the ride smoothing out.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.359
There might just be something to this,

17:12.369 --> 17:14.160
so we're gonna keep on testing it.

17:14.290 --> 17:15.260
Absolutely,

17:15.260 --> 17:17.859
because it ain't over until the square wheels spin

17:17.859 --> 17:19.660
and don't fall off the truck.

17:24.339 --> 17:25.520
Coming right up...

17:25.520 --> 17:27.319
Hey, what are you doing? Get out of my way!

17:27.319 --> 17:29.930
The conjoined car caper goes straight.

17:29.930 --> 17:32.590
Ohh, no!

17:37.250 --> 17:39.600
The mythbusters have got double the trouble

17:39.600 --> 17:42.090
with a "Date Night" double-driving myth.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.720
And after some ingenious automotive surgery...

17:47.750 --> 17:49.140
Look, ma, no hands!

17:49.140 --> 17:51.450
The conjoined cars are at Alameda

17:51.460 --> 17:53.650
ready for the maneuvering mayhem.

17:54.090 --> 17:56.390
So, we're testing a myth in the movie "Date Night,"

17:56.390 --> 17:58.160
where two cars get in a head-on collision,

17:58.160 --> 17:59.960
and they become linked together.

17:59.970 --> 18:01.490
During this whole three-minute sequence,

18:01.490 --> 18:03.790
they drive around and around, back and forth.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.720
We're gonna start with the straight line test,

18:05.720 --> 18:06.730
because potentially,

18:06.730 --> 18:09.640
that is the safest and the easiest on the cars.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.270
That's right.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.440
They're breaking the scene into its elements --

18:12.440 --> 18:15.390
the straight line test, the 90-degree turn,

18:15.410 --> 18:16.780
and the 180 spin.

18:16.780 --> 18:19.520
And first up, they're going straight.

18:19.570 --> 18:22.040
With the cab in neutral, can the sports sedan

18:22.040 --> 18:24.580
really shove it backwards at 40 miles an hour

18:24.580 --> 18:26.110
from a standing start?

18:28.420 --> 18:31.990
Well, once the cab gets its obligatory mythbusters makeover...

18:31.990 --> 18:33.550
Now, that's a taxi.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.790
It's time to find out.

18:34.790 --> 18:35.840
Let's go.

18:36.010 --> 18:37.490
It's our sports sedan.

18:37.490 --> 18:39.660
It's fast, and it's got a lot of torque.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.350
But you know what?

18:40.350 --> 18:43.000
It's designed for a specific load.

18:43.010 --> 18:45.940
And by connecting our taxi cab to this car...

18:45.940 --> 18:48.240
Hey, what are you doing? Get out of my way!

18:48.770 --> 18:50.520
Essentially, we're doubling that load,

18:50.530 --> 18:52.180
and making it even harder.

18:52.180 --> 18:54.720
And that means that all the torque that this car has,

18:54.730 --> 18:56.060
it's gonna need all of that

18:56.060 --> 18:57.500
to push this car out of the way.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.000
Yep. The sports sedan may have the power,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.690
but can it shove the weight of the 4,000-pound taxi, too?

19:03.820 --> 19:07.420
And can this double act max out at 40 miles an hour?

19:07.420 --> 19:08.830
- You ready? - Ready.

19:08.840 --> 19:09.990
Let's do it.

19:10.290 --> 19:12.380
All right. Putting it into neutral.

19:12.740 --> 19:13.860
Parking break off.

19:13.860 --> 19:15.580
Hands off the wheel.

19:15.890 --> 19:19.950
In 3, 2, 1. Go!

19:22.820 --> 19:24.780
Amazingly, just like the movie,

19:24.780 --> 19:27.620
The sports car takes the taxi for a ride.

19:27.710 --> 19:29.880
But there's a slight problem.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.380
- I've got no steering! - 40 miles an hour!

19:32.380 --> 19:34.610
- I've got no steering! - Brakes! Brakes! Brakes!

19:34.610 --> 19:36.440
No steering! Brakes! Brakes! Brakes!

19:36.450 --> 19:37.790
I've barely got brakes.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.760
We went off course pretty fast.

19:42.350 --> 19:44.380
Off course is an understatement.

19:44.380 --> 19:47.330
The tandem cars only narrowly missed the fence.

19:48.570 --> 19:49.870
So, we got up to speed,

19:49.870 --> 19:52.370
and I guess you could call that a straight line,

19:52.370 --> 19:54.270
but, man, that was scary.

19:54.270 --> 19:55.810
The problem is that the turning axles

19:55.810 --> 19:57.300
that control the steering on our tandem car

19:57.300 --> 19:58.890
are actually in the middle.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.390
And what used to be the rear wheels are at the front,

20:01.390 --> 20:03.030
which means you have very little control over

20:03.030 --> 20:03.990
where you're going.

20:04.010 --> 20:06.740
And of course with the sports sedan pushing double the load,

20:06.740 --> 20:08.470
the brakes have to work twice as hard,

20:08.470 --> 20:11.650
and you need twice the space to come to a stop.

20:11.650 --> 20:12.960
Who knows what's gonna happen

20:12.960 --> 20:14.950
when we try to do this in reverse?

20:15.010 --> 20:15.860
All right.

20:15.860 --> 20:17.940
40 miles an hour in reverse.

20:17.940 --> 20:21.390
In 3, 2, 1. Go!

20:25.640 --> 20:26.720
20 miles an hour.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.880
Look at that! We're already off course!

20:28.880 --> 20:31.480
Once again, steering the 4-ton monstrosity

20:31.480 --> 20:33.180
is almost impossible.

20:33.550 --> 20:35.600
40 miles an hour!

20:35.850 --> 20:38.570
Ohh, no!

20:40.650 --> 20:42.330
Yeah, we got to 40!

20:42.330 --> 20:45.020
But the twin cars pull off the reverse.

20:45.330 --> 20:46.910
Right now it's looking very good for the myth.

20:46.910 --> 20:50.040
With connected cars, you can drive forwards and backwards

20:50.040 --> 20:51.280
at high speeds.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.590
You don't have much control, but it is possible.

20:53.590 --> 20:56.500
Ohh, no!

20:56.910 --> 20:59.700
Driving in a straight line may be confirmed,

20:59.700 --> 21:02.250
But there's still plenty of double driving...

21:02.250 --> 21:03.500
Start turning now.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.530
and dating to come.

21:09.850 --> 21:12.600
So, can we call it? Was that our smooth ride?

21:13.260 --> 21:14.900
Well, it started to smooth out,

21:14.900 --> 21:18.750
but then the truck broke, and the wheel came off.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.630
Yeah, that was almost bone-shattering.

21:23.630 --> 21:24.650
But it occurs to me,

21:24.650 --> 21:27.500
what if instead of all the wheels being flat,

21:27.500 --> 21:29.280
we offset two of them to a 45-degree angle?

21:29.280 --> 21:30.030
Increasing the periodicity

21:30.030 --> 21:31.220
of the points hitting the ground

21:31.220 --> 21:33.840
might make the ride smoother and easier on the truck.

21:33.850 --> 21:34.920
Yeah, that makes sense.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.320
But I start to worry

21:36.320 --> 21:38.960
that making things less symmetrical like that

21:38.960 --> 21:41.240
might set up some sort of an oscillation

21:41.250 --> 21:42.770
and a certain orientation

21:42.770 --> 21:45.050
that would end up flipping the truck.

21:45.180 --> 21:46.280
And that would suck.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.330
You're totally right.

21:47.330 --> 21:48.920
That then says to me

21:48.920 --> 21:51.560
that we want to do some small-scale testing --

21:51.630 --> 21:53.010
try different wheel orientations

21:53.010 --> 21:55.640
and see which one we feel is both safest for us

21:55.640 --> 21:57.510
but also might be easiest on the truck.

21:57.510 --> 21:58.620
- I agree. - Okay.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.570
After a bone-shaking ride

22:01.570 --> 22:04.000
with all four wheels in the same orientation,

22:04.000 --> 22:07.610
it's time to experiment with some different configurations.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.890
Now, this is the orientation we had our wheels

22:10.890 --> 22:12.190
for our most recent ride.

22:12.190 --> 22:14.880
And a bumpy ride it was.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.290
But this is not the only orientation

22:16.290 --> 22:18.180
we need to have our four wheels.

22:18.180 --> 22:19.670
We could mount two of our wheels

22:19.670 --> 22:21.590
at a 45-degree offset to the other two,

22:21.590 --> 22:22.840
thus doubling the frequency

22:22.840 --> 22:25.160
with which one of the points of the squares

22:25.160 --> 22:26.980
hits the ground for every rotation.

22:26.980 --> 22:29.640
Or we could offset each wheel

22:29.640 --> 22:32.160
by 22 1/2 degrees for every rotation,

22:32.160 --> 22:33.520
thus quadrupling the frequency

22:33.520 --> 22:35.370
with which one of the points hits the ground.

22:35.860 --> 22:38.190
Which one of these is gonna give us the smoothest ride?

22:38.420 --> 22:40.260
I haven't the slightest idea.

22:40.260 --> 22:43.600
That's why we're about to test this in small scale.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.700
And for that, they'll need a set of wheels.

22:45.700 --> 22:48.200
So Adam brings this out of the woodwork.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.760
I think that's a good start.

22:51.890 --> 22:53.910
Then it's time to tune up the treadmill

22:53.910 --> 22:54.910
to give it a run.

22:56.050 --> 22:57.380
All right, let's try this.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.900
First off, a little recap of why four in-sync wheels

23:01.900 --> 23:03.400
are so uncomfortable.

23:04.690 --> 23:08.010
But will offsetting the wheels by 45 degrees

23:08.100 --> 23:10.090
decrease the jolt factor?

23:11.190 --> 23:12.870
Much better.

23:13.260 --> 23:15.350
I didn't expect that to be so nice.

23:15.710 --> 23:17.750
Let's ramp it up. All right.

23:19.850 --> 23:22.990
Two wheels offset diagonally at 45 degrees

23:22.990 --> 23:24.410
is a clear improvement.

23:25.700 --> 23:29.560
But will the 22.5-degree combination be even better?

23:29.860 --> 23:32.240
The way this works is that one's always flat,

23:32.240 --> 23:33.410
one's always at 45,

23:33.410 --> 23:34.550
and the other two are in the middle.

23:34.550 --> 23:35.380
Okay.

23:38.180 --> 23:40.630
That's the oscillation I was worried about.

23:40.630 --> 23:41.590
That's what we don't want to do

23:41.590 --> 23:45.270
because that's what is gonna flip the truck at speed.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.250
A closer look at the 22.5 proves that the chassis

23:49.260 --> 23:52.570
is bouncing up and down and side to side,

23:52.570 --> 23:56.700
making the 45-degree offset the most stable configuration.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.960
Our small-scale tests showed that the best configuration

23:58.960 --> 24:01.370
was to have two opposing corners

24:01.370 --> 24:02.960
with their points down,

24:02.960 --> 24:05.770
the opposite two corners with their flats down.

24:05.770 --> 24:07.710
That balances things out the best,

24:07.710 --> 24:10.280
and so that's what we're gonna do full-scale.

24:16.890 --> 24:19.250
Do not try what you're about to see at home.

24:19.460 --> 24:21.620
We're what you call experts.

24:28.860 --> 24:32.040
Next, the mythbusters are going 'round the bend.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.220
All right. You ready to do this on the street?

24:34.520 --> 24:36.110
We're all gonna crash.

24:36.420 --> 24:39.850
So far our two-car monstrosity works great!

24:39.880 --> 24:42.320
But that's only in a straight line.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.250
Now it's time to take it to a curve.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.200
That's why we're here on an unmarked intersection

24:46.200 --> 24:50.530
to see how well our cars do in a real city street on a turn.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.060
Kari and I will be in the sports sedan.

24:52.060 --> 24:53.560
Tory will be in the taxi.

24:53.730 --> 24:55.140
Based on what I've seen so far,

24:55.140 --> 24:57.670
I'm not entirely sure how well this is gonna work.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.410
But, hey, if we hit the curb,

24:59.410 --> 25:00.990
at least the taxi's leading.

25:01.150 --> 25:02.770
Get off my cab!

25:03.150 --> 25:05.700
In the movie, with the sedan providing the power,

25:05.700 --> 25:08.570
the tandem cars take turns at speed.

25:08.890 --> 25:12.370
But will getting double-the-trouble round a-90-degree bend

25:12.370 --> 25:14.190
be that straight forward?

25:14.590 --> 25:15.670
Taking it to the streets.

25:15.670 --> 25:19.800
In 3, 2, 1. Go!

25:20.110 --> 25:23.200
Grant gets the conjoined car up to 40 miles per hour

25:23.200 --> 25:26.360
and then, with the corner approaching, yanks the wheel.

25:29.610 --> 25:32.950
So, our turning radius is nothing.

25:33.810 --> 25:36.750
But with the turning axles stuck in the middle of the cars,

25:36.790 --> 25:38.850
it's not looking good for the myth.

25:40.310 --> 25:41.970
This doesn't seem to be working.

25:41.970 --> 25:45.610
After repeated attempts, the mythbusters and the cars

25:45.610 --> 25:47.910
are still behind the curve.

25:47.910 --> 25:50.420
Well, you know, we're fighting so many things here,

25:50.420 --> 25:51.960
including traction.

25:51.970 --> 25:53.650
Well, in the movie it was wet outside,

25:53.650 --> 25:56.070
and we do have a fire truck on site.

25:56.070 --> 25:57.640
So, how about we slip-slide around the corner?

25:57.640 --> 26:00.070
By matching the road conditions of the movie,

26:00.070 --> 26:03.520
the theory is that water will reduce the grip of the tires

26:03.520 --> 26:05.940
and let the car drift around the bend.

26:05.950 --> 26:07.020
Slippery way.

26:07.020 --> 26:09.850
In 3, 2, 1. Go!

26:11.480 --> 26:14.180
Once again the car gets up to 40 miles per hour...

26:17.210 --> 26:20.120
but doesn't achieve the wet and wild slide.

26:22.590 --> 26:26.270
And it's clear that water alone doesn't make a difference.

26:27.950 --> 26:31.230
Dry road or wet road, we're still not making the turn.

26:31.450 --> 26:34.980
But in the movie, although the sports sedan was brand-new,

26:34.980 --> 26:37.340
the taxi, not so much.

26:37.340 --> 26:39.770
So we're gonna replicate what you might see on a taxi

26:39.770 --> 26:42.290
that's done thousands of miles of city driving --

26:42.480 --> 26:44.040
bald rear tires.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.830
Tory lays down some rubber.

26:51.730 --> 26:53.390
And soon enough the tires

26:53.390 --> 26:56.530
look like they've seen serious action.

26:56.610 --> 26:58.840
So, this is our last-ditch attempt

26:58.840 --> 27:00.820
to get this turning to work.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.510
And we've balded the tires.

27:02.510 --> 27:04.010
We're gonna have a wet road,

27:04.010 --> 27:08.010
thus reducing the traction of this set of tires.

27:08.190 --> 27:11.420
My prediction -- probably still not gonna work.

27:11.420 --> 27:13.970
I mean, we might get a better turn out of it,

27:13.970 --> 27:17.190
but, look, there's no way we're making a 90-degree turn.

27:17.220 --> 27:19.110
Well, let's find out.

27:19.570 --> 27:20.720
All right. Here we come.

27:20.720 --> 27:21.960
Taking a corner.

27:21.960 --> 27:25.520
In 3, 2, 1. Go!

27:25.830 --> 27:28.110
Once again Grant takes it to 40.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.420
Start turning now.

27:29.420 --> 27:30.450
And then...

27:32.020 --> 27:32.920
...nothing.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.440
Not much of a difference.

27:36.210 --> 27:37.350
Just like the movie,

27:37.350 --> 27:39.560
the sports sedan does all the steering,

27:39.560 --> 27:42.190
but they're still nowhere close to corner,

27:42.740 --> 27:45.970
meaning there's only one movie variable left to try.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.200
Now we're gonna switch it up.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.720
This time we're gonna have the taxi pushing the sports car.

27:49.730 --> 27:52.420
And we're thinking because the taxi is a two-wheel drive

27:52.420 --> 27:53.790
and it has bald tires

27:53.790 --> 27:55.390
that we'll be sliding more

27:55.390 --> 27:58.390
and hopefully pivot around the sports car to make the turn.

27:58.390 --> 28:00.240
It's the last chance for the myth.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.270
If the taxi can't slip the corner,

28:02.270 --> 28:05.390
then this "Date night" bend is busted.

28:05.890 --> 28:08.470
Tory guns the cab, pulls the wheel.

28:08.810 --> 28:10.640
The cars don't turn left.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.060
Instead, 50 yards downstream,

28:14.060 --> 28:16.170
they suddenly veer right.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.070
Okay, stop! Stop! Stop!

28:22.180 --> 28:23.050
By pure fluke,

28:23.060 --> 28:26.120
Tory finally got the cars around a corner,

28:26.120 --> 28:28.260
even if it was the wrong one.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.460
We made the turn!

28:30.460 --> 28:32.240
All right, maybe not the turn I wanted to make,

28:32.240 --> 28:34.120
but it still made the turn.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.540
So, why did we turn the wrong way?

28:35.540 --> 28:36.950
Well, here's my theory.

28:36.950 --> 28:40.420
See, the taxi is a regular rear-wheel-drive car.

28:40.420 --> 28:43.620
When Tory yanked the wheel, the front wheels lost traction,

28:43.620 --> 28:45.740
and that made the car unstable.

28:45.740 --> 28:48.840
Because of the wet road and the bald tires, that instability

28:48.840 --> 28:51.790
eventually resulted in the rear wheels sliding out.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.830
They happened to slide out to the left,

28:53.830 --> 28:55.930
and that meant the car turned to the right.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.880
Driving the straight line forward -- confirmed.

28:58.890 --> 29:01.370
Driving the straight line backwards -- confirmed.

29:01.810 --> 29:03.820
Cornering -- busted.

29:03.820 --> 29:06.250
We may have made the corner, but it was the wrong one,

29:06.250 --> 29:08.140
which is pretty much gonna get you killed.

29:08.230 --> 29:09.430
So, rhe real question is

29:09.430 --> 29:11.630
Can we do the most spectacular maneuver

29:11.630 --> 29:12.940
the 180 spin?

29:13.570 --> 29:15.830
I, for one, cannot wait for this one.

29:15.830 --> 29:17.010
After the break...

29:17.010 --> 29:18.560
These tracks are very interesting.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.850
They repeat about every 18 inches.

29:22.170 --> 29:24.190
A truck with square wheels passsed this way

29:24.190 --> 29:25.680
less than 20 minutes ago.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.140
We've been testing how fast we need to go

29:34.140 --> 29:36.880
in a vehicle that's got square wheels to get a smooth ride.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.890
And we've determined already that it's not as simple

29:38.890 --> 29:41.190
as just putting square wheels on your car.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.720
We put some on our truck,

29:43.730 --> 29:44.250
and we broke it.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.490
Then we figured there might be other orientations

29:50.490 --> 29:51.800
than just all four wheels flat

29:51.810 --> 29:53.130
that will give us a smoother ride.

29:53.130 --> 29:55.220
So, we tried a bunch of those out in small scale,

29:55.220 --> 29:56.860
we've got the pattern we think is gonna work,

29:56.860 --> 29:59.150
and we've come back out here to the Alameda runway.

29:59.150 --> 30:00.460
We're gonna try it again.

30:00.460 --> 30:03.200
Our lives have officially become a cartoon.

30:03.290 --> 30:05.030
With the wheel hubs back in shape

30:05.030 --> 30:06.670
after their last outing,

30:07.950 --> 30:10.140
it's time for the truck to get square.

30:10.260 --> 30:11.230
There it is.

30:11.230 --> 30:13.550
And this time two diagonal wheels

30:13.560 --> 30:16.200
are offset by 45 degrees.

30:16.310 --> 30:20.090
Our creation, she is ready to take life!

30:21.430 --> 30:24.550
But will that configuration make all the difference?

30:24.770 --> 30:26.800
Square wheels, smooth ride,

30:26.800 --> 30:29.200
45-degree diamond formation.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.710
In 3, 2, 1. Go!

30:37.080 --> 30:38.220
Yeah!

30:38.230 --> 30:39.420
Come on, baby!

30:39.420 --> 30:40.980
Oh, that's not bad!

30:41.160 --> 30:42.080
Faster!

30:42.080 --> 30:44.920
To begin with, the offset wheels are smoother.

30:45.890 --> 30:47.340
Holy @#$%…

30:48.520 --> 30:51.350
And as lead-footed Hyneman gets the truck up to speed...

30:51.350 --> 30:53.590
Dude, this is not bad!

30:54.130 --> 30:56.230
18 miles per hour!

30:56.260 --> 30:57.360
Keep going!

30:57.360 --> 30:59.280
Wow! Come on! Faster!

30:59.280 --> 31:00.940
it continues to improve.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.140
That is, until the wheels can take it no more.

31:09.700 --> 31:10.600
That was intense!

31:10.600 --> 31:11.550
That wasn't half bad

31:11.550 --> 31:13.800
when you got up to 20 miles an hour.

31:13.970 --> 31:15.520
I got no brakes, though.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.430
I think the truck didn't like it too much.

31:17.430 --> 31:19.020
I don't think it did either.

31:20.670 --> 31:23.080
Did we lose all four tires?

31:23.220 --> 31:24.270
I think so.

31:24.270 --> 31:26.960
Although one of them just sort of stayed on the track

31:26.960 --> 31:28.630
And just not on the wheel.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.180
Once we were up to speed,

31:30.180 --> 31:31.940
once we were up to the fastest speed we could get,

31:31.940 --> 31:34.140
which turns out to be about 18 miles an hour,

31:34.800 --> 31:35.830
I have to admit

31:35.830 --> 31:38.360
that I am impressed with how smooth that ride was.

31:38.360 --> 31:42.300
It was smoother than I thought it was going to be.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.790
Let's put it that way.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.240
So, how does the data look?

31:45.240 --> 31:46.340
Well, here's your speed in red.

31:46.340 --> 31:47.780
And you can see where you kind of slowed down,

31:47.790 --> 31:48.950
and there's a lot of vibration.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.260
As you sped up, the vibration in the steering column

31:51.260 --> 31:53.000
really starts to trend off.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.100
Well, that's pretty much just what we felt in the cab.

31:55.100 --> 31:56.760
- Yeah. - Awesome.

31:56.900 --> 31:59.180
The ride was progressively smoother,

31:59.180 --> 32:01.810
But it was also progressively destructive

32:01.820 --> 32:05.510
with the tires and brake pads coming off completely.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.710
Well, that was one of the worst things

32:06.720 --> 32:08.360
that ever happened to that car.

32:08.400 --> 32:09.570
It was fun, though.

32:09.580 --> 32:10.980
Absolutely.

32:10.980 --> 32:13.490
It does make me think, though.

32:13.490 --> 32:14.580
You got an idea?

32:15.030 --> 32:16.040
I do.

32:16.250 --> 32:17.250
Awesome.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.950
At the other end of the runway...

32:23.950 --> 32:25.310
You ready for the fun maneuvers?

32:25.310 --> 32:26.330
Oh, yeah.

32:26.340 --> 32:27.850
the tandem car trio

32:27.850 --> 32:30.960
are taking the "Date night" myth for its final spin.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.700
So, we have one more test to perform,

32:33.700 --> 32:36.160
and this is the finale of this sequence.

32:36.160 --> 32:40.360
Now, in a desperate attempt to finally get the two cars free,

32:40.360 --> 32:42.140
one driver turns the wheel in one direction.

32:42.140 --> 32:44.500
The other driver turns the wheel in the other direction.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.700
And instead of breaking apart, they spin around in a circle.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.380
But before we attempt that with this two-car freak show,

32:52.380 --> 32:54.760
what we need is a little practice.

32:54.900 --> 32:57.840
A little practice with practice defensive driver

32:57.840 --> 33:00.440
Alameda county sheriff Marvin Rough.

33:03.380 --> 33:06.190
You ready to teach me to drive dangerously safely?

33:06.200 --> 33:07.610
I am ready.

33:07.730 --> 33:10.950
The guys will get to grips with the 180 spin technique

33:10.950 --> 33:12.480
on a normal car first.

33:13.090 --> 33:14.850
Hand on the gearshift. Spin the wheel.

33:20.350 --> 33:22.630
Only when they've mastered this...

33:22.640 --> 33:23.120
Nice and smooth.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.720
will they unleash their two-car beast.

33:26.450 --> 33:28.020
Look at your focal point.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.330
Snap and roll, baby.

33:30.330 --> 33:32.890
And just like that, school's out.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.500
So bring on this myth's grand finale.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.730
All right, water engage.

33:38.730 --> 33:42.220
My big concern on this next test is flipping the cars.

33:42.220 --> 33:44.880
I mean, we've done this maneuver with one car,

33:44.880 --> 33:46.950
and it felt like it was gonna flip.

33:46.950 --> 33:49.270
Now that we have two, that's a lot more weight

33:49.280 --> 33:52.330
that could potentially cause these cars to roll.

33:52.490 --> 33:55.890
Flipping out is a very real possibility for this test,

33:55.890 --> 33:57.680
particularly because this time

33:57.680 --> 34:00.930
the cars are going to peak at 50 miles an hour.

34:01.020 --> 34:01.790
Okay.

34:01.790 --> 34:05.250
This is "Date night" spin-around.

34:05.250 --> 34:08.219
3, 2, 1. Go!

34:08.620 --> 34:11.530
For the last time, Tory puts the pedal to the metal

34:11.530 --> 34:14.760
and pushes their conjoined colossus up to speed.

34:14.770 --> 34:16.790
40. 50 miles.

34:16.790 --> 34:19.030
Then the moment they hit the wet patch,

34:19.030 --> 34:21.179
Tory and Kari turn their steering wheels

34:21.179 --> 34:23.420
in opposite directions, and...

34:23.989 --> 34:25.260
Oh, yeah!

34:25.260 --> 34:27.330
That's what I'm talking about!

34:27.380 --> 34:29.940
What do you know? A 180 spin.

34:30.290 --> 34:33.179
- Not quite as clean as the movie... - Oh, yeah!

34:33.179 --> 34:35.340
But a 180 nonetheless.

34:35.590 --> 34:37.770
That's better than coffee.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.440
I think I popped my back tires.

34:42.670 --> 34:44.929
It's true that both rear tires popped,

34:44.929 --> 34:47.620
but they're the only things worse for wear.

34:47.909 --> 34:48.909
It worked!

34:48.909 --> 34:51.630
We got the cars to spin just like in the movie!

34:52.159 --> 34:53.199
That was awesome.

34:53.210 --> 34:54.739
I think we have to call that confirmed.

34:55.190 --> 34:56.270
Well, we've done a little research,

34:56.270 --> 34:57.470
and as it turns out,

34:57.470 --> 34:59.870
in order to achieve this effect in the movie,

34:59.870 --> 35:01.170
the special-effects artist

35:01.170 --> 35:04.930
built one giant, single chassis for both cars.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.660
All wheels had steering,

35:06.660 --> 35:09.380
and they had castor wheels underneath to stabilize.

35:09.390 --> 35:10.720
The actors weren't driving.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.460
The driver was actually in the trunk.

35:13.460 --> 35:15.250
And we achieved the very same effect

35:15.250 --> 35:17.550
with nothing but good old bald tires.

35:19.110 --> 35:20.350
Well, that was good fun.

35:20.350 --> 35:21.840
Well, it ain't a date with a mythbuster

35:21.840 --> 35:22.960
till the wheels come off.

35:22.960 --> 35:23.870
So it was a good date.

35:23.870 --> 35:25.050
It was a good date.

35:29.780 --> 35:31.600

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600

{n8}{pos(267,215)}▇▇▇

35:35.380 --> 35:37.450
In the ultimate square wheel finale,

35:37.450 --> 35:39.730
Jamie's got a dirty idea.

35:39.730 --> 35:40.990
Coming up on "Mythbusters"...

35:40.990 --> 35:43.450
We literally reinvent the wheel.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.580
Maybe.

35:50.270 --> 35:52.510
No one knows when the wheel was invented,

35:52.510 --> 35:55.450
But the oldest known wheel was discovered in mesopotamia

35:55.460 --> 35:57.480
and was likely built by the Sumerians

35:57.480 --> 35:59.830
around 5,500 years ago.

36:05.060 --> 36:08.050
At the waste management facility in Altamont,

36:08.050 --> 36:10.420
This is like the weirdest sport ever.

36:10.930 --> 36:11.900
Aah, sorry.

36:11.920 --> 36:15.540
It's like bowling towards a hoosier with witches' hats.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.440
I don't know what you would call that.

36:17.600 --> 36:21.870
the Mythbusters are making the earth move for Jamie's big idea.

36:22.320 --> 36:24.220
It looks great from here, Jamie.

36:24.990 --> 36:25.950
Good.

36:26.690 --> 36:27.470
Let's face it.

36:27.470 --> 36:30.600
there's a very good reason they don't put square wheels on cars.

36:30.650 --> 36:32.010
Come on! Faster!

36:33.810 --> 36:36.060
But you know that started me thinking,

36:36.210 --> 36:37.720
maybe there are circumstances

36:37.730 --> 36:40.040
where square wheels would be the best thing.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.410
Like what if you had a really steep hill

36:42.410 --> 36:44.540
covered with loose dirt that you wanted to climb?

36:44.540 --> 36:46.650
That is where this comes in!

36:46.650 --> 36:49.690
A smooth slope leading to an almost vertical wall

36:49.690 --> 36:51.460
and filled with loose dirt.

36:51.460 --> 36:54.720
This is the ultimate testing ground to compare the efficacy

36:54.730 --> 36:57.880
of square wheels versus round wheels.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.690
50 feet high and with varying degrees of steepness,

37:02.060 --> 37:03.350
This ought to be fun.

37:03.350 --> 37:06.690
this hill has exactly the kind of off-road conditions

37:06.690 --> 37:10.460
for the ultimate test of the Mythbusters' square wheels.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.440
Here's how this test is gonna go.

37:12.490 --> 37:14.770
First we're gonna take the truck with its round wheels,

37:14.780 --> 37:17.720
I'm gonna drive it up that slope as far as we can make it.

37:17.730 --> 37:20.140
Let's say we make it about halfway up.

37:20.140 --> 37:23.260
Editors, will you give me a dotted line halfway up the slope?

37:23.420 --> 37:24.390
Thank you.

37:24.560 --> 37:27.090
Then we're gonna bolt the square wheels to the truck,

37:27.090 --> 37:29.120
and we're going to take the same slope

37:29.120 --> 37:30.940
and see if we can make it farther.

37:31.220 --> 37:35.700
If we can, we have literally reinvented the wheel.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.300
Well, I think everything's in place.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.360
Shall we suit up and do the round-wheel test?

37:39.360 --> 37:40.930
- I don't see why not. - All right.

37:40.930 --> 37:43.780
If we can't, we've just proven what we already suspected:

37:43.820 --> 37:45.330
square wheels are stupid.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.850
It's a simple plan,

37:47.850 --> 37:48.850
You ready?

37:49.120 --> 37:50.170
I am now.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.700
and it all comes down to Jamie's theory

37:52.700 --> 37:56.890
on why square wheels could work better on loose ground.

37:56.890 --> 37:58.320
When it comes to soft surfaces,

37:58.320 --> 37:59.590
the thing about round wheels

37:59.590 --> 38:02.250
is that all of the weight of the vehicle

38:02.250 --> 38:04.930
is right here where it contacts the ground.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.370
The PSI. There is very high.

38:07.370 --> 38:11.260
That means that it will easily sink through soft stuff and get buried.

38:11.260 --> 38:13.850
Also, as it tries to roll forward,

38:13.850 --> 38:17.060
it tends to plow that soft stuff ahead of it,

38:17.060 --> 38:19.470
which makes it hard to climb out of things.

38:19.470 --> 38:23.850
And that's why in things like sand or snow or loose dirt

38:23.850 --> 38:24.910
And we're stuck.

38:24.910 --> 38:26.080
you get stuck.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.120
On the other hand, our square wheel

38:28.120 --> 38:30.910
has this entire surface contacting the ground,

38:30.910 --> 38:34.380
which means that the PSI is gonna be a small fraction

38:34.380 --> 38:36.510
of what it would be under a round tire.

38:36.610 --> 38:38.420
And then when you try to move forward,

38:38.420 --> 38:40.800
instead of just plowing into the dirt,

38:40.850 --> 38:42.910
it's gonna actually cut into it

38:42.910 --> 38:46.380
and actually lever the whole vehicle ahead.

38:46.380 --> 38:47.890
At least that's the theory.

38:49.050 --> 38:50.240
That's the theory.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.250
So it's time to get trucking.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.240
Round-wheel, hill-climbing control test.

38:55.300 --> 38:58.490
In 3, 2, 1.

39:06.990 --> 39:08.410
You think that's as high as you can go?

39:08.410 --> 39:09.460
I think so.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.490
That's pretty darn high!

39:13.980 --> 39:14.970
Halfway up the hill,

39:14.970 --> 39:17.860
and the round wheels can't get a grip on the loose earth.

39:17.860 --> 39:20.460
So the benchmark to beat has been set,

39:20.720 --> 39:21.950
What do we do now?

39:22.340 --> 39:23.170
I don't know.

39:23.170 --> 39:24.280
Back down slowly?

39:24.280 --> 39:26.640
Well, if I can.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.820
which means the Mythbusters must return to the start line

39:31.550 --> 39:33.080
That is intense.

39:33.090 --> 39:34.780
and swap out the wheels.

39:36.100 --> 39:36.900
It's on.

39:37.030 --> 39:38.300
It's like one of those

39:38.300 --> 39:40.690
"What are we doing?" moments.

39:41.050 --> 39:42.590
Our round wheels got us about

39:42.590 --> 39:45.650
halfway up the loose dirt on the steep part.

39:45.830 --> 39:48.360
Now, we're never gonna get all the way up

39:48.370 --> 39:50.660
because, well, it's vertical up there

39:50.660 --> 39:51.870
and we just can't do that.

39:51.870 --> 39:53.440
But the square wheels --

39:53.580 --> 39:55.900
I think they're gonna get us most of the way there.

39:56.150 --> 39:59.530
This is square wheels, the final hill climb.

39:59.810 --> 40:02.750
In 3, 2, 1.

40:02.750 --> 40:03.850
Go!

40:05.180 --> 40:07.070
Oh, yeah. Come on, baby.

40:08.890 --> 40:09.790
Yes!

40:09.790 --> 40:11.350
Yes! Yes!

40:11.350 --> 40:13.280
Go! Break that rope!

40:13.280 --> 40:14.750
Break it! Yeah!

40:14.750 --> 40:17.570
Come on! Faster! Go a little more!

40:17.750 --> 40:20.190
Oh! No.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.400
Just like the round wheels,

40:22.400 --> 40:24.060
the spinning square wheels

40:24.060 --> 40:26.250
can't get purchase on the loose ground.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.310
All right. We're going up real slow now.

40:28.310 --> 40:30.010
Hill climbing in square wheels.

40:30.050 --> 40:31.110
Go.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.220
So for take two,

40:32.230 --> 40:35.000
the Hyneman goes for a slow and steady approach.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.230
This is promising.

40:44.850 --> 40:46.130
We're moving forward.

40:46.230 --> 40:47.660
We are moving forward.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.190
You know what?

40:53.300 --> 40:54.220
What?

40:54.230 --> 40:55.670
I don't think they're working.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.790
I don't think they're working either.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.430
We tied at best.

40:59.430 --> 41:00.760
We touched the tape.

41:00.930 --> 41:03.990
It seems the Mythbusters had to reinvent the wheel

41:03.990 --> 41:06.830
to discover that square wheels are just too...

41:07.000 --> 41:08.390
well, square.

41:09.690 --> 41:12.780
Well, that was fricking spectacular.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.450
We start climbing the hill. I'm feeling really good.

41:17.450 --> 41:21.960
I can only imagine the volume rooster tail of dust we're kicking up.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.150
We get up to the tape! We're touching the tape!

41:24.150 --> 41:25.600
I'm thinking, "We're gonna break the tape!"

41:25.600 --> 41:27.020
More! More!

41:27.020 --> 41:28.870
And then we just stayed stationary.

41:28.870 --> 41:31.930
We made it exactly as far up this hill

41:31.980 --> 41:33.800
as we did in our round wheels.

41:33.810 --> 41:36.420
I can't think of any better test to donstrate

41:36.420 --> 41:40.470
that there is really a specific advantage to the square tires.

41:40.470 --> 41:41.650
Well, there you have it.

41:41.650 --> 41:42.950
At best our square wheels

41:42.950 --> 41:46.460
did the same job the round wheels did on this course.

41:46.930 --> 41:48.920
I got to say I'm disappointed in it, though,

41:48.920 --> 41:52.900
because I really think there's something to these wheels.

41:52.900 --> 41:55.870
There may be other environments out there

41:55.870 --> 41:58.990
where they would actually prove superior to round wheels.

41:58.990 --> 42:02.420
But as of this point, they're not.

42:03.610 --> 42:04.770
So, how do you want to call this?

42:04.770 --> 42:06.990
Do square wheels give you a smooth ride?

42:06.990 --> 42:09.160
Well, as ridiculous as it may seem,

42:09.160 --> 42:11.090
I think we got to call that one plausible.

42:11.090 --> 42:12.290
What about hill climbing?

42:12.290 --> 42:13.870
That one, not so much.

42:13.880 --> 42:15.360
The square wheels didn't provide

42:15.360 --> 42:18.110
any kind of significant advantage over the round wheels.

42:18.110 --> 42:19.750
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?

42:19.750 --> 42:21.030
You want to drive back to the shop?

42:21.040 --> 42:23.830
No, let's walk. It's more comfortable.

42:24.950 --> 42:27.170
OK, I think this is the last time we see square wheels.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.880
Not by long shot.

42:34.660 --> 42:36.410
Wanna know why we did what we did,

42:36.410 --> 42:37.940
and didn't do what we didn't do?

42:37.940 --> 42:39.520
