01:51.150 --> 01:53.110
<i>My dear children,</i>

01:53.485 --> 01:58.282
<i>it is now better than several years
since I moved to new York</i>

01:58.490 --> 02:02.578
<i>and I haven't seen you
as much as I would like to.</i>

02:03.078 --> 02:06.832
<i>I hope you will come to this ceremony
of papal honors,</i>

02:07.041 --> 02:09.418
<i>given for my charitable work.</i>

02:11.879 --> 02:15.007
<i>The only wealth in this world is children.</i>

02:15.174 --> 02:18.302
<i>More than all the money and power
on Earth.</i>

02:19.053 --> 02:21.514
<i>You are my treasure.</i>

02:22.973 --> 02:25.267
<i>Anthony and Mary,</i>

02:25.476 --> 02:30.231
<i>although I entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interest,</i>

02:30.397 --> 02:36.570
<i>I look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.</i>

02:37.738 --> 02:42.535
<i>Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration,</i>

02:42.701 --> 02:48.040
<i>and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.</i>

02:48.958 --> 02:53.754
<i>Anyway, I remain your loving father.</i>

03:23.659 --> 03:26.745
Hail Mary, full of grace...

03:29.790 --> 03:32.918
...blessed art Thou amongst women...

03:33.085 --> 03:36.672
...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb,
Jesus.

03:37.506 --> 03:41.427
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

04:06.285 --> 04:12.333
Almighty God, bless the insignia
of Saint Sebastian the Martyr,

04:12.500 --> 04:18.755
that it may contribute to the sacredness
of him to whom it is given.

04:31.644 --> 04:38.567
Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful
to the noble purposes of this Order,

04:38.734 --> 04:43.280
to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

04:43.489 --> 04:45.366
I do so promise.

05:00.881 --> 05:03.801
May the blessing of Almighty God,

05:03.968 --> 05:08.931
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

05:09.098 --> 05:14.478
descend upon you
and remain with you forever.

06:48.030 --> 06:51.367
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

06:53.285 --> 06:56.288
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-l-N-l.

06:58.874 --> 07:01.418
- Problem?
- My name isn't on the list.

07:01.585 --> 07:06.382
- Then you have to leave immediately.
- You want to dance with me?

07:06.590 --> 07:09.218
Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

07:09.385 --> 07:12.137
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

07:12.304 --> 07:14.515
Welcome to the party.

08:07.318 --> 08:11.322
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you. This is my husband.

08:11.488 --> 08:14.241
- Sit down.
- My son, Anthony.

08:14.742 --> 08:19.914
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honors the Church awards.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.166
It was first granted by Pope...

08:22.333 --> 08:25.753
What about Mr Corleone's connections
with gambling?

08:26.253 --> 08:28.172
The press kits have...

08:28.339 --> 08:32.092
- And involvement with the underworld?
- Cut the crap.

08:32.342 --> 08:35.346
The Pope, the Holy Father himself,

08:35.513 --> 08:40.267
has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

08:41.018 --> 08:44.145
Vincent! She loves you.

08:44.313 --> 08:46.148
Yeah?

08:49.902 --> 08:51.362
I love you too.

08:57.409 --> 09:00.829
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

09:02.206 --> 09:06.377
- From where?
- The last party we were at together.

09:06.544 --> 09:10.840
- Did you come to the club?
- No, it was a wedding.

09:11.882 --> 09:15.094
I was eight and you were 1 5.

09:15.469 --> 09:18.430
I had many girlfriends when I was 1 5.

09:18.597 --> 09:20.808
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially them.

09:22.893 --> 09:25.187
Where's Mary?

09:25.354 --> 09:29.942
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

09:30.317 --> 09:34.613
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always kiss.

09:34.780 --> 09:38.450
- Now we 're related?
- I'm your little cousin.

09:45.833 --> 09:49.253
- Who's your father?
- I'll give you a hint.

09:50.296 --> 09:52.089
He's Italian.

09:53.424 --> 09:55.885
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

09:56.051 --> 09:59.722
Remember to keep your voice low.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.725
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

10:22.578 --> 10:26.624
The honorary chairman of
the Vito Corleone Foundation:

10:26.957 --> 10:30.461
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.096
Thanks.

10:41.805 --> 10:47.228
I think I inherited my father's love
for speech-making. Here it goes.

10:48.479 --> 10:52.983
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the poor in every country,

10:53.150 --> 10:57.780
gives grants to artists,
funds medical research,

10:57.947 --> 11:02.701
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

11:02.868 --> 11:04.954
Archbishop Gilday,

11:05.120 --> 11:11.544
here is 1 33 million dollars for the poor
of Sicily, in the name of Vito Corleone.

11:12.127 --> 11:14.922
Don't spend it all in one place.

11:33.816 --> 11:37.862
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

11:44.493 --> 11:46.328
Michael...

11:46.495 --> 11:49.915
You've done a wonderful thing for Sicily.

11:50.082 --> 11:54.003
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

11:54.211 --> 11:55.588
Amen.

11:58.090 --> 12:00.634
...the most important part:
Johnny Fontane!

12:09.059 --> 12:12.146
Thank you very much.
I'm happy to be here.

12:12.313 --> 12:17.651
I would like you to join me in honoring
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

12:22.198 --> 12:25.451
I have something special
for our godfather.

12:25.659 --> 12:30.164
I happen to know his favorite song.
Michael, where are you going?

12:30.331 --> 12:34.502
I'm off to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

12:35.211 --> 12:37.963
Your favorite song: "Salsiccia's Own".

12:38.130 --> 12:41.717
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
I'll be back.

13:15.668 --> 13:17.753
Hello, Kay.

13:27.471 --> 13:30.683
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honor.

13:30.850 --> 13:33.978
But a little expensive, wouldn't you say?

13:36.272 --> 13:39.441
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

13:53.372 --> 13:56.333
- It's been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.044
- Eight years.
- Yeah.

13:59.211 --> 14:01.589
You look wonderful.

14:04.675 --> 14:09.638
Your son has something he wants to
talk to you about. I came here for him.

14:44.006 --> 14:50.012
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- He wants his life to be in music.

14:51.347 --> 14:55.851
Music is great, I love music.
But he should finish what he started.

14:56.018 --> 14:57.561
Anthony...

14:57.728 --> 15:00.940
- I'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

15:01.106 --> 15:02.733
- Professional singer?
- Yes.

15:02.900 --> 15:06.278
What happens if you fail?

15:06.445 --> 15:10.574
- I won't fail.
- Men always believe that.

15:10.741 --> 15:14.662
A law degree is like taking out insurance.

15:14.870 --> 15:19.166
- After that you can work for me...
- I will never work for you.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.711
I have bad memories.

15:23.420 --> 15:26.173
Every family has bad memories.

15:29.718 --> 15:34.056
I'll always be your son, but won't have
anything to do with your business.

15:36.684 --> 15:40.729
Anthony... finish the law degree.

15:41.939 --> 15:43.524
No.

16:00.332 --> 16:04.503
Well, that he got from you. That "no".

16:07.339 --> 16:12.845
- You could've helped me convince him.
- Convince him of what?

16:13.012 --> 16:15.139
Of what?

16:15.306 --> 16:20.186
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

16:21.020 --> 16:23.397
This is greatness?

16:23.939 --> 16:28.569
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

16:28.736 --> 16:33.240
I preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

16:34.074 --> 16:35.826
Okay.

16:36.452 --> 16:40.039
- Can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

16:46.837 --> 16:49.882
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

16:56.055 --> 16:59.308
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

16:59.475 --> 17:04.688
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

17:08.943 --> 17:11.779
I spent my life protecting my son.

17:11.945 --> 17:15.616
I spent my life protecting my family!

17:15.824 --> 17:18.618
Let's be reasonable, okay?

17:18.993 --> 17:23.874
That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?
Reason.

17:24.415 --> 17:28.420
- Backed up by murder.
- Oh, God.

17:29.797 --> 17:33.217
- You hate me. You hate me.
- No.

17:33.425 --> 17:35.511
I don't hate you.

17:36.929 --> 17:39.473
I dread you.

17:42.226 --> 17:48.649
I did what I could, Kay, to protect all
of you from the horrors of this world.

17:49.984 --> 17:52.820
But you became my horror.

18:01.954 --> 18:05.875
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

18:08.419 --> 18:10.713
That's something.

18:12.548 --> 18:16.719
We can build on that. For their sake.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.974
Let's try.

18:22.141 --> 18:27.521
Only if you let Tony go free to have
his own life, away from you.

18:34.778 --> 18:37.323
I'll let Tony go.

18:39.033 --> 18:40.993
Thank you.

19:15.236 --> 19:17.530
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:19.281 --> 19:24.495
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

19:24.662 --> 19:27.122
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

19:27.331 --> 19:32.378
No. I'm a relative, but I can't do that.
What else can I do for you?

19:33.045 --> 19:35.840
- Handsome, but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

19:36.006 --> 19:38.968
- That's okay, I'll gamble.
- Do you like to gamble?

19:39.134 --> 19:42.972
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

19:43.180 --> 19:47.351
- How will I know what numbers to bet?
- Do I look like a loser?

19:47.518 --> 19:49.478
Well...

19:51.397 --> 19:53.774
Spooky-looking guy there.

19:54.358 --> 19:59.154
- What's a guy like that doing here?
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

19:59.363 --> 20:02.074
- You know him?
- Yeah, I do.

20:02.241 --> 20:07.121
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him "The Ant".

20:07.288 --> 20:10.374
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

20:18.716 --> 20:20.926
Don Altobello.

20:21.802 --> 20:25.723
- I've come to pay my respects.
- "Grazie."

20:28.726 --> 20:31.437
You honor my father's friendship.

20:31.604 --> 20:35.107
Where is my god-daughter?

20:35.316 --> 20:38.068
- Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

20:38.235 --> 20:43.032
It was not so long ago
that I held you in these old hands.

20:50.956 --> 20:56.086
Michael, I've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

20:56.253 --> 21:02.009
I've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

21:02.176 --> 21:08.974
My duty to God is clear.
I have a special favor to ask of you.

21:10.059 --> 21:17.525
Can I attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

21:17.691 --> 21:23.322
so that you and I can be joined
in name and spirit?

21:25.282 --> 21:30.162
- One million dollars.
- A lot of money...

21:32.957 --> 21:36.961
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

21:40.089 --> 21:44.260
Come, let's go and sample
some of that old "vino."

21:51.016 --> 21:54.270
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

21:54.478 --> 21:55.855
Good.

21:56.021 --> 22:00.901
I have a tendency to worry. We've
increased our position substantially.

22:01.110 --> 22:06.407
- Naturally, I worry.
- Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

22:06.615 --> 22:10.619
Good. How do you think
I got this gray hair?

22:10.786 --> 22:15.166
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

22:15.374 --> 22:19.545
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

22:19.712 --> 22:22.173
- We can always use a good judge.
- Thanks.

22:22.339 --> 22:23.883
Andrew!

22:24.049 --> 22:28.220
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

22:28.387 --> 22:32.433
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.770
- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
- Rome needs fine young priests.

22:36.937 --> 22:40.274
His mother Theresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

22:40.649 --> 22:42.401
Honored to meet you.

22:42.776 --> 22:45.863
Mr Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

22:46.906 --> 22:51.660
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me, that maybe you'd see me.

22:51.827 --> 22:55.080
- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
- No.

22:55.289 --> 22:58.584
- You promised to stay out there, twice.
- I know.

23:00.753 --> 23:04.507
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

23:04.715 --> 23:08.636
<i>He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.</i>

23:08.844 --> 23:14.058
- Do I have to see him?
- He says you're his "patron."

23:17.478 --> 23:19.688
Hey, Vinnie!

23:20.231 --> 23:23.067
- Who's your favorite aunt?
- You are.

23:25.569 --> 23:29.156
Today I'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

23:29.824 --> 23:33.577
If you'd warned me, I would have
worn a better suit.

23:34.620 --> 23:37.748
The Meucci Association
has elected you

23:37.915 --> 23:40.668
Italian-American Man of the Year.

23:42.127 --> 23:44.338
Meucci...

23:46.549 --> 23:49.093
Who's Meucci?

23:49.301 --> 23:55.140
The Italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

23:59.103 --> 24:02.273
And this is the reason
you've come today?

24:09.530 --> 24:11.740
l...

24:13.784 --> 24:16.328
I've got a stone in my shoe.

24:17.746 --> 24:20.708
A two-bit punk who works for me.

24:20.875 --> 24:25.045
The one who thinks he's related to you.

24:26.714 --> 24:28.674
A bastard.

24:32.011 --> 24:36.599
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.604
Bring him in.

24:42.730 --> 24:46.025
I think it's good that we talk.

24:46.317 --> 24:48.360
No, "grazie."

24:50.029 --> 24:52.406
I have a problem...

24:52.573 --> 24:58.829
...and I want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

24:59.038 --> 25:04.710
Your business is your business. I have
no interests or percentages from it.

25:05.336 --> 25:09.006
Good. Then it's my problem.

25:12.885 --> 25:17.139
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

25:19.475 --> 25:22.478
- How are you, Mr Corleone?
- How are you?

25:22.645 --> 25:26.315
- Good. How are you? Good party.
- You like it?

25:26.482 --> 25:29.735
- Yes, I had to sneak in.
- You're dressed for it.

25:34.406 --> 25:39.078
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr Joe Zasa?

25:40.538 --> 25:44.917
- Just trouble. I'll take care of it.
- That's foolish of you.

25:45.376 --> 25:50.589
Foolish of me? It's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you think? Right?

25:51.715 --> 25:55.386
- Right?!
- Temper like his father...

25:55.553 --> 25:57.847
Vincent...

25:58.889 --> 26:04.186
Mr Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New York.

26:04.353 --> 26:08.440
Out of kindness, he gave you
a job in his family.

26:08.607 --> 26:11.443
You took it against my advice.

26:11.610 --> 26:16.574
I offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

26:16.740 --> 26:21.787
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

26:23.664 --> 26:25.708
- Am I a gangster?
- No...

26:25.916 --> 26:30.254
That was Papa's neighborhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

26:30.421 --> 26:34.008
- That's the past, Connie.
- I earned that territory.

26:34.216 --> 26:38.053
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

26:38.220 --> 26:39.597
Yes.

26:39.763 --> 26:44.310
I came for the party, not to ask for help.
I could kill this bastard.

26:44.518 --> 26:46.729
So kill him.

26:47.354 --> 26:50.357
What does all this have to do with me?

26:50.524 --> 26:55.654
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone".

26:55.863 --> 26:58.407
Say it to his face, one time!

26:59.909 --> 27:05.122
Mr Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

27:05.289 --> 27:08.959
What am I going to do with this guy?!

27:14.465 --> 27:19.178
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

27:19.345 --> 27:21.805
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone"...

27:23.390 --> 27:27.436
...what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

27:28.854 --> 27:31.899
He's a fucking dog.

27:38.155 --> 27:41.575
Yes, it's true. If anyone would say
such a thing,

27:41.784 --> 27:45.371
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

27:51.335 --> 27:57.258
- My interests don't conflict with his.
- You don't know how much they do.

27:57.424 --> 27:59.093
Quiet, Vincent.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.387
He needs your support!

28:01.554 --> 28:05.307
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

28:05.474 --> 28:11.397
As what? Tough guy? I don't need
tough guys. I need more lawyers.

28:13.691 --> 28:19.947
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
I accept your tribute. I wish you well.

28:21.699 --> 28:26.412
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr Joe Zasa. Go on.

28:36.964 --> 28:39.258
<i>Bastardo...</i>

28:44.388 --> 28:47.266
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?!

28:47.433 --> 28:49.727
Get him out of here.

28:51.061 --> 28:53.105
Jesus Christ...

28:54.190 --> 28:57.359
- I told Connie this wasn't the right time.
- Close it.

28:57.526 --> 29:01.197
I know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

29:01.405 --> 29:04.283
I want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't .

29:04.450 --> 29:08.037
- But you can?
- Yeah, I can do that.

29:08.662 --> 29:10.706
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

29:10.915 --> 29:13.876
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

29:14.043 --> 29:17.379
I say we make him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

29:17.588 --> 29:19.632
- You'll do it?
- Yeah.

29:23.802 --> 29:28.766
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

29:28.974 --> 29:32.061
- Okay.
- See if you learn.

29:32.895 --> 29:36.398
And we'll talk about your future.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.610
I won't let you down.

29:45.574 --> 29:47.952
It's about ready.

29:53.582 --> 29:54.959
What happened?

29:55.125 --> 29:58.963
If I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? I bit his ear off.

29:59.129 --> 30:02.132
Here we go. Watch the card.

30:04.552 --> 30:05.928
Hold it!

30:08.264 --> 30:10.057
- Vincent...
- Yeah.

30:10.224 --> 30:12.768
Take the picture with us.

30:19.775 --> 30:22.069
Nice jacket.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.031
Closer to the center, sir.

30:28.909 --> 30:30.703
Smile!

30:50.014 --> 30:55.227
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

30:55.853 --> 30:58.230
Do you want to do it?

31:43.984 --> 31:46.821
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

32:46.547 --> 32:49.925
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

32:51.886 --> 32:54.263
Do you love me?

32:55.055 --> 32:59.435
- Come on, go to bed.
- Come on, say it.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.896
I love you.

33:02.062 --> 33:04.732
I love you, too.

33:06.442 --> 33:08.652
You've got a cat?

33:14.992 --> 33:18.245
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.956
Come on.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.966
Well, I guess I know my place.

33:31.550 --> 33:35.054
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

33:35.262 --> 33:39.433
"Get me water, bake me a cake"...
What happened to "please"?

34:27.147 --> 34:30.025
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.871
- Let her go.
- Cut her throat, man.

34:44.206 --> 34:47.458
- What did you say?
- Cut her fucking throat.

34:50.337 --> 34:53.674
- Okay, chief...
- Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

34:53.841 --> 34:57.595
I hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

34:59.763 --> 35:03.517
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

35:03.684 --> 35:07.855
If you do, I'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.399
Cut her throat! Right now!

35:11.525 --> 35:16.405
I'll do something that'll convince you.
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

35:21.410 --> 35:22.995
Oh, shit!

35:25.039 --> 35:27.500
Drop the knife. Drop it!

35:27.666 --> 35:33.589
Good boy. Sit down, I want to talk
to you. It was a wise choice. Sit down.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.509
Lose the mask.

35:39.345 --> 35:42.765
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

35:44.475 --> 35:47.603
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

35:47.937 --> 35:50.689
Tell me who sent you.

35:52.816 --> 35:55.569
- No one.
- Did you take a look at this guy?

35:55.736 --> 35:58.113
- Yeah.
- Who sent you?

36:00.783 --> 36:03.160
It was Joey Zasa.

36:17.591 --> 36:20.135
Are you okay?

36:22.429 --> 36:25.558
- You were going to let them kill me!
- No, I wasn't ...

36:25.724 --> 36:29.061
You pig! You sick fuck!

36:30.271 --> 36:34.441
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

36:38.863 --> 36:42.867
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

36:43.033 --> 36:46.620
It was self-defense.
Go ahead, call the police.

36:47.454 --> 36:49.498
- No, no...
- I'm taking pictures.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.001
No pictures.

36:53.252 --> 36:54.670
<i>You had a gun!</i>

36:54.837 --> 36:59.884
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

37:00.092 --> 37:04.013
Zasa sent them.
I just sent him a message.

37:04.722 --> 37:09.935
- Now he has to send you one back.
- Is Zasa going to send me one back?

37:10.102 --> 37:12.980
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

37:13.147 --> 37:18.360
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a "pazzo."

37:20.446 --> 37:23.324
All right. You are what you are.

37:23.657 --> 37:26.660
It's your nature. Stay close to me.

37:26.827 --> 37:30.664
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

37:30.873 --> 37:34.001
- And you do what I tell you.
- I understand.

37:34.168 --> 37:38.088
- I have problems with the Commission.
- I know.

37:38.255 --> 37:43.052
- You don't make them easier.
- It wasn't my idea that this happened.

37:43.219 --> 37:46.138
- Get out of here.
- Michael...

37:46.305 --> 37:48.390
Yes?

37:48.891 --> 37:53.687
- Now they'll fear you.
- Maybe they should fear "you."

37:56.774 --> 38:00.528
- B.J., what's up?
- The Archbishop just called back.

38:00.736 --> 38:03.739
We've arranged some amazing things.

38:03.906 --> 38:08.869
The publicity is phenomenal. You're the
new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.

38:10.037 --> 38:13.791
- Sign here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

38:13.999 --> 38:19.213
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himself.

38:19.755 --> 38:22.591
Man to man. But we 're different.

38:22.758 --> 38:27.638
No different than any large corporation.
We control a lot of money with little.

38:27.847 --> 38:32.643
Minimize taxes.
With no government control.

38:41.402 --> 38:44.822
- Godfather.
- Andrew.

38:46.490 --> 38:51.120
- Off to Rome...
- I wanted to thank you for everything.

38:51.287 --> 38:54.415
- Do you want some breakfast?
- Thanks, I can't .

38:54.582 --> 38:58.586
- How's your Italian?
- "Devo fare un po' di pratica."

38:59.795 --> 39:02.173
- His father was a great lawyer.
- I know.

39:02.339 --> 39:06.969
Didn't live to see him ordained. I did.
Did you ever see one of those?

39:07.178 --> 39:10.764
Beautiful. I was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

39:11.932 --> 39:15.060
If you hear any rumors in the Vatican,
let me know.

39:15.227 --> 39:18.063
No, Andrew has the true faith.

39:26.989 --> 39:28.866
<i>Don Corleone,</i>

39:29.033 --> 39:33.579
I need your help. And not just
to light a little candle.

39:34.830 --> 39:41.837
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

39:42.588 --> 39:47.551
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

39:49.386 --> 39:52.473
...but I was never a true banker.

39:55.309 --> 39:59.813
"Mea culpa." I trusted my friends.

40:00.814 --> 40:03.192
Friendship and money...

40:04.068 --> 40:05.861
Oil and water...

40:06.028 --> 40:07.696
Indeed.

40:07.863 --> 40:14.870
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

40:15.871 --> 40:18.541
If money was lost...

40:19.583 --> 40:22.253
...then I am to blame.

40:22.878 --> 40:28.759
If only prayer could pay off
our 733 million dollar deficit.

40:30.427 --> 40:33.180
769 million...

40:38.769 --> 40:43.983
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation: Immobiliare.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.902
You know the one I mean?

40:47.111 --> 40:52.324
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

40:54.076 --> 40:56.078
That's true.

40:56.245 --> 41:00.416
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

41:02.918 --> 41:05.963
No, you're mistaken.

41:06.130 --> 41:10.509
This isn't a question of one person
deciding, one deciding vote.

41:10.676 --> 41:16.599
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

41:17.433 --> 41:22.313
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

41:26.358 --> 41:28.652
We've sold the casinos.

41:30.196 --> 41:34.116
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

41:34.325 --> 41:40.122
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

41:42.917 --> 41:47.796
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
533 million dollars in the Vatican Bank

41:48.005 --> 41:51.133
when Mr Corleone receives
majority control of Immobiliare.

41:51.300 --> 41:56.847
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

41:57.890 --> 42:02.228
Few families have control
of such a company.

42:05.314 --> 42:08.192
It seems that, in today's world,

42:08.359 --> 42:13.572
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.909
633 million dollars.

42:21.747 --> 42:25.584
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.004
Don Corleone,

42:29.213 --> 42:34.260
this deal with Immobiliare can make you
one of the richest men in the world.

42:34.426 --> 42:39.974
Your whole past history, and the history
of your family, would be washed away.

42:43.811 --> 42:46.355
633 million.

43:01.495 --> 43:06.458
<i>"The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal"</i>

43:06.667 --> 43:12.298
<i>"to acquire 100 million newly-issued
Class A voting shares"</i>

43:13.883 --> 43:20.639
<i>... Corleone capital invested directly
into International Immobiliare,</i>

43:20.806 --> 43:24.727
<i>an old and respected
European company.</i>

43:24.894 --> 43:30.274
Mr Corleone has an ambitious programme
to expand this real estate company

43:30.441 --> 43:33.444
into an international conglomerate...

43:36.906 --> 43:41.869
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

43:42.077 --> 43:45.080
Mr Corleone, excuse me.

43:45.247 --> 43:48.918
Didn't you recently deposit 233 million
in the Vatican Bank,

43:49.084 --> 43:52.046
which is affiliated with Immobiliare?

43:52.213 --> 43:53.756
True. Why not?

43:53.923 --> 43:59.386
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

44:00.137 --> 44:02.681
Mr Chairman, if I may?

44:04.058 --> 44:08.687
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

44:08.896 --> 44:12.233
has made an endowment
of 1 33 million dollars.

44:12.399 --> 44:16.654
The money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the Vatican.

44:16.821 --> 44:19.448
Does that answer your question?

44:19.573 --> 44:25.955
I have always believed that helping your
fellow man is profitable in every sense,

44:26.163 --> 44:28.666
personally and bottom line.

44:28.999 --> 44:34.672
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

44:34.797 --> 44:38.843
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets,

44:39.009 --> 44:44.098
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

44:44.682 --> 44:47.351
Thank you for your time.

44:47.518 --> 44:52.189
I hope that you will look favorably
on my proposal. Thank you.

44:57.736 --> 45:00.781
Let me have this microphone here.

45:00.948 --> 45:06.245
Will we let a criminal run our company?
He's got the map of Sicily on his face!

45:06.412 --> 45:07.955
Order!

45:08.122 --> 45:11.167
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

45:12.835 --> 45:17.548
The Hamilton Investors Group
cannot support this proposal.

45:18.132 --> 45:19.508
Your Excellency...

45:20.593 --> 45:22.136
Mr Chairman...

45:22.928 --> 45:29.185
...the Vatican Bank feels
that international Immobiliare...

45:31.103 --> 45:35.232
...will be safe in Mr Corleone's hands.

45:35.399 --> 45:40.362
...subject to audit and final ratification,
which must take place in Rome.

45:40.571 --> 45:44.492
Please join me in welcoming
Mr Michael Corleone.

45:54.502 --> 45:56.337
Dad?

45:58.589 --> 46:02.343
Tony says that I'm a front
for the foundation.

46:03.552 --> 46:07.306
That you're using me to pull the strings.

46:07.473 --> 46:10.601
- To get the money where you want it.
- Please!

46:10.768 --> 46:13.938
- To shine up your public image.
- Mary!

46:14.688 --> 46:18.859
Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

46:21.278 --> 46:26.325
I wanted Anthony to be part of it.
I thought you would be together on this.

46:26.492 --> 46:30.871
I won't interfere.
I'll help, but only if you ask.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.707
What is this really for?

46:33.874 --> 46:38.671
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing this?

46:38.879 --> 46:44.009
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

46:44.426 --> 46:47.638
This foundation is supposed to
help all people?

46:47.805 --> 46:49.348
That's the purpose.

46:50.224 --> 46:55.020
This is legitimate.
Mary, I swear, this is legitimate.

46:59.066 --> 47:02.570
Dad, I want this to bring me
closer to you.

47:10.286 --> 47:14.707
I would burn in Hell to keep you safe.

47:28.387 --> 47:31.307
Go in the other car. I'll ride with Michael.

47:31.473 --> 47:33.517
Go, go, go.

47:47.198 --> 47:53.204
As your family's oldest friend, I'm
always chosen to bring you messages.

47:55.456 --> 47:58.584
Tell me, Don Altobello.

48:00.169 --> 48:04.340
Your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them.

48:04.507 --> 48:06.884
They worship you...

48:07.927 --> 48:14.016
...but their hearts are broken, because
they think you abandoned them.

48:14.517 --> 48:20.689
They want to share your deal
on Immobiliare, to be a family again.

48:21.065 --> 48:23.776
It can purify their money.

48:25.820 --> 48:28.364
This I cannot do.

48:30.324 --> 48:34.161
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

48:35.371 --> 48:37.915
I know.

48:38.082 --> 48:40.709
But they're unhappy.

48:42.253 --> 48:44.171
And you?

48:44.338 --> 48:50.427
I ask nothing for myself,
only peace in my old age.

48:50.636 --> 48:54.306
But I must please the world around me.

48:55.516 --> 49:02.022
Michael, your father was a
reasonable man. Learn from him.

49:04.108 --> 49:07.695
I learned many things from my father.

49:12.908 --> 49:18.664
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

49:19.915 --> 49:23.127
We will make the peace, you and l.

49:31.051 --> 49:33.095
<i>The Vatican announced today...</i>

49:33.262 --> 49:37.558
<i>that Pope Paul VI has canceled
his Sunday blessing...</i>

49:37.725 --> 49:39.935
<i>due to ill health.</i>

49:40.144 --> 49:45.858
<i>His physician has ordered
total bedrest...</i>

49:46.025 --> 49:48.903
<i>and cessation of all activities.</i>

50:02.583 --> 50:08.172
They've had a press conference. The
Pope's condition is grave. "Gravissimo."

50:35.115 --> 50:40.412
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

50:40.579 --> 50:44.667
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

50:45.459 --> 50:47.545
Please...

50:47.711 --> 50:52.383
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

50:52.550 --> 50:55.678
against the Corleone control.

50:56.136 --> 51:01.183
The Vatican has cast its vote. Corleone
Group already controls the Board.

51:01.475 --> 51:06.188
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican vote must be ratified here.

51:06.355 --> 51:09.024
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

51:12.486 --> 51:16.073
The Pope is gravely ill.

51:17.032 --> 51:21.287
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

51:21.829 --> 51:24.832
- What if he dies?
- Then...

51:25.791 --> 51:29.044
...as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

51:29.211 --> 51:31.881
Gentlemen, please.

51:32.631 --> 51:36.927
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

51:40.931 --> 51:44.268
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

51:44.727 --> 51:50.441
I advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

51:51.525 --> 51:53.277
We had an agreement!

51:54.570 --> 51:58.407
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

51:58.616 --> 52:03.746
- Please sit down.
- I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

52:03.913 --> 52:09.418
The Immobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

52:10.085 --> 52:13.506
I understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

52:13.714 --> 52:16.842
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

52:17.009 --> 52:22.223
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
- Remember you are in the Vatican.

52:24.934 --> 52:31.023
- What is it that you want?
- Yes, you will take control.

52:31.690 --> 52:35.778
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

52:35.945 --> 52:40.032
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

52:41.325 --> 52:47.498
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

52:49.208 --> 52:55.714
It's not personal. It's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

52:59.093 --> 53:00.594
Very well.

53:01.762 --> 53:06.809
You want to do business with me?
I will do business with you.

53:07.810 --> 53:10.521
Vipers, all of them.

53:15.776 --> 53:18.904
- We 're back with the Borgias!
- Uncle Michael...

53:19.071 --> 53:22.074
- Andrew!
- I heard you were here.

53:22.241 --> 53:26.662
It's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

53:26.829 --> 53:29.999
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

53:35.546 --> 53:38.465
- Recognize it?
- Yeah.

53:39.258 --> 53:44.138
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

53:44.346 --> 53:47.266
Three years later he owned it.

53:47.725 --> 53:50.853
- Only in America.
- That's it.

53:51.020 --> 53:56.233
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

53:56.400 --> 54:00.571
- What can I do for you?
- Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

54:00.738 --> 54:05.242
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

54:05.409 --> 54:07.620
Where should they be now?

54:07.828 --> 54:10.956
- Lou, what's going on?
- We 're late.

54:12.791 --> 54:15.336
- Have I ever let you down?
- I trust you.

54:15.544 --> 54:17.922
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

54:18.130 --> 54:19.924
Enjoy yourselves.

54:26.347 --> 54:30.851
- What was that?
- The neighborhood's in trouble.

54:31.268 --> 54:34.021
- Do you keep an eye out for them?
- Yes.

54:34.188 --> 54:37.191
- And for me?
- From now on.

54:38.025 --> 54:42.029
- I've missed you all this time.
- I missed you too, cousin.

54:42.196 --> 54:47.409
I missed growing up with my cousins.
I didn't even know you, but missed you.

54:48.035 --> 54:52.540
Do you remember stories
about our fathers? The old days?

54:52.706 --> 54:55.835
Yeah, what do you want to know?

54:57.461 --> 55:03.384
- What was Sonny like?
- Well, he was the Prince of the City.

55:04.343 --> 55:08.264
He died before I was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

55:09.807 --> 55:13.561
- What about my father?
- He's a great man.

55:14.854 --> 55:17.690
He's a hero. He saved the family.

55:18.941 --> 55:20.985
- Vincent?
- What?

55:21.193 --> 55:23.737
Did he kill his own brother?

55:27.867 --> 55:29.743
No.

55:31.745 --> 55:34.290
So, it's all lies?

55:37.459 --> 55:41.213
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

55:44.967 --> 55:46.760
Okay.

55:48.095 --> 55:50.389
I believe you.

55:50.598 --> 55:54.685
- I'm glad you're around.
- I'm glad you're here too.

55:59.190 --> 56:01.233
<i>Cugina...</i>

56:01.442 --> 56:03.527
Cous...

56:17.333 --> 56:20.711
I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

56:20.878 --> 56:23.631
Joey Zasa is nothing.

56:23.797 --> 56:27.635
He's a small-time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

56:27.843 --> 56:31.847
He's nothing. You can see him coming
a mile away.

56:32.515 --> 56:35.643
- We should kill him before he...
- No!

56:38.187 --> 56:42.983
Never hate your enemies.
It affects your judgment.

56:58.666 --> 57:01.377
Nice to see you again, Mr Corleone.

57:21.856 --> 57:24.608
Hey, girls. Let's go.

57:41.792 --> 57:46.255
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

57:46.422 --> 57:52.261
It's not even 23 years. You've sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us.

57:52.428 --> 57:54.805
Bravo, Don Corleone!

57:56.640 --> 57:58.017
Thank you.

57:58.976 --> 58:06.275
Friends, I have come here
because our business together is done.

58:07.401 --> 58:09.195
We have prospered,

58:09.361 --> 58:15.326
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

58:16.619 --> 58:18.662
That's it.

58:18.829 --> 58:22.333
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

58:24.710 --> 58:27.338
Your shares in the casinos.

58:27.505 --> 58:31.675
I've cut the red tape, so you could
get your money right away.

58:38.307 --> 58:40.601
53 million dollars!

58:40.810 --> 58:44.230
- Not everybody gets the same.
- Nothing for you...

58:44.438 --> 58:50.319
- It depends on your investment.
- Michael, this is really generous!

58:50.486 --> 58:51.862
Wonderful!

58:54.865 --> 59:00.204
- Parisi, how much did you invest?
- I don't remember.

59:00.371 --> 59:02.414
You're blessed.

59:07.002 --> 59:12.424
My family has done much of
the hard work, taken many risks.

59:14.051 --> 59:17.096
All to make money
for the rest of the families.

59:19.515 --> 59:22.059
You all know Joey Zasa.

59:22.393 --> 59:25.521
He is, I admit, an important man.

59:26.021 --> 59:30.359
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.

59:30.526 --> 59:35.322
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best-dressed gangster.

59:35.489 --> 59:37.449
The newspapers praise him

59:37.616 --> 59:42.163
because he hires Blacks,
which shows he has a good heart.

59:44.748 --> 59:47.042
He is famous.

59:47.209 --> 59:53.257
Who knows? Maybe one day
he'll make all of you popular.

59:54.925 --> 59:56.302
It's true.

59:56.468 --> 01:00:01.932
I make more of a "bella figura."
That is my nature.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:06.979
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

01:00:07.188 --> 01:00:09.899
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:15.404
Sure, I take the Blacks and the Spanish
into my family,

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:18.866
because that's America.

01:00:19.617 --> 01:00:23.787
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:30.127
I don't guarantee that. I guarantee
that I'll kill anybody who does.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:39.178
- Let me talk to him.
- Who can refuse Don Altobello?

01:00:39.595 --> 01:00:42.556
- Joey, are you...
- No!

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:48.479
I say to all of you: I have been
treated this day with no respect.

01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:54.568
I've earned you all money. I've made
you rich and I asked for little.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:59.281
Good. You will not give, so I'll take!

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:02.701
As for Don Corleone,

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:08.999
he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:15.464
You must choose between us.

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.178
No, Joey!

01:01:22.263 --> 01:01:25.266
Michael, we could reason together.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.017
No.

01:01:28.227 --> 01:01:32.606
Michael, please... let's agree.

01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:35.151
He doesn't know what he's ...

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:37.194
No, no.

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:44.827
Michael, the news is everywhere.

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:49.290
Everyone says that you
control Immobiliare.

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:55.045
Immobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

01:01:55.963 --> 01:02:00.718
We've worked with you for 43 years.
We should wet our beaks a little.

01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:06.098
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right, we've been together...

01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:18.694
- It's a hit! Let's go!
- Let's get out of here! Move!

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:40.758
My coat! It's my lucky coat!

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.844
It's my lucky coat!

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:52.311
Stay behind me!

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:09.286
Mikey, this way!

01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:20.923
Zasa, you son-of-a-bitch...

01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:44.238
Come on. We 're out of here.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.564
- You did good, Vincent.
- "Grazie."

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:22.193
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

01:04:22.401 --> 01:04:25.362
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.991
- Altobello?
- He survived.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:34.497
He's with his daughters in Staten Island.
He says he's going to retire in Sicily.

01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:41.003
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:46.884
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attack.

01:04:47.051 --> 01:04:51.430
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

01:04:51.597 --> 01:04:54.517
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:02.983
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:14.036
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:20.000
I respect what he's done.

01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:23.754
The new overthrows the old. It's natural.

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:27.675
How can you do business
with this guy?

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:33.055
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict.

01:05:33.222 --> 01:05:38.185
- Tell him that he can live or he can die.
- Vincent, will you shut up!

01:05:56.078 --> 01:05:58.122
That's it.

01:05:59.915 --> 01:06:01.792
Joey Zasa...

01:06:02.001 --> 01:06:04.795
He can't be doing this alone.

01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:13.012
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

01:06:20.769 --> 01:06:26.567
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

01:06:30.946 --> 01:06:32.698
Michael!

01:06:39.205 --> 01:06:43.375
- Has he had his medicine?
- I don't know what he took.

01:06:45.628 --> 01:06:49.632
- I've got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:52.676
- Run, run, run!
- Vincent!

01:06:52.843 --> 01:06:54.970
Run at thunder, girl! Thunder can't hurt!

01:06:56.722 --> 01:06:59.266
Harmless noise!

01:06:59.433 --> 01:07:04.188
Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!

01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:07.399
Altobello, you fuck!

01:07:10.444 --> 01:07:12.321
Fredo!

01:07:12.738 --> 01:07:14.240
Fredo!

01:07:37.763 --> 01:07:40.808
Oh, God! Dad!

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:45.020
Excuse me.

01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:47.231
I'll call Kay.

01:07:57.449 --> 01:08:01.620
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:14.508
Mr Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

01:08:14.717 --> 01:08:19.846
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

01:08:20.014 --> 01:08:24.810
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

01:08:25.019 --> 01:08:27.145
The Pope has not much time left.

01:08:28.647 --> 01:08:32.693
So, as you, I am in a difficult position.

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:36.863
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

01:08:37.031 --> 01:08:40.158
- We have an understanding.
- Good.

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:45.288
- I'm going to the hospital.
- I'll pray for Mr Corleone.

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:53.631
- Our thoughts are with Mr Corleone.
- Thank you, Father Jim.

01:08:56.008 --> 01:09:00.429
Everything would be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:03.307
Play for time, Keinszig.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:08.895
A habit born of a long contemplation
of eternity.

01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:19.365
- Forget about it, Vinnie.
- Why? It's a simple hit.

01:09:19.532 --> 01:09:25.453
I'd love to smack Joey Zasa and then
whack the fag. But it's impossible.

01:09:25.621 --> 01:09:31.085
He's always with people, in front of TV
cameras in his own neighborhood.

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:34.755
- It's not impossible. It'll work for us.
- How?

01:09:34.964 --> 01:09:39.844
Do you think he's going to let
Uncle Michael survive? Would you?

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:42.930
He may not survive anyway.

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:47.268
- How would you do it?
- I'd do it myself.

01:09:48.853 --> 01:09:50.979
Do it!

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:55.609
- What would you need?
- A couple of guys.

01:10:26.348 --> 01:10:28.726
Hello, Michael.

01:10:31.103 --> 01:10:33.147
It's Kay.

01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:39.361
Kay...

01:10:41.405 --> 01:10:43.866
I never expected you.

01:10:44.283 --> 01:10:46.577
No, I know.

01:10:48.913 --> 01:10:50.789
But I'm here.

01:10:54.502 --> 01:10:57.046
- I'm glad.
- You know...

01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:02.676
I've never seen you looking so helpless.

01:11:07.139 --> 01:11:09.809
It's not so bad, really.

01:11:11.143 --> 01:11:15.648
I feel... I'm getting wiser now.

01:11:15.815 --> 01:11:18.192
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:18.901 --> 01:11:24.782
- The sicker you get, the wiser you get?
- When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:30.704
Michael... I want to thank you for Tony.

01:11:33.499 --> 01:11:37.878
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices,

01:11:38.045 --> 01:11:43.759
and he'll make his operatic debut
in Sicily, in Palermo this Easter, so...

01:11:45.219 --> 01:11:46.887
So, thank you.

01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:51.684
That's a real honor. In Sicily.

01:11:56.355 --> 01:11:59.567
I will be there. I won't miss that.

01:12:00.192 --> 01:12:02.069
I won't miss that.

01:12:08.117 --> 01:12:10.661
Mary, Tony...

01:12:11.954 --> 01:12:14.248
Go see Dad.

01:12:19.295 --> 01:12:22.882
- Sweetheart!
- Everything's going to be all right.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.552
- Tony!
- How are you doing, Pop?

01:12:28.637 --> 01:12:31.932
Your mother told me what happened.

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:38.022
- About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.
- Of course. Kiss me.

01:12:57.458 --> 01:13:03.214
- "Cousin Vinnie?"
- He's not here. Call his apartment.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.967
- It's your cousin Mary.
- Let her in.

01:13:10.888 --> 01:13:15.017
Hi, cous. I thought I'd drop by.
Is that okay?

01:13:15.184 --> 01:13:17.853
I'll get the guys.

01:13:18.938 --> 01:13:22.525
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

01:13:23.609 --> 01:13:26.070
Only a couple of minutes, okay?

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:30.825
- You look beautiful, cous.
- Thanks.

01:13:33.285 --> 01:13:36.705
So this is your club, your hideout?

01:13:36.872 --> 01:13:40.125
- Yeah.
- I came here to check it out.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:48.551
It's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

01:13:48.717 --> 01:13:53.347
- I feel better when I'm with you.
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

01:13:53.556 --> 01:13:56.267
- I'm scared about my father.
- Don't be.

01:13:56.433 --> 01:14:00.938
When they took him out of
the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

01:14:01.105 --> 01:14:04.233
Everybody says he's going to be better.

01:14:05.067 --> 01:14:07.111
Don't worry.

01:14:07.319 --> 01:14:10.197
I remember a shooting when I was little.

01:14:11.365 --> 01:14:16.328
And one time AI Neri and other
bodyguards took me and Tony away.

01:14:17.872 --> 01:14:21.000
Is it all happening again?

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:24.086
Not like that, sweetie.

01:14:25.337 --> 01:14:29.967
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

01:14:30.926 --> 01:14:35.806
Nothing's going to happen
to me, "cugina." We'll take care of you.

01:14:46.233 --> 01:14:50.779
- Can I stay here and hide out with you?
- Can you help me cook for the boys?

01:14:50.946 --> 01:14:55.117
You know that I don't know
how to cook, but I'll help.

01:15:07.505 --> 01:15:09.590
Okay...

01:15:09.757 --> 01:15:11.842
What do I do?

01:15:43.666 --> 01:15:47.253
- I love you, cous.
- I love you, too, cous.

01:15:50.506 --> 01:15:52.883
Let us cook.

01:16:08.941 --> 01:16:10.985
Hold me.

01:16:47.188 --> 01:16:51.859
You in the press and the police
use words like "Mafia" , "Cosa Nostra."

01:16:52.026 --> 01:16:57.490
This is a fantasy. We Italian-Americans
laid the bricks that built this city.

01:16:57.656 --> 01:17:00.201
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

01:17:00.409 --> 01:17:04.079
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

01:17:04.246 --> 01:17:08.334
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

01:17:09.627 --> 01:17:12.087
The salsiccia is wonderful!

01:17:12.296 --> 01:17:14.507
Here, have a sandwich.

01:17:27.269 --> 01:17:31.273
- Nice to see you, Mr Zasa.
- Have a nice time.

01:17:32.233 --> 01:17:35.361
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

01:17:37.738 --> 01:17:41.075
- What are you doing?
- He didn't mean it.

01:17:41.283 --> 01:17:44.703
- Tell him you're sorry.
- Okay, let's go.

01:18:03.013 --> 01:18:05.558
Joey! How are you?

01:18:06.433 --> 01:18:09.186
How are you, Buddy boy?

01:18:09.353 --> 01:18:13.107
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.194
- Who is this? Do you know him?
- Ignore him.

01:18:17.361 --> 01:18:21.115
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:27.121
This is what gives Italian-Americans
a bad name. A "cappone" like this.

01:18:27.288 --> 01:18:29.582
Joey, up your ass!

01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:32.710
Get off the car!
Do you have a raffle ticket?

01:18:33.502 --> 01:18:36.839
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.343
Here's what I think of you...
and your raffle ticket.

01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:45.181
Get the fuck off this car.
I'll break your fucking balls.

01:18:47.766 --> 01:18:50.478
Get out of here!

01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:09.246
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

01:19:21.175 --> 01:19:22.551
Open the door!

01:19:23.135 --> 01:19:26.013
How are you, Joe?

01:19:28.224 --> 01:19:29.600
Zasa!

01:19:47.117 --> 01:19:54.083
Don't ever again give that kind of order.
Not while I'm alive.

01:19:54.458 --> 01:19:56.335
Understand?

01:19:57.503 --> 01:20:03.676
You were too sick to make a decision.
I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:06.387
Connie?

01:20:15.688 --> 01:20:18.941
It was the right decision, Uncle Mike.

01:20:19.108 --> 01:20:22.862
It was the wrong decision.
I command this family!

01:20:23.487 --> 01:20:25.614
Right or wrong...

01:20:26.407 --> 01:20:29.368
...it was not what I wanted!

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.680
Do you understand?

01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:57.605
Yes.

01:21:04.361 --> 01:21:06.113
Come on, Michael.

01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:19.627
Yes.

01:21:21.128 --> 01:21:27.134
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.
I want to talk to you alone for a minute.

01:21:35.226 --> 01:21:40.022
You know, I always felt
responsible for you.

01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:42.316
You know that.

01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:44.485
Your father...

01:21:45.444 --> 01:21:48.864
...my brother, we were opposites.

01:21:49.031 --> 01:21:54.078
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

01:21:54.286 --> 01:21:59.083
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

01:22:02.461 --> 01:22:06.715
Too much. It clouded his reason.

01:22:07.842 --> 01:22:11.220
I don't want you to make that mistake.

01:22:13.347 --> 01:22:15.641
Also...

01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:18.978
...he, too, had a way with women.

01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:22.773
- Vincent...
- So I hear.

01:22:22.982 --> 01:22:25.442
What are you doing with my daughter?

01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:31.198
What are you doing with her?

01:22:34.869 --> 01:22:37.163
It's too dangerous.

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:41.834
Do you hear me?

01:22:47.506 --> 01:22:49.592
Okay.

01:23:03.314 --> 01:23:05.524
Vincenzo...

01:23:08.944 --> 01:23:13.908
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

01:23:21.415 --> 01:23:24.710
Michael, you must lead another life.

01:23:24.877 --> 01:23:30.341
You have everything a man could
desire. It's time for you to retire.

01:23:31.050 --> 01:23:34.011
I have too much responsibility.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:40.351
Immobiliare? It's too difficult now.
You should really get out.

01:23:40.643 --> 01:23:45.606
What do you know
about those "pezzi da novanta" in ltaly?

01:23:49.151 --> 01:23:52.988
I'm too old to know anything
about those new people.

01:23:53.197 --> 01:23:57.910
I must accept my age
and grow my olives and tomatoes.

01:23:58.994 --> 01:24:03.415
- We 're not that old.
- But you're very ill.

01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:08.712
Michael... Let me see
what can be done.

01:24:08.921 --> 01:24:13.300
Let me work to make your path
a little easier.

01:24:13.467 --> 01:24:19.056
- Your friendship does that always.
- That makes me happy.

01:24:19.223 --> 01:24:23.394
Joey Zasa... You were wrong
about him.

01:24:24.395 --> 01:24:28.315
I trust too much.
That's always been my fault.

01:24:35.823 --> 01:24:39.869
Michael... treachery is everywhere.

01:24:40.035 --> 01:24:44.456
You still have your fingers
on the strings, even now.

01:24:45.416 --> 01:24:48.544
Let's see more of each other.

01:24:48.711 --> 01:24:53.299
- Michael, in Sicily?
- In Sicily.

01:24:53.841 --> 01:24:55.885
<i>In Sicilia.</i>

01:24:56.177 --> 01:24:58.804
<i>In Sicilia.</i>

01:25:45.976 --> 01:25:48.020
How are you?

01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:50.773
Don Bendino, my old friend.

01:26:22.513 --> 01:26:28.102
I brought you here so that my old friend
and protector, Don Tommasino,

01:26:28.269 --> 01:26:30.312
could advise us.

01:26:30.521 --> 01:26:34.567
What do you think about Altobello?

01:26:36.652 --> 01:26:38.737
A very talented man.

01:26:38.904 --> 01:26:43.659
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

01:26:43.826 --> 01:26:46.495
The saint of reason.

01:26:48.289 --> 01:26:52.293
A blood-bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

01:26:52.459 --> 01:26:55.588
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship,

01:26:55.754 --> 01:26:59.675
but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

01:26:59.842 --> 01:27:04.346
- Step back in...
- Or the Chinese and Colombians will.

01:27:04.513 --> 01:27:10.102
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:15.191
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

01:27:15.774 --> 01:27:22.198
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

01:27:24.492 --> 01:27:28.329
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

01:27:28.496 --> 01:27:33.459
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

01:27:35.377 --> 01:27:39.423
"Our ships must all sail
in the same direction"...

01:27:40.591 --> 01:27:46.347
Italian politics have had these men
for centuries. They are the true Mafia.

01:27:46.514 --> 01:27:49.809
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

01:27:49.975 --> 01:27:54.271
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

01:27:54.814 --> 01:27:57.441
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:02.071
They totally protect him.

01:28:02.279 --> 01:28:06.700
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

01:28:06.867 --> 01:28:10.621
Someone we can tell
our problem to?

01:28:11.705 --> 01:28:13.749
Cardinal Lamberto.

01:28:13.958 --> 01:28:19.380
A wise and good man...
very influential.

01:28:19.547 --> 01:28:22.550
He will see you.

01:28:27.555 --> 01:28:33.435
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

01:28:35.104 --> 01:28:39.984
You honor your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

01:28:40.484 --> 01:28:43.028
They have no honor.

01:28:44.822 --> 01:28:46.657
My word is final.

01:28:57.293 --> 01:29:01.213
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

01:29:23.777 --> 01:29:30.451
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's debut in an opera house...

01:29:30.618 --> 01:29:33.746
We'll play "Philadelphia".

01:29:33.913 --> 01:29:38.334
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

01:29:38.501 --> 01:29:41.170
...in the opera "Cavallaria Rusticana".

01:29:41.337 --> 01:29:45.090
- It's "Cavalleria Rusticana", Dad.
-"Cavalleria".

01:29:45.257 --> 01:29:50.471
I think I have tickets to the wrong opera.
I've been in New York too long.

01:29:51.347 --> 01:29:54.767
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

01:29:54.975 --> 01:29:58.103
Dad, I've got a present for you.

01:30:00.898 --> 01:30:05.528
It comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

01:30:06.570 --> 01:30:09.990
And... I learned it for you.

01:31:39.163 --> 01:31:44.919
<i>She was wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her. And then she died.</i>

01:31:46.045 --> 01:31:51.258
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

01:31:52.718 --> 01:31:55.763
She drove it before I did.

01:31:56.305 --> 01:31:59.975
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

01:32:00.142 --> 01:32:01.519
History.

01:32:01.685 --> 01:32:06.398
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

01:32:06.607 --> 01:32:10.194
- Yes, it was then.
- I worry about you now.

01:32:10.361 --> 01:32:15.574
Oh, Mary, you're such a
warm-hearted girl. You always were.

01:32:15.741 --> 01:32:19.662
- I love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

01:32:23.249 --> 01:32:25.376
I really love him.

01:32:26.585 --> 01:32:30.923
- He's your first cousin.
- Then I love him first.

01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:33.926
Mary, you can't see him.

01:32:34.426 --> 01:32:37.388
Just don't see him anymore.

01:32:37.555 --> 01:32:41.392
He's right. It's too dangerous.

01:32:43.352 --> 01:32:46.480
Mary, you can't see him anymore.

01:32:46.647 --> 01:32:49.108
- Not in that fashion.
- No.

01:32:50.568 --> 01:32:54.238
- Please, promise me.
- No!

01:32:54.405 --> 01:32:56.532
- Obey me on this.
- No, Dad!

01:33:01.954 --> 01:33:06.709
Mary is smart, Dad.
She'll understand eventually.

01:33:29.106 --> 01:33:32.234
<i>Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.</i>

01:33:43.329 --> 01:33:46.457
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

01:33:46.624 --> 01:33:50.294
I want you to do something for me.
It's dangerous.

01:33:52.046 --> 01:33:55.549
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

01:33:55.716 --> 01:33:59.386
I want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello.

01:33:59.595 --> 01:34:02.139
To betray me.

01:34:04.767 --> 01:34:07.645
He'd never believe me.

01:34:07.812 --> 01:34:11.065
- That depends.
- Sit down.

01:34:13.150 --> 01:34:15.611
I have an idea.

01:34:16.278 --> 01:34:20.950
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

01:34:23.911 --> 01:34:26.372
Arrange a meeting.

01:34:28.374 --> 01:34:33.504
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

01:34:33.921 --> 01:34:37.591
- Ask for his help.
- What problems?

01:34:38.968 --> 01:34:42.221
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

01:34:42.429 --> 01:34:47.393
But you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

01:34:51.397 --> 01:34:55.067
- You know that I would never do that.
- I know.

01:34:56.110 --> 01:35:01.240
<i>Ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.</i>

01:35:01.448 --> 01:35:07.037
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

01:35:07.204 --> 01:35:12.418
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

01:35:13.043 --> 01:35:17.089
I could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

01:35:17.798 --> 01:35:21.218
I could use your friendship
to persuade him.

01:35:21.844 --> 01:35:25.014
I would be indebted to you forever.

01:35:26.724 --> 01:35:30.853
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

01:35:32.146 --> 01:35:34.607
Then you would work for me?

01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:37.026
"Si."

01:35:39.653 --> 01:35:42.448
<i>Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.</i>

01:35:45.075 --> 01:35:50.122
If he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted,

01:35:50.706 --> 01:35:53.501
because that's his trap.

01:35:59.965 --> 01:36:03.469
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

01:36:06.305 --> 01:36:12.228
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

01:36:15.773 --> 01:36:19.777
- Leave the girl out of this.
- Of course, you love her.

01:36:19.944 --> 01:36:22.488
And she loves you.

01:36:42.508 --> 01:36:45.261
I guessed it, didn't l?

01:36:47.012 --> 01:36:52.601
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

01:36:52.768 --> 01:36:56.939
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

01:36:58.607 --> 01:37:01.443
It's my duty to make the introductions.

01:37:08.534 --> 01:37:10.452
Don Lucchesi.

01:37:13.038 --> 01:37:18.836
Don Altobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

01:37:19.003 --> 01:37:22.506
This is the hero who put Joey Zasa
in his grave.

01:37:22.715 --> 01:37:27.136
If we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

01:37:27.303 --> 01:37:29.847
No one wants another Joe.

01:37:31.223 --> 01:37:33.934
Let me be your friend.

01:37:34.101 --> 01:37:38.606
- Even the strongest man needs friends.
- I'm flattered.

01:37:39.607 --> 01:37:44.403
You're a man of finance and politics,
things I don't understand.

01:37:46.197 --> 01:37:50.451
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

01:37:50.993 --> 01:37:55.164
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:01.837
How can I help?

01:38:02.046 --> 01:38:03.506
<i>Vieni?</i>

01:38:06.467 --> 01:38:12.097
Blessed is the peacemaker,
for he can be called the child of God.

01:38:12.264 --> 01:38:15.059
- "Tu parli Italiano un poco?"
- "Si."

01:38:37.623 --> 01:38:40.501
The wheelchair, for Don Tommasino.

01:38:48.425 --> 01:38:52.847
I trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop. I trusted him.

01:38:53.013 --> 01:38:56.934
I was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

01:38:57.101 --> 01:39:02.064
But, as you see, I'm now
the victim of a swindle.

01:39:02.273 --> 01:39:08.237
He's stalling me. Vast monies have
gone to people in high political places

01:39:08.404 --> 01:39:11.198
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

01:39:11.365 --> 01:39:16.787
If what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

01:39:18.789 --> 01:39:23.669
Look at this stone. It has been
in the water for a very long time,

01:39:23.836 --> 01:39:28.090
but the water has not penetrated it.

01:39:31.886 --> 01:39:33.262
Look...

01:39:34.305 --> 01:39:39.435
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

01:39:39.643 --> 01:39:44.190
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity,

01:39:44.398 --> 01:39:50.362
but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

01:39:54.241 --> 01:39:58.412
- What's happening?
- Could you get me something sweet?

01:39:58.579 --> 01:40:01.999
Some orange juice, candy...

01:40:05.711 --> 01:40:08.881
I have trouble with diabetes.

01:40:11.634 --> 01:40:14.261
My blood sugar goes low.

01:40:14.428 --> 01:40:16.555
I understand.

01:40:38.994 --> 01:40:42.498
It happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

01:40:43.082 --> 01:40:45.376
I understand.

01:40:46.544 --> 01:40:50.923
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

01:40:53.467 --> 01:40:58.514
Accusations against your Archbishop.
It was difficult for me.

01:40:59.723 --> 01:41:01.684
The mind suffers

01:41:01.851 --> 01:41:05.062
and the body cries out.

01:41:08.357 --> 01:41:11.777
That's true.

01:41:14.029 --> 01:41:18.159
Would you like to make
your confession?

01:41:24.707 --> 01:41:28.127
Your Eminence, I'm ...

01:41:30.754 --> 01:41:36.844
It's been so long. I wouldn't ...
I wouldn't know where to...

01:41:37.761 --> 01:41:39.805
It's been 30 years.

01:41:40.890 --> 01:41:44.477
I'd use up too much of your time, I think.

01:41:45.227 --> 01:41:47.688
I always have time to save souls.

01:41:48.981 --> 01:41:54.111
- Well, I'm beyond redemption.
- No, no...

01:42:03.287 --> 01:42:07.750
I hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

01:42:08.334 --> 01:42:12.254
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming,

01:42:12.421 --> 01:42:15.299
and we must seize the moment.

01:42:19.512 --> 01:42:24.266
What is the point of confessing
if I don't repent?

01:42:25.726 --> 01:42:29.230
I hear you are a practical man.

01:42:29.438 --> 01:42:31.982
What have you got to lose?

01:42:43.202 --> 01:42:45.329
Go on.

01:42:51.335 --> 01:42:53.629
l...

01:42:53.838 --> 01:42:56.215
...betrayed my wife.

01:42:57.341 --> 01:43:00.094
Go on, my son.

01:43:04.557 --> 01:43:07.184
I betrayed myself.

01:43:09.562 --> 01:43:11.772
I killed men.

01:43:15.067 --> 01:43:18.195
And I ordered men to be killed.

01:43:19.071 --> 01:43:21.782
Go on, my son. Go on.

01:43:27.121 --> 01:43:28.622
It's useless.

01:43:30.541 --> 01:43:32.585
Go on, my son.

01:43:33.544 --> 01:43:35.921
I killed...

01:43:40.092 --> 01:43:43.220
I ordered the death of my brother.

01:43:43.804 --> 01:43:45.931
He injured me.

01:43:47.183 --> 01:43:50.019
I killed my mother's son.

01:43:51.103 --> 01:43:53.564
I killed my father's son.

01:44:03.824 --> 01:44:08.787
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

01:44:10.164 --> 01:44:13.459
Your life could be redeemed,

01:44:13.626 --> 01:44:18.422
but I know that you don't believe that.
You will not change.

01:44:47.993 --> 01:44:53.374
<i>Pope Paul VI, the Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church,...</i>

01:44:53.541 --> 01:44:57.294
"died last night at 9:40 p.m."

01:44:57.503 --> 01:45:01.340
<i>The Pope was 8 1 years old,...</i>

01:45:01.507 --> 01:45:04.844
<i>and had been in poor health
for the last several months.</i>

01:45:09.807 --> 01:45:11.851
Connie...

01:45:13.018 --> 01:45:17.898
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

01:45:18.107 --> 01:45:22.736
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

01:45:23.195 --> 01:45:26.949
But the higher I go,
the more crooked it becomes.

01:45:29.243 --> 01:45:32.079
Where the hell does it end?

01:45:40.421 --> 01:45:44.467
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

01:45:45.426 --> 01:45:49.805
For money, for pride, for family.

01:45:52.683 --> 01:45:57.396
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich "pezzi da novanta."

01:46:03.819 --> 01:46:06.447
I made confession, Connie.

01:46:07.156 --> 01:46:09.783
I confessed my sins.

01:46:10.784 --> 01:46:16.499
Why? That's not like you. You don't
have to confess your sins to a stranger.

01:46:16.665 --> 01:46:18.417
It was the man.

01:46:19.794 --> 01:46:23.547
He's a good man. A true priest.

01:46:27.343 --> 01:46:29.637
He can change things.

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:33.766
Michael...

01:46:34.767 --> 01:46:38.521
You know, sometimes I think
of poor Fredo.

01:46:39.605 --> 01:46:43.442
Drowned. It was God's will.

01:46:45.486 --> 01:46:48.030
It was a terrible accident.

01:46:48.989 --> 01:46:51.200
But it's finished.

01:46:56.121 --> 01:46:58.499
Michael, I love you.

01:47:00.334 --> 01:47:02.711
I'll always help you.

01:47:14.557 --> 01:47:16.642
Oh, Connie...

01:47:46.046 --> 01:47:52.845
I am honored, Don Altobello, that
you've come from Palermo to visit me.

01:47:56.348 --> 01:48:01.145
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

01:48:02.271 --> 01:48:03.939
Do the donkey for me.

01:48:21.248 --> 01:48:26.045
It's been some time since we
did business together.

01:48:29.089 --> 01:48:33.636
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

01:48:34.595 --> 01:48:40.684
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

01:48:47.650 --> 01:48:50.027
Only one stone?

01:48:52.488 --> 01:48:58.410
It's dangerous. A famous man.

01:48:58.577 --> 01:49:01.831
You will have to take precautions.

01:49:04.834 --> 01:49:10.047
Tell me what to do.
Then I will tell you my price.

01:49:14.927 --> 01:49:17.388
Ah, what bread!

01:49:21.684 --> 01:49:23.769
Olive oil...

01:49:29.024 --> 01:49:32.695
Virgin... only in Sicily.

01:49:35.239 --> 01:49:36.782
<i>Alla salute!</i>

01:49:36.949 --> 01:49:38.742
To death.

01:49:52.465 --> 01:49:54.216
Kay!

01:49:54.383 --> 01:49:56.510
- Connie!
- How are you?

01:49:56.719 --> 01:49:59.722
Mary, I've missed you.

01:50:00.347 --> 01:50:04.518
- Hello, Michael.
- Mom, look at this.

01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:13.986
- It's too bad Douglas couldn't come.
- I know. He had a very important trial.

01:50:14.153 --> 01:50:16.864
I know he wanted to come.

01:50:17.281 --> 01:50:19.408
- The car is...
- Okay.

01:50:21.243 --> 01:50:27.666
- Well, your son is an artist.
- Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

01:50:27.833 --> 01:50:32.588
- What for?
- For making me let him go.

01:50:33.088 --> 01:50:38.135
Well, after all these years,
here I am in Sicily for the first time.

01:50:38.302 --> 01:50:41.680
- I want to get a picture of you together.
- Okay.

01:50:43.516 --> 01:50:45.601
Hey, Dad. Smile!

01:50:49.814 --> 01:50:53.651
I see you still have AI Neri. Why?

01:50:53.859 --> 01:50:58.447
I need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

01:50:58.614 --> 01:51:02.785
- He carries my briefcase.
- You're still a liar, Michael.

01:51:03.702 --> 01:51:09.792
Let me show you Sicily, the "real" Sicily.
So you'll understand the family history.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.212
I think I understand it more than enough.

01:52:04.597 --> 01:52:10.436
Anthony, I have something you made
for me a very long time ago.

01:52:12.354 --> 01:52:15.399
- Might bring you luck.
- Thanks.

01:52:19.028 --> 01:52:22.281
You saved it... I remember.

01:52:26.494 --> 01:52:28.537
Thank you, Dad.

01:52:29.914 --> 01:52:31.499
I'm proud of you.

01:52:32.291 --> 01:52:34.168
Thank you.

01:52:50.017 --> 01:52:52.728
- Are they as good as they look?
- Better.

01:52:52.895 --> 01:52:57.608
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

01:52:57.775 --> 01:53:00.152
Goodbye.

01:53:02.112 --> 01:53:05.533
- Tell your father I'll be back for dinner.
- Okay.

01:53:05.699 --> 01:53:08.327
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to wait for me.

01:53:08.494 --> 01:53:10.579
I will.

01:53:12.414 --> 01:53:15.668
"Buongiorno, signora." At your service.

01:53:19.964 --> 01:53:23.467
If I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

01:53:28.556 --> 01:53:32.226
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

01:53:34.436 --> 01:53:38.899
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.154
I'll have everything ready.

01:53:46.824 --> 01:53:49.618
Do you swear?

01:53:55.875 --> 01:53:58.335
I swear to you.

01:54:28.115 --> 01:54:30.409
Here it is.

01:54:31.494 --> 01:54:34.622
The house where my father was born.

01:54:35.164 --> 01:54:40.878
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy. To kill him.

01:54:43.964 --> 01:54:45.674
Wait...

01:54:46.425 --> 01:54:48.511
Listen to that.

01:55:07.571 --> 01:55:10.616
You know Mary's in love.

01:55:10.991 --> 01:55:13.369
Yes, I know.

01:55:13.661 --> 01:55:17.873
With a handsome young Italian man
with dark eyes...

01:55:19.166 --> 01:55:21.377
I won't allow it.

01:55:23.587 --> 01:55:27.424
It's wrong. It's wrong and it's dangerous.

01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:30.594
"Oh, father, my father!"

01:55:31.011 --> 01:55:33.556
"Give me time to pray
to the Lord."

01:55:33.764 --> 01:55:38.644
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

01:55:38.811 --> 01:55:41.105
and fallen in love with her cousin.

01:55:41.313 --> 01:55:42.690
"There will be no forgiveness!"

01:55:42.857 --> 01:55:47.153
Her father stabbed her through
the heart.

01:55:59.582 --> 01:56:01.542
Honor, huh?

01:56:20.436 --> 01:56:23.564
I remember the time you came
to my parents' house

01:56:23.731 --> 01:56:27.151
and told me about the family business.

01:56:27.359 --> 01:56:32.990
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

01:56:33.532 --> 01:56:36.660
I was a lot like Tony.

01:56:43.042 --> 01:56:46.045
- I can barely see him... Kay?
- What?

01:56:46.212 --> 01:56:48.589
- Do you mind driving?
- What's wrong?

01:56:48.798 --> 01:56:51.926
My eyes. Sometimes
they're all right, but...

01:56:53.385 --> 01:56:56.222
I have to see Don Tommasino...

01:56:59.350 --> 01:57:01.352
Well...

01:57:01.852 --> 01:57:05.606
- There are no bodyguards today.
- I really snuck away.

01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:17.284
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

01:57:26.710 --> 01:57:30.631
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

01:57:31.882 --> 01:57:35.719
You were an assassin then,
and you're an assassin now.

01:57:35.886 --> 01:57:39.223
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:42.643
I will pass through the gates
with you.

01:57:58.492 --> 01:58:00.161
How are you?

01:58:00.327 --> 01:58:04.498
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

01:58:09.462 --> 01:58:12.381
- We can wait here.
- You want a drink?

01:58:17.636 --> 01:58:20.764
I spent a lot of time in this room...

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:23.767
...thinking of you.

01:58:27.021 --> 01:58:29.690
And then you got married.

01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:36.697
- I still thought of you.
- What's in that room?

01:58:40.701 --> 01:58:44.872
This is dangerous for you. This is Sicily.

01:58:47.374 --> 01:58:50.544
- I love this country.
- Why?

01:58:52.296 --> 01:58:58.385
Well, all through history, terrible things
have happened to these people.

01:58:59.094 --> 01:59:01.764
Terrible injustices.

01:59:02.431 --> 01:59:07.645
But they still expect good,
rather than bad, will happen to them.

01:59:07.853 --> 01:59:10.815
Sort of like me and you?

01:59:13.984 --> 01:59:17.488
- How so?
- I'm still here, right?

01:59:17.696 --> 01:59:20.866
We do have a bad history,
but I'm still here.

01:59:21.033 --> 01:59:23.577
Yes, you are, but with dread.

01:59:28.499 --> 01:59:30.209
Give me the order!

01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:34.380
Is that supposed to make me
not dread you?

01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:39.051
We 're in Sicily. It's opera.

01:59:40.845 --> 01:59:42.930
Okay.

01:59:44.807 --> 01:59:47.184
What do we do now?

01:59:49.770 --> 01:59:54.567
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:03.826
I want you to forgive me.

02:00:06.203 --> 02:00:09.331
- For what?
- Everything.

02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:15.713
Oh, like God?

02:00:16.422 --> 02:00:19.508
No, I need something a little closer.

02:00:22.344 --> 02:00:25.514
You couldn't understand,
back in those days.

02:00:27.057 --> 02:00:31.854
I loved my father. I swore I would
never be a man like him,

02:00:32.062 --> 02:00:36.317
but I loved him and he was in danger.
What could I do?

02:00:36.484 --> 02:00:39.904
And then later, you were in danger.

02:00:40.112 --> 02:00:44.033
Our children were in danger.
What could I do?

02:00:44.241 --> 02:00:49.914
You were all that l... loved and valued
most in the world.

02:00:51.582 --> 02:00:54.251
Now I'm losing you. I lost you.

02:00:55.127 --> 02:00:57.338
You're gone.

02:00:58.339 --> 02:01:02.009
And it was all for nothing. So...

02:01:06.096 --> 02:01:11.227
You have to understand,
I had a whole different destiny planned.

02:01:14.355 --> 02:01:17.024
All right, I'll stop.

02:01:26.867 --> 02:01:30.955
I really don't know what you
want from me, Michael.

02:01:31.122 --> 02:01:36.085
- I mean...
- I'm not the man that you think I am.

02:01:37.461 --> 02:01:41.549
- I don't know.
- I love you, Kay.

02:01:42.842 --> 02:01:45.594
Don't dread me anymore.

02:01:50.599 --> 02:01:54.645
You know, every night here in Sicily...

02:01:56.647 --> 02:02:02.153
...I dream about my wife
and my children...

02:02:05.406 --> 02:02:07.783
...and how I lost them.

02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:15.166
I guess that if it's any consolation,
I want you to know that...

02:02:18.502 --> 02:02:19.879
...that...

02:02:21.005 --> 02:02:23.757
...I always loved you, Michael.

02:02:24.925 --> 02:02:26.802
And you know...

02:02:28.429 --> 02:02:31.056
...always, I always will.

02:02:58.876 --> 02:03:00.711
What is it? What's wrong?

02:03:01.962 --> 02:03:05.049
They found Don Tommasino shot.

02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:07.843
Is he dead?

02:03:10.012 --> 02:03:13.766
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

02:03:14.183 --> 02:03:17.478
I must have revenge!

02:03:20.439 --> 02:03:25.986
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

02:03:26.487 --> 02:03:29.031
Command me.

02:03:29.490 --> 02:03:30.866
It never ends.

02:03:31.033 --> 02:03:33.494
I will avenge him!

02:03:48.425 --> 02:03:50.136
Totals...

02:03:51.846 --> 02:03:54.723
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

02:03:55.141 --> 02:03:58.060
Siri, 1 1 votes.

02:03:58.727 --> 02:04:02.648
Lamberto, 99 votes.

02:04:07.528 --> 02:04:13.159
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

02:04:13.325 --> 02:04:19.123
Oh God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

02:04:20.124 --> 02:04:21.750
I accept.

02:04:21.917 --> 02:04:24.462
By what name do you
wish to be called?

02:04:24.670 --> 02:04:27.715
John Paul the First.

02:04:57.161 --> 02:05:02.958
I will do things "right away",
rather than in "a little while"...

02:05:04.251 --> 02:05:09.548
<i>Frederick Keinszig, known as
"God'd Banker", has been reported missing.</i>

02:05:09.715 --> 02:05:16.430
<i>He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned Immobiliare.</i>

02:05:17.139 --> 02:05:21.060
<i>Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.</i>

02:05:22.144 --> 02:05:24.814
Keinszig, you fool.

02:05:27.399 --> 02:05:32.446
<i>His absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.</i>

02:05:32.613 --> 02:05:35.491
<i>For several years,
the bank and its companies</i>

02:05:35.658 --> 02:05:40.204
<i>have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.</i>

02:05:40.871 --> 02:05:45.167
Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

02:05:46.335 --> 02:05:51.048
I have phoned him.
I have waited here by the phone.

02:05:53.551 --> 02:05:58.180
<i>You would do well to remember,
Mr Lucchesi,</i>

02:05:58.347 --> 02:06:05.354
that this Pope has very different ideas
from the last one.

02:06:26.917 --> 02:06:29.211
Goodbye, my old friend.

02:06:31.589 --> 02:06:35.009
You could have lived a little longer.

02:06:35.176 --> 02:06:38.512
I could be closer to my dream.

02:06:43.684 --> 02:06:47.021
You were so loved, Don Tommasino.

02:06:51.442 --> 02:06:55.362
Why was I so feared,
and you so loved?

02:06:56.447 --> 02:06:58.657
What was it?

02:06:59.116 --> 02:07:01.952
I was no less honorable.

02:07:03.287 --> 02:07:05.581
I wanted to do good.

02:07:09.376 --> 02:07:12.797
What betrayed me?
My mind? My heart?

02:07:15.424 --> 02:07:18.260
Why do I condemn myself so?

02:07:24.391 --> 02:07:26.519
I swear,

02:07:26.727 --> 02:07:29.522
on the lives of my children...

02:07:33.484 --> 02:07:36.529
Give me a chance to redeem myself...

02:07:40.157 --> 02:07:43.911
...and I will sin no more.

02:08:07.643 --> 02:08:11.981
You look pale. Bad news?
Tell me right away.

02:08:13.899 --> 02:08:17.319
It's not just a bad banking deal.

02:08:17.528 --> 02:08:20.573
These guys are butchers.

02:08:20.739 --> 02:08:23.909
- What guys?
- Lucchesi.

02:08:25.244 --> 02:08:29.623
He controls all of them:
Altobello, the Archbishop...

02:08:30.749 --> 02:08:33.419
...others higher up, P2 maybe.

02:08:33.586 --> 02:08:37.506
Secret unknown.
They're running things.

02:08:40.509 --> 02:08:45.723
- I'm in their way.
- He's hired an assassin to kill you.

02:08:45.931 --> 02:08:49.351
A Sicilian. I don't know his name.

02:08:50.644 --> 02:08:53.105
But they say he never fails.

02:08:54.148 --> 02:08:56.692
Then no one is safe.

02:08:59.111 --> 02:09:02.448
Even the new Pope is in danger.

02:09:02.615 --> 02:09:06.619
We still have time. We can prevent this.

02:09:10.873 --> 02:09:13.709
I tried, Vincent.

02:09:15.503 --> 02:09:18.339
I tried...

02:09:18.506 --> 02:09:24.094
...to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

02:09:24.261 --> 02:09:26.639
Not in this world.

02:09:27.723 --> 02:09:29.767
Give me the order.

02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:36.357
You won't be able to go back.

02:09:36.524 --> 02:09:39.610
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

02:09:40.486 --> 02:09:43.114
All my life I wanted out.

02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:46.117
I wanted the family out.

02:09:47.451 --> 02:09:49.161
I don't want out.

02:09:49.787 --> 02:09:52.957
I want the power to preserve the family.

02:09:57.211 --> 02:09:59.672
I'm asking for the order.

02:10:20.276 --> 02:10:22.486
It's done.

02:10:23.529 --> 02:10:26.365
Because I can't do it anymore.

02:10:29.535 --> 02:10:33.539
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do.

02:10:33.706 --> 02:10:38.752
Come on outside.
Take a rest and don't think about it.

02:10:38.961 --> 02:10:43.090
- All I do is think about it.
- I'm your son.

02:10:43.257 --> 02:10:46.093
Command me in all things.

02:10:47.511 --> 02:10:50.222
Give up my daughter.

02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:55.769
That's the price you pay...

02:10:55.936 --> 02:10:58.647
...for the life you choose.

02:11:24.131 --> 02:11:26.050
Nephew...

02:11:28.177 --> 02:11:30.554
...from this moment on...

02:11:31.972 --> 02:11:34.934
...call yourself Vincent Corleone.

02:11:39.063 --> 02:11:40.731
Sit.

02:11:55.496 --> 02:11:57.581
Don Vincenzo...

02:12:03.295 --> 02:12:05.131
Don Corleone...

02:12:08.217 --> 02:12:10.928
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

02:13:44.271 --> 02:13:45.648
<i>E tu, Vincenzo...</i>

02:13:46.690 --> 02:13:51.570
I know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

02:13:52.279 --> 02:13:54.073
He's lost.

02:13:55.241 --> 02:13:56.826
Think of yourself.

02:13:58.244 --> 02:14:01.080
What's your answer, Vincent?

02:14:02.498 --> 02:14:05.209
Enjoy the opera.

02:14:06.544 --> 02:14:09.171
It's all taken care of.

02:14:13.884 --> 02:14:16.804
Check the bar. I'll check the top floor.

02:14:20.558 --> 02:14:24.854
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at the
Teatro Massimo than in the shower."

02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:27.064
"Love, Douglas."

02:14:27.231 --> 02:14:30.818
- My darling Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

02:14:31.735 --> 02:14:35.322
- This is a great occasion.
- Come, sit down.

02:14:39.201 --> 02:14:43.831
Happy birthday.
You're 83, but don't look more than 63.

02:14:43.998 --> 02:14:45.708
You're the only one who remembered.

02:14:46.125 --> 02:14:51.505
We've just got the word. The Pope has
ratified the Immobiliare deal. We've won.

02:14:51.672 --> 02:14:53.716
Congratulations.

02:14:56.093 --> 02:14:58.387
Strange how things work.

02:14:58.554 --> 02:15:03.517
The Pope is doing what you said
he'd do. He's cleaning house.

02:15:03.726 --> 02:15:08.105
He should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

02:15:13.778 --> 02:15:18.073
I want to put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

02:15:28.793 --> 02:15:32.213
On your birthday you used to
shower me with treats.

02:15:32.379 --> 02:15:34.840
Tootsie Rolls!

02:15:35.007 --> 02:15:40.513
The nuns who made this cannoli took a
vow of silence. They're the very finest.

02:15:44.183 --> 02:15:47.436
- Hey.
- Hey, cous.

02:15:49.021 --> 02:15:52.191
Hi. Where's your leather?

02:15:55.820 --> 02:15:57.363
Stop it.

02:16:03.285 --> 02:16:06.705
You're so thin. You eat it.

02:16:23.305 --> 02:16:24.682
"È buono."

02:16:25.307 --> 02:16:27.685
<i>Grazie!</i>

02:16:30.479 --> 02:16:34.733
It's over. There are things I have to do
that you can't be part of.

02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:37.945
It's not your father's decision, it's mine.

02:16:39.572 --> 02:16:42.199
Don't hate your father.

02:16:43.825 --> 02:16:47.663
There are things I'll be part of
that you can't be around.

02:16:49.707 --> 02:16:53.209
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

02:16:56.714 --> 02:17:00.885
You've got to understand, Mary.
You've got to understand.

02:17:01.427 --> 02:17:04.096
I'll always love you.

02:17:16.358 --> 02:17:17.777
Love somebody else.

02:20:59.206 --> 02:21:03.294
- They won't try anything.
- Everything's fine. It's all clear.

02:21:03.461 --> 02:21:06.505
I've already sent AI Neri to the Vatican.

02:21:18.350 --> 02:21:21.145
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

02:21:22.813 --> 02:21:27.109
I bring a message from
Michael Corleone.

02:21:28.527 --> 02:21:30.488
Let him in.

02:22:58.951 --> 02:23:00.703
<i>Buona sera.</i>

02:26:21.946 --> 02:26:24.573
Good. You got him.

02:27:16.083 --> 02:27:19.670
<i>Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.</i>

02:27:19.837 --> 02:27:24.592
<i>Keinszig...
That little Swiss banker fuck.</i>

02:27:25.759 --> 02:27:30.264
<i>He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.</i>

02:27:31.182 --> 02:27:33.851
<i>Don Lucchesi, my friend.</i>

02:27:34.018 --> 02:27:37.104
<i>Calo will pay him a visit at his home.</i>

02:27:39.148 --> 02:27:42.568
<i>neri, take a train to Rome.</i>

02:27:44.195 --> 02:27:46.113
<i>Light a candle for the Archbishop.</i>

02:28:22.483 --> 02:28:25.820
Tea, Your Holiness? It will help
you sleep.

02:28:48.425 --> 02:28:51.345
This is from Vincent Corleone.

02:29:49.570 --> 02:29:54.450
It's serious. Our man inside the Vatican
says there's a plot against the Pope.

02:29:54.617 --> 02:29:56.744
He'll have a heart attack?

02:30:03.918 --> 02:30:09.131
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

02:30:11.967 --> 02:30:13.594
Let's go back.

02:30:55.678 --> 02:30:58.139
<i>Eminenza...</i>

02:31:06.105 --> 02:31:08.315
The Holy Father is dead!

02:32:38.155 --> 02:32:39.532
Sleep.

02:32:40.866 --> 02:32:43.244
Sleep, Godfather.

02:33:52.980 --> 02:33:55.065
Speak...tell me.

02:33:56.734 --> 02:34:02.448
You have lost the
faith of the people.

02:34:04.533 --> 02:34:08.412
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

02:34:08.829 --> 02:34:12.917
And Michael Corleone's message?

02:34:30.059 --> 02:34:36.148
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

02:34:40.069 --> 02:34:41.987
He's clean.

02:34:59.964 --> 02:35:03.008
Power wears out those
who don't have it.

02:36:31.555 --> 02:36:34.850
- I like this outfit.
- I figured you would.

02:36:35.017 --> 02:36:36.727
Say hello.

02:36:58.833 --> 02:37:02.670
- Can I talk to you now?
- No, it's not a good time.

02:37:02.878 --> 02:37:06.882
- You're just like my father.
- Stay with the family. Go on.

02:37:08.175 --> 02:37:09.969
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

02:37:10.136 --> 02:37:15.099
In about one minute, there will be
carabinieri all over this place.

02:37:15.266 --> 02:37:17.810
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

02:37:18.018 --> 02:37:20.479
- Got it.
- Quiet.

02:37:34.493 --> 02:37:37.580
The name Corleone
will be associated with a voice.

02:37:47.590 --> 02:37:49.216
Dad...

02:38:08.569 --> 02:38:12.072
Dad... Why are you doing this to me?

02:38:21.373 --> 02:38:24.210
Move back, move back.

02:38:24.668 --> 02:38:30.049
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Do what? What do you mean?

02:38:56.075 --> 02:38:58.160
Dad...

02:39:14.218 --> 02:39:16.929
No! Mary!

02:39:19.807 --> 02:39:21.183
God, no!

02:39:22.305 --> 02:39:28.190
