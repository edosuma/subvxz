16:34.023 --> 16:35.042
SO WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

16:35.042 --> 16:37.037
WHEN I WAS ON "SHARK TANK,"
I DIDN'T GET A DEAL.

16:37.037 --> 16:40.033
I WAS TREMENDOUSLY DISAPPOINTED,
BUT AS SOON AS I CAME BACK,

16:40.033 --> 16:42.040
I WAS WELCOMED
BY SO MUCH SUPPORT,

16:42.040 --> 16:44.012
THOUSANDS OF E-MAILS.

16:44.012 --> 16:45.053
A LOT OF INVESTORS CALLED ME

16:45.053 --> 16:48.018
AND WANTED TO OFFER CBS FOODS
A CHANCE.

16:48.018 --> 16:50.028
I EVEN GOT AN INVESTMENT BETTER
THAN I WAS ASKING FOR

16:50.028 --> 16:52.033
ON THE "SHARK TANK."

16:52.033 --> 16:54.025
BEFORE THE "SHARK TANK,"

16:54.025 --> 16:56.023
MY EARNINGS WERE
A LITTLE BIT OVER $30,000 

16:56.023 --> 16:57.042
WITH THE SHRIMP BURGER.

16:57.042 --> 16:59.010
CBS FOODS.

16:59.010 --> 17:02.018
THIS YEAR OUR PROJECTED SALES
ARE OVER $5 MILLION.

17:02.018 --> 17:03.030
WE'RE SLATED TO GO

17:03.030 --> 17:05.030
TO OVER 2,000 GROCERY STORES
ACROSS AMERICA.

17:05.030 --> 17:07.025
I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO KEEP
THE SHRIMP COMING, MAN.

17:05.030 --> 17:07.025
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.055
THE "SHARK TANK" SAVED
MY BUSINESS

17:09.055 --> 17:11.020
AND ALSO SAVED MY LIFE.

17:11.020 --> 17:12.047
I OWE THEM EVERYTHING.

17:12.047 --> 17:14.051
(ship horn honks)

17:14.051 --> 17:17.051
♪♪♪

17:24.055 --> 17:26.079
NEXT INTO THE TANK ISPAT McCARTHY,

17:26.079 --> 17:28.063
WHO IS HOPING TO ENTICETHE SHARKS

17:28.063 --> 17:30.060
WITH THEIR FAVORITE BAIT.

17:30.060 --> 17:31.083
WHOO!

17:31.083 --> 17:32.083
OH, YEAH, BABY!

17:32.083 --> 17:35.075
ALL RIGHT. MAKE IT RAIN.

17:35.075 --> 17:38.062
I LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS.

17:38.062 --> 17:39.062
HELLO, SHARKS.

17:39.062 --> 17:41.052
MY NAME IS PAT McCARTHY,

17:41.052 --> 17:43.075
AND I'M THE FOUNDER
OF LIQUID MONEY.

17:43.075 --> 17:46.063
I'M SEEKING $100,000

17:46.063 --> 17:49.058
IN EXCHANGE FOR 5%
OF MY COMPANY.

17:49.058 --> 17:55.050
WE ALL KNOW THAT SHARKS HAVE
AN AMAZING SENSE OF SMELL.

17:55.050 --> 17:59.050
IN FACT, JUST ONE DROP OF BLOOD
IN 1,000 GALLONS OF WATER

17:59.050 --> 18:01.077
CAN SEND THEM
INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE FRENZY.

18:01.077 --> 18:05.035
WELL, HUMANS ALSO CAN GET
EXCITED BY SMELL,

18:05.035 --> 18:06.070
AND THERE'S ONE SCENT
IN PARTICULAR

18:06.070 --> 18:10.040
THAT OPENS OUR GILLS
AND GETS US CIRCLING.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.040
(sniffs)

18:11.040 --> 18:12.050
THE SMELL OF MONEY, BABY.

18:12.050 --> 18:15.048
IT'S THE SMELL OF MONEY.
CAN I GET AN AMEN?

18:15.048 --> 18:16.048
AMEN.

18:15.048 --> 18:16.048
(Mark and Barbara laugh)

18:16.048 --> 18:17.070
AMEN!

18:16.048 --> 18:17.070
GOOD.

18:17.070 --> 18:20.068
AMEN!
PREACH, BROTHER. PREACH!

18:17.070 --> 18:20.068
(Robert and Kevin laugh)

18:20.068 --> 18:22.037
SO I GOT TO THINKING,

18:22.037 --> 18:25.042
IF SUCH A FRAGRANCE CAN HOLD
SO MUCH POWER,

18:25.042 --> 18:27.053
THEN WHY HASN'T ANYONE
BOTTLED IT?

18:27.053 --> 18:28.082
(mouths word)

18:27.053 --> 18:28.082
WELL, I HAVE.

18:28.082 --> 18:32.065
INTRODUCING MONEY,
THE FRAGRANCE OF SUCCESS,

18:35.077 --> 18:37.067
(sharks laugh)

18:37.067 --> 18:41.053
AVAILABLE IN TWO FORMS--
HIS MONEY AND HER MONEY.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.070
(Mark and Barbara laugh)

18:42.070 --> 18:45.073
MY FRAGRANCE IS BASED
ON THREE CORE ELEMENTS--

18:45.073 --> 18:47.077
COTTON, SILK, AND LINEN.

18:47.077 --> 18:49.082
THESE ARE
THE SAME THREE INGREDIENTS

18:49.082 --> 18:53.072
YOU FIND IN COLD, HARD CASH.

18:53.072 --> 18:56.073
FOLKS, WE KNOW
MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS,

18:56.073 --> 18:58.045
BUT WHO CARES...

18:58.045 --> 19:00.083
(chuckles)

18:58.045 --> 19:00.083
WHEN YOU CAN SMELL LIKE
A MILLION BUCKS?

19:00.083 --> 19:05.038
NOW MY MODELS ARE GOING
TO BRING YOU SOME MONEY.

19:05.038 --> 19:07.062
NOW HOW'S THAT
FOR A CHANGE OF PACE?

19:07.062 --> 19:08.062
LOVE THIS PITCH.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.062
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

19:08.062 --> 19:09.072
I LOVE IT.

19:08.062 --> 19:09.072
THANK YOU.

19:09.072 --> 19:11.037
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
THE FRAGRANCE OF SUCCESS.

19:11.037 --> 19:13.080
(sniffs) ACTUALLY IT SMELLS
PRETTY GOOD.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.077
DO YOU KNOW OWN THAT NAME?
IS IT TRADEMARKED?

19:15.077 --> 19:17.055
I DO, AND I WAS
REALLY SURPRISED,

19:17.055 --> 19:18.077
BUT I GOT IT.

19:17.055 --> 19:18.077
IN WHAT CATEGORY?

19:18.077 --> 19:21.037
FOR FRAGRANCES.

19:18.077 --> 19:21.037
REALLY?

19:21.037 --> 19:22.048
(Daymond) PAT, HAVE YOU SOLD
THIS PRODUCT ALREADY?

19:22.048 --> 19:23.067
I HAVE.

19:23.067 --> 19:24.077
WHAT ARE YOUR SALES
ANNUALLY?

19:24.077 --> 19:27.063
WELL, ANNUAL SALES ARE
$52,000, YEAR TO DATE.

19:27.063 --> 19:29.035
WHAT RETAILERS CARRY IT NOW?

19:29.035 --> 19:31.060
SO IN THE RETAIL SPACE,
I HAVE--

19:31.060 --> 19:33.050
WHICH IS ONE OF MY CHALLENGES
RIGHT NOW, KEVIN--

19:33.050 --> 19:35.042
OH, YOU'RE NOT GETTING
INTO RETAIL, PAT.

19:35.042 --> 19:37.065
I'M NOT--I'M NOT--
I-I'VE GOT--

19:37.065 --> 19:39.078
RIGHT. I'VE GOT IT
IN VERY LIMITED RETAIL.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.043
ISN'T THE TRUTH ABOUT
THIS BUSINESS,

19:41.043 --> 19:42.083
THE--ONE OF THE HIGHEST MARGIN
BUSINESSES ON EARTH,

19:42.083 --> 19:45.080
BUT LARGE BOX RETAILERS,
WHERE 90% OF THIS IS SOLD,

19:45.080 --> 19:48.037
WOULD NEVER GIVE YOU
ANY SPACE

19:48.037 --> 19:50.057
'CAUSE THEY PROTECT IT LIKE
DRUG DEALERS PROTECT THEIR TURF?

19:50.057 --> 19:51.075
NO. NO, THEY WILL GIVE HIM
THE SPACE,

19:51.075 --> 19:53.067
BUT THEY'LL GIVE HIM THE SPACE
AT $1.5 MILLION...

19:53.067 --> 19:56.038
EXACTLY.

19:53.067 --> 19:56.038
BECAUSE THE JUICE ONLY COSTS
A DOLLAR TO MAKE

19:56.038 --> 19:57.068
AND $50 TO SELL.

19:56.038 --> 19:57.068
THAT'S MY POINT.

19:57.068 --> 19:58.072
HE'S NEVER GONNA GET
ANY DISTRIBUTION.

19:58.072 --> 20:02.048
BUT I AM TALKING TO C.V.S.
RIGHT NOW.

20:02.048 --> 20:03.073
THEY ARE VERY INTERESTED.

20:03.073 --> 20:05.078
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU INVESTED
IN THIS COMPANY?

20:05.078 --> 20:09.038
SO I'VE PUT ABOUT $50,000
INTO THIS PRODUCT.

20:09.038 --> 20:10.055
(Robert) I DON'T THINK
THAT'S VERY MUCH.

20:10.055 --> 20:12.038
HOW'D YOU--HOW'D YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?

20:12.038 --> 20:14.072
SO I WENT TO AN A.T.M.

20:14.072 --> 20:17.068
THE BILLS WERE SO NEW THAT
THEY ACTUALLY STUCK TOGETHER.

20:17.068 --> 20:19.068
THEY WERE--THERE WAS
A UNIQUE FRAGRANCE TO THEM.

20:19.068 --> 20:21.080
I DIDN'T REALIZE MONEY REALLY
HAD ITS OWN UNIQUE SMELL.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.042
IT DEFINITELY DOES.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.042
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF IT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

20:24.042 --> 20:25.052
(laughs)

20:25.052 --> 20:27.073
AND THEN I READ THIS STUDY,
UH, ABOUT JAPAN,

20:27.073 --> 20:29.070
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY PUMP
THAT FRAGRANCE

20:29.070 --> 20:31.050
THROUGH THE VENTS...

20:29.070 --> 20:31.050
REALLY?

20:31.050 --> 20:32.062
TO INCREASE
WORKER PRODUCTIVITY.

20:32.062 --> 20:33.063
THEY DO IT HERE, TOO.

20:33.063 --> 20:34.078
IT'S CALLED
AMBIENT SCENTING.

20:34.078 --> 20:35.078
IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT
$100 MILLION A YEAR MARKET

20:35.078 --> 20:37.037
AND GROWING.

20:37.037 --> 20:38.077
WELL, YOU'VE DONE RESEARCH
ON THAT MARKET.

20:38.077 --> 20:41.035
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A FAR DIFFERENT
AND MORE ENTICING MARKET...

20:38.077 --> 20:41.035
MM. DEFINITELY.

20:41.035 --> 20:42.050
THAN SELLING PERFUME.

20:42.050 --> 20:46.077
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT PIPING IN
THE SCENT OF YOUR MONEY

20:46.077 --> 20:48.060
IN--IN
AN AMBIENT ENVIRONMENT?

20:48.060 --> 20:51.045
I-I HAVEN'T, BUT I HAVE BEEN
APPROACHED BY BANKS

20:51.045 --> 20:52.065
TO USE IT AS A GIFT.

20:52.065 --> 20:53.083
WHEN YOU OPEN AN ACCOUNT
WITH THE BANK,

20:53.083 --> 20:54.083
THEY ACTUALLY WILL
GIVE YOU--

20:54.083 --> 20:56.050
GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK?
(laughs)

20:56.050 --> 20:57.062
WILL GIVE YOU MONEY BACK.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

20:57.062 --> 20:58.070
PAT, THAT'S ALL GOOD,

20:58.070 --> 21:00.052
BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A PROBLEM HERE.

21:00.052 --> 21:03.058
YOU GOTTA GET HUGE DISTRIBUTION.
YOU GOTTA BUY YOUR WAY IN.

21:03.058 --> 21:04.073
THIS IS WHAT DAYMOND WAS
TALKING ABOUT.

21:04.073 --> 21:07.063
YOU NEED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,
SO...

21:07.063 --> 21:11.082
SO I PUT OUT ONE PRESS RELEASE
ON THIS PRODUCT.

21:11.082 --> 21:15.047
THIS PRODUCT EXPLODED
WORLDWIDE.

21:15.047 --> 21:17.052
IT'S IN POLAND, CROATIA,
CHINA--

21:17.052 --> 21:18.053
$50,000 IN SALES.

21:18.053 --> 21:20.067
$50,000 IN SALES IS NOT
AN EXPLOSION.

21:20.067 --> 21:21.070
IT IS IN CROATIA.

21:21.070 --> 21:22.080
UH, IT'S AN IMPLOSION.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.062
BUT IT'S
A VERY UNIQUE PRODUCT, RIGHT?

21:24.062 --> 21:26.062
THE--YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT
BECAUSE OF THE NAME,

21:26.062 --> 21:28.052
AND YOU COME BACK
BECAUSE OF THE FRAGRANCE.

21:28.052 --> 21:31.042
(Daymond) THIS BUSINESS
IS SOLELY ON ADVERTISING,

21:31.042 --> 21:33.047
AND $100,000
WILL ONLY BUY YOU

21:33.047 --> 21:36.057
ONE PAGE IN ONE OF THE BOOKS
THAT THE BIG GUYS ARE IN.

21:36.057 --> 21:39.065
PAT, HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE
LEFT TO PUT IN THIS BUSINESS?

21:39.065 --> 21:40.082
FRANKLY I DON'T--

21:40.082 --> 21:42.053
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO PUT
ANY MORE MONEY INTO IT.

21:42.053 --> 21:44.043
SO THIS IS
YOUR BIG PLAY HERE.

21:44.043 --> 21:47.040
YOU GOTTA WALK OUT OF THE TANK
WITH THE CASH IN YOUR POCKET.

21:44.043 --> 21:47.040
ABSOLUTELY.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.053
CORRECT. THIS IS IT.

21:48.053 --> 21:49.078
(Daymond)
SO WHY WOULD YOU OFFER US...

21:48.053 --> 21:49.078
THIS--

21:49.078 --> 21:51.078
5%...

21:49.078 --> 21:51.078
RIGHT.

21:51.078 --> 21:53.067
FOR $100,000?

21:53.067 --> 21:54.077
THAT MEANS YOU ARE SAYING

21:54.077 --> 21:57.078
THE VALUE OF YOUR COMPANY
IS $2 MILLION.

21:57.078 --> 22:00.037
WELL, I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO MY POINT.

22:00.037 --> 22:01.070
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A $32 BILLION MARKET.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.073
SEVEN OUT OF TEN ARE
FOR GIFTS.

22:03.073 --> 22:05.082
PAT, YOU'VE BROKE--YOU'VE BROKEN
THE CARDINAL RULE FOR ME.

22:05.082 --> 22:07.053
YEAH.

22:07.053 --> 22:09.077
WHEN SOMEONE STARTS OFF WITH,
"THE MARKET IS BILLIONS,

22:09.077 --> 22:12.053
AND IF I ONLY GET
A SMALL PERCENTAGE..."

22:09.077 --> 22:12.053
YEAH.

22:12.053 --> 22:13.062
I'LL BE OKAY."

22:13.062 --> 22:15.043
THAT'S ALWAYS A RED FLAG...

22:13.062 --> 22:15.043
RIGHT. RIGHT.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.067
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH CONFIDENCE

22:16.067 --> 22:18.062
IN YOUR PRODUCT TO DIVE
ALL-IN.

22:18.062 --> 22:19.077
NOW THAT'S NOT FAIR, MARK.

22:19.077 --> 22:21.075
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

22:19.077 --> 22:21.075
WHAT? I DON'T CARE.

22:21.075 --> 22:23.052
IF Y-YOU WANT MY MONEY,
AND YOU WANT

22:23.052 --> 22:24.072
A $2 MILLION VALUATION...

22:23.052 --> 22:24.072
RIGHT. RIGHT.

22:24.072 --> 22:27.073
AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE
ENOUGH TO SELL MONEY,

22:27.073 --> 22:29.077
THEN YOU'RE A WANT-REPRENEUR, NOT AN ENTREPRENEUR,

22:29.077 --> 22:31.063
AND FOR THAT REASON,
I'M OUT.

22:33.058 --> 22:36.048
NOW YOU SAID,
MONEY CAN'T BUY YOU HAPPINESS.

22:36.048 --> 22:37.048
I'VE BEEN RICH,
AND I'VE BEEN POOR.

22:37.048 --> 22:38.048
RIGHT.

22:38.048 --> 22:39.048
RICH IS BETTER.

22:39.048 --> 22:40.058
I AGREE.

22:40.058 --> 22:42.047
BY THE WAY,
IS THIS REAL MONEY?

22:42.047 --> 22:43.047
THAT IS REAL MONEY.

22:43.047 --> 22:44.065
WHAT?

22:43.047 --> 22:44.065
IT IS?

22:44.065 --> 22:45.073
AREN'T YOU GOING TO JAIL
FOR CHOPPING UP MONEY, PAT?

22:45.073 --> 22:47.037
WOW. THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.037
(chuckles) YEAH.

22:47.037 --> 22:48.065
YEAH, THAT'S ACTUAL
SHREDDED U.S. CURRENCY.

22:48.065 --> 22:49.075
WHERE'D YOU GET IT FROM?

22:49.075 --> 22:51.068
I BUY THAT FROM
THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY.

22:51.068 --> 22:53.048
WELL, THAT'S COOL.

22:53.048 --> 22:55.060
IS THERE A BUSINESS IN TAPING
THIS BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?

22:55.060 --> 22:56.067
(sharks laugh)

22:55.060 --> 22:56.067
(chuckles) NO, THERE ISN'T.

22:56.067 --> 22:57.077
I DON'T KNOW.

22:57.077 --> 22:59.047
NO, THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL.

22:57.077 --> 22:59.047
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

22:59.047 --> 23:01.050
LOOK, PAT, THE ONLY THING
OF VALUE I SEE IS THAT YOU--

23:01.050 --> 23:03.037
YOU'VE GOT THE NAME "MONEY"
IN THE FRAGRANCE CATEGORY.

23:03.037 --> 23:05.077
GOOD FOR YOU.
EVERYTHING ELSE IS INSANE.

23:05.077 --> 23:08.043
I LOVE MONEY.

23:08.043 --> 23:11.038
I'M EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED
WITH IT, AND IT LOVES ME, TOO,

23:11.038 --> 23:14.062
SO IT REALLY BREAKS MY HEART
TO HAVE TO SAY THIS TO YOU,

23:14.062 --> 23:16.072
BUT I'M OUT.

23:22.073 --> 23:26.068
I KNOW THAT 75% OF ALL
FRAGRANCES ARE SOLD DUTY-FREE,

23:26.068 --> 23:29.078
AND THE REST,
YOU NEED BACKING.

23:29.078 --> 23:33.042
I LIKE
THAT IDEA OF THE LICENSE...

23:34.043 --> 23:35.080
SO...

23:35.080 --> 23:39.050
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE $100,000 FOR 80%...

23:40.070 --> 23:42.073
AND I'LL GO LICENSE THE NAME,

23:42.073 --> 23:45.067
AND WE'LL MAKE A LOT
OF REAL MONEY.

23:45.067 --> 23:47.075
I-I THINK 80% IS--
IS QUITE HIGH.

23:47.075 --> 23:49.080
(Mark) JUST REMEMBER,

23:49.080 --> 23:52.068
100% OF NOTHING IS
STILL NOTHING.

23:52.068 --> 23:55.063
20% OF SOMETHING GROWING
AND BIG...

23:55.063 --> 23:58.052
HE'S OFFERING TO PUT HIMSELF
TO WORK FOR YOU

23:58.052 --> 23:59.057
AND PAY YOU TO DO IT.

23:59.057 --> 24:01.063
THAT NEVER HAPPENS.

24:02.077 --> 24:05.055
PAT, I MUST SAY, I THINK
YOUR PACKAGING IS GREAT.

24:05.055 --> 24:06.067
THANK YOU.

24:05.055 --> 24:06.067
PERFECT, OKAY?

24:06.067 --> 24:08.053
BUT THAT DOESN'T SMELL
LIKE MONEY TO ME.

24:08.053 --> 24:09.063
YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:09.063 --> 24:11.063
I GET $500 A WEEK OUT
OF THAT CASH MACHINE,

24:11.063 --> 24:13.058
'CAUSE THEY ALWAYS
GIVE IT TO ME IN NEW $50s...

24:11.063 --> 24:13.058
RIGHT. RIGHT.

24:13.058 --> 24:14.073
SO I PURPOSELY DO IT.

24:13.058 --> 24:14.073
YES.

24:14.073 --> 24:15.082
I ALWAYS SMELL THE MONEY
BEFORE I PUT IT

24:15.082 --> 24:17.038
IN MY WALLET...

24:15.082 --> 24:17.038
RIGHT.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.062
SO I REALLY KNOW
WHAT MONEY SMELLS LIKE.

24:18.062 --> 24:21.035
IT'S SUBTLE.
THIS IS NOT SUBTLE.

24:21.035 --> 24:22.045
EVEN THOUGH YOU LOOK
LIKE ROBERT REDFORD...

24:22.045 --> 24:23.045
(laughs)

24:23.045 --> 24:25.083
I'M OUT.

24:25.083 --> 24:27.073

ON THE TABLE.

24:30.060 --> 24:32.045

24:32.045 --> 24:34.038
80% OF THE COMPANY?

24:34.038 --> 24:35.040
YES.

24:36.083 --> 24:40.043
I MEAN, I REALLY WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE CONTROL OF THIS COMPANY.

24:40.043 --> 24:45.070
PAT, IT DISTURBS ME A LITTLE BIT
THAT WE HAD TO SHOW YOU

24:45.070 --> 24:48.055
THE OBVIOUS PATH,
WHICH WAS LICENSING.

24:48.055 --> 24:50.053
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
A PERFUME PRODUCT.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.050
I THINK THIS IS
A LICENSING PRODUCT.

24:52.050 --> 24:53.075
I DON'T SMELL THE MONEY.

24:53.075 --> 24:57.040
I SMELL FAILURE WITH
THE STRATEGY YOU HAVE TODAY,

24:57.040 --> 24:58.050
AND FOR THAT, I'M OUT.

25:03.070 --> 25:06.080
JUST LIKE MONEY, WHEN THERE'S
NOT ENOUGH BUYERS,

25:06.080 --> 25:08.068
MY MONEY BECOMES MORE VALUABLE,

25:08.068 --> 25:10.045
AND JUST LIKE REAL MONEY,

25:10.045 --> 25:12.083
YOU HAVE A DEPRECIATING ASSET
RIGHT NOW.

25:10.045 --> 25:12.083
RIGHT. RIGHT.

25:12.083 --> 25:14.062
SO UNLESS YOU GIVE ME
AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW,

25:14.062 --> 25:16.037
IT'S GOING UP TO 85%.

25:16.037 --> 25:18.055
(chuckles) 80%?

25:23.072 --> 25:24.077
SO, AGAIN, I THINK THAT

25:24.077 --> 25:26.058
THIS MARKET HAS
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.038
80% IS TOO MUCH.

25:29.083 --> 25:31.062
I CAN'T DO 80%.

25:31.062 --> 25:33.045
THEN I'M OUT.

25:38.077 --> 25:40.050
THERE GOES THE MONEY.

25:40.050 --> 25:41.077
(laughs)

25:41.077 --> 25:45.040
(Pat) I HAVE NO REGRETS,
TURNING DOWN DAYMOND'S OFFER.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.038
THE 80% WAS JUST OUT OF LINE.

28:09.065 --> 28:11.040
WHO'S READY?
I'M READY.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.058
THAT'S IT? YOU'RE IN?

28:11.040 --> 28:12.058
THAT'S IT?

28:12.058 --> 28:14.022
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

28:14.022 --> 28:15.055
I AM READY TO GO OUT.

28:15.055 --> 28:16.065
(Robert) OH. (laughs)

28:16.065 --> 28:17.065
(laughs)

28:17.065 --> 28:21.027
I'M OUT.

28:21.027 --> 28:22.045
SO, BARBARA,
YOU'RE REALLY OUT?

28:22.045 --> 28:24.067
YES. WOULD YOU LIKE
TO KNOW WHY?

28:22.045 --> 28:24.067
DO YOU WANT TO--

28:24.067 --> 28:26.018
DO YOU WANT TO MAKE
A SPEECH ABOUT WHY? SURE.

28:26.018 --> 28:27.067
I WOULDN'T MIND. YEAH.

28:26.018 --> 28:27.067
SURE.

28:27.067 --> 28:30.042
FIRST OFF, SITTING ON THIS
WOULD BE PAINFUL...

28:30.042 --> 28:32.027
YEP.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.027
ON THE BACK SEAT
OF YOUR PANTS.

28:32.027 --> 28:34.033
SECONDLY, I BET
THEY DON'T WASH WELL

28:34.033 --> 28:36.062
WHEN YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE
OF FORGETTING TO TAKE THEM OFF.

28:36.062 --> 28:41.027
THIRD, I THINK THE DESIGNS
ON THESE FEEL DATED TO ME.

28:41.027 --> 28:43.020
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
I LOVE THE IDEA.

28:43.020 --> 28:46.023
(Robert and Mark laugh)

28:46.023 --> 28:48.047
GUYS, WHAT DO YOU HAVE
ON YOUR TUSH?

28:48.047 --> 28:49.047
SASSY BRITCHES.

28:49.047 --> 28:50.060
SASSY BRITCHES.

28:50.060 --> 28:53.027
WOULD YOU GO ON A DATE
WEARING "SASSY BRITCHES"?

28:53.027 --> 28:55.027
UM...

28:55.027 --> 28:57.020
YOU SEE, THAT'S
THE PROBLEM, RIGHT?

28:57.020 --> 28:59.018
YOU'VE GOT YOUR CORE AUDIENCE
RIGHT HERE,

28:59.018 --> 29:00.028
BUT DO YOU THINK
IT'S GOING TO CATCH ON

29:00.028 --> 29:03.038
AND CATCH FIRE
AND LIGHTEN ALL OF AMERICA?

29:03.038 --> 29:04.052
I JUST DON'T SEE IT.

29:04.052 --> 29:06.060
WELL, KEEP IN MIND THAT
THESE PROTOTYPES ARE BULKY.

29:06.060 --> 29:09.032
I REALIZE THAT, AND THAT'S
WHY I'M HERE TODAY.

29:09.032 --> 29:11.025
I NEED THE FUNDING TO GET
TO THAT NEXT LEVEL.

29:11.025 --> 29:12.030
THERE'S OTHER PRODUCTS

29:12.030 --> 29:14.048
LIKE THIS OUT THERE.

29:12.030 --> 29:14.048
THEY DO MAKE--

29:14.048 --> 29:16.050
I HAVE NOT SEEN
ANY OTHER PRODUCTS

29:16.050 --> 29:17.065
THAT COMBINE THE LIGHTING
AND THE DESIGN.

29:17.065 --> 29:19.060
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
A BUTTON THAT GLOWS?

29:19.060 --> 29:22.050
NOT IN A-A PATCH,
WITH THE LIGHTING LIKE THIS,

29:22.050 --> 29:24.027
THAT ARE DETACHABLE
AND CAN BE REMOVED AND--

29:24.027 --> 29:25.053
BUT THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

29:25.053 --> 29:28.027
IF I WANTED TO KNOCK IT OFF,
WHY COULDN'T I JUST GO

29:28.027 --> 29:30.055
AND GET THIS MANUFACTURED
AND COMPETE WITH YOU?

29:30.055 --> 29:33.025
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
TO STOP ME FROM DOING IT.

29:33.025 --> 29:35.065
WELL, I HAVE
TWO PATENTS PENDING.

29:35.065 --> 29:37.043
AND WHAT ARE
YOUR PATENTS FOR?

29:37.043 --> 29:40.040
THE PATENTS ARE FOR
THE DETACHABLE LIGHTED DESIGN,

29:40.040 --> 29:43.023
AND THEN THE OTHER PATENT IS
FOR THE FASHION LINE

29:43.023 --> 29:44.063
THAT I CREATED, WHICH IS CALLED
TWINKLE CHEEKS.

29:44.063 --> 29:46.040
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING, KYLE?

29:46.040 --> 29:48.035
I'M A MR. MOM,
I'M AN ARTIST,

29:48.035 --> 29:49.050
AND I'M AN INVENTOR.

29:49.050 --> 29:52.027
OKAY, AND DOES YOUR WIFE
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY?

29:52.027 --> 29:54.030
MY WIFE, UH, HAS FINANCIALLY
SUPPORTED OUR FAMILY

29:54.030 --> 29:55.038
FOR 13 YEARS NOW.

29:55.038 --> 29:56.055
SHE'S WONDERFUL.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.030
SHE IS THE MOST AMAZING WOMAN
ANYBODY COULD ASK FOR.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.065
SO SHE'S BASICALLY FUNDING
YOUR GOAL TO HAVE ONE OF THESE

30:00.065 --> 30:01.065
WORK OUT FOR YOU.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.065
THAT'S RIGHT,

30:01.065 --> 30:03.060
AND I AM AT THE POINT
IN MY LIFE

30:03.060 --> 30:07.032
WHERE I JUST REALLY NEED
TO SUCCEED,

30:07.032 --> 30:09.035
SO THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE
TO WORK SO HARD.

30:09.035 --> 30:12.022
OKAY, KYLE, THIS IS NOT GOING
TO BE THE ONE THAT SUCCEEDS.

30:12.022 --> 30:13.065
I THINK YOU'VE GOT
THAT MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR.

30:13.065 --> 30:15.043
WE'VE ALL SEEN THIS.

30:15.043 --> 30:17.030
THERE'S NOTHING PROPRIETARY
ABOUT IT.

30:17.030 --> 30:18.033
I'M OUT.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.032
I GOTTA TELL YA,
BARBARA'S RIGHT.

30:22.032 --> 30:23.037
IT LOOKS DATED.

30:25.030 --> 30:26.048
I'M OUT.

30:28.035 --> 30:31.030
I'VE SEEN TEN OF THESE
IN THE LAST YEAR

30:31.030 --> 30:34.033
THAT EITHER WERE ALREADY
ON THE MARKET

30:34.033 --> 30:35.042
OR ALREADY DOING SALES.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.045
I'M OUT.

30:39.043 --> 30:41.065
KYLE,
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

30:41.065 --> 30:44.022
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES YOU FAIL.

30:44.022 --> 30:46.023
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE,

30:46.023 --> 30:49.028
THEN EVERYBODY CAN CALL YOU
AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS...

30:49.028 --> 30:50.055
(chuckles) THAT'S TRUE.

30:49.028 --> 30:50.055
SO DON'T QUIT...

30:50.055 --> 30:52.065
MM-HMM.

30:50.055 --> 30:52.065
BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN
LAUGHED AT.

30:52.065 --> 30:54.030
I KNOW I'VE BEEN LAUGHED AT,

30:54.030 --> 30:57.018
AND MY BIGGEST HITS HAVE BEEN
THE ONES PEOPLE THOUGHT

30:57.018 --> 30:58.042
WERE MOST LIKELY TO FAIL.

30:58.042 --> 30:59.042
YOU ARE...

30:59.042 --> 31:00.042
I'M OUT.

31:00.042 --> 31:02.052
OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

31:02.052 --> 31:03.052
(Daymond and Barbara)
THANK YOU.

31:02.052 --> 31:03.052
I APPRECIATE IT.

31:03.052 --> 31:05.032
GOOD LUCK, KYLE.

31:03.052 --> 31:05.032
THANK YOU.

31:08.027 --> 31:10.028

31:10.028 --> 31:11.038
I'M JUST KINDA WONDERING,
YOU KNOW,

31:11.038 --> 31:14.025
DID I MAKE THE RIGHT MOVE
IN TAKING IT HERE?

31:14.025 --> 31:16.032
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU--
YOU CAN'T LIVE LIFE LIKE THAT.

31:16.032 --> 31:18.055
YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY
AND--AND KEEP ON GOING.

31:18.055 --> 31:20.052
THAT WIFE IS INCREDIBLE.

31:20.052 --> 31:22.018
EITHER THAT
OR HE'S A GOOD DAD,

31:22.018 --> 31:23.018
AND SHE'S SMART
FOR LETTING HIM

31:23.018 --> 31:24.030
KEEP ON DOING IT.

31:23.018 --> 31:24.030
THAT'S TRUE.

31:24.030 --> 31:25.035
HE'S HOME LOOKING
AFTER THE KIDS.

31:25.035 --> 31:27.032
THAT'S THE BEST JOB
IN THE WORLD.

32:14.013 --> 32:15.040
YOU SMELL STARTED OUT
AS A CLASS PROJECT

32:15.040 --> 32:16.043
BACK IN COLLEGE.

32:16.043 --> 32:18.018
I WAS TAKING
A PACKAGE DESIGN CLASS,

32:18.018 --> 32:21.013
AND I HAD FREE REIN TO DEVELOP
ANY PRODUCT I WANTED.

32:21.013 --> 32:23.045
I WANTED TO DEVELOP SOMETHING
THAT HAD PERSONALITY,

32:23.045 --> 32:26.017

LEMON VERBENA
AND LAVENDER MINT.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.010
UM, I BROUGHT YOU ALL
SOME SAMPLES,

32:38.010 --> 32:39.027
SO YOU CAN SMELL THEM.

32:39.027 --> 32:42.040
SO LOOK AT THIS. IT SAYS,
"YOU SMELL" ON THE FRONT,

32:42.040 --> 32:44.045
AND YOU FLIP IT AROUND,
AND IT SAYS, "LEMON."

32:44.045 --> 32:46.010
YOU SMELL LIKE A LEMON,
BARBARA.

32:44.045 --> 32:46.010
(chuckles)

32:46.010 --> 32:47.028
"LIKE A LEMON."

32:46.010 --> 32:47.028
IT'S CUTE.

32:47.028 --> 32:49.027
SINCE I HAVEN'T OPENED,
UH, MY DOORS YET

32:49.027 --> 32:52.022
TO ACTUALLY HAVE A REVENUE,
I HAVE TESTED THE MARKET.

32:52.022 --> 32:53.033
I ACTUALLY TOLD
A FEW BLOGS--

32:53.033 --> 32:55.033
OH, SO YOU HAVEN'T SOLD
ANY OF YOU SMELL YET?

32:55.033 --> 32:57.035
NO, I'M STILL PRE-VENTURE,
ACTUALLY.

32:57.035 --> 33:00.013
SO YOU HAVE BARS JUST SITTING
IN A WAREHOUSE OR WHAT?

33:00.013 --> 33:02.025
NO, ACTUALLY I HAD THOSE MADE
AND ALREADY GOT RID OF THEM,

33:02.025 --> 33:04.002
SENDING THEM OUT
TO DIFFERENT COMPANIES,

33:04.002 --> 33:06.022
AND THEN ALMOST OVERNIGHT
IT ENDED UP GOING INTERNATIONAL,

33:06.022 --> 33:08.017
YOU KNOW--NEW YORK,
L.A., AND CANADA, AUSTRALIA--

33:08.017 --> 33:09.045
DID YOU SELL THEM,
OR YOU GAVE THEM AWAY?

33:09.045 --> 33:11.015
I DID SELL THEM,
'CAUSE I WANTED TO SEE

33:11.015 --> 33:13.017
HOW MUCH PEOPLE WERE WILLING
TO PAY FOR THEM.

33:13.017 --> 33:14.045
AND WHAT DID YOU LEARN?

33:13.017 --> 33:14.045
AND WHAT--YEAH.

33:14.045 --> 33:16.022
WELL, PEOPLE WERE
SELLING THEM,

33:16.022 --> 33:19.013
SURPRISINGLY,
FOR BETWEEN $7 TO $12 A BAR,

33:19.013 --> 33:21.007
BUT I ALSO FOUND THAT
THERE WERE A LOT OF COMPANIES,

33:21.007 --> 33:23.038
SOME VERY BIG NAMES,
THAT, UM, ACTUALLY WANTED IT

33:23.038 --> 33:25.027
TO BE MORE LIKE
$4.50, $5.00.

33:25.027 --> 33:26.028
SO WHAT KIND OF NAMES?

33:26.028 --> 33:28.003
WHEN YOU SAY BIG NAMES,
WHO ARE THEY?

33:28.003 --> 33:30.010
THE BIGGEST ONE WOULD BE
URBAN OUTFITTERS.

33:30.010 --> 33:32.003
THEY ASKED, YOU KNOW,

33:32.003 --> 33:33.025
HOW FAST I COULD HAVE
STUFF MADE,

33:33.025 --> 33:34.032
IN WHAT QUANTITIES,

33:34.032 --> 33:36.007
AND THEN WHAT
THE PRICE POINT WOULD BE.

33:36.007 --> 33:38.045
MEGAN, WHAT--WHAT IS THIS?
IS THIS A PAPER PRODUCT,

33:38.045 --> 33:40.010
A PAPER VERSION OF THE SOAP?

33:38.045 --> 33:40.010
YEAH, IT--IT'S ACTUALLY--

33:40.010 --> 33:41.023
IT'S PAPER SOAP,

33:41.023 --> 33:43.015
UM, SO IT'S SMALLER
THAN A LITTLE PACKET OF GUM.

33:43.015 --> 33:44.037
YOU CAN FIT IT
IN YOUR PURSE, YOUR POCKET.

33:44.037 --> 33:46.005
I'VE NEVER SEEN
THAT BEFORE.

33:46.005 --> 33:47.030
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT WOULD BE AN--YOU KNOW,

33:47.030 --> 33:48.040
AN IMPULSE BUY
AT A REGISTER.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.008
AND YOU SELL IT FOR...

33:50.008 --> 33:54.012
THE SOAP BARS ARE GOING TO BE
ROUGHLY ABOUT 80 CENTS.

33:54.012 --> 33:56.000
RETAIL, THAT WOULD BE
ABOUT $2.25.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.040
NOT BAD MARGINS.
NOT BAD MARGINS.

33:57.040 --> 33:59.008
GREAT MARGINS.
I LIKE IT.

33:59.008 --> 34:01.018
MEGAN, IF I INVEST
IN YOUR COMPANY HERE--

34:01.018 --> 34:03.035
I'M A SLAVE DRIVER, RIGHT,
AND I DEMAND A LOT,

34:03.035 --> 34:04.035
SO I'D BE INVEST--

34:03.035 --> 34:04.035
OH, MY GOODNESS.

34:04.035 --> 34:06.000
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE ME.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.008
(Mark and Barbara laugh)

34:07.008 --> 34:08.023
I'M PROBABLY
THE MOST TENACIOUS PERSON

34:08.023 --> 34:09.047
YOU'RE EVER GOING TO MEET.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.022
I MEAN,
WITH YOUR BUSINESS SKILLS

34:11.022 --> 34:14.022
AND, YOU KNOW, YOUR CONNECTIONS
AND FINANCIAL BACKING,

34:14.022 --> 34:17.003
COMBINED WITH MY TENACITY
AND MY ADDICTION TO CAFFEINE,

34:17.003 --> 34:18.003
UM, IT'S UNSTOPPABLE.

34:17.003 --> 34:18.003
(sharks laugh)

34:18.003 --> 34:19.020
ADDICTION TO CAFFEINE.

34:18.003 --> 34:19.020
(laughs)

34:19.020 --> 34:21.000
HAVE YOU PLANNED OUT WHAT YOU
WOULD DO WITH THE $50,000?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.040
IT'S ACTUALLY JUST
GOING PRIMARILY

34:22.040 --> 34:24.007
TO BUILDING THE PRODUCT.

34:24.007 --> 34:27.005
DO YOU HAVE AN ORDER FROM
SOMEBODY TO SELL IT TO THEM?

34:27.005 --> 34:28.047
UM, I-I DON'T HAVE
ACTUAL P.O.s,

34:28.047 --> 34:30.018
UM, 'CAUSE Y--I DON'T WANT
TO PROMISE SOMETHING

34:30.018 --> 34:32.033
AND THEN SOMETHING FALL THROUGH
AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT.

34:32.033 --> 34:34.027
SO, MEGAN, UM...

34:37.000 --> 34:39.022
I HAVE TO ADMIRE YOUR TENACITY,

34:39.022 --> 34:42.036
BUT THIS IS NOT REALLY
A BUSINESS I'M INTERESTED IN.

34:42.036 --> 34:44.036
I'M OUT.

34:46.047 --> 34:48.027
YOU'RE IN
A BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE MARKET.

34:48.027 --> 34:51.012
I MEAN, ANYBODY, INCLUDING ME,
IF I WANTED TO,

34:51.012 --> 34:53.033
COULD FIND A MEGAN
AND GET INTO THE SOAP BUSINESS,

34:53.033 --> 34:55.033
SO THE ONLY THING
OF VALUE HERE IS A BRAND,

34:55.033 --> 34:56.043
WHICH IS UNPROVEN YET.

34:56.043 --> 34:58.013
GOOD LUCK TO YOU,

34:58.013 --> 34:59.035
AND I'M IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR PRESENTATION,

34:59.035 --> 35:02.022
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT EASY
FOR ME TO SMELL THE MONEY.

35:02.022 --> 35:03.038
I'M OUT.

35:04.042 --> 35:06.027
(inhales deeply)

35:08.037 --> 35:12.035
ALL RIGHT, MEGAN.
I'M--I'M TEETER-TOTTERING.

35:12.035 --> 35:14.015
I MEAN, WHAT MAKES YOU
THE PERSON

35:14.015 --> 35:17.028
TO TAKE THIS
FROM CONCEPT AND DESIGN

35:17.028 --> 35:19.042
ALL THE WAY
THROUGH TO SUCCESS?

35:19.042 --> 35:22.042
UM, WELL, I GUESS
THE FIRST, UM, EXAMPLE

35:22.042 --> 35:25.025
WOULD BE THAT I DECIDED THAT
I WAS GONNA GIVE IT A GO,

35:25.025 --> 35:28.027
AND IN ABOUT A MONTH,
I HAD INTERNATIONAL PRESS.

35:28.027 --> 35:30.000
YOU KNOW, I HAD MAGAZINES
IN THE STATES.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.017
"TATLER" IN THE U.K. WROTE
ABOUT ME.

35:31.017 --> 35:32.038
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S SHORT-LIVED.

35:32.038 --> 35:35.000
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GONNA
CONTINUOUSLY GET THAT PRESS,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.015
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN
ALWAYS CONVERT IT TO SALES.

35:37.015 --> 35:38.037
WHAT--WHAT SKILLS
DO YOU HAVE

35:38.037 --> 35:40.005
THAT ARE GONNA GIVE US
CONFIDENCE,

35:40.005 --> 35:41.042
OR GIVE ME CONFIDENCE TO SAY,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:41.042 --> 35:45.022
ONCE WE GET PAST THE HYPE,
WE CAN DELIVER."

35:48.028 --> 35:50.028
UH, THERE'S NOTHING
THAT CAN STOP ME.

35:50.028 --> 35:52.012
TRUST ME.
IF YOU TEACH ME ROPES,

35:52.012 --> 35:53.012
AND YOU TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO DO,

35:53.012 --> 35:54.025
I WILL GET IT DONE,

35:54.025 --> 35:55.045
AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

35:55.045 --> 35:57.022
THAT'S WHAT GONNA BE SO GREAT
ABOUT WORKING WITH ME.

35:57.022 --> 35:58.022
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO KEEP TELLING ME

35:58.022 --> 35:59.033
OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.

35:59.033 --> 36:01.038
LIKE, I KNOW WHAT HAS
TO BE DONE, AND I DO IT.

36:01.038 --> 36:03.040
I--THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
IN MY BLOOD. (chuckles)

36:03.040 --> 36:05.000
I'M SURE YOU GUYS
UNDERSTAND IT.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.023
(laughs)

36:05.000 --> 36:06.023
I... (chuckles)

36:09.048 --> 36:11.012
SO?

36:12.037 --> 36:17.003
SO FOR $55,000 FOR 20%,

36:17.003 --> 36:18.042
WE HAVE A DEAL?

36:18.042 --> 36:21.035
NO. JUST WAIT
A MINUTE THERE.

36:24.023 --> 36:28.008
♪♪♪

36:32.013 --> 36:35.085
TWO SHARKS ARE OUT, AND MEGANHAS ONE OFFER FROM MARK.

36:35.085 --> 36:40.005
SO FOR $55,000 FOR 20%,

36:40.005 --> 36:41.093
WE HAVE A DEAL?

36:41.093 --> 36:44.088
NO. JUST WAIT
A MINUTE THERE.

36:46.090 --> 36:48.072
YOU'RE A TOTAL SURPRISE.

36:48.072 --> 36:50.068
I WROTE YOU OFF
THE MINUTE YOU WALKED IN.

36:50.068 --> 36:53.007
RIGHT AWAY, "HERE COMES
A BLONDE BOMBSHELL,"

36:53.007 --> 36:54.095
BUT THE MORE YOU TALK,
THE MORE I'M CONVINCED

36:54.095 --> 36:56.013
THAT YOU'RE
A REAL KILLER.

36:56.013 --> 36:58.007
THANK YOU. THAT MEANS A LOT
COMING FROM YOU.

36:58.007 --> 36:59.008
BUT--

36:59.008 --> 37:01.083
HERE COMES
HER BLOODSUCKING OFFER.

37:03.095 --> 37:07.068
MEGAN, LISTEN TO ME
JUST A MINUTE, ALL RIGHT?

37:07.068 --> 37:09.088
EVERY SINGLE ENTREPRENEUR

37:09.088 --> 37:13.017
THAT I'VE INVESTED IN
ON THIS SHOW IS MAKING MONEY.

37:13.017 --> 37:14.095
WHY IS THAT?

37:14.095 --> 37:18.077
BECAUSE I WORK MY BUNS OFF
MAKING SURE THEY'RE A SUCCESS.

37:18.077 --> 37:22.093
WHEN THEY CALL ME,
THEY FIND ME IMMEDIATELY.

37:22.093 --> 37:25.075
IF YOUR SOAP IS SUCCESSFUL,

37:25.075 --> 37:27.068
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE MONEY
THAN $50,000,

37:27.068 --> 37:29.002
SO YOU'RE NOT IN HERE
ASKING FOR ENOUGH.

37:29.002 --> 37:32.098
BUT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE... $55,000,

37:32.098 --> 37:35.085
BUT I MUST TAKE...

37:35.085 --> 37:38.015
40% OF YOUR BUSINESS.

37:40.077 --> 37:42.008
BECAUSE THE TRUTH
OF THE MATTER IS,

37:42.008 --> 37:44.092
I HAVE TO MAKE A RETURN,

37:44.092 --> 37:48.013
AND I ALSO NEED A DIME
FOR EVERY BAR YOU SELL.

37:52.010 --> 37:54.010
SO IF YOU'LL GIVE ME
A DIME A BAR

37:54.010 --> 37:57.075
AND YOU'LL GIVE ME 40%
OF YOUR BUSINESS FOR $55,000,

37:57.075 --> 38:00.010
I WOULD LOVE TO BE
YOUR PARTNER,

38:00.010 --> 38:03.083
AND YOU'LL JUST BE
ANOTHER SUCCESS STORY.

38:05.013 --> 38:06.095
OKAY.

38:06.095 --> 38:08.013
I'M GONNA START TO CRY.

38:06.095 --> 38:08.013
AND I'D LOVE TO HAVE
AN ANSWER NOW.

38:08.013 --> 38:09.085
I--REALLY, I'M SO MOVED.

38:08.013 --> 38:09.085
DON'T BE--YOU--

38:09.085 --> 38:11.007
OH, HUSH. (chuckles)

38:11.007 --> 38:13.092
ALL THAT WARM AND FUZZY STUFF
CAME OUT TO A BLOODSUCKING OFFER

38:13.092 --> 38:15.078
OF 40% OF YOUR COMPANY.

38:16.093 --> 38:20.098
THIS IS A NO-BRAINER.
MY OFFER IS CLEARLY BETTER.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.090
(inhales deeply and sighs)
OH, MY GOODNESS.

38:22.090 --> 38:24.073
MEGAN, I CAN SMELL
THE BLOOD IN THE WATER.

38:24.073 --> 38:27.072
YOU'VE GOT BARBARA.
YOU'VE GOT, UH, MARK CIRCLING.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.008
YOU CAN ALSO SMELL
THE LEMONS, TOO.

38:29.008 --> 38:30.070
I CAN SMELL THE LEMONS...

38:29.008 --> 38:30.070
(chuckles)

38:30.070 --> 38:32.078
AND, UH, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
I SMELL YOUR DRIVE.

38:32.078 --> 38:33.095
I DIDN'T WRITE YOU OFF.

38:33.095 --> 38:34.097
THANK YOU. (chuckles)

38:33.095 --> 38:34.097
I DON'T MAKE A JUDGMENT

38:34.097 --> 38:36.090
ON HOW PEOPLE LOOK,
UNLIKE BARBARA...

38:36.090 --> 38:39.002
(chuckles)

38:36.090 --> 38:39.002
UH...

38:39.002 --> 38:40.005
DO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN JOB?

38:40.005 --> 38:41.075
I WORK, UM, FOR MYSELF
INDEPENDENTLY

38:41.075 --> 38:42.090
AS A GRAPHIC DESIGNER.

38:42.090 --> 38:44.070
DO YOU WANT TO DO
THIS FULL-TIME?

38:44.070 --> 38:46.003
I--THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
(chuckles)

38:46.003 --> 38:47.077
I THINK IT'S
A FANTASTIC PRODUCT.

38:47.077 --> 38:48.077
I THINK IT'S
A GREAT BRAND...

38:48.077 --> 38:49.077
THANK YOU.

38:49.077 --> 38:52.070
BUT MY CONCERN IS,

38:52.070 --> 38:55.070
ARE YOU GONNA QUIT
YOUR OTHER JOB?

38:55.070 --> 38:58.070
YEAH, I-I PRETTY MUCH
ALREADY HAVE. (chuckles)

38:58.070 --> 39:00.095
WELL, PRETTY MUCH IS NOT
ALL OF IT.

39:00.095 --> 39:03.087
YES. YES. ALREADY HAVE.
IT'S SAID AND DONE. THIS IS--

39:03.087 --> 39:04.087
HOW WILL YOU--HOW WILL
YOU SUPPORT YOURSELF, THOUGH?

39:03.087 --> 39:04.087
THIS IS MY LIFE NOW.

39:04.087 --> 39:06.010
SO THIS IS 100%?

39:04.087 --> 39:06.010
I'M SORRY?

39:06.010 --> 39:07.010
HOW WILL YOU SUPPORT YOURSELF
WHEN YOU QUIT YOUR OTHER JOB?

39:07.010 --> 39:08.088
I'VE BEEN A LITTLE CHIPMUNK.

39:08.088 --> 39:12.013
I'VE BEEN STOWING THINGS AWAY
SO THAT I COULD MAKE THIS JUMP.

39:12.013 --> 39:14.068
MEGAN, LOOK, I'VE HAD
A TON OF EXPERIENCE

39:14.068 --> 39:16.013
SUPPORTING ENTREPRENEURS.

39:16.013 --> 39:19.087
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE
AN ENTREPRENEUR AND STARVE.

39:19.087 --> 39:21.070
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE ALL YOUR DREAMS

39:21.070 --> 39:23.012
JUST SITTING THERE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU,

39:23.012 --> 39:24.015
AND YOU'RE JUST
KNOWING THAT

39:24.015 --> 39:26.000
IF I JUST HAD SOMEBODY
WHO COULD HELP ME

39:26.000 --> 39:27.013
AND WHO HAD BEEN
THERE BEFORE,

39:27.013 --> 39:29.000
THEY COULD GET ME
OVER THE TOP.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.007
THAT'S WHO I AM.

39:30.007 --> 39:31.093
THAT'S WHY
I'M SITTING HERE,

39:31.093 --> 39:35.012
AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE TO GET
INVOLVED WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

39:37.012 --> 39:39.078
HERE'S WHAT I THINK
YOU NEED TO DO.

39:39.078 --> 39:41.092
I SMELL SUCCESS IN YOU.

39:41.092 --> 39:44.010
THIS IS PURELY
AN INVESTMENT IN YOU.

39:44.010 --> 39:46.092
I THINK WHAT YOU NEED IS,
YOU NEED SOME CASH FLOW

39:46.092 --> 39:48.080
TO GIVE YOU THE FREEDOM
TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.080
SHE IS SO FAR--

39:48.080 --> 39:50.097
NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU ARE SO FAR FROM DESPERATE...

39:50.097 --> 39:52.077
SO LET ME--

39:50.097 --> 39:52.077
YOU SHOULD JUST BE LAUGHING
AT THAT.

39:52.077 --> 39:55.015
NO, NO, BUT, MEGAN,
MARK ISN'T LISTENING.

39:55.015 --> 39:57.012
HE'S HEARING HALF THE STORY.

39:57.012 --> 39:59.093
I THINK WHAT THE OFFER
NEEDS TO BE IS,

39:59.093 --> 40:03.010
THE BUSINESS NEEDS
$55,000 FOR THE 20%,

40:03.010 --> 40:05.005
BUT I THINK YOU NEED
A SALARY ALONG THE WAY

40:05.005 --> 40:06.097
IN THE FIRST YEAR.

40:06.097 --> 40:09.097
YOU HAVE TAKEN THIS AND DONE
A LOT OF AMAZING THINGS.

40:09.097 --> 40:11.013
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GETTING
SO MUCH INTEREST.

40:11.013 --> 40:16.000
MY OFFER WOULD BE TO PAY YOU
THE $55,000 FOR THE 20%,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.075

40:18.075 --> 40:20.090
IN THE FIRST 12 MONTHS,
SO YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM...

40:20.090 --> 40:22.078
(chuckles)

40:20.090 --> 40:22.078
TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS

40:22.078 --> 40:24.068
AND GROW THE BUSINESS...

40:22.078 --> 40:24.068
(Kevin) YOU GUYS ARE ALL NUTS.

40:24.068 --> 40:25.072
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
I BELIEVE IN.

40:24.068 --> 40:25.072
THIS ISN'T GOLD BARS.

40:25.072 --> 40:28.075
THIS IS SOAP. THIS IS CRAZY.

40:29.088 --> 40:31.078
PICK AN OFFER.

40:34.083 --> 40:38.017
I'M GONNA EDIT MY OFFER
FOR YOU, ALL RIGHT?

40:39.075 --> 40:44.098
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $55,000
FOR THE 30%.

40:44.098 --> 40:47.000
MEGAN, BEFORE--

40:47.000 --> 40:49.002
MEGAN--

40:47.000 --> 40:49.002
WAIT. LET ME JUST ADD
SOMETHING HERE.

40:49.002 --> 40:51.077
IN THE BIG PICTURE
OF THINGS, RIGHT,

40:51.077 --> 40:52.090
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CASH.

40:52.090 --> 40:54.082
IT'S ABOUT WHO'S GONNA GIVE
YOU THE SUPPORT.

40:54.082 --> 40:57.087
I CAN MAKE AVAILABLE TIME
AND EXPERIENCE AND ACCESS

40:57.087 --> 40:58.098
TO MY OTHER COMPANIES
AS WELL.

40:58.098 --> 41:02.013
I THINK THE MONEY
IN THE FIRST YEAR IS IMPORTANT.

41:02.013 --> 41:03.072
RIGHT NOW IT'S ABOUT SURVIVAL.

41:03.072 --> 41:04.078
I THINK A LITTLE EXTRA CASH

41:04.078 --> 41:07.015
IS GONNA HELP YOU
GO ON THE RIGHT PATH,

41:07.015 --> 41:08.097
AND I BELIEVE IN YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA GET THERE.

41:08.097 --> 41:11.000
(Barbara) BUT IT'S NOT
AN IMPORTANT CARD HERE.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.017
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
AN IMPORTANT CARD HERE?

41:12.017 --> 41:14.093
THAT YOU GET LINED UP
WITH THE RIGHT DISTRIBUTOR.

41:14.093 --> 41:17.002
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
SUCCESSFUL

41:17.002 --> 41:18.070
BECAUSE OF
OTHER PEOPLE'S SUCCESS.

41:18.070 --> 41:20.075
YOU'RE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL
BECAUSE OF YOUR OWN SUCCESS.

41:20.075 --> 41:23.015
BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WOMEN WORK
HARDER, AND YOU KNOW IT.

41:23.015 --> 41:24.015
OHH.

41:23.015 --> 41:24.015
I WORK CIRCLES
AROUND THIS GUY.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.002
OH, PLEASE.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.002
OH, BOY.

41:26.002 --> 41:27.010
ABSOLUTELY.

41:26.002 --> 41:27.010
REALLY?

41:27.010 --> 41:28.087
I-I GOT HERE
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WORK?

41:28.087 --> 41:29.093
NO. WOMEN WORK HARDER
THAN MEN.

41:29.093 --> 41:31.005
(imitates violin)

41:29.093 --> 41:31.005
(chuckles)

41:31.005 --> 41:32.098
PUT ONE WOMAN AGAINST A MAN
IN ANY SITUATION...

41:32.098 --> 41:34.090
PLEASE.

41:32.098 --> 41:34.090
SHE WILL OUTWORK
THE GUY ANYTIME.

41:34.090 --> 41:35.098
GIRL POWER.

41:34.090 --> 41:35.098
YOU KNOW WHY?

41:35.098 --> 41:37.077
ALL RIGHT.
ENOUGH, ENOUGH, ENOUGH.

41:35.098 --> 41:37.077
(laughs)

41:37.077 --> 41:39.077
MEGAN, YOU GOTTA MAKE
A CALL.

41:39.077 --> 41:41.070
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

41:44.073 --> 41:47.007
I LOVE ALL THE OFFERS,
AND I LOVE ALL OF YOU GUYS.

41:47.007 --> 41:49.088
UM, BARBARA, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
YOU TO BE MY BUSINESS MOM...

41:49.088 --> 41:54.017
(chuckles) BUT STARTING OUT
THIS FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS,

41:54.017 --> 41:56.080
MONEY IS CRUCIAL.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.078
I THINK I'M GOING TO GO
WITH ROBERT'S DEAL.

41:58.078 --> 41:59.078
OHH.

41:59.078 --> 42:01.090
OH, GREAT DECISION.

42:01.090 --> 42:03.088
IS THAT A FINAL DECISION,
MEGAN?

42:03.088 --> 42:04.088
(inhales deeply)

42:04.088 --> 42:05.088
YES.

42:05.088 --> 42:07.068
I WOULD--
I WOULD THINK TWICE.

42:07.068 --> 42:09.068
I WOULD THINK TWICE
ABOUT THAT FINAL.

42:09.068 --> 42:11.012
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
(laughs)

42:11.012 --> 42:13.013
CONGRATULATIONS. GREAT JOB.

42:13.013 --> 42:15.000
YOU MADE A MISTAKE, MEGAN.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.092
(chuckles)

42:15.000 --> 42:16.092
(Kevin) ALL OF THAT,

42:16.092 --> 42:18.085
AND SHE JUST TOOK THE MONEY.

42:18.085 --> 42:20.098
IT MAKES ME FEEL
WARM AND FUZZY INSIDE.

42:18.085 --> 42:20.098
(Mark) WOW.

42:22.073 --> 42:24.005
CHOOSING BETWEEN
THOSE THREE AMAZING DEALS

42:24.005 --> 42:27.002
WAS REALLY DIFFICULT,
BUT HAVING THAT EXTRA MONEY

42:27.002 --> 42:28.085
IS REALLY WHAT HELPED TIP
THE SCALES,

42:28.085 --> 42:29.098

42:29.098 --> 42:32.012
