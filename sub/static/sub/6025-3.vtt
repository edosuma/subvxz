00:08.560 --> 00:10.280
<i>The greatness
of human accomplishment</i>

00:10.320 --> 00:12.368
<i>has always been measured by size.</i>

00:12.440 --> 00:14.283
<i>The bigger, the better.</i>

00:14.360 --> 00:15.771
<i>Until now.</i>

00:15.840 --> 00:17.524
Nanotech.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.204
Smart cars.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.884
Small is the new big.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.889
In the coming months,
Hooli will deliver Nucleus,

00:26.960 --> 00:31.363
the most sophisticated compression software
platform the world has ever seen.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.729
Because if we can make
your audio and video files smaller,

00:35.800 --> 00:41.364
we can make cancer smaller.
And hunger. And AIDS.

00:41.440 --> 00:42.521
<i>What</i> an asshole.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.204
Why would he announce it
so far ahead of the actual rollout?

00:46.280 --> 00:47.520
No one does that.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.728
He's got to be doing it
just to fuck with us, right?

00:49.800 --> 00:52.041
I actually think we're okay.
The player I gave them

00:52.120 --> 00:54.361
was from a retired
repository that was audio only.

00:54.440 --> 00:56.249
Video compression
is a completely different paradigm.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.369
What they have is like Pied Piper,
but not as good.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.171
- People will see that.
- Not if they get to market before us.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.367
Inferior products win out all the time.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.687
Like Jesus over Satan.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.648
I was going to say VHS over Beta.

01:09.720 --> 01:13.247
Okay, well, actually this is a
superior product, right here.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.970
Is it a margarita machine?

01:15.040 --> 01:16.326
It's better.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.489
My first official purchase
as CEO of Pied Piper.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.922
That's not really our logo is it?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.241
It looks like a guy sucking a dick

01:25.320 --> 01:27.846
and he's got another
dick tucked behind his ear for later.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.924
- Like a snack dick. It does.
- No, it's a Pied Piper...

01:31.000 --> 01:33.844
Here, put them on. Gilfoyle, come on.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.046
I don't want it.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.727
Jared, I bought these
t-shirts with my credit card

01:38.800 --> 01:40.689
but I think I'm close to
being maxed out, so...

01:40.760 --> 01:43.411
Yeah, we may have a little problem there.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.804
Peter Gregory's check. So?

01:45.880 --> 01:48.167
So, it's made out
to "Pied Piper incorporated,"

01:48.240 --> 01:49.924
I checked with the secretary
of state website,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.288
and there's already
a Pied Piper operating in California.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.449
So we need to change our name.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.444
- Thank God!
- Praise the dark lord, that's great news.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.046
No, it's not great news.
We love the name Pied Piper.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.605
It's a classic fairy tale.

02:02.720 --> 02:03.846
Well, I looked it up.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.890
It's about a predatory flutist
who murders children in a cave.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.964
It has all of that going for it,
Richard, and I still hate it.

02:10.039 --> 02:13.249
Richard, if we are going
to change the name, we need to do it now.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.888
Names stick. My name's only Jared because
Gavin called me that on my first day.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.411
My real name is Donald.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.051
But, Jared, we already bought the T-shirts.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.442
I can't take these back.
It was an online order.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.931
What is that atrocity?

02:26.040 --> 02:28.088
What are we, an Irish pornography company?

02:28.240 --> 02:30.641
I thought we were gonna
replace the name "Pied Piper."

02:30.720 --> 02:32.210
I thought it was a place holder.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.489
"Placeholder" would honestly be
a better name than Pied Piper.

02:36.080 --> 02:39.323
Richard, I've actually been holding off
telling people I'm the co-founder

02:39.400 --> 02:42.688
of "Pied Piper" because frankly,
it's a little embarrassing.

02:43.320 --> 02:48.611
Well, just to remind you,
you are not the co-founder.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.364
So please don't tell anyone.

02:50.480 --> 02:55.168
Richard, take Aviato. That's not a name
I found, it's a name that found me

02:55.240 --> 02:56.765
on a vision quest.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.126
Something that you should do.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.289
No, no. I'm not gonna eat a bunch of drugs
and sit out in the desert,

03:01.360 --> 03:03.522
and hope some name
randomly pops in my head.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.284
Well, then I question your leadership.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.045
Richard, a name defines a company.

03:08.120 --> 03:13.286
It has to be something primal, something
that you can scream out during intercourse.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.286
Like Aviato.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.044
Uber!

03:19.440 --> 03:22.046
Google!

03:22.120 --> 03:23.884
Hulu!

03:23.960 --> 03:27.009
Exactly, right.
Pied Piper!

03:31.960 --> 03:37.091
I'm so sorry. Your voice doesn't really reach
that register when you ejaculate, does it?

03:37.160 --> 03:40.084
No, it's just, everyone was doing it,
I was just chiming in.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.007
You guys, we can't change our name.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.447
I can't go into Peter Gregory's
office with a new name,

04:00.520 --> 04:01.881
and ask him to cut me a new check.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.321
I mean, he's pulled funding
from companies for a lot less.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.721
The Pied Piper name and trademark

04:06.800 --> 04:09.451
are registered to a sprinkler company
in Gilroy.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.642
I guess you could head out there
and talk to them.

04:11.840 --> 04:15.049
- But they may refuse...
- Okay. No, no, no. I'll negotiate with them.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.361
No offense, Richard,
but you're not a strong negotiator.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.091
- I'm a great negotiator, Dinesh.
- You're a terrible negotiator.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.083
I'm a decent negotiator.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.770
Just, so...

04:26.840 --> 04:29.127
Oh, Peter, you're here...

04:29.200 --> 04:32.363
We were supposed to meet 40 minutes ago
with the guys from Astraphile

04:32.440 --> 04:34.124
about the emergency capital injection.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.568
As we discussed,
our North Carolina plant went sideways.

04:38.640 --> 04:43.521
So we need 15 million now
or we'll have to shut down.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.645
Have any of you ever eaten at Burger King?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.365
Yes...

04:54.040 --> 04:55.041
Why?

04:55.160 --> 04:58.403
Well, I was just driven past one.

04:59.080 --> 05:02.766
And while I know their market cap
is $7 billion plus,

05:02.840 --> 05:06.401
I realize I am unfamiliar
with their offerings.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.891
Okay, fine.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.531
But what does that have to do...

05:09.760 --> 05:12.161
Is it popular among your peers?

05:12.720 --> 05:14.722
Is it enjoyed?

05:15.720 --> 05:17.643
- People seem to like it.
- Yeah, it's okay.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.327
And their selection
consists solely of these burgers,

05:21.400 --> 05:24.722
of which they are presumably king?

05:25.320 --> 05:28.164
They have other things. Chicken, fish.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.083
I'm sorry. What are we doing here?

05:31.560 --> 05:33.005
Here is what we will do.

05:33.080 --> 05:38.325
Monica, have one of the assistants
go to the nearest Burger King location

05:38.640 --> 05:40.802
and purchase one of everything.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.602
Hey, Dinesh. Dinesh.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.446
I'm on the phone with the bank and they say
they need an extra form for your payroll,

05:52.520 --> 05:53.931
because of your visa?

05:54.040 --> 05:55.371
Visa? What visa?

05:55.440 --> 05:56.601
I'm a fucking US citizen.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.610
I have Dinesh Chugtai here,
and he's pretty irate because...

06:01.480 --> 06:02.970
Oh, I see...

06:03.880 --> 06:05.928
Bertram Gilfoyle is the foreign national.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.565
Citizen of Canada.

06:08.680 --> 06:09.920
Okay, thank you.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.131
You're Canadian?

06:12.720 --> 06:14.290
Your borders are merely a construct.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.125
I prefer to think of myself
as a citizen of the world.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.443
Do you mind just sending them
the form so they know you're here legally?

06:20.520 --> 06:21.726
Yes, I mind.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.691
And also I may not be.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.681
To wit, maybe you could
make out my checks to cash?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.560
Or bitcoin.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.563
I didn't know I was
working with an illegal.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.286
The irony.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.047
Well, sometimes we do center pivot,

06:36.120 --> 06:38.771
but mainly we do lineal
like you see out there.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.806
What is it your business does again?

06:42.040 --> 06:44.566
Something to do with algebra?

06:45.840 --> 06:47.171
Algorithm, actually.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.651
It's for compression.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.891
Ultimately what we're trying to do is...

06:53.320 --> 06:55.163
You remind me of my son.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.688
He's got Asperger's, too.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.000
Oh, no, I don't...

06:59.600 --> 07:02.126
Probably all those pesticides
they put on the crops.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.049
Well, whatever it is your business does,

07:05.120 --> 07:08.488
I don't think it's going to interfere
with my irrigation company here.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.007
I'm thinking about getting in
another line of work anyway.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.521
All these foreigners coming over here,

07:14.600 --> 07:19.083
putting pieces of shit like that
all over the good farmland around here.

07:19.240 --> 07:23.006
All so people can sit around,
stare at their phones all day.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.042
Nobody jerks off to magazines anymore.

07:32.040 --> 07:36.170
Well, actually, that is a server farm.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.845
What we do, compression,

07:37.920 --> 07:41.163
would mean fewer of those,
because we'd save a lot of memory space.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.131
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.441
Well, I'm all for that, believe me.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.571
I'll tell you what.

07:48.600 --> 07:52.571
You can have the name for $1,000.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.211
How's that sound?

07:54.280 --> 07:57.284
That sounds great! Yeah, cool.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.564
Oh, tremors, too?

08:05.640 --> 08:07.051
Just like my boy.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.321
Yeah.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.526
Go for Erlich.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.450
This is Richard Hendricks,
CEO of Pied Piper.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.769
That's right. You guys said
I was a bad negotiator, but I closed it!

08:22.840 --> 08:24.888
We got a name. Tell everyone you know.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.924
Oh, all right.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.045
You don't sound that impressed.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.361
No, no, lam.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.646
I just...

08:33.080 --> 08:35.924
Now we're Pied Piper. So, later.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.046
Here you go.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.770
You must drink a lot of margaritas?

08:42.840 --> 08:45.081
We will now.
I have a startup that just got funded

08:45.160 --> 08:47.686
so this is just kind of
a gift for my guys to celebrate.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.366
Good luck with that.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.125
You'll need it, too,
when this town kicks you in the balls.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.765
- Okay. Sure.
- Let me get the door for you.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.683
I had three startups, myself,

08:56.760 --> 09:00.367
and I couldn't get those
Sand Hill Road morons to fund any of them.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.410
Cowards. My last company was genius.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.761
Have you ever been
lost in a parking lot before?

09:05.840 --> 09:09.208
See, what my app would do is
use existing AVL technology, right?

09:09.280 --> 09:13.604
So you would just type in the VIN number. And
if your car didn't have AVL capabilities

09:13.680 --> 09:16.684
you would just type in whatever section
of the parking lot you were in,

09:16.760 --> 09:19.411
like P3, or ground seven.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.324
So you just, you just write down what
section of the parking lot you're in?

09:22.400 --> 09:23.686
Why do you need an app for that?

09:23.760 --> 09:25.410
So you can remember where you parked.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.563
Right, but why don't you
just write it down on a piece of paper?

09:28.640 --> 09:30.722
Well, yeah. But this is for your phone.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.650
Okay, so it's just sorta like Notepad?

09:33.880 --> 09:36.770
- Exactly! See? You get it.
- Yeah. I get it.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.002
- Why can't all those fucking VCs?
- I don't know.

09:39.080 --> 09:40.161
Pussies, man.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.480
Oh, there we go, thanks.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.769
This is which one?

09:55.840 --> 09:57.365
The BK Double Stacker.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.005
Fascinating...

09:59.480 --> 10:05.010
Peter, I know that you are
incredibly busy with... This.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.729
But I made a personal promise
to the Astraphile guys

10:08.800 --> 10:12.566
that none of their employees would lose their
job, which will happen at midnight to...

10:12.640 --> 10:14.642
Do you see this?

10:15.200 --> 10:16.281
The Junior Whopper?

10:16.360 --> 10:19.204
No, not the sandwich.

10:20.240 --> 10:24.802
This seed atop the breading.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.211
Those are sesame seeds.

10:26.320 --> 10:30.405
A high number of these breadings
have sesame seeds on them.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.003
Billions of breadings.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.570
Sesame seeds.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.371
They only grow in certain microclimates.

10:45.200 --> 10:48.647
Peter, I know you don't want to cause

10:48.720 --> 10:51.644
173 people in North Carolina...

10:53.480 --> 10:55.244
Cicadas.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.610
- Gentlemen!
- Hey!

11:04.680 --> 11:06.842
It's our own personal Herb Cohen!

11:06.920 --> 11:08.843
- Who?
- Herb Cohen.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.605
He's a famous negotiator.
Wrote a bunch of textbooks.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.445
- No?
- What?

11:13.680 --> 11:15.842
- Have you seen the blogs?
- No.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.809
Erlich went HAM on all the tech sites.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.690
He had TechCrunch, Recode, and PandoDaily.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.285
Listen to what Kara Swisher says,

11:22.360 --> 11:25.682
"'individually, ' says Erlich Bachman,
'We are formidable.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.127
"But when you combine our portfolios,

11:28.200 --> 11:32.205
"Peter Gregory and I account
for billions of dollars in assets.

11:32.280 --> 11:35.204
"We at Pied Piper look forward
to giving Gavin Belson

11:35.280 --> 11:37.931
"and the donkeys at Nucleus
a run for their money."'

11:38.000 --> 11:39.331
What a dick.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.166
It's the guy with the name.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.010
Hello, Arnold.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.411
Cut the shit.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.562
I just read Recode.net.

11:48.640 --> 11:49.880
You read Recode?

11:49.960 --> 11:51.724
I do when my customers tell me

11:51.800 --> 11:53.802
the name of my company's
all over the Internet.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.726
But you'd probably think I'm just out here
shitting in a hole and wiping with my hand.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.484
No, no, no, I don't think you do that.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.369
Do people think you do that?
Do you do that?

12:01.440 --> 12:02.566
No, no, no!

12:02.640 --> 12:05.564
<i>I'm not falling for that phony,
mumbley-mouth,</i>

12:05.640 --> 12:07.449
<i>googly-eyed routine again.</i>

12:07.520 --> 12:09.249
<i>If you're this tech billionaire,</i>

12:09.320 --> 12:12.210
why did I give you the name
Pied Piper for next to nothing?

12:12.640 --> 12:14.085
<i>You played me.</i>

12:14.160 --> 12:17.562
You want the name,
it's going to cost you $250,000.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.769
Okay, I think you just need
to talk to the guy who said all that.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.001
And he can clear it up for you.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.811
- Where's Erlich?
- He's outside with the intern.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.247
- What intern?
- You got interns?

12:27.320 --> 12:29.721
We might as well have interns,
we hire illegal aliens.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.770
- What?
- No, no. We don't have either of those things.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.285
<i>I'll tell you what, asshole,</i>

12:34.360 --> 12:37.489
you use the name Pied Piper again,
I'm going to call my lawyer

12:37.560 --> 12:39.449
and we're gonna sue the shit out of you.

12:39.880 --> 12:44.044
- Fucking billionaires.
- Arnold? Arnold, hello?

12:44.200 --> 12:47.010
- That sounded sub-optimal.
- Yeah, it was.

12:47.800 --> 12:52.488
Hey, Jared, you know who else is Canadian?
Justin Bieber, the Hitler of music.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.320
Do you have a problem
with me being Canadian?

12:54.680 --> 12:55.966
I do, actually.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.520
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to become a citizen?

12:58.760 --> 13:00.524
Did it take you a long time?

13:00.680 --> 13:01.966
I'm glad I didn't do it then.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.125
Typical lazy immigrant.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.481
These people think they can just
walk into this country...

13:06.520 --> 13:08.363
I did just
walk into this country.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.207
My car broke down
on the Ambassador Bridge.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.568
It took me an extra 15 minutes
to get across the border. Major hassle.

13:16.560 --> 13:20.042
You know, Hitler actually
played the bassoon.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.768
So, technically, Hitler
was the Hitler of music.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.644
I don't understand.
I thought you closed the name.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.326
Well, I guess it's still a
little ajar, I don't know.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.731
Who am I, Herb Cohen?

13:32.840 --> 13:34.922
- I don't know who that is.
- Neither do I.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.327
That's a... That's a Jared thing.

13:37.440 --> 13:41.206
Hey! Make sure to clean off
all the gunk off the front bumper, okay.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.567
And since when do we have
an intern program?

13:43.640 --> 13:45.847
We don't. And when Keith finds that out,

13:45.920 --> 13:48.321
it's gonna be a valuable
business lesson for him.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.722
What? Those are the Pied Piper shirts!

13:50.800 --> 13:53.246
- Are you Richard?
- Yeah. Yes.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.809
Okay, look, I fucked up. What do we do now?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.531
Who's "we"?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.090
This morning you rudely reminded me

14:01.160 --> 14:02.650
that I wasn't a founder
of this company and now

14:02.720 --> 14:04.324
you want me to hold your hand
and help you out?

14:04.400 --> 14:05.765
I don't think so, sister.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.209
This credit card is no good.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.925
Declined.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.364
Great. Great.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.204
That stupid margarita machine maxed me out.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.965
So now the CEO of Pied Piper
can't even afford to buy lunch.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.611
Yeah, I don't think
we can use that name anymore.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.767
Dude! Dude, hey.
I owe you a big apology, man.

14:29.840 --> 14:33.401
I had no idea who you were
before and I read all this coverage

14:33.480 --> 14:36.529
about your company online,
and I was like, "Hey, Pied Piper!"

14:36.600 --> 14:37.965
"I met this dude! He came into the store"

14:38.040 --> 14:40.850
"and told me my parking app
was fucking awesome!"

14:40.920 --> 14:42.410
<i>I</i> did?

14:42.480 --> 14:44.482
Yeah, so my mom was like, "Wow, really?"

14:44.560 --> 14:46.050
"You should really pursue it!"

14:46.120 --> 14:47.804
And I was like, "Yeah, I should."

14:47.880 --> 14:49.325
The parking app?

14:49.400 --> 14:52.563
So she decides to get
a reverse mortgage on her home

14:52.640 --> 14:53.971
and write me a check.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.810
- Ooh...
- So I'm funded!

14:56.320 --> 14:57.651
Because of you, man.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.290
I was this close to giving up,
and now you gave me my dream back, man!

15:01.360 --> 15:03.488
- But“
- Oh, hey, Ron!

15:03.760 --> 15:07.162
You see this guy? This billionaire here?

15:07.240 --> 15:10.562
He's the reason why I'm quitting!

15:10.680 --> 15:14.765
- Jamie, no...
- Well, you've helped me so much,

15:14.840 --> 15:16.922
what can I do for you?

15:18.680 --> 15:23.049
Well, I need to return this machine because
I'm broke, and I need money for food.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.407
Just a quick question.

15:32.480 --> 15:37.725
Is this gonna be a cash return,
or does it credit back to the card?

15:39.880 --> 15:45.649
All right, what about "Smaller,"
spelled "S-M-L-L-R"?

15:45.720 --> 15:47.722
You know, because we make things smaller,

15:47.840 --> 15:51.367
and this would be like
a smaller version of the word "smaller."

15:51.440 --> 15:53.522
- It looks like "smeller."
- Okay.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.245
What if we spell it...

15:57.680 --> 16:00.411
"S-M-L-R?"

16:01.040 --> 16:04.442
Because that's an even smaller
version of the word "smaller."

16:04.520 --> 16:05.851
Then it looks like Smiler.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.402
We're not gonna kick the shit
out of Nucleus with Smiler.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.523
Where's Richard?
Why isn't he in here for this?

16:11.600 --> 16:14.331
I think he was out back,
wishing he'd taken the $10 million.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.564
No, I just saw him in his room,
wishing he had taken the $10 million.

16:21.320 --> 16:25.041
You know Smiler is also something
that guys call women's assholes.

16:26.560 --> 16:30.007
Richard, why aren't you in there,
coming up with new names?

16:30.080 --> 16:33.289
I don't want a new name. I want Pied Piper.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.847
But, apparently, I can't have that.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.922
So now I have to come up with a new name

16:38.000 --> 16:40.446
and take that to Peter Gregory
and ask for a new check.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.962
He's gonna pull our funding,
Gavin Belson's going to crush us,

16:44.040 --> 16:47.169
and we will be ruined
because I have no idea what I'm doing.

16:47.240 --> 16:51.006
Neither did Zuckerberg
when he was running Facebook at 19.

16:51.080 --> 16:55.244
You think he had any real-world
business experience? No. None.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.365
But he was such a tough negotiator
that now all of his friends are suing him.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.171
How awesome is that? And Steve Jobs?

17:02.240 --> 17:04.242
He took a shit-ton of hallucinogens.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.444
What a coincidence.
Maybe something that you could actually do.

17:08.119 --> 17:10.122
I'm not going on some fucking vision quest.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.160
Okay, let me get this straight,
you would rather do nothing than something?

17:13.640 --> 17:15.722
Because all the guys in the other room

17:15.800 --> 17:19.009
coming up with shitty names like,
Smallulator, are at least doing something.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.406
Fine. I'll just do it myself.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.320
I'll be back in 24 to 72 hours.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.364
Have a cold pitcher of water
and some orange slices ready for me.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.889
You know what,
I'm really gonna go for this motherfucker

17:31.960 --> 17:34.122
so you better have some
grapefruit ready, too.

17:34.880 --> 17:39.488
I'm gonna come back with a name so amazing
that Peter Gregory will write us 10 checks.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.570
What about, Dwarfism 2.0?

17:42.640 --> 17:45.325
Where's Dwarfism 1.0?

17:45.400 --> 17:46.447
Just in the world.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.601
Oh.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.806
That's prejudice.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.763
- That's hurtful.
- I'm sorry.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.451
Small, come back now, you hear?

17:53.520 --> 17:54.851
Interesting.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.848
Hey! That is not Cherry Garcia.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.164
Sorry, Gilfoyle. Company business.

18:03.680 --> 18:07.162
And who's hiding drugs?
Shocker, it's the illegal immigrant.

18:14.600 --> 18:18.207
What about Mine-imize,
like minimize but mine.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.691
Yeah.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.010
Hello, Mr. Garris.

18:27.080 --> 18:31.529
Yes, this is Richard from the company
that is rightly called Pied Piper.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.560
That's right.

18:33.640 --> 18:38.567
No, no, no. You listen to me.
Okay. We had a handshake deal.

18:38.640 --> 18:43.089
And that may not mean a lot to you,
but where I'm from, that means a whole lot.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.640
Okay, you agreed to sell me
that name for $1,000.

18:45.720 --> 18:50.362
So let me ask you this? Are you an honest
man or are you a goddamn liar?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.567
Okay. Yes, same address?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.810
Good, yeah, great. See you then.

18:58.880 --> 19:02.805
Dude, that was fucking badass.
What did he say?

19:02.880 --> 19:05.121
He said he was gonna get in his truck,

19:05.200 --> 19:07.362
drive down here
and beat the living shit out of me.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.965
Why did you say that was your address?

19:09.040 --> 19:10.690
- Say any other address.
- I don't know.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.888
He's got a very powerful voice.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.530
What are we gonna do?

19:15.040 --> 19:16.644
If you keep screaming your name,

19:16.720 --> 19:19.087
it forces the assailant
to acknowledge you as a human.

19:47.120 --> 19:51.091
It is now 5:35 PM
and I have ingested the psilocybin.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.524
I have started the countdown timer

19:53.600 --> 19:57.241
and I will be reaching
Sonora and Nirvana in approximately...

20:00.880 --> 20:02.564
Oh, fuck.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.210
Oh, shit.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.322
He's here, that's him.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.765
He came.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.640
- Should I call 911?
- No, that's a pussy move.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.722
Yeah, it's a pussy move.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.290
Just shush.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.362
Stay here until he goes away, please.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.528
I'm looking for Pied Piper.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.761
You know where it is?

20:33.840 --> 20:35.524
This is Pied Piper.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.570
No, no, no. It's a company.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.369
Like a big, big office.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.568
Do you know where that is?

20:42.640 --> 20:46.645
Yeah, it's... Here. Pied Piper.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.041
No...

20:50.280 --> 20:51.611
Hi, Arnold.

20:52.320 --> 20:56.006
I'm Richard. I'm Richard. I'm Richard.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.765
- Donald. I'm Donald.
- Richard. Richard...

20:58.840 --> 21:01.081
- Jared. I'm Jared.
- Richard, Richard, Richard.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.367
- Gilfoyle. Gilfoyle.
- My name is Richard.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.124
- Jared, Jared.
- Richard, Richard.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.760
- Gilfoyle, Gilfoyle.
- Jing Yang. Jing Yang. Jing Yang.

21:10.120 --> 21:13.886
SysBit Digital Solutions.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.249
Integrating Open Data Spaces.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.281
Yeah.

21:20.840 --> 21:24.640
TechBitData Solution Systems.

21:24.760 --> 21:29.607
Creating unique cross
platform technologies.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.803
Technologies.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.489
Technolo-Jesus.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.050
Oh, fuck!

21:39.560 --> 21:41.130
So this is Pied Piper?

21:41.200 --> 21:43.441
This is a billion dollar company?

21:43.520 --> 21:45.443
Not even close. Not yet.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.168
You pack a lot of guys in here.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.086
It reminds me
when I started Pied Piper in my garage.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.323
I kind of miss those days.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.731
Oh, yeah?

21:57.400 --> 21:59.004
I'll tell you what.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.924
$5,000 and the name is yours.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.643
Well, the thing is we agreed on $1,000.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.481
Fine, $4,000.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.530
Look, that's not the deal.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.400
- We shook on it.
- $2,000. Final offer.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.082
We could do two. That's reasonable.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.970
No, we can't do two, Jared.
It's not reasonable at all.

22:20.040 --> 22:23.169
Look, we shook hands on $1,000.
That's the deal.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.567
Okay. $1,000.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.442
But you gotta throw in some gas money.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.888
- I drove all the way out here.
- To come to kick my ass!

22:32.960 --> 22:34.371
Okay, you know what?

22:34.440 --> 22:37.728
$500! That's the deal. $500.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.684
- Fuck this.
- No, no, no, no.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.889
We don't have to...
We can keep it at the original $1,000.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.246
So, let's...

22:46.680 --> 22:50.924
- Okay, you got a deal.
- All right. Cool.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.126
We got a name!

22:52.280 --> 22:53.725
InfoTrode...

22:54.600 --> 22:57.046
Cloud-based, disruptive platforms.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.441
Disrupting the cloud through...

22:59.520 --> 23:00.885
I said cloud twice, shit.

23:00.960 --> 23:03.088
Making the world a better place

23:03.360 --> 23:08.400
through cross-platform business
facing cloud...

23:08.480 --> 23:10.608
There's that... Shit!
There's that cloud again!

23:10.680 --> 23:13.729
Info-trode, info-trode?
What the fuck is info-trode?

23:13.800 --> 23:16.929
What is that?
It's all just fucking meaningless words!

23:17.040 --> 23:18.565
Okay. No, no, no...

23:18.640 --> 23:23.640
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.129
Good-bye.

23:31.760 --> 23:35.162
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.

23:35.720 --> 23:39.281
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.169
- Making the world a better place.
- Sir?

23:41.840 --> 23:43.490
Are you okay in there?

23:43.560 --> 23:45.767
- Making the world a better place.
- He's been in there all night.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.649
I should call the sheriff.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.729
Making the world a better place.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.647
No, I... Hey, I told you
he's going to handle it!

23:52.720 --> 23:54.848
- Mr. Gregory, this is ridiculous.
- Sir...

23:54.920 --> 23:58.163
Mr. Gregory, we need an answer
and we need it now!

24:00.160 --> 24:03.130
- Yes?
- We need money. Now.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.328
And I'm sure that Burger King
and sesame seeds

24:05.400 --> 24:07.528
and whatever else you've been
mumbling about in here

24:07.600 --> 24:09.284
all seem lovely to think about...

24:09.360 --> 24:11.488
Myanmar and Brazil.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.130
No, no! No more of this!

24:13.200 --> 24:15.806
Okay, are we getting the money or not?

24:15.880 --> 24:18.884
Will you please tell us
what the hell is going on?

24:20.840 --> 24:24.003
Amusing coincidence
that two of the three countries

24:24.080 --> 24:29.211
that provide the world's sesame seeds
have such large cicada populations, no?

24:29.720 --> 24:32.769
The cicadas of Myanmar
emerge every 13 years,

24:32.840 --> 24:36.401
while the Brazilian
cicadas emerge every 17.

24:36.880 --> 24:40.566
Next year they will hatch, simultaneously,

24:40.640 --> 24:44.122
for the first time in 221 years.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.126
Crops from both countries
will be decimated.

24:48.640 --> 24:54.249
Unlike Myanmar and Brazil,
Indonesia has no cicada population.

24:54.320 --> 25:00.123
I was surprised to see Indonesian
sesame seed futures priced so low.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.530
I made a purchase.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.002
And now, if the shortage
spikes the global price

25:06.080 --> 25:09.448
even 10% we'll profit...

25:10.440 --> 25:12.761
- Evan?
- $68 million.

25:12.880 --> 25:16.089
If you wish, I could tap
that projected revenue and make you

25:16.200 --> 25:18.965
a bridge loan of $15 million, gentlemen.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.766
Unless you need more?

25:21.840 --> 25:24.207
No, that's... Thank you.
Thank you, holy shit.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.123
Yes? Happy?

25:26.360 --> 25:29.011
See? I told you he was taking care of it.

25:29.240 --> 25:33.450
And now, would anyone like some BK?

25:34.280 --> 25:36.965
Evan was kind enough
to go out and get breakfast.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.565
It's just sitting here.

25:38.680 --> 25:42.366
- Actually, we'd... I'd love some.
- Thank you so much.

25:45.720 --> 25:49.122
Is there cumin in this barbecue sauce?

25:50.960 --> 25:53.611
- I will definitely find out.
- Please do.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.841
Gentlemen, we just got back from the bank.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.968
Our first deposit slip.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.168
We are officially Pied Piper.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.884
And I am officially legal.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.964
Dinesh wouldn't shut the hell up,
so we finally went to the visa office.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.486
Took me five minutes.

26:14.560 --> 26:18.884
Took me five years. They asked me
about Al-Qaeda, like, 14 times.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.765
He literally got it while
I was still looking for parking.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.726
<i>- Hello.
- Is this Pied Piper?</i>

26:26.800 --> 26:30.566
It is now, but we're not taking
any follow-on investors at this point.

26:30.640 --> 26:35.487
<i>Investors? No, this is Kelsey
from the Arco station out on 108.</i>

26:35.560 --> 26:39.929
<i>Someone smeared your name
and number in shit on my bathroom wall.</i>

26:40.000 --> 26:43.925
- I think you may have the wrong number...
- Richie.

26:44.920 --> 26:46.206
Oh, hey, guys.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.764
Hi. Who is this?

26:49.840 --> 26:52.525
You're not gonna believe
this, but this is me.

26:52.600 --> 26:57.128
Time is a sphere and I've been reincarnated
during the same time period in which I exist.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.725
Yes, but where did he come from?

26:58.800 --> 27:01.201
From the future, obviously.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.329
Also, from a parking lot
at a gas station in Sonora.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.368
He ate the whole bag of gold caps.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.001
Awesome!

27:10.440 --> 27:14.525
Erlich...

27:19.240 --> 27:22.244
So, should I call the cops now
before anyone else does?

27:22.320 --> 27:26.086
I just got an Amber Alert
for Rogilio Núñez.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.681
Yeah, okay.
