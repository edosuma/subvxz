00:00.200 --> 00:02.368
Adult adam:
<i>In the '80s,</i>
<i>a defining moment</i>

00:02.370 --> 00:05.004
<i>For every teenage boy</i>
<i>was seeing</i>
<i>the karate kid.</i>

00:05.006 --> 00:08.173
<i>It kicked and punched</i>
<i>and swept</i>
<i>the leg of our hearts.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:11.543
<i>No one loved it more</i>
<i>than my brother barry.</i>

00:11.711 --> 00:13.746
(gong sounding)

00:13.748 --> 00:15.247
(growling)

00:15.249 --> 00:19.618
Come at me!
High block!
Cobra strike!

00:19.620 --> 00:22.287
Fake left, go right!
Ninja roll!

00:23.089 --> 00:24.957
Ah! It's okay.
I'm okay.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.759
Now throw a chop!
(karate yell)

00:26.761 --> 00:27.493
I block that chop!

00:27.495 --> 00:30.095
I retaliate!
High kick!
Fist of fury!

00:30.097 --> 00:31.830
(rhythmic panting)
oh! Oh! Oh!

00:31.832 --> 00:33.132
Death blow!
Ah!

00:33.134 --> 00:34.433
Hmm, you know,
I was thinking...

00:34.435 --> 00:37.403
It might be better
if you didn't call out
your moves first.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.537
That's a great idea.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.438
Sneak attack!
Ah!

00:39.440 --> 00:41.373
Adult adam:
<i>Sure, my big bro had</i>
<i>an inflated sense of skill,</i>

00:41.375 --> 00:44.943
<i>But in my house,</i>
<i>my mother was the one</i>
<i>who did the inflating.</i>

00:44.945 --> 00:46.678
<i>She wore something</i>
<i>we called "mom goggles."</i>

00:46.680 --> 00:50.449
<i>They made everything</i>
<i>we did not just good,</i>
<i>but spectacular.</i>

00:50.451 --> 00:53.685
Oh, look at you,
my little kung fu master!

00:53.687 --> 00:55.888
(adam groaning)
it's not kung fu. Stop!

00:55.890 --> 00:57.089
I do karate.

00:57.091 --> 00:57.856
Bilingual and dangerous?

00:57.858 --> 01:00.959
Oh, you are just
off-the-charts amazing,
honey.

01:00.961 --> 01:01.760
Oh!
Ah!

01:01.762 --> 01:03.429
Adult adam:  <i>Most kids ignore</i>
<i>their mom's high praise...</i>

01:03.431 --> 01:05.397
(school bell rings)
<i>but barry wasn't most kids.</i>

01:05.399 --> 01:07.132
<i>He really believed the hype.</i>

01:07.134 --> 01:10.335
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>that confidence</i>
<i>did not translate</i>

01:10.337 --> 01:13.138
<i>To his moves with the ladies.</i>

01:13.140 --> 01:14.406
Hi?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.808
Yo.

01:15.810 --> 01:16.909
Locker strike! Hyah!

01:16.911 --> 01:19.044
Ow! Oh...
Are you okay?

01:19.046 --> 01:21.880
I'm fine.
My hands are like rocks.

01:21.882 --> 01:24.983
But they're soft, too.
And gentle.

01:24.985 --> 01:25.684
Like baby ducks.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.319
Weird.
Man: All right, kids!

01:27.321 --> 01:28.887
That time of year again.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.890
Holiday talent show.
(laughs) eh?

01:31.892 --> 01:35.828
Nobody?
Oh, my god,
I love the talent show.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.863
Oh, do ya now?

01:39.732 --> 01:41.300
Do ya now?

01:42.235 --> 01:42.835
Weird.

01:42.837 --> 01:46.171
(chuckles) you're great.
See ya later.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.374
Adult adam:
<i>Barry had a plan in motion,</i>

01:49.376 --> 01:53.011
<i>And that night,</i>
<i>he put it into action.</i>

01:53.346 --> 01:54.079
Good evening.

01:54.081 --> 01:56.548
Glad you could all
make it tonight.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.683
What... What is this?

01:57.685 --> 01:58.450
Big announcement.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.954
I've decided to do
a karate routine
at the school talent show.

02:01.956 --> 02:02.721
Auditions are tomorrow.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.323
Now I don't want to make
too big a deal out of this,

02:04.325 --> 02:09.094
But I do believe it will be
the greatest moment
in the history of everything.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.296
Oh, my goodness!
What a wonderful idea!

02:11.298 --> 02:13.599
Murray, isn't this
a wonderful idea?

02:13.601 --> 02:16.969
If I say yes,
can I be out
of the conversation?

02:16.971 --> 02:18.003
What about you, erica?

02:18.005 --> 02:20.939
You should absolutely
do this talent thing.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.775
I've heard you singing
pat benetton in the shower.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.879
Don't worry, guys.
I'll be at
the talent show...

02:26.881 --> 02:27.579
In the front row.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.848
'cause my friends and I
always go for a good laugh.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.317
Go ahead!
Bring all your hot friends.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.452
I'll wow 'em with my moves.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.721
Now, adam,
chuck a dinner roll
at my face.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.223
Watch me deflect it.
Come on.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.926
No. No, not like that.
Gentle.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.061
And don't hit me
in the face if you can...

02:43.063 --> 02:45.063
No... What are doing?
Gently.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.032
Let me get ready, okay?
Come on.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.767
Murray: Stop it!
(yelling)

02:48.769 --> 02:50.035
Yes!
What the hell?

02:50.037 --> 02:50.969
Like lightning!
I'm like lightning!

02:50.971 --> 02:53.205
I knew you could do it!
I knew you could do it!

02:53.207 --> 02:54.373
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:54.375 --> 02:58.477
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

03:00.647 --> 03:01.580
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

03:01.582 --> 03:05.551
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

03:05.553 --> 03:07.452
Adult adam:
<i>It was December 9th,</i>
<i>1980-something,</i>

03:07.454 --> 03:11.089
<i>And barry's holiday cheer</i>
<i>was nowhere in sight.</i>

03:11.091 --> 03:13.158
(vacuum whirring loudly)

03:13.160 --> 03:14.593
(shouting inaudibly)

03:14.595 --> 03:15.694
(turns off vacuum)

03:15.696 --> 03:16.662
What's the point
of anything?

03:16.664 --> 03:17.729
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. What's wrong?

03:17.731 --> 03:20.332
I didn't get into
the talent show.
I don't understand.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.001
They rejected me.
That literally makes
no sense.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.703
Everyone who auditioned
got in but me.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.439
I hear what you're saying,
but I cannot wrap my mind
around that.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.975
Mr. Glascott said
my routine was
too inappropriate.

03:29.977 --> 03:34.279
How is being a perfect
karate angel inappropriate?

03:34.281 --> 03:37.716
Barry! Okay,
I have been thinking.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.017
Your karate routine...

03:39.019 --> 03:40.485
It needs
a professional director.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.487
That's me!
A big idea guy.

03:42.489 --> 03:45.857
Plus,
I've seen a million
karate movies.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.226
Are you crying?
(voice breaks) no.

03:47.228 --> 03:51.396
(gasps) no!
They're warrior's tears,
and it doesn't matter!

03:51.398 --> 03:52.064
The school said no!

03:52.066 --> 03:54.299
I'll never
cobra strike again!

03:54.301 --> 03:56.368
(sobbing) ugh!
This isn't fair!

03:56.370 --> 03:58.904
Adult adam:
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>there was only one thing</i>

03:58.906 --> 04:00.806
<i>Running through</i>
<i>my mom's mind.</i>

04:00.808 --> 04:01.607
(door slams shut)

04:01.609 --> 04:04.810
No one tells my baby
he can't cobra strike.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.048
Mr. Glascott!

04:10.050 --> 04:11.750
I need to speak to you
immediately.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.652
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have an important
morning meeting

04:13.654 --> 04:15.520
With the kids
from the math club.

04:15.522 --> 04:16.455
The nerds can wait.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.191
My son,
barry goldberg cannot.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.427
Are you... Beverly goldberg?

04:22.429 --> 04:23.395
Oh, yes, I am.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.797
Tell me,
what kind of educator

04:25.799 --> 04:28.667
Stomps on the dreams
of his students?

04:28.669 --> 04:30.002
Look, barry's a good kid,

04:30.004 --> 04:32.337
Which is kinda
why I discouraged him

04:32.339 --> 04:33.805
From taking part
in the show.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.141
See, some of the more
high-profile students here

04:36.143 --> 04:40.879
Can be very critical,
if you follow me.

04:40.881 --> 04:41.546
I really don't.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.615
The popular kids here
are real douche-sacks.

04:43.617 --> 04:47.119
Last year,
one kid did a
lovely ventriloquist act.

04:47.121 --> 04:52.691
The kids, well,
they did unspeakable things
to that doll after the show.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.660
Quite frankly,
it was very jarring.

04:54.662 --> 04:58.997
And barry's karate
is really ripe
for that type of ridicule.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.700
Uh, this is high school,
not  <i>"star search."</i>

05:01.702 --> 05:03.835
(chuckling) I mean,
who died and made you
ed mcmahon?

05:03.837 --> 05:06.438
Mr. Johansson,
our gym teacher.

05:06.440 --> 05:06.905
He died.

05:06.907 --> 05:10.575
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
Barry is doing that show.

05:10.577 --> 05:11.677
I will go to the top on this.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.880
I'll petition the principal,
the school board,

05:14.882 --> 05:16.415
The superintendent,
the mayor's office,

05:16.417 --> 05:20.719
The
u.S. Secretary of education
if I have to.

05:20.853 --> 05:23.155
So what's it gonna be,
andre?

05:23.289 --> 05:24.556
You know my name.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.358
I know everything.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.559
I got into the talent show!

05:27.561 --> 05:30.562
(gasps) that's good news,
and very surprising to me.

05:30.564 --> 05:34.199
Mr. Glascott said
the tri-state talent show
committee met

05:34.201 --> 05:37.202
And ruled that karate
is an art form.

05:37.204 --> 05:40.639
Wow, the tri-state
talent show committee met.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.974
You know,
that's almost unbelievable!

05:42.976 --> 05:45.310
Well, it happened,
so let's just move on.

05:45.312 --> 05:48.580
Oh, man,
we're back in business!
Let's get to work!

05:48.582 --> 05:51.316
I'll go get my nunchucks
and firecrackers.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.784
No firecrackers!

05:52.786 --> 05:54.786
So...
You threatened a teacher?

05:54.788 --> 05:58.724
Please. I just gently
suggested that
he do what I say,

05:58.726 --> 06:00.092
Or there'd be
dire consequences.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.560
Why is it you go
trotting down to the school

06:01.562 --> 06:05.497
And yell at somebody
every time one of our kids
doesn't get their way?

06:05.499 --> 06:07.432
I'm involved.
That's a good thing.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.469
You are out of control!
I had no choice, murray.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.671
Have you even
seen barry do karate?

06:12.673 --> 06:18.510
It's like a beautiful ballet,
but with punching and grunting
and rolling around.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.845
He quit after eight lessons

06:19.847 --> 06:23.382
Because he didn't want to
bike the six blocks
to get there.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.250
It hardly makes him
chuck norris.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.252
Oh, really?
Barry, get in here.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.987
What?
Your father would like
a sneak peek

06:28.989 --> 06:31.356
Of your routine
before the big show.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.324
Adam, get the firecrackers.

06:32.326 --> 06:35.494
No firecrackers!
No firecrackers.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.363

06:38.365 --> 06:38.864
Hyah!

06:38.866 --> 06:42.367
<i>♪ you got the touch</i>

06:57.785 --> 07:00.385
That's okay. I'm okay.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.654

The most deadly weapon

07:11.265 --> 07:12.531
(exhaling)

07:12.533 --> 07:15.467
Hyah!
Oh, no! A robber!

07:15.469 --> 07:18.203
Don't worry, kelly lebrock,
I'll save you!

07:18.205 --> 07:20.872
(panting) no, oh...
Don't! Ow!

07:20.874 --> 07:22.374
You're not supposed
to hit me.

07:22.376 --> 07:23.008
Disarm! Adam!

07:23.010 --> 07:27.446
(lowered voice) jeez,
you're supposed to disarm.
You're supposed to let go!

07:28.915 --> 07:31.049
He has been disarmed!

07:31.051 --> 07:33.351
And now...
The big finish.

07:33.353 --> 07:36.021
<i>♪ you got the touch</i>

07:43.363 --> 07:45.397

07:45.399 --> 07:48.767
Ah! Damn!
<i>♪ you got the touch</i>

07:49.235 --> 07:50.936
That'll break
during the show.

07:50.938 --> 07:57.142
That was the greatest thing
my eyeballs have ever,
ever seen!

07:57.144 --> 07:58.877
Do you want me to go again?
(laughing) yes!

07:58.879 --> 08:00.512
We're going again!
Yes!

08:00.514 --> 08:01.112
(murray groans)

08:01.114 --> 08:03.014
Adult adam:
<i>Turns out, not everyone</i>
<i>had mom goggles.</i>

08:03.016 --> 08:05.016
Do it again!
Do it again!

08:05.018 --> 08:08.520
Adult adam:  <i>The talent show</i>
<i>was the furthest thing</i>
<i>from erica's mind,</i>

08:08.522 --> 08:10.655
<i>But pops</i>
<i>was hoping to change that.</i>

08:10.657 --> 08:12.224
(knocking on door)

08:12.226 --> 08:13.792
Hey, kiddo,
mind if I sit down?

08:13.794 --> 08:15.126
I know
what you're gonna say,

08:15.128 --> 08:17.229
And I'm not doing
the talent show.

08:17.231 --> 08:19.297
That's not why I'm here.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.800
I came to
borrow this magazine.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.669
"eight ways
to catch a hunk."

08:24.671 --> 08:26.538
What is this garbage?

08:26.540 --> 08:28.173
But since you
brought it up...

08:28.175 --> 08:29.007
Pops, forget it!

08:29.009 --> 08:32.010
Doing the talent show
is social suicide.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.011
I might as well
go up on stage

08:33.013 --> 08:35.313
With a sign that says,
"I have lice."

08:35.315 --> 08:37.315
That doesn't sound like
much of an act.

08:37.317 --> 08:40.352
Come on, you have
an amazing voice,

08:40.354 --> 08:42.888
And you're terrific
on the guitar.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.489
You got to play the guitar.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.457
Can't. Sold it.

08:45.459 --> 08:48.059
What? You loved that guitar.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.362
And now I love
my leather jacket.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.030
That is very angering.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.598
Look, I appreciate you
believing in me

08:53.600 --> 08:56.268
And all that crap,
but there's no chance
I'm gonna do the talent show.

08:56.270 --> 09:01.740
Oh, there's a chance,
'cause I'm gonna get you
to do it.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.975
Uh, not gonna happen!

09:03.977 --> 09:05.477
We'll see!

09:05.479 --> 09:06.945
Waste of time!

09:06.947 --> 09:09.014
Can't hear you!

09:09.181 --> 09:11.082
(rhythmic exhaling)

09:11.617 --> 09:14.886
Good morning, bar.
Nice karate pajamas.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.554
It's called a gi.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.689
You need to educate yourself,
man. See more movies.

09:17.691 --> 09:21.326
Listen, I know your mom
loves this whole
<i>hong kong phooey</i> act,

09:21.328 --> 09:24.162
But haven't you considered
doing something else?

09:24.164 --> 09:25.030
Why would I ever do that?

09:25.032 --> 09:26.765
Because you're
barry goldberg,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.366
A man of many
different talents.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.503
It's true.
I am great at a lot of stuff.

09:31.505 --> 09:34.472
Skateboarding,
rapping, breakdancing.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.241
A little...

09:36.309 --> 09:38.076
Pop-and-lock action.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.679
Why are we even having
this conversation?

09:40.681 --> 09:41.947
I'm doing karate.

09:41.949 --> 09:42.948
The committee ruled
in my favor.

09:42.950 --> 09:47.152
Barry, you can't do this act.
I speak from experience.

09:47.154 --> 09:47.919
What are you talking about?

09:47.921 --> 09:51.723
When I was your age,
I was the funniest guy
on the football team.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.692
Funny?
Since when are you funny?

09:53.694 --> 09:55.694
I'm plenty funny, okay?

09:55.696 --> 09:56.561
I was hilarious.

09:56.563 --> 10:01.166
I used to tell dirty jokes,
I'd snap guys with a towel.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.334
I gave everybody
a nickname,

10:02.336 --> 10:05.270
Like, uh, pretty boy
and shorty.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.771
Those are
terrible nicknames.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.974
Shorty wasn't short.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.943
As a matter of fact,
he was a giant.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.512
Oh, my god.
Had a gland problem.

10:14.514 --> 10:15.780
Actually sad stuff.

10:15.782 --> 10:16.481
What's the point to this?

10:16.483 --> 10:19.584
The point is,
the coach said,
"murray, you're a card.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.053
"why don't you host
the pep rally?"

10:22.055 --> 10:22.887
So I did.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.556
I get up there,
I realize

10:24.558 --> 10:27.492
I've only got one minute
of material.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.326
One minute!

10:28.328 --> 10:31.329
I bombed
in front of the whole school.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.430
They threw peaches at me.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.999
Why'd they have peaches?
I don't know!

10:34.001 --> 10:35.200
They weren't even in season!

10:35.202 --> 10:39.738
All I know is,
I don't want you
to go through

10:39.740 --> 10:41.473
What I went through.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.976
Please don't do your act.
I'm begging you!

10:44.978 --> 10:46.978
So you think
I'm gonna suck?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.546
No, son.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.349
I know you're going to suck.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.251
Well, I got news for you.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.286
The audience won't
throw peaches.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.655
They'll throw flowers.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.890
And cheers! And boobs!

10:58.892 --> 11:00.825
Naked boobs! Everywhere!

11:00.827 --> 11:03.628
Just you watch.
Watch!

11:04.530 --> 11:06.264
Boobs! Naked!

11:06.266 --> 11:08.366
Adult adam:
<i>In that moment,</i>
<i>my dad realized</i>

11:08.368 --> 11:09.901
<i>He only had one way</i>
<i>to protect barry.</i>

11:09.903 --> 11:14.272
<i>He was gonna stand up</i>
<i>for his son by standing</i>
<i>in his way.</i>

11:14.274 --> 11:15.907
Mr. Glascott?

11:15.909 --> 11:17.409
We need to talk.

11:17.411 --> 11:18.410
(door closes)
I'm out again!

11:18.412 --> 11:22.013
What?
Mr. Glascott said the national
talent show committee

11:22.015 --> 11:24.416
Overruled the tri-state
talent show committee.

11:24.418 --> 11:27.786
Well, this is very surprising
and unacceptable,

11:27.788 --> 11:30.355
But they have made
their ruling,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.090
And I believe
we should honor it.

11:32.092 --> 11:36.227
The talent show
committee system in
this country's broken!

11:36.295 --> 11:37.762
Uh!

11:37.764 --> 11:38.663
National committee, huh?

11:38.665 --> 11:41.700
Well, it's more powerful
than the tri-state committee.

11:41.702 --> 11:42.300
What can I say?

11:42.302 --> 11:44.436
This is unbelievable.
You trotted down
to that school

11:44.438 --> 11:46.838
After being so judgy
with me about it?

11:46.840 --> 11:49.340
Hey, I'm just being
an involved parent.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.376
You told me
that was a good thing.

11:51.378 --> 11:51.976
Not when you do it.

11:51.978 --> 11:55.413
You got your own son
kicked out of a talent show.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.114
Who does that?

11:56.116 --> 11:57.916
Look, I'm doing
the kid a favor

11:57.918 --> 12:00.351
By not wearing
mom goggles all the time.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.953
Mom what?
Goggles!

12:01.955 --> 12:03.021
We all know you wear 'em!

12:03.023 --> 12:05.490
It makes you think
our kids are so brilliant

12:05.492 --> 12:07.726
And perfect
and poop rainbows.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.561
For once, just take
those mom goggles off

12:09.563 --> 12:11.229
And admit that
our wonderful children

12:11.231 --> 12:14.699
Are terrible
at so many
different things.

12:14.701 --> 12:15.734
I will not.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.268
They're gonna have
plenty of people

12:17.270 --> 12:18.703
Trying to tear them
down in life,

12:18.705 --> 12:19.871
So while they're
under my roof,

12:19.873 --> 12:23.074
The least I can do
is try to build them up.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.277
Accept our
children's mediocrity!

12:26.279 --> 12:27.779
It's freeing!

12:27.781 --> 12:29.414
Seriously?
I'm right here!

12:29.416 --> 12:31.950
Oh, not. Not you.
You're fantastic.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.353
Yeah,
you're a real gem
yourself.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.222
Adult adam:
<i>As the talent show drew near,</i>

12:37.224 --> 12:40.458
<i>Pops thought it was time</i>
<i>to pull out his secret weapon.</i>

12:40.460 --> 12:41.860
(banjo strumming)

12:41.862 --> 12:44.028
(pops vocalizing)

12:50.736 --> 12:54.572
Hello. I...
I didn't realize
you were here.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.108
Me, I'm just sitting here,

12:57.110 --> 12:59.677
Relaxing,
strumming the old banjo.

12:59.679 --> 13:00.812
You're wasting your strums.

13:00.814 --> 13:06.551
Am I? Or is it time
to do that duet
we used to do?

13:06.553 --> 13:07.152
(strumming)

13:07.154 --> 13:08.820
<i>♪ won't you come home,</i>
<i>bill bailey? ♪</i>

13:08.822 --> 13:10.955
(singing indistinctly)
pops. Pops!

13:10.957 --> 13:12.490
I'm not doing
the talent show.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.726
Come on!
Do this show!

13:14.728 --> 13:16.528
You can even borrow my banjo.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.796
Don't take this
the wrong way,

13:17.798 --> 13:19.364
But toting a banjo
up on stage

13:19.366 --> 13:21.699
Isn't exactly
what you'd call cool.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.602
Since when is the banjo
not cool?

13:24.604 --> 13:26.504
Since the invention
of the banjo.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.274
Erica, when you were younger,
you used to do everything...

13:29.276 --> 13:32.811
Volleyball, gymnastics,
school chorus.

13:32.813 --> 13:33.511
What happened to you?

13:33.513 --> 13:37.215
Well, I go to high school,
where people judge you.

13:37.516 --> 13:39.651
Well, if you don't think
the banjo's cool,

13:39.653 --> 13:41.719
I can always break out
the accordion.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.555
Adult adam:
<i>Turns out pops</i>
<i>wasn't the only one</i>

13:43.557 --> 13:47.125
<i>Still trying to get</i>
<i>a goldberg</i>
<i>into the talent show.</i>

13:47.127 --> 13:48.660
(sighs)

13:49.261 --> 13:51.963
<i>Or out of the talent show.</i>

13:51.965 --> 13:53.932
Man: Get out of
the way, idiot!
(car honking)

13:53.934 --> 13:54.766
What are you doing here?

13:54.768 --> 13:57.602
Stopping you from doing
what you're doing!

13:57.604 --> 14:00.738
The only thing
I'm here to do is...

14:00.740 --> 14:02.507
Fake left, go right.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.375
Pops: But isn't it
your responsibility

14:04.377 --> 14:07.679
To encourage
talented students...
Dad?

14:07.681 --> 14:10.782
Oh, hey. I... I was just
talking to mr. Glascott here

14:10.784 --> 14:14.152
About putting erica
into the talent show.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.253
I can't take this anymore.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.322
You want your kids in,
they're in.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.023
Oh, great! Which one?

14:19.025 --> 14:22.026
I don't know.
Both of them?
None of them?

14:22.028 --> 14:22.627
I really don't care!

14:22.629 --> 14:25.563
I mean, it's a stupid freakin'
high school talent show!

14:25.565 --> 14:31.169
I had one moment of weakness
where I tried to do
something kind for your son.

14:31.171 --> 14:31.836
I apologize!

14:31.838 --> 14:35.139
All I care about now
is that I owe 20 grand
in student loans,

14:35.141 --> 14:39.277
I live in a studio apartment
above a steaming hot
dry cleaner,

14:39.279 --> 14:41.713
And I have a second job
where I work as a pizza man,

14:41.715 --> 14:44.682
And occasionally
I get to deliver pizzas
to my students.

14:44.684 --> 14:48.319
Oh, also I have a parrot
that I can't get rid of.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.855
They live for 80 years.
Did you know that?

14:50.857 --> 14:51.956
Nobody tells you about that.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.259
You have to put them
in your will!

14:54.261 --> 14:55.193
It's a nightmare!

14:55.195 --> 14:57.228
So, yeah, do whatever
you want to do,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.898
'cause I really don't care!

15:00.499 --> 15:02.100
That made me
hungry for pizza.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.569
Who wants pizza?

15:05.271 --> 15:07.138
All right,
we've gathered you here

15:07.140 --> 15:09.207
Because we've got
some great news.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.175
There's been some movement
on the talent show.

15:11.177 --> 15:14.712
Again? This has been
an emotional roller coaster.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.282
Turns out barry
can do the show!

15:17.284 --> 15:19.984
Or not,
if you don't want to.

15:19.986 --> 15:20.718
What are you talking about?

15:20.720 --> 15:23.254
The national talent show
committee already ruled.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.355
It's binding.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.591
Actually, um...

15:26.759 --> 15:28.426
We're the committees.
What?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.461
Your mother took it
upon herself

15:30.463 --> 15:34.399
To trot on down
to the high school
and yell at mr. Glascott

15:34.401 --> 15:37.235
When you didn't get
into the talent show.
What?

15:37.237 --> 15:38.803
Your father trotted, too.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.439
At least I was trying
to get him into the show.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.073
Unbelievable!

15:42.075 --> 15:44.075
Why is anyone
trotting anywhere?

15:44.077 --> 15:44.909
The silver lining?

15:44.911 --> 15:47.211
Erica's in the show, too.
Excuse me?

15:47.213 --> 15:50.381
I talked to mr. Glascott.
Troubled man.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.083
But I told him
all about you.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.818
Well, you can tell him
something else.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.087
I'm not doing that show.

15:56.255 --> 15:56.854
Me, too!

15:56.856 --> 16:00.191
'cause mom meddled,
I'm not doing
that show anymore!

16:00.193 --> 16:00.658
(gasps)

16:00.660 --> 16:02.694
(exhales sharply)
and 'cause dad
doesn't believe in me,

16:02.696 --> 16:06.497
I'm gonna prove you wrong,
and I'm gonna do the show.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.666
Wait. Wh...
Which one is it?

16:08.668 --> 16:09.334
I don't know!

16:09.336 --> 16:10.935
I'm just so angry
at both of you.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.304
(whispers)
I really think
you should do it.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.139
All right.
I spoke with adam.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.409
This thing matters a lot
to a lot of people.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.544
I'm back in.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.579
Adult adam:
<i>The talent show was back on,</i>

16:21.581 --> 16:24.048
<i>And so was</i>
<i>my directorial debut!</i>

16:24.050 --> 16:26.050
(dance music playing)

16:26.052 --> 16:26.951
<i>It was only the opening act</i>

16:26.953 --> 16:29.387
<i>Of the william penn academy</i>
<i>holiday talent show,</i>

16:29.389 --> 16:33.057
<i>And barry was already</i>
<i>getting cold feet.</i>

16:33.059 --> 16:35.827
Wow. They're really good.

16:35.829 --> 16:36.928
It's gonna be
a tough act to follow.

16:36.930 --> 16:39.063
What are you worried about?
You got a black belt.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.666
That I took
from dad's bathrobe!

16:42.701 --> 16:43.935
(music ends)

16:43.937 --> 16:45.236
(cheering)

16:45.238 --> 16:47.505
(applauding)

16:47.906 --> 16:48.373
Dorks!

16:48.375 --> 16:49.941
Adult adam:
<i>In that moment,</i>
<i>barry realized</i>

16:49.943 --> 16:52.910
<i>The reason why lexy bloom</i>
<i>loved the talent show.</i>

16:52.912 --> 16:54.645
<i>Like the rest</i>
<i>of the cool crowd,</i>

16:54.647 --> 16:56.681
<i>She could bag on</i>
<i>all the idiots on stage.</i>

16:56.683 --> 16:58.649
I can't go out there!
What?

16:58.651 --> 17:01.152
I can't do it!
Dad was right.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.320
I'm gonna humiliate
myself.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.721
They're gonna

17:03.723 --> 17:06.924
Peaches? Who has peaches?
What are you talking about?

17:06.926 --> 17:08.693
I can't do it!

17:10.062 --> 17:10.828
(giggling)

17:10.830 --> 17:12.263
Adult adam:
<i>Despite pops' best efforts,</i>

17:12.265 --> 17:15.266
<i>Erica decided to not even</i>
<i>go to the talent show.</i>

17:15.268 --> 17:19.337

All right, karate kid,
you're up next.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.986
I can't go out there.
What are you talking about?
You're our closer.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.988
We gotta have a closer.

17:36.990 --> 17:37.889
Or I could just end it.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.124
Well, I'm out.
I'm in.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.427
My grandfather said you might
have a spot open for me.

17:42.429 --> 17:46.431
Well, seeing as
I don't care at all, yes.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.167
(indistinct conversations)

17:49.169 --> 17:51.602
One of the goldbergs.

17:55.874 --> 17:58.342

18:00.979 --> 18:02.380
<i>So, um...</i>
