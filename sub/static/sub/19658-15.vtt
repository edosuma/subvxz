12:51.848 --> 12:54.517
There it is! See, Sam?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.201
I told you all he wants
are the helmets.

12:56.321 --> 13:00.248
Yeah. Those helmets are gonna
help me find my father.

13:09.982 --> 13:11.878
Okay, what am I looking at?

13:15.431 --> 13:18.272
[Mantis] You've activated
a holo recording.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.824
This battle must've
taken place right here.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.997
That guy's helmet's
the same as mine.

13:23.476 --> 13:24.919
Dad!

13:31.845 --> 13:36.500
<i>Choose the wrong helmet, Thanos,
and there'll be dire consequences.</i>

13:36.648 --> 13:40.442
<i>I did not come for your pitiful
helmets and parlor tricks.</i>

13:40.576 --> 13:43.844
<i>I came for the one they protect.</i>

13:47.934 --> 13:49.939
<i>[groaning]</i>

13:53.615 --> 13:55.770
[Rocket] Well, now we know
how Wrinkles got his hands

13:55.851 --> 13:58.685
- on the Warlock Cocoon.
- What was that all about?

13:58.774 --> 14:00.351
Why was my dad
fighting the purple guy?

14:00.424 --> 14:04.675
Well, let me ask my dad, since he
and the big bad are like best buddies.

14:04.722 --> 14:07.968
Peter is lying, Sam. If you
want to find your father,

14:08.151 --> 14:10.326
find the other Centurion helmets.

14:10.615 --> 14:14.368
Just remember his
words and choose wisely.

14:21.519 --> 14:24.659
I believe I have one, Patriarch.

14:24.988 --> 14:28.375
Thank you, Mantis.
Yourloyalty will be rewarded,

14:28.506 --> 14:30.385
assuming you chose wisely.

14:33.845 --> 14:36.031
[grunts]

14:36.572 --> 14:39.558
I can feel the power! [Grunting]

14:44.260 --> 14:47.555
No! I... Aaah! [Grunting]

14:49.022 --> 14:51.921
- Did she just...
- Okay, look, don't panic.

14:52.043 --> 14:53.951
I'm sure there's a way to reverse...

15:02.484 --> 15:04.157
How could you do that to her?

15:04.185 --> 15:07.495
Clearly, she did not choose wisely.

15:08.185 --> 15:11.106
Quill was right.
All you want are the helmets.

15:11.185 --> 15:14.402
Thank you.
Better late than never.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.962
I'm done with you, old man.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.661
- No.<i> We</i> are not done.
- [Groans]

15:21.199 --> 15:25.724
Find me a helmet that won't
have dire consequences,

15:25.806 --> 15:29.789
or watch my son crumble to dust.

15:32.181 --> 15:36.297
Find the right helmet, Sam,
or I will end him with the wrong one.

15:36.439 --> 15:37.931
You would do that to your own son?

15:38.157 --> 15:40.098
Have ya <i> met</i> my dad?

15:40.446 --> 15:42.242
Okay! Stop! I...

15:42.321 --> 15:44.354
I'll try to find you
a Centurion helmet.

15:44.547 --> 15:46.262
Do better than try.

15:57.185 --> 15:58.537
Throw it over.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.070
Easy.

16:01.319 --> 16:02.549
Yes!

16:05.414 --> 16:06.746
[grunts]

16:08.170 --> 16:09.437
[grunts]

16:11.090 --> 16:13.284
[grunts, groans]

16:15.483 --> 16:18.535
You fools believe in
heroism and sacrifice,

16:18.761 --> 16:21.977
but the only thing worth
believing in is power!

16:22.048 --> 16:24.320
I will create
my own army of Centurions

16:24.387 --> 16:26.298
who will serve only me!

16:26.413 --> 16:28.770
They will be my only real sons.

16:28.832 --> 16:31.892
Then I will be the true Patriarch!

16:33.205 --> 16:35.633
Dude, why didn't you just
give him a fake helmet?

16:35.738 --> 16:38.292
I'm new to this hero stuff, okay?

16:39.552 --> 16:42.044
You knew I'd do anything
to find my dad.

16:42.339 --> 16:45.419
Quill was right. You used me.

16:45.531 --> 16:48.198
And now that you're
no longer useful to me,

16:48.288 --> 16:50.677
I'll have to make do with other allies.

16:55.107 --> 16:56.808
[Gamora] Nova Sentries.

16:57.768 --> 17:01.284
Everyone in position.
On my signal. Now!

17:01.371 --> 17:02.502
[Guardians grunting]

17:08.199 --> 17:10.066
[yelling]

17:14.866 --> 17:18.368
Quill, help Sam. We will
obtain the helmets. [Grunts]

17:18.481 --> 17:20.016
I am Groot!

17:21.231 --> 17:22.362
[Drax yells]

17:23.222 --> 17:25.134
Sure, you guys'll be fine.

17:25.219 --> 17:27.436
But I can't do anything... Oh!

17:28.520 --> 17:31.620
- [grunts]
- Without your tech.

17:31.645 --> 17:33.188
We know. What do you
think we've been doing?

17:33.389 --> 17:36.556
Oh. Making me parts!

17:36.581 --> 17:38.434
[chuckles] You do care!

17:39.333 --> 17:40.342
[groans]

17:40.394 --> 17:43.593
You know you can't beat me, Sam.
Don't make me destroy you.

17:43.628 --> 17:45.520
You have too much promise to be wasted.

17:45.555 --> 17:49.601
You wanna talk about waste? You
could've been a real father to Quill.

17:49.713 --> 17:52.401
It's sad he never had
a good dad like I did.

17:52.461 --> 17:54.042
[grunts]

17:54.208 --> 17:55.991
You are a child!

17:56.232 --> 17:58.571
You know nothing!

18:03.961 --> 18:05.516
I trusted you, J'Son.

18:05.588 --> 18:07.863
I just wanted you to
help me find my father.

18:07.889 --> 18:09.704
Why wouldn't you help me?

18:09.884 --> 18:11.187
Because you're weak.

18:11.222 --> 18:12.222
[grunts]

18:13.316 --> 18:14.683
[groans]

18:15.817 --> 18:17.584
You lost sight of your goal.

18:17.704 --> 18:20.155
You hesitated,
and it cost you victory.

18:20.277 --> 18:22.489
Your father had the same weakness,

18:22.712 --> 18:26.448
- and now you will pay the price for it.
- [grunts]

18:27.579 --> 18:30.371
Is that the "no mercy"
hesitation you were looking for?

18:30.524 --> 18:32.404
Maybe it runs in the family.

18:32.477 --> 18:37.774
You, son, are worse
than weak. You're cocky.

18:37.858 --> 18:39.497
- Aah!
- I am Groot!

18:39.571 --> 18:40.571
[yells]

18:41.694 --> 18:42.999
[yells]

18:44.806 --> 18:47.090
- [electricity arcing]
- [screaming]

18:49.534 --> 18:53.479
Well, now that the galaxy's
worst dad is taking a nap,

18:53.531 --> 18:56.599
there's one helmet for
everybody. [screaming]

18:56.711 --> 18:58.323
I am Groot.

18:58.464 --> 19:01.186
I do, too, learn!

19:03.409 --> 19:07.136
Quill, I am so sorry. I shouldn't
have trusted your father.

19:07.395 --> 19:10.594
Eh, you're not the first one
to make that mistake, kid.

19:11.976 --> 19:14.272
Pity it wasn't your only mistake.

19:14.770 --> 19:18.123
Looks like you hesitated
for the last time, son.

19:22.236 --> 19:23.656
[rumbling]

19:26.525 --> 19:28.091
Time to go, guys.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.168
[parasites chittering]

19:39.248 --> 19:41.786
Oh, come on! These things again?

19:44.914 --> 19:46.456
[chittering continues]

19:49.139 --> 19:53.000
[groans] Too weak to blast 'em.

19:53.149 --> 19:55.808
Then we will destroy
them with brute force.

19:59.194 --> 20:00.711
That was not me.

20:02.944 --> 20:06.437
- Uh, who's flying my ship?
- I am.

20:07.143 --> 20:09.229
For Quaddy!

20:16.101 --> 20:18.535
It's got a remote for
the tractor beam too.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.070
You're welcome.

20:29.048 --> 20:31.061
Yes! Technology rules!

20:31.514 --> 20:33.667
Time to use some biology,

20:33.775 --> 20:37.657
as in give this space whale
one serious case of indigestion.

20:47.483 --> 20:51.050
♪♪ Whale song bellowing...

20:54.074 --> 20:56.220
[whale song continues]

20:58.280 --> 21:01.034
So, after a lot of
consideration, we took a vote,

21:01.154 --> 21:05.366
and decided to take you on as a temporary
Guardian and help you find your dad.

21:05.450 --> 21:07.010
I recall no such vote.

21:07.117 --> 21:08.774
I am Groot!

21:08.834 --> 21:11.767
Relax. We could use the
extra Nova Force muscle.

21:11.890 --> 21:15.474
Especially if J'Son shows up
again with those other helmets.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.474
Well, that's not the only thing

21:17.520 --> 21:20.493
we could use some extra
Nova Force muscle for.

21:23.398 --> 21:26.780
I bet my dad never had to
scrape space whale barf.
