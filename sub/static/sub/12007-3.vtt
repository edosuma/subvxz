Previously on Switched at Birth...

00:01.609 --> 00:02.691
Welcome to the first class

00:02.743 --> 00:06.274
of the Midwest Institute
for the Deaf at U.M.K.C.

00:06.379 --> 00:07.045
I'm Iris.

00:07.080 --> 00:08.012
Daphne. Hi.

00:08.064 --> 00:09.981
I'm in the interpreter program.

00:09.983 --> 00:11.149
Let me help you with your coffeehouse.

00:11.184 --> 00:12.283
Help how?

00:12.319 --> 00:14.219
I can bring in money, and
I'm an interior designer.

00:14.271 --> 00:16.154
I can give your place the look you want

00:16.189 --> 00:17.155
to get it open.

00:17.157 --> 00:18.156
We don't even know each other.

00:18.328 --> 00:19.327
I'm Regina.

00:19.362 --> 00:20.361
Eric.

00:20.397 --> 00:21.312
It was her idea.

00:21.348 --> 00:23.281
Yeah, and you let her go through with it.

00:23.316 --> 00:24.949
I was going to prison.

00:25.001 --> 00:26.000
You will eat with it.

00:26.036 --> 00:26.968
You will sleep with it.

00:27.003 --> 00:28.186
You have a curfew of 7:00 P.M.

00:28.221 --> 00:30.772
I'm so sorry this turned into such a mess.

00:30.824 --> 00:32.756
I need you to leave my room.

00:32.792 --> 00:35.610
Dad, I had to beg him
to go to L.A. without me,

00:35.645 --> 00:37.912
<i>and he still could change
his mind at any minute.</i>

00:37.913 --> 00:40.070
_

00:41.651 --> 00:45.361
_

00:47.736 --> 00:49.493
_

00:50.380 --> 00:54.340
_

00:59.636 --> 01:03.454
You're in my film theory class. Right?

01:06.092 --> 01:07.041
Yeah.

01:07.077 --> 01:10.061
I used to babysit

01:10.113 --> 01:12.997
this little deaf boy

01:13.049 --> 01:15.149
in high school, so, um...

01:15.185 --> 01:17.852
I know some sign language.

01:19.072 --> 01:20.254
My name is

01:20.290 --> 01:24.826
S-k-y-e

01:24.861 --> 01:25.777
like the sky.

01:26.830 --> 01:27.745
Mm-hmm.

01:28.832 --> 01:29.881
(Phone clicks)

01:30.580 --> 01:31.602
_

01:31.651 --> 01:32.567
Emmett.

01:33.620 --> 01:34.535
You're the guy

01:34.587 --> 01:36.554
that's so into horror films,

01:36.589 --> 01:37.538
right?

01:39.542 --> 01:41.492
Hey, I'm going on a hike.

01:41.528 --> 01:42.910
Do you want to come?

01:46.683 --> 01:47.648
Ah.

01:47.684 --> 01:49.617
You're waiting for a call.

01:49.669 --> 01:51.452
Got it.

01:51.454 --> 01:52.420
No problem.

01:53.423 --> 01:55.640
Okay, well, I'll see you around.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.422 --> 02:11.038
So...

02:11.074 --> 02:14.192
What's your favorite horror film?

02:17.914 --> 02:19.881
<i>Psycho, of course.</i>

02:19.916 --> 02:21.232
That shower scene

02:21.267 --> 02:23.184
gets me every time.

02:23.186 --> 02:24.185
<i>John: That was the best</i>

02:24.237 --> 02:26.087
birthday dinner ever.

02:26.122 --> 02:28.056
Mm, it's getting harder
and harder to top myself.

02:28.091 --> 02:29.924
How many dinners has it been?

02:29.959 --> 02:32.827
Yeah, exactly what birthday is this, John?

02:32.879 --> 02:33.878
Toby: Let's see,

02:33.913 --> 02:35.630
so I'm 20,

02:35.682 --> 02:37.799
and when I was born, dad was...

02:37.834 --> 02:39.534
20 years younger.

02:39.586 --> 02:40.668
That is correct, my friend.

02:40.670 --> 02:41.719
(Giggling)

02:41.755 --> 02:42.837
It's not the miles, Toby.

02:42.889 --> 02:44.605
It's how you live them.

02:44.607 --> 02:46.691
Yes. And if ever a guy

02:46.743 --> 02:49.410
deserved to live out his
golden years in comfort,

02:49.479 --> 02:50.595
it's you.

02:50.647 --> 02:51.612
(Clears throat)

02:51.648 --> 02:52.563
(Chuckles)

02:53.616 --> 02:54.549
Where's my cake?

02:58.588 --> 02:59.587
Toby: You almost ready?

02:59.622 --> 03:01.272
Yeah, if you help me.

03:05.095 --> 03:08.096
So, how's school going?

03:08.148 --> 03:09.947
It's good.

03:09.983 --> 03:11.916
Hey, uh...

03:11.968 --> 03:16.187
I was way too hard on
you at the orientation.

03:17.273 --> 03:18.956
It's all right.

03:18.992 --> 03:23.177
Actually, I'm glad that you
yelled some sense into me,

03:23.179 --> 03:26.030
and I'm really glad that
I didn't go away to school.

03:26.082 --> 03:26.998
Yeah, me too.

03:29.719 --> 03:31.652
So we're... we're good?

03:31.688 --> 03:33.621
Yeah, we're good.

03:33.673 --> 03:35.923
If I could only get through to... hey.

03:37.861 --> 03:41.829
This many candles, we should
have a fire extinguisher nearby.

03:45.435 --> 03:47.318
You know, I texted you a few times.

03:47.353 --> 03:48.569
I never heard back.

03:50.290 --> 03:52.373
Yeah, I don't really get to use

03:52.375 --> 03:54.559
my phone on the chain gang.

03:55.645 --> 03:58.513
The rest of the time, I'm on with Emmett,

03:58.548 --> 04:01.215
trying to pretend that

04:01.251 --> 04:04.252
we're not 2,000 miles away from each other.

04:05.421 --> 04:06.487
Right.

04:06.523 --> 04:08.339
I'm so sorry.

04:08.374 --> 04:09.457
I know you are.

04:09.459 --> 04:11.342
I can't say it enough.

04:11.377 --> 04:13.427
We both know it was my choice,

04:13.463 --> 04:16.630
so I can't really be mad at you.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.382
But you are.

04:18.434 --> 04:20.635
Come on, let's just go have some fun.

04:24.524 --> 04:26.440

04:35.318 --> 04:36.617
Uh, morning. I got you

04:36.653 --> 04:39.320
a chocolate muffin from the dining hall.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.321
Thanks.

04:41.407 --> 04:43.241
Oh, and before you dive back into

04:43.293 --> 04:46.460
the ions, I wanted to ask
you if you want to play

04:46.496 --> 04:48.663
bubble soccer with me?

04:48.665 --> 04:50.364
What?

04:50.400 --> 04:52.633
It's soccer, but everyone wears

04:52.669 --> 04:58.506
these enormous, plastic-like
hamster balls around their heads

04:58.558 --> 05:00.558
as fun as that sounds,

05:00.593 --> 05:02.343
I should really study.

05:02.378 --> 05:03.344
Okay.

05:03.396 --> 05:06.230
Oh, there's a Hello
Kitty convention in town.

05:06.266 --> 05:08.266
And we can get matching tattoos.

05:08.318 --> 05:09.400
I have to pass.

05:11.187 --> 05:12.186
Okay.

05:14.574 --> 05:16.157
What is that smell?

05:20.858 --> 05:25.188

05:25.889 --> 05:27.614

05:34.389 --> 05:36.800

05:36.801 --> 05:39.025

05:39.026 --> 05:42.275
_

05:43.706 --> 05:45.909
_

05:50.280 --> 05:51.430
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:51.494 --> 05:52.393
What are you looking at?

05:52.445 --> 05:55.396
I am looking at the
U.M.K.C. course catalog.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.566
Honey, let's not become helicopter parents.

05:58.601 --> 06:01.569
Daphne is perfectly capable
of picking her own classes.

06:02.622 --> 06:04.405
Actually, I was looking at it for myself.

06:06.326 --> 06:08.242
You want to take a class at U.M.K.C.?

06:08.294 --> 06:11.295
You know, last night got me
thinking about what's next,

06:11.331 --> 06:13.331
and I never went to college

06:13.383 --> 06:14.348
because of baseball.

06:14.384 --> 06:16.133
Always thought I was missing something.

06:16.169 --> 06:17.134
Am I crazy?

06:17.170 --> 06:18.502
No, I think it's a fantastic idea.

06:18.554 --> 06:19.587
I'm so proud of you, honey.

06:19.639 --> 06:21.138
(Door opens)

06:21.174 --> 06:22.173
And the cavalry has arrived.

06:22.225 --> 06:23.257
What do you got there?

06:23.259 --> 06:24.558
Supplies.

06:24.594 --> 06:27.395
It's my weekend to keep Bay
company for her house arrest.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.313
I'm gonna need a full bag of tricks.

06:29.349 --> 06:30.314
You're a smart man.

06:30.350 --> 06:31.482
You know, I had Bay duty last weekend.

06:31.517 --> 06:34.235
By Sunday night, she was
crawling up the walls.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.237
Yeah, she was a bit testy.

06:37.273 --> 06:38.272
Define "testy."

06:38.308 --> 06:39.473
Mean as a snake.

06:39.509 --> 06:41.175
(Bay screams)

06:41.210 --> 06:42.159
I'm out.

06:42.195 --> 06:43.361
Me too. Good luck.

06:43.413 --> 06:44.578
(Door opens)

06:45.615 --> 06:47.365
- (Sighs)
- (Door closes)

06:50.670 --> 06:52.453
That was a happy scream?

06:52.455 --> 06:55.539
Oh, I would be doing a touchdown
dance if I wasn't charging

06:55.591 --> 06:56.590
this stupid thing.

06:56.626 --> 06:58.092
I just got an email

06:58.127 --> 07:00.094
from the Kansas City artists' showcase.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.429
I made the final round.

07:01.431 --> 07:02.496
Cool.

07:02.532 --> 07:03.998
What does that mean?

07:04.033 --> 07:05.066
If I win,

07:05.101 --> 07:07.385
they're gonna put one of
my pieces on City Plaza

07:07.437 --> 07:09.020
next to these really important artists.

07:09.055 --> 07:10.071
Nice.

07:10.106 --> 07:11.572
Congratulations.

07:11.574 --> 07:14.208
This is seriously the first good
thing that's happened to me in forever.

07:14.260 --> 07:16.844
I'm glad to see the
clouds are finally parting.

07:16.879 --> 07:17.912
I still have to ace the interview.

07:17.947 --> 07:19.080
The lady is coming tomorrow at 10:00.

07:19.115 --> 07:20.348
She's gonna want to see my studio.

07:20.383 --> 07:22.099
I still have a bunch of pieces
that I'm gonna have to finish.

07:22.135 --> 07:23.100
Relax.

07:23.136 --> 07:24.785
We'll make it happen.

07:24.821 --> 07:26.921
Oh! I can't wait to tell Emmett.

07:26.956 --> 07:28.622
Okay, ow.

07:35.665 --> 07:36.831
(Students chattering)

07:40.486 --> 07:41.435
(Phone vibrates)

07:42.772 --> 07:43.738
Hi.

07:43.756 --> 07:46.507
I've been looking for you.

07:46.542 --> 07:48.509
I have some news.

07:48.561 --> 07:52.346
I got picked to be the D.P.

07:52.382 --> 07:56.117
on a film that's shooting this weekend.

07:56.118 --> 07:58.735
_

07:58.736 --> 08:01.422
And the guy that's directing it

08:01.457 --> 08:04.175
has some big shot producer

08:04.210 --> 08:05.192
for a dad.

08:06.312 --> 08:07.328
So...

08:07.363 --> 08:09.063
He pulled some strings

08:09.098 --> 08:12.083
and we get to shoot in a giant sound stage

08:12.135 --> 08:14.101
on a real studio lot.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.701
_

08:17.073 --> 08:18.205
And...

08:19.258 --> 08:21.776
I got you on as a...

08:23.029 --> 08:24.350
Grip.

08:24.351 --> 08:27.515
- _
- Yeah. (Giggles)

08:30.103 --> 08:31.018
Yay!

08:32.688 --> 08:33.871
Toby: Maybe we should set out some wine

08:33.905 --> 08:35.623
and cheese or something.

08:35.658 --> 08:36.890
What are you doing?

08:36.926 --> 08:39.493
I'm getting some intel on
this woman for tomorrow.

08:41.496 --> 08:42.496
Oh, no.

08:42.532 --> 08:44.698
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:44.734 --> 08:46.367
What's the matter?

08:47.437 --> 08:50.337
The showcase is getting
funding from the N.E.A.

08:51.407 --> 08:53.240
The National Endowment for the Arts.

08:53.276 --> 08:56.210
The N.E.A isn't going to support
an artist with a criminal record.

08:56.262 --> 08:57.511
Uh... okay.

08:59.148 --> 09:00.397
What are you looking for?

09:00.433 --> 09:02.116
A copy of my application.

09:02.151 --> 09:04.118
I sent it in a few months ago.

09:05.221 --> 09:06.170
Okay.

09:09.325 --> 09:11.292
"Have you ever been convicted of a felony?"

09:12.895 --> 09:14.094
Maybe they don't have to find out.

09:18.968 --> 09:21.018
I think it's pretty safe to
say they're gonna find out.

09:35.998 --> 09:36.997
Hey.

09:37.049 --> 09:38.882
I see you got my message
about the church drive.

09:39.717 --> 09:41.067
What do you got for me?

09:45.040 --> 09:45.989
Oh.

09:47.176 --> 09:48.342
There's some nice clothes in here.

09:51.046 --> 09:52.162
Yeah.

09:52.268 --> 09:54.184
He had good taste.

09:54.186 --> 09:56.987
And he looked damn good
in whatever he wore.

09:57.022 --> 09:58.288
He did.

10:01.026 --> 10:03.026
Sometimes I dream he's asleep next to me.

10:04.847 --> 10:06.163
Oh, sweetie.

10:06.198 --> 10:08.982
What I wouldn't give for
one last roll in the hay.

10:09.018 --> 10:10.701
(Laughs) Okay.

10:10.753 --> 10:13.003
Is it wrong for me to say that?

10:13.072 --> 10:15.722
I mean, it's just been so long.

10:15.774 --> 10:16.974
Of course not.

10:16.976 --> 10:18.792
But, you know, to be honest,

10:18.827 --> 10:20.811
when you told me about the Hawaii offer,

10:20.846 --> 10:22.796
I just assumed that you
and Wes were, you know...

10:22.848 --> 10:23.981
No!

10:24.984 --> 10:27.818
We kissed, but that's it.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.701
It was just too soon.

10:30.788 --> 10:32.854
Look, Regina...

10:32.890 --> 10:35.657
You don't have to give away
Angelo's things right now.

10:35.693 --> 10:37.576
If you're not ready, you're not ready.

10:38.762 --> 10:40.629
No, I should.

10:40.664 --> 10:42.531
It's time.

11:01.218 --> 11:03.235
How cool is this?

11:04.271 --> 11:05.320
Yeah, I got her now.

11:05.372 --> 11:07.239
Skye, we need you at camera
to line up first shot.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.207
Okay, I got to go.

11:15.883 --> 11:16.999
Watch your back.

11:19.937 --> 11:21.770
I said watch your back.

11:23.741 --> 11:24.740
Skye: Hey, come on.

11:24.742 --> 11:26.675
There's someone I want you to meet.

11:34.376 --> 11:37.261

11:37.262 --> 11:38.816

11:39.123 --> 11:40.689
Oh, oh, wait! You're closing it?

11:40.708 --> 11:42.624
Some idiot put a cherry bomb in the toilet.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.792
The whole plumbing system's shot.

11:43.794 --> 11:45.594
How long will that take to fix?

11:45.596 --> 11:47.729
I don't know. Maybe six weeks.

11:47.731 --> 11:49.498
Six weeks?

11:49.533 --> 11:51.366
Well, there's a bathroom at
the other end of the floor.

11:51.368 --> 11:53.168
One bathroom for 40 kids?

11:53.220 --> 11:54.419
That's never gonna work.

11:54.471 --> 11:56.471
Complain to whoever
cherry bombed your toilet.

12:52.431 --> 12:54.696
Hey, Taylor. Uh, this is my friend Emmett...

12:54.698 --> 12:55.697
Why'd you choose the 50?

12:55.749 --> 12:57.466
It's perfect for the shot.

12:57.468 --> 12:59.468
What about the 24?

12:59.470 --> 13:02.571
That lens is too wide. Her face
will look all fat and puffy.

13:02.606 --> 13:04.539
I don't care how she looks.

13:04.541 --> 13:06.208
Fincher does it all the time.

13:06.210 --> 13:07.509
It's about the dominance
of the protagonist,

13:07.544 --> 13:09.311
not some actor looking good.

13:10.347 --> 13:11.496
Well, still, compositionally...

13:11.532 --> 13:12.447
I'm going with the wide.

13:13.884 --> 13:16.218
That is, unless you want to waste
more of my time arguing with me.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.385
No. Got it.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.354
Um, I'll get the 24 on right away.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.040
Who are you?

13:22.075 --> 13:23.058
This is Emmett.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.176
He's in school with us

13:24.211 --> 13:25.927
and he's gonna help us
out in the grip department.

13:29.565 --> 13:34.435
_

13:36.441 --> 13:38.840
He says thanks for having him. He's deaf.

13:38.876 --> 13:40.158
Oh.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.793
Cool.

13:41.829 --> 13:43.979
You know, we're all good with grips,

13:44.014 --> 13:45.814
but I could use someone in craft service.

13:45.816 --> 13:46.865
Put him there.

13:46.900 --> 13:47.983
Taylor...

13:48.018 --> 13:49.751
Assistant director: First
team rehearsal everybody.

13:49.803 --> 13:51.670
(Bell rings)

13:52.673 --> 13:54.473
I'm so sorry.

13:54.525 --> 13:55.724
Um, I'll talk to him.

13:56.625 --> 14:02.349
_

14:02.733 --> 14:04.349
Okay.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.406
<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

14:12.576 --> 14:13.525
She's here!

14:18.298 --> 14:20.315
This is an abomination.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.400
It cost me three bucks.

14:22.436 --> 14:24.186
It's the best I could do on short notice.

14:24.221 --> 14:25.487
And it covers the anklet.

14:27.207 --> 14:29.007
Is this really wrong? I hate to lie to her.

14:29.059 --> 14:30.025
You're not lying.

14:30.060 --> 14:31.226
Technically, you're innocent.

14:36.216 --> 14:37.966
Ms. Berdick, I presume?

14:45.843 --> 14:46.842
Are you Mingo?

14:46.894 --> 14:47.843
I am.

14:47.895 --> 14:48.894
What can I do for you?

14:48.946 --> 14:49.978
You can start by apologizing

14:49.980 --> 14:51.913
for blowing up our bathroom.

14:51.949 --> 14:52.881
Damn.

14:52.916 --> 14:55.834
Forensic evidence, huh?

14:55.886 --> 14:58.520
What are you, a criminology major?

14:58.522 --> 14:59.821
Oh, so you admit that you did it.

14:59.873 --> 15:00.822
No.

15:00.824 --> 15:01.957
Those pictures don't prove anything.

15:01.992 --> 15:02.924
Oh, I think the Dean's office

15:02.960 --> 15:04.426
will feel differently.

15:04.428 --> 15:05.594
I'm sure they're gonna want to know why

15:05.596 --> 15:06.761
you've been persecuting the new, deaf kids.

15:06.813 --> 15:08.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.531
You're deaf?

15:09.566 --> 15:10.832
Ugh.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.417
Hey, come on.

15:12.469 --> 15:14.336
Getting hazed is all
part of the experience.

15:14.388 --> 15:15.604
You wouldn't want me
to treat you differently

15:15.639 --> 15:16.688
than the other freshmen, would you?

15:16.740 --> 15:17.906
(Scoffs) Whatever.

15:17.941 --> 15:19.608
I was just trying to give you
a fair warning, you're about

15:19.610 --> 15:21.376
to get kicked out of school.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.378
Hey, oh. You're not actually
gonna turn me in, are you?

15:23.380 --> 15:25.263
Not if you stop pranking us.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.449
Wow, you are really uptight.

15:27.484 --> 15:29.451
Okay, no more pranks.

15:29.503 --> 15:31.219
And you ruined our
bathroom, so we get yours.

15:31.255 --> 15:32.487
Well, then where are we supposed to go?

15:32.522 --> 15:34.272
To the athletic center next door.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.291
No, no. No way. That's not gonna happen.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.459
All right, cool. Yeah, nice knowing you.

15:37.494 --> 15:39.210
Wait! Um, okay. I got an idea.

15:39.263 --> 15:41.062
We'll play you for it.

15:41.098 --> 15:42.097
Excuse me?

15:42.132 --> 15:43.281
Dorm triathlon.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.299
Three events.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.201
Winner gets exclusive
rights to the bathroom.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.887
Loser... (Clicks tongue)
does their business next door.

15:48.922 --> 15:50.889
No, why would I agree to
that when I have these?

15:50.941 --> 15:52.774
Well, all that really proves
is that some guy had to use

15:52.826 --> 15:54.743
the john in the middle of the night.

15:56.146 --> 15:58.713
We win, we get the bathroom.

15:58.715 --> 16:00.849
Yep, and then you'll be back
to your books by happy hour.

16:00.901 --> 16:01.900
Promise.

16:03.020 --> 16:04.703
(Sighs) Fine. We're in.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.756
Let the games begin.

16:11.945 --> 16:12.877
(Scoffs)

16:17.244 --> 16:19.344
Ok, so the trick with Tug of War

16:19.346 --> 16:21.313
is to go small in the front

16:21.315 --> 16:23.448
with our strongest in the back.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.084
So Travis, you're our anchor.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.419
Where do you want me, Coach?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.221
Uh, well it's five-on-five,

16:29.256 --> 16:30.188
so I think we're good here.

16:30.224 --> 16:31.223
Oh, sure.

16:31.225 --> 16:32.190
No problem.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.126
Just remember,

16:34.161 --> 16:36.011
give them a little at first,

16:36.046 --> 16:37.295
and then start pulling.

16:37.348 --> 16:39.181
It'll throw them off balance.

Do any of those guys actually live on 2A?

No, actually most of the
lacrosse team lives in Fisher,

17:40.394 --> 17:41.293
except for Dominick,

17:41.529 --> 17:42.761
who lives at home with his grandmother.

17:42.797 --> 17:43.829
It's a touching story, actually.

17:43.864 --> 17:45.581
You brought in ringers?

17:45.633 --> 17:46.632
That's cheating.

17:46.667 --> 17:49.485
Eh, cheating is such an ugly word.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.536
We never said anything

17:50.571 --> 17:52.404
about a residency requirement.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.507
I think it's implied in
the phrase "dorm triathlon."

17:55.543 --> 17:56.508
Oh.

17:56.544 --> 17:58.310
Think about professional sports.

17:58.346 --> 18:01.313
Think everybody who plays for the
Royals is actually from Kansas City?

18:02.450 --> 18:04.250
Hey, cheer up. Don't worry about it.

18:04.302 --> 18:06.101
I'm sure you guys can make a comeback.

18:16.006 --> 18:18.220
_

18:19.221 --> 18:21.521
Your work is very impressive.

18:22.052 --> 18:25.037
It shows an artistic sensibility
far beyond your years.

18:25.142 --> 18:26.208
That's our Bay.

18:26.210 --> 18:28.143
Super mature.

18:28.179 --> 18:31.146
So, uh, does that mean I'm in the showcase?

18:31.198 --> 18:34.833
I should pretend I need
to think about it, but yes.

18:34.885 --> 18:36.035
We'd love to show your work.

18:36.087 --> 18:39.772
Thank you. Oh, you have no
idea how much this means to me.

18:39.807 --> 18:40.889
Now, I'm going to be writing

18:40.891 --> 18:42.775
a profile on you for our program,

18:42.827 --> 18:44.526
um...

18:44.578 --> 18:46.845
Just have a few questions.

18:48.999 --> 18:49.932
Can we sit?

18:52.486 --> 18:53.802
I will go make some drinks.

18:53.838 --> 18:54.770
Okay.

18:57.808 --> 18:58.741
So...

18:59.827 --> 19:00.776
Tell me.

19:00.778 --> 19:02.461
Are you in school?

19:02.496 --> 19:05.264
No, um... not right now.

19:05.299 --> 19:06.682
I'm taking some time off

19:06.684 --> 19:08.484
to explore my horizons.

19:08.486 --> 19:12.554
I've recently become involved
with some community projects.

19:12.590 --> 19:14.273
You mean charity work. Oh.

19:14.308 --> 19:15.524
What exactly do you do?

19:15.559 --> 19:17.459
Environmental cleanup.

19:17.495 --> 19:19.161
Fantastic!

19:19.163 --> 19:20.262
I'll put that in.

19:20.297 --> 19:21.463
Who's thirsty?

19:26.137 --> 19:27.236
Uh, here's a blanket.

19:27.238 --> 19:28.203
It's kind of chilly in here.

19:30.174 --> 19:32.007
I have terrible circulation.

19:38.048 --> 19:39.214
Okay.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.816
I'm beginning to seriously question

19:40.851 --> 19:43.068
my new partner's creative taste.

19:44.872 --> 19:45.838
What is this?

19:45.873 --> 19:49.057
That is quality European
paint you've got there.

19:49.093 --> 19:52.060
It reminds me of one of my son's crappy
Crayola crayons he never wants to use.

19:52.113 --> 19:54.696
Don't candy coat it, tell
me how you really feel.

19:54.732 --> 19:55.931
I hate it.

19:55.966 --> 19:58.634
Are you always this tactful?

19:58.686 --> 20:00.836
Because it could take some getting used to.

20:00.871 --> 20:02.571
It's my personal philosophy,

20:02.623 --> 20:04.506
honed from years of trial and error...

20:04.542 --> 20:06.558
complete honesty.

20:06.594 --> 20:08.644
More like brutal honesty.

20:08.646 --> 20:09.845
(Chuckles)

20:09.880 --> 20:10.779
So...

20:10.831 --> 20:12.498
You have a son?

20:12.533 --> 20:14.383
Yeah, will.

20:15.419 --> 20:16.518
He's nine.

20:16.554 --> 20:17.486
Any other kids?

20:18.622 --> 20:19.621
Nope, just the one.

20:19.657 --> 20:21.457
What about his mom?

20:21.509 --> 20:22.458
You married?

20:24.311 --> 20:25.427
She died when he was three.

20:26.597 --> 20:28.197
I'm sorry.

20:30.367 --> 20:31.300
How'd she die?

20:33.270 --> 20:34.386
Cancer.

20:36.290 --> 20:37.289
(Sighs)

20:39.293 --> 20:42.177
I lost my husband earlier this year.

20:42.213 --> 20:43.929
Car accident.

20:45.032 --> 20:46.865
It was really tough on my daughters.

20:47.868 --> 20:48.867
Yeah, I know how that works.

20:50.888 --> 20:51.887
Okay.

20:51.922 --> 20:53.055
You are seriously gonna have to trust me

20:53.090 --> 20:54.056
with this paint color.

20:55.025 --> 20:56.158
Hold the ladder?

20:56.193 --> 20:57.743
Sure.

20:59.830 --> 21:00.796
All right.

21:01.966 --> 21:03.732
When you see it on the wall,

21:03.767 --> 21:05.067
I think you're gonna want to apologize.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.003
All right.

21:13.777 --> 21:14.743
Well...

21:14.778 --> 21:16.495
I'm seeing it on my shirt now,

21:16.530 --> 21:18.580
and I'm still hating it.

21:18.582 --> 21:19.581
Oh. (Laughs)

21:19.617 --> 21:20.716
I'm so sorry.

21:20.718 --> 21:22.568
No big deal. It's an old shirt.

21:23.621 --> 21:26.321
If we get into cold water
right away we can save it.

21:26.323 --> 21:27.539
Come on.

21:28.759 --> 21:29.725
(Sighs)

21:32.530 --> 21:33.529
Okay.

21:33.564 --> 21:37.165
I think we're officially
done with puke orange.

21:37.167 --> 21:38.350
I'll put this in the back.

21:47.751 --> 21:49.425
Ok, quiet everyone!

21:49.513 --> 21:51.029
Roll sound!

21:51.065 --> 21:52.147
Taylor: And... action!

21:52.149 --> 21:53.916
You wouldn't dare.

21:53.968 --> 21:55.250
Oh yeah? Try me.

21:55.302 --> 21:57.269
(Bag rustling)

21:57.304 --> 21:58.854
Cut! Cut!

21:58.889 --> 21:59.821
What the hell is that?

22:01.158 --> 22:02.124
(Bag rustling)

22:04.929 --> 22:06.812
- (Chips crunching)
- Are you kidding me right now?

22:08.303 --> 22:10.987
_

22:12.320 --> 22:14.737
_

22:15.606 --> 22:16.738
Skye, tell me we got it?

22:17.841 --> 22:18.907
(Sighs) No.

22:18.959 --> 22:20.659
Assistant director: It's
gonna take an hour to reset.

22:21.679 --> 22:22.711
An hour?

22:26.212 --> 22:28.195
_

22:29.596 --> 22:31.311
_

22:35.707 --> 22:37.523
Ok everybody, gather up!

22:38.643 --> 22:41.411
All right, round two. "Butts up."

22:41.413 --> 22:42.462
Oh, yeah.

22:42.497 --> 22:44.430
Ball comes to you and you miss it,

22:44.466 --> 22:46.566
you've got to run and touch the
wall before someone throws you out.

22:46.601 --> 22:48.384
If you miss,

22:48.420 --> 22:49.335
well, then...

22:49.371 --> 22:50.336
Butts up.

22:51.339 --> 22:53.222
Take one in the shorts. Got it?

22:53.224 --> 22:55.141
Good. Last man standing wins.

23:00.265 --> 23:02.398
You brought a Gold Glove third basemen

23:02.434 --> 23:04.367
to our dorm triathlon?

23:04.402 --> 23:06.169
How do you know John Kennish?

23:07.205 --> 23:09.005
He's my dad,

23:09.007 --> 23:10.807
and our ringer.

23:12.077 --> 23:13.026
Okay.

23:13.078 --> 23:14.877
Toss me the rock, son.

23:14.913 --> 23:15.912
Time to break the ice.

23:18.216 --> 23:19.148
Shall we?

23:27.008 --> 23:28.591
Here you go.

23:28.643 --> 23:29.592
Good as new.

23:29.611 --> 23:30.560
Huh.

23:32.614 --> 23:33.579
Thanks.

23:34.582 --> 23:35.598
(Sighs)

23:35.634 --> 23:36.549
I always thought about

23:36.601 --> 23:38.601
getting one, I just
never found a piece of art

23:38.603 --> 23:40.653
that I was comfortable
committing to for life.

23:41.790 --> 23:43.539
I don't think of them as art.

23:43.591 --> 23:45.675
For better or worse,

23:45.710 --> 23:47.677
they're a road map of my life.

23:47.712 --> 23:48.645
Hmm.

23:50.415 --> 23:51.414
Why'd you get this?

23:51.416 --> 23:53.249
Got this the week Will was born.

23:53.301 --> 23:56.252
It's how I felt after seeing
my son for the first time.

23:57.455 --> 23:58.454
And this?

23:58.490 --> 24:00.423
Spain, December of '96.

24:00.458 --> 24:02.058
I was so drunk,

24:02.093 --> 24:03.309
I don't even remember getting that one.

24:03.361 --> 24:04.277
(Both chuckle)

24:04.312 --> 24:05.495
Nice.

24:05.530 --> 24:06.446
Oh.

24:06.498 --> 24:08.164
Hope.

24:10.001 --> 24:11.017
I love that word.

24:14.072 --> 24:15.154
It's not a word.

24:16.291 --> 24:17.840
A name?

24:18.910 --> 24:19.859
(Sighs)

24:20.945 --> 24:21.911
Your wife.

24:23.031 --> 24:26.983
<i>♪ I don't want to be
what you want me to be ♪</i>

24:27.018 --> 24:29.102
You do not like talking
about yourself, do you?

24:33.758 --> 24:36.008
I really want to kiss you.

24:37.812 --> 24:38.761
Right now.

24:41.866 --> 24:43.416
There's that honesty again.

24:44.803 --> 24:50.373

25:50.568 --> 25:51.784
Sure you're not getting tired, old man?

25:51.820 --> 25:54.604

26:12.390 --> 26:13.422
Get to it, son.

26:13.424 --> 26:16.175
Aw, come on. Are you kidding me?

26:16.227 --> 26:17.193
You're a pro.

26:18.196 --> 26:19.295
You're not gonna bean a kid, are you?

26:20.465 --> 26:22.131
You're right.

26:45.056 --> 26:46.772
Nice arm.

26:46.808 --> 26:47.857
Yeah.

26:50.028 --> 26:51.661
<i>♪ It's on ♪</i>

26:51.713 --> 26:53.713
(All laughing)

26:53.765 --> 26:55.965
Well, that's everything unless there's
anything else you want to tell me.

26:55.967 --> 26:58.718
Uh... yeah, you know what?

26:58.770 --> 27:00.736
Nothing comes to mind.

27:00.738 --> 27:03.706
Well, great. Then I'll have someone
over to pick up your piece next week.

27:04.776 --> 27:06.759
(Anklet beeping)

27:06.794 --> 27:07.743
What's that noise?

27:07.779 --> 27:09.645
- Smoke alarm?
- It's a cellphone.

27:10.815 --> 27:12.865
I think it's coming from your leg.

27:16.838 --> 27:18.638
(Sighs)

27:18.690 --> 27:21.490
That beeping means the battery is dying

27:21.526 --> 27:22.725
on my ankle monitor.

27:25.697 --> 27:27.530
I'm not really taking a gap year,

27:27.565 --> 27:29.215
I'm on house arrest.

27:29.267 --> 27:31.634
And I'm not really doing charity work,

27:31.636 --> 27:34.320
I'm on a cleanup crew
for my felony conviction.

27:34.372 --> 27:37.406
You have been so nice
and supportive of my work,

27:37.425 --> 27:40.376
and I totally suck for lying to you.

27:40.411 --> 27:42.028
I see.

27:42.063 --> 27:43.062
Please, Ms. Berdick,

27:43.114 --> 27:45.114
I swear I'm a good person,

27:45.166 --> 27:46.449
and I really need this.

27:46.451 --> 27:48.251
Is there any way you can make an exception?

27:48.253 --> 27:49.352
(Beeping continues)

27:49.387 --> 27:51.187
I'm afraid I can't.

27:51.222 --> 27:52.355
Good luck to you.

27:52.390 --> 27:54.106
I hope you can get your life together.

27:54.158 --> 27:56.242
Yeah. Me too.

27:59.964 --> 28:00.930
(Sighs)

28:03.017 --> 28:04.183
We were so close.

28:04.235 --> 28:05.785
I hate this damn thing!

28:05.820 --> 28:06.786
(Beeping)

28:06.821 --> 28:07.803
Come on, I need to plug it in

28:07.839 --> 28:09.872
before the battery dies or else I am...

28:09.924 --> 28:11.007
(beeping stops)

28:12.043 --> 28:13.075
Totally screwed.

28:16.915 --> 28:17.947
Hey.

28:24.923 --> 28:26.606
Are you okay?

28:26.658 --> 28:27.990
Yeah, I'm fine.

28:30.662 --> 28:32.578
We won "Butts up."

28:32.630 --> 28:33.829
Tied the triathlon.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.599
That's great.

28:36.651 --> 28:37.733
Congratulations.

28:38.903 --> 28:40.620
Why weren't you there?

28:41.806 --> 28:43.539
Why wasn't I there?

28:45.443 --> 28:48.344
Because no one told me
about it. That's why.

28:48.396 --> 28:50.579
In case you haven't noticed,

28:50.615 --> 28:53.499
people around here don't know I exist.

28:53.534 --> 28:54.684
That's not true.

28:54.719 --> 28:56.519
Yeah, it is.

28:56.554 --> 28:57.653
Even you do it.

28:58.690 --> 29:01.557
When I tried to volunteer
for the Tug of War,

29:01.592 --> 29:04.160
you acted like I wasn't there.

29:05.229 --> 29:06.262
I thought

29:06.297 --> 29:08.397
roommates were supposed
to look out for each other.

29:09.434 --> 29:11.233
I'm sorry, I didn't realize...

29:11.285 --> 29:12.318
It doesn't matter.

29:12.370 --> 29:14.253
The truth is

29:14.305 --> 29:16.205
I'm not really one of you.

29:17.375 --> 29:20.226
I'm just the dumb hearing girl

29:20.261 --> 29:22.278
who no one wants to slow down

29:22.313 --> 29:24.080
enough to talk to.

29:37.159 --> 29:38.658
Ok, so, tennis ball is one thing.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.660
But let's see what you can do

29:40.695 --> 29:42.261
with the real deal.

29:42.263 --> 29:43.229
Okay?

29:50.205 --> 29:51.170
(Beeps)

29:54.192 --> 29:56.392
So you're telling me

29:56.444 --> 29:59.162
that you only played little league?

29:59.163 --> 30:04.002
_

30:04.219 --> 30:06.069
Well, son, put on that glove.

30:06.104 --> 30:07.420
'Cause you're about to get

30:07.455 --> 30:08.421
a second chance.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.075
Hi, Travis.

30:12.110 --> 30:13.910
Hey, sweetie, what are you doing here?

30:13.945 --> 30:15.028
I got you a little present.

30:16.948 --> 30:18.164
You didn't have to do that.

30:20.919 --> 30:22.085
Oh, what's this for?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.770
For your textbooks.

30:23.805 --> 30:25.855
All the kids on campus are using them now.

30:25.891 --> 30:26.823
Thank you.

30:26.825 --> 30:27.907
So,

30:27.959 --> 30:30.043
what class did you sign up for, honey?

30:30.095 --> 30:32.645
You know, I don't think I'm gonna do that.

30:32.681 --> 30:33.663
Wait,

30:33.698 --> 30:34.697
why not?

30:34.733 --> 30:37.700
And what are you guys doing here, anyway?

30:37.752 --> 30:38.701
You know what,

30:38.703 --> 30:40.553
just watch for one second, okay?

30:54.686 --> 30:55.685
Wow!

30:55.720 --> 30:56.653
Yeah.

30:56.705 --> 30:57.704
(John chuckles)

30:57.739 --> 30:59.539
Unbelievable, right?

30:59.591 --> 31:01.624
This kid has a real future in baseball,

31:01.626 --> 31:02.625
and I'm gonna help him.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.279
Okay, but...

31:06.314 --> 31:09.282
You said you wanted to explore
what you missed in college.

31:09.317 --> 31:10.466
What happened?

31:10.502 --> 31:12.468
Honestly, the same thing
that happened the first time.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.355
My plans changed because of the game.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.490
Okay. (Sighs)

31:20.328 --> 31:22.295
I swear, I plugged it in.

31:22.330 --> 31:23.413
It's this cord.

31:23.448 --> 31:24.380
There must be a short in it.

31:24.432 --> 31:25.381
Wait here.

31:25.433 --> 31:26.399
(Sighs)

31:28.153 --> 31:30.153
She's gonna add more time
to my sentence, I know it.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.354
I'm not gonna get to L.A. till I'm 30!

31:31.389 --> 31:33.880
Calm down. Everything's gonna be okay.

31:33.908 --> 31:35.758
No, it is not gonna be okay.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.860
I needed that showcase and now it's just

31:37.896 --> 31:38.995
another thing that I've lost

31:39.030 --> 31:39.996
all because of her.

31:40.031 --> 31:42.799
You know I think what you did was crazy,

31:42.834 --> 31:44.000
but it was your choice.

31:44.112 --> 31:45.111
I know,

31:45.163 --> 31:47.864
and you know what really pisses me off?

31:47.916 --> 31:50.667
Is that I don't even get to be mad at her

31:50.702 --> 31:52.018
without feeling guilty about it.

31:53.655 --> 31:54.904
That's why I can't be in
the same room with her.

31:54.939 --> 31:56.072
I just end up...

31:56.107 --> 31:57.690
hating myself.

32:00.795 --> 32:03.846
Well, if you could go back right now,

32:03.882 --> 32:05.698
would you do anything differently?

32:11.840 --> 32:12.805
No.

32:14.642 --> 32:15.808
Daphne's not in prison.

32:17.445 --> 32:18.695
She still gets to be a doctor.

32:18.697 --> 32:19.729
She's been killing herself,

32:19.764 --> 32:21.631
making sure that she doesn't let you down.

32:21.666 --> 32:22.765
Officer: Here you go.

32:23.802 --> 32:24.767
New charger.

32:24.803 --> 32:26.369
Go home, plug in.

32:26.404 --> 32:28.538
They'll start monitoring
you again in a couple hours.

32:28.573 --> 32:29.539
Wait, that's it?

32:29.574 --> 32:30.490
I'm in a good mood.

32:33.628 --> 32:34.594
Did you hear that?

32:34.629 --> 32:36.479
She said you've got a couple hours.

32:36.514 --> 32:38.231
That pretty much

32:38.283 --> 32:40.149
means to me we can do
whatever the heck you want.

32:41.252 --> 32:44.137
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
- So... what'll it be?

32:57.638 --> 32:59.478
I'm the worst roommate ever.

32:59.938 --> 33:02.038
And you have been so great to me.

33:02.073 --> 33:03.122
I wouldn't even have an interpreter

33:03.158 --> 33:04.123
if it weren't for you.

33:05.812 --> 33:06.811
I've just

33:06.846 --> 33:08.830
been really caught up in my own stuff.

33:10.950 --> 33:11.949
I'm so sorry.

33:13.103 --> 33:15.019
You have a lot going on.

33:15.055 --> 33:16.821
I mean, you are pre-med.

33:19.826 --> 33:21.826
Well, I'm not gonna make a very good doctor

33:21.878 --> 33:25.730
if I can't even tell when the
people around me are hurting.

33:27.701 --> 33:28.649
It's just...

33:29.903 --> 33:30.868
ASL.

33:32.505 --> 33:33.838
It's way faster than I thought it'd be.

33:33.840 --> 33:36.708
I'm pretty good one-on-one, but...

33:37.811 --> 33:39.727
(Sighs) When everyone's together...

33:41.648 --> 33:42.780
I'm totally lost.

33:45.351 --> 33:47.435
That's like me in chemistry most the time.

33:52.292 --> 33:53.458
You know, I'm starting to think

33:53.493 --> 33:55.326
coming here was a huge mistake.

33:55.378 --> 33:56.327
No!

33:56.379 --> 33:57.361
No.

33:58.398 --> 33:59.363
You're gonna be fine,

33:59.399 --> 34:00.398
because I'm gonna help you.

34:01.501 --> 34:02.567
We're roommates.

34:04.137 --> 34:05.369
We look out for each other, right?

34:08.141 --> 34:09.407
Serena: Hey. We got to book it.

34:09.442 --> 34:11.141
Mud run's in 10 minutes.

34:14.063 --> 34:15.295
What's that all about?

34:16.449 --> 34:18.081
The dorm triathlon.

34:18.134 --> 34:20.301
The final event is a mud run.

34:20.335 --> 34:21.886
Oh, that's cool.

34:21.955 --> 34:22.856
I did that once in my summer camp.

34:29.396 --> 34:30.945
Iris: Are you sure about this?

34:31.170 --> 34:32.452
I never said I was great at it.

34:32.504 --> 34:35.371
If we lose, everyone will hate me.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.090
No, they won't.

34:37.141 --> 34:39.226
If we lose, we lose.

34:39.261 --> 34:41.178
At least we'll go down as a team.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.164
Okay, so...

34:44.199 --> 34:46.283
You're the only one of
us who's done this before.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.051
Do you have any advice?

Hi.

37:32.818 --> 37:33.950
Hey, is everything okay?

37:33.986 --> 37:35.785
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.654
Um, I was just wondering
if you ended up taking

37:37.706 --> 37:38.822
those boxes to the church.

37:38.874 --> 37:40.974
Oh, actually I didn't get
a chance to get there today.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.008
So...

They're still here.

I'm not ready to give up his stuff yet.

37:55.891 --> 37:57.440
Sure.

37:59.478 --> 38:02.612
I'll get John and we'll help
you bring them back upstairs.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.348

38:58.170 --> 39:01.187
And I should have stood up for you.

I don't know why I did that.

40:02.301 --> 40:05.135
I have a boyfriend, too,

40:05.137 --> 40:07.053
in Indiana.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.275
Well, we should probably go.

Ah, well, I came here

to apologize to you.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.951
But now I realize I don't
need to do that, so...

40:37.986 --> 40:39.069
Please, Bay, wait.

40:39.071 --> 40:42.122
Listen, you have every
right to be mad at me.

40:42.157 --> 40:44.124
I should have never let you take the fall.

could go back to that day
