WEBVTT

00:03.998 --> 00:05.123
BARRY BERKMAN:
Can we reset, maybe?

00:05.331 --> 00:07.832
I just feel like you've got
some toxic masculinity issues

00:07.832 --> 00:09.248
you need to work out
and until then

00:09.248 --> 00:11.123
we just shouldn't interact
so much or--

00:11.123 --> 00:13.164
like, at all, you know?

00:14.081 --> 00:15.665
My gut says we're missing
something,

00:15.665 --> 00:17.123
and we're not done
with the acting class.

00:17.123 --> 00:18.289
DETECTIVE LOACH: Come on, Moss.

00:18.289 --> 00:20.123
Why're you holding onto this?

00:20.123 --> 00:21.498
The siren returns.

00:22.415 --> 00:24.164
Oh! We're going right into it,
okay!

00:24.164 --> 00:25.456
-DETECTIVE MOSS: Yeah!
-GENE COUSINEAU: Okay!

00:25.957 --> 00:27.748
FUCHES: What's this
Bolivian fellow's name?

00:27.957 --> 00:29.790
Cristobal Sifuentes.

00:29.790 --> 00:30.873
Take his stash house.

00:31.206 --> 00:33.748
Then when he comes up here to LA
to deal with that, you kill him.

00:33.748 --> 00:35.123
BARRY:
He's a marine named Taylor.

00:35.123 --> 00:36.623
He knows about the hit.
He wants in.

00:36.623 --> 00:37.748
He's probably crazy.

00:37.748 --> 00:40.081
FUCHES:
You and wacko do the hit...

00:41.998 --> 00:43.498
...and then afterwards,
you take him out.

00:43.498 --> 00:44.998
-FUCHES: Mm-hmm.

00:46.873 --> 00:48.748
Check it out.
Dude, this is mega.

00:48.748 --> 00:50.665
We've hit the freakin' jackpot.

00:50.665 --> 00:51.998
We're a team, brother.

00:53.123 --> 00:55.665
Fuches, Taylor. Taylor, Fuches.

00:56.707 --> 00:57.790
Hey, man.

01:27.498 --> 01:29.456
So, this is where the Bolivians
are gonna land?

01:29.456 --> 01:31.373
Barry :
According to Paco, yeah.

01:31.373 --> 01:33.081
Taylor :
You know what?

01:33.081 --> 01:35.540
I honestly think
we should knock
that shit out in midair.

01:35.540 --> 01:38.456
I know this guy
in Tijuana who can get us
some FIM-92 Stingers.

01:38.456 --> 01:40.206
Fucking boom.

01:40.206 --> 01:43.540
We'll be celebrating with
cervezas before that shit
even hits the ground.

01:43.540 --> 01:46.164
Sweet. Yeah.
Um, brute force is

01:46.164 --> 01:48.289
a total valid tactic,
but I think in this case,

01:48.289 --> 01:50.540
maybe going surgical
is the better way to go.

01:50.540 --> 01:53.373
You know, put me up
with a rifle on top
of the hill there,

01:53.373 --> 01:55.540
and they'll land
someplace here,

01:55.540 --> 01:58.707
and I'll shoot the Bolivian
leader when he gets off
the, uh, the plane.

01:58.707 --> 02:01.498
But keep the suggestions
coming, man. All good stuff.

02:02.915 --> 02:06.081
I think, uh,
Taylor's gonna be
clutch with this.

02:06.081 --> 02:08.456
He wants to shoot
the plane out of midair

02:08.456 --> 02:10.415
and then drink beers.

02:10.415 --> 02:12.289
Well, I mean,
you can teach discretion,

02:12.289 --> 02:17.039
but, frankly,
what he needs, Fuches,
is someone like you to, uh...

02:17.039 --> 02:18.790
Taylor: Or if we had
a few more dudes,

02:18.790 --> 02:21.331
we could just bum-rush
these motherfuckers.

02:21.331 --> 02:22.540
...to mold him.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.790
Don't try
and Parent Trap  me,
dickhead.

02:24.790 --> 02:26.790
You think
you can stick me
with this donkey

02:26.790 --> 02:28.456
and then go be
Hugh Grant? No!

02:28.456 --> 02:30.915
You should've killed him
at the stash house like
you were supposed to.

02:30.915 --> 02:33.206
Taylor :
This would be a sweet place
for a hot tub.

02:34.123 --> 02:35.456
Fly in some chicks...

02:37.081 --> 02:38.081
fuck 'em.

02:39.081 --> 02:40.081
Oh.
I can't--

02:40.081 --> 02:41.498
I can't--
I can't watch this.

02:41.498 --> 02:43.164
I'll be in the car.

02:43.164 --> 02:47.123
You-- You need
to kill this guy before
he gets you killed.

02:47.123 --> 02:50.248
And this--
this would be
a terrible place

02:50.248 --> 02:51.748
for a hot tub!
A fucking...

02:51.748 --> 02:52.998
hot tub!

02:54.373 --> 02:55.748
Did Fuches
just say hot tub?

03:08.832 --> 03:10.498
Noho Hank:
Oh. Watch your step here.

03:10.498 --> 03:11.957
That's a big one.

03:11.957 --> 03:13.748
Hey, you know,
if we knock down that wall,

03:13.748 --> 03:15.289
it would really
open the place up.

03:15.289 --> 03:18.790
You know, clean up the blood,
maybe add some French doors,

03:18.790 --> 03:21.456
Maybe a ping-pong
table right there.
You know?

03:21.456 --> 03:22.665
I'm just riffing.

03:22.665 --> 03:25.289
Now Cristobal
will come here to US.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.081
Hey!

03:27.081 --> 03:29.665
You took my fucking
stash house!

03:29.665 --> 03:31.915
I'm going to slit
your fucking throats.

03:31.915 --> 03:33.873
And we will be
waiting for him.

03:33.873 --> 03:35.748
Yes, because they
are short, right.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.623
Right.
Goran, this is great
physical comedy of you.

03:38.623 --> 03:41.957
It costs, it costs.
Oh, it's good, though.

03:43.957 --> 03:44.873
What?

03:44.873 --> 03:47.540
I have
prezentatsiya  for you.

03:48.998 --> 03:50.707
Okay, I take photos.

03:50.707 --> 03:53.498
All time, Barry
no doing hit. No, no.

03:53.498 --> 03:56.164
Barry buy
fancy new clothes.

03:56.164 --> 03:58.456
Barry have sex with nun.

03:58.456 --> 04:00.707
Barry buying
laptop computer.

04:02.206 --> 04:03.331
No hit.

04:06.039 --> 04:08.081
You're so creepy, man.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.248
You're just
so fucking creepy.

04:10.248 --> 04:11.748
You were
following Barry?

04:13.373 --> 04:14.915
Who tell you
to do this?

04:16.373 --> 04:19.289
Whole point is that Barry

04:19.289 --> 04:21.707
have no connection
to our family.

04:21.707 --> 04:24.790
You follow him around
and be personal photographer?

04:24.790 --> 04:27.540
That's connection!
Why would you do this?

04:29.832 --> 04:31.915
He kill my brother.

04:31.915 --> 04:34.039
Okay, you need
to let that go. Okay?
Oh my God.

04:34.039 --> 04:36.707
No one cares.
It's so boring.

04:36.707 --> 04:39.248
Every day
with "kill my brother."

04:39.248 --> 04:42.498
Look! Barry got us
stash house!

04:42.498 --> 04:45.790
Beautiful,
super awesome,
sexy stash house!

04:45.790 --> 04:47.707
It's so nice.
He does great work!

04:49.206 --> 04:51.915
Let me kill him.
Are you deaf?

04:53.123 --> 04:55.665
Leave him alone.

04:55.665 --> 04:59.164
Boss--
Look. Here, finally,

04:59.164 --> 05:01.498
is job that is
tailor-made for you.

05:01.498 --> 05:03.832
Chop, chop, chop.
Blood and guts.

05:03.832 --> 05:09.873
You can wear your apron
and your fucking creepy
hockey mask.

05:09.873 --> 05:12.289
But no Barry.

05:14.873 --> 05:16.415
Vacha:
Okay.

05:19.415 --> 05:21.540
I leave Barry alone.

05:34.665 --> 05:37.289
Hi.

05:37.289 --> 05:38.331
What time is it?

05:38.331 --> 05:39.456
I have 8:10.

05:40.581 --> 05:41.623
I gotta go to work.

05:41.623 --> 05:43.581
Not on an empty stomach.

05:47.456 --> 05:49.707
You know, it's our
one-week anniversary.

05:49.707 --> 05:51.957
Don't you think
I would have forgotten that.

05:51.957 --> 05:53.164
Okay.

05:55.998 --> 05:58.289
Gene, this has been
really wonderful,

05:58.289 --> 06:00.289
and-- Wait.

06:04.623 --> 06:06.957
This has gotta end, honey.

06:06.957 --> 06:09.289
Because I've ju-- I mean,
I've let it go too far.

06:09.289 --> 06:10.790
I'm still investigating
your class.

06:10.790 --> 06:14.289
This is just--
this is just way beyond
over the line.

06:14.289 --> 06:15.665
Whose line?
My line.

06:15.665 --> 06:16.998
Your line.
Every line.

06:16.998 --> 06:18.957
It's just--
Janice,
for three nights,

06:18.957 --> 06:22.873
you've come home
and told me that everybody
is up in your grill at work,

06:22.873 --> 06:27.206
because you can't
let go of this crazy
acting class connection.

06:27.206 --> 06:28.623
I never said,
"up in my grill,"

06:28.623 --> 06:31.039
so you can stop there.
Okay, the point is--
the point is,

06:31.039 --> 06:32.957
nobody believes
that my class

06:32.957 --> 06:36.498
could be involved
in Ryan's death
except for you.

06:36.498 --> 06:39.081
I myself thought that
you were questioning them

06:39.081 --> 06:40.748
because you wanted
to be close to me.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.957
I... I was very flattered.

06:44.998 --> 06:46.957
But now I've gotta wonder.

06:46.957 --> 06:49.081
Are you keeping them in play

06:49.081 --> 06:51.707
because you're
trying to prevent us
from becoming

06:51.707 --> 06:54.164
what we might become?
No. It is not--

06:54.164 --> 06:56.456
No, no, that's not
what's happening here.

06:56.456 --> 06:57.832
Well, that's
good, Janice.
Okay.

06:57.832 --> 06:59.790
Now, I know that
it's only three days,

06:59.790 --> 07:01.373
but I'm 47 years old.

07:01.373 --> 07:03.039
I am old enough
to know a great thing

07:03.039 --> 07:04.623
when it comes
knocking on my door

07:04.623 --> 07:06.081
in the middle of the night.

07:06.081 --> 07:11.039
We are breathing rarefied air,
and you know it.

07:11.039 --> 07:14.206
If we ran away from this
because we were scared,

07:14.206 --> 07:17.373
wouldn't that be,
oh, so very sad?

07:17.373 --> 07:20.039
♪ ♪

07:31.707 --> 07:34.540
Woman :
Oh! Good! More!

07:34.540 --> 07:37.790
Man : Yeah.
Woman: Oh yes!

07:37.790 --> 07:40.581
Woman : Oh, good!

07:43.998 --> 07:46.498
Killer job, um,

07:46.498 --> 07:48.415
on the recon
at the airstrip today.

07:48.415 --> 07:51.331
Man:
Like that?
Lot of great suggestions.

07:51.331 --> 07:52.707
Just came
real naturally to you.

07:52.707 --> 07:54.998
I'm a Marine,
just like you.

07:56.331 --> 07:58.373
Look at what this chick does
to this dude's asshole.

07:58.373 --> 08:01.081
You know,
if you keep it up
at this level,

08:01.081 --> 08:02.873
you know,
there's a world where...

08:02.873 --> 08:06.081
Woman: Oh yeah!

08:06.081 --> 08:08.540
...you could take over...
Woman:
Yes, yes, yes!

08:08.540 --> 08:10.957
...for me, and I,
in turn, could...

08:12.915 --> 08:13.915
leave.

08:13.915 --> 08:15.415
So, I'd work for Fuches?

08:15.415 --> 08:18.331
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That'd be cool, right?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.832
No. That dude sucks.

08:20.832 --> 08:22.957
Can you pause this?
Is there a way we can--

08:22.957 --> 08:24.456
What's his cut?
What's he take off the top?

08:24.456 --> 08:26.164
Just half.

08:26.164 --> 08:28.415
What?
Dude, fuck that.

08:28.415 --> 08:31.164
No, no, no, the way
he explains it, though--
That fucker's scamming you.

08:31.164 --> 08:33.915
He's not scamming me,
all right? We've been working
with each other for years.

08:33.915 --> 08:36.123
We're-- we're a team.
So, why you wanna leave?

08:37.456 --> 08:39.790
Well, you know,
I'm just at a place
where I wanna...

08:41.790 --> 08:44.123
branch out
and explore new...

08:45.289 --> 08:46.456
opportunities.

08:46.456 --> 08:47.498
But he won't let you?

08:47.498 --> 08:49.039
It's not that
he won't let me.

08:49.039 --> 08:51.957
It's just that
he doesn't like me
doing other things.

08:51.957 --> 08:53.456
You should
fucking ace that dude.

08:53.456 --> 08:54.915
Taylor.

08:56.206 --> 08:58.289
Kill Fuches?

08:58.289 --> 09:01.248
I
Well, you do what
you wanna do.

09:01.248 --> 09:03.415
You should get rid of him.

09:03.415 --> 09:04.748
Woman:
Oh, my ass.

09:04.748 --> 09:06.123
Here.

09:07.623 --> 09:08.915
What's this?

09:08.915 --> 09:11.790
Money from the stash house.

09:11.790 --> 09:13.540
I counted it out.
This is your half.

09:13.540 --> 09:16.081
Hey, uh,
this money's dirty.

09:16.081 --> 09:18.331
Uh, you can't spend it.
You need it cleaned.

09:18.331 --> 09:20.373
And no,
I'm not gonna ace Fuches.

09:20.373 --> 09:23.998
He's essentially family,
and I think if you
give him a chance,

09:23.998 --> 09:28.456
you'll see that
you two working together
makes total sense.

09:28.456 --> 09:31.415
You take that money,
kill Fuches,

09:31.415 --> 09:32.915
live your dreams.

09:32.915 --> 09:35.707
Watch how much
this guy jizzes.

09:37.498 --> 09:38.498
Fucking shame.

09:38.498 --> 09:40.498
Man :
Oh wow.
Boy: Hey, Dad.

09:43.206 --> 09:44.206
Who's this?

09:48.039 --> 09:51.039
Well, that's me when I got out
of the Marine Corps and, uh...

09:51.915 --> 09:53.415
I don't remember
who this man is.

09:56.081 --> 09:57.164
Where's your sister?

09:58.373 --> 10:00.206
You guys gotta
get to school.

10:00.206 --> 10:01.915
Fine.

10:01.915 --> 10:04.373
Have a good day.
Thanks.

10:20.415 --> 10:22.748
Woman: Oh! Again!

10:22.748 --> 10:23.748
Woman:
Yes!

10:43.581 --> 10:46.415
Woman: Yeah.

10:51.707 --> 10:52.748
Woman:
Oh! Harder!

10:55.415 --> 10:58.456
Oh, it's still going on.
All right.

10:59.873 --> 11:00.915
So, uh...

11:01.873 --> 11:03.415
So, I'll see you tomorrow.

11:03.415 --> 11:04.873
Hey.
Hmm?

11:04.873 --> 11:06.123
Roadie?

11:07.998 --> 11:08.998
No.

11:18.331 --> 11:20.081
Hey, guys?

11:20.081 --> 11:23.123
Hey, hey. I just--
I just wanna, real quick,
say I'm really sorry

11:23.123 --> 11:25.456
I yelled at you guys last class.

11:25.456 --> 11:27.832
You guys
were just trying
to do the work,

11:27.832 --> 11:31.623
and I jumped
down your throats,
and, uh... I was wrong.

11:31.623 --> 11:34.248
No, listen, Bars.
We were talking,

11:34.248 --> 11:36.289
and... we're sorry.
Yeah.

11:36.289 --> 11:39.081
Yeah.
We all took a quiz.

11:39.081 --> 11:40.665
We were in a bubble.
You've been through

11:40.665 --> 11:42.873
something that we can't
possibly understand, Barry.

11:42.873 --> 11:46.248
Yeah, I've actually decided
to start reading books
about World War II.

11:46.248 --> 11:49.873
You're gonna be
an amazing Macbeth--
uh, Scottish king.

11:49.873 --> 11:51.456
Thanks, guys.
I appreciate that.

11:51.456 --> 11:53.331
Sasha:
Yeah. Yeah.
Thanks for understanding.

11:59.998 --> 12:01.289
All right.

12:01.289 --> 12:04.331
Who wants to bring
the Bard's words alive?

12:04.331 --> 12:06.456
Scripts out.

12:13.331 --> 12:14.331
Fuck.

12:24.373 --> 12:25.540
Fuck!

12:38.164 --> 12:40.331
Jermaine:
Oh. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Gimme a second.

12:40.331 --> 12:43.540
Jermaine:
Hey, B, I saw you, like,
rush out of the theater.

12:43.540 --> 12:45.123
Do you have IBS?

12:45.123 --> 12:46.707
'Cause, like, I have IBS.

12:46.707 --> 12:49.289
Barry, I'd actually like
to share my story with you.

12:49.289 --> 12:50.498
You know,
when I was 12 years--

12:50.498 --> 12:54.164
"Out, damned spot!

12:56.581 --> 12:58.581
Out, I say!"

13:03.039 --> 13:05.039
"Why, then,
'tis time to do't.

13:06.331 --> 13:07.915
I thought this was
Natalie's part.

13:07.915 --> 13:10.998
Yeah. I asked her.
She doesn't want
to talk about it.

13:17.248 --> 13:18.623
Do you mark that?

13:18.623 --> 13:21.248
Okay, Barry,
hold it before you
give yourself a hernia.

13:22.873 --> 13:24.123
What are you doing?

13:24.123 --> 13:26.373
Uh, I'm--
I'm saying my line.

13:26.373 --> 13:30.415
Yeah, and...
you're saying
the hell out of it, too.

13:30.415 --> 13:32.164
Except, we're not sayers.

13:32.164 --> 13:33.957
We're studying
to be actors.
Right.

13:33.957 --> 13:35.665
Where's Lady Macbeth?

13:35.665 --> 13:36.915
She's right there.

13:36.915 --> 13:39.373
She's so close.
What is she doing?

13:39.373 --> 13:41.123
Sh-- she's sleepwalking.

13:41.123 --> 13:42.748
Gene:
Do you wanna wake her?
No.

13:42.748 --> 13:44.790
So, my thought
is your guy

13:44.790 --> 13:47.164
would probably
talk like this,

13:47.164 --> 13:49.790
and not talk like this,
for Christ's sake!

13:49.790 --> 13:52.206
All right. Cool.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.790
So, quieter?
Or not. Or...

13:55.790 --> 13:58.623
This is not
a volume issue.

13:58.623 --> 14:00.748
This is an issue
of that you have decided

14:00.748 --> 14:02.998
how to do the scene
even before it started.

14:02.998 --> 14:05.331
You are not listening
to your acting partner.

14:05.331 --> 14:06.957
Thank you.
Stay outta this.

14:06.957 --> 14:08.957
I-- I feel like
I am listening,

14:08.957 --> 14:10.790
'cause that's why I know
when to say my lines.

14:10.790 --> 14:12.456
Yeah. Oh no,
that's called "waiting."

14:12.456 --> 14:14.456
Okay.
You're waiting.
You're not listening.

14:14.456 --> 14:17.164
Right.
You have to listen
to the attitude,

14:17.164 --> 14:21.373
to the tone, to the way
that it's being said to you.

14:21.373 --> 14:23.665
Wow. I keep forgetting
how strong you are.

14:23.665 --> 14:26.707
All right, you know what?
Both of you face each other
right now.

14:26.707 --> 14:29.039
We're gonna do
repetition exercises.

14:29.039 --> 14:30.415
You're gonna say
something to Sally,

14:30.415 --> 14:31.790
she's gonna repeat it
back to you,

14:31.790 --> 14:32.957
you're gonna say it
back to her.

14:32.957 --> 14:35.123
Now, the words
will stay the same,

14:35.123 --> 14:38.039
but you... will change.

14:38.039 --> 14:39.331
All right, go.

14:45.373 --> 14:46.665
What do I--
I don't know what to say.

14:46.665 --> 14:48.081
Do I-- I'm sorry.
Gene:
Okay.

14:48.081 --> 14:49.957
I guess I don't understand.
All right. Listen.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.164
Just listen and focus.
Okay.

14:52.164 --> 14:53.581
Something simple.
Mm-hmm.

14:53.581 --> 14:54.957
Just tell her
you love her.

15:03.748 --> 15:04.790
I love you.

15:05.832 --> 15:06.873
I love you?

15:11.331 --> 15:13.832
I love you.
Okay. Stop. All right.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.957
You're saying it
like you mean it.

15:16.957 --> 15:20.415
She's saying it like...
"Get the hell
outta here."

15:20.415 --> 15:23.748
You have to listen to the way
she's talking to you

15:23.748 --> 15:25.415
with her soul.

15:26.707 --> 15:27.748
Go.

15:32.415 --> 15:33.415
I love you.

15:35.790 --> 15:36.832
"I love you"?

15:39.081 --> 15:40.081
I love you?

15:41.039 --> 15:42.873
All right,
now, adapt.

15:42.873 --> 15:45.665
Adjust. Look at her.

15:46.540 --> 15:47.957
Barry: Uh-huh.
Gene: All right?

15:47.957 --> 15:51.707
It's hopeless, Barry.
Give it the fuck up.

15:56.248 --> 15:57.498
I love you.

16:00.456 --> 16:01.873
I love you.

16:06.164 --> 16:07.289
I love you.

16:07.289 --> 16:09.081
Gene:
Well, look who's
a good listener.

16:09.081 --> 16:10.873
You stuck your tail
between your legs,

16:10.873 --> 16:13.081
and you slunk off
like a beaten man.

16:13.081 --> 16:15.456
That's listening.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

16:16.373 --> 16:18.623
All right.
Thank you. Thank you.

Let me know when you want

16:35.915 --> 16:37.039

Have you killed Taylor yet?

16:41.373 --> 16:43.456
If you don't have
the stones to do it,
you better tell him

16:43.456 --> 16:44.707
to keep his fucking mouth shut

16:44.707 --> 16:46.623
or you'll stick

Taylor:
Hey, Barry,
it's Taylor.

16:50.206 --> 16:52.498
Forgot to tell you
I put a deposit down
on a hot tub.

16:52.498 --> 16:54.164
I figured
we could split it 50-50...

16:54.164 --> 16:56.415
What?
...so you owe me
1700 bucks.

16:56.415 --> 16:59.873
Fuck!
Also, you killed
Fuches yet?

17:06.498 --> 17:07.998
Hello.

17:07.998 --> 17:10.998
Hey, Taylor.
It's Barry, man.

17:10.998 --> 17:13.289
Listen, dude, you, um...

17:18.289 --> 17:19.498
You've been pretty amazing.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.957
Uh, really, really great,

17:21.957 --> 17:25.081
just an incredible energy,
and I felt like we had, like,

17:25.081 --> 17:28.832
an a amazing chemistry
at the stash house, you know?

17:28.832 --> 17:33.123
But this--
this plane thing is kind
of like a different vibe.

17:33.123 --> 17:34.665
Uh-huh.

17:34.665 --> 17:36.790
Barry:
And you know, I'm still
trying to figure it all out,

17:36.790 --> 17:39.540
but it seems to me,
that maybe, um,

17:39.540 --> 17:42.331
low-profile is the best way
to go with this one,

17:42.331 --> 17:47.540
so I-- I think I'm gonna
do this job solo.

17:49.665 --> 17:52.998
Okay.
Barry: It is no way
an indictment of your ideas,

17:52.998 --> 17:56.456
by the way,
like that amazing
bum-rush pitch,

17:56.456 --> 17:58.957
which was so inspired, dude.

17:58.957 --> 18:01.164
Really, really inspired. Um...

18:02.748 --> 18:04.581
You haven't told anybody
about this, have you?

18:04.581 --> 18:07.456
Nope.
I don't know why
I just asked you that.

18:07.456 --> 18:10.206
Big, professional dude
like you.

18:10.206 --> 18:13.164
So, yeah, I'm gonna
do it by myself,

18:13.164 --> 18:15.373
and you're not coming,

18:15.373 --> 18:19.164
and it's gonna be--
it's gonna be a thing...

18:19.164 --> 18:20.540
that I do by myself.

18:20.540 --> 18:22.832
Girl :
If you make one more move--
Uh-huh.

18:31.123 --> 18:33.206
Loach: Hey, so, like,
are we allowed to park

18:33.206 --> 18:35.707
in that outer lot?
That one's over--

18:35.707 --> 18:37.915
I've been parking
over there and I--

18:37.915 --> 18:40.498
I'm not sure
if we're supposed
to be doing that or not.

18:41.373 --> 18:42.998
There's no sign
or anything.

18:42.998 --> 18:44.415
Well...

18:51.206 --> 18:53.331
Hallelujah.

18:53.331 --> 18:54.790
She saw the light.

18:56.665 --> 18:58.039
How about that?

19:05.331 --> 19:07.415
Come in.

19:07.415 --> 19:09.164
Okay. I have an idea,

19:09.164 --> 19:10.832
and it might
just be brilliant.

19:10.832 --> 19:13.790
I'm listening.
Okay, you know how
my scene isn't working?

19:15.415 --> 19:18.498
I just took it
away from Natalie
and gave it to you.

19:18.498 --> 19:20.873
What else could
you possibly want?

19:20.873 --> 19:23.581
Debra Messing says
that you should only play
parts that scare you.

19:23.581 --> 19:27.081
I've played Lady M.
I need something more.

19:27.081 --> 19:29.123
I need something
that I can, you know...

19:29.123 --> 19:30.790
sink my teeth into.

19:30.790 --> 19:32.540
Yeah? Well, I am so sorry

19:32.540 --> 19:35.540
that Shakespeare's women
are not juicy enough for you.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.665
Gene: Who are
you dying to play?

19:41.206 --> 19:43.581
"To-morrow,
and to-morrow...

19:43.581 --> 19:45.623
and to-morrow."

19:47.790 --> 19:48.832
Are you serious?

19:48.832 --> 19:51.289
Yes! I am.
Not Lady Macbeth.

19:51.289 --> 19:53.123
Macbeth himself.
Act five, scene five.

19:53.123 --> 19:55.248
The whole enchilada?

19:55.248 --> 19:57.665
Mother of God.

20:11.832 --> 20:15.039
Do you know how many greats
have died on that hill?

20:15.039 --> 20:17.123
Orson Welles for one.
Oh, for God's sake!

20:17.123 --> 20:19.415
Lord Richard Harris.
The great Bert Lahr.

20:19.415 --> 20:21.873
Sally, this is reckless.

20:21.873 --> 20:25.164
Look, I just--
I-- I need to do
something drastic.

20:25.164 --> 20:26.957
Gene:
Why?

20:29.248 --> 20:31.456
Mike Hallman dropped me
as a client.

20:38.164 --> 20:40.331
What a turd
of a profession.

21:22.123 --> 21:23.498
You're gonna
have to nail this.

21:23.498 --> 21:24.873
I know.
We're talking perfection.

21:24.873 --> 21:27.289
I know.
But, Sally, you know
the expression.

21:27.289 --> 21:30.039
"You want to go fast,
go it alone.

21:30.039 --> 21:33.581
You want to go far,
go together."

21:33.581 --> 21:36.832
Why do you always insist
on going it alone?

21:36.832 --> 21:39.832
You and I both know
there is no one in
this class at my level.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.123
Be that as it may, Sally,

21:41.123 --> 21:42.832
not everything is
a monologue.

21:42.832 --> 21:44.748
The ensemble is there

21:44.748 --> 21:46.081
to help you shine.

21:46.081 --> 21:48.873
Gene.
I want this.

21:49.915 --> 21:51.206
I need this.

21:53.915 --> 21:54.915
All right.

21:56.581 --> 21:59.915
Hey, hey.
But Barry is
gonna play Seyton.

22:02.415 --> 22:03.832
Okay.

22:03.832 --> 22:06.456
Sally, it's one line.

22:06.456 --> 22:08.748
I'm sure you can eat
around that.

22:10.289 --> 22:12.123
