00:57.424 --> 00:59.625
How did we get here?

01:00.360 --> 01:01.860
What are you talking about?

01:01.862 --> 01:04.029

(CRYING)

01:14.341 --> 01:17.776
I wasn't asking literally,
I was trying to set a mood.

01:18.378 --> 01:19.711
What?

01:19.713 --> 01:21.580
Aw! How'd you do that?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.916
-Okay, I am going outside
to get a mystery.
-(CRYING CONTINUES)

01:23.918 --> 01:26.185
I put the knot in the wrong
end of the rope. God damn it.

01:26.187 --> 01:29.121
-YUNG: And I'm
not cleaning that.
-Oh, this is ridiculous.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.523
(HUMMING)

01:31.525 --> 01:33.559
Hey. Hey, who
turned off the gas?

01:33.561 --> 01:36.795
Oh, Pigeon, just take a
(BLEEP) damn anti-depressant
like the rest of us.

01:36.797 --> 01:40.699
Yeah, well, if any of you
were really my friends,
you'd let me die in peace.

01:40.701 --> 01:44.770
-Guys, listen...
-Hey, Pigeon, is that the guy
from <i> 9 to 5?</i>

01:44.772 --> 01:48.674
Yeah, Dabney Coleman.
I love Dabney Coleman.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.576
He's a reason
not to kill yourself.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.544
Didn't he pass away
a few years ago?

01:52.546 --> 01:55.247
What? I'm going back
in the oven.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.850
(GAS HISSING)

01:57.852 --> 02:02.654
Oh, wait a second, I'm
thinking of Charles Durning.
Dabney Coleman's still alive.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.693
We don't have
to tell him that.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.562
YUNG: Come on, let's go.

02:12.832 --> 02:15.968
Hold on. I have an hour
and 14 minutes on my movie.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.837
PIGEON: Nobody go through
my (beep) when I'm dead.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.308
Oh, hi, thank you
so much for coming.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.145
Oh, of course, ma'am.
We came as soon
as we got your note.

02:26.147 --> 02:29.681
We definitely didn't wait
an hour and 14 minutes.

02:29.683 --> 02:33.785
So, as I said, there is this
sound in my car and it's
driving me crazy.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.454
I can't figure out where it's
coming from

02:35.456 --> 02:37.556
and then, of course,
every time I take it
to the mechanic,

02:37.558 --> 02:38.991
it stops making the sound.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.225
-(BARKING)
-Ah! Look out!

02:40.227 --> 02:41.293
What the (BLEEP)!

02:41.295 --> 02:43.896
Sherman, no! No, Sherman!

02:43.898 --> 02:46.698
-I'm so sorry.
He's out of control!
-(GROWLING)

02:46.700 --> 02:48.600
Well, shall we take a look
at your car?

02:48.602 --> 02:50.602
That would be great.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.938
If you wanna come with me,
I'm about to take Sherman
to obedience school.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.873
And then I have to pick up
my two other kids.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.709
Wait a minute. You have two
more kids other than the two?

02:57.711 --> 03:02.748
Are you trying to tell me
that somebody (BLEEP)
you four times? Come on!

03:02.750 --> 03:04.249
-Pigeon!
-No offense.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.585
Oh. Okay, well, I'm sure
that smoothed it all over.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.888
-(WAILING)
-Oh, I'm sorry.
I have to change the baby.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.791
And then we'll go.
Would you mind watching Tyler?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.293
Watch him do what?

03:18.131 --> 03:19.698
What do you do, Tyler?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.701
Do you... Do you do magic?
Marquess does magic.

03:22.703 --> 03:26.138
Marquess, do that magic trick
you did this morning
for Tyler.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.173
I am not tying up
a 2-year-old.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.508
I'll do it.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.844
-No one is tying him up.
-Well, we're back
to square one.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.981
Your mom said to watch you,
but you don't do anything.

03:38.651 --> 03:40.185
Oh, that is low brow.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.988
It's funny as shit,
but it's low brow.

03:44.924 --> 03:47.526
Well, now that we don't
have to deal with
Sherman's barking,

03:47.528 --> 03:48.927
maybe, we can hear the sound.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.997
It's, um, it's kind of
this high-pitched sound.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.266
Oh, it's incredibly annoying.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.444
Well, this is why my husband
calls me a liar.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.579
(BABY COOING)

04:07.581 --> 04:10.082
So, Meg, what does
your husband do?

04:10.084 --> 04:13.218
He works in the IT department
for an alarm systems company.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.786
Oh, that sounds fun.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.755
(CHUCKLES)
How does that sound fun?

04:16.757 --> 04:20.225
I'm just making conversation.
You could ask her
something, you know.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.094
Oh, uh...

04:22.096 --> 04:24.529
Hey, Meg,
when you're on your period...

04:24.531 --> 04:25.964
Oh, my God.

04:25.966 --> 04:29.468
You don't even know
what I'm going to ask.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.604
Meg, when you're on your
period, do you still
like to get (BLEEP)?

04:32.606 --> 04:36.642
-(LAUGHING MISCHIEVOUSLY)
-I did know what
you were going to ask.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.148
Okay, you guys wait here.
I'm going to run in
and get Britney

04:43.150 --> 04:46.251
and then, we have to
drop her at gymnastics
before we pick up Miles.

04:48.588 --> 04:51.323
-Britney the gymnast, huh?
(CHUCKLES)
-Gross!

04:51.325 --> 04:53.859
-What?
-Dad, can you do something?

04:53.861 --> 04:55.727
Tell him not to talk
or something.

04:55.729 --> 04:59.598
I'm not allowed to say
"Britney the gymnast?"

04:59.600 --> 05:03.302
Hey, Pigeon, is that that same
guy from <i> On Golden Pond?</i>

05:03.304 --> 05:04.870
I don't know.
What are you watching?

05:04.872 --> 05:08.840
<i>Fast and the Furious 3.</i>
No wait, <i> Jaws 3.</i>

05:08.842 --> 05:10.642
No wait, <i> On Golden Pond.</i>

05:10.644 --> 05:13.011
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's the same guy.

05:15.148 --> 05:20.118
That balance beam
better get ready.

-Hi, Britney!
-Britney, this is the
Mike Tyson Mystery Team

05:23.357 --> 05:25.691
and they're going to help us
find the noise in the car.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.427
And I just found out that
Miles' soccer practice
was canceled.

05:28.429 --> 05:32.331
So now, we have to pick him up
at his school before
we can go to gymnastics.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.900
Mmm, I don't know when the
hell I'm gonna cook dinner!

05:34.902 --> 05:38.837
Hmm, there is no job
in the world harder
than being a mom.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.440
Really? Really?
How about a dad?

05:41.442 --> 05:46.278
Has to do the same stuff
as a mom, plus have a job.

05:46.280 --> 05:51.516

about it, I suppose so, uh...

that one out quietly.

for breakfast, okay?

going to lose my mind.

It's okay, ma'am. Let's take
the car out on the freeway

06:47.107 --> 06:49.674
and we'll all be real quiet
and we'll all pay attention.

Everybody put away your
screens away.

watching a movie.

late for gymnastics.

-Is it "Kill all the kids"?
-What? No!

Why don't we take the children
in the Mystery Mobile

while Meg and Mike will take
this car out on the freeway
and listen for the noise?

Yes, that sounds like
a very good plan.

kill all the kids?
