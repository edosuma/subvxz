11:31.080 --> 11:32.120
And there's always,
like,

11:32.120 --> 11:35.040
a little stenciled acorn
left behind.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.500
-Hmm.
-It's funny.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.460
When I was little,
I kind of thought

11:40.460 --> 11:43.670
it was an actually fairy,
not a real person.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.540
Kids are dumb.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.790
She pretty much does
what you do.

11:51.790 --> 11:53.250
She helps people.

11:53.250 --> 11:56.500
Hm. Then I guess
she's pretty cool.

11:56.500 --> 12:00.330
You're like a lame version
of the Acorn Fairy.

12:00.330 --> 12:01.710
Psht.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.210
Some really mean dogs in here.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.170
My uncle helps people.

12:13.170 --> 12:19.120
He handed out money around town
and put up a local art show.

12:21.330 --> 12:23.790
And he bought computers
for the school.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.000
That was you?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.210
Uh, guilty as charged.

12:30.210 --> 12:31.540
That was
some pretty solid work.

12:31.540 --> 12:33.670
Thanks.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.120
Also, you dropped this.

12:37.250 --> 12:40.250
Well, I started helping people
'cause I got bored.

12:40.250 --> 12:43.580
I retired
and needed a hobby.

12:43.580 --> 12:47.290
But why don't you want
anyone to know who you are?

12:47.290 --> 12:50.330
'Cause people get weird
when you help them.

12:50.330 --> 12:53.790
They, uh -- they always feel
a need to repay you.

12:53.790 --> 12:57.500
-Mm.
-That's not what I want.

12:57.500 --> 13:02.250
All this Acorn Fairy crap came
from this mailbox I fixed once.

13:02.250 --> 13:05.380
I painted a little acorn on it
'cause I thought it was cute.

13:05.380 --> 13:09.380
-Aww.
-The Acorn Fairy was born.

13:09.380 --> 13:12.210
-Hello, there.
-Oh, Roscoe.

13:12.210 --> 13:14.620
I find strays
and foster them here.

13:14.620 --> 13:17.000
That sounds...cozy.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.290
Can't help myself.

13:18.290 --> 13:19.500
You know,
I nurse them back to health

13:19.500 --> 13:21.210
and find them
a good home.

13:21.210 --> 13:23.290
And how many dogs
do you have?

13:23.290 --> 13:26.880
Well, at the moment,
I only have seven.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.040
Well, that sounds like a good
amount for this Airstream.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.750
Ah, I wish
I could have more.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.420
I'd love to buy
the lot next door,

13:33.420 --> 13:35.960
put my own Animal Rescue
on it.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.620
But I don't have $60,000
lying around.

13:38.620 --> 13:41.380
-Ah, yeah.
-You should help her.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.540
You're right.
Yes, I should.

13:43.540 --> 13:46.250
As a little
professional courtesy.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.670
You got that kind of money?

13:47.670 --> 13:49.040
Um, well, no.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.920
Um, that's something
to consider.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.210
But I, um...

13:52.210 --> 13:54.790
Ow. God.

13:54.790 --> 13:58.120
That's -- Good point.
Um, I will, um --

13:58.120 --> 13:59.750
I'll think
of something.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.710
So big.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.120
Amy, Is that you?

14:04.120 --> 14:06.750
Wow. Simone. Hi.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.830
Um --
-Great to see you.

14:08.830 --> 14:10.040
I heard
you were in town.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.670

looks good on you.

Oh my God,
don't make that face.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.210
I...
I talked to Nate.

14:18.210 --> 14:19.670
He seems really happy,

14:19.670 --> 14:22.670
which makes me happy,
so...

14:22.670 --> 14:24.920
...can we just not be all weird
and awkward about it?

14:24.920 --> 14:28.000
Yes. Please.
That would be just so great.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.580
-Yay, normal people.

14:29.580 --> 14:32.170
Except I kind of want to
kill you right now

14:32.170 --> 14:33.500
'cause you look
exactly the same.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.580
Oh, come on, you look amazing.
What have you been up to?

14:36.580 --> 14:38.500
Actually...

14:38.500 --> 14:41.120
Wow. That's...

14:41.120 --> 14:43.540
-It's fast, I know. It's just...
-No. I mean, whatever.

14:43.540 --> 14:45.290
I mean, it's faster
than I planned.

14:45.290 --> 14:47.500
I mean, so is being pregnant.

Wow.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.210

She believes body odor
should be savored.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.120
She --
she huffs canned air.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.120
Slowly, Tyler will see
all of her faults

18:21.120 --> 18:22.830
and then he'll eventually
want to break up with her

18:22.830 --> 18:23.540

Mm-hmm.

19:09.460 --> 19:11.380
Thanks to this crowd-funding
page I just set up,

19:11.380 --> 19:13.920
now anyone can donate

19:13.920 --> 19:15.330
And as soon
as the news airs,

19:15.330 --> 19:18.040
everyone will want to send
cash money

19:18.040 --> 19:20.000

19:20.000 --> 19:21.670
That just might work.

19:21.670 --> 19:22.920
It will.

anonymous.

Now, where are we

19:29.040 --> 19:31.380

-Mm-hmm.

how are things?

Eh. She's going through a bit

19:44.710 --> 19:47.460
Oh. Do you want to
talk about it?

19:47.460 --> 19:49.960
Leslie is having some trouble
with immigration,

19:49.960 --> 19:52.000
so she can't enter the U.S.,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.290
and she says it might take years
to figure out.

19:55.290 --> 19:56.540
-Oh.
-So...

19:56.540 --> 20:00.330
That's --
Stupid government stuff.

20:00.330 --> 20:03.880
But maybe it's a blessing
in disguise, you know?

20:03.880 --> 20:07.040
Long-distance relationships

You're so right.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.080
Well.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.920
Feeling this bad must mean

20:13.920 --> 20:17.120
that there's something amazing
just right around the corner.

20:18.620 --> 20:20.120
-Yeah.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.330
Oh, that sucked.

20:24.330 --> 20:26.620
You did the right thing.
Now you can focus on Phoebe.

20:26.620 --> 20:29.380
You're doing good.
-Yeah. Yeah.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.080
So, I was out shopping
yesterday,

20:31.080 --> 20:32.210
and guess who
I ran into.

20:32.210 --> 20:34.750
Um, it could literally
be anyone.

20:34.750 --> 20:35.620
I need a hint.

20:35.620 --> 20:38.580
Mm. Okay.

20:38.580 --> 20:41.120
She is...
your ex-wife.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.790
Oh. All right.

20:43.790 --> 20:46.540
No. No, no.
Not, "Oh. All right."

20:46.540 --> 20:49.380
It was fine.
I told you, everyone is cool.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.830
Oh. Good. Glad to hear it.
Yeah, seriously.

20:51.830 --> 20:53.040
It wasn't even
a little bit awkward.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.580
Good. I mean,
I'd hoped it wouldn't be,

20:54.580 --> 20:56.040
but you never know.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.120
Well, it would be kind of weird
for her to be annoyed at us.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.620
Yeah, people can be weird
sometimes,

21:00.620 --> 21:02.500
but, you know,
I'm glad that's not the case.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.960
I mean, she's the one
who's getting married

21:03.960 --> 21:05.330
with a baby on the way,
right?

21:06.960 --> 21:08.420
Wait, what?

21:08.420 --> 21:10.920
Wait. I thought you --
I thought you talked to her.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.080
She didn't tell you?

21:12.080 --> 21:14.330
No, she didn't.

21:14.330 --> 21:15.580
Oh.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.040
Does that bother you?

21:19.040 --> 21:22.330
Oh. No. No, no, no.
I'm just...surprised, you know?

21:22.330 --> 21:24.080
Simone said
she never wanted kids.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.790
I was the one who did.

21:25.790 --> 21:27.330
It was a big thing
for us.

21:27.330 --> 21:31.620
Well...
do you want to have kids?

21:31.620 --> 21:33.960
We don't -- we don't have to
talk about that right now.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.380
Why?

21:35.380 --> 21:39.080
Because this is new.
It's fun. You know?

21:39.080 --> 21:40.420
The big stuff?
That can wait.

21:41.620 --> 21:43.250
Okay.

21:43.250 --> 21:45.460
Hurry, hurry.
You're gonna miss my surprise.

21:45.460 --> 21:46.500
Woman: ...including one
from Copeland,

21:46.500 --> 21:49.290
as firefighters quickly
put out the blaze.

21:49.290 --> 21:52.170
Look, I-I know that you --
you don't want to be rewarded

21:52.170 --> 21:55.380
for any of the good stuff
that you do, but, um, well --

21:55.380 --> 21:57.250
Oh. Here.

21:57.250 --> 22:00.170
We now go live
to Trotter Collins on location.

22:00.170 --> 22:02.420
-People all over the county

22:02.420 --> 22:05.460
know the story of the
Acorn Fairy, a local legend.

22:05.460 --> 22:08.290
One neighborhood man has
started a crowd-funding page

22:08.290 --> 22:11.540
to help the Acorn Fairy raise
money for an animal shelter.

22:11.540 --> 22:14.540
Was the shaka too much?
It just sort of felt right

22:14.540 --> 22:16.420
when the photo got taken,
so I went with it.

22:16.420 --> 22:19.420
Kevin,
you're really very sweet,

22:19.420 --> 22:21.170
but I wish you hadn't
have done this.

22:21.170 --> 22:22.620
Ah, it's fine.
We intended on
keeping her anonymous,

22:22.620 --> 22:24.670
But as we looked into
her identity,

22:24.670 --> 22:27.250
we soon began to realize
something was wrong.

22:27.250 --> 22:29.170
Very wrong.

22:29.170 --> 22:30.670
The Acorn Fairy is a woman

22:30.670 --> 22:33.460
who goes by the name
of Phoebe Powell.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.380
But much like the Acorn Fairy,

22:35.380 --> 22:37.620
this person
doesn't really exist.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.330
So we did a little digging

22:39.330 --> 22:41.750
and uncovered
the real Phoebe Powell.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.710
Meet Francine Kronk.

22:43.710 --> 22:46.040
Ms. Kronk is a fugitive
from the law

22:46.040 --> 22:47.710
who created a fake identity

22:47.710 --> 22:51.170
to escape embezzlement charges
many years ago.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.750
What started
as a feel-good story

22:53.750 --> 22:57.000
will hopefully end in justice
finally being served.

22:59.210 --> 23:00.080
That's -- that's here.

23:02.670 --> 23:04.500
Do not open that door.

23:09.380 --> 23:10.710
Um, Phoebe --
I need you
to do something for me.

23:10.710 --> 23:12.040
Okay.
Make sure my dogs
are taken care of.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.120
Can you do that?
-Uh, yeah. Yeah. I guess.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.670
-Thanks.
-Phoebe, th-- they're --

23:15.670 --> 23:18.420
uh, they were saying
that you embezzled money?

23:18.420 --> 23:21.580
I did. A long time ago.
$100,000.

23:21.580 --> 23:23.750
What

23:23.750 --> 23:26.000
Because I could.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.080
I told myself
it was corporate money,

23:28.080 --> 23:29.920
that nobody
would get hurt.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.920
I -- Wait. Wait.
Can we just talk about this?

23:32.920 --> 23:34.920
Please, can we just
talk about this?
Trotter: Ms. Kronk!

23:34.920 --> 23:36.920
There's nothing to talk about.
I'm not a good person, Kevin.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.380
I'm sorry.
-This is Trotter Collins.

23:38.380 --> 23:40.250
I need you to do
one last thing for me.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.170
-Okay.
-Distract them till I'm gone.

23:46.790 --> 23:49.750
Uh, hey, ho!

23:51.250 --> 23:54.210
Williamson County Sheriff.
Let me see your hands.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.670
Man: Ma'am, stay there.

24:03.380 --> 24:04.460
This is really fun.

24:04.460 --> 24:06.040
-I agree.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.120
-Let me get you a refill.
-Hey.

24:09.420 --> 24:11.380
Thought we could get
the weirdness out the way

24:11.380 --> 24:13.380
so we can enjoy the party
in peace.

24:13.380 --> 24:15.330
Hey, Simone.

24:15.330 --> 24:16.420
Hey.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.960
You know what?
I will go get us those drinks.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.880
Simone, just a whole bunch
of tequila shots, right?

24:22.880 --> 24:24.380
Bring the bottle.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.790
Okay. But, uh --
but no. No, right?

24:27.790 --> 24:29.710
-I'm -- I'm good, thanks.
-Okay.

24:35.250 --> 24:36.790
Before you say anything,
I'm sorry.

24:36.790 --> 24:38.830
I should've told you
about the baby.

24:38.830 --> 24:42.040
It's just, I was excited,
and I blurted it out to Amy,

24:42.040 --> 24:43.420
but that wasn't cool.

24:43.420 --> 24:45.120
It's not a problem.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.580
I can see that.

24:46.580 --> 24:49.080
We don't have to talk
about this right now.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.710
Okay, now I know
you're upset.

24:50.710 --> 24:52.670
I'm just surprised,
Simone.

24:52.670 --> 24:54.170
You said
you didn't want to have kids.

24:54.170 --> 24:56.420
At the time,
that's how I felt.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.670
So you just
didn't want them with me.

24:58.670 --> 25:01.710
Nate, we hardly talked
about kids.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.710
I said I didn't want any,
and you said what you always say

25:04.710 --> 25:06.750
whenever a big issue comes up --
what you're still saying --

25:06.750 --> 25:08.580
"We don't have to talk
about this right now."

25:08.580 --> 25:10.620
So we didn't.

25:10.620 --> 25:12.080
And you built up
so much resentment

25:12.080 --> 25:13.420
that pretty soon
we couldn't talk about it.

25:16.250 --> 25:19.670
Look, I'm sorry
you're hurt, but...

25:19.670 --> 25:21.920
I think you have a chance
of being happy.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.000
Yeah.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.170
I do.

25:29.330 --> 25:31.500
Good.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.040
So stop talking to me,
and go talk to her.

25:39.790 --> 25:41.620
Tyler:
Greetings to my lovely lady.

25:41.620 --> 25:44.290
I wanted to respond
to your e-mail,

25:44.290 --> 25:47.000
but I felt adding a visual
component to our communiqué

25:47.000 --> 25:50.170
would help better express
my thoughts and feelings.

25:50.170 --> 25:53.210
I know that distance
and immigration law

25:53.210 --> 25:56.170
are conspiring
to keep us apart,

25:56.170 --> 25:59.330
but I have come up with
a perfect plan.

25:59.330 --> 26:01.540
This solves both those problems.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.120
Guys?

26:03.120 --> 26:08.250
♪♪

26:08.250 --> 26:09.710
My darling...

26:11.040 --> 26:12.080
Got it.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.540
Will you marry me?!

26:19.460 --> 26:21.330
So, are you gonna keep
your maiden name, or are you --

26:21.330 --> 26:22.460
-Kevin.
-Okay, okay.

26:22.460 --> 26:24.540
Okay, okay,
let's just, um...

26:24.540 --> 26:25.880
let's --
let's write Tyler,

26:25.880 --> 26:27.500
and then we have to get Phoebe
out of jail.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.670
You figure out freeing Phoebe.
I'll handle Tyler.

26:30.670 --> 26:32.540
You did this all wrong.
You were too easy on him.

26:32.540 --> 26:34.420
Just to be clear,

26:34.420 --> 26:36.500
the original cause
of this whole mess

26:36.500 --> 26:37.750
was you dancing with him
in Laos.

26:39.290 --> 26:42.580
When I'm done, boy's gonna know
he's been dumped.

26:42.580 --> 26:44.290
What's the plan
for Phoebe?

26:44.290 --> 26:47.080
Um, back in New York,
I had clients

26:47.080 --> 26:48.920
who committed
way worse fraud than Phoebe,

26:48.920 --> 26:51.710
and they all called
Glenn Peyton.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.960
Slickest lawyer I know.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.620
So scary, but he's in your
corner, you cannot lose.

26:58.620 --> 26:59.540
Glenn Peyton.

26:59.540 --> 27:02.420
Glenn, hey,
it's Kevin Finn.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.290
Long time, buddy.
How are you?

27:05.620 --> 27:06.830
I was just wondering

27:06.830 --> 27:09.830
if I could get a little
legal advice from you.

27:09.830 --> 27:13.040
You've got to be kidding me.

27:13.040 --> 27:17.000
Uh...is this a bad time?
I can -- I can call back later.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.040
You piece of garbage.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.500
You ripped my father off for
a quarter of a million dollars,

27:21.500 --> 27:24.040
and you have the balls
to call me for advice?

27:24.040 --> 27:25.710
He blew his life savings

27:25.710 --> 27:28.120
and you just tell him,
"All investments have risks."

27:28.120 --> 27:30.460
He's living
in my house now.

27:30.460 --> 27:33.750
Glenn, I am --
I am so sorry.

27:33.750 --> 27:37.380
I-I --
I was awful back then.

27:37.380 --> 27:40.670
Back then?
It was eight months ago.

27:40.670 --> 27:42.710
If I could reach through
this phone right now,

27:42.710 --> 27:45.080
I'd choke you until your eyes
oozed out of your skull.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.250
Okay, but you
have to believe me.

27:48.250 --> 27:51.040
I'm -- I'm not the same guy.
I...

27:51.040 --> 27:54.210
Finn, you will always be
that guy.

27:54.210 --> 27:56.080
Burn in hell.

28:01.620 --> 28:03.290
So, this might be
a little harder than I thought.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.330
Dear Tyler...

28:09.330 --> 28:14.330
Firstly, I want you to know
that you are the purest soul

28:14.330 --> 28:16.880
I've ever met
on God's green Earth,

28:16.880 --> 28:21.080
and I never,
never want you to change that.

28:21.080 --> 28:27.040
But -- but this -- whatever this
is between us has to stop.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.120
The truth is...

28:32.290 --> 28:34.540
I'm dying.
I'm into women.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.420
I'm a serial killer.
I snore.

28:36.420 --> 28:37.830
Okay, okay. Right, right,
right, right, right.

28:37.830 --> 28:41.920
Just -- just --
just say the truth.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.380
The truth is

28:50.380 --> 28:54.290
there is someone else
in my life...

28:57.750 --> 29:03.710
...someone to whom I have
committed myself entirely...

29:05.790 --> 29:14.210
...and who requires all
of my attention and dedication.

29:14.210 --> 29:17.420
"So this is
my final goodbye."

29:19.040 --> 29:20.790
Then, it's over?

29:23.040 --> 29:24.580
I guess she got back
with her ex.

29:24.580 --> 29:26.380
Sounds pretty committed
to making it work.

29:27.670 --> 29:29.380
You all right?

29:29.380 --> 29:31.670
Oh, yeah, I'm great.

29:31.670 --> 29:33.460
What's with
the sunglasses?

29:33.460 --> 29:35.210
Oh, I've been crying
all this morning.

29:35.210 --> 29:36.620
Oh.

29:36.620 --> 29:40.420
But on the plus side,
my cheeks are rosy.

29:40.420 --> 29:42.120
Mm.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.170
Got to stay hydrated
so I can do more crying later.

29:45.580 --> 29:48.210
I'm sorry...

29:48.210 --> 29:49.830
that you're
going through this.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.170
Man, I-I -- really.

29:51.170 --> 29:53.040
This is not your fault.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.750
Y-you're the best, man.

29:58.210 --> 30:00.620
I know a lot of people
who would disagree with you.

30:02.080 --> 30:04.170
I'm one of them.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.170
I think you did it.

30:10.170 --> 30:13.250
He finally gave up his dream
of being with you.

30:13.250 --> 30:16.500
Had to. There was --
there was no other way.

30:16.500 --> 30:19.830
Yeah, I --
I made it worse.

30:19.830 --> 30:23.960
I let him believe he actually
had a chance with Leslie.

30:23.960 --> 30:25.580
You know, I thought --

30:25.580 --> 30:28.620
I thought I could erase all the
crappy things that I've done,

30:28.620 --> 30:32.120
but I guess deep down
I'm just gonna be that guy

30:32.120 --> 30:33.670
who makes everything worse.

30:33.670 --> 30:35.830
That's not true, Kevin.

30:35.830 --> 30:37.540
Well, look at Phoebe.

30:37.540 --> 30:40.920
I mean, she dedicated
her life to good,

30:40.920 --> 30:42.170
and it didn't matter.

30:42.170 --> 30:44.040
'Cause the past
always catches up with you.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.250
Hey.

30:52.250 --> 30:55.330
Can I leave this
for Phoebe?

30:55.330 --> 30:56.880
Leave it on the desk
with the rest.

30:56.880 --> 31:00.620
Half the town has come in
with food for the Acorn Fairy.

31:00.620 --> 31:02.960
Wow. Um...

31:02.960 --> 31:06.710
Ooh.
What'd you bring?

31:06.710 --> 31:07.920
Oh, uh, chicken.

31:09.420 --> 31:10.460
Eh.

31:17.420 --> 31:19.880
I really messed
everything up for her.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.620
Well, some people would say you
brought a fugitive to justice.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.330
Is that what you'd say?

31:24.330 --> 31:26.040
No.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.920
I keep telling myself
I'm not the guy I used to be,

31:30.920 --> 31:34.330
but, uh...I-I am.

31:34.330 --> 31:36.920
I mean,
for every good thing I do,

31:36.920 --> 31:39.710
something bad
seems to happen.

31:41.040 --> 31:44.120
Look, Kevin, if you want to
argue you used to be a creep,

31:44.120 --> 31:45.580
you were a creep.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.080
Great.
Thank you, Nate.

31:49.080 --> 31:52.040
But you've changed.
Just like Phoebe's changed.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.000
You learned
from your mistakes,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.290
and you did something
about it.

31:56.290 --> 31:58.620
That's better
than most people.

31:58.620 --> 32:01.460
Thanks, Nate.

32:01.460 --> 32:02.830
If you've got something
for the Acorn Fairy,

32:02.830 --> 32:04.250
leave it over there.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.710
Deputy. Deputy. Deputy.
Hydrangeas. Your favorite.

32:06.710 --> 32:08.210
Oh, nice.

32:08.210 --> 32:10.670
Man, people are really
coming out of the woodwork

32:10.670 --> 32:11.540
for this woman.

32:11.540 --> 32:13.620
She helped
a lot of folks.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.710
I know how to help her.

32:16.710 --> 32:18.500
Thank you, Nate.
Thank you.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.170
Ms. Kronk, you have been charged
with theft in the third degree,

32:27.170 --> 32:28.880
which carries a maximum sentence
of 10 years incarceration

32:28.880 --> 32:30.750
and a $10,000 fine.

32:30.750 --> 32:32.250
Have you discussed the charges
with your attorney?

32:33.710 --> 32:35.210
Yes, I have,
Your Honor.

32:35.210 --> 32:37.210
And are you ready
to enter a plea?

32:39.120 --> 32:41.000
-I'm guilty --
-I'm guilty, Your Honor.

32:43.790 --> 32:46.040
Is it...
are you...

32:46.040 --> 32:47.500
Is this a dramatic outburst?

32:47.500 --> 32:49.250
I've never had
a dramatic outburst.

32:49.250 --> 32:53.460
Your Honor,
um, my name is Kevin Finn.

32:53.460 --> 32:59.420
For years, I was a-a dishonest,
um, unethical, selfish person.

33:00.330 --> 33:05.210
I-I mislead decent people
for, uh -- for profit.

33:05.210 --> 33:08.500
But, uh, recently,
I...

33:08.500 --> 33:10.620
I was given
another chance --

33:10.620 --> 33:13.620
a chance to -- to --
to learn from my mistakes

33:13.620 --> 33:16.120
and to make
different choices,

33:16.120 --> 33:18.210
to try to be
a better person.

33:18.210 --> 33:19.710
And how is that
working for you?

33:21.500 --> 33:22.790
I mean...

33:25.620 --> 33:27.790
Well...

33:27.790 --> 33:37.000
Part of who I am today
is because of who I used to be.

33:39.710 --> 33:42.120
The two are inseparable.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.460
Francine Kronk
may have been a thief,

33:45.460 --> 33:47.330
but that's not all she is.

33:47.330 --> 33:51.880
She's also Phoebe Powell,
the Acorn Fairy,

33:51.880 --> 33:53.790
who has made the lives
of the people in this town

33:53.790 --> 33:55.790
just a little bit better.

33:55.790 --> 33:57.290
People like...

34:00.920 --> 34:04.040
This lovely woman replaced
both of my bicycle tires

34:04.040 --> 34:06.500
at a time
when funds were low.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.330
Or this young woman.

34:08.330 --> 34:11.080
Um, one night, the Acorn Fairy
place chicken wire

34:11.080 --> 34:12.750
around my tomato cages.

34:12.750 --> 34:16.960
It was the first year I didn't
have to kill a single squirrel.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.210
I have killed
so many squirrels.

34:21.250 --> 34:24.040
See patched my roof
while I was on vacation.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.540
It blew my mind.

34:25.540 --> 34:27.330
A-and some big tree roots

34:27.330 --> 34:28.830
tore up the sidewalk
in front of my house...

34:28.830 --> 34:30.120
Tomlinson: Wait.

34:30.120 --> 34:31.420
Can everyone
who is going to speak

34:31.420 --> 34:34.040
on behalf of Ms. Kronk
please rise.

34:36.710 --> 34:37.460
Thank you.

34:40.790 --> 34:43.580
This played out totally
different in my mind.

34:43.580 --> 34:46.080
Funny, I was positive
you'd end up here.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.540
Um...

34:49.540 --> 34:53.330
Uh, I am so sorry,
everyone.

34:53.330 --> 34:55.250
Um, looking back,

34:55.250 --> 34:58.250
the old-fashioned
courtroom moment,

34:58.250 --> 35:00.750
uh...
it wasn't the best play,

35:00.750 --> 35:02.540
but, uh --
but it was our only --

35:02.540 --> 35:03.830
it was our only option.

35:03.830 --> 35:07.330
Uh, you could've spoken
to the woman's lawyer.

35:08.830 --> 35:13.540
I supposed we -- we could've
spoken to Phoebe's attorney,

35:13.540 --> 35:17.420
but that's -- you know,
that's, uh -- that's hindsight.

35:17.420 --> 35:20.670
Again, I am super sorry.

35:20.670 --> 35:24.170
Uh, let's keep
our spirits...up.

35:24.170 --> 35:27.710
-Dude.
-Hey. Oh.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.170
-Ah, thanks.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.460
That was beautiful.

35:32.210 --> 35:34.120
I never in my life thought
I'd be held in contempt

35:34.120 --> 35:36.620
for a courtroom protest.

35:36.620 --> 35:38.080
You were a total badass
in there, man.

35:38.080 --> 35:39.750
Like a young
Bob Shapiro.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.500
Thank you, Tyler.

35:42.500 --> 35:46.120
Your speech, man.
Downright inspirational.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.330
Got me seeing things
in a whole new light.

35:48.330 --> 35:50.330
Really snapped me
out of my funk.

35:50.330 --> 35:52.540
That's good to hear.

35:52.540 --> 35:54.540
All right, listen up.
You're all free to go.

35:54.540 --> 35:56.080
We are?

35:56.080 --> 35:58.960
Judge Tomlinson just wanted
to send a message to everyone.

35:58.960 --> 36:01.170
Show of hands --
who here now knows

36:01.170 --> 36:03.580
that disrupting proceedings
in a court of law is wrong?

36:03.580 --> 36:04.580
-I know it's wrong.
-Me.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.080
-Right here.
-All right, then.

36:07.080 --> 36:09.420
Well, what about Phoebe?
What happened to her?

36:09.420 --> 36:12.330
We -- we didn't damage
her case, did we?

36:12.330 --> 36:14.080
The judge is gonna let
her lawyer plead this out.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.920
She'll get some community
service, probably house arrest.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.380
Then it worked?
It worked.

36:20.380 --> 36:22.620
We did it, everyone.
-No. No, you didn't.

36:22.620 --> 36:25.290
Again, reminder, everyone --
do not disrupt a court of law.

36:25.290 --> 36:27.040
Thank you.
-Right. Yeah.

36:31.080 --> 36:33.000
Mom. Mom!

36:33.000 --> 36:35.080
-Nate's here.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.540
Nate?
He's over an hour early.

36:37.540 --> 36:39.620
-I know.
-Nate. Hi.

36:39.620 --> 36:41.330
Reese, I'm in a robe.

36:41.330 --> 36:43.290
I'm, um -- well, I'm --
I'm in a robe.

36:43.290 --> 36:44.580
Sorry I'm early.

36:44.580 --> 36:47.290
I thought it would, uh,
give us a chance to talk.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.830
Okay.
About what?

36:50.830 --> 36:52.880
Anything.
I mean, we can talk about

36:52.880 --> 36:54.500
whether you'd ever
want to have another kid.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.920
We can talk about
how weird I've been

36:56.920 --> 36:58.960
about Simone's pregnancy

36:58.960 --> 37:02.380
and how that weirdness
made you feel awkward.

37:02.380 --> 37:05.040
Well, I mean, I-I didn't --
I didn't feel that awkward.

37:05.040 --> 37:08.290
I mean,
we can even talk about

37:08.290 --> 37:10.750
which member of One D. has
the most promising solo career.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.460
Zayn, obviously.

37:14.830 --> 37:15.830
Amy, I just...

37:17.750 --> 37:19.830
I just want this to work.

37:19.830 --> 37:22.750
And I know that means
having to communicate.

37:24.460 --> 37:26.420
Um...

37:26.420 --> 37:28.000
Okay.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.830
Well, I still have to blow-dry
my hair and get dressed.

37:30.830 --> 37:31.920
Not a problem.

37:34.790 --> 37:37.040
So, uh, what do you want
to talk about?

37:37.040 --> 37:38.250
You know, I really
want to get to the bottom

37:38.250 --> 37:39.880
of this One D. question.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.210
I mean, you said Zayn,
and I get that,

37:42.210 --> 37:46.040
but you said it so quickly,
like Harry Styles doesn't exist.

37:47.540 --> 37:48.710
I mean, does he?

37:52.710 --> 37:56.040
So, this is it?
They have you picking up trash?

37:56.040 --> 37:59.540
And weeding
and painting playgrounds

37:59.540 --> 38:02.920
and planting bushes
for 1,000 hours.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.420
It's awesome.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.750
And I get to do
what I've been doing for years.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.920
I almost feel guilty
about it.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.210
Listen, Phoebe, I'm --

38:14.210 --> 38:17.960
I'm sorry for sticking my nose
into your life.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.670
And I feel like
I killed the Acorn Fairy.

38:20.670 --> 38:22.580
Kevin, are you high?

38:22.580 --> 38:23.620
No.

38:23.620 --> 38:26.040
You did me a favor.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.960
No, what you said in court
was right.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.290
I was running from the law,

38:31.290 --> 38:33.580
but I was also running
from my past,

38:33.580 --> 38:35.750
and you helped me see
that I don't need to.

38:35.750 --> 38:38.960
I mean, you didn't kill
the Acorn Fairy.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.670
She's standing right here.

38:40.670 --> 38:42.790
Aw. That... Aw.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.500
Now, leave me alone. I got
a ton of garbage to pick up.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.170
Okay.
-People are disgusting.

38:49.170 --> 38:51.420
That is true.

Tyler?

Ow.

39:27.380 --> 39:28.420
Hey!

39:30.120 --> 39:33.330
Okay, so, um,
you were on a boat?

39:33.330 --> 39:36.000
Yeah. I think it was the same
boat from last time,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.170
but more importantly,
Tyler was there.

39:38.170 --> 39:39.750
-Mm-hmm.

39:39.750 --> 39:42.670
Okay, two egg omelettes.

39:42.670 --> 39:44.460
Where is he?

39:44.460 --> 39:46.710
Excuse me?
I'm still waiting on my toast.

39:46.710 --> 39:49.120
-It's on its way, hon.
-Uh, I've been waiting a while.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.710
Yeah, that's how toast works.
Focus on your bacon.

39:52.710 --> 39:54.540
Lucille,
have you seen Tyler?

39:54.540 --> 39:58.000
Don't mention that name to me
ever again.

40:00.330 --> 40:02.580
W

40:02.580 --> 40:06.000
Apparently he's
learning from his mistakes

40:06.000 --> 40:07.380
to be a new
and better man.

40:07.380 --> 40:09.960
-He quit.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.920
With no notice.
Right before the rush.

40:11.920 --> 40:14.500
Said something about how the old
Tyler would let love slip away,

40:14.500 --> 40:17.750
but the new Tyler decided to go
to Canada to fight for love.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.460
I don't know how, but...

40:21.460 --> 40:23.120
I'm pretty sure
this is your fault.

40:23.120 --> 40:28.830
Excuse me?
Ask me about your toast
one more time, please.

40:37.420 --> 40:39.460
He's looking for
Leslie Nielsen.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.420
We have to go find him.

40:41.420 --> 40:42.540
I have to tell Tyler
the truth.
