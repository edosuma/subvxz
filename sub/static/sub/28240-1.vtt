02:13.935 --> 02:15.335
What about you?

02:51.302 --> 02:53.467
Trick or treat!

02:53.469 --> 02:54.533
Come on!

06:48.269 --> 06:50.899
What? You don't like
constant sunshine?

06:50.901 --> 06:53.302
You know, mountains, beaches?

06:54.635 --> 06:56.566
I can get a nice tan for you.

06:59.534 --> 07:01.466
Uh, okay.

07:01.468 --> 07:03.235
What about, um...

07:03.767 --> 07:04.769
New York?

07:05.902 --> 07:07.336
Well, I'm not picky, Ash.

07:13.969 --> 07:15.601
Anywhere is better than here.

07:17.269 --> 07:19.699
Rotting corpse of Detroit.

07:19.701 --> 07:21.503
I'm serious.
As soon as school's out...

07:23.935 --> 07:26.865
Hmm, it's only been two days,

07:26.867 --> 07:29.169
but I... I miss you, too.

07:35.301 --> 07:37.799
I...

07:37.801 --> 07:40.536
I really, really like you, Ash,
you know that. I just...

07:44.268 --> 07:45.800
Don't pout.

07:45.802 --> 07:47.336
Just tell me
what time you're picking me up.

07:49.534 --> 07:50.535
Okay.

08:04.867 --> 08:08.666
Keep us from harm
and in one another's company,

08:08.668 --> 08:10.732
so that we may be there
for one another

08:10.734 --> 08:13.700
when there is a need
for comfort.

08:13.702 --> 08:17.499
We thank You, Lord,
for our health, for our faith.

08:17.501 --> 08:19.535
And we pray
for Your mercy and grace.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.669
Amen.

08:23.801 --> 08:24.801
Amen.

08:25.436 --> 08:26.435
Amen.

08:29.435 --> 08:31.303
Cool. Should we eat then?

08:34.902 --> 08:36.203
Is that an owl?

08:37.602 --> 08:38.602
What?

08:39.534 --> 08:41.433
Oh, yeah.

08:41.434 --> 08:42.535
Can I see it?

08:43.368 --> 08:44.700
Caleb.

08:44.702 --> 08:47.333
Awesome.

08:47.335 --> 08:48.902
You know, that's permanent,
right?

08:50.902 --> 08:52.600
What?

08:52.602 --> 08:53.566
I mean, the guy in the alley

08:53.568 --> 08:55.599
told me that it'll wash off
in two weeks.

08:55.601 --> 08:56.666
Well, shit.

08:56.668 --> 08:57.899
I mean, how am I gonna go
to cotillion like this?

08:57.901 --> 08:59.334
Language!

08:59.336 --> 09:00.736
You know what else is permanent?

09:01.801 --> 09:02.865
- Family.
- Family?

09:02.867 --> 09:04.800
Family.

09:04.802 --> 09:06.832
Morgan, you're our daughter,
and you always will be.

09:06.834 --> 09:09.432
Nothing can change that.

09:09.434 --> 09:10.967
Your mother is entitled
to show concerns

09:10.969 --> 09:13.666
about the decisions
you're making about your future.

09:13.668 --> 09:14.866
What affects you
affects all of us.

09:14.868 --> 09:17.533
Okay, James, can we just...
Can we just have breakfast?

09:17.535 --> 09:19.334
- Oh, yeah. Okay, all right.
- Okay? Um...

09:19.336 --> 09:21.299
Morgan, can you just pass
the eggs, please?

09:21.301 --> 09:22.366
Oh, yes. Yes, ma'am.

09:22.368 --> 09:23.935
Thank you so much.

09:27.301 --> 09:28.398
I'll get it.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.565
You sit.

09:57.269 --> 09:58.402
Who was it, Dad?

10:00.002 --> 10:02.836
Oh, it's just some dumb kids
playing a prank on us.

10:08.368 --> 10:12.366
"The air is cool,
the season is fall,

10:12.368 --> 10:14.702
soon, Halloween will come
to all."

10:24.501 --> 10:25.800
Is that a Boo?

10:25.802 --> 10:27.433
It's nothing, Caleb.

10:27.435 --> 10:30.267
Uh, nothing looks a hell lot
like a bag of candy.

10:30.269 --> 10:31.701
Let's just eat, okay?

10:34.602 --> 10:39.000
"The air is cool,
the season is fall,

10:39.002 --> 10:42.632
soon, Halloween will come
to all.

10:42.634 --> 10:44.432
Terror and horror,
spooks galore."

10:44.434 --> 10:45.498
Caleb.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.632
"Tricky witches
are at your door."

10:50.236 --> 10:52.799
"The spooks are looking
for things to do.

10:52.801 --> 10:55.599
In fact, one brought this Boo
to you.

10:55.601 --> 10:57.765
The excitement comes
and goes like you,

10:57.767 --> 10:59.769
copy this note and make it two.

11:01.401 --> 11:04.234
We'll all have smiles
upon our faces,

11:04.236 --> 11:06.967
no one will know who Booed
whose places.

11:06.969 --> 11:09.666
But Hallows' Eve
will sure be grand.

11:09.668 --> 11:12.799
Laugh along and follow the plan.

11:12.801 --> 11:15.732
If you fail to pass this Boo,

11:15.734 --> 11:17.835
the spooks will bring your past
to you."

11:24.001 --> 11:25.202
Are you finished?

11:26.667 --> 11:27.733
Yes, sir.

11:27.735 --> 11:29.632
Did you hear me
tell you to stop?

11:29.634 --> 11:31.466
Jesus! He's just messing around.

11:31.468 --> 11:32.800
- Gotta have some fun.
- Uh, no.

11:32.802 --> 11:33.999
It's paganism is what it is.

11:34.001 --> 11:35.699
We don't do Halloween
in this house.

11:35.701 --> 11:36.932
But...

11:36.934 --> 11:38.234
we have to.

11:38.236 --> 11:39.399
Excuse me?

11:39.401 --> 11:40.866
It's not a joke.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.203
It's not a prank.

11:43.268 --> 11:44.669
If you don't pass it along,

11:45.300 --> 11:46.932
uh...

11:46.934 --> 11:48.299
It's... it's a curse.

11:48.301 --> 11:49.533
Okay, James,

11:49.535 --> 11:50.799
could you just please just get
that damn thing out of here?

11:50.801 --> 11:52.299
- No. No, don't.
- It's okay.

11:52.301 --> 11:53.866
Sweetie, it's okay. It's okay.

11:53.868 --> 11:55.700
Dude, it's just
a stupid chain letter.

11:55.702 --> 11:57.865
That's something
for the neighborhood moms to do.

11:57.867 --> 12:00.265
There's this kid at school,
Gabe Dawson.

12:00.267 --> 12:02.432
His cousin got a Boo.

12:02.434 --> 12:04.566
When she didn't pass it along,

12:04.568 --> 12:05.999
she died in a bathtub.

12:07.301 --> 12:08.599
Hey!

12:08.601 --> 12:10.966
Morgan, that's not funny.

12:10.968 --> 12:13.933
And there was this,
this, this Vietnam vet,

12:13.935 --> 12:16.266
old guy in the 80s.

12:16.268 --> 12:17.399
All the kids hated him,

12:17.401 --> 12:21.266
so one year, they Booed him
as a joke.

12:21.268 --> 12:23.765
Ghost stories, Caleb.

12:23.767 --> 12:25.966
- But...
- No. No buts.

12:25.968 --> 12:27.565
Give it to me.

12:27.567 --> 12:28.832
That's it.

12:28.834 --> 12:29.935
And you're lighter.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.665
I don't have a lighter.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.298
Yes, you do. There's nothing
that goes on in this house

12:34.300 --> 12:35.633
that I don't know about.
Give it to me.

12:35.635 --> 12:36.733
- Let's go.
- Lighter?

12:36.735 --> 12:37.902
Yes, lighter!

12:41.534 --> 12:42.535
Oh, no!

12:47.969 --> 12:50.733
The only ghost is a Holy Ghost.

12:50.735 --> 12:52.765
The only curse
you need to worry about

12:52.767 --> 12:54.367
is when you take His name
in vain.

12:54.369 --> 12:55.501
Are we clear on that?

12:56.969 --> 12:59.566
I said, "Are we clear on that?"
Crystal?

12:59.568 --> 13:01.536
Crystal.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.201
Have a nice breakfast.

13:09.768 --> 13:11.502
Oh, James.

13:12.434 --> 13:14.398
Oh, god!

13:14.400 --> 13:15.701
Fucking nuts.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.366
<i>A house fire
on Detroit's West Side</i>

14:17.368 --> 14:19.600
<i>from last night's
Devil's Night activities</i>

14:19.602 --> 14:23.399
<i>is strongly suspected of having
been yet another case of arson.</i>

14:23.401 --> 14:25.865
<i>Now, according to police,
witnesses have told them</i>

14:25.867 --> 14:27.933
<i>that a group of teenagers
have been loitering,</i>

14:27.935 --> 14:30.332
<i>all afternoon
and into the evening,</i>

14:30.334 --> 14:32.532
<i>near the vacant houses
on Piedmont Street,</i>

14:32.534 --> 14:34.232
<i>in the city's
worn-down neighborhood</i>

14:34.234 --> 14:36.432
<i>between Tireman Avenue
and Joy Road.</i>

14:36.434 --> 14:38.799
<i>At approximately 11:15 p.m.,</i>

14:38.801 --> 14:41.933
<i>neighbors reported seeing smoke
billowing out of the attic</i>

14:41.935 --> 14:43.899
<i>with flames erupting thereafter.</i>

14:43.901 --> 14:45.200
<i>Now, some residents said</i>

14:45.202 --> 14:47.632
<i>they called the police
and fire officials promptly,</i>

14:47.634 --> 14:49.398
<i>but that neither
the fire department</i>

14:49.400 --> 14:50.865
<i>nor the police showed up until,</i>

14:50.867 --> 14:53.399
<i>well, after the fire
was out of control.</i>

14:53.401 --> 14:55.498
<i>So the rushing fires
of Devil's Night</i>

14:55.500 --> 14:59.865
<i>again continuing this sad
and dangerous tradition...</i>

15:36.535 --> 15:37.832
Okay.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.501
Yes.

15:50.834 --> 15:51.835
Okay.

15:52.601 --> 15:53.601
Yes.

15:54.335 --> 15:55.602
Yes, yes, yes.

16:13.868 --> 16:15.501
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

17:08.001 --> 17:09.769
It's just me
and you, Reggie.

17:32.368 --> 17:33.402
Reggie?

17:35.467 --> 17:36.502
What's wrong?

17:39.567 --> 17:40.768
I'm scared, too.

17:43.568 --> 17:44.569
Are you?

17:47.568 --> 17:48.899
What?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.365
Do you believe in...

17:55.635 --> 17:56.769
...ghosts?

18:39.767 --> 18:41.633
Boo!

18:43.368 --> 18:44.998
What are you doing?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.867
I think there is something
in our home.

18:47.701 --> 18:49.466
It felt like...

18:49.468 --> 18:52.999
I don't know,
like I was being watched.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.602
Yeah, I know exactly
what you mean.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.766
You do?

18:56.768 --> 18:58.931
Yeah. I don't appreciate it.

18:58.933 --> 19:00.635
You go. I'm trying to get ready.

20:49.234 --> 20:50.335
Okay.

20:51.866 --> 20:52.934
Okay.

22:19.367 --> 22:20.498
Where do you think
you're going?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.764
Oh, shit!

22:22.766 --> 22:25.800
Uh, I'm just gonna head out
and see Ash for a little bit.

22:26.367 --> 22:27.368
Nope.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.468
You're watching Caleb tonight.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.532
But why?

22:32.534 --> 22:34.934
You're not the only one
who has plans tonight, honey.

22:36.300 --> 22:37.765
You can go down
to the bar

22:37.767 --> 22:40.265
where everyone knows your name

22:40.267 --> 22:42.965
and drown your sorrows
any night of the week.

22:42.967 --> 22:46.368
Uh, I mean, looks like you got
enough here to do the job.

22:48.235 --> 22:50.764
It's Halloween. And whether
we celebrate it or not,

22:50.766 --> 22:53.765
it's a night where you just
still like go out and have fun.

22:53.767 --> 22:54.935
What about my fun?

22:56.367 --> 22:59.332
You already had yours, remember?

22:59.334 --> 23:00.700
And maybe
a little bit too much.

23:01.967 --> 23:03.765
You're looking at it.

23:03.767 --> 23:05.502
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:07.300 --> 23:08.599
I can do the math.

23:08.601 --> 23:10.764
Upstairs, now!

23:10.766 --> 23:12.435
You're not going
anywhere tonight.

23:12.967 --> 23:14.565
Or tomorrow.

23:14.567 --> 23:17.700
Or the day after that,
or the day after that!

23:34.767 --> 23:35.834
Run!

23:45.401 --> 23:47.401
Trick or treat!

23:59.934 --> 24:01.202
Bitch.

24:02.268 --> 24:03.469
You didn't hear that.

24:06.633 --> 24:07.999
I'm gonna head out, okay?

24:08.001 --> 24:09.269
See Ash for a little bit.

24:10.001 --> 24:12.266
What about the curse?

24:12.268 --> 24:14.931
What if it happens
and I'm here alone?

24:14.933 --> 24:16.965
There is no curse.

24:16.967 --> 24:18.932
Just some lame-ass superstition.

24:18.934 --> 24:20.498
You know, like, uh...

24:20.500 --> 24:21.902
Dad's religious bullshit.

24:22.968 --> 24:24.399
Morgan.

24:25.468 --> 24:27.768
All right, that's... that's him.
I gotta go, okay?

24:29.435 --> 24:32.532
Don't leave.

24:32.534 --> 24:34.599
You're the only one left.

24:34.601 --> 24:35.868
What are you talking about?

24:36.967 --> 24:38.831
Mom and Dad,

24:38.833 --> 24:40.731
they, they don't care anymore...

24:40.733 --> 24:42.634
about each other, about us.

24:43.633 --> 24:44.767
That's not true.

24:48.301 --> 24:49.568
You don't care either.

24:51.234 --> 24:52.665
Why are you doing this to me
right now?

24:52.667 --> 24:54.265
Look...

24:54.267 --> 24:55.665
I do care, okay?

24:55.667 --> 24:58.464
But I care about Ash as well.

24:58.466 --> 24:59.931
Let me go see him
for a few hours,

24:59.933 --> 25:02.765
and then you can, uh,
I don't know watch a movie,

25:02.767 --> 25:04.465
eat some candy.

25:04.467 --> 25:06.299
And, I don't know,
if the doorbell rings,

25:06.301 --> 25:07.800
maybe just don't answer it.

25:08.400 --> 25:09.401
Okay?

25:10.268 --> 25:11.268
Sure.

25:13.334 --> 25:14.497
Be brave, creep.

25:14.499 --> 25:16.699
It's like Freddy Krueger, right?

25:16.701 --> 25:18.535
Curses can't hurt you
if you aren't afraid of 'em.

25:22.566 --> 25:23.764
No.

25:24.833 --> 25:26.301
Morgan, you can't go!

25:56.634 --> 25:57.635
Ash?

26:01.700 --> 26:02.700
Ash?

26:05.234 --> 26:06.298
You know,
this hide-and-seek should...

26:06.300 --> 26:08.468
Oh, shit!

26:14.434 --> 26:16.635
- Are you serious?
- What?

26:17.499 --> 26:18.668
Come on, it was a joke.

26:20.566 --> 26:22.534
It's Halloween.

26:22.867 --> 26:23.868
Hey.

26:26.866 --> 26:29.233
Really?

26:29.235 --> 26:30.631
- I...
- I thought I'd be funny.

26:30.633 --> 26:31.698
It's not...

26:31.700 --> 26:33.664
It's not funny. It's funny
when I do it to Caleb.

26:33.666 --> 26:35.301
It's not funny
when you do it to me.

26:35.968 --> 26:37.599
Okay.

26:37.601 --> 26:39.831
Sorry, I just didn't think
you'd be such a pussy about it.

26:39.833 --> 26:41.233
Oh, okay.

26:41.235 --> 26:42.397
You're an asshole.

26:42.399 --> 26:43.898
- Thanks.
- Mm-mm.

26:47.268 --> 26:48.535
Sorry.

26:49.801 --> 26:51.598
It was a joke. I'm sorry.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.898
Jokes are funny.
That was something...

26:52.900 --> 26:54.400
- Oh!
- Okay.

27:02.367 --> 27:04.431
Come on, I was joking.

27:04.433 --> 27:05.500
Okay.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.400
Hey.

28:08.766 --> 28:09.801
Baby.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.564
Come on.

28:13.566 --> 28:14.767
You still pissed at me?

28:20.434 --> 28:21.433
Morgan.

28:24.767 --> 28:25.868
No, Ash.

28:27.001 --> 28:28.535
I'm not pissed at you.

28:29.533 --> 28:30.767
You know me. I'm...

28:31.800 --> 28:33.367
pissed at everyone.

28:34.633 --> 28:36.567
Okay, well...

28:37.934 --> 28:39.735
Well, let's just go
and have some fun, okay?

30:15.800 --> 30:17.297
Trick or treat!

30:20.667 --> 30:22.268
Asshole!

31:23.334 --> 31:24.701
So you wanna talk to me now?

31:28.300 --> 31:29.835
Listen, I know something's up...

31:31.733 --> 31:34.297
'cause your ring
is dark as hell.

31:34.299 --> 31:35.300
Yeah.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.264
I'm no color expert,

31:38.266 --> 31:39.564
but I can only imagine

31:39.566 --> 31:41.233
pitch black
doesn't mean you're happy.

31:43.366 --> 31:45.668
Or... horny.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.268
Or whatever it is.

31:53.533 --> 31:54.767
I got the cure.

31:57.766 --> 32:00.664
Yeah, but it just cures
the sickness,

32:00.666 --> 32:02.464
not the disease.

32:02.466 --> 32:03.934
What? So you got a disease now?

32:06.633 --> 32:07.934
My family is.

32:09.634 --> 32:11.635
Uh, what are you talking about?

32:13.334 --> 32:15.732
I don't know, just...

32:15.734 --> 32:17.999
something Caleb said earlier,
I guess.

32:18.001 --> 32:18.801
Caleb?

32:20.867 --> 32:23.832
Mouthy little fucker.

32:23.834 --> 32:25.535
Yeah. He's a little fucker.

32:27.967 --> 32:29.699
But he...

32:29.701 --> 32:31.835
he notices things, you know?

32:36.266 --> 32:37.865
What about your mom?

32:37.867 --> 32:39.401
You know,
we never talk about her.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.233
Oh, 'cause she doesn't exist.

32:43.467 --> 32:44.535
Not anymore.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.434
That must be nice.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.798
What?

32:52.800 --> 32:54.631
No.

32:54.633 --> 32:56.298
No, trust me.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.568
Not having a mom sucks.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.634
I meant the non-existing.

33:04.367 --> 33:05.497
Don't.

33:05.499 --> 33:06.500
Okay.

33:07.333 --> 33:08.632
I mean it.

33:08.634 --> 33:10.532
Jesus, I was fucking joking.

33:10.534 --> 33:12.234
- I'm not!
- Phew.

33:13.866 --> 33:15.331
I love you.

33:17.766 --> 33:20.233
Oh, why does it bother you
so much when I say it?

33:21.299 --> 33:22.599
Means I'm not ready to say it.

33:22.601 --> 33:23.601
Then don't.

33:24.833 --> 33:25.964
I'm not forcing you to.

33:25.966 --> 33:28.632
We're just talking about me.

33:28.634 --> 33:30.601
Yeah, but it's not
just something you say.

33:30.999 --> 33:32.200
I know.

33:35.567 --> 33:37.201
It's something that you feel...

33:38.932 --> 33:40.367
for a while.

33:43.467 --> 33:44.668
And then you don't.

33:46.733 --> 33:47.768
And then...

33:48.567 --> 33:49.601
you're stuck.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.400
Yeah.

33:56.466 --> 33:57.467
I don't know.

34:00.234 --> 34:02.268
I mean, you're not thinking
like one day...

34:05.333 --> 34:06.432
I guess, I just shouldn't...

34:06.434 --> 34:08.500
I guess I just wouldn't mind
being stuck with you.

34:10.333 --> 34:11.567
Stupid, I know.

34:13.333 --> 34:16.600
Like would being stuck with me
be so bad.

34:19.632 --> 34:20.701
I just...

34:21.766 --> 34:23.467
I don't know. I...

34:24.666 --> 34:26.565
I gotta get out here.

34:26.567 --> 34:30.664
I can't take another four years
of this house, I swear to God,

34:30.666 --> 34:32.931
of Mom's drinking and...

34:32.933 --> 34:35.231
Dad's fire and brimstone shit.

34:35.233 --> 34:36.368
You'll get out.

34:38.567 --> 34:40.799
What if I just wasn't
good enough,

34:40.801 --> 34:42.431
like I don't get in anywhere...

34:42.433 --> 34:44.398
You worry too much, baby.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.831
Hey, did I ever...
Did I ever mention that to you?

34:48.367 --> 34:49.368
Maybe.

34:51.266 --> 34:54.764
You're so beautiful,
and you're smart.

34:54.766 --> 34:56.701
I'd be fucking lucky
to have you.

34:59.300 --> 35:02.467
Okay, what if, just for a night,

35:04.000 --> 35:05.568
let me tell you I love you.

35:07.267 --> 35:08.933
I mean,
not worrying about tomorrow.

35:10.933 --> 35:12.200
Or yesterday.

35:31.433 --> 35:33.964
Mom. Mom, it's Caleb.

35:33.966 --> 35:34.898
Can you just...

35:34.900 --> 35:36.900
Will you just come home
when you get this?

35:38.366 --> 35:41.232
Morgan's not here,
and, and I'm here alone.

35:41.234 --> 35:43.901
And, uh, I'm...
I'm really scared, Mom.

35:44.966 --> 35:46.398
I think there, uh...

35:46.400 --> 35:48.497
I think there's something here
with me.

35:48.499 --> 35:49.431
Mom, please.

35:49.433 --> 35:50.831
Please, just come home
when you get this.

35:50.833 --> 35:51.834
Please!

38:33.900 --> 38:35.531
Morgan.

38:35.533 --> 38:37.265
Where the hell are you?

38:37.267 --> 38:40.465
Caleb's alone, and you, missy...

38:40.467 --> 38:43.830
the second you get home,
you are in so much trouble.

38:43.832 --> 38:46.397
Whatever you did,
wherever you were,

38:46.399 --> 38:47.663
I hope it was worth it.

39:05.999 --> 39:07.201
James.

39:07.832 --> 39:09.365
<i>You okay?</i>

39:09.367 --> 39:11.497
Your daughter
snuck out again.

39:11.499 --> 39:12.798
I need you.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.498
I need you...

39:14.500 --> 39:15.766
<i>Where you at?</i>

39:17.700 --> 39:19.631
<i>Elyse?</i>

39:19.633 --> 39:20.931
<i>Elyse, are you there?</i>

39:20.933 --> 39:23.763
<i>Are you there?
Elyse, are you there?</i>

39:23.765 --> 39:25.300
- <i>Elyse?</i>
- Shit!

39:31.434 --> 39:33.464
Okay, question.

39:33.466 --> 39:34.901
So the "A" on your hand,

39:36.367 --> 39:37.568
can I ask you about it?

39:38.732 --> 39:40.298
You did already.

39:40.300 --> 39:41.800
No, you told me
to ask you again later.

39:43.966 --> 39:47.331
What? Goddamn!

39:47.333 --> 39:50.766
Like a fucking, you know,
Magic 8-Ball.

39:58.334 --> 40:00.301
It's this thing
that I use to...

40:03.832 --> 40:05.767
kinda remind myself that...

40:07.400 --> 40:10.633
I'm actually here,
and that it's not a dream.

40:11.434 --> 40:13.997
That this is real.

40:13.999 --> 40:15.534
You and I are real.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.333
Oh, so it's not...

40:19.500 --> 40:20.664
Mm-mm.

40:20.666 --> 40:21.730
- No.
- No?

40:21.732 --> 40:23.631
No.

40:23.633 --> 40:25.766
So I was thinking I was gonna
get an "M" right here.

40:27.434 --> 40:29.764
Like, uh, be like Joe Pesci
in <i>Home Alone.</i>

40:29.766 --> 40:30.830
Yeah, yeah, I mean...

40:30.832 --> 40:32.533
- Yeah?
- Sure, whatever.

40:36.732 --> 40:39.331
<i>Hey.</i>

40:39.333 --> 40:40.664
<i>You'll be okay.</i>

40:40.666 --> 40:41.964
What the fuck!

40:41.966 --> 40:43.730
What the fuck are you doing?

40:43.732 --> 40:45.598
- I need to go home, right now.
- It's all right.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.897
It's...

40:46.899 --> 40:47.933
What?

40:48.733 --> 40:50.298
It's fine.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.332
- I want to go home now!
- Are you...

40:51.334 --> 40:53.631
Okay, okay, okay.
Look, it's okay, it's real.

40:53.633 --> 40:54.498
Look at your hand.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.831
- I wanna go right now!
- Okay, let's go.

40:56.833 --> 40:57.897
Fuck.

40:57.899 --> 40:58.900
Morgan.

42:32.933 --> 42:35.730
"And if any mischief follow,

42:35.732 --> 42:37.998
thy shalt give a life
for a life,

42:38.000 --> 42:39.534
an eye for an eye,

42:40.432 --> 42:41.866
a tooth for a tooth."

42:44.299 --> 42:45.333
Oh.

43:08.565 --> 43:11.731
"A hand for a hand,
a foot for a foot,

43:11.733 --> 43:13.867
burning for burning,
wound for wound."

43:16.267 --> 43:17.400
What the...

44:19.799 --> 44:20.800
Shit!

44:24.433 --> 44:25.567
Ah, fuck!

44:25.967 --> 44:27.168
Shit.

44:48.699 --> 44:49.733
Reggie?

44:55.266 --> 44:56.267
Reggie!

45:03.298 --> 45:04.299
Reggie?

45:10.433 --> 45:13.297
Reggie, Reggie.

45:13.299 --> 45:14.633
What's wrong, baby?

45:15.866 --> 45:17.766
He died.

45:19.433 --> 45:20.533
Who?

45:22.433 --> 45:23.467
Reggie.

45:28.733 --> 45:31.168
It is happening.

45:33.799 --> 45:34.964
Nothing's happening.

45:34.966 --> 45:36.731
- No, no.
- I'm here.

45:36.733 --> 45:39.400
Okay, it's... It's the curse.

45:41.932 --> 45:43.633
It killed my fish.

45:45.432 --> 45:46.364
Honey.

45:46.366 --> 45:48.697
Goldfish die all the time.

45:48.699 --> 45:50.331
You know what?

45:50.333 --> 45:51.864
We'll get another one.

45:51.866 --> 45:52.867
I promise.

45:54.298 --> 45:55.466
I promise.

46:02.433 --> 46:05.464
Hey, you know what?
You know what, baby?

46:05.466 --> 46:08.264
Let's just...
Let's get to sleep.

46:08.266 --> 46:10.530
Let's just go.
Let's just get to sleep.

46:10.532 --> 46:11.533
Okay?

46:12.633 --> 46:14.631
Yeah, there we go.

46:14.633 --> 46:15.634
There we go.

46:16.732 --> 46:18.964
Here we go.

46:18.966 --> 46:21.733
Yeah. There you go, babe.

46:22.565 --> 46:23.566
Yeah.

46:24.699 --> 46:25.700
Okay.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.200
Snug like a bug in a rug.

46:37.632 --> 46:38.666
What?

46:41.599 --> 46:44.663
It's just that it's, um...

46:44.665 --> 46:48.731
It's been a long time
since you hugged me like that.

46:48.733 --> 46:50.763
When you were little,

46:50.765 --> 46:53.630
you used to get scared
and you would make me

46:53.632 --> 46:55.798
stay with you
until you fell asleep.

46:55.800 --> 46:56.800
Mm-hm.

46:57.632 --> 46:59.331
And I would...

46:59.333 --> 47:00.833
I would play in your hair.

47:03.332 --> 47:04.333
Oh.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.200
My beautiful baby.

47:09.332 --> 47:10.833
Now, close your eyes.

47:11.967 --> 47:13.233
Close 'em.

47:13.866 --> 47:14.830
Let's just go to sleep.

47:14.832 --> 47:17.400
It's been a long day
for everybody, right?

47:20.366 --> 47:22.297
The ghost...

47:22.299 --> 47:23.934
The ghosts are gonna get me.

47:25.232 --> 47:27.630
There's no such thing as ghosts.

47:27.632 --> 47:29.299
Ghosts aren't real, baby.

47:30.432 --> 47:34.432
You have nothing
to be afraid of, right?

47:36.366 --> 47:37.367
I guess.

47:40.366 --> 47:41.867
Sweet dreams, my love.

49:20.733 --> 49:22.233
I'm so...

49:22.932 --> 49:24.333
I'm so fucked up.

51:01.833 --> 51:02.834
Uh-huh.

51:03.565 --> 51:04.599
Where were you?

51:07.766 --> 51:08.932
<i>You have to.</i>

51:10.665 --> 51:12.633
<i>It's the only way
to make it stop.</i>

51:14.733 --> 51:15.933
<i>You'll be okay.</i>

51:19.265 --> 51:20.863
<i>You have to kill Elyse.</i>

51:20.865 --> 51:23.533
Okay, I know that you
are going through some things.

51:25.666 --> 51:28.266
But you can't just abandon him
like that, Morgan.

51:30.399 --> 51:31.866
He's 12 years old.

51:33.633 --> 51:35.797
When I was 12, I took care
of myself all the time.

51:42.533 --> 51:43.534
Hey, sweetie.

52:08.899 --> 52:10.200
I hate Halloween.

52:12.233 --> 52:13.866
It was a weird day.

52:17.799 --> 52:21.932
You scared Caleb earlier
with that poem stuff.

52:22.998 --> 52:24.330
I didn't write the damn thing.

52:24.332 --> 52:25.899
I know, but he's a kid, though.

52:27.298 --> 52:28.165
He needs to grow up.

52:32.233 --> 52:33.900
I don't know if I'm ready
for him to.

52:34.666 --> 52:35.699
Look at Morgan.

52:36.998 --> 52:39.331
She's growing up,
and I'm terrified.

52:39.333 --> 52:42.330
What happened to my little girl
who used to...

52:42.332 --> 52:43.798
pick wildflowers with me?

52:45.398 --> 52:47.929
Or... Oh, my god.

52:47.931 --> 52:50.865
Or used to want her toes painted
just like mine?

53:01.398 --> 53:03.296
You should talk to him.

53:03.298 --> 53:04.466
I think he's still up.

53:05.265 --> 53:06.266
I'm beat.

53:08.433 --> 53:09.700
I had a rough day, too.

53:23.733 --> 53:25.399
Son, you awake?

53:27.965 --> 53:29.600
Hey, what are you doing
with the light on?

53:29.965 --> 53:31.167
Reading.

53:34.966 --> 53:36.667
Mom says you're a little scared.

53:39.333 --> 53:40.333
Huh?

53:42.565 --> 53:43.929
It's okay.

53:43.931 --> 53:46.297
It's okay to be a little scared.

53:46.299 --> 53:48.830
What you don't wanna be
is too scared, all right?

53:48.832 --> 53:50.666
So scared
that you can't see straight.

53:52.599 --> 53:55.733
You gotta remember
God's got your back, always.

53:56.799 --> 53:58.564
That's why you are never scared?

53:58.566 --> 54:01.664
Oh, I am, on occasion.

54:01.666 --> 54:04.765
But when I was your age,
I was scared all the time.

54:05.499 --> 54:06.863
Of what?

54:06.865 --> 54:09.896
Um, this guy I knew.

54:09.898 --> 54:12.232
He used to chase me around.

54:14.633 --> 54:15.766
It was terrible.

54:17.865 --> 54:19.233
Take my lunch money.

54:20.498 --> 54:21.730
It was the worst.

54:21.732 --> 54:22.963
But as a kid, it was like

54:22.965 --> 54:24.566
that was the worst thing
in the world.

54:25.233 --> 54:27.363
One day,

54:27.365 --> 54:30.231
I was out by the lake,
I was out by myself.

54:30.233 --> 54:32.332
Setting off a box
of cherry bombs that I had.

54:33.533 --> 54:34.866
He started chasing me,

54:36.566 --> 54:37.797
going after those cherry bombs.

54:37.799 --> 54:39.563
Sent me like right up a tree.

54:39.565 --> 54:42.729
Literally up an old oak tree.

54:42.731 --> 54:46.732
I just sat up there watching him
hover below just like a shark.

54:48.532 --> 54:50.231
He was calling me names,

54:50.233 --> 54:53.634
and saying he was gonna do this
and that to me when I came down.

54:56.864 --> 54:59.798
So, what did you do?

55:01.233 --> 55:02.500
I got scared.

55:04.899 --> 55:05.963
Like really scared.

55:05.965 --> 55:08.798
I mean, so scared
I couldn't see right from wrong.

55:10.931 --> 55:13.796
I just... I mean...

55:13.798 --> 55:15.496
I started lighting
the cherry bombs off

55:15.498 --> 55:18.267
and dropping them
right on his head.

55:20.798 --> 55:22.167
So, what happened?

55:23.298 --> 55:25.929
Something I regret very much.

55:25.931 --> 55:29.832
So I'm trying to tell you, son,
fear, it's a dangerous thing.

55:31.865 --> 55:35.231
But aren't some things
worth being scared of?

55:35.233 --> 55:36.567
Some things, of course.

55:38.764 --> 55:39.932
Like the curse.

55:42.765 --> 55:44.433
Who told you
about the curse?

55:45.499 --> 55:46.797
Kids at school.

55:46.799 --> 55:50.397
They... they say there was this
guy, in the 80s.

55:50.399 --> 55:52.829
He got... He got a Boo.

55:52.831 --> 55:54.662
Yeah, Vietnam vet, right?

55:54.664 --> 55:55.866
Someone Booed him.

55:56.731 --> 55:57.964
He didn't pass it along.

55:57.966 --> 56:00.534
He said it was a prank,
like you did.

56:02.333 --> 56:03.996
That's not a true story, Caleb.

56:03.998 --> 56:05.299
It is true.

56:06.233 --> 56:08.233
Really? What was his name then?

56:09.698 --> 56:10.630
I don't know.

56:10.632 --> 56:13.364
I don't remember.
It was some city name.

56:13.366 --> 56:15.430
Uh, Memphis?

56:15.432 --> 56:16.896
Uh, I, I don't know.

56:16.898 --> 56:17.996
Yeah, Memphis. Uh-huh.

56:17.998 --> 56:19.630
Anyone know this Memphis?

56:19.632 --> 56:21.862
Or just friends of friends
of friends of friends?

56:21.864 --> 56:24.499
Son, that's something they call
"an urban legend."

56:25.932 --> 56:29.733
You believe in talking snakes,
God, angels.

56:32.533 --> 56:33.900
But you don't believe me.

56:34.865 --> 56:36.467
I have seen things, Dad.

56:37.432 --> 56:39.464
All right, you know what?

56:39.466 --> 56:41.267
We'll talk about this blasphemy
in the morning.

58:15.432 --> 58:16.499
Good boy, Torque.

59:25.832 --> 59:27.395
<i>Hey.</i>

59:27.397 --> 59:28.699
<i>Pick up the razor.</i>

59:32.299 --> 59:33.663
Okay.

59:36.631 --> 59:37.699
<i>Okay.</i>

59:38.397 --> 59:39.398
<i>Okay.</i>

59:43.266 --> 59:45.633
- Just do it, you fucking coward.
- <i>Just do it, you fucking coward.</i>

01:00:17.999 --> 01:00:19.763
<i>You stupid fucking bitch.</i>

01:00:19.765 --> 01:00:21.633
<i>Just fucking do it.</i>

01:00:24.432 --> 01:00:27.267
<i>Oh, just fucking...
Just fucking do it.</i>

01:00:27.699 --> 01:00:28.830
<i>Do it!</i>

01:00:42.699 --> 01:00:43.897
Fuck, fuck!

01:03:44.832 --> 01:03:45.900
Oh!

01:04:05.432 --> 01:04:07.833
Oh, James.

01:04:22.598 --> 01:04:24.495
Oh, shoot!

01:04:24.497 --> 01:04:26.730
Honey, you scared me.

01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:27.900
You couldn't sleep either?

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.432
I'm having bad dreams.

01:04:31.231 --> 01:04:32.231
Really?

01:04:34.331 --> 01:04:35.399
Me, too.

01:04:37.931 --> 01:04:39.198
Where is Papa?

01:04:40.332 --> 01:04:41.833
I don't know.
Downstairs, I think.

01:04:44.364 --> 01:04:45.365
So, um...

01:04:46.565 --> 01:04:47.896
Am I gonna get an apology,

01:04:47.898 --> 01:04:49.932
or we're just gonna pretend
like it never happened?

01:04:50.764 --> 01:04:51.832
For what?

01:04:53.631 --> 01:04:56.930
Okay, we're just gonna pretend
like it never happened.

01:04:56.932 --> 01:04:59.499
Girl, you're gonna be the death
of me, literally.

01:05:24.332 --> 01:05:25.432
What was that?

01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:38.399
What was that?

01:06:12.865 --> 01:06:16.466
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

01:06:17.232 --> 01:06:18.765
Thy kingdom come.

01:06:20.464 --> 01:06:23.265
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

01:06:26.331 --> 01:06:30.630
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

01:06:30.632 --> 01:06:34.597
as we forgive those
who trespassed against us,

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:39.896
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:06:39.898 --> 01:06:45.529
For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory

01:06:45.531 --> 01:06:49.866
forever and ever. Amen.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:08.566
It... It's here.

01:07:09.665 --> 01:07:11.630
- What?
- I told you.

01:07:11.632 --> 01:07:13.362
All we gotta do
is pass it along.

01:07:13.364 --> 01:07:16.765
It'll be fine,
but you didn't believe me.

01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:18.931
None of you did.

01:07:22.898 --> 01:07:23.963
I'm getting
a little tired of having

01:07:23.965 --> 01:07:25.796
this conversation with you.

01:07:25.798 --> 01:07:28.597
I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you,

01:07:28.599 --> 01:07:30.962
go upstairs and go to bed
before you wake everybody up.

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.996
Too late, we're up.

01:07:32.998 --> 01:07:34.732
I'm calling
a fucking family meeting.

01:07:37.231 --> 01:07:39.363
You can't call a family meeting.

01:07:39.365 --> 01:07:41.263
- You don't have the authority...
- Jesus Christ, James!

01:07:41.265 --> 01:07:43.696
It's not parliament.
We need to talk.

01:07:43.698 --> 01:07:44.895
We're not talking about this.

01:07:44.897 --> 01:07:45.996
There is no curse.

01:07:45.998 --> 01:07:47.529
Well, there's something.

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:48.863
We've all felt something.

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.830
Dad, we've been seeing things.

01:07:50.832 --> 01:07:52.529
Nightmares.

01:07:52.531 --> 01:07:54.529
You left your brother
alone, and he got scared.

01:07:54.531 --> 01:07:56.629
You felt guilty
and had a bad dream.

01:07:56.631 --> 01:07:57.699
It happens!

01:08:00.397 --> 01:08:04.895
We are haunted by our mistakes,
not by ghosts.

01:08:04.897 --> 01:08:06.798
Sometimes, they are the same.

01:08:08.532 --> 01:08:09.565
James?

01:08:11.532 --> 01:08:13.295
What did you see?

01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:14.929
Who says I saw anything?

01:08:14.931 --> 01:08:17.395
Okay, we may not
speak much anymore,

01:08:17.397 --> 01:08:19.563
but I've lived with you
for 20 years.

01:08:19.564 --> 01:08:21.895
I know when something
is upsetting you.

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:23.529
Really, Elyse?

01:08:23.531 --> 01:08:24.930
What was your first clue?

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:28.763
Yes, I am upset!

01:08:28.765 --> 01:08:31.229
Because none of you are...
are willing to put your trust

01:08:31.231 --> 01:08:34.328
and your faith into the Heavenly
Father or the earthly one.

01:08:34.331 --> 01:08:35.496
That is me!

01:08:35.497 --> 01:08:37.596
Here we go. The Good Book.

01:08:37.599 --> 01:08:39.328
We're a God-fearing family.

01:08:39.331 --> 01:08:41.930
I lost a child
in this house, James.

01:08:44.964 --> 01:08:46.365
A child!

01:08:50.265 --> 01:08:51.299
I know.

01:08:52.398 --> 01:08:56.495
A child
that we didn't expect, want.

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:59.796
And until that moment,
I didn't understand.

01:08:59.798 --> 01:09:01.029
You were down here
with the Good Book,

01:09:01.032 --> 01:09:05.299
I was upstairs in the bath,
my, my stomach tied in knots!

01:09:07.663 --> 01:09:09.995
That horrible minute.

01:09:09.997 --> 01:09:13.930
That horrible minute,
it's all I wanted in my life.

01:09:15.665 --> 01:09:17.166
And I wanted to come to you.

01:09:17.997 --> 01:09:21.295
I wanted you to be there for me.

01:09:21.296 --> 01:09:22.696
But you know why I didn't?

01:09:22.698 --> 01:09:24.662
'Cause I knew
what you would say.

01:09:24.665 --> 01:09:27.395
This is God's plan.

01:09:27.398 --> 01:09:29.662
Fuck God if that's His plan!

01:09:29.663 --> 01:09:31.330
I'm not gonna listen to this.

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:32.395
No. Of course, you're not.

01:09:32.398 --> 01:09:34.665
You don't hear anything
that you don't wanna hear.

01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:37.665
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

01:09:38.731 --> 01:09:40.529
I'm calling Ash and I'm leaving.

01:09:40.532 --> 01:09:42.929
The hell you are. You get
right back here and stay here.

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:45.733
Why? So you can give us
another sermon?

01:09:48.265 --> 01:09:50.962
She's right. You know,
that's all you ever do.

01:09:50.964 --> 01:09:52.662
You're gonna sit me down again,

01:09:52.663 --> 01:09:54.698
have a conversation
about the coward's way out?

01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:58.764
The only coward that I see here
is you.

01:10:00.232 --> 01:10:01.596
Too afraid to admit

01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:02.963
that there just might be
something wrong.

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:05.266
Goddamnit, this is my house!

01:10:05.998 --> 01:10:08.597
It is not safe anymore.

01:10:08.599 --> 01:10:10.995
Caleb, go upstairs
with your sister.

01:10:10.997 --> 01:10:13.465
Get your stuff, get my purse,

01:10:13.998 --> 01:10:15.199
we're leaving.

01:10:23.231 --> 01:10:25.198
Would you like to come with us?

01:10:26.298 --> 01:10:27.598
'Cause we're gonna go.

01:10:32.498 --> 01:10:33.861
Yes.

01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:35.962
Yes, yes, yes.

01:10:43.532 --> 01:10:44.566
Talk to me.

01:11:03.531 --> 01:11:04.632
Talk to me.

01:11:05.497 --> 01:11:06.665
Talk to me.

01:11:12.464 --> 01:11:13.466
Talk to me.

01:11:15.365 --> 01:11:16.398
Talk!

01:11:26.531 --> 01:11:27.931
Talk to me, talk to me.

01:11:28.763 --> 01:11:29.864
Talk.

01:11:31.364 --> 01:11:32.565
Talk to me!

01:11:34.365 --> 01:11:35.963
Talk!

01:11:39.797 --> 01:11:41.198
Talk!

01:11:46.564 --> 01:11:47.664
Talk!

01:11:51.897 --> 01:11:53.563
What was that?

01:11:54.997 --> 01:11:56.231
I don't know.

01:12:05.232 --> 01:12:07.429
It's locked.
It's locked!

01:12:07.431 --> 01:12:09.430
It won't turn.
The door's locked.

01:12:09.432 --> 01:12:10.963
What do you mean
it's locked?

01:12:10.965 --> 01:12:12.295
It's stuck.

01:12:12.297 --> 01:12:13.597
The handle won't even turn.

01:12:13.599 --> 01:12:14.665
Well, it can't just...

01:12:16.364 --> 01:12:18.231
That doesn't make any sense.

01:12:20.898 --> 01:12:21.932
Caleb's right.

01:12:22.864 --> 01:12:25.263
It's been after us all day.

01:12:25.265 --> 01:12:27.562
And now we're here all together.

01:12:27.564 --> 01:12:29.463
All right, listen.
You just need to relax.

01:12:29.465 --> 01:12:31.329
Calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:12:31.331 --> 01:12:32.395
I promise.

01:12:32.397 --> 01:12:33.831
James!

01:12:37.597 --> 01:12:38.697
What the fuck!

01:12:56.431 --> 01:12:57.798
Caleb, we gotta go!

01:13:06.398 --> 01:13:08.496
Torque! Torque!

01:13:08.498 --> 01:13:09.565
James.

01:13:10.398 --> 01:13:11.996
James, wake up.

01:13:11.998 --> 01:13:14.399
James. James.

01:13:15.364 --> 01:13:16.761
Are you okay?

01:13:16.763 --> 01:13:18.295
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:13:18.297 --> 01:13:20.565
- What the hell?
- You go get the kids!

01:13:21.432 --> 01:13:22.829
Go get the kids!

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:24.362
Okay.

01:13:24.364 --> 01:13:25.662
Okay.

01:13:25.664 --> 01:13:26.795
Okay.

01:14:05.264 --> 01:14:06.266
Caleb?

01:15:04.698 --> 01:15:05.698
Caleb.

01:15:13.931 --> 01:15:15.431
Caleb, where are you?

01:15:17.497 --> 01:15:18.498
Hello?

01:15:25.664 --> 01:15:26.798
Caleb?

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.266
Torque?

01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:38.898
Hey, buddy.

01:15:40.265 --> 01:15:41.332
Hey, Torque.

01:15:46.697 --> 01:15:47.697
Hey.

01:15:48.998 --> 01:15:50.266
Hey, buddy.

01:15:53.864 --> 01:15:54.932
Okay.

01:15:57.497 --> 01:15:58.762
I don't know
what to do.

01:15:58.764 --> 01:15:59.765
Please.

01:16:00.897 --> 01:16:02.331
Mom!

01:16:06.931 --> 01:16:07.932
Mom?

01:16:13.731 --> 01:16:14.798
Mom?

01:16:29.831 --> 01:16:30.864
Mom?

01:16:49.898 --> 01:16:51.266
What the fuck?

01:16:55.931 --> 01:16:57.532
Oh!

01:18:32.763 --> 01:18:34.931
Stop it. Stop! Damn it!

01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:41.796
God!

01:18:53.965 --> 01:18:55.395
Torque?

01:19:05.864 --> 01:19:09.629
Oh, family.
Family, oh, family.

01:19:09.631 --> 01:19:12.932
Oh, family. Family, oh, family.

01:19:22.864 --> 01:19:24.331
Honey, what are you doing?

01:19:25.231 --> 01:19:26.298
Morgan.

01:19:29.230 --> 01:19:30.494
Nothing can hurt you.

01:19:30.496 --> 01:19:31.764
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:19:33.497 --> 01:19:35.796
It's so cold.

01:19:35.798 --> 01:19:36.696
Okay, Morgan.

01:19:36.698 --> 01:19:39.598
I need you to get up
and come with me.

01:19:41.698 --> 01:19:44.429
You can't protect me.

01:19:44.431 --> 01:19:46.698
No one can hurt me again
if I do it to myself.

01:19:48.664 --> 01:19:50.528
I love you so much
and I'm so sorry

01:19:50.530 --> 01:19:51.861
I wasn't here for you
when you needed me,

01:19:51.863 --> 01:19:53.828
but I'm here now.

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:58.429
I'm here now,
for as long as we have.

01:19:58.431 --> 01:19:59.832
And I understand.

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:04.428
No, you don't.

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:05.898
Baby, just please, just...

01:20:06.998 --> 01:20:08.495
Just...

01:20:08.497 --> 01:20:10.262
Can you just talk
to me, please?

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:13.861
Please, just... Okay.
Baby, just, just...

01:20:13.863 --> 01:20:15.362
Just put down the knife.

01:20:15.364 --> 01:20:17.364
I promise.
I promise I'll listen.

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:37.397
What? You?

01:20:41.331 --> 01:20:42.431
Oh, no.

01:20:42.763 --> 01:20:44.465
No. No.

01:20:57.597 --> 01:20:58.795
An eye for an eye!

01:20:58.797 --> 01:21:00.395
An eye for an eye!

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:01.661
An eye for an eye!

01:21:01.663 --> 01:21:04.328
An eye for an eye!
An eye for an eye!

01:21:04.330 --> 01:21:06.862
An eye for an eye!
An eye for an eye!

01:21:06.864 --> 01:21:07.728
An eye for an eye!

01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:10.429
An eye for an eye!
An eye for an eye!

01:21:24.264 --> 01:21:25.497
Torque!

01:21:28.931 --> 01:21:30.431
Torque!

01:22:16.897 --> 01:22:19.561
James? James, are you down here?

01:22:19.563 --> 01:22:21.528
- Dad?
- I have Morgan.

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:23.230
- Do you have Caleb? James?
- Caleb!

01:22:23.764 --> 01:22:24.798
James?

01:22:25.630 --> 01:22:26.696
- Dad?
- James.

01:22:26.698 --> 01:22:29.328
Bring your past to you.

01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:32.262
The spooks, the spooks,
the spooks.

01:22:32.264 --> 01:22:35.562
The spooks will bring
your past to you.

01:22:35.564 --> 01:22:37.662
The spooks will bring
your past to you.

01:22:37.664 --> 01:22:39.796
The spooks will bring
your past to you.

01:22:39.798 --> 01:22:41.298
The spooks will bring your...

01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:44.528
James, it's Elyse.

01:22:44.530 --> 01:22:45.661
Morgan is here, she's with me.

01:22:45.663 --> 01:22:47.596
Hey, Dad. Hey. Hey.

01:22:47.598 --> 01:22:51.729
James, what's wrong? Look up.

01:22:51.731 --> 01:22:53.629
- Look at me.
- Dad?

01:22:53.631 --> 01:22:55.729
Whatever this thing is,

01:22:55.731 --> 01:22:56.995
I think we can beat it.

01:22:56.997 --> 01:22:58.461
Together, we can beat it.

01:22:58.463 --> 01:23:01.461
Dad, it's not real, okay?
We are real.

01:23:01.463 --> 01:23:03.764
Damn it, James, we need you.

01:23:04.863 --> 01:23:06.995
Dad, wake up.

01:23:06.997 --> 01:23:09.695
- Wake up!
- We are a family.

01:23:09.697 --> 01:23:12.398
We can get through this
as a family.

01:23:13.798 --> 01:23:15.828
Listen to me, okay?

01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:17.932
I... I need you to know that...

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:23.898
I love you so much, okay?

01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:26.329
Hey.

01:23:27.763 --> 01:23:29.797
Hey. It will be okay.

01:23:32.763 --> 01:23:34.297
I can see.

01:23:35.397 --> 01:23:36.695
My eyes.

01:23:36.697 --> 01:23:39.395
- They were... They were gone.
- No, it's okay.

01:23:39.397 --> 01:23:41.330
- They're back now, okay?
- I know.

01:23:46.664 --> 01:23:49.462
Caleb was right.
And so were you.

01:23:49.464 --> 01:23:50.565
It's just a dream.

01:23:52.264 --> 01:23:54.796
Caleb. On the boulevard.

01:23:54.798 --> 01:23:55.961
Where is he?

01:24:11.496 --> 01:24:12.498
Caleb?

01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:15.164
We were looking for you.

01:24:18.264 --> 01:24:19.564
You were right, son.

01:24:20.598 --> 01:24:22.862
We should have listened.

01:24:22.864 --> 01:24:23.927
We'll write down
the poem,

01:24:23.929 --> 01:24:26.328
and we'll pass it along.

01:24:26.330 --> 01:24:28.430
Just like what you said
in the first place, okay?

01:24:29.863 --> 01:24:30.897
Caleb?

01:24:32.797 --> 01:24:34.397
Caleb, what the hell
are you doing?

01:24:38.664 --> 01:24:39.862
- Oh!
- Caleb!

01:24:39.864 --> 01:24:41.394
- Caleb!
- Oh!

01:24:41.396 --> 01:24:44.731
Open up, Caleb!
Caleb, open the fucking door!

01:24:46.264 --> 01:24:47.529
- Caleb!
- Caleb!

01:24:47.531 --> 01:24:48.662
- Please, Caleb!
- Open the door!

01:24:48.664 --> 01:24:51.294
Please! Open the door!

01:24:51.296 --> 01:24:52.261
Caleb! Caleb!

01:24:52.263 --> 01:24:54.361
Open the fucking...
Open the door!

01:24:54.363 --> 01:24:55.428
Open the door!

01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:57.164
- Caleb!
- Please! Caleb!

01:24:59.464 --> 01:25:00.798
Open the door!

01:25:05.531 --> 01:25:07.228
Caleb!

01:25:07.230 --> 01:25:08.495
- Caleb!
- Caleb!

01:25:08.497 --> 01:25:09.829
- Oh!
- Caleb!

01:25:09.831 --> 01:25:11.632
Caleb, please!

01:25:12.831 --> 01:25:14.498
Caleb, please!
