01:53.208 --> 01:55.199
Welcome to Paradise!

01:58.208 --> 01:59.698
Relax.

01:59.709 --> 02:02.200
Come on, Sims, relax.

02:02.709 --> 02:04.745
Nobody saw you
get on the aircraft.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.741
And as far
as everybody's concerned,

02:06.750 --> 02:08.205
you're just still in the States.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.745
Hey, you're home free.

02:10.750 --> 02:11.739
Yeah.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.199
The police are probably
following me now.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.197
Not here.

02:16.750 --> 02:18.741
Relax. Come on,
it's cool.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.741
Right.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.206
Let's take a look at the goods.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.197
Ha, I've always wanted to see

02:23.208 --> 02:25.745
what $60 million
in diamonds looked like.

02:25.750 --> 02:27.741
$6 million is your share.

02:27.750 --> 02:28.739
I wouldn't cheat you, Catlin.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.240
You're an accountant, Sims.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.239
Figure it out.

02:44.792 --> 02:47.249
I trusted Daniel Sims.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.786
No one's blaming you, Senator.

02:48.792 --> 02:51.249
I'm blaming me!

02:51.250 --> 02:53.241
I was Chairman of
the Famine Aid Committee.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.241
That $60 million
was raised

02:55.792 --> 02:57.783
on my name,
my friends,

02:57.792 --> 02:59.783
my reputation.

02:59.792 --> 03:01.783
And it was stolen
by the man I hired.

03:01.792 --> 03:03.783
Daniel Sims.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.282
It's not my
reputation

03:05.291 --> 03:06.781
I care about,
MacGyver.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.783
What Catlin stole
isn't just dollars

03:08.792 --> 03:10.783
These people are dying today.

03:10.792 --> 03:13.784
That money was raised
to save human lives.

03:13.792 --> 03:16.283
When my daughter, Chris,
heard about it, she flew back

03:16.291 --> 03:17.781
from Africa.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.781
She's in the
Virgin Islands now.

03:19.792 --> 03:23.284
She's trying to find some way
to get to Catlin, but...

03:23.291 --> 03:25.282
nothing's worked.

03:25.291 --> 03:26.827
Nothing.

03:26.834 --> 03:29.826
Well, then,
I better get going.

03:48.834 --> 03:50.324
Here they come. Billy?

03:55.834 --> 03:56.823
Hi

04:01.834 --> 04:03.870
Your name MacGyver?

04:04.333 --> 04:05.869
That's amazing.
So is mine.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.324
You're MacGyver?

04:11.333 --> 04:12.869
Oh, sorry.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.332
I guess I was expecting
another high-powered lawyer

04:15.333 --> 04:16.322
or an ex-FBI agent

04:16.333 --> 04:18.870
with another great idea
that doesn't work...

04:18.875 --> 04:19.863
I..I'm sorry.

04:20.333 --> 04:21.322
I'm a little wound up.

04:21.333 --> 04:22.869
Chris Rhodes.

04:22.875 --> 04:23.864
Your father tells me

04:24.375 --> 04:25.364
you've been researching
things here.

04:25.375 --> 04:26.364
You can start by

04:26.375 --> 04:28.366
telling me what
you know about Catlin.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.366
He keeps what amounts
to a private army around here.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.366
Some of them arrived with him.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.366
He used to be a mercenary,

04:34.375 --> 04:35.364
soldier-of-fortune.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.366
Asia Minor, Libya.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.866
In Angola,
they call him The Butcher.

04:39.875 --> 04:41.866
Hey, Chris,
we're gonna get to him.

04:42.375 --> 04:45.367
Just what exactly do you do,
MacGyver?

04:45.375 --> 04:46.911
What else do you know
about Catlin?

04:47.375 --> 04:48.911
He came to the
Virgin Islan

04:48.917 --> 04:51.374
about five years ago
with a gaudy reputation

04:51.917 --> 04:52.906
and a lot of money

04:54.375 --> 04:57.367
With which he bought
this hotel and casino.

04:57.375 --> 05:00.913
Huh-- Catlin's
little hideaway.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.909
You don't like him much, do you?

05:14.917 --> 05:16.908
You know, I was in the
Peace Corps in Africa.

05:18.417 --> 05:21.409
I know what famine does.

05:22.417 --> 05:24.408
There he is.

05:24.417 --> 05:26.408
Welcome...

05:26.959 --> 05:29.416
to my little exhibition.

05:29.417 --> 05:31.408
That's Catlin.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.415
Come on
over, guys.

05:56.959 --> 05:57.948
Oh!

06:15.001 --> 06:17.447
We got a confirmation
from Amsterdam.

06:17.458 --> 06:18.994
They can handle the diamonds.

06:19.458 --> 06:20.447
All of them?

06:20.458 --> 06:24.497
$60 million to be paid
to a Swiss account.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.491
We need flight plans
and clearances.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.990
I want to be off this
island in 48 hours.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.489
See to it.

06:32.001 --> 06:33.491
He looks like
a happy guy.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.489
Why not?
We can't touch him.

06:36.001 --> 06:37.992
Maybe we can

06:39.500 --> 06:41.491
What if I were to
just to go in and...

06:44.000 --> 06:46.491
take the diamonds
from Catlin?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.492
My God, you're a thief!

06:50.500 --> 06:52.491
It's impossible!

06:52.500 --> 06:54.491
It's ridiculous!

06:54.500 --> 06:55.489
It's illegal.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.989
Why?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.491
Catlin claims
he doesn't have the diamonds.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.491
You tell me how taking something
that doesn't exist

07:01.500 --> 07:03.491
constitutes breaking
the law, hmm?

07:03.500 --> 07:05.536
Because we
can't just

07:06.542 --> 07:10.535
Well, because we...we can't
just plan a break-in,

07:10.542 --> 07:13.534
or...or pull off some kind
of far-fetched caper, or...

07:15.000 --> 07:16.991
You know,
you're right.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.536
What the hell!

07:18.542 --> 07:19.998
We'll do it!

07:20.000 --> 07:20.989
What you mean

07:21.000 --> 07:22.536
''we''?

07:22.542 --> 07:25.033
You were in the Peace Corps,
not the Green Berets, remember?

07:25.041 --> 07:26.531
Come on, what's your plan?

07:26.542 --> 07:28.032
I have found
from past experiences

07:28.041 --> 07:30.032
that the tighter your plan,
the more likely you are

07:30.542 --> 07:33.534
to run into something...
unpredictable.

07:34.041 --> 07:35.531
Okay.

07:36.041 --> 07:37.531
How, then?

07:39.041 --> 07:41.032
We fake it.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.032
Oh, great.

07:44.583 --> 07:45.572
Great!

07:45.583 --> 07:47.039
We are in deep trouble.

07:47.041 --> 07:49.032
Look, for starters,

07:49.583 --> 07:52.575
we're probably talking
about 200 pounds of diamonds.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.574
Now, where's
he gonna store that?

07:55.041 --> 07:56.577
Believe me, I know Catlin.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.577
He wouldn't trust
his own mother.

07:59.041 --> 08:00.030
Everything he has,

08:00.041 --> 08:01.577
he guards.

08:01.583 --> 08:03.039
So?

08:03.041 --> 08:05.578
So, I researched
all the construction permits

08:06.083 --> 08:08.074
on the casino.

08:08.083 --> 08:10.074
He built in two
security vaults--

08:10.083 --> 08:11.573
a big one in the casino

08:12.083 --> 08:14.074
and another one
in his private suite.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.072
Then that's where I'll start.

08:15.583 --> 08:16.572
Where do we begin?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.073
''I'' begin by getting a look

08:18.083 --> 08:20.074
at the inside
of that casino vault,

08:20.083 --> 08:22.074
see if the diamonds are there.

08:22.083 --> 08:25.075
I'll go in as a high roller.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.619
Start shootin' and see what...

08:26.625 --> 08:27.614
Catlin's casino is,

08:27.625 --> 08:30.082
well, frankly, dishonest.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.619
Nobody wins.

08:31.625 --> 08:35.072
The vault in the casino has got
to be guarded and locked,

08:35.082 --> 08:38.621
so the best way to get a look
at the inside is by invitation.

08:39.082 --> 08:42.075
So, I'll have to make sure
I win big at the crap table.

08:42.082 --> 08:44.119
Get them to store
my money in their vault.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.115
How can you be so sure
you'll win?

08:46.625 --> 08:48.616
I'll cheat.

09:03.625 --> 09:05.661
Not bad.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.658
You look like James Bond.

09:10.125 --> 09:12.116
I feel like...

09:12.125 --> 09:14.116
James Bond.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.157
I'm in disguise.

10:16.709 --> 10:17.698
Oh!

10:17.709 --> 10:19.199
Oh, I'm so sorry!

10:19.208 --> 10:21.199
You stupid
little fool!

10:21.208 --> 10:22.698
You spilled this drink
all over my dress!

10:22.709 --> 10:23.698
Nice lady.

10:23.709 --> 10:24.744
Do you know

10:25.208 --> 10:26.744
how much this costs?
I-I know.
I'm sorry.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.206
My husband gave it
to me for my birthday

10:28.208 --> 10:30.199
Should be right
to give me a proper diversion.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.197
I want to know
your name.

10:31.750 --> 10:32.739
I'd like to speak
to your supervisor.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.206
I'm so sorry. You're
absolutely right.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.744
It was my fault. It
was very clumsy of me

10:35.750 --> 10:37.741
When I was a kid,
the first time I went fishing,

10:37.750 --> 10:39.206
I had to jury rig my own line.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.197
This is an
absolute outrage.

10:40.750 --> 10:41.739
It worked.

10:41.750 --> 10:44.742
Caught a fish
that turned a lot of eyes.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.741
..So embarrassed
in my life...

10:47.250 --> 10:48.740
This catch should do
the same thing.

10:48.750 --> 10:49.739
This is absolutely
ridiculous!

10:50.250 --> 10:51.239
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.240
I'm soaking wet
in the middle of the casino.

10:53.250 --> 10:54.740
I mean, where is the manager?

10:54.750 --> 10:56.240
I... I want to talk
to somebody...

10:56.250 --> 10:58.241
I want this replaced!

10:58.250 --> 11:00.241
Oh. Oh.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.241
Excuse me.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.787
Oh! Oh! Oh!

11:08.792 --> 11:12.239
Oh. God! I...
Oh, God! Oh!

11:12.250 --> 11:13.239
What...

11:13.250 --> 11:15.787
What are you looking at?

12:24.333 --> 12:25.869
Winner, seven.

12:25.875 --> 12:26.864
Front line winner.

12:28.875 --> 12:29.864
Play come.

12:29.875 --> 12:30.864
Any craps

12:30.875 --> 12:32.331
Cut the seven.

12:32.333 --> 12:33.869
Again.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.866
Lucky seven,
11, any craps

12:39.875 --> 12:42.867
Number's up on the come-out.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.867
Comin' out.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.365
Cut to seven,

12:47.375 --> 12:49.366
bet the hard eight,
hard eight.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.366
Seven again.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.364
Pay the front line.

12:58.375 --> 12:59.865
Front seven shooter.

12:59.875 --> 13:00.864
Bet the front line.

13:01.375 --> 13:05.368
Bet the seven.
11, any craps

13:05.375 --> 13:06.911
Bet the hard eight.

13:07.375 --> 13:08.911
Let it ride.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.913
I've got this
afternoon's net
winnings figure.

13:17.917 --> 13:20.374
What is it, Jack?

13:20.917 --> 13:21.906
That's the one.

13:21.917 --> 13:25.409
Your Virgin Mary, sir.

13:25.417 --> 13:27.908
Oh. Thank you.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.908
Thank you,sir.

13:29.917 --> 13:31.407
You're welcome.

13:33.917 --> 13:35.908
Okay, here we go.

13:35.917 --> 13:37.908
Come on.

13:39.917 --> 13:41.908
Seven.

13:41.917 --> 13:44.408
Right here, bet
the front line.

13:44.417 --> 13:45.953
Any craps

13:45.959 --> 13:47.950
I want you to find out
who he is.

13:48.417 --> 13:49.953
My pleasure.

13:52.959 --> 13:55.951
Uh, we'll let
that ride again.

13:55.959 --> 13:57.950
Hi.

13:58.417 --> 13:59.953
I'm Tiffany.

13:59.959 --> 14:00.948
Bond.

14:02.959 --> 14:03.948
James Bond.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.447
Uh, again.

14:10.959 --> 14:11.948
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

14:11.959 --> 14:13.449
That's over our limit.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.449
Let it ride.

14:24.458 --> 14:25.447
Good luck.

14:25.458 --> 14:27.449
Somehow, I know you mean that.

14:38.001 --> 14:39.457
Would you like
to go again

14:39.458 --> 14:43.451
for the whole $130,000?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.991
Lucky dice.

14:53.001 --> 14:54.992
Let's see how lucky
you really are.

14:57.001 --> 14:58.491
Think I'll pass.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.491
Don't want
to be greedy.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.992
This table is closed,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.490
Thank you very much.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.489
Excuse me.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.489
I have to ask a favor.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.990
I'm going to feel
a little nervous

15:14.000 --> 15:14.989
walking around
with all

15:15.500 --> 15:17.991
of your money in my pockets.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.992
I assume
the casino has a vault?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.537
Not a very big
vault, is it?

15:25.542 --> 15:27.999
No, but big enough
to keep your money safe.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.991
until you're ready
to have another try

15:30.000 --> 15:30.989
at your luck,
Mr., uh...

15:31.542 --> 15:33.533
MacGyver.

15:33.542 --> 15:35.999
MacGyver.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.537
I haven't
seen you around.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.536
I haven't been around.

15:43.542 --> 15:46.033
So, Jack, it's been fun.

15:48.542 --> 15:50.032
I'll tell you, Jack,

15:50.041 --> 15:52.032
I've about had my fill
of the crap table.

15:52.542 --> 15:57.036
Mr. MacGyver,
you made six straight passes.

15:57.542 --> 16:00.033
The odds are against it.

16:00.041 --> 16:01.531
Yeah, that's why

16:01.542 --> 16:03.032
they call it gambling,
I guess.

16:03.041 --> 16:06.033
These dice are perfect.

16:06.041 --> 16:07.577
Yeah, you can say that again.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.030
Huh?

16:09.041 --> 16:12.579
Which is why we noticed...

16:12.583 --> 16:14.574
you've forgotten
your drink.

16:21.583 --> 16:24.575
Seven. The hard way.

16:26.083 --> 16:30.076
I'd like you to accompany
these gentlemen to my office.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.573
It's a little more private.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.074
Take him out.

16:34.583 --> 16:37.074
Well, Jack,
you've been terribly civil

16:37.083 --> 16:38.573
about this up until now.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.574
Why not?

16:48.083 --> 16:50.074
Oh! Oh, you clots.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.619
The least you could
do is help me up.

16:55.083 --> 16:56.619
All right, you,
hold it.

16:56.625 --> 16:58.081
Hold it, I said.

17:07.625 --> 17:08.614
This way!

17:36.125 --> 17:37.661
It's stuck

17:40.667 --> 17:41.656
Hold it! Get him!

17:47.166 --> 17:47.666
Think, MacGyver.

17:57.667 --> 17:58.656
Of course.

18:01.667 --> 18:04.158
Hey, MacGyver, what happened?

18:04.709 --> 18:06.165
The diamonds aren't
in the casino vault.

18:06.166 --> 18:07.702
They must be in
his private suite.

18:07.709 --> 18:09.165
Oh, great.

18:09.166 --> 18:10.702
I never said it was
going to be easy.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.155
How can you sleep?

18:25.709 --> 18:28.200
Usually, it's no problem.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.197
MacGyver....

18:34.208 --> 18:35.698
Come on, MacGyver.

18:36.709 --> 18:38.199
It was terrific.

18:38.709 --> 18:40.199
I mean last night.

18:40.208 --> 18:43.700
I was scared
and excited and...

18:43.709 --> 18:46.746
it's like all
the frustration just let go.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.206
Felt good, did it?

18:50.208 --> 18:52.745
Oh, felt great.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.744
More coffee?

19:05.250 --> 19:07.741
Uh, more coffee?

19:10.250 --> 19:11.239
Sure.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.741
That Catlin's suite?

19:15.750 --> 19:17.240
Mm-hmm,

19:17.250 --> 19:19.741
and the diamonds
must be in his vault.

19:19.750 --> 19:22.241
Well, I'll find 'em.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.241
Well, we don't have
to worry about Catlin--

19:24.250 --> 19:26.241
he's always on
the casino floor

19:26.250 --> 19:27.786
but last night
his security guard

19:27.792 --> 19:29.783
told me that Catlin
has a spy camera

19:29.792 --> 19:31.783
and an alarm system
covering the suite.

19:31.792 --> 19:34.249
Well, the guy figures
to be a little careful.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.787
MacGyver, there are
over 200 pounds

19:36.792 --> 19:38.248
of diamonds in there

19:38.792 --> 19:40.248
Even if you can
open the vault,

19:40.250 --> 19:41.786
getting the diamonds
out'll be impossible.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.786
Maybe.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.285
Maybe not.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.282
But the way I plan to do it,

19:48.792 --> 19:49.281
it's going to be kinda noisy,

19:49.792 --> 19:52.283
kind of, uh, public.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.282
You know what I mean?

19:54.291 --> 19:56.782
So I'm going to need
a major distraction.

19:56.792 --> 19:58.282
Small riot

19:58.291 --> 19:59.781
in the casino
would do just fine.

19:59.792 --> 20:02.784
You're going to cause
a riot in Catlin's casino?

20:03.291 --> 20:04.280
Oh, you bet.

20:04.291 --> 20:07.283
You can't possibly show
your face in there again.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.827
I won't.

20:08.834 --> 20:09.823
You will.

20:38.125 --> 20:41.117
I hope I can walk
with that thing in there.

20:43.125 --> 20:44.661
Just make sure you
get this magnet

20:44.667 --> 20:47.659
as close to the roulette
wheel as possible.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.662
Maybe I can hop.

21:09.166 --> 21:11.157
No, it'll be all right.

21:22.166 --> 21:25.704
What are you doing
with my ring?

21:25.709 --> 21:27.700
Give me your finger.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.165
Ooh, who am I supposed
to scratch?

21:34.166 --> 21:36.157
You're not going
to scratch anybody.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.702
Just like this when
you're playing blackjack.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.703
Oh, and then accuse them
of cheating.

21:42.709 --> 21:44.165
Yeah.

21:44.166 --> 21:46.703
Then you do the roulette,
the slots.

21:46.709 --> 21:49.701
But, Chris, you got to make sure
it comes together at 2:10 sharp.

22:06.208 --> 22:07.197
All right,
you remember,

22:07.208 --> 22:09.199
as soon as the diamonds
are in my car,

22:09.208 --> 22:11.199
you get in your car
and you go.

22:11.750 --> 22:12.739
I'll be right behind you.

22:13.208 --> 22:16.746
But it's got to come together
at 2:10 a.m. sharp,

22:16.750 --> 22:18.741
or we're history.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.206
I'll be here.
Good.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.199
MacGyver?

22:22.208 --> 22:24.199
Yeah... we're gonna make it.

24:29.875 --> 24:31.866
Now if Thomas Edison
is correct,

24:32.375 --> 24:34.866
at 2:10,
when these wires touch,

24:34.875 --> 24:37.366
all the slot machines
and lights in the casino

24:37.375 --> 24:38.865
oughtta go crazy.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.366
Excuse me

24:50.375 --> 24:52.366
Think this machine
will change my luck?

24:52.375 --> 24:54.366
Win some, lose some.

24:58.917 --> 25:00.908
Going to have to deal

25:01.375 --> 25:03.366
with that security camera
in the penthouse hall.

25:09.417 --> 25:11.908
The mirror from Chris' compact

25:11.917 --> 25:13.908
ought to show them
a thing or two.

25:42.417 --> 25:44.954
All bets down, please.

26:34.500 --> 26:40.496
All right, got to call
a little attention to myself.

26:40.500 --> 26:41.990
It should take
at least 80 seconds

26:42.001 --> 26:45.493
for the security people
to get up here.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.992
About enough time for me
to get into Catlin's.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.491
Maybe.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.490
Thomas?
Yeah.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.490
Some kind
of interference.

27:02.500 --> 27:03.990
Go check it out.

27:37.041 --> 27:38.531
Good evening.

27:39.041 --> 27:41.532
Is there
anything you need?

27:41.542 --> 27:46.582
I could use some luck...
right about now.

28:15.083 --> 28:16.573
Looks fine up here.

28:16.583 --> 28:18.574
Yeah, it's okay down here, too.

28:18.583 --> 28:21.074
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

28:22.083 --> 28:24.574
Thank you, madam.

28:25.083 --> 28:28.621
Place your bets,
please.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.082
All bets are down.

28:35.625 --> 28:37.616
Ten black-- the lady wins.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.616
Seems your luck is changing.

29:05.667 --> 29:07.658
Phew.

29:07.667 --> 29:09.658
Nasty habit.

31:28.792 --> 31:30.282
Catlin's private vault.

31:30.291 --> 31:31.781
Subtle little thing.

31:34.792 --> 31:36.783
Great.

31:36.792 --> 31:41.286
No combination, no lock,
no nothing.

31:41.792 --> 31:42.781
And you're no help.

31:51.291 --> 31:52.827
Maybe.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.825
Hey, Catlin, how
about bringing me

32:00.834 --> 32:02.290
some luck?

32:02.291 --> 32:04.282
I've already lost $30,000.

32:04.291 --> 32:06.828
Tonight, luck
is with the lady.

32:08.333 --> 32:09.823
It's the penthouse again.

32:09.834 --> 32:11.324
Get up there.
I'm on my way.

32:11.834 --> 32:12.823
I'll tell Mr. Catlin.

32:13.333 --> 32:16.325
Place your bets.
Round and round.

32:16.333 --> 32:17.322
All bets down now.

32:17.333 --> 32:18.322
Mr. Catlin,

32:18.834 --> 32:21.325
we have an intruder alarm
in your penthouse apartment.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.324
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

32:25.875 --> 32:27.331
Five black the winner.

32:42.875 --> 32:45.366
Looks good to me, Mr. Catlin.

32:45.375 --> 32:47.366
Something set
the alarm off.

32:50.375 --> 32:52.866
Which one of you idiots
left the bird cage open?

32:52.875 --> 32:54.365
God!

32:55.875 --> 32:57.866
Come on, sweetheart.

32:57.875 --> 33:00.366
Oh, that's a baby.

33:00.375 --> 33:01.865
Come on.

33:02.375 --> 33:03.865
There you go.
That's it.

33:03.875 --> 33:06.366
Yes. It's all right.

33:06.375 --> 33:09.367
Guess I'd better check
everything else while I'm here.

33:49.417 --> 33:52.409
What's the matter, sweetheart?

33:52.417 --> 33:54.408
Everything's secure.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.991
Thanks. I owe you for this.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.491
All bets down, please.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.491
Winner, number
seven black.

35:30.000 --> 35:30.989
Did you see that?

35:31.000 --> 35:32.536
Did you see that?

35:32.542 --> 35:33.531
Eleven red.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.991
That's why
I've been losing my money.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.537
Excuse me, sir, please.

35:38.542 --> 35:39.998
Let go of me.
Take it easy.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.536
This wheel is rigged.

35:41.542 --> 35:42.998
What a clip joint
you got here.

36:10.583 --> 36:12.039
You're right.

36:12.041 --> 36:14.578
It's an octave too high.

37:45.125 --> 37:47.161
And the name of the
game is blackjack.

37:47.667 --> 37:48.656
Bets, please.

37:57.166 --> 37:58.656
Excuse me, sir.

37:59.166 --> 38:01.657
Is there something
wrong with this card?

38:02.667 --> 38:03.656
She's right.

38:04.166 --> 38:05.702
This place
is a rip-off!

38:05.709 --> 38:06.164
These cards
are marked!

38:06.709 --> 38:07.698
Hey, we've been taken!

38:07.709 --> 38:08.698
What kind of
place is this?

38:08.709 --> 38:09.698
All these cards
are marked!

38:09.709 --> 38:11.165
I want my money back
-- every dime of it.

38:11.166 --> 38:13.157
500 bucks. And I want
to talk to the manager!

38:13.166 --> 38:14.155
Buzz off, bastard!

38:30.709 --> 38:32.199
Let go of me!
Take it easy.

38:32.208 --> 38:35.700
This is a horrible place!
Hey, take it easy,
take it easy now.

38:44.208 --> 38:47.200
Excuse me.

38:47.208 --> 38:49.199
I've got a bottle
of champagne on ice

38:49.208 --> 38:51.199
if you could wait.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.823
On that machine,

40:36.834 --> 40:37.823
was there
a pretty brunette?

40:39.834 --> 40:42.325
I just saw her leave.

40:42.333 --> 40:44.824
Come on!

40:53.875 --> 40:55.866
Over here. Come on.

41:54.417 --> 41:56.408
Hold on! Watch it!

41:58.417 --> 42:00.408
Come on!

42:17.417 --> 42:19.954
come on!
Out! Come on!

42:21.417 --> 42:24.409
I always knew you'd
be lucky for me.

42:31.458 --> 42:33.449
MacGyver?

42:33.959 --> 42:35.449
Yeah.

42:36.458 --> 42:38.449
It's me.

42:38.458 --> 42:39.948
Don't do what he tells you.

42:43.458 --> 42:46.450
I'll kill her
unless you do exactly as I say.

42:47.001 --> 42:48.992
I'm here.

42:49.001 --> 42:51.447
There's a small park
just near the breakwater.

42:52.001 --> 42:52.990
Oh, and MacGyver...

42:53.001 --> 42:54.992
don't forget
to bring the diamonds.

43:16.001 --> 43:16.990
Good morning.

43:19.500 --> 43:20.000
Where's Chris?

43:21.500 --> 43:23.991
Straight ahead.
Turn at the breakwater.

43:48.542 --> 43:50.999
Your lady's waiting
in the plane.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.036
Let go!

44:06.542 --> 44:07.531
MacGyver!

44:07.542 --> 44:09.032
See, MacGyver

44:09.041 --> 44:11.032
You wanted the girl...

44:11.041 --> 44:12.531
you got the girl.

44:14.041 --> 44:16.032
You gave him the diamonds?

44:16.041 --> 44:20.535
Ah, yes, our Mr. MacGyver
is quite the romantic.

44:20.542 --> 44:24.034
That's why... he loses

44:24.041 --> 44:26.032
and I win.

44:32.583 --> 44:34.039
Okay, let's
go up front.

44:34.041 --> 44:35.577
You two, come on

44:35.583 --> 44:36.572
Still got the ring?

44:37.041 --> 44:38.030
What?

44:38.041 --> 44:40.032
Oh, yeah.
Use it.

44:40.041 --> 44:42.578
You two! Inside!

44:45.583 --> 44:48.575
Get the jack out
of that trunk fast!

45:00.083 --> 45:02.074
Take it up
to 30,000 feet.

45:02.083 --> 45:04.074
The lack of oxygen
will kill 'em.

45:10.625 --> 45:11.614
I got an idea.

45:27.125 --> 45:28.615
All right, time to go.

45:28.625 --> 45:30.616
All right, all right!
I'm ready.

45:34.125 --> 45:35.615
I hope this thing works.

45:36.125 --> 45:38.116
Consider it a test drive.

45:38.125 --> 45:40.116
Now, get yourself down
and brace yourself.

45:40.125 --> 45:41.615
This could be fun!

45:41.625 --> 45:42.614
Oh!

45:48.125 --> 45:50.116
They should be
pretty docile by now.

46:34.709 --> 46:36.700
You can come up now.

46:50.709 --> 46:52.700
How you feeling?

46:57.709 --> 46:58.698
Great!

47:00.709 --> 47:01.698
Great!
