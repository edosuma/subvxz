00:44.628 --> 00:45.879
Hooray!

00:45.963 --> 00:49.550
Is Charlie Brown's dog
telling that story again?

00:49.633 --> 00:51.552
Well, he did go to the moon.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.637
And he won't let anyone forget it.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.057
Hey! You're clobbering
my chrysanthemums!

00:59.518 --> 01:02.312
Though I don't recall
that part of the mission.
Though I don't recall
that part of the mission.

01:06.692 --> 01:09.611
It gets better every time you tell it.

01:15.951 --> 01:20.747
This is the perfect addition
to my wall of famous astronauts.

01:25.252 --> 01:29.631
Hey! My geography book!
That's the third time this week.

01:29.715 --> 01:32.634
Snoopy, look what
came in the mail for you. Sally!

01:33.635 --> 01:35.762
Peppermint Patty! Marcie!

01:35.846 --> 01:38.557
Franklin!
Snoopy got a letter from NASA.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.518
Hey. Where's Franklin?

01:42.769 --> 01:44.897
Maybe if I try a new frequency?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.026
Copy that, Charlie Brown.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.529
"Dear Astronaut Snoopy,

01:52.613 --> 01:56.033
In recognition of your work
on the International Space Station,

01:56.116 --> 01:58.994
as well as your achievement
as the first beagle on the moon,

01:59.077 --> 02:01.788
NASA will be dedicating a statue
in your honor."
NASA will be dedicating a statue
in your honor."

02:08.461 --> 02:10.672
- Way to go!
- Nice one, Snoopy.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.382
A statue?

02:12.466 --> 02:15.427
We'll never hear the end of this.

02:15.511 --> 02:16.720
Hey, look!

02:17.679 --> 02:22.142
It also says there's going to be
a special ceremony. We're all invited.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.561
I can't wait to see
what discoveries they've made.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.897
Like all the aliens
they're hiding in the basement?

02:26.980 --> 02:31.193
Lucy, NASA does not keep aliens
in the basement.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.028
You're right. Too obvious.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.072
They're probably in the broom closet.

02:35.155 --> 02:39.535
Well, I can't wait to show NASA the new
long-distance radio I've been working on.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.832
Wait. Nope. That's not it.

02:48.752 --> 02:53.340
So far, I've managed to get a transmission
from the International Space Station.

02:53.423 --> 02:56.927
But now I'm hoping to get something
from even farther in space.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.430
Well, I'm just happy that this trip,
Well, I'm just happy that this trip,

03:00.514 --> 03:04.810
the only thing I'll have to worry about is
getting a front-row seat at the ceremony.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.979
You ought to sit in the back,
Charlie Brown.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.481
That way your head
won't block anyone's view.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.067
Good grief.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.108
Snoopy, I know you had a hard time
deciding what to pack,

03:53.192 --> 03:56.111
but don't you think that's
a little much for one day?

04:12.878 --> 04:15.047
Home sweet home.

04:19.091 --> 04:23.514
Good to see you, old friend.
You haven't changed a bit.

04:58.131 --> 05:02.010
Stop goofing around, Charlie Brown!
You're going to miss the unveiling!
Stop goofing around, Charlie Brown!
You're going to miss the unveiling!

05:02.511 --> 05:03.595
Coming.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.029
<i>Welcome back to--</i>

05:24.366 --> 05:25.617
<i>Thank you, Snoopy.</i>

05:25.701 --> 05:29.288
<i>Welcome back to the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.</i>

05:29.371 --> 05:32.082
<i>The people who brought you
such amazing feats as:</i>

05:32.749 --> 05:34.001
<i>humans on the moon,</i>

05:34.084 --> 05:36.044
<i>the Hubble Space Telescope,</i>

05:36.128 --> 05:37.838
<i>and many more.</i>

05:37.921 --> 05:39.047
Great job!

05:40.299 --> 05:46.138
<i>As you know, I'm NASA's Computerized
Astronaut Recruitment Advisor, CARA.</i>

05:46.221 --> 05:50.142
<i>Training Astronaut Snoopy
was one of the most challenging</i>

05:50.225 --> 05:53.187
<i>but rewarding moments of my career.</i>

05:53.687 --> 05:57.858
<i>Please join me in congratulating
the first beagle on the moon.</i>

05:58.692 --> 05:59.902
Yeah! Yeah!

06:00.402 --> 06:02.946
- That's my boy.
- Great job, Snoopy.

06:06.116 --> 06:11.455
<i>And now, without further ado,
I present Astronaut Snoopy!</i>

06:13.081 --> 06:14.208
Way to go, kid.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.376
Astronaut Snoopy!

06:25.719 --> 06:27.638
<i>No need to be concerned, Snoopy.</i>

06:27.721 --> 06:32.309
<i>All of NASA's statuary is made
to precisely life-sized dimensions.</i>

06:36.355 --> 06:41.485
<i>In recognition of the wonderful support
you all provided to Snoopy's mission,</i>

06:41.568 --> 06:43.654
<i>NASA would like to issue each of you</i>

06:43.737 --> 06:48.158
<i>a complimentary autographed photo
of our guest of honor.</i>

06:50.077 --> 06:51.370
Oh, brother.

06:51.870 --> 06:55.999
<i>Well, great seeing everyone.
Time to get back to work.</i>

06:56.083 --> 06:57.709
<i>Space won't explore itself.</i>

07:05.634 --> 07:06.844
Come on, pal.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.722
Don't tell me you're disappointed
in the size of your statue.

07:12.266 --> 07:16.520
Well, I think it's great.
After all, it's got your smile.

07:21.066 --> 07:25.821
Eureka! Everyone, I got a signal
on my radio. It's coming from--

07:25.904 --> 07:29.741
- Miss Othmar?
- No. I think it's deep space!

07:29.825 --> 07:32.202
- It might even be--
- Alien life!

07:32.286 --> 07:34.371
Actually, yeah.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.415
Wow.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.668
Whatever it is, it's up to us to find out.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.297
Are you sure it's not Miss Othmar?

07:43.380 --> 07:44.548
Yes!
