WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.354
(school bell ringing)

00:22.856 --> 00:24.492
-(phone beeps)
-Hey!

00:24.525 --> 00:26.394
Ah, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's this?

00:26.427 --> 00:28.762
They want to talk to you
about my behavior.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.099
Bye, Miss Crandall.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.734
I'm Mr. Reissman.
I'm the school counselor.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.503
We really wanted
to talk to you...

00:35.536 --> 00:37.338
About Ben's behavior. I know,
the kid just filled me in.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.540
Ben has always been one
of my favorite students.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.041
He's so sweet.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.844
But lately
he's become a bit dark.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.714
He spends most of his recesses
in the classroom,

00:46.747 --> 00:49.850
just sitting there,
staring at me.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.385
Yeah, well,
maybe he values learning

00:51.419 --> 00:52.920
more than eating boogers
on the slide.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.888
He's doing it right now.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.093
So the kid does a little
light peering, so what?

00:59.127 --> 01:00.594
Today, Ben bit me.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.729
Okay, also some light biting.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.397
Wha-Wha-What's the big deal?

01:03.431 --> 01:05.733
Mr. Reissman would like to
recommend to Ben's doctor

01:05.766 --> 01:09.036
that he be placed on 40
milligrams of ADHD medication.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.571
Is that so?

01:10.604 --> 01:13.541
Oh! Okay, no.
No, thank you.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.043
Focusing Ben on his schoolwork
would have a tremendous impact

01:16.076 --> 01:17.245
on his overall demeanor.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.812
Mm-hmm.
And why do your job

01:18.846 --> 01:20.614
when you can have a pill
do it for you-- am I right?

01:20.648 --> 01:21.982
Let me explain something to you.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.784
Ben's mind is as pure
as his heart.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.319
And as long as I am around,

01:25.353 --> 01:27.721
there will not be a drop
of medication in his body.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.590
Ever. End of story.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.325
Ben's already on the medication.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.561
We're just suggesting
he up his dosage.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.797
We'd just hate to see Ben
slip through the cracks.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.467
He hasn't even started his
project for this weekend's

01:39.500 --> 01:41.335
Lockwood Little Inventors Fair.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.003
Other students have been working

01:43.036 --> 01:45.139
on their inventions
for months now.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.907
Well, speaking of slipping
through the cracks,

01:46.940 --> 01:48.509
kind of looks like that shirt
slipped through the cracks

01:48.542 --> 01:50.010
of your laundry basket.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.512
Oh.
(laughs)

01:51.545 --> 01:53.181
Well, I guess years of writing
on white boards

01:53.214 --> 01:54.982
takes its toll on the wardrobe.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.650
(laughs)
Yeah, yeah. Good story.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.118
I'm gonna take care of Ben.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.454
And I'm gonna do it with
some good old-fashioned

02:00.488 --> 02:02.323
hands-on parenting.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.857
Sorry, Big Pharma.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.438
Sorry I'm late.
I thought I was being followed.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.640
Ended up just being a bunch
of hella cute baby birds.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.710
Okay, official Acorn Boys
meeting number 682

02:22.743 --> 02:24.044
coming to order.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.113
Secretary Joshua Feldstein
presiding.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.881
President Chip,
old business, please.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.050
Okay, well, the possum behind
the north wall

02:30.083 --> 02:31.485
is almost completely decomposed.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.887
Our plan to smoke oregano
out of its skull

02:33.921 --> 02:35.289
will commence tomorrow.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.325
On to today's biz.
What we got?

02:43.497 --> 02:46.500
Okay, decent haul.

02:46.534 --> 02:49.069
Not our best, not our worst.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.340
Off the top of my head, we could
soak some tampons in gin

02:52.373 --> 02:53.507
and sit on 'em.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.908
I'm not doing that again.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.744
It's the same exact thing
every weekend.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.313
He's right.
This is kid stuff.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.414
Maybe it's time we put
this whole

03:00.448 --> 03:01.915
Acorn Boys nonsense to bed.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.317
Am I dreaming right now?

03:03.351 --> 03:04.652
Because if I am, wake me up.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.019
This is a freakin' nightmare!

03:06.053 --> 03:07.221
We're Acorn Boys for life.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.389
We took an oath, remember?

03:08.422 --> 03:09.890
We all held hands and-and peed

03:09.923 --> 03:11.191
on that tree stump together.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.227
-We were ten.
-An oath's an oath!

03:13.261 --> 03:16.230
Come on, Chip, you got to admit
it's getting kind of stale.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.565
I mean, you've literally
brought in tampons

03:17.598 --> 03:19.233
five weeks in a row.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.335
These are pads!
They go on it, not in it.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.803
Shows what you know!

03:24.472 --> 03:29.009
I'm sorry.
I apologize.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.878
The pads aren't that different
from tampons.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.447
I can see that now.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.783
Doesn't mean we can't bounce
back from this, right, boys?

03:35.816 --> 03:38.519
-How?
-Well, tomorrow I'll bring in

03:38.552 --> 03:40.120
something so undeniably sick

03:40.153 --> 03:41.955
that you'll be embarrassed
you ever brought up

03:41.989 --> 03:43.724
breaking up the ACBs.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.463
Meeting adjourned.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.064
How could you guys not
tell me about this?

03:51.098 --> 03:53.066
Well, Poodle was a big believer
in popping pills.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.068
I've been giving them to him
since he was four.

03:55.102 --> 03:58.406
Ben has been hopped up on drugs
since he was four years old?!

03:58.439 --> 04:01.141
Relax, it's just medication.
Lots of people take it.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.277
And you should be careful
pulling him off so quickly.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.779
When they took me off lithium,
I went full-on crazy.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.148
I would argue you were on
lithium because you were crazy.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.384
Ben will be fine, all right.
He's young.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.885
His mind's a little spring,
he'll bounce right back.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.421
That's what I'm talking about.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.055
If that kid can handle
what we've been through

04:15.088 --> 04:16.757
-in the last few months,
he can handle anything. -Yeah.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.892
Or maybe those pills are
his last tether to sanity.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.962
-You ever think of that?
-No pill is going to parent Ben.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.497
-That is our job.
-Yeah, that's right.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.798
We are the pills.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.567
Can't wait to see that
old bowl of soup

04:26.600 --> 04:28.969
Crandall's face when he wins
that stupid Inventors Fair,

04:29.002 --> 04:30.270
and he does it drug-free.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.440
Oh, yeah, and then shove
it in her face

04:32.473 --> 04:34.174
-and show her, yeah, yeah...
-Stupid four-eyed nerd.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.609
-She wear glasses?
-She doesn't wear glasses,

04:35.643 --> 04:36.944
but I bet she's got some
in her night table.

04:36.977 --> 04:37.945
Dollars to doughnuts,
sleeps alone.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.347
Ah, stupid night nerd.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.248
Okay. Wow.
Doesn't take much

04:41.281 --> 04:42.850
to get you two on a crusade,
does it?

04:42.883 --> 04:43.884
-Barely anything.
-Almost nothing.

04:47.521 --> 04:51.091
Okay, hands-on parenting,
first attempt, take one.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.961
All right, Benghazi,
hit me with an idea.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.964
A vest. I think Miss Crandall
would really like a vest.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.768
Hmm, well, not that exciting,
but, uh...

05:00.801 --> 05:02.302
how great does it really
need to be?

05:02.336 --> 05:05.005
Uh, Mickey, I just looked up
some past winners.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.274
MICKEY: "Toothbrush with
toothpaste dispenser inside."

05:07.307 --> 05:09.209
"Self-watering plant pot"?

05:09.242 --> 05:11.211
That vest is gonna get smoked.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.547
Yeah, I think we're gonna
have to dig

05:13.581 --> 05:15.215
a little deeper, bud--
what else you got?

05:15.248 --> 05:17.385
Toilet pants!

05:18.486 --> 05:20.621
Toilet pants?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.357
His brain's all jacked up from
quitting those meds cold turkey.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.693
He's used to being
artificially stimulated.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.295
No. He just needs to dust off
the cobwebs a little bit.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.531
Come on, buddy. Come on.
Let's go get your mind right.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.466
I'm warning you,
you're playing with fire.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.868
I'm warning you,
stop warning me about stuff.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.753
Oh, God!

05:52.786 --> 05:54.187
Sniffing my undies, bro?

05:54.221 --> 05:55.756
No, I'm just looking
for something, okay?

05:55.789 --> 05:57.257
Yeah, what kind of something?

05:57.290 --> 06:00.428
Something. I don't know.
Uh, condoms?

06:00.461 --> 06:02.430
Try the Smithsonian.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.033
What are you doing?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.501
Listen, I need something cool

06:07.535 --> 06:09.269
I can bring back
to the Acorn Boys.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.838
Who the hell are the Acorn Boys?

06:10.871 --> 06:13.273
It's my secret group.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.242
If you tell anybody,
I'll beat your ass.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.577
All right, calm down.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.878
Let me guess:

06:17.911 --> 06:19.780
beginning days of the group,

06:19.813 --> 06:21.281
it was a non-stop thrill ride.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.884
And now you're getting
a little bit older,

06:23.917 --> 06:25.118
and the thrill is gone.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.520
So you're looking for something,

06:26.554 --> 06:29.122
anything, just to
put you back on top.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.124
That's exactly right.
How'd you know?

06:31.158 --> 06:33.126
'Cause I had a group of my own
back in the day.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.295
Called ourselves
Boys in the Hole.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.730
Weird. Why?

06:36.764 --> 06:38.932
'Cause we hung out in a hole.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.801
Give me 400 bucks,
I'll fix your problem.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.069
400 bucks?
For what?

06:42.102 --> 06:43.804
It'll be worth it.
Trust me.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.939
You're gonna want to hold
onto these days for dear life,

06:45.973 --> 06:50.110
because once they are over,
it is downhill.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.111
I can see that.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.980
MICKEY:
Go, go, go,

06:53.013 --> 06:56.617
go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

06:56.650 --> 07:00.220
Go! Stop! Okay.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.555
-ALBA: Okay. Salmon time.
-MICKEY: Yep.

07:01.589 --> 07:02.823
Down the hatch.
All of it.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.625
But I don't like
the fishy taste.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.326
Well, do you like the coppery
taste of failure?

07:06.359 --> 07:07.628
'Cause that's all
you're gonna be tasting

07:07.661 --> 07:09.229
unless you eat
that whole plate, okay?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.931
Come on, even the weird gray
part at the bottom.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.500
-And the bones.
-Not the bone...

07:12.533 --> 07:14.668
Why would he eat the bones?
Don't eat the bones.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.137
I don't want to eat any of it.
I'm not hungry.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.772
-Uh...
-It's not about your belly.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.574
-Uh-uh.
-We are feeding your brain.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.943
-There we go, chew it up.
-Good boy. Good boy.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.145
All right! What do you think?
Any ideas?

07:25.178 --> 07:26.146
Toilet pants.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.748
You already said that, guy.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.149
You already said that. Remember?

07:29.182 --> 07:30.183
A hat you can pee in.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.685
Isn't that just a toilet hat?

07:31.719 --> 07:33.487
You got anything
non-toilet-related?

07:33.521 --> 07:35.923
A tree that sings.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.125
A basketball I can dunk.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.160
-ALBA: Mm-hmm.
-Uh, sparkling milk.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.029
Uh, a butt
you don't have to wipe.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.831
Okay. I have a-- you know
what we should do?

07:43.864 --> 07:45.132
We should just...
We should take a break.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.700
Yep.
-Let's take a break.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.035
-Right. -We-We've all
been working so hard.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.102
-Yeah.
-But I still have more ideas.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.504
MICKEY:
You do?

07:50.538 --> 07:52.305
Well, that's great news for me.
Go write 'em down...

07:52.339 --> 07:53.707
-Yeah. -...and I can't wait
to read 'em.

07:53.741 --> 07:54.775
-Okay.
-Okay?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.109
Okay.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.945
-Okay. Uh, new plan.
-Mm.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.213
We're gonna come up
with his idea for him.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.515
Can't get more hands-on
than that.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.383
-Oh, yeah. It's good.
-Let's go.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.156
-All right. I'm leaving.
-Hey.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.691
He'll be here.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.560
I-I don't get who this guy is.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.561
How old is he?

08:13.594 --> 08:15.462
Old. He's banging my aunt.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.130
Trust me, this guy's plugged in.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.666
(knocking on door)

08:18.699 --> 08:21.501
JIMMY:
Gentlemen, brace yourselves.

08:21.535 --> 08:25.338
The future
of the Acorn Boys is now.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.040
(shouting)

08:27.074 --> 08:29.009
-(Jimmy laughs)
-No! -No!

08:30.678 --> 08:32.680
What are you doing?
I gave you $400,

08:32.713 --> 08:34.181
and you get Silly String?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.684
You're right.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.086
What a giant waste of money.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.154
Good thing I brought this!

08:41.188 --> 08:42.189
-Whoa!
-Oh!

08:42.222 --> 08:43.691
-Whoa!
-Chill out!

08:43.724 --> 08:46.660
Right? She's a beaut.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.829
-That's freaking awesome!
-That's awesome!

08:48.862 --> 08:50.397
It is awesome.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.832
But it is not a toy.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.200
This is a serious
tactical weapon

08:53.233 --> 08:54.434
designed specifically

08:54.467 --> 08:56.203
for precision target shooting.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.606
Think you could put two arrows
in there at the same time?

08:58.639 --> 09:01.374
We can sure as hell try.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.043
* Cypress Hill

09:03.076 --> 09:04.544
* Well, I'm an alley cat

09:04.578 --> 09:05.779
-Oh!
-* Some say a dirty rat

09:05.813 --> 09:07.380
* On my side is my gat

09:07.414 --> 09:08.916
* See, I'm all of that,
spittin' out buck shots *

09:08.949 --> 09:10.417
-* Boy, I'm gonna wet'cha
-Oh!

09:10.450 --> 09:11.752
* Run and hide, but I'm still
comin' to get'cha *

09:11.785 --> 09:14.121
* Thinkin' like a peace smoke

09:14.154 --> 09:16.123
* Comin' on a homicide,
you talkin' ish *

09:16.156 --> 09:18.225
* Tryin' to take me for a ride,
I'm not a bad guy *

09:18.258 --> 09:20.594
-* See, I'm the funky feel
-Yeah!

09:20.628 --> 09:22.095
* Finger on the trigger
when my hand's up on the steel *

09:22.129 --> 09:23.196
* Lettin' out a bullet

09:23.230 --> 09:25.132
* This is goin' boo-yah

09:25.165 --> 09:27.701
* You're stuck in my hood,
so what ya gonna do now? *

09:27.735 --> 09:30.237
* Bein' the hunted one
is no fun *

09:30.270 --> 09:32.973
-(boys shouting) -* Sawed-off
shotgun, hand on the pump *

09:33.006 --> 09:34.541
-Yeah! -* Left hand on a 40
-* Puffin' on a blunt...

09:34.574 --> 09:36.576
Ah, thank you, Acorn Boys,

09:36.610 --> 09:38.879
for allowing me to be
part of your sacred group.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.616
Even if it was for just one
destruction-soaked afternoon.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.525
(exhales)

09:54.828 --> 09:57.397
-See you boys in the next life.
-Hey, where you going?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.566
Uh, I paid for that. It's
official Acorn Boys property.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.934
You think I'm gonna leave
a bunch of kids alone

10:00.968 --> 10:02.469
with a crossbow?

10:02.502 --> 10:05.072
What kind of moron
do you think I am?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.840
-(grunts)
-FELDSTEIN: What the hell, Chip?

10:06.874 --> 10:09.176
Now that we've had a crossbow,

10:09.209 --> 10:11.278
we can't just go back
to not having one.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.412
All right, don't worry.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.580
I'll think of something, okay?

10:13.613 --> 10:14.648
MICKEY:
This is insane.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.283
How is a seven-year-old

10:16.316 --> 10:17.951
supposed to come up with
something that no person

10:17.985 --> 10:19.753
-has ever come up with?
-I don't know.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.022
They're all jacked up
on brain pills, that's how.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.991
We can't compete with that.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.592
Yeah, we're like the one
baseball player

10:25.625 --> 10:27.494
not cranked on steroids,
while all the other gorillas

10:27.527 --> 10:28.862
are out there just slamming

10:28.896 --> 10:31.164
-home run after home run.
-Yeah.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.701
You know what I think
we got to do?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.836
-Hmm. -I think we got to level
the playing field.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.805
-What?
-Hear me out. Listen. I know

10:37.838 --> 10:40.808
I was heavily against Ben
polluting his developing mind,

10:40.841 --> 10:43.443
but think about it
this way: our minds?

10:43.476 --> 10:45.612
Already polluted.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.980
That makes sense.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.281
We just need a little nudge,
you know?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.450
So we can give him
a little nudge.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.053
You know what?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.156
I don't see any other way.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.329
Oh, boy. Ah. Not to be
a hypocrite or anything,

11:02.362 --> 11:03.864
but these meds,
they are the real McCoy.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.966
-Right? I am feelin' noice!
-(exclaims)

11:05.999 --> 11:07.567
My brain feels
like the Internet.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.803
Yeah, okay.
So, it's, uh, it's idea time.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.638
-Yeah. -I'm just gonna... I'm
just gonna flow from the dome.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.840
-All right, uh...
-Okay. Spit!

11:12.873 --> 11:13.907
It should be sleek, am I right?

11:13.941 --> 11:16.343
And modern. Biodegradable.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.146
-Yes, but light. But also heavy.
-Oh, oh, oh, I know, I know!

11:19.179 --> 11:21.581
-What? Oh, what? What, what?
-Um, uh, write this down. Um...

11:21.614 --> 11:24.184
-Oh, shoot! I can taste it.
-Oh, what does it taste like?

11:24.217 --> 11:26.754
-Uh, it's just knocking at
the door. -Open it and grab it!

11:27.788 --> 11:30.824
(grunts)
It's gone, lost.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.160
-Aw, damn it. Close. Okay.
-Yeah, I know. Aw, shoot.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.662
All right. (groans)

11:35.695 --> 11:37.865
Well, but here's
the thing, though--

11:37.898 --> 11:40.100
the idea's only, like,
ten percent of the thing.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.935
Oh, yeah, totally.
Yeah, yeah. What do you mean?

11:41.969 --> 11:44.604
Businesses these days-- they're
all about branding, right?

11:44.637 --> 11:47.274
-Okay, um... -Apple. You think
that's just a-a computer?

11:47.307 --> 11:49.910
-Is Nike just a sneaker?
-Uh-huh. Yes.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.779
Well, you're kind of right.
But you're also wrong as hell.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.546
These guys--
they sell a lifestyle.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.015
The idea is interchangeable.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.184
What we have to figure out
is Ben's booth.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.387
-His-his Apple Store,
his Niketown. -Uh-huh, uh-huh.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.355
Once we figure out the booth,
then the invention is just gonna

12:02.389 --> 12:04.091
come to us organically,
and that blue ribbon

12:04.124 --> 12:06.393
-will be mine.
-Or Ben's.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.561
-What, the ribbon? Ben's.
-Yeah.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.197
Yeah, it's Ben's. That's
what I said. What'd I say?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.865
Uh, let me check my notes.
I did not write anything.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.633
-You're not writing?!
-Wha... (stammers)

12:13.666 --> 12:15.402
-Oh, God, I'm gonna rip my hair
out. -Okay, let's go.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.471
Well, why don't you try saying
that to my face, Mom?

12:18.505 --> 12:20.974
What's that?

12:21.008 --> 12:22.575
Uh...

12:22.609 --> 12:24.744
just a majorly deadly weapon.

12:24.778 --> 12:25.779
Can I play with it?

12:25.813 --> 12:27.547
No, you may not.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.050
That's okay.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.619
I should probably get ready
for tomorrow anyway.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.921
What's tomorrow?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.956
You'll see.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.760
MICKEY:
Yes!

12:40.794 --> 12:43.496
-Look at us! This-this booth
is amazing. -Oh.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.732
Uh, all we got to do now
is just slide some invention

12:45.765 --> 12:49.136
into this box, and that
gold medal will be ours.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.904
-Okay, how we doing on time?
-Yeah. Uh...

12:50.938 --> 12:53.340
-fair starts in a couple hours.
-Pill me.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.641
Oh! No más.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.009
-What are you talking about?!
-Wha...

12:56.043 --> 12:58.178
-You ate them?!
-I was hungry.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.447
Alba, we needed those pills

13:00.480 --> 13:02.149
so we could
destroy the competition.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.184
Okay.
We come up with an idea.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.086
No, you ate all of the ideas.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.587
So, yeah, now it's on you.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.122
Go. Yo... That's-that's yours.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.523
-Come on, think, think, think.
-Uh... Okay.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.525
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

13:12.559 --> 13:14.494
Ooh!

13:14.527 --> 13:18.265
Maybe it's not the competition
we destroy. Hear me out.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.868
What if something were to happen
to Benito's project,

13:20.901 --> 13:23.503
like... it got vandalized?

13:23.536 --> 13:27.040
(gasps) That way
he's a victim, not a loser.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.343
I see no flaws with that plan.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.811
-Yeah!
-Let's do it.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.114
(Alba grunting)

13:34.147 --> 13:35.682
*

13:35.715 --> 13:38.251
(Alba yelling)

13:46.860 --> 13:49.462
(yelling)

13:49.496 --> 13:51.731
(both panting)

13:51.764 --> 13:53.233
Okay.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.003
-All right. Okay.
-Yeah. Okay.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.005
-Can I ask you a question?
-Hmm?

13:58.038 --> 14:01.341
Does it look kind of weird that
only Ben's booth was targeted?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.811
Hmm...

14:04.844 --> 14:06.046
We could do a couple more.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.915
-Just to be safe.
-Yeah, okay.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.950
*

14:19.259 --> 14:22.229
-Yes! That is more like it.
-Yeah! Yeah.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.197
All right, now it looks like
somebody came in

14:24.231 --> 14:26.233
-and targeted a specific area.
-Yeah.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.535
-That being said...
-Uh-huh?

14:28.568 --> 14:30.670
-Can I ask you
one other quick question? -What?

14:30.703 --> 14:33.406
Now does it sort of look like
we bashed up these two booths

14:33.440 --> 14:34.908
just to cover up for that one?

14:34.942 --> 14:38.011
Ah, you think a couple more?

14:38.045 --> 14:40.113
-Okay, yeah.
-Yeah, okay.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.292
(Alba shouts)

14:54.094 --> 14:56.129
-Right?
-Uh-huh.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.398
(panting): I think you got it.
I think we got it.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.300
(door opens)

15:02.235 --> 15:03.236
Did you bring it?

15:03.270 --> 15:04.871
No.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.406
All I could find
is more Silly String.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.275
Yo, are you just doing
the same thing Jimmy did?

15:08.308 --> 15:10.210
Yeah, we can see the crossbow
behind your back.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.479
Is it the crossbow

15:12.512 --> 15:15.415
-or is it the crossbow?
-Ow.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.618
(all screaming)

15:21.921 --> 15:23.190
(gags)

15:25.925 --> 15:28.628
Chip.

15:28.661 --> 15:29.963
ANDREW: Oh, my gosh,
oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.398
There's an arrow sticking
out of his chest!

15:31.431 --> 15:33.900
Okay, okay, okay,
everybody just calm down!

15:33.933 --> 15:35.635
Take me, Lord. I'm ready.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.904
You're gonna be fine. Okay?
We can fix this.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.106
I'm so sleepy.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.307
Hey, no. No sleeping. Come on.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.342
Come on, bud.
Please don't die on us.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.146
(grunts)

15:46.179 --> 15:47.947
Stupid Acorn Boys!

15:47.981 --> 15:49.049
Chip!

15:51.184 --> 15:53.586
We got to get that arrow
out of him before Jimmy sees.

15:53.620 --> 15:58.025
Andrew, I'm sorry I said
you look like the tired emoji.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.994
Here. Bite down on this.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.363
Sorry, buddy.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.664
(groans)

16:06.033 --> 16:08.935
(all screaming)

16:08.968 --> 16:10.303
-EDUARDO: Oh, my God!
-CHIP: Put the pad on!

16:10.337 --> 16:11.638
(all shouting)

16:11.671 --> 16:14.207
(knocking at door)

16:17.544 --> 16:20.147
-ANDREW: This will never work.
-EDUARDO: Hurry.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.216
CHIP:
Hey. What's up, man?

16:23.250 --> 16:24.951
Did you, uh, bring the crossbow?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.354
It's funny you should ask.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.623
My crossbow has gone missing.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.360
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

16:33.393 --> 16:34.994
No, that's mad weird.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.502
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.536
Hey, you calling us liars?

16:43.570 --> 16:44.704
Acorn Boys never lie. Got that?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.646
Yeah, I respect that.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.382
Boys in the Hole had
a strict no-lying policy, too.

16:55.415 --> 16:58.218
-Holler if you see it, yeah?
-CHIP: Yeah.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.252
Got it.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.755
(groans)

17:04.524 --> 17:07.094
Okay. Don't panic.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.262
We're gonna handle this
like adults.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.271
(grunting)

17:23.243 --> 17:25.545
Come on, go, go!

17:25.578 --> 17:28.148
Go!

17:36.389 --> 17:38.625
Oh, my God.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.027
What's going on?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.595
Remember when I said
it was a bad idea

17:42.629 --> 17:44.231
to take Ben off his meds?

17:44.264 --> 17:45.432
Look at these.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.766
I told you
this was gonna happen.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.268
His teacher is covered in blood

17:48.301 --> 17:49.536
and filled with arrows.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.438
-Oh, no.
-What?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.440
-My crossbow.
-What crossbow?

17:53.473 --> 17:55.742
The one I got Chip.
Ben must have it.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.179
-Well, where is he?!
-School.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.782
What the hell, Crandall?

18:02.815 --> 18:04.317
Do you have any idea

18:04.351 --> 18:06.453
how hard we...
B-Ben worked on this?

18:06.486 --> 18:09.389
We have been the victims
of a heartless vandalism.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.723
-Oh.
-Oh.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.126
Whoever did this is
a stone-cold psychopath.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.461
I am sick over it.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.230
You know, 'cause Ben,
he invented a cherry of an idea.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.731
You got to ask him.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.533
Well, I would love
to talk to Ben. Where is he?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.338
Oh, now there's
that little bugger.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.511
-Everybody, down!
-Shooter!

18:34.181 --> 18:35.782
He's gonna shoot Crandall
with a crossbow!

18:35.815 --> 18:38.084
(people gasp)

18:38.117 --> 18:40.253
Get off me! No, I'm not.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.655
And I made her a vest.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.325
Uh... oh. Why?

18:45.358 --> 18:46.826
Because I love her.

18:46.859 --> 18:50.129
I invented it so she could stay
organized and clean.

18:50.163 --> 18:53.099
(ragged breathing)

18:53.132 --> 18:54.801
MICKEY:
Oh, um...

18:54.834 --> 18:57.637
-Well... that was it.
-Vest is the answer.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.476
Look, we thought
Ben was gonna kill you.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.612
And instead he was making you
some kind of vest?

19:05.645 --> 19:08.515
Because he loves you?

19:08.548 --> 19:11.117
I call it the Teacher's Pet.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.852
Well, thank you, Ben.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.222
It was very thoughtful
and sweet.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.324
And he did it totally clean,
I might add.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.525
ALBA:
No, and...

19:18.558 --> 19:21.661
we did not take any drugs,
either, FYI.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.130
Well, I admit
this is a side of Ben

19:24.163 --> 19:25.532
that I have not seen before.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.335
He was motivated and focused

19:28.368 --> 19:30.237
and he completed the assignment
all by himself.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.371
I'm impressed.

19:31.404 --> 19:33.873
So, you're saying I was right?

19:33.906 --> 19:35.141
I don't know about that.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.809
But you are saying I won?

19:36.843 --> 19:38.511
Parenting's not a competition.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.812
Ah, says the woman who lost.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.348
-(Alba laughs)
-Come on, big guy.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.882
Let's go take a nap.
We earned it.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.884
Ugh.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.586
Wait a minute.

19:46.619 --> 19:50.590
If Ben's invention was ruined
in the attack,

19:50.623 --> 19:52.859
why did he make this vest?

19:54.794 --> 19:56.396
Okay, so first you're a doctor

19:56.429 --> 19:57.764
and then suddenly
you're a detective?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.832
(laughs)
Tone it down, lady.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.868
Just be a teacher, okay?

20:01.901 --> 20:04.371
CHIP:
Okay, old business.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.573
Yesterday was completely insane.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.741
I can't believe
my parents bought

20:08.775 --> 20:10.743
that I skated
into a tree branch.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.280
Sit down!

20:16.449 --> 20:18.618
Acorn Boys betrayed me?

20:18.651 --> 20:20.753
And don't tell me Feldstein
skated into a tree

20:20.787 --> 20:22.689
because I've been outside
listening for a while.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.557
-We can explain.
-Don't bother.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.429
You stole my crossbow,
shot Feldstein,

20:29.462 --> 20:30.930
and lied to my face.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.668
The Acorn Boys are finished.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.276
'Cause you Acorn Men now.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.511
(can opening)

20:52.485 --> 20:55.788
And I am so damn proud
of you guys!

20:55.822 --> 20:57.424
-Hell, yeah.
-(whoops)

20:57.457 --> 20:59.592
-ACM for life.
-Thanks, Jimmy.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.594
-No.
-What?

21:01.628 --> 21:04.764
I said no.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.600
W-We've seen too much.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.671
It's time to move on.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.845
I officially declare this
the 684th

21:18.878 --> 21:21.481
and final meeting
of the Acorn Boys.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.683
President Chip, signing off.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.840
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:47.874 --> 21:49.409
BEN:
Toilet pants.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.682
Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
with The Mick.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.984
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.323
* Hey-ay-ay *

22:04.357 --> 22:07.193
* Hey-ay-ay *

22:07.226 --> 22:09.228
WOMAN:
This is our story.

22:09.261 --> 22:11.531
* Can't stop me now *

22:11.564 --> 22:13.633
* Can't stop me now *

22:13.666 --> 22:15.668

22:15.702 --> 22:17.169
* Won't stop doing what I do *

22:17.203 --> 22:18.705
* Can't stop me now *

22:18.738 --> 22:21.708
-* Can't stop me now *
-* Can't stop me now *

22:21.741 --> 22:24.010
-* Cannot beat me *
-* Can't stop me now *

22:24.043 --> 22:25.645
* I'm just doin' what I do *

22:25.678 --> 22:27.914
* Won't stop doin' what I do *
