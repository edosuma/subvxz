WEBVTT

00:24.080 --> 00:26.200
-Strawberry flavored.
-I love berries.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.840
Can I put it in without a condom?

00:55.920 --> 00:58.040
-Hmm?
-You know it feels so much better.

00:58.120 --> 00:58.960
Please?

00:59.040 --> 01:03.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Just remember to pull out before you come.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.960
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm. Okay?

01:13.200 --> 01:14.520
-Babe?
-Yeah?

01:15.800 --> 01:18.600
-Why do you look like Rocky Balboa?
-What do you mean?

01:22.520 --> 01:23.920
-I'm gonna come!

01:24.000 --> 01:25.240
Pull out! Pull out!

01:25.320 --> 01:27.600
Into the tissues.
Not on the sheets, Malek!

01:32.160 --> 01:33.560
What the fuck?

01:35.360 --> 01:36.720
-Okay.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.640
What are you looking at?

01:56.920 --> 01:58.640
Your eyebrows look bad today.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.960
Mm, do you want to

02:04.480 --> 02:05.680
smooth 'em out for me?

02:05.760 --> 02:07.320
Not particularly, no.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.360
Well, I was thinking
maybe you could stay over tonight.

02:15.880 --> 02:16.920
Watch a movie.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.800
Maybe, uh… …you know?

02:21.280 --> 02:23.880
-No, thanks.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.600
-I've gotta go home.
-Oh.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.720
Ruby, are you sure everything's all right?

02:30.920 --> 02:32.200
Why do you keep asking me that?

02:32.280 --> 02:34.920
Well, I have noticed you're being

02:36.000 --> 02:37.840
meaner to me than usual.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.280
-Like you're annoyed with me.
-What would I be annoyed about?

02:43.160 --> 02:47.320
I can't give you a lift tomorrow,
so I'll just see you at school.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.640
-Okay?
-Okay.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.200
That's really good. Is mine good?

03:07.280 --> 03:09.280
Yeah, yours is really good.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.480
Maeve, would you like to stay for dinner?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.280
No, thanks.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.200
-I've gotta get up early tomorrow.
-How come?

03:18.280 --> 03:21.760
I have to finish this application
for an overseas study thing,

03:21.840 --> 03:23.520
and I need to use a school computer, so…

03:24.360 --> 03:26.040
Well, why don't you use mine?

03:26.640 --> 03:27.680
No, it's okay.

03:27.760 --> 03:31.080
Honestly, it's fine.
Then you can stay for dinner too.

03:35.920 --> 03:36.800
Okay.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.680
Thanks, Anna.
I'll see you and Elsie on Saturday.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.520
Weren't you going on a school trip?

04:01.560 --> 04:04.200
-Do you need help paying for it?
-No, thanks. I don't need charity.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.040
Mum?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.040
Mum, I can see you.
What are you doing here?

04:14.120 --> 04:16.400
So, what, you're besties
with her now, are you?

04:16.480 --> 04:19.400
No, I'm not besties with her.
I'm just visiting Elsie.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.520
-What are you doing here?
-Just going for a quick evening run.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.040
It's not illegal, is it?

04:26.840 --> 04:29.000
You only wear hats
when you're doing something dodgy.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.000
Fine.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.160
I walk past the house sometimes
to know she's safe.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.280
Elsie's safe here.
You don't need to worry about that.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.920
That woman's got
a "dance like nobody's watching" poster.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.640
She's clearly a sociopath.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.560
Do you think Elsie misses me?

04:50.480 --> 04:51.440
Course she does.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.280
You're her mum.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.120
She just wants you to get better
so you can be together all the time.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.640
Come on.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.800
So what's happening with this Isaac?
I like him.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.640
It's none of your business.
Stop being so nosy.

05:08.520 --> 05:09.920
Pardonnez-moi!

05:11.640 --> 05:15.440
So, how has it been living together again?

05:18.960 --> 05:19.920
It's been good.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.800
No problems.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.560
Yes, it's been good.

05:23.640 --> 05:29.080
We've been, uh,
settling into the new family situation.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.760
I think it's a big adjustment
for our kids.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.000
How… how are they feeling about things?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.240
Well, Otis,
who's my son, has a girlfriend,

05:38.320 --> 05:42.680
and so he's very much been asserting
his independence from me,

05:42.760 --> 05:45.680
and I don't see him very much anymore,

05:45.760 --> 05:47.400
which is a little painful,

05:47.480 --> 05:50.080
but I'm trying to respect his boundaries.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.160
-And…

05:53.880 --> 05:55.200
And Ola,

05:55.760 --> 05:57.320
who's Jakob's daughter,

05:57.400 --> 06:00.720
I think she might be feeling uneasy
around me and

06:01.640 --> 06:02.840
the new family setup.

06:03.520 --> 06:07.320
What is the situation
with Ola's own mother?

06:07.920 --> 06:08.840
Oh, she's dead.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.040
She… she passed away
a few years ago from cancer.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.360
And is this loss something you can both

06:23.000 --> 06:24.600
talk about openly?

06:24.680 --> 06:25.520
Yes.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.120
I think we've talked about it, haven't we?

06:30.200 --> 06:34.080
Yeah, well, I… I don't like
to dwell on the past too much, but yeah.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.360
Well, that went well?

06:42.040 --> 06:45.400
Uh, yeah. Well,
then we don't have to do it again, or…

06:47.960 --> 06:51.200
You do know that therapy isn't
a one-session process, right?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.240
-That some people go for years.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.720
Yeah, I'm sure Dr. Cutton would love
to have our money for years.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.360
-Wait. What are you saying?

06:59.080 --> 07:02.880
Are you saying that therapy's just
a cynical money-making practice?

07:02.960 --> 07:05.480
I'm not sure I believe in it.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.000
You don't believe in therapy?

07:10.080 --> 07:11.160
Come on.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.320
I'm not saying
you're not very good at your job,

07:15.400 --> 07:18.800
but I'm not sure
that talking can fix everyone.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.920
What? Did I make you upset?

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
You are entitled to your opinion.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.800
Oh. Thank you.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.120
My God.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.720
Shit!

08:13.480 --> 08:15.280
Oh, uh, what's your favorite food?

08:15.800 --> 08:17.600
Food. Uh, lasagna?

08:17.680 --> 08:19.720
No, pizza. And fish and chips.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.560
I like peanut butter on toast,
but not too toasted and without crusts.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.880
That's incredibly unhelpful.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.520
Let's just get takeaway, then.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.440
Got much planned
for today, compadre?

08:38.280 --> 08:39.680
Um…

08:39.760 --> 08:40.720
No. Not really.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.360
What about you?

08:45.240 --> 08:48.760
Oh, I'll be spending the day
pretending I like teaching.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.080
It's good to be busy.

08:53.680 --> 08:57.080
Oh, is that the time?
I better skiddle-skaddle-doo.

08:57.640 --> 09:01.200
Hey, listen. Why don't you,
me, and Emily have dinner tonight?

09:01.280 --> 09:04.360
You can pick up the ingredients today.
How do you feel about Mexican?

09:04.440 --> 09:05.480
I don't cook.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.560
It comes in a packet, dude.
We'll cook it. You just gotta eat it.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.280
Okay? We're on.

09:10.920 --> 09:13.640
We're on like Donkey Kong.

09:15.160 --> 09:16.040
Cool.

09:16.120 --> 09:16.960
Cheers!

09:30.880 --> 09:32.880
How come Ruby didn't drive you in today?

09:33.440 --> 09:35.480
I wanted to ride in with my best friend.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.520
Hmm? You've had a fight, haven't you?

09:38.600 --> 09:42.120
No. No, not had a fight exactly.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.240
What did you do?

09:45.120 --> 09:46.640
Okay. Um, all right.

09:46.720 --> 09:51.760
So a few days ago, Ruby said,
"I love you," and I didn't say it back.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.520
Oh my God!

09:55.200 --> 09:56.360
Well, what did you say?

09:57.320 --> 09:58.320
I said,

09:59.040 --> 10:00.080
"That's nice."

10:01.120 --> 10:05.120
-Hey! Hey, hey!
-Is that bad?

10:05.200 --> 10:06.200
Very bad.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.960
Very, very bad.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.040
-You said, "That's nice"?
-Yeah.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.720
Yeah. Well, I couldn't lie, Eric.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.720
And it's not like I don't really like her.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.560
I do, but love is a big word,

10:17.640 --> 10:20.160
and I don't think
I've felt that way about anyone.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.240
Except Maeve.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.520
Yes, but that is over.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.960
I… I don't even know if I believe in love.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.200
It's all just…
it's all just a chemical reaction.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.520
Otis,
you're the most romantic person I know.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.760
Maybe you just don't feel that way
about Ruby yet, which is fine,

10:35.280 --> 10:37.680
but you have to tell her the what?

10:39.440 --> 10:41.120
-The truth.
-The truth.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.480
Because the longer you leave it,
the more hurt she'll be. Yeah?

10:45.360 --> 10:46.520
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.720
-Yeah.
-Come on!

10:59.960 --> 11:03.280
I… I was thinking that maybe if I got a B

11:03.360 --> 11:05.160
on the test this afternoon,

11:05.240 --> 11:08.080
that I might be able to move up a set.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.720
Fingers crossed, Adam.

11:12.560 --> 11:15.280
Okay. Um, all right. Come over.

11:15.360 --> 11:19.400
Uh, remember what I said
about how sentences need full stops?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.040
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.800
Show me here where they would go.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.120
-What's happened to your face?
-What's happened to your face?

11:32.640 --> 11:35.400
-Nothing.
-Nothing's happened to my face either.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.760
Something's happened to your face, mate.

11:41.600 --> 11:45.840
-Anwar, your face is hideous.
-I know. I look like a crazy fucking mofo.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.360
-Well, should you go to hospital?
-No, I think it's just stress hives.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.160
-What are you stressed about?
-It's hard being me. Okay?

11:53.240 --> 11:54.320
-Ruby!

11:54.840 --> 11:58.480
Want me to carry your bag to SRE for you?
Maybe we can have a little chat.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.280
-You back in the game?
-Mm-hmm.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.240
Ooh la la. Ooh la la. Ooh la la.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.760
Are you sure that she said she loves you?

12:15.760 --> 12:17.800
'Cause it seems more like she hates you.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.480
Attention, everyone.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.120
I'm sure you've read today's news article
with Dr. Jean Milburn.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.240
"After spending a length of time
on the Moordale campus,

12:27.320 --> 12:29.120
I realized there is a battle happening

12:29.200 --> 12:32.520
for the emotional
and sexual health of our teenagers."

12:32.600 --> 12:33.720
I don't know about you,

12:33.800 --> 12:37.560
but I am sick of hearing our school's name
being dragged through the mud,

12:37.640 --> 12:40.760
which is why I'm implementing a plan
to put a stop to that.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.160
It starts with a new syllabus for SRE,

12:43.240 --> 12:45.760
which will now be called
Growth and Development.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.320
And to put our parents'
and investors' minds at ease,

12:49.400 --> 12:52.280
I want you all to follow
these new guidelines precisely.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.760
That means no one will diverge
from the set topics,

12:55.840 --> 12:58.920
and no one will talk to students
about their private lives.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.880
The students usually have
quite a lot of personal questions.

13:02.960 --> 13:06.560
School is not a place
for personal questions.

13:07.240 --> 13:11.320
Jobs were lost over inappropriate events
that happened on this campus,

13:11.400 --> 13:14.160
and I want you all to be protected
from that happening again.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.200
Understand?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.360
I'm off to pregnancy yoga.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.760
What are you doing?

13:26.840 --> 13:29.360
I'm building a tree house.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.520
Okay. Why?

13:33.120 --> 13:34.800
It will be fun for our baby to play in.

13:34.880 --> 13:39.400
I made one for my daughters
when they were kids, and they loved it.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.400
It's okay?

13:42.240 --> 13:43.120
Sure.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.560
Viv, wait up!

14:02.120 --> 14:05.280
-So you're talking to me again?
-I was never not talking to you.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.880
I was wondering
whether we could talk to Hope

14:07.960 --> 14:11.560
about setting up something where people
could talk about what they need on campus.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.640
-What kind of thing?
-A forum or something.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.000
People could talk about
mental health or gender identity.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.040
This is how far you'll go to get a girl.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.360
-What?
-Person.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.760
Do you even care about this,
or are you trying to get into Cal's pants?

14:23.840 --> 14:24.680
Uh, okay.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.200
Look, you were right.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.840
I didn't take head boy seriously, okay?
I didn't care.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.840
But I wanna be better.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.760
Okay, um, I'll think about it.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.040
All right.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.440
I just read your story.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.680
It's amazing.

14:47.760 --> 14:52.360
I can't believe Glenoxi had sex
with Starlanza after she ate her mother.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.040
She's very complicated.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.400
Do you think I've got a chance at winning?

14:56.480 --> 14:58.960
Do you think The Moordale Gazette's
the right place for it?

14:59.480 --> 15:00.560
I already applied.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.920
Oh. Okay.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.640
It might not be
to everyone's taste, you know?

15:07.600 --> 15:09.440
I think I've got a pretty good shot.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.880
I told you, you have to have
the perfect timing of the mushroom.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.680
-How are you getting the perfect timing?
-When you see the blue shell…

15:17.200 --> 15:18.880
Wow, Lily,

15:18.960 --> 15:20.720
you look normal.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.360
Your hair looks nice, Lily.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.280
Yeah, you're almost pretty.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.600
What happened to your face?

15:32.200 --> 15:34.400
I was giving you a compliment.
Doesn't mean we're friends.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.960
Did my hair really look that weird before?

15:38.040 --> 15:38.880
No.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.040
I thought it looked really cute.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.280
Listen up, everyone.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.320
If you haven't paid for the school trip,
please see Hope today.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.560
Mmm.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.760
I cannot wait to eat baguettes with you!

15:51.840 --> 15:53.960
-What?
-I'm being French.

15:54.040 --> 15:54.920
Oh, okay.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.440
Um, yeah, I'm not gonna go
on the school trip.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.240
-Why?
-'Cause it's too expensive.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.640
It's not that much, is it?

16:00.720 --> 16:03.880
It is expensive. My mum freaked out
when she saw how much it was.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.720
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.880
For today's SRE class,

16:09.960 --> 16:12.840
boys will be in this classroom
and girls in this one.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.760
Can we please form
two orderly lines, please?

16:15.840 --> 16:17.200
Uh, where do I go?

16:19.680 --> 16:20.960
Yeah, I don't know.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.360
So Cal wants to know
what line they should join.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.840
Boys in this classroom
and girls in this one.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.320
But I'm non-binary.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.120
-I… I don't know which line either.
-Um, wait here. I will ask for you.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.880
What seems to be the problem?
Other than your uniform again.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.160
We don't fit into the description
of boy or girl,

16:42.240 --> 16:43.680
so where are we supposed to go?

16:45.080 --> 16:46.680
You can both go in the girls' line.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.400
But I'm not a girl.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.600
They'll be discussing female anatomy,
which I'm sure will be helpful for you.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.880
So we go to the vagina or penis line.
Is that what you're saying?

16:55.960 --> 16:59.480
It's okay. I… I don't wanna cause trouble.
I'll go with the girls.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.600
Thank you. That's very helpful.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.520
Is there anything else, Cal?

17:03.600 --> 17:05.920
Mm-hmm. This is complete bullshit.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.200
Be careful, Jackson.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.800
Wouldn't want
to see you going down the wrong path.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.600
-Okay, guys.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.520
No questions, okay? No questions.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.720
You again! No!

17:29.800 --> 17:31.720
Oh, hello there.

17:32.280 --> 17:36.720
We all know what it's like to get
unwanted and unnecessary erections,

17:36.800 --> 17:38.360
whether it's during your sleep,

17:38.440 --> 17:42.640
at a disco, or kissing the girl
you've got a crush on for the first time.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.040
Sleep for me.

17:44.120 --> 17:46.160
How do you deal with the danger

17:46.240 --> 17:48.560
of unexpected emissions

17:48.640 --> 17:51.560
until you're ready
for procreating with your wife?

17:51.640 --> 17:55.200
I'm here to tell you
about how a night of sex ruined my life.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.760
Did me and my boyfriend use a condom?

17:58.280 --> 17:59.200
Yes.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.600
Did it split?

18:01.400 --> 18:02.240
Yes.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.640
Did my boyfriend tell me?

18:05.280 --> 18:06.120
No.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.240
Homosexual activities have
a much higher rate

18:09.320 --> 18:11.920
of leading
to sexually transmitted diseases

18:12.000 --> 18:13.720
such as herpes,

18:13.800 --> 18:14.760
syphilis,

18:14.840 --> 18:16.200
HIV,

18:17.640 --> 18:18.880
and AIDS.

18:18.960 --> 18:22.800
Um, sir, this video is not talking
about safe sex at all.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.240
It's just shaming gay people.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.520
What do flying penises
have to do with STIs?

18:26.600 --> 18:30.800
Remember, we're not asking questions.
We're just watching the video, so--

18:30.880 --> 18:33.080
-Why can't we ask questions?
-That's another question.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.640
They're making valid points
about this video, which isn't informative.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.040
It's just preaching abstinence
and homophobia,

18:39.120 --> 18:41.920
which is dangerous,
and we're a bit old for flying penises.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.400
-Stop saying "penis" to me.
-You can't put this on and expect us--

18:45.480 --> 18:47.760
Please, you're disrupting the class.
Get out.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.280
-Seriously?
-Yes, seriously. Go.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.480
He can't say "penis" in sex ed, sir?

18:52.560 --> 18:53.840
I'm sorry, okay?

18:53.920 --> 18:58.080
But I could lose my job
if I let you all ask me questions.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.000
Just watch it, please.

19:00.520 --> 19:05.760
I believe teenagers shouldn't have sex
because sex will ruin your life.

19:05.840 --> 19:06.920
Forever.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.360
I went from having dreams
to having a six-month-old baby

19:10.440 --> 19:13.800
that left me with a leaky bladder
and a baggy vagina.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.680
Sorry, is the boys' class being taught
about pregnancy as well,

19:16.760 --> 19:17.960
or is it just us girls?

19:19.360 --> 19:20.480
It's just us, is it?

19:21.080 --> 19:23.000
-Very progressive.
-Quiet, Maeve.

19:23.520 --> 19:27.120
After getting pregnant,
I had no choice but to leave school.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.360
There are always choices.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.600
-Women do not have to have children.
-Enough!

19:30.680 --> 19:32.640
We shouldn't be shamed
for having sexual desires.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.960
You make sex sound terrifying,
but it doesn't have to be.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.920
It can be fun and

19:37.800 --> 19:41.200
beautiful and teach you things
about yourself and your body.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.040
You should be telling us
how to do that safely.

19:44.120 --> 19:47.360
Not telling us to refrain
because it doesn't fucking work.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.200
Okay. Out, now.

19:50.680 --> 19:51.600
Happily.

19:58.520 --> 19:59.960
-Right.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.720
Now we're going to watch
a video of me giving birth,

20:02.800 --> 20:06.080
where you'll see that I tore
from my vagina to my arsehole.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.400
Oh, your poor vagina!

20:15.440 --> 20:17.080
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

20:17.600 --> 20:22.080
Yeah, but my opinions on abstinence
weren't appreciated, so I got kicked out.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.880
Yeah, me too.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.160
We need to tell Hope she can't be
teaching this stuff. It's backwards.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.760
-She's not gonna listen.
-We need to do something.

20:31.840 --> 20:32.880
Like what?

20:33.400 --> 20:37.040
I dunno.
Maybe we could help people like before.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.520
You mean take their money?

20:40.200 --> 20:42.200
That wasn't the only thing
the clinic was about.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.760
What else was it about?

20:48.440 --> 20:50.880
Anyway, I'm not getting involved anymore.

20:51.480 --> 20:52.720
It's not my problem.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.080
It's not your problem?

20:54.800 --> 20:57.640
Why? Because you're too cool?
You don't need to care anymore?

20:57.720 --> 20:59.720
You didn't wanna do the clinic either.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.680
Yeah, you're right.
And now I remember why.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.160
I'm going to the library.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.600
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.960
-Hey!
-Hey.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.360
-I've been looking all over for you.
-Huh?

21:19.160 --> 21:21.120
Uh, do you wanna talk about it?

21:22.440 --> 21:24.120
-Nope.

21:25.840 --> 21:26.680
Let's get baked.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.000
Okay.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.600
Sometimes me and Malek
don't use a condom. He pulls out.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.960
I thought that if something went wrong,
I would just get the morning-after pill.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.720
-That's okay, right? Yeah, that's okay.
-No, that's not okay!

21:40.800 --> 21:43.760
We've just watched a woman push
something the size of a watermelon

21:43.840 --> 21:44.840
out of her vagina.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.120
Nothing's okay.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.440
My rash could be syphilis, herpes, or HIV.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.840
-I think I'm gonna die.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.240
Anwar!

21:52.880 --> 21:55.560
Okay, we must never have sex again.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.920
-Agreed.
-Understood.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.360
Um, I could get in trouble for this,
but realistically, you'll have sex again.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.280
What I just witnessed
would make Helen Brook roll in her grave.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.120
So, for the love of God,

22:10.200 --> 22:13.240
please talk about contraception
to a sexual health professional.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.600
There's a sexual health clinic
on Mayfield Road. Mayfield Road.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.240
Oh. Yeah, thanks. Bye.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.720
-Where the fuck is Mayfield Road?
-Who the fuck is Helen Brook?

22:22.240 --> 22:24.840
I think she was an advocate
for reproductive rights.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.400
Ruby, please can we talk?

22:26.480 --> 22:28.200
Not now, Otis!

22:28.280 --> 22:31.200
I've got to go
and protect myself from your penis!

22:31.280 --> 22:33.280
-There's a time and a place.
-Yeah.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.360
Okay, ladies.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.680
Let's move onto our sides,

22:48.760 --> 22:52.360
using a bolster to support
your beautiful, blooming bellies.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.200
Let's breathe in…

22:58.360 --> 22:59.520
and out.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.200
Taking a moment

23:06.680 --> 23:08.280
for ourselves.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.280
Breathe in

23:16.200 --> 23:17.240
and out.

23:20.560 --> 23:21.880
Oh.

23:30.960 --> 23:31.960
You okay?

23:32.720 --> 23:34.840
Jakob is building a tree house.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.440
Pardon?

23:36.520 --> 23:37.600
Oh.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.240
He's building a tree house for the baby,

23:40.760 --> 23:42.680
which is really lovely, right?

23:43.480 --> 23:44.760
Yeah, that's lovely.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.040
Then why
am I feeling like I can't breathe?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.440
You're just feeling panicky.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.800
It's okay. It's normal.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.440
I thought this was the right thing to do…

23:56.240 --> 23:58.720
…for me, for the baby.

23:59.280 --> 24:03.040
I didn't want to raise
another child alone,

24:03.680 --> 24:06.240
and now
I'm feeling like I'm losing control.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.280
And…

24:08.920 --> 24:11.160
…I think I've made a really bad decision.

24:11.240 --> 24:12.960
What makes you think that?

24:13.040 --> 24:15.720
Well, we have nothing in common, Maureen.

24:15.800 --> 24:16.680
Nothing.

24:16.760 --> 24:17.600
I mean,

24:18.120 --> 24:20.960
I feel like
I'm having a baby with a stranger.

24:22.640 --> 24:26.560
You know, Michael and I used to have
a lot in common.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.720
Wanted the same things in life.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.880
Nice house, babies, a dog.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.680
But in the end, we had all those things…

24:38.920 --> 24:41.200
but no connection.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.280
-Jakob adores you.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.040
I know these changes are scary,

24:52.000 --> 24:53.800
but I think that counts for a lot.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.520
Thank you.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.080
I needed that.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.040
Shall we go back inside?

25:08.120 --> 25:09.040
Do we have to?

25:09.120 --> 25:11.440
-Stinks of farts in there.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.360
At least they're not my farts.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.520
Sentences need full stops.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.880
Sentences need full stops.

26:01.960 --> 26:02.800
Oi!

26:04.560 --> 26:05.480
Shut up!

26:06.120 --> 26:07.440
I'm trying to concentrate.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.680
Here are your books, Rahim.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.560
And the, um…

26:24.080 --> 26:25.680
and the poems you wrote me.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.080
Why did you keep them?

26:28.240 --> 26:30.000
I don't know.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.120
Just… No one's
ever written me poetry before.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.160
I wanted to remember it.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.440
-Adam doesn't write you poetry?
-Sorry?

26:41.800 --> 26:43.600
Sorry. No, it's just, um…

26:44.320 --> 26:46.880
No, Adam does not write me poetry.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.080
Well, that's sad.

26:48.160 --> 26:49.280
Poetry is magic.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.360
Abracadabra.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.080
Heard you were talking about magic.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.840
No, we were talking about poetry.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.000
-Yeah.
-Right.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.360
Eric doesn't like poetry. That's why
he's giving you your books back.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.880
I never said I didn't like poetry.

27:09.800 --> 27:13.360
The poet Ariana Brown said
about our various selves

27:13.440 --> 27:16.200
that they are
"all names you wear in harmony."

27:17.440 --> 27:18.520
"Until you can't."

27:24.720 --> 27:26.000
Was he taking the piss?

27:26.600 --> 27:28.280
I don't know.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.960
Why did you say I didn't like poetry?

27:31.560 --> 27:34.000
Well, I didn't think that you did.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.720
-Why do you care what he thinks?
-I don't.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.320
-Why are you getting upset about it?
-I-- We're arguing again!

27:46.240 --> 27:50.160
I think it will be good for us
to get some space when I'm in Nigeria.

27:50.760 --> 27:54.120
-You wanna get away from me?
-Adam, you are so defensive!

27:54.200 --> 27:56.640
No, no, no. You just said
that you wanna get away from me.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.200
How am I supposed to feel?

27:59.520 --> 28:02.120
-I don't have the energy to fight.
-Fine. Don't, then.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.280
-Hello, Hope.
-Hi.

28:15.600 --> 28:19.160
I wanted to talk about what happened
with the girls' and boys' lines.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.320
Okay.

28:20.400 --> 28:23.080
I think it made
some students feel really uncomfortable.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.320
Well, I'm not sure
school is supposed to be comfortable.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.280
I think it's supposed to be hard.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.960
And challenging.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.200
I agree 100%.

28:33.280 --> 28:36.440
But I wonder if students
might have space to be challenged

28:36.520 --> 28:38.840
if they felt we were listening
to their concerns.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.360
Okay. What do you suggest?

28:40.440 --> 28:43.680
I was thinking of setting up
a student forum to hear direct feedback

28:43.760 --> 28:46.120
from students about what they wanna see
implemented on campus.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.360
This shows great initiative, Vivienne.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.480
I'll be interested
to see what you discover.

28:51.560 --> 28:52.960
In the meantime,

28:53.040 --> 28:56.080
I'd like you to keep an eye
on your peers during the trip.

28:56.840 --> 29:00.640
-So can I have your number, please?
-Yeah.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.120
I'll text you.

29:04.960 --> 29:05.800
Okay.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.760
Great.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.760
Okay.

29:15.360 --> 29:17.160
Ah, Maeve.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.760
Have you calmed down

29:20.840 --> 29:23.680
since your little outburst
in Growth and Development?

29:23.760 --> 29:25.960
Well, what was being taught is bollocks.

29:27.560 --> 29:31.840
That spirited energy would be
better channeled into your education,

29:31.920 --> 29:35.160
especially if we're going
to find the funding for the GTIP.

29:37.680 --> 29:38.880
Sorry for saying bollocks.

29:40.280 --> 29:43.120
You wanted to see me
about the trip? I can't go.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.480
Your fees have been paid.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.400
By who?

29:48.040 --> 29:49.320
It was an anonymous payment.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.080
Okay.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.600
I'm serious about the hair.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.280
Change it immediately.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.080
Oh, Michael.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.720
How are you?

30:18.800 --> 30:21.640
-I didn't think you liked Mexican food.
-I don't.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.200
Not that I've tried it.

30:25.280 --> 30:28.040
I'm just shopping for dinner.
My friend is cooking…

30:30.040 --> 30:31.800
"fa-jee-tas."

30:33.840 --> 30:34.800
Um…

30:35.400 --> 30:37.920
It's pronounced "fajitas."

30:38.000 --> 30:39.080
Oh.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.520
I think you might like them.

30:43.280 --> 30:46.240
How are you coping with everything?

30:46.840 --> 30:47.680
Good.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.080
I'm very, very

30:51.120 --> 30:52.160
excellent.

30:56.920 --> 30:57.960
How's Adam?

30:59.600 --> 31:01.480
Why don't you ask him yourself?

31:02.840 --> 31:04.200
I haven't heard from him, so…

31:04.280 --> 31:06.640
I think he'd appreciate it
if you reached out to him.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.000
You're his father.

31:11.400 --> 31:13.080
It's not too late to fix things, you know?

31:24.280 --> 31:27.440
The pull-out method can lead
to unwanted pregnancy

31:27.520 --> 31:31.040
if your partner doesn't pull out in time
or sperm gets into your vagina.

31:31.680 --> 31:36.160
It also puts you at greater risk
of getting or transmitting an STI.

31:38.200 --> 31:41.040
Is your boyfriend putting pressure on you
not use a condom?

31:41.560 --> 31:43.680
He says it makes it feel better for him.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.280
How does it feel for you?

31:46.280 --> 31:50.200
Like I can't enjoy the sex
'cause I'm scared of getting pregnant.

31:50.280 --> 31:52.600
Well, that's no good for anyone, is it?

31:53.400 --> 31:55.080
-Now, tell me.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.560
Do you engage in unprotected sex?

31:57.640 --> 32:00.560
Every film I've seen with a gay person
ends with them having sex

32:00.640 --> 32:02.360
and dying of AIDS.

32:02.880 --> 32:06.160
I don't wanna die.
So, yeah, I always use a condom.

32:06.240 --> 32:11.000
So long as you and your partner,
or partners, are practicing safer sex,

32:11.080 --> 32:14.760
getting tested regularly,
you're very unlikely to contract HIV.

32:15.360 --> 32:19.600
There's a medication now called PrEP
that protects people from contracting HIV

32:19.680 --> 32:22.320
if they are engaging
in frequent casual sex

32:22.400 --> 32:24.800
in situations
that might be putting them at high risk.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.720
And for those that do contract the virus,
there's medicines now

32:27.800 --> 32:29.960
that enable them to live
a long and healthy life,

32:30.040 --> 32:32.480
even get to the stage
where the virus is undetectable,

32:32.560 --> 32:35.240
which means
it can't be passed on to somebody else.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.800
So, I don't think
you're gonna be dying for a while yet.

32:39.600 --> 32:44.640
Now have you changed your diet recently
or used any new detergents?

32:44.720 --> 32:45.560
No.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.480
What about new condoms or lube?

32:55.400 --> 32:58.240
Well, apparently, I'm allergic
to strawberry-flavored condoms.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.720
Mm-hmm. And my boyfriend's a dickhead.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.320
You gonna dump him?

33:03.400 --> 33:05.600
No. I still love him, annoyingly.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.320
Um, does he love you?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.960
Yeah. Of course he does.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.200
Ruby Matthews. You can come in now.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.720
Otis doesn't love me.

33:19.800 --> 33:20.920
What do you mean?

33:22.600 --> 33:25.800
I told him that I loved him,
and he didn't say it back.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.480
What did he say?

33:29.520 --> 33:31.960
He said, "That's nice."

33:32.040 --> 33:34.160
-What a dickhead.
-Everyone loves you.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.320
I know. That's why I'm so confused.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.920
I think I'm in the wrong place.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.320
I couldn't decide
which of your favorite meals to make,

33:54.400 --> 33:57.640
so I made them all.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.640
Well, Joe did, but, um…

34:01.600 --> 34:02.680
I'm really trying here.

34:03.440 --> 34:04.480
I can see that.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.720
These chips are cold.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.960
Well, you were late.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.800
Yeah, well, I was cutting my hair.
New school rules.

34:24.880 --> 34:26.600
-Looks nice.
-Thanks.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.520
I think Anna paid for my France trip
without telling me.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.440
-So you're going?
-I don't need charity from anyone.

34:35.320 --> 34:38.520
Maeve, don't be proud.
Just go on the trip.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.440
Don't tell me what to do.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.680
So you're still angry at me, then?

34:45.080 --> 34:46.200
That would be a lot easier…

34:47.640 --> 34:48.560
Than liking me?

34:51.480 --> 34:52.680
Yeah, than liking you.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.520
But you also fucked up.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.680
Why did you do it?

35:05.280 --> 35:06.360
I was threatened.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.200
You just get me.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.520
Like, we've both been through
so much of the same shit.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.480
You understand me like nobody else does.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.120
I didn't wanna give that up.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.280
Well, I feel the same.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.640
I'm truly, truly sorry.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.640
Can…

35:58.760 --> 35:59.640
Nothing.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.920
You wanna know what I can feel?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.080
Yeah.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.760
Well, I can't feel anything

36:11.640 --> 36:13.240
below my level of injury.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.800
Um…

36:19.960 --> 36:22.120
If you put your hand on my chest,
I'll show you.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.800
-Okay.
-I'll tell you when.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.040
There you are.

36:49.920 --> 36:51.120
I can get hard.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.040
I just need a little help.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.880
Not that we're gonna do that yet.

36:56.400 --> 36:57.240
So…

36:59.920 --> 37:01.640
would you be able to come or…

37:01.720 --> 37:02.760
Yeah.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.600
Sort of, um…

37:08.360 --> 37:11.120
When I get touched
in the places that I can feel…

37:13.760 --> 37:15.240
it can get a little intense.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.320
So…

37:22.840 --> 37:23.840
Here?

37:27.480 --> 37:28.480
Yeah.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.800
Please may I take your T-shirt off?

37:56.120 --> 37:58.360
There you go. Just like magic.

37:59.440 --> 38:01.920
-Well, I feel somewhat exposed.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.160
Now we're equal.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.800
Well, where do you like to be touched?

38:13.240 --> 38:14.600
Above the waist.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.600
I'm quite into my ears being touched.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.960
-Please may I touch your ears?

38:23.760 --> 38:24.760
Yeah.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.040
That would be the other lasagna.

38:50.600 --> 38:51.600
Um…

38:52.400 --> 38:54.400
Thanks for inviting me over.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.680
I've been wanting to talk

38:56.760 --> 38:58.400
because I know

38:59.200 --> 39:00.800
why you're angry with me.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.480
And I wanted to say
I've been having an amazing time with you,

39:05.200 --> 39:06.880
and I do really like you.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.640
Mm, you like me?

39:10.160 --> 39:11.000
Yeah.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.440
I like you a lot.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.760
But you don't love me.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.640
I just have to say that in my own time.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.560
And I don't feel that way right now.

39:27.640 --> 39:29.200
That's not to say I won't.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.480
I just don't at the moment.

39:33.320 --> 39:35.240
I've never said that to anyone.

39:36.520 --> 39:37.400
I'm sorry.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.720
We haven't been dating for that long,

39:44.400 --> 39:47.320
and I don't know
if you actually love me love me.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.160
I introduced you to my dad.

39:49.240 --> 39:52.240
I've never introduced anyone
to him before.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.520
Well, we could still keep hanging out
like we are.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.520
You need to go.

40:04.600 --> 40:07.400
Do you mean go just now or go for good?

40:10.240 --> 40:11.440
For good.

40:31.840 --> 40:32.880
One sec.

40:36.760 --> 40:40.080
-Can't I just pull out?
-Do you wanna have a baby with me?

40:41.600 --> 40:42.720
No.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.960
I mean, not until I've gone to uni
and I've got a job.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.560
Mm, yeah. Well, put a condom on, then.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.520
Uh, I gotta go. I gotta go.

41:12.440 --> 41:13.800
Mm-mmm.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.400
Oh! This is incredible!

41:18.480 --> 41:21.360
Mm. The balance of flavors
and the hint of fire.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.920
It's so different!

41:24.520 --> 41:26.920
-How was your day, Michael?
-Bumped into Maureen.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.240
Mm.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.560
And she asked me how I was,
and we spoke about Adam briefly.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.840
Mm. And then, just as she was leaving,

41:33.920 --> 41:37.480
she said something about
it never being too late to fix things,

41:37.560 --> 41:39.080
and then she touched my arm.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.000
That's major! She wants you back!

41:41.080 --> 41:43.000
Colin, that's not our business.

41:44.280 --> 41:47.000
Unless that's something you want?

41:47.720 --> 41:48.560
Mm.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.200
Well, you have to let her know
before it's too late.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.960
Make a gesture.
Oh, send her a fruit basket.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.560
-She's not in hospital, Colin.
-Helium balloon.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.920
-Or five years old.
-Hot air balloon.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.080
Way too much.

41:59.160 --> 42:02.960
I think
she would appreciate something personal.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.320
Something meaningful to your relationship.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.520
Women like to feel like
they've been heard.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Mm.

42:14.040 --> 42:15.480
Ah, bleh, bleh.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.400
Hello, darling.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.080
-Hey.
-Nice day?

42:21.960 --> 42:23.240
It was okay.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.560
They're teaching us abstinence
in school now.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.920
-What?

42:30.000 --> 42:32.800
-What's Jakob doing?
-Building a tree house.

42:48.280 --> 42:49.720
It's looking good, Jakob.

42:50.600 --> 42:51.600
Yeah.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.200
Do you need some help?

42:55.280 --> 42:56.320
Yeah, come here.

42:57.040 --> 43:00.440
If you hold this one like that.

43:00.520 --> 43:01.680
You take this one.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.520
-Okay.
-And I hold here.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.080
-You okay?
-Yeah.

43:08.760 --> 43:09.800
Yeah?

43:11.360 --> 43:15.520
I just hurt someone really badly,
and I kinda feel like shit.

43:17.960 --> 43:19.240
Did you do it on purpose?

43:19.960 --> 43:20.920
No.

43:24.040 --> 43:25.880
Ruby wanted me to say I loved her.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.200
But I didn't feel the same.

43:31.080 --> 43:32.600
You did the right thing.

43:33.440 --> 43:34.520
I don't know.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.120
She was really upset.

43:37.680 --> 43:38.520
Well,

43:39.040 --> 43:41.680
people deserve your whole heart, Otis.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.800
If you can't give them that,

43:44.440 --> 43:45.960
it's better they know.

43:46.600 --> 43:48.280
It's the kinder thing to do.

44:07.480 --> 44:08.560
Come on.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.400
These are for you.

44:29.480 --> 44:30.600
Oh.

44:31.440 --> 44:34.200
Thank you. Why?

44:35.120 --> 44:38.040
Well, you said
it's not too late to fix things,

44:38.640 --> 44:41.160
and I know we broke up
because I didn't want mangoes--

44:41.240 --> 44:44.040
I meant fix things between you and Adam.

44:46.200 --> 44:49.480
But, Michael, we didn't break up
because you didn't want mangoes.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.240
Then why did we?

44:53.960 --> 44:56.080
-Maureen! Everything okay?
-Um…

44:58.160 --> 44:59.000
Who's that?

44:59.760 --> 45:00.800
It's, uh…

45:01.480 --> 45:02.480
Um…

45:03.640 --> 45:06.200
I'm seeing someone new.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.080
Right. Good.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.400
-Sorry. Uh…

45:14.000 --> 45:15.120
Well, congratulations.

45:16.800 --> 45:17.840
Thank you.

45:18.440 --> 45:19.480
Yeah.

47:07.840 --> 47:11.080
Adam! You know
you can ring the doorbell now. We go out!

47:11.160 --> 47:13.800
Yeah, but I can't stay, I can't stay,
so can you come down?

47:14.400 --> 47:15.800
Okay. Come to the front door.

47:26.920 --> 47:29.720
Hey. I… I'm sorry I lost my temper. I…

47:35.040 --> 47:36.120
I know.

47:36.840 --> 47:38.360
I know. It's just, I…

47:40.400 --> 47:42.280
I just wish you wouldn't get jealous.

47:44.280 --> 47:45.280
I chose you.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.040
I, uh…

47:52.760 --> 47:56.000
I don't want us to have space…

47:58.200 --> 47:59.400
'cause I love you.

48:07.040 --> 48:07.880
I love you too.

48:28.560 --> 48:30.320
Hi there. What's-- Ooh.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.040
Okay.

48:35.760 --> 48:38.120
Glad to see
you took my advice seriously, Maeve.

48:40.080 --> 48:43.760
Something tells me
you don't take advice from anyone, Cal.

48:43.840 --> 48:46.800
-Your uniform's still shabby.
-I don't understand why it's a problem.

48:48.880 --> 48:51.600
Perhaps you can attend
Vivienne's student forum next week

48:51.680 --> 48:53.280
and raise your concerns there.

48:54.880 --> 48:56.880
Do keep me updated on the trip, please.

48:57.920 --> 48:59.200
Vivienne's forum?

49:00.440 --> 49:03.320
-You didn't tell her it was my idea?
-Didn't come up.

49:10.800 --> 49:13.280
Miss, how… how did I do on the test?

49:14.920 --> 49:16.800
You got a D.

49:18.800 --> 49:22.720
You'll have to stay in the same set.
Please don't be disheartened. Keep trying.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.440
What's the point?
I'm not good at anything.

49:24.520 --> 49:26.280
Everyone's good at something, Adam.

49:26.920 --> 49:30.720
Maybe start by thinking about
the things you like doing.

49:31.440 --> 49:35.280
I'm… I'm quite good at pretending
I'm Gandalf in Lord of the Rings.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.280
But that's a start.

49:43.440 --> 49:44.640
Excuse me, sir.

49:44.720 --> 49:45.560
Hi.

49:45.640 --> 49:46.960
-Hey.
-All right.

49:47.040 --> 49:48.160
Over to you two, then.

49:48.240 --> 49:51.880
I'm trusting you
to maintain some discipline.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.160
-Okay?
-Okay.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.320
-Okay.
-You betcha.

50:27.480 --> 50:30.240
Okay! Let's go to France, motherfuckers!

50:30.320 --> 50:31.440
Sorry, sorry.

50:36.320 --> 50:37.680
France!

50:37.760 --> 50:40.880
Yo!
