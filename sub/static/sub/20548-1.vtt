(audience clapping)

00:48.792 --> 00:51.000
(audience cheering)

01:02.208 --> 01:06.708
- Hello, I'm Steve Byrne.
This is my wife, Ok Cha.

01:06.708 --> 01:08.667
This is our other son,
Will.

01:08.667 --> 01:11.375
(cheering)

01:11.375 --> 01:14.500
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.041
I'm going to introduce

01:16.041 --> 01:18.917
the funniest man
in the whole world.

01:18.917 --> 01:21.875
Here, this is Steve Byrne!

01:21.875 --> 01:24.875
(cheers and applause)

01:36.583 --> 01:38.750
- How are ya?

01:38.750 --> 01:39.625
Good.

01:39.625 --> 01:40.750
Thank you.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.917
Thank you!

01:42.917 --> 01:46.375
How are ya?
Good to see ya.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.458
Thank you, thank you.

01:48.458 --> 01:50.250
We're good, thank you.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.917
Thank you guys so much,
appreciate it.

01:52.917 --> 01:54.708
Thank you.

01:54.708 --> 01:57.333
Thank you so much.

01:57.333 --> 01:59.250
Thank you all for making time.
I appreciate it.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.792
It's good to be back here
in Chicago.

02:00.792 --> 02:02.250
How 'bout it for Jamiah,
everybody?

02:04.417 --> 02:05.875
Awesome.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.458
My brother, my parents.
How 'bout it for my mom?

02:10.333 --> 02:13.291
Who addressed you all like
a Korean dictator.

02:16.417 --> 02:18.500
So, let's get into this.
I recently turned 40.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.417
Let me tell you something
about turning 40.

02:20.417 --> 02:23.291
When you turn 40,
you will hear this in your life,

02:23.291 --> 02:25.667
and hopefully you will hear it
the rest of your life.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.291
"You look good for 40."

02:27.291 --> 02:32.208
"You look good for 52."
"You look great for 63."

02:32.208 --> 02:33.458
You never hear that
when you're young.

02:33.458 --> 02:37.291
You never hear,
"You look good for 19."

02:37.291 --> 02:40.041
If you hear "You look good
for 19," guess what?

02:40.041 --> 02:43.792
You look like shit for 19.

02:43.792 --> 02:46.125
You should never
hear that.

02:46.125 --> 02:47.667
I gotta say, I, uh...

02:47.667 --> 02:52.041
I embrace that I'm in my 40s.
I'm not gonna run away from it.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.375
I know this: it's over.
Over.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.667
No more medium t-shirts
for this asshole.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.875
Naw.

02:58.875 --> 03:00.291
Those days are long gone.

03:00.291 --> 03:01.959
Saturday rolls around,
a friend calls you up,

03:01.959 --> 03:05.166
"Hey, we get fucked up tonight?"
"No, we're not."

03:06.166 --> 03:07.625
"What are you gonna do?"

03:07.625 --> 03:11.208
"There's a two-hour 'Dateline',
is what I'm gonna do."

03:11.208 --> 03:13.959
I gotta solve a murder
with Lester Holt this evening.

03:16.667 --> 03:18.417
I don't want to sound grim,
I don't want to sound negative,

03:18.417 --> 03:22.500
but once I turned 40,
I accept death a little more.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.625
Like, I don't want to die.
I want to live a long life,

03:24.625 --> 03:27.333
I want to see all those
"Star Wars" movies too, okay?

03:27.333 --> 03:30.208
But... but if death happened
to me tomorrow,

03:30.208 --> 03:33.542
it's like,
fuck it, I'm tired.

03:33.542 --> 03:36.375
I'm exhausted right now
and I just got to work.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.375
People are like,
"You look tired."

03:39.375 --> 03:41.875
"I am. 40 years
of this bullshit. I'm beat."

03:43.542 --> 03:44.542
This is what I mean

03:44.542 --> 03:47.875
about losing
the will to live, okay?

03:47.875 --> 03:49.375
If I have a large
cardboard box,

03:49.375 --> 03:50.375
I gotta take it out
to the recycling garbage cans.

03:50.375 --> 03:53.000
This box won't fit
in the garbage cans.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.542
I gotta go back in,
I gotta get scissors,

03:54.542 --> 03:56.000
I gotta come back out,
I gotta break it--

03:56.000 --> 03:56.834
You know what?
I'd rather die

03:56.834 --> 03:59.000
than break down this box,
honestly.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.375
Fuck the Earth.
Sorry, Earth, not this week.

04:03.875 --> 04:06.291
If I go to a gas station,
I swipe my card at the pump,

04:06.291 --> 04:08.875
it says, "Please come inside,
see attendant."

04:08.875 --> 04:11.041
I'd rather die than
go inside

04:11.041 --> 04:14.041
and see that attendant.
I'd literally rather

04:14.041 --> 04:15.041
get in my car
and drive three miles

04:15.041 --> 04:18.916
to another gas station

04:18.916 --> 04:21.041
than walk ten feet...

04:25.625 --> 04:27.083
I'd literally rather drive
three miles

04:27.083 --> 04:28.375
than walk ten feet

04:28.375 --> 04:30.458
into your piece-of-shit
place of business

04:30.458 --> 04:32.750
'cause you don't have
your shit together.

04:32.750 --> 04:33.959
Fuck you, come see me.

04:33.959 --> 04:34.750
You know where the money is,
asshole.

04:34.750 --> 04:38.458
(cheering)

04:43.458 --> 04:45.083
You guys getting excited
to vote for a new president?

04:45.083 --> 04:47.875
(cheering)
- (man) Bernie!

04:47.875 --> 04:49.000
- Tell you what...

04:49.000 --> 04:51.917
I'd rather die than vote for
any of these fuckers.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.000
All of them.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.417
The worst.

04:56.417 --> 04:59.708
This is what I truly love
about every election cycle.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.166
Every election cycle,
there's a member of the press

05:01.166 --> 05:02.500
that will ask a candidate,

05:02.500 --> 05:04.500
especially a male candidate,
this question.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.458
Now, the purpose of
that question is to see

05:07.458 --> 05:09.250
if the candidate is in touch
with the common folk.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.708
This is that question.

05:10.708 --> 05:11.959
"Sir, do you know the price
of a gallon of milk?"

05:11.959 --> 05:14.458
They never know.

05:14.458 --> 05:15.917
And I'll tell you why
they don't know in a second,

05:15.917 --> 05:17.291
but first off, to any man

05:17.291 --> 05:18.792
that's gonna run
for elected office, know this.

05:18.792 --> 05:20.959
They're gonna ask you that
question, be prepared.

05:20.959 --> 05:22.458
Here's how you hit them back.

05:22.458 --> 05:23.500
"Sir, do you know the price
of a gallon of milk?"

05:23.500 --> 05:26.583
"Absolutely not, no.
I'm lactose-intolerant.

05:29.875 --> 05:32.083
"I can't enjoy ice cream
or cereal

05:32.083 --> 05:34.083
"because I have a fear
I'll shit my pants.

05:34.083 --> 05:34.625
Anything else?
Moving on."

05:37.125 --> 05:38.166
Now, here's why a man

05:38.166 --> 05:39.333
does not know the price
of a gallon of milk.

05:39.333 --> 05:42.041
He's married.
He has a family.

05:42.041 --> 05:45.500
And that wife won't let him
go grocery shopping, okay?

05:45.500 --> 05:48.166
My wife will not
let me be responsible

05:48.166 --> 05:49.333
for feeding our family
for a week

05:49.333 --> 05:51.333
'cause if I go
grocery shopping,

05:51.333 --> 05:53.000
we're eating Steak-Umms
and DiGiornos

05:53.000 --> 05:55.125
every day for seven days.

05:56.792 --> 05:59.750
"Candidate Byrne, do you know
the price of a gallon of milk?"

05:59.750 --> 06:03.625
"I know a meatball DiGiornos
is $7.99, I do know that."

06:03.625 --> 06:05.500
"Right, the question
is a gallon of milk."

06:05.500 --> 06:08.834
"I know a 12-pack of Sunkist
is $2.99, I do know that.

06:08.834 --> 06:11.625
"I'm 40 years old
and I eat like an eighth-grader.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.041
Next question."

06:16.834 --> 06:19.250
Now, when it comes to politics,
I think some people are--

06:19.250 --> 06:20.583
They just know
out of the gates

06:20.583 --> 06:22.375
when they're born
their affiliation.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.458
Some people, it just takes time,
where you grew up,

06:24.458 --> 06:26.208
your influenced
by friends and family.

06:26.208 --> 06:28.208
For me, I always liked a little
on this side,

06:28.208 --> 06:29.208
I always liked
a little on this side.

06:29.208 --> 06:30.208
Now I definitely know my stance
these days.

06:30.208 --> 06:31.583
So, if someone's like,

06:31.583 --> 06:34.041
"Hey, what's your take
on the death penalty?

06:34.041 --> 06:35.375
"How do you feel about our
presence in the Middle East?

06:35.375 --> 06:38.333
What's your stance
on abortion rights?"

06:38.333 --> 06:40.708
Here's my take on all those
and more.

06:40.708 --> 06:43.959
I don't give a shit.

06:43.959 --> 06:45.750
I could give a flying fuck.

06:45.750 --> 06:50.041
None of that shit applies
to my daily life, okay?

06:50.041 --> 06:51.542
I don't hang with murderers.

06:51.542 --> 06:52.875
I don't know anybody
on death row, so I don't care.

06:52.875 --> 06:55.417
The Middle East, they've been
fighting for thousands of years,

06:55.417 --> 06:56.875
we're not gonna change that,

06:56.875 --> 06:59.667
and thank God my daughter
is not old enough to fuck.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.708
I don't give a shit.
Okay?

07:03.542 --> 07:06.708
Here are the pressing issues
in my life, okay?

07:06.708 --> 07:09.208
I'm ten years away
from Centrum Silver.

07:11.417 --> 07:12.250
My back sucks,
my vision's gone,

07:12.250 --> 07:13.792
my right knee's a little
wonky,

07:13.792 --> 07:17.208
my wife doesn't think
I give her enough back massages.

07:17.208 --> 07:18.792
I have been putting off
an oil change

07:18.792 --> 07:19.959
for 2-1/2 months.

07:19.959 --> 07:20.834
Is my engine gonna blow
today?

07:20.834 --> 07:23.417
I don't know.
Let's roll the dice.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.542
These are the issues.

07:37.834 --> 07:40.834
I think when you turn 40,
you look back on the goals

07:40.834 --> 07:42.750
you made for yourself
in your 20s and 30s

07:42.750 --> 07:44.917
and think, did I hit
those benchmarks?

07:44.917 --> 07:46.458
Have I accomplished my goals?

07:46.458 --> 07:47.792
I think I've done some damage,

07:47.792 --> 07:49.458
but I haven't hit
my ultimate goal.

07:49.458 --> 07:50.333
This is what I truly want
in life.

07:50.333 --> 07:54.291
I want "fuck you" money.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.792
I want money
that's undeniable,

07:55.792 --> 07:58.333
you can just splash somebody
in the face with it.

08:00.458 --> 08:01.750
I want money that's powerful,
you just sit down,

08:01.750 --> 08:02.792
"Hey, you can't sit there."
"What?"

08:02.792 --> 08:05.792
"You can't sit there."
"Oh, I can't sit here?

08:05.792 --> 08:07.000
"Come here.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.625
Fuck you!"

08:16.875 --> 08:17.750
"Now pick that up."

08:20.875 --> 08:22.333
We...

08:22.333 --> 08:23.667
We've all been outside
of a bar, right?

08:23.667 --> 08:25.375
Your bouncer won't let you
or your friends in.

08:25.375 --> 08:26.375
One of your friends
is so tanked, he's like,

08:26.375 --> 08:27.542
"You're not gonna let us in?

08:27.542 --> 08:29.750
You know what,
you piece of shit?

08:29.750 --> 08:33.958
I could buy this-- No!
I could buy this place."

08:33.958 --> 08:36.875
I always want to say that.

08:36.875 --> 08:37.625
But I can't.

08:37.625 --> 08:38.958
I mean, technically,
I could.

08:38.958 --> 08:41.542
It's like, "You're not gonna
let me in? Are you serious?

08:41.542 --> 08:45.417
"Just so you know,
I could buy this place, okay?

08:45.417 --> 08:47.792
"With a second mortgage
out on my house, a...

08:47.792 --> 08:49.041
"government-assisted loan,
definite loan from my parents.

08:49.041 --> 08:51.917
"I probably would not turn
a profit for seven, eight years

08:51.917 --> 08:53.917
"'cause I have no experience
in the nightlife industry.

08:53.917 --> 08:55.792
"I'd probably keep you on,
you're competent at your job,

08:55.792 --> 08:59.250
but technically, so you know,
I could buy this place."

09:06.792 --> 09:10.708
At my age, I will admit certain
things to you all right now

09:10.708 --> 09:13.125
that I would never tell you
in my 20s.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.625
30s, I might, but I'd err
on the side of caution.

09:15.625 --> 09:16.708
40, I don't give a shit
anymore.

09:16.708 --> 09:21.708
I'll tell you, as a man,
I have had a cat boner.

09:22.875 --> 09:26.333
It's always women.
Women always say, "What?"

09:27.208 --> 09:28.291
But most guys are like,

09:28.291 --> 09:30.542
"Yeah, I think I know
what he's talking about."

09:30.542 --> 09:33.625
You guys know
what I am talking about.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.333
You go visit your girl
or you're with your girl,

09:35.333 --> 09:36.708
she got a cat,
cat jumps on your lap,

09:36.708 --> 09:38.250
you start petting it.
"Oh, that's a good girl.

09:38.250 --> 09:39.583
"Oh, you're frisky, okay.

09:39.583 --> 09:42.250
You like-- Oh, that's the spot.
I gotcha, okay, that's the..."

09:42.250 --> 09:44.250
Cat's getting into it,
it's like...

09:53.417 --> 09:55.667
"Yeah, oh, o--
Oh, shit.

09:55.667 --> 09:58.583
"Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

09:58.583 --> 09:59.917
"Gotta get you-- the claw!

09:59.917 --> 10:01.834
Get the fuck out of here,
all right."

10:02.750 --> 10:05.083
That's why I see these men
in their 50s

10:05.083 --> 10:08.041
going to the pharmacy,
going to these boner pills.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.875
Fuck that.
Go to a shelter.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.291
Adopt.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.667
Don't make that sick,
honey.

10:20.667 --> 10:21.792
It's a girl cat.
It was a fucking girl cat.

10:21.792 --> 10:25.542
It's not a dude cat.
I'm not disgusting.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.125
"So gross.
Oh, let's go to

10:31.125 --> 10:33.208
the comedy show
and take the jokes seriously."

10:33.208 --> 10:35.959
Jesus.

10:35.959 --> 10:38.291
We got 40 minutes left.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.583
It's gross.

10:40.583 --> 10:41.625
At my age,
I believe in social justice.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.667
By social justice,
I mean this.

10:43.667 --> 10:46.625
If you cut in front of me
at a bank,

10:46.625 --> 10:48.708
at an airport,
in any line,

10:48.708 --> 10:51.500
I will say something to you now
at my age.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.667
When I was younger,
I wouldn't say anything,

10:52.667 --> 10:54.583
but 40 years on this planet
it's like,

10:54.583 --> 10:55.625
I'm gonna say something.

10:55.625 --> 10:58.625
So if you cut in front of me
at a bank,

10:58.625 --> 11:00.125
this is what comes out,
okay?

11:00.125 --> 11:03.000
It sounds polite,
it's kind of passive-aggressive,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.917
but this ultimately
is what happens, okay?

11:04.917 --> 11:05.834
So, if you cut in front of me,
this is what comes out.

11:05.834 --> 11:08.041
"Excuse me, pardon me,
there's a line.

11:08.041 --> 11:11.625
Excuse me, there's a line."
That's what comes out.

11:11.625 --> 11:13.125
What's in here is,
"Hey, fuck face!

11:13.125 --> 11:16.583
"Get the fuck back there,
you piece of shit!

11:16.583 --> 11:18.750
You better than everybody?!"

11:21.000 --> 11:24.417
"Enjoy the walk, your majesty.
Get the fuck-- go.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.208
"Get out of my face.

11:26.208 --> 11:28.041
Walk."

11:28.041 --> 11:32.542
And all that comes out as,
"Excuse me, there's a line."

11:34.417 --> 11:35.333
Now, if you're gonna
be a man

11:35.333 --> 11:37.500
and parade around town
wearing a badge

11:37.500 --> 11:39.166
and become a social sheriff,
know this.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.667
There will come times
where you question yourself.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.834
Was it worth it?
Should I have opened my mouth?

11:43.834 --> 11:46.166
I had an incident recently
where I questioned myself.

11:46.166 --> 11:49.792
I was... I was with my family
at Disneyland, okay?

11:49.792 --> 11:51.750
So, you wait for hours
to go on all these rides.

11:51.750 --> 11:52.875
Finally, we go to eat lunch.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.917
I waited in line
33 minutes

11:54.917 --> 11:56.542
to spend $28
on chicken fingers,

11:56.542 --> 11:59.750
which is reasonable,
right?

11:59.750 --> 12:01.875
Wait in line,
wait in line, wait--

12:01.875 --> 12:03.542
Finally, at the front
of the line

12:03.542 --> 12:04.708
ready to place my order,
a guy walks

12:04.708 --> 12:06.375
on the other side
of the register,

12:06.375 --> 12:08.542
she takes the order. I go,
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, excuse me.

12:08.542 --> 12:09.542
Can we just create
our own line here?"

12:09.542 --> 12:11.708
He goes, "Actually,
I'm a season pass holder.

12:11.708 --> 12:13.166
There's always two lines.
You just didn't--"

12:13.166 --> 12:14.375
I go, "I'm not talking to you.

12:14.375 --> 12:15.500
"I'm definitely
not talking to you.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.875
Excuse me, can we just
create our own line here?"

12:16.875 --> 12:19.083
She goes, "Is there a problem,
sir?"

12:19.083 --> 12:19.917
I go, "There is now, yeah.

12:19.917 --> 12:21.208
I'd like to see
your manager."

12:21.208 --> 12:22.458
She says, "Excuse me?"

12:22.458 --> 12:23.500
I go, "I want to see
your manager."

12:23.500 --> 12:24.792
She says this to me:

12:24.792 --> 12:27.375
"But... this is the happiest
place on Earth."

12:29.667 --> 12:30.875
"Not today it's not, bitch.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.750
Get that goddamned manager now.
Now!"

12:33.750 --> 12:35.291
Now, that's what I said
in my head.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.500
I didn't say that out loud.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.250
What came out loud was,
"Okay."

12:38.250 --> 12:40.458
So I pay...

12:40.458 --> 12:42.583
aggressively.

12:42.583 --> 12:43.792
Now I'm in the ball pen

12:43.792 --> 12:45.583
with all the other parents,
right?

12:45.583 --> 12:46.917
The manager comes over,

12:46.917 --> 12:48.875
I reiterate my story
out of principle.

12:48.875 --> 12:49.875
As I do, the guy is right there,
he pipes up again, he goes,

12:49.875 --> 12:52.959
"I wasn't cutting.
I'm a season pass holder.

12:52.959 --> 12:54.583
There's always two--"
I go,

12:54.583 --> 12:56.375
"Dude, you're cheap.
Shut up, shut up."

12:56.375 --> 12:58.708
As I say "shut up,"
I realize this.

12:58.708 --> 13:02.583
Everybody in front of me
and behind me is uncomfortable.

13:02.583 --> 13:03.750
My wife is pissed off.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.041
I can feel her body heat
and it is August

13:06.041 --> 13:08.083
in Southern California.
That is heat.

13:08.083 --> 13:11.500
My daughter's crying.
This man wants to fight me.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.750
And as I say "shut up,"

13:12.750 --> 13:14.458
behind him walks
his eight-year-old son

13:14.458 --> 13:17.041
and I just dressed down his hero
in front of his very eyes.

13:17.041 --> 13:20.000
All these variables
hit me in a second

13:20.000 --> 13:21.083
and then the manager
says this to me:

13:21.083 --> 13:23.792
"Sir, I am so sorry,
so here's what I can do.

13:23.792 --> 13:26.083
I can offer you
a free cupcake."

13:36.708 --> 13:37.875
"Well, then I'll take that
cupcake, please sir,

13:37.875 --> 13:39.458
"Yeah, I'll take it.
Yeah, okay.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.208
"Sprinkles? Chocolate, yeah.
I earned it. Give it.

13:41.208 --> 13:45.458
Give me the goddamned--
Give me the cupcake now."

13:45.458 --> 13:46.417
She hands me the cupcake,

13:46.417 --> 13:48.125
I hold the cupcake
in front of my wife,

13:48.125 --> 13:49.750
I'm like, "Got a cupcake
out of it, right, kinda cool?"

13:49.750 --> 13:53.125
It is not cool.
It is not cool.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.542
The guilt drives me down
to the ground

13:55.542 --> 13:56.166
and I kneel down in front
of that

13:56.166 --> 13:57.041
little eight-year-old boy

13:57.041 --> 14:00.000
and I hold out that cupcake.
Yeah.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.792
And I take a big-ass bite
of that cupcake.

14:11.834 --> 14:13.834
Now, my wife didn't talk to me
for an hour,

14:13.834 --> 14:16.083
but I didn't give a shit.
I kept a sprinkle

14:16.083 --> 14:18.041
in the corner of my mouth
like a single teardrop tattoo.

14:20.166 --> 14:21.834
Letting her know,
that's a man you married, bitch.

14:21.834 --> 14:25.834
That is a man you married,
bitch.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.667
And here's the lesson
in this story.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.000
The lesson is this.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.166
I am now a very proud
season pass holder

14:32.166 --> 14:34.750
at Disneyland, so...
thank you.

14:40.041 --> 14:43.041
Now, I've been married
for 4-1/2 years,

14:43.041 --> 14:44.667
we've been together for eight.

14:44.667 --> 14:45.834
I'm glad I met my wife
when I did.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.208
I met her before a lot
of dating apps, social media.

14:47.208 --> 14:50.750
Everything so accessible
right there on your cell phone.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.875
Look, I got great guy friends,
best friends.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.500
I see the representation

14:54.500 --> 14:56.625
of my friends
in profile pictures,

14:56.625 --> 14:59.041
I don't know who that guy is.

14:59.041 --> 15:01.875
This is my point, I'm talking
to every fella in this room.

15:01.875 --> 15:04.417
Pay attention, gentlemen,
know this.

15:04.417 --> 15:07.208
You're not sexy.
Okay?

15:07.208 --> 15:09.083
Visually, you're not,
so please no more selfies

15:09.083 --> 15:11.875
in front of a gym mirror
doing bicep curls

15:11.875 --> 15:14.166
and duck lips.
It's got to stop.

15:14.166 --> 15:16.875
Nobody wants to go online
and see who's shirtless

15:16.875 --> 15:19.083
in front of a Toyota Corolla

15:19.083 --> 15:23.208
doing Taekwondo with a boner.
Please!

15:23.208 --> 15:24.250
Uncool.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.125
You want to take a picture
of something sexy,

15:27.125 --> 15:29.750
you take a picture
of a balanced checkbook

15:29.750 --> 15:30.959
with a lot of zeroes
in it.

15:30.959 --> 15:34.166
That apparently is very sexy.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.250
And fuck you whores.
You just fell for my trap.

15:38.250 --> 15:41.083
I smoked you out.
I know who you gold diggers are.

15:44.375 --> 15:45.750
You single ladies know this.

15:45.750 --> 15:46.917
I don't shed a tear
for single ladies.

15:46.917 --> 15:48.375
I'm so tired of girls.

15:48.375 --> 15:49.708
"It's hard out there.

15:49.708 --> 15:50.959
"You know, it's really difficult
to meet a guy.

15:50.959 --> 15:52.583
It's tough to meet a man."

15:52.583 --> 15:53.750
Is it?
Go outside.

15:53.750 --> 15:57.166
They're fucking everywhere.

15:57.166 --> 16:02.000
Honestly, pick up a rock,
throw it, you'll hit a dude.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.458
Here's a challenge, girls.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.125
Go out when nobody's out,
you'll still see guys.

16:05.125 --> 16:08.417
Go to a gas station at midnight,
oh, hey, a guy.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.625
Go to a Walgreen's Pharmacy
at 4:00 in the morning,

16:10.625 --> 16:12.041
oh, look, another guy.

16:12.041 --> 16:12.834
Go take a piss in the woods,
you hear a branch snap,

16:12.834 --> 16:16.583
that's definitely a guy.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.708
Everywhere.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.333
Now, I love my wife.
I adore her.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.375
I think the world of her.
She is my wife.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.583
But there are definitely times
in my life I'm like,

16:27.583 --> 16:29.458
why are you here?

16:29.458 --> 16:31.792
Why?

16:31.792 --> 16:33.125
I'll give you an example.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.792
Any time I watch television
with her.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.458
I spend 100-plus dollars

16:37.458 --> 16:39.000
on an infinite amount
of cable channels a month.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.417
Why?
Can I just buy one for her?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.625
HGTV.

16:43.625 --> 16:46.041
That's all she watches, HGTV.

16:46.041 --> 16:48.667
And I try to watch
this horseshit with her.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.667
Horseshit.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.000
It's manure.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.583
Let me summarize
every HGTV show for you, okay?

16:55.583 --> 16:59.542
Some real estate agent that's
just trying to do their job

16:59.542 --> 17:01.667
is showing around a couple--
a bunch of properties,

17:01.667 --> 17:03.333
and this couple's just
constantly complaining
the whole time.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.165
"Oh, my God,
these floorboards are creaky.

17:05.165 --> 17:07.165
"P.U., it smells in here.
Did somebody die?

17:07.165 --> 17:09.666
"These drapes are old.
How far is the city?

17:09.666 --> 17:12.000
I don't like this commute.
I want to build my man cave."

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
It's like, shut the fuck up
and wait 28 minutes.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.916
You ever seen the show before?
It's gonna be awesome.

17:19.333 --> 17:21.000
I watch these couples,
I'm like, fuck these two,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.458
I hope they're never happy.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.375
I hope they die in a house fire.
Fuck 'em.

17:29.250 --> 17:33.208
That's the show I'd watch,
"House Fire."

17:33.208 --> 17:35.834
13th property, I'd padlock it,
light it, get the fuck...

17:35.834 --> 17:37.834
"Bye, fuck you guys."

17:39.708 --> 17:41.083
But look, at the same time,

17:41.083 --> 17:43.750
my wife does not want
to watch my shows.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.333
Now, I love "Ghost Hunters."
Okay?

17:45.333 --> 17:48.000
Now, here's the thing I know
about every property

17:48.000 --> 17:49.333
that is haunted
in these United States, okay?

17:49.333 --> 17:53.041
It's haunted by a ghost
from the late 1800s

17:53.041 --> 17:55.875
to early 1900s.
That's every ghost.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.125
It's a man in a regal suit

17:57.125 --> 17:59.166
with a bowstring tie
and a derby cap

17:59.166 --> 18:01.208
or a woman
in a ruffled Victorian dress

18:01.208 --> 18:03.083
with a pennant of a silhouetted
daughter

18:03.083 --> 18:04.250
who died at the age of six
of the flu.

18:04.250 --> 18:09.875
It's like, this is...
every morbid ghost.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.708
It's time to update
these ghosts.

18:12.708 --> 18:14.375
And I'll be part
of that movement

18:14.375 --> 18:17.250
'cause I will die in my house
and I will stay in my house,

18:17.250 --> 18:20.250
I will never leave my house
because I paid off

18:20.250 --> 18:21.917
a 30-year mortgage
in that house.

18:21.917 --> 18:26.083
That is my house.
I will haunt this house.

18:26.083 --> 18:29.417
(cheers and applause)

18:29.417 --> 18:31.250
I'll haunt it.

18:31.250 --> 18:34.083
But I'll be cool.
I'll be a cool ghost.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.250
People will be like,
"Yeah, there's a comedian

18:35.250 --> 18:35.959
"that used to live in this house
and, uh,

18:35.959 --> 18:38.417
"it's said he can be seen

18:38.417 --> 18:40.875
"roaming the halls
after midnight

18:40.875 --> 18:42.500
"in boxer briefs?

18:42.500 --> 18:48.000
"He's been described as having
the body of a cubicle worker.

18:49.959 --> 18:51.458
"Anytime he appears,

18:51.458 --> 18:54.083
"the scent of Stouffer's
French bread supreme pizza

18:54.083 --> 18:57.125
"permeates the living space.

18:57.125 --> 18:59.625
"And he can be heard repeating
over and over again,

18:59.625 --> 19:02.291
"'Is the Wi-Fi down?
Is the Wi-Fi down?'

19:02.291 --> 19:05.041
'Oh, fuck you, Time Warner,
the Wi-Fi's down.'"

19:08.291 --> 19:10.542
Now, I'll haunt the house,
but I'll be cool.

19:10.542 --> 19:11.917
I'll be cool with that dad.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.166
'Cause I live in my house now
with my family,

19:13.166 --> 19:15.792
one day a new family come in,
I'll be cool with that dad.

19:15.792 --> 19:19.083
And that dad could confide
to his friends how cool I am.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.125
Like, you know what's weird,
fellas?

19:20.125 --> 19:21.959
I think I have a ghost
in my house

19:21.959 --> 19:23.500
because the kids are in bed,

19:23.500 --> 19:25.875
the wife's in bed, right,
it's late at night.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.667
I got the iPad out,
I'm jerking off,

19:27.667 --> 19:31.875
watching some porn, and
I feel like there's a presence

19:31.875 --> 19:35.166
next to me
jerking off with me.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.834
Oohhh.

19:43.333 --> 19:44.375
Oohhh.

19:51.542 --> 19:52.458
Sorry, Mom.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.542
You know, like, if you have
a piano, it's late at night,

19:58.542 --> 19:59.458
the piano's playing,
"dunh, dunh, dunh!"

19:59.458 --> 20:01.375
Ghost playing the piano,
pack the shit,

20:01.375 --> 20:02.125
we're selling this house,
it's haunted, let's go.

20:02.125 --> 20:04.875
I won't do stuff like that.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.625
I will not.
I'll do cool stuff.

20:06.625 --> 20:07.500
But the dad will be with
the wife, he'll be like,

20:07.500 --> 20:09.333
"You know what, honey,
it's weird,

20:09.333 --> 20:11.000
"we leave
for that party, right?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.208
"I know when we left,
I shut my laptop, okay?

20:14.208 --> 20:17.625
"But then we come home,
my laptop is obviously up

20:17.625 --> 20:20.875
"and there's porn playing
on my laptop.

20:20.875 --> 20:22.375
"And it's not like one window,

20:22.375 --> 20:26.208
"there's like 28 windows
of porn playing on my laptop.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.208
"And I'll shut it in disgust

20:27.208 --> 20:29.792
"and I feel, like,
this male presence

20:29.792 --> 20:31.875
"leave the room
in embarrassment.

20:32.667 --> 20:37.125
And is followed
by a ghost cat."

20:37.125 --> 20:39.959
(laughter and applause)

20:47.458 --> 20:49.583
Now, that's gross.

20:52.041 --> 20:54.750
Over time, I've discovered

20:54.750 --> 20:59.208
that my wife definitely and I
have a different sense of humor.

20:59.208 --> 21:00.667
There are things
I witness that--

21:00.667 --> 21:01.792
sometimes I'm like, oh, I'm glad
I'm with my guy friends

21:01.792 --> 21:04.333
to appreciate this,
and I'll give you an example.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.291
I was in Las Vegas recently,
we go to Mandalay Bay,

21:06.291 --> 21:08.417
there's a lazy river
in the back,

21:08.417 --> 21:10.083
people floating,
laying along the lazy river.

21:10.083 --> 21:11.667
I hit this one bend

21:11.667 --> 21:13.417
and there was this gorgeous,
gorgeous woman laying out

21:13.417 --> 21:17.708
with a bikini
completely to the side, okay?

21:17.708 --> 21:19.458
So, the vagina is out.

21:19.458 --> 21:22.458
Out, the only thing more out
than this vagina

21:22.458 --> 21:25.583
is Clay Aiken.
It is out.

21:25.583 --> 21:26.750
And I am mesmerized,
as any man would be.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.125
Right, I'm a man, I'm floating
through it, it's like,

21:29.125 --> 21:30.375
"Yeah, let's, uh,
let's go to a fight tonight,

21:30.375 --> 21:32.375
"not a 'Cirque' show,
let's go see that fight.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.834
"That's what we'll do, yeah.
We're gonna have a good time.

21:33.834 --> 21:37.375
I'll lock up the tickets,
we're gonna go... will..."

21:44.750 --> 21:46.667
"Guys, come here.

21:46.667 --> 21:50.041
"Look, look, look, look,
look,look, look, look.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.417
"We have to go again.
We have to, it's free.

21:55.417 --> 21:57.542
"Come on. Paid a lot
to see that last night.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.291
Let's go, paddle, paddle,
paddle, paddle, paddle."

22:00.291 --> 22:01.583
We keep lapping this pool

22:01.583 --> 22:06.291
like we had never seen
a vagine in our lives.

22:06.291 --> 22:09.834
I timed it.
Three hours, seven minutes.

22:09.834 --> 22:11.291
That is a "Lord of the Rings"
film in prune hands.

22:11.291 --> 22:13.708
That's what we accomplished
that day.

22:13.708 --> 22:16.750
But I know for a fact
if my wife's in my situation,

22:16.750 --> 22:18.750
she's floating
with her girlfriends,

22:18.750 --> 22:21.250
shoots a bend in the pool,
there's a dude laying out

22:21.250 --> 22:24.166
with his nuts dropped
like a bad transmission,

22:24.166 --> 22:26.166
just a two-piece chilling
outside of a pair

22:26.166 --> 22:30.458
of board shorts
like a hairy chandelier.

22:30.458 --> 22:31.708
She doesn't appreciate that.
"Let's get a mimosa.

22:31.708 --> 22:34.208
"But I'll share it
with you 'cause it's daytime.

22:34.208 --> 22:35.834
"I want to enjoy my day,
I want to enjoy my night

22:35.834 --> 22:37.917
"'cause we're gonna have
so much fun this weekend, girls.

22:37.917 --> 22:39.667
We're gonna have so much..."

22:44.291 --> 22:47.041
"Don't turn around.
Don't, no.

22:47.041 --> 22:49.166
(heavy breathing)

22:49.166 --> 22:52.500
"You can't unsee
what I just saw.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.333
"As a matter of fact,
we're leaving.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.625
"We're not staying here.
I saw this thing.
We're getting--

22:57.625 --> 22:59.792
"Tina, I don't give a shit
what you found on Priceline,

22:59.792 --> 23:01.250
we're getting the fuck out now!"

23:01.250 --> 23:06.125
(cheers and applause)

23:09.291 --> 23:11.667
You get me and my guy friends
floating through a pool,

23:11.667 --> 23:13.417
there's a dude laying out
with his nuts popped out.

23:13.417 --> 23:16.041
"Yeah, let's, uh,
let's get a steak.

23:16.041 --> 23:17.708
"Not a Mexican or Italian,
let's get a steak dinner.

23:17.708 --> 23:19.375
"Let's treat ourselves
like gentlemen.

23:19.375 --> 23:22.542
Let's do it, right?
Like a bunch of g..."

23:31.041 --> 23:32.542
"Guys, come here.

23:32.542 --> 23:35.667
"Look, look, look, look,
look, look, look, look.

23:39.750 --> 23:42.625
"Oh, we have to go again.
It's free, we have to.

23:42.625 --> 23:47.375
"I'm gonna name my boys.
I'm gonna name 'em.

23:47.375 --> 23:50.291
I'll call that one Lance,
that one Armstrong."

23:58.583 --> 24:01.792
I will say this, over the course
of my marriage,

24:01.792 --> 24:05.750
and aspiring to always
be a better husband...

24:05.750 --> 24:08.333
I will say this, the biggest
lesson I've had to learn

24:08.333 --> 24:10.041
in terms of trying
to be a better husband

24:10.041 --> 24:14.250
and a great partner in life is
that my wife is very sensitive.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.166
So, I gotta watch what I say.

24:16.166 --> 24:17.250
As a comic,
I gotta watch what I say,

24:17.250 --> 24:19.834
particularly when it comes
to body image, you know?

24:19.834 --> 24:22.417
She's very sensitive, she's--
you know, we live
in Los Angeles.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.291
She is not some skinny waif
who's gonna drink

24:24.291 --> 24:26.166
juice smoothies
and do yoga all day.

24:26.166 --> 24:28.792
No, this is a girl
from Minnesota.

24:28.792 --> 24:31.250
This is why I married her.
This is the kind of girl

24:31.250 --> 24:32.917
I could walk
into Cheesecake Factory with.

24:32.917 --> 24:34.959
As soon as we walk in,
we'll look at each other like,

24:34.959 --> 24:37.083
whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.458
We gonna fuck up that cake?

24:39.458 --> 24:42.208
(cheers and applause)

24:46.417 --> 24:48.417
We're like people
at a dog pound.

24:48.417 --> 24:49.792
It's like,
"You're coming home with us.

24:49.792 --> 24:52.041
"You're coming home with us.
You're coming home with us.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.708
I want to take them all home."

24:54.708 --> 24:57.625
So, here's the lesson
I had to learn, okay?

24:57.625 --> 24:59.625
The other day, I was sitting
on my couch, watching TV,

24:59.625 --> 25:00.792
she comes in with a laundry
basket full of clothes

25:00.792 --> 25:04.417
from the dryer and dumps it
on the couch next to me,

25:04.417 --> 25:06.333
which means...
we're folding laundry?

25:06.333 --> 25:08.917
What the fuck?

25:08.917 --> 25:10.500
Now, I gotta preface this
next part with letting you know,

25:10.500 --> 25:14.000
my wife has got
a big ass, okay?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.667
I am not speaking out of school.

25:15.667 --> 25:17.667
She'd be the first to tell you
or admit it, she got a big butt.

25:17.667 --> 25:18.875
Like, if you saw my wife
from behind, you'd be like,

25:18.875 --> 25:21.834
"Oh, I bet she's married to
a professional athlete."

25:25.125 --> 25:28.708
You got it?
You get what I...

25:28.708 --> 25:30.625
Like, if you saw my wife
from behind,

25:30.625 --> 25:31.333
you'd be like, "Oh, I bet
she's married to somebody

25:31.333 --> 25:34.458
that always votes Democrat."

25:35.708 --> 25:38.667
(man)
- Whoo!
- I don't think you guys--

25:38.667 --> 25:41.834
okay, um, like if you saw
my wife from behind,

25:41.834 --> 25:42.750
you'd be like, "Oh, I bet
she's married to somebody

25:42.750 --> 25:47.208
that owns at least one
Tyler Perry DVD."

25:48.417 --> 25:50.542
(man)
- Whoo!

25:50.542 --> 25:51.417
- A black guy, he got it.
A black guy.

25:51.417 --> 25:54.542
There we go.
Black guy.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.834
So, she has a big ass.

25:58.834 --> 26:00.834
So, I go in this laundry pile,
the first thing I pick out

26:00.834 --> 26:02.041
are these cut-off sweat shorts
that she wears.

26:02.041 --> 26:04.500
I wasn't even thinking,
just reflexively this comes out.

26:04.500 --> 26:09.333
I hold them up, I go,
"Whoa!"

26:13.291 --> 26:15.834
Everything got quiet,
everything.

26:15.834 --> 26:18.917
Even the guy golfing on TV
was like...

26:28.583 --> 26:31.625
The way I said "whoa"
is not the way any woman

26:31.625 --> 26:34.458
would like to hear
her waistline described.

26:34.458 --> 26:37.000
The way I said "whoa"
was the way you say "whoa"

26:37.000 --> 26:40.250
when you see the Grand Canyon
for the first time.

26:40.250 --> 26:46.291
Whoa!

26:46.291 --> 26:50.583
Not pants.
Not pants.

26:50.583 --> 26:51.750
So, I know I messed up, right?

26:51.750 --> 26:55.375
And I slowly, slowly
look over at my wife

26:55.375 --> 26:56.917
and I see the tear
develop there.

26:56.917 --> 26:58.500
(audience)
- Aww.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.750
- Now, it didn't drop,
so it's not official, okay?

27:00.750 --> 27:04.750
We've all had tears peek-a-boo,
they go back in.

27:04.750 --> 27:07.625
So, to me, unless
it's moonwalking on that cheek,

27:07.625 --> 27:10.041
I don't give a shit.
Your feelings ain't hurt.

27:10.041 --> 27:12.000
It's not a real tear.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.708
But I know I messed up.

27:13.708 --> 27:14.625
And I'm like,
"I'm so sorry, I love you.

27:14.625 --> 27:17.208
"I love you so much,
I wasn't think--"

27:17.208 --> 27:18.625
"Get out.
Get out of this house."

27:18.625 --> 27:21.375
"I got it.
I'm gonna fold it all.

27:21.375 --> 27:22.625
"Go get some fresh air.
That's what you should--

27:22.625 --> 27:24.083
"Take a lap around
the neighborhood.

27:24.083 --> 27:25.625
"Take a long lap around that--
take a few laps,

27:25.625 --> 27:27.792
"get those laps that are...

27:27.792 --> 27:29.542
"I'm not saying
you need the exercise.

27:29.542 --> 27:31.458
"That's not what I was...

27:31.458 --> 27:32.834
"You know I love you
and I love your a...

27:32.834 --> 27:34.875
"You think about this.
A few years ago,

27:34.875 --> 27:37.333
"girls spent thousands
of dollars on surgery

27:37.333 --> 27:38.834
"to get fat sucked
out of their ass.

27:38.834 --> 27:41.542
"Now they get surgery
to get fat put in their ass.

27:41.542 --> 27:43.083
"And you don't need it 'cause
you already got the fa--

27:43.083 --> 27:45.083
I'm gonna shut the fuck up."

27:45.083 --> 27:47.458
(exhales)

27:47.458 --> 27:50.583
(laughter and applause)

27:51.750 --> 27:54.500
That's when my wife walked over
to the laundry pile

27:54.500 --> 27:56.083
and she picked up
my boxer briefs

27:56.083 --> 27:59.542
and she goes, "Medium."

28:06.041 --> 28:10.875
And that's when I learned
that those tears are real.

28:10.875 --> 28:14.458
It's a real tear.
It does count.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.834
Now, my wife is sensitive.
I am not sensitive.

28:19.834 --> 28:22.792
My guy friends are certainly
not sensitive.

28:22.792 --> 28:25.000
And if I could encapsulate
an event that occurred recently

28:25.000 --> 28:27.125
where something is socially
acceptable

28:27.125 --> 28:30.125
to a group of my guy friends
and certainly not to my wife,

28:30.125 --> 28:31.625
it would be this.

28:31.625 --> 28:33.500
A few weeks ago, my wife
asked to borrow my phone.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.333
I said, "Sure, take it.
No problem."

28:34.333 --> 28:36.708
Her battery died.
She walks away.

28:36.708 --> 28:38.000
Every guy's worst nightmare
happened to me.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.041
Sexual text messages
start popping up on my phone.

28:42.041 --> 28:44.125
She stopped dead in her tracks,
she walks over, she goes,

28:44.125 --> 28:44.917
"What the hell is this?"

28:44.917 --> 28:46.708
I take it,
I'm like, "Oh, shit.

28:46.708 --> 28:50.166
"Oh, God, oh, oh.
I'm so sorry.

28:50.166 --> 28:52.542
"I'm sorry you had to see this,
this is so bad.

28:52.542 --> 28:53.667
"But you're reading
the text messages,

28:53.667 --> 28:55.667
"you're not reading
the names.

28:55.667 --> 28:59.125
"These are my guy friends.

28:59.125 --> 29:02.458
"You see, I'm having a very bad
Fantasy Football Sunday

29:02.458 --> 29:04.041
"because I'm losing so bad,

29:04.041 --> 29:07.875
they're telling me all the shit
they're gonna do to my body."

29:09.875 --> 29:12.083
Yeah, "Steve, I can't wait
to bend you over

29:12.083 --> 29:13.708
and fuck you straight up
in that wet pussy of yours."

29:13.708 --> 29:17.083
Okay, I don't have a pussy,

29:17.083 --> 29:19.083
and if I did,
it wouldn't get wet from losing.

29:19.083 --> 29:21.750
I have no idea what that means.
That's confusing.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.417
"Steve, I'm just
letting you know

29:23.417 --> 29:26.625
that when I fuck you like this,
this is strictly physical."

29:29.000 --> 29:31.250
"There's no emotions involved,
so don't try to kiss me

29:31.250 --> 29:33.041
or make eye contact with me."

29:34.708 --> 29:36.417
"You will never meet
my friends or family.

29:36.417 --> 29:37.708
You're my fuck toy."

29:37.708 --> 29:39.583
That's not nice.
You don't...

29:39.583 --> 29:41.917
don't talk to someone like that.

29:41.917 --> 29:43.834
"Steve, I wish I could
scientifically prove

29:43.834 --> 29:45.583
"I could get
a man's face pregnant

29:45.583 --> 29:47.917
when I blow my load
in your mouth."

29:50.417 --> 29:52.417
It's creative.

29:52.417 --> 29:54.083
She goes...

29:54.083 --> 29:56.583
"Is this what you
and your friends do?"

29:57.875 --> 29:59.667
"Yes?
Yes, yes.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.166
"Do you guys text?
You don't...

30:01.166 --> 30:02.959
What do-- what do
you girls text each other?"

30:02.959 --> 30:07.208
She's like, "Baby pictures
and recipes."

30:07.208 --> 30:08.792
"That is not on this phone.

30:08.792 --> 30:10.917
"There are no baby pictures or--

30:10.917 --> 30:14.792
"Oh, here's a recipe for...
semen.

30:16.959 --> 30:19.083
"Steve, this season has been
such a debacle for you

30:19.083 --> 30:20.542
"that for the remaining
few weeks,

30:20.542 --> 30:21.792
"I'll make it nice on you.

30:21.792 --> 30:23.708
"I will refrain
from touching myself

30:23.708 --> 30:25.542
"and keep a steady diet
of pineapple.

30:25.542 --> 30:27.875
"I will develop...

30:27.875 --> 30:30.083
"such a sweet, heavy load
that when I dump it on you,

30:30.083 --> 30:32.250
"it will resemble the end
of the movie 'Carrie,'

30:32.250 --> 30:34.166
"but instead of blood,
it will be my semen

30:34.166 --> 30:36.500
"drowning you
and your entire township.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.333
Hashtag: dessert time."

30:38.333 --> 30:39.959
What the fuck?

30:41.959 --> 30:44.792
(exhales)

30:48.041 --> 30:50.667
She goes,
"Why is this happening?"

30:50.667 --> 30:54.041
"I had a bad draft?"

30:54.041 --> 30:54.875
She's like,
"You're disgusting."

30:54.875 --> 30:58.834
I'm like, "I'm the fucking
victim."

30:59.834 --> 31:02.625
Well, no easy segue
to this one.

31:02.625 --> 31:05.542
We have a daughter now.

31:05.542 --> 31:06.166
Sorry.

31:08.834 --> 31:11.041
Got a little girl.
Got a little boy.

31:11.041 --> 31:12.959
I wanna do my best now
as a father

31:12.959 --> 31:14.959
to impart upon them
some words of wisdom,

31:14.959 --> 31:15.959
some life lessons,
some shortcuts.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.500
Look, I know they're not
gonna listen to me.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.542
They're gonna make up
their own...

31:19.542 --> 31:21.041
But, look, it's not gonna
prevent me from trying

31:21.041 --> 31:24.166
to be a good pop
and pass down some knowledge.

31:24.166 --> 31:25.083
You know, I'm 40,
I learned most of my lessons.

31:25.083 --> 31:27.708
I definitely still have
some to learn.

31:27.708 --> 31:29.375
But I like to pass it down.
Like, how old are you,
buddy, right here?

31:29.375 --> 31:30.792
22?

31:30.792 --> 31:33.834
You look good for 22.

31:35.708 --> 31:37.834
Jesus Christ.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.708
Are you a smoker?
God damn, dude.

31:42.708 --> 31:45.333
Now, what's your name?

31:45.333 --> 31:46.834
- Ken.
- Ken?

31:46.834 --> 31:48.583
All right, first off,
let's lose the attitude, Ken.

31:48.583 --> 31:50.041
I don't know where
that's coming from.

31:50.041 --> 31:53.041
Ken, enjoy your 20s.
20s are the best.

31:53.041 --> 31:55.000
People will say,
"College are the best years

31:55.000 --> 31:57.041
of your life."
I absolutely disagree.

31:57.041 --> 31:57.375
Your 20s are.

31:57.375 --> 32:00.083
You're...

32:00.083 --> 32:03.417
Take as many pictures
of yourself as you can right now

32:03.417 --> 32:06.333
because the rest of your life,
you'll be trying to get back

32:06.333 --> 32:08.041
to what you have right now.

32:08.041 --> 32:09.792
If you wake up and look at
yourself in the mirror and go,

32:09.792 --> 32:13.750
"Oh, fuck,"
kill yourself now.

32:13.750 --> 32:17.000
Right now, you are
the '96 Bulls.

32:18.291 --> 32:19.583
Ten-- Yeah.

32:19.583 --> 32:22.083
(cheering)

32:25.250 --> 32:30.542
Ten years from now,
you're Jordan on the Wizards.

32:30.542 --> 32:32.291
It's gonna get sad.

32:35.917 --> 32:37.417
There's a blissful ignorance
to your 20s.

32:37.417 --> 32:41.917
For example, you most likely
do not know what kale is yet.

32:41.917 --> 32:43.959
Exactly.
Kale's not on your grocery list.

32:43.959 --> 32:45.959
At 22, you don't even have
a grocery list.

32:45.959 --> 32:46.917
Here's your grocery list at 22:

32:46.917 --> 32:50.750
Chipotle--
that's your grocery list.

32:50.750 --> 32:53.166
Kale is a rich,
nutrient-ridden leaf.

32:53.166 --> 32:54.125
It's overpriced,
it tastes like shit.

32:54.125 --> 32:56.083
But once you turn 30,
you will eat kale

32:56.083 --> 33:00.083
because you're getting
back on track, baby!

33:01.917 --> 33:04.166
I can't stand people
in their early 30s

33:04.166 --> 33:05.834
who are like,
"I'm eating right,

33:05.834 --> 33:07.041
"I've been working out
for six months.

33:07.041 --> 33:08.000
I'm in the best shape
of my life."

33:08.000 --> 33:10.917
That ship has sailed,
my friend.

33:10.917 --> 33:12.041
The best shape
of any of our lives,

33:12.041 --> 33:15.792
between the ages
of four to eight years old.

33:15.792 --> 33:17.959
That is the best shape
of your life.

33:17.959 --> 33:20.667
You climb a tree, you fall down,
you cry for two minutes.

33:20.667 --> 33:23.041
Next you know, you're going
down stairs in a cardboard box.

33:23.041 --> 33:24.333
That's unbelievable shape.

33:26.834 --> 33:29.417
Okay, you-- you on Tinder?

33:29.417 --> 33:34.041
Look at me like a fucking man.
Are you on Tinder?

33:34.041 --> 33:36.250
No.
I respect you.

33:37.625 --> 33:39.000
As a fellow, I will say this.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
I find Tinder to be
very condescending.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
The audacity of some
of you guys

33:43.000 --> 33:45.125
to just sit there
and visually swipe on faces

33:45.125 --> 33:47.125
dictating who and who is not
fuck-worthy

33:47.125 --> 33:49.625
in your little kingdoms
on your phone.

33:49.625 --> 33:50.834
If you have
the balls to use Tinder

33:50.834 --> 33:52.417
in the privacy of your phone,

33:52.417 --> 33:54.041
you should have the balls
to use Tinder in real life.

33:54.041 --> 33:55.875
Go to a bar, tap a girl
on her shoulder,

33:55.875 --> 33:59.000
wait for her to turn around.
"Oh, Jesus Christ."

34:00.250 --> 34:05.041
"Oh, God.
This is the worst Chili's ever!"

34:07.625 --> 34:09.166
(cheers and applause)

34:18.041 --> 34:20.375
Ken, are you single?
Yeah.

34:20.375 --> 34:21.166
Listen, um...

34:23.458 --> 34:25.875
Do me this favor, and I really
mean this as a fella.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.041
You got your whole life
ahead of you,

34:27.041 --> 34:29.208
starting to date, whatever,

34:29.208 --> 34:31.041
you've got some girls on,
whatever.

34:31.041 --> 34:32.125
Look, never, ever, ever
look at a girl

34:32.125 --> 34:34.375
and say, "That girl
is out of my league."

34:34.375 --> 34:37.708
You always give love a shot,
always give love a shot.

34:37.708 --> 34:41.000
Very few girls are truly out of
your league, looks-wise, okay?

34:41.000 --> 34:43.125
This is what I mean.
Um, go to a hot spot,

34:43.125 --> 34:44.041
find a girl you like,
look at her and go,

34:44.041 --> 34:46.417
"Aw, she's stunning,
she'd never..."

34:46.417 --> 34:48.417
Stop yourself.
Then you look at that girl

34:48.417 --> 34:52.375
and you picture that girl
as an Applebee's waitress.

34:53.542 --> 34:55.917
And if you can picture
that girl working at Applebee's,

34:55.917 --> 34:59.083
you got a fucking shot.

35:02.375 --> 35:04.417
Every Applebee's...

35:04.417 --> 35:07.083
every Applebee's
has one hottie, okay?

35:07.083 --> 35:09.083
And very few women
are too stunning

35:09.083 --> 35:10.417
to work at Applebee's.
Here's what I mean.

35:10.417 --> 35:12.792
Jennifer Lawrence,
she's stunning, she's beautiful,

35:12.792 --> 35:14.542
she's a movie star,
she's talented.

35:14.542 --> 35:15.834
"Silver Linings Playbook,"

35:15.834 --> 35:17.083
"Hunger Games,"
she's got it all.

35:17.083 --> 35:19.917
You think without that talent,
she's working at Applebee's?

35:19.917 --> 35:23.417
Oh, you better believe it.

35:23.417 --> 35:26.375
Reese Witherspoon, you see her
working at Applebee's?

35:26.375 --> 35:27.542
Yeah.

35:27.542 --> 35:30.750
Probably a district manager
within nine months.

35:30.750 --> 35:32.500
Fast track.

35:33.792 --> 35:35.208
Angelina Jolie.

35:35.208 --> 35:37.291
You see her kicking open
a kitchen door

35:37.291 --> 35:39.166
with some sizzling fajitas
in tow trying to upsell you

35:39.166 --> 35:42.458
on a piña colada
during happy hour?

35:42.458 --> 35:44.291
Fuck, no.

35:44.291 --> 35:47.959
Angelina Jolie has never
and will never step foot

35:47.959 --> 35:50.959
inside of an Applebee's.

35:50.959 --> 35:52.667
So, you're sitting there
saying to yourself,

35:52.667 --> 35:53.959
"I got a shot with most girls,

35:53.959 --> 35:55.583
but probably not Angelina
Jolie."

35:55.583 --> 35:58.291
And, Ken, you are correct.

35:58.291 --> 36:01.792
But know this.
For every Angelina Jolie,

36:01.792 --> 36:03.333
there is a Billy Bob Thornton.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.291
(cheers and applause)

36:13.500 --> 36:17.166
So, get out there
and be that Billy Bob Thornton.

36:17.166 --> 36:21.417
And, Ken, you are halfway there.

36:25.959 --> 36:29.375
So sorry.
What a nice guy.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.000
Um, you ever been
in a bar fight?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.834
No?
Do me this favor,

36:32.834 --> 36:34.166
and I truly mean this,

36:34.166 --> 36:37.625
never, ever, ever in a bar
fight a man

36:37.625 --> 36:39.333
in his mid-30s or older, ever.

36:39.333 --> 36:41.959
Because you're in a bar
to meet girls.

36:41.959 --> 36:45.250
He's in a bar
because he's angry.

36:45.250 --> 36:47.041
Right?

36:47.041 --> 36:50.708
Shit didn't work out
the way he thought it was gonna.

36:50.708 --> 36:51.959
So, when you find yourself
on the floor of a bar

36:51.959 --> 36:54.291
getting your face rocked,

36:54.291 --> 36:55.834
like, "Fuck, this guy's
got a lot of rage."

36:55.834 --> 36:58.166
Oh, yes, he does.

37:03.041 --> 37:05.125
And he ain't punching you,

37:05.125 --> 37:07.708
he's punching a 401(k),
retirement,

37:07.708 --> 37:09.333
college tuition, divorce.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.542
He's taking prescription pills
with a side effect

37:11.542 --> 37:12.792
of explosive diarrhea.

37:12.792 --> 37:15.583
That's a dangerous line to walk
every day of your life.

37:15.583 --> 37:16.583
He's punching you,

37:16.583 --> 37:19.250
"I'm not good enough
to be Amazon Prime?"

37:19.250 --> 37:22.500
Nothing to do with you.
Nothing.

37:24.708 --> 37:29.417
Well, these are some
honest-to-goodness true,
absolute lessons

37:29.417 --> 37:31.417
I want to instill
upon my children.

37:31.417 --> 37:34.333
I want to tell them,
live by the golden rule.

37:34.333 --> 37:35.083
Treat others as you'd want
to be treated.

37:35.083 --> 37:36.458
There is no joke there.

37:36.458 --> 37:40.250
I tell them, always tell
the truth, be honest.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.083
Lies fester, they beget lies,

37:42.083 --> 37:43.417
you gotta keep track
of the web of lies.

37:43.417 --> 37:47.125
It's never worth it.
Tell the truth, be honest.

37:47.125 --> 37:51.417
Unless it's the beginning
of a relationship.

37:51.417 --> 37:53.792
The first two months
in any relationship,

37:53.792 --> 37:56.208
you're allowed to lie.
And I'll tell you why, okay?

37:56.208 --> 37:58.291
My wife and I recently,
we were going to Las Vegas.

37:58.291 --> 38:01.083
There's a young couple
at the gate all over each other,

38:01.083 --> 38:01.792
so you know it's not
gonna work out.

38:01.792 --> 38:04.250
And, uh...

38:04.250 --> 38:06.291
the guy gets up, he goes,
"Baby, baby, I gotta get

38:06.291 --> 38:07.792
"my shoes shined, so I'll be
back in a few minutes,

38:07.792 --> 38:09.083
but it will be a few minutes."
She goes, "It's okay."

38:09.083 --> 38:11.250
And he walks away, he goes,
"Oh, shoot, you know something?

38:11.250 --> 38:12.583
"I'm gonna get a sandwich
too to eat,

38:12.583 --> 38:13.667
"so shoeshine, sandwich,
I'll be back.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.125
Text me if you want
something to eat too, okay?"

38:16.125 --> 38:17.166
She goes, "Great."
He walks away.

38:17.166 --> 38:19.208
"Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.
I gotta get a magazine

38:19.208 --> 38:20.542
"to read on the plane too,
so shoeshine,

38:20.542 --> 38:21.583
"sandwich, magazine.
Text me, I'll get it.

38:21.583 --> 38:24.750
It's gonna be a few."
She goes, "It's fine."

38:24.750 --> 38:26.250
I go, "He's gotta take a shit."

38:26.250 --> 38:28.125
My wife hits me and goes,
"Will you shut up?"

38:28.125 --> 38:29.083
I'm like,
"He's gotta take a shit.

38:29.083 --> 38:31.500
Just say you gotta take
a shit, dude!"

38:31.500 --> 38:35.125
But you can't say
"I've gotta take a shit"

38:35.125 --> 38:38.208
five weeks into
a fresh relationship.

38:38.208 --> 38:40.125
You can't be honest.
You can't tell the truth.

38:40.125 --> 38:41.125
You can't be the guy
that's like,

38:41.125 --> 38:43.875
"Baby, baby, baby!
We did it up last night--

38:43.875 --> 38:45.500
"Jäger, Patrón, Fireball,
back to Jäger.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.959
"Then all those
Stellas and Blue Moons.

38:47.959 --> 38:48.792
"Then you took me
to Denny's.

38:48.792 --> 38:50.291
"I got those
spicy buffalo tenders,

38:50.291 --> 38:52.291
"a French onion soup,
a flapjack,

38:52.291 --> 38:54.417
"three sausage links,
and five orange juices.

38:54.417 --> 38:56.333
"I gotta tell ya,
I got a timebomb brewing

38:56.333 --> 38:58.166
"in this tum-tum right now,
okay?

38:58.166 --> 39:00.083
"So, what Daddy's gotta do,

39:00.083 --> 39:01.458
"I've got to Macarena
over that restroom

39:01.458 --> 39:03.834
"and rock a deuce.
'Cause if I get 30,000 up

39:03.834 --> 39:06.125
"in that bird, whatever I do
in the back of that bird,

39:06.125 --> 39:08.458
it could be considered an act
of terrorism."

39:16.500 --> 39:18.542
I've got to tell you,
you guys really

39:18.542 --> 39:21.000
get behind
a good shit joke.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.458
Thank you.

39:24.667 --> 39:25.291
(chuckles)

39:25.291 --> 39:27.834
I want to tell my kids,

39:27.834 --> 39:32.083
"Don't go through life being
100% prejudiced, okay?

39:32.083 --> 39:34.500
You can be 25% prejudiced."

39:34.500 --> 39:36.125
And I'll tell everybody in
this room right now,

39:36.125 --> 39:37.583
I am prejudiced, okay?

39:37.583 --> 39:39.041
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it
and pretend I'm not.

39:39.041 --> 39:40.000
I'm prejudiced.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.417
And it's not racial.
Not racial at all.

39:41.417 --> 39:43.625
I'll give you
an example, okay?

39:43.625 --> 39:45.708
If I drive in the left lane
of a highway

39:45.708 --> 39:49.166
and you ride my ass in
the left lane of that highway,

39:49.166 --> 39:51.458
my actions are now gonna
become dependent

39:51.458 --> 39:54.458
upon your make and model.
I will prejudge you.

39:55.583 --> 39:58.500
If you ride my ass
in the left lane of a highway

39:58.500 --> 40:01.667
in a Honda Civic--
a Honda Civic--

40:01.667 --> 40:06.083
you can go fuck yourself
in your Honda Civic.

40:06.083 --> 40:08.208
You have not
worked hard enough in life

40:08.208 --> 40:09.208
for me to be an inconvenience
to you

40:09.208 --> 40:11.917
in a goddamned Civic.

40:11.917 --> 40:13.208
Oh, now you're in a hurry
to get shit done?

40:13.208 --> 40:15.667
Now you've got priorities?

40:15.667 --> 40:17.750
No, no, no, no, no.

40:17.750 --> 40:19.708
What average event
do you have to get to

40:19.708 --> 40:21.792
in an average car that quickly
in a Civic?

40:21.792 --> 40:25.291
Stay in line, asshole.
No one's missing you.

40:32.417 --> 40:35.750
You ride my ass in the left lane
of a highway in a minivan?

40:35.750 --> 40:36.417
You shouldn't
be in the left lane

40:36.417 --> 40:39.250
of a highway in a minivan.

40:39.250 --> 40:40.583
You have children
in that minivan,

40:40.583 --> 40:42.250
and if you don't have
children,

40:42.250 --> 40:44.417
you shouldn't have bought
a minivan, you pervert.

40:46.625 --> 40:47.458
You ride my ass in
the left lane

40:47.458 --> 40:50.750
of a highway
in a Toyota Prius?

40:50.750 --> 40:54.792
(mocking voice)
Well, shouldn't you be
on a bicycle?

41:03.458 --> 41:05.458
You ride my ass in
the left lane of a highway

41:05.458 --> 41:08.708
in a Porsche, Lamborghini,
Jaguar, Ferrari...

41:08.708 --> 41:10.458
respect.

41:11.834 --> 41:13.000
Let me get out of your way

41:13.000 --> 41:16.625
so you can keep doing
some cool shit, my friend.

41:16.625 --> 41:18.417
Probably in a rush to get
to an orgy.

41:18.417 --> 41:21.333
Go fuck 'em all for me.
You're my hero!

41:21.959 --> 41:23.750
You never use condoms!

41:28.083 --> 41:29.458
You ride my ass in
the left lane

41:29.458 --> 41:30.792
of a highway in a Kia?

41:33.041 --> 41:34.625
A Kia?

41:34.625 --> 41:35.792
I am dousing you
with windshield wiper fluid.

41:35.792 --> 41:40.625
I am pulling that bitch back
and I am hosing you.

41:40.625 --> 41:42.375
I'm watching you
in the rearview going,

41:42.375 --> 41:44.792
"Is it raining out?"
"No. I hate you."

41:45.500 --> 41:46.667
You bought a car
because of

41:46.667 --> 41:50.750
a hip-hop dancing hamster,
you moron?

41:58.500 --> 41:59.708
You ride my ass in
the left lane

41:59.708 --> 42:00.667
of a highway
in a pickup truck?

42:00.667 --> 42:04.166
I'm getting the fuck
off the freeway...

42:04.166 --> 42:05.333
because I am not waking up
hog-tied

42:05.333 --> 42:07.959
in a wheat field
next to Ken.

42:07.959 --> 42:08.792
Fuck that.

42:15.458 --> 42:16.917
As my kids get older,

42:16.917 --> 42:18.792
I want to tell them,
"Have faith, don't have faith.

42:18.792 --> 42:21.458
That is entirely up to you
as you get older."

42:21.458 --> 42:22.834
I grew up with faith.
I still have faith.

42:22.834 --> 42:25.375
I believe, uh, it's a good way
to go through life,

42:25.375 --> 42:26.166
being held accountable
by your actions

42:26.166 --> 42:28.375
by a higher power.

42:28.375 --> 42:30.208
If I could break it down
to a microcosm,

42:30.208 --> 42:31.917
sneeze next to somebody
of faith.

42:31.917 --> 42:33.000
It's reassuring.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.417
"Ah-choo."
"God bless you."

42:34.417 --> 42:35.750
They're saying,
"Hey, don't get sick on us."

42:35.750 --> 42:37.250
Selfishly what
they're saying is,

42:37.250 --> 42:39.875
"Please don't start
a plague."

42:39.875 --> 42:43.333
But I'll take that any day over
sneezing next to an atheist.

42:43.333 --> 42:45.667
"Ah-choo."
"No one can help you."

42:49.917 --> 42:53.625
I want to tell my kids,
"Be accepting of everybody."

42:53.625 --> 42:54.625
You know, uh,
I think everybody has the right

42:54.625 --> 42:58.500
to do whatever it is
that makes them happy.

42:58.500 --> 42:59.708
I was having a conversation

42:59.708 --> 43:01.333
with a friend of mine
the other day,

43:01.333 --> 43:02.708
and the reason
I think this is because

43:02.708 --> 43:04.708
he's of the mindset you can
become gay.

43:04.708 --> 43:06.166
I'm of the mindset
you are born gay.

43:06.166 --> 43:09.333
And we went back and forth,
and we had this little debate.

43:09.333 --> 43:10.542
And then he brought up
this rumor

43:10.542 --> 43:14.000
that back in the day,
Mick Jagger banged David Bowie,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.750
or vice-versa, depending who
you're a bigger fan of.

43:16.750 --> 43:18.959
You know,
like, whoever's behind.

43:18.959 --> 43:20.667
It's up to you.
It's...

43:21.917 --> 43:24.417
Because I totally get it.
Mick Jagger's touring the world.

43:24.417 --> 43:26.041
He's banging "10s"
after decades,

43:26.041 --> 43:27.041
and eventually he's like,

43:27.041 --> 43:28.250
"I'm tired of hot
chicks.

43:28.250 --> 43:29.834
I'm gonna fuck
a hot dude."

43:29.834 --> 43:33.875
I was like, "Uh, I don't
get that at all."

43:33.875 --> 43:36.500
'Cause I'll tell you this,
I love eating pizza.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.875
I could eat pizza for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner

43:38.875 --> 43:41.542
seven days a week,
365 days a year.

43:41.542 --> 43:43.500
And I don't believe
on day 366,

43:43.500 --> 43:45.917
I pick up
a slice of pizza and go,

43:45.917 --> 43:48.458
"I cannot eat one more slice
of pizza.

43:48.458 --> 43:51.417
It's time to fuck dudes."

43:52.208 --> 43:54.917
I don't see it.

43:58.667 --> 44:03.333
This has disappeared.
It's back.

44:04.291 --> 44:06.542
Sit the fuck down.

44:12.375 --> 44:13.291
I want to tell my kids
something

44:13.291 --> 44:14.834
my father told me when
I was very young.

44:14.834 --> 44:16.375
My father
grew up in New York City.

44:16.375 --> 44:17.458
He was surrounded
by everybody,

44:17.458 --> 44:19.291
friends with everybody,
still is to this day.

44:19.291 --> 44:21.166
And I'll always remember this.
He said, "Steve, you never judge

44:21.166 --> 44:22.458
"the people as a whole.

44:22.458 --> 44:23.792
"You always judge
the individual.

44:23.792 --> 44:25.959
That's how you go through life.
That is how you make friends."

44:25.959 --> 44:26.708
And I'll tell my kids
the same thing.

44:26.708 --> 44:28.708
And I'm gonna tell them this.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.041
"Look, this is just
an example, guys.

44:30.041 --> 44:32.667
An example, okay?"
I'm gonna tell them,

44:32.667 --> 44:34.667
"You can't hate
all Jewish people."

44:34.667 --> 44:36.708
That's awful.
Of course you can hate

44:36.708 --> 44:38.333
a Jewish person,
if you have

44:38.333 --> 44:39.917
a bad experience
with that individual.

44:39.917 --> 44:43.041
But it's absolutely unfair
to hate all of...

44:43.041 --> 44:44.000
Wall Street,
the banking industry,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.667
the recording industry,
television, film,

44:46.667 --> 44:47.875
Hollywood itself,
doctors, lawyers, etc.,

44:47.875 --> 44:50.458
our legal system,
the Federal Reserve,

44:50.458 --> 44:52.333
any sports commissioner,
mass media,

44:52.333 --> 44:53.208
any landlord
or property owner,

44:53.208 --> 44:55.000
southern Connecticut,
northern Jersey,

44:55.000 --> 44:56.166
Upper East Side
or West Side of New York City,

44:56.166 --> 44:58.875
the whole state of Florida,
you can't hate all that.

45:06.917 --> 45:09.375
And sometimes I do that joke,
and people are like,

45:09.375 --> 45:10.834
"Oh, he's anti-Semitic.
He hates Jews."

45:10.834 --> 45:13.041
No, I don't.
They have a good sense of humor.

45:13.041 --> 45:14.708
And, look, I love Jews.
I work with Jews.

45:14.708 --> 45:16.583
My manager's Jewish,
my agent's Jewish,

45:16.583 --> 45:17.750
my publisher's Jewish,

45:17.750 --> 45:20.375
my lawyer's Jewish.
You get it.

45:21.959 --> 45:24.583
Now, this is the second
to last lesson

45:24.583 --> 45:26.041
I want to impart
upon my kids.

45:26.041 --> 45:28.250
I want to tell them,
"Have a bartender's year."

45:28.250 --> 45:29.417
And that means you listen

45:29.417 --> 45:30.500
more than you talk
about yourself.

45:30.500 --> 45:31.917
Hopefully, that'll get you
some great friends.

45:31.917 --> 45:34.083
Hopefully,
that'll get you this friend,

45:34.083 --> 45:35.834
because I believe this is
the best friend

45:35.834 --> 45:36.583
you can have
when you're growing up.

45:36.583 --> 45:37.875
Not only that,
I believe

45:37.875 --> 45:40.875
this is the greatest human being
in our country.

45:40.875 --> 45:42.834
I'll tell you
who it is right now--

45:42.834 --> 45:45.208
fat white girls.

45:45.208 --> 45:47.542
Fat... white... girls.

45:47.542 --> 45:49.041
And I know this P.C. climate
we live in,

45:49.041 --> 45:50.875
where everybody's a victim,
and somebody in this room

45:50.875 --> 45:52.708
right now is going,
"Oh, he's being mean!

45:52.708 --> 45:54.875
He's being cruel."
No, I'm not.

45:54.875 --> 45:57.291
I'm being celebratory.
I'm going on the books,

45:57.291 --> 45:59.875
on record, and letting everybody
in this room know right now:

45:59.875 --> 46:02.792
I love 'em fat.
I love 'em white.

46:02.792 --> 46:06.041
And you'd best believe,
I love 'em girls.

46:10.875 --> 46:13.291
Fat white girls are awesome!

46:13.291 --> 46:16.417
Fat white girls are at
the forefront of civil rights.

46:16.417 --> 46:17.917
Whatever fat white girls do,

46:17.917 --> 46:19.583
it takes the rest
of the country

46:19.583 --> 46:21.542
a few years
to catch up to them.

46:22.500 --> 46:24.917
Which sounds ironic.
I'll give you that.

46:28.458 --> 46:29.875
(taps mic)

46:31.917 --> 46:35.041
Let's all be honest...
honest with each other.

46:35.041 --> 46:38.291
20 years ago, 20 years ago,
nobody's fuckin' black guys.

46:38.291 --> 46:41.667
20 years ago, nobody's fucking
black guys publicly.

46:41.667 --> 46:43.291
But 20 years ago,

46:43.291 --> 46:44.875
who's parading around
downtown

46:44.875 --> 46:47.250
with a care in the world,
fuckin' a black guy?

46:47.250 --> 46:50.000
A fat white girl.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.542
Flash forward to today,
who's fucking black guys?

46:53.542 --> 46:56.333
Everybody's fucking
black guys!

46:56.333 --> 46:59.542
Well, thank you,
fat white girls.

47:00.792 --> 47:02.959
10 years ago,
you're a little gay boy.

47:02.959 --> 47:04.667
You want your tongue pierced
at Claire's.

47:04.667 --> 47:05.834
Well, you can't
go with the football team.

47:05.834 --> 47:07.667
Well, who's gonna take
your little gay ass to the mall?

47:07.667 --> 47:08.917
I guess your first friend

47:08.917 --> 47:12.667
from junior high school,
fat white girl!

47:13.917 --> 47:16.291
Flash forward to today,
who's got a gay friend?

47:16.291 --> 47:17.917
Everybody loves the gays!

47:17.917 --> 47:21.500
Well, thank you,
fat white girls!

47:22.583 --> 47:23.875
Fat white girls,
great work!

47:23.875 --> 47:25.375
But, you have a new mission,

47:25.375 --> 47:28.500
and it starts this evening,
effective immediately--

47:28.500 --> 47:30.792
start fucking Asian guys.

47:43.500 --> 47:44.542
Turn around
so they can see.

47:44.542 --> 47:47.250
Yep, come on.

47:47.250 --> 47:48.542
(laughter and applause)

47:48.542 --> 47:51.917
That's an Asian.

47:52.834 --> 47:54.125
If I told everybody
in this room,

47:54.125 --> 47:55.917
"Shut your eyes
and imagine an Asian,"

47:55.917 --> 47:57.041
that is literally what
you would picture, right there.

47:59.917 --> 48:02.041
Now, after the show, you get
yourself to a Lane Bryant.

48:03.625 --> 48:06.250
Or a Torrid.

48:07.333 --> 48:09.959
Beat it.

48:11.875 --> 48:15.542
All right, let's...
(chuckling)

48:15.542 --> 48:18.667
Let's...
let's switch gears here

48:18.667 --> 48:20.708
and change the subject.

48:20.708 --> 48:22.375
And I will say,
the last lesson for last.

48:22.375 --> 48:23.917
Um...
(sighing)

48:23.917 --> 48:27.917
let me tell you something:
at my age, eating McDonald's

48:27.917 --> 48:30.250
is a much different experience
than when I was younger.

48:30.250 --> 48:31.208
By the way, any time
I bring up McDonald's,

48:31.208 --> 48:33.208
people are like,
"Oh, McDonald's is gross.

48:33.208 --> 48:35.667
McDonald's is disgusting."
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

48:35.667 --> 48:39.291
You go to hell.
McDonald's is America, okay?

48:39.291 --> 48:40.708
McDonald's is my childhood.

48:40.708 --> 48:42.250
I am Pavlov's dog to McDonald's.
People are like,

48:42.250 --> 48:45.083
"It's-- You know,
the nuggets, it's pink slime."

48:45.083 --> 48:47.708
Well, you know, I'll dip it
in barbecue sauce next.

48:48.917 --> 48:51.166
McDonald's, you've got
a long way to go

48:51.166 --> 48:53.875
to disgust me
before I stop comin' to you.

48:53.875 --> 48:56.708
McDonald's could be like,
"And now, we deep fry cat shit!"

48:56.708 --> 48:59.834
Put it in a box, give me a toy,
we've got a deal!

49:01.625 --> 49:03.917
I love McDonald's.

49:03.917 --> 49:06.083
And McDonald's,
at my age,

49:06.083 --> 49:08.917
is the closest I'll come
to cheating on my wife.

49:09.917 --> 49:11.583
It is the same three
emotions:

49:11.583 --> 49:15.583
desire, pleasure, guilt.

49:16.667 --> 49:18.125
All...
within 12 minutes.

49:21.417 --> 49:22.458
I'll be driving,

49:22.458 --> 49:23.041
minding my own business,
right?

49:23.041 --> 49:23.750
I see those arches.

49:23.750 --> 49:29.041

50:55.041 --> 50:57.041

you motherfucker?"

51:05.708 --> 51:07.834

This is the actual conversation
I had with her, okay?

a joke by you,

51:16.834 --> 51:17.667
and see if
you're okay with it."

51:17.667 --> 51:19.375
She goes,
"Okay, tell me the joke."

51:19.375 --> 51:20.875

"What do you think?"

51:20.875 --> 51:23.208

"Tell the goddamn joke, Steve."

51:37.583 --> 51:41.875

"There's such bad acting
in porn."

53:58.750 --> 54:01.834
Yeah. It's porn!

54:01.834 --> 54:03.166
But it's always women

54:03.166 --> 54:04.208
that are the bad actors
in porn, always girls.

54:30.417 --> 54:32.417
Let me tell you this
right now.

54:32.417 --> 54:35.375
Anything you hear
from a man in a porn,

54:35.375 --> 54:37.375
he's being extremely honest.

54:37.375 --> 54:39.375
"Oh, my God,
this feels so good."

54:39.375 --> 54:43.166

pretty good.

54:44.083 --> 54:45.458
"Oh, I want to put it
in your asshole."

54:45.458 --> 54:47.250
Knock, knock.
"Who's there?"

54:47.250 --> 54:50.959
He's about to put it
in your asshole, that guy.

54:50.959 --> 54:52.083
"I'm gonna fuckin' come!"

54:52.083 --> 54:53.375
Get ready, he's coming.

54:55.166 --> 54:56.458
He ain't bluffing.

54:56.458 --> 54:58.125

"I'm gonna come,

54:58.125 --> 55:00.542
"I'm gonna come, I'm gonna...

55:00.542 --> 55:01.500
Oh, false alarm.
Sorry, guys."

55:10.375 --> 55:12.333
Men always tell the truth
in porn.

55:12.333 --> 55:12.792
"Tell me your PIN number."

55:12.792 --> 55:16.041
"4-5-8-6."

55:17.583 --> 55:19.291
Men don't lie in porn.
That's why, I assure you,

55:19.291 --> 55:22.125
you never heard a man
say this a porn:

55:22.125 --> 55:23.708
"I love you."

55:23.708 --> 55:25.667

- Aww.

55:25.667 --> 55:29.250

"Aww.

55:31.959 --> 55:36.125
"Aww, that poor girl.

55:36.125 --> 55:38.667

55:38.667 --> 55:39.625

55:39.625 --> 55:42.291
"Aww, that girl that just
treated her body

56:07.834 --> 56:09.458

56:59.500 --> 57:01.750
with a bunch
of her girlfriends,

57:01.750 --> 57:02.625

57:02.625 --> 57:03.625
or a video of me on a loop
just...

57:18.417 --> 57:19.917

will be like,

57:19.917 --> 57:21.625

Is that your dad?"
