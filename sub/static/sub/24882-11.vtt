00:18.266 --> 00:20.867
Oh. Ha ha ha!
¡Hola!

00:20.867 --> 00:23.800
Guess what.
I'm playing pretend.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.066
Can you guess
what kind of animal

00:26.066 --> 00:28.500
I am pretending to be?

00:28.500 --> 00:30.734
Hmm? I'll give you a hint.

00:30.734 --> 00:32.767
Meow! Meow!

00:36.066 --> 00:39.767
Oh! Right. I'm a gato.
I'm a kitty cat.

00:39.767 --> 00:43.433

01:15.200 --> 01:16.734
Chris:
Heh heh heh.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.133
Oh! Hey. Hey.
Welcome to Sesame Street.

01:23.133 --> 01:25.033
We are so glad you're here.

01:25.033 --> 01:28.233
Hmm. Ah-choo! Hmm.
Excuse me.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.266
- Ah-choo!
- Oh. Oh, hi, Chris.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.967
Is Chris feeling okay?

01:33.967 --> 01:37.133
Yeah, Elmo. I'm feeling fine.
Oh. Ah-choo!

01:37.133 --> 01:39.400
- Oh, oh, oh!

01:39.400 --> 01:42.633
- Oh, ho ho ho!
- Oh. That's why.

01:42.633 --> 01:45.033
- Oh. Ah-choo!
- Oh, ho!

01:45.033 --> 01:47.367
- Oh, there's a cat.
- Oh, but, Chris.

01:47.367 --> 01:50.567
- Why do kitty cats
make you sneeze?

01:50.567 --> 01:53.100
Uh, because I'm a little bit
allergic to cats, Elmo.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.867
Elmo's not allergic.
Oh, so Elmo is going
to pet the kitty cat.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.734
- Here, kitty!
- Hold on, hold on, Elmo.

01:58.734 --> 02:01.166
- Cats can get scared easily,

02:01.166 --> 02:03.533
so, uh, instead
of running towards her,

02:03.533 --> 02:08.033
try putting out your hand
to see if she comes to you.

02:08.033 --> 02:11.000
- Gotcha. Ha ha ha!
- Okay.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.700
Hi there, kitty cat.
Hi there.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.367
Oh. Elmo wants to be
your friend.

02:16.367 --> 02:17.400
Yeah-eah!

02:19.033 --> 02:22.033
Aw. Elmo loves you,
too, kitty cat.

02:22.033 --> 02:24.200
Oh. Elmo's gonna keep
this kitty as a pet!

02:24.200 --> 02:25.500
- Hold on, Elmo.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.600
Um, you can't just keep
an animal

02:27.600 --> 02:29.500
just because you find it.

02:29.500 --> 02:32.000
Now, I don't see a collar,
but that kitty cat

02:32.000 --> 02:35.033
could have an owner
and could be lost. Mm-hmm.

02:35.033 --> 02:38.233
Boy-- Elmo will help
the kitty cat find her home.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.367
Hey, hey, hey!
And I'll help!

02:40.367 --> 02:42.633
Yibba yibba
yibba yibba!

02:42.633 --> 02:44.400
Until we find the owner,
the kitten

02:44.400 --> 02:46.467
will be safe with us
at the community center.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.467
Did somebody say
"kitten"?

02:48.467 --> 02:50.233
Yes. I did.

02:50.233 --> 02:52.533
Did somebody say
"cookie"?

02:52.533 --> 02:54.667
No.
Nobody said that.

02:54.667 --> 02:56.400
Oh, well.
Never hurt to ask.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.900
Yeah. You tried.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.400
We're gonna use
these supplies

02:59.400 --> 03:00.900
to help us find
the kitten's owner.

03:00.900 --> 03:04.200
Ahh. Excellent idea,
Christopher.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.433
Ahh. Ahem.

03:06.433 --> 03:08.900
Anybody lose a kitten?!

03:08.900 --> 03:10.633
It's adorable.
If you lost it,

03:10.633 --> 03:12.300
you're probably gonna
want it!

03:12.300 --> 03:15.500
No, no.
Grover, no! No, no!

03:15.500 --> 03:18.767
I meant we'd make signs
to tell people

03:18.767 --> 03:20.500
we found a kitten.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.800
Ah. Ah. I suppose
that could work, too.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.166
Yeah.
Good idea.

03:24.166 --> 03:26.934
And Elmo will draw
pictures of the kitty cat

03:26.934 --> 03:28.700
so the owner knows
it's her.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.533
Oh. Sorry.

03:30.533 --> 03:33.867
Hey, hey, hey!
Nice job on the signs, guys.

03:33.867 --> 03:35.200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.233
Ooh. Ah-ah-choo!

03:37.233 --> 03:40.200
- Oh. They look great.
- Yeah-eah-eah!

03:40.200 --> 03:42.433
Oh. Elmo will put
them up right now

03:42.433 --> 03:45.400
so we can find
the kitty cat's owner.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.667
Oh. Bye-bye for now,
kitty cat. Ha ha ha!

03:48.834 --> 03:50.600
Hey, and I'll meet you
out there just as soon

03:50.600 --> 03:52.767
as I give the kitty cat
something to eat and drink.

03:52.767 --> 03:56.633
- Elmo: Okay!
- Me know what kitty want
to eat and drink.

03:56.633 --> 03:59.233
Cookie and milk.

03:59.233 --> 04:00.900
No, no, no, no,
Cookie Monster.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.233
Cats can't have cookies
or drink milk.

04:03.233 --> 04:04.700
It's bad for them.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.867
Then me glad me
not a kitty cat.

04:06.867 --> 04:10.300
Ahh, ohh, ohh. Ohh.
Nom nom nom.

04:10.300 --> 04:14.133
Okay. Um, cats need
to drink water,

04:14.133 --> 04:16.333
and I have some cat food
over at the store.

04:16.333 --> 04:19.200
Oh. Go, go.
I, cute and furry Grover,

04:19.200 --> 04:20.800
will take care
of the cute and furry

04:20.800 --> 04:22.567
domesticated house pet
until you get back.

04:25.266 --> 04:28.233
Uh, are you sure
you're okay?

04:28.233 --> 04:30.867
Oh, please.
Christopher.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.400
I'm an expert on zebras.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.533
- Kitties.
- Kitties.

04:33.533 --> 04:35.834
Hey, Chris.
No worry about a thing.

04:35.834 --> 04:37.433
Me help, too.

04:37.433 --> 04:39.467
- Um, okay.

04:39.467 --> 04:43.600
Well, I'm gonna go
get some food from
the store, all right?

04:43.600 --> 04:45.734
Terrific. Okay, Chris,
take your time, buddy.

04:45.734 --> 04:47.633
Yeah. We have this
totally under control.

04:47.633 --> 04:49.867
- We got this.
- Oh, dear.

04:49.867 --> 04:52.667
The kitty seems sad.
Do not worry, kitty cat.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.000
Chris and Elmo
will be back.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.667
When I feel sad,
I like hugs.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.433
The kitty probably
wants a hug.

04:58.433 --> 05:01.767
Here, kitty kitty!

05:01.767 --> 05:04.767
- Oh, look at you.
- Yeah, you, you.

05:04.767 --> 05:06.734
Grover:
You're so cute
and adorable.

05:06.734 --> 05:08.867
- Yeah. Meow.
- Oh, look at you, kitty.

05:08.867 --> 05:12.433
Hmm. If I were a lost
little kitten,

05:12.433 --> 05:14.934
which flavor would
I like the best?

05:14.934 --> 05:16.533
Yeah. Heh heh heh.

05:18.133 --> 05:21.100
Ohh! Uh-oh!
That cannot be good.

05:22.433 --> 05:25.266
Oh, come on!
What happened?

05:25.266 --> 05:27.200
I was gone
for two seconds.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.667
Turns out kitty
does not want a hug.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.266
No, no.
Of course not.

05:35.266 --> 05:37.367
Most cats don't like
to be grabbed or hugged.

05:37.367 --> 05:39.266
But I like hugs.

05:39.266 --> 05:40.533
It's true.
He loves them.

05:40.533 --> 05:42.266
Yes, but you're not a cat.

05:42.266 --> 05:44.500
Oh. Well, I wouldn't
go as far as to say--
that is true.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.734
I am not a cat. No.

05:45.734 --> 05:47.300
So instead of trying
to grab her,

05:47.300 --> 05:52.533
why don't we stop
and think about how
the kitten must be feeling?

05:52.533 --> 05:55.233
Grover:
Hmm. She looks like
she might be feeling

05:55.233 --> 05:57.633
a little nervous
for some reason.

05:58.767 --> 05:59.800
Chris:
She sure does.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.433
Oh. Wait a minute.

06:01.433 --> 06:04.400
If little kitty not happy,
then why she wagging

06:04.400 --> 06:06.700
her little tail
like a little doggie?

06:08.767 --> 06:11.900
Uh, because cats are different
than dogs, Cookie Monster.

06:11.900 --> 06:12.900
Hmm?

06:12.900 --> 06:14.567
When a dog is wagging
its tail,

06:14.567 --> 06:15.734
it's because it's happy,

06:15.734 --> 06:18.033
but when a cat
is moving its tail,

06:18.033 --> 06:19.900
it's because it's upset.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.900
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.467
Yeah.
That really confusing, Chris.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.467
A little bit.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.066
Psst, psst.
Kss, kss.

06:26.066 --> 06:27.900
- Here, kitty.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.467
Here, kitty.
Come on, kitty.

06:35.367 --> 06:39.667
Heh heh. Ooh.
Ah-choo! Mmm. Ugh.

06:39.667 --> 06:43.433
Cats like gentle touching,
not big hugs,

06:43.433 --> 06:45.767
so instead of running
at the kitty,

06:45.767 --> 06:47.367
try holding out your hand

06:47.367 --> 06:49.166
and letting it
come to you.

06:49.166 --> 06:52.266
Oh. Uh, okay.

06:52.266 --> 06:54.200
- Mm-hmm.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.233
Hello,
little kitty.

06:55.233 --> 06:56.600
Hello, kitty.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.166
Yeah, yeah?

06:59.567 --> 07:03.400
Aww. Ohh. Who's a cute
little kitty cat?

07:03.400 --> 07:05.867
- So sweet.

07:05.867 --> 07:08.266
There you go.
Now you got it!

07:08.266 --> 07:09.867
Hey. I tell you what.
I'm gonna go see

07:09.867 --> 07:11.533
how Elmo's doing
with those signs,

07:11.533 --> 07:12.934
and, uh, actually,
you know what?

07:12.934 --> 07:15.133
I better get a litter box
for kitty, too.

07:15.133 --> 07:16.500
Oh, no need,
Christopher.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.800
I, Grover, will get
a litter box for little kitty.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.633
Ha ha ha! Okay.
Thanks.

07:21.633 --> 07:25.500
Hey. Uh, go, team--
ooh-- ah-choo!

07:25.500 --> 07:27.133
Kitty care.

07:27.133 --> 07:29.467
Ah. Go, team.
Bye-bye, kitty.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.433
Oh, boy. Oh, ho ho!
Oh, oh! Hi, Chris!

07:36.433 --> 07:38.433
Ha ha ha!
Hey, buddy.

07:38.433 --> 07:40.233
Uh, how's it going?

07:40.233 --> 07:42.533
Well-- ha ha hee hee--
Elmo didn't want the signs

07:42.533 --> 07:44.834
to, you know, blow away,

07:44.834 --> 07:47.133
so Elmo used too much tape.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.400
Ha ha ha!

07:48.400 --> 07:49.633
Well, here.
Let me help you
with that, buddy.

07:49.633 --> 07:50.667
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.633
Anybody got any litter?

07:52.633 --> 07:55.066
Oh. Excuse me, guys.
You have any litter over here?

07:57.033 --> 07:59.233
I am taking care
of the kitty.

07:59.233 --> 08:02.266
And how is collecting garbage
taking care of the cat?

08:02.266 --> 08:04.800
It was your idea, silly.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.700
You said that kitty
needs a litter box.

08:06.700 --> 08:07.834
Here it is.

08:07.834 --> 08:11.233
Grover, a litter box
isn't a box of garbage.

08:11.233 --> 08:13.834
It's a plastic bin
filled with a special sand

08:13.834 --> 08:15.100
called litter.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.166
Cats use them
to go potty.

08:17.166 --> 08:19.700
A kitty potty?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.467
Let's just get
a litter box

08:21.467 --> 08:22.667
from the store, okay?

08:22.667 --> 08:25.433
- Okay. Okay.
- Uh, Elmo.

08:25.433 --> 08:26.834
You gonna be okay?

08:26.834 --> 08:27.867
Oh, yeah.
Elmo's got it under control.

08:27.867 --> 08:29.266
- Okay.
- No problem.

08:29.266 --> 08:31.500
Elmo's got this.
Ohh! Oh, no.

08:31.500 --> 08:36.500
- Oh, no. Oh, no! Chris!

08:36.500 --> 08:38.233
Oh. Hey, Cookie.

08:38.233 --> 08:39.700
Me so glad
you here.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.400
Me so scared.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.533
Uh, what's wrong,
Cookie Monster?

08:44.533 --> 08:47.133
The kitty,
it's growling at me,

08:47.133 --> 08:50.333
but she sitting on me lap,
so me no can move.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.633
Nice kitty.
Nice kitty.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.767
Ha ha ha! Cookie Monster,
she's not growling.

08:56.767 --> 08:58.000
She's purring.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.800
Oh, purring.
Of cou--

08:59.800 --> 09:01.233
Wait. What purring?

09:01.233 --> 09:02.834
It's a sound
that cats make

09:02.834 --> 09:05.400
when they're feeling
happy and safe.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.500
Oh. Well,
you know what?

09:06.500 --> 09:10.166
If kitty happy,
then me happy, too.

09:10.166 --> 09:13.367
- Litter box is in the house.

09:13.367 --> 09:15.233
Hey, Grover.
What that?

09:15.233 --> 09:17.433
Me thought you getting
a box of garbage.

09:17.433 --> 09:20.500
No. A litter box
is a kitty potty.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.166
Why would a kitty want
a box of trash?

09:22.166 --> 09:24.433
That is ridiculous. Ha!

09:24.433 --> 09:28.500
Ha ha ha!
Well, I think this kitty
has everything she needs--

09:28.500 --> 09:30.567
cat food, water,
litter box,

09:30.567 --> 09:31.900
and a safe place to be.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.100
Now we just have to find--

09:34.100 --> 09:35.433
Hey, everybody!
Everybody!

09:35.433 --> 09:38.633
Oh, oh, oh!
Elmo found a doggie!

09:38.633 --> 09:40.600
What?!
No, no, Elmo, no.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.567
We're not trying to find
more animals.

09:42.567 --> 09:45.600
We're still trying to find
the owner for this one.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.700
Arf! I'm
the kitten's owner.

09:49.700 --> 09:52.834
Oh. I've been looking
everywhere for her.

09:52.834 --> 09:54.266
I'm so grateful
you found her.

09:54.266 --> 09:56.800
She slipped out of her collar
and got outside.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.300
Little Barbara.
Oh! Arf.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.767
Oh, we took

12:42.200 --> 12:44.300
Ah. Let me see. Okay.

12:44.300 --> 12:47.533
We need a can of tuna fish,

12:47.533 --> 12:50.000

12:50.000 --> 12:51.533
Okay.

12:51.533 --> 12:54.700
- No, no, no.
- Okay. We got
a can of tuna fish,

12:54.700 --> 12:56.400
uh, we got bread.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.800
Oh, we got delicious tomato,
and we got lettuce.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.400
Okay. Order up!

13:03.400 --> 13:05.633
No, no. Ugh!
Cookie, no, look.

13:05.633 --> 13:07.500
We need the avocado.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.734
Cookie Monster:
Oh, oh. Avocado.

13:09.734 --> 13:11.567
Okay.
Let's see. Avocado.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.734
Uh, avocado.

13:13.734 --> 13:14.834
Not under there.

13:14.834 --> 13:16.400
Avocado. 'Scuse me.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.834
- Wait. Hey!
- Avocado.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.567
- Avocado.

13:19.567 --> 13:21.266
What's avocado?

13:21.266 --> 13:22.900
Look, Cookie Monster.
Don't worry.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.233
We got to find a farm.

13:24.233 --> 13:25.600
Oh, a farm!

13:25.600 --> 13:27.633
You mean like a chicken
or goat farm?

13:27.633 --> 13:30.633
Ay, ay, ay.
No. The avocado farm!

13:30.633 --> 13:31.734
Come on!

13:31.734 --> 13:33.834
Oh, okay.
Oh, boy.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.367
Both:
To the avocado farm!

13:47.533 --> 13:49.467
Cookie Monster:
We're going to the avocado farm.

13:52.300 --> 13:53.667
Gonger:
Here we are!

13:53.667 --> 13:55.800
Cookie Monster:
Oh, wow. All these
avocado trees?

13:55.800 --> 13:57.133
Gonger:
That's right.

13:57.133 --> 13:59.400
Cookie Monster: Hello there,
Mr. Avocado Farmer guy.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.533
Hi, Cookie Monster,
Gonger.

14:01.533 --> 14:02.867
Cookie Monster: Oh, yeah.
Can you help us, please?

14:02.867 --> 14:04.600
We need an avocado.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.066
Well, you've come
to the right place.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.133
Farmer:
Avocados are a healthy fruit

14:10.133 --> 14:12.567
that grow on many different
kinds of trees.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.467
Some trees give big,
green avocados

14:16.467 --> 14:17.867
with very smooth skin.

14:20.934 --> 14:24.500
Other trees have avocados
that are smaller and darker,

14:24.500 --> 14:26.967
and the skin is bumpy
and crinkly.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.767
See the difference?

14:30.533 --> 14:33.033
Cookie Monster:
Boy, avocado trees
sure are tall.

14:33.033 --> 14:34.900
Farmer:
They sure are.

14:34.900 --> 14:38.867
Some avocados get picked
by hand, using ladders,

14:38.867 --> 14:42.433
but some are so high up that
we have to use special poles.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.467
The inside looks like this.

14:47.467 --> 14:49.367
It has a giant seed.

14:49.367 --> 14:51.734
You can mash up avocado
to make guacamole.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.867
Here are a couple
of avocados for you

14:54.867 --> 14:56.533
to take with you.

14:56.533 --> 14:58.533
Gonger:
Thank you,
Mr. Avocado Farmer.

14:58.533 --> 15:01.166
Cookie Monster:
Yeah. You really helpful.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.400
Cookie Monster:
We got avocados!

15:05.400 --> 15:07.800

the sandwich,

15:10.433 --> 15:13.500

20:09.934 --> 20:12.266
How do you pretend
to be a cat?

20:12.266 --> 20:14.367
Oh, good question,
Dorothy.

20:14.367 --> 20:16.600
Oh. Dorothy, Dorothy,
let's ask Mr. Noodle.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.767
Mr. Noodle!

20:18.767 --> 20:21.166
How do you pretend
to be a cat, Mr. Noodle?

20:23.333 --> 20:24.767
Kid:
Wait. What's that?

20:24.767 --> 20:26.233
Kid #2:
That's not a cat.

20:26.233 --> 20:27.367
Elmo:
That's a duck.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.500
Kid:
That's a duck, Mr. Noodle.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.000
- Kid: Look at that!
- Kid #2: It's an egg!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.700
Kid #3:
Cats don't lay eggs.

20:35.700 --> 20:36.934
Whoops!

20:39.066 --> 20:41.100
Elmo:
Mr. Noodle. Hee hee hee!

20:42.967 --> 20:45.500
Kid:
Okay. Now he's got it.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.734
Elmo:
Ha ha ha!

20:46.734 --> 20:49.367
Kid:
No. He's doing the monkey.

20:49.367 --> 20:50.934
Elmo:
Yeah. That's a monkey.

20:50.934 --> 20:52.700
Kid:
Come on, Mr. Noodle.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.300
Kid #2:
Be a kitty cat.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.834
Elmo:
You know, a cat.

20:55.834 --> 20:57.367
Cats say "meow!"

20:58.767 --> 21:01.600
- Kid: That's it!
- Kid #2: That's a cat!

21:01.600 --> 21:02.934
Kid:
What's that?

21:02.934 --> 21:05.567
Kid #2:
It's a dog!

21:05.567 --> 21:06.767
Kids:
It's Barkley!

21:08.433 --> 21:09.867
Kid:
Uh-oh!

21:09.867 --> 21:11.667
- Kid #2: Mr. Noodle!
- Kid: Look behind you.

21:12.767 --> 21:15.166
Mr. Noodle, run!
Run, run!

21:16.834 --> 21:19.767
Kid #2:
He's chasing him!
Mr. Noodle's a good cat.

21:19.767 --> 21:22.667
He fooled Barkley.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.700
Elmo wants to know
more about cats.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.767
Don't you? How can
we find out more?

21:29.066 --> 21:30.767
Who could that be?

21:30.767 --> 21:32.700
Hmm.

21:32.700 --> 21:35.133
Oh. Ha ha ha!

21:35.133 --> 21:37.300
How'd you like
to talk to some cats,

21:37.300 --> 21:40.500
a big jungle cat...

21:40.500 --> 21:43.100
- Whoa.
- And a little domestic cat.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.900
- Meow.
- Oh, yeah,

21:44.900 --> 21:47.367
but-- but how can
you both be cats?

21:47.367 --> 21:50.266
You both look
completely different.

21:50.266 --> 21:53.367
Let's show him our mutual
"catness," brother.

21:53.367 --> 21:56.333
Two cats with whiskers.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.734
Meow meow.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.767
- Oh, beautiful.
- Mew mew mew.

21:59.767 --> 22:03.333
Paws with pads
underneath... and claws!

22:03.333 --> 22:05.233
Mrraww!

22:05.233 --> 22:08.633
And-- oh, dig this--
tails.

22:08.633 --> 22:10.166
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

22:10.166 --> 22:11.967
And two big,
big cat eyes,

22:11.967 --> 22:14.834
two cat ears,
and a cat nose and mouth

22:14.834 --> 22:16.934
we are so proud of, man.

22:16.934 --> 22:18.400
Mew mew mew.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.300
And sometimes we purr.

22:21.567 --> 22:24.400
- Oh. Ha ha ha! Aw.
- And sometimes we yell.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.867
- Rawrrr!
- Meowww!

22:25.867 --> 22:27.266
- Ha ha hee hee!
- Ha ha ha!

22:27.266 --> 22:28.834
Oh! Mr. Tiger is right.

22:28.834 --> 22:31.633
You are both cats
except you roar,

22:31.633 --> 22:34.000
- and you meow.
- Meow.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.600
Well, that's because
I am king of the jungle,

22:37.600 --> 22:41.200
and, uh, he's, well,
king of his apartment.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.367
Wow!
The king of the jungle?

22:43.367 --> 22:45.300
Ah, that's nothing.

22:45.300 --> 22:48.000
The lion is king
of all animals,

22:48.000 --> 22:49.734
and here's a story
to prove it--

22:49.734 --> 22:52.633
- "The Lion and the Mouse."
- Oh, look, look, look.

22:52.633 --> 22:55.967
Dorothy's imagining
Elmo as a lion.

22:55.967 --> 22:59.633
Tiger:
One day, a lion got
a thorn stuck in his paw,

22:59.633 --> 23:01.233
and it hurt!

23:01.233 --> 23:02.867
You're not lying.

23:02.867 --> 23:05.600
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.934
Oh, maybe Elmo Mouse
can pull the thorn out
of Mr. Lion's paw.

23:09.934 --> 23:12.300
Yes, try it, please.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.667
Okay.

23:13.667 --> 23:14.867
Ohh.

23:24.033 --> 23:25.033
Ohh!

23:25.033 --> 23:27.533
Rawwrr!

23:27.533 --> 23:29.567
Oh. Thank you, mouse.

23:29.567 --> 23:31.166
You're welcome!

23:31.166 --> 23:33.800
Maybe Elmo Lion
can help you someday.

23:35.467 --> 23:36.800
Oh!

23:39.500 --> 23:43.600
Tiger:
A year later,
the lion was very hungry,

23:43.600 --> 23:46.033
hungry as a lion.
Ha ha ha!

23:46.033 --> 23:49.200
Hey.
Where's the beef?

23:49.200 --> 23:53.033
Ahh. Here comes lunch.
Rawwrr!

23:53.033 --> 23:55.734
Oh, no, no, please,
Mr. Lion.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.767
Please do not eat
Elmo Mouse.

23:57.767 --> 23:59.834
Hey. Wait a minute.

23:59.834 --> 24:03.400
That's the mouse
that helped Elmo Lion.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.467
Hey.
Have a piece of bread.

24:05.467 --> 24:08.633
Huh? Oh.

24:08.633 --> 24:10.333
Both:
Nom nom nom.

24:11.767 --> 24:14.500
And that's the king
of the animals for you.

24:14.500 --> 24:17.200
Oh, wow. Elmo loved
that story,

24:17.200 --> 24:20.467
but now Dorothy wants
to sing "The Cat Song."

24:20.467 --> 24:21.934
Oh, it's my favorite!

24:21.934 --> 24:24.300
Mmm. Mine, too.

24:24.300 --> 24:25.667
Then sing with Elmo.
