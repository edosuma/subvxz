Whoa, whoa!

Oh!

01:38.181 --> 01:40.217
Ma, Mr. gunderson's coming!

01:40.309 --> 01:42.174
He must have a letter, I bet!

01:42.269 --> 01:43.475
It's from your father.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.016
I can feel it, it must be.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.563
He's coming home.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.816
Mrs. eriksson, children,

01:59.953 --> 02:00.953
you got a letter here.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.827
Oh god,
please let it be from Earl.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.077
It has to be.

02:07.169 --> 02:10.752
He's just got to come home,
he has to.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.579
I can't live like this anymore.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.843
Dear Mrs. eriksson.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.674
This is hortense greely

02:24.770 --> 02:26.510
writing from greely's outpost,

02:26.605 --> 02:29.768
40 miles outside fort Collins,
Colorado.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.184
It's not from your father.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.278
Oh.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.133
You
wrote to sheriff Jackson there

02:37.157 --> 02:40.365
asking about your husband,
lucky eriksson.

02:40.452 --> 02:43.740
We seen him last before he set
out for his gold mine.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.037
But that was nearly
three months ago

02:46.124 --> 02:48.115
Ana we ain't seen him since.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.826
That mine of his is
located right in the middle

02:50.921 --> 02:53.207
of hostile Indian territory,

02:53.298 --> 02:55.630
just where the Cheyenne
and the Pawnee Indians

02:55.717 --> 02:57.378
are fighting a war.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.881
Well mind you,
I ain't saying for sure

02:59.971 --> 03:02.087
that anything's happened
to him, Mrs. eriksson,

03:02.182 --> 03:03.922
but it don't look good to me.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.058
I'm real sorry.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.887
Yours truly, hortense greely.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.517
Greely's trading post.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.517
They said that

03:16.863 --> 03:18.353
they haven't seen
him for three months

03:18.448 --> 03:19.448
and that he's missing.

03:20.409 --> 03:21.489
And he might be dead.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.860
He's not dead.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.411
Not lucky.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.329
They don't call him
that for no reason.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.075
I'll have to go and get him.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.534
Now how are you
going to do that?

03:32.629 --> 03:33.994
I don't know, Mr. gunderson,

03:34.089 --> 03:35.545
I'll have to go there,
I suppose.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.793
With those wild Indians, ma?

03:37.884 --> 03:40.375
Wow, Indian ma, honest?

03:40.470 --> 03:43.086
For goodness sake, Mrs.
Eriksson, you can't do that.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.012
You=- you're a woman.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.342
Oh, I can't now, can I, Mr.
Gunderson? You just watch me.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.895
It is time that Earl
come home and stay home.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.975
He made a promise to me
and it's time that he keep it.

03:57.320 --> 04:01.029
I am a patient woman,
Mr. gunderson.

04:01.116 --> 04:04.153
But my Patience has run out.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.532
But going into hostile
Indian territory all alone?

04:08.415 --> 04:09.871
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am,

04:09.958 --> 04:11.914
that's just plain old crazy.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.618
Besides, who'll take
care of your young 'uns?

04:14.713 --> 04:17.750
My dear friend hella bergdahl
will look after the children

04:17.841 --> 04:22.005
if indeed that is of your
concern, Mr. gunderson.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.426
You'll excuse me, Mrs. eriksson.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.504
I certainly don't
mean to intrude.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.386
But you know,
it's over 400 miles

04:28.477 --> 04:29.808
to fort Collins, Colorado.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.351
That far, is it?

04:31.438 --> 04:32.518
Yes, ma'am.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.937
Then I best get started.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.980
You'll just have to excuse me

04:36.067 --> 04:37.773
one more time, Mrs. eriksson.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.647
But even if you do
find your husband,

04:39.738 --> 04:41.649
do you think you're
honestly going to get

04:41.740 --> 04:43.651
Earl “lucky” eriksson
to settle down

04:43.742 --> 04:45.073
and tend a farm?

04:45.160 --> 04:47.025
He married me, didn't he?

04:47.120 --> 04:50.362
He has two children
and a farm, doesn't he?

04:50.457 --> 04:52.243
Why would he do that
if he didn't intend

04:52.375 --> 04:54.240
to come home and stay?

[Somber musicl

04:57.380 --> 04:58.495
I don't know, ma'am.

Mr. gunderson,
I pray day and night

05:01.718 --> 05:03.800
that my husband come home.

05:03.887 --> 05:07.220
And now god wants me to
go and bring him home.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.387
And then he'll stay.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.925
What can I do for a young lady?

35:40.013 --> 35:41.628
Young lady?

35:41.723 --> 35:43.338
I'll have you know
that I am nearly

35:43.433 --> 35:45.424
40 years of age.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.725
- You're kidding.
- Certainly not.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.354
You look good for your age.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.851
Thank you very much.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.024
My pleasure.

36:01.076 --> 36:04.159
Now, Mr. Cole,
my name is Alice eriksson.

36:05.372 --> 36:08.079
And I need you to
help me find my husband.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.281
Husband?

36:11.503 --> 36:12.743
Goddammit, figures.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.247
What figures?

36:15.507 --> 36:16.507
Nothing.

36:17.425 --> 36:18.835
Go on with your story.

36:28.395 --> 36:30.477
- Why me?
- 'Cause everybody I ask

36:30.563 --> 36:32.770
said that you're the best
man for the job.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.222
Yep, I am.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.944
I get a hundred bucks a man.
You got a hundred bucks?

36:40.031 --> 36:41.521
I do, Mr. Cole.

36:42.409 --> 36:43.409
Just.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.654
All right, I'll find him.

36:45.745 --> 36:46.825
Where is he?

36:50.625 --> 36:51.660
Here.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.377
All right, I'll go find him.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.423
We. I'm coming
with you, Mr. Cole.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.718
You can come along as
far as greely's outpost

37:03.805 --> 37:05.921
but I ain't taking you
into Indian territory,

37:06.015 --> 37:07.926
I can tell you that much.

37:08.017 --> 37:10.133
You're damn lucky
I'll go in there.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.595
Well, let's just see about
that when we get there.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.351
- Shall we go?
- All right.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.812
Oh, sheriff Jackson,

37:17.902 --> 37:20.644
is it all right
if Mr. Cole leaves now?

37:20.739 --> 37:22.604
Get him the fuck out of here!

37:22.699 --> 37:24.064
Excuse my French, ma'am.

37:24.159 --> 37:26.821
That is not French, sir.

37:27.704 --> 37:31.037
- Apparently, Mr. Cole, you can leave now.
- Let's get.

37:48.641 --> 37:49.926
- Morning, folks.
- Morning.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.474
What can I do you for?

37:51.561 --> 37:53.426
Well, tell the man
your husband's name.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.682
My husband
is named Earl eriksson

37:55.774 --> 37:59.107
and he has a mining claim
outside greely's trading post.

37:59.194 --> 38:01.355
Yep, lucky's mine.
I'll get the Grant.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.029
You sure knew right where that was.
Well, sure.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.990
- Everybody knows lucky.
- Have you seen him lately?

38:15.084 --> 38:16.790
Can't say that I have.

38:16.878 --> 38:18.914
Used to be he'd come into
town about once a month

38:19.005 --> 38:20.711
and raise holy hell
for a few days

38:20.799 --> 38:22.835
until the sheriff threw
him in the pokey.

38:22.926 --> 38:26.384
Then he'd go back to his mine, but
he ain't been around for a while.

38:26.471 --> 38:29.383
- How long?
- About three months, I'd say.

38:29.474 --> 38:33.092
That's what Mrs. greely's
letter said, three months.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.186
Here it is.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.431
That'll be 50 cents please.

38:38.942 --> 38:40.022
Well, pay the man.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.160
- Much obliged, ma'am.
- My pleasure, sir.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.658
Okay, let's get out of here.

38:57.126 --> 39:01.335
Lucky eriksson's wife, huh.

39:02.382 --> 39:04.088
Let's just hope
she don't find him.

39:06.469 --> 39:09.256
[Ominous musicl

39:19.691 --> 39:21.147
What happened?

39:21.234 --> 39:24.317
Indians.
There were thousands of them.

39:24.404 --> 39:27.191
It was a damn butchery. I ain't
never seen anything like it.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.024
I was the only one
to make it out.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.450
Where did it happen?

39:32.537 --> 39:34.653
Out past greely's outpost.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.113
Those Indians are having a war.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.209
Don't you get cold, Mr. Cole?

39:53.975 --> 39:57.888
- Not really.
- You're like my son, only he's six.

39:57.979 --> 40:02.473
What do you mean? - Sometimes he
goes outside naked in the winter.

40:02.567 --> 40:06.059
- It's good for you.
- Yeah, that's what I hear.

40:06.154 --> 40:08.361
People in Sweden break
holes in the ice

40:08.448 --> 40:10.029
and go swimming in the winter.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.448
Yeah, I've done it.

40:12.535 --> 40:13.615
But it ain't my favorite.

40:14.537 --> 40:17.153
So, where do you
hail from, Mr. Cole?

40:19.250 --> 40:21.582
Independence Missouri, ma'am.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.910
The plumb center of
all these here United States.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.165
How about you?

40:25.256 --> 40:27.372
Red cloud, Nebraska.

40:27.508 --> 40:30.625
- Is that near Omaha?
- No, as a matter of fact, it's not.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.553
It's about 450 miles
southwest of Omaha.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.346
Well, I've been to Omaha.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.391
Really? What did you think?

40:38.478 --> 40:40.764
Well, I met this redheaded
gal there in a saloon.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.471
She was one of the most feisty
fillies I ever done rode.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.643
Uh... is red cloud near Lincoln?

40:48.738 --> 40:52.401
No, it is not. It is 300 miles
southwest of Lincoln.

40:52.533 --> 40:55.024
- Is that near anything?
- Nope.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.405
The only town of any size
at all near red cloud

40:57.497 --> 41:00.330
is Hastings, which is
a hundred miles due north.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.579
It's really not near shit.
Not near what?

41:03.670 --> 41:05.410
Not near anything.

41:05.505 --> 41:07.666
Well, you sure know
your directions.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.293
Yes, Mr. Cole, I do.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.530
How many folks do
you got there in Hastings?

41:13.554 --> 41:16.717
I believe there are
2,500 people there.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.764
And, although a scoundrel,

41:18.851 --> 41:20.967
colonel d.T.
Hastings of the St. Joseph

41:21.062 --> 41:23.519
and grand island railroad
did a service to the town

41:23.606 --> 41:26.018
when he ran the railroad
through Adams county.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.434
That's still a hundred
miles away from red cloud.

41:29.529 --> 41:30.529
Yes.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.151
Sounds like lonesome country.

41:34.242 --> 41:35.982
It's dam-=-

41:36.077 --> 41:37.077
darn lonesome.

41:39.622 --> 41:41.158
You meant damn lonesome,
didn't you?

41:41.249 --> 41:43.865
- No, I did not.
- Yeah, you did, damn lonesome.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.450
You can't swear, can you?

41:45.586 --> 41:48.202
I certainly can,
and any time I want to.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.208
- Well, go ahead, show me.
- Okay.

41:50.299 --> 41:52.164
Uh...

41:52.260 --> 41:54.876
- Dang.
- That's it, dang?

41:54.971 --> 41:56.211
Holy moley.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.256
Are you a married man, Mr. Cole?

42:01.185 --> 42:03.517
I was. -
Did your wife pass away?

42:04.856 --> 42:06.767
Nah, she left me
for another fella.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.378
A friend of mine,
if you want to know the truth.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.188
I take it you're
not friends anymore.

42:11.279 --> 42:12.644
Nah.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.650
Not with either of 'em.

42:14.741 --> 42:16.857
But that was way back
in independence,

42:16.951 --> 42:19.033
and that was a long way away,
a long time ago.

42:22.582 --> 42:25.494
Do you ever
get lonesome, Mr. Cole?

42:25.585 --> 42:27.291
Sometimes. How about you?

42:27.378 --> 42:28.743
Sometimes.

42:30.339 --> 42:31.829
No, often.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.591
Yeah, well, actually, me too.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.378
I try and work as much as I can.

42:39.474 --> 42:40.964
Keeps my mind off of things.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.060
Me too.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.267
I work my fingers to the bone

42:45.354 --> 42:48.812
dawn to dusk everyday,
seven days a week.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.190
And it helps too.

42:51.277 --> 42:54.019
Yeah, but you don't kill
people for a living.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.899
That's right, I forgot.

42:55.990 --> 42:56.990
I never do.

42:59.660 --> 43:02.322
How long ago did this
husband of yours skedaddle?

43:02.413 --> 43:04.199
When our boy Alex was born

43:04.290 --> 43:05.746
and he is six years old.

43:05.833 --> 43:09.121
I have a girl too,
she's ten years old.

43:09.212 --> 43:12.204
Her name's Willa
after my grandma.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.084
So he don't even
know his own son?

43:15.051 --> 43:16.051
No.

43:17.345 --> 43:19.427
You, pardon my French,
ma'am, but

43:19.514 --> 43:22.301
that husband of yours is a
lowdown, no good, dirty varmint

43:22.391 --> 43:23.551
as far as I can reckon.

43:24.644 --> 43:26.851
Well, maybe lucky's
tired of running around

43:26.938 --> 43:29.930
and he is ready to settie down.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.685
Yeah, could be.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.516
Have you any kids, Mr. Cole?

43:34.862 --> 43:36.443
- No.
- Why not?

43:36.531 --> 43:38.522
Just never got around to it,
I suppose.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.356
But if I had me a boy,
I wouldn't leave him.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.533
I'd take him with me
everywhere I go.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.030
To help you kill people?

43:44.122 --> 43:45.987
Now, 100k,
I went and forgot about it,

43:46.082 --> 43:48.118
but no, I wouldn't do that.

43:48.209 --> 43:50.416
- I'd get another job.
- And what might that be?

43:50.503 --> 43:53.245
Wwhy, I'd be a singer. Hmm.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.421
Ah, you didn't know I had
a purdy singing voice?

43:55.508 --> 43:57.499
Do.

43:57.593 --> 43:58.924
Want to hear a song?

43:59.804 --> 44:00.804
Why wouldn't 1?

44:02.056 --> 44:04.593
J Jack of diamonds
Jack of diamonds j

44:04.725 --> 44:07.717
j I know you of old j

44:07.812 --> 44:12.101
j you've robbed my poor
pockets of silver and gold 7

44:15.319 --> 44:17.230
j you've been my downfall j

44:17.321 --> 44:18.982
j you've kicked me

44:19.073 --> 44:21.485
j but I will love you for all j

44:21.576 --> 44:23.487
j it's a whiskey, rye whiskey j

44:23.578 --> 44:25.534
j rye whiskey I try j

44:25.621 --> 44:27.486
j if I don't get rye whiskey j

44:27.582 --> 44:30.289
j I think I would die, yee-hah I

44:59.822 --> 45:00.822
What's that?

45:01.991 --> 45:04.448
Coyote. Just a lonesome coyote

45:04.535 --> 45:06.071
howling at the moon.

45:18.591 --> 45:20.422
What's independence like?

45:20.509 --> 45:22.124
It's like being free.

45:23.638 --> 45:25.003
Going anywhere you want to go,

45:25.097 --> 45:27.008
doing anything you want to do.

45:27.099 --> 45:29.260
No, I mean the town.

45:29.352 --> 45:30.592
Oh.

45:32.271 --> 45:36.230
Well, it's kind of like
a farm town, really.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.642
It ain't too far outside of
St. Louis and Kansas City.

45:39.737 --> 45:42.444
There's just plenty
to do and see,

45:42.531 --> 45:44.271
if you know what I mean.

45:44.367 --> 45:47.074
I don't really even
know what you mean.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.708
Well, better get some sleep.

45:56.796 --> 45:57.911
Youre going to need it.

45:59.966 --> 46:01.456
Good night, Mr. Cole.

46:03.135 --> 46:04.375
Good night, Mrs. eriksson.

46:06.264 --> 46:07.595
Pleasant dreams.

46:07.682 --> 46:08.682
You too.

46:14.689 --> 46:16.020
Still, still!

46:16.107 --> 46:18.189
The Indians are coming.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.022
Go this way.

46:26.659 --> 46:28.387
The Indian are coming!

46:28.411 --> 46:29.446
What's going on?

46:29.537 --> 46:32.745
The Indians,
they are massacring each other

46:32.873 --> 46:35.410
and anyone who
gets in their way.

46:35.501 --> 46:38.493
The Pawnee,
they are going so crazy,

46:38.587 --> 46:41.875
they are using human
sacrifice in their rituals.

46:41.966 --> 46:44.924
Especially the young
Cheyenne women.

46:45.011 --> 46:47.297
Ya, it was
the most horrible thing

46:47.388 --> 46:49.003
we have ever seen.

46:49.098 --> 46:50.963
Don't go there, please.

46:51.058 --> 46:53.674
I have to find my husband.

46:53.769 --> 46:57.102
I'm so sorry, ma'am,
but he's probably dead now.

46:57.189 --> 46:58.520
Don't go there.

46:58.607 --> 46:59.813
I have to!

47:02.028 --> 47:04.861
S507? - So what?

47:04.947 --> 47:06.107
Well, you want to keep going?

47:08.492 --> 47:09.492
Of course.

47:14.332 --> 47:16.288
Mr. Cole?

47:16.375 --> 47:18.582
Would you like to ride
in my wagon with me?

47:20.379 --> 47:22.244
Much obliged, ma'am.

47:22.340 --> 47:25.423
If you don't mind, Mr. Cole,
my Christian name is Alice.

47:25.509 --> 47:26.794
Please use it.

47:26.927 --> 47:30.010
1 do not like ma'am,
it's short for madam,

47:30.097 --> 47:31.928
which may well be
the name of an owner

47:35.936 --> 47:36.936
terrible, eh?

47:38.147 --> 47:39.307
All right, Alice.

47:40.441 --> 47:41.647
My name's Emmett.

47:45.196 --> 47:48.029
Pleased to make your
acquaintance, Emmett.

47:48.991 --> 47:50.356
Shall we go?

47:50.451 --> 47:51.782
Why not?

48:22.108 --> 48:23.108
Thank you.

48:27.655 --> 48:29.236
Move it, pepper.

48:47.383 --> 48:49.248
Highwaymen, thieves of the road.

48:49.343 --> 48:50.549
Give us all you got!

48:50.636 --> 48:51.636
Yeah, everything!

48:51.720 --> 48:53.176
Don't make us kill you!

48:53.264 --> 48:55.264
We wouldn't want to make
you do anything like that.

48:56.267 --> 48:57.507
What is it you want, anyway?

48:58.686 --> 49:01.098
Valuables.
Any kind of valuables.

49:01.188 --> 49:03.895
You mean stuff that's
worth something, right?

49:04.024 --> 49:06.231
Right, right.
Stuff that's worth stuff.

49:06.318 --> 49:08.479
Well, I've got two things
that are worth stuff.

49:08.571 --> 49:10.857
- What's that?
- I've got these.

49:16.370 --> 49:17.370
Let's get going.

49:19.206 --> 49:21.413
Aren't you going to bury 'em?
Fuck 'em.

49:21.500 --> 49:22.831
Let the wolves eat 'em.

49:23.836 --> 49:24.836
Come on.

49:29.508 --> 49:30.668
Come on, pepper.

49:31.802 --> 49:33.884
So, Alice,
what's your maiden name?

49:33.971 --> 49:36.212
- Nykvist.
- What's that?

49:36.307 --> 49:39.299
It's from Sweden
but I was born in red cloud.

49:39.393 --> 49:40.849
Is that a big town?

49:42.438 --> 49:43.644
Red cloud is not.

49:43.731 --> 49:46.347
And Sweden is in northern Europe

49:46.442 --> 49:49.354
near Norway and Finland.

49:49.445 --> 49:50.935
Huh.

49:51.030 --> 49:53.316
- What town are your folks from?
- Goteborg.

49:53.407 --> 49:55.523
Goteborg, is that a big town?

49:55.618 --> 49:58.781
I've never been there, but yes,
from what I hear it is a big town.

49:58.871 --> 50:01.283
Over a 100,000 people
as my folks tell me.

50:01.373 --> 50:03.580
Ooh, yeah, sure is a big town.

50:03.667 --> 50:05.328
That's as big as Kansas City.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.873
Is independence
near Kansas City?

50:08.964 --> 50:10.545
Nope.

50:10.633 --> 50:12.589
400 miles as the crow flies.

50:14.261 --> 50:16.968
Yes, everything
in America is far apart,

50:17.097 --> 50:19.964
but then again, everything
in Sweden is far apart

50:20.059 --> 50:21.469
as they tell me too.

50:22.394 --> 50:23.429
It sure is.

50:25.147 --> 50:28.105
- It's a damn big country.
- You can say that again.

50:28.192 --> 50:30.808
Okay, it's a damn big country.

50:35.699 --> 50:36.699
Thank you.

50:37.701 --> 50:40.738
Do you ever feel
like you're all alone

50:40.829 --> 50:42.615
in the universe?

50:42.706 --> 50:44.446
Hell, all the time.

50:45.834 --> 50:46.834
Me too.

50:48.796 --> 50:50.661
Sometimes I'll be
plowing the field

50:50.756 --> 50:52.292
or doing the dishes,

50:52.383 --> 50:54.089
and then I'll drift off

50:54.176 --> 50:56.508
and I'm all alone in the world.

50:56.595 --> 51:00.338
No husband, no kids, ho nobody.

51:02.893 --> 51:04.975
I spent most of my life alone

51:06.146 --> 51:07.226
underneath the stars.

51:09.483 --> 51:11.348
1 try not to think
about it too much.

51:12.528 --> 51:13.643
Nope, me neither.

51:15.322 --> 51:16.607
You going to eat those crumbs?

51:17.700 --> 51:18.700
I'll take "em.

51:30.588 --> 51:32.453
Here,
let me show you how to fish.

51:33.882 --> 51:36.589
Mr. Cole, I know how to fish.

51:36.677 --> 51:39.168
No, you don't.
Gals don't know how to fish.

51:39.263 --> 51:41.470
Surely you jest, sir.

51:41.557 --> 51:44.424
Hell no. This is, this is
something you got to know.

51:45.394 --> 51:46.884
Here, let me show you.

51:48.188 --> 51:51.680
And what, might I ask,
are you using for bait?

51:52.776 --> 51:56.360
Oh, well,
I guess I forgot about that.

51:56.447 --> 51:57.812
I'll just go dig
me up some worms.

51:57.906 --> 52:00.238
How about this?

52:00.326 --> 52:02.487
- Where'd you get that?
- It fell into my lap

52:02.578 --> 52:04.193
so I put it into my pocket.

52:05.414 --> 52:06.904
Oh.

52:06.999 --> 52:09.035
I guess that'll work, I suppose.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.366
It might.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.247
As opposed to a bare hook.

52:13.422 --> 52:14.422
Good point.

52:16.091 --> 52:17.091

52:23.432 --> 52:25.673
- Smells good.
- Yup.

52:28.228 --> 52:30.514
Nobody's ever cooked
for me before.

52:30.606 --> 52:32.096
Really?

52:32.232 --> 52:33.232
Yeah, really.

52:34.109 --> 52:35.519
Never, not once.

52:36.528 --> 52:38.143
But you're a grown man.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.105

52:44.662 --> 52:47.825
So, you cook for this varmint
of a husband of yours?

52:48.999 --> 52:51.911
I prefer that you not
refer to him that way.

52:52.795 --> 52:56.083
But yes,
I cooked for him and the kids

52:56.173 --> 52:57.879
three times a day.

52:57.966 --> 53:00.457
Until he left, that is.

53:01.845 --> 53:03.426

he liked your cooking?

53:05.641 --> 53:07.131
Nope.

53:07.226 --> 53:08.386
He never did.

53:09.561 --> 53:10.767

53:11.939 --> 53:13.520
I don't know, Mr. Cole.

53:13.607 --> 53:15.939
Suppose you'll have to
find out for yourself.

53:17.277 --> 53:19.484
Call me Emmett, please.

53:19.571 --> 53:20.571
Okay, Emmett.

euphemistically say.

53:24.243 --> 53:27.280

So hungry I can eat a cow.

53:27.371 --> 53:31.284
No doubt. But tonight,
a fish will have to suffice.

53:31.375 --> 53:32.785
If you say so.

53:32.876 --> 53:35.367
Yes, Emmett, I do.

54:30.934 --> 54:32.219
Oh, shit.

54:44.990 --> 54:46.196
What's wrong?

54:48.786 --> 54:50.447
Ain't no fun killing people.

54:51.872 --> 54:53.487
No, I expect not.

54:54.750 --> 54:58.334
I've even killed a few people who didn't deserve
to die, just 'cause they got in my way.

55:00.464 --> 55:01.704
Just life, I guess.

55:03.300 --> 55:04.506
Did you regret that?

55:04.593 --> 55:06.584
No, I ain't,
I ain't got no regrets.

55:07.513 --> 55:09.094
None that I could think of.

55:12.226 --> 55:14.146
None that I want to think
about right now anyway.

55:22.277 --> 55:23.983
Well, we should
get some shuteye.
