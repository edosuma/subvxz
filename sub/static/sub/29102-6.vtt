WEBVTT

01:20.371 --> 01:22.248
Well, she's-- she's my rock.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.795
What-- What am I supposed to do
without her, you know? It...

01:29.631 --> 01:30.799
Ow!

01:31.216 --> 01:32.425
Nut up, man.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.762
This is the universe telling you
you're not meant to be tied down.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.182
Look, I was living
with a chick once, right?

01:39.265 --> 01:40.892
And she wanted me to put a ring on it.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.393
And I thought I was gonna have to,

01:42.477 --> 01:44.771
because I was living in her place,
which was sweet.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.733
Then one day she comes home,
catches me boning her first cousin,

01:48.817 --> 01:53.279
breaks up with me, but more important,
thinks the place is tainted and moves out.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.991
Who's got two thumbs and is living
in a sweet Huh?

01:57.075 --> 02:00.453
Place has a friggin' gym in the building
and she left her Instant Pot.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.872
You gotta look at the bigger picture here.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.541
But she's...

02:04.958 --> 02:06.000
Morning.

02:11.464 --> 02:15.760
Oh, ooh. Taystee?
Can you give me a hand, please?

02:16.803 --> 02:18.513
Shit.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.270
Did you hear me calling you for help?

02:25.979 --> 02:26.855
What?

02:27.814 --> 02:29.440
Do I have any messages?

02:31.651 --> 02:34.654
-Taystee, did you take down--
-Linda's office called.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.281
Great. Just call her back.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.783
She said she wants you
to come in for a meeting.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.827
-Mmm-hmm.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.831
In person? In person is serious.
She say what it was about?

02:45.415 --> 02:47.333
Uh... No.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.837
I'm doing everything
they told me to.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.882
I've signed my name so many times,
I'm spelling my own name wrong.

02:54.048 --> 02:57.260
Um, I bet Hopper told her
about my programs.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.761
That's why he wouldn't look at me.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.306
When's this meeting?
I need time to prepare.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.185
You okay?

03:05.852 --> 03:08.438
Yeah, sorry, I just got a lot on my mind.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.439
Yeah.

03:18.281 --> 03:21.117
It was Thursday. Thursday.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.327
Thank you.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.122
Why is there Wite-Out
on the signature line?

03:27.123 --> 03:28.625
Did she forget her own damn name?

03:29.834 --> 03:33.087
I got shirts older
than this new warden.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.132
Anyhow, your paperwork is in order,

03:36.216 --> 03:39.427
but I still need the address
for where you'll be staying after release.

03:39.510 --> 03:40.887
You got that for me?

03:42.513 --> 03:43.348
No.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.851
Well, have you at least
reached out to your family?

03:47.268 --> 03:49.187
No, I ain't got around to it yet.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.105
Ms. Hayes, look at me.

03:52.273 --> 03:56.194
You have to have some place to go.
The halfway houses are at capacity.

03:56.819 --> 03:57.779
Sorry.

03:58.112 --> 04:01.032
Don't apologize to me.
Just get me an address.

04:02.992 --> 04:03.993
Okay.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.791
-I know. I know. I know.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.000
Do you?

04:11.751 --> 04:14.963
Do you know how friggin' lucky you are
that you just got sent to NA?

04:15.046 --> 04:16.589
She could have sent you back here.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.299
What if that's what my subconscious wants?

04:18.383 --> 04:19.759
No.

04:19.842 --> 04:23.721
I think I just wanted to feel something.
It was stupid and I'm sorry.

04:24.389 --> 04:28.351
Well, why don't you find someone
other than your brother to hang out with?

04:28.434 --> 04:29.394
What about Neri?

04:29.477 --> 04:31.104
I'm not on her good side at the moment.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.564
Cal basically had to promise
that we'd be her slaves

04:33.648 --> 04:34.774
so she wouldn't kick us out.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.277
How about some girls from work?

04:38.987 --> 04:41.823
I think they know I'm the one
that cookie-monstered their cake.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.701
Wow, here I was thinking
I was the reckless one.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.120
I guess we're two fucked up peas in a pod.

04:48.496 --> 04:51.416
-I wanna be in your pod.
-I know. Me, too.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.254
Too bad we're not even
in the same garden.

05:03.553 --> 05:07.056
Pipes, do you need to find
some other peas to pod with?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.224
What?

05:09.642 --> 05:10.727
No.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.564
You're my pea, you're my pod.
Why would you even ask me that?

05:14.647 --> 05:18.067
Just... hear me out.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.821
You clearly need something more
in your life.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.575
You know, someone outside of this glass.

05:25.658 --> 05:30.705
Someone who can touch you, and it's legal,
and it feels good.

05:30.788 --> 05:33.624
I'm not saying I wanna know details,
but, um...

05:35.043 --> 05:37.420
-Dangerous.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.089
This is very, very dangerous. And what you're doing isn't?

05:44.594 --> 05:49.891
Look, there's no way you're replacing
this golden pussy. I know that.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.810
But I also know that you feel restricted
by all these rules

05:52.894 --> 05:57.148
and I don't want you to resent
our relationship for, like, confining you.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.650
I don't resent us.

06:01.861 --> 06:05.281
Piper, this is all I can do for you
from in here.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.284
Let me do this for you.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.994
This is ridiculous.

06:12.413 --> 06:14.374
Besides, I haven't even been in the mood.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.378
Well, we have three years to go.
So just think about it.

06:19.837 --> 06:23.549
As much as I wanna be with you,
I don't want you back in here.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.430
My God, she's climbing the stairs already?

06:30.556 --> 06:32.558
It's going so fast.

06:33.976 --> 06:36.229
-Yes.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.647
Told you she's advanced.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.192
-"Yes."

06:41.943 --> 06:43.486
-Her new word is "yes."
-Oh.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.864
-And also "duck."

06:46.948 --> 06:48.950
Duck like quack-quack.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.869
-Hmm.
-And she makes the quack noise, too.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.955
But it's more like "cack."

06:54.539 --> 06:55.790
She's a genius.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.254
Listen, I gotta tell you something.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.216
I'm seeing someone.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.052
We said we weren't gonna talk
about those things.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.637
This one is different.

07:10.304 --> 07:14.934
-A month. Sergio introduced us.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.187
-I don't wanna hear about it.
-I gotta be honest with you.

07:18.271 --> 07:23.734
Well, you also gotta leave Pepa out of it.
A month is a short time.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.362
And I don't want her getting all attached
to some rando

07:26.446 --> 07:28.614
that you're gonna drop in another month.

07:30.199 --> 07:34.996
And what the fuck is Sergio doing
introducing you to girls? He's my cousin.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.456
Pepa and I are moving in with her.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.999
The fuck you are!

07:41.627 --> 07:42.712
You won't bring Pepa here

07:42.795 --> 07:44.589
because you don't want her
to see her mother in prison,

07:44.672 --> 07:48.676
but you're okay to let her see you
screwing some fling?

07:48.759 --> 07:51.804
-No. Nuh-uh. Not happening.
-It's not a fling.

07:54.182 --> 07:57.768
This is serious, and you don't get
to choose what we do.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.481
-Of course I do. I'm Pepa's mother.
-But you're in here.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.610
Leave Pepa out of it.

08:07.069 --> 08:10.990
Well, I may be in here, but I know you.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.912
And I know that your fling
or whatever ain't gonna work out.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.332
I seen you in love. With me.

08:19.415 --> 08:23.044
And this ain't like that.
This is sex or whatever.

08:26.964 --> 08:29.175
Well, I guess
I love me some Guess.

08:31.093 --> 08:35.139
I guess I love wearing Guess.
It makes me feel so sexy and rich.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.072
-Stop, stop.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.574
Ooh.

08:53.658 --> 08:57.453
<i>Princesa,</i> you should only ever be dressed
in the finest.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.830
Well, it's coming off. Oh, my God.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.625
Orlando would shit himself
if he knew I had sex in this dress.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.085
-Shit.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.212
Well, he's off somewhere in Europe.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.132
-You're the boss now.

09:12.051 --> 09:15.555
Oh, my God.
-There. Now, you own it.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.641
You're so lucky I got a price tag gun.

09:18.724 --> 09:22.144
I can't afford that. Plus, I got
no place fancy to wear it anyhow.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.899
Well, maybe I have the fix for that.

09:36.951 --> 09:40.621
We got a whole table of True Religions.
You need a new idea.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.664
Mmm-mmm.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.542
These are a third of the price.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.589
-No, don't worry about it.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.174
-Tell people that it's the new design.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.803
The name's on the label. Hmm? The way they're gonna feel in them
is the same.

09:58.306 --> 10:03.060
The only other difference
is the extra cash lining your pockets

10:03.144 --> 10:06.480
when you sell these full retail. Hmm?

10:06.856 --> 10:09.400
Then we can go to clubs

10:10.192 --> 10:13.613
and fancy restaurants.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.282
Show off this body.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.576
What do you think?

10:22.622 --> 10:23.456
Shit.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.961
Is that the boyfriend?

10:31.839 --> 10:34.342
-I'll be back in 20 minutes.
-I'll wait.

10:35.551 --> 10:39.430
I can always wait for you, <i>Princesa.</i>

10:48.939 --> 10:50.983
You want to go out to lunch tomorrow?

10:52.151 --> 10:53.194
We're out.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.031
No, I mean like some place
they bring you food to your table.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.033
I like it here.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.879
Stop hoggin' those chips.
You wanna look flabby in the ring?

11:12.630 --> 11:13.631
I'm taking a break.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.217
When were you gonna tell me this?

11:16.884 --> 11:19.887
I'm still getting the headaches.
And I'm doing good here.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.099
I got 30 Pro Access sign ups.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.351
Thirty more
and they make me assistant manager.

11:28.062 --> 11:32.608
Sergio called.
Luis got picked up selling H last night.

11:33.234 --> 11:36.570
He did

11:36.654 --> 11:41.659
Everyone's gettin' popped lately.
Big Leo, George, Chickie Jr.

11:42.618 --> 11:43.744
All goin' down.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.414
It's good we got out when we did.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.001
You ever miss it?

11:52.294 --> 11:57.466
We're together.
We're safe, we have food. I'm thankful.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.803
I am so thankful for another day

12:01.679 --> 12:05.891
in this shit mall
with my damp ham and cheese.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.602
Gotta give it a little time.

12:09.812 --> 12:13.065
With assistant manager money
and what you're making as a manager,

12:13.149 --> 12:15.359
soon we'll be buying
Panda Express for lunch.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.236
Can't wait.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.032
There.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.829
You are right.
This place does make the DMV look cheery.

12:26.912 --> 12:30.082
Why don't you have some underpaid laborer
knock down that wall

12:30.166 --> 12:32.877
and get yourself some breathing room.
You are the warden.

12:32.960 --> 12:37.965
ICE has all the power around here.
I am just a form-filling figurehead.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.760
Here, this'll make you feel better.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.261
You can be good

12:42.344 --> 12:45.973
and you can reward yourself
for being good.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.516
What do you want?

12:47.600 --> 12:51.729
Can we talk without a desk between us?

12:53.314 --> 12:57.902
You have as long as it takes me
to finish this Tony's Chocolonely.

12:57.985 --> 13:03.449
Then I gotta get back to begging
petty bureaucrats for Imam visitation.

13:03.532 --> 13:07.745
I swear, I should get them a special stamp
that reads "fuck the ragheads"

13:07.828 --> 13:11.791
for them to pound into anything
that says the word "Muslim" on it.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.961
-I saw the doctor this morning.

13:16.754 --> 13:21.967
Well, he said my guys are sparse
and sleepy "swimmers."

13:28.682 --> 13:31.060
I've never heard you laugh before.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.687
It is unnerving.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.984
So, what are they gonna do
to wake your guys up?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.820
They're gonna pour coffee into my dick.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.279
-No!

13:42.988 --> 13:46.033
I'd have to have a surgery on my balls.

13:46.325 --> 13:50.412
Well, as long as your beer can
still pops its top, cut 'em open.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.747
No, it's just...

13:52.748 --> 13:54.124
It just got me thinking.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.920
Your eggs are old, my sperms are tired.

13:58.546 --> 14:02.007
Maybe it's a sign we just sit back
and enjoy each other's company.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.425
No fucking way.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.719
I've been shooting my ass up
with hormones for months.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.596
You can get a tiny ball surgery.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.057
What do you want me
to pass along to a kid, anyway?

14:10.140 --> 14:12.351
More hair in his ears than on his scalp?

14:12.434 --> 14:17.189
Our kid will be 100% me.
My genes are not recessive.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.691
I don't think science works like that.

14:18.774 --> 14:24.446
Fine. It can be one percent you.
There are parts of you I like.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.867
-Uh-huh.

14:29.785 --> 14:34.874
-Your puppy dog eyes are tolerable.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.919
That'll do, Fig. That will do.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.179
You're getting the surgery.

14:49.263 --> 14:52.558
I am not getting my balls fucking snipped.

14:52.641 --> 14:56.729
My balls are cut off every day here.
Do you see me quitting?

14:56.812 --> 14:59.064
No more cutting balls talk.

15:03.694 --> 15:04.737
Really?

15:07.656 --> 15:09.450
Where's the rest of that chocolate?

15:15.164 --> 15:17.666
Oh. Uh...
-Mmm.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.793
Please come in. I'm so sorry

15:19.877 --> 15:22.296
about the food-meeting double tasking.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.173
My Gyrotonic teacher
was late this morning.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.550
It snowballed my entire day. Please sit.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.318
I know you may have heard
about the programs.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.653
What programs?

15:46.362 --> 15:52.451
Oh, the GED and motivational courses
for the inmates.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.704
N-- Nothing even worth
talking about, really.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.748
How much is this costing me?

15:57.831 --> 15:59.875
Nothing. They're all volunteer led.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.460
-Then, great!
-Yeah.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.879
That's a solid talking point
for your <i>Channel 3 News</i> interview.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.007
Although, when you say it to the camera,
really sell it.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.509
You know, something like,

16:08.592 --> 16:12.471
"We have an array of exciting motivational
courses available to all of our inmates."

16:12.554 --> 16:13.806
Um, what interview?

16:14.306 --> 16:16.392
Did you not get the press release
from this morning?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.228
We are shutting down the Psych Ward

16:19.311 --> 16:21.063
and converting it
into more inmate housing.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.858
Wow. Uh... wow.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.819
I know. That's exciting, right?

16:26.902 --> 16:28.988
Uh, we're not concerned about

16:29.071 --> 16:32.199
how we're gonna handle
Psych inmates with gen pop?

16:32.282 --> 16:33.742
They were in Psych for a reason.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.703
I've already spoken
to several federal hospitals

16:35.786 --> 16:39.164
and they have room for some
of our more challenging patients.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.709
And the rest you can just
take care of with medications.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.378
It's a buyer's market for lithium now.
We should really stock up.

16:44.461 --> 16:48.173
Well,
meds aren't all one size fits all.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.884
There's also Thorazine or Prolixin.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.722
You know, you should spend some time
with our PolyCon approval manual.

16:54.805 --> 16:55.889
It lists all the medications

16:55.973 --> 16:57.683
-that we get special rates on.
-Mmm.

16:58.308 --> 17:02.062
Full-priced medications are for suckers,
am I right

17:02.146 --> 17:05.232
Hurray for corporate discounts.
Here are your talking points.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.316
Whoa.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.945
I'm-- I'm not sure I'm the best person
to be talking about this.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.031
I've never even done an interview before.

17:12.114 --> 17:16.994
You'll be great! The young, fresh,
ethnic face of Litchfield Max.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.620
The camera will love you.

17:19.288 --> 17:22.249
And wear your hair just like that.
It's wonderful.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.837
This is going to be an important week.

17:26.920 --> 17:30.758
We are going to be writing letters
to people from our past who--

17:30.841 --> 17:34.470
Ooh! I'm gonna write Raleigh Peck,
from high school. He played quarterback.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.346
Dibs on Eckhart Tolle.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.057
I am writing to Tolle.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.226
His <i>Power of Now</i> calendar
is my flashlight cutting through the fog,

17:41.310 --> 17:42.436
so back the fuck off.

17:42.519 --> 17:46.774
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Please, let me clarify.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.234
You'll be writing an apology

17:49.818 --> 17:55.115
to someone who was a victim
of something you did in the past.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.992
But what if my crime don't got a victim?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.994
Right. I'm innocent, too.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.372
Doesn't necessarily have to be the victim
of the crimes that got you in here.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.209
So you're talking about the crimes
we didn't get caught for?

18:05.709 --> 18:07.002
Get off the crime of it.

18:07.503 --> 18:12.466
And think about the trauma
you might have inflicted on someone,

18:13.467 --> 18:16.470
intentionally or unintentionally.

18:20.641 --> 18:24.686
All right, let's do
a visualization exercise, huh?

18:25.479 --> 18:26.647
Everyone close your eyes.

18:27.648 --> 18:31.360
Come on, come on. Close your eyes. Yeah?

18:33.278 --> 18:38.408
Imagine you're getting into an elevator
with another person

18:39.201 --> 18:41.453
and you can't see their face yet

18:41.537 --> 18:44.081
because they're staring down
at their phone.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.791
So fucking rude.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.169
Shh! You're fucking rude for interrupting.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.963
The elevator's going up.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.925
Seventh floor. Eighth floor.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.094
Ninth floor.

18:57.177 --> 19:00.848
All of a sudden, the elevator shakes
and gets stuck.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.684
You turn to the other person for help

19:04.560 --> 19:10.732
only to realize it's someone
you did something horrible to.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.027
Who is that person,

19:14.611 --> 19:17.364
hmm, you'd hate to be trapped
on that elevator with?

19:21.285 --> 19:23.579
I'm gonna write a letter
to Raleigh Peck's girlfriend.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.999
I'm taking the stairs instead.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.626
I'm the real victim here.
Where's my fucking letter?

19:30.377 --> 19:35.007
My mom left and didn't write no letter.
My dad's an asshole, no letter.

19:36.258 --> 19:40.596
I took the fall for the riot.
My man's moving in with some bitch.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.015
I mean, I should write myself a letter.

19:43.098 --> 19:46.393
"Dear self,
sorry everyone in your life's been shit."

19:47.311 --> 19:49.104
Try to dig a little deeper.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.191
All right, come on. Let's get to it.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.783
Give it a shot.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.623
Hayes, is there a problem?
Let's talk about it.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.376
You were in my imagination elevator.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.129
My letter is to you.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.465
Didn't you kill your kids?

20:17.257 --> 20:20.010
Yeah, but they-- they can't read.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.728
<i>Princesa,</i> when you gonna break up
with that guy?

20:31.355 --> 20:32.773
When you gonna leave your wife?

20:32.856 --> 20:34.983
As soon as you leave yours,
I'll leave mine.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.069
It's complicated.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.073
We got history.
He got me out of my dad's house.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.866
Do you love him?

20:43.617 --> 20:44.910
I love you.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.705
-You're fun.
-Hmm. Mmm-hmm.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.041
And you talk.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.544
It sure ain't like that with him. But...

20:55.837 --> 20:57.965
you gotta give me some time
to do it right.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.969
I owe him that much.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.011
Maria?

21:04.972 --> 21:07.849
There's a lady doing weird shit out here.
I can't deal.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.654
What the

21:22.739 --> 21:25.242
What are you, some kinda pervert?
Get outta here.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.159
I need to speak to your manager.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.036
I'm the manager.
Out, before I call the cops.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.288
I am the cops.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.874
And you're under arrest
for trafficking in counterfeit goods.

21:37.170 --> 21:41.466
You two? You-- You looked so good
in those jeans I sold you the other day.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.136
That's because they are real
True Religion jeans.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.221
Right from the factory in Los Angeles.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.432
No, my guess is
they came from China.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.142
All fakes have that mildewy smell

21:50.225 --> 21:53.895
because manufacturers stuff 'em
in plastic bags before they're even dry.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.941
People like you make my job too easy.
Now, move. Move your feet.

22:01.778 --> 22:02.863
Hey.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.407
Hey, who's gonna close up?

22:05.490 --> 22:06.825
Thanks for letting me in. Well, normally I couldn't do this,

22:09.077 --> 22:12.581
but our head guard is currently
locked in the break room crying,

22:12.664 --> 22:14.499
so I think I can do anything I want.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.971
Don't come in here
unless you have a death wish.

22:30.390 --> 22:34.144
Jesus Christ!
There's something dead in here.

22:34.978 --> 22:38.023
-No, it's my soul.

22:39.316 --> 22:42.694
You feeling okay? You walked out on class.

22:42.778 --> 22:46.365
There's no point in going
if I won't finish.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.408
I'm getting out next week.

22:49.493 --> 22:53.622
Congratulations! That is amazing, Hayes.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.250
Come back to class.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.837
Huh? We'll come up with a plan for you
to keep it going on the outside.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.258
I'm only getting out
'cause I fucked over my best friend.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.386
Ain't no letter gonna fix what I done.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.846
You don't believe that.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.641
You showed up
to restorative justice class.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.309
You made that choice for yourself.

23:14.976 --> 23:18.230
'Cause I didn't want to end up like no...

23:19.481 --> 23:22.734
crazy, old, smelly-ass,
cockroach-loving hoarder.

23:25.570 --> 23:29.032
But now, I get it. This is my punishment.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.994
I don't know what this is,
but you served your time.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.496
You can leave it all behind.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.623
You build whatever life
you want out there.

23:36.706 --> 23:38.959
I don't deserve to be released.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.168
Come back to class.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.588
Work on being the person that deserves it.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.176
Don't focus
on what you can't fix.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.720
Focus on what you can.

23:50.804 --> 23:55.434
Yeah, while you're fixing stuff,
maybe get to that toilet.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.060
It hasn't worked in days.

24:01.815 --> 24:02.899
Get out of this cell.

24:03.483 --> 24:06.528
Fresh air'll give you a new perspective
and some sanity.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.572
See you in class.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.909
Yeah. One day,

24:12.993 --> 24:16.621
some do-gooder'll start
a recycling program here,

24:17.456 --> 24:19.416
and I'm gonna be ready.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.001
I'll make a killing.

24:40.228 --> 24:43.648
Hey. How's intel coming along?

24:43.732 --> 24:45.233
Nothing good yet.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.319
Then why you out here?

24:48.695 --> 24:51.114
I got other shit I gotta deal with first.

24:51.823 --> 24:54.618
Oh, yeah? Shit that's more important
than our little project?

24:58.747 --> 25:01.458
Cindy's getting out on early release.

25:01.958 --> 25:05.921
She lied on the stand, she betrayed me,
and she gets to go free.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.968
-Fuck.
-Yep.

25:15.013 --> 25:19.935
Look at her rubbin' her
little freedom Cheetos in your face.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.437
-That's some mad disrespect right there.
-I know.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.898
What should we do to her?

25:24.981 --> 25:27.943
"We"? You know I ain't got no money.

25:29.277 --> 25:32.197
Nah. This one's on me.

25:33.073 --> 25:36.326
See, rats, they bring disease.
They make everybody sick.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.956
And you my lifer-sister,
at least until you pay me to die.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.875
You know what?

25:43.959 --> 25:46.503
I could have Adeola teach her
how gravity works.

25:46.586 --> 25:51.341
Nah, man. I don't want to have
nobody getting thrown off no balcony.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.302
Or maybe we could plant a shiv?

25:55.262 --> 25:57.639
Hmm? Steal her date.

25:58.807 --> 25:59.766
Hmm.

26:01.851 --> 26:04.729
But I really don't want to see her face
around here no more.

26:05.438 --> 26:08.775
What do you care?
You're not gonna be here for much longer.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.737
Oh, shit.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.616
Yo, we could rearrange her face
like on some Picasso shit.

26:17.450 --> 26:20.412
Yeah, I think this is something
I gotta do myself.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.374
Hey, I'm Jason. I'm an addict.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.001
Hi, Jason.

26:26.585 --> 26:30.088
Ten years ago today,
I took my last 15 oxys.

26:32.757 --> 26:33.592
And it's because

26:33.675 --> 26:35.093
-all of you kept repeating...

26:35.176 --> 26:38.054
...this mantra to me
until I finally believed it.

26:38.513 --> 26:41.016
"Keep coming back
because you're worth it."

26:42.892 --> 26:45.520
Oh, man, I thought
it was so corny at first.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.689
But I kept coming back

26:47.772 --> 26:50.942
because people like you
kept telling me to come back.

26:51.610 --> 26:57.490
And then one day I finally heard it.
I'm worth it.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.368
I had never let myself think that before

27:00.452 --> 27:03.121
because my parents never allowed me
to think that.

27:03.204 --> 27:07.000
It wasn't enough to be a great swimmer.
I had to be perfect.

27:07.751 --> 27:11.921
This meant no hanging out with friends,
definitely no girlfriends.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.591
No TV, no video games.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.052
There were so many rules.

27:17.135 --> 27:20.096
I couldn't even take a bathroom break
without being timed.

27:20.180 --> 27:24.017
So when my dad came home
with meds from his knee surgery,

27:25.185 --> 27:26.269
I took one.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.439
It was my way of rebelling.

27:31.316 --> 27:35.236
I personally put their Imam request
on your desk.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.489
It is sitting there right in front of you.

27:37.572 --> 27:41.701
I expect it signed and back on my desk
tomorrow morning!

27:44.913 --> 27:48.083
-Yes!

27:48.875 --> 27:50.251
I brought you this.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.296
Mmm. I'm a sucker for a gift bag.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.549
Ta

27:58.927 --> 28:03.556
What about me makes you think
I'm a plant person?

28:04.391 --> 28:09.854
I-- I heard that, uh, plants do better
with a companion plant.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.316
Even if they hate each other,
the hate makes them live longer.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.777
Clearly you've been talking to Joe.

28:15.860 --> 28:19.989
He loves to attribute human emotions
to leaves and twigs.

28:20.073 --> 28:23.243
So what have you two merry crusaders
hit a wall on?

28:23.326 --> 28:27.872
He said, uh, he's not as good
with Linda-related things as you are.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.375
And I've heard
how well you've handled her.

28:30.458 --> 28:34.212
Yeah. I handled her so well
I ended up here.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.548
So what is the conniving turd up to now?

28:38.007 --> 28:40.719
She is shutting down Psych.

28:41.094 --> 28:43.722
Of course she is. Jesus.

28:43.805 --> 28:46.599
It's probably great
for PolyCon's stock projections.

28:46.683 --> 28:50.019
Well, it's dangerous to put Psych inmates
with regular inmates.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.604
They need specialized care.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.398
And I've done some research.
I've got the numbers--

28:53.481 --> 28:57.110
Save your energy.
That train has left the station. You just have to decide if you wanna
get on board, or at least pretend to.

29:01.865 --> 29:06.327
Pretending with Linda is one thing, uh,
but she's having me speak to the press.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.830
You're her human shield. I...

29:09.873 --> 29:13.126
I have got to hand it to her.
She is outdoing herself.

29:14.419 --> 29:20.133
I'm not a good liar.
The press is gonna eat me alive.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.473
No, they won't.

29:27.182 --> 29:31.269
Because I'm going to teach you something.
It's called pivot and deflect.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.313
Sounds like a dance move.

29:33.396 --> 29:35.106
It is a dance.

29:35.190 --> 29:39.486
They-- They step forward with a question,
you step to the side

29:39.569 --> 29:42.405
and answer the question
you wish they'd asked. Got it?

29:42.489 --> 29:45.492
I want to say yes
because your face says to,

29:45.575 --> 29:47.076
but I don't got it.

29:47.160 --> 29:53.792
Okay, um, pretend you're the interviewer
and ask me if I like your present.

29:53.875 --> 29:57.212
Uh... do you like the plant
that I gave you?

29:57.295 --> 30:00.799
Uh, that is a great question.

30:00.882 --> 30:04.385
But this isn't about
my enjoyment of succulents.

30:04.469 --> 30:09.432
It is about the enjoyment
they can bring to everyone.

30:09.516 --> 30:13.686
So I need you to make sure those plants

30:13.770 --> 30:19.025
bring joy to as many people as possible.

30:20.401 --> 30:21.319
Here.

30:22.403 --> 30:26.074
I am so glad that you are doing this.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.410
You are good at this.

30:32.413 --> 30:35.583
"I'm sorry,
dear maples of Vermont...

30:37.919 --> 30:40.380
for wasting your sticky sweetness,

30:41.130 --> 30:42.465
your lifeblood,

30:43.675 --> 30:45.093
to drown a man.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.679
I'm sorry,

30:49.264 --> 30:50.682
and I'm thankful."

30:53.393 --> 30:55.395
Some people deserve to die.

30:57.814 --> 30:58.982
All right, then.

30:59.649 --> 31:04.654
I'm not sure that the maples necessarily
should be the recipient of your apology,

31:05.738 --> 31:07.240
but it was heartfelt.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.243
I eat pancakes dry as penance.

31:10.326 --> 31:14.205
Okay, then. Uh, Ruiz, you're up.

31:21.629 --> 31:23.172
"Fuck you, Yadriel.

31:24.841 --> 31:30.597
I don't give you permission
to take my baby to live with some ho."

31:30.680 --> 31:32.223
Time out. Time out.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.893
It's the word "ho," isn't it?
I went back and forth on that one.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.936
I know we're not supposed
to call each other that no more.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.187
Gotta take it back, ho.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.440
Change it to <i>"puta."</i>
Gives it more punch with an ethnic flair.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.233
It's not why I stopped you.

31:42.317 --> 31:45.111
I stopped you because it doesn't sound
like a letter to your victim.

31:45.194 --> 31:47.071
But I don't got a victim, remember?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.866
All I did was sell some bitches
a few fake clothes.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.452
They wanted brand names,
I gave them brand names.

31:52.535 --> 31:54.078
So who's the victim there?

31:54.162 --> 31:56.164
-Fuck a Gucci.

31:56.456 --> 32:00.835
I am the victim, so I wrote a letter
to one of my victimizers.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.211
That wasn't the assignment.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.297
That one over there apologized to trees.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.382
At least it was an apology.

32:06.966 --> 32:11.179
Uh, my advice,
go back and give it another try.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.681
Well, nobody asked you, Dear Abby.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.726
Sorry I'm late.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.398
Letter took longer than I thought.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.192
I'm glad to have you back.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.612
You

32:27.695 --> 32:30.239
Does everything that happens in here
stay in here?

32:31.658 --> 32:33.785
Of course. Right, ladies?

32:33.868 --> 32:35.370
I'll keep your secrets like Vegas.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.456
That stuff always ends up
on the Instagram.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.792
I'll keep your secrets
like we're in <i>Fight Club.</i>

32:49.384 --> 32:50.385
Um...

32:50.969 --> 32:54.597
So I have a lot of victims,

32:54.681 --> 32:57.308
and some of them
I can't do anything about right now,

32:58.351 --> 33:02.021
so I decided to start with someone
I hope I'm seein' first when I get out.

33:05.316 --> 33:08.444
"Dear Ma, I'm sorry.

33:11.030 --> 33:13.199
I don't think I ever said that to you,

33:13.783 --> 33:16.369
but if you had a dollar
for every time I should have said it,

33:17.078 --> 33:20.206
you'd be hanging with those Amazon
and Facebook dudes, countin' your money."

33:20.289 --> 33:21.874
"At the top of the list,

33:24.377 --> 33:28.214
I'm sorry I stuck you
with raising my baby as your own.

33:31.592 --> 33:37.098
I'm especially sorry
if she's anything like me.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.395
I'm also sorry
I tried to take her away from you.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.607
I know that I may be her birth mom,

33:48.192 --> 33:50.111
but you are her mom-mom.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.907
You're the person that's been in her face

33:55.408 --> 33:58.494
every day, whether she likes it or not.

33:59.537 --> 34:02.081
The person who makes her
egg and bacon smiles,

34:02.957 --> 34:06.127
gives her boob-smother hugs
when she's sick,

34:07.003 --> 34:10.298
and knows what Slurpee flavor
will get her to smile.

34:16.095 --> 34:19.182
I know how much the truth would hurt
both you and Monica,

34:19.265 --> 34:20.641
so this is the last time

34:21.934 --> 34:24.729
I'll talk about giving birth to her.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.442
And it'll be my first step
towards being the person

34:29.525 --> 34:30.735
you'd be proud to call your daughter.

34:33.821 --> 34:36.532
I hope we can all live together
when I get out, so...

34:40.244 --> 34:42.371
so I can make it up to both of you.

34:44.415 --> 34:47.126
Love, your daughter, Cindy."

34:55.551 --> 34:56.636
That's great.

35:05.228 --> 35:09.524
You have to position the claw
over the body, not the head.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.362
Use your common sense.

35:16.322 --> 35:18.324
<i> Yeah?</i>
-You picked up!

35:18.699 --> 35:19.909
Stop calling me.

35:19.992 --> 35:21.911
<i>I want to apologize.</i>

35:22.370 --> 35:24.288
Please let me say I'm sorry.

35:26.457 --> 35:30.837
I got greedy and I made the wrong choice.
I know that.

35:31.754 --> 35:33.965
-We were done with all that.
<i> I know.</i>

35:34.715 --> 35:36.300
And I screwed up our life.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.264
Don't you know how much I wish
I was in that food court right now,

35:41.347 --> 35:42.974
eating sandwiches with you?

35:44.392 --> 35:47.937
I can't do this.
Please don't call anymore.

35:48.354 --> 35:50.773
Yadriel, wait. I'm pregnant.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.778
<i>Yadriel, you there?</i>

35:58.072 --> 35:59.073
When did that happen? I don't know,

36:03.202 --> 36:05.204
but you're the only one I've been with.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.711
<i>Yadriel</i>

36:13.546 --> 36:14.505
Yadriel.

36:18.217 --> 36:19.343
I'm gonna be a daddy.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.182
Yeah.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.935
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.105
It's two-ply.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.152
Yeah, you are.

36:41.574 --> 36:42.617
<i>Take a seat.</i>

36:42.700 --> 36:43.826
<i>Good, good.</i>

36:45.953 --> 36:47.288
-Shh.

36:47.371 --> 36:50.416
Niall is cock-blocking Adam
from stealing Kendall's pussy away.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.378
Why are we watching
a bunch of Brexit voters in bikinis?

36:54.462 --> 36:57.423
-You know they didn't vote.
-Which was a vote for Brexit.

36:57.506 --> 36:59.300
But abs.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.052
You gotta stop.

37:02.470 --> 37:05.932
It's already eating your brain.
Come on, now, tell me about your day.

37:06.015 --> 37:10.019
No, I want the hot glistening bodies
to zap away my brain and my day.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.938
<i>-...you've got to keep your cards--</i>
<i> I can't.</i>

37:12.021 --> 37:13.231
<i>I'm just a bit out there.</i>

37:13.314 --> 37:16.943
Well, I had a real breakthrough
in Restorative Justice today.

37:17.026 --> 37:20.738
Yeah, I don't want to hear
about your <i>Dangerous Minds</i> bullshit

37:20.821 --> 37:22.573
while I'm stuck making the world worse

37:22.657 --> 37:25.326
at the horror version
of <i>Coming to America.</i>

37:25.409 --> 37:27.870
Well, at least we're
canceling each other out.

37:27.954 --> 37:29.497
Ha-ha-ha.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.166
Why don't you do good
and go make me some dinner?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.794
I did get you a gift at the market.

37:34.877 --> 37:37.004
Better not be another succulent.

37:37.797 --> 37:40.424
"Two can hate each other and still live."

37:40.508 --> 37:42.635
If I learned anything from <i>Love Island,</i>

37:42.718 --> 37:45.179
it's that three
will tear each other apart.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.479
Unless you're planning
on incorporating this

37:53.562 --> 37:57.358
into a deceptively low-carb carbonara,
not interested.

37:59.402 --> 38:00.778
They're not for eating.

38:01.654 --> 38:03.948
-They're for my balls.
-Jesus, Joe.

38:04.031 --> 38:06.450
-I am not kinking the way you're kinking.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.994
They're not for that, either.

38:08.619 --> 38:13.165
The doctor said I'm gonna need them
to ice my boys after the surgery.

38:16.252 --> 38:19.463
What happened to taking your balls
and staying home?

38:20.631 --> 38:22.842
During the class
you won't let me talk about,

38:24.802 --> 38:28.264
I had a realization
that maybe I do have something

38:28.347 --> 38:30.391
to contribute to the next generation.

38:33.227 --> 38:36.272
I still don't want to hear about your day,
but I'm glad.

38:36.355 --> 38:37.732
The appointment's next week.

38:37.815 --> 38:41.402
Doctor said I'd be healed and doing yoga,
if I did that kind of thing.

38:41.485 --> 38:42.987
-Yeah.
-But I'll need you to drive me.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.155
Shh. Wait.

38:44.530 --> 38:48.326
Oh, my God. Uh, why are
none of these women going for the doctor?

38:48.409 --> 38:51.078
<i>...Alex has seen</i>
<i>some pretty nasty injuries.</i>

38:51.162 --> 38:53.331
<i>But every doctor knows</i>
<i>nothing hurts more...</i>

38:53.414 --> 38:54.540
<i>It's important to note</i>

38:54.623 --> 38:57.918
<i>that while the inmates with</i>
<i>the most complex mental health needs</i>

38:58.002 --> 39:03.007
will be in great hands at a few select
federal psychiatric facilities,

39:03.090 --> 39:06.093
it will also give our inmates
with less severe issues

39:06.177 --> 39:10.598
a chance to integrate into gen pop
and, hopefully, society.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.516
So you're their advocate?

39:13.351 --> 39:14.977
I am trying to be.

39:15.061 --> 39:19.482
I'm trying to help these women
regain a sense of dignity.

39:19.857 --> 39:22.818
It's very important they see themselves
as more than inmates.

39:22.902 --> 39:28.407
They're someone's mother,
someone's daughter, sister, friend.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.952
And-- And people are interested in hearing
what is going to happen to them.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.413
Can you tell me more
about your integration plan?

39:34.997 --> 39:36.957
Right. Uh...

39:40.044 --> 39:42.630
You know, I'm glad you brought this up.

39:42.713 --> 39:46.759
This isn't about
hypothetical future plans,

39:46.842 --> 39:52.139
it's about the plans we have put in place
for our inmates currently.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.683
And I would love to talk to you more

39:54.767 --> 39:59.105
about the new rehabilitative programs
we've started.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.733
Studies have shown
that these give our inmates

40:02.817 --> 40:05.486
the best chance of success on the outside.

40:06.195 --> 40:09.907
Now, are these programs something
Psych inmates can integrate into?

40:10.449 --> 40:14.995
They should really have their own programs
specifically tailored to their needs.

40:15.287 --> 40:16.831
Which are?

40:18.457 --> 40:23.045
Uh, we're still looking into those,

40:23.462 --> 40:26.674
uh, dis-- discussing what's possible.

40:26.757 --> 40:29.427
Well, I'm sure whatever you come up with
will be amazing.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.388
Especially since you'll have
$2.5 million to spend a year.

40:34.056 --> 40:36.183
That's a specific number.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.937
It's what PolyCon is saving a year
by closing down the Psychiatric wing.

40:42.189 --> 40:44.942
Right, of course.

40:45.025 --> 40:47.445
Is that not what PolyCon is doing
with the money?

40:49.655 --> 40:50.781
It is.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.827
We're putting it back into the prison,

40:54.910 --> 40:58.372
and it will allow us to have

40:58.456 --> 41:04.378
an array of exciting motivational courses
available to all our inmates.

41:04.837 --> 41:08.007
And it will include the new programs

41:08.591 --> 41:14.013
and more guards specifically trained
for our neurodiverse inmates.

41:16.390 --> 41:18.017
<i>An inmate from Litchfield Federal Prison</i>

41:18.100 --> 41:19.852
<i>is attempting to contact you.</i>

41:19.935 --> 41:21.896
Accept. What up?

41:21.979 --> 41:25.858
Hey, girl!
Ooh, I was hoping you'd pick up first.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.193
How's school?

41:27.610 --> 41:29.653
<i></i>
-Yeah, girl.

41:30.112 --> 41:32.031
You girl <i>Well, all right, girl...</i>

41:34.116 --> 41:35.993
-Her.

41:37.244 --> 41:39.205
<i></i>
Give me the phone.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.041
You know he married an African princess
when he did the peace corps?

41:42.374 --> 41:46.253
Mr. Viktora died last year.
I think it was E. coli or something.

41:46.670 --> 41:49.340
-Or maybe he was old. I don't know.
-Give me the phone.

41:49.423 --> 41:51.008
-One second.
<i>Hmm.</i>

41:51.926 --> 41:54.762
Okay. But you still liking math?

41:54.845 --> 41:56.639
Since when are you interested in math?

41:56.722 --> 41:59.558
Since now. School's important.

41:59.642 --> 42:03.646
Boring. Look, I got some GloZell
to catch up on. Bye, girl.

42:03.729 --> 42:05.940
Wait. You still like watching
<i>Suite Life with Zack and Cody?</i>

42:06.232 --> 42:08.776
She stopped watching that a while ago.

42:10.444 --> 42:12.613
Hey, Ma. Um...

42:13.781 --> 42:15.491
You got time for me to read you something?

42:15.783 --> 42:18.160
I'm on my way out.
Can you read it to me next week?

42:18.244 --> 42:19.954
I won't be so crazy then.

42:20.037 --> 42:22.831
Well, next week I'm getting out.

42:29.255 --> 42:33.050
I'm sorry for everything
I've done to you, Ma.

42:33.551 --> 42:37.137
And-- And I know I got a long way to go
to get you to trust me again,

42:39.640 --> 42:43.227
but can I stay with you guys?

42:49.066 --> 42:52.903
If you were to live with us,
there'd have to be some rules.

42:53.487 --> 42:57.199
<i>This is a sensitive time in Monica's life</i>

42:57.283 --> 43:01.412
and I don't want you coming in here
all Hurricane Cindy like you do.

43:01.495 --> 43:04.373
Yes, of course. Of course, Ma.

43:04.456 --> 43:08.085
I will live by whatever rules
you need me to.

43:08.168 --> 43:10.921
-You won't get a pass this time.
-Understood.

43:13.048 --> 43:15.050
I'm trying to change, Ma.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.304
I want you to be proud of me.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.894
Well, we'll see how things go, then.

43:27.938 --> 43:30.816
Now, how do we come and get you?

43:36.905 --> 43:38.574
Come on! Come on! Come on!

44:03.432 --> 44:04.850
Don't make me laugh!

44:57.736 --> 44:59.363
You move like a snail.

44:59.446 --> 45:01.699
It is a miracle
we haven't been caught yet.

45:04.910 --> 45:06.537
I tried something new today.

45:08.747 --> 45:12.710
Is that mine? Are you fucking
single white female

45:13.127 --> 45:15.796
No, uh... Here. Touch.

45:21.510 --> 45:24.596
You have abs. Good for you.
Now, put that back where you found it.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.181
I wish I had abs.

45:26.265 --> 45:29.351
If I did, I'd enter a bikini contest
and win the prize money.

45:29.435 --> 45:33.480
These are chargers.
We can smuggle so many more in this way.

45:36.316 --> 45:37.443
Impressive.

45:39.111 --> 45:40.571
Will you help me take it off?

45:41.864 --> 45:42.823
I can't...

45:58.922 --> 46:00.382
Where in Texas are you from?

46:01.175 --> 46:03.051
Oh, that? No, um...

46:03.135 --> 46:05.846
When I was little,
we were studying Native Americans,

46:05.929 --> 46:10.350
and I learned that the Hasinai tribal word
<i>"texas"</i> means "Hello, friend."

46:10.434 --> 46:12.519
It just stuck with me.

46:12.853 --> 46:14.313
Couldn't have gone with <i>"aloha"?</i>

46:15.397 --> 46:16.356
Your turn.

46:17.232 --> 46:19.860
I think I can manage my own bustier.

46:19.943 --> 46:23.489
It's tricky with the chargers.
It'll be faster if I do it.

46:35.292 --> 46:37.336
At least my tattoo isn't a cliché.

46:37.419 --> 46:40.672
Fuck you. That's my lucky star.

46:41.006 --> 46:42.174
I'm sure it is.

46:54.978 --> 46:55.813
There.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.108
You're like a suicide bomber.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.612
I should get back.

47:07.115 --> 47:08.116
Bye.

47:19.461 --> 47:21.839
What's so important
you needed to tell me in person?

47:25.050 --> 47:26.134
I want to read you a letter.

47:26.718 --> 47:28.846
You know how hard it is
to find somebody on short notice

47:28.929 --> 47:30.180
to take care of Pepa? Next time, mail it to me.

47:33.016 --> 47:34.351
This isn't easy for me, all right?

47:34.434 --> 47:36.812
So just let me read it
before I change my mind.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.869
"I want to apologize for a lot of things.

47:54.246 --> 47:56.874
I'm sorry I didn't trust
how you were raising Pepa.

47:58.667 --> 48:01.128
You're the one out there
with her every day.

48:02.337 --> 48:05.090
The one who picked up the pieces
when I fucked up.

48:07.426 --> 48:10.596
I made a lot of bad choices
the past few years,

48:10.679 --> 48:15.267
but the one thing I did right
was choosing you to be Pepa's daddy.

48:21.815 --> 48:24.526
I understand you got to move on
with your life.

48:26.278 --> 48:27.988
I've held you back long enough.

48:28.989 --> 48:31.199
What I'm trying to say is,

48:31.283 --> 48:34.453
I want what's good for you,
'cause that's what's good for Pepa."

48:39.708 --> 48:40.918
Thank you.  I'm not done.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.757
I'm trusting you out there with her.

48:48.050 --> 48:51.386
So I need you to trust me
in here with her.

48:52.471 --> 48:54.431
I want you to start bringing her again.

48:55.474 --> 48:57.017
She should know who her mommy is.

48:57.100 --> 48:59.686
You know I don't want her thinking
this place is an option for her.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.688
Believe me, you bring her here

49:01.772 --> 49:03.941
and I'll show her
how this is not an option.

49:05.484 --> 49:07.027
She's gonna ask about me.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.405
So it's better to be ahead of it.

49:11.823 --> 49:12.824
Okay.

49:14.201 --> 49:17.579
But if she starts going down
the wrong road, we stop coming.

49:18.497 --> 49:20.457
We'll make those decisions together.

49:24.127 --> 49:25.379
I can do that.

49:31.385 --> 49:32.427
One more thing.

49:33.261 --> 49:36.640
I want to meet this new woman
that Pepa's spending her time with.

49:40.018 --> 49:41.019
What's her name?

49:43.522 --> 49:44.898
Her name's Maria. Are you fuckin' kidding me?

49:47.442 --> 49:50.654
Oh, fuck you, you fucking pussy.

49:50.737 --> 49:52.322
Who got voted off the island?

49:53.657 --> 49:58.495
Litvack denied my Imam request in an email
while I'm out of the office.

49:58.578 --> 49:59.579
Fucking coward.

49:59.663 --> 50:02.374
He says, and I quote,
"We can't have women congregating

50:02.457 --> 50:04.751
and speaking in foreign languages."

50:05.127 --> 50:07.504
Those guys keep things
as hellish as possible

50:07.587 --> 50:10.549
so those women beg to be deported.

50:10.632 --> 50:13.969
I'm just another cog
in their shit machine.

50:14.720 --> 50:17.597
Well, maybe it's time to take a step back.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.391
Reassess what you want.

50:20.892 --> 50:23.854
I've been much happier
since someone very wise

50:23.937 --> 50:27.190
told me I could make more of a difference
outside the system.

50:27.274 --> 50:29.818
Refer to me as sexy, not wise.

50:29.901 --> 50:32.446
And, unlike you, I have no illusions
of making a difference.

50:32.529 --> 50:35.323
Now, be quiet,
so I can start watching episode 38.

50:35.699 --> 50:36.825
Time to go!

50:38.243 --> 50:40.871
All right. Let's wake up the troops!

50:44.207 --> 50:48.754
Did you post something
about my surgery on Facebook?

50:48.837 --> 50:52.257
According to Facebook,
I'm still happily married, so, no.

50:52.340 --> 50:56.094
Also, I haven't logged in
since the Russians took over.

50:57.054 --> 50:59.347
I'm getting a lot of love and support.

50:59.431 --> 51:00.265
Excuse me.

51:01.975 --> 51:03.977
-That's weird.

51:35.634 --> 51:37.511
Mrs. Caputo, this is where we leave you.

51:37.594 --> 51:39.888
As if I would ever take your name.
Come.

51:40.889 --> 51:43.892
-Give me a second. Just a minute.
-Stop stalling! Come on! The sooner we do this,
the sooner we get to babymaking.

51:55.362 --> 51:57.239
Be nice to the nice nurse.

52:02.327 --> 52:05.038
Hayes... Ugh. You ready?

52:09.334 --> 52:12.587
Well, it's been interesting
living with you.

52:13.421 --> 52:14.840
You leaving your stuff here?

52:15.215 --> 52:18.593
Yeah. I don't want to take this place
with me.

52:19.344 --> 52:22.180
Well, what am I supposed to do
with all that junk?

52:23.890 --> 52:27.853
Well, good luck to you.
Hope I never see you again.

52:33.859 --> 52:35.569
Hold up. Can you give me a minute?

52:36.403 --> 52:39.322
You wanna stay in prison longer?
Knock yourself out.

52:42.367 --> 52:43.368
Oh!

52:46.163 --> 52:49.416
"Slams the body down."

52:57.757 --> 53:02.095
Uh... this is like Christmas gifts
and hide-and-seek

53:02.179 --> 53:05.182
and cooking soufflés and bathroom stalls.
No peeking.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.687
I'm gonna miss you, Suzanne.  Oh.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.402
I'm gonna miss you, too.

53:18.945 --> 53:19.946
Mmm.

53:21.656 --> 53:22.574
Wait.

53:24.784 --> 53:28.914
-I'm leaving. Like leaving-leaving.

53:30.624 --> 53:31.666
No.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.712
No, no, no.

53:35.795 --> 53:39.257
You-- You-- You can't go. You can't go.

53:39.341 --> 53:41.968
I'm not done writing.

53:42.052 --> 53:48.350
I mean, does canceled have one "L" or two?
And is it "affect" or "effect"?

53:48.433 --> 53:52.187
There's so many questions
and so little time to fix you and Taystee!

53:52.270 --> 53:53.521
You can't...

54:02.155 --> 54:03.406
Thank you.

54:08.161 --> 54:12.040
Thank you for always trying
to make things better.

54:13.583 --> 54:15.794
I got a lot to learn from you.

54:20.674 --> 54:22.592
I'm gonna write you letters.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.934
I'mma call you to see how you're doing.

54:36.064 --> 54:37.107
"See"?

54:39.901 --> 54:41.820
But I won't see what you're doing.

54:43.238 --> 54:45.865
'Cause it's a phone.

54:52.372 --> 54:54.374
Oh. Oh.

54:59.421 --> 55:01.881
Will you send me pictures
of you doing fun stuff?

55:01.965 --> 55:06.136
Like riding a bicycle, or...
Do you ride bicycles?

55:06.219 --> 55:07.137
Yes.

55:08.638 --> 55:10.557
Or ice-skating when it's cold.

55:10.640 --> 55:14.811
Or roller-skating when it's hot.
General movement with wheels.

55:15.270 --> 55:16.563
Oh, except for scooters.

55:16.646 --> 55:20.233
'Cause my dad says adults on scooters
look like idiots.

55:21.943 --> 55:26.156
But secretly,
I think they look kind of fun.

55:41.921 --> 55:44.799
-I heard Cindy got out today.
-I know.

55:46.176 --> 55:48.595
And you're okay with her
walking out there free like that?

55:50.055 --> 55:52.682
You shoulda let me messed up her face
when we had the chance.

55:52.766 --> 55:56.436
I thought about that.
But I'm pretty confident her life

55:56.519 --> 55:59.397
is gonna be what she deserves
on the outside.
