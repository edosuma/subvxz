00:20.145 --> 00:22.523
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

00:22.606 --> 00:24.942
<i>Just like the way Doug unplugs</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:31.782
So, Doug, if this is a robot dock, does that mean there are robot boats?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.033
There sure are.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.327
We call 'em ro-boats.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.705
Hi there, Doug. Hi, Emma.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.874
Hi, Jenny. What are you doing out here?

00:40.958 --> 00:42.501
Oh, nothing much, Doug-o.

00:42.584 --> 00:46.547
Just taking a nice aerial stroll with my beloved Teddy-Bot.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.674
Your beloved what-ty bot?

00:48.757 --> 00:51.301
My Teddy-Bot. Had him since I was a little drone.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.096
He's officially cuddly, the perfect power down partner.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.557
You can even boop his nose and it goes…

00:57.140 --> 01:02.563
Oh, my gosh! A robot teddy bear, complete with a boopy nose.

01:02.646 --> 01:06.859
I somersault in cuteness overload!

01:06.942 --> 01:10.529
Or… I would if I wasn't on this dock.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.739
Teddy-Bot and I love flying together.

01:12.823 --> 01:15.617
In fact, he was there for my first takeoff.

01:15.701 --> 01:20.122
It was a windy day much like this, and we soared up into the sky and--

01:21.164 --> 01:22.165
Wind current!

01:24.585 --> 01:26.879
The wind is so strong.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.047
No!

01:29.798 --> 01:31.675
Teddy-Bot!

01:32.885 --> 01:34.469
No, no, no.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.931
No!

01:38.515 --> 01:40.893
Teddy-Bot fell in the water. We gotta get him back.

01:40.976 --> 01:45.689
Yeah, but how, Doug? That water looks deep. Like, really deep.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.274
So, what's the problem?

01:47.357 --> 01:48.442
-Diverbot! -Diverbot!

01:48.525 --> 01:51.195
Hey, Dougster! Hey, Jenster.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.239
Hey, human-I-don't-know-ster.

01:54.323 --> 01:57.034
Diverbot, meet my best friend, Emma.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.493
Emma, meet Diverbot.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.787
He goes deep down in the ocean all the time,

02:00.871 --> 02:02.497
cleaning up trash for rebooting.

02:02.581 --> 02:03.916
Nice to meet you, Emma.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.877
I can't believe it. It's a talking submarine.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.586
I'm a talking what now?

02:08.669 --> 02:10.088
I'm not sure.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.549
I've never heard the word "submarine" before.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.927
I'll plug in and find out what it means.

02:17.679 --> 02:21.308
<i>In the ocean underwater In a submarine</i>

02:22.017 --> 02:25.687
<i>Unlike a boat, it fills with water The pressure helps it sink</i>

02:25.771 --> 02:28.357
<i>Going deep, deep Going deeper, yeah</i>

02:28.440 --> 02:30.484
<i>Deep, deep Going deeper</i>

02:30.567 --> 02:35.072
<i>Propeller movin' forward Rudder side to side</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:39.701
<i>Fins go up and down Tanks fill with air to rise</i>

02:39.785 --> 02:44.623
<i>Uwa uwa uwa underwater, underwater</i>

02:44.706 --> 02:48.752
<i>Uwa uwa uwa underwater, underwater</i>

02:48.836 --> 02:50.629
<i>In a submarine</i>

02:51.380 --> 02:54.174
<i>Yeah we can see, under the sea</i>

02:55.425 --> 02:57.261
<i>In a submarine</i>

02:58.804 --> 02:59.972
I get it.

03:00.055 --> 03:04.309
Submarines are vehicles like Diverbot that travel deep in the ocean.

03:04.393 --> 03:08.605
But I have a big question. What can you discover in the ocean?

03:08.689 --> 03:11.316
Well, I hope we discover Teddy-Bot.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.193
Can you help us find him, Diverbot?

03:13.277 --> 03:14.653
Of course I can.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.448
Hop on in, and we'll robo-go with the robo-flow.

03:18.991 --> 03:23.579
I can't believe it. I'm riding in a talking submarine.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.998
Time to head down and rescue Teddy-Bot.

03:26.081 --> 03:29.251
Buckle up, everybotty. This is gonna be epic.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.752
Yeah!

03:39.720 --> 03:44.558
It's so, so, so wow.

03:44.641 --> 03:48.187
Couldn't have said it better myself, my shiny friend.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.856
All right, Jenster, like, where to?

03:50.939 --> 03:52.316
Well, let's see.

03:52.399 --> 03:56.195
I think I dropped Teddy-Bot somewhere that way.

03:56.278 --> 03:59.865
Then that way we go. Full steam ahead.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.452
Hey, look over there. Is that Teddy-Bot?

04:03.535 --> 04:07.080
Nope. It's dolphin ahoy, Doug.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.207
A dolphin?

04:08.290 --> 04:11.293
They're super smart animals who makes sounds like this:

04:13.420 --> 04:15.130
And they love to play.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.345
See? Patty-cake, patty-cake with a porpoise.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.598
Emma! Please stop patty-caking with that dolphin

04:24.681 --> 04:26.892
and ask her if she's seen my Teddy-Bot.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.728
Sure thing. Have you seen Teddy-Bot?

04:32.523 --> 04:33.774
I said…

04:38.028 --> 04:39.905
Why is she not answering me?

04:39.988 --> 04:41.156
Because you just said,

04:41.240 --> 04:44.868
"Banana peel, banana peel, picture frame. My uncle's name is Chase."

04:46.787 --> 04:48.455
Guess you don't speak dolphin, Emma.

04:48.539 --> 04:52.501
Well, fortunately, I do. Dolphin's part of my programming.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.419
Here, I'll see what she knows.

04:58.841 --> 05:01.635
Really? You did? Okay.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.387
What'd she say?

05:03.470 --> 05:07.891
She said she saw something that looks just like Teddy-Bot.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.270
-And she'll lead us to him. -Thank you, thank you, thank you.

05:11.353 --> 05:14.982
Okay, dudes, enough cheering and hold on. That dolphin's fast.

05:24.658 --> 05:28.161
-What's that? -That is a coral reef.

05:28.245 --> 05:32.165
It's a special place in the ocean, full of all kinds of sea buddies.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.961
Wow. I've never seen so many fish before.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.297
Do they all live in the coral reef?

05:38.380 --> 05:42.342
Oh, yeah. It's like a fish party in there. Check 'em out.

05:42.426 --> 05:45.262
Those ones are angelfish. Good guys.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.055
And that one?

05:47.139 --> 05:50.184
She's a clown fish. Always the life of the party.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.351
And that one?

05:51.435 --> 05:54.104
That's Tim. Hey, Tim Fish.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.689
How's it going, buddy?

05:55.772 --> 05:58.984
Hey, Tim Fish. Have you seen Teddy-Bot?

05:59.943 --> 06:02.905
Wait. Jenny, look. He's over there.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.115
Full steam ahead, Diverbot.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.661
Uh-oh. What happened to Teddy-Bot?

06:09.745 --> 06:11.496
What's happening to us?

06:11.580 --> 06:12.664
Hold on, buddies.

06:12.748 --> 06:16.126
-We're caught in a gnarly current. -You mean like a wind current?

06:16.210 --> 06:19.546
Yep. Only this ocean one's made of swift-moving water.

06:20.130 --> 06:24.885
Hold on, dudes. Just relax and robo-go with the robo-flow.

06:26.845 --> 06:27.971
Much better.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.765
-Everyone okay? -We're okay.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.225
-You bot. -Sure are.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.392
All right.

06:32.476 --> 06:35.437
Let's get this Teddy-Bot search on the-- Uh-oh.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.357
Oh, no!

06:38.440 --> 06:39.775
What's wrong, Diverbot?

06:39.858 --> 06:41.443
My propeller's stuck.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.446
Sorry, but without my propeller, we can't move forward.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.199
Oh, no. What are we gonna do now?

06:47.282 --> 06:50.035
Maybe we can find a way to fix Diverbot.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.787
Yeah. Don't give up, Jenny.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.163
Good idea, guys.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.333
Let's surface and see what we can do. Going up.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.587
Okay, we're back on the shore.

07:00.671 --> 07:04.258
There must be something here that can help fix Diverbot's propellers.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.885
Quick, everybotty. Spread out!

07:06.969 --> 07:09.680
Look at all these seashells.

07:10.264 --> 07:13.976
They won't help fix Diverbot, but…

07:14.059 --> 07:15.811
they are really pretty.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.564
I found these big leaves under the palm trees.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.274
Maybe they can help us.

07:20.357 --> 07:24.945
Hey, what's this big green thing laying on the beach?

07:25.028 --> 07:29.491
Jenny, that big green thing is a sea turtle.

07:29.575 --> 07:33.161
Wow, those are some interesting feet. What kind of shoes do you wear?

07:33.245 --> 07:34.872
Doug!

07:34.955 --> 07:36.915
Doug, Doug, Doug.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.877
Those aren't feet. They're flippers.

07:39.960 --> 07:44.089
Turtles use them to help them move around in the sand and in the water.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.091
Wait a nanosecond.

07:46.175 --> 07:49.219
These leaves sort of look like those turtle's flippers.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.805
We could reboot them into flippers for Diverbot.

07:52.306 --> 07:56.518
Doug, you beautiful bot. You're a robo-genius.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.687
All right, all right.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.815
Thanks to these flippers, we're full steam ahead again.

08:01.899 --> 08:04.276
Let's robo-go with the robo-flow.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.904
-We're coming, Teddy-Bot. -Yeah!

08:08.822 --> 08:09.990
There. Look.

08:10.574 --> 08:15.871
Hey, it's our dolphin friend, with all of her dolphin friends.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.165
And look what they're passing around.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.291
Teddy-Bot!

08:20.918 --> 08:23.795
Looks like those dolphins think she's awesome, just like you do.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.756
Told you they were playful.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.219
I got ya, Teddy-Bot.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.056
-No! -Oh, no! Another gnarly current.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.933
-Teddy-Bot! -Come back!

08:37.267 --> 08:38.268
Bummer.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.606
Hang on. Check out this awesome move.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.485
Come on. Almost got ya.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.947
Nope. Still a bummer.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.366
Sorry, Jenster, no can reach.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.410
Well, thanks for trying, everyone.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.997
If you need me, I'll just be staring at this wall.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.083
I can't believe it.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.377
We came all the way down here to find him

09:03.460 --> 09:06.129
and got whooshed around in the current, and now we can't--

09:06.213 --> 09:08.382
Wait! Hold your microchips.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.801
Emma, the current. That's it!

09:10.884 --> 09:14.179
If the flow of the water pushed Teddy-Bot out into the ocean,

09:14.263 --> 09:16.765
maybe it could push him out of those rocks.

09:16.849 --> 09:19.059
Only, how can we control the current?

09:19.142 --> 09:23.021
Leave it to me, Dougster, and my new fins.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.941
Come on, little dude.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.986
Robo-go with the robo-flow!

09:31.071 --> 09:34.950
It's working! Teddy-Bot's starting to move.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.577
Keep going, Diverbot!

09:42.249 --> 09:43.250
Yeah!

09:43.917 --> 09:45.294
Yes!

09:45.377 --> 09:48.463
-We got him. -All right. Yeah, Teddy-Bot!

09:48.547 --> 09:49.882
Oh, yes!

09:50.465 --> 09:53.093
Hi there, my little cuddle botty.

09:53.177 --> 09:56.638
I'm so glad you're back. Give me a boop. Come here.

09:57.222 --> 10:00.392
Thanks so much, my underwater copilots.

10:00.475 --> 10:03.979
You know, I couldn't have gotten Teddy-Bot back without you and Diverbot.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.689
You're welcome, Jenster.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.984
It's been a real underwater rescue adventure.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.068
It sure has.

10:10.152 --> 10:14.323
And we learned all kinds of things, like how playful dolphins are.

10:14.406 --> 10:18.619
And that coral reefs are home to all sorts of fish.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.746
Hi, Tim. Bye, Tim.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.749
And how these awesome palm leaves we found on land

10:23.832 --> 10:26.001
could be like turtle flippers in the ocean.

10:26.084 --> 10:29.796
The ocean is full of life and has so much to show us.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.674
And that's why you explore it.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.843
I learned the answer to my question!

10:34.927 --> 10:36.845
Epic learning, Dougster.

10:36.929 --> 10:38.847
-Yes! -Yay!

10:38.931 --> 10:39.932
Awesome!

10:42.142 --> 10:44.353
Catch you later, friendsters.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.313
Bye, Diverbot.

10:47.272 --> 10:51.485
I think my little copilot has had enough adventure for one day.

10:51.568 --> 10:55.155
I'm gonna get him back to Rebots safe and sound.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.408
-Wow! -Oh, no!

10:58.492 --> 11:00.869
Jenny's caught in the wind current again.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.830
Jenny, hold on to Teddy-Bot!

11:06.083 --> 11:07.167
I have an idea.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.753
Jenny! Remember the current in the water?

11:09.837 --> 11:14.591
Just relax and robo-go with the robo-flow.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.010
I get it.

11:17.094 --> 11:19.596
Hey, hey!

11:20.806 --> 11:24.810
See you dudes back at Rebots.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.988
Explorer Emma,

11:36.071 --> 11:40.033
are you ready to journey into the strange and mysterious land of…

11:40.117 --> 11:42.077
the hall closet?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.288
-Ready, explorer Dad. -Remember,

11:44.371 --> 11:47.040
our mission is to put everything we don't need anymore

11:47.124 --> 11:50.127
into this reboot bin and then escape.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.337
-Charge! -Charge!

12:02.556 --> 12:05.350
There is a lot of stuff to clean out.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.937
Well then, let's get started.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.524
I don't need these clown shoes anymore. Come to think of it,

12:12.608 --> 12:14.651
why did I ever need clown shoes?

12:15.319 --> 12:17.654
Once the bin's full, we'll take it to the curb.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.909
Then Rebots can collect all our old things and turn them into useful items.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.286
What's this?

12:25.204 --> 12:26.663
I've been looking for that.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.920
It's an album full of pictures of you when you were a baby.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.964
I was really cute back then too.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.592
Yes, you were.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.135
We have to save this.

12:42.054 --> 12:44.806
I see something else we definitely don't need.

12:45.307 --> 12:48.769
Why I have this, no one knows.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.437
Classic.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.446
And the bin's full already.

12:59.530 --> 13:01.949
Let's take it out to the curb for Rebots to pick up.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.451
There.

13:05.077 --> 13:08.372
Now why don't we go back inside and look at that photo album?

13:08.455 --> 13:10.457
-Charge! -Charge!

13:11.333 --> 13:12.793
Look at that.

13:12.876 --> 13:17.089
If there's one thing the Jenster loves more than spotting a full reboot bin,

13:17.673 --> 13:21.051
it's the Jenster flying that bin back to Rebots.

13:22.469 --> 13:26.098
Come on. There's even a photo of the first time you saw a platypus.

13:28.225 --> 13:31.895
Wait. The album-- I was sure I put it right here.

13:32.771 --> 13:37.442
Uh-oh. The recycling bin was below it, so what if--

13:37.734 --> 13:39.236
-It fell in! -It fell in!

13:39.903 --> 13:42.948
Oh, no. No, no, no!

13:43.031 --> 13:46.827
The bin got picked up already. It must be on its way to Rebots.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.495
To Rebots!

13:48.871 --> 13:49.997
-Charge! -Charge!

13:54.084 --> 13:56.295
Coming in with a full bin.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.547
Wow! Whoops.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.924
Well, it was full. Sorry, Doug.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.261
Wonder what this is.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.055
This thing looks sort of familiar.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.891
Scanning database…

14:11.143 --> 14:15.063
It's called a photo album. But I've never seen one in a reboot bin.

14:15.147 --> 14:16.857
I've never even heard of one.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.526
Time to plug in and find out what they are.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.698
<i>When you snap a picture Print and put it in a book</i>

14:25.199 --> 14:28.827
<i>It's called a photo album Made for when you wanna look</i>

14:29.661 --> 14:31.538
<i>Back at first times</i>

14:31.622 --> 14:33.749
<i>Happy goodbyes</i>

14:34.333 --> 14:38.504
<i>And new friends Fun weekends, vacations</i>

14:39.254 --> 14:41.215
<i>Put a picture in it Put a picture in it</i>

14:41.298 --> 14:43.091
<i>Yah yah yahh</i>

14:43.175 --> 14:45.052
<i>Put a picture in it Put a picture in it</i>

14:45.135 --> 14:46.720
<i>Yah yahh</i>

14:46.803 --> 14:48.597
<i>Sport tickets, news clippings</i>

14:48.680 --> 14:50.641
<i>Fun stickers and colorings</i>

14:50.724 --> 14:53.435
<i>You could print things Or go wild with tape</i>

14:53.519 --> 14:56.355
<i>One, two, three, cheese!</i>

14:57.064 --> 14:58.440
I see.

14:58.524 --> 15:03.028
A photo album is a bunch of photographs kept together in a book.

15:03.111 --> 15:07.074
But I still have a big question. Why do humans make photo albums?

15:07.157 --> 15:09.743
Well, this one must belong to someone.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.829
If we find the owner, then you can ask them your question.

15:13.914 --> 15:17.709
Hey. This same little girl is in all the photos.

15:17.793 --> 15:21.463
She looks like a smaller model. She must be a junior human.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.049
The photo album must belong to her.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.928
Look. She's at the beach. Maybe she's there now.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.889
Quick, let's go there and give this back to her.

15:32.891 --> 15:36.854
Palm trees, volleyball court. I think it's the same spot.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.314
But there's only one way to find out.

15:39.398 --> 15:40.816
I'll take a picture of you here

15:40.899 --> 15:43.652
and see if the background matches the one in the photo album.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.946
That way, we'll know we're in the right place.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.282
Okay, smile like the junior human, Doug.

15:48.782 --> 15:52.786
Okay. Chee-- Wait. I have another question.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.708
Why do humans say "Cheese!" before they get their picture taken?

15:57.791 --> 16:00.502
Oh, Dougster. That's simple.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.922
It's because getting their photo taken makes them really hungry.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.382
That makes total sense.

16:06.925 --> 16:11.013
So I'll say another food, like "Applesauce!"

16:12.848 --> 16:13.932
It's a match.

16:15.184 --> 16:17.269
Let's look for the junior human in the picture.

16:17.352 --> 16:21.940
She has a floppy hat on her head, so look for a hat that flops.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.903
Doug, I see the floppy headed junior human.

16:25.986 --> 16:26.987
Over there.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.619
Hello, junior human. Did you by any chance drop this?

16:34.328 --> 16:37.748
Wait. There's a rabbit on that floppy hat, not ducks.

16:38.916 --> 16:40.334
Wrong junior human.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.837
Maybe the one we're looking for isn't at the beach after all.

16:43.921 --> 16:48.091
Look. In this picture, she's at the Mega City library.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.384
Let's check there.

16:52.137 --> 16:56.183
Okay. Our photo album has to be here somewhere.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.935
Let's ask Bob Bot.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.312
Hello, Laurence. Hello, Emma.

17:00.395 --> 17:03.649
Those are some strange-looking smiles.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.233
Why are they upside down?

17:05.317 --> 17:08.694
They're not smiles, Mr. Bot. We're worried.

17:08.779 --> 17:12.532
Our photo album accidentally ended up in our recycling bin and got taken here.

17:12.616 --> 17:13.617
Have you seen it?

17:14.201 --> 17:17.079
Well, we finished rebooting our morning shipment,

17:17.162 --> 17:19.373
and I don't recall seeing a photo album.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.584
Oh, no. It's already been rebooted.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.877
We'll never get it back now.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.214
Don't give up, explorer Emma.

17:27.297 --> 17:30.717
Maybe the album is back home and we just missed it.

17:30.801 --> 17:33.762
Well, there's only one way to find out.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.515
There's a right-side-up smile.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.100
-Charge! -Charge!

17:38.892 --> 17:40.644
Broccolini!

17:42.104 --> 17:45.023
It's a match. I hope she's here somewhere.

17:48.527 --> 17:49.945
Book.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.197
Book, book, book, book. Book, book, book.

17:52.281 --> 17:53.323
Book, book, book.

17:53.407 --> 17:55.742
You seeing what I'm seeing, Doug-o?

17:55.826 --> 17:57.619
-A lot of jam? -A lot of jam.

17:57.703 --> 18:00.163
We can't let those jammy hands near this album.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.207
Now quick, let's keep looking for that girl.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.334
She's not over here.

18:04.877 --> 18:05.878
Book, book, book.

18:06.753 --> 18:07.963
Or here either.

18:09.423 --> 18:10.716
Book, book, book, book.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.555
I'm not seeing anyone who looks like her.

18:16.638 --> 18:17.973
Let's check the album.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.976
Wait a nanosecond. Where is the photo album?

18:24.021 --> 18:25.439
Book, book, book.

18:25.522 --> 18:28.400
Quick! You distract him, Doug-o, and I'll get the album.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.568
Book, book, book.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.535
Got it. Let's get outta here.

18:43.457 --> 18:45.042
Book.

18:45.626 --> 18:48.504
So this girl's not here in the library either.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.047
Where else can we look?

18:51.715 --> 18:52.925
-The park! -The park!

18:53.509 --> 18:55.344
Potatoes!

18:56.720 --> 18:58.096
This is the right spot.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.392
-And look at that red shirt. -It's her!

19:02.476 --> 19:04.353
Follow that bike.

19:05.938 --> 19:09.024
Oh, yeah. No one's faster than the Jenster.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.984
Look out. Another one?

19:11.735 --> 19:14.071
What is this, the Mega City kite club?

19:14.154 --> 19:17.824
Let the meeting of the Mega City kite club commence.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.370
Forgot it was Tuesday.

19:21.453 --> 19:24.039
Doug, the bike is about to leave the park!

19:24.748 --> 19:27.292
I see it. Turbo time.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.545
Coming through.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.339
Excuse me.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.676
Stop, please. I have great news.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.470
I think I found your--

19:39.304 --> 19:41.056
And… wrong kid.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.266
Never mind.

19:44.935 --> 19:45.936
Not a match?

19:46.854 --> 19:47.938
Not a match.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.942
If we don't find the owner, they won't get their photo album back.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.778
And I'll never get to learn why humans make them.

19:55.529 --> 19:57.739
There must be something we've missed.

19:58.574 --> 20:00.868
Jenny, look. The house in this picture.

20:00.951 --> 20:03.704
It's right here. Test picture time.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.665
Say "Rutabagas!"

20:07.374 --> 20:08.375
Rutabaga.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.920
Right you are, Doug. It's a match.

20:12.004 --> 20:14.214
But-- Wait a nanosecond.

20:14.298 --> 20:15.841
This is Emma's house.

20:15.924 --> 20:19.094
How could this baby girl live there?

20:19.595 --> 20:21.471
Doug. Jenny.

20:21.555 --> 20:24.308
I saw you out here taking a picture of my house.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.436
Hey, take my picture. Cheese!

20:28.228 --> 20:29.771
Wait another nanosecond.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.441
Emma is smiling just like the baby in the picture.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.069
-That's you. -That's me.

20:36.153 --> 20:39.406
I'm confused. Did someone use a shrink ray on you, Emma,

20:39.489 --> 20:42.075
then take your picture, then make you big again?

20:42.618 --> 20:46.955
No. That's me when I was a baby. This is my baby photo album.

20:47.497 --> 20:50.501
We've been looking for that everywhere.

20:52.294 --> 20:56.173
Daddy, Dad! Doug and Jenny found our photo album.

20:57.090 --> 21:00.093
They have? Bravo, bots.

21:00.177 --> 21:02.471
It was in a recycle bin at Rebots.

21:02.554 --> 21:06.266
Jenny never saw one in a bin before, so we thought it was a mistake.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.685
It was a mistake all right.

21:08.769 --> 21:11.396
This photo album is very special.

21:11.480 --> 21:15.108
Thank you so, so much for bringing it back.

21:16.151 --> 21:19.363
Look, this is the first time we took Emma to the library.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.198
What's she doing with that book?

21:21.281 --> 21:22.533
Trying to eat it.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.451
Classic.

21:25.369 --> 21:29.540
And this was the first sandcastle you ever made at the beach.

21:29.623 --> 21:33.335
Even back then I was good.

21:34.711 --> 21:38.006
And this was the first time we took Emma to the park.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.509
Look at all the dogs.

21:41.009 --> 21:44.388
I giggled so much. That's why we got Princess Woofingham.

21:45.597 --> 21:49.226
Wow. I think I finally learned why humans make photo albums:

21:49.309 --> 21:52.646
to remember special moments and how they made them feel.

21:52.729 --> 21:56.400
Right you are, Doug. There's a lot of love in this photo album.

21:58.151 --> 22:02.823
If I could cry tears of joy, I would totally be doing that right now.

22:02.906 --> 22:04.783
You know, looking through it,

22:04.867 --> 22:07.327
there's just one thing this album's missing.

22:07.411 --> 22:08.370
What's that, Emma?

22:08.453 --> 22:11.206
A picture of my best bot who found it.

22:11.290 --> 22:12.416
You too, Jenny.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.753
Cantaloupe. Brussels sprouts.

22:16.837 --> 22:17.838
Tomato sauce.

22:18.463 --> 22:19.882
Wait. Let's try…

22:19.965 --> 22:21.425
-Cheese! -Chee--

22:21.508 --> 22:24.469
Jenny, I think I know why humans say cheese

22:24.553 --> 22:26.388
before they get their picture taken.

22:26.471 --> 22:27.890
'Cause it makes you smile.

22:27.973 --> 22:29.391
-Cheese! -Cheese!

22:30.767 --> 22:34.188
Nothing cheesy about that. It's perfect.

22:39.026 --> 22:41.195
<i>Yah yah yahh</i>

22:43.197 --> 22:44.489
<i>Yah yahh</i>

22:44.990 --> 22:47.201
<i>Put a picture in it Put a picture in it</i>

22:47.284 --> 22:49.161
<i>Yah yah yahh</i>

22:49.244 --> 22:51.205
<i>Put a picture in it Put a picture in it</i>

22:51.288 --> 22:52.289
<i>Yah yahh</i>

22:52.372 --> 22:54.583
<i>Sport tickets, news clippings</i>

22:54.666 --> 22:56.418
<i>Fun stickers and colorings</i>

22:56.502 --> 22:59.213
<i>You could print things Or go wild with tape</i>

22:59.296 --> 23:02.007
<i>One, two, three, cheese!</i>
