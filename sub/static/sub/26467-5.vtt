WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:03.795
<i>My name is Barry Allen</i>

00:03.880 --> 00:06.236
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.320 --> 00:09.199
<i>To the outside world I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:12.313
<i>But secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:15.154
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.240 --> 00:17.550
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.871
<i>she changed the present,</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>and now our world
is more dangerous than ever,</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.995
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:25.080 --> 00:27.072
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:29.953
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.200 --> 00:32.270
Ah!

00:32.360 --> 00:33.794
<i>What is that?</i>

00:33.880 --> 00:36.793
<i>It's a game my dad
and I used to play.</i>

00:36.880 --> 00:39.475
<i>It's a letter from my dad.
He's still alive.</i>

00:39.600 --> 00:41.956
You put a power dampening
chip inside me

00:42.040 --> 00:43.235
to take away my speed.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.616
Is that why
you've been so cold to me?

00:44.640 --> 00:46.216
Why you don't want to spend
any time with me?

00:46.240 --> 00:48.197
<i>Mom thinks
that she had good reason</i>

00:48.280 --> 00:50.397
to suppress my powers
in the future.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.039
I support her decisions.

00:56.360 --> 01:00.354
Let's just call it, Barry.
She's not coming. Again.

01:00.440 --> 01:03.512
She's probably
just helping with Jenna

01:03.600 --> 01:05.159
so Joe
and Cecile can sleep in.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.357
Every day
for the past two weeks?

01:07.440 --> 01:09.955
They look really tired.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.117
They do.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.112
<i>Tripped alarm
at Central City Art Gallery.</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:18.876
- Someone stole a Monet.
- At 10:00 a.m.? That's bold.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.953
CCPD's en route,
suspect heading west on Ruger.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.296
<i>The thiefjust turned
on to Ramirez off of Fifth.</i>

01:55.320 --> 01:56.674
<i>Almost there.</i>

02:17.160 --> 02:18.435
He's not carrying anything.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.136
<i>Because he handed it off
to someone else.</i>

02:20.160 --> 02:21.276
- Nora?
- Nora?

02:21.360 --> 02:23.040
- Uh, where's he headed?
<i>- I got him.</i>

02:23.160 --> 02:24.594
<i>I can stop someone
on a motorcycle.</i>

02:24.680 --> 02:26.433
No, Nora,
let Barry help, okay...

02:28.080 --> 02:30.197
I know you did not just
cut me off from this thing.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.236
Gotcha.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.753
Are you okay?

02:50.440 --> 02:52.875
This is why we train, Nora.
Every single day.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.896
Not when you feel like it,
not because you're mad,

02:54.920 --> 02:56.798
and why you
always have someone in your ear

02:56.880 --> 02:58.320
when you're in the field
to help you.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.556
- I know that.
- Then why did you turn me off?

03:00.640 --> 03:03.030
Because I can't
listen to you anymore.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.640
It's always
the same condescending,

03:04.720 --> 03:06.518
I-know-better-than-you crap.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.751
I just want to be me
and you sit behind your desk

03:08.840 --> 03:10.069
and you say "no"
every time

03:10.160 --> 03:12.296
and I've been hearing it my
whole life and I'm sick of it.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.118
- Your whole life?
- Yes, Mom.

03:14.200 --> 03:18.080
Since I can remember,
and you never change.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.557
Iris.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.838
You know, Nora, I wish you
would try to understand

03:33.920 --> 03:36.480
who your mom is today,

03:36.560 --> 03:39.632
and stop seeing her as who she
becomes in the future.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.751
- That's for you.
- The hell is this?

03:50.840 --> 03:52.720
Well, that's the hours
to apply against my debt.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.190
Fruitful hours spent getting
closer to uncovering

03:55.280 --> 03:58.000
the identity of your
serial meta-killer, Cicada.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.080
And how's that?

03:59.120 --> 04:01.237
Well, I apply a complex
formula... complex for you,

04:01.320 --> 04:04.040
involving the terminal
velocity and the weight

04:04.120 --> 04:05.536
of the S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite
and the velocity of Barry

04:05.560 --> 04:07.677
and Nora traveling
when they...

04:07.760 --> 04:13.791
destroy the satellite, right,
allowing me to conclude that...

04:15.200 --> 04:17.555
The debris from the satellite,
the satellite shrapnel,

04:17.640 --> 04:20.200
and the man
who will become our Cicada

04:20.320 --> 04:23.711
would be found
within this perimeter.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.712
And that took you how long?

04:25.800 --> 04:26.916
Oof, Dr. Snow.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.676
Eighteen hours 'cause I'm only
semi-excellent at algebra.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.240
You know this is calculus,
right?

04:32.320 --> 04:33.959
Guys, look,
calculon, algebra,

04:34.040 --> 04:35.976
either way it doesn't tell us
where the shrapnel fell.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.992
<i>Mais non.</i> You have to scan
the entire city

04:38.080 --> 04:39.560
to find
the exact location.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.791
Okay, so you need Sally
the satellite to find

04:41.880 --> 04:43.792
Sally the satellite
and we need Thomas Snow

04:43.880 --> 04:45.075
to point us
to Thomas Snow.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.629
- You lost him.
- At Thomas Snow.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.155
We've hit a dead end
with regards to my father.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.000
I looked through all
of his notes and papers.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.736
There's no more hidden
messages we could use.

04:53.760 --> 04:58.232
A satellite to run DNA
recognition patterns but...

04:58.320 --> 05:00.312
I thought losing him
when I was ten was hard, but,

05:00.400 --> 05:01.754
the idea that he's out there

05:01.840 --> 05:04.480
and I might not be able
to get to him...

05:04.560 --> 05:06.711
Maybe I can help you.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.439
I thought your powers
weren't working.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.592
No, not fully,
but this I can do.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.713
You okay?

05:28.800 --> 05:30.757
I saw him.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.274
I saw your dad in... in an office

05:32.360 --> 05:33.953
sketching something
in a notebook.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.759
I couldn't quite
make out what it was.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.433
Did you see anything else?

05:37.520 --> 05:41.639
Um, equations
on a chalkboard.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.216
We didn't have a chalkboard
in our home office.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.072
No, but tell us everything
that you saw.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.496
What's on the walls, what's on
the desk, what he was wearing.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.520
Leave nothing out.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.115
He had an ID.
It was, like, a yellow logo,

05:51.200 --> 05:52.793
like a yellow state building.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.475
Yellow logo, so,
not a state building.

05:55.560 --> 05:57.472
A university building.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.280
Hudson University.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.591
Professor Stein.
And did you know him?

06:02.680 --> 06:03.796
I knew he admired him,

06:03.880 --> 06:05.951
but I didn't realize
that they were friends.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.077
Add that to the growing list
of secrets.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.038
All right.
Let's go, giraffe.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.200
Thank you.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.680
It's what I do.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.240
<i>Natalie, come here. I have
a pre-wedding surprise for you.</i>

06:40.680 --> 06:43.559
Flawless Asscher cut diamonds
set in platinum.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.518
Over 383 karats.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.319
My great grandfather gave this
to his wife

06:47.400 --> 06:48.470
on their wedding day.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.119
Tomorrow, it's yours.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.874
Tomorrow?
That's torture.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.951
Stop!

08:18.040 --> 08:20.191
Mazel Tov.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.279
Can you describe the man
that you saw?

08:42.360 --> 08:45.558
I'd barely call him a man,
the way he moved.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.519
And when he looked back at me,

08:48.600 --> 08:49.875
it was terrifying.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.111
- Could you see his face?
- No.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.112
He was wearing
some sort of clown mask.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.496
And you're sure the necklace

08:55.520 --> 08:56.840
<i>is the only thing
that was stolen.</i>

08:56.880 --> 08:59.440
Yes, and it's irreplaceable.

08:59.520 --> 09:02.558
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.918
Hey.
A nice surprise.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.640
Yeah, well, a million dollar
jewelry theft is still news

09:11.720 --> 09:13.074
even in Central City, so.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.320
So, you're off the metas,
huh?

09:14.360 --> 09:15.635
Yeah, no, not today.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.496
You know, I think I'm just
gonna follow up on this

09:17.520 --> 09:18.874
while it's still fresh.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.616
- I'll see you tonight, okay?
- Okay, wait. Hang on.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.711
I mean, we're working
on the same case.

09:22.800 --> 09:27.431
Why don't we pool resources,
maybe solve this one together.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.318
Yeah, I don't know, Barry,
it's just...

09:29.400 --> 09:31.756
Come on, grab some Big Belly
on the way to S.T.A.R. Labs.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.712
It'll be like a date.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.514
- All right.
- All right. Come on.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.914
<i>This is the life.</i>

09:39.000 --> 09:41.276
Seriously,
I could stay here forever.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.874
No worries,
no schrap from Mom...

09:42.960 --> 09:44.235
Wait, wait, wait,
what was that?

09:44.320 --> 09:46.755
- Schrap.
- Schrap?

09:46.840 --> 09:49.196
Schrap. You know, like all
the nagging that mom does.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.237
I mean,
she acts like she supports me,

09:51.360 --> 09:53.352
but what she really
wants is a boring,

09:53.440 --> 09:55.909
quiet daughter who just wants
to stay inside all day

09:56.000 --> 09:57.320
instead of go out
and do anything

09:57.400 --> 09:58.776
that might be
the least bit dangerous.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.838
Nora, this is the West house.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.560
In it, every West
is given respect,

10:04.640 --> 10:07.394
most especially your mother.

10:07.480 --> 10:11.156
I am sure she raised you
as best she could.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.596
She raised me to be afraid
of the world.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.195
But I'm a hero,
you know, like Dad.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.396
And we have to keep moving

10:17.480 --> 10:19.756
until everyone
that needs us is safe.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.309
Okay.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.392
I'm sorry, what is this for?

10:24.480 --> 10:26.756
When Papa Joe comes back,
this table

10:26.840 --> 10:28.638
is going to
finally be built.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.591
You wanted to keep moving.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.639
- Oh, do I have to?
- Yes.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.279
All right, I'll make you
a deal.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.919
For every chore you do

10:39.000 --> 10:41.913
I'll tell you one thing Papa
Joe told me about your father

10:42.000 --> 10:45.277
that didn't make it into
the precious Flash museum.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.477
Oh, Mama Cecile,
the museum has

10:47.560 --> 10:49.376
a complete record of
all of Dad's accomplishments.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.496
Including the time Barry
ended up in an alternate past

10:51.520 --> 10:54.115
filled with golden giants
called "Grodans"?

10:54.200 --> 10:55.429
Wait, what?

10:55.520 --> 10:56.520
Grodans.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.431
Done.
So then what happened?

11:05.520 --> 11:07.830
Not done.
Wait for it.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.192
Huh.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.555
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:18.000 --> 11:20.435
<i>So, why exactly
does Caitlin have a key</i>

11:20.520 --> 11:21.874
to Professor Stein's
old office?

11:21.960 --> 11:24.475
Clarissa gave me a key.
She didn't realize that Martin

11:24.560 --> 11:26.711
and my father knew
each other either.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.393
I wonder
what he was doing in here.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.676
Well, perhaps Mr. Ramon
could vibe the chalkboard

11:30.760 --> 11:31.989
and we could see
for ourselves.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.753
What do you think?

11:48.600 --> 11:50.319
What did you see?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.754
Hydrogen chains bonded
over and over.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.119
Two oxygen
at absolute zero.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.919
It's like it's
making heavy water.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.720
Not heavy water.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.234
Ice.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.755
Another one of my father's
hidden messages?

12:12.400 --> 12:13.436
Ah.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.429
<i>"Khione"?</i>

12:17.520 --> 12:19.637
What kind of a message
is "Khione"?

12:19.720 --> 12:20.995
A clear one.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.720
At least to me.
Look, monsieur Ramon,

12:24.800 --> 12:27.952
you said that earlier that
you could see that Dr. Snow,

12:28.040 --> 12:29.872
her father sketching
something, right?

12:29.960 --> 12:32.634
That sketch that you could
almost make out...

12:34.680 --> 12:38.469
Did it look
a little something like this?

12:39.400 --> 12:41.392
Good lord,
are you a speedster?

12:41.480 --> 12:44.359
Speed sketcher.
It's a modest talent.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.954
My father was drawing me?

12:46.040 --> 12:49.590
Not you.
Khione.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.399
Khione, a Greek goddess.

12:51.480 --> 12:56.157
Child of the North Wind,
whose realm was ice and snow.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.357
Khione.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.920
Killer Frost.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.816
<i>That means that whatever
Thomas was doing,</i>

13:01.840 --> 13:03.593
he knew that there
were two of you.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.961
<i>Also, it stands to
reason that Thomas was there</i>

13:06.000 --> 13:07.992
at the point of creation
of Killer Frost.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.800
So, he knew the truth
about Killer Frost?

13:15.240 --> 13:17.197
He knew who I really am?

13:17.280 --> 13:18.634
Right.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.200
- Did I scare him away?
- No, this wasn't your fault.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.720
Look, I don't know why he left,
but it wasn't because of you,

13:25.800 --> 13:27.200
and we're gonna prove that.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.399
You okay?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.676
Yeah, just lost my footing
there for a second.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.399
- What...
- What did you see?

13:43.360 --> 13:44.919
You guys ever hear
of Viera Chemicals?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.276
Oh, it's an old chem lab
out in the Barrens,

13:47.360 --> 13:49.158
but it's been shut down
for years.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.436
Well,
what are we waiting for?

14:11.160 --> 14:12.976
You know, it's been great
seeing you out there again,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.878
doing what you love.

14:16.760 --> 14:21.277
Yeah, I guess some girls grow
up wanting to be Supergirl.

14:21.360 --> 14:26.799
I always wanted to be Soledad
O'Brien or Christiane Amanpour.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.395
So yeah,
it's really great to reconnect.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.549
That's weird.
It says the hair I found

14:34.640 --> 14:37.360
is human
but it can't pull any DNA.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.955
- Maybe run it again?
- Yeah.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.433
Come on, Novick.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.672
You wanna improve
Gotham City's skyline,

14:48.760 --> 14:50.035
you do it with a building

14:50.120 --> 14:52.555
nobody can take
their eyes off of.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.632
That's one of mine.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.474
You go with me,
I'll design you a building

14:57.560 --> 15:00.712
that makes the Burj Khalifa
look like a strip mall.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.315
Architecture
means everything to me.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.720
I mean, you tell me.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.797
How many other architects
have won

15:06.880 --> 15:10.840
the Pritzker Prize three times?

15:10.920 --> 15:12.274
Good choice.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.793
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

15:20.880 --> 15:22.633
By some really weird markings

15:22.720 --> 15:24.200
at the bottom
of a large gift box

15:24.280 --> 15:27.398
that I'm pretty sure
was opened from the inside.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.136
Okay, you know
you're opening all of our mail

15:29.160 --> 15:30.160
from now on, right?

15:32.560 --> 15:35.519
Somebody called in a bomb
threat at Seaver Architects.

15:39.480 --> 15:43.269
- What happened?
- That thing, it did this.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.037
Flash.

16:00.680 --> 16:05.311
That thing destroyed
my life's work.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.750
So, he squeezed his way

16:38.840 --> 16:40.120
through
an air conditioning vent?

16:40.200 --> 16:43.272
Yeah, he could stretch
kinda like Ralph,

16:43.360 --> 16:44.400
except he was wearing a...

16:44.480 --> 16:45.755
- Clown mask.
- Yup.

16:45.840 --> 16:49.072
Just like the guy that stole
the Winehouse necklace.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.959
Mm-hmm.
We got a stretching clown meta.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.918
Yeah,
that's not creepy at all.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.195
Yeah.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.960
Did you find any more
of those weird lines?

16:57.040 --> 16:59.032
No, and if there's more,
they're buried underneath

16:59.160 --> 17:01.356
tons of rubble, just like
our meta, unless he was able

17:01.440 --> 17:02.840
to stretch out
of that one too.

17:02.920 --> 17:07.039
Which... I'm sure he was.

17:07.119 --> 17:08.917
- The lines.
- What?

17:09.000 --> 17:12.310
Well, I mean, our meta can
stretch and contort, right?

17:12.400 --> 17:14.232
<i>What if his fingerprints
can too?</i>

17:17.560 --> 17:19.040
Got him.
Peter Merkel.

17:19.119 --> 17:21.077
And he was arrested
for B&E two years ago.

17:21.160 --> 17:25.119
Wait, Peter Merkel, the son
of billionaire Theresa Merkel?

17:25.200 --> 17:27.510
Yup.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.576
How does someone go from being
a member of high society

17:29.600 --> 17:32.069
to stealing heirlooms
and blowing up buildings?

17:32.160 --> 17:34.038
Maybe we should attend
this gala she's hosting

17:34.120 --> 17:35.349
and ask her ourselves.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.511
Uh, I don't know,
what if Merkel's there?

17:37.600 --> 17:38.720
So what?
We'll come prepared.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.120
Some meta handcuffs for me,

17:40.200 --> 17:42.795
a taser for you,
and we get to dress up.

17:42.880 --> 17:43.880
- Barry.
- What?

17:43.960 --> 17:46.077
This is a meta investigation;
this is not date night.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.391
I'm just saying,
I look really good in a tux.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.832
When did this happen?

17:54.920 --> 17:56.798
The night your father
disappeared.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.280
Oh.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.398
Well, well, well.
Liquid nitrogen.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.312
That's a potent accelerant,
is it not?

18:03.400 --> 18:06.199
Oh, this place,
it would have gone up. Whoa.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.556
So, all my father's work
is completely gone?

18:08.640 --> 18:10.757
Well, not necessarily.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.638
I mean, think about it.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.176
Police listed this fire as
accidental,

18:14.200 --> 18:15.776
but they didn't know
about the connection

18:15.800 --> 18:17.519
to Caitlin's father, so...

18:17.600 --> 18:20.513
Ralph, my father told me
to come find him.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.957
Yeah, no, I know that,
but a guy who disappears

18:24.080 --> 18:27.073
on the night of a warehouse
fire and who's hard to find?

18:27.160 --> 18:29.277
Well, if you think this was
arson, let me tell you,

18:29.360 --> 18:31.256
if her father did this, well,
he would need a lot of help

18:31.280 --> 18:33.670
covering his tracks, right?

18:33.760 --> 18:36.355
Yeah.
Maybe he got it.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.776
<i>Listen, my mom may not
be the best person,</i>

18:44.800 --> 18:47.076
but there's no way she'd be
party to something like this.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.674
There's one way to find out.

18:48.760 --> 18:49.816
What, you want to question
the mother again?

18:49.840 --> 18:51.296
You already did that,
and what did you get? Nothing.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.198
Well it's a clue.
Surely, we should follow it.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.536
You already know
that this is still

18:54.560 --> 18:56.240
Tannhauser facility, okay?
So you're wrong.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.470
Oh, I'm wrong? I'm wrong?

18:57.560 --> 18:58.776
I'm the one who figured out
Cicada's mask.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.519
You couldn't figure that out.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.456
You said you wouldn't doubt me,
that was your mistake.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.676
Enough, yeah, enough!
Just give me this.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.799
<i>Cisco?</i>

19:11.840 --> 19:13.513
Cisco?

19:37.400 --> 19:40.393
You look amazing, by the way.
Thank you.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.479
There's Theresa Merkel.
Come on.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.736
Wait. What are we going
to say?

19:44.760 --> 19:47.150
We can't just ask her if
her son was recently hit

19:47.240 --> 19:48.754
by dark matter into shrapnel.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.559
You'll think of something.
Me?

19:51.480 --> 19:54.439
So sorry.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.035
Hi, Mrs. Merkel.
I'm Iris West Allen.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.918
Oh, I know who you are.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.912
Don't you usually
write about lunatics

20:01.000 --> 20:03.993
and the heroes
who catch them?

20:04.080 --> 20:05.719
Well, you know,
supporting the arts

20:05.800 --> 20:07.678
is a citywide concern.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.036
- Hmm.
- I'm Barry Allen.

20:10.120 --> 20:13.272
Ah. And you're obviously not
here to make a sizeable

20:13.360 --> 20:16.194
donation which means you,
my dear,

20:16.280 --> 20:17.919
are here on assignment.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.392
All right, ask whatever you
like. You have two minutes.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.676
Well,
it's about your son, Peter.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.558
When was the last time
that you saw him?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.438
That would be two years ago

20:30.520 --> 20:33.194
when he broke
into his own house.

20:33.280 --> 20:37.194
I was out of town,
and my staff had him arrested.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.760
Do you know
where Peter is now?

20:38.880 --> 20:40.553
No, and I don't care.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.519
See,
I gave him the world.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.479
The finest private schools,
his own wing to play in.

20:46.560 --> 20:50.110
But he just
never appreciated it.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.040
Enjoy the party.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.236
I feel kinda bad for him now.

20:58.360 --> 21:01.159
She's so cold.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.839
Can you imagine
what that was like?

21:05.680 --> 21:06.830
Hey, you know what?

21:06.920 --> 21:08.559
It's not a date
without a dance.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.950
Barry, wait.
I mean, this is work, right?

21:11.080 --> 21:14.869
We just hit a dead end, so,
why don't we just go home?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.515
Hey, hey.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.990
Just one dance, all right?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.034
Okay.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.550
You know, we never really
had our first dance.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.675
Yeah, this is really nice.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.037
Excuse me for a second.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.839
Hey. You okay?

22:26.880 --> 22:30.510
She gave her only son
everything that she had

22:30.600 --> 22:33.320
and it wasn't enough.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.074
Just like I'm not enough
for Nora.

22:36.160 --> 22:39.073
You are nothing
like that woman in there.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.595
You're sure, Barry?

22:41.680 --> 22:42.936
I mean, I love our daughter
with all my heart,

22:42.960 --> 22:44.633
but she hates me.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.951
Because I turn my back on her

22:47.040 --> 22:49.953
just like Theresa Merkel
did to her son.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.999
I lie to her
about everything that she is.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.790
And I prevent her from living
the life that she deserves.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.754
- I'd hate me too.
- Iris.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.799
You are never going to be
the person that Nora knows

23:05.880 --> 23:07.109
from the future.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.476
That's the thing.
It's not even up to us.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.390
I've already become her

23:13.480 --> 23:15.437
and I didn't even
have a choice.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.234
<i>While you were unconscious,</i>

23:38.320 --> 23:40.312
I scanned your wounds.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.995
There are still trace amounts
of aluminum-beryllium alloy

23:43.080 --> 23:44.434
fused within your hands.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.776
It's remnants
from Cicada's dagger.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.359
See, this is... this
is what I need.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.440
I just need rest.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.955
No, Cisco, rest is not
going to fix this, okay?

23:51.040 --> 23:53.236
Every time you vibe or breach,
the dark matter

23:53.320 --> 23:54.936
is going to affect
your central nervous system,

23:54.960 --> 23:56.679
causing you more and more pain.

23:56.760 --> 24:00.595
Wait... which you must have been
experiencing all day today.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.080
Why didn't you say anything?

24:04.080 --> 24:07.676
Because you're my friend
and you needed my help.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.229
Okay, but I would never ask
you to hurt yourself.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.879
Every time you vibe

24:11.960 --> 24:13.917
you are going to have
more and more seizures.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.357
Then what am I
supposed to do?

24:24.840 --> 24:27.196
I remember when these powers
were a curse.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.879
Seeing Thawne kill me
over and over.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.600
Knowing that darkness.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.112
I didn't want that.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.875
I didn't want to be a hero.

24:40.960 --> 24:45.159
These powers were a part of me.
I had to learn that.

24:45.240 --> 24:48.995
And when I did,
they showed me everything.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.039
I could vibe every clue.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.032
I could breach us
wherever we needed to go.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.112
I could bring my value
to the team.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.152
If I can't take the pain,
that means Cicada wins.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.709
No.
Hey.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.554
Listen, I get it, okay?

25:07.640 --> 25:11.554
When DeVoe took away
Killer Frost, I was destroyed.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.160
But you know what?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.556
I'm still here.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.280
And so are you.

25:19.360 --> 25:23.434
Because you are Cisco Ramon.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.273
Genius engineer,

25:25.360 --> 25:27.431
prodigy hacker,

25:27.520 --> 25:29.477
and the mechanic
who built a cold gun

25:29.560 --> 25:32.598
that could stop
a speedster.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.799
And you're my friend.

25:35.880 --> 25:39.271
You're my friend who went out
there and hurt himself today.

25:39.360 --> 25:42.910
Just to help me try
and find my dad.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.595
And that wasn't Vibe.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.558
That was Cisco,

25:47.640 --> 25:49.677
and that's the guy I need.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.798
That cold gun
was pretty amazing.

25:53.880 --> 25:57.317
It was stolen
almost immediately...

25:57.400 --> 25:59.756
Oh, immediately.

25:59.840 --> 26:01.513
But yeah,
it was pretty great.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.599
You know, this case
will keep until morning.

26:11.680 --> 26:15.674
Yeah, I know, it's just
Merkel's still out there.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.336
And the gala was a dead end
and all we know

26:17.360 --> 26:20.353
is that he committed two
completely unrelated crimes.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.317
I don't know what to do
about Nora, Barry.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.436
Yeah.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.558
Well, look. I mean, you know
I'm on your side with this.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.518
If you dampen her powers
in the future,

26:35.600 --> 26:36.776
it's because
you care about her.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.154
You're doing it
to keep her safe.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.670
Yeah.
Just because I can protect her

26:40.760 --> 26:42.956
doesn't mean
that I'm a good mom.

26:46.240 --> 26:50.280
This isn't like
what happened with Francine.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.956
Isn't it?

26:57.240 --> 27:02.076
She left me and my dad kept it
a secret all to protect me.

27:02.160 --> 27:04.197
And when she came back,
I pushed her away.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.517
I barely had a chance
to know her before she...

27:14.920 --> 27:18.197
I lost my chance to connect
with my mom and...

27:18.320 --> 27:21.074
Now when I get older, Nora is
going to push me away too.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.078
That's not gonna happen.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.669
Well, it sure seems to be
going in that direction.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.797
Then choose
a different route.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.236
Make a different choice
when you raise Nora.

27:30.320 --> 27:33.154
If you don't want to be that
person, don't be that person.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.160
It's not that simple,
Barry.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.273
You're not your mom.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.238
You're not Iris
from the future,

27:42.320 --> 27:44.551
and you don't have to be, ever.

27:47.120 --> 27:50.113
I think
you should stop worrying

27:50.200 --> 27:53.955
about who you might become

27:54.040 --> 27:56.953
and reconnect with who you are,
now.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.109
Yeah.

28:01.240 --> 28:04.153
Now, let's go home,
all right?

28:13.520 --> 28:15.557
Actually,
can I just meet you there?

28:17.520 --> 28:19.716
I think I have a lead.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.591
Okay.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.754
Shut up.
Dad did not keep singing.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.559
No way was your father
gonna let

28:32.640 --> 28:35.314
the middle school
production of <i>Guys and Dolls</i>

28:35.440 --> 28:37.272
turn out to be a disaster.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.393
Okay, um, one more.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.599
So, when your dad was
about ten,

28:44.680 --> 28:48.674
there was a kid in his class
that lost his folks.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.673
Kid stopped smiling,
barely spoke.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.956
And for some reason,
all of the other kids in school

28:54.040 --> 28:55.599
were being so mean to him.

28:55.680 --> 29:00.471
So, your father had lunch with
this boy

29:00.560 --> 29:03.155
every single day

29:03.240 --> 29:05.277
<i>for a whole year.</i>

29:05.360 --> 29:08.671
And when springtime came
and the yearbook came out

29:08.760 --> 29:12.595
your father gave the kid
an entire page

29:12.680 --> 29:14.956
and the photos
of his science fair project

29:15.040 --> 29:16.872
made him "most
likely to succeed."

29:19.280 --> 29:21.351
And then the boy
finally smiled.

29:25.840 --> 29:29.800
Wait, but Dad
wasn't in yearbook.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.200
That story
wasn't about Dad, was it?

29:39.360 --> 29:43.434
It was about Mom helping Dad.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.631
Wait, were all those stories
you told me about Mom?

29:50.720 --> 29:52.598
Nora, you're projecting
all of these feelings

29:52.680 --> 29:57.152
that you have
about Iris 30 years from now.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.914
You're not getting to know
who she is today.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.431
These stories that I told you,

30:03.520 --> 30:06.513
they're what made me fall
in love with the Wests.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.832
Made me realize how special
this family is.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.479
So...

30:14.840 --> 30:18.914
If you liked them,
plenty more in here.

30:50.760 --> 30:51.760
Hey.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.797
<i>Hey babe, I just spoke
with Mrs. Merkel.</i>

30:53.880 --> 30:55.792
<i>I think I know
what Peter wants.</i>

30:55.880 --> 30:57.473
<i>The jewelry, the building,</i>

30:57.560 --> 30:59.756
<i>they all meant something
personal to the victim.</i>

30:59.840 --> 31:00.840
<i>He wants to deliver</i>

31:00.960 --> 31:03.555
<i>the most painfully emotional
blow possible.</i>

31:03.640 --> 31:05.359
<i>Just like his family did
to him.</i>

31:05.440 --> 31:08.239
<i>You... you okay?</i>

31:08.320 --> 31:10.551
Yeah.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.149
Yeah, sorry, that MO
fits perfectly.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.720
Who do you think's
his next victim?

31:14.800 --> 31:16.792
Ugh!

31:16.880 --> 31:18.792
Barry?

31:18.880 --> 31:20.633
<i>Come and get him.</i>

31:27.920 --> 31:30.037
Guys, Merkel kidnapped Barry.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.679
- What?
- How's that even possible?

31:31.760 --> 31:32.880
He's got Barry's meta-cuffs.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.998
- Well, that would do it.
- Who are you calling?

31:40.600 --> 31:42.239
Damn it, Nora, pick up.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.360
I'll ping Barry's cell,
see if I can get a location.

31:45.920 --> 31:48.116
He's in Eaglesham apartments
on Simone Ave.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.616
<i>I don't think he's
in the apartments</i>

31:49.640 --> 31:50.710
so much as on them.

31:50.800 --> 31:51.800
Right.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.395
Okay, guys. We don't have a
speedster, Cisco can't breach,

31:54.480 --> 31:55.776
and Killer Frost
is out of commission.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.076
We need to come up with a plan
to rescue Barry now.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.656
The extrapolator.
We can breach in and grab him.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.680
Great, where is it?

32:00.760 --> 32:02.433
Right.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.955
Uh, about that...

32:06.240 --> 32:07.240
I broke it.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.033
How did you break this?
Batting practice?

32:09.120 --> 32:11.136
- It's not user friendly.
- You're not user friendly!

32:11.160 --> 32:12.196
Cisco.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.696
It's going to take me at
least an hour to fix it.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.336
- Cisco, we don't have an hour.
- Well, I...

32:15.360 --> 32:17.556
No, but we do have me.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.713
Let's go save The Flash.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.759
That was inspiring.

32:23.840 --> 32:24.840
Yeah.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.432
- You got a cuff key?
- Thanks.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.275
I'll drive.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.794
Actually,
I wanna try something.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.473
Saw it in a comic book.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.480
Whoo-hoo!

32:36.560 --> 32:38.438
Whoo!

32:38.520 --> 32:41.638
Ah, you're choking me.
You're choking me.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.480
Hey, I used to live there.

32:48.560 --> 32:49.560
Ralph.

32:49.640 --> 32:50.915
Oh, I got it.

33:37.960 --> 33:40.759
Police man.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.877
Fancy cuffs.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.711
Peter,
you don't want to do this.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.632
Look, I know
how you got your abilities.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.155
The night of the enlightenment,
right?

33:51.240 --> 33:54.039
You were hit by a piece of
the satellite, weren't you?

33:54.120 --> 33:55.554
Crushed!

33:55.640 --> 33:57.472
Snapped.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.394
Broken.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.472
Okay, well, I know people
who can help you.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.592
People who could stop
your suffering.

34:10.600 --> 34:14.355
Suffering can't be stopped.

34:14.440 --> 34:18.878
Especially hers.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.838
If you touch Iris...

34:20.920 --> 34:23.594
Don't want to hear your pain.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.149
Only your wife's.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.554
Let him go.

34:31.639 --> 34:33.552
The wife.

34:33.639 --> 34:37.395
You fire, he dies.

34:42.719 --> 34:44.313
Okay.

34:49.360 --> 34:51.112
Okay.

34:51.199 --> 34:54.034
Just don't hurt him.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.480
Hey Caitlin, what's up?

35:03.280 --> 35:05.476
You heard the lady,
Raggedy Dandy.

35:05.560 --> 35:06.710
Let him go.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.315
Okay.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.632
Barry!

35:25.960 --> 35:29.032
Mom. Holy schrap.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.999
You just threw yourself off
a building to save Dad?

35:32.080 --> 35:35.232
- Yeah.
- That was beyond schway.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.113
You're crazy.
I am.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.477
- Thank you. I love you.
- I love you.

35:42.320 --> 35:44.391
Oh, my God.
Ralph is still up there.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.120
I hope I don't land
on my keys!

35:47.200 --> 35:48.475
Ah.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.393
Uh.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.231
You guys
still have those meta-cuffs?

36:09.640 --> 36:12.633
Iris West Allen, I know
badassery when I see it

36:12.720 --> 36:14.951
and that was raw, unrefined,
cage-free,

36:15.040 --> 36:17.111
non-GMO badassery right there.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.840
- You dove off a building.
- For me.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.479
Yeah, I guess I kinda did.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.279
What was going
through your mind?

36:23.360 --> 36:27.195
"Uh, please, God,
don't let me drop this key."

36:27.280 --> 36:30.352
I mean, weren't you afraid?
You're not a speedster.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.432
No, I'm not.

36:32.520 --> 36:36.912
But my husband and my partner
and my best friend is.

36:38.200 --> 36:39.998
Well, not to interrupt
this wonderful moment

36:40.080 --> 36:43.278
that I just interrupted, but,
you know, I helped defeat

36:43.360 --> 36:45.113
- that boneless bozo too.
- Mm-hmm.

36:45.200 --> 36:48.955
It wasn't so easy.
And that... God, that mask.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.997
It's like one of those
porcelain dolls

36:51.080 --> 36:55.313
that's gonna
kill you while you sleep.

36:55.840 --> 36:59.675
I thought it was more like
a ragdoll.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.116
Yeah, that's right.
Still got it.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.197
Hold your applause.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.336
Guess it's off
to Iron Heights

37:05.360 --> 37:07.795
for slippery old Rag Doll.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.156
Oh, wait, you're... you're
leaving?

37:10.240 --> 37:12.038
Yeah, um,
there's something I need to do,

37:12.120 --> 37:14.476
but I'll be right back.
I promise.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.272
She looks happy.

37:18.360 --> 37:22.320
Yeah, she really does.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.355
I do that too.

37:32.440 --> 37:33.715
Oh.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.395
I was writing
about what you did tonight.

37:38.480 --> 37:39.914
It was awesome.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.434
Thanks.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.591
I guess
it kinda runs in the family.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.758
- Where did you get that?
- Oh.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.714
Dad's always adding to it.
It's so silly.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.111
No, it's not. It's your life.

38:03.200 --> 38:06.955
I mean, editor
of the school paper by age 11.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.750
Exposing a corrupt school
teacher at the age of 15.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.480
I mean, you never talk
about this stuff.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.592
In the... the future, I mean.

38:15.680 --> 38:20.072
It's, um, one of your
off-limits topics.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.197
I'm not allowed
to ask about it.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.349
Look.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.000
Nora.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.274
I am not that person
in the future.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.438
And nothing
is off limits to me, okay?

38:42.520 --> 38:45.991
I'm not gonna sit
behind a desk and say "no."

38:46.080 --> 38:48.640
I want you to live your life.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.752
And...

38:53.280 --> 38:55.875
I want you to be
a part of mine.

38:55.960 --> 38:59.510
No secrets, no lies, just...

38:59.600 --> 39:01.671
Us being who we are today.

39:04.480 --> 39:07.075
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.200
Did you really stake out the
girls' bathroom in third grade

39:16.280 --> 39:19.478
to prove that the school
janitor wasn't cleaning it?

39:19.560 --> 39:21.711
I'm gonna kill Cecile.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.280
<i>But, um, yes.</i>

39:23.360 --> 39:26.034
<i>I was a real-life Nancy Drew
back then.</i>

39:26.120 --> 39:29.113
Wow. That's cool, Mom.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.200
Um, is it?

39:33.360 --> 39:34.919
<i>Shirley and I were talking,</i>

39:35.000 --> 39:36.416
and while we realize our styles
are very different,

39:36.440 --> 39:37.440
what we both like...

39:37.560 --> 39:38.755
Is a good mystery.

39:38.840 --> 39:39.936
So we put our heads together.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.496
And after some
intellectual hair pulling,

39:41.520 --> 39:44.399
we realized that if your mom
wasn't lying...

39:44.480 --> 39:46.870
And Tannhauser was still
somehow involved...

39:46.960 --> 39:48.800
There's only one sure place
somebody could hide

39:48.880 --> 39:51.315
without anyone
knowing about it.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.153
A Tannhauser black ops site.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.356
There you go.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.616
I mean,
they've got dozens of them.

39:55.640 --> 39:58.200
They were safe houses to test
dangerous pathogens for the CDC

39:58.280 --> 40:00.840
but Mom hasn't taken
a government job in years.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.838
They'd all be shut down.

40:02.960 --> 40:06.351
Yeah, that's why it's
the best place to hide.

40:06.440 --> 40:07.954
Okay, so how do we find them?

40:08.040 --> 40:10.919
Without Sally?
Uh, have you tried Google?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.037
Yes.
We just use their satellite.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.080
I don't think we can use
someone else's satellite.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.640
Or maybe we can.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.799
When DeVoe took over Sally,
he also launched four

40:23.880 --> 40:26.236
of his own satellites to bring
about the enlightenment,

40:26.360 --> 40:30.400
but now that he's gone
maybe we can work around the...

40:30.480 --> 40:32.676
Multiplexed
burst-model channels

40:32.760 --> 40:34.592
and the inter-SV handoff.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.151
We've got eyes and ears.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.754
We've got eyes and ears!

40:47.880 --> 40:49.234
- I knew you could do it.
- Ah!

40:49.320 --> 40:51.232
- Oh, sorry.
- That was dumb.

40:52.560 --> 40:56.839
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce you to...

40:56.920 --> 41:03.315
HAL, Robbie, Data,
and Colossus.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.638
I don't really like
those names.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.473
But nonetheless,
those can help us

41:08.560 --> 41:10.870
in tracking the shards
from the satellite?

41:10.960 --> 41:12.960
These babies can help with
anything and everything.

41:13.040 --> 41:15.096
<i>Well, once we figure out
which one hit Cicada,</i>

41:15.120 --> 41:16.800
we can figure out
how he got his abilities,

41:16.880 --> 41:18.240
maybe find some
kind of a weakness.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.631
So, what we are waiting for?

41:25.920 --> 41:29.630
Caitlin?
Do you know what this means?

41:29.720 --> 41:32.633
We can locate your father.

41:32.760 --> 41:35.400
Wait, wait.
I, uh...

41:37.560 --> 41:39.074
Isn't this what you wanted?

41:39.160 --> 41:41.117
It is, I just...

41:46.560 --> 41:48.517
Okay.

41:50.760 --> 41:53.355
When you're ready.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.669
Thanks.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.874
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
