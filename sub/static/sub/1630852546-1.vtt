WEBVTT

01:26.416 --> 01:28.166
DJ (over radio):
There's your Golden Earring,

01:28.250 --> 01:30.375
and they're gonna be opening
for The Who for three days

01:30.458 --> 01:32.000
at Madison Square Garden, starting...

01:32.083 --> 01:33.708
(radio shuts off)

01:41.708 --> 01:44.125
(typewriter keys clacking)

01:44.208 --> 01:45.625
(typewriter bell dings)

01:45.708 --> 01:47.583
(bird cawing)

01:53.666 --> 01:55.250
Is that Uncle Charlie?

01:55.333 --> 01:57.083
I was trying to fucking help you pitch.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.541
Help me pitch?

01:58.625 --> 02:00.458
This is batting practice, okay?

02:00.541 --> 02:02.375
It's not for you to help me pitch.

02:02.458 --> 02:04.083
I'm worried about you.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.083
(overlapping chatter)

02:06.166 --> 02:08.291
All right, shut the fuck up.

02:08.375 --> 02:10.041
All right, all right, all right. Ready?

02:10.125 --> 02:11.375
Ah, this guy's got nothing.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.166
You got nothing. Come on, Chaz.

02:13.250 --> 02:15.916
-- All right, here we go.
-- Come on, come on, Goose.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.875
Come on, get it by him. Get it by him.

02:18.875 --> 02:20.875
(indistinct chatter)

02:29.333 --> 02:31.333
I'll see you back at the house.

02:32.416 --> 02:34.375
Ruthie's back there, too.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.000
Be a full house.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.541
Okay.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.666
-What are you gonna do?
-Come on, Chaz. Come on.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.708
(chatter continues indistinctly)

02:46.875 --> 02:48.791
Come on.

02:48.875 --> 02:50.750
We're going home.

02:51.833 --> 02:54.916
We're going home. Again.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.541
All right, here you go. Nice grip.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.083
Here you go, kid.

03:00.416 --> 03:02.458
-Use your glove.
-(laughter)

03:13.625 --> 03:15.791
(creaking)

03:20.000 --> 03:21.791
It was 1973,

03:21.875 --> 03:24.500
and after failing
to pay our rent for five months,

03:24.583 --> 03:28.000
my mom and I had to move
back home to my grandpa's house.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.791
(sighs)

03:37.583 --> 03:41.125
Home never meant the same thing
to my mother as it did to me.

03:41.208 --> 03:44.708
To her, it meant failure,
the place you ended up

03:44.791 --> 03:47.416
when all the things
she was counting on fell through.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.666
Work, apartment, boyfriend,
not always in that order.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.833
But I loved it.

03:54.916 --> 03:58.958
To me, Grandpa's house was
a revolving door of cousins and aunts,

03:59.041 --> 04:01.791
with a full complement
of laughter and tears

04:01.875 --> 04:04.125
and an occasional nervous breakdown.

04:04.208 --> 04:07.625
But above all,
it's where Uncle Charlie lived.

04:07.708 --> 04:10.916
And when you're 11 years old,
you want an Uncle Charlie.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.958
Everybody needs to know
the cesspool isn't taking it.

04:15.041 --> 04:18.583
If you take a leak, take it outside.

04:19.666 --> 04:21.750
I could use a little help in here.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.541
I'm not the maid.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.958
Jesus Christ!

04:27.041 --> 04:29.833
My father was a radio DJ in New York.

04:29.916 --> 04:31.791
They called him The Voice.

04:31.875 --> 04:35.458
He played Top 40 hits,
and he'd talk about the musicians.

04:35.541 --> 04:37.583
I only met him once,
and I was pretty young,

04:37.666 --> 04:42.083
so when I could, I'd sneak away
and listen to him on the radio.

04:42.166 --> 04:45.083
I had to sneak, 'cause after he left us,

04:45.166 --> 04:49.833
well, let's just say Mom took a pair
of scissors to every picture he was in.

04:49.916 --> 04:51.916
(laughter, indistinct chatter over TV)

04:54.833 --> 04:56.458
(over radio):

04:56.541 --> 04:58.458
-(children laughing)

05:13.875 --> 05:16.416
(indistinct sportscast playing)

05:18.583 --> 05:20.583
(Mom sniffling, sobbing softly)

05:27.500 --> 05:29.750
(sighs)

05:29.833 --> 05:31.125
I like it.

05:31.208 --> 05:33.375
(Mom sighs)

05:33.458 --> 05:34.875
Do you?

05:34.958 --> 05:37.291
It's people. I like to have people.

05:45.625 --> 05:48.291
(sighs)
Tomorrow is another day.

05:50.041 --> 05:52.416
Why does Grandpa say
we should all clear out?

05:52.500 --> 05:57.041
Because he's a selfish old prick
who resents taking care of his family.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.791
Like Dad?

05:59.875 --> 06:01.291
No, honey.

06:01.375 --> 06:04.166
Grandpa resents taking care of his family.

06:04.250 --> 06:08.291
Your father has never
taken care of anybody at all.

06:10.875 --> 06:12.416
Oh.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.125
(softly):
Oh.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.166
("Love Will Find a Way" by Pablo Cruise
playing over radio)

06:18.250 --> 06:20.791
(indistinct, overlapping chatter)

06:32.500 --> 06:34.458
(indistinct chatter continues)

06:34.541 --> 06:37.625
That's Pablo Cruise
with "Love Will Find a Way"...

-(broadcast cuts out)

06:39.833 --> 06:41.583
(chatter stops)

06:47.708 --> 06:49.541
Hey, now, eat your cereal.

06:54.166 --> 06:55.791
Okay, two rules.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.791
I'm never gonna let you win, ever.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.458
You beat me,
you know you beat me fair and square,

07:00.541 --> 07:02.333
but I never let you win.

07:02.416 --> 07:04.208
And I'm gonna always tell you the truth.

07:06.166 --> 07:08.041
I saw you in the yard playing sports.

07:08.125 --> 07:09.416
You're not very good.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.708
And... probably not gonna get
a whole lot better,

07:12.791 --> 07:17.833
so it might be wise for you,
in order to avoid tears and disappointment

07:17.916 --> 07:20.750
and, above all, delusion,

07:20.833 --> 07:22.708
you know, find some other activities
that you like.

07:22.791 --> 07:25.000
You know, like, uh,
what do you like to do the most?

07:25.083 --> 07:26.083
I like to read.

07:26.166 --> 07:28.458
I also like to read.

07:28.541 --> 07:30.500
I mean, I'm good at sports, too, but...

07:30.583 --> 07:33.541
So, this thing about the radio.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.625
You're gonna look
for your father in the radio.

07:36.708 --> 07:39.541
You think your father is in the radio.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.666
He's not in the radio.

07:41.750 --> 07:46.375
He's just an asshole
who happens to be on the radio.

07:46.458 --> 07:49.041
Don't look for your father to save you.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.000
And don't play sports.

07:53.083 --> 07:55.083
That's all I have to say.

07:55.166 --> 07:56.666
The game is five-card stud.

07:57.666 --> 07:59.666
(dog barking in distance)

08:03.000 --> 08:05.333
Mom can use some money.

08:05.416 --> 08:09.541
This is The Voice at 97.1 on your dial.

08:09.625 --> 08:11.625
She's really tired after work.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.583

08:14.666 --> 08:16.625

08:16.708 --> 08:20.125
and you'll be registered to win $500.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.416
What do you say? The top ten.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.666
You can't win if you don't play.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.083
Is this seat taken?

08:30.166 --> 08:32.416
No.

(sighs)

08:43.958 --> 08:45.958
(railway crossing bells clanging)

08:47.833 --> 08:49.833
Tell your cousin

08:49.916 --> 08:52.458
I said you can ride the fucking bike.

08:52.541 --> 08:55.250
It's not his fucking bike anyway.

08:55.333 --> 08:58.416
It's a house bike.
I took that bike out of the dump

08:58.500 --> 09:00.416
and fixed it up
for all you little assholes.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.833
Now they're moving to Colorado.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.791
It's your bike anyway.

09:03.875 --> 09:06.583
(sighing):
Oh, Jesus, mother of God.

09:06.666 --> 09:08.291
How did you get sick?

09:08.375 --> 09:10.250
I'm not sick.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.708
It's Saturday morning.

09:12.791 --> 09:15.541
This is the way it is.

09:15.625 --> 09:19.541
This is Saturday morning
in the life of men.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.333
Oh.

09:21.416 --> 09:23.916
Go around to the bar.
Get me a pack of cigarettes.

09:25.291 --> 09:27.291
(phone ringing)

09:29.166 --> 09:31.625
Get that before your grandmother does.

09:31.708 --> 09:34.375
I'm-I'm not here. Whoever...

09:34.458 --> 09:36.625
-Hello?
-Hey.

09:36.708 --> 09:40.500
Now, I know there are a lot
of rug rats running around,

09:40.583 --> 09:43.458
but I'm wondering if this is JR.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.791
Dad?

09:44.875 --> 09:45.916
Huh? What?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.500
That's right, buddy, if this is JR...

09:47.583 --> 09:49.541
Give me the fucking phone.

09:49.625 --> 09:51.500
-...I'm your father.
-Mom's not here.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.416
Well, I'm not calling
for your mother, kiddo.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.666
I'm calling for you.

09:54.750 --> 09:57.208
Hey, uh...

09:57.291 --> 09:59.791
How would you like to see
a ball game with your old man?

09:59.875 --> 10:03.125
-Really?
-Sure. Ball game with your old man.

10:03.208 --> 10:05.000
Mets or Yankees?

10:05.083 --> 10:06.541
Whatever you like.

10:06.625 --> 10:08.791
Uncle Charlie says
the Yankees are assholes,

10:08.875 --> 10:10.791
but the Mets drink at The Dickens.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.541
How is your Uncle Charlie?

10:13.625 --> 10:15.208
How are you? He wants to know.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.125
I'm still short 30 bucks.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.208
Tell him the Mets play the Braves
tomorrow night.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.458
Mets play the Braves tomorrow night.

10:25.541 --> 10:26.916
Doesn't mean he's gonna show up.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.958
Well, I will tell you what, sport.

10:29.041 --> 10:30.916
I'll get a couple tickets. (clears throat)

10:31.000 --> 10:33.333
And I will pick you up
at your grandfather's at30.

10:33.416 --> 10:34.791
Great. Thank you.

10:34.875 --> 10:37.083
We got a lot
to catch up on, you and me.

10:37.166 --> 10:38.291
Okay.

10:38.375 --> 10:40.166
-Bye, now.
-Bye.

10:42.666 --> 10:44.291
You gonna get my cigarettes?

10:44.375 --> 10:45.541
Oh.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.000
Are you reading this paper?

10:49.083 --> 10:50.500
-Oh, no.
-Great.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.333
(chuckles softly)

10:59.416 --> 11:01.708
I... I got an interview at Yale.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.583
(chuckles)

11:16.708 --> 11:18.708
He said to be ready at- 30.

11:18.791 --> 11:22.250
I was ready at30 so as not to fuck up.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.333
You always remember fucking up,
so you don't want to.

11:26.833 --> 11:30.666
The thing is, that day, I felt like I had.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.875
That's the thing to remember about a kid.

11:32.958 --> 11:35.500
The kid always thinks he fucked up.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.500
I didn't know what he looked like.

11:38.583 --> 11:42.208
I hadn't been to New York City
to see his face on billboards and buses.

11:42.291 --> 11:44.708
I couldn't have picked him out of a crowd.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.916
But I wondered if it was like
a thing you would always know,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.791
as if you would always know
your father instantly.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.375
It was possible.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.791

12:09.500 --> 12:11.333

12:13.041 --> 12:15.458
A little while later,
after being arrested while on air

12:15.541 --> 12:18.333
for nonpayment of child support,

12:18.416 --> 12:20.333
The Voice fled the state.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.291
It was about this same period
that he called up drunk

12:24.375 --> 12:27.416
and said he put a contract
on my mother's life.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.083
He also threatened to kidnap me,

12:29.166 --> 12:31.708
but Uncle Charlie thought
this was a less serious threat,

12:31.791 --> 12:34.333
as kidnapping comes with responsibilities.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.875
We're the Two Musketeers, right?

12:40.500 --> 12:41.833
Yeah.

12:48.708 --> 12:50.708

12:50.791 --> 12:53.666
This is the male sciences, all right?

12:53.750 --> 12:55.416
You get your drink.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.208
That goes there.

12:57.291 --> 12:59.833
Got your pack of butts, right?

12:59.916 --> 13:01.708
That goes there.

13:01.791 --> 13:03.833
See that? Look at...
look at this guy right there.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.333
See how he's putting his money
in his pocket like that?

13:06.416 --> 13:07.583
-Yeah.
-Never do that.

13:07.666 --> 13:09.333
That's keeping your money like a drunk.

13:09.416 --> 13:10.625
It's not correct.

13:10.708 --> 13:13.125
Know what you also do?

13:13.208 --> 13:14.958
You take care of your mother.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.916
All right?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.458
All right, give me a hand.

13:18.541 --> 13:21.666
And you take care of,
if you have one, your woman.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.708
If you drink, you keep your shit together.

13:23.791 --> 13:25.833
If your shit's not together,
you don't drink.

13:25.916 --> 13:27.791
Don't be like one of these assholes here
who acts like

13:27.875 --> 13:29.958
it was Jesus who came down
and made him late for work

13:30.041 --> 13:31.833
and spend all their money and throw back

in your wallet, right?

That's like a hundred bucks,
five, whatever,

13:51.291 --> 13:53.250
depending on the economy.

13:53.333 --> 13:57.500
Important thing is you never,
ever drink that money, right?

13:57.583 --> 13:59.500
What else? Hold doors.

13:59.583 --> 14:01.083
Be good to your mother.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.375
Teach you how to change a tire,
jump a car.

14:03.458 --> 14:04.750
You know, that's it.

14:04.833 --> 14:07.708
Change a tire, jump a car, take care
of your mother, don't drink your stashies.

14:07.791 --> 14:11.000
Oh, one more thing-- very important.

14:11.083 --> 14:14.250
Never under any circumstances hit a woman,

14:14.333 --> 14:16.791
even if she stabs you with scissors.

14:16.875 --> 14:17.916
Got it.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.708
That's it. Male sciences. Right.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.708
Can people read those books?

14:23.791 --> 14:25.875
Can they read...

14:25.958 --> 14:27.583
What are you, soft?

14:27.666 --> 14:29.041
No, I mean, can I read them?

14:29.125 --> 14:30.416
What's the name of this place?

14:30.500 --> 14:31.750
The Dickens.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.666
That's right.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.458
Charles Dickens. You know who that is?

14:37.541 --> 14:39.083
-The owner?
-(chuckles)

14:40.166 --> 14:42.208
Yes, you can read 'em.
You can read as many as you like.

14:42.291 --> 14:43.833
Take 'em in the poker room. Read 'em all.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.541
Fill yourself up.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.458
And you know what might happen?

14:47.541 --> 14:51.166
If you read enough books,
maybe, if you're lucky,

14:51.250 --> 14:53.458
you could become a writer.

14:54.791 --> 14:56.541
And that was it.

14:56.625 --> 15:00.083
From that moment on,
I wanted to be a writer.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.333
(jingle playing over radio)

15:01.416 --> 15:04.083
GRANDPA (singing along):

15:07.291 --> 15:09.333
Apricots.

15:10.416 --> 15:13.250
-(passes gas)
-Ah. I didn't do that.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.250
Your grandfather has
a photographic memory.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.000
He knows Greek and Latin.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.750
But here is this-- the furniture is
held together with duct tape,

15:21.833 --> 15:24.250
and he's doing this--
he's farting and saying he didn't do it,

15:24.333 --> 15:27.208
saying "apricots" for no reason.

15:27.291 --> 15:29.041
That's what he did with going to college.

15:29.125 --> 15:31.958
And yet you all end up back here.

15:32.041 --> 15:34.750
You are a stingy, crazy, old bastard.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.125
You are not stingy with money.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.416
Haven't got any.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.875
-You are stingy with love.
-(passes gas)

15:40.958 --> 15:42.500
I didn't do that.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.708
Girls become wives and mothers.
That was his point of view.

15:44.791 --> 15:47.458
-You became one of them.
-Oh, shut up, you old turd!

15:47.541 --> 15:49.458
-(scoffs)
-Because he is stingy

15:49.541 --> 15:52.083
with love and understanding,
that is why I have no education,

15:52.166 --> 15:54.166
and that is why you--

15:54.250 --> 15:57.333
I swear to God, I have no idea how--

15:57.416 --> 15:59.750
you are going to Harvard or Yale.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.708
-(passes gas)
-I didn't do that.

16:01.791 --> 16:03.458
You are going to Harvard or Yale.

16:03.541 --> 16:05.125
Make up for your disappointments?

16:05.208 --> 16:07.125
-Harvard or Yale.
-This from a woman

16:07.208 --> 16:09.333
who earns 30 bucks a day.

16:09.416 --> 16:13.083
And after college-- at Harvard or Yale!--

16:13.166 --> 16:15.250
you are going to law school.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.833
So you can sue your father
for child support.

16:17.916 --> 16:20.833
No, so he can help you
with your fines about the septic tank.

16:20.916 --> 16:22.666
(passes gas)

16:27.791 --> 16:29.291
(engine shuts off)

16:29.375 --> 16:31.000
(door opens)

16:32.500 --> 16:34.125
(door closes)

16:47.875 --> 16:51.958
Fregosi is the hitter
facing the right-hander Jenkins.

16:52.041 --> 16:53.833
Infield playing in.

16:53.916 --> 16:55.416
Here comes the pitch.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.416
Fastball is in there for a strike,
and it's two and two.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.166
(chuckles, mutters)
What the fuck is this?

17:01.250 --> 17:03.708
Hey, Charlie. How's it hanging?

17:03.791 --> 17:05.125
Still got the clap, asshole?

17:05.208 --> 17:06.875
You know I got it from your sister.

17:06.958 --> 17:09.583
-Where's my 30 bucks?
-It's up my ass. Come get it.

17:09.666 --> 17:11.833
JR, say hi to your father.

17:11.916 --> 17:14.750
Jenkins sets, looks in and delivers.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.958
-Swing and a miss! Strike three.
-(car door closes)

17:17.041 --> 17:19.125
-And away we go.
-(engine starts)

17:19.208 --> 17:20.833
("A Long Time Ago" by Jim Croce playing)

17:37.958 --> 17:40.375
You like living
at your grandfather's house?

17:40.458 --> 17:41.625
Yeah.

17:41.708 --> 17:43.833
I mean... no.

17:46.208 --> 17:47.416
Yes or no?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.833
I mean, I like it, but Mom doesn't.

17:51.291 --> 17:54.458
Well, I think your grandfather
is a good man.

17:54.541 --> 17:58.541
Marches to his own drummer,
but that's what I like about him.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.958
Mom says he might have lost his mind.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.166
Well, there's that, too.
Sometimes your own drummer is a bad idea.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.250
It makes Mom sad having to keep
going to Grandpa's house.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.458
She blame me?

18:25.166 --> 18:27.208
See, the thing about women...

18:29.500 --> 18:33.375
Sometimes they don't think about
the cause and effect of things.

18:33.458 --> 18:36.125
They want freedom,

18:36.208 --> 18:40.416
but then they blame you
for dispensing it once they get it.

18:41.791 --> 18:44.125
At least that's my experience.

18:44.208 --> 18:47.250
One swinging dick to another.
I'll give you that one.

18:49.875 --> 18:54.333
Hey, your mom tells me you listen
to your old man on the radio a lot.

18:54.416 --> 18:57.458
She says I listen too much
or try to find you.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.166
-You change stations a lot.
-(chuckles)

19:01.250 --> 19:03.458
That's the management.

19:03.541 --> 19:06.041
You want to be a disc jockey
when you grow up?

19:06.125 --> 19:08.458
-I'm gonna be a lawyer.
-Jesus. Why?

19:08.541 --> 19:10.208
Mom wants me to.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.166
Talk a lot of shit and believe anything.

19:16.625 --> 19:18.958
All right.

19:19.041 --> 19:21.000
Good to see you, young man.

19:22.750 --> 19:26.041
-I got a barbecue meeting with a sponsor.
-(music stops)

19:26.125 --> 19:27.875
-Can I come?
-Nope.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.958
Tell your mother not to spend that all
in one place.

19:36.250 --> 19:40.541
As for you, keep listening to the radio.

19:40.625 --> 19:43.333
See you soon, Junior.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.166
A doctor at school says
I have no identity.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.666
Jesus. (laughs)

19:47.750 --> 19:49.000
Get one.

19:49.083 --> 19:50.916
I'll see you on the flip side.

19:57.958 --> 19:59.375
See ya.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.250
Hey, asshole.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.625
Good day with the kid?

20:08.708 --> 20:10.916
Fuck you, Charlie.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.916
Give me my 30 bucks
or get the fuck out of the car.

20:15.708 --> 20:17.333
Hey, don't be a fucking... You know what?

20:17.416 --> 20:19.208
Don't be trying to be
a fucking tough guy, all right?

20:19.291 --> 20:20.958
(grunts)

20:21.041 --> 20:23.125
Why'd you marry him?

20:23.208 --> 20:24.791
I was young.

20:25.875 --> 20:27.875
I was dumb.

20:27.958 --> 20:30.125
I don't want to be a junior.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.416
I don't want to have the same name.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.916
(Mom sniffles)

20:39.750 --> 20:42.458
You can have any name you want.

20:42.541 --> 20:45.083
("Magic" by Pilot playing)

20:45.166 --> 20:47.541
Who was the guy
pitched a no-hitter on acid?

20:47.625 --> 20:49.083
-- Dock Ellis.
-- You can take acid,

20:49.166 --> 20:51.166
you can take fucking Drano.
You know what I'm saying?

20:51.250 --> 20:52.916
But you commit. You make a decision.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.583
You shit or wind your watch.

20:54.666 --> 20:58.500
You fucking call it a day
or run for president, and that's it.

21:04.166 --> 21:06.083
What do you need me to do?

21:06.166 --> 21:08.958
-(sighs) Mom can't go to something.
-Oh.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.583
I mean, what can't she go to?

21:10.666 --> 21:12.208
Where we going?

21:15.833 --> 21:18.375
Sorry to make you wait.

21:18.458 --> 21:21.375
(sighs) How can I help?

21:21.458 --> 21:23.375
Uh, well, I'm not sure.

21:23.458 --> 21:27.708
Uh, someone said he was having,
uh, tantrums.

21:27.791 --> 21:29.833
Maybe you said that.

21:29.916 --> 21:32.583
His mother's a secretary.
She's busy. She's not here, so I came.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.208
Maybe you can tell me
what this is all about.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.500
The boy won't tell me
what his name stands for.

21:37.583 --> 21:39.875
Doesn't stand for anything.
His name is JR.

21:39.958 --> 21:41.541
Deal with it.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.291
(chuckles softly)

21:50.125 --> 21:54.083
Maybe this is a weird time for me
to tell you that I'm not a psychologist.

21:54.166 --> 21:55.333
Why do you say that?

21:55.416 --> 21:57.083
Well, because I'm not a psychologist

21:57.166 --> 21:59.750
and I'm sitting here with somebody
who actually is a psychologist

21:59.833 --> 22:01.375
who maybe knows I'm not a psychologist.

22:01.458 --> 22:03.083
What are you, fucking inert?

22:09.041 --> 22:10.958
(chuckles) All right.

22:11.041 --> 22:13.458
This is your thing?

22:13.541 --> 22:16.875
Nothing is face value,
and you're the smartest guy in the room,

22:16.958 --> 22:20.875
and you sit there looking for errors
in baseline perception.

22:20.958 --> 22:22.833
Oh, yeah. We all have our jobs.

22:22.916 --> 22:24.958
You have yours. Knock yourself out.

22:25.041 --> 22:26.333
JR-- those are his initials?

22:26.416 --> 22:28.125
Or it's the contraction for "junior."

22:28.208 --> 22:29.541
What fucking difference does it make?

22:29.625 --> 22:32.208
Well, there's a very big difference
if it is being concealed from him

22:32.291 --> 22:34.666
that he's a junior
because there is no senior in his life.

22:34.750 --> 22:37.041
That may never
have occurred to him until you just

22:37.125 --> 22:40.958
laid your line of bullshit
on the subject to him right to his face.

22:41.041 --> 22:45.291
It is my belief that the uncertainty
about the meaning of his name

22:45.375 --> 22:48.541
and the continual questions about it
have left him without identity.

22:48.625 --> 22:52.500
Very impressive.
No identity, hence identity crisis.

22:52.583 --> 22:55.083
He has no identity, which causes rage.

22:55.166 --> 22:59.041
He has dubiety
about his identity, possibly.

23:00.125 --> 23:03.708
How sure are you about your identity? Hmm?

23:03.791 --> 23:06.791
I'm curious because
you seem very interested

23:06.875 --> 23:08.958
in his father and his absence,

23:09.041 --> 23:11.666
and you cast it
in this very negative light

23:11.750 --> 23:15.000
and bring the kid in here
and you're traumatizing him.

23:15.083 --> 23:18.500
We both know you're calling his mother up
and asking her out on dates.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.750
Um, that's...

23:23.833 --> 23:25.833
So you're willing to traumatize
a little kid

23:25.916 --> 23:27.875
in order to hit on his mother?

23:30.416 --> 23:33.291
Uncle Charlie never had
the money to go to college.

23:33.375 --> 23:35.083
He was self-taught.

23:35.166 --> 23:39.041
But that didn't mean some dime-store
fifth-grade shrink could go toe to toe.

23:39.125 --> 23:40.250
(typewriter bell dings)

23:40.333 --> 23:42.333
(clock ticking)

23:47.541 --> 23:50.291
(sighs) The Family Gazette.

23:52.833 --> 23:55.000
This is great, JR.

24:10.958 --> 24:12.958
(sighs)

24:16.250 --> 24:17.916
(lighter flicks)

24:18.000 --> 24:20.291
Okay.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.208
Here it is.

24:22.291 --> 24:25.041
Lose the drawings. Just get rid of 'em.

24:25.125 --> 24:27.750
I know a lot of guys
that think they're writers,

24:27.833 --> 24:30.500
and you'll find in life
that most of them are not.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.458
Here's the thing.

24:33.541 --> 24:35.833
You got to have "it."

24:35.916 --> 24:40.458
I don't know what it is,
but if you don't have it immediately...

24:42.125 --> 24:43.916
...you never get it.

24:50.041 --> 24:51.666
And I say you got it.

24:51.750 --> 24:54.166
Oh. I knew it.

24:54.250 --> 24:55.541
Oh, I knew it! I knew it.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.750
There's-there's... there's something.

24:57.833 --> 24:59.708
Calm down. I didn't say you were good.

24:59.791 --> 25:02.000
I said, you know, you could be.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.083
Come here. Come with me.

25:05.375 --> 25:06.500
(door slides open)

25:06.583 --> 25:10.250
Now, what you do is you read all of those.

25:11.708 --> 25:14.708
Now, I don't want to talk to you
unless you read all those.

25:14.791 --> 25:17.250
I also don't want to talk to you
about all those.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.625
So, Yale interview?

25:27.708 --> 25:29.583
(chuckles) Yeah.

25:30.666 --> 25:32.833
Your mother must be thrilled.

25:32.916 --> 25:34.708
(laughs)

25:34.791 --> 25:37.500
Yeah, you know, it's all she ever wanted.

25:37.583 --> 25:41.416
In my official capacity,
I have to say, is the only thing

25:41.500 --> 25:43.875
to concentrate on in this world

25:43.958 --> 25:47.125
is the desire to see
the face of God the Father.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.750
Right.

25:49.833 --> 25:52.375
However, the Church is on her last legs.

25:52.458 --> 25:55.375
Three people come to my mass.

25:56.625 --> 25:59.541
I had four, but Mrs. Cafferty took a fall

25:59.625 --> 26:02.291
because she didn't have a good son.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.000
Be a good son.

26:05.083 --> 26:06.708
(chuckles softly)

26:06.791 --> 26:08.583
That's why I'm going to the interview.

26:08.666 --> 26:12.083
Now, tell me, when was the last time
you made a good confession?

26:12.166 --> 26:14.250
("Turn Back the Hands of Time"
by Tyrone Davis playing)

26:14.333 --> 26:15.958
Not in my Yale essay.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.000
Well, you want to get in.

26:18.083 --> 26:20.166
(chuckles) Right.

26:22.333 --> 26:23.958
Hey. Whose kid is that?

26:24.041 --> 26:25.958
My sister's.

26:26.041 --> 26:28.291
Which sister?
The hot one or the crazy one?

26:28.375 --> 26:30.500
What, are you fucking stupid?
You want to die?

26:30.583 --> 26:32.291
(laughing)

26:35.666 --> 26:37.416
Hey, get that kid a drink on me.

26:38.583 --> 26:42.291
Oh, you're backed up on Bobo.

26:42.375 --> 26:45.708
You know, I got a feeling that, uh,
you had a reason to come down here.

26:45.791 --> 26:47.166
You didn't just come down here
to come here.

26:47.250 --> 26:49.750
Maybe you forgot.

26:49.833 --> 26:52.083
Grandpa needs a pack of Old Golds.

26:52.166 --> 26:54.875
Never keep somebody away
from their cigarettes.

26:54.958 --> 26:57.125
Poor old guy's probably
climbing the walls.

26:57.208 --> 27:00.291
Well, you know he's gonna be back in here
saying weird shit. Here you go.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.833
I want to back up Bobo.

27:07.916 --> 27:10.333
(light laughter)

27:10.416 --> 27:12.250
With your grandfather's money?

27:12.333 --> 27:13.333
Yeah.

27:14.583 --> 27:16.041
All right.

27:16.125 --> 27:19.166
-Bobo, you're backed up on the kid.
-This kid's all right.

27:20.916 --> 27:23.125
Today, we're gonna take a break
from our studies,

27:23.208 --> 27:25.166
and we're gonna make invitations.

27:25.250 --> 27:29.041
Handmade invitations for
the father-and-son breakfast.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.666
All right, so you're gonna make
your own invitations.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.916
You're gonna bring 'em home
to your fathers after school.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.583
Saturday morning,
we're gonna cook them breakfast,

27:38.666 --> 27:41.500
and you're gonna read to them
from your schoolwork,

27:41.583 --> 27:43.541
so everybody gets to know
each other better.

27:43.625 --> 27:47.916
All right, and I want you to do things
that you do with your dad, all right?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.625
Who needs a scissor? Who needs,
like, a colored pencil or something?

27:50.708 --> 27:53.500
Hold on a sec. Let me get those.

27:53.583 --> 27:56.041
All right? Got that?

27:56.125 --> 27:57.625
(school bell ringing)

27:57.708 --> 28:00.666
All right, guys,
put invitations on my desk.

28:00.750 --> 28:03.250
Thank you, Michael, Stephen.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.041
Adam, excellent.

28:05.125 --> 28:06.666
I love that.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.333
All right.

28:11.416 --> 28:12.875
What is it, JR?

28:12.958 --> 28:14.416
I don't have a father.

28:15.500 --> 28:18.083
Oh. Did he pass on?

28:18.166 --> 28:19.791
I don't know. Maybe.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.541
I just don't have one.

28:21.625 --> 28:22.958
"Passing on" means dead.

28:23.041 --> 28:24.916
Oh. No, he's not dead.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.458
He's on the radio.

28:26.541 --> 28:29.250
Can I just not come to the breakfast?

28:30.291 --> 28:32.208
You know what, I'm gonna call your mother.

28:32.291 --> 28:34.708
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:34.791 --> 28:37.208
Don't they know
the way the world is today?

28:37.291 --> 28:40.958
It's hard to tell people
about your father, JR, because...

28:41.041 --> 28:43.208
it's hard to know where to begin.

28:43.291 --> 28:45.083
Maybe the police can make him go?

28:45.166 --> 28:48.708
-(Mom laughs)
-Police can't make him pay support.

28:48.791 --> 28:51.916
A father-son breakfast might be tough.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.083
Well, why don't you take him,
you son of a bitch?

28:57.083 --> 28:58.500
Ah.

28:59.625 --> 29:02.250
Why not? Why not?

29:02.333 --> 29:04.208
(chuckles)
Oh, you're gonna take him?

29:06.625 --> 29:09.250
("Two of a Kind" by Bobby Darin
& Johnny Mercer playing)

29:43.458 --> 29:45.208
You two look so handsome.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.916
I remember you.

30:07.458 --> 30:10.625
Let's go, before I change my mind.

30:13.291 --> 30:15.125
You have fun.

30:15.208 --> 30:16.916

-(breath shuddering)

30:21.083 --> 30:22.541
Oh, here we go.

30:59.875 --> 31:03.166
Our educational system, and indeed

31:03.250 --> 31:05.375
our society as a whole,

31:05.458 --> 31:09.958
was destroyed in the 19th century
by the German influence.

31:10.041 --> 31:11.333
Really?

31:11.416 --> 31:17.208
Ability as a concept, turned into
a mechanical, empirical construct.

31:17.291 --> 31:20.875
You may be a beneficiary of this system.

31:20.958 --> 31:25.458
Regardless of the system in place,

31:29.875 --> 31:32.208
on his own abilities. Hmm?

31:42.625 --> 31:44.291
Thank you for taking me.

31:44.375 --> 31:46.333
Aw.

31:46.416 --> 31:49.083
Don't tell anybody I'm a good grandfather.

31:49.166 --> 31:51.625
-Everybody will want one.
-(laughs)

31:54.166 --> 31:59.333
Your mother has a tumor on her thyroid

31:59.416 --> 32:01.666
and is going to have it out.

32:02.750 --> 32:05.791
It might be malignant, hmm?

32:08.375 --> 32:09.625
Be nice to her.

32:10.791 --> 32:12.416
Okay.

32:12.500 --> 32:15.125
("My Opening Farewell"
by Jackson Browne playing)

32:18.083 --> 32:20.916
The biopsy proved
the tumor was malignant,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.916
so they cut it out,
along with her thyroid.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.791
No chemo, no radiation.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.916
They just cut it out,
and the cancer was gone.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.375
Sounds easier than it was.

32:32.458 --> 32:35.208
Nothing in my mom's life came easy.

Do you want some water?

33:14.833 --> 33:17.541
I want you to succeed.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.458
What if I can't?

33:22.375 --> 33:26.916
As God is my witness,

33:27.000 --> 33:32.625
you are going to Yale.

33:36.291 --> 33:38.250
It's gonna cost $11,000.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.250
Yeah? Who says?

33:40.333 --> 33:41.958
Grandpa.

33:42.041 --> 33:43.833
(Mom scoffs)

33:46.250 --> 33:48.458
You mind if your mama believes in you?

33:50.708 --> 33:52.125
No.

33:53.166 --> 33:55.166
Something's wrong with my brain today.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.333
Wordy Gurdy has me stumped.

33:57.416 --> 33:59.333
What's Wordy Gurdy?

33:59.416 --> 34:00.833
It's a puzzle.

34:00.916 --> 34:04.083
They give you this half-assed clue,
and the answers rhyme.

34:04.166 --> 34:07.250
Like, uh... "Jane's vehicles"

34:07.333 --> 34:09.833
is, you know, "Fonda's Hondas."

34:09.916 --> 34:12.375

34:14.833 --> 34:17.458

"Richard's ingredients"?

35:19.416 --> 35:20.916
All right, one more.

-Who else is coming?
-Pat.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.041
-Who's he?
-She.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.541
Your uncle's girlfriend.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.416
Ah, we all make mistakes.

-Where do you think you're going?
-It's fucking Wednesday!

I go fucking bowling
every fucking Wednesday! Fuck you!

35:35.000 --> 35:37.125

Fuck you!

hanging out with these bums?

35:59.791 --> 36:02.291
I get to go bowling
'cause I did the Wordy Gurdy.

36:02.375 --> 36:04.791
Aw, you must be the apple
of your mother's eye.

36:04.875 --> 36:06.750
I hope so, 'cause she's sad.

such a dick about it.

kind of thing, you know?

the first inkblot on her ledger.

41:41.375 --> 41:42.791
No.

41:44.416 --> 41:45.833
Okay.

41:53.500 --> 41:55.125
I'll come home a lot.

41:57.541 --> 41:59.250
Yeah, this isn't home.

41:59.333 --> 42:00.958
(chuckles)

42:01.041 --> 42:02.666
-Yeah, it is.
-No.

42:03.875 --> 42:05.750
-No, it's not.
-(door opens)

42:08.958 --> 42:10.625
-Okay, go.
-(door closes)

42:10.708 --> 42:13.291
-Go. Go, go, go, go.
-(engine starts)

42:13.375 --> 42:14.791
Go.

42:23.916 --> 42:26.791
("Modern Life" by Devo playing)

42:34.416 --> 42:36.125
-How's it going?
-Hey.

42:36.208 --> 42:38.208
(indistinct chatter)

42:54.125 --> 42:56.916
(fading):

43:03.250 --> 43:04.875
-Hi.
-Hey.

43:04.958 --> 43:06.625
-Hey, I'm Jimmy.
-JR.

43:06.708 --> 43:08.166
Oh. Well, what does JR stand for?

43:08.250 --> 43:09.833
-Jackie Robinson.
-Really?

43:09.916 --> 43:11.541
Nah, it's "Junior."

43:11.625 --> 43:13.708
I was expecting a kind of
Brideshead Revisited thing.

43:13.791 --> 43:15.250
This is bullshit.

43:15.333 --> 43:17.125
-This taken?
-JR andNo.

43:17.208 --> 43:19.166
-I'm Wesley.
-I'm Jimmy.

43:19.250 --> 43:20.500
Jimmy? Jim's good.

43:20.583 --> 43:22.875
-JR.
-JR. What does that stand for?

43:22.958 --> 43:25.791
-Jackie Robinson.
-No shit.

43:25.875 --> 43:27.541
No, it's "Junior."

43:27.625 --> 43:28.666
All right.

43:28.750 --> 43:30.166
Junior, JR.

43:30.250 --> 43:32.125
Jimmy, Jim.

43:32.208 --> 43:33.916
It's our first night at Yale.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.166
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

43:36.250 --> 43:38.666
Let's get fucked-up.

43:38.750 --> 43:40.750
(Jimmy chuckles)

43:40.833 --> 43:42.916
You will be making the acquaintance

43:43.000 --> 43:45.041
of Satan.

43:45.125 --> 43:47.250
Not in your own worst impulses

43:47.333 --> 43:49.625
or among your friends--

43:49.708 --> 43:53.041
though you will, in each case--

43:53.125 --> 43:55.375
but in Paradise Lost.

43:57.166 --> 44:01.500
For the time being, in this class,
though I beat against barbarous current,

44:01.583 --> 44:03.958
I still teach Western literature,

44:04.041 --> 44:09.291
in which everything derives
from two epic poems,

44:09.375 --> 44:12.291
the Iliad and the Odyssey,

44:12.375 --> 44:15.833
handily contained for you in one book,

44:15.916 --> 44:18.750
edited and translated by me.

44:20.291 --> 44:24.041
The Iliad and the Odyssey
are the two seedlings,

44:24.125 --> 44:27.416
the "poyims" 3,000 years old...

44:27.500 --> 44:28.958
What's a "poyim"?

44:29.041 --> 44:31.041
Somebody who's not Jewish.

44:31.125 --> 44:33.208
The Iliad and the Odyssey are universal.

44:33.291 --> 44:35.958
They are stories about going home.

44:37.291 --> 44:40.541
You will start by reading half the Iliad

44:40.625 --> 44:42.916
and write me a ten-page paper.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.375
Any questions? Yes.

44:45.458 --> 44:47.541
Uh, a paper on what?

44:47.625 --> 44:49.333
The first half of the Iliad.

44:50.375 --> 44:52.041
No, right, but on what subject?

44:52.125 --> 44:55.375
The first half of the Iliad.

44:56.708 --> 44:58.791
He's throwing down.

44:58.875 --> 45:02.583
Now, as some of you hopefully may know,

45:02.666 --> 45:06.791
the Iliad is an ancient Greek epic poem
in dactylic hexameter...

45:06.875 --> 45:08.000
-Hey.
-Hmm?

45:08.083 --> 45:09.375
-Who is that?
-Who?

45:09.458 --> 45:10.791
In the purple.

45:11.875 --> 45:14.000
-- Ah. She goes out with Stinky.
-- Stinky?

45:14.083 --> 45:15.416
Yeah, he's wealthy.

45:15.500 --> 45:17.958
...grand style
of Western classical poetry.

45:18.041 --> 45:21.375
So take note of these
and other examples of its use

45:21.458 --> 45:23.958
as you make your way through the text.

45:24.041 --> 45:25.458
Ovid's Metamorphos...

45:25.541 --> 45:27.541
(crickets chirping)

45:28.583 --> 45:30.958
Because everything I see is unattainable.

45:31.041 --> 45:33.000
That's because you're probably
being a pussy.

45:33.083 --> 45:34.708
Well, if you're made to read
the greatest things ever written,

45:34.791 --> 45:36.291
that you couldn't do,
and make you feel like shit,

45:36.375 --> 45:37.916
then how are you supposed
to become a writer?

45:38.000 --> 45:40.291
Socrates says you learn more
from a bad book than a good one.

45:40.375 --> 45:42.958
Aristotle. I think.

45:43.041 --> 45:45.416
If you go to Yale
but you don't have any balls,

45:45.500 --> 45:47.333
how are you supposed
to be a student at Yale?

45:47.416 --> 45:50.041
I'm just here on a lucky break.
It's just a lucky break.

45:50.125 --> 45:52.750
I mean, I can do Wordy Gurdy all day long,

45:52.833 --> 45:56.125
but I cannot figure out what the fuck
they are saying in Henry V.

45:56.208 --> 45:58.958
We're all here on a lucky break,
douchebag.

45:59.041 --> 46:01.791
I'm Lucky Sperm Club, and no one's
ever noticed that I'm an idiot.

46:01.875 --> 46:03.500
It's also luck. Everybody's lucky.

46:03.583 --> 46:06.250
Everybody alive is lucky

46:06.333 --> 46:08.041
and were descended from the lucky.

46:08.125 --> 46:10.833
Our ancestors were all either fast, smart

46:10.916 --> 46:13.333
or had really fucking good immune systems.

46:13.416 --> 46:16.750
Luck, asshole-- it's why we're all here.

46:17.750 --> 46:20.208
Hmm. I never thought about it like that.

46:20.291 --> 46:23.083
You see, you're believing
in society's bullshit interpretation

46:23.166 --> 46:26.416
of you and everything else,
and that is why you can't write.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.583
Not because Homer
makes you think you suck.

46:28.666 --> 46:30.500
(chuckles softly)

46:30.583 --> 46:32.625
I'd really like for you
to meet my Uncle Charlie.

46:32.708 --> 46:35.000
What's he do?

46:35.083 --> 46:37.333
He runs a bar.

46:37.416 --> 46:39.416
I would really like to meet
your Uncle Charlie.

46:39.500 --> 46:41.500
("Dynaflow" by Parish Hall playing)

-You got your I.D.'s, right?

Hey! The fuck are you guys doing here?

46:54.833 --> 46:57.750

What about these rejects?

47:02.833 --> 47:05.333
Hmm. Okay.

47:05.416 --> 47:07.666
Well, welcome to our shores, Jim.

47:07.750 --> 47:09.666
Hey, I got an announcement.

47:09.750 --> 47:11.416
-(bell jingling)
-Everybody,

47:11.500 --> 47:14.541
according to the laws
of the sovereign state of New York,

47:14.625 --> 47:16.708
today, my nephew is officially a man.

47:16.791 --> 47:18.750
And so are his friends legally men.

47:18.833 --> 47:21.250
-The law is fucked!
-Get these assholes a drink on me.

47:21.333 --> 47:23.500
Fuck you. First one is mine.

47:23.583 --> 47:25.083
Mine.

47:25.166 --> 47:26.833
Then you guys are backed up on Joey D.

47:26.916 --> 47:29.208
-What do you want?
-Wow. Uh...

47:29.291 --> 47:31.750
Well, I don't even know what to have.

47:31.833 --> 47:34.166
I think a Yale man
should drink gin myself,

47:34.250 --> 47:36.291
but... big decision, Chief.

47:36.375 --> 47:38.583
Whatever you assholes choose now
is what I'm gonna pour

47:38.666 --> 47:41.000
every time you walk in the door-- forever.

47:42.083 --> 47:44.125
But you got to have a drink-- your drink.

47:44.208 --> 47:45.833
(sighs) Gin makes me crazy.

47:45.916 --> 47:47.541
We can handle that.
We can handle anything.

47:47.625 --> 47:49.291
I make an excellent gin martini.

47:49.375 --> 47:51.083
The secret is a few drops of Scotch.

47:51.166 --> 47:52.875
Come on, Chaz, back 'em up on me.

47:52.958 --> 47:54.750
Back 'em up on me, too, Charlie.

47:54.833 --> 47:59.000
Goodness. Evidently, tonight, you guys
are backed up on Chief and Joey D.

47:59.083 --> 48:00.958
Fasten your fucking seat belt.

48:03.041 --> 48:05.291
(horns honking)

48:05.375 --> 48:06.583
So you went to war?

48:06.666 --> 48:08.000
'Nam, Second Division.

48:08.083 --> 48:10.375
Quang Tri, '67 to '69.

48:10.458 --> 48:13.041
You little fuckers
will never know such things.

48:13.125 --> 48:17.625
All props to the 82nd, but your little
fucking airdrop on Grenada is not a war.

48:17.708 --> 48:20.500
-We didn't airdrop on Grenada.
-How long were you in the Army?

48:20.583 --> 48:22.708
One year, seven months, five days.

48:22.791 --> 48:24.000
How long were you in Vietnam?

48:24.083 --> 48:25.208
11 months, 12 days.

48:25.291 --> 48:27.916
Chaz says you're insecure at Yale.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.708
Nah. No.

48:29.791 --> 48:32.375
Well, hey, it's the same as prison.

48:32.458 --> 48:34.166
Anywhere is the same as prison.

48:34.250 --> 48:36.833
You need to find the main guy,
who's a problem,

48:36.916 --> 48:38.375
and you rip his fucking lungs out.

48:38.458 --> 48:40.375
The fuck you telling the kid that for?

48:40.458 --> 48:42.875
-That's it.
-He's going to Yale, not Rahway.

48:44.083 --> 48:48.041
You know, Uncle Charlie is, like,
your old man, basically.

48:48.125 --> 48:50.333
No, he's my Uncle Charlie.

48:50.416 --> 48:52.458
My old man's in a radio.

48:52.541 --> 48:54.375
Your old man's in a radio?

49:00.083 --> 49:02.291
What are you reading this weekend?

49:02.375 --> 49:03.916
Aquinas.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.708
Oh, Jesus Christ.

49:06.791 --> 49:08.916
What? Thomas Aquinas.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.250
Needed to believe there was a God,
so he offered the world concrete proof.

49:13.333 --> 49:17.250
If you didn't believe his concrete proof,
the Church would cut your nuts off.

49:17.333 --> 49:18.958
-What are you worried about?
-I don't wanna.

49:19.041 --> 49:20.541
You don't wanna.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.375
This is when you push.

49:22.458 --> 49:23.833
Right now.

49:23.916 --> 49:25.500
This is when you bet it all.

49:25.583 --> 49:27.125
When you got nothing.

49:28.958 --> 49:31.166
All right, fuck this.

49:32.250 --> 49:35.041
Read Orwell
on the lower-upper-middle classes.

49:35.125 --> 49:37.541
They're the ones who really suck.

49:37.625 --> 49:41.250
Once you understand that,
you can operate in America.

49:41.333 --> 49:43.375
If you also have a car.

49:44.958 --> 49:47.041
("Good Times" by Chic playing)

49:47.125 --> 49:48.958
Spent all of last summer in Europe.

49:49.041 --> 49:51.625
Italy. Jesus, Venice.
You ever been to Venice?

49:51.708 --> 49:53.041
No.

49:53.125 --> 49:56.916
Most illogical city
I have ever seen in my life.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.875
The cab is a boat.
The garbage truck is a boat.

49:59.958 --> 50:01.708
Not one bit of it makes any sense.

50:01.791 --> 50:03.291
So how'd you end up in Venice?

50:03.375 --> 50:05.041
Studied hard. I got good grades.

50:05.125 --> 50:06.916
My old man said, "Pick a city."

50:07.000 --> 50:08.750
So, my brother used to make me go with him

50:08.833 --> 50:10.333
and watch Don't Look Now
with Donald Sutherland.

50:10.416 --> 50:11.958
Jesus. How old were you?

50:12.041 --> 50:13.583
That movie made a man out of me.

50:13.666 --> 50:15.041
But it took place in Venice.

50:15.125 --> 50:16.375
First movie was The Exorcist.

50:16.458 --> 50:18.333
My brother had a hard-on
for Julie Christie.

50:18.416 --> 50:20.500
Anyway, long story short, I picked Venice.

50:20.583 --> 50:22.166
Three weeks turns into three months.

50:22.250 --> 50:24.541
And The Exorcist scared the fuck
out of me, by the way.

50:24.625 --> 50:27.250
-The moral of the story is...
-Right, right. The moral of the story is

50:27.333 --> 50:29.708
do well in school,
and you get to see Italy.

50:29.791 --> 50:31.875
Sidney.

50:31.958 --> 50:33.416
Hi.

50:33.500 --> 50:36.666
-Hi.
-How are you? Uh, is Stinky in there?

50:36.750 --> 50:38.708
I don't know where Alex is.

50:38.791 --> 50:40.458
I don't see much of him.

Hey. JR.

-Sidney.
-Hey.

50:43.875 --> 50:45.416
You're in my class.

50:45.500 --> 50:47.125
I doubt it.

50:47.208 --> 50:48.458
(both laughing)

50:48.541 --> 50:51.416
So, uh, how's your Iliad?

50:51.500 --> 50:54.250
-Oh. (laughs)
-(JR chuckles)

50:54.333 --> 50:56.125
-My Iliad's fine.
-Yeah?

50:56.208 --> 50:57.791
Yeah. How's yours?

50:57.875 --> 51:00.833
My Iliad is just getting better and better
as the evening progresses.

51:00.916 --> 51:02.125
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

51:02.208 --> 51:03.333
(laughs)

51:06.791 --> 51:08.208
How-how was the party?

51:08.291 --> 51:10.000
Um, not great.

51:10.083 --> 51:11.208
-No?
-No.

51:11.291 --> 51:12.375
Where you headed?

51:13.458 --> 51:15.125
Walking home.

51:15.208 --> 51:17.208
I'll walk you.

51:19.041 --> 51:20.541
Okay.

51:38.333 --> 51:40.291
So, what does JR stand for?

51:41.458 --> 51:43.375
It's a complicated thing.

51:43.458 --> 51:46.041
I'll tell you when I know you better.

51:46.125 --> 51:47.750
Is there trauma?

51:49.250 --> 51:50.708
Yes.

51:52.166 --> 51:53.875
Father-based?

51:56.000 --> 51:58.291
I'm named after my father.

51:58.375 --> 52:00.583
But I've only seen him a couple of times.

52:00.666 --> 52:03.958
He was always on the radio, in New York.

52:04.041 --> 52:09.375
He was Johnny Ace
or Johnny Michaels on the radio.

52:11.625 --> 52:13.541
Are you in search for your father?

52:15.458 --> 52:18.125
(chuckling):
No, I'm not.

52:18.208 --> 52:20.916
If you have a father complex,
it's kind of a red flag.

52:22.458 --> 52:25.500
Women with father complexes
tend to eat a lot,

52:25.583 --> 52:29.500
but men get really fucked-up.

52:29.583 --> 52:31.416
I don't have a father complex.

52:31.500 --> 52:33.125
He's just a guy on the radio.

52:33.208 --> 52:34.833
That's a relief.

52:34.916 --> 52:36.333
(Sidney laughing)

52:38.666 --> 52:40.583
So, what do you want to be, JR?

52:41.791 --> 52:43.916
Other than an emotional mess.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.166
-Oh. Other than that?
-Mm-hmm.

52:47.625 --> 52:50.083
I want to be a writer.

52:50.166 --> 52:51.833
I'm going to be a writer.

52:53.041 --> 52:55.041
Why a writer?

52:55.125 --> 52:57.083
Ever since I was a kid, I've just...

52:57.166 --> 52:59.375
I love to read everything
I could get my hands on.

52:59.458 --> 53:01.541
Every great writer, every great book.

53:01.625 --> 53:03.416
I got into Yale to be a lawyer.

53:05.666 --> 53:07.666
You don't look like a lawyer.

53:07.750 --> 53:09.333
(JR chuckles)

53:09.416 --> 53:11.041
I'll take that as a compliment.

53:11.125 --> 53:13.208
You do that.

53:13.291 --> 53:15.083
(both chuckle)

53:18.291 --> 53:20.000
This is me.

53:24.291 --> 53:27.000
You want to study together tomorrow?

53:28.250 --> 53:29.875
Okay.

53:30.958 --> 53:32.375
Okay.

53:34.916 --> 53:36.916
Good night, JR.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.583
Good night.

53:42.333 --> 53:44.083
(footsteps ascending stairs)

53:44.166 --> 53:45.833
(keys jingle, lock clicks)

54:08.833 --> 54:10.833
So you think you're in love?

54:12.458 --> 54:15.166
Yeah. I think I'm in love.

54:15.250 --> 54:16.791
She's a lucky girl.

54:16.875 --> 54:18.708
(scoffs) I don't know about that.

54:20.083 --> 54:23.291
-You being careful?
-Jesus, Mom. Fuck.

54:23.375 --> 54:25.500
She's clever. She's perceptive.

54:25.583 --> 54:27.166
Perceptive about what?

54:27.250 --> 54:28.666
Never mind.

54:28.750 --> 54:30.208
What, she's rich?

54:30.291 --> 54:32.958
Probably lower-upper-middle class.

54:33.041 --> 54:35.000
-That's my boy.
-I don't know what that means.

54:35.083 --> 54:36.875
"Lower-middle-upper."

54:36.958 --> 54:39.000
It means the people
who think they're rich.

54:39.083 --> 54:40.500
The actual rich, you never see.

54:40.583 --> 54:42.458
They hide so people won't kill them.

54:42.541 --> 54:45.208
I mean, I just feel like
Sidney's so up here

54:45.291 --> 54:47.083
and I'm so down here.

54:47.166 --> 54:48.916
No, you have so much to offer her.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.583
No money, no idea what it is I want to do.

54:51.666 --> 54:53.750
Besides being a lawyer
and suing my father.

54:53.833 --> 54:56.333
What? That's not why
I want you to be a lawyer.

54:56.416 --> 54:58.791
That would be pathological, JR.

54:58.875 --> 55:02.375
It's not the worst thing if the man
puts the woman on a slight pedestal.

55:02.458 --> 55:03.625
Very slight.

55:03.708 --> 55:05.875
Falling in love is a blessing.
Try to enjoy it.

55:05.958 --> 55:08.875
If you get your heart broken, you'll live.

55:11.041 --> 55:12.750
Ma, I have to ask you something.

55:12.833 --> 55:14.375
What?

55:18.541 --> 55:21.291
I need to go to Sidney's for Christmas.

55:46.833 --> 55:48.833
(vehicle approaching)

56:14.541 --> 56:16.541
(music playing faintly over radio)

56:23.666 --> 56:26.791
-What?
-What?

56:26.875 --> 56:30.458
It's Christmas in Connecticut,
with a Volvo.

56:32.625 --> 56:34.666
I'm never gonna train you out of it, am I?

56:34.750 --> 56:36.916
Train me out of what?

56:37.000 --> 56:39.875
Thinking things are more
than what they are.

56:42.916 --> 56:45.666
-You ever been to Westport?
-No.

56:48.625 --> 56:50.458
You ever fucked in a Volvo?

56:54.583 --> 56:58.083
There wasn't a thing
Sidney wouldn't do or try.

56:59.375 --> 57:01.583
She taught me about love,

57:01.666 --> 57:04.833
and that semester just flew by
for both of us.

57:04.916 --> 57:06.416
I wasn't naive.

57:06.500 --> 57:10.375
I knew that my first great love
probably wouldn't be my last.

57:10.458 --> 57:14.083
But there was something about her,
something different,

57:14.166 --> 57:16.291
something that gave me hope.

57:16.375 --> 57:18.791
("Rock Your Baby"
by George McCrae playing)

57:20.583 --> 57:22.166
(panting, grunting)

57:29.541 --> 57:31.791
(Sidney moaning loudly in other room)

57:38.458 --> 57:40.208
(moaning continues)

57:42.041 --> 57:43.583
(taking deep breaths)

57:47.208 --> 57:49.208
You okay?

57:49.291 --> 57:51.166
-Need a doctor?
-No.

57:51.250 --> 57:52.958
-I just need a minute.
-Okay.

58:02.208 --> 58:04.208
(song fades)

58:07.416 --> 58:09.375
(sighs)

58:11.958 --> 58:13.375
Morning, sport.

58:13.458 --> 58:15.250
(JR sighs) Morning.

58:16.916 --> 58:18.875
So, my parents...

58:20.000 --> 58:21.416
They already heard you.

58:21.500 --> 58:23.708
-Uh-oh.
-(laughs)

58:23.791 --> 58:25.333
They want to meet you.

58:34.875 --> 58:36.875
I think I should take you to the train.

58:37.958 --> 58:39.250
Why?

58:39.333 --> 58:42.208
It's very complicated.

58:42.291 --> 58:44.208
I'm feeling weird.

58:45.291 --> 58:47.500
I'm sorry I brought you for Christmas.

58:52.791 --> 58:54.708
I think I'm seeing someone else.

59:02.958 --> 59:04.583
I'll see you downstairs.

59:26.125 --> 59:28.375
SIDNEY'
Do you like scones, JR?

59:28.458 --> 59:30.333
Oh, I love scones, sir.

59:30.416 --> 59:33.083
-Call me Phil.
-Thanks, Phil.

59:33.166 --> 59:37.083
Since you can call him Phil,
I suppose you can call me Mrs. Lawson.

59:38.083 --> 59:39.708
(laughs)

59:50.416 --> 59:51.500
Mmm.

59:58.416 --> 1:00:01.625
(mouth full):
Well, Sidney tells me... Excuse me.

1:00:01.708 --> 1:00:03.708
(chuckles) So, Sidney...

1:00:03.791 --> 1:00:06.875
Sidney tells me you're both architects.

1:00:06.958 --> 1:00:09.791
Some people build houses.
We build dwellings.

1:00:09.875 --> 1:00:12.583
What's the difference except the word?

1:00:12.666 --> 1:00:15.958
I mean, I just failed an English exam,
but a house is a dwelling

1:00:16.041 --> 1:00:18.583
unless it's a cave,
and a dwelling is a house...

1:00:18.666 --> 1:00:21.291
They also run the magazine Dwellings.

1:00:21.375 --> 1:00:23.083
What?

1:00:23.166 --> 1:00:24.916
The magazine called Dwellings.

1:00:29.125 --> 1:00:30.458
Oh.

1:00:30.541 --> 1:00:32.416
I don't think you should dwell on it.

1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:34.708
-(light laughter)
-No.

1:00:36.166 --> 1:00:38.291
MRS.
I understand you have an absconded father

1:00:38.375 --> 1:00:41.583
who's nothing more to you
than a voice on the radio.

1:00:43.958 --> 1:00:45.958
Yeah, pretty much. (chuckles softly)

1:00:46.041 --> 1:00:48.666
Are you in psychotherapy?
I should think you would be.

1:00:48.750 --> 1:00:50.583
No psychotherapy, no.

1:00:50.666 --> 1:00:52.291
Surprisingly. (chuckles)

1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:58.750
What does your mother do, JR?

1:01:05.250 --> 1:01:08.625
She dwells in Manhasset,

1:01:08.708 --> 1:01:11.875
in a house with her parents,
who are both kind of nuts.

1:01:11.958 --> 1:01:13.916
And she's a secretary.

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.791
And one of the things she always
loved to do was ride around

1:01:19.875 --> 1:01:21.916
looking at houses like this one

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.208
and wonder what life must be like in them.

1:01:25.291 --> 1:01:27.291
Now I can tell her.

1:01:27.375 --> 1:01:29.458
Please do.

1:01:30.583 --> 1:01:32.583
I will.

1:01:33.666 --> 1:01:35.000
What do you study?

1:01:38.291 --> 1:01:41.041
You know, Phil, I study people.

1:01:41.125 --> 1:01:43.291
I think I've always studied people.

1:01:43.375 --> 1:01:45.875
And this is great.

1:01:45.958 --> 1:01:47.791
JR is a writer.

1:01:47.875 --> 1:01:49.833
I mean, what do you study at Yale?

1:01:50.916 --> 1:01:53.333
Usual fucking bullshit.
My mother wants me to be a lawyer.

1:01:53.416 --> 1:01:57.125
She sounds like a very intelligent woman,
if a trifle optimistic.

1:01:57.208 --> 1:01:58.916
(JR chuckles)

1:02:07.041 --> 1:02:08.958
Phil, you ever fucked in a Volvo?

1:02:10.208 --> 1:02:13.208
("50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"
by Paul Simon playing)

1:02:14.250 --> 1:02:17.000
And that was it-- dumped in Connecticut.

1:02:19.250 --> 1:02:24.125
I'd spend the next two years just focusing
on making something of myself.

1:02:24.208 --> 1:02:26.416
Being somebody.

1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:28.791
Somebody Sidney would want back.

1:02:32.041 --> 1:02:33.125
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:02:33.208 --> 1:02:34.375
Charlie!

1:03:47.875 --> 1:03:49.750
This seat taken?

1:03:49.833 --> 1:03:51.708
Look who it is. Sit down there.

1:03:52.791 --> 1:03:54.833
My senior year was gonna be epic.

1:03:54.916 --> 1:03:58.041
Writing for the paper, working at the bar.

1:03:58.125 --> 1:03:59.875
This was gonna be my year.

1:03:59.958 --> 1:04:01.791
I didn't need Sidney.

1:04:01.875 --> 1:04:03.708
In fact, fuck Sidney.

1:04:04.750 --> 1:04:06.500
Are you any good at writing?

1:04:06.583 --> 1:04:09.916
I fear that sometimes
the question is too little asked.

1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:12.625
I don't know.

1:04:12.708 --> 1:04:14.333
I have stuff in the Yale paper.

1:04:14.416 --> 1:04:16.125
A lot of people don't.

1:04:16.208 --> 1:04:17.583
Lot of people do. (chuckles)

1:04:20.041 --> 1:04:22.125
I always love to see you on this train.

1:04:23.208 --> 1:04:24.750
What's your main trouble?

1:04:24.833 --> 1:04:26.791
I'm just a poor boy who wants a rich girl.

1:04:26.875 --> 1:04:28.458
(chuckles softly)

1:04:28.541 --> 1:04:29.708
That's been done.

1:04:29.791 --> 1:04:31.208
She's not really rich.

1:04:31.291 --> 1:04:33.625
She's lower-upper-middle.

1:04:33.708 --> 1:04:36.708
Well, you never see the real rich.
They're invisible.

1:04:38.041 --> 1:04:40.791
Do you have plans in your head
to make something of yourself,

1:04:40.875 --> 1:04:42.708
go and sweep her away?

1:04:45.708 --> 1:04:47.125
Maybe.

1:04:47.208 --> 1:04:49.625
If she loved you, she'd take you poor.

1:04:51.208 --> 1:04:52.625
Heard it here first.

1:04:52.708 --> 1:04:54.000
(chuckles)

1:04:54.083 --> 1:04:56.041
I've heard it from someone else.

1:04:56.125 --> 1:04:59.208
Also, the Gatsby thing, you know?

1:05:00.333 --> 1:05:03.458
Well, what's your main theme?
Since it isn't really that one.

1:05:03.541 --> 1:05:07.000
The absent father. You know that one?

1:05:08.083 --> 1:05:11.125
Sure, how else do you think
people become priests?

1:05:11.208 --> 1:05:12.958
(chuckles)

1:05:17.333 --> 1:05:19.333
(knocking)

1:05:33.583 --> 1:05:35.583
(sighs)

1:05:41.375 --> 1:05:43.208
You know, you really had me going.

1:05:43.291 --> 1:05:45.208
About what?

1:05:45.291 --> 1:05:50.000
Well, for the past year--
year and a half, frankly--

1:05:50.083 --> 1:05:52.416
it's... my life's been hell.

1:05:53.625 --> 1:05:55.500
About me?

1:05:55.583 --> 1:05:57.291
-Yes, about you.
-(chuckles)

1:05:58.291 --> 1:06:00.166
What do you want from me?

1:06:01.333 --> 1:06:03.958
Well, we're seniors.

1:06:06.291 --> 1:06:07.958
I'm getting agita.

1:06:08.041 --> 1:06:12.041
Is agita the root of agitation?

1:06:12.125 --> 1:06:14.458
No. Men who want things are.

1:06:14.541 --> 1:06:18.083
You know, I think you think
I want something that I'm not thinking.

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:24.166
Unless you want me to think it.

1:06:25.583 --> 1:06:27.416
I'm seeing someone.

1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:31.541
You got to be fucking kidding me.

1:06:32.625 --> 1:06:35.958
I can't explain it, really,
why I kept going back.

1:06:36.041 --> 1:06:38.500
She just had my number.

1:06:38.583 --> 1:06:42.000
All right,
so she gets agita, whatever that is.

1:06:42.083 --> 1:06:44.125
It's Yiddish for "nerves."

1:06:44.208 --> 1:06:47.750
All right, so she gets that
and she needs her space

1:06:47.833 --> 1:06:50.750
and her time and all that, right?

1:06:50.833 --> 1:06:52.958
So I have a question for you.

1:06:54.250 --> 1:06:56.250
What do you need?

1:06:58.708 --> 1:07:01.458
Look, I'm not a genius.
It's an obvious question.

1:07:01.541 --> 1:07:04.791
What do I want?
I want to be a writer, but I suck.

1:07:04.875 --> 1:07:07.583
Well, when you suck at writing,
that's when you become a journalist.

1:07:07.666 --> 1:07:09.333
I'm not going to law school.

1:07:09.416 --> 1:07:11.250
Neither am I.

1:07:14.125 --> 1:07:17.250
-My mom, she...
-Your mom wants you happy.

1:07:17.333 --> 1:07:19.625
Yeah, she does.

1:07:19.708 --> 1:07:21.833
Neither of us know how.

1:07:29.208 --> 1:07:31.750
Let's go back and get graduated.

1:07:32.833 --> 1:07:34.416
(chuckles)

1:07:36.375 --> 1:07:38.000
All right.

1:07:43.583 --> 1:07:45.791
-I'm here. I understand it's a big deal.
-Do you?

1:07:45.875 --> 1:07:47.791
-Yeah.
-He graduated from Yale.

1:07:47.875 --> 1:07:49.666
Your father graduated from Dartmouth.

1:07:50.750 --> 1:07:53.541
So, without further ado,
let's bring them in.

1:07:53.625 --> 1:07:55.708
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give a warm welcome

1:07:55.791 --> 1:07:58.541
to the Yale class of 1986.

1:07:58.625 --> 1:08:01.541
(Valentin Haussmann's
"Polnischer Tanz, Deutscher Tanz" playing)

1:08:07.208 --> 1:08:09.208
(applause)

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.416
-(knocking)
-There's a call for you.

1:08:31.541 --> 1:08:33.375
Hello?

1:08:33.458 --> 1:08:35.083
Remember me?

1:08:36.458 --> 1:08:37.875
Hey, Dad.

1:08:37.958 --> 1:08:39.958
I-I-I didn't make it, as you know.

1:08:40.041 --> 1:08:42.208
Uh, no... no surprise there.

1:08:42.291 --> 1:08:46.333
Uh, but I did want to tell you that, uh...

1:08:46.416 --> 1:08:48.166
I quit drinking.

1:08:48.250 --> 1:08:51.166
And, uh, I've been here and there...

1:08:52.666 --> 1:08:54.666
(laughs) â€¦apologizing

1:08:54.750 --> 1:08:58.375
and... you made the list.

1:08:58.458 --> 1:09:01.291
-Wow.
-Oh, come on. Don't fuck with me.

1:09:02.958 --> 1:09:04.583
Hey, I'm glad you made it.

1:09:04.666 --> 1:09:06.625
Uh, I was worried.

1:09:06.708 --> 1:09:09.000
College ain't for everybody.

1:09:09.083 --> 1:09:12.375
It was for Mom, but you got her pregnant.

1:09:12.458 --> 1:09:16.250
Yes, well, we all have to paddle
our own canoe, JR.

1:09:16.333 --> 1:09:19.416
Seems like your mother's got you
paddling hers a little bit.

1:09:20.500 --> 1:09:24.375
I think she's been paddling both of ours
for a very long time.

1:09:27.541 --> 1:09:28.958
Maybe.

1:09:30.458 --> 1:09:33.250
Uh, all right, well, I'm on the air
in 15 and change.

1:09:33.333 --> 1:09:34.750
I got to go.

1:09:34.833 --> 1:09:37.041
-Where are you?
-(click, dial tone)

1:09:42.750 --> 1:09:44.583
What law schools are you looking at?

1:09:45.666 --> 1:09:46.958
None.

1:09:47.041 --> 1:09:48.791
I'm gonna be a novelist.

1:09:52.791 --> 1:09:54.375
Where you gonna live?

1:09:54.458 --> 1:09:57.750
At Grandpa's, like everybody.

1:09:57.833 --> 1:09:59.250
We all go to Grandpa's.

1:09:59.333 --> 1:10:03.000
I mean, I-I know you think this is
supposed to change everything, but...

1:10:03.083 --> 1:10:04.416
You have to have a job.

1:10:04.500 --> 1:10:07.166
I will have a job-- writing a novel.

1:10:09.333 --> 1:10:11.583
Publishing is going more towards memoir.

1:10:11.666 --> 1:10:13.375
(chuckles) That's true.

1:10:19.708 --> 1:10:21.708
Here.

1:10:21.791 --> 1:10:23.416
Is this for Sidney?

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:25.250
No.

1:10:25.333 --> 1:10:26.875
Open it.

1:10:34.125 --> 1:10:35.333
It's a Yale ring.

1:10:35.416 --> 1:10:37.916
I don't like male jewelry, but I thought,

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.750
since the Musketeers
actually did this together...

1:10:41.833 --> 1:10:43.541
It's for you.

1:10:49.583 --> 1:10:51.583
(JR chuckles)

1:10:59.875 --> 1:11:01.708
Jesus, fuck.

1:11:01.791 --> 1:11:04.541
Symbolically,
you just married your mother.

1:11:04.625 --> 1:11:06.541
-Whoa. Take it easy.
-All right, all right, all right.

1:11:06.625 --> 1:11:09.375
So let's say... let's say you closed
the circle with one parent, right?

1:11:09.458 --> 1:11:11.291
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Maybe.

1:11:11.375 --> 1:11:13.125
What about The Voice?

1:11:13.208 --> 1:11:15.458
-I don't even know where he is.
-The Voice...

1:11:15.541 --> 1:11:18.666
locked in a downward spiral
since the Carter administration.

1:11:19.833 --> 1:11:23.083
So both you assholes just graduated?

1:11:23.166 --> 1:11:25.833
Charlie, back 'em up on me.

1:11:25.916 --> 1:11:27.458
-Aw.
-Thanks, Chief.

1:11:27.541 --> 1:11:30.500
So, how much do they get
for a Yale education these days?

1:11:30.583 --> 1:11:32.000
Oh, it's 60 grand.

1:11:32.083 --> 1:11:34.958
-60?
-JR got grants and scholarships.

1:11:35.041 --> 1:11:37.250
Wesley, you were a full-ticket guy?

1:11:37.333 --> 1:11:38.541
All right, answer me this.

1:11:38.625 --> 1:11:42.041
What year... was the Magna Carta signed?

1:11:43.125 --> 1:11:45.041
-I don't know.
-I don't fucking know.

1:11:45.125 --> 1:11:47.958
-Survey says...
-1215.

1:11:48.041 --> 1:11:50.541
It's the foundation of English law.
You should know it.

1:11:50.625 --> 1:11:52.708
-Bulwark against tyranny.
-King John.

1:11:52.791 --> 1:11:54.625
-- That's right.
-- At this point, Chief,

1:11:54.708 --> 1:11:57.125
-I don't give a shit.
-He doesn't give a shit.

1:11:57.208 --> 1:12:00.000
Kid, I'm just trying to keep you
out of the ruling classes. That's all.

1:12:00.083 --> 1:12:01.750
Too late, Chief. Too late.

1:12:01.833 --> 1:12:04.833
$60,000. My house cost $12,000.

1:12:04.916 --> 1:12:07.875
-Your house cost $7,000.
-My house cost $7,000.

1:12:10.791 --> 1:12:12.958
I was kind of into
the "clean break" idea.

1:12:13.041 --> 1:12:14.666
SIDNEY (laughs):
We can be friends.

1:12:14.750 --> 1:12:16.708
Just not romantic or sexual.

1:12:16.791 --> 1:12:18.833
That sounds appealing.

1:12:18.916 --> 1:12:20.333
(Sidney laughs)

1:12:20.416 --> 1:12:22.791
So, what are you doing?

1:12:22.875 --> 1:12:24.291
I'm at the bar a lot.

1:12:24.375 --> 1:12:26.458
I'm working on my novel.

1:12:28.125 --> 1:12:30.166
Publishing is heading towards memoir.

1:12:30.250 --> 1:12:32.833
People have been saying that. Yeah.

1:12:32.916 --> 1:12:34.875
So, how many pages do you have?

1:12:36.708 --> 1:12:38.041
Many.

1:12:39.166 --> 1:12:40.875
Have you applied to newspapers?

1:12:40.958 --> 1:12:43.125
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You have clips?

1:12:43.208 --> 1:12:44.958
You contacted The New York Times?

1:12:45.041 --> 1:12:47.500
Would you like it if I was at The Times?

1:12:48.750 --> 1:12:50.875
I love you anyway.

1:12:50.958 --> 1:12:52.750
I just don't want a relationship.

1:12:52.833 --> 1:12:54.250
But you have a relationship.

1:12:54.333 --> 1:12:57.250
It's just not romantic or sexual.

1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:05.708
I think The Times is probably
out of my league.

1:13:07.375 --> 1:13:09.208
Was Yale out of your league?

1:13:10.291 --> 1:13:12.625
-Can we just go to your place?
-No.

1:13:14.166 --> 1:13:15.708
I live with him.

1:13:20.333 --> 1:13:23.625
So, Sidney saw you
in your reduced condition.

1:13:24.708 --> 1:13:26.833
-But she was checking up on you.
-Yeah.

1:13:26.916 --> 1:13:29.000
She was trying to see if you had
your shit together.

1:13:29.083 --> 1:13:31.458
(laughing):
Uh...

1:13:31.541 --> 1:13:35.291
I don't even have any shit
to get together.

1:13:35.375 --> 1:13:38.166
-I don't. I don't have anything.
-Hey. Hey, hey, listen.

1:13:38.250 --> 1:13:41.666
What did I tell you
about the male sciences?

1:13:41.750 --> 1:13:43.375
-Remember that?
-Yeah.

1:13:43.458 --> 1:13:45.375
-Right? Have a job.
-Right.

1:13:45.458 --> 1:13:46.625
-Have a car.
-Yeah.

1:13:46.708 --> 1:13:48.750
-Put all your shit in it.
-I don't have any of that.

1:13:48.833 --> 1:13:52.583
So you can be independent,
and then somebody might want you.

1:13:52.666 --> 1:13:55.208
And if they don't,
you get the fuck out of there.

1:13:57.166 --> 1:13:58.541
Right?

1:13:58.625 --> 1:14:00.291
(JR breathing deeply)

1:14:01.375 --> 1:14:04.208
-(phone rings)
-New York Times.

1:14:04.291 --> 1:14:06.375
Yes. Can I tell him who's calling?

1:14:08.125 --> 1:14:09.458
Take care.

1:14:09.541 --> 1:14:11.541
(indistinct chatter)

1:14:12.916 --> 1:14:14.875
-(phone rings)
-New York Times.

1:14:15.916 --> 1:14:17.083
-Hi. Are you JR?
-Yes.

1:14:17.166 --> 1:14:18.625
Yeah, you can come with me.

1:14:19.708 --> 1:14:22.041
We all like your clips from New Haven.

1:14:22.125 --> 1:14:23.875
Where are you working now?

1:14:23.958 --> 1:14:25.875
I'm writing fiction, I think.

1:14:25.958 --> 1:14:29.583
And I work at a family business.

1:14:30.583 --> 1:14:33.291
It's a hospitality business.

1:14:33.375 --> 1:14:35.958
A bar on Long Island.

1:14:36.041 --> 1:14:37.666
(chuckles)

1:14:37.750 --> 1:14:41.125
-Your clips are good, Mr. Maguire.
-They are?

1:14:41.208 --> 1:14:43.875
The editors feel they need to see more
before they make a decision.

1:14:43.958 --> 1:14:45.500
You want to see more?

1:14:45.583 --> 1:14:46.916
Yes.

1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:50.125
Is that good?

1:14:50.208 --> 1:14:52.000
Yes.

1:14:52.083 --> 1:14:53.708
(sighs)

1:14:54.916 --> 1:14:57.125
I don't have more.

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.708
Let me tell Brian that.

1:15:06.041 --> 1:15:07.875
Do you want to meet Brian?

1:15:09.333 --> 1:15:12.208
(chuckles softly)
Not if I don't have a job.

1:15:15.250 --> 1:15:17.125
Why don't you come and meet him?

1:15:18.125 --> 1:15:20.208
-(phones ringing)
-(heavy, indistinct chatter)

1:15:20.291 --> 1:15:22.291
(typewriter keys clacking)

1:15:43.416 --> 1:15:45.416
JR, come in.

1:15:47.791 --> 1:15:49.250
Hi, sir.

1:15:52.125 --> 1:15:53.958
So do not write to her

1:15:54.041 --> 1:15:56.333
and tell her that you've
improved your position,

1:15:56.416 --> 1:15:58.625
because that will take away
all the power and the majesty

1:15:58.708 --> 1:16:00.208
of her finding this out for herself.

1:16:00.291 --> 1:16:02.083
I already did.

1:16:02.166 --> 1:16:05.541
Can you fucking come to me
with this shit, please?

1:16:05.625 --> 1:16:08.625
Do not tell her you want her back.
Did you say that?

1:16:08.708 --> 1:16:10.625
Uh, yeah. (chuckles)

1:16:10.708 --> 1:16:12.541
Did you go and...

1:16:12.625 --> 1:16:14.958
stare up at the building,
like, in the rain and shit?

1:16:15.041 --> 1:16:16.375
No.

1:16:17.458 --> 1:16:18.458
Sidney!

1:16:18.541 --> 1:16:22.708
JR, this girl has abandoned you
how many times?

1:16:23.791 --> 1:16:26.541
If someone abandons you,
what does that tell you?

1:16:27.583 --> 1:16:29.500
You, of all people.

1:16:29.583 --> 1:16:31.791
She just needs time, you know?

1:16:31.875 --> 1:16:34.958
Yeah, I think you're missing
a central fact,

1:16:35.041 --> 1:16:38.625
which is that women decide
if they want something or if they don't,

1:16:38.708 --> 1:16:40.833
and it becomes very obvious very fast.

1:16:40.916 --> 1:16:43.500
-But...
-Women decide.

1:16:43.583 --> 1:16:46.208
-I know, but...
-When you met, who decided?

1:16:46.291 --> 1:16:49.083
-She did.
-There you go, numb nuts.

1:16:49.166 --> 1:16:51.375
Standard pattern, obvious to all.

1:16:51.458 --> 1:16:53.666
You do see a pattern, right?

1:16:57.416 --> 1:16:58.833
Hey! (clears throat)

1:16:58.916 --> 1:17:00.875
JR got a job at The Times.

1:17:00.958 --> 1:17:02.958
(others cheering)

1:17:05.333 --> 1:17:07.250
I'm a... I'm a copyboy.

1:17:07.333 --> 1:17:09.625
-(laughing): You're a copyboy?
-I-I get sandwiches. I...

1:17:09.708 --> 1:17:12.041
Hey, Charlie, back him up on me.

1:17:14.541 --> 1:17:18.375
So, your first byline
presents a, uh, problem.

1:17:18.458 --> 1:17:22.958
Uh, i-initials cannot be used
without periods.

1:17:23.041 --> 1:17:24.791
I've done some research,

1:17:24.875 --> 1:17:27.541
and Harry S Truman
did not use a dot after his...

1:17:27.625 --> 1:17:29.000
They're not called dots.

1:17:30.875 --> 1:17:33.500
EE Cummings-- uh, no, uh, periods.

1:17:33.583 --> 1:17:35.416
And The Times uses them anyway.

1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:36.875
And do you know why?

1:17:36.958 --> 1:17:38.791
'Cause it looks like we forgot.

1:17:38.875 --> 1:17:43.041
Times style is Times style,
and you are J-period R-period Maguire.

1:17:43.125 --> 1:17:45.041
Period.

1:17:45.125 --> 1:17:47.541
There's no periods after a last name.

1:17:47.625 --> 1:17:49.958
My congratulations on your fine work.

1:17:50.041 --> 1:17:52.250
You got a byline in The New York Times.

1:17:58.541 --> 1:17:59.541
Anything else?

1:18:01.208 --> 1:18:03.208
Oh. No, thank you.

1:18:04.291 --> 1:18:06.791
-(phones ringing)
-(heavy, indistinct chatter)

1:18:06.875 --> 1:18:08.875
(typewriter keys clacking)

1:18:16.583 --> 1:18:18.041
(chuckles)

1:18:18.125 --> 1:18:19.541
Dad owns the firm.

1:18:19.625 --> 1:18:21.416
Brothers are partners.

1:18:21.500 --> 1:18:22.750
Sooner or later, it's gonna...

1:18:22.833 --> 1:18:24.750
-Lucky Sperm Club.
-Lucky Sperm Club.

1:18:24.833 --> 1:18:26.250
-Exactly. Yes.
-Here you go.

1:18:26.333 --> 1:18:27.833
Thank you.

1:18:27.916 --> 1:18:29.458
So you got promoted?

1:18:29.541 --> 1:18:32.375
Oh, no, I'm promoted
when I become a full-fledged reporter

1:18:32.458 --> 1:18:34.125
and when my byline appears every day.

1:18:34.208 --> 1:18:37.375
And you still won't have the background
Sidney's looking for

1:18:37.458 --> 1:18:40.250
and you'll be mainly blossoming
as a barfly.

1:18:40.333 --> 1:18:42.291
-Uh-huh, well...
-Ah, you know, genetics is tough.

1:18:42.375 --> 1:18:44.000
What are you gonna do?

1:18:44.083 --> 1:18:46.250
Incidentally, where is the old man?

1:18:46.333 --> 1:18:48.250
-Uh, somewhere south.
-Mm.

1:18:48.333 --> 1:18:50.166
You know, you're becoming
like your mother about Yale.

1:18:50.250 --> 1:18:51.333
Oh, yeah?

1:18:51.416 --> 1:18:53.500
Yeah, you think The Times means something.

1:18:53.583 --> 1:18:55.208
Yeah, because it does.
It's The New York fucking Times.

1:18:55.291 --> 1:18:57.625
-No, no, it doesn't.
-Well, what does mean something?

1:18:57.708 --> 1:18:59.875
A book. With a book, you'll go years

1:18:59.958 --> 1:19:02.166
before you realize that
that doesn't mean anything, either.

1:19:02.250 --> 1:19:05.750
And I'm telling you, JR, I promise you,
whether you write at The Times,

1:19:05.833 --> 1:19:08.000
whether you write this book,

1:19:08.083 --> 1:19:11.250
Sidney will still never call you
out of the blue to get you back.

1:19:11.333 --> 1:19:12.750
-Okay, and do you know why?
-Why?

1:19:12.833 --> 1:19:15.041
Why won't Sidney ever call me,
genius who knows everything?

1:19:15.125 --> 1:19:18.000
Because she's dumped you like nine times.

1:19:18.083 --> 1:19:21.041
-(scoffs)
-Because she doesn't love you, man.

1:19:23.916 --> 1:19:27.083
Because she's getting married
on Memorial Day.

1:19:27.166 --> 1:19:29.375
("Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues"
by Danny O'Keefe playing)

1:19:29.458 --> 1:19:33.083
In retrospect, what you do next
is gonna be important.

1:19:34.083 --> 1:19:36.208
You gentlemen ready to order?

1:19:36.291 --> 1:19:38.458
Four gin martinis, up with a twist.

1:20:02.125 --> 1:20:04.833
-Hey.

1:20:04.916 --> 1:20:06.666
-Wake the fuck up.
-(song stops)

1:20:07.666 --> 1:20:09.916
I thought you were gonna be a writer.

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:12.500
I am.

1:20:12.583 --> 1:20:15.750
No, you're not. You're a copyboy.

1:20:15.833 --> 1:20:17.750
-I write.
-A book?

1:20:17.833 --> 1:20:19.916
-No.
-So you're just a fuckup.

1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:21.625
-I'm not a fuckup.
-Yeah, you are.

1:20:21.708 --> 1:20:23.958
And you come from a long line of fuckups.

1:20:25.041 --> 1:20:26.541
That's true.

1:20:26.625 --> 1:20:28.500
You want to know what I think?

1:20:29.583 --> 1:20:31.000
Probably not.

1:20:31.083 --> 1:20:35.375
I think you should go back to sleep,
wake up in 20 years,

1:20:35.458 --> 1:20:37.833
tell everybody how good you could've been.

1:20:40.125 --> 1:20:41.750
That's what I think.

1:20:43.083 --> 1:20:44.625
-Fuck you.
-Fuck you...

1:20:44.708 --> 1:20:46.375
(inhales sharply)

1:20:46.458 --> 1:20:48.458
(birds chirping)

1:20:51.500 --> 1:20:53.166
(groans softly)

1:20:55.583 --> 1:20:58.083
-(heavy, indistinct chatter)
-(typewriter keys clacking)

1:20:58.166 --> 1:21:00.166
(phones ringing)

1:21:09.708 --> 1:21:11.375
Stinky.

1:21:12.416 --> 1:21:15.250
Hey. He's looking for you.

1:21:16.708 --> 1:21:18.625
(sighs) This is it.

1:21:18.708 --> 1:21:20.083
Lucky bastard.

1:21:23.500 --> 1:21:25.583
As you know,
the editors have had a chance

1:21:25.666 --> 1:21:29.291
to carefully review your work,
and, um, it's terrific.

1:21:29.375 --> 1:21:32.875
Truly, some of your pieces
have been outstanding.

1:21:32.958 --> 1:21:36.708
Though most of them are about, uh,
people in bars on Long Island, uh...

1:21:36.791 --> 1:21:38.125
(both chuckle)

1:21:38.208 --> 1:21:41.291
Uh, some of your pieces have been
truly, truly outstanding.

1:21:41.375 --> 1:21:45.000
Um, that's why I wish I had better news.

1:21:45.083 --> 1:21:47.708
Um, as you know, um,

1:21:47.791 --> 1:21:51.000
when the committee meets
to consider a trainee,

1:21:51.083 --> 1:21:54.041
some editors voice support, some do not.

1:21:54.125 --> 1:21:58.208
A vote's taken-- and, um,
I can't tell you who voted how or why--

1:21:58.291 --> 1:22:00.791
but, um, the end result is

1:22:00.875 --> 1:22:04.000
I cannot offer you
a position as a reporter.

1:22:08.333 --> 1:22:09.750
Thank you.

1:22:09.833 --> 1:22:13.291
The feeling is that you lack,
uh, experience, you know?

1:22:13.375 --> 1:22:16.208
Smaller newspaper, perhaps, you know?

1:22:16.291 --> 1:22:19.958
Someplace where you can, uh,
learn and grow.

1:22:21.791 --> 1:22:23.500
No. Thank you.

1:22:26.625 --> 1:22:28.750
-(phones ringing)
-(heavy, indistinct chatter)

1:22:28.833 --> 1:22:30.833
(typewriter keys clacking)

1:22:47.583 --> 1:22:49.208
It's your mom.

1:22:54.083 --> 1:22:55.375
Hello?

1:22:55.458 --> 1:22:57.000
Don't look at me like that.

1:22:57.083 --> 1:22:58.458
They said it was minor.

1:22:59.750 --> 1:23:01.250
Let me tell you something.

1:23:01.333 --> 1:23:04.125
It may be possible to kill me,

1:23:04.208 --> 1:23:06.250
but it is not easy.

1:23:07.625 --> 1:23:09.958
Okay. You sure you're all right?

1:23:10.041 --> 1:23:12.333
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:23:12.416 --> 1:23:15.125
Good. Be out of here in a few days.

1:23:16.208 --> 1:23:18.083
(sighs)

1:23:18.166 --> 1:23:20.541
What's going on? What's up?

1:23:20.625 --> 1:23:22.208
Ah.

1:23:22.291 --> 1:23:26.000
Well, they didn't offer me that position.

1:23:27.291 --> 1:23:29.375
Pure gold.

1:23:29.458 --> 1:23:31.458
All those assholes are now characters.

1:23:31.541 --> 1:23:32.833
Yeah, I guess so.

1:23:32.916 --> 1:23:35.083
This incident itself is dramatic.

1:23:35.166 --> 1:23:36.458
You can inflate this.

1:23:36.541 --> 1:23:38.041
Yeah. Okay.

1:23:38.125 --> 1:23:39.333
No, I think so.

1:23:39.416 --> 1:23:42.750
Maybe... maybe this is the point where

1:23:42.833 --> 1:23:45.291
you tell me something really important.

1:23:45.375 --> 1:23:47.000
Yeah.

1:23:48.416 --> 1:23:52.791
I... To be honest, I'm not 100% sure
we should go memoir.

1:23:52.875 --> 1:23:55.583
But we have to be conscious
of the trend, right?

1:23:56.791 --> 1:23:59.250
However, if it is a memoir,

1:23:59.333 --> 1:24:01.916
and if it's gonna have any structure...

1:24:03.041 --> 1:24:04.958
...you know what you have to do.

1:24:08.333 --> 1:24:11.083
He's in North Carolina doing a talk show.

1:24:14.583 --> 1:24:17.125
Your father came to Manhasset once...
(clears throat)

1:24:17.208 --> 1:24:20.208
seeking rapprochements with your mother.

1:24:20.291 --> 1:24:23.166
Came on the train-- didn't have a car.

1:24:23.250 --> 1:24:25.125
Can't have any kind
of fucking rapprochements

1:24:25.208 --> 1:24:27.416
with any kind of chick
if you don't have a fucking car.

1:24:27.500 --> 1:24:28.625
You know this.

1:24:28.708 --> 1:24:30.666
You've told me, yes,
and the stashies in your wallet...

1:24:30.750 --> 1:24:32.166
Maybe in the future of transportation

1:24:32.250 --> 1:24:34.125
or in Holland or whatever,
things are different,

1:24:34.208 --> 1:24:37.416
but in America, have a car.

1:24:37.500 --> 1:24:38.583
Right?

1:24:39.916 --> 1:24:44.333
(clears throat) Anyway, your mother
already told him to fuck off.

1:24:44.416 --> 1:24:46.083
He shows up.

1:24:46.166 --> 1:24:47.750
Comes into the bar.

1:24:48.791 --> 1:24:52.000
Orders a well Scotch neat.

1:24:52.083 --> 1:24:53.625
(chuckles softly)

1:24:53.708 --> 1:24:55.708
Never order a well Scotch.

1:24:55.791 --> 1:24:57.458
Never order it neat.

1:24:58.583 --> 1:25:01.750
It's a signal
that you're reaching the end.

1:25:03.750 --> 1:25:06.500
And in his case, this was 20 years ago.

1:25:09.166 --> 1:25:12.500
And then I loaned the guy
30 bucks, which...

1:25:12.583 --> 1:25:14.583
I have yet to see since.

1:25:16.625 --> 1:25:19.500
And over all these years,

1:25:19.583 --> 1:25:24.166
all I really remember about him
is that fucking voice.

1:25:25.250 --> 1:25:27.708
I mean, the set of pipes.

1:25:30.208 --> 1:25:32.875
Uh, as I get older...

1:25:34.041 --> 1:25:36.333
I wonder,

1:25:36.416 --> 1:25:38.541
you know, like...

1:25:38.625 --> 1:25:40.625
what was the fucking problem?

1:25:42.083 --> 1:25:43.916
I mean...

1:25:45.708 --> 1:25:47.166
...if...

1:25:47.250 --> 1:25:48.291
(sighs)

1:25:50.958 --> 1:25:52.791
Do I remind you of him?

1:25:55.833 --> 1:25:57.708
Lighten up on your drinking.

1:26:01.208 --> 1:26:03.208
(sighs)

1:26:05.833 --> 1:26:07.958
He was right, of course.

1:26:08.041 --> 1:26:12.000
First thing he did when he got out
of the hospital was light a cigarette.

1:26:12.083 --> 1:26:15.166
What's that line about old dogs
and new tricks?

1:26:16.250 --> 1:26:17.458
Speaking of old dogs...

1:26:19.875 --> 1:26:21.500
It was time.

1:26:54.958 --> 1:26:57.458
Oh, come here and give your old man a hug.

1:27:02.625 --> 1:27:04.250
Thanks for making the trip.

1:27:05.833 --> 1:27:07.208
Yeah.

1:27:10.375 --> 1:27:15.208
(sighs) So, uh, I don't know
if I told you on the phone, but, um...

1:27:16.416 --> 1:27:20.041
I'm allowing myself a cocktail
from time to time.

1:27:21.833 --> 1:27:23.583
-I thought you were...
-You-you want one?

1:27:23.666 --> 1:27:25.041
-Hey, Johnny.
-Hey.

1:27:25.125 --> 1:27:27.083
-What can I get for you?
-Um...

1:27:27.166 --> 1:27:29.375
Double Scotch, whatever the well is,

1:27:29.458 --> 1:27:32.208
uh, rocks, splash of water, no fruit.

1:27:32.291 --> 1:27:34.333
No fruit. Okay.

1:27:34.416 --> 1:27:36.125
-And for you?
-I'm fine.

1:27:36.208 --> 1:27:37.708
Oh, come on, don't fuck with me.

1:27:37.791 --> 1:27:40.166
-He's gonna have what I'm having.
-You got it.

1:27:42.958 --> 1:27:44.666
I make the rules.

1:27:45.750 --> 1:27:47.250
Unless you can take me.

1:27:51.041 --> 1:27:52.708
You want to take me on?

1:27:55.083 --> 1:27:58.208
For being a shitty father,
I'll give you the first shot.

1:27:58.291 --> 1:27:59.916
(chuckles softly)

1:28:01.125 --> 1:28:02.625
I think I'm okay.

1:28:02.708 --> 1:28:04.166
Yeah.

1:28:05.458 --> 1:28:08.625
I'm letting myself have a cocktail
from time to time.

1:28:09.666 --> 1:28:11.625
I don't think I told you over the phone

1:28:11.708 --> 1:28:15.833
that I was letting myself have a cocktail
from time to time, huh?

1:28:15.916 --> 1:28:20.833
See, I realized that, um,
I'm not an alcoholic, so...

1:28:20.916 --> 1:28:22.625
Yeah.

1:28:22.708 --> 1:28:24.000
It's all good.

1:28:24.083 --> 1:28:26.208
You know, when the mood strikes me,

1:28:26.291 --> 1:28:28.625
I can enjoy a cocktail.

1:28:28.708 --> 1:28:32.083
And you can enjoy a cocktail
with your old man.

1:28:32.166 --> 1:28:34.083
Here we go.

1:28:34.166 --> 1:28:35.958
(The Voice clears throat)

1:28:37.041 --> 1:28:38.750
Thank you.

1:28:46.208 --> 1:28:50.041
Okay, so what are you doing?

1:28:51.166 --> 1:28:53.083
I'm a writer.

1:28:53.166 --> 1:28:55.083
I have a job at The Times.

1:29:00.458 --> 1:29:03.541
And, uh, how's your mother?

1:29:03.625 --> 1:29:05.875
She's good.

1:29:05.958 --> 1:29:07.666
Yeah?

1:29:11.583 --> 1:29:13.958
We're gonna go, uh, have dinner.

1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:16.500
At Kathy's.

1:29:18.041 --> 1:29:20.083
She's the new poontang. (chuckles)

1:29:22.083 --> 1:29:23.875
(The Voice clears throat)

1:29:25.083 --> 1:29:27.333
So... (sighs)

1:29:28.500 --> 1:29:29.916
Let's go.

1:29:45.666 --> 1:29:47.666
(dog barking in distance)

1:29:56.875 --> 1:29:58.500
(sighs)

1:30:14.291 --> 1:30:15.791
Hey.

1:30:18.958 --> 1:30:22.083
Well, I see y'all started
the party without me.

1:30:22.166 --> 1:30:25.416
The party started
a long time before I met you.

1:30:26.666 --> 1:30:30.125
This is my son, JR.

1:30:31.125 --> 1:30:33.541
What's the JR stand for?

1:30:34.625 --> 1:30:35.958
Junior.

1:30:36.958 --> 1:30:39.416
Very pleased to meet you, JR.

1:30:39.500 --> 1:30:41.250
Nice to meet you.

1:30:45.750 --> 1:30:47.166
What's for supper?

1:30:47.250 --> 1:30:49.291
I cooked a chicken,
got some vegetables.

1:30:49.375 --> 1:30:50.833
What time do you want to eat?

1:30:50.916 --> 1:30:53.375
Well, we're hungry now.

1:30:53.458 --> 1:30:55.833
What about that one?

1:30:55.916 --> 1:30:57.375
Hmm...

1:30:57.458 --> 1:31:00.333
-That is... Right here?
-Yeah, one... the piece has to go here.

1:31:00.416 --> 1:31:03.333
-This piece has to go here.
-Nice.

1:31:03.416 --> 1:31:05.583
What do you do with these
after you're done?

1:31:07.208 --> 1:31:09.291
Mama shellacs 'em and puts 'em up.

1:31:15.458 --> 1:31:18.208
-That's Venice.
-I know.

1:31:19.458 --> 1:31:21.416
Have you ever been there?

1:31:21.500 --> 1:31:22.916
Not yet.

1:31:24.041 --> 1:31:26.041
How do you get to go places?

1:31:29.041 --> 1:31:30.458
How?

1:31:34.333 --> 1:31:36.083
Do well in school.

1:31:38.333 --> 1:31:41.458
Do very well in school.

1:31:44.250 --> 1:31:47.500
That's the first thing I had to do.

1:31:51.625 --> 1:31:56.125
And sometimes that's all there is.

1:31:59.666 --> 1:32:01.166
I'm good at school.

1:32:01.250 --> 1:32:04.708
Yeah, if-if you do very well in school...

1:32:06.250 --> 1:32:07.541
...no one...

1:32:07.625 --> 1:32:10.083
Bet you write like nuns fuck.

1:32:19.375 --> 1:32:20.916
Where's this fucking chicken?

1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:23.541
Don't need any of
your mood swings after the day I had.

1:32:23.625 --> 1:32:25.791
What kind of fucking day
could you possibly have had?

1:32:25.875 --> 1:32:28.166
You out sucking cock
to pay for your goddamn chicken?

1:32:28.250 --> 1:32:30.250
-You know what, don't touch me!
-(thudding)

1:32:36.208 --> 1:32:37.833
Hey!

1:32:43.916 --> 1:32:47.541
Goddamn, you look like you had
some kind of a breakthrough.

1:32:49.375 --> 1:32:51.166
Like everything is...

1:32:52.750 --> 1:32:54.375
...falling into place.

1:32:54.458 --> 1:32:56.625
-Shut the fuck up.
-What did you say to me?

1:32:56.708 --> 1:32:59.041
I said shut the fuck up!

1:33:05.458 --> 1:33:07.708
You can't shut me up.

1:33:07.791 --> 1:33:10.000
I'm a broadcast professional.

1:33:12.041 --> 1:33:13.791
You weren't trying to shut me up

1:33:13.875 --> 1:33:15.916
when you were looking for me
on the radio dial.

1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:17.833
Fuck you.

1:33:17.916 --> 1:33:19.416
(The Voice exhales sharply)

1:33:19.500 --> 1:33:22.458
Man, you can't shut your daddy up.

1:33:22.541 --> 1:33:26.166
What are you gonna do
without the bad guy in your life?

1:33:26.250 --> 1:33:27.875
You're set.

1:33:29.791 --> 1:33:32.666
They'll all say that
you never had a chance.

1:33:43.791 --> 1:33:45.750
Where's your phone?

1:33:46.833 --> 1:33:49.458
("I Thought I Was a Child"
by Jackson Browne playing)

1:34:25.708 --> 1:34:27.708
(song continues over radio)

1:34:28.916 --> 1:34:30.750
Sorry about your father.

1:34:32.833 --> 1:34:34.500
He's not my father.

1:34:36.416 --> 1:34:38.208
You don't get to pick.

1:34:39.666 --> 1:34:41.041
Maybe.

1:34:44.333 --> 1:34:46.333
(dog barking in distance)

1:34:51.833 --> 1:34:53.458
Hi, honey.

1:34:55.375 --> 1:34:56.875
You're not gonna believe it.

1:34:56.958 --> 1:34:58.375
I got a great job.

1:34:58.458 --> 1:35:02.166
Your aunt, of all people, came through.

1:35:03.375 --> 1:35:05.333
It's in Westhampton. I got a desk.

1:35:05.416 --> 1:35:07.458
-Check the top?
-Yeah.

1:35:07.541 --> 1:35:10.250
They give you a book with a list
of phone numbers and addresses,

1:35:10.333 --> 1:35:14.333
and I talk to them about canceling
their whole life and getting term,

1:35:14.416 --> 1:35:18.291
putting the rest into an IRA
that builds tax-free.

1:35:19.333 --> 1:35:22.083
-How do I look?
-You look fantastic.

1:35:22.166 --> 1:35:24.166
Oh, God.

1:35:24.250 --> 1:35:27.083
I am gonna be late!

1:35:27.166 --> 1:35:30.458
They pay you a base salary, and then
you get a percentage of what you sell.

1:35:30.541 --> 1:35:32.125
There's some lasagna in the fridge.

1:35:32.208 --> 1:35:34.458
Leave some for Charlie.
Your grandpa already ate. I love you.

1:35:34.541 --> 1:35:35.625
-Okay.
-Wish me luck.

1:35:35.708 --> 1:35:37.916
-Good luck.
-(sighs)

1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.208
You sure this looks okay?

1:35:42.333 --> 1:35:44.333
Yeah. You look perfect.

1:35:46.625 --> 1:35:48.166
(chuckles)

1:35:52.541 --> 1:35:54.500
(chuckles softly)

1:35:54.583 --> 1:35:56.791
Your mother's settled, you know?

1:35:56.875 --> 1:35:58.416
Selling insurance.

1:35:58.500 --> 1:36:00.125
("Different Drum" by Stone Poneys playing)

1:36:00.208 --> 1:36:02.625
-Somebody's got to sell insurance, right?
-Yeah.

1:36:02.708 --> 1:36:05.375
Some of them are happy, probably.

1:36:05.458 --> 1:36:08.625
But I think Yale mostly took care
of her anxieties.

1:36:08.708 --> 1:36:10.125
(laughs)

1:36:10.208 --> 1:36:13.541
It's not my place to judge
what she's looking for, but...

1:36:13.625 --> 1:36:15.541
you know, I'd say she's all right.

1:36:15.625 --> 1:36:17.750
Yeah, hope so.

1:36:18.833 --> 1:36:20.708
What's all your stuff doing here?

1:36:21.708 --> 1:36:23.416
I'm going to Manhattan.

1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:25.625
It's time. Wesley has a place.

1:36:26.708 --> 1:36:29.083
Well, if you're gonna be a writer,
you got to get a job.

1:36:29.166 --> 1:36:31.666
Yeah. I'm not sure what that is yet.

1:36:32.666 --> 1:36:34.208
Insurance is taken.

1:36:34.291 --> 1:36:35.833
(chuckles)

1:36:37.041 --> 1:36:39.291
It's America. Pick something.

1:36:42.291 --> 1:36:43.541
That everything?

1:36:44.625 --> 1:36:46.083
Yeah, that's it.

1:36:46.166 --> 1:36:47.666
-(keys jingling)

1:36:51.833 --> 1:36:53.625
Don't say I never gave you nothing.

1:37:07.416 --> 1:37:09.166
(song stops)

1:37:14.625 --> 1:37:16.375
(sighs, chuckles softly)

1:37:34.333 --> 1:37:36.166
Whoa.

1:37:36.250 --> 1:37:38.375
-You got to be fucking kidding me.
-Whoa.

1:37:38.458 --> 1:37:40.625
You old enough to drive this thing?

1:37:40.708 --> 1:37:43.291
-- Better treat her with respect.
-- Steering wheel is on the left.

1:37:43.375 --> 1:37:44.583
It's a man's car.

1:37:44.666 --> 1:37:45.958
You sure there's gas in it?

1:37:46.041 --> 1:37:48.208
I guess you think you're a man now, huh?

1:37:48.291 --> 1:37:49.500
You little punk.

1:37:53.416 --> 1:37:56.083
-It's un-fucking-believable.
-(door opens)

1:37:56.166 --> 1:37:58.541
-Guy thinks he's Elvis Presley, you know?
-Kid's not a kid.

1:38:03.791 --> 1:38:05.208
You guys never gave me a car.

1:38:05.291 --> 1:38:07.166
Actually, he owes me this fucking car.

1:38:07.250 --> 1:38:09.041
(engine starts)

1:38:09.125 --> 1:38:11.625
("Do It Again" by Steely Dan playing)

1:38:13.958 --> 1:38:16.250
Get the fuck out of here.

1:38:16.333 --> 1:38:17.791
We don't want ya.

1:38:20.083 --> 1:38:22.000
-Scram!
-(laughter)

1:38:23.041 --> 1:38:24.375
Don't come back!

1:38:24.458 --> 1:38:26.125
(indistinct shouting)

1:38:29.541 --> 1:38:32.583
When you set out
to be a lawyer, you go to law school.

1:38:32.666 --> 1:38:34.416
You get a diploma for your effort.

1:38:34.500 --> 1:38:36.083
You pass the bar.

1:38:36.166 --> 1:38:39.791
In the text, it declares you
officially a lawyer.

1:38:39.875 --> 1:38:42.083
That's how most jobs work.

1:38:42.166 --> 1:38:44.666
But you're a writer
the minute you say you are.

1:38:44.750 --> 1:38:46.583
Nobody gives you a diploma.

1:38:46.666 --> 1:38:50.625
You have to prove it,
at least to yourself.

1:38:50.708 --> 1:38:53.916
On that day, driving to Manhattan--

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:58.291
stashies in my wallet,
Uncle Charlie's car--

1:38:58.375 --> 1:39:00.833
that's the moment I knew I was a writer.

1:39:02.625 --> 1:39:06.375
And just my luck,
publishing was headed toward memoir.

1:43:37.500 --> 1:43:39.500
(song fades)

1:45:36.625 --> 1:45:38.625
(music ends)
