WEBVTT

00:02.176 --> 00:04.004
[Jughead] It's been almost
a year. Like the grown-ups
and it,

00:04.047 --> 00:06.180
we returned
to our haunted hometown

00:06.223 --> 00:10.358
and confronted
the darkest monsters
we'd ever faced... ourselves.

00:10.401 --> 00:14.666
We'd survived, but surviving
isn't the same as thriving,

00:14.710 --> 00:17.800
and none of us, it seemed,
were thriving.

00:19.932 --> 00:23.545
So how did it go?
Did you pass?

00:23.588 --> 00:27.070
I... almost passed.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.550
Uh, Reggie?

00:28.593 --> 00:30.073
No, I'm so sorry.

00:31.161 --> 00:32.423
But don't worry.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.164
You can take
the Series 7 exam again,

00:34.208 --> 00:36.297
and you'll be a fully licensed
stockbroker in no time.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.689
Yes.

00:37.733 --> 00:40.649
Or I was thinking

00:40.692 --> 00:43.695
we could open a casino
here in town.

00:46.263 --> 00:47.656
What are you talking about?

00:47.699 --> 00:49.179
Don't you remember
how much fun we had

00:49.223 --> 00:50.833
running games at La Bonne Nuit?

00:52.530 --> 00:55.533
I hold very fond memories
of that time, Reggie.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.753
But I have decided

00:57.796 --> 00:59.842
that after
the school year ends,

00:59.885 --> 01:01.235
I'm going back to New York.

01:01.844 --> 01:02.758
Really?

01:04.020 --> 01:05.369
What about Carrot Top?

01:10.374 --> 01:13.464
Archie and I... are no more.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.424
Oh.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.861
He understands that
my future's in New York.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.611
Well, glad to see I'm not
the only one day-drinking.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.701
Are you here alone?

01:32.744 --> 01:33.745
You just missed Jackson.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.182
He moved back home.

01:35.225 --> 01:38.054
Oh, thank you.
Eric's such a good guy.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.621
Yeah.

01:39.664 --> 01:41.536
Is that why you look so sad?

01:41.579 --> 01:42.711
[chuckles]

01:42.754 --> 01:45.061
No, I'm happy for him.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.106
I'm sure we'll see him again.

01:47.977 --> 01:52.112
I, uh I don't know
if you heard,

01:52.155 --> 01:53.765
but Veronica and I broke up.

01:53.809 --> 01:54.679
For good this time.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.594
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.380
What happened?

01:59.423 --> 02:00.816
Seven years happened.
[chuckles]

02:02.296 --> 02:03.775
We became different people.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.170
Ronnie belongs in New York,

02:07.214 --> 02:08.824
and I belong here,
in Riverdale.

02:10.521 --> 02:12.871
I'm reopening
Andrews Construction.

02:12.915 --> 02:16.223
Oh, well looks like
we're going to be neighbors
for the foreseeable future.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.008
I just got permission
to reopen
the Riverdale FBI office.

02:19.051 --> 02:21.880
Because by the way,
you're now talking

02:21.924 --> 02:23.665
to Special Agent
Betty Cooper officially.

02:23.708 --> 02:26.363
-Wow, that's amazing.
-Yeah.

02:26.407 --> 02:27.756
When's the graduation?

02:27.799 --> 02:30.541
And can we go?

02:30.585 --> 02:35.067
I missed it, but it's okay.
I got my diploma in the mail.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.287
Well, damn.

02:37.331 --> 02:38.549
Can I at least pay
for the next round?

02:38.593 --> 02:39.768
Sure.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.553
[Jughead] And here
I thought your days

02:42.597 --> 02:44.686
of summoning me
were over, Waldo.

02:44.729 --> 02:47.689
The worm turns, Mr. Jones.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.343
Some of the students
are interested

02:49.386 --> 02:51.301
in restarting
the student newspaper,

02:51.345 --> 02:52.781
The Blue and Gold.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.783
Trouble is, none of
our current faculty

02:54.826 --> 02:56.567
have the bandwidth
to supervise it.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.137
You want me to?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.312
Yes.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.314
What do you say, Mr. Jones?

03:04.358 --> 03:06.273
I say, get me that rewrite.

03:06.316 --> 03:09.580
Cameron, put the word out
that She-Wolf of Wall Street

03:09.624 --> 03:12.104
is coming back to take a bite
out of the Big Apple.

03:12.148 --> 03:13.497
What, right now?

03:14.542 --> 03:16.326
I wouldn't do that, Ronnie.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.720
Why not? You said I could
come back whenever I wanted.

03:18.763 --> 03:21.984
Yeah, but that was before
you killed Chad in cold blood.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.899
That was self-defense, Cameron.

03:23.942 --> 03:26.945
I'm sure. But I doubt
any firm in town
would be willing to hire

03:26.989 --> 03:29.252
the black widow of Wall Street,

03:29.296 --> 03:31.559
which is what
everyone's calling you.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.866
Maybe call me again
in six months.

03:35.606 --> 03:36.868
[call ends]

03:46.443 --> 03:48.315
Now are you sure you're not
scared to be toiling away

03:48.358 --> 03:49.533
down here, dear Britta?

03:49.577 --> 03:51.709
Not at all, Miss Blossom.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.755
And the physical labor
will keep me in shape
for football next season.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.322
Glad to hear it.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.324
Palladium is the missing piece
in my ministry,

03:57.367 --> 03:59.326
the fabled Fifth Element.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.892
It's the bridge
between the physical
and spiritual worlds,

04:00.936 --> 04:02.372
and it will grant me
power over both.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.983
-That sounds so cool.
-Indeed.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.594
All right, Come come.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.378
It's time to wipe the soot
off our faces for the day

04:08.422 --> 04:09.771
before we're late
for the big surprise.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.995
Keep 'em closed.
Keep 'em closed.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.997
You know I don't like
surprises, right?

04:19.041 --> 04:20.303
Well, that really sucks.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.174
Because...

04:22.218 --> 04:23.350
Surprise!

04:23.393 --> 04:25.656
Oh, my God, you guys.

04:25.700 --> 04:29.399
Here's to Quantico's
latest and greatest
field officer,

04:29.443 --> 04:32.228
Agent Betty Cooper.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.665
-Congratulations, sweetheart.
-Thank you.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.580
Speech! Speech!

04:36.624 --> 04:38.147
Speech! Speech!

04:38.190 --> 04:39.453
-Speech!
-Oh, wow!

04:39.496 --> 04:42.456
Okay, I was not expecting...
this.

04:42.499 --> 04:46.851
But it means more to me
than I could ever express.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.898
So thank you.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.813
It's been a rough year. But...

04:53.293 --> 04:55.904
I love you all.

04:55.947 --> 05:00.038
Elizabeth, you've given us
a lifetime of reasons
to be proud of you.

05:00.082 --> 05:01.213
This one takes the cake.

05:01.257 --> 05:02.867
And speaking of cake...

05:04.826 --> 05:05.914
[Betty laughing]

05:10.962 --> 05:12.355
So what does this mean, B?

05:12.399 --> 05:14.139
It means I'm staying
in Riverdale,

05:14.183 --> 05:15.924
just like I promised my mom.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.752
God knows there's
enough crime here

05:17.795 --> 05:21.408
to last me several lifetimes.

05:21.451 --> 05:25.281
Well, I don't know if you've
heard about me and Archie.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.240
I did, V. I'm sorry.

05:28.284 --> 05:31.026
But I'm sure you're excited
to get back to your old life

05:31.069 --> 05:32.984
in New York,
even though we'll miss you.

05:36.684 --> 05:39.382
Should we head
back to the diner?

05:39.426 --> 05:42.080
I actually asked Delores
to cover the night for us.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.168
Oh, really?

05:43.212 --> 05:45.040
And why is that?

05:45.083 --> 05:48.739
Well, I figured that we didn't
actually get to have our date

05:48.783 --> 05:51.829
-at Cucina Sacasa, so...
-Oh, true.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.527
I could definitely go for
some Italian right now.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.180
-Right now?
-Mmm-hmm.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.059
Well, glad you're
doing better, Alice.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.757
Yeah, it doesn't
get any easier,

06:06.801 --> 06:08.368
but every day
it's hurts a little less.

06:10.021 --> 06:13.373
You, um... You getting
out of the house at all?

06:14.896 --> 06:17.028
I'm trying to.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.378
Why? Do you have
something in mind, Frank?

06:19.074 --> 06:21.032
Uh... [chuckles]

06:39.050 --> 06:40.400
I actually have some news.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.966
So Principal Weatherbee
asked me to, uh,

06:42.010 --> 06:43.577
come back and run
the school paper.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.926
Oh!

06:44.969 --> 06:47.015
And as long as
I don't mess it up,

06:47.058 --> 06:49.887
he said that I could
start possibly
teaching again in the fall.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.585
Wow.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.588
Maybe then you'd be able
to move out of Archie's garage.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.372
Aw, man, I was just
starting to love

06:56.416 --> 06:58.853
the smell of mold
and turpentine.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.726
You know, um,

07:02.770 --> 07:06.469
if you're going to be
working full time in the fall,

07:06.513 --> 07:08.689
that's also when
my apartment's lease is up.

07:10.865 --> 07:13.694
You and me? Cohabitating?

07:13.737 --> 07:14.999
[cell phone chimes]

07:15.783 --> 07:17.480
It's Delores.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.568
Oh, it's probably just
the ice machine on the fritz.

07:19.526 --> 07:20.657
Hey, Delores, What's up?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.355
What?

07:26.837 --> 07:29.753
-Got any threes?
-Go fish, bish.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.407
[bell ringing]

07:32.582 --> 07:34.192
[cell phones chiming]

07:34.236 --> 07:36.064
Holy crap! Pop's is on fire.

07:38.936 --> 07:41.156
Oh, what the hell?

07:41.199 --> 07:42.810
They're slashed
on this side, too.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.073
Okay, guys, get the spares.
Fangs, get the jack.

07:47.554 --> 07:48.685
[fire crackling]

08:00.741 --> 08:01.655
[screaming]

08:21.326 --> 08:22.676
I'm so sorry, Tabitha.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.635
We should have
gotten here faster.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.202
Archie, come on.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.552
You did everything you could.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.336
You and your fireman
are the only reason

08:31.380 --> 08:32.947
this place is even
standing at all.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.383
It's true.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.515
I've never seen
tires changed so fast.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.826
How do I call my grandpa
in Florida?

08:44.001 --> 08:45.394
And what do I tell him?

08:45.437 --> 08:48.528
That our family business
went up in flames?

08:48.571 --> 08:50.138
Delores said
that it was a Ghoulie

08:50.181 --> 08:51.618
who threw
the Molotov cocktail.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.576
A Ghoulie? To what end?
What's his motive?

08:53.620 --> 08:55.578
Wasn't his motive.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.145
I can pretty much guarantee

08:57.188 --> 08:59.582
that Ghoulie was acting
on someone else's behalf.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.584
Give you three guesses who.

09:01.628 --> 09:02.803
Your dad?

09:04.456 --> 09:07.024
I can't believe I ever
worked for that sorry SOB.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.723
If the scumbag
who torches places a Ghoulie,

09:09.766 --> 09:12.682
Fangs and I'll take care of it.
We'll get confirmation.

09:12.726 --> 09:13.640
Yeah, do that, Toni.

09:14.728 --> 09:15.859
But I don't need confirmation.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.252
I don't think any of us do.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.906
I mean, who else
would set fire to Pop's

09:18.949 --> 09:20.734
and slashed our trucks' tires
before we get to it?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.354
I don't remember
ordering room service.

09:34.617 --> 09:37.185
Hiram Lodge,
you are under arrest.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.274
You have the right
to remain silent.

09:39.317 --> 09:41.711
Anything you say can
and will be used
against you in a court of law.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.626
You have the right
to an attorney.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.628
If you cannot afford
an attorney, one will be
provided for you.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.977
Oh, I can afford one,

09:47.021 --> 09:48.675
and he'll have me out
before dinner.

09:57.509 --> 09:58.728
Woodward and Bernstein.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.948
Seymour Hersh, Ronan Farrow,

10:00.991 --> 10:02.210
What do these people
have in common?

10:02.253 --> 10:04.516
Uh, they're all journalists.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.649
Yes, they are journalists.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.520
But more specifically,
they are journalists

10:08.564 --> 10:11.654
who courageously
spoke truth to power.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.264
Freedom of the press.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.179
This is one of the most
basic building blocks

10:15.223 --> 10:18.008
in a healthy
functioning society,

10:18.052 --> 10:19.749
and we might take it
for granted out here,

10:19.793 --> 10:21.272
but there are places
around the world

10:21.316 --> 10:24.058
where information
is controlled by dictators.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.755
And the truth is shaped

10:25.799 --> 10:28.062
to serve those
who are in power.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.630
Kind of like what
the Lodge Ledger
does in Riverdale.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.720
Yes.

10:33.763 --> 10:34.982
Yeah, exactly like that.

10:36.984 --> 10:40.030
Hiram was booked,
but he's right.
He'll beat the charges.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.903
There's nothing we can do
to conclusively
link him to the arson.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.557
Not yet,
but Toni's gonna
find that Ghoulie.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.777
-In the meantime...
-Let's search
his SoDale office.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.170
There's got to be
something in there

10:49.213 --> 10:50.737
that ties him to this crime

10:50.780 --> 10:53.391
or literally, any other crime
at this point.

10:53.435 --> 10:54.958
And we'd be looking for...

10:55.002 --> 10:58.614
Shady contracts, financials,
illicit receipts.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.529
I mean it's not
really my bailiwick.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.574
Me neither. We need someone
who speaks that language.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.533
Who also wants
to take Hiram down.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.449
[both] Veronica.

-Fangs, turn up

-Okay. Okay, okay.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.255
Okay, fine.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.692
I'll tell you.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.868
It was Hiram Lodge.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.218
Not surprised.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.569
Why would you agree?

11:40.612 --> 11:42.789
Torching Pop's,
which is right on top
of the Whyte Wyrm.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.487
My place.

11:45.530 --> 11:48.229
Why would you risk
a war with the Serpents
to help out Hiram Lodge?

11:48.795 --> 11:49.621
A war?

11:50.622 --> 11:51.667

and having babies.

You've gone soft.

And Hiram said that
as soon as Pop's was razed,

12:02.634 --> 12:04.985

to take back the town,

12:05.028 --> 12:06.551

what we deserve.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.318
[Betty] What are
we looking at, Vee?

12:34.362 --> 12:35.667
According to these documents,

12:35.711 --> 12:38.105
my father
incorporated SoDale,

12:38.148 --> 12:40.324
even though
it's only a muddy field.

12:40.368 --> 12:41.891
Great.
So he's done with Riverdale?

12:41.935 --> 12:43.240
On the contrary.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.547
Now that SoDale
is legally a town,

12:45.590 --> 12:47.854
he can petition the courts
to redraw its borders

12:47.897 --> 12:50.813
and absorb
all unincorporated lands.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.075
In other words,
he's going to annex

12:52.119 --> 12:53.642
the former
township of Riverdale,

12:53.685 --> 12:55.687
claim eminent domain
and grab it for himself.

the Palladium mines?

the wild, wild west.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.258
Let me take this paperwork
back with me to the FBI office.

13:01.302 --> 13:03.130
We'll see
if this is even legal,

13:03.173 --> 13:04.871
and if it isn't,
we'll start building
a case against him.

-It's Toni.
-[Toni] It's like
we suspected.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.227
Hiram paid the Ghoulie
to burn down Pop's.

13:13.270 --> 13:15.055
And not just Pop's,

13:15.098 --> 13:16.970
but all the fires
that have been
breaking out recently.

13:17.013 --> 13:20.843
Hiram promised the Ghoulies
the burned husk of the town.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.802
-All he cares about is--
-The mines.

13:24.891 --> 13:29.156
I'm sorry,
Toni, Fangs, Archie.

13:29.199 --> 13:32.637
Yet again,
I find myself apologizing
for my father's actions.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.639
Yeah, well, we don't want
an apology.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.559
We'll take care of him.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.474
No offense, Veronica,
but I don't think

13:43.518 --> 13:45.302
you're going
to be willing to do
what needs to be done.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.176
Yes, we will.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.701
Archie and I both will.

13:52.744 --> 13:55.704
[scoffs]
And what are the Serpents
supposed to do,

13:55.747 --> 13:57.358

13:57.401 --> 13:59.012
Actually, Fangs,
what we really need
is someone

13:59.055 --> 14:00.752
to go out
and collect signatures,

14:00.796 --> 14:02.145
so I can reincorporate
the town.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.755
[Toni] Are you kidding me?

14:03.799 --> 14:05.845
The Serpents
don't run errands, Archie.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.324
Of course not, Toni.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.500
But this is
a different kind of fighting.

14:09.544 --> 14:12.373
As long as Riverdale
is unincorporated,
we're sitting ducks.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.854
And I'm not sure
we've done enough
to inspire the families

14:14.897 --> 14:17.769
that Riverdale is still
worth resurrecting.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.597
So we've got
to make our play,

14:19.641 --> 14:21.251
that means getting
51% of people

14:21.295 --> 14:23.514
living in our borders
to sign an endorsement.

14:24.907 --> 14:28.041
Fine.
We'll rally the troops.

14:28.084 --> 14:32.959

of Hiram, we will, our way.

needs to happen.

but he refuses to give up.

Let's say he escaped
from his jail cell.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.308

looking for him?

15:19.483 --> 15:22.051
Certainly not my mother.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.053
And not Hermosa.
She feels betrayed
by him, too.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.056
And Sheriff Keller wouldn't.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.103
And Betty would make sure
the FBI doesn't either.

15:31.843 --> 15:35.151
We could take Hiram out
to the maple barrens.

15:35.195 --> 15:38.372
It could be the last thing
we do together.

15:38.415 --> 15:42.028
Somehow
that would be fitting.

What would you say
about being my deputy
full-time, son?

23:40.462 --> 23:41.985
I think that would be
an honor, Dad.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.771
But I can't.

23:44.814 --> 23:47.164
Because I've decided
once the school year's over,

23:47.208 --> 23:49.079
I want to give New York
and Broadway another shot.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.821
-Oh.
-I've been thinking about it
ever since Josie visited,

23:51.865 --> 23:54.302
and it's something
that I've got to do now,

23:54.345 --> 23:56.652
or I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.439
-To new beginnings.
-To new beginnings.

24:03.093 --> 24:06.357
I just drove past
the Town Hall,
and it is a fire trap,

24:06.401 --> 24:09.230
so we'll host
the community meeting
at the El Royale.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.405
How's it going
with the signatures?

24:10.449 --> 24:12.363
We're not at 51% yet,

24:12.407 --> 24:14.235
but we still got a crew out
pounding the pavement.

24:14.278 --> 24:16.193
Okay, great.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.326
But, Archie,
a lot of the Serpents
have been reporting back.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.675
People are asking
what kind of town

24:19.719 --> 24:21.503
the new Riverdale
is going to be.

24:21.547 --> 24:24.114
And they want to know
before they agree
to reincorporate.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.899
Like, is there
going to be a mayor?

24:25.942 --> 24:27.378
If so, who?

24:27.422 --> 24:28.597
Yeah, I've been
turning that over, too.

24:30.338 --> 24:31.644
I know
who I would vote for.

24:33.254 --> 24:35.517
You, Toni.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.085
-Would you do it?
-What, mayor?

24:38.128 --> 24:40.391
I mean, Archie, I can't.

24:40.435 --> 24:42.132
I don't have
the bandwidth.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.090
I understand.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.310
-Fangs?
-Hell no.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.356
I just got crowned
Serpent King.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.619
Congratulations, bro.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.360
In that case,
why don't you guys focus

24:52.403 --> 24:54.754
on getting people
to the El Royale
for the town hall.

24:54.797 --> 24:58.018
And we'll have answers
for people's questions, Toni,
I promise.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.034
[gasps]

25:15.035 --> 25:16.384
[Britta] Miss Blossom.

25:16.427 --> 25:17.341
Miss Blossom.

25:18.255 --> 25:19.169
Look what I found.

25:20.388 --> 25:23.260
Skeletons, Nana.
Human skeletons.

25:23.304 --> 25:26.568
Our mines are choked
with God-and-Jason knows
how many.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.919
Brittania and I discovered
a veritable bone yard.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.095
Since you seem to know where
all the bodies are buried,

25:32.139 --> 25:33.749
I'm assuming
you know about these.

25:33.793 --> 25:37.840
Yes, I was wondering
if they'd ever be found.

25:37.884 --> 25:38.885
The Forgotten.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.061
"The Forgotten"?

25:51.288 --> 25:55.249
It all began
with an ancestor of ours,

25:55.292 --> 25:57.730
one Abigail Blossom.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.995
The year was 1890.

26:02.038 --> 26:03.953
Thornhill still stood,
of course,

26:03.997 --> 26:07.087
but it was
a girl's school then.

26:07.130 --> 26:10.873
Riverdale was a hateful
and backward place then.

26:10.917 --> 26:14.529
The townspeople were
suspicious of Abigail,

26:14.573 --> 26:16.313
who had no husband

26:16.357 --> 26:18.794
and no intention of taking one.

26:18.838 --> 26:23.190
They'd harassed Abigail
and the girls in her care
for months.

26:23.233 --> 26:26.062
They knew there was
palladium to be found

26:26.106 --> 26:28.325
in the mines under her groves
and wanted

26:28.369 --> 26:29.457
to buy them from her.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.415
But she refused.

26:31.459 --> 26:34.854
So, they decided
to steal it instead.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.118
[indistinct shouting]

26:38.161 --> 26:40.424
[Nana Rose]
They came to Thornhill

26:40.468 --> 26:43.602
armed with pitchforks
and torches.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.735
[banging on door]

26:46.779 --> 26:48.084
-[Abigail] No!
-[man] There she is!

26:48.128 --> 26:50.217
No! No! No!

26:50.260 --> 26:51.653
[indistinct shouting]

26:56.789 --> 26:59.139
[Nana Rose] Oh, they
had it all planned out.

26:59.182 --> 27:02.533
They accused her
of being a witch.

27:02.577 --> 27:06.146
And they burned her
at the stake

27:06.189 --> 27:08.931
in the groves
surrounding Thornhill.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.634
[screaming]

27:18.462 --> 27:20.160
Who, Nana?

27:20.203 --> 27:23.946
Who were these
vicious hooligans?
These killers?

27:23.990 --> 27:26.383
Brace yourself, child.

27:26.427 --> 27:30.126
The primary conspirators were
the ancestors

27:30.170 --> 27:33.086
of your so-called compatriots.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.698
Archibald Andrews,

27:36.742 --> 27:39.440
Jedediah Jones,

27:39.483 --> 27:41.050
and Beatrice Cooper.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.185
With her dying words,

27:45.228 --> 27:47.927
she cursed them and the others,

27:47.970 --> 27:50.756
damning them to tragedy,
as well.

27:51.626 --> 27:53.149
After her death,

27:53.193 --> 27:55.282
the townspeople claimed
the mines

27:55.325 --> 27:57.066
and began to dig for palladium.

27:58.024 --> 27:59.678
But there was a collapse,

27:59.721 --> 28:02.681
killing and entombing
an entire generation

28:02.724 --> 28:06.423
of Riverdale's
fathers and sons.

28:06.467 --> 28:09.775
Some say
the collapse was caused

28:09.818 --> 28:11.602
by Abigail's curse.

28:13.082 --> 28:16.825
-Nana, how do you
know all this?
-Why,

28:16.869 --> 28:20.046
it's written
in Abigail's journal.

28:20.089 --> 28:23.614
Would you like
to read it, child?

28:23.658 --> 28:25.834
I shouldn't
have called you, Grandpa.

28:25.878 --> 28:29.185
It wasn't my intention that you
would come up from Florida.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.318
The worst part of all this is

28:31.361 --> 28:33.973
that I feel like I've
let you down.

28:35.235 --> 28:36.802
What are you talking about?

28:36.845 --> 28:38.499
You defied your father

28:38.542 --> 28:40.066
and took over
a struggling business.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.330
And don't forget, I know

28:43.373 --> 28:46.942
the debt you assumed when you
took over the diner.

28:46.986 --> 28:49.336
You've been paying it down
every month.

28:49.379 --> 28:52.121
None of that matters
if we can't pay for repairs.

28:52.165 --> 28:55.211
We'll try to get
some of Hiram's leftovers.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.779
And I'll cover the rest
with my retirement money.

28:57.823 --> 29:00.782
What? Grandpa, no,
I'm not letting you do that.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.350
I'd be doing it for me
as much as you.

29:03.393 --> 29:06.745
I miss the adrenaline
of working.

29:06.788 --> 29:07.702
I miss my customers.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.749
So I'm giving you my nest egg

29:11.575 --> 29:13.621
on the condition

29:13.664 --> 29:16.276
that you let me come back
to Pop's and work with you.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.106
Grandpa, I would love that.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.632
You know, we could propose a
civil council.

29:24.675 --> 29:27.504
It's a system that works,
and it's fair.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.464
Well, if fair is the criteria,
then we should govern
by committee.

29:30.507 --> 29:33.162
We can hold town meetings
for every big decision.

29:33.206 --> 29:36.035
It's purely democratic,
and everyone would
get an equal say.

29:36.078 --> 29:37.819
That would be anarchy.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.908
What if we had a mayor who had
to answer to a council?

29:39.952 --> 29:41.692
Best of both worlds.

29:41.736 --> 29:44.173
I think the mayor
is a non-starter
for a lot of people

29:44.217 --> 29:46.872
after the way
my father abused his power.

29:46.915 --> 29:49.178
[Cheryl]
How ironic yet fitting.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.614
The descendants of those who
committed Riverdale's

29:50.658 --> 29:53.139
original sin
debating its future.

29:53.182 --> 29:55.054
Well, I refuse
to allow you four

29:55.097 --> 29:58.100
to perpetuate any
further cycles of violence
and bloodshed.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.235
Cheryl, what the hell
are you talking about?

30:05.194 --> 30:07.240
[Veronica] So, to be clear,

30:07.283 --> 30:09.677
none of my
ancestors were involved.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.027
No. But the same can't be said
for your three conspirators,

30:12.071 --> 30:13.768
who killed my dear Abigail.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.771
Therefore, I'm demanding
a formal apology

30:16.815 --> 30:18.860
and acknowledgement
of this travesty.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.470
Publicly and immediately.

30:20.514 --> 30:23.909
Cheryl, this story
really is tragic,

30:23.952 --> 30:26.650
but those are our ancestors,
not us.

30:26.694 --> 30:28.261
Not to mention,

30:28.304 --> 30:29.915
we need everyone's support
at tomorrow's meeting.

30:29.958 --> 30:32.569
If we lead
with this crazy story,

30:32.613 --> 30:34.702
it might distract people
from the task at hand.

30:34.745 --> 30:36.356
-Reincorporation.
-[Cheryl scoffs]

30:36.399 --> 30:38.619
I've spent years atoning
for the sins of my ancestors.

30:38.662 --> 30:42.188
And now you want me
to forget about it and move on?

30:42.231 --> 30:44.146
Only until the town is stable.

30:44.190 --> 30:45.713
Cheryl, please,

30:45.756 --> 30:47.454
this is Riverdale's one chance
to be reborn.

30:47.497 --> 30:49.238
[scoffing] "Reborn"?

30:49.282 --> 30:52.111
This town sits over
a vast graveyard
of dead miners.

30:52.154 --> 30:53.808
The roots of the trees
in my groves have,

30:53.852 --> 30:56.202
over time, become entwined
with those corpses.

30:56.245 --> 30:58.334
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

30:58.378 --> 31:00.206
For decades,
the trees have been nourished

31:00.249 --> 31:01.903
by the poisonous dead.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.471
My sap, my syrup,
the very life-blood

31:04.514 --> 31:06.429
of Riverdale, has been polluted
by the remains

31:06.473 --> 31:08.954
of so many fathers and sons.

31:08.997 --> 31:11.391
The only chance this town has
of being reborn

31:11.434 --> 31:13.872
is for you to come clean
and beg for my...

31:13.915 --> 31:15.569
my forgiveness.

31:17.527 --> 31:18.920
See you at the meeting.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.400
And I pray
you do the right thing.

31:24.926 --> 31:27.711
Okay. Today,
our families and neighbors

31:27.755 --> 31:28.974
are going to decide on

31:29.017 --> 31:31.541
whether or not
to reincorporate this town.

31:31.585 --> 31:32.803
Whether Riverdale lives...

31:34.109 --> 31:36.459
or whether Riverdale dies.

31:36.503 --> 31:39.201
Regardless, we will be ready
to publish.

31:39.245 --> 31:42.770
But not as the Blue and Gold.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.641
We are now
the Riverdale Choice.

31:44.685 --> 31:47.775
A new, free press
for all of Riverdale.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.820
Whatever happens in our town,
we're gonna be there

31:49.864 --> 31:53.346
to report on it,
truthfully and without bias.

31:53.389 --> 31:55.739
And whoever is in charge,

31:55.783 --> 31:58.394
we will hold them accountable,

31:58.438 --> 32:00.570
even if they're our friends.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.181
Especially if they're
our friends.

32:02.224 --> 32:04.966
Okay. We have a town meeting
to cover. Let's go.

32:07.969 --> 32:09.884
Reginald,

32:09.928 --> 32:12.800
I've been thinking about
your idea for a casino
in Riverdale,

32:12.843 --> 32:16.369
and I think we
should go for it.

32:16.412 --> 32:18.458
Really? What about New York?

32:18.501 --> 32:21.940
We could go back to New York
and to be two nameless,

32:21.983 --> 32:24.768
faceless traders
on Wall Street, yes.

32:24.812 --> 32:27.249
Or we could stay in Riverdale

32:27.293 --> 32:29.773
and the king and queen
of the roost,

32:29.817 --> 32:32.037
working for ourselves,
calling the shots.

32:33.647 --> 32:35.605
You're preaching to the choir.

32:35.649 --> 32:40.132
And I was thinking
maybe we can use
Pearls and Posh as a cover.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.655
We may not even have
to do that.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.529
All right. Could I get
everyone's attention, please?

32:46.573 --> 32:47.878
We'd like
to begin the proceedings.

32:53.319 --> 32:54.929
Now, some of you
knew my father.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.801
He believed in Riverdale,

32:57.845 --> 32:59.803
not because it was perfect,

32:59.847 --> 33:01.631
but because he saw
the potential in it.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.331
And tonight we're not looking
to reincorporate

33:05.374 --> 33:07.724
a town that was, but a town

33:07.768 --> 33:10.901
that might one day be,
with the proper leadership.

33:10.945 --> 33:13.034
Which is why, as of tonight,

33:13.078 --> 33:15.428
we're hoping
that it won't be a mayor
who leads us into the future,

33:15.471 --> 33:18.909
but instead, a council of four
who will guide us

33:18.953 --> 33:20.389
-every step of the way.
-[Cheryl] Halt.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.609
I've heard enough.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.176
And who, pray tell

33:24.219 --> 33:26.569
will comprise this council
of four narcissists?

33:26.613 --> 33:30.660
Let me guess. You, Betty,
Veronica and Jughead.

33:30.704 --> 33:33.446
Actually, we were going
to propose the council be...

33:35.143 --> 33:38.016
Tabitha Tate, Toni Topaz,

33:39.104 --> 33:40.148
Alice Smith,

33:41.671 --> 33:42.846
and my Uncle Frank.

33:44.544 --> 33:46.067
I see.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.156
And what about
the past, Archie?

33:48.200 --> 33:50.506
Cheryl, tonight's
not about the past,

33:50.550 --> 33:52.204
-but I promise you--
-No!

33:52.247 --> 33:54.510
No more empty promises.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.080
Let the official, public record
show that from this moment on,

33:59.124 --> 34:00.777
Thornhill and her lands

34:00.821 --> 34:03.476
shall cede from the corrupt
township of Riverdale.

34:03.519 --> 34:04.912
Whatever happens tonight,

34:04.955 --> 34:07.132
you lot will have
no jurisdiction over it

34:07.175 --> 34:08.611
or its blessed inhabitants.

34:08.655 --> 34:11.005
-Cheryl, come on.
-Nay, cousin!

34:11.049 --> 34:13.268
What is decreed is decreed.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.140
Ta-ta. Come along, Brittania.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.186
[indistinct chatter]

34:20.841 --> 34:22.451
Just to be clear,

34:22.495 --> 34:25.541
these four nominees
have deep roots in Riverdale.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.804
And they'll fight
to make it better, stronger

34:27.848 --> 34:29.458
and more inclusive than ever.

34:29.502 --> 34:30.720
They will each swear an oath

34:30.764 --> 34:32.331
to put Riverdale's
collective needs

34:32.374 --> 34:34.115
before any single individual.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.943
Now, is there
anyone here tonight

34:35.986 --> 34:37.597
that opposes these
four nominees?

34:40.687 --> 34:41.731
In that case,

34:41.775 --> 34:43.385
all in favor to reincorporate

34:43.429 --> 34:45.561
the township of Riverdale
under this council of four?

34:49.783 --> 34:51.872
Unanimous.

34:51.915 --> 34:53.221
Along with
the signatures collected,

34:54.092 --> 34:55.876
the ayes have it.

34:55.919 --> 34:58.661
Riverdale is officially
back on the map.

35:11.021 --> 35:13.763
At the risk of putting the cart
before the horse,

35:13.807 --> 35:17.158
Reggie and I have an idea
for Riverdale. A big idea.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.378
That we think
you're really gonna love.

35:19.421 --> 35:20.640
Okay, what is it?

35:20.683 --> 35:22.468
Picture, if you will,

35:22.511 --> 35:25.166
a stunning,
full-service, white-glove,

35:25.210 --> 35:28.387
family-friendly casino
within Riverdale's borders,

35:28.430 --> 35:30.954
which will provide a slew
of new jobs for our residents,

35:30.998 --> 35:33.609
as well as a fresh,
robust cash flow.

35:33.653 --> 35:35.959
With our expertise
and your support,

35:36.003 --> 35:38.136
our little town could be
the next...

35:38.962 --> 35:40.399
Atlantic City.

35:40.442 --> 35:42.270
So, you're wanting
to turn Riverdale

35:42.314 --> 35:44.707
into the modern day
Sodom and Gomorrah?

35:46.753 --> 35:48.450
Look, we really appreciate
your enthusiasm.

35:48.494 --> 35:49.886
It's just that
we have traffic lights

35:49.930 --> 35:51.236
and potholes to fix first--

35:51.279 --> 35:53.890
Not to mention Pop's.

35:53.934 --> 35:55.979
I think what we're saying
is that we're intrigued,

35:56.023 --> 35:58.199
but how about you
bring a full proposal

35:58.243 --> 36:00.984
to next month's meeting?
And we'll take it from there.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.858
Okay. See you next month.

36:12.953 --> 36:14.955
So...

36:14.998 --> 36:17.175
Riverdale lives
to fight another day.

36:18.828 --> 36:21.091
[chuckles] Nice job, Arch.

36:21.135 --> 36:22.180
Yeah, we'll see.

36:24.269 --> 36:27.315
What about Cheryl?
Should we be worried?

36:27.359 --> 36:29.143
No, she'll come around.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.232
-Yeah.
-What you doing later tonight?

36:33.974 --> 36:35.149
[Nana Rose] How did it go?

36:35.193 --> 36:37.238
Was our Abigail avenged?

36:37.282 --> 36:39.284
-Hardly, Nana.
-Oh.

36:39.327 --> 36:42.330
They don't give a whit
about the sins of the past.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.376
[sighs] Will Riverdale
ever learn?

36:44.419 --> 36:45.942
Well, perhaps.

36:45.986 --> 36:48.031
But they will need help.

36:48.075 --> 36:51.078
And Abigail must be honored.

36:52.035 --> 36:53.211
[Cheryl] What's that?

36:53.254 --> 36:56.083
The last words she ever spoke

36:56.126 --> 36:59.391
as she was being burned alive
at the stake.

37:00.696 --> 37:01.654
You mean the curse?

37:02.611 --> 37:04.918
Speak the speech, child.

37:04.961 --> 37:07.834
It will be a fitting
tribute to our ancestor.

37:14.449 --> 37:16.146
[Cheryl] It's only fitting that

37:16.190 --> 37:20.107
these words spoken at the end
of one Blossom chapter...

37:20.150 --> 37:23.241
shall be uttered
as a new one unfurls.

37:24.764 --> 37:26.244
From this day on,

37:26.287 --> 37:28.637
Thornhill will no longer
be home to a ministry,

37:28.681 --> 37:30.726
but to a school

37:30.770 --> 37:32.554
modeled after Abigail's.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.295
An academy for lost
and wayward girls.

37:36.079 --> 37:38.386
As Abigail herself once said
these words...

37:41.650 --> 37:43.130
"Archibald Andrews,

37:43.173 --> 37:45.698
Jedediah Jones,
and Beatrice Cooper.

37:45.741 --> 37:48.091
I repudiate you
with my dying breath.

37:48.135 --> 37:50.529
And in Satan's name,
I curse you.

37:50.572 --> 37:53.532
Burn me, but you will never
escape my wrath,

37:53.575 --> 37:55.316
nor Satan's.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.926
The unchained elements
of the power of darkness are

37:56.970 --> 37:58.537
lying in ambush.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.365
Beware.

38:00.408 --> 38:03.498
My revenge will strike down you
and your accursed houses.

38:03.542 --> 38:07.328
And I will bathe in the blood
of your sons and daughters.

38:07.372 --> 38:10.331
Immortal, I shall return,
again and again,

38:10.375 --> 38:12.507
to torment and destroy you."

38:12.551 --> 38:14.074
[Abigail] And destroy you!

38:48.195 --> 38:49.588
I think it's your
best work yet, Archie.

38:50.850 --> 38:52.547
Thanks, Alice.

38:52.591 --> 38:54.288
But I mean,
it's just a plywood sign.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.811
-[chuckles softly]
-Nah.

38:55.855 --> 38:57.465

done this year, Arch.

for wind today.

39:14.656 --> 39:16.354
[shivering] Ooh.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.660
This wind.

39:18.704 --> 39:21.533
Yeah, it feels like someone's
walking on my grave. Come on.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.060
Very good.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.279
From a classroom
to a boiler room.

39:29.323 --> 39:30.324
Only in Riverdale.

39:32.718 --> 39:34.415
How are we looking
back here, partner?

39:34.459 --> 39:36.765
Well, it's not
the Caesars Palace...

39:38.463 --> 39:39.507
but we'll get there.

39:40.421 --> 39:41.466
Of that, Reggie,

I have no doubt.
