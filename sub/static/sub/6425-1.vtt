43:26.895 --> 43:29.564
lt's my deployment schedule...

...and if you can look where it says
"tomorrow's events."

- Yeah, go ahead, read aloud.
- "Nine a.m. press conference...

43:38.365 --> 43:39.699

- Mm-hm.

Speak up, we cannot hear you!

at the Venetian"...

of channels two, four...

that Tom Abernathy is a suspect.

43:54.048 --> 43:56.215
Why are you doing this to me?

43:56.383 --> 43:58.259
GRACIE:
Because l wanna find my friends.

43:58.594 --> 44:01.721
And because you are sweating
in all three stress spots...

44:01.889 --> 44:06.851
...that people routinely start sweating in
before they undergo public humiliation.

44:07.353 --> 44:09.145

44:10.230 --> 44:12.690
Okay, everybody,
l would love to stay and chat...

44:12.858 --> 44:15.902
...but l have to go pick out my outfit
for the press conference.

Hey! Hey! Hold up! Hold up. Wait.

44:30.167 --> 44:35.046
Okay. Somebody came up to me
the day before.

44:35.214 --> 44:39.550
She offers me 200 bucks if l will park
far away from the entrance at the home...

44:39.718 --> 44:43.971

You didn't do what was on the schedule,
and l'm a schedule-type person.

- Oh.
- You missed the press conference.

45:10.374 --> 45:13.418

l got a tip from the limo driver...

...who said somebody
who looked like Dolly Parton...

in front of the senior home.

- Yeah.

without clearing it with me?

Okay? You work for me, so...

for this, okay?

get something...

45:45.159 --> 45:47.910
Okay, look.
l am the face of the Bureau.

You are here to help me be
the face of the Bureau...

...which means you work for me.
It's no big...

Look, Hart, l am your bodyguard.
That means l need a body to guard!

46:02.050 --> 46:06.596

l could bring you up on charges.

right now.

if you don't listen to me" team.

If you remember correctly,
it was "skinny ass."

And, second of all,
what is your problem, Fuller?

46:27.034 --> 46:28.618
Do you honestly feel it's okay...

46:28.786 --> 46:31.662
...to go around harassing people
and bashing their faces in?

46:31.830 --> 46:34.415
Guess what.
You will never make it in this Bureau...

46:34.583 --> 46:37.627

You just use...

Fuller, violence is not the answer
to our problems, all right? lt's not.

because l'm "scared" of you. Okay?

55:10.640 --> 55:12.891
You guys are lucky
Janet had to work late...

55:13.059 --> 55:16.687
...because if she was here,
she would not put up with any of this.

55:17.355 --> 55:20.649
Now, Janet... Janet runs a tight ship.

You as a dainty-travel-pillow type.

55:49.929 --> 55:52.514
- It's hypoallergenic.
- Oh, really?

55:52.682 --> 55:55.934
- And what are you allergic to?
- Besides you?

55:56.102 --> 56:01.190
Shellfish, cats, dogs,
any type of animal dander...

56:01.358 --> 56:02.941
...dairy products, dust...

56:03.109 --> 56:06.570
- You should be in a plastic bubble.
- Plastic.

56:07.280 --> 56:10.699
- That explains it.
- Explains what?

56:10.867 --> 56:13.744

or a cat or ice cream or dust.

It wasn't bad.

- I got to hang out with my dad a lot.

56:35.183 --> 56:40.771
He was a sportswriter, so we got to
watch all the games on TV together...

56:40.939 --> 56:43.273
...and he taught me how to box.

56:43.650 --> 56:46.235
Taught me how to take care of myself.

56:50.156 --> 56:53.992
Well, l'm sure he was very proud of you.

56:58.873 --> 57:04.378
Uh... Yeah, l read on your file that
he died before you became an agent.

57:04.546 --> 57:08.465
- You read my file?
- I had to make sure you weren't crazy.

57:08.925 --> 57:13.887
- Yeah. Turns out you can't trust a file.
- Yeah, well, l guess you can't.

57:14.055 --> 57:18.475
l thought l would've liked a tomboy
from Jersey whose mom was an agent.

57:18.810 --> 57:21.645
- You read my file?
- Worse.

57:21.813 --> 57:23.105
Your book.

57:24.524 --> 57:26.608
Had to make sure you weren't crazy.

57:26.776 --> 57:30.195
Turns out you can't trust a book.

57:33.867 --> 57:36.285
Yeah, they brought in this writer...

57:36.744 --> 57:40.831
...who managed to turn the entire story
into some fairy tale.

57:40.999 --> 57:43.876
In the first draft, he made it sound like
my mother died...

57:44.043 --> 57:48.422
...single-handedly saving the country,
when all it was was just, you know, a...

57:48.590 --> 57:51.592
It was just a drug bust gone bad.

Sorry about your dad.

58:04.397 --> 58:07.357

you had to read that book.

58:08.401 --> 58:10.819

58:11.404 --> 58:13.197
Oh, really?

What was his name?

58:17.702 --> 58:19.369
Which one?

The agent, the one
that was in the pageant with you.
