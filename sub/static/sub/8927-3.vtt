WEBVTT

00:11.376 --> 00:13.461
There is no life here.
There is no joy here.

00:13.462 --> 00:15.913
- There is no love here.
- What are you talking about?!

00:15.914 --> 00:17.832
What do you think
I'm out there fighting for

00:17.833 --> 00:20.751
if not to make all
those things possible here?

00:20.752 --> 00:23.137
The fort controls the bay,
I control the fort.

00:23.138 --> 00:24.889
So I will be your partner.

00:27.426 --> 00:29.477
I'm afraid I'm simply enjoying myself

00:29.478 --> 00:31.896
way too much to consider
leaving this place.

00:31.897 --> 00:34.482
I know his crew hold an asset
from their last prize

00:34.483 --> 00:35.900
that they deem of great value.

00:35.901 --> 00:37.602
- What asset?
- I don't know.

00:37.603 --> 00:39.487
We'll procure a ship,
we'll recruit men

00:39.488 --> 00:41.939
and we'll create
from nothing a new crew.

00:41.940 --> 00:43.991
You asked for better captains,

00:43.992 --> 00:46.027
I give you Captain Jack Rackham.

00:46.028 --> 00:49.247
In less than two days, I
intend to be a captain again.

00:49.248 --> 00:51.365
Fire!

00:51.366 --> 00:55.419
You orchestrated it all.
The deaths, the destruction.

00:55.420 --> 00:58.004
Is it possible a man
could do such a thing?

02:34.253 --> 02:37.121
Herein lies the problem we face

02:37.122 --> 02:39.657
if we are to secure Nassau's future.

02:39.658 --> 02:44.429
It is a problem that has festered
for more than a generation.

02:44.430 --> 02:47.230
And it's a problem most insidious.

02:48.567 --> 02:50.768
Illiteracy?

02:50.769 --> 02:52.437
Her husband.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.355
Governor Robert Thompson,

02:54.356 --> 02:56.824
the one accepting bribes
from pirate captains

02:56.825 --> 03:00.528
as fast as they can pay them in exchange
for catering to their every need.

03:00.529 --> 03:04.248
Meanwhile, he's sending word back to
his pamphleteer friends in London

03:04.249 --> 03:06.751
about the scourge
of the pirate menace,

03:06.752 --> 03:09.287
which garners him
sympathy and support,

03:09.288 --> 03:10.705
which solidifies his position,

03:10.706 --> 03:12.590
and which only fuels
the underlying problem.

03:12.591 --> 03:15.176
That's true, but I don't see how
we can do anything about it.

03:15.177 --> 03:18.262
We can't get an honest man
appointed governor in the Bahamas?

03:18.263 --> 03:20.131
We can get him appointed.
The problem seems to be

03:20.132 --> 03:21.516
keeping him honest thereafter.

03:21.517 --> 03:23.217
Well, what stands in the way of it?

03:23.218 --> 03:24.802
Well, the Atlantic Ocean.

03:24.803 --> 03:26.771
Put a man on an island,

03:26.772 --> 03:28.056
give him power over other men,

03:28.057 --> 03:29.640
and it won't be long before he realizes

03:29.641 --> 03:31.642
that the limits of that power
are nowhere to be seen.

03:31.643 --> 03:35.146
And no man given that kind of influence
will remain honest for very long.

03:35.147 --> 03:37.064
Yes?

03:38.317 --> 03:40.151
Came to make sure
you two were still alive.

03:40.152 --> 03:42.787
No one's heard from you in hours.

03:42.788 --> 03:45.373
The lieutenant was
just recounting to me

03:45.374 --> 03:49.077
his belief that the only thing that
stands between us and a prosperous Nassau

03:49.078 --> 03:53.381
is an ocean, 100 years of
history, and human nature.

03:53.382 --> 03:55.550
Has he been like this all day?

03:55.551 --> 03:57.051
More or less, ma'am, yes.

04:02.641 --> 04:05.560
A gift. One of my favorites.

04:05.561 --> 04:07.845
And you might find it helpful

04:07.846 --> 04:10.481
in dealing with
my husband going forward.

04:10.482 --> 04:11.933
Thank you, dear. Well played.

04:11.934 --> 04:14.352
Although that edition is in Spanish.

04:14.353 --> 04:16.019
I don't think
the lieutenant speaks it.

04:16.021 --> 04:17.772
Perhaps he should learn.

04:17.773 --> 04:21.690
In his profession, you never
know when it might be useful.

04:39.178 --> 04:41.679
Stop jacking off on the figurehead.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.547
Joji!

04:46.468 --> 04:49.220
Last item.

04:49.221 --> 04:52.190
The powers that be have chosen
a spot for our anchorage.

04:52.191 --> 04:55.526
One mile north-northeast of
the western tip of the Hog

04:55.527 --> 04:57.612
well beyond the view of Nassau town.

04:57.613 --> 04:59.897
Watches will continue on schedule

04:59.898 --> 05:02.066
while provisions
are secured via longboat.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.867
Well, why ain't there been a vote?

05:05.120 --> 05:06.404
I beg your pardon?

05:06.405 --> 05:08.623
Well, I want to go home.
Back in the bay.

05:08.624 --> 05:10.958
Ain't no one ask
what I think about it.

05:10.959 --> 05:14.212
We vote that fuck of a captain
back into his station

05:14.213 --> 05:16.913
and he's already skirting
the fucking rules.

05:19.301 --> 05:21.418
We're sailing a Spanish warship.

05:23.138 --> 05:26.923
Captain Hornigold's fort protects
the bay from Spanish warships.

05:29.761 --> 05:32.230
I imagine the captain
and quartermaster

05:32.231 --> 05:35.566
thought it self-evident that
someone must go ahead and explain

05:35.567 --> 05:37.768
so as to avoid a reactionary
attack from the fort.

05:37.769 --> 05:41.104
We're flying the black.
Doesn't it identify us?

05:43.275 --> 05:46.444
You mean behind the giant
red crosses on the sails?

05:50.249 --> 05:52.950
I want to vote.

05:54.670 --> 05:57.454
Hey, don't worry. We'll sort it out.

05:58.957 --> 06:00.541
Land ho!

06:56.481 --> 06:58.733
Almost took my fucking head off.

07:18.203 --> 07:20.254
I've made camp at Port Royal,

07:20.255 --> 07:22.373
Tortuga, Kingston.

07:22.374 --> 07:25.542
No matter where I've been,
one thing is true.

07:26.878 --> 07:28.879
There's always one.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.765
The one you don't cross.

07:30.766 --> 07:33.100
It would seem readily
apparent that in this place,

07:33.101 --> 07:35.219
that would be you.

07:35.220 --> 07:37.387
Thank you for noticing.

07:39.107 --> 07:41.192
What the fuck are you doing here?

07:41.193 --> 07:44.145
I think it's no secret
that since my arrival

07:44.146 --> 07:46.647
I've been repeatedly provoked and
harassed by the Guthrie woman.

07:46.648 --> 07:50.034
And, as her aggression
seems to be escalating,

07:50.035 --> 07:52.370
I thought it wise to speak
of this in the open.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.288
Her aggression towards you?

07:54.289 --> 07:57.491
Conspiracy with my
quartermaster to depose me.

07:57.492 --> 08:00.211
And a provocation by her man-at-arms.

08:00.212 --> 08:01.692
I think you and I
have both seen enough

08:01.693 --> 08:03.414
of these things to know
they never end well.

08:03.415 --> 08:04.799
What are you telling me for?

08:04.800 --> 08:08.719
I saw you that day in the tavern.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.723
I hear you and she have a connection.

08:12.724 --> 08:16.010
And if things were to deteriorate
even further between us,

08:16.011 --> 08:19.730
I'd just like to know whether
I'll have you to deal with, too.

08:19.731 --> 08:23.067
I can't imagine what we'd have
to gain by taking an interest

08:23.068 --> 08:25.936
in the affairs of the Guthrie woman.

08:25.937 --> 08:27.937
Would you, Captain?

08:30.826 --> 08:33.159
- Not that I can see.
- You certain?

08:33.160 --> 08:35.946
I only ask again
in that I know myself,

08:35.947 --> 08:38.783
and I know when confronting
threats like these,

08:38.784 --> 08:40.583
I tend to be a bit
of a blunt instrument.

08:40.585 --> 08:42.787
Try as I may to be rational,

08:42.788 --> 08:44.455
there's an instinct
towards the extreme

08:44.456 --> 08:46.290
that always gets the better of me.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.376
So that we're clear,

08:48.377 --> 08:51.762
no matter how bloody this
feud gets between she and I,

08:51.763 --> 08:55.515
I can rest soundly knowing
you'll take no part in it?

08:57.019 --> 08:59.552
None whatsoever.

09:01.523 --> 09:03.307
However...

09:03.308 --> 09:05.643
commerce here relies upon her.

09:05.644 --> 09:07.945
Should you move against her,

09:07.946 --> 09:11.282
you may find no shortage of
new enemies on the street.

09:11.283 --> 09:13.199
Perhaps.

09:14.653 --> 09:17.988
Although, from what I understand,

09:17.989 --> 09:20.374
confidence in her new venture

09:20.375 --> 09:23.461
is tepid at best.

09:23.462 --> 09:26.713
Who knows how much she'll
be missed if at all?

09:35.090 --> 09:36.223
What's that?

09:36.224 --> 09:38.008
Tribute.

09:38.009 --> 09:40.261
And the respect of my crew.

09:40.262 --> 09:43.096
10% of our most recent haul.

09:44.683 --> 09:46.650
Would have been a little heavier,

09:46.651 --> 09:49.853
only she taxed us over the
state of the containers.

10:34.892 --> 10:36.359
Are they still in there?

10:36.360 --> 10:38.894
Far as I know. Door hasn't
opened all morning.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.031
When she finally emerges,
tell her I've left.

11:42.042 --> 11:44.127
I'll make contact
with Captain Hornigold,

11:44.128 --> 11:47.130
inform him of our arrival, and
arrange safe passage into harbor.

11:47.131 --> 11:49.632
I'll then attempt to persuade him

11:49.633 --> 11:51.968
to assign the bulk
of his crew and his ship

11:51.969 --> 11:53.519
to sail in consort with us.

11:55.105 --> 11:57.774
With a little luck,
we'll be on our way back

11:57.775 --> 12:01.311
to the Urca wreck
within a matter of days.

12:01.312 --> 12:04.147
And how do you plan
to answer the question?

12:04.148 --> 12:05.782
What question is that?

12:05.783 --> 12:09.869
Why is this request coming
from you, Captain Flint,

12:09.870 --> 12:11.870
and not from Mr. Gates?

12:14.742 --> 12:19.211
When in doubt, the truth
is a good place to start.

12:20.331 --> 12:22.632
Oh, matter of ship business.

12:22.633 --> 12:25.668
I've noticed the berths for the
vanguard are less than ideal.

12:25.669 --> 12:27.303
I'd like to have them set in here.

12:27.304 --> 12:28.888
Give the men a little
more space to breathe.

12:28.889 --> 12:32.308
You want the vanguard to quarter
in the captain's cabin?

12:32.309 --> 12:34.344
I'm not a tyrant, Mr. Dufresne.

12:34.345 --> 12:36.262
The ship belongs to all of us.

12:36.263 --> 12:38.815
This seems a way to ensure that
we all benefit from it equally.

12:38.816 --> 12:41.734
It also seems a way to
ensure that the next time

12:41.735 --> 12:43.936
someone raises a pistol towards you,

12:43.937 --> 12:46.822
well, the vanguard
has a rooting interest.

12:48.275 --> 12:50.326
After my departure,
please ensure that mine

12:50.327 --> 12:52.912
is the only longboat that ferries
anyone to and from the island.

12:52.913 --> 12:55.782
- The men will resist.
- Then you resist them right back.

12:55.783 --> 12:58.334
They all know that we're headed
back for the Urca's gold.

12:58.335 --> 12:59.669
They all know where it is.

12:59.670 --> 13:02.455
They all know that its
defenses are weakened.

13:02.456 --> 13:05.874
We simply cannot allow that information
leaking out onto the beach.

13:07.378 --> 13:09.295
Or let them go if you like.

13:09.296 --> 13:11.214
To whatever extent
you're comfortable competing

13:11.215 --> 13:13.800
with a dozen other crews
to retrieve that gold.

13:13.801 --> 13:17.887
Mr. Silver should be back aboard
with provisions within a few hours.

13:17.888 --> 13:20.055
That ought to keep tempers in check.

13:27.281 --> 13:28.815
Are these the ones?

13:28.816 --> 13:30.565
Handpicked.

13:31.902 --> 13:33.820
You understand what
I'm asking you to do?

13:33.821 --> 13:35.071
Go back and watch the gold.

13:35.072 --> 13:36.906
Keep watch on the Spanish soldiers

13:36.907 --> 13:38.458
who are watching the gold.

13:38.459 --> 13:41.711
You'll depart as soon as a
longboat can be made ready.

13:41.712 --> 13:44.630
Return to Division Bay.
Approach from the south.

13:44.631 --> 13:46.132
Stay inland and out of sight.

13:46.133 --> 13:48.418
Keep constant watch on that
beach until we arrive.

13:48.419 --> 13:51.170
I should be no more
than two days behind you.

13:51.171 --> 13:52.755
At which point I'll need
to know everything

13:52.756 --> 13:55.641
about their routines,
schedule, watch strength.

13:55.642 --> 13:59.011
Then we'll reconnoiter,
plan our final assault,

13:59.012 --> 14:01.397
secure the gold. Is that clear?

14:01.398 --> 14:03.098
Go.

14:04.852 --> 14:07.403
You certain they're the men for this?

14:07.404 --> 14:10.072
They're the only ones who didn't
ask for more than I offered.

14:10.073 --> 14:11.574
So they had that in their favor.

14:11.575 --> 14:13.443
Jesus.

14:13.444 --> 14:17.196
I thought we needed to get back to
the ship as quickly as possible.

14:17.197 --> 14:19.499
You're bringing something to read?

14:19.500 --> 14:21.950
It isn't for me.

14:55.619 --> 14:57.370
Strange.

14:57.371 --> 14:59.739
You and I have never shared
more than a few words,

14:59.740 --> 15:02.959
and yet I feel like we're old friends.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.494
Do you?

15:04.495 --> 15:06.245
Of course.

15:06.246 --> 15:08.663
James talks about you all the time.

15:11.668 --> 15:13.418
Captain Flint.

15:15.055 --> 15:17.306
He's told me what you've
accomplished in this place.

15:17.307 --> 15:20.175
With those men. In spite of them.

15:22.262 --> 15:24.931
It's no small feat.

15:24.932 --> 15:26.682
And I admire it.

15:26.683 --> 15:29.268
Do you know what
he told me about you?

15:29.269 --> 15:30.519
What's that?

15:32.856 --> 15:34.857
Nothing.

15:34.858 --> 15:37.610
When I ask him, all I get
is a shrug or a laugh

15:37.611 --> 15:41.364
or an innocent suggestion that
he has a longtime companion.

15:41.365 --> 15:43.699
Her name is Barlow
and nothing more.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.618
Is that possible?

15:45.619 --> 15:47.587
Is it possible that
you're so unremarkable

15:47.588 --> 15:49.704
as to resist any further
description than that?

15:51.041 --> 15:53.175
Certainly possible.

15:53.176 --> 15:56.128
You conspire with my father
to sabotage our plans.

15:56.129 --> 15:57.964
You betray our trust.

15:57.965 --> 16:00.349
You cause almost irreparable
damage as a result.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.718
And when Flint, the most feared
captain in all creation,

16:02.719 --> 16:04.804
comes to confront you about it,

16:04.805 --> 16:06.721
you destroy him.

16:08.392 --> 16:10.560
Now I hear in the wind
that in his absence

16:10.561 --> 16:14.230
you've begun to forge new
alliances with his enemies.

16:14.231 --> 16:16.282
With the farmers of the interior.

16:16.283 --> 16:18.868
With Mr. Underhill,
the man sheltering

16:18.869 --> 16:20.569
my shit of a father as we speak.

16:23.073 --> 16:25.908
It's true I've joined Pastor
Lambrick's congregation

16:25.909 --> 16:28.244
and that Mr. Underhill is a member.

16:28.245 --> 16:31.830
Yet here you sit, brewing tea
as if none of it ever happened.

16:33.216 --> 16:35.051
And I'm forced to wonder
exactly what it is

16:35.052 --> 16:37.752
you hold over Flint that makes
everything I've seen possible.

16:39.139 --> 16:41.223
You don't know what you've seen.

16:41.224 --> 16:43.092
You didn't betray him?

16:43.093 --> 16:45.561
I don't believe I did, no.

16:45.562 --> 16:48.097
And if he's being honest,
neither does he.

16:48.098 --> 16:50.266
I'm sorry.
I saw the look on his face

16:50.267 --> 16:52.387
the last night he left this
place and I beg to differ.

16:55.522 --> 16:58.691
Every man has his torments.

16:58.692 --> 17:01.110
Demons born of past wrongs

17:01.111 --> 17:03.279
that hound and harass him.

17:03.280 --> 17:06.616
You perceive the effects
of Captain Flint's demons.

17:06.617 --> 17:08.951
Echoes of their voices.

17:08.952 --> 17:11.287
But I know their names.

17:11.288 --> 17:13.955
I was there when they were born.

17:13.957 --> 17:15.958
I know the things

17:15.959 --> 17:18.294
they whisper to him at night.

17:18.295 --> 17:21.097
So you can believe me when I tell you

17:21.098 --> 17:24.766
that within his chorus of torments...

17:26.435 --> 17:29.020
none of them look or sound like me.

17:31.642 --> 17:33.893
I don't know what it is
that you owe Flint

17:33.894 --> 17:35.895
or that he owes you.

17:35.896 --> 17:37.480
But after the damage you've caused,

17:37.481 --> 17:40.399
I know what you owe me and
I've come here to collect.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.618
I need to speak with Underhill.

17:42.619 --> 17:45.871
As a result of your actions, my
business interests are now vulnerable.

17:45.872 --> 17:49.325
Acquiring the partnership of a
plantation the size of Mr. Underhill's

17:49.326 --> 17:51.410
could help bolster commerce
on my side of the island.

17:51.411 --> 17:54.547
My attempts to reach him by
letter have gone unanswered.

17:54.548 --> 17:56.549
And considering your new friendship,

17:56.550 --> 17:58.834
I would like for you
to help arrange a meeting.

17:58.835 --> 18:01.170
I thought he was an enemy of yours.

18:01.171 --> 18:04.256
Perhaps I'm willing to see
things in a different light.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.424
Will you do it?

18:08.395 --> 18:10.178
I'll try.

18:26.530 --> 18:28.581
This isn't enough.

18:28.582 --> 18:30.282
It's all there are funds for.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.834
Then less flour and more rum.

18:31.835 --> 18:33.703
Mr. Dufresne was right.

18:33.704 --> 18:36.505
The men will expect some time
in town before we depart.

18:36.506 --> 18:40.126
I want them as contented as possible
when I inform them otherwise.

18:40.127 --> 18:42.962
The Spanish soldiers
guarding the Hulk

18:42.963 --> 18:46.048
are four days removed by
longboat from St. Augustine.

18:46.049 --> 18:47.466
By my reckoning, we got a week,

18:47.467 --> 18:50.302
two at the most, before
King Philip takes his gold back.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.353
There's no time for delay.

18:53.724 --> 18:56.776
Get those supplies as quickly as
you can and meet me back here.

18:56.777 --> 18:58.778
I'll engage Captain Hornigold

18:58.779 --> 19:01.062
and make way for the ship
to enter the bay.

19:02.899 --> 19:05.284
At least you won't have a
hard time finding him.

19:05.285 --> 19:07.652
Isn't that Hornigold's flag?

19:13.160 --> 19:15.710
Why isn't he in his fort?

19:24.888 --> 19:27.088
What the fuck happened here?

20:05.962 --> 20:08.798
I hear this is once again a place

20:08.799 --> 20:10.599
where men come with coins
in their pockets

20:10.600 --> 20:12.968
and secrets in their heads

20:12.969 --> 20:14.970
and leave with less of both.

20:14.971 --> 20:17.272
And I hear you're the one
doing the collecting.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.644
You can relax.

20:21.645 --> 20:23.479
I'm not here to stop it.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.480
Your place, do as you like.

20:27.534 --> 20:30.452
But there is a secret you
wish my help in obtaining?

20:30.453 --> 20:32.571
New crew on the island,

20:32.572 --> 20:34.456
captained by a man named Low.

20:34.457 --> 20:37.576
They're hiding something.
A piece from their last prize.

20:37.577 --> 20:40.629
Something unique.
Something of great value.

20:40.630 --> 20:44.083
Seeing as his crew makes
frequent use of your girls,

20:44.084 --> 20:46.968
I'd like you to find out what it is.

20:51.258 --> 20:53.926
The other day I had
a moment with Eleanor.

20:53.927 --> 20:58.013
Told her all the things I wanted
to say to her for so long.

20:58.014 --> 21:00.649
That I was unbroken by her.

21:00.650 --> 21:03.686
And I saw that it shook her.

21:03.687 --> 21:06.155
And I felt happy.

21:06.156 --> 21:09.858
And the moment she turned to walk away
from me, do you know what I felt?

21:11.995 --> 21:14.914
The urge to go after her
and hold her again.

21:14.915 --> 21:18.334
It's amazing, isn't it,
the spell she casts on us.

21:18.335 --> 21:20.035
What are you talking about?

21:20.036 --> 21:21.587
You're right.

21:21.588 --> 21:24.540
Captain Low's men
are familiar faces here.

21:24.541 --> 21:27.376
Just today I heard all the
captain was talking about

21:27.377 --> 21:30.295
were the awful things he'd like
to visit upon Eleanor Guthrie.

21:31.715 --> 21:33.883
Given the timing of your request,

21:33.884 --> 21:36.384
I assume you've heard the same thing.

21:38.722 --> 21:42.024
Jack and Anne have no idea what
they're up against with you, do they?

21:42.025 --> 21:43.726
The only question that remains

21:43.727 --> 21:47.980
is what difference does it
make what his cargo is worth?

21:47.981 --> 21:50.900
Though I suppose if the
value is great enough,

21:50.901 --> 21:53.786
it would give you pretense to move
against him and call it business

21:53.787 --> 21:56.537
instead of calling it
what it actually is.

21:58.825 --> 22:02.043
I'm going to assume
we have an agreement.

22:08.084 --> 22:10.585
It's not enough.

22:11.588 --> 22:13.756
The money is generous,

22:13.757 --> 22:16.342
but I'd rather have
something else from you.

22:16.343 --> 22:18.344
Such as?

22:18.345 --> 22:20.763
Your former shipmates,

22:20.764 --> 22:24.016
they wish to sail again
under their own banner.

22:24.017 --> 22:27.269
But so long as they bear the
black mark you put upon them,

22:27.270 --> 22:29.070
their prospects will remain dim.

22:30.774 --> 22:32.607
I'd like you to remove it.

22:46.206 --> 22:48.624
I found a way
to stop caring about her.

22:48.625 --> 22:50.676
Would you like to know how?

22:50.677 --> 22:52.377
No.

22:53.964 --> 22:55.922
You understand
the job I'm looking to fill?

22:55.923 --> 22:57.300
Yes, ma'am.

22:57.301 --> 22:59.435
And you understand what happened
to the last man who held that job?

22:59.436 --> 23:01.971
- Yes, ma'am.
- What happened to him?

23:06.192 --> 23:08.810
He said the captain
put a sword in his mouth.

23:10.196 --> 23:12.281
You should know that captain
is still a threat to me.

23:12.282 --> 23:14.616
You're not concerned about
stepping into the way of that?

23:14.617 --> 23:16.151
No, ma'am.

23:16.152 --> 23:17.736
I know him, ma'am.

23:17.737 --> 23:20.321
I knew his sister before
they put us on the ship.

23:21.708 --> 23:25.210
You asked me to bring one
I would trust with my life.

23:25.211 --> 23:27.128
This is him.

23:53.323 --> 23:55.356
I didn't get it.

24:07.420 --> 24:10.205
I led myself to believe that I
would either never see you again

24:10.206 --> 24:13.042
or that all our problems
would be solved.

24:13.043 --> 24:16.210
I never made space in my mind
for something in between.

24:17.764 --> 24:21.133
But I'm so very glad you're alive.

24:21.134 --> 24:22.718
You were missed.

24:22.719 --> 24:24.803
What do we do now?

24:24.804 --> 24:26.555
Now?

24:26.556 --> 24:29.058
Bloody go back and retrieve the gold.

24:29.059 --> 24:31.560
Refit, hire a consort, finish the job.

24:31.561 --> 24:33.195
Is that possible?

24:33.196 --> 24:35.697
Well, it might have been possible

24:35.698 --> 24:38.150
when I had someplace to
bring it all back home to.

24:38.151 --> 24:40.819
Before the bay fell
into the hands of a madman.

24:40.820 --> 24:42.788
Fucking Hornigold.

24:42.789 --> 24:45.207
He told me Vane killed 30 of his men.

24:45.208 --> 24:46.875
That he was prepared
to take back the fort,

24:46.876 --> 24:48.827
but that you sabotaged his efforts.

24:48.828 --> 24:50.329
I told him he must be mistaken.

24:50.330 --> 24:52.714
Eleanor Guthrie would never
be so wantonly reckless

24:52.715 --> 24:54.166
with the security of this place.

24:54.167 --> 24:55.834
- I understand your concern, but...
- Do you?

24:55.835 --> 24:58.804
Because what I find most
troubling about all of this

24:58.805 --> 25:01.557
is the sense that you don't share it.

25:01.558 --> 25:03.675
He came through the interior.

25:03.676 --> 25:05.644
There was no warning.

25:05.645 --> 25:08.730
Before I or Hornigold or
anyone knew what was going on,

25:08.731 --> 25:11.066
he and his men were firmly
positioned up there

25:11.067 --> 25:12.518
and threatening to sink
every ship in the bay

25:12.519 --> 25:14.019
the moment we made
any move against him.

25:14.020 --> 25:16.405
- So you did nothing?
- What would you have had me do?

25:16.406 --> 25:18.440
Something! Anything!

25:18.441 --> 25:21.076
Surprise him at night.
Use the tunnels.

25:21.077 --> 25:22.411
He'd have sunk every ship in the bay.

25:22.412 --> 25:23.779
He'd have sunk a few ships in the bay

25:23.780 --> 25:25.531
and it would have been
a price worth paying.

25:25.532 --> 25:29.501
You weren't here. And he isn't
the problem you think he is.

25:29.502 --> 25:32.621
He has no interest in
disrupting the flow of trade.

25:32.622 --> 25:35.624
You look me in the eye and
tell me that you're certain

25:35.625 --> 25:37.843
that if I brought the Urca gold
back here past those guns,

25:37.844 --> 25:41.879
he wouldn't use his position to
rob me of every last ounce of it.

25:45.768 --> 25:47.603
I had to make a quick judgment.

25:47.604 --> 25:50.272
And in the moment it was clear that
the sacrifice it would have taken

25:50.273 --> 25:52.807
to get him out of that fort
was simply too great.

26:07.991 --> 26:11.293
A Spanish warship fell upon us

26:11.294 --> 26:13.995
before we'd found our way to the Urca.

26:17.050 --> 26:21.552
At that point, Mr. Gates'
faith in our mission...

26:24.174 --> 26:27.558
his faith in me was lost.

26:29.012 --> 26:31.480
I had to use my judgment

26:31.481 --> 26:34.791
whether to let him abort
our entire endeavor

26:34.792 --> 26:37.819
and see my plans,
your plans, evaporate

26:37.820 --> 26:41.439
or to stop him.

26:42.742 --> 26:45.159
I stopped him.

26:47.197 --> 26:48.779
What did you do?

26:50.200 --> 26:53.001
What was necessary.

26:53.002 --> 26:56.838
Because I knew that the future
of this place is everything.

26:56.839 --> 26:59.541
And that there is no sacrifice

26:59.542 --> 27:02.377
too great to secure that future.

27:02.378 --> 27:05.763
I thought you and I were
in agreement about that.

27:13.389 --> 27:15.224
I'm sorry you were put to that choice.

27:15.225 --> 27:18.143
I know what he meant to you.

27:18.144 --> 27:21.613
So we are in agreement, then?

27:21.614 --> 27:24.232
He must be removed from that fort.

27:28.788 --> 27:30.656
You've been through hell.

27:30.657 --> 27:34.159
There's nothing about any of this
that can't wait till tomorrow.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.962
Get some rest and we can discuss
this further in the morning.

27:48.258 --> 27:49.590
I saw her today.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.679
Mrs. Barlow.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.597
She seemed concerned for your welfare.

27:58.434 --> 28:00.769
I know you and her

28:00.770 --> 28:02.654
didn't part on pleasant terms.

28:02.655 --> 28:05.015
And perhaps
if you went to see her today...

28:08.611 --> 28:09.995
Lady Hamilton.

28:09.996 --> 28:12.830
I asked the carriage
driver for your address.

28:16.286 --> 28:18.336
Lieutenant, it's rather cold out here.

28:19.789 --> 28:22.039
I beg your pardon. Please, come in.

28:29.632 --> 28:32.683
It's... tidy.

28:37.974 --> 28:40.892
Lady Hamilton, it's very generous
of you to come visit me,

28:40.893 --> 28:43.645
but perhaps I could now escort
you back to your carriage.

28:43.646 --> 28:47.315
Are you familiar with Jonathan
and Margaret Grey, Lieutenant?

28:48.484 --> 28:50.319
The Duke and Duchess of Surrey?

28:50.320 --> 28:52.788
As you may or may not be aware,

28:52.789 --> 28:54.373
they hold one of
the largest collections

28:54.374 --> 28:56.658
of Egyptian artifacts
in all of Europe.

28:56.659 --> 29:00.495
I thought perhaps today you'd join
me in viewing them as my guest.

29:00.496 --> 29:03.415
You mean yours and your husband's?

29:03.416 --> 29:05.167
Thomas is otherwise engaged.

29:05.168 --> 29:07.668
It would just be you and I.

29:09.555 --> 29:11.223
I don't think that's a very good idea.

29:11.224 --> 29:14.775
Why wouldn't it be a good idea?
Would you not enjoy my company?

29:17.680 --> 29:20.482
That would seem
to be beside the point.

29:20.483 --> 29:22.150
- The point is...
- How it would look.

29:22.151 --> 29:24.186
Yes, ma'am. Exactly.

29:24.187 --> 29:27.105
Are you happy, Lieutenant?

29:27.106 --> 29:30.192
Happy? In what regard?

29:30.193 --> 29:33.445
In my experience, there is
an inverse relationship

29:33.446 --> 29:35.447
between the degree
of one's happiness

29:35.448 --> 29:37.949
and the concern one suffers
for what the neighbors think.

29:37.950 --> 29:40.168
This isn't an abstraction, ma'am.

29:40.169 --> 29:43.538
- Were your husband to hear...
- I love my husband.

29:43.539 --> 29:45.874
I know what's said
about me behind my back.

29:45.875 --> 29:49.127
Whispers of infidelities.
My husband's heard them.

29:49.128 --> 29:51.129
And I suspect, given
the look on your face,

29:51.130 --> 29:53.715
you've heard them, too.

29:53.716 --> 29:56.884
Thomas and I are not
bothered by them.

29:59.055 --> 30:01.138
The only question that remains is...

30:03.860 --> 30:05.276
are you?

30:12.819 --> 30:15.404
It doesn't concern you?

30:15.405 --> 30:16.571
Pardon?

30:16.572 --> 30:19.241
When you set sail,
my friend had his ear

30:19.242 --> 30:21.743
and you were ballast.

30:21.744 --> 30:24.913
Then he calls my friend a
mutineer and puts him in the sea.

30:24.914 --> 30:27.466
Now he's giving you his ear.

30:27.467 --> 30:31.303
How can you stand so close to him
knowing what he's capable of

30:31.304 --> 30:34.054
and that sooner
or later you'll be next?

30:37.593 --> 30:39.678
Five million pieces of eight.

30:39.679 --> 30:43.147
Why? How do you do it?

30:47.270 --> 30:49.271
You were right.

30:49.272 --> 30:51.323
I don't know where her loyalties lie.

30:51.324 --> 30:53.275
Told you as much.

30:53.276 --> 30:55.243
Either we act now to
remove him or no one will.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.279
We don't have time for this.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.916
Every day wasted dealing with this
is a day closer to losing that gold.

31:00.917 --> 31:03.000
Then I suggest we act quickly.

31:11.594 --> 31:15.881
...and as many prizes
as I can capture.

31:15.882 --> 31:18.767
And as for captain, well,
you're looking at him.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.316
Who were they?

31:34.317 --> 31:36.818
Men wise enough to know
that on this island

31:36.819 --> 31:38.236
three things are known to be true.

31:38.237 --> 31:41.072
Number two is Jack Rackham
is a crew killer.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.908
It'll turn.

31:42.909 --> 31:44.910
I admire your optimism.

31:44.911 --> 31:47.913
- Why didn't you wait for me?
- You were preoccupied.

31:47.914 --> 31:50.665
If you're angry about the whore
and me, just fucking say so.

31:50.666 --> 31:53.335
You have an itch that needs scratching.
Go with God.

31:53.336 --> 31:55.170
My trouble isn't that she
knows how to play the thing

31:55.171 --> 31:58.173
between your legs better than I,
but the one between your ears.

31:58.174 --> 32:00.225
Do you honestly not see it?

32:00.226 --> 32:02.811
That your judgment with
her is clouded at best.

32:02.812 --> 32:04.513
That she knows it
and intends to use it

32:04.514 --> 32:07.265
to drive a wedge between us, because
it is painfully obvious to me.

32:07.266 --> 32:09.985
And there's nothing
I can do to counter it

32:09.986 --> 32:12.603
when I'm on the wrong
side of that door.

32:15.658 --> 32:17.526
Of course I can see it.

32:17.527 --> 32:20.160
Then why don't you stop it?

32:24.784 --> 32:26.750
I can't.

32:39.382 --> 32:41.048
Join me.

32:42.268 --> 32:44.018
Won't you?

32:58.484 --> 33:00.284
Sit down.

33:04.991 --> 33:06.875
What's happening exactly?

33:06.876 --> 33:09.911
I'm repairing your reputations.

33:09.912 --> 33:12.497
Public display of reconciliation.

33:12.498 --> 33:14.833
So just sit there,

33:14.834 --> 33:17.419
smile,

33:17.420 --> 33:18.719
and let it happen.

33:22.975 --> 33:24.391
To Mr. Hamund.

33:26.429 --> 33:28.145
We hardly knew ye.

33:35.605 --> 33:37.238
Look at the two of you.

33:37.239 --> 33:40.275
Every reason to run
screaming from each other.

33:40.276 --> 33:42.777
And yet you're still as thick
as the moment I first found you

33:42.778 --> 33:44.829
fucking behind the galley.

33:44.830 --> 33:46.781
You'll either be
the death of each other

33:46.782 --> 33:49.117
or we'll all end up
working for you someday.

33:49.118 --> 33:51.785
Doubt there's any third outcome.

33:55.424 --> 33:58.292
Why? Why now?

34:08.437 --> 34:10.888
I know what Low's cargo is.

34:18.147 --> 34:20.230
No shit?

34:27.039 --> 34:28.489
Stand up.

35:03.242 --> 35:05.276
Will that do?

35:05.277 --> 35:06.660
I believe so.

35:08.664 --> 35:10.165
Congratulations, Jack.

35:10.166 --> 35:12.833
Now you know what it's like
to rise from the grave.

35:24.304 --> 35:25.847
Well, it's not exactly a feast,

35:25.848 --> 35:28.016
but the food I've procured
should be waiting by the jetty.

35:28.017 --> 35:30.635
Get rid of it. Dump it. Sell it.
I don't care.

35:30.636 --> 35:33.054
- What about the crew?
- Tell them the truth.

35:33.055 --> 35:34.973
It was stolen from them
by Charles Vane

35:34.974 --> 35:37.108
and the horde of barbarians
he now commands.

35:37.109 --> 35:39.527
They've run amok on the island
and no one's been spared.

35:39.528 --> 35:40.945
Didn't you notice?

35:40.946 --> 35:43.448
I want them boiling over
by the time I return.

35:43.449 --> 35:45.733
Where are you going?

35:46.902 --> 35:48.702
I see.

35:55.161 --> 35:56.828
Where are we going?

35:56.829 --> 35:59.547
I'm quite certain this isn't the
way to the Greys' residence.

35:59.548 --> 36:02.666
I quietly instructed the
driver to take you home.

36:05.588 --> 36:07.088
Propriety.

36:07.089 --> 36:09.140
Lady Hamilton, do you know
what would happen in my world

36:09.141 --> 36:12.393
if people just did as they please
with no regard for convention?

36:12.394 --> 36:15.480
Columbus would still be sailing in
circles off the coast of Spain.

36:20.269 --> 36:23.738
I imagine there are two kinds of
men who make their life at sea.

36:23.739 --> 36:26.908
Those whose sense of duty forces them

36:26.909 --> 36:30.829
to leave any sense of permanence
or identity behind them

36:30.830 --> 36:33.447
and those for whom
that is the attraction.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.201
Which do you think I am?

36:36.202 --> 36:39.337
I think you're someone
who's very good

36:39.338 --> 36:41.206
at managing how you're perceived.

36:41.207 --> 36:43.758
And perhaps getting
what you want

36:43.759 --> 36:46.294
without anyone ever
knowing how you did it

36:46.295 --> 36:48.429
or perhaps if it ever happened at all.

36:48.430 --> 36:50.597
Perhaps...

36:56.472 --> 37:00.307
Don't tell me propriety has worked
its evils on you, too, now.

37:02.311 --> 37:04.478
I was going to say...

37:06.115 --> 37:08.566
that perhaps you're more
concerned with whether or not

37:08.567 --> 37:12.486
people talk about what you and I do
may be doing behind closed doors...

37:13.906 --> 37:16.123
than with what we actually are doing.

38:13.132 --> 38:15.049
All right, start again

38:15.050 --> 38:16.550
at the beginning of the measure.

38:54.807 --> 38:56.841
State your name!

38:56.842 --> 38:58.592
What's going on?

39:27.122 --> 39:28.588
May I?

39:41.804 --> 39:44.722
I admire you for coming
to see me earlier.

39:44.723 --> 39:47.308
Showed you were a man
who knows his place.

39:47.309 --> 39:50.028
That quality alone puts you ahead

39:50.029 --> 39:52.195
of practically every other
captain on this island.

39:53.315 --> 39:55.316
So I'd like to make you an offer.

39:55.317 --> 39:57.151
An offer?

39:57.152 --> 40:00.787
Partnership between
your crew and mine.

40:04.543 --> 40:05.877
I'm not interested.

40:05.878 --> 40:07.661
But you haven't heard the deal yet.

40:10.916 --> 40:13.251
I took the fort to control the bay,

40:13.252 --> 40:16.471
but I have no desire
to waste away in it.

40:16.472 --> 40:18.339
My place is at sea.

40:18.340 --> 40:20.224
But as I'm certain you've heard,

40:20.225 --> 40:22.176
I was recently deprived of my ship.

40:22.177 --> 40:24.595
Which means I need a new one.

40:24.596 --> 40:27.231
Were she to come with a
strong crew, all the better.

40:27.232 --> 40:29.484
Let me stop you there.

40:29.485 --> 40:33.604
Before I came to see you this morning,
I will admit I was concerned.

40:33.605 --> 40:37.191
It's painfully clear you've got
feelings for the Guthrie woman.

40:37.192 --> 40:39.994
If you could bring all your
men to bear to protect her,

40:39.995 --> 40:42.030
to retaliate against anyone
who would move against her,

40:42.031 --> 40:45.248
that might be reason enough
to let this whole matter go.

40:46.418 --> 40:48.119
But do you know what I think now?

40:48.120 --> 40:51.039
I think your men couldn't care
less about Eleanor Guthrie.

40:51.040 --> 40:54.542
I think they find your feelings
for her to be pathetic.

40:54.543 --> 40:57.211
I think you're powerless
to do anything about this.

40:57.212 --> 40:59.380
And for all these reasons,
I think my feelings

40:59.381 --> 41:01.716
about Eleanor scare you to death.

41:01.717 --> 41:06.354
And I must say, coming out
here alone like this,

41:06.355 --> 41:09.473
it only serves to confirm my suspicions.

41:11.610 --> 41:13.894
Do your men even know you're here?

41:42.391 --> 41:46.144
I recommend you get up
and get off my ship.

41:46.145 --> 41:49.097
Don't you want to hear
the rest of my terms first?

41:49.098 --> 41:51.682
By all means.

41:51.683 --> 41:54.268
I get your ship.

41:54.269 --> 41:56.019
I get your cargo.

41:57.739 --> 41:59.357
I get your weapons.

42:01.243 --> 42:04.444
I get it all.

42:05.531 --> 42:07.698
And what exactly

42:07.699 --> 42:10.417
would I get in exchange for all that?

42:12.204 --> 42:14.171
A head start.

42:16.542 --> 42:18.508
Mr. Holmes.

42:25.134 --> 42:27.467
Mr. Holmes doesn't work here anymore.

43:56.275 --> 43:58.609
Found the prize they was hiding.

43:58.610 --> 44:01.027
Just where the whore said she'd be.

44:09.238 --> 44:11.239
Tobacco?

44:11.240 --> 44:13.406
Tobacco, sir?

44:15.460 --> 44:17.411
Tobacco?

44:17.412 --> 44:19.412
Sir?

44:22.584 --> 44:24.334
No, thank you.

44:27.673 --> 44:29.256
Mr. Scott.

44:54.116 --> 44:55.916
I apologize.

44:55.917 --> 44:57.418
Didn't imagine your new crewmates

44:57.419 --> 44:59.003
would appreciate you
and I speaking directly.

44:59.004 --> 45:01.956
No, I don't imagine they would.

45:01.957 --> 45:04.508
How have they taken to you?
Any better?

45:04.509 --> 45:07.460
Hmm, small moves.

45:09.965 --> 45:11.432
Flint came to see me today.

45:11.433 --> 45:14.352
- I know he and Hornigold spoke.
- Eleanor.

45:14.353 --> 45:17.638
And I have to believe that he went
to see him after he left my office.

45:17.639 --> 45:19.273
- Were you there when...
- Eleanor.

45:19.274 --> 45:22.193
I would ask you not to
put me in this position.

45:22.194 --> 45:25.446
I swore an oath. I have an obligation
to Captain Hornigold's crew.

45:25.447 --> 45:28.815
You don't have to respond.
Just listen.

45:30.535 --> 45:33.120
I know Flint wants
Vane out of the fort.

45:33.121 --> 45:34.789
I know Hornigold wants it, too.

45:34.790 --> 45:36.457
Ordinarily, it would be bad enough

45:36.458 --> 45:38.542
having them spinning
each other up about it.

45:38.543 --> 45:41.494
But something was different today.

45:42.998 --> 45:45.165
When I saw Flint, something
was different about him.

45:46.918 --> 45:49.219
You know what happened
out there, don't you?

45:51.473 --> 45:53.841
What happened to Mr. Gates.

45:53.842 --> 45:56.677
I've never been under any illusions
of what he's capable of,

45:56.678 --> 45:58.596
- but this is just too...
- Eleanor.

45:58.597 --> 46:00.563
Where are you?

46:01.767 --> 46:03.434
What?

46:03.435 --> 46:04.685
For as long as I can remember,

46:04.686 --> 46:06.654
you have told me how
important Captain Flint is

46:06.655 --> 46:09.690
to the future of this
place, to your future.

46:09.691 --> 46:11.075
You have put money behind him.

46:11.076 --> 46:13.361
You have put your
credibility behind him.

46:13.362 --> 46:15.363
And now you would resist him?

46:15.364 --> 46:17.698
Join with Captain Vane against him?

46:17.699 --> 46:19.417
This isn't about taking sides.

46:19.418 --> 46:20.868
It's about protecting
the fort, protecting Nassau.

46:20.869 --> 46:24.088
Eleanor, you need to ask yourself

46:24.089 --> 46:26.924
what you want,

46:26.925 --> 46:28.958
where your loyalties are...

46:30.095 --> 46:32.045
and whom do you trust?

46:57.426 --> 46:59.889
__

47:30.105 --> 47:31.604
I didn't do it for you.

48:32.384 --> 48:35.219
Six men. Maybe seven.

48:35.220 --> 48:37.972
That should be achievable now.

48:37.973 --> 48:40.341
And with just this week's till,

48:40.342 --> 48:42.560
we can most likely acquire a piragua.

48:44.346 --> 48:46.429
It'll be a small start.

48:48.817 --> 48:50.567
We're gonna sail again.

49:02.080 --> 49:03.696
What the fuck are you waiting for?

49:34.779 --> 49:36.813
Did he see you come up?

50:39.094 --> 50:41.377
What is it?

50:42.714 --> 50:44.631
There's something I need to show you.

51:10.458 --> 51:12.626
That is the crown jewel

51:12.627 --> 51:14.712
taken from the Good Fortune prize.

51:14.713 --> 51:17.498
Her father is Lord Peter Ashe,

51:17.499 --> 51:20.334
governor of the Carolina colony.

51:20.335 --> 51:23.721
Low recorded in his log the ransom
amount he intended to demand.

51:23.722 --> 51:26.506
£250,000.

51:28.093 --> 51:29.309
They sedated her.

51:29.310 --> 51:31.512
Soon as she wakes,
I'll get her particulars

51:31.513 --> 51:32.980
and go ransom her myself.

51:32.981 --> 51:35.182
Lord Ashe won't be trifled with.

51:35.183 --> 51:37.434
I have no intentions
of trifling with him.

51:37.435 --> 51:40.988
He's hanged men for merely
suspecting them of piracy.

51:40.989 --> 51:44.191
He's fanatical about
exterminating men like you.

51:44.192 --> 51:47.111
Eleanor, I wasn't asking permission.

51:47.112 --> 51:49.696
I know what I'm doing.

52:01.876 --> 52:04.044
I told the men what you asked.

52:04.045 --> 52:06.095
They're not pleased.

52:12.387 --> 52:14.104
Good.

52:14.105 --> 52:15.889
Is it?

52:15.890 --> 52:17.808
Once you go down this road,

52:17.809 --> 52:20.276
what if there's no turning back?

52:39.080 --> 52:41.380
I know how you all must feel.

52:43.251 --> 52:45.669
How desperate you must be to go home

52:45.670 --> 52:50.174
and be embraced by Nassau again.

52:50.175 --> 52:53.343
But I'm here to tell you,

52:53.344 --> 52:56.513
that place no longer exists.

52:56.514 --> 53:00.601
It has been taken from us by a madman.

53:00.602 --> 53:03.771
Held hostage by threat of force

53:03.772 --> 53:06.489
that no one on the island
seems able to resist.

53:07.909 --> 53:10.778
Now I would like to say

53:10.779 --> 53:13.197
that the Urca beckons us.

53:13.198 --> 53:15.749
That we should look the other way.

53:15.750 --> 53:19.453
That the affairs of the beach
should never take precedence

53:19.454 --> 53:21.538
over those of the purse.

53:21.539 --> 53:26.292
But in this case, these issues
would seem to be one and the same.

53:27.929 --> 53:30.798
Even if we could
make it ashore safely,

53:30.799 --> 53:34.718
even if we could refit amidst
the chaos that has been sown,

53:34.719 --> 53:36.804
even if we could ignore all of this

53:36.805 --> 53:39.555
and go on to win the Urca's
gold, what then?

53:41.142 --> 53:45.145
We return home only to have
Vane extort from us

53:45.146 --> 53:48.898
the very prize that we have
sacrificed so much to win?

53:50.618 --> 53:54.905
Nassau was unable to resist him.

53:54.906 --> 53:57.040
But we have yet to have our say.

53:57.041 --> 54:00.994
So at sunrise tomorrow,

54:00.995 --> 54:04.248
we make our terms clear with no room

54:04.249 --> 54:05.999
for bargain or compromise.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.386
Charles Vane
and the animals he commands

54:09.387 --> 54:13.757
have until sunrise tomorrow
to vacate that fort

54:13.758 --> 54:16.142
or so help me God...

54:18.346 --> 54:20.931
I will rain holy hell down upon him.
