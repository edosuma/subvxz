You want to take it out of the bag?

07:28.549 --> 07:29.842
I do, I do. And I, uh...

07:29.928 --> 07:30.893
I don't know how many issues this ran,

07:30.979 --> 07:31.976
not that many though.

07:32.001 --> 07:33.000

07:33.181 --> 07:34.850
It was so poorly received,

07:34.875 --> 07:36.065

- Yes.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.317
For the rest of the

07:38.353 --> 07:41.854
Great, uh, painting by
John Buscema on the front.

07:42.206 --> 07:43.489
And the book is in
really nice shape though.

07:43.525 --> 07:45.158
Here's... here's what
I'm going for though.

07:45.193 --> 07:47.160
- Yeah.
- The Man-Thing.

07:47.195 --> 07:48.327
- That's what I'm gon...
- That's right, it's also...

07:48.363 --> 07:49.546
This guy's first appearance.

07:49.571 --> 07:51.172
Also, predates Swamp
Thing by a couple months.

07:51.282 --> 07:52.699
Are you a Man-Thing guy,

07:52.751 --> 07:53.916
or a Swamp Thing guy?

07:54.002 --> 07:55.501
I have everything Swamp Thing already,

07:55.537 --> 07:57.787
and now I'm turning my
attention to the Man-Thing.

07:58.214 --> 08:00.339
You more a Man-Thing
guy, or Swamp Thing guy?

08:00.375 --> 08:01.874
I love Swamp Thing because

08:01.907 --> 08:05.375
Man-Thing never had his
breakout moment in my world.

08:05.513 --> 08:07.096
- You?
- Swamp thing had

08:07.182 --> 08:09.716
the greatest comic book
stories, maybe, ever told, but...

08:09.768 --> 08:11.884
He went to Hell to save his love.

08:11.970 --> 08:13.352
Like, ahh, it was amazing.

08:13.388 --> 08:15.638
But Man-Thing had some
really good stories too.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.891
He had that one power that I
always thought was so creepy,

08:18.943 --> 08:20.959
was like, if you got scared
of the Man-Thing and...

08:20.984 --> 08:22.968
and if the Man-Thing touched you,

08:22.993 --> 08:25.031
you would burst into flames.

08:25.343 --> 08:27.029
"Whatsoever knows fear

08:27.054 --> 08:29.652
burns at the Man-Thing's touch."

08:29.738 --> 08:32.405
It's also given comic-dom

08:32.457 --> 08:34.907
one of it's greatest, easiest jokes.

08:34.958 --> 08:37.043
Like, "Hey, do you have
a giant-sized Man-Thing?"

08:37.078 --> 08:38.578
[laughter]

08:38.663 --> 08:41.414
We get so much mileage out
of that at the Stash, daily.

08:41.466 --> 08:42.914
- [laughter]
- That's why

08:42.940 --> 08:45.023
it's one of my favorite
books for that reason.

08:45.170 --> 08:46.969
I collect the mucky creatures;

08:47.055 --> 08:48.671
the Swamp Things, the Man-Things.

08:48.757 --> 08:50.256
I could really identify
with that as a kid

08:50.341 --> 08:52.425
because I tried to be,
like, the smart kid,

08:52.477 --> 08:54.143
but I was always the knuckle-dragging

08:54.229 --> 08:57.096
mouth-breather because that's
just what I look like, so...

08:57.182 --> 08:58.564
- Go on.
- I'm pretty Cro-Magnony.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.399

10:43.368 --> 10:45.422
Which game were you best at as a kid?

10:45.438 --> 10:47.639
My game when I was a
kid was "Centipede."

10:47.691 --> 10:49.724
They had it at Cumberland
Farms, right down the street,

10:49.809 --> 10:52.110
so I was always sent to
come home... "Go get milk.

10:52.145 --> 10:54.112
Go get bread." Always...
"Go get 'Entermann's.'"

10:54.147 --> 10:57.365
And when I was there, once
they put in a "Centipede game,

10:57.450 --> 10:59.367

robbed my mother's purse

11:17.420 --> 11:19.671
for money to go play "Centipede."

11:19.723 --> 11:21.723
And then she found out, and she
was like, "I'm missing money."

11:21.808 --> 11:23.007
And I was like, "Oh, I don't know.

11:23.093 --> 11:24.142
Maybe ask Donald."

11:24.177 --> 11:26.561
I threw my brother under the bus

11:26.646 --> 11:29.013
so I could play "Centipede"
at Cumberland Farms.

him on as an unofficial mascot.

14:46.162 --> 14:47.990
You kind of remind me a
little bit of Snapper Carr.

14:48.015 --> 14:49.768
You're kind of like our...
me and Mike's little groupie.

14:49.854 --> 14:51.570
You look like a 16-year-old boy too.

14:51.605 --> 14:53.439
[laughter]

14:53.642 --> 14:54.773
Snapper Ming.

14:54.859 --> 14:56.108
[laughter]

14:56.595 --> 14:57.993
All right, why are you here to sell it?

14:58.079 --> 15:00.946
My wife and I, we just,
uh, welcomed our firstborn.

15:01.032 --> 15:02.498
- Oh, congrats.
- Yeah, thanks.

15:02.583 --> 15:05.084
Maybe put some money away
for him... college, or...

15:05.119 --> 15:06.880
Well, this is definitely
a book that, uh,

15:06.905 --> 15:07.953
we'd love to have on the wall.

15:08.039 --> 15:10.789
I mean, with the Justice League
of America movie coming out,

15:10.841 --> 15:13.042
definitely wall book material.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.793
What are you looking to get for it?

15:14.879 --> 15:16.462
I'm looking to get about $1,200.

15:16.514 --> 15:17.629
$1,200.

15:18.097 --> 15:19.263
What do you think, Mike?

15:19.932 --> 15:21.142
- Right off the bat...
- Yeah.

15:21.167 --> 15:23.769
At the top, there's, uh, some
significant damage up here,

15:23.804 --> 15:24.853
some creasing,

15:24.939 --> 15:27.222
uh, spine damage over here.

15:27.308 --> 15:30.192
I'm sure there's some
discoloration of the pages.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.527
And there is.

15:31.612 --> 15:33.145
Got a chip missing right down there.

15:33.230 --> 15:35.088
- Looks... is that tape?
- Oh.

15:35.113 --> 15:36.755
- There's some tape there.
- Yeah, a little bit of tape there.

15:36.780 --> 15:38.150
I mean, $1,200 is...

15:38.235 --> 15:39.651
I mean, if we're lucky,

15:39.704 --> 15:41.176
- that's what we'd get for it.
- Yeah.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.705
If we're lucky.

15:43.030 --> 15:44.947
After hearing Mike give his

15:44.972 --> 15:46.542
evaluation, uh,

15:46.627 --> 15:48.877
I'm prepared to offer you today...

15:48.963 --> 15:50.379
$700.

15:50.464 --> 15:51.880
[sighs]

15:51.966 --> 15:53.665
Your kid can buy one book for college.

15:53.718 --> 15:55.501
[laughter]

15:55.788 --> 15:59.707
Any way you could do 11? $1,100?

16:00.123 --> 16:01.724
I could do $800.

16:02.404 --> 16:06.395
I'll go down to $1,000,
that's my bottom.

16:06.480 --> 16:07.730
I pretty...

16:07.799 --> 16:09.665
pretty stuck on the $800.

16:09.734 --> 16:10.928
- I don't think I can go higher than that.
- Okay.

16:10.968 --> 16:12.044
Yeah, no. I understand.

16:12.340 --> 16:13.289
Thanks for, uh,

16:13.314 --> 16:14.403
taking a look at it though.

16:14.488 --> 16:15.547
- Thanks for bringing it in.
- Appreciate it.

16:15.572 --> 16:16.654
Um,

16:17.550 --> 16:19.399
- all right, thanks.
- Thanks.

16:19.424 --> 16:20.423
See you around.

16:44.362 --> 16:45.112
A Beatles game?

16:45.137 --> 16:46.506
I've never seen this before.

16:46.531 --> 16:54.044
- _
- <i>[upbeat rock music]</i>

16:54.069 --> 16:55.235
Beatles;

16:55.391 --> 16:58.371
are they the world's greatest band?

16:58.396 --> 16:59.810
That's right. Absolutely.

16:59.896 --> 17:00.811
- You think so?
- They are not.

17:00.897 --> 17:01.869
- No?
- No.

17:01.894 --> 17:03.354
How can you say that?

17:03.379 --> 17:04.602
[British accent] My name
is Paul McCartney, you know.

17:04.627 --> 17:06.319
I'd have written five
million songs, you know.

17:06.952 --> 17:07.952
I'm still not convinced.

17:07.987 --> 17:09.487
[laughter]

17:09.539 --> 17:11.204
Who else can you do?
That was a great Paul.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.240
Oh, the other Beatles and many others.

17:13.265 --> 17:14.407
Let me hear... let me hear some.

17:14.493 --> 17:16.204
[as George] Hi, this is
George Harrison, you know.

17:16.230 --> 17:18.041
Hey, there. I'm the quiet one.

17:18.067 --> 17:19.707
That's Ringo Starr on me drums there.

17:19.792 --> 17:20.814
[nasally voice] Thank
you very much, everybody.

17:20.839 --> 17:21.809
It's John.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.334
Can even do Yoko, believe it or not.

17:23.419 --> 17:24.667
Let me hear some Yoko.

17:24.721 --> 17:26.337
[vocalizing] Ahh!

17:26.388 --> 17:28.672
[laughter]

17:28.725 --> 17:30.725
Oy-oy-oy-oy-oy.

17:30.810 --> 17:31.726
That sounded like Mike.

17:31.811 --> 17:33.978
[laughter]

17:34.186 --> 17:36.069
You've got to give
them some credit though.

17:36.094 --> 17:39.016
I mean, they changed music forever.

17:39.102 --> 17:40.684
I'll give 'em "Helter Skelter."

17:40.737 --> 17:41.483
Okay.

17:41.508 --> 17:43.237
I'll give 'em "While
My Guitar Gently Weeps."

17:43.322 --> 17:44.171
Okay.

17:44.196 --> 17:46.140
I'll give 'em "Across the Universe."

17:46.165 --> 17:47.415
Let's give... you're
giving them a lot, so...

17:47.440 --> 17:48.856
- Yeah.
- I'll give 'em three.

17:48.884 --> 17:50.838
[laughter]

17:50.863 --> 17:52.530
- Big Beatles fan?
- Yeah, of course.

17:52.615 --> 17:53.864
Nothing but respect for the Beatles.

17:53.950 --> 17:55.366
Even, like, the early stuff,

17:55.451 --> 17:57.618
before they got very
inventive and creative.

17:57.703 --> 17:59.537
One of my favorite things to do in a car

17:59.622 --> 18:01.789
is listen to "Strawberry Fields,"

18:01.874 --> 18:03.614
and it's got that wall of sound mix,

18:03.639 --> 18:05.676
and you know how in
the car you have a fader

18:05.711 --> 18:08.379
so you could put the speakers
to the left or to the right...

18:08.431 --> 18:10.548
If you turn it all the way to the left,

18:10.633 --> 18:12.216
you just hear the vocal tracks

18:12.268 --> 18:14.063
and it sounds like he's
singing it acapella.

18:14.088 --> 18:16.720
It's a really cool way
to listen to the song.

18:16.806 --> 18:17.888
Really? I thought, maybe,
you were gonna tell me

18:17.974 --> 18:19.440
you could hear some backward masking

18:19.525 --> 18:20.975
- or some sort of, like...
- I'm listening for

18:21.000 --> 18:21.976
Hidden messages.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.671
Yeah, there... instead
of "Paul is dead,"

18:23.696 --> 18:25.563
it's like, "pay attention to the road."

18:25.615 --> 18:28.732
[laughter]

18:28.785 --> 18:30.284
So where'd you get the game at?

18:30.369 --> 18:31.902
I got it through the mail

18:31.988 --> 18:33.421
from some lady in the Midwest in the...

18:33.446 --> 18:35.456
in the 1990s, and I
have another one at home,

18:35.541 --> 18:37.496
so I'm trying to sell this
one to get some extra cash.

18:37.521 --> 18:38.331
Oh, you...

18:38.356 --> 18:40.721
- you a big Beatles collector?
- At one time, yeah.

18:40.746 --> 18:42.246
It looks like barbed
wire around the wig.

18:42.331 --> 18:44.081
- What... yeah, what is that?
- It's flippin'.

18:44.106 --> 18:45.055
- You're flippin'.
- You're flippin' your wig.

18:45.080 --> 18:45.798
There you go.

18:45.823 --> 18:46.966
Is that a new conspiracy theory?

18:46.991 --> 18:48.312
All four of them wore wigs?

18:48.337 --> 18:49.253
[laughs] No.

18:49.338 --> 18:50.754
[laughter]

18:50.807 --> 18:51.619
Can I open it?

18:51.644 --> 18:52.926
Sure, right ahead.

18:53.142 --> 18:54.758
- Oh. Wow.
- Take some of this out.

18:54.811 --> 18:55.926
Look at that.

18:56.366 --> 18:57.645
Paul.

18:58.164 --> 19:00.419
Um, George... dead or alive?

19:00.444 --> 19:01.393
- Dead.
- Dead.

19:01.418 --> 19:02.099
Not living.

19:02.151 --> 19:03.377
John... well, we know John.

19:03.402 --> 19:04.368
Won't have to ask.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.631
How old were you when
the Beatles invaded?

19:06.656 --> 19:07.938
I was five years old.

19:08.024 --> 19:09.607
And in the same era,
I did toy commercials.

19:09.632 --> 19:11.444
Really? What toy commercials did you do?

19:11.469 --> 19:13.848
Uh, Blippo. Remco Toys 1965.

19:13.873 --> 19:15.663
G.I. Joe, Capsule, '79.

19:15.748 --> 19:18.096
Why'd you stop doing the,
uh, the commercial gig?

19:18.121 --> 19:19.617
Oh, it's so long ago,
I don't even remember.

19:19.702 --> 19:21.785
Are you sure you weren't doing
a little bit of Beatle shrooms

19:21.838 --> 19:24.570
and, uh... uh... uh... are you
sure you were really on commercials?

19:24.595 --> 19:25.923
You know you're not
really George Harrison.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.508
[laughter]

19:27.593 --> 19:29.627
[as George] Well, you
never know, you know. Hey.

19:29.679 --> 19:31.091
Can I take out the, uh, the board?

19:31.116 --> 19:32.296
Yeah, go right ahead.

19:32.569 --> 19:34.161
Right, there's some
beautiful artwork on this,

19:34.186 --> 19:36.086
I'm gonna guess. Something
really psychedelic

19:36.111 --> 19:37.885
and crazy and out there.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.436
- Oh, well.
- Yeah.

19:39.472 --> 19:41.484
- [laughs]
- They're not that handsome.

19:41.509 --> 19:42.796
- No, they weren't.
- Oh, come on.

19:42.821 --> 19:43.903
I feel like in 1960

19:43.928 --> 19:44.808
I could have been in a boy band.

19:44.861 --> 19:47.194
[laughter]

19:47.280 --> 19:48.946
All right, how much you want for this?

19:49.211 --> 19:50.711
- $125.
- Pfft.

19:50.736 --> 19:51.649
Get out of here.

19:51.734 --> 19:53.984
- [laughter]
- I looked at it online.

19:54.036 --> 19:56.203
$125, are you crazy?

19:56.544 --> 19:58.489
- No.
- Come on.

19:59.036 --> 20:00.690
Throw me out a more realistic number.

20:00.715 --> 20:02.412
- More realistic number?
- Yeah.

20:02.437 --> 20:03.386
Okay.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.162
Gimme $80 and it's done.

20:05.248 --> 20:06.797
<i>[tense music]</i>

20:06.832 --> 20:08.253
$60. That's it.

20:08.278 --> 20:10.334
I can't do any better than $60.

20:10.386 --> 20:12.920
How about $65?

20:13.837 --> 20:14.940
Ah, I can't...

20:14.965 --> 20:16.515
- I can't haggle over five bucks,
- Come on.

20:16.540 --> 20:17.591
so $65.

20:17.677 --> 20:18.642
- Done.
- Done. Sold.

20:18.678 --> 20:20.010
All right.

20:20.376 --> 20:21.492
$65.

20:21.517 --> 20:22.766
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

20:22.791 --> 20:24.515
Been a pleasure talking to you guys.

20:24.567 --> 20:26.734
I always thought of us, you
know, when Ming's around,

20:26.819 --> 20:28.931
as the Fab Four of
the... of the comic book

20:28.956 --> 20:30.771
- retailing world. Yeah.
- Yeah?

20:30.796 --> 20:32.935
So you got Walter, shy the one,

20:32.959 --> 20:34.293
Mike, the funny one,

20:34.294 --> 20:35.991
Ming, the cute one,

20:36.047 --> 20:37.972
and me, the one that still
lives with his parents,

20:37.996 --> 20:39.485
and is grossly overweight.

20:39.486 --> 20:40.614
Was that a thing?

20:40.638 --> 20:42.204
That was a 50-year-old.

20:42.228 --> 20:43.148
[laughter]

20:43.173 --> 20:45.173
Didn't see the munchies.

20:45.225 --> 20:47.203
All good things must come to an end,

20:47.229 --> 20:49.128
just like the episode of this show.

20:49.152 --> 20:50.978
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.
