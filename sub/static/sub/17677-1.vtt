01:24.646 --> 01:31.443
You know, sometimes
when I'm Iaying in bed at night

01:31.527 --> 01:34.231
trying to get to sIeep,

01:34.321 --> 01:40.904
aII I can think about is this goaI
of trying to paint a Vermeer.

01:40.993 --> 01:44.444
You know, reaIIy, I'm gonna try
to paint a Vermeer.

01:44.538 --> 01:50.575
And, at the face of it,
that seems aImost impossibIe.

01:50.668 --> 01:53.669
And I don't know if I couId do it.

01:55.923 --> 01:59.042
You know, it'II be pretty remarkabIe if I can,

02:00.343 --> 02:02.382
because I'm not a painter.

02:13.521 --> 02:16.770
The Vermeer he's talking about
is Johannes Vermeer,

02:16.857 --> 02:19.430
the Dutch artist from the 1600s.

02:19.526 --> 02:23.108
Some consider him the greatest painter
of all time.

02:23.195 --> 02:27.940
When you look at a Vermeer,
it seems like more than paint on canvas.

02:28.033 --> 02:32.943
lt seems to glow like the image on
a movie screen.

02:33.079 --> 02:38.618
That magical quality has mystified
the world for 350 years.

02:38.708 --> 02:40.784
How did Vermeer do it?

02:40.877 --> 02:43.284
Dutch artists typically learnt
by apprenticeship

02:43.379 --> 02:47.079
and they kept written records
to prove their training.

02:47.174 --> 02:50.756
But no such documents have ever
been found about Vermeer.

02:50.844 --> 02:54.923
And strangely, when you x-ray
these intricate images,

02:55.014 --> 02:58.631
you don't find the usual
artist's sketches underneath.

02:58.725 --> 03:02.259
lt's as if Vermeer were
some unfathomable genius

03:02.353 --> 03:07.145
who could just walk up to a canvas
and magically paint with light.

03:10.151 --> 03:12.903
lt's possible that Vermeer
was using technology

03:12.987 --> 03:15.063
to make these beautiful paintings.

03:15.156 --> 03:18.987
lf he did that, and, of course,
there's no documentation that he did this,

03:19.076 --> 03:25.789
it's possibIe he couId paint some pretty
remarkabIe pictures without a Iot of training.

03:25.873 --> 03:31.163
It's possibIe that he was more
of an experimenter,

03:31.252 --> 03:33.624
more of a tinkerer, more of a geek.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.710
And, in that way, l feel a kinship with him,
because l'm a computer graphics guy,

03:37.800 --> 03:41.298
and we use technoIogy
to make a reaIistic, beautifuI image,

03:41.386 --> 03:44.137
and it's possibIe that's exactIy
what Vermeer was doing.

03:45.681 --> 03:48.682
Tim Jenison is not a painter,
he's an inventor.

03:48.809 --> 03:52.058
He's always had a talent for figuring out
how things work.

03:52.145 --> 03:56.059
When Tim was growing up in lowa,
he got a broken player piano,

03:56.148 --> 03:58.817
repaired it, and taught himself
to play swing music

03:58.901 --> 04:03.277
by slowing down the piano rolls
so he could follow Fats Waller's fingers.

04:03.446 --> 04:06.980
Tim played keyboards in a rock band
for a couple of years

04:07.074 --> 04:10.692
and taught himself to fix anything electronic
that broke.

04:10.869 --> 04:12.363
The amazing wizard!

04:12.537 --> 04:14.862
He got married, had a family,

04:14.956 --> 04:19.083
and built a business repairing
pinball machines and video games.

04:19.209 --> 04:23.621
Then, around 1990, he invented
a way to turn personal computers

04:23.713 --> 04:26.204
into TVstudios for live broadcasting.

04:26.549 --> 04:30.000
He called it the Video Toaster,
and it won him an Emmy.

04:30.093 --> 04:33.592
That led him to other amazing achievements
like LightWave,

04:33.680 --> 04:36.170
a program for rendering 3D images,

04:36.265 --> 04:40.559
which won an Emmy for his company,
NewTek, in 2003.

04:40.894 --> 04:43.811
Tim's now based in San Antonio, Texas,

04:43.897 --> 04:46.518
and his company produces the TriCaster,

04:46.607 --> 04:50.190
used in broadcast, web,
and live performance.

04:50.903 --> 04:54.852
All this has given Tim the money
and free time to make things like this,

04:56.616 --> 04:58.822
Frankie, his lip-syncing duck.

05:02.079 --> 05:07.582
A plane made entirely of stuff from
a home improvement store.

05:07.667 --> 05:08.698
It's an eIectric moth.

05:08.793 --> 05:10.500
His electric moth.

05:10.586 --> 05:14.369
As you raise the Iight,
it comes up off the fIoor,

05:14.464 --> 05:17.963
and it stays at exactIy the same distance
under the Iight.

05:19.301 --> 05:21.128
And this.

05:32.062 --> 05:35.727
Here's the pipe organ Tim put together
from four different churches.

05:35.815 --> 05:38.436
Once I got started,
you have to have more pipes,

05:38.526 --> 05:42.143
because it's never quite enough,
so I've got three pipe organs here,

05:42.279 --> 05:45.647
pIus an eIectronic organ
that I'm using for the keyboard.

05:45.740 --> 05:49.073
Tim and I have been friends
for a reaIIy Iong time.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.077
If there was an artist,
he wouId draw it, what you see...

05:52.162 --> 05:54.914
We've cried together
at space shuttle launches.

05:54.998 --> 05:57.239
We flew his Learjet down to Cabo San Lucas

05:57.333 --> 05:59.906
to see the total eclipse of the sun.

06:00.002 --> 06:01.876
So, the deviI's in there.

06:01.962 --> 06:06.090
This is Penn, the Iast day he was abIe to see

06:06.174 --> 06:10.041
before he Iost God's most precious gift
Iooking at the ecIipse.

06:10.845 --> 06:13.928
Tim's been weightless
in an astronaut-training plane

06:14.014 --> 06:16.469
and he arranged for me to try it, too.

06:16.558 --> 06:19.843
l vomited into my own hair.

06:19.936 --> 06:24.264
Tim was not and is not a painter.

06:24.523 --> 06:28.816
So I didn't know he had
this whoIe IittIe sub-obsession

06:28.901 --> 06:31.474
with Vermeer.

06:31.695 --> 06:35.775
Tim's Vermeer project started
1 1 years back, in 2002,

06:35.866 --> 06:40.278
when his daughter gave him a copy
of David Hockney's book, Secret KnowIedge.

06:40.369 --> 06:44.616
Hockney wrote that
when pictures started to look less like this,

06:44.706 --> 06:46.284
and more like this,

06:46.374 --> 06:49.957
that was because artists had found
new tools to help them.

06:50.044 --> 06:55.204
ln 17th-century Holland, high quality lenses
and mirrors were in use everywhere.

06:55.299 --> 06:57.457
Telescopes were all the rage

06:57.550 --> 07:02.425
and science hobbyists were experimenting
with ways to project live images.

07:02.513 --> 07:05.466
Hockney challenged conventional wisdom
by suggesting

07:05.557 --> 07:09.257
that when artists of Vermeer's day
began to paint more accurately,

07:09.352 --> 07:13.396
they were no longer using just their eyes
and their imaginations.

07:13.481 --> 07:18.023
They were secretly getting help from
optical machines, like the camera obscura.

07:18.109 --> 07:22.486
Camera obscura is Latin for ''dark room''.

07:22.697 --> 07:24.488
Build a box, any size.

07:24.573 --> 07:26.482
Could be the size of a shoebox,

07:26.575 --> 07:29.445
but let's make this one big enough
to stand inside.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.409
lt's a dark room.

07:31.537 --> 07:35.830
Drill a little hole in one side of the box
and you see something surprising.

07:35.916 --> 07:39.450
The image of whatever is outside the box,
in the light,

07:39.544 --> 07:44.620
is projected on the wall opposite the hole,
only it's upside down and backwards.

07:44.757 --> 07:48.836
You can make the image brighter and clearer
by putting a lens in the hole,

07:48.927 --> 07:51.797
and you can change
the size of the image on the wall

07:51.888 --> 07:55.090
by changing the curvature
and position of the lens.

07:57.893 --> 08:00.727
Here's David Hockney on a TVspecial.

08:00.812 --> 08:03.100
He's inside a camera obscura,

08:03.189 --> 08:07.435
tracing the image of a live model
projected through a lens.

08:10.028 --> 08:11.937
Hockney was mostly focused on

08:12.030 --> 08:15.445
how a painter could have traced images
through a lens.

08:16.283 --> 08:21.988
To me, what was most striking
about the Vermeers, as a video guy,

08:22.080 --> 08:25.282
l'm looking at this image,
and l see a video signal.

08:25.374 --> 08:30.534
l see something that looks like
it came out of a video camera.

08:30.629 --> 08:35.539
So I thought about how a painter
couId actuaIIy copy that.

08:35.633 --> 08:40.875
Now, most peopIe that have pIayed
with a camera obscura

08:40.971 --> 08:45.513
got the idea that they couId take that
projected image and somehow paint on it.

08:45.641 --> 08:49.638
WeII, I've tried that and a Iot of peopIe
have tried it, it's impossibIe.

08:49.770 --> 08:53.019
What happens is it actuaIIy fights you,
it works against you,

08:53.106 --> 08:54.564
it's worse than nothing at aII.

08:55.232 --> 08:57.439
Painting on a projection just doesn't work.

08:57.526 --> 09:01.108
Here's a blue that matches very closely
the blue in the projection.

09:01.196 --> 09:03.069
lmagine this is wet paint.

09:03.156 --> 09:07.200
When you put it into the projection,
it looks way too dark.

09:07.326 --> 09:09.567
On the other hand, here's a perfect match.

09:09.661 --> 09:12.827
The colour that matches
the projected colour just right.

09:12.914 --> 09:15.950
The only colour that'll ever do that is white.

09:18.919 --> 09:21.623
Tim went around
the world studying Vermeer.

09:26.676 --> 09:29.510
They called it ''painting with light. ''
Vermeer ''painted with light. ''

09:29.595 --> 09:32.132
You can't paint with light,
you have to paint with paint.

09:32.222 --> 09:37.927
And so what they're really talking about
is this verisimilitude that Vermeer has,

09:38.018 --> 09:41.434
that it just pops.

09:41.521 --> 09:46.266
You see it from across the room
and it looks like a slide,

09:46.359 --> 09:49.359
it looks like a colour slide of Kodachrome.

10:10.504 --> 10:14.501
Seeing the Vermeers in person
was a revelation.

10:14.591 --> 10:17.840
lt reinforced to me that
l was on the right track.

10:17.927 --> 10:23.466
That what l was seeing was an accurate
representation of the colour in that room.

10:25.808 --> 10:32.474
I just had a hunch that there must be a way
to actuaIIy get the coIours accurate,

10:32.564 --> 10:33.975
with mechanicaI means.

10:34.065 --> 10:36.307
Some way you couId do that
in the 1 7th century.

10:36.526 --> 10:41.816
I remember just having this vague idea
of comparing two coIours with a mirror,

10:41.905 --> 10:44.443
and it didn't go any farther than that
for a Iong time.

10:44.532 --> 10:45.813
Sitting in the bathtub,

10:45.909 --> 10:48.992
you know, that's I guess where you have
your eureka moments,

10:49.078 --> 10:52.612
but, I don't know,
there's something about bath water...

10:52.706 --> 10:54.579
It's just very, very reIaxing.

10:54.666 --> 10:58.745
And I was just picturing that mirror
hanging there in space,

10:58.836 --> 11:02.252
and I pictured what I wouId see,
and there it was.

11:02.339 --> 11:07.000
And so I grabbed a piece of paper,
being carefuI not to get it wet,

11:07.093 --> 11:10.793
made a sketch, and that was where l realised

11:10.888 --> 11:14.932
Vermeer couId have used a mirror
to paint those paintings.

11:19.103 --> 11:23.764
To test this l propped up a high school
photograph of my father-in-law on the table.

11:23.857 --> 11:26.811
l put a piece of Masonite down here
to paint on.

11:26.901 --> 11:30.768
l set a small mirror at a 45-degree angle.

11:32.448 --> 11:36.148
And for the first time in my life,
l did just what Vermeer may have done.

11:36.284 --> 11:39.735
l picked up some oil paints and a brush.

11:39.829 --> 11:42.201
In Vermeer's camera
this wouId be a projection,

11:42.289 --> 11:44.282
a Iens is projecting this image.

11:44.374 --> 11:47.873
But to show the actuaI
mirror painting process,

11:47.961 --> 11:49.419
we're using a photograph here.

11:49.504 --> 11:55.007
You can see that there's a refIection,
and then there's my canvas down here.

11:55.092 --> 11:59.302
And right at the edge of the mirror,
I can see both things at once.

11:59.387 --> 12:01.011
I'm just going to appIy paint

12:01.097 --> 12:05.509
and either darken or Iighten the paint
untiI it's the same exact coIour.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.767
And at that point,
when it's exactIy the same coIour,

12:08.853 --> 12:10.845
the edge of the mirror wiII disappear.

12:10.938 --> 12:15.018
AII right, and I'm an idiot at this,

12:15.108 --> 12:20.647
I have done this process
exactIy twice in my Iife before.

12:23.073 --> 12:26.940
What I'm doing is
I'm moving my head up and down

12:27.035 --> 12:30.735
so that I can see first the originaI
and then my canvas.

12:30.830 --> 12:34.115
I'm Iooking at both things at the same time.

12:34.208 --> 12:36.580
Right on the forehead,
you can see that they match,

12:36.668 --> 12:38.993
because you can't reaIIy see
the edge of the mirror.

12:39.087 --> 12:42.253
That's, that's your cIue that
you've matched the paint exactIy.

12:42.340 --> 12:46.040
It's not subjective, it's objective.

12:46.134 --> 12:50.630
I'm a piece of human photographic fiIm
at that point.

12:53.557 --> 12:56.344
What you're doing here
is you're essentiaIIy bIending?

12:56.435 --> 13:03.053
Yep, I am either darkening or Iightening
the paint that's aIready on the surface.

13:03.149 --> 13:06.849
You aren't tracing any Iines,
'cause there are no Iines.

13:06.944 --> 13:11.818
Yeah, that's a characteristic of the Vermeers
that makes them unusuaI,

13:11.906 --> 13:13.448
is that there weren't Iines,

13:13.532 --> 13:16.782
and there weren't any Iines
drawn underneath the paint either.

13:17.619 --> 13:20.952
It Iooks Iike there's these bIobs
that are emerging into a picture.

13:21.039 --> 13:22.948
It doesn't Iook Iike...

13:23.040 --> 13:26.456
The order you're doing stuff in is not a...

13:26.543 --> 13:28.251
It's not being done mentaIIy.

13:28.337 --> 13:29.416
No, it's...

13:29.504 --> 13:31.295
And that's what's so nutty about it.

13:31.381 --> 13:35.248
You know, if I was better at this,
it may be more systematic,

13:35.342 --> 13:38.711
I may evoIve into doing it
more systematicaIIy, but...

13:38.804 --> 13:40.511
No matter what I've tried,

13:40.597 --> 13:44.890
if I just spend enough time
comparing the mirror to the canvas

13:44.975 --> 13:49.304
and stirring the paint around,
it ends up Iooking Iike a photograph.

13:54.650 --> 13:57.900
And this was the result of Tim's experiment,

13:57.986 --> 14:00.559
it took him five hours.

14:03.241 --> 14:05.992
Not bad for a first oil painting.

14:14.208 --> 14:19.794
The father-in-law picture was proof enough
in my mind that Vermeer probably did this.

14:19.880 --> 14:25.039
However, my father-in-law doesn't look like
a 17th-century Dutch woman,

14:25.134 --> 14:29.961
so l don't think it would be very
convincing evidence for a lot of people.

14:30.055 --> 14:34.052
So, l thought the best way would be
to really do a Vermeer.

14:34.142 --> 14:37.640
l had the suspicion that it was exactly
the same thing.

14:37.728 --> 14:40.764
lf l could do the father-in-law,
l could paint a Vermeer.

14:40.856 --> 14:45.019
lt seemed to me the most powerful
demonstration of the idea.

14:45.109 --> 14:50.529
The reason l chose The Music Lesson
is probably because, of all the paintings,

14:50.614 --> 14:54.658
l think The Music Lesson
is a great little laboratory,

14:54.742 --> 14:59.404
because it's so complete
and so self-contained.

14:59.496 --> 15:02.616
You know where the windows are,
you know how big the windows are,

15:02.707 --> 15:06.158
you can reconstruct the harpsichord
independent of the painting,

15:06.252 --> 15:10.960
the Spanish chair, the viola da gamba,
the rug, all these things could be procured,

15:11.048 --> 15:16.172
and their appearance is gonna be what it is,
independent of Vermeer's painting.

15:18.679 --> 15:22.178
lt's a little scientific experiment
waiting to happen.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.929
Before Tim went to all that trouble,

15:30.022 --> 15:32.939
we thought he should run
his idea by a working artist.

15:33.024 --> 15:34.269
So we called up our friend,

15:34.359 --> 15:37.608
Los Angeles-based painter
and entertainer, Martin Mull,

15:37.695 --> 15:42.440
and asked him to meet Tim
at a studio in Las Vegas and see his gizmo.

15:42.532 --> 15:45.070
Oh, my God.

15:45.160 --> 15:48.610
Oh, my God.

15:52.165 --> 15:53.446
HoIy cow.

15:53.542 --> 15:57.206
Took me about haIf an hour
to Iearn how to operate a paintbrush.

15:57.295 --> 16:00.628
Good for you, it took me 40 years.

16:00.714 --> 16:06.384
WeII, and the beauty of this technique
is that you can make mistakes

16:06.469 --> 16:10.632
and see what you did wrong instantIy
and try to fix it.

16:10.723 --> 16:12.680
This is astounding.

16:12.766 --> 16:14.557
So this is a camera obscura,

16:14.643 --> 16:19.138
typicaI of the type
that couId be found in the 1600's.

16:19.230 --> 16:22.396
This type of camera obscura
is caIIed a ''box camera obscura''.

16:22.483 --> 16:24.724
It generaIIy had a ground gIass Iike this.

16:24.818 --> 16:28.151
It has the abiIity to refocus
by moving the Iens in and out.

16:28.237 --> 16:32.021
The generaI consensus of peopIe
that beIieve Vermeer used optics

16:32.116 --> 16:36.860
was that he may have Iooked at that image
and been inspired by it.

16:36.953 --> 16:37.984
Yeah.

16:38.079 --> 16:39.193
And that's the end of the story.

16:42.082 --> 16:44.655
So now that we know there's a way
to copy the coIours exactIy,

16:44.751 --> 16:46.660
I'm proposing an aIternate history
of Vermeer.

16:46.753 --> 16:47.784
Okay.

16:47.879 --> 16:50.001
His father's an art deaIer,
he knows something about art,

16:50.089 --> 16:51.631
he wants to make a painting.

16:52.007 --> 16:53.466
He Iooks at this image...

16:53.550 --> 16:54.629
Okay.

16:54.718 --> 16:56.924
There's my daughter, NataIie.

16:57.178 --> 17:01.507
What if Vermeer took the camera,
turned it sideways, and now it's verticaI,

17:01.599 --> 17:04.172
-Iike my father-in-Iaw picture.
-Okay.

17:05.268 --> 17:07.640
He takes his canvas,

17:09.271 --> 17:13.221
and, the secret ingredient,

17:13.317 --> 17:14.479
the mirror.

17:14.568 --> 17:15.943
He positions the mirror here.

17:16.027 --> 17:17.686
Which corrects the inversion?

17:17.779 --> 17:20.020
-Yeah, it brings it back...
-And everything...

17:20.114 --> 17:23.483
And there it is! CIear as can be.

17:23.575 --> 17:27.655
So if he's in his Iiving room,
he puts up some curtains,

17:27.746 --> 17:28.990
controIs the Iight,

17:29.080 --> 17:32.116
and now picks up his brush
and starts to paint.

17:33.709 --> 17:38.287
My guess is that the Girl with the Red Hat
is that first painting.

17:38.380 --> 17:40.835
-Wow.
-It's painted over the top of another painting.

17:40.923 --> 17:43.877
We can x-ray it and see that
there's something eIse underneath,

17:43.968 --> 17:45.960
so maybe this was just
a throwaway experiment.

18:00.732 --> 18:03.222
So I understand, Tim,
that when you go back to Texas,

18:03.317 --> 18:09.817
you're going to construct a repIica
of the exact room where Vermeer painted?

18:09.906 --> 18:11.020
Yeah.

18:11.115 --> 18:17.235
And you're going
to do a painting in his stead,

18:17.329 --> 18:18.574
am I right?

18:18.663 --> 18:19.742
Yep.

18:19.831 --> 18:23.413
Many of Vermeer's paintings appear
to have been painted in the same room,

18:23.501 --> 18:25.244
likely the north-facing room

18:25.336 --> 18:28.004
on the second floor
of the house Vermeer lived in.

18:28.088 --> 18:31.670
That's the room Tim plans to construct.

18:31.799 --> 18:37.919
I reaIIy hope to see firsthand
what Vermeer was up against,

18:38.013 --> 18:40.338
if he was using this technique.

18:42.308 --> 18:47.728
And try to get some idea

18:47.813 --> 18:49.639
of how Iong it wouId take,

18:49.731 --> 18:52.304
just to get the conditions right...

18:52.400 --> 18:55.603
Just mundane things Iike how much
usabIe Iighting do you get in a day.

18:55.694 --> 18:57.568
So you're not going to use any artificiaI Iight.

18:57.654 --> 18:58.733
That's right.

18:58.822 --> 19:02.404
And I'm onIy going to use materiaIs
that Vermeer wouId have had.

19:02.492 --> 19:03.571
Okay.

19:03.659 --> 19:06.150
So, I'm going to force myseIf
into the constraint

19:06.245 --> 19:10.871
of having to grind the pigments
and, you know, make the paint,

19:10.957 --> 19:15.037
and use onIy pigments that he had access to
or that he used in his paintings.

19:15.127 --> 19:19.670
For his experiment, Tim wanted
to recreate, as closely as possible,

19:19.756 --> 19:22.329
the conditions that Vermeer
was working with.

19:22.425 --> 19:25.212
Back then you couIdn't just run down
to the paint store

19:25.303 --> 19:26.796
and pick up a tube of paint,

19:26.887 --> 19:30.053
so Tim had to Iearn how to grind
and mix the pigments,

19:30.140 --> 19:33.140
which I'm now taIking about
something I know nothing about,

19:33.226 --> 19:37.057
but of grinding the pigments
and adding in the oiI

19:37.187 --> 19:38.765
and however you make paint.

19:38.856 --> 19:41.856
If it were Ieft to me to make paint,
there wouId be no paint.

19:43.067 --> 19:44.858
I aIso Iearnt how to make Ienses.

19:44.944 --> 19:47.731
I couIdn't use a modern Iens,
they're too good.

19:47.821 --> 19:49.150
So I had to buiId one.

19:49.239 --> 19:53.402
So I had to make the form on a Iathe,
I had to meIt the gIass,

19:53.493 --> 19:56.992
I had to poIish it with
various grades of abrasives,

19:57.079 --> 20:00.863
just the way they made Ienses
in the 1 7th century.

20:00.957 --> 20:03.115
To be sure he was getting everything right,

20:03.209 --> 20:06.376
Tim took some time off of work
to fly to Holland.

20:06.462 --> 20:09.712
He visited Delft,
the city where Vermeer had lived,

20:09.798 --> 20:12.253
and studied the light and the architecture.

20:12.342 --> 20:15.841
So this is it, this is where Vermeer painted
those magicaI Iight pictures.

20:15.928 --> 20:19.213
He learnt to read Dutch,
he consulted with experts,

20:19.306 --> 20:23.599
measured furniture in museums,
and immersed himself in Vermeer's world.

20:30.983 --> 20:33.604
AII right, so move it in. Okay, good.

20:54.919 --> 20:59.415
I wouId Iike to get one exactIy Iike this.
Do you think you couId make one?

20:59.507 --> 21:00.704
That's possibIe, yes.

21:27.572 --> 21:31.900
When he got back to San Antonio,
Tim rented a warehouse that faced North,

21:31.992 --> 21:33.534
just like Vermeer's studio,

21:33.618 --> 21:36.489
and invited Professor Philip Steadman
over from London

21:36.579 --> 21:38.737
to look over his experiment.

21:38.831 --> 21:42.081
While some believe that Vermeer
painted from his imagination,

21:42.167 --> 21:46.247
Steadman found evidence that
Vermeer used optics.

21:46.337 --> 21:49.421
Steadman is the author of Vermeer's Camera.

21:49.507 --> 21:53.089
ln this book, Steadman analyses six
of Vermeer's paintings

21:53.177 --> 21:55.928
to determine the layout of Vermeer's studio.

21:56.012 --> 21:58.254
Then he uses geometry to figure out

21:58.348 --> 22:01.514
where the lens in a camera obscura
would have to go

22:01.600 --> 22:04.055
to match each painting's viewpoint.

22:04.144 --> 22:07.927
Now he calculates the size of the projection
on Vermeer's back wall,

22:08.022 --> 22:12.315
and compares that to the size
of the corresponding painting.

22:13.944 --> 22:17.229
For all six, the sizes match exactly.

22:18.281 --> 22:21.317
lt doesn't seem like
that would happen by chance.

22:21.784 --> 22:25.235
Pretty convincing evidence
that Vermeer used a lens.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.322
WeII, teII me about what you're doing.

22:29.415 --> 22:32.451
Steadman's discovery fit perfectly
with Tim's mirror,

22:32.543 --> 22:35.164
so now Tim set up a test that would use both.

22:35.253 --> 22:38.586
And this, we wiII make
an attempt at painting this.

22:38.673 --> 22:40.831
-Okay.
-Using the mirror.

22:40.925 --> 22:42.383
So, now Iet's go inside the booth.

22:42.468 --> 22:43.463
Yeah.

22:43.552 --> 22:45.794
He and Steadman would try to paint a jug

22:45.887 --> 22:49.635
using his comparator mirror
inside a camera obscura,

22:49.724 --> 22:52.096
as Tim thought Vermeer had done.

22:55.979 --> 22:57.603
They take turns painting.

22:57.731 --> 23:00.304
lt doesn't matter who does the brushstrokes,

23:00.400 --> 23:02.273
the process is objective,

23:02.360 --> 23:05.858
and any painter who uses it,
gets the same result.

23:10.283 --> 23:12.952
David Hockney's book came out
just after mine.

23:13.035 --> 23:14.992
What do you remember about the reaction?

23:15.079 --> 23:20.072
There was quite a controversy around
both books, wasn't there?

23:20.166 --> 23:22.242
Enormous, yes, yes.

23:22.335 --> 23:27.577
There was a Iot of upset, a reaIIy deep
anguish amongst the art historians.

23:27.672 --> 23:31.966
The painters were reIaxed.

23:32.093 --> 23:36.006
They said, you know,
''This is a technoIogy, fine, okay.''

23:36.096 --> 23:41.849
But there was something, a reaIIy deep
hurt amongst some of the art historians

23:41.934 --> 23:47.355
which was to do with intrusion
of amateurs and crass rationaIists

23:47.439 --> 23:50.689
into the preserves of art history.

23:50.775 --> 23:55.686
It was to do with a misunderstanding
of the nature of art

23:55.779 --> 23:58.614
and cheating and genius,

23:58.698 --> 24:03.525
and the idea that an opticaI method
is some sort of cheat,

24:03.619 --> 24:05.327
because these are very accurate,
measured perspectives.

24:05.412 --> 24:10.239
So, there are two ways you can do them.
You can produce them opticaIIy,

24:10.583 --> 24:12.741
or you can set them up geometricaIIy.

24:13.211 --> 24:18.002
If you set them up geometricaIIy,
you're using the standard methods,

24:18.090 --> 24:21.292
it's a machine, it's an aIgorithm,
you appIy the ruIes.

24:21.384 --> 24:23.044
Why is that not cheating?

24:23.136 --> 24:25.673
-ExactIy.
-Strange, isn't it?

24:27.514 --> 24:31.891
So, the onIy Iegitimate way to make
a painting is to just waIk up to the canvas,

24:31.976 --> 24:34.549
and aIIa prima paint it.

24:34.645 --> 24:38.263
But the reason it isn't cheating
is that it's hard.

24:38.357 --> 24:40.598
-Yes.
-It's geometry, it's mathematics.

24:40.692 --> 24:43.895
-WeII, this certainIy is not easy.
-This is not easy, no.

24:43.986 --> 24:47.437
-If Vermeer did this, it wasn't a time saver.
-No, indeed.

24:47.531 --> 24:53.900
I can't comprehend that someone
couId paint that from their imagination.

24:55.162 --> 24:56.241
No. Of course not.

24:56.330 --> 24:59.117
A human being is pretty
remarkabIe sometimes.

24:59.208 --> 25:03.121
To get objects at their true sizes,

25:03.211 --> 25:08.168
and to get aII the kind of Iuminous effects...

25:08.257 --> 25:13.167
Painters can do miracuIous things,
it's difficuIt to say, ''This is impossibIe,''

25:13.261 --> 25:17.044
but some things are more impossibIe
than others.

25:30.108 --> 25:32.943
I was gonna go right off the edge there.

25:33.778 --> 25:34.857
So.

25:34.946 --> 25:38.480
-Great. WeII, congratuIations.
-And you.

25:38.574 --> 25:39.819
Fantastic.

25:42.661 --> 25:46.989
I want to think that
this simpIe, eIegant device

25:47.081 --> 25:50.200
is something that Vermeer couId have used.

25:50.292 --> 25:53.458
There's no doubt it's practicaI,
and it's simpIe.

25:53.545 --> 25:54.920
You know, it's a pIain mirror.

25:55.004 --> 25:57.839
This is a 1 7th-century technoIogy,
they knew aII about mirrors,

25:57.923 --> 26:01.921
and you can imagine him perhaps thinking
of something Iike what Tim has thought of,

26:02.010 --> 26:05.509
but we know nothing from
a documentary point of view

26:05.597 --> 26:08.383
of how Vermeer worked,
there are no descriptions by him,

26:08.474 --> 26:11.759
by other peopIe, there are no drawings...

26:11.852 --> 26:13.643
We know very IittIe about his Iife.

26:13.728 --> 26:18.935
So the onIy reaI source of information
to answer a question Iike that

26:19.024 --> 26:20.602
wouId be the paintings themseIves.

26:20.693 --> 26:23.361
Using Tim's device, it isn't easy,

26:23.445 --> 26:27.193
but somehow it does turn you
into a machine.

26:27.281 --> 26:30.448
You become a machine.
Was Vermeer a machine?

26:31.827 --> 26:35.776
Maybe Vermeer was strong-minded enough
to think, ''I'II become a machine''.

26:38.332 --> 26:39.874
That little picture of the jug

26:39.959 --> 26:43.659
took Tim and Steadman
eight and a half hours to paint,

26:43.754 --> 26:45.545
and Tim's method worked.

26:45.630 --> 26:49.378
But they were painting in black and white,
and using powerful electric light

26:49.467 --> 26:52.218
that wouldn't have been around
in Vermeer's day.

26:52.302 --> 26:55.718
Would Tim's mirror work well enough
to paint The Music Lesson,

26:55.805 --> 26:58.557
in full colour, in natural light?

26:58.641 --> 27:02.887
To find that out Tim would need
Vermeer's room, and everything in it.

27:03.478 --> 27:09.729
But museums don't loan stuff from the 1600s
to video engineers with a wacky hobby.

27:10.985 --> 27:14.733
It wouId be nice if I couId have hired
somebody to buiId aII this

27:14.821 --> 27:17.110
but it was kind of an interactive process,

27:17.198 --> 27:22.571
you know, I had to first modeI the room
in LightWave 3D,

27:23.829 --> 27:27.612
working from the painting to get
the dimensions and the shapes right.

27:27.707 --> 27:31.122
Even though it was a Iot of work,
it was just easier for me to do it,

27:31.210 --> 27:33.202
because as I went I couId make sure

27:33.295 --> 27:36.498
that the furniture Iooked Iike
the furniture in the Vermeers.

27:36.923 --> 27:39.295
But Tim is not a dressmaker.

27:39.717 --> 27:40.880
Or a framer.

27:41.510 --> 27:43.716
Or a carpenter. Upholsterer.

27:44.137 --> 27:45.217
Glazier.

27:46.056 --> 27:49.175
Builder of virginals,
which is a type of harpsichord.

27:49.517 --> 27:50.762
Metalsmith.

27:50.851 --> 27:52.132
Furniture maker.

27:52.228 --> 27:53.722
Plasterer.

27:53.854 --> 27:55.016
Tile layer.

27:55.105 --> 27:57.346
Or a lens maker.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.065
But he's not an artist either.

27:59.567 --> 28:02.733
He used what he was, a technologist,

28:02.820 --> 28:05.524
to help him become
all those things he wasn't,

28:05.614 --> 28:08.401
so that he could build his room.

28:48.567 --> 28:49.811
This is fun.

28:50.818 --> 28:56.737
I mean, this is the reaI thing.

29:45.072 --> 29:47.610
Is it safe for there to be that much smoke?

29:47.699 --> 29:50.190
I don't know, I've never done this before!

29:50.285 --> 29:52.610
CouId it heat up and catch fire?

29:52.704 --> 29:57.080
-WeII, I guess. I don't know.
-Whatever!

29:57.166 --> 29:59.621
It's kind of cooI. Okay, here we go.

30:27.399 --> 30:30.684
Okay, I got a probIem with the virginaIs Ieg.

30:30.777 --> 30:34.193
It's supposed to be 36 and a haIf inches Iong,

30:34.280 --> 30:38.692
but my Iathe onIy goes

30:39.701 --> 30:42.488
about 34 inches.

30:42.829 --> 30:45.367
I mean, I couId make the Ieg in two pieces.

30:45.456 --> 30:48.872
But I think what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to cut the Iathe in two.

31:00.636 --> 31:06.839
GeneraIIy, you don't take a fine
precision machine tooI and saw it in haIf,

31:07.266 --> 31:10.432
but power tooIs are made to be jury-rigged.

31:57.934 --> 31:59.392
Yeah, it's a big guitar.

32:02.437 --> 32:08.226
VioIa da gamba is caIIed a ''vioIa da gamba''
because ''gamba'' means Ieg,

32:08.693 --> 32:10.768
and you pIay it between your Iegs.

32:22.454 --> 32:23.569
I Iike it.

32:46.349 --> 32:48.342
I don't know much about woodworking.

32:50.478 --> 32:56.729
So I'm doing this, not out
of Iove for woodworking,

32:56.816 --> 32:58.441
but out of necessity

32:58.526 --> 33:04.694
because you just can't buy these
stupid chairs anywhere,

33:04.781 --> 33:06.275
and I need one.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.853
David Hockney is one
of Britain's greatest artists.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.560
He's famous for paintings like this.

34:36.650 --> 34:40.232
Since his optical theory got
Tim started on this journey,

34:40.320 --> 34:44.531
he seemed the ideal person for Tim to talk to.

34:44.614 --> 34:48.114
Hockney invited us to visit,
so we all went to England.

34:50.661 --> 34:56.248
What l knew about David Hockney
was that he was a famous artist.

34:56.333 --> 34:59.832
But, reading his book, l could see
that he wasn't a typical artist,

34:59.920 --> 35:03.169
that he was somewhat a scientist.

35:03.423 --> 35:07.883
PhiIip Steadman and David Hockney,
to my mind,

35:09.261 --> 35:11.633
to the mind of a sceptic,

35:11.721 --> 35:18.470
prove that Vermeer used some sort of device.

35:18.560 --> 35:24.313
But Secret Knowledge,
and aII the PhiIip Steadman work,

35:24.440 --> 35:30.442
are this wonderfuI, exciting, tingIy whodunit,
that never teIIs you who did it.

35:30.946 --> 35:33.863
Hockney showed
that artists were using lenses.

35:33.948 --> 35:36.569
Steadman argued that
Vermeer was using a lens.

35:36.659 --> 35:40.442
l believed that Vermeer must have
been using more than just a lens.

35:40.537 --> 35:44.451
The reason to go see Hockney was
to bounce this idea off him

35:44.540 --> 35:46.912
and see if he thought it was plausible.

35:47.293 --> 35:49.748
How did you figure this out?
What are you, a...

35:49.836 --> 35:52.753
WeII, I started thinking about it
after I read your book, and...

35:52.839 --> 35:54.796
Are you an opticaI... I mean...

35:54.882 --> 35:56.211
I design teIevision equipment.

35:56.300 --> 35:57.628
-That's my job.
-I see.

35:57.718 --> 36:01.762
So I know a bit about coIour and imagery.

36:01.847 --> 36:05.974
And I suspected Iooking at these
oId pictures from the GoIden Age,

36:06.058 --> 36:11.099
Caravaggio, Vermeer, van Eyck,

36:11.188 --> 36:16.561
that there must have been
a way to copy the tones.

36:16.692 --> 36:20.392
Because that's what's quite remarkabIe,
actuaIIy. Yes, it is.

36:20.487 --> 36:23.653
I need to stand on that side
of the tabIe for a second.

36:23.740 --> 36:27.073
So it's a mirror on a stick.

36:27.159 --> 36:28.190
AII right.

36:28.285 --> 36:32.993
This is what I saw when I was painting,
if you Iook straight down.

36:33.164 --> 36:35.370
And of course I started with a bIank...

36:35.458 --> 36:36.786
I see, yes. Yeah, yeah.

36:36.876 --> 36:41.087
And you can move your head up and down
and you can see different parts of the image.

36:41.171 --> 36:44.753
And that's how you work your way
from one part to the other.

36:44.841 --> 36:49.965
Now right at the edge of the mirror,
where you see both images,

36:50.054 --> 36:53.837
you can do a direct comparison of the tone.

36:53.932 --> 36:55.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:55.350 --> 36:58.054
And your eye can instantIy see,
because they're together,

36:58.144 --> 37:02.057
can see any contrast, and the edge
of the mirror basicaIIy disappears.

37:02.147 --> 37:06.014
When you have the right coIour
and onIy when you have the right coIour.

37:07.360 --> 37:11.108
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see.
This is very ingenious.

37:11.530 --> 37:15.361
So you notice that there is no paraIIax
when you move your head,

37:15.450 --> 37:16.529
there is no shifting.

37:16.618 --> 37:18.526
-That's it, no.
-The two images stay Iocked together.

37:18.619 --> 37:19.947
-Why is that?
-Want to Iook through it?

37:20.037 --> 37:22.113
-How is that?
-I know, it's very cIever.

37:22.206 --> 37:26.831
I must say, the idea that the ItaIians,
when you think about the ItaIians,

37:26.918 --> 37:31.413
they Iove pictures,
the idea that they didn't use this

37:31.505 --> 37:36.843
because this wouId have been cheating,
I find chiIdish, absoIuteIy chiIdish.

37:36.926 --> 37:41.054
There's aIso this modern idea that
art and technoIogy must never meet.

37:41.180 --> 37:44.963
You know, you go to schooI for technoIogy
or you go to schooI for art

37:45.058 --> 37:46.766
but never for both.

37:46.851 --> 37:49.768
But in the GoIden Age,
they were one and the same person.

37:49.854 --> 37:50.933
Yeah.

37:51.021 --> 37:54.306
The interesting thing is that
if this was around then,

37:54.816 --> 37:57.521
we are seeing photographs.

37:57.986 --> 38:02.362
If they were using this
and exactIy copying that coIour.

38:02.448 --> 38:04.819
Yeah, weII, I mean...

38:04.908 --> 38:08.193
-It's a photo.
-Yeah.

38:08.286 --> 38:14.157
After seeing this, I mean,
it's not a compIicated piece of equipment,

38:14.249 --> 38:19.041
but how IikeIy do you think it is
that they may have done this?

38:19.128 --> 38:21.251
-I think it's very IikeIy.
-ReaIIy.

38:21.338 --> 38:23.829
Very IikeIy. Yeah, yeah, absoIuteIy IikeIy.

38:23.924 --> 38:27.339
I mean, I'm pretty positive optics...

38:27.427 --> 38:30.593
I mean, there's no expIanation
for the paintings without optics.

38:33.098 --> 38:35.885
But, you know, historicaI evidence,

38:35.976 --> 38:41.016
it'd be great to find a Iost Ietter
from Johannes Vermeer...

38:41.105 --> 38:42.599
Wait a minute.

38:42.982 --> 38:45.519
I put a joke Ietter in Secret Knowledge.

38:45.609 --> 38:46.640
You did?

38:46.735 --> 38:48.015
A joke Ietter.

38:48.111 --> 38:52.986
This is what historians were Iooking for.
From Hugo van der Goes to van Eyck.

38:55.284 --> 39:00.360
''CouId you go to ye
Brugge Mirror SuppIy Company

39:00.455 --> 39:05.246
''and get one of those makeup mirrors
for my wife, you know what I mean?''

39:06.877 --> 39:09.083
WeII, I said,
''You'II never find a Ietter Iike that.''

39:09.170 --> 39:10.830
-Yeah.
-They never wrote down...

39:10.922 --> 39:15.133
Van Eyck wouId not write down
the formuIas for the paint

39:16.176 --> 39:18.927
for the simpIe reason
that somebody might read them.

39:19.012 --> 39:20.506
And there were other peopIe

39:20.597 --> 39:22.221
that wouIdn't write 'em down.

39:22.306 --> 39:27.548
PeopIe were sworn to secrecy,
oaths that they took very seriousIy.

39:28.145 --> 39:31.513
You won't, you never...
It's naive to think you'II find something.

39:31.606 --> 39:34.939
Paintings are documents, aren't they?
Aren't they teIIing you a Iot?

39:36.777 --> 39:38.401
Paintings are documents.

39:38.487 --> 39:40.894
They contain the story of their own creation.

39:40.989 --> 39:44.024
Every brushstroke, every layer of colour,
every shadow

39:44.116 --> 39:46.868
represents another piece of information.

39:47.119 --> 39:51.745
To the trained eye, a painting can be read
as accurately as any written text.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.867
And you don't need a trained eye

39:53.958 --> 39:57.457
to see that Vermeer's look different
from his contemporaries.

39:57.544 --> 40:00.035
They look like video images.

40:00.130 --> 40:02.501
He painted the way a camera sees.

40:05.134 --> 40:06.877
Ever since photography was invented,

40:06.969 --> 40:10.218
people have been noticing optical things
about Vermeer.

40:10.305 --> 40:11.633
On the GirI with the Red Hat,

40:11.723 --> 40:14.807
there's this lion's head
in the foreground that's fuzzy.

40:14.892 --> 40:17.679
Your eye naturally refocuses
on whatever you're looking at,

40:17.769 --> 40:19.228
so something in the foreground

40:19.312 --> 40:22.147
is not going to appear to your eye
as out of focus.

40:22.232 --> 40:26.478
But it could be out of focus
if the image was projected with a lens.

40:27.319 --> 40:29.027
The so-called pointilles,

40:29.112 --> 40:34.984
these little circles of paint,
look similar to what you get in a bad lens.

40:35.659 --> 40:40.202
You look at the back of her jacket
and there's a faint blue line.

40:40.288 --> 40:46.491
And that looks a lot like chromatic aberration
which is what happens in a crude lens.

40:47.378 --> 40:51.161
The edges of objects can develop
this rainbow fringe around them.

40:51.965 --> 40:56.092
This faIIoff of Iight from the window
to the opposite corner

40:56.177 --> 40:59.960
is something that an artist reaIIy cannot see
the way a camera sees it.

41:00.055 --> 41:01.597
It's impossibIe to see it.

41:01.681 --> 41:05.263
But Vermeer painted it
the way a camera sees it.

41:05.768 --> 41:10.595
Is it possibIe that
some peopIe can see absoIute brightness,

41:10.689 --> 41:12.349
and most peopIe, can't?

41:12.440 --> 41:15.013
You know, the way a musician
might have perfect pitch?

41:16.027 --> 41:19.477
You know, that's a question for a doctor.

41:19.738 --> 41:23.023
I'm CoIin BIakemore.
I'm a professor at Oxford.

41:23.241 --> 41:25.814
Or a scientist
that speciaIises in human vision.

41:25.910 --> 41:31.200
And I've spent most of my career studying
vision and the functions of the brain.

41:31.373 --> 41:33.863
Is Vermeer maybe some sort of a savant

41:33.958 --> 41:36.034
that's different
from the rest of the human race?

41:36.127 --> 41:38.249
What if someone said,

41:38.337 --> 41:43.876
''Maybe there's a savant who is so smart,
that he couId figure that out.''

41:43.967 --> 41:47.051
WeII, he's not smart. I mean,
he'd have to have a very strange retina.

41:47.178 --> 41:49.217
Our retinas are made the way they're made.

41:49.430 --> 41:51.837
The retina is an outgrowth of the brain.

41:51.932 --> 41:55.929
It's a very compIicated structure
in terms of its nervous organisation.

41:56.019 --> 41:58.426
The signaIs go through
a compIicated network,

41:58.521 --> 42:01.806
severaI Iayers
of different types of nerve ceIIs,

42:01.898 --> 42:05.646
before they finaIIy get back
to the Iast ceIIs in the chain

42:05.735 --> 42:08.308
whose fibres make up the optic nerve.

42:08.612 --> 42:14.033
The optic nerve has limited bandwidth,
so the signals have to be compressed.

42:14.117 --> 42:16.405
One thing we lose in that compression

42:16.494 --> 42:21.202
is the ability to record absolute brightness
the way a light metre can.

42:23.125 --> 42:27.667
When we see two values side by side,
it's easy to compare them.

42:28.212 --> 42:31.663
But when we split them,
that ability goes away.

42:33.425 --> 42:37.636
There just isn't any mechanism
in the human nervous system

42:38.221 --> 42:41.506
to turn the eye into a Iight metre.

42:41.807 --> 42:44.344
And this is a very cIever trick
for reducing information,

42:44.434 --> 42:48.348
but it's a disaster if you reaIIy want to know
about the appearance of the scene

42:48.437 --> 42:50.928
because you just can't do it with your brain.

42:51.732 --> 42:55.396
Look at the light on the back wall
of The Music Lesson.

42:55.485 --> 43:00.858
Every subtlety of brightness is recorded
with absolute photographic precision.

43:01.949 --> 43:05.115
The unaided human eye
is not equipped to do that.

43:05.493 --> 43:09.028
But if Vermeer used something
like Tim's device,

43:09.121 --> 43:11.328
the painting becomes possible.

43:12.291 --> 43:14.960
The Queen of England
owns Vermeer's Music Lesson

43:15.043 --> 43:17.166
and she has it there in Buckingham Palace.

43:17.253 --> 43:21.961
We thought since we were in England,
we'd stop by the palace and check it out.

43:22.383 --> 43:26.629
But the Queen said no.
So we shot a whole tirade against the Queen.

43:35.602 --> 43:36.633
But then...

43:36.728 --> 43:39.432
WeII, I just came out of that buiIding.

43:40.231 --> 43:42.307
That's where the painting is,
Buckingham PaIace.

43:42.399 --> 43:46.977
The day before Tim returned home,
the Queen changed her Royal mind.

43:47.529 --> 43:51.395
She granted Tim a private audience
with The Music Lesson.

43:51.824 --> 43:54.445
He had 30 minutes to study the painting.

43:54.535 --> 43:58.579
The deal was, he could only record
the experience in his head,

43:58.663 --> 44:00.572
no photography allowed.

44:00.665 --> 44:02.823
And it was a great 30 minutes.

44:04.460 --> 44:06.416
The painting is amazing.

44:06.920 --> 44:10.004
It's very different than I thought it wouId be.

44:10.339 --> 44:13.506
The reproductions
don't do it any justice at aII.

44:14.760 --> 44:16.088
The coIours are more muted.

44:16.178 --> 44:20.175
It's sIightIy darker,
it's got a kind of an overaII bIuish cast.

44:23.309 --> 44:27.092
But the astounding thing
is the amount of detaiI.

44:27.312 --> 44:29.684
I put on my magnifying binocuIars

44:30.815 --> 44:35.108
and Iooked at the virginaIs, and every stroke

44:35.569 --> 44:38.107
of that decoration is there.

44:39.197 --> 44:42.114
The Persian carpet,
you can see the individuaI knots.

44:44.243 --> 44:50.280
The amount of devotion, or dedication,
or obsession

44:50.999 --> 44:53.205
to get that amount of detaiI

44:53.292 --> 44:56.542
that just makes a generaI impression
on the viewer,

44:57.879 --> 45:02.587
but must have taken months of hard work.

45:06.595 --> 45:09.216
I don't know if I can even come cIose.

45:11.432 --> 45:15.382
When Tim got back to San Antonio,
he was in trouble.

45:19.064 --> 45:21.056
When he looked directly at the virginals,

45:21.149 --> 45:26.273
he could see the intricate pattern of
interlocking seahorses that Vermeer painted.

45:28.405 --> 45:31.109
When he looked at the projection
in his camera obscura,

45:31.199 --> 45:35.362
all those delicate little lines were too fuzzy
and dim to paint.

45:36.036 --> 45:37.614
lt was a deal-killer.

45:37.704 --> 45:40.277
l had visions of a failed experiment.

45:40.915 --> 45:43.240
Tim knew there was something
he was missing.

45:44.252 --> 45:49.458
He experimented with increasingly
complex arrangements of lenses and mirrors.

45:49.798 --> 45:51.458
But nothing worked.

45:51.674 --> 45:53.963
Then Tim had an inspiration.

45:54.552 --> 45:58.798
He held a mirror against the wall
where the image was being projected.

45:59.806 --> 46:03.850
Now he could see a small circle of the room
sharp and clear

46:03.935 --> 46:06.260
and hundreds of times brighter.

46:06.896 --> 46:11.936
By tilting the mirror around, he could see
any part of the room he needed to paint.

46:12.942 --> 46:17.568
Then he realised if he just replaced
the flat mirror with a concave mirror,

46:17.655 --> 46:19.647
like a shaving mirror,

46:19.740 --> 46:23.606
he could make the bright circle much larger.

46:24.619 --> 46:27.572
So I reaIised
that if I couId have an image that bright,

46:27.663 --> 46:29.371
I didn't have to have this darkroom,

46:29.456 --> 46:34.082
I couId paint in dayIight,
which is a huge, huge breakthrough.

46:34.919 --> 46:37.125
Tim started in the dark room.

46:37.254 --> 46:38.997
But the room is gone.

46:39.089 --> 46:41.496
The back wall is a concave mirror.

46:41.675 --> 46:45.672
All that's left
of the traditional camera obscura is the lens.

46:50.599 --> 46:56.553
Tim had invented a new optical instrument
or, perhaps, rediscovered a lost one.

46:57.188 --> 47:01.600
ln it, he could see well enough
to attempt Vermeer's level of detail.

47:02.817 --> 47:05.688
He had his room. He had his machine.

47:05.778 --> 47:08.020
He was now ready to paint.

48:00.407 --> 48:01.652
Oh, boy.

48:38.022 --> 48:40.643
Boy, you know, I'm not trying
to make this Iook Iike a Vermeer,

48:40.733 --> 48:42.393
but it reaIIy Iooks Iike a Vermeer.

49:08.423 --> 49:13.131
I was cIeaning up,
and getting ready to put my paIette away,

49:13.218 --> 49:16.753
caII it a day's work,
and I Iooked up at the monitor.

49:19.015 --> 49:24.353
I thought, ''Man, that camera got pointed in
the wrong direction, it's pointed at the room.

49:24.436 --> 49:25.895
''How did that happen?''

49:25.979 --> 49:29.928
And that's the thought that went through
my head for just a coupIe miIIiseconds

49:30.024 --> 49:33.309
before I reaIised,
''No, I'm Iooking at the painting.''

49:34.278 --> 49:36.353
And it was just kind of Iike a...

50:21.484 --> 50:25.315
You know, this project
is a Iot Iike watching paint dry.

51:17.823 --> 51:20.859
l can paint the costumes
by putting them on mannequins.

51:20.951 --> 51:24.200
But to paint faces and hands,
l need to use people.

51:26.872 --> 51:29.541
l do everything l can to help them hold still.

51:30.792 --> 51:32.416
lt sort of works.

51:36.213 --> 51:38.834
My daughter CIaire is home for a month
from coIIege.

51:39.174 --> 51:41.250
And it's time to paint the girl,

51:41.468 --> 51:45.299
so I put two and two together,
and used CIaire.

51:45.388 --> 51:48.637
Her two sisters, are also in town,
Luren and Natalie.

51:48.724 --> 51:52.673
So they worked on fitting the costume
and doing her hair

51:52.769 --> 51:55.722
so that it looks like the girl in the picture.

51:55.813 --> 52:00.309
When they got aII that on,
she was a dead ringer for the IittIe Dutch girI.

52:00.567 --> 52:04.232
With that completed,
we put her in the head clamp,

52:05.738 --> 52:07.814
and positioned her just right.

52:45.688 --> 52:49.270
Few students have ever been happier
to go back to school.

53:01.243 --> 53:02.951
I may repaint that.

53:08.249 --> 53:11.415
Excuse me a second.
The wind's trying to bIow my shade down.

53:11.502 --> 53:14.502
l thought you were having a ghost visitation.

53:27.890 --> 53:29.088
Fucker!

53:34.104 --> 53:35.598
Piece of shit.

53:37.982 --> 53:39.725
We're gonna have to go to pIan B here.

53:39.817 --> 53:44.644
The frame that has my window,
and my shades and stuff, it came Ioose

53:44.738 --> 53:47.857
and it feII over and I think everything's okay.

53:51.285 --> 53:52.316
AII right.

53:52.411 --> 53:56.242
I tend to buiId things
untiI they're just bareIy good enough.

53:56.790 --> 53:59.825
And sometimes that enveIope gets exceeded.

54:00.710 --> 54:05.335
So if anything falls askew,
your painting's in no danger, is that correct?

54:05.964 --> 54:07.956
No, I wouIdn't say that.

54:08.341 --> 54:10.547
-Okay.
-But, you know, I can aIways start over.

54:59.342 --> 55:01.548
Another interesting thing happened.

55:01.636 --> 55:03.628
What I noticed whiIe I was Iooking at this,

55:03.721 --> 55:07.634
I can see the straight Iines
of the seahorse there,

55:07.724 --> 55:12.848
and I can see the straight Iines
that I've ruIed aIready on the canvas,

55:12.937 --> 55:16.388
the framework of the virginaIs.

55:16.898 --> 55:20.730
AII those are perfectIy straight Iines
because I Iaid 'em out with a straight edge

55:20.818 --> 55:22.478
before I painted them.

55:22.570 --> 55:28.323
WeII, when I am trying to aIign this
very cIose now, within a tiny fraction,

55:28.408 --> 55:33.568
I can see that this straight Iine
isn't quite straight

55:34.371 --> 55:35.534
in the refIection.

55:35.622 --> 55:37.828
It's ever so sIightIy curved.

55:38.959 --> 55:43.169
ProbabIy not enough to throw me off
now that I'm aware of it,

55:43.254 --> 55:47.251
but if I had just IiteraIIy painted
that seahorse pattern,

55:47.924 --> 55:50.629
it wouId have ended up curved Iike this.

55:52.595 --> 55:58.430
And, so, I don't know why, but I went over
and I picked up the Vermeer print.

56:00.727 --> 56:05.969
And I go,
''WeII, obviousIy Vermeer had no troubIe

56:07.149 --> 56:09.474
''painting those Iines straight.''

56:12.320 --> 56:15.273
And then, I heId the painting sideways
Iike this

56:15.364 --> 56:18.199
and I'm Iooking down these straight Iines.

56:23.121 --> 56:25.576
And there's something reaIIy crazy
about this.

56:25.748 --> 56:29.827
The top and the bottom of the virginaIs
are absoIuteIy straight.

56:29.918 --> 56:33.002
Because when I Iook at it down here
at an angIe,

56:33.921 --> 56:36.459
I can see that it's a straight Iine.

56:37.299 --> 56:39.505
The seahorse motif is curved.

56:42.011 --> 56:43.671
It goes Iike this.

56:44.639 --> 56:48.089
You can't reaIIy teII untiI you Iook at it

56:49.434 --> 56:51.640
right down those Iines, but...

56:55.439 --> 56:56.684
There is a curvature in there.

56:56.774 --> 56:59.940
And there's reaIIy no IogicaI expIanation
for that

57:01.278 --> 57:04.029
unIess he was using something Iike this.

57:06.449 --> 57:10.944
Tim caIIs that bend in the seahorse pattern
the ''seahorse smiIe.''

57:11.369 --> 57:14.204
It's a fIaw in Vermeer's painting.

57:14.289 --> 57:20.160
A mistake that nobody noticed for 350 years,
and then Tim aImost made the same mistake.

57:20.252 --> 57:26.170
Tim is not Iooking for something
that wiII dupIicate Vermeer's mistake.

57:26.966 --> 57:29.883
You know,
he doesn't know Vermeer's mistake is there.

57:29.968 --> 57:33.135
That's either a remarkabIe coincidence

57:33.221 --> 57:38.013
or Vermeer was using Tim's machine,
or something very much Iike Tim's machine

57:38.100 --> 57:39.215
to do his painting.

57:39.310 --> 57:42.808
As Hockney said, paintings are documents,

57:42.896 --> 57:44.972
and here's a IittIe bit of evidence.

58:39.527 --> 58:42.397
Today I painted the seahorse motif.

58:42.488 --> 58:47.113
It was a Iot of work. I couIdn't reaIIy sit here
for more than 15, 20 minutes at a time.

58:47.575 --> 58:50.113
Your back just gets extremeIy tense.

58:50.369 --> 58:56.869
I tried to sit in the most reIaxed position
I couId find, which is Iike this.

58:58.376 --> 59:03.452
It's just reaIIy nerve-wracking, meticuIous,
demanding work.

59:03.547 --> 59:07.129
I'm not Iooking forward
to doing the rest of the instrument,

59:07.217 --> 59:09.090
but at Ieast I know it's doabIe.

01:00:10.478 --> 01:00:14.427
What I painted today is maybe, I expect

01:00:14.523 --> 01:00:19.480
wiII turn out to be the hardest part
of the painting, physicaIIy, to do.

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.859
Man.

01:02:21.171 --> 01:02:25.547
WeII, yeah this is going to be short
because it's about 40 degrees in here.

01:02:25.633 --> 01:02:30.709
So KarI and I came in here this morning,
and Iooked at each other, Iike,

01:02:32.555 --> 01:02:35.556
''No.'' You know, it's reaIIy coId in here.

01:02:35.975 --> 01:02:41.313
So I go, ''Wait, I've got this heater
in the garage that I never assembIed.

01:02:41.396 --> 01:02:45.892
''I got it for Christmas a few years ago,
it's one of those patio heaters.''

01:02:48.027 --> 01:02:51.727
So, KarI said,
''Hey, I'II put it together, Iet's go get it.''

01:02:52.405 --> 01:02:55.489
So we went and got it, and put it together,
it's over there.

01:02:55.575 --> 01:02:59.738
And fired it up and it worked great.
It's nice and toasty, you know?

01:03:00.287 --> 01:03:02.860
KarI was sittin' over there with his computer,

01:03:02.956 --> 01:03:09.124
and I said, ''Hey, Iook up on there
to see if it's safe to use these indoors.''

01:03:12.464 --> 01:03:14.124
And KarI Iooks up and says,

01:03:14.215 --> 01:03:18.212
''Yeah, you know it says here
it's absoIuteIy not safe to use indoors.''

01:03:19.261 --> 01:03:23.093
And I said, ''Okay. WeII, Iet's just run it

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:27.094
''and we'II be carefuI, okay?

01:03:27.185 --> 01:03:33.352
''So if we notice any symptoms
of carbon monoxide poisoning, you know,

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.562
''we'II shut it off.''

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:40.940
So I start painting, and I actuaIIy painted
an eIephant on The Music Lesson.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:45.860
I don't know why I put it there,
but it seemed Iike a good idea at the time.

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:49.947
KarI actuaIIy, he put his head down,

01:03:51.538 --> 01:03:53.614
and he said, ''I need a nap.''

01:03:53.707 --> 01:03:56.280
I said, ''What did you say?''
He said, ''I need a nap.''

01:03:56.376 --> 01:04:00.539
I said, ''Okay, Iet's Ieave right now.''

01:04:01.964 --> 01:04:04.122
''Let's shut this thing off and go get Iunch.''

01:04:04.216 --> 01:04:06.753
And on the way to Iunch, driving to Iunch,

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:09.879
everything sort of cIeared up again,
you know, we were in a fog.

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.346
So anyway, that was a bad idea.

01:04:57.802 --> 01:04:59.711
It was kind of a weird day.

01:05:01.347 --> 01:05:04.550
I came in and started painting
this Iower cushion,

01:05:04.641 --> 01:05:08.425
and sort of a wave of revulsion
swept over me.

01:05:10.771 --> 01:05:15.516
l just wanted to do anything in the world
but sit here and paint for some reason.

01:05:17.193 --> 01:05:19.601
I don't know, just one of those things.

01:05:20.446 --> 01:05:24.230
But I am pretty much ready
for this painting to be finished.

01:05:26.368 --> 01:05:28.277
If we weren't making a fiIm, wouId I quit?

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:32.497
Yeah, I definiteIy wouId. Yeah.
I'd find something eIse to do right now.

01:05:36.793 --> 01:05:40.921
WeII, yesterday
when I was painting this chair, I was aImost

01:05:44.216 --> 01:05:45.461
repuIsed by it.

01:05:45.551 --> 01:05:49.761
I think maybe subconsciousIy
I knew that it was wrong.

01:05:52.765 --> 01:05:57.510
And it just didn't Iook Iike
it beIonged in the painting to me,

01:05:57.602 --> 01:06:00.603
and I couIdn't
put my finger on the reason why.

01:06:01.397 --> 01:06:04.979
And as I was trying to get to sIeep Iast night,

01:06:05.067 --> 01:06:08.685
I was just sort of Iaying there
and I was visuaIizing that chair

01:06:08.778 --> 01:06:11.186
and I couId see it in my mind.

01:06:11.281 --> 01:06:14.447
And I go,
''You know, that's just the wrong bIue.

01:06:15.909 --> 01:06:18.151
''l should darken the legs. ''

01:06:19.579 --> 01:06:22.496
The top of the chair
can't possibly be tilted to the left.

01:06:22.582 --> 01:06:26.116
lt's like l'm seeing it
and that can't possibly be right.

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:29.495
l realised that
l had bumped the lens out of position

01:06:29.588 --> 01:06:32.671
and that's why
the chair's perspective was wrong.

01:06:33.299 --> 01:06:35.172
It was totaIIy a subconscious thing.

01:06:35.259 --> 01:06:41.131
Maybe I do have an inner artist
that knew that was wrong.

01:07:29.429 --> 01:07:34.256
I thought that the rug wouId be
a IittIe more free-form painting.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:39.011
But this rug is cIose enough
to the opticaI equipment here

01:07:39.104 --> 01:07:42.686
that l can clearly see all those little stitches.

01:07:42.774 --> 01:07:47.898
And since I can see that, and since my ruIe
is ''paint what you see in the mirror,''

01:07:47.987 --> 01:07:50.275
if I want to get that kind of detaiI,

01:07:50.364 --> 01:07:55.488
I'm gonna have to
sort of make Iike the harpsichord here

01:07:56.327 --> 01:07:58.284
and just go for the detaiI.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:30.100
So, another day, more dots.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.350
Ditto yesterday.

01:08:31.857 --> 01:08:33.232
Just painting more dots.

01:09:29.488 --> 01:09:33.153
You know, it gets oId painting this carpet.

01:10:03.976 --> 01:10:05.351
Oh, my God.

01:10:12.733 --> 01:10:13.978
We're on.

01:10:15.902 --> 01:10:19.271
Okay, so I've been
franticaIIy running around here,

01:10:21.115 --> 01:10:22.775
setting up Iights.

01:10:27.078 --> 01:10:28.537
And it shows.

01:10:30.581 --> 01:10:33.747
Today is the denouement, of sorts.

01:10:34.543 --> 01:10:35.788
The varnish job.

01:10:36.044 --> 01:10:40.670
For the last several months
l've been promising myself

01:10:40.756 --> 01:10:43.461
that all would be better
when the varnish went on.

01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:49.006
Because as the paint dries,
it gets light, it gets chalky, it desaturates.

01:10:49.097 --> 01:10:51.504
l've been very anxious to do this.

01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:58.974
l went along slowly with a small brush
and finally l just grabbed a giant brush,

01:10:59.647 --> 01:11:03.230
sloshed it in the varnish
and just started going to town.

01:11:03.484 --> 01:11:06.650
And everywhere l touched was magic.

01:11:09.322 --> 01:11:11.149
lt's pretty astounding.

01:11:20.456 --> 01:11:22.413
WeII, you know, today...

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.001
Today's the day I've been waiting for.

01:11:42.308 --> 01:11:43.636
I'm sorry.

01:11:52.483 --> 01:11:54.523
I can't beIieve it's finished.

01:11:58.697 --> 01:12:02.694
We took Tim's painting back to England
to show Hockney and Steadman.

01:12:05.661 --> 01:12:07.238
WeII, that's it.

01:12:14.585 --> 01:12:20.836
So, you know, it's my first ambitious attempt
at oiI painting,

01:12:22.383 --> 01:12:25.586
and that's kind of part of the experiment,
that I'm not a painter,

01:12:25.678 --> 01:12:28.251
but I was trying to show
the power of the concept.

01:12:28.347 --> 01:12:29.426
Yeah.

01:12:30.891 --> 01:12:33.049
This is terrific, I must say.

01:12:33.268 --> 01:12:39.103
We noticed this
when we were doing our Iens experiments.

01:12:39.439 --> 01:12:44.231
We noticed
that especiaIIy on these kind of cIoths,

01:12:44.735 --> 01:12:48.400
on the projection you saw every weave

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:52.106
that you couIdn't in the reaI one,
and you get that in Vermeer.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.738
Now that's very, very effective.
Anybody Iooking at this...

01:12:54.827 --> 01:12:57.579
-I think this is better than Vermeer.
-Better than Vermeer?

01:12:57.663 --> 01:13:01.114
You do feeI the weave of the carpet.

01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:02.618
Yeah, you reaIIy do.

01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:04.417
It Iooks actuaIIy wooIIy, doesn't it?

01:13:04.502 --> 01:13:06.044
Amazing, actuaIIy.

01:13:07.671 --> 01:13:10.376
It had to be something simiIar, it had to be.

01:13:10.716 --> 01:13:13.633
I mean, there's no doubt
that you've proved one thing, Tim,

01:13:13.718 --> 01:13:18.878
that you can paint a painting
of this degree of detaiI and precision in...

01:13:18.973 --> 01:13:22.804
WeII, it's not exactIy a camera obscura,
but it's an opticaI machine.

01:13:22.892 --> 01:13:26.557
And that's reaIIy what I set out to prove,
is that it couId have been done that way.

01:13:26.646 --> 01:13:28.104
Sure. I mean there's no doubt about that.

01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:30.311
There's no way
that it proves that Vermeer did.

01:13:30.399 --> 01:13:34.396
That's the second question obviousIy, yes.
Did Vermeer work that way?

01:13:34.486 --> 01:13:38.814
Yeah, but it makes you rather convinced
that's what he did.

01:13:38.906 --> 01:13:42.072
I'm getting a IittIe more convinced
aII the time.

01:13:42.242 --> 01:13:44.863
I wouId say I'm about 90% there.

01:13:45.411 --> 01:13:50.653
But, you know,
if there was some historicaI record...

01:13:50.749 --> 01:13:54.793
I mean, the idea
that a painting isn't a historicaI record

01:13:54.878 --> 01:14:00.215
is from Iiterary peopIe who seem to just
not Iook at pictures and just read texts.

01:14:00.424 --> 01:14:02.250
This is a document in itseIf.

01:14:02.342 --> 01:14:05.212
I know peopIe are going on
about documents.

01:14:05.303 --> 01:14:08.506
Paintings and drawings are documents,
they teII you a great deaI.

01:14:08.597 --> 01:14:11.930
You've made a document
that's proving something, it is.

01:14:12.017 --> 01:14:14.175
It's fascinating.

01:14:14.686 --> 01:14:17.437
I mean, you set out to do some research.

01:14:17.647 --> 01:14:22.806
I think you've succeeded and, weII,
you've shown it's possibIe to do it.

01:14:23.985 --> 01:14:27.484
-As I say, if you've recorded it very weII...
-Yeah, yeah.

01:14:27.572 --> 01:14:29.979
I think it might disturb quite a Iot of peopIe.

01:14:30.074 --> 01:14:32.944
-I certainIy hope so.
-Which is fine, that's fine. Why not?

01:14:51.383 --> 01:14:53.708
My friend Tim painted a Vermeer.

01:14:54.386 --> 01:14:57.552
ln a warehouse, in San Antonio.

01:14:57.639 --> 01:14:59.465
He painted a Vermeer.

01:15:00.933 --> 01:15:03.850
And is Tim an artist, or is Tim an inventor?

01:15:04.061 --> 01:15:07.892
l think the problem is not trying
to pick one of those two for Tim to be,

01:15:07.981 --> 01:15:11.147
but the problem is
that we have that distinction.

01:15:12.359 --> 01:15:17.186
What Tim has done
is given us an image of Vermeer

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:23.993
as a man who is much more real,
and in that way much more amazing.

01:15:25.662 --> 01:15:29.991
l mean, unfathomable genius
doesn't really mean anything.

01:15:30.666 --> 01:15:32.824
Now he's a fathomable genius.

01:15:44.011 --> 01:15:48.672
lf there's any great merit in this picture
as a work of art, it's Vermeer's.

01:15:49.515 --> 01:15:54.224
lt's Vermeer's composition
and it's Vermeer's invention.

01:15:54.686 --> 01:15:58.434
lt's just been forgotten for 350 years.
