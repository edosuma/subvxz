WEBVTT

00:05.090 --> 00:08.259
So my mum is alive and she lives here.

00:08.718 --> 00:10.470
Why didn't you tell me sooner, man?

00:10.595 --> 00:15.683
I'd already told you that you died,
and that I had tortured you for centuries

00:15.809 --> 00:18.144
and that you're doomed
to be tortured again...

00:18.269 --> 00:20.647
I just didn't want to be, like, a bummer.

00:21.189 --> 00:25.276
But now you know everything important
about your life, I promise.

00:25.610 --> 00:28.404
A police officer came to my home

00:28.488 --> 00:31.658
and told me that my mum had been
accidentally trampled to death

00:31.699 --> 00:35.036
when she bent down to adjust her toe ring
at a Rascal Flatts concert.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.288
That police officer was an actor.

00:37.372 --> 00:40.625
See, about a month before,
your mum had gotten drunk

00:40.959 --> 00:44.629
wandered into a charity auction,
and bid $30,000

00:44.671 --> 00:46.172
for a date with Gene Simmons

00:46.631 --> 00:50.510
outbidding everyone
else by $29,800 dollars.

00:50.593 --> 00:54.097
She didn't want to pay,
so she faked her death

00:54.180 --> 00:57.475
moved to Nevada, and reinvented herself
as Diana Tremaine.

00:57.934 --> 01:00.937
Diana Tremaine is <i>my</i> fake ID name!

01:01.271 --> 01:03.815
How dare she steal the identity I stole!

01:04.023 --> 01:07.193
Look, I know this is a lot to take in,
but we're here to help your mum

01:07.235 --> 01:09.195
get into the Good Place.

01:09.237 --> 01:12.782
Whatever you're feeling, remember,
this is not about you.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.826
Right.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.203
How could you do this to me?

01:24.294 --> 01:26.462
Yay! You found me!

01:26.588 --> 01:27.922
What the hell, Mum?

01:28.006 --> 01:32.510
OK, baby, I can explain everything.
Let's all just take a breath.

01:32.677 --> 01:37.557
You haven't even introduced me
to this stretched-out, sexy Alex Trebek.

01:37.682 --> 01:39.601
I'm Michael. It's nice to meet you, Donna.

01:39.684 --> 01:42.520
Oh, uh, it's Diana now, for...

01:42.812 --> 01:44.397
You know, police reasons.

01:44.439 --> 01:47.650
- By the way, whose McMansion is this?
- My boyfriend Dave's.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.236
He's kind of a dork, but real sweet.

01:50.445 --> 01:55.992
And so fancy - his napkins are made out of,
like, shirt material.

01:56.075 --> 01:56.993
Cloth.

01:57.577 --> 02:00.872
OK. Now this is making sense.

02:01.164 --> 02:05.460
You change your name, bag a rich loser
with a tacky house. I get it.

02:06.002 --> 02:07.545
- You're running a scam.
- No, baby.

02:07.587 --> 02:11.216
This is as real as the nails
under my acrylic nails.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.593
- I'm a different person!
- Spare me.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.512
You will always be sun-baked Arizona trash

02:16.596 --> 02:19.849
and I know that because I grew up
baking right beside you!

02:19.933 --> 02:22.143
Oh, jeez! I didn't know we had company!

02:22.227 --> 02:23.436
Hey. Hi, I'm Dave.

02:23.519 --> 02:24.812
- Michael.
- Of course you're Dave.

02:24.896 --> 02:28.483
Hey, Dave. You and I need to have
a little conversation.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.276
- Diana!
- Oh, hey!

02:30.652 --> 02:31.819
Who the hell is this chick?

02:31.861 --> 02:33.488
Oh, this is my little potato pie, Patricia!

02:33.905 --> 02:35.865
And who might you be, by the way?

02:36.324 --> 02:38.576
Eleanor is my sorority sister.

02:38.701 --> 02:41.371
Right. Good ol' Kappa Zeta...

02:41.704 --> 02:42.622
Jones.

02:42.914 --> 02:44.040
- Oh.
- Hey...

02:44.958 --> 02:47.710
I can't believe I have to wait
in line to see my own sister.

02:47.794 --> 02:52.048
I have never waited in any kind of
formation before, let alone a line.

02:52.173 --> 02:55.885
- Wow, is this whole room just her work?
- Don't be fooled, Chidi.

02:55.969 --> 02:57.387
Kamilah is a charlatan.

02:57.512 --> 03:00.765
All she has to do is paint some dumb shapes
and people go mad.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.309
Those aren't dumb shapes.
They're a pair of boobs.

03:03.434 --> 03:05.061
And then two extra side boobs.

03:05.186 --> 03:09.816
It symbolises that boobs come in all shapes
and sizes, and distances apart.

03:09.941 --> 03:13.903
Ugh. Maybe we should just go, there are
plenty of other people I could help.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.531
Like my good friend Ben Affleck,
and his crippling addiction to back tattoos

03:16.572 --> 03:18.157
or my other good friend Matt Damon

03:18.199 --> 03:20.201
and his crippling addiction
to my friend Ben Affleck.

03:20.285 --> 03:21.744
It's important that you make amends.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.455
Your competitive relationship with Kamilah
is largely the reason

03:24.497 --> 03:26.082
that you didn't get into the Good Place.

03:26.291 --> 03:28.626
Stands to reason that the same
would be true for her.

03:28.710 --> 03:29.627
Fine.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.337
But the waiting is over.

03:31.546 --> 03:33.339
Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me!

03:35.091 --> 03:38.094
Tahani! Were you waiting
in a line to see me?

03:38.177 --> 03:39.554
That's hilarious.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.932
As a frog stares up in awe at the treetops

03:43.016 --> 03:46.311
so too does humanity gawk at the purity
of a blinding truth.

03:46.769 --> 03:48.354
Napkins and forks are in the back.

03:48.730 --> 03:51.024
So making omelettes is art now, is it?

03:51.107 --> 03:53.276
Not that I'd expect you to understand

03:53.359 --> 03:56.863
but it's a commentary on the world's
fascination with subservience, consumption

03:56.946 --> 03:58.906
death, and pedagogy.

03:59.532 --> 04:00.450
Cheddar or Swiss?

04:00.491 --> 04:02.952
Oh, no, I don't want an omelette.
I just came for a quick sisterly chat.

04:04.329 --> 04:07.582
My sister, Tahani,
refuses to order an omelette.

04:07.749 --> 04:10.251
As a result, the exhibit is now over

04:10.376 --> 04:12.837
and will never be shown again.
There will be no refunds.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.601
Hey now! I just checked my Apple Watch

04:26.684 --> 04:28.770
and it's "Marg-o-clock!"

04:30.271 --> 04:32.482
- So, Michael, what do you do?
- Ah.

04:32.565 --> 04:34.692
Well, um... I'm an architect.

04:34.734 --> 04:36.069
Get outta here! Me too!

04:36.319 --> 04:37.945
- Huh!
- Dave's real good.

04:38.029 --> 04:40.406
You should see the new Hooters on I-15.

04:40.490 --> 04:42.950
It looks classy, like a bank.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.370
So, how did you two love-rats meet?

04:45.453 --> 04:46.954
Oh, it's a fun story.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.459
I was working on this project, tearing down
a condemned bar called The Desert Rash.

04:51.584 --> 04:54.420
I went in to meet with the contractors,
and Diana is sitting at the bar

04:54.462 --> 04:56.422
drinking a seven and seven and seven.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.841
Seven shots of Seagram's Seven,
in seven minutes.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.468
It's Diana's morning drink.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.678
Oh, that's right,
it was very early in the morning!

05:02.762 --> 05:04.972
Well, this little spitfire finds out

05:05.014 --> 05:07.600
it's me who's closing down the bar,
next thing I know

05:07.683 --> 05:10.395
she's got a knife to my face!

05:10.561 --> 05:12.855
I would've been scared if she hadn't been
the most gorgeous thing

05:12.897 --> 05:14.690
- I've ever seen in my life.
- Aw.

05:14.816 --> 05:18.027
One thing leads to another and all
of a sudden we're playing tonsil tennis

05:18.069 --> 05:20.196
on a broken toilet in the alley out back.

05:20.446 --> 05:21.572
Cute!

05:21.989 --> 05:23.533
So how did you and Eleanor become friends?

05:23.574 --> 05:25.159
Well, let's just say that we...

05:25.660 --> 05:28.746
lived in the same... neighbourhood!

05:28.788 --> 05:30.164
Oh!

05:30.248 --> 05:32.458
What a fun way to say a normal
thing, right?

05:32.583 --> 05:35.711
Well, I've gotta go get ready,
today is PTA elections

05:35.753 --> 05:36.963
and I'm running for secretary.

05:37.088 --> 05:39.006
And she's a shoo-in, too. Hey, Patty!

05:39.340 --> 05:40.591
We gotta get ready, OK?

05:41.717 --> 05:44.679
I know we came here to set your mum
on a better path

05:44.762 --> 05:46.681
but I think she's doing pretty great.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.183
Please. She's completely full of it.

05:49.475 --> 05:52.645
I am gonna find out what kind of scam
Donna Shellstrop is running

05:52.687 --> 05:55.231
and I am gonna take her down.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.025
Right after I finish this awesome drink.

05:58.443 --> 06:00.903
- Man, Dave's margaritas are amazing.
- Right?

06:01.112 --> 06:03.156
And I'm not even a tequila guy.

06:03.656 --> 06:04.532
Wow.

06:06.451 --> 06:08.453
So this is what a museum looks like.

06:09.078 --> 06:14.959
If you look at this painting closely,
you can really notice the interpretation.

06:15.126 --> 06:18.337
I know you're just being silly,
and effortlessly charming

06:18.379 --> 06:21.966
but you actually just picked the most
valuable painting in the entire museum.

06:22.133 --> 06:26.762
As of last year, that work was valued
at 39.2 million dollars.

06:26.846 --> 06:30.683
Oh, snap, I forgot you know everything!
How much is that one worth?

06:30.766 --> 06:33.478
That one is worth 13.7 million dollars.

06:34.312 --> 06:36.898
That one's got a bunch of colours!
That's gotta add some value.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.983
Can we do this for all the paintings?

06:39.817 --> 06:41.402
Look. I've had a sort of...

06:41.819 --> 06:45.490
revelation about the world,
and I'd like to take responsibility

06:45.531 --> 06:48.576
for my part in our fraught history.

06:49.076 --> 06:54.665
For whatever hurt I've caused you,
I sincerely apologise.

06:55.833 --> 06:56.709
Thank you.

06:57.627 --> 07:00.296
I do not accept your apology.
Is that all, then?

07:03.799 --> 07:04.717
Well...

07:10.014 --> 07:10.890
Oh!

07:16.979 --> 07:17.897
Urgh!

07:19.565 --> 07:20.900
Check out what Dave gave me.

07:21.400 --> 07:26.656
Plans for a Subaru dealership-slash-burlesque
club he's designing in Reno!

07:27.240 --> 07:29.033
Man, Nevada's a mess!

07:29.242 --> 07:30.159
What are you doing?

07:30.201 --> 07:33.538
Searching for the tell-tale sign
of a Donna Shellstrop scam.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.000
A pile of cash hidden somewhere,
so she can grab it and head out on the run.

07:38.084 --> 07:40.545
When the time comes,
she will rip this guy off

07:40.586 --> 07:42.797
and disappear like Keyser Soze...

07:43.047 --> 07:45.424
right after he admitted
to groping all those people.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.510
- Why are you in my room?
- Oh, hey, girl!

07:47.802 --> 07:50.054
What's up? How old are you, three?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.556
- I'm nine.
- Cool.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.182
I don't know anything about kids.

07:53.307 --> 07:58.938
Hey, has Diana ever made you hide, like,
a special treasure in any of your toys?

07:59.021 --> 08:02.233
No, Diana's very nice to me.
She bought me most of these stuffed animals.

08:02.358 --> 08:04.694
Oh, wow! Neat.

08:04.777 --> 08:07.363
Mind if I give him just a little surgery
just to check?

08:07.446 --> 08:11.826
OK, OK, OK, alright, Doc McStuffins,
let's get you some fresh air.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.202
I'm so sorry.

08:13.369 --> 08:16.497
She's a kid. You can't disembowel her toys.

08:16.581 --> 08:21.168
Fine. New plan, you casually mention
that you're rich, and seduce Donna.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.797
When she goes for you, it will prove
that this whole thing is a sham!

08:25.006 --> 08:27.216
First things first, do you have a penis?

08:27.383 --> 08:29.093
I will not seduce Donna.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.929
For one thing,
I could never do that to my pal Dave.

08:32.013 --> 08:36.726
It goes against the architect's code.
Also, your mother seems happy here.

08:36.851 --> 08:41.022
The Donna I know wouldn't be caught dead
in this suburban boredom factory.

08:41.439 --> 08:43.774
She's scamming them!
Look, believe me, don't believe me.

08:43.858 --> 08:45.359
I don't care, I'm gonna prove it.

08:45.401 --> 08:48.821
Young lady, you will stop this nonsense

08:49.113 --> 08:52.158
go to the PTA meeting,
and support your mother.

08:52.408 --> 08:54.076
I won't hear another word about it!

08:55.828 --> 08:56.829
What the hell was that?

08:56.912 --> 09:00.625
Well, I was going for the "stern" but,
you know, "caring dad" vibe.

09:00.833 --> 09:01.834
No? Didn't work?

09:01.917 --> 09:04.003
No, not even close.
Like, not in the ballpark.

09:04.045 --> 09:07.256
I was trying something, Eleanor.
Give me a break.

09:07.923 --> 09:12.094
Until Kamilah accepts my apology,
this open wound will hinder any progress

09:12.136 --> 09:13.596
she might make toward
getting into the Good Place.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.682
Also, I'm going to strangle her

09:16.807 --> 09:19.685
which will hinder any air
from getting into her lungs.

09:19.894 --> 09:21.479
Can I talk to her?

09:21.562 --> 09:24.190
Maybe we should try a little
third-party mediation.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.780
Uh, hi. I'm Tahani's friend, Chidi.

09:31.030 --> 09:33.366
Chidi is an Igbo word
that means "God exists."

09:34.241 --> 09:35.743
That's right. Sorry...

09:35.826 --> 09:38.579
I don't know the etymology
of your name, but...

09:40.206 --> 09:42.667
All of your fears... are now mine.

09:46.671 --> 09:47.922
- What did she say?
- What?

09:48.631 --> 09:51.300
I don't know. Sorry, I got distracted.

09:51.550 --> 09:55.096
She's amazing!
All of my fears are hers now!

09:55.179 --> 09:56.305
Of course they are.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.601
Um...

10:00.726 --> 10:05.648
I sincerely apologised to you because
I have matured into a fully-formed adult

10:05.731 --> 10:07.692
with empathy and self-awareness.

10:07.817 --> 10:09.527
But if you don't accept my apology

10:09.568 --> 10:13.823
I will smash your stupid art exhibit
into bits!

10:13.906 --> 10:16.742
More Tahani theatrics,
with zero follow-through.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.370
You don't have it in you
to do anything that bold

10:19.412 --> 10:21.914
because I'm the one
who got the boldness gene.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.625
And the good eyebrow gene.

10:25.751 --> 10:26.627
Oh!

10:27.086 --> 10:29.338
Oh, no! All my fears are mine again!

10:30.798 --> 10:33.426
Hey, Davey, can you believe the design
of this room?

10:33.676 --> 10:36.470
Auditorium? More like "audi-bore me-um."

10:37.972 --> 10:38.931
Savage!

10:39.557 --> 10:41.809
Hello, I'm Diana Tremaine.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.478
I never thought I'd run for a PTA board.

10:44.729 --> 10:47.356
For most of my life, I preferred to crawl.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.067
Pub crawl!

10:50.192 --> 10:52.403
But now, I want to make sure kids

10:52.486 --> 10:55.156
in this decommissioned
military bombing test site

10:55.239 --> 11:00.119
turned-suburban township
get the best education Nevada has to offer.

11:00.286 --> 11:02.913
What's that, "always double down on 11"?

11:02.997 --> 11:06.792
Also, there is a pretty great kid
who goes to this school

11:06.876 --> 11:10.921
and I want to make this place great for her.
Stand up, sweetheart!

11:16.635 --> 11:19.013
Well, it was the first Hooters
ever made out of brick.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.557
- Sort of inspired by Monticello.
- Hey, mark.

11:21.599 --> 11:23.684
- Oh, nope, it's Dave.
- I know your name.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.394
I'm calling you a mark.

11:25.478 --> 11:26.479
Easy.

11:26.562 --> 11:28.355
I got news for you, dad-bod.

11:28.439 --> 11:32.359
The woman you know as Diana Tremaine
is really Donna Shellstrop

11:32.443 --> 11:34.695
my much older mother.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.448
She faked her death and changed her name.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.034
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but that's the deal.

11:41.035 --> 11:42.787
I already knew all that, Eleanor.

11:43.287 --> 11:46.123
Your mother told me everything
the first night we met.

11:46.332 --> 11:48.584
- The first night?
- Well, no, not the first night, actually.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.544
That was mostly sex, you know...

11:50.669 --> 11:53.839
Your mother is a very confident
and selfish lover.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.758
- Yikes.
- Oh, no, no, it's perfect for me

11:55.800 --> 11:59.178
cos I don't know what I want. But anyway,
the next morning she told me everything.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.472
And we're gonna tell Patricia
once she's a little bit older.

12:01.555 --> 12:05.643
- For now, everything is going great!
- No, dude, you don't know my mum.

12:05.810 --> 12:08.062
She used to put like 50 things
in a shopping cart

12:08.145 --> 12:11.524
then go to the "12 items or less" aisle,
scream "Rat!"

12:11.565 --> 12:13.234
and run out the door without paying.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.610
She is a liar.

12:14.652 --> 12:16.946
Well, listen, she has been nothing
but honest with me

12:16.987 --> 12:20.825
and I like that she's got a wild streak,
kinda gets my motor running!

12:20.866 --> 12:25.287
Tell you the truth, she's turning me
into a bit of a bad boy!

12:25.412 --> 12:27.873
I mean, who am I, Avril Lavigne?

12:32.795 --> 12:34.630
Oh, I get it.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.091
Coming clean was all part of the scam!

12:37.132 --> 12:39.468
It's brilliant,
because he thinks she's honest

12:39.510 --> 12:42.596
so when she runs off with all his money,
he'll never see it coming.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.599
Come on, Eleanor. I changed. You changed.

12:45.683 --> 12:47.810
- Maybe she changed, too.
- No.

12:47.852 --> 12:48.727
No way.

12:48.811 --> 12:53.649
Why can't you accept that she might be
living a good, honest life?

12:53.858 --> 12:57.194
That she's an attentive partner
and a good mum?

12:57.236 --> 12:59.196
Because I wanted that mum!

12:59.822 --> 13:04.368
I wanted the mum who made me afternoon snacks
instead of just telling me to look for

13:04.410 --> 13:06.620
loose fries in the McDonald's ball pit.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.372
Why does Patricia get that mum?

13:08.622 --> 13:11.208
If Donna Shellstrop has truly changed

13:11.292 --> 13:13.502
then that means she was always capable
of change

13:13.669 --> 13:16.630
but I... I just wasn't worth changing for.

13:18.924 --> 13:23.929
I-I know as your self-appointed father
figure I'm supposed to say something

13:23.971 --> 13:27.600
comforting here, but I'm...
I'm kinda stumped.

13:28.017 --> 13:30.060
OK, final tally!

13:30.144 --> 13:32.688
Forty-three votes for Diana Tremaine.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.899
12 votes for Eileen Capshaw.

13:35.065 --> 13:38.319
And one vote for "Bofa Deeznutz."

13:39.528 --> 13:42.781
Oh, don't look at me like that.
You're not my real dad.

13:48.454 --> 13:51.707
Congratulations, Madame Secretary.

13:51.832 --> 13:55.085
So crazy, right?
I'm gonna need to get a calculator!

13:55.169 --> 13:59.214
And maybe a globe?
I don't really understand the job.

13:59.423 --> 14:03.677
Listen, I'm... I'm sorry that I didn't
think this whole thing was real.

14:04.094 --> 14:07.806
I just never thought I'd see the day
when you made a commitment to...

14:08.474 --> 14:09.350
anything.

14:09.642 --> 14:10.684
I was wrong.

14:11.352 --> 14:13.562
Thank you, baby. That means a lot.

14:15.356 --> 14:16.315
Let me help you.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.108
No, no, no, not that one! Not that one!

14:18.192 --> 14:20.903
No, sorry, sorry,
this powder is only for my delicates.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.364
You don't wash your bras.

14:23.906 --> 14:24.990
No! No...

14:25.240 --> 14:26.909
I knew it!

14:26.992 --> 14:29.536
- Ugh...
- My mother is a con artist!

14:29.954 --> 14:31.121
Gotcha!

14:31.747 --> 14:34.416
So, before I'm tortured in the afterlife

14:34.500 --> 14:39.713
I get to spend the rest of this life in a
Hungarian prison for destruction of art!

14:40.089 --> 14:41.340
That's fun!

14:41.548 --> 14:44.051
Destruction of extremely derivative art.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.470
Kamilah's work has been mediocre for years.

14:46.679 --> 14:50.557
Mother and father are probably rolling over
in their cryogenic chambers.

14:50.724 --> 14:51.600
Really?

14:52.142 --> 14:56.021
You don't think they would be proud of her
for having a whole museum wing

14:56.063 --> 14:57.564
dedicated to her work?

14:57.606 --> 15:03.070
My parents' standards were incredibly high
and they were impossible to please.

15:03.153 --> 15:06.323
Plus they always pitted my sister and me
against each other.

15:06.532 --> 15:09.994
The two of them were a unit,
and Kamilah and I...

15:14.456 --> 15:17.126
Girls. We have a new challenge for you.

15:17.292 --> 15:21.714
Each of you has four hours to complete
a rendering of your favourite moment

15:21.755 --> 15:23.674
in French Military History.

15:23.799 --> 15:27.720
The winning painting shall be hung
in our foyer during our party

15:27.761 --> 15:29.596
honouring François Mitterrand.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.725
The losing painting shall provide
the kindling for the fire

15:32.766 --> 15:36.645
that rages in our hearth during that party.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.480
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.190
Yes, Mother, it does.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.817
Thank you for this opportunity.

15:41.942 --> 15:46.238
Who will be the winning artist,
and who will fail?

15:46.655 --> 15:48.991
Let's find out!

15:53.662 --> 15:55.080
These paintings...

15:57.624 --> 15:59.043
they're us.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.335
You're the boobs?

16:01.211 --> 16:03.547
Sorry, once Jason said it,
that's all I can see.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.094
Here we go...

16:09.887 --> 16:10.763
What?

16:12.681 --> 16:14.808
Tahani, what are you doing? Stop it.

16:14.892 --> 16:17.311
No. I'm going to hug
you because I love you.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.355
And because you feel just as alone as I do.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.443
I'm sorry our parents were such wankers.

16:24.985 --> 16:27.571
And I understand
that you can't accept my apology

16:27.613 --> 16:30.324
because that would quench
your creative thirst.

16:30.824 --> 16:34.870
They forced us to compete,
and that competition has fuelled your art

16:34.953 --> 16:36.163
for decades.

16:36.705 --> 16:40.000
It's so awful, and I'm so sorry.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.673
They were wankers, weren't they?

16:46.799 --> 16:50.636
Oh! The absolute biggest wankers on Earth.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.142
Let them go, please.

17:02.523 --> 17:03.440
Mwah!

17:04.525 --> 17:06.819
Diana Tremaine, you little devil.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.695
New name, same game.

17:08.987 --> 17:09.905
Fine.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.950
Things have been going
good with me and Dave

17:13.033 --> 17:17.079
but sometimes I sneak a little bit of cash
out of his wallet and I hide it away

17:17.162 --> 17:20.332
just in case everything blows up
and I need to skip town.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.416
Are you happy?

17:23.127 --> 17:24.962
Actually, no. I'm not happy.

17:25.629 --> 17:26.964
But I think you are.

17:27.256 --> 17:29.341
You're holding on to this exit strategy

17:29.424 --> 17:32.553
telling yourself that you can bail
at any time, but the truth is

17:33.887 --> 17:35.889
you love this suburban life.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.016
I don't love it so much.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.018
I am not basic!

17:40.352 --> 17:41.311
Ya basic!

17:41.478 --> 17:42.563
No, Mum...

17:43.438 --> 17:44.523
<i>ya</i> basic.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.941
And that's OK.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.570
Let me ask you something,
why are you wearing yoga pants?

17:49.903 --> 17:54.158
Well, on Tuesday nights I do restorative yoga
with a bunch of mums from Patty's school.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.743
- And what do you do after yoga?
- We split avocado egg rolls

17:56.785 --> 17:59.454
at the Cheesecake Factory,
but we also drink!

17:59.496 --> 18:01.373
- What do you drink?
- Chardonnay.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.959
With ice cubes.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.253
And after one glass, I get sleepy

18:06.587 --> 18:10.132
so I usually switch to water
so I can drive home

18:10.257 --> 18:11.758
like a nerd!

18:11.842 --> 18:12.885
Hey, hey.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.345
It's OK.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.514
It's good. You're happy here.

18:18.015 --> 18:21.310
But you need to commit to this

18:22.311 --> 18:25.731
which means getting rid of that stash
of escape money.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.942
And I think you know
what you have to do with it.

18:30.444 --> 18:31.945
Send it to Gene Simmons?

18:32.029 --> 18:33.030
What? No.

18:34.198 --> 18:36.074
Spend it on Patricia.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.328
Set up a college fund, buy her a... crib.

18:39.536 --> 18:43.373
Or a car? I-I truly don't know anything
about kids, but...

18:43.874 --> 18:49.296
this is your chance to break the chain
of Shellstrop-mother-daughter crappiness.

18:49.671 --> 18:53.091
You have a do-over. Use it.

18:54.051 --> 18:54.927
Oh, baby.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.388
It seems like you've turned into
a really good person

18:58.472 --> 19:02.726
and you clearly didn't get that from me,
so, props to whoever helped you.

19:05.062 --> 19:06.605
Is there more cash in your bra?

19:06.647 --> 19:08.649
Always, that's why I don't wash them.

19:11.401 --> 19:14.446
I still can't believe that police officer
pulled you over just to tell you

19:14.488 --> 19:15.989
that you were driving perfectly.

19:16.073 --> 19:17.741
Why not? I was!

19:17.824 --> 19:21.662
There is an article in the paper
about Kamilah's latest art installation

19:21.787 --> 19:22.746
and look.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.750
"A Fractured Inheritance"
by Kamilah Al-Jamil <i>and...</i>

19:26.959 --> 19:28.377
Tahani Al-Jamil.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.338
Gosh. That was very big of her.

19:31.463 --> 19:36.927
Though she really should have named the
piece "A Buried Hatchet," don't you think?

19:37.094 --> 19:38.387
Such a better title!

19:38.512 --> 19:41.014
- I'm going to call her and rub it in!
- Maybe don't.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.057
For now.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.141
Yes.

19:43.308 --> 19:44.184
Smart.

19:44.268 --> 19:46.186
Good luck, buddy. Oh!

19:46.228 --> 19:48.605
Hey, I almost forgot,
I sketched you up a little something.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.525
Some ideas there for your, uh...
your project.

19:51.733 --> 19:52.901
- Wow!
- Yeah.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.988
Well, this is more than a few ideas,
you solved the whole thing!

19:56.071 --> 19:57.572
Columns, and porticos...

19:57.739 --> 19:58.615
Uh-oh.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.618
Looks like you forgot to include bathrooms.

20:01.702 --> 20:03.912
Oops. Well, just a little oversight.

20:04.162 --> 20:07.082
I certainly use the bathroom,
like anybody else.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.835
Love to sit on the... the thing and just,
you know

20:09.918 --> 20:10.836
shoot one out.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.379
Eleanor, I'll be in the car!

20:13.171 --> 20:16.883
It was really nice to meet you, Patricia.
Got a lot of people who care about you here.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.553
And good luck with the...

20:20.637 --> 20:22.139
- SATS.
- I'm nine.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.474
Whatever, good luck in school, you get it.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.314
The others are on their way back
from Budapest.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.733
We'll be picking them up in a few hours.

20:33.650 --> 20:34.860
Oh, be happy!

20:35.193 --> 20:39.656
Your mum found a better path all on her own,
and you definitely helped Patricia.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.075
- Double happy ending.
- I know, I'm just...

20:42.242 --> 20:43.410
I'm a little sad.

20:43.493 --> 20:48.540
I'm glad my mum has changed, but that
doesn't fix all the damage she did to me.

20:48.623 --> 20:52.169
Let's face it, she's the reason
I could never get close to anyone.

20:52.336 --> 20:55.088
I never even told a boyfriend I love him.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.592
Oh, crap. Um...

21:00.177 --> 21:04.556
You remember how I told that you knew
everything important about your life?

21:04.639 --> 21:08.393
Well, I wasn't thinking about
your afterlife life.

21:08.769 --> 21:12.481
In one of the reboots, you and...
and Chidi fell in love.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.232
Deeply, and...

21:14.608 --> 21:16.902
you told him that you loved him, and...

21:16.985 --> 21:19.696
and he told you that he loved you back.

21:21.198 --> 21:22.157
We did what now?

21:22.449 --> 21:24.618
Do you wanna listen to a podcast, maybe?
