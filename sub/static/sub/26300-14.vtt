09:36.957 --> 09:39.177
but I don't understand it
and feel real stupid.

09:40.573 --> 09:43.366
(SCOFFS) You're not stupid.

09:43.391 --> 09:46.350
You're smart and you're
strong and you're brave.

09:47.184 --> 09:51.096
I mean, not too many people would
file for custody of a baby at 18.

09:51.970 --> 09:54.521
What can I say, he's all
the blood I got right now.

09:56.485 --> 09:59.693
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that
to come off the way it did, Miss C.

09:59.718 --> 10:00.740
It's okay.

10:01.198 --> 10:02.656
Just keep stabbing.

10:02.681 --> 10:04.457
- (WHISPERS): I'm sorry.
- (LAUGHS SOFTLY)

10:05.749 --> 10:08.258
Girl, it's just hard for
me not to mother y'all.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.527
I mean, you slept in my
bed, for crying out loud.

10:13.451 --> 10:14.688
But you're adults now.

10:17.302 --> 10:21.421
So I'll respect whatever
decision you make with Star.

10:22.604 --> 10:25.723
I just keep staring at her, you know?

10:28.184 --> 10:29.918
I can't fix this one for you.

10:34.116 --> 10:36.692
But I'll be here with you through it.

10:37.860 --> 10:40.010
Don't worry, the answer will come.

10:40.012 --> 10:42.319
I think that's what Star believes, too.

10:47.083 --> 10:48.842
I'll do that performance.

10:50.173 --> 10:51.173
For her.

10:54.344 --> 10:55.441
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

10:55.466 --> 10:56.794
Alex, can I get a statement?

10:56.819 --> 10:58.608
- I'm not commenting about Star, thank you.
- No, no, no, no.

10:58.632 --> 10:59.999
We're talking about the wedding.

11:00.024 --> 11:01.893
I know I've been waiting for this.

11:01.918 --> 11:04.083
We all saw the love
in that sex tape. Fire.

11:04.108 --> 11:05.865
- Can we see the ring?
- (SCOFFS)

11:05.890 --> 11:08.239
Oh, no ring? Is Derek slipping?

11:08.264 --> 11:09.779
What? No. Of course not.

11:09.804 --> 11:10.834
So, y'all are happy for real?

11:10.858 --> 11:13.220
Yes. Okay? I am the
happiest I've ever been.

11:13.245 --> 11:14.945
Yeah, we're all real happy.

11:15.331 --> 11:16.869
See you inside, Alex.

11:16.894 --> 11:18.861
(DOOR OPENS)

11:26.056 --> 11:29.018
You bitches done turned my
daddy's trailer into a ho house?

11:30.025 --> 11:31.267
If y'all gonna be staying here,

11:31.292 --> 11:32.939
we gonna lay down some ground rules.

11:32.964 --> 11:35.631
Rule one: don't be trifling-ass bitches.

11:36.712 --> 11:37.931
Where are the other girls?

11:37.956 --> 11:40.622
They ran out to get some money,
just like I'm about to do.

11:40.647 --> 11:43.639
- Excuse me.
- You asked me to protect y'all from Leon.

11:43.664 --> 11:45.194
Look, I am out of estrogen.

11:45.219 --> 11:47.656
- Okay? I'm growing hair in places.
- TMI.

11:47.681 --> 11:49.418
You cannot be roaming the streets

11:49.443 --> 11:51.293
with Leon looking for you.

11:51.318 --> 11:52.478
I ain't you, Cotton. Okay?

11:52.503 --> 11:54.035
I don't have some nice life.

11:54.379 --> 11:56.567
Leon hooked all of us up with
clothes, hormones and breasts.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.711
Why you think we stayed?

11:57.736 --> 12:00.436
S-So you gonna go
regardless of what I say.

12:00.461 --> 12:02.302
Listen, I'm-a run into
one of my regulars, okay,

12:02.326 --> 12:03.904
and come straight back. It's quick money

12:03.928 --> 12:05.637
- and it ain't through Leon, so I'm good.
- Di...

12:05.661 --> 12:07.077
Thank you.

12:12.851 --> 12:14.745
What up, Miss C? You wanted to see me?

12:14.770 --> 12:18.026
Yeah. I wanted to lay my eyes on you.

12:19.093 --> 12:20.093
Sit down.

12:21.418 --> 12:22.700
(SIGHS)

12:22.725 --> 12:25.260
Look, I know what you gonna say.

12:25.285 --> 12:26.767
All right? I'm 12 days sober,

12:26.792 --> 12:28.912
and I'm ready to pick the songs
for our ASA tribute concert.

12:28.936 --> 12:31.283
Noah, I think maybe
you need to take a break

12:31.308 --> 12:32.894
before you get back on stage, man.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.277
Come on, I-I don't need a break.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.504
This is me you talking to.

12:37.629 --> 12:39.690
Now, we done had this
conversation way too many times.

12:39.714 --> 12:40.775
And this is the last one.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.410
I'm never gonna hurt
Davis like that again.

12:42.434 --> 12:44.394
- All right? I...
- DIANNE: Noah?

12:46.536 --> 12:48.605
Uh... Mama? What...?

12:48.630 --> 12:50.234
Why haven't you been answering my calls?

12:50.259 --> 12:51.480
I've been worried sick.

12:51.505 --> 12:53.208
I've been busy with
work and-and the baby...

12:53.232 --> 12:54.398
What-what are you doing here?

12:54.423 --> 12:56.503
I asked Miss Brown to help me reach you.

12:58.959 --> 13:00.460
Well, I'm doing fine, all right?

13:00.485 --> 13:02.643
- Look at me. I'm good.
- Oh, I am looking.

13:02.668 --> 13:04.675
And I can see straight through it, baby.

13:07.461 --> 13:08.948
This is all my fault.

13:10.167 --> 13:13.646
Baby, when your dad left me,
I went down a dark path...

13:13.671 --> 13:15.814
- Mom, Mom, look, look...
- ... and you never should have seen me like that.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.773
NOAH: I-I'm good, all right? I swear.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.970
No, you need to take a step back.

13:20.588 --> 13:23.322
Between the accident
and-and a new baby?

13:23.347 --> 13:26.291
I can't stop. I got ASAs and-and Davis?

13:26.316 --> 13:27.963
Then let me help with Davis.

13:28.834 --> 13:30.033
Why won't you let me help?

13:30.058 --> 13:32.412
Because it's my
responsibility, Mama, come on.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.521
Look, I'm glad you came by.

13:35.546 --> 13:37.045
I got this, stop worrying.

13:37.070 --> 13:39.111
Let me be the son you raised.

13:50.776 --> 13:53.016
Thank you for setting up
this meeting, Ms. Brown.

13:54.388 --> 13:55.721
You got kids?

13:57.415 --> 13:58.449
Yeah.

14:01.052 --> 14:02.778
Then you know this feeling.

14:03.897 --> 14:08.066
I felt it the moment I
knew he was in my belly.

14:11.723 --> 14:14.331
I wanted to protect him from everything

14:14.760 --> 14:16.889
and anything this world
could throw at him.

14:17.453 --> 14:19.245
But first, God,

14:19.731 --> 14:24.274
let him be healthy and
make it into the world...

14:25.918 --> 14:30.579
... then let him be smart,
then handsome,

14:31.135 --> 14:33.410
talented, kind.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.997
But the world can be so hard.

14:46.056 --> 14:47.220
I thought,

14:49.300 --> 14:52.384
<i>maybe he could find some peace
if he wasn't in this world.</i>

14:56.341 --> 14:58.846
What mother dreams that for her child?

15:08.370 --> 15:11.413
- (DAVIS FUSSING)
- Oh, I know. I know.

15:11.850 --> 15:14.258
Yeah, there you go. Get comfy.

15:14.661 --> 15:15.703
There we go.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.167
You're late.

15:19.192 --> 15:20.576
I'm aware.

15:20.601 --> 15:22.059
(PHONE CHIMES)

15:22.476 --> 15:24.568
Yo, my mom is really driving me insane.

15:25.022 --> 15:26.414
I know her heart's in the right place,

15:26.438 --> 15:28.438
but she's making all this
wedding stuff about her.

15:28.463 --> 15:30.463
Oh, that's funny coming
from you right now.

15:30.488 --> 15:32.484
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Look, I know

15:32.509 --> 15:34.727
that you and Star butt heads,
but I thought that you cared

15:34.751 --> 15:36.225
about her more than you showed.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.686
I do.

15:37.905 --> 15:39.240
Okay, well, Star's been in the hospital

15:39.264 --> 15:41.305
and you haven't visited her in a week.

15:41.409 --> 15:43.053
And then I called you
about the surgery...

15:43.077 --> 15:45.637
- Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry.
- NOAH: There's my boy.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.057
Hey, what's up, man?

15:49.703 --> 15:52.429
I missed you, too. I'm back, I'm back.

15:52.741 --> 15:54.821
Oh, my God. I missed you so much...

15:56.975 --> 15:59.152
Hey, Alex, you mind if I
have a moment with Simone?

15:59.853 --> 16:00.957
Sure.

16:03.918 --> 16:05.907
Look, I'm sorry about what happened.

16:06.602 --> 16:08.044
You're sorry?

16:08.069 --> 16:10.080
You're sorry you almost killed
Davis because you were high?

16:10.104 --> 16:12.084
Okay. Look, I know, all right?

16:12.109 --> 16:14.384
I know, and I appreciate
you for taking care of him.

16:14.409 --> 16:15.812
I'm-I'm getting myself back together.

16:15.836 --> 16:17.493
I'm-I'm 12 days sober today.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.463
I'm ready to move
back into Star's and...

16:19.488 --> 16:21.096
do things right this time.

16:21.149 --> 16:23.407
That's amazing. Congratulations.

16:23.468 --> 16:25.635
- But that ain't happening.
- Okay.

16:26.596 --> 16:28.263
I messed up, but...

16:28.288 --> 16:29.421
There ain't no buts.

16:29.991 --> 16:31.324
Okay? Davis ain't going home with you.

16:31.326 --> 16:34.160
Simone... I will call the police on you.

16:34.162 --> 16:35.731
- This is my son, not...
- Okay,

16:35.755 --> 16:37.163
you go and call the police.

16:37.165 --> 16:39.525
You go and do that, and then
I'll call social services,

16:39.559 --> 16:41.737
- and they'll be at your door in two hours.

16:41.761 --> 16:43.895
SIMONE: Well, you want
to let them decide?

16:43.927 --> 16:46.059
My sister's in the hospital,
fighting for her life.

16:46.084 --> 16:48.152
And if you want to throw yours
away, that's totally fine,

16:48.176 --> 16:49.645
- but you ain't gonna do that to Davis.
- Okay, okay, okay.

16:49.669 --> 16:50.895
- You understand me?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

16:50.919 --> 16:52.419
But you're not in charge of Davis. I am.

16:52.443 --> 16:54.643
You sure about that? 'Cause I just filed

16:54.668 --> 16:55.798
for temporary custody over him

16:55.822 --> 16:57.982
until Star gets her
ass out of the hospital.

16:59.337 --> 17:00.844
You get yourself together.

17:01.465 --> 17:02.815

worried about her a little bit.

18:34.773 --> 18:37.159
and in the studio non-stop
since my aunt passed.

18:37.184 --> 18:39.500
Look, come on, GiGi,
right now is not the time

18:39.525 --> 18:41.025
to pull a stunt like this before ASAs.

18:41.049 --> 18:42.463
This isn't a stunt, okay?

18:42.488 --> 18:43.946

through a lot lately.

And if you need to
talk about it, I'm here,

18:49.163 --> 18:51.341
but this performance is very
important to your career.

Well, that ain't what
it looked like, GiGi.

18:57.917 --> 18:59.279
Okay, you know what? I'm
gonna have to get myself

18:59.303 --> 19:01.227
on out of here before
I catch me a charge.

19:01.252 --> 19:02.492

is have another man play me.
