00:08.240 --> 00:10.840

&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:12.440

00:32.119 --> 00:34.240
&lrm;<i>you'll have the opportunity of a lifetime,</i>

00:34.360 --> 00:37.120
&lrm;<i>the chance to talk live</i>
&lrm;<i>with Ladybug and Cat Noir!</i>

00:37.240 --> 00:39.120
&lrm;<i>Along with me, Nadia Chamack.</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:43.240
&lrm;<i>We'll reveal sizzling-hot information</i>
&lrm;<i>about your favourite superheroes!</i>

00:43.360 --> 00:45.240
&lrm;<i>Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>

00:45.360 --> 00:47.200
&lrm;Sizzling-hot revelations?

00:47.320 --> 00:51.600
&lrm;Can you believe it, Tikki? An hourlong
&lrm;special about me and Cat Noir!

00:51.720 --> 00:54.040
&lrm;-Pretty exciting, huh?
&lrm;-But, Marinette,

00:54.160 --> 00:58.240
&lrm;you're a superhero, not a star!
&lrm;You have to remain a mystery,

00:58.360 --> 01:01.480
&lrm;to protect yourself from Hawk Moth
&lrm;and all his supervillains!

01:01.600 --> 01:04.920
&lrm;Don't worry. I only accepted this
&lrm;because I want the people of Paris

01:05.040 --> 01:08.800
&lrm;to know that Cat Noir and I will always
&lrm;do whatever it takes to keep them safe.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.680
&lrm;Just be careful tonight, OK?

01:11.800 --> 01:14.520
&lrm;Tonight? What do you mean?
&lrm;Tonight I have babysitting.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.840
&lrm;-The show is tomorrow!
&lrm;<i>-Don't forget, tonight! Face-to-Face,</i>

01:17.960 --> 01:20.360
&lrm;<i>live with Ladybug and Cat noir!</i>

01:20.480 --> 01:23.280
&lrm;And that's probably why
&lrm;you babysit tonight.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.040
&lrm;Marinette! Marinette!

01:27.160 --> 01:29.160
&lrm;Manon! Mrs. Chamack!

01:29.280 --> 01:32.400
&lrm;I, uh, I just saw your ad
&lrm;for your show... tonight.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.120
&lrm;Sorry, I'm running late.
&lrm;Thanks for watching Manon.

01:35.240 --> 01:38.040
&lrm;I've put lots of things for her in here.
&lrm;She's had dinner.

01:38.160 --> 01:43.040
&lrm;-I'm so glad you're free tonight.
&lrm;-Uh, yeah. I had no other plans.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.440
&lrm;-No plans at all!
&lrm;-I better get going.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.600
&lrm;A lot is riding on this interview. I need
&lrm;all of Paris in front of the screen.

01:49.720 --> 01:53.000
&lrm;Sweetie, just for tonight,
&lrm;you can watch TV with Marinette!

01:53.120 --> 01:57.680
&lrm;Yay! Mommy will be on TV
&lrm;with Ladybug and Cat Noir!

01:57.800 --> 02:01.720
&lrm;You'll do great, Mrs. Chamack!
&lrm;Besides, you already have two viewers!

02:01.840 --> 02:03.960
&lrm;Wish me luck!
&lrm;Tell your friends to tune in!

02:04.080 --> 02:05.120
&lrm;I will!

02:11.039 --> 02:12.520
&lrm;Uh, Alya?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.320
&lrm;<i>We're on air in ten.</i>
&lrm;<i>Still no cat in sight.</i>

02:23.440 --> 02:27.280
&lrm;<i>-Sure you have this in control, Nadia?</i>
&lrm;-Yes, Arlette. I got this, as promised.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.920
&lrm;<i>-Biggest audience of the year.</i>
&lrm;<i>-Let's hope so,</i>

02:30.040 --> 02:33.640
&lrm;<i>if you want to keep this show</i>
&lrm;<i>on prime time in the future.</i>

02:36.680 --> 02:38.200
&lrm;[sighs]

02:43.840 --> 02:46.160
&lrm;Huh? How the... Which way did you come in?

02:46.280 --> 02:48.480
&lrm;Secret celebrity door.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.280
&lrm;-I see Ladybug's running behind.
&lrm;-I thought you'd arrive together!

02:52.400 --> 02:54.560
&lrm;-Do you wanna hear a secret?
&lrm;-Mmm-hmm.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.280
&lrm;I love chouquettes!

02:57.760 --> 03:00.960
&lrm;<i>Is that the sizzling-hot information</i>
&lrm;<i>I've been promised?</i>

03:01.080 --> 03:03.720
&lrm;-No! Of course not!
&lrm;-Well, you know the rules.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.480
&lrm;Prime time, prime info.
&lrm;No info, no more show.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.320
&lrm;-We're on the air in five!
&lrm;-I'm sorry. She's not picking up.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.800
&lrm;Super-Manon to the rescue! Whoo!

03:14.920 --> 03:17.640
&lrm;To the Eiffel Tower and beyond!

03:17.760 --> 03:20.480
&lrm;-Glad you could make it last minute.
&lrm;-Of course!

03:20.600 --> 03:26.280
&lrm;It's way more fun watching your favourite
&lrm;superhero on TV with my favourite girls!

03:30.400 --> 03:34.360
&lrm;<i>When we return, Nadia Chamack will be</i>
&lrm;<i>joined by Ladybug and Cat Noir,</i>

03:34.480 --> 03:36.440
&lrm;<i>for an incredible exclusive interview!</i>

03:36.560 --> 03:37.960
&lrm;Mommy! There's mommy!

03:38.080 --> 03:42.560
&lrm;Why can't I get an exclusive interview
&lrm;like that for my Ladyblog?

03:42.680 --> 03:45.440
&lrm;Oh! I forgot to,
&lrm;uh, tell my bakery something!

03:45.560 --> 03:47.360
&lrm;They're in the parents, downstairs.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.680
&lrm;Do you mind keeping an eye on Manon?

03:49.800 --> 03:52.320
&lrm;You mean,
&lrm;"Talk to your parents in the bakery."

03:52.440 --> 03:55.880
&lrm;Uh... Right!, well, uh,
&lrm;sometimes it can take a while.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.360
&lrm;They don't always understand.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.920
&lrm;Actually, it's not their fault, they--

04:00.040 --> 04:01.400
&lrm;-Marinette?
&lrm;-Yes?

04:01.520 --> 04:03.240
&lrm;-Go!
&lrm;-Right!

04:07.720 --> 04:11.320
&lrm;Alya is such a good friend.
&lrm;I feel so guilty about inviting her over

04:11.440 --> 04:13.920
&lrm;just so I could leave her with Manon!
&lrm;Then again,

04:14.040 --> 04:15.880
&lrm;Alya is Ladybug's biggest fan,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.680
&lrm;and she'd be crushed if her favourite
&lrm;superhero didn't turn up for her TV show!

04:20.079 --> 04:22.200
&lrm;It's your choice, Marinette.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.160
&lrm;Hmm. Well...

04:25.400 --> 04:28.440
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

04:49.480 --> 04:51.480
&lrm;Going live in ten... nine...

04:51.600 --> 04:54.680
&lrm;Eight seconds from
&lrm;the greatest fail in TV history.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.520
&lrm;<i>Five... four... three...</i>

05:07.120 --> 05:09.080
&lrm;I thought you'd decided to stand me up.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.080
&lrm;And let the audience down? Never!

05:11.200 --> 05:13.280
&lrm;I'm sorry I'm so late, Nadia.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.640
&lrm;<i>Saved by the bug.</i>

05:14.760 --> 05:18.160
&lrm;<i>Well, now I'm counting on you</i>
&lrm;<i>to boost those ratings sky high!</i>

05:18.280 --> 05:20.640
&lrm;<i>Make that red turn green.</i>

05:23.720 --> 05:24.880
&lrm;Hmm.

05:27.440 --> 05:31.120
&lrm;<i>Good evening. I'm Nadia Chamack</i>
&lrm;<i>and this is Face-to-Face.</i>

05:31.240 --> 05:34.680
&lrm;<i>For our first edition,</i>
&lrm;<i>I welcome the beloved guardians of Paris,</i>

05:34.800 --> 05:36.760
&lrm;<i>Ladybug and Cat Noir! Hello!</i>

05:36.880 --> 05:40.080
&lrm;<i>Thanks so much for accepting</i>
&lrm;<i>this exclusive live interview!</i>

05:40.200 --> 05:42.600
&lrm;<i>Thank you, Nadia.</i>
&lrm;<i>We're honoured to be here!</i>

05:42.720 --> 05:45.480
&lrm;<i>And hello to all my fans!</i>

05:45.600 --> 05:47.920
&lrm;<i>I'm sure thousands have tuned in tonight.</i>

05:48.040 --> 05:51.160
&lrm;<i>Don't encourage him or the cat</i>
&lrm;<i>won't stop purring all night.</i>

05:51.760 --> 05:54.520
&lrm;<i>Don't listen to her.</i>
&lrm;<i>Bugaboo's just a spot jealous.</i>

05:54.640 --> 05:57.680
&lrm;<i>I thought we agreed on</i>
&lrm;<i>no more Bugaboo-calling, Pussycat!</i>

05:57.800 --> 06:00.160
&lrm;But it's so cute!

06:00.560 --> 06:03.680
&lrm;<i>Ha, ha, ha!</i>
&lrm;<i>It's obvious you two are very close!</i>

06:04.880 --> 06:08.880
&lrm;-Marinette is missing the whole thing!
&lrm;-What could that girl be doing?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.200
&lrm;<i>People know you,</i>
&lrm;<i>but they don't</i>&lrm; really&lrm;<i> know you.</i>

06:12.320 --> 06:15.360
&lrm;<i>We see you saving Paris,</i>
&lrm;<i>but don't know anything else.</i>

06:15.480 --> 06:17.840
&lrm;<i>We won't be keeping anything</i>
&lrm;<i>from you tonight.</i>

06:17.960 --> 06:22.480
&lrm;<i>Well, we do have to keep a few secrets,</i>
&lrm;<i>including our identities, of course.</i>

06:24.280 --> 06:25.200
&lrm;<i>Absolutely.</i>

06:25.320 --> 06:28.240
&lrm;<i>How about we start off with questions</i>
&lrm;<i>from your biggest fans?</i>

06:28.360 --> 06:29.240
&lrm;<i>Yup, let's do it!</i>

06:30.800 --> 06:33.480
&lrm;<i>Hello, caller,</i>
&lrm;<i>state your name and your question.</i>

06:34.240 --> 06:38.360
&lrm;<i>Seriously, Nadia? Surely no one else</i>
&lrm;<i>would be the first caller but me!</i>

06:38.480 --> 06:40.760
&lrm;<i>I'm only</i>
&lrm;<i>the most prestigious fan of Ladybug!</i>

06:40.880 --> 06:43.760
&lrm;<i>Oh, yes, of course,</i>
&lrm;<i>hello there, Chloé Bourgeois,</i>

06:43.880 --> 06:45.160
&lrm;<i>daughter of the Mayor of Paris.</i>

06:45.280 --> 06:46.640
&lrm;<i>And don't forget Daddy</i>

06:46.760 --> 06:50.760
&lrm;<i>is the manager of the Grand Paris,</i>
&lrm;<i>the best luxury hotel in the entire city!</i>

06:50.880 --> 06:53.960
&lrm;<i>Uh, thank you for reminding us.</i>
&lrm;<i>What is your question, Chloé?</i>

06:54.520 --> 06:57.200
&lrm;<i>Oh, I don't have a question.</i>
&lrm;<i>I just wanted to say "Hi",</i>

06:57.320 --> 06:59.920
&lrm;<i>since, as you all know,</i>
&lrm;<i>we are such very good friends,</i>

07:00.040 --> 07:01.920
&lrm;<i>Ladybug, Cat Noir and I.</i>

07:03.040 --> 07:05.080
&lrm;<i>Thank you, Chloé Bourgeois. Next caller.</i>

07:05.200 --> 07:07.440
&lrm;<i>Hey! I'm not finished! Who gives you--</i>

07:07.560 --> 07:09.040
&lrm;<i>Hi, Ladybug and Cat Noir!</i>

07:09.160 --> 07:10.520
&lrm;<i>I'm Alya and wonder</i>

07:10.640 --> 07:12.680
&lrm;<i>if you'd grant me</i>
&lrm;<i>an interview for the Ladyblog,</i>

07:12.800 --> 07:14.640
&lrm;<i>since I have more viewers than Nadia!</i>

07:14.760 --> 07:18.240
&lrm;<i>-What do you say?</i>
&lrm;<i>-Uh... Yeah, sure, Alya.</i>

07:18.360 --> 07:20.920
&lrm;<i>-I'd love to do that.</i>
&lrm;<i>-That totally rocks!</i>

07:21.040 --> 07:23.200
&lrm;<i>-Thank you! Thank you!</i>
&lrm;<i>-I'm on TV?</i>

07:23.800 --> 07:26.560
&lrm;<i>-Mommy?</i>
&lrm;<i>-Manon? But where's Marinette?</i>

07:26.680 --> 07:30.480
&lrm;<i>-She had to go tell her parents something!</i>
&lrm;<i>-Yeah. It can take a while.</i>

07:30.600 --> 07:32.000
&lrm;What's going on, Nadia?

07:32.120 --> 07:34.840
&lrm;Is this some kind of joke?
&lrm;Just get to the scoop, now!

07:37.280 --> 07:40.960
&lrm;<i>Uh, Ladybug, Cat Noir...</i>
&lrm;<i>Um, so, a lot of fans think of you</i>

07:41.080 --> 07:42.400
&lrm;<i>as a couple of superheroes,</i>

07:42.520 --> 07:44.360
&lrm;<i>but also, and I quote,</i>

07:44.480 --> 07:46.200
&lrm;<i>as a "couple", period.</i>

07:46.320 --> 07:48.760
&lrm;<i>-What?</i>
&lrm;<i>-Can you confirm you're dating?</i>

07:49.640 --> 07:52.640
&lrm;<i>I'm very sorry, Nadia,</i>
&lrm;<i>but we're superheroes.</i>

07:52.760 --> 07:55.240
&lrm;<i>We're not here to answer</i>
&lrm;<i>such personal questions.</i>

07:55.360 --> 07:58.080
&lrm;<i>Miaow. My ladybug's growing claws!</i>

07:58.200 --> 08:00.640
&lrm;<i>We're here to assure</i>
&lrm;<i>all Parisians they're safe,</i>

08:00.760 --> 08:04.120
&lrm;<i>and it's only a matter of time</i>
&lrm;<i>before we defeat Hawk Moth. That's all.</i>

08:04.240 --> 08:07.120
&lrm;<i>-You told me you had an inside scoop!</i>
&lrm;<i>-Fine.</i>

08:07.240 --> 08:10.160
&lrm;<i>How do you explain these photographs,</i>
&lrm;<i>then?</i>

08:10.520 --> 08:12.440
&lrm;What? When did that happen?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.560
&lrm;I was saving you, not kissing you!

08:15.680 --> 08:17.400
&lrm;[Arlette]
&lrm;<i>Good job! Keep that up!</i>

08:27.200 --> 08:29.040
&lrm;<i>It's so obvious you're both in love!</i>

08:29.160 --> 08:32.039
&lrm;These are just a bunch of photos
&lrm;taken out of context!

08:32.159 --> 08:33.559
&lrm;We were only doing our job.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.799
&lrm;We save the city together every day!
&lrm;We're not a couple!

08:36.919 --> 08:39.559
&lrm;-But, hopefully, one day...
&lrm;-Cat! Not now!

08:39.679 --> 08:41.320
&lrm;Why won't you tell the truth?

08:41.679 --> 08:43.720
&lrm;But it is the truth, Nadia!

08:43.840 --> 08:46.600
&lrm;Come on, the audience awaits your answer.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.360
&lrm;This interview is so over.

08:49.480 --> 08:52.560
&lrm;-Whoa! What's the rush?
&lrm;-Uh... There's an alert!

08:52.680 --> 08:54.520
&lrm;Paris needs us right now!

08:54.640 --> 08:56.560
&lrm;Sorry! When duty calls... Gotta go!

08:56.680 --> 08:59.040
&lrm;<i>-Don't let them leave!</i>
&lrm;<i>-Hey! Wait, you two!</i>

08:59.160 --> 09:02.720
&lrm;<i>The show is not over yet!</i>
&lrm;<i>Your fans will be disappointed!</i>

09:02.840 --> 09:05.520
&lrm;<i>If they're our true fans,</i>
&lrm;<i>they'll understand!</i>

09:05.640 --> 09:07.240
&lrm;<i>The lady is right.</i>

09:08.760 --> 09:11.640
&lrm;<i>Beauty, comfort...</i>

09:13.920 --> 09:15.560
&lrm;Well, say bye-bye, Nadia.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.920
&lrm;This is officially your first
&lrm;and last primetime show!

09:23.760 --> 09:25.200
&lrm;[Nadia sobs]

09:28.240 --> 09:31.040
&lrm;A journalist ridiculed
&lrm;by Ladybug and Cat Noir,

09:31.160 --> 09:32.880
&lrm;now that's a perfect prey!

09:40.080 --> 09:44.160
&lrm;Fly away,
&lrm;my little akuma, and evilise her!

09:50.280 --> 09:52.440
&lrm;[Nadia sobs]

09:56.120 --> 09:58.480
&lrm;Prime Queen, I am Hawk Moth.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.440
&lrm;I see Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;have denied you the answers you deserve.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.240
&lrm;Steal their Miraculous
&lrm;and you will get your scoop!

10:05.760 --> 10:08.640
&lrm;The highest ratings will be mine!

10:16.960 --> 10:18.880
&lrm;-So, who are we saving?
&lrm;-Just us.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
&lrm;Nadia was willing to do anything
&lrm;for her show's success,

10:22.120 --> 10:24.600
&lrm;and I'm not about to answer
&lrm;any more questions!

10:24.720 --> 10:27.600
&lrm;But that's the price of success,
&lrm;the price of stardom!

10:27.720 --> 10:30.240
&lrm;We are superheroes, not stars!

10:30.360 --> 10:33.520
&lrm;We should be doing our job,
&lrm;not looking like fools on TV!

10:34.640 --> 10:37.160
&lrm;Wait!
&lrm;I wasn't planning to get home so early!

10:37.280 --> 10:41.120
&lrm;Why don't we get some ice cream?
&lrm;I know the purr-fect place.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.040
&lrm;<i>It's not possible.</i>

10:48.160 --> 10:50.640
&lrm;<i>She's a girl</i>
&lrm;<i>and she doesn't have a shampoo!</i>

10:50.760 --> 10:51.840
&lrm;<i>What the--</i>

10:51.960 --> 10:55.240
&lrm;Oh! My interview
&lrm;would have been so much better!

10:55.360 --> 11:00.560
&lrm;Why can't we see Mommy on TV any more?
&lrm;And where's Marinette?

11:00.680 --> 11:02.600
&lrm;[yawns]

11:02.720 --> 11:05.960
&lrm;I'm sure she'll be back soon.
&lrm;Before you can say--

11:06.080 --> 11:08.120
&lrm;[snores]

11:14.200 --> 11:18.840
&lrm;<i>Welcome, everyone, to a new show</i>
&lrm;<i>hosted by me, Prime Queen!</i>

11:18.960 --> 11:22.320
&lrm;<i>Ha, ha!</i>
&lrm;<i>Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>

11:22.440 --> 11:23.920
&lrm;Nadia?

11:24.040 --> 11:26.000
&lrm;[evil laugh]

11:26.120 --> 11:30.120
&lrm;<i>Tonight, Ladybug and Cat Noir</i>
&lrm;<i>disappointed all their loyal fans</i>

11:30.240 --> 11:33.280
&lrm;<i>by refusing to admit</i>
&lrm;<i>their love for one another!</i>

11:33.400 --> 11:36.360
&lrm;<i>I've prepared some trials</i>
&lrm;<i>to see how far they'll go</i>

11:36.480 --> 11:37.920
&lrm;<i>to keep the truth hidden from us!</i>

11:51.520 --> 11:54.040
&lrm;Hey! You're not allowed to come in here!

11:54.680 --> 11:56.480
&lrm;Security!

11:56.600 --> 12:00.200
&lrm;<i>Let's welcome our very first guest,</i>
&lrm;<i>Chloé Bourgeois,</i>

12:00.320 --> 12:03.200
&lrm;<i>who's apparently a friend</i>
&lrm;<i>of our two superheroes.</i>

12:03.320 --> 12:04.480
&lrm;<i>I certainly am.</i>

12:04.600 --> 12:06.960
&lrm;Just proves you can't believe
&lrm;what you see on TV!

12:07.080 --> 12:12.480
&lrm;Well, then, dear Chloé, let's find out
&lrm;if you can count on them as true friends!

12:21.480 --> 12:23.000
&lrm;[screaming]

12:24.840 --> 12:27.360
&lrm;Hey! Watch it!
&lrm;You're wrinkling my clothes!

12:27.480 --> 12:29.320
&lrm;Do you realise how much they cost?

12:32.080 --> 12:33.800
&lrm;[screams]

12:33.920 --> 12:35.760
&lrm;[gasps]

12:41.640 --> 12:44.840
&lrm;This can't be happening to me!
&lrm;I never, ever take the subway!

12:44.960 --> 12:47.200
&lrm;It's so... so not me!

12:47.320 --> 12:48.320
&lrm;Ugh! Gross!

12:48.440 --> 12:51.120
&lrm;<i>Welcome to the subway of suspense!</i>

12:51.240 --> 12:53.680
&lrm;<i>If it reaches 70 miles per hour,</i>

12:53.800 --> 12:56.800
&lrm;<i>you can say goodbye</i>
&lrm;<i>to your precious little friend!</i>

13:02.440 --> 13:05.520
&lrm;<i>Well, well, look here!</i>
&lrm;<i>The ratings are rising!</i>

13:05.640 --> 13:08.640
&lrm;<i>More and more of you want to know</i>
&lrm;<i>if our superhero friends</i>

13:08.760 --> 13:12.040
&lrm;<i>will get here in time!</i>
&lrm;<i>The suspense is</i>&lrm; killing&lrm;<i> her!</i>

13:12.160 --> 13:14.080
&lrm;[evil laugh]

13:14.200 --> 13:16.480
&lrm;<i>Ladybug, Cat Noir,</i>

13:16.600 --> 13:20.680
&lrm;<i>are you willing to travel through</i>
&lrm;<i>the screen to save your darling Chloé?</i>

13:20.800 --> 13:23.320
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir, I beg you,
&lrm;save my jacket!

13:31.920 --> 13:33.520
&lrm;Ready to take the leap, Milady?

13:33.640 --> 13:36.920
&lrm;What if it's a trap? I think
&lrm;I'd rather get there by my own means.

13:37.520 --> 13:41.240
&lrm;There are many subway lines in Paris,
&lrm;which means a 140 miles of rails!

13:41.360 --> 13:44.920
&lrm;If we want to get there in time
&lrm;to save Chloé, we have no choice.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.800
&lrm;-Ha! Just admit you love being on TV!
&lrm;-I don't get stage fright, Bugaboo!

13:56.560 --> 13:57.760
&lrm;[battle cry]

14:01.120 --> 14:03.040
&lrm;Finally! What took you so long?

14:03.160 --> 14:06.680
&lrm;Hurry up and get me out of this
&lrm;underground nightmare! Whoa! Ugh!

14:06.800 --> 14:08.320
&lrm;[evil laugh]

14:08.440 --> 14:12.280
&lrm;<i>You're about to be the stars of the</i>
&lrm;<i>highest-rated show in all of TV history!</i>

14:12.400 --> 14:15.280
&lrm;The akuma must be in that watch.
&lrm;I'll deal with Prime Queen.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.200
&lrm;I'll deal with the door!

14:23.600 --> 14:26.280
&lrm;-We're trapped!
&lrm;<i>-The rules for my show are simple.</i>

14:26.400 --> 14:28.160
&lrm;<i>Admit the truth, live on TV,</i>

14:28.280 --> 14:31.440
&lrm;<i>that you're dating and in love,</i>
&lrm;<i>and I'll stop the train!</i>

14:31.560 --> 14:35.320
&lrm;A superhero never lies! We won't admit
&lrm;to something that's not true!

14:35.600 --> 14:37.240
&lrm;<i>I want my scoop!</i>

14:37.360 --> 14:39.320
&lrm;-I'll use my Cataclysm!
&lrm;-No, wait!

14:39.440 --> 14:42.560
&lrm;-We might need it for an emergency.
&lrm;-Yeah. Like, right now!

14:42.680 --> 14:46.040
&lrm;We have to lure her over here first,
&lrm;or we'll never capture her akuma.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.280
&lrm;So let's just play along with her.
&lrm;It'll buy us some time.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.520
&lrm;-Meaning?
&lrm;-OK, Prime Queen.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.520
&lrm;You win. I confess.

14:53.640 --> 14:58.960
&lrm;Cat Noir and I&lrm;<i> are</i>&lrm; dating, like you said!
&lrm;We are in love.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.520
&lrm;[purring]

15:06.640 --> 15:09.520
&lrm;-Did I just hear you purr?
&lrm;-Uh... No way!

15:09.640 --> 15:12.600
&lrm;<i>Our two heroic lovebirds</i>
&lrm;<i>are saving their fan's life</i>

15:12.720 --> 15:14.680
&lrm;<i>by admitting their true feelings!</i>

15:14.800 --> 15:16.920
&lrm;<i>Our viewers are going crazy!</i>

15:17.040 --> 15:19.640
&lrm;<i>But the TV ratings haven't maxed out yet.</i>

15:19.880 --> 15:21.240
&lrm;<i>You must do better!</i>

15:21.360 --> 15:23.320
&lrm;<i>Then come and join us, Prime Queen!</i>

15:23.440 --> 15:27.040
&lrm;<i>You're the host and star of the show.</i>
&lrm;<i>Then you'll have your ratings!</i>

15:28.000 --> 15:30.080
&lrm;Order them to give you their Miraculous!

15:30.200 --> 15:32.640
&lrm;<i>My show, my rules, Ladybug!</i>

15:32.760 --> 15:36.480
&lrm;<i>To prove your feelings are genuine,</i>
&lrm;<i>you'll have to take off your masks!</i>

15:36.600 --> 15:39.880
&lrm;<i>Which means</i>
&lrm;<i>you must both give me your Miraculous!</i>

15:40.000 --> 15:42.440
&lrm;-Not a chance, Prime Queen!
&lrm;-Wait!

15:42.560 --> 15:44.520
&lrm;I know how we can prove our feelings!

15:47.320 --> 15:48.960
&lrm;Pucker up!

15:50.200 --> 15:52.400
&lrm;Not a chance, Kitty!

15:55.360 --> 15:57.200
&lrm;Is the show over?

15:57.320 --> 16:00.320
&lrm;If we can't get to her,
&lrm;we'll never capture her akuma!

16:00.920 --> 16:04.800
&lrm;<i>My dear viewers,</i>
&lrm;<i>you're in for the reveal of a lifetime!</i>

16:04.920 --> 16:06.760
&lrm;[evil laugh]

16:06.880 --> 16:09.280
&lrm;<i>Ladybug! Help me, please!</i>

16:09.400 --> 16:13.120
&lrm;<i>Oh, wait! Isn't this the girl</i>
&lrm;<i>who started the famous Ladyblog?</i>

16:13.240 --> 16:17.080
&lrm;<i>-The first one who ever filmed Ladybug?</i>
&lrm;-No! Alya!

16:17.680 --> 16:22.160
&lrm;<i>Next trial, your Miraculous, or else</i>
&lrm;<i>your biggest fan will be mummified!</i>

16:22.280 --> 16:24.040
&lrm;[evil laugh]

16:25.520 --> 16:27.200
&lrm;Let's leap in before she runs!

16:30.000 --> 16:33.640
&lrm;Hey! Oh! Wait! What about me?
&lrm;Someone get me out of here!

16:38.240 --> 16:40.680
&lrm;-We're not at the Louvre!
&lrm;-It was a double-cross!

16:41.880 --> 16:43.320
&lrm;[evil laugh]

16:44.960 --> 16:46.760
&lrm;-Cataclysm?
&lrm;-There's no point.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.440
&lrm;We're far away from the Louvre.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.880
&lrm;By the time we get there,
&lrm;it'll be too late!

16:51.360 --> 16:52.880
&lrm;So, a kiss then?

16:54.400 --> 16:56.440
&lrm;Still not a chance, Cat Noir!

16:56.560 --> 16:59.880
&lrm;<i>The time has come</i>
&lrm;<i>to push those ratings sky high!</i>

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
&lrm;<i>Let's try again.</i>

17:01.120 --> 17:04.160
&lrm;<i>Remove your Miraculous</i>
&lrm;<i>and reveal your true selves.</i>

17:04.280 --> 17:05.800
&lrm;<i>The whole world is watching you!</i>

17:05.920 --> 17:08.839
&lrm;The perfect plan, Prime Queen!
&lrm;They're cornered!

17:08.960 --> 17:11.280
&lrm;The Miraculous are mine!

17:11.839 --> 17:14.760
&lrm;There's no use looking for a way out...

17:15.200 --> 17:17.640
&lrm;unless you want to see
&lrm;your fan in deep water!

17:19.680 --> 17:20.760
&lrm;[gasp]

17:27.280 --> 17:28.520
&lrm;<i>Hurry up, you two.</i>

17:28.640 --> 17:31.240
&lrm;<i>Don't wanna keep your audience waiting!</i>

17:32.920 --> 17:34.000
&lrm;You're right!

17:34.800 --> 17:36.680
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

17:41.720 --> 17:43.960
&lrm;A tape roll?
&lrm;What am I supposed to do with this?

17:52.800 --> 17:54.320
&lrm;Of course!

17:56.880 --> 17:59.440
&lrm;-Hurry! She's about to push Alya in!
&lrm;-One minute!

17:59.560 --> 18:01.560
&lrm;-That's too long!
&lrm;<i>-Listen to the cat!</i>

18:07.840 --> 18:08.800
&lrm;Voilà!

18:16.760 --> 18:20.400
&lrm;-What's happening?
&lrm;-Fine. You win, Prime Queen!

18:20.520 --> 18:22.240
&lrm;<i>We'll remove our Miraculous.</i>

18:22.360 --> 18:24.400
&lrm;<i>Everyone will see us without our masks!</i>

18:24.520 --> 18:27.200
&lrm;<i>And we're about to kiss!</i>
&lrm;<i>Shame you're missing it!</i>

18:27.320 --> 18:29.200
&lrm;So unlucky!

18:32.440 --> 18:34.960
&lrm;<i>If you're lying,</i>
&lrm;<i>you're going to regret it!</i>

18:39.200 --> 18:40.640
&lrm;And now you're stuck with us.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.520
&lrm;Cataclysm!

19:03.400 --> 19:05.200
&lrm;-Ladies first.
&lrm;-Thank you.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.760
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

19:11.600 --> 19:13.840
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

19:17.360 --> 19:18.880
&lrm;Gotcha!

19:19.000 --> 19:21.240
&lrm;Bye, little butterfly!

19:21.360 --> 19:23.760
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:33.800 --> 19:35.560
&lrm;What just happened?

19:35.680 --> 19:37.000
&lrm;Pound it!

19:37.640 --> 19:39.920
&lrm;Prime Queen turned out to be bad news!

19:40.040 --> 19:44.760
&lrm;But, soon, I'll be broadcasting
&lrm;the end of Ladybug and Cat Noir!

19:52.000 --> 19:53.720
&lrm;I'm so sorry, Alya!

19:53.840 --> 19:56.480
&lrm;I had no idea it would take so long
&lrm;to talk to my parents!

19:56.600 --> 19:59.840
&lrm;You won't believe it!
&lrm;I was taken hostage by a supervillain!

19:59.960 --> 20:01.480
&lrm;What? You're kidding!

20:01.600 --> 20:03.240
&lrm;No joke! You missed everything!

20:03.360 --> 20:05.920
&lrm;Luckily, Ladybug saved me!

20:06.520 --> 20:08.600
&lrm;I'm so sorry I wasn't here for you.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.840
&lrm;No biggie! But next time
&lrm;we decide to spend an evening together,

20:11.960 --> 20:14.320
&lrm;you're not allowed to go
&lrm;near your parents!

20:14.440 --> 20:15.440
&lrm;Deal!

20:19.400 --> 20:21.360
&lrm;<i>Don't be bemused, it's just the news!</i>

20:21.480 --> 20:24.800
&lrm;<i>Hi, I'm Nadia Chamack,</i>
&lrm;<i>and this Side-by-Side!</i>

20:24.920 --> 20:28.600
&lrm;<i>Today, I'm joined by Alya Césaire,</i>
&lrm;<i>who created the Ladyblog!</i>

20:28.720 --> 20:32.560
&lrm;<i>Together, we'll be looking back over</i>
&lrm;<i>Cat Noir and Ladybug's greatest feats!</i>

20:32.920 --> 20:35.600
&lrm;<i>Your ratings are really high,</i>
&lrm;<i>Nadia, great job!</i>

20:35.720 --> 20:38.280
&lrm;You've earned this primetime show!

20:38.560 --> 20:40.520
&lrm;<i>Hello, Nadia! Hey, fans!</i>

20:40.640 --> 20:43.080
&lrm;<i>So, first of all,</i>
&lrm;<i>I gotta set the record straight.</i>

20:43.200 --> 20:45.640
&lrm;<i>Cat Noir and Ladybug are not a couple!</i>

20:45.760 --> 20:48.880
&lrm;<i>Well, not yet, at least.</i>
&lrm;<i>Sorry to break the news!</i>

20:49.000 --> 20:53.040
&lrm;-Hey, look! That's you with my mommy!
&lrm;-That's right, small fry!

20:53.160 --> 20:56.280
&lrm;Well done! Now everyone's
&lrm;gonna know about the Ladyblog!

20:56.400 --> 20:59.040
&lrm;-You want an autograph?
&lrm;-Of course!

20:59.160 --> 21:00.760
&lrm;Oh, me first, me first!

21:01.320 --> 21:03.880
&lrm;[laughters]
