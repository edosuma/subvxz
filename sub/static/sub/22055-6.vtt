06:31.183 --> 06:31.977
[laughs]

06:32.081 --> 06:33.047
OK, let's go.

06:33.151 --> 06:34.877
Milly picks me
and I think he's

06:34.980 --> 06:36.430
curious to see what I can do.

06:36.534 --> 06:39.364
This is his way to feel me out.

Spin it around.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.091

Oh, interesting.

06:47.614 --> 06:48.649

06:48.753 --> 06:50.996
I'm a little worried
about Milly and Jennifer

06:51.100 --> 06:53.413
because nothing from
Morocco screams, "Hey!

06:53.516 --> 06:55.311
Put me on a fucking pizza."

06:55.415 --> 06:59.039
Feisty Manda who do

06:59.142 --> 07:02.180
Um, I'm going

07:02.283 --> 07:03.492
because he's given me the eye.

07:03.595 --> 07:04.631
[laughter]

07:04.734 --> 07:07.116
Van is like giving me
this super creepy look

07:07.219 --> 07:09.221

him down right now.

07:09.325 --> 07:10.119
Off you go.

07:13.363 --> 07:15.296
Oh, Vietnam!

07:15.400 --> 07:16.781

07:27.619 --> 07:29.483
No one on the blue teampicks me to go up against.

07:29.587 --> 07:31.658
I'm pretty sure it's
because they're scared.

07:31.761 --> 07:33.004
You look nervous Nick.

07:33.107 --> 07:34.523
- Go, Nick, go, go, go.

07:36.628 --> 07:37.491
GORDON RAMSAY: She's feisty.

07:37.595 --> 07:38.492
There you go.

07:38.596 --> 07:41.046
It is-- it's going on Greece.

07:41.150 --> 07:42.323
It is.

07:42.427 --> 07:45.844
Yes, Greece, oh my God,
I can work with this.

07:45.948 --> 07:47.639
It's something
I've cooked before

07:47.743 --> 07:49.434
so this is going to be easy.

07:49.538 --> 07:51.263
GORDON RAMSAY: Ah, Michellewho do you want to take down?

07:51.367 --> 07:53.024

07:53.127 --> 07:54.853
Ah, Benjamin, Chef.

07:54.957 --> 07:56.165
GORDON RAMSAY: But why not Gio?

07:56.268 --> 07:58.719
Ah, I just feel like I wantto go up against the best

07:58.823 --> 08:00.618

08:02.205 --> 08:03.034

08:11.870 --> 08:14.321
GORDON RAMSEY: Now everybody'spaired up except for Gio.

08:14.424 --> 08:21.121
You get to join one of thosepairings and do a second pizza.

08:21.224 --> 08:22.018
I'll do French.

08:22.122 --> 08:23.399
GORDON RAMSAY: French.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.987
I chose France because Ithink Michelle disrespected me.

08:25.090 --> 08:26.885
If she wanted to go againstthe best pizza maker

08:26.989 --> 08:28.611
she should've picked at
least an Italian guy.

08:28.715 --> 08:30.820
So I'm looking forward
to kicking her ass.

08:30.924 --> 08:34.686
You have 30 minutesand your time starts now.

08:34.790 --> 08:35.584
Let's go.

08:35.687 --> 08:36.964

08:37.068 --> 08:37.896

08:38.966 --> 08:40.243

08:40.347 --> 08:43.695
It's not too difficult tofind a paring for French food.

[interposing voices]

08:45.732 --> 08:46.664
Y'all is one is on that side.

08:46.767 --> 08:47.734

08:47.837 --> 08:49.667

08:49.770 --> 08:51.358
- Y'all see butter?- Did you get green onions?

08:51.461 --> 08:52.911

08:53.015 --> 08:54.499

08:54.603 --> 08:57.985
Everyone's grabbingingredients and out of control.

08:58.089 --> 09:00.954
Get out of my way.

09:01.057 --> 09:02.714
It is utter chaos.

09:02.818 --> 09:04.716
Don't touch my pan.

09:04.820 --> 09:06.131
GIOVANNI: Don't, I'm trying.

09:06.235 --> 09:08.582
It's a tight kitchen, howabout showing some class?

09:08.686 --> 09:11.240
Does anyone see the top
of the food processor?

09:11.343 --> 09:12.897
This is ridiculous.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.726
Gio, it ain't coming off, bro.

09:15.727 --> 09:16.935
Pull it out!
- Gio?

09:17.039 --> 09:17.867
Put it right here.

09:17.971 --> 09:20.007
MILLY: I need a
pan, Gio, please?

09:20.111 --> 09:21.422
Help me out Gio?

09:21.526 --> 09:22.562
Hold on one second man.

09:22.665 --> 09:23.839
There's a lot of
people asking my help

09:23.942 --> 09:25.254
and I'm trying to
focus on my pizza cos

09:25.357 --> 09:27.532
if I fuck up my pizza they'llbe throwing me under the bus.

09:27.636 --> 09:28.464
Who's pizza in the oven.

09:31.053 --> 09:32.433
Just under 20
minutes to go guys.

09:32.537 --> 09:33.503
Where's a rolling pin?

09:33.607 --> 09:34.953
Did you roll it out?

09:35.057 --> 09:38.923
My country's India and I'm like,OK, grab masala tomato sauce,

09:43.168 --> 09:44.238
I think this is
going to sound good.

09:44.342 --> 09:45.136

09:54.041 --> 09:56.216

09:56.319 --> 09:57.631
GORDON RAMSAY: Last
two minutes guys.

09:57.735 --> 09:59.633
They take 90 seconds to cook.

09:59.737 --> 10:03.533
Time is running out andthe wheels start to come off.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.294
Watch each other's faces.

10:05.397 --> 10:08.642
There's just so much chaos andconfusion going on right now.

10:08.746 --> 10:10.195
Spinning it's hot.

10:10.299 --> 10:11.162

11:07.390 --> 11:08.219
Keep it together girl.

[laughs]

11:25.546 --> 11:29.481
Blue team, you have twopizzas representing France.

11:29.585 --> 11:30.897
I'll only be tasting one.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.933
Decide which pizza is your best.

11:33.037 --> 11:34.072
Um, what do you

11:34.176 --> 11:35.660

11:37.248 --> 11:38.974
[interposing voices]

11:39.077 --> 11:41.942
Just looking at it, I'drather have Giovanni's pizza.

11:42.046 --> 11:44.773
And we're all like, Oh we gotthis his name is Giovanni.

11:44.876 --> 11:47.085
You can't get more
Italian than that.

11:47.189 --> 11:49.674
Now Marino and I will bejudging your pizzas today,

11:49.778 --> 11:52.919
but I've also added a
very important judge.

11:53.022 --> 11:54.783
Los Angeles Magazine
named this guy

11:54.886 --> 11:56.646
one of the chefs of the year.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.994
Please welcome, Steve Samson.

11:59.097 --> 12:01.444
[applause]

12:01.548 --> 12:03.170
GORDON RAMSAY: Steve.

12:03.274 --> 12:06.001
I'm definitely excited tohave Steve Samson as a judge.

12:06.104 --> 12:09.590
He's got one of the best pizzarestaurants in the world.

12:09.694 --> 12:13.491
Let's begin with
the battle of India.

12:13.594 --> 12:14.734
Robyn and Barbie.

12:14.837 --> 12:16.011
DANA: Come on, Barbie!

12:16.114 --> 12:17.875
GORDON RAMSAY: So, Barbie,describe your pizza first

12:17.978 --> 12:19.083
please?

12:19.186 --> 12:21.741
I made a twist on whitepizza, with mango chutney,

12:21.844 --> 12:24.226
and Vrindavan roasted mushrooms.

12:24.329 --> 12:26.573
It's a little bit dry,
but I do like the fact

12:26.676 --> 12:28.161
that it tastes very Indian.

12:28.264 --> 12:29.231
It's a good effort.

12:29.334 --> 12:30.784
Right, Robyn, describe
your pizza place?

12:30.888 --> 12:33.131
So I did a garam
masala tomato sauce.

12:33.235 --> 12:34.615
I took [inaudible]
meat chicken, I

12:34.719 --> 12:35.858
marinated that
with coconut milk,

12:35.962 --> 12:37.135
and a little bit of turmeric.

12:37.239 --> 12:39.275
Put on some eggplant and a[inaudible] cheese on top.

12:39.379 --> 12:40.725
Did that go on
early that eggplant

12:40.829 --> 12:43.728
because it's still
quite spongy here?

12:43.832 --> 12:45.834
No, I put it in the
tomato sauce with it.

12:45.937 --> 12:46.696
Raw?

12:46.800 --> 12:47.836
Yes, Chef.

12:47.939 --> 12:49.803
Raw eggplant, yeah, I'm
not a big lover of that.

12:49.907 --> 12:51.011
It's got that bitter taste.

12:51.115 --> 12:52.737
You might have struggleda little with the oven.

12:52.841 --> 12:55.775
Ovens run very hot, muchhotter than conventional ovens.

12:55.878 --> 12:57.017
So I can see that.

12:57.121 --> 12:59.468
So gentlemen can we
count to three please?

12:59.571 --> 13:02.264
1, 2, 3.

13:02.367 --> 13:03.610
Whoa!

13:03.713 --> 13:04.507
[buzzer dings]

13:04.611 --> 13:05.612
It feels amazing to win.

13:05.715 --> 13:09.581

point, thanks Robyn.

13:09.685 --> 13:12.999
Right next let's do thebattle of Morocco, please.

13:13.102 --> 13:14.863
I'm a little nervous
but when I look over

13:14.966 --> 13:16.761
at Jennifer's pizza,
like, you really

13:16.865 --> 13:19.108

13:19.212 --> 13:21.386

lamb and arugula pizza--

13:27.427 --> 13:29.809
I probably would haveliked maybe a little bit more

13:29.912 --> 13:30.913
of the sweet component.

13:31.017 --> 13:32.156
Yes.

13:32.259 --> 13:33.709
Authentic great spiceespecially with the raisins

Very nice.

13:39.542 --> 13:40.889
A little dry.

13:40.992 --> 13:43.546
Maybe having like a little bitof some sauce or something wet.

13:43.650 --> 13:46.756
Gents, please vote for
your best tasting pizza.

13:46.860 --> 13:51.037

you gone for there?

14:03.670 --> 14:04.947
What is that a football?

14:05.051 --> 14:06.742
Oh, Chef, it was a mess.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.261
I was down to the last second.

14:08.364 --> 14:10.228
I think maybe he wanted
to replicate the shape

14:10.332 --> 14:11.126
of the state of Texas.

14:11.229 --> 14:12.230
[laughter]

14:12.334 --> 14:13.991
NARRATOR: With the
score tied one-to-one,

14:14.094 --> 14:17.304
Van is hoping the judges canlook past the shape of his banh

14:17.408 --> 14:19.272
mi inspired Vietnamese pizza--

14:19.375 --> 14:21.101
The flavor here
is mind blowing.

14:21.205 --> 14:22.033
Mm-hmm.

14:22.137 --> 14:23.069
The shrimp are beautiful.

14:23.172 --> 14:24.794
It's just in the
baking and shaping

14:24.898 --> 14:26.210
of the pizza but good job.

14:26.313 --> 14:27.832

14:43.365 --> 14:46.609
I just beat Van, so I cannot be happier right now.

14:46.713 --> 14:47.783
He creeped me out.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.784
I didn't know what else to do.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.890
Let's go, Dana

14:52.857 --> 14:55.273

NARRATOR: --leaving
Jared and Elise

15:22.576 --> 15:25.476
to battle it out with theirKorean inspired pizzas.

15:25.579 --> 15:27.512
Did you guys eat
half of this one?

15:27.616 --> 15:30.964
Um, yes chef,
it's a flat bread.

15:31.068 --> 15:32.138
Challenges pizza.

15:32.241 --> 15:33.967
It's ugly, I'm sorry, Chef.

15:34.071 --> 15:35.658
Somewhat left to be desired.

15:35.762 --> 15:36.590
The flavors are good.

15:36.694 --> 15:37.660
They're well-balanced.

15:37.764 --> 15:38.903
I like the meat, I
like the vegetables.

15:39.007 --> 15:40.491
All the makings of
a great pizza there.

15:40.594 --> 15:42.148
Just badly put together.

15:42.251 --> 15:43.977
Elise, if you blew thischallenge for the red team,

15:44.081 --> 15:46.946
I swear to God you're notgoing to hear the end of it.

15:47.049 --> 15:48.844
Jared, describe
the pizza please?

15:48.948 --> 15:51.881
Um, I topped it with someshrimp, with raw cabbage,

15:51.985 --> 15:53.883
to emulate that kimchi flavor.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.093
Raw cabbage in the enddoesn't sound that inspiring.

15:56.196 --> 15:58.026
Um, think cheese,
not raw cabbage.

15:58.129 --> 16:00.028
I have no one to award
a point to on this one.

16:00.131 --> 16:01.305
Ah, Marino?

16:01.408 --> 16:02.823
I'll pass.

16:02.927 --> 16:03.790
Wow, Steve?

16:03.893 --> 16:05.965
I think I have to as well.

16:06.068 --> 16:08.553
I'm sure that if I hadthe whole pizza on the plate

16:08.657 --> 16:09.969
I would have won that round.

16:10.072 --> 16:13.869
But technically, I didn't losea point for my team so whatever.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.389
We're tied and it's all downto the battle of the French,

16:16.492 --> 16:17.286
let's go.

16:17.390 --> 16:18.460
[applause]

16:18.563 --> 16:20.876
It coming down to
Gio and as a team

16:20.980 --> 16:23.983
we picked Gio's
pizza over Benjamin.

16:24.086 --> 16:25.674
We'd better have
this one in the bag.

16:25.777 --> 16:26.778
Michelle?

16:26.882 --> 16:28.332
Sliced brie on there,
with a little bit

16:28.435 --> 16:29.989
of blistered tomatoes,
crunchy Brussels

16:30.092 --> 16:31.956
sprouts and toasted prosciutto.

16:32.060 --> 16:33.647
Maybe a little more
utilization of the dough

16:33.751 --> 16:35.270
is quite a lot of
dough exposed here.

16:35.373 --> 16:36.271
STEVE SAMSON: Mm-hmm.
GORDON RAMSAY: Good job.

16:36.374 --> 16:37.168
Thank you, Chef.

16:37.272 --> 16:38.825
Right, Gio, describe please.

16:38.928 --> 16:40.344
I did a classic
on a white pie.

16:40.447 --> 16:42.760
I took the cr me fraiche addedsome shallots, some garlic,

16:42.863 --> 16:44.003
a little Herbes de Provence.

16:44.106 --> 16:45.107
Oh, dear.

16:45.211 --> 16:46.729
Could you just flip
that over for me please?

16:46.833 --> 16:47.627
Yeah.

16:47.730 --> 16:48.524
No.

16:48.628 --> 16:49.939
GORDON RAMSEY: Jesus.

16:50.043 --> 16:50.871
Wow!

16:50.975 --> 16:53.219
See visually every
slice was burnt.

16:53.322 --> 16:54.185
You had no idea it was burnt?

16:54.289 --> 16:55.221
No, I didn't.

16:55.324 --> 16:56.118
Fuck!

16:56.222 --> 16:57.671
Rookie, rookie mistake.

16:57.775 --> 16:58.948
- The flavors are good.
- Delicious.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.157
Just-- you know.

17:00.260 --> 17:04.299
Another great concept,but badly, badly executed.

17:04.402 --> 17:06.784
He probably should
pick mine over Gio's.

17:06.887 --> 17:11.858
Right, gentlemen, on the countof three-- one, two, three.

17:11.961 --> 17:12.824
[cheering]

17:12.928 --> 17:14.723
[buzzer ding]

17:14.826 --> 17:16.345
Blue team, do you have
any idea that was burnt?

17:16.449 --> 17:17.519
No, Chef.

17:17.622 --> 17:19.762
No, wow, if only you
had looked underneath.

17:19.866 --> 17:20.901
That's the one
thing I didn't do

17:21.005 --> 17:22.524
was check the
bottom of the pizza,

17:22.627 --> 17:24.008
but the team picked my pizza.

17:24.112 --> 17:25.768
So they also better
take a small percentage

17:25.872 --> 17:26.942
of this fucking bullshit.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.771
Now, all of you
join me in thanking

17:28.875 --> 17:30.325
Steve to be here this morning.

17:30.428 --> 17:31.222

17:31.326 --> 17:33.155
Thank you.

17:33.259 --> 17:34.225
Good job.

17:34.329 --> 17:37.228

17:50.483 --> 17:52.140
and see some exciting places.

17:52.243 --> 17:53.037

17:53.141 --> 17:53.934

18:00.527 --> 18:03.668
Tonight is Italian
night in Hell's Kitchen.

18:03.772 --> 18:07.672
And that means you aretransforming the dining room

18:07.776 --> 18:09.364
ahead of tonight's occasion.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.504
The tablecloths need to
be beautifully ironed.

18:11.607 --> 18:12.781
Tables need to be set.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.610
Don't forget the littlecondiments, the oil, vinegar.

18:14.714 --> 18:16.405
I want to see freshly gratedParmesan on all the tables

18:16.509 --> 18:17.337
as well.

18:17.441 --> 18:18.407
Yes, Chef.

18:18.511 --> 18:19.719
You can start now, let's go.

18:19.822 --> 18:20.789
This sucks.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.309
This is the second
time I've had to set

18:23.412 --> 18:24.620
Hell's Kitchen dining room.

18:24.724 --> 18:25.863
It's horrible.

18:25.966 --> 18:27.278
I feel like the
red team would be

18:27.382 --> 18:31.248
a little bit better at thisthan a bunch of dudes and Robyn.

18:31.351 --> 18:33.698
DANA: Good job girls!

18:33.802 --> 18:35.183

ball gown again.

Look at you, you look likea star with your sparkly dress

18:42.811 --> 18:44.088

18:44.192 --> 18:46.677

18:46.780 --> 18:48.196
You know we all

18:48.299 --> 18:49.300
Oh, look!

19:07.387 --> 19:08.319

19:08.423 --> 19:10.114
The red team's not
fighting for once,

19:10.218 --> 19:11.288
we're all getting along.

19:11.391 --> 19:14.532
This is like a once in
a lifetime experience.

19:14.636 --> 19:17.225
It's amazing.

19:17.328 --> 19:19.710
So tonight is aspecial night for me, OK.

19:19.813 --> 19:21.021
It's Italian night.

Behind you, you have everythingthat you need to reset

19:23.265 --> 19:24.335
the room, so get to it.

19:24.439 --> 19:25.233
OK, Marino.

19:25.336 --> 19:28.753
Fine tables, prego.

19:28.857 --> 19:31.687
Check if you have a roundone, not the rectangular.

19:31.791 --> 19:33.448
I just assumed but--

19:33.551 --> 19:34.587
Never assume.

19:34.690 --> 19:36.451
Yeah, I learned that
today with Gio's pizza.

19:36.554 --> 19:37.831
Oh, snap.

19:37.935 --> 19:38.763
MILLY: Oh!

19:38.867 --> 19:41.904

19:44.183 --> 19:45.736
the bottom of my fucking pizza.

19:45.839 --> 19:46.737
So fuck them all.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.773
Chicks at a magic show.

All right, do

20:11.037 --> 20:14.696
I want you to pinch your
ring through the cloth.

20:14.799 --> 20:15.938

20:16.042 --> 20:17.423
it's going to end up there.- [laughs] Yeah, right.

20:17.526 --> 20:19.114

20:30.470 --> 20:32.300
That's just a little joke,Elise, that was a quarter.

20:32.403 --> 20:33.197
That's just a little joke.

20:33.301 --> 20:34.509
It's all good.

20:34.612 --> 20:36.994
Elise, calm down, you'regoing to get your ring back.

20:37.097 --> 20:38.064
Do you play tennis at all?

20:38.167 --> 20:39.065
No.

This is the best
day of my life.

20:49.903 --> 20:51.836
I like seeing Elise panic.

20:51.940 --> 20:53.010
I think it's funny.

20:53.113 --> 20:54.183
[laughs]

Brand new fresh can.

21:05.436 --> 21:06.679

is grateful to have

21:22.729 --> 21:23.903

21:26.112 --> 21:27.700
NARRATOR: --the
punishment is definitely

21:27.803 --> 21:30.910

I'm done.

21:32.877 --> 21:34.223
[laughter]

21:34.327 --> 21:38.158
Angry and a wheel of cheese,that's like going to prison.

21:38.262 --> 21:41.127
You never see the end of thatshit, you just grate and grate

21:41.230 --> 21:43.163

21:43.267 --> 21:44.337
DANA: Hey, guys.

Yeah.

21:47.547 --> 21:48.479

21:48.583 --> 21:49.756
She got married in
that to her husband.

21:49.860 --> 21:50.792

I am not letting celiac
disease take me down.

I know.

26:02.181 --> 26:03.113
But what can you do then?

26:03.216 --> 26:04.252
I asked somebody
to taste it from me.

26:04.355 --> 26:05.494
So who did you ask
to taste so I can

26:05.598 --> 26:06.979
help out eliminate that palate?

26:07.082 --> 26:09.188
Chef, I said 30 moreseconds when she asked me.

And did she cook
it 30 more seconds?

26:10.534 --> 26:11.328
Yes.

26:11.431 --> 26:12.605
I wasn't sure, Chef.

able to do it too.

30:15.537 --> 30:17.263
keep like moving,moving, moving, because I

30:17.367 --> 30:18.540

30:18.644 --> 30:19.887
I don't want to
fuck anything up.

30:19.990 --> 30:21.233
I want to make sure

30:21.336 --> 30:22.441

Oh my God, she was like splat.

30:33.245 --> 30:34.487

30:34.591 --> 30:36.973
This is karma
for the raw pasta.

30:37.076 --> 30:38.388

30:38.491 --> 30:41.909

You ready?

30:56.302 --> 30:57.200
Go to the pass.

30:57.303 --> 30:58.097
I'm not ready.

30:58.201 --> 30:59.547
Now, I can go in one minute.

30:59.650 --> 31:02.136
NARRATOR: --Jared isunder pressure to deliver.

31:02.239 --> 31:03.068
One minute still.

31:03.171 --> 31:04.207
Come on, right
now is the time.

31:04.310 --> 31:05.484
We've got to get it out.

31:05.587 --> 31:07.451
There's a fuck ton goingon in the garnish station.

timing to match my fish.

31:24.261 --> 31:25.642

31:25.745 --> 31:27.195
The communication
issue right now

is Jared lying,
like he's literally

31:29.335 --> 31:31.924
lying to us on how longthe garnish is going to be.

32:11.619 --> 32:12.689
What's happening, buddy?

32:12.792 --> 32:14.587
I just need a
band-aid real quick.

32:14.691 --> 32:16.175
Did you see that cut?

32:16.279 --> 32:17.245
Was it bleeding to death?

32:17.349 --> 32:18.212
No, Chef.

32:18.315 --> 32:20.386
Because it wasn't
fucking there.

Well, what is it?

33:52.685 --> 33:54.515
I look at this, I go
back the opening night.

33:54.618 --> 33:56.517
It's like two
different brigades.

[dramatic music playing]

34:10.324 --> 34:11.808
[indistinct conversation]

34:11.911 --> 34:13.499

I didn't see the cut.

34:31.517 --> 34:33.071

Professional medic can'teven find a fucking cut.

34:35.314 --> 34:36.419
Get out.

34:36.522 --> 34:38.179

seen in my entire fucking life.

34:40.802 --> 34:41.596
Get out.

34:44.289 --> 34:46.084
It was a nightmare tonight.

34:46.187 --> 34:48.016
And all I could do
was smile about it

34:48.120 --> 34:51.744
but can't do that
in Hell's Kitchen.

34:51.848 --> 34:54.609
All right, the
blue kitchen's gone.

34:54.713 --> 34:57.888
[sighs] The entire
blue team is missing.

34:57.992 --> 35:00.408

Yes, Chef.

35:02.341 --> 35:03.446
Come here.

35:03.549 --> 35:04.792
They were a disaster.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.242
Not just in the
middle, not at the end,

35:06.345 --> 35:07.829
not even at the
beginning and then,

35:07.933 --> 35:10.280
Van, laughing his
head off, I'm done.

35:10.384 --> 35:11.178
Upstairs.

I'm walking with salmon.

35:25.433 --> 35:26.365
Walking with New York.

35:26.469 --> 35:28.816
Right behind, right behind.

35:28.919 --> 35:29.713
Ladies?

35:29.817 --> 35:30.611
Beautifully cooked!

35:30.714 --> 35:31.612
Thank you, Chef.

35:31.715 --> 35:32.509
Service please.

35:39.033 --> 35:40.414
This food is yummy.

35:40.517 --> 35:41.380
Good job, ladies.

35:45.971 --> 35:48.284
Fuck!

35:48.387 --> 35:49.250
[laughs]

35:49.354 --> 35:50.355
Yeah, I don't
like getting kicked

35:50.458 --> 35:52.184
out of a fucking kitchen.

35:52.288 --> 35:54.531
You shouldn't have
called the medic.

35:54.635 --> 35:56.326
I shouldn't have calledfor a medic, I should have--

35:56.430 --> 35:57.776
I should have done
a lot of things.

35:57.879 --> 36:00.848
Hindsight, you know, is 20/20., Listen I know I fucked up,

36:00.951 --> 36:02.194
but I'm going to defend myself.

36:02.298 --> 36:04.783
There's other people to blame.

36:04.886 --> 36:07.303
Bad service, terrible service.

36:07.406 --> 36:08.545
Do you want to just start?

36:08.649 --> 36:10.237
Give me the lowdown becauseI only saw some stuff.

36:10.340 --> 36:14.344
So, Van and Gio, they hadlamb go up that was raw.

36:14.448 --> 36:16.070
All right, what did--
what did Robyn do?

36:16.174 --> 36:17.209
That was salmon
that came back.

36:17.313 --> 36:18.106
The scallop dish?

36:18.210 --> 36:19.211
The scallops.

36:19.315 --> 36:21.351
I recovered 30 seconds
after that scallop.

36:21.455 --> 36:23.215
Who put up that
lamb, that raw lamb?

36:23.319 --> 36:25.735
We both did.

36:25.838 --> 36:27.530
Who walk it to the pass?

36:27.633 --> 36:29.014
I think I did.

36:29.117 --> 36:30.429
I'm gonna keep
it real with you.

36:30.533 --> 36:32.742
If you take raw to the pass, I'malways going to vote for raw.

36:32.845 --> 36:35.469
I'm going to vote, Van.

36:35.572 --> 36:38.230
Number one sin in the
kitchen is raw food.

36:38.334 --> 36:40.198
I don't care how good
you are, you put out

36:40.301 --> 36:43.580
raw food I'm saying your name.

36:43.684 --> 36:45.651
Based off what Chef Ramsaytold me on the way up here,

36:45.755 --> 36:46.721
it would be Van.

36:46.825 --> 36:47.757
That's my vote.

36:47.860 --> 36:49.172
I ain't ready to go home yet.

36:49.276 --> 36:52.313
If there's one thing Ifucking know is I can cook.

36:52.417 --> 36:54.971
I have magic and I'mgoing to fight to be here.

36:55.074 --> 36:56.800
I'm going to go
Robyn and Jared.

36:56.904 --> 36:58.181
I think Jared and Robyn.

36:58.285 --> 36:59.527
It started on garnish.

36:59.631 --> 37:01.080
That's what happened tonight,it all started on garnish

37:01.184 --> 37:02.150
and went downhill from there.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.014
I have blood all
over my fucking hand.

37:04.118 --> 37:04.912
Where is it?

37:05.015 --> 37:05.844
It's right there.

37:05.947 --> 37:06.879
It won't stop bleeding, Chef.

37:06.983 --> 37:08.433
You didn't have a cut, babe.

37:08.536 --> 37:09.641
I know I got caught.

37:09.744 --> 37:11.401
My towel had blood all over it.

37:11.505 --> 37:14.335
I mean Gio and Van
got undercooked lamb,

37:14.439 --> 37:16.958
I got a girl on fishforgetting to drop scallops,

37:17.062 --> 37:19.375
and I'm just getting
pummeled like a fucking

37:19.478 --> 37:22.481
nerd in elementary school.

37:22.585 --> 37:24.276
It was very
unorganized tonight.

37:24.380 --> 37:26.174
What could we do to
make service better?

37:26.278 --> 37:27.693
We need to get through
tonight, first, then

37:27.797 --> 37:29.005
we can talk about what else--

37:29.108 --> 37:30.006
worry about tonight.

37:30.109 --> 37:31.007
ROBYN: I am worried
about tonight.

37:31.110 --> 37:32.180
Worry about tonight, Robyn.

37:32.284 --> 37:33.181
ROBYN: I'm not getting
an attitude would you,

37:33.285 --> 37:33.872
please don't get an
attitude with me.

37:33.975 --> 37:34.700
Worry about tonight.

37:34.804 --> 37:35.598
I am worried about tonight.

37:35.701 --> 37:36.599
Benjamin doesn't like me.

37:36.702 --> 37:38.014
He can go fuck himself.

37:38.117 --> 37:40.085
And the boys all they
do is snap, snap, snap.

37:40.188 --> 37:42.674
Like let me see a fuckingleader in the damn blue kitchen.

37:42.777 --> 37:44.883
I'm sorry we do thingsdifferent on the girls side.

37:44.986 --> 37:46.298
We let each other know.

37:46.402 --> 37:47.817
When you guys break down, youguys don't communicate well,

37:47.920 --> 37:48.680
then you guys yell.
I know--

37:48.783 --> 37:49.888
--excuse me?

37:49.991 --> 37:50.820
You need to chill out.

37:50.923 --> 37:53.201
You're not like a pro, OK?

37:53.305 --> 37:55.687
She talks about communication,but yet she doesn't listen.

37:55.790 --> 37:58.586
I think the team would bestronger without Robyn.

37:58.690 --> 38:00.001
You need to chill out.

38:00.105 --> 38:01.658
I am chilling out, I was justtrying to communicate with you.

38:01.762 --> 38:02.625
All you do is talk.

38:02.728 --> 38:03.764
You don't communicate.

38:03.867 --> 38:05.283
You're just jumping up
and down making noise.

38:11.841 --> 38:15.223
[door slams]

38:15.327 --> 38:18.675
[dramatic music playing]

38:27.305 --> 38:31.792
Blue team, I cannot believehow far you've fallen.

38:31.895 --> 38:34.967
The red team has not
only caught up with you,

38:35.071 --> 38:37.763
they're passing you.

38:37.867 --> 38:41.595
Benjamin, blue team's
first nomination is?

38:41.698 --> 38:43.424
Jared, Chef.

38:43.528 --> 38:44.356
Jared was on garnish.

38:44.460 --> 38:45.461
He never caught up.

38:45.564 --> 38:47.566
Continued to be behind
throughout service.

38:47.670 --> 38:49.050
Blue team second nomination?

38:52.226 --> 38:54.159
Robyn, Chef.

38:54.262 --> 38:56.230
Jared, Robyn, step forwards.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.475
[pensive music playing]

39:00.821 --> 39:01.615
GORDON RAMSAY: Jared?

39:01.718 --> 39:02.650
JARED: Yes, Chef.

39:02.754 --> 39:03.927
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:04.031 --> 39:07.068
I'm just a stronger
chef than Robyn is.

39:07.172 --> 39:09.277
Yes, I had a poor
service tonight.

39:09.381 --> 39:10.313
I got lost chef.

39:10.417 --> 39:11.521
I'm not going to lie to you.

39:11.625 --> 39:14.317
I got real lost, but everyother night I have been

39:14.421 --> 39:16.733
a vocal voice in the kitchen.

39:16.837 --> 39:17.941
You were vocal?

39:18.045 --> 39:19.667
Ooh, yeah, you were vocal.

39:19.771 --> 39:23.395
It went like this, "Medic!"

39:23.499 --> 39:26.778
That's the only time Iheard you use your voice.

39:26.881 --> 39:31.265
I cut my finger, Chef, andit wouldn't stop bleeding.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.991
I spoke to the medic.

39:33.094 --> 39:35.407
Jared, he couldn't find the cut.

39:35.511 --> 39:37.375
[laughs]

39:37.478 --> 39:41.171
Robyn, are you bonding
in the blue team?

39:41.275 --> 39:45.383
I would like to go back
to the red team, Chef.

39:45.486 --> 39:47.108
There was embarrassment
in that kitchen tonight

39:47.212 --> 39:49.352
and there was no recuperating.

39:49.456 --> 39:51.112
How can you say you wantto go back to the red team.

39:51.216 --> 39:52.079
You're part of the blue team.

39:52.182 --> 39:53.701
We're a team.

39:53.805 --> 39:55.082
I understand that,
I'm just saying

39:55.185 --> 39:56.704
I think the communicationis a little bit

39:56.808 --> 39:59.397
poor on the blue team
and we need to fix it.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.536
It needs to be fixed because--

40:00.639 --> 40:02.054
--how does that get it
fixed, saying you want

40:02.158 --> 40:03.366
to go back to the red team?- Because I--

40:03.470 --> 40:04.367
-- you're in the blue team!

40:04.471 --> 40:05.472
I understand that
I was a blue team

40:05.575 --> 40:06.852
but I never asked to
go to the blue team.

40:06.956 --> 40:08.475
I was put here on the blue team.

40:08.578 --> 40:09.993
That was all I'm
saying, so I feel

40:10.097 --> 40:12.064
like I'm starting from day oneover again, but I'm a fighter.

40:12.168 --> 40:13.859
And I'll go wherever youwant me, Chef, because I want

40:13.963 --> 40:14.998
to be here at Hell's Kitchen.

40:15.102 --> 40:16.759
I know I could do better.

40:16.862 --> 40:18.899
I have heart,
passion, dedication,

40:19.002 --> 40:20.107
and I'm not quitting.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.143
I saw someone quit on myteam today when he called

40:22.247 --> 40:23.282
for a medic for a little cut.

40:23.386 --> 40:24.180
And I'm beginning--

40:24.283 --> 40:25.077
--I came right back.

40:28.633 --> 40:31.083
Robyn, Jared, I'm--

40:31.187 --> 40:31.981
I'm done with excuses.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.710
My decision is--

40:36.813 --> 40:40.127
[dramatic music playing]

40:44.200 --> 40:51.207
Robyn-- get back in line.

40:51.310 --> 40:53.830
Jared, take off your jackets.

40:57.662 --> 40:59.698
You never hit your
stride since you arrived

40:59.802 --> 41:01.182
and too inconsistent.

41:01.286 --> 41:02.321
Yes, Chef.

41:02.425 --> 41:03.219
Thank you, Chef.

41:03.322 --> 41:04.392
- I wish you luck.
- Thank you.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.635
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:05.739 --> 41:06.533
Good night, guys.

41:06.636 --> 41:07.499
Bye, Jared.

41:12.642 --> 41:13.954
Chef Ramsay definitely
made a mistake

41:14.057 --> 41:15.162
by sending me home tonight.

41:15.265 --> 41:16.404
It should be Robyn.

41:16.508 --> 41:17.509
She's a mess.

41:17.613 --> 41:19.787
She didn't really
cook shit tonight.

41:19.891 --> 41:21.409
I have a legitimate cut.

41:21.513 --> 41:22.480
There's blood.

41:22.583 --> 41:23.826
There's visible blood.

41:23.929 --> 41:26.725
I'm not going to cook foodwith fucking blood on my hand.

41:26.829 --> 41:28.520
It's not sanitary.

41:28.624 --> 41:29.417
I'm done, guys.

41:29.521 --> 41:31.109
My patience is running out.

41:31.212 --> 41:35.251
And tomorrow it will be a testlike you've never done before.

41:35.354 --> 41:36.321
Is that understood?

41:36.424 --> 41:37.356
Yes, Chef.

41:37.460 --> 41:40.014
Get out of here.

41:40.118 --> 41:41.844
Robyn, telling ChefRamsay she wants to be back

41:41.947 --> 41:43.431
on the red team
it's disrespectful

41:43.535 --> 41:45.468
and a slap in everybody'sface that's on the blue team.

41:45.572 --> 41:47.194
I think the bitch move
that she fucking pulled

41:47.297 --> 41:49.852
up there was fucking horrible.

41:49.955 --> 41:52.510
I think the blue team'sgoing to fall like dominoes.

41:52.613 --> 41:54.304
Sorry, Robyn, we just
found our groove.

41:54.408 --> 41:57.135
We don't want you
back right now.

41:57.238 --> 41:59.068
Robyn is going to
be the next one out.

41:59.171 --> 42:01.035
As far as I'm concerned, shecan go back on the red team

42:01.139 --> 42:01.967
it don't matter.

42:02.071 --> 42:04.591
We'll be all right on blue team.

42:04.694 --> 42:05.488
GORDON RAMSAY: Medic?

42:05.592 --> 42:07.179
More like pathetic.

42:07.283 --> 42:09.941
While Jared's cut wasimaginary, now he knows what

42:10.044 --> 42:12.253
it really is like to get cut.

42:18.501 --> 42:20.779
NARRATOR: Next time onHell's Kitchen All stars.

42:20.883 --> 42:23.126

team gets kicked out?

42:23.230 --> 42:24.058
DANA: Gets kicked out?

42:24.162 --> 42:26.302
What the fuck

42:26.405 --> 42:28.028

42:28.131 --> 42:29.547

You said you want
to go to the red team.

42:31.065 --> 42:32.377
- Deuces.
- Wow, that was quick.

42:32.480 --> 42:33.516
They told me to go.

42:33.620 --> 42:35.104
NARRATOR: And only the
strong will survive.

42:35.207 --> 42:36.554

42:36.657 --> 42:37.451
I'm not leaving.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.797
No, no, way!

42:38.901 --> 42:40.868
NARRATOR: But these chefswon't go down without a fight.

42:40.972 --> 42:42.249
It's on now, baby.

42:42.352 --> 42:43.181
Of course it's fucking on.

42:43.284 --> 42:44.147
It's really on.

42:44.251 --> 42:46.736
She better hope I
go home tonight.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.151
