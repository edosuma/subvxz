WEBVTT

00:03.640 --> 00:04.971
Cass, are you there?

00:05.040 --> 00:06.530
Sammy's hurt.

00:06.600 --> 00:07.840
He's hurt pretty bad.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.331
I know you think
that I'm pissed at you.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.606
Cass, can we talk?

00:10.680 --> 00:12.284
You can't stay.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.322
I don't care
that the angels fell.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.367
So whatever you did.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.488
I didn't know he was gonna
cast the angels out of heaven.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.927
Metatron.
He's the scribe of God.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.041
These were never trials.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.121
This is a spell.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.447
He took my grace.
It's why I'm human.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.130
It doesn't matter, okay?
We'll work it out.

00:27.160 --> 00:29.128
It's a tablet, I translate,
that's what you do.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.128
Kevin,
you are a Prophet of the Lord.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.805
Please, man, I need you here.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.248
If angels come a-knockin',
you just let 'em on in.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.327
Beautiful, Buddy.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.322
Thank you, Bart.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.811
It's Bartholomew.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.205
Our fallen brothers and sisters

00:42.280 --> 00:44.965
are finding vessels
faster than we'd even hoped.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.480
This one goes out to any angel
with their ears on.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.487
I need your help.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.443
- Start with a name.
- Ezekiel.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.686
There is a chance
I can fix your brother.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.285
I heal Sam while healing myself.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.287
A possession?

00:54.320 --> 00:55.970
I'm a mess, Dean.
You know it.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.002
I can't let you put this
on yourself.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.525
I wouldn't do that, Dean.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.130
You shouldn't be here.

02:03.280 --> 02:07.285
We have just as much right
to be here as you do, brother.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.850
All right, girls, everybody.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.607
So he's better?

03:06.680 --> 03:09.126
Yes.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.605
Sam is much improved.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.251
It shouldn't be much longer now.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.289
Okay, you know, you said the same
thing to me last week, right?

03:18.400 --> 03:21.244
As I told you when we met,
this will take time.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.924
Okay, well, go then.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.450
Heal.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.761
I'd like my brother back,
please.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.961
I must say, Dean,

03:33.040 --> 03:35.805
I'm very uncomfortable
with this whole trip.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.571
Investigating crimes
involving angels

03:38.640 --> 03:40.642
or anything involving angels

03:40.720 --> 03:43.564
puts me, and therefore,
Sam, at risk.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.961
Well, family business, Zeke.
Okay?

03:46.280 --> 03:47.406
If we ignore this,

03:47.600 --> 03:49.682
Sam's gonna think
that something fishy's going on.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.326
Then I trust you
will be discreet.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.800
Wait, if you know
where we're going,

03:56.920 --> 03:58.251
that means
you've been listening in.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.561
Are you... are you hearing
everything between me and Sam?

04:00.880 --> 04:02.041
No.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.327
Just a word here and there.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.882
I have better things to do
with my time than eavesdrop,

04:07.960 --> 04:09.724
like heal your brother.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.770
- Okay, 'cause here's the thing...
- I was gonna say,

04:12.760 --> 04:14.728
it seems like it's getting really
quiet out there, you know?

04:14.800 --> 04:15.801
Not a peep from the angels,

04:15.840 --> 04:17.683
even Buddy Boyle
goes off the air

04:17.720 --> 04:19.005
and stops recruiting for them.

04:19.079 --> 04:20.844
Obviously a calm
before the storm.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.849
Yeah, maybe.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.526
What?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.891
That sign said
"Fort Collins, 50 miles."

04:34.040 --> 04:35.201
So?

04:35.360 --> 04:38.250
So last time I looked,
like, 12 seconds ago,

04:38.320 --> 04:40.800
Fort Collins was 100 miles.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.363
Well, hey, man, ever since that
goddess got her hooks into you...

04:44.400 --> 04:46.050
No, it's more than Vesta.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.531
I mean, this kind of thing's
been happening to me.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.769
Like, like, there are
chunks of time just missing.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.003
Like, there are times
when I'm not here.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.207
Well, like I've said...

04:56.240 --> 04:57.730
Yes, the trials.
I know. I heard you.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.040
I heard you
when you said it the last week

04:59.080 --> 05:00.923
and the week before that
and the week before that.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.321
Yeah, because damn straight
the trials.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.243
They whacked you, man.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.487
You're not up
to warp speed yet. Okay?

05:07.560 --> 05:09.050
But you will be.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.088
Would I lie?

05:24.040 --> 05:25.769
One of your guys
is here already.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.648
Ah, my colleagues.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.890
Agent.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.800
Agent?

05:58.960 --> 06:00.928
Cass, what the hell are you doing?

06:01.920 --> 06:04.400
Um... I still have
that badge you gave me.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.051
Yeah, uh,
what the hell are you doing?

06:08.600 --> 06:09.806
The murders were all over the news.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.689
I thought I might be of help.

06:12.800 --> 06:16.009
Yeah, but Cass, you know this is
an angel situation, right?

06:16.080 --> 06:17.809
I mean, you left that night

06:17.880 --> 06:18.847
because angels were on your ass.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.646
Yeah, and you were living
the life, you know?

06:21.647 --> 06:24.450
Early retirement, working your
way up the Gas-n-Sip ladder.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.609
Well, if angels are slaughtering
one another,

06:27.720 --> 06:29.000
I have to do what I can to help.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.486
This is a risk
we should be willing to take,

06:31.520 --> 06:32.806
don't you think?

06:35.200 --> 06:36.959
Hey.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.849
Cass is back in town.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.760
Seriously, did you...
did he just say that?

06:41.920 --> 06:45.402
These angels,
they were butchered.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.608
Much more violence
than this required.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.808
Definitely took
more than one or two killers

06:52.960 --> 06:54.121
to pull this off.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.720
Hit squad?
Bartholomew's people?

06:56.840 --> 06:59.127
Well, Bartholomew
has a faction we know about,

06:59.160 --> 07:00.889
but this could be
somebody else entirely.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.167
We don't know.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.802
Well, whoever it is,

07:05.840 --> 07:07.490
we'll find them.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.359
We'll find them.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.010
That's great.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.324
Good evening, Malachi.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.408
Where is he?

08:14.440 --> 08:17.205
Bartholomew
is quite busy tonight.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.959
With such a large following,

08:19.960 --> 08:22.247
well, the responsibilities
are enormous.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.091
I called for a top-level summit.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.730
I don't deal with handmaidens.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.927
I'll convey your thoughts
to Bartholomew.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.650
He'll regret the disrespect.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.441
You speak of disrespect,
Malachi?

08:36.480 --> 08:39.198
After the bloodbath
two nights ago?

08:39.200 --> 08:40.850
Bartholomew's naked grab
for power

08:40.851 --> 08:43.320
was nothing but disrespect.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.206
He and I ultimately want
the same thing.

08:49.240 --> 08:53.086
The only way we can take heaven
back from Metatron is to unite.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.846
And if Bartholomew wants to
avoid all-out warfare on Earth,

08:56.960 --> 09:00.407
he'll meet personally with me
to negotiate terms.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.079
I'm sorry.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.843
I should've mentioned earlier,
Bartholomew said to tell you

09:06.844 --> 09:09.161
he doesn't negotiate
with street thugs.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.444
Are we done here?

09:15.360 --> 09:16.441
Yes, we are.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.445
And so it begins.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.847
It is so good
being together again.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.561
You know, this is my first beer
as a human.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.569
I hope it's okay,
me joining you.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.284
Why wouldn't it be okay?

09:57.400 --> 09:59.164
You know, Cass,
are you sure you're ready

09:59.165 --> 10:01.208
to jump back into all this?

10:01.280 --> 10:03.442
I mean, it seemed to me like
you'd actually found some peace.

10:03.520 --> 10:08.481
Hey, you once told me that you
don't choose what you do.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.841
It chooses you.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.850
I'm a part of this.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.171
Like it or not.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.523
All right, well then,
in that case,

10:21.524 --> 10:24.079
we have to figure out
who are we up against,

10:24.080 --> 10:25.844
what do they want,
and how do we stop them.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.161
Well, Bartholomew wants
to reverse Metatron's spell.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.049
Presumably to retake heaven

10:33.120 --> 10:35.088
once his following
is large enough.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.969
That's according to April.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.003
The reaper you banged?

10:39.080 --> 10:41.082
- Yeah, and you stabbed.
- Yeah.

10:42.280 --> 10:43.441
She was hot.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.319
So hot.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.324
- And very nice.
- Mm.

10:48.360 --> 10:52.126
Up to the point
she started torturing me.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.446
Yeah.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.568
Well, not every hook-up's perfect.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.682
All right.
I'm gonna get us another round.

10:57.683 --> 10:59.921
Nah. I'll get it.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.725
You know,
I've never done this before.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.605
One beer, he's hammered.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.724
Oh, boy.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.202
Well, what are you going to do
about this?

11:18.840 --> 11:20.126
About Cass?

11:20.240 --> 11:21.919
He is a beacon, Dean,

11:21.920 --> 11:24.321
pulling every angel
for miles down on our heads.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.203
All right, you know what, Zeke?
Level with me.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.730
What is it
that you're so afraid of?

11:29.240 --> 11:30.685
I told you.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.121
When I chose to answer
your prayers and heal Sam,

11:33.200 --> 11:34.770
I chose sides.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.247
That means I'm not in good
standing with certain angels.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.321
Okay, well, you know what?

11:38.322 --> 11:40.524
Cass isn't in good standing
with any angel, all right?

11:40.525 --> 11:43.569
But here he is, ass on the line,
fighting the fight.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.364
So tell me,
what makes you so special?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.004
Here we go.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.399
Three brewskies.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.721
I'm going to get something
out of the car.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.885
Well, I'm really
looking forward to this.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.079
Excuse me?

12:04.080 --> 12:06.651
Oh, please.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.605
I know who you really are.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.324
And it isn't Ezekiel.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.922
I noticed you look...

12:30.680 --> 12:32.330
...kind of uncomfortable

12:32.360 --> 12:35.284
whenever Sam mentions
my leaving.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.610
Doesn't he know
that you told me to leave?

12:42.640 --> 12:44.319
Here's the deal.

12:44.320 --> 12:47.529
When Sam was doing the trials
to seal up hell,

12:47.600 --> 12:49.125
it messed him up.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.207
Okay?

12:50.208 --> 12:51.770
The third one nearly killed him.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.531
If I'd let him finish,
it would have.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.530
He's still messed up bad.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.085
You said the angel Ezekiel
helped heal him.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.211
Look, I got to do anything I can
to get him back.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.679
Now if that means that we keep
our distance from you

13:13.680 --> 13:15.205
for a little while, then

13:15.280 --> 13:17.521
I don't have a choice.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.681
I don't feel good about it,
but I don't have a choice.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.487
It's great to have
your help, Cass.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.282
Okay? But we just can't
work together.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.010
Relax.
I'm not here to out you.

13:36.080 --> 13:40.279
But I am curious, why Ezekiel?

13:40.280 --> 13:45.286
They say he is a good
and honorable angel.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.286
Ahh...

13:49.360 --> 13:51.839
Everything they say you are not.

13:51.840 --> 13:54.411
I see your point,

13:54.440 --> 13:56.602
Gadreel.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.882
The stories about me,
they are not true.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.239
And yet you spent countless
thousands of years

14:02.240 --> 14:04.527
locked in heaven's
darkest dungeon,

14:04.528 --> 14:10.641
and now you're hiding in
this human, posing as Ezekiel.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.121
Tragic.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.009
It broke his heart
to lock you away, you know?

14:17.010 --> 14:21.039
You were God's most trusted.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.850
That's why he chose you
to protect the garden.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.606
Your one task was to keep evil
from entering,

14:27.720 --> 14:31.959
from befouling
his cherished creation, mankind,

14:31.960 --> 14:33.319
and you failed him.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.439
Not my doing.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.922
Well, for whatever reason,
the serpent entered.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.199
The earth is cursed with evil.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.487
Someone had to be blamed.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.845
What is it you want of me,
Metatron?

14:46.920 --> 14:49.526
Just to be your friend.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.807
You and I go back a long way.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.684
I was actually the one
who freed you.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.364
You?

14:59.160 --> 15:02.801
I was the one who caused
all the angels to fall.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.081
Including the imprisoned ones.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.483
You're welcome.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.688
No angels are in heaven?

15:13.720 --> 15:14.687
None at all?

15:14.720 --> 15:19.203
No, and, you know, at first,
I thought I would love it.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.886
But this is a big place.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.531
My solitude is getting tedious.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.846
And so?

15:27.560 --> 15:29.528
And so,

15:30.880 --> 15:32.609
Plan B.

15:33.400 --> 15:37.291
Rebuild heaven
as the place God envisioned it,

15:37.360 --> 15:39.249
only with a handpicked few.

15:39.320 --> 15:44.042
No more anemic functionaries
like Bartholomew.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.088
And no more stupid angels.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.365
Maybe some funny ones.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.403
You were his most trusted,
Gadreel.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.721
You want to take back
your reputation?

15:58.760 --> 16:00.922
You want to reclaim
the heaven that was?

16:03.360 --> 16:05.124
We could do this together.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.130
Any word from Cass?

16:13.240 --> 16:15.049
Nothing yet.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.570
And we're not worried about him

16:16.640 --> 16:19.166
that he just took off
like that again?

16:19.240 --> 16:21.641
I mean, it's not like he does
this kind of stuff alone.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.961
It's the way he wanted it.
Honestly.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.770
Look, man,
he's been all over the map

16:26.880 --> 16:28.564
since he got his wings clipped.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.165
What you got?

16:30.240 --> 16:32.720
Obituaries.
That one of the bikers?

16:32.760 --> 16:34.285
Yeah.
His name was Red Dawg.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.282
Of course, it was.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.089
It's not what you think.
He's a family guy.

16:37.090 --> 16:39.924
Big in the PTA, he played Santa
at Christmas parties.

16:39.960 --> 16:42.201
So what, just one day,
he up and joined a biker gang?

16:42.240 --> 16:44.846
No, he did that years ago.
Get this. This is weird.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.841
Look. These are all
the victims, right?

16:47.920 --> 16:49.604
They were all baptized together.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.330
- Baptized?
- Yeah.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.085
They were
a born-again biker gang.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.603
Well, that is not something
you hear every day.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.364
No, it's not.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.487
Wait, make that bigger.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.361
Boyle's boys?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.010
Boyle, as in reverend Buddy Boyle?

17:08.720 --> 17:10.239
Listen to this.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.844
"Red Dawg's widow said
he was always religious,

17:11.920 --> 17:12.842
but a week before he died,

17:12.920 --> 17:14.126
he came home
from a prayer meeting

17:14.160 --> 17:17.130
and was a changed man
filled with divine glory."

17:17.200 --> 17:18.964
So Boyle's at it again.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.287
Selling folks
on being meat suits for angels.

17:21.319 --> 17:24.130
Just what,
talking to smaller groups now?

17:24.160 --> 17:26.527
I don't know. Maybe softening up
thousands at a time,

17:26.599 --> 17:28.728
he wasn't able to control
what angels got let in.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.565
This way, Bartholomew's
followers can jump in

17:31.640 --> 17:34.041
just as soon
as Boyle does his thing.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.124
So Red Dawg and his guys
were Bartholomew people?

17:37.200 --> 17:39.441
Yeah, and they got slaughtered,

17:39.480 --> 17:41.448
which means that this new group
is even worse.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.327
Haven't I always said
that angels are dicks?

17:45.400 --> 17:47.482
And I so appreciate
the opportunity

17:47.520 --> 17:49.727
to address
your Bible-study group.

17:49.800 --> 17:54.169
I admire your passion,
your energy, your devotion.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.329
You are exactly what God
and his angels have in mind

17:57.400 --> 17:58.731
for the crusade.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.723
Now rise.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.243
Join hands, all of you.

18:07.120 --> 18:11.045
Feel the heavenly host
reach out to embrace you.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.487
Embrace them back.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.366
The angels want nothing more
than to feel your love.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.641
Welcome them into your hearts.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.886
Let them in.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.159
In the name of Malachi,
let them in!

18:28.680 --> 18:29.806
No!

18:47.360 --> 18:50.364
Frankly,
I never got used to them.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.441
I lived among them
for centuries.

18:52.442 --> 18:54.522
I had to isolate myself
to keep sane.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.685
Humans do seem chaotic,
Metatron.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.371
Which makes them fascinating,
but...

19:02.600 --> 19:05.251
...all that emotion.
Geez.

19:06.080 --> 19:10.085
And the wasted energy.
It's just exhausting.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.246
I know.

19:12.760 --> 19:13.886
Sam Winchester.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.884
It is a mess in here.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.651
And the brother,
I do not know where to start.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.451
I can free you from them.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.850
From all of them.

19:26.920 --> 19:31.005
You intend to be the ruler of
this new heaven, am I correct?

19:36.760 --> 19:40.446
It is a burden
I feel I must accept.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.161
Then, Metatron,
does that not make you God?

19:45.240 --> 19:46.844
Oh.

19:48.440 --> 19:49.646
Semantics.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.919
I don't know that
I'd take on that name,

19:54.920 --> 19:56.490
necessarily.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.164
No.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.608
When the time comes,
we'll call me...

20:02.720 --> 20:03.721
... "X."

20:05.960 --> 20:06.960
"X"?

20:08.440 --> 20:10.959
You and I,

20:10.960 --> 20:13.361
we could have paradise again,
Gadreel.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.126
Okay. I'm...

20:21.160 --> 20:23.208
...unfamiliar with this end
of the process.

20:27.200 --> 20:31.569
'Course, no one may be listening,

20:31.640 --> 20:34.041
um, but I do need assistance.

20:35.760 --> 20:40.607
I have questions,
and there seem to be no answers.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.165
I wouldn't presume
to ask for help

20:42.200 --> 20:44.965
if I weren't desperate,
but I need help.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.685
I'm lost.
I need your guidance.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.081
Please hear my prayer.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.451
I don't know how humans do it.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.080
Try plugging it in.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.969
Surely that wasn't the answer
you were seeking.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.441
You're an angel.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.443
Muriel.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.682
I didn't pick the outfit.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.887
Castiel?

21:30.400 --> 21:32.050
No, wait.
Please, just hear me out.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.969
It can't be known
that I even spoke to you.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.042
- I just need a moment.
- No.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.565
Please.

21:38.520 --> 21:39.885
I just need information.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.966
Dean, there may be nothing in here.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.883
Crowley said the spell
that cast down the angels

21:48.920 --> 21:50.410
was irreversible.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.568
Yeah, well, screw Crowley.

21:52.600 --> 21:56.127
Why would you think
that anything he says is true?

21:56.200 --> 21:59.249
This part
is nearly indecipherable.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.408
Almost like
when Metatron wrote it down,

22:01.480 --> 22:03.084
he wanted
to keep the words hidden,

22:03.120 --> 22:06.283
even from prophets.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.282
Hey.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.408
Hey.
Check this out.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.886
Another angel attack.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.251
What? Where?

22:13.280 --> 22:15.009
Utah.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.163
A college Bible-study group

22:18.240 --> 22:22.006
and their guest speaker,
some top-shelf church lady.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.321
Insides scorched out,
kids' eyes were missing,

22:24.400 --> 22:25.640
but not the church lady's.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.646
So she was an angel, too?

22:28.720 --> 22:30.085
Sounds like.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.611
And she sang soprano

22:31.640 --> 22:34.007
for the Melody Ministry glee club.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.087
Okay.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.009
The club goes to its gigs
on a bus.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.003
So when I checked
with the Wyoming cops,

22:41.080 --> 22:44.289
they said that a witness saw
the same bus leaving

22:44.320 --> 22:46.288
the biker bar not long
before the bodies were found.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.766
So church-lady angel
was at both killings?

22:51.960 --> 22:55.043
I'm guessing that she
and whoever she's running with

22:55.120 --> 22:56.770
killed Bartholomew's bikers
at the bar

22:56.800 --> 22:58.131
and then Bart's boys
hit her back.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.282
When she was recruiting
those students to be vessels.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.964
Wow. A bunch of kids.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.927
Kevin.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.041
Clock's ticking.

23:12.040 --> 23:15.328
Let's say you're telling the
truth and Metatron tricked you,

23:15.360 --> 23:17.761
I should still turn you in.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.201
But you won't.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.486
Don't be so sure.

23:21.520 --> 23:25.650
I... I think
you instinctively trust me.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.490
We're similar.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.363
We both want no part
of the fanatics.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.159
And when you prayed,

23:33.160 --> 23:36.403
how did you know
you wouldn't get one of them?

23:36.560 --> 23:38.847
I'm warded and my grace is gone
and I was hoping

23:38.880 --> 23:41.690
that I would seem like
just another desperate human

23:41.760 --> 23:44.843
that the militants
couldn't care less about.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.410
And you think I care?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.970
You're here.
You may know the situation.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.527
Bartholomew, he's in a blood
feud with another faction.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.527
It's madness.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.528
Who leads the opposition?

23:57.560 --> 23:58.641
Malachi.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.448
Malachi, the anarchist?

24:01.520 --> 24:04.444
He's become equals
with Bartholomew.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.170
In some ways, worse.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.362
But there's still those like you

24:08.400 --> 24:09.640
who want to stay out of it.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.011
Fewer and fewer.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.964
Each side is rounding up
those who try and stay neutral.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.407
Angels are being tortured
and killed

24:16.480 --> 24:17.640
if they don't pledge loyalty.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.565
It's worse than I thought.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.170
Each side
wants to crush the other,

24:23.160 --> 24:25.845
overthrow Metatron,
and rule heaven,

24:25.880 --> 24:28.724
and heaven
under either of them would be...

24:28.725 --> 24:30.324
Hell.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.242
This is a bonus, Castiel.

24:45.160 --> 24:49.359
We were tracking Muriel,
cowardly hold-out that she is,

24:49.360 --> 24:51.283
and wonder of wonders,

24:53.160 --> 24:54.650
she led us to you.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.084
Not knowingly.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.446
I stand corrected.

25:01.560 --> 25:02.799
Not knowingly.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.006
Stupidly.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.810
I've explained in detail.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.241
I don't know
how Metatron's spell worked.

25:11.360 --> 25:15.843
Therefore,
I can't assist in reversing it.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.809
I was an unwitting accomplice.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.962
Oh.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.481
A dupe.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.483
The great Castiel,

25:24.560 --> 25:27.723
valued and trusted Castiel,

25:27.760 --> 25:31.924
top-of-the-Christmas-tree Castiel.
No more than a dupe.

25:34.960 --> 25:38.089
Dupe or mastermind,
you were inside the circle.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.600
You know
where Metatron's weakness lies.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.205
No.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.406
I don't.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.804
Theo.

25:54.520 --> 25:55.806
No.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.209
You'd suffer,
even die for your beliefs.

26:06.280 --> 26:07.280
I get it.

26:08.320 --> 26:12.325
But is Metatron, whose poll
numbers have totally tanked,

26:12.400 --> 26:13.639
worth your life?

26:13.640 --> 26:17.725
More importantly,
is Metatron worth her life?

26:21.120 --> 26:22.690
No.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.489
No, she's innocent.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.562
You leave her alone.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.842
I have no intentions
of touching her.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.449
Virtue is its own punishment.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.521
Please, no!

26:46.560 --> 26:47.686
No!

26:54.920 --> 26:59.130
Angels butchering angels.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.970
Is this what we've become?

27:04.760 --> 27:07.889
Just following your example,
Castiel.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.008
How many did you kill in heaven?

27:10.040 --> 27:12.088
How many in the fall?

27:13.960 --> 27:16.406
Oh, you didn't know?

27:16.440 --> 27:19.091
A host of angels died
when they fell.

27:19.160 --> 27:22.562
Azrael, Sophia, Ezekiel.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.967
"Died" doesn't even describe it.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.127
Devastation.

27:26.200 --> 27:31.206
Wings shredded,
unspeakable agony at your hands.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.571
So I think

27:32.600 --> 27:37.049
you would want to provide
any information you have,

27:37.080 --> 27:39.367
considering...

27:43.440 --> 27:44.646
All right.

27:46.080 --> 27:48.401
I leave you
in the hands of an artist.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.171
I don't care what's left.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.450
Don't ask for mercy.

28:00.480 --> 28:01.641
There is none.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.800
I'll give you one last chance
for this to end.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.889
Give me a quick death.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.962
I need you to speak to Metatron.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.560
Everyone knows
you have influence.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.886
He'll listen to you.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.203
Ask him to raise me to heaven.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.729
You can do this, Castiel.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.167
I'll be a soldier for Metatron,
do anything he wants.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.565
You, you serve Malachi.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.642
I thought he was the answer,
but he's crazy.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.331
You're noticing this now?

28:56.360 --> 28:58.488
You were more than willing
to do his dirty work.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.568
I did what I had to.

29:00.640 --> 29:04.008
When you were sure
he would defeat Bartholomew.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.560
But no one will survive
this war.

29:07.840 --> 29:09.524
So you prefer to sit it out
in heaven.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.127
I can talk to him
about restoring your grace.

29:16.720 --> 29:20.122
Well, it's, um, it's true.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.562
Metatron and I do have
a working relationship.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.325
I knew it.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.119
You're clever, Theo.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.610
We're allies.

29:31.600 --> 29:36.049
And he could use
a skilled soldier like yourself.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.122
Oh, but I don't know.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.282
I'm a team player, Castiel.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.521
All right. Well.

30:04.960 --> 30:08.407
I'll need a moment
to make contact.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.923
And you have something
that I'll need.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.490
Anything.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.526
Oh, no.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.130
Hey. You seen Sam?

31:35.160 --> 31:36.127
He went out.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.127
Where?

31:37.160 --> 31:39.083
I don't know.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.650
You notice he's doing that
a lot?

31:42.040 --> 31:43.246
Yeah.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.127
Yeah.

31:47.160 --> 31:49.162
Dean, I don't have
a lot of time, so listen.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.409
The leader of the opposition
is an angel named Malachi.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.130
How do you know that?

31:54.160 --> 31:55.127
He had me.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.925
I, uh, I was tortured.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.241
- But I got away.
- How?

32:02.320 --> 32:05.688
I... I did what I had to.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.928
I became what they've become.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.287
A barbarian.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.203
What are you...
Cass, where are you?

32:14.520 --> 32:15.851
It's better I stay away.

32:15.880 --> 32:17.484
They're gonna want me
even more now.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.488
But I'm gonna be all right.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.648
I got my grace back.

32:21.680 --> 32:26.129
Well, not mine per se,
but it'll do.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.328
Wait, you're... you're back?
You got your mojo?

32:29.880 --> 32:31.484
I'm not sure.

32:31.520 --> 32:32.885
But I am an angel.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.604
And you're okay with that?

32:36.040 --> 32:39.283
If we're going to war,
I need to be ready.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.603
- Cass.
- Dean.

32:43.640 --> 32:44.880
There's more.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.251
What?

32:46.320 --> 32:50.245
Didn't you say Sam was healed
by an angel named Ezekiel?

32:51.720 --> 32:53.722
Yeah, why?

32:55.800 --> 32:57.404
Ezekiel is dead.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.120
What?

33:00.160 --> 33:01.571
He died when the angels fell.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.249
I need a spell, ASAP.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.526
Everyone always needs a spell,
and it's always ASAP.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.767
All right, listen to me.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.768
An angel can't be expelled
by another human.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.080
Only by the host, right?

33:19.120 --> 33:22.806
Well, what if there was a way
to power down the angel

33:22.880 --> 33:24.689
so that it wasn't in charge
for a few seconds?

33:24.760 --> 33:25.682
What?

33:25.760 --> 33:27.524
For instance, if...
if hypothetically,

33:27.600 --> 33:28.965
I wanted to speak
with the vessel,

33:29.040 --> 33:30.724
but not have the squatter
listen in.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.923
Why?

33:36.800 --> 33:37.767
You with me?

33:37.800 --> 33:39.689
And when the angels
kill each other off,

33:39.760 --> 33:41.330
the humans are taking it
in the teeth.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.209
So what if I wanted
to clue the human in

33:43.280 --> 33:46.329
so that he or she
could spit the angel out?

33:46.400 --> 33:47.731
That would be a good thing,
right?

33:47.760 --> 33:49.967
Uh... yeah.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.446
Okay. So, hit the tablet.
Let's go.

33:52.520 --> 33:53.601
Now?

33:53.840 --> 33:55.569
Yesterday, Cinderella.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.647
I've been thinking this over,
Metatron.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.608
I will join you
as second-in-command.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.645
Bravo, Gadreel.

34:17.679 --> 34:20.763
This move will erase the mark

34:20.800 --> 34:23.326
that has hounded you
through the centuries.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.250
Heaven will be restored,

34:26.320 --> 34:30.643
as will your reputation
as one of its greatest heroes.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.969
I thank you
for this opportunity.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.764
There is just one more thing.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.284
Yes.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.404
I need to be sure
of your fidelity.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.841
You have it.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.722
No, I mean really sure.

34:50.199 --> 34:53.362
We have enemies who pose an
imminent threat to our effort.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.489
They must be neutralized.

34:59.440 --> 35:00.441
Slain?

35:02.200 --> 35:03.690
In a word.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.125
That...

35:06.720 --> 35:08.370
That is not who I am.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.850
Yeah.

35:11.960 --> 35:14.281
Here's the first name
on your to-do list.

35:27.360 --> 35:28.361
Decide.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.640
All right, so this masterpiece
we just painted,

35:39.720 --> 35:40.801
it's gonna work, right?

35:40.880 --> 35:43.087
The Sigils are supposed
to briefly hobble

35:43.200 --> 35:44.645
the possessing angel.

35:44.720 --> 35:45.881
If the info's correct.

35:45.960 --> 35:46.882
Wait, what?

35:46.960 --> 35:49.804
I only had time
to get a little from the tablet.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.484
The rest came from an old
Men of Letters book.

35:51.560 --> 35:54.723
As soon as your blood touches
the ignition Sigil,

35:54.760 --> 35:56.683
the spell kicks in.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.563
Dean, what's going on?

36:00.600 --> 36:02.329
I told you.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.084
You told me theoretically.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.328
Dean, we just painted Sigils
in the storeroom.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.401
What the hell?

36:10.240 --> 36:11.605
You're gonna have to trust me.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.325
Okay, trust that I told you
everything that I can for now.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.487
Can you do that?

36:16.640 --> 36:17.687
I always trust you.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.765
And I always end up screwed.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.410
Oh, come on. Always?

36:22.440 --> 36:24.283
Not always.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.362
Hey, where you been?

36:29.440 --> 36:32.489
Hey. Beer run.

36:32.560 --> 36:35.291
Long beer run.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.010
Can we talk?

36:37.080 --> 36:39.845
Yeah. Sure.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.166
This sounds serious.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.050
What's going on?

36:57.120 --> 36:58.201
What are you doing?

36:58.280 --> 37:00.009
I got to tell you
some stuff fast.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.161
It's gonna piss you off.

37:01.280 --> 37:03.044
Okay.

37:04.480 --> 37:06.050
Those trials
really messed you up.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.049
Yes, I know that.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.491
No, you don't.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.488
I mean messed you up
like almost dead.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.210
No more birthdays, dust to dust.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.169
Well, that messed me up,
so I made a move,

37:15.200 --> 37:17.487
okay, a tough move about you
without talking it over

37:17.520 --> 37:18.806
because you were in a coma.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.888
Wait, what? When?

37:20.960 --> 37:22.610
You were in the hospital, okay,

37:22.640 --> 37:23.641
and they said
you were gonna die.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.330
Dean.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.925
What did you do?

37:29.960 --> 37:31.086
I let an angel in.

37:33.800 --> 37:34.881
In what?

37:35.920 --> 37:37.046
In you.

37:38.640 --> 37:39.880
He said he could heal you
and he is.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.200
He's still in me?

37:43.400 --> 37:45.368
Wait.
That's impossible, Dean.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.447
That couldn't happen.
I never invited him in.

37:46.520 --> 37:49.603
I tricked you into saying yes.
It seemed like the only way.

37:54.520 --> 37:57.171
So again...

37:59.200 --> 38:02.010
...you thought I couldn't handle
something, so you took over.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.361
No, I did what I had to do.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.448
You would've never agreed to it,
and you would've died.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.204
Well, maybe I would've liked
the choice, at least.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.730
We can do this later.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.489
You can... You can kick my ass
all you want.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.851
Right now,
we got bigger problems.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.609
Bigger?

38:14.680 --> 38:17.047
The angel lied to me.
Okay?

38:17.120 --> 38:18.929
He... He's not
who he said he was.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.047
He said his name was Ezekiel.

38:20.120 --> 38:22.600
Cool guy, according to Cass,
but it's not Ezekiel.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.728
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.768
Apparently, Ezekiel is dead.

38:26.840 --> 38:30.003
Whoever this guy is can end you
in a heartbeat if he wants to,

38:30.040 --> 38:32.122
so you have got to dump him.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.760
Are you hearing what I'm saying?

38:38.640 --> 38:41.803
I think you're well enough now,
but you got to expel him.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.201
Sam.

38:46.440 --> 38:47.441
Sa...

38:49.280 --> 38:50.281
Hey.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.091
Hey, Sam.

39:07.920 --> 39:08.842
Hey, do you notice anything

39:08.920 --> 39:11.446
a little bit off
about Dean lately?

39:11.480 --> 39:13.640
Between you and me,
I'm a little bit worried about him.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.442
Don't worry about Dean.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.567
Dean will be fine.

39:24.840 --> 39:25.841
No!

39:27.440 --> 39:29.602
No! No! No! Kevin?

39:34.000 --> 39:35.286
Sam.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.688
There is no more Sam.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.724
But I played him convincingly,
I thought.

39:50.720 --> 39:51.642
How did you...

39:51.720 --> 39:54.485
I heard you talk with Kevin Tran
tonight.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.091
Told me theoretically.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.049
Dean, we just painted Sigils
in the storeroom.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.531
What the hell?

40:01.680 --> 40:02.841
You're gonna
have to trust me, okay,

40:02.960 --> 40:04.485
and trust that I told you
everything I can for now.

40:04.520 --> 40:05.726
Can you do that?

40:08.480 --> 40:09.641
Alter a Sigil...

40:11.720 --> 40:12.881
...even the slightest...

40:15.560 --> 40:17.005
...alter the spell.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.243
Sorry about Kevin,
but ultimately...

40:27.400 --> 40:28.401
...it's for the best.

40:30.680 --> 40:33.081
I did what I had to.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.721
Kevin?

41:24.240 --> 41:25.241
Kevin?
