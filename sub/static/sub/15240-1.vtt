MAN: How are you,
Mr. Stevens?
How are you?

01:15.451 --> 01:16.534
Good to see you again.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.412
STEVENS: You better save
some of that film
for the official opening.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.664
lt's gonna be
a real wing-ding.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.666
When was the house built,
Mr. Stevens?

01:23.751 --> 01:27.378
My father started it in 1916.
Took four years
to complete it.

01:27.463 --> 01:31.090
And whose idea was it
to turn the estate
into a museum?

01:31.175 --> 01:34.218
That's mine.
l've always wanted
to have a place

01:34.303 --> 01:36.387
where people'd come,
and visit,

01:36.513 --> 01:38.598
and rest awhile,
and look at beautiful things.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.558
FEMALE REPORTER: How long
have you been collecting?

01:41.143 --> 01:44.270
Well, let's see.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.356
l guess l've been
collecting all my life.

01:47.441 --> 01:51.360
l started out as
a boy collecting stamps.
Then I sold them off.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.488
Then I started
collecting bicycles.

01:53.572 --> 01:57.450
Then bicycles
led to old cars.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.244
Then one day l
saw this painting.

02:00.329 --> 02:03.998
lt was a Renoir.
l guess that did it.

02:04.082 --> 02:08.211
That led to another,
and then to another,
and to another,

02:08.294 --> 02:10.670
and then,
after all these years,

02:10.756 --> 02:12.799
l felt it was time for
me to share my collection

02:12.925 --> 02:14.967
with anybody
that might enjoy it.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.803
Give it to the people.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.138
MALE REPORTER: Do you believe
that your prototype
executive aircraft

02:19.223 --> 02:20.556
will revolutionize
both the private

02:20.682 --> 02:21.974
and commercial
aircraft industry?

02:22.059 --> 02:23.392
STEVENS: I certainly hope so.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.895
FEMALE REPORTER: Mr. Stevens,
will we be receiving
a list of the guests

02:25.979 --> 02:27.021
who you've invited
down for the opening?

02:27.105 --> 02:30.066
Yeah, you'll all
get a press kit
before you leave.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.193
What about the plane
that's bringing your
guests down here, sir?

02:32.277 --> 02:33.903
We're very curious
about that.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.655
You'll see
the airplane
when it arrives.

02:35.739 --> 02:39.742
l think you'll all agree
that we brought these
guests down in style.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.590
Dulles Tower,
this is 2-3-Sierra-Heavy.

Off.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.300
Beacon light off. Radios?

05:01.385 --> 05:02.760
Off.
Okay.

05:02.844 --> 05:06.055
All righty, gents,
she's all set for tonight.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.765
Sorry I was late on
those boost pumps, Don.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.601
Don't worry about it.
See you guys later.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.729
Why'd you mention it?
He didn't notice.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.356
Are you kidding?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.983
Why the hell do you
think Stevens hires

05:17.067 --> 05:19.151
a guy like him?
He notices everything.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.403
(CHUCKLES)

05:23.073 --> 05:25.324
BUCHEK: Well?
How did it check out?

05:25.409 --> 05:27.994
Beautiful, just beautiful.
She behaved perfectly, Stan.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.079
She damn well better.
l spent the best part

05:30.247 --> 05:32.289
of a year
ramrodding this project.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.667
Well, now that Stevens
has got his dream machine,

05:34.751 --> 05:36.210
you can go back to
that nice executive life

05:36.294 --> 05:38.713
with the two-hour lunches,
a little golf
in the afternoon.

05:38.797 --> 05:39.922
l don't play golf!

05:40.090 --> 05:41.215
No?

05:41.299 --> 05:42.633
Besides, the job
won't be finished

05:42.718 --> 05:45.011
until we deliver this baby
down to Palm Beach tonight.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.096
That's true.
You're not gonna
light that thing, are you?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.473
What? No, no.
l've quit smoking.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.017
Uh-huh.
l'm quitting.

How's it going?

06:54.081 --> 06:55.331
Okay. You?

06:56.208 --> 06:57.666
Okay, thank you very much.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.335
Thank you.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.050
l wonder which is worth more,
the cargo or the plane.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.011
Well, at this point,
it's a toss-up.
l'll bet

07:51.096 --> 07:52.513
that together
they're equal

07:52.597 --> 07:55.141
to the gross
national product of Texas.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.623
Lafite Rothschild '45.

any of that stuff left.

Do you know, love?
She's in the office.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.750
Thank you.

09:44.834 --> 09:45.834
See you later.
Yeah.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.724
Mmm-hmm.

10:01.476 --> 10:05.104
My problem is a fear
of flying. What's yours?

10:05.188 --> 10:06.563
What makes you
think I have a problem?

10:06.648 --> 10:08.065
Well, we've been
living together longer

10:08.191 --> 10:09.608
than most people
are unhappily married.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.568
You think I don't know
when you have a problem?

10:11.653 --> 10:14.363
Mmm-hmm.
l don't think you can
help me with this one.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.448
l can't help you with it? l?

10:16.533 --> 10:20.327
You forget that I am a pilot,
the symbol of
strength and security.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.539
Lightning may flash,
and thunder may
roar around my plane,

10:23.623 --> 10:25.624
but when the biggie
walks through the cabin,

10:25.709 --> 10:27.835
and little old ladies
stop fingering their beads,

10:27.919 --> 10:30.462
and sweaty palms
miraculously dry up,

10:30.547 --> 10:32.464
because Gallagher
is at the controls.

10:32.549 --> 10:36.051
No harm can come to anybody.
You tell me I can't help you.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.095
Why don't you stop
talking and hold me?

10:38.179 --> 10:40.097
l'm not sure I can
do two things at once.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.433
Will you try?
l'll try. Yes.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.353
Listen. . .
Yes.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.147
Wouldn't it
just be sensational

10:48.273 --> 10:49.982
if, after
the festivities tonight,

10:50.066 --> 10:53.527
we announced that we
were getting married?

10:54.237 --> 10:58.407
Um, Mr. Stevens has
asked me to take over
the Geneva office.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.076
For a year or longer.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.580
And I think l
might like to try that.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.875
Well, I could just
get the job flying

11:08.001 --> 11:10.252
the route from New York
to Paris to Geneva.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.922
That'll be fine.
l'll see you once or
maybe twice a week.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.426
Yeah, I can't think
of a more solid basis
for a happy marriage.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.802
l've been through
one divorce.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.096
That doesn't
make you unique.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.223
Why can't we just
keep it the way it is?

11:23.350 --> 11:24.475
No, no.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.978
No, no, no, no.
Because I want
a wife and children.

11:30.482 --> 11:34.318
Not necessarily in
that order, but. . .

11:34.402 --> 11:37.863
Well,
until you make up your mind,
why don't you buy me lunch?

11:37.947 --> 11:41.825
Yeah. You make
more than I do.
We'll go dutch.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.021
They've gone.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.482
Good. Let's get moving.
We're behind schedule.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.460
Thanks, Julie. Lisa,
l'm so glad you're here.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.003
l didn't think you
were coming. Hello.

Eve, don't you?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.259
Hi.
Hello, Benjy.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.052
You father's gonna be
so pleased to see you.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.888
l wish
the feeling were mutual.
l'm doing it for Benjy.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.516
He wanted to see
his grandfather.
Thanks a lot.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.560
You're just like
your father.
What do you mean?

14:54.644 --> 14:56.770
Stubborn !
Stubborn woman.
Oh, Eve.

14:56.854 --> 14:57.938
Have you got everything,
Dorothy?

14:58.064 --> 15:00.190
Yes, we have everything.

Mrs. Livingston,
you look wonderful.

15:21.170 --> 15:25.924
Tell me,
is this plane as fantastic
as the newspapers say it is?

15:26.009 --> 15:27.718
Come and see for yourself.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.100
EVE: Well, what do you think?

15:35.184 --> 15:38.103
MRS. LlVlNGSTON:
lt's magnificent.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.355
Excuse me.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.525
Dorothy, get comfortable.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.862
And try to relax.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.490
Have a drink.
lt'll do you good.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.411

15:56.039 --> 15:57.539
l hoped you'd be
flying with us.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.249
You're missing
a fourth, Ralph.

15:59.334 --> 16:02.586
She just arrived.
Come and sit down and join us.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.629

16:03.713 --> 16:05.297
How do you do?
How do you do?

16:05.381 --> 16:06.381
Gerald Lucas.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.466
How do you do?

16:07.550 --> 16:10.802
l'm delighted to meet you.
l admire your sponsorship
of young artists.

16:10.887 --> 16:15.223
Well,
unfortunately, I don't admire
your printed attacks on them.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.060
My reviews are
never meant personally.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.355
Only a politician could
have said that better.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.982
Don't worry, gentlemen.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.610
l declare a truce
on all art critics,

16:26.694 --> 16:29.529
but only for
the duration of the flight.

16:29.614 --> 16:34.201
Right now, the name
of the game is poker.

and nothing's wild.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.832
Any objections, boys?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.755
That's one of
the nicest pictures
l've ever seen.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.215
Did you hear that, Mommy?

16:48.299 --> 16:50.884
Bonnie's class wrote
to Mr. Stevens
about their painting,

16:50.968 --> 16:53.762
and he asked
them to pick someone
to bring it to him.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.597
And they chose me.

16:55.682 --> 16:59.184

made a better choice.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.119
Who's that?

18:41.245 --> 18:42.662
That's your grandpa.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.498
Have I ever met him?

18:44.582 --> 18:47.501
Mmm-hmm. Once when
you were a little boy.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.544
How little?

18:49.670 --> 18:51.588
Oh, about like that.

18:51.672 --> 18:55.342
In the meantime,
have fun and enjoy the flight.

19:00.431 --> 19:01.556
Good evening,

like a plane's eye
view of the takeoff.

clearance momentarily,

Cleared for takeoff.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.745
We're rolling.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.520
How fast can this
plane go, Mommy?

19:48.604 --> 19:50.146
Fast enough.

20:00.950 --> 20:04.160
Grandpa sure has a neat plane,
