WEBVTT

00:02.977 --> 00:06.319
Right on schedule.
Rick's soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend.

00:06.344 --> 00:08.516
- God I love being right.
- So? She's paying a lunchtime

00:08.541 --> 00:11.122
- visit to his best friend.
- With wine?

00:11.147 --> 00:13.566
I believe the word
you're looking for is "nooner".

00:13.661 --> 00:15.652
People are the worst.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.433
- What is up with you?
- I'm just...

00:19.798 --> 00:22.132
My mom's been super clingy
since Slammergate.

00:22.157 --> 00:24.382
- And I'd to go to meet her in an hour.
- So what?

00:24.407 --> 00:26.798
So what? Don't you remember
our last "date"?

00:26.823 --> 00:28.141
The mother/daughter blow-outs?

00:28.166 --> 00:29.439
At least she's trying.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.104
Yeah, it's creepy. She's
attentive and thoughtful...

00:32.128 --> 00:34.923
- What a monster!
- She's up to something.

00:35.415 --> 00:37.657
So why don't you just talk to her?
Find out what's going on.

00:37.682 --> 00:39.519
That is a bad idea.

00:39.544 --> 00:41.129
There's so many ways
that could go wrong.

00:41.154 --> 00:43.404
Alright, then... Pomegranate!

00:43.638 --> 00:45.260
Are you having a stroke?

00:45.285 --> 00:47.981
I'm sorry, I never remember
the concussion protocol.

00:48.009 --> 00:49.804
Back in my hockey playing days,

00:49.829 --> 00:52.461
me and the boys would
often meet new...

00:52.486 --> 00:54.850
let's call them acquaintances.

00:54.875 --> 00:58.587
And if and when relations
with said acquaintances

00:58.612 --> 01:01.038
would go south, we would
call in a code word.

01:01.063 --> 01:03.794
A signal for, "I need help!"

01:04.512 --> 01:06.602
- Pomegranate.
- Exactly.

01:06.627 --> 01:08.085
Yeah, that's not gonna
be our thing.

01:08.110 --> 01:11.302
Ah! That's her.

01:11.327 --> 01:14.126
- Sorry, I gotta to bail.
- Say hi to Nora for me.

01:14.236 --> 01:16.844
- I am her favourite.
- Keep it up.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.010 --> 01:28.734
- Hey, mom. Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, that's okay!

01:28.761 --> 01:30.850
What happened to seeing a movie?

01:30.875 --> 01:32.559
I thought Liam Neeson
was your "jam".

01:32.584 --> 01:35.435
I thought we'd go for a walk.
You know, just...

01:35.460 --> 01:38.729
- Hang and talk. Talk and hang.
- In Yorkville?

01:38.809 --> 01:40.576
What do you have against
Yorkville?

01:40.601 --> 01:43.578
- It's exclusive, snobby.
- No!

01:43.603 --> 01:45.304
My hot yoga studio is over here.

01:45.329 --> 01:48.063
They're so nice and
everybody knows my name.

01:48.088 --> 01:51.139
Oh! So just like <i>Cheers,</i>
but without the fun.

01:52.143 --> 01:55.117
- That is not a cappuccino.
- Of course it's not.

01:55.142 --> 01:57.401
It's a chai soy latte.

01:57.426 --> 01:59.352
It's very good for you.
It's fantastic.

01:59.377 --> 02:01.353
It promotes good health
and peace of mind.

02:01.378 --> 02:04.109
Yet tastes like sad Christmas
and regret.

02:04.134 --> 02:07.046
You know, your astrological
sign says you drink

02:07.071 --> 02:09.699
- too much coffee.
- Ah! There it is.

02:09.723 --> 02:12.118
- Mom, I'm not broken.
- I know that.

02:12.143 --> 02:15.093
- So stop trying to fix me.
- Don't be ridiculous.

02:15.118 --> 02:17.024
I would never try to fix you.

02:19.961 --> 02:22.390
Cosmetic surgery? Mom!

02:23.086 --> 02:24.484
Come on.

02:25.354 --> 02:28.031
Mom!

02:28.056 --> 02:30.237
I knew something was going on.
Are you having work done?

02:30.262 --> 02:31.625
No.

02:31.650 --> 02:34.484
And there is nothing wrong
with cosmetic surgery.

02:34.517 --> 02:38.081
- "Jay sreekrishna", Priya.
- <i>Jai Sri Krishna,</i> Nora!

02:38.106 --> 02:41.158
- Your Gujarati greeting is excellent.
- Well, thank you.

02:41.183 --> 02:42.564
Are there any developments?

02:42.589 --> 02:45.288
I'm afraid not.
But I can get Dr. Haldar.

02:45.313 --> 02:48.900
- Please.
- Are you a regular here

02:48.925 --> 02:50.767
or something?
Do you have a punch card?

02:50.792 --> 02:52.729
- What the hell is going on, mom?
- Language, dear.

02:52.754 --> 02:54.261
<i>Hello there!</i>

02:54.286 --> 02:57.541
Hello, Dr. Rohit Haldar,
this is my daughter,

02:57.566 --> 02:59.971
- Angela Everett.
- Thanks for coming.

02:59.996 --> 03:01.908
We're a little disorganized
around here.

03:01.933 --> 03:04.360
We've had to cancel
all our appointments.

03:04.813 --> 03:06.062
I don't understand.

03:06.087 --> 03:08.413
Well, with our computer files
hacked,

03:08.438 --> 03:09.979
and the hackers
asking for a ransom...

03:10.004 --> 03:11.524
Oh, this is about a case.

03:11.549 --> 03:14.221
See, that chai latte is
making you smarter already.

03:14.246 --> 03:16.199
Nora speaks so highly of you.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.492
- You'll take the job?
- Of course she will, sweetie.

03:18.517 --> 03:20.063
Fist, I have to consult
with my partner

03:20.088 --> 03:23.663
but... I'm sorry. Sweetie?

03:24.123 --> 03:26.365
Oh, I totally forgot
to mention it.

03:26.390 --> 03:28.237
Rohit is my boyfriend.

03:32.434 --> 03:34.306
Hey! So get this.

03:34.331 --> 03:36.206
Rick, our client,
shows up at the house

03:36.231 --> 03:38.129
so I am thinking "uh-oh", right?

03:38.154 --> 03:40.854
- Uh-huh. Shade?
- [But then his girlfriend gets]

03:40.879 --> 03:42.815
[down on one knee and
proposes to him.]

03:42.840 --> 03:43.980
Shade.

03:44.005 --> 03:47.370
Turns out the best friend was
helping her with the proposal.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.236
[Shade!]

03:48.261 --> 03:50.881
- What?
- Pomegranate.

03:51.725 --> 03:53.597
Pomegranate!

04:25.463 --> 04:28.494
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:28.799 --> 04:30.894
I was inputting notes
on yesterday's procedures

04:30.924 --> 04:33.879
when my computer froze.
And that message appeared.

04:33.904 --> 04:37.729
"You have 24 hours to put $50,000

04:37.754 --> 04:40.755
"in cash on a marked bench
in Russell Park

04:40.780 --> 04:43.407
or your client files
will be released."

04:43.724 --> 04:46.168
- Your IT guy couldn't help?
- Said it was out of his league,

04:46.193 --> 04:49.934
and that we should go to the
police. But I can't do that.

04:49.959 --> 04:52.246
- Why?
- Because of the clients.

04:53.630 --> 04:56.107
This is Corey Rollins,
my surgical intern.

04:56.132 --> 04:57.276
He's going to be one
of the greats.

04:57.301 --> 04:59.081
Someone tell my boss.
He only lets me do procedures

04:59.106 --> 05:02.010
- on synthetic skin.
- Practice makes perfect.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.921
These are the P.I.s Nora
suggested.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.032
- What about the clients?
- Wealthy socialites, actors,

05:07.057 --> 05:09.541
star attorneys. They find out
their privacy's been

05:09.566 --> 05:11.315
compromised, we'll be out
of business faster

05:11.340 --> 05:14.517
- than you can say "nip tuck".
- So... Mr. Shade,

05:14.542 --> 05:17.322
- Ms. Everett, what do you think?
- Pay the money.

05:17.347 --> 05:18.096
What?

05:18.121 --> 05:19.807
Yeah. Ransomware is pretty common,

05:19.832 --> 05:21.620
but... there is not way
it can be cracked.

05:21.741 --> 05:25.176
Except... Hackers usually
demand payment in bitcoin,

05:25.201 --> 05:27.213
or some other form
of untraceable payment.

05:27.238 --> 05:29.171
- That's true.
- Whoever did this,

05:29.196 --> 05:32.364
they seems like amateurs.
And they're clearly local.

05:32.389 --> 05:34.315
We'll look into it for you.

05:34.885 --> 05:36.730
That's the best news
I've had all day!

05:36.755 --> 05:39.657
I told you you're in good
hands with Shade and Everett.

05:39.682 --> 05:42.078
- It's Everett and Shade, mom.
- It is?

05:42.266 --> 05:44.479
- Oh! Huh.
- Ha! Ha!

05:45.110 --> 05:47.298
With less than 18 hours,
we're really gonna have

05:47.323 --> 05:49.877
- to get our move on.
- Whatever you need.

05:50.148 --> 05:52.698
- Hey there, Sunesh.
- Hey, Dr. H.

05:52.723 --> 05:54.556
Priya's getting married.

05:54.581 --> 05:56.370
That's her brother, Sunesh.

05:56.395 --> 06:00.937
- Oh! Congratulations.
- Timing could not be worse.

06:00.962 --> 06:03.057
Hey. A wedding's a very
important event.

06:03.082 --> 06:06.470
So is being hacked. We should
focus on the case at hand.

06:08.305 --> 06:10.971
- Sorry. Everyone's on edge.
- Can you think

06:10.996 --> 06:13.063
of anyone who would want
to extort money from you?

06:13.088 --> 06:15.528
- Or ruin your reputation?
- No!

06:15.553 --> 06:18.905
- There's no one.
- Okay. We'll be in touch.

06:24.304 --> 06:26.983
I can't believe we're reduced to
taking a case from my mother.

06:27.008 --> 06:29.010
Whose successful plastic
surgeon boyfriend is

06:29.035 --> 06:31.002
about to cut us a big fat cheque!

06:31.027 --> 06:34.006
- I'm cool with it.
- Hey, guys! Oh, oh, oh!

06:34.660 --> 06:36.560
- You two move fast.
- So do you, mom.

06:36.585 --> 06:38.173
What's it been... a couple
of weeks with this guy?

06:38.198 --> 06:40.383
- Six months.
- In a row?

06:40.673 --> 06:43.278
Wow! Soon you'll be
exchanging keys.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.659
Please say you'll tell me
if a strange man

06:44.684 --> 06:47.560
- has a key to your house.
- Of course. Also,

06:47.585 --> 06:49.607
Rohit has a key to my house.

06:50.291 --> 06:53.337
He said he didn't have any
enemies. But he does.

06:53.362 --> 06:55.489
One. Vada Vasquez.

06:55.514 --> 06:58.415
Vada Vasquez?
The performance artist?

06:58.440 --> 07:01.866
Ex-client. Check her out
on the Instagram.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.700
The Instagram.
It must be a new thing.

07:06.908 --> 07:09.448
Why would mom hide
her boyfriend from me?

07:09.473 --> 07:11.714
Maybe she was hiding you
from her boyfriend.

07:12.010 --> 07:15.352
- Ha! Ha! Kidding.
- No, you're right.

07:15.377 --> 07:17.744
She criticizes everything I do,
how I look.

07:17.769 --> 07:20.492
She still teases me about what
I wore to my senior prom.

07:20.517 --> 07:22.032
Which was?

07:22.525 --> 07:24.983
To the grave, my friend.

07:25.805 --> 07:27.942
Anyway... Okay.

07:27.967 --> 07:31.333
Performance artist, Vada Vasquez.

07:31.358 --> 07:36.048
She is angry. Listen.
"Dr. Rohit Haldar is the enemy

07:36.073 --> 07:38.506
of women. The gatekeeper
of their bodies."

07:38.531 --> 07:41.488
- That's a little extreme.
- So are her tattoos.

07:41.513 --> 07:43.096
And her scars.

07:43.121 --> 07:47.873
Oh! She recently injected
her eyeballs with ink.

07:48.287 --> 07:49.912
Uh!

07:51.058 --> 07:52.924
You're not bothered
by any of this?

07:52.949 --> 07:55.323
People have a right
to express themselves.

07:55.348 --> 07:56.422
Really?

07:56.447 --> 07:59.205
What exactly are her green
eyeballs expressing?

07:59.230 --> 08:02.105
Deforestation. For four days

08:02.130 --> 08:03.731
I will sit on this log.

08:03.821 --> 08:06.625
Images depicting the ravaging of
Mother Earth will be projected

08:06.650 --> 08:09.467
onto my body as I cry.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.642
- Cool.
- Powerful.

08:12.667 --> 08:15.843
Right? My tears will be
crystallized into salt,

08:15.868 --> 08:17.900
and sold to promote
a greener planet.

08:18.712 --> 08:20.558
What Webzine are you from again?

08:20.583 --> 08:23.321
- Uh, <i>Performance Buzz Monthly.</i>
<i>- Ah!</i>

08:23.346 --> 08:25.570
- You guys do good work.
- Uh...

08:25.880 --> 08:29.793
Your ink injections, they were
done by Dr. Haldar, yes?

08:29.818 --> 08:33.525
No! Rohit Haldar is a con man
of the patriarchy,

08:33.551 --> 08:36.232
cutting women according
to his male gaze

08:36.258 --> 08:39.035
and forcing them into an iron
maiden of conformity.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.696
Totally.

08:41.115 --> 08:43.106
Is that why you're
trolling him online?

08:43.131 --> 08:45.029
He refused to do the injections.

08:45.054 --> 08:47.905
Said it wasn't ethical.
But you know what's not ethical?

08:48.384 --> 08:52.133
His malecentric censoring
of my body.

08:53.761 --> 08:57.758
- That'd piss me off too.
- I'm not pissed. Truth?

08:57.783 --> 09:00.481
He inspired me. For my next show,

09:00.506 --> 09:04.303
the skin on my shoulders will be
replaced by transparent synthetics.

09:04.328 --> 09:06.692
There's a doctor who'll do that?

09:06.717 --> 09:09.115
Yeah. And the best part?

09:09.140 --> 09:12.372
It's Haldar's ex-partner,
Dr. Lillian Lee.

09:17.155 --> 09:20.033
Thanks for agreeing to consult
with us here, Dr. Lee.

09:20.058 --> 09:22.061
It's not at all uncommon.
You're first-timers,

09:22.086 --> 09:24.757
and coming down to the clinic
can be a little intimidating.

09:25.416 --> 09:27.515
Your work is certainly

09:27.540 --> 09:28.791
life-altering.

09:28.816 --> 09:30.916
That's our motto
at the Rebirth clinic.

09:30.941 --> 09:33.679
The body is an evolving
sculpture. We mold it

09:33.704 --> 09:35.916
to express our clients'
inner selves.

09:35.941 --> 09:38.230
You would look adorable
with elf ears.

09:38.255 --> 09:43.743
Ha! Ha! Thank you. But we were
thinking more in the arena of...

09:44.049 --> 09:45.917
Enlargements.

09:45.942 --> 09:49.262
- For me? Or for you, dear?
- Why not both?

09:49.287 --> 09:51.290
We often tailor couples'
physicalities

09:51.315 --> 09:53.318
to suit each other's
erogenous zones.

09:53.633 --> 09:56.788
Ha! Ha! Elf ears, uh? Yeah.

09:56.813 --> 09:59.668
You know, it's funny, 'cause the
last surgeon that we spoke with

09:59.693 --> 10:01.998
wouldn't even discuss
extreme procedures.

10:02.023 --> 10:05.278
- Dr. Haldar? I liked him.
- Oh no, no, no.

10:05.539 --> 10:09.438
If you want creativity, the last
surgeon you want is Rohit Haldar.

10:09.463 --> 10:12.484
- Why's that?
- We used to be business partners.

10:12.509 --> 10:15.203
You two had a difference
in philosophies?

10:15.228 --> 10:16.852
He's so soft with the clients.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.913
Someone can't pay their bill?
No problem, take more time.

10:19.938 --> 10:21.344
That's no way to run a business.

10:21.369 --> 10:23.125
No. Especially considering

10:23.150 --> 10:25.427
how much money he had to
shell out for his son.

10:26.462 --> 10:30.242
- A son! I'm such an idiot.
- At least you still have your looks.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.301
Mom having a boyfriend
threw me off.

10:32.326 --> 10:34.000
I didn't even considered
there are skeletons

10:34.025 --> 10:36.530
- in his closet.
- Will you calm down?

10:36.555 --> 10:39.857
A son is not a skeleton.
Billions of people admit

10:39.882 --> 10:41.117
to having them.

10:41.142 --> 10:43.414
Says the guy who did a
background check on Liam

10:43.439 --> 10:44.601
when he started dating Jules.

10:44.626 --> 10:47.816
Okay. My teenage daughter.
Your mother.

10:47.841 --> 10:50.072
- There's a huge difference there.
- Yes. There is.

10:50.097 --> 10:52.273
One of them makes good choices.
And the other doesn't.

10:52.746 --> 10:54.781
Okay, but let's not
vilify our client

10:54.806 --> 10:56.446
before we talk to him.

10:56.471 --> 10:58.250
I hate it when you're reasonable.

10:58.275 --> 10:59.289
Matt Shade.

10:59.314 --> 11:01.877
[Hello, Mr. Shade, this is
Adele Ricci from the Ellard]

11:01.902 --> 11:03.898
[International Exchange Program.]

11:03.923 --> 11:07.007
- Is Jules okay?
- [Yes, Jules is fine.]

11:07.032 --> 11:10.293
[We adore her. But we are
obligated to inform the parents]

11:10.318 --> 11:13.406
- [when a student misses curfew.]
- She did?

11:13.431 --> 11:14.665
Where was she?

11:14.690 --> 11:16.789
[She lost track
of time. I wouldn't worry.]

11:16.814 --> 11:19.493
[It's a first offense and these
things are not uncommon.]

11:19.518 --> 11:21.327
[But we hope it won't be
repeated.]

11:21.352 --> 11:24.202
Absolutely. It won't be. Ever.

11:24.227 --> 11:27.336
- [Good day then, Mr. Shade.]
- Yeah. Thanks for calling.

11:30.004 --> 11:31.608
Okay. Breathe.

11:31.633 --> 11:34.493
Jules is young. She's in Italy.
It's bound to get a little wild.

11:34.518 --> 11:36.819
No. Jules doesn't do "wild."

11:36.844 --> 11:38.955
I'm sure this was just
a mistake, and she'll tell me

11:38.980 --> 11:40.757
all about it when I talk
to her tonight.

11:40.782 --> 11:42.327
Right. Yeah.

11:42.352 --> 11:44.886
It's not like she's
an adventurous teenager

11:44.911 --> 11:47.401
in a fun foreign country
with her super cute boyfriend.

11:47.426 --> 11:50.755
Jules is smart, and she's
a responsible young lady.

11:50.780 --> 11:53.007
On the verge of becoming a woman.

11:53.032 --> 11:56.391
- You take that back.
- No one can. It's biology.

12:05.476 --> 12:07.521
Yes, I have the cash.

12:07.546 --> 12:10.332
- Are you close?
- Did you hear that?

12:10.356 --> 12:12.145
Do you think he's going to meet
the hacker? Maybe he's

12:12.170 --> 12:14.685
- scamming his insurance company.
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

12:14.710 --> 12:16.719
- I'm calling mom.
- And ruin a good thing for her?

12:16.744 --> 12:20.083
Maybe there's nothing to tell.
Come on.

12:24.928 --> 12:26.896
Check it out.

12:26.921 --> 12:28.746
Maybe it's his sister.

12:30.044 --> 12:31.719
In what world? Game of Thrones?

12:31.744 --> 12:34.062
Angie. We don't know
the whole story yet.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.421
You want the story? Rohit's
a big fat lying cheat.

12:36.446 --> 12:37.816
And I'm about to take
him down so hard,

12:37.841 --> 12:40.631
he's gonna need surgery just
to pry himself off the floor.

12:46.352 --> 12:48.867
[It's not just the feeling
of the cobblestones, ]

12:48.892 --> 12:52.492
[it's the smells! Damp plaster
from old buildings, ]

12:52.517 --> 12:55.806
[candle wax, tomatoes
and truffles...]

12:55.878 --> 12:59.213
[And the sounds! <i>Guarda i tuoi</i>
<i>passi, signorina.]</i>

13:00.251 --> 13:03.092
My Italian is a lot rusty, honey.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.389
[Watch your step, miss.]

13:05.423 --> 13:08.427
[Everything sounds so much more
beautiful in Italian.]

13:09.107 --> 13:11.172
- [So what's new with you?]
- I got a phone call

13:11.197 --> 13:13.764
- from the director of your program.
- [Look, Dad.]

13:13.789 --> 13:16.854
[It was nothing, okay?
I was at a restaurant, ]

13:16.889 --> 13:19.842
[and the waiter asked me if I
wanted wine with my dinner, and...]

13:19.874 --> 13:23.509
- [Liam and I kinda said yes.]
- Hold on. You were drinking?

13:23.534 --> 13:25.421
With Liam? What kind of restaurant

13:25.446 --> 13:28.718
- serves wine to 16-year-olds?
- [The Italian kind.]

13:28.743 --> 13:30.664
[Dad, 16-year-olds can drink here.
It's not... ]

13:30.689 --> 13:31.826
[Mr. Shade?]

13:31.865 --> 13:35.718
[Hi. Let me explain.
My parents let me]

13:35.743 --> 13:37.541
[have a sip here
and there at home.]

13:37.566 --> 13:39.945
[So I ordered the wine.]

13:40.193 --> 13:42.140
[Just one glass. And we shared.]

13:42.165 --> 13:44.063
Anything else you'd care
to share with me, Liam?

13:44.088 --> 13:45.360
[We missed curfew, sir.]

13:45.385 --> 13:48.987
[Which was entirely my fault. It
won't happen again. I promise.]

13:49.012 --> 13:52.889
- No. It won't.
- [Dad, that's not exactly...]

13:53.647 --> 13:57.008
[I smell something burning.]
[The carbonara!]

13:57.033 --> 13:58.750
It's the middle of the night
there!

13:58.775 --> 14:02.014
[Dad, everyone eats late in
Europe. I love you. I gotta go.]

14:07.226 --> 14:08.320
Hey! What's up?

14:08.345 --> 14:10.758
[My favourite girl is
four thousand miles away, ]

14:10.783 --> 14:12.836
and her boyfriend is
plying her with alcohol.

14:12.861 --> 14:13.953
[Plying?]

14:14.143 --> 14:16.698
They're drinking wine with dinner.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.602
Ew! Boyfriends are the worst.

14:18.627 --> 14:21.366
[Wait. Did you find out
anything about Rohit?]

14:21.391 --> 14:24.025
The woman we saw?
I traced her license plate.

14:24.050 --> 14:26.824
Turns out her name is Uma
Haldar, and if that last name

14:26.849 --> 14:28.977
sounds familiar it's because
she's been married to Rohit

14:29.002 --> 14:31.484
- [for 36 years!]
- Oh boy.

14:31.509 --> 14:34.409
- I was right, Shade. He's our hacker!
- [Wait.]

14:34.434 --> 14:37.739
Slow down, Angie. People who
commit crimes generally

14:37.764 --> 14:40.408
don't hire PIs to investigate
said crimes.

14:40.433 --> 14:44.009
Yeah. Except he didn't. Nora
did. And I bet you Rohit was

14:44.034 --> 14:46.093
- hella surprised about it.
- [Just because he lied]

14:46.118 --> 14:48.164
[to your mother, doesn't mean
he's our hacker.]

14:48.189 --> 14:51.547
He lied about everything.
Tell him, Zoe.

14:51.572 --> 14:53.710
Our research bender turned up
a mother lode.

14:53.735 --> 14:56.315
Seems Rohit put up bail
three times.

14:56.340 --> 14:59.021
[And he had a criminal lawyer
practically on retainer.]

14:59.046 --> 15:00.810
Hit him with the zinger.

15:00.835 --> 15:03.502
He paid for a drug rehab
program. Twice.

15:04.017 --> 15:07.663
- Wow. You're gonna tell Nora?
- [Well, yeah!]

15:07.688 --> 15:11.314
I mean, I'm gonna try to.
She's on her way here right now.

15:11.339 --> 15:13.500
Listen, don't worry about
the Jules' thing.

15:13.525 --> 15:15.406
- [Okay?]
- Don't worry about Jules?

15:15.431 --> 15:17.452
They're making carbonara!

15:17.477 --> 15:20.510
[That's like a gateway
pasta for... for... ]

15:20.534 --> 15:22.933
What? Dessert?
Take a breath, Shade.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.373
Oh! My mom's here.

15:25.398 --> 15:28.794
- I gotta go.
- I came as fast as I could.

15:29.331 --> 15:31.189
Sit down, mom.

15:35.130 --> 15:36.857
Look, I don't know how
to tell you this,

15:36.882 --> 15:39.525
but I want you to know that
I am here for you, okay?

15:39.550 --> 15:41.338
Angie, you're scaring me.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.271
Rohit's married.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.282
I'm so sorry.

15:48.011 --> 15:51.124
Are you... laughing?

15:51.149 --> 15:52.294
Oh, sweetie!

15:52.319 --> 15:55.735
It's just that you're just
breaking this to me so gently.

15:57.033 --> 16:00.368
- Of course, I know he's married.
- You're dating a married man?

16:00.393 --> 16:02.059
Well. Technically.

16:02.085 --> 16:04.315
Rohit and Uma's parents

16:04.340 --> 16:05.982
arranged their marriage for them.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.302
They were friends

16:07.327 --> 16:10.114
and they thought over time that
their feelings would deepen

16:10.139 --> 16:12.636
but they never really
fell in love.

16:12.780 --> 16:14.339
They stayed together
for their son.

16:14.364 --> 16:15.786
Waiting for the punchline.

16:15.811 --> 16:17.786
They've been apart
for over ten years.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.813
Unless they need to sign a
paper, or Uma has car trouble

16:20.838 --> 16:23.711
like she did today,
he never even sees her.

16:23.736 --> 16:26.035
Fine. Okay! Sure!

16:26.661 --> 16:28.578
What about all his other
secrets then?

16:28.916 --> 16:30.961
The bail. The criminal lawyer.

16:30.986 --> 16:32.798
The drug rehab.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.396
Angela Susan Everett!
My boyfriend hires you to stop

16:37.421 --> 16:39.864
a hack ransom,
and you investigate him?

16:39.889 --> 16:41.480
I'm trying to protect you.

16:41.505 --> 16:43.297
Oh please.

16:43.386 --> 16:45.869
You're always questioning
my choices, my boyfriends,

16:45.894 --> 16:48.273
- my lifestyle, my everything.
- I do not!

16:48.298 --> 16:51.409
- You're doing it right now!
- Fine!

16:51.488 --> 16:53.596
Then where was he
last Thursday, uh?

16:54.173 --> 16:56.328
A cosmetic surgery conference.

16:56.775 --> 16:58.855
- Is that so?
- Huh-uh!

16:58.880 --> 17:00.200
'Cause his credit
card statement says

17:00.225 --> 17:02.034
he was at the Great Lakes Casino.

17:02.059 --> 17:04.223
Explain that one.

17:11.663 --> 17:14.301
Well, what do you have to say?

17:14.416 --> 17:17.411
- Were you at Great Lakes Casino?
- Yes.

17:18.050 --> 17:19.824
You lied to me?

17:19.848 --> 17:23.201
Nora, you know
about my son's past.

17:23.439 --> 17:27.851
He was a troubled teen.
Drugs, arrests, rehab clinics.

17:27.876 --> 17:29.677
That explains the
lawyer and the bail.

17:29.702 --> 17:31.387
But he cleaned himself up,

17:31.498 --> 17:33.060
got a degree in
education - and now he

17:33.085 --> 17:35.308
dedicates his life
to troubled youth.

17:35.333 --> 17:37.267
So where does the casino come in?

17:37.292 --> 17:39.572
He held a charity
fundraiser there.

17:39.597 --> 17:41.870
For that youth clinic
I told you about.

17:41.974 --> 17:44.119
I thought you'd feel uncomfortable

17:44.144 --> 17:46.911
- considering...
- My gambling addiction.

17:48.008 --> 17:49.960
It was stupid of me
not to tell you.

17:49.985 --> 17:53.386
No. No, I completely understand.

17:53.926 --> 17:55.827
I can't believe I...

17:55.852 --> 17:59.142
jumped to such
a ridiculous conclusion.

17:59.167 --> 18:00.953
We'll just head back to work.

18:00.978 --> 18:02.943
You know, I think you
owe Rohit an apology.

18:02.968 --> 18:03.820
No!

18:03.845 --> 18:05.632
- No. It's... It's fine.
- Yes!

18:05.657 --> 18:08.420
Kidnapped! What are you
talking about?

18:08.648 --> 18:11.289
Why didn't you tell me. Someone
has been kidnapped?

18:11.314 --> 18:14.415
- Mommy, I tried telling you...
- No one's been kidnapped, Mrs. Joshi.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.078
Rohit's computers got hacked.

18:16.103 --> 18:18.468
The only things being held for
ransom are his client files.

18:18.493 --> 18:20.211
I've had to do all
the paperwork by hand.

18:20.236 --> 18:21.658
Which is why I've missed so many

18:21.683 --> 18:24.609
- wedding appointments.
- Thank goodness everyone is safe.

18:24.634 --> 18:26.863
Mommy! Stop being so hard on him.

18:26.888 --> 18:29.022
Your brother let us worry
all the way here.

18:29.047 --> 18:31.109
Your fiancé's sister
was sick about it.

18:31.134 --> 18:32.234
Not especially.

18:32.259 --> 18:33.859
Anyway. No more wasting time.

18:33.884 --> 18:36.328
Priya, it's time that you
choose your sari pattern.

18:36.352 --> 18:38.453
Mommy, I actually want to
wear white to the wedding.

18:38.478 --> 18:39.564
All white?

18:39.590 --> 18:40.688
That's bad luck!

18:40.743 --> 18:44.814
You know that Anika and Devan's
parents are very traditional.

18:44.839 --> 18:47.386
My mom's face is literally
going to fall off.

18:47.411 --> 18:50.649
You should both be ashamed.

18:50.674 --> 18:53.727
After all these years, our two
families will be joined.

18:53.752 --> 18:55.517
I know. I'm sorry.

18:55.952 --> 18:57.924
Let's go.

19:00.026 --> 19:02.295
Okay, guys. We are
running out of time.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.032
In a little more than an hour,

19:04.057 --> 19:06.372
that hacker is releasing
those files.

19:07.100 --> 19:10.803
I have a confession.
I withdrew the ransom money.

19:10.971 --> 19:11.930
What?

19:11.955 --> 19:13.988
Good! I think we
should make the drop.

19:14.013 --> 19:15.792
And let the hacker get away
with fifty grand?

19:15.817 --> 19:18.234
I just said we should make
the drop. We're not gonna

19:18.259 --> 19:20.801
let the hacker keep Rohit's money.

19:23.946 --> 19:25.458
Nora wanted to come.

19:25.977 --> 19:28.890
- That must have been a hard no.
- It was.

19:28.915 --> 19:31.166
But I love her spontaneity.

19:32.091 --> 19:33.841
You have some of her...

19:33.866 --> 19:37.908
- impulsiveness in you.
- Not even remotely.

19:38.695 --> 19:41.922
What about that "protest
dress" you wore to your prom?

19:41.947 --> 19:42.773
Please.

19:42.798 --> 19:47.007
I will give you my first born...'s
boyfriend if you tell me more.

19:47.031 --> 19:48.937
Rohit is not going to tell you
a thing about that...

19:48.962 --> 19:53.070
- A garbage bag and duct tape dress.
- I have so many questions.

19:54.804 --> 19:57.813
My best friend in high school could
barely afford a pair of jeans,

19:57.838 --> 20:00.078
nevermind a bedazzled poof
of tulle.

20:00.103 --> 20:02.555
So we made statement dresses,

20:03.132 --> 20:05.109
and a pretty wicked
entrance, I must say.

20:05.134 --> 20:06.180
Wow!

20:06.205 --> 20:09.302
- That's some big heart, lady.
- Nora told me she was

20:09.327 --> 20:11.422
- shocked when she saw you in it.
- Oh yeah!

20:11.447 --> 20:14.844
Her jokes about a banana peel
corsage were hilarious.

20:14.869 --> 20:16.634
She also said she was so proud

20:16.659 --> 20:19.188
to have such a brave
and independent daughter.

20:33.272 --> 20:36.373
Hang on. We got a cyclist.

20:53.578 --> 20:56.346
Who the hell are you?
I work for Lightning Couriers.

20:56.371 --> 20:58.211
- Sure you do.
- We got a call to pick up

20:58.236 --> 20:59.767
a package in the park

20:59.792 --> 21:02.213
and deliver it to someone at
a café a few blocks away.

21:02.238 --> 21:04.330
- I'm hungry. You hungry?
- I could eat.

21:04.355 --> 21:08.288
- Guys!
- I just got a text from Priya. Look.

21:09.454 --> 21:11.943
"Nice try. Ransom's now $100,000.

21:11.968 --> 21:14.898
- Twelve hours. I'll be in touch."
- They must have spotted us.

21:14.923 --> 21:16.956
There goes breakfast.

21:19.075 --> 21:21.373
Sorry, man.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.894
- How could you let this happen?
- Okay, we don't have the client files.

21:28.919 --> 21:30.408
But the hacker doesn't
have their money either.

21:30.433 --> 21:32.282
And we have twelve more hours.

21:32.307 --> 21:35.532
Well, pop the champagne.
I'll put on my dancing shoes.

21:36.114 --> 21:37.783
I'm sorry.

21:37.808 --> 21:39.980
You know me in a crisis.

21:40.377 --> 21:44.404
He's not in any danger, is he?
A physical harm?

21:44.429 --> 21:46.579
Rohit? No. I don't think so.

21:46.938 --> 21:50.114
Mom, do you love him?

21:50.465 --> 21:51.771
Alright!

21:51.796 --> 21:55.404
The courier's story checks out.
And he was hired using

21:55.429 --> 21:57.308
a prepaid credit card.
Untraceable.

21:57.333 --> 22:00.858
He obviously saw you at the
stakeout. Or he followed you.

22:00.883 --> 22:03.583
The courier said that someone,
presumably our hacker,

22:03.608 --> 22:06.513
was at the café. But that was
blocks away from there.

22:06.538 --> 22:09.025
Maybe he had a partner.
Someone watching the bench?

22:09.050 --> 22:10.750
Uh, that's weird.

22:10.775 --> 22:12.552
- What?
- What time did

22:12.577 --> 22:15.608
- the courier show up?
- Around 9:15.

22:15.633 --> 22:17.200
- Why?
- Because according

22:17.225 --> 22:20.943
to Rohit's phone, Priya's text
message came in just before 9.

22:20.968 --> 22:22.768
I guess Rohit didn't notice.

22:22.793 --> 22:24.150
So the hacker knew it was a setup

22:24.175 --> 22:27.552
- before the courier arrived?
- How is that possible?

22:28.053 --> 22:31.934
- I can think of one way.
- Time to call the exterminator.

22:37.077 --> 22:39.294
You really think the hacker
bugged this office?

22:39.319 --> 22:42.434
Gosh. Rohit and I met here after
hours more times

22:42.459 --> 22:46.419
than I can count. I hate
to think what else he heard.

22:46.444 --> 22:49.365
- Ha! Ha!
- Thanks for that image.

22:51.014 --> 22:52.843
Alrighty!

22:52.868 --> 22:55.324
You bird dogs remember the basics?

22:55.349 --> 22:59.578
- Yeah. Outlets, light switches, lamps.
- Paintings, plants, desks.

22:59.603 --> 23:01.622
Super. Let's catch us some bugs.

23:01.647 --> 23:02.725
Let's do this.

23:33.219 --> 23:35.818
- Well?
- Lobby and waiting room is clear.

23:35.843 --> 23:37.810
Hallways and exam rooms are clear.

23:38.304 --> 23:41.735
- It's not clear in here.
- Oh-oh.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.697
Looks like we found some dirt.

23:53.674 --> 23:55.539
Hello, you.

23:57.715 --> 24:01.519
God! Whoever MacGyvered-up this
mess needs a serious talking to.

24:01.544 --> 24:04.112
So our hacker's
no computer genius.

24:04.137 --> 24:05.279
God no.

24:05.304 --> 24:07.866
Any newb could've picked either
of these hacks off the internet.

24:07.891 --> 24:10.950
- What do you mean "either"?
- Technically, you have two.

24:11.292 --> 24:13.107
So the first part of the device

24:13.132 --> 24:15.716
allowed the hacker to gain
control over Rohit's network.

24:15.741 --> 24:16.755
The other part

24:16.780 --> 24:19.153
allowed the hacker to activate
the ransomware remotely.

24:19.178 --> 24:21.536
So they installed
the hack in person,

24:21.591 --> 24:24.387
but didn't activate it until
they were outside the office?

24:24.412 --> 24:27.086
- Correct.
- Which one is the bug?

24:27.692 --> 24:29.091
There's no bug, mom.

24:29.116 --> 24:31.297
- No one was listening in.
- Okay. Okay.

24:31.322 --> 24:33.583
You know, I'm ready to disconnect
this thing when you are.

24:33.608 --> 24:35.592
Wait. Wait, wait.

24:35.617 --> 24:37.153
Can you retrieve the files

24:37.178 --> 24:39.958
but still make it look like the
hacker controls the network?

24:40.795 --> 24:43.853
Uh... Do coders like Reddit
and Mountain Dew?

24:45.913 --> 24:48.837
Here is a list of people
who were at Haldar Harmony

24:48.862 --> 24:51.004
in the days prior to the hack.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.370
Uh!

24:54.661 --> 24:57.719
Staff, clients, technicians...

24:57.744 --> 24:59.609
This is a lot of people
to interview.

24:59.634 --> 25:02.242
If the hacker had
access to Harmony,

25:02.267 --> 25:04.889
maybe they had access
to Rohit's schedule too.

25:04.914 --> 25:06.830
Good point.
The day before the hack,

25:06.855 --> 25:08.948
Rohit was at the casino
fundraiser.

25:09.158 --> 25:11.775
That's a perfect opportunity
to plant the hacking device.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.889
No clients that day, and most
of the staff had the day off.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.787
The only person who came in

25:17.175 --> 25:19.173
was the laser technician.

25:19.198 --> 25:20.665
That sounds promising.

25:20.690 --> 25:23.543
Still doesn't explain how the
hacker knew about the stakeout.

25:23.568 --> 25:25.502
- One lead at a time. Let's go.
- Alright. I'm gonna

25:25.527 --> 25:26.646
meet you guys later.

25:26.671 --> 25:29.937
I got a little Italian situation
I have to take care of.

25:34.823 --> 25:36.943
Shade. It's good to meet you.

25:36.968 --> 25:38.485
Yeah. You too. Thanks
for meeting me last minute.

25:38.509 --> 25:41.207
That's a hell of a handshake
you got there, Matt.

25:41.233 --> 25:43.037
All those years of
stick-handling, hey?

25:43.062 --> 25:43.991
Yeah!

25:44.016 --> 25:46.834
Liam uses any excuse he can
to tell people he knows you.

25:46.859 --> 25:50.100
- Your home is beautiful.
- Wait 'til you try the wine.

25:50.125 --> 25:53.271
Logan! Sorry. We
have a hobby vineyard.

25:53.296 --> 25:54.671
He's always looking for tasters.
Please.

25:54.696 --> 25:56.255
Thanks.

25:57.349 --> 25:59.048
Ha! Ha!

25:59.073 --> 26:01.306
- Thanks.
- Alrighty.

26:04.427 --> 26:06.344
Wow. That's really good!

26:06.369 --> 26:08.740
- How old are your vines?
- They're only five years.

26:08.765 --> 26:10.285
We got lucky.

26:11.401 --> 26:15.755
Look, Matt, we let Liam have
a glass every now and then.

26:15.780 --> 26:16.857
I heard that you were a little

26:16.882 --> 26:18.856
put out about Jules
drinking wine with him.

26:19.090 --> 26:21.373
I was more surprised.

26:21.398 --> 26:22.909
We respect your boundaries.

26:22.934 --> 26:25.489
I've spoken with Liam.
It's not gonna happen again.

26:25.514 --> 26:28.521
Look, Liam and Jules are
both good kids.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.836
It's just, with no parents around,

26:30.861 --> 26:34.724
maybe they're influencing
each other in ways that are

26:34.749 --> 26:36.373
less then positive.

26:36.398 --> 26:39.032
- It's so easy with young love.
- Or like.

26:39.057 --> 26:41.516
Strong, strong like.

26:41.717 --> 26:45.452
Matt, we think Jules is just
the bee's knees.

26:45.525 --> 26:48.372
But I think she may be
pushing Liam a little bit

26:48.397 --> 26:50.377
beyond his comfort zone.

26:50.402 --> 26:53.044
- His comfort zone?
- Jules likes the night life.

26:53.069 --> 26:54.271
I get it. It's Italy.

26:54.296 --> 26:58.286
But if you could talk to her,

26:58.311 --> 27:00.615
that would really
put our minds at ease.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.366
They've missed curfew twice now.

27:02.391 --> 27:06.342
Twice? Ms. Ricci only
mentioned the one time.

27:06.367 --> 27:09.140
Yes, well, that's the only
time she knows about.

27:10.483 --> 27:12.598
Liam tells us everything.

27:16.651 --> 27:18.818
Yeah. I was here last Thursday.

27:19.133 --> 27:21.184
Okay, when you fix
the laser machine,

27:21.226 --> 27:23.521
how much fiddling do you
do with the network here?

27:23.546 --> 27:24.459
None.

27:24.484 --> 27:26.748
I talk to Chip.
Chip talks to the network.

27:26.773 --> 27:28.067
Who's Chip?

27:28.912 --> 27:31.239
For a machine that does
the finest incisions,

27:31.264 --> 27:33.887
VT-1030 sounds so impersonal.

27:33.912 --> 27:34.825
Oh! Okay.

27:34.850 --> 27:38.626
Why don't you walk me through
exactly what you did with Chip?

27:38.650 --> 27:40.964
Okay! I run a diagnostic,

27:40.989 --> 27:42.751
the machine recalibrates like so.

27:42.776 --> 27:46.091
- Then I check the digital log.
- Digital log?

27:46.116 --> 27:48.431
Yeah. Every time Chip's activated,

27:48.456 --> 27:50.637
he records the date,
time, user number.

27:50.662 --> 27:52.731
That information is saved
to a database.

27:52.756 --> 27:54.770
Huh, that's weird.

27:56.414 --> 27:58.494
Someone manually deleted an entry

27:58.519 --> 28:00.739
- from two weeks ago.
- Can you retrieve it?

28:00.764 --> 28:04.476
Chip can do better than that.
He can print it out for you.

28:05.566 --> 28:08.812
What kind of cosmetic surgery
takes place at 11:00pm?

28:08.837 --> 28:11.997
I checked Rohit's schedule.
He was with my mother that night.

28:12.022 --> 28:13.880
Baum-chicka-Baum-Baum...

28:13.905 --> 28:16.150
- Watch it, carbonara.
- Wait.

28:16.175 --> 28:18.450
If Rohit's the only
surgeon at Harmony,

28:18.475 --> 28:21.175
- then whose code is this?
- Rohit's intern?

28:21.416 --> 28:23.890
Corey Rollins. I assume he's
allowed to use the laser.

28:23.915 --> 28:25.786
Only for surgical practice.

28:27.452 --> 28:31.770
Check out the data. Blood type,
allergies... This is a real patient.

28:31.943 --> 28:35.559
So he performs a secret
surgery, then deletes the entry.

28:35.584 --> 28:38.208
But why hold the
clinic's files hostage?

28:38.233 --> 28:39.026
<i>Money?</i>

28:39.051 --> 28:40.411
To open his own practice?

28:40.436 --> 28:42.989
He was complaining that Rohit
won't let him do anything.

28:43.698 --> 28:46.434
I think it's time we paid our
young surgeon-in-training a visit.

28:51.105 --> 28:53.903
You think I'm the hacker?
I would never do that to Rohit.

28:53.928 --> 28:54.958
Come on.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.894
You're ready for the big time
and he's still "Wax on, wax off."

28:57.919 --> 29:00.918
It's not like that. I have
nothing but respect

29:00.943 --> 29:02.442
- <i>for him.</i>
- Really?

29:02.728 --> 29:05.494
Is that why you're doing
surgeries on the side?

29:08.982 --> 29:10.499
Not getting paid enough?

29:11.058 --> 29:14.058
It was one procedure,
and it wasn't for money.

29:14.083 --> 29:14.958
Sure it wasn't.

29:14.983 --> 29:17.909
So were you sneaking in your own
clients or just stealing Rohit's?

29:17.934 --> 29:20.557
You're gonna steal his staff too?
Maybe his receptionist?

29:20.582 --> 29:22.208
You leave Priya out of this!

29:23.301 --> 29:25.126
She had nothing to do with the hack.

29:26.348 --> 29:27.383
Or she had

29:27.408 --> 29:29.716
- everything to do with it.
- Huh-uh!

29:31.599 --> 29:34.261
Corey, are you and Priya
having an affair?

29:34.286 --> 29:36.985
Is that why you're so mad
about the wedding?

29:39.474 --> 29:40.902
It's not an affair.

29:40.927 --> 29:42.666
We're in love!

29:42.866 --> 29:46.394
And it happened long before the
charade of that arranged marriage.

29:46.419 --> 29:48.932
Whoa. Record scratch. Arranged?

29:48.957 --> 29:51.293
Priya and Devan's grandmothers
were best friends.

29:51.356 --> 29:53.649
Apparently their dying wish was
to see them together.

29:53.674 --> 29:55.864
Priya never took it seriously.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.176
Devan was a family friend.

29:58.201 --> 29:59.560
If she doesn't want
to marry the guy,

29:59.585 --> 30:00.989
why doesn't she just
tell her parents?

30:01.014 --> 30:03.099
A matchmaker compared
their birthdates

30:03.492 --> 30:05.270
and said they were
a perfect match.

30:05.295 --> 30:08.060
Everyone got so excited, Priya
didn't know how to back out.

30:08.085 --> 30:09.888
The surgery you did...

30:10.176 --> 30:11.731
What is a "thenar crease"?

30:11.756 --> 30:13.044
It's the lifeline.

30:13.069 --> 30:15.336
As in "phone a friend" lifeline?

30:15.714 --> 30:18.192
Like palm of your hand lifeline.

30:19.075 --> 30:20.737
We need to talk to Priya.

30:22.317 --> 30:23.568
Hold on a second.

30:23.593 --> 30:25.794
- What am I missing?
- Think about it.

30:26.046 --> 30:28.794
Priya loves Corey, but she's
stuck in a prearranged marriage.

30:28.819 --> 30:31.323
So she goes to him and gets him
to do a surgery on her hand

30:31.348 --> 30:33.161
- What for?
- Best guess?

30:33.186 --> 30:36.560
To scare off her future in-laws,
Devan's superstitious parents

30:36.585 --> 30:39.209
who believe he and Priya are
predestined to be together.

30:39.234 --> 30:42.134
She scars her lifeline so
they'll call off the wedding.

30:42.159 --> 30:44.731
But what does all this have
to do with the hack ransom?

30:44.756 --> 30:46.280
If I'm right,

30:46.319 --> 30:47.847
everything.

30:50.661 --> 30:52.403
So for an arranged marriage,

30:52.428 --> 30:54.356
this could be pretty serious
stuff.

30:54.381 --> 30:56.106
Not if it's kept under wraps.

30:56.538 --> 30:58.146
But someone finds out

30:58.171 --> 31:00.982
and goes after Rohit because
they think he did the surgery.

31:01.532 --> 31:04.317
Exactly! Which means
the hacker has to be someone

31:04.342 --> 31:06.708
- in Priya's family.
- Or Devan's.

31:06.733 --> 31:08.958
All we have to do is get
everyone in one place.

31:08.983 --> 31:10.869
Yeah! Like that's going to happen.

31:15.489 --> 31:18.548
I think we are seriously
underdressed.

31:18.573 --> 31:21.504
I think that's a serious
understatement.

31:22.141 --> 31:25.567
Hi! We're so sorry.
Is this the wedding?

31:25.592 --> 31:28.176
It's the official engagement
party. Devan's parents came

31:28.201 --> 31:31.082
from India today. He's over
there with Anika.

31:31.496 --> 31:34.457
Sunesh, go fill the drinks!
Are you here

31:34.482 --> 31:37.426
- about Dr. Haldar's case?
- We stopped the hack.

31:37.451 --> 31:39.340
- His files are secure.
- We can come back later.

31:39.365 --> 31:42.600
No, please stay. Priya will
want to hear the news from you.

31:42.625 --> 31:44.752
But you'll have to
wait until after

31:44.777 --> 31:47.388
the engagement rings are exchanged.
Come!

31:53.220 --> 31:56.452
Devan Pandey,
the Joshi family welcomes you.

31:56.477 --> 31:58.875
Priya Joshi, the Pandey
family welcomes you.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.132
And I welcome all of you

32:00.157 --> 32:01.625
to this auspicious occasion.

32:01.742 --> 32:04.375
I've been a matchmaker
for many years,

32:04.400 --> 32:07.218
and I have never seen
such a perfect match.

32:07.630 --> 32:10.164
Even their planets were lined up
at their births.

32:10.283 --> 32:13.562
And according to their lifelines
and loveliness,

32:13.592 --> 32:16.519
they will live long
and prosperous lives.

32:26.249 --> 32:28.662
What is it?

32:28.687 --> 32:32.249
I don't understand. Priya's
lifeline, it's been changed!

32:32.274 --> 32:35.408
- What?
- But how is this possible?

32:35.560 --> 32:38.081
Priya, do you have
something to say?

32:38.730 --> 32:40.733
Only that she loves Devan.

32:40.758 --> 32:42.171
Right, Priya?

32:43.100 --> 32:44.429
I...

32:45.297 --> 32:46.717
I...

32:47.756 --> 32:49.427
I'm sorry.

32:49.858 --> 32:51.897
Your daughter casts
shame on our family!

32:51.922 --> 32:52.969
No!

32:52.994 --> 32:55.190
This superstitious stuff has
gone too far.

32:55.873 --> 32:58.772
- Superstitious stuff?
- Go after her, Devan.

32:58.797 --> 33:01.897
I'm sure she's only nervous.
You can fix this.

33:02.749 --> 33:04.784
I can't. I'm sorry.

33:04.809 --> 33:06.819
I never wanted
this marriage either.

33:07.507 --> 33:10.190
- What?
- I'm in love with someone else!

33:16.778 --> 33:18.569
The planets were aligned.
I tell you.

33:18.594 --> 33:20.038
The planets were aligned.

33:21.328 --> 33:24.331
I gotta say, as far as
engagement parties go,

33:24.356 --> 33:25.624
this one is pretty great.

33:25.649 --> 33:27.965
No! It's your fault!
It's your fault!

33:30.647 --> 33:33.678
Everybody seemed genuinely surprised
about the altered lifeline.

33:33.703 --> 33:35.257
Yeah. But the hacker
has to be here.

33:35.282 --> 33:37.562
It's the only explanation
that makes any sense.

33:39.167 --> 33:41.296
Guys, I'm so sorry
about the drama.

33:41.406 --> 33:43.917
You haven't seen Sunesh, have you?

33:43.942 --> 33:45.827
- Sunesh.
- We haven't seen him

33:45.852 --> 33:47.811
since we told Mrs. Joshi
we solved the case

33:47.836 --> 33:49.452
just a few minutes ago.

33:49.764 --> 33:51.545
The ransom. He was there

33:51.570 --> 33:53.843
when Rohit said he was gonna go
to the bank withdraw the money.

33:53.868 --> 33:56.334
He also overheard us saying
we were gonna sting the drop

33:56.359 --> 33:59.702
- when we were at the clinic.
- That's why we never found a bug.

33:59.727 --> 34:01.666
Oh. Hey, mom.

34:01.691 --> 34:05.645
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Okay.

34:05.670 --> 34:07.462
Don't worry, we're on our way.

34:07.702 --> 34:09.889
Nora was on the phone with
Rohit when he was closing up

34:09.915 --> 34:11.444
at Harmony then the phone died.

34:11.469 --> 34:13.478
Rohit still has the ransom
money at his office.

34:13.503 --> 34:14.561
Sunesh knows about it.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.616
Are you kidding me?
I'm coming with you, guys.

34:16.641 --> 34:18.681
- No, Priya.
- You don't understand.

34:18.706 --> 34:21.226
I have to. This is all my fault.

34:32.963 --> 34:36.553
- Wait here.
- We have to wait here.

34:39.775 --> 34:41.732
We shouldn't have let them come.

34:41.757 --> 34:44.963
I wasn't gonna come between
a mamma bear and her cubs.

34:45.737 --> 34:48.688
Rohit?

34:48.713 --> 34:51.130
- Rohit?
- I'm in here!

34:57.822 --> 34:59.556
- Hey!
- Are you okay?

34:59.581 --> 35:02.193
Someone pushed me in the closet.
I think they're still here.

35:02.218 --> 35:04.019
I didn't see their face.

35:13.287 --> 35:15.573
We know you're in there, Sunesh.

35:18.695 --> 35:20.577
Let go of me!

35:20.602 --> 35:22.507
- Take it easy!
- Sunesh!

35:25.206 --> 35:26.929
If you hadn't have
scarred my sister,

35:26.954 --> 35:28.322
none of this would have happened!

35:28.347 --> 35:32.091
- What scar?
- Have you gone completely insane?

35:32.116 --> 35:35.719
Dr. Haldar did nothing, okay?
It was Corey who did the surgery.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.007
- I lied to you.
- What surgery?

35:40.391 --> 35:43.293
Priya had the lifeline
on her palm shortened.

35:43.318 --> 35:46.031
Sunesh picked her up that night,
thinking she was just working late.

35:46.056 --> 35:49.273
But he heard about the surgery
and he blamed you.

35:50.528 --> 35:53.630
Man, I messed up.

35:53.655 --> 35:55.921
- You really did.
- It's just...

35:55.946 --> 35:59.200
When you changed your fate,
you changed mine too.

35:59.609 --> 36:01.328
Priya! Rohit!

36:01.353 --> 36:03.726
- I'm so dead!
- Sunesh. Please.

36:03.751 --> 36:06.498
Just talk to us, okay?

36:06.523 --> 36:09.501
What do you mean by changing
your fate, too?

36:11.041 --> 36:12.687
Everything's okay.

36:12.712 --> 36:15.086
- No one got hurt.
- Nothing was stolen.

36:16.515 --> 36:18.331
You're the hacker, son?

36:18.356 --> 36:20.297
You're not the son I know.

36:20.322 --> 36:22.723
- This is a travesty.
- Mom, leave him alone.

36:22.748 --> 36:24.600
It's not his fault.

36:26.299 --> 36:27.881
It's mine.

36:28.162 --> 36:30.624
You think the lifeline on my
hand just changed on its own?

36:30.649 --> 36:31.422
What?

36:31.447 --> 36:34.601
- I scarred it on purpose.
- Why did you do that?

36:34.626 --> 36:36.593
An arranged marriage worked
for you.

36:36.618 --> 36:38.613
You assumed it would work for me.

36:42.343 --> 36:44.198
I'm in love with Corey.

36:45.015 --> 36:49.124
- The white boy?
- I prefer Scottish-Ukrainian.

36:51.877 --> 36:55.756
- You came.
- I love you.

36:57.094 --> 36:59.395
I'd never let you face this
on your own.

36:59.420 --> 37:01.678
I just don't understand this.

37:01.736 --> 37:04.704
Look, I thought that
if I compromised my lifeline

37:04.729 --> 37:06.312
the Pandeys would call off
the wedding

37:06.337 --> 37:08.101
and I wouldn't embarrass you.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.730
It doesn't excuse
what your brother did.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.316
But it does explain it.

37:14.692 --> 37:17.777
Sunesh, why don't you tell
them what you told us?

37:20.809 --> 37:23.031
My whole life, you've been
telling me

37:23.056 --> 37:25.070
I'm a disappointment.

37:25.193 --> 37:27.078
I guess I started to believe it.

37:27.540 --> 37:30.916
Then I met someone who makes me
feel exactly the opposite.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.210
I love her,

37:33.235 --> 37:35.378
and she loves me.

37:35.403 --> 37:37.544
I was going to ask her
to marry me,

37:37.569 --> 37:40.320
- but all that's ruined.
- Why?

37:41.024 --> 37:44.148
Because her family won't have
anything to do with me now.

37:44.254 --> 37:47.974
You are a Joshi.
An excellent prospect.

37:48.118 --> 37:49.976
Who is this girl?

37:50.976 --> 37:53.143
- It's...
- It's me.

37:55.023 --> 37:58.437
- Anika?
- Anika?

38:06.203 --> 38:09.898
When Sunesh told me that Priya was
totally sabotaging the engagement,

38:09.923 --> 38:12.759
I knew that mom and dad would
never allow us to get married.

38:12.784 --> 38:15.331
- We were going to run away.
- It was my idea.

38:15.356 --> 38:16.437
But we needed money.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.881
Look, I told her
I'd take care of it.

38:20.474 --> 38:23.042
I wanted to do
something noble for once.

38:23.450 --> 38:25.054
Aww!

38:25.260 --> 38:29.336
- Mom! He hacked your boyfriend.
- I know! But it was for love!

38:29.361 --> 38:31.309
My boy.

38:37.972 --> 38:39.609
Dr. Haldar...

38:40.702 --> 38:42.530
I am so sorry.

38:42.789 --> 38:44.698
What I did was stupid.

38:44.982 --> 38:47.602
I have no right to ask you
to forgive my son,

38:47.815 --> 38:52.078
but one father to another,
I ask you, please.

38:53.015 --> 38:57.531
Our kids mess up and we pick
them up. 'Cause we love 'em.

38:57.556 --> 38:59.504
Yes, we do.

39:05.324 --> 39:08.141
Everyone, there is so much food
in the house.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.974
Please join us.

39:12.159 --> 39:14.680
I am sure that Sunesh and Anika

39:14.705 --> 39:16.705
may want to discuss an engagement.

39:16.730 --> 39:20.067
A long engagement.

39:23.734 --> 39:25.606
Do you like Indian food?

39:25.631 --> 39:28.232
I make a mean dal.

39:28.257 --> 39:31.274
- We'll see about that.
- Yes, ma'am.

39:45.702 --> 39:48.308
You know, it's funny.
It seems like no matter

39:48.333 --> 39:51.692
where people are from, parents
and kids drive each other crazy.

39:51.717 --> 39:53.725
Yeah.

39:54.114 --> 39:55.748
Aww.

39:55.941 --> 39:57.937
Now, that's love.

40:00.413 --> 40:02.192
I'll get the car.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.519
I'll meet you at your place?

40:07.544 --> 40:09.013
Yes.

40:17.838 --> 40:20.533
- He's a good man.
- Yes, he is.

40:21.395 --> 40:24.721
And that butt, you could
bounce a quarter off it.

40:25.382 --> 40:27.383
You're ruining this.

40:34.377 --> 40:39.618
[Dad, I didn't miss curfew.
I missed two curfews.]

40:39.643 --> 40:42.891
- I heard.
- [Just let me get this out.]

40:42.916 --> 40:47.403
[Everything here is incredible.]

40:47.575 --> 40:52.280
[But a couple of weeks ago I discovered
BioClub, then Lala Lounge, ]

40:52.305 --> 40:55.671
- [then 720 Caffè.]
- Please tell me those are restaurants,

40:55.696 --> 40:57.729
- galleries.
- [Clubs.]

40:57.754 --> 40:59.958
[Where some of the best DJs play.]

41:00.272 --> 41:01.705
[The way they layer]

41:01.730 --> 41:05.571
[sound and music, I can feel the
vibrations in my whole body.]

41:05.596 --> 41:09.155
[It's a total art form,
and when I hear it, ]

41:09.180 --> 41:12.929
[it's like I'm a
whole new person.]

41:13.472 --> 41:15.474
[Does that sound dumb?]

41:15.853 --> 41:18.059
No, honey.

41:19.108 --> 41:20.694
It sounds amazing.

41:20.719 --> 41:24.368
[Thing is DJs don't usually
start until after curfew.]

41:24.656 --> 41:27.360
[I would've told you but
I didn't want it to end.]

41:27.476 --> 41:29.864
Well look, honey,

41:31.069 --> 41:33.813
I don't like the idea of you
going to clubs

41:33.838 --> 41:35.837
at night without an adult.

41:35.862 --> 41:38.529
- [I know, dad. I'm sorry.]
- But...

41:40.258 --> 41:43.688
Maybe I can talk to Ms. Ricci
about extending your curfew

41:43.713 --> 41:45.609
- a couple of nights a week.
- [Really?]

41:45.634 --> 41:48.689
With a real chaperone,
not just with Liam.

41:48.714 --> 41:51.775
[I will. I will! <i>Ti amo, papà.]</i>

41:51.800 --> 41:55.493
Now that's some Italian that I
understand. I love you too, honey.

41:55.518 --> 41:58.752
[About Liam... You kind
of owe him an apology.]

41:58.777 --> 42:00.810
Uh, yeah, well...

42:00.835 --> 42:02.480
He's in the kitchen. I'll get him.

42:02.505 --> 42:05.321
Honey, you're breaking up!
Honey, I'm losing you!

42:10.923 --> 42:12.990
That was serious fun!

42:13.511 --> 42:16.612
My arms actually hurt
from carrying all those bags.

42:17.716 --> 42:19.412
- Do you want a beer?
- Oh. Darling,

42:19.437 --> 42:22.010
I think we've earned ourselves
something a little classier. Don't you?

42:22.035 --> 42:24.208
- Box wine?
- That's my girl.

42:25.354 --> 42:29.533
- So, Corey and Priya got engaged.
- That's great news.

42:29.682 --> 42:31.775
I mean, I guess once
the secret was out,

42:31.800 --> 42:33.689
there was nothing
holding them back.

42:33.978 --> 42:36.056
Speaking of...

42:36.246 --> 42:40.671
Why all the secrecy surrounding
your very cute

42:40.696 --> 42:43.479
and super successful boyfriend?

42:44.241 --> 42:46.384
Well, I figured if I'm
gonna be a screw-up,

42:46.409 --> 42:48.859
I might as well do it
without an audience this time.

42:49.791 --> 42:53.079
You're not a screw-up, mom.
Besides,

42:53.120 --> 42:55.400
based on what you and Rohit
just went through, I mean,

42:55.760 --> 42:57.659
maybe this is the real deal.

42:57.684 --> 42:59.118
You think?

42:59.743 --> 43:01.876
- What about you?
- Hey.

43:01.901 --> 43:04.127
I know it's last minute,
but you two wouldn't wanna

43:04.152 --> 43:06.890
go see a DJ spin tonight
with me, would you?

43:06.915 --> 43:08.783
Are you using words
you don't know again?

43:08.808 --> 43:10.839
Jules is suddenly into the scene.

43:10.932 --> 43:13.166
- No. I'm going to tap out.
- Come on.

43:13.191 --> 43:16.345
Call Rohit! We'll make it
a foursome! I have questions.

43:16.588 --> 43:20.283
You know what, so do I. Like,
what exactly are his intentions?

43:20.308 --> 43:21.809
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

43:22.054 --> 43:23.977
You're not serious.

43:24.969 --> 43:27.462
Ha! Ha! You guys!
