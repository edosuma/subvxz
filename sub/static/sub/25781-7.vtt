01:07.817 --> 01:10.570
I can't believe it.
We're finally back to Earth.

01:10.987 --> 01:13.656
Well, what are we waiting for?

01:23.249 --> 01:25.585
I'll see if I can get a message
out to my dad.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.338
Dad, it's me, Pidge. Do you copy?

01:28.421 --> 01:31.424
We're back in Earth's solar system,
and heading home now.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.263
To any beings
who receive this message...

01:37.347 --> 01:38.515
Dad, you're okay.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.351
-How's Mom and Matt? Is he with you?
-Planet Earth has been...

01:41.434 --> 01:42.685
Most of the citizens...

01:42.769 --> 01:45.188
Hold on, let me try to get a clear signal.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.065
- ...have been captured.
-What?

01:47.148 --> 01:48.900
Who's captured? Dad, what are you saying?

01:48.983 --> 01:51.277
Those of us remaining
are making our last stand.

01:51.694 --> 01:54.948
If you get this message,
please get word to Voltron.

01:55.031 --> 01:57.659
We need help.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.499
Guys, are you seeing this?

02:04.582 --> 02:06.668
To any beings
who receive this message...

02:06.751 --> 02:07.919
Oh, no.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.839
...Planet Earth has been overrun
by the Galra.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.007
The Galra have invaded Earth.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.926
Most of the citizens have been captured.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.595
Those of us remaining
are making our last stand.

02:18.930 --> 02:22.267
If you get this message,
please get word to Voltron.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.852
We need help.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.565
It's not a reply. It's a distress signal.

02:29.941 --> 02:30.942
Dad.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.040
Admiral Sanda, how long have I--?

02:46.124 --> 02:48.126
It's been about a week since you landed.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.712
Sorry, we've had you under
for most of the time.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.798
-A week?
-We had to run tests.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.551
You spent years in an alien environment.

02:56.634 --> 03:00.305
Look, Sam, the joint chiefs are eager
to hear what you have to tell us.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.600
Tell the chiefs
I'll debrief when I'm ready.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.977
There's someone I need to see first.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.075
Sam.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.876
Colleen, I've missed you so much.

03:30.585 --> 03:34.339
I thought you were dead.
I thought I'd never see you again.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.217
You're squeezing me pretty tight.

03:37.717 --> 03:42.055
Being abducted by aliens didn't kill me,
but I think you might.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.433
-Aliens?
-On the Kerberos mission.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.478
Matt, Shiro and I
were taken by hostile aliens.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.979
So Matt is with you?

03:50.521 --> 03:54.567
No, but he's alive and safe.
So is Katie. They're together.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.029
Last time I saw them, they were just
outside the planet Olkarion.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.072
They saved me.

03:59.948 --> 04:03.159
There was a device on my pod,
a transmitter. Where is it?

04:03.243 --> 04:07.038
I can use it to contact my children
and the other Paladins, cadets.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.582
I'm afraid we can't allow you
to broadcast yet.

04:09.666 --> 04:14.003
We need more information before you start
sending messages into deep space.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.589
Any contact with alien species
needs to be run through

04:16.673 --> 04:17.798
the appropriate channels.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.135
We need to be sure you're not putting
Earth in danger, Sam.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.722
I don't care about your channels.
I want to talk to my children.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.849
And you will, soon.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.310
We just wanna debrief you first.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.478
Tell them what you know,

04:30.561 --> 04:32.855
then we can talk to our children
and get you home.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.858
I'm afraid we can't allow Sam
to leave the premises.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.402
We're not prepared to tell the world

04:37.485 --> 04:40.446
about the existence of alien life
just yet.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.991
Remember, everyone thinks you're dead.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.535
So you're holding me like a prisoner?

04:45.743 --> 04:50.039
Not a prisoner. You're free to move about
within the Garrison grounds.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.624
Just until we're ready.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.669
If he's staying, I'm staying too.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.463
I'm afraid you don't have
the clearance, Colleen.

04:57.755 --> 05:00.591
This is the only family I have left.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.260
You'll get me the clearance.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.056
Here's what we know.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.976
Two years ago,
during your Kerberos mission,

05:10.059 --> 05:13.229
our scans picked up an anomaly
at your location.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.149
Minutes later, we lost contact with you
and the rest of the crew.

05:16.607 --> 05:20.403
In the immediate aftermath,
we intercepted a transmission.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.947
We found
these primitive scientists.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.366
I don't think they know anything useful.

05:25.450 --> 05:29.245
Take them back to the main fleet
for interrogation.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.957
The Druids will find out what they know.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.335
That last voice is Zarkon,

05:35.585 --> 05:39.255
the emperor of an advanced
hostile alien race known as the Galra.

05:39.338 --> 05:42.675
-How advanced?
-And how do you know they're hostile?

05:44.719 --> 05:47.805
Do you have the device I asked for?
The one from my pod?

05:49.474 --> 05:50.641
Bring it to him.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.233
Before I left, I downloaded
as much information as I could

05:59.317 --> 06:01.069
from the Castle of Lions.

06:01.152 --> 06:04.989
For 10,000 years,
Zarkon has been expanding his empire,

06:05.073 --> 06:07.450
conquering vast swaths of the universe

06:07.533 --> 06:11.496
and harnessing its quintessence
in order to survive and maintain power.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.164
Quintessence?

06:13.581 --> 06:16.334
It's an energy generated by living beings.

06:16.417 --> 06:21.255
- You mean certain alien beings?
- No. Quintessence is within us all.

06:22.298 --> 06:25.468
Impossible. We've never come across
anything like that.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.763
Maybe because this is beyond the realm
of what you think you know.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.225
Have you ever traveled faster
than the speed of light?

06:32.308 --> 06:34.977
Have you ever seen a living creature
bio-hack nature?

06:35.061 --> 06:38.189
Have you ever come face to face
with an alien warlord

06:38.272 --> 06:41.484
who's older than the entirety
of human civilization?

06:43.194 --> 06:47.782
Well, I have.
And I assure you, it's all real.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.992
Following our abduction,

06:50.076 --> 06:53.496
Shiro, Matt and I were taken
by Galra scouts to the main fleet

06:53.579 --> 06:54.914
where we were interrogated.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.416
After that, we were split up.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.710
I spent the next year at a remote outpost,

06:59.794 --> 07:03.131
working alongside other captive
scientists researching

07:03.214 --> 07:06.759
and creating new technologies
to be used by the Galra.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.511
I later learned that Shiro and Matt

07:08.594 --> 07:11.139
had been sent to fight
in the gladiator pits.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.935
Matt would have been killed,
but Shiro, he saved my son's life.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.734
Later, Matt was rescued
from a work camp by alien rebels.

07:23.818 --> 07:27.989
He now works alongside them,
fighting back against the Galra.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.199
During his time on Zarkon's command ship,

07:30.283 --> 07:34.912
Shiro discovered that Zarkon was looking
for a super weapon hidden on Earth.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.707
Shiro escaped to get the weapon first.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.793
That must be when Lieutenant Shirogane
returned to Earth.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.003
That's right.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.508
Following Garrison protocol,

07:47.592 --> 07:52.221
we placed Lieutenant Takeshi Shirogane
under mandatory quarantine,

07:52.638 --> 07:56.392
but he managed to escape
with the aid of several Garrison cadets.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.604
We later found out the one known
as Pidge Gunderson

07:59.687 --> 08:01.522
was your daughter, Katie Holt,

08:01.606 --> 08:03.774
who had illegally enrolled
in the cadet program

08:03.858 --> 08:05.818
under an assumed identity.

08:05.902 --> 08:09.864
The following day,
the Blue Lion appeared on our radars.

08:09.947 --> 08:13.159
Long-range sensors tracked the UFO
to the edge of our solar system

08:13.242 --> 08:15.953
traveling at speeds we've never achieved.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.499
It disappeared along with the ship.
That was the last activity we had

08:19.582 --> 08:22.418
until your pod arrived on Earth
a month ago.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.922
So that Blue Lion,
that was the super weapon?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.342
Part of it. The super weapon
is known as Voltron.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.345
It's made up of five mechanical lions.

08:32.428 --> 08:35.056
As fate would have it,
when Shiro crashed on Earth,

08:35.139 --> 08:38.017
those same Garrison students
that got him out of quarantine

08:38.100 --> 08:42.855
became the pilots, or Paladins,
of the five lions of Voltron.

08:48.152 --> 08:52.615
The Paladins are doing everything they can
to protect the universe from the Galra.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.743
But we must begin
to bolster Earth's defenses now,

08:55.826 --> 08:58.412
or we do not stand a chance.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.874
War is coming.

09:02.708 --> 09:06.337
So this Zarkon,
you think he'll attack Earth?

09:06.629 --> 09:11.384
No. Zarkon is dead,
but the Galra Empire is not stopping.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.219
There are factions fighting for control

09:13.302 --> 09:16.430
and looking to dominate
their own sections of the universe.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.600
Without a clear leader,
things are worse than before.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.102
So what do we do?

09:21.394 --> 09:24.438
We hold a conference and announce
what we know to the world.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.691
Absolutely not.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.484
They need to know.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.112
And if we can bring the world's
top minds together,

09:31.195 --> 09:32.238
it might mean the difference--

09:32.321 --> 09:34.198
If we told the world
there was an imminent attack,

09:34.282 --> 09:36.033
we'd set off a global panic.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.994
But there will be an attack.

09:38.202 --> 09:42.498
When? How will the attack happen?
Is there a plan to stop it?

09:42.999 --> 09:44.542
None of these things have been discussed.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.127
None of these things have been
thought through.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.379
And until they are,
we're not going to be responsible

09:48.462 --> 09:50.756
for sending the world into disarray.

09:51.632 --> 09:55.177
If you would allow me to contact Katie
and the Paladins right now,

09:55.261 --> 09:57.722
we could begin to answer those questions.

09:58.639 --> 09:59.849
Very well.

10:01.934 --> 10:05.104
This is Sam Holt
calling the Paladins of Voltron.

10:05.187 --> 10:07.398
I'm on Earth. Please respond.

10:10.234 --> 10:14.780
-Pidge, this is Dad. Come in.
-Katie, it's your mom. Are you there?

10:16.532 --> 10:18.492
The transmission's not being received.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.995
There might be interference.
We need to keep trying.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.331
We can have someone send out
regular transmissions

10:23.414 --> 10:25.416
around the clock until we hear from them.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.669
But in the meantime, we stay quiet.

10:28.961 --> 10:32.923
Very well. But we should at least
begin preparations.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.009
We already have.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.639
We've been studying the ship

10:39.722 --> 10:41.849
that Shiro crash landed in
for the last year,

10:42.475 --> 10:45.311
and we've begun research
on the ship you arrived in.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.022
We thought the technology
would be exactly the same,

10:48.105 --> 10:50.524
but that's not the case.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.111
That's because one is Galran
and the other, Altean,

10:54.195 --> 10:56.947
created by two different alien species.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.493
- So did you get it airborne?
- Unfortunately, no.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.454
We got the nav system
and other instruments turned on

11:03.537 --> 11:05.206
by powering them externally,

11:05.289 --> 11:08.250
but the power it would take to fly them
is unsustainable.

11:08.751 --> 11:12.630
Hmm. The crystal must have been damaged
on entry if you couldn't power it.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.173
Crystal?

11:14.590 --> 11:17.927
It's the main energy source
for most alien spacecraft.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.805
If you haven't been able
to get it running,

11:20.888 --> 11:22.681
then what have you been doing with it?

11:22.765 --> 11:25.267
We created a simulator
based on the controls

11:25.351 --> 11:28.354
so that when we figure out how
to integrate the tech into our own ships,

11:28.437 --> 11:29.980
we'll be ready to fly.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.988
Commander Holt, I'd like to introduce you
to the best pilots

11:38.072 --> 11:40.616
to come out of the Galaxy Garrison
in the last year.

11:40.699 --> 11:45.830
These are officers Griffin, Rizavi,
Kinkade, and Leifsdottir.

11:46.956 --> 11:51.961
They're young, but their ability to adapt
to new flying techniques is a step above.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.047
On behalf of my squadron,
it's an honor to meet you, sir.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.300
I've got them running drills
in the simulator five days a week.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.053
They can take just about anything
you can throw at them.

12:01.137 --> 12:04.265
Good. Now it's time to get them
out of the simulator

12:04.348 --> 12:05.975
and flying these things for real.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.144
But they aren't working, sir.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.604
Then we better get them working.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.869
No way.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.048
When can we fly them, sir?

12:38.132 --> 12:40.092
You're gonna be flying ships much faster

12:40.176 --> 12:42.636
and much more maneuverable
than this in no time.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.554
Sir?

12:44.013 --> 12:46.265
This is just an Altean shuttle pod.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.893
The engine and functions
are extremely basic.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.562
If we're going to defend the planet
against the Galra,

12:51.645 --> 12:53.564
we're going to need better ships.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.275
When I was enslaved by the Galra,

12:56.358 --> 12:58.194
I was forced to work on technologies

12:58.277 --> 13:01.822
that are a hundred times more complex
than a simple pod.

13:02.239 --> 13:07.328
And after I regrouped with the Paladins,
I continued learning alongside the Olkari,

13:07.411 --> 13:11.582
some of the most amazing engineers
I've ever had the honor to work with.

13:12.416 --> 13:15.961
They taught me everything I know
about integrating technologies.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.465
These are Altean schematics.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.218
We're gonna use these
to upgrade our weapons,

13:22.301 --> 13:25.638
build new ships,
and create a defense for Earth.

13:26.013 --> 13:30.184
Engineers will be in charge of salvaging
what they can from the pods.

13:30.267 --> 13:33.229
Re-purposing parts
is of the utmost importance.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.276
Our pilots must get out of the simulators

13:39.360 --> 13:42.321
and into real ships
powered by crystal technology

13:42.404 --> 13:46.075
if they hope to stand a chance
against Galran battle tactics.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.718
It's gonna be a steep
learning curve, but I know they'll get it.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.931
The Garrison will become the epicenter

14:09.014 --> 14:13.102
of technological advances
beyond what this world has ever seen.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.527
In the meantime,
we will continue our attempts

14:21.610 --> 14:23.863
to contact Matt and the Paladins.

14:23.946 --> 14:27.992
It's imperative that we find out
what's happening beyond our galaxy.

14:32.913 --> 14:36.917
There is a war coming,
and we need to be prepared.

14:47.511 --> 14:51.765
- Sorry, guess I'm too quick.
- Not for my micro-pulse boosters.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.493
How's the response time
compared to the previous generation?

15:11.577 --> 15:13.412
Instantaneous, sir.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.373
It's like it knows what I wanna do
before I think it.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.295
It's amazing what you've done
in just over a year.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.088
We've done it together.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.884
Sir, you're needed
in the communications room immediately.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.013
It's Matt. He contacted us.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.350
- Mom, is that Dad?
- He just got here.

15:34.683 --> 15:35.935
Matt, are you okay?

15:36.018 --> 15:38.228
I've been trying to contact you
and Katie for months.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.439
Where are you? What's going on?

15:40.522 --> 15:43.442
-So, you didn't hear yet?
-Hear what?

15:44.693 --> 15:46.862
Mom, Dad,

15:46.946 --> 15:50.157
no one has seen or heard from the Paladins
in the last six months.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.201
-No.
-Katie.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.162
What happened?

15:55.663 --> 15:57.247
No one is really sure.

15:57.581 --> 16:01.752
There are rumors that Voltron fought
Lotor, then they just disappeared.

16:02.503 --> 16:06.173
-So they could still be alive.
-No one knows.

16:06.256 --> 16:11.178
But, Dad, listen to me.
You need to stop broadcasting from Earth.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.763
Members of the Blade of Marmora

16:12.846 --> 16:15.724
and the Voltron Coalition
are being hunted.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.602
Our army has been all but wiped out.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.354
The situation is bad out here,

16:20.437 --> 16:24.149
and the last thing we need
is to put Earth in danger.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.694
But how will I get ahold of you?

16:27.027 --> 16:30.030
I have to go.
I'll contact you when I'm safe.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.241
I love you both.

16:37.705 --> 16:41.166
It's time. We need to tell
the rest of the world the situation.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.502
Sam, I'm sorry to hear
about your daughter,

16:43.585 --> 16:45.004
but we can't get off course.

16:45.087 --> 16:49.591
If we wanna finish the IGF-ATLAS,
we need more resources and more manpower.

16:49.925 --> 16:53.178
The world needs to come together so that
we can take the fight to the Galra.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.348
You're too emotional right now
and you're not thinking straight.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.518
We're not building ships
to go fight aliens in different galaxies.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.353
But they need us.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.689
The citizens of Earth need us.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.400
And yet you refuse to tell them the truth!

17:06.483 --> 17:08.736
Maybe we should talk about this later.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.530
We can talk later,
but my decision will be the same.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.073
We're not telling the people of Earth

17:13.156 --> 17:15.867
and we're not fighting
in someone else's war.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.748
They're gonna be okay.

17:21.290 --> 17:25.044
They will be okay because they're strong
just like their mother.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.755
We've gotta do something.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.008
We can't just sit here
while our children are in danger.

17:31.341 --> 17:34.928
We're doing everything we can
with the limited personnel we have.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.765
Then we'll get more personnel
and more resources.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.225
The admiral is making decisions
for the rest of the world.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.020
I say let them make decisions
for themselves.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.938
You wanna tell the world?

17:45.439 --> 17:49.193
The repercussions could be serious.
They could kick us out of the Garrison.

17:49.651 --> 17:52.738
It's risky, but that ship
may never get done otherwise.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.991
And I'll do whatever it takes
to see my kids again.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.577
Okay.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.668
-You're sure you wanna do this?
-I'm sure.

18:13.050 --> 18:17.137
All right, I'll be broadcasting
on every channel. You ready?

18:23.519 --> 18:26.688
Citizens of Earth.
My name is Colleen Holt.

18:26.772 --> 18:31.110
I am the wife of famed astronaut,
Sam Holt, and mother of Matt Holt.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.487
Two years ago,
it was believed that they died

18:33.570 --> 18:35.114
during a deep space mission.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.407
That was a lie.

18:37.574 --> 18:40.661
My husband, along with his crew,
were abducted by an alien race

18:40.744 --> 18:41.912
known as the Galra,

18:42.162 --> 18:44.998
a fact that was covered up
by the Galaxy Garrison.

18:45.874 --> 18:49.169
Admiral, you need to see this.
They're broadcasting on every channel.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.172
A year ago, my husband returned to Earth,

18:52.256 --> 18:55.217
but the Garrison forced him
to stay in hiding.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.720
I'm afraid we can't allow Sam
to leave the premises.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.180
We're not prepared to tell the world

19:00.264 --> 19:03.433
about the existence
of alien life just yet.

19:03.517 --> 19:08.355
But I refuse to stay hidden any longer.
We desperately need your help.

19:08.856 --> 19:13.318
Not every alien species is friendly,
and Planet Earth must be protected.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.237
Here at the Garrison,

19:15.404 --> 19:18.365
we've been working on creating
advanced ships and weaponry.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.992
Get the rest of the guards.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.828
The footage you are about to see is real.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.664
These are the Galra.

19:25.747 --> 19:30.502
If they find Earth, they will attack,
and we must be prepared.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.131
Huh. Guess the cat's out of the bag, huh?

19:34.339 --> 19:37.176
But there are those
that have spent years protecting us.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.971
They are the Paladins of Voltron,
and they come from Earth.

19:42.222 --> 19:45.475
I can't wait to be back home.
I'm not really sure when that'll be,

19:45.559 --> 19:47.394
but when I get there,
I really want Uncle Filo

19:47.477 --> 19:49.730
to make some of his amazing pork lau lau.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.064
I can almost taste it now.

19:53.066 --> 19:58.155
Hi, Mom, hi, Dad. It's me, Lance.
I'm here in outer space somewhere.

19:58.238 --> 20:02.576
I, um, uh, don't really know what to say.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.414
I miss you guys. I miss you guys a lot.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.418
Mom, I'm so sorry I left
without saying goodbye.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.420
I think of you every day.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.924
Now is the time to come together.

20:17.007 --> 20:21.094
To protect our world,
we must be united under one cause.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.516
Override the lock.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.274
Lock them up.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.237
-For what?
-For divulging top secret information.

20:38.528 --> 20:41.114
Now, now, Admiral. Don't get emotional.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.700
You disregarded a direct order.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.787
You held me at the Garrison
against my will.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.288
You lied about my death.

20:48.372 --> 20:52.668
You wanna control every situation.
But face it, you can't.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.253
The world needed to know this,

20:54.336 --> 20:56.630
and now that they do,
it will be better for us.

20:56.922 --> 21:00.801
Right now, the world needs a leader
that's not afraid to face facts

21:00.884 --> 21:02.135
and you're not it.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.221
And you think you are?

21:05.013 --> 21:06.223
Yes.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.059
Get these traitors out of here.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.603
Stop.

21:12.479 --> 21:15.232
If Sam goes, I go too.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.861
Admiral Sanda, calls are coming in
from all over the world.

21:20.153 --> 21:23.532
Citizens want to know how they can help.
It's incredible.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.951
It worked.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.848
-That's the last one.
-Think it'll work?

21:47.931 --> 21:50.142
Well, particle barriers are tricky,

21:50.225 --> 21:54.062
but if my calculations are right,
these just might act as a perimeter.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.274
What's that?

21:58.317 --> 22:01.737
I don't know. I didn't think
we were doing any test flights today.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.117
They're here.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.540
Activate the particle barrier immediately.

22:13.623 --> 22:15.375
Are you sure, sir?
We haven't run diagnostics--

22:15.459 --> 22:16.626
Do it, now!
