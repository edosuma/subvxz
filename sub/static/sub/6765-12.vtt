WEBVTT

00:02.471 --> 00:04.905
The French Revolution
is synonymous

00:04.939 --> 00:06.271
with chaos in government.

00:06.308 --> 00:09.106
Rebel women knitted while
watching the heads

00:09.144 --> 00:11.442
of the old guard plop
into the baskets

00:11.480 --> 00:14.176
that were placed at the foot
of Monsieur Guillotine.

00:15.951 --> 00:17.441
An atmosphere
of absurdity reigned.

00:17.486 --> 00:19.113
One...

00:22.591 --> 00:23.785
Brandon?

00:23.826 --> 00:25.293
Not me, Mom.

00:27.696 --> 00:31.223
I was a butcher
cutting up meat

00:31.266 --> 00:33.461
-My hands were bloody
-Rolling Stones, Dad?

00:33.502 --> 00:35.732
-I'm dying on my feet...
-What has gotten into you?

00:35.771 --> 00:37.466
l gotta tell you,
they still do it to me.

00:37.506 --> 00:40.031
What's in the sack, Jack?

00:40.142 --> 00:42.804
Just a little show of gratitude
from a satisfied client.

00:42.845 --> 00:45.211
He's a merchandising honcho
with the Voodoo Lounge tour.

00:45.247 --> 00:46.305
Grab what you
want, chief.

00:46.348 --> 00:47.645
Give the rest
to your friends.

00:47.683 --> 00:49.844
Somehow, l can't see
Kelly wearing that.

00:49.885 --> 00:51.147
Give her
a CD, then.

00:51.186 --> 00:52.312
Take what you want,

00:52.354 --> 00:54.288
but leave the Let it Bleed album
for me.

00:55.324 --> 00:56.723
And my chick.

00:56.758 --> 00:58.658
Oh, you're bad.

00:58.694 --> 01:00.252
Dad, uh, this stuff's great
and everything,

01:00.295 --> 01:02.092
but, uh, how about some tickets?

01:02.131 --> 01:03.598
They're playing at
the Rose Bowl.

01:03.632 --> 01:05.998
Well, truthfully,
l'd rather listen to them

01:06.101 --> 01:07.625
in the privacy of my home.

01:07.669 --> 01:09.534
l'm not talking
about you, Dad.

01:09.571 --> 01:11.903
Oh, you want to
go to the concert.

01:11.940 --> 01:13.805
l thought you were
worried about midterms.

01:13.842 --> 01:16.310
Well, l'm worried about
a lot of things, Dad,

01:16.345 --> 01:18.006
but a couple tickets
to the Rolling Stones

01:18.080 --> 01:20.514
may alleviate some of my pain
if you know what l'm saying?

01:20.549 --> 01:23.347
Yeah, well, l'll see
what l can do.

01:23.385 --> 01:24.716
But they might be sold out.

01:24.753 --> 01:26.186
Really?

01:26.221 --> 01:28.416
l can't believe that after
all these years

01:28.457 --> 01:30.391
people are still excited
about the Rolling Stones.

01:30.425 --> 01:32.256
You got me running

01:32.294 --> 01:36.424
I was a butcher
cutting up meat

01:36.465 --> 01:37.727
My hands are bloody

01:37.766 --> 01:39.700
I'm dying on my feet

01:39.735 --> 01:44.001
Feeling bad,
i guess i lost my spring

01:44.039 --> 01:47.338
i was a boxer who can't
get in the ring

01:47.376 --> 01:51.039
Hey, hey, you got me rocking

01:51.113 --> 01:55.049
Hey, hey, there ain't
no stopping me

01:55.083 --> 01:56.573
Hey, hey...

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:50.098 --> 03:51.963
Hi, Kel.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.560
Hi.

03:54.603 --> 03:56.764
Hey, l know that girl!

03:56.805 --> 03:59.137
No, don't look at them.
l just spent the last hour

03:59.174 --> 04:01.142
going over every
little imperfection.

04:01.176 --> 04:02.643
What're you talking about?
You look great.

04:02.678 --> 04:04.976
That's what everyone
at the magazine says.

04:05.013 --> 04:06.605
Maybe that's why
l'm so nervous.

04:06.648 --> 04:07.774
What's in the bag?

04:07.816 --> 04:10.944
Rolling Stones T-shirts.
One for you if you'd like.

04:10.986 --> 04:12.977
No. l'm still trying
to adjust to the fact

04:13.088 --> 04:15.079
that l've got to go
to their show tonight.

04:15.123 --> 04:17.317
You're going to the concert?

04:17.358 --> 04:19.793
Yeah, the magazine editor
wants me to go hang out

04:19.827 --> 04:22.422
in the VlP lounge, have a
photo-op with a Stone or two.

04:22.464 --> 04:23.829
And you're not excited?

04:23.865 --> 04:26.459
Brandon, l would be,
but l've got a midterm

04:26.501 --> 04:27.593
in Abnormal
Psychology tomorrow.

04:27.636 --> 04:29.433
Well, if you would like me
to go in your place,

04:29.471 --> 04:31.132
all you have to do
is say the word.

04:31.173 --> 04:34.301
l would, thanks,
but l just don't think

04:34.343 --> 04:37.471
that they'd consider you for the
cover of the swimsuit edition.

04:37.512 --> 04:40.413
That's only because they've
never seen me in a thong.

04:40.449 --> 04:41.746
So, you really want to go?

04:41.783 --> 04:43.114
Absolutely,

04:43.151 --> 04:45.779
it would help take my mind off
this whole CRB thing.

04:45.821 --> 04:46.788
What's a CRB?

04:46.822 --> 04:48.153
The Constitutional Review Board.

04:48.190 --> 04:50.158
l just got word they're gonna
meet on Friday night

04:50.192 --> 04:52.558
to decide whether or not l have
the right to be president.

04:52.594 --> 04:54.585
l wish you didn't have
to go through this.

04:54.629 --> 04:55.994
lt had to happen sometime.

04:56.031 --> 04:57.123
l don't get it.

04:57.165 --> 04:58.689
Why does Alex Diaz have
it in for you?

04:58.734 --> 05:03.103
Because l'm the president
and he's not.

05:03.138 --> 05:07.097
Hmm. So going to the Stones'
concert would be the only thing

05:07.142 --> 05:08.803
that would get your
mind off of him?

05:08.844 --> 05:12.109
Well, l can think
of a few other things.

05:12.147 --> 05:13.774
Like what?

05:13.815 --> 05:14.975
Well...

05:15.083 --> 05:16.209
Mmm, that?

05:16.251 --> 05:18.549
All right, stand by.

05:20.122 --> 05:22.989
This is C.U. Later Entertainment
News, take one.

05:24.192 --> 05:26.217
Wow, l'm excited, David.

05:26.261 --> 05:28.991
ln the concert spotlight tonight
is the Rolling Stones'

05:29.030 --> 05:30.827
big Voodoo Lounge show
at the Rose Bowl.

05:30.866 --> 05:33.096
That's right, Clare.
lt's sold out, so even

05:33.135 --> 05:35.763
if you wanted to get tickets
for tonight, you couldn't.

05:35.804 --> 05:38.705
Yeah, like l'd really want to
watch an irrelevant band of...

05:38.740 --> 05:39.900
Dinosaurs?
Yeah.

05:39.941 --> 05:41.135
Yeah.

05:43.612 --> 05:45.443
Guys, can you read
the copy that's given?

05:45.480 --> 05:48.176
This is news,
not commentary.

05:48.216 --> 05:50.446
Sure. Sorry, look, just give
us a second, all right?

05:50.485 --> 05:52.476
We have a couple
rewrites we're gonna do.

05:52.521 --> 05:53.579
Great.

05:57.359 --> 05:58.519
Bored yet?

05:58.560 --> 06:00.221
No. But they are so wrong.

06:00.262 --> 06:01.661
About what?

06:01.696 --> 06:05.359
The Stones.
l mean, they are rock and roll.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.732
You've got to give
the masters some respect.

06:07.769 --> 06:11.136
Well, l don't know their
stuff that well.

06:11.173 --> 06:12.663
Believe me, l do.

06:12.707 --> 06:15.733
My mother took me to my first
concert when l was six.

06:15.777 --> 06:17.972
l've caught every one
of their tours since.

06:18.013 --> 06:21.744
And ''Wild Horses'' was probably
the first song l ever sang.

06:21.783 --> 06:23.250
lt's a beautiful ballad.

06:23.285 --> 06:24.980
l'd like to hear you do it.

06:25.086 --> 06:27.077
l got a better idea.

06:27.122 --> 06:29.283
You should hear
Mick do it, live.

06:29.324 --> 06:32.919
What? What's going on?

06:32.961 --> 06:35.191
l think you're looking at
the guy who's going to take you

06:35.230 --> 06:36.595
to your first
Rolling Stones concert.

06:39.234 --> 06:40.963
Kelly, have you seen Brandon?

06:41.002 --> 06:42.663
Yeah, he should be
here in a minute.

06:42.704 --> 06:43.671
Good.

06:43.705 --> 06:45.104
-Come, sit down.
-Thanks.

06:46.675 --> 06:47.869
You should see
these proofs.

06:47.909 --> 06:49.001
They're beautiful.

06:49.110 --> 06:51.010
Can we please talk about
something other than me?

06:51.079 --> 06:52.011
How are your midterms going?

06:52.113 --> 06:53.740
Ask me at the end
of the week.

06:53.782 --> 06:55.147
Yeah, me, too.

06:55.183 --> 06:57.344
l've got a Genetics professor
who likes to test you

06:57.385 --> 06:58.477
on stuff you haven't studied.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.112
Yeah, l think Brandon
will be relieved

07:00.155 --> 07:01.918
when his World History is over.

07:01.957 --> 07:03.948
Brandon will be relieved
when he finds out that

07:04.025 --> 07:06.255
Jim got two free tickets
to the Rolling Stones.

07:06.294 --> 07:08.319
He'll be stoked.

07:08.363 --> 07:09.352
Stoked about what?

07:12.434 --> 07:14.265
Are those for tonight's
concert, Mom?

07:14.302 --> 07:16.634
Oh, you mean these
two VlP,

07:16.671 --> 07:18.400
first-row, to die for

07:18.440 --> 07:21.273
tickets and all-access passes?

07:23.078 --> 07:24.477
Life is good.

07:24.513 --> 07:25.775
Oh, and if
you don't need

07:25.814 --> 07:27.475
the extra ticket,
Valerie would love to go.

07:27.516 --> 07:28.483
Gotcha.

07:28.517 --> 07:29.882
l heard the CRB is going

07:29.918 --> 07:30.976
to rule on your
Presidency this Friday.

07:31.086 --> 07:32.713
No, that's just a nasty rumor.

07:32.754 --> 07:33.880
Well, if you need

07:33.922 --> 07:35.583
any legal advice, Jesse
would be glad to help.

07:35.624 --> 07:36.613
Thanks.

07:36.658 --> 07:38.125
But actually, l'm hoping they're
gonna postpone

07:38.159 --> 07:40.093
the whole thing till the
Chancellor gets back in town.

07:40.128 --> 07:41.186
Sit down.

07:41.229 --> 07:42.355
Nope, no can do.

07:42.397 --> 07:43.989
Got too much work
to do at the library.

07:44.099 --> 07:45.361
Meet me at the
Pit, though.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.458
We'll go to the
concert together.

07:46.501 --> 07:48.196
-That's the plan.
-Okay. Thanks, Mom.

07:48.937 --> 07:50.461
Bye.

07:50.505 --> 07:53.872
Does Brandon realize he could
be impeached this Friday?

07:53.909 --> 07:56.776
l think he's in denial.

08:07.556 --> 08:09.319
Good afternoon, Alex.

08:09.357 --> 08:12.656
Getting all geared up for the
battle royal Friday night?

08:12.694 --> 08:15.629
You obviously haven't
checked your messages.

08:15.664 --> 08:18.633
So, do l have
to check the machine,

08:18.667 --> 08:20.658
or are you going
to save me the suspense?

08:22.604 --> 08:27.132
The Constitutional Review Board
convenes at 6:00 tonight.

08:27.175 --> 08:29.200
Tonight?

08:29.244 --> 08:30.370
Check the machine.

08:30.412 --> 08:32.471
lt'll be the same
message l got.

08:32.514 --> 08:34.982
lt's a three-judge panel.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.347
That's three schedules
to juggle.

08:37.385 --> 08:39.852
Apparently this head man,
Dershenbaum,

08:39.888 --> 08:43.517
is due in federal
court on Friday.

08:43.558 --> 08:44.855
So we were moved up.

08:44.893 --> 08:47.828
And you're thinking between
the two of us,

08:47.862 --> 08:49.796
we can get it postponed?

08:49.831 --> 08:51.355
No.

08:51.399 --> 08:54.425
l'm here to tell you that
you are going to lose.

08:56.071 --> 08:59.199
But if you still
want a political career

08:59.240 --> 09:02.869
on this campus,
resign as president now.

09:02.911 --> 09:04.879
Before the hearing?

09:04.913 --> 09:05.937
That's right.

09:05.981 --> 09:07.676
lt's a show of good faith.

09:07.716 --> 09:09.741
And then come next
general election,

09:09.784 --> 09:12.844
we'll back you
in any other office.

09:15.090 --> 09:18.116
You know, l do have
front-row tickets

09:18.159 --> 09:19.387
to the Rolling Stones tonight.

09:19.427 --> 09:20.485
Great.

09:20.528 --> 09:22.996
Enjoy the show.

09:25.033 --> 09:29.333
You know, Alex,
l just can't do it.

09:31.206 --> 09:32.867
l'll see you in court.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.846
Thanks for stopping by.

09:54.362 --> 09:56.728
Look, l'm sorry
if l haven't been much of

09:56.765 --> 09:59.461
a conversationalist
these last few days.

09:59.501 --> 10:02.493
Well, l hate to break it,
but, uh, you never were.

10:04.406 --> 10:05.839
You want some gum?

10:05.874 --> 10:08.308
No, thanks.

10:08.343 --> 10:11.540
Lollipops, toothpicks,
breath mints?

10:11.579 --> 10:13.877
What'd you do, win the door
prize at the mini-mart?

10:13.915 --> 10:19.478
No, l'm, uh... just
detoxing like you.

10:19.521 --> 10:24.458
l've sworn off of cigarettes,
liquor, pot, everything.

10:24.492 --> 10:26.585
Even sex?

10:26.628 --> 10:30.257
Well, this week anyway.

10:30.298 --> 10:33.392
So l guess we do
have to talk.

10:33.435 --> 10:35.335
Oh, before l forget, um...

10:35.370 --> 10:38.567
Brandon wanted me to give you
this hat and T-shirt.

10:38.606 --> 10:41.507
Oh, the Rolling Stones!

10:41.543 --> 10:43.773
He said if you didn't want
it, he'd understand.

10:43.812 --> 10:44.972
Are you kidding?

10:45.013 --> 10:46.378
l want it.

10:50.852 --> 10:54.049
So, um, how
you feeling?

10:54.122 --> 10:57.853
l'm just, you know, settling in
for the long haul.

10:59.928 --> 11:01.759
Well, you'll make it.

11:01.796 --> 11:03.195
l better make it.

11:07.368 --> 11:09.131
Look, there's a
couple little things

11:09.170 --> 11:10.467
that l think
you should know.

11:10.505 --> 11:11.972
Like what?

11:12.006 --> 11:16.466
Like, um...

11:16.511 --> 11:19.571
no one knows that
l was with you the night

11:19.614 --> 11:20.842
that you almost killed yourself,

11:20.882 --> 11:23.942
and if we could keep
it that way...

11:23.985 --> 11:26.317
Yeah, we can keep it that way.

11:26.354 --> 11:28.015
What else?

11:28.056 --> 11:33.221
Well, when your mom asked me
to go back to the house,

11:33.261 --> 11:37.721
to get you some clothes,
l found your stash.

11:39.801 --> 11:41.291
Did you enjoy it?

11:43.071 --> 11:44.834
l flushed it down the toilet.

11:46.174 --> 11:48.665
Afraid l'd start
using it again?

11:48.710 --> 11:50.371
No.

11:50.411 --> 11:52.311
ln case the police got a warrant

11:52.347 --> 11:54.042
and searched your house
while you were here.

11:55.884 --> 11:58.352
Listen to what you just said.

12:00.321 --> 12:02.789
l can't be dragging you
into stuff like this.

12:02.824 --> 12:03.984
-Val, l mean...
-Dylan...

12:04.092 --> 12:06.322
No, hear me out.

12:10.131 --> 12:13.123
We had some good times.
l gotta do this by myself.

12:13.168 --> 12:16.194
lt's the only way
it's gonna work.

12:16.237 --> 12:18.967
You gotta get on
with your life...

12:19.007 --> 12:20.599
without me in it.

12:24.145 --> 12:26.477
Yeah, l...

12:26.514 --> 12:29.005
l guess that's why
l'm here, too.

12:30.985 --> 12:33.749
To say good-bye.

12:44.899 --> 12:45.991
So long.

12:46.034 --> 12:47.501
Bye.

13:20.969 --> 13:22.732
Look at this line.

13:22.770 --> 13:24.260
You think we got
here early enough?

13:24.305 --> 13:25.465
We're right on time.

13:25.506 --> 13:27.474
We probably should have brought
some seats or something.

13:27.508 --> 13:29.874
l mean, they're probably not
gonna let people in for hours.

13:29.911 --> 13:31.003
We're not waiting in line.

13:31.112 --> 13:32.511
What?

13:32.547 --> 13:34.208
Ray, do you have
tickets or don't you?

13:34.249 --> 13:35.716
The show's sold out.

13:35.750 --> 13:36.808
l don't have tickets.

13:36.851 --> 13:38.648
Oh, great.

13:38.686 --> 13:41.348
Relax. l've seen all the
great shows without tickets.

13:41.389 --> 13:43.584
l've seen Springsteen,
Nirvana, even the Eagles.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.025
l never miss a note.
We can go right in.

13:46.060 --> 13:47.027
Hold on.

13:47.061 --> 13:48.426
l'm not doing anything illegal.

13:48.463 --> 13:49.896
Who said anything about that?

13:51.733 --> 13:52.700
Here you go.

13:52.734 --> 13:54.167
What's this?

13:54.202 --> 13:55.362
A vendor's badge.

13:55.403 --> 13:58.031
Vendor? We're working here?

13:58.072 --> 14:01.098
Of course. lt's
the only way to see the show.

14:05.146 --> 14:07.046
Yeah, all right,
that's good.

14:12.987 --> 14:16.616
Okay, l'm online
with Delphi.

14:16.658 --> 14:18.091
All right, type in
''Go Ent Rock''.

14:18.126 --> 14:19.855
There's a whole
Rolling Stones section.

14:19.894 --> 14:21.361
Okay, one sec,
let's just check out

14:21.396 --> 14:22.658
this live chat
conference first,

14:22.697 --> 14:24.995
see what these cretin
fans are saying.

14:25.033 --> 14:27.001
''The San Diego show
was awesome.

14:27.035 --> 14:28.161
''Mick was shaman-like.

14:28.202 --> 14:31.137
''Keith was killer.
The Stones rule-- Kenny''.

14:32.173 --> 14:34.232
Clare, what are you doing?

14:34.275 --> 14:35.606
Chatting back.

14:35.643 --> 14:36.837
''Kenny,

14:36.878 --> 14:40.177
''obviously, anyone who uses
as many cliches as you do

14:40.214 --> 14:42.580
''probably wouldn't know
good music if it was injected

14:42.617 --> 14:46.576
''into his... ear.

14:46.621 --> 14:47.679
Clare.''

14:47.722 --> 14:49.212
Clare, these people
are gonna jump

14:49.257 --> 14:51.225
down your throat--
you're gonna get flamed.

14:51.259 --> 14:52.624
Exactly.

14:52.660 --> 14:54.890
Oh, here come the
angry responses now.

14:54.929 --> 14:58.228
''Yo, Mick/Keith faithful,
don't pay any attention

14:58.266 --> 15:00.131
to this Clare-a-Belle...''

15:00.168 --> 15:01.795
Clare-a-Belle?

15:01.836 --> 15:04.202
''She's obviously an experiment
in artificial stupidity.''

15:04.238 --> 15:06.138
Wait, hold on a second,
let me give it a shot.

15:06.174 --> 15:08.734
Okay.
''Hey, buds, l was
offered tickets

15:08.776 --> 15:11.973
''to the LA show,
but l'd rather stay home

15:12.080 --> 15:14.310
and format my floppies.''

15:14.349 --> 15:15.907
Nice blast.

15:15.950 --> 15:19.249
You didn't really get
offered tickets, right?

15:19.287 --> 15:21.448
Well, yeah, my dad left
a message on the machine.

15:21.489 --> 15:22.979
l gotta call him back
and tell him no.

15:23.024 --> 15:25.219
No! Don't... don't...
don't do that.

15:25.259 --> 15:26.317
Let's go.

15:26.361 --> 15:28.261
What, are you serious?

15:28.296 --> 15:29.991
Yeah, come on, don't
you want to see

15:30.064 --> 15:32.692
these rabid fans up
close and personal?

15:32.734 --> 15:34.292
lt'll be a panic.

15:34.335 --> 15:37.429
Okay...

15:37.472 --> 15:39.303
''Thanks for all your
kind thoughts,

15:39.340 --> 15:42.434
''but anyone who thinks
the Stones rule

15:42.477 --> 15:44.604
''probably got into
the gene pool

15:44.645 --> 15:47.011
while the lifeguard
wasn't watching''.

15:48.716 --> 15:50.308
So, we'll go pick up the
programs and souvenirs

15:50.351 --> 15:51.875
right before they
let the crowd in.

15:51.919 --> 15:53.181
Then we'll go meet
my cousin, Conway,

15:53.221 --> 15:54.745
and he'll assign
us as floaters.

15:54.789 --> 15:56.222
We can go anywhere
and see it all

15:56.257 --> 15:57.724
while we work--
you're gonna love it.

15:57.759 --> 15:59.488
Well, luckily l got
some experience

15:59.527 --> 16:01.461
at the pumpkin patch
making change.

16:01.496 --> 16:03.964
Yeah, l got you on
the fast track now.

16:03.998 --> 16:05.397
Come on, l'm gonna
show you something

16:05.433 --> 16:07.162
you're never
gonna forget.

16:19.313 --> 16:20.974
Oh, my God.

16:21.082 --> 16:24.176
This is what it's like
to be a rock star.

16:24.218 --> 16:26.186
l bet even Mick Jagger
gets butterflies

16:26.220 --> 16:27.312
before the show starts.

16:27.355 --> 16:28.344
Everybody does.

16:28.389 --> 16:29.947
How many people
do you think

16:29.991 --> 16:31.686
are gonna be
here tonight?

16:31.726 --> 16:34.718
Oh, 70,000, give or take
a vendor or two.

16:34.762 --> 16:36.923
lmagine what it feels like
to perform up here.

16:36.964 --> 16:39.797
You know,
this could be you someday.

16:41.302 --> 16:44.465
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome if you will...

16:44.505 --> 16:46.973
Ray Pruit!

16:47.008 --> 16:48.407
Thank you, thank you.

16:48.443 --> 16:50.411
l'd like to dedicate
this first song

16:50.445 --> 16:52.606
to the best thing that
ever happened to me.

17:06.961 --> 17:10.521
l don't wanna see you

17:10.565 --> 17:14.330
Ever sad

17:14.367 --> 17:18.667
Everything that l've got

17:18.705 --> 17:21.641
You can have

17:21.675 --> 17:24.804
When it's all too much

17:26.079 --> 17:29.311
You need some human touch

17:29.350 --> 17:35.186
To see it's really not so bad

17:37.225 --> 17:38.988
Hey, man, what
are you doing?

17:39.060 --> 17:40.152
Get outta here!

17:40.194 --> 17:42.355
Uh, sorry, man,
no harm done.

17:45.166 --> 17:46.656
Show's over.

17:46.701 --> 17:48.328
This is so cool!

17:52.106 --> 17:53.971
Just send over
what you want me to sign

17:54.008 --> 17:54.997
and l'll sign it.

17:55.042 --> 17:56.009
Oh, come on.

17:56.043 --> 17:57.203
Don't take that attitude.

17:57.245 --> 17:58.303
Hey, Steve,

17:58.346 --> 17:59.506
it's not an attitude,
all right?

17:59.547 --> 18:01.071
lt's where l'm at
with it right now.

18:01.115 --> 18:02.082
Let's just move on.

18:02.116 --> 18:03.947
Well, everything considered,

18:04.018 --> 18:06.384
investing probably
isn't something

18:06.420 --> 18:08.650
you need to be doing
now anyway, right?

18:08.689 --> 18:10.122
Definitely not.

18:10.158 --> 18:12.149
Hmm, so, uh,

18:12.193 --> 18:13.626
what's this place really like?

18:15.062 --> 18:17.656
You know, the first few days,
it's called ''the honeymoon.''

18:17.698 --> 18:18.892
How bad could it be?

18:18.933 --> 18:21.094
When's the honeymoon over?

18:21.135 --> 18:23.933
Tonight, when l meet
my therapy group.

18:23.971 --> 18:25.199
Group therapy...

18:25.239 --> 18:26.968
You've been down
that road with A.A.

18:27.041 --> 18:29.373
Yeah, but this place
is nothing like A.A.

18:29.410 --> 18:32.243
l mean, it's like a throwback
to the '60s, you know,

18:32.280 --> 18:33.872
the kind of therapy
they had back then.

18:33.915 --> 18:37.578
Uh, confrontational analysis.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.950
Well, go slow.

18:39.987 --> 18:43.184
Just kinda ease
in, okay?

18:43.224 --> 18:45.055
Yeah, that's what
l'm trying to do.

18:46.928 --> 18:49.362
Oh, chow time.
Believe me, you don't want to

18:49.397 --> 18:51.422
be here for this.
Come on, l'll walk you out.

18:54.101 --> 18:55.363
What's the matter
with you, Willie?

18:55.403 --> 18:56.836
You come all the way
out here, brother,

18:56.871 --> 18:58.498
you ain't got nothing
to say to me?

18:58.539 --> 19:00.439
l didn't know
what to say.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.442
Well, l've known you
a long time.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.909
Just tell me what's
on your mind.

19:03.945 --> 19:05.913
l feel bad for you, Dylan.

19:05.947 --> 19:07.710
You just keep messing up.

19:07.748 --> 19:11.206
Yeah, well, who asked you?

19:11.252 --> 19:14.187
Subtle.

19:16.557 --> 19:19.822
I know
it's only rock 'n'roll

19:19.860 --> 19:22.192
But i like it

19:24.065 --> 19:27.557
I know
it's only rock 'n'roll

19:27.602 --> 19:30.867
But i like it, like it,
yes, i do

19:30.905 --> 19:32.497
Well, i like it

19:32.540 --> 19:33.507
Jim...

19:33.541 --> 19:35.099
Honey, l'm making dinner.

19:35.142 --> 19:37.542
Yeah, but l want some
hors d'oeuvres.

19:37.578 --> 19:39.773
Ooh, you're so bad.

19:39.814 --> 19:40.974
I like it

19:41.015 --> 19:41.982
Hmm...

19:42.016 --> 19:44.746
I said can't you see

19:44.785 --> 19:47.845
That this old boy's
been lonely

19:50.391 --> 19:52.325
if i could stick a knife...

19:52.360 --> 19:54.294
Valerie!

19:54.328 --> 19:56.819
l thought you were going
to the Stones concert.

19:56.864 --> 20:00.459
l decided
l was gonna study instead.

20:00.501 --> 20:02.833
Oh, no problem.

20:04.372 --> 20:06.840
Well, uh, l'll be upstairs.

20:06.874 --> 20:07.966
Pretend l'm
not here.

20:09.543 --> 20:10.669
Bye.

20:10.711 --> 20:13.043
Feelings would flood
on the page

20:14.715 --> 20:16.342
Would it satisfy ya?

20:16.384 --> 20:18.352
You all ready, counselor?

20:18.386 --> 20:20.877
Well, l could've used
a little more time,

20:20.921 --> 20:23.219
but uh, we'll stay
on our toes, eh?

20:23.257 --> 20:24.747
Anything l should
watch out for?

20:24.792 --> 20:26.760
Well, from what l've seen
of three-judge panels,

20:26.794 --> 20:28.785
it's politics and personality
that tip the balance.

20:28.829 --> 20:31.457
You're gonna need two out of
three to back you in there...

20:31.499 --> 20:33.763
meaning, we're gonna have to win
a few friends, all right?

20:33.801 --> 20:34.768
All right.

20:34.802 --> 20:35.962
Hi, Brandon.

20:36.003 --> 20:37.402
Hi, Janice, are you
and Alex ready

20:37.438 --> 20:39.167
for your coup d'etat?
Look...

20:39.206 --> 20:41.674
Politically, we may be
in opposite camps,

20:41.709 --> 20:43.040
but you know
how much l admired

20:43.144 --> 20:44.736
the way you handled yourself
with Roland Turner.

20:44.779 --> 20:46.508
Well, l don't want
to seem ungrateful,

20:46.547 --> 20:48.538
but this sure is a funny
way of showing it.

20:48.582 --> 20:50.311
lt's nothing personal, Brandon.

20:50.351 --> 20:52.979
Yeah, it never is.

20:53.020 --> 20:54.647
Yeah.

20:58.225 --> 21:00.716
Very PC of you, Walsh,
a representative of color.

21:00.761 --> 21:03.628
You're kidding,
and l thought

21:03.664 --> 21:07.156
l just hired the best
available attorney-- ha!

21:09.470 --> 21:11.097
ls Janice Williams
still with Diaz?

21:11.138 --> 21:12.537
Yeah, but she
wished me luck.

21:12.573 --> 21:13.562
Wasn't that
big of her?

21:13.607 --> 21:15.006
Look at this.

21:15.042 --> 21:16.134
l can't believe this,

21:16.177 --> 21:17.201
somebody ordered
take-out here.

21:17.244 --> 21:20.577
Oh, that's mine,
over here.

21:20.614 --> 21:22.013
Who's the hungry man?

21:22.049 --> 21:23.016
That's Aaron Dershenbaum.

21:23.050 --> 21:24.142
He's the head jurist,

21:24.185 --> 21:25.584
teaches Constitutional
Law here.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.416
From what l can pick
up, prides himself

21:27.455 --> 21:29.150
on defending
the protected classes.

21:30.391 --> 21:32.222
What was that you were saying
about politics?

21:32.259 --> 21:34.193
-What about the other two?
-That's Marcia Ramsden,

21:34.228 --> 21:36.560
up-and-coming feminist
lawyer, specializing

21:36.597 --> 21:38.394
in sexual
discrimination suits.

21:38.432 --> 21:39.558
Great.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.865
Okay, so it's not exactly
the panel we hoped for.

21:42.903 --> 21:46.236
And to think l could be
in Steve's limo right now

21:46.273 --> 21:48.901
arriving at the Rolling
Stones concert.

21:50.878 --> 21:52.607
Welcome to the Rose Bowl

21:52.646 --> 21:54.045

Rolling Stones concert.

Rolling Stones concert.

22:22.343 --> 22:24.470

22:24.512 --> 22:26.139
No, no, no,
lose the book.

22:26.180 --> 22:27.272
You're embarrassing me.

22:27.314 --> 22:28.303
-Come on.
-What're you talking about?

22:28.349 --> 22:29.714
There's a lot of dead
time at concerts.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.650
l'm gonna make the most of it.

22:32.420 --> 22:33.682
Kelly!

22:34.789 --> 22:35.756
Hi.

22:35.790 --> 22:37.155
Hey, l didn't know
you guys were coming.

22:37.191 --> 22:38.749
-Hey! -Well, David's
father invited us.

22:38.793 --> 22:40.556
So we thought we'd come
down and check out

22:40.594 --> 22:42.459
what this Stones hype
was all about.

22:42.496 --> 22:43.986
l thought we were here
to bag on everything.

22:44.031 --> 22:44.998
Well, that, too.

22:45.032 --> 22:46.829
Where is Mel?
l'd love to say hello.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.494
We were supposed to meet
him at the main gate,

22:48.536 --> 22:50.163
but l guess he's running a
little late, so we're

22:50.204 --> 22:51.933
gonna go over to will-call
then swing back through.

22:51.972 --> 22:54.236
Same ol' Mel.
Happy hunting.

22:54.275 --> 22:55.242
See you guys inside.

22:55.276 --> 22:57.005
Only if you can get backstage.

22:59.513 --> 23:01.811
David, l get the impression
from what Kelly said,

23:01.849 --> 23:03.817
your father may not be
the most dependable person

23:03.851 --> 23:04.977
on the planet-- yes, no?

23:05.019 --> 23:06.646
No, don't listen
to Kelly, all right?

23:06.687 --> 23:09.383
He'll be here, eventually.

23:09.423 --> 23:10.447
Have a good time.

23:10.491 --> 23:12.550
Steve Sanders.

23:12.593 --> 23:13.821
Hey, l see my photographer.

23:13.861 --> 23:15.089
l'll see you in there.
Okay.

23:15.129 --> 23:16.221
How do you spell that?

23:16.263 --> 23:19.596
Sanders, S-A-N-D-E-R-S.

23:19.633 --> 23:21.999
l was comped
by the band.

23:22.036 --> 23:23.230
Could it be
under another name?

23:23.270 --> 23:25.397
Uh, actually, yes it could.

23:25.439 --> 23:26.667
Try Claudette Wells.

23:26.707 --> 23:28.766
l'm actually her guest.

23:28.809 --> 23:30.936
Ms. Wells didn't
leave you a ticket.

23:30.978 --> 23:32.843
She's expecting me backstage.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.541
Yeah, try the Special Ticket
Window to your left, sir.

23:34.582 --> 23:35.571
They'll help you
reach your party.

23:35.616 --> 23:37.049
Next.

23:39.587 --> 23:41.214
-Ooh, watch it.
-Sorry, man.

23:41.255 --> 23:42.279
Peace.

23:42.323 --> 23:43.984
The Grateful Dead's
next month.

23:44.024 --> 23:46.015
Have your l.D.s ready.

23:46.060 --> 23:47.721
You must have your l.D.s.

23:51.565 --> 23:54.193
My wallet!

23:54.235 --> 23:55.395
Hey!

23:57.538 --> 24:00.769
We have a new member,
as you can all see.

24:00.808 --> 24:01.832
His name is Dylan.

24:01.876 --> 24:03.434
Move him into the circle.

24:03.477 --> 24:05.240
He's avoiding us.

24:06.547 --> 24:08.412
Would you like
to move in, Dylan?

24:12.453 --> 24:13.511
Not yet.

24:13.554 --> 24:14.578
All right.

24:14.622 --> 24:17.182
l'll accept that.

24:17.224 --> 24:18.953
Okay, let me introduce
you to the group.

24:18.993 --> 24:20.426
Shira,

24:20.461 --> 24:24.329
Joe, Mitch, Dee, Rich

24:24.365 --> 24:26.458
and Charley.

24:27.635 --> 24:28.693
How you doing?

24:28.736 --> 24:30.704
Oh, we're doing
great, genius.

24:30.738 --> 24:33.730
Yeah, we're just about one step
away from the padded room.

24:33.774 --> 24:36.572
Thank you for that
reminder, Charley.

24:36.610 --> 24:37.975
Okay, when we broke up yesterday

24:38.012 --> 24:39.343
we were talking about
the difference

24:39.380 --> 24:42.713
between guilt
and responsibility.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.809
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

24:44.852 --> 24:45.819
We have a newcomer.

24:45.853 --> 24:47.150
l want to know

24:47.187 --> 24:49.951
what his problem is before we
start opening our veins up.

24:49.990 --> 24:51.457
Not much to say.

24:51.492 --> 24:53.392
l guess your hat
says it all, huh?

24:53.427 --> 24:55.622
Stones Man.

24:55.663 --> 24:57.631
You a junkie or
just a drunk?

24:57.665 --> 24:59.633
Hey, l'm just a guy
wearing a hat.

24:59.667 --> 25:01.601
Why don't you get off
my back and relax?

25:01.635 --> 25:02.966
Don't you tell me to relax.

25:03.003 --> 25:04.766
Hey, hey, that's
enough, Charley. Sit down.

25:04.805 --> 25:07.137
Sit down!

25:11.612 --> 25:14.240
You're dominating
the group again.

25:14.281 --> 25:15.908
Somebody else speak,
please.

25:15.950 --> 25:18.680
Did you go to West Beverly High?

25:18.719 --> 25:21.654
Yeah, Class of '93.

25:21.689 --> 25:23.247
Hmm, l thought so.

25:23.290 --> 25:24.985
l was two years ahead of you.

25:25.092 --> 25:27.583
lsn't that sweet?

25:27.628 --> 25:29.255
Another over-privileged
meltdown.

25:30.631 --> 25:32.155
l love having rich boys
for dinner.

25:32.199 --> 25:33.757
Hey, do l know you?

25:33.801 --> 25:36.793
Oh, you will, oh, yes.

25:36.837 --> 25:38.771
We having fun now!

25:38.806 --> 25:40.774
Hmm?

25:52.853 --> 25:54.718
Ma'am, l need your
stubs to get back in.

25:59.426 --> 26:00.518
Ritchie!

26:00.561 --> 26:01.926
Oh!

26:07.534 --> 26:09.263
Programs.

26:09.303 --> 26:12.500
Programs. Programs.

26:12.539 --> 26:14.097
Hot dogs!

26:14.141 --> 26:15.199
Hey, Donna,

26:15.242 --> 26:17.938
let's work our way
towards the tunnel.

26:17.978 --> 26:19.377
The Stones are coming
on stage soon.

26:19.413 --> 26:21.176
Okay, l'll be right there.

26:24.251 --> 26:26.481
Donna?

26:26.520 --> 26:27.646
Donna!

26:27.688 --> 26:30.384
Steve?

26:30.424 --> 26:31.516
Donna!

26:31.558 --> 26:32.616
Where are you?!

26:32.660 --> 26:34.457
Donna, out here!

26:39.199 --> 26:41.531
Oh, Donna...

26:42.803 --> 26:44.998
Why are you wearing
that ridiculous getup?

26:45.105 --> 26:47.005
Selling programs.
Why, you want one?

26:47.041 --> 26:48.008
No.

26:48.042 --> 26:49.839
l want to get in.
l need a ticket!

26:49.877 --> 26:51.003
Some hippie dude
jacked my wallet.

26:51.045 --> 26:52.012
He stole my cash,

26:52.079 --> 26:53.876
my credit cards,
my l.D., everything!

26:53.914 --> 26:56.007
l've got a major business
meeting backstage.

26:56.050 --> 26:57.312
l need to get in.

26:57.351 --> 27:00.013
Hey, Donna,
you all right?

27:00.054 --> 27:01.544
Yeah, l am,
but Steve's not.

27:01.588 --> 27:02.953
You remember my
friend Steve, right?

27:02.990 --> 27:04.457
Yeah, sure, KEG House.

27:04.491 --> 27:05.549
Yeah.

27:05.592 --> 27:07.787
Do you think there's any way
we can get Steve in?

27:07.828 --> 27:09.728
lnto the show? Sure.

27:09.763 --> 27:11.060
Uh, you know what,
a hundred bucks

27:11.098 --> 27:13.123
l can probably scalp
a great ticket out here, man.

27:13.167 --> 27:14.691
l'd really appreciate that.

27:14.735 --> 27:16.760
Hey, you don't need to pay, man.
l'll get you in for free.

27:16.804 --> 27:17.771
What size are you?

27:17.805 --> 27:21.332
Why do you want to know my size?

27:21.375 --> 27:22.774
lce cream.

27:22.810 --> 27:24.368
lce cream...

27:26.647 --> 27:28.945
-Yeah, can l get an ice cream?
-Beat it.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.313
Hey, where can l change?

27:30.350 --> 27:31.442
Bathroom's right
over there.

27:31.485 --> 27:33.976
You saved my butt, man.

27:34.021 --> 27:36.353
-l'm gonna make this up to you
someday. -Hey, no problem.

27:36.390 --> 27:40.520
Now with a little luck l'll be
in the VlP lounge in no time.

27:42.596 --> 27:46.464
Good evening, Pasadena
and Los Angeles.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.695
Hey, Sue, can you...
can you take these?

27:48.736 --> 27:50.328
We're gonna grab
a couple of sodas.

27:50.370 --> 27:56.741
...Rolling Stones,
Voodoo Lounge tour, 1994.

27:56.777 --> 27:58.642
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this time

27:58.679 --> 28:01.477
we would like you to all
clear the aisles and concourses

28:01.515 --> 28:03.312
and take your seats.

28:11.391 --> 28:14.019
I'm gonna tell you
how it's gonna be

28:16.096 --> 28:18.656
You're gonna give
your love to me

28:20.300 --> 28:23.895
Love to last
more than one day

28:25.739 --> 28:27.934
Love is love
and not fade away

28:30.511 --> 28:33.173
Love is love
and not fade away

28:35.249 --> 28:39.185
ln summation, the court
must understand

28:39.219 --> 28:42.188
that after the tragic death
of Josh Richland,

28:42.222 --> 28:45.487
there was no precedent or
language in the Constitution

28:45.526 --> 28:49.963
that accorded the vice president
automatic succession.

28:49.997 --> 28:53.797
And so if Brandon Walsh had not
illegally seized the presidency

28:53.834 --> 28:56.132
for his own aggrandizement,

28:56.170 --> 28:58.001
there would have been
a new election,

28:58.038 --> 29:01.906
which is all we're asking for.

29:01.942 --> 29:02.909
Thank you

29:02.943 --> 29:05.173
Very good.

29:06.547 --> 29:08.913
Now, l'd like
to suggest...

29:08.949 --> 29:10.041
Oh...

29:10.083 --> 29:11.607
Excuse me.

29:13.420 --> 29:16.947
Ah, if it's all right
with my colleagues

29:17.057 --> 29:19.252
we'll reconvene
in 15 minutes,

29:19.293 --> 29:21.921
with Mr. Walsh's
defense.

29:25.766 --> 29:27.757
Why don't they just
rule against me,

29:27.801 --> 29:29.098
and get this thing over with?

29:29.136 --> 29:30.228
Brandon, you have to keep

29:30.270 --> 29:31.828
all that negativity
out of your head.

29:31.872 --> 29:33.601
He's busy thinking
about the concert.

29:33.640 --> 29:34.937
No, what l'm
thinking about

29:34.975 --> 29:36.374
is the French Revolution.

29:36.410 --> 29:38.207
l mean, back then
justice was swift.

29:38.245 --> 29:39.303
They didn't spend an hour

29:39.346 --> 29:40.711
dragging your name
through the mud,

29:40.747 --> 29:42.044
they just lopped your head off.

29:46.587 --> 29:48.851
l can't believe
l wasted all my time,

29:48.889 --> 29:50.220
holding all those
Senate meetings.

29:50.257 --> 29:52.919
Wait a second, l thought
you said the only time

29:52.960 --> 29:55.121
you had a quorum was during
that Roland Turner business.

29:55.162 --> 29:56.322
That's right,

29:56.363 --> 29:57.990
but l still called
every meeting to order.

29:58.031 --> 29:59.123
You did?

29:59.166 --> 30:00.190
Yeah.

30:00.234 --> 30:02.964
Ah, that's interesting.

30:04.972 --> 30:06.940
Take off the hat, squid!

30:06.974 --> 30:07.941
Leave him alone, Charley!

30:07.975 --> 30:10.307
Not until he takes
off that hat.

30:10.344 --> 30:12.209
Because we're trying
to get clean and that hat

30:12.246 --> 30:14.214
is about getting high.

30:14.248 --> 30:15.875
lt is about being cool.

30:15.916 --> 30:17.850
lt's about par-tay.

30:17.885 --> 30:19.284
No, l think you got it
backwards, man.

30:19.319 --> 30:20.286
The hat's a gift.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.912
That's it, a gift
from a friend of mine.

30:21.955 --> 30:23.650
lt reminds me l got
some people on the outside

30:23.690 --> 30:24.679
l'm trying to get straight for.

30:24.725 --> 30:26.693
Oh, how pious, man.
So tell me,

30:26.727 --> 30:29.252
what do you think their music
sounds better on, huh?

30:29.296 --> 30:31.924
-Coke, speed, heroin, what?
-On nothing!

30:31.965 --> 30:33.262
So now you're
the un-stoned man?

30:33.300 --> 30:35.029
Yeah. l hate to
break it to you.

30:35.102 --> 30:37.127
lt's true, l was sober
for two years

30:37.170 --> 30:39.502
and you know what, the music
sounded the same to me.

30:39.539 --> 30:41.871
That is such an immense
crock, dipstick.

30:43.176 --> 30:45.303
l'll tell you something,
l've been at the party

30:45.345 --> 30:47.404
a lot longer than
anybody in this room.

30:47.447 --> 30:51.508
And they don't call it sex,
drugs and rock and roll

30:51.551 --> 30:54.486
for nothing, because they
go hand in hand in hand.

30:54.521 --> 30:56.284
Yeah, well, l don't know
which party you've been to,

30:56.323 --> 30:58.223
but the people at the real
party, they don't stay there

30:58.258 --> 31:00.249
too long 'cause you stay long
enough, you end up dead.

31:00.294 --> 31:02.728
Why aren't you dead?!
Tell me!

31:02.763 --> 31:04.128
Why are you still alive?!

31:04.164 --> 31:07.861
Just take that hat off, kid.

31:07.901 --> 31:08.993
l'm not taking off the hat,

31:09.036 --> 31:10.503
'cause l have no problems
with the hat.

31:10.537 --> 31:12.767
You, on the other hand,
you got a big problem with it

31:12.806 --> 31:13.898
and you know why?
l think you're

31:13.941 --> 31:15.169
the one who can't
listen to the music

31:15.208 --> 31:17.005
without getting high.
That's what l think.

31:17.077 --> 31:20.274
l don't have to stay here
and listen to this.

31:20.314 --> 31:21.906
Oh, Charley...

31:21.949 --> 31:24.315
Charley!

31:25.419 --> 31:30.015
Okay, why is Charley angry?

31:30.123 --> 31:32.353
Anybody?

31:32.392 --> 31:35.623
Because he knows
Dylan's right--

31:35.662 --> 31:37.527
that hat definitely makes
him want to get wasted.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.327
Me, too.

31:43.670 --> 31:45.604
Jesse, l wouldn't try
any procedural games.

31:45.639 --> 31:46.970
Dershenbaum might
get steamed.

31:47.007 --> 31:48.975
Just stick to your
original defense.

31:49.009 --> 31:50.874
Brandon's been unfairly
targeted.

31:50.911 --> 31:53.038
What do you think, Brandon?
You think it's too risky?

31:53.146 --> 31:55.546
l say if we're going down,
let's go down swinging.

31:56.583 --> 31:59.347
Two macho guys.

31:59.386 --> 32:01.479
Ah, he's back. Here we go.

32:04.291 --> 32:07.454
l'm sorry for
the hideous delay.

32:07.494 --> 32:13.126
My mother is 95 years old, and
she's not getting any younger.

32:13.166 --> 32:17.466
Now... we have Mr. Vasquez
representing Mr. Walsh

32:17.504 --> 32:18.869
to present the defense.

32:18.905 --> 32:20.167
Mr. Vasquez.

32:20.207 --> 32:21.697
Your Honor, at this time,

32:21.742 --> 32:24.575
l'd like to ask the court
to dismiss this complaint.

32:24.611 --> 32:26.579
You know, Counselor,

32:26.613 --> 32:28.843
when l want a good laugh,
l watch Letterman.

32:28.882 --> 32:31.112
On what possible
grounds are you

32:31.151 --> 32:32.277
basing your motion?

32:32.319 --> 32:34.913
Simply, sir,
that the terms of succession

32:34.955 --> 32:37.287
are in fact self-evident in
the University Constitution,

32:37.324 --> 32:39.622
where it clearly
states, ''The Senate

32:39.659 --> 32:41.422
is called to order
by the president.''

32:41.461 --> 32:42.928
The fact is,

32:42.963 --> 32:44.897
the Senate has been
meeting continuously

32:44.931 --> 32:47.900
during this school year because
Brandon Walsh cared enough

32:47.934 --> 32:49.265
to call every meeting to order.

32:49.302 --> 32:50.599
l object.

32:50.637 --> 32:53.162
By presiding over every
meeting, every week, Your Honor,

32:53.206 --> 32:54.639
Brandon Walsh has
single-handedly maintained

32:54.674 --> 32:56.608
the integrity
of his office

32:56.643 --> 32:58.941
and therefore should be legally
recognized as president.

32:58.979 --> 33:00.776
Your Honor, at most

33:00.814 --> 33:02.748
of those meetings,
no Senators were there.

33:02.783 --> 33:05.479
One moment, Counselor.

33:08.321 --> 33:09.618
What's your opinion?

33:14.728 --> 33:16.218
Objection overruled.

33:16.263 --> 33:18.925
And as far
as Mr. Vasquez's request

33:18.965 --> 33:20.159
for dismissal is concerned:

33:20.200 --> 33:23.692
the University's constitution
may not be clear

33:23.737 --> 33:25.102
regarding rules of succession,

33:25.138 --> 33:27.834
but l for one can't think
of a better or quicker

33:27.874 --> 33:30.001
way to establish
precedent.

33:30.077 --> 33:33.103
Motion to dismiss
granted two to one.

33:34.147 --> 33:35.774
This Review Board is over.

33:35.816 --> 33:37.306
Good night, people.

33:37.350 --> 33:39.375
And congratulations,
Mr. President.

33:40.821 --> 33:43.346
Let the record show,
l dissented.

33:43.390 --> 33:45.017
That's great!

33:45.058 --> 33:47.117
So, did l win?

33:47.160 --> 33:48.593
Boy, did you get lucky.

33:48.628 --> 33:50.186
Uh-uh, he had
a clever lawyer.

33:50.230 --> 33:51.458
A good lawyer
with a gutsy client.

33:51.498 --> 33:53.193
Well, thanks to both of you.

33:53.233 --> 33:54.461
You know, if you hurry up,

33:54.501 --> 33:55.627
you can still catch
that concert.

33:55.669 --> 33:56.829
You want to come with me?

33:56.870 --> 33:57.837
Oh, no.

33:57.871 --> 33:59.862
No, late nights l still turn
into a bartender.

33:59.906 --> 34:00.930
But take my wife, please.

34:00.974 --> 34:02.066
l can't.

34:02.109 --> 34:04.134
Of course you can, we're
going to the Voodoo Lounge.

34:04.177 --> 34:05.838
Let's go.
Say good-bye.

34:05.879 --> 34:06.846
Congratulations.

34:06.880 --> 34:07.972
l'm glad the
revolution's over.

34:08.081 --> 34:09.639
Yeah, we should talk, Janice.

34:09.683 --> 34:10.650
We will.

34:15.455 --> 34:16.978
No hard feelings, Walsh.

34:17.023 --> 34:18.614
No hard feelings, Alex.

34:18.658 --> 34:20.819
But that's ''Mr. President''
to you.

34:45.018 --> 34:46.781
What do you mean
his pager's off?

34:46.820 --> 34:48.981
He lives for his pager.

34:50.257 --> 34:51.952
Clare, where are
you going?

34:51.992 --> 34:53.425
A cab stand comes to mind.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.018
Good night. l'm going home.

34:55.128 --> 34:56.322
But the tickets are coming.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.228
Like l care anymore!

34:58.265 --> 35:00.699
l'm cold, l'm cranky.

35:00.734 --> 35:03.396
God, you know,
l wish we'd never even come.

35:06.907 --> 35:08.431
Let me call you back.

35:15.015 --> 35:16.778
How can we end
this nightmare?

35:16.816 --> 35:19.376
Oh, come on.

35:19.419 --> 35:21.580
Just wait here
with me.

35:23.056 --> 35:26.219
You know, their music's
really not that bad.

35:30.430 --> 35:32.955
Hey, you want to buy
some tickets? Cheap!

35:34.801 --> 35:36.200
Oh...

35:43.076 --> 35:47.775
What are you scared of, baby?

35:47.814 --> 35:49.782
l'm telling you
that's my name there.

35:49.816 --> 35:52.284
That is my name!
That's me! Look!

35:52.319 --> 35:53.445
This is me
right there!
Excuse me.

35:53.486 --> 35:54.851
lf you would just go
get Ms. Wells.

35:54.888 --> 35:55.946
l'm telling you,
l'm Steve Sanders!

35:55.989 --> 35:57.786
That may be true, sir,
but without an l.D.,

35:57.824 --> 35:59.189
l can't let you in.
l'm sorry.

35:59.226 --> 36:01.456
lf you would just go get Ms.
Wells, l'm telling you, she'd

36:01.494 --> 36:04.691
clear this whole thing up.
l am the real Steve Sanders...

36:04.731 --> 36:06.130
Kelly, tell him who l am.

36:06.166 --> 36:07.360
Who are ya?

36:07.400 --> 36:10.301
Tell him, tell him who l am.

36:10.337 --> 36:12.703
lt's true.
He's Steve Sanders.

36:12.739 --> 36:13.831
l'll vouch for him.

36:13.873 --> 36:14.931
All right, you wait here.

36:14.975 --> 36:16.203
l'll get Ms. Wells.

36:16.243 --> 36:18.268
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

36:18.311 --> 36:19.710
Where have you been?

36:19.746 --> 36:20.872
You don't want to know.

36:20.914 --> 36:22.438
l'm starving,
l'm famished.

36:22.482 --> 36:24.177
Try the lobster quiche.

36:24.217 --> 36:25.707
Oh, this is my style. Mm!

36:25.752 --> 36:27.219
Five minutes out there
with the masses

36:27.254 --> 36:29.154
and l start getting a hive,
l'm telling you.

36:31.358 --> 36:33.417
Yes, l think
this is my man.

36:33.460 --> 36:34.427
All right.

36:34.461 --> 36:36.361
Here, you're
gonna need this.

36:36.396 --> 36:37.658
Thank you, Claudette.

36:37.697 --> 36:38.561
Well, what happened to you?

36:38.598 --> 36:41.897
Um, some hippie dude stole
my wallet.

36:41.935 --> 36:44.233
He's out there with my name,
my credit cards, everything.

36:44.271 --> 36:46.000
But it doesn't matter now
because l'm here.

36:46.039 --> 36:47.438
We can talk about my concept...

36:47.474 --> 36:48.441
Oh, hold that thought.

36:48.475 --> 36:49.442
The band's cooking. Come on.

36:49.476 --> 36:51.137
-Where we going?
-Dancing. -Dancing?

36:51.177 --> 36:52.144
Come on!

36:53.513 --> 36:54.502
The apple, the apple!

36:54.547 --> 36:55.673
Here!

37:00.820 --> 37:02.287
lf you need
an extra pillow,

37:02.322 --> 37:04.790
talk to Oscar,
the floor man.

37:04.824 --> 37:06.724
Everybody else in this place
will stonewall you.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.727
Excuse me?

37:07.761 --> 37:11.322
Eh, it's just a helpful hint.

37:11.364 --> 37:13.093
l can get you cigarettes, too...

37:13.133 --> 37:14.691
if you need 'em.

37:14.734 --> 37:16.258
l don't need 'em.

37:16.303 --> 37:18.498
Nicotine's the one drug
l've managed to avoid.

37:18.538 --> 37:19.869
-Hmm. -So when Oscar
brings this pillow,

37:19.906 --> 37:22.067
is he gonna do me the
favor of taking you away

37:22.108 --> 37:23.541
or do l get to do
that myself?

37:23.576 --> 37:24.838
Oh, come on.

37:24.878 --> 37:27.369
l give every new fish
the third degree.

37:27.414 --> 37:28.642
l've got a reputation to uphold.

37:28.682 --> 37:30.775
A reputation for what, being

37:30.817 --> 37:32.284
obnoxious?

37:32.319 --> 37:34.719
And charming, too, you'll find.

37:34.754 --> 37:37.985
Hey, l was a rich brat, too.

37:39.626 --> 37:41.958
Look, don't even tell me
this is the spot

37:41.995 --> 37:43.724
where you start telling me
we're gonna be buddies.

37:43.763 --> 37:45.628
l'm gonna tell you right now,
dude, l will puke.

37:45.665 --> 37:47.428
No, no. l could never
be friends

37:47.467 --> 37:50.493
with anybody who shows so little
respect for their elders.

37:50.537 --> 37:54.132
Well, elder, let me tell you
how it is.

37:54.174 --> 37:56.005
l came to this place
to get better.

37:56.109 --> 37:57.599
You're just making it worse.

37:57.644 --> 37:58.611
Wrong.

37:58.645 --> 38:01.739
''What does not kill you
will make you stronger.''

38:01.781 --> 38:03.544
Now think about it.

38:03.583 --> 38:06.746
Because l was tough on you
in there, you got stronger.

38:06.786 --> 38:07.775
So what?

38:07.821 --> 38:09.789
Well, then you got tough on me,
l folded.

38:09.823 --> 38:10.949
Yeah, you folded.

38:10.990 --> 38:12.958
You're sitting in my room
feeling sorry for yourself.

38:13.026 --> 38:15.859
No, no, man, what l'm saying...

38:18.398 --> 38:22.198
Nobody else in this place has
got the juice to take me on.

38:22.235 --> 38:23.361
What, you mean you're telling me

38:23.403 --> 38:24.301
you actually liked that
in there?

38:24.337 --> 38:27.966
Yeah, yeah, listen, listen,

38:28.007 --> 38:30.373
l gotta get my act together
this time.

38:30.410 --> 38:34.073
l am 42 years old.

38:35.582 --> 38:37.812
This go-round
is gonna be my last.

38:46.960 --> 38:49.053
l'll do what l can.

38:51.564 --> 38:53.191
Good...

38:53.233 --> 38:54.962
good.

38:58.872 --> 39:00.464
So about that Stones hat?

39:00.507 --> 39:02.270
What, you are still after me
about the hat?

39:02.308 --> 39:03.275
Yeah.

39:03.309 --> 39:05.869
Can l borrow it?

39:13.953 --> 39:16.387
l don't think it'll kill you.

39:17.824 --> 39:19.587
That's the idea.

39:33.072 --> 39:35.199
If you start me up

39:35.241 --> 39:38.608
If you start me up,
I'll never stop

39:40.880 --> 39:45.874
I can't compete with the riders
in the other heat

39:48.822 --> 39:50.790
Backstage pass!
Backstage pass!

39:50.824 --> 39:52.985
You made a grown man cry

39:53.059 --> 39:57.189
You made a grown man cry

39:57.230 --> 40:00.757
You made a grown man cry

40:00.800 --> 40:04.531
Ride like the wind
at double speed

40:04.571 --> 40:08.632
I'll take you places
that you never, never seen

40:12.312 --> 40:13.574
Start me up

40:15.849 --> 40:20.946
You, you, you made
a grown man cry

40:23.323 --> 40:24.381
Start me up/

40:27.393 --> 40:29.361
All right.

40:29.395 --> 40:30.987
Whoo!

40:35.034 --> 40:38.265
If i could stick a knife
in my heart

40:38.304 --> 40:42.240
A suicide right on the stage

40:42.275 --> 40:46.177
Would it satisfy ya or
would it slide on by ya?

40:46.212 --> 40:48.976
Would it help to ease
the pain?

40:49.015 --> 40:52.314
Ease the pai-ai-ain

40:52.352 --> 40:54.183
i said i know

40:54.220 --> 40:57.986
it's only
rock 'n'roll, but i like it

41:00.894 --> 41:05.126
i know it's only
rock 'n'roll, but i like it

41:07.133 --> 41:08.930
Whoo!

41:08.968 --> 41:14.065
i know it's only rock
'n'roll, but i like it

41:15.275 --> 41:20.474
i know it's only
rock 'n'roll, but i like it

41:20.513 --> 41:23.107
Like it, yes, i do.
