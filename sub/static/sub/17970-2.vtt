00:24.733 --> 00:26.275
Where is she? Where is she?!

00:45.212 --> 00:47.422
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.943
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.330
I have something you want.
Left pocket.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.429
I beg you, don't kill me.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.733
Brother Jerome.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.902
Brother Carson.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.536
I told Michael
you wanted to join the harvest.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.579
I hope I didn't overstep.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.749
Michael always says
to each his own path.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.837
When you're done here,
come join us in the orchard.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.547
Thank you.

03:40.804 --> 03:41.804
Alan?

03:44.516 --> 03:45.558
Alan!

03:45.976 --> 03:46.976
Alan!

03:47.978 --> 03:49.729
Alan!

04:18.425 --> 04:19.467
Alan?

04:24.973 --> 04:26.057
Alan.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.020
Wait. Wait.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.692
Wait.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.211
What are you looking for?

05:37.379 --> 05:38.754
A shovel.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.339
For what?

05:40.924 --> 05:42.550
To dig up Alan Farragut's grave.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.512
-He left something for me.
-Like what?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.431
Only one way to find out.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.603
The dead should rest.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.440
He's rested enough.
It's time for him to get back to work.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.451
Thanks for so many of you
coming to counsel today.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.038
I know sometimes
I get so wrapped up in my work...

06:12.205 --> 06:16.625
...I forget the promises that I made
to each of you when you arrived.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.879
The promise that I would be
nothing for myself...

06:20.047 --> 06:23.883
...everything for each of you
and more time for us.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.804
It's very hard, what we do here.

06:28.972 --> 06:34.143
We've left a world
where all we ever did...

06:34.311 --> 06:37.521
...was give in
to other people's demands...

06:37.689 --> 06:41.150
...their ideas for who we are.

06:43.612 --> 06:49.825
A world
where we measured ourselves...

06:49.993 --> 06:51.410
...by other people's approval.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.419
It's not easy leaving all of that behind.

07:00.587 --> 07:04.507
We surrendered ourselves
to a simple life...

07:04.674 --> 07:11.013
...and by the loss of the self,
we became truly...

07:11.181 --> 07:12.181
...individuals.

07:14.309 --> 07:18.771
And we are free, to simply...

07:20.482 --> 07:21.524
...be.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.319
Say it with me, Rob.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.324
-I am.
-I am.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.494
-You're what?
-Nothing.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.454
-I just am.
-That's right.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.333
You surrender, and you just are.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.335
Thanks, Rob.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.138
Mother?

08:04.985 --> 08:06.694
Mother?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.571
Where are you, Mother?

08:09.406 --> 08:12.199
-Where are you?
-Soren.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.702
Soren.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.207
Get him off. Soren, stop!

08:21.793 --> 08:25.171
-Stop, Soren. Soren. Get him off.
-Let me go!

08:25.338 --> 08:26.547
Let me go!

08:26.715 --> 08:27.840
Somebody help her.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.682
Let me go.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.228
He's all right. Just don't move.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.454
Peter, the pathogen is here.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.789
-It's in the Abbey.
-What? Who?

09:00.957 --> 09:04.251
A child. A boy. He was exhibiting
all the symptoms we saw on the boat.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.254
-He should be in quarantine.
-We gotta lock this place down.

09:09.257 --> 09:13.761
You're all here. Good. Good.
Sit. Sit, please.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.558
Dr. Jordan, I wasn't expecting
to see you this morning.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.645
She disobeyed your orders.
The punishment is expulsion.

09:22.812 --> 09:26.315
I'm aware of the policy
regarding skeptics, Anne.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.235
But she kept Olivia's injuries
from getting a lot worse.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.655
As I've told our guests,
we don't tolerate intrusion from the outside.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.990
And ordinarily, I would agree.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.160
But I think we all know
that there is something amiss here.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.497
The boy, Soren,
he's very sick, isn't he?

09:41.665 --> 09:43.290
Yes, he is.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.751
And he's not the only one.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.171
I saw a man this morning infected,
same symptoms.

09:49.339 --> 09:52.675
-An adult male, late 20s.
-Brother Isaac.

09:54.678 --> 09:58.472
-You knew?
-Dr. Jordan, I'm sorry...

09:58.640 --> 10:02.851
...but we live on an island that's
400 miles from the nearest fast food joint.

10:03.311 --> 10:08.482
We've got no convenience stores,
no anti-depressants, no World Wide Web.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.610
We're completely self-sufficient
and we take care of our own...

10:11.778 --> 10:14.238
...which is why I'm not very good
at asking for help.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.031
But I'm doing that now.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.492
Dr. Farragut,
if we give you our cooperation...

10:18.660 --> 10:21.245
...is there any way you think
you can find this disease?

10:21.413 --> 10:23.914
-Get rid of it?
-We're not equipped for containment.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.500
We expected to observe
and take samples.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.544
What if you had
the right equipment?

10:28.712 --> 10:30.546
Coast Guard won't be back
for two weeks.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.881
Unless you have a helicopter
hidden somewhere....

10:33.049 --> 10:37.094
No, we don't, but we do have
a pretty well-equipped botany lab.

10:37.262 --> 10:40.889
The equipment is not exactly current,
but it'd be at your disposal.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.057
We'll need a lab...

10:42.225 --> 10:44.810
...as well as a quarantine
for any infected patients.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.730
Anne, see that our friends
get everything they need.

10:47.897 --> 10:48.897
Of course.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.066
Our biggest concern now
is containment.

10:51.234 --> 10:54.069
So we need to find this Brother Isaac
immediately.

10:54.237 --> 10:57.573
If this illness gets off this island,
we could be facing a pandemic.

10:57.741 --> 11:01.118
We'll set up search teams.
Whatever you need.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.912
Please help us
figure out a way to stop this.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.947
Oh, hold it. I hit something.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.573
You find what you were looking for?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.325
No.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.162
Why not?

12:28.123 --> 12:30.833
Because this isn't Alan Farragut.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.090
Gently. Gently.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.299
It's okay, Soren.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.760
Gently.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.303
It's okay, Soren. It's okay.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.472
It's okay. We're gonna help you.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.440
The last person to see Isaac
said he was headed to the basement.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.860
Everybody, stay on your toes.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.165
We're going in circles.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.041
Let's split up.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.795
-Cover twice as much ground that way.
-Twice as likely to get lost.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.005
Your call, boss.

13:19.382 --> 13:22.050
You, you, with me.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.969
Sir.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.373
Stay sharp.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.584
He could be anywhere.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.893
Leave! Get the hell out of here!
I'll kill you!

14:48.429 --> 14:50.389
The hell did he go?

15:02.527 --> 15:04.361
-You find Isaac?
-More like he found us.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.822
He-- He got away.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.867
He could be anywhere by now. This place
is riddled with underground tunnels.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.162
Haven't seen a monocular microscope
in a while.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.583
-Like ever.
-You've been out of the field way too long.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.669
What's with all this equipment?

15:20.837 --> 15:22.504
Why does a cult need a botany lab?

15:22.672 --> 15:24.506
Part of Michael's grand design?

15:25.091 --> 15:28.844
Let's just focus on what we know. You
have the samples from the infected boy?

15:29.012 --> 15:30.470
Blood, urine and buccal swabs.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.348
And skin lesions too
in the event we can find a biopsy kit.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.183
How long until you can analyze them?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.810
Back in Seattle, two hours.

15:36.978 --> 15:40.272
-Here? At least 20.
-Okay.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.985
I....

15:47.280 --> 15:49.781
I've been trying to think of a way
to tell you this...

15:49.949 --> 15:52.034
...where you wouldn't freak out...

15:53.995 --> 15:55.829
...but Alan's here.

15:57.874 --> 16:01.043
-Alan's where?
-He's on the island.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.212
-He's dressed up like one of the followers.
-That's ridiculous.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.923
Look, I saw him this morning
outside my window.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.092
And then I saw him again....

16:09.260 --> 16:11.720
I saw him again
when Soren attacked his mother.

16:11.888 --> 16:15.474
-That makes no sense.
-I don't know, maybe it has to do with Ilaria.

16:17.185 --> 16:20.729
Why would Ilaria be interested
in some crackpot, isolationist cult?

16:20.897 --> 16:22.731
Why would my brother
be investigating?

16:22.899 --> 16:25.692
-Be surprised if he's here for the food.
-This isn't a joke.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.070
He has been discredited by the CDC.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.156
And don't forget about
the international arrest warrants.

16:31.324 --> 16:35.327
Whatever he is doing here,
we are to have no contact with him.

16:35.495 --> 16:39.122
-But it's Alan. Peter, he can help.
-No contact, Sarah.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.375
Everything okay, doctors?

16:41.542 --> 16:44.169
Yeah. Just a procedural question.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.964
Let's get back to work.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.555
Nothing to worry about.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.768
Soon as they get what they've come for,
they'll leave.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.520
But others will follow.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.438
We should expel them now.

17:04.107 --> 17:07.567
Nothing to find, so nothing to fear.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.904
-Is there?
-It's the disruption they cause.

17:14.283 --> 17:18.662
All these women, my grandmother,
her mother and her mother before her.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.872
All the way back to the beginning.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.626
We all knew what we had to protect.

17:24.794 --> 17:27.129
They've entrusted me with their legacy.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.755
I can't let them down.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.925
Sweet Anne.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.180
Well...

17:38.599 --> 17:42.728
...always looking at the big picture.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.480
But the boy, Soren...

17:45.648 --> 17:47.441
...and Isaac...

17:47.608 --> 17:48.817
...they're both very sick.

17:49.444 --> 17:53.405
All the more reason to find Isaac...

17:53.573 --> 17:55.991
...and cooperate with the doctors.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.327
Right?

18:35.865 --> 18:36.865
Isaac?

19:03.810 --> 19:06.686
-Hi, brother.
-Hello.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.815
-Afternoon, brother.
-Good day, brother.

19:11.025 --> 19:14.319
Jerome.
Michael asked if you'll join him.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.572
-After the picking?
-He wants to see you now.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.045
-I don't understand it. This isn't him?
-Not all of him anyway.

19:32.213 --> 19:35.590
The bones are from more than one person.
The skull is from a woman.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.093
A lot of people died on this island
years ago.

19:38.261 --> 19:40.595
-It'd be easy to mix them up.
-Yeah, not Alan.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.597
He never did anything
without a purpose.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.724
Dead or alive, there's a clue here.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.394
That's weird.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.063
You see the ilium?

19:51.315 --> 19:52.858
The hip bone.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.109
What about it?

19:54.277 --> 19:57.195
Most people have two fused together.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.322
This guy's got three.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.454
Does this mean anything to you?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.376
Afraid not.

20:12.795 --> 20:16.006
I.... I gotta go.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.926
-Where are you going?
-To check my traps.

20:33.441 --> 20:37.485
Jerome. Glad you could come by.
Would you like a cup of tea?

20:37.945 --> 20:39.946
-No. Thank you.
-Purple Oolong.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.573
Created it myself right here.

20:41.741 --> 20:45.285
Grafted a Mount Kenya varietal
with a Chinese leaf.

20:45.453 --> 20:46.578
Goes down easy.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.831
You're a geneticist?

20:49.999 --> 20:52.459
I'm an observer of intertwining fates.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.419
At any of the seven taxonomic ranks...

20:54.587 --> 20:58.006
...plants create new forms,
hence the massive number of species.

20:58.174 --> 21:02.177
And you're just helping create
a few new ones?

21:02.428 --> 21:05.055
-Nothing that wouldn't occur naturally.
-Only at random.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.474
Random. Yes.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.355
"What a book a devil's chaplain
might write...

21:13.564 --> 21:18.234
...on the clumsy, wasteful,
blundering, and horribly cruel work."

21:18.444 --> 21:22.238
Charles Darwin said that.
He didn't much care for slow or random.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.908
Spoken like a man
who knew him personally.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.328
Nothing is random, Jerome.

21:28.537 --> 21:32.082
Every path is created,
sometimes by outside forces.

21:32.291 --> 21:36.753
But there is not a random atom to be found
anywhere in the known universe.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.714
So everything has a purpose.

21:39.924 --> 21:43.009
No, Jerome. Everything has a reason.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.931
You've been here for three months.
Time to answer the fundamental question.

21:48.391 --> 21:50.517
Why did you come here?

21:52.561 --> 21:54.104
To find my true path.

21:55.690 --> 21:59.359
-So you randomly chose my order.
-There's more to it than that.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.863
I've done terrible things.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.116
Taken...

22:07.159 --> 22:08.910
...lives.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.834
My choices for self-discovery were...

22:16.043 --> 22:17.502
...limited.

22:18.796 --> 22:23.091
-So you're hiding?
-Aren't all of us hiding here? Even you?

22:24.468 --> 22:26.052
No. We're not hiding here.

22:27.555 --> 22:30.932
We confront our past
to put it behind us.

22:31.142 --> 22:34.394
We embrace our faults
to learn to love them.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.689
We face our pain
to be released from it.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.817
And when you start facing
your pain, Jerome...

22:41.027 --> 22:44.362
...only then will your healing begin.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.396
What the hell are you doing?

24:00.731 --> 24:03.274
-I'm isolating the pathogen.
-Without your safety gear?

24:05.194 --> 24:07.654
Look, I can work twice as fast
without my gear on.

24:07.863 --> 24:12.033
What if Kyle walks in here and sees you
working on a BSL-3 hot agent like that?

24:12.243 --> 24:14.577
Everyone who gets this disease dies.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.789
It won't affect me. We need to be
using every advantage we can.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.750
And how do we explain it?
I am telling you--

24:20.960 --> 24:23.253
You don't have the right
to tell me what I can do.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.004
I'm the only one who has the right.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.924
You've been fighting that
since they made me team leader.

24:28.092 --> 24:30.009
I know you think it should be you.

24:30.219 --> 24:33.596
-No, I don't wanna be team leader.
-Why do you oppose every order I give?

24:33.764 --> 24:36.850
Am I not allowed to think for myself?
Alan welcomed people's input.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.893
-Alan is not in charge here.
-Obviously.

24:39.103 --> 24:42.397
I decide who we talk to,
who we trust, who we confide in.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.232
If you have a problem,
let me know.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.442
If we have to,
we will work without you.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.487
-Come quick.
-What's wrong?

24:49.697 --> 24:50.864
Better see for yourself.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.213
Hey, Soren. How you feeling?

25:07.423 --> 25:09.799
Good, I guess. Where's my mom?

25:18.851 --> 25:21.936
His vitals are normal, he's coherent,
his symptoms are clearing up.

25:22.146 --> 25:26.191
-Six hours ago, he was having a seizure.
-No memory of it whatsoever.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.818
Let me talk to him.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.656
-Hey, Soren.
-Hi.

25:34.325 --> 25:35.325
You really scared us.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.035
I did?

25:37.244 --> 25:39.996
Yeah. Do you remember anything
about this morning?

25:40.206 --> 25:43.166
No, not really.
I had a really bad headache though.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.876
Yeah.

25:45.836 --> 25:48.755
Looks like this guy
had a really bad headache too.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.548
You wanna talk about his headache?

25:50.758 --> 25:53.134
He's just a toy.
He doesn't get headaches.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.303
And anyway,
he wouldn't remember either.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.972
Maybe some form
of anterograde amnesia?

25:58.182 --> 26:00.350
We won't know what it is
until we can build...

26:00.559 --> 26:03.770
...a full clinical profile
of whatever the hell this is.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.731
-Any luck finding Isaac?
-No, and we're quite concerned.

26:06.941 --> 26:09.192
Brother Landry thinks he may have
gone outside the gate.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.528
Thought you said that was dangerous.
What with the wolves and such.

26:12.738 --> 26:16.241
We take his disappearance
very seriously.

26:16.450 --> 26:19.953
-Soon as we find him, we'll let you know.
-We can get started without Isaac.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.747
We have to establish a connection
between him and Soren.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.500
Were they eating together?
Drinking from the same water?

26:25.668 --> 26:27.502
Where were when they
were each exposed?

26:27.711 --> 26:29.712
Dr. Jordan. Sarah.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.843
It's just a nosebleed. I'm fine.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.639
Okay. We'll keep Soren
here under observation.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.433
Just because he's asymptomatic
doesn't mean he's cured.

26:42.643 --> 26:47.814
Sister, is it possible to retrace Isaac
and Soren's steps over the last few days?

26:48.023 --> 26:49.565
Find a point of intersection?

26:49.775 --> 26:52.360
We follow a daily schedule
of work and counseling.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.321
Even the children
are expected to comply.

26:55.531 --> 26:59.534
Okay. I'll talk to Olivia, you two
map the infected patients' movements.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.995
Whatever this is,
it's hot and it's on the move.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.624
So this is where Isaac worked?

27:06.834 --> 27:08.376
Yes.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.921
Do the children
ever come down here?

27:12.089 --> 27:13.673
No.

27:15.342 --> 27:19.721
Your trees. They look like
Cortlands or Paula Reds.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.431
You know your apple cultivars.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.643
-How many children live here?
-Nearly 30, including the babies.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.895
Classes are held every day
after council hall.

27:28.105 --> 27:31.149
-They all sleep in the same place?
-And eat together as well.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.318
Do they get Mom and Dad time?

27:33.527 --> 27:36.279
Until they're 7. After that,
we're all Moms and Dads.

27:36.947 --> 27:39.699
So the kids choose elders
to help them find their path.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.452
A little young to be making
those kind of decisions, no?

27:42.661 --> 27:44.620
You have a closed mind
for a scientist.

27:46.874 --> 27:49.584
When can I talk to Soren?
Is he gonna be okay?

27:49.793 --> 27:51.085
You'll be with him soon.

27:51.295 --> 27:55.673
Did Soren do anything different in the last
few days? Anything out of his routine?

27:58.260 --> 28:00.928
I don't see Soren for most of the day.

28:01.138 --> 28:04.140
He's either with the other children
or receiving counseling.

28:04.350 --> 28:07.185
-Counseling?
-Instructions from their minders.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.813
We don't have punishments here.

28:11.148 --> 28:16.152
We help each other to realize
our individual wants and needs.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.906
-You get a lot of new arrivals?
-Some.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.992
But most people
have been here for generations.

28:23.619 --> 28:26.496
-And what about you?
-Island born and bred.

28:26.705 --> 28:30.583
Our apples are designed to withstand
the abuses of man and nature.

28:30.793 --> 28:35.713
-Insects, disease, poor weather and soil--
-Designed? Like GMOs?

28:35.923 --> 28:39.675
Oh, nothing so fancy.
We follow the old ways.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.888
You're grafting. Combining different traits
from different strains of fruit.

28:44.098 --> 28:46.599
Do you know a man named Isaac?

28:47.601 --> 28:49.060
I know him, yes.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.524
You ever consider leaving?

28:54.733 --> 28:55.858
Why would I do that?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.820
See the world, meet new people.

28:59.196 --> 29:02.115
What can you people offer me
that I can't get right here?

29:02.282 --> 29:04.200
You never know
until you give it a try.

29:04.410 --> 29:08.496
Do you mind if I take
a few bark and soil samples?

29:08.705 --> 29:10.540
I don't see how that could hurt.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.793
Both he and your son
fell ill at the same time.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.796
Could he have passed the illness
on to Soren? Or vice versa?

29:17.005 --> 29:19.382
Children are never alone
with the adults.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.971
The children are never alone.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.229
Come. I wanna show you something.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.745
What...? What'd you wanna show me?

29:51.206 --> 29:53.249
What do you wanna see?

29:59.089 --> 30:00.298
Or maybe...

30:02.468 --> 30:03.885
...you can show me?

30:05.095 --> 30:06.220
Show you what?

30:07.055 --> 30:09.140
What you people have.

30:10.184 --> 30:12.810
What my family on the island doesn't.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.022
Whoa, whoa, whoa, now.

30:18.108 --> 30:19.692
Show me.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.447
Show me.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.451
Be my path.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.581
Be my path.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.377
Stop it. Stop.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.718
I have to get back to my work.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.434
Do you have any other questions?

30:55.354 --> 30:56.395
Nope.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.045
Can I speak to one of your pickers?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.422
If you must, but be brief.

31:27.177 --> 31:31.806
Excuse me. I'm Dr. Sarah Jordan.
Can I speak with you, Brother...?

31:32.015 --> 31:33.558
Jerome.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.351
Of course.

31:37.688 --> 31:40.523
I just wanted to thank you
for your help earlier with the boy.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.067
Most people
would've been too scared.

31:43.277 --> 31:47.071
I don't want to see him hurt
or see him hurt anyone.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.533
There's enough violence in the world.
We can agree to that.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.369
Sister, may we have a word?

31:55.706 --> 31:59.041
-You need to get out of here now. Today.
-Alan, what are you doing here?

31:59.710 --> 32:01.586
Get Peter and the other guy...

32:01.795 --> 32:03.546
-...and get the hell out.
-I can't.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.007
The Coast Guard
won't be back for two weeks.

32:06.216 --> 32:10.011
Then go down to the dock and wait,
and pray you make it off this island alive.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.263
Why? What's going on?

32:12.806 --> 32:15.808
-Alan, tell me what's going on.
-Is everything all right?

32:15.976 --> 32:17.310
I'd like to get back to work.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.721
What do these carvings mean?

32:55.682 --> 32:57.141
They don't mean anything.

32:57.851 --> 33:01.103
Then why'd you run out of here
as soon as you saw them?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.731
You say you want to stop an outbreak.

33:05.442 --> 33:07.902
How do I know you're telling the truth?

33:11.031 --> 33:12.490
You don't.

33:13.575 --> 33:15.951
Then why should I believe you?

33:18.288 --> 33:20.206
Because I don't have time to lie.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.084
It's getting worse.

33:24.795 --> 33:28.089
-How long do you have?
-I don't know. Days maybe.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.091
Then why bother?

33:30.592 --> 33:34.512
Because the other choice is doing nothing,
and that's unacceptable.

33:39.059 --> 33:41.560
It's a map of the island.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.107
What's this right here?

33:48.777 --> 33:50.403
A place you don't want to go.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.865
-And neither do I.
-I have to go.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.326
Then you're not coming back.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.789
Why not? What's there?

34:06.253 --> 34:08.838
Why would he give that sign
if he didn't think we were in danger?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.881
I don't know.
Why does Alan do anything?

34:11.091 --> 34:13.676
Maybe he wants us to regroup,
wait for the Coast Guard.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.554
Maybe we're standing in his way
of killing someone else.

34:16.763 --> 34:17.972
He's telling us to run.

34:18.181 --> 34:22.268
I don't care what he's telling us.
We're the CDC. We don't run.

34:23.812 --> 34:26.147
That sounds like something
Alan would say.

34:29.401 --> 34:32.862
Come on.
Dr. Sommer's due to meet us in the lab.

34:36.992 --> 34:40.286
So this is what I've been able
to piece together.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.538
Everyone's tightly scheduled here.

34:42.748 --> 34:48.252
Work, eat, sleep, plus a healthy helping
of New Age philosophy.

34:48.462 --> 34:50.546
No one goes anywhere randomly.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.841
Doesn't look like Isaac and the kid
were around each other at all.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.218
So how are they the only two
who got sick?

34:56.428 --> 34:58.262
Maybe compromised
immune systems?

34:58.472 --> 35:01.390
No, Soren's T-cell count
was off the chart. The kid's healthy.

35:01.558 --> 35:03.017
What are we talking about here?

35:03.226 --> 35:05.686
Twenty-seven victims on that boat,
only two on the island.

35:05.896 --> 35:09.398
One missing, one asymptomatic
but possibly contagious as hell.

35:09.608 --> 35:10.816
Doesn't make sense.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.402
Olivia got pretty rattled
when I brought up Isaac.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.613
Swore Soren had never
been with him alone.

35:15.822 --> 35:20.367
-You think she's lying?
-Someone is. We need to find out who.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.708
-How much farther?
-You won't get there till tomorrow.

35:27.918 --> 35:31.712
-Tomorrow?
-This terrain isn't the friendliest.

35:31.922 --> 35:34.173
Pretty easy to get lost.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.550
You could always come with me.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.721
I'll take you as far as the river.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.140
Then you're on your own.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.061
My God.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.151
This was a child.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.240
Predation marks on the bones.
Animals must've gotten to him.

35:59.449 --> 36:00.950
Or something worse.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.475
-You can't be in here.
-I have to talk to you.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.143
Sarah.

36:29.062 --> 36:32.815
-It's after curfew. If anyone catches you--
-Alan, the pathogen's on the island.

36:33.024 --> 36:37.152
-That boy this morning, he was infected.
-That's why I'm here. You have to go.

36:37.362 --> 36:40.406
Did you know that 27 people
were killed on a ship 12 miles out?

36:40.615 --> 36:43.033
-They got off the island.
-Yeah.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.536
We don't know how it spread
or how to stop it.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.581
You can help figure this out.
I've started collecting samples.

36:48.748 --> 36:51.292
-No, I can't help you.
-Why not?

36:51.751 --> 36:54.128
Alan, what the hell happened to you?

36:54.337 --> 36:58.841
You disappeared, you quit the CDC.
There's rumors about bombings in Paris.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.509
I can't explain it right now.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.888
I thought you were dead.

37:05.223 --> 37:09.310
I had no idea what happened to you.
I find you and you won't tell me anything.

37:11.938 --> 37:16.609
Sarah, I can't. It's too dangerous
for you and for the team.

37:16.818 --> 37:20.613
You have to trust me.
This island is not what it seems.

37:20.822 --> 37:25.117
-You have to take the others and go.
-You owe me an explanation.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.162
And you owe our baby.

37:29.664 --> 37:30.873
Our what?

37:36.129 --> 37:38.255
Are you saying we have a child?

37:40.342 --> 37:42.760
No, Alan. There's no child.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.223
I'm so sorry.

37:48.433 --> 37:51.226
There's no child
because I'm still pregnant.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.735
I've been pregnant
for the last 15 months.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.162
I don't understand. How?

38:10.372 --> 38:14.166
I was already pregnant
when I received Julia's spinal fluid.

38:14.626 --> 38:18.587
I became immortal and stopped aging,
and so did the fetus.

38:18.797 --> 38:19.838
Jesus.

38:20.048 --> 38:24.385
I thought my pregnant girlfriends were
exaggerating about the first trimester.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.221
But...

38:27.931 --> 38:31.517
...after 15 months of fatigue...

38:31.726 --> 38:35.396
...and morning sickness
and nosebleeds....

38:38.483 --> 38:41.860
You know, I thought about terminating...

38:42.988 --> 38:45.447
...and I probably should have...

38:46.866 --> 38:49.159
...but something always stopped me.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.373
So...

38:56.418 --> 38:58.168
...here we are.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.268
I wanna help.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.478
I do, but....

39:18.732 --> 39:22.526
But I can't.
You have to leave here now.

39:23.570 --> 39:26.780
For your safety and the baby's.

39:29.325 --> 39:33.287
No. I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me why you're here.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.957
I can't.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.002
What I have to do is too important.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.703
Don't be afraid, Soren.

40:15.622 --> 40:18.624
What's wrong? Is my mom okay?

40:18.833 --> 40:21.293
Better than okay.
She wants to see you.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.087
Really?

40:25.090 --> 40:26.715
But what about curfew?

40:27.467 --> 40:30.928
It's okay. Just this one time.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.485
My mom's outside the wall?

40:48.029 --> 40:50.280
She'll be here in a minute.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.451
You hear that?

40:55.912 --> 40:59.164
-That was her.
-Are you sure?

40:59.374 --> 41:00.666
More than sure.

41:03.169 --> 41:06.463
It's okay. I promise.

41:16.224 --> 41:17.599
Landry.

41:18.935 --> 41:21.520
Landry, what are you doing?

41:31.531 --> 41:33.031
Hello.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.160
No!
