Don't hurt Mommy. <i>Incendium!</i>

00:06.859 --> 00:07.925
- No, no, no.
- Shh.

00:07.927 --> 00:09.660
You could really hurt somebody.

00:09.662 --> 00:11.582
I don't know what's going
on. I can't control it.

BONNIE: <i>I gave him the cure.</i>

00:17.269 --> 00:19.158
Are you gonna teach
me how to contact Enzo?

00:19.161 --> 00:20.370
I'm going to give you an understanding

00:20.372 --> 00:21.305
of what you've become.

00:21.307 --> 00:23.955
I want you to remember
the moment of Enzo's death.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.008
[Screaming]

00:25.010 --> 00:26.410
When Enzo died, you screamed.

00:26.412 --> 00:29.046
A powerful psychic blast
created an entire world,

00:29.048 --> 00:30.948

00:30.950 --> 00:33.717
Enzo, I thought I'd never see you again.

00:33.719 --> 00:35.719
You have to get away from Cade.

CAROLINE: Why don't you
give yourself a chance

00:37.602 --> 00:39.428
to discover who you are now?

00:39.431 --> 00:42.226
Because I think that means
leaving Mystic Falls... alone.

00:42.228 --> 00:43.727
If you want my forgiveness,

00:43.729 --> 00:45.763
you're gonna bring Elena
Gilbert back to life.

Kai siphoned me like a juice box.

01:41.919 --> 01:44.420
Why are you here?

01:44.422 --> 01:46.188
I want the ashen dagger.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.690
The one weapon that can kill me.

01:47.692 --> 01:49.058
Well, you're out of luck,

01:49.060 --> 01:50.426

I wasn't your errand boy anymore.

- Go for it.

talk me out of leaving town,

- It didn't end well.
- What are you talking about?

- Kai's dead.
- Ish. He's alive enough

04:13.037 --> 04:15.304
to screw me over, and
kidnap Elena's coffin.

04:15.306 --> 04:18.240
- Then he turned her over to Cade.
- Apparently.

But Kai being Kai, he
tried to cheat the devil.
