00:37.704 --> 00:39.413
Mr. Danielson?

00:40.498 --> 00:41.999
He took my blanket!

00:42.083 --> 00:43.375
Okay. Everybody calm down!
Calm down, everybody.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.835
You'll get your blanket!

00:50.008 --> 00:53.010
lt's mine! Legally, it's mine! lt's mine!

00:54.971 --> 00:56.889
Nice, Evan. Really nice.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.349
Evan, get help. Get help!

00:59.434 --> 01:01.351
l don't need help!
What l need is my blanket!

01:01.436 --> 01:04.938
-Man, you're crazy!
-l am not crazy! l want my goo-gaa!

01:05.940 --> 01:07.900
l want my goo-gaa!

01:07.984 --> 01:09.818
He wasn't always this way.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.906
Once upon a time, he was a king.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.328
The king of Somewhere.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.038
Strong and powerful.

01:21.122 --> 01:22.247
What l'm suggesting is that

01:22.332 --> 01:24.708
you reallocate 8% of your equity
into international markets.

01:25.335 --> 01:29.379
He protected his loyal subjects
and made them feel safe.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.048
All right, are you looking at the charts?

01:31.132 --> 01:34.718
Well, these are actually very
conservative projections. Yes they are.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.137
But one day he left his Kingdom

01:37.222 --> 01:40.808
and he got lost in the Land of Nowhere.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.519
Something no one could
have ever imagined.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.038
Everybody's upped their stocks...

02:03.665 --> 02:07.292
I am here to taIk about finances,
Wall Street...

02:24.727 --> 02:27.855
In Nowhere Land,
everybody wanted to be king,

02:27.939 --> 02:30.941
or at Ieast they aII try to be.

02:31.025 --> 02:33.026
Evan, it's Noah. I got a feather.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.528
-You got a what?
-A feather.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.155
lt was on my desk with a note attached.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.573
-From Johnny Whitefeather?
-Yup.

02:37.657 --> 02:38.657
What'd the note say?

02:38.741 --> 02:42.202
"l'll be at your 9:00 a.m. See you
in there. Ain't nothing but a thing."

02:42.287 --> 02:45.622
-Wow. Then the rumor must be true.
-What? What rumor?

02:45.707 --> 02:47.166
-Stevens is cashing in.
-What?

02:47.250 --> 02:49.334
-He's selling the company?
-He has to be.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.628
His repIacement is gonna be me
or Johnny!

02:51.713 --> 02:52.796
You're gonna get this job!

02:55.091 --> 02:57.134
-Hey. Good morning!
-Good morning, Mr. Danielson.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.178
-Good morning!
-Good morning, Mr. Danielson.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.804
It was a very strange pIace.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.681
...and they've narrowed it down
to our firm and two others.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.392
And it is confirmed, Whitefeather is
gonna be in the meeting.

03:05.476 --> 03:09.188
The King was reaIIy unhappy there.
He just couIdn't figure out why.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.981
-Hey, Tod!
-What's up, Mr. D?

03:11.065 --> 03:12.983
Take this down to graphics
and add it to my chart, all right?

03:13.067 --> 03:14.693
-After l...
-Now.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.654
-What about the...
-Hey, "now" now, man. What's up?

03:17.739 --> 03:20.032
-How much are we paying that guy?
-He's an unpaid intern.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.075
lt might be too much.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.413
l think it was because he was
aIways working to protect his castIe

03:26.497 --> 03:29.416
from those who wanted
to steal his crown.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.418
Johnny Whitefeather.

03:31.502 --> 03:35.130
Evan Danielson.
Fellow salmon swimming upstream.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.091
-After you, sir.
-Thank you.

03:38.635 --> 03:44.223
So those of us he left behind
went out into the land to rescue him.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.854
Whip, l said l'd sit you down with
our two best financial managers.

03:50.939 --> 03:55.234
Evan's been our number-one guy
for the last eight and a half years.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.027
Johnny's been with us for 1 6 months,

03:57.111 --> 04:00.030
but he's already
one of our top producers.

04:00.114 --> 04:03.659
Either way, you'll be well taken care of
here at Smith/Stevens.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.328
-Evan?
-Mr. Bryson.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.746
You've made some
really sound investments,

04:07.830 --> 04:10.874
but quite frankly, l think we can do
better. Let's see if you agree.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.087
Evan Danielson's office.

04:15.171 --> 04:20.175
Now, this will give you a solid base of
capital and a 9 to 1 1 % yield, annually.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.470
Yeah, l understand. ls it...
His daughter?

04:24.180 --> 04:25.514
Did you call her mother?

04:26.641 --> 04:29.768
Because if l say it's urgent
and he's really, really...

04:32.188 --> 04:33.272
The goo-gaa?

04:33.356 --> 04:36.191
-Fantastic, Evan.
-Thank you, Tom.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.152
-Johnny?
-Thank you, Tom. Whip.

04:39.862 --> 04:43.407
Dave, Lee, Troy.
l see those looks of skepticism,

04:43.491 --> 04:46.410
just like old man Stevens
the first week that he hired me.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.955
Said to himself, "l hired an lndian.
Can he handle money?"

04:50.039 --> 04:51.540
And how.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.798
Hey, l really appreciate
you letting me contribute

04:59.882 --> 05:02.426
a little piece of venison to your potlatch.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.136
Okay.

05:05.513 --> 05:06.888
We're here under one sky.

05:06.973 --> 05:11.226
All of us, under one sky.
Let's appreciate that.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.603
One sky.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.817
Evan Danielson,
that man over there is a seer.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.694
Uses the whole eye.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.614
But there is a difference between sight

05:26.701 --> 05:28.243
and vision.

05:30.413 --> 05:34.082
Sight is about
what lies just in front of us.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.795
Vision is about what lies ahead.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.548
-The genius of the hawk...
-Excuse me.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.091
Johnny, sorry to interrupt you

05:43.176 --> 05:45.469
in one of your always interesting stories
about nature,

05:45.553 --> 05:48.055
but, gentlemen, l have...
l'm gonna have to leave you, Mr. Bryson,

05:48.139 --> 05:51.350
in the very capable hands of
my colleague Mr. Noah Kulick here.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.394
l have a little family emergency at my
daughter's school l have to take care of.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.812
Thank you for your time, sir.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.647
That's what we're all talking about.

05:57.732 --> 06:01.818
Life, nest, eggs. Circle of life.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.404
Yeah. Hakuna matata.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.115
l'm so sorry, but the school kept calling.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.867
-Don't tell me. The goo-gaa.
-Yeah.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.285
l hate that blanket!

06:11.371 --> 06:15.040
We don't normally allow
any kind of security items at school,

06:15.124 --> 06:17.376
but because of yours
and Trish's separation,

06:17.460 --> 06:19.086
we made a temporary exception.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.631
Unfortunately,
it's just not workable anymore.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.966
Hey, you guys.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.218
So this is why l was called out of work?

06:26.302 --> 06:28.136
Because my daughter's
sitting by herself at recess?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.514
No, the reason l called you,
Mr. Danielson,

06:30.598 --> 06:33.183
is because her class went inside
45 minutes ago.

06:33.267 --> 06:37.229
She's still sitting here because
Kupida and Mopida told her to.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.899
-Kupida and Mopida are...
-Yeah. l know. Her imaginary friends.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.194
l told Trish we're gonna have to
do something about that blanket.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.362
Well, Trish and l discussed this,

06:45.446 --> 06:47.197
and we both feel that
what needs to be dealt with

06:47.281 --> 06:50.909
is the reason why she still feels
she needs a blanket.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.787
lt's usually an indication of
some kind of emotional needs

06:53.871 --> 06:55.455
that haven't been met.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.667
What's happening? Are they talking?

06:59.043 --> 07:01.002
Well, you know, sometimes,
these things are like a Band-Aid.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.587
You just have to rip it off.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.090
Right.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.426
Rip it.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.511
Rip.

07:14.851 --> 07:18.270
Kupida. l can't hear you both
at the same time.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.188
Go ahead, Mopida.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.859
Wait. Wait a minute.
Someone's coming.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.114
Hey, Liv.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.783
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hey, baby.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.870
Hey, remember we talked about
how the day was gonna come

07:34.954 --> 07:37.497
when you couldn't take the goo-gaa
to school with you anymore?

07:37.582 --> 07:39.124
That day is gonna be today.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.376
So what Daddy's gonna do
is l'm gonna take the goo-gaa.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.544
l'm gonna hold on to it for you.

07:42.628 --> 07:46.298
When you get home from school,
you'll get it back then, all right?

07:46.382 --> 07:48.633
All right, sweetie.
Just give me the goo-gaa.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.386
And you have a great day.
All right, baby.

08:11.115 --> 08:13.408
As you know,
the Mile High City Arts Council

08:13.493 --> 08:15.911
relies solely on contributions.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.957
Yeah. l've got 1 2 people and four desks.
We need your money.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.546
Mr. Cosgrove, can l call you right back?

08:26.923 --> 08:29.633
Trish, please, this is a really bad week.

08:29.717 --> 08:33.220
Evan, l told you three months ago
that this week was pledge week.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.971
-That's this week?
-Yes.

08:35.056 --> 08:38.265
You promised me you wouldn't do this.
You promised me.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.019
Look, Evan,
l know you and her haven't ever...

08:41.102 --> 08:42.437
-Trish, please, not this week.
-...had a chance...

08:42.522 --> 08:43.938
-Not this week. l'm begging you.
-...to connect.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.732
-Can we flip-flop and l'll do it next week?
-No!

08:45.816 --> 08:46.983
-l promise you...
-No.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.569
Evan, even if l could, l wouldn't.

08:55.826 --> 08:59.246
Evan, why did you tell me
you even wanted to have children?

08:59.789 --> 09:02.207
'Cause l did. l do!

09:04.502 --> 09:06.962
l just didn't know l'd be so bad at it.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.966
You know, Evan,
you're a really smart guy.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.468
You make huge deals every day.

09:14.136 --> 09:17.764
l'm sure you'll find a way
to deal with her.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.729
Sweetie, you're gonna go
with Daddy, okay?

09:24.814 --> 09:27.190
-Okay.
-He's so excited.

09:28.025 --> 09:31.653
And l'm gonna call you every night
to say good night.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.738
-Promise?
-You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

09:33.823 --> 09:34.948
-Okay.
-l love you, kiddo.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.366
l love you, too.

09:51.173 --> 09:52.882
Okay, here we go.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.928
Hey, you're a competitive guy.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.764
That's intimidating,
especially in a father figure.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.350
Okay, first of all,
l'm not her father figure.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.312
l'm her father.
And she's the one that's intimidating.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.772
-What?
-Honestly. She just stares at me!

10:07.857 --> 10:08.940
Or through me.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.776
She's got this imaginary world
that she goes to

10:11.861 --> 10:15.905
with Kupida and Kapuda and Zupida.
l don't get it.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.575
Look, l'm gonna put this
as gently as possible, okay?

10:18.659 --> 10:19.909
You're a complete idiot.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.787
You feel out of control
and you project that onto her.

10:22.872 --> 10:26.416
Hey, look, man.
Be my friend and be my client.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.169
But don't be Mr. Mystic Man
or whatever that is you call yourself.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.712
-Man Whisperer.
-The Man Whisperer.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.673
John Strother, former cornerback
for the Denver Broncos,

10:33.758 --> 10:35.884
is now known as the "Man Whisperer."

10:35.968 --> 10:38.303
-That's right.
-You be whispering to men.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.973
Look, all l'm saying is that
we all have a little kid inside, right here.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.642
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And he's whispering.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.435
Stop. Please. Stop. Stop!

10:45.519 --> 10:46.519
lf you don't whisper to little Evan,

10:46.604 --> 10:48.938
-you'll never get through to Olivia!
-l'm not whispering to little Evan

10:49.023 --> 10:50.148
-and l'm not whispering with you.
-You just did.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.691
No, l wasn't.
No, l wasn't whispering with you.

10:51.776 --> 10:52.817
l was whispering on the other...

10:52.902 --> 10:54.694
You was finished talking,
and then l said "whisper" after.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.820
l wasn't whispering with you.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.113
Little Evan?
What's wrong with little Evan?

10:57.198 --> 11:00.075
Say it again. Say, "Whisper to little
Evan," one more time. Say it again.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.785
-You know what's gonna happen?
-What's gonna happen? What?

11:01.869 --> 11:04.496
-What you gonna do?
-l'm gonna crash your portfolio.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.498
What's that have to do with anything?

11:13.381 --> 11:15.757
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.635
-You wear him out?
-No, but Olivia will.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.971
-Where are they at?
-Upstairs. Princess dress-up.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.015
What? They started without me?

11:25.101 --> 11:28.353
-Hey, Ev. Livvy's upstairs.
-Thanks. Thanks for watching her.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.271
Absolutely. Anytime.

11:30.356 --> 11:34.150
And Trish told me to remind you,
vaccinations on Thursday.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.945
-Okay.
-And Ella's party is Friday.

11:37.029 --> 11:40.031
lt's a sleepover here,
so pack all of her stuff.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.033
And the Fall Sing is Saturday.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.036
Livvy's really nervous,
so go through her songs with her.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.163
She doesn't think l'm gonna
remember all this, does she?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.957
No. She does not.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.881
Oh, no. Come on, guys.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.968
More! l want to be beautiful!

12:00.052 --> 12:01.386
Hey, Ev.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.054
l've got the perfect size seat
for little Evan.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.223
-Come, sit down.
-l think l'm fine. l'm okay.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.392
Come on, Liv, let's go. We gotta go.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.812
-Bye, Olivia.
-Bye, Ella.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.272
-Bye, Liv.
-Bye.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.065
Denver Broncos, huh?

12:19.822 --> 12:21.990
No, Mopida, l can't go.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.909
No.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.828
Well, yeah.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.003
Are you sure, Mopida?

12:38.674 --> 12:40.717
Okay, if you say so.

12:45.639 --> 12:48.641
What? He actually had a snake?
A real snake?

12:49.351 --> 12:51.019
Nobody's going to fall
for this whole shtick.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.189
What we have to do is find a better way
to do this, all right?

12:54.690 --> 12:55.732
No, no, listen.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.526
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna eliminate TriTek.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.153
No, no, no, no.
Look, l'm looking at the specs here,

13:00.237 --> 13:02.572
and l don't like what l see. First of...

13:04.867 --> 13:06.451
Hold on a second.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.787
Olivia, what are you doing?
Go back to bed.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.415
-You said you'd be a king.
-l said l'd do what?

13:12.500 --> 13:17.378
You said last time that next time
you'd do dress up, and you'd be a king.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.380
Well, l don't recall saying that.
l don't remember saying that.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.632
And even if l did say that,

13:20.716 --> 13:22.675
l don't have the right stuff
to do king stuff here.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.303
l don't have any king clothes,
and l don't have a king hat.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.971
lt's called a crown.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.598
-Evan, you there?
-Hold on a second.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.391
Whatever. Olivia, please, just go to bed.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.559
l will sleep in here.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.937
No, you're sleeping in your room.
That's why you have a bedroom.

13:34.021 --> 13:37.315
-You go sleep in your bedroom.
-l do not want to sleep in there.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.736
All right. You're gonna go to sleep?
You promise?

13:42.613 --> 13:46.491
Go over there and lay down. Be quiet,
Olivia. l have to work here, all right?

13:47.493 --> 13:49.577
l'm sorry, man. Where was l?
What was l saying?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.955
Listen, this is where
we're gonna snake Whitefeather.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.249
'Cause he's thinking we're gonna go
for the obvious play, Solocom.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.794
But what we're gonna do... Digital Fiber.
Digital Fiber is the play.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.129
-That's the obvious choice.
-Stop saying...

14:00.214 --> 14:01.548
Hold on a second.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.633
-Olivia.
-What?

14:05.469 --> 14:08.596
Yeah, sorry about that, man. Look.
No, no, no.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.099
You gotta be quiet.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.768
lt's his job, not yours.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.814
Can l call you back? Thank you.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.276
All right, that's it.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.237
Now, l asked you to be quiet,
but you don't listen.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.155
-Yes, l do.
-No, you don't.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.032
l asked you not to talk,
but you kept talking.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.326
You don't know how to listen,
so since you don't know how to listen,

14:30.411 --> 14:32.745
you take your blanket
and you go in your room. Go.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.792
Come on now.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.460
Come on, come on, really, please.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.505
Come on, please. l'm saying, "Please."
Go to bed, please.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.934
Now what?

14:55.978 --> 14:57.478
What is it?

14:59.273 --> 15:02.817
Look, l told you,
l will play king with you some other time.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.486
Daddy has a lot of work to do.
All right? So...

15:07.865 --> 15:09.115
What?

15:10.200 --> 15:11.826
l do listen.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.573
l'm sorry.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.993
How many days till l go back home?

16:01.794 --> 16:04.712
I've gone over everything we taIked
about Iast night, and it aII Iooks great.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.965
That's perfect, because
Whitefeather's gonna go with Solocom.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.800
-Of course.
-But we got a better alternative.

16:08.884 --> 16:09.968
-Digital Fiber.
-Got a good record.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.386
Exactly.
l'm gonna call you in 20 minutes,

16:11.470 --> 16:12.971
-right after l drop Olivia off to school.
-Very nice.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.430
All right. Okay.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.516
Come on, honey. Let's get going.
Daddy's sort of in a hurry.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.309
l think this milk is spoiled.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.311
No. That's not possible,
because l checked this milk.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.647
Come on, let's go! Let's go.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.003
What if we say
we just get a muffin, huh?

16:45.087 --> 16:47.338
Tomorrow, can we make pancakes?

16:47.423 --> 16:49.173
Honey, l don't know
if l have the right stuff for that,

16:49.258 --> 16:51.926
-you know, supply-wise or skill-wise.
-l can help you.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.845
l got a better idea.
How about we leave a note for Graciella,

16:53.929 --> 16:55.388
she can make some pancakes,
put them in the freezer,

16:55.472 --> 16:57.473
we'll thaw them out
and eat them tomorrow, huh? Yeah.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.435
-Not what l was thinking.
-Move! Let's move!

17:00.519 --> 17:03.730
Hey, you didn't pack my Fall Sing music.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.733
Okay, your Fall Sing...
Where is that stuff?

17:07.818 --> 17:10.778
Okay, here it is! Right here.
Right here's your music.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.824
Rick?

17:14.907 --> 17:18.953
-l thought you said you were in a hurry.
-Yeah. l'm coming right now.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.252
Okay, stop, stop, stop. Once is enough.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.676
Hey, does Mommy ever make
a new friend, you know, in like a...

17:33.761 --> 17:35.803
-You mean Rick?
-Yes, Rick.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.557
ls that the guy from Mommy's work with
the spiked hair and the pointed face?

17:39.641 --> 17:42.727
"Hello, l'd like to talk to you for a sec."
That guy?

17:42.811 --> 17:45.813
No, that's Skip. Rick is tall.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.983
Handsome, too.
He looks like Prince Charming.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.111
Good for Rick.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.615
-Morning, Graciella.
-Morning, Mr. Danielson.

17:55.699 --> 17:58.242
-Hi, Graciella.
-Hi, Olivia. Nice to see you.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.078
Hey, Graciella! One thing.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.663
Can you please make some pancakes
and put them in the freezer for us?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.625
Thank you so much. All right.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.752
Hey, what are you, a button maniac?
Stop it.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.003
Press one floor and leave it alone.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.963
Daddy?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.342
Kupida wanted me to tell you something.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.052
Yeah. Go ahead.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.847
She heard what you were saying
on the phone last night,

18:20.390 --> 18:23.601
and she told me to tell you
she doesn't like either of them.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.728
Which guy? Rick or Skip?

18:25.813 --> 18:29.649
The companies,
Solocom and Digital Fiber.

18:29.733 --> 18:34.403
Kupida doesn't like them,
neither does Mopida, and Qwali agrees.

18:35.405 --> 18:38.574
Daddy, do you know
why they don't like them?

18:39.201 --> 18:41.828
Daddy, l said,
do you know why they don't like them?

18:41.912 --> 18:44.205
-Why?
-Because they're broken.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.875
-Do you know which one they do like?
-No, honey, l have no idea.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.878
The first one,
the one you threw away, TriTek.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.506
-Are you sure you're listening?
-Yes, Daddy sure is listening,

18:53.590 --> 18:55.508
but come on, we got to go. Let's go.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.053
Kupida and Mopida really like it.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.222
-You know why?
-Why is that?

19:01.306 --> 19:05.309
-Because it has buried treasure.
-Yeah? Okay.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.396
-You aren't listening.
-No, no, Daddy's listening.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.404
Okay, so, we're here,
and we're going in.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.073
And there's something
you have to go without.

19:44.766 --> 19:48.269
Hey, come on, come on,
Olivia, let's go, let's go.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.523
-Liv! How are you?
-Hi!

19:52.608 --> 19:55.193
-Give me five.
-Put her there. Put her there.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.986
Okay, guys, l got, like,
three meetings back to back.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.572
She's just gonna sit down here
and get settled down here.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.199
Let's get settled in. All right.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.326
-Mike, which one can l get rid of?
-Well...

20:03.410 --> 20:04.535
That one.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.204
No. You don't say that one.
That's sacrilege.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.623
That's Dante D'Enzo.
We never get rid of Dante D'Enzo.

20:08.707 --> 20:12.251
-Kupida says he's boring.
-Well, Kupida is estÃºpida.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.962
Because he happens to be one of
the greatest investors on the planet.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.756
-No, he's boring.
-No, no.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.382
Why am l standing here
arguing with you about Kupida?

20:18.467 --> 20:20.468
Let me get something for you to watch.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.387
There you go. There's the...
What's that? Barney.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.973
Okay, look, can you watch my kid for
me? You have my back for me, Mike?

20:26.058 --> 20:27.808
Watch that Barney and l'll be...

20:29.853 --> 20:32.146
That's not Barney. That's Blue.

20:32.898 --> 20:36.234
And now I'm going to tap your knee
very gentIy...

20:36.318 --> 20:37.652
Did you see that?

20:37.736 --> 20:40.696
...by increasing your family's holdings
in optical fiber.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.532
lf you take a look at these charts here
on page six in your folders...

20:52.167 --> 20:54.085
Granted, Solocom looks solid,

20:54.169 --> 20:57.046
but if you pore over the financials,
it's crystal clear,

20:57.130 --> 20:59.674
the smart play here is Digital Fiber.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.969
-Kupida says no.
-Okay.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.429
-No.
-Let's move on Digital Fiber.

21:05.514 --> 21:08.182
l'm sorry. Don't move on Digital Fiber?

21:08.267 --> 21:11.435
Oh, no. Yes, yes. Do go, yes. No.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.438
-No?
-Yes. Yes, go, yes.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.904
-Mother?
-Tom?

21:22.572 --> 21:25.449
Johnny?
Perhaps you have something to add?

21:25.534 --> 21:30.121
Not really. lt's good work from Evan.
Digital Fiber. Solocom.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.872
l struggled with it myself last night.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.083
l went to sleep convinced
l was gonna take

21:34.167 --> 21:38.379
the Pressman family towards
that pretty face, Solocom.

21:38.463 --> 21:42.675
But in the middle of the night,
the dream sparrow comes to me.

21:42.759 --> 21:46.304
She taps me on the forehead and says,
"Wake up, handsome brave.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.473
"There's something happening
in Uzbekistan."

21:49.558 --> 21:50.891
"Uzbeka-what?

21:50.976 --> 21:54.437
"lt's 4:30 in the morning, little friend.
l'm sleeping."

21:54.521 --> 21:59.483
But she said there's a kalacampi,
the worm hidden in the apple.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.029
And l let the dream sparrow fly away.

22:03.363 --> 22:06.157
-The dream sparrow.
-But l investigated what she said

22:06.241 --> 22:09.910
on the white fire grid
you people call the lnternet.

22:10.537 --> 22:13.205
At 4:1 5 this morning,
Mountain Standard Time,

22:13.290 --> 22:16.667
the Uzbeki government
followed through on a series of threats

22:16.752 --> 22:19.420
to detonate a nuclear weapon. Boom.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.506
Digital Fiber, Solocom,

22:22.591 --> 22:26.927
all of their underground cabling
that they were relying upon,

22:27.012 --> 22:30.890
lost in that mushroom cloud.
Do l blame Uzbekistan? No.

22:30.974 --> 22:34.060
Defend yourself, mountain republic,
just like you said you would.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.561
You followed through.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.025
But 200 miles south, in Turkmenistan,

22:41.109 --> 22:45.821
a little company called TriTek,
didn't look like much to me yesterday,

22:45.906 --> 22:51.327
but today, their 6,000 miles of
already-buried underground cabling,

22:51.411 --> 22:56.749
looking a lot more valuable.
TriTek, baby. l say we go into TriTek.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.044
-Let's keep our fingers crossed, huh?
-Okay.

23:02.631 --> 23:06.050
Evan, you mind if l sit in on your 1 1 :00?

23:06.134 --> 23:09.387
Well, Johnny, that's not up to me.
That's up to the client.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.679
So it's cool?

23:10.764 --> 23:13.724
Because l checked with the client,
and they said it's okay.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.018
That's great. That's great.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.813
Hey, ain't nothing but a thing.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.565
The herd moves on,
but you're going to be fine, little elk.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.568
You're going to be just fine.
One sky, man.

23:29.032 --> 23:32.785
One sky.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.580
l didn't realize you guys were so tight.

23:36.665 --> 23:37.873
You know what l want you to do
for me, Tod?

23:37.958 --> 23:40.418
Go down to legal
and check something out for me. Okay?

23:40.502 --> 23:41.919
l want to know
what the ramifications are

23:42.003 --> 23:44.547
if l were to stab Johnny Whitefeather.

23:50.178 --> 23:52.263
-Daddy!
-Not now, sweetie.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.098
-But, Daddy!
-Hey, not now.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.350
And listen to me, Liv.
This is where Daddy works.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.185
You cannot come down here
and stand outside my meetings

23:58.270 --> 23:59.854
and flail your arms around.

24:01.022 --> 24:04.150
-Rose!
-Yeah.

24:04.234 --> 24:07.945
Can you take Olivia downstairs
and get her a muffin or something?

24:08.029 --> 24:09.655
-Are you hungry, honey?
-No.

24:09.739 --> 24:11.198
l don't think she's hungry.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.826
She's starving. l can see that.

24:13.910 --> 24:16.120
Come on. Here we go.
Let's go get a muffin.

24:16.204 --> 24:18.038
Have some girl talk.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.296
-Hey, Ev.
-Hey, give me a second, Noah.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.965
l'm trying to find my notes for the 1 1 :00.

24:28.049 --> 24:32.636
Actually, it pertains to the 1 1 :00.
Quickly, two things.

24:32.721 --> 24:37.057
First, Johnny has just asked me
to join his tribe.

24:38.768 --> 24:42.313
l can't believe it.
He actually calls his team a tribe.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.732
Yeah, it's stupid.

24:46.234 --> 24:49.987
-And you said yes, didn't you?
-No, no, absolutely not, at first.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.822
But then he put
so much pressure on me.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.991
He needed an answer immediately. So...

24:54.075 --> 24:57.328
lt's all well and good, Noah.
But thanks for your loyalty, all right.

24:57.412 --> 25:00.331
Now if you don't mind, l gotta get ready
in about 1 0 minutes, so if you'd be so...

25:00.415 --> 25:04.418
That's the other thing.
About the 1 1 :00, Johnny moved it up.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.086
He had a conflict at 1 1 :00.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.506
Johnny moved my meeting
with my clients?

25:08.590 --> 25:10.716
Yeah. lt started at 1 0:30,

25:10.800 --> 25:15.721
so l popped in here as a courtesy to you,
because we were so tight for so long.

25:15.805 --> 25:18.557
And thank you so much for hiring me.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.768
-Out!
-Okay, l gotta go.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.604
Rose!

25:25.774 --> 25:27.983
Where are my notes for the 1 1 :00?

25:28.068 --> 25:30.819
-Sorry. l think they're in there.
-They're not in there.

25:36.952 --> 25:41.914
Mr. D, l talked to the lawyer guy upstairs
and he confirmed my hunch

25:42.457 --> 25:46.293
about the whole stabbing
Mr. Whitefeather thing.

25:47.045 --> 25:50.798
lt's a definite no-can-do
from a legal standpoint.

25:51.424 --> 25:55.511
-Go away, Tod. Go very far away.
-Yes. Right.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.350
l can't find them.

26:01.434 --> 26:02.685
Well, they're here somewhere, Rose.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.270
Please, l can't make it happen
without my notes.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.063
-Find my notes. Please.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.983
All of a sudden, l'm late for a meeting
that l was early for in the first place.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.443
All right. lt's all right.
We're gonna find them.

26:13.613 --> 26:19.660
Oh, my God.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.912
Did you draw on my worksheets?

26:21.997 --> 26:25.082
-Qwali said l could.
-Qwali said you could?

26:25.166 --> 26:27.084
Qwali said you could.
But let me tell you something, Olivia.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.877
l'm getting ready to go into
a meeting with grown people.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.170
They're gonna be judging Daddy,

26:30.255 --> 26:32.006
and all of a sudden,
my worksheets have

26:32.090 --> 26:35.009
pictures of flowers and sparkly stuff

26:35.093 --> 26:37.595
and, what is this,
people kissing or something?

26:37.679 --> 26:39.346
Kupida says they might get married.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.558
And why is this sticky?
Why is this so sticky?

26:42.642 --> 26:45.019
lt's sparkle glue. Sparkly.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.604
This is a disaster.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.540
-A horror show.
-Live.

27:06.958 --> 27:10.711
Love. Laugh. Walahala!

27:10.795 --> 27:15.633
Live. Love. Laugh. Walahala!

27:18.178 --> 27:21.138
l have never, guys,
l have never felt so jazzed

27:21.222 --> 27:25.976
about the prospects of our pension fund!
l mean it. l am jazzed!

27:26.061 --> 27:27.936
l wish l could take credit, Fred,

27:28.021 --> 27:31.315
but we gotta give that to the Walahala,
Mr. Waterfall.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.734
Hey, rain down prosperity!

27:34.527 --> 27:37.571
-And how.
-Thank you, Johnny!

27:42.786 --> 27:47.206
Evan. Everybody,
you remember Evan Danielson.

27:47.290 --> 27:50.501
l would hope so, after seven years
of working with you guys.

27:50.585 --> 27:53.879
Yeah. Of course.
How's it going there, Evan?

27:53.963 --> 27:56.715
Good to see you.
Hey, look, while we were waiting for you,

27:56.800 --> 28:01.804
Mr. Whitefeather, he made some rather
radical suggestions, as you can see.

28:02.555 --> 28:03.514
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:03.598 --> 28:07.476
So what do you think, Evan?
You agree with Mr. Whitefeather here,

28:07.560 --> 28:12.690
or do you have some special insight
that you'd like to share with us about

28:12.774 --> 28:14.858
how you would increase the fund?

28:15.902 --> 28:19.530
l think l do have some insight.
l don't agree with Mr. Whitefeather.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.578
What l was going to suggest was

28:26.663 --> 28:30.874
a 4% reallocation
away from convertible arbitrage.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.796
And in addition

28:40.468 --> 28:42.386
to that...

28:42.470 --> 28:44.680
Okay. Good. Thank you.

28:45.640 --> 28:49.059
l don't know about you guys,
but this is good for me.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.477
Didn't l tell you he was good?

28:50.562 --> 28:51.937
Hey, man.

28:52.021 --> 28:54.815
Sometimes the best spear
is the one you don't throw.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.400
Ain't nothing but a thing.

29:01.322 --> 29:03.907
"Ain't nothing but a thing."
What does that even mean, Johnny?

29:03.992 --> 29:07.077
lt's not a thing, but it is?
lt's something, but it's not a thing?

29:07.162 --> 29:11.749
But it's not. But it's something.
What is... l'm confused! What's that?

29:11.833 --> 29:15.085
You're a seeker, brother crow.
You should ride that...

29:15.170 --> 29:16.754
You know what? Stop it right now.
Stop it!

29:16.838 --> 29:17.963
Because l'm not going to be
subjected to your

29:18.047 --> 29:20.382
Dr. Seuss-meets-Pocahontas
stuff today.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.761
"One sky, two sky, red sky, blue sky!"

29:23.845 --> 29:27.473
Evan, that's shadow time. Okay.
Let's keep that in the shadows.

29:27.557 --> 29:30.601
Oh, no. Please, please, please,
make him stop. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

29:30.685 --> 29:34.480
Lord, Lord, Lord, make him stop, Lord.
Why are you falling for this?

29:34.564 --> 29:36.607
What's the matter? l've been
working for you for seven years.

29:36.691 --> 29:39.735
And you know that, Fred!
l went to your grandson's birthday party,

29:39.819 --> 29:42.029
and l went to Aspen with you
and your wife for the whole weekend.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.197
We got history together.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.699
You gonna throw it all away because
this guy showed you some waterfalls

29:45.784 --> 29:47.117
and got you chanting "Walla Walla"?

29:47.202 --> 29:50.788
Evan, we're always looking for fresh
ideas, and he showed us some.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.164
lt's like Johnny says.

29:52.248 --> 29:57.294
You got turtles that live in their shell
and turtles that live out of their shell.

29:57.378 --> 29:59.004
What? What? What did you just say?

29:59.088 --> 30:01.131
What did he say? Johnny just said...
What did he tell you?

30:01.216 --> 30:02.966
What was that?
What did he say? What?

30:03.051 --> 30:05.260
He said turtles with no shell...

30:05.345 --> 30:06.804
Called geckos, man.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.098
That's not even biology!

30:10.183 --> 30:13.685
How could you listen...
What's a frog, Johnny? A short snake?

30:13.770 --> 30:16.063
You want new ideas?
Special new ideas. Okay.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.732
'Cause slow, predictable growth
is so boring.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.068
Let's talk about... Let's talk about
a little company called ChemStar.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.403
Let's talk about this company.
l say go out and buy lots of it.

30:23.488 --> 30:27.241
Buy lots and lots of ChemStar.
You know why? Because it's sparkly.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.993
Everybody knows that
everybody loves sparkly things,

30:30.078 --> 30:33.163
so go out and buy some ChemStar
because it's sparkly!

30:33.248 --> 30:34.915
Okay. Here's fresh new idea
number two.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.543
These companies were so stinky
l had to snip them all away.

30:37.627 --> 30:40.671
Snip! Snip! Snip!
lf you're not good, you got to go!

30:40.755 --> 30:43.131
Okay.
Here's fresh new idea number three!

30:43.216 --> 30:45.259
Look at that.
You got YellowFin and AeroDyne.

30:45.343 --> 30:48.220
What are they doing?
YellowFin and AeroDyne.

30:48.304 --> 30:51.598
They're kissing.
And what does kissing usually lead to?

30:54.060 --> 30:56.687
Marriage! They're getting married!

30:56.771 --> 31:02.109
YeIIowFin and AeroDyne sitting in a tree
K-l-S-S-l-N-G

31:02.193 --> 31:04.528
First comes Iove, come on
Then comes marriage...

31:04.612 --> 31:06.780
-Evan. Stop.
-No, don't stop me.

31:06.865 --> 31:11.618
l got more. l got more, Tom!
Fresh new idea number four. NeoDyne.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.078
NeoDyne,
that's your biggest holding, right?

31:13.162 --> 31:14.746
6% of your equity is in NeoDyne.

31:14.831 --> 31:17.040
You know what fresh new thinking has
to say about that company?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.709
Pull out! Pull out now. You know why?

31:18.793 --> 31:20.711
Because NeoDyne is about
to have his pants pulled down

31:20.795 --> 31:22.588
and have his underwear exposed.
Know what's in the underwear?

31:22.672 --> 31:24.172
-No.
-Poop.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.466
Poop is in the underwear.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.845
Poop. Nasty doo-doo. Stinky ca-ca.
So here's a recap.

31:29.929 --> 31:32.472
NeoDyne, pants pulled down,
butt exposed,

31:32.557 --> 31:34.850
poo-poo, doo-doo, stinky ca-ca. Okay?

31:34.934 --> 31:37.561
Those are my fresh new...
You take this. You hold on to it.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.605
So those are my new ideas.
Thank you so much!

31:39.689 --> 31:43.483
Raining down!
Fresh ideas and Walla Walla!

31:52.160 --> 31:55.913
-Did you tell them what Kupida said?
-Yeah. l sure did.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.415
Did they like it?

31:58.499 --> 32:00.959
l imagine it was
a lot of fun to watch, honey.

32:05.715 --> 32:08.842
Oh, God. What have l done?
What have l done?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.928
ls everything okay?

32:20.480 --> 32:21.813
Hey, Ev?

32:22.732 --> 32:25.525
Stevens wants to see you. Yeah.

32:48.508 --> 32:52.177
-He just kind of flipped out.
-He lost it, man. He lost it.

32:52.261 --> 32:55.347
Look, whatever you heard l said,
it's probably a lot worse.

32:55.431 --> 32:59.226
-l heard you said poop.
-Yeah, l said poop. Twice.

32:59.519 --> 33:00.686
Nice.

33:04.273 --> 33:05.983
l will be back in as much time

33:06.067 --> 33:08.777
as it officially takes to say,
"You're fired," all right?

33:29.215 --> 33:31.341
Evan, what...

33:31.884 --> 33:33.093
Tom, l don't know what...

33:33.177 --> 33:36.680
l'm still trying to process
what just happened in there.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.016
So am l, too. Really, Tom.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.685
How did you know
about all those things?

33:41.769 --> 33:46.273
Listen to me, Tom. There's... What?

33:46.357 --> 33:48.483
The two companies
you said were kissing.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.860
AeroDyne and YellowFin.

33:49.944 --> 33:52.696
-What did you mean by that?
-l just...

33:52.780 --> 33:55.449
My brother-in-law
sits on the board ofAeroDyne.

33:55.533 --> 33:59.536
For 1 8 months, they've been looking for
a partner to offset their overseas debt.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.039
Of the literally
700 companies considered,

34:02.123 --> 34:05.584
there's only one whose financials
actually made sense,

34:05.668 --> 34:07.169
and that's YellowFin.

34:07.253 --> 34:11.130
Now, how did you know
about this impending marriage?

34:12.467 --> 34:16.178
-l just...
-Kupida said they might get married.

34:16.262 --> 34:20.181
ChemStar.
You said to buy because it was sparkly.

34:20.683 --> 34:21.975
Yes?

34:22.851 --> 34:25.478
-Yeah, okay...
-A data-wire

34:26.230 --> 34:30.734
came in during the meeting.
During the meeting.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.695
"ChemStar finalizes plans to expand

34:33.780 --> 34:36.406
"bauxite excavation
in its New Guinea mine.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.367
"Stock up 1 8%."

34:40.036 --> 34:41.286
Bauxite.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.661
It's sparkIe gIue.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.081
-Sparkly.
-Sparkly.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.627
NeoDyne. You said to get out.
Do you remember why?

34:50.045 --> 34:51.963
-Do you?
-Yes.

34:52.047 --> 34:53.672
l wrote this down.

34:55.384 --> 34:59.554
"Because their pants
were coming down,

34:59.639 --> 35:01.723
"and everyone was going to see
their underwear,

35:01.808 --> 35:03.767
"which was filled with poop."

35:04.519 --> 35:05.811
Yeah, l remember that.

35:05.895 --> 35:10.148
Lunchtime today, they were exposed
by the SEC for corporate fraud.

35:10.608 --> 35:15.362
Pants pulled down.
And their books? Total poop!

35:16.531 --> 35:18.573
So l'm asking you again.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.409
How did you know all of this?

35:24.205 --> 35:28.208
-Are you insider trading?
-No. No, Tom. No way, never.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.793
Then what are you doing?

35:32.255 --> 35:34.464
Where are you getting this information?

35:38.219 --> 35:41.138
-So it's the goo-gaa?
-That's how l go there.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.764
What do you mean you go there?
Go where?

35:42.849 --> 35:45.475
-To where the princesses live.
-Right. The princesses.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.311
That's Kupida and Qwali
and all of them, right?

35:48.396 --> 35:49.646
Qwali's a queen.

35:49.730 --> 35:52.107
Kupida, Mopida and Sopida
are princesses.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.442
-Okay, got you.
-How many times do l have to tell you?

35:54.527 --> 35:57.445
Right. Right.
Okay, let me get this right now.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.907
Now, they tell you things
about companies?

36:05.955 --> 36:07.414
Well, you know what,
l got a couple of other companies

36:07.498 --> 36:09.666
l want you to ask them about.
Do you think they'll be up to that?

36:09.750 --> 36:11.251
You can do it yourself.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.672
l can ask them myself.
l can go there with you?

36:15.756 --> 36:17.591
Yes, it'll be fun.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.720
Okay.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.266
A little more room here.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.392
-Now, l do what now?
-Okay.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.810
-l take the goo-gaa.
-You hold it up to your face.

36:28.895 --> 36:32.189
-Hold it up to my face.
-And rub in little circles.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.609
-Okay, l'm doing it in little circles. Okay.
-Like this.

36:35.693 --> 36:39.279
Now you put it over your head, like this.

36:39.363 --> 36:40.780
Okay. Now what?

36:40.865 --> 36:45.702
And you kind of call them in your mind
while you spin around in circles.

36:45.786 --> 36:48.622
Okay. So l call to them in my mind
while l spin in a circle.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.791
-Yeah.
-Okay, l'm spinning. l'm spinning.

36:51.876 --> 36:55.337
Keep spinning. Keep spinning.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.550
l'm spinning around.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.969
Are you calling them in your mind?

37:03.054 --> 37:04.471
Yeah.

37:05.139 --> 37:08.016
Okay. So am l supposed to just
keep spinning and spinning around?

37:08.100 --> 37:10.685
'Cause l'm a tad bit nauseous now.

37:13.147 --> 37:15.232
Okay, we're there!

37:26.535 --> 37:28.495
lsn't it beautiful?

37:31.999 --> 37:36.127
Come on, Daddy!
This way, into the forest!

37:37.380 --> 37:40.048
Wow. The princesses
sure live in a beautiful forest.

37:40.132 --> 37:42.759
No, because this part's all burned.

37:42.843 --> 37:45.136
Yes, burned from a big forest fire.

37:45.221 --> 37:48.306
No, Sopida's dragon burnt it all.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.933
Sopida has a dragon?

37:50.017 --> 37:53.061
And if you want to get past her,
you have to sing a song she likes.

37:53.145 --> 37:55.563
l gotta sing a song
to Sopida's dragon, too?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.985
-Hurry. She's coming!
-What? She's coming where?

38:00.861 --> 38:02.112
Sing.

38:07.451 --> 38:11.538
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

38:11.622 --> 38:12.956
Sopida's dragon

38:13.040 --> 38:15.041
You gotta do better than that.

38:16.210 --> 38:22.966
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

38:23.050 --> 38:24.759
Try higher.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.763
Sopida's dragon, please let...

38:28.848 --> 38:31.558
-Higher, like a mouse!
-You want me to have an aneurysm?

38:31.642 --> 38:35.562
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

38:36.981 --> 38:38.523
She very hates that.

38:38.607 --> 38:41.484
-l'm with her.
-Try lower, like a frog.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.153
Okay, like a frog.

38:44.196 --> 38:47.991
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

38:48.075 --> 38:49.284
Sopida's dragon...

38:49.368 --> 38:52.662
She very likes that. She fell asleep.
Come on. Let's go.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.081
Now we can go through her cave. Duck!

38:55.166 --> 38:57.751
All right, going into the cave.
That's a big, beautiful cave we're in.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.544
No, it's tiny. Can't you see?

38:59.628 --> 39:01.671
Okay. My eyes are just adjusting still.
That's why...

39:01.756 --> 39:02.881
Jump, Daddy! Jump!

39:02.965 --> 39:05.300
-Jump? Why am l jumping? Okay.
-Jump till you get in!

39:05.384 --> 39:06.676
Okay, you're in.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.637
-Now you're out.
-Okay. What was l in?

39:09.722 --> 39:11.931
-France!
-l was in France?

39:12.433 --> 39:14.601
-Now, we're on the beach.
-Okay. We're on the beach now.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.520
All right. Great! ls it a nice beach here?

39:17.605 --> 39:20.190
Only 'cause mermaids give us
popcorn balls.

39:20.274 --> 39:24.569
That's so nice.
Thank you for the popcorn balls!

39:26.697 --> 39:30.784
Oh, no! Someone's coming!
Sopida, no! Sopida, you can't!

39:30.868 --> 39:32.202
Can't what? What happened?
What's going on?

39:32.286 --> 39:34.788
She doesn't trust you!
She's throwing rocks at you!

39:34.872 --> 39:36.373
-Why? Why...
-Duck, Daddy! Duck!

39:36.457 --> 39:37.749
l'm ducking! But what did Daddy do?

39:37.833 --> 39:39.709
Why's she throwing rocks at me?
Don't know what l did.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.294
Up the path!

39:42.129 --> 39:43.546
Go back down!

39:44.882 --> 39:46.591
-This way.
-Okay.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.303
Okay, we made it. There they are.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.431
Hi, Kupida! Hi, Mopida!

39:53.516 --> 39:55.934
-Hey.
-Say something nice.

39:56.018 --> 40:00.105
Hey, Kupida and Mopida, how are you?
Good to see you.

40:01.816 --> 40:05.068
My name is Evan Danielson,
and l'm Olivia's dad.

40:05.152 --> 40:07.612
They already know who you are.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.030
Okay.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.867
lt's good to see you.
You look so nice and pretty,

40:12.952 --> 40:16.663
the two of you.
My, you really outdid yourself today.

40:16.747 --> 40:20.166
l'm here to ask you. l was wondering...

40:21.961 --> 40:24.838
-Are you sure they're...
-Yeah. They're watching.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.508
l was gonna... l have some...

40:30.761 --> 40:34.931
l want to ask about magnesium futures

40:35.015 --> 40:38.893
and their relationship to
Bolivian currency fluctuations.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.150
Specifically, these three companies,

40:45.234 --> 40:49.612
La Paz Ore and lron,
and lnternational Mining

40:49.697 --> 40:52.699
and Weston Metallurgy Limited.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.034
Weston Metallurgy.

40:55.828 --> 40:59.622
These three. l was wondering if you...
Can they see them?

41:01.667 --> 41:03.334
l don't want to be in your way.

41:04.753 --> 41:05.962
Okay, what are they doing?
Are they talking?

41:06.046 --> 41:07.130
-Yeah.
-What are they talking about?

41:07.214 --> 41:08.548
They're talking.

41:14.638 --> 41:15.805
Really?

41:16.557 --> 41:18.224
Are you sure?

41:19.018 --> 41:20.185
Okay.

41:21.103 --> 41:22.937
Yes, no, no.

41:24.690 --> 41:25.732
Did they give a reason?

41:27.318 --> 41:31.613
-Because it's fancy?
-That's exactly right, sir. Fancy.

41:31.697 --> 41:34.532
But you're also saying, and this is what
strikes me as contradictory,

41:34.617 --> 41:37.160
that we should abandon all interests
in Weston Metallurgy.

41:37.244 --> 41:40.205
-That's correct.
-Because the boliviano is going to...

41:40.289 --> 41:41.498
What did he say again?

41:41.582 --> 41:44.501
"Be a big, dumb showoff
and fall off its bike."

41:44.585 --> 41:48.087
No. Trike.
And nobody likes a big, dumb showoff.

41:48.172 --> 41:50.173
Well, no offense, son,
but sounds to me like

41:50.257 --> 41:52.342
a load of what you just stepped in.

41:52.426 --> 41:55.011
Well, that's why we brought
Mr. Whitefeather along, right?

41:55.095 --> 41:56.095
What you got, son?

41:56.180 --> 41:58.681
Mr. Rowe, that's funny.

41:59.433 --> 42:04.062
The country's entire monetary system
reduced to riding around on a tricycle.

42:05.356 --> 42:09.192
That's a laugh. lt's good to laugh.
lt's good to laugh, man.

42:10.152 --> 42:12.737
But there's a time to be serious.

42:12.821 --> 42:16.574
We're out here in these holy mountains
that we call Rocky.

42:17.201 --> 42:20.119
They're full of predator, prey.

42:21.497 --> 42:25.124
The lion of the mountain
knows when to pounce.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.379
Better watch out, jack-bunny...

42:29.463 --> 42:32.215
-Excuse me, one moment.
-Yeah, okay.

42:38.889 --> 42:40.682
Love the new act, man.

42:40.766 --> 42:42.850
-Fun character.
-Thank you.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.144
You know, there's an old tribal saying,

42:45.229 --> 42:48.064
"lt's not the paint
that makes the warrior."

42:48.148 --> 42:51.526
-What?
-Be well, brother. Be well.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.863
Evan, l ever tell you
about Billy Littlesnake,

42:55.948 --> 42:58.074
a guy l used to go fishing with
in Montana?

42:58.158 --> 43:00.868
l think you spared me that story.

43:00.953 --> 43:02.829
He'd go fishing
where nobody else fished

43:02.913 --> 43:05.748
and always come back with 1 0 fat trout.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.668
Turned out he was stopping off
at the market and buying them.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.670
l'm not insider trading,
if that's what you're saying.

43:10.754 --> 43:14.257
Whoa, come on. Let's don't go into
those woods. All right?

43:14.341 --> 43:17.719
-There's a lot of bear in those woods.
-Hey, listen. Stop that thing.

43:17.803 --> 43:20.179
lf you're going to talk to me,
don't do that thing you do.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.473
You want me to speak directly?
l can do that.

43:22.558 --> 43:23.891
Then do it.

43:25.144 --> 43:27.353
You want to run with me, Evan,
then run with me.

43:27.438 --> 43:30.189
l accept the challenge. l welcome it.

43:30.274 --> 43:34.944
But if l find out that you're stopping off
at the market and buying your fat trout,

43:35.029 --> 43:36.154
l'm gonna scalp you.

43:36.238 --> 43:38.489
You're gonna scalp me. Literally?

43:38.574 --> 43:40.700
lt's gonna feel literal, yeah.

43:41.577 --> 43:43.536
Nice chatting with you, Johnny.

43:45.372 --> 43:46.748
And you, Evan.

43:46.832 --> 43:49.584
Hey, Ev, good to see you. Okay.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.504
Let me tell you something
about Johnny Whitefeather.

43:53.589 --> 43:56.758
Under all the show,
l'm good at what l do.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.052
l have a gift. l see trends.

43:59.136 --> 44:02.639
l see patterns.
l see things no one else will ever see.

44:02.723 --> 44:05.600
Evan is good, but he's not that good.

44:06.060 --> 44:08.394
l want you to find out
where he's getting his information.

44:08.896 --> 44:15.777
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

44:15.861 --> 44:17.528
-She's in a good mood tonight.
-That's great.

44:17.613 --> 44:20.073
We're all in a good mood.
Let's go through the cave then!

44:20.157 --> 44:21.199
Let's get in the cave,
going through the cave.

44:21.283 --> 44:22.825
Ducking down!
lt's a little above my head in the cave.

44:22.910 --> 44:25.870
And now we're coming out in France.
We're in France!

44:27.331 --> 44:29.082
All right.
And now we're back on the beach again.

44:29.166 --> 44:31.292
On the wonderful beach
with Kupida and Mopida.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.128
Hello, Kupida and Mopida!
How are the princesses today?

44:34.213 --> 44:36.547
-They're good.
-They're good. That's great.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.174
That's great.
Hold on to this for a second, honey.

44:38.258 --> 44:39.258
-Yeah.
-Okay, now.

44:39.343 --> 44:40.927
Ladies, l want to talk to you
about something.

44:41.011 --> 44:44.013
First, let me tell you that those gowns
you're wearing look exquisite.

44:44.098 --> 44:45.765
They look exquisite, ladies.

44:47.726 --> 44:50.645
l'll just go right out and say it.
Am l looking in the right direction here?

44:50.729 --> 44:52.021
-Yeah.
-Okay.

44:52.106 --> 44:55.692
l have a potential client
who is in the medical field

44:55.776 --> 44:56.859
and he has a particular company.

44:56.944 --> 44:58.778
He was wondering if
he should hold on to that company.

44:58.862 --> 45:01.531
And l was wondering if you ladies
had any feelings about that.

45:01.615 --> 45:04.617
The company is called VallaTech.

45:04.702 --> 45:07.036
l've just been hearing
so many incredible things about it.

45:07.121 --> 45:09.789
We were just wondering
what you princesses thought.

45:11.583 --> 45:14.001
-What do they think?
-Maybe.

45:16.463 --> 45:17.714
Maybe?

45:17.798 --> 45:23.219
Because Kupida very liked it,
and Mopida very hated it.

45:23.303 --> 45:24.679
Okay, so, now what do we do?

45:24.763 --> 45:29.976
lf they disagree, we have to see Qwali,
but she's at her mountain castle.

45:32.271 --> 45:34.105
Okay. Well,
where's the mountain castle?

45:34.648 --> 45:35.982
There.

45:38.819 --> 45:42.405
Now, does Qwali have to be out
by this bridge in front of my building,

45:42.489 --> 45:44.532
all these people all over the place,
where everybody can see us?

45:44.616 --> 45:46.075
We are not by a bridge.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.869
We're at the bottom of
Qwali's mountain!

45:47.953 --> 45:50.079
And there's no one here
except you and me,

45:50.164 --> 45:53.207
and maybe Qwali,
if she likes the way you dance.

45:53.292 --> 45:55.126
Dance? l have to dance for Qwali, too?

45:55.210 --> 45:59.255
Yeah. Because there's a ball tonight,
and she has to see who is the best king.

45:59.339 --> 46:01.924
And she will not talk until she does.

46:03.677 --> 46:07.930
Okay. Well, let's do a little dance
for Qwali, then.

46:10.225 --> 46:11.809
-Hey, Evan.
-Hey, what's going on, man?

46:11.894 --> 46:13.019
How are you...

46:16.774 --> 46:18.816
-Okay. How's that?
-Horrible.

46:18.901 --> 46:21.986
You have to get on that thing,
so she can see you.

46:22.070 --> 46:24.614
Hey, look. l'm not getting up
on the stage, all right?

46:24.698 --> 46:26.324
She won't talk to you.

46:26.408 --> 46:28.534
Okay, l'm gonna go get up on the stage.

46:39.838 --> 46:43.257
Oh, come on! She can't see that!
She's way, way up there.

46:43.342 --> 46:46.260
Hey, all right, okay. Take it easy here.

46:51.266 --> 46:52.850
More! Bigger!

46:54.728 --> 46:56.604
Like that? Like this? No? Yes?

46:56.688 --> 46:59.482
To the beat! Can't you hear the music?

46:59.566 --> 47:01.609
To the beat? l don't hear the beat.

47:01.693 --> 47:02.735
Check it out.

47:03.737 --> 47:05.571
l hear the snickers.

47:07.366 --> 47:09.242
lt's spinning music!

47:10.244 --> 47:13.704
-Spinning, with your arms out!
-You mean like a waltz?

47:15.332 --> 47:18.084
Like a waltz you're talking about. Okay.

47:51.034 --> 47:53.953
-That's the best l could do.
-No, it was good. She liked it.

47:54.037 --> 47:56.372
You can go to the ball!

47:56.456 --> 47:58.291
Okay, all right.

47:58.375 --> 48:00.960
Qwali said it was good.
l can go to the ball.

48:02.296 --> 48:06.132
Now, did you ask Qwali
how she feels about VallaTech?

48:08.427 --> 48:10.428
Bottom line, sir,
is that VallaTech is stuck up

48:10.512 --> 48:12.471
and doesn't play nice with others.
l say we cut it out.

48:12.556 --> 48:13.639
-Really?
-Yeah.

48:13.724 --> 48:15.182
l know this sounds a little unorthodox,

48:15.267 --> 48:16.559
but here's something else
you need to know.

48:16.643 --> 48:18.811
lt has a big butt?

48:18.896 --> 48:21.147
A big ol' butt with a shelf on it.

48:21.231 --> 48:24.650
l think if you look at DarbaCon's
bloated end-of-the-year rollover...

48:24.735 --> 48:27.236
...you'll see it has pretty hair
and all the boys are looking at it.

48:27.321 --> 48:30.323
Well, if he said it wets the bed,
then it wets the bed.

48:31.992 --> 48:33.242
What else did he say?

48:33.327 --> 48:36.495
This little company goes
wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home.

48:36.580 --> 48:40.625
-Did you say, "Wee-wee-wee-wee"?
-Yes. All the way home.

48:40.709 --> 48:42.835
-And people are buying that?
-By the millions.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.671
lcky, icky, icky. Gross. Yucky.

48:45.756 --> 48:48.382
Rose, is Evan seeing a psychic?

48:49.176 --> 48:50.217
Not that l'm aware of.

48:50.302 --> 48:51.886
lt's fizzy like a soda pop.

48:51.970 --> 48:54.513
-ls he a psychic?
-No, l don't believe he is.

48:54.765 --> 48:56.641
lt's old enough to start wearing makeup.

48:56.725 --> 48:59.101
"Ready for makeup." You feeling this?

48:59.186 --> 49:02.730
He says your funds are mature,
and now it's time to start diversifying.

49:02.814 --> 49:06.108
Specifically, for A.l.,
what l'm thinking is Argenteeny Pinkini.

49:06.193 --> 49:08.110
-l'm feeling that.
-Hey, l want some of that.

49:08.195 --> 49:09.278
Back off, dawg. lt's mine.

49:09.363 --> 49:12.490
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! There's enough
lip gloss to go around for everybody.

49:12.866 --> 49:17.578
Agroco is a crybaby who always
goes running to Mommy.

49:17.663 --> 49:19.538
-That's your analysis.
-Yes, it is.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.958
-And you recommend l...
-Sell.

49:22.042 --> 49:24.418
-Sell the crybaby.
-Sell the crybaby.

49:24.503 --> 49:25.962
ls this some kind ofjoke, Tom?

49:26.046 --> 49:28.422
-No, Carl. lt's not.
-Because it seems...

49:28.507 --> 49:30.675
-l know, a little different.
-A little?

49:30.759 --> 49:33.052
Why don't we hear
what Mr. Whitefeather has to say?

49:33.136 --> 49:34.762
Yes. Johnny, would you like to

49:34.846 --> 49:39.350
toss some spear at some tatonka,
or cast some venison into the potlatch?

49:39.977 --> 49:43.062
No, l wouldn't.
l'd like to take this seriously.

49:43.146 --> 49:45.398
There's a great deal of money
at stake here, Mr. Simons.

49:45.482 --> 49:48.776
l think that you should move forward
on Agroco, aggressively.

49:48.860 --> 49:50.486
lncrease your holdings.

49:50.570 --> 49:52.613
And a gentleman
by the name of Dante D'Enzo

49:52.698 --> 49:58.077
happens to concur with my position.
His company, D.D.E. lnvestments,

49:58.161 --> 50:02.039
is looking to increase
their holdings by 25%.

50:02.124 --> 50:06.627
So l think if we're going to make a move,
we have to do it rather quickly.

50:06.712 --> 50:09.255
lf you're ready, l'm ready.
Let's make some money.

50:11.008 --> 50:13.092
That's my "venison."

50:14.428 --> 50:16.303
Evan? Your thoughts?

50:20.100 --> 50:24.103
Well, l think that's interesting.
l think that's very interesting.

50:24.187 --> 50:26.564
Very, very, very interesting

50:27.190 --> 50:29.859
that Dante D'Enzo would say in
and l would say out.

50:29.943 --> 50:31.736
That's interesting, l think.

50:33.113 --> 50:34.697
What l'm going to do now
is l'm gonna go to the restroom,

50:34.781 --> 50:37.158
and l'm gonna think this through,
and l'm gonna re-crunch some numbers

50:37.242 --> 50:39.285
and get right back to you, gentlemen.
Excuse me.

50:40.495 --> 50:41.579
So...

50:52.758 --> 50:54.383
These look great.

50:54.468 --> 50:55.968
Evan?

50:56.053 --> 51:01.098
-Hey. Hey. What are you doing here?
-Flyers for Saturday. The Fall Sing.

51:01.183 --> 51:02.808
We're on lunch,
so l'm just dropping them off.

51:02.893 --> 51:05.269
-Hey, how you doing? l'm Rick.
-Rick.

51:05.353 --> 51:07.146
Rick's son, Henry, is in kindergarten.

51:07.230 --> 51:10.399
Yeah, so you're Rick.
You're the sculpture, sculptor.

51:10.484 --> 51:13.319
l saw your little thing that you did
at the Comerica building.

51:13.403 --> 51:15.571
-Yeah.
-Very metallic and pointy.

51:15.655 --> 51:17.073
And unfairly criticized, l might add.

51:17.157 --> 51:19.533
Look, l got some last-minute
parenting thing l gotta do with Olivia.

51:19.618 --> 51:21.702
Nice meeting you, Rick.

51:21.787 --> 51:23.662
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt. lt's Mr. Danielson.

51:23.747 --> 51:24.830
-Can l talk to Olivia for one second?
-Sure.

51:24.915 --> 51:26.624
l'll be brief. Olivia,
come talk to Daddy, please?

51:26.708 --> 51:27.750
Hi, everybody.

51:27.834 --> 51:31.003
l have some quick questions for Qwali
about Agroco. Where should we go?

51:31.379 --> 51:32.463
Come on. Come on. Come on.

51:32.547 --> 51:35.257
Okay. Did you bring the goo-gaa?
All right. Okay.

51:35.342 --> 51:39.220
l knew you would. Okay, perfect, perfect,
perfect. Blanket up. Rub in fast circles.

51:39.304 --> 51:42.598
l smell something burning.
lt's Sopida's dragon! Here she is!

51:42.682 --> 51:45.434
Mopida and Kupida! Good to see you!
Time to dance!

51:56.321 --> 51:58.322
-That's it.
-What are they doing?

51:58.406 --> 52:00.574
l have no idea.

52:00.659 --> 52:04.161
-She's really sure?
-And she says you agree with her.

52:04.246 --> 52:06.080
-l do?
-Don't you?

52:08.333 --> 52:10.501
-Yeah, l guess l do, sort of.
-Okay.

52:10.585 --> 52:11.961
Okay, give me a high five.

52:12.045 --> 52:13.129
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

52:13.213 --> 52:15.464
Put this back in. All right, tell no one!

52:18.051 --> 52:22.680
So you're saying that Dante D'Enzo
is totally wrong on this.

52:22.764 --> 52:23.806
Yes.

52:23.890 --> 52:26.183
And your inner child says that

52:26.268 --> 52:29.478
we should completely
pull out ofAgroco.

52:29.563 --> 52:31.313
Yes.

52:31.398 --> 52:35.359
Okay. l think l'm going to go with

52:35.443 --> 52:38.154
what Mr. Whitefeather
has put together here.

52:38.238 --> 52:40.906
lt seems better.

52:42.284 --> 52:46.328
-l am going to have the venison.
-lt's a savory meat.

52:50.584 --> 52:51.834
Doctor's office.

52:51.918 --> 52:55.629
l know you say Qwali's never wrong,
but l think we both were this time.

52:55.714 --> 52:59.758
lfjust Mopida says it
orjust Kupida says it,

52:59.843 --> 53:05.347
it could be wrong.
But if Qwali says it, it's never wrong.

53:05.932 --> 53:08.851
Well, l think
she kind of was wrong this time.

53:08.935 --> 53:11.145
-She was not.
-Yes, she was.

53:11.229 --> 53:12.646
-Was not.
-Yes, she was.

53:12.731 --> 53:14.148
Not.

53:15.609 --> 53:17.026
Actually, not.

53:17.110 --> 53:19.653
Ha, ha, you're just trying to get me
to say "was."

53:19.738 --> 53:21.864
No, she really wasn't wrong.

53:21.948 --> 53:24.325
D'Enzo pulled out ofAgroco,
which is down 1 2%.

53:24.409 --> 53:26.911
"Agroco cries foul,
hides behind parent company."

53:29.623 --> 53:31.540
Crybaby runs to Mommy.

53:37.464 --> 53:39.340
-How are you doing this?
-lt's easy.

53:39.424 --> 53:41.800
You just overlap them
and it makes a pyramid.

53:43.637 --> 53:47.806
Olivia? We're ready for you, sweetie.
Time for your shot.

53:51.478 --> 53:54.021
You did a really good job in there.
l'm really proud of you.

53:54.105 --> 53:56.649
For that, we're gonna get
a special ice cream treat.

53:56.733 --> 53:59.193
-l cried, though.
-But you did good.

53:59.277 --> 54:00.819
You see, when l was your age
l had to get a shot,

54:00.904 --> 54:03.864
l was running, screaming,
"Don't stab me! Don't stab me!"

54:03.949 --> 54:05.532
No, you wouldn't.

54:05.617 --> 54:07.910
"Don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!"

54:08.286 --> 54:10.120
How you doing, sir? What can l get you?

54:10.205 --> 54:11.997
Can we get two juice bars?

54:14.668 --> 54:17.795
-So, who wants pancakes for dinner?
-l do.

54:26.554 --> 54:28.264
Yeah, that's what l say.

54:40.026 --> 54:41.443
No, we're not going to pour it yet.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.988
Put butter on it.
Gotta put a small amount of butter.

54:47.158 --> 54:49.785
-You put too much butter.
-No, that's enough.

55:00.588 --> 55:02.506
Looks like Sopida's dragon
got to this one.

55:02.590 --> 55:05.092
-Hey!
-That's gonna be your stack.

55:05.176 --> 55:08.387
You keep going here
and l'll go set up the restaurant.

55:08.471 --> 55:10.389
The restaurant? What restaurant?

55:12.517 --> 55:15.894
-Allow me to tell you the specials.
-Please do.

55:15.979 --> 55:17.479
Pancakes.

55:17.564 --> 55:23.402
We have kind of burnt pancakes
and really burnt pancakes.

55:23.486 --> 55:25.154
Okay, well, how much for the regular?

55:25.905 --> 55:30.034
-Let me see. $3,000.
-And how much for the kind of burnt?

55:30.493 --> 55:32.536
-Forty-seven cents.
-Okay, let me have the kind of burnts.

55:32.620 --> 55:34.330
Let me have two kind of burnts, please.

55:34.414 --> 55:37.041
Perfect. Now do we have
any condiments or anything like...

55:37.125 --> 55:38.250
What do you mean by that?

55:38.335 --> 55:42.296
You know, like syrup or some honey
or some jelly or some...

55:42.380 --> 55:46.258
Anything that might cut the taste a bit.

55:51.681 --> 55:53.015
Ketchup.

55:54.476 --> 55:59.938
Chocolate syrup. Hot sauce.
And mustard.

56:00.023 --> 56:03.525
You know, l would have just went with
chocolate sauce or honey or...

56:03.610 --> 56:06.904
-Don't worry, it's yummier this way.
-But ketchup is...

56:06.988 --> 56:09.490
Wow. That's enough ketchup.

56:10.784 --> 56:15.871
-Now would you like chocolate sauce?
-Well, l guess so, yeah.

56:15.955 --> 56:19.041
-You probably would prefer it.
-Yeah, wow.

56:19.125 --> 56:21.126
Yeah, let's put a lot on.

56:22.462 --> 56:23.921
Mustard.

56:24.005 --> 56:27.716
Excellent choice.
Brown and yellow match perfectly.

56:27.801 --> 56:30.886
l think it's gonna add
some mystery to the dish.

56:30.970 --> 56:33.972
Don't eat it yet. We got the hot sauce.

56:35.975 --> 56:39.144
Hey, where...
What happened to the pancakes?

56:40.438 --> 56:42.523
There. Perfect.

56:42.607 --> 56:44.650
l think we should say our grace and eat.

56:44.734 --> 56:45.984
-Okay.
-Okay.

56:46.820 --> 56:49.029
-So, you pray with Daddy now.
-Okay.

56:49.114 --> 56:51.240
-Dear Lord.
-Dear Lord.

56:51.324 --> 56:54.743
-Please protect my daddy's throat.
-Please protect my daddy's throat.

56:54.828 --> 56:59.957
-He never done nothing to nobody, Lord.
-He never done nothing to nobody, Lord.

57:00.041 --> 57:01.500
-Amen.
-Amen.

57:01.584 --> 57:04.586
-And now l'm going to dig in.
-Yeah, dig in.

57:06.673 --> 57:10.259
And l think it's time
to ingest this pancake and be a good...

57:10.343 --> 57:12.177
Hey, look, it's Sopida.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.389
She's gone.

57:16.766 --> 57:19.143
That's the best pancake
l ever had in my life!

57:19.227 --> 57:22.688
-Can l please see the bill?
-Yeah, the bill?

57:23.440 --> 57:26.024
$400,000?
You must be out your mind, woman!

57:26.109 --> 57:28.485
You trying to get... Tell you what!
Come back here now! Come back here!

57:28.653 --> 57:30.654
Almost got you! Oh, my God!

57:31.531 --> 57:32.614
Yeah, that's a good one, too.

57:32.699 --> 57:34.533
Hold on, wait, wait, wait,
don't hog the picture now.

57:34.617 --> 57:35.826
You're gonna hog the picture.

57:35.910 --> 57:39.329
Wait, the picture's not right
unless Daddy's in the picture.

57:39.414 --> 57:42.624
That's magic! Come on, it's late.
Okay, come on.

57:44.335 --> 57:45.711
Daddy?

57:46.754 --> 57:49.590
l'm scared about
the Fall Sing on Saturday.

57:49.674 --> 57:52.050
What are you afraid of? Your mother
told me you were excited about it.

57:52.135 --> 57:56.388
Well, everybody has a solo
and mine is on the last song.

57:57.182 --> 58:01.935
And l start it, so if l mess up,
the whole entire song is wrecked.

58:02.020 --> 58:03.812
What makes you think
you're gonna mess up?

58:03.897 --> 58:04.980
l can't sing.

58:05.064 --> 58:07.065
-What do you mean you can't sing?
-l can't.

58:07.150 --> 58:09.902
Yes, you can.
Where's the song you're gonna sing?

58:09.986 --> 58:11.778
Let me see.

58:11.863 --> 58:13.655
l'll put it to the right page.

58:13.740 --> 58:14.990
-What song is it?
-Here, this page.

58:15.074 --> 58:16.617
All right, All You Need ls Love.

58:16.701 --> 58:18.118
Okay, that's a good one.
That's The Beatles.

58:18.203 --> 58:19.286
Tell you what, here's what you do.

58:19.370 --> 58:21.580
Come over here.
l'm going to get you onstage here.

58:21.664 --> 58:23.165
-This is the stage.
-l thought you'd play the part.

58:23.249 --> 58:25.167
No, you're gonna get on stage
and l'm gonna be in the audience.

58:25.251 --> 58:27.002
This is going to be
just like you're at the play.

58:27.086 --> 58:29.004
And all the people in the audience
all came to see the show.

58:29.088 --> 58:31.215
We're all like, "This is great.
Well, l can't wait to see the show.

58:31.299 --> 58:33.842
"Who's in the show? Well, who's that?
l wonder if she can sing."

58:33.927 --> 58:35.511
You've got to get ready now.
You got to get ready,

58:35.595 --> 58:37.346
see, 'cause everybody's watching,
everybody's watching.

58:37.430 --> 58:38.847
And you're going to say...

58:38.932 --> 58:41.183
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

58:41.267 --> 58:42.851
-l can't.
-Yes, you can!

58:42.936 --> 58:46.855
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

58:46.940 --> 58:48.023
Here's how you're singing it.

58:48.107 --> 58:50.567
You say it and then you take
the last word and just stretch it out.

58:50.652 --> 59:03.247
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

59:03.331 --> 59:04.915
All right, now, here's the second line.

59:04.999 --> 59:09.962
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

59:10.046 --> 59:11.213
And we go higher now.

59:11.297 --> 59:15.425
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

59:15.510 --> 59:17.010
A little higher though. Higher. Higher.

59:17.095 --> 59:19.930
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

59:20.014 --> 59:22.224
My baby sounds like Minnie Riperton!

59:22.308 --> 59:24.017
Okay, let's drop it lower.
Let's do it like a frog.

59:24.102 --> 59:25.936
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

59:26.020 --> 59:28.522
Daddy, you're just doing
what l did to you.

59:28.606 --> 59:30.983
Yeah, that's right. l'm doing
what you did to me. Now let's try it.

59:31.067 --> 59:35.237
There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

59:35.321 --> 59:37.322
See, you're doing it.
Okay, here's the next one.

59:37.407 --> 59:38.448
There's nothing you can say

59:38.533 --> 59:41.660
But you can Iearn how to pIay the game
It's easy

59:41.744 --> 59:44.705
There's nothing you can say
But you can Iearn how to pIay the game

59:44.789 --> 59:52.087
It's easy

59:52.171 --> 59:54.506
That's it! That's it! You're singing!

59:55.675 --> 59:59.511
Take a bow! She was wonderful!

59:59.846 --> 01:00:02.097
-You're going to the top!
-Oh, stop.

01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:04.975
She's going to the top!

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:10.063
"They finish reading. Olivia's mother
gives her a kiss and says,

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:14.443
"'You know, you really wear me out,
but l love you anyway.'

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:18.614
"Olivia gives her a kiss back and says,
'l love you anyway, too."'

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.659
There you go, sleepyhead.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.123
Hey!

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:32.377
We didn't talk to the princesses tonight.

01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:35.964
Yeah, you know what, we didn't,
but that's okay.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:37.132
lt's quite all right.

01:00:37.216 --> 01:00:41.303
Well, maybe if you want,
you can talk to them yourself.

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.722
Really? On my own?

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:46.683
Qwali says she trusts you now.

01:00:49.562 --> 01:00:51.146
That's very nice of Qwali.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:54.191
Tell Qwali thanks a lot.
That means a lot to me.

01:00:54.275 --> 01:00:56.735
Or l could tell her myself.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:57.903
You want me to?

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:03.575
Hey, you want me to?

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:07.829
Did you fall asleep that quick?

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:41.905
l send you out to gather
pertinent information.

01:01:41.989 --> 01:01:43.073
You come back with this.

01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:46.034
But this is all he does.
He just hangs out with his daughter.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.453
They sing and they dance
and they laugh.

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:52.374
They're playing with a blanket.

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:54.793
The two of them with their faces buried

01:01:57.004 --> 01:01:58.338
in a blanket.

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:03.135
The blanket.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:09.057
-It's a wakaIyapi.
-Yeah.

01:02:11.102 --> 01:02:14.563
He's a sharp cat. He is a razor cat!

01:02:15.356 --> 01:02:17.774
-Say that again?
-WakaIyapi.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:20.527
A tapestry. A weave.

01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:23.780
lt's how you access a higher eye.

01:02:24.323 --> 01:02:27.868
My people believe it's the way
to achieve closeness to the Great Spirit.

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:30.912
-Who are you calling?
-You'll see.

01:02:31.372 --> 01:02:34.166
The entire Denver financial community
is talking about you.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:36.209
But as your very first client ever,

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:39.087
you owe it to me to tell me
what the hell is going on.

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:40.881
l told you, Maggie, l'm just listening.

01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:44.342
To the little voice that whispers to you.
Yeah, right.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.511
Why don't you just tell her your secret?

01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:52.184
-Hi. Johnny Whitefeather.
-l'm Margaret Johnson.

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:55.437
Evan? Tell her the truth.

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:04.404
Okay, Maggie, here's the truth.
l have a six-year-old daughter.

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:07.365
Now, she has what you would
have to call a magic blanket.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.367
Now, with this blanket,
l can be taken and be transported

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:10.952
to a mystical, magical place

01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:14.206
where l meet with three
invisible princesses and one queen.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:17.250
lncidentally, they all have
remarkable insight to investing,

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:20.128
except for one,
who mostly wants to throw rocks at me

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:22.380
and have me burned up by her dragon.

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:25.884
A securities blanket.

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:30.889
Fine, fine. Keep your secret.
Just keep me in the black.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.977
l can get a blanket.

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.732
l can. And l'm going to get one.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.945
l need to see you guys
in my office, please.

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:48.323
You may have noticed l've been doing
things a little differently this past week,

01:03:48.407 --> 01:03:51.701
letting the two of you go head-to-head
a bit more than usual.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:56.164
And l know you've probably
heard the rumor, and it's true.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:59.709
There's an offer on the table,
and it's big.

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:02.337
lt's the kind of out l've been looking for.

01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:08.593
But the buyer wants to make sure that
there's someone worthy to, well,

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:12.305
to take this office. So...

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.350
Here we go.

01:04:15.434 --> 01:04:20.272
Gentlemen, this is
Mr. Pratt of D.D.E. lnvestments.

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:23.650
-You're Frederick Pratt.
-Yes. Yes, l am. Excuse me.

01:04:23.734 --> 01:04:26.528
-Yes, sir.
-That's the suitor? Dante D'Enzo?

01:04:26.612 --> 01:04:28.530
-He's ready for you.
-Hello there.

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:31.992
Mr. D'Enzo.
What an honor it is to meet you, sir.

01:04:32.076 --> 01:04:35.620
Thank you. Have a seat, gentIemen.
This won't take Iong.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:38.039
l assume that Tom
has aIready toId you about...

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.754
-Mr. DanieIson, everything okay?
-Yes. Yes, sir.

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:47.215
Just had to kill the phone. lt's dead now.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.968
Okay, l assume Tom
had aIready toId you that

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:53.346
he's decided to throw away
the rest of his Iife pIaying goIf.

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:58.018
Which means one of you is going to be
running the western division of D.D.E.

01:04:58.102 --> 01:05:01.229
Now, you won't be surprised to know
that I've been reviewing your fiIes,

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:05.400
and, frankIy, you're both
appIying quite unorthodox methods.

01:05:05.484 --> 01:05:09.404
And I don't reaIIy care, as Iong as you
get resuIts, which you seem to be doing.

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:11.156
But, unfortunateIy, gentIemen,

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.159
there's onIy one chair
behind the big desk.

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:17.245
So I have a decision to make,
and I'II be stopping in Denver

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.998
on my way back from Beijing tomorrow
to make that decision.

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:23.084
In the meantime,
you have approximateIy 17 hours

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:26.296
to suss out what Mr. Pratt
is about to hand you.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.715
And as far as preparation is concerned,

01:05:28.799 --> 01:05:31.676
I'II just share with you
the best advice that l ever heard...

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.101
No, that's not the advice.

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:43.772
The advice is, if I had eight hours
to chop down a tree,

01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:47.067
I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.

01:05:47.151 --> 01:05:49.444
-Abraham Lincoln.
-You read my book.

01:05:49.528 --> 01:05:52.030
-Three times, sir.
-lt wasn't clear the first time?

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:54.491
No, that's not what l meant.

01:05:54.575 --> 01:05:57.285
I think I know what you meant,
Mr. Danielson.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:59.955
AII right, gentIemen,
it's 2:00 a.m. in Beijing.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.957
Do you know where your ax is?

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.209
I'II see you tomorrow.
May the best man win.

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:10.173
These are a few of the strategies
Mr. D'Enzo is considering.

01:06:10.257 --> 01:06:14.302
We will require your most
detailed analysis and recommendations.

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:16.054
l'll leave you with Mr. Pratt.

01:06:18.432 --> 01:06:20.934
Okay, page one.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:32.028
Olivia! Hey! Olivia!

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:35.699
Big night! Big, big night tonight! Hey!
Where are you?

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.660
l want to talk to princesses
and Qwali and all your friends!

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:40.662
Got a lot of questions!
Get to stay up late!

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:44.416
Hey, Olivia! Hey! Where are you?

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:47.502
Graciella, where is she? You picked
her up from school, didn't you?

01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:50.088
Yes, seÃ±or. Then Mrs. Trish came
and took her away.

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:53.091
-What? When?
-About one hour ago.

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.093
Now, why would she do that
without calling me?

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:58.346
You know why? Because
l took the battery out of my phone.

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:01.850
Hey, listen!
Hey, did Olivia leave that little blanket?

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:04.686
-The goo-gaa?
-Let me check, okay, seÃ±or?

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:06.104
-Hello!
-Trish! Hey!

01:07:06.605 --> 01:07:07.731
Evan, where are you?

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:11.192
Olivia called you, like, five times,
then she got upset and called me.

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:12.777
And then l had to leave the pledge drive
to make sure...

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.362
lt's a long story.
l took the battery out of my phone.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:16.031
But, listen, you'll never guess
who l was just talking to.

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:17.991
Not now, Evan. l'm at the party.

01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:20.035
-The party? What party?
-Ella's party.

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:22.829
-Which you obviously forgot about.
-Forgot it. Forgot all about the party.

01:07:22.913 --> 01:07:25.415
Okay, listen, tell Olivia l'm gonna be
there in 20 minutes to pick her up.

01:07:25.499 --> 01:07:26.666
Why? I'm aIready here.

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:28.877
Look, you did your week.
l'll just stay here

01:07:28.961 --> 01:07:30.837
and take her to Ella's for the sleepover.

01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:34.299
Sleepover! No, no, no. l don't know if
a sleepover works for me tonight, Trish.

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:37.969
l actually need Olivia here with me.
Here with me and her blanket, yes.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.137
Her what?

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.597
Listen, l know this is going to sound
a little crazy.

01:07:40.681 --> 01:07:42.599
l know this is going to sound a little wild,

01:07:42.683 --> 01:07:44.476
but the fact of the matter is...

01:07:45.936 --> 01:07:48.938
l need... l need the goo-gaa.

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:52.067
l don't have a response for that, Evan.

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:53.985
-No, Trish, Iisten.
-l'm hanging up now.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.321
-Bye.
-No, no, no, Trish, Trish, Trish!

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:13.129
Okay, if you're here
for EIIa's birthday party,

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:16.466
make your way to the orange sIide
and into the Kidz Only zone

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.635
for some Fo Fo FiggIey fun.

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:20.011
Olivia!

01:08:21.846 --> 01:08:24.390
-Trish, you want me...
-No, l'll deal with this.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.977
Olivia!

01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:31.439
Evan, what is going on?
What are you doing here?

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.274
l know, l know. Everything's fine.
Everything's cool.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.026
Look, where did she go just now?

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.444
She went into the Kidz Only room.
What is this, Evan?

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:38.904
Nothing. Everything's fine.
Everything's cool.

01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:40.657
-Hey. How we doing over here?
-What's going on? How you?

01:08:40.741 --> 01:08:41.866
l'm good.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:44.452
Trish, do you mind helping Lori
with the cake for me?

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:45.620
Yeah, help Lori with the cake,

01:08:45.703 --> 01:08:47.372
and l'm gonna do
what l was going to do.

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:50.291
-lt's my daughter's seventh birthday!
-Congratulations.

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:51.501
You're going to think this is hilarious,

01:08:51.585 --> 01:08:53.920
but l got to go get Olivia's blanket for,
like, six hours.

01:08:54.004 --> 01:08:56.631
-You need her blanket.
-Yes, l need her blanket.

01:08:56.715 --> 01:08:58.966
l see, so that's what you're here for,
to cause a scene.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:00.426
l'm not trying to cause a scene at all.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.804
You're making it a scene by stopping
me from going to get the blanket.

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:05.223
You should just let me go get the
blanket, and there's no scene at all.

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:06.850
-Let me talk to you for a second.
-What's the problem?

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:09.310
Now we've all seen what happens
when you take Liv's blanket, right?

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:12.397
-Okay, that's duly noted.
-And now is not the time nor place for it.

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:15.316
Let me explain something to you.
Let me say something.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.277
What l'm going to do
is going to take all of 1 0 seconds.

01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:19.154
l'm gonna get the blanket,
and l'm going to be gone.

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:21.488
And that's the end of the deal,
you know what l'm saying, John?

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:24.283
Let me do my thing.
Hey, what's the matter with you?

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:25.368
John...

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:27.912
Hey, what's up
with the football block, man?

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:30.707
-Hey, be cool.
-You be cool, okay?

01:09:30.791 --> 01:09:34.042
l am being cool. l just need the goo-gaa!

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:36.880
Okay, when a grown man says
"goo-gaa," it's time to go.

01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:38.256
Okay, all right.

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.136
Okay, all right. lt's cool. All right.
You made your point.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.764
You got it. You gotta be cool.

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:50.393
l'll tell her you said happy birthday.
Yeah.

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:53.313
She'll be touched.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.697
Hey, John. ls everything okay?

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:05.575
-l took care of it. He's gone.
-What did you say?

01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:07.744
Don't worry about it.
l put my foot down, okay?

01:10:07.828 --> 01:10:10.079
That's the last we're gonna see
of Evan today.

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:31.809
You wanna play, boy? Man, stop.
No, you didn't.

01:10:31.977 --> 01:10:35.563
Hey, little brother. Hey, brother.
Hey, my man. Hey, little man.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:38.399
Hey, why don't you do me a favor?
l want you to go into the Kidz Only room

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:40.485
and talk to Olivia Danielson and tell her
her dad's out here.

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:43.071
l'm gonna give you $20. Go in there
and tell her that her dad's out here

01:10:43.155 --> 01:10:45.406
-and needs the goo-gaa.
-A what?

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.784
lt's a goo-gaa. lt's a pet name for
the blanket. l need the blanket.

01:10:47.868 --> 01:10:50.286
Just go in, tell Olivia Danielson
her dad's out here and get the blanket.

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:51.829
$20, man. Come on, brother.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:54.332
-l'll take $50, my brother.
-50?

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:58.294
Or you can take your grown self up there
and get the goo-gaa on your own.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.173
Hey, stop it! l'm not in here
to play with you kids. Stop it!

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:05.093
Look, man, l haven't been to the
cash machine. All l got is $26 in here.

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:07.637
See, that's more than half of $50.

01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:11.140
And l got this.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:14.185
A Peet's Coffee card.
l got $1 5 worth of credit on it.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.895
You know how much coffee
you can get for $1 5?

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.398
You drink that coffee, you just keep
playing and playing and playing!

01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:20.650
-l'm a kid. l don't drink coffee.
-They got other things.

01:11:20.734 --> 01:11:23.778
They got cookies and cakes and scones.
You like scones?

01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:26.364
Scones? What do l look like,
the Queen of England?

01:11:27.157 --> 01:11:29.284

You're not getting my Rollie.
Come on, man. This is $26.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:40.336

easy money. You want it or not?

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:42.255
Not. Get this fool!

01:11:44.091 --> 01:11:45.550
Hey, stop it right now!

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.889
Grandfather, will you bless the blanket?

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:05.737
Here's the... This guy?

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:08.865
The blanket works best
through the innocence of a child.

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.786
Okay. Good. Thank you.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:19.500

And l can do this,
and l do not need the goo-gaa.

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:41.689

The relationship of this currency
to this company five years out.

01:13:06.423 --> 01:13:09.801
Maybe if you want,
you can talk to them yourself.

01:13:12.262 --> 01:13:14.430
This is a wakalyapi, okay?

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:18.059

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:18.786
The fact of the matter is
I need the goo-gaa.

l'm taking them to get them cleaned,
because they're dirty.

01:17:40.405 --> 01:17:42.365
You go back to sleep. Night-night.

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:54.502
-Mr. Danielson?
-Hey, hey, what's going on, Will?

Yeah, man!

01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:42.651
Johnny!

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:45.946
Come inside before the neighbors
call the fire department again!

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:48.491
Hey, Cheryl! We're down here working!

01:19:48.575 --> 01:19:51.243
You think your new nose
just crawled on your face?

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:55.748
-What's the next one?
-John!

01:19:55.832 --> 01:19:56.832

01:20:00.712 --> 01:20:02.797
Listen, it's getting late.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:06.300
l think we need
to rethink this blanket strategy.

01:20:06.718 --> 01:20:09.011
-You doubting the wakalyapi?
-No, no, no. Absolutely not.

01:20:09.095 --> 01:20:12.014

-ls that what you are saying?
-l see beyond, like the great salmon!

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:19.188
With wings! That flies!

01:20:19.272 --> 01:20:20.898
You got tiny eyes, man.

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:23.901
-You got the eyes of a salamander.
-What?

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:26.403
You say my kid's not a seer?
He's a Whitefeather!

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.864
Come here, boy! Get over here!

01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:31.283
AampCo! What you feeling
about AampCo?

01:20:31.368 --> 01:20:32.952
AampCo is tight!

01:20:33.036 --> 01:20:36.163
-AampCo is tight! Write that down!
-Write that down!

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:38.374
No, Johnny,
l'm not gonna write it down, okay?

01:20:38.458 --> 01:20:41.168
l can't go to Dante D'Enzo and say,
"AampCo is tight

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:43.087
"because we're listening
to the Great Winged Salmon,

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:46.507
"who's actually a 1 0-year-old boy
with a $6,000 blanket,

01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:48.843
"who's hopped up on Red Bull!"

01:20:51.596 --> 01:20:54.765
Listen to me, Johnny.
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.852
We can't blow this thing.
You are better than this.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.813
-Tell him he's out.
-You're out!

01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:03.524
-What?
-Tell him he's out of the tribe.

01:21:03.608 --> 01:21:05.943
-You're out of the tribe!
-l'm out of the tribe?

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:10.197
You're out of the tribe, because
you're blind to the poetry of smoke!

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:11.365
Blind to the poetry of...

01:21:11.449 --> 01:21:14.535
Stop it! Just zip it! Zip it!
You are a crazy little kid!

01:21:14.619 --> 01:21:17.663
And you, you're a liar! l'm out?

01:21:17.747 --> 01:21:22.501
Good. Wrap it up! l have never been
so happy to be out, okay?

l didn't go to business school for this!
l graduated from Stanford with an MBA!

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:29.800
And they don't just give
those things away, Whitefeather!

01:21:31.094 --> 01:21:33.846
-Get him.
-Back off, you little freak!

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.640
Get some sleep!

01:21:38.768 --> 01:21:40.519
Hey, Trish, it's me!

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:48.527
-Trish, l really need to see her.
-No, no. l just now got her to sleep.

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:50.779
And with tonight,
and singing tomorrow...

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:53.490
-Please. Please, Trish.
-She just...

01:21:56.494 --> 01:21:57.578

Thank you.

01:22:05.837 --> 01:22:07.630

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:18.933
About the concert...

l'm not going to be able to
come to the concert,

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:23.395

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.022
l don't want you there.

01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:30.819

01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:43.415
l won't because you don't want me to.

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:46.502
But...

01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:49.213
Liv, l really have to go to this meeting.

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:52.716

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:39.138
-Everything.
-Okay, well, then you understand.

01:23:39.222 --> 01:23:41.598
No, l don't understand.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:44.018
l mean, do you honestly believe that
that blanket

01:23:44.102 --> 01:23:46.687
has something to do
with everything that's been going on?

01:23:46.771 --> 01:23:49.648
Look, l don't know what's happening.
l know something's happening.

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:52.067
l need for it to happen
one more time tonight.

01:23:52.777 --> 01:23:55.112
So, now we're back to what you need.

01:23:55.655 --> 01:23:56.780
Hey, Trish, what do you want me to do?

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:59.158
Blow off an opportunity
l've been waiting for since grad school

01:23:59.242 --> 01:24:00.534
and lose my job?

01:24:00.618 --> 01:24:06.623
Evan, you have two jobs,
and one of those jobs is being a father.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:07.916
And she needs to know

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:11.211
that you care as much about that job
as you do the other.

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:14.590
-l do. Of course l do.
-Then leave the blanket.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:20.804
l can't. Not tonight, l can't.

01:24:21.806 --> 01:24:23.640
l don't expect you to understand.

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:32.352
How you doing, Feather Man?
Pretty good, brother. How you doing?

01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:36.398
Not so bad. A little amped, a little tired.
Ain't nothing but a thing.

01:26:36.482 --> 01:26:38.442
How about another Red Bull?
Wouldn't say no to that.

01:27:27.659 --> 01:27:30.577
-Good luck, Johnny.
-Luck is for losers.

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:38.293
Good. Here we are.
Gentlemen, this is Mr. D'Enzo.

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.754
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you, sir.

01:27:40.838 --> 01:27:43.507
Mr. D'Enzo. John Whitefeather.

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:45.092
Have a seat, guys.

01:27:51.891 --> 01:27:56.436
D-Papa-D to the Feather Man.
l think you're reading my signals.

01:27:56.521 --> 01:27:58.105
And l think you're reading them
loud and clear.

01:27:58.189 --> 01:28:01.525
You're getting the wisdom.
Diversification.

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:02.901
Buy long, sell short.

01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:04.987
-Sell short, buy long.
-Hi.

01:28:05.071 --> 01:28:07.823
Good morning, everyone.
Welcome to the Fall Sing.

01:28:07.907 --> 01:28:10.617
It's so good to see
so many of you here today.

01:28:10.702 --> 01:28:13.829
WeII, I can hear a Iot of
very excited chiIdren back there,

01:28:13.913 --> 01:28:17.291
who, Iike their parents, are not here
to Iisten to me continue taIking.

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:23.005
So without further ado,
the wonderful Chilton School choir.

01:28:39.022 --> 01:28:43.025
Summer fades into the blue

01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:46.570
Brand new colors come into view

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:50.782
Seasons change
I have, too

01:28:51.242 --> 01:28:55.078
Just like the leaves of autumn

01:28:55.621 --> 01:28:59.249
You know what l see in this room
that nobody else sees?

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:00.584
Hidden feathers.

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:04.254
That's what we share, hidden feathers!
Crow feathers.

01:29:05.631 --> 01:29:07.049
Right now,

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:10.218
l need you to caw with me.

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:14.014
One crow to another crow.

01:29:21.105 --> 01:29:23.690
Bring it. Come on. Bring it in.

01:29:34.243 --> 01:29:37.537
l know you want to let it out,
but l appreciate you keeping it in.

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:41.666
There it be, brother crow.

01:29:43.294 --> 01:29:45.337
Look forward to working with you, man.

01:29:50.426 --> 01:29:51.593
Wow.

01:29:53.304 --> 01:29:55.722
l've never seen anything like that before.

01:29:55.807 --> 01:29:57.224
l know.

01:29:57.308 --> 01:29:59.726
No, you don't know.

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:04.189
Quite frankly, that's one of the
biggest loads of crap l've ever heard.

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:07.234
What possible excuse can you give us

01:30:07.318 --> 01:30:12.030
for wasting our time
with that unctuous stream of drivel

01:30:12.115 --> 01:30:14.032
that you call a presentation?

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.912
-My kid.
-What?

01:30:18.996 --> 01:30:20.205
My kid.

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:24.126
He's been wanting to get more involved
in my workplace life.

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.753
He's like, "Dad, l'm on a vision quest.
l got some investment ideas."

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:30.173
l'm like, "You're nine.
How many good ideas could you have?"

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:32.634
He's on a vision quest. l'm like,
"Vision quest, my red butt! But..."

01:30:32.718 --> 01:30:34.261
You're blaming your child?

01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:38.265
-Look, don't let it rattle your corn stalk...
-All right, enough!

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.768
l don't mind this lndian business
when it's working.

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:45.856
-When it's not, it's just annoying.
-Whoa!

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:50.026
-That's deep shadow time.
-Seriously, cut the crap.

01:30:51.654 --> 01:30:53.947
You're not even a real Native American.

01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:56.783
The fact is
you're mostly Finnish-Armenian.

01:30:56.868 --> 01:30:59.786
Your baptismal name
is Johann Hasuvian.

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:03.290
And your great-grandfather
was one half Navajo.

01:31:03.374 --> 01:31:06.877
So, what would that make you? 1/32?

01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:11.173
Frankly, you are an offense
to true Native Americans,

01:31:11.257 --> 01:31:15.093
-and if you have nothing better to offer...
-All right, all right.

01:31:15.178 --> 01:31:18.221
Johnny Whitefeather can see
which way this wind's blowing.

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:24.019
lt's your loss! Old croaking toad.

01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:32.611
l'm going this way!

01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:39.534
Well, Mr. Danielson?

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:43.497
Looks like this job is yours to lose.

01:31:45.583 --> 01:31:47.375
l'll get right to it.

01:32:01.891 --> 01:32:03.391
Mr. Danielson?

01:32:04.101 --> 01:32:05.185
Evan?

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.356
l can't do this.

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:11.608
l'm sorry?

01:32:11.943 --> 01:32:14.069
l messed up. l really have.

01:32:14.445 --> 01:32:15.612
Sorry, what?

01:32:19.075 --> 01:32:23.119
-Are you walking out?
-l'm really sorry, sir. l just can't.

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:25.038
You realize what you're giving up?

01:32:29.627 --> 01:32:31.127
Yes, sir, l do.

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:35.590
Sorry, Tom.

01:32:42.431 --> 01:32:44.057
Could l see that brochure, please?

01:32:49.313 --> 01:32:51.940
Ain't nothing but a thing, man.

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:29.185
Next, we wiII sing
a traditionaI Japanese foIk song

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:32.689
about the bIooming
of the cherry blossom, the Sakura.

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:20.612
Sorry! Sorry about that!

01:34:29.372 --> 01:34:32.999
The next song is one you aII know,
so feeI free to sing aIong.

01:34:33.084 --> 01:34:36.252
Just don't sing Iouder than us.
lt's our concert.

01:34:44.887 --> 01:35:23.633
Love, Iove, Iove

01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:29.783
There's nothing you can do
that can't be done

01:36:29.867 --> 01:36:32.702
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung

01:36:33.329 --> 01:36:36.664
Nothing you can say
But you can Iearn how to pIay the game

01:36:36.749 --> 01:36:38.833
It's easy

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:43.546
There's nothing you can make
that can't be made

01:36:43.881 --> 01:36:47.008
No one you can save
That can't be saved

01:36:47.384 --> 01:36:51.221
Nothing you can do
But you can Iearn how to be you in time

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:53.223
It's easy

01:36:55.434 --> 01:37:01.231
AII you need is Iove

01:37:03.275 --> 01:37:06.402
AII you need is Iove, Iove

01:37:07.196 --> 01:37:09.447
Love is aII you need

01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:12.826

AII together now
AII you need is Iove

01:37:22.378 --> 01:37:24.796
Love is aII you need

01:37:42.982 --> 01:37:44.858
Nice king hat.

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:48.027
lt's called a crown.

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.868
You know,
you were really great in there.

01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:57.662
-Thanks.
-Hey, listen, l got something for you.

01:38:00.624 --> 01:38:03.293
-l don't need it anymore.
-Really?

01:38:04.086 --> 01:38:05.545
l was hoping you would take it,
and, you know,

01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:07.881
you'd help me apologize
to the princesses.

01:38:07.965 --> 01:38:10.675
-You can do it yourself.
-l can?

01:38:10.759 --> 01:38:12.343
Yeah, they're right there.

01:38:14.096 --> 01:38:16.764
Okay. Well...

01:38:18.183 --> 01:38:21.728
Sopida, l wish that l could say
you were wrong about me,

01:38:21.812 --> 01:38:24.939
but, obviously,
you and your dragon knew better.

01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:26.357
l'm sorry.

01:38:27.484 --> 01:38:30.320
Thank you for protecting Olivia
while l was away.

01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:32.989
And Kupida and Mopida,

01:38:33.866 --> 01:38:37.785
l'm sorry for taking you for granted
and just expecting things from you

01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:41.247
and not realizing how smart and kind

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:44.792
and truly amazing you really are.

01:38:45.544 --> 01:38:47.128
Qwali, thank you so much

01:38:47.212 --> 01:38:50.924
for letting me come into your mystical,
magical world,

01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:56.179
-'cause it's a truly magical...
-Daddy, they're leaving. They got bored.

01:38:56.722 --> 01:38:58.473
They were bored.

01:39:00.184 --> 01:39:02.727
Do you want me to ask them to stay?

01:39:02.811 --> 01:39:04.520
Well, what do they want to do?

01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:10.193
They said it's time for them to go.

01:39:13.197 --> 01:39:15.323
Well, then l think they should go then.

01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:17.533
Wave goodbye.

01:39:23.916 --> 01:39:25.667
There they go.

01:39:37.846 --> 01:39:39.722
Hey, guys. What you doing?

01:39:40.432 --> 01:39:43.810
Just waving goodbye to Qwali
and the princesses.

01:39:43.894 --> 01:39:47.021
Really? They're going away?

01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:49.899
How about that?

01:39:52.236 --> 01:39:55.154
You know, l think
there's somebody here to see you.

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.413
Wow, so, they're really gone?

01:40:10.087 --> 01:40:11.504
Nice outfit.

01:40:13.173 --> 01:40:16.509
l take it this is why
you walked out of our meeting.

01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:23.057
Do you know how many people
have ever done anything like that to me?

01:40:26.103 --> 01:40:28.187
-Two.
-Two.

01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:32.150
You want to know where they are
in their careers right now?

01:40:32.234 --> 01:40:35.403
Each one is running
a key division of my company.

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.991
l don't want any sycophants around me.
l want people with confidence

01:40:40.075 --> 01:40:43.286
who are not afraid to make decisions,
even under pressure.

01:40:44.079 --> 01:40:46.122
lncidentally, this is very good.

01:40:47.958 --> 01:40:50.126
You are very good indeed,

01:40:51.003 --> 01:40:53.755
and l want you
to head our western division.

01:40:54.423 --> 01:40:57.425
l'd like to discuss that with you,
so, please...

01:41:03.474 --> 01:41:08.144
Sir, l would love to discuss it now,
but it's Saturday.

01:41:11.315 --> 01:41:13.024
Sure.

01:41:13.108 --> 01:41:16.444
-Well, Monday, then.
-Monday.

01:41:17.863 --> 01:41:21.449
-Well, congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:24.243
l have a daughter, too.

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:27.413
l haven't seen her for years.

01:41:30.667 --> 01:41:35.505
-So, have a pleasant Saturday.
-You, too, sir.

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.598
So, what are you guys doing
with the rest of the day?

01:41:45.682 --> 01:41:46.933
l don't know. What do you want to do?

01:41:47.017 --> 01:41:51.479
l think Mommy should get a chance
to try some of your special pancakes.
