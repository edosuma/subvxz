00:01.001 --> 00:03.035
<i>My name is avery ryan.</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:05.571
<i>I was a victim of cyber crime.</i>

00:05.573 --> 00:08.240
<i>Like you, I posted</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

00:08.242 --> 00:11.076
<i>Checked my bank account</i>
<i>balance online,</i>

00:11.078 --> 00:13.078
<i>Even kept</i>
<i>the confidential files</i>

00:13.080 --> 00:15.314
<i>Of my psychological practice</i>
<i>on my computer.</i>

00:17.083 --> 00:20.019
<i>Then I was hacked,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:22.154
<i>One of my patients</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

00:22.156 --> 00:25.024
My investigation into her death
<i>led me to the fbi,</i>

00:25.026 --> 00:27.626
<i>Where I joined a team</i>
<i>of cyber experts</i>

00:27.628 --> 00:30.529
<i>To wage a war against</i>
<i>a new breed of criminal</i>

00:30.531 --> 00:33.565
<i>Hiding on the deep web...</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:36.635
<i>Infiltrating our daily lives</i>
<i>in ways we never imagined...</i>

00:38.338 --> 00:40.339
<i>...Faceless...</i>

00:40.341 --> 00:42.541
<i>Nameless...</i>

00:42.543 --> 00:44.343
<i>Lurking inside our devices,</i>

00:44.345 --> 00:46.812
<i>Just a keystroke away.</i>

00:59.793 --> 01:01.527
Hey, man.

01:01.529 --> 01:02.528
Turn your phone off.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.695
What?
Turn...

01:03.697 --> 01:05.531
Your phone off.
The screen's bright.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.067
What the hell are you talking
about? My phone's in my pocket.

01:08.069 --> 01:09.535
Oh, really? Then what's that

01:09.537 --> 01:10.803
Lit under your chair?
That's not my phone.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.071
Attendant:
Hey, guys, come on.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.139
Quiet, or you're
both out of here.

01:29.522 --> 01:30.589
Oh, my god.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.568
Move! Out of the way, move!

01:49.442 --> 01:52.644
Run, run, it's a bomb, get away!

01:52.646 --> 01:54.746
Back away, back away,
it's a bomb!

01:55.648 --> 01:57.149
Move!

01:57.151 --> 01:59.451
(car alarms wailing)

02:16.336 --> 02:17.636
Sifter:
So far, we believe

02:17.638 --> 02:20.339
It was a remote detonation
using a tablet.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.141
Call you when
I have more.

02:22.143 --> 02:24.643
Somebody's putting a little
extra time in the field, huh?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.545
Yeah, when a bomb
detonates in the capital,

02:26.547 --> 02:28.614
(phone dings)
it is all hands on deck.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.482
Yeah. I spoke to atf.
They're waking up

02:30.484 --> 02:31.783
Every local scumbag
that's ever

02:31.785 --> 02:33.585
Set off a bomb.
As of now,

02:33.587 --> 02:36.522
The medical examiner just
confirmed six dead, 30 injured.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.524
You could multiply
that number by ten

02:38.526 --> 02:41.393
If that kid had not gotten
that bomb out of that theater.

02:41.395 --> 02:44.830
Avery, I gotta brief the
white house in 30 minutes.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.732
I'm gonna have
to show my hand.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.434
I want to be
holding some face cards.

02:49.436 --> 02:50.736
Let me see what the boys have.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.172
(helicopter hovering)

02:53.174 --> 02:54.840
What have we got?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.708
Collected phones
from witnesses.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.844
We scanned videos
and photos of the bombing.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.546
Did you find
any possible targets?

03:00.548 --> 03:02.381
No, but we did see a pattern.
Almost every phone

03:02.383 --> 03:03.815
That we snagged received
two text messages.

03:03.817 --> 03:07.352
First a number
and then a word: "kaboom!"

03:07.354 --> 03:09.454
Did all these phones
have the same text?

03:09.456 --> 03:13.759
But the numbers on all
the phones are different.
Krumitz: Yeah, we arranged

03:13.761 --> 03:15.961
<i>Them from highest to lowest,</i>
<i>like a countdown.</i>

03:15.963 --> 03:17.696
Hey, guys,

03:17.698 --> 03:19.298
These phones are from
inside the theater

03:19.300 --> 03:24.536
But all the numbers
were under 100.
All right, if the low numbers

03:24.538 --> 03:27.472
Were in the theater and those
closest to the explosion

03:27.474 --> 03:28.740
Were the highest,

03:28.742 --> 03:30.275
Then the tablet was counting up.

03:30.277 --> 03:31.610
This is crowdsourcing.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.278
<i>Every time the tablet</i>

03:33.280 --> 03:35.514
<i>Connected to a phone,</i>
<i>the number ticked up.</i>

03:35.516 --> 03:38.483
Ryan: <i>So the target used cell</i>
<i>phones to detonate the bomb.</i>

03:41.554 --> 03:43.989
When did you arrive
at the theater, mrs. Carter?

03:43.991 --> 03:45.958
We were late getting here.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.893
My son was upset

03:47.895 --> 03:50.662
Because he was
missing the previews.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.631
When did you receive
the first text?

03:52.633 --> 03:56.335
<i>Sam ran ahead to buy</i>
<i>the tickets and I went back</i>

03:56.337 --> 03:58.437
<i>To the car to grab a sweater.</i>
<i>It's a bomb, get away!</i>

03:58.439 --> 04:00.639
Move! Get away! It's a bomb!
Carter:
<i>That's when I saw the 200.</i>

04:00.641 --> 04:02.474
And then you received
the "kaboom!" text.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.675
Yes.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.744
When the explosion happened...

04:05.746 --> 04:08.347
I was near the car.

04:08.349 --> 04:11.550
And sam was
much closer to the...

04:14.654 --> 04:17.623
And now he's dead.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.725
The officer
that I spoke with

04:19.727 --> 04:22.761
Said that the 200 was
the last text that was sent out.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.264
Back away, back away!
Carter: <i>Means my phone</i>
<i>set off that bomb.</i>

04:25.266 --> 04:27.733
(explosion)
<i>I have to live with that.</i>

04:29.869 --> 04:31.837
My phone killed
all those people.

04:34.741 --> 04:35.874
It killed my son.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.044
Mrs. Carter...

04:39.046 --> 04:41.346
No, this is not your fault.

04:42.915 --> 04:44.783
(sighs, sniffles)

04:45.918 --> 04:48.820
I still haven't told my husband.

04:48.822 --> 04:52.057
I have to call
my husband.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.926
Of course.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.011
Wait, I thought we were
reassembling the bomb.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.579
We are.
Before we reassemble

05:14.581 --> 05:16.315
We got to find
the bomb parts first,

05:16.317 --> 05:18.850
Which means we need to pick out
every piece of shrapnel

05:18.852 --> 05:20.919
From all the debris
collected at the scene.

05:27.593 --> 05:29.861
And you really think we're gonna
find the tablet's hard drive

05:29.863 --> 05:32.064
In all of this stuff?
No matter
how powerful the blast,

05:32.066 --> 05:33.865
Bombs don't disintegrate.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.534
Usually you recover
all the pieces.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.868
Yeah.
I'm hitting a wall

05:36.870 --> 05:38.837
With these victims' phones.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.405
Turns out our
target anticipated

05:40.407 --> 05:41.840
We'd figure out
the tablet was the one

05:41.842 --> 05:43.008
That sent the "kaboom!" texts,

05:43.010 --> 05:44.976
So he protected himself.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.111
I mean, usually the tablet

05:46.113 --> 05:47.746
Would leave digital dust
on each phone,

05:47.748 --> 05:50.916
<i>And follow it back</i>
<i>to the target.</i>

05:50.918 --> 05:52.417
But we can't.

05:52.419 --> 05:55.687
Because every "kaboom!" text

05:55.689 --> 05:58.590
Was bundled with malware
that wiped the pairing record.

05:58.592 --> 06:02.127
<i>It's like a footprint being</i>
<i>compromised at a crime scene.</i>

06:02.129 --> 06:03.895
The hard drive isn't here.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.866
Too bad we can't
go back in time

06:07.868 --> 06:11.770
Where all the teeny-tiny
pieces went.

06:11.772 --> 06:16.041
Krumitz... Send all the media
you have to the cave.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.583
(wry chuckle) this is cyber
division's big, secret weapon?

06:24.585 --> 06:26.852
Just sit back and watch, here.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.086
Cave, tablet control.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.991
All right, you ready?

06:32.993 --> 06:34.760
Yeah. Security footage,
crime scene photos

06:34.762 --> 06:36.161
And pictures from
the victims' phones

06:36.163 --> 06:37.662
Are locked and loaded.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.731
Have the computer
pull it all up.
Yup.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.737
Good. All right, run the
3-d stitch program.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.141
Wow.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.642
Okay.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.144
Add the bomb blast plume,

06:52.146 --> 06:54.413
Eliminating
human carnage.

06:57.483 --> 07:00.719
Guys, guys.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.487
Damn, that was real.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.089
Mundo:
Okay.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.559
Let's find this hard drive.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.627
Yeah.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.134
Right here.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.570
That's the
hard drive.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.571
Good.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.473
Let's see where it lands.

07:21.475 --> 07:22.507
Krumitz, advance
the explosion.

07:22.509 --> 07:25.677
Um... I can't.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.913
The photos and the video
that we compiled only take us up

07:27.915 --> 07:29.581
To the moment the bomb exploded.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.516
After that, it's just
bits and pieces of data.

07:31.518 --> 07:32.818
Okay, so we know the hard drive

07:32.820 --> 07:34.519
Was propelled
in this direction, right?

07:34.521 --> 07:35.620
Mm-hmm.
And we also know

07:35.622 --> 07:37.756
Eventually,
it would have to land.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.691
Means it's somewhere
further down the alley.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.159
Yeah, but we collected every
of bit shrapnel from the alley

07:41.161 --> 07:44.696
Then something interrupted
the course of its trajectory,

07:44.698 --> 07:47.499
So, krumitz, run a line from
the point of the bomb blast

07:47.501 --> 07:49.835
Through the hard drive
and advance the alley toward us.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.737
Okay, the flight path
of the hard drive takes us

07:52.739 --> 07:55.140
Right into these two people--
this is about where

07:55.142 --> 07:56.641
It would have landed,
right about there.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.009
Good work.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.078
Send me a still of the hard
drive's final position.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.681
I'm gonna find out
who those two vics are.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.082
Krummy...

08:04.084 --> 08:05.784
I was thinking
after we catch that bomber,

08:05.786 --> 08:07.686
Maybe me and you can
come back here

08:07.688 --> 08:08.954
And play that new
first-person shooter.

08:08.956 --> 08:12.824
I got first.
(chuckles)

08:12.826 --> 08:15.193
Hey...

08:15.195 --> 08:17.262
Krummy?

08:18.197 --> 08:19.631
Krummy!

08:21.234 --> 08:22.868
Coroner:
<i>I believe these</i>

08:22.870 --> 08:24.936
Are the two victims
you're looking for.

08:27.573 --> 08:30.976
Both suffered injuries
in the bomb blast.

08:38.651 --> 08:40.819
(grunts)

08:43.756 --> 08:45.824
There's the hard drive.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.642
Thank you.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.278
(sighs) I can't shake
this mrs. Carter story.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.613
Yeah, outliving your
kid is tragic enough,

09:08.615 --> 09:09.948
But thinking
you killed him?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.850
There's no words
for that.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.119
So... M.E.'s office called.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.721
They finally I.D.'d
the rest of the bodies.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.757
Now, two were
congressional staffers.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.593
I'm being asked if I think
they were targeted.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.595
There's no way our target
could've been certain

09:23.597 --> 09:25.263
Who would be near
the blast when it blew.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.066
They're just
wrong place, wrong time.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.168
How we coming on
that target profile?
I compiled

09:30.170 --> 09:33.672
A list of our target's tactic,
techniques, and procedures,

09:33.674 --> 09:35.707
Like using a wireless
device as a trigger.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.876
There are nine dossiers

09:37.878 --> 09:40.011
In the fbi
database that fit.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.212
Three are dead and one

09:41.214 --> 09:42.814
Is serving a
life sentence.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.816
Eyewitnesses said
that the bomb was made

09:44.818 --> 09:46.785
Out of a shoebox
and duct tape.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.087
So bombers are monogamous
with their materials.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.724
Older materials suggests
someone over 35.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.694
And then
there were two.
The one on the left

09:55.696 --> 09:58.296
Is currently under surveillance
in san antonio.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.599
The other's been off the grid
for over a year.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.734
That is our target.
No name, no photo.

10:02.736 --> 10:06.605
We know that he detonated a bomb
in Italy and another in France.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.073
And now, here in the states.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.241
Hey, you guys got to
check out this web site.

10:10.243 --> 10:13.211
It's trending like crazy
on togglefly, friendagenda--

10:13.213 --> 10:15.880
It is everywhere.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.049
Who's behind this?
We don't know.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.285
Metadata's been scrubbed.
It's a dead end.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.287
Scrambled voice: You are
responsible for this bombing.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.122
You could've prevented it

10:24.124 --> 10:25.624
If you'd just
left your cell phone at home.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.626
Your addiction to technology

10:27.628 --> 10:29.294
Is going to kill you.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.630
And now for another lesson.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.065
When this web site gets
one million viewers,

10:34.067 --> 10:36.234
A second bomb will explode.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.736
Ryan:
Our target

10:37.738 --> 10:39.638
Is using page views
on a web site

10:39.640 --> 10:41.006
To make the public responsible

10:41.008 --> 10:42.407
For the next explosion.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.010
The site was uploaded
a few hours ago.

10:45.012 --> 10:48.279
Has already 460,000 views
and counting.

10:48.281 --> 10:52.017
The video starts playing
the moment you access the site.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.418
We have to pull it down now.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.919
We've tried to hack it.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.721
The firewall is too robust.
We're working on it.

10:56.723 --> 10:57.789
Well, work faster.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.424
That url cannot remain online.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.326
Let's find out
where this site

11:01.328 --> 11:04.029
Is being physically hosted,
and have an fbi intrusion squad

11:04.031 --> 11:06.898
At the ready, in case
we got to hit a building

11:06.900 --> 11:08.400
And unplug a server here.

11:08.402 --> 11:10.235
Meantime, we've got
to alert the public

11:10.237 --> 11:15.173
No, no, no. Simon,
an alert will only
pique interest

11:15.175 --> 11:17.409
And drive people to
view the footage.

11:17.411 --> 11:18.943
Look how many views
we already have.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.413
This is mass
cyber voyeurism.

11:21.415 --> 11:23.982
They are visiting that site
because they don't understand

11:23.984 --> 11:26.217
This is not a joke,
and it's not a game.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.319
And every view brings us
one step closer

11:28.321 --> 11:30.422
To a blast site
and a body count.

11:30.424 --> 11:32.424
Clearly, our target

11:32.426 --> 11:34.693
Understands social
media addicts.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.128
People who are compelled
to go to the site, thinking,

11:37.130 --> 11:40.432
"if I'm viewer
500,000 or 600,000,

11:40.434 --> 11:43.435
"or 900,000, there
are no consequences.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.437
"all that matters is
the one millionth view,

11:45.439 --> 11:47.739
So why not see
what's trending?"

11:47.741 --> 11:51.242
Avery, I get
the psychology, I do,

11:51.244 --> 11:52.844
But we cannot just sit by

11:52.846 --> 11:54.979
And watch that counter
keep ticking up.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.981
By making that announcement,
we can stretch it...

11:56.983 --> 11:58.950
No, the announcement

11:58.952 --> 12:00.418
Will not just
alert the public.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.020
It will alert the target.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.857
And there could be very
real repercussions.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.492
What do you suggest?

12:07.494 --> 12:11.429
We need to find a way to break
through that site's firewall.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.431
Then, you better get
moving here, avery,

12:13.433 --> 12:16.167
'cause human curiosity puts us
on an unpredictable clock.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.269
We got no way
of knowing when or where

12:18.271 --> 12:19.771
That bomb is gonna explode.

12:30.850 --> 12:37.055
â™ª I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise â™ª

12:38.924 --> 12:44.496
â™ª I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes â™ª

12:44.498 --> 12:48.867
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

12:48.869 --> 12:52.203
â™ª I can see for miles
and miles â™ª

12:52.205 --> 12:56.541
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

12:56.543 --> 13:00.245
â™ª and miles...

13:00.247 --> 13:02.313
â™ª oh, yeah.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.528
Guys, were you able
to break through the firewall

13:16.530 --> 13:18.163
That's shielding
crowdbomber.Com?

13:18.165 --> 13:20.098
No, still working on it.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.801
Target's web site's protected by
a legendary hardening package.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.335
It's not just one firewall.
It's ten.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.337
Whoever set this up
has mad skills.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.340
Well, can you recode it
and get in?
No.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.942
Hacking won't get us in.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.577
We need the user name
and password

13:32.579 --> 13:33.945
To get beyond this page.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.180
And the only person
who has that is...

13:35.182 --> 13:37.882
The target.

13:37.884 --> 13:41.452
I've seen this symbol before.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.889
<i>You're about to make</i>
<i>the best decision of your life.</i>

13:44.891 --> 13:49.260
The fbi pulled six of us hackers
out of that house last month.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.196
Some of my pals
are crazy talented,

13:51.198 --> 13:54.132
And they're sitting in jail,
and I'm sitting here.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.000
'cause you're not
like the others.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.838
Come work with me in cyber.

14:01.941 --> 14:04.008
Tobin...

14:04.010 --> 14:05.610
Are you in?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.879
(sighs)

14:10.115 --> 14:12.183
Well, working for the fbi means

14:12.185 --> 14:15.220
That you no longer
have any secrets.

14:15.222 --> 14:18.156
I need you
to unlock your computer.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.391
(sighs)

14:32.004 --> 14:34.939
Tobin. Tobin has something
to do with this.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.214
Two years, three months,

14:43.216 --> 14:44.649
Six days--

14:44.651 --> 14:46.484
That's how long it's been

14:46.486 --> 14:48.620
Since I've seen
special agent avery ryan.

14:52.091 --> 14:54.125
I'm chasing a bomber.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.127
He's already
used cell phones

14:56.129 --> 14:58.029
In a movie theater
to detonate a bomb,

14:58.031 --> 14:59.464
And now,
he's using page count views

14:59.466 --> 15:01.199
On a web site
to detonate another.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.234
Right down to it.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.970
Honestly, I'd love to help.

15:05.972 --> 15:08.373
I'm just not sure
how this relates to me.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.109
You sold him hardening software.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.144
Code that he used
to fortify his site.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.480
Made it impossible
for us to hack.

15:15.482 --> 15:18.116
You sure that was mine?

15:18.118 --> 15:21.686
I recognized the log-in screen.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.688
Ah.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.090
You always were so observant.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.993
You know, I think I may
remember to whom you refer.

15:28.995 --> 15:32.096
But I haven't talked
to that guy in years.

15:32.098 --> 15:36.267
You sure you're not working
with this bit of a wacko now?

15:36.269 --> 15:38.269
No.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.205
Not my type of black hat.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.010
If we don't stop this target,
more lives will be lost.

15:46.012 --> 15:48.379
Well, we both know

15:48.381 --> 15:50.315
You need my help,
and we both know

15:50.317 --> 15:53.351
You're not gonna get it for
free, so, here's the deal:

15:53.353 --> 15:55.620
I want access
to the prison library.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.121
As you must remember,

15:57.123 --> 15:59.023
I'm kind of a voracious reader.

16:00.192 --> 16:01.693
I can't even get a smile?

16:03.529 --> 16:05.163
How about this, tobin?

16:05.165 --> 16:07.031
No deal on the table.

16:07.033 --> 16:10.034
You'll help me, or I'll transfer
the six latin kings

16:10.036 --> 16:12.403
You're paying to protect you
into another prison.

16:14.340 --> 16:17.442
Can't I even get a smile?

16:29.488 --> 16:32.123
That's not a log-in
and password.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.624
No, that's not a log-in
and password.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.560
That's an address
to my deep web site

16:35.562 --> 16:39.130
Where I keep all of my exploits
and what you're looking for.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.667
You can't remember
your password?

16:42.669 --> 16:45.136
Are you serious? Do you have
any idea how many exploits

16:45.138 --> 16:47.171
These babies have created?
Countless.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.441
Oh, uh, one last thing,
kind of important.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.044
Tell your new hacker pet,
brody nelson,

16:53.046 --> 16:55.146
To be real careful
when he visits the site.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.715
I hear he's quite good, but
then again, this malware is

16:57.717 --> 17:01.085
Some of my most aggressive.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.722
(lock buzzes)

17:06.358 --> 17:08.459
Go this web site.
It's tobin's.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.161
Be careful.
It'll be crawling with malware.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.262
All right, I'll
use a computer

17:11.264 --> 17:15.233
Well, somewhere on his site is
the admin log-in and password...

17:15.235 --> 17:16.801
Mm-hmm.
To unlock crowdbomber.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.237
Find it fast,
pull it down now.
I'm on it.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.539
Did I hear right?
You visited tobin?

17:21.541 --> 17:25.243
I did. Tobin wrote software that
our target is currently using

17:25.245 --> 17:27.245
To throw us off the trail.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.214
Which still doesn't mean
you need to involve him in this.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.183
Well, leave no stone unturned.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.518
It's fine; seriously.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.153
I got him to help.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.189
If it went fine,
why do you look so upset?

17:38.191 --> 17:42.460
I brought him into the fbi
to try to change a life,

17:42.462 --> 17:44.195
And now, he's in prison.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.397
You know, avery,
some people have the tools

17:46.399 --> 17:48.466
To make the right choice,
like raven.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.635
She knew we were
the best thing that ever

17:50.637 --> 17:52.403
Happened to her.

17:52.405 --> 17:56.774
Others can't be saved, 'cause
others are just plain evil.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.243
Hoped you'd see that by now.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.482
Mundo:
<i>I got an idea.</i>

18:04.484 --> 18:06.717
We need to divert viewers from
the original crowdbomber site

18:06.719 --> 18:08.653
To about 50 other pages
with the same video.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.222
Pages that are not linked to
a bomb that's still out there.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.824
Is that doable?
It's doable.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.192
It's just gonna
take a long time

18:14.194 --> 18:16.094
To make 50 exact
clones of the web site.

18:16.096 --> 18:20.298
Once people view the video
on a... On a similar format,

18:20.300 --> 18:22.400
Hopefully, that'll satisfy
their need to go watch it.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.168
I'll call the search engines,
get 'em to move our cloned sites

18:24.170 --> 18:25.436
Up to the top
of their results page.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.271
Burying the real site--
hella clever.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.539
Yeah, I have my moments.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.108
Just figure
if we spread out traffic,

18:30.110 --> 18:31.642
It'll give us some time
to find the bomb.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.444
Got it.

18:47.159 --> 18:50.528
Krummy, avery said be careful
accessing tobin's site.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.830
I didn't think she meant
level-5 cdc-biohazard careful.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.866
Look at that-- even the malware
has got malware.

18:54.868 --> 18:57.268
Okay, locating the admin
log-in and password.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.203
Downloading that right now.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.873
Oh, my god, you got
to be kidding me.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.908
Krumitz: Tobin encrypted
the log-in screen?

19:03.910 --> 19:05.276
Dude is playing games.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.145
No, he's trying to
make avery dance.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.313
The sicko gets a perverted sense
of pleasure from one-upping her.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.782
Everybody talks about this
dude like he's the devil.

19:11.784 --> 19:15.319
Tobin betrayed avery by trying
to sell confidential fbi intel

19:15.321 --> 19:16.854
To the bad guys she was chasing.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.356
Nobody saw
his double-cross coming?

19:18.358 --> 19:20.892
Mundo: Tobin was the first
black hat she rescued.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.660
Avery handpicked him. She saw
something special in him.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.362
We trusted him
because she did.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.831
Tobin knew avery had a soft spot
for him, and he played her.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.566
(computer trilling)
tell me that's the
bomb's hard drive.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.401
It is.
I was able to rebuild it

19:30.403 --> 19:31.836
And pull off the unique
I.D. Number.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.738
I used it to track the tablet's

19:33.740 --> 19:36.841
Movement from the theater back
to where it was first turned on.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.342
Could be where the bomber lives.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.844
Send me the gps coordinates.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.546
See what I'm
talking about?

19:41.548 --> 19:44.582
Why's he pounding you?
I'm the one who found it.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.664
Clear!
Clear!

19:59.666 --> 20:01.933
Clear!

20:11.476 --> 20:14.612
Digital voice:
When I'm done, the world
will fear their cell phone,

20:14.614 --> 20:18.849
Fear social media,
fear their crushing addiction.

20:18.851 --> 20:22.587
Because you interfered with
my plan, this is my response.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.988
Instead of a million views,

20:23.990 --> 20:26.290
The bomb will now detonate
at 750,000.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.960
People will die... Soon,

20:28.962 --> 20:30.394
And you only have yourself
to blame.

20:30.396 --> 20:33.297
Bomb! Bomb! Everybody out!

20:35.267 --> 20:37.768
I hope you all enjoy
my surprise.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.606
(man grunts)

20:43.875 --> 20:46.611
(groaning)

20:46.613 --> 20:47.778
Mundo:
Medic up!

20:47.780 --> 20:50.348
(groaning)
medic!

20:56.888 --> 20:58.489
Sifter:
Raven's mirror sites
have slowed the traffic,

20:58.491 --> 20:59.857
But word has gotten out.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.826
Now that the target's
lowered the trigger number,

21:01.828 --> 21:03.628
The bomb could blow
up before midnight.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.696
Yeah, and still not closer
to finding dr. Frankenstein

21:05.698 --> 21:07.365
Or his monster.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.367
Okay, he hits
a movie theater here.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.868
Library in paris.

21:10.870 --> 21:14.405
I mean, it's like the target's
trying to make his pattern

21:14.407 --> 21:15.973
Look completely random.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.642
But it's not completely random.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.910
For him, it's about victims.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.413
This target...

21:22.415 --> 21:24.615
Is interested in maximizing
the amount of victims

21:24.617 --> 21:28.052
By going after...
Large crowds.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.720
(scoffs)
so he could hit anywhere

21:29.722 --> 21:31.455
With lots of people
and lots of phones.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.458
I mean,
the possibilities are endless.
Mundo: The guys and I

21:34.460 --> 21:36.460
Just processed what was left
of the target's laptop.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.430
It's a dead end. There's nothing
on that hard drive.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.765
So that's it.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.500
I mean, no more options.

21:42.502 --> 21:45.369
No. There's one more.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.771
Tobin.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.773
Mundo:
Come on, avery.

21:48.775 --> 21:49.974
Tobin is playing games.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.976
But if we want
to shut down that site,

21:51.978 --> 21:53.511
We have to play along

21:53.513 --> 21:54.779
<i>So he'll give us</i>
<i>the encryption key</i>

21:54.781 --> 21:56.314
<i>To get past the log-in screen.</i>

21:56.316 --> 21:58.349
Sifter: <i>All right,</i>
<i>all right, all right.</i>

21:58.351 --> 22:00.584
Let's say we do play along.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.720
What does tobin want?

22:03.789 --> 22:05.356
Tell your new hacker pet,
brody nelson,

22:05.358 --> 22:07.558
To be real careful
when he visits the site.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.493
He wants to spend
a little quality time

22:09.495 --> 22:12.396
With a member of our cyber team.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.398
(lock buzzes)

22:14.400 --> 22:18.002
Tobin: So this is
brody nelson.

22:18.004 --> 22:22.473
This is the new tobin. Hmm.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.675
Yeah, can I be honest?
Not really what I expected.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.410
You sure this one's
to be trusted?

22:26.412 --> 22:28.746
She knows this one's
to be trusted.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.548
No more games, tobin.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.417
I'm just surprised sifter
let you keep the party going.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.086
Trust a black hat once,
shame on them.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.088
Trust a black hat twice...

22:37.090 --> 22:39.423
How long do you think you can
deny the thirst, nelson?

22:39.425 --> 22:41.926
You have no idea how much money
can be made selling the secrets

22:41.928 --> 22:43.461
At your fingertips.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.528
But I do.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.796
And how's that working out
for you?

22:45.798 --> 22:47.798
You like your new
living situation?

22:47.800 --> 22:50.401
Concrete walls,

22:50.403 --> 22:53.404
Shackled up,
zero computer access?

22:53.406 --> 22:55.740
Seeing how much your life sucks
only makes me more confident

22:55.742 --> 22:57.575
That I will never become you.

22:57.577 --> 22:58.909
Ryan: You know
why I'm here.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.579
The moment you sent me
to that site.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.147
Now give me the...
Patience, avery.
We will get

23:03.149 --> 23:05.683
To the encryption key.
But, right now, though...

23:05.685 --> 23:07.151
I want
to know nelson's hacker handle.

23:07.153 --> 23:10.988
You give me that key or I'm
gonna make your life miserable.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.924
Hacker handle.

23:17.162 --> 23:20.531
Quest.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.500
Let's play
"get to know you" later.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.534
Clock is ticking.

23:23.536 --> 23:24.835
You crashed commerceticker.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.837
Yeah, that was me.

23:26.839 --> 23:31.876
You must know free4all.
Of course I do.
Dude's ridiculously skilled.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.578
Yeah, free's friendagenda
tabnabbing exploit
was top-shelf.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.847
Yeah, and adding a "your session
has timed out" page was genius.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.583
I hear he went after
friendagenda because
they banned him for life.

23:39.585 --> 23:40.551
Yeah, well,
that's the word on the wire.

23:40.553 --> 23:43.087
All right, avery.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.755
I'll let you in.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.557
Mm.

23:46.559 --> 23:50.060
Uh, under one
condition, though.

23:50.062 --> 23:53.597
I get to type
the encryption key myself.

23:54.566 --> 23:56.600
You want to type?

23:59.671 --> 24:02.673
Type into a text file.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.575
No internet.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.115
(shuddering breath)

24:12.451 --> 24:15.453
I haven't touched a keyboard
in years.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.521
(exhales passionately)

24:22.661 --> 24:24.728
(sighs)

24:31.803 --> 24:34.672
This should give us access
to crowdbomber.Com.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.840
Okay, krummy.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.875
Voila. You're in.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.810
So how long
before the site comes down?

24:39.812 --> 24:41.545
Just need to get
onto the host server

24:41.547 --> 24:43.647
And delete the web site's files.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.649
Just give me one second.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.017
And...

24:47.019 --> 24:49.620
Nelson: Wait, wait, wait!
Krummy-- stop typing!

24:49.622 --> 24:52.223
Scroll up
to the last subroutine.

24:52.225 --> 24:54.592
Tell me I'm crazy,
but isn't that...

24:54.594 --> 24:56.260
Krumitz:
It's a dead-man switch.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.995
Mundo: Wait, like the kind
that triggers a bomb

24:57.997 --> 24:59.930
If the human operator
is incapacitated?

24:59.932 --> 25:01.799
Nelson:
Exactly like that.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.701
Except this is
the digital version.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.103
If we alter any code,
if we delete html files,

25:06.105 --> 25:08.138
If we try
to disable the bomb remotely...

25:08.140 --> 25:10.207
Boom.
Wait, wait.
Is there a work-around?

25:10.209 --> 25:12.076
Just make the bomb think
it already exploded.

25:12.078 --> 25:15.679
I can't even alter one character
on a single line of code.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.148
I have never seen anything
this sophisticated.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.618
(sighs) so we're back
to a manhunt again.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.620
Hey, krummy, take a look
at this code.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.288
It was just added
four hours ago.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.090
Yeah, that's right.
When the target adjusted

25:26.092 --> 25:28.559
The trigger threshold
down to 750k.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.794
See, this, ladies and gentlemen,
is what you call a mistake.

25:30.796 --> 25:32.630
See, he didn't count on us

25:32.632 --> 25:34.298
Unlocking
his hardening software,

25:34.300 --> 25:36.300
So he didn't anonymize
the computer he used

25:36.302 --> 25:37.568
To alter the code.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.270
Can you trace it?

25:39.272 --> 25:41.539
Does nelson's tie
match his socks?

25:41.541 --> 25:43.107
(chuckles)

25:43.109 --> 25:44.141
That's a yes.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.276
(both laughing)

25:45.278 --> 25:46.677
Elijah, you want
to meet our bomber?

25:49.314 --> 25:50.814
Mundo:
I'll get a tac unit.

25:52.150 --> 25:53.817
High fi...

25:53.819 --> 25:55.119
Yeah! High...

25:55.121 --> 25:56.687
Krumitz...

26:07.066 --> 26:09.767
Stop! Stop!
Fbi! Hands up!

26:09.769 --> 26:11.702
Stop right there!
Drop it! Drop it!

26:11.704 --> 26:14.939
You don't want to do that.
There are children next door.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.106
Shut your mouth.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.576
I swear...
People have to know the truth,

26:18.578 --> 26:20.744
And I'm gonna be the one
to show them the truth.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.646
They're gonna know the truth
and you're gonna show them.

26:22.648 --> 26:24.114
And I'm gonna help.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.249
What's your name?

26:25.251 --> 26:26.984
My name...

26:26.986 --> 26:28.052
What's your name?

26:28.054 --> 26:29.653
My name is miles jensen.

26:29.655 --> 26:33.657
Why don't you...
People have to know
that we are a society

26:33.659 --> 26:36.660
Addicted to technology,
to social media.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.195
No one sees it.
You don't see it.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.731
I'm the only one who's paying
attention to what we've become.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.600
Well, you've got
our attention, miles,

26:42.602 --> 26:46.103
But you need to put down
that detonator before we...

26:46.105 --> 26:47.705
Don't tell me what to do!

26:47.707 --> 26:51.675
These people need
to be stopped, and I am

26:51.677 --> 26:53.677
The only one who can do it.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.679
They didn't listen before.

26:55.681 --> 26:57.715
But they're gonna listen now.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.383
I'm listening to you, miles.
I'm listening to you right now.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.852
What I'm telling you,
if you let that bomb

27:01.854 --> 27:03.721
You linked
to the web site go off,

27:03.723 --> 27:07.157
Nobody is going to care
what you have to say.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.727
Tell me where the bomb is,
and we could...

27:09.729 --> 27:10.894
Too late!
It's not too late.

27:10.896 --> 27:12.363
It <i>is</i> too late!
Miles!

27:12.365 --> 27:13.931
Put down
the detonator!
You shouldn't have come here.

27:13.933 --> 27:17.067
Miles, stay with me,
all right?

27:17.069 --> 27:19.203
Now I have to take you all
with me.
No.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.171
Miles...

27:21.173 --> 27:22.406
M-mil...
Look at me.

27:22.408 --> 27:23.774
You think
they're gonna listen now?

27:23.776 --> 27:25.042
Stay with me-- miles!

27:37.422 --> 27:40.424
(auto-dial beeping)

27:40.426 --> 27:42.793
Avery,
is the counter still running?

27:42.795 --> 27:44.762
698,000...

27:44.764 --> 27:46.230
698,001.

27:47.766 --> 27:49.233
Elijah,
we're running out of time.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.114
Elijah, you didn't
have a choice.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.150
You and your swat team
were in harm's way.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.285
You made the right call.
Did I?

28:08.287 --> 28:10.354
He was the only one who
knew where the bomb was.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.989
The answer we needed
died with him.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.324
We're gonna find that bomb.
Nelson and krumitz are working

28:14.326 --> 28:17.461
Right now on how that web site
triggers the explosion.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.196
We got it! We got it!

28:19.198 --> 28:20.464
Internet relay chat, baby!

28:20.466 --> 28:22.900
Irc is an application
layer protocol

28:22.902 --> 28:25.102
That facilitates data transfer
in the form of text.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.337
Krumitz, some of us
don't speak robot.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.306
It's a private message service.
All right.

28:29.308 --> 28:33.811
Indirect communication.
Mundo: Then let's indirectly
communicate with the bomb

28:33.813 --> 28:36.480
And find its location.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.482
Gentlemen, is there
something you want to share

28:38.484 --> 28:40.350
With the class?
There's a password.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.352
And I killed the only guy
who knows it.
Yep.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.488
Can't you guys
just hack the irc?

28:44.490 --> 28:46.423
Absolutely. If we had
a few dozen skilled coders

28:46.425 --> 28:47.391
And about a year.

28:48.359 --> 28:51.028
Wait a minute.

28:53.832 --> 28:56.500
Mmm! I knew
that encryption coding

28:56.502 --> 28:59.069
On the internet relay chat
channel looked familiar.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.071
Tobin wrote it.
Must have sold it to the bomber

29:01.073 --> 29:02.439
When he sold
the hardening software.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.474
Ryan:
Damn it.

29:03.476 --> 29:06.944
I'm sorry-- simon,
I have to go back. Nelson...

29:06.946 --> 29:08.178
Yes?
You're with me.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.415
We need that password
to find the bomb.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.784
Avery, we need to talk.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.786
There's nothing
to talk about.
Oh, yeah, there is.

29:15.788 --> 29:16.820
Avery!

29:19.791 --> 29:21.425
That tobin is clearly
up to something.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.426
You can't trust him.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.228
I don't.
That's not what this is.

29:24.230 --> 29:27.498
This is about tobin getting
what <i>he</i> wants.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.833
And you know what?
He's good at it.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.969
He's crafty, but I'm better.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.004
Yeah, and I believe
that you're better.

29:34.006 --> 29:37.875
Now, look, tobin is
dangerous for you, all right?

29:37.877 --> 29:41.378
So just stop going back
to him and let him go.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.514
I will.

29:43.516 --> 29:46.116
As soon as I get what I need.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.286
As soon as we find that bomb.

29:52.991 --> 29:56.326
Library duty,
like you requested.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.228
Now you can open
the irc channel,

29:58.230 --> 29:59.897
So we can find the bomb.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.866
Everything seems to be in order.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.368
Uh...

30:04.370 --> 30:06.370
The password is...

30:06.372 --> 30:08.105
One word:

30:08.107 --> 30:10.007
Averyryan. Capital "a,"

30:10.009 --> 30:11.441
Capital "r."

30:13.444 --> 30:15.979
All right, I'm sending it
to krumitz now.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.187
(gasping):
Help. Help.

30:23.189 --> 30:26.089
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.391
(gasping)

30:27.393 --> 30:30.060
Guard.
Guard:
I'll get another inhaler.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.263
(gasping)

30:39.904 --> 30:42.506
(breathing
deeply, slowly)

30:44.108 --> 30:47.110
You could've just let me die.

30:47.112 --> 30:49.847
We might still need you.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.149
Send that password to krumitz.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.551
Okay.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.420
(panting)

30:56.422 --> 30:57.487
Done.

31:01.392 --> 31:03.327
Krumitz:
Okay, the irc channel's open,

31:03.329 --> 31:05.929
And now we're tracing the bomb.
These are the last three

31:05.931 --> 31:07.965
Cell towers the bomb's
detonation tablet connected to.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.466
Using the signal strength,

31:09.468 --> 31:12.502
I can tell you that bomb is
somewhere in that square mile.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.205
Sifter: Yeah, a needle
in a square-mile haystack.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.506
Could be anywhere.
No, not anywhere.

31:16.508 --> 31:20.611
We better think fast-- we just
passed 725,000 page views.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.346
Ryan:
We know that he believed

31:22.348 --> 31:25.415
That technology and social media
were the downfall of humanity.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.950
Yeah, and to save humanity,

31:26.952 --> 31:28.952
He wanted to kill
as many people as possible.

31:28.954 --> 31:30.988
What about the convention
center? Isn't there a
tech conference going on?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.556
That was last month.
Nelson: Football stadium's
right there,

31:32.558 --> 31:33.957
But no one plays on a Tuesday.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.158
Nelson, do me a favor--
run a search

31:35.160 --> 31:37.160
On all the events
in dc tonight--

31:37.162 --> 31:38.896
Anything that could draw
a large crowd.
Okay.

31:40.031 --> 31:42.032
Ramirez: Vine club's
cohosting an event

31:42.034 --> 31:43.333
Tonight with aov mobile.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.401
The cellular company.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.570
Ryan:
That's it-- big crowd,

31:46.572 --> 31:48.338
Lots of cell phones,
fits our bomber's mo.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.408
Adjusting the trigger
to 750,000 wasn't arbitrary.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.343
He wanted to insure would
explode at the show tonight.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.012
It's already started.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.613
Krumitz, you're with me.

31:59.017 --> 32:01.551
â™ª

32:13.431 --> 32:17.034
Ryan: Elijah, we just passed
730,000 views.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.937
Avery, it's packed in here!

32:19.939 --> 32:22.039
It's not gonna be easy
to find the bomb.

32:22.041 --> 32:25.008
Everyone at the concert is
recording it with their phones.

32:25.010 --> 32:28.478
The target was counting on that.
He wants that explosion posted.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.048
That's how he
spreads his message.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.283
Where's the one place
you can guarantee

32:33.285 --> 32:35.686
All the cameras will be pointed?

32:35.688 --> 32:38.288
The stage.
Start looking
for the bomb there.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.657
I'm on it.

32:50.034 --> 32:52.035
Yo, cut the music, cut it.

32:52.037 --> 32:53.170
Get these people out of here.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.237
Hands away, back up.

32:54.239 --> 32:56.740
(music stops, crowd booing)

32:56.742 --> 32:58.175
Dj:
Hey, guys, they're telling us

32:58.177 --> 33:01.712
We've gotta clear out of here.

33:01.714 --> 33:04.214
I don't know what to tell you,
but they've got a badge

33:04.216 --> 33:05.582
And they look important.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.117
Krumitz. Found it.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.421
Nelson just texted.
The web site just passed

33:11.423 --> 33:13.724
735,000 views.
I'm gonna call the bomb squad.

33:13.726 --> 33:16.460
Dj: Sorry about this.
We can't know
they're gonna get here in time.

33:16.462 --> 33:20.263
Dj: If everyone can start
heading for the exits...
Krumitz: Oh, my...

33:20.265 --> 33:22.099
It's at least three times
the size of the bomb

33:22.101 --> 33:24.668
That went off inside
of the theater.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.336
It's not safe
to disarm it in here.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.738
What does that mean?

33:29.774 --> 33:33.043
Shouldn't we just get... Okay.

33:34.779 --> 33:36.780
Krumitz, stay here, I got this.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.515
You can't disarm
a bomb and drive.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.584
I'm coming.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.162
(siren wailing,
tires screeching)

33:54.732 --> 33:57.100
Hey, man,
it's a little hard to type

33:57.102 --> 33:58.702
With you all over the road.
Sorry, krummy.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.037
You want to drive?

34:00.039 --> 34:02.439
Ryan:
Elijah, you're still ten miles

34:02.441 --> 34:04.207
From the first open area.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.509
You're not gonna
make it in time.

34:05.511 --> 34:07.644
We sent the bomb squad
your gps coordinates.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.112
They'll try and meet you
en route.

34:09.114 --> 34:10.747
The bomb squad'll never
get it disarmed in time.

34:10.749 --> 34:13.050
Just passed 740,000, boys.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.084
Krumitz: Okay, I just

34:14.086 --> 34:15.719
Ran a diagnostic on the bomb.

34:15.721 --> 34:19.089
That's the detonator.
I think I can write a script

34:19.091 --> 34:21.625
To just tell the ringer
not to ring.
Nelson: Krumitz, not even you

34:21.627 --> 34:23.093
Can write that much
code from scratch.

34:23.095 --> 34:24.661
You got a better idea, nelson?

34:24.663 --> 34:26.096
Actually, I do.

34:26.098 --> 34:27.297
I saw an exploit
on tobin's site.

34:27.299 --> 34:31.201
Cell phone ringers.
Ramirez: He's gonna need
to update that code,

34:31.203 --> 34:33.737
Adjust it to the tablet.
Yeah, but the framework
should still be the same.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.405
Krumitz, I'm sending it
to you now.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.641
Okay, okay.
This might actually work.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.709
(honking horn)

34:42.814 --> 34:44.381
Ryan:
We just passed

34:44.383 --> 34:46.183
742,000.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.217
Krumitz, did it work?

34:47.219 --> 34:49.086
Nope, nope, definitely

34:49.088 --> 34:50.420
Did not work.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.755
Mundo:
Coding's not gonna save the day,

34:51.757 --> 34:54.224
I want you to get ready
to jump out.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.258
What? Are you insane?
Krumitz,

34:55.260 --> 34:56.660
I want you out of this car now.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.628
That is an order!
The hell it is.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.164
We are in this together.
Now just shut up.

35:05.136 --> 35:06.269
What just happened here?

35:06.271 --> 35:10.173
Oh, god, unbelievable--
someone ddos'd the site.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.742
Ramirez:
743,000 and climbing.

35:12.744 --> 35:15.846
Krumitz, elijah,
get out of that suv now.

35:15.848 --> 35:17.414
We're still in
a populated area.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.349
If we stop driving, people die.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.518
Ryan:
Kill the battery on the tablet.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.752
Listen to me carefully.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.255
An suv's engine
takes a tremendous

35:25.257 --> 35:27.357
Amount of electricity
to turn over.

35:27.359 --> 35:30.393
Wire the tablet's battery
to the car's starter.

35:30.395 --> 35:33.396
That will drain
the tablet's power supply.
Of course. Krumitz,

35:33.398 --> 35:35.298
We got to wire the tablet's
battery into the car's starter.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.134
Hold on.
(tires screech)

35:42.907 --> 35:44.407
Geez!

35:44.409 --> 35:46.176
Told you to hold on.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.288
Sifter:
Passing 749,000.

36:05.429 --> 36:07.397
Hold it?
Yeah.

36:10.368 --> 36:12.235
Elijah! Krumitz!

36:17.341 --> 36:18.808
Krummy?

36:18.810 --> 36:20.177
Krummy, are you alive?

36:21.946 --> 36:24.915
Krumitz, you alive, bro?

36:24.917 --> 36:27.784
Mundo:
We're alive.
(whoops)

36:27.786 --> 36:30.253
Ryan:
Oh... (laughs)

36:30.255 --> 36:31.955
(sifter whoops)

36:31.957 --> 36:33.890
I'm gonna throw up.

36:33.892 --> 36:36.459
(both laughing)

36:36.461 --> 36:39.196
Seriously, take me
home right now.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.864
(both laughing)

36:53.211 --> 36:56.413
Sifter:
<i>You brought a blackhat</i>

36:56.415 --> 36:57.681
<i>Into our inner circle here...</i>

36:57.683 --> 36:59.316
Mundo:
<i>Tobin was another hacker</i>

36:59.318 --> 37:01.218
<i>We all trusted,</i>
<i>who betrayed us.</i>

37:01.220 --> 37:04.254
Sifter:
<i>...Once a blackhat,</i>
<i>always a blackhat.</i>

37:04.256 --> 37:06.223
Tobin:
<i>Wow. (laughs)</i>

37:06.225 --> 37:09.259
<i>This place is huge.</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

37:09.261 --> 37:10.961
What are we doing here,
solving cyber crimes

37:10.963 --> 37:14.631
Or putting on a broadway show?
Either way, you can count me in.

37:14.633 --> 37:18.335
The fbi director finally agreed
cyber needed its own space.

37:18.337 --> 37:19.970
Huh. Only took
three years of jockeying

37:19.972 --> 37:21.771
With major crimes on a bunch of

37:21.773 --> 37:23.340
Antique computers.

37:23.342 --> 37:27.377
You taking that one?
'cause if not, I call dibs.

37:29.313 --> 37:31.481
Hey, I was just...
Just kidding about

37:31.483 --> 37:33.817
The office thing-- I don't...
I don't really need an office.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.826
I wanted you to see this.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.930
I really wanted you to see

37:46.932 --> 37:48.999
Cyber's new home.

37:50.768 --> 37:53.336
But you're never
gonna work here, tobin.

37:53.338 --> 37:55.305
What?

37:55.307 --> 37:56.773
You're under arrest.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.843
What is this, a joke? What am I
under arrest for? Hey! Hey.

37:59.845 --> 38:02.045
You betrayed your country

38:02.047 --> 38:04.047
When you tried to sell

38:04.049 --> 38:06.049
Fbi secrets to criminals

38:06.051 --> 38:07.784
On the deep web.
What?

38:07.786 --> 38:09.886
You are guilty of conspiracy,

38:09.888 --> 38:12.055
Espionage, theft...

38:12.057 --> 38:14.924
I never did
any of that, avery. I...

38:14.926 --> 38:16.559
Tobin, stop! Honestly,

38:16.561 --> 38:18.295
I thought you
had changed.

38:18.297 --> 38:20.330
But I was alone
in that thinking.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.032
You see, the rest of the fbi--

38:22.034 --> 38:23.900
They were just waiting

38:23.902 --> 38:27.037
For you to put
your black hat back on.

38:27.039 --> 38:29.039
Including sifter.

38:29.041 --> 38:31.708
He started
watching you.
What?

38:31.710 --> 38:34.577
He just showed me
definitive proof

38:34.579 --> 38:37.080
That you compromised
the fbi mainframe.

38:37.082 --> 38:41.751
You can't just send me
to jail, 'cause we're a team.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.820
We're not a team!

38:43.822 --> 38:45.555
We never were.

38:47.458 --> 38:49.559
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.428
Oh, no, no, no, no,
please, no, no, no, listen.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.897
I-I made a mistake. One mistake.
But you got to let it slide.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.865
You c... You can't
do this to me, avery.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.068
I'm not doing this
to you, tobin.

38:58.070 --> 38:59.869
You did this to yourself.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.805
Please... Hey, come on,
let go of me. Hey!

39:01.807 --> 39:02.906
Hey, come on! Avery, please.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.841
Hey, avery,
please, hold it...

39:04.843 --> 39:06.776
You can't just
put me in jail, avery.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.978
Avery, come on, now, here now!
Hey, we're a team, avery!

39:08.980 --> 39:10.980
No, come on, guys,
no, no, no, no...

39:12.951 --> 39:16.353
This bad boy's
clean as a whistle.

39:16.355 --> 39:17.620
Wiped it seven times.

39:17.622 --> 39:18.888
No malware could survive
that scrubbing.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.124
Not even malware
as impressive as, uh...

39:21.126 --> 39:22.692
You're impressed with tobin.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.861
That's okay, nelson.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.930
He's incredibly impressive.

39:26.932 --> 39:29.466
I mean, look, I'm not defending
the man or nothing like that,

39:29.468 --> 39:31.601
It's just, those codes, they...

39:31.603 --> 39:32.902
They're good.

39:32.904 --> 39:35.939
He's very talented.
But so are you.

39:35.941 --> 39:38.508
We wouldn't have found
that bomb without you.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.677
We wouldn't have saved
those lives without you.

39:40.679 --> 39:42.045
We're lucky to have you.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.481
Thanks.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.385
There's just
one thing I don't get:

39:48.387 --> 39:51.054
Why was tobin so hung up
on getting library access?

39:51.056 --> 39:53.623
It wasn't like you were gonna
let him near a computer.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.058
He didn't need a computer.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.027
<i>He was gonna use the router</i>
<i>in the librarian's desk</i>

39:58.029 --> 40:01.865
<i>To dump his deep web exploits</i>
<i>onto the mainframe.</i>

40:01.867 --> 40:03.767
I know I walked those exploits

40:03.769 --> 40:05.869
Into that prison on that laptop.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.637
But how was he
gonna get 'em off?

40:07.639 --> 40:08.972
What was he gonna do-- magic?

40:08.974 --> 40:12.041
He was using a near field
communication device.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.611
Yeah, but the guards searched
him right in front of us.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.913
How was he gonna
get an nfc past us?

40:16.915 --> 40:19.449
Ryan:
<i>He created a diversion.</i>

40:19.451 --> 40:21.918
Nelson: <i>The asthma attack.</i>
<i>(scoffs)</i>

40:21.920 --> 40:24.921
<i>The nfc was in his inhaler.</i>

40:24.923 --> 40:26.956
<i>I know I shouldn't</i>
<i>be saying this, but, uh,</i>

40:26.958 --> 40:30.693
Damn, that was
a pretty genius move.

40:30.695 --> 40:33.096
It was pretty genius.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.165
But not genius enough.

40:36.467 --> 40:38.835
Ain't that right.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.882
Oh, by the way,

40:52.884 --> 40:54.884
Special agent avery ryan

40:54.886 --> 40:56.953
Wanted me to give you this.
