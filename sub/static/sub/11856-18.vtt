WEBVTT

00:08.875 --> 00:11.208
I can't do this.

00:11.291 --> 00:13.083
This is insane.

00:13.166 --> 00:15.542
What am I thinking?

00:24.709 --> 00:26.625
I can do this.

00:26.709 --> 00:30.250
I'm as good as the next guy.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.583
(male #1)
'Next.'

00:43.667 --> 00:46.291
(male #2)
'What are you singing?'

00:46.375 --> 00:47.458
"Willkommen."

00:47.542 --> 00:49.291
Of course.

00:49.375 --> 00:51.792
Give me your name, tell me
something about yourself.

00:51.875 --> 00:54.125
Dennis Hofferman.

00:54.208 --> 00:55.792
I'm..

00:55.875 --> 00:57.041
...just a cabdriver.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.709
A singing cabdriver.
That's terrific.

01:00.792 --> 01:02.208
I've never really sang
in public before.

01:02.291 --> 01:06.458
I've...never done anything
like this before.

01:06.542 --> 01:08.959
That's fine.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.709
(Hofferman)
'Sorry.'

01:21.792 --> 01:24.375
Butterflies.

01:24.458 --> 01:27.208
You know what? Um..

01:27.291 --> 01:28.500
...maybe I'll just come back.

01:28.583 --> 01:30.500
No-no-no. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:30.583 --> 01:32.333
Why don't you just turn around

01:32.417 --> 01:34.667
'face the back
of the stage?'

01:34.750 --> 01:36.166
'No prying eyes.'

01:36.250 --> 01:39.834
Just you...alone..

01:39.917 --> 01:42.667
...in your cab.

02:12.500 --> 02:18.250
<i>♪ Im cabaret au cabaret</i>
<i>to cabaret ♪♪</i>

02:24.959 --> 02:27.375
What's taking Dennis so long?
Clinton, go find him.

02:27.458 --> 02:30.458
Tell him we're minutes
away,
for Pete's sake.

02:30.542 --> 02:31.792
Dennis.

02:31.875 --> 02:34.208
Showtime.
Dennis?

03:01.917 --> 03:03.375
'And now..'

03:03.458 --> 03:05.834
<i>'..meine damen und herren,</i>
<i>madames et messieurs.'</i>

03:05.917 --> 03:08.417
Ladies and gentlemen..

03:17.834 --> 03:19.834
- Morning, boss.
- Morning.

03:19.917 --> 03:21.417
(Stillman)
Detectives Rush and Vera.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.542
This is Della
Gardener,
theater owner.

03:23.625 --> 03:24.834
Morning.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.542
Excuse me if I'm still
trembling like a leaf.

03:26.625 --> 03:27.875
It's been a very
upsetting morning.

03:27.959 --> 03:29.792
Stagehands were moving
set furniture

03:29.875 --> 03:31.750
'out of storage,
and they dropped a piece.'

03:31.834 --> 03:33.333
Take it that's not a prop.

03:33.417 --> 03:35.458
No, it's a real live .38.

03:35.542 --> 03:38.750
Mrs. Gardener had bought the
furniture used, a few years
ago.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.041
Got a very good deal on it.

03:40.125 --> 03:41.959
I bet.
Who was the original
owner?

03:42.041 --> 03:43.834
Francisville
Community Theater.

03:43.917 --> 03:45.875
There was an unsolved
murder there in 2002.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.375
Place shut down.

03:47.458 --> 03:49.667
This was the dresser
from the set

03:49.750 --> 03:52.083
of Fraulein Schneider's
Boarding House.

03:54.417 --> 03:56.166
They were doing "Cabaret".

03:58.542 --> 04:00.625
Actor went out for a smoke
before the show.

04:00.709 --> 04:04.041
Was shot and killed
with a .38.

04:04.125 --> 04:05.375
(Stillman)
'Wallet was missing
and there'd been'

04:05.458 --> 04:06.959
a series of holdups
in the area.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.625
But someone off the street
wouldn't have been able

04:08.709 --> 04:12.333
to slip unnoticed onto
the stage...hide the gun.

04:12.417 --> 04:14.083
(Vera)
'So if this gun's
the murder weapon'

04:14.166 --> 04:15.500
shooter was from inside
the theater.

04:15.583 --> 04:17.667
Now, we need to go back
and look at actors, crew

04:17.750 --> 04:19.417
whoever else was inside.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.333
I hate musicals.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.375
Well, you wouldn't,
if you'd seen me as Danny Zuko

04:32.458 --> 04:35.542
in my eighth grade
production
of "Grease".

04:35.625 --> 04:37.709
Brought the house down.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.709
Victim is Dennis Hofferman,
35. Cabdriver.

05:13.792 --> 05:15.375
One of the most dangerous jobs
there is

05:15.458 --> 05:17.083
and the guy gets
shot
doing a musical.

05:17.166 --> 05:19.375
Was killed opening night,
before the curtain even went
up.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.792
Robbery theory seemed
solid at the time.

05:21.875 --> 05:23.208
That part of Francisville

05:23.291 --> 05:25.041
had a string of holdups,
same MO.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.875
One shot to the chest,
close range, wallet gone.

05:27.959 --> 05:30.375
Somebody sure wanted it
to look like a robbery.

05:30.458 --> 05:33.041
Ballistics confirms the .38
is the murder weapon.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.083
There was a fiancee.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.500
Gloria Hill.
Let's talk to her first.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.250
See if Dennis was having
trouble
with anyone there.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.792
Then we gotta talk
to a bunch of actors.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.375
Try and guess
who's telling the truth.

05:47.834 --> 05:50.250
Dennis was the sweetest
guy I ever knew.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.291
Honest to the bone.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.709
And that's not so easy

05:52.792 --> 05:54.083
to find, you know?

05:54.166 --> 05:55.750
Yeah. I do.

05:55.834 --> 05:57.834
We were real happy.

05:57.917 --> 05:59.625
About to set
a wedding date,
too.

05:59.709 --> 06:01.125
You two meet here?

06:01.208 --> 06:02.583
My family owns
the place.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.083
Dennis was right out
of community college.

06:05.166 --> 06:08.250
Took it as a temporary
job
after his mom died.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.500
But he stuck around.

06:09.583 --> 06:10.750
Got
comfortable,
I guess.

06:10.834 --> 06:13.709
Oh, but he had so much talent.

06:13.792 --> 06:15.750
Was my leading man
right here in the
garage.

06:15.834 --> 06:20.458
What made him decide
to audition for "Cabaret"?

06:20.542 --> 06:22.625
Did he know someone
at that theater?

06:22.709 --> 06:23.583
No.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.917
He saw the sign driving by.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.792
Said it was like a
siren
went off in his
head.

06:28.875 --> 06:30.792
Week later, he auditioned.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.625
How'd he get along
with the group there?

06:32.709 --> 06:34.750
There was some
trouble,
right from the
beginning.

06:34.834 --> 06:35.917
What kind of trouble?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.792
Neither of us
had any idea

06:37.875 --> 06:39.625
what a cutthroat
world
the theater was.

06:39.709 --> 06:46.125
mein lieber herr

06:46.208 --> 06:47.250
No nerves.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.542
They're lucky to have you.

06:49.625 --> 06:51.750
Thanks.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.917
This show..

07:00.000 --> 07:02.875
...is about the danger..

07:02.959 --> 07:06.834
...of not facing the truth.

07:06.917 --> 07:10.834
The truth about others,
and, most important..

07:10.917 --> 07:13.542
...the truth about yourself.

07:13.625 --> 07:15.709
'So I have a question.'

07:17.166 --> 07:22.291
Can you shut off your memory
and live in the now?

07:24.083 --> 07:28.041
A community will form here,
if and only if..

07:29.291 --> 07:31.667
...you..

07:31.750 --> 07:34.959
...trust..

07:35.041 --> 07:36.333
...me.

07:36.417 --> 07:38.625
'Trust me.'

07:38.709 --> 07:41.250
And why should you trust me?

07:41.333 --> 07:43.542
Because I've acted with
Uta Hagen on stage

07:43.625 --> 07:45.208
and with Bobby De Niro
in movies?

07:45.291 --> 07:46.291
No.

07:47.709 --> 07:50.750
You should trust me..

07:50.834 --> 07:54.875
...because I'm the director.

07:54.959 --> 07:56.125
Rehearsal!

07:56.208 --> 07:57.542
Let me have my Sally

07:57.625 --> 08:00.208
over here,
my Cliff over here

08:00.291 --> 08:03.250
my Emcee over there.

08:07.291 --> 08:08.375
Shut off my memory.

08:08.458 --> 08:09.750
Live in the now. Wow.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.500
[laughs]
That's intense stuff.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.041
- So, you're playing Sally?
- Yep.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.875
Name's Nora.

08:14.959 --> 08:17.625
I-I saw you at the audition.
You were really good.

08:17.709 --> 08:21.041
God, I was so nervous.
I just-I wanted it so bad.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.375
I can't believe
I got a lead role.

08:23.458 --> 08:24.500
Oh, sorry.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.417
- Yeah, watch it.
- 'I was just--'

08:26.500 --> 08:28.083
So you think Cliff fits
the lead roll?

08:28.166 --> 08:30.583
It's...one of them.
Isn't it?

08:30.667 --> 08:33.000
No, the Emcee is
the star of this show.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.417
I'm in every damn scene.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.458
Only Cliff is just some
sucker
who walks around

08:36.542 --> 08:37.917
and watches everybody.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.709
I mean, you don't even have
your own song, man.

08:39.792 --> 08:41.250
Listen, I'm sorry
if I offended you.

08:41.333 --> 08:42.625
Of course the Emcee
is a lead role.

08:42.709 --> 08:44.250
I don't think
you're hearing me.

08:44.333 --> 08:47.417
You get in my way,
you step in my space

08:47.500 --> 08:49.417
and you ain't gonna
make it to opening night.

08:54.375 --> 08:59.542
<i>♪ Du kennst mich wohl mein</i>
<i>herr</i>
<i>Ach lebe wohl mein Herr ♪♪</i>

08:59.625 --> 09:02.250
Denny was so excited
about that first rehearsal

09:02.333 --> 09:04.291
'he didn't even sleep
the night before.'

09:04.375 --> 09:06.208
Then that Clinton
had
to ruin it for him.

09:06.291 --> 09:07.792
What did Dennis think
about Clinton?

09:07.875 --> 09:10.792
He didn't mention it again,
and I thought things got
better.

09:13.041 --> 09:15.166
Guess I was wrong.

09:26.208 --> 09:29.000
- What can I get you guys?
- We're not here for the
cosmos.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.333
Too bad. I make a mean one.

09:32.917 --> 09:35.041
We've got some questions
about Dennis Hofferman.

09:35.125 --> 09:37.125
I'm buried here.
Show's gonna start soon.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.500
And I got to serve people.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.083
(Vera)
'Hey, you wouldn't
want to lose your job.'

09:40.166 --> 09:44.166
Criminal record of yours
could make it hard to find
work.

09:49.542 --> 09:51.417
That's a cheap shot, man.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.291
That theft charge
is from way back.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.542
Theft, possession,
trafficking stolen goods.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.667
You were a real live
gangbanger,
weren't you, Clinton?

09:57.750 --> 09:59.375
I was messed up, yeah.

09:59.458 --> 10:02.125
But that was before I got
with
the theater, got off the
street.

10:02.208 --> 10:03.667
We heard you brought
trouble
right in with you.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.041
Got tough on other
actors,
threatened Dennis.

10:06.125 --> 10:09.291
I learned real early how to play
tough to cover up being scared.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.500
(Clinton)
'That's all it was.
But I got over it.'

10:11.583 --> 10:13.375
And me and Denny got tight.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.125
You can ask anybody in the cast.

10:15.208 --> 10:16.500
- We will.
- 'Look.'

10:16.583 --> 10:19.250
I had no reason
to hurt anybody there.

10:19.333 --> 10:21.125
That place turned
my life around.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.750
'Put me on a solid path.'

10:22.834 --> 10:24.625
I'm a family man now.

10:24.709 --> 10:27.583
Problem is, we know someone
from inside killed Dennis.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.625
And you're the only one
with a rap sheet.

10:29.709 --> 10:31.291
Let's just say that
I wasn't the only one

10:31.375 --> 10:32.834
with anger management issues.

10:32.917 --> 10:33.959
(Jeffries)
'You got something to say'

10:34.041 --> 10:36.208
I suggest you let it fly.

10:36.291 --> 10:40.792
Our big daddy director...
had a serious dark side.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.375
(Nora)
'Mama..'

10:47.458 --> 10:50.750
doesn't even have an inkling

10:50.834 --> 10:53.792
that I'm working
in a nightclub

10:53.875 --> 10:58.500
in a pair of lacy pants.

10:58.583 --> 11:01.458
So, please, sir..

11:18.917 --> 11:20.250
'Ooh!'

11:34.250 --> 11:35.542
(Clinton)
'Oh, my bad.'

11:35.625 --> 11:37.041
I forgot
where I'm supposed to be.

11:37.125 --> 11:38.583
I think my cross
messed you guys up.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.583
No, you guys were perfect.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.000
I'm the idiot.

11:42.083 --> 11:43.458
'Found a whole new
thing I'm awful at.'

11:43.542 --> 11:45.250
Dancing in heels.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.542
Line, please!

11:46.625 --> 11:48.709
If you had a secret,
you bet I would keep it.

11:51.291 --> 11:52.625
- 'I messed up.'
- You think it's cute?

11:52.709 --> 11:54.917
That you don't know
what you're doing?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.625
- Of course not, I--
- 'Nora.'

11:56.709 --> 11:58.166
I actually
believed in you.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.750
Sally Bowles is supposed to be
a second-rate singer

12:01.834 --> 12:04.625
'but you are hovering
below third-rate!'

12:04.709 --> 12:06.959
Try harder!

12:08.750 --> 12:11.000
And the Emcee
is supposed to be

12:11.083 --> 12:12.834
from the streets.

12:12.917 --> 12:14.625
I want you to give me
some of that dirt

12:14.709 --> 12:18.542
that edge, not this lazy
punk attitude.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.750
Try harder!

12:22.208 --> 12:24.417
Lyle is just the music director

12:24.500 --> 12:26.291
'and yet, he knows every word'

12:26.375 --> 12:28.166
'and you can't
remember your own?'

12:28.250 --> 12:30.000
Pathetic!

12:31.417 --> 12:33.750
I think they're both
really talented.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.625
I know you're a big shot
in the business.

12:40.709 --> 12:42.583
But that doesn't mean
you can treat people like
that.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.333
You think you know
better than I do..

12:45.417 --> 12:47.000
...cabbie?

12:47.083 --> 12:49.500
I'm just saying you don't
have to be mean, that's all.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.250
I will be and do
whatever it takes

12:52.333 --> 12:53.834
to get this show
to the next level.

12:53.917 --> 12:55.083
'Do you understand?'

12:55.166 --> 12:56.166
I guess not.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.417
(Rafe)
'Then let me explain.'

12:57.500 --> 13:00.375
My reputation
is on the line here

13:00.458 --> 13:02.625
and I will crush anyone

13:02.709 --> 13:05.542
'before I let them
embarrass me or ruin'

13:05.625 --> 13:08.875
what I have worked 30 years..

13:08.959 --> 13:11.083
..to build!

13:12.458 --> 13:13.959
Take five!

13:16.875 --> 13:18.375
- Good looking out.
- Yeah.

13:18.458 --> 13:21.000
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.291
Dennis stood up for us.

13:27.375 --> 13:29.375
'I don't think Rafe
ever forgave him for that.'

13:29.458 --> 13:32.083
You saying that's motive
for murder?

13:32.166 --> 13:36.041
The thing is,
Rafe came asking me about guns

13:36.125 --> 13:37.500
a few weeks
before Dennis was killed.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.583
What?

13:38.667 --> 13:40.166
I know I should've
said something

13:40.250 --> 13:41.709
but I'm the one with the record.

13:41.792 --> 13:43.208
And I knew I'd be the one
to get in trouble.

13:43.291 --> 13:44.583
For talking to him about guns?

13:44.667 --> 13:46.583
He wanted me to get him one.

13:46.667 --> 13:49.208
You know, since I knew my way
around the streets.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.166
So, I did.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.625
A .38.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.166
(Rush)
'Rafe Webb?'

14:10.250 --> 14:11.750
That's right.

14:11.834 --> 14:13.417
Detectives Rush, Miller.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.792
Lady cops, terrific.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.583
Here to ask you
about Dennis Hofferman.

14:19.667 --> 14:22.083
What a tragedy that was.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.083
Two years ago, I did "Ibsen".

14:25.166 --> 14:27.208
Played the father
of a dead child

14:27.291 --> 14:30.834
and I tapped into
my feelings for Dennis.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.709
Got the best reviews
of my life.

14:33.792 --> 14:35.083
Congratulations.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.125
(Rush)
'Rafe, we hear
you got yourself a gun'

14:37.208 --> 14:38.792
a few weeks before Dennis died.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.208
Well, how is that relevant?

14:40.291 --> 14:41.959
Dennis was shot in a stick-up.

14:42.041 --> 14:44.125
New information says otherwise.

14:44.208 --> 14:47.458
Well, I, uh...I'm
afraid
I did get a gun.

14:47.542 --> 14:48.792
And why'd you do that?

14:48.875 --> 14:51.250
I heard the cop
movie "Blue Blood"

14:51.333 --> 14:52.625
was shooting
in Philly.

14:52.709 --> 14:54.667
'I was going
to audition.'

14:54.750 --> 14:56.291
I'm method.

14:56.375 --> 14:59.625
I needed to tap into
the emotions of holding a gun

14:59.709 --> 15:01.041
'if I was going
to play a cop.'

15:01.125 --> 15:02.959
So you bought a real one?

15:03.041 --> 15:04.959
Yeah, I went
to target practice, too.

15:05.041 --> 15:07.166
And then the studio decided

15:09.667 --> 15:10.959
Where's the gun now, Rafe?

15:11.041 --> 15:14.458
It was stolen out of my office.

15:14.542 --> 15:15.959
'Just a little time
before the show.'

15:16.041 --> 15:17.709
And you never mentioned
this before?

15:17.792 --> 15:20.709
You see,
I...I bought it illegally.

15:20.792 --> 15:23.125
So I couldn't exactly
report it stolen.

15:23.208 --> 15:24.667
That's kind of shaky, Rafe.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.709
Especially since people
saw you and Dennis fighting.

15:27.792 --> 15:29.375
Said you weren't too happy
with him.

15:29.458 --> 15:32.000
O-our relationship
was tumultuous,
yes.

15:32.083 --> 15:35.166
You see, my style
is to tear actors down

15:35.250 --> 15:37.166
and then build them back up.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.542
I don't shoot them.

15:38.625 --> 15:40.834
We could bring him in right
now
for buying the gun.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.125
Might help him tap into
the emotions of jail time.

15:43.208 --> 15:47.083
Look, I didn't kill
Dennis,
and I don't know who
did.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.583
But there-there was
a little...situation

15:52.667 --> 15:54.959
that Dennis
had gotten himself into.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.333
(Rafe)
'Very nice, you two.'

16:16.959 --> 16:17.917
What are you smiling about?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.083
Uh, I don't know.

16:20.166 --> 16:24.041
I've just been...kind of flying
on air since rehearsals started.

16:24.125 --> 16:25.583
Me, too.

16:25.667 --> 16:28.125
This place is kind of
magical,
isn't it?

16:30.291 --> 16:31.709
Alright.

16:31.792 --> 16:34.875
Now, do you all remember
when I said that trust

16:34.959 --> 16:37.458
is the key to performance?

16:37.542 --> 16:38.959
'Well, I want
to try something.'

16:39.041 --> 16:43.000
Put down your scripts,
come up here and form a
circle.

16:43.083 --> 16:44.959
Here's what I want.

16:45.041 --> 16:48.041
I want you to fall back
into the arms

16:48.125 --> 16:49.750
'of the person behind you.'

16:49.834 --> 16:54.083
Before you fall,
I want you to tell a secret

16:54.166 --> 16:55.583
'about yourself.'

16:55.667 --> 16:58.083
'Something that you have
never shared before.'

16:58.166 --> 17:01.625
It's all about creating
a safe environment, people.

17:01.709 --> 17:04.166
Start with you, Robin.

17:10.458 --> 17:13.083
I felt relief
when my father
died.

17:19.166 --> 17:21.166
Clinton, to me.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.792
I don't trust any of you.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.375
I respect that.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.250
- 'Dennis?'
- Uh-hmm.

17:44.709 --> 17:46.542
I started driving a cab
because I didn't want

17:46.625 --> 17:48.917
to be lonely all the time.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.166
That's deep.
That's deep.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.834
(Rafe)
'Nora, to Dennis.'

18:00.709 --> 18:04.333
I think I'm falling in
love
with my leading man.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.166
Me?

18:08.250 --> 18:09.458
Ooh!

18:27.917 --> 18:28.917
(Miller)
'Plenty of blowups'

18:29.000 --> 18:30.333
at this place, huh?

18:30.417 --> 18:31.667
Welcome to the theater.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.250
So what was Lyle's problem?

18:33.333 --> 18:35.500
He had a thing for Nora,
I'm afraid.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.750
How did Dennis
take Nora's confession?

18:37.834 --> 18:40.750
He made it perfectly clear
to Nora that he had a
fiancee.

18:40.834 --> 18:43.000
But, uh, she didn't like that.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.166
Did either of them
have access to your office

18:45.250 --> 18:47.041
where you kept the gun?

18:47.125 --> 18:49.750
Everyone did.
I never locked it.

19:00.834 --> 19:02.500
Nora and Lyle are
on their way in now.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.375
So we're looking at
the love triangle?

19:04.458 --> 19:06.375
Yep. Nora angry
at the rejection.

19:06.458 --> 19:09.083
Lyle, the jealous outsider.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.291
We believe this director?

19:13.083 --> 19:14.583
Plenty of big dramas
with these people.

19:14.667 --> 19:17.667
Hard to sort through
what's real and what's made
up.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.709
That Clinton kid
seemed on the level.

19:19.792 --> 19:20.792
You kidding?

19:20.875 --> 19:22.208
You actually
bought his
act?

19:22.291 --> 19:24.291
I'll put money down
on Clinton being
clean.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.750
- 'Five bucks.'
- Five bucks?

19:26.834 --> 19:28.125
What kind of stakes are those?

19:28.208 --> 19:30.083
20 bucks on the director
as doer.

19:30.166 --> 19:32.041
Biggest liar, biggest ego.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.917
I'm going
with Lyle the piano
man.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.750
Sneaky guy with a bad crush.

19:35.834 --> 19:37.083
(Vera)
I say Nora.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.417
Lady could handle a .38 easy

19:38.500 --> 19:40.375
and the female
species
ain't exactly

19:40.458 --> 19:43.500
on my good
side right
now.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.583
What's this?

19:44.667 --> 19:47.083
It's an IOU.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.750
I'm going Clinton.
The Emcee.

19:49.834 --> 19:53.083
A street kid who couldn't
break his bad habits.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.583
Hey, here's my gal now.

20:05.542 --> 20:08.500
Hi. Is one of you
Detective Valens?

20:09.834 --> 20:12.083
I perform on cruise ships
these days.

20:13.709 --> 20:15.709
You'd be surprised how high-end
the productions are.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.542
Oh, I've heard they're..

20:17.625 --> 20:18.750
...top-notch.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.458
Nora, how did you feel
about Dennis?

20:20.542 --> 20:21.542
(Nora)
'Honestly?'

20:21.625 --> 20:23.208
I was in love with him.

20:23.291 --> 20:25.000
Must have been hard
falling for a guy

20:25.083 --> 20:26.375
who was engaged
to someone else.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.750
And humiliating.

20:27.834 --> 20:30.208
Once everyone else
knew about your feelings.

20:30.291 --> 20:31.625
Is that why
you shot him?

20:31.709 --> 20:33.917
I would never hurt Dennis.

20:35.625 --> 20:40.041
He was this...beautiful,
open person

20:40.125 --> 20:42.959
who saw the best in everyone.

20:43.041 --> 20:46.709
After two months, it was like
we'd always known each other.

20:46.792 --> 20:49.458
But there was that...
little problem of his
fiancee.

20:49.542 --> 20:51.125
Dennis didn't want to hurt her.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.959
But, after the show's run,
he was going to leave her.

20:54.041 --> 20:55.000
For me.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.709
Really?

20:56.792 --> 21:00.625
'Cause that's the first
we've heard about it.

21:00.709 --> 21:03.834
We found ourselves
during "Cabaret".

21:03.917 --> 21:07.667
And...we found each other.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.250
We hear you got pretty upset

21:09.333 --> 21:11.959
when Nora announced
her feelings for Dennis.

21:13.333 --> 21:15.500
Me and every other
straight guy there.

21:15.583 --> 21:18.000
But you were the only one
who stormed out of the
theater.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.542
I didn't storm out
of the theater

21:19.625 --> 21:22.333
because of my
little crush on Nora.

21:22.417 --> 21:23.458
Why, then?

21:23.542 --> 21:26.333
These little dramas
within the drama

21:26.417 --> 21:27.917
always end up
hurting the show.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.542
These actors are
given a chance

21:29.625 --> 21:32.500
to perform onstage,
realize a dream.

21:32.583 --> 21:38.000
And...they risk it all
for these fleeting emotions.

21:38.083 --> 21:39.375
But sounds like
you were suffering

21:39.458 --> 21:41.000
some fleeting
emotions yourself.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.125
Nothing I'd let
interfere
with the performance.

21:43.208 --> 21:46.208
So you're pretty dedicated.

21:46.291 --> 21:49.000
Uh. The theater's my life.

21:49.083 --> 21:50.291
I love it.

21:50.375 --> 21:53.375
But I know exactly
what can happen

21:53.458 --> 21:56.000
when emotions
start to boil over.

22:46.542 --> 22:48.417
(Rafe)
'Good.'

22:48.500 --> 22:49.792
'Alright.'

22:49.875 --> 22:51.250
'Great sound check.'

22:54.000 --> 22:56.166
Now, before we take our break

22:56.250 --> 22:58.333
I have an important
announcement.

22:58.417 --> 23:01.375
Many of you have heard
of Barry Turk

23:01.458 --> 23:03.333
my agent in New York.

23:03.417 --> 23:04.917
Doesn't he represent
De Niro?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.291
(Rafe)
'That's right.'

23:06.375 --> 23:08.458
And drumroll, please.

23:09.333 --> 23:10.750
He's going to come and see

23:10.834 --> 23:14.458
'the show next week,
on opening night!'

23:14.542 --> 23:16.000
And he's told me that if

23:16.083 --> 23:20.208
he sees good talent,
he might sign someone up.

23:22.417 --> 23:24.625
(Dennis)
'It'll be you the
agent signs, Nora.'

23:24.709 --> 23:26.917
You've got
that
star quality.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.125
No, it'll be you.

23:29.208 --> 23:33.959
(Nora on speaker)
'You're the talented one,
you're just so real up
there.'

23:34.041 --> 23:35.542
(Dennis on speaker)
'Maybe it'll be both of us.'

23:39.542 --> 23:41.834
- Hello, hi, Gloria.
- Hey, Lyle.

23:41.917 --> 23:43.417
Made some brownies
for the gang.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.333
You've all been
working so hard.

23:45.417 --> 23:48.333
That's so nice of you, thanks.

23:48.417 --> 23:52.750
(Nora)
'Dennis, I can't imagine
life after the play.'

23:54.458 --> 23:56.709
'Without you.'

23:56.792 --> 23:59.125
'We're an amazing team,
you know that?'

24:00.417 --> 24:03.125
Yeah, I do.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.834
(Dennis)
'Being here with you
is the only time'

24:04.917 --> 24:07.166
'I'm really happy
these days.'

24:15.834 --> 24:17.125
I should've turned off
the speakers

24:17.208 --> 24:20.125
as soon as she walked
into that booth.

24:20.208 --> 24:23.875
But part of me hoped
it would explode.

24:23.959 --> 24:27.208
And I'd be the one
to end up with Nora.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.542
(Lilly)
'Uh, Gloria made
it sound like'

24:28.625 --> 24:30.083
'everything with Dennis
was solid.'

24:30.166 --> 24:31.250
No way.

24:31.333 --> 24:32.417
That woman was furious.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.792
I thought she'd kill
him
then and there.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.583
Did you see her again?

24:36.667 --> 24:41.208
Yeah. Uh, backstage,
opening night.

24:41.291 --> 24:45.417
She was upset and
looking for Dennis.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.166
What is your problem
with musicals?

25:14.792 --> 25:17.417
Where was your wedding
going to be, Gloria?

25:17.500 --> 25:18.917
We hadn't decided.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.542
Huh. Most of my girlfriends
pick a place

25:21.625 --> 25:23.125
soon as they know
they're getting hitched.

25:23.208 --> 25:26.083
Unless there's trouble,
like their fiancee's in
love

25:26.166 --> 25:27.792
with someone else.

25:27.875 --> 25:29.709
Gloria, we know
you were upset

25:29.792 --> 25:33.083
and that you went backstage
before the show.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.875
I never even found him.

25:34.959 --> 25:37.667
Saw that Nora first
and left.

25:37.750 --> 25:39.166
Ask any of my family.

25:39.250 --> 25:40.875
'They were all there
for the big show.'

25:40.959 --> 25:42.417
We can't help if you don't
tell us the truth

25:42.500 --> 25:44.458
about your relationship.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.458
I loved Dennis.

25:46.542 --> 25:49.083
But once those
rehearsals started

25:49.166 --> 25:51.333
I faded into
the background to him.

25:51.417 --> 25:53.583
Well, why didn't
you tell us, Gloria?

25:53.667 --> 25:55.667
I didn't tell anybody.

25:55.750 --> 25:57.709
We were engaged for five years

25:57.792 --> 26:00.166
while everyone here
called me a fool

26:00.250 --> 26:03.834
'and I kept waiting
for him to commit.'

26:03.917 --> 26:07.667
How could I admit to anyone
that
it never would have happened?

26:24.208 --> 26:25.583
All I could think about
the whole shift

26:25.667 --> 26:28.959
was the opening tonight.

26:29.041 --> 26:30.709
Almost ran a couple
of curbs.

26:34.083 --> 26:35.166
I have a meeting
with the director today

26:35.250 --> 26:36.375
so I should leave soon.

26:36.458 --> 26:38.583
Is your girlfriend
gonna be there?

26:38.667 --> 26:41.083
What?

26:41.166 --> 26:43.250
I heard you the other night
with that actress.

26:43.333 --> 26:44.667
I know something's
going on.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.792
Nothing happened between
me and Nora, I swear!

26:46.875 --> 26:49.041
But you want it to,
don't you?

26:53.125 --> 26:57.166
I love you,
Gloria, I really do.

26:57.250 --> 26:58.834
But I'm just a little
confused right now.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.500
Obviously.

27:00.583 --> 27:02.208
'I don't want to hurt you.'

27:02.291 --> 27:05.542
But I need some time to think
about all this stuff.

27:08.250 --> 27:11.333
Remember when I
first got this job?

27:11.417 --> 27:13.875
I was gonna save money
and travel, maybe.

27:13.959 --> 27:15.041
Go to Australia.

27:15.125 --> 27:17.417
- Of course, I remember.
- But I never did.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.875
I never did anything,
except drive a cab.

27:19.959 --> 27:22.000
We can travel,
if that's what you
want.

27:22.083 --> 27:23.750
No, no, I'm just saying..

27:26.792 --> 27:29.583
...I haven't made
much of myself.

27:29.667 --> 27:32.291
And this meeting
with the director

27:32.375 --> 27:33.709
I know it's supposed
to be a secret

27:33.792 --> 27:35.625
but I really think that
it could make my future

27:35.709 --> 27:37.875
a whole lot brighter.

27:37.959 --> 27:39.542
Brighter.

27:39.625 --> 27:40.917
I don't understand, Denny.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.750
I thought we had
a really good life together.

27:43.834 --> 27:46.375
Were things really
so dark before?

27:46.458 --> 27:49.125
I just..

27:49.208 --> 27:51.375
I know I've been
a disappointment.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.250
I just don't wanna
be that anymore.

27:55.333 --> 27:57.625
You were never
a disappointment to
me.

28:11.667 --> 28:14.583
I guess you never really
know anyone all the way.

28:14.667 --> 28:17.000
What was the secret
meeting
with the director

28:17.083 --> 28:18.083
day of the show?

28:18.166 --> 28:19.750
All Dennis said was that

28:19.834 --> 28:23.917
it was with Rafe's bigwig
agent and Nora.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.750
'So I got angry again.'

28:27.792 --> 28:30.792
That was the last time we spoke.

28:34.041 --> 28:36.291
So what was this meeting
with Dennis before the show?

28:36.375 --> 28:37.792
Since you left
that out before

28:37.875 --> 28:39.542
maybe you can
fill us in now.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.792
I didn't think
it was
important.

28:41.875 --> 28:43.166
'It was simply so Dennis'

28:43.250 --> 28:46.792
could meet my agent,
Barry Turk.

28:46.875 --> 28:50.291
Our problem is,
we called Barry Turk.

28:50.375 --> 28:51.792
Got his client list.

28:54.875 --> 28:56.625
You're not on it.

28:58.542 --> 29:01.750
I was once.

29:01.834 --> 29:05.125
But Barry hadn't
returned
my phone call in six
years.

29:05.208 --> 29:07.625
So you lied to Dennis and Nora.

29:07.709 --> 29:09.291
(Rafe)
'Not exactly.'

29:09.375 --> 29:12.166
I mean, I'd left another damn
message for his assistant.

29:13.792 --> 29:17.041
- I was really hoping he'd
show.
- But he didn't.

29:17.125 --> 29:20.709
I couldn't tell my actors
that
I'd slipped to the B
list.

29:20.792 --> 29:23.208
I needed to build
myself up in their
eyes.

29:23.291 --> 29:24.500
(Vera)
'For your own ego?'

29:24.583 --> 29:26.000
Absolutely not!

29:29.667 --> 29:32.375
Maybe you're right.

29:32.458 --> 29:34.709
Maybe it was for my own ego.

29:34.792 --> 29:39.667
Whatever it was, I'm afraid
it may have cost Dennis
dearly.

29:43.959 --> 29:46.500
Barry Turk got stuck
in New York.

29:46.583 --> 29:47.542
'Missed the train.'

29:47.625 --> 29:49.000
'But he'll jump
a later one.'

29:49.083 --> 29:50.500
So, he'll make
the show tonight.

29:50.583 --> 29:52.834
Be able to see me
and Dennis perform.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.083
- Of course.
- Are you sure?

29:57.125 --> 29:58.792
Look, what's important

29:58.875 --> 30:00.375
for you two
to keep in
mind

30:00.458 --> 30:03.709
is that tonight's
performance could
decide

30:03.792 --> 30:05.417
someone's future.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.083
Oh God, I'm nervous.

30:07.166 --> 30:08.250
(Rafe)
'You should be.'

30:08.333 --> 30:10.375
The truth is, I have
a lot of say

30:10.458 --> 30:12.458
over who Barry chooses
to represent.

30:12.542 --> 30:15.458
He must really respect
your opinion.

30:15.542 --> 30:16.709
He does.

30:16.792 --> 30:19.709
And he likes to keep
a short client list.

30:19.792 --> 30:22.750
Only one new client a year.

30:25.625 --> 30:26.875
One client?

30:26.959 --> 30:28.917
That's right.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.750
Well, it should definitely
be you, Nora.

30:31.834 --> 30:33.500
You're truly gifted.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.166
You're right, Dennis.

30:37.250 --> 30:39.583
Rafe, Dennis is 35.

30:39.667 --> 30:40.750
I'm just 25.

30:40.834 --> 30:42.083
'I'm the one with
a real chance'

30:42.166 --> 30:43.500
'to make it
in the business.'

30:43.583 --> 30:44.917
'I'm the real
talent here.'

30:45.000 --> 30:46.750
You know I would work
the hardest for it.

30:46.834 --> 30:48.917
I am committed to going
all the way

30:49.000 --> 30:50.792
no matter what it takes.

30:51.667 --> 30:53.959
What was I thinking?

30:54.041 --> 30:58.125
I-I almost ruined
my life because of you.

31:08.792 --> 31:10.834
I thought a little
healthy competition

31:10.917 --> 31:12.333
would be good for them.

31:12.417 --> 31:16.667
I didn't think Nora would
be
so consumed by it all.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.000
Consumed enough
you think she'd kill him?

31:19.083 --> 31:20.542
Make sure she got the agent?

31:20.625 --> 31:25.125
She made it quite clear,
she was going to be a star.

31:25.208 --> 31:27.125
[sighs]
No matter what it took.

31:33.917 --> 31:35.959
So Nora wanted
the spotlight.

31:36.041 --> 31:38.208
The question is, was she
desperate enough to kill for
it?

31:38.291 --> 31:40.375
We've been going through
the play mementos Rafe gave us.

31:40.458 --> 31:43.625
He told us Dennis rushed to
a copy place before the show

31:43.709 --> 31:45.208
and we found out why.

31:45.291 --> 31:46.250
Cabaret program.

31:46.333 --> 31:47.542
A manager there told us
they were

31:47.625 --> 31:49.792
about to run it off
and Dennis stopped them.

31:49.875 --> 31:52.709
- Wanted to change his notes.
- 'Notes?'

31:52.792 --> 31:54.291
Each actor has a place
where they can write

31:54.375 --> 31:55.875
personal stuff
to their family and friends.

31:55.959 --> 31:59.208
"Gloria, I'm sorry if
I lost my way in the dark.

32:00.542 --> 32:01.875
"You are the only star
that can

32:01.959 --> 32:04.291
make my future brighter.
Let's set a date."

32:04.375 --> 32:08.667
Since the show never went on,
Gloria never saw the program

32:08.750 --> 32:11.166
'or knew Dennis
had come around.'

32:11.250 --> 32:12.542
Clinton.

32:12.625 --> 32:15.959
Uh. I, uh..

32:16.041 --> 32:18.250
I got something I think
you people need to hear.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.166
Well, go ahead.

32:20.250 --> 32:22.500
I didn't say anything before
because I..

32:22.583 --> 32:25.291
I knew you'd believe
her over me.

32:25.375 --> 32:26.792
'But now I got proof.'

32:28.083 --> 32:30.375
(Nora on phone)
'Clint, this is Nora.'

32:30.458 --> 32:32.792
'I know the police
have been talking to you'

32:32.875 --> 32:35.166
'and if you tell them
what I did that night'

32:35.250 --> 32:38.250
'you will be very, very sorry.'

32:40.750 --> 32:44.500
See? Always bet on the dame.

32:56.542 --> 32:59.959
Your friend Clinton's
in the next room.

33:00.041 --> 33:01.208
He played us your message.

33:01.291 --> 33:03.291
Oh, God.

33:03.375 --> 33:04.709
(Scotty)
'Yeah.'

33:04.792 --> 33:07.208
You need to tell me
what happened, Nora.

33:07.291 --> 33:09.709
[sighs]
I'm such an idiot.

33:09.792 --> 33:10.917
Why am I such an idiot?

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Don't know, but you better
start explaining.

33:15.625 --> 33:17.917
I didn't want Clinton
to say anything

33:18.000 --> 33:21.500
because my career is really
about to take off.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.792
And getting convicted of
murder
might get in the way?

33:23.875 --> 33:26.208
I did not kill Dennis.
I'm innocent!

33:26.291 --> 33:28.333
Hey, this ain't
a performance, Nora.

33:28.417 --> 33:31.375
This is real life,
and you're in real trouble.

33:35.875 --> 33:38.250
Okay. Okay.

33:39.250 --> 33:42.041
I was young
and
insecure.

33:43.500 --> 33:47.500
And I let my
emotions
get the best of me.

34:15.208 --> 34:16.125
Oh, Cliff!

34:29.542 --> 34:32.542
You can't be mad
at me forever, Dennis.

34:32.625 --> 34:35.625
I'm just committed, totally.

34:35.709 --> 34:38.000
That's why I'll
bet
you'll be a
star.

34:38.083 --> 34:39.792
Hmm.

34:39.875 --> 34:41.250
And I'll be driving my cab.

34:42.750 --> 34:45.250
[sighs]
This was fun.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.750
But I don't think I like
shutting off my memory.

34:47.834 --> 34:49.834
Living in the now.

34:49.917 --> 34:51.625
You forget too much.

34:51.709 --> 34:54.208
Hey, they're looking
for you guys in costumes.

34:55.083 --> 34:56.250
I'm gonna get ready.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.500
Man, I'm kind of nervous.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.166
I don't blame you.

35:09.959 --> 35:13.333
Rafe told me Barry Turk
wants to walk outta here

35:13.417 --> 35:15.000
with some new clients.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.250
Cool.

35:16.333 --> 35:20.000
- I think you are so
talented.
- Thank you.

35:20.083 --> 35:23.000
But I'm afraid
Dennis
has a better shot.

35:23.083 --> 35:26.375
'He's just more..'

35:26.458 --> 35:29.792
...commercial, you know?

35:29.875 --> 35:32.709
Well, we'll see, I guess.

35:32.792 --> 35:34.667
But why take that chance?

35:36.792 --> 35:39.250
If we mess Dennis up,
the agent can focus on

35:39.333 --> 35:40.458
you and me instead.

35:40.542 --> 35:42.375
What do you mean,
mess him up?

35:42.458 --> 35:44.834
Look, I know about
your background okay?

35:44.917 --> 35:46.250
The jail
time,
the gangs.

35:46.333 --> 35:48.083
It's all cool with me.

35:48.166 --> 35:49.917
If you put
on a ski mask

35:50.000 --> 35:51.041
which they have
in the costume
room

35:51.125 --> 35:52.792
by the way
and wait
outside

35:52.875 --> 35:54.291
until Dennis goes for
his cigarette break--

35:54.375 --> 35:55.709
A ski mask?

35:55.792 --> 35:57.125
Just listen, okay?

35:57.208 --> 35:59.834
You could pretend
to be a robber, take his
wallet

35:59.917 --> 36:01.291
'scare the hell out of him.'

36:01.375 --> 36:03.458
You could use
the director's gun.

36:03.542 --> 36:05.250
I saw that he keeps it
in his office drawer.

36:05.333 --> 36:07.166
You want me to shoot Dennis?

36:07.250 --> 36:08.875
Of course not!

36:09.000 --> 36:10.125
I just want you
to rattle him up

36:10.208 --> 36:12.250
so he's a wreck onstage.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.875
Then you and I can shine.

36:15.375 --> 36:18.875
- Blow that Barry Turk away.
- You are out of your mind.

36:18.959 --> 36:22.041
Nobody gets hurt
and we'll go to the next
level.

36:22.125 --> 36:24.583
What's crazy about that?

36:24.667 --> 36:29.291
You know,
a couple of months ago

36:29.375 --> 36:32.750
I would have done it.
You know that?

36:32.834 --> 36:34.500
Because I would have believed
that that was all

36:34.583 --> 36:36.709
I was good for.

36:36.792 --> 36:38.083
But not anymore.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.250
And if I ever get an agent..

36:42.792 --> 36:45.709
...it's gonna be because
I put on one hell of show.

36:52.792 --> 36:54.834
After what Clinton said,
I realized

36:54.917 --> 36:56.125
I was acting like a lunatic.

36:56.208 --> 36:58.625
Your plan is exactly
how it went down.

36:58.709 --> 37:00.000
It's a heck of a coincidence.

37:00.083 --> 37:01.458
(Nora)
I know.

37:01.542 --> 37:04.458
Why do you think I didn't
want Clinton to talk?

37:04.542 --> 37:06.458
I knew how guilty
it made me look.

37:06.542 --> 37:09.417
'But I swear on my life..'

37:10.333 --> 37:12.583
...I did not hurt Dennis.

37:12.667 --> 37:13.625
One of them must
have done it.

37:13.709 --> 37:16.750
It's too detailed a plan.

37:16.834 --> 37:19.041
Unless someone
overheard it.

37:23.291 --> 37:25.041
I'm glad to help,
but I'm pretty sure

37:25.125 --> 37:27.291
I told you guys
everything I know already.

37:27.375 --> 37:30.083
I don't think so, Lyle.

37:30.166 --> 37:31.917
No?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.041
No.

37:34.125 --> 37:35.875
We know you were in that booth
for sound check.

37:35.959 --> 37:38.166
That you could hear
everything onstage.

37:38.250 --> 37:40.542
So you heard Nora's plan
the night of the show

37:40.625 --> 37:42.834
and you went through
with it, didn't you?

37:42.917 --> 37:45.166
Her plan? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

37:45.250 --> 37:46.667
'Oh, the actors
are given a chance'

37:46.750 --> 37:49.583
to get onstage,
realize a dream.

37:50.208 --> 37:51.125
Your words.

37:51.208 --> 37:52.667
Is that your dream, Lyle?

37:52.750 --> 37:54.542
- To be onstage?
- Oh, come on.

37:54.625 --> 37:55.834
I love playing music.

37:55.917 --> 37:57.959
But the music isn't
what people clap for

37:58.041 --> 37:59.875
at the end
of the show, is it?

37:59.959 --> 38:02.208
That's because they're morons.

38:02.291 --> 38:04.375
You know, I think
you're a lot like Dennis.

38:04.458 --> 38:08.333
Watching life pass you by,
dreaming of a spotlight.

38:08.417 --> 38:09.875
'But Dennis was brave.'

38:09.959 --> 38:12.667
He got up his nerve, went out
there and auditioned.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.917
- You were too scared.
- Is that why you killed him?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.125
'Or did you kill him
just because you knew'

38:16.208 --> 38:17.333
he was better than you?

38:17.417 --> 38:18.667
- Better than me?
- 'Mm-hmm.'

38:18.750 --> 38:20.125
I don't think so.

38:20.208 --> 38:21.792
Oh, pretty easy to sit
on the sidelines, judging.

38:21.875 --> 38:23.625
But you know what, I don't
think you could've hacked it

38:23.709 --> 38:24.917
under those bright lights.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.041
You're wrong!

38:27.125 --> 38:29.458
If I'd gotten onstage
that night with Barry Turk

38:29.542 --> 38:32.208
in the front row, everyone
would've been blown away!

38:32.291 --> 38:34.166
But you were never
gonna get onstage.

38:34.250 --> 38:35.583
Wrong again!

38:35.667 --> 38:37.208
With Dennis gone,
I was the only one

38:37.291 --> 38:38.375
who could go on in his place.

38:38.458 --> 38:41.041
I knew every word of that show!

38:41.125 --> 38:43.291
You killed him and thought
the curtain would still go
up?

38:43.375 --> 38:45.583
I was just gonna hit him in the
leg, send him to the hospital.

38:45.667 --> 38:48.792
It isn't fair they
canceled the show!

38:50.208 --> 38:52.667
Whatever happened
to "The show must go on?"

38:55.291 --> 38:57.417
'I knew every word.'

38:58.291 --> 38:59.542
Every word.

39:01.375 --> 39:03.959
You don't believe me?

39:13.709 --> 39:15.375
There was a Cabaret..

39:17.000 --> 39:21.250
...and there was
a master of ceremonies.

39:21.333 --> 39:24.375
And there was a city
called Berlin

39:24.458 --> 39:26.250
in a country called Germany.

39:28.125 --> 39:29.792
It was the end of the world.

39:32.458 --> 39:36.083
And I was dancing
with Sally Bowles.

39:38.208 --> 39:42.709
And we were both fast asleep.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.291
Give me all your money.

40:20.333 --> 40:24.000
Lyle, that's the worst
fake voice I ever heard!

40:24.083 --> 40:25.834
What are you up to?

40:27.583 --> 40:30.917
You think I'm a joke, huh?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
'You think you're
better than me?'

40:33.083 --> 40:34.959
Huh?

40:35.041 --> 40:36.291
Let's go inside, okay?

40:36.375 --> 40:38.333
- It's almost time.
my

40:38.417 --> 40:39.667
'Not yours.'

40:41.250 --> 40:42.583
You've had enough.

40:42.667 --> 40:45.500
Look, all I want to do
is put on a good show

40:45.583 --> 40:47.000
and go home to my fiancee.

40:47.083 --> 40:49.041
This is my home!

40:49.125 --> 40:51.166
It's all I have!

40:51.250 --> 40:52.542
'And this..'

40:53.625 --> 40:56.458
...is going to be my show.

40:56.542 --> 41:00.583
For once, I'm gonna be the one
that gets to shine!

41:02.041 --> 41:03.125
'Lyle.'
