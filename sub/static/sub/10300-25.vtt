01:14.660 --> 01:16.457
<i>Last week
on</i> Married... With Children <i>:</i>

01:16.660 --> 01:19.379
<i>The Bundys thought they won
a free trip to England.</i>

01:19.580 --> 01:22.856
Whoa, England!

01:23.060 --> 01:25.494
<i>And the D'Arcys
>decided to go along.</i>

01:25.700 --> 01:27.372
<i>But there's a catch for the Bundys...</i>

01:27.580 --> 01:31.129
<i>... an ancient English curse
that dates back to 1653.</i>

01:31.340 --> 01:34.218
And so that ye
and all your male descendants...

01:34.420 --> 01:37.696
...will be hated
in this place forever...

01:37.900 --> 01:42.530
...Lower Uncton
shall always be in darkness.

01:42.740 --> 01:44.696
<i>The only way the curse
can be lifted...</i>

01:44.900 --> 01:48.256
<i>... is if Al and Bud are killed within
the town limits of Lower Uncton.</i>

01:48.460 --> 01:50.530
<i>That is the job of these two men.</i>

01:50.900 --> 01:52.891
<i>But if Lower Uncton
gets the sun back...</i>

01:53.100 --> 01:56.297
<i>... the neighboring town of Upper
Uncton will lose their tourist trade.</i>

01:56.500 --> 02:00.129
<i>So these two men
have to kill the Bundys in London.</i>

02:00.340 --> 02:02.535
<i>And these two
want to kill the Bundys anywhere...</i>

02:02.740 --> 02:05.174
<i>... since they drove off
with their luggage and money.</i>

02:05.580 --> 02:09.128
<i>They have only one friend,
the dog they left behind.</i>

02:09.340 --> 02:14.130
<i>I don't care who kills them,
as long as they come back in a box.</i>

02:14.340 --> 02:16.774
<i>And now</i> Married... With Children
<i>continues.</i>

02:20.060 --> 02:22.051
Boy, is that good.

02:27.980 --> 02:29.618
Gentlefolk?

02:31.260 --> 02:34.138
Listen, when we said
"all expenses paid"...

02:34.340 --> 02:38.049
...we didn't really mean
a river suite at the Savoy.

02:38.300 --> 02:42.498
I'll have you know, sir, that we are
accustomed to the finer things in life.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.737
- Mom, what's this?
- It's a fork, honey.

02:45.940 --> 02:48.056
Oh, cool.

02:54.780 --> 02:59.774
I guess somebody should have
told that toilet the Yanks were coming.

03:02.180 --> 03:05.058
You know, family, Salem here...

03:05.260 --> 03:10.288
- Winston. The name is Winston.
- Like it matters.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.379
Anyhow, we are guests
in his lovely little country...

03:14.580 --> 03:16.172
...and since he is paying the tab...

03:16.380 --> 03:19.452
...let's go easy on the guy
and curb our expenses.

03:19.660 --> 03:22.174
Thank you very much,
young philistine.

03:27.740 --> 03:30.891
You know, honey, except for the fact
that you and the kids are here...

03:31.100 --> 03:33.455
...this is like a second honeymoon.

03:33.660 --> 03:36.697
Come look at the view with me,
sweetheart.

03:39.100 --> 03:42.615
There is something so infectious
about this country.

03:42.820 --> 03:46.654
I can just feel the class
rubbing off on us.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.133
Hey.

04:04.540 --> 04:06.531
It's a vegetable.

04:13.860 --> 04:18.809
Listen, you like rolls, do you? Or what
do you folks call them, "humma"?

04:19.019 --> 04:23.810
Is that it? Listen, Lower Uncton
is the home of humma.

04:24.060 --> 04:26.130
Who's with me? Yeah?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.129
Hey, now.

04:30.380 --> 04:33.975
All right, Bundys, you're dead.

04:36.220 --> 04:37.369
What?

04:41.540 --> 04:44.737
- Room service.
- Well, we didn't order anything.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.175
This is compliments of the house...

04:47.380 --> 04:50.258
...for spending £5000 in one day.

04:52.220 --> 04:56.099
This is a delicate French dessert
called A-bomb.

05:00.620 --> 05:05.455
You must eat it very slowly,
particularly the males.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.215
The Savoy. At last,
we found the Bundys.

05:16.420 --> 05:19.332
Now we can get our luggage
and our money and enjoy the trip.

05:19.540 --> 05:20.734
Yeah, come on!

05:23.020 --> 05:25.614
Here you go, my good man.

05:47.620 --> 05:50.054
So once again,
I'd just like to thank you...

05:50.260 --> 05:54.014
...for being so very, very careful
amongst all these valuable antiques.

05:54.260 --> 05:56.535
Hey, look here, kids,
my hand is stuck in a vase.

05:56.780 --> 06:00.932
Oh, my hand's stuck in the vase.
Help me, help me... Just kidding.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.574
Hey, hey. Look, here's a place
we haven't been yet:

06:07.780 --> 06:10.852
"The London Dungeons."
I wanna see something scary.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.290
Well, then take a look at this.

06:15.380 --> 06:16.699
Hey, Menthol...

06:18.740 --> 06:21.459
...where in this burg
can a man get a copy of <i>Big 'Uns?</i>

06:22.420 --> 06:24.251
<i>Big 'Uns?</i>

06:26.220 --> 06:31.613
Yes, well, in this country we call them
booby rags.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.253
There you go.

06:37.020 --> 06:38.897
Well, let's go see some sights.

06:39.100 --> 06:42.570
But first, since we have to get
some gifts for the people back home...

06:42.780 --> 06:45.772
...everybody loot
something valuable.

06:47.180 --> 06:50.377
Let's go, come on. Oh, I like this.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.690
Killed a fish, let's go.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.819
We're just Americans.
Why'd they run?

08:05.020 --> 08:08.649
They must have been French.
Takes so little.

08:23.140 --> 08:26.450
Hey, it's Jack the Ripper.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.217
I think it's moving.

08:29.420 --> 08:33.049
Of course he's moving, Kel,
he sees a harlot.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.219
Daddy, I think the statue's moving.

08:37.940 --> 08:42.092
No, it's not. Now, don't be scared.
Here, watch this.

08:46.540 --> 08:50.294
See that? If it were alive,
I would have just broken its neck.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.570
No man could have taken that
without screaming.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.657
Come on, pumpkin, let's go.

09:00.020 --> 09:03.251
I'm bored. Let's go spend
some more of Winston's money.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.098
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:50.380 --> 11:53.611
Excuse me, sir,
that will be £5000, please.

11:53.820 --> 11:56.050
- For the...
- I didn't forget to pay, did I?

11:56.260 --> 11:58.296
- Easily done, sir. Easily done.
- Sorry. Right.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.855
Where's that £5000 then?
Got it here somewhere.

12:01.060 --> 12:03.654
- Here's the money from the village.
- Brilliant. Well done.

12:03.860 --> 12:06.420
- Where did you get the money?
- We sold your farm.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.372
You what?!

12:09.460 --> 12:12.418
We're ready to go
to Lower Uncton now.

12:18.940 --> 12:23.456
Well, mole-boy, "arevadouche."
Here's where I leave you.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.333
What are you talking about?
We're going to Lower Uncton now.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.134
Not me. I didn't come all this way
to spend my vacation...

12:29.340 --> 12:33.856
...in a one-whore town. I'm a city girl,
and I'm staying right here in...

12:34.060 --> 12:36.494
Wait, where are we?

12:36.700 --> 12:38.577
- London.
- Exactly.

12:38.780 --> 12:41.294
And you don't think Mom and Dad
will notice you're gone?

12:41.500 --> 12:44.458
Nope, it's all been taken care of.

12:50.620 --> 12:53.214
Well, pumpkin, what do you
think of London now, huh?

12:53.420 --> 12:55.536
Good, good.

13:18.780 --> 13:22.534
Here we are.
This is where you'll be staying.

13:27.620 --> 13:30.009
Our own castle.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.253
Isn't it awfully dark for noon?

13:33.740 --> 13:36.208
No, not for England.

13:36.420 --> 13:41.414
Oh, Al, our own castle.
It's just like out of a storybook.

13:41.620 --> 13:44.054
- Isn't it romantic?
- Yeah, sure, babe.

13:44.620 --> 13:48.932
Listen, Smokey,
I want separate rooms...

13:49.140 --> 13:52.610
...and I'd like a guard
outside of mine, please.

13:52.820 --> 13:57.416
Don't worry, sir, we know
exactly where to put you.

14:00.140 --> 14:04.611
- You hear that, kids?
- We hear you, Dad. Right, Kel?

14:05.740 --> 14:07.298
I sure hope this place is heated...

14:07.500 --> 14:11.334
...because it'd be a damn shame to
come all this way to catch our deaths.

14:11.980 --> 14:13.652
You get it?

14:16.340 --> 14:18.729
Follow me, please,
and I'll show you to your quarters.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.168
Let's go, kids.

14:20.380 --> 14:24.259
- Al, have you seen Kelly?
- Bud's carrying her.

14:27.380 --> 14:30.292
Bad news.
We can't hang them until tomorrow.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.809
- Why not?
- The scaffolding's not here.

14:33.020 --> 14:36.376
We had to sell some of the wood
to buy nooses.

14:36.620 --> 14:41.455
Oh, yes. And what do you plan
to hang the nooses from?

14:41.660 --> 14:43.412
Well, we've thought of that.

14:43.620 --> 14:46.930
We're gonna have two
of our taller fellas hold them.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.970
I don't wanna hear any more. Right,
we're just gonna have to stab them.

14:53.220 --> 14:56.178
But the village children
were so looking forward to a hanging.

14:56.420 --> 15:00.891
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, the children.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.169
I think I'll buy one.

15:04.380 --> 15:06.177
What is this thing, Dad?

15:06.420 --> 15:09.537
Well, son, this being England and all,
I believe it's...

15:09.740 --> 15:12.493
And correct me if I'm wrong, Igor.

15:13.420 --> 15:15.809
- Stonehenge.

15:17.540 --> 15:20.134
Blimey, you nearly had it there, sir.

15:20.340 --> 15:24.253
Actually, this is the speaker's podium
for the festival tomorrow...

15:24.460 --> 15:29.818
...at which you and your son
will be our honored guests.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.612
You see that, son...

15:31.820 --> 15:35.495
...even the English know
that men are better.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.658
Yes, right this way, please.

15:41.820 --> 15:46.371
You know, I feel right at home here.
I think I could stay here forever.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.536
Me too, Dad.

16:10.660 --> 16:16.849
You know, Al, since we're in a castle,
crown me, baby.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.291
What the hell, it's the first thing
I had to pay for the whole trip.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.968
All right, Peg, go ahead and say it.

16:23.180 --> 16:27.093
- What am I, baby?
- You're the king, baby.

16:27.300 --> 16:31.498
- Make me believe it.
- Well, who's gonna make me believe it?

16:31.700 --> 16:33.577
Oh, all right.

16:33.780 --> 16:37.136
You're the king, baby.

16:37.340 --> 16:39.217
Good enough.

16:43.300 --> 16:47.009
Excuse me. Some of the area children
would like to have...

16:47.220 --> 16:50.098
...their pictures taken with you.
- With me?

16:50.300 --> 16:54.213
But I'm just a regular joe
that played high school football...

16:54.420 --> 16:56.490
...scored four touchdowns
in one game.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.737
Last city championship
Polk High ever won.

16:59.940 --> 17:03.216
I understand.
Bring those starstruck young'uns in.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.012
Come on, kid.

17:11.740 --> 17:15.449
There we go.
See how they love me, Peg?

17:15.660 --> 17:17.890
Say your prayers.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.736
All right, out we go. Come on.

17:21.980 --> 17:23.810
There we go.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.298
You see, Peg,
you gotta give something back.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.808
Can you feel the history
in the room, Peg?

17:34.020 --> 17:35.248
Oh, I know.

17:35.460 --> 17:39.419
You know, Igor was telling me
that they say Bud's room is haunted.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.975
I didn't tell him, though.
You know how jumpy he is.

17:42.180 --> 17:44.933
Well, good, because what he
doesn't know won't hurt him.

17:52.060 --> 17:57.737
Good evening, Bud.
We are the ghosts of your ancestors.

17:57.940 --> 18:02.968
- Beware.
- You will die in the morning.

18:03.220 --> 18:04.653
Run.

18:07.580 --> 18:12.495
- Run while you still can!
- Wanna buy some shoes?

18:16.620 --> 18:18.736
Just a moment, gentlemen.

18:21.460 --> 18:24.338
Hey, how come only you
get to eat the candy bar?

18:24.540 --> 18:25.768
I was the one who found it.

18:25.980 --> 18:29.052
Yeah, well, I'm the one who pointed out
the baby who was holding it.

18:29.260 --> 18:32.775
Well, maybe next time you'll have
the guts to do something about it.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.455
Well, at least we'll be warm tonight.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.093
Warm and entertained...

18:42.300 --> 18:45.451
...thanks to these free theatre tickets
those nice people gave us...

18:45.660 --> 18:48.732
...instead of food or money
or lodgings.

18:48.940 --> 18:50.851
Hey, I've never heard
of this show before.

18:51.060 --> 18:53.938
They say it's the longest-running show
in London's history.

18:54.140 --> 18:57.450
Tickets, please. Thank you.

19:05.380 --> 19:08.019
Bad Americans.

19:09.300 --> 19:12.178
Must be Shakespeare.
<i>Taming of the Shrew,</i> I believe.

19:13.020 --> 19:15.454
Would you like a drink
or a spanking?

19:34.100 --> 19:36.819
They say there's a girl in there
with the prince.

19:39.340 --> 19:40.898
Miss?

19:43.940 --> 19:46.613
- Hey!
- You're not allowed to wear it out there.

19:46.820 --> 19:49.015
Only with me.

19:49.900 --> 19:53.017
Miss, there's a gentleman
wishes to speak with you.

19:53.420 --> 19:55.888
Well, I'm kind of busy
with the prince.

19:56.140 --> 19:59.132
Well, he says it's about your family.

20:01.180 --> 20:03.489
I never should have had parents.

20:20.940 --> 20:23.693
Miss Bundy,
I felt I should warn you...

20:23.900 --> 20:27.131
...about a dastardly plot
against your family.

20:29.980 --> 20:34.053
- "Dastardly," "dastardly."
- It means "bad."

20:34.260 --> 20:36.376
"Real bad thing."

20:36.580 --> 20:38.969
"Family go bye-bye"?

20:41.860 --> 20:44.658
You must get them out
of Lower Uncton before sunrise...

20:44.860 --> 20:48.136
...or a terrible fate will befall them.

20:48.340 --> 20:52.652
- "Befall them."
- They will die.

20:54.420 --> 20:58.459
Then I must run like the stocking.
How can I thank you, kind stranger?

20:58.660 --> 21:01.811
By bringing your family
to Upper Uncton.

21:02.020 --> 21:04.614
You don't have to tell me twice.

21:06.380 --> 21:07.654
Where?

21:08.420 --> 21:11.059
Upper Uncton.

22:07.460 --> 22:12.215
<i>Will Kelly ever find her family?
Will the male Bundys survive?</i>

22:12.420 --> 22:15.457
<i>Was</i> Brooklyn Bridge
<i>really worthy of an Emmy?</i>

22:16.860 --> 22:21.456
<i>We'll answer two of these questions
next week on</i> Married... With Children.
