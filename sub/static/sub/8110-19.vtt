10:47.347 --> 10:48.415
SO SHE WON'T LOSE
ANY FINGERS.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.883
RULES OUT
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.284
WHERE'S HOUSE?
HE SAID TO MEET HIM HERE.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.020
HIS CHICKEN'S GONE.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.788
(Chase)
PROBABLY ON THE BALCONY.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.256
YOU KNEW HE HAD
A CHICKEN?

10:56.289 --> 10:59.026
HOW COME--?
(House)
DOWN HERE!

11:01.461 --> 11:05.799
LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
PLUS SHE'S SLOWLY TURNING BLUE.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.101
CAN WE RULE OUT
MAGICAL GUM?

11:08.135 --> 11:09.937
(Chase)
LOW CARDIAC OUTPUT
CAN CAUSE BOTH.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.204
PATIENT POSSIBLY HAS

11:11.238 --> 11:13.006
CARDIOMYOPATHY.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.307
POSSIBLY CAUSED
BY MERCURY POISONING

11:14.341 --> 11:15.909
FROM ALL THE TUNA FISH
SHE EATS AT SEA.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.244
(Masters)
UH, WHY ARE YOU PUTTING,

11:17.277 --> 11:19.146
UM, CHICKEN FOOTPRINTS
ON THE FLOOR?

11:19.179 --> 11:24.251
THAT CLEVER BASTARD WILSON
GOT A HOLD OF AN AUSTRALORP.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.220
AH.
HELLO.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.757
THE QUIETEST AND CALMEST
OF ALL THE CHICKENS.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.424
DAMN HIM.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.226
MERCURY POISONING
IS OUT.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.162
RED BLOOD CELLS
HAVE NORMAL MORPHOLOGY.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.363
(Thirteen)
RAYNAUD'S.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.932
VASOSPASM IN THE ULNAR ARTERY
WOULD EXPLAIN THE HAND.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.500
(Foreman)
BUT NOT THE LOSS
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.369
CEREBRAL VASOSPASM
EXPLAINS BOTH.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.871
(House)
CEREBRAL VASOSPASM

11:43.904 --> 11:44.872
MAKES SENSE.

11:44.905 --> 11:45.939
TAKE THIRTEEN.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.008
GIVE THE PATIENT A CALCIUM
CHANNEL BLOCKER INFUSION

11:48.041 --> 11:49.176
IN THE BASILAR ARTERY.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.445
MASTERS.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.281
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO TURN THAT IN.

11:55.916 --> 11:56.984
UM, I, UM,

11:57.017 --> 11:58.151
BEEN BUSY WITH MY PATIENT.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.187
YOU'RE NOT BUSY NOW.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.965
BAWWWWWWK BAWK.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.512
(Donovan)
MASTERS.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.547
STILL HAVEN'T TURNED IN
YOUR LOG?

12:27.580 --> 12:31.184
STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN
MY TENTH LP.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.053
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE

12:33.086 --> 12:34.988
HOUSE'S INTERNSHIP.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.857
FIRST YOU ACT
LIKE IT'S THE EQUIVALENT

12:36.890 --> 12:38.325
OF VOLUNTEERING
TO BE WATERBOARDED

12:38.358 --> 12:40.493
AND NOW
YOU'RE SUPPORTING IT?

12:42.195 --> 12:45.198
YOU'RE WEIRD.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.433
YOU MAKE PAPER AIRPLANES
FOR FUN

12:46.466 --> 12:48.168
AND HANG THEM
FROM THE CEILING.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.470
YOU HAVE A MEMBERSHIP
TO THE EINSTEIN MUSEUM

12:50.503 --> 12:53.006
AND AN OVERBEARING OBSESSION
WITH FACIAL SYMMETRY.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.875
IT INDICATES FREEDOM
FROM DISEASE.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.443
WE'RE BIOLOGICALLY
PROGRAMMED--

12:56.476 --> 12:57.444
THE POINT IS

12:57.477 --> 12:59.246
YOU RUB PEOPLE
THE WRONG WAY.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.982
BUT HOUSE IS OKAY WITH YOUR LACK
OF BEDSIDE MANNER.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.316
HE'S OKAY
WITH YOUR WILLINGNESS

13:03.350 --> 13:05.152
TO ARGUE ANY POINT
WITH ANYONE

13:05.185 --> 13:06.887
EVEN IF THEY OUTRANK YOU.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.189
HE'S OKAY WITH YOUR PECULIAR
FASHION SENSE.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.390
IT'S PECULIAR?

13:10.423 --> 13:11.959
HOUSE DOESN'T THINK
YOU'RE WEIRD,

13:11.992 --> 13:12.960
WHICH IS WEIRD,

13:12.993 --> 13:15.528
BUT GOOD WEIRD.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.197
IS THAT A CHICKEN?

13:23.937 --> 13:26.874
I THINK IT'S AN AUSTRALORP.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.143
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON MY PATIENT.

13:40.988 --> 13:41.989
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE
EXPLAIN TO ME

13:42.022 --> 13:42.990
WHAT HOUSE AND WILSON

13:43.023 --> 13:44.291
ARE DOING
WITH THOSE CHICKENS?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.159
THEY HAVE A BET TO SEE
WHO CAN KEEP A CHICKEN

13:46.193 --> 13:48.261
IN THE HOSPITAL THE LONGEST
WITHOUT GETTING BUSTED

13:48.295 --> 13:50.097
BY SECURITY.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.364
ADVANCING PAST
THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.466
AND WHY
ARE THEY DOING THIS?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.903
THE PLACE THEY BOUGHT THEM
ONLY HAD ONE PIG.

13:55.936 --> 13:59.873
I'M GLAD YOU'RE GONNA BE
STICKING AROUND AFTER TODAY.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.274
REALLY?
YOU WANT ME TO STAY?

14:01.308 --> 14:02.910
IT'S GOOD
TO ADD A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

14:02.943 --> 14:04.211
TO THE DEPARTMENT.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.046
SOMEONE WHO STILL REMEMBERS
THERE ARE RULES

14:06.079 --> 14:08.081
OTHER THAN HOUSE'S.

14:08.115 --> 14:11.384
IF I DON'T PLAY
BY HOUSE'S RULES,

14:11.418 --> 14:13.053
HE WON'T LET ME IN.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.488
FIND A WAY AROUND THEM.

14:15.522 --> 14:19.092
I'D HAVE TO LIE TO HIM,
WHICH IS STILL LYING.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.328
LYING ABOUT A LIE,

14:21.361 --> 14:22.629
THAT'S PRACTICALLY TELLING
THE TRUTH.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.964
CATHETER'S IN.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.565
START THE CALCIUM CHANNEL
BLOCKER DRIP.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.335
MEANS I NEED ANOTHER LP.
LUCKILY, I KNOW

14:28.368 --> 14:29.402
WHERE YOU CAN GET ONE.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.372
YOU GOOD HERE?
LET'S GO.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.477
MM.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.113
DECENT STICK.
VERY SMOOTH.

14:40.147 --> 14:44.317
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE HAD
A FEW OF THESE.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.319
SUPPOSE THAT COMES
WITH THE TERRITORY.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.654
I HAVE HUNTINGTON'S.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.190
NO NEED TO GET HUSHED
AND SOLEMN ABOUT IT.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.294
WHY ARE YOU LYING
ABOUT REHAB?

14:54.327 --> 14:56.463
BECAUSE THE REAL REASON
I WAS GONE

14:56.496 --> 14:58.631
IS NOT SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHARE.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.433
COULDN'T YOU JUST SAY THAT?

15:00.467 --> 15:03.436
SHOULD BE ENOUGH
FOR FOREMAN AND THE OTHERS.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.571
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU WORKED HERE?

15:04.604 --> 15:06.639
HOUSE'S PEOPLE
HAVE PERSONALITIES

15:06.673 --> 15:09.709
THAT RANGE FROM NOSY
TO "PARDON ME WHILE I DO

15:09.742 --> 15:11.711
THIS CAVITY SEARCH."

15:11.744 --> 15:13.280
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ROOM
FOR SOMEONE

15:13.313 --> 15:15.448
WHO DOES THINGS DIFFERENTLY?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.587
NO.

15:20.620 --> 15:24.992
NOT UNLESS HOUSE DECIDES
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.561
(Foreman)
DURING CATHETER REMOVAL,

15:28.595 --> 15:31.698
I GOT A GOOD LOOK
AT HER CEREBRAL MIDLINE.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.133
PINEAL GLAND
IS CALCIFIED.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.634
(Thirteen)
CASE CLOSED.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.169
I'LL START HER
ON HORMONE THERAPY.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.204
SHIP HER OUT.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.973
I HANDED IN MY LOG.

15:40.007 --> 15:43.143
ON YOUR WAY TO DO THAT,

15:43.176 --> 15:46.413
DID YOU HAPPEN TO STOP
AND GIVE THIRTEEN AN LP?

15:46.446 --> 15:49.749
THIRTEEN'S STIFF GATE,
SMALL PUPILS,

15:49.782 --> 15:52.519
AND THE RAGING HEADACHE
SHE'S HIDING GAVE YOU AWAY.

15:52.552 --> 15:56.656
YES.
AND I STILL BROKE A RULE.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.325
MY RULE.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.994
TOLD YOU TO DEFY THE MAN.
NOT THIS MAN.

16:01.028 --> 16:04.097
WHY IS IT SO WRONG
THAT I DON'T LIKE TO CHEAT?

16:05.398 --> 16:06.366
CAN WE GO?

16:06.399 --> 16:07.334
NO.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.069
NOT LIKING IT IS FINE.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.304
NOT DOING WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE
MAKES YOU AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.772
WASTES YOUR POTENTIAL.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.607
YOU WANT ME TO BE LIKE YOU.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.276
THAT'S THE LAST THING
I WANT.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.578
'CAUSE THEN NEITHER ONE OF US
WOULD BE EXCEPTIONAL.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.283
YOU THINK I'M EXCEPTIONAL?
NOT ANYMORE.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.454
I CAN DO MY JOB
WITHOUT COMPROMISING.

16:28.621 --> 16:29.756
NO, YOU CAN'T.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.458
'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.393
INTERNSHIP'S GONE.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.364
IT'S TIME FOR MASTERS
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.799
ENJOY BEING A SURGEON.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.668
YOU'LL BE FINE.

I'M GONNA BE A SURGEON.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.834
WELCOME
TO YOUR SURGICAL INTERNSHIP

17:47.867 --> 17:49.202
AT P.P.T.H.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.738
THE SENIOR RESIDENTS
STAND BEHIND YOU.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.873
WE'LL ALL GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER SOON ENOUGH.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.775
GRAB A DONUT
AND GET TO WORK.

WE'RE OUT OF DONUTS.

THAN THAT.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.092
CAN'T SEE A THING.

18:14.827 --> 18:18.198
PUSH CALCIUM CHLORIDE.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.600
IT WILL SUPERCHARGE

18:20.633 --> 18:21.768
THE PLATELETS

18:21.801 --> 18:24.671
AND INCREASE THE CLOTTING.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.476
TWO AMPS CALCIUM CHLORIDE.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.877
TELL THE BLOOD BANK

18:52.565 --> 18:54.467
UNLESS THEY
ASK A QUESTION.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.536
THAT'S BECAUSE,
GENERALLY SPEAKING,

18:56.569 --> 18:58.405
PLEDGES DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.177
UM, K.P.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.679
IS THAT PATIENT
KENDALL PEARSON?

19:06.713 --> 19:07.880
I THOUGHT
SHE WAS DISCHARGED.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.616
MM.
IT'S A HOUSE CASE.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.951
I NEVER KNOW
WHAT THAT GUY'S UP TO.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.820
I WANT YOU TO SCRUB IN
ON MY LUNG HARVEST.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.356
BUT IT'S MY FIRST DAY.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.191
YES, I KNOW.
I WAS THERE.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.892
BE SCRUBBED AND READY
IN 15 MINUTES.

19:47.019 --> 19:47.987
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.357
LAST I HEARD,
YOU WERE GOING HOME.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.559
KENDALL COLLAPSED

19:52.592 --> 19:53.860
THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING

19:53.893 --> 19:56.996
CALLED A "SYMPATHECTOMY."

19:57.029 --> 19:59.532
SHE MUST'VE HAD
A HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS

19:59.566 --> 20:00.900
CAUSED BY A NEURAL
OVERSTIMULATION

20:00.933 --> 20:02.435
IN HER KIDNEYS.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.970
SO THEY'RE CUTTING
THE NERVES.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.572
IT'S LIKE CUTTING
THE GAS LINE

20:05.605 --> 20:07.440

20:07.474 --> 20:09.976
YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE
WHAT DR. TAUB SAID.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.844
SAID IT'S BASIC SURGERY,
BUT...

20:11.878 --> 20:13.380
IT IS.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.960
NOTHING YOU CAN DO
FOR HER HERE.

UM...

20:38.971 --> 20:40.307
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO HELP OUR DAUGHTER

20:40.340 --> 20:41.708
REACH HER DREAM.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.878
SHE'S DIFFERENT.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.648
SO YOU HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.986
I'LL MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.057

21:12.639 --> 21:13.606

21:13.640 --> 21:15.542
YOU GUYS OKAY
IF I PULL A CIRCULATING NURSE?

21:15.575 --> 21:16.809
WE GOT A TRAIN WRECK
IN O.R. TEN.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.010
YOU GOT IT.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.646
PROXIMAL END ATTACHED.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.750
CAN SOMEONE TAKE THE RETRACTORS
FROM ME?

21:23.783 --> 21:24.817
NOT REALLY.

21:24.851 --> 21:25.918
I HAVE
TO USE THE BATHROOM.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.688
I KNOW YOU'RE A ROOKIE,
BUT YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.289
I'M NOT.
IT CAN WAIT.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.060
I'M GONNA HAVE AN ACCIDENT.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.363
NEXT ONE IN LINE,
GRAB IT.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.573
WHAT'S WRONG?
HYPOTENSION.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.640
LOW CARDIAC OUTPUT.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.409
FLOAT THE SWAN.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.578
DON'T YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN SURGERY?

21:51.611 --> 21:53.846
I TOOK A BREAK.
I TOLD THEM I HAD TO PEE.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.982
YOU LIED.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.051
SMALL ONE.
BUT IT'S A GATEWAY LIE.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.953
I CARE ABOUT THE PATIENT.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.389
ANOTHER LIE.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.823
YOU CARE
ABOUT BEING EXCEPTIONAL.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.892
I TOLD HER DAD
I WAS GONNA TAKE CARE OF HER.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.094
A THIRD LIE.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.696
WELCOME
TO THE SLIPPERY SLOPE.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.531
(Taub)
RA IS 8.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.799
EQUALIZATION OF PRESSURES.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.834
MEANS SHE HAS RESTRICTIVE
PERICARDITIS.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.669
ADD THAT TO A CALCIFIED
PINEAL GLAND.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.505
(House)
WHEN IS A CALCIFIED
PINEAL GLAND

22:18.538 --> 22:20.006
NOT A CALCIFIED

22:20.039 --> 22:21.874
PINEAL GLAND?

22:21.908 --> 22:23.476
I REALIZE, TECHNICALLY,
IT'S NEVER, BUT--

22:23.510 --> 22:24.811
WHEN IT'S A GRANULOMA.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.413
IT'S WEGENER'S.
WE SHOULD START HER ON STEROIDS.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.580
(Masters)
BUT SHE HAD A HIGH CK.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.015
WEGENER'S
WOULDN'T EXPLAIN THE--

22:29.048 --> 22:30.483
DEHYDRATION DOES.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.652
(Masters)
YES. BUT THE CALCIFIED PINEAL

22:32.685 --> 22:33.686
COULD BE SARCOIDOSIS.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.157
YOU HAD ME
AT "I HAD TO PEE."

22:38.190 --> 22:39.959
BUT THIRTEEN'S RIGHT.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.128
START HER ON THREE FOLD
IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.930
MASTERS, IF YOU WANT
TO FIGHT ME ON THIS,

22:43.963 --> 22:44.964
FILL OUT A CONSULT FORM

22:44.997 --> 22:46.866
SO YOU CAN STICK AROUND.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.568
WELCOME BACK.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.103
I'M NOT BACK!

22:51.137 --> 22:53.372
I'LL JUST BE STAYING
FOR THIS CASE.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.813
YOU GOT REALLY GOOD
AT THIS LYING THING.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.692
HOPE IT WAS ONE HELL
OF A WHIZ.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.795
I RAN INTO DR. HOUSE.

23:15.828 --> 23:19.098
HE REQUESTED A SURGICAL CONSULT
FOR HIS PATIENT.

23:19.131 --> 23:22.569
HOUSE NEVER ASKS
FOR A CONSULT.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.070
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CASE,

23:24.103 --> 23:25.972
HE NEEDED
A LITTLE MORE HELP.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.040
FIRST DAY
OF YOUR SURGICAL INTERNSHIP,

23:28.074 --> 23:29.976
YOU WANT TO BE LOANED OUT
TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.445
INTERESTING CAREER MOVE.

23:32.479 --> 23:34.614
DROP THE FORM
BY MY OFFICE.

23:34.647 --> 23:35.882
DON'T STAY AWAY TOO LONG.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.651
I'M ALREADY WELL ON MY WAY
TO FORGETTING YOU.

23:45.658 --> 23:46.826
HOW ABOUT I TAKE

23:46.859 --> 23:48.795
BOTH YOU LOVELY LADIES
OUT FOR A DRINK?

23:48.828 --> 23:51.664
I'D LOVE TO.
EXCEPT I THINK YOU'RE A CRETIN.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.533
AND THE LAST TIME
SHE WAS AT A BAR

23:53.566 --> 23:54.667
WAS BALLET CLASS.

23:54.701 --> 23:56.002
I DIDN'T TAKE--

23:57.169 --> 23:58.771
OH. [snorts]
THAT'S FUNNY.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.707
I'M GONNA STAY AND RUN
A FEW EXTRA TESTS

24:00.740 --> 24:02.008
ON HOUSE'S PATIENT.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.810
THIS ONE LAB VALUE
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME.

24:03.843 --> 24:06.012
YOU'RE BACK
WITH HOUSE?

24:06.045 --> 24:08.981
MM. JUST THIS ONE CASE.
I'M NOT STAYING.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.150
I WOULD KILL FOR A CHANCE
TO WORK WITH HIM.

24:11.183 --> 24:15.522
LIKE, LITERALLY SKIN YOU
AND WEAR YOU AS A DISGUISE.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.122
[chicken clucks]

25:24.156 --> 25:25.124
[door opens]

25:39.772 --> 25:42.642
[clucking noise]

25:42.675 --> 25:44.010
[exclaims]

25:44.043 --> 25:45.177
[door locks]

25:49.649 --> 25:53.052
YOU WANT YOURS EXTRA CRISPY
OR ORIGINAL RECIPE?

26:13.072 --> 26:15.742
CHICKENS!

26:18.077 --> 26:20.079
YOU EVER GET SICK
FROM POULTRY?

26:20.112 --> 26:22.381
UM, A FEW MONTHS AGO

26:22.414 --> 26:26.285
FROM THIS PHEASANT-IN-A-CAN
MY DAD GOT ME AS A JOKE.

26:26.318 --> 26:27.720
YOU THINK
THAT'S WHY I'M SICK?

26:27.754 --> 26:28.621
I THINK THAT CAN
WAS CHOCK-FULL

26:28.655 --> 26:31.624
OF A BACTERIA
CALLED SALMONELLA ENTERITIS.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.325
LIKES TO HANG OUT
IN THE BONES.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.126
LET ME KNOW

26:34.160 --> 26:36.829
IF ANY OF THIS IS TENDER
OR PAINFUL.

26:36.863 --> 26:39.065
UM, THIS BACTERIA THING,

26:39.098 --> 26:40.900
IS THIS GOOD NEWS OR BAD?

26:40.933 --> 26:42.134
WELL, IF I'M RIGHT,

26:42.168 --> 26:45.404
THAT MEANS ALL YOU'LL NEED
ARE ANTIBIOTICS.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.407
AND YOU'LL BE, UH,
WELL, SHIPSHAPE.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.110
SORRY.
COULDN'T RESIST.

26:54.080 --> 26:58.084
DID YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THAT SAILING WAS IT FOR YOU?

26:58.117 --> 26:58.918
THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING?

26:58.951 --> 27:02.088
DIDN'T EVEN START
TILL I WAS TEN.

27:02.121 --> 27:05.224
AND AT FIRST,
I WAS NOT A FAN.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.860
CERTAINLY THERE'S PLENTY
NOT TO LIKE ABOUT SAILING.

27:07.894 --> 27:10.096
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE
SO INTO IT...

27:10.129 --> 27:11.263
OH, NO, THERE'S STILL
PLENTY OF THINGS

27:11.297 --> 27:12.965
I HATE ABOUT IT.

27:12.999 --> 27:15.434
I HATE BEING WET.
I HATE BEING COLD.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.403
I HATE EATING NOTHING
BUT FREEZE-DRIED FOOD.

27:17.436 --> 27:20.006
THAT IS QUITE
THE ENDORSEMENT.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.407
SAILING IS AMAZING.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.410
BUT DOESN'T MEAN I LOVE
EVERY SECOND ON THE BOAT.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.779
DOING WHAT YOU LOVE
MEANS DEALING

27:26.813 --> 27:28.414
WITH THINGS YOU DON'T.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.116
IF THERE WERE NOTHING
TO OVERCOME,

27:30.149 --> 27:31.918
IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT--
[winces]

27:31.951 --> 27:33.152
OW.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.960
SALMONELLA ENTERITIS
IS A NICE CATCH.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.129
THANKS. STARTING
ON THE SOFT TISSUE WINDOWS.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.066
ONCE THIS CASE IS OVER,
YOU GOING BACK TO SURGERY?

27:47.099 --> 27:49.702
THAT'S THE PLAN.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.305
I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.141
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO BACK
TO SURGERY.

27:55.174 --> 27:58.277
I JUST SAID I WAS.

27:58.310 --> 28:01.080
NO. YOU SAID
IT WAS YOUR PLAN.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.149
WHICH MEANS HOUSE
MIGHT BE RIGHT.

28:03.182 --> 28:06.919
AND YOU MIGHT BE LYING
TO YOURSELF.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.755
WOULD IT BE SO TERRIBLE?

28:08.788 --> 28:10.990
YOU CHOSE HOUSE
OVER SURGERY.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.191
MY TIME HERE CHANGED ME

28:12.224 --> 28:16.128
IN WAYS NOT EVERYONE IN MY LIFE
THOUGHT WAS FOR THE BETTER.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.798
NO MASSES.
MOVING ON TO BONE WINDOWS.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.772
ARE THOSE PEOPLE RIGHT?

28:28.274 --> 28:30.276
I THINK WHEN YOU DO CHANGE,

28:30.309 --> 28:32.244
IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE
TO GO BACK.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.147
THERE.

28:35.181 --> 28:38.184
IN THE HUMERUS.

28:39.485 --> 28:42.088
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
AN INFECTION.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.090
THAT'S BECAUSE IT LOOKS
LIKE CANCER.

28:55.234 --> 28:58.270
YOU HAVE LYMPHOID SARCOMA.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.739
A CANCER IN THE BONE
IN YOUR ARM.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.778
AM I GOING TO BE OKAY?

29:05.812 --> 29:08.214
IT'S A TREATABLE CANCER.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.182
BUT PART
OF THAT TREATMENT

29:10.216 --> 29:12.018
INVOLVES AMPUTATING
YOUR ARM.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.953
I'M SORRY.

29:13.986 --> 29:16.122
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE?

29:18.424 --> 29:20.927
WE CAN DO CHEMO AND RADIATION

29:20.960 --> 29:22.128
AFTER THE AMPUTATION.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.797
I DON'T MEAN AFTER.
I MEAN INSTEAD OF.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.165
IF I LEAVE SOON,
I STILL HAVE TIME

29:26.198 --> 29:27.366
TO BREAK THE RECORD.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.435
HONEY,
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.803
I FEEL FINE.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.471
LAST NIGHT, THEY THOUGHT
IT WAS AN INFECTION.

29:32.504 --> 29:33.539
WE KNOW IT'S CANCER.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.174
WE RAN THE BIOPSY
THREE TIMES.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.876
YOU DON'T KNOW

29:36.909 --> 29:38.044
HOW FAST--
POSTPONING THE SURGERY

29:38.077 --> 29:40.212
COULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD
THAT THE CANCER WILL SPREAD.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.815
KENDALL, YOU NEED TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT THE DOCTOR'S SAYING.

29:42.849 --> 29:43.883
I'M THINKING

29:43.916 --> 29:45.117
ABOUT THE SAIL.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.585
LIKE I HAVE
SINCE I WAS TEN.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.520
DON'T TAKE THIS
AWAY FROM ME.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.522
IT'S JUST A MONTH.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.558
I CAN TAKE EXTRA
PRECAUTIONS.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.060
I'LL SKYPE YOU EVERY DAY
AND I CAN FLY BACK

29:54.093 --> 29:55.127
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG.

29:55.161 --> 29:56.562
SHE'LL BE RISKING HER LIFE.

29:56.595 --> 29:59.131
I THINK WE NEED
TO DISCUSS THIS AS A FAMILY.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.535
YOU'RE CONSIDERING THIS?

30:07.073 --> 30:08.174
YOUR DAUGHTER'S CONDITION--

30:08.207 --> 30:11.277
THANK YOU, DR. MASTERS.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.642
SHE'S NOT BUDGING.
SHE WANTS TO LAUNCH TOMORROW.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.177
SHE'S A MINOR.

30:45.211 --> 30:48.447
YOU SIGN THE CONSENT FORM,
WE CAN DO THE SURGERY.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.183
AMPUTATION CAN BE AN EMO--

30:51.217 --> 30:53.852
SHE'S TALKED MY WIFE
INTO AGREEING WITH HER.

30:55.421 --> 30:57.589
ONE PARENT'S SIGNATURE
IS ENOUGH.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.263
SHE NEEDS YOU
TO BE A PARENT.

31:04.296 --> 31:07.266
YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO BLOW UP MY FAMILY.

31:07.299 --> 31:10.269
I'M ASKING YOU
TO SAVE YOUR FAMILY.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.073
ON HER FIRST SOLO
ATLANTIC CROSSING,

31:14.106 --> 31:16.909
SHE SCHEDULED A COURT DATE

31:16.943 --> 31:18.277
TO BECOME
AN EMANCIPATED MINOR.

31:20.146 --> 31:24.083
SHE'LL DO IT AGAIN
AND SHE'LL WIN.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.353
SHE IS GONNA DO
WHAT SHE'S GONNA DO

31:27.386 --> 31:29.188
WITH OR WITHOUT ME.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.592
I'D RATHER HAVE IT
BE WITH.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.113
I'M STUCK.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.447
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.150
CASE IS OVER.
YOU'RE BACK TO SURGERY.

32:00.519 --> 32:03.122
AND FETCH.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.624
OH, THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.226
OH, THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.095
HEY, GOOD BOY.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.231
NO ONE WILL STOP
KENDALL'S SAIL.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.599
YOU NEED TO STEP IN.

32:13.632 --> 32:16.035
SIGN ON THE DOOR
SAYS I'M A DIAGNOSTICIAN.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.603
COOL DIAGNOSIS
MEANS I'M FINISHED.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.638
SHE COULD DIE.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.707
PRETTY SURE THE LAW
OF THE LAND STATES

32:21.740 --> 32:24.076
THAT EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT
TO BE AN IDIOT.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.045
I THINK IT'S THE SECOND
AMENDMENT. FETCH!

32:28.047 --> 32:30.049
BRING IT HERE, BOY.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.584
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?

32:32.618 --> 32:35.654
YOU ARE CONSTANTLY RAILING
AGAINST HYPOCRISY,

32:35.687 --> 32:37.356
FORCING PEOPLE
TO FACE THE TRUTH.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.458
THIS TIME NOTHING?

32:39.491 --> 32:42.128
YEAH.
'CAUSE THEY FACED THE TRUTH.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.162
AND MADE A DECISION

32:43.195 --> 32:46.198
THAT WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD
KILL THEIR DAUGHTER.

32:46.232 --> 32:49.201
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

32:49.235 --> 32:52.171
I WANTED A DIAGNOSIS.
I GOT IT.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.506
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

32:54.540 --> 32:57.043
I DON'T WANT HER TO DIE.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.745
BREAK THE RULES.

33:01.247 --> 33:03.349
I CAN'T.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.154
SO COLORING INSIDE THE LINES
IS MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU

33:08.187 --> 33:10.222
THAN SAVING THIS GIRL'S LIFE?

33:11.590 --> 33:13.392
I WAS WRONG
ABOUT ONE THING,

33:13.425 --> 33:16.328
YOU ARE NOT EXCEPTIONAL.

33:16.362 --> 33:19.565
AND FETCH!

33:19.598 --> 33:21.767
HO HO HO.
OH, THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

33:21.800 --> 33:27.039
GOOD BOY. GOOD BOY.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.307
[knocking at door]

33:28.340 --> 33:29.441
DR. WILSON.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.743
UM, I'D LIKE
TO GET YOUR ADVICE

33:31.777 --> 33:33.579
ABOUT A CANCER PATIENT.

33:33.612 --> 33:36.315
KENDALL PEARSON.
ONCOLOGY ROUNDS.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.051
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT IT.
[winces]

33:39.085 --> 33:40.419
ARE YOU OKAY?

33:40.452 --> 33:42.754
YEAH, MY BACK'S ACTING UP.

33:42.788 --> 33:45.691
OH. UM...

33:45.724 --> 33:48.327
SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

33:48.360 --> 33:50.329
I WOULD KEEP TRYING
TO CONVINCE HER

33:50.362 --> 33:51.730
TO HAVE THE SURGERY.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.400
AND IF SHE KEPT SAYING NO?

33:54.433 --> 33:56.468
I WOULD JUST KEEP--
[winces]

33:56.502 --> 33:58.504
KEEP--KEEP TRYING.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.174
I KNOW THERE'S A CHICKEN
UNDER THERE.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.842
OH, THANK GOD.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.777
IT'S PECKED THROUGH

34:05.811 --> 34:08.480
ONE PAIR OF MY LOAFERS.

34:08.514 --> 34:11.450
[chicken clucks]

34:14.720 --> 34:15.754
SO THAT'S ALL YOU'D DO?

34:15.787 --> 34:18.290
THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO.

34:19.625 --> 34:20.626
IS IT?

34:22.161 --> 34:24.463
[chicken clucks]

34:31.303 --> 34:33.539
ISN'T THAT HOUSE'S CHICKEN?

34:33.572 --> 34:34.440
DISGUSTING BEASTS.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.841
I DON'T KNOW WHY I EVER AGREED
TO THIS BET.

34:35.874 --> 34:37.343
SO CALL IT OFF.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.645
AND LOSE $20?

34:39.678 --> 34:42.481
LISTEN,
HOUSE WAS IN

34:42.514 --> 34:44.750
THE EXACT SAME SITUATION
KENDALL'S IN.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.652
HE NEEDED SURGERY,
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT IT.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.187
ONCE HE WAS IN
MEDICALLY-INDUCED COMA,

34:48.220 --> 34:49.188
HIS GIRLFRIEND SIGNED

34:49.221 --> 34:51.223
THE CONSENT FORM
AS HIS PROXY.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.658
THEY WENT AHEAD
WITH THE SURGERY

34:52.691 --> 34:53.725
AGAINST HIS WILL.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.528
PROBABLY SAVED HIS LIFE.

34:56.562 --> 34:59.265
SO SHE DID THE RIGHT THING?

34:59.298 --> 35:02.401
DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ASK.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.171
(House)
FETCH!

35:06.905 --> 35:09.375
(Wilson)
NO! NO!

35:17.283 --> 35:19.151
(man)
EXCUSE ME.

35:19.185 --> 35:20.852
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS CHICKEN?

35:20.886 --> 35:22.854
DOES ANYONE KNOW

35:22.888 --> 35:24.223
WHO OWNS THE CHICKEN?

35:24.256 --> 35:27.359
THAT BIRD BELONGS TO...

35:27.393 --> 35:30.829
DR. GREGORY HOUSE.

35:30.862 --> 35:34.166
[chicken clucks]

36:07.899 --> 36:10.769
YOU NEED
TO DO THIS SURGERY.

36:10.802 --> 36:11.870
I WILL.

36:11.903 --> 36:12.938
NOW.

36:12.971 --> 36:14.806
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.508
I'M LEAVING TODAY.

36:16.542 --> 36:17.943
IT'S A STUPID RECORD.

36:17.976 --> 36:20.212
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE RECORD.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.850
I USED TO RACE
AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE.

36:24.883 --> 36:27.353
I COULD HAVE THE SLOWEST BOAT
IN THE FLEET AND I'D WIN.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.821
SO IT'S ABOUT BEING BETTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE?

36:29.855 --> 36:32.858
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANYBODY EXCEPT ME.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.895
THE OTHER RACERS
WOULD THINK I WAS CRAZY.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.930
I'D SET OFF ON SOME
TACKING ANGLE

36:38.964 --> 36:40.299
THAT MADE NO SENSE TO THEM

36:40.332 --> 36:45.471
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T SEE
WHAT I SAW.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.473
I COULD SENSE THE CHANGES
IN THE WIND

36:47.506 --> 36:48.940
BEFORE THEY EVEN HAPPENED.

36:52.578 --> 36:55.914
AT THE TOP OF THE GAME,
YOU PLAY BY DIFFERENT RULES.

37:02.821 --> 37:05.891
MEDICINE'S GONNA BURN
A LITTLE BIT.

37:20.372 --> 37:22.874
[pager beeps]

37:26.945 --> 37:28.814
(Foreman)
BRADYCARDIC ARREST.
THIRD DEGREE HEART BLOCK.

37:28.847 --> 37:29.981
LIKELY PARANEOPLASTIC
SYNDROME.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.917
WE NEED TO GET HER
TO THE O.R.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.419
FOR PACEMAKER
OR PLASMAPHERESIS.

37:33.452 --> 37:38.590
[alarm beeping]

37:38.624 --> 37:39.991
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:40.025 --> 37:41.993
THE CANCER IS CAUSING
HER HEART TO SLOW DOWN.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.430
WE HAVE TO GET HER TO THE O.R.
AND TREAT HER.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.897
THIS IS WHAT
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.966
IF THIS HAD HAPPENED AT SEA,
SHE WOULD BE DEAD.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.801
OH, MY GOD.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.804
WE NEED YOU TO SIGN
THE CONSENT FORM.

37:52.838 --> 37:55.841
AUTHORIZE US
TO AMPUTATE HER ARM.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.789
[exhales]

38:15.661 --> 38:17.429
(Chase)
SUBCLAVIAN ACCESS ESTABLISHED.

38:17.463 --> 38:19.365
TEMPORARY PACER READY.
DON'T NEED IT.

38:19.398 --> 38:20.432
PUSH CALCIUM CHLORIDE.

38:20.466 --> 38:21.533
IT'LL FIX THE HEART BLOCK.

38:23.669 --> 38:26.104
BRADYCARDIA WAS ME.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.939
YOU DID THIS?

38:27.973 --> 38:33.011
PARENTS SIGNED
THE CONSENT FORM.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.481
AMPUTATE HER ARM.

38:55.501 --> 38:56.802
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:01.607 --> 39:02.808
YOU HAD A CARDIAC EPISODE

39:02.841 --> 39:04.776
THAT REQUIRED US TO BRING YOU
INTO THE O.R.

39:04.810 --> 39:07.112
THAT CRISIS RESOLVED,
BUT--

39:07.145 --> 39:09.981
WHAT DID YOU DO?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

39:10.015 --> 39:11.149
DURING SURGERY,
WE FOUND CANCER

39:11.182 --> 39:13.018
IN A LYMPH NODE
IN YOUR NECK.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.120
SO YOU CUT OFF MY ARM?
CANCER
WAS ALREADY SPREADING.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.054
IT HAD TO BE DONE.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.590
[crying] I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T WANT THIS.

39:18.624 --> 39:20.659
IF WE HAD WAITED
UNTIL AFTER THE SAIL WAS OVER

39:20.692 --> 39:22.994
YOU WOULD HAVE DIED.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.532
[crying] THAT RECORD.
THAT WAS EVERYTHING.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.534
(Bobby)
IT WASN'T EVERYTHING.

39:28.567 --> 39:31.803
YOU HAVE A LIFE.
A FUTURE.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.472
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO DO THIS.
HOW COULD YOU?

39:33.505 --> 39:35.006
BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU.

39:36.742 --> 39:37.776
I HATE YOU.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.712
I HATE BOTH OF YOU.

39:40.746 --> 39:43.915
OKAY.

39:51.457 --> 39:53.391
MY ARM.

40:07.105 --> 40:09.608
MY ARM.

40:11.209 --> 40:16.414
DR. MASTERS, THANK YOU.

40:26.224 --> 40:29.060
[alarm rings]

40:47.212 --> 40:50.549
SOMEONE HAS GOT
THEIR POUTY FACE ON.

40:50.582 --> 40:51.717
I DID THINGS

40:51.750 --> 40:53.251
NO DOCTOR IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
WOULD DO.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.053
GOOD.

40:55.086 --> 40:58.189
I MANIPULATED,
LIED, FORGED, STOLE.

40:58.223 --> 40:59.691
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
THE SPECIFICS.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.059
MIGHT BE CALLED
TO TESTIFY.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.735
I BROKE THE RULES
BECAUSE I BELIEVED I WAS RIGHT.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.136
YOU WERE RIGHT.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.204
THEN WHY DON'T I FEEL GOOD
OR SATISFIED?

41:13.238 --> 41:15.073
INSTEAD, I JUST FEEL
LIKE THROWING UP.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.976
AND YOU'RE FOLLOWING ME TO ASK
HOW I BREAK THE RULES

41:18.009 --> 41:19.110
AND MAINTAIN
MY ROSY DEMEANOR.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.111
[knocks at door]

41:20.145 --> 41:21.713
I DIDN'T DO IT TO BE HAPPY.

41:21.747 --> 41:25.183
I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD BE.

41:25.216 --> 41:29.521
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET
WHAT YOU WANT.

41:29.555 --> 41:31.557
TO THE VICTOR
OF THE SPOILS.

41:31.590 --> 41:34.092
YOUR BIRD RECOVER OKAY?

41:34.125 --> 41:35.060
PHYSICALLY, YES.

41:35.093 --> 41:38.196
EMOTIONALLY,
IT WAS A LONG NIGHT.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.566
NEXT WEEK: FERRETS?

41:43.201 --> 41:44.970
HOUSE.

41:47.639 --> 41:51.209
I CAN'T DO IT.

41:51.242 --> 41:53.244
I'M LEAVING.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.783
SURGERY?

42:00.886 --> 42:03.221
I...DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

42:03.254 --> 42:06.191
BUT I DO KNOW
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.103
NOTHING WILL EVER
BE SIMPLE AGAIN.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.208
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

42:26.612 --> 42:32.083
* YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET
WHAT YOU WANT *

42:32.117 --> 42:35.320
* AND IF YOU TRY SOMETIME

42:35.353 --> 42:37.723
* YOU'LL FIND

42:37.756 --> 42:40.191

42:40.225 --> 42:41.727
[chicken clucks]

42:44.362 --> 42:46.732
[laughs]

42:48.133 --> 42:52.103
* YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET
WHAT YOU WANT *

42:53.972 --> 42:56.775
* BUT IF YOU TRY SOMETIMES

42:56.808 --> 42:59.177
* WELL, YOU MIGHT FIND
