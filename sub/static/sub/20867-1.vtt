01:35.021 --> 01:38.149
Excuse me do you
speak any English?

01:40.276 --> 01:42.153
Do you speak English, anyone?

01:42.278 --> 01:43.113
English?

01:43.238 --> 01:44.906
<i>Se habla Ingles.</i>

01:45.031 --> 01:46.699
You speak English?

01:46.825 --> 01:48.618
Si, yes!

01:48.743 --> 01:49.743
Yes, yes!

01:51.621 --> 01:53.415

01:54.749 --> 01:58.711

three, um, three um,

01:58.837 --> 02:00.815

me but not really like me

02:00.839 --> 02:02.549
but they're Americans.

02:02.674 --> 02:04.634
- Ah Americanos.
- Si Americanos.

02:05.844 --> 02:06.844
Yes?

02:06.886 --> 02:07.886
Yes.

02:07.887 --> 02:08.596
- Oh!
- I've seen plenty

02:08.721 --> 02:10.514
of them, everywhere!

02:12.851 --> 02:15.937
That's uh, that's uh
just not gonna help.

02:16.062 --> 02:17.062
Uh, oh boy.

02:20.483 --> 02:22.444
Oh, I need to find them.

02:24.863 --> 02:25.863
I need...

02:26.739 --> 02:28.241
They're around somewhere.

02:29.909 --> 02:32.537
Yeah, they're
around somewhere.

02:32.662 --> 02:33.662
That's brilliant.

02:36.791 --> 02:37.834
Oh boy.

02:39.502 --> 02:40.753
Oh hi.

02:43.923 --> 02:47.051
I have no idea what you're saying, but ok.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.183
Hey hey hey hey,
where you going?

02:56.144 --> 02:57.353
Okay, I'll go.

02:59.105 --> 03:00.105
Hey!

03:01.399 --> 03:02.399
Hey-

03:04.194 --> 03:05.653
She a loco girl.

03:05.778 --> 03:06.945
That's okay.

03:06.946 --> 03:10.783
She's harmless, sort of.

03:10.909 --> 03:14.746
But, if you're looking
for something unusual,

03:15.914 --> 03:18.666
I can do much better than that.

03:20.084 --> 03:22.587
No no no, I gotta, I
need to find my friends.

03:22.712 --> 03:25.715
I think you
should come with me.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.883
Come.

03:28.968 --> 03:30.970
We'll find your friends.

03:32.764 --> 03:35.600
Hey do you speak English?

03:35.725 --> 03:36.725
No.

03:36.809 --> 03:37.644
- Vamos!
- You'll help me

03:37.769 --> 03:39.479
find my friends?

03:39.604 --> 03:41.314
- Vamos.
- Okay, vamos.

03:42.982 --> 03:44.692
Another word I don't
know what that means.

03:45.985 --> 03:47.570
We go! We go...

03:50.865 --> 03:51.865
Ah, oh.

03:57.163 --> 03:58.163
I get it.

03:59.123 --> 04:01.834
You're a fortune teller, right?

04:04.045 --> 04:06.089
Ok, I'm on it...

04:06.214 --> 04:08.007
I need to find my friends.

04:09.759 --> 04:12.428
Oh don't doubt the
supernatural my friend.

04:12.554 --> 04:14.847
Nah, I don't really
believe in that stuff, so...

04:14.973 --> 04:18.476
It's the day of the dead.

04:18.601 --> 04:21.563
Time to set aside
the world you know.

04:21.688 --> 04:25.108
It's not necessary to
believe, it just is.

04:25.233 --> 04:26.233
Uh hm.

04:27.443 --> 04:29.153
Think of it as
entertainment if you like.

04:29.279 --> 04:31.030
Okay, let's do this.

04:32.699 --> 04:36.744
Now, in order for us to
search into the deepest

04:36.869 --> 04:40.873
part of the universe,
we must relax our minds.

04:41.791 --> 04:43.084
So drink!

04:43.209 --> 04:44.209
Drink.

04:47.005 --> 04:48.047
Ah!

04:48.172 --> 04:50.133
Just one drink and then
we go find my friends.

04:50.258 --> 04:52.385
Drink.

04:54.679 --> 04:55.679
Oh.

05:26.085 --> 05:27.086
Ah, yes, yes.

08:17.006 --> 08:19.550
Hello, hello,
wake up, wake up!

08:25.264 --> 08:26.264
Oh God!

08:30.019 --> 08:31.019
Wake up!

08:32.270 --> 08:33.270
Fuck!

09:15.064 --> 09:16.291
Allison what are
you doing here?

09:16.315 --> 09:18.192
Your shift was
over two hours ago.

09:18.317 --> 09:20.653
Uh, guess
my watch stopped.

09:20.778 --> 09:21.988
Sure.

09:22.113 --> 09:22.989
You know that girl in there

09:23.114 --> 09:24.156
has been asking for you.

09:24.282 --> 09:25.283
Oh she has?

09:25.324 --> 09:26.450
I'll go and check on her.

09:26.576 --> 09:27.785
Seems like a great girl.

09:27.910 --> 09:29.327
She is.

09:29.328 --> 09:30.556
You bought her that
bike that was in there

09:30.580 --> 09:32.832
the other day, didn't you?

09:34.125 --> 09:36.334
She's been in
ER for three days.

09:36.335 --> 09:38.336
Her parent's can't even
afford to admit her,

09:38.337 --> 09:40.214
let alone buy her a bike.

09:40.339 --> 09:41.441
You know she's
not gonna be around

09:41.465 --> 09:43.426
long enough to enjoy it?

09:44.343 --> 09:46.554
She will, don't say that.

10:08.117 --> 10:11.495
Oh my God, Stupa!

10:11.621 --> 10:13.497
I thought you went
back to India?

10:13.623 --> 10:15.373
No my in-laws came
from India, and they

10:15.374 --> 10:16.602
don't want me to travel unless...

10:16.626 --> 10:18.377
How, you too?

10:18.502 --> 10:20.212
You didn't even
tell me about this!

10:20.338 --> 10:21.047
Surprised?

10:21.172 --> 10:22.381
Crazy!

10:24.258 --> 10:24.884
Thank you.

10:25.009 --> 10:26.427
Thank you.

10:26.552 --> 10:27.386
Hello.

10:27.386 --> 10:28.137
There she is...

10:28.262 --> 10:29.388
How are you?

10:29.430 --> 10:30.473
I'm good.

10:30.598 --> 10:31.849
I was getting a little worried

10:31.974 --> 10:32.850
you weren't coming
back to the States.

10:32.975 --> 10:34.235
Oh my God are you crazy?

10:34.360 --> 10:35.194
I wouldn't miss this even

10:35.195 --> 10:37.271
if I have to fire asses all the way there.

10:37.396 --> 10:38.898
Get your butt in there.

10:39.023 --> 10:40.398
How was Paris?

10:40.399 --> 10:42.068
Oh my God Ali, it is amazing.

10:42.193 --> 10:43.401
Yeah?

10:43.402 --> 10:45.162
I booked a contract
to design kids clothes.

10:45.279 --> 10:46.447
That's awesome.

10:46.572 --> 10:48.282
Thank you.

10:48.407 --> 10:50.534
So when am I gonna see
you on fashion magazines?

10:50.660 --> 10:53.411
I don't plan on being
famous anytime soon,

10:53.412 --> 10:54.651
but enough about me.

10:54.813 --> 10:55.813
Look at you.

10:56.749 --> 10:58.185
That little turkey
is about to pop out.

10:58.209 --> 11:00.086
Hey, enough with
the turkey stuff.

11:00.211 --> 11:02.630
I'm packing a lady
killer in here.

11:02.755 --> 11:04.048
No doubt you are.

11:04.173 --> 11:06.133
And soon you're gonna have two.

11:06.258 --> 11:08.928
Okay, now I'm feeling
a little uncomfortable.

11:09.053 --> 11:10.054
Tara.

11:10.179 --> 11:12.098
Great seeing ya.

11:12.223 --> 11:14.308
Okay, you know you're
not public property.

11:14.433 --> 11:16.143
Or I would have to kill you.

11:16.268 --> 11:18.646
Well fortunately for me you
couldn't kill a cockroach.

11:18.771 --> 11:19.771
Don't count on it.

11:21.065 --> 11:23.401
Best behavior you two.

11:26.487 --> 11:28.197
So how'd you get
wrapped up into this?

11:28.322 --> 11:31.200
Poker night was canceled.

11:31.325 --> 11:34.078
Why does this scarf
look so familiar?

11:34.203 --> 11:38.124
Ali has one similar to
it with her initials on it.

11:38.249 --> 11:41.168
We got it whenever we
were visiting New York.

11:41.293 --> 11:42.461
Very pretty.

11:44.672 --> 11:45.881
You look good.

11:47.925 --> 11:49.427
You look good.

11:50.302 --> 11:51.345
I like your shirt.

11:51.470 --> 11:52.096
You do?

11:52.221 --> 11:53.097
You should know.

11:53.222 --> 11:54.724
You're a fashionista,
right?

11:54.849 --> 11:56.809
True.

11:56.934 --> 11:58.477
So children's clothing?

11:58.602 --> 12:00.354
Children's clothing, yes.

12:00.479 --> 12:01.498
- They're so lucky.
- I love kids.

12:01.522 --> 12:02.398
So lucky.

12:02.481 --> 12:03.691
Thanks.

12:03.816 --> 12:05.151
You're lucky too.

12:05.276 --> 12:05.901
Thanks.

12:06.027 --> 12:06.777
Look at this.

12:06.902 --> 12:07.945
Baby shower.

12:08.070 --> 12:09.196
Amazing, so much fun.

12:09.321 --> 12:10.489
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:10.614 --> 12:11.490
What are we
talking about here?

12:11.491 --> 12:12.533
Baby showers.

12:12.658 --> 12:13.492
It's in the freezer,

12:13.534 --> 12:14.368
<i>There's ice cream...</i>

12:14.493 --> 12:15.327
I know she has her...

12:15.453 --> 12:16.245
Okay, hang on.

12:16.370 --> 12:18.122
Alright everybody,
quiet down, quiet down.

12:18.247 --> 12:20.833
Down.

12:20.958 --> 12:21.958
Very good.

12:23.044 --> 12:24.502
Dear friends and family.

12:24.503 --> 12:27.048
It is our privilege to
be part of this wonderful

12:27.173 --> 12:29.633
and exciting baby shower.

12:29.759 --> 12:32.636
Our darling Ali, not only is she

12:32.762 --> 12:35.347
a loving and dedicated
nurse to sick kids,

12:35.473 --> 12:38.267
but she is also a
very nice human being.

12:38.392 --> 12:39.602
And I know
she's gonna make

12:39.727 --> 12:41.729
an awesome mother too.

12:41.854 --> 12:43.189
Thank you.

12:43.314 --> 12:45.816
So we wish her luck,
'cause she'll need it.

12:45.941 --> 12:48.277
I know, I got two
kids of my own.

12:48.402 --> 12:49.402
Right?

12:49.487 --> 12:50.279
Yay!

12:50.404 --> 12:51.530
Thank you guys, thank you.

12:53.365 --> 12:54.200
Thank you guys.

12:54.325 --> 12:56.202
You guys are all awesome.

12:56.327 --> 12:57.411
Thank you.

12:57.536 --> 12:59.016
Alright, enough mushy stuff.

12:59.051 --> 12:59.942
Let's open presents.

13:01.483 --> 13:03.459
Boy it's dark Al.

13:03.542 --> 13:04.543
What is it?

13:06.712 --> 13:10.424
Oh wow, it's the eclipse, I
read about it this morning.

13:10.549 --> 13:12.009
Wow.

13:12.134 --> 13:15.304
I have not seen an eclipse
since I was a child.

13:15.429 --> 13:17.556
Ali, come and take a look.

13:17.598 --> 13:18.808
That's so beautiful.

13:18.933 --> 13:19.975
What is it?

13:22.561 --> 13:23.561
Oh.

13:29.151 --> 13:30.671
Doesn't it kinda
put you in the mood?

13:31.737 --> 13:34.031
No no, not what
I was thinking.

13:34.156 --> 13:36.117
Wow that really lame you guys.

13:36.242 --> 13:37.242
In the mood, seriously?

13:37.326 --> 13:38.911
Over an eclipse?

13:39.036 --> 13:40.436
And that is definitely
what got you

13:40.538 --> 13:41.538
in this situation.

13:44.041 --> 13:45.584
What's the matter?

13:45.626 --> 13:47.585
In my culture we believe
that watching an eclipse

13:47.586 --> 13:49.588
is bad luck for pregnant women.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.215
Why,
what's wrong with it?

13:51.340 --> 13:53.509
Because it can cause
birth defects or miscarriage

13:53.592 --> 13:57.595
causing
for an unborn child.

13:57.596 --> 13:58.848
I'm sorry.

13:58.973 --> 14:00.432
I must leave.

14:00.558 --> 14:01.558
I'm so sorry.

14:04.061 --> 14:05.061
I swear.

14:14.363 --> 14:15.573
Hey, you okay?

14:17.616 --> 14:18.616
Babes?

14:19.451 --> 14:20.452
You Okay?

14:25.457 --> 14:26.457
Yeah.

14:27.793 --> 14:30.004
I'm gonna go get the cake.

14:46.645 --> 14:48.522
Oh my God, oh my God.

14:48.647 --> 14:50.274
Baby, what happened?

14:50.399 --> 14:52.526
I don't know.

14:52.651 --> 14:53.777
Baby what happened?

14:53.903 --> 14:55.654
I told you I don't know.

14:55.696 --> 14:57.656
Oh my God! She is
losing way too much blood.

14:57.781 --> 14:59.092
We need to get
her to the hospital.

14:59.116 --> 15:01.157
Tara, go get some
towels, call 911.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.192
Go now!

15:03.662 --> 15:06.457
It's gonna be okay.

15:07.499 --> 15:08.499
Hurry up!

15:12.129 --> 15:13.672
It's gonna be fine.

15:15.549 --> 15:17.009
Hi, I'm Dr.

15:17.134 --> 15:18.802
Jones.

15:18.928 --> 15:20.638
Don't worry, we'll
take good care of you.

15:20.679 --> 15:22.598
How are you feeling?

15:22.681 --> 15:23.599
Forget about me.

15:23.682 --> 15:25.226
How's my baby?

15:25.351 --> 15:29.313
He's alright, but looks like
you've lost a lotta blood.

15:29.438 --> 15:32.358
And the baby's
heart rate is low.

15:32.483 --> 15:34.318
He's in distress.

15:34.443 --> 15:36.237
Is he gonna be okay?

15:36.362 --> 15:38.739
We're inducing labor
to save your son's life.

15:38.864 --> 15:39.740
No, no, no.

15:39.865 --> 15:41.617
He's not ready.

15:41.700 --> 15:42.534
You have to be calm.

15:42.660 --> 15:43.410
What if he doesn't make it?

15:43.535 --> 15:44.679
Hey, hey, hey, what is that?

15:44.703 --> 15:47.623
You're the strongest
person I know.

15:47.706 --> 15:48.892
Okay, I'm
gonna need you to breathe.

15:48.916 --> 15:49.708
I love you.

15:49.709 --> 15:50.709
I know.

15:50.751 --> 15:51.627
Your going to be fine.

15:51.710 --> 15:52.753
Baby's gonna be fine.

15:52.878 --> 15:54.022
Okay, we just have
to deliver this baby

15:54.046 --> 15:55.381
so you can be alright.

15:55.506 --> 15:56.691
I'm gonna need
you to push hard, push.

15:56.715 --> 15:57.466
Need you to take a breath.

15:57.591 --> 15:58.050
I can't bear it anymore.

15:58.175 --> 15:58.717
Breathe, breathe deep.

15:58.759 --> 15:59.593
Please, please.

15:59.718 --> 16:01.220
Again, in out, now push.

16:01.345 --> 16:02.346
Push hard.

16:02.471 --> 16:03.740
Ali, the baby's
heart rate is low.

16:03.764 --> 16:04.640
You're doing great, yo

16:04.723 --> 16:05.557
u're doing great baby.

16:05.683 --> 16:06.433
Okay, one more.

16:06.558 --> 16:07.725
He's crowning.

16:07.726 --> 16:10.020
One more breath, one more
breath and push hard.

16:10.145 --> 16:11.145
Push!

16:12.606 --> 16:13.606
He's come.

16:15.484 --> 16:16.568
God, help us.

16:22.616 --> 16:23.742
Doc?

16:25.286 --> 16:27.413
What's he doing?

16:27.538 --> 16:28.538
Doc?

16:28.580 --> 16:31.083
What's he doing?

16:31.208 --> 16:33.502
Doctor Jones?

16:33.627 --> 16:34.627
He's here.

16:39.717 --> 16:42.094
You did it, did it.

16:53.897 --> 16:55.107
Here you go.

16:59.778 --> 17:01.572
Welcome to the world.

17:03.574 --> 17:05.701
Christopher Neron Dunn.

17:07.411 --> 17:08.411
Neron?

17:09.788 --> 17:10.873
Neron.

17:10.998 --> 17:13.666
Hey, made you smile.

17:13.791 --> 17:15.336
He likes it.

17:15.461 --> 17:16.563
Well I guess if
he doesn't like it

17:16.587 --> 17:19.548
he can change it
when he's older.

17:19.673 --> 17:21.508
I think he sounds
like a linebacker.

17:21.633 --> 17:24.553
Somebody you don't
wanna mess with.

17:24.678 --> 17:25.887
Helookstough.

17:26.012 --> 17:29.141
He's definitely gonna
be a linebacker.

17:29.266 --> 17:30.809
You're stupid.

17:30.934 --> 17:32.811
Your daddy's stupid.

17:32.853 --> 17:33.896
That is not true.

17:34.021 --> 17:36.607
Don't you believe your mommy.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.826
Strange weather we're having.

17:47.868 --> 17:51.497
Yeah! Looks like
a storm is coming.

17:51.622 --> 17:54.833
I've never seen
clouds like that before.

17:55.876 --> 17:57.920
Maybe we're gonna get a tornado.

17:58.045 --> 17:59.338
Yeah.

17:59.463 --> 18:00.589
We're gonna get a tornado.

18:00.714 --> 18:02.723
We get those in
California every day.

18:03.818 --> 18:05.552
I think you stole
mommy's brain cells.

18:05.677 --> 18:06.553
Yes you did.

18:06.678 --> 18:07.679
Nuh uh.

18:09.306 --> 18:12.603
Congratulations new mom.

18:12.684 --> 18:13.869
How's the new mom feeling?

18:14.152 --> 18:15.604
Hey, how 'bout the new dad?

18:15.729 --> 18:17.344
The new dad doesn't
have a vagina,

18:17.379 --> 18:18.249
so I'm sure he's
feeling pretty perky.

18:18.273 --> 18:19.525
Yeah.

18:19.650 --> 18:21.044
Okay, she's a bad
influence on the baby.

18:21.068 --> 18:22.068
Move.

18:23.112 --> 18:24.696
I'll take that.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.075
Oh he is so precious.

18:30.869 --> 18:32.955
And of course is my
luck, my car broke down

18:33.080 --> 18:34.832
so I had to take a cab.

18:34.873 --> 18:36.542
Oh Tara you didn't
have to do that.

18:36.667 --> 18:37.793
Yes, I did.

18:39.420 --> 18:41.839
So you finally have
your little prince.

18:41.880 --> 18:42.965
I Um hmmm.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.843
And I better make
the most of him.

18:46.885 --> 18:49.596
Doctor says I
can't have another.

18:49.721 --> 18:51.014
But, no, Allison,

18:51.932 --> 18:53.600
you can adopt one.

18:53.725 --> 18:54.725
Yeah.

18:54.768 --> 18:56.603
Listen, I envy you.

18:56.728 --> 18:59.857
You are a strong
woman, a kick ass wife.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.902
And the 2nd most
beautiful woman under me.

19:06.655 --> 19:08.407
So no more sob stories.

19:08.532 --> 19:09.658
Okay.

19:09.783 --> 19:12.661
You have a beautiful
boy and husband.

19:12.786 --> 19:13.912
So bask in it.

19:15.122 --> 19:17.416
It only comes once.

19:17.541 --> 19:19.376
I love you.

19:19.501 --> 19:20.918
I know you do, everybody does.

19:23.755 --> 19:24.631
So I can't stay long.

19:24.756 --> 19:26.633
I have to head home here soon.

19:26.758 --> 19:27.758
Okay.

19:28.969 --> 19:32.639
Well you need Kevin
to give you a ride?

19:32.764 --> 19:34.224
If you don't mind.

19:35.559 --> 19:38.228
Are you sure you'd be
okay here by yourself?

19:38.353 --> 19:40.189
Yeah, of course.

19:40.314 --> 19:41.732
Why wouldn't I be?

19:52.951 --> 19:56.872
So, you think I'm
beautiful huh?

20:03.921 --> 20:06.673
Don't let it get to your head.

20:09.009 --> 20:12.638
I swear if Neron has your
ego, the world is screwed.

20:12.763 --> 20:14.515
Yeah well.

20:20.729 --> 20:21.980
So beautiful.

20:34.868 --> 20:37.079
Thanks for the ride beautiful.

20:38.747 --> 20:40.874
Third time's a charm.

20:44.753 --> 20:49.091
I swear your son is
gonna be a mess of trouble.

20:49.216 --> 20:52.761
My God are you serious?

20:52.886 --> 20:53.929
What's wrong?

20:54.012 --> 20:55.722
Dammit.

20:55.847 --> 20:58.433
Oh my God are you serious?

20:58.559 --> 20:59.559
Dammit.

21:00.477 --> 21:02.771
I dropped my keys in the cab.

21:06.567 --> 21:07.985
Got a bobby pin?

21:10.821 --> 21:11.822
I don't know.

21:20.497 --> 21:21.832
That'll work.

21:26.712 --> 21:29.006
Do you even know
what you're doing?

21:29.047 --> 21:31.133
I'd like to think so.

21:32.884 --> 21:34.678
I used to break
into Allison's dorm

21:34.803 --> 21:38.265
so she wouldn't get
caught coming in late.

21:41.018 --> 21:42.018
Tada.

21:44.021 --> 21:45.397
Well look at you.

21:45.522 --> 21:47.816
Yep, my ill spent
youth pays off.

21:47.941 --> 21:49.067
I know this is no dorm,

21:49.192 --> 21:52.779
but I at least owe you
another cup of coffee.

22:19.139 --> 22:22.392
So you live here
by yourself, right?

22:24.102 --> 22:26.605
Uh, yeah, about four years.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.902
Coffee should be ready
in just a minute.

22:37.324 --> 22:39.951
You know Ali is really lucky.

22:41.119 --> 22:43.246
She has a new baby and you.

22:46.124 --> 22:47.751
A complete family.

22:49.544 --> 22:51.129
I'm sorry.

22:51.171 --> 22:55.625
I think I got... a migraine
coming on or something.

22:57.010 --> 22:58.679
Do you get those often?

22:58.804 --> 23:00.055
No, not really.

23:02.140 --> 23:06.144
Uh here, let me go
check my medicine cabinet.

23:29.167 --> 23:30.167
Shit!

23:30.168 --> 23:31.168
Oh my God.

23:32.170 --> 23:35.882
You scared the
living crap outta me.

23:36.007 --> 23:39.177
Um, what do you
take for headaches?

23:39.219 --> 23:42.055
I don't know, what do you got?

23:42.180 --> 23:43.807
Ali does this weird
massage thing.

23:43.932 --> 23:46.685
Something she picked up from
one of those doctor shows.

23:46.810 --> 23:49.186
It's strange but
it actually works.

23:49.187 --> 23:51.815
Um well, Ali isn't
here, so you're just gonna

23:51.940 --> 23:54.901
have to settle for aspirin.

23:55.026 --> 23:58.195
Ah, that stuff doesn't
settle well with my stomach.

23:58.196 --> 23:59.489
No biggie.

23:59.614 --> 24:00.614
I'll just head back.

24:00.657 --> 24:02.199
Try to sleep it off.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.285
No.

24:03.410 --> 24:06.079
No, you're not driving
feeling that way.

24:06.204 --> 24:07.204
Come here.

24:13.462 --> 24:14.462
Sit.

24:17.424 --> 24:19.092
I'm serious.

24:19.217 --> 24:21.219
I don't do well with aspirin.

24:22.429 --> 24:24.514
You made that
clear the first time.

24:34.232 --> 24:37.068
You're gonna
get me in trouble.

24:38.236 --> 24:39.237
Too late.

26:51.536 --> 26:52.662
Are you okay?

27:00.128 --> 27:02.672
I'm gonna go get
a cup of coffee.

27:04.257 --> 27:05.717
I gotta get going-

27:08.386 --> 27:10.096
Gotta check in on Ali.

27:38.166 --> 27:39.250
Becky!

27:39.376 --> 27:41.294
Oh, Doctor Jones?

27:41.419 --> 27:42.754
What are you doing?

27:42.879 --> 27:44.673
I'm just heading home.

27:44.798 --> 27:45.798
I'm fine.

27:45.882 --> 27:46.716
Hop in.

27:46.841 --> 27:47.467
Let me give you a ride.

27:47.592 --> 27:48.426
No, I'm good.

27:48.427 --> 27:49.761
Becky, get in the car.

27:49.886 --> 27:50.679
Come on.

27:50.804 --> 27:52.138
Okay, thanks.

27:54.224 --> 27:56.433
So how long you been
in this neighborhood?

27:56.434 --> 27:59.436
Ah, about 3 or 4 years.

27:59.437 --> 28:02.857
Well and this makes it be
easy for working for me, right?

28:02.983 --> 28:06.444
Yeah, working for you
is very interesting.

28:09.114 --> 28:09.739
What?

28:09.864 --> 28:11.533
You want hazard pay?

28:11.658 --> 28:14.327
That sounds about right, yes.

28:14.452 --> 28:15.554
I don't think it's too bad.

28:15.578 --> 28:17.163
You do a great job though.

28:18.415 --> 28:19.457
Thank you.

28:22.210 --> 28:23.086
- Oh, here we go.
- Don't wanna break

28:23.211 --> 28:24.587
any laws here.
Right here.

28:24.713 --> 28:25.713
Perfect.

28:26.715 --> 28:28.465
Alright Beck.

28:28.466 --> 28:29.342
See you at work.

28:29.467 --> 28:30.468
Thank you so much.

28:30.593 --> 28:33.221
Alright, take
care of yourself.

28:33.346 --> 28:34.889
You didn't have to.

29:44.959 --> 29:46.044
Hey-

29:46.169 --> 29:47.879
- I think Neron is hungry.

29:48.004 --> 29:49.523
Do you think I should
give him his milk?

29:49.547 --> 29:51.800
Yeah, yeah there's a
bottle in the fridge.

29:51.925 --> 29:53.134
Okay.

30:02.352 --> 30:03.353
MY angel.

30:23.581 --> 30:24.581
Ma'am?

30:26.417 --> 30:29.838
Ma'am, may I ask you
a personal question?

30:29.963 --> 30:31.506
Yeah, sure.

30:32.966 --> 30:35.343
Did you have a natural
delivery when you had him?

30:35.468 --> 30:36.468
Yeah.

30:37.262 --> 30:38.596
Why, what's wrong?

30:40.640 --> 30:43.017
Nothing, it's just,

30:43.143 --> 30:45.895
it's just I just
never hear him cry.

30:46.020 --> 30:47.020
Never.

30:49.941 --> 30:51.901
Well, Maria he's fine.

30:53.611 --> 30:57.448
I mean when a child is born
they have to acclimate.

30:57.574 --> 30:59.367
They're going through
a lot of changes,

30:59.492 --> 31:02.662
their bodies, their
behavior patterns,

31:02.787 --> 31:03.913
their sleeping patterns.

31:04.038 --> 31:05.832
He's just adjusting.

31:05.957 --> 31:10.253
Did he hurt his head or
neck when he was in delivery?

31:10.378 --> 31:11.379
No.

31:12.380 --> 31:13.715
Why would you say that?

31:13.840 --> 31:15.091
What's wrong with his head?

31:15.216 --> 31:16.216
He's fine.

31:18.595 --> 31:19.947
Nothing, it's
just that in Mexico,

31:19.971 --> 31:23.391
when a kid is born
before his or her time,

31:25.101 --> 31:26.519
it's not a good thing.

31:26.644 --> 31:28.646
Maria, we live in America.

31:29.814 --> 31:31.648
Okay, you live in America

31:31.649 --> 31:34.277
and I don't mean
this to sound rude,

31:34.402 --> 31:38.489
but, we don't have those
superstitions in this country.

31:38.615 --> 31:39.615
Okay?

31:41.910 --> 31:43.286
I understand.

31:44.495 --> 31:45.495
Good.

31:46.831 --> 31:48.311
Now Kevin and I are
going out tonight.

31:48.416 --> 31:50.667
Are you okay to watch Neron?

31:50.668 --> 31:51.836
Yes, Senora.

31:52.795 --> 31:54.756
Hey babe, I'm home.

31:54.881 --> 31:56.674
We're in the nursery.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.220
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:04.682 --> 32:07.101
- There's my little linebacker.

32:07.227 --> 32:09.646
Yeah, there he is, sleeping.

32:11.564 --> 32:13.900
Mommy is gonna go
and check tickets

32:14.025 --> 32:15.360
and you have to be ready.

32:15.485 --> 32:17.570
We're leaving in half an hour.

32:17.695 --> 32:18.738
Why?

32:18.863 --> 32:23.409
We're going to that
musical show, remember?

32:23.534 --> 32:24.534
Shit.

32:25.912 --> 32:28.539
Alright, let me
take a quick shower.

32:28.665 --> 32:31.209
Mommy is gonna bore
daddy to death.

32:31.334 --> 32:33.378
Wish me luck buddy.

32:33.503 --> 32:34.623
He's gonna be alright sir.

32:37.340 --> 32:38.715
Yeah, watch this.

32:38.716 --> 32:42.762
Hey Babes! What's the name of
the musical we're gonna see.

32:42.887 --> 32:46.349
It's "The Legally
Blonde, the Mystery".

33:30.310 --> 33:31.310
Kevin?

33:32.562 --> 33:33.896
The lights again.

33:35.189 --> 33:36.858
Maria, I want to
tell you that the...

33:38.443 --> 33:39.443
Maria!

33:41.529 --> 33:42.529
Maria.

33:54.792 --> 33:55.792
Yes?

33:56.586 --> 33:58.212
Are you okay ma'am?

33:59.672 --> 34:01.392
Hey babes, have
you been shaving your legs

34:01.424 --> 34:02.884
with my razor again?

34:05.386 --> 34:06.386
Huh?

34:09.931 --> 34:11.893
Did you hear me babes?

34:13.143 --> 34:14.562
Yeah.

34:14.687 --> 34:15.521
Are you okay?

34:15.646 --> 34:16.647
Yeah.

34:19.067 --> 34:20.275
I uh-

34:20.400 --> 34:21.527
- We need to go.

34:21.652 --> 34:24.072
Doesn't the show
start in half an hour?

34:24.197 --> 34:25.572
Yeah.

34:25.697 --> 34:26.574
Let's go.

34:26.699 --> 34:27.742
Okay.

34:40.838 --> 34:42.840
Alright, what's wrong?

34:44.842 --> 34:46.135
Huh?

34:46.260 --> 34:49.764
You haven't said a
word since we left.

34:50.848 --> 34:51.848
Allison!

34:53.476 --> 34:55.853
Did you see Maria's eyes?

34:55.978 --> 34:56.978
What?

34:57.021 --> 34:59.273
Did you see her eyes?

34:59.399 --> 35:00.959
No, what would I
have been looking for

35:01.025 --> 35:02.693
had I seen 'em?

35:02.819 --> 35:04.195
Just forget it.

35:05.196 --> 35:06.196
No, Ali.

35:07.532 --> 35:09.075
Tell me what's wrong.

35:11.244 --> 35:12.912
Okay well this is
gonna sound weird.

35:13.037 --> 35:14.872
But I know what I saw.

35:16.457 --> 35:19.175
When I went to ask
Maria something,

35:19.176 --> 35:21.379
her... her eyes were...

35:21.879 --> 35:22.547
They were what?

35:22.672 --> 35:24.424
They looked black.

35:26.426 --> 35:27.885
Baby, they're dark
brown like mine.

35:27.927 --> 35:30.179
No, like completely black,

35:30.304 --> 35:32.640
like the pupils were
dilated or something.

35:32.765 --> 35:33.850
I don't know.

35:33.891 --> 35:36.144
Okay, maybe she was
on speed or something.

35:36.269 --> 35:37.770
Kevin.

35:37.895 --> 35:38.813
What?

35:38.896 --> 35:41.649
I mean babe, what you're
saying makes no sense.

35:41.774 --> 35:42.567
Black eyes?

35:42.692 --> 35:44.902
Yes, and I know what I saw.

35:48.072 --> 35:49.906
Alright, well were you
wearing your glasses?

35:49.907 --> 35:51.187
What is that supposed to mean?

35:51.284 --> 35:52.702
Nothing.

35:53.870 --> 35:54.911
It was just a question.

35:54.912 --> 35:55.913
Whatever.

35:57.790 --> 35:58.875
Look.

36:00.501 --> 36:01.961
You're tired.

36:02.086 --> 36:03.629
Yeah.

36:03.754 --> 36:04.213
You've been kicking ass
at this parenting thing

36:04.338 --> 36:05.631
since day one.

36:05.756 --> 36:09.635
I haven't exactly been
fair as far as keeping up.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.804
I'm not saying that you sound...

36:11.929 --> 36:12.929
Crazy?

36:14.098 --> 36:15.475
Yes.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.853
I'm just saying that
you need a break.

36:20.605 --> 36:22.857
This show is a good start.

36:25.943 --> 36:26.944
Come on baby.

37:52.572 --> 37:56.409
Mimi's on
fast, Mimi goes first.

38:19.390 --> 38:20.390
Oh my God.

38:21.892 --> 38:22.892
Oh my God.

38:32.612 --> 38:33.988
Are you okay?

38:35.865 --> 38:36.866
Yeah.

38:38.909 --> 38:42.872
I'm, I just have, I'm
gonna go use the restroom.

39:13.569 --> 39:14.569
Oh my God!

39:15.780 --> 39:17.323
Oh my God, oh my God!

39:19.116 --> 39:20.116
No!

39:41.013 --> 39:41.639
Everything Okay?

39:41.764 --> 39:42.807
She didn't answer.

39:42.932 --> 39:43.557
Who?

39:43.683 --> 39:44.433
Maria.

39:44.558 --> 39:45.851
You called her?

39:45.976 --> 39:48.896
Yes and she didn't answer.

39:49.021 --> 39:50.457
She's probably tied up
with the baby or something.

39:50.481 --> 39:51.481
I'm sure she's fine.

39:51.524 --> 39:53.859
No, Maria always answers.

39:55.152 --> 39:56.152
Babe.

40:02.702 --> 40:05.913
Look, you can stay,
but I am leaving.

40:06.038 --> 40:07.081
Okay?

40:14.171 --> 40:15.171
Dammit.

40:15.923 --> 40:19.093
I was just starting
to enjoy this crap.

40:20.553 --> 40:21.553
Maria?

40:25.516 --> 40:26.809
Come here baby.

40:26.934 --> 40:27.934
Okay.

40:27.977 --> 40:28.978
Maria!

40:30.354 --> 40:31.354
Maria!

40:33.023 --> 40:34.023
Kevin!

40:34.066 --> 40:34.692
<i>Yeah?</i>

40:34.817 --> 40:35.651
Maria's not here.

40:35.776 --> 40:38.194
He was in the room by himself.

40:38.195 --> 40:39.363
What?

40:41.574 --> 40:45.786
Uh, I'll go check the
backyard to see if she's there.

41:06.807 --> 41:09.018
She's not in the backyard.

41:10.060 --> 41:11.227
Is that yours?

41:11.228 --> 41:12.980
No, it's Maria's.

41:13.981 --> 41:15.149
Um, stay calm.

41:16.025 --> 41:17.651
I will call the police.

41:17.777 --> 41:19.153
Is he okay?

41:19.236 --> 41:20.780
Yeah, he's fine.

41:34.293 --> 41:38.214
Like I said, she's been our
nanny since our son was born.

41:38.255 --> 41:41.258
It's just not like her
to do something like that.

41:41.300 --> 41:44.887
She would never,
ever leave our baby.

41:45.012 --> 41:46.096
Okay Mr. and Mrs. Dunn.

41:46.222 --> 41:47.264
Well, I think we have

41:47.389 --> 41:48.867
all the information
that we need tonight.

41:48.891 --> 41:50.935
If anything comes up,
we'll give you a call.

41:51.060 --> 41:54.021
In the meantime, if you
find out anything, call us.

41:54.146 --> 41:55.146
Okay?

41:55.940 --> 41:56.774
Thanks.

41:56.899 --> 41:57.525
Thank you.

41:57.650 --> 41:58.650
Goodnight.

41:58.692 --> 42:00.486
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

42:09.245 --> 42:12.122
I think you should
go to your mom's.

42:13.165 --> 42:14.208
Why?

42:18.462 --> 42:22.299
Because you don't need
any more distractions.

42:23.926 --> 42:24.945
You've already
been through a lot

42:24.969 --> 42:26.595
since Neron was born.

42:29.723 --> 42:33.936
So you think that I should
go and see my mom or a shrink?

42:35.771 --> 42:37.051
Look, you're the one that said

42:37.106 --> 42:38.625
that you mom was going
through some serious menopause

42:38.649 --> 42:40.985
'cause she hasn't seen Neron.

42:41.110 --> 42:43.279
But seriously, you
should go down there.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.321
Clear your mind.

42:45.322 --> 42:47.950
I'll take car of things here.

42:49.869 --> 42:50.869
Okay.

42:53.080 --> 42:56.041
I can't keep avoiding taking
Neron to see her forever.

42:56.166 --> 42:58.002
No.

42:58.127 --> 43:01.005
Anl I know it sucks having
a psychiatrist for a mom.

43:01.130 --> 43:02.506
Yeah, it sucks.

43:04.341 --> 43:06.844
Will you make me feel better?

43:06.969 --> 43:07.969
Thank you.

43:17.396 --> 43:19.189
Three people
missing in a week.

43:19.315 --> 43:20.357
Any thoughts?

43:22.568 --> 43:23.568
Concepts.

43:24.361 --> 43:25.361
Hunches.

43:26.113 --> 43:27.823
Good ideas, bad ideas.

43:27.948 --> 43:29.116
Messages from space.

43:29.241 --> 43:31.660
From a Ouija board, anything?

43:34.371 --> 43:35.390
Couple said they found that

43:35.414 --> 43:37.374
when they came
home from the show.

43:37.499 --> 43:40.628
Suppose we say it
belongs to the nanny.

43:40.753 --> 43:43.213
No signs of a struggle.

43:43.339 --> 43:47.217
Hmm, I mean three people
vanish without a trace.

43:48.177 --> 43:49.177
No evidence.

43:50.387 --> 43:51.972
Now what is that?

43:53.557 --> 43:54.837
All we know is the nurse's house

43:54.934 --> 43:56.852
was demolished by
who knows what.

43:56.977 --> 43:59.188
That was probably a car.

44:01.398 --> 44:03.484
Probably a car?

44:03.609 --> 44:05.110
I mean if we don't get a grip,

44:05.235 --> 44:06.504
the FBI's gonna
be all over this.

44:06.528 --> 44:08.906
And what's it gonna
make us look like?

44:09.031 --> 44:10.282
Fucking idiots?

44:10.407 --> 44:11.801
I don't need a sentence
completion service.

44:11.825 --> 44:13.827
My ex-wife was a sentence
completion service.

44:13.953 --> 44:17.247
All I need is a little
help here folks.

44:19.583 --> 44:22.419
I think we should start
at the hospital sir.

44:22.461 --> 44:24.546
It's our best connection.

44:26.215 --> 44:27.215
Alright.

44:29.218 --> 44:31.427
And keep an eye on the couple.

44:31.428 --> 44:33.055
You're still here.

44:34.431 --> 44:36.475
Oh.

44:36.600 --> 44:37.934
You can't catch worth a shit.

44:37.976 --> 44:39.043
Take that behind.

45:03.836 --> 45:07.463
Okay I think you need
something to calm you down.

45:07.464 --> 45:08.966
Like sertraline.

45:10.467 --> 45:11.552
Sertraline?

45:11.677 --> 45:12.970
Yep.

45:13.095 --> 45:16.056
It's a neuro pill,
very small closes.

45:17.266 --> 45:19.977
Take one daily
with lots of water.

45:21.353 --> 45:25.274
I'm also going to give you
something to help you sleep.

45:26.483 --> 45:28.318
Be careful with it.

45:29.319 --> 45:32.156
And please, don't drive
when you take them.

45:32.281 --> 45:35.075
Okay, are there
any side effects?

45:38.495 --> 45:41.248
Probably drowsiness,
sleepiness.

45:47.504 --> 45:50.924
Sometimes blurred
vision, hallucinations.

45:53.969 --> 45:56.346
Great, now I'm gonna
feel like a druggie.

45:59.516 --> 46:00.851
Okay, thanks Doc.

46:34.551 --> 46:35.761
Mom.

46:39.014 --> 46:40.014
Mom?

46:56.198 --> 46:57.198
Mom?

47:36.196 --> 47:39.366
Just give me a
minute sweetie, huh?

47:39.491 --> 47:40.367
Sure.

47:40.492 --> 47:41.326
Excuse me.

47:41.451 --> 47:42.451
Sorry.

47:47.583 --> 47:50.626
I love the color
of the office Mom.

47:50.627 --> 47:51.920
Now that color's
supposed to be

47:52.045 --> 47:53.881
very soothing for my patients.

47:54.006 --> 47:57.134
Yeah, it's quite
something.

47:57.259 --> 47:58.259
Oh God.

47:58.969 --> 48:00.637
Neron is so precious.

48:04.183 --> 48:06.894
He's this big handsome boy now.

48:07.019 --> 48:08.019
Yeah.

48:09.229 --> 48:11.481
Can't believe you got
him to sleep so fast.

48:11.607 --> 48:13.442
Uh huh, grandmothers.

48:16.528 --> 48:20.324
We've got the touch.

48:20.449 --> 48:21.449
Oh.

48:22.826 --> 48:24.661
So, talk to me sweetie.

48:27.623 --> 48:30.584
Kevin tells me you've been
really stressed out lately

48:30.667 --> 48:31.960
and hallucinating.

48:32.085 --> 48:33.587
What?

48:33.670 --> 48:35.505
Why would he tell you that?

48:35.631 --> 48:36.298
'Cause
he cares about you.

48:36.423 --> 48:39.384
No, that his wife is crazy?

48:39.509 --> 48:42.679
I can't believe
he would do that.

48:42.804 --> 48:43.804
God.

48:47.351 --> 48:48.351
You know,

48:51.438 --> 48:55.651
it took me a while to
believe your father was dead.

48:56.860 --> 48:58.820
For so long I was
just mad at him

48:58.946 --> 49:00.822
for taking his own life.

49:02.699 --> 49:06.495
Because I wanted it to
be me instead of him.

49:09.706 --> 49:14.378
There was nothing I thought
your father couldn't do.

49:14.503 --> 49:18.674
Ah, he was the perfect
husband, father, friend.

49:22.678 --> 49:26.723
There was no comparison to
his work as a psychiatrist.

49:29.476 --> 49:31.520
His patients all loved him.

49:33.313 --> 49:36.275
And as he continued
to free them all

49:37.776 --> 49:39.903
from their mental health,

49:42.531 --> 49:44.866
their health slowly became his.

49:48.745 --> 49:51.540
You can't blame yourself mom.

49:52.749 --> 49:56.003
It was my responsibility
to give him strength

49:56.128 --> 49:57.546
when he needed it.

49:58.755 --> 49:59.756
I failed him.

50:03.510 --> 50:07.472
That's why I commend
Kevin for doing for you

50:07.597 --> 50:10.766
what I couldn't do
for your father.

50:10.767 --> 50:13.150
Maybe, I've been too hard on him.

50:14.646 --> 50:17.941
Maybe I'm... scared

50:18.775 --> 50:24.098
that Neron is gonna face
the same... loss that I did.

50:26.533 --> 50:30.495
And you just wanna
smother him.

50:30.620 --> 50:31.620
Oh honey.

50:33.248 --> 50:34.750
You always will.

50:38.837 --> 50:40.797
You know what I think?

50:41.965 --> 50:44.926
I think you should
go out on the town

50:46.261 --> 50:47.803
and lick your wounds.

50:47.804 --> 50:50.806
No really, don't
worry about Neron.

50:50.807 --> 50:53.310
I will take care of him
and he'll be just fine.

50:53.435 --> 50:56.396
This isn't the
psychiatrist talking.

50:57.814 --> 50:58.815
This is mom.

51:01.693 --> 51:02.693
Come here.

51:03.820 --> 51:04.820
Thank you.

51:06.031 --> 51:06.823
I love you.

51:06.948 --> 51:09.659
Oh honey I love you too.

51:09.785 --> 51:10.785
I do.

51:34.476 --> 51:35.476
Hey you.

51:38.480 --> 51:41.817
I've missed you these
past couple days.

51:42.859 --> 51:45.904
There's
been a lot going on.

51:46.029 --> 51:48.532
Our nanny's missing and

51:48.657 --> 51:51.576
cops can't find her anywhere.

51:51.701 --> 51:53.286
What, are you serious?

51:53.412 --> 51:54.788
Yeah.

51:55.997 --> 51:59.292
Maybe she just went back
to Mexico or something.

51:59.418 --> 52:00.418
Maybe.

52:00.919 --> 52:03.380
I hope that's what it is.

52:03.505 --> 52:05.881
What else would it be?

52:05.882 --> 52:09.302
I don't know.

52:13.223 --> 52:15.851
You seemed really stressed.

52:20.897 --> 52:22.899
I could take care of you.

52:30.907 --> 52:31.907
Tara.

52:32.784 --> 52:34.786
When Ali gets back, we,

52:34.911 --> 52:37.831
we can't see each
other like this.

52:37.914 --> 52:38.999
I don't like to be alone.

52:39.124 --> 52:41.960
I like it better
when you're there.

52:42.085 --> 52:43.795
Ali's going through
a lot right now.

52:43.920 --> 52:45.922
I can't just pick up and go.

52:47.048 --> 52:49.050
Just give me a couple days.

52:49.176 --> 52:50.176
Okay?

52:55.891 --> 52:57.279
I could just stay
with you at your house

52:57.280 --> 52:58.852
until she gets home.

53:01.104 --> 53:04.940
She'd call you before
she gets home, right?

53:04.941 --> 53:06.693
Yeah, she has to.

53:07.819 --> 53:09.338
She doesn't wanna come
home to an empty house.

53:09.362 --> 53:12.991
She said she's
definitely gonna call.

53:13.116 --> 53:16.870
Come here.

54:40.912 --> 54:42.037
Who are you?

54:42.038 --> 54:43.540
And what are you
doing in my house?

54:43.665 --> 54:45.792
He was on the floor.

54:45.917 --> 54:48.962
Not a good place
for a young baby.

54:50.005 --> 54:52.674
I'm
calling the police.

54:52.799 --> 54:53.799
I have an appointment.

54:53.842 --> 54:55.677
Allison scheduled it for me.

54:55.802 --> 54:59.681
My daughter doesn't
schedule my appointments.

55:05.061 --> 55:07.647
Some night on the town Mom.

55:15.071 --> 55:16.071
Oh yeah.

55:17.532 --> 55:19.075
Oh, let me take him.

55:20.076 --> 55:21.161
I'll be back.

55:25.123 --> 55:27.083
I need to put the baby to bed.

55:30.086 --> 55:32.922
I will take one
Gonilla sandwich please.

55:33.048 --> 55:34.048
Thank you.

55:35.925 --> 55:37.052
That'll be $1.

55:37.093 --> 55:38.093
Thank you.

55:50.106 --> 55:51.816
I have to take out.

55:54.110 --> 55:55.987
It's okay sweetheart.

55:56.112 --> 55:56.738
Shh, shh, shh.

55:56.863 --> 55:57.714
It's okay.

55:57.756 --> 56:01.817
No! There's something
that I must show you.

56:03.119 --> 56:06.748
Have you look in
his eyes lately?

56:06.873 --> 56:08.083
I don't know what you mean.

56:08.124 --> 56:10.835
There's so much to see.

56:12.128 --> 56:13.922
Yes, look at this eyes.

56:19.719 --> 56:21.054
Wait.

56:21.137 --> 56:23.098
Wait right here.

56:23.139 --> 56:24.224
I have to put him to bed.

56:24.349 --> 56:26.142
Wait, I'll be right back.

56:26.267 --> 56:27.267
Wait.

56:54.337 --> 56:56.923
I need to speak to you Helen.

56:58.550 --> 57:00.385
Do you ever think of me?

57:07.934 --> 57:11.187
Do you know what it's
like to rot in hell here?

57:11.312 --> 57:12.312
Hrnm?

57:16.234 --> 57:17.234
Hmm.

57:22.198 --> 57:24.826
Do you know what you did to me?

57:27.245 --> 57:28.621
What?

57:31.207 --> 57:32.518
Do you know what it's
like to feel here,

57:32.542 --> 57:34.335
you rot in hell.

57:34.461 --> 57:38.506
Oh my God, Jim.

57:38.631 --> 57:39.883
No.

57:40.008 --> 57:42.552
Well now you're
gonna feel like me.

57:42.677 --> 57:45.221
Look at me.

57:46.389 --> 57:48.016
And now you will.

57:57.233 --> 57:58.233
Shit.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.240
You will.

58:10.371 --> 58:12.457
Just give him to me.

58:12.582 --> 58:13.582
Oh no, no.

58:17.253 --> 58:18.379
Please.

58:32.268 --> 58:33.268
God.

58:34.270 --> 58:35.270
God.

58:35.855 --> 58:36.855
No!

58:40.026 --> 58:41.026
Mom?

58:42.695 --> 58:43.695
Mom!

58:44.280 --> 58:45.280
Mom!

58:48.409 --> 58:49.409
Mom.

58:50.286 --> 58:51.538
Mom.

58:51.663 --> 58:52.956
Mom!

59:25.363 --> 59:27.782
We got a call
about a homicide.

59:27.907 --> 59:28.907
Yes, yes.

59:30.118 --> 59:31.202
Are you okay?

59:31.327 --> 59:32.327
What happened?

59:35.331 --> 59:37.000
Someone shot my mom.

59:37.125 --> 59:38.543
Someone shot my mom.

59:40.086 --> 59:42.213
Did you get a
description of the person?

59:42.338 --> 59:45.091
No, I just walked
in and found her.

59:46.092 --> 59:48.094
Where's the body?

59:48.219 --> 59:49.846
Upstairs in the office room.

59:49.971 --> 59:51.347
Go check it out.

59:59.230 --> 01:00:01.316
Do you have any idea
who could've done this?

01:00:01.357 --> 01:00:03.318
How the hell would I know that!

01:00:03.359 --> 01:00:04.359
Ma'am.

01:00:07.113 --> 01:00:10.366
I'm gonna need you
to stay here ma'am.

01:00:22.629 --> 01:00:24.756
Step inside please ma'am.

01:00:26.174 --> 01:00:28.009
I'll take the baby ma'am.

01:00:28.134 --> 01:00:29.384
Let me have the baby.

01:00:29.385 --> 01:00:30.385
It's okay.

01:00:33.222 --> 01:00:35.183
Follow the lieutenant.

01:00:44.859 --> 01:00:46.402
Step inside ma'am.

01:00:52.408 --> 01:00:54.702
She was right here.

01:00:54.827 --> 01:00:55.703
She was right here.

01:00:55.828 --> 01:00:57.038
She was.

01:00:57.163 --> 01:00:58.163
She was dead.

01:00:58.247 --> 01:00:59.414
- She...
- Listen ma'am.

01:00:59.415 --> 01:01:01.084
There is no dead body.

01:01:01.209 --> 01:01:04.253
There's not even
evidence of a dead body.

01:01:04.379 --> 01:01:06.756
If you're feeling
stressed, go see a shrink.

01:01:06.881 --> 01:01:08.400
Or next time we are
going to arrest you

01:01:08.424 --> 01:01:11.426
for filing a false
police report.

01:01:11.427 --> 01:01:13.262
Are you on medication?

01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:17.433
Yeah but, I'm not crazy.

01:01:18.768 --> 01:01:19.852
We've got a 1282.

01:01:19.978 --> 01:01:20.728
Let's get outta here.

01:01:20.853 --> 01:01:22.355
I'm not crazy.

01:01:24.232 --> 01:01:25.441
I'm not crazy!

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.600
Hey babe, is that you?

01:02:01.144 --> 01:02:02.353
Hey.

01:02:02.478 --> 01:02:03.478
What's wrong baby,
what happened?

01:02:03.479 --> 01:02:05.815
Why are you back home so early?

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.983
Oh what's wrong?

01:02:07.108 --> 01:02:08.151
My mom.

01:02:08.276 --> 01:02:10.361
My mom, she's dead.

01:02:10.486 --> 01:02:11.630
She's...
What are you talking about?

01:02:11.654 --> 01:02:13.906
Kevin, I need
you to believe me.

01:02:14.032 --> 01:02:14.999
Why wouldn't I believe you?

01:02:15.024 --> 01:02:16.464
Okay, I walked
into my mom's office.

01:02:16.492 --> 01:02:17.785
And I saw her dead.

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:19.787
It looked like
somebody had shot her.

01:02:19.912 --> 01:02:22.206
Okay, but when I
called the police,

01:02:22.331 --> 01:02:23.498
her body was missing.

01:02:23.499 --> 01:02:25.209
Okay, whoa, slow down.

01:02:25.334 --> 01:02:26.169
Her body was missing.

01:02:26.294 --> 01:02:27.420
- Missing?
- Yes.

01:02:27.503 --> 01:02:28.605
Okay baby, that
doesn't make any sense.

01:02:28.629 --> 01:02:30.381
I know.

01:02:30.506 --> 01:02:31.525
Maybe you were hallucinating.

01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:33.176
No.

01:02:33.301 --> 01:02:36.804
No, I wasn't fucking
hallucinating, Kevin.

01:02:36.929 --> 01:02:38.222
Okay?

01:02:38.347 --> 01:02:41.184
I saw my mom dead in her office.

01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:42.351
I saw it.

01:02:42.477 --> 01:02:43.518
And it was real.

01:02:43.519 --> 01:02:45.146
Okay, I'm not saying
you didn't see it.

01:02:45.271 --> 01:02:47.190
Okay, maybe someone moved her.

01:02:47.315 --> 01:02:48.315
No.

01:02:49.525 --> 01:02:50.525
No.

01:02:51.527 --> 01:02:52.527
Hey, hey.

01:02:53.529 --> 01:02:54.572
Everything will be fine.

01:02:54.697 --> 01:02:56.157
I promise.

01:02:56.282 --> 01:02:58.534
Okay, we'll figure this out.

01:03:00.536 --> 01:03:03.623
Look, you gotta get some rest.

01:03:03.748 --> 01:03:04.957
Get some rest.

01:03:06.084 --> 01:03:07.210
For me.

01:03:07.335 --> 01:03:08.335
Okay.

01:03:37.573 --> 01:03:38.573
Oh God.

01:03:48.459 --> 01:03:49.459
Men.

01:04:11.232 --> 01:04:12.232
Hey babe.

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:17.321
I can explain.

01:04:18.614 --> 01:04:20.324
In our bedroom Kevin.

01:04:20.449 --> 01:04:23.286
What are
you talking about?

01:04:23.411 --> 01:04:25.538
In our bedroom Kevin?

01:04:27.832 --> 01:04:29.041
Did you do it?

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:33.754
Ali, you've, you've
been so different and...

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.298
Well yeah, yeah.

01:04:35.423 --> 01:04:37.133
I'm boring and bitchy.

01:04:38.467 --> 01:04:41.345
What, so you go and fuck
my best friend, is that it?

01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:42.573
- Hey babe, babe, babe.
- No, no!

01:04:42.597 --> 01:04:45.641
Don't, don't, don't
even touch me.

01:04:45.741 --> 01:04:46.976
Ali!

01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:48.644
You're sick.

01:04:48.686 --> 01:04:50.933
And you're a pathetic
unfaithful bastard.

01:04:50.968 --> 01:04:52.732
I don't want ever to see your face again.

01:04:52.857 --> 01:04:54.525
I don't wanna live
with you anymore.

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:55.943
Get out!

01:04:56.068 --> 01:04:57.278
Get out!

01:04:57.403 --> 01:04:59.530
You're fucking
crazy and paranoid.

01:04:59.655 --> 01:05:00.406
You know what, I'm
gonna leave now,

01:05:00.531 --> 01:05:02.200
but I'm coming back for my son.

01:05:02.325 --> 01:05:04.411
This is not a good
environment for him.

01:05:04.446 --> 01:05:05.161
Go!

01:05:05.286 --> 01:05:07.163
- You need help!
- Now!

01:05:46.744 --> 01:05:49.580
Father I've, I've come to you

01:05:49.705 --> 01:05:53.376
because I don't know
what else to do.

01:05:53.501 --> 01:05:57.630
I... I don't know why
he's so restless.

01:06:01.717 --> 01:06:04.470
I know why you're here.

01:06:04.595 --> 01:06:06.722
Your problem is not with you.

01:06:08.683 --> 01:06:09.892
It's your child.

01:06:13.688 --> 01:06:14.438
Father?

01:06:14.563 --> 01:06:16.565
No harm will come to your son.

01:06:16.691 --> 01:06:20.027
The sister will take him
outside and watch over him.

01:06:20.152 --> 01:06:21.152
It's okay.

01:06:23.572 --> 01:06:24.740
Thank you sister.

01:06:28.411 --> 01:06:31.872
You are surrounded
by a terrible evil,

01:06:31.998 --> 01:06:35.251
an evil that'll keep
a cloak over you.

01:06:36.544 --> 01:06:39.463
It will smother you
if you take no action.

01:06:40.715 --> 01:06:42.174
See to your child.

01:06:46.595 --> 01:06:47.595
I don't understand.

01:06:47.638 --> 01:06:49.098
See to your child.

01:06:51.559 --> 01:06:53.185
What do you mean?

01:07:14.123 --> 01:07:16.792
Let's get this show over with.

01:07:18.169 --> 01:07:19.794
Just calm down.

01:07:19.795 --> 01:07:20.795
Alright.

01:07:21.547 --> 01:07:22.798
Don't even try.

01:07:30.806 --> 01:07:32.641
Hi, I'm Detective Corrigan.

01:07:32.767 --> 01:07:33.785
I've believe you've
met my associates,

01:07:33.809 --> 01:07:36.896
Detectives Kerr,
Detective Ferry.

01:07:37.021 --> 01:07:39.231
Is this about my mom?

01:07:39.357 --> 01:07:40.691
You found her.

01:07:40.816 --> 01:07:44.820
Ma'am, you mind
if we come inside and talk?

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.338
What, so you found my mom?

01:08:02.463 --> 01:08:03.672
Nothing yet.

01:08:05.049 --> 01:08:06.592
But the forensics team

01:08:06.717 --> 01:08:09.678
did find evidence
of a blood splatter.

01:08:09.804 --> 01:08:10.804
Sorry.

01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:14.409
And there's also the
matter of the disappearance

01:08:14.433 --> 01:08:16.769
of a doctor and a nurse.

01:08:16.852 --> 01:08:18.853
I'm pretty sure you
know who they are.

01:08:18.854 --> 01:08:22.524
The ones that tended to
you during your labor.

01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:24.484
Doctor Jones is missing?

01:08:24.609 --> 01:08:25.611
Yeah.

01:08:27.113 --> 01:08:30.323
Any idea about
their whereabouts?

01:08:30.448 --> 01:08:31.448
No.

01:08:32.326 --> 01:08:33.326
No.

01:08:35.121 --> 01:08:36.121
Why would I?

01:08:41.752 --> 01:08:43.379
I'm sorry, I'm sorry officers,

01:08:43.504 --> 01:08:45.840
I have to take that.
Wait.

01:08:46.841 --> 01:08:47.841
Wait a minute.

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:50.594
Okay.

01:08:50.719 --> 01:08:52.513
What the hell was that?

01:08:52.638 --> 01:08:53.639
Hey you.

01:08:54.765 --> 01:08:56.642
How are you today buddy?

01:08:56.767 --> 01:08:59.728
What do you guys make of her?

01:08:59.854 --> 01:09:01.622
She definitely knows
more than she's telling us.

01:09:01.647 --> 01:09:03.649
I don't know about that.

01:09:03.774 --> 01:09:05.024
Hi.

01:09:05.151 --> 01:09:06.402
Hi.

01:09:06.527 --> 01:09:07.629
What the
hell is that smell?

01:09:07.653 --> 01:09:08.779
Damn.

01:09:08.904 --> 01:09:09.779
You smelled it first.

01:09:09.904 --> 01:09:10.904
No, oh, no.

01:09:10.906 --> 01:09:12.616
Chief, it's not my job.

01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:15.161
I'm not, I don't
do, I don't do that.

01:09:15.286 --> 01:09:16.846
But could we just
wait 'til she gets back?

01:09:16.871 --> 01:09:20.374
Oh my gosh, you
guys are such babies.

01:09:20.499 --> 01:09:21.917
Hi handsome.

01:09:21.959 --> 01:09:24.170
Oh you're so adorable.

01:09:24.295 --> 01:09:26.671
Do you want me to change
your diaper for you?

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:27.921
Do you want me to do that?

01:09:27.923 --> 01:09:28.923
Yes, I do.

01:09:28.924 --> 01:09:29.925
Awful! Okay.

01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:33.554
I'm sure your mommy
won't mind that dirty job

01:09:33.679 --> 01:09:36.348
being take care of, huh buddy.

01:09:36.474 --> 01:09:38.809
Okay, I'll be right
back you big babies.

01:09:38.934 --> 01:09:40.435
Didn't you?

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.645
Come back here.

01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:43.564
Huh?

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:45.232
How did you get to be so cute.

01:09:45.357 --> 01:09:47.359
Huh, how did that happen?

01:10:12.843 --> 01:10:13.843
Are you okay?

01:10:15.971 --> 01:10:18.182
Ahhh!

01:11:00.766 --> 01:11:01.934
How many have died?

01:11:02.017 --> 01:11:04.436
Or have gone missing?

01:11:04.562 --> 01:11:06.772
Five, maybe five Father.

01:11:10.359 --> 01:11:12.653
He will be a mortal soon.

01:11:14.238 --> 01:11:16.282
Once he is a mortal,
his only agenda will be

01:11:16.407 --> 01:11:19.034
to rule this Earth
for a dark millennium.

01:11:19.159 --> 01:11:23.706
And he will use all the power
of satan to do it, believe me.

01:11:23.831 --> 01:11:24.831
My son?

01:11:25.791 --> 01:11:27.751
You must put that
outta your mind.

01:11:27.876 --> 01:11:29.211
He is not your son.

01:11:30.588 --> 01:11:34.133
He has come to bring
forth hell on Earth.

01:11:34.258 --> 01:11:35.843
Who's his father?

01:11:37.052 --> 01:11:39.597
Why does that matter?

01:11:39.722 --> 01:11:40.722
I...

01:11:42.057 --> 01:11:43.809
Who is he?

01:11:43.934 --> 01:11:44.935
I can't do this.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.729
It's making me crazy.

01:11:46.854 --> 01:11:51.066
You knew he was different
from the time he was born.

01:11:53.277 --> 01:11:54.462
You know what I
say is the truth,

01:11:54.486 --> 01:11:56.822
you've seen it in your dreams.

01:11:56.947 --> 01:11:58.699
Who are you?

01:11:58.824 --> 01:12:00.784
I'm like you.

01:12:00.909 --> 01:12:02.995
But I've been given
a terrible task.

01:12:03.078 --> 01:12:06.957
I dwell in the void
between the terrestrial

01:12:07.082 --> 01:12:08.334
and the celestial realms.

01:12:08.459 --> 01:12:12.755
I oversee the balance
between good and evil.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.050
But now evil has
twisted the scale.

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:20.721
Are you an angel?

01:12:20.846 --> 01:12:21.846
Oh no, no.

01:12:23.932 --> 01:12:25.434
I am not an angel.

01:12:25.559 --> 01:12:29.104
I'm a mortal like you
with a mortal's heart.

01:12:31.106 --> 01:12:35.110
You must be willing to
accept the unacceptable.

01:12:35.152 --> 01:12:37.071
He is not your son.

01:12:39.114 --> 01:12:41.825
What you see is only a vessel

01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:45.245
to something dark
and beyond evil.

01:12:45.371 --> 01:12:47.122
Now, who's his father?

01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:52.753
Kevin, my husband.

01:12:54.254 --> 01:12:56.131
We don't live together anymore.

01:12:56.256 --> 01:12:57.466
Where is he?

01:12:57.591 --> 01:13:00.135
He's with another woman.

01:13:00.177 --> 01:13:02.137
She was my best friend.

01:13:04.014 --> 01:13:05.014
Listen,

01:13:08.143 --> 01:13:11.563
he is a conduit for
supernatural forces.

01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:14.274
He is capable of
producing even more evil.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.984
He must be stopped.

01:13:18.946 --> 01:13:20.572
It must be stopped.

01:15:10.265 --> 01:15:11.934
What do you want Kevin?

01:15:12.059 --> 01:15:13.143
Where are you?

01:15:13.268 --> 01:15:14.353
I wanna talk to you.

01:15:14.478 --> 01:15:15.604
We are talking.

01:15:15.729 --> 01:15:17.231
In person.

01:15:17.272 --> 01:15:19.273
No, I don't
wanna see you.

01:15:19.274 --> 01:15:22.110
<i>You know there's a lot
of people looking for you?</i>

01:15:22.236 --> 01:15:24.822
But I haven't done anything.

01:15:24.947 --> 01:15:27.199
Kevin do you even
realize what's going on,

01:15:27.282 --> 01:15:30.118
how many lives are at
stake because of you.

01:15:30.244 --> 01:15:31.829
What are
you talking about?

01:15:31.954 --> 01:15:34.164
I've come to know
a lot about you recently.

01:15:34.289 --> 01:15:35.123
Too much.

01:15:35.249 --> 01:15:37.417
Where's my son?

01:15:37.543 --> 01:15:39.044
He's here.

01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:40.169
Where are you?

01:15:40.254 --> 01:15:41.338
I wanna come get him.

01:15:41.463 --> 01:15:43.924
No, you're not taking him.

01:15:45.175 --> 01:15:47.469
Fine, I at least
wanna see him.

01:16:16.164 --> 01:16:17.332
Can I come in?

01:16:23.297 --> 01:16:24.297
Hey.

01:16:24.923 --> 01:16:26.091
Hey.

01:16:26.216 --> 01:16:29.469
Get over here my
little linebacker.

01:16:29.595 --> 01:16:30.595
Hi.

01:16:31.555 --> 01:16:33.223
Hi.

01:16:33.348 --> 01:16:34.348
I missed you.

01:16:39.605 --> 01:16:40.856
How you doing?

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:48.363
We need to
talk about our son.

01:16:53.368 --> 01:16:54.703
That's why I'm here.

01:16:54.828 --> 01:16:56.038
Let's work this out.

01:16:56.163 --> 01:16:59.666
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

01:16:59.791 --> 01:17:01.919
When did you go to Mexico?

01:17:04.338 --> 01:17:07.382
Sit down.

01:17:13.555 --> 01:17:14.555
Hey buddy.

01:17:18.936 --> 01:17:20.394
Mexico?

01:17:20.395 --> 01:17:21.395
Really?

01:17:23.231 --> 01:17:24.231
I don't know.

01:17:24.274 --> 01:17:25.067
I don't remember.

01:17:25.192 --> 01:17:26.068
What difference does it make?

01:17:26.193 --> 01:17:29.404
What does that have
to do with this?

01:17:29.446 --> 01:17:34.284
You went to see some
black magic guy in Mexico.

01:17:34.409 --> 01:17:38.330
And now so much is happening
you can't even imagine.

01:17:42.167 --> 01:17:45.420
I'm thirsty, I'm
gonna get some water.

01:17:46.964 --> 01:17:50.050
Something happened in Mexico.

01:17:50.175 --> 01:17:53.428
Whatever happened is
affecting our son!

01:18:11.697 --> 01:18:14.533
I know, motel
water's disgusting.

01:18:15.784 --> 01:18:17.869
You want me to get
you a bottle of water?

01:18:17.995 --> 01:18:18.995
No.

01:18:23.291 --> 01:18:27.087
Ali, do you have any
idea how crazy you sound?

01:18:27.212 --> 01:18:29.172
People are dead Kevin.

01:18:30.465 --> 01:18:31.800
You need help.

01:18:33.093 --> 01:18:36.096
You're not well, you
haven't been well.

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.140
Ali!

01:18:41.518 --> 01:18:42.518
Ali, hey.

01:18:45.272 --> 01:18:46.481
Hey, hey, hey.

01:18:54.489 --> 01:18:55.741
Let's go buddy.

01:18:55.866 --> 01:18:57.325
It's time to go.

01:19:56.384 --> 01:19:57.384
Om.

01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:02.974
You've meddled in the
affairs of the future.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:07.395
Time is tilted, but not
in your favor Priest.

01:20:07.521 --> 01:20:10.398
Like a bad clock,
you must be reset.

01:20:10.524 --> 01:20:11.983
We have always existed.

01:20:12.109 --> 01:20:13.568
I am their guardian.

01:20:15.153 --> 01:20:17.739
You're the
guardian of nothing.

01:20:32.796 --> 01:20:37.008
Yeah, she's staying at a
motel at the end of I-21.

01:20:38.051 --> 01:20:39.594
Yeah, she's alone.

01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:44.266
Thank you.

01:20:44.391 --> 01:20:45.391
Bye.

01:20:54.609 --> 01:20:56.319
Who was that?

01:20:56.444 --> 01:21:01.241
That was Doctor Jones, our
doctor who delivered Neron.

01:21:01.366 --> 01:21:02.617
What did he want?

01:21:04.619 --> 01:21:06.830
He wanted to know
where Allison was.

01:21:06.955 --> 01:21:08.290
He thinks he can help her out.

01:21:08.415 --> 01:21:11.626
How did he know you
knew where she was?

01:21:14.045 --> 01:21:15.422
I don't know.

01:21:19.634 --> 01:21:21.094
There's
not much time.

01:21:21.219 --> 01:21:22.929
You must end this now.

01:21:24.681 --> 01:21:27.641
This dagger is
from the holy land.

01:21:27.642 --> 01:21:30.644
It was given to me
by the one before me.

01:21:30.645 --> 01:21:32.480
And to him by the
one before him.

01:21:32.606 --> 01:21:36.484
So, it is made from the
silver of the holy challis.

01:21:38.486 --> 01:21:40.572
It'll protect you from evil.

01:22:08.433 --> 01:22:09.433
Who is it?

01:22:16.316 --> 01:22:17.316
Stop!

01:22:22.322 --> 01:22:23.698
We come for you.

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:26.117
In a moment everything'll
be in its place.

01:22:26.243 --> 01:22:27.994
You should be very proud.

01:22:28.119 --> 01:22:30.664
Your son will have
dominion over all.

01:22:36.670 --> 01:22:37.670
Kevin, run!

01:22:38.713 --> 01:22:39.713
Allison.

01:22:40.674 --> 01:22:42.717
What do you see baby boy?

01:22:48.682 --> 01:22:51.351
In your dream, nobody's
messing with you.

01:22:51.476 --> 01:22:53.520
Allison, what's going on?

01:22:55.897 --> 01:22:56.897
Hello?

01:22:58.566 --> 01:22:59.566
Allison?

01:23:00.277 --> 01:23:01.277
Allison!

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:07.742
Tara, what are you doing?

01:23:08.743 --> 01:23:09.743
Tara?

01:23:11.496 --> 01:23:12.496
Tara no!

01:23:42.902 --> 01:23:44.362
Get off.

01:23:47.907 --> 01:23:48.907
Stop!

01:23:52.912 --> 01:23:53.912
Fuck.

01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:02.714
Yes, we have her.

01:24:20.815 --> 01:24:21.566
Kevin!

01:24:21.691 --> 01:24:22.691
I saw what happened.

01:24:22.776 --> 01:24:23.776
Get in.

01:24:38.875 --> 01:24:39.875
Tara's dead.

01:24:42.170 --> 01:24:43.170
How?

01:24:45.256 --> 01:24:46.591
I took a phone call.

01:24:46.716 --> 01:24:49.719
I thought it was you, then
there was nobody there.

01:24:49.844 --> 01:24:54.599
Then I looked over; And Tara
was standing at the window.

01:24:54.724 --> 01:24:57.727
Craziest eyes I've ever seen.

01:24:57.852 --> 01:25:01.648
She was holding onto Neron
and then she just fell out.

01:25:02.857 --> 01:25:03.857
Neron?

01:25:05.276 --> 01:25:07.278
He didn't have
a scratch on him.

01:25:07.404 --> 01:25:08.071
Where is he?

01:25:08.196 --> 01:25:09.322
I don't know.

01:25:09.447 --> 01:25:10.740
He just disappeared.

01:25:10.865 --> 01:25:14.494
He was gone, I couldn't
even find him anywhere.

01:25:14.619 --> 01:25:15.619
This is crazy.

01:25:15.662 --> 01:25:16.955
Yeah, it's crazy.

01:25:21.876 --> 01:25:22.876
Mom.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:26.880
MQrn?

01:25:28.842 --> 01:25:29.842
Mom.

01:25:31.302 --> 01:25:32.512
Look, hold on.

01:25:33.888 --> 01:25:34.889
Where are you?

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:37.892
Okay.

01:25:37.934 --> 01:25:38.934
Mom.

01:25:40.687 --> 01:25:41.729
What, what did she say?

01:25:41.855 --> 01:25:43.897
She's alive but she's hurt.

01:25:43.898 --> 01:25:46.985
She has Neron and
she's at the house.

01:25:48.903 --> 01:25:50.738
Okay, we're five minutes away.

01:25:57.871 --> 01:25:58.872
Sir?

01:26:00.707 --> 01:26:02.625
I just got a call
from the morgue.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:04.627
Two bodies were stolen.

01:26:05.712 --> 01:26:07.380
What bodies?

01:26:07.505 --> 01:26:09.174
One was just some
Jane Doe hooker.

01:26:09.299 --> 01:26:11.801
But the other was
Detective Ferry.

01:26:11.926 --> 01:26:13.553
Someone stole
Detective Ferry's body?

01:26:13.678 --> 01:26:15.346
What the hell's going on?

01:26:15.472 --> 01:26:16.806
It gets stranger than that.

01:26:16.931 --> 01:26:18.576
One of our units claimed
they seen Detective Ferry

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.810
steal a black a white
from the motor pool.

01:26:20.935 --> 01:26:22.562
They tried to follow her

01:26:22.687 --> 01:26:24.939
but they lost her in traffic.

01:26:27.484 --> 01:26:28.484
Yeah?

01:26:29.944 --> 01:26:31.945
Detective Ferry?

01:26:31.946 --> 01:26:34.282
Yeah! I know that motel.

01:26:34.407 --> 01:26:35.407
Holy shit.

01:26:36.826 --> 01:26:39.579
Get the hell outta
here, let's go.

01:26:41.956 --> 01:26:43.082
Mom!

01:26:48.087 --> 01:26:49.087
Eleanor?

01:26:54.969 --> 01:26:55.969
Eleanor.

01:27:14.739 --> 01:27:15.740
Neron.

01:27:35.009 --> 01:27:36.009
Neron.

01:28:10.295 --> 01:28:11.295
Kevin!

01:28:19.053 --> 01:28:22.849
What is it?

01:28:24.392 --> 01:28:26.728
I think I heard Neron.

01:28:26.853 --> 01:28:28.062
I heard him crying.

01:28:28.187 --> 01:28:29.022
Crying?

01:28:29.063 --> 01:28:30.063
Yeah.

01:29:34.003 --> 01:29:35.463
Allison.

01:29:36.339 --> 01:29:37.339
Mom?

01:29:38.675 --> 01:29:40.343
You're alive?

01:29:40.468 --> 01:29:43.136
Give me the knife sweetheart.

01:29:43.137 --> 01:29:45.682
You don't wanna hurt anybody.

01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.894
You'd better do what she said.

01:29:50.019 --> 01:29:53.022
Mr. Dunn, thank
you for joining us.

01:29:53.147 --> 01:29:55.108
You're the final
piece in the puzzle.

01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:58.778
The world will soon
have a new order.

01:29:58.903 --> 01:30:00.863
Mom, what are you doing?

01:30:00.988 --> 01:30:02.156
Don't be sad.

01:30:03.533 --> 01:30:06.077
Everything is going to be fine.

01:30:07.412 --> 01:30:09.163
She's not your mom.

01:30:12.166 --> 01:30:14.293
Being that you are the key,

01:30:14.419 --> 01:30:17.922
the last piece of the puzzle
and the one that started this,

01:30:18.047 --> 01:30:20.173
I was planning something
a bit more theatrical

01:30:20.174 --> 01:30:21.467
for you and Neron.

01:30:21.592 --> 01:30:23.261
Neron's father
wanted to be here,

01:30:23.386 --> 01:30:26.055
but time's being what they are.

01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.391
No!

01:30:28.516 --> 01:30:29.726
Allison, no.

01:30:29.851 --> 01:30:31.060
Stay back.

01:30:31.185 --> 01:30:32.687
Bring
me the dagger.

01:30:32.812 --> 01:30:35.398
It's time for the
new millennium.

01:31:09.182 --> 01:31:11.976
Fuck you, you
home wrecking cunt.

01:31:17.815 --> 01:31:21.068
Don't do
this sweetheart.

01:31:21.194 --> 01:31:22.236
He's your son.

01:31:23.654 --> 01:31:24.654
I'm mom.

01:31:30.077 --> 01:31:31.454
- Mom.
- Mom.

01:31:31.579 --> 01:31:32.914
Yes.

01:31:33.039 --> 01:31:35.248
We'll go to the park.

01:31:35.249 --> 01:31:38.461
I'll buy you an ice cream cone.

01:31:38.586 --> 01:31:42.089
Don't you remember when
you were a little girl?

01:31:42.215 --> 01:31:46.260
I still have one of the
ribbons from your hair.

01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:05.154
Let's grab the baby.

01:32:05.279 --> 01:32:07.406
Let's get outta here.

01:32:41.107 --> 01:32:42.275
Yeah, yeah.

01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:47.070
Hey.

01:32:48.281 --> 01:32:50.032
We're gonna be okay.

01:32:56.706 --> 01:32:59.333
I'm so sorry. I
love you so much.

01:33:01.961 --> 01:33:03.087
I'm so sorry.

01:33:10.344 --> 01:33:12.138
Neron's gonna be fine.

01:33:13.306 --> 01:33:14.390
Look at me.

01:33:14.515 --> 01:33:15.975
Look at me.

01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:17.911
Look, I know I haven't
earned your trust, okay?

01:33:17.935 --> 01:33:21.772
I know, I know I've done a
lotta bad things in this,

01:33:21.898 --> 01:33:24.357
but trust me when I say this,

01:33:24.358 --> 01:33:26.235
the moll told me, look at me,

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:29.780
he told me if we can
clear him from evil,

01:33:29.906 --> 01:33:32.116
he will be innocent again.

01:33:34.368 --> 01:33:35.703
The moll told me.

01:33:37.246 --> 01:33:38.581
He's gonna be fine.

01:33:40.124 --> 01:33:41.124
Trust me.

01:33:42.209 --> 01:33:43.209
Okay?
