00:01.390 --> 00:03.100
ADULT SHELDON:
Some people are just

00:03.100 --> 00:04.270
natural-born worriers.

00:04.270 --> 00:05.640
My mother, for example,

00:05.640 --> 00:07.440
could whip herself
into a frenzy

00:07.440 --> 00:09.480
even if I were sitting
on my bed doing nothing.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.010
Shelly?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.760
Shelly?

00:19.970 --> 00:21.520
Everything okay?

00:21.520 --> 00:23.190
Hunky-dory. Why?

00:23.190 --> 00:26.770
Well, you're kind of dressed
like you kidnapped yourself.

00:26.770 --> 00:29.360
Oh, I'm trying to block out
sensory input.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.820
I hit a roadblock determining

00:30.820 --> 00:32.990
whether virtual particles
have a fixed mass

00:32.990 --> 00:35.110
or violate
momentum conservation.

00:35.110 --> 00:37.240
But then I remembered
that Nikola Tesla believed

00:37.240 --> 00:40.200
that isolation
is where ideas are born.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.870
Who's Nikola Tesla?

00:41.870 --> 00:45.580
One of the most prolific
scientists of the 20th century.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.330
Okay.

00:47.330 --> 00:48.540
And, um...

00:48.540 --> 00:51.130
just out of curiosity,

00:51.130 --> 00:53.220
how isolated was he?

00:53.220 --> 00:54.430
Oh, highly.

00:54.430 --> 00:57.090
He found human contact
revolting.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.680
(exasperated sigh)

00:58.680 --> 01:01.770
Well, that's kind of a lonely
way to live, don't you think?

01:01.770 --> 01:03.770
Well, he wasn't entirely alone.

01:03.770 --> 01:06.150
At the end of his life,
he became good friends

01:06.150 --> 01:07.730
with a brown pigeon.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.070
Great.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.320
See ya.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.510
Have you heard from Dr. Sturgis
at all?

01:37.510 --> 01:39.140
No.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.760
Can you believe
the hospital's

01:40.760 --> 01:43.020
still holding him
for observation?

01:43.020 --> 01:44.520
Can't you?

01:44.520 --> 01:45.730
Well...

01:45.730 --> 01:47.810
I think I just
felt a neutrino.

01:47.810 --> 01:50.820
That one went
right through my pants.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.270
You have goosegrass.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.570
And you can't have a nice lawn

01:54.570 --> 01:56.110
if you have goosegrass.

01:56.110 --> 01:57.110
(laughing)

01:57.110 --> 01:59.780
I mean, I'm worried about him.

01:59.780 --> 02:02.160
I don't know
how serious this is.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.410
The whole year
you were together...

02:05.410 --> 02:07.540
did you see any, um...

02:07.540 --> 02:09.420
warning signs?

02:09.420 --> 02:11.540
No. Not really.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.800
I just thought he was another...

02:12.800 --> 02:14.050
(chuckles):
you know,

02:14.050 --> 02:17.720
cute, quirky egghead
like Sheldon.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.590
Speaking of which,

02:20.590 --> 02:23.560
when are you gonna tell Sheldon
the truth about John?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.470
Mm. When the time is right.

02:25.470 --> 02:27.850
So he still thinks
he's being treated for mono?

02:27.850 --> 02:29.690
I had to come up
with something contagious

02:29.690 --> 02:31.310
so he wouldn't want to visit.

02:31.310 --> 02:33.070
Smart.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.530
Thank you.

02:34.530 --> 02:35.730
You're good at lying.

02:35.730 --> 02:37.150
You should do it more often.

02:37.990 --> 02:40.320
I like your earrings.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.280
COMMENTATOR:
Oh, my, he's gonna be trapped!

02:43.280 --> 02:45.830
All right, see, when you get
tackled in your own end zone,

02:45.830 --> 02:48.580
the other team gets
two points and the ball.

02:48.580 --> 02:50.000
That's called a safety.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.710
I thought one of the
players was a safety.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.460
Well, that's true, too.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.010
I'm confused.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.760
Now you know how I feel
when you talk

02:57.760 --> 02:59.680
about Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.050
What's confusing?

03:01.050 --> 03:04.220
Everything you need to know
is in the title.

03:04.220 --> 03:05.260
GEORGE JR.:
Dad.

03:05.260 --> 03:07.310
How would you like
to be rich?

03:07.310 --> 03:08.310
Go away.

03:08.310 --> 03:10.190
Aren't you even
a little curious?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.900
Does it involve me
giving you money?

03:11.900 --> 03:14.480
Yeah, but then
I give you more money back.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.820
How much more?

03:15.820 --> 03:17.030
Way more.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.780
You got to get in on this.

03:18.780 --> 03:21.030
(sighs) Thanks.
I'm not interested.

03:21.030 --> 03:22.700
You're gonna regret it.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.950
Show me.

03:25.780 --> 03:27.540
Texas snow globes.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.790
Ooh...

03:28.790 --> 03:30.210
(scoffs softly)
The card store

03:30.210 --> 03:31.870
on Magnolia
is going out of business.

03:31.870 --> 03:34.380
They're selling these
for one dollar each.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.420
I sell 'em for five,
and the money rolls in.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.630
Does it worry you that
the store selling these things

03:39.630 --> 03:41.720
is going out of business?

03:41.720 --> 03:43.050
You have no vision.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.470
Can I get back to the game?

03:44.470 --> 03:45.680
Fine. I don't need your money.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.060
I have my own.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.470
Then why are we having
this conversation?

03:48.470 --> 03:50.560
'Cause I'd rather lose
your money than mine.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.810
See?

03:51.810 --> 03:53.230
Vision.

I've always felt the world
of subatomic particles

03:59.070 --> 04:01.150
would make
an excellent video game.

04:01.150 --> 04:03.660
Uh, fortunately,
thanks to my brain,

04:03.660 --> 04:05.740
I've been playing it for years.

04:07.450 --> 04:08.700
You cheeky little muon,

04:08.700 --> 04:10.410
you know you don't belong there.

04:11.830 --> 04:14.120
Don't look at me.
He's your kid.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.450
Okay.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.000
What do we got here?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.160
Farmhouse Kitchen.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.300
(chuckles nervously)
Okay.

05:11.140 --> 05:14.180
You still want
the crazy kid book, right?

05:15.690 --> 05:17.310
Yeah.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.690

05:24.490 --> 05:26.990
$55.25.

05:26.990 --> 05:28.570
Can't you do any better?

05:28.570 --> 05:29.780
What do you mean?

05:29.780 --> 05:30.990
You're going out of business

05:30.990 --> 05:32.370
and I'm buying 'em all.

05:32.370 --> 05:33.580
Give me a break.

05:33.580 --> 05:34.910
Okay, $50.

05:34.910 --> 05:36.500
$30.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.710

No, wait.

(snorts)

05:53.020 --> 05:55.430
Huh?
(grunts)

05:55.430 --> 05:56.690
Hey, that's clever.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.850
I'm reading this book
about mental problems,

05:58.850 --> 06:00.810
and I'm worried
it sounds like Sheldon.

06:00.810 --> 06:02.230
Well, stop reading the book.

06:02.230 --> 06:05.110
Shelly and Dr. Sturgis
have a lot in common,

06:05.110 --> 06:06.570
and look what happened.

06:06.570 --> 06:08.660
What, you mean
like how he went to...

06:08.660 --> 06:11.370
ADULT SHELDON:
As a society,
we've made strides

06:11.370 --> 06:14.040
in how we discuss
psychological issues.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.040
30 years ago in East Texas,

06:16.040 --> 06:18.210
let's just say we hadn't.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.580
...cuckoo, cuckoo.
(blubbers)

06:20.580 --> 06:21.790
Hey.
(laughs)

06:21.790 --> 06:23.670
That could be your son one day.

06:23.670 --> 06:26.380
(scoffs) Honey, just 'cause
they're both super smart

06:26.380 --> 06:28.430
doesn't mean
that they're the same person.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.890
I mean, Sturgis was in love
with your mom,

06:30.890 --> 06:32.890
so clearly he was nuts
from the get-go.

06:32.890 --> 06:34.100
You're not helping.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.520
I'm not wrong, either.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.770
Love you.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.560
(grunts)

06:44.230 --> 06:46.610
Why aren't you also driving
Missy to school?

06:46.610 --> 06:49.570
I thought it might be
nice for us to chat.

06:49.570 --> 06:50.780
About Missy?

06:50.780 --> 06:52.530
She is a bit much, isn't she?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.240
Here's a question for you.

06:55.240 --> 06:59.580
Do you ever see or hear things
that other people can't?

06:59.580 --> 07:00.790
Oh, all the time.

07:00.790 --> 07:02.540
Right now,
the car antenna is vibrating

07:02.540 --> 07:05.420
at the same frequency
as the pistons in the motor.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.510
It's quite irritating,
but you know me--

07:07.510 --> 07:08.920
I don't complain.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.010
I meant more like things

07:11.010 --> 07:12.590
that aren't actually there.

07:12.590 --> 07:17.140
Ah, isn't that the fundamental
question of modern metaphysics?

07:17.140 --> 07:19.140
What is actually there?

07:19.140 --> 07:20.730
This is fun.

07:20.730 --> 07:23.110
Missy should ride
with Dad more often.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.980
Let me try this a different way.

07:24.980 --> 07:27.730
Um, do you ever feel paranoid,

07:27.730 --> 07:30.030
like people are out to get you?

07:30.030 --> 07:31.280
I'm a ten-year-old
in high school--

07:31.280 --> 07:32.740
people are out to get me.

07:32.740 --> 07:34.200
That's fair.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.290
I just think
if I was having these feelings,

07:37.290 --> 07:39.750
that might be scary, right?

07:39.750 --> 07:41.420
I suppose so.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.630
And this is something
that's been concerning you?

07:45.630 --> 07:47.590
Maybe. Lately.

07:47.590 --> 07:48.920
A little.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.630
But the important thing
is that we can always talk

07:51.630 --> 07:54.470
about this kind of thing
with each other.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.810
Do you have any books
on mental health?

07:57.810 --> 07:59.060
Sure. Why?

07:59.060 --> 08:01.100
I believe my mother
is unraveling.

08:08.630 --> 08:12.920
We have a few books on mental
illness you might find helpful.

08:14.510 --> 08:16.090
This one's a good place
to start.

08:16.090 --> 08:17.720
Have you read it?

08:17.720 --> 08:19.180
Read it, lived it,

08:19.180 --> 08:22.680
made the mistake
of talking about it on a date.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.440
Sure. Walk away.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.440
They all do.

08:41.740 --> 08:43.160
MR. BUSTIFER:
Who is it?

08:43.160 --> 08:45.250
Georgie Cooper.
Who?

08:45.250 --> 08:46.700
I'm your neighbor.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.000
The one
with the chickens?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.250
No.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.630
The ones with that weird,
smart kid?

08:51.630 --> 08:53.170
Yeah, that's my brother.

08:53.170 --> 08:55.050
I don't like that kid.

08:55.050 --> 08:57.170
Neither do I, sir.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.760
What do you want?

08:58.760 --> 09:01.430
I was wondering if you'd like
to buy one of th...

09:02.550 --> 09:04.890
You didn't even see
what I was selling.

09:04.890 --> 09:06.310
What?

09:06.310 --> 09:09.230
Texas snow globes.

09:10.230 --> 09:11.520
Dang it.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.770
See?

09:12.770 --> 09:13.980
It's pretty.

09:13.980 --> 09:15.820
Why would I want that?

09:15.820 --> 09:17.780
Well, um...

09:17.780 --> 09:20.030
b-b-because it's Texas,

09:20.030 --> 09:23.160
and everybody in
Texas loves Texas?

09:25.580 --> 09:27.500
Dang it.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.710
And if you act now,

09:29.710 --> 09:30.960
you can have this beautiful,

09:30.960 --> 09:32.580
limited edition keepsake
in your home

09:32.580 --> 09:36.090
for the low, low price
of only five dollars.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.210
I hope you know I'm missing

09:38.210 --> 09:39.760
People's Court right now.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.180
But with Christmas coming,

09:41.180 --> 09:42.680
this would make
an excellent stocking stuffer.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.010
Well, you're my grandson,

09:44.010 --> 09:45.390
and I love you...

09:46.260 --> 09:47.680
...so it hurts me to do this.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.270
Dang it.

09:52.270 --> 09:54.690
Hmm.

09:55.690 --> 09:57.690
Oh.

09:57.690 --> 09:59.940
Oh, dear.

09:59.940 --> 10:02.110
Oh, no.

10:02.660 --> 10:04.530
Oh, no.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.540
Oh, dear.

10:16.540 --> 10:20.050
Sorry I gave you
the boot before.

10:20.050 --> 10:21.720
Does that mean
you'll buy one now?

10:21.720 --> 10:23.430
No.

10:23.430 --> 10:24.800
You didn't sell
a single snow globe?

10:24.800 --> 10:26.390
Now, don't give your brother
a hard time.

10:26.390 --> 10:28.720
He took some initiative,
and I admire that.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.100
Thank you.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.480
I mean, the snow globes
were silly,

10:31.480 --> 10:33.390
but I bet your next idea
will be great.

10:33.390 --> 10:34.980
They're not silly.

10:34.980 --> 10:37.770
I'm glad you feel that way,
'cause you got 50 of them.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.190
I'm gonna sell them all
just to prove you wrong.

10:40.190 --> 10:41.650
Well, now I know

10:41.650 --> 10:43.700
it's a peeing contest
between you and your daddy,

10:43.700 --> 10:44.910
I'll take two. (chuckles)

10:44.910 --> 10:46.280
Well, all right.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.200
Mom, you're not crazy
about Dad.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.240
Want to buy a snow globe?
Enough.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.660
And I don't like us
making fun of each other.

10:52.660 --> 10:55.420
We're family and this should be
a place that is safe,

10:55.420 --> 10:57.090
where we can
talk about anything.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.000
I agree.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.260
Now, let's just say grace.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.590
(sighs)

11:06.590 --> 11:08.220
Thank you, God,

11:08.220 --> 11:09.890
for this food
we are about to receive,

11:09.890 --> 11:11.520
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.770
And please keep us all
in good health,

11:14.770 --> 11:17.270
body and mind.

11:17.270 --> 11:19.570
Why are you looking at me?

11:19.570 --> 11:22.280
I'm not. Amen.
OTHERS: Amen.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.290
(quietly):
Hello?

11:35.120 --> 11:36.830
Oh, baby.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.750
What are you doing up?

11:38.750 --> 11:40.000
I couldn't sleep.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.460
Why are you up?

11:41.460 --> 11:43.130
Same.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.630
Do you have insomnia
from anxiety?

11:45.630 --> 11:47.800
Is that what you have?

11:48.590 --> 11:49.800
Yes.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.600
What are you anxious about?

11:54.100 --> 11:56.190
Honestly, your mental health.

11:56.190 --> 11:58.270
Me? Why?

11:58.270 --> 12:00.980
Well, you seem
preoccupied lately,

12:00.980 --> 12:03.940
and you were asking me
all those questions in the car.

12:03.940 --> 12:07.490
I was just letting you know that
if you were having any problems

12:07.490 --> 12:09.320
you could come to me with them.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.870
You think I have
mental problems?

12:11.870 --> 12:15.160
Well, not problems.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.670
I'm just worried
about your future,

12:17.670 --> 12:19.790
and when I see you moving...

12:19.790 --> 12:23.170
subatomic particles around
in the air, that makes...

12:23.170 --> 12:24.800
Subatomic particles are real!

12:26.050 --> 12:28.180
You talk to an invisible
man in the sky

12:28.180 --> 12:29.470
who grants wishes.

12:29.470 --> 12:31.260
If anyone's mental, it's you.

12:31.260 --> 12:34.020
Okay, now you are over the line.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.680
You apologize.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.980
No!

12:36.980 --> 12:38.230
What the hell's going on?

12:38.230 --> 12:40.100
Nothing. It's fine.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.690
Mom thinks that I'm crazy.

12:43.020 --> 12:46.780
I thought we weren't supposed
to say stuff like that.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.050
Mother?

12:57.050 --> 12:58.470
Yes?
Is it okay

12:58.470 --> 13:00.470
if I use a knife
to butter my toast,

13:00.470 --> 13:03.230
or are you worried
I'll do something crazy with it?

13:04.310 --> 13:06.060
You can butter your own toast.
Oh, good.

13:06.060 --> 13:07.400
You see the toast, too.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.320
I was afraid I was imagining it.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.780
Sheldon...
GEORGE SR.:
All right,

13:10.780 --> 13:12.320
that's enough.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.650
What's going on?

13:13.650 --> 13:15.820
Nothing's going on.
Everything's fine.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.200
I'll tell you later.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.160
My mother believes
I'm mentally unstable.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.870
And since there's a genetic
component and I'm her child,

13:21.870 --> 13:23.410
I suppose it's possible.

13:24.460 --> 13:25.710
MARY:
I know you're
angry right now,

13:25.710 --> 13:27.880
but you will not be
disrespectful.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.750
You know, fits of rage are
a classic sign of psychosis.

13:30.750 --> 13:33.130
Oh, you haven't seen
fits of rage yet!

13:33.130 --> 13:34.510
I said that's enough!

13:34.510 --> 13:37.010
Both of y'all
are acting like lunatics.

13:37.010 --> 13:38.220
You up to speed?

13:38.220 --> 13:40.640
I think I got it.

13:50.570 --> 13:51.940
(rings doorbell)

13:54.820 --> 13:56.660
I already accepted Jesus
in my heart.

13:56.660 --> 13:59.370
No. I'm selling
these Texas snow globes.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.160
I have enough crap in my house.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.540
Crap?

14:02.540 --> 14:04.250
You love Texas, right?

14:04.250 --> 14:06.120
(sighs):
Well, sure.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.620
And who doesn't like snow?

14:07.620 --> 14:10.710
Sleds and snowball fights.

14:11.710 --> 14:14.010
I remember
it snowed hard here once

14:14.010 --> 14:15.550
when I was a kid.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.380
That must have been amazing.

14:17.380 --> 14:19.640
It was.
They cancelled school.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.310
Me and my brother built
a snow fort in the backyard.

14:22.310 --> 14:23.720
That's cool.
Mm.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.140
My brother and I love
doing stuff together.

14:26.140 --> 14:27.730
We're really close.

14:27.730 --> 14:31.900
I hadn't thought about that day
in a long time.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.150
Well,

14:33.150 --> 14:34.990
what if that memory...

14:34.990 --> 14:37.740
was just one shake away?

14:37.740 --> 14:39.160
How much?

14:39.160 --> 14:40.620
Five dollars.

14:41.410 --> 14:43.700
Fine. I'll take it.

14:44.870 --> 14:46.910
How about you get one
for your brother?

14:46.910 --> 14:48.330
I don't know.

14:48.330 --> 14:51.040
He married some Yankee gal
and moved to Connecticut.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.170
But he's still your brother.

14:53.170 --> 14:54.460
Aw, what the hell.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.340
She's gonna leave him
at some point.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.300
(chuckling)

15:03.560 --> 15:05.850
SHELDON:
I don't see the point of this.

15:05.850 --> 15:09.230
I just don't think it could hurt
for us to talk to someone.

15:09.230 --> 15:10.730
But I could be
home right now

15:10.730 --> 15:12.440
wearing a blindfold,
mittens and nose plug

15:12.440 --> 15:14.190
doing something important.
You know what?

15:14.190 --> 15:15.400
Maybe you should mention

15:15.400 --> 15:17.110
the blindfold and mittens
to the doctor.

15:17.110 --> 15:19.780
Or maybe I'll mention how you
think that God speaks to you,

15:19.780 --> 15:21.450
because I find
that concerning.

15:21.450 --> 15:23.620
He does speak to me,
and right now he's saying

15:23.620 --> 15:25.580
I should wash
your mouth out with soap.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.790
Violent fantasies.

15:27.790 --> 15:29.790

do you remember

15:37.090 --> 15:38.300
where you were

15:38.300 --> 15:39.930
the last time it snowed
in Medford?

15:39.930 --> 15:42.510
(laughs):
We didn't have a carrot
for the snowman's nose,

15:42.510 --> 15:44.720
so can you believe
we used a hot dog?

15:44.720 --> 15:47.020
That must have been a sight.

15:47.020 --> 15:48.680
I was with my grandchildren.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.730
They had never
seen snow before.

15:50.730 --> 15:52.810
I taught 'em
to make snow angels.

15:52.810 --> 15:55.400
Little angels making
little angels.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.030
You can't put a price

Mm.

15:58.030 --> 16:00.150

Hey, little princess.

and was keeping

16:21.840 --> 16:24.090
an eye on him
just to be safe.

16:24.090 --> 16:25.390
It's called being neurotic.

16:25.390 --> 16:27.100
It's called being
a good mother.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.430
This is healthy.

16:28.430 --> 16:30.020
Communication is
the cornerstone...

16:30.020 --> 16:32.020
I am behaving no differently
than I ever have.

16:32.020 --> 16:34.440
Why are you suddenly
so worried about me?

16:34.440 --> 16:35.860
That is a valid question.

16:35.860 --> 16:38.820
Has anything
changed recently?

16:38.820 --> 16:40.030
Well...

16:40.030 --> 16:41.110
Maybe it's hormonal.

16:41.110 --> 16:43.320
When does menopause
typically begin?

16:43.320 --> 16:46.120
It is not my hormones.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.370
Well, it certainly isn't mine.

16:47.370 --> 16:48.950
I'm showing no signs of puberty.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.910
W...

16:51.910 --> 16:54.750
You know, sometimes mothers look
for issues with their children

16:54.750 --> 16:56.630
so they can feel
more needed.
Okay,

16:56.630 --> 16:57.840
now we're getting somewhere.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.710
That is not what's happening.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.550
Well, then what
is happening?

17:04.430 --> 17:05.970
(exhales)

17:07.600 --> 17:10.520
Baby, there's something
I need to tell you.

17:11.730 --> 17:15.480
Dr. Sturgis is not
in the kind of hospital

17:15.480 --> 17:17.270
you think he is.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.440
What kind of
hospital is he in?

17:22.400 --> 17:25.070
The psychiatric kind.

17:25.070 --> 17:27.200
Why? What's going on?

17:27.200 --> 17:28.660
He was having some issues,

17:28.660 --> 17:30.580
but he's getting
the help he needs,

17:30.580 --> 17:33.410
and I'm sure he's gonna be fine.

17:34.580 --> 17:37.540
And you think
since he and I are both gifted,

17:37.540 --> 17:40.090
I'm going to end up like him?

17:41.250 --> 17:43.220
Well, it...
(sighs)

17:43.220 --> 17:45.430
...it crossed my mind.

17:48.510 --> 17:50.680
Sheldon, you're my baby.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.270
It is my job to worry about you.

17:53.270 --> 17:55.100
I can't help it.

17:56.310 --> 17:59.440
I'm sorry I cause you
so much concern.

18:02.110 --> 18:03.780
I'm not.

18:06.030 --> 18:07.530
Oh.

18:07.530 --> 18:09.870
See how valuable
a little communication can be?

18:09.870 --> 18:11.490
You do not take credit for this.

18:24.030 --> 18:26.030

And the turtle

18:26.030 --> 18:28.370

18:28.370 --> 18:30.330
How can you tell?

18:30.330 --> 18:31.540
He's wearing blue.

18:31.540 --> 18:33.210
