the wrong dosage of painkiller.

- Bullshit! There's gonna be
1 0 tons of hot lead in there!

02:08:40.463 --> 02:08:43.548
I keep telling you, I want to die!
We got a deal!

I'm here to help you.
No more bullshit.

- You know who I am?
- You're a droid.

02:13:28.083 --> 02:13:31.085
Same model as Bishop.
Sent by the fucking company.

02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:35.214
No. I'm not the Bishop android.

02:13:35.299 --> 02:13:37.550
I designed it.

02:13:37.634 --> 02:13:40.136
I'm very human.

02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:42.513
The company sent me here
to show you a friendly face,

02:13:42.598 --> 02:13:46.351
to demonstrate
how important you are to us,

02:13:46.435 --> 02:13:48.061
to me.

02:13:48.145 --> 02:13:51.397
- You just want to take it back.
- We want to kill it and take you home.

- Bullshit.
- You're wrong.
We want to help.

02:13:56.070 --> 02:13:58.988
What does that mean?

02:13:59.114 --> 02:14:03.284
We're gonna take that out of you.
And keep it.

02:14:03.369 --> 02:14:07.288
Can't allow it to live.
Everything we know would be in jeopardy.

02:14:09.458 --> 02:14:11.709
You don't want to take it back?

02:14:11.794 --> 02:14:17.548
Ripley, time is important.
Let us deal with the malignancy.

02:14:17.633 --> 02:14:21.677

set up on the rescue ship.

Come with me.
It's very quick.

02:14:25.474 --> 02:14:30.770
Painless. A couple of incisions.
You'll be out for two hours.

you'll know it's dead.

you'll destroy it?

Ripley, think of all
we could learn from it.

It's the chance of a lifetime!

in about six weeks.
