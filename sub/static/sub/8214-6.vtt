01:01.420 --> 01:03.422
Oh, my God.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.738
Final clays! Computers, tablets!

01:12.770 --> 01:15.193
All digital, half price!
Closing sale, today only!

01:15.240 --> 01:17.458
No, thank you. No, no, thanks.
_ Flat screen. _
I give you half price.

01:17.510 --> 01:20.206
You need DVD player?
No one needs
a DVD player.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.673
Come on, Marshall,
they're closing.

01:21.710 --> 01:24.543
That's why the prices
are so low.
MAN: Come on in.

01:24.580 --> 01:26.571
I got good deals for you.
Wsumm

01:27.850 --> 01:29.818
...Elon, right?

01:29.850 --> 01:31.738
No, my name is Ami.

01:31.790 --> 01:34.384
Oh, that's weird
because you told me it was Elon

01:34.420 --> 01:36.752
three weeks ago, when you tried
to sell me a cell phone

01:36.790 --> 01:39.395
at 5:14 pm.
at 22nd and Sixth Avenue.

01:39.430 --> 01:41.898
No, not me.
Yeah.

01:41.930 --> 01:44.194
You. And also again in March.

01:44.230 --> 01:47.597
March 18, 5:28 pm.
26th and Second.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.267
You were having another
going-out—of—business sale.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.266
And, weirdly, here you are,
still in business.

01:51.310 --> 01:53.471
What can I say? Times are tough.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.671
That camcorder right there,

01:55.710 --> 01:57.644
that model is two years old,

01:57.680 --> 01:59.511
and I saw it online
for $255.95,

01:59.550 --> 02:02.280
and you're selling it
"on sale" for $475.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.480
That flat screen TV,

02:03.520 --> 02:05.647
720p, not 1080p,

02:05.690 --> 02:07.214
and if my memory
serves me correctly--

02:07.260 --> 02:09.353
which it pretty much
always does--

02:09.390 --> 02:12.154
it's plasma, not L.E.D.
Okay, lady,

02:12.200 --> 02:13.349
what is your problem?
You want to know

02:13.400 --> 02:15.425
what my problem is? You are
ripping off innocent people

02:15.460 --> 02:17.428
with your phony-baloney
going-out—of—business sale.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.563
Here's the other problem:
I'm a cop.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.931
So unless you want
to go out of business

02:20.970 --> 02:23.666
for real, I suggest
you clean up your act.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.928
Go in there, send Marshall
and his nice girlfriend

02:25.970 --> 02:28.302
on their way, okay?
Whatever you say.

02:28.340 --> 02:29.602
All right. You have a good day.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.869
I'm on my way.

02:38.690 --> 02:39.850
FEMALE OFFICER:
Get back, please.

02:39.890 --> 02:41.380
Get back.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.185
I need you
behind the tape.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.185
Any witnesses?
AL:
Nope.

02:45.230 --> 02:46.595
No sign of a wallet

02:46.630 --> 02:48.894
or phone. Whole thing's
a little funky.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.898
Car's registered
to a big Swiss diplomat

02:50.930 --> 02:52.466
by the name of Lukas Emminger.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.866
I thought maybe car thief,

02:54.900 --> 02:55.969
but it wasn't hot-wired.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.662
Key's in the ignition.

02:58.710 --> 03:02.498
Kid looks too young to be
part of the diplomatic corps.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.743
Why do you take someone's wallet
and cell phone

03:06.780 --> 03:08.338
and leave a car like this?

03:08.380 --> 03:10.644
Meth addict looking
for a few bucks?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.487
Single gunshot wound
to the head?

03:14.020 --> 03:16.682
Maybe our Swiss diplomat
had some enemies.

03:37.810 --> 03:39.516
AL:
Nice ride, huh?

03:39.550 --> 03:40.778
"Nice" hardly covers it.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.641
This slice of heaven goes from
zero to 120 in eight seconds.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.908
Yeah, I had a Dodge Dart Swinger
in high school

03:45.950 --> 03:48.316
that was pretty fast.
A Swinger?

03:48.360 --> 03:50.954
With the flower
over the "I" in the logo?
Yeah, that's right.

03:50.990 --> 03:52.696
I'd forgotten.
Aw, I loved that car.

03:52.730 --> 03:54.618
Okay, boss, if we're
gonna work together

03:54.660 --> 03:56.389
on this case, there's something
you got to understand:

03:56.430 --> 03:59.399
the Ferrari 458 is perhaps
the highest achievement

03:59.440 --> 04:01.897
of automotive engineering
known to man.
I noticed

04:01.940 --> 04:03.498
it didn't have, like,
a cup holder

04:03.540 --> 04:05.758
for the Super Big Chug
from Stop & Fill.

04:05.810 --> 04:09.268
See, I got to have that
in any car I drive.

04:10.410 --> 04:12.617
So when you're done
"examining" the evidence,

04:12.650 --> 04:14.379
be nice if we had an ID.
on our VIctIm.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.944
As a matter of fact,
I was just getting to that.

04:15.980 --> 04:17.743
Our vic's prints aren't
in the system,

04:17.790 --> 04:20.679
_ but it turns out the car was
Involved In a chase last nIght.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.587
Simple traffic stop--
ran through the signal,

04:23.630 --> 04:24.858
then took off.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.323
So, what, some...

04:26.360 --> 04:28.624
rich kid
on a joyride?
Maybe.

04:28.660 --> 04:30.662
DMV confirms our Swiss guy
bought it this week.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.839
That's why there are no plates--
it's still too new.

04:32.870 --> 04:34.895
My money, I'd say
Emminger's our best lead.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.067
Which is why we're heading
to his place in Mamaroneck

04:37.110 --> 04:39.305
for a chat.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.408
Jay, stay on
the dead kid.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.269
Sooner or later,
someone's gonna miss him;

04:43.310 --> 04:45.039
file a missing persons.
You got it.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.541
Come on, a Dodge Swinger?
Really?

04:49.590 --> 04:51.342
Yeah, really.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.958
Ooh!
Your chariot awaits.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.968
Ah. I prefer the subway.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.968
Sure you do.
What's that supposed
to mean?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.467
I don't know.
It's just... you've changed

05:08.500 --> 05:10.707
your look
since we moved out of Queens.

05:10.740 --> 05:11.832
Like what?
Well...

05:11.870 --> 05:14.509
you're not buying your shoes at
Soles4Less anymore.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.508
Come on. One pair
of nice shoes?

05:16.550 --> 05:18.677
First it's the shoes,
then you'll have the Rolex.

05:18.710 --> 05:21.816
You're starting to look
a little bit like Eliot.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.408
Nice. He's snazzy.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.645
Ooh.
Detectives.

05:25.690 --> 05:27.419
Hi.
Please, come in.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.950
Forgive the chaos.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.981
It's always the busiest time
of the day,

05:31.030 --> 05:32.691
getting the children
out to school

05:32.730 --> 05:34.129
and what with the packing.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.798
AL: _
You're movmg?
Yes.

05:35.830 --> 05:38.594
Back to Bern.
We've been in the US. too long.

05:38.630 --> 05:39.790
And my family misses
the mountains.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.604
It seems like an odd time for
you to be buying a new car

05:42.640 --> 05:44.005
right before you leave.
Ah, yes,

05:44.040 --> 05:47.601
the vehicle that you mentioned
on the phone.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.746
You see, it makes a great deal
of financial sense for me

05:50.780 --> 05:53.476
to buy a car of that price
and then to ship it home.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.112
I'm head of the Division
of Economic Affairs,

05:55.150 --> 05:58.119
so you'll forgive me
ifI take a little pride

05:58.150 --> 06:00.084
in knowing
how to strike a bargain.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.089
I'm not sure how you're gonna
feel about your bargain now.

06:04.460 --> 06:05.950
That's my car?

06:05.990 --> 06:08.652
Mmm.
What, you didn't...
know it was missing?

06:08.700 --> 06:09.997
It was never delivered.

06:10.030 --> 06:11.793
I ordered it from a dealer,

06:11.830 --> 06:13.798
Nick Castigan
at Heritage Classics.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.762
They said that they would
bring it to me.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.700
You bought a $400,000 car
and you didn't check

06:17.740 --> 06:18.638
to see if it was here?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.638
Well, this might be hard
for you to believe,

06:20.680 --> 06:22.500
but my life is full
of many things

06:22.550 --> 06:24.905
that are more important
than automobiles.

06:24.950 --> 06:27.043
Do you recognize
that young man?
No.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.741
Not at all.

06:28.780 --> 06:30.816
This is terrible.
What happened?
We think someone

06:30.850 --> 06:32.511
may be targeting you.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.653
I'm a commercial attach.

06:34.690 --> 06:38.182
Basically, I take meetings
and read contracts.
It would help

06:38.230 --> 06:40.824
if you could get us a list
of your recent dealings.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.067
Oh, uh, of course. Uh,

06:43.100 --> 06:44.920
it's highly sensitive material,
but I'll see what I can do.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.460
One moment.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.536
Excuse us.
Helen. You...

06:48.570 --> 06:50.765
look beautiful.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.199
Peter, good luck
on your history test.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.435
And Celine...

06:55.480 --> 06:57.675
you have a wonderful day,
all right?

06:57.710 --> 06:59.575
I'll follow you out
in a minute.
All right.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.486
Do you think they're
in any danger?

07:03.520 --> 07:05.147
We have to assume
they may be.

07:05.190 --> 07:07.055
I'd like to have someone
posted out front

07:07.090 --> 07:08.352
and to accompany
you and your family.

07:08.390 --> 07:11.655
That won't be necessary.
The consulate provides
for our security.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.499
No, not the paintings.

07:13.530 --> 07:16.021
Please, take the couch first.
MAN: Yes, sir.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.722
Oh, and extend my sympathy
to the boy's family.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.169
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.088
EMMINGER:
This way.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.238
AL:
All right.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.909
Jay ran some background
on Emminger. Nothing.

07:27.940 --> 07:29.578
You know, guys
like him make me

07:29.610 --> 07:31.749
miss the creeps we had
to deal with in Queens.

07:31.780 --> 07:32.678
Really? You miss

07:32.720 --> 07:34.870
One
Iloved

07:34.920 --> 07:36.114
One-Eyed Danny
the drug dealer.

07:38.550 --> 07:41.587
NICK:
God, that's Ezequiel.

07:41.620 --> 07:42.689
Ezequiel Nadal.
Mmm.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.254
He's one
of my best delivery guys.

07:44.290 --> 07:45.689
What happened?
We're hoping

07:45.730 --> 07:47.721
you could fill some things in
for us.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.524
You say you gave him the keys to
Emminger's vehicle at what time?

07:50.570 --> 07:52.834
3:00
Anything

07:52.870 --> 07:54.735
seem odd or different

07:54.770 --> 07:57.261
about Ezequiel yesterday?
NICK:
No, not at all.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.663
He's a good kid.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.928
I gave him the car,
the location,

08:00.980 --> 08:03.141
and he went on his way-- he was
here maybe 20 minutes tops.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.807
This is terrible.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.512
Mr. Castigan, we had some
trouble identifying him.

08:07.550 --> 08:08.676
Do you have contact info
for him?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.119
Home address?

08:10.150 --> 08:11.242
Phone?
Sure.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.848
Let me dig it out for you.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.594
MAN: I didn't know
he had another job.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.723
He never mentioned
a delivery JOb to me.

08:25.770 --> 08:28.967
Francisco?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.865
He worked here,
you know, in the garage.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.571
Ever since
his mother died

08:32.610 --> 08:34.168
two years ago--
day and night.

08:34.210 --> 08:36.178
Worked harder than me
and his brother combined.

08:36.210 --> 08:37.575
AL:
And he never mentioned

08:37.610 --> 08:40.170
Heritage Classics
or Nick Castigan?

08:40.220 --> 08:42.211
No.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.743
I walked him to
school every day.

08:45.790 --> 08:47.018
It's only three blocks,

08:47.060 --> 08:50.985
but I was always worried
that something...

08:51.030 --> 08:53.999
He begged 'me to stop.

08:54.030 --> 08:56.590
He was so embarrassed.

08:56.630 --> 08:59.758
I finally did
when he turned 17.

09:02.810 --> 09:06.302
Papi, your office.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.069
Let it ring.

09:10.810 --> 09:13.574
CARRIE:
Francisco, right?

09:13.620 --> 09:16.839
Do you mind if Francisco
shows me Ezequiel's bedroom?

09:24.260 --> 09:25.784
You live here
your whole life?

09:25.830 --> 09:27.149
Mm-hmm.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.309
FRANCISCO:
No.

09:38.340 --> 09:40.035
This is my room.
Oh.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.902
Ezequiel's is down here.
Okay.

09:44.910 --> 09:46.810
What happened to your face?

09:47.850 --> 09:50.045
I fell off my bike.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.978
Some fall.

10:04.730 --> 10:07.699
Francisco, was your brother
in any kind of trouble?

10:07.740 --> 10:10.629
Something maybe your father
didn't need to know about?

10:12.980 --> 10:14.732
You guys were close, huh?

10:17.950 --> 10:20.919
You know, he, uh...

10:20.950 --> 10:24.340
he-he was wearing
an expensive suit, but I...

10:24.390 --> 10:26.858
I don't see anything
like that around here.

10:26.890 --> 10:28.778
I don't know anything
about a suit.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.788
Did he seem to have
more money lately?

10:30.830 --> 10:32.957
Did you notice
anything like that?
No.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.696
I think he might have owed
somebody some money.

10:35.730 --> 10:37.425
Do you know who?
He never said.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.030
He just mentioned something
in passing.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.439
What about a girlfriend?

10:42.470 --> 10:44.734
Any friends maybe
I should talk to?

10:44.770 --> 10:45.805
No girlfriend.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.070
Ezy didn't have friends
like that.

10:48.110 --> 10:49.407
No time.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.044
He worked.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.047
That's all he did.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.047
In the morning,

10:53.080 --> 10:55.219
he made the runs
to the auto supply warehouses,

10:55.250 --> 10:56.911
and then in the garage
till after midnight,

10:56.950 --> 10:58.815
just trying
to get the cars done.

10:58.850 --> 11:00.818
Soundstough.
He had a dream about

11:00.860 --> 11:02.282
getting out of this place,

11:02.320 --> 11:04.823
this crappy
neighborhood.

11:04.860 --> 11:06.179
He could have done it, too.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.390
I bet he could.

11:07.430 --> 11:08.920
What about you, Francisco?

11:08.960 --> 11:10.166
You have the same dream?

11:10.200 --> 11:12.418
Sometimes. Sure I do.

11:12.470 --> 11:14.267
Well, then, it'll happen.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.939
You just got to stay
on your bike.

11:16.970 --> 11:19.461
Listen, if you think

11:19.510 --> 11:22.707
of anything,
or you just want to talk...

11:22.750 --> 11:24.741
you come ﬁnd me, okay?

11:26.310 --> 11:29.074
Thanks.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.915
Okay, my preliminary indicates

11:33.960 --> 11:37.987
he was clean--
no drugs or alcohol at all.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.258
Handsome boy.

11:39.290 --> 11:40.826
Yeah.

11:40.860 --> 11:44.728
Okay, powder burns around
the entry wound indicate

11:44.770 --> 11:46.192
the gun was close.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.892
Close enough to see his face,
even if it was dark?

11:48.940 --> 11:51.204
The barrel was within
two to three inches.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.970
Whoever shot him knew
he was not Emminger.

11:54.010 --> 11:56.376
And all of Switzerland
sighs in relief.

11:56.410 --> 12:00.039
Mm-hmm. It was a .22
caliber round, by the way,

12:00.080 --> 12:02.514
which is unusual for
a profeSSIonal job.

12:02.550 --> 12:05.110
Okay, so if it's not
a professional hit,

12:05.150 --> 12:06.481
then, maybe it's personal.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.488
Maybe he knew his killer.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.056
I vote he knew him.

12:10.090 --> 12:11.250
Here, take a look.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.392
Right here.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.179
His brother had those markings
on his wall.

12:29.210 --> 12:31.269
I'm thinking gang markings.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.973
Mm... maybe.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.011
Thanks, Jo.

12:37.050 --> 12:39.041
Anytime.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.868
Whoa. Hey.
Oh.

12:49.900 --> 12:50.924
Dirty.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.097
Uh, sorry, but

12:53.140 --> 12:54.437
you got to know
that the triple X

12:54.470 --> 12:55.459
designation stands
for a lot of things.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.536
I set the safe search as
high as I could, but...

12:57.570 --> 12:59.902
Maybe we should
give this one to Murray.

12:59.940 --> 13:02.079
No, no, I'm on it.
All right.

13:06.610 --> 13:09.272
Wait a second.
There, that guy, right there.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.898
There was a picture of that guy
in Ezequiel's room.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.397
What is this?

13:22.430 --> 13:25.160
Uh... message board.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.134
Brotherhood
of Street Racers. Wow.

13:27.170 --> 13:28.398
All right,
refine your search.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.261
Triple X and-and
street racers.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.835
We got it.
Looks like the Triple X

13:33.880 --> 13:35.836
Burnouts is a crew working in
and around Washington Heights.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.905
All right, so Ezequiel and
his brother were members

13:37.950 --> 13:40.043
of a street racing club.

13:40.080 --> 13:43.117
You know, Francisco said
Ezequiel owed somebody money.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.947
Well...

13:44.990 --> 13:47.959
our guy here's the leader--
Steven McKinnon.

13:47.990 --> 13:49.389
Maybe Ezequiel owed him?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.162
This can't be right.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.201
Yes, it can.

14:14.250 --> 14:17.310
Hey, I'm Carrie Wells
with the NYPD. This is

14:17.350 --> 14:18.612
A! Burns...
Is this about Stevie?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.914
Yeah.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.483
Stevie!

14:25.530 --> 14:28.124
Get up! Now!

14:28.160 --> 14:31.368
He comes in all hours,

14:31.400 --> 14:33.129
then he sleeps all day,
and I worry,

14:33.170 --> 14:34.899
but he says,
"Don't worry, Mom.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.237
"I'm a grown man.

14:36.270 --> 14:37.464
I have my own life."

14:37.510 --> 14:39.466
Would you like some sausage?

14:39.510 --> 14:42.104
Stevi_e loves _
the organic andowlle.

14:42.140 --> 14:43.243
Oh, no, thank you.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.248
That's more Al's
speed than me.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.646
Do you know your son's involved
in street racing?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.045
Street racing?!

14:49.080 --> 14:50.388
In that piece
of junk?

14:50.420 --> 14:52.638
It's in the shop every week.
Then I have

14:52.690 --> 14:55.352
to take him to his Pilates
class, and then drive him

14:55.390 --> 14:56.516
to therapy.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.118
I'm telling you,
it's a nightmare.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.127
Stevie!

14:59.160 --> 15:00.923
There are people

15:00.960 --> 15:02.120
here!

15:02.160 --> 15:04.469
STEVIE:
Coming, Ma. Geez!

15:04.500 --> 15:06.991
Did you make
the gluten

15:07.040 --> 15:08.462
My celiac is kicking up.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.934
Oh.
The police, Stevie.

15:10.970 --> 15:13.029
What do you have to
say for yourself?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.207
I paid those tickets.
No, Steven.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.504
We're here to talk about
Francisco and Ezequiel Nadal.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.539
And the Triple X

15:18.580 --> 15:20.411
street racing crew.

15:20.450 --> 15:21.712
Street racing, Stevie?

15:21.750 --> 15:23.388
Li-Listen,
you-you want my keys,

15:23.420 --> 15:25.149
just take

15:25.190 --> 15:27.249
But-but you can't
prove anything. Ooh.

15:27.290 --> 15:28.587
Stevie!
Oh, you got to
be kidding me.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.559
Hey!

15:37.600 --> 15:39.329
Oh, no.

15:39.370 --> 15:40.359
Let me drive!

15:40.400 --> 15:41.435
I ran a 10K here once.

15:41.470 --> 15:43.233
I know this neighborhood
like the back of my hand.

15:43.270 --> 15:44.362
My car, I drive.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.502
You navigate.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.974
I love it_
when you're articulate.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.672
You know, I would have
caught him by now.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.585
Had a head start.
Al, open it up!

15:57.620 --> 15:59.383
Come on, put your foot
on the gas.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.058
CARRIE:
Faster, faster, faster! Whoo!

16:01.090 --> 16:02.580
There you go.

16:02.620 --> 16:05.123
You gotta get
his attention.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.479
Get his attention.
Maybe he doesn't see us.

16:09.630 --> 16:11.188
Now, that is just
a little love tap.

16:11.230 --> 16:12.390
You gotta get his attention.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.403
Whoo!
Come on!

16:20.640 --> 16:22.528
What's he got in that thing?

16:30.750 --> 16:32.286
He's gonna go straight.
Don't follow him.
What?

16:32.320 --> 16:33.582
I know where
we can cut him off.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.156
Of course you do.
Yeah.

16:36.390 --> 16:37.357
Whoa! Watch out!

16:37.390 --> 16:38.357
Take a left.
I know a shortcut.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.739
Go straight past this house with
the lighthouse out front of it.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.637
You're like a human GPS.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.142
Hang a right at the picket fence
on the next block.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.384
You know how fast we're going?
How fast?

17:06.490 --> 17:08.412
Picket fence!
Picket fence!

17:12.590 --> 17:15.150
Stop at the corner.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.458
He could have
passed us.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.832
Wait for it...

17:33.350 --> 17:34.044
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:46.760 --> 17:50.161
You... you guys
have insurance, right?

17:50.200 --> 17:51.565
Shut up!

17:56.440 --> 17:57.668
Quite an interesting life
you lead, Steven.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.665
Yeah, it's all right.

17:58.710 --> 18:01.577
I had a nice little chat
with Francisco Nadal.

18:01.610 --> 18:03.271
He tells me you're
the one responsible

18:03.310 --> 18:04.402
for pounding his face.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.769
And that's why I ran.

18:05.810 --> 18:08.244
See, I knew
that kid was a punk ass.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.214
So, we're starting
with an assault charge,

18:10.250 --> 18:12.582
then evading, maybe
a moving violation or two.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.156
Top it off
with murder and I'd say

18:14.190 --> 18:15.680
this has been
a pretty good day for me.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.358
Yeah, I didn't
kill Ezequiel, all right?

18:17.390 --> 18:19.620
I run a street-racing crew.
I'm not a murderer.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.128
No, you just beat the
crap out of 17-year-olds.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.697
He owed me a lot of money
and wasn't paying up.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.664
Didn't Ezequiel owe you, too?
Hell, no.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.634
Ezequiel didn't
owe anybody ever.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.467
He never_los_t a race
in his life.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.205
His brother, though...

18:32.240 --> 18:33.275
Francisco.

18:33.310 --> 18:34.538
Yeah. I mean,

18:34.580 --> 18:37.606
this kid lost two
big-money races back to back,

18:37.650 --> 18:40.813
so when I...
put the squeeze on him,

18:40.850 --> 18:43.410
Ezequiel stepped up and said
he would pay the debt.

18:43.450 --> 18:46.146
He was supposed to meet me
last night with the money,

18:46.190 --> 18:47.418
but he never showed.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.449
How much money?

18:48.490 --> 18:49.479
Ten grand.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.158
I'm never
gonna see it now.

18:51.190 --> 18:53.158
I can't put the screws to a kid
whose brother got killed.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.497
Yeah, that wouldn't be right.

18:54.530 --> 18:55.849
No way, no how.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.492
Ezequiel had a
job delivering

18:57.530 --> 18:58.622
sports cars.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.399
Could he have been bringing one
to you to pay you back?

19:00.440 --> 19:03.261
Nah. I couldn't do anything
with a stolen car.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.268
All right, if you needed $10,000
in a hurry, where would you go?

19:06.310 --> 19:09.438
My uncle.
He's a dermatologist...

19:09.480 --> 19:10.902
Ezequiel, Steven. Ezequiel.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.612
Okay, and-and I had
access to a Ferrari

19:13.650 --> 19:15.470
or a Porsche
or something?
Yeah.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.409
Chop shop. Cash money,
no questions asked.

19:18.450 --> 19:19.781
They love those rides.

19:19.820 --> 19:22.414
Strip 'em down, ship 'em out
in a matter of hours-- boom.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.825
Boom.

19:23.860 --> 19:26.420
AL:
I had to pry this out

19:26.460 --> 19:27.688
of the precinct's hands,

19:27.730 --> 19:28.958
but they finally sent it over.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.422
Dash cam from the cruiser

19:30.470 --> 19:32.426
that pursued Ezequiel
when he blew that light.

19:32.470 --> 19:34.859
All for a stupid
stop light.
Mm.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.492
Why'd he run?

19:36.540 --> 19:38.838
He knew if they caught him,
they'd impound the car.

19:38.870 --> 19:40.679
Without the car,
he'd never get the money

19:40.710 --> 19:42.337
to clear his brother
and get out.

19:42.380 --> 19:44.405
That car was his ticket
to a new life.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.202
And that's the crime.
Mm. So,

19:46.250 --> 19:47.615
he's headed to a chop shop.

19:47.650 --> 19:48.969
I figured maybe it's somewhere
in the neighborhood

19:49.020 --> 19:50.214
where he blew the light.

19:50.250 --> 19:53.708
I did a quick cross-reference
of the neighborhood and found...

19:53.760 --> 19:54.988
Hold on.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.578
Hey, you need
help with that?

19:56.620 --> 19:58.679
No, no, no, no... I got this.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.618
Uh... there.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.218
Like I said,

20:02.260 --> 20:03.727
I ran a search on
all the garages

20:03.770 --> 20:05.590
in the area,
cross-referenced . ..

20:05.630 --> 20:06.824
That's the term you use,
right, Jay?

20:06.870 --> 20:08.599
Cross-referenced
With criminal

20:08.640 --> 20:09.629
violations and

20:09.670 --> 20:11.331
found...

20:11.370 --> 20:13.679
Juno's on 11th Avenue.

20:13.710 --> 20:16.873
Auto body shop registered
to Alma Delaney.

20:16.910 --> 20:19.743
Convicted in Jersey
on a variety of charges,

20:19.780 --> 20:22.442
including
receiving stolen goods.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.313
Recently moved her shop
from North Bergen.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.011
That's, uh,
incredible.

20:27.050 --> 20:29.610
Yeah. Carrie and I
are headed over there right now.

20:29.660 --> 20:31.355
Oh, no, I meant,
it's incredible that,

20:31.390 --> 20:33.722
uh, you did all this
computer stuff by yourself.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.897
What's the matter, Jay?

20:34.930 --> 20:36.352
Afraid you're gonna be obsolete?

20:36.400 --> 20:37.560
Yeah.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.897
Yeah, right...

20:38.930 --> 20:41.364
Did you help him?
No.

20:43.970 --> 20:46.359
AL: These are some pretty
nice cars, Ms. Delaney.

20:46.410 --> 20:47.536
Seems like
these are the ones

20:47.580 --> 20:48.899
always get the dings,
am I right?

20:48.940 --> 20:50.646
Hey, you get that Charger

20:50.680 --> 20:53.513
of yours knocked around,
Detective, I'll take care of ya.

20:53.550 --> 20:54.778
Yeah? Thanks.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.913
Now I'm assuming
you have contact info

20:56.950 --> 20:58.645
for the owners of
these vehicles?

20:58.690 --> 21:00.783
Of course! Back in the office.

21:00.820 --> 21:03.050
Uh, might take a while to find.

21:03.090 --> 21:05.024
I-I'm not so good
with the filing.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.254
Before you do that,

21:06.290 --> 21:09.418
tell me if you've ever seen
this young man before.
Uh...

21:09.460 --> 21:10.688
No.
He wasn't here

21:10.730 --> 21:11.992
night before last?
No.

21:12.030 --> 21:13.930
Handsome kid like that,
I'd remember.

21:13.970 --> 21:15.062
Even at my age, right?

21:15.100 --> 21:16.397
You're sure?

21:16.440 --> 21:17.600
You want to take a longer look?

21:17.640 --> 21:19.631
DELANEY:
No. My lungs is bad,
not my eyesight.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.570
Never seen him.

21:27.950 --> 21:30.839
What are these scratches here?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.084
What are you talking about?

21:32.120 --> 21:33.815
VVhat

21:33.860 --> 21:35.657
I got a car with scratches
just like these.

21:35.690 --> 21:37.783
_ A Ferrari. It's evidence
in a murder investigation.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.628
The murder of Ezequiel Nadal.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.025
I told you,
I never seen the kid before.

21:42.060 --> 21:43.425
I don't know nothing

21:43.470 --> 21:44.698
about no murder.

21:44.730 --> 21:46.561
You know about
the Organized Crime Control Act?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.067
What's that?

21:48.100 --> 21:49.988
It's the law
that makes running a chop shop

21:50.040 --> 21:51.860
for stolen car parts illegal.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.378
There's also a little thing
called obstructing a murder

21:54.410 --> 21:56.674
investigation, so unless
you want to be making

21:56.710 --> 21:58.940
the license plates you're
currently removing off

21:58.980 --> 22:00.538
of stolen cars, I suggest

22:00.580 --> 22:02.639
you take another look
at the picture.

22:04.420 --> 22:07.617
A-All right, uh,
he, he was here.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.718
VVhen?

22:08.760 --> 22:09.852
Couple of days ago.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.528
He was trying
to sell me something,

22:11.560 --> 22:13.494
but I-I wouldn't touch
a car like that.

22:13.530 --> 22:14.519
Because it was stolen?

22:14.560 --> 22:15.458
Because it was fake.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.455
Fake?!

22:16.500 --> 22:17.660
I see it all the time.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.918
That-That's why we do the
scratches-- to test the paint.

22:19.970 --> 22:22.791
Ferrari has a patent
on their colors--

22:22.840 --> 22:24.501
made only for them.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.428
I did the test myself,
and it failed.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.630
I-I sent him on his way.

22:29.540 --> 22:31.747
Faux watches, sunglasses--
we all know about those,

22:31.780 --> 22:32.747
but the world

22:32.780 --> 22:33.872
of fake luxury cars

22:33.920 --> 22:35.740
is a multimillion-dollar
busmess.

22:35.780 --> 22:39.147
Cars shine on the outside,
engine parts not so much.

22:39.190 --> 22:41.954
"Faux

22:41.990 --> 22:43.548
MURRAY:
Buyers know what
they're getting?

22:43.590 --> 22:44.784
Maybe.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.127
I'm gonna say most don't.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.889
Most folks probably can't tell
the difference.

22:47.930 --> 22:50.660
I mean, some people think that
a Dodge Swinger is a slick ride.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.089
Okay, so you put down
half a mi! on one of these,

22:53.130 --> 22:55.894
then you find out
you've been ripped off.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.430
Guys have been shot
for less.

22:57.470 --> 22:59.131
Yeah, but why take it out
on the delivery boy?

22:59.170 --> 23:02.799
I mean, I'd go after the guy
who sold me the car.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.775
The gate is down.

23:05.810 --> 23:07.641
What's he doing closed,
middle of the day?

23:07.680 --> 23:09.375
Don't know.

23:11.650 --> 23:13.811
Hey, Al, it looks like
the place has been tossed.

23:22.830 --> 23:23.990
NYPD.

23:53.800 --> 23:54.892
Thanks.

23:54.930 --> 23:57.524
Webster confirms
Castigan was killed

23:57.570 --> 23:58.923
by a single shot
to the head

23:58.970 --> 24:00.995
a few_hours before
we arrived on scene.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.600
Okay, so either some buyer
figured out he bought a fake,

24:03.640 --> 24:05.699
kills Castigan
to settle the score,

24:05.740 --> 24:08.538
or the guys who make these
cars want their little scam

24:08.580 --> 24:10.207
kept quiet.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.776
Would explain
taking out Ezequiel,

24:11.810 --> 24:13.107
if he'd tripped
to what was up.

24:13.150 --> 24:14.811
You guys okay?
I heard about Castigan.

24:14.850 --> 24:15.748
Oh, the place was trashed,

24:15.780 --> 24:17.987
but whoever did
Castigan was long gone.

24:18.020 --> 24:20.682
And, uh,
how were the cars?

24:20.720 --> 24:22.585
I think they're
gonna pull through.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.258
Did you have
something for me?

24:24.290 --> 24:25.188
Couple things.

24:25.230 --> 24:27.084
One, we checked
Ezequiel's phone records.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.519
The night he was killed,
he got a text asking him

24:29.560 --> 24:30.527
to meet in the very location

24:30.570 --> 24:31.662
where he was shot.

24:31.700 --> 24:34.066
Number tracked to a burner cell,
so no way to trace it.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.239
But it confirms what we're
thinking-- he knew his killer.

24:36.270 --> 24:37.237
What else?

24:37.270 --> 24:38.237
Aha, check this out.

24:38.270 --> 24:39.464
On Castigan,

24:39.510 --> 24:42.775
I tried to get an idea of what
kind of inventory he moved,

24:42.810 --> 24:44.675
so I _ran a search
on Heritage Cla55ics--

24:44.710 --> 24:46.746
Google Street View,
satellites, maps, anything.

24:49.150 --> 24:51.209
These are over six months.

24:51.250 --> 24:53.582
But take a look:
It's always the same cars.

24:53.620 --> 24:54.814
He shifts 'em around,

24:54.860 --> 24:56.111
but I don't think
he's selling anything.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.855
So Heritage is what,
just a front?

24:57.890 --> 25:00.654
You order the cars, they gotta
come from an importer, right?

25:00.700 --> 25:02.793
I think Castigan just arranges
the fake titles

25:02.830 --> 25:05.219
and registrations, and delivers
the fake cars to the buyers.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.226
We gotta find who's bringing in
these cars.

25:07.270 --> 25:10.603
Problem is, whoever killed
Castigan cleaned out his files.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.734
Yeah, the DMV keeps records
of where cars are purchased.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.600
You don't even have to wait
in line to get 'em.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.074
Voila, all the buyers
whose cars came by way

25:18.110 --> 25:19.577
of the late Mr. Castigan.

25:19.610 --> 25:21.874
Our diplomat Emminger's name's
on here twice.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.717
JAY:
Three times, actually.

25:23.750 --> 25:26.241
The Ferrari and
Aston Martin DB7 Vantage

25:26.290 --> 25:28.554
and a Lamborghini Gallardo.
Are you serious?

25:28.590 --> 25:30.649
Give me a few hours
in that garage.

25:30.690 --> 25:31.884
They're fake, Jay.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.659
Right.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.997
Why would Emminger not mention

25:35.030 --> 25:36.588
he bought other cars
from Heritage?

25:36.630 --> 25:37.824
Maybe we should ask him.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.667
Yeah, Carrie and I'll
head out there.

25:39.700 --> 25:43.602
Yeah. Um, maybe you should talk
to Eliot first?

25:45.040 --> 25:46.928
Yeah.

25:46.970 --> 25:49.939
I am not interfering
with your investigation.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.675
I didn't say,
"interfering with," I said...

25:51.710 --> 25:52.745
I know what you said.

25:52.780 --> 25:54.941
The particular word you used
was very evocative.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.777
Eliot, we have a list of people

25:56.820 --> 25:58.242
who were ripped off
buying phony cars.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.144
Our killer is probably
on that list.

26:00.190 --> 26:02.055
And I simply wanted
to review that list,

26:02.090 --> 26:03.182
maybe save you guys some time.

26:03.220 --> 26:05.723
Review?
I'm feeling the need
to use that word again.

26:05.760 --> 26:06.579
Guys, come on.

26:06.630 --> 26:07.927
There's some big names
on this list.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.029
You are so right.

26:09.060 --> 26:11.790
There are some huge names
on this list. Enormous.

26:11.830 --> 26:13.661
Francis Rhinelander
Fitzwallace.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.736
That is a big name.
Lots of letters...

26:15.770 --> 26:17.294
Very big name, yeah.
...in that name.
It's huge.

26:17.340 --> 26:19.035
Okay, I'll spell it out for you.

26:19.070 --> 26:21.072
People who spend half
a million dollars on cars

26:21.110 --> 26:22.338
tend to be rich.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.870
And rich people are friends

26:23.910 --> 26:25.798
with, one, other rich people,
and two,

26:25.850 --> 26:27.670
elected officials,

26:27.720 --> 26:29.938
some of whom can occasionally be
useful to us.

26:29.980 --> 26:32.744
I knew you had other agendas,
but you are another agenda.

26:32.790 --> 26:34.018
I am simply asking...

26:34.060 --> 26:36.915
...that we stay away from the
mayor's golfing buddies-- yes.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.121
Not stay away, just approach
with some discretion.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.320
That's all.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.352
Discretion.
Good. Carrie?

26:43.400 --> 26:44.992
Great. Okay.

26:45.030 --> 26:47.066
Uh, uh, where
are you going?

26:47.100 --> 26:49.091
Well...

26:49.140 --> 26:50.937
Lukas Emminger--
he's first on that list.

26:50.970 --> 26:52.961
No. See, this is what
I'm talking about.

26:53.010 --> 26:55.331
You know you broke about
75 diplomatic protocols

26:55.380 --> 26:57.007
that last time _
you questioned him.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.907
Yeah, but we're
gonna be discreet.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.049
By the way,

27:03.080 --> 27:04.889
the mayor doesn't play golf
anymore.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.911
He tore his rotator cuff.

27:09.320 --> 27:13.029
AL: Mr. Emminger,
do you have a second?

27:13.060 --> 27:14.789
Of course.
Go ahead, Philippe.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.252
I'll be in in a moment.

27:16.300 --> 27:17.995
Detectives, any luck with that
poor young man:

27:18.030 --> 27:21.090
No, not yet, but we did
discover that you bought,

27:21.140 --> 27:23.062
in fact, three cars
from Heritage Classics.

27:23.100 --> 27:27.059
I'm not sure I see the relevance
of my automobile purchases

27:27.110 --> 27:28.668
in a murder investigation.

27:28.710 --> 27:29.972
Just wondering why
you didn't mention that

27:30.010 --> 27:30.840
in the first interview.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.745
Well, frankly,
I find that dimension

27:32.780 --> 27:34.270
of my job as a trade attach

27:34.320 --> 27:36.276
better left undisclosed.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.742
While not strictly illegal--

27:37.790 --> 27:39.018
I'll be in in a moment.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.279
It could be misinterpreted.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.288
All right, and that could be
uncomfortable for you.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.752
I'm glad you understand.

27:45.790 --> 27:46.757
Mm.

27:46.790 --> 27:47.427
So these cars you bought,

27:47.460 --> 27:48.427
they were gifts, yeah?

27:48.460 --> 27:50.348
Yes, to friends.
Oh.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.960
I believe, in this country
you call it "lobbying."

27:53.000 --> 27:55.161
Actually, in this country,
we call it "bribery."

27:55.200 --> 27:58.067
Imagine, had you
discovered yourself

27:58.110 --> 28:00.931
that these gifts were fake,
you'd be a little upset.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.299
What do you mean, fake?

28:03.810 --> 28:08.042
Wait-- you weren't aware
that the cars you bought

28:08.080 --> 28:10.241
from Heritage Classics
were counterfeit?

28:10.280 --> 28:15.456
Oh, I see. No, I was not aware.

28:15.490 --> 28:18.254
Mr. Emminger, it occurred to us
that realizing you paid

28:18.290 --> 28:20.997
$2 million for fake cars

28:21.030 --> 28:22.497
might make
some people very angry.

28:22.530 --> 28:26.068
Oh, I assure you I had no idea
the cars were illegitimate.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.159
Have you spoken to Nick Castigan
in the past two days?

28:32.470 --> 28:35.075
Detectives, I hope
I've been of some help,

28:35.110 --> 28:36.771
but I'm afraid
I'm being rude.

28:36.810 --> 28:40.302
Perhaps, if you need
any further communication
with me

28:40.350 --> 28:41.977
you can arrange it
through the consulate.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.078
Thank you. Good day.

28:45.190 --> 28:47.078
You know, he seemed
genuinely surprised.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.212
I thought so, too.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.010
Hmm.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.221
By the way, you were
very discreet.

28:51.260 --> 28:52.420
Nice discretion.

28:52.460 --> 28:53.950
You were pretty good.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.719
You couldn't help yourself
with the bribery line.

29:00.330 --> 29:03.299
Jay, how you doing
finding the importer?

29:03.340 --> 29:04.307
Glad you asked.
I've been searching

29:04.340 --> 29:06.831
for the point of entry
on the Heritage vehicles.

29:06.870 --> 29:07.939
Looks like

29:07.980 --> 29:09.379
they could've come in
at several spots

29:09.410 --> 29:10.274
along the Eastern seaboard.

29:10.310 --> 29:12.403
So then I thought,
what if I track Ezequiel

29:12.450 --> 29:14.509
the night he was killed,
see where he might have
made his pickup?

29:14.550 --> 29:17.269
Turns out our boy
had a PATH Smartlink card,

29:17.320 --> 29:18.912
which took him to Jersey City,

29:18.950 --> 29:21.282
home to the Port Authority's
Vehicle Preparation Center.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.651
Got a name for us?

29:22.690 --> 29:25.284
Almost. There are
literally, like, hundreds
of importers down there.

29:25.330 --> 29:27.480
I'm trying
to get some security footage.

29:27.530 --> 29:29.225
Jersey City, huh?

29:32.230 --> 29:33.299
CASTIGAN:
This is terrible.

29:33.330 --> 29:34.968
Ezequiel Nadal--

29:35.000 --> 29:38.231
he's one of my best
delivery guys.

29:38.270 --> 29:39.862
VVhat

29:39.910 --> 29:41.377
AL:
Well, maybe you can fill
some things in for us.

29:41.410 --> 29:43.901
You say you gave him the keys
to Emminger's vehicle

29:43.950 --> 29:45.144
at what time?

29:45.180 --> 29:47.341
CASTGIAN:
3:00, 3:30.

29:49.180 --> 29:50.886
Krinkowski Limited.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.979
You got that on
your list of importers?

29:55.520 --> 29:57.385
J_AY:
Bingo.

30:10.500 --> 30:14.334
Listen, my pops started this
business 40-odd years ago.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.031
We brought in three, four
million cars through here.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.503
Never one iota of trouble.

30:19.550 --> 30:20.972
Nick Castigan,
Heritage Classics.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.009
You heard of him?

30:22.050 --> 30:23.449
Not really.

30:23.480 --> 30:26.119
Everything's "classic" this,
"blue ribbon" that.

30:26.150 --> 30:27.117
I can't keep track.

30:27.150 --> 30:30.449
How about Ezequiel Nadal,
21, delivery driver?

30:30.490 --> 30:34.028
Do I look like a guy that deals
with errand boys?

30:34.060 --> 30:37.052
All right, then we'd like to see
the Customs paperwork

30:37.100 --> 30:38.920
filed this past month.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.392
Preferably
the 7501 forms.

30:40.430 --> 30:42.933
Yeah, I know the form numbers,
but no, you can't.

30:42.970 --> 30:44.232
Not without a warrant.

30:44.270 --> 30:47.103
AL: I thought you ran
a clean business here.

30:47.140 --> 30:49.279
I loved One-Eyed Danny
the drug dealer.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.547
Hey, Al?

30:59.250 --> 31:01.218
That guy was at
Heritage Classics.

31:01.260 --> 31:04.024
Hey.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.482
Hey! Police!

31:30.650 --> 31:32.686
Al, keep him busy.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.914
I got an idea.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.241
Shotgun.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.386
MURRAY:
Mr. Mullin, ballistics from
your gun match Mr. Castigan.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.092
That and your
previous convictions
for attempted murder

32:14.130 --> 32:17.293
mean you're going away forever,
unless you help us out.

32:17.330 --> 32:18.592
What I'm trying to tell you is

32:18.630 --> 32:20.063
this is a business.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.738
Just cars and such.

32:21.770 --> 32:23.590
Maybe it's a little shady,

32:23.640 --> 32:25.369
but I didn't have
anybody killed.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.970
Not Castigan, not anybody!

32:28.010 --> 32:30.331
My colleague tells me
Mullin's already gave you up,

32:30.380 --> 32:32.200
said the whole thing was your
idea, your plan

32:32.250 --> 32:33.706
to wipe the slate clean.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.513
Why did you kill Ezequiel Nadal?

32:35.550 --> 32:37.211
I didn't.
You're trying to tell us...

32:37.250 --> 32:38.239
I didn't kill the kid!

32:38.290 --> 32:40.212
Castigan called me up!
He was worried

32:40.250 --> 32:42.616
what he was gonna say
when the cops showed up.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.218
So I sent Mullin over there

32:44.260 --> 32:45.659
to talk to him,
that's it!

32:45.690 --> 32:50.389
He's the one with the gun,
the record.

32:50.430 --> 32:52.193
I'm just a businessman.

32:52.230 --> 32:53.299
This is all Krinkowski.

32:53.330 --> 32:57.767
He was afraid someone would find
out about the cars.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.132
Told me to kill Castigan
and clean out his records.

33:00.170 --> 33:01.205
And Ezequiel?

33:01.240 --> 33:02.172
I'm telling you,

33:02.210 --> 33:04.201
why would I kill a kid
who delivered cars?

33:04.250 --> 33:06.206
He picked up the keys
from the girl.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.138
He had no idea
what was going on.

33:12.690 --> 33:15.158
Both of these guys are lying
through their teeth,

33:15.190 --> 33:16.657
trying to pin it
on the other one.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.749
Webster confirmed
what Mullin said
about the ballistics.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.724
He used a nine-millimeter
on Castigan.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.296
The gun is registered
to him.

33:22.330 --> 33:24.218
Problem is, Ezequiel was
shot with a .22.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.226
We pulled a dozen guns out
of Krinkowski's garage.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.238
Any one of these guys
could have done it.

33:28.270 --> 33:29.635
They didn't kill Ezequiel.

33:29.670 --> 33:32.434
We broke an international
auto fraud ring and caught

33:32.470 --> 33:34.370
Nick Castigan's killer,
and I'm thinking,

33:34.410 --> 33:35.707
with enough pressure,

33:35.740 --> 33:37.674
we _can make 'em for
EzeqUIel's murder as well.

33:37.710 --> 33:39.041
It was a good day, Carrie.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.047
I'm telling you

33:40.080 --> 33:41.570
we're missing something.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.269
Now I want to go
into that

33:43.320 --> 33:46.448
list of buyers again, see if one
of them has a registered .22.

33:46.490 --> 33:49.311
Please, I got people from the
City Council calling me,

33:49.360 --> 33:51.578
diplomats from
the State Department.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.552
It's like half the traders
on Wall Street

33:53.590 --> 33:55.251
bought one of those cars.
We're done.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.450
I can't go to this kid's
father and tell him

33:57.500 --> 33:59.195
we have the guy who murdered
his son.

33:59.230 --> 34:00.219
I can't do that.

34:00.270 --> 34:02.397
Then I will.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.691
What's your take
on this?

34:03.740 --> 34:04.661
You're right.

34:04.710 --> 34:05.802
You have who you need.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.137
So what difference

34:08.180 --> 34:10.068
does it make if you give us
48 hours

34:10.110 --> 34:11.304
to rework the list?

34:12.610 --> 34:14.714
Fine, stay on it.

34:14.750 --> 34:17.617
But just so we're clear,
this is serious business.

34:17.650 --> 34:19.083
The Swiss embassy's requesting

34:19.120 --> 34:21.611
a letter of apology
from the NYPD.

34:21.660 --> 34:24.652
VVhat
Why? Because they can.

34:24.690 --> 34:26.385
You got 48 hours. Go.

34:27.660 --> 34:31.096
Hi. I don't know
if you need this,

34:31.130 --> 34:33.098
but here's my report
on Ezequiel Nadal.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.199
Anything new?

34:34.240 --> 34:35.867
Not much.
Except I may have figured out

34:35.900 --> 34:38.539
where he was planning
on spending the rest
of his life.

34:38.570 --> 34:39.730
Someplace hot.

34:39.770 --> 34:41.306
AL:
What makes you
say that?

34:41.340 --> 34:43.706
There were some odd things
in his blood work.

34:43.740 --> 34:44.775
Traces of vaccines;

34:44.810 --> 34:48.177
unique combination of
chloroquine and proguanil.

34:48.220 --> 34:49.517
You need those to travel

34:49.550 --> 34:52.280
to tropical countries like
India, South America.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.415
Do you recognize
that young man?

34:55.460 --> 34:58.384
No, not at all.

35:01.530 --> 35:04.124
You look beautiful.

35:05.430 --> 35:08.137
And Celine, have a
wonderful day, all right?

35:08.170 --> 35:11.094
EMMINGER:
I'll follow you out
in a minute.
All right.

35:13.770 --> 35:15.306
Emminger's oldest daughter.

35:16.840 --> 35:17.807
Listen, have it back...

35:17.840 --> 35:19.671
Eliot.
Yes? Ugh.

35:19.710 --> 35:20.904
You got a minute?

35:20.950 --> 35:22.349
Maybe.

35:22.380 --> 35:23.540
So, that personal apology?

35:23.580 --> 35:25.582
I would like
to deliver it in person.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.144
Really?

35:27.190 --> 35:29.283
Who exactly do you want
to apologizing to?

35:29.320 --> 35:30.412
Lukas Emminger.

35:30.460 --> 35:33.258
Yeah. That's what
I was afraid of.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.757
I'd really hate to miss him.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.427
He leaves
the country tomorrow.

35:36.460 --> 35:40.499
You know, I was really starting
to love this job.

35:40.530 --> 35:41.667
Do me a favor?

35:41.700 --> 35:43.429
Be discreet?

35:43.470 --> 35:45.199
Be careful.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.400
Okay.

35:50.410 --> 35:51.775
I'll get Lukas.

35:51.810 --> 35:53.846
I'm sorry I can't offer you
a place to sit,

35:53.880 --> 35:55.313
but we're all packed
and leaving.

35:55.350 --> 35:56.442
It's our last night here.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.617
What's going on,
detectives?

35:57.650 --> 36:00.448
Just wanted to let you know
we found the boy's killer

36:00.490 --> 36:02.458
and to apologize if
we caused you any concern.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.788
Not at all.
We all have our jobs to do.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.229
I was just wondering--
before you leave--

36:06.260 --> 36:09.752
why didn't you tell us
your daughter was in love
with Ezequiel Nadal?

36:12.770 --> 36:14.738
This is her picture, right?

36:14.770 --> 36:17.193
Yes. What is this?

36:17.240 --> 36:18.639
AL:
We believe your
daughter met Ezequiel

36:18.670 --> 36:19.637
when he delivered

36:19.670 --> 36:21.535
a car to your husband.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.707
They went together
to deliver other cars.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.344
Ezequiel posted that
on his Instagram.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.678
I don't understand why
my daughter's relationship

36:27.710 --> 36:29.314
with this young man is
police business.

36:29.350 --> 36:30.840
I want to talk
to your daughter now.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.643
Absolutely not.

36:33.820 --> 36:35.185
Hey, Celine.

36:35.890 --> 36:37.983
EMMINGER:
Celine!

36:38.020 --> 36:39.749
I don't have anything to hide.

36:39.790 --> 36:41.223
You were running away

36:41.260 --> 36:43.626
together, weren't you?

36:43.660 --> 36:44.922
To India, Goa.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.995
No! I forbid you

36:47.030 --> 36:48.634
to answer any questions.

36:48.670 --> 36:49.739
Yes.

36:52.010 --> 36:54.001
We met when he came
with the cars.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.679
And we kept it a secret
because we knew.

36:58.550 --> 37:02.646
We wanted to be different people
in a different place.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.739
We were supposed
to leave that night.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.917
Ezequiel said he was getting
some money

37:06.950 --> 37:08.656
and he would meet me
on the corner.

37:08.690 --> 37:10.317
So I packed a bag.

37:10.360 --> 37:13.523
I went, I waited.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.448
Never came.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.252
EMMINGER:
Celine, you told me,

37:17.300 --> 37:19.598
you promised me
that you had broken
it off with him.

37:19.630 --> 37:21.666
We were in love.

37:21.700 --> 37:22.769
God.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.869
I don't understand.

37:23.900 --> 37:25.128
Why are you here?

37:25.170 --> 37:29.436
We found this text message in
Ezequiel's cell phone records.

37:29.480 --> 37:33.007
"Meet me at the corner
of Avenue C and 14th."

37:33.050 --> 37:35.974
Did you send
that text?

37:36.020 --> 37:37.544
No.

37:37.580 --> 37:38.945
Ezequiel was killed
at that address.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.686
CARRIE:
It's from a burner phone.

37:41.720 --> 37:42.948
Untraceable.

37:42.990 --> 37:45.026
But you know the
number, don't you?

37:45.060 --> 37:48.621
_ It's mine.
EzeqUIel got us a phone,

37:48.660 --> 37:50.594
but I-I didn't send
that message.

37:50.630 --> 37:53.667
No, no, no, this could not be
my daughter's cell phone number.

37:53.700 --> 37:54.837
GISELE:
Stop lying.

37:54.870 --> 37:57.737
You must stop lying, Lukas.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.533
Mama?
I'm so sorry.

37:59.570 --> 38:01.003
Gisele, stop.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.007
No.
Don't.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.439
The phone...

38:03.480 --> 38:04.674
I can fix this.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.348
...was not a surprise.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.719
I found it in your room,
and I showed it to Lukas.

38:12.750 --> 38:15.583
We-We read the texts.

38:15.620 --> 38:18.589
Stop now!

38:18.630 --> 38:22.327
You knew it was in her bag.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.622
You did.

38:23.660 --> 38:27.460
Did...

38:27.500 --> 38:29.798
Did you kill Ezequiel?

38:39.910 --> 38:42.515
I was just trying
to protect my family.

38:42.550 --> 38:44.347
I spoke with both of them.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.688
I-I offered him money
to go away.

38:46.720 --> 38:47.709
He wouldn't take it.

38:47.750 --> 38:50.014
Celine promised me
that she had broken it off,

38:50.060 --> 38:51.925
and then I read the text

38:51.960 --> 38:55.657
and I saw their plan.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.498
I was about to lose my daughter
forever. I had just...

38:58.530 --> 39:00.327
GISELE:
No! Celine!

39:03.700 --> 39:04.906
Celine?

39:06.070 --> 39:07.901
I don't want to be here.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.828
I want you to put
the knife down, honey, okay?

39:09.880 --> 39:12.041
I don't want to be here anymore.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.479
I know, but I need you
to put the knife down.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.649
GISELE: Don't...
Celine.

39:15.680 --> 39:16.817
You don't get to talk!

39:18.620 --> 39:19.985
Celine, look me.

39:20.020 --> 39:21.954
Look at me.
Look at me.

39:21.990 --> 39:23.958
Celine, look at me.

39:23.990 --> 39:27.653
I know you loved Ezequiel.

39:27.690 --> 39:30.523
I know you loved him so much.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.688
And he loved you, didn't he?

39:33.730 --> 39:35.493
Of course.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.064
Of course he did.

39:37.100 --> 39:41.059
Then how can you imagine
hurting yourself like this?

39:42.580 --> 39:46.175
He wouldn't want you
to die, right?

39:46.210 --> 39:50.419
He'd want you to live
and go to India and be free

39:50.450 --> 39:51.712
and swim in the ocean.

39:51.750 --> 39:53.615
But we can't!

39:53.650 --> 39:54.719
Yes, you can, you can.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.715
Celine, look at me.

39:57.620 --> 40:01.124
CARRIE: You have your whole
life ahead of you.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.549
Don't make his death
for nothing.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.626
You can live life
for both of you, okay?

40:06.670 --> 40:07.694
You can.

40:07.730 --> 40:09.937
Okay, come here.
Give me the knife.

40:11.510 --> 40:12.738
Give me the knife.

40:16.740 --> 40:19.447
Lukas Emminger,
you're under arrest

40:19.480 --> 40:22.472
for the murder
of Ezequiel Nadal.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.010
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:24.050 --> 40:25.813
Don't bother!

40:25.850 --> 40:27.943
Perhaps you've never heard
of diplomatic immunity?

40:27.990 --> 40:29.059
Let's go.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.151
Good job today.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.519
All for nothing,
though, right?

40:38.570 --> 40:40.128
Does that creep
really get immunity?

40:40.170 --> 40:42.468
Or make your friends
at City Hall happy--

40:42.500 --> 40:43.797
no diplomatic scandal.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.001
Funny thing about that.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.838
Did you know diplomatic immunity
is a privilege

40:48.880 --> 40:50.905
that can be waived
by the visiting ambassador?

40:52.780 --> 40:54.145
Well,
after a lovely talk with me,

40:54.180 --> 40:55.738
turns out the Swiss
see the value

40:55.780 --> 40:57.919
in having a friend
in Major Crimes.

40:57.950 --> 41:00.919
A point I believe I was trying
to make with you earlier.

41:02.520 --> 41:03.316
Immunity's waived.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.021
Emminger stands trial
for murder.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.828
You just saying good

41:17.870 --> 41:19.167
It's tough.

41:19.210 --> 41:22.509
You know, even when
you know the truth, still...

41:22.540 --> 41:23.939
hate to see her go.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.505
I'm sure she'll find
a good home.

41:26.550 --> 41:28.245
Yeah.

41:28.280 --> 41:30.646
Let me ask you something.
You didn't really have

41:30.680 --> 41:32.216
a Dodge Swinger
in high school, right?

41:32.250 --> 41:34.684
Sure. Why not?

41:34.720 --> 41:37.780
I don't know, just...

41:37.820 --> 41:39.788
not how I imagined you,
I guess.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.695
Well, people will surprise you.

41:43.830 --> 41:45.161
Jay.

41:46.830 --> 41:48.695
I had a '65 Shelby Mustang.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.903
428 under the hood,
with a top-loading four-speed

41:51.940 --> 41:54.101
and a Traction-Lok
rear end I built myself.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.649
_ Ran it into a_ tree
night of my senior prom.

41:58.680 --> 42:01.979
Still... that's more like it.

42:04.020 --> 42:05.840
Damn.

42:06.750 --> 42:08.081
CARRIE:
Hello.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.815
Hey.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.748
You want to _take it
for a spin

42:11.790 --> 42:13.189
before they haul it away?

42:13.230 --> 42:15.289
No, no, no.
Not my style.

42:15.330 --> 42:16.695
Besides, I think
the Italians made

42:16.730 --> 42:17.992
a big mistake with the Ferrari.

42:18.030 --> 42:18.997
Is that right?

42:19.030 --> 42:19.997
No back seat.

42:20.030 --> 42:21.190
I don't think that's important.

42:21.230 --> 42:23.095
August 14, 2000,

42:23.140 --> 42:24.835
South shore, Lake Onondaga?

42:24.870 --> 42:26.235
You were driving a 19...

42:26.270 --> 42:29.273
...1996 Chevy Impala SS.

42:29.310 --> 42:30.834
Very usable back seat.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.246
Very usable.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.177
I'm headed to the subway.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.847
You want to walk with me?

42:37.880 --> 42:39.279
Yeah.

42:41.720 --> 42:44.109
Listen, about those
shiny, shiny shoes
of yours.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.957
I like them.

42:45.990 --> 42:47.025
Forget it.

42:47.060 --> 42:48.254
I gave 'em to the
Salvation Army.

42:48.290 --> 42:49.257
Al, why?!

42:49.300 --> 42:50.324
That's okay.

42:50.360 --> 42:51.691
They were Gucci
knockoffs, anyway.
