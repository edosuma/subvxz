WEBVTT

00:07.907 --> 00:11.911
I can't believe
how cold it is in here.

00:11.911 --> 00:13.913
Niles, the climate
control is on.

00:13.913 --> 00:15.415
It's perfectly
comfortable.

00:15.415 --> 00:16.416
Oh, really?

00:16.416 --> 00:17.417
Touch your tongue
to the seat belt.

00:17.417 --> 00:18.918
I dare you.

00:18.918 --> 00:20.387
I'm starting to regret
I even asked you to this exhibit.

00:20.387 --> 00:21.755
I wanted to
invite Regan,

00:21.755 --> 00:24.724
but after the disaster I made
of our first date,

00:24.724 --> 00:26.593
I just felt too ashamed
to even ask.

00:26.593 --> 00:27.994
Well, you can't avoid her
forever.

00:27.994 --> 00:29.996
She's your neighbor.

00:29.996 --> 00:30.997
Ask her again.

00:30.997 --> 00:32.365
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

00:32.365 --> 00:33.733
She'd ask me
to stop harassing her,

00:33.733 --> 00:35.735
which means I'd have to spend
the next six months

00:35.735 --> 00:37.737
riding in the service elevator
with Guillermo

00:37.737 --> 00:39.539
and his three-legged cat.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.141
How is little Wobbles?

00:41.141 --> 00:42.976
Fine.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.712
I see what you're
doing, Niles!

00:45.712 --> 00:46.546
Listen, if you're so cold,

00:46.546 --> 00:48.481
there is a scarf
in the glove compartment.

00:48.481 --> 00:49.883
Oh, really? I thought
that's where you kept

00:49.883 --> 00:51.885
the butter and the eggs.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.887
Well, now it's
burning up in here!

00:53.887 --> 00:55.889
Oh... I'm just going to
take this thing off.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.390
Are you insane?
No.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.858
Well, at least wait
until we've stopped.

00:58.858 --> 00:59.759
You're going
to get us killed!

00:59.759 --> 01:00.994
Take the wheel.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.862
I'll take the wheel, but...
Frasier, stop.

01:02.862 --> 01:04.263
No. It's almost off.

01:04.263 --> 01:06.533
No, I mean brake! Brake!

01:10.937 --> 01:12.405
Are you all right?

01:12.405 --> 01:13.907
Yes.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.910
Thank heaven your
fist softened

01:16.910 --> 01:19.412
the blow of
the airbag.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.752
Hurt your nose?

01:28.154 --> 01:29.689
Yes.

01:29.689 --> 01:30.957
That's what I figured.

01:30.957 --> 01:32.325
Right when you
came in, I said,

01:32.325 --> 01:34.594
"That guy hurt
his nose."

01:34.594 --> 01:37.630
So how did you,
uh, you know...?

01:37.630 --> 01:39.199
Excuse me.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.703
Yes, hello, this is, uh,
Dr. Frasier Crane here.

01:43.703 --> 01:45.205
I was just wondering...

01:45.205 --> 01:47.540
I filled out my paperwork
about half an hour ago.

01:47.540 --> 01:48.341
They'll call you.

01:48.341 --> 01:50.210
We're seeing people
in order of importance.

01:50.210 --> 01:53.413
Oh, really? Well, you know,
I do have my own radio show.

01:53.413 --> 01:56.082
The importance of the injury.

01:56.082 --> 01:57.484
Yes, of course.

01:58.017 --> 02:00.954
Do you know-- are there
any plastic surgeons on call?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.455
Oh, Niles, that's not necessary.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.323
You can't be
too careful.

02:03.323 --> 02:04.324
It could be broken.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.859
Don't worry-- the best
plastic surgeons in town

02:05.859 --> 02:07.660
have their offices here:
Dr. Rabb,

02:07.660 --> 02:09.027
Dr. Karnofsky
and Dr. Burke.

02:09.027 --> 02:11.965
Karnofsky? Mel Karnofsky?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.233
That's right.

02:15.101 --> 02:16.603
Maris' plastic surgeon.

02:16.603 --> 02:19.139
Oh.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.573
Would you believe
that charlatan

02:20.573 --> 02:23.076
is still picking my pocket
a year after my divorce?

02:23.076 --> 02:24.043
Good Lord, for what?

02:24.043 --> 02:26.579
Oh, for Maris'
Botox injections.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.314
You know, they use

02:28.314 --> 02:31.084
those botulinum toxins
and put it in the forehead,

02:31.084 --> 02:33.086
and it deadens the muscles
and takes away the wrinkles.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.054
I gave it to her as a gift
one year for our anniversary.

02:35.054 --> 02:36.489
Oh, yes, probably
your tenth.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.926
That's toxins,
isn't it?

02:39.926 --> 02:42.328
Anyway, Karnofsky
keeps billing me

02:42.328 --> 02:43.763
for her follow-up
injections.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.699
Good Lord. So, you're
divorced, huh?

02:49.702 --> 02:50.703
Yes.

02:50.703 --> 02:52.572
Me, too. I'm Phil.
Hello.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.474
14 years together.

02:54.474 --> 02:55.975
Came home one day and...

02:55.975 --> 02:58.244
Oh, hell, I probably shouldn't
even talk about it.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.013
Okay.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.516
You know, Niles,

03:03.516 --> 03:04.484
seeing as how
we're here,

03:04.484 --> 03:06.019
why don't you go
find this Karnofsky

03:06.019 --> 03:07.287
and straighten the
whole thing out?

03:07.287 --> 03:08.955
No, no, I can't
leave you here injured.

03:08.955 --> 03:10.757
That's all right,
Niles, I'll be fine.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.158
If you're sure...

03:12.158 --> 03:14.427
I may just pay
Dr. Karnofsky a visit.

03:14.427 --> 03:15.228
You know, it really
is outrageous

03:15.228 --> 03:16.696
what these scalpel
jockeys get away with--

03:16.696 --> 03:17.730
convincing women
like Maris

03:17.730 --> 03:19.232
to spend fortunes
on their exterior

03:19.232 --> 03:20.233
when frankly,
what they need

03:20.233 --> 03:22.001
is to take a good look
at the woman inside.

03:22.001 --> 03:23.836
Right. Well, she did have
one chemical peel

03:23.836 --> 03:26.306
where you could see
her kidneys for a while.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.208
That's very funny.
Off you go.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.243
Good luck, Niles.
Thank you.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.644
(sighing)

03:33.000 --> 03:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:43.623 --> 03:45.058
Not a pretty woman,

03:45.058 --> 03:47.227
my wife, but
when she danced,

03:47.227 --> 03:48.995
you couldn't keep
your eyes off her.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.797
You know, actually,
I'm feeling a lot better.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.066
Good-bye.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.169
Frasier Crane.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.870
Frasier Crane,
we're ready to see you.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.173
That's me.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.350
Ah, Dr. Karnofsky,

04:10.350 --> 04:11.417
I see you've
finally decided

04:11.417 --> 04:12.285
to make time for me.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.152
Sorry. I'm from Records.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.455
I was told to bring over
Maris Crane's files.

04:17.589 --> 04:18.791
That's this year.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.030
Dr. Crane?
NILES: Yes.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.499
I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

04:26.499 --> 04:27.934
Melinda Karnofsky.

04:29.902 --> 04:32.405
Oh, uh... yes, of course.
Niles Crane.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.339
Uh...

04:33.339 --> 04:34.274
about this
billing issue...

04:34.274 --> 04:35.541
(clears throat)

04:35.541 --> 04:37.577
Oh. Oh, my God,
this box is filthy.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.213
Uh, yes. The problem is

04:40.213 --> 04:41.881
I have received

04:41.881 --> 04:44.784
three invoices
over the past six months.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.786
Yes. I'm so sorry
about that, and I...

04:46.786 --> 04:48.755
I'm... so
sorry about...

04:48.755 --> 04:50.056
(coughing):
all this dust.

04:50.056 --> 04:50.857
Do you mind?

04:50.857 --> 04:52.625
I'll have to turn
on my hepa filter.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.360
Oh... you have
a hepa...

04:54.360 --> 04:55.795
(gasping):
You have a Svenson!

04:55.795 --> 04:57.797
Yes!

04:57.797 --> 04:59.299
They're great,
aren't they?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.767
Not to mention

05:00.767 --> 05:02.735
impossible to get
in this country.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.103
I've tried!

05:04.103 --> 05:06.172
Well, I once did a favor
for Mrs. Svenson.

05:06.172 --> 05:07.440
Oh, it's a
long story.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.275
I'm all ears.

05:09.275 --> 05:10.410
So was she.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.944
Anyway,

05:11.944 --> 05:13.313
I've spoken
to the accounting department

05:13.313 --> 05:16.316
about your bill,
and it was clearly our mistake.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.184
Please accept my apology.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.085
We'll take care of it.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.054
Oh. I-I appreciate that.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.522
Bye-bye.

05:22.522 --> 05:23.523
Thank you. Oh...

05:23.523 --> 05:26.459
Ooh, I like that print
very much.

05:26.459 --> 05:27.360
Hmm?

05:27.360 --> 05:28.661
Everything all right?

05:28.661 --> 05:31.364
I'm sorry. I just noticed
a smudge on my jacket.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.599
Well, it's barely noticeable.

05:33.599 --> 05:34.867
You're being kind.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.169
I got that print

05:36.169 --> 05:37.904
at the last museum show.

05:37.904 --> 05:40.206
Oh! I thought
you looked familiar.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.008
Uh, perhaps I've seen you there.

05:42.008 --> 05:42.742
Oh, perhaps.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.210
I go to all of the openings.

05:44.210 --> 05:46.112
I'm-I'm on the museum board.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.314
Really?

05:48.314 --> 05:49.115
Well, congratulations.

05:49.115 --> 05:50.483
All the exhibits
this year have been...

05:50.483 --> 05:51.317
(sighing)

05:51.317 --> 05:53.152
...perfection.

05:53.152 --> 05:55.288
Thank you.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.090
I, uh...

05:57.090 --> 06:00.059
I-I particularly like
the Picasso.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.994
I'm a big fan
of his-his cubist period.

06:01.994 --> 06:03.396
Oh, striking,
isn't she?

06:03.396 --> 06:05.798
Yes, I'd like to think
if she'd come in here,

06:05.798 --> 06:08.067
I could actually have
helped her.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.038
You must think
I'm terribly fussy.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.007
(wistfully):
Yes.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.844
Well, anyway, it was
very nice meeting you.

06:17.844 --> 06:18.578
Oh, likewise.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.946
(intercom buzzes)

06:19.946 --> 06:20.913
WOMAN (over intercom):
Dr. Karnofsky,

06:20.913 --> 06:22.448
Mrs. Maggarshack
has a question for you

06:22.448 --> 06:23.950
in room three.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.418
Helen Maggarshack?

06:25.418 --> 06:27.820
Oh, I really
can't say.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.556
Oh, right.
She's finally having it removed?

06:30.556 --> 06:32.158
Why did she wait?

06:32.158 --> 06:33.359
I don't know.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.667
I found '98.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.537
Uh, actually, that's
all been settled.

06:44.537 --> 06:45.338
Uh, can you tell me...

06:45.338 --> 06:48.207
do you know, is...
is that her husband?

06:48.207 --> 06:50.410
No. She's divorced.
That's her son.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.678
Really?

06:52.678 --> 06:54.247
Dr. Karnofsky's so young,

06:54.247 --> 06:57.049
she must have had him
when she was a child.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.818
Okay.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.225
Oh! Oh, is there... is
there something else?

07:06.225 --> 07:08.161
Uh... no.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.061
All right.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.397
Uh, no.

07:11.397 --> 07:14.000
Well...
MEL: Yes?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.768
Mel, uh,
I was wondering, uh...

07:15.768 --> 07:16.769
Ooh.
Oh.

07:16.769 --> 07:17.770
(chuckling)

07:17.770 --> 07:21.073
Uh, I, uh, uh...
This is a little awkward...

07:21.073 --> 07:22.842
Oh, thank you. I, uh, uh...

07:22.842 --> 07:25.711
I'm not really sure
how to ask... Uh...

07:25.711 --> 07:26.579
I think I know what it is.

07:26.579 --> 07:27.580
Uh-huh?

07:27.580 --> 07:29.482
And you've got no reason
to be nervous.

07:29.482 --> 07:30.416
Oh, really?
Yes.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.918
Just a few quick
injections,

07:31.918 --> 07:34.253
and those nasty little
wrinkles in your forehead,

07:34.253 --> 07:35.955
they'll disappear.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.057
Well, that is

07:38.057 --> 07:39.625
what you were going to ask,
isn't it?

07:39.625 --> 07:41.928
(laughing):
Yes.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.297
Well, it's a very
simple procedure,

07:44.297 --> 07:46.165
although your forehead
will be numb for a while.

07:46.165 --> 07:48.167
I can fit you
in at, uh, 4:30.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.135
Oh, good.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.670
That gives me time
to do something I need to do.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.671
Excellent.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.477
(doorbell rings)

07:57.477 --> 07:59.045
DAPHNE:
Hello, Dr. Crane.

07:59.045 --> 08:00.046
NILES:
Hello, Daphne.

08:00.046 --> 08:00.980
I was on my way home.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.849
I thought I'd see
how the patient was doing.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.584
Oh, I'm fine, thank you, Niles.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.452
You have no idea
how guilty I'm feeling.

08:06.452 --> 08:07.954
I suppose he told
you it was my fist

08:08.454 --> 08:10.790
that struck the inadvertent
yet powerful blow.

08:14.627 --> 08:15.628
So, how did things go

08:15.628 --> 08:17.630
with the nefarious
Dr. Karnofsky?

08:17.630 --> 08:18.998
Did you give him
a piece of your mind?

08:18.998 --> 08:21.367
Actually,
"he" turned out to be a "she,"

08:21.367 --> 08:23.636
and quite a reasonable "she"
at that.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.371
Really? That's
quite a turnabout.

08:25.371 --> 08:27.206
Yes, well...

08:27.206 --> 08:28.975
Dr. Crane,
don't move. Why?

08:28.975 --> 08:29.809
There's a mosquito.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.577
Where?
On your forehead.

08:31.577 --> 08:34.380
Oh, get off,
get off, get off.

08:34.380 --> 08:35.715
It's already gone.
Oh.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.717
Oh, dear, it looks
like it bit you.

08:37.717 --> 08:41.053
Oh, right. Ow!

08:43.956 --> 08:48.227
Niles, wrinkle your forehead
for me, will you?

08:53.466 --> 08:55.568
Why would I do that?

08:55.568 --> 08:58.204
Just do it.
Wrinkle your forehead.

09:03.509 --> 09:04.277
I'm not
your marionette!

09:04.277 --> 09:06.579
You got
a Botox injection!

09:06.579 --> 09:08.748
You've got a forehead full
of poison right now, don't you?

09:08.748 --> 09:11.484
I do not!

09:13.286 --> 09:14.754
Oh, that's strange.

09:14.754 --> 09:18.224
The mosquito fell right
out of the air dead.

09:20.526 --> 09:22.862
What's a Botox
injection?

09:22.862 --> 09:24.864
Oh, it's a cosmetic
procedure they use

09:24.864 --> 09:26.666
to eliminate
facial wrinkles.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.934
Oh, great, my kids are having
plastic surgery.

09:27.934 --> 09:30.303
That's a nice age to get to.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.171
I can't believe
you let Maris' witch doctor

09:32.171 --> 09:33.472
work her magic on you.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.742
Mel... is a perfectly
lovely person.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.244
In fact, I was screwing up
my courage

09:38.244 --> 09:40.246
to ask her out on a date
when she noticed

09:40.246 --> 09:42.582
this little flaw,
and I lost my nerve.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.352
Yes... and most of the feeling
in your face, as well.

09:46.352 --> 09:49.221
Dr. Crane, look.
Your picture's on the news.

09:49.221 --> 09:50.089
Turn it up, Dad,
turn it up.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.091
After checking
into the hospital

09:52.091 --> 09:53.593
with what appeared to be
minor injuries

09:53.593 --> 09:54.594
from a fender bender,

09:55.094 --> 09:58.030
radio psychiatrist Frasier Crane
died suddenly today.

09:58.030 --> 10:01.867
I'm sure I speak
for all of us here at KYOL

10:01.867 --> 10:04.337
when I say
he will be sorely missed.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.106
But this rain won't be missed,
will it, Flip?!

10:07.106 --> 10:09.175
Dear God!

10:09.175 --> 10:11.277
What the hell?
That's unbelievable!

10:11.277 --> 10:13.613
Outrageous!

10:17.917 --> 10:19.485
As it turns out,
after I left the hospital,

10:19.485 --> 10:21.887
some poor devil used
my name to jump the line

10:21.887 --> 10:24.290
and he dropped dead
of a heart attack.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.324
Oh.

10:25.324 --> 10:26.792
I must say, it does feel
a bit strange

10:26.792 --> 10:29.261
having plunged
all of Seattle--

10:29.261 --> 10:33.766
albeit temporarily--
into so much grief.

10:33.766 --> 10:35.201
I know I'll never forget
where I was

10:35.201 --> 10:38.638
when I heard you had died.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.806
I was out on
the street,

10:40.806 --> 10:43.109
and there was this crowd
watching a television

10:43.109 --> 10:44.610
through a department
store window... Mm-hmm.

10:44.610 --> 10:47.113
and before I knew
it, we were weeping

10:47.113 --> 10:48.914
and hugging each other...
That's very amusing, Roz.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.717
And then it began to rain,

10:51.717 --> 10:55.087
and I had this feeling
that all the angels were crying.

10:55.087 --> 10:56.389
Yes, all right, Roz!

10:56.389 --> 10:57.890
Hey, Roz.

10:57.890 --> 10:58.891
Fras, did
you see this?

10:58.891 --> 11:00.393
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I did.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.394
It's my obituary.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.361
They printed it?

11:02.361 --> 11:04.363
Yes, they must have picked it up
off the wire last night

11:04.363 --> 11:05.865
before the news ran
that correction.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.233
MARTIN: Jimmy gave it to
me at McGinty's.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.634
Boy, everybody
was so nice to me,

11:08.634 --> 11:11.404
buying me beers
and everything,

11:11.404 --> 11:12.204
you know, because of the shock
I went through,

11:12.204 --> 11:15.007
thinking I'd lost my son.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.308
Dad, what are you talking about?

11:16.308 --> 11:17.243
You never thought I was dead.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.679
Well, people don't have
to know that.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.380
I mean, I could
have been at home

11:21.380 --> 11:23.282
alone wondering where you were,

11:23.282 --> 11:25.718
and I get this
strange, uneasy feeling,

11:25.718 --> 11:28.788
so I turn on the TV,
and there it is...

11:28.788 --> 11:32.725
on the screen:
the face of my dead son.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.694
I was sitting
right beside you!

11:34.694 --> 11:36.128
Well, what the hell kind of
story is that? It's the truth!

11:36.128 --> 11:39.398
Well, the truth doesn't put
anything on a coaster.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.300
Well, that's something
for your scrapbook, huh?

11:41.300 --> 11:42.802
Your own obituary.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.670
Yes, well...

11:44.670 --> 11:48.941
you know, frankly, it's...
it's a little upsetting.

11:48.941 --> 11:50.810
I don't think they meant
to be insulting.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.645
You are "lovably pompous."

11:52.645 --> 11:54.513
Well, no, it's not that.

11:55.014 --> 11:57.016
Not that. It's just,
you know, seeing my life

11:57.016 --> 11:58.017
in black and white.

11:58.017 --> 12:02.354
It just all looks
a little... incomplete.

12:02.354 --> 12:03.155
What do you mean?

12:03.155 --> 12:05.424
Well, I was going to do
so much with my life.

12:05.424 --> 12:09.228
I was going to write a novel
and run for public office.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.631
I was going to do
my own translation of Freud.

12:12.631 --> 12:15.935
Well, what's stopping you?
You're not actually dead.

12:15.935 --> 12:18.304
I guess
you're right, Roz.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.706
I'm not dead, am I?

12:20.706 --> 12:21.607
You know,
maybe that's a good way

12:21.607 --> 12:22.608
of looking at this, actually.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.577
More of a-a wake-up call.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.546
Dr. Crane, I
was so relieved

12:27.546 --> 12:29.415
to hear that you
were all right.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.083
Oh, thank you.
I heard the news

12:31.083 --> 12:32.885
and I thought, "What a shame.

12:32.885 --> 12:35.154
Why, he is such a young man."

12:35.154 --> 12:36.355
That's so nice of you.
Thank you.

12:36.355 --> 12:37.723
Thank you so much.

12:37.723 --> 12:38.691
God, you know,
you're right.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.693
What am I doing
frittering away my day here

12:40.693 --> 12:41.694
in this coffee house?

12:41.694 --> 12:42.695
You know what?
I've got things to do.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.697
I've got fresh worlds
to conquer.

12:44.697 --> 12:47.199
I'm going to go out there
and grab life by the scruff.

12:47.199 --> 12:49.201
Look out, destiny, here I come.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.569
(thunder rumbling)

12:50.569 --> 12:55.407
Oh, well, it's
really coming down out there.

12:58.644 --> 12:59.912
DAPHNE: What happened
to your clothes?

12:59.912 --> 13:01.680
Did you spill something
on yourself?

13:01.680 --> 13:03.382
Oh, no, no.
I'm-I'm going jogging later.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.217
No need to be sarcastic.

13:05.217 --> 13:07.720
Just give me the clothes,
and I'll do another load.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.654
No, I'm serious, Daphne.

13:08.654 --> 13:09.722
I plan to go running

13:09.722 --> 13:11.590
just after I finish
my obituary.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.859
You see,

13:13.859 --> 13:15.194
it's a self-actualizing
exercise.

13:15.194 --> 13:18.430
You see, you write your obituary
the way you'd like it to appear

13:18.430 --> 13:19.265
years from now,
of course,

13:19.265 --> 13:21.767
and then it helps you
to focus your goals.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.770
You see, here they are--
all my hopes and dreams.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.272
These are dreams,
all right.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.774
(laughs)

13:28.774 --> 13:31.277
"Dr. Crane came
late to athletics.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.779
"He became a fixture
in the Seattle marathon,

13:33.779 --> 13:35.748
"the America's
Cup Yacht Race

13:35.748 --> 13:37.550
as well as the
Kentucky Derby."

13:37.550 --> 13:39.685
(laughing)

13:39.685 --> 13:41.053
A jockey at your size?

13:41.053 --> 13:45.024
You better start writing
an obituary for the horse.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.559
Very amusing, Daphne.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.527
I meant as a stable owner.

13:48.527 --> 13:49.962
Hey, Fras,
what'd you do,

13:49.962 --> 13:51.397
spill something
on your clothes?

13:51.397 --> 13:53.365
No, no, I'm going jogging later.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.768
Well, there's no need
to get sarcastic about it.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.736
I'm serious, Dad.

13:57.736 --> 13:58.737
I mean, I have
to start somewhere

13:58.737 --> 14:00.072
if I plan to run
a marathon.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.907
Oh! We got a new basket?

14:01.907 --> 14:04.743
Hickory Farms.

14:04.743 --> 14:06.579
Yeah, that one came
this afternoon.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.546
Dad, we agreed
we were going to send back

14:07.546 --> 14:09.515
all the condolence baskets
intact.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.950
Yeah, I know, I know...

14:10.950 --> 14:12.952
but, you know,
if a can of pecans falls out

14:12.952 --> 14:14.954
here and there,
who's going to notice?

14:14.954 --> 14:17.423
Oh, by the way,
guess who I ran into?

14:17.423 --> 14:19.658
That friend of yours
from next door, Regan.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.794
Really?
MARTIN: Yeah.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.128
You know, she was
pretty relieved

14:23.128 --> 14:24.129
to hear you weren't dead.

14:24.129 --> 14:26.498
I don't know, maybe there's
still something going on there.

14:26.498 --> 14:27.299
Oh, I don't know, Dad.

14:27.299 --> 14:28.300
I'd like to believe that,

14:28.300 --> 14:30.302
but I'm just too much
of a realist.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.738
(doorbell rings) Tell that
to the two million people a year

14:32.738 --> 14:34.707
who visit
Frasierland.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.742
(laughs)

14:36.742 --> 14:39.044
FRASIER:
It's a Web site.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.247
It teaches children
about psychiatry.

14:42.581 --> 14:43.515
Hey, Dad, I can't stay.

14:43.515 --> 14:44.516
I just realized

14:44.516 --> 14:46.485
I think I left my cell phone
here last night.

14:46.485 --> 14:48.020
Oh, yeah, I did
see it somewhere.

14:48.020 --> 14:48.988
Let's have a look.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.390
Hey, why are you
wearing running clothes?

14:51.390 --> 14:53.893
He won't tell us.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.427
DAPHNE:
Oh, here it is.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.830
It was buried back here
underneath all these baskets.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.698
Oh, Daph, look what you did!

14:59.698 --> 15:01.700
Rooting around in there,
you poked a hole

15:01.700 --> 15:05.571
right through this
Hickory Farms basket!

15:07.706 --> 15:09.041
We can't send it back now.

15:10.442 --> 15:11.277
Thank you, Daphne.

15:11.277 --> 15:12.278
FRASIER:
Niles?

15:12.278 --> 15:13.579
Yeah.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.281
Is that a bandage
sticking out of your shirt?

15:15.281 --> 15:16.615
Oh, where?

15:16.615 --> 15:17.516
Well, right there.

15:17.516 --> 15:18.450
Oh, yes.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.818
I-I cut myself shaving.

15:19.818 --> 15:23.255
What, on the back of your neck?

15:23.255 --> 15:26.258
You went to see Karnofsky again,
didn't you?

15:26.258 --> 15:27.726
Yes, I did.

15:27.726 --> 15:29.228
I... I was going
to ask her out again,

15:29.228 --> 15:32.164
but I-I got all flustered
when I... I caught her staring

15:32.164 --> 15:34.099
at this grotesque carbuncle.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.968
Carbuncle? You mean that
minuscule mole of yours?

15:35.968 --> 15:36.969
Well, to you.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.804
I-I've always been
self-conscious about it.

15:38.804 --> 15:40.673
I've made many
a hasty wine selection

15:40.673 --> 15:43.475
because I felt the sommelier
staring down...

15:43.475 --> 15:44.777
Oh, Niles, please.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.778
Why don't you just
knock this off?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.047
Isn't it time you just
asked the woman out?

15:48.047 --> 15:51.183
Frasier, I-I'm-I'm just waiting
until the moment's right.

15:51.183 --> 15:52.351
Like you did with Daphne?

15:52.351 --> 15:55.187
Oh, Niles,
I am sorry.

15:55.187 --> 15:56.055
It's just that...

15:56.055 --> 15:57.389
I'd like to see you do this

15:57.389 --> 15:59.725
while I can still pick you
out of a crowd.

16:02.027 --> 16:03.329
You know, I've
got tickets

16:03.329 --> 16:04.129
for the opera tonight.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.464
Why don't you ask her
to join you?

16:05.464 --> 16:06.799
Oh, I don't know.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.833
FRASIER:
Oh, come on.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.335
Take a cue from me.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.303
I am completely
reinventing myself.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.838
You know what--
if I can learn a new language

16:12.838 --> 16:16.842
and-and climb mountains
and write a best-seller,

16:16.842 --> 16:18.344
well, then surely you can ask
this woman out.

16:18.344 --> 16:19.345
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:19.345 --> 16:20.813
I have a marathon
to train for.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.314
Oh!

16:23.248 --> 16:25.751
Are you all
right, Fras?

16:25.751 --> 16:27.753
FRASIER:
I'm fine.

16:27.753 --> 16:28.754
Wh-what happened?

16:28.754 --> 16:30.756
Well, I think he tripped
on one of these baskets.

16:30.756 --> 16:31.757
Well, did you
break anything?

16:31.757 --> 16:33.258
FRASIER:
I don't think so.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.760
Because, you know,
if you broke it,

16:34.760 --> 16:38.263
there's no point in sending
this one back, either.

16:52.911 --> 16:54.413
Oh, dear God.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.649
(chuckling):
Hey, look at you.

16:57.649 --> 16:58.984
Oh, they gave you a sweet one.

16:58.984 --> 17:01.487
All shiny,
no scuffs.

17:01.487 --> 17:05.824
Still has
that new cane smell.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.092
If you play
your cards right,

17:07.092 --> 17:08.594
I might let you take
it for a spin around the lobby,

17:08.594 --> 17:10.396
all right?

17:10.396 --> 17:11.730
So, what'd they say?

17:11.730 --> 17:12.731
Oh, just a little sprain.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.733
It's going to take
a couple of weeks.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.234
You know, I guess I'm going
to have to rethink

17:16.234 --> 17:18.537
my life's plan a bit.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.739
Oh, you're going to be doing
all this stuff?

17:20.739 --> 17:23.041
Well, of course, Dad.
Why wouldn't I?

17:23.041 --> 17:26.244
Oh, I don't know, it just seems
all so complicated.

17:26.244 --> 17:28.113
The first one you tried
was kind of a bust.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.082
Yes, all right.
Well, you know what?

17:30.082 --> 17:33.619
I've just got to scale
things back a little bit,

17:33.619 --> 17:36.922
set my sights
on more attainable goals.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.624
Well, for instance,
here.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.993
"Visit South America."

17:40.993 --> 17:43.028
That's in.

17:43.028 --> 17:46.465
"Discover the lost treasure
of the Incas."

17:48.801 --> 17:51.170
That's out.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.672
"Take up rafting."

17:53.672 --> 17:55.174
That's in.

17:55.174 --> 17:58.444
"Retrace Lewis
and Clark's route."

17:59.278 --> 18:01.280
That's out.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.782
And this
perpetual motion stuff--

18:03.782 --> 18:05.751
all this can go.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.719
(doorbell rings)

18:07.719 --> 18:09.221
Daphne!

18:09.221 --> 18:10.722
Oh, no, she's out
for the whole evening.

18:10.722 --> 18:12.024
You're going to have
to get it yourself.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.392
Oh, all right.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.393
Come on, let's see

18:14.393 --> 18:16.395
how that thing
handles the corners.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.864
Come on,
open her up!

18:18.864 --> 18:21.100
(laughing)

18:21.100 --> 18:22.401
Oh...
Oh!

18:22.401 --> 18:25.404
Frasier, I'd like you to meet
Dr. Mel Karnofsky.

18:25.404 --> 18:26.905
Well, I can't tell you
what a pleasure this is.

18:27.372 --> 18:28.173
Hello.

18:28.173 --> 18:28.974
NILES:
I believe you have

18:28.974 --> 18:29.975
some opera tickets
for us?

18:29.975 --> 18:31.477
FRASIER:
Yes, I do.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.479
Oh, uh, Mel, this is
my father, Martin.

18:33.479 --> 18:34.313
MEL:
Oh, hello.

18:34.313 --> 18:35.547
Hi. How are you?
FRASIER: Here we are.

18:35.547 --> 18:37.483
Oh, thank you.
We're very grateful for this.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.486
Niles and I happen to be
such huge fans of Puccini.

18:40.486 --> 18:41.987
Speaking
of which,

18:41.987 --> 18:43.489
here's our own
little pooch-ini.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.891
Oh, well!
Oh, well!

18:45.891 --> 18:48.293
You're a darling! Yes!

18:48.794 --> 18:50.295
Oh, he's wonderful.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.296
Yes.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.132
Oh...

18:55.934 --> 18:57.936
So, where are you
two having dinner?

18:57.936 --> 18:58.937
Bel Canto.

18:58.937 --> 19:00.439
We have a table
on the terrace.

19:00.439 --> 19:01.807
The terrace?

19:01.807 --> 19:04.109
Well, I didn't know
they had a terrace.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.044
Really? Oh, well, I guess
you have to know the owner.

19:06.044 --> 19:07.813
But we'd better be going.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.548
I've pre-ordered
our chocolate soufflés,

19:09.548 --> 19:11.483
and they'll be ready
at 7:30 precisely.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.985
FRASIER: Well, off
you go, then.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.453
Just remember, Niles,

19:14.453 --> 19:15.954
nothing puts
on love handles

19:15.954 --> 19:17.956
faster than
chocolate soufflé.

19:17.956 --> 19:18.957
Oh, well, you know,

19:18.957 --> 19:21.994
no one takes them off
faster than I do.

19:23.462 --> 19:24.997
That's... that's very funny.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.499
Lovely meeting you.

19:27.499 --> 19:31.470
Well, she seems a bit much.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.905
What do you mean?

19:32.905 --> 19:34.406
Well, you know,
picking the restaurant,

19:34.406 --> 19:35.908
dining on the terrace.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.910
"You have to know the owner."

19:37.910 --> 19:39.845
Doesn't she remind you
of someone?

19:39.845 --> 19:42.648
Yeah. You.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.018
I was talking about Maris.

19:46.018 --> 19:46.885
MARTIN:
Oh, come on.

19:46.885 --> 19:48.253
Don't you think
you're overreacting

19:48.253 --> 19:49.254
a little bit?

19:49.254 --> 19:50.756
I mean, Niles
sure seems happy.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.257
Oh, I guess
you're right, Dad.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.159
Besides, I've got a lot

19:54.159 --> 19:55.093
to accomplish
this evening.

19:55.093 --> 19:57.095
I'm going to start
on my Russian language tapes.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.031
(chuckles)

19:59.031 --> 20:00.799
What? What is it, Dad?

20:00.799 --> 20:02.367
What? Nothing.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.903
What? Don't you think
I can do any of these things?

20:04.903 --> 20:07.206
No, I think you can do anything
you put your mind to, Frasier.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.640
You always have.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.142
Thank you, Dad.

20:10.142 --> 20:12.644
I just wonder about
all these projects.

20:12.644 --> 20:15.647
Well, as I said,
I am streamlining.

20:15.647 --> 20:17.649
You know, I think
what you discovered this week

20:17.649 --> 20:19.918
was that something's missing
from your life,

20:19.918 --> 20:21.787
and before you
start to fill it up

20:21.787 --> 20:22.654
with everything but
the kitchen sink,

20:22.654 --> 20:25.557
I thought you ought
to just ask yourself,

20:25.557 --> 20:27.559
"What do I really want?

20:27.559 --> 20:32.831
What is really going to make
me happy... now?"

20:35.901 --> 20:39.171
Well, that's weird.

20:39.171 --> 20:42.040
I suddenly feel
like having a beer.

21:19.011 --> 21:22.014
Regan, it's me, Frasier.

21:26.518 --> 21:28.086

a'callin' ♪

21:28.086 --> 21:31.823
