00:28.478 --> 00:29.947
<i>I love doing comedy.</i>

00:29.981 --> 00:32.416
I was doing a show,
at, uh, Hermosa Beach

00:32.449 --> 00:33.885
at the Comedy and Magic Club,
right?

00:33.918 --> 00:36.353
So I leave, I leave
and I'm walking to my car

00:36.386 --> 00:37.989
and it's getting a little cold,
a little dark outside,

00:38.022 --> 00:40.424
so I'm thinking, "Let me hurry
up to get to where I need

00:40.457 --> 00:43.493
to be," so I start jogging.

00:43.527 --> 00:45.763
<i>Then this white lady with her
little jogging outfit on</i>

00:45.797 --> 00:47.899
<i>came around the corner
about 20 feet in front of me.</i>

00:47.932 --> 00:50.634
We're jogging
in the same direction now.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.472
Then she looked back.

01:00.011 --> 01:02.980
She started jogging faster.

01:03.014 --> 01:05.683
So I looked back, too.

01:11.723 --> 01:14.624
Now, I didn't see
anything back there.

01:16.928 --> 01:18.628
<i>I could've easily
passed her up,</i>

01:18.663 --> 01:20.330
but I'm thinking,
"No, I can't just leave

01:20.363 --> 01:23.000
"this defenseless lady
out here by herself.

01:23.034 --> 01:27.972
<i>Whoever back there
gonna get her."</i>

01:28.005 --> 01:30.607
So I yelled up to her,

01:30.640 --> 01:33.010
"Is that as fast
as you can run?"

01:35.046 --> 01:38.381
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, Ben Marcus.</i>

01:44.055 --> 01:46.023
See? I told you he was good.

01:46.057 --> 01:48.425
Yeah, you're right.
He had potential.

01:48.458 --> 01:50.560
- Why'd he give it up?
- We'll get to that.

01:50.594 --> 01:52.562
But right now there's
something bigger at stake.

01:52.596 --> 01:56.701
No way. Is he gonna jump off
that bridge over a dumb $8,000?

01:56.734 --> 01:58.368
That's a different movie.

01:58.401 --> 02:00.705
And eight grand was
a lot of money in 1946.

02:00.738 --> 02:02.439
That's true.
What's his deal?

02:02.472 --> 02:05.042
He's still living in the past,
living for himself.

02:05.076 --> 02:07.845
He doesn't even see
that his family's slipping away.

02:07.879 --> 02:09.714
Wow. They seem fine.

02:09.747 --> 02:11.448
I mean, they're together.
They go to church.

02:11.481 --> 02:13.651
- What's so bad?
- Looks can be deceiving,

02:13.684 --> 02:15.519
even for church families.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.989
The bottom line is
that if Ben doesn't start taking

02:18.022 --> 02:19.724
God's Word seriously,

02:19.757 --> 02:22.392
- he's gonna end up like his dad.
- Mm.

02:22.425 --> 02:24.394
Wait a minute, uh,
what happened to his dad?

02:24.427 --> 02:26.530
- Here, just watch.
- Over here?

02:26.563 --> 02:28.598
- Over there.
- Oh.

What did you spend $48 on
at Kohl's?

04:23.546 --> 04:24.982
Hannah.

04:25.016 --> 04:27.450
She needed new shoes
for her play.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.086
She got a hundred pair of shoes.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.755
She needed special ones.
She's in <i>Grease.</i>

04:30.788 --> 04:31.989
Set in the '50s.

04:32.023 --> 04:33.791
- Jack, come eat.
- 'Kay.

04:33.824 --> 04:36.861
If it's set in the '50s,
shoes were, like, 80 cents.

04:36.894 --> 04:38.663
Give her a dollar.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.597
- She can keep the change.
- Whatever.

04:40.630 --> 04:43.200
Look, her last show is on
the 12th, and we are all going.

04:43.234 --> 04:45.870
Jack, come eat.

04:45.903 --> 04:48.205
- 'Kay.
- Hey.

04:48.239 --> 04:49.674
How you doing, $48?

04:49.707 --> 04:51.208
Did I do something wrong?

04:51.242 --> 04:53.210
No. Dad's just in one
of his moods.

04:53.244 --> 04:57.148
<i>Jack, ven a comer ahora,
por favor.</i>

04:57.181 --> 04:58.149
'Kay.

04:58.182 --> 04:59.417
Okay, look, hear me out.

04:59.449 --> 05:02.920
Um, can she at least wear these
shoes with all of her clothes?

05:02.954 --> 05:05.056
You are such a <i>tonto.</i>

05:06.589 --> 05:08.059
You know, get over the shoes.

05:08.092 --> 05:09.927
Maybe help around the house
today.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.063
Like, uh, the downstairs toilet.

05:12.096 --> 05:14.165
It's making a weird sound.

05:22.206 --> 05:23.573
And,

05:23.606 --> 05:24.909
apparently,

05:24.942 --> 05:26.911
spraying water as well.

05:27.945 --> 05:28.980
All my life,

05:29.013 --> 05:31.481
I've had to fight.

05:55.072 --> 05:56.707
Good morning, Kim.

05:56.741 --> 05:59.110
Ben, hey, congrats.

05:59.143 --> 06:00.945
Oh, thanks a lot. Thank you.

06:00.978 --> 06:02.780
Three in a row.
You must be excited.

06:02.813 --> 06:05.615
Whoa. I don't know
if I could be more excited, Kim.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.820
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:09.854 --> 06:12.923
the first three-time nominee
for Best Reality Show Editing.

06:14.225 --> 06:15.659
Thank you. Thank you.

06:15.693 --> 06:16.994
Thanks a lot.
Appreciate it.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.162
- Thank you.
- What'd Jesse say about it?

06:18.195 --> 06:20.164
Yeah, Jesse, Jesse.

06:20.197 --> 06:21.265
- Yeah...
- You didn't tell her, did you?

06:21.298 --> 06:23.901
Uh, well, you know,
I kind of... I mimed it to her,

06:23.934 --> 06:25.635
- kind of.
- What is with you? And I thought about this.

06:25.669 --> 06:26.971
I want you to go
to the ceremony this year.

06:27.004 --> 06:28.839
Ceremony?
You getting married again?

06:28.873 --> 06:30.708
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm serious, Ben.

06:30.741 --> 06:32.176
It's great for the show
if you represent.

06:32.209 --> 06:33.744
- I want you to go.
- Uh, I don't think so.

06:33.778 --> 06:35.279
We did conform
the begonia footage, right?

06:35.312 --> 06:36.280
- It's on there, yeah.
- Cool.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.281
You can take the kids.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.315
Let me explain about ceremonies

06:38.349 --> 06:39.817
to you, especially award show.

06:39.850 --> 06:41.752
If they win, I'm a loser.

06:41.786 --> 06:45.056
If I win,
I'm surrounded by losers.

06:45.089 --> 06:46.757
Well, at least tell me
you'll think about it.

06:46.791 --> 06:48.359
You know what, uh,
I will think about it.

06:48.392 --> 06:49.894
- Okay.
- Hey, let me ask you a question.

06:49.927 --> 06:51.362
How do you spell "no"?

06:51.395 --> 06:54.031
Ben, look,
I just hope you reconsider.

06:54.065 --> 06:55.299
'Cause you've earned this.
You might win.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.968
Rosie might not realize she's
working with the best editor.

06:58.002 --> 06:59.770
But as your producer,
I know she is.

06:59.804 --> 07:01.105
This is so wack.

07:01.138 --> 07:02.106
I appreciate that, man.

07:02.139 --> 07:03.307
What time does Rosie get in?

07:03.340 --> 07:04.775
She's here, already. Okay?

07:04.809 --> 07:06.677
There's no time for coffee.

07:11.749 --> 07:13.717
Oh, I love this soil.

07:13.751 --> 07:15.853
I could just roll around
in this.

07:15.886 --> 07:17.121
It's not too sticky,

07:17.154 --> 07:18.122
not too sandy.

07:18.155 --> 07:19.190
It is just right.

07:19.223 --> 07:21.859
Lord, I might just go take
a bath in it.

07:21.892 --> 07:23.626
This is my little
perennial family.

07:23.661 --> 07:25.196
They're gonna go dormant on you.

07:25.229 --> 07:26.263
But don't let that worry you.

07:26.297 --> 07:28.365
Don't you worry.
Are you worried?

07:28.399 --> 07:29.366
<i>I don't think you are.</i>

07:29.400 --> 07:32.036
<i>And I'm gonna tell you
why you're not worried</i>

07:32.069 --> 07:34.171
<i>in just one minute.</i>

07:34.205 --> 07:36.373
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

07:36.407 --> 07:37.908
Thoughts?

07:37.942 --> 07:38.976
I like it.

07:39.009 --> 07:40.711
It's much better.
Great tease.

07:40.744 --> 07:43.214
Yeah, man. So, what I figured I
would do is I would contrast...

07:43.247 --> 07:45.049
I know what you're trying to do,
what you think you're doing.

07:45.082 --> 07:47.718
But you cannot contrast
perennials

07:47.751 --> 07:49.887
if you haven't shown
any annuals.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.123
- You're right. You're comp...
- No. You don't know the difference.

07:52.156 --> 07:53.157
- Rosie.
- Yeah, I do. - No.

07:53.190 --> 07:55.126
No, you don't. You do not.

07:55.159 --> 07:56.660
There's no way that you can.

07:56.694 --> 07:58.796
Now, we need to get this right.

07:58.829 --> 08:00.431
- You're so right. I don't know what I was thinking.
- Yes.

08:00.464 --> 08:03.834
So, um, let's get it right.

08:03.868 --> 08:05.436
Um...

08:05.469 --> 08:06.437
Uh...

08:06.470 --> 08:07.838
What's wrong?

08:07.872 --> 08:09.240
It's frozen.

08:09.273 --> 08:11.108
Well, then unfreeze it.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.244
It's a technical thing, Rosie.
He can't do it from here.

08:13.277 --> 08:15.246
- Texting Mickey right now.
- Take an early lunch today.

08:15.279 --> 08:17.047
Oh, yes.
Yes, let's just eat lunch.

08:17.081 --> 08:19.450
Let's buy everybody lunch.
Why don't we do that?

08:19.483 --> 08:22.319
Let's just go in the hole,
buying lunches for people.

08:22.353 --> 08:25.156
You're doing such a fine job.

08:34.832 --> 08:36.800
"You're doing such a fine job."

08:45.309 --> 08:47.811
78, seventy...

08:47.845 --> 08:50.047
107.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.083
What up, Pastor?

08:53.117 --> 08:54.451
Not a pastor yet.

08:54.485 --> 08:55.819
So, what's going on?

08:55.853 --> 08:57.354
Man,

08:57.388 --> 08:58.355
thing keeps freezing up.

08:58.389 --> 09:00.157
It's stuttering, man.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.293
So, how long
has it been freezing up?

09:02.326 --> 09:03.427
Ah, it's been, like, a week.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.728
Oh, I got you.

09:04.762 --> 09:06.463
Oh, man.

09:06.497 --> 09:09.133
One more class,
and then I get to graduate.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.001
Congratulations.
That's awesome.

09:11.035 --> 09:13.404
Got to just finish my,
uh, senior thesis.

09:13.437 --> 09:14.939
Oh. Yeah.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.473
That's gonna be a lot of fun,
probably.

09:16.507 --> 09:18.943
No, it's cool.
I actually, uh...

09:18.976 --> 09:20.311
finally picked a topic.

09:20.344 --> 09:21.845
Okay, what'd you pick?

09:21.879 --> 09:24.381
You need to read the Bible.

09:27.017 --> 09:29.820
That's what I'm calling
my paper.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.023
Oh. Yeah,
that's a good one, man.

09:33.057 --> 09:34.458
I'm focusing on men.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.994
You know, how when we study
and read the Word,

09:37.027 --> 09:39.430
it... gets into our hearts,

09:39.463 --> 09:40.431
it affects our families.

09:40.464 --> 09:41.832
It's powerful, man.

09:41.865 --> 09:42.833
Really?

09:42.866 --> 09:44.268
Yeah.

09:44.301 --> 09:46.003
<i>Really.</i>

09:46.036 --> 09:48.005
And people need to know that.
Amen.

09:48.038 --> 09:49.006
Yeah, totally.

09:49.039 --> 09:50.307
Hey, man, I'd love to, uh...

09:50.341 --> 09:52.009
I'd love to pick your brain
sometime.

09:52.042 --> 09:54.078
Pick it for...
What are you looking for?

09:54.111 --> 09:54.979
Well, I mean,
you're a Christian, you know?

09:55.012 --> 09:56.480
You're... You got a family.
You're old.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.082
No offense.
But I figure,

09:58.115 --> 10:00.084
if I'm gonna have a wife
and kids and, you know,

10:00.117 --> 10:02.186
be a pastor someday,
I could learn a lot from you.

10:02.219 --> 10:04.822
Yeah, it's, it's really not
that interesting, man,

10:04.855 --> 10:06.457
- I'll just be real with you.
- Come on. See?

10:06.490 --> 10:08.192
That's what I love about you...
you're humble.

10:08.225 --> 10:10.160
That's exactly the kind of guy
I want to learn from.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.062
Besides, I've worked here for,
like, what, over two years,

10:12.096 --> 10:13.430
and I feel like
I barely know you.

10:13.464 --> 10:16.867
- I need to process.
- Yeah, go ahead, take your time.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.202
No, bruh.

10:18.235 --> 10:20.471
I need my processor to work.
Right there.

10:20.504 --> 10:22.039
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, this. Yes.

10:22.072 --> 10:24.074
Um, this processor is dying.

10:24.108 --> 10:26.877
Um, I can get around it for now
and get you through the day,

10:26.910 --> 10:28.445
but I'm gonna have to order
the upgrade, so...

10:28.479 --> 10:30.881
All right,
I'll leave you at it, man.

10:30.914 --> 10:31.915
Yeah.

10:31.949 --> 10:33.917
Okay, let me know when it's set.

10:33.951 --> 10:35.219
Yeah.

10:56.106 --> 10:58.942
- I got to ask you guys something.
- Yep.

10:58.976 --> 11:00.978
- You know, when I wake up in the morning...
- Right.

11:01.011 --> 11:02.880
I go into the bathroom,
and I sit down

11:02.913 --> 11:04.381
when I have
to go to the bathroom.

11:04.415 --> 11:05.916
Okay.

11:05.949 --> 11:07.251
- I don't stand.
- Right.

11:07.284 --> 11:08.619
'Cause I'm tired,
a little disoriented.

11:08.653 --> 11:10.187
- Right.
- You guys do that, too?

11:10.220 --> 11:12.222
- No.
- No. Mm-mm. - Really?

11:12.256 --> 11:13.190
Yeah, that's just you, man.

11:13.223 --> 11:15.359
What else do you do
that no one else does?

11:15.392 --> 11:16.994
I like black licorice.

11:17.027 --> 11:19.296
I'll bet you nobody
likes that, either.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.231
Are you just saying that
'cause I'm here?

11:21.265 --> 11:22.266
No.

11:23.467 --> 11:25.135
- That's funny.
- He's a funny guy.

11:25.169 --> 11:27.037
- Yeah.
- I always said you were a funny guy.

11:27.071 --> 11:28.372
- Yeah.
- You had potential.

11:28.405 --> 11:29.873
- Yep.
- Yeah, man,

11:29.907 --> 11:31.175
that-that ship's
kind of sailed, man.

11:31.208 --> 11:33.110
I'm not really...
it's not something

11:33.143 --> 11:35.612
- I could do right now.
- It's your dad, isn't it?

11:35.646 --> 11:37.448
You want to be a comic,
be a comic.

11:37.481 --> 11:39.216
- You're young.
- So, what,

11:39.249 --> 11:41.552
at this point in my life,
I'm gonna start back touring

11:41.585 --> 11:43.420
and doing comedy in the clubs
and all that?

11:43.454 --> 11:45.489
- There's no way, man. I got a family.
- Hey, speaking of comedy,

11:45.522 --> 11:47.624
right, my brother Tracy
sends me a video.

11:47.659 --> 11:49.593
Hilarious.
It's a guy,

11:49.626 --> 11:51.995
four deep-dish pizzas,

11:52.029 --> 11:53.564
frozen, he's juggling 'em.

11:53.597 --> 11:56.033
At the end... they're cooked.

11:56.066 --> 11:57.501
- What?
- Yeah. It's great.

11:57.534 --> 12:00.070
I've watched it, like, 30 times.
Like, David Blaine who?

12:00.104 --> 12:02.674
- You saw this on the YouTube or something?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:02.707 --> 12:04.041
I'm thinking of starting

12:04.074 --> 12:05.642
- my own YouTube.
- Really?

12:05.677 --> 12:07.945
- Yeah.
- Nobody's gonna watch an old man cutting hair.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.413
No, I'm not cutting hair,
you idiot.

12:09.446 --> 12:12.116
I'm, um, soap carving.
Um, carving of soap.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.984
Really? You think
there's a lot of people

12:14.017 --> 12:16.053
that would watch you
carving soap?

12:16.086 --> 12:18.055
I don't know.
People watch me cutting hair.

12:18.088 --> 12:19.256
Uh-huh, um, listen.

12:19.289 --> 12:21.158
You know, it just dawned on me,

12:21.191 --> 12:24.461
I'm a black man with a bald head
at a white barbershop.

12:24.495 --> 12:26.997
So I'm gonna go.

12:31.101 --> 12:33.270
He's black?

12:35.506 --> 12:37.608
Brought you a carnation, Mom.

12:39.610 --> 12:41.979
It's a herbaceous perennial.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.449
If you do it right,

12:45.482 --> 12:49.086
it has a three-,
sometimes four-week vase life.

12:52.556 --> 12:54.391
I'm trying, Mom.

12:55.993 --> 12:57.995
I am trying.

13:04.635 --> 13:06.537
<i>"You discover the rainforest,</i>

13:06.570 --> 13:09.674
"you hike glaciers
of ancient blue-violet ice,

13:09.707 --> 13:12.309
and you ride horseback
with a 'goo-cho.'"

13:12.342 --> 13:13.410
Gaucho.

13:14.478 --> 13:16.380
We're not moving to Argentina.

13:16.413 --> 13:18.015
Again, why not?

13:18.048 --> 13:20.652
Look, Ben, I'm trying
to be understanding, okay?

13:20.685 --> 13:24.488
But in the middle of
this midlife crisis, can you...

13:24.521 --> 13:27.624
I don't know...
help out around the house?

13:27.659 --> 13:29.059
You know...

13:29.092 --> 13:31.161
uh, fix the toilet?

13:31.195 --> 13:32.429
I hate that toilet.

13:32.463 --> 13:34.431
Forget the toilet, okay?

13:34.465 --> 13:36.567
But don't forget Hannah's play.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.434
Or your son Jack,

13:37.468 --> 13:39.336
who needs help
with his math homework.

13:39.369 --> 13:41.071
You know,
his teacher e-mailed us.

13:41.104 --> 13:43.440
He's doing it right now...
why don't you go help him?

13:44.641 --> 13:46.143
I'll fix the toilet.

13:46.176 --> 13:48.178
Ben, please...

13:48.212 --> 13:50.214
please snap out of this.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.549
Okay.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.688
Let's do some math.

13:56.721 --> 13:58.288
I am your tutor.

13:58.322 --> 14:00.524
- Let's do this.
- I'm almost done.

14:01.659 --> 14:02.760
Son...

14:02.794 --> 14:04.796
you're watching a video.

14:04.829 --> 14:06.731
- I know.
- That's not math.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.465
We're doing fractions.

14:08.499 --> 14:11.101
This guy has 87,000 views
on this video.

14:11.134 --> 14:13.103
I rounded it up to 90.

14:13.136 --> 14:15.639
He posted it three days ago,
which means he gets

14:15.673 --> 14:19.042
30,000 views a day,
because one-third of 90 is 30.

14:19.076 --> 14:21.612
This other video,
he posted seven days ago.

14:21.645 --> 14:25.115
It has 1.4 million views,
which means he gets

14:25.148 --> 14:26.751
200,000 views a day,
because one-seventh

14:26.784 --> 14:29.152
of 1.4 million is 200,000.

14:30.420 --> 14:32.122
Look, you know...

14:32.155 --> 14:34.424
your mom said you needed
some help with math, but...

14:34.458 --> 14:36.627
If I finish,
can you teach me how to edit?

14:36.661 --> 14:38.328
Yeah, may... uh, maybe someday,

14:38.362 --> 14:40.197
maybe someday.

14:40.230 --> 14:44.301
So, when you say
1.4 million views,

14:44.334 --> 14:46.303
does that mean
1.4 million humans

14:46.336 --> 14:48.305
have actually watched
this video?

14:48.338 --> 14:50.574
- That's a lot.
- That's nothing.

14:50.607 --> 14:52.476
This one has seven million.

14:52.509 --> 14:55.379
Seven million people want
to watch this dude's videos?

14:55.412 --> 14:57.147
What's so special about him?

14:57.180 --> 14:59.416
He talks while
he plays <i>Minecraft.</i>

14:59.449 --> 15:01.285
And seven million people
want to watch?

15:01.318 --> 15:02.720
Yeah. I guess.

15:02.754 --> 15:05.622
Who wants to watch somebody else
play a video game?

15:05.657 --> 15:07.692
Everyone, Dad.
He's funny.

15:07.725 --> 15:10.494
I mean, he has to be...
he's a millionaire.

15:10.527 --> 15:12.362
Wha...? A millionaire?

15:12.396 --> 15:13.731
W-Well, how?

15:13.765 --> 15:15.232
UTOO pays him.

15:15.265 --> 15:17.702
UTOO pays this dude
millions of dollars

15:17.735 --> 15:21.673
so he can make a video
of himself playing video games?

15:21.706 --> 15:23.440
Yes?

15:23.473 --> 15:24.842
Wh-Wh-Who... Wha-wha-wha...

15:24.876 --> 15:26.577
uh, what?!

15:26.610 --> 15:29.279
This is what I love
about lilies.

15:29.313 --> 15:31.615
They are so "pottable"...
that means

15:31.648 --> 15:33.718
you could put them
in little pots.

15:33.751 --> 15:36.320
Don't you just love all these
little hints I'm giving you?

15:36.353 --> 15:37.722
Yes, you do.

15:37.755 --> 15:39.556
<i>This is</i> Rosie's Roses,

15:39.590 --> 15:43.627
<i>and you keep planting,
and you keep loving, okay?</i>

15:43.661 --> 15:45.763
Boom.

15:45.797 --> 15:48.398
I love it.
Maybe our best episode ever.

15:48.432 --> 15:50.634
I think it is a piece of junk.

15:50.668 --> 15:53.503
It is a mangled-up piece
of junk!

15:53.537 --> 15:56.674
You left out the whole section
of my spring tulips!

15:56.708 --> 15:58.342
My tulips!

15:58.375 --> 16:01.645
You made me look like a moron,
for heaven's sakes!

16:01.679 --> 16:03.146
Here's what I was thinking.

16:03.180 --> 16:04.514
- Um...
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:04.548 --> 16:05.883
You're not supposed to think.

16:05.917 --> 16:07.384
You're supposed
to push those buttons.

16:07.417 --> 16:09.252
Is that your picture
up on the wall?

16:09.286 --> 16:10.487
I don't think so.
Is that you

16:10.520 --> 16:12.289
in the poster?
No, it's not.

16:12.322 --> 16:14.759
Are those your roses?
I don't think they are.

16:14.792 --> 16:16.426
You're supposed to push
the buttons.

16:16.460 --> 16:19.296
Now you get to start this thing
all over and get it right!

16:19.329 --> 16:22.199
Yes. Absolutely.
Get it right.

16:24.334 --> 16:26.536
I'll talk to her.

17:21.859 --> 17:23.695
What if I just...?

17:25.328 --> 17:27.597
Let's do this.
I'm a grown man.

17:30.367 --> 17:31.401
So, check it.

17:31.435 --> 17:33.370
Uh, my name is Ben, right?

17:33.403 --> 17:35.472
And this is my very first video.

17:35.505 --> 17:37.675
Um, okay, so, uh...

17:37.709 --> 17:41.411
um, two guys walked
into a bar, right?

17:41.445 --> 17:43.380
There was a bump on their head,
'cause it was...

17:43.413 --> 17:44.414
it was a pretty heavy...

17:44.448 --> 17:45.549
No, no.

17:45.582 --> 17:46.918
Uh...

17:48.986 --> 17:51.488
Oh, I got two atheist friends.
Every time I'm around them,

17:51.521 --> 17:54.926
I sneeze just to see
what they're gonna say.

17:56.526 --> 17:58.628
<i>So, growing up,
I went to private school.</i>

17:58.663 --> 18:00.397
<i>Uh, but I probably
shouldn't tell you that,</i>

18:00.430 --> 18:01.899
<i>'cause it was private.</i>

18:01.933 --> 18:04.334
<i>And my wife,
she's a different race</i>

18:04.367 --> 18:05.535
than I am.

18:05.569 --> 18:07.839
Which means we have
mixed feelings.

18:07.872 --> 18:11.341
<i>Why is "abbreviation"
such a long word?</i>

18:11.374 --> 18:13.945
<i>Why is there no mirrors
in the self-checkout?</i>

18:13.978 --> 18:15.713
Can I call a white duck
a quacker?

18:15.747 --> 18:16.948
I got friends who are white.

18:16.981 --> 18:18.582
When a dog is wearing clothes,

18:18.615 --> 18:21.351
<i>is he disgusted
by the nakedness of other dogs?</i>

18:21.384 --> 18:22.519
And last,

18:22.552 --> 18:23.855
<i>I'd like to say,
I think it's okay</i>

18:23.888 --> 18:26.456
to regift a gift card
as long as there's at least

18:26.490 --> 18:27.792
a little something on it.

18:27.825 --> 18:29.026
<i>I'm Ben.</i>

18:29.060 --> 18:30.862
Thanks for watching.

18:30.895 --> 18:33.497
- Hey, man.
- Hey. What's up, bruh?

18:33.530 --> 18:35.565
Hey, I just need to, uh,
install the upgrade.

18:35.599 --> 18:37.567
If now's not a good time,
I can...

18:37.601 --> 18:38.669
Oh. No. Cool.

18:38.703 --> 18:40.071
Uh, I'm about to bounce.

18:40.104 --> 18:42.907
- Cool.
- So I am out of... oh, snap.

18:42.940 --> 18:45.042
I still got
all these logs to do.

18:45.076 --> 18:47.779
- Hey, so this held up?
- Uh, it was fine, man.

18:47.812 --> 18:49.947
Cool. Cool.
Well, this new processor

18:49.981 --> 18:51.048
is gonna make it fly.

18:51.082 --> 18:53.483
Oh. Dude,
that'll be awesome, man.

18:53.517 --> 18:56.486
If it's okay, I'd still like
to pick your brain,

18:56.520 --> 18:58.355
you know, for my thesis.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.524
- The thing you're doing, yeah, yeah.
- It blows my mind

19:00.557 --> 19:03.694
how God...
<i>the</i> God of the universe...

19:03.728 --> 19:05.462
gave us a book.

19:05.495 --> 19:07.765
Yeah, that's amazing,
gave us a book.

19:07.799 --> 19:10.500
It's like His words,
absolute authority,

19:10.534 --> 19:12.469
totally true, you know?

19:12.502 --> 19:14.437
You know what?
That should be a bumper sticker.

19:14.471 --> 19:16.774
I would put it
right on the back.

19:16.808 --> 19:18.876
It's crazy, though,
how so many guys

19:18.910 --> 19:20.711
that call themselves Christians

19:20.745 --> 19:22.713
couldn't care less
about the Bible.

19:22.747 --> 19:25.482
- That stuff is wack. I don't understand that.
- Like, I know

19:25.515 --> 19:27.551
some guys who leave their Bibles
in their car, and then they,

19:27.584 --> 19:29.452
you know,
they take it out for church,

19:29.486 --> 19:31.421
and then church is over and it
goes right into the trunk,

19:31.454 --> 19:33.490
and they don't even think about
it for the rest of the week.

19:33.523 --> 19:35.458
I can't stand those guys,
though, man.

19:35.492 --> 19:37.829
- That stuff is...
- Look, man, I'm sorry,

19:37.862 --> 19:39.596
I know I'm preaching
to the choir,

19:39.629 --> 19:40.965
but real quick, um,

19:40.998 --> 19:43.100
I have this little book
I want to give you.

19:43.134 --> 19:45.036
It's called
<i>Why We Need the Bible.</i>

19:45.069 --> 19:46.771
Think you'll really like it.

19:46.804 --> 19:49.439
Oh. All right, it's cool, man.

19:49.472 --> 19:51.075
I'll bring it in next time.
You could have it.

19:51.108 --> 19:52.810
Sure, that's-that's cool.

19:54.078 --> 19:55.913
<i>It's this one.</i>

19:55.947 --> 19:58.115
<i>Oh, he is cute.</i>

19:58.149 --> 19:59.984
Mm-hmm.
He's a junior.

20:00.017 --> 20:01.953
He's got a car and everything.

20:01.986 --> 20:04.088
- Oh, that is cool.
- Right?

20:04.121 --> 20:07.792
Yeah, he's the lead in this play
that I'm in at school.

20:07.825 --> 20:09.426
- It's called <i>Grease.</i>
- Mmm.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.560
<i>My dad,</i>

20:10.594 --> 20:14.131
he used to talk about God
all the time with my mom.

20:14.165 --> 20:17.001
I-I just thought
it would be the same with Ben.

20:17.034 --> 20:20.071
Hannah and-and Jack
are growing up so fast.

20:24.141 --> 20:29.714
I just wish he was,
you know, more involved.

20:29.747 --> 20:32.750
I feel like
I'm doing this all on my own.

20:34.618 --> 20:36.120
I'm sorry. I...

20:36.153 --> 20:38.990
I tend to eat a lot of sweets
when I'm stressed.

20:40.791 --> 20:42.459
<i>I mean, I wouldn't say</i>

20:42.492 --> 20:44.161
we're dating, but we're
not really into labels.

20:44.195 --> 20:46.063
Well, have you guys kissed yet?

20:46.097 --> 20:48.431
No, not yet.

20:48.465 --> 20:49.867
But, you know, all of us do
this kind of, like,

20:49.901 --> 20:51.601
midnight hangout thing
at Canyon Park.

20:51.635 --> 20:53.671
- You should come.
- At midnight?

20:53.704 --> 20:55.572
Mm-hmm.

20:55.605 --> 20:56.774
My parents would never let me.

20:56.807 --> 20:59.476
Your parents don't have to know.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.478
<i>I'm just saying</i>

21:01.511 --> 21:03.180
that you should have seen Tom

21:03.214 --> 21:05.615
when we first got married.

21:05.649 --> 21:07.885
Now, we weren't believers then.
And then one day,

21:07.919 --> 21:10.087
he comes in from work,
and he says,

21:10.121 --> 21:12.056
"You're not going
to believe this,

21:12.089 --> 21:15.826
but I have given my life
to the Lord."

21:15.860 --> 21:18.663
- Mmm.
- My point is

21:18.696 --> 21:22.632
God can do incredible things.

21:22.667 --> 21:23.868
Oh.

21:23.901 --> 21:25.069
That's him.
We should probably talk

21:25.102 --> 21:27.705
- about this later.
- Of course. Of course.

21:27.738 --> 21:29.472
Hey, Carol. What's up?

21:29.506 --> 21:30.841
- Hey, Ben.
- Listen,

21:30.875 --> 21:32.475
I have something
I have got to tell you guys.

21:32.509 --> 21:34.812
Wait. You know what?
Hold on.

21:37.748 --> 21:39.516
Okay.

21:39.549 --> 21:40.685
All right. So,

21:40.718 --> 21:43.220
uh, I'm just gonna come out
and say it.

21:43.254 --> 21:44.922
You're not gonna believe this.

21:47.658 --> 21:49.727
I started a UTOO page.

21:52.296 --> 21:54.131
<i>When a dog is wearing clothes,</i>

21:54.165 --> 21:57.735
<i>is he disgusted
by the nakedness of other dogs?</i>

21:57.768 --> 21:59.837
<i>Like, look at you just hanging out.</i>

21:59.870 --> 22:01.638
<i>And last, I'd like to say
I think it's okay</i>

22:01.672 --> 22:03.074
<i>to regift a gift card</i>

22:03.107 --> 22:05.542
<i>as long as there at least
a little something on it.</i>

22:05.575 --> 22:07.678
<i>I'm Ben. I appreciate you.
Thanks for watching.</i>

22:07.712 --> 22:10.247
So, yeah.
That's-that's pretty much it.

22:12.549 --> 22:14.517
This was funny.

22:14.551 --> 22:17.154
I... Did you know
he was this funny?

22:17.188 --> 22:19.690
I don't really know what to say.

22:19.724 --> 22:22.660
Jack, what you think?
I made a, um...

22:22.693 --> 22:24.762
I made a s...
I made a selfie.

22:24.795 --> 22:27.264
Yeah, that's not a selfie, Dad.

22:27.298 --> 22:28.666
It's more of a video.

22:28.699 --> 22:29.900
Okay. Video.

22:29.934 --> 22:31.634
Selfie, video,
whatever you want to call it.

22:31.669 --> 22:33.237
That's fine.
Important thing is you guys,

22:33.270 --> 22:35.906
if you want to,
you can tag along.

22:35.940 --> 22:39.176
Um, you know,
follow and like and stuff.

22:39.210 --> 22:40.643
Subscribe.

22:40.678 --> 22:42.880
Yes. That's right.
That's what it is.

22:42.913 --> 22:44.315
You could, you could,
you could subscribe.

22:44.348 --> 22:46.017
Hannah, tell your... tell
your little friend to do it.

22:46.050 --> 22:47.251
Subscribe.

22:47.284 --> 22:49.220
Jack, go ahead.
You do yours now.

22:49.253 --> 22:50.921
Yeah, subscribe now.

22:50.955 --> 22:53.257
Yes! There's number two.

23:06.170 --> 23:08.605
Begonia, begonia, begonia!

23:12.009 --> 23:16.814
Do you know
there is 1,795 different types

23:16.847 --> 23:18.816
of begonias?

23:18.849 --> 23:20.985
<i>Honey, if I gave birth
to that many,</i>

23:21.018 --> 23:23.586
that'd be a litter.

23:27.191 --> 23:30.661
...a litter.

23:57.788 --> 23:59.090
Boom. Here we go.

23:59.123 --> 24:01.192
My name is Ben, right?
In this video,

24:01.225 --> 24:03.094
we're gonna make a story up
about a woman.

24:03.127 --> 24:04.829
Not a woman. A really mean lady.

24:04.862 --> 24:07.031
A really mean monster.
Her name is, uh...

24:07.064 --> 24:08.265
is, uh...

24:08.299 --> 24:09.967
Posy.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.368
And she real mean.

24:13.304 --> 24:15.406
Is she looking at me?

24:15.439 --> 24:18.909
And then there's this really
humble, nice, amazing guy.

24:18.943 --> 24:20.411
Oh, not me. It's somebody else.

24:20.444 --> 24:22.813
And then Posy gets all mean.

24:22.847 --> 24:25.249
He wants to moonwalk
away from her sometimes.

24:25.282 --> 24:27.751
Yes, Ben, it was funny, okay?

24:27.785 --> 24:30.321
I'm just saying
that if making videos

24:30.354 --> 24:32.056
is gonna be
your new obsession...

24:32.089 --> 24:33.791
See, that's just it.
It's not an obsession.

24:33.824 --> 24:35.226
I just like doing it.

24:35.259 --> 24:37.828
That's fine, okay?
Just remember

24:37.862 --> 24:40.097
that you're a dad, okay?
And that you have a family.

24:40.131 --> 24:43.300
I go to a job I can't stand
for my family.

24:43.334 --> 24:45.302
I know. You remind me every day.

24:45.336 --> 24:47.404
You don't understand.
This is my first time

24:47.438 --> 24:49.140
in, like, 20 years

24:49.173 --> 24:50.407
I finally get to do
something I love.

24:50.441 --> 24:52.309
I get the point, Ben.

24:52.343 --> 24:54.879
But for once in your life,
have some balance.

24:54.912 --> 24:57.281
Okay? You went from...
from never thinking about it

24:57.314 --> 24:59.416
to being 24-7 on videos.

24:59.450 --> 25:01.452
Spend some time with your kids.

25:01.485 --> 25:03.187
And help around the house.

25:03.220 --> 25:05.055
You know, like that toilet!

25:05.089 --> 25:06.390
Cool. It's fine. I'm done.

25:06.423 --> 25:08.959
I'm not doing any more videos.
You win.

25:08.993 --> 25:10.794
Okay, fine. Go. Go make videos.

25:10.828 --> 25:13.230
Go. Go. Just do it all day long.
I don't care anymore.

25:13.264 --> 25:15.900
You know what your problem is,
right?

25:15.933 --> 25:18.169
That is not how you plant
multicolored vincas.

25:18.202 --> 25:20.371
Your soil mixture is a mess.

25:22.072 --> 25:25.042
<i>¡No me digas como
plantar flores!</i>

25:34.151 --> 25:36.086
Hello. My name is Ben.

25:36.120 --> 25:39.423
Today, I'm-a teach you
how to fix a toilet. Yeah.

25:39.456 --> 25:42.126
When your life is just wack,
as my life is,

25:42.159 --> 25:44.128
next thing
that can only make it lower

25:44.161 --> 25:46.030
is an opportunity

25:46.063 --> 25:47.431
to fix a toilet.

25:47.464 --> 25:49.500
Now you have to lift
this right here. The...

25:49.533 --> 25:51.502
This is called...
the white part.

25:51.535 --> 25:53.304
You may well be
slightly concerned

25:53.337 --> 25:55.873
that the water's not cold
like maybe it should be.

25:55.906 --> 25:57.875
The tuliter valve
goes down in here.

25:57.908 --> 25:59.910
As you just turn this...

26:03.447 --> 26:05.249
Don't be concerned if,
for some reason,

26:05.282 --> 26:06.917
the water turns pink.

26:06.951 --> 26:09.186
This is normal.
This-this is kind of normal.

26:14.391 --> 26:15.859
Son,

26:15.893 --> 26:17.428
that's how you fix a toilet.

26:17.461 --> 26:19.463
Cool.

26:21.799 --> 26:23.434
Is that your stomach?

26:23.467 --> 26:25.302
Nope.

26:40.050 --> 26:43.053
I am so happy.

26:44.521 --> 26:46.156
Ah.

26:46.190 --> 26:49.526
Should I make it out
to Bob's Plumbing?

27:21.992 --> 27:24.128
That speeding man right there
going down the highway

27:24.161 --> 27:25.562
<i>in a BMW.</i>

27:25.596 --> 27:27.097
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:27.131 --> 27:28.565
Uh, Steven just wants to know

27:28.599 --> 27:30.134
when you'll be done
with this episode.

27:30.167 --> 27:32.436
Oh, uh, it's almost there.

27:32.469 --> 27:34.238
Maybe, like, like, an hour.

27:34.271 --> 27:35.406
- Okay, great.
- Cool.

27:35.439 --> 27:39.310
By the way,
that video was hilarious.

27:39.343 --> 27:40.544
What video?

27:40.577 --> 27:42.313
You fixing the toilet.

27:43.514 --> 27:44.982
We all watched it out there.

27:45.015 --> 27:46.450
Never knew you were that funny.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.889
What's she talking about?

28:00.030 --> 28:01.231
<i>Hello.</i>

28:01.265 --> 28:03.334
<i>This is Ben.
Today, I'm-a teach you</i>

28:03.367 --> 28:05.602
<i>how to fix a toilet.</i>

28:21.686 --> 28:23.620
Refresh.

28:23.655 --> 28:26.523
Ah!

28:28.225 --> 28:29.893
Ooh!

28:29.927 --> 28:31.161
<i>Yo,</i>

28:31.195 --> 28:33.630
- where we at?
- 46,625.

28:33.665 --> 28:35.667
- This is crazy.
- Well, is this normal?

28:35.700 --> 28:38.902
- I have no idea.
- It is when a video goes viral.

28:38.936 --> 28:41.572
- So, you're not mad at me?
- I don't know.

28:41.605 --> 28:43.941
What's up with this name,
Selfie Dad, anyway?

28:43.974 --> 28:46.110
I was thinking maybe, like, uh,

28:46.143 --> 28:49.113
Cool, Handsome, Tall,
Hilarious Dad.

28:49.146 --> 28:50.514
I don't think it fits.

28:50.547 --> 28:52.349
Okay, so, where we at?

28:53.384 --> 28:55.953
- 50,009.
- Quick.

28:55.986 --> 28:56.887
- Like, that quick.
- Wow.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.690
It was just...
And now look where we at.

28:58.723 --> 29:00.157
Oh, snap. Okay.

29:00.190 --> 29:02.393
How many, uh,
how many prescribers we got?

29:02.426 --> 29:04.395
- They're <i>subscribers.</i>
- Okay.

29:04.428 --> 29:07.164
- How many of those do we have?
- 905.

29:07.197 --> 29:08.966
- Where's Hannah?
- 905. She's upstairs.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.268
Hannah!
Bring yourself downstairs!

29:11.301 --> 29:13.437
We having a family meeting!

29:17.541 --> 29:19.677
So, why are we having a meeting?

29:19.711 --> 29:21.412
Hey, Jack, what's the numbers?

29:21.445 --> 29:23.514
Just crossed the 90,000 mark.

29:23.547 --> 29:25.717
That's why
we're doing this meeting.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.118
What does that have to do
with us?

29:28.152 --> 29:30.688
Like, we sh... What we got to do
is we need to make more videos.

29:30.722 --> 29:31.955
"We"?

29:31.989 --> 29:33.524
Don't you want to be in them?

29:33.557 --> 29:34.659
Doing what?

29:34.692 --> 29:37.094
Like you gonna be in that play.
Like, you-you could act.

29:37.127 --> 29:38.595
- The play. What is it called again?
- <i>Grease.</i>

29:38.629 --> 29:40.063
It's called <i>Grease.</i>

29:40.097 --> 29:43.133
Oh, okay.
Anyway, Jack, where we at?

29:43.167 --> 29:45.369
- 93,134.
- Yes.

29:45.402 --> 29:47.705
You should be in charge
of our stats.

29:47.739 --> 29:49.306
Heck no. I want to edit.

29:49.339 --> 29:50.708
I edited this one.

29:50.742 --> 29:53.010
You did, too.
How'd you learn how to do that?

29:53.043 --> 29:54.645
- Oh, actually...
- And where did you get my phone from?

29:54.679 --> 29:56.113
- Oh, you...
- Whatever, dude. Yeah.

29:56.146 --> 29:57.648
- That's fine. You can edit.
- Yes!

29:57.682 --> 29:59.283
And, sweetie...

29:59.316 --> 30:01.618
I-I just want
your clothes to match.

30:01.653 --> 30:04.722
Boom! You in charge of wardrobe.
It's perfect.

30:04.756 --> 30:07.291
I love it. I don't know
if y'all can feel this.

30:07.324 --> 30:09.193
Can you feel it?

30:09.226 --> 30:12.296
The Marcuses are about
to take over UTOO.

30:14.766 --> 30:17.167
Um... the computer's over here.

30:17.201 --> 30:18.502
We should...

30:31.582 --> 30:33.217
First of all,
this is completely ridiculous.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.585
Richard's a good editor.

30:34.618 --> 30:36.453
No, he's not you,
but he'll do fine.

30:36.487 --> 30:38.255
Dude, we don't need
another editor.

30:38.288 --> 30:40.357
Apparently, we do. You came
this close to missing deadline.

30:40.390 --> 30:41.693
No, see, you don't understand.

30:41.726 --> 30:43.560
My computer crashed, like,
a hundred times.

30:43.594 --> 30:45.128
Oh, come on.

30:45.162 --> 30:46.731
Plus, she gives me,
like, a million notes.

30:46.764 --> 30:49.566
And at the end of that, she asks
me to do it all over again.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.101
Never slowed you down before.

30:51.134 --> 30:53.570
You know, you know
I get paid per episode.

30:53.604 --> 30:55.740
Bruh, you're messing
with my money.

30:55.773 --> 30:58.776
Hey, whoa, whoa. Can we have a
conversation about this, though?

30:58.810 --> 31:00.778
- Is that okay?
- I'll be right there.

31:00.812 --> 31:02.412
Look, it came from the network.

31:02.446 --> 31:04.114
What do you want me to do?

31:04.147 --> 31:05.683
Rosie's tough enough
when we're <i>on</i> schedule.

31:05.717 --> 31:07.184
Dude, this is messed up.

31:07.217 --> 31:08.686
Is it the UTOO stuff?

31:08.720 --> 31:10.822
I saw you shot a couple
of videos here in the room.

31:10.855 --> 31:12.489
Is that what's distracting you?

31:12.523 --> 31:14.726
It was, like, two videos.
It took two seconds.

31:14.759 --> 31:16.393
Sorry about that. Cue it up.

31:16.426 --> 31:17.762
Dude, this is so wack.

31:17.795 --> 31:20.264
Explain to me, what am I
supposed to do all week?

31:20.297 --> 31:22.700
Ben, I've got work to do. I...

31:22.734 --> 31:24.601
Fix a toilet.

31:24.635 --> 31:26.771
Fix a toilet?
Okay, so here's the thing.

31:26.804 --> 31:29.139
- I'm the editor for Richard.
- See you, Ben.

31:29.172 --> 31:31.709
He probably broke the toilet.
This is wack, dude.

31:31.743 --> 31:34.344
<i>Why is
"abbreviation" such a long word?</i>

31:34.378 --> 31:36.647
<i>Why is there no mirrors
in the self-checkout?</i>

31:36.681 --> 31:38.448
<i>Can I call a white duck
a quacker?</i>

31:38.482 --> 31:39.784
<i>I got friends who are white.</i>

31:39.817 --> 31:41.485
<i>When a dog is
wearing clothes...</i>

31:41.518 --> 31:42.654
Mm.

31:42.687 --> 31:44.454
- Hi, man.
- Hey.

31:44.488 --> 31:46.658
Mickey. What's up, man? Almost
didn't see you there, man.

31:46.691 --> 31:49.661
- Dude, you're really funny.
- Thanks, man.

31:49.694 --> 31:52.095
Um, I used to be a comic.

31:52.129 --> 31:53.163
What? No way.

31:53.196 --> 31:54.531
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

31:54.565 --> 31:56.300
Yeah, um, but it's not anything

31:56.333 --> 31:57.835
that keeps me
from my work around here.

31:57.869 --> 31:59.636
I work really hard
around here, man.

31:59.671 --> 32:02.139
Dude, I loved your videos.
Loved 'em, yeah.

32:02.172 --> 32:04.207
I just had no idea
you were a comic.

32:04.241 --> 32:06.811
Man, here's the crazy thing
about those videos, dude,

32:06.844 --> 32:09.479
is I actually thought
the first one would be the one.

32:09.513 --> 32:11.348
But everybody likes
the toilet video.

32:11.381 --> 32:13.751
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dude, that one was great.

32:13.785 --> 32:16.219
- They're all great.
- Dude, I love it, man.

32:16.253 --> 32:19.423
Comedy?
It's where my heart is, man.

32:19.456 --> 32:20.658
Yeah, I can tell, man.
Well, hey, man,

32:20.692 --> 32:21.859
I subscribed, I shared it.

32:21.893 --> 32:23.427
Dude. Yo, thanks, man.

32:23.460 --> 32:25.162
I really appreciate that.

32:25.195 --> 32:26.831
Yeah, for sure.
So if comedy's your thing,

32:26.864 --> 32:29.166
dude, why aren't you out there
running with it?

32:30.902 --> 32:32.870
<i>It was my dad, man.</i>

32:32.904 --> 32:34.605
He was a comic.

32:34.638 --> 32:36.774
Leonard Marcus.
You ever heard of him?

32:36.808 --> 32:39.744
- Mm-mm.
- He was pretty funny, man.

32:39.777 --> 32:42.346
He was a big drinker,
too, though,

32:42.379 --> 32:44.181
just like his dad.

32:44.214 --> 32:47.184
As soon as I turned, like,
18 years old,

32:47.217 --> 32:48.619
I wanted to be just like him.

32:48.653 --> 32:50.822
Yeah, so,
I started doing comedy.

32:50.855 --> 32:53.323
My dad, man...

32:53.357 --> 32:55.760
he's, like,
20 years into the game.

32:55.793 --> 33:00.197
He books the biggest show ever...
and I kid you not...

33:00.230 --> 33:02.299
he's on his way
to <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

33:02.332 --> 33:04.736
He's at a red light...

33:04.769 --> 33:06.771
and his heart explodes.

33:07.939 --> 33:09.907
That's how they described it.

33:09.941 --> 33:11.876
Dude. Man.

33:11.909 --> 33:14.277
So I grieved for a while,

33:14.311 --> 33:16.413
and then, you know,
I just get back at it, man.

33:16.446 --> 33:17.882
I start hitting clubs.

33:17.915 --> 33:19.383
And the club owners are like,

33:19.416 --> 33:20.918
"Wow. Your dad was funny,
but you..."

33:20.952 --> 33:22.787
Now they...
Like, they're calling me,

33:22.820 --> 33:25.255
like, the next Damon Wayans,
Eddie Murphy.

33:25.288 --> 33:27.892
Then I start meeting
these women, right?

33:27.925 --> 33:29.927
They're, like,
in their 30s and 40s.

33:29.961 --> 33:32.195
And they knew my pops.

33:32.229 --> 33:33.798
Like, they <i>really</i> knew my pops.

33:33.831 --> 33:36.333
They start showing me pictures
of them hanging out, man,

33:36.366 --> 33:38.335
and then they'd show me pictures
of kids, man.

33:38.368 --> 33:40.303
And they're telling me they're
my half brothers and sisters.

33:40.337 --> 33:41.873
And I just...

33:41.906 --> 33:45.609
I don't know what to do, man,
so I tell my moms.

33:45.642 --> 33:46.878
That was a bad idea.

33:46.911 --> 33:48.612
She falls into depression.

33:48.645 --> 33:51.749
She just can't handle it, man,
and two years later...

33:54.484 --> 33:56.520
...she takes her own life, yo.

33:56.553 --> 33:58.956
Wow. That's... Wow.

33:58.990 --> 34:00.958
Yeah.

34:00.992 --> 34:02.994
After that, man, it was like...

34:03.027 --> 34:04.762
like nothing was funny anymore,
you know?

34:04.796 --> 34:06.329
I just quit, yo.

34:06.363 --> 34:08.565
What? Comedy?

34:10.034 --> 34:12.235
Yeah, that, too.

34:20.845 --> 34:22.412
Yo, this is Ben.

34:22.446 --> 34:25.315
<i>Hi. Is this Selfie Dad?</i>

34:25.348 --> 34:27.685
Um, yeah, this is...
this is Selfie Dad.

34:27.719 --> 34:28.986
Who's this?

34:29.020 --> 34:30.988
<i>Hey, I'm Laurie Swanson.</i>

Oh. Well, thank you...

34:42.432 --> 34:45.469

<i>Uh, we'd like to embed it

34:53.510 --> 34:55.312
<i>and we'll put a link

34:55.345 --> 34:56.714
<i>Does that work?</i>

34:56.748 --> 34:58.415
Yes.

34:58.448 --> 35:00.283
Yeah, absolutely.
That sounds great.

35:00.317 --> 35:02.385
Laurie, let's do it. Yeah.

35:02.419 --> 35:03.788
<i>Yay! Thank you.
Thank you so much.</i>

35:03.821 --> 35:05.288

we absolutely do, for sure.

Boom.

35:48.365 --> 35:49.867
Remember how
I fixed the toilet?

35:49.901 --> 35:51.936
Turns out, I could fix a car.

35:51.969 --> 35:53.537
So, number one, first thing
you want to do...

35:53.570 --> 35:55.106
need to have a car.

35:55.139 --> 35:56.908
If you find yourself
on a bus for some reason,

35:56.941 --> 35:58.475
this video is not
gonna help you.

35:58.508 --> 35:59.944
So now, you got to get
into the garage.

35:59.977 --> 36:02.412
Oh, man. I mean...

36:02.445 --> 36:03.881
Oh, man.

36:03.915 --> 36:05.615
We're gonna fix that next week.

36:05.649 --> 36:07.051
So now,
we're gonna pop the hood.

36:07.084 --> 36:09.586
We'll go ahead and pop it.
So easy. It's right here.

Where you been?

36:37.514 --> 36:39.984
Hannah's play.

36:40.017 --> 36:42.153
Hannah, listen,
your play... <i>Grease.</i>

36:42.186 --> 36:44.922
I am so sorry.
I got all caught up at work.

36:44.956 --> 36:47.357
- I was busy.
- It's cool. I'm okay.

36:50.995 --> 36:53.430
Where were you?
I called you, like, five times.

36:53.463 --> 36:55.565
- I know. Rosie was being impossible.
- You can't pick up

36:55.599 --> 36:57.134
- the phone and call your wife?
- My phone was on silent,

36:57.168 --> 36:58.936
there's producers in the room.

36:58.970 --> 37:01.138
Like, what am I supposed to do?
I was gonna come right home

37:01.172 --> 37:02.907
and then, phew, I was gonna
be at the play, but...

37:02.940 --> 37:04.474
You posted another video?

37:04.507 --> 37:07.044
I thought
you were gonna let me edit.

37:07.078 --> 37:08.946
It just took, like, two seconds.

37:08.980 --> 37:11.481
- I had to get it up, so, uh...
- Ben, can I

37:11.514 --> 37:13.084
talk to you
in the other room, please?

37:14.819 --> 37:16.988
Guilty. Guilty.
That's what I did.

37:17.021 --> 37:19.156
I made a video
instead of seeing Hannah's play.

37:19.190 --> 37:22.159
Guilty. Now what?

37:23.728 --> 37:25.196
Jesse, please, listen.

37:25.229 --> 37:27.164
I'm getting a second chance.

37:27.198 --> 37:29.432
Please hear that.

37:36.207 --> 37:38.475
"I want Rosie stuff on..."
I'm tired of it.

37:38.508 --> 37:40.644
Hey. What's up, bruh?

37:40.678 --> 37:42.213
What are you doing here?
Thought you had the week off.

37:42.246 --> 37:45.783
Oh, uh, yeah, I'm just doing
some personal work, man.

37:45.816 --> 37:48.485
Oh, dude, I shared your, uh,
car-fixing video.

37:48.518 --> 37:50.788
Hilarious. How do you come up
with that stuff?

37:50.821 --> 37:52.723
Just having fun, really, man.

37:52.757 --> 37:54.992
The crazy part is,
it's those how-to videos

37:55.026 --> 37:57.995
that really got popping,
and, uh,

37:58.029 --> 37:59.964
I don't really know "how to."
You know?

37:59.997 --> 38:01.464
- Works, man. I loved it.
- Crazy.

38:01.498 --> 38:04.534
- Loved it.
- So what's up, man?

38:04.567 --> 38:06.837
Oh, um, if you're not using it,

38:06.871 --> 38:09.240
I'm supposed to install
Final Cut on your system.

38:09.273 --> 38:12.209
All right, man. Let me get out
of your way here, bruh.

38:12.243 --> 38:13.911
Cool.

38:13.945 --> 38:16.147
Oh, before I forget,
here's the, uh...

38:16.180 --> 38:17.949
here's that book
I was telling you about.

38:17.982 --> 38:19.817
I think you'll really like it.

38:19.850 --> 38:22.153
Oh. Yeah.

38:22.186 --> 38:23.821
Thanks, man.

38:23.854 --> 38:25.990
This looks like one
I actually haven't read yet.

38:26.023 --> 38:27.925
You know?

38:27.959 --> 38:29.927
Yeah.

38:29.961 --> 38:32.629
- Thanks, man. Appreciate that.
- So, obviously,

38:32.663 --> 38:35.166
you know, he starts
with why we need the Bible,

38:35.199 --> 38:37.969
then offers some tips on,
you know, how to read it,

38:38.002 --> 38:39.536
you know, how to get the most
out of it.

38:39.569 --> 38:41.839
Oh, okay. Cool.

38:41.872 --> 38:45.776
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote
about you for my paper?

38:45.810 --> 38:47.244
What are you talking about?

38:47.278 --> 38:49.113
Yeah, your story.

38:49.146 --> 38:52.817
You know, how a guy goes from
where he was to where you are.

38:52.850 --> 38:54.852
And I wouldn't use
your real name.

38:54.885 --> 38:56.921
I'd just... I'd call you
"The Chainbreaker."

38:56.954 --> 38:59.256
Chainbreak... What?

38:59.290 --> 39:01.058
What are you talking about, man?

39:01.092 --> 39:02.927
I mean, here you are,
this comic.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.795
Parents weren't believers.

39:04.829 --> 39:06.263
I'm guessing you didn't grow up

39:06.297 --> 39:07.932
with a lot
of Christian role models.

39:07.965 --> 39:10.201
Your dad was who he was.

39:10.234 --> 39:13.037
You could have followed
in his footsteps in every way,

39:13.070 --> 39:16.073
but you didn't. Why?

39:16.107 --> 39:18.009
I don't know...

39:18.042 --> 39:20.011
God's grace, man.

39:20.044 --> 39:23.848
You go through all that, and
God just plucks you out of it.

39:23.881 --> 39:27.718
And now, I mean, you're living
your... living your life,

39:27.752 --> 39:29.220
raising your family
to love Jesus.

39:29.253 --> 39:30.855
Dude, you broke the chain.

39:30.888 --> 39:32.790
Look, Mickey,
here's the thing, man.

39:32.823 --> 39:34.624
I just got to be real with you.

39:34.658 --> 39:36.227
I think you're an awesome guy.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.561
I mean, for real, at first,

39:38.595 --> 39:40.297
I just thought you was one
of them Christian dudes,

39:40.331 --> 39:42.099
like, an oversaved Christian.

39:42.133 --> 39:44.902
Like, you only eat pizza
that's been delivered.

39:44.935 --> 39:46.904
You only got sheets on your bed,

39:46.937 --> 39:48.906
'cause you say
Jesus is your comforter.

39:48.939 --> 39:50.307
That's funny.

39:50.341 --> 39:52.710
- That was good.
- Here's my point, man. As far

39:52.743 --> 39:55.079
as me breaking chains
and stuff, bruh...

39:55.112 --> 39:57.181
...you just got the wrong dude.

39:57.214 --> 39:58.849
Hmm.

39:58.883 --> 40:00.617
Okay.

40:00.651 --> 40:03.254
Ben. Hey, there you are.

40:03.287 --> 40:06.123
Uh, listen,
Steven wants to see you.

40:06.157 --> 40:08.659
Oh, okay.

40:08.692 --> 40:09.860
<i>You know, he's,</i>

40:09.894 --> 40:13.064
he's... he's always provided
for us.

40:14.098 --> 40:15.900
But he's so extreme, I...

40:15.933 --> 40:18.202
It's like he's an addict.

40:18.235 --> 40:19.636
An addict?

40:19.670 --> 40:20.838
Yeah, he acts like it.

40:22.706 --> 40:25.242
Jesse, how much
do you pray for him?

40:26.277 --> 40:27.978
Yeah, I-I...

40:28.012 --> 40:30.347
Probably not as much
as I should.

40:30.381 --> 40:31.816
Okay, not at all.

40:33.951 --> 40:35.986
We can't change them.

40:36.020 --> 40:39.990
And sometimes the harder we try,
the worse it makes things.

40:41.092 --> 40:43.060
We need God.

40:43.094 --> 40:48.032
And if we're not praying
for our husbands, who will?

40:49.433 --> 40:53.337
Have you ever seen
the movie <i>War Room?</i>

40:53.370 --> 40:55.873
I don't really like
Christian films.

40:59.210 --> 41:00.978
- Just...
- Oh.

41:04.815 --> 41:06.183
Hey, Carol.

41:06.217 --> 41:07.718
- How you doing? Cool.
- I'm good, good, good.

41:07.751 --> 41:09.186
- How's-how's Tom?
- Oh, he's good, good.

41:09.220 --> 41:10.754
Listen, we're finishing here,

41:10.788 --> 41:12.857
and I'll leave you family time.

41:12.890 --> 41:14.358
No, no-no, you don't have
to go anywhere

41:14.391 --> 41:16.060
'cause I'm-I'm,
I'm just gonna read the mail

41:16.093 --> 41:17.928
'cause I got this mail,
so I'm just gonna read this

41:17.962 --> 41:19.196
and stuff, so...

41:19.230 --> 41:20.397
Okay.

41:20.431 --> 41:21.398
It's gonna be good.

41:21.432 --> 41:22.867
You, you guys are female.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.068
I'm...

41:24.101 --> 41:26.070
Okay, I'm gonna go.

41:26.103 --> 41:28.672
Can we just pray
for him right now?

41:28.706 --> 41:29.673
Right now.

41:29.707 --> 41:31.208
Thank you.

41:37.481 --> 41:39.049
<i>Father,</i>

41:39.083 --> 41:43.220
I pray that You will help
Jesse to be gentle

41:43.254 --> 41:46.957
and respectful toward Ben,
no matter what,

41:46.991 --> 41:51.462
and I pray, Father,
that she will find her joy

41:51.495 --> 41:53.831
in You.

41:53.864 --> 41:55.399
Hey, Carol gone?

41:55.432 --> 41:56.834
Yeah.

41:56.867 --> 41:58.402
- Cool.
- Um, Ben, listen.

41:58.435 --> 42:00.404
- I...
- You guys have a good talk?

42:00.437 --> 42:02.206
- It was good, I just want to say that I...
- So, look.

42:02.239 --> 42:03.440
I got something
I need to tell you.

42:03.474 --> 42:06.443
Uh... ah...

42:06.477 --> 42:07.444
I got fired,

42:07.478 --> 42:09.446
but before you flip out,

42:09.480 --> 42:10.447
hear me out.

42:10.481 --> 42:12.016
Um, I've been running

42:12.049 --> 42:13.217
- some numbers, and...
- You got fired?!

42:13.250 --> 42:16.220
Whoa-whoa, don't, don't do
that thing where you flip out.

42:16.253 --> 42:17.354
- From your job?!
- I did, yes.

42:17.388 --> 42:19.456
Look, boom.

42:19.490 --> 42:20.724
First video check.

42:20.758 --> 42:22.126
Dad got fired?

42:22.159 --> 42:23.894
I just... that's what I...
I just said that.

42:23.928 --> 42:26.463
- I'm... I know it seems scary.
- This is for $43!

42:26.497 --> 42:29.433
The pay period was like two days
into the toilet video.

42:29.466 --> 42:32.436
The toilet video has gone kaboom
in a big way.

42:32.469 --> 42:34.271
But I don't understand
how they can fire you.

42:34.305 --> 42:35.839
So Dad did get fired?

42:35.873 --> 42:37.975
I really don't care
what Rosie has to say.

42:38.008 --> 42:40.177
- I know.
- You've won, like, every single award.

42:40.211 --> 42:43.047
How crazy would it be
if I dropped a video a week?

42:43.080 --> 42:44.315
Here comes your sister.

42:44.348 --> 42:45.849
- I got fired.
- What is going on?

42:45.883 --> 42:46.750
- Dad got fired.
- Yes, yes.

42:54.491 --> 42:56.260
Yeah, absolutely,
Mickey, I get it.

42:56.293 --> 42:59.430
Nobody likes being fired,
but, hey, you know...

42:59.463 --> 43:01.832
Oh, yeah, and-and thanks,
man, for...

43:01.865 --> 43:03.033
Oh, the book?

43:03.067 --> 43:07.071
Yep, uh, yeah, I got that book
right here, for sure, man,

43:07.104 --> 43:08.405
so thanks for that.

43:08.439 --> 43:11.308
And, yes, text me,
call me anytime, man.

43:11.342 --> 43:13.077
We'll absolutely stay in touch.

43:13.110 --> 43:15.946
Okay. Yo, I appreciate you,
man, a lot.

43:15.980 --> 43:17.214
So thanks a lot, man, yep.

43:17.248 --> 43:20.017
Okay, bye.

43:23.821 --> 43:25.789
Are you wearing that to church?

43:25.823 --> 43:27.825
I-I'm not going to church.

43:27.858 --> 43:29.860
I got a lot of stuff to do.
You guys go ahead.

43:31.095 --> 43:33.430
Ben, did you buy more equipment?

43:33.464 --> 43:35.132
It's not just any equipment.

43:35.165 --> 43:36.433
It's Blackmagic.

43:37.468 --> 43:39.270
My husband,

43:39.303 --> 43:43.173
my beloved,
who I love and respect,

43:43.207 --> 43:44.875
can you at least take a break

43:44.908 --> 43:47.177
and come to church
with your family?

43:48.312 --> 43:50.080
I'm gonna take a break.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

43:50.114 --> 43:51.915
I'm gonna hook this up,
I'm gonna have Internet.

43:51.949 --> 43:53.884
Maybe I'll just jump in
and watch online.

43:53.917 --> 43:55.552
<i>Yo no puedo creer.</i>

44:00.991 --> 44:03.127
Hello again,
this is Selfie Dad.

44:03.160 --> 44:04.862
Today we're gonna be
hanging a light.

44:04.895 --> 44:08.332
You want to make sure your
chains are equally set apart

44:08.365 --> 44:11.101
and that you already have
the screw in place.

44:11.135 --> 44:13.570
Put this on the screw,
making sure it's secure...

44:17.107 --> 44:18.375
This is Selfie Dad,

44:18.409 --> 44:20.377
and today I want to show you

44:20.411 --> 44:23.080
how to clean up glass
before your wife comes home.

44:37.161 --> 44:39.229
<i>So, what can people
expect when they visit your page?</i>

44:39.263 --> 44:40.931
Well, first of all,

44:40.964 --> 44:44.201
they can expect a new video
every Tuesday, right,

44:44.234 --> 44:46.570
and if they like it, they should
probably tell their friends,

44:46.603 --> 44:49.373
and if they don't like it, they
probably don't got no friends.

44:51.909 --> 44:52.943
Please!

44:54.545 --> 44:56.613
We are going to create
a lot of content.

44:56.647 --> 44:58.382
No, I'm the one that's excited.

44:58.415 --> 45:00.017
I just got
my first endorsement deal.

45:00.050 --> 45:01.251
Cool.

45:01.285 --> 45:04.154
If you want to fix it right...
gablow...

45:04.188 --> 45:07.024
you need to get yourself
some Packer Tools...

45:07.057 --> 45:10.260
tools for what you need to fix
and tools for life.

45:10.294 --> 45:11.895
<i>It is the Digital Media Awards.</i>

45:11.929 --> 45:13.897
<i>It's gonna be the best one yet,
you guys.</i>

45:13.931 --> 45:18.001
<i>The nominees this year are:
Lanie Basinger,</i>

45:18.035 --> 45:20.404
<i>Ryan Kwan, Brian Perez,</i>

45:20.437 --> 45:23.340
aka Tuba Luba, and, of course,

45:23.374 --> 45:26.310
- <i>Ben Marcus, aka Selfie Dad.</i>
- Oh, yes, I am the man, yes.

45:26.343 --> 45:27.478
I don't see <i>The Jamie Grace Show</i>
in there.

45:27.511 --> 45:29.346
It's fine, it's just a typo.

45:29.380 --> 45:31.315
- Yes.
- <i>So make sure you tune in on the 11th</i>

45:31.348 --> 45:32.950
to see who wins.
Aah!

45:32.983 --> 45:35.352
<i>The party's at Sophie's house...</i>

45:35.386 --> 45:39.189
well, her dad's house, but he's
traveling for work or something.

45:39.223 --> 45:41.024
You should totally come.

45:44.228 --> 45:46.130
I mean, I mean, her house is

45:46.163 --> 45:47.665
only two blocks away
from my house.

45:47.699 --> 45:49.667
I'll walk.

45:49.701 --> 45:53.137
But you can pick me up
if you want.

45:53.170 --> 45:54.571
<i>And the winner</i>

45:54.605 --> 45:56.073
<i>for Best New Comic...
as opposed to me.</i>

45:56.106 --> 45:57.274
<i>You know,
I'm the best old comic.</i>

45:57.307 --> 46:00.210
<i>Man, I started with the
Flintstones. Barney loved me.</i>

46:00.244 --> 46:02.179
<i>Did my first two jokes
at the Last Supper.</i>

46:02.212 --> 46:06.250
<i>Anyway, uh, for the winner
of UTOO's Best New Comic,</i>

46:06.283 --> 46:09.253
<i>it is my man Ben Marcus,
Selfie Dad.</i>

46:24.535 --> 46:26.671
So, the company is Packer Tools.

46:26.704 --> 46:28.305
- <i>Yeah, man.</i>
- <i>Oh, man, see, that's sweet.</i>

46:28.338 --> 46:29.273
<i>That's that butter right there.</i>

46:29.306 --> 46:32.075
You got to remember,
endorsements are key.

46:32.109 --> 46:33.977
<i>That's what I'm finding out.
So, how many you got?</i>

46:34.011 --> 46:35.412
Man, I got more endorsements

46:35.446 --> 46:37.347
than Van Camp got
pork and beans.

46:37.381 --> 46:38.549
You know what?
Last year they gave me

46:38.582 --> 46:40.050
so much endorsement money,

46:40.083 --> 46:41.585
when I went to deposit it
in the bank,

46:41.618 --> 46:43.020
I was embarrassed.

46:43.053 --> 46:45.122
Call my girl,
she'll give you 50% off.

46:45.155 --> 46:49.460
Just tell her I sent you,
and... she's gonna love you.

46:49.493 --> 46:50.695
Excuse me one second.

46:50.728 --> 46:53.597
And the thing just blew up.
It kind of took off from there.

46:53.630 --> 46:56.600
Yeah, next thing you know, boom,
and here we are today...

46:56.633 --> 46:57.702
Hey, what's up?
I'm Ben.

46:57.735 --> 46:59.503
Laurie Swanson, LaughLoud.com.

46:59.536 --> 47:02.406
Oh, hey, right, yeah...

47:02.439 --> 47:04.107
Congratulations.
I knew you'd win.

47:04.141 --> 47:06.410
Thanks a lot. I really,
really appreciate that a lot.

47:06.443 --> 47:08.780
This is Laurie...
she's an awesome interviewer,

47:08.813 --> 47:10.614
yeah, and other things,
I'm sure.

47:10.647 --> 47:13.016
So, where's Selfie Mom?

47:13.050 --> 47:15.486
Yeah, she, she couldn't make it
tonight, unfortunately.

47:15.519 --> 47:16.688
Aw.

47:16.721 --> 47:18.121
Yeah.

47:19.289 --> 47:20.758
<i>Well, I wanted</i>

47:20.792 --> 47:25.128
to be a novelist like
Jane Austen, Margaret Mitchell.

47:25.162 --> 47:27.765
Yeah, they're awesome,
they are, really.

47:27.799 --> 47:30.033
You have no idea
who I'm talking about.

47:30.067 --> 47:31.101
Oh, no, I do.

47:31.134 --> 47:33.170
Um... <i>Green Eggs and Ham?</i>

47:34.404 --> 47:35.572
- Yeah.
- Uh...

47:35.606 --> 47:37.107
Same genre, right?

47:37.140 --> 47:38.710
Not exactly.

47:38.743 --> 47:41.311
Well, listen,
if you ever do read any of that,

47:41.345 --> 47:44.047
uh, you want to make sure
you don't do it in a house

47:44.081 --> 47:45.148
or with a mouse.

47:45.182 --> 47:47.117
You know.

47:47.150 --> 47:48.686
I'll try not to.

48:00.497 --> 48:03.367
Okay, we definitely have to do
a follow-up interview.

48:03.400 --> 48:05.536
Okay, yeah, okay, sure.

48:05.569 --> 48:06.637
How about right now?

48:06.671 --> 48:08.171
Now?

48:08.205 --> 48:09.540
Yeah, why not?

48:09.573 --> 48:11.475
I mean, are-are you staying
at the hotel?

48:11.508 --> 48:13.410
'Cause I want to get out
of these clothes.

48:14.779 --> 48:17.715
No!

48:17.749 --> 48:19.182
I mean, are you in a hurry...

48:19.216 --> 48:20.818
I mean, are you
in a hurry to leave?

48:20.852 --> 48:22.386
I didn't mean it like that.

48:22.419 --> 48:25.556
Oh, yeah, I know
you didn't mean that, I know.

48:27.558 --> 48:30.394
Unless you wanted me to.

48:34.131 --> 48:35.867
Oh.

48:35.900 --> 48:37.467
Oh, hey, what?

48:41.538 --> 48:42.774
Sorry.

48:44.541 --> 48:46.844
I'm sorry, that was a, uh...

48:46.878 --> 48:48.846
So, uh...

48:48.880 --> 48:52.449
um... what were
we talking about?

48:53.483 --> 48:56.486
I don't know.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.722
You tell me.

49:00.925 --> 49:02.727
Yeah.

49:02.760 --> 49:06.430
Hey, maybe, maybe we should do
the interview another time.

49:37.929 --> 49:40.430
Hey, you're awake.

49:43.233 --> 49:45.903
What in the world?

49:45.937 --> 49:48.572
I made your favorite.

49:50.574 --> 49:53.911
It's not every day
that your husband wins

49:53.945 --> 49:56.814
New Comic of the Year.

49:58.615 --> 50:00.652
I've been such a <i>tonto,</i>
haven't I?

50:00.685 --> 50:02.920
Yeah.

50:02.954 --> 50:04.689
But so have I.

50:04.722 --> 50:06.423
I should've been
more supportive.

50:07.557 --> 50:09.559
And I love you.

50:12.262 --> 50:13.530
We are celebrating, okay?

50:13.563 --> 50:15.800
And... I am gonna
wake up Hannah,

50:15.833 --> 50:17.935
'cause she loves my pancakes.

50:35.485 --> 50:36.888
So...

50:36.921 --> 50:39.423
how was your night?

50:42.727 --> 50:44.294
Hey, listen, uh...

50:44.327 --> 50:46.329
we're ahead on most
of our videos right now,

50:46.363 --> 50:48.700
but, uh, pretty soon
we'll have to film some more

50:48.733 --> 50:51.969
and, uh... I want you
to be the editor, okay?

50:52.003 --> 50:54.404
You always say that.

50:54.438 --> 50:56.841
But you kind of always lie.

50:59.276 --> 51:01.779
I can't find her.

51:03.881 --> 51:05.515
Hannah?

51:05.549 --> 51:07.317
Wait, what do you mean?

51:07.350 --> 51:08.318
<i>Hannah?</i>

51:08.351 --> 51:09.486
It's your dad.

51:09.519 --> 51:11.588
I need you to call me now,
please.

51:11.621 --> 51:13.991
Hi, Mrs. Weissman,
it's Jesse Marcus.

51:14.025 --> 51:16.593
I'm-I'm Hannah's mom.
Remember we met at the play?

51:16.626 --> 51:18.528
Online, Facebook, all of that.

51:18.562 --> 51:19.664
I thought maybe
there was some sort

51:19.697 --> 51:20.798
of school activity or something.

51:20.832 --> 51:21.933
I know she's not picking up.

51:21.966 --> 51:24.434
I have a phone, too, okay?

51:24.468 --> 51:26.536
I'm-a go find her.

51:48.525 --> 51:50.695
<i>So what did the police say?</i>

51:51.929 --> 51:54.799
They said that girls her age...

51:54.832 --> 51:56.868
they run away with a...

51:56.901 --> 51:58.035
a boy.

51:58.069 --> 52:00.337
There's no boy.

52:00.370 --> 52:02.405
Right?

52:02.439 --> 52:04.008
Maybe.

52:05.109 --> 52:07.644
I met him at her play.

52:13.918 --> 52:17.487
But then they asked
for her dental records.

52:21.893 --> 52:23.861
<i>Is Hannah gone forever?</i>

52:23.895 --> 52:25.428
Do not even, don't think that.

52:25.462 --> 52:26.563
She's-she's fine.

52:26.596 --> 52:28.933
Everything's gonna be okay.

52:30.567 --> 52:32.103
So what do we do?

52:32.136 --> 52:34.038
We do what the police said.

52:34.071 --> 52:36.473
We-we-we wait.

52:36.506 --> 52:38.943
Carol and Tom

52:38.976 --> 52:42.680
will be here in about
a half an hour.

52:42.713 --> 52:44.816
I was just, uh...

52:44.849 --> 52:46.851
hoping that...

52:48.618 --> 52:50.087
I think we should pray.

52:52.622 --> 52:54.091
Okay.

52:54.125 --> 52:56.626
Okay.

52:58.696 --> 53:01.032
Okay, um...

53:02.700 --> 53:06.403
Okay, uh, Dear God, um...

53:08.638 --> 53:11.142
I, uh...

53:11.175 --> 53:14.045
I don't, I don't understand
what's going on.

53:14.078 --> 53:16.747
I just, I just know

53:16.781 --> 53:18.115
that You know.

53:21.919 --> 53:23.855
You know where Hannah is.

53:25.790 --> 53:27.892
Lord, and I'm praying that...

53:27.925 --> 53:29.459
<i>we're</i> praying...

53:30.862 --> 53:32.763
...that You will keep her safe,

53:32.797 --> 53:34.799
that You bring her home.

53:37.869 --> 53:40.570
Bring her home.

53:40.604 --> 53:42.773
Amen.

53:42.807 --> 53:44.809
Amen.

53:49.512 --> 53:51.082
- Oh!
- Hannah!

53:51.115 --> 53:53.951
Oh, my baby, oh, my baby!

53:53.985 --> 53:55.987
Oh...

54:00.725 --> 54:03.060
Have you done this before?

54:06.529 --> 54:08.699
Y-Yes.

54:08.733 --> 54:11.601
I'm usually back
before you get up.

54:13.503 --> 54:15.106
The party went late.

54:15.139 --> 54:19.010
And... I accidentally
fell asleep.

54:19.043 --> 54:20.945
Hannah, you really scared us.

54:20.978 --> 54:23.413
- I'm sorry.
- What was it, was it a boy?

54:24.815 --> 54:27.718
Yes.

54:27.752 --> 54:30.087
The one from the play?

54:30.121 --> 54:32.990
Yeah.

54:33.024 --> 54:35.625
But nothing happened, Dad.

54:35.660 --> 54:38.428
Turns out...
he's a massive loser.

54:41.832 --> 54:43.566
Am I grounded forever?

54:43.600 --> 54:45.002
I don't know.

54:45.036 --> 54:47.204
Talk about that later.

55:07.692 --> 55:09.894
Hey, Mickey, what's up, man?

55:09.927 --> 55:12.063
Aw, yeah, man, we're...

55:12.096 --> 55:14.098
I'm good, man, I'm good.
How you doing?

55:15.132 --> 55:16.734
So what...

55:16.767 --> 55:18.803
what made you call right now?

55:18.836 --> 55:22.039
Like... like, now.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.608
I mean, she's sorry and...

55:25.642 --> 55:27.878
everything's okay, but...

55:27.912 --> 55:31.282
I feel like I don't
even know her.

55:31.315 --> 55:33.284
And my son...

55:33.317 --> 55:35.953
he thinks I'm a liar.

55:35.987 --> 55:38.222
And he's right.

55:38.255 --> 55:41.092
And my wife...

55:42.159 --> 55:43.227
Let's just say I came

55:43.260 --> 55:45.562
so close last night.

55:46.831 --> 55:48.565
My bad, man, I shouldn't...

55:48.598 --> 55:50.267
I don't mean to dump
all this stuff on you, man.

55:50.301 --> 55:53.237
No, no, it's okay, really.

55:53.270 --> 55:56.040
I guess I'm just not
the guy you think I am, man.

55:56.073 --> 55:57.842
Look, man, I know you're...

55:57.875 --> 56:00.811
You're a mess.

56:00.845 --> 56:03.047
We're all a mess.

56:03.080 --> 56:05.548
That's why we need Jesus.

56:05.582 --> 56:07.952
I mean, He's the way,
He's-He's...

56:07.985 --> 56:09.687
He's the only way.

56:09.720 --> 56:11.989
Well, He's the way, man.
I just...

56:12.023 --> 56:13.758
Look, God is, um...

56:13.791 --> 56:17.962
Sometimes you can relate God
to a navigational system.

56:17.995 --> 56:19.663
You put in the directions.

56:19.697 --> 56:21.598
It says to go two blocks
and turn left,

56:21.631 --> 56:23.701
but you go two blocks
and you turn right.

56:23.734 --> 56:26.636
Now that doesn't
change the destination.

56:26.670 --> 56:29.340
It just recalculates
what you need to do

56:29.373 --> 56:32.076
to get there
from where you are now.

56:32.109 --> 56:34.678
And if we keep making
the wrong turns,

56:34.712 --> 56:36.680
you know, the roads,
they-they change.

56:36.714 --> 56:38.983
They get rougher.

56:39.016 --> 56:41.152
But that's where Jesus comes in.

56:41.185 --> 56:43.754
The Jesus of the Bible.

56:43.788 --> 56:45.322
Yeah, well...

56:45.356 --> 56:46.857
I don't...

56:46.891 --> 56:49.693
I don't even know
where I got off track.

56:50.995 --> 56:54.098
Maybe... 'cause I wanted
to be noticed

56:54.131 --> 56:57.268
or I wanted to be somebody.

56:57.301 --> 56:59.136
Then I come home,

56:59.170 --> 57:01.672
I see my family and I know,

57:01.705 --> 57:03.908
like, I know what
they need is they,

57:03.941 --> 57:07.111
they need for me to be, like...

57:07.144 --> 57:10.347
a father who...

57:10.381 --> 57:13.851
you know, and-and he's there...
no matter if he can't be.

57:13.884 --> 57:16.854
Because if he moves
like he needs to,

57:16.887 --> 57:18.989
and then they're eating and...

57:19.023 --> 57:21.358
you know, he's supplying
the stuff, but he's...

57:21.392 --> 57:24.728
nurture,
and I got to be that...

57:24.762 --> 57:25.996
you know?

57:28.332 --> 57:31.769
What I think
you're trying to say is...

57:31.802 --> 57:33.804
you love your family.

57:36.006 --> 57:37.842
- Right?
- Yeah.

57:37.875 --> 57:39.143
Absolutely.

57:39.176 --> 57:41.212
They know that.

57:41.245 --> 57:43.080
But what if...

57:43.114 --> 57:45.349
the greatest somebody
you can be...

57:45.382 --> 57:48.319
is a man all in for God?

57:48.352 --> 57:51.155
What if you dove
deeper into the Bible

57:51.188 --> 57:53.390
than you ever have before?

57:55.259 --> 57:57.328
Look, man, you're...

57:57.361 --> 57:58.662
you're young, dude.

57:58.696 --> 58:00.798
I got kids, my wife.

58:00.831 --> 58:03.734
I can't afford to be sitting
around, reading the Bible.

58:03.767 --> 58:05.269
See...

58:05.302 --> 58:08.038
you have a wife
and kids and a family

58:08.072 --> 58:10.007
and responsibilities.

58:10.040 --> 58:13.210
You can't afford
<i>not</i> to read the Bible.

58:21.986 --> 58:24.155
It got, it got awkward for us.

58:24.188 --> 58:26.023
- Little bit, yeah, little bit.
- You staring at me and stuff.

58:26.056 --> 58:28.259
You felt that? I felt it.

58:28.292 --> 58:32.396
Look, man, break the chain
for good.

58:32.429 --> 58:34.398
And give me something
good to write about.

58:36.033 --> 58:38.736
I was looking for you.

58:38.769 --> 58:40.704
Mickey leave?

58:40.738 --> 58:42.373
Yeah, he left a while ago.

58:42.406 --> 58:43.807
Hmm.

58:43.841 --> 58:46.010
Did you guys have a good talk?

58:46.043 --> 58:47.378
You know, we did.

58:47.411 --> 58:49.180
He, uh...

58:49.213 --> 58:51.782
he actually thinks that I should
dig into the Bible more

58:51.815 --> 58:53.851
and, uh... get to know
the real Jesus.

58:55.753 --> 58:56.921
You know what, here.

58:56.954 --> 58:58.355
Turn, look at,
can you look at...?

58:58.389 --> 59:00.057
Just turn this way?
Just... look at the wall.

59:00.090 --> 59:02.459
Just... okay, cool.

59:02.493 --> 59:04.228
The weird part is...

59:04.261 --> 59:06.931
I actually want
to read the Bible more.

59:09.967 --> 59:11.869
I thought you was gonna faint.

59:11.902 --> 59:13.437
I just...

59:14.805 --> 59:16.907
Is Hannah awake yet?

59:16.941 --> 59:18.943
- Yeah.
- Okay.

59:27.518 --> 59:29.086
Yeah?

59:30.554 --> 59:32.156
Can I come in?

59:32.189 --> 59:34.325
Sure.

59:36.527 --> 59:39.363
Mom came in earlier,
asked me why I did it.

59:39.396 --> 59:41.098
I told her I don't know.

59:41.131 --> 59:43.500
Look, Hanns, I don't...

59:43.534 --> 59:45.236
I don't even care
why you did it.

59:45.269 --> 59:47.438
I'm... I'm just glad
that you didn't do,

59:47.471 --> 59:50.307
you know, the thing that you,
that you didn't do.

59:50.341 --> 59:51.909
What didn't I do?

59:51.942 --> 59:53.244
The-the thing
that you didn't do.

59:53.277 --> 59:54.378
That you, that you shouldn't do.

59:54.411 --> 59:55.546
What? What didn't I do?

59:55.579 --> 59:57.281
You know, the boy from the play.

59:57.314 --> 59:59.149
Dad, he's a massive loser.

59:59.183 --> 1:00:01.452
Yeah, you said that.

1:00:01.485 --> 1:00:03.520
I'm sorry, just this is...

1:00:03.554 --> 1:00:06.223
It's a little awkward talking
to my dad about this stuff.

1:00:06.257 --> 1:00:07.992
It is.
I know I'm the last person

1:00:08.025 --> 1:00:11.295
you want to talk to about this,
but it's just, Hanns,

1:00:11.328 --> 1:00:13.497
what you did
was-was really dumb.

1:00:13.530 --> 1:00:15.833
Look, I'd be lying

1:00:15.866 --> 1:00:17.935
to you if I didn't tell you
when I was your age,

1:00:17.968 --> 1:00:19.903
I didn't do the same thing.

1:00:19.937 --> 1:00:21.405
There's nobody in this house

1:00:21.438 --> 1:00:24.041
who's done more dumb things
than I have.

1:00:24.074 --> 1:00:26.277
We could take away
your cell phone

1:00:26.310 --> 1:00:28.312
and ground you...
we could do all sorts of things.

1:00:28.345 --> 1:00:30.214
But I don't want
to do any of that.

1:00:30.247 --> 1:00:34.051
I just want to have an open,
honest relationship.

1:00:34.084 --> 1:00:37.187
There's no way I can ask you
to be a better daughter

1:00:37.221 --> 1:00:39.356
if I'm not willing
to be a better father.

1:00:39.390 --> 1:00:41.258
And I am.

1:00:41.292 --> 1:00:43.861
I'm-a do my part.

1:00:43.894 --> 1:00:46.196
All I ask is that...

1:00:47.898 --> 1:00:50.567
Please, don't sneak out anymore.

1:00:59.510 --> 1:01:02.479

<i>It's one thing

1:01:24.601 --> 1:01:26.403
<i>But as you learn
the Word of God</i>

1:01:26.437 --> 1:01:28.305
<i>by the power

1:01:28.339 --> 1:01:30.941
<i>you're able to learn
to live in obedience to it.</i>

1:01:30.974 --> 1:01:33.444
First John chapter two
says this.

1:01:33.477 --> 1:01:36.080
"Whoever says, 'I know Him, '

1:01:36.113 --> 1:01:39.883
"but does not do
what He commands

1:01:39.917 --> 1:01:43.587
is a liar, and the truth
is not in that person."

1:01:45.657 --> 1:01:48.625
Okay. So, uh...

1:01:48.660 --> 1:01:51.161
This book that Mickey gave me,
right?

1:01:51.195 --> 1:01:53.030
It explains
that a good place to start

1:01:53.063 --> 1:01:54.565
is, like, in First John.

1:01:54.598 --> 1:01:57.901
Five chapters long.
You just read it for 30 days.

1:01:57.935 --> 1:02:01.405
Then after that, what you do is
you move to the Gospel of John,

1:02:01.438 --> 1:02:03.140
which is, like,
21 chapters long.

1:02:03.173 --> 1:02:05.677
So, you read the first section,
30 days.

1:02:05.710 --> 1:02:09.113
Next seven, 30 days.
Next seven, 30 days.

1:02:09.146 --> 1:02:11.115
Go, after you do that, like,
with the New Testament,

1:02:11.148 --> 1:02:13.417
it'll be, like,
two and a half years

1:02:13.450 --> 1:02:15.085
before you're completely done.

1:02:15.119 --> 1:02:16.920
But you will be beast.

1:02:16.954 --> 1:02:18.288
Can I be done?

1:02:18.322 --> 1:02:20.658
Jack, this is important.

1:02:20.692 --> 1:02:22.493
I have a stomachache.

1:02:22.526 --> 1:02:23.927
Oh, my gosh.

1:02:23.961 --> 1:02:26.163
- You are such a liar.
- I am not.

1:02:26.196 --> 1:02:28.232
I have homework to do.

1:02:28.265 --> 1:02:30.067
- You're the liar.
- Really? You want

1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:32.136
- to go upstairs and see my homework?
- Okay, <i>chicos.</i>

1:02:32.169 --> 1:02:35.172
- Maybe that's enough for today.
- Yes.

1:02:37.341 --> 1:02:41.378
Baby, I am so proud of you.

1:02:41.412 --> 1:02:45.549
And I have never,
and I mean <i>never...</i>

1:02:45.582 --> 1:02:48.085
been more attracted to you.

1:02:49.586 --> 1:02:53.257
Maybe we should have the kids
go to bed early tonight.

1:02:54.759 --> 1:02:57.594
Maybe they could take a nap
right now.

1:03:08.639 --> 1:03:11.074
Yo, yo, yo.

1:03:11.108 --> 1:03:12.744
It's been a while
since I made a video.

1:03:12.777 --> 1:03:14.411
In fact, probably not since

1:03:14.445 --> 1:03:16.714
you voted me
New Comic of the Year.

1:03:16.748 --> 1:03:19.684
And now my new sponsor,
Packer Tools,

1:03:19.717 --> 1:03:22.553
they're gonna make sure
that we cranking out the videos

1:03:22.586 --> 1:03:24.254
and fixing a bunch of stuff.

1:03:24.288 --> 1:03:25.723
We might fix
the Cleveland Browns.

1:03:25.757 --> 1:03:28.392
The economy.
We might fix breakfast.

1:03:28.425 --> 1:03:31.128
I got to show you the award.
I got to show this to you.

1:03:31.161 --> 1:03:34.031
Boom.
I am in awe over this thing.

1:03:34.064 --> 1:03:37.067
I don't know what could be
more important.

1:03:38.670 --> 1:03:40.304
Actually, I do.

1:03:40.337 --> 1:03:42.639
Hold on one second.

1:03:42.674 --> 1:03:46.143
This right here
has changed the game.

1:03:46.176 --> 1:03:47.745
Even now, I haven't read
the whole Bible.

1:03:47.779 --> 1:03:50.782
I thought the Bible was a story
about a dude named Moses

1:03:50.815 --> 1:03:54.017
who didn't want the frogs
to hit his people.

1:03:54.051 --> 1:03:55.118
God sent, like, His son.

1:03:55.152 --> 1:03:57.689
Mel Gibson was there, right?
He shared his passion.

1:03:57.722 --> 1:04:00.591
And then they got together,
and it was like <i>Lethal Weapon.</i>

1:04:00.624 --> 1:04:03.293
It's way, way, way greater
than that.

1:04:03.327 --> 1:04:04.361
I fix stuff.

1:04:04.394 --> 1:04:05.596
Long before I got here,

1:04:05.629 --> 1:04:07.665
this world was broken.

1:04:07.699 --> 1:04:11.034
And Jesus came to truly fix it.

1:04:11.068 --> 1:04:13.637
And all I'm trying to do
is follow Him.

1:04:13.671 --> 1:04:16.306
Everything's not perfect.

1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:19.343
But I know
I got to be a better dad.

1:04:20.678 --> 1:04:23.313
I got to be a better husband.

1:04:23.347 --> 1:04:26.316
And some of these things,
I just can't fix

1:04:26.350 --> 1:04:28.552
without some sort of direction.

1:04:28.585 --> 1:04:30.587
And I'm finding it right here.

1:04:30.621 --> 1:04:33.257
I'm Selfie Dad.

1:04:37.261 --> 1:04:39.129
Hey. Who were you talking to?

1:04:41.799 --> 1:04:43.701
I was actually doing a video.

1:04:43.735 --> 1:04:46.336
Oh, I thought you had enough
videos for a couple weeks.

1:04:46.370 --> 1:04:48.438
I do, but...

1:04:48.472 --> 1:04:50.274
I just got inspired.

1:04:50.307 --> 1:04:51.642
I mean...

1:04:51.676 --> 1:04:54.177
Like, this one,
this one's gonna be different.

1:04:54.211 --> 1:04:56.814
You gonna really like it.
It might actually lead

1:04:56.848 --> 1:04:59.483
to more evenings like,
you know...

1:04:59.516 --> 1:05:02.452
Okay.

1:05:02.486 --> 1:05:05.723
So, what was, um,
what was so different about it?

1:05:05.757 --> 1:05:08.592
Actually, you know what?
Jack should edit this one.

1:05:08.625 --> 1:05:10.360
When's he get home?

1:05:10.394 --> 1:05:12.596
Um, I pick him up at 3:00.

1:05:12.629 --> 1:05:14.398
Oh, cool.

1:05:14.431 --> 1:05:17.835
Okay, so, what's different
is the content matter.

1:05:17.869 --> 1:05:20.103
Like...

1:05:20.137 --> 1:05:22.406
You just wait. You'll see.

1:05:22.439 --> 1:05:24.174
Looks good on you.

1:05:24.207 --> 1:05:25.375
What?

1:05:25.409 --> 1:05:27.377
Your smile.

1:05:27.411 --> 1:05:30.414
Oh, Ben.

1:05:32.449 --> 1:05:34.585
Dude, you fast.

1:05:34.618 --> 1:05:36.486
You learned all this from watching videos?

1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:38.121
- Pretty much.
- So,

1:05:38.155 --> 1:05:40.324
- how is the secret video coming along?
- Don't look.

1:05:40.357 --> 1:05:41.525
Okay, I won't look.

1:05:41.558 --> 1:05:43.260
So, here's the thing.
It's almost done,

1:05:43.293 --> 1:05:45.897
and this dude
is brilliant on this.

1:05:45.930 --> 1:05:48.398
I am so proud of both of you.

1:05:48.432 --> 1:05:51.301
Jack did the editing,
Hannah picked the title,

1:05:51.335 --> 1:05:52.804
and Moms clicked "upload."

1:05:52.837 --> 1:05:55.873
The way I see it, we just made
our first family video.

1:05:55.907 --> 1:05:57.909
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.
- And, Hannah, listen.

1:05:57.942 --> 1:05:59.777
I know you love performing,

1:05:59.811 --> 1:06:02.613
like you did in the, uh...
You know, your play.

1:06:02.646 --> 1:06:05.315
But, uh, in future videos,

1:06:05.349 --> 1:06:06.918
I want you to act.

1:06:06.951 --> 1:06:08.418
Hmm. Okay.

1:06:08.452 --> 1:06:11.555
Um, are they all gonna be,

1:06:11.588 --> 1:06:14.124
like, Bible videos?

1:06:14.926 --> 1:06:16.694
Yeah.

1:06:16.728 --> 1:06:19.296
Yeah, why not.

1:06:30.975 --> 1:06:33.176
What in the world?

1:06:38.816 --> 1:06:41.284
What in the world?

1:06:41.318 --> 1:06:43.286
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:45.288
Yeah, I'm sure. You should read
some of these comments.

1:06:45.322 --> 1:06:47.224
Actually,
don't read the comments.

1:06:47.257 --> 1:06:50.193
It's clear I got a lot of fans
that don't like Jesus.

1:06:50.227 --> 1:06:52.195
Well, can you delete the video?

1:06:52.229 --> 1:06:54.197
I don't really want
to delete the video.

1:06:54.231 --> 1:06:56.433
- I mean, I kind of like the Jesus video.
- Well, Ben,

1:06:56.466 --> 1:06:57.802
this is our income now, okay?

1:06:57.835 --> 1:06:59.737
No, it's just, like,
this stuff is good.

1:06:59.771 --> 1:07:00.905
It's Jesus.

1:07:04.608 --> 1:07:06.243
Hey, this is Ben.

1:07:06.276 --> 1:07:08.245
Yeah.

1:07:08.278 --> 1:07:11.281
Oh, yeah, no. Yeah,
we were just talking about that.

1:07:11.314 --> 1:07:12.950
Absolutely.

1:07:12.984 --> 1:07:15.419
Yeah, I get it.
Oh, it makes sense.

1:07:15.452 --> 1:07:17.421
Okay. Yeah, for sure.

1:07:17.454 --> 1:07:18.923
All right, bye-bye.

1:07:18.956 --> 1:07:20.457
We gonna delete the video.

1:07:20.490 --> 1:07:21.793
That was Packer Tools,

1:07:21.826 --> 1:07:23.661
and, uh,
they don't like Jesus, either.

1:07:23.695 --> 1:07:25.595
So we got to get this thing...

1:07:25.629 --> 1:07:27.364
Where's this at?

1:07:27.397 --> 1:07:29.499
Okay.

1:07:29.533 --> 1:07:31.501
- It's still not deleting.
- I know it's not deleting.

1:07:31.535 --> 1:07:33.905
I'm-I'm trying to get this thing...

1:07:33.938 --> 1:07:35.405
Why is it saying "system error"?

1:07:35.439 --> 1:07:36.741
Well, why is it saying
"system error"?

1:07:36.774 --> 1:07:37.909
- I don't...
- That's what I just asked.

1:07:37.942 --> 1:07:38.943
- The same doggone question.
- Okay, but call somebody.

1:07:38.976 --> 1:07:41.278
- Call who?
- I mean, I can try to reroute it.

1:07:41.311 --> 1:07:42.646
But is it just this one video?

1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:43.981
- Yes.
- The, uh, "Selfie Dad goes

1:07:44.015 --> 1:07:46.017
- all in for the Bible?"
- Yes, that one. Yes.

1:07:46.050 --> 1:07:47.785
That's great, man.
When'd you post it?

1:07:47.819 --> 1:07:49.553
I don't know. Last night, dude.

1:07:49.586 --> 1:07:51.254
You... This ain't...
This not funny.

1:07:51.288 --> 1:07:52.924
No, I didn't mean that.
I mean, I think it's...

1:07:52.957 --> 1:07:54.458
I just think it's really cool,
you know?

1:07:54.491 --> 1:07:56.326
- Chainbreaker lives.
- Okay. Listen, dude,

1:07:56.359 --> 1:07:57.561
the chainbreaker lives,
but my page

1:07:57.594 --> 1:07:58.696
- is dying.
- What is a chainbreaker?

1:07:58.730 --> 1:08:00.564
I don't know, just...
Come on, fix the thing, dude.

1:08:00.597 --> 1:08:01.999
Call some server people
or something.

1:08:02.033 --> 1:08:03.768
- You speak their language, right?
- Yeah, I can try,

1:08:03.801 --> 1:08:04.836
but I don't know
if that's gonna...

1:08:04.869 --> 1:08:06.871
Oh, wait, hold on.
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1:08:06.904 --> 1:08:09.339
Yeah. Yes. Delete, delete.

1:08:09.372 --> 1:08:10.875
- Delete.
- Okay, now... - Yes.

1:08:10.908 --> 1:08:13.276
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, now go check and see...

1:08:13.310 --> 1:08:15.980
See how many subscribers we got.
Refresh. Subscribers.

1:08:18.348 --> 1:08:21.318
Oh, no.

1:08:21.351 --> 1:08:22.854
So, yeah,
I heard it a hundred times

1:08:22.887 --> 1:08:26.356
and acted the part,
but I wasn't saved.

1:08:26.389 --> 1:08:28.793
Pretty much a jerk, actually.

1:08:28.826 --> 1:08:30.594
I do not believe that.

1:08:30.627 --> 1:08:31.796
Oh, no. No, it's true.

1:08:31.829 --> 1:08:33.731
See, my mind was made up

1:08:33.765 --> 1:08:35.432
that I wasn't that bad,
you know?

1:08:35.465 --> 1:08:37.601
- I'm a good person.
- You are.

1:08:37.634 --> 1:08:40.403
No, yeah.

1:08:40.437 --> 1:08:43.473
Yeah, so,
I told that to my youth pastor,

1:08:43.507 --> 1:08:45.375
and I'll never forget
what he said.

1:08:45.408 --> 1:08:47.644
He said that if I took
all my thoughts...

1:08:47.678 --> 1:08:48.980
the past day,

1:08:49.013 --> 1:08:51.314
month, the year...
and projected it

1:08:51.348 --> 1:08:54.752
onto a big screen for all
my friends and family to see,

1:08:54.786 --> 1:08:58.890
would I still say
that I'm a good person?

1:08:58.923 --> 1:09:00.892
And that was like...

1:09:00.925 --> 1:09:03.493
That-that shut me up fast.

1:09:03.527 --> 1:09:05.930
But it wasn't until I was 16

1:09:05.963 --> 1:09:07.597
and I got in trouble

1:09:07.631 --> 1:09:10.935
for stealing beer at a Walmart.

1:09:10.968 --> 1:09:13.938
My mom picked me up
from the police station.

1:09:13.971 --> 1:09:16.741
The whole car ride home,
I'm just thinking to myself,

1:09:16.774 --> 1:09:18.743
"My dad's gonna kill me.

1:09:18.776 --> 1:09:20.878
He's gonna kill me."

1:09:20.912 --> 1:09:24.347
And when he gets home,
he tells me to get in the car.

1:09:24.381 --> 1:09:26.550
And he takes me out for pizza.

1:09:26.583 --> 1:09:28.618
We talk.

1:09:28.653 --> 1:09:31.656
Then he takes me back
to that same Walmart...

1:09:33.658 --> 1:09:35.726
...and he buys me an iPod.

1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:38.328
Why would he buy you an iPod?

1:09:39.163 --> 1:09:41.999
Because he wanted to teach me

1:09:42.033 --> 1:09:46.503
something bigger than just,
you know, "don't steal."

1:09:46.536 --> 1:09:49.539
He wanted to show me
that that...

1:09:49.573 --> 1:09:52.877
That that's what
God's grace looks like.

1:09:52.910 --> 1:09:56.047
That even when
I deserved punishment,

1:09:56.080 --> 1:09:59.382
I got reward.

1:09:59.416 --> 1:10:02.419
And I saw for the first time
that that's...

1:10:03.754 --> 1:10:06.123
Well, that's what Jesus did.

1:10:06.157 --> 1:10:08.993
He paid the ultimate price,

1:10:09.026 --> 1:10:11.762
so I could be
with Him in Heaven.

1:10:14.464 --> 1:10:16.868
I changed my life.

1:10:16.901 --> 1:10:18.970
For good and...

1:10:19.003 --> 1:10:21.571
five years later I felt
the call to full ministry

1:10:21.605 --> 1:10:24.041
and that's what
I'm studying in school.

1:10:24.075 --> 1:10:25.977
You are so amazing.

1:10:26.010 --> 1:10:27.477
Thanks.

1:10:27.510 --> 1:10:29.046
Hmm.

1:10:30.948 --> 1:10:32.649
So...

1:10:32.683 --> 1:10:34.118
So wack.

1:10:34.151 --> 1:10:35.953
Here I come.

1:10:35.987 --> 1:10:37.989
Hey, you should come with me
to check out the computer.

1:10:38.022 --> 1:10:39.190
- What?
- Yeah.

1:10:39.223 --> 1:10:40.557
I'm gonna go help.

1:10:40.590 --> 1:10:42.760
No, no, no, you can help me

1:10:42.793 --> 1:10:44.128
clean up.

1:10:45.763 --> 1:10:47.732
Dude, I would think you
of all people

1:10:47.765 --> 1:10:48.966
would appreciate the fact that

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.468
- I did a video about the Bible.
- Yeah.

1:10:51.501 --> 1:10:53.070
I love it.

1:10:53.104 --> 1:10:55.907
All right, but...
in all fairness to your fans,

1:10:55.940 --> 1:10:59.377
you went from, like,
zero to 60 in one day.

1:11:00.778 --> 1:11:02.579
What if your page dropping...

1:11:02.612 --> 1:11:04.648
what if it's a test?

1:11:04.682 --> 1:11:06.583
Test,
what are you talking about?

1:11:06.616 --> 1:11:09.053
To see if you really believe

1:11:09.086 --> 1:11:11.656
everything you're reading.

1:11:11.689 --> 1:11:14.591
I mean, could God have
made your page double?

1:11:14.624 --> 1:11:16.626
Could He have made it so you
could delete it right away?

1:11:16.661 --> 1:11:17.728
Of course.

1:11:17.762 --> 1:11:19.730
Look, man...

1:11:19.764 --> 1:11:21.732
the more you're in His Word,

1:11:21.766 --> 1:11:23.466
the more you're gonna have
to decide whether or not

1:11:23.500 --> 1:11:24.902
you believe in Him
and trust Him.

1:11:24.936 --> 1:11:26.771
But I still got
to make a living.

1:11:26.804 --> 1:11:28.205
Look, totally.

1:11:28.239 --> 1:11:30.473
He'll never leave you.

1:11:30.507 --> 1:11:33.543
Take God at His Word
and that's...

1:11:33.576 --> 1:11:37.682
and that's
God Himself talking to you.

1:11:41.252 --> 1:11:43.988
Why are these people not asleep?

1:11:48.159 --> 1:11:51.062
Go to sleep
and stop unsubscribing.

1:11:52.964 --> 1:11:55.465
Ben, go to sleep.

1:12:11.082 --> 1:12:13.084
Oh, no.

1:12:18.956 --> 1:12:20.590
What are you doing?

1:12:20.623 --> 1:12:23.094
Oh, nothing, I couldn't sleep.

1:12:23.127 --> 1:12:25.196
Uh, I just was...

1:12:25.229 --> 1:12:27.999
walking around, I guess, uh...

1:12:30.735 --> 1:12:33.170
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1:12:33.204 --> 1:12:35.106
You weren't...

1:12:35.139 --> 1:12:37.808
you weren't checking up
on me, were you?

1:12:38.876 --> 1:12:40.945
No, I wasn't checking on you.

1:12:40.978 --> 1:12:42.279
'Cause why would I do that?

1:12:42.313 --> 1:12:45.149
When, you know,
the guy from the play, he...

1:12:45.182 --> 1:12:47.284
he's still a massive loser,
right?

1:12:47.318 --> 1:12:49.086
Mm-hmm.

1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:50.620
- Okay.
- Night.

1:12:50.654 --> 1:12:51.889
Yeah, good night.

1:12:51.922 --> 1:12:53.924
Hey, um...

1:12:53.958 --> 1:12:55.259
You know what,
wait right there for a second.

1:12:55.292 --> 1:12:57.094
Just-just one sec.
Just wait right there.

1:13:04.634 --> 1:13:06.270
Got that for you.

1:13:06.303 --> 1:13:07.738
What's this?

1:13:07.772 --> 1:13:09.073
The book, it...

1:13:09.106 --> 1:13:11.075
Mickey wanted you
to have it, so...

1:13:11.108 --> 1:13:13.010
You can read it right now.

1:13:13.044 --> 1:13:15.146
It's the middle
of the night, Dad.

1:13:15.179 --> 1:13:17.681
Yeah, okay.

1:13:17.715 --> 1:13:20.084
So, the morning.
You can read it in the morning.

1:13:20.117 --> 1:13:22.153
- I can set your alarm, if you want me to.
- Mm-hmm.

1:13:22.186 --> 1:13:24.321
Hey, listen, uh,

1:13:24.355 --> 1:13:26.724
you know, Mickey's...

1:13:26.757 --> 1:13:28.192
He's a little old for you.

1:13:28.225 --> 1:13:29.760
Okay?

1:13:29.794 --> 1:13:31.628
What are you talking about?

1:13:32.897 --> 1:13:34.999
Well, I want you to know
that, uh,

1:13:35.032 --> 1:13:38.235
he's the type of guy
who deserves someone like you.

1:13:39.270 --> 1:13:41.372
Okay.

1:13:41.405 --> 1:13:43.240
Hanns, one more thing.

1:13:43.274 --> 1:13:45.276
One more thing. Uh...

1:13:45.309 --> 1:13:47.211
I'm your dad,

1:13:47.244 --> 1:13:49.013
and I want you to know

1:13:49.046 --> 1:13:51.315
that I am hopelessly devoted
to you.

1:13:51.348 --> 1:13:54.118
Of all the daughters
in the world,

1:13:54.151 --> 1:13:56.120
you're the one that I want.

1:13:56.153 --> 1:13:58.189
Mm-hmm.

1:13:58.222 --> 1:13:59.924
Good night.

1:14:03.227 --> 1:14:05.729
<i>♪ You're the one that I want ♪</i>

1:14:05.763 --> 1:14:07.731
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh. ♪</i>

1:14:10.367 --> 1:14:11.936
Okay. I'm-a pray.

1:14:11.969 --> 1:14:14.105
So, numbers are down.

1:14:14.138 --> 1:14:16.173
It's okay,
'cause I'm-a pray.

1:14:16.207 --> 1:14:17.775
We're gonna work this out,

1:14:17.808 --> 1:14:18.976
'cause I pray.

1:14:19.009 --> 1:14:20.077
That's what I do.

1:14:21.779 --> 1:14:23.948
I could fix, uh,

1:14:23.981 --> 1:14:25.883
a garage door opener.

1:14:25.916 --> 1:14:27.685
That's what I could do.
I could fix that.

1:14:27.718 --> 1:14:29.053
Yep. I could fix that.

1:14:29.086 --> 1:14:30.754
I could fix a hot water heater.

1:14:30.788 --> 1:14:33.224
I'll make a video of fixing
the hot water heater.

1:14:33.257 --> 1:14:35.359
'Cause I pray, and I'm praying.

1:14:35.392 --> 1:14:37.828
I'm-a pray that Packer Tools
understands this.

1:14:37.862 --> 1:14:39.697
I'm-a pray
that my numbers go back up.

1:14:39.730 --> 1:14:42.700
And I'm-a pray, 'cause that's
what I'm doing right now.

1:14:42.733 --> 1:14:43.834
Or am I?

1:14:43.868 --> 1:14:46.770
'Cause it feels like I'm
in a garage talking to myself.

1:14:46.804 --> 1:14:48.305
That's okay.

1:14:48.339 --> 1:14:49.740
I'm...

1:14:50.741 --> 1:14:52.743
Okay.

1:14:56.447 --> 1:14:59.016
<i>Hey, Ben, it's, uh,
Laurie with LaughLoud.</i>

1:14:59.049 --> 1:15:01.185
<i>Just thought
I'd leave you a message.</i>

1:15:01.218 --> 1:15:04.255
<i>I'd still love to interview you
about your big win.</i>

1:15:04.288 --> 1:15:05.990
<i>I'll be in town
the week of the ninth.</i>

1:15:06.023 --> 1:15:07.992
<i>So let me know
if you have any free time.</i>

1:15:08.025 --> 1:15:11.195
<i>Also, not sure
if you got the photo I sent.</i>

1:15:11.228 --> 1:15:13.697
<i>Hope you like red.</i>

1:15:24.808 --> 1:15:25.576
Hey.

1:15:25.609 --> 1:15:27.912
Everything okay?

1:15:27.945 --> 1:15:29.380
I'm good. Uh...

1:15:29.413 --> 1:15:31.849
Selfie Dad
is gonna probably be fixing

1:15:31.882 --> 1:15:33.717
a-a cell phone that's broken.

1:15:33.751 --> 1:15:35.286
And I got to try to break it.

1:15:35.319 --> 1:15:37.154
- It didn't work that time, but I'm-a get it.
- Okay.

1:15:37.188 --> 1:15:38.856
Well, we're leaving. I thought
you'd want to say goodbye

1:15:38.889 --> 1:15:40.457
- to the kids.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

1:15:40.491 --> 1:15:43.194
I'm-a say goodbye...
say goodbye to 'em.

1:15:43.227 --> 1:15:44.261
I'm-a go with you.

1:15:44.295 --> 1:15:46.263
No, you-you should go
before I go.

1:15:46.297 --> 1:15:48.165
Go before me.
That's what...

1:15:48.199 --> 1:15:49.433
The Bible says that sometimes.

1:15:49.466 --> 1:15:51.869
- So, if you... Yeah.
- Okay.

1:15:51.902 --> 1:15:52.870
Okay.

1:15:59.043 --> 1:15:59.944
Hey, buddy.

1:15:59.977 --> 1:16:01.345
You're going to school today
and stuff,

1:16:01.378 --> 1:16:03.080
so, uh, I just wanted to say,

1:16:03.113 --> 1:16:05.282
you know, uh,
go hit it hard, okay?

1:16:05.316 --> 1:16:06.884
Yeah. You, too.

1:16:06.917 --> 1:16:08.018
You'd better.

1:16:08.052 --> 1:16:11.488
'Cause you just dropped
two-fifths of your subscribers.

1:16:11.522 --> 1:16:13.891
Fractions.

1:16:13.924 --> 1:16:15.459
Hannah, come on.

1:16:16.493 --> 1:16:18.195
Hey, Hanns.

1:16:18.229 --> 1:16:20.464
So, uh, you know I gave you
that book last night?

1:16:20.497 --> 1:16:23.267
I just... I think it's important
that you, um...

1:16:36.981 --> 1:16:39.283
You're not gonna make any videos
without me, right?

1:16:39.316 --> 1:16:41.151
Dude, you're my editor.

1:16:45.189 --> 1:16:47.558
So cool.

1:16:49.126 --> 1:16:52.029
What in the world is going on?

1:17:12.950 --> 1:17:15.286
What I'm not gonna do is
I'm not...

1:17:15.319 --> 1:17:17.921
I'm not gonna be my dad.

1:17:28.999 --> 1:17:31.101
Laurie,

1:17:31.135 --> 1:17:35.272
I've deleted your photo.

1:17:37.308 --> 1:17:42.046
My family is too important.

1:17:43.080 --> 1:17:45.349
And...

1:17:45.382 --> 1:17:48.952
I love...

1:17:48.986 --> 1:17:50.888
my wife.

1:17:50.921 --> 1:17:53.090
Please do not...

1:17:53.123 --> 1:17:55.926
contact me.

1:18:07.438 --> 1:18:08.872
Gary, this is ridiculous.

1:18:08.906 --> 1:18:10.274
You could've just called me
on the phone.

1:18:10.307 --> 1:18:12.543
You got to slap me
with this junk.

1:18:12.576 --> 1:18:14.144
Well, I don't have the money.

1:18:14.178 --> 1:18:16.246
And even if I did,
we had a deal.

1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:17.281
You could sue me.
You know what?

1:18:17.314 --> 1:18:20.250
And I'm-a sue you
for-for trying to sue people

1:18:20.284 --> 1:18:21.585
when you shouldn't be suing 'em
and stuff.

1:18:23.220 --> 1:18:25.122
Gary.

1:18:25.155 --> 1:18:27.124
<i>Gary.</i>

1:18:31.428 --> 1:18:33.897
That was Gary.

1:18:37.468 --> 1:18:38.902
They just...

1:18:38.936 --> 1:18:40.904
they just canceled my deal.

1:18:40.938 --> 1:18:43.640
Packer Tools.
They canceled it.

1:18:43.675 --> 1:18:45.275
What?

1:18:45.309 --> 1:18:48.178
Apparently, they don't like
religious content.

1:18:48.212 --> 1:18:50.247
- Yeah, but you deleted the video.
- I know I deleted the video.

1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:53.117
I'm just telling you
what they said.

1:18:53.150 --> 1:18:55.386
<i>No tenemos el dinero.</i>

1:18:55.419 --> 1:18:57.354
Ben, we don't have this money!

1:19:00.958 --> 1:19:02.459
What are you doing?

1:19:02.493 --> 1:19:04.128
What does it look
like I'm doing?

1:19:04.161 --> 1:19:06.597
Well, I think we should,
uh, go talk about this.

1:19:06.630 --> 1:19:07.665
What is there to talk about?

1:19:07.699 --> 1:19:10.534
Packer Tools wants to play
this game? Well, fine.

1:19:10.567 --> 1:19:13.137
Sweetheart, I don't think
you're in your right mindset.

1:19:13.170 --> 1:19:14.605
You don't get it.

1:19:14.638 --> 1:19:17.474
I am always
in the right mindset.

1:19:17.508 --> 1:19:20.978
Ever since I was five years old,
I've been in the right mindset.

1:19:21.011 --> 1:19:22.413
I just happened to have a dad

1:19:22.446 --> 1:19:24.415
who didn't know
what he was doing.

1:19:24.448 --> 1:19:26.950
And for 20 years,
that set me back.

1:19:26.984 --> 1:19:29.219
But not anymore. And I'm
not gonna let this one mistake

1:19:29.253 --> 1:19:30.621
keep this opportunity from me.

1:19:30.655 --> 1:19:32.289
I'm in my right mindset.

1:19:32.322 --> 1:19:34.024
In fact, let's do a video

1:19:34.057 --> 1:19:35.959
so I can show you
I'm in my right mindset.

1:19:35.993 --> 1:19:37.227
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:19:37.261 --> 1:19:38.495
Pick a topic.

1:19:38.529 --> 1:19:39.731
Can we please go inside

1:19:39.764 --> 1:19:41.298
and talk about this
for a minute?

1:19:41.331 --> 1:19:42.966
Perfect. I probably wouldn't
have picked that one,

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:44.201
but that's what we're gonna do.

1:19:46.003 --> 1:19:47.471
Hello. This is Selfie Dad.

1:19:47.504 --> 1:19:50.340
And today I'm-a show you
how to go inside

1:19:50.374 --> 1:19:52.276
and talk about it for a minute
with your wife.

1:19:52.309 --> 1:19:55.546
First thing you want to do
is you need to have a wife.

1:19:55.579 --> 1:19:58.683
Don't let her show you how much
you don't want to go inside.

1:19:58.716 --> 1:20:01.653
'Cause who wants to go inside
anyway?

1:20:02.654 --> 1:20:04.221
Okay, okay. Not that one.

1:20:04.254 --> 1:20:05.657
Wait.

1:20:09.359 --> 1:20:11.261
Hey, yo, Selfie Dad here.

1:20:11.295 --> 1:20:13.665
And when your wife says,
"You want to go inside?"

1:20:13.698 --> 1:20:15.599
you better watch out,
'cause you know what happens

1:20:15.632 --> 1:20:16.734
when you go inside, right?

1:20:16.768 --> 1:20:18.335
You end up going outside,

1:20:18.368 --> 1:20:20.571
'cause she's a little loose
on the inside.

1:20:20.604 --> 1:20:23.574
Uh-huh, I'm just, this is...
You know what?

1:20:23.607 --> 1:20:25.743
'Cause I'm Selfie...

1:20:29.046 --> 1:20:32.049
- Aah!
- Oh, my goodness!

1:20:32.082 --> 1:20:33.550
Oh. Are you okay?

1:20:33.584 --> 1:20:34.786
Yeah, I'm good.

1:20:34.819 --> 1:20:36.721
- Well, can I...
- I'm good. No, no, I'm good.

1:20:36.754 --> 1:20:38.088
What happened?

1:20:38.121 --> 1:20:39.223
Aah! I'm-I'm good.

1:20:39.256 --> 1:20:40.792
Packer Tools is junk!

1:20:40.825 --> 1:20:42.727
Packer Tools
is junk!

1:20:42.760 --> 1:20:43.795
Ooh, you don't like Jesus.

1:20:43.828 --> 1:20:46.029
Well, you know what?
I hope Jesus don't like you.

1:20:49.166 --> 1:20:50.702
Oh, you gonna tailgate me?

1:20:50.735 --> 1:20:51.635
You gonna... Oh, yeah?

1:20:51.669 --> 1:20:53.705
Well, you know what,
tailgate now, bruh.

1:20:53.738 --> 1:20:56.674
How about that?

1:20:56.708 --> 1:20:57.641
The poli... Really?

1:20:57.675 --> 1:21:00.511
This is what we're doing
right now?

1:21:00.544 --> 1:21:03.313
Probably Packer Tools police
or something.

1:21:03.347 --> 1:21:05.817
Okay. First thing I need to do

1:21:05.850 --> 1:21:07.251
is calm myself down.

1:21:07.284 --> 1:21:09.586
I am getting pulled over
by the police.

1:21:09.620 --> 1:21:12.456
Okay, make a... make a video,
that's what I'm-a do.

1:21:12.489 --> 1:21:14.692
Make sure this angle
on this camera,

1:21:14.726 --> 1:21:16.093
so they could see both of us.

1:21:16.126 --> 1:21:17.695
I got to make a video
for two reasons.

1:21:17.729 --> 1:21:19.062
One, 'cause I'm Selfie Dad.

1:21:19.096 --> 1:21:20.665
Number two...

1:21:20.698 --> 1:21:23.100
I need to make sure
things is safe.

1:21:23.133 --> 1:21:24.769
When the police officer
rolls up,

1:21:24.802 --> 1:21:27.237
make sure that you don't have
more bass than them.

1:21:27.271 --> 1:21:28.773
Try to take all the bass
out your voice.

1:21:28.806 --> 1:21:30.407
Hello, Officer.

1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:31.475
Hello, Officer.

1:21:31.508 --> 1:21:33.410
You need to put the hands
on the steering wheel,

1:21:33.443 --> 1:21:34.578
or they're going
behind your back.

1:21:34.611 --> 1:21:35.847
So we got to work this out.

1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:37.281
Got to work this out. Okay.

1:21:38.448 --> 1:21:41.753
Also, no immediate
eye contact. Mm-mm.

1:21:41.786 --> 1:21:43.420
Only thing turning is
your eyeballs.

1:21:43.453 --> 1:21:45.690
You just don't even move.
Here he come, here he come.

1:21:45.723 --> 1:21:47.792
You're not bad. Breathe.

1:21:47.825 --> 1:21:49.293
Afternoon, sir.

1:21:49.326 --> 1:21:52.195
Hello, Officer.

1:21:52.229 --> 1:21:53.865
H-Hello, Officer.

1:21:53.898 --> 1:21:55.265
How are you?

1:21:55.299 --> 1:21:56.366
Good.

1:21:56.400 --> 1:21:57.634
Clocked you doing 81.

1:21:57.669 --> 1:21:59.269
I'm gonna need to see
your license,

1:21:59.303 --> 1:22:00.537
registration
and proof of insurance.

1:22:00.571 --> 1:22:02.139
Ha-ha!

1:22:02.172 --> 1:22:04.474
It's a...
I thought it was the po-lice.

1:22:04.508 --> 1:22:06.176
It's the bro-lice.

1:22:06.209 --> 1:22:07.177
We gonna be a'ight.

1:22:07.210 --> 1:22:08.680
Ha-ha! What's up, dawg?

1:22:08.713 --> 1:22:10.647
Hey, who your people?

1:22:10.682 --> 1:22:13.517
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

1:22:13.550 --> 1:22:14.852
We went to school together
or something, right?

1:22:14.886 --> 1:22:16.754
No. No,
didn't go to school together.

1:22:16.788 --> 1:22:18.723
Can I see your license, please?

1:22:18.756 --> 1:22:20.892
I thought it was the...

1:22:20.925 --> 1:22:23.193
It's not the bro-lice after all.

1:22:23.226 --> 1:22:24.628
It's... Yeah.

1:22:24.662 --> 1:22:25.697
Let me get it for you. Cool.

1:22:25.730 --> 1:22:28.165
- You know, have you ever seen me before?
- No.

1:22:28.198 --> 1:22:29.433
I haven't seen you before,

1:22:29.466 --> 1:22:31.234
but I will when you give me
your license,

1:22:31.268 --> 1:22:32.536
your registration
and proof of insurance.

1:22:32.569 --> 1:22:34.171
I'm not gonna
keep saying it, sir.

1:22:34.204 --> 1:22:35.639
All right,
calm yourself down, bruh.

1:22:35.673 --> 1:22:38.241
Hey, I got a Selfie Dad mug.
You want a Selfie Dad mug?

1:22:38.275 --> 1:22:39.877
- You drink coffee, right?
- Are you trying to bribe me, sir?

1:22:39.911 --> 1:22:43.180
No, I know you like doughnuts.
I got some coffee or something.

1:22:43.213 --> 1:22:45.817
- You get a mug... Okay, let me get it for you real quick.
- Hey, sir?

1:22:45.850 --> 1:22:47.652
- Keep your hands on the steering wheel, please.
- I'm-a show you

1:22:47.685 --> 1:22:48.585
- this thing real quick. What? What?
- Hey!

1:22:48.619 --> 1:22:50.554
I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car.

1:22:50.587 --> 1:22:52.489
- Aah! No!
- Hey!

1:22:52.522 --> 1:22:54.726
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1:22:59.697 --> 1:23:02.132
Marcus. Your ride's here.

1:23:05.903 --> 1:23:07.537
<i>Rough day?</i>

1:23:07.571 --> 1:23:09.741
Uh, you could say that.

1:23:10.908 --> 1:23:12.609
Hey, where's my car?

1:23:12.643 --> 1:23:14.746
The impound lot.
I'll drive you.

1:23:15.780 --> 1:23:18.348
So, now what, Mr. Miyagi?

1:23:18.382 --> 1:23:20.818
I guess we just, uh...

1:23:20.852 --> 1:23:23.387
need a big finish for my paper.

1:23:24.856 --> 1:23:26.623
"Big finish for my paper"?

1:23:26.658 --> 1:23:28.425
<i>Dude, I don't know,</i>

1:23:28.458 --> 1:23:30.862
man, I just feel like I've blown
it one too many times, man,

1:23:30.895 --> 1:23:34.297
and I...
probably gonna blow it again.

1:23:34.331 --> 1:23:37.334
When your kids mess up,
do you ever stop loving them?

1:23:37.367 --> 1:23:40.437
No, of course not.

1:23:40.470 --> 1:23:42.406
You will always love them,
no matter what,

1:23:42.439 --> 1:23:43.941
because that's
what a good father does.

1:23:43.975 --> 1:23:46.209
And God is the perfect Father.

1:23:46.243 --> 1:23:49.781
And when you're His child,
He loves you no matter what.

1:23:49.814 --> 1:23:53.550
Give Him your whole life.
Confess your sins.

1:23:53.583 --> 1:23:55.920
And if you feel
you went wrong with people,

1:23:55.953 --> 1:23:57.521
confess it to them.

1:23:57.554 --> 1:24:00.257
You study the Word
and know the Word,

1:24:00.290 --> 1:24:02.292
and the more you live it out...

1:24:02.325 --> 1:24:04.461
the more you're gonna find
that real thing

1:24:04.494 --> 1:24:05.997
that you've been looking for.

1:24:06.030 --> 1:24:08.365
What's that?

1:24:08.398 --> 1:24:09.967
Peace.

1:24:22.646 --> 1:24:25.282
<i>I've been looking
at stuff online</i>

1:24:25.315 --> 1:24:27.919
that I shouldn't.

1:24:27.952 --> 1:24:29.821
Oh.

1:24:29.854 --> 1:24:32.489
And Rosie fired me,
but I really...

1:24:32.522 --> 1:24:34.458
I probably deserved it.

1:24:36.961 --> 1:24:38.930
The other night...

1:24:38.963 --> 1:24:40.965
at the awards show...

1:24:44.601 --> 1:24:46.838
So, there was
this lady named Laurie...

1:24:46.871 --> 1:24:48.405
and nothing happened.

1:24:48.438 --> 1:24:51.308
I know.
I saw the text she sent you.

1:24:54.746 --> 1:24:58.548
That you texted her
that your family comes first.

1:25:01.418 --> 1:25:05.622
And that she shouldn't
contact you anymore.

1:25:08.793 --> 1:25:12.295
I prayed for you
that whole night.

1:25:18.035 --> 1:25:20.905
Okay. Um...

1:25:20.938 --> 1:25:22.073
Wow.

1:25:22.106 --> 1:25:24.541
Um...

1:25:26.643 --> 1:25:28.411
Okay, well,
there's one more thing.

1:25:28.445 --> 1:25:31.916
You know when we go to Costco,
and I act like

1:25:31.949 --> 1:25:34.551
I'm actually gonna buy
something from the samples?

1:25:34.584 --> 1:25:36.419
I'm just...
I just want the samples.

1:25:36.453 --> 1:25:37.755
I'm not gonna...

1:25:37.789 --> 1:25:39.690
I-I forgive you for everything.

1:25:39.724 --> 1:25:41.558
So delicious, the little...

1:25:41.591 --> 1:25:42.827
Oh, oh!

1:25:42.860 --> 1:25:45.096
Yeah.

1:25:45.129 --> 1:25:47.698
<i>That's why you're here?</i>

1:25:47.732 --> 1:25:49.700
Yeah, man, I just had to
get it off my chest.

1:25:49.734 --> 1:25:51.869
I did a lot of personal stuff
on work time, so...

1:25:51.903 --> 1:25:54.071
Oh, I heard you the first time.

1:25:54.105 --> 1:25:56.007
I've just never known
anybody to admit that.

1:25:56.040 --> 1:25:59.076
Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm
sorry and, you know, thank you.

1:25:59.110 --> 1:26:00.443
I appreciate it.

1:26:00.477 --> 1:26:02.445
Oh, wait.

1:26:04.614 --> 1:26:06.083
This is yours.

1:26:06.117 --> 1:26:07.652
I accepted it for you.

1:26:09.020 --> 1:26:11.122
You know, Rosie never shuts up
about you now.

1:26:11.155 --> 1:26:13.590
She chased Richard off,
and whoever I bring in,

1:26:13.623 --> 1:26:15.458
she just compares them to you.

1:26:15.492 --> 1:26:18.029
But I told her that you were on
to bigger and better things.

1:26:18.062 --> 1:26:19.831
Am I right?

1:26:29.173 --> 1:26:31.374
How'd it go?

1:26:33.778 --> 1:26:35.412
What is that?

1:26:35.445 --> 1:26:38.082
Uh, the number one
reality show editor.

1:26:38.115 --> 1:26:41.686
My award-winning husband.

1:26:41.719 --> 1:26:45.690
And... Steve offered me
my job back.

1:26:45.723 --> 1:26:47.557
Are you serious?

1:26:47.591 --> 1:26:50.761
Then, he goes to legal

1:26:50.795 --> 1:26:54.031
and has them look at
my Packer contract.

1:26:54.065 --> 1:26:56.033
All they can do is
stop future payments.

1:26:56.067 --> 1:26:57.768
They can't ask for
any money in return.

1:26:57.802 --> 1:27:00.071
Oh, wow.

1:27:01.806 --> 1:27:06.110
Are you gonna... take your job?

1:27:06.143 --> 1:27:08.012
Yeah.

1:27:08.045 --> 1:27:11.782
But here is the craziest part.

1:27:13.851 --> 1:27:17.554
Steve actually hinted that
they may have some interest

1:27:17.587 --> 1:27:19.824
in doing a Selfie Dad TV show.

1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:24.662
But here's the thing.

1:27:24.695 --> 1:27:28.766
I'm cool with editing
or doing comedy or a TV show.

1:27:28.799 --> 1:27:33.204
I only want to do
what God asks me to do.

1:27:33.237 --> 1:27:36.140
And my family comes first,

1:27:36.173 --> 1:27:39.043
'cause I know that's what
He wants.

1:27:39.076 --> 1:27:41.544
So I'm good either way.

1:27:41.578 --> 1:27:42.880
I'm good.

1:27:42.914 --> 1:27:45.816
I mean... <i>we're</i> good.

1:27:45.850 --> 1:27:49.020
You're home.
It's blowing up.

1:27:49.053 --> 1:27:51.155
It's going bigger than
the toilet video.

1:27:51.188 --> 1:27:53.157
<i>You know what,
'cause I'm Selfie...</i>

1:27:53.190 --> 1:27:55.726
I can't believe you posted this.

1:27:57.828 --> 1:27:59.196
- <i>Aah!</i>
- <i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

1:27:59.230 --> 1:28:01.799
- It looked so real.
- Heh.

1:28:01.832 --> 1:28:04.001
You know what, I'm a good actor.

1:28:04.035 --> 1:28:06.671
You've got one-ninth
of your subscribers back.

1:28:06.704 --> 1:28:09.040
You're not mad at me?

1:28:09.073 --> 1:28:12.109
What, for posting this video?

1:28:12.143 --> 1:28:13.978
Dude, nah.
Give me a hug, man.

1:28:14.011 --> 1:28:16.914
Ow. Wait, dude. Hold on.

1:28:16.948 --> 1:28:18.716
You know what...

1:28:20.985 --> 1:28:22.820
This is awkward.

1:28:22.853 --> 1:28:24.889
Oh, I love these orchids.

1:28:24.922 --> 1:28:27.858
They will add such elegance
to your garden.

1:28:27.892 --> 1:28:29.093
They always do.

1:28:29.126 --> 1:28:31.028
And if you plant a white orchid,

1:28:31.062 --> 1:28:34.065
that means forgiveness.

1:28:34.098 --> 1:28:37.201
<i>This is</i> Rosie's Roses.

1:28:37.234 --> 1:28:39.804
<i>You keep planting,
and keep loving.</i>

1:28:41.706 --> 1:28:43.240
Thoughts?

1:28:45.242 --> 1:28:48.079
Well, I've... I've seen better.

1:28:48.112 --> 1:28:49.880
But at least you
got it in on time.

1:28:49.914 --> 1:28:52.582
This time, I'm saying.

1:28:52.615 --> 1:28:55.518
Yes. So, there's that.

1:28:57.154 --> 1:28:58.521
Well, I can't think of anything

1:28:58.555 --> 1:28:59.857
off the top of my head
right now.

1:28:59.890 --> 1:29:01.524
Good. Great job.

1:29:01.558 --> 1:29:03.861
Cool. Wait. Whoa, whoa,
before you go, hold on.

1:29:03.894 --> 1:29:06.230
Uh, I got something for you.

1:29:07.965 --> 1:29:08.933
Welcome back.

1:29:08.966 --> 1:29:10.801
Men are so strange.

1:29:10.835 --> 1:29:12.870
Yes, you're just...

1:29:12.903 --> 1:29:14.772
Just-just there.

1:29:14.805 --> 1:29:17.675
That's-that's what you do.

1:29:19.243 --> 1:29:20.711
Oh, hush.

1:30:06.190 --> 1:30:08.292
No, without a doubt,
the best part has been

1:30:08.325 --> 1:30:09.894
getting to know you guys.

1:30:09.927 --> 1:30:12.129
You are such a gem.

1:30:12.163 --> 1:30:14.597
- We're gonna miss you, Mickey.
- Yeah.

1:30:14.631 --> 1:30:16.100
Well, hey, I can still
come visit.

1:30:16.133 --> 1:30:17.368
You know, maybe you guys can

1:30:17.401 --> 1:30:20.104
make a trip up to Seattle
sometime.

1:30:20.137 --> 1:30:22.873
Sounds good, man.

1:30:22.907 --> 1:30:25.142
And, Hannah, maybe you and...
maybe you and your dad

1:30:25.176 --> 1:30:26.844
could read that
little book together.

1:30:26.877 --> 1:30:28.645
- We have been.
- Yeah, dude, I...

1:30:28.679 --> 1:30:29.947
I owe you a lot, man.

1:30:29.980 --> 1:30:31.315
Nah, you don't owe me.

1:30:31.348 --> 1:30:34.085
And, hey, off the strength
of punching a wall,

1:30:34.118 --> 1:30:35.786
Selfie Dad's back.

1:30:35.820 --> 1:30:38.756
What are you gonna do
for your encore?

1:30:38.789 --> 1:30:40.691
Yo, Selfie Dad here.

1:30:40.724 --> 1:30:41.859
I'm excited to be back.

1:30:41.892 --> 1:30:43.294
I'm excited to be doing
another video.

1:30:43.327 --> 1:30:44.627
My hand's all good.

1:30:44.662 --> 1:30:46.297
There's a hole in the wall
like this.

1:30:46.330 --> 1:30:48.799
First of all, let me...
I want to apologize,

1:30:48.833 --> 1:30:50.968
because before,
I was saying some stuff

1:30:51.001 --> 1:30:52.203
to talk about the Bible.

1:30:52.236 --> 1:30:54.772
You just want me to be funny,
so hey, if that's the case,

1:30:54.805 --> 1:30:57.808
I'm not gonna mention
"the Bible" anymore.

1:30:57.842 --> 1:31:00.010
I've decided that the best thing
for me to do

1:31:00.044 --> 1:31:01.912
is to just, uh, call it...

1:31:01.946 --> 1:31:04.248
call it the Word of God, yeah.

1:31:04.281 --> 1:31:05.850
Anyway, I said I <i>want</i>
to apologize.

1:31:05.883 --> 1:31:07.384
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

1:31:07.418 --> 1:31:09.653
If you don't like me
talking about God's Word,

1:31:09.687 --> 1:31:11.689
then, you know, your bad.
You know?

1:31:11.722 --> 1:31:13.324
You don't gotta watch.
You can take it off...

1:31:13.357 --> 1:31:16.327
What?! That's it?

1:31:16.360 --> 1:31:19.797
Hey, what are you doing here?

1:31:19.830 --> 1:31:22.266
I'm Selfie Daughter...
by the way.

1:31:22.299 --> 1:31:23.467
Selfie <i>Daughter.</i>

1:31:23.501 --> 1:31:28.038
Why don't you explain to them
why the Bible is so cool?

1:31:28.072 --> 1:31:30.074
Then they would want to
keep watching,

1:31:30.107 --> 1:31:32.143
and they might even want
to read the Bible.

1:31:32.176 --> 1:31:34.011
All right, so I'm gonna
explain to you why.

1:31:34.044 --> 1:31:38.315
Mainly because it is literally
God's Word.

1:31:38.349 --> 1:31:41.285
He left an instruction booklet
for us.

1:31:41.318 --> 1:31:43.287
Why do you think it's important?

1:31:46.390 --> 1:31:49.393
Um, because I've seen how

1:31:49.426 --> 1:31:51.729
God has changed my dad.

1:31:54.832 --> 1:31:58.102
So, the reason why
the Bible is important

1:31:58.135 --> 1:32:02.106
is because, before, I had this,
but I didn't even see it

1:32:02.139 --> 1:32:05.743
until I opened up the Bible,

1:32:05.776 --> 1:32:07.745
and then it opened me up.

1:32:07.778 --> 1:32:09.947
So I'm in.

sharper than
any two-edged sword...

Make sure everybody does it,

1:34:40.931 --> 1:34:42.466
so they can be counted.

1:34:42.499 --> 1:34:44.501

'cause that's just, like,
on your phone already.

1:34:47.971 --> 1:34:49.606
Like, bring an actual Bible
to school

1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:51.208
and then maybe crack it open.

1:34:51.241 --> 1:34:52.543

1:34:52.576 --> 1:34:53.977

1:34:54.011 --> 1:34:55.179
don't just get a Bible
and show up,

'cause that stuff is creepy.

1:34:56.413 --> 1:34:58.248
