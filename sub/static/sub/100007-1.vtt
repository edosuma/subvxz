WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:04.137
GORDON: Guys, the
views are amazing but
where's the delicacy?

00:04.538 --> 00:06.273
HARESH: D'you see
that spiny plant?

00:06.273 --> 00:08.542
GORDON: The cactus on
the edge of the cliff?

00:08.542 --> 00:10.711
HARESH: Yeah,
right off that cliff.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.914
It grows in really
dangerous places.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.584
GORDON: This is crazy.
Why aren't you coming Haresh?

00:17.584 --> 00:19.653
HARESH: I'm
afraid of heights man.

00:19.653 --> 00:20.854
GORDON: You're
afraid of heights.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.532
HARESH: Be careful.
GORDON: Bloody hell.

00:34.101 --> 00:35.602
GORDON: Yes we can.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.206
HARESH: Lean back.
Don't lean forward.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.611
GORDON: (bleep).

00:46.246 --> 00:49.683
I'm Gordon Ramsay and
I'm on an epic adventure.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.218
Taxi.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.921
Traveling to the
ends of the earth.

00:54.421 --> 00:57.424
Ditching the chef
whites and getting hands on.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.326
The things I do for food.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.828
Slow it down. Slow it down.
Where do we start?

01:01.828 --> 01:04.131
VIRGILIO: We're
gonna start up there.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.366
GORDON: Are you
trying to kill me?

01:06.366 --> 01:09.236
In search of
culinary inspiration.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.604
Let's go.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.273
Look at that beauty.
Absolutely delicious.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.443
It's like a crispy cockroach.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.479
I've learned more in
the last week than I have
in the last ten years.

01:19.479 --> 01:22.282
This is definitely
unchartered territory for me.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.586
It doesn't get any better
than that, does it?

01:33.727 --> 01:36.396
This is Peru's Sacred Valley.

01:39.132 --> 01:42.469
At towering heights of up
to 3 miles above sea level.

01:42.469 --> 01:45.772
It's a unique Andean ecosystem
whose staggering biodiversity

01:45.772 --> 01:50.143
once fed the mighty Incan
empire and now it's gonna feed

01:50.143 --> 01:53.080
a British chef
with a motorbike.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.453
To unlock this
valley's secrets,

01:59.453 --> 02:02.356
I'm meeting up with one of
South America's finest chefs

02:02.356 --> 02:04.625
on the side of a
mountain obviously.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.259
Virgilio.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.361
VIRGILIO: Hey how you doing?

02:07.361 --> 02:09.363
GORDON: Finally.
VIRGILIO: How are you.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.399
GORDON: Michelin starred
Virgilio Martinez is
famous for his modern

02:12.399 --> 02:15.135
twist on traditional
high‐altitude cuisine.

02:15.602 --> 02:19.239
He's cooking up a storm
in the food world and is
basically a younger,

02:19.239 --> 02:23.577
better looking Peruvian
version of me. Damn him.

02:24.945 --> 02:25.979
Good to see you man.

02:25.979 --> 02:26.980
VIRGILIO: Good to see you.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.048
GORDON: I'm so
happy to be here.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.616
VIRGILIO: Yeah?
GORDON: Seriously.

02:29.616 --> 02:32.853
I am here to learn,
discover, where do we start
and where are we gonna go?

02:32.853 --> 02:36.256
VIRGILIO: We're
gonna start up there.

02:36.623 --> 02:37.991
GORDON: Stop it.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.161
VIRGILIO: Over there
we get the best view
of the Sacred Valley.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.729
GORDON: Right.
VIRGILIO: Yeah.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.799
I mean you wanna feel
this extreme altitude,

02:45.799 --> 02:48.168
it's totally another world.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.470
GORDON: Wow I'm out
of breath already.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.173
VIRGILIO: Let's go. Vamos.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.176
GORDON: Of course, the best
view of the Sacred Valley

02:56.176 --> 03:00.147
would have to be a 1300 foot
climb up a sheer rock face.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.851
For a challenge like
this, you need balance,

03:04.851 --> 03:08.155
courage and above all
comprehensive insurance.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.999
6 foot 2, 210 pound chefs

03:19.299 --> 03:23.670
should not be scaling
400 meter cliffs.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.140
I mean normally
chefs bond over dinner,

03:27.140 --> 03:30.143
I can't believe we're bonding
on a cliff edge on a mountain.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.291
GORDON: Breath is very short.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.894
We're now close to
10,000 feet above sea level.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.864
Here there's 30%
less oxygen in the air.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.400
Virgilio, how come
you're not out of breath?

03:53.400 --> 03:56.403
You're running up here like
a guinea pig chasing dinner.

03:57.037 --> 04:00.741
Experts recommend taking
six days to acclimatize
to the altitude,

04:00.741 --> 04:03.310
I've had almost six minutes.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.779
Man.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.682
There's a loose
rock here by the way.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.319
(bleep) (bleep) (bleep).

04:17.090 --> 04:19.526
Are you trying to kill me?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.863
My trousers have turned brown.

04:32.973 --> 04:38.378
(bleep) (bleep).

04:44.251 --> 04:48.188
I get the view.
The view is incredible.

04:48.488 --> 04:49.790
Amazing.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.791
VIRGILIO: Yes?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.259
GORDON: I'm out of
breath but I get it.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.866
GORDON: Shall we eat?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.704
GORDON: Oh Lord.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.278
GORDON: No.
VIRGILIO: No.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.980
GORDON: No. Never.
So it's like a jerky?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.282
VIRGILIO: Beef jerky yeah.

05:15.282 --> 05:16.583
It's like a beef
jerky of course.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.618
Yeah. We dry this for 34 hours.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.453
GORDON: Wow that's delicious.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.623
Does the altitude make a
massive difference on taste?

05:23.623 --> 05:25.158
VIRGILIO: Taste is deep.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.560
GORDON: Right.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.729
VIRGILIO: Intense,
concentrate, the conditions
are very extreme,

05:29.729 --> 05:32.766
so these ingredients has to
be protected by themselves,

05:32.766 --> 05:35.202
so they are then full
of proteins and they are

05:35.202 --> 05:38.238
concentrated by
flavor and taste.

05:39.005 --> 05:43.944
One of the main things
is that food is
protected by altitudes.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.378
GORDON: It's pure I suppose.

05:45.378 --> 05:46.513
VIRGILIO: It's very pure.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.615
We don't have to say
we have organic things,

05:48.615 --> 05:50.851
I mean that word
doesn't have a meaning here.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.519
GORDON: Really good.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.288
I mean it puts jerky on a
completely different level.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.457
VIRGILIO: So now you have time
to study the Sacred Valley.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.525
GORDON: Right.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.398
GORDON: Yeah.
Cook together.

06:05.398 --> 06:06.933
VIRGILIO: Yeah?
Cook together.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.401
GORDON: A cook off at
the end of the week.

06:08.401 --> 06:09.669
VIRGILIO: Yeah.
End of the week.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.338
GORDON: I'm
gonna kick your ass.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.614
GORDON: That was quite
the climb and we've now

06:20.614 --> 06:23.316
established two things,
Peruvians look better than

06:23.316 --> 06:25.986
Brits in plastic
climbing helmets.

06:31.157 --> 06:34.794
And I've just got five days
to uncover the secrets of
the Sacred Valley,

06:35.161 --> 06:39.099
to devise a feast that
shows that handsome devil
Virgilio who's boss.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.136
So lungs screaming I'm
heading 5000 feet further up

06:43.136 --> 06:46.640
for a lesson in the ancient
art of Andean cooking.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.042
Wow, come on.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.112
Look at this.
Oh my Lord.

06:55.348 --> 06:59.219
This is incredible.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.025
Now this is to start, one
of the highest parts of the

07:05.025 --> 07:07.827
Sacred Valley and I'm here
to meet some farmers that are

07:07.827 --> 07:11.331
still farming from this
land but using techniques

07:11.331 --> 07:13.900
dating back to the Incas.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.508
Because my Spanish is as
good as my rock climbing,

07:21.508 --> 07:24.544
the family I'm meeting has
asked a friend to translate.

07:24.811 --> 07:25.845
Celine.

07:25.845 --> 07:26.980
CELINE: Hi.
GORDON: How are you darling?

07:26.980 --> 07:28.248
CELINE: I'm good
how you doing?

07:28.248 --> 07:29.749
GORDON: Yeah good to see you.
Oh my Lord. Come on seriously.

07:29.749 --> 07:30.784
CELINE: I know, I know.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.851
GORDON: Amazing.
Are the family here?

07:31.851 --> 07:34.321
CELINE: Yeah they're here.
Mario, Maxima!

07:36.456 --> 07:37.824
GORDON: Buenas Tardes.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.127
GORDON: Mario, nice
to see you. Please.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.763
ELANCHIO: Elanchio.
GORDON: Elanchio.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.968
GORDON: And this is Marina.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.937
Oh hello. This is?

07:50.937 --> 07:53.173
Sebastian and this is.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.774
Hello.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.743
Congratulations, having the
most gorgeous back garden

07:56.743 --> 07:58.878
anywhere in the world.

08:01.247 --> 08:04.718
Sebastian. Ah.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.886
The family has
invited me to dinner,

08:06.886 --> 08:09.289
a classic Andean dish made
from local ingredients

08:09.289 --> 08:12.192
and it looks like I'm
playing sous chef.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.131
GORDON: De chuno
okay, great, thank you.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.434
Lawa de Chuno is a soup with
an amazing special recipe.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.270
So these are,
they're dried potatoes.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.272
GORDON: Right.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.807
It's amazing how
hard they are.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.376
They're solid,
they're like pebbles.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.145
(speaking Spanish).

08:32.145 --> 08:33.346
GORDON: So clean it.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.814
CELINE: Now we're
gonna make chuno flour.

08:34.814 --> 08:37.884
GORDON: Oh sorry Sebastian,
I don't know why I keep on

08:37.884 --> 08:39.252
getting you like that.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.521
This is the largest
pestle and mortar I've
seen in my entire life,

08:41.521 --> 08:43.289
so literally...

08:46.993 --> 08:49.162
CELINE: You gotta do
it stronger and faster.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.296
GORDON: (bleep).

08:50.296 --> 08:52.232
How do you stop the
potatoes from falling out?

08:52.232 --> 08:53.967
Sorry.

08:55.535 --> 09:00.573
This reminds me of a Fred
Flintstone outside kitchen.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.210
Wow.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.113
How come nobody else is
out of breath? (bleep).

09:09.716 --> 09:13.453
GORDON: My back (bleep)
that's hard, really.

09:19.993 --> 09:24.397
GORDON: The next ingredient
in our soup is a herb that
thrives at 14000 feet.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.568
With this recipe I
can definitely cancel
my gym membership.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.003
So he does this every day?

09:30.003 --> 09:31.371
CELINE: Uh yeah.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.006
GORDON: He's as fit
as a butcher's dog.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.008
Wait Mario two secs.

09:35.008 --> 09:39.112
Yeah, it's amazing how easy
it is to get out of breath.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.485
CELINE: Let's go.
GORDON: Let's go.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.532
GORDON: Wow.
CELINE: Thank you.

10:03.703 --> 10:04.904
CELINE: That's the kunuka.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.840
GORDON: It's down there.
That's the kunuka.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.408
Oh man.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.143
CELINE: Mario wants
you to go get it.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.244
GORDON: Go get it?
CELINE: Yeah.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.882
GORDON: (bleep).

10:17.117 --> 10:19.552
GORDON: (bleep).
These rocks are slippy.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.022
(bleep).

10:32.065 --> 10:34.367
GORDON: It is
literally breathtaking.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.102
Slippy.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.041
GORDON: There's
nothing to grab onto.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.177
Newsflash.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.647
In the Andes, high altitude
herb gardens are a little
different to those back home.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.585
At least I've
still got my dignity.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.822
(bleep) Mario honestly.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.961
I'm glad you're having
a fun time up there.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.631
Kunuka yes.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.834
GORDON: Boom, look at this.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.537
So it looks a
little bit like thyme.

11:14.674 --> 11:20.446
Very floral. Very
fragrant. It's lovely.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.316
How much do we need?

11:23.316 --> 11:25.251
CELINE: Yeah,
that's good he says.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.619
GORDON: That's it. Wow.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.923
That smells
amazing and it's free.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.028
With a fistful of herbs
and a leg full of bruises,

11:35.028 --> 11:37.463
it's off to the family
kitchen to get cooking.

11:37.463 --> 11:40.900
Beautiful.
Boy oh boy.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.303
That's extraordinary.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.239
Look at this
place and that there,

11:46.239 --> 11:50.443
that's obviously the
stove, oh what's that.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.447
Guinea pigs.

11:54.447 --> 11:58.017
Hey. Look at them.

11:58.785 --> 12:02.188
In the Andes, guinea pigs
are known by a different name.

12:02.188 --> 12:04.123
Dinner.

12:04.123 --> 12:07.560
Wow. Look at that.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.999
It actually looks
delicious, I mean seriously.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.501
The fact is the live ones
are running down there,

12:15.501 --> 12:19.105
the bald ones are hanging
off the wall and guess
who's next in line.

12:19.105 --> 12:22.375
That furry (bleep)
over there at 9:00.

12:29.849 --> 12:33.186
While the guinea pig
roasts, a sentence I
thought I'd never say,

12:33.186 --> 12:35.655
prep continues for the
ancient Andean soup.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.257
Lawa de Chuno.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.692
We have the herb,
this smells amazing.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.429
GORDON: So it's a
leg of lamb right?
WOMAN: Yep.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.164
GORDON: And is this your lamb.
WOMAN: Si.

12:45.164 --> 12:48.668
GORDON: So in many ways,
the whole family is
self‐sufficient from the land.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.039
GORDON: That is incredible.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.407
I love snooping
round kitchens,

12:54.407 --> 12:57.110
what's all that up there, the
top of the the big white stuff.

13:02.548 --> 13:03.950
CELINE: Cow manure.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.985
GORDON: Cow manure.
For the stove.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.353
CELINE: For the stove.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.255
GORDON: And that
'cause it burns good fuel.

13:09.255 --> 13:10.623
WOMAN: Yeah.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.859
GORDON: I just love
the fact that none of
you waste anything.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.297
GORDON: Potatoes in.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.133
CELINE: All of it yeah.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.106
GORDON: What is that?

13:27.106 --> 13:30.910
Oh you're turning the gas up.
Gotcha my love. Ready.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.915
(bleep).

13:38.384 --> 13:39.585
Cheese.

13:39.585 --> 13:42.255
I'd never have thought about
finishing a lamb and potato soup

13:42.255 --> 13:43.589
with cheese.

13:43.589 --> 13:48.995
Amazing and look at
that baby, beautiful.

13:49.529 --> 13:52.832
We should open a
restaurant together.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.502
Mama, this deserves champagne.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.105
Napkins. Let's go babies.

14:06.412 --> 14:10.416
CELINE: Before we eat, Mario's
going to make an offering to
the mountain gods.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.761
(speaking gibberish).

14:21.761 --> 14:24.764
GORDON: My apologies.
My apologies.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.132
I'm dying to taste this.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.834
CELINE: Okay,
(speaking Spanish).

14:27.834 --> 14:29.369
GORDON: Okay. Guinea pig.

14:29.369 --> 14:33.272
It's just hard eating
this now when we've just
been sat there with them.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.375
I don't know about the head.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.811
I'll go for the loin.
The loin, the loin, the loin.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.685
Pretty good.
It's like a suckling pig.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.954
WOMAN: Si.
GORDON: Excellent.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.757
The soup.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.562
Ooh it's good.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.499
It's like a traditional
British old fashioned stew

14:59.499 --> 15:01.934
but this things got more depth.

15:01.934 --> 15:07.140
Because it's a high altitude
sort of cooking every ounce of

15:07.140 --> 15:09.575
flavor you taste individually.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.211
Really delicious.
Mucho gracias.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.647
MARIO: Mucho gracias.
GORDON: Thank you. Gracias.

15:15.214 --> 15:19.385
That was extraordinary because
that is a proper insight,

15:19.385 --> 15:23.456
something as basic as
the huts could produce
a dish like that.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.726
That's highlighting high
altitude cooking at its best.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.061
Ow.

15:29.061 --> 15:31.697
Already I'm starting
to think, you know,
how I would use that.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.566
You, little...

15:33.566 --> 15:35.835
What an amazing family
and what an amazing dish.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.537
No don't pull
hair, don't pull hair.

15:37.537 --> 15:41.541
I need that. Ah!
Oh no, come on.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.616
Maybe it's the incredible
hospitality shown by my new

15:50.616 --> 15:54.687
Andean family or the
fresh guinea pig coursing
through my veins,

15:54.687 --> 15:58.691
but I'm even more determined
to win the battle with Virgilio.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.602
Man, are you out of breath?

16:09.602 --> 16:12.305
HARESH: No.
GORDON: I am.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.974
So I've enlisted
the help of Haresh.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.177
A restaurant supplier
with culinary contacts
all over the valley.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.947
He's told me about a local
delicacy that tastes like

16:20.947 --> 16:24.083
shrimp crossed with calamari.

16:25.117 --> 16:28.221
You're telling me that this
delicacy is sought after and

16:28.221 --> 16:30.590
is only found at this height.

16:30.590 --> 16:34.260
HARESH: Yeah and there's the
man that knows how to find them.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.495
Mamerdo.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.132
GORDON: Hola.
Good to see you.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.134
I am keen to see
this delicacy.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.905
HARESH: We've gotta
go this way he says.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.740
GORDON: Let's go.
MAMERDO: Vamos.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.748
GORDON: The cactus?
MAMERDO: Si.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.416
GORDON: That's
the delicacy there?
MAMERDO: Si.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.018
GORDON: On the
edge of the cliff.

17:09.929 --> 17:12.498
GORDON: Captain let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.168
GORDON: Oh man.
HARESH: Good luck.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.440
GORDON: Yes.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.812
GORDON: Is that a rock there?

17:29.115 --> 17:31.117
GORDON: All this
for a (bleep) worm?

17:31.117 --> 17:34.353
Seriously? Oh man.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.197
GORDON: Mamerdo,
you are crazy.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.300
Okay lasso..

17:47.300 --> 17:51.037
Over 30 years of working
as a chef has all been
leading to this moment,

17:51.037 --> 17:54.507
catching a Peruvian
cactus worm with a lasso.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.444
MAMERDO: Una, dos, tres.

17:59.011 --> 18:02.448
Oh.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.452
GORDON: Haresh,
I'm gonna kill you.

18:06.452 --> 18:08.054
HARESH: You gotta
get up here first.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.356
GORDON: Oh man.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.962
'Scuse. That is not funny.

18:17.396 --> 18:19.098
HARESH: Be careful.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.600
GORDON: This is
super dangerous.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.786
GORDON: Si, si, si, si.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.954
Wahay.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.889
(speaking Spanish).

18:44.190 --> 18:47.293
GORDON: Good job.
High five. Look at that.

18:51.030 --> 18:54.033
GORDON: Seriously? (bleep).

18:59.138 --> 19:00.539
HARESH: It's
gonna be delicious.

19:00.539 --> 19:01.807
I'm proud of you.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.682
GORDON: Ay‐ay‐ay

19:13.052 --> 19:14.553
GORDON: They're like
giant caterpillars.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.856
How did he first
learn about these?

19:30.336 --> 19:31.604
GORDON: Excellent.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.305
And how old were you when you
first started dangling off the

19:33.305 --> 19:35.241
side of a cliff with
your dad looking for worms?

19:38.044 --> 19:39.378
GORDON: Six or seven. Amazing.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.486
I'm just gonna get
them a little bit dry.

19:47.486 --> 19:50.156
Just so it doesn't crackle.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.325
Okay go.

19:53.325 --> 19:55.361
(bleep).

19:55.695 --> 19:57.563
HARESH: Are you okay there?

20:02.768 --> 20:04.437
MAMERDO: Oh bravo.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.873
GORDON: Thank you.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.044
GORDON: Stop it.

20:34.333 --> 20:39.305
GORDON: It's like a crispy...
uhhh...like a crispy...

20:39.305 --> 20:42.208
cockroach.

20:48.848 --> 20:52.318
The taste was crispy to begin
with, fine, however the inside.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.520
No. No bueno.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.056
But this is how they
survived so remotely.

20:57.056 --> 21:00.259
Protein growing
literally in a cactus.

21:00.259 --> 21:04.063
So an amazing secret
and a big eye opener.

21:08.167 --> 21:12.071
I'm blown away by the
ingenious ways Andean people
get their ingredients,

21:12.071 --> 21:15.674
it's the first time
I've ever taken a lasso
to go food shopping.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.247
But with just three days
left, one thing is certain,

21:21.247 --> 21:24.650
I won't beat Chef Virgilio
serving a plate of worms.

21:24.650 --> 21:28.220
So, it's time to ditch
the motorbike and get
my head in the clouds.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.716
Are absolutely
(bleep) gigantic.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.290
Coming in to land.
You beauty.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.967
This is the Cajabamba jungle.

22:16.802 --> 22:20.539
Said to be home to the
best fruit in the world.

22:22.107 --> 22:25.511
Look at these trees. Amazing.

22:28.314 --> 22:33.252
And I'm heading to a family
farm packed with the biggest
mango trees I've ever seen.

22:35.221 --> 22:36.689
Finally.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.725
GORDON: How are you?
WOMAN: I'm okay thank you.

22:39.725 --> 22:41.160
GORDON: Good to see you.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.697
GORDON: Oh my Lord,
um, so happy to be here.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.933
Virgilio said that you
had the best exotic fruit.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.635
WOMAN: Yes we do indeed.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.170
GORDON: What's so
special about the fruit here?

23:01.914 --> 23:03.782
GORDON: A lot more sugary.
WOMAN: Yes indeed.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.050
GORDON: So more
in depth flavor.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.152
WOMAN: More flavor.
Yes because of the altitude.

23:07.152 --> 23:09.722
GORDON: Amazing. Amazing.
Okay. How do we get them?

23:09.722 --> 23:10.923
MAN: Okay.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.258
GORDON: You can go
on my shoulders.

23:12.258 --> 23:14.727
(speaking Spanish).

23:15.527 --> 23:18.797
GORDON: The
mangoes are 100 feet up.

23:18.797 --> 23:22.001
Only the youngest,
fittest, locals pick them.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.606
GORDON: Until now.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.308
Wow. Am I getting a harness?

23:29.308 --> 23:30.376
WOMAN: Yes you are.

23:30.376 --> 23:33.245
GORDON: Okay good. Good.
Thank God for that.

23:33.545 --> 23:36.415
Don't let me drop. Okay.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.516
DAVID: Promise.

23:37.516 --> 23:41.053
GORDON: If I drop, the
food world is (bleep).

23:43.555 --> 23:45.524
You ready?
David you good?

23:45.524 --> 23:47.893
Let's go.

23:49.228 --> 23:52.598
Okay, oh my Lord.

23:53.465 --> 23:54.967
WOMAN: Go to your left.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.702
GORDON: We're going to
the rope now or not?

24:04.543 --> 24:06.211
GORDON: Gotcha. So he's
going round the outside.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.580
WOMAN: Yes and you
need to follow him.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.282
GORDON: Let's go daddy.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.552
GORDON: Okay
David here I come.

24:13.552 --> 24:15.788
(bleep).

24:15.788 --> 24:17.890
I've never made love to a tree.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.628
WOMAN: You can do it.

24:32.071 --> 24:35.274
WOMAN: Try to push yourself
up with your left elbow.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.114
GORDON: I'm stuck.
Fricking hell.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.488
I need you to get the mangoes
from here because there's

24:49.488 --> 24:52.758
no way those branches are
gonna take my weight, please?

24:52.758 --> 24:55.461
Let's go Tarzan.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.199
I haven't climbed a
tree for decades and um,

25:00.199 --> 25:04.737
I mean decades you know I
was worried I'd snap those

25:04.737 --> 25:07.373
branches then we'd all come
down so the last thing I wanna

25:07.373 --> 25:10.709
do is go into this incredible
jungle and damage an amazing

25:10.709 --> 25:13.846
tree that's been
there for centuries.

25:14.913 --> 25:18.250
Oh boy. Look at that.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.824
Wow. That is delicious.

25:25.824 --> 25:28.093
It's so juicy.

25:29.261 --> 25:32.031
The difference in the flavor
is extraordinary because it's

25:32.031 --> 25:35.667
highly concentrated so it
just bursts with flavor.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.737
An amazing discovery.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.673
It's been a real eye‐opener
to see how much the strong sun

25:41.673 --> 25:44.676
and low humidity enhance
the fruit's sweetness.

25:45.744 --> 25:48.614
That amazing mango
will definitely be on
my cook off feast menu

25:48.614 --> 25:53.485
and if Virgilio asks, trust me
I've picked it myself okay?

26:05.731 --> 26:08.133
Now this country's famous
for its incredible fish

26:08.133 --> 26:10.536
and this lake produces them.

26:11.036 --> 26:12.971
Come on look at this place,
honestly if you thought

26:12.971 --> 26:15.307
Scotland was beautiful,
this beats it hands down.

26:15.841 --> 26:19.845
At 11,000 feet Lake Huaypo is
one of the highest in the world

26:19.845 --> 26:24.116
and it's the breeding ground
for Peruvian silverside,

26:24.116 --> 26:26.685
a sacred valley staple.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.457
I'm down to meet an
amazing fisherman, Domingo,

26:31.457 --> 26:35.127
who is a dab hand at fishing
and like all good Scotsman,

26:35.127 --> 26:36.829
trust me, I grew up
with a rod and reel

26:36.829 --> 26:38.997
so hey capitan how are you?

26:39.965 --> 26:41.567
GORDON: Good to see you.
We good?

26:42.201 --> 26:43.669
GORDON: I'm so
happy to be here.

26:43.669 --> 26:47.372
Now the fish locally
are small, big.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.442
GORDON: Big fish.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.078
Excellent and
we're gonna use a fly.

26:54.646 --> 26:55.981
GORDON: What is that?

26:57.316 --> 26:59.017
GORDON: That's it?

26:59.318 --> 27:01.987
GORDON: No.
Oh my Lord.

27:01.987 --> 27:03.489
And where have you
parked the boat?

27:05.090 --> 27:06.658
GORDON: This is the boat?

27:06.658 --> 27:08.260
DOMINGO: Si, botes.

27:08.260 --> 27:12.598
GORDON: Really?
What the (bleep).

27:23.609 --> 27:25.043
GORDON: What's
the boat made of?

27:25.043 --> 27:26.678
What? Inner tubes.

27:26.678 --> 27:29.114
DOMINGO: Si.
GORDON: And bottles
and bits of float.

27:29.948 --> 27:33.085
Incredibly Andean fishing
boats are often made of trash.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.722
Okay. Oh my Lordie.

27:36.722 --> 27:39.725
For the locals these ingenious
low cost crafts are

27:39.725 --> 27:42.094
light weight and maneuverable.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.197
But for me not so much.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.532
(bleep).

27:46.532 --> 27:47.900
Holy mackerel.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.435
Domingo, I think this thing's
gonna (bleep) burst any minute.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.773
GORDON: Oh my Lord. Gracias.

27:55.407 --> 27:58.443
If we sink, how
deep is it in there?

28:00.179 --> 28:02.881
GORDON: (bleep).

28:10.556 --> 28:14.359
Domingo. Fish. Jump.

28:20.265 --> 28:23.669
Domingo's teaching me
his highly technical
style of line fishing.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.805
So let's take some bait.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.907
Be good.
Show me.

28:34.012 --> 28:36.215
GORDON: What the (bleep).

28:36.882 --> 28:39.184
(speaking Spanish).

28:40.252 --> 28:41.920
GORDON: Bollocks.

28:50.529 --> 28:54.266
GORDON: Oh (bleep).

28:55.667 --> 28:59.171
Trust me.
You think this looks easy.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.607
It's way harder than it
looks I'm telling you.

29:01.607 --> 29:03.609
Well, I've been fishing
for a thousand hours.

29:03.609 --> 29:06.745
We never give up.
Come on fishes.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.752
Okay. Got the fish.

29:18.156 --> 29:23.061
So hey, trust me,

29:23.528 --> 29:26.965
I'll take it after all that
(bleep) hard work, honestly.

29:29.968 --> 29:32.838
Okay I'll take the scales off.

29:33.739 --> 29:37.542
To prepare our pint sized
Peruvian silverside
Domingo has a paste.

29:38.910 --> 29:41.046
What's in here?
What is that? Chili?

29:44.716 --> 29:46.885
GORDON: Delicious.
Smells good.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.189
GORDON: Thank you.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.793
(speaking Spanish).

29:54.793 --> 29:57.362
GORDON: Beautiful.
Look at that.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.698
Tiny fish for two grown men.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.800
So we're gonna
eat this slowly.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.337
On this lunch, the good news
is we're not gonna get fat.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.275
Delicious.

30:11.543 --> 30:14.846
GORDON: And your boating
technique is incredible.

30:16.415 --> 30:17.416
Excellent.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.521
That was amazing.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.790
The fish was almost
like a cross between
a catfish and a trout,

30:24.790 --> 30:28.093
very sweet, very flaky, and
it was really, really good.

30:28.093 --> 30:30.896
He had the chili paste
marinating the fish in,

30:30.896 --> 30:33.432
that paste with that
chili and those herbs,

30:33.432 --> 30:36.134
you know, it's got
me thinking big time.

30:38.904 --> 30:40.939
Peru is famous for its pastes.

30:40.939 --> 30:43.809
But I have an idea for a high
altitude twist that might just

30:43.809 --> 30:46.712
help me kick Virgilio's arse.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.649
And with 24 hours
till the cook off,

30:50.649 --> 30:53.385
I wanna get my hands on a food
Andeans were the first people

30:53.385 --> 30:56.421
on earth to cultivate.

31:00.926 --> 31:04.629
Now this farmer produces
the most amazing potatoes,

31:04.629 --> 31:08.567
in fact, he's actually known
as the mad potato scientist.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.938
Also, he's known for producing
the most amazing beer,

31:12.938 --> 31:16.041
so I can't wait to meet
this guy and Haresh is
gonna introduce me to him.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.777
HARESH: Absolutely and
there he actually is.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.679
Manuel. Manuel.

31:24.082 --> 31:25.384
GORDON: Good to
see you Manuel.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.352
The mad potato scientist.

31:27.352 --> 31:29.321
(speaking Spanish).

31:29.654 --> 31:32.157
GORDON: Everybody's going on
about these amazing potatoes,

31:32.157 --> 31:33.825
what's so special about them?

31:37.362 --> 31:39.131
GORDON: Wow.

31:42.300 --> 31:45.003
GORDON: Stop it. Blue?
Have you been drinking?

31:46.438 --> 31:48.473
MANUEL: No.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.242
GORDON: Let's cook it
and see if it's blue.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.644
(speaking Spanish).

31:54.045 --> 31:55.680
GORDON: With his
mad science skills,

31:55.680 --> 31:57.983
Manuel cross pollinates
high altitude potato strains

31:57.983 --> 32:00.652
once used by the Incas,

32:01.420 --> 32:04.689
and for lunch his proud
parents have prepared
some of the results.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.395
HARESH: I wanna show you
what our potatoes look like.

32:10.395 --> 32:13.865
GORDON: Oh boy. Man.
That is amazing.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.669
HARESH: Look at that.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.271
GORDON: Oh my God,
it's like a beetroot.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.640
It does not look
like a potato.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.009
You are a crazy scientist.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.944
Oh boy.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.346
You can just see that
starch coming out there.

32:28.346 --> 32:29.915
So how do you cook them?

32:29.915 --> 32:31.349
(speaking Spanish).

32:31.349 --> 32:32.984
HARESH: They're baked
in an oven. Roasted.

32:32.984 --> 32:35.487
GORDON: Baked in the oven.
I'm dying to taste these.

32:37.722 --> 32:40.192
Wow. Even the skin's delicious.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.661
HARESH: Yeah, the whole
thing it's almost meaty.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.296
GORDON: Man.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.368
GORDON: Wow.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.842
GORDON: Apparently
these stunning pigments
protect the potatoes

32:56.842 --> 33:00.545
from the intense ultraviolet
light here at altitude,

33:00.545 --> 33:02.747
what a gift for
the mountain gods.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.184
HARESH: This one's gonna
surprise you even more.

33:06.184 --> 33:07.686
GORDON: That's incredible.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.154
How the hell d'you
peel something like that,

33:09.154 --> 33:10.689
I mean literally.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.079
GORDON: And no wonder he's
still single at the age of 30

33:34.079 --> 33:35.714
he's got no fricking chance.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.983
Who's gonna peel that.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.754
Business complete it's
time for some booze.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.389
HARESH: Beer made out of corn.

33:46.324 --> 33:47.726
GORDON: Gracias.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.961
HARESH: This is unique
to the Andean highlands.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.334
GORDON: Tastes like a
strawberry champagne.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.404
GORDON: You could give the
French a kick up the arse.

33:59.404 --> 34:01.706
And the sweetness from
those wild strawberries
is delicious.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.008
MANUEL: Si.

34:03.008 --> 34:05.443
GORDON: Mucho gracias.
Mama papa gracias.

34:05.443 --> 34:06.811
HARESH: Thank you bravo.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.580
GORDON: This is
very dangerous for me.

34:08.580 --> 34:12.584
High altitudes, alcohol
and something that's
incredibly moreish.

34:13.451 --> 34:16.621
This is the kind of discovery
that sends me straight back to

34:16.621 --> 34:20.292
my kitchen because
I've just tasted the
most amazing potatoes.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.294
I mean extraordinary.

34:22.294 --> 34:24.763
The different colors,
the different flavor,

34:24.763 --> 34:27.732
the diversity's mind blowing.

34:28.533 --> 34:32.070
And then the Chicha, I mean
that will wipe the smile off

34:32.070 --> 34:34.906
any Frenchman's, uh, vineyard.

34:34.906 --> 34:38.009
Let me tell you, sod
their (bleep) pink
champagne from now on in.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.210
Toast.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.445
HARESH: Thank you.

34:40.445 --> 34:41.880
(speaking Spanish).

34:41.880 --> 34:43.648
GORDON: Salud.
Excellent. Thank you.

34:49.054 --> 34:51.823
It's the day of the cook off,
so me and my hangover are

34:51.823 --> 34:53.792
hitting Urubamba.

34:53.792 --> 34:57.062
The Sacred Valley's largest
town on a last minute mission

34:57.062 --> 35:00.599
to find culinary inspiration
and maybe some aspirin.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.401
Wow. Oh my Lord.

35:03.401 --> 35:06.638
Now that is what
I call a market.

35:07.138 --> 35:10.275
Look at the colors and
you know damn well that

35:10.275 --> 35:14.346
everything's been hand grown,
hand‐picked and literally

35:14.346 --> 35:17.549
hours ago plucked straight
from the Sacred Valley.

35:17.549 --> 35:20.552
Right time to dive in.

35:22.587 --> 35:25.256
(speaking Spanish).

35:28.126 --> 35:31.463
GORDON: Seis, por favor.
Six. Seis. Gracias.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.531
Uh this one.
What is this?

35:36.401 --> 35:38.269
GORDON: To eat no?

35:41.106 --> 35:43.541
GORDON: Good luck.
I won't be needing that.

35:43.541 --> 35:45.176
But just in case.

35:46.511 --> 35:49.180
Yes. Gracias.

35:50.181 --> 35:54.252
GORDON: Potatoes.
Extraordinary. Salt.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.889
GORDON: Si. From the
local salt mines.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.357
Look at the way that glistens.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.259
It's almost like little
rough cut diamonds.

36:01.259 --> 36:02.861
Beautiful.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.797
I'm hoping these diamonds
are a chef's best friend.

36:10.669 --> 36:14.072
Oh my Lord. Amazing.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.980
Six avocado please.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.716
Couple of bulbs of garlic.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.952
And I've just spotted a big fan
of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

36:30.755 --> 36:31.756
GORDON: Wow.

36:31.756 --> 36:33.191
(speaking Spanish).

36:33.191 --> 36:34.392
GORDON: You want
me to bite it?

36:34.392 --> 36:36.361
WOMAN: Si.
GORDON: At 7:00
in the morning?

36:40.598 --> 36:42.534
GORDON: Si.
That's hot.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.402
You eat this for breakfast?

36:44.803 --> 36:49.174
Man. Ay, ay, ay.
My mouth is on fire.

36:49.174 --> 36:50.475
Madam, madam.

36:50.475 --> 36:53.011
WOMAN: Thank you, thank you.
GORDON: Thank you, thank you.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.313
Oh my Lord.

36:56.114 --> 36:58.917
Armed with a chili from
my Peruvian Spice Girl,

36:58.917 --> 37:01.352
I'm ready to face
my culinary foe.

37:01.352 --> 37:04.422
So I'm heading to Mil, a
Sacred Valley restaurant

37:04.422 --> 37:07.325
11 and a half thousand feet up
for my cook off with the

37:07.325 --> 37:11.262
Prince of Peruvian
cuisine Virgilio Martinez.

37:11.262 --> 37:14.232
Virgilio. Man look
at this place.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.533
VIRGILIO: Hey, how are you?

37:15.533 --> 37:16.668
GORDON: You good,
good to see you.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.103
VIRGILIO: How's it going?

37:18.103 --> 37:21.539
GORDON: Uh, first of all,
that is a spot for a
restaurant honestly.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.074
You're a lucky boy.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.644
So, uh, what a week.
I have been everywhere.

37:27.212 --> 37:30.181
I understand the Sacred Valley
like it's the back of my hand.

37:30.181 --> 37:31.516
You crazy man.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.451
VIRGILIO: Are you sure. Really?
GORDON: I'm hoping so.

37:33.451 --> 37:34.786
VIRGILIO: You
did your homework.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.988
GORDON: I did do my
homework so I'm dying
to get into the kitchen

37:36.988 --> 37:39.591
because I wanna show you
what I've understood and
got up to speed with.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.026
VIRGILIO: Oy, no kitchen,
we're gonna cook outdoors.

37:42.961 --> 37:48.166
You see the fire, and
this is your stove,

37:48.633 --> 37:50.468
you know, this is
our technology.

37:50.468 --> 37:52.403
GORDON: Seriously?
VIRGILIO: Yeah.

37:52.403 --> 37:53.805
GORDON: Oh stop it.
VIRGILIO: Yeah.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.440
GORDON: Bloody hell.

38:03.381 --> 38:05.717
VIRGILIO: I'm gonna
show you your kitchen.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.051
GORDON: Fricking hell.

38:07.051 --> 38:08.620
I've never cooked on
a stove like that.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.388
VIRGILIO: Yeah, you
know, we call it huatia,

38:10.388 --> 38:11.990
uh, yeah okay.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.992
GORDON: Huatia, this technique
how far does this go back?

38:13.992 --> 38:16.027
VIRGILIO: This is very
traditional. This is very Inca.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.495
GORDON: And it's
stuck together with mud.

38:17.495 --> 38:19.697
VIRGILIO: Yep.
GORDON: Wow.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.400
Cooking with a mud oven
is not what I had planned.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.904
I'm the outsider so
I've gotta put my game
face on and get dirty.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.173
This is my pestle and mortar.

38:28.173 --> 38:31.276
VIRGILIO: Your station,
your pestle mortar.

38:31.276 --> 38:33.244
This is my, my stove.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.780
GORDON: I've invited
the farmers I met this
week to the feast,

38:35.780 --> 38:38.850
so I need to show them their
lessons haven't gone to waste.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.952
VIRGILIO: That's it man.
Let's make is simple.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.655
GORDON: Now I'm
gonna kick your ass.

38:49.060 --> 38:53.064
I first tasted this meat
five days ago and no,

38:53.064 --> 38:55.800
it's not a giant guinea pig.
Look at this thing.

38:55.800 --> 38:56.801
VIRGILIO: Yeah.

38:56.801 --> 38:58.236
GORDON: The alpaca's
bigger than him.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.208
MAN: Gracias.

39:03.474 --> 39:04.876
GORDON: Right.
VIRGILIO: Choose your cut.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.344
GORDON: I'm gonna
go for the saddle.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.679
VIRGILIO: Oh,
the easy one, huh?

39:07.679 --> 39:10.148
GORDON: No it's not easy, no.
'Cause there's no fat on there.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.950
VIRGILIO: I'll,
I'll pick the neck.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.118
I'm gonna use
some of the tongue.

39:14.118 --> 39:16.054
GORDON: The easy part,
oh, the braised tongue.
There you go.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.956
VIRGILIO: What
about the heart.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.324
GORDON: I love heart.

39:19.324 --> 39:20.658
Which one are
you gonna go for?

39:20.658 --> 39:22.460
VIRGILIO: It's gonna be
difficult you know these guys,

39:22.460 --> 39:24.195
the farmers they...

39:24.195 --> 39:25.530
GORDON: I was cooking
before you were born.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.265
Okay. Yeah.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.100
VIRGILIO: They but these
farmers, they eat,

39:29.100 --> 39:31.035
I mean they are very
used to eating heart.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.503
So it's gonna be tough for you.

39:32.503 --> 39:34.205
GORDON: Okay so
saddle, heart for me.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.140
You're gonna go for
the most delicious part.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.710
VIRGILIO: I'll take
the neck, let's go.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.980
GORDON: I'm excited.
Nervous at the same time.

39:41.980 --> 39:45.750
This cook is serious and I've
gotta draw on everything that

39:45.750 --> 39:49.487
I've learnt all week,
understood, searched for,

39:49.487 --> 39:55.460
dug for, fished for, climbed
for and been out of breath for.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.297
The Sacred Valley,
it's like this oasis,

39:59.297 --> 40:01.532
at high altitude.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.935
Now it's time to
put it on the plate.

40:06.304 --> 40:08.273
So there's no
fat on this loin,

40:08.273 --> 40:11.142
so I just want to make sure
these already have alpaca fat

40:11.142 --> 40:15.980
rendered down almost like
we'd do traditional goose fat.

40:18.082 --> 40:22.186
The alpaca
hearts hit the stove.

40:22.186 --> 40:25.390
But it's me that's
feeling the heat.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.693
What you doing
there with that paste?

40:28.693 --> 40:30.094
VIRGILIO: I'm
doing my marinade.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.362
GORDON: Marinade.

40:31.362 --> 40:34.132
VIRGILIO: Lot of green herbs.
A little bit of huacatay.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.434
The level of
expectations are huge.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.603
GORDON: You may be a
greyhound up the mountainside,

40:38.603 --> 40:41.506
but trust me I do have an
advantage in the kitchen,

40:41.506 --> 40:44.375
which you're gonna taste.

40:45.243 --> 40:48.246
Virgilio might sense victory
with his neck marinade but

40:48.246 --> 40:51.416
I'm about to unleash
my secret weapon.

40:51.816 --> 40:56.587
Right, I'm gonna start my
paste using those amazing
mangoes and some chili.

41:00.858 --> 41:02.160
VIRGILIO: How d'you feel?

41:02.160 --> 41:05.029
GORDON: Yeah. D'you
have any oxygen masks?

41:09.267 --> 41:13.104
From my lungs to the alpaca
hearts to Virgilio's tongue,

41:13.104 --> 41:14.706
it's all happening.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.342
VIRGILIO: Right these
tongues are beautiful.

41:17.342 --> 41:20.078
GORDON: This is like a little
gastric which is done with the

41:20.078 --> 41:25.483
natural sugar and the alpaca's
like a mature sort of almost

41:25.483 --> 41:28.820
like a mature lamb with a
little hint of sweetness,

41:28.820 --> 41:31.889
so I'm gonna glaze
that as they cook.

41:33.858 --> 41:36.494
Virgilio's now cooking
his final alpaca dish.

41:39.163 --> 41:42.800
What's wrong with you?
Here come our farmers.

41:43.568 --> 41:46.037
Ay, ay, ay.
The pressure's on.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.906
Corn. (bleep) (bleep).

41:51.309 --> 41:53.911
Cover that in embers.

41:54.278 --> 41:56.447
My corn on the cob's on fire.

41:56.447 --> 41:58.750
If they survive the stove,
I'll be serving the corn with

41:58.750 --> 42:01.152
Manuel's incredible
multicolored spuds.

42:01.152 --> 42:02.520
VIRGILIO: How is your heart?

42:02.520 --> 42:04.622
GORDON: Pounding right
now, oh those hearts, yeah,

42:04.622 --> 42:07.325
they're a lot more relaxed
than my heart right now.

42:07.558 --> 42:10.561
Okay Virgilio, heart's done.

42:10.561 --> 42:12.797
VIRGILIO: Yeah.

42:12.797 --> 42:13.931
GORDON: They're happy
with the yoke pink right?

42:13.931 --> 42:15.633
VIRGILIO: Yeah. Yeah.

42:18.936 --> 42:20.605
GORDON: Brilliant.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.743
VIRGILIO: Beautiful.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.212
GORDON: And now
it's time to plate up.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.781
VIRGILIO: I mean let me
know when you're ready yeah?

42:29.781 --> 42:30.815
GORDON: I'll be one minute.

42:30.815 --> 42:32.283
VIRGILIO: Come on.

42:35.753 --> 42:38.089
GORDON: I'm hoping next
time he cooks them my way.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.657
He's gonna get married.

42:40.158 --> 42:41.592
VIRGILIO: How are you?

42:41.592 --> 42:44.495
GORDON: Just gimme 30 seconds.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.632
Finally my feast is finished.

42:47.632 --> 42:50.701
I've added my mango paste to
the loins plus Manuel's spuds,

42:50.701 --> 42:53.871
and I'm hoping the heart
are cooked to perfection.

42:53.871 --> 42:56.407
This looks beautiful (bleep).

42:56.407 --> 42:58.476
Really beautiful.

42:58.476 --> 43:01.813
But the competition is fierce.

43:02.713 --> 43:07.518
Quinoa and tongue salad,
alpaca brain omelets
and a neck stew.

43:08.219 --> 43:09.821
Okay, you good.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.222
VIRGILIO: Yeah. Let's go.

43:11.222 --> 43:12.723
GORDON: Hola.
GUESTS: Hola.

43:14.559 --> 43:16.194
GORDON: I'm the pink
man from Great Britain.

43:16.194 --> 43:17.995
Mm smell.

43:17.995 --> 43:20.531
GUESTS: Mm.

43:21.165 --> 43:23.067
GORDON: Beautiful
braised heart. Mm.

43:23.067 --> 43:24.268
GUESTS: Mm.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.170
GORDON: Now, who's
gonna say grace?

43:43.921 --> 43:46.023
GORDON: Bravo.

43:46.724 --> 43:49.460
Tough gig, a stove I've
never cooked on before,

43:49.460 --> 43:52.430
a pile of bricks,
with a furnace inside.

43:52.430 --> 43:55.133
I just wanna pay
respect to what I've learnt,

43:55.133 --> 43:56.868
you know, you've got
the best ingredients,

43:56.868 --> 43:59.670
look from this valley.

43:59.670 --> 44:02.640
So it's sacred for a reason.

44:03.808 --> 44:06.611
These farmers are the
hardest customers of
anyone on the planet.

44:06.611 --> 44:07.812
Why?

44:07.812 --> 44:10.014
Salt of the earth.

44:15.453 --> 44:19.924
There's nothing to do now
except wait for the verdict.

44:21.058 --> 44:23.794
This is not about winning,
it's about pleasing.

44:23.794 --> 44:26.697
And it's also about not
losing face with the locals

44:26.697 --> 44:29.367
in front of one of
Peru's culinary legends.

44:40.044 --> 44:41.445
GORDON: D'you think
they're enjoying it?

44:41.445 --> 44:42.914
VIRGILIO: I've no idea man,
they speak in Quechua.

44:42.914 --> 44:44.015
That was Quechua.

44:44.015 --> 44:46.617
GORDON: Quechua (bleep).
Quechua serious.

44:57.895 --> 45:01.666
GORDON: So here we go.
Fingers crossed.

45:01.666 --> 45:03.134
We're good?
Happy faces?

45:03.134 --> 45:04.302
MAN: Si.
MAN: Si.

45:04.302 --> 45:06.737
GORDON: Si, si. Okay.

45:13.511 --> 45:15.913
GORDON: Ah look see.

45:22.019 --> 45:24.055
HARESH: Okay, so that
one won the popular vote,

45:24.055 --> 45:26.224
the potatoes with
the cheese sauce.

45:26.224 --> 45:28.059
VIRGILIO: Your potatoes.
GORDON: Amazing.

45:28.059 --> 45:30.161
HARESH: But they don't
actually like everything.

45:30.161 --> 45:31.596
That dish she
first pointed to.

45:31.596 --> 45:33.331
GORDON: The heart.

45:33.331 --> 45:35.433
HARESH: The heart she says it's
undercooked that's why they
haven't eaten so much of that.

45:35.433 --> 45:36.901
GORDON: Right.

45:44.375 --> 45:46.510
VIRGILIO: Okay. Good.
Thank you guys.

45:46.510 --> 45:49.313
GORDON: Uh okay. How was
the loin of the alpaca?

45:53.017 --> 45:54.418
HARESH: Si, they loved it.

45:54.418 --> 45:56.087
They said it was
the best dish.

45:56.087 --> 45:59.790
GORDON: Sorry just, just
say that again please?

45:59.790 --> 46:02.627
WOMAN: And the potato.
GORDON: Potatoes and the loin.

46:02.627 --> 46:05.196
(speaking Spanish).

46:08.065 --> 46:10.501
HARESH: And they liked
that, I think that's
the brain dish right?

46:10.501 --> 46:11.802
Okay.

46:11.802 --> 46:14.205
GORDON: It sounds
like it's sort of 50/50.

46:14.205 --> 46:16.440
VIRGILIO: Okay.

46:18.843 --> 46:21.812
GORDON: Mucho gracias
for an amazing week in
the Sacred Valley

46:21.812 --> 46:24.482
and thank you for making
me feel so welcome.

46:24.482 --> 46:25.616
(applause).

46:25.616 --> 46:26.817
Cheers. Cheers.

46:26.817 --> 46:29.053
GUESTS: Bravo, Bravo.
GORDON: Bravo. Salud. Salud.

46:29.053 --> 46:33.457
Capitan. Amazing. Amazing.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.192
VIRGILIO: Have fun, yeah.

46:35.192 --> 46:38.329
GORDON: What an amazing
week and a dream come true.

46:38.329 --> 46:39.497
Why?

46:39.497 --> 46:41.499
Because here in
the Sacred Valley,

46:41.499 --> 46:44.101
I've uncovered a truly mind
blowing culinary culture

46:44.101 --> 46:46.737
using the secrets of the Incas.

46:46.737 --> 46:51.075
Amazing Andean ingenuity
and stunning altitude
enriched ingredients,

46:51.075 --> 46:54.412
the food here kicks the arse
of any fancy restaurant.

46:54.412 --> 46:55.946
Breathtaking.

46:55.946 --> 46:59.350
I don't know all but I've
definitely got a taste and now

46:59.350 --> 47:02.920
more importantly, I'm
on to my next adventure.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.822
Take care. Gracias.
