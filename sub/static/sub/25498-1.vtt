WEBVTT

00:45.440 --> 00:46.390
Why do we collect?

00:46.390 --> 00:49.430
Well, I mean, probably the
main reason is nostalgia.

00:49.430 --> 00:51.150
I mean books could not offer me

00:51.150 --> 00:53.840
what these games could
offer me as a child.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.560
And that's why today these games

00:55.560 --> 00:56.880
mean so much to me now.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.500
The guys who designed these games,

00:58.500 --> 00:59.850
this was their world

00:59.850 --> 01:01.680
and this is their way of sharing

01:01.680 --> 01:04.490
a little piece of their world with us

01:04.490 --> 01:06.030
and that's how the magic started.

01:06.030 --> 01:08.320
Well, to me, I couldn't
imagine my own life,

01:08.320 --> 01:10.690
particularly my formative
years, without them.

01:11.790 --> 01:13.430
The NES, if I was asked, was probably

01:13.430 --> 01:16.980
my favorite toy as a child,
provided it counts as a toy.

01:16.980 --> 01:20.210
You know we're reliving
part of our childhood.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.490
And who wouldn't want to do that?

01:22.490 --> 01:24.690
Children of the past have kind of become

01:24.690 --> 01:26.820
the sufficiently wealthy adults of today.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.370
So they've got the money
to chase after their pasts.

01:30.370 --> 01:31.530
I mean, a lot of it also has to do

01:31.530 --> 01:33.430
with the fact that there
are really great games

01:33.430 --> 01:35.300
that can stand the test of time.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.790
Like if you're really into it,

01:37.790 --> 01:39.390
just do your best not to let it go

01:39.390 --> 01:41.622
'cause when you let it go
that's when you regret it.

02:15.110 --> 02:18.630
102.1 KBIT, the mountain
of pure rock n' roll.

02:18.630 --> 02:21.180
I'm John Bayer, bringing
you into the void.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.431
Let's open those synapses
and let's take a trip

02:23.431 --> 02:26.630
into the past with our next song.

02:26.630 --> 02:27.810
My name is Joe Witter.

02:27.810 --> 02:31.340
I am a 37 year old average collector

02:31.340 --> 02:35.240
from Des Moines, Washington,
just outside of Seattle.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.240
I've been collecting for
about eight years now.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.550
I started when my son was born.

02:40.550 --> 02:43.550
I needed some kind of a hobby
to keep me from going insane

02:43.550 --> 02:45.200
because I was a stay-at-home dad.

02:47.330 --> 02:48.750
Well it's just not gonna be what she wants

02:48.750 --> 02:49.770
to wear when she gets home.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.920
But hey, what are we gonna do?

02:53.650 --> 02:56.210
That wore out quickly when I needed

02:56.210 --> 02:58.340
something else to fill the time,

02:58.340 --> 03:01.440
you know other than
partying, like I used to do.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.944
I'm even more comfortable
with one of these.

03:05.290 --> 03:06.950
My name is Tony Fresolo.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.300
I am 28 years old.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.980
I live in Winter Garden, Florida

03:09.980 --> 03:12.310
and I'm originally from Massachusetts.

03:12.310 --> 03:16.400
I've been collecting now
for a little over six years.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.680
How's the hair look?

03:19.680 --> 03:22.520
I never really had that
many games growing up,

03:22.520 --> 03:27.520
just 'cause my mother was
very sort of anti-video game

03:27.610 --> 03:30.360
for somebody with
attention deficit disorder.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.660
Ah, Atari.

03:31.660 --> 03:32.677
Thank you, bud.

03:32.677 --> 03:35.210
Oh, and what else?

03:35.210 --> 03:38.280
This is where GameCube
sports games come to die.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.510
My name is Ryan Darr.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.130
I'm 25 years old, I'm from
Trumbull, Connecticut.

03:42.130 --> 03:44.620
I've been collecting video
games for about 11 years.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.650
Really it started when my parents

03:46.650 --> 03:50.330
got me a Gameboy with Tetris as a kid.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.910
And I had thought that by stacking

03:52.910 --> 03:54.960
the blocks to the top, you won the game.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.360
So for about a week I
was a Tetris champion

03:58.360 --> 04:00.970
and then my cousin's showed me otherwise.

04:00.970 --> 04:03.360
I'm pretty much obsessed with video games.

04:03.360 --> 04:06.480
For me personally, I
love cleaning a game up,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.290
getting it back to that showroom shine.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.732
Putting it on the shelf,
alphabetizing and all that.

04:11.732 --> 04:15.430
Yeah it all plays a part
in my obsession, anyway.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.660
I didn't start actually
holding on to stuff

04:18.660 --> 04:22.470
until probably high
school because I realized

04:22.470 --> 04:25.340
I wanted to play all the old games again.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.780
Started collecting, went
really hard with it.

04:29.198 --> 04:31.100
I was a console collector early on.

04:31.100 --> 04:35.250
I wanted all the consoles
and that didn't take long

04:36.670 --> 04:39.350
and then I immediately
realized, oh man, these games,

04:39.350 --> 04:41.850
these games are what are hard to find.

04:41.850 --> 04:44.180
So then I started stacking up the games.

04:44.180 --> 04:46.130
Collecting now and playing these games now

04:46.130 --> 04:47.050
is like a new experience.

04:47.050 --> 04:50.590
I never experienced stuff
like Megaman, Metroid,

04:50.590 --> 04:53.950
even the original, like Legend
of Zelda or all that stuff.

04:53.950 --> 04:56.600
I never got to experience
it fully when I was a kid.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.340
So when I started
collecting, it became more

05:00.340 --> 05:04.350
of a fun experience for
me to play these games.

05:04.350 --> 05:06.890
A lot of collectors play them
to relive their childhood.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.890
I'm playing them for like the first time.

05:08.890 --> 05:11.280
Well video games immediately trigger

05:11.280 --> 05:16.280
a lot of nostalgia for childhood
and definitely Christmas.

05:17.020 --> 05:19.470
It makes me think of Christmas, birthdays,

05:20.920 --> 05:23.360
just good warm fuzzy memories.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.630
Makes me think a lot of
times I played with friends

05:25.630 --> 05:28.640
a lot of Mortal Kombat hash outs,

05:28.640 --> 05:30.700
and just brings back a lot

05:30.700 --> 05:32.500
of fond memories for the most part.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.790
So yeah, like I was saying,

05:33.790 --> 05:37.110
I don't know when I started
collecting, it was just me.

05:37.110 --> 05:39.000
I felt like I was the
only person doing it.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.850
I'm sure a lot of people felt that way

05:41.850 --> 05:44.060
but yeah they're out there.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.780
I think video games, for me and probably

05:46.780 --> 05:48.140
a lot of people in my generation,

05:48.140 --> 05:51.480
it sort of defines who we are and it's,

05:52.350 --> 05:54.310
I don't remember a time
in my entire childhood

05:54.310 --> 05:56.400
where I didn't have a video game to play,

05:56.400 --> 05:59.140
you know whether it was
Pong with my father,

05:59.140 --> 06:03.030
or Legend of Zelda or Blaster
Master with my brothers.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.250
I can honestly state that some
of my happiest experiences

06:07.120 --> 06:09.470
in my life have been
connected to video games,

06:09.470 --> 06:13.810
playing video games, the people
I've met through video games

06:13.810 --> 06:15.611
Video games, what are video games?

06:15.611 --> 06:17.250
Never heard of 'em.

06:19.907 --> 06:22.860
Yeah well, it's consumed
my life, that's for sure.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.130
Not a doubt.

06:24.130 --> 06:26.150
Man, to me, video games are,

06:28.040 --> 06:30.660
I mean I don't want to sound
too nerdy, but a way of life.

06:30.660 --> 06:34.970
I mean from an early age I
just fell in love with it.

06:35.855 --> 06:38.630
I've been collecting
games for about 10 years.

06:38.630 --> 06:40.510
Started when I was about 20,

06:40.510 --> 06:41.950
as far as actually not wanting

06:41.950 --> 06:44.010
to resell stuff and keep stuff.

06:44.010 --> 06:48.370
But there's so many games
from like when you were a kid.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.070
And you think you know all these games

06:50.070 --> 06:52.640
but then there's always
another game that comes along.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.670
And it just kind of
surprises you how good it is.

06:54.670 --> 06:57.670
So it's just, I always love discovering

06:57.670 --> 06:59.740
and discovering games
that I didn't know about

06:59.740 --> 07:02.260
or maybe games that I had
just played a little bit

07:02.260 --> 07:04.060
and playing them again as an adult

07:04.060 --> 07:05.880
because it's a totally
different experience.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.980
So I know it might be weird to some people

07:08.980 --> 07:10.510
that I'm collecting stuff that's old,

07:10.510 --> 07:13.040
and to some, archaic, but I actually think

07:13.040 --> 07:14.740
that the main reason that drives me

07:14.740 --> 07:17.310
is when I pick up one of those old games

07:17.310 --> 07:19.810
and look at the label
or look at the box art,

07:19.810 --> 07:20.840
I'm 10 years old again.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.640
I'm back to when I didn't
have to work 60 hours a week,

07:23.640 --> 07:25.110
and didn't have to cut my own grass

07:25.110 --> 07:27.430
and my hugest responsibility
was my homework.

07:27.430 --> 07:30.960
So for me, it's a way to
kind of escape adult life

07:30.960 --> 07:32.670
and just for a little while go back

07:32.670 --> 07:34.350
to when things were less serious

07:34.350 --> 07:35.250
and when things didn't matter.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.830
How long have I been
collecting video games?

07:37.830 --> 07:40.440
Probably most of my life since childhood.

07:42.170 --> 07:46.140
I have been collecting for 17 years now.

07:46.140 --> 07:48.190
So about when I was 11 is when I started.

07:49.470 --> 07:53.250
Now I just turned 38 in September, so 32.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.660
I've been collecting my entire life.

07:55.660 --> 07:58.450
My parents were big gamers,
so I was born into it.

07:58.450 --> 07:59.760
I've been collecting for about

07:59.760 --> 08:03.170
maybe 10 years or so as
a hardcore collector.

08:03.170 --> 08:05.170
I've been playing games
since I was a little kid,

08:05.170 --> 08:08.090
like 4 years old on the
Coleco or the Atari.

08:08.090 --> 08:10.260
Probably since 1987.

08:10.260 --> 08:11.760
Probably a good seven years.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.840
I've been collecting, it'll be three years

08:15.840 --> 08:16.740
this coming March.

08:16.740 --> 08:19.000
I started collecting
toys and then from toys

08:19.000 --> 08:20.980
it just ventured out to retro games.

08:20.980 --> 08:23.800
I've been collecting video games and toys

08:24.880 --> 08:26.340
since I was about eight years old.

08:26.340 --> 08:30.060
So I'd say about 28 years.

08:31.380 --> 08:36.380
Well I got my first Atari
2600 in the early '80s.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.740
So that was 1981.

08:39.690 --> 08:41.610
Yeah, so how old are we now?

08:42.450 --> 08:43.540
Pretty old actually.

08:43.540 --> 08:45.460
So yeah, that's a long
time, you do the math.

08:45.460 --> 08:46.400
I don't know.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.280
I probably started around 10, you know.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.660
But it's hard to exactly say
this is when it all started.

08:54.173 --> 08:55.006
Got that.

08:56.486 --> 08:57.570
I have the phone.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.820
Stuff I'm bringing to my dad's.

09:02.040 --> 09:02.873
Hat.

09:04.900 --> 09:05.733
We're good.

09:07.830 --> 09:09.870
My steering wheel makes noise.

09:09.870 --> 09:11.700
See that's another thing
man, when you're a collector,

09:11.700 --> 09:15.520
all your money, it goes to collecting.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.470
I mean I don't have time to fix my car.

09:18.810 --> 09:21.410
This door over here doesn't
even open but, you know,

09:22.300 --> 09:24.850
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
spend my money on that.

09:25.972 --> 09:30.080
As long as I have gas and it still moves,

09:30.080 --> 09:31.180
the car is good to me.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.870
So many times I'm pulling up here

09:34.870 --> 09:36.880
with a back seat full of games,

09:36.880 --> 09:40.820
peeling off labels, got goodwill stickers

09:40.820 --> 09:44.070
all over the steering
wheel, stuck to my pants.

09:44.070 --> 09:45.250
Just a day in the life.

09:47.170 --> 09:52.170
This horrible monstrosity
of coca-cola crates

09:52.360 --> 09:57.360
are my doubles that I
have got to purge soon

09:57.960 --> 10:01.110
because it's becoming
an earthquake hazard.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.060
This is just embarrassing.

10:04.060 --> 10:04.893
Whoa!

10:06.160 --> 10:09.090
Yeah, the purge has to come
on my doubles very soon.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.050
And you know, that's another
thing, I'm not a single guy,

10:13.050 --> 10:15.590
so having all of this stuff in my house

10:15.590 --> 10:19.820
with a girlfriend, two
kids, a dog, and a cat,

10:19.820 --> 10:22.750
it's like it takes up a
huge chunk of real estate.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.310
I'm planning on taking these
down to a local game store

10:25.310 --> 10:27.700
and see what I can unload hopefully.

10:27.700 --> 10:30.040
Hopefully I can turn a
lot, a huge pile of stuff,

10:30.040 --> 10:31.210
into maybe one or two games.

10:31.210 --> 10:33.530
That's the plan.

10:33.530 --> 10:35.810
Reggie just called me four minutes ago.

10:35.810 --> 10:36.960
Reggie what's going on?

10:38.690 --> 10:39.523
You at home?

10:41.569 --> 10:42.410
I'm gonna put a couple games away

10:42.410 --> 10:44.960
and then I'm gonna head
over to Tacoma to Reggie's.

10:50.288 --> 10:52.640
All right.

10:57.262 --> 10:59.083
Oh, on my collections?

10:59.970 --> 11:02.220
Yeah I've got a count on some of my stuff.

11:03.220 --> 11:07.850
I've got probably around
about 650 NES games.

11:09.410 --> 11:13.860
I just got over the 400 milestone
on PlayStation 2 recently,

11:13.860 --> 11:18.860
which is a very, it's a very big area.

11:19.287 --> 11:22.410
I've got about 200 GameCube games.

11:22.410 --> 11:26.520
Geez, somewhere around 250 PS1.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.160
Some of the more obscure stuff,

11:28.160 --> 11:31.170
I have smaller collections of, like CDI.

11:31.170 --> 11:34.910
Other than my current Er Gen stack here,

11:34.910 --> 11:39.620
I've got like my Wii
U, PS4, some of my PS3,

11:39.620 --> 11:44.450
some of my Wii and some of my Xbox 360.

11:44.450 --> 11:45.770
But even that stuff is,

11:46.950 --> 11:49.990
it's spilling over into my
game room now, at my dad's.

11:52.860 --> 11:54.180
Keys, smokes, phone,

11:57.419 --> 11:58.669
phone, wallet, all right.

12:01.410 --> 12:06.410
So we are off to Reginald
Reggie Williams's house.

12:09.050 --> 12:12.560
He was gonna take a trip
over to Super Smash Games,

12:13.470 --> 12:16.500
his local used video game store,

12:16.500 --> 12:20.610
so I figured I'd join him
since I have so many doubles

12:20.610 --> 12:22.440
and they're bursting at the seams.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.050
I figured let's go with Reggie.

12:26.190 --> 12:28.860
Downsize, man, downsize.

12:28.860 --> 12:31.700
It doesn't happen every day,
so it's kind of a big deal.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.957
We almost ate shit on these
stairs one time, so bad.

12:40.930 --> 12:42.390
My name is Reggie Williams.

12:42.390 --> 12:44.320
Most you guys know me as Radical Reggie.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.080
I am 36 years old, I live in Washington.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.410
Yo, what's up man?
Hey, what's up man?

12:48.410 --> 12:49.920
How you doing, bro?
Good, good, man.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.570
And I would say I've been collecting games

12:51.570 --> 12:52.770
for around 20 years now.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.900
Place looks good.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.130
I know, finally for once, dude,

12:56.130 --> 12:59.650
I finally gave it a little
maintenance and everything.

12:59.650 --> 13:00.880
To be honest with you, video games

13:00.880 --> 13:02.930
are pretty much the heart, you know?

13:02.930 --> 13:06.660
Video games actually remind me of a time

13:06.660 --> 13:09.740
that was really carefree,
if that makes any sense.

13:09.740 --> 13:12.560
It's the time of no responsibility.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.380
Just a good time, laughs, you know.

13:15.380 --> 13:16.650
Clean, dude, that was good.

13:16.650 --> 13:17.910
I know, oh, I should probably turn it on.

13:17.910 --> 13:19.910
It's just like the one Andy had.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.540
Ooh.

13:27.256 --> 13:28.300
That is fancy.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.530
You could only have PlayStation 1

13:29.530 --> 13:30.640
used back in the military,

13:30.640 --> 13:32.520
so now, I've got the official sign

13:32.520 --> 13:33.620
to go with this title.

13:35.180 --> 13:38.810
Oh, that's beautiful, 'cause I can't,

13:38.810 --> 13:39.643
I showed that to my mom

13:39.643 --> 13:42.415
and she's like, whoa,
that's all you needed.

13:42.415 --> 13:44.650
That's right up your alley.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.240
Did you want a console
when you were a kid--

13:55.240 --> 13:56.560
Oh yeah, oh yes.

13:57.598 --> 13:58.570
I wanted one like crazy.

13:58.570 --> 14:01.925
I was always in the arcades
before the consoles came out

14:01.925 --> 14:05.760
and once we got a console,
that kept me out of the arcades

14:05.760 --> 14:07.790
and my parents were
pretty happy about that.

14:09.610 --> 14:12.190
The first console game
I've ever played is Pong.

14:13.230 --> 14:15.300
We used to have an old version of it,

14:15.300 --> 14:17.840
probably not the original pong,

14:17.840 --> 14:20.240
but it was one of the
many, many spin-offs of it.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.060
First memory of video games

14:22.060 --> 14:25.410
is just playing the Pong clone console

14:25.410 --> 14:29.380
that we had when I was a kid
called The Olympian 2600.

14:29.380 --> 14:31.280
I remember a long time ago,

14:32.280 --> 14:36.776
my dad bringing home
like a generic Pong unit,

14:36.776 --> 14:38.780
it was TV scoreboard by RadioShack,

14:38.780 --> 14:40.770
and I remember playing with my brother

14:40.770 --> 14:43.260
it was a two-portion unit and it looked

14:43.260 --> 14:46.450
like a walkie-talkie
with a little sidecar.

14:46.450 --> 14:50.680
Earliest fond memory is playing Sears Pong

14:50.680 --> 14:53.950
on a black-and-white TV with my father.

14:53.950 --> 14:57.830
And then the playing,
definitely, Atari 2600.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.340
I'm pretty sure the first console

14:59.340 --> 15:01.230
I ever played was the Atari 2600.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.650
I mean it was pretty damn
prevalent at the time.

15:03.650 --> 15:05.820
I didn't really know
what the difference was

15:05.820 --> 15:10.550
between that and the Intellivision
and the ColecoVision,

15:10.550 --> 15:12.590
but I remember, you know, the joysticks,

15:12.590 --> 15:14.200
I remember the bad Pac-Man import,

15:14.200 --> 15:15.580
I remember a lot of other games.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.340
My first memory of playing games

15:17.340 --> 15:20.930
was playing a Smurf
Adventure on ColecoVision.

15:21.830 --> 15:23.060
Rescue in Gargamel's Castle.

15:23.060 --> 15:25.780
ColecoVision is still like
very near and dear to my heart.

15:25.780 --> 15:27.760
I have a bunch of ColecoVision stuff.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.360
My fondest memories are of
playing the Intellivision

15:30.360 --> 15:31.193
that I had when I was a kid.

15:31.193 --> 15:33.450
Played it with my friends and
I played it before school,

15:33.450 --> 15:35.790
after school every day for years.

15:35.790 --> 15:37.950
First and fondest memories

15:37.950 --> 15:41.830
is playing Batman on the Commodore 64.

15:41.830 --> 15:44.750
It was a hard game and I beat it

15:44.750 --> 15:47.010
and it was just fun to play.

15:47.010 --> 15:50.270
And also Turrican on the Commodore 64

15:50.270 --> 15:52.170
was a really good game.
Yeah.

15:52.170 --> 15:53.490
I played pong with my brother

15:53.490 --> 15:56.320
and I remember when my brother won or lost

15:56.320 --> 15:57.770
he would turn it off,

15:57.770 --> 15:59.070
he would turn the system off

15:59.070 --> 16:00.410
and like not want to play anymore.

16:00.410 --> 16:02.230
And hiding like an old T-shirt

16:02.230 --> 16:05.240
on top of the Nintendo
deck so mom wouldn't know

16:05.240 --> 16:08.790
the Nintendo was on all
night and leave the TV off

16:08.790 --> 16:13.230
and those are the things we
had to do before game saves.

16:13.230 --> 16:16.490
The younger crowd will never
understand the struggle.

16:16.490 --> 16:17.470
We were kids.

16:20.130 --> 16:22.970
There's no iPads or phones.

16:22.970 --> 16:24.690
My daughter asked me that the other day.

16:24.690 --> 16:27.640
"Daddy, when you were a
kid, do you have an iPad?"

16:27.640 --> 16:28.840
No sweetie.

16:30.795 --> 16:32.820
When I was a kid it was Atari.

16:32.820 --> 16:36.360
I'm gonna have to go all the
way back to the Atari 2600

16:37.290 --> 16:40.890
I clearly remember playing
my brother at Fishing,

16:40.890 --> 16:42.240
Fishing Derby, excuse me.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.470
And yeah, we played a lot of that.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.560
Fishing Derby and Empire
Strikes Back on the 2600.

16:48.770 --> 16:52.140
Yeah I've definitely introduced
some of the older stuff

16:52.140 --> 16:55.360
to the kids and they like it, you know.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.930
My first memories of having
like an Atari was fun

16:57.930 --> 16:59.790
'cause my dad introduced me to that

17:00.840 --> 17:02.560
and we would play some games together

17:02.560 --> 17:05.540
and that, you know, I
think it meant a lot to me.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.760
Well I was born, you see,

17:08.760 --> 17:11.630
into a family that had
an Atari 2600 actually.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.900
For some reason I'm not
nostalgic for the 2600

17:14.900 --> 17:16.620
as much as I am for the NES.

17:16.620 --> 17:19.590
Probably 'cause the NES was
the first console that I got.

17:19.590 --> 17:21.670
The first console that I ever played

17:21.670 --> 17:23.220
was an NES growing up.

17:23.220 --> 17:24.570
I remember it, I was very young,

17:24.570 --> 17:26.700
I was five or six years old.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.690
My parents got one, probably
because it was cheap,

17:29.690 --> 17:31.450
the Super Nintendo was
actually out at that time,

17:31.450 --> 17:34.620
but I was poor, so that's
the console we got.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.570
My friends had video game systems

17:36.570 --> 17:38.760
but I never asked my mom for
one or anything like that,

17:38.760 --> 17:39.960
just went to their house and played them

17:39.960 --> 17:43.710
but for some reason, Christmas,
my mom just surprised me

17:43.710 --> 17:45.710
and got me a Nintendo
Entertainment System.

17:45.710 --> 17:47.370
And I was like, I'm still kind of shocked

17:47.370 --> 17:49.820
to this day about it because
I didn't even ask for it.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.170
She just liked surprising
me with stuff like that.

17:52.170 --> 17:56.180
My first gift I think was a
original Nintendo and Mario.

17:56.180 --> 17:59.230
Actually my earliest
memory is my dad bought us

17:59.230 --> 18:03.080
an NES for Christmas but it turned out

18:03.080 --> 18:04.760
it was actually for him.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.130
My mom was the reason we got a Nintendo.

18:07.130 --> 18:08.440
She wanted Legend of Zelda.

18:08.440 --> 18:12.200
So when that game came
out, we got a Nintendo.

18:15.038 --> 18:16.070
Why would an adult want to play it?

18:16.070 --> 18:18.140
Why wouldn't an adult want
to play Legend of Zelda?

18:18.140 --> 18:20.270
I mean it's just, it's a great game.

18:20.270 --> 18:21.430
And probably,

18:23.240 --> 18:25.460
I mean it's the original,
so probably the best Zelda.

18:25.460 --> 18:27.340
First and fondest memory about video games

18:27.340 --> 18:29.380
was when Woolworth's, which used to be

18:29.380 --> 18:33.600
a chain store out west, they
actually went out of business.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.310
And my dad came home from work one day

18:35.310 --> 18:37.290
and said, hey, I heard they had

18:37.290 --> 18:40.760
these Atari systems on clearance.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.000
Let's go see what that's all about.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.780
So we drove down there that
night, bought an Atari 2600

18:45.780 --> 18:47.690
and I think we bought seven games

18:47.690 --> 18:49.500
because they're so dirt cheap that my dad

18:49.500 --> 18:51.750
just bought one of every one
that they actually had left.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.460
And one of those happened to be Berserk

18:53.460 --> 18:56.410
and I'll never forget the night
sitting there with my father

18:56.410 --> 18:58.630
playing berserk until about midnight.

18:58.630 --> 18:59.880
I mean he let us stay up.

19:01.410 --> 19:03.340
He was as mesmerized as we were, frankly.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.840
We'd never seen anything that cool.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.220
And it was that point where
I was absolutely hooked.

19:20.210 --> 19:22.010
Video games got me through

19:22.010 --> 19:23.759
a lot of rough times when I was a kid.

19:23.759 --> 19:26.540
I moved a lot, I always
was in a different place

19:26.540 --> 19:29.320
in Australia and always went
to like seven different schools

19:29.320 --> 19:30.700
so it was hard to keep friends

19:30.700 --> 19:31.820
when I kept moving all the time.

19:31.820 --> 19:33.940
So video games became my friends.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.900
Going to a Blockbuster or a Video Easy

19:35.900 --> 19:38.410
and renting the next
Zelda or whatever it was

19:38.410 --> 19:40.400
to hang out with me, it sounds sad,

19:40.400 --> 19:42.770
but when I was at home,
and when I was moving,

19:42.770 --> 19:44.360
and when I was traveling so much,

19:44.360 --> 19:45.350
it really helped me get through.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.930
And I've just loved them since then.

19:46.930 --> 19:48.280
Did I ever rent?

19:48.280 --> 19:50.100
All I did was rent games.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.130
I was a normal kid in the '80s.

19:52.130 --> 19:55.340
Renting video games is
probably a bigger part

19:55.340 --> 19:57.580
of the nostalgia of
growing up with video games

19:57.580 --> 20:00.020
than anything else because that's how

20:00.020 --> 20:01.650
I played most of our games.

20:01.650 --> 20:02.790
Every Friday night we'd go over

20:02.790 --> 20:04.720
to my grandmother's
house with my cousin's.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.970
We would rent a video game
and sometimes my cousin

20:06.970 --> 20:08.970
would rent the stupidest
things imaginable.

20:08.970 --> 20:11.010
That's why I've played
a lot of dumb games.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.250
I think I started the
video game rental business.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.100
I can't quantify it, I can't prove it,

20:15.100 --> 20:16.770
you know, none of that stuff's documented,

20:16.770 --> 20:19.160
but in 1984 I was involved

20:19.160 --> 20:20.640
with a company called Video Supreme

20:20.640 --> 20:22.910
on Richmond Road in Lexington, Kentucky.

20:22.910 --> 20:26.060
And I convinced them to
renting ColecoVision games.

20:26.060 --> 20:27.380
You know, and this is
years before the Nintendo

20:27.380 --> 20:28.740
was even out in the States.

20:28.740 --> 20:32.280
And I never saw anybody rent
a game until the NES dropped.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.860
But I don't know for sure,

20:33.860 --> 20:36.440
but if it wasn't the first,
it was one of the first.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.300
Yeah, rental stores were interesting

20:39.300 --> 20:41.470
because it seemed like
within a couple years

20:41.470 --> 20:43.350
they started to pop up everywhere.

20:43.350 --> 20:47.550
So we're talking around '87, '88,

20:47.550 --> 20:49.140
VHS got more and more popular.

20:49.140 --> 20:51.860
Then the prices starting to
come down on the players,

20:52.870 --> 20:55.370
so stores would pop up and
at the time you had to,

20:56.670 --> 20:59.390
you had to pay in to be
a member of these stores.

20:59.390 --> 21:01.760
People don't realize you
had to pay $100, $200

21:01.760 --> 21:04.460
and that's in, $200 in
'88 money, '87 money

21:04.460 --> 21:06.640
to be a member in order
just to have the privilege

21:06.640 --> 21:10.460
of buying or to pay
money to rent this stuff.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.750
Crazed videos, we had Game Crazy,

21:12.750 --> 21:14.980
we had Game Stop, a couple, you know.

21:15.820 --> 21:20.820
Bowman Video and it was
in Cottonwood, California

21:20.940 --> 21:23.570
Custom Top and Video Shop.

21:23.570 --> 21:26.010
Yeah, everything was purple and teal.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.150
It was very hideous.

21:28.150 --> 21:30.600
Oh man, one that sticks out in particular

21:30.600 --> 21:32.840
was called Farmore, it's
not even around anymore.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.440
Yes I did, I rented many games

21:34.440 --> 21:37.130
from a place called Krazy Mike's video

21:37.130 --> 21:38.750
and though they were long gone

21:38.750 --> 21:41.430
but yeah I rented a ton of games,

21:43.450 --> 21:45.280
mostly bad, a few good.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.520
Hollywood Video, Blockbuster Video.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.590
Really, for me it was movie-going.

21:49.590 --> 21:51.710
I mean I felt like--
Movie

21:51.710 --> 21:52.860
Yeah, I feel like in my area

21:52.860 --> 21:54.880
a movie gallery was on like every block.

21:54.880 --> 21:55.713
What?

21:55.713 --> 21:58.540
So then once my broke ass could,

21:58.540 --> 22:01.570
you know, built up this
debt with movie gallery

22:01.570 --> 22:02.574
that I couldn't afford,

22:02.574 --> 22:03.568
Hollywood.
I moved on

22:03.568 --> 22:05.520
to Hollywood Video.

22:05.520 --> 22:09.150
Oh man, I wish that I remember
what that place was called.

22:09.150 --> 22:12.770
It was this tiny little video store

22:12.770 --> 22:15.020
down the street from my neighborhood.

22:15.020 --> 22:18.480
Like I can remember you go in
and on the left were movies

22:18.480 --> 22:20.140
and on the right was porn,

22:20.140 --> 22:23.250
and then you had two glass cases

22:23.250 --> 22:25.790
and the glass cases were
all the games up front.

22:25.790 --> 22:29.160
So like just beeline

22:29.160 --> 22:30.590
to that glass case on the left

22:30.590 --> 22:32.950
'cause that's where
the Nintendo stuff was.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.910
I had a lot of NES games.

22:34.910 --> 22:37.000
We actually rented out our games

22:37.000 --> 22:39.050
to the other kids in the neighborhood.

22:39.050 --> 22:40.310
We had a little sheet where we put

22:40.310 --> 22:42.920
the name of the kid and we charged them

22:42.920 --> 22:43.990
I don't remember how much it was,

22:43.990 --> 22:46.290
maybe two dollars to rent
the game for a night.

22:46.290 --> 22:50.270
So we were actually the rental
store in my neighborhood

22:50.270 --> 22:51.720
Did you ever return your games?

22:51.720 --> 22:53.300
Well, no, that's why I ended up with,

22:53.300 --> 22:54.133
you know.
All right.

22:54.133 --> 22:56.410
I have a bad temper when I'm playing games

22:56.410 --> 22:57.840
Oh you were breaking them, I get it.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.430
You break one game they
wanna charge you $50.

23:00.430 --> 23:04.230
So you just move on to the
next rental place, I guess.

23:04.230 --> 23:06.700
Zelda, dude, it was all
about Zelda back then.

23:06.700 --> 23:09.330
It's like Zelda was
something that I rented

23:09.330 --> 23:11.890
and I rented it so much,

23:13.843 --> 23:15.210
these kids they don't know

23:15.210 --> 23:19.121
because I would rent that
thing over the weekend,

23:19.121 --> 23:20.220
you know, they were closed on Sunday.

23:20.220 --> 23:22.260
You get like an extra day, give it back

23:22.260 --> 23:24.400
on like Monday morning or whatever

23:24.400 --> 23:26.760
and then rent it again the next Friday

23:26.760 --> 23:27.780
and you had to sign up.

23:27.780 --> 23:30.160
There were signups, I don't
know if everybody else had that.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.700
Like you would sign up,

23:31.700 --> 23:33.110
there was like a reserve list

23:33.110 --> 23:35.610
for certain games and
Zelda was one of them.

23:35.610 --> 23:39.470
I would go back the next
weekend and get it thinking

23:39.470 --> 23:41.390
that I would be able to complete my game

23:41.390 --> 23:42.820
and like, no, it already been rented

23:42.820 --> 23:44.550
like two more times during the week.

23:44.550 --> 23:48.050
My games gone, it's like you
know, John has erased mine

23:48.050 --> 23:50.090
and so like now I'm erasing John's.

23:50.090 --> 23:52.250
So rental stores were,
I think, were integral

23:52.250 --> 23:55.320
in getting kids to try new games.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.620
Otherwise, unless you
trade with your friends,

23:57.620 --> 23:59.080
there was no way to discover
all these new games,

23:59.080 --> 24:00.730
'cause you couldn't afford them.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.270
Yeah, we rented video games all the time.

24:02.270 --> 24:04.440
It was a cheap way to be able to play.

24:05.598 --> 24:08.380
I didn't grow up with a lot of money.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.170
We got video games basically
on special occasions,

24:11.170 --> 24:13.130
birthday, Christmas, things like that,

24:13.130 --> 24:16.160
so you know if we, report cards.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.530
That was kind of incentive
for us to keep our grades up.

24:19.530 --> 24:20.660
You know our parents would take us

24:20.660 --> 24:23.180
to the video rental store
and we'd rent video games.

24:23.180 --> 24:25.560
I remember going to Magic Star Video,

24:25.560 --> 24:28.050
which might have lasted
three years, four years.

24:28.050 --> 24:29.370
These places went under quickly.

24:29.370 --> 24:30.640
'Cause there's too many of them.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.950
Every other one is gone and forgotten.

24:32.950 --> 24:35.100
Mom-and-pop shops don't tend to make it.

24:36.280 --> 24:37.840
I can't even express in words

24:37.840 --> 24:40.560
the excitement once Friday came around

24:40.560 --> 24:43.410
you would go to the video
store, rent a video game.

24:43.410 --> 24:47.400
And that entire weekend was
set just because of that game,

24:47.400 --> 24:50.660
or destroyed because the
game sucks, whichever.

24:50.660 --> 24:55.520
But the point is that's
a very big part of my,

24:55.520 --> 24:58.040
whenever I look back,
that's a very big part

24:58.040 --> 24:59.720
of the whole gaming experience

24:59.720 --> 25:03.640
is just sitting in a,
either like a rental store

25:03.640 --> 25:07.180
or a Blockbuster and just
looking at the box art of a game

25:07.180 --> 25:08.680
and not knowing anything about it,

25:08.680 --> 25:10.530
not knowing if the game is good, bad,

25:10.530 --> 25:12.950
you just see the box cover
and then turn it around

25:12.950 --> 25:13.783
to see the game play.

25:13.783 --> 25:15.190
And you're like, oh this looks awesome.

25:15.190 --> 25:16.180
And then just trying to pick

25:16.180 --> 25:17.830
what you wanna play that weekend.

25:19.043 --> 25:19.876
I miss that.

25:19.876 --> 25:21.520
I miss that because that's gone away.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.240
You'll never see that again, you know,

25:23.240 --> 25:26.400
everything's going digital and
nobody rents games anymore.

25:28.958 --> 25:30.430
I mean it's gone for good.

25:30.430 --> 25:34.780
I rented games weekly from
a store called Video Worlds.

25:34.780 --> 25:37.870
I just loved the whole idea
of going into the store,

25:37.870 --> 25:40.190
browsing through, you
know, selecting something

25:40.190 --> 25:42.300
and bring it back next week
to get something brand-new.

25:42.300 --> 25:45.990
like the concept to me, as
a kid, was just amazing.

25:45.990 --> 25:48.270
It was this one right here,

25:49.610 --> 25:51.010
the one that says For Lease.

25:52.340 --> 25:53.450
That was Video World.

25:57.020 --> 25:59.160
And now it's a Park Ridge restaurant.

26:12.740 --> 26:15.850
How and why did I start collecting games?

26:15.850 --> 26:17.670
Video game collecting
seems to affect people

26:17.670 --> 26:19.580
because it's like picking up

26:19.580 --> 26:20.910
all the pieces of your childhood

26:20.910 --> 26:21.970
and putting them back together.

26:21.970 --> 26:24.270
So it's a lot of things
you remembered as a kid

26:24.270 --> 26:25.580
but it's also things you didn't remember

26:25.580 --> 26:27.330
like where was I when this came out.

26:27.330 --> 26:29.280
Basically everybody, when
they get to a certain age,

26:29.280 --> 26:32.650
I think kind of starts missing
their childhood to a degree.

26:32.650 --> 26:36.040
You start thinking about
things that they grew up with

26:36.040 --> 26:39.010
and for me the things,
one of the biggest things

26:39.010 --> 26:40.710
that I grew up was video games.

26:40.710 --> 26:43.480
Video games affected me very personally

26:43.480 --> 26:47.220
because when I was younger my
parents went through divorce

26:47.220 --> 26:48.900
as I'm sure many kids did,

26:50.980 --> 26:54.310
and for me it was sort
of a bit of a solace away

26:54.310 --> 26:57.800
from the process of my parents
going through a divorce.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.740
So I sort of latched on to video games

27:00.800 --> 27:03.310
and in sort of a manner of speaking

27:03.310 --> 27:07.650
it sort of carried me through
that, sea of hurt really.

27:07.650 --> 27:09.370
Remembering a few classic games

27:09.370 --> 27:11.100
that I really wanted to play

27:11.100 --> 27:13.150
and I don't know if it had
to do with me having children

27:13.150 --> 27:15.780
and like, hey, getting
that nostalgia feeling.

27:17.655 --> 27:20.658
It's a great way to
rekindle your childhood

27:20.658 --> 27:22.790
and I think that's something that,

27:22.790 --> 27:24.920
aside from this hobby,
this transcends this hobby

27:24.920 --> 27:27.970
we all want to go back
to that simple time,

27:27.970 --> 27:30.850
and for me, capturing those
video games that I had

27:30.850 --> 27:32.276
really gave me that feeling.

27:32.276 --> 27:35.250
It's definitely a lot to
do with memories for me.

27:35.250 --> 27:40.010
Even more than memories,
it was the feeling I had

27:40.010 --> 27:42.330
of security, so that was huge for me.

27:42.330 --> 27:45.120
So it kind of sparked the nostalgia

27:45.120 --> 27:48.410
and the security I felt, you
know, based on the comfort

27:48.410 --> 27:49.680
that they provided me when I was younger.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.690
So yeah, flipping through
old Nintendo Powers

27:53.690 --> 27:55.360
or a Nintendo Fun Club News,

27:55.360 --> 27:58.550
those are great ways to
kind of rekindle the spirit

27:58.550 --> 28:00.580
of what we experienced
when we were younger.

28:00.580 --> 28:03.260
I was young, you know, grew up poor,

28:04.430 --> 28:05.880
started from the very bottom.

28:07.270 --> 28:10.820
My ma worked three jobs
and I didn't have a father.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.690
So I think I moved to collecting

28:13.690 --> 28:16.200
to find that security or whatever.

28:16.200 --> 28:19.110
Back in the late '70s all my friends

28:19.110 --> 28:22.380
were collecting baseball
cards and stuff like that.

28:22.380 --> 28:25.270
And it didn't really interest me.

28:25.270 --> 28:29.290
And so when Atari 2600 came out,

28:29.290 --> 28:30.350
I bought a couple of games.

28:30.350 --> 28:34.160
And I was like, hey, I'm
gonna start collecting this.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.850
We were at a flea market.

28:35.850 --> 28:37.610
Treasure Isle.
No, Turtle Creek.

28:37.610 --> 28:39.120
Turtle Creek.
Turtle Creek flea market.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.680
You're right.
To be exact.

28:40.680 --> 28:41.630
And I walk in this booth

28:41.630 --> 28:43.950
while they're all eating
lunch in the food court.

28:44.961 --> 28:48.170
Who eats food at a food court
at a flea market, anyways?

28:48.170 --> 28:51.720
But I go in this store and I
see all these these old games

28:51.720 --> 28:54.000
that's bringing back memories
from when I was younger.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.110
I was like, man, why don't
I play these games anymore?

28:57.110 --> 28:59.060
Started working at a video game store

28:59.060 --> 29:02.340
when I was in college and I was like,

29:02.340 --> 29:03.260
oh, these games come in

29:03.260 --> 29:05.450
and I can just buy them with a discount.

29:05.450 --> 29:07.840
And then that kind of exploded from there.

29:07.840 --> 29:11.410
And when I got into
college it was more like,

29:11.410 --> 29:13.450
now I've got a little
bit of disposable income

29:13.450 --> 29:15.930
and I'm going after games that, like,

29:15.930 --> 29:18.840
maybe my parents didn't get me
as a kid but I really wanted.

29:18.840 --> 29:22.360
So now it's my chance to
like experience all the stuff

29:22.360 --> 29:23.960
that maybe I read about in Nintendo Power,

29:23.960 --> 29:26.090
but nobody ever had a
copier, I didn't rent it,

29:26.090 --> 29:27.920
or nobody had it, you know, it to rent.

29:27.920 --> 29:30.700
Like E.V.O., like nobody
had that game growing up.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.900
So I've been collecting
for over 30 years now.

29:33.900 --> 29:37.160
But it was really a small,
sort of personal collection.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.860
It really wasn't until I
started Winterion Games Studios

29:39.860 --> 29:41.630
that I started expanding out a little bit

29:41.630 --> 29:43.840
when it became more about
the curation, the education,

29:43.840 --> 29:45.150
when we started approaching the medium

29:45.150 --> 29:46.700
a little more critically,

29:46.700 --> 29:49.140
that's when it made sense
to start a collection.

29:49.140 --> 29:51.610
I always tell people I sold Contra

29:51.610 --> 29:53.310
for money for a sandwich.

29:53.310 --> 29:54.730
I'll never remember that sandwich

29:54.730 --> 29:57.080
but I'll always remember Contra.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.590
The collecting came back
for me when I started doing

29:59.590 --> 30:01.370
the Angry Video Game Nerd episodes

30:01.370 --> 30:03.990
because then people start sending me games

30:03.990 --> 30:05.780
or then it just became a necessity also

30:05.780 --> 30:08.040
to be able to review the games,

30:08.040 --> 30:09.050
I needed to have the game.

30:09.050 --> 30:11.830
So that would become a whole
new level of collecting

30:11.830 --> 30:13.580
and then it just, then
it also became a set.

30:13.580 --> 30:16.580
So you see the nerd and you
see the games behind him

30:16.580 --> 30:18.120
and everything, it's part of the show.

30:18.120 --> 30:21.270
Collecting is an important
part of the show.

30:21.270 --> 30:24.510
So that's where it
really came back for me.

30:24.510 --> 30:27.620
With the advent of eBay
and the online marketplace

30:27.620 --> 30:29.880
you could get online
and find all these games

30:29.880 --> 30:31.240
that you could never afford as a kid

30:31.240 --> 30:36.240
for $2.00, $3.00, $5.00,
some cases even $10

30:36.310 --> 30:38.800
and I quickly realized, you
know, 'cause I was all grown up,

30:38.800 --> 30:42.190
had my own job and figured
out, hey, I could go buy

30:42.190 --> 30:44.240
all of the games, wouldn't that be cool.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.500
Then I could play every single game

30:45.500 --> 30:46.850
that I never got to play as a kid.

30:46.850 --> 30:48.220
You know, thinking back, I don't know

30:48.220 --> 30:50.000
what made me wanna like keep doing it

30:50.000 --> 30:52.190
because when you have other people

30:52.190 --> 30:54.020
that are interested and
they think it's cool,

30:54.020 --> 30:56.030
then it kind of motivates you to collect.

30:56.030 --> 31:00.120
For me it was a, like again,
I started buying and selling

31:00.120 --> 31:02.720
and trading in the mid to late '90s.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.650
And it wasn't until after
a while where I realized,

31:04.650 --> 31:06.550
hey, I have a pretty nice
collection of games here.

31:06.550 --> 31:08.080
And then when I had friends
that would come over

31:08.080 --> 31:10.400
saying like, wow, you have a lot of games

31:10.400 --> 31:11.940
I grew up with 10 or 15 of them.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.440
And here I have piles of them.

31:14.410 --> 31:16.570
So the more that happened,
the more that it fed my ego

31:16.570 --> 31:18.420
and I was like, okay, well you know,

31:18.420 --> 31:20.070
you think that's impressive,
let's see how big

31:20.070 --> 31:23.167
we can make this pile the
next time you come over.

31:40.750 --> 31:41.583
Hey, kid.

31:43.030 --> 31:44.950
Do you like video games?

31:44.950 --> 31:46.150
Hey, I'm talking to you.

31:47.250 --> 31:49.950
Do you want the largest
selection of video games ever?

31:51.040 --> 31:52.570
Well, what are you waiting for?

31:54.421 --> 31:56.770
Come on down to the
tri-state areas largest

31:56.770 --> 31:59.830
and most radical video
game store there is.

31:59.830 --> 32:00.930
Video Game Junkies!

32:02.010 --> 32:03.060
We've got it all.

32:03.060 --> 32:05.087
And if we don't have it,

32:05.087 --> 32:08.813
you don't need it!

32:08.813 --> 32:10.970
Video Game Junkies!

32:10.970 --> 32:13.430
Located off I-296, exit 203.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.280
Next to The Movie Kingdom in Belmont.

32:17.890 --> 32:21.560
When you collect retro
games it's basically

32:21.560 --> 32:25.170
finding games that are
no longer in production

32:26.010 --> 32:29.190
or that are, you know,
kind of hard to find.

32:29.190 --> 32:31.540
It's not like you can walk into a Best Buy

32:31.540 --> 32:33.400
and buy an NES game.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.670
My name is Carolyn Rodriguez.

32:41.670 --> 32:43.690
I'm an assistant professor of psychiatry

32:43.690 --> 32:47.120
and behavioral science here
at Stanford University.

32:47.120 --> 32:51.090
The focus of my research is
developing new treatments

32:51.090 --> 32:54.810
for obsessive-compulsive
disorder, also called OCD,

32:54.810 --> 32:57.640
and the newly identified
hoarding disorder.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.990
Certainly one of the things that I find

33:00.940 --> 33:03.820
that I admire most about collectors

33:03.820 --> 33:08.100
is their determination, their focus,

33:08.100 --> 33:12.830
their energy on really
curating a collection.

33:17.210 --> 33:19.160
When you're invited to someone's home

33:19.160 --> 33:21.710
and you see a collection,
whether it be video games

33:21.710 --> 33:25.880
or anything else, you
really, as the person

33:25.880 --> 33:27.870
who is looking upon that collection,

33:27.870 --> 33:32.210
you can't help but really
admire the thoughtfulness

33:32.210 --> 33:34.470
of how these different
components of the collection

33:34.470 --> 33:37.410
are playing together and the
time period and the theme.

33:40.390 --> 33:42.570
I met a few key guys in the Seattle area.

33:42.570 --> 33:45.118
My buddy, Casey, you
know he was telling me,

33:45.118 --> 33:46.800
oh man, I'm a big collector.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.380
And I'm thinking to myself, there's no way

33:48.380 --> 33:50.450
he can be bigger than me.

33:50.450 --> 33:52.610
Until he showed some photos and I'm like,

33:52.610 --> 33:54.780
oh my god, it is possible, you know.

33:55.650 --> 33:58.726
Then you start hearing about
other people in the community

33:58.726 --> 33:59.990
like the Immortal John Hancock

33:59.990 --> 34:01.360
and you're like, dear God,

34:01.360 --> 34:03.210
how can anyone have that many games.

34:03.210 --> 34:04.420
That's just insanity.

34:05.380 --> 34:07.350
I come from a family of collectors.

34:07.350 --> 34:11.872
My mom collected like Coke,
Coca-Cola products and dolls.

34:11.872 --> 34:13.720
And I used to go to the flea market

34:13.720 --> 34:16.360
with my mom when I was a child.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.710
And I first started with baseball cards.

34:18.710 --> 34:19.970
I was collecting baseball cards

34:19.970 --> 34:22.460
when that was popular in the '80s.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.360
And then cards moved to comics,

34:24.360 --> 34:26.830
and comics moved to action figures.

34:26.830 --> 34:29.230
But the problem I had was collecting is,

34:29.230 --> 34:31.680
I was looking at these
things in the package.

34:31.680 --> 34:34.440
I collected a lot of action
figures for Star Wars,

34:34.440 --> 34:37.880
especially when the Power of
the Force 2 line came out.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.230
I couldn't do anything with them.

34:39.230 --> 34:41.130
It was like, okay, this is fun.

34:41.130 --> 34:43.050
But I noticed that a lot of people

34:43.050 --> 34:44.720
were selling video games really cheap

34:44.720 --> 34:46.650
at flea markets and stuff.

34:46.650 --> 34:49.990
I was getting more interested in that.

34:50.972 --> 34:52.720
When I came to being in college

34:52.720 --> 34:54.680
and I had a slight disposable income,

34:54.680 --> 34:57.140
you know 20 bucks here and there,

34:57.140 --> 34:59.870
I started collecting Nintendo cartridges

35:00.845 --> 35:01.900
going to flea markets or stores

35:01.900 --> 35:04.440
and chump change and collecting that.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.660
And so that's really when it started,

35:06.660 --> 35:08.810
I started collecting
video games back then.

35:09.690 --> 35:11.910
I found it as an inexpensive hobby, ha-ha.

35:14.190 --> 35:17.500
Collecting and finding a lot of fun

35:17.500 --> 35:19.770
out of playing some real classic games.

35:19.770 --> 35:21.750
Oh my goodness, yeah, I couldn't imagine,

35:21.750 --> 35:23.910
like I find it hard to just put away three

35:23.910 --> 35:26.030
or four different games
when I get to my place

35:26.030 --> 35:27.130
in alphabetical order.

35:28.050 --> 35:30.080
I couldn't even imagine that.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.140
Having games in front of games.

35:32.140 --> 35:33.650
So this is my Sega wall.

35:33.650 --> 35:36.510
And it goes all the way down there.

35:37.420 --> 35:40.340
Every Master System game including,

35:40.340 --> 35:42.410
recently I won this in an auction.

35:43.420 --> 35:48.420
Sonic including Sonic with
the UPC label variation.

35:49.630 --> 35:53.900
Every Sega Genesis game,
CIB in alphabetical order.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.780
I have a lot of oddball stuff as well.

35:57.770 --> 36:02.200
Every 32x game, including
a Spider-Man Web of Fire,

36:02.200 --> 36:04.260
which right here's the hard one.

36:04.260 --> 36:07.700
About 50 games short of
a Sega Saturn selection.

36:07.700 --> 36:10.400
But I have a complete
Sega Dreamcast collection.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.220
PlayStation long box set complete.

36:15.290 --> 36:17.570
A lot of fun collecting that.

36:17.570 --> 36:20.190
Over 900 PlayStation 1 games.

36:20.190 --> 36:21.230
I got PS2, Xbox.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.960
The Sega Genesis is kind
of my pride and joy.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.300
I'm kinda known as the Sega collector

36:26.300 --> 36:28.460
but as you can see I collect everything.

36:29.320 --> 36:33.700
I have about 24 complete collections

36:33.700 --> 36:37.920
with a few others that
I'm like one or two away

36:37.920 --> 36:39.370
that are really hard to find.

36:41.150 --> 36:42.820
I started collecting games seriously

36:42.820 --> 36:46.390
about 20 years ago and
having what I have now

36:46.390 --> 36:48.500
I never would have imagined that

36:48.500 --> 36:51.710
For any collector of anything,
if you can't display it

36:51.710 --> 36:54.938
then you should probably
think twice about it.

36:54.938 --> 36:58.820
And you got to keep it nice.

36:58.820 --> 37:01.780
I mean that's what being
a collector is all about.

37:02.619 --> 37:06.300
I've kind of categorized like Konami games

37:06.300 --> 37:07.820
and then the Capcom games.

37:07.820 --> 37:09.410
I like how kind of look uniform,

37:09.410 --> 37:11.670
like they have the black box games.

37:11.670 --> 37:14.600
If I alphabetized it, I
wouldn't be able to do that.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.750
You know, I was like, you know what?

37:15.750 --> 37:17.350
I really wanna go and try to get

37:17.350 --> 37:19.150
this entire library of games,

37:19.150 --> 37:20.870
just to experience everything

37:20.870 --> 37:23.120
that this system had to
offer back in the day

37:23.120 --> 37:25.440
that I couldn't do when I was a child.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.790
Yeah, there's not that
much that I don't have

37:27.790 --> 37:32.110
that kind of fits in my
narrow focus of collecting.

37:32.110 --> 37:35.660
I mean I still have probably
a hundred Atari 2600 games

37:35.660 --> 37:38.310
and 50 ColecoVision games but besides that

37:38.310 --> 37:42.240
there's only a handful that I don't have.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.290
I don't know what really
drove me in the beginning

37:44.290 --> 37:47.370
besides just the thought
of, you know it'd be cool

37:47.370 --> 37:50.300
to have a full set of NES
games, I grew up with it,

37:50.300 --> 37:53.140
and it'd be neat to have that someday.

37:53.140 --> 37:56.248
I had a conversation with my old lady.

37:57.250 --> 37:59.160
I broached the topic with her about,

38:00.020 --> 38:01.220
hey, I've got this idea.

38:02.090 --> 38:03.200
I'm thinking about trying to get

38:03.200 --> 38:04.630
one of every Nintendo game.

38:05.650 --> 38:08.060
Are you okay with that?

38:08.060 --> 38:10.320
She was and so that was
kind of the beginning of it

38:10.320 --> 38:12.870
It was just looking at the
shelf and like questioning

38:12.870 --> 38:15.040
like, I wonder how many there are?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.660
Not even being that deep into it

38:17.660 --> 38:19.970
but then like that was what started it,

38:19.970 --> 38:21.810
was just that question:

38:21.810 --> 38:22.890
how many are there?

38:22.890 --> 38:24.600
I mean once I joined Nintendo age

38:24.600 --> 38:26.810
and saw people were going for full sets

38:26.810 --> 38:28.920
and that was like a thing I decided.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.610
Yeah, I want full sets
of my favorite system

38:31.610 --> 38:33.190
so I have 'em preserved forever.

38:33.190 --> 38:35.190
My kids can play 'em one day.

38:35.190 --> 38:36.310
You know, they won't have to pay

38:36.310 --> 38:39.150
hundreds of dollars on eBay for them.

38:39.150 --> 38:43.360
Do I ever think I would ever
wanna own 800 NES games?

38:45.090 --> 38:46.560
The thoughts come through my mind

38:46.560 --> 38:48.680
but I keep thinking to myself

38:48.680 --> 38:51.290
like, how am I gonna play 800 NES games?

38:57.130 --> 38:58.290
Aw, man.

39:03.184 --> 39:04.520
The Holy Grail as far,

39:04.520 --> 39:05.980
my Holy Grail, what would that be,

39:05.980 --> 39:08.370
is game console game that I want.

39:08.370 --> 39:10.580
I mean right now, the freaking,

39:10.580 --> 39:14.640
the Cool Kids Club game is
Little Samson, let's be honest.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.090
Yeah, I like Little Samson.

39:17.260 --> 39:18.150
Absolutely man.

39:18.150 --> 39:21.120
That's like, you got that
and you're immediately cool.

39:37.440 --> 39:41.140
I think, yeah obviously,
limited runs on games

39:41.140 --> 39:42.600
or late releases have a lot to do

39:42.600 --> 39:44.830
with super expensive copies.

39:44.830 --> 39:46.180
There's Panic Restaurant.

39:48.810 --> 39:52.390
That was a great find for five bucks.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.100
I still just can't believe that,

39:56.007 --> 39:59.460
I'd have had no idea that
I was getting a great deal.

40:00.430 --> 40:03.580
So I saw a collection online

40:03.580 --> 40:06.190
and he had, this guy's collection

40:06.190 --> 40:07.880
looked similar to mine maybe now

40:07.880 --> 40:10.970
and he had a Little Samson

40:10.970 --> 40:13.640
and Panic Restaurant sitting out.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.570
And at the time I'm like,

40:15.570 --> 40:17.800
why does he got Panic
Restaurant sitting there?

40:17.800 --> 40:21.560
So I, you know, look on eBay,
search Panic Restaurant.

40:21.560 --> 40:24.780
It's like, holy crap, you know?

40:24.780 --> 40:26.100
My Holy Grail is on a system

40:26.100 --> 40:28.270
that I had no interest
in while I was growing up

40:28.270 --> 40:30.230
and that's the Sega CD, Snatcher.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.310
I've heard so many people
talk about this game

40:34.310 --> 40:37.950
and how amazing it is and
it is so hard to find.

40:37.950 --> 40:41.010
It is so expensive that
I am unwilling to pay

40:41.010 --> 40:43.190
the hundreds of dollars
that it's gonna cost

40:43.190 --> 40:44.040
to get this game.

40:46.168 --> 40:47.660
Nobody has a complete 2600 collection.

40:49.023 --> 40:51.630
And I doubt anybody ever will.

40:51.630 --> 40:54.390
There's just so many
that there are so few of

40:54.390 --> 40:55.690
that's like one of a kind.

40:56.870 --> 40:59.960
The people that have those
aren't gonna give them up.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.680
But I've never, like some collectors

41:01.680 --> 41:03.560
they'll spend hundreds and hundreds

41:03.560 --> 41:05.120
of dollars on a game, thousands.

41:05.120 --> 41:10.080
Somebody at this very Con
spent $7,000 on a video game.

41:10.080 --> 41:10.913
I save a bit.

41:10.913 --> 41:15.100
I guess the first thing is,
you got my full Nintendo set

41:15.100 --> 41:17.650
and then obviously somebody
out there is gonna say,

41:18.530 --> 41:20.140
full set, do you have Stadium Events?

41:20.140 --> 41:21.600
No, I don't have Stadium Events.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.250
There's the whole, maybe someday.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.050
The same thing with Stadium Events

41:26.050 --> 41:28.696
like I'm never gonna drop that
much money for one of those.

41:50.250 --> 41:51.580
Hey Dave, fancy meeting you here.

41:51.580 --> 41:54.120
Yeah Joe, you too, but
what the hell are we doing?

41:54.120 --> 41:55.680
And why are we in lab coats?

41:55.680 --> 41:56.513
I don't know.

41:56.513 --> 41:59.800
Well the answer, Dave,
is because we are smart.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.490
I kind of feel smart in a lab coat.

42:01.490 --> 42:02.323
Indeed.

42:02.323 --> 42:05.380
In fact we have a
combined IQ of nearly 120.

42:05.380 --> 42:06.880
Wow, that's pretty damn smart.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.314
I have 100, he has probably less than 20.

42:09.314 --> 42:10.600
Anyway

42:10.600 --> 42:14.400
Oh Dave, why is Stadium
Events so crazy rare?

42:15.250 --> 42:16.210
That's a good question, Joe.

42:16.210 --> 42:18.870
and I think the reason is because Bandai

42:18.870 --> 42:21.490
came out with Stadium Events

42:21.490 --> 42:23.340
and at one point Nintendo, somewhere along

42:23.340 --> 42:24.740
the line, said, hey, do you know what?

42:24.740 --> 42:25.950
We want that game.

42:25.950 --> 42:28.080
And they took it and made
it World Class Track Meet.

42:28.080 --> 42:30.520
A game for the Nintendo Power Pad.

42:30.520 --> 42:33.560
And it's okay but people don't care

42:33.560 --> 42:35.180
about World Class Track Meet,

42:35.180 --> 42:37.580
they want to track down Stadium Events

42:37.580 --> 42:39.140
Just because there's not many

42:39.140 --> 42:40.350
of them out there.
Exactly.

42:40.350 --> 42:42.200
And they want it for their shelves.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.670
And they're willing to spend

42:59.670 --> 43:02.170
thousands of dollars for a sports game.

43:02.170 --> 43:03.370
Wow.
Inconceivable.

43:06.830 --> 43:07.990
Can you move it

43:07.990 --> 43:09.490
slightly more toward the wall.

43:11.470 --> 43:13.198
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

43:13.198 --> 43:14.210
There we go!

43:14.210 --> 43:15.750
I was able to pick up a Stadium Events

43:15.750 --> 43:18.660
without spending any money and

43:20.500 --> 43:21.970
a couple other, I mean
I actually had to trade

43:21.970 --> 43:23.690
my entire 2600 collection for it

43:23.690 --> 43:25.830
but, so technically, no.

43:28.030 --> 43:28.863
It's complete in the box.

43:28.863 --> 43:31.360
I believe it's sitting right
over my shoulder, in fact.

43:31.360 --> 43:35.090
I won an auction at the Classic
Gaming Expo, mid-2000's.

43:36.346 --> 43:39.840
I won a very expensive Atari 2600 game

43:39.840 --> 43:41.060
and I won it for $100.

43:41.060 --> 43:43.335
It was in a mystery auction box.

43:43.335 --> 43:46.850
And a gentleman online
wanted the game so bad,

43:46.850 --> 43:51.080
he bought a Stadium Events on eBay

43:51.080 --> 43:54.600
with a sealed Cheetah Man
2 and some other games

43:54.600 --> 43:56.550
and traded it straight across.

43:56.550 --> 43:59.980
So that's my story for getting
Stadium Events for 100 bucks.

43:59.980 --> 44:01.600
Right here, just pull this.

44:03.309 --> 44:04.460
Right there.

44:04.460 --> 44:06.040
That's the U.S. Stadium Events

44:06.040 --> 44:07.650
Wow.

44:07.650 --> 44:08.920
It really bothers me that

44:08.920 --> 44:10.710
I can't say, that's what happens,

44:10.710 --> 44:13.390
I said that I don't remember
somewhere I have a full set

44:13.390 --> 44:17.810
and like it doesn't even, like
layman, the layman now knows.

44:17.810 --> 44:19.990
Oh, do you have Stadium Events?

44:19.990 --> 44:21.210
Why do you know that, dude?

44:21.210 --> 44:23.150
I know that you know nothing about games,

44:23.150 --> 44:24.760
but you know Stadium Events.

44:24.760 --> 44:27.020
You know to ask me, when
I say I have a full set,

44:27.020 --> 44:28.031
do you have Stadium Events.

44:28.031 --> 44:30.000
That pisses me off so much.

44:31.180 --> 44:32.290
You don't want me to do the holy grail?

44:32.290 --> 44:33.570
I can, it's NWC.

44:34.900 --> 44:36.650
I mean it's kind of cliche.

44:36.650 --> 44:39.050
I've got everything that I want, but NWC,

44:39.050 --> 44:40.630
that I can't afford right now.

44:42.050 --> 44:44.990
What about the Nintendo
World Championship carts?

44:44.990 --> 44:46.650
What's the deal with those?

44:46.650 --> 44:49.710
Well at one point,
Nintendo had a competition

44:49.710 --> 44:51.220
which you played three different games,

44:51.220 --> 44:53.552
they're all under a time limit

44:53.552 --> 44:56.060
to see who was the best gamer around.

44:56.960 --> 45:00.710
Finalists to that event
were given gray cartridges.

45:00.710 --> 45:01.790
Ooh.
Yes.

45:01.790 --> 45:02.890
And wonderful gray cartridges,

45:02.890 --> 45:05.324
just like the majority of
the cartridges on the system.

45:05.324 --> 45:10.324
Wow.

45:13.840 --> 45:16.820
But Nintendo also held a contest

45:16.820 --> 45:18.920
in Nintendo Power magazine

45:18.920 --> 45:22.006
which the winners of that
got the gold cartridge.

45:22.006 --> 45:23.490
Ooh.
Yes, just like

45:23.490 --> 45:25.980
The Legend of Zelda cartridges,
these were solid gold.

45:25.980 --> 45:27.050
So, Dave--
Solid gold.

45:27.050 --> 45:28.860
I couldn't go down to
the Lionel Play World

45:28.860 --> 45:30.097
and buy a Nintendo World
Championship cartridge.

45:30.097 --> 45:31.100
No.

45:31.100 --> 45:31.933
At any time, ever.

45:31.933 --> 45:33.770
At any time ever, no.

45:41.750 --> 45:44.560
And Dave, would you pay over
$30,000 for one of these?

45:44.560 --> 45:45.970
No, of course not because--

45:45.970 --> 45:47.390
20,000?
No.

45:47.390 --> 45:48.223
Okay.

45:48.223 --> 45:50.310
Maybe if I was a millionaire,
I'd think about it, but--

45:50.310 --> 45:51.591
I wouldn't.

45:51.591 --> 45:52.820
If I had money to burn.

45:52.820 --> 45:53.830
If I was a millionaire,

45:53.830 --> 45:54.770
I wouldn't have gotten there

45:54.770 --> 45:55.989
by making stupid decisions like that.

45:55.989 --> 45:57.780
But hey, who are we to judge.

45:57.780 --> 46:00.200
If you want to spend your money on that.

46:00.200 --> 46:01.033
More power to you.
Go ahead.

46:01.033 --> 46:02.520
Yes.

46:05.770 --> 46:08.010
One of my biggest regrets in collecting

46:08.010 --> 46:13.010
was not buying, I had three
opportunities to buy a gold NWC.

46:13.100 --> 46:15.390
The first time was for $800.

46:15.390 --> 46:17.800
The second time was for $2,500.

46:17.800 --> 46:21.050
And the third time was for $5,000.

46:21.050 --> 46:22.230
And looking back on that,

46:22.230 --> 46:23.440
and there were three different copies,

46:23.440 --> 46:24.980
I could really kick myself

46:24.980 --> 46:27.900
for not picking up one or all of those.

46:27.900 --> 46:30.150
So that's my biggest regret.

46:31.890 --> 46:33.940
The second to that
would be Stadium Events.

46:33.940 --> 46:36.450
I had multiple opportunities
to buy Stadium Events

46:36.450 --> 46:38.860
for a fraction of what
it would cost today.

46:38.860 --> 46:41.510
So you can only imagine my pain.

46:41.510 --> 46:42.343
What's the going rate

46:42.343 --> 46:44.980
for a copy of the gray cart?

46:44.980 --> 46:47.260
Gray NWC, you know, the price fluctuates.

46:47.260 --> 46:48.790
It kind of depends on
who's in the market to buy

46:48.790 --> 46:50.820
and how many are available.

46:50.820 --> 46:54.520
I would say a good range is
between 12,000 and 17,000.

46:57.460 --> 47:00.020
I don't think 17 has been hit in a while

47:00.020 --> 47:02.320
so I would say it's
probably closer to 12,000.

47:05.160 --> 47:07.750
Same with Stadium Events,
you know, a lot of people

47:07.750 --> 47:09.900
feel that it's close
to a $20,000 game now.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.870
Unless you see sales for that amount,

47:13.870 --> 47:15.710
it's harder to justify

47:15.710 --> 47:16.990
saying it's worth that much.

47:16.990 --> 47:18.320
I'm not anybody to tell anybody

47:18.320 --> 47:19.320
what to do with their money

47:19.320 --> 47:23.160
but if that was me I
couldn't spend that much

47:23.160 --> 47:25.390
on something like that,
I just couldn't do it.

47:25.390 --> 47:29.120
So that doesn't put me in
the position to have regrets.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.500
It goes for $35,000.

47:31.500 --> 47:32.970
Who has that?

47:32.970 --> 47:35.860
If you got $35,000 to spend on one game

47:35.860 --> 47:39.260
to complete your Nintendo
collection, U.S., whatever

47:41.600 --> 47:44.250
35 grand to spend on one
game, you know what I mean?

47:44.250 --> 47:46.820
Are you financially set,
like you have to be.

47:46.820 --> 47:47.730
I don't know, a lot of people say

47:47.730 --> 47:50.160
that people are hoarding
certain copies of games.

47:50.160 --> 47:52.360
I don't think that has too
much to do with it really.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.960
I think it's where we're at right now.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.510
We're at the maturity of the hobby.

47:55.510 --> 47:58.410
And so there are people,
there are investment firms,

47:58.410 --> 48:02.010
that are actually coming in
and buying very high-end games,

48:02.010 --> 48:03.430
like very high-end graded games

48:03.430 --> 48:06.690
for huge amounts of money
and they're sitting on them.

48:06.690 --> 48:10.510
So you know I think there's
always a real possibility

48:10.510 --> 48:12.360
that someone's gonna wake up one day

48:12.360 --> 48:15.960
and find a case of sealed Stadium Events

48:15.960 --> 48:17.700
which actually happened recently.

48:17.700 --> 48:22.342
So you have to be cognizant of that.

48:22.342 --> 48:23.723
Is it true?

48:23.723 --> 48:27.240
I don't know if it's true.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.980
It's a rumor by someone
who's fairly reputable

48:30.850 --> 48:32.880
but that doesn't
necessarily mean it's true.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.630
I haven't seen it with my own eyes.

48:35.810 --> 48:37.130
I think it's there's a very good chance

48:37.130 --> 48:41.860
that there's several sealed
Stadium Events cases out there.

48:41.860 --> 48:42.710
I don't think it's gonna drop

48:42.710 --> 48:43.740
the value of them at all though.

48:43.740 --> 48:46.380
because let's say you have two cases

48:46.380 --> 48:48.280
of sealed Stadium Events, that's 12 games.

48:48.280 --> 48:50.860
Well I think there's only
about 20 complete copies

48:50.860 --> 48:53.440
in the world that I know of, so you just,

48:53.440 --> 48:57.410
you know improved that by 30%.

48:58.378 --> 48:59.720
It's still gonna be very valuable.

48:59.720 --> 49:01.210
So Beanie Babies was interesting

49:01.210 --> 49:04.180
because the creator of
that purposely inflated

49:04.180 --> 49:06.640
the prices by making things rare,

49:06.640 --> 49:08.720
whereas our hobby, things are rare

49:08.720 --> 49:10.830
because we threw out the freaking boxes.

49:10.830 --> 49:12.960
To me it's just like,
yeah, that's great dude.

49:12.960 --> 49:16.300
You spent 10 grand on the
Nintendo World Championship

49:16.300 --> 49:17.640
when you could have spent that money

49:17.640 --> 49:20.550
on something a little bit
more productive in your life.

49:20.550 --> 49:22.563
I mean that, to me, is just like,

49:22.563 --> 49:23.410
I would never spend that much.

49:23.410 --> 49:25.210
Now if I found it for a buck?

49:25.210 --> 49:28.400
Oh I'd brag, I would brag all up and down

49:28.400 --> 49:31.420
the internet that I found an NWC for $1.

49:31.420 --> 49:33.150
I think anybody would.

49:38.130 --> 49:39.320
So what's the plan?

49:39.320 --> 49:41.310
The plan today brothers,
we're gonna go down

49:41.310 --> 49:43.280
to Super Smash Games, you know.

49:43.280 --> 49:44.113
Okay .
See what all they

49:44.113 --> 49:45.300
got down there.

49:45.300 --> 49:47.350
I mean three friends were
able to come together

49:47.350 --> 49:50.500
and make the store work,
that's pretty awesome.

49:50.500 --> 49:53.160
And they're going on their fourth year,

49:53.160 --> 49:55.140
I mean that's pretty sick.

49:55.140 --> 49:56.830
Did you know that Washington State,

49:56.830 --> 50:00.320
there's a ton of games
here, you know what I mean.

50:01.353 --> 50:03.320
I guess there's a ton of games everywhere.

50:03.320 --> 50:04.310
But Washington probably, you know,

50:04.310 --> 50:05.710
'cause of Nintendo and Microsoft here--

50:05.710 --> 50:06.750
Yeah, right.
So you can probably find

50:06.750 --> 50:08.260
some crazy stuff here.

50:08.260 --> 50:10.000
A crate full, yeah I brought some.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.270
You don't mess around, Joe.

50:11.270 --> 50:13.070
Yeah, I needed to have something to show.

50:13.070 --> 50:15.270
We'll go through the PlayStation stuff.

50:15.270 --> 50:16.570
That's your section, right?

50:16.570 --> 50:17.990
Yeah, that's my section right here, man.

50:17.990 --> 50:19.540
They're all there, this is--

50:19.540 --> 50:20.830
Common's right here.

50:21.880 --> 50:24.890
Yeah, I already see a
ton I don't have, too.

50:24.890 --> 50:25.790
Man, do you know that game?

50:25.790 --> 50:28.250
Do you collect Super Nintendo games?

50:28.250 --> 50:29.960
I mean, you can.
Yeah, when I can.

50:29.960 --> 50:32.980
I don't go out of my way,
they're so expensive man.

50:32.980 --> 50:34.868
I think this is like--
Damn, they got a lot.

50:36.548 --> 50:38.100
I still don't have one of those

50:38.100 --> 50:39.550
There's one.
Yeah.

50:39.550 --> 50:42.644
Look at that, they got
a Panasonic Q GameCube

50:42.644 --> 50:43.480
Oh, no way, where?

50:43.480 --> 50:44.740
Right there.
Oh, wow!

50:46.210 --> 50:47.610
That's beautiful

50:48.690 --> 50:50.480
You know, I wish I had got one

50:50.480 --> 50:51.790
back when it first came out, man.

50:51.790 --> 50:54.150
And this played DVDs, I forgot about that.

50:54.150 --> 50:55.270
I don't know if it's region-free,

50:55.270 --> 50:57.110
'cause you could make 'em region-free

50:57.110 --> 50:59.100
If they came out with
this set of the GameCube

50:59.100 --> 51:02.150
I mean, it would have almost
somewhat competed with the PS2.

51:03.200 --> 51:06.241
Such a weird mashup, you know?

51:06.241 --> 51:08.029
Mm-hmm.

51:08.029 --> 51:08.989
I'm lookin' at that.

51:08.989 --> 51:10.900
I'm looking at that Panasonic Q, man.

51:10.900 --> 51:12.090
That thing's shiny.

51:12.090 --> 51:13.270
Callin' them in.

51:13.270 --> 51:15.960
I could do 310 store credit or 246 cash.

51:17.810 --> 51:19.622
Let's do store credit, man.
Cool.

51:19.622 --> 51:20.730
What are you after?

51:20.730 --> 51:23.010
I was after that GameCube,
Panasonic Q, man.

51:25.059 --> 51:26.034
Oh.

51:26.034 --> 51:27.034
Let's do it.

51:31.941 --> 51:36.441
Yeah, that was my intention
to leave with one thing.

51:37.795 --> 51:38.880
That's a good thing to leave with.

51:38.880 --> 51:39.963
Yeah.

51:41.336 --> 51:42.919
I like shiny stuff.

51:44.686 --> 51:45.519
Are you gonna get it?

51:45.519 --> 51:46.537
I'll give you the honors.

51:46.537 --> 51:47.690
Oh, yeah?

51:47.690 --> 51:49.400
Move this real quick.

51:49.400 --> 51:50.560
Oh no, man.

51:52.550 --> 51:53.460
What?

51:53.460 --> 51:54.520
Yeah.
You serious?

51:55.990 --> 51:56.940
Man, you're insane.

51:58.685 --> 51:59.940
Man, it's heavier than I thought.

51:59.940 --> 52:01.870
It's pretty heavy.
Whoa.

52:01.870 --> 52:03.559
Yeah, we put weights in
there to weigh it down.

52:03.559 --> 52:07.640
Yeah!
Man, you go all out, man.

52:07.640 --> 52:09.967
Oh no, this was .

52:09.967 --> 52:10.990
Whoa.
Yeah.

52:10.990 --> 52:12.310
Oh, that's that tall stack.

52:12.310 --> 52:13.143
This is that stuff?

52:13.143 --> 52:14.710
Yeah, some of it.

52:16.725 --> 52:17.940
Yeah, no problem man.

52:20.710 --> 52:22.950
I was just thinking of
all the games I got.

52:22.950 --> 52:23.960
Got 'em for dirt, so.

52:23.960 --> 52:26.521
You know, at the end
of the day it's a deal.

52:26.521 --> 52:28.756
I don't think I could do the store, ever.

52:28.756 --> 52:31.324
I think with my passion is .

52:34.780 --> 52:36.590
Oh man, I mean it's just retail.

52:42.210 --> 52:43.450
You like video games, buddy?

52:43.450 --> 52:44.400
Yeah.

52:44.400 --> 52:47.630
What's your favorite system, retro system?

52:51.200 --> 52:53.240
Like Nintendo, Nintendo 64--

52:53.240 --> 52:54.460
I like PS4.

52:54.460 --> 52:55.350
PS4, yeah.

52:55.350 --> 52:56.660
I play PS4, you know?

52:56.660 --> 52:57.580
Yeah, I like PS4.

52:57.580 --> 53:01.661
I said retro, he still be saying PS4.

53:01.661 --> 53:02.850
I said, what's your favorite retro system?

53:02.850 --> 53:04.090
Uh, you know, that PS4.

53:05.282 --> 53:06.115
You know what's funny, is he

53:06.115 --> 53:07.902
can speak Spanish and he didn't.

53:13.520 --> 53:14.860
It looks very happy.

53:14.860 --> 53:16.140
That's not good.
Buyer said it's

53:16.140 --> 53:16.973
five years old.

53:16.973 --> 53:20.010
No, four years old and .

53:30.610 --> 53:33.860
Pray to the Nintendo God real quick.

53:37.448 --> 53:38.598
Made it worse.

53:40.739 --> 53:41.610
We're gonna have to test this

53:41.610 --> 53:43.704
on an original console.

53:43.704 --> 53:44.790
I can do 45.
Okay.

53:45.670 --> 53:47.610
Go with that then?
45 sounds good.

53:47.610 --> 53:48.800
All right, let's do that then.

53:48.800 --> 53:49.633
45?

53:52.947 --> 53:54.320
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Paul.

53:54.320 --> 53:55.930
Thank you.

53:57.990 --> 54:01.610
So right now I'm taking
Darrin to my storage units

54:02.980 --> 54:04.950
show them what we've
accumulated over the years

54:04.950 --> 54:08.900
from me collecting and
reselling, of course.

54:11.234 --> 54:12.980
How long do you think ?

54:12.980 --> 54:15.720
'96, '96 was the year I really,

54:15.720 --> 54:18.500
really started, like heavy duty.

54:18.500 --> 54:19.350
What do you think it is

54:19.350 --> 54:21.190
that made you start collecting?

54:21.190 --> 54:22.940
Like did you play games growing up?

54:23.965 --> 54:26.809
I have a really heavy
Hispanic side of my family.

54:26.809 --> 54:28.550
Yeah, like that.

54:28.550 --> 54:31.814
Like that, kinda, but not so ghetto.

54:35.521 --> 54:38.810
They would take me out to
what they called segundas.

54:38.810 --> 54:42.062
Which, I'm assuming, is like
a resale shop or flea markets,

54:42.062 --> 54:43.960
, stuff like that.

54:43.960 --> 54:45.460
So they would take me to these places

54:45.460 --> 54:47.960
and it got to the point where

54:47.960 --> 54:50.140
around '96 Nintendo started phasing out

54:50.140 --> 54:52.680
so I would find it for
cheap, like real cheap.

54:52.680 --> 54:54.740
Like she would go to
the, I guess you would

54:54.740 --> 54:57.460
call them back then, like
scratch and dent stores.

54:57.460 --> 55:00.490
Like where they actually
had entire inventory event,

55:00.490 --> 55:02.000
which those are getting
less and less popular.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.950
If you're about as old as I am,

55:03.950 --> 55:06.070
you'll remember those
little holes in the wall,

55:07.500 --> 55:08.650
scratch and in places.

55:08.650 --> 55:10.960
Well find Nintendo games there

55:10.960 --> 55:13.440
with a hole in them, five
bucks brand-new game.

55:13.440 --> 55:14.840
So I'd start buying them up,

55:15.750 --> 55:17.840
birthday money, Christmas money,

55:17.840 --> 55:19.340
and cutting yards and stuff,

55:19.340 --> 55:21.820
that I've almost had a
few complete collections

55:21.820 --> 55:23.690
but something always happens

55:25.124 --> 55:28.276
like this recent one, there was a pastor

55:28.276 --> 55:29.960
in his church that had a stroke,

55:30.876 --> 55:35.140
and I know him very well, personally.

55:35.140 --> 55:37.081
So I donated my entire collection

55:37.081 --> 55:39.960
to fund his bills for the next few months

55:39.960 --> 55:44.000
and that was probably about
five or six months ago.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.480
So now I've recently started again

55:45.480 --> 55:46.460
'cause they're only things,

55:46.460 --> 55:48.490
at the end of the day you
can't take 'em with you.

55:48.490 --> 55:50.770
So I mean of course
you can have them there

55:50.770 --> 55:51.970
and give them to your children's

55:51.970 --> 55:53.600
children's children's children,

55:53.600 --> 55:58.130
or you can help somebody out now.

55:59.560 --> 56:02.120
We try to help people out when we can.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.770
Just 'cause the games are expensive

56:03.770 --> 56:06.240
and we're a store, doesn't
mean I don't want that stigma

56:06.240 --> 56:07.230
of, oh, they're just greedy,

56:07.230 --> 56:10.450
penny-pinchin' bastards, 'cause we're not.

56:10.450 --> 56:12.198
And it's gamers helping gamers.

56:12.198 --> 56:17.198
So naturally, that's what
we do, that's what we are.

56:18.010 --> 56:20.040
It's really interesting going back

56:20.040 --> 56:21.850
from all the stigma I used to get,

56:21.850 --> 56:25.720
'90s, early 2000s, collecting
and stuff like that

56:25.720 --> 56:28.590
and everybody would look
at me like I was stupid.

56:29.780 --> 56:31.360
Now it's just part of pop culture.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.480
So it was actually really
neat to watch that happen

56:33.480 --> 56:35.460
and be a part of something like that.

56:35.460 --> 56:38.670
It's really interesting to
see where this all headed out

56:38.670 --> 56:42.400
because I used to hear so much
shit about grabbing old games

56:42.400 --> 56:45.050
and it was always negative,
negative, negative.

56:46.830 --> 56:49.080
Now it's always like,
oh, you collect games!

56:49.080 --> 56:51.130
And now you're cool, it's really strange.

56:52.262 --> 56:53.370
So I like it.

56:53.370 --> 56:56.200
Doing the game store has been a blessing

56:57.100 --> 56:59.580
because I get to meet people like Darrin.

56:59.580 --> 57:01.020
I get to meet people like Tony.

57:01.020 --> 57:03.120
And I would've never have met these people

57:03.120 --> 57:05.950
if it wasn't for opening a game shop.

57:05.950 --> 57:08.420
And now I get more time with my family

57:08.420 --> 57:10.700
than I ever did before.

57:10.700 --> 57:12.680
It's just really really good to go

57:12.680 --> 57:15.280
from a collector to kind of reselling

57:15.280 --> 57:17.280
'cause you know you're making it so good,

57:17.280 --> 57:20.110
to just opening a store,
getting that idea from then.

57:20.110 --> 57:23.060
It's just a really,
really, really cool thing

57:23.060 --> 57:25.490
that's happened to me and
I'm very grateful for it.

57:25.490 --> 57:27.670
And if any of my customers
or friends are watching this

57:27.670 --> 57:30.246
I freaking love you
guys, every one of you.

57:30.246 --> 57:31.079
Thank you.

57:40.880 --> 57:43.400
The worst thing about
video game collecting.

57:43.400 --> 57:45.380
Worst thing would
probably have to be space.

57:45.380 --> 57:47.190
The worst part is finding space.

57:47.190 --> 57:48.490
Where do I put it all?

57:48.490 --> 57:50.810
Where am I going to put my collection?

57:50.810 --> 57:52.130
Space.

57:52.130 --> 57:55.300
Yeah, space is a killer, man.

57:55.300 --> 57:57.250
I can't even imagine like those dudes

57:57.250 --> 58:00.550
that are branching out and
trying to do like every system.

58:00.550 --> 58:03.360
I mean I'm Nintendo-focused
and you can already see

58:03.360 --> 58:07.620
that like this is a room
in a house and it's gone.

58:08.910 --> 58:10.790
Space, the final frontier.

58:12.930 --> 58:14.060
For every collector.

58:14.060 --> 58:14.893
Budget.

58:16.140 --> 58:20.770
The prices and the way the
prices fluctuated, eBay,

58:20.770 --> 58:24.300
yes, Craigslist, that's the
worst thing about collecting.

58:24.300 --> 58:27.910
The rising prices of the
harder to find games.

58:27.910 --> 58:30.710
I think that's definitely
the downside of it.

58:30.710 --> 58:33.260
This is really generic but the first thing

58:33.260 --> 58:35.230
I'm gonna go with is just the drama.

58:35.230 --> 58:37.030
I've dealt with quite a bit of drama

58:38.010 --> 58:40.370
being a moderator of a Facebook group.

58:40.370 --> 58:42.810
You have to expose a lot of shady people

58:42.810 --> 58:43.643
There's a lot of people out there

58:43.643 --> 58:46.800
trying to take advantage of collectors.

58:49.040 --> 58:51.710
Sell repro, fake games, things like that,

58:51.710 --> 58:53.400
and not send packages at all.

58:54.524 --> 58:57.740
And I don't know man, it
just feels like, you know,

58:57.740 --> 59:00.310
our community is not like,
we're not like bodybuilders

59:00.310 --> 59:02.600
or like bad asses, you know, there's a lot

59:02.600 --> 59:03.950
of vulnerable people out there

59:03.950 --> 59:05.900
that can easily get taken advantage of.

59:06.900 --> 59:11.270
Yeah, I just don't like
the wolves out there,

59:11.270 --> 59:12.590
I think you could say.

59:13.750 --> 59:15.440
I think it should be a little bit more

59:15.440 --> 59:17.540
of a welcoming community, it's not always.

59:19.502 --> 59:21.430
I still have a huge passion for this, man.

59:21.430 --> 59:22.840
I really do love this stuff.

59:22.840 --> 59:25.500
But some of them guys in
them Facebook groups, man,

59:26.890 --> 59:28.380
they kill it, man.

59:28.380 --> 59:29.270
Start reading that crap

59:29.270 --> 59:31.730
and then you just don't
want to do no more.

59:31.730 --> 59:34.460
Like, oh, you like Wrath
of the Black Manta,

59:34.460 --> 59:35.520
you're an idiot.

59:35.520 --> 59:37.550
You know, that kind of elitist.

59:39.190 --> 59:40.770
It's really obnoxious.

59:40.770 --> 59:42.090
I just keep my mouth shut.

59:42.090 --> 59:44.700
I mean, no sense of trying
to be a keyboard warrior,

59:44.700 --> 59:48.860
it's just like hmm man,
you're a douche bag.

59:48.860 --> 59:52.360
There's so many haters out
there on Facebook in the groups

59:52.360 --> 59:54.320
that you just can't be part of it, man.

59:55.790 --> 1:00:00.620
Jealousy is so ugly and you
know, even some of my people

1:00:00.620 --> 1:00:03.000
I consider friends are some jealous people

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.150
and it's just like,
come on, don't do that.

1:00:05.150 --> 1:00:07.300
Every time I get a notification
on one of my posts,

1:00:07.300 --> 1:00:08.330
I don't even want to look at it

1:00:08.330 --> 1:00:11.040
because I know it's somebody
just being an idiot or a jerk.

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.810
People's mentality on there,
like I hate to say it,

1:00:13.810 --> 1:00:15.460
but there's a lot of jerks.

1:00:15.460 --> 1:00:17.220
Like 90% of the people on there

1:00:17.220 --> 1:00:19.240
just believe they know everything

1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:20.620
and instead of helping you out

1:00:20.620 --> 1:00:22.230
and giving you the information,

1:00:22.230 --> 1:00:24.520
they throw it at you as if
you should have known it

1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:26.370
and you're an idiot for not knowing it.

1:00:26.370 --> 1:00:27.930
All right, the worst part about collecting

1:00:27.930 --> 1:00:31.350
is the scumbag resellers,
they're everywhere.

1:00:56.697 --> 1:00:59.879
The term resellers has a
certain connotation to it.

1:01:04.830 --> 1:01:06.670
My thoughts on resellers

1:01:06.670 --> 1:01:08.220
Ah, resellers.

1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:10.360
Anything that gets popular,

1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:12.260
people are gonna try to capitalize on.

1:01:13.140 --> 1:01:14.720
The nasty reseller.

1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:15.640
You know what that is, right?

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:18.330
I don't know if I've heard
it expressed that way before.

1:01:18.330 --> 1:01:20.100
I think they're necessary.

1:01:20.100 --> 1:01:23.250
I mean, like when you go to swap meets

1:01:23.250 --> 1:01:26.360
and when you go to conventions
and there's either stores

1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:28.430
or individuals selling the games,

1:01:28.430 --> 1:01:31.090
they're resellers, for the most part.

1:01:31.090 --> 1:01:32.830
It's a way to feed your hobby.

1:01:32.830 --> 1:01:36.400
Be it on, you know, in person,
trades, conventions, eBay.

1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:39.390
Like, you're gonna have
to feel the fire somehow.

1:01:39.390 --> 1:01:41.330
So I think it's, I don't want to say

1:01:41.330 --> 1:01:43.740
it's a necessary evil, but it kind of is.

1:01:43.740 --> 1:01:45.210
I think it's something
you kind of have to do

1:01:45.210 --> 1:01:46.760
if you're gonna be a collector.

1:01:47.730 --> 1:01:49.750
Yeah, there's two types, yeah.

1:01:49.750 --> 1:01:52.000
The ones that are just
into it for the money.

1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:57.470
I think if you collect as an investment,

1:01:58.620 --> 1:02:00.210
just like it is with any investment,

1:02:00.210 --> 1:02:02.490
you have a chance of it crashing

1:02:02.490 --> 1:02:04.250
I think when people started getting

1:02:04.250 --> 1:02:07.880
into the hobby too much to
flip a dollar to make a buck,

1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:12.810
they're giving the hobby kind
of a black eye, if you will.

1:02:12.810 --> 1:02:15.090
A good seller of a game actually,

1:02:15.090 --> 1:02:16.700
you know, cares about the hobby.

1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:18.650
A guy that's in it,
not just to make money,

1:02:18.650 --> 1:02:20.010
of course everyone wants to make money,

1:02:20.010 --> 1:02:22.830
but actually has the knowledge
of what they're selling,

1:02:22.830 --> 1:02:25.080
can help people about
what they're selling.

1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:28.080
What are these games, like what
actually are in these games.

1:02:29.090 --> 1:02:30.330
Which one's fun?

1:02:30.330 --> 1:02:33.190
why is this one, why does
this one have notoriety?

1:02:33.190 --> 1:02:35.060
Why is this one more money than this one?

1:02:35.060 --> 1:02:36.220
Why is this one rare?

1:02:36.220 --> 1:02:37.960
Why didn't no one buy this one?

1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:39.330
Versus someone who gets into the business

1:02:39.330 --> 1:02:41.700
just to be a profiteer entirely,

1:02:41.700 --> 1:02:43.340
and basically just to go, oh, I know

1:02:43.340 --> 1:02:44.480
how much this goes for an eBay.

1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:48.220
So by finding it for five
bucks I can charge you 35.

1:02:48.220 --> 1:02:50.240
And then act like an asshole.

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:53.310
In our show, we've always
said resellers are bad.

1:02:53.310 --> 1:02:54.800
Fuck resellers, this and that,

1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:57.190
and I wish we never threw
it out there like that

1:02:57.190 --> 1:02:58.280
'cause it's not what we mean.

1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:00.450
Not all resellers are bad.

1:03:00.450 --> 1:03:01.780
It's price gouging.

1:03:01.780 --> 1:03:06.220
It's people just being assholes
just for being assholes,

1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:10.690
charging $30, $40 for
Super Mario Brothers 3,

1:03:10.690 --> 1:03:12.230
just because you can.

1:03:12.230 --> 1:03:14.380
It actually turns people
off from the hobby,

1:03:14.380 --> 1:03:15.213
which is what I don't think

1:03:15.213 --> 1:03:16.640
a lot of these sellers understand.

1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:18.970
That if you put up this elite barrier

1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:22.850
you know, it's like you're
not doing yourself any favors

1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:28.010
and in the long run,
you're turning people away.

1:03:29.050 --> 1:03:31.320
Something is only worth what someone

1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:32.350
is willing to pay for it.

1:03:32.350 --> 1:03:33.560
So if there aren't people out there

1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:36.270
willing to pay X number
of dollars for a game,

1:03:36.270 --> 1:03:38.630
then it's not gonna sell.

1:03:38.630 --> 1:03:42.230
So people drive the demand,
not the other way around.

1:03:42.230 --> 1:03:45.620
It kind of stinks, you know,
having a personal collection

1:03:45.620 --> 1:03:48.020
and wanting to buy for your
own personal collection

1:03:48.020 --> 1:03:52.040
and then being a video
game toy store owner.

1:03:52.040 --> 1:03:55.310
Because, you know from my personal view,

1:03:55.310 --> 1:03:56.880
I don't want to pay a certain value

1:03:56.880 --> 1:03:59.120
or X amount of dollars for a rare game.

1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:01.610
But then I have that same
rare game in my store

1:04:01.610 --> 1:04:04.990
and I have to sell it for that to survive.

1:04:04.990 --> 1:04:05.823
You know what I'm saying.

1:04:05.823 --> 1:04:08.270
So it's kind of, I understand, yeah.

1:04:08.270 --> 1:04:12.380
Even though I'm a reseller,
I see the other side

1:04:12.380 --> 1:04:13.530
like from a collector's standpoint.

1:04:13.530 --> 1:04:16.540
So I think that actually
helps me as a reseller

1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:17.900
because now I'm collecting.

1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:21.330
So I kind of see it from the
other side of the counter.

1:04:21.330 --> 1:04:23.240
I think what really the problem is

1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:26.330
is people that have no
passion for games at all,

1:04:26.330 --> 1:04:29.130
that just see it as a widget
that they can make money on.

1:04:29.130 --> 1:04:31.100
It might as well be a Beanie Baby.

1:04:31.100 --> 1:04:33.950
I think resellers are basically

1:04:33.950 --> 1:04:35.020
in a league of their own.

1:04:35.020 --> 1:04:37.970
They ruin what this community stands for.

1:04:37.970 --> 1:04:40.040
If you're a collector and a reseller,

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:41.190
I don't think that's a bad thing.

1:04:41.190 --> 1:04:43.860
Because honestly, most
collectors that resell

1:04:43.860 --> 1:04:47.520
just resell their dupes
or trade with people.

1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:50.390
It's the resellers that don't
give a shit about video games.

1:04:50.390 --> 1:04:52.650
Good example is the Amiibos.

1:04:52.650 --> 1:04:54.473
Those brought out all the resellers

1:04:54.473 --> 1:04:56.220
and everybody was buying 'em up,

1:04:56.220 --> 1:04:59.530
flipping 'em for a buck
and market crashed.

1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:02.260
But I think people throw around

1:05:02.260 --> 1:05:05.410
the term reseller like way too loosely.

1:05:05.410 --> 1:05:06.970
It's like if you wanna sell your own game,

1:05:06.970 --> 1:05:09.650
that's your prerogative, and
you should be able to sell

1:05:09.650 --> 1:05:12.080
your collection if you want to do that.

1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:14.760
And was this your
collection to begin with?

1:05:14.760 --> 1:05:16.010
Yeah.

1:05:16.010 --> 1:05:17.010
And how long in years

1:05:17.010 --> 1:05:19.540
had you been collecting before?

1:05:19.540 --> 1:05:22.430
I started collecting
about a year or two ago.

1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:25.810
Eventually I stopped.

1:05:25.810 --> 1:05:30.810
Kinda decided I didn't play it as much.

1:05:30.950 --> 1:05:33.880
Decided I wanted to make some money.

1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:36.660
Probably gonna end up
regretting it, honestly.

1:05:36.660 --> 1:05:37.650
I have no problems with people

1:05:37.650 --> 1:05:39.740
trying to make a buck, you know.

1:05:39.740 --> 1:05:42.970
But it makes it more expensive
for people that collect

1:05:42.970 --> 1:05:44.450
'cause it drives the prices up.

1:05:44.450 --> 1:05:47.350
I feel like from a reseller standpoint,

1:05:48.310 --> 1:05:51.970
I think it's bad because
it's so much harder

1:05:51.970 --> 1:05:55.490
to find games to resale.

1:05:55.490 --> 1:05:57.220
From a collector's standpoint--

1:05:57.220 --> 1:05:59.340
It's still harder 'cause
everything's going up.

1:05:59.340 --> 1:06:01.270
Right, but at the same time,

1:06:01.270 --> 1:06:03.310
if you already have a broad collection

1:06:03.310 --> 1:06:05.350
I feel like your value is
just shooting through the roof

1:06:05.350 --> 1:06:07.350
so it's good in that aspect.

1:06:07.350 --> 1:06:08.940
If you even care what
your games are worth.

1:06:08.940 --> 1:06:10.763
I mean I guess at the end of the day--

1:06:10.763 --> 1:06:12.256
We're not gonna sell--
If you're not selling them,

1:06:12.256 --> 1:06:14.590
then yeah, it's not, you know.

1:06:14.590 --> 1:06:17.950
It certainly is not helping
the hobby, by any means.

1:06:17.950 --> 1:06:21.060
Prices get inflated, it makes
it more difficult to collect,

1:06:21.060 --> 1:06:23.060
and it does take some
of the fun out of it.

1:06:23.060 --> 1:06:25.370
I don't like, you know, it's not fun

1:06:25.370 --> 1:06:29.560
to go to a flea market
where someone has a booth

1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:32.250
and the games are all priced
eBay prices, you know.

1:06:32.250 --> 1:06:33.610
That's not fun.

1:06:33.610 --> 1:06:35.030
Yeah, I mean it's true.

1:06:35.030 --> 1:06:37.780
You can't show up to a yard sale or--

1:06:37.780 --> 1:06:40.480
That's true everyone and
their mother has eBay

1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:42.810
and they'll find the
highest Buy It Now price

1:06:42.810 --> 1:06:45.510
for any single game,
they'll look 'em all up

1:06:45.510 --> 1:06:49.260
and then say, well this
game here is worth $50.

1:06:49.260 --> 1:06:50.810
I seen it on the eBay.

1:06:50.810 --> 1:06:53.310
I'm like, ma'am, you know I
don't wanna disrespect you

1:06:53.310 --> 1:06:55.130
but that's a $20 game all day.

1:06:55.130 --> 1:06:56.360
We can't exclude ourself.

1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:57.560
I mean we've shown up to the flea market

1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:00.000
at 5:30 in the morning
buying games to resell

1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.770
and you have collectors
showing in at nine o'clock.

1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:05.100
You're not getting anything, I'm sorry.

1:07:05.100 --> 1:07:07.000
Where do you get your games and stuff?

1:07:07.940 --> 1:07:10.190
Online, you know, private sellers,

1:07:10.190 --> 1:07:13.440
people on Craigslist
offer up like, you know,

1:07:13.440 --> 1:07:18.370
a lot of times it's people
cleaning out a house or something

1:07:18.370 --> 1:07:20.620
or they find a box of games,

1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:22.890
they don't want 'em to
sell 'em low, you know.

1:07:22.890 --> 1:07:25.100
I cleaned out a house two years ago.

1:07:25.100 --> 1:07:28.750
The guy worked for Toys
R Us for like 30 years.

1:07:28.750 --> 1:07:32.550
Dude, he had like Nintendo
games still in boxes.

1:07:32.550 --> 1:07:34.660
Nintendo still sealed.

1:07:34.660 --> 1:07:37.160
The original Gameboy still sealed.

1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:39.230
He just bought the stuff and kept it.

1:07:39.230 --> 1:07:40.980
He was a little bit weird.

1:07:40.980 --> 1:07:44.290
You know, they just wanna buy
it for the cheapest amount

1:07:44.290 --> 1:07:46.250
and sell it for top dollar.

1:07:48.996 --> 1:07:51.360
They're just greedy is all it is.

1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:52.920
I mean if I buy--
Most of 'em

1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:53.900
not all of them though.

1:07:53.900 --> 1:07:55.760
Dude, it's 90% of them.

1:07:55.760 --> 1:07:56.720
Yeah, sure.

1:07:56.720 --> 1:07:59.080
Oh, online it goes for 250.

1:07:59.080 --> 1:08:00.510
Yeah.
That kinda stuff.

1:08:00.510 --> 1:08:02.040
You never know, that's why you gotta ask.

1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:03.450
But you never know.

1:08:03.450 --> 1:08:06.040
Where do you find out
how much the value is?

1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:08.550
eBay sold listings is,
for me, the best way to go

1:08:08.550 --> 1:08:10.230
'cause, you know, you can ask whatever,

1:08:10.230 --> 1:08:12.180
but you guys see what they've sold for.

1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:16.940
I try to price reasonably
with the condition

1:08:16.940 --> 1:08:20.990
and consideration of
Amazon, sometimes eBay.

1:08:20.990 --> 1:08:24.450
Try to do my research for the titles

1:08:24.450 --> 1:08:27.810
and make sure I've got a
competitive priced product.

1:08:29.870 --> 1:08:30.930
Obviously some of them need to go

1:08:30.930 --> 1:08:32.680
a little higher than others.

1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:35.030
There's some that definitely warrant it.

1:08:35.030 --> 1:08:36.930
And there's some that you
just need to let go of.

1:08:36.930 --> 1:08:38.050
Where'd you come up with that price?

1:08:38.050 --> 1:08:39.630
On eBay?

1:08:39.630 --> 1:08:42.680
There's a site that aggregates eBay.

1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:43.540
Oh.

1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:46.190
It like uses eBay, Amazon sold listings

1:08:46.190 --> 1:08:48.460
and it comes up with
like an average value.

1:08:48.460 --> 1:08:49.560
Sure, okay.
Yeah.

1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:52.870
What's that website?

1:08:52.870 --> 1:08:55.160
Video game price charting.

1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:56.980
eBay is a good indicator

1:08:56.980 --> 1:08:59.860
of what something's actually
worth, what they sell for.

1:09:02.273 --> 1:09:05.450
What other vendors are selling
for is a good, you know,

1:09:05.450 --> 1:09:08.610
I mean usually if you look at
what stores sell things for

1:09:08.610 --> 1:09:10.710
it's a little bit higher
than what you're gonna get

1:09:10.710 --> 1:09:12.730
out here, you know.
Yeah.

1:09:12.730 --> 1:09:14.360
We tend to be a little bit,

1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:17.570
maybe $5, $10 low, $5 lower, you know.

1:09:17.570 --> 1:09:19.070
You go inside you'll pay more.

1:09:24.651 --> 1:09:25.484
Oh, check it out, man.

1:09:29.065 --> 1:09:30.080
Is this your place here?

1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:31.300
No I'm just watching for the guy.

1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:32.990
He'll be right back.
Okay cool.

1:09:35.961 --> 1:09:37.020
A little bit of everything, huh?

1:09:37.020 --> 1:09:37.853
Yeah.
Wow.

1:09:40.112 --> 1:09:41.560
Old school.
Yeah!

1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:42.860
Thank god for them, right?

1:09:44.100 --> 1:09:46.460
Like us!

1:09:47.353 --> 1:09:50.179
It's amazing how much these
things are worth today.

1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:54.260
Super Nintendo's getting bigger now.

1:09:54.260 --> 1:09:56.510
Super Nintendo, N64,
they're getting big now.

1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:00.308
GameCube's gonna be the
next in line, getting big.

1:10:00.308 --> 1:10:01.780
Look at how much PS2 I got.

1:10:01.780 --> 1:10:02.920
PS2 hasn't moved that much.

1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:03.870
Not worth anything.

1:10:05.050 --> 1:10:07.035
Super Nintendo, the high-end
Super Nintendo stuff.

1:10:07.035 --> 1:10:07.900
Like that.

1:10:07.900 --> 1:10:09.140
It moves, it moves.
Okay.

1:10:10.420 --> 1:10:11.850
Like that Super Metroid
will probably be gone

1:10:11.850 --> 1:10:13.160
by the end of the day.

1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:15.472
Where do you get your prices?

1:10:15.472 --> 1:10:16.420
How you justify the prices?

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:18.088
We base it off eBay.

1:10:18.088 --> 1:10:21.160
We base it off eBay, we look
at Amazon, too, a little bit.

1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:23.180
How do you guys acquire your games?

1:10:23.180 --> 1:10:24.100
Trade-ins.

1:10:24.100 --> 1:10:24.933
Trade-ins mostly.

1:10:24.933 --> 1:10:25.810
Yep.

1:10:25.810 --> 1:10:29.460
Trade-ins, we'll hunt around
the auctions sometimes outside,

1:10:29.460 --> 1:10:33.562
see if we got anything good.

1:10:33.562 --> 1:10:34.944
Did you see that, by the way?

1:10:36.245 --> 1:10:37.078
Kinda cool.

1:10:37.078 --> 1:10:38.500
The 1982 Zaxxon.

1:10:39.470 --> 1:10:41.620
Shit, I got 30 bucks on me right now.

1:10:41.620 --> 1:10:43.348
There you go, man.

1:10:43.348 --> 1:10:44.181
Dude, could you imagine this--

1:10:44.181 --> 1:10:45.760
Put it in the living room.

1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:46.820
We were just talking about that.

1:10:46.820 --> 1:10:48.920
'Cause, again, we just got together today.

1:10:50.818 --> 1:10:53.095
Tell your wife if she
don't like can move out.

1:10:53.095 --> 1:10:54.930
The only stipulation
for the arcade cabinet,

1:10:54.930 --> 1:10:56.544
the first one has to be Ms. Pac-Man.

1:10:56.544 --> 1:10:57.377
Oh.
That's what she said.

1:10:57.377 --> 1:10:58.850
She's like

1:10:58.850 --> 1:11:00.290
Not the table units for either.

1:11:00.290 --> 1:11:02.090
Zaxxon's a better unit.

1:11:02.930 --> 1:11:04.351
Hey man, happy wife, happy life, sorry.

1:11:05.630 --> 1:11:08.307
Tell me you don't like
it, here's the door.

1:11:08.307 --> 1:11:10.484
She's on a--
Yeah.

1:11:10.484 --> 1:11:11.317
That's what I say to mine all the time,

1:11:11.317 --> 1:11:13.960
you don't like it, here's
the door, walk out.

1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:15.480
Door's unlocked, go ahead.

1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:16.313
See ya.

1:11:17.970 --> 1:11:20.040
Like everywhere on this planet,

1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:23.550
there's rude people in
the gaming world, too,

1:11:24.410 --> 1:11:26.000
that don't believe in the community

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.660
and just wanna make a quick buck.

1:11:28.660 --> 1:11:29.760
Cool for them.

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:31.310
I don't do business with you.

1:11:31.310 --> 1:11:34.115
So it's kinda, a reseller in
your definition of a reseller,

1:11:34.115 --> 1:11:37.260
I think they're pieces of shit.

1:11:37.260 --> 1:11:39.030
To me, if you want eBay prices,

1:11:39.030 --> 1:11:41.190
you should be selling your stuff on eBay,

1:11:41.190 --> 1:11:42.580
not at a flea market.

1:11:42.580 --> 1:11:43.880
You don't have to pay eBay fees.

1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:46.990
You don't have to go through
the trouble of shipping it.

1:11:46.990 --> 1:11:48.700
And I see it all the time, unfortunately.

1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:50.270
I'll go to a flea market
and I'll see somebody

1:11:50.270 --> 1:11:52.940
with not only eBay prices,
but higher than eBay prices.

1:11:52.940 --> 1:11:56.370
And it's kind of discouraging,

1:11:56.370 --> 1:11:58.440
but at the same time you just

1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:01.040
gotta keep being persistent about it.

1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:03.430
The nice thing about resellers
is if you want a game

1:12:03.430 --> 1:12:05.430
and you wanna play it, you can find it.

1:12:05.430 --> 1:12:07.960
You know, before I'd
spend six, seven years

1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:09.770
looking for something and
I just wanted to play it.

1:12:09.770 --> 1:12:12.030
I mean 'cause I basically
started collecting

1:12:12.030 --> 1:12:13.170
after I start at the store.

1:12:13.170 --> 1:12:17.180
So it was kind of seeing people and how,

1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:18.330
kind of like giddy they would get

1:12:18.330 --> 1:12:20.750
when they would find
something that they've been

1:12:20.750 --> 1:12:22.170
really having a hard time finding

1:12:22.170 --> 1:12:24.390
and I found a really good copy of it.

1:12:24.390 --> 1:12:25.330
So I wanna kind of be part of that.

1:12:25.330 --> 1:12:27.105
So I thought it'd be kind of really neat

1:12:27.105 --> 1:12:30.570
to start acquiring stuff as it came in.

1:12:30.570 --> 1:12:33.290
I was gonna say, do you
have any Pokemon games?

1:12:33.290 --> 1:12:34.580
Besides that one right there?

1:12:34.580 --> 1:12:37.220
For what, like Game
Boy, Game Boy Advanced?

1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:39.890
Game Boy Advanced.
We have a Blue back here.

1:12:39.890 --> 1:12:40.780
Oh!

1:12:40.780 --> 1:12:42.670
The long and short of
it is just seeing people

1:12:42.670 --> 1:12:46.590
and how they reacted to buying something

1:12:46.590 --> 1:12:48.880
that reminded them of their childhood.

1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:50.530
As long as you stay fair

1:12:50.530 --> 1:12:53.280
and you're not a greedy
little son of a bitch,

1:12:53.280 --> 1:12:56.450
then you'll always do well,
no matter where you go.

1:12:56.450 --> 1:12:58.240
When you start thinking about just this

1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:00.390
and not the people, like this guy.

1:13:00.390 --> 1:13:02.930
These people matter, these people matter.

1:13:02.930 --> 1:13:04.420
All lives matter, bro.

1:13:04.420 --> 1:13:05.760
No I'm saying, you know,

1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:07.650
the double edged sword of collecting

1:13:07.650 --> 1:13:09.350
is as long as people feel that,

1:13:09.350 --> 1:13:11.380
you know people will pay that much for it,

1:13:11.380 --> 1:13:12.960
you can always turn the profit on it.

1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:14.680
if you need to, you know.

1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:15.890
Which is fantastic.

1:13:17.260 --> 1:13:18.780
I do it, you know, to buy other stuff.

1:13:18.780 --> 1:13:21.310
So it all balances out.

1:13:21.310 --> 1:13:22.730
We're just as dirty as the rest.

1:13:22.730 --> 1:13:24.410
I'm not gonna sit here and
be a hypocrite about it

1:13:24.410 --> 1:13:25.880
It's true.

1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:27.510
Get in where you fit
in, that's what I say.

1:13:27.510 --> 1:13:30.420
The resellers most of
the people around here

1:13:30.420 --> 1:13:32.480
are passionate collectors and gamers.

1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:34.900
There's hardly anybody
here that's a dirty ol',

1:13:34.900 --> 1:13:36.780
I'm gonna go buy something
and flip it on eBay

1:13:36.780 --> 1:13:38.110
in two seconds, type person.

1:13:38.110 --> 1:13:41.550
Most people here are selling
their doubles and things.

1:13:41.550 --> 1:13:44.370
So the reason why a convention like this

1:13:44.370 --> 1:13:47.800
or other conventions can
exist is because of resellers.

1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:50.190
Because people wanna sell their doubles

1:13:50.190 --> 1:13:51.610
and be able to get more games.

1:13:51.610 --> 1:13:52.510
That's not a bad thing.

1:13:52.510 --> 1:13:53.343
I can't fault them.

1:13:53.343 --> 1:13:55.840
I freaking, I like it all the same

1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:57.360
and I mean, have you ever sold a game?

1:13:57.360 --> 1:13:59.120
Probably, I have too.

1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:01.820
I mean, but the thing is
those are so passionate

1:14:01.820 --> 1:14:03.520
about what we're passionate about.

1:14:07.964 --> 1:14:09.240
This should be interesting.

1:14:10.330 --> 1:14:11.430
Confectious.

1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:14.950
I feel like, especially with this weekend

1:14:16.460 --> 1:14:18.180
to be able to go to this con

1:14:18.180 --> 1:14:21.380
and do what I haven't been
able to do for months,

1:14:21.380 --> 1:14:24.230
this is my almost like
my welcome back party.

1:14:24.230 --> 1:14:26.730
Like hey, I'm back collecting.

1:14:26.730 --> 1:14:30.390
I'm gonna pick up a stack of
NES games for two bucks a piece

1:14:30.390 --> 1:14:32.410
and I'm gonna haggle with people.

1:14:32.410 --> 1:14:34.880
I'm gonna meet people
that I never met before,

1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:36.930
be able to talk with them,
not only just about games,

1:14:36.930 --> 1:14:41.930
maybe about music and culture
and anything you know.

1:14:51.898 --> 1:14:53.709
Oh god, no, not from that side.

1:15:32.013 --> 1:15:35.780
Well we currently have about 2,000,

1:15:35.780 --> 1:15:38.150
3,000 people here walking around.

1:15:39.410 --> 1:15:40.970
130 or so vendors.

1:15:41.970 --> 1:15:43.670
Many, many people, as you can see.

1:15:44.830 --> 1:15:47.594
We've got a live DJ going.

1:15:47.594 --> 1:15:49.960
We've got some panels, live panels

1:15:49.960 --> 1:15:52.160
and some concerts going on currently

1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:53.580
Anyone else, questions, questions.

1:15:53.580 --> 1:15:54.970
It's been an entertaining day.

1:15:54.970 --> 1:15:58.020
We've got no drama yet, which is nice.

1:15:58.020 --> 1:16:01.470
My partners are running
around just as crazy as I am.

1:16:01.470 --> 1:16:03.040
Nothing's breaking.

1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:05.070
Everyone seems to be behaving

1:16:05.070 --> 1:16:06.360
No Stone Cold Stunners.

1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:09.113
So far, so good.

1:16:09.960 --> 1:16:12.360
And I really just wanna
pick up maybe a repro,

1:16:14.070 --> 1:16:16.950
maybe a copy of Castlevania 4, finally.

1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:19.150
I know, hate me.

1:16:39.297 --> 1:16:41.830
It's hard to find them perfect.

1:16:41.830 --> 1:16:43.007
That's close though.

1:16:56.200 --> 1:16:57.810
And it was only released in Japan.

1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:09.840
All right, let's go see,

1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:11.940
let's see if we can find hothead Joe.

1:17:11.940 --> 1:17:12.773
Or crazy Joe.

1:17:34.902 --> 1:17:38.140
I know man, this guy's like
a celebrity or something.

1:17:38.140 --> 1:17:40.629
Look at this.

1:17:40.629 --> 1:17:42.372
It's freakin' packed in here.

1:17:42.372 --> 1:17:44.365
Everyone's having fun.

1:17:44.365 --> 1:17:46.470
10 times bigger than
last year, so it's great.

1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:57.555
I don't have a poker face.

1:17:57.555 --> 1:17:59.416
Who're you kidding?

1:17:59.416 --> 1:18:01.869
Hey, once again I have some guy

1:18:01.869 --> 1:18:04.892
trying to charge 450 for that.

1:18:04.892 --> 1:18:06.936
Down on the way.

1:18:06.936 --> 1:18:09.605
120, maybe.

1:18:09.605 --> 1:18:10.912
That's what, see this is what I mean.

1:18:10.912 --> 1:18:12.300
Like, I hate this.

1:18:12.300 --> 1:18:15.821
What in the hell do you expect,
trying to ask triple value?

1:18:15.821 --> 1:18:17.730
This isn't, I mean it's worse than eBay.

1:18:17.730 --> 1:18:18.563
Holy crap.

1:18:36.699 --> 1:18:39.123
45?

1:18:39.123 --> 1:18:41.295
I'll do 45

1:18:41.295 --> 1:18:42.642
See, I appreciate him working with me.

1:18:42.642 --> 1:18:43.844
That's a fair deal right there.

1:19:00.467 --> 1:19:02.394
I love video games, video games are life.

1:19:11.410 --> 1:19:12.260
Breakdown time.

1:19:15.150 --> 1:19:16.840
It's 10 after six.

1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:18.300
Time to get out of here.

1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:21.870
But overall, incredible, incredible event.

1:19:21.870 --> 1:19:24.020
My partners and I are
super, super pleased.

1:19:25.270 --> 1:19:28.760
They were the last six I needed.

1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:29.710
Outstanding time.

1:19:30.728 --> 1:19:32.110
I don't care if I spent a third

1:19:32.110 --> 1:19:34.620
of what I made in the two days on games.

1:19:34.620 --> 1:19:35.560
Real, real happy.

1:19:42.464 --> 1:19:45.228
Everyone's happy, so
that's what it's all about.

1:19:50.555 --> 1:19:51.972
Found that mug.

1:19:53.900 --> 1:19:58.295
What else?

1:19:58.295 --> 1:20:00.374
3DO.

1:20:00.374 --> 1:20:01.290
Sick.

1:20:01.290 --> 1:20:02.123
Immercenary.

1:20:04.046 --> 1:20:05.396
I just had to have it, man.

1:20:06.380 --> 1:20:09.486
See, it's got some
live-action video in it.

1:20:12.340 --> 1:20:13.390
You get anything, Ben?

1:20:13.390 --> 1:20:15.200
Yeah I got a bunch, it's
all in the car though.

1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:16.662
Okay.

1:20:16.662 --> 1:20:18.760
Nice.

1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:20.629
We shall check it out later.

1:20:20.629 --> 1:20:22.080
Yeah.

1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:23.180
You know, they've got the big conventions

1:20:23.180 --> 1:20:24.800
all over the country, all
over the world really,

1:20:24.800 --> 1:20:26.180
and there's not really much over here.

1:20:26.180 --> 1:20:29.380
But we know, based on social
media and all the local stores,

1:20:29.380 --> 1:20:31.640
like everything is in,
everything is huge and popular.

1:20:31.640 --> 1:20:34.360
So we figured, let's give it
a shot, see what can happen.

1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:36.020
And it's huge and it's getting bigger

1:20:36.020 --> 1:20:37.033
and bigger by the year.

1:20:41.208 --> 1:20:42.676
That was a nice turnout.

1:20:42.676 --> 1:20:43.739
Oh yeah.

1:20:43.739 --> 1:20:44.700
Did you pick up anything good?

1:20:47.138 --> 1:20:48.960
I picked up Pop-eye, Godzilla.

1:20:51.670 --> 1:20:52.503
Wait.

1:20:53.549 --> 1:20:56.097
He had the worst negotiating skills.

1:20:56.097 --> 1:20:58.309
Like, all right man, so
I gotta deal for you.

1:20:58.309 --> 1:20:59.142
Oh yeah, that's right.
Like, I want this one,

1:21:00.003 --> 1:21:01.460
and this one, and this one.

1:21:01.460 --> 1:21:03.240
And can you do 40?

1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:04.310
He's like, it's like five off each.

1:21:04.310 --> 1:21:05.990
He's like, they're 20 each, that'd be 45.

1:21:05.990 --> 1:21:07.690
He's like, aw, fuck.

1:21:07.690 --> 1:21:10.320
I fucked it up, oh well.

1:21:12.531 --> 1:21:14.370
That was good.

1:21:14.370 --> 1:21:16.810
Current status of how
I am feeling right now

1:21:16.810 --> 1:21:20.510
is this was a wonderful,
wonderful fucking weekend.

1:21:20.510 --> 1:21:22.150
I wouldn't change it for the world.

1:21:22.150 --> 1:21:24.933
And I'm definitely coming back next year.

1:21:42.488 --> 1:21:45.650
All right well, my parents.

1:21:48.111 --> 1:21:52.700
The word packrat gets pulled
out a lot from my mother.

1:21:52.700 --> 1:21:55.530
They understand how passionate
I am about video games

1:21:55.530 --> 1:21:56.840
and I mean,

1:21:58.070 --> 1:22:00.080
they like the fact that I collect,

1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:04.340
but they like the fact
that I sell stuff more.

1:22:04.340 --> 1:22:06.450
They like the fact that I
want to open a game store

1:22:06.450 --> 1:22:08.000
and make a career out of what I love

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.275
instead of just using all my money

1:22:10.275 --> 1:22:13.280
to build up a collection that I may never

1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:14.900
do anything with, you know.

1:22:14.900 --> 1:22:17.730
Of course, sometimes
you'll get a family member

1:22:17.730 --> 1:22:20.180
and be like, what the hell
is this, you are sick.

1:22:23.130 --> 1:22:23.963
Boy.

1:22:25.100 --> 1:22:27.230
Some really embrace it, others think,

1:22:27.230 --> 1:22:29.660
you know, why are you
collecting this stuff?

1:22:29.660 --> 1:22:31.410
I have a couple of family members

1:22:31.410 --> 1:22:32.810
that don't really understand it.

1:22:32.810 --> 1:22:35.510
I don't know, they kinda
thought it was funny at first

1:22:35.510 --> 1:22:38.390
they come over and I have
all these old Nintendo tapes

1:22:38.390 --> 1:22:41.990
and they're all on a shelf
and cleaned and dusted off.

1:22:41.990 --> 1:22:45.650
But then, I don't know,
they just kind of got it.

1:22:45.650 --> 1:22:47.540
I mean--
I can't explain it.

1:22:47.540 --> 1:22:49.510
They understood once they saw

1:22:49.510 --> 1:22:51.240
how passionate I was for the hobby.

1:22:51.240 --> 1:22:52.380
Yeah I feel like that's,

1:22:52.380 --> 1:22:54.480
at first it's always the--

1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:56.930
The haters.
Man, look at these nerds.

1:22:56.930 --> 1:22:58.720
What are they doing with these old games?

1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:00.640
Yeah, I collect video games.

1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:02.450
Oh, my cousins have a
couple video games, too.

1:23:02.450 --> 1:23:03.470
You know, they have Xbox.

1:23:03.470 --> 1:23:05.800
I'm like no, but I have
a lot of video games.

1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:07.300
My girlfriend down here
for the first time,

1:23:07.300 --> 1:23:10.980
she was kind of blown away
but she understands now.

1:23:12.650 --> 1:23:14.070
I mean she doesn't think I'm crazy

1:23:14.070 --> 1:23:16.460
even when I explained to her
that I need black box games

1:23:16.460 --> 1:23:17.910
without the hang tabs punched out.

1:23:17.910 --> 1:23:19.910
She understands I'm
very passionate about it

1:23:19.910 --> 1:23:21.290
and she helps any way she can.

1:23:21.290 --> 1:23:22.820
I think for the most
part they're supportive.

1:23:22.820 --> 1:23:24.780
My wife, you know, she's not a huge gamer.

1:23:24.780 --> 1:23:26.370
But I think she appreciates.

1:23:26.370 --> 1:23:28.180
And she's got her own hobbies you know

1:23:28.180 --> 1:23:29.260
and like we'll have hobbies,

1:23:29.260 --> 1:23:31.808
so I respect her hobby, she respects mine.

1:23:31.808 --> 1:23:33.830
And our significant others definitely

1:23:33.830 --> 1:23:34.940
weren't supportive in the beginning.

1:23:34.940 --> 1:23:36.590
No.
I think they've grown

1:23:36.590 --> 1:23:38.140
accustomed to what we do.

1:23:38.140 --> 1:23:39.820
I feel like they didn't have a choice.

1:23:39.820 --> 1:23:40.653
Yeah.

1:23:40.653 --> 1:23:43.550
My girlfriend allowed me, allowed,

1:23:43.550 --> 1:23:44.980
she opted for me to have a game room

1:23:44.980 --> 1:23:48.510
instead of putting them
around the apartment.

1:23:48.510 --> 1:23:51.920
Fortunately my wife is supportive of it.

1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:53.990
She never really gives me a hard time

1:23:53.990 --> 1:23:55.820
There's a lot of worse
things I could be doing

1:23:55.820 --> 1:23:57.180
with my time and money.

1:23:58.960 --> 1:24:02.570
I don't go out drinking
or partying, you know.

1:24:02.570 --> 1:24:05.870
So I guess it's the less of some

1:24:05.870 --> 1:24:07.520
of the evils that are out there.

1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:09.150
My wife initially, I don't think

1:24:09.150 --> 1:24:10.740
she was turned off to the idea.

1:24:10.740 --> 1:24:12.570
I think she was just a
little puzzled by it.

1:24:12.570 --> 1:24:13.930
She didn't understand,

1:24:13.930 --> 1:24:15.430
why does he need all these games,

1:24:15.430 --> 1:24:17.220
he doesn't play all these games.

1:24:17.220 --> 1:24:19.880
What's driving him to
collect all of this stuff.

1:24:20.830 --> 1:24:23.040
But over the years, I think she's seen

1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:25.780
that it's who I am and she knows

1:24:25.780 --> 1:24:27.440
that if that ever went completely away

1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:29.190
that I'd be changing who I am.

1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:31.900
My friends just think I'm nuts.

1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:34.530
I have to justify to my in-laws

1:24:34.530 --> 1:24:36.060
how profitable it is for me,

1:24:36.060 --> 1:24:37.150
even though it's really not.

1:24:37.150 --> 1:24:39.470
I'm breaking even with my double selling,

1:24:39.470 --> 1:24:40.890
and that's just because if I don't,

1:24:40.890 --> 1:24:43.790
they can't justify it
as a rational purchase.

1:24:43.790 --> 1:24:46.580
You know, friends at
work will kind of laugh

1:24:46.580 --> 1:24:48.910
and poke fun at me, but I remind them,

1:24:48.910 --> 1:24:51.000
you know this is the
largest entertainment medium

1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.440
in the world, more than movies.

1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:55.880
So we've all played games

1:24:55.880 --> 1:24:57.660
I just happen to like them a little more.

1:24:57.660 --> 1:24:59.110
When it comes to friends and family

1:24:59.110 --> 1:25:02.410
I think everybody usually
thinks it's really cool

1:25:02.410 --> 1:25:05.080
that you're collecting stuff
when they see things in there.

1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:07.770
Friends especially, because they grew up

1:25:07.770 --> 1:25:09.320
playing the same kind of games.

1:25:10.390 --> 1:25:11.223
Family?

1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:13.070
Yeah, it depends.

1:25:13.070 --> 1:25:15.360
I mean they they understand it.

1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:16.450
They understand the big picture,

1:25:16.450 --> 1:25:19.040
that this is all part
of a show and everything

1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:21.130
and that it's sort of like,

1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:24.380
it's, you know, I'm preserving history.

1:25:24.380 --> 1:25:27.320
My friends, well most of them play games,

1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:29.230
so most of them are very supportive

1:25:29.230 --> 1:25:31.250
of coming to my house and
playing games with me.

1:25:31.250 --> 1:25:33.670
I have a couple friends
who don't play games

1:25:33.670 --> 1:25:34.980
and basically in their opinion

1:25:34.980 --> 1:25:36.870
they're like, oh, she's the nerd.

1:25:36.870 --> 1:25:38.820
A lot of my friends do this hobby with me.

1:25:38.820 --> 1:25:42.170
So they obviously love it, you know.

1:25:42.170 --> 1:25:46.070
They get to travel with me and
it's the thrill of the hunt

1:25:46.070 --> 1:25:47.290
And I'm sure people have said that.

1:25:47.290 --> 1:25:48.993
You're over here making

1:25:48.993 --> 1:25:50.530
gestures or .
No!

1:25:50.530 --> 1:25:52.560
I mean, Wood, for instance, I got--

1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:53.393
I got--
I travel with you--

1:25:53.393 --> 1:25:54.750
Right, he travels with me all the time.

1:25:54.750 --> 1:25:55.730
And that's because of video games

1:25:55.730 --> 1:25:57.400
and it's fucking awesome.
Exactly.

1:25:57.400 --> 1:25:59.280
When it comes to collecting video games

1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:01.410
is it any different, you
know, girls especially,

1:26:01.410 --> 1:26:02.920
why do you collect all those video games?

1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:04.410
Why do you have as many
pair of shoes as you do?

1:26:04.410 --> 1:26:06.270
Why do you have so many purses?

1:26:06.270 --> 1:26:07.590
I'll say it, I don't give a shit.

1:26:07.590 --> 1:26:11.070
I mean this it's no different
than collecting sports cards

1:26:11.070 --> 1:26:13.380
or shoes or purses or anything else.

1:26:13.380 --> 1:26:14.580
Hey you know, you're so old

1:26:14.580 --> 1:26:15.950
and you're still playing video games.

1:26:15.950 --> 1:26:16.980
Yah, yah, yah, yah.

1:26:16.980 --> 1:26:19.730
Honestly I have had nothing but support.

1:26:19.730 --> 1:26:22.230
No one gives me a hard time about it.

1:26:22.230 --> 1:26:25.820
Everyone enjoys that I enjoy video games

1:26:25.820 --> 1:26:26.653
and stuff like that.

1:26:26.653 --> 1:26:28.530
So it's all been very
good, at least for me.

1:26:28.530 --> 1:26:30.170
And everybody's very supportive

1:26:30.170 --> 1:26:32.500
and if you weren't, so be it.

1:26:33.510 --> 1:26:34.700
I mean it depends on my friends.

1:26:34.700 --> 1:26:36.530
A lot of my friends are dicks.

1:26:36.530 --> 1:26:38.910
Like, I mean me and my
friends joke around a lot.

1:26:38.910 --> 1:26:41.800
So like my collector friends,
they think it's awesome.

1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:43.060
Like some people will be come in here

1:26:43.060 --> 1:26:44.430
and just be like holy shit

1:26:44.430 --> 1:26:46.710
and just start looking at everything

1:26:46.710 --> 1:26:48.820
'cause they get to play
all the stuff, too,

1:26:48.820 --> 1:26:50.570
without having to buy it.

1:26:50.570 --> 1:26:52.900
Because we can all choose our own hobbies

1:26:52.900 --> 1:26:55.800
and as long as you're
not harming someone else

1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:58.810
doing your hobby, then cool.

1:27:06.420 --> 1:27:07.380
If video games weren't around,

1:27:07.380 --> 1:27:09.560
what would Reggie be doing?

1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:12.470
If I wasn't collecting I would probably,

1:27:12.470 --> 1:27:13.303
ooh, that's a tough one.

1:27:13.303 --> 1:27:15.670
'Cause I would have been
collecting something.

1:27:15.670 --> 1:27:17.310
Ooh, that's a tough one.

1:27:17.310 --> 1:27:18.780
Wow!

1:27:18.780 --> 1:27:20.750
What would my hobby be?

1:27:20.750 --> 1:27:23.840
People need a hobby and
it's very hard for me

1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:26.480
to compare this hobby
to anything else, right.

1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:28.140
It's actually a very tricky question.

1:27:28.140 --> 1:27:29.730
I honestly don't really know what I'd do.

1:27:29.730 --> 1:27:31.680
This is really my number one hobby,

1:27:32.830 --> 1:27:34.560
besides playing video games.

1:27:35.830 --> 1:27:39.840
I like writing a lot but I
like writing about video games.

1:27:39.840 --> 1:27:41.810
Basically before I collected,
I just worked like a maniac.

1:27:41.810 --> 1:27:44.070
I really didn't have a hobby.

1:27:44.070 --> 1:27:45.620
Worked 80 hours a week.

1:27:45.620 --> 1:27:48.020
If I wasn't collecting, I
be working a nine-to-five.

1:27:48.920 --> 1:27:49.930
Miserable.

1:27:49.930 --> 1:27:51.450
If I wasn't collecting video games

1:27:51.450 --> 1:27:53.390
it'd probably be more VHS tapes

1:27:53.390 --> 1:27:57.170
or beta tapes, 16 millimeter films

1:27:57.170 --> 1:28:00.240
As a hobby I'd probably be
collecting horror movies.

1:28:01.259 --> 1:28:02.092
Yeah.

1:28:02.092 --> 1:28:04.800
Watching scary movies and
critiquing scary movies.

1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:07.150
I would probably be at culinary school.

1:28:07.150 --> 1:28:09.380
I'd probably be outside more.

1:28:09.380 --> 1:28:11.970
I'd probably get back
into collecting militaria

1:28:11.970 --> 1:28:14.420
Probably would be reading a lot more.

1:28:14.420 --> 1:28:15.570
Probably going crazy.

1:28:15.570 --> 1:28:18.070
Traveling and I thank my wife for that.

1:28:18.070 --> 1:28:19.870
Like I hated traveling before I met her

1:28:19.870 --> 1:28:22.150
and now it's sounding more appealing.

1:28:22.150 --> 1:28:22.983
Filmmaking.

1:28:22.983 --> 1:28:26.000
I mean if I'm not doing
something gaming related

1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.830
I'm usually out shootin'.

1:28:27.830 --> 1:28:30.940
The answer is right next
to me and right behind me.

1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:36.330
When I wasn't playing
games, I was playing music.

1:28:36.330 --> 1:28:38.590
Well, I teach game history and design.

1:28:39.690 --> 1:28:42.520
I research game literacy, appreciation,

1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:44.550
trans-mediation involving games,

1:28:44.550 --> 1:28:46.280
so if I wasn't collecting
or playing games,

1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:49.030
I'd be doing myself and my
students quite a disservice.

1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:52.070
I'd also probably be playing more hockey.

1:28:52.909 --> 1:28:54.660
If I wasn't collecting,
I'd probably be able

1:28:54.660 --> 1:28:56.040
to have a lot more fun in my life.

1:28:56.040 --> 1:28:59.230
And not have to worry
about acquiring old relics

1:28:59.230 --> 1:29:01.900
of a physical media that's dead.

1:29:01.900 --> 1:29:03.260
I don't know, I think
I would sit in a room

1:29:03.260 --> 1:29:05.320
in a chair and be bored.

1:29:05.320 --> 1:29:06.920
That's what I think I'd be doing.

1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:12.420
That's so pathetic but
I think it's honest.

1:29:12.420 --> 1:29:13.970
Probably in a cavern,

1:29:13.970 --> 1:29:17.790
just on a kayak out on a lake.

1:29:17.790 --> 1:29:19.100
Just takin' it easy.

1:29:19.100 --> 1:29:20.390
If I wasn't collecting video games,

1:29:20.390 --> 1:29:23.170
more than likely I'd have
a garden outside, maybe,

1:29:23.170 --> 1:29:26.510
grow some tomatoes,
eggplants, watermelons.

1:29:26.510 --> 1:29:29.600
I like watermelons, so I'd try
to have a watermelon patch.

1:29:30.470 --> 1:29:34.350
I would probably be spending
a lot more time at bars

1:29:34.350 --> 1:29:36.450
and partying with my
friends in my free time.

1:29:36.450 --> 1:29:37.950
Sadly, but yeah, that's true.

1:29:39.320 --> 1:29:41.240
I think collecting's
kept me out of trouble

1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:43.260
and kind of in a safe environment.

1:29:45.030 --> 1:29:49.900
Honestly, I probably would be

1:29:49.900 --> 1:29:51.340
a drug addict.

1:29:51.340 --> 1:29:53.150
I sold drugs for 20 years.

1:29:53.150 --> 1:29:54.850
It's what I did, it's what I loved.

1:29:54.850 --> 1:29:56.860
That's, you know, my
passion for selling drugs

1:29:56.860 --> 1:30:00.060
was just as deep as my
passion for video games now.

1:30:00.060 --> 1:30:02.590
I was definitely hanging
out with the wrong crowd.

1:30:02.590 --> 1:30:04.900
I mean, I remember finding myself

1:30:04.900 --> 1:30:08.370
at a drug dealers trailer
in the middle of nowhere

1:30:08.370 --> 1:30:12.390
and he had, you know
this was back in 2002,

1:30:12.390 --> 1:30:16.050
so he had a Escalade with
23 inch spinners and stuff.

1:30:16.050 --> 1:30:18.890
And inside of this trailer
was like mink carpet

1:30:18.890 --> 1:30:22.660
and huge flat-screen TVs and
leather couches and stuff.

1:30:22.660 --> 1:30:24.580
And I was like what am I doing here?

1:30:24.580 --> 1:30:26.060
Like, this isn't me.

1:30:27.563 --> 1:30:29.980
I would be dead, prison, or selling drugs

1:30:29.980 --> 1:30:31.350
and on my way to both.

1:30:31.350 --> 1:30:34.480
And that's an honest 100% answer.

1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:36.350
And so yeah, I mean a lot of my friends

1:30:36.350 --> 1:30:38.663
from that time period are either

1:30:38.663 --> 1:30:41.770
in a very bad place, dead, or in jail.

1:30:41.770 --> 1:30:45.250
So more than likely, I probably would have

1:30:45.250 --> 1:30:46.730
just been one of those three.

1:30:46.730 --> 1:30:50.120
At 36 years old, have been
to prison, have done that.

1:30:50.120 --> 1:30:52.130
Don't want to do it ever again.

1:30:52.130 --> 1:30:56.220
This is by far the best decision I've made

1:30:56.220 --> 1:30:58.540
in my 36 years of existence.

1:30:58.540 --> 1:31:01.800
No, you know what, I don't know.

1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:03.670
My job now is because of gaming.

1:31:04.630 --> 1:31:06.700
I'd probably be miserable

1:31:06.700 --> 1:31:08.870
in my professional career, honestly.

1:31:08.870 --> 1:31:09.980
You're not wrong.

1:31:09.980 --> 1:31:10.813
I'm not, right?

1:31:10.813 --> 1:31:14.770
I mean, I've been able to take gaming

1:31:14.770 --> 1:31:18.030
and turn it into a way to pay my bills

1:31:18.030 --> 1:31:19.780
and have fun doing it and put smiles

1:31:19.780 --> 1:31:21.290
on people's faces doing it.

1:31:21.290 --> 1:31:22.700
I run my own video game convention,

1:31:22.700 --> 1:31:24.550
that is my main source of income,

1:31:24.550 --> 1:31:25.850
that's how I pay my bills.

1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:30.710
So I'd be stuck, because before that

1:31:30.710 --> 1:31:33.840
I was doing jobs I hated
and didn't want to do,

1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:37.090
but when you're an adult,
you know, you wanna eat,

1:31:37.090 --> 1:31:38.280
you do shit you don't want to do.

1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:39.730
It's just the way it happens.

1:31:40.770 --> 1:31:43.710
So yeah, I'd be miserable if
it weren't for gaming, I guess.

1:31:50.610 --> 1:31:52.710
I can't even believe
it is where it is now,

1:31:52.710 --> 1:31:55.350
because it's gone from kind
of like, oh, you're a nerd

1:31:55.350 --> 1:31:57.770
to like, wow dude, you
got a lot of cool stuff.

1:31:58.710 --> 1:31:59.840
But I definitely don't see it

1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:01.820
like turning the other
direction any time soon.

1:32:01.820 --> 1:32:04.850
So yeah, that's a good question, man.

1:32:04.850 --> 1:32:06.430
I really don't have a
good answer for that.

1:32:06.430 --> 1:32:07.860
The hobby's just gonna keep growing.

1:32:07.860 --> 1:32:09.390
I don't think it's ever gonna stop.

1:32:09.390 --> 1:32:10.600
People have been saying that

1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:11.840
this is a dying hobby--
Yeah, been saying that

1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:13.410
for 10, 15 years.

1:32:13.410 --> 1:32:16.550
And that the value of
these games is gonna pop,

1:32:16.550 --> 1:32:18.990
like this bubble, this
imaginary bubble date

1:32:18.990 --> 1:32:20.950
they talk about is gonna pop

1:32:20.950 --> 1:32:22.740
like comic books and baseball cards,

1:32:22.740 --> 1:32:24.900
but the thing is comic
books and baseball cards

1:32:24.900 --> 1:32:26.180
didn't provide an entertainment--

1:32:26.180 --> 1:32:28.070
Exactly, you can only
do so much with them.

1:32:28.070 --> 1:32:31.770
I mean I've never seen
a kid pick up a Nintendo

1:32:31.770 --> 1:32:34.380
and not like become
intrigued by it, at least.

1:32:34.380 --> 1:32:37.080
I'm not sure if collecting ever stops.

1:32:37.080 --> 1:32:38.710
I think it goes through ebbs and flows.

1:32:38.710 --> 1:32:40.420
So I don't think the
the scene will ever die,

1:32:40.420 --> 1:32:42.950
I think the definition will just change.

1:32:42.950 --> 1:32:46.750
Retro games for us might be Atari and NES.

1:32:46.750 --> 1:32:49.500
For our kids they might
be the Nintendo DS.

1:32:49.500 --> 1:32:51.250
So there's always gonna be a retro scene.

1:32:51.250 --> 1:32:53.030
It's just gonna keep shifting.

1:32:53.030 --> 1:32:54.270
Like I said, it's already a trend now,

1:32:54.270 --> 1:32:55.103
it's gonna become big.

1:32:55.103 --> 1:33:00.030
I mean, I don't see retro
collecting video games

1:33:00.030 --> 1:33:01.220
is always gonna be around

1:33:01.220 --> 1:33:02.530
and it's always gonna be people

1:33:02.530 --> 1:33:03.970
getting into it, the younger generation,

1:33:03.970 --> 1:33:05.970
because they're impressed by us.

1:33:05.970 --> 1:33:07.080
We introduced them the games.

1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:10.250
They like it, they want to
get into it, it's a fun hobby.

1:33:10.250 --> 1:33:12.000
Almost all markets are subject

1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:13.900
to some sort of sinusoidal pattern.

1:33:13.900 --> 1:33:17.010
Prices could careen in
the wake of something,

1:33:17.010 --> 1:33:19.510
or demand could shift
to a different console

1:33:19.510 --> 1:33:22.390
as that kind of enters its retro window.

1:33:22.390 --> 1:33:24.540
I don't see the entire sphere collapsing,

1:33:24.540 --> 1:33:25.740
if that's what you mean.

1:33:27.348 --> 1:33:29.620
Games are here to stay, at least until

1:33:29.620 --> 1:33:31.840
a wholly different medium
tries to challenge them.

1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:33.540
Video games will be around forever.

1:33:33.540 --> 1:33:35.870
Whether they'll be physical or digital?

1:33:35.870 --> 1:33:37.580
I truly do not know.

1:33:37.580 --> 1:33:40.200
The worst case, I feel like
everything's gonna go digital.

1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:41.910
The way the market's going,

1:33:41.910 --> 1:33:44.520
there's gonna be just digital gaming.

1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:45.870
So I don't see it crashing.

1:33:46.770 --> 1:33:51.560
There's gonna be gaming
obviously, iOS, on your PC, Steam.

1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:53.440
All that stuff is gonna be always around

1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:56.960
because there's no real
risk to the big companies.

1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:59.730
And I think I'll always be
excited about new video games

1:33:59.730 --> 1:34:02.150
as long as they have physical media

1:34:02.150 --> 1:34:05.110
because once it goes to
the download-only thing

1:34:05.110 --> 1:34:06.860
it's just, I don't know, for some reason,

1:34:06.860 --> 1:34:09.330
for me anyway, it's just not as exciting.

1:34:09.330 --> 1:34:11.590
I mean, for you it may be exciting,

1:34:11.590 --> 1:34:15.880
but for me, it doesn't really
tickle my fancy too much.

1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:17.540
Like to me, that could just be me,

1:34:17.540 --> 1:34:19.710
being old man Wittenhagen over here,

1:34:19.710 --> 1:34:22.990
saying I don't want to move
on to these newfangled games.

1:34:22.990 --> 1:34:26.430
But I really think that
there is something to it.

1:34:26.430 --> 1:34:28.450
I've heard about an upcoming
crash over and over again

1:34:28.450 --> 1:34:30.030
and there have been several.

1:34:30.030 --> 1:34:31.100
I hear a lot of people say, you know,

1:34:31.100 --> 1:34:33.540
the industry's so big
it can't fall on itself.

1:34:33.540 --> 1:34:35.600
I don't know if I believe that.

1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:37.550
But I mean, at this point it's not a fad

1:34:37.550 --> 1:34:39.840
I mean it's in almost all the homes.

1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:42.280
I feel like it is becoming more,

1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:44.890
I mean it's definitely pop culture.

1:34:44.890 --> 1:34:46.140
I don't think we're gonna have a point

1:34:46.140 --> 1:34:48.760
where it's just like people
are gonna stop playing games

1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:49.810
I think there's always
gonna be, it's not like

1:34:49.810 --> 1:34:50.643
you're gonna wake up one day,

1:34:50.643 --> 1:34:52.810
like I don't like video games anymore.

1:34:52.810 --> 1:34:54.660
You know what I mean, like I
just don't see that happening

1:34:54.660 --> 1:34:55.660
or even gradually over time.

1:34:55.660 --> 1:34:59.330
I think people will always
be fond of video games.

1:34:59.330 --> 1:35:01.920
I mean, you mentioned yourself,
games will go more digital.

1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:05.980
I think that will affect some
purchasing habits later on

1:35:05.980 --> 1:35:07.470
but we'll see.

1:35:07.470 --> 1:35:09.160
Do I think there's a crash coming?

1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:11.190
I do think there's a crash coming.

1:35:11.190 --> 1:35:13.220
And the people who are in it for the money

1:35:13.220 --> 1:35:15.050
are in for a rude awakening.

1:35:15.050 --> 1:35:17.740
The people who do it because they love it,

1:35:17.740 --> 1:35:19.000
shouldn't care either way.

1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:20.480
But it's happening.

1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:24.090
And so you go from what
should have been a market

1:35:24.090 --> 1:35:25.570
that would have been like a bell curve

1:35:25.570 --> 1:35:29.150
and eventually dropped
off as we lose interest,

1:35:29.150 --> 1:35:30.960
like now you got the upwards

1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:32.650
but now it's gonna be stable.

1:35:32.650 --> 1:35:35.200
I mean if the kids keep collecting,

1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:36.430
like it wouldn't go down

1:35:36.430 --> 1:35:38.930
'cause you've got a new
crop, and if it continues,

1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:42.970
like if we get into some
Ready Player One shit,

1:35:42.970 --> 1:35:46.330
in like gaming and life,

1:35:47.460 --> 1:35:48.800
it's no longer pop culture.

1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:51.540
Like now the two are
like weirdly intertwined,

1:35:52.540 --> 1:35:53.970
then I don't see it going away,

1:35:53.970 --> 1:35:58.020
because now this is the
beginning of the history

1:35:58.020 --> 1:36:00.303
of the future, if that makes sense.

1:36:22.170 --> 1:36:23.120
Why do I collect?

1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:28.860
See, I can't answer that for anybody else.

1:36:28.860 --> 1:36:30.020
Why do we collect?

1:36:30.020 --> 1:36:31.630
There's something wrong and twisted

1:36:31.630 --> 1:36:32.880
in the back of our heads.

1:36:34.790 --> 1:36:37.450
Well obviously, some of us
are just wired that way.

1:36:37.450 --> 1:36:41.390
Probably just some mental things going on

1:36:41.390 --> 1:36:43.140
that certain types of people

1:36:43.140 --> 1:36:44.820
make them want to collect things

1:36:44.820 --> 1:36:47.690
and you know gotta catch 'em all.

1:36:47.690 --> 1:36:50.720
It's like some kind of
fascination either way.

1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:51.800
It's like an addiction.

1:36:51.800 --> 1:36:54.020
Once you start collecting video games

1:36:54.020 --> 1:36:56.960
you might go on hiatuses but deep down

1:36:56.960 --> 1:36:57.870
you're gonna have the passion.

1:36:57.870 --> 1:36:59.600
It's like a drug, isn't it?

1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:01.330
Yeah, it's like Mary Jane.
It's an addiction.

1:37:01.330 --> 1:37:03.290
You gotta have Mary Jane.

1:37:03.290 --> 1:37:04.670
It's a gateway drug.

1:37:04.670 --> 1:37:06.400
It's kind of like when you buy a Mario 2,

1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:08.310
it's a gateway, you know
like a Mario time machine

1:37:08.310 --> 1:37:11.200
and then Stadium Events and it
just keeps going up the line.

1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:13.020
I think it's more of an addiction.

1:37:13.020 --> 1:37:16.150
I don't see how you can amass

1:37:16.150 --> 1:37:18.740
a certain quantity of games

1:37:18.740 --> 1:37:20.900
and then just be like, okay I'm done.

1:37:20.900 --> 1:37:22.730
Like that's part of you,

1:37:22.730 --> 1:37:25.450
whether you realize it or not

1:37:25.450 --> 1:37:27.880
video games takes over
a part of your life.

1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:30.320
It is kind of addicting,
I mean I guess I do

1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:32.550
have somewhat of an addictive personality.

1:37:32.550 --> 1:37:35.280
Once you're in it, once you have that bug,

1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:36.680
it's pretty addicting.

1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:39.940
Collecting is just like
any other addiction,

1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:42.320
so you have to keep that in mind.

1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:44.900
Collecting can be just
like a drug addiction.

1:37:46.590 --> 1:37:48.230
You name it, it could
be just as dangerous.

1:37:48.230 --> 1:37:51.220
People get into this hobby and
sometimes they can't get out.

1:37:51.220 --> 1:37:52.510
And the only way out is by selling

1:37:52.510 --> 1:37:55.610
their entire collection at a huge loss.

1:37:55.610 --> 1:37:57.080
And unfortunately the other way out

1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:59.000
is not one I really want to talk about

1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.050
because it's happened several times.

1:38:01.050 --> 1:38:03.500
So it's a real thing that happens

1:38:03.500 --> 1:38:05.260
and I've seen both sides of this.

1:38:05.260 --> 1:38:08.800
Unfortunately, if you
don't call it what it is,

1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:10.780
collecting is a form of addiction.

1:38:10.780 --> 1:38:12.560
If you do not call it for what it is,

1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:13.780
you can't control it.

1:38:13.780 --> 1:38:16.660
I dream video games,
I wake up video games.

1:38:16.660 --> 1:38:19.420
You know a lot of people
use it as an escape.

1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:20.790
I've been pretty blessed in my life.

1:38:20.790 --> 1:38:22.560
I mean everybody has a story to tell.

1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:23.790
I've had my ups and downs

1:38:23.790 --> 1:38:26.380
but I don't think I ever
used it as an escape.

1:38:26.380 --> 1:38:29.480
Video games is probably
the most dominant thing

1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:33.130
in my life besides my day job.

1:38:33.130 --> 1:38:35.120
Like it's not just something

1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:37.420
I can just flip a switch and turn off

1:38:37.420 --> 1:38:39.665
and I don't think I would want

1:38:39.665 --> 1:38:42.190
to flip a switch and turn it off.

1:38:42.190 --> 1:38:44.090
In a way, it's kind of
reliving my childhood,

1:38:44.090 --> 1:38:47.270
it's going back to that
stage of peace and kindness

1:38:47.270 --> 1:38:49.000
when you had no worries in the world.

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:50.330
I feel like when I do collect video games

1:38:50.330 --> 1:38:53.150
and I just look at my
man cave or game room,

1:38:53.150 --> 1:38:54.300
whatever we call it nowadays,

1:38:54.300 --> 1:38:56.820
you know, it just gives me
a peace of mind and a joy

1:38:56.820 --> 1:38:58.360
that you know everything
is gonna be alright

1:38:58.360 --> 1:38:59.910
and there's better stuff.

1:38:59.910 --> 1:39:01.170
So that's the reason why I collect,

1:39:01.170 --> 1:39:03.260
just to go back to that memory.

1:39:03.260 --> 1:39:06.870
Yeah it, in my opinion, it all goes back

1:39:06.870 --> 1:39:08.470
to good memories, fond memories,

1:39:09.330 --> 1:39:12.260
memories of picking the
game up, playing the game,

1:39:12.260 --> 1:39:14.290
memories of playing with friends

1:39:14.290 --> 1:39:16.710
who are no longer around or around you.

1:39:17.950 --> 1:39:20.180
Yeah, I hate to keep throwing
the word nostalgia around

1:39:20.180 --> 1:39:22.500
but that's what it all goes back to.

1:39:22.500 --> 1:39:24.310
It's happy childhood memories.

1:39:24.310 --> 1:39:26.410
It's good times with friends.

1:39:27.740 --> 1:39:31.700
That, I think, you can't
really battle nostalgia.

1:39:31.700 --> 1:39:34.280
It brings you back to an idyllic time

1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:36.720
when the best part of your day

1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:38.620
was sitting down and playing a game

1:39:38.620 --> 1:39:40.780
and beating a level or beating a boss

1:39:40.780 --> 1:39:42.570
and having fun with your friends.

1:39:42.570 --> 1:39:44.470
And no matter what happens in life,

1:39:44.470 --> 1:39:46.420
you'll always have that magic moment.

1:39:46.420 --> 1:39:48.670
And video games, movies, comic books,

1:39:48.670 --> 1:39:50.140
all that, bring you back

1:39:50.140 --> 1:39:52.380
to that one perfect Saturday afternoon.

1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:54.950
And that's why they'll never go away.

1:39:54.950 --> 1:39:59.950
I mean it's in the heart,
you know, it just takes you,

1:40:00.410 --> 1:40:02.570
but no matter what you're
going through in life,

1:40:02.570 --> 1:40:05.980
a hard time or something else,

1:40:05.980 --> 1:40:07.350
you'll always play a video game

1:40:07.350 --> 1:40:09.790
and it'll take you back to a good time.

1:40:09.790 --> 1:40:12.840
It opened up a new world for me.

1:40:14.220 --> 1:40:15.490
I can't, I love it.

1:40:15.490 --> 1:40:17.080
You know, just the feel.

1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:19.010
Tell me every time you pick up that cart

1:40:19.010 --> 1:40:20.360
and you gotta ,

1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:22.730
you're not just like
and it takes you back,

1:40:22.730 --> 1:40:25.320
and it's like a time warp in your mind.

1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:28.340
That split instant, the
minute you blow in that game

1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:29.880
to the minute you find that game

1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:31.657
that you played when
you were a little kid.

1:40:31.657 --> 1:40:34.630
You can literally picture
your mom handing it to you

1:40:34.630 --> 1:40:36.270
and you may be crying at Christmas.

1:40:36.270 --> 1:40:37.670
Or you know, the bad days

1:40:37.670 --> 1:40:39.500
that you couldn't have
a game and you cried,

1:40:39.500 --> 1:40:41.300
you wanted that game so bad.

1:40:41.300 --> 1:40:43.740
You can remember throwing
yourself down on the floor

1:40:43.740 --> 1:40:46.760
in Kmart and Ames and Hills
and, you know what I mean?

1:40:46.760 --> 1:40:50.530
And now you get to have that
game as a grown-ass man.

1:40:50.530 --> 1:40:52.680
You know, there's not a
better feeling like that,

1:40:52.680 --> 1:40:54.470
to accomplish something you couldn't have

1:40:54.470 --> 1:40:57.600
when you were little, I
don't know, to me it's just,

1:40:57.600 --> 1:40:59.150
it's hard to explain, man.

1:40:59.150 --> 1:41:00.850
When people get brought back to that place

1:41:00.850 --> 1:41:03.510
it's almost like, it's
like a magical place.

1:41:03.510 --> 1:41:04.910
It takes you somewhere safe.

1:41:06.066 --> 1:41:10.040
It makes you feel comfortable
and people want nostalgia.

1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:11.810
They want their memories.

1:41:11.810 --> 1:41:12.940
They want to hold on to it.

1:41:12.940 --> 1:41:14.990
That's why people, I think,
hold on to their games

1:41:14.990 --> 1:41:17.010
is 'cause they're holding
on to their memories.

1:41:17.970 --> 1:41:19.180
That's what I do.

1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:22.900
It's definitely such an
important part of our culture.

1:41:22.900 --> 1:41:26.500
I think it's our generation,
Gen X, it's our antiques.

1:41:27.550 --> 1:41:29.150
It's literally like collecting art

1:41:29.150 --> 1:41:31.040
because I mean, it's the collectors

1:41:31.040 --> 1:41:32.720
that are kind of bringing them back out

1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:34.200
and displaying them like this.

1:41:34.200 --> 1:41:36.960
And showing that these are
a part of gaming roots.

1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:39.520
Like no matter what games come out,

1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:41.710
these were the first ones.

1:41:41.710 --> 1:41:44.760
And they probably wouldn't
exist if it weren't for these.

1:41:44.760 --> 1:41:48.010
I think that's what it is,
like you stay young at heart

1:41:48.010 --> 1:41:52.070
and that's why you keep collecting.

1:41:52.070 --> 1:41:55.030
It's our generations thing
that we can be champions in

1:41:55.030 --> 1:41:57.420
and we can be up with
some of the classics.

1:41:59.210 --> 1:42:00.760
That's hard to trade for anything.

1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:02.390
No, but why do we collect?

1:42:03.620 --> 1:42:06.950
You know I've been asking myself
that question for decades.

1:42:06.950 --> 1:42:09.490
If this is where the first 50
years of video games got us,

1:42:09.490 --> 1:42:11.730
I'm really excited to see the next 50.

1:42:11.730 --> 1:42:13.950
Been one hell of a ride,
and it ain't done yet.

1:42:13.950 --> 1:42:15.844

hey, if you're gonna
be filmed for a movie,

I say video games kept me out of trouble

1:43:53.820 --> 1:43:56.450
'cause I could have been somewhere

1:43:56.450 --> 1:43:59.710

No, don't put the camera back
here all of a sudden now!

1:44:21.030 --> 1:44:22.665

that kind of went under
the table at the time

1:44:45.830 --> 1:44:47.600

it's like a retro archaeological find.

It's a discovery.

1:44:57.390 --> 1:44:59.470

yeah, so it's the best
feeling in the world for me.
