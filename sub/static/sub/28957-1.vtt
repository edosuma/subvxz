00:04.280 --> 00:05.581
MATT:
The weapons are
flowing south.

00:05.681 --> 00:06.949
The Contras are pushing back.

00:07.049 --> 00:07.950
That's how you're funding this?

00:08.050 --> 00:09.752
TEDDY:
If we win this war,

00:09.852 --> 00:12.488
we can change
the course of history.

00:12.588 --> 00:15.925
JOHNSON YOUNG:
They charged you with a 187 PC.

00:16.025 --> 00:17.393
Murder one.

00:17.493 --> 00:18.461
(grunts)

00:18.561 --> 00:19.995
Alton.

00:20.096 --> 00:22.998
You wait till I'm in here
to be a fucking dad?

00:23.099 --> 00:25.067
-Stop. Stop!
-Don't you fucking
come back here!

00:25.168 --> 00:28.003
-CISSY: Wait!
-Stay the fuck away from me!

00:28.104 --> 00:29.772
(crying):
Franklin. Don't hurt him.

00:29.872 --> 00:31.174
LOUIE:
This is about getting my nephew

00:31.274 --> 00:32.342
out of that prison.

00:32.442 --> 00:36.078
So, if there is anything
that you can do, do it.

00:36.179 --> 00:39.815
FRANKLIN:
I don't think
our Mr. Reed Thompson's

00:39.915 --> 00:41.351
just some drug dealer.

00:41.451 --> 00:43.853
I think he works
for the government.

00:43.953 --> 00:47.923
And now, well,
I think we work for him.

00:48.023 --> 00:49.659
DEA! Hands up!

00:49.759 --> 00:51.661
-(siren whoops)
-Hands up, hands up.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.163
We've been instructed
to shut down

00:53.263 --> 00:57.600
every facet of this operation
and walk away.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.336
Cut Lucia and Gustavo loose.

01:00.436 --> 01:02.805
LORENA:
What agency would want
to shut down a DEA operation?

01:02.905 --> 01:04.774
TEDDY:
Give me just long enough

01:04.874 --> 01:07.643
for us to give
the Nicaraguan people

01:07.743 --> 01:09.011
their democracy back,
and I promise you

01:09.111 --> 01:10.446
that I will hand over

01:10.546 --> 01:12.047
every distributor,
every dealer

01:12.148 --> 01:13.516
and every supplier
that we work with

01:13.616 --> 01:14.817
-along the way.
-FRANKLIN: If you falling

01:14.917 --> 01:16.452
for Claudia,
that's bad for business.

01:16.552 --> 01:18.154
That's a problem.

01:18.254 --> 01:19.222
(yelling, groaning)

01:21.023 --> 01:22.458
I didn't invent this rock.

01:22.558 --> 01:23.659
But I'm-a blow it up.

01:23.759 --> 01:25.395
(knocking on door)

01:25.495 --> 01:26.662
Mr. Wright.

01:26.762 --> 01:28.564
-Officer Wright.
-How can I help you, Officer?

01:28.664 --> 01:31.701
Stay the fuck away
from me and mine.

01:31.801 --> 01:33.403
That all?

01:49.219 --> 01:51.221
(chimes jingling,
wind whooshing)

01:59.429 --> 02:01.364
*

02:01.464 --> 02:04.734
(indistinct chatter)

02:11.541 --> 02:16.246
* Trash men didn't
get my trash today *

02:16.346 --> 02:20.750
* Oh, why?
Because they want more pay *

02:20.850 --> 02:24.554
(chatter continues,
whooping, laughter)

02:24.654 --> 02:29.725
* Buses on strike,
want a raise in fare *

02:29.825 --> 02:31.894
-(indistinct chatter)
-* So they can help *

02:31.994 --> 02:35.398
* Pollute the air *

02:38.268 --> 02:39.802
* But that's what makes *

02:39.902 --> 02:42.037
* The world go round *

02:42.137 --> 02:43.773
* The up and downs *

02:43.873 --> 02:46.809
* A carousel *

02:48.644 --> 02:51.747
* Changing people's
heads around *

02:51.847 --> 02:53.283
* Go underground, young man... *

02:53.383 --> 02:54.984
It's all there.

02:55.084 --> 02:56.819
Come on, now.
You know how this works.

02:56.919 --> 02:58.321
BRIANNA:
Come on, just give me the rock.

02:58.421 --> 03:00.222
-DEALER: Bitch, this only nine.
-Nuh-uh, that's ten.

03:00.323 --> 03:02.124
-You saying I can't count?
-Just count it again.

03:02.224 --> 03:04.627
-Hey, get out of here.
-Give me the rock,
and I'll leave.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.629
-Hey.
-BRIANNA: Just come on.

03:06.729 --> 03:08.464
-It's just one,
one fucking dollar.
-Hey!

03:08.564 --> 03:10.600
-Hey, walk away.
-(Brianna gasping)

03:10.700 --> 03:12.602
-Fuck this. You out of
your goddamn mind?
-(engine revs)

03:12.702 --> 03:15.438
-Hey!
-(Brianna screaming)

03:16.739 --> 03:18.240
Whoa!

03:18.341 --> 03:20.310
(panting)

03:20.410 --> 03:21.611
(tires squealing)

03:21.711 --> 03:23.112
(gasping, whimpering)

03:23.212 --> 03:24.447
(grunts)

03:24.547 --> 03:26.582
(onlookers murmuring)

03:30.252 --> 03:33.789
* But that's what makes
the world go round *

03:33.889 --> 03:38.994
* The up and downs, a carousel *

03:41.030 --> 03:44.634
* Changing people's
heads around *

03:44.734 --> 03:49.472
* Go underground, young man *

03:49.572 --> 03:51.807
(chimes jingling,
wind whooshing)

03:51.907 --> 03:56.045
* People make the world go... *

04:05.187 --> 04:07.457
(dog barking in distance)

04:10.826 --> 04:12.695
(indistinct chatter in distance)

04:14.129 --> 04:17.700
12 units,
all two-bedroom, one-bath,

04:17.800 --> 04:19.569
nine of them currently occupied.

04:19.669 --> 04:22.638
All with water damage
and shoddy wiring.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.141
Any idea
when the heat last worked?

04:27.810 --> 04:29.812
I am pretty sure it does.
(chuckles)

04:29.912 --> 04:32.682
And I'm sure the inspections
will reveal good bones.

04:32.782 --> 04:35.985
And the Summer Games has
this whole area on the rise.

04:36.085 --> 04:39.355
We have a lender we like if you
decide you want to move forward.

04:39.455 --> 04:41.424
FRANKLIN:
We make an offer, it'll be cash.

04:44.760 --> 04:48.764
I'd like a minute with
my partner, if you don't mind.

04:48.864 --> 04:51.367
I'll be right outside
if you need anything at all.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.739
(door opens, closes)

04:56.839 --> 04:59.909
Man sell any harder,
he's gonna pull a muscle.

05:01.911 --> 05:04.547
You know, price per square foot
still seems high.

05:04.647 --> 05:06.382
Needs a lot more work
than we thought,

05:06.482 --> 05:08.418
and not just new carpet
and paint.

05:08.518 --> 05:11.521
Mm. But long term?

05:14.790 --> 05:16.759
This is the place.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.528
JEROME:
Hey, Louie!

05:18.628 --> 05:20.396
Come on, now!

05:20.496 --> 05:22.197
Shit.

05:22.297 --> 05:24.800
(quietly): Getting dressed
all the goddamn time.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.369
Yeah, boy, you look good.

05:27.470 --> 05:29.371
Hey, come on.

05:29.472 --> 05:30.940
-LOUIE: Hmm?
-You ready?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.708
Yeah. I'm waiting on you.

05:32.808 --> 05:33.976
What you mean, waiting on me?
You made me late

05:34.076 --> 05:36.045
-to my own goddamn opening.
-Hey.

05:36.145 --> 05:37.647
Take a breath.

05:39.114 --> 05:41.651
-Come on.
-(exhales)

05:41.751 --> 05:43.986
It's gonna be perfect.

05:44.086 --> 05:45.955
I'm so proud of you.

05:46.055 --> 05:49.725
Mm-hmm. Mm.

05:49.825 --> 05:52.662
-I'm the luckiest motherfucker
in the world.
-(laughs)

05:52.762 --> 05:54.564
DJ (over radio):
It's just in front of 5:00

05:54.664 --> 05:56.566
at AM stereo KDAY
Santa Monica and...

05:56.666 --> 05:58.000
You ain't going
too short, right?

05:58.100 --> 06:00.002
I got you, baby.

06:00.102 --> 06:02.337
Hey, Fatback,
he going too short?

06:04.339 --> 06:06.776
(laughing):
Oh, shit!

06:06.876 --> 06:08.944
What?

06:09.044 --> 06:11.514
What? Oh, come on.

06:11.614 --> 06:13.683
Leon told me to dress nice.

06:13.783 --> 06:16.452
Shit. Nice according to who,
the Solid Go dancers?

06:16.552 --> 06:19.154
Hey, you good, Rob.
Don't listen to him.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.090
-Hey, we cool?
-BARBER: We good, man.

06:21.190 --> 06:23.258
-Hey, you got a minute?
-Come on, little nigga.

06:23.358 --> 06:26.361
-Rock sell over there.
-Man, I ain't want no rock.

06:26.462 --> 06:28.030
I'm trying to get on.
Heard you was the man to see.

06:28.130 --> 06:29.765
-FATBACK: Hey, come back later.
-Like, when?

06:29.865 --> 06:30.833
Like when you get some hair

06:30.933 --> 06:33.168
on your little balls.
Watch out, yo.

06:35.204 --> 06:36.806
Hey, man, come on, man,
give me a chance.

06:36.906 --> 06:38.974
All right, I'm ready.
Man, I'll sell that shit like

06:39.074 --> 06:41.611
-you ain't never seen.
-Get your bitch ass out
of here, man. We said no.

06:41.711 --> 06:44.814
-Leon, man, come on.
-Ain't you got to be in school
or something like that?

06:44.914 --> 06:46.882
*

06:50.520 --> 06:54.724
(chuckles) I have another
question for you, Reed.

06:54.824 --> 06:56.792
I love Los Angeles.

06:56.892 --> 07:00.295
Go every few months,
I stay at the Chateau,

07:00.395 --> 07:01.697
eat at Mr. Chow.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.365
Party...
(chuckles)

07:03.465 --> 07:05.868
well, everywhere.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.671
-(chuckles)
-This time,

07:08.771 --> 07:10.372
we went to the Roxy,
you know it?

07:10.472 --> 07:11.741
TEDDY:
Oh, yeah.

07:11.841 --> 07:13.876
-Yeah, on Sunset.
-RIGO: On Sunset, right.

07:13.976 --> 07:17.747
I'm there, when I see
Burt "Rentals" come in.

07:19.749 --> 07:22.184
(chuckles):
Oh, come on. Burt Rentals.

07:22.284 --> 07:24.854
Burt Rentals!
I can't believe it.

07:24.954 --> 07:27.923
I want to say hello to him,
but he is on his way upstairs

07:28.023 --> 07:31.026
to a private club.
(chuckles)

07:36.666 --> 07:40.736
I was so angry.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.841
The shame of being nothing.

07:48.043 --> 07:50.345
-Okay.
-Fuck that place!

07:50.445 --> 07:52.181
I never go back there!

07:52.281 --> 07:55.785
I want to start my fucking
private club next door!

07:58.788 --> 08:00.255
(sniffs)

08:00.355 --> 08:03.959
(chuckles):
And I want you to be my partner.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.295
Sorry, what?

08:06.395 --> 08:08.764
Wh-Wh-Wh-What, what?

08:08.864 --> 08:12.768
Right now, we are connected
in business only.

08:12.868 --> 08:16.639
This is something we can do
that will entwine us,

08:16.739 --> 08:20.475
ensure we are both
in the circle together,

08:20.576 --> 08:22.945
the true fucking partners.

08:23.045 --> 08:25.314
-Yeah, um, yeah. That's...
-Yeah.

08:25.414 --> 08:27.817
You know, obviously, I'd love
to be in the circle with you.

08:27.917 --> 08:30.119
You know that. I just... I don't
know anything about nightclubs.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.421
You know the city.

08:32.521 --> 08:35.591
And between us,

08:35.691 --> 08:38.961
we have more money than Dios.

08:42.798 --> 08:45.935
Unless you know of a reason why

08:46.035 --> 08:49.004
you don't want to be my partner.

08:51.173 --> 08:53.175
Listen, um...

08:55.577 --> 08:57.780
...before we agree to this,

08:57.880 --> 09:00.182
I-I think there's something
that you probably need to know.

09:00.282 --> 09:03.686
It's a little tricky, but, um...

09:03.786 --> 09:06.455
Okay. The DEA raids
on your facility,

09:06.555 --> 09:08.523
-it was on the news,
but that's not how I...
-(chuckles)

09:08.624 --> 09:10.125
...I-I first heard about it.

09:10.225 --> 09:12.161
See, I first heard about it
from Lorena,

09:12.261 --> 09:15.530
because she used to be DEA.

09:24.506 --> 09:26.776
What was it that turned you?

09:28.010 --> 09:29.945
Reed, here,

09:30.045 --> 09:32.381
he convinced me that I was
fighting an unwinnable war.

09:32.481 --> 09:34.483
So...

09:40.690 --> 09:42.658
Thanks.

09:42.758 --> 09:45.360
Thanks for your honesty.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.296
It means everything.

09:50.065 --> 09:54.036
So, let me know
when you've found our space.

09:54.136 --> 09:57.539
To Rigo and Reed's.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.475
(laughs):
That sounds good.

10:00.575 --> 10:03.312
That sounds good. See you.

10:03.412 --> 10:05.247
Hasta luego.

10:05.347 --> 10:06.916
(laughing):
Hasta luego.

10:07.016 --> 10:09.084
"To Rigo and Reed's."

10:09.184 --> 10:10.753
Oh, come on.

10:12.755 --> 10:14.323
-TEDDY: You good?
-Uh-huh.

10:20.763 --> 10:23.999
-* Five minutes of funk... *
-(indistinct chatter)

10:24.099 --> 10:26.501
PEACHES:
All I'm saying,
you should've asked us first.

10:26.601 --> 10:28.871
JEROME:
Jammin' Jeromes is the best
shit out. Ain't nothing better.

10:28.971 --> 10:30.706
PEACHES:
What about, like,
Saints' Sexy Sounds?

10:30.806 --> 10:33.542
-Broken Boxes and Bullshit.
-(both laugh)

10:33.642 --> 10:35.277
Leather and Loud Shit.

10:35.377 --> 10:37.279
Hunky Unkie's Sultry Sounds.

10:37.379 --> 10:39.749
Y'all niggas funny. I'm gonna
get my pistol, though, for you.

10:39.849 --> 10:42.251
Y'all fucking...
fucking up in my shit.

10:42.351 --> 10:46.021
I have to say, I had my doubts,
but I was wrong.

10:46.121 --> 10:47.422
This is wonderful, Jerome.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.258
Mom and Dad would be so proud.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.193
JEROME:
Thank you so much, Cissy.

10:51.293 --> 10:52.594
Thank you
for coming by, too, Alton.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.230
Black-owned business
in a black neighborhood.

10:55.330 --> 10:56.799
Congratulations, my brother.

10:56.899 --> 10:58.233
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

10:58.333 --> 11:00.736
You know, this is just
the start, too.

11:00.836 --> 11:03.038
-ALTON: This is just the start?
-Going nationwide next year.

11:03.138 --> 11:05.741
-Ooh.
-Be bigger than that...
RadioShack?

11:05.841 --> 11:08.811
-(laughter)
-Oh, no.
Make sure this one work first.

11:08.911 --> 11:11.446
FRANKLIN:
Was hoping I'd see you here.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.249
Eva and Shon-Shon.
How y'all doing? Good?

11:14.349 --> 11:17.052
-Not as good as y'all.
-Better if somebody'd

11:17.152 --> 11:18.821
-offer us a fucking drink.
-Hey.

11:18.921 --> 11:20.455
This is my best friend, Leon.
You met him?

11:20.555 --> 11:22.257
Hey. Well, the bar this way.
So, let's go.

11:22.357 --> 11:24.293
-Grab me something, all right?
-Yeah.
-Damn.

11:24.393 --> 11:27.296
Look at you. You look great.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.298
I feel great.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.800
Got into Spelman.

11:30.900 --> 11:34.503
Wow. That's... that's amazing.

11:34.603 --> 11:35.938
Congratulations.

11:36.038 --> 11:38.173
So, uh, guess that means
you leaving us now?

11:38.273 --> 11:39.909
-Not till next month.
-Okay.

11:40.009 --> 11:41.777
-Classes don't start
till September, but...
-Mm-hmm.

11:41.877 --> 11:43.745
I want to get settled,
find a job.

11:43.846 --> 11:46.248
A job? Nah, you got to be
on them books 24/7.

11:46.348 --> 11:49.284
Here. Yep.

11:49.384 --> 11:51.286
-Franklin, no.
-Been meaning to give you

11:51.386 --> 11:53.022
a graduation gift anyway.

11:53.122 --> 11:55.124
So you can focus on school.

11:55.224 --> 11:57.259
* Your master rapper,
but when I'm on the mic... *

11:57.359 --> 12:00.129
Come on,
it's the least I can do.

12:01.831 --> 12:04.834
JEROME:
Hey, picture time!

12:04.934 --> 12:06.535
Family, I need you outside.

12:06.635 --> 12:09.371
If you ain't my goddamn family,
stay out my fucking frame.

12:09.471 --> 12:12.674
(chuckles)
Come on.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.643
-Okay, come on.
-JEROME: Come on.

12:14.743 --> 12:16.311
JEROME:
All right,
everybody outside. Come on.

12:16.411 --> 12:18.147
He ain't took a picture
in 15 years.

12:18.247 --> 12:19.714
MAN:
Well, hey, uh,
don't worry about that.

12:19.815 --> 12:21.483
JEROME:
You know how to use it, though?

12:21.583 --> 12:23.685
MAN:
Just tell us where
you want us to go, Jerome.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.021
Hey y'all, come on, let's take
this picture so we can...

12:26.121 --> 12:27.556
Oh, no, you go ahead.
It's all right.

12:27.656 --> 12:29.391
Come on, man, get in here.
Hey, where Opie at?

12:29.491 --> 12:31.726
Bring old man Peaches
up in here.

12:31.827 --> 12:33.728
(chatter continues indistinctly)

12:33.829 --> 12:35.364
JEROME:
Come on in. Hey, Opie!

12:35.464 --> 12:37.332
There it is.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.911
-TEDDY: You okay
to start unloading?
-MATT: Yeah.

12:56.751 --> 12:58.687
LORENA:
We can't ignore this.

12:58.787 --> 13:00.856
If the Medellín Cartel
has a source inside the DEA,

13:00.956 --> 13:03.025
-we have to alert them.
-I hear you, but listen.

13:03.125 --> 13:04.894
You start rattling
those cages now,

13:04.994 --> 13:06.996
and then Rigo's gonna know
that you're still in contact

13:07.096 --> 13:09.364
with the DEA;
then we're all at risk.

13:09.464 --> 13:11.733
Teddy? These are federal agents.
They're good people.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.835
I'm not gonna let this go,
and neither should you.

13:13.936 --> 13:16.171
Okay, so let me take care of it.

13:16.271 --> 13:17.907
I can have word trickle down
some other way,

13:18.007 --> 13:19.508
some way that doesn't
lead back to us.

13:19.608 --> 13:22.677
-MATT (groaning): Help!
Teddy! Ted...
-Matt?

13:22.777 --> 13:25.881
-Matt? Matt?
-(groaning)

13:25.981 --> 13:27.116
Whoa. What's wrong?

13:27.216 --> 13:29.084
You okay?

13:29.184 --> 13:31.220
-Whoa, whoa. Okay, okay, okay.
Whoa, whoa. What's...
-Fuck.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.222
-What hurts?
-(straining): My, um...

13:33.322 --> 13:35.290
Did you have any numbness
in your hands today?

13:35.390 --> 13:37.859
Do you have any nausea?

13:37.960 --> 13:40.462
-Yeah.
-Yeah? He's having
a heart attack.

13:40.562 --> 13:43.098
(Matt panting, groaning)

13:51.040 --> 13:53.042
(radio playing
indistinctly)

13:54.709 --> 13:57.446
-(sighs)
-(door opens)

14:00.815 --> 14:03.986
Oh, come on.
I'm only 13 minutes late.

14:04.086 --> 14:05.320
Hey. (chuckles)

14:05.420 --> 14:07.422
It's not my fault.

14:07.522 --> 14:10.259
-Eva didn't want to leave.
-Listen, it's okay.

14:10.359 --> 14:12.761
I don't want to spend our
last month together fighting.

14:12.861 --> 14:14.796
All right?

14:14.896 --> 14:16.331
Besides, it's not like
I can come down

14:16.431 --> 14:17.899
and check on you
every night at school.

14:19.935 --> 14:22.104
Here, sit with me a minute.

14:27.943 --> 14:29.478
What's all this?

14:29.578 --> 14:33.615
Ah, it's bills, taxes.

14:33.715 --> 14:35.684
Life.

14:37.686 --> 14:39.188
You have fun?

14:39.288 --> 14:41.957
-It was okay.
-Just you and Eva?

14:42.057 --> 14:43.959
-And Shon-Shon.
-And Shon-Shon.

14:44.059 --> 14:45.527
Shon-Shon,
she the one who came in

14:45.627 --> 14:47.262
-with the hickey on her neck?
-Dad.

14:47.362 --> 14:49.331
-What?
-Come on.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.300
What'd y'all do?

14:51.400 --> 14:54.970
-We went ice fishing.
-Ice fishing, huh?

14:55.070 --> 14:56.271
Did you catch anything?

14:56.371 --> 14:57.472
(both chuckle)

14:57.572 --> 14:59.008
Yeah.

14:59.108 --> 15:00.475
One of them big ones.

15:00.575 --> 15:02.277
You know, with the long,
pointy nose.

15:02.377 --> 15:04.713
-Ooh, a marlin.
-A marlin.

15:04.813 --> 15:07.482
Yeah. But, uh, Eva slipped,

15:07.582 --> 15:09.684
dropped the rod,
and it got away.

15:09.784 --> 15:12.554
(laughing):
That's too bad.

15:14.556 --> 15:16.825
Oh, man.

15:16.925 --> 15:19.528
So, uh...

15:20.996 --> 15:23.498
Word is Franklin's uncle
has a new speaker joint

15:23.598 --> 15:25.800
over off Western.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.869
Hear anything about that?

15:29.838 --> 15:31.240
(scoffs)

15:32.407 --> 15:34.009
Wow.

15:34.109 --> 15:36.678
(sighs)
Mel, Mel.

15:41.350 --> 15:43.518
What I said earlier is true.

15:43.618 --> 15:46.221
I don't want to fight.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.257
You've worked so hard.

15:48.357 --> 15:50.492
You've done everything I asked.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.663
I just want you to be smart.

15:54.763 --> 15:57.399
Anything else?

15:58.433 --> 16:00.435
I love you.

16:00.535 --> 16:02.537
*

16:24.726 --> 16:27.362
-DEJON: Man, I been
wanting to fuck her.
-(laughter)

16:27.462 --> 16:29.931
Nah, man, that bitch
got summer teeth, you know?

16:30.031 --> 16:31.866
Sum...?

16:31.966 --> 16:34.236
-You know, some are here,
some are there.
-(chuckles)

16:34.336 --> 16:35.637
Her teeth are
kind of fucked up.

16:35.737 --> 16:37.606
Hey, I got to piss.

16:37.706 --> 16:39.474
(exhales)
Some bushes over there, bro.

16:39.574 --> 16:41.276
Look, I ain't pissing
in no bushes.

16:41.376 --> 16:43.612
-Then hold it, nigga.
-I ain't good to hold it.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.415
That shit causes bacteria,
give you a bladder infection.

16:46.515 --> 16:47.916
How the fuck you know that,
nigga?

16:48.016 --> 16:49.751
'Cause my mama a nurse's aide.

16:49.851 --> 16:53.422
-Yeah. Shit, hey,
your mama can nurse me.
-(laughs)

16:53.522 --> 16:55.924
Man, hey,
we've been long enough.

16:56.024 --> 16:59.561
-Let's roll.
-Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

16:59.661 --> 17:02.664
(starts engine)

17:04.299 --> 17:06.101
-GIRL: There it is!
-WOMAN: Yeah, ice cream.

17:06.201 --> 17:07.436
(indistinct chatter)

17:11.573 --> 17:14.176
-All right. You all right there?
-Yeah, we good, man.

17:14.276 --> 17:15.510
DEJON:
See that shit?

17:15.610 --> 17:18.780
-Hell yeah. Hell yeah.
-(sighing)

17:18.880 --> 17:20.249
Ah, shit.

17:20.349 --> 17:22.617
Hey, what-what the fuck
you two doing?

17:22.717 --> 17:24.453
That the re-up truck, nigga.

17:24.553 --> 17:26.188
Means it's loaded
with cash and rock.

17:26.288 --> 17:27.989
TYRELL:
Also mean them boys strapped.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.625
And Manboy told us scope out
the projects, not rob no truck.

17:30.725 --> 17:32.127
We only scoping the niggas out

17:32.227 --> 17:33.928
so we can rob these
motherfuckers.

17:34.028 --> 17:36.298
Once we get the shit, you just
make sure you're ready, a'ight?

17:36.398 --> 17:38.333
Nigga, I ain't no
getaway driver.

17:40.169 --> 17:41.836
Hey!

17:43.872 --> 17:45.106
Shit.

17:56.818 --> 17:58.653
(gunshot)

17:58.753 --> 17:59.954
-MAN: Oh, shit!
-(frantic chatter)

18:00.054 --> 18:01.656
Come on.

18:02.857 --> 18:03.992
(groans)

18:04.092 --> 18:05.059
Oh, shit.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.296
(tires screeching)

18:08.830 --> 18:10.365
(gunfire continues)

18:14.469 --> 18:15.737
Motherfucker!

18:30.185 --> 18:31.653
-Levon and Dejon?
-They brothers.

18:31.753 --> 18:34.055
Used to stay off Hoover.
Word is they with Manboy.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.490
LOUIE:
Who the fuck is Manboy?

18:35.590 --> 18:37.326
Drew Miller.
We all went to Foshay together,

18:37.426 --> 18:39.694
before his family
moved Eastside.

18:39.794 --> 18:43.232
-Fuck kind of name is Manboy?
-Who gives a shit?
Why he all up in our business?

18:43.332 --> 18:45.900
Look, word is they cook and sell
their own shit for a while.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.336
Maybe looking to expand.

18:47.436 --> 18:49.771
But we got to answer
this shit, Saint.

18:52.874 --> 18:54.576
I want to know everything:

18:54.676 --> 18:56.411
where they stay at,

18:56.511 --> 18:59.348
where they sell, where they cook

18:59.448 --> 19:02.351
and who the fuck put them
on our truck.

19:08.623 --> 19:10.091
BOOTSY:
Hold up.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.760
Are you saying
them boys is dead?

19:11.860 --> 19:13.362
Yeah. I told them niggas
that shit was

19:13.462 --> 19:15.096
seven kinds of stupid,
but they wouldn't hear me.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.466
They just ran up on them niggas
like they was the A-Team.

19:17.566 --> 19:19.200
You dumb motherfuckers.

19:19.301 --> 19:22.271
I told y'all
who them projects belong to.

19:22.371 --> 19:24.306
Was you even listening
to my story?

19:24.406 --> 19:26.908
-You should've stopped them.
-I fucking tried!

19:27.008 --> 19:29.944
-And a fine fucking job you did!
-Hey, chill!

19:30.044 --> 19:31.580
You know how them niggas was.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.249
You couldn't tell them shit.

19:34.349 --> 19:35.984
This ain't on Tyrell.

19:36.084 --> 19:38.420
I didn't teach y'all
how to cook up this rock

19:38.520 --> 19:40.322
so you could get us all killed.

19:40.422 --> 19:42.924
You best figure out
how to handle this shit.

19:43.024 --> 19:44.926
'Cause Saint and 'em,
they don't play.

19:45.026 --> 19:46.561
Hey, look, first,

19:46.661 --> 19:49.230
I need you to tell me everything
you know about Saint,

19:49.331 --> 19:51.766
your boy Leon,

19:51.866 --> 19:54.168
and everybody else
in their crew.

19:54.269 --> 19:57.439
-Okay? Okay?
-Okay. Okay.

20:07.015 --> 20:09.117
(train horn blaring)

20:20.529 --> 20:22.196
You're late.

20:28.703 --> 20:31.139
Just thought you ain't never
been late before.

20:31.239 --> 20:33.975
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, I just hit a little snag.

20:34.075 --> 20:35.344
It's nothing you need
to worry about,

20:35.444 --> 20:37.111
but, uh, I am gonna need
a little more time

20:37.211 --> 20:38.447
to get you the product.

20:38.547 --> 20:39.848
How much time?

20:39.948 --> 20:42.351
Not long. just a few days.

20:42.451 --> 20:45.487
I'll let you know when
we're ready for... for pickup.

20:46.521 --> 20:47.989
That it?

20:48.089 --> 20:49.958
Uh, no, listen.

20:50.058 --> 20:51.826
Uh, prices are rising.

20:51.926 --> 20:53.695
So, for the foreseeable future,

20:53.795 --> 20:56.865
-we're gonna be dealing
at 15 a key.
-15?

20:56.965 --> 20:59.401
50% hike, just like that?

20:59.501 --> 21:00.969
Yeah.

21:01.069 --> 21:02.504
You watch the news?

21:02.604 --> 21:04.373
-Read the newspaper?
-Yeah.

21:04.473 --> 21:06.808
Right, so then you know
that the DEA

21:06.908 --> 21:08.343
is on a rampage
down in Colombia.

21:08.443 --> 21:09.844
Yeah, I know that, but I just

21:09.944 --> 21:12.013
kind of thought
you was immune to that shit.

21:12.113 --> 21:14.816
What?

21:17.352 --> 21:19.020
You know, thought...
thought you was immune.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.055
You thought that I was
immune to what,

21:21.155 --> 21:23.525
supply and demand, or...?

21:23.625 --> 21:26.060
Never mind.
15's fine, hmm?

21:26.160 --> 21:27.596
Yeah, no, no, I know it's fine.

21:27.696 --> 21:29.531
I just... I'm just curious...

21:29.631 --> 21:31.733
why it is you think
that I'm not subject

21:31.833 --> 21:34.235
to the basic laws of economics.

21:39.908 --> 21:42.043
Hey, Franklin?

21:42.143 --> 21:44.446
I don't know what it is
you think you know,

21:44.546 --> 21:47.048
but I urge you to remember
that I am the only reason

21:47.148 --> 21:48.750
that you are breathing free air
right now.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.352
I'll put you back in that cell
any goddamn time I want.

21:54.556 --> 21:57.358
Someone will be in touch
about the shipment.

21:57.459 --> 21:59.628
(car door opens)

22:00.795 --> 22:03.097
(engine starts)

22:21.750 --> 22:23.985
Mm, you forgot
to sign this page.

22:24.085 --> 22:25.386
Did I? Sure.

22:28.322 --> 22:31.493
(Franklin clears throat, sighs)

22:31.593 --> 22:34.563
And you forgot to sign
this page.

22:34.663 --> 22:35.997
Sorry.

22:41.770 --> 22:44.673
Okay. What?

22:44.773 --> 22:47.275
-Nothing.
-Mm-mm. That's not gonna fly.

22:47.375 --> 22:49.110
What was our deal?

22:50.645 --> 22:54.449
You ask, and I tell you.

22:54.549 --> 22:57.285
-The truth.
-So, what is it?

22:57.385 --> 23:00.088
Something about that shooting
in the projects the other night?

23:00.188 --> 23:02.156
-Nah.
-Then what is it?

23:03.658 --> 23:05.660
It's Reed Thompson.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.762
What about him?

23:07.862 --> 23:12.433
Well... I may have overstepped.

23:12.534 --> 23:14.335
Said something I shouldn't have.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.104
Like what?

23:18.106 --> 23:20.809
-Franklin, you said
he needed you.
-I know. I know.

23:20.909 --> 23:22.443
That you had to be in this,

23:22.544 --> 23:25.179
but as long as you're pushing
his-his product,

23:25.279 --> 23:27.616
-he would protect you.
-And I still believe that.

23:27.716 --> 23:29.150
So, what's the problem?

23:32.320 --> 23:34.856
Mm.

23:37.225 --> 23:40.061
I've had some terrible days
in my life.

23:41.663 --> 23:45.700
But nothing worse
than when I saw your face

23:45.800 --> 23:47.536
behind that glass.

23:50.004 --> 23:53.341
I'm in with you on this,
from now on.

23:54.643 --> 23:56.711
You said you had it
under control.

23:56.811 --> 24:00.181
And I'm happy to do
everything I can to help.

24:00.281 --> 24:03.251
But it's up to you
to protect everyone.

24:04.886 --> 24:07.188
Can you do it or not?

24:10.725 --> 24:13.595
Of course.

24:31.079 --> 24:33.047
(engine shuts off)

24:33.147 --> 24:35.116
(alarm beeping)

24:37.719 --> 24:39.353
(buttons beeping)

24:39.453 --> 24:40.755
(alarm stops)

24:45.594 --> 24:47.596
*

25:05.146 --> 25:07.148
*

25:37.178 --> 25:39.948
-(insects chirping)
-(engine shuts off)

25:42.684 --> 25:44.686
(door creaks open)

25:44.786 --> 25:47.088
-(TV plays indistinctly)
-MATT: Hey, Pops.

25:47.188 --> 25:49.323
(door closes)

25:49.423 --> 25:51.292
Pops?

25:52.326 --> 25:54.328
Hey. Welcome home, boy.

25:57.999 --> 26:00.034
(chuckles)
How's the ticker?

26:00.134 --> 26:01.502
Uh...

26:01.602 --> 26:03.437
she's still ticking.

26:03.537 --> 26:06.040
Yeah, I-I went ahead
and-and, uh, briefed Dr. Wills.

26:06.140 --> 26:07.776
You have an appointment
Friday morning

26:07.876 --> 26:09.310
-at 1000.
-Mm-hmm.

26:09.410 --> 26:10.812
Get this thing a second look.

26:10.912 --> 26:12.480
Yes, sir.

26:14.482 --> 26:15.817
Theodore.

26:15.917 --> 26:17.819
Sir.

26:17.919 --> 26:20.621
You're looking well.

26:20.722 --> 26:22.323
As are you.

26:24.458 --> 26:27.128
You hungry?

26:27.228 --> 26:28.830
I'm just tired.

26:28.930 --> 26:31.800
Yeah, I-I made up the spare,
so, uh... in the back.

26:31.900 --> 26:33.702
I-I wasn't sure
if you'd both be staying.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.870
I-I just figured
I'd stay on the couch.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.706
-If that's all right.
-That's fine.

26:37.806 --> 26:40.809
Yeah. Come on,
let's-let's, uh...

26:40.909 --> 26:42.310
It's good to see you.

26:42.410 --> 26:44.578
MATT:
Yeah.

26:44.679 --> 26:47.581
-COLONEL: Let me get that.
I got it. I got it.
-(Matt sighs)

26:54.588 --> 26:56.590
(Teddy sighs)

27:03.998 --> 27:07.702
Cookhouse on Avalon
and Manboy's crib on Rosecrans.

27:07.802 --> 27:09.570
Now, they got dealers
working the Pueblos...

27:09.670 --> 27:12.206
FRANKLIN:
Cut the head off,
the body will fall.

27:12.306 --> 27:13.775
How many folks you need?

27:13.875 --> 27:16.210
Four for each house.
We got to talk artillery.

27:16.310 --> 27:18.679
-I mean, the pistols
will get it done...
-(door opens)

27:18.780 --> 27:20.514
...but we want to get
our hands on something heavy.

27:20.614 --> 27:24.018
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh...

27:24.118 --> 27:26.087
Manboy here to see y'all.

27:28.923 --> 27:31.292
Manboy? You sure?

27:31.392 --> 27:32.861
Well, I ain't ever met the
nigga, but that's what he say.

27:32.961 --> 27:34.428
-He alone?
-Look that way.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.865
Is he strapped?

27:40.234 --> 27:43.304
Hey. Make sure he clean,
then send him in.

27:44.372 --> 27:45.807
Fatback.

27:45.907 --> 27:47.241
Keep a lookout.

27:47.341 --> 27:49.310
Make sure it ain't
a setup. Peach.

27:49.410 --> 27:51.913
Okay.

27:52.947 --> 27:54.816
Leon.

28:04.558 --> 28:07.428
Y'all don't play
with that security, huh?

28:07.528 --> 28:10.398
Feel like I should tip them
niggas, pat-down I just got.

28:11.933 --> 28:14.002
'Sup, Lee? 'Sup, Saint?

28:14.102 --> 28:15.503
-'Sup, Drew?
-It's been a minute.

28:15.603 --> 28:17.338
Been more than that.

28:18.973 --> 28:20.508
You must be Jammin' Jerome.

28:20.608 --> 28:23.311
Niggas out in Compton
talk about your shit.

28:23.411 --> 28:25.579
Woofers blowing panties
clean off.

28:28.249 --> 28:31.119
My bad. I didn't know
there was a female in the house.

28:31.219 --> 28:32.921
How you doing? My name is Drew.

28:33.021 --> 28:34.522
Everybody call me Manboy.

28:34.622 --> 28:36.757
-I'm Louie.
-MANBOY: Oowie.

28:36.858 --> 28:39.293
Louie. How you end up
with these...

28:39.393 --> 28:41.662
-these undesirables?
-Hey, little boy.

28:43.164 --> 28:45.499
The fuck you want here?

28:45.599 --> 28:47.668
Guess you with him, huh?

28:49.603 --> 28:51.505
I mean, I'll cut
straight to it if y'all...

28:51.605 --> 28:53.207
I think that'd be best.

28:53.307 --> 28:55.343
I'm a businessman.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.812
Being as such,
I'd say it'd be in my interest

28:57.912 --> 28:59.313
to know what
the competition up to.

28:59.413 --> 29:01.850
Unfortunately,
a couple of my associates

29:01.950 --> 29:03.684
took that notion
a little too far.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.219
You mean, tried to rob us?

29:05.319 --> 29:07.721
That is indeed what I mean.

29:07.822 --> 29:10.291
But I thought, seeing as though
how y'all ain't

29:10.391 --> 29:12.060
out your rock or your cash,

29:12.160 --> 29:14.062
and two of mine
are already cooling,

29:14.162 --> 29:16.164
you'll give me a chance
to square us.

29:16.264 --> 29:18.166
How you gonna do that?

29:18.266 --> 29:20.568
MANBOY:
First, I get my product
from y'all.

29:21.735 --> 29:23.304
Y'all shit cheaper and purer

29:23.404 --> 29:25.039
than anything
we're cooking up anyway.

29:25.139 --> 29:27.408
That's it? That's your shit?

29:29.410 --> 29:32.513
And I give you the nigga
that got away in the projects.

29:32.613 --> 29:34.382
Say what?

29:34.482 --> 29:36.184
The driver.

29:36.284 --> 29:37.886
I'll tell you where
he hiding out at.

29:37.986 --> 29:40.254
Could do with him as you will.

29:41.322 --> 29:42.823
That's my offer.

29:44.525 --> 29:46.094
What y'all think?

29:49.697 --> 29:51.232
I think,

29:51.332 --> 29:55.503
24 hours,
either your boy'll be dead

29:55.603 --> 29:57.838
and we'd be in business,

29:57.939 --> 30:00.241
or you...

30:00.341 --> 30:02.010
and everybody you know
will be gone.

30:04.345 --> 30:05.779
And we won't.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.182
Either way, you'll know soon.

30:09.717 --> 30:12.186
You want the address
where my boy holing up at?

30:12.286 --> 30:13.587
-Just in case?
-Nah.

30:13.687 --> 30:15.890
We already got it.

30:15.990 --> 30:17.959
(chuckles)

30:18.059 --> 30:19.760
Thank y'all for y'all time.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.562
I'm-a show myself out.

30:23.031 --> 30:24.966
MANBOY:
Bye, Leon.

30:25.066 --> 30:26.567
Our boys, they grew up, man.

30:26.667 --> 30:28.536
-Good to see you.
-Just get the fuck out.

30:28.636 --> 30:30.204
All right.

30:38.646 --> 30:40.648
(birds chirping)

30:58.232 --> 31:01.502
-Morning.
-Morning.

31:03.504 --> 31:04.939
You want coffee?

31:05.039 --> 31:07.008
I had mine hours ago.

31:11.812 --> 31:14.348
(grumbles)

31:17.851 --> 31:21.122
How're the tomatoes doing
this year?

31:21.222 --> 31:23.791
Goddamn deer
keep getting in 'em.

31:25.994 --> 31:28.429
I should shoot 'em.

31:28.529 --> 31:31.966
No... I wouldn't shoot
the tomatoes, sir.

31:32.066 --> 31:34.635
God forbid someone
discharge a firearm

31:34.735 --> 31:36.537
in their own backyard.

31:36.637 --> 31:39.207
(newspaper rustling)

31:39.307 --> 31:41.809
I'm gonna get some coffee.

31:43.844 --> 31:45.646
What happened to your brother?

31:48.349 --> 31:50.018
I told you he's...
there's damage

31:50.118 --> 31:51.652
to the lining of his aorta.

31:51.752 --> 31:54.555
West Point, flight school,
Vietnam.

31:54.655 --> 31:56.024
Strong as an ox, that boy.

31:56.124 --> 31:58.993
He ran through walls
his entire life.

31:59.093 --> 32:01.629
What was that thing
you used to say?

32:01.729 --> 32:03.364
"Ships and harbor are safe,

32:03.464 --> 32:05.566
but that ain't
what ships are for."

32:05.666 --> 32:08.736
Yeah, but some captains
bring their crews home intact.

32:10.804 --> 32:12.373
So, what now?

32:12.473 --> 32:14.175
A few more days,
and you run off?

32:14.275 --> 32:16.710
Back to the land
of the fruits and nuts and...

32:16.810 --> 32:18.579
leave me to take care of him?

32:19.580 --> 32:22.016
I have money.

32:22.116 --> 32:23.651
I'll hire help for both of you.

32:23.751 --> 32:25.253
Oh, that'll solve it.

32:29.523 --> 32:31.525
I have work to do.

32:31.625 --> 32:32.926
(laughing):
What's that?

32:33.027 --> 32:34.928
Shuffling papers
for the State Department?

32:35.029 --> 32:37.265
What is so important
that you can't clean up

32:37.365 --> 32:38.932
your own goddamn mess?

32:40.401 --> 32:43.071
Certainly isn't looking after
your own family.

32:45.106 --> 32:46.607
I'll keep sending the money.

32:46.707 --> 32:49.009
Yeah, keep your guilt money.
We don't want it.

32:49.110 --> 32:51.079
Take care of yourself.

32:55.183 --> 32:57.185
*

33:09.630 --> 33:12.066
(alarm bell ringing)

33:12.166 --> 33:14.135
(ringing continues)

33:19.307 --> 33:20.974
Motherfucker!

33:49.837 --> 33:52.806
Met with our LAPD friend today.

33:52.906 --> 33:56.076
It was Claudia,
that shit at Jerome's.

33:56.177 --> 33:57.911
He sure?

33:58.011 --> 33:59.480
Yeah, he's still
on her payroll, too.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.915
I guess she tried
to get him to go at us,

34:02.015 --> 34:05.319
and when he refused,
she found somebody else.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.455
And I guess you ain't
told Jerome yet.

34:07.555 --> 34:09.523
You crazy? Hell no.

34:09.623 --> 34:12.293
Shit, he'd fucking be shooting
that club up as we speak.

34:12.393 --> 34:14.762
No, he think it's kids.
I'm gonna let him think it.

34:14.862 --> 34:16.797
Yeah. Well, we got
a lot on our plate

34:16.897 --> 34:18.766
without worrying about
fucking Claudia.

34:18.866 --> 34:21.635
(sighing):
Yeah. I mean...

34:21.735 --> 34:25.539
I'll try and talk some sense
to her before we act.

34:29.343 --> 34:30.844
Okay.

34:36.550 --> 34:37.951
Love you.

34:39.019 --> 34:41.322
(engine starts)

34:51.699 --> 34:53.167
ERNESTO:
Hey, chiquita.

34:54.968 --> 34:57.538
I'm dying of thirst over here.

34:57.638 --> 35:00.408
If only that were true.

35:00.508 --> 35:02.643
How come you're always
ignoring me?

35:02.743 --> 35:04.144
Because you don't tip, pendejo.

35:04.245 --> 35:05.413
You want a tip?

35:05.513 --> 35:06.847
Just got to ask. (laughs)

35:06.947 --> 35:08.182
You motherfucker!

35:08.282 --> 35:10.251
Ah, come on, mijita.
(grunts)

35:10.351 --> 35:13.554
(patrons murmuring, shouting)

35:13.654 --> 35:15.889
-MAN: That's right, son.
-(indistinct shouting)

35:15.989 --> 35:16.890
(groaning)

35:16.990 --> 35:18.326
(gunshot)

35:18.426 --> 35:19.593
That's enough.

35:21.161 --> 35:22.730
Time to go.

35:23.997 --> 35:25.533
Vamonos.

35:25.633 --> 35:28.168
(Gustavo groans)

35:28.269 --> 35:30.238
Fuck.

35:30.338 --> 35:32.240
(sighs)

35:32.340 --> 35:36.877
Ugh. You're the worst bouncer
we've ever had.

35:36.977 --> 35:38.712
You should go to the hospital.

35:38.812 --> 35:40.548
No.

35:40.648 --> 35:42.450
No más hospitals.

35:44.051 --> 35:46.086
Then you're coming home with me.

35:46.186 --> 35:49.390
At least there
I can patch you up right.

35:49.490 --> 35:51.024
I'll be fine.

35:52.693 --> 35:54.362
Hey.

35:54.462 --> 35:57.398
You know she's not
coming back, right?

35:59.633 --> 36:01.902
(door opens)

36:02.002 --> 36:03.904
We're closed.

36:04.004 --> 36:05.473
(door shuts)

36:05.573 --> 36:07.775
TEDDY:
Even old friends?

36:11.912 --> 36:13.614
Hi, Gustavo.

36:15.316 --> 36:17.217
Got a minute?

36:19.253 --> 36:20.888
TEDDY:
I lost Matt.

36:22.122 --> 36:23.791
Means I'm down a pilot,

36:23.891 --> 36:27.160
and I have product that I need
to get across the border.

36:27.261 --> 36:30.464
And I was hoping to use
Lucia's family's farm

36:30.564 --> 36:32.266
and their routes.

36:32.366 --> 36:33.901
Lucia's gone.

36:34.001 --> 36:36.003
She left months ago.

36:36.103 --> 36:38.639
No idea where.

36:38.739 --> 36:40.841
You want her family routes?

36:40.941 --> 36:43.010
First, go find her.

36:43.110 --> 36:44.845
I tried.

36:44.945 --> 36:47.080
Only person there's
any record of is you.

36:47.180 --> 36:49.917
You get a lot
of parking tickets.

36:50.017 --> 36:53.186
Look, Lucia must have talked
about the place at some point.

36:53.287 --> 36:54.688
Where it is, who's still there.

36:54.788 --> 36:56.089
She hated it.

36:57.291 --> 36:59.760
She didn't talk to her mother.

36:59.860 --> 37:03.163
I don't see what
that has to do with you.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.132
Or business. I mean,
if they still have the farm,

37:05.232 --> 37:07.368
they still have the trucks,
they still have the routes.

37:07.468 --> 37:09.537
What do you want me to do?

37:09.637 --> 37:13.006
Hmm? Just show up and say,
"Hi, I'm Gustavo.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.343
I want to start
a cocaine business with you"?

37:15.443 --> 37:18.612
You'd be amazed
at how often that works.

37:18.712 --> 37:21.315
Or stay here, keep getting
the shit kicked out of you

37:21.415 --> 37:22.716
by drunk barflies.

37:22.816 --> 37:26.487
It doesn't matter to me.
I'll find someone else.

37:26.587 --> 37:29.523
Can I ask you one more question?

37:29.623 --> 37:32.626
If Lucia's been gone for months,
why are you still here?

37:33.961 --> 37:37.498
Just 'cause...

37:37.598 --> 37:40.468
if it was me

37:40.568 --> 37:42.836
and I was trying
to find my girl,

37:42.936 --> 37:46.674
I think that getting
into business with her family

37:46.774 --> 37:51.044
would be a pretty good place
to start.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.013
(doorbell rings)

37:53.113 --> 37:55.916
(door opens, shuts)

37:59.820 --> 38:01.589
It's Louie.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.895
Pat her down.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.602
(door opens)

38:32.119 --> 38:33.787
She's good.

38:36.624 --> 38:38.392
(door opens)

38:41.128 --> 38:42.896
(door closes)

38:46.299 --> 38:48.135
I have some things to say.

38:48.235 --> 38:49.703
Didn't think they could wait.

38:49.803 --> 38:52.205
Well, you better hurry up.
The tub's filling.

38:56.076 --> 39:00.047
I came to apologize, Claudia,

39:00.147 --> 39:02.215
for my part in what went down.

39:04.117 --> 39:05.986
I never meant for it
to go that way.

39:08.756 --> 39:11.158
But you hurt me.

39:11.258 --> 39:13.494
I hurt you?

39:13.594 --> 39:15.328
(chuckles)

39:16.396 --> 39:18.999
I know you're upset,

39:19.099 --> 39:23.904
but I'm here to tell you
to let it go.

39:24.004 --> 39:26.640
Let the past be the past.

39:28.442 --> 39:31.311
You ever have a migraine?

39:43.256 --> 39:45.959
The pain is crippling.

39:47.661 --> 39:50.464
I've been to more doctors
than the Elephant Man.

39:50.564 --> 39:53.834
I took all the pills.

39:53.934 --> 39:55.969
And when that didn't work...

39:59.507 --> 40:01.809
...I took matters
into my own hands.

40:05.813 --> 40:08.348
Care to join me?

40:24.464 --> 40:27.735
(water sloshing)

40:32.506 --> 40:34.642
Be a dear.

41:03.571 --> 41:05.338
See you in the morning.
Love you.

41:08.408 --> 41:11.211
Evening, Franklin.

41:11.311 --> 41:13.446
Been spending a lot of time
at your mama's house

41:13.547 --> 41:14.748
since you been out.

41:16.516 --> 41:19.019
Sure hope you don't have her
wrapped up in all this.

41:19.119 --> 41:21.088
I got someplace
I got to be, Andre.

41:21.188 --> 41:23.390
Afraid that's gonna
have to wait, son.

41:23.490 --> 41:26.594
I'm gonna need you
to take a ride with me.

41:29.229 --> 41:31.231
This official?

41:31.331 --> 41:32.700
Nah.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.569
It's just two neighbors talking.

41:41.541 --> 41:43.977
So, you're not gonna tell me
where we going?

41:48.582 --> 41:50.450
Let me ask you something.

41:52.586 --> 41:54.287
What you see
when you look at me?

41:54.387 --> 41:56.323
Huh?

41:56.423 --> 41:59.559
Certainly not the man
who you grew up with.

41:59.660 --> 42:01.795
Who helped raise you
after your daddy disappeared

42:01.895 --> 42:03.897
into that bottle.

42:05.232 --> 42:07.400
So, what is it?

42:07.500 --> 42:10.337
Gun and a badge,
overprotective father

42:10.437 --> 42:12.572
-or fucking asshole?
-You really want to know?

42:12.673 --> 42:16.143
-I really do.
-I see a fraud.

42:16.243 --> 42:17.778
A man who betrayed his people

42:17.878 --> 42:19.680
to a system built
to keep 'em down.

42:19.780 --> 42:22.149
(chuckles)

42:22.249 --> 42:23.784
Is that what you think?

42:25.018 --> 42:26.787
That I'm one of them?

42:27.855 --> 42:29.923
If the combat boot fits.

42:30.023 --> 42:31.458
Oh, damn.

42:31.558 --> 42:34.127
I mean, did it ever occur to you
that I was a spy?

42:34.227 --> 42:37.831
-(laughs)
-Doing time behind enemy lines.

42:37.931 --> 42:40.033
-Trying to protect my people
from that system.
-Oh, yeah?

42:40.133 --> 42:42.502
And how's that
working out for you?

42:43.671 --> 42:46.039
(shuts engine off)

42:46.139 --> 42:47.641
I don't know, pusher man.

42:47.741 --> 42:49.710
How's shit on your side
of the line?

42:49.810 --> 42:53.146
I see. I'm just some
nickel-and-dime thug, huh?

42:53.246 --> 42:56.116
In this for the cars
and pussy, right?

42:56.216 --> 42:58.185
If the gold chain fits.

43:01.689 --> 43:04.524
Ain't no rope
around my neck, Andre.

43:04.624 --> 43:06.960
Not like you.

43:07.060 --> 43:10.664
And Joe Kennedy,
he was nothing but mick trash...

43:10.764 --> 43:12.966
till he wasn't.

43:13.066 --> 43:15.168
And what'd he do?

43:15.268 --> 43:18.972
Lifted his family up,
and his boys...

43:19.072 --> 43:21.809
they ran this country.

43:21.909 --> 43:23.977
Now, that's real power.

43:24.077 --> 43:28.015
Not a policeman's salary.

43:28.115 --> 43:30.718
Taking orders from whitey.

43:32.920 --> 43:35.488
You really want to help
your people?

43:35.588 --> 43:38.058
Best thing you could do
is toss that badge

43:38.158 --> 43:40.761
back to the racist motherfuckers
that gave it to you,

43:40.861 --> 43:43.596
and get on my side.

43:47.367 --> 43:49.269
(sighs)
Unfortunately, Franklin,

43:49.369 --> 43:50.871
that's not gonna work for me.

43:50.971 --> 43:52.605
Don't knock it
till you tried it.

43:52.706 --> 43:54.942
That's just it.

43:55.042 --> 43:57.444
I already did.

43:59.679 --> 44:01.782
(laughing):
Bullshit.

44:01.882 --> 44:04.117
Bullshit.

44:06.186 --> 44:08.555
Been back from 'Nam
a few years.

44:08.655 --> 44:10.791
I was working at
the Chrysler plant in Commerce.

44:10.891 --> 44:13.761
When it closed,
my wife up and left.

44:13.861 --> 44:15.963
Baby girl to feed,
mortgage to pay.

44:17.564 --> 44:19.767
'Nam was a clusterfuck.

44:19.867 --> 44:23.203
But Uncle Sam taught me
a few things.

44:23.303 --> 44:25.205
How to secure a location
using force,

44:25.305 --> 44:28.275
take what I wanted
and get out.

44:28.375 --> 44:30.310
What the fuck you saying?

44:30.410 --> 44:33.213
Huh? You was a jacker?
A bank robber?

44:33.313 --> 44:34.614
What I'm saying is,

44:34.714 --> 44:36.416
you take something
from a man at gunpoint,

44:36.516 --> 44:38.118
you gonna feel a way about it.

44:40.053 --> 44:41.789
At least I did.

44:44.792 --> 44:48.495
Now, my bills were paid,
but I couldn't sleep.

44:48.595 --> 44:53.500
Got tired of imagining the cops
busting in my door.

44:53.600 --> 44:56.403
I still don't sleep
that good these days,

44:56.503 --> 45:00.440
but at least it ain't
my conscience keeping me up.

45:00.540 --> 45:03.343
Now, this rock
that you're selling,

45:03.443 --> 45:06.513
it's got a special hold.

45:06.613 --> 45:10.517
It ain't weed or sherm.

45:10.617 --> 45:15.455
It's doing real damage
out there.

45:15.555 --> 45:17.190
And I think you know it.

45:20.828 --> 45:23.797
So my question to you is...

45:25.598 --> 45:28.936
How you sleeping
at night, son?

45:32.139 --> 45:33.874
Like a baby.

45:42.549 --> 45:46.987
Well, now, you and me...

45:47.087 --> 45:50.123
we at war.

45:50.223 --> 45:53.560
Your business
has gotten too big,

45:53.660 --> 45:56.796
and now you exposed.

45:56.897 --> 45:58.866
Your people out there right now

45:58.966 --> 46:00.901
doing dirt on your behalf.

46:01.001 --> 46:02.970
-(laughing)
-(TV playing indistinctly)

46:03.070 --> 46:05.038
Oh, shit.

46:05.138 --> 46:07.374
ANDRE:
Making mistakes.

46:09.877 --> 46:13.213
-(body thuds)
-Mistakes that I'm
going to catch.

46:14.848 --> 46:16.749
Mo matter how small.

46:16.850 --> 46:22.189
And which I will use
to bring you all down

46:22.289 --> 46:26.393
one by one.

46:28.495 --> 46:32.199
-From your friends
to your auntie...
-(crying)

46:34.434 --> 46:36.436
...to your mama.

46:40.407 --> 46:43.076
And then, when there ain't
nobody left...

46:45.445 --> 46:47.780
...I'm going to take you, too.

46:52.953 --> 46:55.688
(door opens)

46:55.788 --> 46:58.025
-(engine starts)
-(door closes)

47:01.361 --> 47:04.064
See you soon, Franklin.

47:04.164 --> 47:06.133
(indistinct chatter nearby)

47:13.606 --> 47:15.142
(groans)

47:25.118 --> 47:27.120

Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

49:25.405 --> 49:27.074
Never get too greedy, Franklin.

49:27.107 --> 49:29.742
The minute you do that,
you lost your advantage.

49:33.846 --> 49:37.117
From here on out,
we'll only deal
with high-level customers.

49:38.685 --> 49:41.121
-You having trust issues?
-No way.

49:43.390 --> 49:46.359
It's up to you
to protect everyone.
Can you do it or not?

49:48.628 --> 49:50.563
How are you sleeping at night?

49:50.597 --> 49:51.931
Like a baby.

49:57.370 --> 49:59.806
-We are not going off on some--
-Wild goose chase.
