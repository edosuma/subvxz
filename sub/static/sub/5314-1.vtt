00:58.058 --> 01:00.647
O'Donnell, save something
for the game.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.814
I'm just warming up, coach.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.482
Just talked to the scout again.
He's coming tonight.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.901
You play half the game
I know you're capable of...

01:08.068 --> 01:10.279
...he's prepared to offer you
a full scholarship.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.490
Free ride to college
and the world's your oyster, kid.

01:14.950 --> 01:15.993
Thanks, coach.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.788
All right, jockstraps,
let's gather up. Picture time.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.248
Try not to break the camera.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.918
We gotta hang on.
Ned's not here yet.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.670
Who cares? He's the water boy.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.173
That doesn't matter,
because he's part of the team.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.842
Sorry I'm late! Sorry I'm late!

01:33.969 --> 01:35.679
But what kind of Dungeon Master
would I be...

01:35.846 --> 01:39.057
...if I left my party in the middle
of a battle with a hippogriff?

01:39.224 --> 01:41.143
Check it out, it's Merlin the Girlin.

01:42.603 --> 01:46.982
Um, Ned, Ned, look, I'm your best friend,
all right, and I'll always have your back.

01:47.149 --> 01:50.068
But there's only so much I can do
when you show up in a dress.

01:50.235 --> 01:53.488
O'Donnell. How about you and
Boy George join us for this picture?

01:53.655 --> 01:55.240
- Yep. Yep.
- Just one sec.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.203
Give the little guy the sign, please.
Here we are.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.038
Nice, guys. Scoot up in back.

02:01.205 --> 02:04.082
Come on, you gotta look pretty
for the ladies, right? Come on.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.377
Yeah. Let's do it. Three, two, one.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.284
Hey, Vanilla Ice.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.287
We got a game here. Let's bring it in.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.624
Man, I had to. I had to.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.376
Oh, man, over there.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.756
Who is that stone-cold fox?

03:34.923 --> 03:38.302
Oh, it's my girlfriend.

03:39.803 --> 03:40.888
Take no prisoners, bro.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.474
- Oh, hey, there's my girl.
- Hey.

03:44.641 --> 03:48.645
I'm glad you're here, Scar. This whole
scout thing has me wicked nervous.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.648
I just feel like my whole future's
riding on this game.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.068
Yeah. Yeah, I know how you feel.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.237
Yeah? Is eveÂ®ything...?
Everything's cool, right?

03:57.404 --> 03:59.656
Oh, yeah.
Everything's totally copacetic.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.408
- Totally?
- Totally.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.160
O'Donnell.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.746
I gotta go. See you.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.172
You okay?

04:16.048 --> 04:17.089
Uh, uh...

04:18.800 --> 04:21.512
- We can talk about it later.
- No. Just tell me.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.430
It's your big night. Go enjoy it.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.433
I can't enjoy it unless you tell me
what's going on.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.852
Okay.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.896
Um...

04:51.834 --> 04:53.001
O'Donnell!

05:13.647 --> 05:15.399
Wake up!

05:15.566 --> 05:16.733
O'Donnell!

05:16.900 --> 05:20.320
What are you doing?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.901
Scar! Scar, hey.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.110
Hey, Scarlet.

06:00.277 --> 06:03.822
- Hey, hey. Hey, what are you doing?
- Mike, what are you doing?

06:03.989 --> 06:06.950
Look, you and me,
we're in this together, okay?

06:07.117 --> 06:10.621
- But the game. That's your future.
- No, the baby's my future.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.956
- That's crazy.
- You're my future.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.210
I can't let you throw this all away.
I won't let you.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.593
Thank you for letting me
stay here, Ned.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.513
Oh, yeah. No problem.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.518
- You good on the Cap'n?
- I'm good on the Captain.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.190
Hey, Mike?

07:20.858 --> 07:24.695
Mike, I can tell you're down,
but trust me on this.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.531
You're looking at Scarlet
kicking you out of the house...

07:27.698 --> 07:31.994
...and the kids wanting nothing to do
with you as a negative, when in fact...

07:35.581 --> 07:38.041
- I guess it's mostly negative, isn't it?
- Well, yeah.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.377
I had no upside for that.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.547
Hey! You're getting that
big promotion today, right?

07:43.714 --> 07:45.382
Yes. Yes, I am.

07:45.549 --> 07:48.218
Today everything turns around for me.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.179
Knock them dead.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.098
I love you!

08:06.904 --> 08:08.405
So anyway...

08:08.572 --> 08:10.574
...the way corporate
wants us to spin it...

08:10.741 --> 08:13.744
...is that maybe, in certain situations...

08:13.994 --> 08:17.372
...a four-hour erection
isn't such a terrible thing.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.584
Okay. Next up:

08:20.751 --> 08:25.005
As most of you know, today I am proud to
be naming our new regional sales manager.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.757
- Here we go.
- You know...

08:27.257 --> 08:32.763
...l've been in the pharmaceutical game
for almost two years now...

08:32.929 --> 08:36.225
...and people always ask me:
"What's it take to be an RSM?"

08:37.100 --> 08:38.101
Leadership.

08:39.852 --> 08:40.938
Courage.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.440
Integrity.

08:44.024 --> 08:48.403
But most importantly,
dedication to this company.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.949
So congratulations. Mike.

08:52.783 --> 08:57.287
Mike, if you could slide to your left so I
can congratulate our new RSM, Wendy!

08:57.454 --> 08:59.581
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.294
Go out there and push some pills,
my peeps.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.921
Good job, baby!

09:06.964 --> 09:08.966
Bye-bye, thanks.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.593
See you at practice. Mmm.

09:13.637 --> 09:17.182
Mike. What's crack-a-lacking, coz?

09:17.349 --> 09:20.602
Well, I'll tell you what's crack-a-lacking.
Are you kidding me?

09:20.894 --> 09:24.481
Wendy's been here two months.
I've been here 16 years.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.316
I got the best numbers on the team.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.819
You should think of it as a compliment.

09:28.986 --> 09:34.074
Think of it as us saying,
"You're just too valuable to promote."

09:35.450 --> 09:36.827
- You little...
- Shh, shh, shh, hello?

09:36.994 --> 09:39.997
Hey, buddy. No, no, no, I got time.

09:40.164 --> 09:44.334
Ha. I know, right?
Look, listen, she was my doubles par...

09:49.214 --> 09:52.926
So many girls and only one promotion,
but you guys are so supportive.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.345
- But, Wendy, you did it.
- Thank you.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.265
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

09:58.432 --> 10:00.767
You guys! OMG.

10:00.934 --> 10:05.022
Oh, and it gets better,
because we are going to T.G.I. Friday's!

10:05.189 --> 10:06.648
- Shut up!
- Aah!

11:13.257 --> 11:15.050
Mike O'Donnell.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.096
Do I know you?

11:19.721 --> 11:21.598
No. But I know you.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.559
Oh, yeah?

11:24.226 --> 11:27.896
High school star.
Never quite lived up to your potential.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.484
Sooner or later you all come back
to the old school.

11:32.651 --> 11:36.113
Stand there and look at the picture
of the glory days...

11:36.280 --> 11:38.615
...wondering what might have been.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.952
Seems to me you guys
are living in the past.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.330
Well, of course I want to live in the past.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.082
It was better there.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.962
I'll bet you wish you had it
to do all over again.

11:52.588 --> 11:55.007
Huh. You got that right.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.136
You're sure about that?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.014
Oh, yeah.

12:03.015 --> 12:05.392
- Dad.
- Hi, Mr. O'Donnell.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.061
- Ladies.
- What are you doing here?

12:08.228 --> 12:10.147
Oh, I was just talking to...

12:11.023 --> 12:12.482
...nobody.

12:13.692 --> 12:17.487
Doesn't matter. I got off work early,
and I thought we could get ice cream.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.032
Together?

12:20.991 --> 12:23.827
- Why?
- Just go get your brother, okay?

12:25.871 --> 12:27.164
Do you need anything else?

12:27.331 --> 12:28.957
No, we're fine.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.506
What's the matter?
This used to be your favorite place.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.675
- We used to come here for your birthday.
- When I was, like, 8.

12:46.141 --> 12:49.186
So, Al, basketball season's coming up.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.395
- You ready?
- Yeah.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.356
- Been working on that outside shot?
- Mm-hm.

12:52.523 --> 12:53.649
- Passing?
- Good.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.442
- Dribbling?
- Really good.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.528
Good's not going to get you
a scholarship.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.364
I meant, it's great.
It's great, Dad. It's great.

13:00.531 --> 13:02.950
That's my boy. Remember,
it's not how big you are.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.159
It's how big you play.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.744
Right up here.

13:06.245 --> 13:08.622
Uh, Maggie got into Georgetown.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.124
Maggie, that's awesome.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.710
Can you turn down the?

13:31.311 --> 13:34.106
Okay, guys, see you soon.

13:35.566 --> 13:40.070
Love you. Nice chatting with you.

13:51.915 --> 13:56.587
What the hell are you doing?

13:58.338 --> 14:00.174
Hey, that's my stuff.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.888
Why are you destroying our yard?

14:06.054 --> 14:08.098
It's not our yard. It's my yard, remember?

14:08.807 --> 14:12.186
You took the road not taken.
And I get the yard.

14:16.607 --> 14:19.026
I'm going to turn it into a showpiece
for my clients.

14:19.193 --> 14:22.404
- Clients of what?
- Landscape design.

14:22.571 --> 14:23.780
Landscape design?

14:23.947 --> 14:26.283
I'm going to show people what I can do.

14:27.367 --> 14:31.455
Yeah, well, the divorce isn't final for
another two weeks, so you have no right.

14:31.622 --> 14:35.792
Really? So I've spent the last 18 years
of my life listening to you whine...

14:35.959 --> 14:39.213
...about the things you could've done
without me, and I have no right?

14:39.379 --> 14:42.591
- It's just I put a lot of work into this yard.
- Did you?

14:42.758 --> 14:45.135
Really? Like the barbeque pit?

14:45.302 --> 14:46.553
Yeah.

14:46.720 --> 14:50.807
Yeah. The way I remember that is that
you spent about an hour working on it...

14:50.974 --> 14:54.770
...and then you spent the next two days
complaining about...

14:54.937 --> 14:57.981
...if you had gone to college,
you could've hired someone to do it.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.401
- I don't think it was a whole two days.
- Or the hammock over here.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.653
Yeah.

15:02.819 --> 15:06.907
I think you quit that one because
you just decided not to try anymore.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.701
Look, try to see things
from my point of view.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.579
I am extremely disappointed with my life.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.498
I never asked you to marry me.

15:14.665 --> 15:15.999
Yeah, but I did.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.046
Well...

15:22.256 --> 15:25.467
...you don't have to do me
any more favors, then.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.095
We're not going to hold each
other back anymore, okay?

15:28.303 --> 15:31.807
- Scar...
- I'll see you at court, okay? At the trial.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.308
Scarlet.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.518
Naomi!

15:34.685 --> 15:36.687
- You came.
- Of course I came.

15:36.854 --> 15:40.232
What bridesmaid would I be if I
didn't hold your hand during the divorce?

15:40.399 --> 15:44.111
Now, just remember.
The first one's always the hardest.

15:44.278 --> 15:45.612
- Mike.
- Naomi.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.155
- Naomi.
- I don't care.

15:47.322 --> 15:50.450
Let's get going. We got to get you ready.
Back on the market.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.827
Yeah, I'm a real catch.

15:51.994 --> 15:56.039
Single mom with two teenage kids
and manure caked under my fingernails.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.667
You'll do great. You got the butt
of a 12-year-old boy.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.128
That's terrific.
I hope our daughter heard that.

16:01.295 --> 16:03.839
Ugh. When was the last time you waxed?

16:08.093 --> 16:09.678
Bye, Mike.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.393
Bye.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.384
You're sure about that?

16:59.728 --> 17:01.271
Jesus.

17:14.242 --> 17:16.411
Hey! Get off of there!

17:31.468 --> 17:33.637
Oh, no. Hello?

17:34.471 --> 17:37.182
Hello?! Hello?!

17:44.606 --> 17:46.316
What the?

17:50.571 --> 17:53.031
Oh, no!

18:39.620 --> 18:41.663
Oh, man.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.169
Ned?

18:47.503 --> 18:48.712
Thief!

18:48.879 --> 18:52.299
No, no, no, Ned!
Ned, no, no, no! It's me!

18:56.970 --> 18:59.431
Stop! Stop!

19:05.062 --> 19:06.438
Ned?

19:09.650 --> 19:12.486
Oh, wow. I feel great.

19:13.904 --> 19:15.072
Ha, ha.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.493
What are you doing? No, Ned.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.746
- Aah! Aah!
- No.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.584
No, no, no, Ned!

19:37.427 --> 19:40.389
Ned! Come on! It's me, it's Mike!

19:45.060 --> 19:48.772
Ned, Ned, Ned, I'm telling you,
I'm telling you, stop it! Stop it! Now!

19:50.148 --> 19:51.441
Oh.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.277
An elegant weapon...

19:53.443 --> 19:55.904
...from a more civilized time.

20:01.285 --> 20:04.371
Hey, it's me! It's Mike O'Donnell,
your best friend!

20:06.123 --> 20:07.958
You have an undescended testicle.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.460
Googleable!

20:10.627 --> 20:11.837
Ned!

20:13.338 --> 20:15.799
You helped me cheat on my math test,
but I got caught.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.051
Public record!

20:26.059 --> 20:28.562
You asked Princess Leia
to junior prom.

20:29.688 --> 20:31.148
Covered by the local news.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.908
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

20:45.162 --> 20:46.163
Please.

20:46.330 --> 20:47.748
- Oh!
- Ha, ha!

20:50.250 --> 20:51.627
Oh, my God.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.922
No, no, no.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.632
Ned, Ned.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.593
Oh, my God.

21:11.313 --> 21:14.316
Would you stop staring at me?

21:15.150 --> 21:17.528
- It's freaking me out.
- It's freaking me out!

21:17.694 --> 21:19.655
I'm pubescent!

21:23.492 --> 21:26.537
Okay. So, uh...

21:26.703 --> 21:28.539
...it's a classic transformation story.

21:28.997 --> 21:31.750
It appears in the literature
time and time again.

21:31.917 --> 21:34.253
Were you at any point shot
by a gamma ray?

21:35.337 --> 21:38.090
- No.
- Exposed to gamma radiation of any kind?

21:38.257 --> 21:40.175
- No, Ned.
- No?

21:40.342 --> 21:42.553
You wouldn't see it. Okay.

21:43.554 --> 21:46.932
That eliminates these and those
and most of that side.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.187
Are you now or have you ever been...

21:53.397 --> 21:56.316
...a Norse god, vampire,
or time-traveling cyborg?

21:56.483 --> 21:59.403
I've known you since, what, first grade?
I would have told you.

21:59.862 --> 22:03.156
Vampire wouldn't tell.
Cyborg wouldn't know.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.825
Shut up.

22:05.409 --> 22:10.080
Okay, if it's not any of those,
I guess, um, we're looking at your basic...

22:11.123 --> 22:14.543
...spirit guide transformation magic.
That's kind of a biggie, actually.

22:15.544 --> 22:17.462
That is here.

22:17.629 --> 22:19.381
When the hero...

22:19.548 --> 22:22.009
- I guess that's... I guess, you.
- Hm.

22:22.176 --> 22:25.929
Uh, is transformed by his spirit guide...

22:26.096 --> 22:27.764
...to set him on a new path.

22:28.223 --> 22:30.601
- Which is what?
- Do I look like your spirit guide?

22:36.523 --> 22:37.858
The janitor.

22:39.610 --> 22:40.944
The janitor.

22:53.165 --> 22:55.459
You guys seen the janitor?
You seen the janitor?

22:55.626 --> 22:58.045
- Do you know where the janitor is?
- No.

22:58.212 --> 23:01.298
Hey, where's the janitor?
Where does the janitor work?

23:01.465 --> 23:03.467
- Excuse me!
- You all right, kid?

23:03.634 --> 23:05.969
- There's another janitor who works here.
- Just me.

23:06.136 --> 23:08.972
No, no. There's an older guy
with white hair who works here.

23:09.139 --> 23:13.769
I was here yesterday talking to the janit...
I showed him this picture of me.

23:13.936 --> 23:16.063
- You?
- Yeah.

23:16.230 --> 23:18.982
That picture's from 1989.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.820
Right. Forget it.

23:28.492 --> 23:31.787
Alex!

23:31.954 --> 23:33.330
Alex, buddy!

23:34.498 --> 23:35.749
Alex!

24:07.906 --> 24:11.994
Hello?

24:14.246 --> 24:16.165
Spirit guide?

24:17.708 --> 24:19.668
What am I supposed to do?

24:19.835 --> 24:22.379
Don't know what I'm supposed to do.

24:29.928 --> 24:32.181
Ouch. Oh, ow.

24:32.347 --> 24:35.267
I got shot. Did I get shot or did I get...?
Someone got powned.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.063
- It's a grenade.
- Ned.

24:40.606 --> 24:42.149
Aah! Oh, sorry. Teenage you.

24:42.316 --> 24:45.194
I figured it out.
I figured out what I'm supposed to do.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.571
I figured out what my spirit guide
wants me to do.

24:47.821 --> 24:48.989
I'm going back.

24:51.492 --> 24:53.410
I'm going back to high school, Ned!

24:53.577 --> 24:56.079
No! No, no. No way.

24:56.246 --> 24:59.082
Your spirit guide would not waste
transformation magic...

24:59.249 --> 25:01.919
...on you reliving your senior year
and going to prom. No.

25:02.085 --> 25:07.007
Ned, this is my chance to have my life over,
but to do it right.

25:07.174 --> 25:09.343
- Wouldn't you, if you had the chance?
- No.

25:09.510 --> 25:12.095
I'm rich, and nobody stuck
my head in a toilet today.

25:12.262 --> 25:14.014
Sure. Besides, it's not just about me.

25:14.181 --> 25:18.268
- It's about you.
- No, it's much bigger than me.

25:18.435 --> 25:20.562
- It's about you.
- Okay, maybe it's about me...

25:20.729 --> 25:22.272
...but what's wrong with that?

25:22.439 --> 25:25.400
I have not done anything
for me since 1989.

25:26.527 --> 25:30.364
You do what you have to do. But don't
think about sucking me into this with you.

25:30.531 --> 25:32.407
Hayden was the low point
of my existence...

25:32.574 --> 25:36.870
...and I vowed I would never go back
to that godforsaken place!

25:37.037 --> 25:40.290
Never, ever, ever!

25:40.791 --> 25:43.710
Never! Never, ever, ever!

25:46.880 --> 25:48.590
I hate you.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.134
Hello.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.304
I'm here to enroll my son...

25:54.680 --> 25:56.431
...in school.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.016
Mark.

25:58.475 --> 26:00.143
What's up?

26:02.354 --> 26:04.690
So...

26:07.651 --> 26:10.487
So we'll just have a seat
till you're ready for us.

26:10.654 --> 26:12.489
We'll be right, uh... Okay.

26:21.498 --> 26:22.666
What's this you're wearing?

26:24.501 --> 26:29.256
This is cool. This is hip. I have a picture
of Kevin Federline wearing the same thing.

26:29.423 --> 26:31.675
- I don't know who that is.
- What are you wearing?

26:31.842 --> 26:33.260
- I told you, like a dad.
- I am.

26:33.427 --> 26:35.596
- You look like Clay Aiken.
- Leave him out of this.

26:38.182 --> 26:42.227
- Are you sure these look legit?
- Oh, yeah. Look who you're talking to.

26:42.394 --> 26:47.191
I'm the guy who invented the software
that prevents people from stealing music.

26:48.025 --> 26:50.485
I also invented the software
that helps people steal music...

26:50.652 --> 26:52.029
...but that's a happy coincidence.

26:53.071 --> 26:55.491
What is that?

26:56.992 --> 26:58.035
Oh, my G...

26:58.202 --> 26:59.953
- Wrong. These are for me.
- You kidding?

27:00.120 --> 27:03.874
- What's-her-name and Chewie's for me.
- Miss Masterson will see you now.

27:04.082 --> 27:05.125
Let's go.

27:06.710 --> 27:08.545
Just don't try to be funny, all right?

27:08.712 --> 27:10.797
Say as little as possible.

27:10.964 --> 27:13.467
Hey, watch where you're going, toolbag.

27:13.634 --> 27:17.095
- So sorry, sir. Our fault.
- Stan.

27:22.059 --> 27:25.687
Hello. I'm Jane Masterson,
principal here at Hayden High.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.397
Hi.

27:39.743 --> 27:42.579
Hello.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.915
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:45.624 --> 27:46.917
Uh, okay.

27:48.085 --> 27:49.878
Yeah, I think we're good here.

27:50.254 --> 27:51.797
Sorry.

27:53.465 --> 27:55.843
I think our hands just made a baby.

27:56.009 --> 28:00.722
Excuse my dad. He's not used to
talking to attractive women.

28:00.889 --> 28:02.516
Oh, thank you...

28:03.267 --> 28:04.560
- Mark.
- Mark...

28:04.726 --> 28:08.397
...for that flattering
yet totally inappropriate comment.

28:08.564 --> 28:09.773
Please sit.

28:11.859 --> 28:15.946
Before we get started, I think you should
know that, uh, Mark's a bastard.

28:17.281 --> 28:18.407
Excuse me?

28:18.574 --> 28:20.576
I had him out of wedlock, so...

28:21.201 --> 28:22.953
...l'm single.

28:23.287 --> 28:24.454
And I'm very rich.

28:27.708 --> 28:29.293
Okay.

28:29.459 --> 28:31.962
- Did you bring your transcripts?
- Oh, yeah.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.214
Transcripts.

28:34.381 --> 28:38.051
Last school you went to was
Cutler High in Connecticut.

28:38.218 --> 28:40.220
Straight-A student. Very impressive.

28:42.097 --> 28:43.140
Math club...

28:43.307 --> 28:45.642
...National Merit finalist...

28:45.809 --> 28:48.896
...Coney Island
Hot Dog Eating Champion.

28:53.984 --> 28:56.987
Well, I think Hayden
would be lucky to have you.

28:57.821 --> 29:00.115
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

29:06.371 --> 29:08.832
Uh, yes, Mr. Gold.
Do you have a question?

29:10.042 --> 29:11.835
Your hair is pretty.

29:12.711 --> 29:16.089
Ah. Not a question, but thank you.

29:17.508 --> 29:19.760
Would the lady mind if I smelled it?

29:19.927 --> 29:23.514
Now is probably a good time to tell you
that I don't date students' parents.

29:24.223 --> 29:29.019
Well, maybe I should tell you that I never
don't not date the principal of my child.

29:29.186 --> 29:31.980
Okay, come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

29:32.147 --> 29:34.233
Let's go.

29:35.192 --> 29:36.985
I was about to close!

29:37.819 --> 29:40.364
You have to do it right now?
Just calm down. You're a dad.

29:40.531 --> 29:44.159
- Hi. Oh, my gosh. We're in.
- You see her undress me with her eyes?

29:44.326 --> 29:46.161
I don't think that's what that was.

29:46.328 --> 29:49.456
Hey. Wow. I don't know how we did it.

29:49.623 --> 29:51.250
It's Maggie's friends. Watch this.

29:51.416 --> 29:53.961
- Hey, girls, how's it going?
- Do I know you?

29:54.127 --> 29:55.420
What'd you do, mug K-Fed?

29:59.716 --> 30:02.386
Welcome to the bottom
of the food chain.

30:04.555 --> 30:07.975
Hey, look, you always had
my back in high school, okay?

30:08.141 --> 30:10.894
So if your spirit guide
wants you to be a fake teenager...

30:11.061 --> 30:13.021
...and me to be your fake dad...

30:13.188 --> 30:16.358
...the least I can do is make sure
that my fake son doesn't look...

30:17.234 --> 30:19.027
...like a total douche.

30:19.486 --> 30:22.239
- I don't look like a douche.
- What a douche.

30:22.614 --> 30:24.449
We're going shopping.

30:24.616 --> 30:27.244
- Really?
- Yes, your shirt is bedazzled.

30:27.828 --> 30:29.746
Bedazzled with rhinestones.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.101
Ooh.

30:51.268 --> 30:53.103
Let's go to school.

30:53.270 --> 30:54.438
Hey, yo, check it out.

30:54.605 --> 30:56.106
That's just rude.

31:38.315 --> 31:40.192
What's up, dude?

31:45.989 --> 31:47.699
What are you looking at, punk?

31:49.159 --> 31:51.161
- Watch it.
- Wake up, douche.

31:53.914 --> 31:55.749
Sorry.

31:58.335 --> 32:01.171
No phones, no texting.

32:02.923 --> 32:05.592
Settle, people. Settle down.

32:05.759 --> 32:08.428
Take the roughhousing outside, class.

32:13.225 --> 32:14.643
Hello?

32:15.477 --> 32:17.938
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you?

32:19.815 --> 32:21.525
Oh, cr...

32:21.692 --> 32:24.695
- The thing.
- You mean our divorce?

32:24.862 --> 32:26.613
Do you take any of this seriously?

32:26.780 --> 32:29.825
No, no! Yes, I take this seriously.

32:29.992 --> 32:33.620
I had to leave the country
very suddenly, uh...

32:33.787 --> 32:36.540
...with the Mayan... Inca,
I'm with the Incas in Peru.

32:36.707 --> 32:38.667
We think we might have found the next...

32:40.002 --> 32:41.044
...Rogaine.

32:43.005 --> 32:44.381
Are you with a girl?

32:44.548 --> 32:47.384
No, no. It's, uh, a bunch of cheerleaders.

32:47.551 --> 32:51.013
So would you consider
maybe dating a 10th-grader?

32:51.180 --> 32:53.056
I think we could go for full custody.

32:53.223 --> 32:55.309
No, you can't take my kids
away from me.

32:55.475 --> 32:57.561
Since when do you care?

33:02.274 --> 33:03.317
Look...

33:05.235 --> 33:07.696
...l'm a lot closer to them than you think.

33:07.863 --> 33:10.240
Let's reschedule, okay?

33:12.743 --> 33:14.286
Hey, Maggie.

33:17.539 --> 33:20.083
Um, why is the new kid waving at me?

33:20.250 --> 33:22.002
I don't know.

33:22.169 --> 33:24.171
But if that boy were an apple...

33:24.338 --> 33:25.797
...he'd be a Delicious.

33:26.590 --> 33:28.091
Oh, God.

33:32.179 --> 33:35.516
Gosh, we are all in such great shape.

33:35.682 --> 33:37.267
Oh, jeez.

33:37.434 --> 33:40.521
Man, you know, I will tell you something.

33:40.687 --> 33:43.607
In 10 years you're going
to have this thing right here...

33:43.774 --> 33:48.403
...that no amount of crunches will
get rid of. And spot reduction, total lie.

33:48.570 --> 33:50.447
You know, l...

33:51.532 --> 33:53.575
Never mind. Give me the ball.

33:54.451 --> 33:55.786
Fakes right, goes left.

33:55.953 --> 33:57.913
And signature move.

33:59.414 --> 34:00.791
Kid.

34:04.211 --> 34:06.922
- I'm Coach Murphy.
- Oh, wow.

34:07.089 --> 34:09.632
- You're still here?
- What?

34:10.801 --> 34:12.094
You're a legend.

34:12.261 --> 34:15.514
Yeah. Well, yeah. Twenty years.

34:15.681 --> 34:18.183
It's actually my last one.

34:18.350 --> 34:21.103
Good hops, kid. Nice handle.

34:21.645 --> 34:23.230
We're looking for a point guard.

34:23.647 --> 34:24.815
Oh, yeah?

34:26.525 --> 34:30.154
- Why don't you come to tryouts?
- Okay.

34:31.029 --> 34:33.574
- I'm done talking to you.
- Yeah, yeah.

34:36.534 --> 34:37.619
Hey, how's it going?

34:37.786 --> 34:38.829
Things are looking up.

34:38.996 --> 34:41.831
Coach Murphy practically
put me on the team.

34:41.998 --> 34:44.585
That's not a coincidence.
We're on the path.

34:44.751 --> 34:48.005
That's great. That's super you're finding
your destiny and, blah, blah, whatever.

34:48.172 --> 34:50.591
Here's something.
I need you to do something for me.

34:50.757 --> 34:52.342
I need you to get in trouble.

34:52.509 --> 34:53.969
Not, like, big trouble.

34:54.136 --> 34:57.806
Just enough trouble so that the principal
needs to meet with your father.

34:57.973 --> 34:59.600
Yeah, okay, well, we'll see.

34:59.766 --> 35:01.810
- Oh! Boom.
- Ned!

35:01.977 --> 35:03.103
Boom. Checkmate, Samir!

35:03.270 --> 35:05.105
- Damn it!
- Checkmate.

35:05.814 --> 35:08.609
Uh, can I get a little help in here?

35:11.487 --> 35:12.613
Alex?

35:19.495 --> 35:20.871
How does it...?

35:22.456 --> 35:25.167
- Who did this to you?
- The basketball team.

35:26.335 --> 35:29.713
But why? Why? You're one of them.

35:30.088 --> 35:31.131
You're popular.

35:31.798 --> 35:35.969
Uh, look, this is kind of personal,
and I don't know you.

35:36.136 --> 35:37.346
- I'm taped to the toilet.
- Yeah.

35:37.513 --> 35:42.059
I'm sorry, I'm Mark Gold, uh,
your uncle Ned's kid. I just started here.

35:42.226 --> 35:44.311
Oh, cool. Cool, yeah.

35:44.478 --> 35:46.688
Well, I'd shake your hand...

35:46.855 --> 35:48.982
...but it's taped to my ass.
- Right. Right.

35:49.149 --> 35:50.359
Would you mind?

35:50.526 --> 35:53.237
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Yeah, um.

35:53.403 --> 35:55.572
- Just rip.
- I'm going to get it.

35:56.573 --> 35:57.866
- Band-Aid.
- Go for it.

36:02.204 --> 36:03.914
So how come we never met?

36:05.916 --> 36:08.919
My mom didn't want anyone to know
she had a kid with Ned.

36:09.586 --> 36:11.171
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

36:11.421 --> 36:14.258
So since we're practically
family and all...

36:14.424 --> 36:17.928
...my dad says we should just
keep an eye on each other, you know?

36:18.095 --> 36:19.555
Uh, yeah. Why not?

36:19.721 --> 36:22.766
Next time you could get there
before they tape me to the toilet.

36:22.933 --> 36:24.476
You got it.

36:26.562 --> 36:28.397
This looks good.

36:34.111 --> 36:35.487
Who's that?

36:35.737 --> 36:36.947
Oh, uh...

36:37.114 --> 36:38.782
- Nicole.
- Are you two going out?

36:38.949 --> 36:41.493
No, no, she's the, uh, head cheerleader.

36:41.952 --> 36:43.453
She'd never go out with me.

36:43.620 --> 36:46.456
You know, when I first met
your mother, I was so nervous...

36:46.623 --> 36:48.125
You met my mother?

36:48.292 --> 36:49.543
- What?
- My mother.

36:49.710 --> 36:52.421
You said, "The first time I met
your mother, I was nervous."

36:52.796 --> 36:55.716
- Oh, that's weird. Is your mom hot?
- Dude, what...?

36:55.883 --> 36:59.803
- What do I say to that?
- I was joking. Joking, dude.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.975
Stan.

37:07.644 --> 37:09.146
I hate that guy.

37:09.771 --> 37:11.982
- Oh.
- Thanks.

37:12.149 --> 37:13.192
- What?
- Huh.

37:13.358 --> 37:15.527
- Freshman.
- Good sandwich.

37:16.904 --> 37:19.156
Is that the guy
who taped you to the toilet?

37:19.323 --> 37:20.532
Yeah.

37:20.699 --> 37:23.744
Yesterday he shoved me in a
washing machine in my own house.

37:23.911 --> 37:27.331
- What was that jerk doing at your house?
- It's Maggie's boyfriend.

37:28.832 --> 37:30.667
Maggie has a boyfriend?

37:33.045 --> 37:34.505
Well...

37:35.214 --> 37:37.508
...l'm very disappointed in your sister.

37:38.675 --> 37:41.929
He's looking. Don't make eye contact.
He's kind of temperamental.

37:42.596 --> 37:45.349
- You're looking. Stop it, stop it.
- I'll look at him.

37:45.516 --> 37:47.392
Hey, twinkle douche.

37:48.685 --> 37:53.273
If I wanted you in the cafeteria,
I would've taped you to a lunch lady.

37:54.024 --> 37:56.276
You little punk.

37:56.443 --> 37:58.695
You don't talk to him that way.

38:01.657 --> 38:02.991
Yeah?

38:04.743 --> 38:05.869
What are you gonna do?

38:10.874 --> 38:12.000
What am I gonna do?

38:14.419 --> 38:15.671
First...

38:17.130 --> 38:18.674
...l'm going to call your father.

38:22.261 --> 38:23.804
Heads up!

38:32.354 --> 38:35.232
Give me my ball back, bitch.

38:35.399 --> 38:37.734
You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.904
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

38:41.071 --> 38:42.739
All too well.

38:43.574 --> 38:44.783
You're the man.

38:44.950 --> 38:47.077
Captain of the basketball team.

38:47.244 --> 38:49.496
Dates the pretty girls.

38:50.539 --> 38:52.833
High school is your kingdom.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.711
But, people...

38:55.878 --> 38:57.963
...Stan's a bully.

38:58.130 --> 38:59.590
Why?

38:59.756 --> 39:05.721
It'd be way too easy to say Stan preys
on the weak simply because he's a dick.

39:05.888 --> 39:07.097
No.

39:07.264 --> 39:09.433
No, no.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.268
Stan here...

39:12.019 --> 39:14.271
...is much more complex than that.

39:14.730 --> 39:17.441
See, according to leading psychiatrists...

39:17.608 --> 39:20.903
...Stan's a bully for one of three reasons.

39:21.612 --> 39:23.030
One:

39:23.822 --> 39:25.741
Underneath all of that male bravado...

39:25.908 --> 39:29.786
...there's an insecure little girl banging
on the closet door trying to get out.

39:32.956 --> 39:34.458
Two:

39:34.625 --> 39:36.376
Like a caveman...

39:36.543 --> 39:38.712
...Stan's brain is...

39:38.879 --> 39:41.256
...underdeveloped.

39:41.423 --> 39:44.468
Therefore, Stan is unable
to use self-control.

39:44.635 --> 39:46.803
And so he acts out aggressively.

39:48.013 --> 39:49.973
And the third reason:

39:50.849 --> 39:52.434
Stan has a small wiener.

40:12.037 --> 40:14.039
Don't hurt yourself, big boy.

40:24.007 --> 40:26.927
Whoa, whoa, hey. Drinking age is still 21,
thank you very much.

40:27.094 --> 40:30.931
Unless your spirit guide gave you
a fake ID, this is mine.

40:35.435 --> 40:36.478
What are you eating?

40:36.645 --> 40:39.398
I don't even know.
I just know I'm hungry.

40:39.565 --> 40:41.024
All the time.

40:41.191 --> 40:42.901
Okay, that's not safe or sanitary.

40:43.068 --> 40:45.821
That's your can now.
We'll label it like that.

40:49.032 --> 40:51.201
So, what did you learn at school today?

40:53.328 --> 40:56.206
- That I'm a bad dad.
- I thought it was going great.

40:56.373 --> 40:59.209
It was going fantastic for me.

40:59.376 --> 41:00.794
And then what?

41:03.088 --> 41:07.176
And then I found out my son spent the
last year being the school punching bag...

41:07.342 --> 41:11.096
...and watched my daughter get a
tongue bath from a psychopathic jackass.

41:11.513 --> 41:13.140
High school's delightful, isn't it?

41:13.307 --> 41:16.685
Yeah. But I think I was wrong
about my spirit path.

41:16.852 --> 41:18.979
And who was right? See? I told you.

41:19.146 --> 41:21.148
I told you high school
was the wrong thing.

41:21.315 --> 41:25.027
High school was right,
but it's not about basketball.

41:25.194 --> 41:27.738
It's about helping Alex and Maggie.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.283
Mmm.

41:32.618 --> 41:34.495
All right. I'm getting out of here.

41:35.370 --> 41:37.748
- Disgusting.
- My kids need their father.

41:44.588 --> 41:47.257
- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, Mark.

41:50.427 --> 41:51.595
What was that?

41:52.930 --> 41:54.515
A three-pointer.

41:56.391 --> 41:58.393
Can you do that twice in a row?

42:02.272 --> 42:05.859
Okay. Let's see you do it
with a little pressure.

42:12.866 --> 42:15.410
Wow, you're great.
You should be on the team.

42:17.037 --> 42:20.749
You should be on the team.
I'm going to get you on the team.

42:22.334 --> 42:24.753
That's it. That'll solve everything.

42:25.087 --> 42:27.130
Dude, what are you talking about?

42:27.297 --> 42:28.632
Nothing.

42:35.305 --> 42:39.726
Well, that was fun. I haven't been to
happy hour in, like, a week and a half.

42:39.893 --> 42:43.063
Naomi, thank you so much.
That is exactly what I needed.

42:43.230 --> 42:44.773
Oh, great.

42:44.940 --> 42:47.484
- Mike who?
- Mike who? I've never heard of the guy.

42:47.651 --> 42:48.944
Ow.

42:49.987 --> 42:52.906
Hey, Mom, this is Mark,
Uncle Ned's bastard.

42:53.323 --> 42:54.366
Wow.

42:54.533 --> 42:57.661
I know. Someone had a kid
with Uncle Ned. Ew.

42:59.246 --> 43:01.331
You okay, Mrs. O'Donnell?

43:02.124 --> 43:03.167
Yeah, I'm fine.

43:03.333 --> 43:06.211
It's "Ms.," kid. It's "Ms.," Scarlet.
Don't forget that.

43:06.378 --> 43:07.629
Oh, right.

43:07.963 --> 43:13.260
Wow.

43:14.553 --> 43:18.265
You look just like my husband.
Doesn't he?

43:18.432 --> 43:21.727
- My ex-husband. That is so weird.
- Heh, heh.

43:21.894 --> 43:23.020
It is weird.

43:23.187 --> 43:24.855
What is that?

43:25.022 --> 43:26.481
Scarlet, I need you to come.

43:26.648 --> 43:27.858
Weird.

43:28.025 --> 43:29.526
- Do you see that?
- I did see it.

43:30.569 --> 43:32.029
- You see him?
- She's nice.

43:32.404 --> 43:33.447
But look at him.

43:33.614 --> 43:36.783
You gotta let that guy go,
just out of your brain and move on.

43:36.950 --> 43:39.953
I know you need to grieve
a relationship. It's only natural.

43:40.120 --> 43:41.371
Okay.

43:41.538 --> 43:44.124
You wait here.
I'm going to go smell him.

43:44.291 --> 43:47.628
No, no, no. Sweetie.
You're not allowed to smell teenagers.

43:47.794 --> 43:51.048
Sweetie, you need to hear me on this.
Here's the thing.

43:51.215 --> 43:53.091
The other thing,
you need to acknowledge...

43:53.258 --> 43:56.553
...that he looks exactly like Mike
used to look in high school.

43:56.720 --> 44:00.474
We discussed that. I have looked at him.
But, honey, this is the thing:

44:00.641 --> 44:02.726
You need to hook up with someone new.

44:02.893 --> 44:07.731
Yeah, I deserve to have somebody
smile at me and tell me I'm pretty.

44:07.898 --> 44:09.566
- You do.
- Even if it is...

44:09.733 --> 44:12.152
...to just get me to go home with him.

44:12.319 --> 44:17.199
Or lunch. But, yes, we're gonna
find you a new playmate. Ow!

44:17.366 --> 44:19.827
You little turd. You little snot.

44:19.993 --> 44:21.495
My bad. Gosh, I'm so sorry.

44:21.662 --> 44:25.749
I guess I was, uh, kind of distracted,
as I imagine Alex was...

44:25.916 --> 44:29.211
...at hearing about how his mother,
who is still married, by the way...

44:29.378 --> 44:31.880
...is planning to run around
with every guy she can get.

44:32.047 --> 44:35.843
In Afghanistan, she'd be dragged through
the streets by goats with her hands cut off.

44:36.009 --> 44:37.928
I'm just saying. I'm just saying, Naomi.

44:38.095 --> 44:40.389
- Naomi.
- I don't care.

44:55.779 --> 44:57.656
- Hey, guys.
- Oh.

44:58.073 --> 44:59.783
Okay, settle down. Take your seats.

44:59.950 --> 45:03.620
Thank you, thank you. Thank you, Stan.
Thank you.

45:04.037 --> 45:09.459
Okay, today we will be continuing
our discussion on human sexuality.

45:09.626 --> 45:14.590
And as we discussed,
the official school policy is abstinence.

45:14.756 --> 45:16.466
Now, that is very sensible.

45:16.633 --> 45:19.595
I'm glad that someone here
has their head screwed on straight.

45:19.761 --> 45:23.390
I think all of us should make a pact
to abstain from sex.

45:23.557 --> 45:25.809
Now, who's with me, you guys?
Come on.

45:27.144 --> 45:28.228
Oh, my God.

45:30.981 --> 45:32.900
- Maggie?
- Hm?

45:33.692 --> 45:35.277
However, let's get real.

45:35.444 --> 45:38.739
I know asking high school seniors
to be abstinent...

45:38.906 --> 45:42.826
...is like asking a porcupine
to poop goat cheese. Yuck.

45:43.202 --> 45:47.498
So since the majority of you are or will
become sexually active at some point...

45:47.664 --> 45:52.461
But that point should be way,
way in the future, right?

45:52.628 --> 45:55.130
Well, the official school position...

45:55.297 --> 45:57.508
...is that we prepare you
for safe sex now.

45:58.884 --> 46:01.678
So please take one and pass it down.

46:07.518 --> 46:09.353
I have needs.

46:11.021 --> 46:14.775
- You don't need these.
- Stan, give one to Mark.

46:14.942 --> 46:19.112
No. No, you know what, he's right.
He's right. I don't need one.

46:19.279 --> 46:23.033
You know why I don't need one?
Because there's no one I'm in love with.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.244
It's called "making love," isn't it?

46:25.410 --> 46:30.791
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I think that
means you do it with someone you love.

46:31.041 --> 46:33.377
And preferably when you're married.

46:33.544 --> 46:38.298
You know, when you're ready to take
that love and turn it into a baby.

46:39.591 --> 46:41.760
Because that's what love is.

46:41.927 --> 46:45.055
It's that first moment
when you hold your baby girl...

46:45.848 --> 46:50.894
...and you didn't know that anything
could be so small or so delicate.

46:51.061 --> 46:53.981
And you feel that tiny heart beat...

46:54.565 --> 46:58.694
...and you know that you couldn't love
anything more in the whole world.

47:00.070 --> 47:03.240
And you hope that you can do right
by that little girl...

47:04.116 --> 47:08.162
...and always be there to catch her when
she falls, and that nothing ever hurts her.

47:08.328 --> 47:10.873
Not a broken arm...

47:11.790 --> 47:13.250
...or a bad dream...

47:16.003 --> 47:17.754
...or a broken heart.

47:24.094 --> 47:26.346
- I don't want these. Just take them.
- Me either.

47:26.513 --> 47:27.890
Are you serious?

47:28.348 --> 47:30.809
Great, fine, wonderful.

47:30.976 --> 47:32.686
More for me.

47:33.187 --> 47:35.772
Now I got enough
for the whole weekend.

47:38.984 --> 47:40.027
Oh, my God!

47:41.778 --> 47:43.989
- Stan!
- Boys, stop it!

47:44.239 --> 47:45.908
Break it up! Get off him, Stan!

47:48.076 --> 47:49.703
Put those phones away! Stop it!

47:50.621 --> 47:52.372
- Stop hitting him!
- No fighting!

47:53.790 --> 47:56.376
- You like that?
- You're gonna go to jail again.

48:00.631 --> 48:02.633
Look at that.
He slapped him like a mother.

48:02.799 --> 48:04.259
That thing sucks.

48:05.969 --> 48:08.305
- Oh!
- Oh, that's wrong.

48:09.640 --> 48:12.017
Yo, check this out.
My cousin in New York sent it to me.

48:22.861 --> 48:25.531
I hope I'm not late for our meeting.

48:25.697 --> 48:28.826
Busted for fighting, nice. Who won?

48:28.992 --> 48:31.995
You know, it was actually pretty even.

48:32.454 --> 48:33.664
Really?

48:33.831 --> 48:36.166
On YouTube it looked like
you got your ass kicked.

48:36.333 --> 48:38.210
I saw it a couple times.

48:39.169 --> 48:41.046
- What are you wearing?
- Hm?

48:41.505 --> 48:43.549
- Beckham.
- No, what?

48:43.715 --> 48:45.259
Oh, the clothes. Oh, right.

48:45.425 --> 48:47.761
To the untrained eye,
I look like a total idiot.

48:47.928 --> 48:49.263
You do, in fact.

48:49.429 --> 48:53.934
Ah. But it's actually a seduction
technique known as "peacocking."

48:54.101 --> 48:58.355
My outfit serves the dual function
of icebreaker and attention-getter.

48:59.982 --> 49:01.275
You can go in now.

49:01.859 --> 49:03.360
Watch.

49:10.200 --> 49:11.535
Are you peacocking?

49:12.494 --> 49:14.371
Really? You think that's gonna work?

49:14.538 --> 49:15.998
I think it just might.

49:25.716 --> 49:29.761
Is that? Mrs. O'Donnell!
How you doing?

49:29.928 --> 49:31.096
Hello, how are you?

49:31.263 --> 49:32.681
I'm good. How are you?

49:32.848 --> 49:34.433
Good.

49:35.642 --> 49:38.270
Wow. This is gonna take
some getting used to.

49:39.062 --> 49:40.189
You're Ned's son?

49:40.355 --> 49:42.608
Yeah. Yeah. Ned gave birth to me.

49:42.774 --> 49:45.569
Well, he didn't give birth...
You know what I meant.

49:47.112 --> 49:49.406
You're doing some gardening.

49:49.573 --> 49:52.034
- I'm redoing the backyard.
- Oh.

49:52.242 --> 49:53.327
You want to see?

49:53.494 --> 49:56.330
Yeah, sure. I got some time.

49:58.957 --> 50:00.250
Oh, wow.

50:00.417 --> 50:04.755
Yeah. Obviously, I still have a lot to do.

50:04.922 --> 50:07.049
- You can put that...
- Right here?

50:07.216 --> 50:08.509
All right.

50:09.259 --> 50:10.844
Thank you.

50:11.053 --> 50:13.013
- So this is it.
- This is it.

50:13.180 --> 50:14.598
It used to look a lot worse.

50:16.099 --> 50:17.643
Mm-mm.

50:18.268 --> 50:23.357
Basically, uh, what I planned to do was
to put a pond in over here...

50:23.524 --> 50:26.068
- Okay.
...and have water...

50:26.235 --> 50:28.821
...streaming in from both sides.

50:29.446 --> 50:33.075
And then put a big deck right here...

50:33.242 --> 50:38.956
...and then a flagstone patio there
with sod in between.

50:39.122 --> 50:40.541
That would be pretty.

50:40.707 --> 50:45.963
And then to have twinkling lights
above the whole thing...

50:46.129 --> 50:48.632
...so that every night is a starry one.

50:48.799 --> 50:50.133
Heh.

50:50.300 --> 50:52.636
It's gonna be amazing, Scar.

50:52.803 --> 50:54.054
What did you just call me?

50:54.805 --> 50:56.056
Uh...

50:56.223 --> 50:58.809
- I just said, "lt'll be amazing."
- You called me "Scar."

50:59.643 --> 51:01.687
My husband's the only one
who calls me that.

51:01.854 --> 51:03.397
Could you use some help?

51:04.565 --> 51:07.401
Volunteer. I'm young, I'm strong.

51:07.568 --> 51:09.194
Oh. Oh.

51:09.361 --> 51:11.488
Right, got it. Okay.

51:14.032 --> 51:17.578
I realize that whole
lady cougar hunting...

51:17.744 --> 51:22.166
...the "mothers I'd like to,"
you know, whatever, thing...

51:22.332 --> 51:25.669
...is big with you guys, right?
With you high school boys?

51:25.836 --> 51:28.422
But that's not gonna happen
between me and you.

51:28.589 --> 51:30.966
I didn't even mean it that way.

51:31.133 --> 51:36.180
I was thinking more along the lines of
business experience, college application.

51:36.346 --> 51:38.807
But if you want to go there, that's...

51:38.974 --> 51:40.976
- So I'll just get you a shovel, then?
- Yeah.

51:41.143 --> 51:42.352
Okay.

52:30.776 --> 52:31.819
What?

53:09.356 --> 53:13.443
- I said we could do it!
- Called it.

53:13.610 --> 53:15.737
Did you see the look on Stan's face?

53:15.904 --> 53:21.243
Alex? What happened at the tryouts?
How'd it go?

53:21.451 --> 53:25.539
It was good. Mark had a great tryout.
He played great.

53:25.706 --> 53:28.208
- Yeah.
- And so did I. I made the team.

53:28.375 --> 53:31.211
Really? Oh, great! That's so good.
I'm so proud of you.

53:31.378 --> 53:32.629
Me too.

53:32.796 --> 53:34.298
He did great out there.

53:34.464 --> 53:36.383
Oh, Mark. That's super inappropriate.

53:36.550 --> 53:38.468
L... Good job today.

53:38.635 --> 53:39.928
- Good job!
- Thanks.

53:40.095 --> 53:43.265
I want to show you something.
Come here. I wanna show you guys.

53:45.976 --> 53:48.312
Ta-da.

53:49.563 --> 53:51.732
- You hung the lights.
- Yes.

53:52.191 --> 53:53.817
- Wow.
- Wow.

53:53.984 --> 53:56.236
I wanted you guys to be the first to see.

53:56.403 --> 53:58.071
- Mom, it's sick.
- Really?

53:58.238 --> 54:00.240
It's so good.

54:00.699 --> 54:02.701
Oh, my gosh.

54:04.703 --> 54:07.498
Mark. Mark, we should go practice, dude.

54:07.664 --> 54:10.250
The game's on Friday.
Mom, such a good job.

54:15.422 --> 54:16.924
What do you think?

54:17.090 --> 54:18.467
It's amazing.

54:18.634 --> 54:23.347
When people see how talented you are,
you'll be designing gardens all over the city.

54:23.514 --> 54:24.848
Really?

54:25.015 --> 54:26.683
Well, thank you, Mark. That's nice.

54:31.313 --> 54:32.356
Oh.

54:32.523 --> 54:37.027
- I have to go. I have a date tonight.
- You have a...? You have a date?

54:37.194 --> 54:40.823
I'm going dancing, which is ridiculous
because I'm a terrible dancer.

54:41.448 --> 54:44.326
- You're an amazing dancer.
- What?

54:45.577 --> 54:47.371
- Hm? Ahem.
- Wh...?

54:47.538 --> 54:49.289
You just look like you can move.

54:49.456 --> 54:51.208
Um, okay.

54:51.375 --> 54:54.878
I'm going to go, so have fun, Mark.

54:55.045 --> 54:56.547
Night.

55:13.355 --> 55:15.941
- What are you looking at?
- That was great.

55:16.733 --> 55:18.735
That is The Snake.

55:19.403 --> 55:21.488
That was a very hot dance
when you were 1.

55:22.906 --> 55:24.825
- Teach it to me.
- I can't.

55:24.992 --> 55:27.119
It's a very advanced step...

55:27.286 --> 55:30.831
...which I know is hard to believe
because I make it look effortless.

55:31.748 --> 55:33.667
That's the secret to all great dancers.

55:34.626 --> 55:36.211
Try me.

55:39.214 --> 55:41.216
Why did you pick that song?

55:41.383 --> 55:44.845
Oh, I don't know.
It just, uh, kind of spoke to me.

55:45.012 --> 55:47.014
Hm. That's funny.

55:47.181 --> 55:50.100
That's the song that my husband
and I danced to at our wedding.

55:50.267 --> 55:52.394
Hm. A man of good taste.

55:52.561 --> 55:54.646
- Want me to show you some dance moves?
- I'd love to.

55:54.813 --> 55:56.106
That I learned at my wedding.

55:56.273 --> 56:00.652
- Great.
- Yeah. Okay, you stand here, like that.

56:00.819 --> 56:03.280
Okay, like that, and I'll stand here.

56:03.447 --> 56:06.450
- No, you stand right there.
- Right there.

56:06.617 --> 56:10.996
Okay, ready? So you go
right foot back and then left foot back.

56:11.497 --> 56:15.125
And then quick
right, left, right, left, right.

56:15.292 --> 56:17.961
And then right... Oh.

56:18.128 --> 56:21.048
That was good.
And left, right, left, right.

56:21.882 --> 56:23.091
That's good.

56:23.258 --> 56:26.220
That was really good.
You're picking that up pretty quickly.

56:26.386 --> 56:28.347
- So you mentioned your husband.
- Mm-hm.

56:28.514 --> 56:30.807
Do you think you guys are ever
going to get back together?

56:30.974 --> 56:33.143
Um, no.

56:34.019 --> 56:35.646
Why are you so sure?

56:35.813 --> 56:39.024
Maybe there's something he could do
to fix things.

56:39.191 --> 56:42.361
I love my husband and care about him...

56:44.404 --> 56:46.573
...but sometimes that just is not enough.

56:48.700 --> 56:50.744
Well, he blew it.

56:50.911 --> 56:52.287
Jump.

57:08.136 --> 57:09.680
- Mom?
- Yeah.

57:12.558 --> 57:13.600
Hey, Alex.

57:15.060 --> 57:17.646
- Mom?
- I'm your mom.

57:17.813 --> 57:19.815
I am Alex's mom, Mark.

57:19.982 --> 57:21.275
Yeah.

57:22.109 --> 57:24.695
- Your date is here.
- Huh?

57:25.529 --> 57:27.364
- The front door. Your date.
- Okay.

57:27.698 --> 57:29.867
She was nervous. It's creepy, right?

57:30.033 --> 57:31.618
Little bit.

57:31.785 --> 57:34.037
She's so old, it's like...

57:35.205 --> 57:36.874
Dance with all your friend's moms?

57:37.040 --> 57:38.375
Pretty much.

57:39.126 --> 57:40.627
- Oh, hi, Scarlet.
- Hello.

57:40.794 --> 57:43.297
- Wow, you look amazing. Here. Pour vous.
- Oh, thank you.

57:43.463 --> 57:46.049
Carnations. What a douche bag.

57:46.216 --> 57:47.467
Mark.

57:47.634 --> 57:49.553
- No, that's okay.
- I'm sorry.

57:49.720 --> 57:50.762
I'm a single dad.

57:50.929 --> 57:54.558
It's totally normal for sons to
feel weird when their moms date.

57:54.725 --> 57:58.020
I mean, he's stepping into
Dad's shoes, protecting the castle.

57:58.187 --> 58:00.230
- He's not my son, but...
- Oh.

58:00.898 --> 58:02.274
Then that's weird.

58:02.441 --> 58:03.692
- It is.
- Yeah.

58:03.859 --> 58:05.819
- Uh, do you want to go?
- Yeah.

58:06.278 --> 58:07.404
Let me get my coat.

58:07.571 --> 58:09.406
- Oh, come on.
- Hold these, please.

58:09.573 --> 58:10.908
- This guy?
- You're being rude.

58:11.074 --> 58:12.910
- You're going from Uncle Mike to this guy?
- Shh.

58:13.076 --> 58:15.496
- Be quiet.
- Okay.

58:15.662 --> 58:18.499
- Do me a favor. Shh.
- He's a tool.

58:18.665 --> 58:22.336
Give this to Ned, okay, to give to Mike.
It's our divorce papers.

58:22.503 --> 58:25.756
And remind him that he needs
to be there on the 27th.

58:25.923 --> 58:28.258
Okay? Thank you.

58:53.492 --> 58:54.660
Where are you going?

58:54.827 --> 58:56.620
Jamie's party.

58:59.790 --> 59:01.416
Alex!

59:04.253 --> 59:07.130
Yeah, uh, seriously, I can't be here.
I really can't be here.

59:07.297 --> 59:10.759
Do you know how many dangerous and
hurtful things Stan could do to me here?

59:10.926 --> 59:13.804
You had your head shoved in a
ball return? It's not a massage.

59:13.971 --> 59:16.723
You're on the basketball team now.
Okay? This is your party.

59:17.432 --> 59:19.059
Okay, okay, there she is.

59:19.226 --> 59:20.602
There's Nicole. Oh, God.

59:20.769 --> 59:22.437
- Which one?
- She's right there.

59:22.604 --> 59:24.439
You're looking at... She's my 3, your 2.

59:24.606 --> 59:26.608
- Stop it. You're looking right at her.
- Calm down.

59:28.152 --> 59:29.653
- Sorry.
- What was that?

59:29.820 --> 59:31.989
- Nothing, it was a burp.
- Why are you burping?

59:32.156 --> 59:34.658
- I have tummy issues. What? Get over it.
- Tummy issues?

59:35.033 --> 59:36.910
She's not going to like me. I'm a loser.

59:37.077 --> 59:40.122
Why are you a loser?
Because Stan says you're a loser?

59:40.289 --> 59:43.167
Do you think Stan's a winner?
Stan's going nowhere.

59:43.542 --> 59:46.753
Any girl in here would be lucky
to have your attention.

59:46.920 --> 59:50.340
- What do you know about girls?
- What do I know about girls?

59:51.133 --> 59:53.468
I used to date the
most beautiful girl in school...

59:53.635 --> 59:55.554
...and I let her slip through my fingers.

59:56.013 --> 59:57.681
But I won't let that happen to you.

59:58.182 --> 59:59.433
You're absolutely right.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.269
I'm just going to walk up to her
and introduce myself.

01:00:02.936 --> 01:00:05.689
Tomorrow at school. Maybe.
Probably not.

01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:07.399
Just go.

01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:13.947
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, you came.

01:00:14.114 --> 01:00:15.282
- How are you?
- Good.

01:00:15.449 --> 01:00:18.035
Thank you, um. Have you seen Maggie?
I've been looking everywhere.

01:00:18.202 --> 01:00:20.704
Oh, um, Maggie's not here.

01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:22.706
But, um, I am.

01:00:22.873 --> 01:00:25.501
And I'm really, really glad you came.

01:00:26.877 --> 01:00:29.838
- It's her birthday.
- I didn't get you a present, I'm sorry.

01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:32.841
- I'll just have to unwrap you.
- Heh, heh. Okay.

01:00:34.051 --> 01:00:38.639
I was kicked off the cheerleading squad
for being too flexible.

01:00:42.267 --> 01:00:46.188
Okay, okay. Sit down. Just sit down.

01:00:48.482 --> 01:00:51.401
If you girls don't respect yourselves...

01:00:51.568 --> 01:00:55.280
...then how do you expect
anyone else to respect you?

01:00:55.572 --> 01:00:56.698
Right?

01:00:56.865 --> 01:00:57.908
Don't respect me.

01:00:58.075 --> 01:00:59.368
No, don't respect me.

01:00:59.535 --> 01:01:01.662
You don't even have to
remember my name.

01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:03.914
- Wow, that's slutty.
- First of all, you slut.

01:01:04.122 --> 01:01:06.333
This is some other dad's problem.

01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:11.046
And, um, I just want to tell you
that you look like my dog.

01:01:11.839 --> 01:01:15.717
- Excuse me?
- Your hair looks like my dog's hair.

01:01:15.968 --> 01:01:18.262
- Oh, um...
- No, it's shiny and soft.

01:01:18.428 --> 01:01:20.722
We give my dog special food.
It's got flax in it.

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:22.766
Oh, flax.

01:01:22.933 --> 01:01:24.601
- She's a sweetheart.
- That's sweet.

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.186
Well, she died.

01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:29.314
So I look like your dead dog?

01:01:29.523 --> 01:01:32.609
I'm just really nervous, and I've wanted
to talk to you for so long.

01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:35.112
- What am I thinking?
- Don't worry about it. Really.

01:01:35.279 --> 01:01:37.573
- Alex?
- Oh, my God, you know my name.

01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:38.907
You're on fire.

01:01:39.116 --> 01:01:42.119
- Really?
- Literally, you're on fire.

01:01:42.286 --> 01:01:43.370
What?

01:01:43.537 --> 01:01:45.038
Literally on fire.

01:01:45.205 --> 01:01:48.959
Whoa. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna
get out of here. Later.

01:01:54.631 --> 01:01:56.258
Just hand me those keys right there.

01:01:56.425 --> 01:01:57.551
They're in for the night.

01:01:58.969 --> 01:02:03.765
If the keys are locked in there, I don't
know how I'm going to get you guys out.

01:02:04.475 --> 01:02:07.269
Conserve some oxygen in there.

01:02:07.436 --> 01:02:10.481
Don't scream, you have
a limited amount of oxygen.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.401
They're pretty, huh?
We got some pretty ladies in here.

01:02:15.694 --> 01:02:17.613
Oh, there you are.

01:02:32.169 --> 01:02:35.130
- What do you want?
- I just want to talk about Stan.

01:02:35.339 --> 01:02:36.715
Yeah?

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:41.595
Why are you dating him?
I mean, you know he is not a nice guy.

01:02:41.762 --> 01:02:43.138
He's crazy.

01:02:43.305 --> 01:02:46.016
Hey, don't say that about Stan.
You don't even know him.

01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:49.686
Oh, but I do. I really do.
I know him better than you.

01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:52.356
Look, we're moving in together
after graduation.

01:02:52.523 --> 01:02:54.316
Stan got into Georgetown?

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.735
- What?
- What?

01:02:56.902 --> 01:03:01.156
No. No. Stan got on the management track
at Home Depot.

01:03:01.323 --> 01:03:02.950
Oh, great.

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:06.995
And I'm going to Westwood Community
College to be closer to him.

01:03:07.621 --> 01:03:09.540
He's my forever.

01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:15.003
- There's no way in hell that's happening.
- Excuse me?

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:18.340
I said, "There's no way in hell
that that is happening."

01:03:19.174 --> 01:03:21.927
You think I'm gonna let you mortgage
your future?

01:03:22.135 --> 01:03:24.471
You think I'll let you throw away
your hard work...

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.849
...everything that you've accomplished...

01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:29.560
...for some psychopathic guy
who doesn't care about you?

01:03:29.726 --> 01:03:33.355
I forbid you. I forbid you
to see him anymore.

01:03:33.522 --> 01:03:38.652
Oh, okay! Who the hell do you think
you are, my father?! Dude!

01:03:38.861 --> 01:03:41.155
- Don't walk away from me.
- You're a freak.

01:03:41.363 --> 01:03:42.823
Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!

01:03:44.616 --> 01:03:47.870
- Hey. How'd it go?
- Fantastic.

01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:50.581
What's on your leg?

01:03:51.248 --> 01:03:53.458
We're the Warriors! Yeah, yeah!

01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:55.794
Remember: Defense wins the game.

01:03:55.961 --> 01:03:58.839
What's wrong? You look uncomfortable.

01:03:59.006 --> 01:04:01.091
Oh. No.

01:04:03.051 --> 01:04:05.637
I was just thinking that
the last time I was here...

01:04:05.804 --> 01:04:08.140
...my husband asked me to marry him.

01:04:08.682 --> 01:04:10.017
Wow.

01:04:10.559 --> 01:04:12.352
Tough to compete with that.

01:04:14.062 --> 01:04:17.149
Down by 6, get the ball to Gold.

01:04:17.316 --> 01:04:19.943
Warriors on three. One, two, three.

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:21.612
Warriors!

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:29.369
Stan, what are you doing? Let's go.

01:04:29.745 --> 01:04:32.581
Go, Alex! Whoo!

01:04:32.748 --> 01:04:33.916
Woo-hoo.

01:04:40.255 --> 01:04:41.632
Left side.

01:04:56.063 --> 01:04:58.065
Pick off! Right there!

01:05:01.151 --> 01:05:02.820
He's got too much time. Come on!

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.244
Yeah!

01:05:13.163 --> 01:05:15.666
Get it to McKinley! Get it in! Get it!

01:05:15.916 --> 01:05:17.334
Get him!

01:05:20.087 --> 01:05:24.341
Ball!

01:05:24.675 --> 01:05:26.176
Come on, outside!

01:05:27.845 --> 01:05:30.973
O'Donnell! Give the ball to Gold!
Give the ball to Gold!

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.350
No, no, no!

01:05:44.736 --> 01:05:49.116
We did it! You were great. Oh.
Ooh. I, um...

01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:51.743
- I'm sweaty. Um...
- Sorry about that.

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.662
Congratula... That was awesome.

01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:56.665
You did a great...
I saw the... I liked the dance.

01:05:57.207 --> 01:06:01.003
Yeah, so I think August...
August will be good.

01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:03.881
All right, uh, have a good night.

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:05.382
See you tomorrow.

01:06:14.183 --> 01:06:18.061
Oh. Hi. Wow, what are the odds?

01:06:18.228 --> 01:06:21.356
What's it going to be now?
Did you buy me the Statue of Liberty?

01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:24.943
I'm just going to ask you out, okay?
Like a grownup.

01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:26.612
Just two fÂ®iends having dinner.

01:06:26.778 --> 01:06:32.034
Then if it turns into anything else,
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

01:06:32.826 --> 01:06:34.912
No. Good night.

01:06:36.121 --> 01:06:37.706
I'll buy every student a laptop.

01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:43.045
You would deny the children of laptops?

01:06:43.212 --> 01:06:46.089
- Miss Masterson, the children.
- Okay. Okay, fine, fine.

01:06:46.715 --> 01:06:49.426
Fine. But this is not a date.

01:06:49.593 --> 01:06:50.761
No, in no way a date.

01:06:50.928 --> 01:06:54.598
And if I do this, you will stop
the inappropriate behavior and gifts.

01:06:54.765 --> 01:06:57.851
- Yes.
- And we'll just drive to this restaurant.

01:06:58.018 --> 01:07:00.187
We won't fly there in the space shuttle...

01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:03.941
...or drive in some gaudy, tacky limo.

01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:06.276
No, let's take your car. How about?

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.573
This way.

01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:15.869
Ned to driver, abort.
Abort, abort. Move it out right now.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:22.417
I totally missed it. She came right up to me,
I should've kissed her. And I froze.

01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:25.128
Hey, don't worry.
I'll get you another chance.

01:07:25.295 --> 01:07:26.880
How? How are you going to do that?

01:07:32.344 --> 01:07:34.471
Victory party at my house!

01:07:48.402 --> 01:07:49.903
Maggie.

01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:02.833
Maggie? Hey, Maggie.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.459
Go away.

01:08:05.252 --> 01:08:07.045
Hey, what happened?

01:08:08.005 --> 01:08:09.381
What do you want?

01:08:09.548 --> 01:08:12.176
Rub it in my face? Say, "I told you so"?

01:08:12.342 --> 01:08:14.928
No. No, I really don't.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.140
Just tell me what happened.

01:08:21.935 --> 01:08:23.687
Stan dumped me.

01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:30.109
Stan dumped you?

01:08:30.277 --> 01:08:32.069
Stan dumped you? What?

01:08:32.237 --> 01:08:35.866
What happened? How did this...?
What did he do?

01:08:36.033 --> 01:08:37.618
What did he do?

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:40.037
After the game...

01:08:40.662 --> 01:08:41.997
We...

01:08:42.872 --> 01:08:45.209
He took me behind the quad, and we...

01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:48.712
I can't hear this. You didn't.

01:08:48.879 --> 01:08:51.881
- No, Mags.
- No.

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:55.010
No.

01:08:55.636 --> 01:08:58.305
That's why he dumped me.

01:09:02.643 --> 01:09:04.353
Mags, hey.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.064
Hey, hey, it's okay.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:10.901
You know...

01:09:12.152 --> 01:09:15.988
...when you're young, everything feels
like the end of the world.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.952
It's not.

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:21.912
Right.

01:09:22.412 --> 01:09:24.581
It's just the beginning.

01:09:25.916 --> 01:09:28.669
You might have to meet
a few more jerks...

01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:30.837
...but one day
you're going to meet a boy...

01:09:31.004 --> 01:09:34.006
...who treats you the way
that you deserve to be treated:

01:09:36.468 --> 01:09:39.345
Like the sun rises and sets with you.

01:09:44.935 --> 01:09:47.020
You really think so?

01:09:49.106 --> 01:09:51.108
I know so.

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:54.945
That's so sweet.

01:09:55.779 --> 01:09:57.739
You're the sweetest.

01:09:58.282 --> 01:10:00.325
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

01:10:00.492 --> 01:10:01.702
- Ow. Oh.
- Thank you.

01:10:03.453 --> 01:10:07.708
Anyways, I, uh, came over here...
I was looking for you.

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:11.378
I wanted to invite you to my party.
I don't know if you want to come.

01:10:11.545 --> 01:10:13.463
- Yes. I would love to.
- Yeah.

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:15.799
- Great. That's exciting.
- Thank you!

01:10:15.966 --> 01:10:17.759
- Aah! Yay!
- Yes. Yay.

01:10:17.926 --> 01:10:19.511
- Thank you.
- That's very exciting.

01:10:19.678 --> 01:10:22.306
I know, it's great. Ha, ha.

01:10:22.473 --> 01:10:24.099
See you tonight.

01:10:32.608 --> 01:10:33.984
"At Mark's house."

01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:57.007
Hey, that's cool. Let me see that.
That is nice, man.

01:10:57.174 --> 01:10:59.259
Don't touch the toys, okay?

01:11:00.344 --> 01:11:03.096
Yeah, I'll, uh, try not to light myself
on fire tonight.

01:11:03.263 --> 01:11:06.892
- I'll keep a fire extinguisher handy.
- Oh, good.

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:11.188
- Do you want to sit outside?
- Sure.

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:46.974
That's delightful.

01:11:51.228 --> 01:11:53.522
What? What?

01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:59.736
- Okay, I don't know how to act normal.
- Clearly.

01:11:59.903 --> 01:12:04.575
It's the story of my life. I'm not smooth.
I'm just trying to impress you, okay?

01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:08.162
I'm not the kind of guy who comes
to places like this. I'm a dork.

01:12:08.328 --> 01:12:09.997
The kind of guy who spends 10 grand...

01:12:10.164 --> 01:12:12.749
...on Gandalf the Grey's quarterstaff
from The Two Towers.

01:12:14.585 --> 01:12:16.420
Yes, that does make you a dork.

01:12:20.007 --> 01:12:22.676
Especially since Gandalf the Grey
was only in Fellowship.

01:12:24.386 --> 01:12:27.931
He returns in Two Towers
as Gandalf the White.

01:12:51.455 --> 01:12:54.541
I was upset. I'm sorry, okay?

01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:58.045
I need you to show me that you love me.

01:12:58.212 --> 01:13:00.172
And that way
we can get a place together.

01:13:00.339 --> 01:13:03.467
Stop it. Look, whatever.
I'm with somebody else now.

01:13:04.134 --> 01:13:07.346
- What?
- Party's over, Stan.

01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:09.640
Just get out of here.

01:13:12.976 --> 01:13:14.520
Oh, yeah?

01:13:15.145 --> 01:13:17.314
Who's gonna make me leave?

01:13:18.857 --> 01:13:19.942
You?

01:13:20.108 --> 01:13:23.987
You know I would, but it smells
like you've been drinking...

01:13:24.154 --> 01:13:27.074
...so I'm just gonna let the cops do it.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.747
You can have the nun.

01:13:34.373 --> 01:13:36.166
She doesn't put out, anyway.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.668
On second thought...

01:13:42.673 --> 01:13:45.759
Oh, I just had the craziest dream.

01:13:47.719 --> 01:13:49.680
I was 17.

01:13:51.265 --> 01:13:54.643
I was back in high school,
and it was terrible.

01:13:58.605 --> 01:14:00.190
Scar.

01:14:01.233 --> 01:14:04.778
Scar? I don't see a scar.

01:14:05.195 --> 01:14:08.198
Look, I know why you didn't
want me to be with Stan.

01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:10.993
It's because you wanted me.

01:14:14.079 --> 01:14:16.832
You want to play games?
I can play games.

01:14:16.999 --> 01:14:19.418
- No, no, no.
- I'm a hungry lioness...

01:14:19.585 --> 01:14:21.378
...and you're a baby gazelle.

01:14:23.005 --> 01:14:25.215
Maggie! No, no, no,
Maggie, stop this now.

01:14:25.382 --> 01:14:28.844
If you only knew how highly inappropriate
and dysfunctional this is.

01:14:29.386 --> 01:14:30.554
Stop it. Please stop.

01:14:30.721 --> 01:14:33.390
Maggie, I'm not the person
that you think I am.

01:14:33.557 --> 01:14:35.142
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

01:14:35.309 --> 01:14:37.936
You're right, you're good.
You're not like the others.

01:14:38.103 --> 01:14:40.772
I'm not like others.
I'm very different than the others.

01:14:40.939 --> 01:14:44.943
So different, in fact, that you and I can
never, ever, ever, ever be together.

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:46.945
- Stop biting.
- Why?

01:14:50.324 --> 01:14:51.658
Oh.

01:14:51.992 --> 01:14:55.787
Oh, my God. What are you saying?

01:14:55.954 --> 01:14:57.414
Are you confused?

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.501
I'm very confused, yes.
Extremely confused.

01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:05.005
Oh, my God. I... I... I get it now.

01:15:05.422 --> 01:15:10.093
And your hair is always perfectly coiffed,
and you have highlights.

01:15:11.678 --> 01:15:14.389
- What are you talking about?
- I mean...

01:15:14.973 --> 01:15:17.935
Dude, your jeans are really tight.

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:21.688
I'm not gay.

01:15:22.439 --> 01:15:24.817
I'm in love, Maggie. I'm in love.

01:15:25.234 --> 01:15:26.652
I've been in love.

01:15:26.819 --> 01:15:30.864
I've been in love with the same girl
since I was 17, Maggie.

01:15:32.741 --> 01:15:37.788
Does she go to our school? Do I know her?
Tell me her name. I want to know her name.

01:15:37.955 --> 01:15:40.082
- No, Maggie. No.
- Okay.

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:46.213
You tell your girlfriend
she better keep a close eye on you.

01:15:51.385 --> 01:15:53.470
Sweet baby Jesus.

01:15:55.305 --> 01:15:56.849
Thanks.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.535
We'll take the check.

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:29.715
I'm so dead.

01:16:33.594 --> 01:16:35.387
Excuse me.

01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:39.349
- Scarlet? Scarlet? Scarlet.
- Hi.

01:16:39.516 --> 01:16:41.351
- What are you doing here?
- You seen Alex?

01:16:41.518 --> 01:16:43.479
He's not picking up his phone.

01:16:43.645 --> 01:16:45.481
Alex is fine. Alex is fine, believe me.

01:16:45.647 --> 01:16:47.691
In fact, with the way things are going...

01:16:47.858 --> 01:16:51.195
...by the end of the night
Alex could have a girlfriend.

01:16:51.361 --> 01:16:54.656
- Alex has a girlfriend?
- Yeah, and she's great. She's cute.

01:16:54.823 --> 01:16:56.408
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Where?

01:16:56.575 --> 01:16:59.495
Walk up the stairs. Walk with me
for one sec, I'll show you.

01:16:59.661 --> 01:17:02.331
So how ever did you get
the newest version of Halo?

01:17:02.498 --> 01:17:04.750
It's not due out for another six months.

01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:10.130
Well, let's just say I said some things
to the Make-A-Wish people...

01:17:10.297 --> 01:17:12.424
...that I'm not totally proud of.

01:17:23.185 --> 01:17:24.812
I'm going to kill him.

01:17:41.078 --> 01:17:43.330
Everybody, out!

01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:51.046
Oh, no, no.
No! No! No! Not Dr. Philsopholis.

01:17:54.049 --> 01:17:55.884
This party is over!

01:17:56.051 --> 01:18:01.557
Unless you want to spend the next
three months in detention, leave! Now!

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:06.186
Okay. We better go warn Mark.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:11.942
You really care about him, don't you?

01:18:12.526 --> 01:18:16.196
- Yeah.
- That's nice. That's really nice.

01:18:16.363 --> 01:18:19.116
He really needs a male role model.

01:18:19.283 --> 01:18:20.951
- He's a great kid.
- Mm-hm.

01:18:21.952 --> 01:18:24.079
You know, they both are.

01:18:26.665 --> 01:18:28.625
I think you're a great mother.

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:30.335
Thank you.

01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:33.338
He's on the balcony. He's right there.

01:18:35.841 --> 01:18:39.303
- Mom?
- This has been a really tough time...

01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:42.806
...and you really feel like
part of the family.

01:18:43.098 --> 01:18:47.478
You have no idea how amazing
it is to hear you say that.

01:18:57.696 --> 01:18:58.822
Scarlet.

01:18:58.989 --> 01:19:02.117
Scarlet! Scarlet, I'm not Mark, okay?

01:19:02.284 --> 01:19:06.038
- I'm him, I'm me. Scarlet, I'm your husband.
- Will you stop it already?

01:19:06.205 --> 01:19:09.500
If you'd listen to me, I am the father
of your children! Scar, let me...

01:19:09.666 --> 01:19:12.669
Don't call me that. Don't call me that!

01:19:12.836 --> 01:19:15.589
You are a weirdo little man-child!

01:19:15.756 --> 01:19:17.841
Give me two seconds,
and I can explain this!

01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:19.510
You are a pervert!

01:19:30.354 --> 01:19:33.607
Get out, and get out, and get out.

01:19:33.774 --> 01:19:35.317
You can leave.

01:19:37.569 --> 01:19:42.199
Well, this isn't exactly the
inconspicuous relationship I wanted.

01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:46.870
I'm sure now you can see why
I don't date my students' parents.

01:19:48.622 --> 01:19:50.207
I'm sorry.

01:19:56.213 --> 01:20:00.884
I'm sorry. I had no idea that it was
going to get so out of control.

01:20:01.468 --> 01:20:03.470
- Hm.
- Really?

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.562
- Now I'm sorry.
- I guess I deserved that.

01:20:11.979 --> 01:20:14.815
The second one was out of line.
It was uncalled for. Sorry.

01:20:14.982 --> 01:20:17.234
Are you okay? I'm really sorry.

01:20:19.111 --> 01:20:21.905
Three makes it even. Now we're even.

01:20:24.449 --> 01:20:25.701
How are you? You okay?

01:20:25.868 --> 01:20:27.202
Yeah.

01:20:36.712 --> 01:20:39.464
And finished.

01:20:40.924 --> 01:20:43.260
With the rug area.

01:20:43.427 --> 01:20:45.762
But we've made very good progress.

01:20:46.722 --> 01:20:47.764
We deserve a break.

01:20:48.599 --> 01:20:50.476
I lost my family.

01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:52.936
Hey, Mike?

01:20:53.145 --> 01:20:56.773
If it's any consolation,
I think you really did help your kids.

01:20:57.149 --> 01:21:00.402
You did your job,
and now the hero can move on.

01:21:00.819 --> 01:21:02.613
I don't want to.

01:21:03.405 --> 01:21:06.283
Maybe they don't need me anymore,
but I need them.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.120
Hey, not to be a buzzkill...

01:21:10.287 --> 01:21:11.872
...but you're due in court...

01:21:12.623 --> 01:21:14.291
...in 22 minutes.

01:21:15.292 --> 01:21:17.252
Ned, I need more time.

01:21:17.753 --> 01:21:20.255
- I have to stop this.
- To the Nedmobile.

01:21:20.589 --> 01:21:22.257
- Wait, Ned, Ned, Ned.
- Yes.

01:21:22.424 --> 01:21:26.261
- Pants.
- I should have pants on. Yes.

01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:38.232
Come on, Glenn!

01:21:38.941 --> 01:21:41.193
He's nothing but
a glorified midget wrangler.

01:21:41.485 --> 01:21:43.654
You wouldn't be so big
without that vest!

01:21:43.821 --> 01:21:47.366
Grab that thing that's down there.
Grab it. Just hold that up.

01:21:47.533 --> 01:21:49.451
- Where you get this?
- Best 20 ever spent.

01:21:49.618 --> 01:21:51.495
Saves me a half hour on my commute.

01:21:51.662 --> 01:21:53.997
Dude, just hold it. Hold it way up.

01:22:12.224 --> 01:22:14.893
The whole truth, nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:16.353
I do.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.856
You request a divorce
by the state of California...

01:22:19.022 --> 01:22:21.358
...citing irreconcilable differences.
This correct?

01:22:21.525 --> 01:22:25.445
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Is Michael O'Donnell present?

01:22:25.779 --> 01:22:26.822
No, Your Honor.

01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:30.033
I take his absence as agreement
to the orders of the divorce.

01:22:34.538 --> 01:22:37.708
- You are not requesting sole custody?
- No, Your Honor.

01:22:38.375 --> 01:22:40.294
"You can't handle the truth!"

01:22:41.545 --> 01:22:42.629
What?

01:22:42.796 --> 01:22:46.008
I'm sorry, I panicked. It was the
first thing that came into my mind.

01:22:46.175 --> 01:22:48.802
Your Majesty.

01:22:49.178 --> 01:22:51.305
- Who are you?
- That's my husband's best friend.

01:22:52.639 --> 01:22:54.183
You a lawyer, best friend?

01:22:55.058 --> 01:22:56.560
- Yes.
- No.

01:22:56.727 --> 01:23:00.063
I believe the law degree
in my pocket says so.

01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:04.735
Yes, and it's a little bit smeared
because I sat on it in the car...

01:23:04.902 --> 01:23:08.197
...not because I printed it out recently.

01:23:11.492 --> 01:23:14.161
Let's pretend that's real.
Want to explain what you're doing?

01:23:15.037 --> 01:23:16.538
We...

01:23:17.498 --> 01:23:19.833
...are stopping a gross...

01:23:21.585 --> 01:23:23.086
...miscarriage ofjustice!

01:23:23.962 --> 01:23:25.297
That...

01:23:26.173 --> 01:23:29.051
Okay, if you'd just let me explain.
I can explain this.

01:23:29.218 --> 01:23:30.594
If you would just listen...

01:23:30.761 --> 01:23:34.640
I've got a letter from Mike O'Donnell,
he's the husband in this case!

01:23:34.807 --> 01:23:36.308
I'm sorry. We're in the middle...

01:23:36.475 --> 01:23:39.895
Your Honor, if it's okay,
I'd like to hear the letter, please.

01:23:47.569 --> 01:23:49.238
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:23:52.032 --> 01:23:54.159
This is a letter from Mike O'Donnell.

01:23:54.451 --> 01:23:56.286
He wanted me to read it.

01:23:59.665 --> 01:24:01.208
"Scarlet...

01:24:03.085 --> 01:24:05.254
...before you go through with this...

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:09.716
...I want to remind you
of September 7th, 1988.

01:24:12.094 --> 01:24:13.929
It was the first time that I saw you.

01:24:16.431 --> 01:24:18.559
You were reading Less Than Zero.

01:24:19.268 --> 01:24:22.938
You were wearing
a Guns N' Roses T-shirt.

01:24:25.315 --> 01:24:27.985
I'd never seen anything so perfect.

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:34.950
I remember thinking
that I had to have you, or I'd die.

01:24:38.287 --> 01:24:39.997
Then you whispered that you loved me...

01:24:43.041 --> 01:24:45.002
...at the homecoming dance.

01:24:48.672 --> 01:24:50.174
And I felt...

01:24:51.008 --> 01:24:52.759
...so peaceful...

01:24:54.928 --> 01:24:56.472
...and safe.

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.727
Because I knew that no matter
what happened from that day on...

01:25:01.894 --> 01:25:04.396
...nothing could ever be that bad.

01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:06.982
Because I had you.

01:25:08.942 --> 01:25:10.277
Uh...

01:25:11.028 --> 01:25:12.571
And then I grew up...

01:25:14.198 --> 01:25:16.033
...and I lost my way.

01:25:19.077 --> 01:25:21.622
And I blamed you for my failures.

01:25:25.959 --> 01:25:29.046
And I know that you think
you have to do this today.

01:25:31.048 --> 01:25:32.883
I don't want you to.

01:25:37.846 --> 01:25:39.389
But I guess...

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:44.728
...if I love you...

01:25:48.357 --> 01:25:50.526
...I should let you move on."

01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:56.365
All right, son, you need to go now.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.389
Let's proceed.

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.269
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Would it be okay...

01:26:25.435 --> 01:26:28.397
...if we postpone
this for now for just a little while?

01:26:28.564 --> 01:26:30.232
Would that be okay?

01:26:31.150 --> 01:26:32.901
Postponed 30 days. Next case.

01:26:59.678 --> 01:27:01.972
Haven't seen you practice
this hard since school.

01:27:02.139 --> 01:27:05.184
Yeah, you know, if I want
to impress these college scouts...

01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:07.769
...then I need to stay focused.

01:27:07.936 --> 01:27:11.440
Wait, wait. You're not still trying
to get a scholarship, are you?

01:27:12.024 --> 01:27:15.986
Be careful, man. You do not want
to get off of the spirit path.

01:27:16.153 --> 01:27:20.616
There's no path, Ned! There's no path!
I can't do it!

01:27:20.866 --> 01:27:22.534
I just made it worse for them.

01:27:22.701 --> 01:27:27.498
My wife is happier, everyone's happier
with me out of the picture, Ned.

01:27:28.207 --> 01:27:29.958
It's time to move on.

01:28:02.366 --> 01:28:04.117
It's time to go, Mom.

01:28:18.215 --> 01:28:21.051
Hey, Gold, save something
for the game, huh?

01:28:21.218 --> 01:28:23.137
Just warming up, coach.

01:28:23.303 --> 01:28:25.556
Got a little inside info for you.

01:28:25.722 --> 01:28:29.268
The scout from Ohio State is back,
and the coach is with him.

01:28:29.726 --> 01:28:32.146
You play half the game
I know you're capable of...

01:28:32.312 --> 01:28:34.982
...you're going to be playing
college ball next year, huh?

01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:37.151
- That's the plan, coach.
- Give me the ball.

01:28:39.736 --> 01:28:43.031
All right, gather up, jockstraps.
Picture time.

01:28:43.198 --> 01:28:45.075
Try not to break the camera.

01:29:30.454 --> 01:29:33.957
I can't wait to go to Georgetown
and start dating college boys.

01:29:38.795 --> 01:29:42.424
I thought Mark was hanging out
with Alex to get to me, not you.

01:29:43.467 --> 01:29:46.011
All right, ladies, let's bring it in.

01:29:48.263 --> 01:29:50.808
Jane! Jane!

01:29:51.642 --> 01:29:54.478
Jane! I'm sorry, sorry.

01:29:54.728 --> 01:29:56.647
- Ned, Ned, Ned.
- Oh, sorry.

01:29:56.814 --> 01:29:59.566
- Ned. Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

01:30:00.818 --> 01:30:02.945
- I need to talk to you.
- What are you doing?

01:30:03.111 --> 01:30:05.113
I practiced this, uh.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.782
Okay.

01:30:06.949 --> 01:30:13.455
I have just seen my best friend lose
everything than means anything to him.

01:30:13.622 --> 01:30:15.374
And maybe we'll never be there, but...

01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:20.337
Yes, I understand, but I have told you
before that I am the principal...

01:30:20.504 --> 01:30:22.965
- Yes.
...and I cannot be seen...

01:30:23.132 --> 01:30:24.633
...with my students' parents.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:28.011
But, Jane,
how can you be seen with me...

01:30:28.178 --> 01:30:30.806
...when I'm wearing
the cloak of invisibility?

01:30:33.308 --> 01:30:37.437
Jane, all I'm asking is a chance
for us to be friends.

01:30:38.522 --> 01:30:41.441
Because you're the one
I want by my side...

01:30:41.608 --> 01:30:44.945
...when I'm storming
the Elvish Castle of Ganakinesh.

01:30:50.826 --> 01:30:52.953
You can plunder my dungeon anytime.

01:30:53.245 --> 01:30:55.038
I'll bring my long bow.

01:30:55.956 --> 01:30:58.667
Warriors! Yeah!

01:31:01.461 --> 01:31:03.213
Come on.

01:31:16.894 --> 01:31:18.729
Oh, my God.

01:31:18.896 --> 01:31:20.898
Mom? Are you okay?

01:31:22.316 --> 01:31:25.527
I can't be here again. I have to go.

01:31:46.215 --> 01:31:48.550
- The game. That's your future.
- The baby's my future.

01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:52.721
That's crazy, Mike.
No, I can't let you throw this all away.

01:31:52.888 --> 01:31:54.223
Bye, Mike.

01:31:54.389 --> 01:31:55.849
High school star.
Never lived up to potential.

01:31:56.016 --> 01:31:58.519
- What are you doing?
- I want to live in the past.

01:31:58.685 --> 01:32:01.730
I'll bet you wish you had it to
do all over again.

01:32:01.897 --> 01:32:03.190
Hello?!

01:32:03.357 --> 01:32:05.108
It's a classic transformation story.

01:32:05.984 --> 01:32:08.111
Spirit guide?

01:32:08.445 --> 01:32:10.531
You and me, we're in this together.

01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:14.535
It's your turn now.

01:32:22.292 --> 01:32:23.293
Traveling.

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.962
Green ball!

01:32:25.295 --> 01:32:27.297
O'Donnell, get in there!

01:32:27.464 --> 01:32:28.882
Scarlet!

01:32:30.259 --> 01:32:31.635
Scar?

01:32:33.262 --> 01:32:34.805
Scarlet?

01:32:53.115 --> 01:32:54.700
It is you.

01:33:01.582 --> 01:33:02.708
Hi.

01:33:04.334 --> 01:33:05.627
"Hi"?

01:33:07.337 --> 01:33:08.464
I can explain.

01:33:10.466 --> 01:33:11.842
You can?

01:33:12.009 --> 01:33:13.927
No, not at all.

01:33:15.512 --> 01:33:19.391
- You didn't have to come after me again.
- Yes, I did, because I love you.

01:33:20.184 --> 01:33:23.312
You're the best decision
I ever made, I just forgot.

01:33:24.771 --> 01:33:29.318
And then I fell off a bridge
and things got pretty weird after that.

01:33:29.485 --> 01:33:31.737
But I'm never going to forget again.

01:33:33.322 --> 01:33:37.034
Look, I know that I've been
in a bad mood for the last...

01:33:37.659 --> 01:33:39.161
...20 years.

01:33:40.204 --> 01:33:44.666
But if you let me, I swear, I will spend
the rest of my life making it up to you.

01:33:46.043 --> 01:33:48.712
I thought I wanted
a second chance at life...

01:33:48.879 --> 01:33:52.424
...but now I know I just want
a second chance with y...

01:33:56.136 --> 01:33:57.513
Weird.

01:33:57.888 --> 01:33:59.223
Yeah.

01:34:01.058 --> 01:34:02.684
I missed you.

01:34:09.733 --> 01:34:14.696
Yeah, I'm gonna put you down
because this was a lot easier before.

01:34:15.364 --> 01:34:18.826
Yeah, you did have that six-pack
thing going.

01:34:18.992 --> 01:34:20.869
Is there any chance I'll see that again?

01:34:21.036 --> 01:34:23.705
I knew you were checking me out.

01:34:26.250 --> 01:34:29.545
Go! Go! Go!

01:34:32.381 --> 01:34:34.550
Adults can have that, though.

01:34:34.716 --> 01:34:37.553
Well, I'll work on it.
Maybe I'll jog home.

01:34:45.018 --> 01:34:46.061
Ned, hey.

01:34:46.228 --> 01:34:49.690
I packed up all my stuff and I wanted
to give your key back and say thanks.

01:34:49.857 --> 01:34:51.316
Hey, whoa. No. No.

01:34:51.483 --> 01:34:54.862
Wasn't expecting to see
you there, Principal Masterson.

01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:57.156
You look very pretty.

01:34:57.322 --> 01:34:58.365
Thank you.

01:34:58.532 --> 01:35:00.117
The Force is strong in this one.

01:35:00.284 --> 01:35:02.828
So I guess I'll be
seeing you at work, boss.

01:35:02.995 --> 01:35:05.539
Oh, yes, uh, Coach O'Donnell.

01:35:05.706 --> 01:35:08.917
And, um, we are very happy
to have you aboard.

01:35:09.626 --> 01:35:12.880
Buddy, I got you a little something
for your first day at your new job.

01:35:13.046 --> 01:35:15.924
Don't think about how much it cost,
it's not much.

01:35:17.968 --> 01:35:20.053
Hey, you got me a whistle.

01:35:21.472 --> 01:35:22.639
Don't blow it.

01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:26.393
Play big.

01:35:27.186 --> 01:35:28.270
You too.

01:35:29.938 --> 01:35:31.648
- Good luck.
- Love you!

01:35:31.815 --> 01:35:33.317
Love you!
