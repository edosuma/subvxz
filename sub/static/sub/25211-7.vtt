00:36.769 --> 00:40.339
I told you to stop it

00:40.372 --> 00:43.342
and you didn't stop.

00:43.375 --> 00:46.545
Henry, you kissed me!
Do you not remember that?

00:46.579 --> 00:50.219
You forced...
your fingers... inside me

00:50.249 --> 00:52.689
and I told you no.

01:00.893 --> 01:02.463
Fuck.

01:02.495 --> 01:03.725
What happened?

01:08.200 --> 01:10.270
I don't know, man.

01:10.302 --> 01:13.102
Did Henry Coles do this?

01:13.139 --> 01:14.416
I'm sorry, but I was in
the next room.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.684
I heard what she was saying
to you...

01:15.708 --> 01:18.148
I don't know
what she was talking about.

01:18.177 --> 01:19.788
All right, Lucas?
I didn't do anything to her.

01:19.812 --> 01:21.412
It was not like that.

01:21.447 --> 01:22.817
Hey, hey, hey. You hear me?

01:22.848 --> 01:24.118
Right?

01:24.150 --> 01:26.120
It wasn't like that.

01:26.152 --> 01:27.382
I'm not like that.

01:27.419 --> 01:29.319
No, I know, I know, I know.

01:29.355 --> 01:32.795
It's cool. All right, we
better clean this shit up.

01:59.885 --> 02:01.355
Clay Boone?

02:01.387 --> 02:02.757
I'm Deputy Hulce.

02:02.788 --> 02:04.488
We haven't officially met.

02:04.523 --> 02:05.834
I'm responding
to a disturbance call

02:05.858 --> 02:06.935
from one of your neighbors.

02:06.959 --> 02:08.229
They said somebody threw a rock

02:08.259 --> 02:09.530
through your window.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.641
I assume you know
what I'm talking about.

02:12.665 --> 02:14.335
Yeah, I do.

02:14.366 --> 02:15.836
Well, did you see who did it?

02:18.237 --> 02:19.477
No, no...

02:19.505 --> 02:21.375
I was in my room.
I was doing some PT.

02:21.407 --> 02:24.377
You know, some exercises.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.410
You know, I was
the first responder

02:26.445 --> 02:28.515
right after your accident.

02:28.547 --> 02:30.747
How you been holding up?

02:30.783 --> 02:32.953
Still sitting.

02:32.985 --> 02:34.225
So...

02:37.223 --> 02:39.523
- Your father home?
- No, he's at work.

02:39.558 --> 02:41.358
Would you mind if
I take a look around

02:41.393 --> 02:42.837
and make sure there's
no other signs of forced entry?

02:42.861 --> 02:44.861
Actually... actually,
I think we're good here.

02:47.733 --> 02:49.973
All right.

02:50.002 --> 02:51.442
Okay.

02:51.470 --> 02:53.210
Well...

02:53.239 --> 02:56.409
if you see any... thing
suspicious, or any other...

02:56.442 --> 02:57.482
We'll give you a call.

02:59.612 --> 03:00.652
Okay.

03:29.441 --> 03:30.541
Hey, what's up?

03:39.451 --> 03:40.721
Sweet playlist, man.

03:40.753 --> 03:41.823
It's not a playlist.

03:41.854 --> 03:42.954
What?

03:42.988 --> 03:45.328
It's not a playlist.
It's a mood.

03:45.357 --> 03:47.857
Okay. Cool.

03:47.893 --> 03:49.433
Hey, man, grab me a shot.

03:49.461 --> 03:50.431
Let's do shots.

03:50.462 --> 03:51.932
Yeah!

03:51.964 --> 03:54.864
You want next game?

03:54.900 --> 03:56.770
No, no, I'm good, man.

03:56.802 --> 03:58.872
All right.

04:01.340 --> 04:02.780
Yo, Daron, what's up!

04:04.610 --> 04:06.050
Yo, Clay, I thought you said

04:06.078 --> 04:07.748
only a few friends
were coming over.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.850
I mean, they might've
invited some friends

04:09.882 --> 04:12.382
as well, but...

04:12.418 --> 04:14.358
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

04:14.386 --> 04:16.986
Should you be mixing that
with your meds?

04:17.022 --> 04:18.862
Absolutely.

04:22.494 --> 04:24.394
Come on, you got to
give us something.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.630
Look at his face.

04:25.664 --> 04:27.504
That... that is the face of a man

04:27.533 --> 04:30.333
who has had some pussy
on his face.

04:30.369 --> 04:31.769
Out of here.

04:31.804 --> 04:34.644
I know. I know you...

04:34.673 --> 04:36.413
You're an idiot.

04:38.811 --> 04:40.051
Hey, babe,

04:40.079 --> 04:41.479
you want to get me another beer?

04:41.513 --> 04:43.083
No.

04:46.652 --> 04:47.952
Serves you right.

04:49.755 --> 04:53.355
Yeah!

04:55.461 --> 04:56.431
Boop!

04:56.462 --> 04:57.532
I'm sorry, miss.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.433
Is this a pedestrian walkway?

04:59.465 --> 05:00.705
Seriously?

05:02.568 --> 05:04.468
Look, thanks for being cool

05:04.503 --> 05:05.743
with me bringing Damian.

05:05.771 --> 05:07.041
Yeah.

05:07.072 --> 05:09.342
Yeah, he's...

05:09.375 --> 05:10.445
one of a kind.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.776
Yep.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.020
Um, listen.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.690
Can I ask you something?

05:21.553 --> 05:24.493
And I want you to be, like,
totally honest with me.

05:26.658 --> 05:27.758
Okay.

05:27.793 --> 05:28.970
I mean, it's not bad
or anything.

05:28.994 --> 05:30.594
I just...

05:32.965 --> 05:35.735
Was I good to you?

05:35.768 --> 05:36.938
Like, as a boyfriend?

05:38.771 --> 05:40.048
Like, did you buy me
enough candles

05:40.072 --> 05:41.416
before you decided
to screw around?

05:41.440 --> 05:43.540
No, no.

05:43.575 --> 05:45.045
I mean, did you ever...

05:45.077 --> 05:47.717
Did you ever feel like

05:47.746 --> 05:49.616
like I put pressure on you?

05:51.049 --> 05:52.949
To...

05:52.985 --> 05:54.015
Pressure to do what?

05:56.522 --> 05:58.722
Sleep with you?

05:58.757 --> 06:00.427
I guess. I mean...

06:00.459 --> 06:02.099
Were there times when
maybe it felt like

06:02.127 --> 06:05.027
I was more in the mood
than you were?

06:05.063 --> 06:06.933
Well, you're a guy,
so obviously,

06:06.965 --> 06:08.765
sometimes, yeah.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.901
But I never did anything
I didn't want to do with you.

06:14.573 --> 06:16.743
That's not who I am.

06:19.511 --> 06:20.911
Okay.

06:22.047 --> 06:24.487
Where is this coming from?

06:24.516 --> 06:26.956
No, I just... I've had a lot
of time to think, you know?

06:28.554 --> 06:30.424
- Okay.
- So, yeah.

06:38.997 --> 06:40.667
Chug! Chug! Chug!

06:54.613 --> 06:56.753
Hey, Clay, dude...

06:56.782 --> 06:57.882
Wake up.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.686
Hey. What happened?

07:02.721 --> 07:04.991
Man, I told you
to be careful mixing.

07:10.896 --> 07:12.166
Where'd everyone go?

07:38.190 --> 07:39.830
Hey, Lucas.

07:42.294 --> 07:43.564
What's up?

07:46.231 --> 07:47.701
I can't...

07:47.733 --> 07:49.503
I can't believe this is me.

07:52.271 --> 07:53.511
You know?

07:56.174 --> 07:57.814
This is my life.

08:19.998 --> 08:21.938
Just yell if you think
you're gonna be sick.

08:21.967 --> 08:23.567
All right?

09:28.934 --> 09:29.934
What the fuck?

09:31.703 --> 09:33.073
Shit!

09:39.745 --> 09:41.345
Help!

09:41.380 --> 09:43.980
Help, Lucas! Lucas!

10:30.162 --> 10:31.932
Breakfast?

10:33.932 --> 10:34.972
Yeah.

10:49.414 --> 10:51.684
What the hell went on in here?

10:55.153 --> 10:57.123
Threw a party last night
for the team.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.690
After the loss to Lincoln,
you know,

11:00.726 --> 11:02.566
everyone kind of wanted
to blow off some steam.

11:06.298 --> 11:08.738
And, it kind of got out of hand.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.305
You hung over?

11:19.845 --> 11:20.885
A little, yeah.

11:23.215 --> 11:24.415
Good.

11:27.252 --> 11:29.152
May the punishment
fit the crime.

11:35.026 --> 11:36.726
Better get busy cleaning.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.162
Hey, Dad.

11:39.197 --> 11:41.497
Where'd you go?

11:41.533 --> 11:43.373
Had to take care of some stuff.

11:44.836 --> 11:45.947
Listen, I'm gonna
call the Millers

11:45.971 --> 11:48.111
and set up a meet.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.380
This thing'll be over soon.

11:51.243 --> 11:52.913
Right.

11:59.885 --> 12:00.955
Yo, what was that about?

12:03.021 --> 12:06.221
Listen, there's something
I want to show you.

12:06.258 --> 12:07.798
Just...

12:07.826 --> 12:09.626
go get dressed, will you?
I'll finish up here.

12:11.496 --> 12:13.396
So what, you and Dad
put together

12:13.431 --> 12:15.271
another old roadster or
something?

12:23.975 --> 12:26.087
- What the hell is this?
- Hold on, just let me explain.

12:26.111 --> 12:28.055
Are you fucking kidding me, man?
I don't want to see this shit.

12:28.079 --> 12:29.957
I wouldn't've brought you here
if it wasn't important.

12:29.981 --> 12:31.325
What, 'cause you want me to face
my fears or some shit, man?

12:31.349 --> 12:32.827
- Fuck you!
- Clay, just... just fucking

12:32.851 --> 12:33.961
listen to me, okay? Just listen.

12:33.985 --> 12:35.285
Henry was with you

12:35.320 --> 12:36.790
when this shit happened
to your car.

12:36.822 --> 12:38.052
Right?

12:38.089 --> 12:39.059
- Right?
- Yeah.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.960
Okay.

12:40.992 --> 12:42.432
She

12:42.460 --> 12:44.100
was in my trunk

12:44.129 --> 12:45.329
just before this happened.

12:45.363 --> 12:47.263
Wait, what?
Why was she in your trunk?

12:47.299 --> 12:49.039
Okay, it d... it doesn't matter.

12:49.067 --> 12:51.037
Honestly, I-I know
that sounds nuts,

12:51.069 --> 12:52.580
but look, my trunk and your
car... it's like the same shit

12:52.604 --> 12:54.348
happened to both of them,
like the same kind of

12:54.372 --> 12:55.872
fucking suck bomb or some shit

12:55.907 --> 12:57.177
went off inside them.

12:57.209 --> 12:58.179
Right, okay,

12:58.210 --> 12:59.480
so Henry put...

12:59.511 --> 13:01.911
She planted bombs
in the both of our cars?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.191
- Is that what you're saying?
- No, I'm just saying,

13:03.215 --> 13:04.445
she said she did this to you.

13:04.482 --> 13:05.852
Why would she say that

13:05.884 --> 13:06.854
if she didn't mean it?

13:06.885 --> 13:08.325
Because she's fucking crazy.

13:08.353 --> 13:10.853
- No, man.
- Because she's a liar.

13:10.889 --> 13:13.129
You and I both know
Dad's partners did this.

13:13.158 --> 13:14.869
Yeah, we only know any of that
shit because she said so.

13:14.893 --> 13:17.233
And it makes
actual fucking sense,

13:17.262 --> 13:20.002
unlike whatever Benghazi shit you
got whirling around in your head.

13:20.031 --> 13:21.601
Dude

13:21.633 --> 13:24.133
I don't know.
I just have this feeling

13:24.169 --> 13:25.839
and I don't know how else
to describe it.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.541
Well, your feeling's wrong.

13:27.572 --> 13:29.542
Henry was confused, okay?

13:29.574 --> 13:32.544
And people who are confused...
They talk shit.

13:32.577 --> 13:34.347
And now she's got us
both freaking out

13:34.379 --> 13:37.449
because you can't mind
your own goddamn business.

13:37.482 --> 13:39.122
Everything she was saying
last night

13:39.150 --> 13:41.050
was insane.

13:41.086 --> 13:42.856
Don't let her
fuck with your head too.

13:44.923 --> 13:46.923
I think she was
telling the truth.

13:50.395 --> 13:51.435
You do?

13:53.265 --> 13:54.305
About everything?

13:57.936 --> 13:59.076
- Clay, man...
- Wow.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.181
All right, you know what, man?

14:00.205 --> 14:02.945
I'm done with this bullshit.

14:07.178 --> 14:09.348
Clay, man, I'm sorry. Hey, boys.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.081
Hey, Gale,
can you grab my paycheck?

14:11.116 --> 14:12.216
Sure thing, honey.

14:12.250 --> 14:15.120
You just missed Henrietta.

14:15.153 --> 14:16.523
What?

14:16.554 --> 14:18.124
She told me what happened.

14:19.624 --> 14:21.094
Dad, I didn't do anything.

14:21.126 --> 14:22.196
She didn't blame you.

14:22.227 --> 14:23.897
She said she threw the rock.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.569
- What?
- I don't know what's going on

14:25.597 --> 14:28.237
between you two, but you better
kiss and make up tonight, okay?

14:28.266 --> 14:31.166
'Cause we need her on our side.
You understand that?

14:31.202 --> 14:32.580
Tonight?
What are you talking about?

14:32.604 --> 14:34.004
Cleo invited us over to

14:34.039 --> 14:35.182
her house tonight for dinner.

14:35.206 --> 14:37.006
Why?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.942
Fuck that. Watch your language.

14:38.977 --> 14:40.017
No, I'm not going to that.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.315
The hell you're not.

14:41.346 --> 14:43.446
- I'm not going, Dad.
- Excuse me.

14:43.481 --> 14:45.251
Bill?

14:45.283 --> 14:46.283
Bill Boone?

14:46.318 --> 14:47.358
What?

14:49.387 --> 14:51.527
Ken Davidson, Lanwood Insurance.

14:51.556 --> 14:53.056
You're the adjuster?
That's right.

14:53.091 --> 14:54.291
We spoke on the phone. Yeah.

14:54.326 --> 14:56.096
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything,

14:56.127 --> 14:58.039
but I've read just about every
magazine you have to offer,

14:58.063 --> 14:59.363
and I'd love to

14:59.397 --> 15:01.237
steal a few minutes of your time

15:01.266 --> 15:03.536
about the accident
involving your son, Clay Boone.

15:03.568 --> 15:06.268
Well, actually, I got a couple
things I have to handle,

15:06.304 --> 15:09.704
but this is my son, Clay.

15:09.741 --> 15:11.281
He can answer
some of your questions,

15:11.309 --> 15:13.049
help you get started.
How about that?

15:16.081 --> 15:19.151
I've, seen pictures
of your truck.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.524
Pretty nasty-looking accident.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.122
Can you tell me
what you remember?

15:26.658 --> 15:28.328
Not much.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.730
I was in my truck, I guess,
and then...

15:30.762 --> 15:33.062
I woke up in a hospital.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.498
Immediately?

15:36.401 --> 15:37.471
Um...

15:39.170 --> 15:40.310
I don't know.

15:43.441 --> 15:46.241
It feel like, one moment, you're in
your truck, the next, the hospital?

15:52.617 --> 15:54.157
Kind of.

15:54.185 --> 15:57.585
Have you ever lost time
before this incident?

16:00.725 --> 16:01.695
What?

16:01.726 --> 16:04.096
Any history of seizures?

16:05.397 --> 16:07.067
It's for the claim.

16:10.735 --> 16:12.035
No.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.442
Was anyone with you or nearby
at the time of the accident?

16:21.146 --> 16:24.346
Listen, man, I just told you
everything I remember.

16:24.382 --> 16:26.422
We good here?

16:26.451 --> 16:28.151
I didn't mean to upset you.

16:28.186 --> 16:30.786
I'm... I'm just trying to
make sure I have all the facts.

16:30.822 --> 16:32.322
Look, I'm the victim here, okay?

16:32.357 --> 16:33.734
I'm the one who's
fucking paralyzed.

16:33.758 --> 16:35.798
So I don't need you
asking all these questions.

16:35.827 --> 16:37.471
- I don't need to relive this shit.
- Look, I didn't mean to...

16:37.495 --> 16:39.465
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Okay, whatever, man.

16:39.497 --> 16:41.342
- Just get the fuck out of here.
- Hey, hey, Clay! Stop.

16:41.366 --> 16:43.806
- I didn't do anything wrong, Dad.
- Stop, stop!

16:43.835 --> 16:46.675
Look, Mr. Davidson,
my son's been through a lot.

16:46.704 --> 16:49.174
Why don't you give me a call
on Monday

16:49.207 --> 16:51.577
and you and I can discuss anything
else you need, all right?

16:53.478 --> 16:54.518
Of course.

16:56.214 --> 16:57.384
Thank you for your time.

17:31.382 --> 17:33.152
I'll get it!

17:52.570 --> 17:54.870
Henry, you kissed me!
Do you not remember that?

17:54.906 --> 17:56.806
Fuck. Of course I remember.

17:56.841 --> 17:59.341
Okay, all right.
So you remember kissing me...

17:59.377 --> 18:00.577
Not now.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.312
I kissed you,

18:02.347 --> 18:04.417
but that doesn't mean
that I wanted it.

18:04.449 --> 18:05.689
You hurt me!

18:17.795 --> 18:19.195
Stop!

18:20.231 --> 18:21.671
Don't move!

19:07.378 --> 19:08.418
Fuck.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.754
I thought that was you.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.726
Are you okay?

19:16.754 --> 19:19.194
Fine.

19:19.224 --> 19:21.494
Just cold.

19:21.526 --> 19:23.426
Well, I'll give you a ride.

19:23.461 --> 19:24.772
No, you really don't
have to do that.

19:24.796 --> 19:25.836
Get in.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.444
Where are you coming from?

19:42.747 --> 19:44.987
Nowhere.

19:45.016 --> 19:48.286
Just taking a walk.

19:48.319 --> 19:50.259
In this weather?

19:50.288 --> 19:52.488
I guess there are worse ideas.

19:54.792 --> 19:57.792
I hadn't been out to the Boones'
place before. It's nice.

19:59.931 --> 20:03.731
See, a neighbor saw
a young blond woman,

20:03.768 --> 20:05.638
about 5'5",

20:05.670 --> 20:07.440
vandalize their window.

20:08.806 --> 20:11.506
I'm 5'6", so...

20:14.445 --> 20:17.445
I thought you
and the Boones were close.

20:17.482 --> 20:18.522
We're not.

20:20.485 --> 20:21.685
Well, maybe I misunderstood.

20:21.719 --> 20:24.659
I... I figured as much because

20:24.689 --> 20:26.289
you were in Clay's car

20:26.324 --> 20:27.494
just before his accident.

20:29.527 --> 20:30.804
But maybe that was
the wrong place...

20:30.828 --> 20:34.328
Are you gonna take me home,
or arrest me?

20:34.365 --> 20:36.365
Are those my two options?

20:42.373 --> 20:46.343
You remind me of this kid
that I used to know.

20:46.377 --> 20:47.817
He has his guard up too.

20:50.014 --> 20:51.654
Sometimes that

20:51.683 --> 20:53.883
takes more energy
than it's worth.

20:53.918 --> 20:57.658
Look, I'm trying to say
that you can talk to me.

20:57.689 --> 20:59.829
Hey, hey, wait! That's not...

20:59.857 --> 21:00.927
God.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.060
Um...

21:04.095 --> 21:05.465
Henry?

21:05.496 --> 21:07.796
Fuck. Um...

21:09.500 --> 21:10.700
Hey.

21:10.735 --> 21:12.675
Fuck.

21:12.704 --> 21:13.674
Hey, are you okay?

21:13.705 --> 21:14.675
No, please!

21:14.706 --> 21:15.776
Please don't touch me.

21:16.841 --> 21:18.311
Here.

21:24.015 --> 21:25.615
I think I should just...

21:25.650 --> 21:26.927
I need to get out of the car
for a minute.

21:26.951 --> 21:28.451
Yeah, yeah, get some air.

21:37.428 --> 21:39.768
You all right?

21:39.797 --> 21:41.797
Yeah, sorry.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.703
I have seizures

21:43.735 --> 21:45.735
and the medication helps.

21:46.904 --> 21:47.944
Okay.

21:50.074 --> 21:52.674
Henry, did you recognize
that man in that photo?

21:57.548 --> 21:59.418
No.

21:59.450 --> 22:00.750
No, I didn't know him.

22:00.785 --> 22:02.585
But maybe you've seen him?

22:02.620 --> 22:03.690
Around with Bill?

22:07.625 --> 22:09.625
I c-can't...

22:09.660 --> 22:11.500
- I can't say.
- Okay, you... you can't why?

22:11.529 --> 22:14.329
Why? Did Bill tell you
not to say anything?

22:16.567 --> 22:18.137
No.

22:18.169 --> 22:21.439
No, it's not that.
It's just that my mom

22:21.472 --> 22:23.512
works for Bill,

22:23.541 --> 22:27.011
so I don't think I can really
be talking about him like this.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.850
I can keep your mom safe.

22:31.883 --> 22:33.083
No, you can't.

22:33.117 --> 22:34.817
You can't.

22:34.852 --> 22:36.130
If you know about Bill,
then why don't you just

22:36.154 --> 22:37.494
do something?

22:37.522 --> 22:38.762
You're a cop. You can...

22:38.790 --> 22:40.690
You can arrest him or something.

22:40.725 --> 22:43.695
It's not that simple.
I need evidence to hold him.

22:47.064 --> 22:49.064
I don't feel good.
Can you please take me home?

22:50.902 --> 22:52.102
Okay.

22:52.136 --> 22:53.180
But just... wait, wait, wait.

22:53.204 --> 22:55.974
Just wait.

22:59.110 --> 23:01.950
If you ever wanna talk,

23:01.979 --> 23:03.179
don't call the station.

23:03.214 --> 23:04.714
Call me directly.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.394
Okay.

23:25.603 --> 23:28.603
I won't tell Cleo
about the rock incident.

23:28.639 --> 23:29.679
Okay?

23:29.707 --> 23:31.947
We can keep that between us.

23:34.078 --> 23:35.418
Thanks for the ride.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.989
What is going on?

23:46.023 --> 23:47.893
Why is Anna Hulce
dropping you off?

23:51.863 --> 23:53.863
I threw a rock

23:53.898 --> 23:55.968
through Bill Boone's window.

23:57.068 --> 23:58.468
What?

23:58.503 --> 24:00.903
- My God...
- Mom, listen...

24:00.938 --> 24:03.908
- Henry...
- I'm really sorry.

24:03.941 --> 24:05.741
Clay and I got into a fight

24:05.776 --> 24:09.146
about the accident

24:09.180 --> 24:10.680
because I left him there

24:10.715 --> 24:12.185
and he was really, really angry

24:12.216 --> 24:14.956
and I just freaked out.
I didn't know what to do.

24:14.986 --> 24:17.586
That is my boss' house.
Do you understand that?

24:17.622 --> 24:20.822
Do you understand the position
that you just put me in?

24:20.858 --> 24:22.669
Do you ever use your head, Henry?
Do you ever think about

24:22.693 --> 24:24.593
anyone but yourself?
Mom, I know, I wasn't

24:24.629 --> 24:26.499
thinking. I could lose
my job over this.

24:26.531 --> 24:27.908
It happened really fast
and I will apologize

24:27.932 --> 24:29.932
to Mr. Boone.
I just got this job!

24:29.967 --> 24:31.178
Do you know how important it is?
I will apologize.

24:31.202 --> 24:32.242
What?

24:32.270 --> 24:33.970
I want to apologize

24:34.005 --> 24:35.575
to Mr. Boone in person,

24:35.606 --> 24:37.146
so that he knows

24:37.174 --> 24:40.044
that it was my fault.

24:40.077 --> 24:42.247
Yeah, okay, well, I think...

24:42.280 --> 24:45.020
Yeah, I-I...

24:45.049 --> 24:46.849
I think that's a good start.

24:46.884 --> 24:48.554
But it doesn't
make up for what you did.

24:48.586 --> 24:49.997
You know, I have to
come up with some kind of

24:50.021 --> 24:51.291
punishment for you.

24:51.322 --> 24:53.892
Okay. That's fine.

24:53.925 --> 24:54.965
Yeah.

24:55.927 --> 24:57.157
I should go to bed.

24:57.194 --> 24:58.164
Yeah, go to your room

24:58.195 --> 24:59.195
and stay there,

24:59.230 --> 25:00.630
and don't...

25:00.665 --> 25:01.905
Don't come back down

25:01.933 --> 25:04.703
for the rest of the night.

25:04.735 --> 25:06.675
I'm really sorry, Mom.
Thank you.

25:35.066 --> 25:36.206
Um, you busy?

25:39.604 --> 25:42.804
Um, kind of, yeah.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.110
Are you okay? You sound weird.

25:45.142 --> 25:48.012
Yeah, Jenna. I'm just tired.

25:57.888 --> 26:00.188
How'd it go with Josh?

26:00.224 --> 26:01.564
It's fine.

26:03.894 --> 26:05.172
Listen, I think
I'm gonna crash...

26:05.196 --> 26:06.596
I had sex tonight.

26:08.666 --> 26:10.366
In my room.

26:10.401 --> 26:11.871
With Zach.

26:11.902 --> 26:14.972
It was... my first time.

26:19.410 --> 26:22.010
Do you want to talk about it?

26:24.915 --> 26:26.785
Maybe, yeah.

26:26.817 --> 26:27.857
Okay.

26:34.325 --> 26:35.295
So how did it go?

26:35.326 --> 26:37.796
It was good.

26:43.334 --> 26:44.374
Um...

26:46.937 --> 26:47.937
You know, actually,

26:47.972 --> 26:50.372
actually, it was...

26:50.408 --> 26:52.408
it was all right.

26:53.811 --> 26:56.251
I don't know. I felt...

26:56.280 --> 26:57.850
sort of

26:57.882 --> 26:59.152
out-of-body.

27:08.893 --> 27:11.163
Was Zach okay to you?

27:11.195 --> 27:13.895
Yeah.

27:13.931 --> 27:15.971
He was sweet,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.340
but

27:17.368 --> 27:21.708
maybe just not the right person.

27:21.739 --> 27:24.009
I don't know.

27:24.041 --> 27:26.211
I feel like there's
something wrong with me.

27:26.243 --> 27:30.453
There's nothing wrong with you.

27:30.481 --> 27:31.451
Look, you're either

27:31.482 --> 27:33.022
into it or you're not.

27:33.050 --> 27:34.850
There are no rules.

27:34.885 --> 27:36.125
But I like rules.

27:38.022 --> 27:39.822
I know you do.

27:42.993 --> 27:44.893
Are you sure you're okay?

27:47.932 --> 27:49.932
Yeah, I will be.

27:53.404 --> 27:58.114
Morning.

27:59.343 --> 28:01.243
Want some eggs?

28:01.278 --> 28:03.418
No, it's too much protein.

28:12.890 --> 28:13.930
So...

28:15.426 --> 28:17.126
Do you remember when you told me

28:17.161 --> 28:19.461
to stay away from Bill Boone?

28:19.497 --> 28:22.267
Yeah.

28:22.299 --> 28:24.439
But then my mom
took a job with him,

28:24.468 --> 28:27.938
and you didn't do anything.

28:27.972 --> 28:30.872
Well, there's no convincing
your mom

28:30.908 --> 28:31.878
once she's made up her mind.

28:31.909 --> 28:34.079
You know that.

28:34.111 --> 28:36.511
Right, but you said
he was dangerous.

28:36.547 --> 28:40.087
- So is he? Is he dangerous, or...
- Well...

28:40.117 --> 28:42.095
Henry, you know that I would never
let your mom work for the guy

28:42.119 --> 28:44.159
if I thought that he was,
you know,

28:44.188 --> 28:45.988
actually gonna hurt someone.

28:46.023 --> 28:47.063
It's not that.

28:48.793 --> 28:51.033
How can I say this? Um...

28:51.061 --> 28:52.361
After Elizabeth got sick,

28:52.396 --> 28:54.366
medical bills started piling up.

28:54.398 --> 28:57.098
Bill Boone swoops in
behind our back,

28:57.134 --> 28:58.934
pays them off.

28:58.969 --> 29:00.769
Said he was doing us a favor.

29:00.805 --> 29:03.305
Yeah, but he's gonna
hold that debt over my head

29:03.340 --> 29:05.140
until the day I die.

29:05.176 --> 29:06.306
And he'll say he's a friend,

29:06.343 --> 29:09.043
but it comes at a price.

29:09.079 --> 29:10.449
Henry, grab your coat.

29:10.481 --> 29:12.081
Why?

29:13.117 --> 29:14.928
I thought a lot about
what happened last night,

29:14.952 --> 29:16.992
and I want to be there
when you apologize to Bill.

29:20.357 --> 29:23.527
Don't you think that I should
do this on my own, Mom?

29:23.561 --> 29:26.031
I just... I really don't wanna,
like, involve you, or...

29:26.063 --> 29:27.403
Henry, stop.

29:27.431 --> 29:28.971
We're going.

29:28.999 --> 29:31.299
I'm gonna be late.

29:31.335 --> 29:33.005
- Come on.
- Mom.

29:44.048 --> 29:45.548
Hi, Bill.

29:45.583 --> 29:46.553
If you have a moment,

29:46.584 --> 29:47.554
my daughter would like

29:47.585 --> 29:49.485
to have a word with you.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.490
Sure. Hi, Henrietta.

29:54.024 --> 29:55.294
Mom,

29:55.326 --> 29:56.566
um, I can handle this

29:56.594 --> 29:58.964
if you wanna get to work.

29:58.996 --> 30:00.236
Henry, we talked about this.

30:00.264 --> 30:02.904
Yeah, I know. I just

30:02.933 --> 30:04.177
would really like to
do this on my own,

30:04.201 --> 30:05.901
so can you please...

30:05.936 --> 30:07.306
You can go on, Cleo.

30:07.338 --> 30:09.108
You know,
Tim is out today, actually,

30:09.139 --> 30:11.079
so you're needed on the floor.

30:11.108 --> 30:12.548
Okay.

30:12.576 --> 30:13.816
Come find me when you're done.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.450
Hey.

30:18.482 --> 30:20.282
Everything okay?

30:20.317 --> 30:22.917
Just here to apologize

30:22.953 --> 30:25.053
in person about last night.

30:25.089 --> 30:27.629
Do you mean the party? Please.

30:27.658 --> 30:29.258
Look, this may sound
unconventional,

30:29.293 --> 30:31.533
but, you know,
I'm glad he had people over.

30:31.562 --> 30:34.032
Poor kid's been down
so much lately, you know?

30:34.064 --> 30:38.174
No, I'm talking about
the broken window.

30:39.503 --> 30:42.303
I threw the rock.

30:42.339 --> 30:44.339
Clay and I got into a fight...

30:44.375 --> 30:46.415
Clay failed
to mention that, but listen,

30:46.443 --> 30:48.013
I, of all people,

30:48.045 --> 30:49.485
know how tempers can flare

30:49.513 --> 30:51.113
when alcohol is involved.

30:52.583 --> 30:54.153
Look at you standing there.

30:54.184 --> 30:55.554
You look terrified.

30:55.586 --> 30:58.026
Have a seat. Come on.

31:02.693 --> 31:07.003
You've been through a lot,
Henrietta,

31:07.031 --> 31:09.331
and I appreciate you
coming here today.

31:09.366 --> 31:11.466
More proof of what
a good girl you are.

31:18.976 --> 31:20.476
You know, I read in the paper

31:20.511 --> 31:23.251
that a young Mennonite OD'd.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.650
And I recognized him.

31:28.686 --> 31:30.086
It's a real shame about

31:30.120 --> 31:31.690
the drug epidemic in this town,

31:31.722 --> 31:32.992
don't you think?

31:34.959 --> 31:35.999
Yeah.

31:38.662 --> 31:41.562
I just really care about Clay.

31:41.598 --> 31:43.998
Like, a lot,

31:44.034 --> 31:47.004
and, I mean, you know that.

31:47.037 --> 31:51.347
So when I saw what happened
to him I felt...

31:51.375 --> 31:52.515
Relieved.

31:52.543 --> 31:53.713
Well, it's interesting

31:53.744 --> 31:56.314
that you would say that.

31:56.347 --> 31:59.247
But again,

31:59.283 --> 32:01.383
I do think it's a shame

32:01.418 --> 32:04.018
what drugs can do to a person.

32:04.054 --> 32:06.224
I wouldn't ask that on anyone,

32:06.256 --> 32:08.256
especially one of my boys.

32:10.627 --> 32:12.467
Just thought that
maybe you had...

32:12.496 --> 32:13.566
Shoot.

32:13.597 --> 32:14.641
Sorry, I gotta cut this short.

32:14.665 --> 32:15.665
I got another meeting.

32:16.667 --> 32:18.137
What?

32:18.168 --> 32:19.468
Okay, that's fine.

32:21.472 --> 32:23.512
Henrietta.

32:23.540 --> 32:26.440
There's no use in picking
at an old scab.

32:26.477 --> 32:27.977
Just takes longer to heal.

32:28.012 --> 32:30.112
You understand?

32:33.717 --> 32:35.687
When I said I'd protect you,

32:35.719 --> 32:37.189
I meant it.

32:52.536 --> 32:54.236
Bill, I'm sorry about
all of this.

32:54.271 --> 32:55.311
Please.

32:55.339 --> 32:56.579
Don't even mention it.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.577
You've got a good kid here.

32:58.609 --> 33:01.209
- Everyone has a bad day.
- Thank you.

33:01.245 --> 33:03.685
Can you have a seat? I just want
to ask Bill a quick question.

33:12.723 --> 33:13.693
Hello.

33:13.724 --> 33:15.624
My name is Ken Davidson.

33:15.659 --> 33:18.129
I have an appointment with
Mr. Boone about a claim.

33:18.162 --> 33:20.062
Okay, you can go ahead
and take a seat,

33:20.097 --> 33:21.107
and I'll let you know
when Bill's ready to see you.

33:21.131 --> 33:22.271
Thank you.

33:30.707 --> 33:33.477
Excuse me.

33:33.510 --> 33:35.055
Could you pass me
one of those magazines?

33:35.079 --> 33:37.379
All I got here
is "Good Housekeeping."

33:38.415 --> 33:39.685
Yeah.

33:39.716 --> 33:41.316
Henry.

33:41.351 --> 33:42.521
Thank you.

33:44.855 --> 33:46.625
Okay, so,

33:46.657 --> 33:48.197
I just invited Bill and the boys

33:48.225 --> 33:50.765
over for dinner tonight.

33:50.794 --> 33:52.394
Why?

33:52.429 --> 33:53.706
Well, it feels like
the right thing to do,

33:53.730 --> 33:55.530
considering how nice
Bill has been

33:55.566 --> 33:56.696
about all of this.

33:56.733 --> 33:57.833
I don't think that.

33:57.868 --> 33:59.468
Bill and Thomas even get along.

33:59.503 --> 34:00.780
Are you sure that that's
a good idea?

34:00.804 --> 34:02.574
I don't think that that's
a good idea.

34:02.606 --> 34:04.176
I get that it might be
awkward for you

34:04.208 --> 34:05.508
after your fight with Clay,

34:05.542 --> 34:06.512
but I think you two
can sit through

34:06.543 --> 34:08.083
one dinner together.

34:08.112 --> 34:10.081
So, do you want me
to give you a ride home?

34:10.114 --> 34:11.994
- I could take my break early.
- No, I can walk.

34:16.386 --> 34:18.326
Just takes longer to heal.

34:18.355 --> 34:19.525
You understand?

34:21.891 --> 34:24.232
When I said I'd protect you,

34:24.261 --> 34:25.301
I meant it.

34:32.202 --> 34:34.242
You shouldn't've done that.

34:34.271 --> 34:35.541
It's dangerous.

34:35.572 --> 34:36.850
What if Bill had caught you
recording him?

34:36.873 --> 34:38.614
You heard him. He likes me.

34:38.641 --> 34:39.782
He thinks that we're, like,

34:39.810 --> 34:41.880
allies or something,

34:41.911 --> 34:43.581
which means that I have access.

34:43.614 --> 34:46.484
That's gotta be good, right?

34:48.685 --> 34:49.885
I need you to tell me

34:49.920 --> 34:51.790
everything you know
about Amos Miller.

34:54.757 --> 34:55.858
I c... I c...

34:55.893 --> 34:57.593
That is the only way I can help.

35:02.366 --> 35:04.136
Bill thinks that Amos is the one

35:04.168 --> 35:06.608
who put Clay in the hospital.

35:13.777 --> 35:16.477
Do you think Amos...

35:16.513 --> 35:18.553
I mean, I know that you said
he overdosed,

35:18.582 --> 35:19.622
but do you think that...

35:19.650 --> 35:22.290
I don't know anything for sure.

35:29.193 --> 35:30.633
Have you seen

35:30.661 --> 35:31.661
a small Bible

35:31.695 --> 35:34.465
with Amos' name on the front?

35:34.498 --> 35:38.198
Either at
Bill's house or the dealership?

35:38.235 --> 35:40.375
No.

35:40.404 --> 35:43.704
But the Boones are coming
to my house for dinner tonight.

35:47.211 --> 35:49.511
Henry left him there,
Thomas, and then she...

35:49.546 --> 35:51.186
Look, it's just a dinner, okay?

35:51.215 --> 35:52.555
You don't owe Bill a thing.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.253
They're not coming over.

35:54.284 --> 35:56.924
- Jenna...
- No, let me make up an excuse.

35:56.954 --> 35:58.494
We could...

35:58.522 --> 36:00.262
I don't know.
I'll say that I'm sick.

36:00.290 --> 36:01.390
Please don't.

36:01.425 --> 36:03.595
It's fine.

36:03.627 --> 36:04.667
How is it fine?

36:06.697 --> 36:08.297
One night's not gonna kill me.

36:08.332 --> 36:09.832
It might.

36:09.866 --> 36:11.706
That family is made up entirely

36:11.735 --> 36:13.475
of people capable of murder.

36:15.906 --> 36:18.506
I can handle it.

36:18.542 --> 36:20.712
Who cares if you can handle it?

36:20.744 --> 36:22.984
You shouldn't have to.

36:23.013 --> 36:25.483
It's like you're trying to
punish yourself or something.

36:29.386 --> 36:31.526
Maybe I am.

36:31.555 --> 36:34.695
Well, that's fucked-up.

36:34.725 --> 36:36.995
Yeah, sure is.

36:37.027 --> 36:38.927
What the hell, Henry?

36:38.962 --> 36:39.932
You're...

36:39.963 --> 36:41.263
practically a misogynist

36:41.298 --> 36:43.038
against yourself now.

37:23.473 --> 37:25.443
I'll get it.

37:48.799 --> 37:49.869
Hi.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.600
Hi. Won't you come in?

38:09.052 --> 38:11.352
You didn't have to
bring anything, Bill.

38:11.388 --> 38:13.758
Please,
it's the least I could do.

38:13.790 --> 38:17.460
We don't get a lot of home
cooking at the Boone house.

38:17.494 --> 38:19.034
I bought that bottle
some years ago,

38:19.062 --> 38:20.032
when I was in Italy.

38:20.063 --> 38:21.033
I was letting it age,

38:21.064 --> 38:22.334
but then I got sober,

38:22.366 --> 38:23.396
and so I'm just glad

38:23.433 --> 38:24.633
it could go to a good home.

38:24.668 --> 38:25.638
I would kill

38:25.669 --> 38:26.869
to go to Italy.

38:26.903 --> 38:28.473
Ever since I saw that movie,

38:28.505 --> 38:29.805
"Under the Tuscan Sun."

38:29.840 --> 38:31.340
Has anyone seen that?

38:31.375 --> 38:32.815
Yeah, I have. It's pretty good.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.843
Isn't it gorgeous?

38:34.878 --> 38:36.348
Italy would suit you.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.720
Well, someday maybe.

38:38.749 --> 38:40.619
Everyone dig in.
Don't let it get cold.

38:40.650 --> 38:41.690
Bill?

38:48.425 --> 38:50.525
You praying, Lucas?

38:50.560 --> 38:52.130
Yeah, yeah.

38:52.162 --> 38:54.462
Um... Sorry, sorry.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.842
It's just something that I
started doing recently. It's...

38:55.866 --> 38:57.506
No, would you...
Please, don't apologize.

38:57.534 --> 38:58.834
We should all do it.

38:58.869 --> 39:00.839
Would you mind leading us?

39:00.871 --> 39:03.011
Yeah.

39:03.039 --> 39:04.009
Yeah.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.080
Yeah?

39:12.582 --> 39:13.882
Thank you, Lord,

39:13.917 --> 39:15.457
for this food we are
about to receive.

39:15.485 --> 39:16.825
In Jesus' name, amen.

39:16.853 --> 39:18.823
Amen. Amen.

39:18.855 --> 39:20.855
Amen.

39:20.891 --> 39:23.431
Clay, when are you
going back to school?

39:23.460 --> 39:26.430
Um... Next week.

39:26.463 --> 39:28.633
Bet you're anxious
to get back at it?

39:28.665 --> 39:31.005
Hang out with your pals
and all that stuff.

39:31.034 --> 39:33.774
Yes, sir, yeah. I've been going
a little stir-crazy at home.

39:35.772 --> 39:38.912
Jenna, would you mind
passing me the rolls, please?

39:38.942 --> 39:40.442
All right, just...

39:46.883 --> 39:48.183
Thanks.

39:48.218 --> 39:49.588
Anytime.

39:53.056 --> 39:56.496
That's quite a scar there
on your arm, Clay.

39:56.526 --> 39:58.696
Yeah.
Broke my arm when I was a kid.

39:58.728 --> 40:00.728
He fell out of a tree.

40:04.601 --> 40:07.501
How do you know that?

40:07.537 --> 40:08.777
I told her.

40:08.805 --> 40:10.705
Henrietta stopped by
the office today

40:10.740 --> 40:12.110
to apologize for the rock,

40:12.142 --> 40:14.022
and, you know, we chatted
about a lot of things.

40:17.180 --> 40:18.880
The wine's good.

40:18.915 --> 40:21.055
Glad to hear it.

40:21.084 --> 40:22.584
You're quite the cook.

40:22.619 --> 40:23.959
Thank you.

40:23.987 --> 40:25.231
How's the chicken?
Is that all right?

40:25.255 --> 40:26.595
Outstanding.

41:08.865 --> 41:10.565
You take the living room.

41:38.028 --> 41:39.171
Hey, hey, I gotta talk to you.

41:39.195 --> 41:40.695
Stay the fuck away from me.

41:40.730 --> 41:41.700
- Lucas, please.
- Hey, hey, hang on.

41:41.731 --> 41:43.631
Just, I...

41:43.667 --> 41:47.067
Look, did Clay...

41:47.103 --> 41:50.173
Did he really do
what you said he did?

41:50.206 --> 41:52.176
I heard you guys talking.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.150
Shit.

41:59.182 --> 42:00.326
- Shit.
- Please leave me alone.

42:00.350 --> 42:02.890
Henry, Henry, listen to me. I...

42:02.919 --> 42:05.859
I am so sorry.

42:09.326 --> 42:11.337
Really, no one should have to
go through that, ever.

42:11.361 --> 42:14.601
I... I mean that.

42:16.833 --> 42:18.073
Look, I just need to know

42:18.101 --> 42:19.101
why you told Clay

42:19.135 --> 42:22.275
that you hurt him.

42:22.305 --> 42:23.705
I can't deal with this
right now.

42:23.740 --> 42:25.180
Please, I ha... I need to know.

42:25.208 --> 42:27.108
Did you lie about the Millers?

42:29.713 --> 42:31.583
Yes, I fucking lied!

42:31.615 --> 42:33.855
Your dad drove me
to their fucking farm

42:33.883 --> 42:36.553
and would not let me leave
until I...

42:39.155 --> 42:40.925
I can't deal with this.

42:47.063 --> 42:49.833
But Magic won
almost twice as many titles.

42:49.866 --> 42:51.806
No, titles are for teams.

42:51.835 --> 42:54.075
You always gotta pay attention
to the personal stats.

42:54.104 --> 42:56.174
Bird had way more
points per game,

42:56.206 --> 42:58.306
more rebounds, better
three-point percentage...

42:58.341 --> 42:59.841
The better free-throw player...

42:59.876 --> 43:01.120
Greatest player of all time,
in my opinion.

43:01.144 --> 43:02.384
Seriously, better than Jordan?

43:02.412 --> 43:03.782
Yeah, Jordan sucked.

43:03.813 --> 43:05.213
I think you've had enough.

43:05.248 --> 43:06.618
You put Bird... Dad...

43:06.650 --> 43:08.390
Shit!

43:08.418 --> 43:09.829
- Hey.
- It's all right, it's all right.

43:09.853 --> 43:11.123
- Jesus.
- It just slipped.

43:11.154 --> 43:13.254
Put some pressure on it.

43:13.289 --> 43:14.800
Use the napkin. Maybe we should go.
I'm gonna take him home.

43:14.824 --> 43:16.194
No! We have a...

43:16.226 --> 43:18.366
We have a first aid kit
in the kitchen.

43:18.395 --> 43:20.006
No, that's fine. We have stuff
that we can fix it with at home.

43:20.030 --> 43:21.073
I'll do it! I'll do it!
I can take care of it.

43:21.097 --> 43:22.197
- Clay!
- No, Henry.

43:22.232 --> 43:23.802
I've got it.

43:23.833 --> 43:24.933
I'll take care of it.

43:24.968 --> 43:26.008
Just go in the kitchen.

43:30.173 --> 43:32.733
- Um, no, no, let me do it. Let me, let me.
- It'll be all right.

43:55.231 --> 43:56.301
I found it.

44:11.381 --> 44:12.781
Put it back.

44:14.250 --> 44:15.750
But this is proof.

44:20.890 --> 44:23.060
We should reconsider
Bill's offer.

44:24.427 --> 44:26.027
Let's agree to meet.

44:35.338 --> 44:36.938
Fucking stings.

44:43.146 --> 44:44.186
Hey.

44:46.282 --> 44:48.252
Are we cool?

44:52.756 --> 44:55.356
Jesus, Henry, I don't get you.

44:55.391 --> 44:56.961
You freak out on me last night,

44:56.993 --> 44:59.133
you ask me to come over today.

44:59.162 --> 45:00.862
Now you're ignoring me.

45:00.897 --> 45:02.437
Is this like a game?

45:02.465 --> 45:04.365
Are you getting off on this
or what?

45:07.904 --> 45:08.904
There, fixed.

45:12.308 --> 45:16.048
Hey, you know, I wouldn't mind
an apology.

45:16.079 --> 45:18.049
For last night.

45:21.785 --> 45:24.285
I'm sorry, what did you say?

45:25.555 --> 45:28.755
It's pretty fucked-up to accuse
someone of something they didn't do,

45:28.792 --> 45:30.992
so I said I'd like an apology.

45:31.027 --> 45:32.267
Something you didn't...

45:32.295 --> 45:33.335
And Henry,

45:33.363 --> 45:34.333
I have enough shit going on

45:34.364 --> 45:35.504
in my life right now

45:35.532 --> 45:37.032
without you spreading rumors,

45:37.066 --> 45:38.377
you know, about me.
You understand?

45:38.401 --> 45:40.201
- You fucking piece of shit!
- Whoa.

45:40.236 --> 45:41.936
I want to know how you do it.

45:41.971 --> 45:43.811
I want to know.
I want to know how

45:43.840 --> 45:45.210
you can live with yourself.

45:48.578 --> 45:50.878
Just calm down.

45:52.182 --> 45:54.182
Hey, Henry!

45:54.217 --> 45:56.257
Henry! Henry!

45:56.286 --> 45:57.326
Henry?

45:59.422 --> 46:00.992
- Henry!
- Mom, please...

46:01.024 --> 46:02.224
What's wrong?

46:02.258 --> 46:04.028
Please, Mom, stay away from me.

46:04.060 --> 46:05.860
- Please.
- Henry, sweetheart, stay with me.

46:05.895 --> 46:08.465
I can't... I can't breathe, Mom.

46:08.498 --> 46:11.068
Baby, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm right here.

46:11.100 --> 46:13.800
Listen, I tried, I tried.

46:13.837 --> 46:15.114
Save your energy, baby.
Don't talk.

46:15.138 --> 46:16.308
I tried. I have to.

46:16.339 --> 46:17.509
- No, you don't.
- I have to.

46:17.540 --> 46:18.980
Clay, in his truck,

46:19.008 --> 46:22.148
he... he forced himself on me

46:22.178 --> 46:23.518
and he forced himself...

46:23.546 --> 46:24.824
He forced himself?
I don't understand.

46:24.848 --> 46:26.148
He... he hurt...

46:26.182 --> 46:28.022
He hurt me, Mom.

46:28.051 --> 46:30.291
Mom...

46:30.320 --> 46:32.360
- Henry, no.
- I can't...

46:32.388 --> 46:33.399
- Henry...
- I can't breathe...

46:33.423 --> 46:36.063
Henry! Henry!

46:36.092 --> 46:38.062
Henry!

46:38.094 --> 46:39.394
Thomas!

46:39.429 --> 46:41.129
Thomas!

46:41.164 --> 46:42.464
I've got you, baby.

46:42.498 --> 46:44.998
- Cleo, what?
- Thomas!

46:45.034 --> 46:47.534
Help me!

46:47.570 --> 46:48.940
My God, baby.
