00:44.087 --> 00:45.880
Can you hear me?

00:49.843 --> 00:52.303
Dad, can you hear me?

01:03.231 --> 01:05.608
You don't need to fight it.

01:08.695 --> 01:11.614
You can just let it all go.

01:19.372 --> 01:21.458
Everything's okay.

01:32.343 --> 01:36.848
I love you, Dad. I do.

01:43.396 --> 01:45.315
I'm so sorry.

01:47.525 --> 01:49.486
Oh, God...

01:57.327 --> 01:59.871
Come on, son.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.165
Okay, now...

02:02.248 --> 02:04.918
can you lay back for me, Bud?

02:06.503 --> 02:08.086
I'm gonna...

02:08.170 --> 02:10.673
I'm just gonna
lay you back, okay?

02:16.054 --> 02:17.430
Okay.

03:14.654 --> 03:16.114
You wanna say anything?

03:16.197 --> 03:18.199
Bye, grandpa.

03:19.826 --> 03:21.411
I love you.

03:34.299 --> 03:36.217
I'm sorry, Bud.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.342
You done?

06:08.745 --> 06:10.913
<i>He has to be involved...</i>

06:10.997 --> 06:14.125
in everything from now on.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.045
Everything.

06:17.128 --> 06:20.214
If he's not, then
we're doing him a disservice.

06:20.298 --> 06:24.010
I don't care, Paul. He's 17.

06:25.470 --> 06:29.265
He shouldn't have been there.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.184
He shouldn't have seen that.

06:33.603 --> 06:35.205
I couldn't have done it
all on my own, Sarah.

06:35.229 --> 06:38.399
I should've been there.
I should've been there instead.

06:43.196 --> 06:45.156
Nobody's gonna blame you for that.

06:49.243 --> 06:53.122
He's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

06:53.206 --> 06:56.501
You don't honestly believe that?

06:58.419 --> 06:59.837
Do you?

07:03.633 --> 07:07.220
Sarah, I'm just trying...

07:07.303 --> 07:10.681
I'm trying to do everything
I can to protect you guys.

07:17.188 --> 07:19.524
It's been a really long day.

07:22.652 --> 07:24.445
Can we get some rest?

08:02.233 --> 08:04.735
Hey, Stanley.

08:04.819 --> 08:08.322
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of you.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.647
- Travis, wake up.
- What's going on?

11:10.671 --> 11:12.423
- There's somebody in the house.
- What?

11:12.506 --> 11:14.592
There's somebody in the house!

11:20.014 --> 11:21.140
Stop...

11:26.979 --> 11:29.148
- Dad...
- Take Stanley.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.734
Let's go!

11:50.628 --> 11:52.838
Wait. Stay back.

12:12.024 --> 12:13.067
Shh!

12:38.884 --> 12:39.885
Wait!

12:42.221 --> 12:44.306
Paul! Wait!

12:45.391 --> 12:47.059
Hey, hey! Slow down!

12:47.142 --> 12:48.143
Hey, hey, hey!

12:48.227 --> 12:49.228
Put the gun down now!

12:49.311 --> 12:51.730
Put the gun down or I'll shoot you!
I'll drop you right now!

12:51.814 --> 12:53.482
- Okay, okay.
- Down!

12:53.566 --> 12:56.277
It was an accident.
No one needs to get hurt.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.067
All right, hands in the air!

13:04.493 --> 13:08.205
Now... lie down. Now!

13:10.374 --> 13:12.167
Roll over. Roll over!

13:16.589 --> 13:18.841
- Are you sick?
- No, sir.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.926
Open your eyes!

13:24.096 --> 13:25.764
- Is anybody else with you?
- No.

13:27.725 --> 13:31.312
If I go outside, there's nobody out there
waiting for me?

13:31.395 --> 13:32.747
- All right, close your eyes.
- Please!

13:32.771 --> 13:33.772
Wait! Wait!

14:06.847 --> 14:09.058
Sarah... come on, quick.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.184
Come on.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.061
- Travis!
- Come here.

14:13.437 --> 14:16.732
- Take this. It's loaded.
- What's going on?

14:16.815 --> 14:19.109
There's a guy in there,
I need you to watch him.

14:19.193 --> 14:20.945
Come on.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.279
Stay close!

14:26.158 --> 14:27.952
Travis!

14:28.035 --> 14:30.537
- I told you, keep quiet!
- Quiet.

14:30.621 --> 14:31.705
Did you kill him?

14:31.789 --> 14:35.417
He's just unconscious.
Are you two okay?

14:37.503 --> 14:38.587
Travis...

14:38.671 --> 14:40.881
I'm gonna need you to get
some rope and some duct tape.

14:40.965 --> 14:43.717
Come on, Stanley, come on!

14:43.801 --> 14:45.511
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

14:47.471 --> 14:50.140
If he comes to, just call out.

14:50.224 --> 14:51.809
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.061
I'll be right back.

16:11.764 --> 16:13.390
- It's me.
- Paul?

16:13.474 --> 16:15.267
It's me! Open up.

16:17.770 --> 16:20.147
I think it's just him.

16:40.626 --> 16:42.252
Push him against the tree.

16:56.475 --> 16:58.060
You know what a foot and a half is?

16:58.143 --> 16:59.603
- Sorry
- It's about that long.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.979
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.290
- Do it again. It's okay.
- Like this?

17:02.314 --> 17:03.440
Yeah.

17:03.524 --> 17:05.192
Now put it around his face.

17:05.275 --> 17:08.028
- He still has to be able to breathe, Dad.
- Put it around.

17:08.112 --> 17:10.280
He can breathe out his nose.

17:28.674 --> 17:31.468
Okay, put it up.

18:39.995 --> 18:42.456
Help me!

18:42.539 --> 18:44.041
Help!

19:43.850 --> 19:46.353
Hey! Get up!

19:47.729 --> 19:50.023
Get on your feet now.

20:17.009 --> 20:18.552
You see this?

20:20.345 --> 20:23.432
I don't have to use this,
but I will if I have to.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.194
I just wanna talk.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.950
And I want honest answers.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.499
If you give me honest answers,

20:49.583 --> 20:52.002
then this is yours.
Understand?

21:15.025 --> 21:16.943
Why'd you break into my house?

21:26.620 --> 21:29.081
I promise...

21:29.164 --> 21:31.708
I promise you, I... I...

21:32.709 --> 21:36.254
I didn't think anyone was in it.

21:36.338 --> 21:40.300
There's no lights and the thing's boarded
up. It looked abandoned from the outside.

21:42.511 --> 21:44.513
- What were you looking for?
- Water...

21:44.596 --> 21:46.348
supplies, anything.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.642
My family...

21:48.725 --> 21:50.769
I have a family...

21:50.852 --> 21:53.271
my wife and our boy in the woods.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.232
- Where?
- An abandoned house,

21:55.315 --> 21:56.817
about 50 miles from here.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.087
- Why'd you just leave them?
- We're running out of water.

21:59.111 --> 22:02.215
I left them with the rest of the food and
water. I thought they'd be safer that way.

22:02.239 --> 22:03.615
- Are they sick?
- No.

22:03.698 --> 22:06.451
- Is that why you left them?
- No. No, sir, they are not sick.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.221
Listen, I don't even have to shoot you,
you know?

22:08.245 --> 22:10.288
I could just leave you out here.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.916
- You want this water?
- Yeah.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.961
- You make me believe you.
- I'm telling you the truth.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.464
I don't know
how much time they have.

22:23.552 --> 22:25.947
All right, so how long have you been
living in this abandoned house?

22:25.971 --> 22:27.139
About a week, tops.

22:27.222 --> 22:28.515
How'd you get there?

22:28.598 --> 22:30.701
My truck broke down.
It's the first place that we found.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.245
- Where were you before?
- My brother's.

22:32.269 --> 22:34.813
- Where?
- About 80 or so miles from here.

22:34.896 --> 22:37.858
- Why'd you leave?
- Lost our water supply.

22:37.941 --> 22:40.485
- So your... your brother is out there too.
- No.

22:40.569 --> 22:43.363
- Where did he go?
- He's dead.

22:47.951 --> 22:51.121
So it's just your wife and your son?
And nobody else?

22:51.204 --> 22:52.664
Just them.

22:55.250 --> 22:59.337
And do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

22:59.421 --> 23:00.672
No.

23:02.132 --> 23:04.342
As soon as people in the city
started getting sick,

23:04.426 --> 23:06.761
we got out,
got as far away as possible.

23:06.845 --> 23:08.906
If there's a grid left, I don't know
who's gonna be on it.

23:08.930 --> 23:12.058
So you're out there driving through 80
miles and you didn't see anything?

23:12.142 --> 23:15.395
No. We didn't see anything or anyone.

23:16.396 --> 23:17.647
We drove at night.

23:17.731 --> 23:20.775
Our truck broke down,
I'd been running it without oil.

23:20.859 --> 23:23.695
When I was by myself, I just stuck
to the woods and I saw nothing.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.450
Look, look in my eyes.

23:29.618 --> 23:31.745
I'm telling you the truth.

23:31.828 --> 23:34.390
I never would've broken in like that
if I thought that the house was occupied,

23:34.414 --> 23:35.832
but I was desperate.

23:36.958 --> 23:38.210
I got no hard feelings at you.

23:38.293 --> 23:40.795
You did what you had to,
you had to protect your family.

23:40.879 --> 23:44.633
But if you can spare some water
for my family, I can trade for it.

23:47.969 --> 23:49.429
Got food.

23:49.513 --> 23:51.973
- How much?
- Got plenty to trade for.

23:52.057 --> 23:53.934
I'm asking how much?

23:55.268 --> 23:57.729
Two goats, six chickens,
some canned food as well.

23:59.648 --> 24:01.358
Are the animals healthy?

24:01.441 --> 24:03.109
Yes, sir.

24:03.193 --> 24:06.238
I promise you,
if you need food, I have it.

24:07.239 --> 24:09.491
My family is all that matters to me.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.078
I know you can understand that.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.331
You're a good person.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.085
You're just trying
to protect your family.

24:22.045 --> 24:23.797
But don't let mine die 'cause of it.

24:24.923 --> 24:26.633
Help <i>me</i>, and I can help <i>you.</i>

24:37.143 --> 24:38.562
Okay.

24:41.106 --> 24:42.482
- Thank you.
- Come on.

24:51.741 --> 24:54.953
<i>- Did he mention the smoke?
- Huh? What?</i>

24:56.162 --> 24:57.831
The smoke from Dad.

25:00.333 --> 25:03.753
I don't... know. Why?

25:05.130 --> 25:08.133
That's probably how he found us.

25:11.886 --> 25:14.598
I think if he does have
a family out there,

25:14.681 --> 25:16.933
that we should consider
bringing them back here.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.936
That's a big jump.
Everything he said could be a lie.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.521
I know that.

25:21.605 --> 25:23.982
I know that you want to believe him.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.442
Is that wrong?

25:25.525 --> 25:28.278
We just gotta be smart about it,
we can't be emotional...

25:28.361 --> 25:30.196
I'm not being emotional.

25:30.280 --> 25:34.284
He knows where we live now.
We can't just let him go.

25:36.786 --> 25:39.956
The more people we have here,
the better we can defend it.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.544
If he found us, other people will too.
They could bring the animals here.

25:44.628 --> 25:47.005
We wouldn't have to just trade for them.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.552
It's the smartest option.

25:54.429 --> 25:57.932
<i>I'm not bringing anyone here
until I know they're not sick.</i>

25:59.517 --> 26:02.771
<i>It took Bud less than a day
to show signs.</i>

26:03.980 --> 26:06.566
<i>I'll wait out three to be certain.</i>

26:08.360 --> 26:10.654
- You be strong.
- Yeah.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.906
<i>Don't go outside
unless you absolutely have to.</i>

26:14.199 --> 26:16.701
<i>And if I, you know, don't come back...</i>

26:18.244 --> 26:19.996
don't come looking for me.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.765
I'm going to try to help you
and your family.

26:38.848 --> 26:40.225
Thank you.

26:43.395 --> 26:47.565
But if you're lying to me,
I will kill you.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.401
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.512
Come on.

27:22.350 --> 27:25.311
- I'll have you ride in the back.
- Okay.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.690
When we're out on the road...

27:29.899 --> 27:32.110
- keep your eyes open for anything.
- All right.

27:42.746 --> 27:45.498
- Are we good?
- We're good.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.460
We're good.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.797
- You give me directions.
- Yep.

28:38.176 --> 28:39.969
Keep going straight!

29:02.033 --> 29:03.451
Stay on this!

30:13.980 --> 30:15.189
Fuck...

30:20.904 --> 30:23.489
Oh, fuck, fuck...

30:31.247 --> 30:32.540
Fuck!

30:43.426 --> 30:44.844
Get your hands down!

30:45.845 --> 30:47.472
Get back!

30:48.473 --> 30:50.683
Get back! Get up!

30:55.813 --> 30:56.814
Wait!

31:02.278 --> 31:04.238
You didn't have to shoot him
right away!

31:04.322 --> 31:05.507
What are you talking about?
They came after us!

31:05.531 --> 31:07.825
They just... Fuck!

31:07.909 --> 31:09.869
- Do you know this guy?
- Huh?

31:09.953 --> 31:11.412
Do you know him?!

31:11.496 --> 31:13.974
You said you traveled 80 miles,
you didn't see a fucking thing!

31:13.998 --> 31:16.042
And we barely get 10
and this fucking happens!

31:16.125 --> 31:18.044
I've never seen this guy
before in my life!

31:18.127 --> 31:20.004
I nearly killed him myself!

31:23.049 --> 31:24.401
Why'd you tell me not to shoot him?

31:24.425 --> 31:26.761
Because we could've got
information from him!

31:26.844 --> 31:29.305
He could've been part
of a bigger group nearby.

31:29.389 --> 31:31.140
Christ!

31:32.141 --> 31:33.893
I ain't lying to you!

31:33.977 --> 31:35.812
Fuck me!

31:37.522 --> 31:38.564
Fuck!

31:45.863 --> 31:47.323
Ah, fuck.

31:47.407 --> 31:48.741
- What's your name?
- Huh?

31:48.825 --> 31:50.702
Your name?
What's your name?

31:50.785 --> 31:51.995
Will.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.955
Okay, Will...

31:54.038 --> 31:57.542
there's a mask and gloves in the bag.
You better put them on.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.919
And wash your fucking hands, too.

32:00.003 --> 32:01.963
Fuck!

32:03.172 --> 32:04.716
Oh, fuck...

32:12.098 --> 32:13.182
All right.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.440
Fuck.

32:22.984 --> 32:26.070
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

32:28.072 --> 32:30.950
I gotta check the other guy.
We gotta be quick.

32:31.034 --> 32:33.161
- Spare in the trunk?
- Yeah.

33:44.941 --> 33:47.443
How you doin'?

33:47.527 --> 33:50.488
Hey, Stanley?

33:50.571 --> 33:52.573
How you doin', buddy?

34:03.459 --> 34:04.544
Mom!

34:04.627 --> 34:07.672
- What?
- Mom, it's... it's Dad!

34:07.755 --> 34:10.257
It's Dad!
He's back, he's okay!

34:12.635 --> 34:14.887
Baby, just... this way,

34:15.888 --> 34:18.933
- Just slow down.
- Hey...

34:19.016 --> 34:20.810
Come on, it's okay.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.355
Hey.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.069
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

34:30.152 --> 34:33.531
Yeah, we had a little trouble.
Talk to you about it later.

34:33.614 --> 34:35.658
Sarah, Travis...

34:35.741 --> 34:37.702
This is Will.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.871
His wife, Kim,
and their son, Andrew.

34:39.954 --> 34:41.706
- Hello.
- Hi.

34:41.789 --> 34:46.210
This is my wife, Sarah,
and my son, Travis.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.795
Hi.

34:47.879 --> 34:49.547
- How you doin'?
- All right.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.174
You doin' okay?

34:51.257 --> 34:52.925
- Yeah.
- Good as can be.

34:55.094 --> 34:56.387
All right, well...

34:56.469 --> 34:58.973
let's get everything unloaded,
and show you the house.

34:59.056 --> 35:01.058
- Maybe have a wash-up.
- Yeah.

35:01.142 --> 35:03.269
- You're gonna be all right.
- Yeah.

35:03.352 --> 35:04.353
We gotta...

35:04.812 --> 35:06.314
When we're inside the house,

35:06.397 --> 35:10.026
the door to the back room
stays closed and locked,

35:10.109 --> 35:11.235
the one you came through?

35:11.319 --> 35:13.613
And the door leading
to the back room

35:13.696 --> 35:15.990
also stays closed and locked,

35:16.073 --> 35:18.534
all the time, the red door.

35:18.618 --> 35:22.079
I have the keys,
the only set.

35:22.163 --> 35:25.541
Or Sarah will have them. Um...

35:25.625 --> 35:27.418
It's the only way
in and out of the house.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.879
Everything else you see
is all boarded up.

35:29.962 --> 35:31.464
- Hm.
- Um...

35:31.547 --> 35:34.592
Most important thing,
we never go out at night,

35:34.675 --> 35:37.845
unless it's an absolute emergency.

35:37.929 --> 35:40.181
And even when we do go out
during the day,

35:40.264 --> 35:43.351
we like to stick to groups of two
just for safety,

35:43.434 --> 35:46.229
you know, collecting
wood or water, whatnot.

35:46.312 --> 35:49.899
Same thing goes
for trips to the bathroom,

35:49.982 --> 35:52.235
which is a ways from the house.

35:52.318 --> 35:56.030
And at nighttime, we use buckets
and empty them...

35:56.113 --> 35:58.866
We can talk about that
another time.

36:01.494 --> 36:02.662
Firearms?

36:02.745 --> 36:07.124
We keep them locked and squared away
in a safe in our room.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.102
We'd like to do the same
with yours, just for now.

36:09.126 --> 36:12.046
- Mm-hmm.
- All right? Thank you.

36:12.129 --> 36:15.549
And meals we eat together,
twice a day,

36:15.633 --> 36:19.345
just for the sake
of food rationing, I guess.

36:19.428 --> 36:22.265
Everybody cleans their own dishes,

36:22.348 --> 36:27.728
and generally puts things away
where they belong.

36:27.812 --> 36:30.147
It's just, like, the way we like
to run things,

36:30.231 --> 36:35.444
and we think it's important
to keep a routine and stay busy.

36:35.528 --> 36:37.780
Um...

36:37.863 --> 36:39.991
Oh, God, I'm sure
I'm forgetting a few things.

36:40.074 --> 36:43.744
There's plenty of time
to work out all the details.

36:43.828 --> 36:44.829
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:45.997 --> 36:48.666
Overload.

36:48.749 --> 36:51.502
- Well, just settle in and...
- Yeah.

36:51.585 --> 36:54.046
we'll get working
in the morning.

36:54.130 --> 36:56.382
- And welcome.
- That's perfect.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.426
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.722
Welcome, buddy.

37:02.805 --> 37:04.348
He's hiding.

37:04.432 --> 37:05.975
Why you hidin'?

37:22.825 --> 37:27.830
...and he is tall and blond...

37:27.913 --> 37:29.081
Ah, yeah?

37:29.165 --> 37:32.418
He's a... He's a surfer.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.962
- He's a surfer?
- That's cute.

37:35.046 --> 37:36.881
Shut up.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.257
There's holes in this story.

37:49.894 --> 37:51.354
Ow!

37:56.025 --> 37:58.319
Ow...

37:58.402 --> 38:01.030
Terra keeps biting my foot.

38:02.239 --> 38:03.324
Ow!

38:03.407 --> 38:05.785
Terra just bit my toe.

38:05.868 --> 38:07.787
Son of a bitch.

38:07.870 --> 38:09.955
Tell him to stop biting my toe.

38:13.417 --> 38:16.379
Maybe you could...
get in the bath.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.381
What?

38:18.464 --> 38:19.965
Maybe you could get in the bath?

38:20.049 --> 38:21.425
Do I smell?

38:21.509 --> 38:23.552
No...

38:27.306 --> 38:30.518
Those subtle hints you drop,
Jesus Christ Almighty.

38:33.896 --> 38:37.400
You don't smell great yourself.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.860
You smell like onion soup.

38:39.944 --> 38:41.904
Like French onion soup.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.572
- That sounds so good.
- I like that.

38:45.699 --> 38:46.742
You look pretty.

38:46.826 --> 38:49.829
I feel like you just say
that when I look the ugliest.

38:49.912 --> 38:51.247
That's when you need it the most.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.457
Thanks!

39:01.382 --> 39:02.925
Yeah...

39:03.008 --> 39:08.597
Bud's property extends
another half mile this way.

39:10.057 --> 39:13.894
I come down here because
I can see down into the valley,

39:13.978 --> 39:15.396
and see if...

39:15.479 --> 39:18.065
you know, every now and then,
if I see anything.

39:18.149 --> 39:20.317
And what you wanna do is also
come down with your legs.

39:20.401 --> 39:23.195
It's gonna feel awkward,
but like you're sitting on the Shitter.

39:23.279 --> 39:25.781
You just sit down on it.

39:25.865 --> 39:27.575
Now, measure it out first,

39:27.658 --> 39:29.368
- make sure you have your distance.
- Okay.

39:29.452 --> 39:31.721
Then when you come over the top,
you bring it straight over,

39:31.745 --> 39:33.998
like tomahawk style, you know?
Not over the shoulder.

39:34.081 --> 39:35.749
- Shoot straight down the middle.
- Yeah.

39:38.878 --> 39:41.630
- Like that?
- Yeah.

39:41.714 --> 39:43.674
Okay. So...

39:47.970 --> 39:48.971
Oh!

39:49.054 --> 39:50.306
You're good.

39:50.389 --> 39:53.434
Thanks.

39:55.269 --> 39:58.314
Can I show you a better form,
so you don't throw your back out?

40:03.777 --> 40:06.280
This... follow this way.

40:14.413 --> 40:17.958
The solar we use, it gives us some power
to charge batteries and whatnot.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.839
I guess the good news is,
we're never going to run out of firewood.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.622
Such a good swimmer!

40:57.623 --> 40:59.583
- Cold water.
- I know.

40:59.667 --> 41:01.085
It's freezing!

41:08.384 --> 41:09.677
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

41:11.303 --> 41:12.471
Yeah.

41:13.472 --> 41:14.473
He's my baby.

41:14.557 --> 41:17.142
- How old is he?
- Five.

41:17.226 --> 41:19.645
You must have had him
when you were pretty young.

41:19.728 --> 41:22.731
Yeah, I guess.
How old's Travis?

41:53.429 --> 41:57.099
We should play "buckets" after this.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.935
You guess whose is whose!

42:02.688 --> 42:04.398
You gotta close your eyes!

45:10.209 --> 45:11.960
- Hey.
- Oh, my God!

45:12.044 --> 45:14.505
I'm sorry.

45:14.588 --> 45:16.089
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

45:16.173 --> 45:17.424
Oh, that's okay.

45:19.718 --> 45:20.886
What are you doing up?

45:20.969 --> 45:22.721
Just can't sleep.

45:24.056 --> 45:25.182
Hmm.

45:25.265 --> 45:28.268
I always used to come into the kitchen
and eat food if I couldn't sleep.

45:28.352 --> 45:30.437
What about you?

45:33.315 --> 45:37.110
I dunno, I... I haven't been able
to sleep for a while.

45:37.194 --> 45:39.988
Just some bad dreams.

45:41.156 --> 45:43.909
You can sit down if you want.
You don't have to just...

45:43.992 --> 45:45.702
stand there.

45:53.752 --> 45:56.380
How long has that been going on?

45:56.463 --> 45:57.673
What?

45:57.756 --> 45:59.424
Not being able to sleep.

46:01.468 --> 46:02.970
Um...

46:03.053 --> 46:04.638
Oh, I don't know.

46:04.721 --> 46:07.641
Oh, yeah, I don't know.
For a while, I guess.

46:10.269 --> 46:12.479
So...

46:12.563 --> 46:13.772
What are we having?

46:17.401 --> 46:19.403
Um...

46:19.486 --> 46:22.489
I'm having bread pudding.

46:23.824 --> 46:26.493
And I want a cupcake.
A red velvet cupcake.

46:28.787 --> 46:30.831
And a cookies and cream cupcake.

46:32.666 --> 46:35.043
And like 10 different kinds
of ice cream.

46:35.127 --> 46:37.129
That sounds so awful.

46:37.212 --> 46:39.339
- You don't like cupcakes?
- Nope.

46:39.423 --> 46:41.258
- You don't like bread pudding?
- Uh-huh.

46:41.341 --> 46:42.467
- Bread pudding?
- No.

46:42.551 --> 46:44.320
- What's wrong with you?
- I know, it's weird.

46:44.344 --> 46:47.889
I don't like cupcakes,
cookies, ice cream...

46:47.973 --> 46:49.057
Wow!

46:49.141 --> 46:50.183
At my birthday parties,

46:50.267 --> 46:52.185
my mom used to make me,
like, Rice Krispy cakes,

46:52.269 --> 46:53.729
instead of actual cakes.

46:53.812 --> 46:57.607
I'm sorry, that's really sad!

46:57.691 --> 47:00.652
I do like...
I do like some kinds of pie.

47:00.736 --> 47:02.612
- Oh, well, that's good.
- Yeah.

47:03.613 --> 47:08.368
Well, great, I'll keep
my disgusting bread pudding

47:08.452 --> 47:10.704
and cupcakes and ice cream
to myself over here.

47:10.787 --> 47:13.206
Keep it over there, please.
Thank you.

47:23.008 --> 47:24.092
How old are you, Travis?

47:25.677 --> 47:28.680
Um... seventeen.

47:28.764 --> 47:30.515
Wow...

47:32.351 --> 47:34.551
I wasn't that much older than
you when I first met Will.

47:36.563 --> 47:37.856
Um...

47:40.984 --> 47:43.779
- I should just probably go to bed.
- Okay.

47:45.155 --> 47:47.157
- Good night, Kim.
- Good night.

47:48.533 --> 47:50.160
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yeah.

47:50.243 --> 47:52.162
Um, yes, I'll see you then.

47:52.245 --> 47:53.455
Cool.

47:58.877 --> 48:01.463
<i>Whew...</i>

48:05.175 --> 48:07.260
All right.

48:07.344 --> 48:08.428
Here.

48:08.512 --> 48:10.514
I'll take this pile down.
That's cool, huh?

48:10.597 --> 48:12.140
Yeah, sure.

48:13.683 --> 48:16.103
- Thanks, Will.
- No problem.

48:29.241 --> 48:30.951
Good people, huh?

48:31.034 --> 48:32.911
Yes.

48:33.954 --> 48:35.372
I like them here.

48:35.455 --> 48:39.167
Well, you just keep it
in perspective, okay?

48:39.251 --> 48:41.503
I don't need to tell you, but...

48:41.586 --> 48:44.631
you can't trust anyone, but family.

48:44.714 --> 48:46.758
As good as they seem.

48:46.842 --> 48:49.010
Just don't forget that, okay?

48:53.390 --> 48:55.100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

49:11.992 --> 49:13.243
Will...

49:14.911 --> 49:17.122
It's okay. Just go inside.

49:18.123 --> 49:21.042
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.

49:21.126 --> 49:22.377
But what's he see?

49:29.593 --> 49:31.928
Go inside, I'll take care of Stanley.

49:32.012 --> 49:33.889
- Hey, hey, stop, stop.
- What's he see?

49:33.972 --> 49:35.557
I said go inside!

49:35.640 --> 49:37.434
Stanley...

49:37.517 --> 49:38.894
Hey, settle down!

49:40.061 --> 49:41.229
Travis!

49:41.313 --> 49:42.856
Stanley!

49:44.357 --> 49:45.484
Travis!

49:52.657 --> 49:54.576
Stanley!

50:02.375 --> 50:04.753
<i>Stanley!</i>

50:34.074 --> 50:35.492
- Travis!
- Right here!

50:35.575 --> 50:36.785
What is it?

50:36.868 --> 50:40.497
Stanley's barking just stopped,
and I heard something up there!

50:40.580 --> 50:41.831
What?

50:46.294 --> 50:48.505
What are you doing?

50:48.588 --> 50:50.340
What the hell are you thinking?

50:50.423 --> 50:53.051
- His barking... his barking just stopped!
- I don't give a shit!

50:53.134 --> 50:54.928
You don't go out
in the woods on your own!

50:55.011 --> 50:56.930
I'm not losing you
over your grandpa's dog!

50:57.013 --> 50:58.413
Travis said
that he heard something.

50:59.349 --> 51:01.226
Where? Where!

51:01.309 --> 51:02.686
- There.
- You see anything, Will?

51:02.769 --> 51:04.563
- Nothing.
- All right.

51:06.147 --> 51:08.650
Let's get back in the house.
Come on, now!

51:08.733 --> 51:11.111
- What about Stanley?
- He knows the woods!

51:11.194 --> 51:13.071
He'll find his way home. Hustle!

51:14.447 --> 51:15.907
Now!

51:17.742 --> 51:19.661
Come on, Will.

51:19.744 --> 51:21.871
Don't you ever fuckin'
do that again.

51:50.233 --> 51:51.776
Yeah?

51:55.780 --> 51:57.324
Hey, buddy.

52:10.211 --> 52:11.504
Hm...

52:20.639 --> 52:22.265
Listen, I wouldn't worry, okay?

52:22.349 --> 52:25.101
I think Stanley's definitely
gonna come home.

52:31.608 --> 52:34.944
I was thinking,
in the meantime...

52:35.028 --> 52:38.323
maybe you and I could
go looking at first light.

52:46.247 --> 52:48.041
So get some rest.

52:51.127 --> 52:53.630
- Thanks, Dad.
- Sure thing.

52:53.713 --> 52:55.048
Night, champ.

53:01.930 --> 53:03.682
Hey, close the door.

53:03.765 --> 53:07.477
This was... this was Bud's room.

53:09.437 --> 53:10.605
Go on, take a seat.

53:10.689 --> 53:12.357
- Over here?
- Yeah.

53:12.440 --> 53:14.609
- There's a light.
- Yeah.

53:14.693 --> 53:16.861
- You got it?
- Got it.

53:19.531 --> 53:20.782
Hey...

53:20.865 --> 53:24.703
I want to thank you again, Paul,
for letting us stay here.

53:24.786 --> 53:26.538
It's really some house you got.

53:26.621 --> 53:30.500
Yeah?
Well, thank <i>you...</i>

53:30.583 --> 53:32.961
for the chickens.

53:33.044 --> 53:34.671
Oh, shit...

53:35.672 --> 53:37.465
No, no, Paul,
you don't gotta open that, man.

53:37.549 --> 53:39.676
Why? You don't?

53:39.759 --> 53:41.678
- I do.
- Well...

53:43.430 --> 53:46.933
- Bud's stash.
- All right.

53:48.101 --> 53:49.894
It's like gold.

53:55.150 --> 53:56.735
Oh, wow, thank you.

53:58.361 --> 54:00.113
<i>- Salud.
- Salud.</i>

54:06.035 --> 54:09.247
Oh, fuck... that's smooth.

54:17.046 --> 54:21.176
So what did <i>you</i> do, Will,

54:21.259 --> 54:23.511
before all this shit?

54:23.595 --> 54:25.138
What? For work?

54:26.264 --> 54:29.601
Uh, little bit of everything, really.
Construction, demolition

54:29.684 --> 54:32.437
and then I was a mechanic
for a little bit.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.521
Oh.

54:35.148 --> 54:37.525
What about you?

54:37.609 --> 54:39.277
I, uh...

54:39.360 --> 54:41.946
I was a teacher...

54:42.030 --> 54:43.948
- Oh, yeah?
- History.

54:44.032 --> 54:45.200
Get outta here.

54:45.283 --> 54:48.286
Yeah, you want to know
all about the Roman Empire?

54:48.369 --> 54:51.080
- I'm your guy.
- Yeah, right.

54:52.791 --> 54:54.751
Did you grow up in the city?

54:54.834 --> 54:56.419
No, I, um...

54:56.503 --> 55:00.256
I went there for Kim.
I chased her there.

55:01.424 --> 55:02.467
Hmm.

55:03.676 --> 55:04.761
Big family?

55:04.844 --> 55:07.972
No, it was just me and my dad.

55:08.056 --> 55:11.476
My dad was a mechanic,
and then I was his only child.

55:14.103 --> 55:16.231
- You're an only child?
- Yeah.

55:19.150 --> 55:20.902
I thought...

55:22.362 --> 55:25.490
Didn't you say that y'all
were living with your brother?

55:25.573 --> 55:30.328
No... yeah, I mean,
it's technically her brother,

55:30.411 --> 55:36.292
but he felt like my brother.
My brother-in-law, you know?

55:38.586 --> 55:39.921
Un-huh...

56:01.818 --> 56:04.070
I think...

56:05.196 --> 56:07.156
I'm gonna...

56:07.240 --> 56:08.491
I'm gonna hit the hay.

57:15.224 --> 57:16.768
Andrew?

57:18.978 --> 57:20.438
Andrew...

57:26.027 --> 57:28.571
Andrew, wake up, buddy.
Come on, wake up.

57:28.655 --> 57:30.281
Wake up.

57:30.365 --> 57:32.492
- Where am I?
- Just in another room, buddy.

57:32.575 --> 57:35.203
It's okay. Come on,
let's get you back to bed.

57:35.286 --> 57:37.747
Okay? Come on.

57:37.830 --> 57:40.708
Take my hand.
All right?

57:41.793 --> 57:43.294
You're okay.

57:48.383 --> 57:49.509
Come on, go to bed.

58:55.366 --> 58:57.160
Dad?

59:02.165 --> 59:03.416
Dad?

59:19.223 --> 59:21.309
Someone's in the house!
Someone's in the house!

59:21.392 --> 59:24.437
- Where?
- Downstairs!

59:24.520 --> 59:26.481
- Where are your mask and gloves?
- In my room.

59:26.564 --> 59:28.691
Go get 'em now! Hurry!

59:38.201 --> 59:39.327
Oh, fuck...

59:43.372 --> 59:45.083
Oh, shit!

59:48.836 --> 59:50.463
Stay back.

59:52.340 --> 59:53.966
Oh...

59:54.050 --> 59:56.636
He... he's messed up.

01:00:03.935 --> 01:00:05.478
What's going on?

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:07.230
- You wait here?
- Yeah, okay.

01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:10.900
Let's go talk in the living room.

01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:13.319
- What's going on?
- Just wait.

01:00:13.402 --> 01:00:16.656
It's Stanley, and he's sick.

01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:18.199
What?

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:19.367
Honey...

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:23.121
take Travis
and get Andrew and Kim.

01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:25.331
Wait in the living room, I'm gonna...

01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:27.041
Will and I are gonna handle it.

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:30.002
- I wanna see him.
- Yeah, well, you can't.

01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:34.108
I mean, how do you even know he's sick?
I mean, I wanna see him.

01:00:34.132 --> 01:00:35.591
No, just stop.

01:00:35.675 --> 01:00:37.385
- I mean, this is bullshit!
- Hey! Hey!

01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:38.511
- Bullshit!
- Hey! Hey!

01:00:38.594 --> 01:00:40.847
Do you want me to be the bad guy?
I will be the bad guy!

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:43.224
You're not going
in the room, all right?

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:45.560
He is fuckin' sick!
Now go to the living room!

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:48.813
Honey, go, take him to the living room.
I am very sorry, Travis.

01:00:48.896 --> 01:00:50.773
Go, please, please.

01:00:50.857 --> 01:00:52.066
- Now.
- Let's go.

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:23.574
<i>I think...</i>

01:02:23.658 --> 01:02:27.286
Will and I should be the only ones
who go outside for a while.

01:02:28.913 --> 01:02:30.790
We don't know what made Stanley sick.

01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:34.669
It could've been an animal,
another person, anything.

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:38.506
Travis...

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:43.761
You didn't go inside the room
before we got there, correct?

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:44.845
Positive.

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:47.348
You just opened the door?
You didn't go in?

01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:52.520
- I didn't touch the door.
- What?

01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:55.815
It was already open.

01:02:55.898 --> 01:02:59.026
The door was open when you got there?

01:02:59.110 --> 01:03:01.988
- Yeah.
- Huh.

01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:04.031
- Then who opened the door?
- Yeah.

01:03:04.115 --> 01:03:06.826
I don't know, I mean...

01:03:08.703 --> 01:03:10.705
- Maybe Andrew?
- What?

01:03:12.707 --> 01:03:15.251
Andrew was asleep in our room.

01:03:15.334 --> 01:03:18.421
- No, he wasn't, he was in grandpa's...
- What are you talking about?

01:03:20.298 --> 01:03:23.551
I... I... I put him in there
before you both woke up.

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.553
Travis, why are we only
hearing about this now?

01:03:25.636 --> 01:03:27.516
I don't know. I mean,
when was I supposed to...?

01:03:27.555 --> 01:03:30.891
Back up. Tell us everything
that happened.

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:38.107
Andrew was in grandpa's room,
and he was having a nightmare,

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:41.027
so I woke him up,
and I brought him to your room.

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:44.196
Then I went to the back hallway,
saw the door open,

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.574
heard something,
and then I woke everyone up.

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:50.244
- Andrew was in the other room?
- Yes.

01:03:54.206 --> 01:03:55.499
Is that true, baby?

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:57.710
I can't remember.

01:03:57.793 --> 01:03:59.920
Did you see Stanley last night?

01:04:00.004 --> 01:04:01.339
- I can't remember...
- Andrew...

01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:04.300
Think real hard and tell Mommy
what you remember.

01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:06.510
I can't remember.

01:04:06.594 --> 01:04:08.888
How can you not remember?

01:04:10.598 --> 01:04:13.517
- Does he sleepwalk?
- No, he doesn't sleepwalk.

01:04:13.601 --> 01:04:15.061
This doesn't make any sense,

01:04:15.144 --> 01:04:19.607
'cause Andrew is barely tall enough
to reach those locks.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.335
You're positive
that the door was already open?

01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:23.986
- Yes!
- How can you be positive?

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:25.756
It was the middle of the night.
You could've been half-asleep.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:28.741
- He said he was sure.
- I was wide awake. I'm positive.

01:04:28.824 --> 01:04:30.177
Look, I'm not saying you're lying, Travis.

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:31.428
I'm just saying
it was the middle of the night.

01:04:31.452 --> 01:04:32.679
Maybe you're not remembering correctly...

01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:34.080
I know what I saw.

01:04:34.163 --> 01:04:36.183
I'm sorry, but the door
was open before I got there.

01:04:36.207 --> 01:04:39.710
All right, then I'm not gonna jump
to any conclusions, but...

01:04:39.794 --> 01:04:42.129
Just to be safe, I think that...

01:04:42.213 --> 01:04:44.048
we all shouldn't interact
for a day or so.

01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:45.424
Dad, I'm sure it's fine.

01:04:45.508 --> 01:04:48.010
Listen, I'm just taking
proper precautions, okay?

01:04:50.096 --> 01:04:52.473
How's that sound?
Does it sound fair to everybody?

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:54.934
Yeah.

01:04:55.017 --> 01:04:58.604
All right, Will, Kim,
get enough food and water,

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:00.731
and take Andrew and go...

01:05:00.815 --> 01:05:03.526
go to your room and stay there
for a while, okay?

01:05:04.527 --> 01:05:07.446
- Now.
- Okay.

01:05:09.323 --> 01:05:13.953
I'm really sorry, but I just think that
we can't take any risks right now.

01:05:14.036 --> 01:05:17.039
Sarah, Travis,
we're gonna do the same.

01:05:17.123 --> 01:05:19.017
- I'll get everything that we...
- I just think that...

01:05:19.041 --> 01:05:20.560
- Just, please...
- We should probably...

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.044
- Just let's go.
- Yeah.

01:05:22.128 --> 01:05:25.548
I think it's better if we stay apart
for a couple of days.

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:29.301
- Okay.
- I'm sure everything's gonna be fine.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:41.355
Travis.

01:05:42.857 --> 01:05:44.316
Come here.

01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:53.451
I just want you to look me in the eye
and tell me that you're telling the truth.

01:05:53.534 --> 01:05:55.619
You didn't touch the door?

01:05:55.703 --> 01:05:57.163
No.

01:06:04.378 --> 01:06:07.256
Okay, did you touch him?

01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:10.926
Andrew?
Did you touch him?

01:06:12.511 --> 01:06:14.138
Yeah, I mean...

01:06:15.556 --> 01:06:16.724
yeah.

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:19.768
I mean, I held his hand, and I...

01:06:19.852 --> 01:06:21.937
and I brought him to his room.

01:06:24.565 --> 01:06:28.068
And you weren't wearing
gloves and mask, right?

01:06:28.152 --> 01:06:29.612
I mean, Dad...

01:06:29.695 --> 01:06:31.535
I mean, why would I wear them
inside the house,

01:06:31.614 --> 01:06:33.032
- you know?
- Okay.

01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:37.870
Tsk. Okay... we're... we're...

01:06:37.953 --> 01:06:40.206
We're all going to wash up,

01:06:40.289 --> 01:06:42.541
and then we're not leaving
this room.

01:06:45.336 --> 01:06:46.420
Okay.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.009
It's okay.

01:11:01.008 --> 01:11:05.387
Look at me, just stay quiet.

01:11:05.471 --> 01:11:09.016
- We need to leave.
- I know.

01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:11.477
I know.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.773
- They're going to hear him.
- I know.

01:11:28.744 --> 01:11:31.205
Mom. Mom.

01:11:31.288 --> 01:11:34.333
- Oh, my God, what is it?
- What's going on?

01:11:34.416 --> 01:11:37.294
It's Andrew.

01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:39.463
- I think he may be sick.
- What?

01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:40.964
What are you talking about?

01:11:41.048 --> 01:11:43.842
I don't know, Andrew was crying
and I was listening in the attic.

01:11:43.926 --> 01:11:47.179
- And they said they need to leave.
- What?

01:11:47.262 --> 01:11:49.681
Andrew was crying and Kim said
they needed to leave.

01:11:49.765 --> 01:11:51.058
Shh.

01:11:57.731 --> 01:11:59.233
Do you hear anything?

01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:03.028
Yeah...

01:12:04.196 --> 01:12:05.572
How are you feeling?

01:12:05.656 --> 01:12:07.115
What?

01:12:07.199 --> 01:12:09.076
Are you feeling okay?

01:12:11.328 --> 01:12:13.330
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

01:12:18.919 --> 01:12:21.338
What do you want to do?

01:12:21.421 --> 01:12:23.465
We don't have many options.

01:12:23.549 --> 01:12:25.217
What does that mean?

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:28.512
If they want to leave, they're gonna want
to take our food and water.

01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:30.389
No, why can't we give them what's fair,

01:12:30.472 --> 01:12:32.033
and take them back
to the house they were at?

01:12:32.057 --> 01:12:34.059
Where do you think
they're going if they run out?

01:12:34.142 --> 01:12:36.979
You haven't seen people
when they get desperate.

01:12:37.062 --> 01:12:39.565
They wouldn't come back here
and put us at risk like that.

01:12:39.648 --> 01:12:41.108
We don't know that.

01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:42.751
- Come on!
- We don't know these people.

01:12:42.818 --> 01:12:44.987
We don't know if any of what they said
is even true.

01:12:46.738 --> 01:12:48.424
<i>This is the man that tried
to break into our house.</i>

01:12:48.448 --> 01:12:50.468
<i>'Cause he was trying to get
food and water for his family.</i>

01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:52.661
<i>Dad would've done the same thing.</i>

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:57.291
<i>I don't think we could take
the chance. I don't think we can risk it.</i>

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.627
You don't get it.

01:13:04.006 --> 01:13:05.465
If they're sick...

01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:08.343
then I am too.

01:13:08.427 --> 01:13:11.555
No, we don't know that, okay?
We don't know that.

01:13:13.307 --> 01:13:14.516
We'll be right back.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.935
I want you to stay here, though.

01:13:17.019 --> 01:13:20.022
You wait here until we get back, okay?

01:13:20.105 --> 01:13:21.732
Okay?

01:13:22.983 --> 01:13:24.693
I love you.

01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:11.990
- Mommy, my mommy!
- Mommy's here. It's okay.

01:14:13.492 --> 01:14:14.618
Hello?

01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:16.036
Yeah?

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:18.288
Is everything okay?

01:14:18.372 --> 01:14:21.750
Oh, yeah, Andrew just had
a nightmare, that's all.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:24.252
I'm sorry to wake you.

01:14:24.336 --> 01:14:26.672
Mind if I come in and check on him?

01:14:26.755 --> 01:14:31.343
Uh... It's not a good time
right now, Paul.

01:14:31.426 --> 01:14:35.097
You said it yourself,
we shouldn't see each other right now.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.349
I just want to make sure
that Andrew's okay.

01:14:37.432 --> 01:14:41.311
I know, its just everything that's been
going on. It's been a lot.

01:14:41.395 --> 01:14:45.857
Yeah, I understand, but I'd feel a whole
lot better if I could just come in,

01:14:45.941 --> 01:14:49.236
and take a look at him, that's all.
Do you think I could do that?

01:14:54.616 --> 01:14:56.368
Will?

01:14:56.451 --> 01:14:58.161
Come on, Will, just...

01:14:59.746 --> 01:15:02.457
Be reasonable, man,
this is my house...

01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:04.418
I invited you here.

01:15:09.965 --> 01:15:12.968
Will, open the fuckin' door,
man, come on!

01:15:13.051 --> 01:15:14.261
Open the door!

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:16.221
Okay, all right.

01:15:16.304 --> 01:15:17.556
All right.

01:15:17.639 --> 01:15:19.391
Keep quiet.

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:27.357
I'm sorry, I just...

01:15:28.984 --> 01:15:31.528
Where's Travis and Sarah?

01:15:31.611 --> 01:15:32.988
They're not...

01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:35.282
No, take your hand off the gun!

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:37.385
- Take your hand off of it right now!
- Will, Will, Will...

01:15:37.409 --> 01:15:40.954
- Take your hand off the gun.
- Okay.

01:15:41.038 --> 01:15:42.497
Come in.

01:15:42.581 --> 01:15:44.124
And shut the door.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.669
- And go to the corner.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:50.464 --> 01:15:52.632
All the way to the corner, Paul,
all the way.

01:15:52.716 --> 01:15:54.235
- All the way, all the way.
- Yeah, all right.

01:15:54.259 --> 01:15:55.719
Where did you get that gun?

01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:57.929
Take your mask...
Why's your mask on?

01:15:58.013 --> 01:15:59.473
Nobody's sick here, take it off!

01:15:59.556 --> 01:16:02.559
Take it off!

01:16:02.642 --> 01:16:03.852
Take the fuckin' mask off!

01:16:10.275 --> 01:16:11.995
Andrew, keep your eyes
closed for me, buddy.

01:16:16.573 --> 01:16:18.450
Okay.

01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:22.704
Listen, Paul, I'm sorry, okay?

01:16:22.788 --> 01:16:25.332
We appreciate everything that you've done,
but we want to leave.

01:16:25.415 --> 01:16:26.792
We're all packed up.

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:28.376
I know how you are,

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:31.338
but if you go near my wife or my kid,
I'll end your fuckin' life.

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:33.507
- Will...
- Listen...

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:34.883
we just want what's fair.

01:16:34.966 --> 01:16:37.052
We want enough food and enough water.

01:16:37.135 --> 01:16:39.596
Then we're gonna go,
and you're never gonna see us again.

01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:41.139
Do you understand?

01:16:42.849 --> 01:16:43.850
Yeah.

01:16:44.976 --> 01:16:47.687
All right, baby, come on.
Keep your eyes closed for me, buddy.

01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:51.233
It's okay.

01:16:51.316 --> 01:16:55.445
- Will, if he's sick...
- Shh, quiet.

01:16:55.529 --> 01:16:56.863
Quiet!

01:17:03.537 --> 01:17:05.247
Okay, all right...

01:17:06.873 --> 01:17:09.000
Stay there.

01:17:09.084 --> 01:17:11.044
All right, come on.

01:17:11.128 --> 01:17:12.671
Just move slowly.

01:17:14.464 --> 01:17:16.216
- All right.
- Walk... Don't!

01:17:16.299 --> 01:17:17.759
Turn around.

01:17:17.843 --> 01:17:20.178
Turn around.

01:17:20.262 --> 01:17:22.139
Go!

01:17:23.849 --> 01:17:25.600
Go to the stairs.

01:17:25.684 --> 01:17:27.644
It's okay, baby, be careful.
Be careful.

01:17:28.687 --> 01:17:30.188
Hands up. Just walk down.

01:17:30.272 --> 01:17:31.857
- Yeah
- All right?

01:17:33.233 --> 01:17:34.901
Okay.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:42.534
Give the gun to Paul.

01:17:44.161 --> 01:17:45.704
Sarah?

01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:48.373
We just wanna leave.

01:17:48.456 --> 01:17:50.584
- Give the gun to Paul.
- I'm sorry, I can't do that.

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:53.336
- Will, what's going on?
- It's okay, baby.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.548
Don't do this.

01:17:56.631 --> 01:18:01.261
Look, Sarah, we can work this out
if we both lower our guns.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:03.430
We just want to leave.

01:18:03.513 --> 01:18:06.349
And we want what's fair,
enough for the both of us,

01:18:06.433 --> 01:18:08.018
and you'll never see us again.

01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:15.317
All right?

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.319
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:18:18.695 --> 01:18:20.655
How about this?

01:18:20.739 --> 01:18:24.910
I'm gonna count to three
and we both lower our guns. Good?

01:18:25.952 --> 01:18:27.204
Yeah.

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:30.665
Okay...

01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:34.252
Will?

01:18:34.336 --> 01:18:35.545
One...

01:18:38.924 --> 01:18:40.175
two...

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.511
three.

01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:51.269
Are we good, Sarah?

01:18:53.563 --> 01:18:55.607
Are we good, Sarah?
I just wanna talk...

01:18:56.775 --> 01:18:58.818
- Paul!
- Wait!

01:18:58.902 --> 01:19:00.070
Kim, run!

01:19:04.241 --> 01:19:05.575
Don't move!

01:19:05.659 --> 01:19:07.035
- Where's Kim?
- I don't know!

01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:08.787
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know!

01:19:11.081 --> 01:19:12.707
See what you did?

01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:14.501
You see what you did?

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:16.670
See what you made me do?

01:19:16.753 --> 01:19:20.423
Stop! Don't!
Please stop!

01:19:20.507 --> 01:19:22.509
Just get in the corner!

01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:24.386
Move! Move!

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.764
Sit down!

01:19:30.934 --> 01:19:32.769
Please, just let us go!

01:19:32.852 --> 01:19:35.605
- I promise if you let us go,
- Stop talking!

01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:38.024
- you'll never see us...
- Stay still!

01:19:38.108 --> 01:19:39.317
Just don't move!

01:19:40.318 --> 01:19:41.528
All right...

01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:43.321
Give me your fuckin' hands!

01:19:43.405 --> 01:19:45.156
- Go away!
- Stop movin'!

01:19:49.077 --> 01:19:51.162
Come on, get up!

01:19:51.246 --> 01:19:52.747
Shit.

01:19:52.831 --> 01:19:54.541
Kim!

01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:57.043
- Oh, fuck!
- Open the door.

01:19:57.127 --> 01:20:00.588
Open the door, Paul.
They're sick.

01:20:05.427 --> 01:20:07.220
- Fuck you, Paul!
- Shut up!

01:20:07.304 --> 01:20:08.471
- Hey!
- Fuck you.

01:20:08.555 --> 01:20:10.515
- Get up, all of you!
- Fuck you!

01:20:10.598 --> 01:20:12.183
Leave him alone!

01:20:14.686 --> 01:20:15.729
Please!

01:20:15.812 --> 01:20:18.023
Let him go, let him go!

01:20:25.697 --> 01:20:29.159
- Please, just let us go!
- Quiet!

01:20:29.242 --> 01:20:31.369
Sarah... Sarah, he's coming to.

01:20:33.913 --> 01:20:36.624
Okay.

01:20:36.708 --> 01:20:37.917
Will, get up.

01:20:38.001 --> 01:20:39.294
- Will...?
- Shh.

01:20:39.377 --> 01:20:41.546
Just be quiet, don't say anything.

01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:46.676
Will, get up!

01:20:48.428 --> 01:20:50.638
- Let 'em go!
- Will, get up!

01:20:50.722 --> 01:20:52.599
Come on, Will...

01:20:54.434 --> 01:20:56.603
Get up, now!

01:21:00.065 --> 01:21:02.817
Don't fuck around, Will.

01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:04.527
Get on your feet now, come on!

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:11.910
You fuckin'...! Fuck you!

01:21:11.993 --> 01:21:13.453
Mom!

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:15.038
Mom! Dad!

01:21:17.457 --> 01:21:18.750
Stop it!

01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:20.502
Stop!

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.174
Stop, please! Stop it!

01:21:26.257 --> 01:21:28.301
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:21:30.136 --> 01:21:31.679
Hey!

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.890
Kim!

01:21:33.973 --> 01:21:35.850
Sarah!

01:21:36.851 --> 01:21:38.311
Stop!

01:21:40.021 --> 01:21:42.816
I said stop!

01:21:45.652 --> 01:21:48.029
No!

01:21:53.993 --> 01:21:57.205
My baby!

01:21:58.998 --> 01:22:02.168
My baby!

01:22:04.546 --> 01:22:05.964
No!

01:22:16.307 --> 01:22:19.227
You killed my baby!

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:25.859
You wanna kill me?

01:22:31.739 --> 01:22:32.782
Kill me!

01:23:00.143 --> 01:23:03.980
Oh, baby... Oh, baby...

01:23:35.887 --> 01:23:37.597
Travis...

01:23:40.934 --> 01:23:42.894
Oh, Travis...

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.562
Mom...

01:25:50.688 --> 01:25:52.357
Oh, Travis.

01:25:53.358 --> 01:25:55.401
Travis, it's okay, sweetie.

01:25:56.903 --> 01:25:58.988
You're gonna be okay.

01:26:01.032 --> 01:26:03.201
It's gonna be okay.

01:26:13.336 --> 01:26:15.296
It's gonna be okay.

01:26:16.547 --> 01:26:18.299
You can let go.

01:26:19.884 --> 01:26:21.719
You can let go.

01:27:03.428 --> 01:27:04.679
Travis...
