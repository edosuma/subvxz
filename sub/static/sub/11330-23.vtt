<i>ADRIAN: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...</i>

00:02.674 --> 00:03.507
What is that?

00:03.542 --> 00:04.942
I thought I'd make it a theme night

00:04.977 --> 00:06.811
since we're getting
married the Fourth of July.

00:06.845 --> 00:08.679
You're going to have sex with Kathleen?

00:08.714 --> 00:09.981
She's not divorced.

00:10.015 --> 00:13.718
You could get caught up in
some legal something or other.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.787
I promise not to be with any
other man for the next week.

00:16.822 --> 00:17.755
Week?

00:19.958 --> 00:22.660
You texted me so, uh, I hope that meant

00:22.694 --> 00:23.828
there's at least some possibility
we can be friends again.

00:26.031 --> 00:28.966
- Alice says she and I can be friends again.
- I told her to text you.

00:29.001 --> 00:31.869
You can't say anything
to Amy about this.

00:31.903 --> 00:32.970
About what?

00:33.005 --> 00:34.939
Anne is gay.

00:35.974 --> 00:39.777
I hope this doesn't get out.

00:39.811 --> 00:43.714
And keep thinking about
transferring to our school.

00:43.749 --> 00:45.650
Please, you guys, I'm begging
you. Please, please, please.

00:45.684 --> 00:46.884
If you're Amy's friends at all,

00:46.918 --> 00:48.819
please don't say anything
about Amy's mother being gay.

00:48.854 --> 00:51.756
Let's just talk about the wedding.

00:51.790 --> 00:54.725
I only told Kathleen that I
thought your mom might be gay.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.861
Do you realize that Mom is
going to come home next week

00:56.895 --> 00:57.795
and everyone is going
to be talking about this?

01:01.667 --> 01:03.868
I don't know. I feel as if
people are looking at me.

01:03.902 --> 01:05.970
They've been looking
at me all week, I think.

01:06.004 --> 01:06.837
Are people looking at me?

01:06.872 --> 01:07.972
No.

01:08.006 --> 01:09.774
I don't think so.

01:09.808 --> 01:11.976
And if they are looking at you,

01:12.010 --> 01:14.912
they're looking at the
three of us, not just you.

01:14.946 --> 01:16.814
Madison, why would they be
looking at the three of us?

01:18.784 --> 01:22.853
They're looking at me. They're
definitely looking at me.

01:22.888 --> 01:25.690
They can't still be talking
about my mother, can they?

01:25.724 --> 01:27.858
No, I don't think so.

01:27.893 --> 01:32.997
No, it must be something else,
you know, something about you.

01:33.031 --> 01:34.832
Oh geez, they're
talking about my wedding.

01:34.866 --> 01:37.735
Oh! Your wedding. Of course!

01:37.769 --> 01:39.904
Yeah, that's probably it.

01:44.042 --> 01:47.712
Just because Amy's mother's
gay doesn't mean she's gay.

01:47.746 --> 01:49.680
Wouldn't that be funny
if she is, though?

01:49.715 --> 01:52.717
I mean, she's the one girl
Ricky chose and she's gay?

01:52.751 --> 01:53.884
It's genetic, you know.

01:53.919 --> 01:57.021
So it really could be true.
Amy Juergens could be gay.

01:57.055 --> 01:59.857
No, that's not true. They
haven't identified a gay gene.

01:59.891 --> 02:03.728
Still, I doubt youould put off marrying
Ricky for another year if you weren't gay.

02:03.762 --> 02:05.663
And the Fourth of
July is such a gay day.

02:07.766 --> 02:11.635
Fireworks. Sparklers. Parades.

02:11.670 --> 02:12.737
Sounds as if you've taken a
couple of stereotypical images

02:12.771 --> 02:14.805
and gone to the limit with them.

02:14.840 --> 02:15.940
Yeah.

02:15.974 --> 02:18.642
On the other hand, I
guess it's possible.

02:24.850 --> 02:28.853
Amy? Gay? No, she's engaged to Ricky.

02:28.887 --> 02:32.823
She's had a baby. She's getting
married. I kind of doubt she's gay.

02:32.858 --> 02:34.825
Her mother had a baby,
her mother was married,

02:34.860 --> 02:35.893
and apparently her mother is gay, so...

02:35.927 --> 02:38.929
So what? Don't people
have something better to do

02:38.964 --> 02:40.598
than talk about who's gay and who's not?

02:40.632 --> 02:42.867
You should be happy they're
not talking about you anymore.

02:44.770 --> 02:46.604
People were talking about me?

02:46.638 --> 02:48.739
Are you kidding? They think I'm gay?

02:48.774 --> 02:50.908
No, no, no, they think you're Dr. Bowman's
son from an affair he had in South Africa.

02:50.942 --> 02:53.677
But I am.

02:53.712 --> 02:56.747
See? Sometimes these rumors
that go around are true.

02:56.782 --> 02:59.650
That's what keeps people
hooked into the gossip.

02:59.684 --> 03:00.618
So Amy definitely could be gay.

03:04.790 --> 03:07.525
I can't believe no matter what happens,

03:07.559 --> 03:10.628
Amy Juergens always ends
up the center of attention.

03:10.662 --> 03:11.595
Well, if you want to be
the center of attention,

03:11.630 --> 03:13.898
I could start a rumor
that your mom's gay.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.834
No one would believe my mother
is gay. She's a flight attendant.

03:16.868 --> 03:17.835
Flight attendant or not, I
think everyone would remember

03:17.869 --> 03:20.838
that your mom had an
affair with Amy's dad.

03:20.872 --> 03:24.542
And? And maybe George Juergens
has that effect on women.

03:24.576 --> 03:26.610
Maybe George Juergens turns women gay.

03:26.645 --> 03:27.812
Then I guess your mom is next.

03:27.846 --> 03:28.579
I want my mom to be gay.

03:28.613 --> 03:30.915
I would welcome that.

03:30.949 --> 03:33.751
Even if she has to go out with
George Juergens for a while first.

03:33.785 --> 03:35.753
At least she'd stop getting married.

03:35.787 --> 03:38.722
Uh-huh. You know, the
legalization of gay marriage

03:38.757 --> 03:39.924
could be just around the corner.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.625
You could end up with two moms.

03:41.660 --> 03:43.627
Great. Two moms.

03:43.662 --> 03:45.863
Better than one mom and
a lying, cheating dad,

03:45.897 --> 03:48.732
or a stepdad who runs away to Africa
and sends back the other dad's kid.

03:48.767 --> 03:51.635
I doubt that would happen again.

03:51.670 --> 03:52.770
I didn't think it could
happen the first time.

03:57.876 --> 03:59.877
Hey, hey, Amy, how are you?

03:59.911 --> 04:02.546
I'm fine.

04:02.581 --> 04:04.849
You know, we can kill this
rumor going around right now.

04:04.883 --> 04:07.651
What rumor? It's not a rumor. It's true.

04:08.553 --> 04:09.253
I knew it.

04:09.287 --> 04:11.622
What do you mean you knew it?

04:11.656 --> 04:12.857
We told you.

04:12.891 --> 04:13.858
What does Ricky think?

04:14.559 --> 04:16.793
He's happy about it.

04:16.827 --> 04:19.596
Yeah. So it'll be the three of you?

04:19.630 --> 04:21.699
Yeah. Yeah.

04:21.733 --> 04:23.834
I think I'd be happy about it. It's...

04:23.869 --> 04:26.537
It's kind of, you know, unconventional.

04:26.571 --> 04:28.572
I thought you thought it was unromantic.

04:28.607 --> 04:30.774
I don't know, I guess it
could be very romantic.

04:30.809 --> 04:32.643
As long as Ricky's going along with it.

04:32.677 --> 04:34.745
Well, yeah, of course he's okay with it.

04:34.779 --> 04:38.716
Hey, I'm not surprised,
I mean, he's Ricky.

04:38.750 --> 04:40.818
Yeah, um, Ethan, I really have to go.

04:40.852 --> 04:41.986
I don't have time for
you right now. I'm sorry.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.688
No, completely understandable.
You're a very busy lady.

04:49.861 --> 04:51.795
I don't think anyone knew how busy.

05:10.179 --> 05:14.662
Well, It's a Private school, and
you right, it's a very good school,

05:14.897 --> 05:17.899
But then again, this
is a very good school.

05:17.933 --> 05:20.735
Ben, you'd be going to a
new school your senior year.

05:20.769 --> 05:22.036
You really want to do that?

05:22.071 --> 05:24.839
What if you and Dylan break up?

05:24.874 --> 05:27.742
We're not going to
break up. We're in love.

05:27.776 --> 05:31.045
I can get you an application
going to be the one I'm not

05:31.080 --> 05:35.783
to approach your father
I'm not supportive.

05:35.818 --> 05:36.918
You don't have to be supportive.

05:36.952 --> 05:39.053
He has to be supportive.
He's got to pay the tuition.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.823
He even has to pay
for you to apply there.

05:41.857 --> 05:43.725
And I think it's about $1,200.

05:43.759 --> 05:45.026
Really? Really.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.095
(SIGHS)

05:53.102 --> 05:54.903
What's he doing in there, anyway?

05:54.937 --> 05:56.905
What do you think he's doing?
He's trying to transfer.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.673
He's not going to transfer.

05:58.707 --> 06:01.910
No. He is. If he gets accepted, he is.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.746
But we're all friends
again, the three of us.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.681
It's the three of us against the world.

06:06.715 --> 06:08.016
The three of us plus one. Dylan.

06:08.050 --> 06:09.817
And it's the two of us
against the two of them,

06:09.852 --> 06:10.919
which really isn't a friendship,

06:10.953 --> 06:11.853
or not the friendship we had, anyway.

06:11.887 --> 06:14.989
But you and I are friends.

06:15.024 --> 06:16.724
And I'm really happy about that.

06:16.759 --> 06:17.892
Me too, Alice.

06:17.894 --> 06:19.928
You know what I was thinking,

06:19.962 --> 06:24.032
I mean, it's not the ideal,
but you and I could be

06:24.066 --> 06:25.033
friends with benefits.

06:25.067 --> 06:27.769
No. No, no, no. We are
not going to go there.

06:27.803 --> 06:30.805
We've been there. But
we're just friends now.

06:30.839 --> 06:31.940
Oh, we're still going to be friends.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.741
I can't.

06:33.776 --> 06:34.876
You can if you want.
That's what I'm saying.

06:34.910 --> 06:36.911
Don't make me hurt your feelings, Alice.

06:36.946 --> 06:38.713
You're not going to hurt my feelings.

06:38.747 --> 06:40.748
Good. Because I can't.

06:40.783 --> 06:42.850
You can.

06:42.885 --> 06:44.886
I don't think the two of us
should do that with each other.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.988
How about with someone else?

06:47.022 --> 06:50.725
What if there's someone else
that I want to have sex with?

06:50.759 --> 06:51.926
You mean like another girl?

06:51.961 --> 06:56.064
What! No! Just because Amy's
in school is gay.every girl

06:56.098 --> 06:57.966
No, but it certainly explains a lot.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.934
I would never have sex with a girl.

06:59.969 --> 07:04.772
They're dramatic, they're
fickle, they're emotional,

07:04.807 --> 07:06.774
and it would be like
having sex with myself.

07:06.809 --> 07:07.976
I just don't get it.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.812
See, this is what I like
about our being friends.

07:10.846 --> 07:13.748
I like hearing your thoughts
about not having sex with women.

07:13.782 --> 07:14.649
This is a very stimulating conversation.

07:14.683 --> 07:16.017
Shut up, Hank.

07:21.757 --> 07:22.924
So you're not going
out with Jack tonight?

07:22.958 --> 07:25.793
No. I told him I don't
even want to be friends.

07:25.828 --> 07:27.795
He just wants to have
wanted.at's all he's ever

07:27.830 --> 07:29.764
I think he wants more than that.

07:29.798 --> 07:31.032
I think he wants a relationship.

07:31.066 --> 07:32.767
Yeah. Well, I thought I did, too,

07:32.801 --> 07:33.701
but it's just too much trouble to be

07:33.736 --> 07:35.970
in a relationship
with a guy at this age.

07:36.005 --> 07:40.675
What about a girl at this age?

07:40.709 --> 07:43.845
(SCOFFS) I am not interested in
having a relationship with a woman,

07:43.879 --> 07:45.747
especially not a sexual relationship.

07:45.781 --> 07:48.916
And before you say anything,
I have nothing against lesbians

07:48.951 --> 07:51.919
or gays or bis or trans or

07:51.954 --> 07:53.855
anyone questioning what they are.

07:53.889 --> 07:56.991
I just know what I am. And I
know I am not interested in women.

07:58.694 --> 07:58.726
What?

08:02.898 --> 08:04.999
Are you thinking about
having sex with a woman?

08:05.034 --> 08:07.902
Well, I can't say I've never thought
about having sex with a woman.

08:07.936 --> 08:10.838
I've thought about
kissing a woman, anyway.

08:11.006 --> 08:12.640
Who?

08:12.674 --> 08:13.708
I don't know.

08:13.742 --> 08:14.776
Not me?

08:14.810 --> 08:16.711
You? No! Of course not you.

08:16.745 --> 08:19.781
Why not me? I've thought
about kissing you!

08:19.815 --> 08:23.951
(STAMMERING) Oh, my God, I did
not say that. I did not mean that.

08:23.986 --> 08:26.888
I have never thought about
kissing you or having sex with you.

08:26.922 --> 08:28.723
All these rumors about Amy...

08:28.757 --> 08:32.693
They're really confusing and
upsetting. I can't think straight.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.663
I did not mean "straight" straight.

08:35.697 --> 08:35.730
I have to go.

Hi.

08:57.986 --> 09:00.922
Hi. I left my stupid keys in my locker.

09:00.956 --> 09:02.924
I have to pick up John from
the nursery and then go home

09:02.958 --> 09:05.993
to study for my history
final. I'm not working today.

09:06.028 --> 09:08.863
Are you just in a hurry to get home
because of all the talk at school?

09:08.897 --> 09:11.966
No, I don't care what people
think about my wedding.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.735
I don't know why everyone
is so weirded out by me

09:14.770 --> 09:16.904
and Ricky getting married
on the Fourth of July.

09:16.939 --> 09:20.708
I don't know, but you have heard
the rumors going around school?

09:20.742 --> 09:23.678
No, but I know that everyone is
talking about my wedding plans.

09:23.712 --> 09:25.913
They were talking about
your wedding plans and

09:25.948 --> 09:28.783
then they were talking
about your mother.

09:28.817 --> 09:30.852
Oh, please. That was ridiculous.

09:30.886 --> 09:33.921
My father told Grace's mother
that he thinks my mother is gay

09:33.956 --> 09:37.792
just so the two of them wouldn't
feel guilty about seeing each other.

09:37.826 --> 09:39.827
Oh. I didn't know they
were seeing each other.

09:39.862 --> 09:43.998
I hope no one knows because my mother
is not going to be too happy about it,

09:44.032 --> 09:46.767
especially if she hears
it from someone else.

09:46.802 --> 09:49.670
You know how she is. She hates getting
information after everyone else has it.

09:49.705 --> 09:52.673
Yeah, which is why I thought
I might mention this to you.

09:52.708 --> 09:55.009
Ben, my mother is not gay, okay?

09:55.043 --> 09:57.812
Everyone knows that she's not gay,
and even if she is gay, who cares?

09:57.846 --> 10:01.816
I don't care. I would hope
that she's not because obviously

10:01.850 --> 10:03.985
that would simplify my life if her
and my dad eventually got back together

10:04.019 --> 10:06.721
but hey, whatever.

10:06.755 --> 10:11.025
So it was only a rumor. But now that
rumor has taken a turn in your direction.

10:11.059 --> 10:12.693
What? What do you mean?

10:14.062 --> 10:16.998
Oh, wait. Are people actually
talking about my mother

10:17.032 --> 10:19.834
coming to my wedding with
another woman or something?

10:19.868 --> 10:21.836
They're talking about you coming to your
wedding with another woman or something.

10:25.707 --> 10:28.743
People are saying that you're gay
because, well, your mother is gay.

10:28.777 --> 10:31.045
(LAUGHS) No, they're not.

10:31.079 --> 10:32.813
No, they are. Here...

10:34.816 --> 10:40.988
(SIGHS)

10:41.023 --> 10:43.991
Yeah, sorry to be the one to tell you.

10:45.961 --> 10:48.829
Wait, if people think I'm
gay because my mother is gay,

10:48.864 --> 10:53.768
which she's not, then people must think
that Ricky is gay because his mother is gay.

10:53.802 --> 10:54.202
No, not necessarily.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.772
Are you sure?

10:57.806 --> 10:59.740
I mean, maybe that's why everyone thinks
the Fourth of July wedding is so insane,

10:59.775 --> 11:00.975
because we're both gay.

11:01.009 --> 11:03.945
No. Not both. Just you.

11:15.568 --> 11:15.568
+

11:20.433 --> 11:21.667
What's up? Going out with Dylan?

11:21.701 --> 11:23.502
Not tonight.

11:23.536 --> 11:26.505
Tonight I've got to study, got
that history final coming up

11:26.539 --> 11:28.641
and I'm hoping to ace
it, go out with a bang.

11:28.675 --> 11:31.610
Summer school is almost over.

11:31.645 --> 11:36.448
And you know, this time next year, I'll
be getting ready to go off to college.

11:36.483 --> 11:38.617
You hope. Yeah, I do hope.

11:38.652 --> 11:40.753
I'm going to do everything I can to
get into the best school possible.

11:40.787 --> 11:41.453
What schools are you going to go for?

11:41.488 --> 11:44.556
Funny you should ask that.

11:44.591 --> 11:46.558
I was just talking to the counselor today
about what colleges would be best for me,

11:46.593 --> 11:52.531
and I was slightly disappointed at
the colleges she was recommending.

11:52.565 --> 11:56.635
Really? But your grades are
good and your SATs were good

11:56.670 --> 11:58.437
and you still got time
to take those again.

11:58.471 --> 12:01.674
Yeah, it's just that, well...

12:01.708 --> 12:04.576
Our high school is rated
very highly academically,

12:04.611 --> 12:05.744
but it just doesn't have that

12:05.779 --> 12:09.715
sparkle that some of
the private schools have.

12:09.749 --> 12:13.619
Let me guess. Like Dylan's school.

12:13.653 --> 12:16.755
Please, Dad, please.
Just let me transfer.

12:16.790 --> 12:20.693
Look, I know it's a lot of
money, it's $32,000, but...

12:20.727 --> 12:22.561
(LAUGHS)

12:22.595 --> 12:24.697
Thirty-two grand? Are you kidding me?

12:24.731 --> 12:29.535
You have the money and what's more important
than investing in your child's education?

12:29.569 --> 12:32.571
Do you have any idea
how much I pay in taxes?

12:32.605 --> 12:35.574
I pay well beyond 50%
of my income in taxes!

12:35.608 --> 12:37.743
And I don't try to avoid it.

12:37.777 --> 12:42.448
I can pay, I pay, and a large percentage
of what I pay goes for public education.

12:42.482 --> 12:47.486
I am not going to pay 32 grand
on top of what I pay in taxes

12:47.520 --> 12:50.589
just so you can go make out with
your girlfriend your senior year.

12:50.623 --> 12:54.493
Because I know you're not
that interested in academics.

12:54.527 --> 12:56.595
You're going to finish at
the school where you started.

12:58.598 --> 13:01.433
Just keep an open mind about it.

13:01.468 --> 13:02.501
I don't have an open mind about this.

13:02.802 --> 13:06.405
They have uniforms.

13:06.439 --> 13:09.575
You know how much I could save on
clothes by wearing a uniform every day?

13:09.609 --> 13:12.478
What kind of an argument is that?

13:12.512 --> 13:15.547
They got uniforms in prison,
too. You want to go to prison?

13:15.582 --> 13:18.784
You know how much money
that would save me?

13:18.818 --> 13:21.720
Thirty-two grand a year, to
start with? (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

13:21.755 --> 13:24.790
Dad, Dad, come on, just
consider it, please?

13:24.824 --> 13:25.624
No.

13:25.658 --> 13:29.728
Okay, well, I've planted the seed

13:29.763 --> 13:31.563
and now I'll just let it grow.

13:31.598 --> 13:32.631
Get out of here.

13:32.665 --> 13:33.732
Okay, okay. Good night.

13:37.837 --> 13:39.605
Thirty-two grand.

13:40.673 --> 13:42.574
Ha.

13:45.845 --> 13:48.814
Well, all the other girls
are getting bunk beds.

13:48.848 --> 13:51.617
But you don't have a roommate.

13:51.651 --> 13:54.586
Leo got you a private dorm room, so
you're not restricted to a bunk bed.

13:54.621 --> 14:01.560
Betty, we could do something that
makes this more of a gathering place.

14:01.594 --> 14:06.498
Like an antique recamier
with a tufted back

14:06.533 --> 14:11.637
and a couple of Napoleon
chairs, but with a bold fabric.

14:11.671 --> 14:14.706
Then we'll mix in some Lucite
tables in the French style

14:14.741 --> 14:16.475
to get some modern pieces.

14:16.509 --> 14:21.413
Leo says there's no budget on
this one. Do whatever you want.

14:21.448 --> 14:24.516
Yeah, that's because
he's feeling guilty about

14:24.551 --> 14:26.685
thinking about having
a kid with Camille.

14:26.719 --> 14:28.754
He says he doesn't want one

14:28.788 --> 14:32.491
but since he gives me
everything that I want

14:32.525 --> 14:34.726
I bet you he does the same for her.

14:34.761 --> 14:37.563
They can borrow any one of my five
children any time they feel the want.

14:37.597 --> 14:41.700
Oh, dear. . Speaking of which,
we need to hurry this up.

14:41.734 --> 14:43.535
I've got a teacher-parent meeting

14:43.570 --> 14:46.472
and homework and on top of that,

14:46.506 --> 14:48.740
Anne is coming back late
tonight or tomorrow morning

14:48.775 --> 14:51.510
and I've got a ton of
business to go over with her

14:51.544 --> 14:54.546
and I wasn't expecting her back.

14:54.581 --> 14:55.581
Is she coming back
early because Amy is gay?

14:58.585 --> 15:00.486
Amy Juergens is gay?

15:00.520 --> 15:02.721
Yeah, but she's getting married
to Ricky on the Fourth of July.

15:02.755 --> 15:05.591
Oh, good choice. It's
my favorite holiday.

15:05.625 --> 15:08.760
But are you sure about this, Betty?

15:08.795 --> 15:12.698
Oh, yeah. I heard it
from the kids at school,

15:12.732 --> 15:15.767
they text me all the time.

15:15.802 --> 15:19.505
And you know what? It makes
sense since her mother is gay.

15:20.507 --> 15:21.006
Her mother-in-law.
Nora.

15:21.040 --> 15:24.510
No, her mother. Anne.

15:24.777 --> 15:26.778
Anne is gay.

15:28.648 --> 15:29.548
Oh.

15:30.683 --> 15:32.551
Have you ever thought about being gay?

15:42.829 --> 15:45.631
Hello.

15:45.665 --> 15:47.799
Oh, no, I thought you two
were going out for the night.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.735
No, you didn't.

15:49.769 --> 15:51.803
Hey, Adrian. Omar.

15:51.838 --> 15:54.506
I didn't know you two were
seeing each other again.

15:54.541 --> 15:55.641
I didn't either. (LAUGHS)

15:57.477 --> 15:58.644
It's not going to prove anything.

16:04.617 --> 16:07.419
What does that mean? This is
"not going to prove anything."

16:07.453 --> 16:09.488
Oh, I don't know. I
told her I missed you.

16:09.522 --> 16:12.591
And this proves it, if you ask me.

16:12.625 --> 16:13.759
I was surprised to hear from you.

16:13.793 --> 16:15.594
Really? Yeah.

16:17.764 --> 16:19.731
I don't like her using him.

16:19.766 --> 16:22.668
I don't know if she's using
him or if he's using her.

16:22.702 --> 16:24.803
How would he be using her?

16:24.837 --> 16:27.573
I think he's seeing Raven again, but
Raven is still seeing other guys, so...

16:27.607 --> 16:28.674
So he's seeing Grace.

16:28.708 --> 16:30.642
Don't say anything.
That's their business.

16:30.677 --> 16:32.544
And besides, isn't
she still seeing Jack?

16:32.579 --> 16:33.779
No, she's not seeing Jack.

16:33.813 --> 16:35.814
She's angry with Jack
because Jack can't tell her

16:35.848 --> 16:38.684
that he's absolutely
certain he would marry her.

16:38.718 --> 16:41.753
Well, at this point, maybe
Jack should know that.

16:41.788 --> 16:44.656
I mean, I know that about you.

16:53.633 --> 16:54.833
You want to go in my bedroom?

16:54.867 --> 16:57.436
I just got here. Let me catch my breath.

16:57.470 --> 16:58.770
I think we should do it. I
think we've waited long enough.

16:58.805 --> 16:59.504
Slow down, Grace, what's your hurry?

17:02.575 --> 17:03.809
You don't want to have sex with me?

17:03.843 --> 17:05.611
I think you know that I'm
really only comfortable with sex

17:05.645 --> 17:07.479
when it's within an
exclusive relationship.

17:07.512 --> 17:08.646
Well, I can give you that.

17:08.681 --> 17:11.782
Well, I can't exactly
give you that right now.

17:11.818 --> 17:12.784
I've been out a couple
of times with Raven.

17:12.819 --> 17:14.453
Okay, well just don't
go out with her again.

17:14.487 --> 17:16.555
It's not really that simple.

17:16.589 --> 17:17.422
It is! It is that simple!

17:17.457 --> 17:20.459
Grace, you cheated on me.

17:20.492 --> 17:22.794
I really liked you, no, I
was even in love with you,

17:22.829 --> 17:25.763
and you cheated on me.

17:25.798 --> 17:27.633
It seems to me you're
more than a little fickle,

17:27.666 --> 17:29.434
so excuse me if I don't just
jump back into bed with you.

17:29.469 --> 17:30.769
You're just scared Raven
won't go out with you anymore.

17:30.803 --> 17:32.738
Yeah.

17:34.607 --> 17:36.808
Fine. Just go home.

17:36.843 --> 17:38.644
(SCOFFS)

17:38.678 --> 17:40.679
Well, all right.

17:40.713 --> 17:43.515
I'm sorry I didn't fit into whatever
little scheme you have going on here.

17:43.549 --> 17:44.683
Me too.

17:44.717 --> 17:45.817
Good night.

17:45.852 --> 17:46.852
Good night.

17:54.694 --> 17:55.060
Ugh!

17:55.094 --> 17:56.695
I hate men!

17:56.729 --> 18:00.632
No! I didn't mean that.
What I meant was...

18:00.667 --> 18:02.534
Never mind, if you're listening.

18:07.540 --> 18:08.740
What is going on with her?

18:08.775 --> 18:11.777
She's all paranoid.

18:11.811 --> 18:14.479
We were talking about whether
or not Amy Juergens is gay,

18:14.514 --> 18:16.481
which I think she is,

18:16.516 --> 18:21.787
and I said I can't deny that
I've thought about kissing a girl

18:21.821 --> 18:23.755
and Grace said she's attracted to me.

18:23.790 --> 18:26.625
And ever since then, she's
been trying to take it back.

18:28.494 --> 18:30.562
Want to call her in here?

18:30.596 --> 18:32.631
(LAUGHS) I'm just
kidding. I'm not into that.

18:32.665 --> 18:34.766
But I can't deny I've thought about it.

18:34.801 --> 18:35.467
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

18:39.672 --> 18:44.509
Just because you think about doing
something doesn't mean you'd actually do it.

18:44.544 --> 18:46.611
Or that you really want to do it.

18:46.646 --> 18:49.481
It just means you're thinking about it
or you thought about it. It means nothing.

18:49.515 --> 18:50.782
Are you trying to convince
me or yourself of that?

18:50.817 --> 18:51.850
You.

19:01.594 --> 19:03.428
Are you kidding me?

19:03.463 --> 19:04.596
What? What's going on?

19:04.630 --> 19:06.698
Guys, can you please
stop? I'm trying to study.

19:06.733 --> 19:08.700
Is that bothering you?

19:08.735 --> 19:10.702
It's not bothering you? It's probably
bothering the whole neighborhood!

19:10.737 --> 19:12.604
Yeah, but how else is he going to learn?

19:12.638 --> 19:14.573
Well, he doesn't have to learn tonight!

19:14.607 --> 19:16.508
Tonight I have to study for a test.

19:16.542 --> 19:19.444
Come on, he'll be in bed
in another 20 minutes.

19:19.479 --> 19:22.380
I can't take another 20 minutes of
that. I can't take another two minutes.

19:22.415 --> 19:23.648
Why are you in such a bad mood?

19:23.683 --> 19:24.583
Something happen at school today?

19:24.617 --> 19:27.552
Yeah, something always
happens at school.

19:27.587 --> 19:29.421
That's why I want to pass this test,

19:29.455 --> 19:31.523
get through my senior year
and get the hell out of school.

19:31.557 --> 19:33.625
Wow. "Get the hell out"? Must
have been a big something.

19:36.429 --> 19:37.696
You know, don't you?

19:37.730 --> 19:40.665
I suspected all along. Otherwise,
you'd marry me right away.

19:40.700 --> 19:42.701
You know what? That's not funny.

19:42.735 --> 19:43.668
I can't believe people think I'm gay.

19:43.703 --> 19:46.772
Oh, come on, laugh it
off. It's ridiculous.

19:46.806 --> 19:49.574
You're not gay just because
your mother is gay. I'm not gay.

19:49.609 --> 19:51.409
No one thinks you're gay. That's
why you can laugh about it.

19:51.444 --> 19:52.778
And my mother is not gay.

19:52.812 --> 19:53.645
Maybe we should move the wedding up.

19:53.679 --> 19:56.481
What's another gay day to get married?

19:56.516 --> 19:57.682
What?

19:57.717 --> 19:59.484
Yeah, people think that the
Fourth of July is some kind of

19:59.519 --> 20:00.685
high holy day for gay marriage.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.754
Since when?

20:02.789 --> 20:05.690
Since you set the date, I guess.

20:05.725 --> 20:07.559
Okay, that's not funny
either. None of this is funny.

20:09.695 --> 20:10.428
It's all funny.

20:10.463 --> 20:11.596
(JOHN PLAYING DRUMS)

20:16.736 --> 20:19.704
Come on, buddy, jam session's over.

20:24.710 --> 20:27.612
I am not gay. I am deeply heterosexual.

20:27.647 --> 20:28.547
Gay.

20:30.616 --> 20:32.784
Must be going around
gaycare. I mean, daycare.

+

20:42.543 --> 20:44.510
(SIGHS)

20:44.545 --> 20:47.580
I wonder how long it's gonna
take them to get through customs.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.415
You think they got stuck in customs?

20:49.449 --> 20:52.552
I don't know. Depends on
how much stuff they bought.

20:52.586 --> 20:55.488
Oh, but I think they'll just
let us know when they land.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.456
They haven't even landed yet.

20:57.491 --> 21:00.293
By the way, I got all my
stuff out of Ashley's room.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.594
You didn't have to do that.
She'll be out of here in a week.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.297
You can keep the room. Yeah, we'll see.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.632
Oh, and I put fresh sheets on
Amy's bed so you can sleep in there.

21:06.667 --> 21:09.502
You let Anne have your room tonight.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.637
They've been traveling all
day. They're going to be tired.

21:11.672 --> 21:15.341
Yeah, yeah, or I can sleep on the
couch and you can have Amy's room.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.476
You don't think they
heard that, you know...

21:17.511 --> 21:18.544
That Amy is gay?

21:18.579 --> 21:21.414
Amy? You mean Anne, don't you?

21:21.448 --> 21:23.549
Nope, I mean Amy, that's the latest.

21:23.584 --> 21:24.550
But Amy's getting married.

21:24.585 --> 21:28.387
On a gay holiday and
her mother is gay. Yay!

21:29.423 --> 21:30.656
Oh! You lose.

21:30.691 --> 21:32.558
So, wait, you're saying
you know Anne's gay?

21:32.593 --> 21:34.627
No, I'm not saying that.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.396
She better be gay or I'm up
the creek without a paddle.

21:37.431 --> 21:38.397
Are you going to tell
her about Kathleen?

21:38.432 --> 21:40.433
You mean that I told
Kathleen that she's gay?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.401
No, I meant are you going to tell
Anne that you're seeing Kathleen

21:42.436 --> 21:44.337
and that you told her she's gay.

21:44.371 --> 21:48.608
Nah, she'll have enough to worry
about when she finds out Amy is gay.

21:48.642 --> 21:51.544
Wait. Did you say the Fourth
of July is a gay holiday?

21:51.578 --> 21:53.546
Well, it wasn't.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.549
But apparently someone at the high
school started that rumor and now it is.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.551
Teenagers.

21:58.585 --> 22:01.554
What's gay about the
Fourth of July? Hot dogs?

22:01.588 --> 22:04.423
I don't know. I have never
heard that one before.

22:05.559 --> 22:07.360
Um, could it be volleyball?

22:09.429 --> 22:11.530
Uncle Sam? Uncle Sam is not gay.

22:11.565 --> 22:15.635
Plenty flamboyant clothing
he's wearing there.

22:15.669 --> 22:19.272
And hey, what does gay look like?

22:19.306 --> 22:20.306
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

22:22.309 --> 22:24.443
Like that. Ashley's gay friend.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.417
Hey, long time, no see. How you doing?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.552
Come on in.

22:33.587 --> 22:36.555
Griffin, Nora. Nora, Griffin.

22:36.590 --> 22:39.425
You're both gay, just so you both know.

22:39.459 --> 22:42.595
Well, I never had any doubts about me,
anyway, but I don't usually introduce myself

22:42.629 --> 22:44.397
starting with my sexual identity.

22:44.431 --> 22:47.333
Ignore him. He's just ignorant.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.601
Nice to meet you. You
want to play cards?

22:48.635 --> 22:50.336
Do gay men play poker?

22:50.370 --> 22:51.637
Do straight men pee in the woods?

22:51.672 --> 22:53.339
What? Funny. I like you.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.341
Deal me in.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.842
What does that mean?

22:56.877 --> 23:00.246
It means gay men do everything
straight men do except sleep with women.

23:00.280 --> 23:04.383
And sometimes we do that too,
now that I think about it.

23:04.418 --> 23:08.421
I am so happy to have some relief
here. I can't even tell you.

23:08.455 --> 23:11.524
I just thought I'd stop by, say hello.

23:11.558 --> 23:12.558
Wait for Ashley to get home?

23:12.592 --> 23:14.460
Ashley's coming home? Tonight?

23:14.494 --> 23:16.529
If you didn't know she's coming
home, why'd you stop by to say hello?

23:16.563 --> 23:17.363
Oh, let me guess.

23:18.365 --> 23:21.334
Because Amy's gay?

23:21.368 --> 23:21.701
You thought George might
need some help with that?

23:21.735 --> 23:23.469
Amy's gay?

23:26.373 --> 23:29.342
Yeah, I might have heard that.

23:29.376 --> 23:32.311
In addition to mentioning that
I'm gay in his introduction,

23:32.346 --> 23:35.481
maybe George should have
mentioned that I am Ricky's mom

23:35.515 --> 23:40.386
and I'm going to be Amy's
mother-in-law, because Amy is not gay.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.320
So it's just Anne?

23:41.355 --> 23:44.423
How did you know about that?

23:44.458 --> 23:48.561
I'll tell you how, because some bigmouth
said something about it to someone

23:48.595 --> 23:53.366
and she said something about it to
her daughter and so on and so forth.

23:53.400 --> 23:53.799
You think Anne knows?

23:53.834 --> 23:56.168
That she's gay?

23:56.203 --> 23:57.036
That people are saying that she's gay.

23:57.070 --> 24:00.306
Not people! Your
people! Your girlfriend!

24:00.340 --> 24:02.508
And Anne's not going to be too
happy about that. Bet on it.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.276
You have a girlfriend?

24:04.311 --> 24:05.544
I might.

24:05.579 --> 24:08.247
I'm surprised any woman would
go out with you at this point.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.482
What point?

24:09.516 --> 24:10.483
Oh, you've been hit, too.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.485
Hit?

24:12.519 --> 24:13.386
By the rumors.

24:13.420 --> 24:17.323
Oh, I can't wait.
What is it? What is it?

24:17.357 --> 24:20.493
Oh, you'll like this.
Apparently, you turn women gay.

24:20.527 --> 24:23.195
No, I don't!

24:23.230 --> 24:25.331
Oh! (LAUGHS)

24:25.365 --> 24:26.532
I don't. There's no turning.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.434
You are or you aren't
or you're figuring it out

24:28.468 --> 24:30.369
or emerging or evolving or whatever.

24:30.404 --> 24:32.405
You've been reading again, haven't you?

24:32.439 --> 24:33.539
Just deal.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.474
(SIGHS)

24:37.277 --> 24:38.277
(RINGING)

24:46.253 --> 24:47.219
Hi, Mom.

24:47.254 --> 24:50.356
Mmm. Hey, I made your
favorite cake tonight.

24:50.390 --> 24:52.291
I thought you said you might drop by.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.392
(SIGHS) I wish I had.

24:53.427 --> 24:53.759
Well, it's not too late.

24:53.794 --> 24:55.594
No, it is.

24:55.629 --> 24:57.363
Are you okay?

24:57.397 --> 24:59.532
Mom, do we have any...

25:01.201 --> 25:02.535
Gay genes?

25:02.569 --> 25:06.238
I don't know, what kind
of jeans are gay jeans?

25:06.273 --> 25:07.406
Are there gay jeans?

25:07.441 --> 25:10.443
I don't know, aren't there?
That's what I've heard.

25:10.477 --> 25:13.512
Honey, I don't think a pair
of jeans can make you gay.

25:13.547 --> 25:15.514
Unless they're really, really tight.

25:15.549 --> 25:16.549
(CHUCKLES)

25:18.318 --> 25:19.552
That was a joke.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.554
No, I mean like genes as in genetics.

25:21.588 --> 25:24.457
Yes, I realize that now.

25:24.491 --> 25:26.392
Are you asking because kids
at school are saying Amy is gay

25:26.426 --> 25:30.196
or because I told you that Anne is gay?

25:30.230 --> 25:32.231
How do you know that kids at
school are saying that Amy is gay?

25:32.265 --> 25:34.500
Because now I have a kid in
the house who tells me things.

25:34.534 --> 25:35.401
Fine. Go talk to him, then.

25:35.435 --> 25:38.437
No, honey, talk to me, what's going on?

25:39.339 --> 25:40.339
Nothing.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.408
Really, Grace, come over.

25:42.442 --> 25:44.443
I've eaten half the cake
waiting for George to call

25:44.478 --> 25:46.479
to let me know if I'm off the hook,

25:46.513 --> 25:49.315
if we are off the hook,

25:49.349 --> 25:51.283
the two of us, you and me.

25:51.318 --> 25:52.384
For what?

25:52.419 --> 25:54.587
He's the one who opened
his big mouth and told us

25:54.621 --> 25:56.255
his ex-wife was gay. It's
not like we just made it up.

25:56.289 --> 25:58.390
Yeah, well, I never
should have told you.

25:58.425 --> 26:01.327
I mean, if I have any hope of having
a good relationship with George,

26:01.361 --> 26:03.462
I'm going to have to
get along with Anne.

26:03.497 --> 26:04.530
Well, you don't have to
get along with her too well.

26:04.564 --> 26:08.167
What? What do you mean?

26:08.201 --> 26:10.302
You don't have to sleep with her.

26:10.337 --> 26:11.403
Of course not!

26:11.438 --> 26:14.240
You don't have to
sleep with him, either.

26:14.274 --> 26:17.176
Honey, who said anything about
sleeping with either one of them?

26:17.210 --> 26:20.212
I'm still married and I'm
not having sex with George,

26:20.247 --> 26:20.346
although, at some point, I might.

26:23.316 --> 26:25.551
Do you want to tell me what's going on?

26:25.585 --> 26:27.319
You know I'll find out anyway.

26:34.227 --> 26:35.227
Hi, Grace.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.496
Hi.

26:37.531 --> 26:39.298
Omar went home 20 minutes ago.

26:39.332 --> 26:41.400
Yeah, well, so what?

26:41.434 --> 26:44.570
So, it's just you and me here.

26:44.604 --> 26:47.273
Oh, and I just got out of the shower.

26:47.307 --> 26:48.407
I am not attracted to you.

26:48.441 --> 26:50.242
Yeah, you are. No, I'm not!

26:50.277 --> 26:50.910
It's okay.

26:50.944 --> 26:53.245
It's not okay. I am not gay.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.247
You may not be, but I think
you're afraid you're gay.

26:55.282 --> 26:57.449
No, I'm not. You know
why? Because I'm just not.

26:57.484 --> 26:59.385
Just because you've thought about
kissing me, that doesn't mean you're gay.

26:59.419 --> 27:03.355
Look, I just said the
wrong thing, all right?

27:03.390 --> 27:06.225
All right, all right.

27:06.259 --> 27:09.228
I'm just gonna sit over here and study.

27:14.367 --> 27:17.136
You know, you should study,
too. We have that history final.

27:17.170 --> 27:20.172
We've been studying for that for weeks,

27:20.207 --> 27:23.375
and if I wanted to study for it,
I would just study in my room.

27:23.410 --> 27:25.344
Would you stop being ridiculous?

27:25.378 --> 27:28.214
Nothing has changed. We're just two
girls sharing an apartment for the summer

27:28.248 --> 27:30.216
and studying for a history exam.

27:34.254 --> 27:36.355
Okay, come on. We gotta get
things back to normal here.

27:36.389 --> 27:37.389
It's too weird and it's all my fault.

27:37.424 --> 27:39.425
I promise I'll stop teasing you.

27:41.228 --> 27:44.396
It's me, Grace. Your best friend.

27:44.431 --> 27:45.464
We should be able to talk
to each other about anything,

27:45.498 --> 27:47.533
tease each other about anything.

27:47.567 --> 27:51.470
And I see that we can't and
I've made you uncomfortable.

27:51.504 --> 27:52.238
I apologize.

27:53.573 --> 27:58.210
Okay, well, I just want
things to go back to normal.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.315
(SIGHS)

28:03.350 --> 28:03.682
Sorry.

28:03.717 --> 28:05.484
No problem.

28:10.290 --> 28:11.457
I can't believe I said that.

28:11.491 --> 28:13.325
Forget about it. It
didn't mean anything.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.426
I know, but still... Hey.

28:14.461 --> 28:16.195
I said I've thought
about kissing a girl.

28:16.229 --> 28:18.497
Doesn't make me gay.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.232
Yeah, but you didn't say who.

28:22.402 --> 28:24.169
Angelina Jolie.

28:24.204 --> 28:25.437
(CHUCKLING) What?

28:25.472 --> 28:28.340
I don't know, she's really pretty.

28:28.375 --> 28:29.708
And I've honestly thought about it.

28:29.743 --> 28:32.244
But you wouldn't like actually
kiss her if you had the chance.

28:32.279 --> 28:33.212
Uh, I might, yeah.

28:35.482 --> 28:38.217
Have you ever kissed a girl before?

28:38.251 --> 28:42.187
No. Honestly, I never even thought about
it until I heard that Katy Perry song,

28:42.222 --> 28:44.223
she kissed a girl and liked it. Yeah.

28:44.257 --> 28:47.159
I don't know. It just made me curious.

28:47.193 --> 28:50.429
Or, I was curious anyway and then
I felt free to say I was curious.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.566
Kiss me.

28:56.369 --> 28:57.303
What?

28:58.471 --> 29:02.207
Yeah. You're curious. I'm curious.

29:02.242 --> 29:02.274
Kiss me.

29:06.146 --> 29:06.245
All right.

29:23.396 --> 29:25.297
(GASPS)

29:29.536 --> 29:32.338
I have never gotten any
complaints from any guys.

29:37.210 --> 29:41.767
(CLEARS THROAT)

29:41.902 --> 29:41.902
+

29:47.212 --> 29:49.247
I don't know, the
tuition's a little steep.

29:49.281 --> 29:51.482
Just fill out the application
and worry about the tuition later.

29:51.517 --> 29:53.284
It's $1,200 to apply. I need
money from him right now.

29:55.354 --> 29:57.221
You have a credit card?

29:57.256 --> 29:58.222
Put it on your credit card.

29:58.257 --> 29:59.323
You can put it on my
credit card if you want.

30:01.527 --> 30:03.361
I believe in you, Ben.

30:03.395 --> 30:06.364
And I would love to have
you at my school next year.

30:06.398 --> 30:10.435
Wouldn't it bebe great? The two
of us at the same high school?

30:10.469 --> 30:13.504
I really want to do
this. Please do this.

30:13.539 --> 30:16.307
Maybe we should just think
about going to the same college.

30:16.341 --> 30:19.544
I'm only going to be a junior next year,
so that would be two years from now.

30:19.578 --> 30:20.611
I don't want to wait two
years to be at the same school.

30:20.646 --> 30:23.548
Yeah, two years is a
long time, you're right.

30:23.582 --> 30:24.282
I'll charge it.

30:26.351 --> 30:28.519
I mean, a $1,200 charge
will go through on my card

30:28.554 --> 30:31.189
and then my dad can
just clobber me later.

30:31.223 --> 30:32.490
I mean, what's the point about arguing
about tuition if I don't even get in?

30:32.524 --> 30:34.525
Right.

30:40.399 --> 30:42.366
What's going on? What's the emergency?

30:43.602 --> 30:45.403
Are you all right? Why añe you dying?

30:45.437 --> 30:47.205
From what? You look okay to me.

30:47.239 --> 30:48.406
Jack, where have you been?

30:48.440 --> 30:50.208
Isn't it obvious I was
at football practice?

30:50.242 --> 30:52.510
I just got suited up and I went
to put my phone in my locker

30:52.544 --> 30:55.213
and I saw I had 27 messages.

30:55.247 --> 30:56.547
What are you doing here? Why
are you in the guest house?

30:56.582 --> 30:59.217
Because as of right now,
I live in the guest house.

30:59.251 --> 30:59.617
Did you and Adrian get
in a fight or something?

30:59.651 --> 31:02.353
Or something.

31:02.387 --> 31:04.555
Grace, this better be important
or I am in big trouble.

31:04.590 --> 31:07.525
This isn't a high school team
I'm on anymore. It's college.

31:07.559 --> 31:10.294
I could get kicked off for
not showing up on the field.

31:10.329 --> 31:12.530
Just tell me what's going on so I
can get back before anyone notices.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.400
I kissed Adrian.

31:16.435 --> 31:18.469
Really? Say that again.

31:18.504 --> 31:22.540
Well, I didn't kiss her. She
kissed me. I asked her to kiss me.

31:22.574 --> 31:24.475
Really?

31:24.510 --> 31:26.310
Yeah, and I don't really
know why I did that.

31:26.345 --> 31:28.546
Yeah, I don't know why you did
either, but I'm glad you did.

31:28.580 --> 31:30.515
Why? I don't know. I just am.

31:30.549 --> 31:33.251
Where were you?

31:33.285 --> 31:34.352
I'm not going to give
you all the details.

31:34.386 --> 31:35.486
Then why'd I come over here?

31:35.521 --> 31:37.388
Because I need you to kiss me.

31:37.422 --> 31:39.457
Yeah, sure. I'll kiss you.

31:39.491 --> 31:40.358
And I need you to be my
boyfriend and have sex with me.

31:40.392 --> 31:43.261
Lots and lots and lots of sex, okay?

31:43.295 --> 31:45.363
Day and night, around the clock, 24-7.

31:45.397 --> 31:47.465
Oral sex, sex sex, any kind
of sex, all kinds of sex.

31:47.499 --> 31:49.367
I need that. With you.

31:49.401 --> 31:51.369
Okay, this was totally
worth leaving practice for.

31:54.439 --> 31:56.474
And you have no idea why Grace would
move home in the middle of the night?

31:56.508 --> 31:58.576
No.

31:58.610 --> 31:59.343
What could have happened?

31:59.378 --> 32:02.480
Maybe she and Adrian got into it.

32:02.514 --> 32:08.286
I don't think it has
anything to do with Adrian.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.388
I think it has to do with Jack.

32:10.422 --> 32:13.191
His car is outside.

32:13.225 --> 32:14.659
You're kidding.

32:14.693 --> 32:19.263
No, I'm not kidding. Maybe he and
I can move back in the guest house.

32:19.298 --> 32:23.234
I have a feeling if Jack moves back into
the guest house, it'll be with Grace.

32:23.268 --> 32:25.403
Oh no, he is not moving into
the guest house with Grace.

32:25.437 --> 32:27.405
I second that.

32:27.439 --> 32:28.406
I'll find out what's going on.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.541
I'll let you know. Thank you.

32:34.213 --> 32:37.248
What is wrong with you?

32:37.282 --> 32:39.517
Brothers do not rat out sisters.

32:39.551 --> 32:41.319
I'm protecting Grace.

32:41.353 --> 32:44.188
From what?

32:44.223 --> 32:45.523
I don't really know. That's
just what your mother said.

32:45.557 --> 32:51.395
You can't listen to her.

32:51.430 --> 32:55.166
Mothers will tell you
anything to get information.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.501
That's ridiculous.

32:57.536 --> 33:01.372
My mother and I have a very open
relationship. We tell each other everything.

33:01.406 --> 33:02.506
Why wouldn't I tell
your mother everything?

33:02.541 --> 33:06.277
Because this is America.

33:06.311 --> 33:09.180
Everyone lies to their mother.

33:09.214 --> 33:10.214
They do not.

33:11.483 --> 33:13.184
Do they?

33:13.218 --> 33:14.552
Yes.

33:14.586 --> 33:17.221
Well, she's not my mother.

33:17.256 --> 33:20.258
Your father is my father but
your mother is not my mother.

33:20.292 --> 33:23.461
I have a very bad temper, you know.

33:30.369 --> 33:32.370
(SIGHS) Mom and Ashley
got stuck in Amsterdam.

33:32.404 --> 33:33.471
They're still not home yet.

33:33.505 --> 33:35.273
Are you going to leave
school when they get home?

33:35.307 --> 33:37.208
No, I'm not going to school.

33:37.242 --> 33:39.210
I'm not going to have people
guessing whether or not I'm gay.

33:39.244 --> 33:40.478
They're going to do that
whether or not you're at school.

33:40.512 --> 33:43.281
Amy, you have to go to
school. This is ridiculous.

33:43.315 --> 33:45.416
Is it? Would you go to school
if people were pointing at you

33:45.450 --> 33:48.252
and whispering behind your back
trying to figure out if you're gay?

33:48.287 --> 33:50.154
First of all, there is
nothing wrong with being gay.

33:50.188 --> 33:51.822
Except that I'm not.

33:51.857 --> 33:55.259
Secondly, don't get all upset and nervous
because a bunch of idiots are texting.

33:55.294 --> 33:58.296
Well, I don't like it,
okay? I just don't like it.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.363
I'm gonna go over to
my dad's house and wait

33:59.398 --> 34:01.365
for my mom and Ashley to get there.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.168
Griffin is over there, you
know, he spent the night.

34:04.202 --> 34:05.436
Griffin? What is Griffin doing there?

34:05.470 --> 34:07.505
Oh, no. He, uh, heard the rumors.

34:07.539 --> 34:10.373
I think he went over
to talk to your dad,

34:10.409 --> 34:11.509
see how your dad was, see if
he could offer some support.

34:11.543 --> 34:13.511
Because I'm gay?

34:13.545 --> 34:16.313
(LAUGHS) Are you?

34:16.348 --> 34:18.215
That does it. I am going to school.

34:18.250 --> 34:21.185
You have a history final.
You have to go to school.

34:21.219 --> 34:24.355
I am. And I'm going to
tell everyone I am not gay.

34:24.389 --> 34:27.291
People are probably going to be talking
about something entirely different today.

34:27.326 --> 34:28.559
It's high school. That's
how high school is.

34:28.592 --> 34:31.161
You know that. So don't
do anything stupid.

34:34.166 --> 34:35.433
(SIGHS)

34:35.467 --> 34:36.167
I forgot John.

34:36.435 --> 34:38.335
(SIGHS)

34:43.275 --> 34:45.176
<i>Bonjour!</i>

34:45.210 --> 34:46.377
Hi, George. It's good to be home.

34:46.411 --> 34:49.347
Let me get that for you.

34:49.380 --> 34:53.317
Hey, sugarplum, how was France? Fine.

34:53.351 --> 34:55.152
Oh, don't tell me all I'm
going to get is "fine."

34:55.187 --> 34:57.421
She needs some sleep.
We both need sleep.

34:57.456 --> 34:58.189
First I wanna go check on Robie.

35:00.258 --> 35:03.260
Is that lady still in my room?

35:03.295 --> 35:04.528
Nora? No, I had her take everything out.
It's all yours, as long as you want it.

35:04.563 --> 35:07.465
I don't really want it. I
just need someplace to crash.

35:07.499 --> 35:09.333
You got it. You want
some breakfast first?

35:09.368 --> 35:12.370
Not really.

35:12.404 --> 35:15.139
God, how many people did you
feed in here this morning?

35:15.173 --> 35:17.241
Oh, your buddy came by to
see you last night. Griffin.

35:17.275 --> 35:20.378
And he stayed for breakfast?

35:20.412 --> 35:23.314
Uh, yeah. We stayed up all night
playing cards, waiting on you two.

35:23.348 --> 35:24.915
Why? Because you've been gone for weeks.

35:24.950 --> 35:28.519
No, why would Griffin stay up all night
with you waiting for me to get home?

35:28.553 --> 35:31.322
Because he missed you?

35:31.356 --> 35:33.224
What's going on? Nothing.

35:33.258 --> 35:34.091
Never mind. I'll ask Griffin.

35:34.126 --> 35:35.459
Ask Griffin what?

35:37.429 --> 35:40.331
Robie's still asleep.

35:40.365 --> 35:42.400
Why he stayed up all night with Dad
playing cards waiting for me to get home.

35:42.434 --> 35:45.302
Oh, that was sweet.

35:45.337 --> 35:48.139
Uh-huh. We'll see. Good night.

35:54.379 --> 35:57.248
Boy, the trip to Europe did her some
good. She's more delightful than ever.

35:57.282 --> 35:58.449
She's tired.

35:58.483 --> 36:00.151
We spent the layover in
Amsterdam seeing the city

36:00.185 --> 36:04.188
when we should have gotten a
hotel room and gotten some sleep.

36:04.222 --> 36:06.290
We've been up almost 48 hours, except
for a couple of naps on the plane.

36:06.324 --> 36:09.193
I really need to get to bed.

36:09.227 --> 36:11.462
Yeah, sure. I set the room up for
you, cleaned the sheets, everything.

36:11.496 --> 36:14.398
Did you? I sure did.

36:14.433 --> 36:19.303
Well, you know, Robie's still
sleeping and I really did miss you.

36:19.337 --> 36:21.372
Do you want to go back to bed with me?

36:23.408 --> 36:24.208
Could be like old times.

36:30.382 --> 36:33.417
Really, we could just go
back to the way things were.

36:36.121 --> 36:38.355
If you hadn't told Kathleen that I'm
gay and she hadn't told the entire world!

36:39.157 --> 36:40.191
We'll talk when I get up.

36:44.429 --> 36:46.430
Yikes.

36:49.908 --> 36:49.908
+

36:55.629 --> 36:57.396
Hey! Ashley!

36:58.465 --> 36:59.365
(MOANS JOYFULLY)

37:02.436 --> 37:06.405
What? You called me all the way back
over here and this is the greeting I get?

37:06.440 --> 37:08.207
What were you doing
over here last night?

37:08.241 --> 37:09.608
I just droed by to
say hello to your dad.

37:09.643 --> 37:12.311
He and Nora were playing cards
and I just hung out. I don't know.

37:12.346 --> 37:14.413
No, you know. I know what?

37:14.448 --> 37:16.482
You know something.

37:16.516 --> 37:17.350
Oh. I thought I knew something,
but it turns out I don't.

37:17.384 --> 37:20.519
Uh-huh. What don't you know, then?

37:20.554 --> 37:22.455
That Amy is gay?

37:22.489 --> 37:24.357
I knew it!

37:24.391 --> 37:26.392
No, no, you don't know anything.
It turns out it was a rumor.

37:26.426 --> 37:26.759
Well, sometimes rumors are true.

37:26.793 --> 37:29.128
Sometimes.

37:29.162 --> 37:31.230
The Fourth of July was a sign.

37:31.264 --> 37:32.365
Where do people get this, that the
Fourth of July is a gay holiday?

37:32.399 --> 37:34.333
I'm gay and I've never
heard of that before.

37:34.368 --> 37:39.271
Oh, come on. Shorts? Bandanas? Visors?

37:39.306 --> 37:42.208
Everyone wears shorts, bandanas, visors.

37:42.242 --> 37:43.242
Well, everyone includes gays.

37:43.276 --> 37:43.542
I think you're reaching.

37:43.577 --> 37:45.344
Maybe.

37:45.445 --> 37:47.480
So Amy is gay.

37:49.316 --> 37:50.516
Does Ricky know yet?

37:50.550 --> 37:52.451
You're not back to
that, are you? To Ricky?

37:58.458 --> 38:00.393
I can't believe that the two of
you did not tell me that that's

38:00.427 --> 38:02.428
what people were talking about.

38:02.462 --> 38:04.163
Well, you can't just walk
up to someone and say, "Hey,

38:04.197 --> 38:07.233
"there's a rumor going around
school about you that you're gay."

38:07.267 --> 38:08.401
Yes, you can.

38:08.435 --> 38:10.369
Ben did. Ben told me.

38:10.404 --> 38:13.305
I really don't like that you and
Ben are getting so close again.

38:13.340 --> 38:15.408
Why not? Ben is never going to come
between Ricky and me. We're just friends.

38:15.442 --> 38:18.344
Are you sure you're
going to marry Ricky?

38:18.378 --> 38:20.246
I set the date.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.581
Yeah, but it's... The Fourth
of July is not a gay holiday!

38:22.616 --> 38:26.419
It is now. That's the
power of suggestion.

38:26.453 --> 38:30.456
People hear it, they believe it, whether
it's absolutely ridiculous or not.

38:30.490 --> 38:32.291
Until something more
ridiculous comes along.

38:45.338 --> 38:46.305
Good morning.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.175
Good morning.

38:49.209 --> 38:51.310
Hey, if you guys hear
anything, it's totally true.

38:51.344 --> 38:53.212
Yeah, okay, thanks.

38:53.246 --> 38:54.513
Wait. Wait. What would we have heard?

38:54.548 --> 38:56.315
Do we have to do this?

38:56.349 --> 38:57.583
Come on, you know you
want to. No, I don't.

38:57.617 --> 39:01.220
Oh, forget it. I thought you
guys already probably heard.

39:01.254 --> 39:03.422
I mean, Grace did move out in the
middle of the night, and by now

39:03.457 --> 39:06.192
I thought she would have texted
Jack and Jack would have texted you.

39:06.226 --> 39:08.360
And you would have told Henry
and Henry would have told Ben.

39:08.395 --> 39:10.296
Oh, the suspense is building.

39:10.330 --> 39:12.198
No, it's not. No, it is.

39:12.232 --> 39:14.200
Why did Grace go home in
the middle of the night?

39:14.234 --> 39:15.367
Did you two get in a fight?

39:15.402 --> 39:16.435
Like was there physical
contact or anything?

39:16.470 --> 39:18.204
Stop it.

39:18.238 --> 39:19.371
Oh, it was just something stupid.

39:19.406 --> 39:20.306
I kissed her.

39:21.575 --> 39:24.343
Well, she asked me to kiss
her and so I kissed her

39:24.377 --> 39:29.515
and then she got all
freaked out about it.

39:29.549 --> 39:30.583
See you guys later.

39:37.324 --> 39:39.258
Good morning.

39:39.292 --> 39:42.461
Good morning. Oh, and by
the way, hey, I am not gay!

39:42.496 --> 39:45.464
And the Fourth of July
is not a gay holiday.

39:45.499 --> 39:48.467
Whatever. No one cares about that now.

39:48.502 --> 39:50.569
You can't always be
the center of attention.

39:53.473 --> 39:55.374
I don't want to be the center of
attention. Where did she get that?

39:59.546 --> 40:02.481
Hey, okay, I am not gay!

40:02.516 --> 40:06.519
All right? If any of you are still talking
about my mother or me or my wedding,

40:06.553 --> 40:09.455
my mother is not gay, I am
not gay. I am getting married

40:09.489 --> 40:12.558
and the Fourth of July is
not some kind of gay holiday!

40:12.592 --> 40:14.493
No one's talking about that.

40:14.528 --> 40:16.462
Oh, really? What are they talking about?

40:16.496 --> 40:18.364
Adrian and Grace kissed.

40:18.398 --> 40:21.267
Each other.

40:21.301 --> 40:22.601
Yeah. Breaking news.

40:26.406 --> 40:26.438
Wow.

40:32.546 --> 40:33.312
Don't get any ideas.

40:37.517 --> 40:39.585
What's up? Want to go shoot some hoops?

40:39.619 --> 40:42.421
No, I don't.

40:42.455 --> 40:44.423
I just thought you might be
interested in a text I got from Raven.

40:44.457 --> 40:46.258
Why would I be interested
in a text from Raven?

40:46.293 --> 40:48.360
'Cause you're the one who told me
that Grace wanted to sleep with me

40:48.395 --> 40:49.562
just to prove she's
not attracted to Adrian.

40:49.596 --> 40:51.497
Hey, don't be spreading
that around, all right?

40:51.531 --> 40:53.432
Adrian would get really upset with me.

40:53.466 --> 40:56.368
Yeah, or you would get
really upset with Adrian.

40:56.403 --> 40:58.404
Don't you two have some sort of
agreement to be just with each other?

40:59.639 --> 41:01.407
She and Grace kissed
each other last night.

41:01.441 --> 41:04.310
What? And Raven knows that how?

41:04.344 --> 41:05.878
Well, let me see.

41:05.912 --> 41:10.482
Adrian told Ben and Ben told Dylan
and Dylan told Raven and Raven told me.

41:10.517 --> 41:12.418
That can't be true. And if it is?

41:15.589 --> 41:18.591
I mean, just because a girl kisses
a girl does not mean that she's gay!

41:18.625 --> 41:20.292
You're making way too much of this.

41:20.327 --> 41:22.428
Am I? Am I making too much of this?

41:22.462 --> 41:24.363
Because if this ever got out...

41:24.397 --> 41:28.567
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

41:28.602 --> 41:30.502
(WHISPERING) Oh, my...
