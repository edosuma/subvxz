      just live on campus?      

01:01.395 --> 01:02.394

      where are we going?       

02:00.454 --> 02:03.455
  - [Scotty] I mean, Alvarado

          I told you.           

02:31.986 --> 02:33.819
      They're tearing up a      
  different street every day.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.158
   - [Josef] That's his road.   

02:39.160 --> 02:40.492

       the fuckin' road!

     fucking unbelievable.

    - [Josef] Well what are     
  they supposed to do, Scotty?  

02:42.830 --> 02:43.996
  - [Scotty] Round 'em all up.  

02:43.998 --> 02:46.331
        Give 'em a mop,         
       give 'em a broom.

      shit up, first off!

      - [Josef] Then what?      

02:50.504 --> 02:53.839
   I thought they gentrified    
       this shit already.       

02:53.841 --> 02:57.509
  - [ Scotty] Not fast enough.  

02:57.511 --> 02:58.343
     - [Josef] Look at baby     
      girl, there's candy.      

02:58.345 --> 03:00.679
    - She had a cell phone.     

03:00.681 --> 03:02.014
      - Well I mean, like,      

03:02.016 --> 03:04.683
      I usually go by that      
       tower over there.        

03:04.685 --> 03:06.185
That's the building I usually go

03:06.187 --> 03:07.853
    so like just don't stop.

       lock it, lock it.

       fuck is he doing?        

03:23.304 --> 03:24.536
 - [Scotty] Are you kidding me? 

03:24.538 --> 03:26.038
- [Marshal] Lovely neighborhood.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.039
        - [Josef] Shit.         

03:27.041 --> 03:28.373
          (whistling)           

03:28.375 --> 03:32.878

       you witching hour.       

03:32.880 --> 03:34.880
  - [Josef] There's some guys   
   smoking crack right there.   

03:34.882 --> 03:37.216
 - Can you pull out your phone. 

03:37.218 --> 03:40.052
   Type in your address so we   
 can get out of this nightmare. 

03:40.054 --> 03:40.886
     - I've got no signal.      

03:40.888 --> 03:43.388
    It's just it's nothing.     

03:43.390 --> 03:49.394

 Great Wall of Tents out here.

    (voices outside vehicle)    
       Fuck you, come on!       

03:55.903 --> 03:57.402
     - [Josef] Do we make a     
    left or a right, Scotty?    

03:57.404 --> 03:59.071
  Look at these bums crossing   
      the street up there.      

03:59.073 --> 04:00.405
  - [Scotty] It's not my idea   
  to turn onto Kreuger Street.  

04:00.407 --> 04:01.740
 - [Marshal] What is going on?  

04:01.742 --> 04:03.075
      - [Scotty] What the       
       fuck is he doing?        

04:03.077 --> 04:04.910
        - [Josef] It's a        
       zombie apocalypse.       

04:04.912 --> 04:08.580
   - [Scotty] What the fuck?    

04:08.582 --> 04:13.085
          - Hey, hey!           
           (groaning)

           (groaning)           

04:21.428 --> 04:23.428
   - [Marshal] Wait, what is    
  he doing, what is he doing?   

04:23.430 --> 04:25.931
    - Stay in school, kids!     
          - I'm sorry.          

04:25.933 --> 04:28.100
     I'm so fucking sorry.      

04:28.102 --> 04:31.603
       - [Josef] Get the        
     fuck outta here, man!      

04:31.605 --> 04:32.437
       - Get outta here!        

04:32.439 --> 04:34.273
          It's my car!          

04:34.275 --> 04:35.941
       - Get off the car!       
           - Kill me!           

04:35.943 --> 04:39.278
       - Get off the car!       
           - Kill me!           

04:39.280 --> 04:40.445
            Kill me!            

04:40.447 --> 04:41.947
         - [Josef] You          
      heard him, Marshie!       

04:41.949 --> 04:44.449
        - I'm so sorry.         
       - Get off the car!       

04:44.451 --> 04:45.450
            - Torro!            

04:45.452 --> 04:46.451
             Torro!             

04:46.453 --> 04:47.119
             Torro!

             Torro!             

04:48.789 --> 04:49.788
             Torro!             

04:49.790 --> 04:51.123
             Torro!             

04:51.125 --> 04:52.791
     - Last time I'm doing      
      any favors for you!       

04:52.793 --> 04:53.792
- [Josef] Green means go, Chief!

04:53.794 --> 04:55.460
        Green means go.         

04:55.462 --> 04:57.296
     - [Marshal] Let's go,      
      let's go, let's go.       

04:57.298 --> 04:58.797
      - [Scamp] Iwo Jima!       

04:58.799 --> 05:03.302
  - [Scotty] So this hobo, he   
rubs his junk all over your car.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.469
        I mean, you can         
       just wash it off!        

05:04.471 --> 05:05.971
       - [Marshal] Okay.        

05:05.973 --> 05:07.306
      - [Josef] You didn't      
     see anything like that     

05:07.308 --> 05:08.974
       back in Nebraska,        
      did you Scotty boy?       

05:08.976 --> 05:12.477
           (laughing)           
       (alarms sounding)        

05:12.479 --> 05:14.146
           Oh, shit.            

05:14.148 --> 05:15.647
    - [Marshal] You're lost.    

05:15.649 --> 05:17.316
- [Josef] You're seriously lost.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.984
    - [Marshal] You have to     
   give me better directions.   

05:18.986 --> 05:20.152
  - [Scotty] Make a left here,  
   make a left, make a left!    

05:20.154 --> 05:21.486
       - [Josef] How long       
      have you lived here?      

05:21.488 --> 05:22.487
         I mean, like a         
       month, two months?       

05:22.489 --> 05:23.155
      - [Scotty] Exactly!       
           (laughing)           

05:23.157 --> 05:26.158
        (intense music)         

05:32.933 --> 05:34.333
       Uh, it's a detour.       

05:34.335 --> 05:37.169
      - We're back at the       
    fucking bridge, Scotty!     

05:37.171 --> 05:38.503
         What is this?          

05:38.505 --> 05:40.005
   - [Scotty] Well, at least    
   we're at a starting point    

05:40.007 --> 05:40.672
         that we know.          

05:40.674 --> 05:43.842
        So turn around.         

05:43.844 --> 05:45.510
      - [Marshal] No, I'm       
    just turning you around.    

05:45.512 --> 05:47.512
    I'm crossing the street.    

06:07.634 --> 06:10.535
    [Scotty] Well, at least     
      there's less tents.       

06:10.537 --> 06:12.037
    - [Josef] We're getting     
      away from the tents.      

06:12.039 --> 06:13.539
        - [Scotty] Yeah.        

06:13.540 --> 06:15.040
     - [Josef] And from the     
     shitting on the wall.      

06:29.323 --> 06:30.722
       (tire blowing out)       

06:30.724 --> 06:31.723
       (everyone startled       
       cries and cussing)       

06:31.725 --> 06:32.557
        - [Marshal] What        
       the fuck was that?       

06:32.559 --> 06:33.725
    - [Scotty] I don't know.    

06:33.727 --> 06:36.061
 Just pull over, check it out.  

06:36.063 --> 06:38.063
         - [Josef] Look         
       where we are, man!       

06:38.065 --> 06:40.232
       - [Marshal] You're       
      fucking kidding me!       

06:40.234 --> 06:42.401
       God, you and your        
        stupid detours.         

06:42.403 --> 06:43.902
   What's wrong with you man?   

06:43.904 --> 06:45.070
   - [Scotty] Don't blame me,   
    man, it's not my fault!     

06:45.072 --> 06:46.238
       - [Marshal] You've       
    lived here for a month.     

06:46.240 --> 06:47.406
      You don't even know       
        where you live!         

06:47.408 --> 06:49.574
          It's stupid.          

06:49.576 --> 06:52.577
Oh my God, man, look at my tire!

06:52.579 --> 06:54.913
     I have a flat, Scotty!     

06:54.915 --> 06:56.581
       - Don't worry man        
       he'll get over it.       

06:56.583 --> 07:01.253
- [Scotty] Do you have a spare? 

07:01.255 --> 07:02.587
    - And no fucking signal.    

07:02.589 --> 07:04.089
      Get out of the car,       
      get out of the car!       

07:04.091 --> 07:05.090
- [Josef] Alright, we'll fix it.

07:05.092 --> 07:05.924
 - [Scotty] Just fix it, yeah.  

07:05.926 --> 07:09.761
      Where's your spare?       

07:09.763 --> 07:10.929
         - Shit, Josef,         
       look at that shit!       

07:10.931 --> 07:12.431
 - [Scotty] Where's your spare? 

07:12.433 --> 07:13.265
     - Just get the spare.      

07:13.267 --> 07:15.434
      - [Marshal] Fix It!       

07:15.436 --> 07:17.102
    Just fix it, c'mon man!     

07:17.104 --> 07:19.104
      - [Scotty] Yes, it's      
   just a fucking flat tire.    

07:19.106 --> 07:20.439
 - [Josef] Some fucking night.  

07:20.441 --> 07:23.942
             Woah!

      - There's nails all       
      over in this board!       

07:28.782 --> 07:29.948
        - [Scotty] What?        

07:29.950 --> 07:32.784
          - Holy shit!          
      - Who would do this?

       (disturbing music)       

07:43.797 --> 07:47.632
         - Need a hand?         

07:47.634 --> 07:49.801
     - Yeah, we got a flat.     

07:49.803 --> 07:55.640
       - That's too bad.        

07:55.642 --> 07:58.810
   - Yeah, we ran over that.    

07:58.812 --> 08:03.648
      ¶ Ain't that a shame      
           (laughing)           

08:10.591 --> 08:12.491
        - [Wilco] Let me        
        take care of it.        

08:12.493 --> 08:13.158
        - We're going to        
        fix it, alright?        

08:13.160 --> 08:18.663

    - [Josef] Scotty, what's    
  fucking wrong with you, man?  

08:39.852 --> 08:43.522
   - [Marshal] What the fuck!

       College boys, huh?       

10:00.434 --> 10:02.934
    I asked you a question.     

10:02.936 --> 10:05.103
  - Leave me alone, get the F-  

10:05.105 --> 10:06.104

         Football star.

  What position you play, boy?  

10:29.796 --> 10:31.463
      I'm talking to you.

    - OJ was a running back.    

10:46.480 --> 10:48.313
     - I know what he was.      

10:48.315 --> 10:51.483
    He was a fucking psycho.    

10:51.485 --> 10:55.153
     And what are you boys      
       doing in my house?

12:03.890 --> 12:06.891
      You think this is a       
     fucking joke, Scotty?      

12:06.893 --> 12:11.563
         - Yeah, I do.

       (emotional music)        

14:02.943 --> 14:09.681
          - He's dead!          

14:09.683 --> 14:12.016
       - Had to be done.        

14:12.018 --> 14:17.188
         Had to do it.          

14:17.190 --> 14:22.861
    It's either them or us.     

14:22.863 --> 14:25.363
           Hey Spic!            

14:25.365 --> 14:27.031
     You find that bullet.      

14:27.033 --> 14:28.867
       You dig it out of        
      him if you have to.       

14:28.869 --> 14:32.537
         - Sure thing.          

14:32.539 --> 14:34.372

       Make'em disappear.       

14:38.044 --> 14:41.379
 Strip 'em, chop 'em, burn 'em. 

14:41.381 --> 14:46.217
     Don't leave any trace.     

14:46.219 --> 14:47.719
  This one's still breathing.   

14:47.721 --> 14:49.554
          - Hey Wilco.          

14:49.556 --> 14:51.055
     I can take care of it.     

14:51.057 --> 14:52.724
            - Yeah.             

14:52.726 --> 14:54.893
        You'll do it in         
      the river, quietly.       

14:54.895 --> 14:57.061
  - This is messed up, Wilco.   

14:57.063 --> 14:58.229
      - How do you figure?      

14:58.231 --> 14:59.564
     - Killing these kids?      

14:59.566 --> 15:01.733
    - I'll take care of it.     

15:01.735 --> 15:03.401
     I always take care of      
      you people, don't I?      

15:03.403 --> 15:04.736
        (bums agreeing)         

15:04.738 --> 15:06.237
        - Sure, but it's        
       just, it's just...       

15:06.239 --> 15:07.572
         - Hey listen.          

15:07.574 --> 15:09.240
        We all agreed to        
     jump them, didn't we?      

15:09.242 --> 15:12.410
       To push 'em back!        

15:12.412 --> 15:14.913
  Whether you like it or not,   
    we're in this together.     

15:14.915 --> 15:18.416
            Alright?            

15:18.418 --> 15:24.589
     These punks would bury     
   us, given half the chance.   

15:24.591 --> 15:28.593
      What's done is done.      

15:28.595 --> 15:33.765
   We've just got to get, to    
  get rid of them that's all.   

15:33.767 --> 15:34.599
            Come on.

     Come on, hurry it up.

          In the fire.          

15:48.114 --> 15:53.117
     In the fire all of it.     

15:53.119 --> 15:56.120
      What's done is done.      

15:56.122 --> 15:59.123
  Just gotta get rid of what's  
   left of them, that's all.

       (train passing by)       

16:45.271 --> 16:48.006

I'll get this fucking shirt off.

17:37.891 --> 17:42.393
       I'm sorry, friend.       

17:42.395 --> 17:44.562
       - [Marshal] Stop!

     - [Swallow] Get down,

    - Should have never let     
    it get this far, Wilco!     

47:40.024 --> 47:45.194

47:45.196 --> 47:47.697
  You're saying it's my fault?  

47:47.699 --> 47:49.365

Put a Starbucks in every corner,

 so some hip puke can walk his  
  dog where we laid our heads?  

48:24.068 --> 48:25.568
    They're gonna tear down     
    the Sixth Street Bridge

    - Woah, woah, woah, hey!    

57:42.460 --> 57:43.625
        Don't touch me.         

57:43.627 --> 57:45.294
 - Look lady, I'm just trying-- 

57:45.296 --> 57:47.463
     - My name's Mona, bum.     

57:47.465 --> 57:49.965
        - I'm not a bum.        

57:49.967 --> 57:50.799
            - Yeah?             

57:50.801 --> 57:52.801
    Well, you look like one.    

57:52.803 --> 57:54.636
      You smell like one.       

57:54.638 --> 57:56.805
      Sorry, you're a bum.      

57:56.807 --> 57:58.140
        - I'm not a bum.        

57:58.142 --> 57:59.475
   My name is Marshal Colter.   

57:59.477 --> 58:01.310
     I'm a freshman at USC.     

58:01.312 --> 58:02.811
 - Oh, so you're a college bum. 

58:02.813 --> 58:05.147
   - These aren't my clothes!   

58:05.149 --> 58:07.316
    Look, those psychopaths     
      murdered my friends,      

58:07.318 --> 58:08.817
   and now they're after me.    

58:08.819 --> 58:10.652
          - Oh, great!          

58:10.654 --> 58:12.654
   I wish I could help, okay?   

58:12.656 --> 58:15.991
     I've never been to the     
      cop shop down there.      

58:15.993 --> 58:20.996
    And I don't want to go.     

58:20.998 --> 58:22.331
              Bye.              

58:22.333 --> 58:24.500
     - Well, then where's a     
     hotel or a restaurant?     

58:24.502 --> 58:26.502
 Something with a sign of life? 

58:26.504 --> 58:28.837
 Anyplace I could find someone? 

58:28.839 --> 58:31.673
  - Don't fucking yell at me.   

58:31.675 --> 58:35.677
     There's a restaurant,      
      no, there's a hotel.      

58:35.679 --> 58:38.680
      You know, back where      
     we lost your friends?      

58:38.682 --> 58:41.683
           Go there.            

58:41.685 --> 58:43.685
            - Buses?            

58:43.687 --> 58:45.854
     - [Mona] They stopped      
       running hours ago.       

58:45.856 --> 58:49.525
 - [Marshal] Do you have a car? 

58:49.527 --> 58:51.026
          - A Porsche?          

58:51.028 --> 58:53.028
             C'mon.             

58:53.030 --> 58:58.700
  - What about this Eddie guy?  

58:58.702 --> 59:00.869
     - You don't got money?     

59:00.871 --> 59:04.706
   Eddie don't want you, and    
  you don't got money, honey.   

59:04.708 --> 59:06.208
      - I just saved you.       

59:06.210 --> 59:07.709
          - Saved me?           

59:07.711 --> 59:10.879
    Worst they could've done    
    is tore me up a little.     

59:10.881 --> 59:13.048
        It's nothing new        
        down there, man.        

59:13.050 --> 59:18.220
     You just pissed those      
 beaners off good, that's all.  

59:18.222 --> 59:20.222
 - You're a real piece of work. 

59:26.997 --> 59:29.898
     - Yeah, that's right.      

59:29.900 --> 59:31.733
      You know what, I get      
      fucked for a living.      

59:31.735 --> 59:34.069
 That's how I can fucking live! 

59:34.071 --> 59:37.072
   That's how Eddie and I get   
    by, and it works for us.    

59:37.074 --> 59:40.075
       So don't you dare        
        look down on us.        

59:40.077 --> 59:44.746
       Now back off, bum.       

59:44.748 --> 59:46.248
          - I'm sorry.          

59:52.690 --> 59:54.756
            Please.             

59:54.758 --> 59:56.258
            Help me.            

01:00:04.535 --> 01:00:07.436
            - Fine.             

01:00:07.438 --> 01:00:10.439
    Eddie can tell you where    
     you can find the cops.     

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:19.781
       (energetic music)        

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:22.117
        - [Swallow] No.         

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:24.786
  Fuck, I gotta take a break.   

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.288
        I need to rest.         

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:30.626
           (coughing)           

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:32.461
     It's hard to breathe.      

01:00:32.463 --> 01:00:34.296
    - What now, my lovelies?    

01:00:34.298 --> 01:00:34.963
           You okay?            

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.798
    - Just give me a second.    

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.133
          - All right.          

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:41.637
    Quit you're whining, up     
    on your feet, let's go.     

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:42.804
      - She can't breathe.      

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:45.140
     - I don't give a fuck.     

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:46.642
   Suck it up, sweet cheeks,    

01:00:46.644 --> 01:00:49.645
     or I'll use your head      
     for a fuckin' pinata.      

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:52.314
            - Okay.             

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:54.316
             - Now.             

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:57.152
       Who's the whore he       
       was running with?        

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:58.487
          - Beats me.           

01:00:58.489 --> 01:00:59.988
       - [Wilco] Swallow?       

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.156
  - I think I know who she is.  

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:02.491
     I've seen her around.      

01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:04.326
    - [Wilko] Around where?     

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.827
      - By the old Church.      

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:06.995
           Over on...           

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:08.497
      (coughing violently)      

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:10.666
  - Hey, hey, hey, okay relax.  

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:12.501
        Breathe, relax.         

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:16.338
             Slow.              

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:19.841
  - Take a little nip of this.  

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:23.345
            - Good.             

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:25.847
 - I said a little, come here.  

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:30.852
      There's crystal meth      
     in here, with tequila.     

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:33.689
        You feel better?        

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:34.523
       - [Swallow] Yeah.        

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:36.858
            - Good.             

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.194
 This Eddie, where's he crash?  

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.862
   - Over at the old Church.    

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:41.863
           On Fleet.            

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:45.367
      Near the graveyard.       

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:47.035
     - Alright sugar tits.      

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.538
         On your feet,          
      we're off to Fleet.       

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.039
            Come on.            

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.875
             - Hey.             
            - C'mon.            

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.377
- I can't take his shit no more.

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:57.546
- Well, I'm open to suggestions.

01:01:57.548 --> 01:02:00.882
      - Well maybe we can       
    just walk the other way.    

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:04.386
        (intense music)         

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:06.888
          - Hey spic!           

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.057
      What are you waiting      
    for, come on, let's go.     

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:09.891
            Come on!            

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.060
  - I'm not a fucking Mexican.  

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.895
      For two years you've      
   been calling me a beaner,    

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:18.400
    border bandit, wetback,     
    greaser, migger, roach,     

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:20.902
         Mexicant, taco         
       jockey, field rat!       

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:23.238
         I'm Argentine!         

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.242
       - Alright burrito        
       breath, back off.        

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:29.244
Get your brown taco ass moving, 

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:33.081
      or I'll kill you and      
    her right here and now.     

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.583
             Go on!             

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:35.250
          Come on, go!          

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.084
              Go!               

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.252
        - Motherfucker!         

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.253
     - [Swallow] Fuck YOU!      

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.254
      - [Wilco] Oh, yeah?       

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.589
  (speaking foreign language)   

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:43.592
       (energetic music)        

01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:01.276
         - This is it.          

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:06.782
 God, my shoes are killing me.  

01:03:06.784 --> 01:03:08.450
        - You live here?        

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:10.452
       - Not supposed to.       

01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:22.798
          Closed down.          

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.135
  They were going to level it.  

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.137
      Dig those graves up?      

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:31.973
      Tear a church down?       

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.975
 Well, that was five years ago. 

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.977
         Who knows what         
      happened with that.       

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:38.480
       - [Marshal] Well,        
     the economy, I guess.      

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:42.484
     - I say the Lord works     
      in mysterious ways.       

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:07.008
             Eddie?             

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:11.179
             Eddie?             

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:15.350
             Eddie!             

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.518
         - Where is it?         

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.186
   - There was some trouble.    

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:20.522
        - I don't care,         
    where's the shit, baby?     

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:23.692
     - They robbed me, and      
     they tried to rape me.     

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:24.693
    - I don't fucking care.     

01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:26.027
       Where's the shit?        

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:28.530
     You weren't even gone      
       for fucking hours.       

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:29.865
       - I don't have it!       

01:04:29.867 --> 01:04:31.032
       - What do you mean       
       you don't have it?       

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:33.702
    - I was fucking robbed!     

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:34.536
            Get it?             

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:35.537
       - It was my fault!       

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:37.539
   - [Mona] He's okay, Eddie.   

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:38.874
  - You brought, you brought--  

01:04:38.876 --> 01:04:41.543
       - He helped me, he       
        helped me, okay?        

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:42.711
     - I don't give a shit.     

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:44.212
      You bring a stinking      
          bum in here?          

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.380
What the fuck are you thinking? 

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:48.216
- [Marshal] Hey man, calm down! 

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:49.718
        - It's okay, he         
       just needs a fix.        

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.552
    - Tell me to calm down?     

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.220

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:01.563
        Did you bring a         
     fucking narc in here?      

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:05.233
     What the fuck are you

       are you thinking?        

01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:24.252
- Just put the fucking gun down,

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:26.755
I'll go get some stuff from Dom.

01:05:26.757 --> 01:05:27.756

  So give me the fucking cash.  

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:31.259

       You don't have it?       

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:38.099
 - I don't have the cash, they  
 fucking robbed me, that's why! 

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:41.102
  - Dirtbag, you have any cash  
  from your bottles and cans?   

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.438
 - I got cash back in my dorm.

          - Your dorm.          

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:46.942
 Where might that be, Harvard?  

01:05:46.944 --> 01:05:48.109
             - USC.             

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.111
     - [Eddie] USC, you're      
        a stitch, hobo.         

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:52.447

      like you go to USC.       

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:58.620
   - Call my roommate, he'll    
    bring you the damn cash.    

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.121
    - Oh, shut up, shut up.

     You bring this fucking     
       comedian in here?        

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:04.125
      - Look at his hand,       
     he's got a gold ring.      

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.962
    - Show me, show me that.    

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:10.131
      - It's my father's,       
     gold, you can have it.     

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:12.634
 - Yeah, I know I can have it.  

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.136
 Yeah, help him, take that off  

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:19.140
    - Not until you tell me     
  where the police station is.  

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:21.142
  - Fine, I'll tell you where   
 the fucking police station is. 

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.811
       Help him take off        
       the fucking ring!        

01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:24.312
    - Just do what he says,

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.983
  Just do what he says, sorry.

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:30.318
          It's stuck.           
            - Shit.
