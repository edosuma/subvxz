03:35.623 --> 03:39.559
Frank, why don't you admit
that you're lying about this?

03:39.594 --> 03:42.085
- Why would I lie about this?
- So then you would lie.

03:42.130 --> 03:43.256
I didn't say I would lie.

03:43.298 --> 03:45.266
You just said,
"Why would I lie about this?"

03:45.300 --> 03:47.632
From which it can be inferred
that there are things...

03:47.669 --> 03:50.763
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

03:50.805 --> 03:53.103
Let's assume that somewhere,
some time in my life...

03:53.141 --> 03:55.041
I have told a lie, OK?

03:55.076 --> 03:57.670
Does that mean I'm lying now?

03:57.712 --> 04:00.545
All right, so let me
just get this straight.

04:00.582 --> 04:01.947
By all means. Just...

04:01.983 --> 04:05.475
You're telling me
that your mother...

04:05.520 --> 04:07.920
had sexual intercourse
with Frank Sinatra,

04:07.956 --> 04:09.355
and that's why
you're named Frank?

04:09.390 --> 04:10.584
That's right.

04:14.362 --> 04:17.297
- Uh-huh.
- What?

04:17.332 --> 04:18.629
And your father?

04:18.666 --> 04:20.565
He never slept with Sinatra.
It was just my mother.

04:20.601 --> 04:23.093
Does your father
know about this?

04:23.137 --> 04:25.833
He's the one who told me.
I think he knows.

04:25.873 --> 04:30.003
I can always tell
when you're bullshitting.

04:30.044 --> 04:32.478
No, you can't. That's why
I always beat you in poker.

04:32.513 --> 04:33.673
You never beat me in poker.

04:33.715 --> 04:35.012
- He always does.
- He doesn't.

04:35.049 --> 04:38.212
He always beats you and
you come home all pissed off.

04:38.252 --> 04:39.651
Does he?

04:39.687 --> 04:42.019
Don't be jumping into this.
He doesn't need your help.

04:42.056 --> 04:45.389
- He comes home crying to mommy.
- You do, sweetie!

04:47.095 --> 04:48.756
Why does this happen to me?

04:48.796 --> 04:50.491
You're always teaming up
with him.

04:50.531 --> 04:52.294
You're supposed to be
on my side.

04:52.333 --> 04:56.133
But then I would always
be wrong, too.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.331
You don't even know
what we're talking about here.

04:58.373 --> 05:00.603
Frank was named after
Frank Sinatra.

05:00.642 --> 05:02.269
- That's right.
- Yeah.

05:02.310 --> 05:04.005
You mean, you didn't know that?

05:06.814 --> 05:09.681
Did I ever tell you
what my middle name was, Joe?

05:09.717 --> 05:12.083
Sammy, right?

05:12.120 --> 05:14.247
Your mom did the wild thing
with the Candy Man, too?

05:14.288 --> 05:17.086
That's amazing.
It's Franklin Samuel.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.958
You guys are really funny.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.223
Hey.

05:54.162 --> 05:56.323
You all right?

05:56.364 --> 05:58.423
Yeah. I'm hung over.

05:58.466 --> 05:59.746
I can't believe
I have to face...

05:59.767 --> 06:02.861
a class full of
eight-year-olds tomorrow.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.872
So take the day off.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.897
Frank, I just took the week off.

06:06.941 --> 06:09.876
What's one more day
going to hurt?

06:09.911 --> 06:13.039
Someday you'll have a job,
and then you'll understand.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.946
I've had a job before.

06:30.131 --> 06:32.031
I don't even know if I do.

06:33.668 --> 06:36.102
- What's that?
- A little present.

06:36.137 --> 06:37.798
What, for me?

06:37.839 --> 06:40.603
After all these years, you're
still spoiling me like this?

06:40.641 --> 06:42.401
If you don't want it,
I can give it to Frank.

06:42.410 --> 06:45.607
- I'll take it.
- No, it's mine.

06:45.646 --> 06:48.547
Unless it's a jawbreaker.
Then you can have it.

06:48.583 --> 06:49.880
Thank you.

06:49.917 --> 06:54.081
It's a ring. That's so sweet.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.680
Yeah.

06:55.723 --> 06:59.682
- It's about time, pumpkinhead.
- It really is about time.

06:59.727 --> 07:02.127
When are we going to set
the wedding?

07:04.532 --> 07:07.194
- How about May?
- May. That's nice.

07:07.235 --> 07:09.430
May wedding.
What do you think, Frank?

07:09.470 --> 07:12.337
May works for me.
I'm off the whole month.

07:12.373 --> 07:13.863
It'd give me
a little time to shop.

07:13.908 --> 07:19.244
I guess all that's left
is for you to ask me officially.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.542
OK.

07:25.586 --> 07:31.354
Sarah, if this ring will do
until I can afford a real one...

07:33.194 --> 07:34.923
It's not funny anymore.

07:34.962 --> 07:37.123
It's not meant to be.

07:39.867 --> 07:42.028
Will you marry me?

07:50.578 --> 07:52.569
Well, say yes.

08:01.789 --> 08:05.885
OK. OK, yes. Yes.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.824
About goddamn time!

08:14.168 --> 08:17.797
Is there anyone present
who knows a reason...

08:17.839 --> 08:22.606
why these two should not be
joined in holy matrimony?

08:22.643 --> 08:26.704
Speak now
or forever hold your peace.

08:28.416 --> 08:30.475
Come on. Isn't anybody
going to help me out here?

08:30.518 --> 08:33.043
You better not do that tomorrow.

08:33.087 --> 08:35.078
You're just going to have
to wait and see.

08:35.121 --> 08:36.350
I'll kill you.

08:39.693 --> 08:42.822
And now, according
to the power vested in me,

08:42.864 --> 08:47.858
I declare this rehearsal over,
and amen.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.529
Hi, Sarah. Hi, Joseph.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.869
You know, I just want
to say congratulations,

08:52.907 --> 08:55.375
and I know
I've teased you both...

08:55.409 --> 08:58.242
about the pitfalls of marriage
throughout the years,

08:58.279 --> 09:00.804
but I just wanted to say...

09:00.848 --> 09:03.373
why didn't you listen?

09:03.417 --> 09:06.818
It's not too late. You've been
shacking up for years.

09:06.854 --> 09:09.345
It worked out perfectly.
I got a tankful of gas.

09:09.390 --> 09:12.553
We can head to
the Mexican border right now.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.858
Duane and I
would just like to wish you...

09:15.897 --> 09:20.129
all of the happiness and joy
in the world.

09:20.167 --> 09:23.295
Yes. Marriage -
it's a beautiful thing.

09:23.337 --> 09:27.239
Sarah, it's a big day tomorrow.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.270
I know you and Joseph
will be very happy together.

09:35.917 --> 09:37.646
You're a great catch.

09:37.685 --> 09:42.054
I don't know you that well,
but I've known you long enough.

09:42.089 --> 09:44.580
We've never really gotten
into any deep conversations,

09:44.625 --> 09:48.652
but I consider you a friend.

09:48.696 --> 09:52.689
And Joseph's an old friend.
And I just want you to know...

09:52.733 --> 09:56.567
that I think you two are going
to be very happy together...

09:56.604 --> 09:59.402
and make a wonderful couple.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.635
Do you have something
to say to Joseph...

10:01.676 --> 10:05.112
on the eve of the most
important day of his adult life?

10:05.146 --> 10:09.082
I think it's great
they're in love and everything.

10:09.116 --> 10:13.212
Congratulations, I guess,
are in order.

10:13.254 --> 10:16.348
Make sure you have me
over for dinner a lot.

10:16.390 --> 10:17.950
The thing about marriage,
though, man...

10:17.959 --> 10:22.020
it's not like poker where
you're sitting at a table...

10:22.063 --> 10:24.998
and you've got
a bad streak going -

10:25.032 --> 10:26.966
you can just walk away,
get out of there.

10:27.001 --> 10:30.368
But, you know, marriage is...
You got to stay there.

10:30.404 --> 10:33.100
And you keep getting bad hands
and losing money...

10:33.140 --> 10:34.835
and you lose
and you lose and you lose...

10:34.875 --> 10:38.333
and it can break you,
and you can leave with nothing.

10:38.379 --> 10:42.839
Here's the portrait
of a successful marriage.

10:42.883 --> 10:46.910
Amy, could you tell
Joseph and Sarah...

10:46.954 --> 10:52.915
what has been the key
to your successful bond?

10:52.960 --> 10:54.757
Forgiveness.

10:56.063 --> 11:00.500
You have to learn
to forgive and forget.

11:00.534 --> 11:04.561
Are there any specifics
you'd like to go into...

11:04.605 --> 11:08.439
in terms of
exercising forgiveness?

11:09.844 --> 11:11.835
There's a little
forgiveness muscle...

11:11.879 --> 11:13.972
and very few people
know about it.

11:14.015 --> 11:15.983
If you don't have it,
you're in trouble.

11:16.017 --> 11:18.884
That's right. And we've got
a little machine at home...

11:18.919 --> 11:22.787
that exercises
that forgiveness muscle.

11:22.823 --> 11:25.656
- Really?
- I'll show you ours.

11:25.693 --> 11:27.558
If you'll show me yours.

11:28.963 --> 11:30.590
OK.

11:37.805 --> 11:41.901
How have you avoided
getting hooked?

11:41.942 --> 11:43.933
How?

11:43.978 --> 11:47.436
I don't know.
I never met a woman like Sarah.

11:47.481 --> 11:51.417
What about that cover
girl/actress you were seeing?

11:51.452 --> 11:52.749
What the hell was her name?

11:52.787 --> 11:53.913
Marianne.

11:53.954 --> 11:56.047
Marianne. Whoo, boy!

11:56.090 --> 11:58.490
You should've married her, man.
She was fucking gorgeous.

11:58.526 --> 11:59.925
She was beautiful.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.053
Only problem was, once I ran
out of ways to tell her that,

12:02.096 --> 12:04.496
the relationship
sort of fizzled.

12:04.532 --> 12:06.693
But she was beautiful.

12:06.734 --> 12:09.396
Well, to the ones that got away.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.372
How about to the one...

12:12.406 --> 12:13.930
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:13.974 --> 12:15.441
Who didn't?

12:15.476 --> 12:16.636
Hear, hear.

12:21.215 --> 12:22.705
Strong enough?

12:22.750 --> 12:25.082
We're running a little short
on the bloody marriage mix.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.020
Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary.

12:28.055 --> 12:31.513
- Right.
- Right.

12:31.559 --> 12:33.493
You guys do have
a certain glow about you.

12:33.527 --> 12:35.757
Doesn't she? She's a saint, too.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.627
Please.

12:40.401 --> 12:42.460
I'm marrying the most
beautiful woman in the world!

12:42.503 --> 12:44.630
- Please, stop.
- No, not even just the world...

12:44.672 --> 12:46.401
the entire universe!

12:47.541 --> 12:49.202
I can hardly wait
till we're married.

12:49.243 --> 12:50.403
Why?

12:50.444 --> 12:52.969
Because I never have to have
sex with you again.

12:56.383 --> 12:57.748
A toast!

12:59.386 --> 13:01.183
To the bachelor's life!

13:02.490 --> 13:05.425
No. I'm kidding.
All right, to marriage.

13:05.459 --> 13:07.393
Yeah. To marriage.

13:07.428 --> 13:10.022
- To our marriage.
- To our marriage.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.994
- And to our friends.
- Yeah!

13:14.034 --> 13:16.935
To the bride and groom.

13:16.971 --> 13:20.031
May they treat each other
as well as they've treated me.

13:20.074 --> 13:21.234
Hear, hear.

13:24.044 --> 13:26.069
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

13:26.113 --> 13:28.513
Go! Go! Go!

13:28.549 --> 13:30.983
That's mature, Joseph.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.781
Excuse me.

13:39.460 --> 13:40.688
Hi.

13:43.898 --> 13:46.332
Jesus.
You'll be all right, Joey.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.165
It's not so bad.
It's only the rehearsal.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.864
Remember our wedding, honey?

13:50.905 --> 13:53.430
We got so stoned
I fell down her mother's stairs.

13:53.474 --> 13:56.238
Yeah, that was great, Duane.

13:56.277 --> 13:57.801
- I'm all right.
- Let's get out of here.

13:57.845 --> 14:00.405
- You OK?
- Yeah.

14:00.447 --> 14:03.177
God, Joseph,
don't you ever chew your food?

14:03.217 --> 14:04.844
Shut up, Nigel.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.825
Haven't seen much of you lately.

14:14.862 --> 14:16.796
Got a girl?

14:16.830 --> 14:19.355
- A couple.
- Oh, a couple.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.528
- Do they know that?
- I'm pretty obvious.

14:24.271 --> 14:26.330
I've been thinking about
moving back east.

14:26.373 --> 14:27.567
Why?

14:27.608 --> 14:30.771
I don't know.
Things have just...

14:30.811 --> 14:33.541
I don't know.
I get headaches out here.

14:33.581 --> 14:36.106
Everybody gets headaches.
It's the smog.

14:36.150 --> 14:37.344
Yeah.

14:54.468 --> 14:58.131
You know that first time
that Joe and I broke up?

15:00.074 --> 15:01.769
Which first time?

15:01.809 --> 15:05.506
The first, first time.

15:05.546 --> 15:07.377
Why are you laughing?
The first, first time.

15:07.414 --> 15:09.041
- Oh, the first, first time!
- Yeah.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.812
I'm sorry.

15:10.851 --> 15:15.845
Anyway, that first, first time
Joe and I broke up,

15:15.889 --> 15:18.915
I almost went after you.

15:20.995 --> 15:23.896
- Get out of here.
- I did. I did.

15:26.867 --> 15:29.301
You mean, after me, after me?

15:29.336 --> 15:31.531
After you.

15:31.572 --> 15:34.268
I guess it's lucky I was shy.

15:34.308 --> 15:37.607
It would be pretty
uncomfortable now, wouldn't it?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.306
We would have gotten over it.

15:41.749 --> 15:44.217
Joey would have thought
it was all about him...

15:44.251 --> 15:46.048
and once we got back together...

15:46.086 --> 15:49.078
he would have used it
to get off the hook...

15:49.123 --> 15:52.092
for whoever
he'd been screwing with.

15:52.126 --> 15:53.650
But what about me?

15:53.694 --> 15:57.186
He would've tried
to punch you, but...

15:57.231 --> 16:00.598
then you both would've gone off
together and gotten drunk.

16:04.705 --> 16:06.536
You're probably right.

16:06.573 --> 16:09.667
Yeah, I know my men.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.108
What about you and me?

16:13.147 --> 16:17.140
Us? We would've been fine.

16:18.552 --> 16:19.780
You sure?

16:19.820 --> 16:22.653
Frank... come here.

16:33.767 --> 16:37.168
See? We're still friends.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.571
Poker, poker, poker!

16:49.850 --> 16:52.216
He can still look.
A man can still look.

16:52.252 --> 16:55.346
That was no look.
That was an unadulterated ogle.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.857
- OK, I ogled.
- At your own wedding, Joe?

16:57.891 --> 16:59.620
That's to you, Ror.

16:59.660 --> 17:02.356
- To be or not to be...
- She was worthy of the ogle.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.125
Come on, Joe,
at your own wedding.

17:04.164 --> 17:05.425
You were ogling Sarah.

17:05.465 --> 17:06.660
- I was not.
- You were.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.998
I was, shamelessly.

17:09.036 --> 17:11.630
We all were. Why do you think
they wear white?

17:11.672 --> 17:13.512
So you can imagine them
as virginal and pure...

17:13.540 --> 17:15.098
and then fantasize
about defiling them.

17:15.142 --> 17:17.974
- You want to defile my wife?
- For old times' sake.

17:18.011 --> 17:19.204
We're playing poker here,
fellas.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.181
I didn't fantasize about
Deborah at your wedding.

17:22.215 --> 17:24.684
- Neither did I. Anyone?
- No.

17:24.718 --> 17:27.949
I really love these stimulating
intellectual discussions,

17:27.988 --> 17:30.422
but can we please
get through a fucking hand?

17:30.457 --> 17:32.482
- Rory!
- Just a second.

17:32.526 --> 17:34.426
It's a fucking quarter.

17:34.461 --> 17:37.021
- No. That's not the point.
- Here's a quarter.

17:37.064 --> 17:39.430
- Rory's in.
- No. No!

17:39.466 --> 17:41.764
- What have you got there?
- Four aces.

17:41.802 --> 17:43.770
- Bet or don't bet.
- Just a second.

17:43.804 --> 17:45.032
OK, Rory's out.

17:45.072 --> 17:47.768
No, wait a minute!
I'm in! Jesus!

17:49.009 --> 17:52.001
You live on the edge.
I call. Show your cards.

17:52.045 --> 17:53.637
- Three tens.
- I'm slaughtered.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.477
Straight.

17:55.516 --> 17:56.744
I'm out.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.617
Straight, queen high.
What do you got, Rory?

17:59.653 --> 18:02.315
- Nothing.
- You got to show.

18:02.356 --> 18:03.653
I don't beat a straight.

18:03.690 --> 18:05.419
I called you.
You've got to show your cards.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.984
- What's it to you?
- It's the rules.

18:08.028 --> 18:10.622
It's a game.

18:10.664 --> 18:12.859
Ante up.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.562
A pair of queens? You stayed in
with a pair of fucking queens?

18:15.602 --> 18:17.331
Alas, poor Yorick.

18:17.371 --> 18:18.861
What do you get
so damn serious about?

18:18.906 --> 18:20.498
Because it drives me
fucking crazy.

18:20.541 --> 18:22.839
- In Vegas...
- The Vegas speech!

18:22.876 --> 18:24.366
In Las Vegas, Nevada,

18:24.411 --> 18:26.311
they understand
the rhythm of the deal...

18:26.346 --> 18:28.143
and the sanctity of the game.

18:28.182 --> 18:33.085
Deal, Duane.
One game - seven-card stud. Pure.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.520
They play it over and over.
You feel it,

18:35.556 --> 18:37.717
like the lap of the ocean
against the shore.

18:37.758 --> 18:40.852
You sit in silence,
study strategies.

18:40.894 --> 18:43.328
None of this banter...
Whose dick is bigger than whose?

18:43.363 --> 18:44.921
When's the fucking pizza coming?

18:44.965 --> 18:47.525
When is
the fucking pizza coming?

18:51.205 --> 18:52.331
Quarter.

18:52.372 --> 18:55.398
See it, raise it.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.141
See that, raise that.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.839
See that, raise that.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.007
I'll see that quarter
and raise you another.

19:02.049 --> 19:03.243
And another.

19:03.283 --> 19:05.046
What the hell
have you got there?

19:05.085 --> 19:07.212
Not much, apparently.

19:07.254 --> 19:09.188
Joseph here
gets two aces early on...

19:09.223 --> 19:10.781
with nothing underneath
to back it up.

19:10.824 --> 19:12.291
Table talk.

19:12.326 --> 19:13.793
Thinks he's going to chase
everybody out,

19:13.827 --> 19:15.488
which he does,
but I do not balk.

19:15.529 --> 19:19.226
- Table talk.
- So, now he's got two pair...

19:19.266 --> 19:21.291
and nothing else.

19:21.335 --> 19:23.997
And me, I started out
with a pair here,

19:24.037 --> 19:26.505
which I have now turned
into three of a kind...

19:26.540 --> 19:27.905
with this card here. Voila.

19:27.941 --> 19:31.069
- Oh!
- You can't do that!

19:31.111 --> 19:33.477
Sure I can, Joe.
It's to your advantage.

19:33.514 --> 19:35.539
It is to your advantage.

19:35.582 --> 19:38.244
So, now Joe's looking
for a long shot full house...

19:38.285 --> 19:41.948
and I'm looking for
a full house or a fourth nine...

19:41.989 --> 19:44.150
of which I noticed
none showed up in the deal.

19:44.191 --> 19:46.523
Am I confident? Yes.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.687
Big man. Real mature.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.754
See you, raise you.

19:50.797 --> 19:54.358
Well, I'll just see you.

19:54.401 --> 19:57.564
I perceive
a homoerotic subtext here.

19:57.604 --> 19:59.003
Deal, Duane.

20:00.207 --> 20:01.731
Down and dirty.

20:07.114 --> 20:11.847
Bet's to you, Joe,
and whatever you bet...

20:11.885 --> 20:13.375
I'm going to bet forty bucks.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.217
You can't do that.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.621
- Sure I can.
- No limit.

20:17.658 --> 20:19.523
- But it's my bet.
- Then bet.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.925
Then you're just going to raise.

20:20.961 --> 20:22.588
Then you know what
I'm going to do.

20:22.629 --> 20:24.062
I don't think
he's got his full house.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.291
Think what you want to think,

20:25.332 --> 20:27.664
but there is such a thing
as poker etiquette!

20:27.701 --> 20:29.566
No table talk,
no betting out of order.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.298
I've been saying this
for months.

20:31.338 --> 20:32.805
You'd be shot in Vegas, right?

20:32.839 --> 20:34.363
Yes, Frank
would be shot in Vegas.

20:34.408 --> 20:36.603
- It's not Vegas, Joe.
- But am I right?

20:36.643 --> 20:38.611
Yes, and God will punish him.
You're in or out.

20:38.645 --> 20:40.374
You're out of line.

20:40.414 --> 20:42.382
- You know the line?
- You know the line.

20:42.416 --> 20:45.317
Guys, can you finish
the fucking hand?

20:45.352 --> 20:47.616
Fifty cents.

20:48.655 --> 20:51.419
- Forty dollars.
- Fuck this. Cash me out.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.221
- Come on, Joe.
- Joseph.

20:53.260 --> 20:54.989
Fuck you guys. No, no.

20:55.028 --> 20:57.588
Frank's Mr. Big Stud,
flipping cards, betting high.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.122
He called the hand. He won.
You happy, Frank?

21:05.439 --> 21:08.897
There are our lovely hosts now.
How are you doing?

21:08.942 --> 21:10.910
Does Frank want a wienie?

21:10.944 --> 21:13.105
Frank's been a wienie
for a long time.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.171
- Is that mine?
- No, it's mine.

21:15.215 --> 21:18.412
- Don't break it, mate.
- I won't. See you later.

21:18.452 --> 21:20.215
Bye.

21:21.388 --> 21:22.616
Now, what's this?

21:22.656 --> 21:24.248
I asked you to watch her.

21:24.291 --> 21:26.259
Fuck you. What am I, your slave?

21:26.293 --> 21:28.921
Family feud.
Are you guys fighting?

21:28.962 --> 21:32.159
Hi, Frank.
Look, honey. Your friend...

21:32.199 --> 21:34.326
She was over by the pool
all by herself.

21:34.368 --> 21:36.233
You said you'd watch her.

21:36.269 --> 21:39.067
You guys might want to think
about counseling.

21:39.106 --> 21:41.574
- Frank.
- Bye, Frank.

21:41.608 --> 21:44.771
OK. Sorry about that.

21:44.811 --> 21:46.369
Hello.

21:46.413 --> 21:49.507
Hi, guys.

21:49.549 --> 21:52.814
Hey, hey, hey.

21:52.853 --> 21:56.050
Lauren, we're being harassed
by some guy with a camera.

21:56.089 --> 21:58.148
I'm not harassing anybody.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.659
He's not harassing anyone,
he says.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.423
What are you doing here?

22:02.462 --> 22:04.396
I'm taking your picture.

22:04.431 --> 22:06.422
He's over here trying
to get pictures...

22:06.466 --> 22:09.026
of half-naked girls
without any make-up on.

22:09.069 --> 22:10.969
Come on. Be nice.

22:11.004 --> 22:12.665
What's this for?

22:12.706 --> 22:16.506
- It's for...
- Personal use?

22:16.543 --> 22:18.204
Is it about something?

22:18.245 --> 22:19.473
It's for personal use.

22:19.513 --> 22:22.073
Are you doing it
so you can stare at us later?

22:22.115 --> 22:23.343
It's about the party.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.317
Really? That sounds boring.

22:25.352 --> 22:28.446
- It's also about me.
- That would be interesting.

22:28.488 --> 22:30.183
- You think so?
- Yeah.

22:30.223 --> 22:33.124
I think it would be interesting.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.492
Give me the camera.
I want to do you.

22:35.529 --> 22:38.089
- Why?
- Because I like you.

22:38.131 --> 22:40.122
I don't think
I want to give it to you.

22:40.167 --> 22:42.965
Oh, no, no, no!

22:43.003 --> 22:44.994
Don't film me.

22:45.038 --> 22:47.404
Now... is it on?

22:47.441 --> 22:49.500
Is this thing on?

22:49.543 --> 22:52.205
- Do you see me?
- Yeah.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.735
Then it's on.

22:53.780 --> 22:57.079
OK. Right, right.

22:57.117 --> 22:59.847
Tell us about your life.

22:59.886 --> 23:01.717
This actually wasn't about me.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.053
It's actually about
the party out there.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.786
Tell us about your life anyway.

23:05.826 --> 23:07.726
Why don't you film...

23:08.995 --> 23:10.587
All right, I admit it.

23:10.630 --> 23:12.461
I don't have a life.

23:12.499 --> 23:13.989
You're breaking my heart.

23:14.034 --> 23:17.128
Are you one of
those cynical people?

23:17.170 --> 23:21.436
No. More like bitter.

23:21.475 --> 23:24.069
Really? Why is that?

23:24.111 --> 23:26.170
I don't know. I'm just...

23:26.213 --> 23:28.807
It must be a girl.
It's always a girl.

23:28.849 --> 23:32.808
- Lauren, you're a goddess!
- Female prophet.

23:32.853 --> 23:35.686
You're a woman's woman.
You know, girl.

23:35.722 --> 23:37.087
- Is it?
- What?

23:37.124 --> 23:39.592
- A girl.
- No.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.287
I think it is a girl.

23:41.328 --> 23:43.262
We have a girl problem here.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.923
Why is it that girls
always think...

23:44.965 --> 23:50.062
Did you love her
and then she left you?

23:50.103 --> 23:52.230
I told you there is no problem.

23:52.272 --> 23:54.240
Oh, yeah. I don't believe you.

23:54.274 --> 23:57.732
Hi, sweetie.
You making new friends?

23:57.778 --> 24:00.576
Hi. Are you making a movie?

24:00.614 --> 24:03.708
No, we're not. He is.
We're just helping out.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.741
Do you have a statement to make?

24:05.786 --> 24:07.879
No, I don't think so.

24:07.921 --> 24:10.253
I think you better
keep on filming him.

24:10.290 --> 24:12.315
Make your peace
with your public.

24:12.359 --> 24:13.656
Sorry. Bye.

24:13.693 --> 24:15.183
Walk that runway, girl.

24:15.228 --> 24:17.594
Work that vest. There you go.

24:17.631 --> 24:19.189
- Is that her?
- Who?

24:19.232 --> 24:21.063
The girl who left you?

24:21.101 --> 24:23.501
There's no girl.
Give me the camera.

24:23.537 --> 24:26.802
I think that's somebody who
hasn't been returning my calls.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.102
Because I'm mad at you.

24:28.141 --> 24:29.699
- Why?
- You piss me off.

24:29.743 --> 24:32.371
What do you mean,
I piss you off?

24:32.412 --> 24:35.540
You got to watch out
for that unresolved resentment.

24:35.582 --> 24:38.551
It can cause diseases.
I'm sure you've heard that.

24:38.585 --> 24:40.177
Have you thought of therapy?

24:40.220 --> 24:41.847
I'm in therapy twice a week.

24:41.888 --> 24:43.219
- You're kidding me.
- No.

24:43.256 --> 24:44.553
What do you talk about?

24:44.591 --> 24:46.957
All we talk about is you -
it's weird -

24:46.993 --> 24:49.894
and what a dick you are
but how much I like you anyway.

24:49.930 --> 24:51.454
That makes me feel a lot better.

24:51.498 --> 24:53.489
- Whose camera is that?
- It's mine.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.932
That's not your camera.

24:54.968 --> 24:57.402
You can't afford that
because you're such a loser.

24:57.437 --> 24:59.428
Why don't you eat me, Joe?

24:59.472 --> 25:01.030
OK.

25:01.074 --> 25:03.599
- Oh, no. Go away.
- What do you want?

25:03.643 --> 25:06.168
- I hate this.
- Take that thing off my face.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.477
I just want
to have a conversation.

25:08.515 --> 25:10.244
You want me to say
something quotable?

25:10.283 --> 25:13.912
Yeah, why don't you say
something quotable?

25:13.954 --> 25:17.412
I'll give you more later.
Over and out.

25:17.457 --> 25:21.052
Nigel, come on. See you, Nigel.

25:21.094 --> 25:22.459
Good-bye, Frank.

25:22.529 --> 25:23.621
Hello.

25:23.663 --> 25:26.029
Oh, no. No, please, don't.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.260
What's the matter?

25:27.300 --> 25:29.530
I don't like the way I look.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.469
I sound like a man
on those things.

25:31.504 --> 25:32.971
You don't sound like a man.

25:33.006 --> 25:34.303
I do, I do.

25:34.341 --> 25:36.309
Wait till you listen to it.

25:36.343 --> 25:38.903
"She sounds just like me".

25:38.945 --> 25:40.572
- Nice.
- Yeah.

25:40.614 --> 25:44.482
Before, you sounded like
your normal, velvet-voiced self.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.583
Is this why you came here?

25:50.624 --> 25:52.819
No, I came to see you.

25:52.859 --> 25:55.760
Then take that thing away
from your face.

25:58.398 --> 26:00.764
Yes, Frank,
what can I do for you?

26:00.800 --> 26:02.768
Why don't you...

26:02.802 --> 26:05.430
tell me all about me?

26:05.472 --> 26:08.566
Really?
The stuff you want to hear...

26:08.608 --> 26:10.576
or the stuff
you don't want to hear?

26:10.610 --> 26:12.134
Just tell me everything.

26:12.178 --> 26:13.475
I don't know everything.

26:13.513 --> 26:17.540
Then tell me what you know.

26:17.584 --> 26:19.882
Starting from when?

26:19.920 --> 26:21.182
From the beginning.

26:21.221 --> 26:23.121
I don't know you
from the beginning, honey.

26:23.156 --> 26:25.590
I only know you from the middle.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.957
Then how about from there?

26:30.530 --> 26:32.361
You're being so weird.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.527
Why don't you just say
whatever pops into your mind?

26:37.570 --> 26:39.231
The first thing. Whatever.

26:39.272 --> 26:42.332
This is...
Do I really have to do this?

26:42.375 --> 26:44.969
I don't think so. Why?

26:45.011 --> 26:47.502
Because I asked you
as a favor to me.

26:47.547 --> 26:49.640
See, that's it.

26:49.683 --> 26:51.583
You want me to tell you
all about you.

26:51.618 --> 26:53.950
I don't see you
since the wedding,

26:53.987 --> 26:56.581
then you show up
out of no place and expect me...

26:56.623 --> 26:59.615
to tell you all about you
as a favor to you.

26:59.659 --> 27:01.684
I think that just about
wraps it up.

27:01.728 --> 27:04.492
- You think so?
- I do. Give me that.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.431
Tell me something about you.

27:10.470 --> 27:12.836
Tell me something
about something.

27:12.872 --> 27:14.100
OK.

27:14.140 --> 27:16.768
OK? God, just a minute.

27:16.810 --> 27:19.404
How about...

27:19.446 --> 27:21.505
How about the first time
I saw you?

27:21.548 --> 27:23.277
I already know that.

27:23.316 --> 27:27.082
No, you don't.
I mean before we met.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.020
The first, first time.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.751
There was a first, first time?

27:36.396 --> 27:38.990
OK, tell me about that.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.226
OK.

27:42.969 --> 27:45.767
When...

27:45.805 --> 27:47.773
- What?
- OK.

27:47.807 --> 27:49.934
I was...

27:49.976 --> 27:52.945
I was about to take
my last test...

27:52.979 --> 27:55.607
my sophomore year...

27:55.648 --> 27:57.081
and...

27:58.952 --> 28:02.115
It was in
English Medieval Renaissance.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.882
I was just about to go
into the building...

28:06.926 --> 28:08.689
and I saw you.

28:11.297 --> 28:13.288
It was raining out that day...

28:13.333 --> 28:15.460
and the sky was dark...

28:15.502 --> 28:17.868
and you were standing there...

28:17.904 --> 28:21.635
in this long gray raincoat.

28:21.674 --> 28:24.905
You had this green umbrella.

28:24.944 --> 28:27.970
And, I don't know,
it was just strange.

28:28.014 --> 28:29.982
Everything was dark,
and there you were...

28:30.016 --> 28:31.677
with this green umbrella.

28:31.718 --> 28:33.549
And...

28:35.555 --> 28:37.853
And then the sky
was starting to break,

28:37.891 --> 28:42.521
and just as the light
burst out of the sky...

28:42.562 --> 28:44.325
you did the neatest thing...

28:44.364 --> 28:46.423
You twirled your umbrella
a little bit...

28:46.466 --> 28:47.956
and caught the light.

28:48.001 --> 28:49.832
You were
the most beautiful thing...

28:49.869 --> 28:52.201
I'd ever seen in my life.

28:57.844 --> 29:01.280
And then...

29:01.314 --> 29:03.305
then Joseph came
out of the building...

29:03.349 --> 29:06.341
and he...

29:06.386 --> 29:11.153
He went clomping up to you
like Gene Kelly in...

29:11.191 --> 29:12.681
"Singin' in the Rain".

29:12.725 --> 29:15.193
He was clomping
through the puddles...

29:15.228 --> 29:18.254
and that's when...

29:21.501 --> 29:23.492
I don't remember that.

29:27.707 --> 29:30.369
That's because
we didn't know each other then.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.446
It was really funny.

29:34.481 --> 29:37.143
The next semester
when I came back...

29:37.183 --> 29:40.277
and Joseph was my roommate...

29:40.320 --> 29:42.083
and you were his girlfriend.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.932
- Frank?
- Frank-o!

30:01.975 --> 30:03.465
I'm in the kitchen!

30:06.880 --> 30:09.212
I brought
some strawberries, Frank.

30:09.249 --> 30:10.716
Good.

30:10.750 --> 30:12.843
Where's the booze?

30:12.886 --> 30:14.911
- Hi, Duane.
- Where's the booze?

30:14.954 --> 30:16.114
You know where the booze is.

30:16.156 --> 30:18.989
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. How are you?

30:19.025 --> 30:21.550
- You look like shit, Frank.
- Thank you, Deborah.

30:21.594 --> 30:24.154
You're welcome.
Where's your date?

30:24.197 --> 30:25.562
She's not here yet.

30:25.598 --> 30:28.123
Told you he wouldn't
have a date.

30:28.168 --> 30:30.068
Who is she?

30:30.103 --> 30:31.934
Ran into Marianne.

30:31.971 --> 30:33.768
Cover girl? She's coming here?

30:33.806 --> 30:34.966
Yeah.

30:35.008 --> 30:38.671
Like us to leave you alone
for a few minutes, Duane?

30:38.711 --> 30:40.838
I haven't seen her
in a long time, that's all.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.814
Look at his face.

30:46.719 --> 30:51.383
Is she your girlfriend again,
Frank?

30:51.424 --> 30:54.450
No, she's not my girlfriend.
She's a date.

31:31.164 --> 31:33.155
I don't know.

31:33.199 --> 31:37.226
I've had sex before -
more than once -

31:37.270 --> 31:39.431
and I think
I've figured out why I do it.

31:39.472 --> 31:40.962
Go ahead, Joe.

31:41.007 --> 31:43.669
I remember going
through the birth canal.

31:43.710 --> 31:45.405
- Oh, God.
- No, I'm...

31:45.445 --> 31:47.970
My skin was really
sensitive back then...

31:48.014 --> 31:49.379
Want some wine?

31:49.415 --> 31:51.713
It was like
I was one big, giant penis.

31:51.751 --> 31:53.343
Nothing's changed, Joseph.

31:53.386 --> 31:55.616
No, no. Pay attention, please.

31:55.655 --> 31:58.215
There I was
in the birth canal...

31:58.258 --> 32:02.592
and my adrenaline
was really pumping...

32:02.629 --> 32:05.621
and these dark, wet,
powerful muscles...

32:05.665 --> 32:06.859
were shunting me...

32:06.899 --> 32:09.868
and elongating my head
into a banana shape...

32:09.902 --> 32:12.029
which is a very odd sensation.

32:12.071 --> 32:14.869
And imagine the kind of
consciousness you have...

32:14.907 --> 32:18.035
when you're getting oxygen,
but you're not breathing.

32:18.077 --> 32:20.068
You're just alive.

32:22.382 --> 32:24.407
So now that I'm a big boy...

32:24.450 --> 32:28.978
I find myself going back
to that place again and again...

32:29.022 --> 32:33.186
because it's only really
just before I blow my wad...

32:33.226 --> 32:34.454
Dear God.

32:34.494 --> 32:38.760
That I ever experience
what it was like being born.

32:38.798 --> 32:42.131
- That is so amazing.
- Isn't it?

32:42.168 --> 32:44.295
It's incredible
you remember being born.

32:44.337 --> 32:47.397
One of my boyfriends
is a licensed rebirther.

32:47.440 --> 32:48.668
Really?

32:48.708 --> 32:51.199
He's trying to regress me
back to the womb,

32:51.244 --> 32:53.678
but it's been
really difficult for me.

32:53.713 --> 32:55.772
Why?

32:57.317 --> 33:00.946
I think it's because infants
are so helpless...

33:00.987 --> 33:04.423
and I need to be in control.

33:07.794 --> 33:10.024
So, Marianne,

33:10.063 --> 33:12.429
how many boyfriends
do you have, anyway?

33:12.465 --> 33:13.625
Honey, please, that's...

33:13.666 --> 33:15.327
How many men do I have sex with?

33:15.368 --> 33:17.768
Yeah, I'm just curious.

33:17.804 --> 33:20.364
More than one.

33:20.406 --> 33:23.307
- Congratulations, Frank.
- Thanks, Sarah.

33:23.343 --> 33:25.743
Girl fight.

33:25.778 --> 33:30.306
Is that two or a few...

33:30.350 --> 33:34.684
or the Los Angeles Raiders?

33:34.721 --> 33:37.588
Honey, what are you doing?

33:37.623 --> 33:39.921
What are you doing?

33:42.428 --> 33:44.396
Could I have
a cigarette, please?

33:44.430 --> 33:47.092
I'm sorry if
I threaten you in some way.

33:47.133 --> 33:49.397
I happen to like men.

33:49.435 --> 33:55.305
And what is it about them,
exactly, that you like?

33:56.576 --> 33:58.976
Different things
about different men.

33:59.011 --> 34:01.878
I bet.

34:03.816 --> 34:07.217
Well, I think
that's very commendable...

34:07.253 --> 34:08.982
and rare, in my experience.

34:09.021 --> 34:11.216
Shut up, Duane.
If it's so commendable,

34:11.257 --> 34:12.952
then how come
you don't like women?

34:12.992 --> 34:14.322
Good point.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.158
I like women...
Hairless, obsequious women.

34:17.196 --> 34:19.289
You're so deep. It's true.

34:19.331 --> 34:22.266
He used to make all his
girlfriends shave their twats.

34:22.301 --> 34:24.996
You're a sick man, Duane.

34:25.036 --> 34:27.505
I don't like hair.
I like hairless girls.

34:27.540 --> 34:33.308
Girls? Like a little diaper rash
in their creases, Duane?

34:33.346 --> 34:35.906
I think you would like men
a lot less...

34:35.947 --> 34:37.677
if you were married to one.

34:37.717 --> 34:39.981
I don't know. What about Frank?

34:40.018 --> 34:41.418
He's not bad.

34:41.454 --> 34:46.619
I like Frank.
I'm just not the marrying type.

34:49.695 --> 34:54.462
Poor Frank.
Are you disappointed?

34:56.068 --> 34:58.764
Yeah, I'm devastated.

34:58.805 --> 35:03.139
You're so sweet.
Why aren't you married?

35:05.244 --> 35:07.940
I guess I haven't met
the right woman yet.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.471
What kind would that be?

35:14.020 --> 35:16.921
Like... you.

35:16.956 --> 35:18.480
One like you.

35:18.524 --> 35:20.754
You're so cute.

35:20.793 --> 35:22.226
He is so cute.

35:22.261 --> 35:24.786
Honey, I'm about to cloud up...

35:24.831 --> 35:27.732
and rain all over you.

35:27.767 --> 35:33.535
If you like me so much,
why don't you...

35:33.573 --> 35:35.666
bring me flowers?

35:35.708 --> 35:39.804
Roses? Would you like roses?

35:39.846 --> 35:43.304
Which grow profusely in the...

35:43.349 --> 35:45.010
ordure of romance.

35:45.051 --> 35:47.713
What the hell's going on here?

35:50.223 --> 35:54.683
I'm trying to tell your wife
that I'm in love with her.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.760
Frank's trying to seduce me.

35:59.799 --> 36:03.997
You're trying to seduce me,
aren't you, Frank?

36:05.671 --> 36:08.196
I love you, Sarah.

36:08.241 --> 36:10.505
What the fuck are you doing?

36:10.543 --> 36:12.204
What the fuck is going on here?

36:12.245 --> 36:13.803
Are you nuts? That's my wife!

36:13.846 --> 36:15.507
What's your fucking problem?

36:15.548 --> 36:17.539
Go, Frank.

36:17.583 --> 36:19.551
Go!

36:19.585 --> 36:21.143
Thanks so much for dinner.

36:21.187 --> 36:23.781
It was so nice seeing you all.

36:23.823 --> 36:25.654
Take it easy, Marianne.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.745
Want a cigarette?

36:52.952 --> 36:54.510
Thanks.

37:12.138 --> 37:13.537
Is it me?

37:15.374 --> 37:17.808
No. Sometimes being married...

37:17.843 --> 37:19.811
is like having
dog shit on your shoe...

37:19.845 --> 37:22.837
and nothing
to scrape it off with.

37:27.086 --> 37:29.145
Want to play some ball tomorrow?

37:30.690 --> 37:32.681
You want more humiliation?

37:34.627 --> 37:38.188
I'll pick you up tomorrow
at 6:00, all right?

37:38.230 --> 37:40.721
How's your marriage
counseling going?

37:42.034 --> 37:44.628
It's good. It's all right.

37:44.670 --> 37:46.831
You like your counselor?

37:46.872 --> 37:49.306
Yeah, she's all right.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.210
You know what she said to me
the other day?

37:56.248 --> 37:59.649
She said
I was full of inner rage.

37:59.685 --> 38:01.448
You believe that shit?

38:01.487 --> 38:05.514
I should have popped her
right then. Bitch.

38:05.558 --> 38:07.082
Duane!

38:08.327 --> 38:11.626
You begin to hate
the sound of your own name.

38:11.664 --> 38:15.031
- Honey, come on.
- OK.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.599
You'll be all right, man.

38:18.638 --> 38:20.936
- See you later.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

38:45.464 --> 38:47.659
I want to drive.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.861
Why?

38:49.902 --> 38:54.100
I just think
it'll be a good idea.

38:54.140 --> 38:57.473
I'm sorry, honey. I didn't...

38:58.611 --> 39:00.374
You piss me off.

39:17.897 --> 39:21.162
And, Daddy,
she didn't deserve it

39:21.200 --> 39:24.897
All the pain and the hurt

39:24.937 --> 39:28.703
And I could
never hate you for it

39:28.741 --> 39:32.472
'Cause I learned about love
when she said

39:32.511 --> 39:36.345
She said, "Honey,
your daddy is dead to me"

39:36.382 --> 39:40.113
"But to you,
your daddy he'll always be"

39:40.152 --> 39:44.145
"And although he made me
cry my last tear"

39:44.190 --> 39:47.557
"To you,
he should always be dear"

39:47.593 --> 39:48.855
And Mother

39:48.894 --> 39:52.193
You're the kindest woman
I've ever seen

39:52.231 --> 39:55.166
A love like yours is rarely seen

39:55.201 --> 39:57.192
And although you were hurt

39:57.236 --> 39:59.329
You held your head high

39:59.371 --> 40:01.339
And thanks to you

40:01.373 --> 40:06.367
My daddy's alive

40:09.815 --> 40:12.716
- All right.
- Thank you.

40:12.752 --> 40:14.720
Thank you, thank you.

40:14.754 --> 40:17.222
- I wrote that myself.
- I could tell.

40:17.256 --> 40:18.985
Did you like it?

40:20.025 --> 40:22.550
- It was very human.
- Thank you.

40:22.595 --> 40:25.462
- Let's play poker.
- All right.

40:25.498 --> 40:28.228
- Got any eights?
- Nope. Go fish.

40:28.267 --> 40:31.600
- Come on.
- We're just being cute.

40:31.637 --> 40:34.572
We'll be serious.

40:34.607 --> 40:38.270
You've got the old maid,
don't you?

40:38.310 --> 40:41.541
Why am I always the last one
to hear about these things?

40:41.580 --> 40:42.877
I thought we were friends.

40:42.915 --> 40:44.439
We are friends.
That's why we didn't tell you.

40:44.483 --> 40:47.611
We didn't want to shatter
your fragile fantasy world.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.587
Did they hurt each other?

40:49.622 --> 40:50.953
You are so dear.

40:50.990 --> 40:54.357
They didn't hurt each other,
because I was Mr. Peacemaker.

40:54.393 --> 40:57.157
I wanted to pop
the son of a bitch myself.

40:57.196 --> 40:59.756
See, that really upsets me.

40:59.799 --> 41:02.427
You can't look at her cards.
You're still in the hand.

41:02.468 --> 41:04.402
Sorry. Hold on to that ace.

41:04.436 --> 41:06.165
Great. Ruin my bluff.

41:06.205 --> 41:08.139
What's a bluff?

41:08.174 --> 41:10.506
When you lie about your hand
and chase everyone else out.

41:10.543 --> 41:11.737
Gotcha.

41:11.777 --> 41:13.768
How do you know I wasn't
bluffing about her ace?

41:13.813 --> 41:16.077
Because you can't bluff
someone else's hand.

41:16.115 --> 41:17.878
Why not, Neil?

41:17.917 --> 41:19.475
Because you can't.

41:19.518 --> 41:21.213
Does it confuse you?

41:21.253 --> 41:23.414
No, it doesn't confuse me.

41:23.455 --> 41:25.184
And my name's Leo, not Neil.

41:25.224 --> 41:27.624
Why are you angry?

41:27.660 --> 41:29.184
I'm not angry.

41:29.228 --> 41:31.788
Bet big, girl.
He's angry and confused.

41:31.831 --> 41:33.560
I bet all my chips.

41:33.599 --> 41:35.965
You can't bet out of turn.

41:36.001 --> 41:39.698
When it's my turn,
the chips will be there.

41:39.738 --> 41:43.174
I'm sorry, but this Frank thing
is really upsetting me.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.837
- You're so sensitive.
- Come sit between us.

41:45.878 --> 41:48.506
A little drama's
good for a marriage.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.208
But they're best friends.

41:50.249 --> 41:52.046
Frank is her friend.

41:52.084 --> 41:54.848
We're friends.
Where does that leave me?

41:54.887 --> 41:56.047
Who's Frank?

41:56.088 --> 41:58.648
That guy shooting down our tops
at the barbecue.

41:58.691 --> 42:00.318
He was kind of cute.

42:00.359 --> 42:02.327
It's your bet, sweetheart.

42:02.361 --> 42:06.422
OK, big cock. Here's my bet.

42:08.033 --> 42:09.933
I think that Frank guy
needs to get laid.

42:09.969 --> 42:12.164
Precisely. He's chosen
his best friend's wife...

42:12.204 --> 42:14.229
as the object
of his clumsy affections.

42:14.273 --> 42:15.740
That's wonderful, Nigel.

42:15.774 --> 42:17.002
What?

42:17.042 --> 42:18.737
These girls don't need
to hear about that, man.

42:18.777 --> 42:22.076
These girls
are my trusted employees.

42:22.114 --> 42:24.912
They won't breathe a word.
They can keep a secret.

42:24.950 --> 42:26.076
Promise.

42:26.118 --> 42:28.086
Cross my heart, hope to die.

42:31.423 --> 42:33.414
Anyway, it sounds like
amateur dinner theater...

42:33.459 --> 42:34.619
Frank being Frank.

42:34.660 --> 42:36.287
Now, that confuses me.

42:36.328 --> 42:39.422
Am I supposed
to be angry at Frank?

42:39.465 --> 42:42.093
He's a slime hound
with warts on his dick.

42:42.134 --> 42:44.967
- So you guys are friends.
- Exactly.

42:45.004 --> 42:47.336
You should do
that guy Frank, Lauren.

42:47.373 --> 42:48.806
I don't know.

42:48.841 --> 42:51.071
I checked him out.
He looked kind of small.

42:51.110 --> 42:53.908
I need a big stiff one,
and I don't mean a cocktail!

42:53.946 --> 42:56.471
Oh, my God!
I think I just grew a penis!

42:56.515 --> 42:59.245
Poker will do it to you
every time!

42:59.285 --> 43:01.515
It's raining sperm in here!
Oh, my face!

43:01.553 --> 43:05.182
- Cross your legs!
- Oh, yes!

43:07.760 --> 43:09.990
So you're really angry at him.

43:10.029 --> 43:12.395
I don't want
to waste my time on it.

43:12.431 --> 43:13.631
I don't want to talk about it.

43:13.666 --> 43:15.361
A man who gleefully admits...

43:15.401 --> 43:17.266
having had sex
with his sister...

43:17.303 --> 43:19.396
is now making moral judgments.

43:19.438 --> 43:22.430
- What?
- You had sex with your sister?

43:22.474 --> 43:25.966
She was five. I was four.
It was consensual.

43:26.011 --> 43:29.538
That's what allows me to make
these higher moral judgments.

43:29.581 --> 43:32.448
- I'm evolved.
- I see.

43:32.484 --> 43:34.349
I think I'm mad at him.

43:34.386 --> 43:37.878
Congratulations, Rory.
You've picked an emotion.

43:37.923 --> 43:41.825
I have this weird, crazy idea.
Let's play poker.

43:41.860 --> 43:46.627
No, no, no. What do you think?

43:46.665 --> 43:49.463
I think that you are
chronically indecisive,

43:49.501 --> 43:50.900
Duane's overreacting,

43:50.936 --> 43:53.063
Frank is lonely and sad,

43:53.105 --> 43:55.164
and I am getting impatient.

43:55.207 --> 43:57.641
You have
a lot of hostility in you.

43:57.676 --> 44:01.134
I've also got two pairs
towards a full house.

44:01.180 --> 44:04.149
The thing is -
and I'll leave it at this -

44:04.183 --> 44:07.482
is that you guys can't know,
because you're not married.

44:07.519 --> 44:09.043
I'm married, Duane.

44:09.088 --> 44:11.488
That's stretching
the definition a bit, isn't it?

44:11.523 --> 44:13.991
I believe I should be insulted.

44:14.026 --> 44:15.857
Shall I be angry with you now?

44:15.894 --> 44:18.692
Dog fight.

44:18.731 --> 44:20.460
I'm secure in my marriage.

44:20.499 --> 44:22.592
Whatever, Nigel.

44:22.634 --> 44:24.067
Nobody wake him up.

44:24.103 --> 44:26.765
What foreign creature
crawled up your rectum?

44:26.805 --> 44:29.103
A kiss is just a kiss.

44:29.141 --> 44:31.109
To demonstrate...

44:33.412 --> 44:35.073
See? No harm done.

44:36.648 --> 44:40.345
Don't you ever, ever
do that again, Nigel,

44:40.386 --> 44:42.354
unless I ask for it,
or I'm hard up.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.288
That hurt.

44:44.323 --> 44:47.952
Good. I'm glad. Good.

44:47.993 --> 44:49.483
My point is...

44:49.528 --> 44:51.325
What if I told Amy about this?

44:51.363 --> 44:54.025
Exactly.
Tell her, and we'll endure.

44:54.066 --> 44:58.298
They'll endure
if we all love one another.

44:58.337 --> 45:00.931
Nigel, you're so full
of insight and charm.

45:00.973 --> 45:04.204
You really are. No, I'm serious.

45:10.315 --> 45:14.979
This game is boring.
Nothing happens.

45:15.020 --> 45:16.851
Do you want
to hear another song?

45:16.889 --> 45:18.584
I got eight more that I wrote.

45:18.624 --> 45:20.819
Let her play. It's nice.

45:23.829 --> 45:25.490
Once again

45:25.531 --> 45:29.194
I'm without my man

45:29.234 --> 45:34.069
My lover and my friend

45:41.180 --> 45:43.171
Mine are hardly
the sort of novels...

45:43.215 --> 45:46.878
today's filmmakers
are racing to adapt.

45:46.919 --> 45:50.355
They're not seething
with raw sensuality...

45:50.389 --> 45:52.016
nor do they contain...

45:52.057 --> 45:56.960
periodic spasms
of orgiastic bloodshed.

45:56.995 --> 45:58.929
Also, one rarely sees...

45:58.964 --> 46:02.730
characters as old as mine
in American films,

46:02.768 --> 46:04.759
and when they do pop up...

46:04.803 --> 46:07.465
it's only for a scene or two.

46:07.506 --> 46:10.839
They're not allowed to be
the whole story...

46:10.876 --> 46:12.810
as they are in my books.

46:12.845 --> 46:15.370
Though, now that I think of it,

46:15.414 --> 46:18.781
I was approached
perhaps 20 years ago...

46:18.817 --> 46:22.685
by some people who wanted
to film my third book,

46:22.721 --> 46:27.522
which was called
"A Vulgar Superfluity".

46:27.559 --> 46:32.496
Although they suggested
I try to think of another title.

46:32.531 --> 46:33.862
They wanted to cast...

46:33.899 --> 46:36.663
some American actress
whom I'd never heard of,

46:36.702 --> 46:40.798
though she was apparently
quite popular at the time.

46:40.839 --> 46:42.966
They showed me
one of her films...

46:43.008 --> 46:45.340
and I thought, "Oh, dear."

46:45.377 --> 46:49.245
"She's quite
immensely unsuitable".

46:49.281 --> 46:51.613
Her name escapes me now.

46:51.650 --> 46:55.279
Amy, dear, what was the name
of that actress...

46:55.320 --> 46:57.982
they were so keen
to have play Daphne?

46:58.023 --> 46:59.752
Raquel Welch.

46:59.791 --> 47:02.521
Yes, that's it!

47:02.561 --> 47:04.654
Oh, dear, yes.

47:04.696 --> 47:06.391
That is one boring lady
in there.

47:06.431 --> 47:08.058
She's like
some kind of hypnotist.

47:08.100 --> 47:10.625
You think she's bad,
try reading one of her books.

47:10.669 --> 47:12.109
Though don't mix them
with alcohol...

47:12.137 --> 47:14.037
as people have been known
to slip into comas.

47:14.072 --> 47:16.006
What's Amy's dad like?
Is he as bad?

47:16.041 --> 47:19.374
Her dad's great.
He ran for his life years ago.

47:19.411 --> 47:21.379
She married
this aging closet case...

47:21.413 --> 47:22.971
who's probably
in London right now,

47:23.015 --> 47:24.778
working his way through
the male ensemble...

47:24.816 --> 47:25.942
of "Starlight Express".

47:25.984 --> 47:28.976
- Fucking Nigel.
- He's fine.

47:29.021 --> 47:31.012
He has to sit there,
sneering at her...

47:31.056 --> 47:34.787
like she's in any danger
of forgetting he hates her guts.

47:34.826 --> 47:36.453
He's just jealous.

47:36.495 --> 47:39.862
Deeply.
Not that he'd ever admit it.

47:39.898 --> 47:41.729
And there's the money thing.

47:41.767 --> 47:44.327
Her bailing us out last year.

47:44.369 --> 47:47.304
I think it's really going fine.

47:47.339 --> 47:49.534
Sounds like you and Mom
don't get along too well.

47:49.575 --> 47:53.306
No. She thinks of me
as some disgusting habit...

47:53.345 --> 47:55.609
Amy will outgrow someday,
like thumb-sucking.

47:55.647 --> 47:57.581
Her expectations of me
have gotten so low...

47:57.616 --> 47:59.243
that it's actually
something of a challenge...

47:59.284 --> 48:02.447
to disappoint her,
but I do my best.

48:02.487 --> 48:03.784
This is really strong.

48:03.822 --> 48:05.289
I've been saving it
for her visit.

48:05.324 --> 48:07.292
How much longer
is she sticking around for?

48:07.326 --> 48:10.523
Ten days.
I have a strange premonition...

48:10.562 --> 48:12.530
she'll decide
to shorten her visit.

48:12.564 --> 48:13.929
Really?

48:13.966 --> 48:15.991
Nigel, are you in there?

48:16.034 --> 48:18.502
No, don't come in!

48:18.537 --> 48:19.970
Your guest just showed up.

48:20.005 --> 48:21.472
I suppose
you think you're funny?

48:21.506 --> 48:24.805
I'm stoned.
I think everything's funny.

48:24.843 --> 48:27.676
- Thank you for that.
- Who's here?

48:27.713 --> 48:31.274
You should enjoy this.
He invited Frank.

48:31.316 --> 48:33.784
- Frank is here?
- What'd you do that for?

48:33.819 --> 48:34.979
He's my friend, too.

48:35.020 --> 48:36.920
You can't expect me
to shun him for your sake.

48:36.955 --> 48:38.149
I hate you.

48:38.190 --> 48:39.953
I think you two
should kiss and make up.

48:39.992 --> 48:41.391
Or beat the crap
out of each other.

48:41.426 --> 48:42.893
That would be interesting, too.

48:42.928 --> 48:45.692
You're so clever, Nigel.
You really are.

48:45.764 --> 48:48.324
It's very nice
to meet you, Frank.

48:48.367 --> 48:49.800
Nice to meet you as well.

48:49.835 --> 48:52.360
I really enjoy your books.

48:52.404 --> 48:55.373
How kind of you to say so.

48:55.407 --> 48:57.307
This is Pamela.

48:57.342 --> 48:59.105
Hi. Nice meeting you.

48:59.144 --> 49:02.204
How do you do?
Are you a friend of Amy's?

49:02.247 --> 49:03.441
Who's Amy?

49:03.482 --> 49:05.382
No. Actually,
I'm a friend of Nigel's.

49:05.417 --> 49:06.714
We play poker together.

49:06.752 --> 49:10.017
Oh, I see.

49:10.055 --> 49:13.149
Help yourself to some tea...

49:13.191 --> 49:15.557
or there's champagne,
if you'd prefer.

49:15.594 --> 49:16.959
Thank you.

49:16.995 --> 49:18.462
Thank you.

49:18.497 --> 49:19.896
Hi, I'm Pamela.

49:19.931 --> 49:21.159
Deborah.

49:21.199 --> 49:23.167
Hi. Nice meeting you.

49:23.201 --> 49:26.068
- Hi, Pamela. I'm Duane.
- Hello, Duane.

49:26.104 --> 49:27.731
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

49:27.773 --> 49:29.900
What nice little sandwiches.

49:29.941 --> 49:32.705
Champagne crisis.

49:32.744 --> 49:35.144
- I'll get it.
- No, allow me.

49:35.180 --> 49:36.374
Really!

49:36.415 --> 49:40.613
- Hi, I'm Athena.
- Lauren. Great scarf.

49:40.652 --> 49:41.880
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

49:41.920 --> 49:44.582
This is Josh.

49:44.623 --> 49:47.217
Hi.

49:47.259 --> 49:52.253
So, are you
working on a new book?

49:52.297 --> 49:55.664
Yes. I'm perhaps
halfway through.

49:55.701 --> 49:57.168
- Great.
- What's it about?

49:57.202 --> 49:59.568
It's a minor
superstition of mine...

49:59.604 --> 50:03.597
never to discuss my books
until I finish writing them,

50:03.642 --> 50:06.042
not even with my husband.

50:06.078 --> 50:10.242
It has at times been a source
of some friction between us.

50:10.282 --> 50:11.613
I wouldn't have thought...

50:11.650 --> 50:14.483
there was any friction at all
between you and Sydney.

50:14.519 --> 50:17.511
Perhaps you don't know us
as well as you suppose.

50:17.556 --> 50:18.955
Frank, can I talk to you
in the kitchen?

50:18.990 --> 50:20.190
There's nothing to talk about.

50:20.225 --> 50:21.658
No, there's a lot to talk about.

50:21.693 --> 50:23.251
What the hell's going on here?

50:23.295 --> 50:26.093
- I want to talk to you.
- Were you two an item?

50:26.131 --> 50:27.758
I would like to...

50:27.799 --> 50:29.630
I want you to control yourself.

50:29.668 --> 50:31.533
I'm not the one
who can't control himself!

50:31.570 --> 50:32.798
Keep your voice down.

50:32.838 --> 50:34.169
Did you know
he was going be here?

50:34.206 --> 50:35.639
Is that why we had to come
to this thing?

50:35.674 --> 50:37.164
If I wanted to see him,

50:37.209 --> 50:39.109
this is how I would arrange it?

50:39.144 --> 50:41.874
Excuse me. Would you mind
going somewhere else?

50:41.913 --> 50:43.141
I was here first.

50:43.181 --> 50:45.149
He's following you around
with a big fucking hard-on,

50:45.183 --> 50:46.445
and I'm not supposed
to say anything?

50:46.485 --> 50:49.750
So, Pamela,
what sort of work do you do?

50:49.788 --> 50:51.380
You think
he came here for the tea?

50:51.423 --> 50:52.583
No. He's here
because you're here.

50:52.624 --> 50:54.785
That's the only reason,
and everyone knows it...

50:54.826 --> 50:56.726
and you know it,
and it's embarrassing.

50:56.762 --> 50:58.696
I don't like it.
You think I'm enjoying...

50:58.730 --> 51:00.254
I do think you enjoy this!

51:00.298 --> 51:02.766
You're the center of attention.
Everyone's looking at you.

51:02.801 --> 51:05.964
Fuck you, Joe!
I did not ask for this.

51:06.004 --> 51:07.995
Neither did I,
which is why we're leaving.

51:08.039 --> 51:09.973
No, fuck you!
You don't tell me what to do!

51:10.008 --> 51:11.441
If you want to go, you go!

51:11.476 --> 51:12.773
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

51:12.811 --> 51:14.176
At the moment, I would love it.

51:14.212 --> 51:15.770
I would fucking love it.

51:25.657 --> 51:27.625
I am sorry about that.

51:27.659 --> 51:29.058
I'm really sorry.

51:29.094 --> 51:30.925
It's hardly your fault, dear.

51:30.962 --> 51:35.194
It's just Nigel showing us all
how Nigel he can be.

51:35.233 --> 51:38.964
And what exactly
do you mean by that?

51:39.004 --> 51:42.667
I do not enjoy speaking to you
when you are drunk.

51:42.707 --> 51:45.904
Thank you.
That's very useful information.

51:45.944 --> 51:48.435
Shut up, Nigel.

51:51.416 --> 51:52.576
He's going?

51:52.617 --> 51:56.519
Son of a bi...
He left with my date!

51:56.555 --> 51:58.022
What?

51:59.524 --> 52:01.719
You people are fucking sick!

52:01.760 --> 52:04.456
Oh, dear.

52:04.496 --> 52:06.054
Thanks for having us.

52:06.097 --> 52:07.621
Thank you for coming.

52:07.666 --> 52:11.898
- Hey! Fuck!
- Josh!

52:11.937 --> 52:13.700
Are these people
really your friends?

52:13.738 --> 52:14.898
Because they're not normal.

52:14.940 --> 52:16.305
You shouldn't be so sensitive.

52:16.341 --> 52:18.172
I'm so sorry.

52:18.210 --> 52:20.872
Darling,
if you would like my advice...

52:20.912 --> 52:22.709
No, we would not
like your advice.

52:22.747 --> 52:24.681
Not with that farce
you call a marriage.

52:24.716 --> 52:26.115
Stop it! Nigel!

52:26.151 --> 52:29.279
I will not stay in this house
one minute longer!

52:29.321 --> 52:31.789
I'm timing you.

52:31.823 --> 52:34.451
59... 58...

52:34.493 --> 52:36.120
Shut up!

52:36.161 --> 52:38.095
You are a nasty boy!

52:38.129 --> 52:42.088
55... 54... 53...

52:43.401 --> 52:44.959
Sally, pick up the phone.

52:45.003 --> 52:46.561
Sally.

52:46.605 --> 52:48.630
Stop it, Nigel!

52:48.673 --> 52:51.267
Caroline, I'm a very nasty boy.

52:51.309 --> 52:52.833
I want a divorce!

52:52.878 --> 52:54.607
Frank?

52:56.281 --> 52:58.340
You know things
are getting pretty bad...

52:58.383 --> 53:00.544
when we have
the best marriage in the room.

53:17.068 --> 53:20.902
I hope you don't think
you're going to sleep with me.

53:20.939 --> 53:22.566
What?

53:22.607 --> 53:26.475
I hope you don't think
you're going to sleep with me.

53:26.511 --> 53:29.480
Actually,
it hadn't crossed my mind.

53:29.514 --> 53:31.675
Oh, really?

53:31.716 --> 53:33.946
- I'm happily married.
- I know.

53:33.985 --> 53:36.783
That son of a bitch.
He's such a fucking...

53:36.821 --> 53:38.686
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be talking like this.

53:38.723 --> 53:40.987
We're all sorry.
You're sorry, right, Frank?

53:41.026 --> 53:43.051
I'm going to
take you home first, OK?

53:43.094 --> 53:44.891
OK, thank you.

53:44.930 --> 53:46.158
Sarah...

53:46.197 --> 53:48.188
No, Frank, please don't start.

53:48.233 --> 53:50.360
- I just...
- Forget it. Please?

53:53.738 --> 53:56.206
So, what kind of work do you do?

53:56.241 --> 53:59.733
Me? I'm a body double
for Demi Moore.

53:59.778 --> 54:01.040
Really? That's really...

54:01.079 --> 54:03.912
She believes me. Oh, my God.

54:03.949 --> 54:05.678
You didn't have to come with us.

54:05.717 --> 54:07.548
There's no reason
for this attitude.

54:07.586 --> 54:09.315
Look, honey, I came with him.

54:09.354 --> 54:12.346
Everybody else was sloshed,
stoned, or psychotic...

54:12.390 --> 54:14.358
and a cab in this town
is 50 bucks.

54:14.392 --> 54:17.088
Yada, yada, yada.
God, she goes on.

54:17.128 --> 54:19.562
All right.
He'll take me home. Great.

54:19.598 --> 54:20.929
Sarah, can I just...

54:20.966 --> 54:24.163
Frank, no!
I'm OK. I'm really OK.

54:24.202 --> 54:26.432
I do have control over my life.

54:26.471 --> 54:28.268
It might not seem that way,
but I do.

54:28.306 --> 54:29.603
I am not stupid.

54:29.641 --> 54:32.166
I know Joseph's an asshole,
but I married him.

54:32.210 --> 54:33.541
He's my asshole.

54:35.513 --> 54:37.310
See that house?

54:37.349 --> 54:39.180
I designed the landscaping.

54:39.217 --> 54:41.014
It's nice.

54:41.052 --> 54:43.020
It's better than nice.

54:43.054 --> 54:45.147
The dopes that live there
don't deserve it.

54:45.190 --> 54:46.555
That's the rub,

54:46.591 --> 54:49.287
that only rich people
can really afford...

54:49.327 --> 54:50.954
property
that's worth landscaping...

54:50.996 --> 54:52.623
but then they don't
even care about it.

54:52.664 --> 54:55.292
It's like upkeep to them,
maintenance,

54:55.333 --> 54:58.700
like I'm changing
shingles on their roof.

54:58.737 --> 55:01.365
So you're an artist, then.

55:01.406 --> 55:03.374
Sometimes.

55:03.408 --> 55:05.376
And the rest of the time?

55:05.410 --> 55:09.005
You mean,
what do I do for money?

55:09.047 --> 55:12.039
I design landscaping.

55:18.590 --> 55:22.185
I like that green mushroom tree.

55:22.227 --> 55:25.628
- It's an umbrella.
- You're kidding.

55:25.664 --> 55:28.189
I did it for my wife.

55:28.233 --> 55:29.825
Does she know?

55:29.868 --> 55:32.598
I drove her by it once.

55:32.637 --> 55:34.867
Like an inside joke, huh?

55:34.906 --> 55:36.237
Sort of.

55:39.577 --> 55:42.478
Did you ever think
that maybe you made a mistake?

55:42.514 --> 55:44.141
What are you talking about?

55:44.182 --> 55:46.343
Marrying him.

55:46.384 --> 55:48.352
How can you say that?
I loved him.

55:48.386 --> 55:50.183
"Loved".
That's exactly what I'm saying.

55:50.221 --> 55:51.620
That's past tense, you see?

55:51.656 --> 55:53.123
Frank, stop.

55:53.158 --> 55:54.420
What...

55:54.459 --> 55:58.589
- Sarah, I love you now.
- Hello!

55:58.630 --> 56:01.531
Frank, you got to understand.

56:01.566 --> 56:03.659
We're just friends.
That's all we are.

56:03.702 --> 56:06.364
Come on. We've always been
more than friends.

56:06.404 --> 56:08.099
You know that as well as I do.

56:08.139 --> 56:10.505
And I want you now, OK?

56:10.542 --> 56:13.102
You want me now
because now I'm taken.

56:13.144 --> 56:15.112
You only ever want what's taken.

56:15.146 --> 56:16.579
That is such bullshit!

56:16.614 --> 56:18.673
No, it isn't.
That's a pattern with you.

56:18.717 --> 56:20.651
You waited until after
we were married...

56:20.685 --> 56:22.448
I waited till you let me!

56:22.487 --> 56:23.749
- I let you?
- Yes!

56:23.788 --> 56:25.187
How?

56:27.726 --> 56:31.628
The day before the wedding,
when you kissed me.

56:31.663 --> 56:33.426
You kissed?

56:33.465 --> 56:36.298
Does the bimbo
with your husband know...

56:36.334 --> 56:37.631
- Shut up!
- OK.

56:37.669 --> 56:40.001
Frank, that was just a kiss.

56:46.244 --> 56:48.109
I'm only here...

56:48.146 --> 56:50.979
because my best friend
is trying to fuck my wife.

56:51.015 --> 56:53.313
Maybe he's in love with her.

56:53.351 --> 56:55.581
He doesn't really even know her.

56:57.388 --> 56:58.855
Why not? You're best friends.

56:58.890 --> 57:00.881
They must see each other a lot.

57:00.925 --> 57:02.358
Yeah.

57:03.661 --> 57:06.391
Then he does know her.

57:06.431 --> 57:07.921
No.

57:11.669 --> 57:13.398
She married me.

57:20.979 --> 57:22.207
Oh, God.

57:31.556 --> 57:33.717
She's probably with him
right now.

57:33.758 --> 57:37.319
No. She's just not with me.

57:37.362 --> 57:40.229
That's right. I'm with you.

57:49.440 --> 57:52.409
You really want me to pull over
and drop you off?

57:52.443 --> 57:53.933
Is that what you want?

57:57.949 --> 57:59.849
You people are unbelievable.

57:59.884 --> 58:02.216
You just do this
to entertain yourselves?

58:02.253 --> 58:05.711
Don't answer that.
It's a rhetorical question.

58:33.651 --> 58:35.619
Let's go to my bedroom.

58:41.459 --> 58:44.087
Let's go to my bedroom.

58:44.128 --> 58:45.595
You know what?

58:45.630 --> 58:48.064
You're sweet, but this is...

58:48.099 --> 58:49.828
You're fucked up.

58:49.868 --> 58:53.964
No, I'm not. I'm 24,
and I don't give a shit.

58:54.005 --> 58:56.997
None of you mean anything to me.

58:57.041 --> 58:58.770
That's sad.

58:58.810 --> 59:00.801
You would know.

59:03.114 --> 59:05.605
I got to go. I'm sorry.

01:00:30.101 --> 01:00:32.729
Your husband
is a really hot property.

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:35.637
Have you always known
that the big guy here...

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:37.004
was going to make it so big?

01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:38.303
Of course.

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:40.538
It was just a matter of time
before Hollywood realized...

01:00:40.578 --> 01:00:43.206
that adolescent wish fulfillment
was the way to go.

01:00:43.247 --> 01:00:44.475
Thanks, sweetie.

01:00:44.515 --> 01:00:46.039
I'm in
the agent training program.

01:00:46.084 --> 01:00:47.949
I heard he got half a mil.

01:00:47.986 --> 01:00:51.888
- For a first spec script?
- Not bad.

01:00:51.923 --> 01:00:53.788
Is it Duane or Wayne?

01:00:53.825 --> 01:00:56.885
Who the fuck are these people?

01:00:56.928 --> 01:00:58.520
I think she's on TV.

01:00:58.563 --> 01:01:00.030
Oh, yeah.

01:01:00.064 --> 01:01:02.089
I never slept with a girl
that's been on TV.

01:01:02.133 --> 01:01:06.160
That girl on "Jeopardy!"
What was her name?

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.764
That was after we broke up.

01:01:08.806 --> 01:01:10.865
- I'm Sid.
- Amy.

01:01:10.908 --> 01:01:12.705
Hi, Amy. How you doing?

01:01:12.744 --> 01:01:15.372
I just...

01:01:15.413 --> 01:01:17.779
You know how
when you're at a party...

01:01:17.815 --> 01:01:20.409
you go from pocket
to pocket of people?

01:01:20.451 --> 01:01:22.783
You don't know these people.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.219
So I'm just hanging around,

01:01:24.255 --> 01:01:25.882
waiting for a hole
in the conversation.

01:01:25.923 --> 01:01:28.153
And you had to listen to how
I met my husband.

01:01:28.192 --> 01:01:31.389
No. I'm glad to hear about
how you met your ex-husband.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.540
We should get the guys
together and go to Vegas.

01:01:44.575 --> 01:01:47.100
- I'm serious.
- You'd want Duane to pay.

01:01:47.145 --> 01:01:48.407
He would spring for it.

01:01:48.446 --> 01:01:49.970
You just use your friends.

01:01:50.014 --> 01:01:52.073
Don't you feel bad about
using your friends like that?

01:01:52.116 --> 01:01:54.311
We would all be able to go.
We'd have a great time.

01:01:54.352 --> 01:01:55.910
Duane's made out of money now.

01:01:55.953 --> 01:01:59.116
Let's just sap him
for everything he's worth?

01:01:59.157 --> 01:02:01.216
The girl's a great part.

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:03.159
Yeah, I actually wrote it...

01:02:03.194 --> 01:02:06.789
as sort of a cross between
my wife and Betty Rubble.

01:02:06.831 --> 01:02:08.924
- Really?
- No, it's true.

01:02:08.966 --> 01:02:12.367
I want to ask you something
about what you were saying.

01:02:12.403 --> 01:02:14.598
Is that like...
Is that ancient history...

01:02:14.639 --> 01:02:16.539
or is that recent history?

01:02:16.574 --> 01:02:18.735
- Do you need help?
- No, no.

01:02:18.776 --> 01:02:21.574
I'm actually... Ancient enough.

01:02:21.612 --> 01:02:24.843
Do I have to mingle,
or are you coming back?

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:31.320
You're really tan.

01:02:31.355 --> 01:02:33.186
You go to the beach a lot?

01:02:33.224 --> 01:02:35.021
Yeah, I do.

01:02:35.059 --> 01:02:39.325
Out of curiosity,
do you shave or wax your legs?

01:02:39.363 --> 01:02:40.728
I wax.

01:02:40.765 --> 01:02:43.359
- Really?
- Yes.

01:02:43.401 --> 01:02:46.063
Bikini line?

01:02:46.104 --> 01:02:49.096
I wax my bikini line, yes.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.734
Did you ever think,
what the fuck...

01:02:51.776 --> 01:02:55.439
and just wax it all off?

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.141
Actually, you know what?

01:02:57.181 --> 01:03:00.480
That would be painful.

01:03:00.518 --> 01:03:04.511
But I do shave the actual area
to get that kind of...

01:03:04.555 --> 01:03:07.922
smooth effect.
You know what I mean?

01:03:07.959 --> 01:03:10.826
Does that make you
uncomfortable?

01:03:10.862 --> 01:03:12.955
No.

01:03:12.997 --> 01:03:16.228
It's kind of
an odd question, really.

01:03:16.267 --> 01:03:17.791
What makes the script so good...

01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:20.668
is that it's the woman's movie,
yet it's still manly.

01:03:20.705 --> 01:03:22.570
I'm a little new at
this script analysis stuff,

01:03:22.607 --> 01:03:24.165
but I think your husband
has something that...

01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:25.539
Could you excuse me
for a minute?

01:03:25.576 --> 01:03:27.373
Sure. I'll talk to you later.

01:03:27.411 --> 01:03:29.538
Haven't they locked you up yet?

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.276
It's good to see you, too,
Deborah.

01:03:32.316 --> 01:03:35.251
Frank, I realize
that crashing parties...

01:03:35.286 --> 01:03:37.618
is the only thing you have
for a social life,

01:03:37.655 --> 01:03:38.849
but not tonight.

01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:41.188
I came to congratulate
my friend...

01:03:41.225 --> 01:03:44.717
and to give him this.
Is that OK with you?

01:03:44.762 --> 01:03:47.322
It's a nice bottle.
Thanks, Frank.

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:50.266
I'm sure
Duane will appreciate it.

01:03:50.301 --> 01:03:51.598
Drive safely now, OK?

01:03:51.636 --> 01:03:53.297
Did I do something to you?

01:03:53.337 --> 01:03:57.068
Get some help, Frank.
She's married.

01:03:57.108 --> 01:03:59.338
Have a nice party, Deborah.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.472
Bye, Frank.

01:04:08.152 --> 01:04:09.847
What's the film about?
What's it really about?

01:04:09.887 --> 01:04:11.286
What genre
does it take place in?

01:04:11.322 --> 01:04:14.189
What, the spine?
Like one sentence?

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:16.887
"Boy meets girl".
I don't give a shit about that.

01:04:16.928 --> 01:04:18.589
Fuck "Boy meets girl"
Fuck "Motorcycle movie".

01:04:18.629 --> 01:04:20.859
No. What is really being said?

01:04:20.898 --> 01:04:22.331
That's what
you were talking about.

01:04:22.366 --> 01:04:24.698
The whole idea, man,
is subversion -

01:04:24.735 --> 01:04:26.965
you want subversion
on a massive level.

01:04:27.004 --> 01:04:28.869
You know what one of
the greatest fucking scripts...

01:04:28.906 --> 01:04:30.965
ever written in the history
of Hollywood is?

01:04:31.008 --> 01:04:32.703
- What?
- "Top Gun".

01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:35.405
- Come on.
- "Top Gun" is fucking great.

01:04:35.446 --> 01:04:38.711
What is "Top Gun"? A story about
a bunch of fighter pilots?

01:04:38.749 --> 01:04:41.775
It's about a bunch of guys
waving their dicks around.

01:04:41.819 --> 01:04:44.185
It is a story
about a man's struggle...

01:04:44.222 --> 01:04:46.417
with his own homosexuality.

01:04:46.457 --> 01:04:48.891
I'm serious.
That is what "Top Gun" is about.

01:04:48.926 --> 01:04:50.826
You've got Maverick, all right?

01:04:50.861 --> 01:04:52.021
He's on the edge, man.

01:04:52.063 --> 01:04:53.928
He's right on the fucking line.

01:04:53.965 --> 01:04:56.456
And you got
Iceman and all his crew.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.765
They're gay.
They represent the gay man.

01:04:59.804 --> 01:05:02.102
And they're saying,
"Go the gay way".

01:05:02.139 --> 01:05:03.663
He could go both ways.

01:05:03.708 --> 01:05:06.609
- What about Kelly McGillis?
- She's heterosexuality.

01:05:06.644 --> 01:05:08.942
She's saying, "No, no, no.
Go the normal way."

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.675
"Play by the rules.
Go the normal way".

01:05:10.715 --> 01:05:12.342
And they're saying,
"No. Go the gay way.

01:05:12.383 --> 01:05:14.078
"Be the gay way.
Go for the gay way".

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:16.484
That is what's going on
throughout that whole movie.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.818
What is this party?
Who are these people?

01:05:18.856 --> 01:05:21.290
They make me sick. What is that?

01:05:21.325 --> 01:05:25.421
Who are you? What is he wearing?

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:30.730
It's some dance jumpsuit,
freakish little gaucho...

01:05:30.768 --> 01:05:34.864
"Let's go to Spain and dance
with our arms over our heads".

01:05:34.905 --> 01:05:36.338
He goes to her house, right?

01:05:36.374 --> 01:05:37.841
It looks like
they're going to have sex.

01:05:37.875 --> 01:05:39.843
They're sitting back.
He's taking a shower.

01:05:39.877 --> 01:05:41.003
They don't have sex.

01:05:41.045 --> 01:05:42.376
He gets on the motorcycle,
drives away.

01:05:42.413 --> 01:05:44.381
She's like, "What the fuck
is going on here?"

01:05:44.415 --> 01:05:48.181
Next scene you see her,
she's in the elevator.

01:05:48.219 --> 01:05:49.481
She is dressed like a guy!

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.455
She's got the cap on,
the aviator glasses,

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:55.254
she's wearing the same jacket
that the Iceman wears.

01:05:55.293 --> 01:05:57.193
She says, "This is
how I'm going to get this guy."

01:05:57.228 --> 01:05:58.627
"This guy's going towards
the gay way.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:00.927
"So I gotta bring him back
from the gay way.

01:06:00.965 --> 01:06:02.660
"So I'll do that
through subterfuge.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.190
"I'll dress like a man".

01:06:04.235 --> 01:06:08.194
That is how she approaches it.

01:06:08.239 --> 01:06:12.175
Let me ask you - if I may digress
for two seconds here...

01:06:12.209 --> 01:06:14.177
I met this girl Amy here.

01:06:14.211 --> 01:06:16.008
She's floating around here
and everything.

01:06:16.047 --> 01:06:18.015
She just got divorced, right?

01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:21.177
I saw you on... What was it?

01:06:21.218 --> 01:06:22.583
I was asking my friend.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.212
I can't remember.

01:06:24.255 --> 01:06:25.916
You know...

01:06:25.956 --> 01:06:28.322
There's just a little...

01:06:33.631 --> 01:06:35.121
I'm... I'm lucky.

01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:36.724
We're going to drink
a pot of coffee...

01:06:36.767 --> 01:06:38.735
and then drive to Vegas.
You want to go?

01:06:38.769 --> 01:06:41.431
- What's her problem?
- She doesn't want to go.

01:06:41.472 --> 01:06:43.599
She doesn't like to gamble.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.521
- Hang on.
- Sorry.

01:07:18.442 --> 01:07:20.410
We need to have a little talk.

01:07:20.444 --> 01:07:23.470
I know, but this
really isn't the best time.

01:07:23.514 --> 01:07:25.414
Is this inconvenient for you?

01:07:25.449 --> 01:07:26.780
I could leave if you'd like.

01:07:26.817 --> 01:07:30.719
- I'll call you.
- Should I come back? OK.

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.017
What are you doing?

01:07:32.056 --> 01:07:34.581
You answer me one thing.
Right now.

01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:36.923
Maybe it was my imagination,
or maybe I dreamt it,

01:07:36.961 --> 01:07:38.519
but was it not
exactly six days ago...

01:07:38.562 --> 01:07:39.961
that we made
the most incredible love...

01:07:39.997 --> 01:07:41.487
and you told me
that you loved me?

01:07:41.532 --> 01:07:43.022
Was it or not?

01:07:44.301 --> 01:07:45.598
Sarah, how's it going?

01:07:45.636 --> 01:07:46.836
- Hi.
- You having a good time?

01:07:46.837 --> 01:07:48.498
Oh, yeah.

01:07:48.539 --> 01:07:50.871
Can I double-check
something with you?

01:07:50.908 --> 01:07:53.843
Do you see anything in my teeth?

01:07:55.312 --> 01:07:57.212
No.

01:07:57.248 --> 01:08:00.308
I didn't, either.
Nice schmooze-fest, huh?

01:08:02.119 --> 01:08:03.450
Is everything OK?

01:08:03.487 --> 01:08:06.718
Great. I'm just hanging.

01:08:06.757 --> 01:08:09.817
Oh, OK.

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.487
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:08:11.529 --> 01:08:14.862
- See you later.
- OK. Bye, Rory.

01:08:14.899 --> 01:08:16.957
Bye.

01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:20.761
You have to go now.

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:24.036
Did it happen or not?

01:08:24.073 --> 01:08:25.734
It happened.

01:08:25.776 --> 01:08:27.037
Well, thank God,

01:08:27.077 --> 01:08:30.011
because I was starting
to think I went insane.

01:08:30.046 --> 01:08:33.073
I told you I need some time.

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:37.921
Sarah, it doesn't take six days
to pack your bags.

01:08:37.955 --> 01:08:39.649
It does if
you keep unpacking them.

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:41.020
It's right through there.

01:08:43.294 --> 01:08:44.488
You waiting?

01:08:44.528 --> 01:08:46.689
Waiting? Yeah!

01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:50.063
And after that,
I'm going back into the party...

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:53.536
and I'm not going
to talk to you again tonight.

01:08:53.571 --> 01:08:56.540
OK.

01:08:56.573 --> 01:08:58.064
Do I know you?

01:08:59.743 --> 01:09:01.233
No.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:04.178
OK.

01:09:09.453 --> 01:09:11.216
Yeah.

01:09:11.255 --> 01:09:13.348
Yeah, I'm still here.

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:17.383
Jesus Christ! God!

01:09:19.263 --> 01:09:22.232
There's a man with a beard
coming through the window!

01:09:22.265 --> 01:09:26.930
Jesus! Jesus Christ! No, I'm...

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:29.404
Sarah,
I'm not leaving without you.

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:31.533
Dennis Hopper just climbed
through the window.

01:09:31.575 --> 01:09:34.840
- You can't keep doing this!
- Doing what?

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:37.279
Hiding the fact that your
marriage is a piece of paper...

01:09:37.314 --> 01:09:39.145
and you and I
are flesh and blood!

01:09:39.183 --> 01:09:40.649
This is something
out of "Fatal Attraction".

01:09:40.684 --> 01:09:42.777
No. There's this weird woman
in the bathroom.

01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:44.787
Excuse me, but could you
take that outside?

01:09:44.822 --> 01:09:46.881
I'm waiting
to go to the bathroom.

01:09:46.924 --> 01:09:50.256
- Could you please get out?
- Out! Come here.

01:09:50.294 --> 01:09:52.386
Thank you very, very much!

01:09:52.429 --> 01:09:54.624
Look, come here.

01:09:54.665 --> 01:09:56.633
What the hell's the matter
with you?

01:09:56.667 --> 01:09:59.966
Yeah, OK, so we slept together.

01:10:00.004 --> 01:10:03.167
It was great,
but that doesn't mean...

01:10:03.207 --> 01:10:05.971
it wasn't a huge mistake,
you know?

01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:07.534
That's what you call it?
A mistake?

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:10.012
Look at us right now.
We're in Duane's bathroom,

01:10:10.047 --> 01:10:11.947
at a party
you weren't invited to.

01:10:11.982 --> 01:10:13.882
I think this qualifies
as a mistake.

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:15.044
Then why did you sleep with me?

01:10:15.085 --> 01:10:17.553
Why did you tell me
about the green umbrella?

01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:18.748
You asked me about it.

01:10:18.789 --> 01:10:21.121
No, you forced me to.
And you want to know what?

01:10:21.158 --> 01:10:23.285
We aren't talking about
your umbrella or Joe's umbrella.

01:10:23.327 --> 01:10:24.988
We're talking about
my fucking umbrella.

01:10:25.029 --> 01:10:28.692
And it wasn't even my umbrella.
It belonged to my friend.

01:10:28.732 --> 01:10:30.495
I don't give a shit
about the umbrella!

01:10:30.534 --> 01:10:33.594
I'm in love with you.
Don't you understand that?

01:10:33.637 --> 01:10:34.831
That doesn't give you
the license...

01:10:34.872 --> 01:10:36.567
to do any stupid thing
that comes into your head.

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:38.438
This is not stupid.

01:10:41.078 --> 01:10:45.242
I just... I'm sorry.

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:48.513
I want to kiss you
without feeling guilty.

01:10:48.552 --> 01:10:50.076
You know?

01:10:51.689 --> 01:10:54.317
All right. Fair enough.

01:10:54.358 --> 01:10:57.691
How much time do you need?

01:10:57.728 --> 01:11:00.526
Would you go away?

01:11:00.564 --> 01:11:02.191
Honey?

01:11:04.568 --> 01:11:07.002
I'm sorry. I thought
you were the phone guy.

01:11:07.037 --> 01:11:10.939
I'll be right out.

01:11:12.176 --> 01:11:14.337
Honey, I want to get out
of here pretty soon.

01:11:14.378 --> 01:11:18.041
I'll meet you at the front door
in a few minutes.

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:21.177
Are you all right?

01:11:21.218 --> 01:11:24.949
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.890
I'm fine. I just...
I have a little...

01:11:27.925 --> 01:11:29.916
Could you have Deborah
come here?

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.928
Honey, what's going on?

01:11:31.962 --> 01:11:35.489
It's a woman thing, honey.
You don't want to know.

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:38.131
OK.

01:11:38.168 --> 01:11:39.533
OK.

01:11:49.113 --> 01:11:50.978
You've got to get out.

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:52.380
Where am I going to go?

01:11:54.551 --> 01:11:57.714
Get in. Get back in there!

01:12:06.964 --> 01:12:08.932
- Hello?
- Hi.

01:12:08.966 --> 01:12:11.093
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:12:14.338 --> 01:12:16.533
- Frank?
- Yeah.

01:12:19.843 --> 01:12:21.708
Frank, come out here.

01:12:23.047 --> 01:12:24.537
Frank!

01:12:32.189 --> 01:12:34.987
Frank,
go out the way you came in.

01:12:35.025 --> 01:12:37.323
I'll call you.

01:12:38.962 --> 01:12:40.224
Thanks for having me.

01:12:40.264 --> 01:12:42.494
Thanks for stopping by.

01:12:42.533 --> 01:12:45.127
Are you OK?

01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:47.296
Yeah.

01:12:47.337 --> 01:12:49.328
Fuck, I don't know what I am.

01:12:49.373 --> 01:12:51.034
Hi.

01:12:54.411 --> 01:12:55.969
What's happening?

01:12:56.013 --> 01:12:59.449
My life is fucked.

01:12:59.483 --> 01:13:00.677
But the real ending
of the movie...

01:13:00.718 --> 01:13:02.618
is when they fight the MIGs
at the end.

01:13:02.653 --> 01:13:04.780
Because he has passed over
into the gay way.

01:13:04.822 --> 01:13:07.586
They are this gay
fighting fucking force,

01:13:07.624 --> 01:13:10.457
and they're
beating the Russians.

01:13:10.494 --> 01:13:12.724
And it's over,
and they fucking land,

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:15.459
and Iceman's been trying
to get Maverick the entire time.

01:13:15.499 --> 01:13:17.091
Finally, he's got him,
all right?

01:13:17.134 --> 01:13:19.466
What is the last fucking line
that they have together?

01:13:19.503 --> 01:13:21.630
They're all hugging
and kissing and happy,

01:13:21.672 --> 01:13:23.765
and Ice comes up to Maverick,
and he says...

01:13:23.807 --> 01:13:27.607
"Man, you can
ride my tail anytime"!

01:13:27.644 --> 01:13:29.134
And what does Maverick say?

01:13:29.179 --> 01:13:31.272
"You can ride mine"!

01:13:31.315 --> 01:13:35.718
Sword fight! Sword fight!

01:13:35.753 --> 01:13:39.018
- Fucking "A," man!
- Yeah!

01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:01.600
Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me.

01:14:01.645 --> 01:14:04.136
I thought this was your car.

01:14:04.181 --> 01:14:07.207
I didn't see you at the party.

01:14:09.486 --> 01:14:12.785
Deborah wouldn't let me in.

01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:15.018
Really?

01:14:15.058 --> 01:14:16.855
Yeah.

01:14:16.894 --> 01:14:18.452
I love Deborah.

01:14:19.763 --> 01:14:24.257
She's a little abrasive
sometimes, don't you think?

01:14:24.301 --> 01:14:25.700
Yeah.

01:14:28.372 --> 01:14:30.397
I wonder how
Duane puts up with her.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:33.068
Yeah, or how
she puts up with him, huh?

01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:37.604
Yeah. They're married.

01:14:38.882 --> 01:14:45.617
That's part of
what marriage is - putting up.

01:14:48.725 --> 01:14:51.819
No, thanks. I got my own.

01:14:55.332 --> 01:14:58.062
To old friends.

01:15:11.882 --> 01:15:14.442
Your car needs some work, man.

01:15:14.484 --> 01:15:17.282
Yeah, it could definitely use
a new interior.

01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:20.654
You never knew how
to take care of your stuff, man.

01:15:24.361 --> 01:15:26.420
Well, I...

01:15:28.999 --> 01:15:31.524
What about that...

01:15:31.568 --> 01:15:33.798
that motorcycle you had...

01:15:33.837 --> 01:15:39.104
with the little speakers on it
and the fuzzy seats?

01:15:41.144 --> 01:15:43.442
That thing was trashed.

01:15:45.716 --> 01:15:46.910
Yeah.

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:50.010
- What was it like?
- What?

01:15:51.755 --> 01:15:53.780
Sleeping with my wife.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:58.156
Huh?

01:16:00.998 --> 01:16:02.625
Huh?

01:16:04.167 --> 01:16:06.260
What was it like?

01:16:08.138 --> 01:16:09.969
It's OK, man. She told me.

01:16:10.007 --> 01:16:12.601
I just want
to know what it was like.

01:16:15.812 --> 01:16:17.006
I'm in love with her, Joseph.

01:16:17.047 --> 01:16:19.572
I know that.

01:16:19.616 --> 01:16:22.710
You've made that
abundantly clear.

01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:28.217
I should have told you...

01:16:28.258 --> 01:16:30.783
No, you should not have
fucked her!

01:16:30.827 --> 01:16:32.227
That's what
you shouldn't have done!

01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:34.595
I didn't fuck her.
I made love to her.

01:16:34.631 --> 01:16:36.121
- Really?
- Yes.

01:16:36.166 --> 01:16:37.926
So sweet. Why don't you
shut up for a minute?

01:16:37.935 --> 01:16:40.267
Why don't you shut up?

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:42.670
I'm not the only one involved.
It was her choice!

01:16:42.706 --> 01:16:44.674
Really? Is that so?

01:16:44.708 --> 01:16:46.573
I seem to remember
her choosing me,

01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:47.810
but maybe I got it wrong here.

01:16:47.844 --> 01:16:50.039
Maybe I should
go ask her right now.

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.173
Why do you want
to make a big show of this?

01:16:52.215 --> 01:16:54.149
Maybe I should go ask her.
We're all here.

01:16:54.184 --> 01:16:58.177
We can fucking get this out
right now, all right?

01:16:58.221 --> 01:16:59.848
Joseph!

01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:02.324
Joseph, Joseph.

01:17:02.359 --> 01:17:03.656
What are you doing?

01:17:03.694 --> 01:17:06.128
Were you able
to stop yourself, Frank?

01:17:08.899 --> 01:17:11.094
- Sarah?
- This isn't going to help.

01:17:11.134 --> 01:17:12.999
- Joe.
- Sarah?

01:17:13.036 --> 01:17:15.300
It's your
lawful-wedded husband here!

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:16.704
I think it's time
we had a little talk!

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.968
Get the fuck off!

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:20.636
Sarah,
get your little ass out here!

01:17:20.677 --> 01:17:22.235
Kick his ass!

01:17:22.279 --> 01:17:24.804
Stop it! What are you doing?

01:17:24.848 --> 01:17:28.443
Stop it. What's your problem?
Do you have something...

01:17:28.485 --> 01:17:30.976
Frank over here informed me
that you chose him,

01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:32.454
which I find
a little confusing...

01:17:32.489 --> 01:17:33.717
because I seem to remember
you marrying me,

01:17:33.757 --> 01:17:35.850
but apparently he was
the last one to fuck you,

01:17:35.892 --> 01:17:38.360
so maybe I'm wrong!

01:17:39.529 --> 01:17:41.520
Take it home, guy.

01:17:41.565 --> 01:17:46.264
In case anybody didn't get that,
my husband over here...

01:17:46.303 --> 01:17:48.328
wants to know why
I fucked Frank over here.

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:50.966
He seems to think
that if he humiliates me,

01:17:51.008 --> 01:17:53.806
it will put me in
my fucking little place.

01:17:53.844 --> 01:17:55.402
But what
you don't understand, buddy,

01:17:55.445 --> 01:17:58.380
is I don't give a fuck,
because as far as I'm concerned,

01:17:58.415 --> 01:18:00.110
this marriage is over!

01:18:03.353 --> 01:18:04.911
Happy now?

01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:09.618
What about you?
Isn't this what you wanted?

01:18:09.659 --> 01:18:11.524
What do you think?

01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:13.893
Then who the hell's happy here?

01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:15.227
What, is it you?

01:18:15.265 --> 01:18:17.233
Frank, are you
the happy guy here?

01:18:17.267 --> 01:18:19.667
Right. I'm sorry.
You happened to fall in love.

01:18:19.703 --> 01:18:21.227
I don't want
to stand in the way...

01:18:21.271 --> 01:18:23.034
of my two best friends
falling in love,

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:25.166
so you guys go off
and live happily ever after.

01:18:25.208 --> 01:18:28.541
Joseph, fuck you. I married you.

01:18:28.578 --> 01:18:30.773
Then why did you fuck him?

01:18:30.814 --> 01:18:34.614
What about that fucking slut
you left that party with?

01:18:34.651 --> 01:18:36.983
Listen to me.
I did not fuck her.

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:39.614
I could have, but I didn't.

01:18:42.893 --> 01:18:44.690
Give me the keys.

01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:47.753
What?

01:18:47.798 --> 01:18:49.163
It's my car. Give me the keys.

01:18:49.199 --> 01:18:51.463
We're starting
the distribution of property?

01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:54.436
Give me the fucking keys!

01:18:54.471 --> 01:18:55.699
Honey, where are you going?

01:18:55.739 --> 01:18:57.400
Wherever the fuck I want!

01:18:57.441 --> 01:19:01.639
- Sarah!
- Frank, I'm sorry.

01:19:01.678 --> 01:19:05.114
This isn't me, you know.
You did this!

01:19:15.725 --> 01:19:17.215
I'm sorry, Joe.

01:19:18.728 --> 01:19:21.697
That's really special, Frank.
You fuck my wife,

01:19:21.731 --> 01:19:23.130
ruin my marriage, she dumps you,

01:19:23.166 --> 01:19:25.726
but the important thing
is that you feel bad.

01:19:31.174 --> 01:19:33.074
She stopped at the light.

01:19:50.093 --> 01:19:52.084
You son of a bitch.

01:20:09.146 --> 01:20:10.613
Sarah!

01:20:13.049 --> 01:20:14.710
Oh, God.

01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:23.857
Get in.

01:20:42.979 --> 01:20:46.779
Do you ever think that we have
too much time on our hands?

01:20:46.816 --> 01:20:48.249
With all the advances
we've made...

01:20:48.285 --> 01:20:50.185
in extending
the human life span...

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.451
that perhaps
nature's cruelest irony...

01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:57.688
is that we get progressively
stupider and stupider...

01:20:57.727 --> 01:21:00.252
with each passing generation?

01:21:00.297 --> 01:21:05.030
Someday,
we'll live for 300 years...

01:21:05.068 --> 01:21:09.835
but we won't be able
to sit still for five seconds.

01:21:12.776 --> 01:21:14.573
Just a thought.
