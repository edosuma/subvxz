00:00.866 --> 00:02.434
Welcome to "gadget corner."

00:02.435 --> 00:04.802
We're gonna show you
a lot of new products
to make you go, "wow,"

00:04.803 --> 00:08.806
And your wife go,
"how are we gonna pay
for this stuff?"

00:08.807 --> 00:11.876
Actually, tim, today's products
are something any woman

00:11.877 --> 00:14.946
Would love to have in her home,
and to demonstrate that for us

00:14.947 --> 00:18.983
Is <i>tool time's</i> very own
gadget expert, June palmer.

00:25.491 --> 00:27.826
Always nice
to have you here, June.

00:27.827 --> 00:32.030
Really?
How come I haven't been
on the show for four years?

00:34.199 --> 00:36.635
Budget problems.

00:36.636 --> 00:39.838
But we got it worked out.
Al's gonna take a cut in pay.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.507
My pay couldn't get any lower.

00:43.810 --> 00:47.345
So, June, what have you got
for us today?

00:47.346 --> 00:51.282
Well, first up
we have a "suck-a-bug."

00:54.653 --> 00:59.057
Four years and the best you can
come up with is "suck-a-bug"?

00:59.058 --> 01:02.994
It's an easy way to get rid
of those annoying pests.

01:05.697 --> 01:08.633
I see you have a bug over here.
You just turn it on...

01:08.634 --> 01:10.201
<i>(motor whirs)</i>

01:10.202 --> 01:13.437
And bye-bye, buggie!
Hey! That's pretty cool,
actually.

01:13.438 --> 01:16.107
Rechargeable, one-piece styrene.
I like that, al. Look at that!

01:16.108 --> 01:17.742
No more pest.

01:20.279 --> 01:22.814
And this little device
down here?
What's that supposed to do?

02:21.874 --> 02:24.142
Come on, dad,
we only want to sit in
for a couple of hands.

02:24.143 --> 02:27.378
No. I don't want you guys
exposed to what goes on
at a man's poker night.

02:27.379 --> 02:29.814
In other words, you don't
want us to see you lose.

02:32.651 --> 02:34.452
I don't always lose, you know!

02:34.453 --> 02:36.855
When was the last time
you won?

02:38.790 --> 02:42.793
Four years ago when he had
that gadget lady on.

02:45.164 --> 02:48.032
Funny. Don't you guys have
some homework to do?

02:48.033 --> 02:49.734
<i>(doorbell)</i>

02:49.735 --> 02:53.338
Yeah. And on your way upstairs
let my buddies in, will you,
please?

02:53.339 --> 02:57.208
Hey, girls! Hey, tim!

02:57.209 --> 03:00.144
Hey, harry, benny, al.
How you doin'?
Hey, tim!

03:00.145 --> 03:02.980
How'd you get jill to let us
play poker here tonight?

03:02.981 --> 03:04.816
She has
her book discussion group.

03:04.817 --> 03:08.986
Book discussion group?
Sounds interesting.

03:08.987 --> 03:14.259
What are they discussing?
My guess would be... Books.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.294
I just thought maybe
you were taking an interest

03:16.295 --> 03:18.563
In something that was important
to your wife.

03:18.564 --> 03:22.200
Why?
Yeah. Who cares?

03:22.201 --> 03:25.303
It's a wonder you guys
have long-term relationships
with women.

03:25.304 --> 03:28.607
No, it's a wonder we have
a long-term relationship
with you.

03:28.608 --> 03:30.875
Hi, marty.
Hi, marty.

03:30.876 --> 03:32.911
<i>(jill)</i> that must be chris!
I'll get it!

03:32.912 --> 03:36.314
Who's chris?
Some woman
in jill's psych class

03:36.315 --> 03:39.217
Who's driving her to
the book discussion group.

03:39.218 --> 03:42.887
Hey, I like brainy chicks.
You think she'd date me?

03:42.888 --> 03:45.657
Guys, this is chris.

03:48.527 --> 03:51.196
On second thought,
I don't need a date that bad.

03:53.331 --> 03:56.067
And this is my husband, tim.
How you doin'?

03:56.068 --> 03:58.069
Hi.
I've heard a lot about you.

03:58.070 --> 04:01.673
Obviously more
than I heard about you.

04:01.674 --> 04:04.208
Can I talk to my wife
in private for just a second?
Excuse us.

04:04.209 --> 04:06.210
Yeah, just a minute.

04:06.211 --> 04:08.780
That guy is a guy.

04:10.515 --> 04:14.786
You know, now that I look
at him, I think you're right.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.387
I'll see you later.

04:16.387 --> 04:19.290
Honey, you never told me
that chris was a guy.

04:19.291 --> 04:23.327
Yes, I did. We talked
about this the other day
at the hardware store.

04:23.328 --> 04:27.599
You were with me
at the hardware store?

04:27.600 --> 04:30.001
Honey, chris and I
are just friends.

04:30.002 --> 04:32.270
There's nothing for you
to worry about, ok?

04:32.271 --> 04:33.805
I'll see you later.
Ok, bye.

04:33.806 --> 04:36.507
Bye.
Don't take all his money.

04:36.508 --> 04:39.678
<i>(al)</i> have fun.
Nice to meet you, chris.

04:43.415 --> 04:47.852
All right, guys,
let's play some poker.

04:47.853 --> 04:51.255
Ok, first jack deals.
Tim, I gotta hand it to you.

04:51.256 --> 04:54.526
You're the only guy I know
that lets his wife date.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.898
She's not going on date,
all right?

04:59.899 --> 05:02.300
I wish my wife would date.

05:04.337 --> 05:08.239
Call me old-fashioned,
but I'd let my wife
go out on a date.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.443
She's not going out on a date,
all right? Everybody ante up.

05:12.444 --> 05:15.412
That's right. She's going
to a book discussion group
with a friend.

05:15.413 --> 05:17.949
I'm sure it's purely platonic.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.185
Haven't you guys ever heard
of a platonic relationship
before?

05:20.186 --> 05:23.454
Yeah. I got one with my wife.

05:25.857 --> 05:29.127
I've had many relationships
with women
who were just friends.

05:29.128 --> 05:32.230
Yeah, but not by your choice.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.999
Seven stud, high-low.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.968
Hey, tim,
let me get this straight.

05:36.969 --> 05:39.504
You're saying it doesn't bother
you that jill just walked
out of here with that guy?

05:39.505 --> 05:41.372
Will you let it go, marty?

05:41.373 --> 05:44.375
She said he's a friend,
that's what he is.
A friend. Ok?

05:44.376 --> 05:48.279
Yeah, just like she was
with that guy helpin' her
with her résumé

05:48.280 --> 05:52.050
Oh, yeah, the guy
that hit on her
right in your own house.

05:52.051 --> 05:55.052
She wasn't interested
in that guy, ok?
That was a different story.

05:55.053 --> 05:58.957
And besides he was
a lot better looking
than monkey boy here.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.393
I thought chris was
a nice-looking man.

06:06.298 --> 06:10.067
Well, maybe you want
to date him.
<i>(laughing)</i>

06:10.068 --> 06:12.103
First stakes.

06:12.104 --> 06:14.138
A buck.
Yeah, I'm in.

06:14.139 --> 06:17.742
It's something how the most
gorgeous women always wind up
going out with the ugliest guy.

06:17.743 --> 06:22.814
Yeah. Look at you, marty.
Your wife's a knockout.

06:22.815 --> 06:25.216
What are you saying?
I'm ugly?

06:25.217 --> 06:27.518
Tim, you think I'm ugly?

06:29.188 --> 06:30.822
I don't know, marty.
You got some nice features.

06:30.823 --> 06:34.859
But overall, you're a pretty
forgettable guy, really.

06:34.860 --> 06:38.229
Can we play cards, please?
Good idea, tim.

06:38.230 --> 06:41.966
Keep your mind off
your marriage problems.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.068
I don't have
"marriage problems."

06:44.069 --> 06:47.771
I beg to differ.
Another dollar.

06:47.772 --> 06:52.910
You know, if a woman like nancy
could go for a dog like marty...

06:52.911 --> 06:54.545
You're calling me a dog?

06:54.546 --> 06:57.982
...Well, then you know
that jill could go
for a guy like chris.

06:57.983 --> 07:00.919
You guys are probably right.
Having an affair with the guy,

07:00.920 --> 07:05.723
And then just to top it off,
she brings the guy back here
to meet me and my friends.

07:05.724 --> 07:07.959
She's real shrewd.

07:09.428 --> 07:12.397
I'll give her that.
Buck and a buck better.

07:12.398 --> 07:15.766
Al, you find me attractive,
don't ya?

07:25.010 --> 07:27.445
Tim? Why do you keep
lookin' at your watch?

07:27.446 --> 07:29.980
No reason.

07:29.981 --> 07:31.982
How long ago was
jill due home?

07:31.983 --> 07:34.752
64 minutes.

07:34.753 --> 07:37.221
Look, I'm sorry.
We were just giving you
a hard time tonight.

07:37.222 --> 07:41.191
Don't worry about that guy.
I'm not worried,
about that guy, marty.

07:41.192 --> 07:45.563
Ok. I want you to know
whatever happens,
I'm here for you.

07:48.567 --> 07:51.368
Thanks, marty.

07:51.369 --> 07:54.138
Well, I gotta go now.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.176
And why's that, marty?

07:58.177 --> 08:00.378
Because if I'm more
than 15 minutes late,

08:00.379 --> 08:03.281
Nancy thinks
I'm havin' an affair.

08:04.983 --> 08:07.485
Good night, marty.

08:07.486 --> 08:10.221
Mark, what are you doin' up?
I was looking for mom.

08:10.222 --> 08:12.590
Is she home from her date yet?

08:14.359 --> 08:16.461
She's not on a date!

08:16.462 --> 08:20.497
I'm sorry. You got a problem
with your homework or something?

08:20.498 --> 08:24.301
Good night, dad.
Hold on!

08:24.302 --> 08:27.171
Why is it you guys
don't think I can ever help
with the homework?

08:27.172 --> 08:29.807
Tell me what you got.
What's the problem?

08:29.808 --> 08:33.243
I have to define a pronoun.
Pronoun? That's easy.

08:33.244 --> 08:35.413
A pronoun is a noun
that gets paid

08:35.414 --> 08:39.717
For what an amateur noun
would do for free.

08:39.717 --> 08:41.986
I'll just wait for mom.

08:43.488 --> 08:45.957
Hi. Honey, what are you
still doin' up?

08:45.958 --> 08:49.660
I needed help with my homework.
I have to define a pronoun.

08:49.661 --> 08:53.798
Ok, a pronoun
is a word that takes
the place of a noun.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.667
Like, if you were to say,
"it's between you and me,"

08:56.668 --> 08:59.404
"it", "you" and "me"
would all be pronouns.

08:59.405 --> 09:04.108
Both definitions are
considered acceptable.

09:04.109 --> 09:06.511
Thanks, mom.
Will you please go to bed?

09:06.512 --> 09:08.612
Whoa, what a mess!
I'll help you clean this up.

09:08.613 --> 09:13.817
Thanks. Boy, it's a little late.
Must've been a long book, huh?

09:13.818 --> 09:16.554
No, the book club ended at ten,
but chris and I just have been

09:16.555 --> 09:19.457
Sitting out in front
in his car, talking.

09:21.693 --> 09:23.962
Sitting in front of this house
in his car, talking?

09:23.963 --> 09:26.164
Is there something wrong
with that?

09:26.165 --> 09:28.399
You're a married woman.
You shouldn't be hanging out
with single guys.

09:28.400 --> 09:33.637
Especially in a romantic spot
like a car!

09:33.638 --> 09:37.341
Tim, we were just sitting out
in the camaro talking.
It's no big deal.

09:37.342 --> 09:40.844
I don't care...
Camaro? What year?

09:45.150 --> 09:47.785
I don't know!

09:47.786 --> 09:51.789
Tim, I told you,
there is nothing going on
between chris and me.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.791
We're just friends.

09:53.792 --> 09:58.629
Honey, these days men and women
cannot be just friends.

09:58.630 --> 10:00.597
Really?

10:00.598 --> 10:03.033
What about you and heidi?
Heidi?

10:03.034 --> 10:05.837
She's not my friend,
she's a coworker.

10:05.838 --> 10:10.307
To me, heidi's just al
with less facial hair
and better physique.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.680
Right, I get 'em
mixed up myself.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.482
The point is,
I wouldn't be sittin'
parked in heidi's camaro.

10:18.483 --> 10:21.753
And if I did,
I'd know what year it was.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.687
Tim, this is
a ridiculous conversation.

10:23.688 --> 10:25.689
If you had a female friend
who shared your interests,

10:25.690 --> 10:27.525
I would not get all crazy
about it.

10:27.526 --> 10:31.362
Oh. Is that a fact?
So if I started hanging out
with this beautiful woman

10:31.363 --> 10:34.532
That knew about big-block 454s,
you'd trust me?

10:34.533 --> 10:36.667
Yeah, I would.

10:36.668 --> 10:38.736
<i>Now</i> you tell me.

10:43.474 --> 10:46.310
<i>(moaning)</i>

10:46.311 --> 10:47.878
Mm.

10:49.547 --> 10:51.281
Ah.

10:53.785 --> 10:55.853
Wilson, what are you doin' up?

10:55.854 --> 10:58.155
Well, tim, I couldn't sleep,
so I thought I'd come out

10:58.156 --> 11:00.624
And squeeze my apples.

11:04.763 --> 11:08.699
It's none of my business,
but shouldn't you be doin' that
in private?

11:08.700 --> 11:10.701
No. No, no, no, no, no.

11:10.702 --> 11:13.638
Tim, I'm squeezing my apples
to see if they're ready
to make cider.

11:13.639 --> 11:15.506
Oh! <i>(laughs)</i>

11:15.507 --> 11:18.843
Firm finger indentations
on the surface of the fruit

11:18.844 --> 11:22.947
Tells me that the apple
is ripe. Ah!

11:22.948 --> 11:25.316
You can tell just by touching.

11:25.317 --> 11:28.486
Speaking of touching, um...
Do you think it's possible for

11:28.487 --> 11:31.556
A man and woman to be friends
without it turning physical?

11:31.557 --> 11:34.859
Well, I most certainly do.
Gotta respect your opinion.

11:34.860 --> 11:38.162
Even though you are outside
squeezing your own apples.

11:41.032 --> 11:44.068
You see, many women feel
that the most important
ingredient

11:44.069 --> 11:47.472
In a fulfilled relationship
is meaningful conversation.

11:47.473 --> 11:50.541
In the words of the french
novelist, alain le sage,

11:50.542 --> 11:54.946
"the pleasure of talking is
the inextinguishable passion
of a woman."

11:54.947 --> 11:57.514
Which is why we call them
the opposite sex:

11:57.515 --> 12:00.584
We like sex
and they like the opposite.

12:02.887 --> 12:05.689
You see, tim, for a woman,
intellectual stimulation
with a man

12:05.690 --> 12:07.958
Can be the strongest bond
of all.

12:07.959 --> 12:12.229
That deep connection
allows her to think of him
as her soul mate.

12:12.230 --> 12:14.031
That sounds like
pretty heavy stuff.

12:14.032 --> 12:17.468
Oh, if you're the one
who found your soul mate, tim,
it certainly is.

12:17.469 --> 12:21.706
You're telling me a guy
can make a woman a soul mate
just by talking to her?

12:21.707 --> 12:23.607
Well, it depends on
how good the talk is.

12:23.608 --> 12:25.375
<i>(mumbling)</i> sittin'
in the camaro, talkin'...

12:25.376 --> 12:28.012
They could be...
<i>(mumbles)</i>

12:28.013 --> 12:30.280
...Hour and a half...
<i>(mumbles)</i>

12:34.953 --> 12:38.221
It'd have to be a hell of
a lot better than that.

12:43.195 --> 12:46.330
Hey, little buddy.
How was practice?

12:46.331 --> 12:49.967
Fine. Where have you been?
I've been waiting here
for 20 minutes.

12:49.968 --> 12:52.870
Sorry. Buckle up.

12:52.871 --> 12:55.139
I had to stop by the bookstore.

12:58.143 --> 13:00.844
Sorry, dad. I got hit
in the head with the puck.

13:00.845 --> 13:05.116
I just thought
you said "bookstore."

13:05.117 --> 13:07.084
I did say bookstore.

13:07.085 --> 13:10.388
Your mom's book discussion group
is stopping
by the house next week

13:10.389 --> 13:12.956
And I'm gonna read
the book they're reading.

13:14.993 --> 13:16.627
Why?

13:18.163 --> 13:21.865
To prove I'm just
as interested in reading
as the next guy.

13:23.468 --> 13:27.338
Is the next guy also reading
in dolby stereo?

13:29.474 --> 13:32.876
There's no better way to read
a classic than in a classic car.

13:32.877 --> 13:35.078
Pop that thing in.

13:36.748 --> 13:40.017
<i>(man) "madame bovary."</i>
<i>by gustave flaubert.</i>

13:40.018 --> 13:42.486
<i>A brilliant</i>
<i>psychological portrait</i>

13:42.487 --> 13:46.190
<i>Which searingly depicts</i>
<i>a woman's mind in search</i>
<i>of transcendence.</i>

13:46.191 --> 13:47.892
Fast-forward it.
Fast-forward it.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.726
<i>(tape winding)</i>

13:49.727 --> 13:52.930
<i>...Innocent maidens</i>
<i>with tears on their cheeks</i>

13:52.931 --> 13:56.200
<i>Were kissing turtle doves</i>
<i>through the bars</i>
<i>of a gothic cage.</i>

13:56.201 --> 13:57.868
Fast-forward! Fast-forward!
Fast-forward!

13:57.869 --> 14:00.204
<i>(tape winding)</i>

14:00.205 --> 14:02.807
<i>Little pieces of embroidery...</i>
Oh, man. Turn it over.

14:02.808 --> 14:05.276
Maybe there's something better
on the other side.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.980
Ok. I have my favorite tea,
earl grey.

14:09.981 --> 14:13.284
And since we're reading
a french book -
voilà, french pastries.

14:13.285 --> 14:14.751
Éclairs?
Of course.

14:14.752 --> 14:17.087
Oh, my favorite!
Hi, everybody!

14:17.088 --> 14:20.357
Hi.
This is my husband, tim.

14:20.358 --> 14:23.593
Oh, I already know chris.
Nice to see you again, tim.

14:23.594 --> 14:26.631
And this is sharon,
jane and carol.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.966
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

14:28.967 --> 14:31.736
"you" is a pronoun, you know.

14:37.642 --> 14:42.747
Ah, tea! Nice cup of tea.
I'm a big tea guy myself.

14:42.748 --> 14:46.049
You like earl grey?
Don't know the guy, chris.

14:47.352 --> 14:50.187
Jill, you didn't tell us
you had such a witty husband.

14:50.188 --> 14:52.289
I didn't know.

14:53.791 --> 14:56.560
So, don't you have
a poker game tonight?

14:56.561 --> 14:58.796
You know, I thought
I'd blow it off tonight.

14:58.797 --> 15:01.565
What?
In the hopes of joining
the book group.

15:06.171 --> 15:09.206
Uh, tim, to participate
in this book group,

15:09.207 --> 15:12.076
You have to have read
<i>madame bovary.</i>

15:12.077 --> 15:17.681
Ah, yes! Flaubert's brilliant
psychological profile...

15:17.682 --> 15:20.817
Of a woman in search
of transcendence.

15:23.188 --> 15:26.390
I think that's
a very astute synopsis.

15:26.391 --> 15:30.561
I've always been
a very astute synopsizer.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.096
Oh! Excuse me, sorry.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.832
Tim, I just really don't think
this is a very good idea.

15:34.833 --> 15:38.402
I just think it's wonderful
that you have a husband
who shares your interests.

15:38.403 --> 15:42.006
You wouldn't catch my husband
at book group.
You're lucky, jill.

15:42.007 --> 15:45.176
To synopsize what woman are
saying - I think they'd
like me part of this group.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.345
Oh, that's a great idea!

15:47.346 --> 15:48.778
Ok, good.

15:48.779 --> 15:52.583
Ok, why don't I just sit
right in here?

15:52.584 --> 15:54.951
Whoa! Still warm!

15:57.888 --> 16:02.025
Well, uh, let's plunge in.
I was hooked by chapter one.

16:02.026 --> 16:05.061
Can we fast-forward
through chapter one?

16:06.398 --> 16:09.567
Go right to chapter ten.
Why chapter ten?

16:09.568 --> 16:13.003
They introduce a character -
lestiboudois.

16:17.942 --> 16:20.211
Who is lestiboudois?

16:20.212 --> 16:23.480
The village handyman.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.885
What an interesting perspective.

16:27.886 --> 16:30.153
I have never heard
anyone discuss <i>madame bovary</i>

16:30.154 --> 16:33.090
From the point of view
of the handyman!

16:33.091 --> 16:38.062
That's because he has absolutely
no relevance to the story.

16:38.063 --> 16:40.998
<i>Au contraire.</i>

16:42.634 --> 16:46.470
He was the one that set up
all the chairs for the fair.

16:46.471 --> 16:48.038
I kind of see
what you're saying.

16:48.039 --> 16:49.974
If lestiboudois hadn't
set up the chairs,

16:49.975 --> 16:53.677
Madame bovary would not
have been able to sit
next to rodolphe.

16:53.678 --> 16:56.013
My point exactly.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.950
What's your feeling
on rodolphe, tim?

16:59.951 --> 17:02.319
Rodolphe, tim?

17:04.188 --> 17:09.827
I'm not real clear on
his character at this point.

17:09.828 --> 17:13.097
You don't remember the main
love interest in the story?

17:13.098 --> 17:16.700
A sensitive man like tim
was probably more drawn to leon.

17:16.701 --> 17:18.535
Yes, I was.

17:20.037 --> 17:23.406
And, uh, forgive me,
leon was the one that, uh...

17:23.407 --> 17:26.510
The man that she connected with
on a deeper level.

17:26.511 --> 17:28.879
Madame bovary's soul mate.
Soul mate?

17:28.880 --> 17:33.117
Madame bovary was going
to leave her dimwitted husband
for him.

17:33.118 --> 17:36.520
<i>(mumbling)</i> I didn't like leon.
I don't like that.

17:36.521 --> 17:40.991
So the only character you liked
was the handyman?

17:40.992 --> 17:44.328
No. I think the hero
of this fine novel

17:44.329 --> 17:46.730
Would have to be the husband.

17:46.731 --> 17:48.466
<i>(all laugh)</i>

17:48.467 --> 17:50.935
He was
the quintessential dullard.

17:50.936 --> 17:53.637
Well, dullard or mallard,
I don't care!

17:55.673 --> 17:58.008
She was married,
and only her husband
should be allowed

17:58.009 --> 18:00.744
Near madame's ovaries.

18:15.726 --> 18:18.295
Would anybody like more tea?

18:21.066 --> 18:23.533
Well, this was a lot of fun.
Thanks for coming.

18:23.534 --> 18:26.203
What are we going to read
next week?
<i>The fountainhead.</i>

18:26.204 --> 18:29.606
Plumbing! I'm in!

18:29.607 --> 18:32.309
Oh, chris,
jill won't be needing
a ride next week.

18:32.310 --> 18:34.511
I'll take her.
Ok.

18:34.512 --> 18:36.880
I'll see you in class
tomorrow, jill?
Yes, yes.

18:36.881 --> 18:39.950
Thank you. Goodbye!
Bye now!

18:42.820 --> 18:46.923
Well, that was quite a display
you put on here tonight!

18:46.924 --> 18:51.028
Yeah, I really wowed 'em
with that intellectual
razzmatazz, didn't I?

18:54.499 --> 18:57.401
You were checking up on me.

18:57.402 --> 19:00.237
No, I wasn't!
What did you think
was gonna happen?

19:00.238 --> 19:03.307
Did you think that chris
and I were just gonna make
wild, passionate love

19:03.308 --> 19:05.409
Right here in front
of the book club?

19:05.410 --> 19:08.211
Would have probably been
more exciting.

19:09.814 --> 19:12.483
You didn't have to do that.
Yes, I did.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.684
I did this to prove that
I could be your soul mate.

19:14.685 --> 19:17.520
What are you talking about?
Soul mate?

19:17.521 --> 19:21.091
The person that can talk about
stuff you're passionate about?

19:21.092 --> 19:23.060
Well, by that definition,

19:23.061 --> 19:26.963
Your soul mate would be
the guy who rotates your tires!

19:28.299 --> 19:32.369
Now, now, you leave murray
out of this!

19:32.370 --> 19:35.506
This is between you and chris.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.940
Wait a second.

19:36.941 --> 19:39.576
You think that chris
is my soul mate?

19:39.577 --> 19:42.446
Yes, I do.
He can talk about stuff
I don't know about.

19:42.447 --> 19:45.549
He's taking your mind
and leaving me with your body.

19:51.422 --> 19:54.091
Back the soul train up, here.

19:55.626 --> 20:00.797
You're more interested
in my mind than my body.

20:00.798 --> 20:03.800
Hey, no one's more surprised
than me.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.674
After all these years,

20:10.675 --> 20:14.245
Why would you think
that anybody else
could be my soul mate?

20:14.246 --> 20:16.914
I don't know.
I was out talking to wilson.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.316
We were talking about
what women really want.

20:19.317 --> 20:21.484
And then all I could do was
picture myself sitting alone
in my yard

20:21.485 --> 20:24.154
Squeezing my apples.

20:29.227 --> 20:31.628
Tim, chris and I may have
some common interests,

20:31.629 --> 20:33.764
But it can't compare
to what I have with you.

20:33.765 --> 20:36.066
It can't?

20:36.067 --> 20:41.738
I share my life with you.
I share my love with you.

20:41.739 --> 20:44.675
All we have to do is
look at one another
and we know exactly

20:44.676 --> 20:48.178
What the other person
is thinking.
That's true.

20:48.179 --> 20:51.581
If that's not a soul mate,
I don't know what is.

20:51.582 --> 20:54.217
So what am I thinking
right now?

20:57.021 --> 21:00.356
That you read <i>madame bovary</i>
for nothing.

21:01.859 --> 21:04.460
Painful day.

21:04.461 --> 21:06.563
You are my soul mate.

21:13.637 --> 21:18.141
Can you believe it?
Four jacks again,
read 'em and weep.

21:18.142 --> 21:22.679
I guess you guys learned
a lesson - don't play
with the poker champ.

21:22.680 --> 21:26.282
You must be real proud
of yourself, dad.

21:26.283 --> 21:30.421
Wiping out three kids
who've never played poker
before.

21:30.422 --> 21:33.990
Well, hustle up
and get your piggy banks
and bring daddy his money.

21:36.060 --> 21:39.730
I'll give you an I.O.U.
I'll need some id.

21:41.232 --> 21:44.234
After I finish my homework.
You need any help?

21:44.235 --> 21:48.071
No. Just got a little book
to read. <i>Tale of two cities.</i>

21:51.676 --> 21:54.411
Don't play a tape!
Read the book, will ya, randy?

21:54.412 --> 21:56.847
I got the idea from you.

21:56.848 --> 21:59.883
Well, don't tell your mom
you got the idea from me.

21:59.884 --> 22:02.652
Don't worry, dad.
She's not gonna find out.

22:02.653 --> 22:07.156
<i>(man) "a tale of two cities,"</i>
<i>by charles dickens.</i>

22:07.157 --> 22:10.827
<i>"it was the best of times;</i>
<i>it was the worst of times."</i>

22:10.828 --> 22:12.662
<i>(jill) it's gonna be</i>
<i>the worst of times for you</i>

22:12.663 --> 22:16.500
<i>If you don't turn this off</i>
<i>and go read the book.</i>

22:20.772 --> 22:23.373
<i>Oh, and I don't care</i>
<i>what your father told you.</i>

22:23.374 --> 22:26.142
Hey, fast-forward past
that thing.

22:28.613 --> 22:31.181
Sorry, dad, I got hit in
the head with the puck.

22:31.182 --> 22:35.552
I just thought...
I just thought
you said bookstore.

22:35.553 --> 22:37.787
I did say bookstore.

22:37.788 --> 22:40.957
Your mom's book
discussion group is...
<i>(mumbles)</i>

22:42.960 --> 22:46.597
What am I thinking right now?

22:46.598 --> 22:50.267
You're thinking that you read
<i>madame bovary</i> for nothing.

22:50.268 --> 22:53.837
Oh. Ohh...

22:53.838 --> 22:55.839
We are soul mates.

23:01.612 --> 23:03.914
<i>(director)</i> thank you.
We're not done yet.

23:05.916 --> 23:07.884
Come on! I was just getting
going here!

23:07.885 --> 23:09.786
Working up a little steam.
